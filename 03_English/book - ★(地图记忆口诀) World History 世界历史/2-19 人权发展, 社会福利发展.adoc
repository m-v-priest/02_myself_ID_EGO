Some of the most profound changes brought by industrialization were those that affected the workplace, bringing new challenges while also transforming the nature of labor.

工业化带来的一些最深刻的变化影响了工作场所，带来了新的挑战，同时也改变了劳动的性质。(科技改变生活方式，于是旧的生活传统就消失了，再也回不去，成了回忆)

==  反技术变革的努力 (卢德分子, 1811)

Some workers rebelled against industrialization, which threatened their status as skilled laborers. Beginning in 1811, a secretive group of British textile workers calling themselves Luddites began destroying textile machinery, rioting, and setting fires in response to the industrialization of their workplaces. Today, “Luddite” is often used as a generic description of anyone opposed to technological change.

一些工人反抗"工业化"，这威胁到他们作为熟练工人的地位。从 1811 年开始，一群自称“卢德分子”的英国纺织工人秘密组织, 开始破坏纺织机械、制造骚乱和纵火，以应对工作场所的工业化。如今，“卢德分子”经常被用作对任何"反对技术变革的人"的通用描述。

==  (工业革命后) 工人面临恶劣的工作生态

=== 工作条件不掌握在自己手里 ← 从传统社会的自给自足, 到给资本家打工后, 工人失去了”工作条件”上自我控制权.

Industrialization, motivated and enabled by capitalism, created tremendous wealth for business owners and middle-class professionals, but their profits often came at a high cost to workers. The production of goods shifted from the handiwork of highly skilled middle-class artisans to mechanized production done by low-paid unskilled laborers.

Workers did enjoy access to new consumer goods made cheaper by industrialization, but to afford those goods they had to work long hours, in difficult and often dangerous conditions. Perhaps most importantly, workers lost control over their working conditions. Farmers and artisans, particularly those who owned their land or shops, were free to decide how and when they worked, whereas factory owners carefully regulated every aspect of their workers’ professional and even personal lives.

在资本主义的推动和推动下，"工业化"为企业主和中产阶级专业人士, 创造了巨大的财富，但他们的利润往往以工人的高昂成本为代价。商品生产, 从"高技能中产阶级工匠"的"手工生产", 转向"低薪非熟练工人"的"机械化生产"。

工人们确实享受到了因工业化而变得更便宜的新消费品，但为了买得起这些商品，他们必须 在困难且常常危险的条件下, 长时间工作。也许最重要的是，工人们失去了对"工作条件"的控制。农民和工匠，特别是那些拥有土地或商店的人(有产者)，可以自由决定他们工作的方式和时间; 而工人(无产者)则被工厂主仔细规范他们个人生活的各个方面。

'''

===  工作时间长  ← 有了电之后, 晚上工厂也能运行, 导致工人的工作时间大大加长

With electric lights, the factory floor could be lit twenty-four hours a day, and workers could labor long into the night in all seasons.

有了电灯，工厂车间就可以一天二十四小时都亮着，工人们可以在任何季节工作到深夜。

Luckily for the subjects of the tsar, the majority of Russian factory workers could look forward to nearly one hundred holidays per year. They would have been envied by Japan’s cotton spinners, teenaged women who often worked for seventeen-hour stretches punctuated only by short breaks.

十九世纪的工人通常每天工作10-12个小时，每周工作6天。 1897 年，俄罗斯改革法将工作日从14小时（有时多达18小时）减少到只有11.5小时。对于沙皇的臣民来说幸运的是，大多数俄罗斯工厂工人每年可以期待近100个假期。她们会受到日本棉纺工的羡慕，这些十几岁的女性经常连续工作17个小时，中间只有短暂的休息。

'''

===  工伤致残

The pace and long hours of mechanized labor took a toll on workers’ health and safety. Injuries were common. 

Fingers and hands were often lost to moving machine parts. 

Constant standing resulted in back problems, swollen feet, and miscarriages. 

In textile factories, inhaled fibers caused breathing problems that left workers permanently disabled. 

The constant noise of machinery led to hearing loss. 

Summer temperatures combined with the heat generated by machinery and moving bodies left workers on the brink of heat exhaustion. 

Laborers in Japan’s silk industry were often scalded while boiling silkworm cocoons. 

Toxic chemicals used in largely unregulated production processes also played havoc with workers’ health and safety. 

In some places, workers, especially women, were beaten by their supervisors; young women sent to work in the Japanese cotton industry by their impoverished parents were often caned or whipped.

受伤很常见:  +
手指被机器弄残废.  +
长时间站立导致背伤, 脚步肿胀, 怀孕者流产. +
吸入纤维, 导致肺部呼吸损害, 永久致残. (在纺织厂中) +
持续不断的机械噪音, 导致听力受损. +
夏天高温, 与机器产生的热量, 导致工人处于中暑边缘. +
丝绸业的工人在煮蚕茧时, 经常被烫伤. +
因在不受监管的生产过程中, 使用有毒化学品, 而造成伤亡. +
工人, 尤其是妇女, 遭受主管殴打, 鞭打.

Living in a working-class quarter, coming in contact with laborers and their wives, I could not fail to hear tales of the dangers that workingmen faced, of cases of carbonmonoxide gassing in the great steel mills, of painters disabled by lead palsy, of pneumonia and rheumatism among the men in the stockyards. Illinois then had no legislation providing compensation for accident or disease caused by occupation. . .

我住在工人阶级区，与工人和他们的妻子接触，我总是听到工人们面临危险的故事，大钢铁厂里一氧化碳毒气事件，油漆工因"铅中毒"而致残，牲畜场里的工人患"肺炎"和"风湿病"。伊利诺伊州当时没有立法, 为职业造成的事故或疾病提供赔偿。

.磷中毒性颌骨坏死

Phossy jaw is a very distressing form of industrial disease. It comes from breathing the fumes of white or yellow phosphorus, which gives off fumes at room temperature, or from putting into the mouth food or gum or fingers smeared with phosphorus. Even drinking from a glass which has stood on the workbench is dangerous. The phosphorus penetrates into a defective tooth and down through the roots to the jawbone, killing the tissue cells which then become the prey of suppurative germs from the mouth, and abscesses form. The jaw swells and the pain is intense. . . . Sometimes the abscess forms in the upper jaw and works up into the orbit, causing the loss of an eye. In severe cases one lower jawbone may have to be removed, or an upper jawbone—perhaps both.

“磷毒性颌骨坏死”是一种非常令人痛苦的工业疾病。它来自吸入在室温下会产生烟雾的白磷或黄磷，或将沾有磷的食物、口香糖或手指放进嘴里。即使用放在工作台上的杯子喝水也是危险的。磷会渗入有缺陷的牙齿，从牙根向下到达颌骨，杀死组织细胞，这些组织细胞随后成为口腔化脓性细菌的猎物，形成脓肿。下巴肿胀，疼痛剧烈… 有时脓肿在上颚形成，并扩散到眼眶，导致失去一只眼睛。在严重的情况下，可能需要切除一块下颚骨，或者一块上颚骨——也许两者都要切除。

Occupational Disease: Phosphorus Necrosis +
This set of undated photographs depicts a Dutch woman whose lower jaw has been eaten away by phosphorus, a condition commonly known as “phossy jaw.” The use of phosphorus for match production in the Netherlands was banned in 1901.

职业病：磷坏死 +
这组未注明日期的照片描绘了一位荷兰妇女，她的下颌已被磷侵蚀，这种情况通常被称为“下颌磷”。荷兰于 1901 年禁止 在火柴生产中使用磷。

===  两害相权取其轻

Despite low pay, long hours, and difficult conditions of factory work, many working-class people preferred it to other types of available labor. Jobs like driving wagons and unloading ships were also low-paying jobs but required working outside in all kinds of weather. Railroad workers were vulnerable to incapacitating injuries from being caught between railcars or falling under their wheels. Miners toiled in dark, cramped environments, where temperatures sometimes rose so high they had to work naked to keep from passing out. Cave-ins were a constant threat. Industrial labor, regardless of the type, was also more highly paid than agricultural labor.

尽管工厂工作工资低、工作时间长、条件艰苦，但与其他类型的可选择工作相比，许多工人还是更倾向它。驾驶货车和卸船等工作虽然也是低薪工作，但需要在各种天气下在户外工作。铁路工人很容易被夹在火车车厢之间或掉到车轮下而造成伤残。矿工们在黑暗、狭窄的环境中辛苦劳作，那里的温度有时非常高，他们不得不裸体工作，以免昏倒。塌方是一个持续的威胁。工业劳动力，无论何种类型，都比农业劳动力的收入更高。

'''

===  环境污染造成的健康伤害 → 呼吸系统疾病

City air was also dirty in the late nineteenth century. Coal was burned to generate both steam power and electricity, and coal smoke plagued industrial cities as they grew in size.

Respiratory problems caused by the inhalation of coal smoke affected many in the nineteenth century. Emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and asthma were common. Approximately one-third of child deaths in nineteenth-century England were attributed to respiratory ailments.

十九世纪末，城市空气也很脏。人们通过燃烧煤, 来产生蒸汽动力和电力，随着工业城市规模的扩大，煤烟问题一直困扰着它们。

十九世纪，许多人因吸入煤烟, 而引起"呼吸系统疾病"。"肺气肿"、"慢性支气管炎"和"哮喘"很常见。十九世纪, 英国大约三分之一的儿童死于"呼吸系统疾病"。

'''

===  卖淫导致性病传播

Prostitution, both formal and informal, was common in nineteenth-century cities. Some prostitutes were professionals who lived in brothels, but many others were simply young single women who could not survive on their meager wages alone.

Sexually transmitted diseases were rampant, however. Many prostitutes and their clients suffered from syphilis, and married men sometimes infected their wives. The result was infertility or babies who were stillborn or blind or had mental disabilities. With no effective cure, syphilis killed its victims after years of agony.

正式和非正式的卖淫, 在十九世纪的城市中都很常见。有些妓女是住在妓院的职业人士，但其他许多妓女只是年轻的单身女性，仅靠微薄的工资无法生存。

然而，性传播疾病却十分猖獗。许多妓女及其嫖客都患有"梅毒"， 已婚男子有时也会传染给他们的妻子。结果是不孕、婴儿死产、失明, 或患有精神障碍。由于没有有效的治疗方法，梅毒患者会在经受多年的痛苦后,死亡。

'''

===  失业 ← 不再自给自足后, 由于经济周期, 资本主义下工厂会关闭, 导致工人周期性失业

Work was not always steady; workplaces sometimes shut down unexpectedly when raw materials or work orders fell short. This meant that low pay was often accompanied by periodic unemployment, for which workers had no safety net. Most governments did not provide unemployment insurance, and government-subsidized housing for the poor did not exist. When workers lost their jobs, they were forced to turn to religious institutions or private charities for money for food and rent.

工作并不总是稳定的；当原材料或工单短缺时，工作场所有时会意外关闭。 这意味着低工资往往伴随着周期性失业，而工人没有安全网。大多数政府不提供失业保险，也不存在为穷人提供的政府补贴住房。当工人失业时，他们被迫向宗教机构或私人慈善机构寻求食物和租金。

Between 1873 and the end of the century, periodic recessions and depressions alternated with boom periods, rocking economies around the world.

1873 年至本世纪末，周期性的衰退和萧条与繁荣时期交替出现，震撼了世界各地的经济。

'''

===  未婚女性的工作生态

Factory work was especially desirable to unmarried women, whose most common alternative was domestic service. Living in their employers’ homes, domestic workers were expected to be available at all times of the day and night, were constantly watched, and made very little money. On the factory floor, unmarried young women might be sexually harassed by male employers, supervisors, or coworkers.

工厂工作对未婚女性来说尤其有吸引力，她们最常见的选择是"家政服务"。住在雇主家中的家庭佣工, 被要求全天候待命，经常受到监视，而且赚的钱很少。在工厂车间，未婚的年轻女性可能会受到男性雇主、主管或同事的"性骚扰"。

Because women were paid less than men, unmarried women did not earn enough to live independently. They tended to live at home, where they were expected to give their wages to their parents and accept a small allowance in return. Even if they rented living quarters with other female workers and shared expenses, they might grant sexual favors to young men in exchange for meals or clothes, a form of casual prostitution known as “treating.”

Nevertheless, many young female factory workers enjoyed relative independence before marriage, and the inexpensive entertainment found in industrial cities.

由于女性的工资低于男性，未婚女性的收入不足以独立生活。他们往往住在家里，将工资交给父母, 并接受少量津贴作为回报。即使她们与其他女工合租住所, 并分摊费用，她们也可能向年轻男性提供"性服务"，以换取食物或衣服，这是一种被称为“招待”的临时卖淫形式。

尽管如此，许多年轻的工厂女工在婚前享有相对独立，以及能在工业城市找到廉价的娱乐活动。

'''

==  罢工合法化 (英国, 1871, 1875)

In 1871, the British government legalized their existence, and in 1875, Parliament made it legal for workers to strike as well.

1871年，英国政府使罢工合法化，1875年，议会也使工人罢工合法化。

'''

==  工厂中的妇女减少 (19世纪末)

Early in the Industrial Revolution, women and children worked in factories, but by the end of the nineteenth century, this situation had changed. Although increasing mechanization meant that workers needed less physical strength, the presence of women and children in the workplace declined.

工业革命初期， 妇女和儿童会在工厂工作，但到了19世纪末，妇女和儿童的数量才开始减少. 

'''

===  工作女性减少的原因

Indeed, many male laborers blamed women’s willingness to accept low wages for keeping their own pay low, and they sought to push women out of the workplace.

妇女减少的原因是: 男性工人认为”女性愿意接受低收入” 抢了自己饭碗, 导致男性薪水无法提高. 于是对工作女性抱有敌意.

'''

===  到20世纪初时, 女性倾向于在家工作

by the beginning of the twentieth century in the United States, France, Great Britain, and Germany, working-class wives tended to supplement the family’s income by working at home, not outside it. Unmarried women and those whose husbands were disabled or absent still sought factory work, but married women more commonly earned money in ways that did not require them to leave the home.

Some cared for the children of working neighbors and took in laundry.

If the family’s living space were large enough, they might take in boarders.

Many women did piecework at home, compensated based on the number of items produced. They collected materials from local businesses and assembled small items like toys, costume jewelry, or artificial flowers. Some stitched together items of clothing.

They were often joined by their children, who might also hawk newspapers and peddle wares on the street.

到了二十世纪初，在美国、法国、英国和德国，工人阶级的妻子, 倾向于在家工作, 而不是外出工作来补充家庭收入。"未婚妇女", 和"丈夫残疾, 或丈夫不在身边的妇女", 仍然寻求工厂工作，但"已婚妇女"更常见的是通过不需要离开家的方式来赚钱。

- 有些人选择照顾工作邻居的孩子, 并洗衣服。
- 如果家里的居住空间足够大，他们可能会收住"寄宿生".
- 许多妇女在家做"计件工作"，根据生产的物品数量, 获得报酬。她们从当地企业收集材料, 并组装玩具、人造珠宝, 或人造花等小物品。有些人把衣服缝在一起。

她们的孩子经常加入她们的行列，孩子们也可能在街上兜售报纸, 和兜售商品.

'''

==  童工现象减少  (19世纪末)

=== 童工能禁止的原因

In the United States and western Europe, children also had largely ceased working in most factories by the beginning of the twentieth century. Greater mechanization of the workplace eliminated the jobs that children had once been employed to do. Increasingly, too, governments passed laws that attempted to ban child labor.

Britain, the first nation to industrialize, led the way in eliminating child labor.

In the face of such opposition to limits on it, child labor continued until laws requiring compulsory education helped to move children from factories to schoolrooms. By the end of the nineteenth century, new laws in the United States and western and central Europe mandated schooling, largely eliminating formal wage work by children under the age of fourteen.

童工减少的原因是: ① 机械化程度提高, 不需要童工了. ②各国政府通过法律, 来禁止童工的存在. ③ 义务教育法, 让儿童要去上学, 而非失学去工作. 

英国在”消除童工”方面的努力, 处于领先地位。


'''

==  第一次世界大战, 令女性获得投票权, 选举权

The sense of independence and the novelty of making their own money spurred many women involved in the war effort to see political reform and voting rights as the next step. For example, many women in Britain viewed the extension of voting rights as a way to reward them for their war work. 

Suffragists had been protesting for years about the need to include women among the voting population in numerous countries such as Britain, Germany, and the United States. 

In 1918, Britain extended the right to vote to property-owning women over thirty. Germany gave women the vote in 1918, the first country to grant universal adult female suffrage, as did the United States in 1920.

许多参战的妇女，她们把政治改革和获得投票权视为下一步。许多英国妇女将投票权的扩大, 视为对她们在战争中所做贡献的一种奖励。

1918年，英国将选举权扩大到30岁以上有财产的妇女。德国在1918年给予妇女投票权，是第一个给予成年女性普遍选举权的国家，美国在1920年也给予妇女投票权。

'''

==  一战后, 美国原住民获得美国公民身份

Several minority groups in the United States hoped military service would gain them wider acceptance and rights. More than eleven thousand Native Americans served in the military during the war, and many hoped this volunteer service would provide them U.S. citizenship. Native Americans were in fact granted citizenship in 1924.

美国原住民希望通过服兵役, 能让他们获得美国公民身份。到1924年, 他们就获得了公民身份.

- 美国非洲裔的参加一战, 并没有怎么提高他们的被歧视待遇

Another group hoping for change were African Americans. Long subject to discriminatory laws and racial segregation, African Americans felt World War I offered them an opportunity to prove themselves loyal citizens. The United States operated a segregated military, and all-Black service member units serving overseas had a unique chance to see how other places treated them. Those in France, in particular, were struck by the freedom of movement and acceptance they found there. They were allowed in combat, while U.S. units kept them largely in support roles. There was genuine optimism that life in the United States would be different after the war.

However, after 1918, many found that little had changed. Discriminatory laws remained in place, and poor treatment even of veterans was commonplace.

另一个希望改变的群体是非裔美国人。长期受到"歧视性法律"和"种族隔离"的影响， 非裔美国人认为第一次世界大战为他们提供了证明自己忠诚公民的机会。美国实行"种族隔离"的军队，在海外服役的全黑人军人部队, 有了独特的机会, 来了解其他地方会如何对待他们。尤其是在法国时，他们对那里的"行动自由"和"被接受程度"感到震惊。他们被允许参加战斗，而美军则只让他们主要承担支援角色。

人们真诚地乐观地认为，战后美国的生活会有所不同。然而，1918 年之后，许多人发现情况几乎没有改变。歧视性法律仍然存在，甚至对退伍军人的恶劣待遇也很常见。

'''

==  二战时, 人民的生活 → 粮食短缺, 配给供应

Where economies were less modern, it was difficult to increase production. Laborers were lost, either through death or because they were sent to Germany to work. As many as twelve million forced laborers from twenty different countries, mostly in eastern and central Europe, fell under German control, further depressing the production of civilian goods.

Since most resources were funneled toward the Germans and away from local populations, much of Europe had to solve the problems of food shortages, rationing, and black markets.

在经济不太现代化的地方，很难增加产量。劳工流失，要么是因为死亡，要么是因为他们被派往德国工作。来自二十个不同国家（主要是东欧和中欧）的多达一千二百万强迫劳工, 落入德国的控制之下，进一步抑制了民用产品的生产。

由于大部分资源都流向了德国人, 而不是当地居民，欧洲大部分地区必须解决粮食短缺、定量配给, 和黑市的问题。

'''

===  东欧情况

Despite German hopes, eastern Europe exported to Germany only 800,000 tons of bread over the course of the war, and hunger and starvation became common experiences for resident populations.

尽管德国抱有希望，但东欧在战争期间仅向德国出口了80万吨面包，饥饿和饥荒成为居民的普遍经历。

- 挪威情况

In Norway, the country lost all its foreign trade partners, and its entire economy became tilted toward Germany. The result was that only about 40 percent of Norwegian production was left for consumption by Norwegians, necessitating rationing.

在挪威，该国失去了所有的对外贸易伙伴，整个经济向德国倾斜。结果是，挪威的产量只有约 40% 供挪威人消费，因此需要实行定量配给。

'''

===  希腊情况

In Greece, the appropriation of foodstuffs led to a famine that killed a quarter of a million people in the winter of 1941–1942, including 90 percent of the babies born.

在希腊，对食品的侵占导致了 1941 年至 1942 年冬季 25 万人死亡的饥荒，其中包括 90% 的婴儿。

'''

===  德国情况

The Germans instituted a four-year economic plan in 1936, and rationing began in August 1939. The first few years of the war brought little change in their standard of living, but by early 1945, rationing had grown uncomfortably tight.

德国人于 1936 年制定了四年经济计划，并于 1939 年 8 月开始配给。战争的头几年几乎没有给他们的生活水平带来什么变化，但到 1945 年初，配给已经变得令人不安地紧张。

'''

==  二战是场全民战争, 几乎不分前线和后方

For European countries in World War II, the distance between the battlefield and the home front was often very short or nonexistent. Total war, fought using all available resources with no restrictions on weapons or their targets, took the conflict to millions.

对于二战中的欧洲国家来说，战场与后方的距离往往很短，甚至根本不存在。全面战争是利用一切可用资源进行的，对武器或目标没有任何限制，导致数百万人陷入冲突。

The Allied bombing of Japan was severe as well. The U.S. Air Force destroyed sixty-nine Japanese cities. The March 1945 raid on Tokyo alone killed between 80,000 and 100,000 people and destroyed the homes of a million more. By 1945, Japan was on the verge of economic collapse.

盟军对日本的轰炸也很严重。美国空军摧毁了六十九个日本城市。仅 1945 年 3 月对东京的空袭就造成 80,000 至 100,000 人死亡，并摧毁了 100 万人的房屋。到了1945年，日本处于经济崩溃的边缘。

'''

==  二战中, 各国的死亡人数

The United States and the United Kingdom emerged less battered, with 416,000 American and 384,000 British deaths. 

Japan lost 2.1 million military and another million civilians. 

Germany had suffered 5.5 million military deaths and lost as many as three million civilians. 

China’s military deaths can only be approximated but may have been as high as four million, with another sixteen million civilians. 

Soviet military deaths were estimated at 8.8 to 10.7 million, and more than thirteen million civilian deaths were attributed to the war.

(战争结束后)，美国和英国受到的打击较小，美国有 416,000 人死亡，英国有 384,000 人死亡。

日本损失了 210 万军人和 100 万平民。

德国有 550 万名军人死亡，多达 300 万平民丧生。

中国的军人死亡人数只能估算，但可能高达 400 万人，另有 1600 万名平民。

战争导致苏联军人死亡人数估计为 8.8 至 1,070 万人，超过 1300 万平民死亡。

'''

==  非洲人也参与二战, 以此作为战后自己国家能独立的”前提贡献”.

Along with becoming a theater of battle in its northern lands, Africa was also drawn into World War II when Africans were enlisted into the armies fighting fascism. More than a million African soldiers fought in Europe, North Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific or provided labor for colonial forces during the war. Most were forcibly recruited and paid far less than White European soldiers. The colonial holdings of the European powers throughout the continent meant that Africa’s resources were available for the war effort. Many Africans saw their loyal contribution to the Allies as a down payment for greater self-determination and independence after the war.

随着非洲北部成为战场，非洲也被卷入第二次世界大战，非洲人被征召入伍对抗法西斯主 义。战争期间，超过一百万非洲士兵在欧洲、北非、东南亚和太平洋地区作战或为殖民军队提供劳动力。大多数人是被强行征召入伍的，而且报酬远低于欧洲白人士兵。欧洲列强在整个非洲大陆的殖民地意味着非洲的资源可用于战争。许多非洲人将他们对同盟国的忠诚贡献视为战后获得更大自决和独立的首付。

'''

==  联合国在人权上的宣言 (1948)

Beginning in 1948, the United Nations (UN) established a series of universal declarations that conceived of all people as deserving of human rights and dignity (Figure 1.3). Three such declarations further affirmed the rights of women (Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, also known as CEDAW, 1979), of children (The Declaration of the Rights of the Child, 1959), and of people with disabilities (The Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons, 1975). The UN regularly requires that member nations report on progress in these areas.

从 1948 年开始，联合国 (UN) 制定了一系列普遍宣言，认为所有人都应享有人权和尊严。三项这样的宣言, 进一步肯定了:  +
→ 妇女的权利: 《消除对妇女一切形式歧视公约》，1979年 +
→ 儿童的权利: 《儿童权利宣言》，1959年 +
→ 残疾人的权利: 《残疾人权利宣言》，1975年。 +
联合国定期要求成员国报告这些领域的进展.
