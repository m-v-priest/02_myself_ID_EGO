The Ottoman Empire had always been predicated on expansion. The Ottoman Empire, 1300–1920. These maps show the extent of the Ottoman Empire at its birth in northern Anatolia, at its height in the seventeenth century, on the eve of World War I, and after the war’s conclusion.

Starting in the 1800s, however, the Ottoman Empire entered a period of waning power as it grew unable to respond to nationalistic challenges.

In the 1820s, nationalist leaders in Greece began fighting the Greek Civil War, and in 1830 Greece gained its independence from the Ottomans.

More countries split off from the Empire in the 1870s, including Serbia, Romania, and Bulgaria.

By the end of the nineteenth century, the demise of the empire, now known as “the sick man of Europe,” was being predicted; only the timing was in question. The Ottoman Empire was no longer strong enough to hold onto its outlying areas, and these grew ever more destabilized. The other powers in Europe watched with concern as the Ottoman Empire became weaker and other countries stepped in to fill the power vacuum, occupying and administering a region but not annexing it as Ottoman influence withdrew.

从19世纪开始，奥斯曼帝国进入了一个权力衰退的时期，因为它越来越无法应对民族主义的挑战。

1820年代，希腊的民族主义领导人开始进行希腊独立战争，并且在1830年，希腊从奥斯曼帝国中获得了独立。

1870 年代，更多国家从帝国分裂出来，包括塞尔维亚、罗马尼亚, 和保加利亚。

到了十九世纪末，人们就预言了这个被称为“欧洲病夫”的帝国的灭亡, 只是时间问题。 奥斯曼帝国不再强大到足以控制其边远地区，这些地区变得越来越不稳定。欧洲其他列强紧密关注着奥斯曼帝国的衰弱，而其他国家则介入填补权力真空，占领和管理这些地区，但并未将其吞并。
