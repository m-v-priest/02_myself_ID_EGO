The Spanish were the first to establish major colonies in North America after Christopher Columbus’s arrival in 1492.

In the early 1500s, Europeans began founding new settlements in the Americas.

在1492 年克里斯托弗·哥伦布(Christopher Columbus) 抵达美洲后，西班牙人是第一个在那里北美建立主要殖民地的国家。

As the fortunes of Spain and Portugal declined in the seventeenth century, England, France, and the Netherlands claimed territory in Asia and the Americas and established their own trading posts on the African coast.

十七世纪，随着西班牙和葡萄牙的衰落，英国、法国和荷兰, 声称在亚洲和美洲拥有领土，并在非洲海岸建立了自己的贸易站。

===  加勒比海岛屿情况

Although the mainland colonies yielded wealth for the European home countries, the chief prizes were the islands of the Caribbean where sugar could be grown.

Over the course of the seventeenth century, England, France, and the Netherlands set up colonies throughout the Caribbean on islands either not claimed by Spain or taken from it.

尽管大陆殖民地为欧洲母国带来了财富，但最主要的收获, 是可以种植糖的加勒比海岛屿。

在17世纪，英国、法国和荷兰, 在整个加勒比海地区的岛屿上建立了殖民地，这些岛屿要么未被西班牙声称拥有主权，要么是从西班牙处夺取。

'''

===  中南美洲情况

The three attempted to found colonies in Central or South America as well, but Spanish and Portuguese dominance there either made these efforts unsuccessful, like the Dutch attempts in Brazil, or they kept the colonies small, such as French Guiana and Dutch Guiana, now Suriname.

英国、法国, 荷兰, 这三国也试图在中美洲或南美洲建立殖民地，但西班牙和葡萄牙在那里的统治, 要么使这三国的努力失败 (就像荷兰在巴西的尝试)，要么他们只能保持较小的殖民地 (如"法属圭亚那", 和"荷属圭亚那"，现在的苏里南).

==  第二次”工业革命”时非洲殖民地概况

At the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution, Europeans controlled about 10 percent of the African continent. By the end of the century, they controlled 90 percent, with the largest portions ruled by Britain, France, Belgium, and Germany. Portugal and Spain still claimed colonies acquired in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.

第二次工业革命初期，欧洲人控制了非洲大陆约10%的土地。到本世纪末，他们控制了90%的非洲，其中最大的部分由英国、法国、比利时和德国统治。 葡萄牙和西班牙仍然声称拥有在十四和十五世纪获得的殖民地.

The “Scramble for Africa” reached its height during the Berlin Conference of 1884–1885 when, without input from Africans, European nations simply allotted different parts of the continent to one another. Some agreements were formal recognitions of existing colonies and territories, while others recognized new claims.

In Africa, borders charted to benefit imperialist powers often separated members of the same ethnic group into different countries while forcing hostile groups into the same country. Violent ethnic conflict has been a frequent result.

Colonization continued throughout the 1880s–1910s.

“争夺非洲”在1884 年至 1885 年柏林会议期间, 达到顶峰，当时欧洲国家在没有非洲人参与的情况下，简单地将非洲大陆的不同部分, 分配给彼此。一些协议是"对现有殖民地和领土"的正式承认，而另一些协议则"承认新的主张"。

在非洲，为了帝国主义列强的利益而划定的边界, 常常将同一民族的成员分隔到不同的国家，同时迫使敌对团体进入同一个国家。因此, 暴力的种族冲突经常发生。

殖民化在 1880 年代至 1910 年代持续进行。

==  18世纪开始, 对太平洋殖民地的争夺概况

Colonization of the Pacific by Europeans had begun as early as the sixteenth century when Spain claimed the Philippines.

Over the course of the eighteenth through the early nineteenth centuries, France and Britain had also laid claim to the islands of the Pacific.

Britain established a colony in Australia in 1788 and colonized New Zealand in 1840.

France made Tahiti a protectorate in 1842.

In the second half of the nineteenth century, those islands that did not already belong to a great power were quickly absorbed into larger colonial empires.

早在十六世纪西班牙宣称拥有"菲律宾"主权时，欧洲人就开始了对"太平洋"的殖民活动。

从十八世纪到十九世纪初，法国和英国也对太平洋岛屿提出了主权要求。 +
英国于1788年在"澳大利亚"建立殖民地，并于 1840年对"新西兰"进行殖民统治。 +
法国于1842年将"塔希提岛"设为保护国。 +
在19世纪下半叶，那些原本不属于大国的岛屿, 很快被更大的殖民帝国吞并。

==  19世纪前半段

The hundred years after 1750 marked a profound restructuring of world power and a host of political and economic changes in the Atlantic world. The Revolutionary War (1776–1783), the French Revolution (1789–1799), and the Peninsular War (1808–1814) were watershed events that reverberated across South America on inspiring waves of revolutionary upheavals.

In the first three decades of the nineteenth century, most European American colonies gained their independence.

1750 年之后的百年, 标志着世界权力的深刻重组, 以及大西洋世界的一系列政治和经济变革。美国独立战争（1776- 1783）、法国大革命（1789-1799）和半岛战争（1808-1814）, 是具有里程碑意义的事件，在整个南美洲引起了革命的浪潮。

在十九世纪的前三十年，大多数欧洲的美洲殖民地, 获得了独立。

==  美, 德, 日, 寻求海外殖民地 (19世纪后期开始)

The United States, Germany, and Japan lacked overseas colonies and now sought to acquire them.

(十九世纪后期，) 美国、德国和日本缺乏海外殖民地，现在正寻求获得它们。

In some cases, competing powers agreed to share possession of large islands or island chains. For example, in 1899, Germany, Britain, and the United States formally agreed to divide the Samoan islands between Germany, which took control of those now known as Samoa, and the United States, which received those now called American Samoa. In exchange for Britain’s forfeiting any claim to the islands, Germany gave it control of some of the territory it had settled in the North Solomon Islands and made concessions regarding its holdings in Africa.

在某些情况下，竞争大国同意分享大岛屿或岛链的所有权。例如，1899年，德国、英国和美国正式同意, 将"萨摩亚群岛"划分给德国和美国，德国控制了现在称为"萨摩亚"的岛屿，而美国则接收了现在称为"美属萨摩亚"的岛屿。作为英国放弃对这些岛屿的所有权的交换，德国将其在"北所罗门群岛"定居的部分领土, 交给了英国，并就其在非洲的领土做出了让步。

==  列强在中国争夺”半殖民地”的概况

Following China’s defeat in 1895, European nations and the United States pushed for even more advantages. France gained control over the provinces of Guizhou, Guangxi, and Yunnan. Britain extended its influence along the Yangtze River Valley. Germany was given control of the Yellow River Valley to the north as well as the Shandong Peninsula and Jiaozhou Bay. Soon nearly all the industrialized nations had been granted concessions, enclaves within port cities such as Tianjin and Shanghai, where they exercised the rights of extraterritoriality.

1895年中国(在甲午战争中被日本打败)战败后，欧洲国家和美国进一步谋取更多优势。法国控制了贵州、广西和云南省。英国的影响力扩展到长江流域。德国控制了北部的黄河流域以及山东半岛和胶州湾。很快，几乎所有工业化国家, 都获得了天津和上海等港口城市内的租界和飞地，在那里他们行使"治外法权"。
