Now for a whole lot of European history, women were primarily 主要地；首要地 viewed as mothers. Either they were pre-mothers who hadn't had children yet, or they were mothers proper 真正的；像样的 who had their children, or they were post-mothers whose only real job was to make their husbands a sandwich. But after World War II, that reality began to change significantly 显著地；明显地, and that is what this video is all about. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

Now in the post-World War II environment, new opportunities for women began to emerge 出现；涌现 both in Western Europe and Eastern Europe, and there were several reasons for this. We'll start with the West. First, with the post-war economic boom 繁荣；兴旺 came a high demand for labor. Remember that because of the Marshall Plan funds, Western European economies were humming 活跃；兴旺 right along, and with this terrific 极好的；了不起的 growth came new jobs that needed to be filled. Second, the economies of Western Europe were slowly shifting 转移；转变 away from being primarily dependent on male-dominated industries like coal mining or shipbuilding, and more toward a knowledge economy in which people work primarily with their brain. And because of that, women had an easier time entering those more white-collar 白领的 professions. And third, many younger women started going to college in droves 大量地；成群地 after the war, and that prepared them well for work in the knowledge economy. +

And to be clear, though they had more opportunities, women still faced inequality 不平等 in the workplace. Many women could only find part-time work, and if they did find work, it was almost inevitable 不可避免的；必然发生的 that they would be paid less than men doing the same work. Even so, it was moving in the right direction. +

And to be clear, many of these gains in the West were the results of the efforts of feminists 女权主义者 and what became known as second-wave feminists. The first wave of feminism occurred in the second half of the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century, and its main goal was to get governments to recognize women's right to vote -- or if you want the proper term for it, and I know that you do, women's suffrage 选举权；投票权. But as valiantly 勇敢地；英勇地 as the first-wave feminists fought for this recognition, women's right to vote wouldn't come to full fruition 成果；成就 until the second wave. +

Now in the West, this was the result of feminist activism 行动主义；激进主义. Many governments had already recognized a woman's right to vote because of their profound 深刻的；意义深远的 contribution in the war effort of World War One. Remember that as men left for the war by the millions, women took their places in factories and all manner of other vital 至关重要的；生死攸关的 work that made the war effort possible. Therefore, after the war in 1918, several states made women's suffrage a reality, like Sweden, Hungary, Austria, Poland, Germany, Britain, and Czechoslovakia. Over in the United States, it occurred in 1920. France, dragging its heels 故意拖延, established women's suffrage by 1941. +

But after World War II, many women went back to their roles as wives and mothers, seemingly 似乎；好像 content with having gained such a vital 至关重要的；必不可少的 right. But the second-wave feminists in the 60s and 70s understood that there was much work left to do to achieve equality in a male-dominated society. So whereas the main push during the first wave was to secure 获得；取得 the right to vote, the second wave focused on societal 社会的 issues and inequalities women faced, including education and marriage laws and professional careers. +

Now in France, it was the work of Simone de Beauvoir who laid the foundation for feminist ideals in her book The Second Sex. In it, she argued that the societal standards that govern women's behavior ought to be abolished 废除；废止, and that women should have every opportunity that men had. And her work became the philosophical 哲学的 foundation for second-wave feminism. +

However, in the East -- more specifically in the Soviet Bloc and the Soviet Union -- women gained their rights not by means of feminist agitation 鼓动；煽动 but more directly through government policy. As far back as the Russian Revolution, women had been recognized as equal to men, and in many ways had a greater equality of opportunity than anywhere in the West. However, many of the same troubles plagued 困扰；使烦恼 women in the Soviet countries that befell 降临；发生在……身上 them in the West. +

Now another revolution of women's roles in the 20th century had to do with their rights to marriage and reproduction 生殖；繁殖. For example, divorce laws began to shift, giving women some agency 代理权；自主权 in the divorce process, which prior to this was almost entirely in the hands of the husband. Additionally 此外；另外, women gained more control over the amount of children they had, or whether they had children at all. +

On that front, probably the most significant change was the introduction of the birth control pill. This new technology was largely the effort of the American feminist Margaret Sanger, who poured metric buttloads of cash into the development of this pill. Essentially 本质上；基本上, it was a pill that women could take that regulated 调节；控制 their hormones 荷尔蒙；激素 in such a way that they had a much lower chance of getting pregnant, and then when they wanted to get pregnant, they could just stop taking the pill. +

Now the main pushback 反对；抵制 against what women considered a profound 深刻的；意义深远的 new freedom over their bodies came from the Roman Catholic Church. By their reckoning 估计；推断, it was God who opened and closed the womb, and to introduce a pill that took such a power out of the hands of God was to play God oneself. +

Now another technology that emerged along these lines was in vitro fertilization 体外受精. This was a means by which an egg could be fertilized 使受精 outside the womb and then implanted 移植；植入 into a woman's uterus 子宫. And yes, that gave couples who could not naturally get pregnant a new option for children. But even more, it meant that women could get pregnant apart from being handcuffed 给……戴上手铐；束缚 to a man who was always demanding a sandwich. +

And finally, we need to talk about the gains women made in politics during the latter 后者的；后半的 part of the 20th century. And perhaps the most famous of them was Margaret Thatcher, who became Great Britain's first female prime minister in 1979. She was a fierce 激烈的；猛烈的 conservative 保守派；保守主义者 who made it her goal to reverse 推翻；使逆转 the liberal Labor Party's policies that had been turning Great Britain into a welfare state 福利国家 for decades. She slashed 削减；大刀阔斧地削减 government programs and lowered taxes for the wealthy and privatized 使私有化 many state-run agencies. +

Then in 1990, Mary Robinson rose to power as the first female president of Ireland, and she used her power as president to modernize Ireland -- which is to say that she worked for the legalization 合法化 of many cultural taboos 禁忌；忌讳 like divorce and contraception 避孕；节育 and homosexuality 同性恋. +

And then the first female prime minister of France came to power in 1991, namely 即；也就是 the Socialist Édith Cresson. Her role was not quite as celebrated 著名的；广为人知的 as the first two women I mentioned, since her tenure 任期 was plagued with accusations of corruption 腐败；堕落. But hey, men had been accused of corruption for centuries, so you know, equality. +

== 中文释义

在欧洲历史的很长一段时间里，女性主要被视为母亲。她们要么是还没有孩子的准母亲，要么是已经有孩子的真正的母亲，要么是唯一真正的工作, 就是给丈夫做三明治的产后母亲。但第二次世界大战之后，这种现实开始发生重大变化，而这就是这个视频的主题。所以，如果你准备好获取知识，那就开始吧。 +

在二战后的环境中，西欧和东欧的女性开始迎来新的机遇，这有几个原因。我们先从西欧说起。 +
首先，战后的经济繁荣, 带来了对劳动力的高需求。记住，由于马歇尔计划的资金，西欧经济蓬勃发展，这种巨大的增长, 带来了需要有人填补的新工作岗位。 +
其次，西欧经济慢慢从主要依赖像煤矿开采或造船这样由男性主导的行业，转向更多地依赖知识经济，在知识经济中人们主要靠脑力工作。正因为如此，女性更容易进入那些白领职业。 +
第三，战后许多年轻女性大量涌入大学，这为她们在知识经济中工作做好了准备。 +

需要明确的是，尽管女性有了更多机会，但她们在工作场所仍然面临不平等。许多女性只能找到兼职工作，而且如果她们确实找到了工作，几乎不可避免地，她们做着和男性一样的工作，工资却比男性低。即便如此，情况还是朝着正确的方向发展。 +

同样需要明确的是，西方女性的这些进步, 是"女权主义者"，也就是所谓的 “第二次女权运动” 的参与者努力的结果。*第一次女权运动发生在19世纪后半叶和20世纪初，其主要目标是让政府承认女性的投票权* —— 如果你想知道它的专业术语，我知道你想，那就是 “女性选举权”（women's suffrage）。但是，尽管第一次女权运动的参与者, 勇敢地为获得这种认可而斗争，女性的投票权直到第二次女权运动才完全实现。 +

在西方，这是"女权主义者"积极行动的结果。**由于女性在第一次世界大战的战争努力中, 做出了巨大贡献，许多政府已经承认了女性的投票权。**记住，数百万男性去参战了，女性接替了他们在工厂和各种其他重要工作岗位上的位置，使得战争得以继续进行。因此，*1918年战争结束后，几个国家让"女性选举权"成为了现实，比如瑞典、匈牙利、奥地利、波兰、德国、英国和捷克斯洛伐克。在美国，女性选举权在1920年得以实现。法国行动迟缓，直到1941年才确立了女性选举权。* +

但是第二次世界大战之后，许多女性又回到了妻子和母亲的角色，似乎对获得了这样一项重要权利感到满足。但在**20世纪60年代和70年代的"第二次女权运动"**的参与者明白，在一个由男性主导的社会中实现平等, 还有很多工作要做。所以，*#第一次女权运动的主要推动力, 是争取"投票权"，而第二次女权运动, 则关注女性面临的社会问题和不平等现象，包括教育、婚姻法和职业发展。#* +

在法国，西蒙娜·德·波伏娃（Simone de Beauvoir）的著作《第二性》（The Second Sex）为女权主义理想奠定了基础。在这本书中，她认为那些约束女性行为的社会标准, 应该被废除，女性应该拥有和男性一样的每一个机会。她的作品成为了第二次女权运动的哲学基础。 +

然而，在东方 —— 更具体地说，在苏联阵营和苏联 —— 女性获得权利, 不是通过女权主义者的鼓动，而是更直接地通过政府政策。早在俄国革命时期，女性就被认为与男性平等，而且在许多方面，她们比西方任何地方的女性都有更多平等的机会。然而，苏联国家的女性也面临着和西方女性类似的许多问题。 +

20世纪女性角色的另一场变革, 与她们在婚姻和生育方面的权利有关。例如，离婚法律开始改变，给予女性在离婚过程中的一些主动权，而在此之前，离婚几乎完全由丈夫掌控。此外，女性对生育孩子的数量，或者是否要孩子，有了更多的控制权。 +

在这方面，可能最重大的变化是避孕药的出现。这项新技术在很大程度上是美国女权主义者玛格丽特·桑格（Margaret Sanger）努力的结果，她投入了大量资金来研发这种药物。从本质上讲，这是一种女性可以服用的药物，它调节女性的荷尔蒙，使她们怀孕的几率大大降低，而且当她们想要怀孕时，只要停止服用这种药物就可以。 +

在女性认为这是对自己身体的一种深刻的新自由时，主要的反对声音来自罗马天主教会（the Roman Catholic Church）。按照他们的观点，是上帝掌控着生育权，引入这样一种药物，将这种权力从上帝手中夺走，就是在扮演上帝。 +

沿着这些方面出现的另一项技术, 是**"体外受精"（in vitro fertilization）。这是一种将卵子在子宫外受精，然后再植入女性子宫的方法。**是的，这为那些不能自然怀孕的夫妇, 提供了一种生育孩子的新选择。但更重要的是，这意味着女性可以在不被一个总是要求她做三明治（指传统上对女性的刻板要求）的男人束缚的情况下怀孕。 +

最后，我们需要谈谈20世纪后期, 女性在政治方面取得的进步。其中最著名的可能是**玛格丽特·撒切尔**（Margaret Thatcher），她在1979年成为**英国的首位女首相。**她是一位强硬的保守派，*她的目标是推翻"自由工党"（the Liberal Labour Party）的政策，几十年来这些政策正把英国变成一个福利国家。她削减了政府项目，为富人降低了税收，并将许多国营机构私有化。* +

然后在**1990年，玛丽·罗宾逊（Mary Robinson）成为爱尔兰的首位女总统，**她利用总统的权力使爱尔兰实现现代化 —— 也就是说，她致力于将许多文化禁忌合法化，比如离婚、避孕和同性恋。 +

接着在**1991年，法国的首位女总理上台，**她就是社会党人埃迪特·克勒松（Édith Cresson）。**她的角色不像我提到的前两位女性那样备受赞誉，因为她的任期内一直受到腐败指控的困扰。**但是，嘿，几个世纪以来男性也一直被指控腐败，所以，你懂的，这也是一种平等。 +
