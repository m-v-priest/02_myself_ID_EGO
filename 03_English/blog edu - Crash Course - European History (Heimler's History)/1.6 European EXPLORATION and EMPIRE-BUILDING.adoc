== 释义

So eventually, Europeans 欧洲人 *went out* all over the world *establishing colonies* and *building empires* from 1450 to 1648, and in this video /we're going to consider why they did it /and how they did it.  +
So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then let's get to it. +

First, why did Europeans go out in this age of exploration *to conquer lands* and *set up empires*? Well, the classic answer is this: they did it for gold, for God, and for glory.  +
So first let's talk about gold as a motivating factor 激励因素 for exploration.  You know, silver was in there too, but you know the point is they went out exploring because they wanted wealth 财富. Boom 繁荣；增长. Shut up, gorilla. +

Anyway, in order to understand this motivation, you have to know about something called mercantilism 重商主义, which was _the dominant 占主导地位的；占优势的；首要的 economic system_ of Europe during this time period.  +
The _controlling idea_ 主旨思想 behind mercantilism is that /it *saw* the world's wealth *as* a pie, and that has two implications 含义；暗示；可能的影响. First, there's only a fixed 固定的；不变的 amount of pie.  +
Therefore, second, if I want a bigger slice of that pie, that means somebody else has to get a smaller slice of that pie.  +
And that makes sense 有意义,有道理/ when you realize that they measured (v.) wealth in terms of 就……而言 gold and silver, and of course there's only a finite 有限的 amount of gold and silver in the world. +

And so `主` _the goal of mercantilism_ then `系` was to get *as much* gold and silver into the national coffers 国库；金库 *as possible*.  +
So in order to do that, states had to maintain (v.) what was known as a favorable 有利的；有益的；赞同的；肯定的 balance of trade 贸易平衡, and *that meant (v.) that* a state needed to have more exports than imports.  +
And it's easy to understand why. If a state is importing (v.) a lot of goods, then where is that gold going? It's going out of the state. But if the state is *exporting* (v.) a lot of goods *to* other places, then where is the gold going? It's coming into the state. +

Now what does this *have to do with* 与…有关系 European exploration 这和欧洲的勘探有什么关系呢? Well, to put it _in proper academic historical terms_ 恰当的学术历史术语, a metric 米制的，公制的 buttload （非正式）一大堆，大量.  +
During this period, European states began to recognize (v.) that `主` establishing colonies `系`  was a sure means 确定的方法；可靠的手段 to getting more gold.  +
Not only did colonies themselves have deposits 矿床；储存；储蓄 of gold and silver, but they also provided raw materials 原材料 which could *be shipped (v.) back to* the imperial 帝国的；皇帝（或女皇）的；至高无上的；专横的 state, made into goods, and *sold* (v.) right *back to* the colonial 殖民地的；殖民的；拥有殖民地的 people.  +
And if they're selling (v.) goods to the colonial peoples, what's coming back into the country? Any guesses? Yes, that's right -- it's gold. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.a metric buttload
"buttload"​​ 是一个非正式（甚至有点粗俗）的俚语，表示 ​​“极大量”​​（a huge amount）。 +
原意： +
"butt" 在古英语中曾指 ​​“大木桶”​​（barrel），比如装酒或液体的容器。 +
"a buttload" 字面意思是 ​​“一大桶的量”​​，后来演变为夸张的 ​​“超级多”​​。 +
"metric"​​（公制的）是故意加上的修饰词，让这个俚语显得更夸张、更“科学化”（幽默效果）。 +
类似中文说 ​​“天文数字”​​ 或 ​​“多到爆炸”​​。 +

直译：​​“用专业的学术历史术语来说，就是‘公制巨量’。”​​ +
实际含义：作者用 ​​夸张幽默​​ 的方式表示 ​​“欧洲殖民掠夺的黄金数量极其庞大”​​。

So the point is, mercantilism 重商主义 was a major motivating factor for European exploration.  +

And if you want an example of this -- and I know that you do -- then let me introduce you to my boy _Jean-Baptiste Colbert_ (法国国王路易十四时期的财政大臣，被认为是重商主义的奠基人之一), who was France's _controller 管理员；主计长 general_ 总审计长 and kind 种类 of the poster child 典型人物；样板；模范 for mercantilist 重商主义的policy.  +
Colbert aimed (v.) *to create (v.) policies* in France 后定 that enabled (v.) French industry *to create (v.) everything* the people needed /so they didn't have to import (v.) those goods from elsewhere.  +
And in order to do that, he abolished (v.)废除；废止 domestic 国内的；本国的；家庭的；家用的；驯养的 tariffs 关税 /and *enacted* (v.)制定（法律）；通过（法案）steep (a.)过高的；过分的；急剧的；陡峭的 tariffs *on* other imported goods.  +
If you're *scratching (v.)抓挠 your head* 迷惑不解；绞尽脑汁 wondering (v.) what a tariff is, it's just a tax on _imported (a.) goods_. +

So Colbert *raised (v.) taxes* on _imported goods_ like a madman 疯子，狂人；精神病患者, and that means (v.) the French people will be more likely to buy (v.) French-made goods since they were cheaper.  +
Additionally, under Colbert's guidance 指导，指引, France claimed (v.)宣称对…拥有所有权；要求；声称；断言 _a bunch (束，串，扎；一伙，一群；) 大量；大批 of_ territory 领土；版图；领域；地盘 in North America -- `主` the most significant 重要的，意义重大的 of which `系` was Quebec and the Louisiana territory. +

Now briefly, `主` the other thing we need to talk about _under the heading 标题，题目 of gold_ `系` is the European demand (v.) for luxury 奢侈的；豪华的；奢华的 goods from Asia.
Elite 精英；上层人士；出类拔萃的人 Europeans had a craving 渴望；热望；迫切需求 for eastern porcelain (n.a.)瓷器 and spice 香料 and tea.  +
The problem was that the Muslim Ottoman Empire controlled (v.) the land routes /over which those luxury goods would travel into Europe.
Therefore, the prices of those goods were exceedingly 极其；非常；过度地 inflated (a.)使通货膨胀；使物价上涨；夸大；吹嘘.  +
That became a motivation for European states to try to find (v.) a sea route to Asia /so that they could trade (v.) in that market on their own terms 按照他们自己的条件；根据他们自己的主张. +

Okay, now the second motivation for European exploration was God. And it's hard to overestimate (v.)高估；对…估计过高 just _how much influence_ the Catholic Church -- and the later Protestant 新教徒的 Church -- had over European states.

[.my2]
天主教会和后来的新教教会, 对欧洲国家的影响, 是怎么估计都不为过的。

Their culture and their faith were bound 约束；限制；使结合；使黏合；捆绑 *so* tightly together /*that* it was difficult to tell where *one stopped* (v.) and *the others started.* And so *that made* (v.) `主` _certain states `谓` want *to spread* (v.) Christianity *into* distant lands._ +

[.my2]
他们的文化和信仰是如此紧密地联系在一起，以至于很难分辨出其中一个停止了，另一个开始了。这使得一些国家想把基督教传播到遥远的地方。

Case in point 一个典型、相关或相关的案例: Spain. So by 1492, they had completed the Reconquista 收复失地运动 /in which they were able to drive (v.) Jews and Muslims from their land.  +
And by the time of _the Protestant Reformation_ 新教改革, there was a desire to see Catholicism 天主教；天主教义 *in the ascendant 占优势的；占支配地位的；蒸蒸日上的；日益强大的 position* over Protestantism 新教；新教教义；新教徒. And that provided a motivation for _the exploration via the sea_ 海上探险.  +
And as *they found their way* to the New World, they *sent* (v.) Jesuit 耶稣会会士 missionaries (n.) 传教士 *to convert* (v.)使转变；使改变信仰；使皈依；改建；改造 indigenous 本土的；当地的；土著的；土生土长的 people. +

But you should know that /many of them *thought of* the indigenous 本土的，固有的 people *as* lesser 较少的；次要的；更小的 humans /and thus suitable 适宜的，合适的 for forced labor.  +
That way, Christianity became _an instrument_ 工具；手段；器械；促成某事的人 for control (n.) and subjugation (n.)征服；镇压；克制；抑制 _in the hands of_  由某人控制或拥有 imperial 帝国的，皇帝的 states.

But not all Jesuits 耶稣会成员  *held that belief*.  +
For example, Jesuit priest 牧师  _Bartolomé de las Casas_ mounted (v.)骑上；乘上；跨上;准备；安排；组织开展 elaborate (a.)详尽的；精心制作的；精美的；复杂的 defenses *on behalf of* American Indians /and worked *to make their life* under the imperial regime 政权；政体；统治；治理 *less harsh* 残酷的；严厉的；严酷的；恶劣的-- a sympathy 同情；同情心；赞同；支持；意气相投；志同道合 后定 that he did not hold (v.) for _the enslaved African people 后定 that would show up 显露，显示 later_ 他对后来被奴役的非洲人民没有同情心. But we'll talk about that in another video. +

All right, third motivation for exploration: glory.  +
The idea here is that /European states were *in competition with* 与……竞争 one another in terms of power.
And once _the establishment of empires_ became the scoreboard (n.)记分牌；计分器 for state power, European states tried to grab (v.) *as* many of those points *as possible*. +

Okay, now `主` these empires 后定 that were born out of European exploration `系` were a new kind of empire -- namely _maritime 海洋的；海事的；海运的；海员的 empire_.
And that just means (v.) they were sea-based and not land-based, as *so many empires* in world history *had been* _up to this moment_ 到目前为止.  +
If you're going to build a sea-based empire, you're going to need new technology.  +

And so let's talk about a few of the big _tech advancements_ 科技进步 during this period. +

First were advancements (n.)进步；进展 in cartography 制图学；绘图法；地图绘制-- _which is to say_ 换句话说, 意即 map-making 制图.  +
Up to this point, maps -- especially for navigating (v.)导航；确定方向；引导；指引 the sea -- were kind of vague (a.)模糊的；不清楚的；含糊的；不明确的 and in some cases inaccurate 不准确的；不准确；不精确；错误的.  +
But by this period, maps were becoming far more detailed 详尽的，详细的 and accurate, and *thanks to* the printing press 印刷机, becoming widely accessible 可到达的；可接近的；可进入的；可使用的. +

[.my2]
并且由于印刷机的存在，地图变得更加容易获取。

Second were new kinds of ships. For example, the Spanish and the Portuguese developed (v.) the caravel 轻快帆船,卡拉维尔帆船, which was very fast and highly navigable 可航行的；可通航的;适于航行的.  +
*Prior to this* 在此之前, ships kind of did like double duty 船只有点像双重职责 -- like they could *carry (v.) cargo* 货物；货运；货运列车 but they also had to be able to *be converted into* warships 军舰；战舰；战船 as well. *That meant that* they didn't do either particularly well.

[.my2]
在此之前，船只有点像双重职责——比如它们可以运载货物，但它们也必须能够改装成军舰。这意味着他们两项都做得不是特别好。

But the caravel *was made (v.) only for* shipping and trade -- although they, you know, could be armed (v.), but that wasn't their purpose.  And these ships were fast /because of new sail technology -- namely _the lateen (a.)大三角帆的；有大三帆的 sail_ (n.帆)三角帆. This was _a triangular 三角形的；三角的 sail_ that could *take on wind* from any side 它可以承受来自任何方向的风, not just from the back like _a square sail_ 方帆. +

Third were more accurate (a.) navigational 导航的；航行的；航海的 instruments 仪器；器具；器械；促成某事的人. For example, Europeans adopted (v.) _the magnetic 磁的；磁性的；磁石的；磁铁的 compass_ 指南针；罗盘 and the astrolabe 星盘 from Muslim and Chinese navigators.  +
The compass helped sailors to keep (v.) their direction true, while the astrolabe 星盘；天体观测仪 helped give an accurate reckoning 计算；估算；估计 of latitude 纬度. +

== 中文释义

所以最终，**从1450年到1648年，欧洲人走遍世界各地，建立殖民地，构建帝国。**在本视频中，我们将探讨他们这样做的原因和方式。所以，如果你准备好获取知识，那就开始吧。  +

那么首先，*##为什么欧洲人在这个探索时代，要去征服土地、建立帝国呢？经典的答案是：他们为了黄金（gold）、为了上帝（god）、为了荣耀（glory）##而这样做。*  +

首先，我们来谈谈作为探索动机之一的黄金。你知道，白银也在其中，但重点是，**他们出去探索是因为想要财富。**总之，为了理解这一动机，你必须了解一种叫做**"#重商主义#"**（mercantilism）的东西，*#它是这个时期欧洲占主导地位的经济(思想)体系。重商主义背后的核心观点是，它将世界财富视为一个馅饼(蛋糕)，这有两层含义。第一，馅饼的总量是固定的；因此，第二，如果我想要更大的一块馅饼，那就意味着其他人必须得到更小的一块(即零和博弈. 只分蛋糕, 不做大蛋糕)。当你意识到他们是以黄金和白银来衡量财富，而世界上的黄金和白银数量当然是有限的，这就说得通了。所以，重商主义的目标, 就是尽可能多地将黄金和白银纳入本国金库。#*  +

**#为了实现这一目标，各国必须保持所谓的"贸易顺差"（favorable balance of trade），这意味着一个国家的出口(外面的钱进入自己的口袋), 要多于进口(钱从自己的口袋流出, 进入别人的口袋)。#**原因很容易理解，*#如果一个国家大量进口商品，那么本国黄金就会流向国外；但如果这个国家向其他地方大量出口商品，那么黄金就会从外国流入本国内。#*  +

这与欧洲的探索有什么关系呢？用恰当的"学术历史术语"来说，在这个时期，**#欧洲各国开始认识到，建立殖民地, 是获取更多黄金的可靠途径。殖民地本身不仅有黄金和白银储量，还提供原材料，这些原材料可以运回宗主国，制成商品，再卖回给殖民地人民。如果他们向殖民地人民出售商品，那么什么会回流到国内呢？猜猜看，没错，是用来支付的货币(黄金)。#**所以，"重商主义"是欧洲探索的一个主要动机。

如果你想要一个例子，我知道你想，那让我给你介绍一下让 - 巴蒂斯特·柯尔贝尔（Jean Baptiste Colbert），他是法国的财政总监，也算是**"重商主义政策"的典型代表。**柯尔贝尔旨**在法国制定政策，#使法国工业能够生产人民所需的一切，这样他们就不必从其他地方进口这些商品(完全内循环, 在本国建立完整的各行产业链)。为了实现这一目标，他废除了国内关税，并对其他进口商品, 征收高额关税。#**如果你挠头想知道关税（tariff）是什么，它就是对进口商品征收的税。*所以柯尔贝尔像疯子一样提高进口商品的税收，这意味着法国人民因外国进口产品的价格更高, 而更有可能转而购买法国制造的商品，因为它们更便宜。*  +

此外，在柯尔贝尔的指导下，*法国在北美占领了大片领土，其中最重要的是魁北克（Quebec）和路易斯安那（Louisiana）地区。*  +

关于黄金这一**动机，我们还需要简要提及的, 是欧洲对亚洲奢侈品的需求。欧洲的精英阶层渴望东方的瓷器、香料和茶叶。问题是，##穆斯林"奥斯曼帝国"控制着这些奢侈品运往欧洲的陆路通道(存在中间商)，因此这些商品的价格大幅上涨。这就成为了欧洲各国试图寻找通往亚洲的海上航线的一个动机，这样他们就可以(绕过中间商, 直接找源头厂家,)##按照自己的条件,在那个市场进行贸易。**  +

**欧洲探索的第二个动机是"上帝"。**很难高估"天主教会", 以及后来的"新教"教会, 对欧洲各国的影响。他们的文化和信仰紧密相连，很难区分彼此的界限。*这使得某些国家想要将基督教传播到遥远的土地上，西班牙（Spain）就是一个典型例子。*  +

到1492年，他们完成了"收复失地运动"（Reconquista），将犹太人和穆斯林驱逐出他们的土地。**##到了"新教改革"时期，人们希望看到天主教相对于"新教"占据优势地位，这为海上探索提供了动力。##当他们抵达新大陆时，他们派遣"耶稣会"传教士（Jesuit missionaries）去使原住民皈依基督教。但你应该知道，他们中的许多人认为原住民是低等人类，因此适合从事强迫劳动。这样一来，基督教在帝国手中成为了控制和征服的工具。**但并非所有耶稣会士都持有这种观点，例如，耶稣会牧师巴托洛梅·德拉斯·卡萨斯（Bartolome de las Casas）为美洲印第安人进行了详尽的辩护，并努力减轻他们在帝国统治下的苦难。不过，他对后来出现的被奴役的非洲人却没有这种同情心，我们将在另一视频中讨论这个问题。  +

*探索的第三个动机是"荣耀"。这里的想法是，#欧洲各国在权力方面相互竞争，一旦"建立帝国"成为衡量"国家权力"的标准，欧洲各国就试图尽可能多地获取这些 “分数” (抱负, 好胜心, 不甘落后. 犹如中国觉得自己一定要打败美国)。#*  +

**这些源于欧洲探索而诞生的帝国, 是一种新型帝国，即海洋帝国（maritime empire），这意味着它们以海洋为基础，而不是像世界历史上许多帝国那样以陆地为基础。**如果你要建立一个海洋帝国，你就需要新技术。所以，我们来谈谈这个时期的一些重大技术进步。  +

首先是制图学（cartography）的进步，也就是地图绘制。在此之前，地图，尤其是用于海上导航的地图，有些模糊，在某些情况下还不准确。但到了这个时期，地图变得更加详细和准确，而且由于印刷机的出现，地图也变得更加普及。  +

其次是"新型船只"的出现。例如，*西班牙和葡萄牙开发了"卡拉维尔帆船"（caravel），这种船速度很快，且适航性很高。##在此之前，船只往往承担双重任务，它们既能运载货物，又能改装成战船。这意味着它们在这两方面都做得不是特别好。但"卡拉维尔帆船"专门用于航运和贸易，##尽管它们也可以配备武器，但这不是它们的主要用途。这些船速度快是因为采用了新的帆技术，即拉丁帆（Latin sail）。这是一种##"三角帆"，可以从任何方向迎风，而不像"方帆"那样只能从后面迎风。##*  +

第三是更精确的导航仪器。例如，欧洲人从穆斯林和中国航海家那里, 采用了磁罗盘（magnetic compass）和星盘（astrolabe）。罗盘帮助水手保持正确的方向，而**星盘则有助于准确计算纬度。**  +

综上所述，这些就是欧洲人开始海上探索, 并建立"海洋帝国"的方式和原因。现在，点击这里继续观看第一单元的更多视频，因为所有内容都在那里。如果你还需要更多帮助，那就点击这里获取我的完整的美国大学预修课程欧洲历史复习指南，它将帮助你在课堂上取得 A，并在五月份的考试中获得 5 分。回头见，海姆勒（Heimler）下线了。  +

So eventually, Europeans went out all over the world establishing colonies and building empires from 1450 to 1648, and in this video we're going to consider why they did it and how they did it. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then let's get to it.

First, why did Europeans go out in this age of exploration to conquer lands and set up empires? Well, the classic answer is this: they did it for gold, for God, and for glory. So first let's talk about gold as a motivating factor for exploration. You know, silver was in there too, but you know the point is they went out exploring because they wanted wealth. Boom. Shut up, gorilla.

Anyway, in order to understand this motivation, you have to know about something called mercantilism, which was the dominant economic system of Europe during this time period. The controlling idea behind mercantilism is that it saw the world's wealth as a pie, and that has two implications. First, there's only a fixed amount of pie. Therefore, second, if I want a bigger slice of that pie, that means somebody else has to get a smaller slice of that pie. And that makes sense when you realize that they measured wealth in terms of gold and silver, and of course there's only a finite amount of gold and silver in the world.

And so the goal of mercantilism then was to get as much gold and silver into the national coffers as possible. So in order to do that, states had to maintain what was known as a favorable balance of trade, and that meant that a state needed to have more exports than imports. And it's easy to understand why. If a state is importing a lot of goods, then where is that gold going? It's going out of the state. But if the state is exporting a lot of goods to other places, then where is the gold going? It's coming into the state.

Now what does this have to do with European exploration? Well, to put it in proper academic historical terms, a metric buttload. During this period, European states began to recognize that establishing colonies was a sure means to getting more gold. Not only did colonies themselves have deposits of gold and silver, but they also provided raw materials which could be shipped back to the imperial state, made into goods, and sold right back to the colonial people. And if they're selling goods to the colonial peoples, what's coming back into the country? Any guesses? Yes, that's right -- it's gold.

So the point is, mercantilism was a major motivating factor for European exploration. And if you want an example of this -- and I know that you do -- then let me introduce you to my boy Jean-Baptiste Colbert, who was France's controller general and kind of the poster child for mercantilist policy. Colbert aimed to create policies in France that enabled French industry to create everything the people needed so they didn't have to import those goods from elsewhere. And in order to do that, he abolished domestic tariffs and enacted steep tariffs on other imported goods. If you're scratching your head wondering what a tariff is, it's just a tax on imported goods.

So Colbert raised taxes on imported goods like a madman, and that means the French people will be more likely to buy French-made goods since they were cheaper. Additionally, under Colbert's guidance, France claimed a bunch of territory in North America -- the most significant of which was Quebec and the Louisiana territory.

Now briefly, the other thing we need to talk about under the heading of gold is the European demand for luxury goods from Asia. Elite Europeans had a craving for eastern porcelain and spice and tea. The problem was that the Muslim Ottoman Empire controlled the land routes over which those luxury goods would travel into Europe. Therefore, the prices of those goods were exceedingly inflated. That became a motivation for European states to try to find a sea route to Asia so that they could trade in that market on their own terms.

Okay, now the second motivation for European exploration was God. And it's hard to overestimate just how much influence the Catholic Church -- and the later Protestant Church -- had over European states. Their culture and their faith were bound so tightly together that it was difficult to tell where one stopped and the others started. And so that made certain states want to spread Christianity into distant lands.

Case in point: Spain. So by 1492, they had completed the Reconquista in which they were able to drive Jews and Muslims from their land. And by the time of the Protestant Reformation, there was a desire to see Catholicism in the ascendant position over Protestantism. And that provided a motivation for the exploration via the sea. And as they found their way to the New World, they sent Jesuit missionaries to convert indigenous people.

But you should know that many of them thought of the indigenous people as lesser humans and thus suitable for forced labor. That way, Christianity became an instrument for control and subjugation in the hands of imperial states. But not all Jesuits held that belief. For example, Jesuit priest Bartolomé de las Casas mounted elaborate defenses on behalf of American Indians and worked to make their life under the imperial regime less harsh -- a sympathy that he did not hold for the enslaved African people that would show up later. But we'll talk about that in another video.

All right, third motivation for exploration: glory. The idea here is that European states were in competition with one another in terms of power. And once the establishment of empires became the scoreboard for state power, European states tried to grab as many of those points as possible.

Okay, now these empires that were born out of European exploration were a new kind of empire -- namely maritime empire. And that just means they were sea-based and not land-based, as so many empires in world history had been up to this moment. If you're going to build a sea-based empire, you're going to need new technology. And so let's talk about a few of the big tech advancements during this period.

First were advancements in cartography -- which is to say map-making. Up to this point, maps -- especially for navigating the sea -- were kind of vague and in some cases inaccurate. But by this period, maps were becoming far more detailed and accurate, and thanks to the printing press, becoming widely accessible.

Second were new kinds of ships. For example, the Spanish and the Portuguese developed the caravel, which was very fast and highly navigable. Prior to this, ships kind of did like double duty -- like they could carry cargo but they also had to be able to be converted into warships as well. That meant that they didn't do either particularly well. But the caravel was made only for shipping and trade -- although they, you know, could be armed, but that wasn't their purpose. And these ships were fast because of new sail technology -- namely the lateen sail. This was a triangular sail that could take on wind from any side, not just from the back like a square sail.

Third were more accurate navigational instruments. For example, Europeans adopted the magnetic compass and the astrolabe from Muslim and Chinese navigators. The compass helped sailors to keep their direction true, while the astrolabe helped give an accurate reckoning of latitude.

So all of that put together is how and why Europeans began exploring via the sea and establishing maritime empires.
