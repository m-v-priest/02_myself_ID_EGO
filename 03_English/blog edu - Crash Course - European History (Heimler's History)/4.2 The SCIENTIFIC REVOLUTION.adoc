== 释义

If you were a European before the 1500s, you wouldn't believe some wonky 古怪的；离奇的 things about the world. You would believe that the Earth was the center of the universe, and that a full quarter of the human body was made of mucus 黏液. But now that we're beginning Unit Four, we're gonna see how all of that began to change in something called the Scientific Revolution 科学革命. If you want notes to follow along with 跟随；伴随 this video, then get your clicky finger out and check the link in the description. If you're ready to get them brain cows milked Copernican Revolution style （幽默表达，以哥白尼革命的方式获取知识）, then let's get to it. +

Now prior to 在……之前 the Scientific Revolution, much of the accepted knowledge 公认的知识 about the natural world came from ancient Greece, and more specifically Aristotle 亚里士多德. He taught that the Earth was at the center of the universe, which was further surrounded by concentric crystal spheres 同心水晶球 into which were embedded 嵌入 other planets and stars. The Catholic Church 天主教会 gave this cosmology 宇宙论 a thumbs up （习语，表示认可；赞同）because it squared nicely with 与……相符 the creation account 创世记载 in Genesis 1《创世纪》第一章. So for about two thousand years, this is how Europeans understood the world. +

So where did the Scientific Revolution come from? Well, there are many roots 根源, but I'm only going to give you three of the most significant 重要的. First was the establishment of universities 大学的建立 during the medieval times 中世纪. Thanks to Islamic scholars 伊斯兰学者 who had preserved 保存 and amended 修改 Aristotelian texts 亚里士多德的著作, Greek scholarship 希腊学术 became the foundation of medieval university curriculum 中世纪大学课程的基础. By the 14th and 15th centuries, however, European universities had established new departments of mathematics 数学 and astronomy 天文学. And so as these disciplines 学科 took their place alongside natural philosophy 自然哲学 -- which was the study of the natural world -- the stage was set for （习语，为……做好准备）new ways of thinking about the world. +

The second root was the Renaissance 文艺复兴. Recall 回想 all the way back to Unit One when we talked about the wealthy folks 富人 who patronized 赞助；资助 the arts. Well, they also patronized many studies into the natural world, and that makes sense given the Renaissance emphasis on realism 现实主义. The third root was, not surprisingly, the printing press 印刷术. New discoveries about the natural world were being made across the globe 全球各地. The printing press made it possible to circulate 传播 those new findings 新发现 with great speed 快速地 to a wide readership 广大读者群. With more people sitting around scratching their brains （习语，绞尽脑汁；苦思冥想）, there is going to be more opportunity for new ideas. +

So now let's talk about the Scientific Revolution in terms of 就……而言 astronomy 天文学. The first name you need to associate with 与……联系起来 this is Nicholas Copernicus 尼古拉·哥白尼. Remember that according to Aristotle and other Greek thinkers like Ptolemy 托勒密, the Earth was fixed 固定的 and immovable 不可移动的 in the center of the universe. Look, you can hardly blame them （习语，很难责怪他们）. That made a lot of sense out of （习语，理解；明白）what a person sees with their eyeballs when they look at the sky. It looks like the Earth is still 静止的 and the Moon and the Sun rotate around 围绕旋转. This is known as the geocentric model 地心说模型 of the universe. +

So then Copernicus came along and said, "You know, maybe we shouldn't come to conclusions 得出结论 only based on what our eyes see, and instead rely on 依靠 mathematics and see where that leads us." So Copernicus got down and dirty in his notebooks （习语，深入钻研）doing complex math 复杂的数学运算 which I couldn't even begin to describe to you, for alas （感叹词，表示遗憾、悲伤等）I am but a humble history teacher 卑微的历史老师. But regardless 无论如何, through his mathematical work, Copernicus challenged the geocentric view 地心说观点 of the universe. Instead, he put forth 提出 the heliocentric model 日心说模型 which said that the sun was at the center, and the Earth along with the other heavenly bodies 天体 on display in the sky revolved around the Sun 围绕太阳公转. Additionally, he was able to demonstrate 证明 that the reason it appears that the sun is rising and setting 日出日落 is because the Earth itself spins upon an axis 绕轴自转. +

And then building upon 基于 Copernicus's work, Johannes Kepler 约翰内斯·开普勒 created another massive breakthrough 重大突破. Again using mathematics, Kepler accepted the heliocentric model of the universe, but through detailed computations 详细的计算 established 确立 three laws of planetary motion 行星运动三大定律. First, he discovered that planets orbited the Sun not in perfect circles 正圆 but rather in ellipses 椭圆. Second, he demonstrated that planets move faster when they are closer to the Sun and slower when they're farther away 离太阳越近运动越快，越远越慢. And third, he figured out 弄清楚 that the time a planet takes to orbit the Sun is exactly related to its distance from the Sun 行星绕太阳公转的时间与它和太阳的距离密切相关. +

And then the third name you need to know under this heading 在这个主题下 is Galileo 伽利略. Now both Copernicus and Kepler came to their conclusions mainly by mapping them out with their thinky-thinky parts （幽默表达，通过思考）, but Galileo took these conclusions even further by taking the conclusions out of the brain and instead using his eyeballs （幽默表达，通过观察）. He built a new contraption 装置 called a telescope 望远镜 -- and you know he didn't invent it, but he did build his own -- and this allowed the human eye to see far greater distances into space 观测到更远的太空. And with the telescope, Galileo was able to observe in detail 详细观察 the moons of different planets 不同行星的卫星 and was able to prove that those other planets weren't celestial bodies of light 发光的天体 as had previously been believed, but rather they were made out of the same stuff as Earth 与地球由相同物质构成. And this experimental method 实验方法 was crucial 至关重要的 in overturning 推翻 the accepted truths 公认的真理 about the universe. +

Now it's important to emphasize 强调 again that as each of these men did their work, they were overturning previous assumptions 推翻以前的假设 about how the cosmos 宇宙 worked. And because the old Aristotelian view 亚里士多德的观点 lined up with 与……一致 the Bible -- and you know, by the way, "Aristotelian" 亚里士多德的 is just the adjective form of Aristotle -- the Catholic Church was not happy about these developments 发展. So in addition to 除了 challenging established philosophical authority 挑战已有的哲学权威, these scientists were challenging scriptural authority 圣经权威. Since much of this was going on during the Catholic Reformation 天主教改革, when the church was doing its best to clean up its profile 改善形象 in the eyes of Europeans, such challenges were untenable 站不住脚的. And so Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo ended up on the church's index of prohibited books 禁书目录, and even Galileo was tried for heresy 因异端邪说受审. +

However, by about 1640, the heliocentric model of the universe was pretty widely accepted by the scientific community 科学界, as well as the contributions of Kepler and Galileo 开普勒和伽利略的贡献. But what remained unexplained 未被解释的 is by what force all these heavenly bodies of the universe held together 维系在一起. For that, let me introduce you to my boy Isaac Newton 艾萨克·牛顿. Near the end of the 17th century, Newton was able to combine 结合 the physics of Galileo 伽利略的物理学 with the mathematical computations 数学计算 of Kepler and Copernicus to produce the law of universal gravitation 万有引力定律. It was a force called gravity 重力 that kept all the planets revolving in relation to one another 使所有行星相互环绕旋转. And gravity was directly proportional 成正比, he said, to the size and weight of the planetary objects in question 相关行星的大小和重量. It was Newton's theory of gravity 牛顿的引力理论 that defined 定义 the field of astronomy 天文学领域 until Albert Einstein came along 出现. But you know, we'll talk about that in another video. +

So this Scientific Revolution didn't just apply to 适用于 the realm of 领域 space and stars and planets. It was also applied to the study of the human body 人体研究. The same thing was happening here that happened with astronomy 天文学. Old Greek understandings of the body 古希腊对人体的认识 were being overturned 推翻 in favor of 支持；赞同 newer, more accurate understanding 新的、更准确的认识. Basically, it was the ancient Greek Galen 盖伦 whose theories about the human body dominated this field 主导这个领域. Galen argued for what he called the humoral theory of the body 体液学说, which said that the body was composed of 由……组成 four kinds of substances or humors 体液. Those four substances were blood 血液, yellow bile 黄胆汁, black bile 黑胆汁, and phlegm 黏液. Now I don't know enough about Galen to tell you why he thought that a quarter of the human body was composed of mucus, but you know, he did. +

Regardless 无论如何, according to Galen, when these four humors were in balance 平衡, the body was healthy, but when they got out of balance 失衡, that was the cause for sickness and disease 疾病的原因. But then along came some folks 人们 in this period to overturn Galen's ideas through experimentation and observation 实验和观察. First was the Swiss physician Paracelsus 帕拉塞尔苏斯, who rejected 摒弃 the humoral theory of disease 疾病的体液学说 and claimed that it was chemical imbalances 化学失衡 that caused disease. And if that was true, then chemical remedies 化学药物 could solve those imbalances 解决这些失衡问题. Like if someone was sick under Galen's care, then the go-to method 常用方法 of curing them was bloodletting 放血. "You're sick, which means your humors are out of balance, so let's get rid of some of your blood." Paracelsus said, "No, how about we let the patients keep their blood and give them chemical medicines to address their problems." +

And then came Andreas Vesalius 安德烈亚斯·维萨里, who contributed to the study of anatomy 解剖学研究 by dissecting 解剖 dead bodies by the hundreds 成百上千的尸体. He published his findings 研究成果 in a book and completely debunked 揭穿；驳斥 Galen's understanding of the body and revolutionized 彻底改变 the understanding of the human body. And finally, you need to know William Harvey 威廉·哈维. He further overturned Galen's ideas, this time about circulation 血液循环. Galen taught that there were two different systems of blood contained in the body 体内有两套不同的血液系统, and they did not interact with one another 互不流通. But Harvey, through experimentation 实验, discovered that the circulatory system 循环系统 was one integrated whole 一个完整的整体. Blood is pumped out of the heart 心脏泵血 through the body and returns to the heart to do the whole thing over again 流回心脏循环往复. +

And finally, the Scientific Revolution included a revolution in the way people reasoned 推理方式. First, let me introduce you to Francis Bacon 弗朗西斯·培根. His major contribution to the thinky-thinky world 思想领域 was an emphasis on empiricism 经验主义, which when being defined 定义为 is the pursuit of knowledge through inductive reasoning 归纳推理 -- which when being defined means understanding the world first by observing the smallest parts of it 观察最小的部分 and then generalizing 归纳 those findings to the largest part 最大的部分. Then there was René Descartes 勒内·笛卡尔, who developed a system of deductive reasoning 演绎推理体系. This came about 产生 because of the revolution in astronomy 天文学革命. The geocentric conception 观念 of the universe seemed good because it aligned with 与……一致 what a person could see, but then mathematics came along and undermined 削弱 the senses 感官认知. So Descartes figured 认为 it was necessary to doubt everything that could reasonably be doubted 合理怀疑一切, and once you ran into something that was undoubtable 无可置疑的, then you could build your reasoning upon that first principle 第一原理. And then from those big ideas 大的概念, you could work your way down to the smaller ideas 小的概念. Either way, both of these men were the first major players 重要人物 in challenging the dominance of ancient Greek philosophy 挑战古希腊哲学的主导地位. +

However, despite these massive innovations 重大创新 in how humans understood their world and the world beyond them, older beliefs 旧观念 continued to persist 持续存在. Some of these pathfinders 开拓者 of the new science still held on to 坚持 beliefs in alchemy 炼金术, which was the attempt to turn base metals 贱金属 into gold and silver 金银, and astrology 占星术, which taught that the position of planets and stars affected the outcome of human life 行星和恒星的位置影响人类生活的结果. For example, while Johannes Kepler was busy blowing our minds （习语，让我们大为惊讶）with the scientific laws of planetary motion 行星运动科学定律, he was also a court mathematician 宫廷数学家 whose duties included printing out horoscopes 打印占星图 for the day. So you know, it wasn't all changed. There were some significant continuities 延续性 as well. +

== 中文释义

如果你生活在16世纪之前的欧洲，你会相信一些关于世界的奇怪说法。你会认为地球是宇宙的中心，并且人体的四分之一是由黏液组成的。但现在我们开始学习第四单元，我们将看到所有这些观念是如何在一场被称为科学革命的运动中开始改变的。如果你想要与这个视频配套的笔记，那就伸出你的手指点击描述中的链接。如果你准备好像哥白尼革命那样充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

在科学革命之前，关于自然世界的许多被接受的知识都来自古希腊，更具体地说，来自亚里士多德。他认为地球是宇宙的中心，地球周围环绕着同心水晶球，其他行星和恒星镶嵌其中。天主教会对这种宇宙观表示认可，因为它与《创世纪》第一章中的创世记载相符。所以在大约两千年的时间里，欧洲人就是这样理解世界的。  +

那么科学革命是怎么产生的呢？嗯，它有很多根源，但我只给你讲三个最重要的。首先是中世纪大学的建立。多亏了那些保存和修正亚里士多德著作的伊斯兰学者，希腊学术成为了中世纪大学课程的基础。然而，到了14和15世纪，欧洲的大学建立了新的数学和天文学系。所以，随着这些学科与自然哲学（即对自然世界的研究）并驾齐驱，为思考世界的新方式奠定了基础。  +

第二个根源是文艺复兴。回想一下第一单元，我们谈到了那些赞助艺术的富人。嗯，他们也赞助了许多对自然世界的研究，考虑到文艺复兴对现实主义的强调，这是有道理的。第三个根源，并不奇怪，是印刷机。世界各地都有关于自然世界的新发现。印刷机使得这些新发现能够迅速传播给广大读者。随着更多的人绞尽脑汁思考，产生新思想的机会也就更多了。  +

现在让我们从天文学的角度谈谈科学革命。你需要记住的第一个人是尼古拉·哥白尼（Nicholas Copernicus）。记住，根据亚里士多德和其他像托勒密这样的希腊思想家的观点，地球是固定不动地位于宇宙的中心。看，你不能责怪他们。从人们用眼睛观察天空的角度来看，这种观点很有道理。看起来地球是静止的，月亮和太阳围绕着它旋转。这就是所谓的宇宙地心说模型。  +

然后哥白尼出现了，他说：“你知道吗，也许我们不应该仅仅根据眼睛所看到的就下结论，而应该依靠数学，看看数学能把我们引向何方。”所以哥白尼在他的笔记本上努力钻研复杂的数学，这些数学我甚至无法向你描述，因为我只是一个谦逊的历史老师。但不管怎样，通过他的数学研究，哥白尼挑战了宇宙地心说观点。相反，他提出了日心说模型，认为太阳是宇宙的中心，地球和天空中其他天体都围绕太阳旋转。此外，他还证明了太阳看起来升起和落下的原因是地球本身在绕轴自转。  +

然后，约翰内斯·开普勒（Johannes Kepler）在哥白尼的工作基础上取得了另一个重大突破。开普勒同样运用数学，接受了宇宙日心说模型，但通过详细的计算，他确立了行星运动的三大定律。首先，他发现行星绕太阳的轨道不是完美的圆形，而是椭圆形。其次，他证明了行星离太阳越近运动得越快，离太阳越远运动得越慢。第三，他弄清楚了行星绕太阳公转的时间与它和太阳的距离精确相关。  +

在这个主题下你需要知道的第三个人是伽利略（Galileo）。哥白尼和开普勒得出结论主要是通过思考推理，但伽利略更进一步，不再仅仅依靠思考，而是运用他的眼睛进行观察。他制造了一个新装置，叫做望远镜（他并不是望远镜的发明者，但他制造了自己的望远镜），这使得人类的眼睛能够看到太空中更远的地方。有了望远镜，伽利略能够详细地观察不同行星的卫星，并且能够证明其他行星并不像以前认为的那样是发光的天体，而是和地球由相同的物质构成。这种实验方法对于推翻关于宇宙的公认真理至关重要。  +

现在要再次强调的是，当这些人进行他们的研究时，他们在推翻以前关于宇宙如何运行的假设。而且，由于古老的亚里士多德观点与《圣经》相符（顺便说一下，“Aristotelian”是亚里士多德的形容词形式），天主教会对这些发展并不满意。所以，除了挑战已有的哲学权威之外，这些科学家还在挑战《圣经》的权威。由于这一切大多发生在天主教改革时期，当时教会正尽力改善它在欧洲人眼中的形象，这样的挑战是站不住脚的。所以哥白尼、开普勒和伽利略的著作最终被列入了教会的禁书目录，甚至伽利略还因异端邪说而受审。  +

然而，到了大约1640年，宇宙日心说模型在科学界被广泛接受，开普勒和伽利略的贡献也是如此。但仍有一个问题没有得到解释，那就是是什么力量让宇宙中的所有天体维系在一起。为此，让我给你介绍艾萨克·牛顿（Isaac Newton）。在17世纪末，牛顿能够将伽利略的物理学与开普勒和哥白尼的数学计算结合起来，提出了万有引力定律。他说，有一种叫做引力的力量使所有行星相互环绕。并且引力与所涉及的行星物体的大小和重量成正比。在阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦（Albert Einstein）出现之前，牛顿的引力理论定义了天文学领域。但我们会在另一个视频中谈到这一点。  +

所以这场科学革命不仅仅适用于太空、恒星和行星领域。它也应用于对人体的研究。在这里发生的事情和天文学领域类似。古希腊人对人体的旧有理解被推翻，取而代之的是更新、更准确的理解。基本上，是古希腊的盖伦（Galen）关于人体的理论在这个领域占据主导地位。盖伦提出了他所谓的人体体液理论，他认为人体由四种物质或体液组成。这四种物质是血液、黄胆汁、黑胆汁和黏液。我对盖伦的理论了解得不够多，无法告诉你他为什么认为人体的四分之一是由黏液组成的，但他就是这么认为的。  +

不管怎样，根据盖伦的理论，当这四种体液平衡时，身体是健康的，但当它们失衡时，疾病就产生了。但在这个时期，一些人通过实验和观察推翻了盖伦的观点。第一个是瑞士医生帕拉塞尔苏斯（Paracelsus），他拒绝接受疾病的体液理论，声称疾病是由化学失衡引起的。如果这是真的，那么化学药物可以解决这些失衡问题。比如，如果一个人在盖伦的理论下生病，当时的治疗方法是放血。“你生病了，这意味着你的体液失衡了，所以我们放掉一些你的血吧。”帕拉塞尔苏斯说：“不，我们为什么不让病人保留他们的血液，而是给他们化学药物来解决问题呢。”  +

然后是安德烈亚斯·维萨里（Andreas Vesalius），他通过解剖数百具尸体为解剖学研究做出了贡献。他在一本书中发表了他的发现，彻底推翻了盖伦对人体的理解，革新了对人体的认识。最后，你需要了解威廉·哈维（William Harvey）。他进一步推翻了盖伦的观点，这次是关于血液循环的观点。盖伦认为人体内有两种不同的血液系统，它们彼此不相互作用。但哈维通过实验发现，循环系统是一个完整的整体。血液从心脏被泵出，流经身体，然后再回到心脏，循环往复。  +

最后，科学革命还包括人们推理方式的革命。首先，让我给你介绍弗朗西斯·培根（Francis Bacon）。他对思想世界的主要贡献是强调经验主义，经验主义被定义为通过归纳推理来追求知识——归纳推理的定义是先通过观察事物的最小部分来理解世界，然后将这些发现推广到更大的范围。然后是勒内·笛卡尔（René Descartes），他发展出了演绎推理系统。这是由于天文学的革命而产生的。宇宙地心说概念看起来不错，因为它与人们所能看到的相符，但后来数学的发展削弱了感官的作用。所以笛卡尔认为有必要怀疑一切合理的事物，一旦你遇到了不可怀疑的事物，你就可以基于这个第一原则进行推理。然后从这些大的理念出发，你可以推导出较小的理念。不管怎样，这两个人是挑战古希腊哲学主导地位的主要先驱者。  +

然而，尽管人类对自己的世界以及世界之外的理解有了这些重大创新，旧有的信仰仍然存在。一些新科学的开拓者仍然相信炼金术（试图将贱金属变成黄金和白银）和占星术（认为行星和恒星的位置会影响人类生活的结果）。例如，当约翰内斯·开普勒忙于用行星运动的科学定律让我们惊叹时，他也是一位宫廷数学家，他的职责包括印制当天的星象图。所以，并不是所有的一切都改变了，也有一些显著的延续性。  +

If you were a European before the 1500s, you wouldn't believe some wonky things about the world. You would believe that the Earth was the center of the universe, and that a full quarter of the human body was made of mucus. But now that we're beginning Unit Four, we're gonna see how all of that began to change in something called the Scientific Revolution. If you want notes to follow along with this video, then get your clicky finger out and check the link in the description. If you're ready to get them brain cows milked Copernican Revolution style, then let's get to it.

Now prior to the Scientific Revolution, much of the accepted knowledge about the natural world came from ancient Greece, and more specifically Aristotle. He taught that the Earth was at the center of the universe, which was further surrounded by concentric crystal spheres into which were embedded other planets and stars. The Catholic Church gave this cosmology a thumbs up because it squared nicely with the creation account in Genesis 1. So for about two thousand years, this is how Europeans understood the world.

So where did the Scientific Revolution come from? Well, there are many roots, but I'm only going to give you three of the most significant. First was the establishment of universities during the medieval times. Thanks to Islamic scholars who had preserved and amended Aristotelian texts, Greek scholarship became the foundation of medieval university curriculum. By the 14th and 15th centuries, however, European universities had established new departments of mathematics and astronomy. And so as these disciplines took their place alongside natural philosophy -- which was the study of the natural world -- the stage was set for new ways of thinking about the world.

The second root was the Renaissance. Recall all the way back to Unit One when we talked about the wealthy folks who patronized the arts. Well, they also patronized many studies into the natural world, and that makes sense given the Renaissance emphasis on realism. The third root was, not surprisingly, the printing press. New discoveries about the natural world were being made across the globe. The printing press made it possible to circulate those new findings with great speed to a wide readership. With more people sitting around scratching their brains, there is going to be more opportunity for new ideas.

So now let's talk about the Scientific Revolution in terms of astronomy. The first name you need to associate with this is Nicholas Copernicus. Remember that according to Aristotle and other Greek thinkers like Ptolemy, the Earth was fixed and immovable in the center of the universe. Look, you can hardly blame them. That made a lot of sense out of what a person sees with their eyeballs when they look at the sky. It looks like the Earth is still and the Moon and the Sun rotate around. This is known as the geocentric model of the universe.

So then Copernicus came along and said, "You know, maybe we shouldn't come to conclusions only based on what our eyes see, and instead rely on mathematics and see where that leads us." So Copernicus got down and dirty in his notebooks doing complex math which I couldn't even begin to describe to you, for alas I am but a humble history teacher. But regardless, through his mathematical work, Copernicus challenged the geocentric view of the universe. Instead, he put forth the heliocentric model which said that the sun was at the center, and the Earth along with the other heavenly bodies on display in the sky revolved around the Sun. Additionally, he was able to demonstrate that the reason it appears that the sun is rising and setting is because the Earth itself spins upon an axis.

And then building upon Copernicus's work, Johannes Kepler created another massive breakthrough. Again using mathematics, Kepler accepted the heliocentric model of the universe, but through detailed computations established three laws of planetary motion. First, he discovered that planets orbited the Sun not in perfect circles but rather in ellipses. Second, he demonstrated that planets move faster when they are closer to the Sun and slower when they're farther away. And third, he figured out that the time a planet takes to orbit the Sun is exactly related to its distance from the Sun.

And then the third name you need to know under this heading is Galileo. Now both Copernicus and Kepler came to their conclusions mainly by mapping them out with their thinky-thinky parts, but Galileo took these conclusions even further by taking the conclusions out of the brain and instead using his eyeballs. He built a new contraption called a telescope -- and you know he didn't invent it, but he did build his own -- and this allowed the human eye to see far greater distances into space. And with the telescope, Galileo was able to observe in detail the moons of different planets and was able to prove that those other planets weren't celestial bodies of light as had previously been believed, but rather they were made out of the same stuff as Earth. And this experimental method was crucial in overturning the accepted truths about the universe.

Now it's important to emphasize again that as each of these men did their work, they were overturning previous assumptions about how the cosmos worked. And because the old Aristotelian view lined up with the Bible -- and you know, by the way, "Aristotelian" is just the adjective form of Aristotle -- the Catholic Church was not happy about these developments. So in addition to challenging established philosophical authority, these scientists were challenging scriptural authority. Since much of this was going on during the Catholic Reformation, when the church was doing its best to clean up its profile in the eyes of Europeans, such challenges were untenable. And so Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo ended up on the church's index of prohibited books, and even Galileo was tried for heresy.

However, by about 1640, the heliocentric model of the universe was pretty widely accepted by the scientific community, as well as the contributions of Kepler and Galileo. But what remained unexplained is by what force all these heavenly bodies of the universe held together. For that, let me introduce you to my boy Isaac Newton. Near the end of the 17th century, Newton was able to combine the physics of Galileo with the mathematical computations of Kepler and Copernicus to produce the law of universal gravitation. It was a force called gravity that kept all the planets revolving in relation to one another. And gravity was directly proportional, he said, to the size and weight of the planetary objects in question. It was Newton's theory of gravity that defined the field of astronomy until Albert Einstein came along. But you know, we'll talk about that in another video.

So this Scientific Revolution didn't just apply to the realm of space and stars and planets. It was also applied to the study of the human body. The same thing was happening here that happened with astronomy. Old Greek understandings of the body were being overturned in favor of newer, more accurate understanding. Basically, it was the ancient Greek Galen whose theories about the human body dominated this field. Galen argued for what he called the humoral theory of the body, which said that the body was composed of four kinds of substances or humors. Those four substances were blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm. Now I don't know enough about Galen to tell you why he thought that a quarter of the human body was composed of mucus, but you know, he did.

Regardless, according to Galen, when these four humors were in balance, the body was healthy, but when they got out of balance, that was the cause for sickness and disease. But then along came some folks in this period to overturn Galen's ideas through experimentation and observation. First was the Swiss physician Paracelsus, who rejected the humoral theory of disease and claimed that it was chemical imbalances that caused disease. And if that was true, then chemical remedies could solve those imbalances. Like if someone was sick under Galen's care, then the go-to method of curing them was bloodletting. "You're sick, which means your humors are out of balance, so let's get rid of some of your blood." Paracelsus said, "No, how about we let the patients keep their blood and give them chemical medicines to address their problems."

And then came Andreas Vesalius, who contributed to the study of anatomy by dissecting dead bodies by the hundreds. He published his findings in a book and completely debunked Galen's understanding of the body and revolutionized the understanding of the human body. And finally, you need to know William Harvey. He further overturned Galen's ideas, this time about circulation. Galen taught that there were two different systems of blood contained in the body, and they did not interact with one another. But Harvey, through experimentation, discovered that the circulatory system was one integrated whole. Blood is pumped out of the heart through the body and returns to the heart to do the whole thing over again.

And finally, the Scientific Revolution included a revolution in the way people reasoned. First, let me introduce you to Francis Bacon. His major contribution to the thinky-thinky world was an emphasis on empiricism, which when being defined is the pursuit of knowledge through inductive reasoning -- which when being defined means understanding the world first by observing the smallest parts of it and then generalizing those findings to the largest part. Then there was René Descartes, who developed a system of deductive reasoning. This came about because of the revolution in astronomy. The geocentric conception of the universe seemed good because it aligned with what a person could see, but then mathematics came along and undermined the senses. So Descartes figured it was necessary to doubt everything that could reasonably be doubted, and once you ran into something that was undoubtable, then you could build your reasoning upon that first principle. And then from those big ideas, you could work your way down to the smaller ideas. Either way, both of these men were the first major players in challenging the dominance of ancient Greek philosophy.

However, despite these massive innovations in how humans understood their world and the world beyond them, older beliefs continued to persist. Some of these pathfinders of the new science still held on to beliefs in alchemy, which was the attempt to turn base metals into gold and silver, and astrology, which taught that the position of planets and stars affected the outcome of human life. For example, while Johannes Kepler was busy blowing our minds with the scientific laws of planetary motion, he was also a court mathematician whose duties included printing out horoscopes for the day. So you know, it wasn't all changed. There were some significant continuities as well.
