Okay, now in 1517, Martin Luther 马丁·路德 nailed his 95 Theses 95条论纲 to the Wittenberg door 维滕贝格教堂大门, starting the Protestant Reformation 新教改革 and cracking the facade 打破表象 of a unified European church 统一的欧洲教会. And the Catholics were... uh... none too pleased about 对……不太满意 the Protestants. About 30 years after the Protestant Reformation started, the Catholics started rethinking things. I mean, don't get me wrong -- Protestants are still dumb -- but you know, maybe some of their complaints are valid 有道理的. So in this video, we're going to look at what the Catholics did in response to 回应 these Protestant complaints. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

So in response to Protestant complaints against the Catholic Church, the Catholics underwent 经历 their own reformation, and it's known as the Catholic Reformation 天主教改革, or sometimes you'll hear it called the Counter Reformation 反宗教改革 or the Catholic Counter Reformation. You know, same thing. So now the Protestants were clearly gaining ground 取得进展 in Europe, and maybe more importantly, gaining power 获得权力. How would the Catholic Church respond? +

Well, one of the first initiatives 举措 was the establishment of the Jesuit order 耶稣会. This was a group established by Ignatius of Loyola 依纳爵·罗耀拉 whose purpose was to educate the church. They established some of the finest educational institutions 教育机构 across Europe on the assumption that 如果 Catholics were better able to use their thinky-thinking parts, they would be less likely to fall prey to 受……影响 Protestant doctrine 教义. The Jesuits were also responsible for the Roman Inquisition 罗马宗教裁判所, which was established to root out 根除 heretics 异教徒 among the church. And by "root out," I mean... well... anyway. The Inquisition was responsible for creating the Index of Prohibited Books 禁书目录, which is exactly what it sounds like. It was a list of all the books that the church said were forbidden 禁止的 for Catholics to read. Not surprisingly, all the Protestant reformers made it on the list, as did folks like Galileo 伽利略 and even Erasmus 伊拉斯谟. +

And there were other orders established as well. The Jesuits were all dudes （俚语，男人）, but the Ursulines 乌尔苏拉会, who were a female order 女性修会, had much the same purpose. Like the Jesuits, they focused on educating Catholics, especially young girls. And like the Jesuits, the Ursulines had a missionary impulse 传教冲动 to carry the teachings of Christ throughout the world in missionary effort 传教活动. Then came Saint Teresa of Avila 阿维拉的圣特蕾莎, who reformed the Carmelite Order 加尔默罗会 of the church. Under Teresa's leadership, the Carmelites rejected the affluence 富裕 that had corrupted 腐蚀 the church and adopted a life of prayer and poverty 祈祷和清贫的生活. +

So you can see that the Catholic Church is busy cleaning up its own house 整顿内部事务 with the establishment of new religious orders 宗教修会. But probably the most significant manifestation 表现形式 of the Catholic Reformation was the Council of Trent 特伦托会议, whose goal was to resolve the differences 解决分歧 between Protestants and Catholics. Now let's remind ourselves of some of the complaints that the Protestants leveled against 对……提出批评 the Catholic Church. They complained about the practice of simony 买卖圣职, which was the buying and selling of church offices 教会职位. They complained about the immorality 不道德 of priests and bishops 主教. And most of all, Protestants complained about the sale of indulgences 赎罪券, which people bought to secure the forgiveness of their sins 确保罪得赦免 and, on the flip side 另一方面, which also financed 资助 church building projects. +

So by 1545, Pope Paul III 教皇保罗三世 called the Council of Trent to address 处理 these issues. This council met intermittently 断断续续地 until 1563, and the council took a hard look at 认真审视 the church and made a few significant decisions. First, they suppressed 禁止 the practice of simony. Second, they reestablished 重新确立 the celibacy 独身 of the priesthood 神职人员. And third, they cleaned up the practice of the sale of indulgences. They didn't say indulgences could not be sold, but they did say that they couldn't be sold to pay for the Pope's beach house. So at this point, you know, it's looking like the Catholics and the Protestants are on the same page 达成共识, and I'm sure a healing of this great rift 裂痕 is at hand 即将到来. Yeah, no. +

In addition to 除……之外 cleaning up these corrupt practices 腐败行为, the Council of Trent also reaffirmed 重申 traditional Catholic doctrine 天主教传统教义. They affirmed that salvation 救赎 comes by faith and works 信仰和行为, not just faith like the Protestants claim. They affirmed the doctrine of transubstantiation 圣体圣事教义, which said that the bread and wine served in the mass 弥撒中的饼和酒 actually became the flesh and blood of Christ 耶稣的身体和血, which the Protestants denied 否认. They affirmed the seven sacraments 七大圣礼 of the church, whereas the Protestants only affirm two. They affirmed the equal authority 平等权威 of the Bible and church dogma 教会教义, whereas the Protestants only believed in the ultimate authority 最终权威 of the Bible alone. +

So with these affirmations of the Council of Trent, that giant ecclesiastical 教会的 hug Catholics and Protestants were about to give each other was torn apart 撕裂. And so would the Council of Trent. The split 分裂 between the Catholics and the Protestants was made permanent 永久化. +

== 中文释义

好的，在1517年，马丁·路德（Martin Luther）将他的《九十五条论纲》（95 Theses）钉在了维滕贝格（Wittenberg）教堂的门上，开启了"新教改革"（Protestant Reformation），打破了欧洲统一教会的表象。而天主教徒们……呃……对新教徒们可太不满意了。**在"新教改革"开始大约30年后，**天主教徒们开始重新思考一些事情。我的意思是，别误会——新教徒们还是很“傻”——但你知道的，也许他们的一些抱怨是合理的。所以在这个视频里，我们要看看天主教徒们是如何回应新教徒们的抱怨的。所以，如果你准备好获取知识，那我们开始吧。  +

所以，**为了回应新教徒对天主教会（Catholic Church）的批判，天主教徒们进行了他们自己的改革，**这被称为天主教改革（Catholic Reformation），有时你也会听到**它被叫做"反宗教改革"**（Counter Reformation）或"天主教反宗教改革"（Catholic Counter Reformation）。你知道的，都是一回事。所以现在新教徒们在欧洲明显地扩大了影响力，而且更重要的是，获得了权力。天主教会会如何回应呢？  +

嗯，首先采取的**行动之一是建立"耶稣会"**（Jesuit order）。这是由依纳爵·罗耀拉（Ignatius of Loyola）建立的一个团体，**其目的是对教会进行教育。**他们在欧洲建立了一些最优秀的教育机构，**他们认为如果天主教徒能更好地运用他们的思考能力，就不太可能成为"新教教义"的追随者(即将强天主教"意识形态教育", 抵御新教思想)。**耶稣会还负责**建立"罗马宗教裁判所"（Roman Inquisition），其目的是清除教会中的异教徒。**而我说的“清除”，我的意思是……嗯……不管怎样。宗教裁判所负责**制定《禁书目录》**（Index of Prohibited Books），听名字就知道是干什么的。这是一份教会规定"天主教徒"禁止阅读的所有书籍的清单。*毫不奇怪，所有的"新教改革者"都在这份清单上，像伽利略（Galileo）甚至伊拉斯谟（Erasmus）这样的人也在上面。*  +

此外还建立了其他修会。耶稣会的成员都是男性，但**乌尔苏拉会（Ursulines）是一个女性修会，**有着大致相同的目的。和耶稣会一样，他们专注于教育天主教徒，尤其是年轻女孩。**和耶稣会一样，乌尔苏拉会也有传教的冲动，努力将基督的教义传播到世界各地。**然后是阿维拉的圣特蕾莎（Saint Teresa of Avila），她改革了教会的加尔默罗会（Carmelite Order）。在特蕾莎的领导下，加尔默罗会摒弃了腐蚀教会的财富，选择了祈祷和贫穷的生活。  +

所以你可以看到，天主教会通过建立新的"宗教修会", 来忙着整顿自身。但天主教改革最显著的表现, 可能是"特伦托会议"（Council of Trent），其目标是解决"新教徒"和"天主教徒"之间的分歧。现在让我们回想一下新教徒对天主教会提出的一些抱怨。他们抱怨"买卖神职"（simony）的行为，也就是买卖教会职位。他们抱怨牧师和主教的不道德行为。最重要的是，新教徒抱怨买卖"赎罪券"（indulgences）的行为，人们购买"赎罪券"来确保自己的罪行得到宽恕，另一方面，这也为教会的建筑项目提供了资金。  +

所以在1545年，教皇保罗三世（Pope Paul III）召集了"特伦托会议"来处理这些问题。这个会议断断续续地开到1563年，会议对教会进行了严格审查，并做出了一些重要决定。首先，**他们抑制了买卖神职的行为。**其次，他们**重申了神职人员的独身制度**（celibacy of the priesthood）。第三，他们**整顿了买卖赎罪券的行为。他们没有说"不能买卖赎罪券"，但他们表示赎罪券不能用来支付教皇的海滨别墅费用。**所以在这一点上，你知道的，看起来天主教徒和新教徒达成了一致，但我敢肯定，这场巨大的裂痕并没有得到弥合。是的，并没有。  +

除了整顿这些腐败行为，特伦托会议还:

- **重申了传统的天主教教义。他们确认救赎是通过"信仰"和"善行"实现的(即意志和行动都要有)，而不是像新教徒声称的那样仅靠信仰(不靠行动)。**
- 他们确认了圣体圣事（transubstantiation）的教义，即弥撒中使用的面包和葡萄酒, 实际上变成了基督的肉和血，而新教徒们是不承认这一点的。
- 他们确认了教会的"七大圣礼"（seven sacraments），而新教徒只承认其中的两项。
- *他们确认了《圣经》和教会教义的平等权威，而新教徒只相信《圣经》的最终权威。*  +

所以，随着特伦托会议的这些确认，天主教徒和新教徒之间本可能的和解被彻底撕裂了。特伦托会议也未能让双方弥合分歧。天主教徒和新教徒之间的分裂成了永久性的。  +
