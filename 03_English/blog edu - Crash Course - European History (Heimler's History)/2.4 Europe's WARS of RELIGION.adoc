The last couple of videos we've been talking about the Protestant Reformation 新教改革, but you didn't think all the religious change in Europe wasn't gonna cause Christians to start killing each other in the name of Jesus, did you? Don't be crazy. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then let's talk about Europe's Wars of Religion 欧洲宗教战争. +

I reckon 认为 we ought to start in France. So in the first half of the 1500s, most of the French people were Catholic, but by the 1560s Protestantism 新教 had spread into France -- thanks printing press 印刷机 -- and gained a pretty strong foothold 立足点. Now the particular flavor of Protestantism that had taken root 扎根 in France was Calvinism 加尔文主义, and French Calvinists 法国加尔文主义者 were known as Huguenots 胡格诺派. Now this wouldn't have posed 造成 much of a problem except that something like half of the French nobility 法国贵族 were now Huguenot, and they started agitating for 鼓动；争取 recognition and rights within France. But the Catholic majority 天主教多数派 were in no mood to 无意；没心情 do so, and that is when Charles IX 查理九世 took the throne 登上王位. +

He was a wee lad 小男孩 coming in at 11 years old, so his mother Catherine de Medici 凯瑟琳·德·美第奇 essentially 实际上 ruled in his place until he came of age 成年. Now Catherine was very Catholic, and she was pretty saucy 大胆的 about these French noble Huguenots demanding recognition and rights, so she decided that she wanted to purge 清除 France of this cranky non-conforming nobility -- not least because 尤其是因为 they were a threat to her power. And so the French Wars of Religion began in 1562 with an event known as the Massacre of Vassy 瓦西大屠杀. Essentially 实质上 a group of Huguenots were at a worship service 礼拜仪式, you know, just minding their own business 自顾自地做事 and singing to Jesus, when a duke of the Catholic Guise family 天主教吉斯家族的公爵 ordered them all killed. +

Now the Huguenots were not a strong enough force to take over France at this point, but they fought defensively 防御性地 for 10 years and held their own 坚守阵地 until the next massacre orchestrated 策划 by Catherine de Medici -- namely 即 the Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre 圣巴托洛缪之夜大屠杀. At this point it's 1572, and all the religious tensions 宗教紧张局势 seemed to be solved in the marriage of the Catholic sister of Charles IX and the Calvinist Henry of Navarre 纳瓦拉的亨利. Now because Henry was the kind of de facto 事实上的 leader of the Huguenots, many of them came to Paris for the wedding. Big mistake. The Guise family -- who, if you will remember, were responsible for the Huguenot massacre of Vassy -- convinced Catherine de Medici that all these filthy Calvinists were a threat to Catholic France. So under her influence, Charles IX went ahead and ordered the mass killing 大屠杀 of these Huguenots, and that unleashed 引发 a three-day killing spree 三天的杀戮狂欢 in which Catholics slaughtered 屠杀 thousands of Huguenots throughout Paris. +

Now Henry of Navarre, the champion 领袖 of the Huguenots, their leader, went ahead and saved his own life by promising to convert to Catholicism 改信天主教. I admire your cowardice 懦弱. But don't worry -- he showed true moral fortitude 道德勇气 by converting back to Calvinism just in time for the next phase of France's Wars of Religion: the War of the Three Henrys 三亨利之战. Now class, how many Henrys do you think were involved in this war? Three? That is correct. +

So as the religious and political tension continued to build, three different Henrys vied for 争夺 the throne of France. By 1574, Henry III 亨利三世 was on the throne having succeeded 继承 Charles IX, but apparently he was not Catholic enough for Henry of Guise 吉斯的亨利, who was the leader of the ultra-Catholic Holy League 极端天主教神圣联盟 and wanted to assume the throne 登上王位 himself. So Henry of Guise, with the help of the Spanish throne 西班牙王室, took the French throne by force 武力夺取, relegating 贬谪 Henry III to his chief minister 首席大臣. As a result of that, Henry III had Henry of Guise assassinated 暗杀 and then joined Henry of Navarre to rid Paris of the Holy League 清除巴黎的神圣联盟. And he did it. But in 1589, a disgruntled 不满的 monk assassinated Henry III, and that left Henry of Navarre to take the throne. +

Now remember -- he had converted back to Calvinism, but he understood that such an arrangement 安排 would be none too popular 不太受欢迎, and so he went ahead and converted back to Catholicism. Man doesn't know principles 原则. Regardless 不管怎样, by the time of his ascension 登基 in 1594 as Henry IV 亨利四世, the French Wars of Religion had come to an end. One of Henry the Fourth's major achievements was the move towards religious toleration 宗教宽容 in France, embodied in 体现在 the Edict of Nantes 南特敕令 in 1598. It officially established France as a Catholic state but also provided the Huguenots freedom to worship without the fear that they will be massacred 屠杀 or otherwise harassed 骚扰. +

But my dear pupils 学生, religious wars were not just occurring in France. Spain was a major player 主要参与者 too. Now Spain was ruled by the Habsburgs 哈布斯堡家族, who have been in power 掌权 across Europe for a very long time, and Spain was as Catholic as Catholic can be 非常天主教的. Now by the time Philip the Second 腓力二世 rose to power 掌权 in 1556, Spain was having some Ottoman Empire 奥斯曼帝国 trouble. In 1453, the Ottomans had completed their conquest of 征服 the Byzantine Empire 拜占庭帝国 by capturing its crown jewel 瑰宝 Constantinople 君士坦丁堡, and with that victory the Ottomans decided that the next best thing to do would be to expand into 扩张到 central and eastern Europe. So Spain, with the help of the king of Poland and the duke of Lorraine 洛林公爵, repelled 击退 the Ottoman forces 奥斯曼军队, and that put the kibosh on 阻止 the Ottoman expansion into Europe. +

Now Philip II 腓力二世 was pretty upset about the fracturing 分裂 of Christianity across Europe, and it's hard to overestimate 高估 just how much he hated Protestants. He decided that he wanted to restore Catholic unity 恢复天主教统一 across Europe, and he set his sights on 把目标对准 the Netherlands 荷兰 and England to rid them of 摆脱 their filthy Protestant influence. In the Netherlands, there was a growing Calvinist contingent 加尔文主义者群体, especially in the middle class 中产阶级. Now Philip's dad Charles V 查理五世 was relatively tolerant of 相对宽容 this group and he let them do their thing, but not Philip. When Dutch Calvinists began destroying Catholic religious images -- and the word for that is iconoclasm 破坏圣像运动 -- Philip II unleashed targeted persecution 针对性迫害 on them. +

So William of Orange 奥兰治的威廉 rose to the leadership of the Dutch Calvinists, and in 1581 they declared themselves independent of Spanish rule 宣布脱离西班牙统治. Now Spain also had England problems. By this point, Elizabeth the First 伊丽莎白一世 was on the throne and she was all about the Protestantism 支持新教. She supported the Dutch Protestant rebellion 荷兰新教起义 that I just mentioned, and to that Philip of Spain said, "No no you didn't." So because of that, and because England had been messing with 骚扰 Spain's merchant ships 商船, Philip sent the Spanish Armada 西班牙无敌舰队 to invade England and teach them a lesson 给他们一个教训. But as it turns out 结果是, the English navy gave the Spanish Armada a smackdown 击败, and that victory combined with the Dutch Protestant rebellion meant that Protestantism was gaining a foothold in Europe. +

Now the last religious war you need to know might be the most significant, and it was called the Thirty Years' War 三十年战争, and it occurred in the Holy Roman Empire 神圣罗马帝国. Now in order to understand this, you have to understand the Peace of Augsburg 奥格斯堡和约 of 1555, which offered some degree of religious toleration 宗教宽容 in the Holy Roman Empire. This document decreed 颁布；命令 that the princes 诸侯 of the many territories 领土 of the Holy Roman Empire could decide whether their subjects 臣民 would be Catholic or Protestant. But -- and here's the problem -- when I say Protestant, I mean Lutheran 路德宗的. Now as you no doubt know by now, Calvinism and Lutheranism were separate but related strains 流派 of Protestantism, and Calvinism was exerting 施加 some major influence in the Holy Roman Empire. But since the Peace of Augsburg had only two options -- Catholic or Lutheran -- in the Holy Roman Empire, the Calvinists were like, "Yeah, that ain't gonna work." +

So when Catholic Ferdinand 天主教徒斐迪南 became king in the Calvinist territory of Bohemia 波希米亚的加尔文主义地区, things started getting saucy 混乱的. As Ferdinand started a program of re-Catholicizing Bohemia 使波希米亚重新天主教化, the Calvinist nobility 加尔文主义贵族 were like, "Nope." And to emphasize their point, the nobility threw two of Ferdinand's messengers out a window in an event known as the Defenestration of Prague 布拉格扔出窗外事件 -- defenestration 扔出窗外 being a fancy word for throwing someone out a window. Now these officials fell something like 70 feet and survived. Catholics said they survived because of the intercession 祈祷；调解 of the Virgin Mary 圣母玛利亚. Protestants pointed out that their fall was broken by a giant pile of manure 粪堆. Now whether it was Mary's intercession or the poo, I'm not qualified to answer, but this event set off 引发 the Thirty Years' War. +

Now there are four phases 阶段 of this war you need to know, and that can be confusing, but the big idea to notice here is that as we go through the phases -- like as we move from phase one to phase four -- the motivations for fighting go from being primarily religious to primarily political 从主要是宗教原因转变为主要是政治原因. +

So phase one: the Bohemian phase 波希米亚阶段. In this phase, the Holy Roman Emperor 神圣罗马帝国皇帝 and Catholic Ferdinand II 斐迪南二世 defeated Protestant forces led by Frederick the First 腓特烈一世 at the Battle of White Mountain 白山战役. The result of this phase is that the Catholics gain the upper hand 占上风 and re-establish Catholicism across many places in the Holy Roman Empire. +

Then came phase two, namely the Danish phase 丹麦阶段. In this phase, King Christian IV of Denmark 丹麦国王克里斯蒂安四世 -- you know, that's the Danish part -- he took up the Protestant cause 支持新教事业, not least because he was involved in an anti-Catholic, anti-Habsburg alliance 反天主教、反哈布斯堡联盟 with England. You can see here the political motive 政治动机 starting to bleed in 逐渐显现. Now despite this help on the Protestant side, the Catholics still won this phase of the war. +

And then came phase three: the Swedish phase 瑞典阶段. In this phase, the war begins to extend beyond the borders of the Holy Roman Empire, and King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden 瑞典国王古斯塔夫·阿道夫 organizes the Protestant cause and armies and scores a major victory for the Protestants. Now one reason the Protestants fared so well 表现出色 is because Gustavus Adolphus was a military genius 军事天才, but the other reason is because the Protestants received no small financial help 大量经济援助 from France. Wait a minute -- if I remember correctly from the beginning of this video, France was Catholic. So what in the fresh heck are they doing financing the Protestant struggle against the Catholics? Well, this is the major turning point 重大转折点 where we can see that the religious character 宗教性质 of the war has clearly taken a back seat to 退居次要地位 political concern 政治考量. You see, the only thing the Catholic French leadership hated more than Protestants was the Habsburgs, and so they didn't care that the Protestants were fighting against them -- they just wanted to weaken the Habsburg influence. +

Anyway, the fourth and final phase of the war was the French phase 法国阶段, and here France entered into the war on the side of the Protestants and fought mainly with Spain to assure that the Habsburgs would not rebound from 从……恢复 their defeats. And in 1648, the Thirty Years' War finally came to an end with the signing of the Peace of Westphalia 威斯特伐利亚和约. And there are a couple of things you need to know about this major turning point in European history. +

First, it essentially marked the end of the religious wars of Europe. Second, it amended 修订 the Peace of Augsburg to include Calvinism as a legitimate faith 合法宗教. Third, with that further splintering 进一步分裂 of Protestantism, it officially marked the end of the medieval idea of a universal Christendom 普世基督教世界的中世纪观念. And fourth, it kept the Holy Roman Empire weak and the rulers of individual states strong, and in that way it hastened the decline of 加速……的衰落 the Holy Roman Empire. +

== 中文释义

在过去的几个视频里，我们一直在谈论"新教改革"，但你不会以为欧洲的宗教变革, 不会导致基督徒以耶稣的名义相互残杀吧 (即宗教子派别纷争, 内部各派系争夺正统地位)，对不对？别天真了。所以，如果你准备好获取知识，那我们来谈谈欧洲的"宗教战争"吧。  +

我觉得我们应该从法国说起。在16世纪上半叶，大多数法国人都是天主教徒，但到了16世纪60年代，新教（Protestantism）借助印刷术传播到了法国，并获得了相当稳固的立足点。在法国扎根的新教是加尔文主义（Calvinism），**法国的加尔文主义者被称为"胡格诺派"（Huguenots）。**本来这不会成为什么大问题，除非大约一半的法国贵族成了胡格诺派，而且他们开始在法国争取认可和权利。但天主教徒占多数的群体, 可没心情答应他们的要求，就在这时，查理九世（Charles IX）登上了王位。  +

查理九世登基时还是个小孩子，所以在他成年之前，实际上是他的母亲凯瑟琳·德·美第奇（Catherine de Medici）在统治。凯瑟琳是个虔诚的天主教徒，她对那些要求认可和权利的法国"胡格诺派"贵族非常不满，所以她决定清除法国这些难以驯服、不服从的贵族——尤其是因为他们对她的权力构成了威胁。于是，法国宗教战争在1562年因一场被称为瓦西大屠杀（Massacre of Vassy）的事件而爆发。基本上，一群胡格诺派教徒正在进行礼拜仪式，自顾自地唱着赞美耶稣的歌，这时天主教吉斯家族（Catholic Guise family）的一位公爵下令把他们全部杀掉。  +

那时，胡格诺派的力量还不足以接管法国，但他们进行了10年的防御战，坚守阵地，直到凯瑟琳·德·美第奇策划了下一场大屠杀——也就是圣巴托洛缪大屠杀（Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre）。到了1572年，查理九世的天主教妹妹与加尔文主义者纳瓦拉的亨利（Henry of Navarre）结婚，所有的宗教紧张局势似乎得到了解决。因为亨利实际上是胡格诺派的领袖，许多胡格诺派教徒来到巴黎参加婚礼。这可是个大错误。吉斯家族——如果你还记得的话，他们就是制造瓦西大屠杀的罪魁祸首——说服凯瑟琳·德·美第奇，说这些讨厌的加尔文主义者对天主教的法国构成了威胁。所以在她的影响下，查理九世下令大规模屠杀这些胡格诺派教徒，这引发了一场为期三天的杀戮狂欢，天主教徒在巴黎各地屠杀了数千名胡格诺派教徒。  +

纳瓦拉的亨利，胡格诺派的领袖，为了保命，承诺皈依天主教。我真佩服他的懦弱。但别担心——他在法国宗教战争的下一阶段，也就是三亨利战争（War of the Three Henrys）时，又重新皈依了加尔文主义，展现出了真正的道德勇气。同学们，你们觉得这场战争涉及几个亨利呢？三个？答对了。  +

随着宗教和政治紧张局势不断加剧，三个不同的亨利争夺法国王位。到了1574年，亨利三世（Henry III）继承查理九世的王位，但显然他对吉斯的亨利（Henry of Guise）来说还不够虔诚，吉斯的亨利是极端天主教的神圣联盟（ultra-Catholic Holy League）的领袖，他想自己登上王位。所以吉斯的亨利在西班牙王位（Spanish throne）的帮助下，武力夺取了法国王位，把亨利三世降为他的首席大臣。结果，亨利三世派人暗杀了吉斯的亨利，然后与纳瓦拉的亨利一起把神圣联盟赶出了巴黎。他做到了。但在1589年，一个心怀不满的修道士暗杀了亨利三世，于是纳瓦拉的亨利登上了王位。  +

记住——他又皈依了加尔文主义，但他明白这种安排不会太受欢迎，所以他又皈依了天主教。这人毫无原则。不管怎样，1594年，亨利四世（Henry IV）登基时，法国宗教战争结束了。亨利四世的一项重大成就就是推动了法国的宗教宽容，这体现在**1598年的《南特敕令》（Edict of Nantes）中。它正式确立法国为天主教国家，但也给予胡格诺派自由礼拜的权利，**不用担心会被屠杀或受到其他骚扰。  +

但是，亲爱的同学们，宗教战争可不只发生在法国。西班牙也是其中的重要参与者。当时西班牙由哈布斯堡家族（Habsburgs）统治，他们在欧洲掌权已经很久了，而且**西班牙是个彻头彻尾的天主教国家。**1556年，腓力二世（Philip the Second）掌权时，西班牙遇到了奥斯曼帝国（Ottoman Empire）的麻烦。1453年，奥斯曼人通过占领拜占庭帝国（Byzantine Empire）的瑰宝君士坦丁堡（Constantinople）, 完成了对拜占庭帝国的征服，这场胜利让奥斯曼人决定下一步要向中欧和东欧扩张。所以西班牙在波兰国王（king of Poland）和洛林公爵（duke of Lorraine）的帮助下，击退了奥斯曼军队，阻止了奥斯曼帝国向欧洲的扩张。  +

**(西班牙)腓力二世对欧洲基督教的分裂非常不满，而且他对"新教徒"的厌恶程度怎么高估都不为过。他决定要恢复欧洲的天主教统一，他把目标对准了荷兰（Netherlands）和英国（England），**想要消除"新教徒"在那里的不良影响。**在荷兰，加尔文主义者的势力不断壮大，尤其是在中产阶级中。**腓力的父亲查理五世（Charles V）对这个群体相对宽容，允许他们做自己的事，但腓力可不会这样。当荷兰加尔文主义者开始破坏天主教的宗教形象时——这种行为被称为"反圣像运动"（iconoclasm）——腓力二世对他们进行了有针对性的迫害。  +

于是，**奥兰治的威廉（William of Orange）成为了荷兰加尔文主义者的领袖，1581年，他们宣布脱离西班牙的统治。**西班牙也和英国有矛盾。这时，**(英国)伊丽莎白一世（Elizabeth the First）在位，她支持"新教"。**她支持了我刚才提到的荷兰新教叛乱，对此，西班牙的腓力二世表示：“不行，你们不能这样。” 所以，因为这件事，**也因为英国一直在骚扰西班牙的商船，腓力派出西班牙无敌舰队（Spanish Armada）入侵英国，**想给他们一个教训。但结果是，*英国海军打败了西班牙无敌舰队，这场胜利，再加上荷兰新教叛乱，意味着"新教"在欧洲获得了立足点。*  +

最后一场你需要了解的**宗教战争, 可能是最重要的，它被称为三十年战争（Thirty Years' War），发生在神圣罗马帝国**（Holy Roman Empire）。为了理解这场战争，你必须了解**1555年的《奥格斯堡和约》（Peace of Augsburg），该和约在神圣罗马帝国给予了一定程度的宗教宽容。这份文件规定，神圣罗马帝国众多领土的王子们可以决定他们的臣民是天主教徒还是新教徒。但问题是——当我说新教徒时，我指的是路德派（Lutheran）。你们现在肯定知道，#加尔文主义（Calvinism）和路德主义（Lutheranism）是新教（Protestantism）中相互独立但又相关的流派，#**而且加尔文主义在神圣罗马帝国产生了重大影响。**#但由于《奥格斯堡和约》只提供了两个选择——天主教或路德派——在神圣罗马帝国，加尔文主义者会说：“这可不行。”# ** +

所以，当天主教徒斐迪南（Ferdinand）成为加尔文主义领地波希米亚（Bohemia）的国王时，事情变得棘手起来。斐迪南开始了波希米亚重新天主教化的计划，加尔文主义贵族们表示：“不行。” 为了强调他们的观点，贵族们把斐迪南的两名使者扔出了窗外，这一事件被称为"布拉格掷出窗外事件"（Defenestration of Prague）——“defenestration”是一个很花哨的词，意思是把人扔出窗外。这些官员从大约70英尺(≈ 21.3米)的高处摔下，却活了下来。天主教徒说他们能活下来是因为圣母玛利亚（Virgin Mary）的庇佑。新教徒则指出，是一大堆粪便缓冲了他们的坠落。不管是因为圣母的庇佑, 还是那堆粪便，我没有资格评判，但**这一事件引发了三十年战争。**  +

**这场战争有四个阶段，**你们需要了解，这可能会让人感到困惑，但需要注意的是，*随着战争从第一阶段发展到第四阶段，战争的动机, 从主要是宗教方面的, 转变为主要是政治方面的。*  +

第一阶段：波希米亚阶段。在这个阶段，神圣罗马帝国皇帝、天主教徒斐迪南二世（Ferdinand II）在白山战役（Battle of White Mountain）中击败了由弗雷德里克一世（Frederick the First）领导的"新教"势力。这个阶段的结果是，天主教徒占据了上风，并在神圣罗马帝国的许多地方, 重新确立了天主教的地位。  +

然后是第二阶段，也就是丹麦阶段。在这个阶段，丹麦国王克里斯蒂安四世（Christian IV）——这就是丹麦阶段的由来——他支持"新教"事业，尤其是因为他与英国结成了反天主教、反哈布斯堡的联盟。你可以看到，政治动机开始显现。尽管新教一方得到了帮助，但天主教徒还是赢得了战争的这个阶段。  +

接着是**第三阶段：**瑞典阶段。**在这个阶段，战争开始超出神圣罗马帝国的边界，**瑞典国王古斯塔夫·阿道夫（Gustavus Adolphus）组织了"新教"事业和军队，并为**"新教徒"取得了重大胜利。**新教徒表现出色的一个原因是古斯塔夫·阿道夫是个军事天才，但另**一个原因是"新教徒"得到了法国的大量财政援助。**等一下——如果我没记错的话，**法国是天主教国家。那么他们为什么要资助"新教徒"与天主教徒作战呢？**嗯，这是一个重大转折点，**我们可以看到，战争的"宗教性质"明显让位于"政治考量"。你看，天主教的法国领导层最讨厌的就是哈布斯堡家族，**所以他们不在乎新教徒与天主教徒作战——*他们只是想削弱哈布斯堡家族的影响力。*  +

不管怎样，战争的第四阶段也是最后阶段, 是法国阶段，在这个阶段，**法国站在"新教徒"一方参战，主要与西班牙作战，以确保哈布斯堡家族不会从失败中恢复过来。#1648年，三十年战争随着《威斯特伐利亚和约》（Peace of Westphalia）的签署最终结束。#**关于欧洲历史上的这个重大转折点，有几件事你们需要知道。  +

首先，*#它基本上标志着欧洲"宗教战争"的结束。其次，它修订了《奥格斯堡和约》，将"加尔文主义"(新教之一)列为合法的信仰。第三，随着"新教"的进一步分裂，它正式标志着中世纪"普世基督教世界观念"的终结。第四，它使"神圣罗马帝国"变得虚弱，而各个邦国的统治者变得强大，从这个意义上说，它加速了"神圣罗马帝国"的衰落。#*  +

The last couple of videos we've been talking about the Protestant Reformation, but you didn't think all the religious change in Europe wasn't gonna cause Christians to start killing each other in the name of Jesus, did you? Don't be crazy. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then let's talk about Europe's Wars of Religion.

I reckon we ought to start in France. So in the first half of the 1500s, most of the French people were Catholic, but by the 1560s Protestantism had spread into France -- thanks printing press -- and gained a pretty strong foothold. Now the particular flavor of Protestantism that had taken root in France was Calvinism, and French Calvinists were known as Huguenots. Now this wouldn't have posed much of a problem except that something like half of the French nobility were now Huguenot, and they started agitating for recognition and rights within France. But the Catholic majority were in no mood to do so, and that is when Charles IX took the throne.

He was a wee lad coming in at 11 years old, so his mother Catherine de Medici essentially ruled in his place until he came of age. Now Catherine was very Catholic, and she was pretty saucy about these French noble Huguenots demanding recognition and rights, so she decided that she wanted to purge France of this cranky non-conforming nobility -- not least because they were a threat to her power. And so the French Wars of Religion began in 1562 with an event known as the Massacre of Vassy. Essentially a group of Huguenots were at a worship service, you know, just minding their own business and singing to Jesus, when a duke of the Catholic Guise family ordered them all killed.

Now the Huguenots were not a strong enough force to take over France at this point, but they fought defensively for 10 years and held their own until the next massacre orchestrated by Catherine de Medici -- namely the Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre. At this point it's 1572, and all the religious tensions seemed to be solved in the marriage of the Catholic sister of Charles IX and the Calvinist Henry of Navarre. Now because Henry was the kind of de facto leader of the Huguenots, many of them came to Paris for the wedding. Big mistake. The Guise family -- who, if you will remember, were responsible for the Huguenot massacre of Vassy -- convinced Catherine de Medici that all these filthy Calvinists were a threat to Catholic France. So under her influence, Charles IX went ahead and ordered the mass killing of these Huguenots, and that unleashed a three-day killing spree in which Catholics slaughtered thousands of Huguenots throughout Paris.

Now Henry of Navarre, the champion of the Huguenots, their leader, went ahead and saved his own life by promising to convert to Catholicism. I admire your cowardice. But don't worry -- he showed true moral fortitude by converting back to Calvinism just in time for the next phase of France's Wars of Religion: the War of the Three Henrys. Now class, how many Henrys do you think were involved in this war? Three? That is correct.

So as the religious and political tension continued to build, three different Henrys vied for the throne of France. By 1574, Henry III was on the throne having succeeded Charles IX, but apparently he was not Catholic enough for Henry of Guise, who was the leader of the ultra-Catholic Holy League and wanted to assume the throne himself. So Henry of Guise, with the help of the Spanish throne, took the French throne by force, relegating Henry III to his chief minister. As a result of that, Henry III had Henry of Guise assassinated and then joined Henry of Navarre to rid Paris of the Holy League. And he did it. But in 1589, a disgruntled monk assassinated Henry III, and that left Henry of Navarre to take the throne.

Now remember -- he had converted back to Calvinism, but he understood that such an arrangement would be none too popular, and so he went ahead and converted back to Catholicism. Man doesn't know principles. Regardless, by the time of his ascension in 1594 as Henry IV, the French Wars of Religion had come to an end. One of Henry the Fourth's major achievements was the move towards religious toleration in France, embodied in the Edict of Nantes in 1598. It officially established France as a Catholic state but also provided the Huguenots freedom to worship without the fear that they will be massacred or otherwise harassed.

But my dear pupils, religious wars were not just occurring in France. Spain was a major player too. Now Spain was ruled by the Habsburgs, who have been in power across Europe for a very long time, and Spain was as Catholic as Catholic can be. Now by the time Philip the Second rose to power in 1556, Spain was having some Ottoman Empire trouble. In 1453, the Ottomans had completed their conquest of the Byzantine Empire by capturing its crown jewel Constantinople, and with that victory the Ottomans decided that the next best thing to do would be to expand into central and eastern Europe. So Spain, with the help of the king of Poland and the duke of Lorraine, repelled the Ottoman forces, and that put the kibosh on the Ottoman expansion into Europe.

Now Philip II was pretty upset about the fracturing of Christianity across Europe, and it's hard to overestimate just how much he hated Protestants. He decided that he wanted to restore Catholic unity across Europe, and he set his sights on the Netherlands and England to rid them of their filthy Protestant influence. In the Netherlands, there was a growing Calvinist contingent, especially in the middle class. Now Philip's dad Charles V was relatively tolerant of this group and he let them do their thing, but not Philip. When Dutch Calvinists began destroying Catholic religious images -- and the word for that is iconoclasm -- Philip II unleashed targeted persecution on them.

So William of Orange rose to the leadership of the Dutch Calvinists, and in 1581 they declared themselves independent of Spanish rule. Now Spain also had England problems. By this point, Elizabeth the First was on the throne and she was all about the Protestantism. She supported the Dutch Protestant rebellion that I just mentioned, and to that Philip of Spain said, "No no you didn't." So because of that, and because England had been messing with Spain's merchant ships, Philip sent the Spanish Armada to invade England and teach them a lesson. But as it turns out, the English navy gave the Spanish Armada a smackdown, and that victory combined with the Dutch Protestant rebellion meant that Protestantism was gaining a foothold in Europe.

Now the last religious war you need to know might be the most significant, and it was called the Thirty Years' War, and it occurred in the Holy Roman Empire. Now in order to understand this, you have to understand the Peace of Augsburg of 1555, which offered some degree of religious toleration in the Holy Roman Empire. This document decreed that the princes of the many territories of the Holy Roman Empire could decide whether their subjects would be Catholic or Protestant. But -- and here's the problem -- when I say Protestant, I mean Lutheran. Now as you no doubt know by now, Calvinism and Lutheranism were separate but related strains of Protestantism, and Calvinism was exerting some major influence in the Holy Roman Empire. But since the Peace of Augsburg had only two options -- Catholic or Lutheran -- in the Holy Roman Empire, the Calvinists were like, "Yeah, that ain't gonna work."

So when Catholic Ferdinand became king in the Calvinist territory of Bohemia, things started getting saucy. As Ferdinand started a program of re-Catholicizing Bohemia, the Calvinist nobility were like, "Nope." And to emphasize their point, the nobility threw two of Ferdinand's messengers out a window in an event known as the Defenestration of Prague -- defenestration being a fancy word for throwing someone out a window. Now these officials fell something like 70 feet and survived. Catholics said they survived because of the intercession of the Virgin Mary. Protestants pointed out that their fall was broken by a giant pile of manure. Now whether it was Mary's intercession or the poo, I'm not qualified to answer, but this event set off the Thirty Years' War.

Now there are four phases of this war you need to know, and that can be confusing, but the big idea to notice here is that as we go through the phases -- like as we move from phase one to phase four -- the motivations for fighting go from being primarily religious to primarily political.

So phase one: the Bohemian phase. In this phase, the Holy Roman Emperor and Catholic Ferdinand II defeated Protestant forces led by Frederick the First at the Battle of White Mountain. The result of this phase is that the Catholics gain the upper hand and re-establish Catholicism across many places in the Holy Roman Empire.

Then came phase two, namely the Danish phase. In this phase, King Christian IV of Denmark -- you know, that's the Danish part -- he took up the Protestant cause, not least because he was involved in an anti-Catholic, anti-Habsburg alliance with England. You can see here the political motive starting to bleed in. Now despite this help on the Protestant side, the Catholics still won this phase of the war.

And then came phase three: the Swedish phase. In this phase, the war begins to extend beyond the borders of the Holy Roman Empire, and King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden organizes the Protestant cause and armies and scores a major victory for the Protestants. Now one reason the Protestants fared so well is because Gustavus Adolphus was a military genius, but the other reason is because the Protestants received no small financial help from France. Wait a minute -- if I remember correctly from the beginning of this video, France was Catholic. So what in the fresh heck are they doing financing the Protestant struggle against the Catholics? Well, this is the major turning point where we can see that the religious character of the war has clearly taken a back seat to political concern. You see, the only thing the Catholic French leadership hated more than Protestants was the Habsburgs, and so they didn't care that the Protestants were fighting against them -- they just wanted to weaken the Habsburg influence.

Anyway, the fourth and final phase of the war was the French phase, and here France entered into the war on the side of the Protestants and fought mainly with Spain to assure that the Habsburgs would not rebound from their defeats. And in 1648, the Thirty Years' War finally came to an end with the signing of the Peace of Westphalia. And there are a couple of things you need to know about this major turning point in European history.

First, it essentially marked the end of the religious wars of Europe. Second, it amended the Peace of Augsburg to include Calvinism as a legitimate faith. Third, with that further splintering of Protestantism, it officially marked the end of the medieval idea of a universal Christendom. And fourth, it kept the Holy Roman Empire weak and the rulers of individual states strong, and in that way it hastened the decline of the Holy Roman Empire.
