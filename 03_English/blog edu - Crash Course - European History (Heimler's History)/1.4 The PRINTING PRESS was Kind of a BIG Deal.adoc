Okay, in the last couple of videos /I have mentioned two names. First was the father of humanism 人文主义之父, namely 即 our boy Petrarch 彼特拉克, and the second was the _poster 海报 boy_ 男性代言人 for 典型代表 Christian humanism 基督教人文主义, Erasmus 伊拉斯谟. Now here's what's interesting 有意思的是. For the most part 大部分情况下, the content of their writing and ideas was very similar, but only _a small handful of_ 一小部分 elite folks 精英人士 knew about Petrarch's writing, while _a metric butt load of 大量的 people_ engaged with 接触 the ideas of Erasmus. +

So if they're both basically saying (v.) the same things, why did Erasmus, who lived in the 16th century, have a much bigger reach 影响力范围 than Petrarch, who lived in the 14th century? Oh baby, you gotta love some AP Euro entries 美国大学预修课程欧洲历史的内容. Well, the major difference between these two writers was a new invention in the 1400s known as the printing press 印刷机. And if you're ready to give them brain cows milked movable type style 活字印刷风格的知识灌输, well then let's get to it. +

So it is very difficult to overstate 高估 the importance of the printing press in this time period, which is 1450 - 1648. Seriously, if you get to your AP exam 美国大学预修课程考试 and you get a question in this time period and your brain is a dried up sponge 干涸的海绵 with no squeezes left 毫无头绪, you just talk about the printing press and you know it's a pretty safe bet 稳妥的做法. +

Now, in order to understand the revolutionary nature 革命性 of this invention, let me introduce you to Johannes Gutenberg 约翰内斯·古腾堡. Along with 与…一起 other metalsmiths 金属工匠 of his age, Gutenberg created a new contraption 装置 called the printing press, and here's how it works. Now remember, prior to this 在这之前, books were copied by hand 手工抄写, and that made them incredibly expensive 极其昂贵 and thus only an elite few 少数精英 had access to 接触到 the ideas those books contained 包含的思想. +

But Gutenberg figured out 想出 that if he created wooden plates 木板 with rows of slots 一排排凹槽, he could slide 插入 individual metal letters 单个金属字母 into those slots, blot them with ink 蘸墨, and then press them onto paper 压印到纸上. And the word for that is movable type 活字印刷. Now he was able to slide these letters into the blocks 字模, make copies of the page 复制页面, and then slide them out 取出 and put all new letters in. +

And then, thanks to borrowed paper making technology 造纸技术 that had been brought into Europe from China, paper for books and pamphlets 小册子 and broadsides 大幅印刷品 could be had in great abundance 大量获得. In addition 此外, by the 15th century, there was a growing literacy 识字率 among urban populations 城市人口 around Europe, and that meant that the demand for books 书籍需求 was also increasing. +

So if you put the printing press, Chinese paper making technology, and spikes in literacy 识字率激增 in a pot 放在一起, well baby, you've got a stew going 形成了有利局面. And what do that stew tastes like? Well it tasted like a humorous demand for 对…的强烈需求 printed books. Now the first major work Gutenberg printed on his press was a Bible known as the Gutenberg Bible 古腾堡圣经 in 1456. +

And within 50 years of that publication 出版, there was something like 10 to 20 million books published throughout Europe thanks to Gutenberg's press and the many other printers that popped up 涌现 seemingly overnight 一夜之间. Now because printing was so easy and far cheaper than copying by hand, ideas were able to spread faster and wider as a result of this new technology. +

And look, if you can only remember one effect of the printing press, remember that one: ideas spread rapidly 迅速传播 because of printing. In fact, without the printing press, it may be that the ideas of the Renaissance 文艺复兴 cropping up 出现 in Italy would not have spread so quickly to the rest of Europe. Remember that one of the key emphases 重点 of the Renaissance was the revival 复兴 of classical literature 古典文学 from ancient Greece and Rome. +

So by 1550, basically all the major classical authors were in print 已出版 and spreading rapidly. Additionally 此外, since printing provided people with identical copies of books 相同的书籍副本 -- which wasn't something that was guaranteed 保证 in the age of hand - copied books 手抄本时代 -- they were more able to easily discuss the ideas contained in the writing 书中包含的思想. And yet another effect was an increase in literacy 识字率提高. +

Now I mentioned that before as a cause of the spread of literature, but once that literature spread to more and more people, people began demanding more reading material 阅读材料, and the printers got to work satisfying that demand quick, fast, and in a hurry 迅速满足需求. And the last effect of printing you should know is the increasing demand for vernacular literature 白话文学. +

Now vernacular 白话 just means the language of the people 人民的语言, so while many of the earliest printed books were published in Latin 拉丁语 or Greek 希腊语, this proliferation 激增 of reading created a demand for books in English or German or Italian or French or whatever. And as we'll talk more about in another video, when the people got their hands on vernacular literature, it had the effect of growing and solidifying 巩固 their national culture 民族文化. +

Or to put it another way 换句话说, through vernacular literature, people were able to get a better sense of who they were and how they were different from every other group.

== 中文释义

好的，在之前的几个视频中我提到了两个人的名字。第一个是**"人文主义之父"，也就是我们所说的彼特拉克（Petrarch）**，第二个是**"基督教人文主义"的典型代表，伊拉斯谟**（Erasmus）。现在有趣的地方来了。在很大程度上，他们作品的内容和思想非常相似，*但只有少数精英人士了解彼特拉克的作品，而大量的人接触到了伊拉斯谟的思想。* +

所以，如果他们基本上表达的是相同的内容，为什么生活在16世纪的伊拉斯谟，其影响力比生活在14世纪的彼特拉克大得多呢？哦，宝贝，你肯定会喜欢AP欧洲历史中的这些内容。嗯，*这两位作家之间影响力的主要区别, 在于15世纪的一项新发明，也就是印刷术*（printing press）。如果你准备好深入了解活字印刷术（movable type）的相关内容，那么我们开始吧。 +

在1450年至1648年这个时期，印刷术的重要性怎么强调都不为过。说真的，如果你参加AP考试，遇到这个时期的问题，而你的大脑像"一块挤不出水的干海绵"一样没思路，你只要谈谈印刷术，就知道这是一个相当稳妥的选择。 +

现在，为了理解这项发明的革命性，让我给你介绍一下约翰内斯·谷登堡（Johannes Gutenberg）。谷登堡和他那个时代的其他金属工匠一起，创造了一种新装置，也就是印刷机（printing press），下面是它的工作原理。记住，*在此之前，书籍都是手工抄写的，这使得书籍极其昂贵，因此只有少数精英能够接触到这些书籍所包含的思想。* +

但是谷登堡发现，如果他制作带有一排排插槽的木板，他就可以把单个的金属字母滑进这些插槽，蘸上墨水，然后压在纸上。这个东西就叫做活字印刷（movable type）。现在他能够把这些字母滑进字模中，复制页面，然后把字母滑出来，再放入全新的字母。 +

然后，由于从中国传入欧洲的造纸技术，用于书籍、小册子和大幅印刷品的纸张, 变得大量可得。此外，*到15世纪，欧洲城市人口的识字率不断提高，这意味着对书籍的需求也在增加。* +

所以，如果你把印刷术、中国的造纸技术, 以及识字率的提高都考虑进来，宝贝，就像炖菜一样。那么这炖菜是什么味道呢？嗯，这意味着对印刷书籍的需求变得很大。谷登堡在他的印刷机上印刷的第一部重要作品, 是1456年的《谷登堡圣经》（Gutenberg Bible）。 +

在这部作品出版后的50年内，由于谷登堡的印刷机, 以及许多其他一夜之间涌现的印刷商，欧洲出版了大约1000万到2000万本书籍。现在，*因为印刷比手工抄写容易得多，也便宜得多，所以这项新技术使得思想能够传播得更快、更广。* +

听着，如果你只能记住**印刷术的一个影响，**那就记住这一点：**印刷术使得思想迅速传播。**事实上，**#如果没有印刷术，在意大利兴起的文艺复兴思想, 可能不会如此迅速地传播到欧洲其他地区。#**记住，文艺复兴的一个关键重点是古希腊和古罗马经典文学的复兴。 +

**所以到1550年，基本上所有主要的古典作家的作品, 都被印刷出来, 并迅速传播。**此外，由于印刷术为人们提供了完全相同的书籍副本——这在手工抄写书籍的时代是无法保证的——人们更能够轻松地讨论这些作品中包含的思想。*还有一个影响是"识字率的提高"。* +

我之前提到, 识字率的提高, 是文学传播的一个原因，但一旦文学传播到越来越多的人手中，人们就开始要求更多的阅读材料，而印刷商们也迅速努力满足这一需求。你应该知道的**印刷术的最后一个影响, 是对通俗文学（vernacular literature）的需求不断增加。** +

现在，“vernacular” 的意思是"普通人使用的语言"，所以虽然**许多最早的印刷书籍, 是用拉丁语或希腊语出版的，但阅读材料的大量涌现, 产生了对用英语、德语、意大利语、法语或其他语言编写的书籍的需求。**正如我们将在另一个视频中详细讨论的那样，*#当人们接触到(母语)通俗文学时，它起到了发展和巩固他们"民族文化"的作用 (就相当于中国用各地"地方方言"来印刷书籍, 地方方言电视台, 就起到了保护地方文化, 和让人们形成"地方意识"的作用)。#* +

或者换一种说法，通过通俗文学，人们能够更好地了解自己，以及他们与其他群体的不同之处。好了，如果这对你有帮助，那么你应该点击这里，因为我所有的第一单元视频都在这里，点击这里获取我的AP欧洲历史复习资料包，它包含了你在课堂上取得A的成绩以及在五月份的考试中获得5分所需的一切内容。 +

好的，感谢观看。海姆勒（Heimler）下线。 +
