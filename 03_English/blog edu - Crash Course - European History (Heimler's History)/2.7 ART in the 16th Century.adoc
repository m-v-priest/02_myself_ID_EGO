Now in the midst of 在……之中 all this change we've been talking about in the previous videos -- like the Protestant Reformation 新教改革 and the Catholic Reformation 天主教改革 and all the dang （俚语，该死的） Wars of Religion 宗教战争 -- art began to change in Europe as well. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked mannerism 风格主义 and Baroque style 巴洛克风格, then let's get to it. Oh, and if you want to follow along note guides 配套笔记指南 for this video, a link is in the description. +

So remember that the chief philosophy 主要哲学思想 of the Renaissance 文艺复兴 was humanism 人文主义, which taught the unlimited potential 无限潜力 of human beings, and that unlimited potential often came at the expense of 以……为代价 religion. "You have everything you need inside of you," humanism would say, "and you don't need any Pope 教皇 with any funny hat or any fairy god in the sky to tell you what's what." So as a result of the Renaissance, there was a real secular movement 世俗运动 across Europe, and the art of the Renaissance in a lot of ways reflected that secularizing force 世俗化力量. +

But then came the Protestant Reformation, and that got Europeans feeling all faithy-faithy again. And it was out of this revival of religious affections 宗教情感的复兴 that a new wave of art called mannerism 风格主义 arose in the 1520s and the 1530s. Now the title "mannerism" was at first an insult 侮辱. The critics of this new form said that the artists painted in the manner of 以……的方式 great artists of the Renaissance but lacked their artistic genius 艺术天赋. In other words, mannerist artists 风格主义艺术家, according to their critics, were just budget Michelangelo 廉价版米开朗基罗. +

But despite their criticism, mannerism became an important artistic movement precisely because it reflected the European yearning for 渴望 spiritual experience 精神体验. In terms of style 在风格方面, mannerists made use of 利用 distorted figures 扭曲的人物形象 and violated the rules of proportion 违反比例规则 in order to express intense suffering 强烈的痛苦 and emotion 情感. For example, the greatest of all the mannerists was El Greco 埃尔·格列柯, and here's his painting called "Laocoön 拉奥孔". Notice the distorted figures that are much less idealized 理想化 than Renaissance figures, and the ominous sky 不祥的天空 and muted colors 柔和的色彩 give the scene a real sense of heightened drama 强烈的戏剧性 and emotion. +

Now in the last quarter 最后四分之一 of the 16th century, mannerism fell out of vogue 不再流行, and what came to replace it was a new style called Baroque 巴洛克风格. Now Baroque artists 巴洛克艺术家 attempted to merge 融合 the classical ideals 古典理想 of the Renaissance with the rising religious affections of the age. So Renaissance humanistic art 文艺复兴人文主义艺术 -- you think it; mannerist art 风格主义艺术 -- you feel it; Baroque art 巴洛克艺术 -- you both. So Baroque art still emphasized 强调 powerful emotion 强烈的情感, but it did so according to classical proportion 古典比例. In general, Baroque art was extravagant in form 形式奢华, ornate 华丽的 and detailed in style 风格细致, and highly emotional and dramatic in subject 主题极具情感和戏剧性. +

Probably the greatest painter of the Baroque style was Peter Paul Rubens 彼得·保罗·鲁本斯. Here in this painting titled "The Elevation of the Cross 上十字架", you can see the intense action 激烈的动作 and emotions surrounding the body of Christ 围绕在基督身体周围的情感. And then probably the greatest Baroque sculptor 巴洛克雕塑家 was Gian Lorenzo Bernini 詹洛伦佐·贝尼尼. His sculptures 雕塑 are highly detailed 细节丰富 and communicate emotion and drama and intensity 传达情感、戏剧性和强烈感. Additionally 此外, Bernini was responsible for 负责 the magnificent colonnade 宏伟的柱廊 on the piazza 广场 in front of Saint Peter's Basilica 圣彼得大教堂. +

And since we're talking about the church, I should tell you that the Catholic Church 天主教会 deeply embraced 欣然接受 Baroque art. Remember that during this time the church had a bunch of egg on its face （俚语，丢脸） because of the Protestant Reformation and was undergoing a reformation of its own. And so in order to consolidate their power 巩固权力 and put the grandiosity 宏伟；壮观 of their reformed doctrines 改革后的教义 on display, they commissioned 委托创作 a bunch of art from Baroque style artists. That was true not only because the Baroque style captured the religious emotion of the time, but also because Baroque art was more straightforward 直白的 than mannerist art was. And if Catholics needed anything during this time, it was straightforwardness 直白 as they attempted to make up for 弥补 the losses they suffered at the hands of 在……手中 the Protestants. +

== 中文释义

现在，在我们之前的视频中所谈论的所有这些变化之中——比如新教改革、天主教改革以及所有那些宗教战争——欧洲的艺术也开始发生变化。所以，如果你准备好了解风格主义（mannerism）和巴洛克风格（Baroque style）的知识，那我们开始吧。哦，如果你想要这个视频的跟随笔记指南，描述中有一个链接。  +

要记住，文艺复兴（Renaissance）的主要哲学是人文主义（humanism），它宣扬人类拥有无限的潜力，而这种无限的潜力常常以牺牲宗教为代价。人文主义会说：“你自身拥有你所需要的一切。” “你不需要任何戴着滑稽帽子的教皇，也不需要天空中的神仙来告诉你什么是什么。” 所以，由于文艺复兴，欧洲出现了一场真正的世俗运动，文艺复兴时期的艺术在很多方面都反映了这种世俗化的力量。  +

但随后新教改革（Protestant Reformation）到来，这让欧洲人再次感受到了宗教情感。正是出于这种宗教情感的复兴，在16世纪20年代和30年代，一种名为风格主义（mannerism）的新艺术浪潮出现了。起初，“风格主义” 这个名称带有侮辱性。对这种新艺术形式的批评者说，这些艺术家模仿文艺复兴时期伟大艺术家的风格作画，但缺乏他们的艺术天赋。换句话说，在批评者看来，风格主义艺术家只是廉价版的米开朗基罗（Michelangelo）。  +

但尽管遭到批评，风格主义还是成为了一场重要的艺术运动，正是因为它反映了欧洲人对精神体验的渴望。在风格方面，风格主义艺术家利用扭曲的人物形象，打破了比例规则，以此来表达强烈的痛苦和情感。例如，最伟大的风格主义艺术家之一是埃尔·格列柯（El Greco），这是他的画作《拉奥孔》（Laocoön）。注意那些扭曲的人物形象，远不如文艺复兴时期的人物理想化，不祥的天空和柔和的色彩赋予了这个场景一种强烈的戏剧性和情感。  +

在16世纪最后25年，风格主义不再流行，取而代之的是一种名为巴洛克（Baroque）的新风格。巴洛克艺术家试图将文艺复兴时期的古典理想与那个时代不断高涨的宗教情感融合起来。所以，文艺复兴时期的人文主义艺术——你去思考它；风格主义艺术——你去感受它；巴洛克艺术——你既要思考也要感受。巴洛克艺术仍然强调强烈的情感，但它是按照古典比例来表现的。总的来说，巴洛克艺术形式奢华，风格华丽且细节丰富，主题充满情感和戏剧性。  +

巴洛克风格（Baroque style）最伟大的画家可能是彼得·保罗·鲁本斯（Peter Paul Rubens）。在这幅名为《基督被抬上十字架》（The Elevation of the Cross）的画作中，你可以看到围绕着基督身体的强烈动作和情感。而最伟大的巴洛克雕塑家可能是吉安·洛伦佐·贝尼尼（Gian Lorenzo Bernini）。他的雕塑细节极其丰富，传达出情感、戏剧性和强烈的感染力。此外，贝尼尼还负责圣彼得大教堂（Saint Peter's Basilica）前面广场上宏伟的柱廊设计。  +

既然我们在谈论教会，我应该告诉你，天主教会（Catholic Church）非常推崇巴洛克艺术。要记住，在这个时期，由于新教改革，教会颜面扫地，自身也在进行改革。所以，为了巩固他们的权力，并展示他们改革教义的宏伟，他们委托了许多巴洛克风格的艺术家进行创作。这不仅是因为巴洛克风格捕捉到了当时的宗教情感，还因为巴洛克艺术比风格主义艺术更直接明了。在这个时期，天主教徒们需要的就是直接明了，因为他们试图弥补在新教徒手中遭受的损失。  +
