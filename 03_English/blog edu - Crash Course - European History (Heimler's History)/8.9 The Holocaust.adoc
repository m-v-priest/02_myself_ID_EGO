Now one of the more devastating 毁灭性的 outcomes of World War II was the Nazi policy of the mass extermination 大规模灭绝 of the Jews, and what became known as the Holocaust 大屠杀. And in this video, we're going to look at why it happened and its results. +

So when Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, he made no attempt to hide the racialist 种族主义的 motivations that drove his actions. You see, Hitler came to find great comfort in the fact that modern Germans were the descendants 后代；后裔 of an ancient group of Germanic-speaking peoples known as the Aryans 雅利安人. Hitler and the rest who thought like him believed the Aryans were the master race 优等种族 of the earth, and thus the master race ought to claim its place of ascendancy 优势；支配地位 in the world. And Hitler trained his mind to believe that the most virulent 恶毒的；恶性的 threat to the flourishing 繁荣；兴旺 of the modern master race was the Jewish population of Europe. And so once Hitler had come to power, he began implementing 实施；执行 policies to establish this new racial order 种族秩序. +

So starting in 1935, Hitler's anti-Jewish policies were mild compared to what they would later become. The first major iteration 版本；迭代 of this plan came in the form of the Nuremberg Laws 纽伦堡法案, which put Hitler's racialist ideology 意识形态 into law. The first law established that only people of pure German blood could be citizens, and thus Jews were stripped of 剥夺 their citizenship. The second law made it illegal for pureblood Germans to intermarry 通婚 with Jews. +

And then in 1939, Hitler's policy shifted towards Jewish emigration 移民（移出）. Remember, emigration is when people leave a country; immigration 移民（移入） is when people come into a country. Now the most robust 详尽的；周全的 plan coming out of this idea was to ship all the Jews to the African island of Madagascar. However, when World War II started, Hitler no longer had the time or attention to manage the complexities of his Jewish emigration plans, and that's when things turned much darker. +

In 1942, something called the Wannsee Conference 万湖会议 was held in which Nazi leaders Reinhard Heydrich, Heinrich Himmler, and Hitler articulated 明确表达 what became known as the Final Solution 最终解决方案 to the Jewish problem. And the Final Solution was not the emigration of Jews, but rather their complete extermination. +

Now even before the Wannsee Conference, the Nazis had been building death camps 死亡集中营 to put Jews to death. And to be fair, it wasn't only Jews -- and we'll talk more about those other groups in a moment. Now the death camps -- the most notorious 臭名昭著的 of which were Auschwitz 奥斯威辛集中营 and Dachau 达豪集中营 -- were the Nazis' way of systematizing 使系统化, making more efficient the process of mass extermination. +

So essentially, whenever Germany occupied a territory in the war, they rounded up 围捕；集合 all the Jews in that area, packed them tightly into train cars, and then shipped them to the death camp. Once they arrived, each one of them had a brief medical examination. About 20 to 30% of them -- mostly men -- were sent to work in the camp on behalf of 代表 the German war effort, and the other 70 to 80% were murdered shortly thereafter. +

The group who did not make the cut 符合要求 were told that they would be showered and deloused 除虱. So they were made to remove their clothes and then forced into a massive concrete box with shower heads. Sometimes they understood what was happening and they resisted, but other times they did not. But once they arrived in that box, the doors were closed and it was pumped full of hydrogen cyanide 氰化氢, and five minutes later they were dead. And in this way, around 6 million Jews were murdered by the Nazis. +

And Hitler's dedication 专注；执着 to this atrocity 暴行 was so great that the transportation of Jews to the death camps always took priority 优先；优先权 on the rail lines, even if there was a desperate need on the warfront 前线. +

Now in addition to the Jews, Nazis targeted other groups for extermination as well, and as a result another four to five million people were killed in addition to the Jews. The Roma people 罗姆人 were also judged to be an inferior race 劣等种族, and for that -- although the number is debated -- up to 1.5 million of them were exterminated. Additionally, the Nazis targeted homosexuals 同性恋者, Slavic people 斯拉夫人, and people with disabilities 残疾人 to be killed in the death camps. +

== 中文释义

实际上，第二次世界大战一个极其具有毁灭性的后果是纳粹大规模灭绝犹太人的政策，也就是人们熟知的大屠杀（Holocaust）。在这个视频中，我们将探讨它发生的原因以及造成的后果。 +

阿道夫·希特勒（Adolf Hitler）在德国掌权后，丝毫不掩饰驱使他行动的种族主义动机。要知道，希特勒认为现代德国人是一个被称为雅利安人（Aryans）的古代日耳曼语系民族的后裔，这让他感到无比宽慰。希特勒以及和他想法一致的人认为雅利安人是地球上的优等种族，因此优等种族理应在世界上占据主导地位。希特勒洗脑自己，坚信对现代优等种族的繁荣构成最致命威胁的是欧洲的犹太人群体。所以希特勒掌权后，就开始实施政策来建立这种新的种族秩序。 +

从1935年开始，希特勒的反犹政策相较于后来的情况还算温和。这个计划的第一个重大版本以《纽伦堡法案》（Nuremberg Laws）的形式出现，该法案将希特勒的种族主义意识形态写入法律。第一条法律规定，只有拥有纯正德国血统的人才能成为公民，因此犹太人被剥夺了公民身份。第二条法律规定，纯种德国人与犹太人通婚是非法的。 +

到了1939年，希特勒的政策转向让犹太人移民。记住，“emigration”（移民出境）指的是人们离开一个国家；“immigration”（移民入境）指的是人们进入一个国家。基于这个想法，最全面的计划是把所有犹太人运往非洲的马达加斯加岛（Madagascar）。然而，第二次世界大战爆发后，希特勒没有时间和精力去处理犹太人移民计划中的复杂问题，从那时起，情况变得更加黑暗。 +

1942年，召开了一次名为万湖会议（Wannsee Conference）的会议，纳粹领导人莱因哈德·海德里希（Reinhard Heydrich）、海因里希·希姆莱（Heinrich Himmler）和希特勒阐述了后来被称为解决犹太人问题的“最终方案”（Final Solution）。这个“最终方案”不是让犹太人移民，而是将他们彻底灭绝。 +

实际上，在万湖会议之前，纳粹就已经在建造死亡集中营来处决犹太人。公平地说，受害者不只是犹太人 —— 我们一会儿会更多地谈到其他群体。这些死亡集中营 —— 其中最臭名昭著的是奥斯威辛集中营（Auschwitz）和达豪集中营（Dachau） —— 是纳粹将大规模灭绝系统化、提高灭绝效率的手段。 +

基本上，德国在战争中占领一个地区后，就会围捕该地区的所有犹太人，把他们紧紧地塞进火车车厢，然后运往死亡集中营。他们到达后，每个人都要进行简短的体检。大约20%到30%的人 —— 主要是男性 —— 被送去集中营为德国的战争努力工作，另外70%到80%的人随后不久就被杀害了。 +

那些不符合工作条件的人被告知他们要去洗澡和除虱。于是他们被迫脱掉衣服，然后被赶进一个装有淋浴喷头的巨大混凝土房间。有时他们明白即将发生什么并进行反抗，但有时他们并不清楚。但一旦他们进入那个房间，门就会关上，然后往里面注入氰化氢，五分钟后他们就死了。通过这种方式，大约600万犹太人被纳粹杀害。 +

希特勒对这一暴行极为执着，以至于将犹太人运往死亡集中营的运输在铁路运输中总是优先进行，即使在战争前线急需运输物资的时候也是如此。 +

除了犹太人之外，纳粹还将其他群体列为灭绝对象，结果除了犹太人之外，又有四五百万的人被杀害。罗姆人（Roma people）也被判定为劣等种族，为此 —— 尽管具体数字存在争议 —— 多达150万的罗姆人被灭绝。此外，纳粹还将同性恋者、斯拉夫人（Slavic people）和残疾人送往死亡集中营处决。 +
