So we've been talking about the Cold War -- that decades-long standoff 对峙 between the Soviet Union and the United States after World War II -- and so far we've been focusing on the tension between these two superpowers. But in this video, we're going to consider the political and economic ramifications 影响；后果 of the Cold War. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

So as you'll no doubt remember if you've been with me in these last few Unit 9 videos, much of what was happening in Western Europe during the Cold War was intimately tied to 与……密切相关 the policies of the United States. So essentially, because the United States exerted 施加；运用 a profound amount of military, economic, and political influence in the West, it was the U.S. calling many of the shots 说了算；发号施令. +

And one of the big moves the U.S. made during this time was the establishment of NATO, or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 北大西洋公约组织. Because the big bad Soviets were always threatening to expand into the West, NATO was a military defense pact 军事防御条约 that many Western European nations signed with the United States. The idea was if any one state was attacked, then they were in essence all attacked and would therefore all respond. +

Now another big move was economic in nature, and it included the establishment of two entities 实体. First was the World Bank 世界银行, which was established in 1944 in order to provide loans 贷款 to countries that needed to rebuild after the war. Later in the century, the World Bank shifted its focus to make loans to developing nations, but regardless, the goal of the World Bank was to make sure that a global economic catastrophe 灾难 like the Great Depression 大萧条 didn't happen again. +

And also in 1944, the International Monetary Fund 国际货币基金组织 was established, which facilitated 促进；推动 international currency exchange 国际货币兑换 and encouraged global trade. And speaking of global trade, in 1995 the World Trade Organization 世界贸易组织 was created, and this entity was responsible for generating and enforcing 制定和执行 a set of rules that govern international trade. The idea here is the same as the organization it replaced, namely the GATT, or the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 关税及贸易总协定. Both organizations, among other things, aimed to reduce tariffs 关税 between member nations so that trade can flow as freely as possible between them. +

Okay, so that's basically what was going on in the West during the 20th century. Though there was plenty to complain about with the organizations that I just mentioned, politically and economically the West was doing pretty well. But in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, it was a different story altogether. +

Countries east of the Iron Curtain 铁幕, known as the Soviet Bloc 苏联集团, came under the military, political, and economic domination 统治 of the Soviet Union. Their answer to the IMF and the World Bank and the Marshall Plan 马歇尔计划 was the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance 经济互助委员会, and the goal of this organization was to bind 使结合；使联合 Soviet states into a mutually reinforcing 相互加强的 economic system which would make them all dependent on the Soviet Union. Their answer to NATO was the Warsaw Pact 华沙条约组织, which was a military alliance 军事联盟 with the satellite states 卫星国 of the Soviet Union, which again would require dependence on the Soviet Union in those places. +

Now so far it just sounds like we have similar situations in the East and the West. In the West, the United States led to the creation of many of the organizations that I mentioned before, and in a lot of ways membership in those organizations and treaties made Western Europe dependent on the United States. And that's essentially what's happening in the East as well, except with the Soviet Union. But here's where the comparison starts to crumble 崩溃；瓦解. Soviet Bloc nations did not, I repeat, did not flourish 繁荣；兴旺 economically like Western Europe did, and this was largely because of the Soviet economic model of planned economy 计划经济. +

Now not every state in the Soviet Bloc was communist, but they all had planned economies, and here's what that means. The economic output 经济产出 of these satellite states were planned by a committee within the Soviet Union. This meant that each state was told what to produce, how much of it to produce, and where they could sell. So in that way, states in the Soviet Bloc did not produce for their own benefit but rather for the overall benefit of the Soviet Union, often to their own hurt. +

Stalin implemented 实施 a series of five-year plans 五年计划 whose goals were the rapid industrialization 快速工业化 of the Soviet Union and economic flourishing 经济繁荣. And while some of these plans might be considered successful, they came at a heavy cost to Soviet citizens. For example, one of Stalin's five-year plans emphasized the collectivization of agriculture 农业集体化, and this was implemented in the Soviet Bloc state in Ukraine. Many farmers rebelled against the collectivization, and as a result they got blacklisted 列入黑名单 for Soviet food distribution. As a result, something like 5 million people died of starvation 饥饿. +

Now in addition to planned economies, the Soviet Union -- led by the dictates of communism -- extended social welfare benefits 社会福利 to its citizens. The state provided for many of the needs of the people, including housing and health care. But the state-run services were often poorly implemented. State-sponsored housing, for example, included hastily built apartment complexes 公寓楼 which were shoddily constructed 粗制滥造的 and at times required more than one family to live in a single small apartment. The Soviets also provided universal education 普及教育 to children, even if it did include a healthy dose of communist indoctrination 共产主义灌输. +

Now in order to achieve this level of centralization 集权化, the Soviet Union systematically removed civil liberties 公民自由 and individual rights of the population. Stalin created huge networks of secret police 秘密警察, both in the Soviet Union proper 苏联本土 and in the Soviet Bloc. How you're going to be a ruthless 无情的, non-accommodating 不妥协的 dictator 独裁者 without a robust 强大的 secret police? Can't do it. Can't do it. Anyway, they were responsible for rooting out 根除 those who dissented from the Communist Party's agenda 共产党的议程, and in order to make those threats stick, the secret police were authorized to use violence and subversion 暴力和颠覆手段 to keep the populations in check 控制；管束. +

But hey, you know, if anyone got a little grumpy 不满的 about living in a planned economy where their rights were systematically suppressed 压制, they could just get up and move to the West, right? No. Immigration from the Soviet Union was severely restrictive 严格限制的, and it's not hard to understand why. Communism is supposed to be the fulfillment of all of humanity's dreams, and so if everyone is miserable and fleeing to the West, yeah, it's not the World Bank was established in 1944 in order to provide loans to countries that needed to rebuild after the war. Later in the century, the World Bank shifted its best PR. +

Anyway, one of the best illustrations 例证 of the restriction on immigration was the construction of the Berlin Wall 柏林墙. So many East Berliners were fleeing to the democratic West Berlin where the economy and individual liberties flourished, so Stalin went ahead and built a massive wall to prevent East Berliners from fleeing to that filthy democratic West. +

Now most of the policies I just mentioned remained in place until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. However, after Stalin died, things did get a little better under his successor Nikita Khrushchev 尼基塔·赫鲁晓夫. In 1956 when Khrushchev came to power, he publicly denounced 谴责 Stalin for the authoritarian turd that he was and began a process of de-Stalinization 去斯大林化 in the Soviet Union. Under these policies, more freedom was granted to artists who, under Stalin, were forced to produce art that only glorified the Soviet Union. Khrushchev released many of Stalin's political prisoners 政治犯 and scaled back 缩减；削减 the secret police. He also implemented some economic policies that helped average Soviet citizens, like a 40-hour work week 每周40小时工作制 and allowing for more freedom for people to choose their career. +

Now part of this de-Stalinization program was to ease 减轻；缓和 the heavy Soviet influence in the Soviet Bloc states. Khrushchev made it clear that more civil liberties would be tolerated in these satellite states and that some limited free trade 有限的自由贸易 would also be implemented. And when the people of those countries heard this, they were like, "Oh heck yeah!" But unfortunately for Khrushchev, the Soviet economy entered a severe recession 严重衰退 from 1953 to 1964, and that meant that none of Khrushchev's promised economic reforms became much of a reality. +

So in some of the Soviet Bloc nations who, you know, initially got excited at the prospect of retreating Soviet influence, as the economy began to flag 衰退, they found it more and more difficult to tolerate Soviet policies of oppression 压迫 in their country. And that led to some significant revolt 起义；反抗 in the Soviet Bloc, and I'll tell you about two. +

First was the Hungarian Revolution 匈牙利革命 that occurred in 1956. A reform-minded leader named Imre Nagy 伊姆雷·纳吉 demanded that Hungary have free and open elections unhindered by Soviet influence and, more to the point, Hungarian independence 匈牙利独立. Now it's important to remember that Nagy was himself a communist and never abandoned his ideals, but by this point Soviet oppression in Hungary was so profound and stifling 压抑的 that Nagy, along with thousands of protesters, believed that this was the best way forward for Hungary's future. And so upon announcing that Hungary would leave the Warsaw Pact 华沙条约组织 and seek the protection of the United Nations, the Soviets sent troops to Budapest, killing almost 3,000 and crushing the revolution. As a result, the Soviet grip on Hungary grew tighter and more oppressive. +

The second was the invasion of Czechoslovakia 入侵捷克斯洛伐克 in 1968. And here another reform-minded leader was elected -- still a communist, just a reform-minded communist -- and he enacted many liberal reforms 自由改革 that were way outside the bounds of Soviet policy. So as a result, Warsaw Pact troops invaded Czechoslovakia, stopped the reforms, and strengthened the more oppressive wing of the Communist Party there. +

There were also peaceful revolutions 和平革命 that mainly occurred in 1989. The impetus 推动；促进 for these revolutions came as a result of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's 米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫 announcement that year that the Soviet Union would no longer intervene militarily in the Soviet Bloc to support the communist governments there. And with those strictures 限制 removed, Hungary, for example, instituted 实行；建立 the Western economic reforms that they had been trying to put in place since the revolution of 1956. However, this time those reforms went unopposed by the Soviet Union. So in 1990, Hungarians elected a government committed to democracy and free market economics. +

By 1991, Gorbachev's policies of glasnost 公开性 and perestroika 改革 -- which introduced more openness and some limited free market economics into the Soviet Union -- ultimately led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. With the earlier Soviet oppression lifted, many of the Soviet Bloc states experienced a surge in nationalism 民族主义 and broke free, ultimately completing the process of dismantling 解体；瓦解 the Soviet Union. +

所以我们一直在谈论冷战 —— 也就是第二次世界大战后苏联和美国之间长达数十年的对峙 —— 到目前为止我们一直关注的是这两个超级大国之间的紧张局势。但在这个视频中，我们将探讨冷战在政治和经济方面的影响。所以如果你准备好获取知识，那就开始吧。 +

如果你一直在看我第9单元的视频，毫无疑问你会记得，冷战期间西欧发生的许多事情, 都与美国的政策密切相关。所以本质上，由于美国在西方施加了巨大的军事、经济和政治影响，在很多事情上都是美国说了算。 +

美国在这一时期的一个重大举措, 是建立了北约（NATO，North Atlantic Treaty Organization）。因为强大的苏联一直威胁要向西扩张，*#北约是许多西欧国家与美国签署的一项军事防御条约。其理念是，如果任何一个国家受到攻击，那么就相当于所有国家都受到攻击，因此所有国家都会做出回应。#* +

另一个重大举措, 本质上是经济方面的，其中包括建立了两个实体。第一个是**"世界银行"（the World Bank），它于1944年成立，目的是向战后需要重建的国家提供贷款。在本世纪后期，世界银行将重点转向向"发展中国家"提供贷款，但无论如何，#"世界银行"的目标是确保像大萧条（the Great Depression）那样的全球经济灾难不再发生。# **+

**同样在1944年，"国际货币基金组织"（the International Monetary Fund）成立，它促进了国际货币兑换, 并鼓励了全球贸易。**说到全球贸易，**1995年##世界贸易组织##（the World Trade Organization）成立，这个实体##负责制定和执行一套管理国际贸易的规则。##**其理念与它所取代的组织 —— 关税及贸易总协定（GATT，the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade）是一样的。这两个组织，除其他方面外，*#旨在减少成员国之间的关税，以便贸易能够尽可能自由地进行。#* +

好的，这基本上就是20世纪西方的情况。尽管我刚才提到的那些组织有很多可抱怨的地方，但从政治和经济方面来看，西方发展得相当不错。但在东欧和苏联，情况则完全不同。 +

铁幕（the Iron Curtain）以东的国家，也就是苏联阵营（the Soviet Bloc），受到了苏联在军事、政治和经济上的统治。他们针对国际货币基金组织、世界银行和马歇尔计划（the Marshall Plan）的应对措施, 是成立了"经济互助委员会"（the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance），这个组织的目标, 是将苏联阵营的国家绑定在一个相互加强的经济体系中，使它们都依赖于苏联。 +
他们针对"北约"的应对措施, 是"华沙条约组织"（the Warsaw Pact），这是一个与苏联卫星国的军事联盟，同样使这些地方依赖于苏联。 +

到目前为止，听起来东西方的情况类似。在西方，美国主导建立了我之前提到的许多组织，**在很多方面，加入这些组织和签署条约, 使西欧依赖于美国。而在东方本质上也是如此，只不过依赖的是苏联。**但这种比较从这里开始站不住脚。苏联阵营的国家经济并没有像西欧那样繁荣，很大程度上是因为苏联的计划经济模式。 +

并不是苏联阵营的每个国家都是共产主义国家，但它们都实行计划经济，这意味着什么呢。**这些卫星国的经济产出, 由苏联内部的一个委员会来规划。**这意味着每个国家被告知生产什么、生产多少以及在哪里销售。所以从这个角度看，苏联阵营的国家不是为了自身利益而生产，而是为了苏联的整体利益，这往往对它们自身造成了损害。 +

**斯大林实施了一系列五年计划，目标是实现苏联的快速"工业化"**和经济繁荣。虽然这些计划中的一些可能被认为是成功的，但它们让苏联公民付出了沉重的代价。例如，*斯大林的一个五年计划强调农业集体化，这一政策在苏联阵营的乌克兰实施。许多农民反抗集体化，结果他们被列入了苏联食品分配的黑名单。结果，大约500万人死于饥饿。* +

除了"计划经济"之外，苏联在共产主义的指导下，向其公民提供社会福利。国家满足了人们的许多需求，包括住房和医疗保健。但国家运营的服务往往实施得很糟糕。例如，国家资助的住房包括匆忙建造的公寓楼，这些公寓楼建造得很粗糙，有时一个小公寓里要住不止一个家庭。*苏联还为儿童提供普及教育，即使其中包含大量的共产主义思想灌输。* +

为了实现这种高度的中央集权，苏联有系统地剥夺了民众的公民自由和个人权利。斯大林在苏联本土和苏联阵营, 建立了庞大的秘密警察网络。如果没有强大的秘密警察，一个独裁者又怎么能做到冷酷无情、不容异己呢？做不到。不管怎样，秘密警察负责铲除那些反对共产党议程的人，为了让这些威胁生效，秘密警察被授权使用暴力和颠覆手段来控制民众。 +

但是，嘿，你知道吗，如果有人对生活在一个权利被系统压制的"计划经济体制"下感到不满，他们可以起身搬到西方去，对吧？不对。从苏联移民受到严重限制，这并不难理解。共产主义本应实现全人类的梦想，所以如果每个人都痛苦不堪并逃往西方，这可不是什么好的宣传。 +

不管怎样，对移民限制的一个最好例证就是柏林墙（the Berlin Wall）的修建。许多东柏林人逃往经济繁荣、个人自由得到保障的西柏林，所以斯大林下令修建了一堵巨大的墙，以阻止东柏林人逃往那个 “肮脏” 的民主的西柏林。 +

我刚才提到的大多数政策, 一直持续到1991年苏联解体。然而，**斯大林死后，他的继任者尼基塔·赫鲁晓夫（Nikita Khrushchev）执政期间情况有所好转。1956年赫鲁晓夫上台后，他公开谴责斯大林是一个独裁者，并在苏联开始了"去斯大林化"的进程。**在这些政策下，艺术家获得了更多自由，在斯大林统治时期，他们被迫创作只赞美苏联的艺术作品。赫鲁晓夫释放了许多斯大林时期的政治犯，并缩减了秘密警察的规模。他还实施了一些对普通苏联公民有帮助的经济政策，比如实行每周40小时工作制，并允许人们在选择职业方面有更多自由。 +

"去斯大林化"计划的一部分, 是减轻苏联对苏联阵营国家的强大影响。赫鲁晓夫明确表示，这些卫星国将被容忍享有更多公民自由，并且将实施一些有限的自由贸易。当这些国家的人民听到这个消息时，他们都很兴奋。*但对赫鲁晓夫来说不幸的是，从1953年到1964年，苏联经济陷入严重衰退，这意味着赫鲁晓夫承诺的经济改革,大多没有实现。* +

所以在一些苏联阵营国家，最初对苏联影响力减弱的前景感到兴奋，但随着经济开始衰退，它们发现越来越难以忍受苏联在其国家实施的压迫政策。这导致了苏联阵营的一些重大反抗，我将讲述其中的两次。 +

第一次是**1956年发生的匈牙利革命（the Hungarian Revolution）。一位有改革思想的领导人伊姆雷·纳吉（Imre Nagy）, 要求匈牙利举行不受苏联影响的自由公开选举，更重要的是，要求匈牙利独立。重要的是要记住，纳吉本人是一名共产主义者，并且从未放弃他的理想，**但在这个时候，苏联对匈牙利的压迫非常严重, 且令人窒息，纳吉和成千上万的抗议者认为, 这是匈牙利未来发展的最佳途径。所以当宣布匈牙利将退出"华沙条约组织", 并寻求"联合国"的保护时，**苏联派兵到布达佩斯，杀死了近3000人并镇压了革命。**结果，苏联对匈牙利的控制变得更加严格和压迫。 +

第二次是**1968年对捷克斯洛伐克（Czechoslovakia）的入侵。另一位有改革思想的领导人当选 —— 他仍然是一名共产主义者，只是一个有改革思想的共产主义者 —— 他实施了许多超出苏联政策范围的自由改革。结果，华沙条约组织的军队入侵捷克斯洛伐克，阻止了改革，**并加强了该国共产党中更具压迫性的势力。 +

**也有一些和平革命，主要发生在1989年。**这些革命的动力, *来自于苏联领导人米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫*（Mikhail Gorbachev）, 当年宣布苏联将不再对苏联阵营进行军事干预以支持那里的共产党政府。随着这些限制被取消，例如**匈牙利，实施了自1956年革命以来一直试图实施的西方经济改革。然而，这一次这些改革没有遭到苏联的反对。所以在1990年，匈牙利选举出了一个致力于民主和自由市场经济的政府。** +

到1991年，戈尔巴乔夫的 “公开性”（glasnost）和 “改革”（perestroika）政策 —— 这些政策为苏联引入了更多的开放, 和一些有限的自由市场经济 —— 最终导致了苏联的解体。随着早期苏联的压迫被解除，许多苏联阵营国家民族主义情绪高涨并脱离了苏联，最终完成了苏联解体的过程。 +

So we've been talking about the Cold War -- that decades-long standoff between the Soviet Union and the United States after World War II -- and so far we've been focusing on the tension between these two superpowers. But in this video, we're going to consider the political and economic ramifications of the Cold War. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it.

So as you'll no doubt remember if you've been with me in these last few Unit 9 videos, much of what was happening in Western Europe during the Cold War was intimately tied to the policies of the United States. So essentially, because the United States exerted a profound amount of military, economic, and political influence in the West, it was the U.S. calling many of the shots.

And one of the big moves the U.S. made during this time was the establishment of NATO, or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Because the big bad Soviets were always threatening to expand into the West, NATO was a military defense pact that many Western European nations signed with the United States. The idea was if any one state was attacked, then they were in essence all attacked and would therefore all respond.

Now another big move was economic in nature, and it included the establishment of two entities. First was the World Bank, which was established in 1944 in order to provide loans to countries that needed to rebuild after the war. Later in the century, the World Bank shifted its focus to make loans to developing nations, but regardless, the goal of the World Bank was to make sure that a global economic catastrophe like the Great Depression didn't happen again.

And also in 1944, the International Monetary Fund was established, which facilitated international currency exchange and encouraged global trade. And speaking of global trade, in 1995 the World Trade Organization was created, and this entity was responsible for generating and enforcing a set of rules that govern international trade. The idea here is the same as the organization it replaced, namely the GATT, or the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Both organizations, among other things, aimed to reduce tariffs between member nations so that trade can flow as freely as possible between them.

Okay, so that's basically what was going on in the West during the 20th century. Though there was plenty to complain about with the organizations that I just mentioned, politically and economically the West was doing pretty well. But in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, it was a different story altogether.

Countries east of the Iron Curtain, known as the Soviet Bloc, came under the military, political, and economic domination of the Soviet Union. Their answer to the IMF and the World Bank and the Marshall Plan was the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, and the goal of this organization was to bind Soviet states into a mutually reinforcing economic system which would make them all dependent on the Soviet Union. Their answer to NATO was the Warsaw Pact, which was a military alliance with the satellite states of the Soviet Union, which again would require dependence on the Soviet Union in those places.

Now so far it just sounds like we have similar situations in the East and the West. In the West, the United States led to the creation of many of the organizations that I mentioned before, and in a lot of ways membership in those organizations and treaties made Western Europe dependent on the United States. And that's essentially what's happening in the East as well, except with the Soviet Union. But here's where the comparison starts to crumble. Soviet Bloc nations did not, I repeat, did not flourish economically like Western Europe did, and this was largely because of the Soviet economic model of planned economy.

Now not every state in the Soviet Bloc was communist, but they all had planned economies, and here's what that means. The economic output of these satellite states were planned by a committee within the Soviet Union. This meant that each state was told what to produce, how much of it to produce, and where they could sell. So in that way, states in the Soviet Bloc did not produce for their own benefit but rather for the overall benefit of the Soviet Union, often to their own hurt.

Stalin implemented a series of five-year plans whose goals were the rapid industrialization of the Soviet Union and economic flourishing. And while some of these plans might be considered successful, they came at a heavy cost to Soviet citizens. For example, one of Stalin's five-year plans emphasized the collectivization of agriculture, and this was implemented in the Soviet Bloc state in Ukraine. Many farmers rebelled against the collectivization, and as a result they got blacklisted for Soviet food distribution. As a result, something like 5 million people died of starvation.

Now in addition to planned economies, the Soviet Union -- led by the dictates of communism -- extended social welfare benefits to its citizens. The state provided for many of the needs of the people, including housing and health care. But the state-run services were often poorly implemented. State-sponsored housing, for example, included hastily built apartment complexes which were shoddily constructed and at times required more than one family to live in a single small apartment. The Soviets also provided universal education to children, even if it did include a healthy dose of communist indoctrination.

Now in order to achieve this level of centralization, the Soviet Union systematically removed civil liberties and individual rights of the population. Stalin created huge networks of secret police, both in the Soviet Union proper and in the Soviet Bloc. How you're going to be a ruthless, non-accommodating dictator without a robust secret police? Can't do it. Can't do it. Anyway, they were responsible for rooting out those who dissented from the Communist Party's agenda, and in order to make those threats stick, the secret police were authorized to use violence and subversion to keep the populations in check.

But hey, you know, if anyone got a little grumpy about living in a planned economy where their rights were systematically suppressed, they could just get up and move to the West, right? No. Immigration from the Soviet Union was severely restrictive, and it's not hard to understand why. Communism is supposed to be the fulfillment of all of humanity's dreams, and so if everyone is miserable and fleeing to the West, yeah, it's not the best PR.

Anyway, one of the best illustrations of the restriction on immigration was the construction of the Berlin Wall. So many East Berliners were fleeing to the democratic West Berlin where the economy and individual liberties flourished, so Stalin went ahead and built a massive wall to prevent East Berliners from fleeing to that filthy democratic West.

Now most of the policies I just mentioned remained in place until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. However, after Stalin died, things did get a little better under his successor Nikita Khrushchev. In 1956 when Khrushchev came to power, he publicly denounced Stalin for the authoritarian turd that he was and began a process of de-Stalinization in the Soviet Union. Under these policies, more freedom was granted to artists who, under Stalin, were forced to produce art that only glorified the Soviet Union. Khrushchev released many of Stalin's political prisoners and scaled back the secret police. He also implemented some economic policies that helped average Soviet citizens, like a 40-hour work week and allowing for more freedom for people to choose their career.

Now part of this de-Stalinization program was to ease the heavy Soviet influence in the Soviet Bloc states. Khrushchev made it clear that more civil liberties would be tolerated in these satellite states and that some limited free trade would also be implemented. And when the people of those countries heard this, they were like, "Oh heck yeah!" But unfortunately for Khrushchev, the Soviet economy entered a severe recession from 1953 to 1964, and that meant that none of Khrushchev's promised economic reforms became much of a reality.

So in some of the Soviet Bloc nations who, you know, initially got excited at the prospect of retreating Soviet influence, as the economy began to flag, they found it more and more difficult to tolerate Soviet policies of oppression in their country. And that led to some significant revolt in the Soviet Bloc, and I'll tell you about two.
