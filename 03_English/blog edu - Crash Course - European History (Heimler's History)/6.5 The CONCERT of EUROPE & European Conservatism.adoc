Oh baby, it is that point in European history where it's time to get conservative 保守的. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked Metternich style, then let's get to it. +

Now to understand this distinctive 独特的；特别的；有特色的 rise of conservative ideology 意识形态 at this point in European history, you have to remember what happened before 1815. And mainly I'm talking about trends 趋势；趋向；动向 in the French Revolution. The people demanded liberal 自由的；开明的 reforms of the government, and when the government didn't comply 遵从；服从；顺从, the people went ahead and took over. +

At that point, the people reigned supreme 至高无上；主宰一切, and the people were getting rights they never had before, and they had crushed monarchical 君主制的 tyranny 暴政；专制；专横 under their feet. But then things got a little crazy during the radical 激进的；极端的 phase 阶段；时期 of the Revolution -- more specifically during the Reign of Terror. +

During this phase, surrounding nations had allied 结盟；联合 against France, and those in charge in France, fearing the gains 利益；好处 of the Revolution would be lost, clamped down 强行压制；严厉打击 hard on dissent 异议；不同意见. And you know the song by now -- everybody got their heads cut off, including but certainly not limited to the king. +

And then came along Napoleon, who claimed to embody 体现；代表；象征 the ideals 理想 of the Revolution, and through seemingly 貌似；看似；表面上 endless expansionism 扩张主义 conquered or controlled much of Europe. So after Napoleon's defeat, as I mentioned in the last video, the Quadruple Alliance 四国同盟 -- which included Great Britain, Austria, Prussia, and Russia -- wanted to shut this liberal French machine down. +

After all, liberal reforms had brought about the execution 处决；死刑 of kings, the stripping 剥夺 of aristocratic 贵族的 privileges 特权；特殊待遇, the abolishment 废除；废止 of the church -- all those darlings 备受喜爱的事物 of the conservative order 秩序. +

Now conservatism 保守主义 as it existed in 19th century Europe basically meant this: it was a political belief that argues that governments are most stable when they uphold 支持；维护；维持 traditional and established 已确立的；已获确认的 norms 准则；规范 and cultural institutions 机构；制度. And that's not hard to understand when you consider the conservative view of human nature. +

They believe that humans are inherently 天生地；固有地 flawed 有缺陷的；有瑕疵的 and untrustworthy 不可信赖的；靠不住的, so you can't go putting the power to govern in their hands. Instead, they argued it was better to build your society on institutions that have been handed down 传承；流传 and vetted 审查；核查 -- like monarchy 君主制；君主政体 and aristocracy 贵族统治；贵族统治制度 and religion 宗教. +

It was with this ideology that leaders met at the Congress of Vienna in order to restore 恢复；使复原 Europe to its inherited 继承的；遗传的 structure 结构. Now before I tell you what kind of work they did at the Congress, there are a couple of prominent 著名的；杰出的；重要的 conservatives to whom I need to introduce. +

The first was English conservative Edmund Burke. He argued that authority 权力；权威 and hierarchy 等级制度 were part of the natural order to the universe, and if those are in place, people will flourish 繁荣；兴旺；发达 as such. Burke didn't believe that people were capable of governing themselves, and therefore he believed society should be ordered under a small group of elite 精英；上层集团 leaders. +

The poster boy 典型人物 for French conservatism was Joseph de Maistre. He began as a supporter of the Revolution, but when it devolved 演变；蜕化 into violence, he was horrified 惊骇的；惊恐的；吓坏的. What irked 使烦恼；使恼怒 him even more was the revolution's complete discarding 抛弃；遗弃 of religious authority and the secularizing 使世俗化；使非宗教化 of France. +

To Maistre, a true political authority must be rooted in 植根于；源于 religious and moral 道德的 principles 原则；原理；准则. He therefore argued for a return to monarchy after the Revolution. +

Now after the Congress of Vienna, in which conservative leaders imposed 推行；强制实行 their ideology on the European continent, Europe entered what's known as the Concert of Europe -- also known as the Congress system 会议体系. This is a period of a few decades in which Europe existed in the image of those conservative rulers, and in general there was peace during that time. +

Now this concert was conceived 构想；设想 and driven by the Austrian foreign minister Clemens von Metternich. Those few decades of peace are often referred to as the Age of Metternich. He believed that only powerful central governments would bring order to the various states of Europe -- as opposed to 与…对照；而非 the common rabble 乌合之众；群氓 that disrupted 扰乱；使中断 France in the French Revolution. +

So to that end, Metternich's Concert of Europe basically had three goals: First, he aimed to restore the balance of power 权力平衡 in Europe by installing 任命；安置 legitimate 合法的；依法的 rulers on the various thrones 王位；宝座 of Europe. By "legitimate" he meant old-school 老派的；守旧的 conservative rulers. +

Second, he took pains 费尽力气；煞费苦心 to make sure that European states upheld the rights and prerogatives 特权；职权 of the landed aristocracy. +

And third, Metternich argued for the need for organized religion as the bulwark 保障；支柱；堡垒 of stable states. +

Now whatever you think about those three goals, the Concert of Europe more or less 或多或少；有几分 maintained 维持；保持 peace in Europe until the Revolutions of 1848, and arguably 可论证地；按理说 until World War I came along to ruin it. +

Now remember, a big part of this conservative reaction was against the liberal reforms that occurred during the French Revolution and then spread to the continent. And so for the leaders who engineered 策划；密谋 this conservative peace, they used these principles as a justification 正当理由；借口 for rulers across Europe who wanted to crush 镇压；消灭 nationalist 民族主义的 uprisings 起义；暴动 and liberal revolt 反抗；叛乱. +

For example, in 1819 Austria enacted 颁布；制定法律 the Carlsbad Decrees 卡尔斯巴德决议, which worked to suppress 镇压；压制 liberal and nationalist movements in the German states. The decrees outlawed 宣布…为不合法 nationalist organizations, forcibly 强行地；强制地 dissolved 解散 radical student organizations, and removed liberal college professors from their posts 职位. +

And then over in Russia -- one of the most conservative states of the era 时代；年代 -- tsars 沙皇 claimed to rule by divine right 君权神授. They made prodigious 大量的；巨大的 use of secret police to ferret out 查获；搜出 dissent and used conservative censorship 审查制度 to uphold serfdom 农奴制, which was a little different than slavery. +

== 中文释义

哦，宝贝，欧洲历史到了保守主义兴起的时候了。所以，如果你准备好像梅特涅（Metternich）那样充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

要理解欧洲历史上这个时期保守主义意识形态的独特兴起，你得记住1815年之前发生的事情。主要来说，我指的是法国大革命（French Revolution）的趋势。人们要求对政府进行自由改革，当政府不服从时，人们就采取行动接管了政权。  +

在那个时候，人民至高无上，人们获得了他们以前从未有过的权利，他们将君主专制踩在脚下。但在革命的激进阶段，事情变得有点疯狂——更具体地说，是在恐怖统治（Reign of Terror）时期。  +

在这个阶段，周边国家联合起来反对法国，而法国的当权者担心革命成果会丧失，于是严厉镇压异见。你现在知道这种情况了——很多人被断头，包括但不限于国王。  +

然后拿破仑（Napoleon）出现了，他声称自己体现了革命的理想，并通过看似无休止的扩张主义征服或控制了欧洲的大部分地区。所以在拿破仑战败后，正如我在上一个视频中提到的，四国同盟（Quadruple Alliance，包括英国、奥地利、普鲁士和俄罗斯）想要让法国的自由改革机器停止运转。  +

毕竟，自由改革导致了国王被处决、贵族特权被剥夺、教会被废除——这些都是保守秩序所珍视的东西。  +

19世纪欧洲的保守主义基本上是这样的：这是一种政治信仰，认为当政府维护传统和既定的规范以及文化机构时，政府是最稳定的。当你考虑到保守主义对人性的看法时，这并不难理解。  +

他们认为人类天生有缺陷且不可信，所以你不能把统治权交到他们手中。相反，他们认为最好在传承下来并经过检验的机构基础上构建社会——比如君主制、贵族制和宗教。  +

正是基于这种意识形态，领导人在维也纳会议（Congress of Vienna）上会面，试图让欧洲恢复到其传统的结构。在我告诉你他们在会议上做了什么之前，我需要介绍几位著名的保守主义者。  +

第一位是英国保守主义者埃德蒙·伯克（Edmund Burke）。他认为权威和等级制度是宇宙自然秩序的一部分，当这些存在时，人们会因此繁荣发展。伯克不相信人们有能力自我治理，因此他认为社会应该在一小群精英领导人的统治下有序运行。  +

法国保守主义的典型代表是约瑟夫·德·迈斯特（Joseph de Maistre）。他一开始是革命的支持者，但当革命演变成暴力时，他感到震惊。更让他恼火的是，革命完全抛弃了宗教权威，使法国世俗化。  +

对迈斯特来说，真正的政治权威必须植根于宗教和道德原则。因此，他主张在革命后恢复君主制。  +

在维也纳会议上，保守派领导人将他们的意识形态强加于欧洲大陆之后，欧洲进入了所谓的欧洲协调（Concert of Europe，也被称为会议体系）时期。这是几十年的时间，在这段时间里，欧洲按照那些保守派统治者的形象存在，总体而言，那段时间是和平的。  +

这种欧洲协调是由奥地利外交大臣克莱门斯·冯·梅特涅（Clemens von Metternich）构想并推动的。那几十年的和平常被称为梅特涅时代（Age of Metternich）。他认为，只有强大的中央政府才能给欧洲的各个国家带来秩序——这与在法国大革命中扰乱法国的普通民众形成了对比。  +

所以，为此，梅特涅的欧洲协调基本上有三个目标：第一，他旨在通过在欧洲各国的王位上安置合法的统治者来恢复欧洲的权力平衡。他所说的“合法”指的是传统的保守派统治者。  +

第二，他努力确保欧洲各国维护土地贵族的权利和特权。  +

第三，梅特涅主张需要有组织的宗教作为稳定国家的堡垒。  +

不管你对这三个目标有什么看法，欧洲协调或多或少地维持了欧洲的和平，直到1848年革命爆发，也可以说直到第一次世界大战的到来破坏了这种和平。  +

记住，这种保守主义反应的很大一部分是针对法国大革命期间发生并传播到欧洲大陆的自由改革。所以对于策划这种保守主义和平的领导人来说，他们用这些原则为欧洲各地想要镇压民族主义起义和自由派反抗的统治者提供了理由。  +

例如，1819年，奥地利颁布了《卡尔斯巴德法令》（Carlsbad Decrees），该法令旨在镇压德意志各邦的自由派和民族主义运动。这些法令取缔了民族主义组织，强行解散了激进的学生组织，并解除了自由派大学教授的职务。  +

然后在俄罗斯——那个时代最保守的国家之一——沙皇声称君权神授。他们大量使用秘密警察来揪出异见分子，并利用保守的审查制度来维护农奴制，农奴制与奴隶制有点不同。  +
