So from 1870 to 1914, Europe experienced the second wave of industrialization 工业化. And the second wave was much like the first wave of industrialization, only more so. If you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

So in the last video, we talked about the beginning of industrialization in Europe and how Great Britain was the first mover and shaker 举足轻重的人物 in this respect 在这方面. We talked about the birth of the factory system 工厂制度 which changed the way goods were made. Like, prior to 在…之前 this, goods were made by hand, but now they were mass produced 大规模生产 in factories. +

And now we need to talk about how by 1914, the factory system became the dominant 占主导地位的 mode of production 生产方式 in Europe. And let me give you a couple examples of how this develops. And look, I'm not going to lie to you, there's a lot to digest 理解；领会 in this video. So if you want to grab my note guides 笔记指南 that go along with 与…配套 it, then check the link in the description 描述. +

So first, let me introduce you to the Krupp family in Essen, Germany. Starting in the 16th century, they began manufacturing 制造 weapons 武器. And by the time of the Second Industrial Revolution, they had perfected 使完善 the process of making steel 钢铁. By 1870, states from all over Europe and the world were buying weapons from Krupp Industries, and that led the Krupp family to dominating the steel industry for a century. +

Second, you need to know about the first real industrial city, namely 即；也就是 Manchester, England. It was here that the first industrial park 工业园区 was created, which was a designated 指定的 area built specifically for manufacturing. They specialized in 专门从事 making machines that made other machines. But the point is, Manchester was a city that was built for industry, and as a result 结果, many of its inhabitants 居民 saw their standard of living 生活水平 rise and wealth came pouring in 大量涌入. +

Now you also need to know some of the specific technologies that characterize 是…的特征 the second wave of industrialization. First of all, electricity 电力 revolutionized 彻底改变 the communications industry 通信行业. In the 1840s, an American inventor 发明家 named Samuel Morse invented the telegraph 电报, which was able to send communication across wires 电线 to distant 遥远的 places using short and long signals 信号, which became known as Morse code 摩尔斯电码. +

Eventually 最终 in the 1870s, the telegraph wire was laid 铺设 across the Atlantic, connecting Britain with the United States. And that had the effect of 产生…的效果 further linking 进一步连接 the economies on both sides of the Atlantic. +

Second, chemical engineering 化学工程 led to 导致 improved materials 改良材料 for manufacturing. For example, vulcanization 硫化 was a chemical process 化学过程 that made rubber 橡胶 harder and therefore more durable 耐用的. That was a big deal 重要的事情 because rubber was used widely in factories to make machines turn, and it became an effective coating 涂层 for electrical wires 电线 as well. +

Third, railroads 铁路 revolutionized the transportation industry 运输行业. Now railroads are beginning to show up in significant ways in the first Industrial Revolution, but at this point they began to dominate the landscape 占据主导地位. Remember that when industrialization first took root 扎根, the dominant mode of transportation 主要运输方式 both for raw materials 原材料 and finished manufacturing goods 制成品 was by water -- which is to say rivers and canals 运河 and oceans. +

During the Second Industrial Revolution, thousands of new miles of railroad tracks 铁轨 were laid. This increased commerce 商业 by linking distant parts of a country into a national economy 国民经济. And railroads also facilitated 促进 more people moving from the country into the cities, a process known as urbanization 城市化. +

However, fourth, the internal combustion engine 内燃机 soon grew in dominance 占据主导地位 during the Second Industrial Revolution. Whereas 然而 the first revolution was mainly powered by 由…驱动 steam 蒸汽, the second revolution would be increasingly powered by gasoline 汽油, which is how internal combustion engines ran. Eventually this would lead to gas-powered tractors 拖拉机 for farming and automobiles 汽车 for, you know, going places. +

With all these new innovations 创新 in transportation and communication technologies, new industries developed right alongside of that. The advent of 出现 the internal combustion engine created the occasion for 为…创造机会 the automobile industry 汽车行业. And the most significant mover 重要人物 on that front 方面 was the American Henry Ford. +

Hold on a minute -- this is AP European history! What you doing talking about Henry Ford? Well, I wouldn't be except to remember Manchester, England, that bastion 堡垒 of European manufacturing? Well, Henry Ford established an automobile manufacturing site 生产基地 there and produced cars by the metric buttload （非正式，大量地）. +

Additionally 此外, with the growing use of streetcars 有轨电车 to transport people through cities, which was an industry in and of itself 本身就是一个行业, a new leisure travel industry 休闲旅游行业 began to rise as well. And finally, with the increasing availability of consumer goods 消费品 at low prices, the advertising industry 广告行业 was born. +

And it's not hard to understand why. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, if you wanted, you know, like a chair, you just went down to Carl's house because he was the only chair maker around. But now with so many different companies producing similar goods at massive scales 大规模地, advertising executives 广告主管 had to figure out 想出 ways to make their chair stand out from the rest 从其他中脱颖而出. +

So let's talk about how they did that for a moment. In the last half of the 19th century, industrialization led to a significant increase in the demand for consumer goods, a phenomenon 现象 known as consumerism 消费主义. Department stores 百货商店 sprang up 涌现, which were massive stores that carried a dizzying amount of 数量惊人的 clothing and furniture and toys and anything else a consumer might want. +

Like, a person could spend hours in a department store, and they often did. In this way, shopping became a leisure activity 休闲活动, especially among middle class women of the time. And advertising was a key part of keeping people shopping. And the cycle 循环 went like this: the more advertising went out, the higher the demand for consumer goods. And the higher the demand for consumer goods, the more incentive 动力 for creating even more. And that meant more advertising was needed. And on and on and on. +

Now in the last quarter 四分之一；季度 of the 19th century, both the United States and Western Europe -- two giants 巨头 of industrialization -- experienced what became known as the Long Depression 长期萧条. One of the major causes of this depression 萧条 was the scarcity 短缺 of money during that period. Paper money 纸币 was backed by 以…为后盾 gold 黄金, and that meant that governments only issued 发行 the amount of paper money that represented the gold in their national coffers 国库. +

Because of wars and the increasing amount of money demanded by consumers to buy manufactured goods, money became scarce. And that led to 导致 banks refusing to loan out 借出 money to investors who wanted to build their factories, for example. And this further led to 进一步导致 increasing unemployment 失业 and a global crisis 危机 that was long in correcting itself 长期难以自我纠正. +

And that's just the context 背景 for what you really need to know, which is how corporations 公司 and governments responded to 应对 this crisis. And let's start with corporations. To address 解决 this issue, some corporations attempted to create monopolies 垄断 in their industry. That meant that corporations who could afford to do so bought up 收购 all their competitors 竞争对手. +

And when they were the last corporation standing in a given sector 行业, they could set their prices at wherever they deemed 认为 appropriate 合适的. And usually those prices were always benefiting the corporations and not consumers 消费者. +

On the other hand 另一方面, governments addressed the economic crisis first with protective tariffs 保护性关税. Now a tariff 关税 is a tax on imports 进口商品, and when a country slaps those on imported goods, they do it so that foreign goods will be more expensive and people are more likely to buy cheaper goods made in their home country. And that is why they're called protective tariffs -- they protect the country's domestic industry 国内产业. +

However, when one country puts tariffs on another country's goods, that would often lead to 导致 a trade war 贸易战 in which protective tariffs were used in retaliation 报复. And that was never good for consumers. So some states developed free trade agreements 自由贸易协定 which put the kibosh on 阻止 protective tariffs between those two nations and allowed them to trade without being taxed significantly 大幅征税. +

Now the last piece of this second wave of industrialization we need to consider is the rapid industrialization of Prussia 普鲁士. The reason it's significant 重要的 is because the economic unification 经济统一 that occurred because of industrialization will later lead to 导致 the political unification 政治统一 of all the German states 德意志邦国. But we'll save that juicy bit 有趣的部分 for unit 7. +

Now remember that during this time, what we would call Germany was really just a collection of 一群；一系列 hundreds of states. At this point, the most powerful of those states was Prussia. Now because of Prussia's massive deposits of 大量的 coal and iron, it took to industrialization like white on rice and a glass of milk and a paper plate in a snowstorm （非正式，迅速且自然地适应）. +

They got busy building railroads and metric buttloads of factories. Trade throughout the German states suffered because of political tension 紧张局势 between them. So in order to rectify 纠正 that situation, Prussia engineered 策划 something called the Zollverein agreement 关税同盟协定 in 1834. +

The effect of this agreement was to lower barriers to trade 贸易壁垒 -- barriers like tariffs and customs 关税和海关 -- and thus to unite German states economically. Well, I'm happy to report it worked fantastically 极好地. And with the lowering of barriers, the wealth of industrialization only increased. +

The Prussian government also put in place 实施 something called the national system 国家体系, which was engineered by an economist 经济学家 named Friedrich List. The idea here was that the nascent 新兴的 German industry needed to be protected from competition 竞争 from those stanky Brits across the channel （俚语，带有轻蔑意味，指海峡对岸的英国人）. +

They did this by imposing tariffs on 对…征收关税 imported goods. But there was a caveat 警告；附加条件: those tariffs would only remain in place until their manufacturing sector 制造业 could compete on equal footing with 与…平等竞争 Britons. And by the early 20th century -- spoiler alert 剧透警告 -- they did. +

== 中文释义

所以在1870年到1914年期间，欧洲经历了第二次工业化浪潮。第二次工业化浪潮和第一次工业化浪潮很相似，而且在很多方面有过之而无不及。如果你准备好充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

在上一个视频中，我们谈到了欧洲工业化的开端，以及英国在这方面如何成为了率先行动并产生重大影响的国家。我们谈到了工厂制度的诞生，它改变了商品的生产方式。在此之前，商品是手工制作的，但现在它们在工厂里被大规模生产。  +

现在我们需要谈谈到1914年时，工厂制度如何成为了欧洲占主导地位的生产模式。我会给你举几个例子来说明它是如何发展的。听着，我不会骗你，这个视频里有很多内容需要消化。所以如果你想要获取与之配套的笔记指南，那就查看描述中的链接。  +

首先，让我给你介绍一下德国埃森（Essen）的克虏伯（Krupp）家族。从16世纪开始，他们就开始制造武器。到第二次工业革命时期，他们完善了钢铁制造工艺。到1870年，欧洲乃至全世界的国家都从克虏伯工业公司（Krupp Industries）购买武器，这使得克虏伯家族在钢铁行业占据主导地位长达一个世纪之久。  +

其次，你需要了解第一个真正意义上的工业城市，也就是英国的曼彻斯特（Manchester）。在这里，第一个工业园区被创建，这是一个专门为制造业设立的区域。他们专门制造用于生产其他机器的机器。关键在于，曼彻斯特是一个为工业而建的城市，结果是，这里的许多居民看到他们的生活水平提高了，财富也大量涌入。  +

现在你还需要了解一些第二次工业化浪潮的标志性特定技术。首先，电力彻底改变了通信行业。19世纪40年代，一位名叫塞缪尔·莫尔斯（Samuel Morse）的美国发明家发明了电报，它能够通过电线使用长短信号将信息发送到遥远的地方，这种信号后来被称为莫尔斯电码（Morse code）。  +

最终在19世纪70年代，电报线被铺设横跨大西洋，连接了英国和美国。这进一步加强了大西洋两岸的经济联系。  +

其次，化学工程带来了更好的制造材料。例如，硫化是一种化学过程，它使橡胶变得更硬，因而更耐用。这很重要，因为橡胶在工厂里被广泛用于使机器运转，而且它也成为了电线的有效涂层。  +

第三，铁路彻底改变了运输行业。在第一次工业革命时期，铁路就开始以重要的方式出现，但在这个时期，它们开始占据主导地位。记住，在工业化刚刚起步时，原材料和制成品的主要运输方式是水路运输——也就是通过河流、运河和海洋运输。  +

在第二次工业革命期间，数千英里的新铁路轨道被铺设。这通过将一个国家遥远的地区连接起来形成全国性经济，促进了商业发展。铁路也促使更多的人从农村搬到城市，这个过程被称为城市化。  +

然而，第四点，在内燃机在第二次工业革命期间逐渐占据主导地位。第一次工业革命主要由蒸汽驱动，而第二次工业革命越来越多地由汽油驱动，内燃机就是靠汽油运转的。最终，这导致了用于农业的汽油驱动拖拉机和供人们出行的汽车的出现。  +

随着运输和通信技术的这些新创新，新的行业也随之发展起来。内燃机的出现为汽车行业创造了契机。在这方面最具影响力的人物是美国的亨利·福特（Henry Ford）。  +

等一下——这可是美国大学预修课程欧洲历史！为什么要谈到亨利·福特呢？嗯，如果还记得英国的曼彻斯特，这个欧洲制造业的堡垒，就知道原因了。亨利·福特在那里建立了一个汽车制造基地，生产了大量的汽车。  +

此外，随着有轨电车在城市中用于运送人们的使用越来越多，这本身就成为了一个行业，新的休闲旅游行业也开始兴起。最后，随着低价消费品的供应日益增加，广告行业诞生了。  +

这其中的原因不难理解。在工业革命之前，如果你想要一把椅子，你会去卡尔（Carl）家，因为他是附近唯一的椅子制造商。但现在，有这么多不同的公司大规模生产类似的商品，广告主管们不得不想出办法让他们的椅子脱颖而出。  +

所以让我们谈谈他们是怎么做的。在19世纪后半叶，工业化导致对消费品的需求大幅增加，这种现象被称为消费主义。百货商店如雨后春笋般涌现，这些大型商店里摆满了令人眼花缭乱的衣服、家具、玩具以及消费者可能想要的任何其他商品。  +

比如说，一个人可以在百货商店里逛上几个小时，而且他们经常这么做。这样一来，购物变成了一种休闲活动，尤其是在当时的中产阶级女性当中。广告是让人们持续购物的关键部分。这个循环是这样的：广告投放得越多，对消费品的需求就越高。对消费品的需求越高，就越有动力生产更多的商品。这就意味着需要更多的广告。如此循环往复。  +

在19世纪最后25年里，美国和西欧——两个工业化的巨头——经历了所谓的长期经济萧条（Long Depression）。这场萧条的一个主要原因是那个时期货币的短缺。纸币以黄金为后盾，这意味着政府发行的纸币数量只能代表其国库中的黄金数量。  +

由于战争以及消费者购买制成品所需的资金不断增加，货币变得稀缺。这导致银行拒绝向想要建造工厂的投资者贷款。这进一步导致失业率上升，并且引发了一场长期难以自我纠正的全球危机。  +

这只是你真正需要了解的内容的背景，也就是企业和政府如何应对这场危机。让我们从企业开始说起。为了解决这个问题，一些企业试图在其所在行业建立垄断。这意味着有能力的企业会收购所有的竞争对手。  +

当它们成为某个特定行业中唯一幸存的企业时，它们可以将价格设定在他们认为合适的水平。而且通常这些价格总是对企业有利，而不是对消费者有利。  +

另一方面，政府首先通过保护性关税来应对经济危机。关税是对进口商品征收的税，当一个国家对进口商品征收关税时，这样做是为了让外国商品变得更贵，人们更有可能购买本国生产的更便宜的商品。这就是为什么它们被称为保护性关税——它们保护国家的国内产业。  +

然而，当一个国家对另一个国家的商品征收关税时，往往会引发一场贸易战，各国会以保护性关税进行报复。这对消费者来说从来都不是好事。所以一些国家制定了自由贸易协定，取消了两国之间的保护性关税，使它们能够在不受重大税收影响的情况下进行贸易。  +

现在，关于第二次工业化浪潮，我们需要考虑的最后一点是普鲁士（Prussia）的快速工业化。它之所以重要，是因为由于工业化而实现的经济统一，后来导致了所有德意志邦国的政治统一。但我们会把这个有趣的部分留到第七单元来讲。  +

记住，在这个时期，我们所说的德国实际上只是几百个邦国的集合。在这个时候，其中最强大的邦国是普鲁士。由于普鲁士拥有大量的煤炭和铁矿石，它迅速实现了工业化，就像白雪落在大米上，牛奶盛在纸盘子里（这里形容其工业化的迅速和紧密）。  +

他们忙着修建铁路和大量的工厂。德意志各邦国之间的贸易因为它们之间的政治紧张局势而受到影响。所以为了纠正这种情况，普鲁士在1834年策划了所谓的“关税同盟（Zollverein）”协定。  +

这个协定的效果是降低了贸易壁垒——比如关税和海关方面的壁垒——从而在经济上统一了德意志各邦国。嗯，我很高兴地告诉你，这个协定非常成功。随着贸易壁垒的降低，工业化带来的财富不断增加。  +

普鲁士政府还实施了一个由经济学家弗里德里希·李斯特（Friedrich List）设计的国家体系。其理念是，新生的德国工业需要免受海峡对岸那些可恶的英国人的竞争。  +

他们通过对进口商品征收关税来实现这一点。但有一个附加条件：这些关税只会在其制造业能够与英国人平等竞争之前一直存在。到20世纪初——剧透一下——他们做到了。  +

So from 1870 to 1914, Europe experienced the second wave of industrialization. And the second wave was much like the first wave of industrialization, only more so. If you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it.

So in the last video, we talked about the beginning of industrialization in Europe and how Great Britain was the first mover and shaker in this respect. We talked about the birth of the factory system which changed the way goods were made. Like, prior to this, goods were made by hand, but now they were mass produced in factories.

And look, I'm not going to lie to you, there's a lot to digest in this video. So if you want to grab my note guides that go along with it, then check the link in the description.

So first, let me introduce you to the Krupp family in Essen, Germany. Starting in the 16th century, they began manufacturing weapons. And by the time of the Second Industrial Revolution, they had perfected the process of making steel. By 1870, states from all over Europe and the world were buying weapons from Krupp Industries, and that led the Krupp family to dominating the steel industry for a century.

Third, railroads revolutionized the transportation industry. Now railroads are beginning to show up in significant ways in the first Industrial Revolution, but at this point they began to dominate the landscape.
