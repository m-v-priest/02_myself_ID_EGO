So I'd like to tell you that after World War II ended that all the conflict in Europe ceased and everyone just sat around eating rainbow sandwiches. But no, in addition to all the violence going on in the Cold War, nationalists and separatist movements 民族主义和分离主义运动 sprang up 涌现 and put a kibosh on 阻止；制止 that peace. And I reckon 认为；估计 we ought to talk about them. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

Now if you've been around these AP Euro videos for any amount of time at all, it probably won't surprise you to hear that after World War II ended, nationalist uprisings 民族主义起义 occurred throughout Europe. And I'll mention two of them. But first, let me remind you that nationalism 民族主义 is a feeling of solidarity 团结；一致 among people who speak the same language and share the same cultural history, which often results in those people wanting a separate state of their own. +

So the first nationalist movement I'll tell you about occurred in Chechnya 车臣, which is right here. The Chechen nationalist movement began among a group of Chechen Muslims who live in the southernmost region of Russia. Among this group there was a profound anti-Russian sentiment 反俄情绪 that stretched back over three centuries. And when the Soviet Union fell in 1991, the Chechens declared independence and lived under their own government for about three years. Then in 1994, Russia decided to reassert 重申；再次宣称 its authority over the separatists 分离主义者 and bring them back under their authority -- even though Russia never acknowledged their independence to begin with. That led to a series of deadly conflicts in which over 100,000 Chechens have been killed, and the conflict ended in 2017 with a Russian victory. Since then, Chechnya has been officially part of the Russian Federation 俄罗斯联邦. +

The second nationalist movement to know occurred in Ireland. Now right after World War One, Ireland was split into two separate nations -- Ireland here and Northern Ireland here. Basically, you just need to know that this section was primarily Catholic 天主教的 and the north was primarily Protestant 新教的. The Protestant north wanted to remain loyal to Britain, while the Catholic south wanted to become independent. Now part of the violence that became known as the Troubles 北爱尔兰问题 was caused by the fact that here there lived a Catholic minority, and here there lived a Protestant minority. And in both places -- but especially in the north -- the minority was not granted the same rights as the majority. After a civil rights movement 民权运动 sprang up among the Catholics in Northern Ireland, the British sent in troops to crush the rebellion, which they absolutely did. However, in executing the leaders of this resistance movement, the British only further stoked 激起；煽动 anti-British resentment 反英情绪 among the Catholic minority in the north and the Catholic majority of the south. Violence continued for decades, and in 1972 Northern Ireland came under direct British rule, which would last until 1998 -- a period punctuated with more violence. But the violence largely came to an end with the Good Friday Agreement 耶稣受难日协议 signed in 1998, which granted more sovereignty 主权 to Northern Ireland. +

Okay, now various separatist movements 分离主义运动 also challenged the post-World War peace, and I'm going to tell you about two of those. First, the Basque separatist movement 巴斯克分离主义运动 was a struggle on the eastern border of Spain in this region right here. The Basques 巴斯克人 are a group of about 2 million ethnically homogenous 种族同质的 people who have long held anti-Spanish sentiment. And because of that, they have fought for decades for the right of self-determination 自决权 and political independence from Spain. Now the violent wing of this group is called the ETA. It was founded in 1959 and it engaged in bombings and assassinations and kidnappings 爆炸、暗杀和绑架 in order to draw worldwide attention to their cause and pressure the Spanish government to recognize their independence. Ultimately, their efforts did not gain them independence, and they officially disbanded 解散 in 2018. +

Okay, now the second separatist movement to know is the Flemish separatist movement 佛兰芒分离主义运动 in Belgium. Essentially, Belgium consists of two major people groups -- the Flemish 佛兰芒人 in the north and the Walloons 瓦隆人 in the south. The Walloons... Walloons... anyway, they both speak different languages. The majority of the power and wealth was concentrated in the south. As a result, the Flemish north for most of the 20th century staged movements to either become a separate nation or to be annexed by the Netherlands, with whom they are culturally similar. Now the break has not yet occurred, but the tension has been there for a long time. +

Okay, now let's consider the most devastating 毁灭性的 of the realities that broke the post-war peace, namely attempts at ethnic cleansing 种族清洗. And here we're going to focus on the Balkans 巴尔干半岛. Now by definition, ethnic cleansing describes the act of systematically killing members of an unwanted ethnic group. And this happened tragically in Bosnia-Herzegovina 波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那. Now Bosnia-Herzegovina was part of Yugoslavia 南斯拉夫, which was a nation whose borders were drawn by the victorious powers of World War One. Like, the nation didn't exist, and then the people drawing up the treaties after the war were like, "Hey, let's draw some borders right here just for fun." But the problem was that these borders were drawn without consideration of the various ethnic groups who lived within those borders -- which were significant. Now those tensions and differences didn't much matter under the leadership of Josip Tito 约瑟普·铁托, who ruled Yugoslavia with an iron fist 铁腕统治 from the end of World War II until 1980. +

Now it's also important to know that Yugoslavia was made up of semi-autonomous republics 半自治共和国 which were bound together under Tito's rule. But upon Tito's death, each of those ethnic groups -- under the influence of a strong nationalism -- began agitating for 煽动；鼓动 their own nation, one of which was Bosnia-Herzegovina. Slobodan Milošević 斯洛博丹·米洛舍维奇 was the president of Serbia 塞尔维亚总统, and seeing this disorder, he sought to consolidate 巩固；合并 the various republics under his control. When Bosnia-Herzegovina declared independence in 1992, things got hairy quick. Serbs 塞尔维亚人 were the minority population in the region, and it was Bosnian Muslims 波斯尼亚穆斯林 who made up the majority. So in the name of protecting the Serbian minority, Milošević sent Serbian troops into Bosnia-Herzegovina and carried out what was called ethnic cleansing -- which is just another word for genocide 种族灭绝 -- against the Muslims. Milošević conducted large-scale murder of Bosnian Muslims, destroyed property, and herded the survivors into concentration camps 集中营. By 1995, when NATO nations finally decided to intervene, almost 300,000 Bosnians had been killed by this attempt at ethnic cleansing. +

== 中文释义

所以我想告诉你，第二次世界大战结束后，欧洲所有的冲突都停止了，每个人都围坐在一起吃着彩虹三明治。但事实并非如此，除了冷战中发生的所有暴力事件之外，民族主义和分离主义运动纷纷涌现，打破了和平。我认为我们应该谈谈这些运动。所以如果你准备好获取知识，那就开始吧。 +

如果你已经看过这些AP欧洲史的视频，听到第二次世界大战结束后，民族主义起义在整个欧洲爆发，你可能并不感到惊讶。我将提到其中的两次起义。但首先，我要提醒你，*"民族主义"是指说同一种语言、拥有相同文化历史的人们之间的团结感，这往往会导致这些人想要建立自己独立的国家。* +

我要告诉你的第一次"民族主义"运动发生在车臣（Chechnya），就在这里。**车臣民族主义运动始于居住在俄罗斯最南部地区的一群车臣穆斯林。**在这个群体中，有着可以追溯到三个多世纪前的强烈反俄情绪。**1991年苏联解体后，车臣人宣布独立，**并在自己的政府统治下生活了大约三年。*然后在1994年，俄罗斯决定重申对分离主义者的权威，让他们重新处于自己的管辖之下* —— 尽管俄罗斯从一开始就不承认他们的独立。这引发了一系列致命的冲突，超过10万车臣人在冲突中丧生，*冲突在20世纪17年代以俄罗斯的胜利而告终。从那以后，车臣正式成为俄罗斯联邦（the Russian Federation）的一部分。* +

第二个要了解的"民族主义"运动发生在爱尔兰（Ireland）。*第一次世界大战结束后，爱尔兰被分裂成两个独立的国家 —— 这里是爱尔兰，这里是北爱尔兰*（Northern Ireland）。基本上，你只需要知道，**爱尔兰南部主要是天主教徒，北部主要是"新教徒"。**新教徒占多数的北部想要继续忠于英国，而天主教徒占多数的南部想要独立。被称为 “动乱”（the Troubles）的暴力事件的部分原因是，在北爱尔兰，天主教少数群体, 和新教少数群体, 分别居住在不同地区。在这两个地区 —— 尤其是在北部 —— 少数群体没有被赋予与多数群体相同的权利。北爱尔兰的天主教徒中兴起了一场民权运动后，英国派遣军队镇压了叛乱，他们确实做到了。然而，处决了这场抵抗运动的领导人后，英国只是进一步激起了北部天主教少数群体,和南部天主教多数群体对英国的怨恨。暴力持续了几十年**，1972年北爱尔兰处于英国的直接统治之下，这种情况一直持续到1998年** —— 这一时期充斥着更多的暴力。*但1998年签署的《耶稣受难日协议》（the Good Friday Agreement）在很大程度上结束了暴力，该协议赋予了北爱尔兰更多的主权。* +

好的，现在各种"分离主义"运动, 也对二战后的和平构成了挑战，我将讲述其中的两个运动。首先，巴斯克分离主义运动（the Basque separatist movement）是发生在西班牙东部边境这个地区的一场斗争。巴斯克人（the Basques）是一群约200万的同一种族的人，他们长期持有反西班牙的情绪。正因为如此，他们几十年来一直在为"自决权"和"从西班牙独立出来"而斗争。这个群体的暴力派别, 被称为"埃塔"（ETA）。它成立于1959年，**通过进行爆炸、暗杀和绑架等活动，来引起全世界对他们事业的关注，并向西班牙政府施压，要求承认他们的独立。**最终，他们的努力没有让他们获得独立，埃塔于2018年正式解散。 +

好的，现在第二个要了解的分离主义运动, 是比利时（Belgium）的佛兰芒分离主义运动（the Flemish separatist movement）。从本质上讲，*比利时由两个主要的群体组成 —— 北部的佛兰芒人（the Flemish）和南部的瓦隆人*（the Walloons）。瓦隆人…… 不管怎样，他们说不同的语言。**大部分权力和财富集中在南部。因此，在20世纪的大部分时间里，北部的佛兰芒人发起运动，要么成为一个独立的国家，要么被与他们文化相似的荷兰（the Netherlands）吞并。**虽然还没有实现分裂，但这种紧张局势已经存在很长时间了。 +

好的，现在让我们来看看打破战后和平的最具毁灭性的现实情况，也就是种族清洗的企图。在这里，我们将把重点放在巴尔干地区（the Balkans）。从定义上讲，种族清洗是指"有系统地杀害不被接受的种族群体成员"的行为。这种悲剧发生在波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那（Bosnia-Herzegovina）。波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那曾是南斯拉夫（Yugoslavia）的一部分，**南斯拉夫这个国家的边界, 是由第一次世界大战的战胜国划定的。也就是说，这个国家原本并不存在，**战后制定条约的人说：“嘿，我们在这里划定一些边界吧，就当是好玩。” 但**问题是，划定这些边界时, 没有考虑到生活在这些边界内的不同种族群体** —— 这些群体的存在意义重大。在约瑟夫·铁托（Josip Tito）的领导下，这些紧张局势和差异, 在二战结束后一直到1980年都不那么明显，铁托以铁腕统治着南斯拉夫。 +

同样重要的是要知道，*南斯拉夫是由半自治的共和国组成的，在铁托的统治下，这些共和国联合在一起。但铁托去世后，每个民族群体 —— 在强烈的民族主义影响下 —— 开始鼓动建立自己的国家*，波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那就是其中之一。斯洛博丹·米洛舍维奇（Slobodan Milošević）是塞尔维亚（Serbia）的总统，看到这种混乱局面，他试图将各个共和国置于自己的控制之下。1992年波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那宣布独立后，情况迅速变得糟糕起来。塞尔维亚人在该地区是少数群体，而占多数的是波斯尼亚穆斯林。所以，以保护塞尔维亚少数群体为名，米洛舍维奇派遣塞尔维亚军队进入波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那，对穆斯林进行了所谓的种族清洗 —— 这其实就是种族灭绝的另一种说法。米洛舍维奇大规模屠杀波斯尼亚穆斯林，破坏财产，并把幸存者赶进集中营。到1995年北约（NATO）国家最终决定进行干预时，近30万波斯尼亚人在这场种族清洗中丧生。 +
