== 释义

Now here in Unit 4 of AP Euro, we've been talking an awful lot about the thinky-thinking people （口语化表达，爱思考的人）, what with my previous two videos on the Scientific Revolution 科学革命 and the Enlightenment 启蒙运动. But for this video, let's bring it all the way back down to earth （习语，回到现实）and talk about European society in the 18th century. +

And the main thing to know is that the population of Europe was growing significantly during this period. And so we need to find out the causes of that growth and its consequences 后果. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked （幽默表达，获取知识）, let's get to it. By the way, if you want follow-along notes 随课笔记 for this video and all my videos, then check the link in the description. +

So in the 18th century, the European population exploded 激增. The first half of the century saw somewhat modest growth 适度增长 -- from about 120 million in 1700 to 140 million in 1750. Look, you don't need to remember those numbers. I'm just mentioning them to give you a sense of the scale 规模. +

Then in the second half of the 18th century, that growth rate doubled 翻倍. I know -- during that half of the century, the population increased from 140 million to 190 million. So what's going on? Why are there so many dang （俚语，该死的；表示强调）people populating 居住于 Europe during this time? +

Well, the main reason was a significant decline 下降 in the death rate 死亡率 -- which, if it's not obvious, is the rate at which people, you know, die. So if there's a decline in the death rate, that means people are living longer. +

And thanks in large part to （习语，在很大程度上归功于）the Columbian Exchange 哥伦布大交换 -- which I have talked about ad nauseam （习语，令人作呕地；喋喋不休地）in other videos -- the diets of Europeans became more varied 多样化, and the abundance 丰富 of food available increased as well. Additionally, this century saw improved means 方式 for transporting food, like improved roads and canals 运河 and other infrastructure projects 基础设施项目, and a new means of storing food so that it stayed fresh longer 保鲜更久. +

Also, farmers saw significant increases in their crop yield 农作物产量. By 1750, the surplus food supply 剩余粮食供应 in Europe was at about 50 percent -- which is to say, Europeans had like 50 percent more food than they needed to stay alive 维持生存. +

So food is helping everyone live longer. But another factor was the disappearance 消失 of the bubonic plague 黑死病 from Europe. It didn't entirely go away, but the last major outbreak 爆发 occurred in France in 1720. And with that gone, huge swaths 大片区域 of the population weren't being taken out （习语，被夺走生命）by other people's nasty germs 有害病菌. +

In general, those were the two main factors contributing to 导致 the longer lives of Europeans -- both of which contributed to the decline of the death rate. +

And I know the question that's burning in your mind right now: "What about the birth rate 出生率?" What a perceptive 敏锐的 question, let me tell you. So people were living longer, but were more people being added to the population through birth 出生增加人口? +

So on average, families had about five children during the childbearing years 生育年龄. Well, it seems like it would contribute to the increasing population during this period. Not so much. +

First, that five children per family number only accounts for （习语，仅包括）women who were married. At any given point during this period, something like 40 to 60 percent of the women in childbearing years remained single 单身. So only about half the population was having kids at that rate 以那个比例生育. +

The second reason is that in places like Britain and France -- especially in the upper classes 上层阶级 -- birth control methods 避孕方法 were increasingly being used to limit the number of children born, from about five down to an average of two 平均两个. +

And you might wonder, "What about all those single women? Weren't they having any babies?" Yes, they were. And the unflattering term 不文雅的术语 for a baby born out of wedlock 非婚生育 is an "illegitimate child 私生子". +

So illegitimate births 非婚生育 definitely increased during this period. For example, by 1800 in Germany, a full 10 percent of births were illegitimate. And while this reality may have contributed some to the population growth 人口增长, it was not enough to offset 抵消 the decline in the birth rate. +

Therefore, the real cause in the population explosion 人口爆炸 was longer life expectancy 预期寿命. +

Okay, now we need to take a closer look at （习语，仔细研究）all that new food that helped Europeans live longer lives. And for that, I need to talk yet again about the Agricultural Revolution 农业革命. But first, some kind context 背景. +

Back in the 17th century, agriculture 农业 was on occasion 有时 significantly disrupted 扰乱 by weather events 天气事件, or low-productivity agricultural practices 低产的农业生产方式, and small land holdings 小块土地. And let me give you an example of such disruption with each of those. +

First, a centuries-long weather event known as the Little Ice Age 小冰河期 occurred from the 16th to the 19th century. Now in the midst of 在……中间 this Little Ice Age, there were colder periods which ruined crop yields 毁坏农作物产量 and caused much hunger and suffering 饥饿和苦难. And then there were warmer periods which increased crop yield 提高产量. Well, the 17th century happened to be one of those colder periods 较冷时期, and that led to a lot of hunger and a higher death rate 死亡率. +

Second, in the 17th century, innovations 创新 that we've talked about before -- like the two-field system 二圃制, the three-field system 三圃制 -- were able to keep pace with （习语，跟上）the increasing population. But now, the population was increasing beyond the capacity of 超出……的能力 those systems. +

And third, in the 17th century, much of the farmland available for cultivation 耕种 was contained in small plots 小块土地 owned by individuals 个人所有. And if a family's crop failed 歉收, they were in serious trouble 陷入严重困境. +

Okay, so all that happened in the 17th century. And we're talking about the 18th century in this video. So by the 18th century, with all these new mouths to feed （习语，需要养活的人）, the Agricultural Revolution is going to solve these three problems. +

Now, while historians argue whether or not there was an Agricultural Revolution, several new practices 实践 produced more food for the growing population. +

First, the two- and three-field systems were abandoned 摒弃. Remember that those systems worked by leaving a portion of the land fallow 休耕 for a year so the soil could replenish its nutrients 补充养分. But now it was discovered that planting other nitrogen-rich crops 含氮作物 like clover 三叶草 could replenish the soil. And bonus 额外好处 -- those fields of clover now provided more grazing land 牧场 for livestock 牲畜. And if there's more livestock, there's more meat available for Europeans to stuff into their mouthful （习语，塞进嘴里；吃）. +

Second, during the 18th century -- and particularly the second half of the 18th century -- crop yields significantly increased 大幅提高. This happened to be one of the warmer periods of the Little Ice Age, and so potato and maize crops 玉米作物 -- thanks, Columbian Exchange -- yielded far more than they previously did 比以前产量高得多. And that was especially significant for the lower class 下层阶级. +

And third, more land came under cultivation 被开垦 during this time. New farming techniques and technologies -- like Jethro Tull's seed drill 杰思罗·塔尔的条播机 -- worked best on larger commercial farms 大型商业农场. And so in this period, we're going to witness 见证 the increasing commercialization of farming 农业商业化. +

Therefore, small farmers were forced to consolidate 合并 their land into larger commercial farms because they simply couldn't compete 竞争. The most notorious effort 臭名昭著的举措 here was the Enclosure Acts 圈地法案 in England, which gave legal justification 法律依据 to this large-scale land seizure 大规模土地征用. +

All right, now let's talk about family. As Europeans in the upper classes had children during this time, societal attitudes 社会态度 toward children began to change. +

Now, the prevailing attitude 主流态度 before this is that children were just miniature adults 小大人. But thanks to the influence of Enlightenment thought 启蒙思想, childhood became a distinct developmental state 独特的发展阶段. +

And one of the most significant folks 重要人物 to help foster 促进 this change was Jean-Jacques Rousseau 让 - 雅克·卢梭 in his little book called Emile《爱弥儿》. His goal in this book was to promote the education of children 儿童教育. Because Rousseau believed in the social contract 社会契约论 -- which argued that citizens were responsible for governing themselves 自我管理 -- Rousseau argued that such a weighty responsibility 重大责任 required the dedicated education of children 专门教育. +

Therefore, in part because of Rousseau's influence, childhood became -- at least in the minds of the elite 精英阶层 -- a distinct phase of development 发展阶段 that needed nurture and attention 培养和关注. +

Now, that was not the case with （习语，情况并非如此）the working class 工人阶级. In their family economies 家庭经济 -- whether urban or rural 城市或农村 -- children were needed for the survival of the family 家庭生存. Therefore, children worked right alongside their parents 在父母身边工作 on the farms or in the cottage industry 家庭手工业 or at their parents' trade 父母的行当. +

Now, in terms of 就……而言 the whole family unit 家庭单元, the nuclear family 核心家庭 -- which is to say parents and children, and not the entire extended family 大家庭 -- was the growing norm 日益普遍的模式 and had been since the Middle Ages 中世纪. That meant that once men and women got married, they established their household 建立家庭 apart from their parents 与父母分开. +

However, to do so required no small amount of boom-boom （口语化表达，金钱；财富）. Therefore, men and women in general married later in life 晚婚 -- which is to say in their mid-to-late 20s. And that's pretty late when you consider that the expected lifespan 预期寿命 of a European back then was like 50. +

And the last thing we need to talk about is migration 迁移. Partially because of the technological advances 技术进步 like the steel plow 铁犁 and the seed drill 条播机, fewer workers were required to work on farms 农场需要更少工人. Therefore, in order to find work 找工作, many rural folks 农村人口 moved to the city -- a process known as urbanization 城市化. +

But as this began to occur on a large scale 大规模发生, cities were crushed by the onslaught of （习语，受到……的猛烈冲击）people streaming in 涌入. And that created some problems. +

First, there wasn't enough housing 住房 for all these people. So to solve that problem, a new kind of housing was created called the tenement 廉价公寓. These were hastily constructed 匆忙建造的 apartment buildings which had rooms that workers could rent for a pretty low price 低价租用. However, they were not well-ventilated 通风不好, and there was no indoor plumbing 室内管道设施. +

The poor ventilation 通风不良 meant that airborne diseases 空气传播疾病 like tuberculosis 肺结核 could spread rapidly 迅速传播. And then, no indoor plumbing meant that people had to take their waste 垃圾 and throw it out the window onto the street 扔到街上. So needless to say （习语，不用说）, the cities were stanky （俚语，脏乱的）and profoundly unsanitary 极不卫生. +

And so with all these working poor 贫困工人 crowding into the cities, other urban residents 城市居民 were faced with the problems of poverty 贫困问题 -- like crime 犯罪 and prostitution 卖淫. In order to address these problems 解决这些问题, authorities 当局 passed laws meant to eradicate that 根除问题. A good example is England's Vagrancy Act of 1822 1822年英国《流浪法》, which was meant to crack down on 打击 prostitution. +

== 中文释义

在美国大学预修课程欧洲历史的第四单元里，我们已经在之前关于科学革命和启蒙运动的两个视频中，谈论了很多善于思考的人。但在这个视频中，我们回归现实，来谈谈18世纪的欧洲社会。  +

需要知道的主要一点是，在这个时期欧洲的人口显著增长。所以我们需要找出人口增长的原因及其后果。所以如果你准备好充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。顺便说一下，如果你想要这个视频以及我所有视频的配套笔记，那就查看描述中的链接。  +

所以在18世纪，欧洲人口激增。在这个世纪的上半叶，人口有一定程度的适度增长——从1700年的大约1.2亿增长到1750年的1.4亿。听着，你不需要记住这些数字。我提到它们只是让你了解一下规模。  +

然后在18世纪的下半叶，增长率翻了一番。我知道——在那个半世纪里，人口从1.4亿增加到了1.9亿。那么发生了什么呢？为什么在这个时期欧洲有这么多人呢？  +

嗯，主要原因是死亡率显著下降——如果你不明白，死亡率就是人们死亡的比率。所以如果死亡率下降，那就意味着人们寿命更长。  +

很大程度上要感谢哥伦布大交换（我在其他视频中已经不厌其烦地讲过了），欧洲人的饮食变得更加多样化，可获得的食物也更加丰富。此外，这个世纪食物运输方式得到了改善，比如道路和运河等基础设施项目得到了改善，还有了新的食物储存方式，这样食物可以保存得更久。  +

而且，农民的作物产量大幅增加。到1750年，欧洲的剩余粮食供应达到了大约50%——也就是说，欧洲人的粮食比维持生存所需的多了大约50%。  +

所以食物帮助每个人活得更久。但另一个因素是欧洲黑死病的消失。它并没有完全消失，但最后一次大规模爆发发生在1720年的法国。随着黑死病的消失，大量人口不再因他人的有害病菌而死亡。  +

总的来说，这两个主要因素导致了欧洲人寿命的延长——这两个因素都导致了死亡率的下降。  +

我知道你现在心里想问的问题：“出生率呢？” 告诉你，这是个很有洞察力的问题。所以人们寿命更长了，但通过出生增加的人口更多了吗？  +

平均而言，家庭在生育期大约有五个孩子。嗯，这似乎会导致这个时期人口的增加。但并非如此。  +

首先，每个家庭五个孩子这个数字只包括已婚妇女。在这个时期的任何时候，大约40%到60%的育龄妇女仍然单身。所以只有大约一半的人口以那个比率生育孩子。  +

第二个原因是，在像英国和法国这样的地方——尤其是在上层阶级中——节育方法越来越多地被用来限制孩子的数量，从大约五个减少到平均两个。  +

你可能会想，“那些单身女性呢？她们没有生孩子吗？” 是的，她们生了。非婚生育的孩子有个不太好听的称呼，叫做“私生子”。  +

所以在这个时期，非婚生育的数量肯定增加了。例如，到1800年在德国，整整10%的婴儿是私生子。虽然这个现实可能在一定程度上促进了人口增长，但这不足以抵消出生率的下降。  +

因此，人口爆炸的真正原因是预期寿命的延长。  +

好的，现在我们需要仔细看看那些帮助欧洲人活得更久的新食物。为此，我需要再次谈谈农业革命。但首先，讲一些背景知识。  +

早在17世纪，农业有时会因天气事件、低产的农业生产方式和小块土地所有权而受到严重干扰。我给你举几个这样的干扰例子。  +

首先，从16世纪到19世纪发生了一场长达几个世纪的天气事件，被称为“小冰期”。在小冰期期间，有较冷的时期，这破坏了作物产量，导致了许多饥饿和苦难。然后也有较暖的时期，这增加了作物产量。嗯，17世纪恰好是较冷的时期之一，这导致了许多饥饿和较高的死亡率。  +

其次，在17世纪，我们之前谈到的创新——比如两田制、三田制——能够跟上人口增长的步伐。但现在，人口增长超出了这些制度的承载能力。  +

第三，在17世纪，大部分可耕种的农田是由个人拥有的小块土地。如果一个家庭的作物歉收，他们就会陷入严重的困境。  +

好的，这些都是17世纪发生的事情。而我们在这个视频中谈论的是18世纪。所以到了18世纪，由于有这么多张嘴要吃饭，农业革命将解决这三个问题。  +

现在，虽然历史学家们在争论是否真的发生了农业革命，但一些新的做法为不断增长的人口生产了更多的食物。  +

首先，两田制和三田制被摒弃了。记住，这些制度是通过让一部分土地休耕一年来恢复土壤养分的。但现在人们发现，种植其他富含氮的作物，比如三叶草，可以恢复土壤养分。而且还有额外的好处——那些三叶草田现在为牲畜提供了更多的牧场。如果牲畜更多，欧洲人就有更多的肉可吃。  +

其次，在18世纪——特别是18世纪下半叶——作物产量大幅增加。这恰好是小冰期较温暖的时期之一，所以土豆和玉米作物——多亏了哥伦布大交换——产量比以前高得多。这对下层阶级来说意义尤其重大。  +

第三，在这个时期，更多的土地被开垦用于耕种。新的农业技术——比如杰思罗·塔尔（Jethro Tull）的条播机——在大型商业农场中效果最好。所以在这个时期，我们将见证农业的商业化程度不断提高。  +

因此，小农户被迫将他们的土地合并成大型商业农场，因为他们根本无法竞争。最臭名昭著的是英国的圈地法案，该法案为大规模的土地掠夺提供了法律依据。  +

好的，现在让我们谈谈家庭。在这个时期，随着欧洲上层阶级生育孩子，社会对孩子的态度开始改变。  +

在这之前，普遍的态度是孩子只是缩小版的成年人。但由于启蒙思想的影响，童年成为了一个独特的发展阶段。  +

促成这种变化的最重要的人物之一是让 - 雅克·卢梭（Jean-Jacques Rousseau），在他的一本名为《爱弥儿》（Emile）的小书中。他在这本书中的目标是推动儿童教育。因为卢梭相信社会契约——认为公民有责任管理自己——卢梭认为这样重大的责任需要对儿童进行专门的教育。  +

因此，部分由于卢梭的影响，童年成为了——至少在精英们的观念里——一个需要培养和关注的独特发展阶段。  +

但工人阶级的情况并非如此。在他们的家庭经济中——无论是城市还是农村——家庭的生存需要孩子的劳动。所以孩子们和他们的父母一起在农场劳作，或者在家庭手工业中工作，或者从事父母的行当。  +

就整个家庭单位而言，核心家庭——也就是父母和孩子，而不是整个大家庭——从中世纪起就逐渐成为常态。这意味着一旦男女结婚，他们就会离开父母建立自己的家庭。  +

然而，这样做需要不少的资金。所以一般来说，男女结婚都比较晚——也就是说在他们20多岁中后期。考虑到当时欧洲人的预期寿命大约是50岁，这算很晚了。  +

我们最后需要谈论的是移民。部分由于像钢犁和条播机这样的技术进步，农场需要的工人减少了。因此，为了找工作，许多农村人搬到了城市——这个过程被称为城市化。  +

但随着这种情况大规模发生，城市被大量涌入的人群压得不堪重负。这带来了一些问题。  +

首先，没有足够的住房供这些人居住。所以为了解决这个问题，出现了一种新的住房形式，叫做公寓（tenement）。这些是仓促建造的公寓楼，工人可以以相当低的价格租用房间。然而，这些公寓通风不好，而且没有室内管道设施。  +

通风不良意味着像肺结核这样的空气传播疾病可以迅速传播。而且，没有室内管道设施意味着人们不得不把垃圾扔出窗外，扔到街道上。所以不用说，城市又臭又不卫生。  +

所以随着大量的贫困工人涌入城市，其他城市居民面临着贫困带来的问题——比如犯罪和卖淫。为了解决这些问题，当局通过了一些旨在根除这些问题的法律。一个很好的例子是1822年英国的《流浪法案》，该法案旨在打击卖淫行为。  +

Now here in Unit 4 of AP Euro, we've been talking an awful lot about the thinky-thinking people, what with my previous two videos on the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment. But for this video, let's bring it all the way back down to earth and talk about European society in the 18th century.

And the main thing to know is that the population of Europe was growing significantly during this period. And so we need to find out the causes of that growth and its consequences. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. By the way, if you want follow-along notes for this video and all my videos, then check the link in the description.

So in the 18th century, the European population exploded. The first half of the century saw somewhat modest growth -- from about 120 million in 1700 to 140 million in 1750. Look, you don't need to remember those numbers. I'm just mentioning them to give you a sense of the scale.

Then in the second half of the 18th century, that growth rate doubled. I know -- during that half of the century, the population increased from 140 million to 190 million. So what's going on? Why are there so many dang people populating Europe during this time?

Well, the main reason was a significant decline in the death rate -- which, if it's not obvious, is the rate at which people, you know, die. So if there's a decline in the death rate, that means people are living longer.

And thanks in large part to the Columbian Exchange -- which I have talked about ad nauseam in other videos -- the diets of Europeans became more varied, and the abundance of food available increased as well. Additionally, this century saw improved means for transporting food, like improved roads and canals and other infrastructure projects, and a new means of storing food so that it stayed fresh longer.

Also, farmers saw significant increases in their crop yield. By 1750, the surplus food supply in Europe was at about 50 percent -- which is to say, Europeans had like 50 percent more food than they needed to stay alive.

So food is helping everyone live longer. But another factor was the disappearance of the bubonic plague from Europe. It didn't entirely go away, but the last major outbreak occurred in France in 1720. And with that gone, huge swaths of the population weren't being taken out by other people's nasty germs.

In general, those were the two main factors contributing to the longer lives of Europeans -- both of which contributed to the decline of the death rate.

And I know the question that's burning in your mind right now: "What about the birth rate?" What a perceptive question, let me tell you. So people were living longer, but were more people being added to the population through birth?

So on average, families had about five children during the childbearing years. Well, it seems like it would contribute to the increasing population during this period. Not so much.

First, that five children per family number only accounts for women who were married. At any given point during this period, something like 40 to 60 percent of the women in childbearing years remained single. So only about half the population was having kids at that rate.

The second reason is that in places like Britain and France -- especially in the upper classes -- birth control methods were increasingly being used to limit the number of children born, from about five down to an average of two.

And you might wonder, "What about all those single women? Weren't they having any babies?" Yes, they were. And the unflattering term for a baby born out of wedlock was an "illegitimate child."

So illegitimate births definitely increased during this period. For example, by 1800 in Germany, a full 10 percent of births were illegitimate. And while this reality may have contributed some to the population growth, it was not enough to offset the decline in the birth rate.

Therefore, the real cause in the population explosion was longer life expectancy.

Okay, now we need to take a closer look at all that new food that helped Europeans live longer lives. And for that, I need to talk yet again about the Agricultural Revolution. But first, some kind context.

Back in the 17th century, agriculture was on occasion significantly disrupted by weather events, or low-productivity agricultural practices, and small land holdings. And let me give you an example of such disruption with each of those.

First, a centuries-long weather event known as the Little Ice Age occurred from the 16th to the 19th century. Now in the midst of this Little Ice Age, there were colder periods which ruined crop yields and caused much hunger and suffering. And then there were warmer periods which increased crop yield. Well, the 17th century happened to be one of those colder periods, and that led to a lot of hunger and a higher death rate.

Second, in the 17th century, innovations that we've talked about before -- like the two-field system, the three-field system -- were able to keep pace with the increasing population. But now, the population was increasing beyond the capacity of those systems.

And third, in the 17th century, much of the farmland available for cultivation was contained in small plots owned by individuals. And if a family's crop failed, they were in serious trouble.

Okay, so all that happened in the 17th century. And we're talking about the 18th century in this video. So by the 18th century, with all these new mouths to feed, the Agricultural Revolution is going to solve these three problems.

Now, while historians argue whether or not there was an Agricultural Revolution, several new practices produced more food for the growing population.

First, the two- and three-field systems were abandoned. Remember that those systems worked by leaving a portion of the land fallow for a year so the soil could replenish its nutrients. But now it was discovered that planting other nitrogen-rich crops like clover could replenish the soil. And bonus -- those fields of clover now provided more grazing land for livestock. And if there's more livestock, there's more meat available for Europeans to stuff into their mouthful.

Second, during the 18th century -- and particularly the second half of the 18th century -- crop yields significantly increased. This happened to be one of the warmer periods of the Little Ice Age, and so potato and maize crops -- thanks, Columbian Exchange -- yielded far more than they previously did. And that was especially significant for the lower class.

And third, more land came under cultivation during this time. New farming techniques and technologies -- like Jethro Tull's seed drill -- worked best on larger commercial farms. And so in this period, we're going to witness the increasing commercialization of farming.

Therefore, small farmers were forced to consolidate their land into larger commercial farms because they simply couldn't compete. The most notorious effort here was the Enclosure Acts in England, which gave legal justification to this large-scale land seizure.

All right, now let's talk about family. As Europeans in the upper classes had children during this time, societal attitudes toward children began to change.

Now, the prevailing attitude before this is that children were just miniature adults. But thanks to the influence of Enlightenment thought, childhood became a distinct developmental state.

And one of the most significant folks to help foster this change was Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his little book called Emile. His goal in this book was to promote the education of children. Because Rousseau believed in the social contract -- which argued that citizens were responsible for governing themselves -- Rousseau argued that such a weighty responsibility required the dedicated education of children.

Therefore, in part because of Rousseau's influence, childhood became -- at least in the minds of the elite -- a distinct phase of development that needed nurture and attention.

Now, that was not the case with the working class. In their family economies -- whether urban or rural -- children were needed for the survival of the family. Therefore, children worked right alongside their parents on the farms or in the cottage industry or at their parents' trade.

Now, in terms of the whole family unit, the nuclear family -- which is to say parents and children, and not the entire extended family -- was the growing norm and had been since the Middle Ages. That meant that once men and women got married, they established their household apart from their parents.

However, to do so required no small amount of boom-boom. Therefore, men and women in general married later in life -- which is to say in their mid-to-late 20s. And that's pretty late when you consider that the expected lifespan of a European back then was like 50.

And the last thing we need to talk about is migration. Partially because of the technological advances like the steel plow and the seed drill, fewer workers were required to work on farms. Therefore, in order to find work, many rural folks moved to the city -- a process known as urbanization.

But as this began to occur on a large scale, cities were crushed by the onslaught of people streaming in. And that created some problems.

First, there wasn't enough housing for all these people. So to solve that problem, a new kind of housing was created called the tenement. These were hastily constructed apartment buildings which had rooms that workers could rent for a pretty low price. However, they were not well-ventilated, and there was no indoor plumbing.

The poor ventilation meant that airborne diseases like tuberculosis could spread rapidly. And then, no indoor plumbing meant that people had to take their waste and throw it out the window onto the street. So needless to say, the cities were stanky and profoundly unsanitary.

And so with all these working poor crowding into the cities, other urban residents were faced with the problems of poverty -- like crime and prostitution. In order to address these problems, authorities passed laws meant to eradicate that. A good example is England's Vagrancy Act of 1822, which was meant to crack down on prostitution.
