So now it's time to close Unit 8 and consider the cultural and intellectual 文化和知识的 developments that occurred throughout the 20th century, and baby, they were profound 深远的；意义重大的. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

When the 20th century began, there was a widespread belief in the inevitability 必然性 of progress, which was brought forward from the 19th century. Starting with the Scientific Revolution 科学革命 and into the Enlightenment 启蒙运动, science had solved so many of our collective problems as human beings, and so at the turn of the century, we were basically on the precipice 边缘 of a utopian 乌托邦的；理想国的 civilization. The 20th century is going to be great, y'all. But then Europe went ahead and plunged 使陷入；使遭受 itself into World War One, and all that sweet-smelling optimism disappeared like a fart in the wind. +

Now to be fair, this shattering 粉碎；摧毁 of belief in progress had started before World War One, but it was mainly confined to 局限于；限制于 artists and a handful of 少量的；一小部分 elite folks 精英人士. But once the war began, people could see what all this progress in science and culture gave us. Scientific breakthroughs 突破 in chemistry gave us chlorine gas 氯气 and mustard gas 芥子气, which choked 使窒息 and killed hundreds of thousands on the battlefield. Breakthroughs in mechanical engineering 机械工程 gave us the machine gun 机枪, which mercilessly 无情地 mowed down 扫射；扫倒 millions of Europe's young men. Scientific breakthroughs that occurred in medicine with the widespread use of vaccines 疫苗 and sanitation 卫生设施, but those were just used to send men to the slaughter 屠杀 and then care for them in their wrecked state. +

So the point is, after World War One had ended, that disillusionment 幻灭；失望 about the notion that humanity was progressing toward perfection filtered down from the elite circles 精英圈子 and spread more generally to everyone else. Now it wasn't only two World Wars that had people questioning their beliefs about reality. Scientists made new discoveries during this time and helped people realize that their grasp 理解；掌握 on reality was not as firm as they thought. +

Now remember what a triumphant 成功的；胜利的 moment it was when 300 years prior, Isaac Newton had published his laws of physics 物理学定律, and all of a sudden we knew how the world worked. Nature was governed by immutable 不可改变的 laws that could never be changed. And then remember how great it was in the early 19th century when chemist John Dalton had articulated 阐述；明确表达 his theory of atoms 原子理论 -- how there were these hard bits of matter that constituted 构成 the basic building blocks 基本组成部分 of all that exists. So we finally figured out how everything works, and now we can focus on other problems. +

But in the early and mid 20th century, a group of new scientists came along and shattered all those illusions 幻想；错觉. First was Albert Einstein, whose work helped us to see that time and space are not fixed realities at all. Instead, in his theory of relativity 相对论, Einstein discovered that time and space are actually relative to 相对于 the observer 观察者. In other words, the faster a person moves through space, Einstein argued, the slower time would move. And then came Werner Heisenberg, who built on the work of previous physicists who had discovered that the atom was not in fact the smallest unit of reality. They discovered subatomic particles 亚原子粒子 like electrons 电子, but still everyone believed that electrons behaved predictably 可预测地. But Heisenberg was like, "Oh, that's so cute." What he discovered is that the act of observing an electron with light -- which is, you know, how you observe an electron -- changes the behavior of the electron. So in that way, we have no stinking idea how subatomic particles move because they change based on how we observe them. +

Then came the work of Enrico Fermi and Niels Bohr, both of whom were able to harness 利用 the explosive power of splitting atoms 分裂原子. And that discovery led to the development of the atomic bomb 原子弹, which killed hundreds of thousands of Japanese people at the end of World War II and created a right mess 一团糟 in international relations during the Cold War 冷战. +

And then there was a developing science of people's interior world 内心世界 with the rise of psychology 心理学. We human beings like to think that we act according to our rational nature 理性本质 and that we commonly reason out 推断出；想出 what to do next when presented with stimuli 刺激；刺激物 from the world. Nothing came along like Sigmund Freud, who argued that under the surface, human beings are completely irrational 不理性的. Instead of making decisions based on reasoned analysis 理性分析, Freud argued that we actually behave mostly on unknown impulses 冲动 deep within our psyche 心灵；精神. +

So whether it was our understanding of how the world worked or how human beings themselves worked, the emerging science of the 20th century was undermining 逐渐削弱；破坏 all our beliefs about a certain and predictable universe. +

Also thanks to World War One, a whole generation of those who came of age 成年 during the war were saddled with 背负；肩负 disillusionment. It was writer Gertrude Stein who called them The Lost Generation 迷惘的一代. All of a sudden they felt adrift 漂泊的；迷茫的 in a post-war culture. Values and mores 道德观念；习俗 that they had inherited from their parents no longer seemed to work in the world that the war had created. You can see this especially in the writings of Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. +

Additionally, women experienced a profound change in the 20th century. Hundreds of thousands of women joined the military to serve in auxiliary positions 辅助职位 like nurses and office workers. In addition, because the men had to go off and fight the war, they took up domestic jobs 家庭工作 as well, many of them in factories during both world wars. This newfound liberty 自由 outside of the home led to a rise in the efforts of women to gain the right to vote 选举权. And though it would take another 30 years after the close of World War II for all European women to gain the franchise 选举权 in democratic countries, slowly but surely it did occur. +

== 中文释义

所以现在是时候结束第8单元的内容了，我们来看看在整个20世纪发生的文化和知识方面的发展，伙计，这些发展意义深远。所以，如果你准备好获取知识，那就开始吧。 +

20世纪初，人们普遍相信进步是必然的，这种信念是从19世纪延续而来的。从科学革命开始，一直到启蒙运动，科学解决了我们人类共同面临的许多问题，所以在世纪之交，我们基本上处于一种乌托邦文明的边缘。大家都觉得20世纪会很棒。但后来欧洲却陷入了第一次世界大战，所有美好的乐观情绪都像风中的屁一样消散了。 +

公平地说，对进步的信念被打破在第一次世界大战之前就开始了，但主要局限于艺术家和少数精英人群。但战争一旦爆发，人们就看到了科学和文化方面的这些进步带给我们的东西。化学方面的科学突破带来了氯气和芥子气，这些毒气在战场上使数十万人窒息而死。机械工程方面的突破带来了机关枪，它无情地扫射死了数百万欧洲的年轻人。医学方面的科学突破带来了疫苗的广泛使用和卫生设施的进步，但这些却被用来把人们送上战场，然后在他们受伤时照顾他们。 +

所以关键是，第一次世界大战结束后，对人类正朝着完美进步这一观念的幻灭从精英阶层逐渐蔓延到了普通大众。而且，让人们质疑他们对现实的信念的不只是两次世界大战。在这个时期，科学家们有了新的发现，让人们意识到他们对现实的理解并不像他们以为的那样牢固。 +

还记得300年前，艾萨克·牛顿（Isaac Newton）发表了他的物理学定律，那是一个多么伟大的时刻，突然间我们知道了世界是如何运转的。大自然受着不可改变的定律支配。然后想想19世纪初，化学家约翰·道尔顿（John Dalton）阐述了他的原子理论，这是多么了不起的事情 —— 我们知道了有这些坚硬的物质构成了所有存在事物的基本组成部分。所以我们最终弄清楚了一切是如何运转的，现在我们可以关注其他问题了。 +

但在20世纪上半叶，一群新的科学家出现了，打破了所有这些幻想。首先是阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦（Albert Einstein），他的研究让我们明白时间和空间根本不是固定不变的现实。相反，在他的相对论中，爱因斯坦发现时间和空间实际上是相对观察者而言的。换句话说，爱因斯坦认为，一个人在空间中移动得越快，时间流逝得就越慢。然后维尔纳·海森堡（Werner Heisenberg）出现了，他在之前物理学家的研究基础上发现，原子实际上并不是现实的最小单位。人们发现了像电子这样的亚原子粒子，但大家仍然认为电子的行为是可预测的。但海森堡可不这么认为。他发现，用光线观察电子的行为 —— 这是我们观察电子的方式 —— 会改变电子的行为。所以从这个角度看，我们根本不知道亚原子粒子是如何运动的，因为它们会根据我们的观察而改变。 +

接着恩里科·费米（Enrico Fermi）和尼尔斯·玻尔（Niels Bohr）的研究成果出现了，他们能够利用原子分裂的爆炸力。这一发现导致了原子弹的研制，在第二次世界大战末期，原子弹造成了数十万日本人死亡，并且在冷战期间给国际关系带来了一团糟的局面。 +

随着心理学的兴起，人们对人类内心世界的科学认识也在不断发展。我们人类喜欢认为我们的行为是基于理性的，当面对来自外界的刺激时，我们通常会理性地思考下一步该做什么。但西格蒙德·弗洛伊德（Sigmund Freud）的观点却截然不同，他认为在表面之下，人类是完全不理性的。弗洛伊德认为，我们的行为大多是基于我们内心深处未知的冲动，而不是基于理性分析来做决定。 +

所以，无论是我们对世界如何运转的理解，还是对人类自身如何运转的理解，20世纪新兴的科学都在动摇我们对一个确定且可预测的宇宙的所有信念。 +

同样由于第一次世界大战，在战争期间成年的整整一代人都沉浸在幻灭之中。作家格特鲁德·斯泰因（Gertrude Stein）称他们为 “迷惘的一代”（The Lost Generation）。突然间，他们在战后文化中感到漂泊无依。他们从父母那里继承的价值观和道德观念，在战争创造的世界里似乎不再适用。这一点在欧内斯特·海明威（Ernest Hemingway）和F. 斯科特·菲茨杰拉德（F. Scott Fitzgerald）的作品中尤为明显。 +

此外，20世纪女性的情况也发生了深刻的变化。成千上万的女性加入了军队，担任护士和办公室职员等辅助职位。而且，因为男性要去参战，在两次世界大战期间，女性也承担起了国内的工作，很多人在工厂工作。这种在家庭之外获得的新自由，推动了女性为争取选举权而做出的努力。尽管在第二次世界大战结束后又过了30年，欧洲民主国家的所有女性才获得选举权，但这一目标还是缓慢而坚定地实现了。 +
