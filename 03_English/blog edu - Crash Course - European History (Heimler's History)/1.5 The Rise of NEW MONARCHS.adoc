== 释义

If you've ever seen a movie set during the feudal period 封建时期 of Europe -- which is to say the Middle Ages 中世纪 -- you've probably seen the king portrayed as all-powerful 全能的；权力极大的. "I'm the king and I do whatever I want." But that is not how power worked in those days. Instead, kings shared powers with their nobles 贵族 and to some degree 某种程度上 the church 教会. And if you asked which of those three was the most powerful during the Middle Ages, then without doubt 毫无疑问 it would have been the nobility 贵族阶层. But all that began to change, especially in the 1500s, and in this video I'm going to tell you everything you need to know about that change. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked consolidation of power style 权力巩固风格的知识灌输, let's get to it. +

So in this period we see the rise of what became known as new monarchs 新君主, and what made them new was that they took measures to 采取措施 take power away from other entities 实体 like the church and the nobles and consolidated 巩固 that power smack dab 恰好；正好 underneath themselves. Now in Unit 3 we're going to talk about absolutist monarchs 专制君主, and they're really the ones who are like "I'm the king and I can do whatever I want," so while these new monarchs are not quite to that level, their consolidation of power was definitely on the same path. These new monarchs are going to get more powerful, but they're not yet as powerful as the absolutist 专制主义者. +

Okay, so these new monarchs have more power. So what are they going to do with it? So glad you asked. The first thing we'll consider is top-down religious reforms 自上而下的宗教改革, and just for poops and giggles 开玩笑地；闹着玩地, how about we start with the guy who couldn't seem to stay married for more than five minutes -- Henry VIII of England 英格兰亨利八世. +

Now Henry reigned 统治 during the outbreak of the Protestant Reformation 新教改革（on which more in the next unit）, and he began as a staunch opposer 坚定的反对者 of Protestant doctrine 新教教义. In fact, he so opposed Martin Luther 马丁·路德 on his new doctrines that the Catholic pope 天主教教皇 named him Defender of the Faith 信仰捍卫者 -- the irony of which I shall explain presently 马上；一会儿. Henry was married to Catherine of Aragon 阿拉贡的凯瑟琳 for 20 years, and she was rude enough not to produce a male heir 男性继承人 for him -- at least none that survived long enough to succeed him 继承他的王位. So Henry decided to be classy 厚颜无耻地 and kick her to the curb 抛弃她 by getting their marriage annulled 废除；取消. +

But Catherine happened to be the daughter of the Catholic monarchs of Spain, and they began putting pressure on 施加压力 the pope to deny the annulment 拒绝废除婚姻, which he did. But things got even more complicated when Henry's mistress 情妇 Anne Boleyn 安妮·博林 became pregnant, and again sticking with his classy moves, Henry divorced Catherine and married Anne Boleyn. So the pope went ahead and declared that marriage illegal 非法的, and Henry bit his thumb right back at the pope 对教皇表示蔑视, and that's when the English Parliament 英国议会 passed a law making Henry the head of the Church of England 英格兰教会领袖. And as head of the state church 国教领袖, wouldn't you know it, Henry was positively fine with the divorce and remarriage 再婚. +

Okay, now all that is just set up 铺垫 for what we're talking about here, which is how did new monarchs like Henry consolidate power through top-down religious reform? And here's how he did it. The Treason Act 叛国法案 was passed that made it a capital crime 死罪 to refuse to recognize the Church of England as the official state church 官方国教. Now many English folks remained Catholic 天主教徒, but they had to kind of keep it on the down low 低调行事. +

Now let me quickly fill out 补充完整 the story in England here. After Mary Tudor 玛丽·都铎 became queen and tried to wrench 扭转 England back to Catholicism 天主教（again, there's top-down religious reform）, Elizabeth I 伊丽莎白一世 rose to the throne 登上王位. Elizabeth went ahead and ended the persecution 迫害 of Anglican bishops 圣公会主教 that occurred during her predecessor's reign 前任统治时期 and steered 引导 England back to Anglicanism 英国国教 -- which is to say Protestantism 新教. Now real quick, when I say Anglicanism 英国国教 I'm talking about the Anglican Church 圣公会, which is just another term for the Church of England. Don't get confused. +

Anyway, Elizabeth also consolidated power through top-down religious reform in something called the Act of Uniformity 统一法案, under which English subjects 英国臣民 had to attend Anglican church services 圣公会礼拜 once a week or pay a fine 罚款. Okay, so top-down religious reform was one way these new monarchs consolidated power. +

Another way they did it was by being the only entity responsible for taxation 税收 and the extension of bureaucratic power 官僚权力扩张. Now in case you don't know what a bureaucracy 官僚机构 is, let me just tell you real quick. So the monarch 君主 has the power to tax 征税 his or her citizens, for example. Now how is that monarch going to get all of those taxes? Like is the queen gonna go from door to door collecting them? No. Is the king going to order all of his subjects 臣民 to bring their taxes to his castle and drop them at the door? No. Most people really couldn't travel in those days. So what is the monarch going to do? Create a bureaucracy. This is a group of officials 官员 whose job it is to make sure the people are following the law 遵守法律. So it's the dozens or hundreds of folks in the bureaucracy that are going to go out and figure out how to get taxes from the people into the national treasury 国库. And just to be clear, the bureaucracy is not just a tax thing -- it's there to make sure that all the laws are executed 执行. +

So I reckon 认为 we ought to look at a couple of examples of how this works. In Spain, Ferdinand and Isabella 斐迪南和伊莎贝拉 assumed the throne 登上王位 promptly 迅速地 and began their consolidation of power by establishing national taxes on the sale or exchange of property 财产买卖或交换税 and creating a massive bureaucracy 庞大的官僚机构 which was responsible for collecting taxes and deciding questions of justice 司法问题. +

In France we see similar methods being used -- namely 即 taxation and bureaucracy -- but something specific from France you should know is the Concordat of Bologna 博洛尼亚协约 in 1516. This was an agreement between Francis I 弗朗索瓦一世 and Pope Leo X 教皇利奥十世 concerning taxation and the church. In this agreement, the pope got the right to collect income from the French Catholic Church 法国天主教会, while Francis got the right to appoint church officials 任命教会官员, which restricted their right to communicate with the pope directly 直接与教皇沟通的权利. +

Now the third way new monarchs consolidated power was by assuming the right to determine the religion 宗教 of their subjects. You know, when I say religion I don't mean that some European monarchs were like "I think we'll be Hindu" -- no, the choice was really between Catholic 天主教 and Protestant Christianity 新教. Now a significant document 重要文件 to know in this regard 关于这一点 is the Peace of Augsburg 奥格斯堡和约 signed in 1555. This gave individual rulers in the Holy Roman Empire 神圣罗马帝国 the right to decide whether their subjects would be Catholic or Lutheran 路德宗的, which was the earliest strain 流派 of Protestantism. +

Now monarchs weren't the only ones gaining power during this time. You also saw the rise in power of commercial and professional groups 商业和职业团体 as well, and with this new power they begin playing a greater role in political affairs 政治事务. Now the group you should focus on here is merchants and bankers 商人和银行家, especially in the Italian and German states. In Italy, more particularly in Florence 佛罗伦萨, you should know the Medici family 美第奇家族, who essentially established the banking industry 银行业 there. In Augsburg 奥格斯堡 and the German states, the Fugger family 富格尔家族 established the banking industry there. +

Now the way they were able to gain power was because with the rise of the money economy 货币经济, all that money was flowing through their hands 流经他们之手 because they were the bankers. That fostered 促进；培养 a very close alliance 联盟 between those groups and the monarchs, which allowed these bankers to exercise increased political power 行使更大的政治权力. +

Now the last change you need to know under the heading of new monarchies 新君主制 was the rise of the concept of the secular state 世俗国家概念的兴起. Now a secular state 世俗国家 is a state in which the church has little to no political influence 政治影响力. This new idea began in the fragmented 分裂的 Italian states, and soon the debate would be taken up by 被…讨论 French, British, and Dutch authors as well. In Italy, Machiavelli 马基雅维利 championed 拥护 republicanism 共和主义 in his book Discourses on the First Ten Books of Titus Livy 《论李维》. Republicanism, in case you don't know, is a government structure 政府结构 in which elected representatives 民选代表 make the laws and they wield the power 行使权力 by the consent of the governed 得到被统治者的同意. +

On the opposite side 相反的观点 was Jean Bodin 让·博丹 of France, and he thought the best structure for a secular state was one where the monarch ruled absolutely 绝对统治 -- and not only that, but the kings would rule by divine right 君权神授, which is to say the king ruled as a kind of substitute for God 作为上帝的替身进行统治. +

== 中文释义

如果你曾经看过以欧洲"封建时期"（也就是**#中世纪#**）为背景的电影，你可能会看到国王被描绘成拥有绝对权力的形象。“我是国王，我想做什么就做什么。” 但**在那个时代，权力的运作并非如此。相反，#国王与贵族, 以及在一定程度上与教会共享权力。#**如果你问在**##中世纪这三者中谁最有权力，毫无疑问是贵族。##但这一切开始发生改变，尤其是在16世纪，**在这个视频中，我会告诉你关于这种改变你需要知道的一切。所以，如果你准备好以巩固权力的方式让自己的大脑运转起来，那我们开始吧。 +

**#在这个时期，我们看到了所谓## “新君主” 的崛起，##他们之所以被称为 “新”，是因为##他们采取措施, 从教会和贵族等其他实体手中夺取权力，并将权力集中在自己手中。###**现在，在第三单元我们会谈到**##"专制君主"，他们才是真正说 “我是国王，我想做什么就做什么” 的人，所以虽然这些"新君主"还没有达到那种程度，但他们巩固权力的过程肯定是朝着那个方向发展的。##这些"新君主"的权力越来越大，但他们还没有"专制君主"那么强大。** +

好的，**这些"新君主"拥有了更多权力。那么他们要用这些权力做什么呢？**很高兴你问了这个问题。我们**首先要考虑的是"自上而下"的宗教改革，**为了找点乐子，我们从那个婚姻似乎都维持不了五分钟的人开始——英格兰的亨利八世（Henry VIII）。 +

*亨利八世在位期间正值"新教改革"爆发*（我们会在下一单元详细讨论），他一开始是"新教教义"的坚定反对者。事实上，他非常反对马丁·路德（Martin Luther）的新教义，以至于天主教教皇授予他 “信仰的捍卫者” 的称号——我很快会解释这个称号的讽刺之处。亨利八世与阿拉贡的凯瑟琳（Catherine of Aragon）结婚20年，而她很 “粗鲁” 地没有为他生下男性继承人——至少没有一个能活到继承他王位的。所以亨利八世决定 “优雅” 地把她甩了，宣布他们的婚姻无效。 +

但凯瑟琳恰好是西班牙天主教君主的女儿，他们开始向教皇施压，要求教皇拒绝批准离婚，教皇照做了。但事情变得更加复杂，因为亨利八世的情妇安妮·博林（Anne Boleyn）怀孕了，亨利八世再次采取了他所谓 “优雅” 的行动，与凯瑟琳离婚并娶了安妮·博林。于是**教皇宣布这段婚姻不合法，亨利八世则毫不示弱地与教皇对抗，就在这时，##英国议会通过了一项法律，让亨利八世成为了英格兰教会（Church of England）的领袖。##作为国教的领袖，**你知道吗，亨利八世当然对离婚和再婚没有意见。 +

好的，现在所有这些, 只是为我们这里要讨论的内容做铺垫，也就是**像亨利八世这样的"新君主", 是如何通过"自上而下"的宗教改革, 来巩固权力的呢？**他是这样做的。**《叛国罪法案》通过了，拒绝承认英格兰教会为国教者, 被定为死罪。**现在很多英国人仍然是天主教徒，但他们不得不低调行事。 +

现在让我快速补充一下英格兰的情况。玛丽·都铎（Mary Tudor）成为女王后，试图让英格兰回归"天主教"（这又是自上而下的宗教改革），伊丽莎白一世（Elizabeth I）登上了王位。伊丽莎白一世结束了她前任在位期间 对"圣公会"主教的迫害，并让英格兰重新回到了圣公会（Anglicanism）——也就是"新教"。快速说明一下，当我说"圣公会"（Anglicanism）时，我说的是"英格兰教会"（Anglican Church），这是"英格兰教会"的另一种说法，不要混淆。 +

不管怎样，伊丽莎白一世也通过自上而下的宗教改革, 来巩固权力，这体现在一项名为《统一法案》的法案中，根据这项法案，英国臣民必须每周参加圣公会的礼拜，否则就要支付罚款。好的，所以**自上而下的宗教改革, 是这些新君主巩固权力的一种方式。** +

**他们巩固权力的另一种方式, 是成为唯一负责"征税"和"扩大官僚权力"的实体。**如果你不知道什么是官僚机构，让我快速告诉你。例如，*##君主有权对他或她的臣民征税。那么君主要如何征收所有这些税呢？##难道女王要挨家挨户去收税吗？不。国王要命令他的所有臣民把税送到他的城堡门口吗？也不。在那个时代，大多数人真的无法出行。那么君主该怎么做呢？##创建一个官僚机构。这是一群官员，他们的工作是确保人们遵守法律。所以是官僚机构里的几十或几百个人, 要走出去, 想办法把人们的税征上来存入国库。##需要明确的是，#官僚机构不仅仅与"税收"有关——它的存在是为了确保所有法律都能得到执行。(中国早在秦始皇时期就做到了这一点.)#* +

所以我认为我们应该看几个例子，看看这是如何运作的。在西班牙，费迪南德和伊莎贝拉迅速登上王位，通过对财产的出售或交换, 征收国家税，并创建了一个庞大的官僚机构, 来负责收税, 和裁决司法问题，开始巩固他们的权力。 +

*在法国，我们看到了类似的方法——也就是征税, 和建立官僚机构*——但你应该知道法国的一个具体事件，那就是**1516年的《博洛尼亚教务专约》**（Concordat of Bologna）。这是弗朗索瓦一世（Francis I）和教皇利奥十世（Pope Leo X）之间, 关于税收和教会的一项协议。*在这项协议中，教皇获得了"从法国天主教会,收取收入"的权利，而法国国王弗朗索瓦,获得了"任命教会官员"的权利，这限制了"法国教会官员"与"教皇"直接沟通的权利。(法王对教皇: 要钱可以, 要人事权没有.)* +

**"新君主"巩固权力的第三种方式, 是假定有权"决定他们臣民的宗教信仰"。**你知道，当我说宗教时，我不是说一些欧洲君主会说 “我觉得我们应该成为印度教徒”——不，**选择实际上是在"天主教"和"新教"之间。**在这方面，有一个重要的文件需要知道，那就是**1555年签署的《奥格斯堡和约》（Peace of Augsburg）。这项和约, 赋予了神圣罗马帝国的个别统治者, 决定他们的臣民是"天主教徒"还是"路德教徒"（#路德教是"新教"最早的一支#）的权利。** +

现在，**在这个时期，君主并不是唯一获得权力的群体。我们也看到了"商业和专业团体"权力的上升，凭借这种新权力，他们开始在政治事务中, 发挥更大的作用。**现在你应该关注的群体是**商人和银行家，尤其是在意大利和德国的一些邦国。**在意大利，更具体地说是**在佛罗伦萨，**你应该知道**美第奇家族（Medici family），他们基本上在那里建立了银行业。**在奥格斯堡和德国的一些邦国，富格尔家族（Fugger family）建立了银行业。 +

**他们获得权力的方式是，随着货币经济的兴起，所有的钱都经过他们的手，因为他们是银行家。这促进了这些团体与君主之间非常紧密的联盟，这使得这些银行家能够行使更大的政治权力。* +

在"新君主制"这个标题下，你需要知道的**##最后一个变化, 是"世俗国家概念"的兴起。一个世俗国家是指"教会几乎没有政治影响力"的国家。##这个新思想, 始于四分五裂的意大利邦国，很快法国、英国和荷兰的作家也开始讨论这个问题。**在意大利，*马基雅维利*（Machiavelli）在他的《论李维罗马史前十书》（Discourses on the First Ten Books of Titus Livy)中**#倡导"共和主义"#。**共和主义，如果你不知道的话，*是一种政府结构，#在这种结构中，选举产生的代表, 制定法律，并在"被统治者"的同意下,行使权力。#* +

*与之相反的是法国的让·博丹（Jean Bodin），他认为"世俗国家"的最佳结构, 是"君主绝对统治"的结构——不仅如此，国王将通过"神权"进行统治，也就是说国王作为上帝的替代者, 进行统治。(君权神授)* +
