If you want a recipe 方法；诀窍 for a religious reformation 宗教改革, then the first ingredient 要素 is a saucy reform 大胆的改革. The second ingredient is corruption 腐败 in the church -- you know, something that needs reforming. The thing is, the Catholic Church had both of these ingredients on several occasions 在多个时候 before the Protestant Reformation 新教改革. In the 14th century, you had John Wycliffe 约翰·威克里夫 who was trying to reform the Catholic Church in England. In the 15th century, you had Jan Huss 扬·胡斯 trying to snuff out 消灭；根除 the corruption out of Prague 布拉格. But neither of these reformers had the kind of explosive impact 巨大影响 that our boy Martin Luther 马丁·路德 did, and that's because he had the third ingredient to reformation -- something so spicy 有影响力的 that it would lead to the fundamental altering 根本改变 of the religious landscape 宗教格局 of Europe. That spice is the printing press 印刷机. That is tasty. +

So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then let's get to it. What's that? You want follow-along note guides 配套笔记指南 for this video? Check the link in the description. +

Yes, it was the printing press that created the occasion 契机 for Martin Luther's reforms to actually take root 扎根 in much of Europe in a way that no prior church reformer had been able to muster 做到. One of Luther's main arguments is that the Bible ought to be translated into German, which is to say he believed in the need for vernacular Bibles 白话《圣经》 -- vernacular 白话；方言 being the language of the people. I could see that you have not yet fallen out of your chair in amazement, so allow me to explain why your mind should be blown by this. +

For centuries, the Bible was only available in Latin 拉丁语, and Latin was sort of the official ecclesiastical language 教会官方语言 of the Catholic Church. In fact, if you go to the Vatican 梵蒂冈 today, you can still get money out of an ATM with Latin prompts 提示 -- you know, if that's the kind of thing you're into. But anyway, the fact that the Bible and the liturgy 礼拜仪式 of the church and all the official documents of the church were written in Latin meant that only a small handful of 一小部分 priests and cardinals 红衣主教 and bishops 主教 could actually read and interpret 解读 those texts for the rest of the people who very much did not speak Latin. And so you could see that if only one group can read and interpret these documents, there's an awful lot of power bound up in that ability 与那种能力紧密相关. +

So when Luther comes along and it's all like, "You don't need to be reading the Bible for yourself? So crank up 启动 the presses and print some in German," there's a powerful threat to the authority 权威 of the Catholic Church. And that press for vernacular Bibles spread so that by 1523 there was a French translation of the New Testament 新约圣经, and an English version by 1526 -- all of which were actively suppressed 压制 and opposed by the Catholic authority. But thanks to the printing press, there was no amount of suppression that kept this movement for vernacular Bibles from spreading widely across Europe. +

Now not only did religious reformers challenge church authority, in some places they began challenging state authority 国家权威 as well. And for an example of that, let's head to England. So the Protestant Church of England 英格兰新教教会, otherwise known as the Anglican Church 英国国教会, was established not because the warm fires of reform were burning in the chest of the English, but rather because the diaper baby King Henry VIII 亨利八世 couldn't get the Catholic Church to grant him a divorce 批准他离婚. So he went ahead and established the Church of England and set himself up as 使自己成为 the head of the church and got that divorce. +

However, the Anglican Church wasn't that much different in practice 实际上 than the Catholic Church, and so a few decades later under the reign of 在……统治下 Elizabeth the First 伊丽莎白一世, a group of reformers known as the Puritans 清教徒 rose up 兴起 to challenge those lingering vestiges 残余；遗迹 of Catholicism 天主教 that hung around the Church of England. Now Puritans were of the Calvinist persuasion 加尔文教派, and their attempts at reform ultimately led them into conflict with 与……发生冲突 the Stuart monarchs 斯图亚特王朝君主 -- namely 即 James the First 詹姆斯一世 and Charles the First 查理一世 in the first half of the 17th century. This conflict would ultimately lead to the English Civil War 英国内战 (on which more in another video), and in this conflict the Puritans would come out victorious 获胜. +

Because the Puritans were Calvinist, it shouldn't surprise you that they got so tangled up in 卷入；陷入 the affairs of the state. After all, in John Calvin's Geneva 日内瓦, church and state were almost inseparable 不可分割的. So in both of these instances 情况, Protestant Christians refused to recognize the subordination of 从属关系 the church to the state. However, another group -- namely the Anabaptists 再洗礼派 -- interacted with 与……互动 the state in the exact opposite way. They believed in the absolute separation of church and state 政教完全分离. You know, that was fine until their monarch 君主 started calling them up for 征召 military service 兵役, and Anabaptists steadfastly refused 坚决拒绝 such calls on account of 因为 their religious convictions 宗教信仰 mandated 要求 them to prioritize 优先考虑 the spiritual life rather than their secular commitment 世俗义务. But even with their separatist sentiments 分离主义情绪, you can see it's just another way of saying that the church is in no way subordinate to 从属于 the state. +

So I don't think it's too much to say at all that the spiciest ingredient of the Reformation stew 宗教改革这锅炖菜 was the printing press, and thanks to its power to spread Reformation ideas throughout Europe, both the religious and the political fabric 结构 of Europe fundamentally shifted 发生根本转变. +

== 中文释义

如果你想要一个宗教改革的“配方”，那么第一个要素是大胆的改革。第二个要素是教会的腐败——你懂的，就是那些需要改革的东西。问题是，在新教改革之前，天主教会就已经具备了这两个要素。在14世纪，约翰·威克里夫（John Wycliffe）试图在英国改革天主教会。在15世纪，扬·胡斯（Jan Huss）试图铲除布拉格（Prague）的腐败现象。但这些改革者都没有像我们所说的马丁·路德（Martin Luther）那样产生爆炸性的影响，这是因为他拥有改革的第三个要素——一种非常“刺激”的东西，它将从根本上改变欧洲的宗教格局。这个“调料”就是印刷术（printing press）。这可太有意思了。  +

所以，如果你准备好获取知识，那我们开始吧。什么？你想要这个视频的跟随笔记指南？查看描述中的链接。  +

是的，正是印刷术为马丁·路德的改革在欧洲大部分地区扎根创造了条件，这是之前的教会改革者无法做到的。路德的主要观点之一是，《圣经》应该被翻译成德语，也就是说，他认为需要有通俗语言版本的《圣经》——通俗语言（vernacular）就是人民使用的语言。我能看出你还没有惊讶到从椅子上摔下来，所以让我来解释一下为什么这会让你感到震惊。  +

几个世纪以来，《圣经》只有拉丁语版本，而拉丁语在某种程度上是天主教会的官方教会语言。事实上，如果你今天去梵蒂冈（Vatican），你仍然可以在带有拉丁语提示的自动取款机上取钱——你懂的，如果你对这种事情感兴趣的话。但不管怎样，《圣经》、教会的礼拜仪式以及教会的所有官方文件都是用拉丁语书写的，这意味着只有少数牧师、红衣主教和主教能够为那些不会说拉丁语的人阅读和解释这些文本。所以你可以看到，如果只有一个群体能够阅读和解释这些文件，那么这种能力就蕴含着巨大的权力。  +

所以当路德出现并表示“你不需要别人为你解读《圣经》，那就开动印刷机，印刷德语版本的《圣经》”时，这对天主教会的权威构成了强大的威胁。对通俗语言版本《圣经》的印刷传播开来，到1523年，《新约》有了法语译本，1526年又有了英语版本——而这些都遭到了天主教当局的积极压制和反对。但多亏了印刷术，无论怎样压制，通俗语言版本《圣经》的传播在欧洲广泛蔓延，无法阻挡。  +

现在，宗教改革者不仅挑战了教会的权威，在一些地方，他们还开始挑战国家的权威。举个例子，让我们把目光投向英国。英国新教教会（Protestant Church of England），也就是英国国教会（Anglican Church）的建立，并不是因为改革的热情在英国人心中燃烧，而是因为“小屁孩”国王亨利八世（Henry VIII）无法让天主教会批准他离婚。所以他建立了英国国教会，并让自己成为教会的领袖，还成功离了婚。  +

然而，英国国教会在实践中与天主教会并没有太大区别，所以几十年后，在伊丽莎白一世（Elizabeth the First）统治时期，一群被称为清教徒（Puritans）的改革者站出来挑战英国国教会中残留的天主教痕迹。清教徒属于加尔文主义（Calvinist）教派，他们的改革尝试最终使他们与斯图亚特王朝（Stuart）的君主——即17世纪上半叶的詹姆斯一世（James the First）和查理一世（Charles the First）发生了冲突。这场冲突最终导致了英国内战（English Civil War）（关于英国内战，我们会在另一个视频中详细讲述），在这场冲突中，清教徒取得了胜利。  +

因为清教徒是加尔文主义者，所以他们卷入国家事务也就不足为奇了。毕竟，在约翰·加尔文（John Calvin）统治的日内瓦，教会和国家几乎密不可分。所以在这两种情况下，新教基督徒都拒绝承认教会从属于国家。然而，另一个群体——即再洗礼派（Anabaptists）——与国家的互动方式却完全相反。他们相信教会和国家绝对分离。你知道，在他们的君主征召他们服兵役之前，这都没问题，而再洗礼派坚定地拒绝了这些征召，因为他们的宗教信仰要求他们优先考虑精神生活，而不是世俗的义务。但即使他们有分离主义情绪，你也可以看出，这只是另一种表明教会绝不从属于国家的方式。  +

所以我认为，说印刷术是宗教改革这锅“大杂烩”中最“刺激”的要素一点也不过分，多亏了它将宗教改革思想传播到整个欧洲的力量，欧洲的宗教和政治结构都发生了根本性的转变。  +
