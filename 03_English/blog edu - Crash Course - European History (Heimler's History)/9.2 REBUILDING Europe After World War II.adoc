Oh hey, welcome to Unit 9 of AP Euro. So the Second World War is over, and a lot of Europe is not much more than a smoking pile of rubble 瓦砾；碎石, which is to say post-war Europe is firmly seated on the struggle bus. So how are they going to rebuild everything when they already spent all their dang money on destroying it? Well, that's what this video is about. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked Marshall Plan 马歇尔计划 style, then let's get to it. +

So before we talk about what the Marshall Plan was, let me give you some context 背景. After World War II was over, two global superpowers 超级大国 emerged from the wreckage: the Soviet Union and the United States. And the conflict 冲突 between these two superpowers, known as the Cold War 冷战, will define global events until the last part of the 20th century. Now we'll talk all about the Cold War in other videos, but for now all you need to know is that much of the conflict between these two powers had to do with their political and economic worldview 世界观. The Soviet Union was organized as an authoritarian 独裁的；专制的 communist state 共产主义国家, while the United States was organized as a democratic capitalist state 民主资本主义国家. And each of these powers wanted to remake 重塑；改造 the entire world into the image either of communism or democracy. +

And hey, if you got that National AP Euro exam breathing down your neck 紧逼；威胁 at this point, you might want to check out my AP Euro review pack, which has everything you need to study for and score a 5 on that exam. Link in description. +

Okay, so when World War II was finally at an end, the democratic states of Western Europe were, as I mentioned, in a bad way. Their infrastructure 基础设施 had been destroyed by bombing, and their populations -- especially the male populations -- had been decimated 大批杀死；大幅削减 by the fight. When states and populations are in real economic trouble, they might be sorely 非常；极其 tempted 诱惑；引诱 to give communism a try. After all, under the dictates 规定；指令 of a communist state -- at least in theory -- everyone would have enough food and everyone would have gainful employment 有报酬的工作. But the idea of these Western democracies falling to the influence of communism stank profoundly in the nostrils of the United States. +

So big daddy America decided to get involved in Western Europe's economic recovery. And side note -- if you're wondering why they didn't get involved in Eastern Europe's recovery, it's because much of Eastern Europe was already under the thumb 控制；支配 and authority of the Soviet Union, and they did not want any of that filthy democratic money. More on that in another video. +

Anyway, the U.S. proposal 提议 to help in Western Europe's economic recovery became known as the Marshall Plan, which was implemented 实施；执行 in 1947. This plan allocated 分配；拨出 13 billion dollars in economic aid 经济援助 to Western nations seeking to rebuild. Just in case your knowledge of the 1947-1951 U.S. federal budget 联邦预算 is a little shaky 不稳固的；不确定的, let me just tell you that 13 billion was about 10 percent of the entire federal budget during those years. In case you haven't fallen out of your chair just yet, that is a lot. 10% of all U.S. spending for those years was sent to Western European states for their recovery. +

And I emphasize 强调 that because the first question you have to ask is: why would the United States send so much stinking money to countries that are not themselves? Well, it's because there was a very real fear that if communism began to spread throughout Western Europe, then communism would take over the whole world. So if it takes 13 billion dollars to stop communism, you betcha sweet bippy we're spending 13 billion. +

So the question now is: did it work? And the answer is: yeah, it worked phenomenally 惊人地；非凡地. So in that case, let's have a look at some of the effects of the Marshall Plan. +

The first effect was rapid economic recovery in Western Europe. This massive influx 大量涌入 of American money helped Western European states quickly rebuild cities and roads and bridges, since they now had the money to purchase the raw materials 原材料 that they needed. This in turn got the industrial sector 工业部门 humming 活跃；兴旺 again, and factories roared back to life 恢复生机 to produce the goods needed for reconstruction 重建. In fact, it worked so well that by 1950, European industry on the whole surpassed 超过；超越 its pre-war output 战前产量. +

And perhaps the poster child 典型；典范 of post-war recovery was West Germany. And you're like: hold on Heimler, what's West Germany? Well after the war, Germany was essentially split into two halves, with Western European states and the United States aiding the Western half, and the Soviet Union aiding the Eastern. Anyway, as funds from the Marshall Plan flooded into West Germany, their recovery was so profound 深刻的；深远的 it was dubbed 被称为 an economic miracle 经济奇迹. By 1955, just the Western half of Germany had increased its economic output so much that it was larger than all of Germany's output before the war. Now to be clear, the economic miracle applied to all of Western Europe, but it was especially pronounced 明显的；显著的 in West Germany. +

The second effect was the increased importance of consumerism 消费主义. Now consumerism, by definition, is the idea that the well-being 福祉；幸福 of a nation's economy is dependent on people buying consumer goods 消费品. And those goods included things like cars and washing machines and clothing and darn near 几乎 anything else you could think of. And as a result of people buying more and more manufactured goods 制成品, wages began to rise significantly and the middle class 中产阶级 expanded. +

So in terms of economic recovery in Western Europe, did the Marshall Plan work? And the answer is a resounding 响亮的；强有力的 uh-huh. +

哦，嘿，欢迎来到AP欧洲史的第9单元。第二次世界大战结束了，欧洲的很多地方成了一片废墟，也就是说，战后的欧洲深陷困境。既然他们把钱都花在战争破坏上了，那他们要怎么重建一切呢？嗯，这就是这个视频要讲的内容。所以，如果你准备好以“马歇尔计划”（Marshall Plan）的视角来获取知识，那就开始吧。 +

在我们谈论马歇尔计划是什么之前，我先给你们讲讲背景。第二次世界大战结束后，从战争废墟中崛起了两个全球超级大国：苏联（the Soviet Union）和美国（the United States）。这两个超级大国之间的冲突，也就是所谓的“冷战”（the Cold War），将影响着全球局势，这种影响一直持续到20世纪后期。我们会在其他视频里详细谈论冷战，但现在你们只需要知道，这两个大国之间的冲突很大程度上与它们的政治和经济世界观有关。苏联是一个专制的共产主义国家，而美国是一个民主的资本主义国家。这两个大国都想把整个世界改造成符合自己的样子，要么是共产主义模式，要么是民主模式。 +

嘿，如果全国AP欧洲史考试已经迫在眉睫，你可能想看看我的AP欧洲史复习资料包，它包含了你备考所需的一切，能让你在考试中得5分。简介里有链接。 +

好的，所以当第二次世界大战最终结束时，正如我提到的，西欧的民主国家处境艰难。它们的基础设施被轰炸破坏了，人口，尤其是男性人口，在战争中大量减少。当国家和民众陷入严重的经济困境时，他们可能会非常想尝试共产主义。毕竟，在共产主义国家的体制下，至少从理论上来说，每个人都能有足够的食物，每个人都能有一份有收入的工作。但这些西欧民主国家受到共产主义影响的想法，让美国非常反感。 +

所以美国这个“老大哥”决定参与西欧的经济复苏。顺便说一下，如果你想知道为什么他们不参与东欧的经济复苏，那是因为东欧的大部分地区已经在苏联的控制之下，而且东欧地区也不想要美国那些“肮脏”的民主资金。我们会在另一个视频里详细讲这个。 +

不管怎样，美国提出的帮助西欧经济复苏的计划被称为马歇尔计划，该计划于1947年实施。这个计划为寻求重建的西欧国家分配了130亿美元的经济援助。如果你对1947年至1951年美国联邦预算不太了解，我告诉你，130亿美元大约占那些年美国联邦预算的10%。如果你还没被这个数字震惊到，我告诉你，这是一笔巨款。美国那些年支出的10%都被用于西欧国家的经济复苏。 +

我强调这一点是因为你首先要问的问题是：为什么美国要把这么多钱送给其他国家呢？嗯，这是因为人们非常担心，如果共产主义开始在西欧蔓延，那么共产主义就会接管整个世界。所以，如果花130亿美元能阻止共产主义，那肯定得花这笔钱。 +

那么现在的问题是：这个计划奏效了吗？答案是：是的，效果非常显著。所以在这种情况下，我们来看看马歇尔计划的一些影响。 +

第一个影响是西欧经济的快速复苏。美国大量资金的涌入帮助西欧国家迅速重建城市、道路和桥梁，因为它们现在有钱购买所需的原材料。这反过来又让工业部门重新活跃起来，工厂恢复生产，制造重建所需的商品。事实上，这个计划效果非常好，到1950年，整个欧洲的工业产出超过了战前水平。 +

战后复苏的典型代表是西德（West Germany）。你可能会问：等等，海姆勒，西德是什么？嗯，战后德国基本上被分成了两半，西欧国家和美国援助西德，而苏联援助东德。不管怎样，随着马歇尔计划的资金涌入西德，西德的复苏非常显著，被称为“经济奇迹”。到1955年，仅西德的经济产出就大幅增长，超过了战前整个德国的产出。需要明确的是，经济奇迹适用于整个西欧，但在西德尤为明显。 +

第二个影响是消费主义的重要性日益增加。从定义上来说，消费主义认为一个国家的经济状况取决于人们购买消费品。这些消费品包括汽车、洗衣机、服装以及几乎你能想到的所有东西。由于人们购买的制成品越来越多，工资大幅上涨，中产阶级也在扩大。 +

所以，就西欧的经济复苏而言，马歇尔计划奏效了吗？答案是：那当然。 +
