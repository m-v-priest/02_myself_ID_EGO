All right, we've already established that the Industrial Revolution was a major force of change in the world. But for a lot of people, that change was for the worse. So in this video, we need to talk about all the reforms in the 19th century that attempted to make those people's lives a little less miserable 悲惨的；痛苦的. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

So in response to the social woes 灾难；困苦 created by industrialization, some Europeans turned to 求助于 politics and political parties to create meaningful reform and to make their lives feel more fulfilling 令人满足的 and less like a recently expired 过期的 coupon 优惠券. And that brings us to the rise of mass-based 群众基础的 political parties. +

Now political parties weren't necessarily new at this point, but what was new was mass-based political parties. You see, as European nations extended 扩大；扩展 the right to vote to more and more people, political parties had to appeal to 吸引；呼吁 more voters' interests in order to win office. +

For example, in England, the Conservative Party 保守党 really only cared about the interests of the landed elite 土地贵族, but the Liberal Party 自由党 increasingly represented 代表 the interests of the working class. And so as more and more of the working class gained the right to vote, the Liberal Party grew in influence and power. +

In the 19th century, the people of England turned to the Liberal Party to enact 颁布；制定法律 policies for a national education system and public health benefits. +

Another example of people attempting reform through political parties was Germany's Social Democratic Party 德国社会民主党. This party was built on Marxist 马克思主义的 principles of class struggle 阶级斗争 and worked to improve the lives of the German working class. +

Now remember what we talked about in another video when we dealt with Marx's understanding of history. He believed that class struggle would eventually result in 导致；造成 a violent revolution. There were Germans in the Social Democratic Party who believed revolution was inevitable 不可避免的, but there was another faction 派别；派系 that believed that class struggle could be alleviated 减轻；缓和 by social reform. +

And they were able to make some modest 适度的；些许的 gains for the working class -- not least improved standards of living and working conditions. +

Now during this time, workers also joined together in labor unions 工会, which promoted 推动；促进 social and economic reforms. And some of these even turned into political parties themselves. And this was especially prominent 显著的；突出的 in England. +

After 1870, labor unions gained the right to strike 罢工. And when they gained the right to strike -- well, they struck. In 1888, female workers organized a strike in the match industry. And in 1889, London dock workers did the same. +

By the time World War I rolled around, somewhere around three to four million workers had organized themselves into labor unions in England. And this became one of the primary 主要的 ways that workers agitated for 鼓动；煽动 reforms to their wages and their working conditions. +

Now in the previous point, we talked about the Social Democratic Party in Germany. But before this was a political party, it was two independent labor unions -- namely 即；也就是 the General German Workers' Association 全德工人联合会 and the Social Democratic Workers' Party 社会民主工人党. +

Now it's not as important to remember the names of those individual unions as it is to remember that these labor unions merged 合并；融合 to form a political party that worked for the rights of the working class. +

Now women also pressed for 争取；施压 legal, economic, and political rights as well as improved working conditions. This came about 发生；产生 in part because women of this age were exceedingly 极其；非常 involved in broader reform movements that gave them the motivation 动力；动机 to begin questioning their own roles in society. +

For example, Barbara Smith Bodichon in England gathered a group of women together who became known as the Ladies of Langham Place. They worked together to extend voting rights to women and to recognize 承认 women's rights to property apart from their husbands. +

We talked about Flora Tristan in another video, but by way of reminder, she worked for women's equality in France. And since she was a utopian socialist 空想社会主义者, her ideas didn't really seem workable 可行的 in the real world, and thus her ideas remained confined to 局限于 the margins of society. +

But building on 以…为基础 Tristan's work, the Women's Social and Political Union 妇女社会政治联盟 emerged in Britain in the early 20th century. It was created by the Pankhurst family, who organized mass rallies 大规模集会 for women's equality. +

The most significant rally for women's suffrage 妇女选举权 occurred in 1908 in London's Hyde Park. In response, police attacked the demonstrators 示威者 and jailed no small number. But the Pankhursts continued fighting for women's suffrage -- a fight that eventually pressured Britain's Liberal Party to add that issue to their platform 纲领；政纲. +

As a result, in 1888, the British Parliament 议会 passed a law enabling men over 21 to vote and women over the age of 30 to vote. So yeah, baby steps 循序渐进的努力. +

Additionally, let's talk about people who sought to reform society based on their religious principles. One of the most notable 显著的；著名的 was the Sunday School movement 主日学校运动, which aimed to provide education for working-class children. And most of the teaching was done by women. +

The movement was a massive success. And as adults brought their children to learn reading, writing, and arithmetic 算术, the adults themselves learned too -- all leading to a more literate 有文化的；有读写能力的 and empowered 获得权力的；被赋予权力的 society. +

Additionally, the abolitionist movement 废奴运动 sought to ban slavery. This movement had the most success in England, where, growing out of 源于；起因于 the abolitionist work of William Wilberforce, by 1838 slavery was abolished 废除 across the British Empire. +

== 中文释义

好的，我们已经确定"工业革命"是世界变革的主要力量。但对于很多人来说，这种变革让情况变得更糟。所以在这个视频中，我们需要谈谈19世纪的所有改革，这些改革试图让那些人的生活不那么悲惨。所以，如果你准备好充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

**#为了应对"工业化"带来的社会问题，一些欧洲人转向政治和政党，希望进行有意义的改革，#**让他们的生活更充实，而不是像一张刚刚过期的优惠券那样毫无价值。*这就引出了群众基础政党的兴起。*  +

*#在这个时期，政党本身并不是什么新鲜事物，但"基于群众基础的政党"却是新出现的。你看，随着欧洲国家将选举权扩大到越来越多的人，政党为了赢得执政地位，不得不迎合更多选民的利益。#*  +

例如，*在英国，保守党（Conservative Party）实际上只关心土地贵族的利益，而自由党（Liberal Party）则越来越多地代表工人阶级的利益。所以，随着越来越多的工人阶级获得选举权，自由党的影响力和权力也在增长。*  +

在19世纪，英国人民依靠自由党, 来制定国家教育体系和公共卫生福利方面的政策。  +

人们通过"政党"进行改革的另一个例子, 是德国的"社会民主党"（Social Democratic Party）。这个政党建立在马克思的阶级斗争原则之上，致力于改善德国工人阶级的生活。  +

还记得我们在另一个视频中谈到的马克思对历史的理解吗？他认为"阶级斗争"最终会导致一场暴力革命。*德国"社会民主党"中的一些人认为, 革命是不可避免的，但另一个派别则认为, 阶级斗争可以通过社会改革得到缓解。*  +

他们为工人阶级取得了一些适度的成果——至少改善了生活和工作条件。  +

在这个时期，工人们还联合起来成立了"工会"（labor unions），推动社会和经济改革。*其中一些工会甚至自身转变为政党(工党)。这在英国尤为突出。*  +

**1870年之后，工会获得了罢工的权利。**当他们获得罢工权利后——嗯，他们就举行了罢工。1888年，女工们在火柴行业组织了一次罢工。1889年，伦敦码头工人也进行了罢工。  +

到"第一次世界大战"爆发时，英国大约有三四百万工人加入了工会。这成为工人们争取工资和工作条件改革的主要方式之一。  +

之前我们谈到了德国的社会民主党。但在它成为一个政党之前，它是两个独立的工会——即德国工人总协会（General German Workers' Association）和社会民主工人党（Social Democratic Workers' Party）。  +

记住这些单个工会的名字并不那么重要，重要的是要记住**这些工会合并成了一个为工人阶级争取权利的政党。**  +

**女性也为争取法律、经济和政治权利以, 及改善工作条件而努力。**这在一定程度上是因为, 这个时代的女性大量参与了更广泛的改革运动，这让她们有动力开始质疑自己在社会中的角色。  +

例如，英国的芭芭拉·史密斯·博迪雄（Barbara Smith Bodichon）召集了一群女性，她们被称为兰厄姆广场的女士们（the Ladies of Langham Place）。她们共同努力，争取将选举权扩大到女性，并认可女性独立于丈夫的财产权。  +

我们在另一个视频中谈到了弗洛拉·特里斯坦（Flora Tristan），但提醒一下，她在法国为女性平等而努力。*由于她是一个"空想社会主义者"，她的想法在现实世界中并不太可行，因此她的想法仍然处于社会的边缘。*  +

但在特里斯坦工作的基础上，妇女社会政治联盟（Women's Social and Political Union）于20世纪初在英国成立。它由潘克赫斯特（Pankhurst）家族创建，该家族组织了大规模的争取女性平等的集会。  +

争取女性选举权的最重大集会, 于1908年在伦敦的海德公园（Hyde Park）举行。作为回应，警察攻击了示威者，并监禁了不少人。但**潘克赫斯特家族继续为女性选举权而斗争——这场斗争最终迫使英国"自由党"将这个问题纳入他们的纲领。**  +

**结果，1918年，英国议会通过了一项法律，使21岁以上的男性, 和30岁以上的女性, 获得了选举权。**所以，这是渐进的进步。  +

此外，让我们谈谈**那些基于宗教原则, 寻求社会改革的人。其中最著名的是"主日学校运动"（the Sunday School movement），该运动旨在为工人阶级的孩子提供教育。大部分教学工作是由女性完成的。(欧洲各个政治团体, 为各人民子集(工人, 女人, 儿童等)争取各种权益的运动, 风起云涌. 多亏了他们的努力, 很多权益才都成功实现了. 中国呢? 有多空白?)**  +

这项运动取得了巨大的成功。当成年人带着他们的孩子去学习阅读、写作和算术时，成年人自己也在学习——这一切都促进了一个文化水平更高、更有能力的社会的形成。  +

此外，废奴运动（abolitionist movement）致力于废除奴隶制。这项运动在英国最为成功，在威廉·威尔伯福斯（William Wilberforce）的废奴工作基础上，到1838年，奴隶制在大英帝国被废除。  +
