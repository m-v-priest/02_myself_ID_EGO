Oh my goodness, it is the last video of the entire AP Euro curriculum. But I'll tell you goodbye and shed a single tear at the end of the video. For now, we need to talk about the 20th and the 21st century culture, arts, and demographic trends 人口趋势. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked one last time, let's get to it. +

Now if you remember all the way back to Unit 8, I mentioned that before World War One everyone was like "science!", but after World War One everyone was like "science?" You see, for centuries science was dominated by a narrative 叙述；故事 of progress -- the world is getting better and better because of our scientific progress. And at the turn of the 20th century, humanity 人类 was about to enter a perfect world thanks to science. That illusion 幻想；错觉 had been destroyed on the battlefields of both World Wars. Scientific progress could be used to destroy huge swaths 大片；大量 of humanity. So the result of both of those world wars was a decreased confidence that science could solve all our problems. +

And so the philosophy 哲学 of the age began to reflect this disillusionment 幻灭；失望 with the world and engendered 产生；引起 a strong reaction against Enlightenment rationalism 启蒙理性主义. The first development came in the rise of existentialism 存在主义. This is a philosophy that assumed 假定；认为 the world was absurd 荒谬的 and that meaning had to be found in spite of that absurdity 荒谬. Friedrich Nietzsche was kind of the poster boy 典型人物 for this manner of thinking. His reckoning 观点；估计: God was dead and Europeans had killed him, and thus now that God was dead, life was inherently 本质上 meaningless. +

Okay, now the second development came along in the 1950s and it was called postmodernism 后现代主义. It reacted against Enlightenment certainty 确定性 by pointing out that all truth was relative 相对的. In other words, every different culture has unique ways of seeing the world and values by which it interacts with the world. Therefore, postmodern philosophers 哲学家 would say that no one culture or one thinker has the corner on absolute truth 绝对真理 because all truth claims are culturally conditioned 受文化制约的. +

So in both these philosophical developments, you can see that the old Enlightenment rationalism was no longer reigning supreme 占主导地位. But that shouldn't tempt you to believe that Europeans were throwing away their religion left, right, and center. It is true that Europe grew more secular 世俗的 over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries, but it is also true that organized religion 有组织的宗教 continued to play a significant role in European social and cultural life in spite of the many challenges it faced. +

For example, in the 20th century the church had to contend with 应对；处理 totalitarian governments 极权政府, and their responses were mixed. In Germany, Dietrich Bonhoeffer founded the Confessing Church 认信教会 which was exceedingly 非常 vocal in its criticism of Nazi policies, especially their anti-Jewish policy 反犹政策. But for his suspected participation in an assassination attempt against Hitler, Bonhoeffer was executed 处决 in the waning days of the war. +

But it was a different story over in Italy. When Mussolini rose to power, he understood that he needed the support of the Catholic Church in Rome. So he recognized the independence of Vatican City 梵蒂冈城 and proclaimed Catholicism 天主教 as the official religion of Italy. In response, the pope encouraged the faithful 信徒 to support the fascist government 法西斯政府. +

Over in Poland, the church had to contend with Soviet communist repression 苏联共产主义的镇压. In 1980, a group known as Solidarity 团结工会 was founded, which was essentially a Polish trade union 波兰工会 that existed outside Warsaw. The Soviets tried their hardest to crush this opposition 反对派 but could not. And in 1978, a Catholic cardinal 红衣主教 from Poland was elected pope of the Catholic Church, taking the name John Paul II. Being sympathetic with the goals of Solidarity, the pope financially supported their efforts to undermine the Soviet communist regime in Poland. +

So those are a couple examples of how the church responded to totalitarianism 极权主义. But since we're talking about religion, I need to tell you that the Catholic Church underwent a massive reform movement in the 1960s at the Second Vatican Council 第二次梵蒂冈大公会议. You'll also hear this called Vatican II, but you know it's the same thing -- don't get confused. The purpose of this council was essentially to update the church to respond to the modern world. One of the most significant changes was the allowance of priests to say the mass 做弥撒 in vernacular languages 本国语言 rather than in Latin. Additionally, the church made resolutions 决议 to live on friendlier terms with other sects of Christianity 基督教教派, namely Protestants 新教徒 and Eastern Orthodox Christians 东正教基督徒. Ultimately these sweeping reforms 全面改革 led to a revival 复兴 of Catholicism in various parts of Europe. +

Now I already mentioned how philosophy and science were leading the way in questioning and undermining objective knowledge 客观知识 during the 20th century. The arts followed that same path as well. Remember in Unit 7 we talked about the rise of cubism 立体主义 around the turn of the 20th century. In this movement, the subject of the paintings became almost nonsensical 无意义的. It was a style that depicted 描绘 three-dimensional objects 三维物体 in two dimensions 二维. Pablo Picasso was probably the most famous of these artists. +

And then came the Italian and Russian artistic movement known as futurism 未来主义, in which artists emphasized 强调 -- you know -- the future. They emphasized the future of Italy and Russia in order to free them from their recently checkered past 动荡的过去. For example, here's a painting from the Russian futurist Natalia Goncharova, and you can see the finger pointing backwards while the cyclist defiantly 大胆地 pedals into the future. +

Then came Dadaism 达达主义, which was a response to the felt purposelessness 无目的性 of life after two world wars had devastated 摧毁 the European continent. If life was devoid of purpose 缺乏目的, so too should art be devoid of purpose. Case in point 例证: Marcel Duchamp's famous Dada piece called Fountain. If you're thinking "Wait, that's just a urinal 小便池 -- that's not art," exactly! It is a satirical 讽刺性的 commentary on the meaninglessness of Western aesthetic values 西方美学价值. +

Then came the artistic movement known as surrealism 超现实主义. The idea here is that as Sigmund Freud had exposed the chaotic 混乱的 and unrefined 未提炼的；粗俗的 interior worlds of human beings, art ought to reflect those same realities. For example, the most famous of the surrealists was Salvador Dalí, and here you can see his painting called The Persistence of Memory 记忆的永恒. I mean this looks like something out of a dreamscape 梦境. And apparently he meant the melting clocks would be a kind of commentary on the disturbing relativity of time. +

But it wasn't only the visual arts that changed over the course of the 20th century. So too did architecture 建筑. For example, the Bauhaus School of Architecture 包豪斯建筑学派 emerged in Germany during the interwar years 两次世界大战之间的时期. Their goal was to design structures based on their function 功能 and to focus not on useless conventions of form 形式上无用的惯例. And so you can see here that their buildings lacked ornamentation 装饰 but instead looked like boxes of steel and glass. +

And literature 文学 also got caught up in the changes as well. As you might expect by this point, writers began challenging the forms that had been handed down. The Irish novelist James Joyce made popular a new form of composition 创作形式 called stream of consciousness 意识流. The idea here was to reproduce on the page a character's actual thoughts, which in the case of humans occur in rapid succession 接连不断地 without punctuation 标点 or conventions of composition. The thoughts of the characters in Ulysses are presented in this fashion, jumping from one idea to the next seemingly without any connection. +

Or take the German writer Franz Kafka, who challenged old conventions by combining elegant writing with elements of fantastical imagination 奇幻想象. His most known work -- and probably one you've had to read in school -- was The Metamorphosis 变形记, in which the protagonist 主人公 wakes up from his sleep only to realize that he's been mysteriously transformed into a giant cockroach 蟑螂. +

Okay, now yet another significant change in the 20th and 21st centuries came in the forms of consumerism 消费主义 and a baby boom 婴儿潮. In terms of consumerism, the disposable income 可支配收入 of the average European significantly increased during this time thanks to World War II factories that had perfected their workflow with the production of munitions 军火 began cranking out 大量生产 consumer products like mad. Thus the middle class folks were enjoying the fruits of a growing economy. They were able to spend money on things and make their lives more comfortable -- like you know, electricity and cars and indoor plumbing 室内管道系统 and plastics and clothing made from synthetic fibers 合成纤维. +

Simultaneously 同时, in the post-war years there was a massive baby boom, which is to say the population exploded 激增. Several European governments encouraged the baby boom by investing in pronatalist policies 鼓励生育政策, which is to say policies that encourage people to have babies. These policies included paid maternity leave 带薪产假 and tax credits 税收抵免 for each child born. Now this increase occurred more sharply in Western countries than it did in, say, the Soviet Union, and that had many different causes, most of which went back to the massive deaths racked up as a result of the war. +

Now it's also going to be important for you to know that during this period, several groups fought for an expansion of civil rights 公民权利. Since I have a whole video outlining the women's rights movement of the 20th century, here I'll just focus on gay and lesbian civil rights movements 男女同性恋者的公民权利运动. Now to be clear, prior to these movements homosexuality 同性恋 was outlawed 被取缔 in almost all European states. And while many groups fought to overturn these, I just want to introduce you to the most famous of them known as the Homosexual Front for Revolutionary Action 同性恋革命行动阵线, which occurred in France in 1971. They began their movement by interrupting a radio broadcast in which a Catholic priest was arguing against the acceptance of homosexuality. They broke in, pounded his head on the desk, and then shouted into the microphone that there was nothing wrong with them and that the policies against gays and lesbians needed to be overturned. Not surprisingly, the radio station quickly cut the microphones and called the police. But this and other movements across Europe like it fought for the equality of LGBTQ people in the 20th and 21st century. In some places like France they won many victories, but in other places -- especially in Eastern Europe -- they faced stiff opposition 强烈反对. +

And that, my friends, is the end of the curriculum. I cannot tell you how grateful I am that you have all come around and endured my goofy jokes. I'm proud of you for getting this far, and when you go to take that AP exam in May, just know that there is a bald, bearded, gap-toothed man cheering you on. I'll see you next year. Heimler out. +

== 中文释义

哦，天哪，这是整个AP欧洲史课程的最后一个视频了。不过我会在视频结尾和大家道别，还可能会流下一滴眼泪。现在，我们需要谈谈20世纪和21世纪的文化、艺术以及人口趋势。所以，如果你准备好最后一次获取知识，那就开始吧。 +

如果你还记得第8单元的内容，我提到过在第一次世界大战之前，每个人都热衷于 “科学！”，但在第一次世界大战之后，每个人都开始质疑 “科学？”。你看，几个世纪以来，科学一直被一种"进步"的叙事所主导 —— 因为我们的科学进步，世界变得越来越好。**#在20世纪初，由于科学，人类以为能即将进入一个完美的世界。但这种幻想在两次世界大战的战场上破灭了。科学进步被用来消灭大量的人类(科技是把双刃剑, 能被用来制造福利, 也能被暴君用来毁灭人类)。#**所以，这两次世界大战的结果是，人们对科学能够解决我们所有问题的信心下降了。 +

因此，这个时代的哲学开始反映出对世界的这种幻灭，并引发了对"启蒙理性主义"的强烈反对。第一个发展是**"存在主义"的兴起。这是一种哲学，它认为世界是荒谬的，并且尽管世界荒谬，但意义仍需被找到。**弗里德里希·尼采（Friedrich Nietzsche）可以说是这种思维方式的代表人物。他的观点是：上帝已死，是欧洲人杀死了上帝，因此，既然上帝已死，生命在本质上是没有意义的。 +

好的，第二个发展出现在20世纪50年代，这就是**"后现代主义"。它通过指出"所有的真理都是相对的"，来反对启蒙运动所坚信的确定性。换句话说，每一种不同的文化, 都有其独特的看待世界的方式, 和与之互动的价值观。因此，后现代主义哲学家会说，没有一种文化或一个思想家能垄断绝对真理，因为所有关于真理的主张, 都受到文化的制约。** +

所以，从这两种哲学发展中可以看出，旧的启蒙理性主义不再占据主导地位。但这并不意味着欧洲人就完全抛弃了他们的宗教。诚然，在20世纪和21世纪，欧洲变得更加世俗化，但尽管面临许多挑战，有组织的宗教, 在欧洲的社会和文化生活中仍然发挥着重要作用。 +

例如，**在20世纪，教会不得不应对"极权政府"，它们的反应各不相同。**在德国，迪特里希·朋霍费尔（Dietrich Bonhoeffer）创立了"认信教会"（the Confessing Church），该教会强烈批评纳粹政策，尤其是纳粹的反犹政策。但由于被怀疑参与了刺杀希特勒的行动，朋霍费尔在战争即将结束时被处决了。 +

但在意大利，情况有所不同。*墨索里尼（Mussolini）上台后，他明白自己需要罗马天主教会的支持。所以他承认了梵蒂冈城（Vatican City）的独立，并宣布天主教为意大利的官方宗教。作为回应，教皇鼓励信徒支持法西斯政府。* +

**在波兰，教会不得不应对苏联共产主义的压迫。**1980年，一个名为 “团结工联”（Solidarity）的组织成立了，它本质上是一个华沙以外的波兰工会。苏联竭尽全力镇压这一反对力量，但未能成功。1978年，一位来自波兰的天主教红衣主教, 当选为天主教教皇，取名为约翰·保罗二世（John Paul II）。*这位教皇同情"团结工联"的目标，在经济上支持他们削弱波兰苏联共产主义政权的努力。* +

这些就是教会应对"极权主义"的几个例子。但既然我们在谈论宗教，我需要告诉你，天主教会在20世纪60年代的第二次梵蒂冈大公会议（the Second Vatican Council）上, 经历了一场大规模的改革运动。你可能也听说过它被称为 “梵二会议”（Vatican II），但要知道它们指的是同一件事 —— 别搞混了。这次大公会议的目的, 本质上是让教会与时俱进，以应对现代世界。其中一个最重要的改变, 是允许牧师用本国语言, 而不是拉丁语来做弥撒。此外，教会还做出决议，要与基督教的其他教派，即新教徒和东正教徒，建立更友好的关系。最终，这些全面的改革, 导致了天主教在欧洲各地的复兴。 +

我已经提到过在20世纪，哲学和科学是如何引领人们质疑和削弱客观知识的。艺术也走上了同样的道路。还记得在第7单元我们谈到了20世纪初"立体主义"的兴起。在这个运动中，绘画的主题几乎变得荒谬。这是一种用二维形式描绘三维物体的风格。巴勃罗·毕加索（Pablo Picasso）可能是这些艺术家中最著名的。 +

然后出现了意大利和俄罗斯的艺术运动，即"未来主义"（futurism），在这个运动中，艺术家们强调 —— 你懂的 —— 未来。他们强调意大利和俄罗斯的未来，以便使它们摆脱近期复杂的历史。例如，这是俄罗斯未来主义画家娜塔莉亚·冈察洛娃（Natalia Goncharova）的一幅画，你可以看到画中手指指向后方，而骑自行车的人则大胆地向未来骑行。 +

接着出现了**"达达主义"（Dadaism），这是对两次世界大战摧毁欧洲大陆后, 人们感受到的生活无意义的一种回应。如果生活是没有目的的，那么艺术也应该是没有目的的。**一个典型的例子是马塞尔·杜尚（Marcel Duchamp）著名的达达主义作品《泉》（Fountain）。如果你在想 “等等，那只是一个小便池 —— 那不是艺术”，没错！这是对西方"审美价值无意义"的一种讽刺性评论。 +

然后出现了**"超现实主义"**（surrealism）艺术运动。其理念是，由于西格蒙德·弗洛伊德（Sigmund Freud）**揭示了人类混乱且未经雕琢的内心世界，艺术也应该反映这些现实。**例如，超现实主义画家中最著名的是萨尔瓦多·达利（Salvador Dalí），你可以看看他的画作《记忆的永恒》（The Persistence of Memory）。我的意思是，**这幅画看起来就像是梦境中的景象。**显然，他用融化的时钟, 来评论令人不安的时间相对性。 +

但在20世纪，不仅仅是视觉艺术发生了变化。*建筑也发生了变化。例如，包豪斯建筑学派（the Bauhaus School of Architecture）在两次世界大战之间的德国兴起。他们的目标是根据建筑的功能来设计建筑，而不是关注那些无用的形式传统。所以你可以看到，他们的建筑没有装饰，看起来就像是钢铁和玻璃构成的盒子。* +

文学也卷入了这些变化之中。正如你可能预料到的，**作家们开始挑战那些传承下来的形式。**爱尔兰小说家詹姆斯·乔伊斯（James Joyce）使一种叫做**"意识流"**的新创作形式流行起来。其理念是在书页上**重现一个人物的真实想法，而人类的真实想法是快速连续出现的，**没有标点符号或传统的写作规范。《尤利西斯》（Ulysses）中人物的想法就是以这种方式呈现的，*从一个想法跳到另一个想法，看似毫无关联。* +

再比如德国作家弗朗茨·卡夫卡（Franz Kafka），他将优雅的写作与奇幻的想象元素相结合，挑战了旧的传统。他最著名的作品 —— 可能也是你在学校里不得不读的作品 —— 是《变形记》（The Metamorphosis），在这部作品中，主人公从睡梦中醒来，却发现自己神秘地变成了一只巨大的蟑螂。 +

好的，在20世纪和21世纪，另一个重大变化, 体现在消费主义和婴儿潮方面。就消费主义而言，由于第二次世界大战期间, 那些完善了生产流程的工厂开始疯狂生产消费品，普通欧洲人的"可支配收入"在这一时期大幅增加。因此，中产阶级享受着经济增长带来的成果。他们有能力花钱购买各种东西，让自己的生活更加舒适 —— 比如电力、汽车、室内管道设施, 以及合成纤维制成的服装。 +

与此同时，在战后时期出现了大规模的婴儿潮，也就是说人口激增。一些欧洲国家的政府, 通过推行鼓励生育的政策, 来推动婴儿潮的出现，这些政策包括"带薪产假", 和对每个出生孩子的税收抵免。这种人口增长, 在西方国家比在苏联等国家更为明显，这有很多原因，其中大部分原因可以追溯到战争导致的大量人员死亡。 +

还有一点很重要，你需要知道，在这一时期，一些团体为扩大公民权利而斗争。由于我已经有一个完整的视频概述了20世纪的女权运动，在这里我将重点介绍"同性恋"权利运动。需要明确的是，在这些运动之前，同性恋在几乎所有欧洲国家都是非法的。虽然有许多团体为推翻这些禁令而斗争，但我只想向你介绍其中最著名的组织，即 “革命行动同性恋阵线”（the Homosexual Front for Revolutionary Action），它于1971年在法国成立。他们的运动始于打断一个广播节目，在那个节目中，一位天主教牧师在反对接受同性恋。他们闯入节目，把牧师的头按在桌子上，然后对着麦克风大喊他们没有错，针对同性恋的政策需要被推翻。不出所料，广播电台迅速切断了麦克风并报警。但在20世纪和21世纪，这样的运动, 以及欧洲其他类似的运动, 都在为男女同性恋、双性恋和跨性别者（LGBTQ）的平等而斗争。在像法国这样的一些地方，他们取得了许多胜利，但在其他地方 —— 尤其是在东欧 —— 他们面临着强烈的反对。 +

在20世纪，并不是每个人都对"消费主义"的扩张感到高兴，主要是那些在60年代成年的人。反主流文化运动, 强烈反对消费主义所带来的文化一致性。此外，他们不仅抗议消费主义导致的"文化一致性"，还抗议消费主义造成的贫富差距日益扩大。反主流文化运动的高潮是1968年的一系列反抗活动。在整个欧洲 —— 实际上在全世界 —— 学生们领导了反对不平等、反对越南战争、反对资本主义的弊端, 以及"反对压迫性政府"的抗议活动。 +

其中一个最引人注目的例子, 发生在1968年5月的法国。在那次事件中，一群受"新左派"意识形态影响的学生, 抗议他们大学的保守政策。这导致了与警察的暴力冲突，冲突中财产被破坏，许多学生受伤。几天后，1000万工人举行大罢工，加入了抗议行列，法国政府似乎即将被这些抗议者推翻。最终，政府和大学都进行了一些改革，这场运动逐渐平息。 +

朋友们，这就是本课程的结尾了。我无法表达我对你们一直以来陪伴并忍受我那些傻傻的笑话的感激之情。我为你们能学到这里而感到骄傲，当你们参加五月份的AP考试时，请记住，有一个光头、留着胡子、牙齿有缝隙的人在为你们加油。明年再见。海姆勒（Heimler）下线了。 +

Oh my goodness, it is the last video of the entire AP Euro curriculum. But I'll tell you goodbye and shed a single tear at the end of the video. For now, we need to talk about the 20th and the 21st century culture, arts, and demographic trends. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked one last time, let's get to it.

Now if you remember all the way back to Unit 8, I mentioned that before World War One everyone was like "science!", but after World War One everyone was like "science?" You see, for centuries science was dominated by a narrative of progress -- the world is getting better and better because of our scientific progress. And at the turn of the 20th century, humanity was about to enter a perfect world thanks to science. That illusion had been destroyed on the battlefields of both World Wars. Scientific progress could be used to destroy huge swaths of humanity. So the result of both of those world wars was a decreased confidence that science could solve all our problems.

And so the philosophy of the age began to reflect this disillusionment with the world and engendered a strong reaction against Enlightenment rationalism. The first development came in the rise of existentialism. This is a philosophy that assumed the world was absurd and that meaning had to be found in spite of that absurdity. Friedrich Nietzsche was kind of the poster boy for this manner of thinking. His reckoning: God was dead and Europeans had killed him, and thus now that God was dead, life was inherently meaningless.

Okay, now the second development came along in the 1950s and it was called postmodernism. It reacted against Enlightenment certainty by pointing out that all truth was relative. In other words, every different culture has unique ways of seeing the world and values by which it interacts with the world. Therefore, postmodern philosophers would say that no one culture or one thinker has the corner on absolute truth because all truth claims are culturally conditioned.

So in both these philosophical developments, you can see that the old Enlightenment rationalism was no longer reigning supreme. But that shouldn't tempt you to believe that Europeans were throwing away their religion left, right, and center. It is true that Europe grew more secular over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries, but it is also true that organized religion continued to play a significant role in European social and cultural life in spite of the many challenges it faced.

For example, in the 20th century the church had to contend with totalitarian governments, and their responses were mixed. In Germany, Dietrich Bonhoeffer founded the Confessing Church which was exceedingly vocal in its criticism of Nazi policies, especially their anti-Jewish policy. But for his suspected participation in an assassination attempt against Hitler, Bonhoeffer was executed in the waning days of the war.

But it was a different story over in Italy. When Mussolini rose to power, he understood that he needed the support of the Catholic Church in Rome. So he recognized the independence of Vatican City and proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Italy. In response, the pope encouraged the faithful to support the fascist government.

Over in Poland, the church had to contend with Soviet communist repression. In 1980, a group known as Solidarity was founded, which was essentially a Polish trade union that existed outside Warsaw. The Soviets tried their hardest to crush this opposition but could not. And in 1978, a Catholic cardinal from Poland was elected pope of the Catholic Church, taking the name John Paul II. Being sympathetic with the goals of Solidarity, the pope financially supported their efforts to undermine the Soviet communist regime in Poland.

So those are a couple examples of how the church responded to totalitarianism. But since we're talking about religion, I need to tell you that the Catholic Church underwent a massive reform movement in the 1960s at the Second Vatican Council. You'll also hear this called Vatican II, but you know it's the same thing -- don't get confused. The purpose of this council was essentially to update the church to respond to the modern world. One of the most significant changes was the allowance of priests to say the mass in vernacular languages rather than in Latin. Additionally, the church made resolutions to live on friendlier terms with other sects of Christianity, namely Protestants and Eastern Orthodox Christians. Ultimately these sweeping reforms led to a revival of Catholicism in various parts of Europe.

Now I already mentioned how philosophy and science were leading the way in questioning and undermining objective knowledge during the 20th century. The arts followed that same path as well. Remember in Unit 7 we talked about the rise of cubism around the turn of the 20th century. In this movement, the subject of the paintings became almost nonsensical. It was a style that depicted three-dimensional objects in two dimensions. Pablo Picasso was probably the most famous of these artists.

And then came the Italian and Russian artistic movement known as futurism, in which artists emphasized -- you know -- the future. They emphasized the future of Italy and Russia in order to free them from their recently checkered past. For example, here's a painting from the Russian futurist Natalia Goncharova, and you can see the finger pointing backwards while the cyclist defiantly pedals into the future.

Then came Dadaism, which was a response to the felt purposelessness of life after two world wars had devastated the European continent. If life was devoid of purpose, so too should art be devoid of purpose. Case in point: Marcel Duchamp's famous Dada piece called Fountain. If you're thinking "Wait, that's just a urinal -- that's not art," exactly! It is a satirical commentary on the meaninglessness of Western aesthetic values.

Then came the artistic movement known as surrealism. The idea here is that as Sigmund Freud had exposed the chaotic and unrefined interior worlds of human beings, art ought to reflect those same realities. For example, the most famous of the surrealists was Salvador Dalí, and here you can see his painting called The Persistence of Memory. I mean this looks like something out of a dreamscape. And apparently he meant the melting clocks would be a kind of commentary on the disturbing relativity of time.

But it wasn't only the visual arts that changed over the course of the 20th century. So too did architecture. For example, the Bauhaus School of Architecture emerged in Germany during the interwar years. Their goal was to design structures based on their function and to focus not on useless conventions of form. And so you can see here that their buildings lacked ornamentation but instead looked like boxes of steel and glass.

And literature also got caught up in the changes as well. As you might expect by this point, writers began challenging the forms that had been handed down. The Irish novelist James Joyce made popular a new form of composition called stream of consciousness. The idea here was to reproduce on the page a character's actual thoughts, which in the case of humans occur in rapid succession without punctuation or conventions of composition. The thoughts of the characters in Ulysses are presented in this fashion, jumping from one idea to the next seemingly without any connection.

Or take the German writer Franz Kafka, who challenged old conventions by combining elegant writing with elements of fantastical imagination. His most known work -- and probably one you've had to read in school -- was The Metamorphosis, in which the protagonist wakes up from his sleep only to realize that he's been mysteriously transformed into a giant cockroach.

Okay, now yet another significant change in the 20th and 21st centuries came in the forms of consumerism and a baby boom. In terms of consumerism, the disposable income of the average European significantly increased during this time thanks to World War II factories that had perfected their workflow with the production of munitions began cranking out consumer products like mad. Thus the middle class folks were enjoying the fruits of a growing economy. They were able to spend money on things and make their lives more comfortable -- like you know, electricity and cars and indoor plumbing and plastics and clothing made from synthetic fibers.

Simultaneously, in the post-war years there was a massive baby boom, which is to say the population exploded. Several European governments encouraged the baby boom by investing in pronatalist policies, which is to say policies that encourage people to have babies. These policies included paid maternity leave and tax credits for each child born. Now this increase occurred more sharply in Western countries than it did in, say, the Soviet Union, and that had many different causes, most of which went back to the massive deaths racked up as a result of the war.

Now it's also going to be important for you to know that during this period, several groups fought for an expansion of civil rights. Since I have a whole video outlining the women's rights movement of the 20th century, here I'll just focus on gay and lesbian civil rights movements. Now to be clear, prior to these movements homosexuality was outlawed in almost all European states. And while many groups fought to overturn these, I just want to introduce you to the most famous of them known as the Homosexual Front for Revolutionary Action, which occurred in France in 1971. They began their movement by interrupting a radio broadcast in which a Catholic priest was arguing against the acceptance of homosexuality. They broke in, pounded his head on the desk, and then shouted into the microphone that there was nothing wrong with them and that the policies against gays and lesbians needed to be overturned. Not surprisingly, the radio station quickly cut the microphones and called the police. But this and other movements across Europe like it fought for the equality of LGBTQ people in the 20th and 21st century. In some places like France they won many victories, but in other places -- especially in Eastern Europe -- they faced stiff opposition.

Now not everybody was happy about the expansion of consumerism in the 20th century, mainly composed of those who came of age during the 60s. The counterculture movement railed against the cultural conformity that consumerism created. Additionally, they protested not only the conformity caused by consumerism but the growing inequality between the rich and poor that it engendered. And the high water mark of the counterculture movement was the revolts of 1968. All across Europe -- and actually all across the world -- students led protests against inequality, the war in Vietnam, the abuses of capitalism, and oppressive government.

One of the most notable examples occurred in France in May of 1968. In that case, a group of students influenced by New Left ideologies protested conservative policies in their university. It led to violent clashes with the police in which property was destroyed and many students were injured. A couple days later, a general strike of 10 million workers joined the protest, and the French government looked as if it could fall to those protesters. Ultimately, the government made some reforms as did the university, and the movement fizzled out.

And that, my friends, is the end of the curriculum. I cannot tell you how grateful I am that you have all come around and endured my goofy jokes. I'm proud of you for getting this far, and when you go to take that AP exam in May, just know that there is a bald, bearded, gap-toothed man cheering you on. I'll see you next year. Heimler out.
