== 释义

All right, remember our boy Louis XIV of France with a sweet butt cut （口语化表达，奇特的发型）and how he was all like, "I am the state 我即国家"? So he was the template 模板 for absolutist rulers 专制统治者 in the 18th century. But later in the century, a new kind of absolutist ruler would emerge 出现, namely the enlightened absolutist 开明专制君主. And so in this video, I reckon （口语化表达，认为；估计）we ought to talk about that. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked absolutely （幽默表达，获取知识）, then let's get to it. +

So let's start, as is proper （习语，恰当地）, with a definition. Enlightened absolutism 开明专制主义 describes 18th-century monarchs 君主 who wanted to retain 保留 absolute power 绝对权力 but also aimed to shape and temper 调整 the exercise of that power by Enlightenment ideals 启蒙思想理念. By the way, if you want notes to follow along with （习语，跟随；对照）this video, then get your clicky finger out and head down to （习语，前往）the link in the description. +

Many of the most significant philosophes 哲学家 were surprisingly down with （口语化表达，赞同；支持）this. I mean, because royal absolutism 君主专制 was basically a given 既定事实 among several states of the 18th century, the philosophes understood that it really wasn't going away. Therefore, according to their beliefs, the best way Enlightenment ideals could shape politics 影响政治 is through a powerful monarch who embodied 体现 those ideas. +

And the three rulers who most exemplify 例证 this new conception of power 权力观念 were Frederick II of Prussia 普鲁士的腓特烈二世, Catherine II of Russia 俄国的叶卡捷琳娜二世, and Joseph II of Austria 奥地利的约瑟夫二世. +

And let me introduce you to each. First, let me introduce you to Frederick II of Prussia, also known as Frederick the Great 腓特烈大帝. Now, he inherited 继承 a powerful army from his father's reign 统治时期, and when you have a powerful army as an absolutist ruler, it's hard not to start thinking to yourself, "Sure, it would be nice to kill a bunch of people and take some land. Yeah, let's do that." +

So one of Frederick's first acts was to expand his territory 领土 in the style of the absolutists of old 旧式专制君主. And so he immediately seized 夺取 the Habsburg territory 哈布斯堡领土 of Silesia 西里西亚 in the War of Austrian Succession 奥地利王位继承战争, which doubled Prussia's population and significantly increased its power. +

Now, that doesn't sound very enlightened to me. Just wait for it. But after such a slight 冒犯, Maria Theresa 玛丽亚·特蕾西亚, the Habsburg ruler of Austria from whom Frederick took Silesia, was all like, "No, amiga （西班牙语，朋友）." Therefore, she allied with （习语，与……结盟）France and Russia not only to gain Silesia back but to conquer the whole dang Prussian territory entirely. +

And this became one conflict in the larger Seven Years' War 七年战争, which we'll talk more about in Unit 5. Anyway, Frederick the Great was besieged on all sides （习语，被四面围困）and was only saved when a change in power occurred in Russia, namely Peter III 彼得三世, who called off the attack against Prussia （习语，取消对……的进攻）. +

Now, everything I've said so far just indicates that Frederick was an absolutist, not an enlightened absolutist. So let me tell you how that change occurred. The great struggle that Frederick endured 忍受 during the Seven Years' War led him to consider a new kind of rule, tempered by more humane policies 人道政策 informed by Enlightenment thought 启蒙思想. +

In fact, if you compare Louis XIV's assessment of his own power -- namely, "I am the state" -- with Frederick's new assessment of his power -- namely, "I am the first servant of the state 我是国家的第一公仆" -- you can clearly see the transition 转变. +

Additionally, Frederick took pains to （习语，努力；煞费苦心）justify his rule not by the divine right of kings 君权神授 but rather by implementing policies that improved the lives of his subjects 臣民. So let's have a look at Frederick's more enlightened policies. +

First was the enactment 制定 of greater religious toleration 宗教宽容. As a non-believer himself, Frederick tolerated all faiths 信仰 in his kingdom. However, he did seem to favor 偏爱 Protestants 新教徒 over Jews 犹太人 and Catholics 天主教徒 when it came time to appoint people to state bureaucratic positions 政府官僚职位. Even so, he upheld 支持 the importance, for example, of Catholic Jesuits 天主教耶稣会士 as educators in Prussia and granted an unheard-of degree of freedom for Jews 给予犹太人前所未有的自由. +

Second, Frederick instigated 发起 legal reform 法律改革. He led the effort to simplify Prussia's complex set of laws 简化普鲁士复杂的法律体系 and abolish torture 废除酷刑 as a legitimate means of punishment 合法的惩罚手段. +

Third, Frederick engaged in （习语，参与）bureaucratic reform 官僚改革. And for that, he adopted the German principles of cameralism 官房主义原则. These principles argued that yes, monarchy 君主制 is the most effective form of government, and thus all elements of the state and society ought to be subservient to （习语，屈从于；服从于）the monarch. However, the state had the responsibility not to be a power-hungry turd （俚语，贪婪权力的废物）and instead use its power for the betterment of society 改善社会. +

All right, that was fun. But now let's see how enlightened absolutism is shaping up （习语，发展；形成）over in Russia. For that, let me introduce you to Catherine II, also known as Catherine the Great 叶卡捷琳娜大帝. +

So Catherine married Peter III, who was the same guy that I mentioned before who saved Frederick the Great's hind parts （口语化表达，屁股；此处指摆脱困境）in the Seven Years' War. But Catherine wasn't interested in being the wife of a monarch. She wanted to be the monarch. +

In fact, when she wrote her memoirs 回忆录, she said it plain: "I did not care about Peter, but I did care about the crown 王冠." Oh, that's cold. So she went ahead and hatched a plot （习语，密谋；策划）to get her husband murdered and thus became Russia's ruler. +

And even though she murdered her way into power 通过谋杀夺取权力, her education was replete with （习语，充满）Enlightenment ideals 启蒙思想理念, which informed her three major goals 影响她的三大目标. First, she aimed to continue Peter the Great's efforts to westernize Russia 使俄国西化. To that end （习语，为此）, she patronized philosophes 赞助哲学家, of whom Voltaire 伏尔泰 was her favorite. +

She also paid for Diderot's Encyclopedia 狄德罗的《百科全书》to be published in Russia after it came under the censorship of 受到……审查 the French government. And additionally, she imported Western architects and artists into Russia 引进西方建筑师和艺术家. +

Second, she enacted legal reform. To that end, she allowed limited religious toleration 有限的宗教宽容 and, like Frederick II, outlawed torture 禁止酷刑 in Russia. +

Her third goal centered around （习语，围绕）territorial expansion 领土扩张. And the most significant expansion she participated in was the partition of Poland 瓜分波兰, which we talked about in the last unit. If you forgot, this was an agreement to divide the entirety of Polish territory between Prussia, Austria, and Russia. +

So, you know, she was pretty enlightened. But there was a significant limit to her enlightened absolutism, and that came in the Pugachev Rebellion 普加乔夫起义. +

Now, one of the most enlightened moves an enlightened monarch could make during this period was to emancipate the serfs 解放农奴, which were those lower-class citizens 下层民众 who had worked the land of the nobles 贵族土地 and were, in practice 实际上, a little different from slaves 与奴隶有点不同. +

But in 1773, a soldier named Emilian Pugachev 叶梅利安·普加乔夫 rose up （习语，起义；反抗）and gathered a ragtag army 乌合之众 of serfs. He summarily 立即 proclaimed himself the true czar of Russia 宣称自己为俄国真正的沙皇 and abolished serfdom 废除农奴制. But unfortunately for Pugachev, his untrained militia 未经训练的民兵 was crushed by Catherine's army, which was led by nobles 被贵族率领的叶卡捷琳娜军队击败. +

And so after executing Pugachev 处决普加乔夫, any intentions Catherine had about reforming the institution of serfdom 改革农奴制的意图 were gone, and she even increased their oppression 压迫. +

Okay, now Joseph II of Austria was another enlightened absolutist who sought reforms 寻求改革 in his state. To this end 为此, he enacted several royal decrees 颁布几项皇家法令, which included the following: +

First, he signed the Edicts of Toleration 宽容法令, which granted religious freedom 宗教自由 for Jews and other religious minorities 宗教少数派. Second, he increased the freedom of the press 新闻自由. And third, he put strictures on （习语，对……加以限制）the power of the Catholic Church 天主教会的权力. +

All that was pretty enlightened. But unfortunately for Joseph, he enacted these reforms real fast without consulting the nobility or the clergy 神职人员. And because they got a little saucy about it （口语化表达，对此不满）, Joseph's reforms led to significant domestic turmoil 国内动荡 during his reign 统治时期. +

Now, as you have hopefully witnessed by now, one of the chief markers 主要标志 of enlightened absolutism was an effort towards religious toleration 宗教宽容. But one religious group can serve as a test case for （习语，作为……的案例）the limits of that toleration, namely the Jews 犹太人. +

In many European states of the 18th century, Jews were significantly marginalized by law 被法律严重边缘化. But with a rising environment of religious toleration engendered by 由……引发的 the Enlightenment, a Jewish Enlightenment movement called Haskalah 哈斯卡拉运动 also emerged. +

Their argument was that the widespread religious intolerance of the Jews was unfitting for 不适合 the enlightened atmosphere in Europe 欧洲的开明氛围. Now, as I mentioned earlier, Joseph II of Austria most fully embraced the call for Jewish freedom 最充分地响应给予犹太人自由的呼吁. Among his reforms were laws allowing Jews to serve in the military 参军 or to enter higher education 接受高等教育 and abolishing the distinguishing symbols 取消区别性标志 that Jews were made to wear 被迫佩戴的标志. +

Frederick the Great and Catherine the Great, despite their impulses towards religious toleration 尽管他们有宗教宽容的倾向, rejected any easing of anti-Jewish policies 拒绝放宽反犹政策 in their states. In fact, after Catherine acquired the large Jewish population of Poland after the partition 瓜分波兰后获得大量犹太人口, she created a separate district 隔离区 in which all Jews were required to live. +

== 中文释义

好的，还记得法国的路易十四（Louis XIV）吗，他留着时髦的发型，还宣称“我即国家”？他是18世纪专制统治者的典型代表。但在那个世纪后期，一种新型的专制统治者出现了，也就是开明专制君主。所以在这个视频中，我认为我们应该来谈谈这个。所以，如果你准备好充分充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

所以，恰当地说，我们从定义开始。开明专制主义描述的是18世纪的君主，他们想要保留绝对权力，但也旨在用启蒙思想来塑造和约束权力的行使。顺便说一下，如果你想要这个视频的笔记，那就伸出你的手指点击描述中的链接。  +

许多重要的哲学家出人意料地支持这种观点。我的意思是，因为在18世纪的几个国家中，君主专制基本上是既定事实，哲学家们明白它不会消失。因此，根据他们的信念，启蒙思想塑造政治的最佳方式是通过一位体现这些思想的强大君主。  +

最能体现这种新权力观念的三位统治者是普鲁士的腓特烈二世（Frederick II of Prussia）、俄罗斯的叶卡捷琳娜二世（Catherine II of Russia）和奥地利的约瑟夫二世（Joseph II of Austria）。  +

让我分别介绍一下他们。首先，让我介绍一下普鲁士的腓特烈二世，也被称为腓特烈大帝（Frederick the Great）。他从父亲的统治中继承了一支强大的军队，作为一个专制统治者，当你拥有一支强大的军队时，很难不这样想：“当然，杀死一群人并夺取一些土地会很不错。没错，就这么干。”  +

所以腓特烈的首要行动之一就是以旧专制君主的方式扩张领土。于是，在奥地利王位继承战争中，他立即夺取了哈布斯堡王朝的西里西亚（Silesia）领土，这使普鲁士的人口翻倍，实力也大幅增强。  +

现在，这听起来可不怎么开明。先别急。但是在这样的冒犯之后，被腓特烈夺走西里西亚的奥地利哈布斯堡统治者玛丽亚·特蕾莎（Maria Theresa）表示：“不，朋友。” 因此，她与法国和俄罗斯结盟，不仅要夺回西里西亚，还要完全征服整个普鲁士领土。  +

这成为了更大规模的七年战争中的一场冲突，我们将在第五单元详细讨论七年战争。总之，腓特烈大帝被各方围攻，直到俄罗斯的权力发生变化，也就是彼得三世（Peter III）叫停了对普鲁士的攻击，他才得以获救。  +

到目前为止我说的一切都表明腓特烈只是一个专制君主，而不是开明专制君主。所以让我告诉你这种转变是如何发生的。腓特烈在七年战争中所经历的巨大斗争使他考虑一种新的统治方式，用启蒙思想所带来的更人道的政策来约束统治。  +

事实上，如果你将路易十四对自己权力的评估——也就是“我即国家”——与腓特烈对自己权力的新评估——也就是“我是国家的第一公仆”——相比较，你可以清楚地看到这种转变。  +

此外，腓特烈努力不以君权神授来为自己的统治辩护，而是通过实施改善臣民生活的政策来证明。所以让我们看看腓特烈更开明的政策。  +

首先是实行更大程度的宗教宽容。作为一个不信教的人，腓特烈在他的王国里容忍所有信仰。然而，在任命国家官僚职位时，他似乎确实更倾向于新教徒，而不是犹太人和天主教徒。即便如此，他也认可天主教耶稣会士在普鲁士作为教育者的重要性，并给予犹太人前所未有的自由。  +

其次，腓特烈发起了法律改革。他努力简化普鲁士复杂的法律体系，并废除了将酷刑作为一种合法惩罚手段。  +

第三，腓特烈进行了官僚改革。为此，他采用了德国的官房主义原则。这些原则认为，君主制确实是最有效的政府形式，因此国家和社会的所有要素都应该服从君主。然而，国家有责任不成为一个贪婪的权力体，而是利用其权力改善社会。  +

好的，这很有趣。但现在让我们看看开明专制主义在俄罗斯是如何发展的。为此，让我介绍一下叶卡捷琳娜二世（Catherine II），也被称为叶卡捷琳娜大帝（Catherine the Great）。  +

叶卡捷琳娜嫁给了彼得三世，就是我之前提到的在七年战争中拯救了腓特烈大帝的那个人。但叶卡捷琳娜对成为君主的妻子不感兴趣。她想成为君主。  +

事实上，当她写回忆录时，她直白地说：“我不在乎彼得，但我在乎王位。” 哦，真冷酷。所以她着手策划谋杀她的丈夫，从而成为了俄罗斯的统治者。  +

尽管她通过谋杀夺取了权力，但她所受的教育充满了启蒙思想，这形成了她的三大目标。首先，她旨在继续彼得大帝（Peter the Great）使俄罗斯西化的努力。为此，她赞助哲学家，伏尔泰（Voltaire）是她最喜欢的哲学家。  +

在狄德罗（Denis Diderot）的《百科全书》受到法国政府审查后，她出资让其在俄罗斯出版。此外，她还将西方的建筑师和艺术家引入俄罗斯。  +

其次，她实施了法律改革。为此，她允许有限的宗教宽容，并且和腓特烈二世一样，在俄罗斯废除了酷刑。  +

她的第三个目标围绕领土扩张。她参与的最重大的领土扩张是瓜分波兰，我们在上一单元讨论过这件事。如果你忘了，这是一项将波兰全部领土在普鲁士、奥地利和俄罗斯之间进行划分的协议。  +

所以，你懂的，她相当开明。但她的开明专制也有很大的局限性，这体现在普加乔夫起义（Pugachev Rebellion）中。  +

在这个时期，开明君主最开明的举措之一就是解放农奴，农奴是为贵族耕种土地的下层民众，实际上他们和奴隶有点不同。  +

但在1773年，一个名叫叶梅利扬·普加乔夫（Emilian Pugachev）的士兵起义，召集了一群乌合之众的农奴。他立即宣称自己是俄罗斯的真正沙皇，并废除农奴制。但对普加乔夫来说不幸的是，他未经训练的民兵被叶卡捷琳娜的由贵族领导的军队镇压了。  +

所以在处决普加乔夫之后，叶卡捷琳娜改革农奴制度的意图荡然无存，她甚至加剧了对农奴的压迫。  +

好的，现在奥地利的约瑟夫二世是另一位寻求在他的国家进行改革的开明专制君主。为此，他颁布了几项皇家法令，包括以下内容：  +

首先，他签署了《宽容法令》，给予犹太人和其他宗教少数群体宗教自由。其次，他增加了新闻出版的自由。第三，他对天主教会的权力加以限制。  +

这些都相当开明。但对约瑟夫来说不幸的是，他在没有咨询贵族或神职人员的情况下迅速实施这些改革。因为他们对此有点不满，约瑟夫的改革在他的统治期间引发了严重的国内动荡。  +

现在，希望你已经看到，开明专制主义的主要标志之一是努力实现宗教宽容。但有一个宗教群体可以作为检验这种宽容限度的案例，那就是犹太人。  +

在18世纪的许多欧洲国家，犹太人在法律上被严重边缘化。但随着启蒙运动带来的宗教宽容环境的兴起，一场名为哈斯卡拉（Haskalah）的犹太启蒙运动也出现了。  +

他们认为，对犹太人广泛的宗教不宽容与欧洲的开明氛围不符。正如我之前提到的，奥地利的约瑟夫二世最充分地响应了给予犹太人自由的呼吁。他的改革措施包括允许犹太人在军队服役或接受高等教育的法律，并废除了要求犹太人佩戴的用以区分的标志。  +

腓特烈大帝和叶卡捷琳娜大帝尽管有实行宗教宽容的意向，但在他们的国家拒绝放宽任何反犹政策。事实上，叶卡捷琳娜在瓜分波兰后获得了大量的犹太人口，她建立了一个单独的区域，要求所有犹太人居住在那里。  +

But later in the century, a new kind of absolutist ruler would emerge, namely the enlightened absolutist. And so in this video, I reckon we ought to talk about that. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked absolutely, then let's get to it.

So let's start, as is proper, with a definition. Enlightened absolutism describes 18th-century monarchs who wanted to retain absolute power but also aimed to shape and temper the exercise of that power by Enlightenment ideals. By the way, if you want notes to follow along with this video, then get your clicky finger out and head down to the link in the description.

Therefore, according to their beliefs, the best way Enlightenment ideals could shape politics is through a powerful monarch who embodied those ideas.

And the three rulers who most exemplify this new conception of power were Frederick II of Prussia, Catherine II of Russia, and Joseph II of Austria.

And let me introduce you to each. First, let me introduce you to Frederick II of Prussia, also known as Frederick the Great. Now, he inherited a powerful army from his father's reign, and when you have a powerful army as an absolutist ruler, it's hard not to start thinking to yourself, "Sure, it would be nice to kill a bunch of people and take some land. Yeah, let's do that."

So one of Frederick's first acts was to expand his territory in the style of the absolutists of old. And so he immediately seized the Habsburg territory of Silesia in the War of Austrian Succession, which doubled Prussia's population and significantly increased its power.

Now, that doesn't sound very enlightened to me. Just wait for it. But after such a slight, Maria Theresa, the Habsburg ruler of Austria from whom Frederick took Silesia, was all like, "No, amiga." Therefore, she allied with France and Russia not only to gain Silesia back but to conquer the whole dang Prussian territory entirely.

The great struggle that Frederick endured during the Seven Years' War led him to consider a new kind of rule, tempered by more humane policies informed by Enlightenment thought.

In fact, if you compare Louis XIV's assessment of his own power -- namely, "I am the state" -- with Frederick's new assessment of his power -- namely, "I am the first servant of the state" -- you can clearly see the transition.

Additionally, Frederick took pains to justify his rule not by the divine right of kings but rather by implementing policies that improved the lives of his subjects. So let's have a look at Frederick's more enlightened policies.

First was the enactment of greater religious toleration. As a non-believer himself, Frederick tolerated all faiths in his kingdom. However, he did seem to favor Protestants over Jews and Catholics when it came time to appoint people to state bureaucratic positions. Even so, he upheld the importance, for example, of Catholic Jesuits as educators in Prussia and granted an unheard-of degree of freedom for Jews.

Second, Frederick instigated legal reform. He led the effort to simplify Prussia's complex set of laws and abolish torture as a legitimate means of punishment.

Third, Frederick engaged in bureaucratic reform. And for that, he adopted the German principles of cameralism. These principles argued that yes, monarchy is the most effective form of government, and thus all elements of the state and society ought to be subservient to the monarch. However, the state had the responsibility not to be a power-hungry turd and instead use its power for the betterment of society.

All right, that was fun. But now let's see how enlightened absolutism is shaping up over in Russia. For that, let me introduce you to Catherine II, also known as Catherine the Great.

So Catherine married Peter III, who was the same guy that I mentioned before who saved Frederick the Great's hind parts in the Seven Years' War. But Catherine wasn't interested in being the wife of a monarch. She wanted to be the monarch.
