There's only so long a culture can emphasize Enlightenment rationalism 启蒙理性主义 before the human heart is going to pop up 突然出现 and say, "Bruh, you've got to feel stuff too." So here at the end of unit five, we're going to see exactly how that happened with the rise of Romanticism 浪漫主义. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. By the way, I've got follow-along notes 配套笔记 for this video, and you can find those at the link in the description 说明；描述. +

So as we talked about in unit 4, the Enlightenment 启蒙运动 came to dominate 主导 European thought in the 18th century -- at the very least among the elite 精英, although it did filter down to 逐渐传播到 the masses 大众 eventually. And the key emphasis 重点；关键 of the Enlightenment was to apply rational 理性的, rigorous 严密的 scientific thought to every human institution 机构. So there was a kind of cold, calculating 精于算计的 aura 氛围 to this kind of thought. Enlightenment thinkers believed in general that if you couldn't math out 用数学方法算出 your conclusions 结论 or prove 证明 them in a logical syllogism 逻辑三段论, then you couldn't really know it. +

But Romanticism rose up 兴起 in the end of the 18th century to challenge 挑战 such rational ways of interpreting 解释 the world. By definition 从定义上讲, Romanticism acted as a balance to reason 理性 by emphasizing 强调 other means of knowing, like intuition 直觉 and imagination 想象力. Additionally 此外, Romantics held to 坚持 individualism 个人主义, which emphasized the glory 荣耀 of the unique 独特的 traits 特质 of each human being. +

Now, surprisingly, we can actually trace the roots of 追溯…的根源 this movement back to one of the greatest Enlightenment thinkers, namely 即；也就是 Jean-Jacques Rousseau 让 - 雅克·卢梭, who admittedly 诚然 had somewhat of a strained 紧张的 relationship with reason as the sole 唯一的 means to interpret the world. He was so different from his Enlightenment colleagues 同僚 by emphasizing feelings 情感 and passion 激情 sometimes above reason itself. He believed and taught that God was benevolent 仁慈的 and accessible 可接近的 through a person's affections 情感, therefore alienating 使疏远 those rascally 无赖的 deists 自然神论者. He also emphasized the moral improvement 道德提升 of the self and society. And with all this emphasis on subjectivity 主观性, Rousseau is typically 通常 seen as the forerunner 先驱 of the Romantic movement. +

So in terms of 在…方面 the arts, Romanticism rejected 拒绝；摒弃 the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and neoclassicism's 新古典主义的 emphasis on sterility 刻板 and control 控制. Romantics emphasized emotional exuberance 情感的奔放, imaginative exploration 富有想象力的探索, and spontaneity 自发性. You can see this emphasis pretty clearly in romantic literature 浪漫主义文学. +

Some romantic writers felt deeply for their own people and their own history and thus produced works that engendered 产生；引发 nationalism 民族主义. For example, the Grimm Brothers 格林兄弟 collected German fairy tales 童话故事 and morality stories 道德故事 and published 出版 them under the title Children's and Household Tales 《儿童与家庭童话集》. I'll wager 打赌 you've heard some of these stories: Cinderella 灰姑娘, Snow White 白雪公主, Rapunzel 长发公主, Sleeping Beauty 睡美人, etc. The point is, these stories helped Germans feel more German, and that in turn 反过来 had an effect on 对…有影响 politics. +

Now, along those lines 沿着这些思路, after the French Revolution, it became clear to Europeans that revolution 革命, war, and rebellion 叛乱 demonstrated 展示 the emotional power that comes when people are united by nationalism and engage in 参与 mass politics 大众政治. So as Romanticism gained a foothold 获得立足之地 in Europe, these emotionally charged 充满情感的 tactics 策略；手段 would be used over and over again, because it was precisely 恰恰是 the emotion 情感 that the Romantics prized 珍视. +

Okay, back to literature. Romantic poets 浪漫主义诗人, while taking up 涉及 many different themes 主题, all seem to emphasize the love of nature. For example, British poet William Wordsworth 威廉·华兹华斯 believed that human beings had a kind of mystical 神秘的 connection to nature, and only by learning the depths of the created order 创造的秩序 could humans truly know themselves. He abandoned 摒弃 the structure 结构 and rigidity 僵化 of classical forms of poetry 古典诗歌形式 and instead wrote in ordinary language 普通语言, lifting up 提升 ordinary objects into a realm 领域 of glorious contemplation 美妙的沉思. +

And then visual artists 视觉艺术家 got caught up in 沉浸于；卷入 the Romantic spirit 浪漫主义精神 as well. Most of the visual arts of this movement basically shared two characteristics 特点: first, art is the outer manifestation 外在表现 of the artist's inner feelings 内心感受; and second, art must display 展现 emotion, warmth, and movement -- which of course is a fundamental 根本的 rejection of the neoclassical movement's emphasis on restraint 克制 and symmetry 对称. +

For example, here's Caspar David Friedrich's 卡斯帕·大卫·弗里德里希 painting Wanderer Above a Sea of Fog 《雾海上的旅人》. It's clear that Friedrich had a mystical view of nature -- like, you can feel that landscape 风景. But he also exhibits 展现 the emphasis on individualism 个人主义. Here's the singular 孤独的 wanderer 旅人 with his back toward the viewer, perhaps in contemplation 沉思, perhaps in awe 敬畏, but regardless 不管怎样, there is a sense of triumph 胜利 and trepidation 恐惧. +

And music was also changed by the Romantic movement as well. And perhaps no other composer 作曲家 did more to change it during this period than Ludwig van Beethoven 路德维希·凡·贝多芬. At the beginning of his career as a composer, Beethoven's music reflected 反映 the restrained 克制的 classicism 古典主义 of his teachers and influences. But by 1804, he was composing music squarely 明确地 in the Romantic strain 风格, which was able to produce fear and rapture 狂喜 and pain and longing 渴望 in his audiences 听众. So, you know, like real Romantic. +

Now, after the beating religion took during the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, Romanticism came in to revive 复兴 it. And perhaps there is no better illustration 例证 of this than the rise of Methodism 卫理公会派 in England. It was a movement founded by John Wesley 约翰·卫斯理, who was an Anglican priest 圣公会牧师. For years as a young priest, he struggled mightily 竭尽全力 to perform 履行 his Christian duties 基督教职责, even going so far as to 甚至 become a missionary 传教士 to England's American colony 殖民地. +

No matter how hard he tried to please God, no matter how strictly he attended to 专注于 his prayers 祈祷, Wesley was unable to escape the feelings of guilt 内疚感 before God. But one night in England, he attended a religious meeting 宗教集会, and as the minister 牧师 was reading a passage 段落 from Martin Luther 马丁·路德, Wesley had a profound 深刻的 experience. He said that his heart had been strangely warmed, and that he was convinced 使确信 by that experience -- and not by the mountain of good deeds 大量善举 that he had done -- that God had loved him. +

And that experience inflamed 激发 Wesley to go out preaching 宣讲 the gospel 福音. And he preached that his followers must have a real relationship with God through Christ, and the manner 方式 in which a person knows that they are a true Christian is by means of 通过 a powerful conversion experience 皈依体验 in which the saved person 得救的人 encounters 遇见 the living God in power. So it's pretty easy to see the Romantic strains 风格 of that. +

Anyway, the Methodist movement spread rapidly 迅速地 across England and then across Europe and then into America as well. +

== 中文释义

一种文化在人类内心跳出来说“兄弟，你也得感受些东西呀”之前，对启蒙理性主义的强调只能持续一段时间。所以在第五单元的结尾，我们将确切地看到浪漫主义的兴起是如何发生的。所以，如果你准备好充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。顺便说一下，我有这个视频的配套笔记，你可以在描述中的链接找到它们。  +

正如我们在第四单元谈到的，启蒙运动在18世纪主导了欧洲思想——至少在精英阶层中是这样，尽管它最终确实渗透到了大众之中。启蒙运动的关键重点是将理性、严谨的科学思想应用于每一个人类制度。所以这种思想带有一种冷漠、精于算计的氛围。启蒙思想家普遍认为，如果你不能用数学方法得出结论，或者不能用逻辑三段论证明结论，那么你实际上就无法真正了解它。  +

但浪漫主义在18世纪末兴起，挑战了这种解释世界的理性方式。根据定义，浪漫主义通过强调其他认知方式，如直觉和想象力，来平衡理性。此外，浪漫主义坚持个人主义，强调每个人独特特质的荣耀。  +

令人惊讶的是，我们实际上可以将这场运动的根源追溯到最伟大的启蒙思想家之一，即让 - 雅克·卢梭（Jean-Jacques Rousseau），他承认，理性作为解释世界的唯一手段，与他的观点多少有些矛盾。他与其他启蒙运动的同僚不同，他有时将情感和激情置于理性之上。他相信并教导说，上帝是仁慈的，人们可以通过情感与上帝相通，因此他与那些流氓自然神论者产生了分歧。他还强调自我和社会的道德提升。由于对主观性的强调，卢梭通常被视为浪漫主义运动的先驱。  +

所以在艺术方面，浪漫主义拒绝启蒙运动对理性的强调，也拒绝新古典主义对枯燥和控制的强调。浪漫主义强调情感的激昂、想象力的探索和自发性。你可以在浪漫主义文学中清楚地看到这种强调。  +

一些浪漫主义作家深深地热爱自己的民族和自己的历史，因此创作出了激发民族主义的作品。例如，格林兄弟（Grimm Brothers）收集了德国的童话故事和道德故事，并以《儿童与家庭童话集》（Children's and Household Tales）为名出版。我敢打赌你听过其中一些故事：《灰姑娘》《白雪公主》《长发公主》《睡美人》等等。重点是，这些故事让德国人更有民族认同感，反过来也对政治产生了影响。  +

沿着这些思路，法国大革命之后，欧洲人清楚地认识到，革命、战争和叛乱展示了人们因民族主义而团结起来并参与大众政治时所产生的情感力量。所以当浪漫主义在欧洲站稳脚跟时，这些充满情感的策略被反复使用，因为正是情感受到了浪漫主义者的珍视。  +

好的，回到文学方面。浪漫主义诗人虽然涉及许多不同的主题，但似乎都强调对自然的热爱。例如，英国诗人威廉·华兹华斯（William Wordsworth）认为，人类与自然有一种神秘的联系，只有了解被创造的秩序的深度，人类才能真正了解自己。他摒弃了古典诗歌形式的结构和僵化，而是用通俗语言写作，将普通的事物提升到一个值得赞美和沉思的境界。  +

然后视觉艺术家也沉浸在浪漫主义精神之中。这场运动的大多数视觉艺术作品基本上有两个共同特点：第一，艺术是艺术家内心感受的外在表现；第二，艺术必须展现情感、温暖和动感——这当然是对新古典主义运动强调克制和对称的根本否定。  +

例如，这是卡斯帕·大卫·弗里德里希（Caspar David Friedrich）的画作《雾海上的漫步者》（Wanderer Above a Sea of Fog）。很明显，弗里德里希对自然有一种神秘的看法——你可以感受到那片风景。但他也表现出对个人主义的强调。画中那个孤独的漫步者背对着观众，也许在沉思，也许带着敬畏之情，但无论如何，有一种胜利和恐惧的感觉。  +

音乐也因浪漫主义运动而发生了变化。在这个时期，也许没有其他作曲家比路德维希·凡·贝多芬（Ludwig van Beethoven）对音乐的改变更大。在他作为作曲家的职业生涯初期，贝多芬的音乐反映了他的老师和所受影响下的克制的古典主义风格。但到了1804年，他创作的音乐完全是浪漫主义风格，这种音乐能够在听众心中产生恐惧、狂喜、痛苦和渴望的情感。所以，你懂的，非常浪漫主义。  +

在启蒙运动和法国大革命期间宗教受到冲击之后，浪漫主义的出现使宗教得以复兴。也许没有比英国卫理公会（Methodism）的兴起更好的例子了。这是由圣公会牧师约翰·卫斯理（John Wesley）创立的一场运动。作为一名年轻的牧师，多年来他一直努力履行自己的基督教职责，甚至远赴英国在美洲的殖民地传教。  +

无论他多么努力地取悦上帝，无论他多么严格地祈祷，卫斯理都无法摆脱在上帝面前的罪恶感。但在英国的一个晚上，他参加了一次宗教集会，当牧师宣读马丁·路德（Martin Luther）的一段话时，卫斯理有了一次深刻的体验。他说他的心奇怪地温暖起来，而且他被这次经历说服了——而不是被他所做的大量善举说服——上帝是爱他的。  +

那次经历激励卫斯理出去传福音。他宣扬他的追随者必须通过基督与上帝建立真正的关系，而一个人知道自己是真正的基督徒的方式，是通过一次强大的皈依体验，在这种体验中，被拯救的人能有力地遇见活着的上帝。所以很容易看出其中的浪漫主义倾向。  +

不管怎样，卫理公会运动迅速在英国传播，然后传播到欧洲，接着也传播到了美国。  +
