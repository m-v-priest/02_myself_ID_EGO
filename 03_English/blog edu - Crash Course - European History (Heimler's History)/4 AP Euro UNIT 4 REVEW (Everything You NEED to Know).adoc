== 释义

Are you struggling to understand everything you need to know for AP European History Unit Four 美国大学预修课程欧洲历史第四单元? You know I got you, boo （俚语，兄弟；伙计）. Well, I'm Steve Heimler, and I'm here to help you get an A in your class and a five on your exam in May. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then let's get to it. +

So this unit is in large part 很大程度上 all about Europe's thinking people and how their ideas changed the social, political, and economic landscape 格局 of the continent 欧洲大陆. So I reckon 认为 we ought to start with the advances in science, which is to say the Scientific Revolution 科学革命. Now there are three big categories of change during this time, all of them emerging out of 源于 this new emphasis on Renaissance humanism 文艺复兴人文主义: astronomy 天文学, medicine 医学, and reasoning 推理. +

With respect to 关于 astronomy, which is the study of the physical universe 宇宙, let me first tell you what the prevailing view 主流观点 of the universe was, and then I'll tell you how it changed. Ancient Greeks like Aristotle 亚里士多德 and Ptolemy 托勒密 developed a geocentric model 地心说模型 of the universe which put the Earth at the center of everything. Every other body 天体 in the galaxy 星系 circled around the Earth, including the sun. And this was the assumed understanding of the celestial spheres 天球 throughout medieval Europe 中世纪欧洲. And it's important to know that this was also the Catholic Church's view 天主教会的观点. +

But during our period, three guys came along and took a massive empirical dump all over the prevailing view 从根本上颠覆了主流观点. The first was Nicolas Copernicus 尼古拉·哥白尼. Through complex mathematics 复杂的数学运算, Copernicus challenged the geocentric view of the universe and instead put forth 提出 the heliocentric view 日心说 which said that the sun was at the center, and the Earth, along with all the other heavenly bodies 天体 on display in the sky, revolved around the sun 围绕太阳公转. Additionally, he was able to demonstrate 证明 that the reason it appears that the sun is rising and setting 日出日落 is because the Earth itself spins upon its axis 绕轴自转. And look, he'd have to do that with complex mathematics because that is not at all how it looks to the naked eye 肉眼看来并非如此. +

Then came Johannes Kepler 约翰内斯·开普勒. He built upon 基于 Copernicus's model by again doing complex mathy stuff 复杂的数学运算, and he accomplished two things. First, Kepler affirmed 证实 Copernicus's claim that the sun was at the center of our galaxy 银河系. Second, he found that planets orbited the sun not in perfect circles 正圆 but rather in ellipses 椭圆. +

And third, you need to know Galileo Galilei 伽利略·伽利莱. You see, both Copernicus and Kepler came to their conclusions mainly by mapping them out with their thinky thinky parts （幽默表达，通过思考）, but Galileo took those conclusions even further by taking them out of the brain and instead using his eyeballs （幽默表达，通过观察）. He built a contraption 装置 called a telescope 望远镜 which allowed the human eye to see far greater distances into space 观测到更远的太空. Now he didn't invent the telescope, but he did build one for himself. And with the telescope, Galileo was able to observe in detail 详细观测 the moons of different planets 行星的卫星, and he was able to prove that those other planets weren't celestial bodies of light 发光的天体 as had previously been believed, but rather they were made out of the same stuff as Earth 与地球由相同物质构成. +

Now as each of these men did their work, they were overturning 推翻 previous assumptions about how the cosmos 宇宙 worked. And presumably 大概 it won't surprise you to know that the Catholic Church was none too happy about this 对此很不满. Many of these developments were occurring during the Catholic Reformation 天主教改革, and if you'll remember when we talked about that back in Unit 2, you'll remember that one of the products of this reform movement was a list of banned books 禁书目录. Well, Copernicus and Kepler's books ended up on those lists. And why is that? Well, because according to their reading of the Bible 根据他们对《圣经》的解读, Aristotelian cosmology 亚里士多德宇宙观 squared nicely with 与……相符 scriptural accounts of the cosmos 《圣经》对宇宙的描述. Genesis 1 says that the Earth is set upon foundations 地球有根基 and that there is a firmament 苍穹 in the sky dividing the earthly realm 尘世 from the heavenly realm 天国, which is to say, by the church's reckoning 据教会的理解, the Bible put the Earth at the center of the created order 上帝创造的秩序中心. So these new ideas from Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo challenged not only well-vetted ancients like Aristotle and Ptolemy 权威古人 -- they were suggesting that the Bible got it wrong with respect to the ordering of the cosmos 宇宙的秩序. And if European history teaches us anything, it teaches us that if you start telling the church it's getting something wrong, you're about to get burned （比喻，惹上麻烦）. +

Anyway, the church put Kepler and Copernicus on their prohibited books list 禁书名单. Despite the fact that Galileo was a deeply committed Catholic himself 虔诚的天主教徒, the Pope went ahead and charged him with heresy 异端罪, and Galileo was forced to spend the rest of his days under house arrest 软禁. But his works were published after his death, and as it turned out 结果证明, he was right. +

Okay, that was what was happening in the world of astronomy 天文学界. Now let's shift 转换话题 and talk about the advances that were happening in medicine and anatomy 医学与解剖学. And the same thing was happening here. Ancient Greek understandings of the human body and medicine 古希腊对人体和医学的认知 were being overturned 颠覆 by the thinky thinky people （幽默表达，有思想的人）. So what was the prevailing view in these fields 领域? For that, let me introduce you to our boy Galen 盖伦. He was an ancient Greek whose work in anatomy and physiology 解剖学与生理学 was widely accepted throughout medieval Europe 中世纪欧洲广泛接受. Galen advanced 提出 what he called the humoral theory of the body 体液学说. Basically it said that the body was composed of 由……组成 four kinds of substances or humors 体液, and those substances were blood 血液, yellow bile 黄胆汁, black bile 黑胆汁, and phlegm 黏液. If you're listening closely, that means according to Galen, about 25% of your body is made up of phlegm 由黏液组成. Anyway, according to Galen, when these four humors were in balance 平衡, the body was healthy, but when they got out of balance 失衡, that was the cause for sickness and disease 疾病的原因. +

But just like in the cosmological realm 宇宙领域, new thinkers came along in this period to challenge Galen's theory, and they developed a new understanding based on observation and experimentation 观察与实验. Now the first name you should know is Paracelsus 帕拉塞尔苏斯, and he rejected 摒弃 the humoral theory of disease 疾病体液学说 and claimed that it was chemical imbalance 化学失衡 that caused disease. And if that was true, then chemical remedies 化学药物 could solve those imbalances 解决失衡问题. So for example, if a person has dry, flaky skin 皮肤干燥起皮 and is tired all the time 总是疲惫, that's a sign not that the humors were out of balance, but instead that the body had a chemical imbalance -- in this case, an iron deficiency 缺铁. Galen would have seen those symptoms 症状 and drain some blood out of the person to bring the humors back into balance 放血使体液恢复平衡, but Paracelsus argued that a person should be given more iron 补铁. Totally obvious to us, but it was revolutionary back then 当时是革命性的观点. +

The second name you should know is William Harvey 威廉·哈维, who further overturned Galen's ideas, this time about the circulation of blood 血液循环. Galen thought that there were two different systems of blood contained in the body 体内有两套血液系统 and that they did not interact with one another 互不流通. Harvey, on the other hand 另一方面, through experimentation 通过实验, discovered that the circulatory system 循环系统 was one integrated whole 一个完整的整体. Blood is pumped out of the heart 心脏泵血 through the body and returns to the heart to do the whole thing over again 流回心脏循环往复. +

And finally, new methods of reasoning 推理方法 were being developed during this period, and again this was done based on mathematics and empirical experimentation 数学和实证实验. Francis Bacon 弗朗西斯·培根 argued that knowledge came by empirical research 实证研究, and he was the pioneer of inductive reasoning 归纳推理. This meant that if you wanted to know about anything, Bacon argued, you started by observing the smallest parts of the thing 观察事物的最小部分 and then moved to general principles from there 得出一般原理. René Descartes 勒内·笛卡尔 was known for championing 倡导 deductive reasoning 演绎推理. Descartes started with the largest possible principles 最大的原理 -- like those things that cannot be doubted 不容置疑的事物, for example, everything is made of matter 万物由物质构成 -- from those big ideas, then you could work your way down to knowledge of the specifics 推导出具体知识. Either way, both of these men were among the first major players 重要人物 in challenging the dominance of ancient Greek philosophy 挑战古希腊哲学的主导地位 and developing the basis for a new means of understanding the world 理解世界的新方式, namely the scientific method 科学方法, which emphasized observation and experimentation in order to understand the physical world 强调通过观察和实验理解物质世界. +

Now despite these massive innovations 重大创新 in how humans understood the world and the world beyond them, older beliefs continued to persist 旧观念依然存在. For example, most of the innovators 创新者 that I just mentioned continued to believe in God and that the world was ruled and influenced by spiritual forces 精神力量. A good portion of the folks 很多人 blowing our minds about how the cosmos were actually situated 颠覆我们对宇宙认知的人 continued to believe in practice in astrology 占星术, which is the study of how the position of heavenly bodies influenced human events 天体位置对人类事务的影响. Furthermore, they continued the pursuit of alchemy 炼金术, which was the kind of pseudoscience 伪科学 that attempted to turn certain metals into gold 把金属变成黄金. So it's really important for you to remember that the scientific view of the world did not come in to replace the more magical view of the world all at once 科学世界观并非一蹴而取代魔幻世界观. +

Okay, so the Enlightenment 启蒙运动 was a movement built upon 基于 the radical shift in thought 思想的根本转变 that occurred during the Scientific Revolution. Enlightenment thinkers 启蒙思想家 applied those new methods of reasoning 推理方法 to politics, society, and human institutions 政治、社会和人类制度. And in doing so, they similarly overturned 颠覆 many of the ideas that were accepted as gospel truth 奉为真理的观念. And it's no shock that the Enlightenment began in France 启蒙运动始于法国. This was the state with the strongest absolutist government 专制政府, and the people were sick of the control imposed upon them by the French monarchy 受够了君主统治. And so a lot of the new ideas in the Enlightenment started as reactions against that kind of absolutism 作为对专制主义的反抗. +

So with respect to 关于 society and human institutions, let me introduce you to two of the French philosophers 法国哲学家. First, and probably most important, was Voltaire 伏尔泰. Now that wasn't his real name, but like Madonna and Beyoncé, he was bad enough to go by one name （幽默表达，只用一个名字就很有名）. Voltaire was easily the most famous and representative of the French philosophers 法国哲学家的代表人物. He produced voluminous writings 大量作品 in many different genres 体裁 that all had one thing in common: criticism of the social and religious institutions of France 对法国社会和宗教制度的批判. One of his most biting criticisms 尖锐批判 concerned the religious intolerance 宗教不宽容 that he observed in France. He spent some time in England, and he saw that because so many competing versions of religion were allowed 多种宗教并存, they were able to exist peacefully 和平共处. By contrast 相比之下, in France where Catholicism was forcibly imposed upon the population 天主教强制推行, Voltaire viewed it as oppression 压迫. Now he did believe in natural rights 自然权利 and argued for reforms in education and free speech 教育改革和言论自由, but he did not believe that people were capable of governing themselves 自治 because, let's be honest, the massive people are selfish, ignorant turds （俚语，自私无知的家伙）, and thus they needed a strong, enlightened monarch 开明君主 to rule them. +

Okay, the second French philosopher you need to know is Denis Diderot 德尼·狄德罗. Not Dennis -- that's the guy who sells you beepers in the subway station （幽默表达，区分名字） -- Denis. Anyway, Diderot sought to catalog 编纂目录 the whole body of knowledge according to Enlightenment principles 启蒙原则. To this end 为此, he edited and published the incredibly influential Encyclopedia 《百科全书》, whose subtitle tells you everything you need to know about this work: The Rational Dictionary of the Sciences, the Arts, and the Crafts 《科学、艺术和工艺理性词典》. First, emphasis on rational 强调理性. Second, emphasis on the sciences, the arts, and the crafts 科学、艺术和工艺. In other words, a rational explanation of everything 对万物的理性解释. Diderot gathered leading thinkers 召集顶尖思想家 to produce over 72,000 entries 条目 for the Encyclopedia, and the result was revolutionary 具有革命性. Science and rationalistic ways of knowing 科学和理性认知方式 were exalted 推崇 while religion was poo-poo'd （俚语，轻视）. The writers criticized old social institutions and religious intolerance 批判旧制度和宗教不宽容, and in general, this set of volumes summed up the whole worldview of the Enlightenment 总结了启蒙运动的世界观. And maybe it goes without saying 不言而喻, but the French government was not a big fan of such work 不喜欢这类作品 because those thinkers seemed to want to take their power away 削弱其权力. +

Now Enlightenment thinkers were also responsible for new ways of thinking about God 对上帝的新思考. Voltaire developed deism 自然神论, which argued that there was a God but that God did not intervene in human affairs 干预人类事务. Instead, God was like a cosmic clockmaker 宇宙钟表匠 that put all the pieces in place 设定好一切, wound the thing up 上紧发条, and then just let it tick away 任其运转. And this of course meant that the miracle stories of the Bible 圣经中的奇迹故事 were cast out 摒弃 as relics of an unenlightened past 蒙昧时代的产物. Deists argued that God ruled the world by unchanging laws of physics 物理定律, not by performing miracles which defied those laws 违背定律的奇迹. Diderot was also a deist 自然神论者, and as such did not agree with organized religion 不认同有组织的宗教. And remember, both Voltaire and Diderot are living in France, which is a Catholic state 天主教国家. And because religion and politics were so closely bound up 紧密相连 there, to say anything against religion was to call into question the state as well 质疑国家. So you know, things got tense 局势紧张. +

Additionally, Diderot defined atheism 无神论 in his Encyclopedia as someone who knows about God and consciously rejects God's existence 有意识地否认上帝存在. If someone was an atheist 无神论者, that meant that there was no God and that anything that could be known was understood not by revelation 启示 but through human senses interacting with the material world 通过感官与物质世界互动. I should also mention another guy under this heading 在此话题下, namely the Scottish thinker David Hume 苏格兰思想家大卫·休谟. He developed the philosophy of skepticism 怀疑主义哲学, which argued that the ideas in our brains only reflect our sensory inputs 感官输入. Therefore, reason cannot convince us of anything beyond what our senses can interpret 理性无法超越感官认知. Or to say it another way 换句话说, the only thing a person can know for sure 确定知晓 is what that person experiences through their senses 通过感官体验到的事物. And that way, skepticism leads a person to question everything 质疑一切, including questioning the dogmas of the church 教会教条. +

I hope you can start to see a theme here 看出规律. So much of what occurred during the Enlightenment chipped away 削弱 not only at the absolute power of political authority 政治权威 but absolute religious authority as well 宗教权威. Now one of the most significant results of these new ideas about religion 宗教新观念 was this: religion was increasingly viewed as a matter of private rather than public concern 宗教更多被视为私人事务而非公共事务. And to be clear 明确地说, this was the view that people who were not kings began to hold 非王权阶层的观点. As should be clear from this in the previous units 从上一单元可知, absolutist monarchs 专制君主 very much thought that religion was a public concern 视宗教为公共事务. But on the ground level among the people 民众层面, this began to shift 转变 as structures of society grew increasingly secular 社会日益世俗化. The religious emphasis moved from public belonging 公共归属 to private belonging 私人归属. Like if someone were to ask you if you were a Christian before the Enlightenment and you lived in a Christian state 在启蒙运动前的基督教国家, the answer would be yes -- like, I'm a citizen of England and therefore I'm a Christian 因为是英国公民所以是基督徒. But new revival movements 复兴运动 began to emphasize personal conversion 个人皈依, not state belonging 国家归属, as the litmus test for true belief 检验信仰的标准. +

A good example of this was the religious revival of German Pietism 德国虔敬主义 in the 17th and 18th century, led by Count Nicolas von Zinzendorf 尼古拉斯・冯・青岑多夫伯爵. Pietism taught that true religious experience was not just about belonging to a church 属于某个教会 but rather was bound up in 与…… 紧密相连 a mystical, personal religious experience 神秘的个人宗教体验. Now in much of Germany, of course, Lutheranism 路德宗 was the accepted religion, but Zinzendorf reacted strongly against the rationalistic approach to Christ 对基督的理性主义态度 that they had preached. In fact, he once said, "He who wishes to comprehend God with his mind becomes an atheist." So you know, he was kind of a moderate （反讽，有点极端）. +

Okay, so not only are people conceiving of 构想 new ways of thinking about God, but others are applying this kind of rational postulation 理性假设 towards politics as well. For this, let me introduce you to John Locke 约翰・洛克. In order to understand the thinking of John Locke, you need to understand the concept of natural rights 自然权利. This is the idea that human beings, just by virtue of being human beings 仅仅因为是人，possess rights like life 生命权，and liberty 自由权，and property 财产权. These, according to Locke, are given by the creator 造物主，which is to say God. And this was a big deal 意义重大 because if humans had been given rights by God, then that meant that those rights did not come from a monarch or a government 非来自君主或政府. And that further means that a monarch or government could not take those rights away 不能剥夺这些权利. And even further, that meant that the power of the state actually originated with the people 国家权力源于人民，which is an idea called popular sovereignty 人民主权. So if that's true, then the people can only be governed by their own consent 经人民同意而统治 and not the divine right of kings 君权神授. No? Oh yes. +

And remember back to the last unit when we talked about the English Civil War 英国内战 and the Glorious Revolution 光荣革命. William and Mary 威廉和玛丽 assumed the throne of England 登上英国王位 but only on the condition that they signed the English Bill of Rights 英国《权利法案》. And that tastes like some John Locke sauce to me （比喻，充满洛克思想的味道）. +

And then there was Jean-Jacques Rousseau 让 - 雅克・卢梭. And to be fair 公平地说，Rousseau had several overlapping ideas 观点有交叉，but I'm only going to tell you the ideas for which they're most known 最著名的观点. You need to associate Rousseau with the idea of the social contract 社会契约论. If people really did have natural rights, then when they establish a government in order to protect those rights 为保护权利建立政府，they are entering into a social contract with that government 与政府订立社会契约. And there are two sides to that contract 契约有双方. The people willingly surrender some of their power 让渡部分权力 to create a government, and they do that so that the government will then protect their natural rights 保护自然权利. And the assumption here is that the government will act in accordance with what the people want 按人民意愿行事，and Rousseau's term for that was the general will 公意. And if the government fails to do that 未履行契约，then the people have the right to dissolve the contract 解除契约 and install a new government 建立新政府. If you're an American and that sounds familiar 美国人对此熟悉，it's because those ideas are written into our Declaration of Independence 写入《独立宣言》. +

And just for boobs and giggles （俚语，开玩笑地）, you should know that Rousseau argued that men and women were fundamentally different kinds of beings 本质上不同 and thus rigid gender roles 严格的性别角色 should be applied to each. Women should be subordinate to men 从属于男性 because, after all, who is going to make the man a sandwich if not the woman? His words, not mine （强调是卢梭的观点）. And further, those women that have children should remain in the home to raise them 在家育儿. +



Now Mary Wollstonecraft 玛丽·沃斯通克拉夫特, who was an English writer 作家 and philosopher 哲学家, not surprisingly vehemently 强烈地 opposed these rigid 僵化的 gender categories 性别分类. In opposition to 反对 her, so she wrote The Vindication of the Rights of Women 女权辩护, in which she argued that women are not in fact inherently 本质上 inferior 低等的 to men, but in whatever way women seem to be inferior, it's only because education 教育 and opportunity 机会 have been denied 拒绝给予 to them on account of 由于 their sex 性别.

And then it was our boy Adam Smith 亚当·斯密 who applied Enlightenment thinking 启蒙思想 to economics 经济学. In his book The Wealth of Nations《国富论》, Smith attacked the mercantilist policies 重商主义政策 of many European nations. He argued that governments ought to get their filthy hands out of （习语，远离；不插手）the economy and instead let people make economic decisions based on the laws of supply and demand 供求法则. In this way, the invisible hand 看不见的手（经济学术语）of the free market 自由市场 would increase the prosperity 繁荣 of nations and abandon mercantilist economic policies 重商主义经济政策. Again, this is not just thinking thinking stuff （口语化表达，不只是空想）. To criticize mercantilism 重商主义 was to criticize the economic system of choice 选择的经济体系 for absolutist monarchies 专制君主制. +

Okay, so now I've given you a brief sketch 简要概述 of some of the major ideas coming out of the Enlightenment 启蒙运动, but let's take a moment to consider how those ideas spread. And the first way they spread -- wait, you should know this -- in what way did any idea spread across Europe over the last few units? Uh, the printing press 印刷术. That is correct. Me from the other camera, the printing press helps spread Enlightenment ideas 启蒙思想. But there were also new institutions 机构 that were developed specifically to discuss and spread Enlightenment ideas. And the most significant of these was the salon 沙龙. Nope, not that salon. That's a lot. Basically, salons were private meetings 私人聚会 held in opulent houses 豪华住宅 where the intelligentsia 知识分子 openly discussed and debated these new ideas of the day 当时的新思想. Many of the most well - known salons were hosted by women. For example, Madame du Deffand 杜德芳夫人 who held a weekly salon in her home. +

But hold on just a second 等一下. You have to understand not just that the ideas spread, but you need to understand why it was important that these ideas were spreading. The more they spread, the more people began to grow dissatisfied with 对……不满 the prevailing political institutions 现行政治制度. And that dissatisfaction is going to have consequences 产生后果 in the next unit in the form of the American, French, and Haitian revolutions 美国、法国和海地革命. Now you didn't think the Enlightenment wasn't gonna have influence over power structures 权力结构, did you? You're so crazy. +

Now remember that the last development in political power we considered was absolutism 专制主义, by which monarchs 君主 sought to consolidate 巩固 as much power as possible under themselves. In some cases, this led to religious intolerance 宗教不宽容, as is the case of France under Louis XIV 路易十四统治下的法国. And in other cases, it led to relentless territorial expansion 无休止的领土扩张, as is the case of France under Louis XIV. But the proliferation 扩散 of Enlightenment thought 启蒙思想 influenced the absolutist movement 专制主义运动. Some monarchs sought to become enlightened absolutists 开明专制君主, and you should know a few names here. But before I introduce you to them, let me make clear 明确说明 two things about the enlightened portion of their title. First, they acted in enlightened ways 以开明的方式 when it benefited them. And second, they were very short - sighted 目光短浅的 in the reforms that they enacted 实施. In general, they only looked to the immediate impact 直接影响 of those reforms which should help them stay in power 维持权力 and not to the long - term impact 长期影响 which would make the people want more rights, which ultimately would hurt the power of the monarchy in the long run 从长远来看损害君主制的权力. Okay, caveat 警告 done. Now let me introduce these folks to you. +

First was Frederick II of Prussia 普鲁士的腓特烈二世, otherwise known as Frederick the Great 腓特烈大帝. Recall 回想 that the Peace of Westphalia 威斯特伐利亚和约 recognized the sovereignty 主权 of the individual states of the Holy Roman Empire 神圣罗马帝国, and that had the effect of weakening the empire 削弱帝国. Instead of one emperor ruling over all, now there were 300 sovereigns 君主 vying for power 争夺权力. In this context 背景下, Prussia rose to power 崛起 under the leadership of Frederick, who made Prussia one of the leading military forces 主要军事力量 in all of Europe. So what made Frederick all enlightened and whatnot 诸如此类的开明之处? Well, he was concerned that he would serve his people well 为人民服务 well and considered himself not their dictator 独裁者 but rather their benefactor 恩人. And you can surely see the Enlightenment influence there. Additionally, Frederick patronized 资助 the philosophers, and by Voltaire's reckoning 据伏尔泰的判断, Frederick was deemed 被认为 a philosopher king 哲学王. He also increased the freedom of speech 言论自由 in the press 新闻界, and he reformed the judicial system 司法制度 to eliminate class differences under the law 消除法律下的阶级差异. But remember, it's not as if he's doing all this out of the goodness of his own heart 出于好心. Many of these reforms are undermining 削弱 the nobility 贵族 in Prussia, and that helps consolidate power under Frederick. +

Okay, another enlightened absolutist 开明专制君主 you should know is Catherine II of Russia 俄罗斯的叶卡捷琳娜二世, better known as Catherine the Great 叶卡捷琳娜大帝. And what was so enlightened about her? Well, she reformed the penal system 刑法制度 to outlaw torture 禁止酷刑 and capital punishment 死刑, reformed education 教育, and patronized the arts 资助艺术. To be fair 公平地说, she did grow more conservative later in her reign 在她统治后期变得更加保守, but all in all 总的来说, she falls into the category of 属于 enlightened absolutists 开明专制君主. But again, the reason she was doing all this was to maintain her power 维持权力. Catherine, like Frederick in Prussia, enacted 实施 an awful lot of reforms that undermined the nobility. And where is that power gonna go? Catherine. +

Now, enlightened or not, by 1800 most governments in western and central Europe had increased their religious toleration 宗教宽容 to Christian minorities 基督教少数派 and Jews 犹太人. A big influence on this was John Locke's insistence of the separation of church and state 政教分离. If the state no longer controlled the church, then it was no longer a threat to a monarch's power 对君主权力构成威胁 for his or her subjects 臣民 to hold different beliefs 持有不同信仰. For example, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen 人权宣言, written in 1789, proclaimed 宣布 religious freedom 宗教自由 for all French citizens. Catherine the Great over in Russia recognized Jews as Russian subjects 俄罗斯臣民 and extended 给予 more civil liberties 公民自由 to them under the Charter of Towns 城镇宪章 in 1782. Now Jews were still basically second - class citizens 二等公民 during Catherine's rule, but regardless 无论如何, they did make some gains 取得一些进步 during this time. +

Okay, now we've talked a lot about what was going on during this period in the upper echelons of society 社会上层, but now it's time to look at what was going on down below in general society 普通社会. Now during this period, we're going to witness 见证 a rapid transition 快速转变 between pre - industrial Europe 前工业化欧洲 and post - industrial Europe 后工业化欧洲. Now the first of the major transitions we need to talk about is with respect to 关于 food and the population. There was a dramatic increase 急剧增长 in population during this period due to two factors. Birth rates 出生率 were slowly increasing, but thanks to advances in medicine 医学进步, death rates 死亡率 were simultaneously decreasing 同时下降. Not only were way more infants surviving childhood 婴儿存活下来, but people were healthier and stronger and therefore living longer lives 寿命更长. Add to that the bubonic plague 黑死病, which killed massive amounts of people in the 14th century and then went away and then came back over and over again, just suddenly died out 消失. Historians dispute 争论 why that happened, but the point is without the Black Death 黑死病, more people were living into older age 活到老年. Additionally, smallpox 天花 was another deadly disease 致命疾病 that frequently killed large portions of the population 大量人口, but thanks to Edward Jenner's new vaccine against smallpox 天花疫苗, much of the sting was taken out of this disease 减弱了疾病的危害, and thus it killed less people. +

So babies are surviving infancy 婴儿期, people are living longer, and hey, that sounds like a good thing, right? Well, not if you're Thomas Malthus 托马斯·马尔萨斯. He observed that while the population rate 人口增长率 was increasing, the food supply 粮食供应 was not going to keep up with it 跟上增长. And that meant that unless either the population was cut off 控制人口 or there was some way to increase the food supply 增加粮食供应, then the result would be massive amounts of death by starvation 大量饿死. So you know, not the kind of guy you want to invite to your kids' bar mitzvah 成人礼. "You know, I'm really glad that Dave is becoming a man today, but in the long run it doesn't really matter because everybody's gonna die of starvation." +

Anyway, as it turns out 结果是, Europeans did solve the food problem in a series of events that became known as the Agricultural Revolution 农业革命. During this period, more land became available for farming 可用于耕种. For example, in places like England and the Netherlands, they built dikes 堤坝 and drained wetlands 排干湿地 in order to plant more food. And also, advances in crop rotation 作物轮作 yielded more abundant crops 产量更高. Instead of letting a portion of land lie fallow 休耕, farmers discovered that planting crops like beans and clover 豆类和三叶草 would replenish the soil 补充土壤养分, and that meant that all the land was productive 多产的, not just part of it. Additionally, there were advances in agricultural technology 农业技术 that contributed to this revolution 推动了革命. Europeans began selective breeding of livestock 牲畜选择性育种, combining the best specimens of animals 优良品种 in order to yield better quality livestock 培育出更优质的牲畜. Also, there was Jethro Tull's seed drill 条播机, which planted seeds with precision 精确地 deep in the soil so that the wind couldn't blow them away 吹走种子, which had the effect of increasing crop yields 提高作物产量. And better transportation systems 运输系统 were built in many states as well. Canals were linked and expanded 运河连接和扩建, roads were improved 道路改善, and bridges were reinforced 桥梁加固. All of this made it cheaper and more efficient 更便宜高效 to transport food to the growing population 不断增长的人口. +

However, in all this talk about population explosion 人口爆炸, I should mention at least one pattern that hindered 阻碍 population growth, and that's the European marriage pattern 婚姻模式. With a new emphasis on the nuclear family 核心家庭, which was a separate entity 实体 from the extended family 大家庭, people were marrying later and later 结婚越来越晚. And that's because in order to create a new family unit 家庭单元, you had to have enough wealth and resources 财富和资源 to start their own independent family 独立家庭, and that took time. So people began marrying later, and women were having fewer babies 生育更少孩子. Even so 即便如此, you should also know that during this period, the rate of babies born to unwed parents 未婚父母生育孩子的比例 spiked dramatically 急剧上升. These were known as illegitimate births 非婚生育, and what this indicated 表明 is that people were having way more uh, intimate relations 亲密关系 outside of marriage than was previously the case 以往情况. But don't worry, there was still a significant social stigma 社会耻辱 against unwed mothers giving birth outside of marriage 未婚生育, and many of them had to turn to prostitution 卖淫 as a result. +

Speaking of 说到 families and children, as infant and child mortality 婴儿和儿童死亡率 decreased and families had more disposable income 可支配收入, families began dedicating more space and time to children 投入更多空间和时间给孩子. And children -- in fact, the thinking thinking people 有思想的人 were starting to pontificate on 高谈阔论 childhood 童年 as well. Jean - Jacques Rousseau 让 - 雅克·卢梭 argued that children were a separate kind of being 独特的存在 and that their childhood should be elevated 重视 by attentive parents 细心的父母 and therefore they should be playing before they got thrown into the adult world of work 进入成人工作世界之前玩耍. And this was a massive shift 巨大转变 in how people thought about children 对孩子的看法. Like, before this period, children were just seen as small - sized adults 小大人. So they worked like adults, and they were disciplined severely 严厉管教. But during this period, notions of childhood change 童年观念改变. For example, Napoleon 拿破仑 -- on whom much more in Unit 5 -- established a school system 学校制度 in France in 1802 which used a common curriculum 通用课程 to turn children into more well - rounded citizens 全面发展的公民. +

Okay, so that's what was going on with food and families, but we also needed to talk about another significant social change during this period, namely 即 the large - scale migration 大规模迁移 of people from rural areas 农村地区 to urban areas 城市地区. Largely because of technological advances 技术进步 like the steel plow 铁犁 and the seed drill 条播机, fewer workers were required on farms 农场需要更少工人. Therefore, in order to find work, many rural folks 农村人口 moved to the city, a process known as urbanization 城市化. But as this began to occur on a large scale 大规模发生, cities were crushed by the onslaught of 受到……冲击 people streaming in 涌入城市, and that created some problems. First, there wasn't enough housing 住房 for all these people. So to solve that problem, a new kind of housing was created called the tenement 廉价公寓. These were hastily constructed 匆忙建造的 apartment buildings which had rooms that workers could rent for a pretty low price 低价租用. However, they were not well ventilated 通风不好, and there was no indoor plumbing 室内管道设施. The poor ventilation 通风不良 meant that airborne diseases 空气传播疾病 like tuberculosis 肺结核 could spread rapidly 迅速传播. No indoor plumbing meant that people had to take their waste 垃圾 and throw it out the window onto the street 扔到街上. So needless to say 不用说, the cities were, to use the technical historical term, a stanky （口语化表达，脏乱差）. And so with all these working poor 贫困工人 crowding into the cities, other urban residents 城市居民 were faced with the problems of poverty 贫困问题 like crime 犯罪 and prostitution 卖淫. +

In order to address these problems 解决这些问题, authorities 当局 passed laws meant to eradicate them 消除问题. A good example is England's Contagious Disease Act of 1864 1864年英国《传染病法》. This law was meant to crack down on 打击 prostitution 卖淫. Like if a woman was suspected of such licentiousness 淫乱行为, she would be arrested and subjected to 遭受 forced bodily inspections 强制身体检查 to determine if she was carrying a venereal disease 性病. If so, she was put in a high - security hospital 高安全医院 and treated like a prisoner 像囚犯一样对待. +

Okay, in the final section, let's consider how European cultural and intellectual life 文化和知识生活 was maintained and changed throughout this period. First, let me tell you about the reading revolution 阅读革命. Due to the increasing influence of the printing press 印刷术, people began reading at a rate that far exceeded 远超 anything that came before it. Not only did the amount of books increase 书籍数量增加, but the kinds of books began to vary widely 种类繁多 as well. For example, in France, the number of religious devotional books 宗教灵修书籍 began to decrease, and books on history, and law, and science, and the arts 历史、法律、科学和艺术书籍 began to increase rapidly. So with all these new ideas floating around 传播, censorship 审查制度 increased to keep them at bay 抑制. And mainly the censors 审查者 were religious. For example, the Catholic Church 天主教会 sanctioned 制裁 Diderot's Encyclopedia 狄德罗《百科全书》for its brazen questioning of religious authority 公然质疑宗教权威. But even with the attempts at censorship 审查, the reading revolution took hold 扎根, and people were reading more than ever 前所未有的多. +

It wasn't only books that people were reading. There was an explosion of 大量涌现 newspapers and periodicals 期刊 and pamphlets 小册子 as well. Enlightenment thinkers 启蒙思想家, natural scientists 自然科学家, and explorers 探险家 traveled the globe 环游世界 during this period, and as they returned, they wrote down their observations 观察记录. And that had two effects. First, it exposed 使接触 the literate European population 有文化的欧洲人 to cultures outside their own 外部文化. Second, some of these depictions 描述 challenged Europeans' accepted social norms 社会规范. For example, explorers who wrote about the indigenous societies 土著社会 in the Americas 美洲 showed that they were not as rigidly hierarchical 严格等级制度 as European societies. +

In terms of 就……而言 art, the emphasis 重点 shifted on the celebration of religious themes 宗教主题 and royal power of kings 王权 to the private life 私人生活 and the public good 公共利益. Until about 1750, art in the Baroque style 巴洛克风格 promoted religious feeling 宗教情感 and was employed by monarchs 君主 to illustrate state power 展示国家权力. It was a style that sought to awe people 使人们惊叹 with its opulence 华丽 and detail 细节 and ostentatious features 炫耀性特征. For example, Gian Lorenzo Bernini 詹洛伦佐·贝尼尼 sculpted magnificent piazzas 雕刻宏伟的广场 and designed ornate chapels 华丽的小教堂 for the renovation of Saint Peter's Basilica 圣彼得大教堂翻新. Johann Sebastian Bach 约翰·塞巴斯蒂安·巴赫 wrote many of his compositions 作品 to  be performed in a royal court 宫廷 or high church services 高级教堂仪式. But in the 18th century, the nature and subject matter 主题 of art shifted from the state and religious themes to themes that appealed to 吸引 the bourgeois society 资产阶级，which is to say the middle class 中产阶级. This new style of art was called Neoclassicism 新古典主义. In contrast to 与…… 形成对比 the opulence and the grandeur 宏伟 of Baroque, Neoclassical artists prized 珍视 simplicity 简洁 and symmetry 对称. This was especially emphasized in literature 文学领域. You had Daniel Defoe 丹尼尔・笛福 who wrote Robinson Crusoe《鲁滨逊漂流记》. It's the story of a man shipwrecked 遭遇海难 on an island who learns to survive and thrive 生存繁衍 and does all of this without any guidance from religious authority or Christian doctrine 基督教教义. You also had Jane Austen 简・奥斯汀 who wrote Sense and Sensibility《理智与情感》and Pride and Prejudice《傲慢与偏见》. Her stories were concerned with 涉及 the middle and upper classes of England 英国中上层阶级 and what their morals were 道德观念，how they upheld them 维护道德，and then sometimes violated them 违背道德. +

But not only was art undergoing change 经历变革，so was the manner in which Europeans bought stuff 购物方式. And for this, I need to tell you about the consumer revolution 消费革命. As industrialization took root 扎根 during this period, the middle and upper classes 中上层阶级 had much more disposable income 可支配收入 than ever before. The result was increased demand for consumer goods 消费品 that were being manufactured all over Europe 全欧洲制造. People now began buying goods not necessarily because they needed them but because they wanted them 出于喜好而非需求. And these goods included porcelain dishes 瓷盘，mirrors 镜子，cotton and linens for home decor 家居装饰用的棉麻织物，and all kinds of things. +

Now you're gonna need to know the consequences 后果 of the consumer revolution as well. First was a new concern for privacy 隐私. Prior to 在…… 之前 the consumer revolution, homes were smaller and simpler, like with only a few rooms in the house. Each room had multiple purposes 多种用途. But now, people began to design homes with more rooms 更多房间，each of which had its own specific purpose 特定用途. And the increasing concern for privacy meant that people were building new kinds of rooms in their houses such as the boudoir 闺房. This was a room specifically designed for the wife of the house to be apart from her husband 与丈夫分开，either alone or entertaining other women 独处或招待女性友人. +

Another consequence of the consumer revolution was the increasing demand for new venues for leisure 休闲场所. Perhaps chief among them 其中最重要的，coffee houses 咖啡馆. Thanks to the Columbian Exchange 哥伦布大交换，coffee was growing in popularity among Europeans 受到欧洲人欢迎，and they built coffee houses in order to drink that magnificent beverage 饮品. In contrast to 与…… 不同 taverns 酒馆 where you got drunk and sang loud songs 醉酒高歌，coffee houses were open to men of all classes 各阶层男性，and the emphasis was on discussing the revolutionary ideas of the day 讨论当日的革命性思想. +

'''

== 中文释义

你在为理解美国大学预修课程欧洲历史第四单元的所有内容而苦恼吗？宝贝，你知道我会帮你的。嗯，我是史蒂夫·海姆勒，我来帮助你在课堂上得A，并在五月份的考试中得5分。所以，如果你准备好充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

所以这个单元在很大程度上是关于欧洲的有识之士，以及他们的思想是如何改变欧洲大陆的社会、政治和经济格局的。所以我认为我们应该从科学方面的进步开始讲起，也就是科学革命。在这个时期有三大类变化，它们都源于对文艺复兴时期人文主义的新重视：天文学、医学和推理。  +

关于天文学，也就是对物质宇宙的研究，让我先告诉你当时关于宇宙的主流观点是什么，然后我会告诉你它是如何改变的。像亚里士多德和托勒密这样的古希腊人发展出了一种以地球为中心的宇宙模型，这个模型把地球置于万物的中心。银河系中的其他天体都围绕地球运转，包括太阳。这是整个中世纪欧洲对天体的普遍认知。需要知道的是，这也是天主教会的观点。  +

但在我们所讨论的这个时期，有三个人出现了，他们用大量的实证狠狠地冲击了这种主流观点。第一个人是尼古拉·哥白尼（Nicolas Copernicus）。通过复杂的数学计算，哥白尼挑战了以地球为中心的宇宙观，他提出了日心说，认为太阳是宇宙的中心，地球和天空中其他所有天体都围绕太阳运转。此外，他还证明了太阳看起来会升起和落下的原因是地球本身在绕轴自转。听着，他必须用复杂的数学来证明这一点，因为用肉眼看根本不是这样的。  +

然后是约翰内斯·开普勒（Johannes Kepler）。他在哥白尼模型的基础上又做了复杂的数学运算，并且他完成了两件事。首先，开普勒肯定了哥白尼的观点，即太阳是银河系的中心。其次，他发现行星绕太阳的轨道不是完美的圆形，而是椭圆形。  +

第三，你需要了解伽利略·伽利雷（Galileo Galilei）。你看，哥白尼和开普勒主要是通过思考得出他们的结论，但伽利略更进一步，他不再仅仅依靠思考，而是运用他的眼睛进行观察。他制造了一种叫做望远镜的装置，这使得人类的眼睛能够看到太空中更远的地方。虽然望远镜不是他发明的，但他为自己制造了一台。有了望远镜，伽利略能够详细地观察不同行星的卫星，并且他能够证明其他行星并不像以前认为的那样是发光的天体，而是和地球由相同的物质构成。  +

当这些人进行他们的研究时，他们颠覆了以前关于宇宙如何运行的假设。想必你不会惊讶于天主教会对此很不满意。许多这样的发展都发生在天主教改革时期，如果你还记得我们在第二单元谈到的内容，你会记得这场改革运动的产物之一是一份禁书名单。嗯，哥白尼和开普勒的书最终都出现在了这些名单上。为什么会这样呢？嗯，因为根据他们对《圣经》的解读，亚里士多德的宇宙观与《圣经》中关于宇宙的描述相符。《创世纪》第一章说地球有其根基，天空中有一个苍穹将尘世与天国分开，也就是说，按照教会的说法，《圣经》把地球置于被创造秩序的中心。所以哥白尼、开普勒和伽利略的这些新思想不仅挑战了像亚里士多德和托勒密这样经过充分验证的古人——他们还暗示《圣经》在宇宙的秩序方面是错误的。如果欧洲历史教会了我们什么，那就是如果你开始告诉教会它有地方出错了，你就会有麻烦。  +

不管怎样，教会把开普勒和哥白尼的书列入了禁书名单。尽管伽利略本人是一个虔诚的天主教徒，教皇还是指控他犯有异端罪，伽利略被迫在软禁中度过了余生。但他的作品在他死后得以出版，事实证明，他是正确的。  +

好的，这就是天文学领域发生的事情。现在让我们转移话题，谈谈医学和解剖学方面的进步。这里也发生了同样的事情。古希腊人对人体和医学的理解被那些善于思考的人推翻了。那么在这些领域的主流观点是什么呢？为此，让我给你介绍一下盖伦（Galen）。他是一位古希腊人，他在解剖学和生理学方面的著作在整个中世纪欧洲都被广泛接受。盖伦提出了他所谓的人体体液理论。基本上，他认为人体由四种物质或体液组成，即血液、黄胆汁、黑胆汁和痰。如果你仔细听，这意味着根据盖伦的理论，你身体大约25%是由痰组成的。不管怎样，根据盖伦的理论，当这四种体液处于平衡状态时，身体是健康的，但当它们失衡时，疾病就会产生。  +

但就像在宇宙学领域一样，这个时期有新的思想家出现，挑战了盖伦的理论，他们基于观察和实验发展出了一种新的理解。首先你应该知道的名字是帕拉塞尔苏斯（Paracelsus），他拒绝接受疾病的体液理论，声称疾病是由化学失衡引起的。如果这是真的，那么化学药物可以解决这些失衡问题。例如，如果一个人皮肤干燥、有鳞屑并且总是感到疲惫，这不是体液失衡的迹象，而是身体化学失衡——在这种情况下，是缺铁。盖伦可能会看到这些症状，然后放血以使体液恢复平衡，但帕拉塞尔苏斯认为应该给这个人补充铁。这对我们来说很明显，但在当时这是革命性的。  +

你应该知道的第二个名字是威廉·哈维（William Harvey），他进一步推翻了盖伦关于血液循环的观点。盖伦认为人体内有两种不同的血液系统，它们彼此不相互作用。而哈维通过实验发现，循环系统是一个完整的整体。血液从心脏被泵出，流经身体，然后再回到心脏，循环往复。  +

最后，这个时期还发展出了新的推理方法，同样，这是基于数学和实证实验。弗朗西斯·培根（Francis Bacon）认为知识来自实证研究，他是归纳推理的先驱。这意味着，培根认为，如果你想了解任何事物，你要从观察事物的最小部分开始，然后从那里推导出一般原则。勒内·笛卡尔（René Descartes）以倡导演绎推理而闻名。笛卡尔从尽可能大的原则开始——比如那些不容置疑的事情，例如，一切都是由物质构成的——从这些大的理念出发，然后你可以逐步得出关于具体事物的知识。不管怎样，这两个人都是挑战古希腊哲学主导地位、为理解世界的新方法（也就是科学方法，强调通过观察和实验来理解物质世界）奠定基础的主要人物。  +

尽管在人类理解世界以及世界之外的方式上有了这些重大创新，旧有的信仰仍然存在。例如，我刚才提到的大多数创新者仍然相信上帝，并且认为世界受到精神力量的统治和影响。很大一部分让我们对宇宙的认知发生巨大变化的人，实际上仍然相信占星术，占星术是研究天体的位置如何影响人类事件的学问。此外，他们还继续追求炼金术，炼金术是一种伪科学，试图将某些金属变成黄金。所以你要记住，科学的世界观并没有一下子就取代那种更具魔幻色彩的世界观。  +

好的，启蒙运动是一场建立在科学革命期间发生的激进思想转变基础上的运动。启蒙思想家将这些新的推理方法应用于政治、社会和人类制度。这样做的结果是，他们同样推翻了许多被视为绝对真理的思想。启蒙运动始于法国，这并不令人惊讶。法国是专制政府最为强大的国家，人民厌倦了法国君主强加给他们的控制。所以启蒙运动中的许多新思想都是对这种专制主义的反抗。  +

所以关于社会和人类制度，让我给你介绍两位法国哲学家。首先，也是可能最重要的一位，是伏尔泰（Voltaire）。这不是他的真名，但就像麦当娜（Madonna）和碧昂丝（Beyoncé）一样，他厉害到只用一个名字就广为人知。伏尔泰无疑是法国哲学家中最著名、最具代表性的人物。他创作了大量不同体裁的作品，这些作品有一个共同点：对法国的社会和宗教制度进行批判。他最尖锐的批评之一是关于他所观察到的法国的宗教不宽容现象。他在英国待过一段时间，他看到因为英国允许许多不同版本的宗教存在，这些宗教能够和平共处。相比之下，在法国，天主教被强制施加于民众，伏尔泰认为这是一种压迫。他确实相信自然权利，并主张在教育和言论自由方面进行改革，但他不认为人民有能力管理自己，因为，说实话，大多数人都是自私、无知的家伙，因此他们需要一个强大、开明的君主来统治他们。  +

好的，你需要了解的第二位法国哲学家是德尼·狄德罗（Denis Diderot）。不是丹尼斯（Dennis）——就是那个在地铁站卖传呼机的人——是德尼（Denis）。不管怎样，狄德罗试图根据启蒙运动的原则对整个知识体系进行分类编目。为此，他编辑并出版了极具影响力的《百科全书》，从它的副标题你就能了解到关于这部作品的关键信息：《科学、艺术和工艺的理性词典》。首先，强调理性。其次，强调科学、艺术和工艺。换句话说，对一切事物进行理性的解释。狄德罗召集了主要的思想家为《百科全书》撰写了超过72000个条目，其结果是具有革命性的。科学和理性的认知方式受到推崇，而宗教则遭到轻视。作者们批评了旧的社会制度和宗教不宽容现象，总的来说，这一套书总结了启蒙运动的整个世界观。也许不用说，法国政府不太喜欢这样的作品，因为这些思想家似乎想要剥夺他们的权力。  +

现在，启蒙思想家们还对关于上帝的新思考方式负有责任。伏尔泰发展出了自然神论，他认为存在一个上帝，但上帝不干预人类事务。相反，上帝就像一个宇宙钟表匠，把所有的部件放在合适的位置，上紧发条，然后就让它滴答运转。这当然意味着《圣经》中的奇迹故事被视为未开化过去的遗迹而被摒弃。自然神论者认为上帝通过不变的物理定律统治世界，而不是通过施行违背这些定律的奇迹。狄德罗也是一个自然神论者，因此他不认同有组织的宗教。记住，伏尔泰和狄德罗都生活在法国，而法国是一个天主教国家。由于宗教和政治在那里紧密相连，说任何反对宗教的话也会对国家提出质疑。所以，情况变得紧张起来。  +

此外，狄德罗在他的《百科全书》中把无神论定义为知道上帝的存在却有意识地拒绝承认上帝存在的人。如果一个人是无神论者，这意味着没有上帝，并且所有可知的事物不是通过启示，而是通过人类感官与物质世界的相互作用来理解。我还应该提到在这方面的另一个人，即苏格兰思想家大卫·休谟（David Hume）。他发展出了怀疑主义哲学，认为我们大脑中的思想仅仅反映了我们的感官输入。因此，理性无法说服我们相信任何超出我们感官所能解释的事情。换句话说，一个人唯一能确定的事情是他通过感官所体验到的东西。这样，怀疑主义使一个人对一切事物提出质疑，包括对教会教义的质疑。  +

我希望你能开始看到这里的一个主题。启蒙运动期间发生的很多事情不仅削弱了政治权威的绝对权力，也削弱了宗教的绝对权威。这些关于宗教的新思想最显著的结果之一是：宗教越来越被视为个人而非公共事务。需要明确的是，这是那些不是国王的人开始持有的观点。从前面几个单元的内容中应该很清楚，专制君主非常认为宗教是公共事务。但在普通民众中，随着社会结构越来越世俗化，这种情况开始发生转变。宗教的重点从公共归属转向个人归属。例如，如果在启蒙运动之前有人问你是否是基督徒，而你生活在一个基督教国家，答案会是肯定的——比如，我是英国公民，所以我是基督徒。但新的复兴运动开始强调个人的皈依，而不是国家归属，将其作为真正信仰的试金石。  +

一个很好的例子是17和18世纪由尼古拉斯·冯·辛岑多夫伯爵（Count Nicolas von Zinzendorf）领导的德国虔敬主义宗教复兴运动。虔敬主义教导说，真正的宗教体验不仅仅是属于某个教会，而是与一种神秘的个人宗教体验紧密相连。当然，在德国的大部分地区，路德教是被接受的宗教，但辛岑多夫强烈反对他们所宣扬的对基督的理性主义态度。事实上，他曾经说过：“试图用头脑理解上帝的人会成为无神论者。”所以，你懂的，他有点走极端。  +

好的，所以人们不仅在构思关于上帝的新思维方式，其他人也将这种理性假设应用于政治。为此，让我给你介绍约翰·洛克（John Locke）。为了理解约翰·洛克的思想，你需要理解自然权利的概念。这个概念认为，人类仅仅因为是人，就拥有生命、自由和财产等权利。根据洛克的说法，这些权利是由创造者，也就是上帝赋予的。这是一件大事，因为如果人类的权利是由上帝赋予的，这意味着这些权利不是来自君主或政府。这进一步意味着君主或政府不能剥夺这些权利。再进一步说，这意味着国家的权力实际上源于人民，这就是所谓的人民主权思想。所以如果这是真的，那么人民只能在自己同意的情况下被统治，而不是基于君权神授。不是吗？哦，是的。  +

还记得上一单元我们谈到英国内战和光荣革命吗？威廉和玛丽（William and Mary）登上英国王位的条件是他们签署《权利法案》（English Bill of Rights）。在我看来，这充满了约翰·洛克思想的味道。  +

然后是让 - 雅克·卢梭（Jean-Jacques Rousseau）。公平地说，卢梭有几个相互关联的思想，但我只告诉你他最著名的思想。你需要将卢梭与社会契约的思想联系起来。如果人们真的拥有自然权利，那么当他们建立政府来保护这些权利时，他们就与政府签订了社会契约。这个契约有两个方面。人民自愿交出一些权力来建立政府，他们这样做是为了让政府保护他们的自然权利。这里的假设是政府会按照人民的意愿行事，卢梭把这称为“公意”。如果政府做不到这一点，那么人民有权解除契约并建立一个新政府。如果你是美国人，这听起来很熟悉，因为这些思想被写进了我们的《独立宣言》。  +

只是为了开个玩笑，你应该知道卢梭认为男人和女人在根本上是不同类型的人，因此应该对他们应用严格的性别角色。女人应该服从男人，因为，毕竟，如果不是女人，谁来给男人做三明治呢？这是他的话，不是我说的。而且，有孩子的女人应该留在家里抚养孩子。  +

玛丽·沃斯通克拉夫特（Mary Wollstonecraft）是一位英国作家和哲学家，毫不奇怪，她强烈反对这些严格的性别分类。为了反对卢梭，她写了《女权辩护》（The Vindication of the Rights of Women），在书中她认为女人实际上在本质上并不比男人低等，女人在某些方面看起来低等，只是因为她们因性别而被剥夺了教育和机会。  +

然后是亚当·斯密（Adam Smith），他将启蒙思想应用于经济学。在他的《国富论》（The Wealth of Nations）一书中，斯密抨击了许多欧洲国家的重商主义政策。他认为政府应该把手从经济中拿开，让人们根据供求规律做出经济决策。通过这种方式，自由市场的“看不见的手”将增加国家的繁荣，并摒弃重商主义经济政策。再说一次，这不仅仅是思考层面的事情。批评重商主义就是批评专制君主所选择的经济制度。  +

好的，现在我已经给你简要介绍了启蒙运动中的一些主要思想，但让我们花点时间思考一下这些思想是如何传播的。它们传播的第一种方式——等等，你应该知道——在过去的几个单元里，任何思想是如何在欧洲传播的呢？嗯，印刷机。没错。就像我之前说的，印刷机有助于传播启蒙思想。但也有一些新的机构专门为讨论和传播启蒙思想而建立。其中最重要的是沙龙（salon）。不，不是那个沙龙（美发沙龙）。我说的是思想交流的沙龙。基本上，沙龙是在豪华住宅中举行的私人聚会，知识分子们在那里公开讨论和辩论当时的新思想。许多最著名的沙龙是由女性主持的。例如，德芳侯爵夫人（Madame du Deffand）在她家里每周举办一次沙龙。  +

但等一下。你不仅要知道这些思想是如何传播的，还需要理解这些思想传播的重要性。这些思想传播得越多，人们就越对当时的主流政治制度感到不满。而这种不满将在下一单元以美国、法国和海地革命的形式产生后果。你不会认为启蒙运动对权力结构没有影响吧，是吧？你可真天真。  +

记住，我们之前讨论的政治权力的最后一个发展是专制主义，在这种制度下，君主试图尽可能地巩固自己的权力。在某些情况下，这导致了宗教不宽容，比如路易十四统治下的法国。在其他情况下，这导致了无休止的领土扩张，同样是路易十四统治下的法国。但启蒙思想的传播影响了专制主义运动。一些君主试图成为开明的专制君主，你应该知道其中一些人的名字。但在我介绍他们之前，让我先明确关于他们头衔中“开明”部分的两件事。首先，他们在对自己有利的时候才以开明的方式行事。其次，他们实施的改革非常短视。总的来说，他们只考虑这些改革的直接影响，这些影响应该有助于他们维持权力，而没有考虑到长期影响，而长期影响会让人民想要更多的权利，从长远来看，这最终会削弱君主的权力。好的，提醒完了。现在让我给你介绍这些人。  +

首先是普鲁士的腓特烈二世（Frederick II of Prussia），也就是腓特烈大帝（Frederick the Great）。回想一下，《威斯特伐利亚和约》承认了神圣罗马帝国各邦国的主权，这削弱了帝国的力量。不再是一个皇帝统治一切，而是有300个君主争夺权力。在这种背景下，普鲁士在腓特烈的领导下崛起，他使普鲁士成为全欧洲主要的军事力量之一。那么是什么让腓特烈变得开明呢？嗯，他关心如何更好地为他的人民服务，并且他认为自己不是人民的独裁者，而是他们的恩人。你肯定能看到启蒙思想在其中的影响。此外，腓特烈赞助哲学家，按照伏尔泰的说法，腓特烈被视为哲学家国王。他还增加了新闻出版的言论自由，并且他改革了司法系统，消除了法律下的阶级差异。但记住，他做这些并不是出于他自己的好心。这些改革中的许多措施都削弱了普鲁士的贵族势力，这有助于在腓特烈的领导下巩固权力。  +

好的，另一位你应该知道的开明专制君主是俄罗斯的叶卡捷琳娜二世（Catherine II of Russia），更广为人知的是叶卡捷琳娜大帝（Catherine the Great）。她开明在哪里呢？嗯，她改革了刑法系统，废除了酷刑和死刑，改革了教育，并且赞助艺术。公平地说，在她统治后期她变得更加保守，但总的来说，她属于开明专制君主这一类。但同样，她做这些的原因是为了维护她的权力。叶卡捷琳娜和普鲁士的腓特烈一样，实施了许多削弱贵族势力的改革。那么权力会流向哪里呢？流向叶卡捷琳娜。  +

不管是否开明，到1800年，西欧和中欧的大多数政府都增加了对基督教少数派和犹太人的宗教宽容。约翰·洛克坚持的政教分离对此有很大影响。如果国家不再控制教会，那么臣民持有不同信仰对君主的权力不再构成威胁。例如，1789年撰写的《人权宣言》（Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen）宣布所有法国公民享有宗教自由。俄罗斯的叶卡捷琳娜大帝承认犹太人是俄罗斯的臣民，并在1782年的《城镇宪章》（Charter of Towns）下给予他们更多的公民自由。虽然在叶卡捷琳娜的统治下，犹太人基本上仍然是二等公民，但无论如何，他们在这个时期还是取得了一些进步。  +

好的，现在我们已经谈了很多这个时期社会上层发生的事情，但现在是时候看看普通社会中发生了什么。在这个时期，我们将见证前工业化欧洲向后工业化欧洲的快速转变。我们需要谈论的第一个重大转变是关于食物和人口。在这个时期，人口急剧增加，这有两个原因。出生率在缓慢上升，但由于医学的进步，死亡率同时在下降。不仅更多的婴儿在童年时期存活下来，而且人们更健康、更强壮，因此寿命更长。再加上黑死病，它在14世纪导致大量人口死亡，后来消失了，但又反复出现，突然就消失了。历史学家对其消失的原因存在争议，但关键是没有了黑死病，更多的人活到了老年。此外，天花是另一种致命疾病，它经常导致大量人口死亡，但多亏了爱德华·詹纳（Edward Jenner）发明的新的天花疫苗，这种疾病的威胁大大降低，因此死于天花的人减少了。  +

所以婴儿在婴儿期存活下来，人们寿命更长，嘿，这听起来是件好事，对吧？嗯，如果托马斯·马尔萨斯（Thomas Malthus）的观点成立的话，就不是这样了。他观察到，虽然人口增长率在上升，但食物供应无法跟上。这意味着，除非人口得到控制，或者有办法增加食物供应，否则结果将是大量人口死于饥饿。所以，你知道，他不是那种你想邀请参加孩子成年礼的人。“你知道，我真的很高兴戴夫今天成年了，但从长远来看，这并不重要，因为每个人都会死于饥饿。”  +

不管怎样，事实证明，欧洲人通过一系列被称为农业革命的事件解决了食物问题。在这个时期，更多的土地被用于耕种。例如，在英国和荷兰等地，他们修建堤坝，排干湿地以种植更多的粮食。此外，轮作技术的进步带来了更丰富的作物产量。农民们发现，种植豆类和三叶草等作物可以补充土壤肥力，而不是让一部分土地休耕，这意味着所有土地都能产出作物，而不仅仅是一部分土地。此外，农业技术的进步也推动了这场革命。欧洲人开始对牲畜进行选择性繁殖，将最好的牲畜品种结合起来，以培育出质量更好的牲畜。还有杰思罗·塔尔（Jethro Tull）发明的条播机，它能精确地将种子播种在土壤深处，这样风就不会把种子吹走，从而提高了作物产量。许多国家还建立了更好的交通系统。运河被连接和扩展，道路得到改善，桥梁得到加固。所有这些使得将食物运送给不断增长的人口变得更便宜、更高效。  +

然而，在谈论人口爆炸时，我至少应该提到一个阻碍人口增长的模式，那就是欧洲的婚姻模式。随着对核心家庭（与大家庭不同的独立实体）的新重视，人们结婚越来越晚。这是因为为了建立一个新的家庭单位，你必须有足够的财富和资源，而这需要时间。所以人们开始晚婚，女性生育的孩子也越来越少。即便如此，你也应该知道，在这个时期，非婚生子的比例急剧上升。这些被称为私生子，这表明人们在婚姻之外的亲密关系比以前多得多。但别担心，未婚妈妈在社会上仍然面临着巨大的耻辱，许多未婚妈妈因此不得不沦为妓女。  +

说到家庭和孩子，随着婴儿和儿童死亡率的降低，家庭有了更多的可支配收入，他们开始为孩子投入更多的空间和时间。孩子们——事实上，那些善于思考的人也开始对童年发表高见。让 - 雅克·卢梭认为孩子是一种独特的存在，他们的童年应该得到细心父母的重视，因此在他们进入成人的工作世界之前应该玩耍。这在人们对孩子的看法上是一个巨大的转变。比如，在这个时期之前，孩子仅仅被视为小大人。所以他们像大人一样工作，并且受到严厉的管教。但在这个时期，对童年的观念发生了变化。例如，拿破仑（我们将在第五单元详细介绍他）在1802年在法国建立了一个学校系统，该系统使用统一的课程，旨在把孩子们培养成更全面的公民。  +

好的，这就是关于食物和家庭方面发生的事情，但我们还需要谈谈这个时期另一个重要的社会变化，即大量人口从农村地区向城市迁移。很大程度上是因为像钢犁和条播机这样的技术进步，农场需要的工人减少了。因此，为了找到工作，许多农村人搬到了城市，这个过程被称为城市化。但随着这种大规模迁移的发生，城市被涌入的人群压得不堪重负，这引发了一些问题。首先，没有足够的住房供这些人居住。为了解决这个问题，一种新型住房——公寓（tenement）出现了。这些是仓促建造的公寓楼，工人可以以相当低的价格租用房间。然而，这些公寓通风不好，并且没有室内管道设施。通风不良意味着像肺结核这样的空气传播疾病可以迅速传播。没有室内管道设施意味着人们不得不把垃圾扔出窗外，扔到街道上。所以不用说，用专业的历史术语来说，城市变得“臭气熏天”。随着大量贫困工人涌入城市，其他城市居民面临着贫困带来的问题，比如犯罪和卖淫。  +

为了解决这些问题，当局通过了一些旨在根除这些问题的法律。一个很好的例子是英国1864年的《传染病法》（Contagious Disease Act）。这项法律旨在打击卖淫行为。比如，如果一个女人被怀疑从事淫乱活动，她会被逮捕，并接受强制身体检查，以确定她是否患有性病。如果是，她会被送进一所高度戒备的医院，像对待囚犯一样对待她。  +

好的，在最后一部分，让我们看看在这个时期欧洲的文化和知识生活是如何保持和变化的。首先，让我谈谈阅读革命。由于印刷机的影响力不断增加，人们的阅读速度远远超过了以往任何时候。不仅书籍的数量增加了，而且书籍的种类也开始广泛变化。例如，在法国，宗教虔诚书籍的数量开始减少，而关于历史、法律、科学和艺术的书籍数量迅速增加。所以随着所有这些新思想的传播，审查制度也加强了，以遏制这些思想。而且主要的审查者是宗教方面的。例如，天主教会制裁了狄德罗的《百科全书》，因为它大胆地质疑宗教权威。但即使有审查制度的尝试，阅读革命还是占据了主导，人们的阅读量比以往任何时候都多。  +

人们阅读的不仅仅是书籍。报纸、期刊和小册子也大量涌现。启蒙思想家、自然科学家和探险家在这个时期环游世界，当他们回来时，他们写下了自己的观察结果。这产生了两个影响。首先，它让有文化的欧洲人接触到了其他文化。其次，这些描述中的一些内容挑战了欧洲人所接受的社会规范。例如，探险家们关于美洲土著社会的描述表明，这些社会不像欧洲社会那样等级森严。  +

在艺术方面，重点从歌颂宗教主题和国王的王权，转向了私人生活和公共利益。在大约1750年之前，巴洛克风格（Baroque style）的艺术促进了宗教情感，并且被君主用来展示国家权力。这是一种以其奢华、细节和炫耀性特征让人惊叹的风格。例如，吉安·洛伦佐·贝尼尼（Gian Lorenzo Bernini）雕刻了宏伟的广场，并为圣彼得大教堂（Saint Peter's Basilica）的翻新设计了华丽的小礼拜堂。约翰·塞巴斯蒂安·巴赫（Johann Sebastian Bach）创作的许多作品都是为了在皇家宫廷或高级教堂仪式上演奏。但在18世纪，艺术的性质和主题从国家和宗教主题转向了吸引资产阶级社会（也就是中产阶级）的主题。这种新的艺术风格被称为新古典主义（Neoclassicism）。与巴洛克风格的奢华和宏伟形成对比，新古典主义艺术家推崇简洁和对称。这在文学方面表现得尤为明显。比如丹尼尔·笛福（Daniel Defoe）写了《鲁滨逊漂流记》（Robinson Crusoe）。这是一个人在荒岛上学会生存和繁荣的故事，并且他在没有宗教权威或基督教教义指导的情况下做到了这一点。还有简·奥斯汀（Jane Austen），她写了《理智与情感》（Sense and Sensibility）和《傲慢与偏见》（Pride and Prejudice）。她的故事关注英国的中上层阶级，以及他们的道德观念，他们如何维护这些观念，以及有时如何违背这些观念。  +

但不仅仅是艺术在发生变化，欧洲人购物的方式也在改变。为此，我需要告诉你关于消费革命的事情。随着这个时期工业化的扎根，中上层阶级拥有了比以往更多的可支配收入。结果是对在欧洲各地生产的消费品的需求增加了。人们现在开始购买商品，不一定是因为他们需要这些商品，而是因为他们想要这些商品。这些商品包括瓷盘、镜子、用于家居装饰的棉布和亚麻布，以及各种各样的东西。  +

现在你也需要知道消费革命的后果。首先是对隐私的新关注。在消费革命之前，房子更小、更简单，比如家里只有几个房间。每个房间都有多种用途。但现在，人们开始设计有更多房间的房子，每个房间都有其特定的用途。对隐私日益增长的关注意味着人们在家里建造了新的房间，比如闺房（boudoir）。这是一个专门为家庭中的妻子设计的房间，让她可以与丈夫分开，要么独处，要么招待其他女性。  +

消费革命的另一个后果是对新的休闲场所的需求增加。其中最主要的就是咖啡馆（coffee houses）。由于哥伦布大交换（Columbian Exchange），咖啡在欧洲人中越来越受欢迎，他们建造咖啡馆来享用这种美妙的饮料。与酒馆（taverns）不同，在酒馆里人们会喝醉并大声唱歌，咖啡馆对各个阶层的男人开放，重点是讨论当时的革命性思想。  +

Are you struggling to understand everything you need to know for AP European History Unit Four? You know I got you, boo. Well, I'm Steve Heimler, and I'm here to help you get an A in your class and a five on your exam in May. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, then let's get to it.

So this unit is in large part all about Europe's thinking people and how their ideas changed the social, political, and economic landscape of the continent. So I reckon we ought to start with the advances in science, which is to say the Scientific Revolution. Now there are three big categories of change during this time, all of them emerging out of this new emphasis on Renaissance humanism: astronomy, medicine, and reasoning.

With respect to astronomy, which is the study of the physical universe, let me first tell you what the prevailing view of the universe was, and then I'll tell you how it changed. Ancient Greeks like Aristotle and Ptolemy developed a geocentric model of the universe which put the Earth at the center of everything. Every other body in the galaxy circled around the Earth, including the sun. And this was the assumed understanding of the celestial spheres throughout medieval Europe. And it's important to know that this was also the Catholic Church's view.

But during our period, three guys came along and took a massive empirical dump all over the prevailing view. The first was Nicolas Copernicus. Through complex mathematics, Copernicus challenged the geocentric view of the universe and instead put forth the heliocentric view which said that the sun was at the center, and the Earth, along with all the other heavenly bodies on display in the sky, revolved around the sun. Additionally, he was able to demonstrate that the reason it appears that the sun is rising and setting is because the Earth itself spins upon its axis. And look, he'd have to do that with complex mathematics because that is not at all how it looks to the naked eye.

Then came Johannes Kepler. He built upon Copernicus's model by again doing complex mathy stuff, and he accomplished two things. First, Kepler affirmed Copernicus's claim that the sun was at the center of our galaxy. Second, he found that planets orbited the sun not in perfect circles but rather in ellipses.

And third, you need to know Galileo Galilei. You see, both Copernicus and Kepler came to their conclusions mainly by mapping them out with their thinky thinky parts, but Galileo took those conclusions even further by taking them out of the brain and instead using his eyeballs. He built a contraption called a telescope which allowed the human eye to see far greater distances into space. Now he didn't invent the telescope, but he did build one for himself. And with the telescope, Galileo was able to observe in detail the moons of different planets, and he was able to prove that those other planets weren't celestial bodies of light as had previously been believed, but rather they were made out of the same stuff as Earth.

Now as each of these men did their work, they were overturning previous assumptions about how the cosmos worked. And presumably it won't surprise you to know that the Catholic Church was none too happy about this. Many of these developments were occurring during the Catholic Reformation, and if you'll remember when we talked about that back in Unit 2, you'll remember that one of the products of this reform movement was a list of banned books. Well, Copernicus and Kepler's books ended up on those lists. And why is that? Well, because according to their reading of the Bible, Aristotelian cosmology squared nicely with scriptural accounts of the cosmos. Genesis 1 says that the Earth is set upon foundations and that there is a firmament in the sky dividing the earthly realm from the heavenly realm, which is to say, by the church's reckoning, the Bible put the Earth at the center of the created order. So these new ideas from Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo challenged not only well-vetted ancients like Aristotle and Ptolemy -- they were suggesting that the Bible got it wrong with respect to the ordering of the cosmos. And if European history teaches us anything, it teaches us that if you start telling the church it's getting something wrong, you're about to get burned.

Anyway, the church put Kepler and Copernicus on their prohibited books list. Despite the fact that Galileo was a deeply committed Catholic himself, the Pope went ahead and charged him with heresy, and Galileo was forced to spend the rest of his days under house arrest. But his works were published after his death, and as it turned out, he was right.

Okay, that was what was happening in the world of astronomy. Now let's shift and talk about the advances that were happening in medicine and anatomy. And the same thing was happening here. Ancient Greek understandings of the human body and medicine were being overturned by the thinky thinky people. So what was the prevailing view in these fields? For that, let me introduce you to our boy Galen. He was an ancient Greek whose work in anatomy and physiology was widely accepted throughout medieval Europe. Galen advanced what he called the humoral theory of the body. Basically it said that the body was composed of four kinds of substances or humors, and those substances were blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm. If you're listening closely, that means according to Galen, about 25% of your body is made up of phlegm. Anyway, according to Galen, when these four humors were in balance, the body was healthy, but when they got out of balance, that was the cause for sickness and disease.

But just like in the cosmological realm, new thinkers came along in this period to challenge Galen's theory, and they developed a new understanding based on observation and experimentation. Now the first name you should know is Paracelsus, and he rejected the humoral theory of disease and claimed that it was chemical imbalance that caused disease. And if that was true, then chemical remedies could solve those imbalances. So for example, if a person has dry, flaky skin and is tired all the time, that's a sign not that the humors were out of balance, but instead that the body had a chemical imbalance -- in this case, an iron deficiency. Galen would have seen those symptoms and drain some blood out of the person to bring the humors back into balance, but Paracelsus argued that a person should be given more iron. Totally obvious to us, but it was revolutionary back then.

The second name you should know is William Harvey, who further overturned Galen's ideas, this time about the circulation of blood. Galen thought that there were two different systems of blood contained in the body and that they did not interact with one another. Harvey, on the other hand, through experimentation, discovered that the circulatory system was one integrated whole. Blood is pumped out of the heart through the body and returns to the heart to do the whole thing over again.

And finally, new methods of reasoning were being developed during this period, and again this was done based on mathematics and empirical experimentation. Francis Bacon argued that knowledge came by empirical research, and he was the pioneer of inductive reasoning. This meant that if you wanted to know about anything, Bacon argued, you started by observing the smallest parts of the thing and then moved to general principles from there. René Descartes was known for championing deductive reasoning. Descartes started with the largest possible principles -- like those things that cannot be doubted, for example, everything is made of matter -- from those big ideas, then you could work your way down to knowledge of the specifics. Either way, both of these men were among the first major players in challenging the dominance of ancient Greek philosophy and developing the basis for a new means of understanding the world, namely the scientific method, which emphasized observation and experimentation in order to understand the physical world.

Now despite these massive innovations in how humans understood the world and the world beyond them, older beliefs continued to persist. For example, most of the innovators that I just mentioned continued to believe in God and that the world was ruled and influenced by spiritual forces. A good portion of the folks blowing our minds about how the cosmos were actually situated continued to believe in practice in astrology, which is the study of how the position of heavenly bodies influenced human events. Furthermore, they continued the pursuit of alchemy, which was the kind of pseudoscience that attempted to turn certain metals into gold. So it's really important for you to remember that the scientific view of the world did not come in to replace the more magical view of the world all at once.

Okay, so the Enlightenment was a movement built upon the radical shift in thought that occurred during the Scientific Revolution. Enlightenment thinkers applied those new methods of reasoning to politics, society, and human institutions. And in doing so, they similarly overturned many of the ideas that were accepted as gospel truth. And it's no shock that the Enlightenment began in France. This was the state with the strongest absolutist government, and the people were sick of the control imposed upon them by the French monarchy. And so a lot of the new ideas in the Enlightenment started as reactions against that kind of absolutism.

So with respect to society and human institutions, let me introduce you to two of the French philosophers. First, and probably most important, was Voltaire. Now that wasn't his real name, but like Madonna and Beyoncé, he was bad enough to go by one name. Voltaire was easily the most famous and representative of the French philosophers. He produced voluminous writings in many different genres that all had one thing in common: criticism of the social and religious institutions of France. One of his most biting criticisms concerned the religious intolerance that he observed in France. He spent some time in England, and he saw that because so many competing versions of religion were allowed, they were able to exist peacefully. By contrast, in France where Catholicism was forcibly imposed upon the population, Voltaire viewed it as oppression. Now he did believe in natural rights and argued for reforms in education and free speech, but he did not believe that people were capable of governing themselves because, let's be honest, the massive people are selfish, ignorant turds, and thus they needed a strong, enlightened monarch to rule them.

Okay, the second French philosopher you need to know is Denis Diderot. Not Dennis -- that's the guy who sells you beepers in the subway station -- Denis. Anyway, Diderot sought to catalog the whole body of knowledge according to Enlightenment principles. To this end, he edited and published the incredibly influential Encyclopedia, whose subtitle tells you everything you need to know about this work: The Rational Dictionary of the Sciences, the Arts, and the Crafts. First, emphasis on rational. Second, emphasis on the sciences, the arts, and the crafts. In other words, a rational explanation of everything. Diderot gathered leading thinkers to produce over 72,000 entries for the Encyclopedia, and the result was revolutionary. Science and rationalistic ways of knowing were exalted while religion was poo-poo'd. The writers criticized old social institutions and religious intolerance, and in general, this set of volumes summed up the whole worldview of the Enlightenment. And maybe it goes without saying, but the French government was not a big fan of such work because those thinkers seemed to want to take their power away.

Now Enlightenment thinkers were also responsible for new ways of thinking about God. Voltaire developed deism, which argued that there was a God but that God did not intervene in human affairs. Instead, God was like a cosmic clockmaker that put all the pieces in place, wound the thing up, and then just let it tick away. And this of course meant that the miracle stories of the Bible were cast out as relics of an unenlightened past. Deists argued that God ruled the world by unchanging laws of physics, not by performing miracles which defied those laws. Diderot was also a deist, and as such did not agree with organized religion. And remember, both Voltaire and Diderot are living in France, which is a Catholic state. And because religion and politics were so closely bound up there, to say anything against religion was to call into question the state as well. So you know, things got tense.

Additionally, Diderot defined atheism in his Encyclopedia as someone who knows about God and consciously rejects God's existence. If someone was an atheist, that meant that there was no God and that anything that could be known was understood not by revelation but through human senses interacting with the material world. I should also mention another guy under this heading, namely the Scottish thinker David Hume. He developed the philosophy of skepticism, which argued that the ideas in our brains only reflect our sensory inputs. Therefore, reason cannot convince us of anything beyond what our senses can interpret. Or to say it another way, the only thing a person can know for sure is what that person experiences through their senses. And that way, skepticism leads a person to question everything, including questioning the dogmas of the church.

I hope you can start to see a theme here. So much of what occurred during the Enlightenment chipped away not only at the absolute power of political authority but absolute religious authority as well. Now one of the most significant results of these new ideas about religion was this: religion was increasingly viewed as a matter of private rather than public concern. And to be clear, this was the view that people who were not kings began to hold. As should be clear from this in the previous units, absolutist monarchs very much thought that religion was a public concern. But on the ground level among the people, this began to shift as structures of society grew increasingly secular. The religious emphasis moved from public belonging to private belonging. Like if someone were to ask you if you were a Christian before the Enlightenment and you lived in a Christian state, the answer would be yes -- like, I'm a citizen of England and therefore I'm a Christian. But new revival movements began to emphasize personal conversion, not state belonging, as the litmus test for true belief.

A good example of this was the religious revival of German Pietism in the 17th and 18th century, led by Count Nicolas von Zinzendorf. Pietism taught that true religious experience was not just about belonging to a church but rather was bound up in a mystical, personal religious experience. Now in much of Germany, of course, Lutheranism was the accepted religion, but Zinzendorf reacted strongly against the rationalistic approach to Christ that they had preached. In fact, he once said, "He who wishes to comprehend God with his mind becomes an atheist." So you know, he was kind of a moderate.

Okay, so not only are people conceiving of new ways of thinking about God, but others are applying this kind of rational postulation towards politics as well. For this, let me introduce you to John Locke. In order to understand the thinking of John Locke, you need to understand the concept of natural rights. This is the idea that human beings, just by virtue of being human beings, possess rights like life, and liberty, and property. These, according to Locke, are given by the creator, which is to say God. And this was a big deal because if humans had been given rights by God, then that meant that those rights did not come from a monarch or a government. And that further means that a monarch or government could not take those rights away. And even further, that meant that the power of the state actually originated with the people, which is an idea called popular sovereignty. So if that's true, then the people can only be governed by their own consent and not the divine right of kings. No? Oh yes.

And remember back to the last unit when we talked about the English Civil War and the Glorious Revolution. William and Mary assumed the throne of England but only on the condition that they signed the English Bill of Rights. And that tastes like some John Locke sauce to me.

And then there was Jean-Jacques Rousseau. And to be fair, Rousseau had several overlapping ideas, but I'm only going to tell you the ideas for which they're most known. You need to associate Rousseau with the idea of the social contract. If people really did have natural rights, then when they establish a government in order to protect those rights, they are entering into a social contract with that government. And there are two sides to that contract. The people willingly surrender some of their power to create a government, and they do that so that the government will then protect their natural rights. And the assumption here is that the government will act in accordance with what the people want, and Rousseau's term for that was the general will. And if the government fails to do that, then the people have the right to dissolve the contract and install a new government. If you're an American and that sounds familiar, it's because those ideas are written into our Declaration of Independence.

And just for boobs and giggles, you should know that Rousseau argued that men and women were fundamentally different kinds of beings and thus rigid gender roles should be applied to each. Women should be subordinate to men because, after all, who is going to make the man a sandwich if not the woman? His words, not mine. And further, those women that have children should remain in the home to raise them.

Now Mary Wollstonecraft, who was an English writer and philosopher, not surprisingly vehemently opposed these rigid gender categories. In opposition to her, so she wrote The Vindication of the Rights of Women, in which she argued that women are not in fact inherently inferior to men, but in whatever way women seem to be inferior, it's only because education and opportunity have been denied to them on account of their sex.

And then it was our boy Adam Smith who applied Enlightenment thinking to economics. In his book The Wealth of Nations, Smith attacked the mercantilist policies of many European nations. He argued that governments ought to get their filthy hands out of the economy and instead let people make economic decisions based on the laws of supply and demand. In this way, the invisible hand of the free market would increase the prosperity of nations and abandon mercantilist economic policies. Again, this is not just thinking thinking stuff. To criticize mercantilism was to criticize the economic system of choice for absolutist monarchies.

Okay, so now I've given you a brief sketch of some of the major ideas coming out of the Enlightenment, but let's take a moment to consider how those ideas spread. And the first way they spread -- wait, you should know this -- in what way did any idea spread across Europe over the last few units? Uh, the printing press. That is correct. Me from the other camera, the printing press helps spread Enlightenment ideas. But there were also new institutions that were developed specifically to discuss and spread Enlightenment ideas. And the most significant of these was the salon. Nope, not that salon. That's a lot. Basically, salons were private meetings held in opulent houses where the intelligentsia openly discussed and debated these new ideas of the day. Many of the most well-known salons were hosted by women. For example, Madame du Deffand who held a weekly salon in her home.

But hold on just a second. You have to understand not just that the ideas spread, but you need to understand why it was important that these ideas were spreading. The more they spread, the more people began to grow dissatisfied with the prevailing political institutions. And that dissatisfaction is going to have consequences in the next unit in the form of the American, French, and Haitian revolutions. Now you didn't think the Enlightenment wasn't gonna have influence over power structures, did you? You're so crazy.

Now remember that the last development in political power we considered was absolutism, by which monarchs sought to consolidate as much power as possible under themselves. In some cases, this led to religious intolerance, as is the case of France under Louis XIV. And in other cases, it led to relentless territorial expansion, as is the case of France under Louis XIV. But the proliferation of Enlightenment thought influenced the absolutist movement. Some monarchs sought to become enlightened absolutists, and you should know a few names here. But before I introduce you to them, let me make clear two things about the enlightened portion of their title. First, they acted in enlightened ways when it benefited them. And second, they were very short-sighted in the reforms that they enacted. In general, they only looked to the immediate impact of those reforms which should help them stay in power and not to the long-term impact which would make the people want more rights, which ultimately would hurt the power of the monarchy in the long run. Okay, caveat done. Now let me introduce these folks to you.

First was Frederick II of Prussia, otherwise known as Frederick the Great. Recall that the Peace of Westphalia recognized the sovereignty of the individual states of the Holy Roman Empire, and that had the effect of weakening the empire. Instead of one emperor ruling over all, now there were 300 sovereigns vying for power. In this context, Prussia rose to power under the leadership of Frederick, who made Prussia one of the leading military forces in all of Europe. So what made Frederick all enlightened and whatnot? Well, he was concerned that he would serve his people well and considered himself not their dictator but rather their benefactor. And you can surely see the Enlightenment influence there. Additionally, Frederick patronized the philosophers, and by Voltaire's reckoning, Frederick was deemed a philosopher king. He also increased the freedom of speech in the press, and he reformed the judicial system to eliminate class differences under the law. But remember, it's not as if he's doing all this out of the goodness of his own heart. Many of these reforms are undermining the nobility in Prussia, and that helps consolidate power under Frederick.

Okay, another enlightened absolutist you should know is Catherine II of Russia, better known as Catherine the Great. And what was so enlightened about her? Well, she reformed the penal system to outlaw torture and capital punishment, reformed education, and patronized the arts. To be fair, she did grow more conservative later in her reign, but all in all, she falls into the category of enlightened absolutists. But again, the reason she was doing all this was to maintain her power. Catherine, like Frederick in Prussia, enacted an awful lot of reforms that undermined the nobility. And where is that power gonna go? Catherine.

Now, enlightened or not, by 1800 most governments in western and central Europe had increased their religious toleration to Christian minorities and Jews. A big influence on this was John Locke's insistence of the separation of church and state. If the state no longer controlled the church, then it was no longer a threat to a monarch's power for his or her subjects to hold different beliefs. For example, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, written in 1789, proclaimed religious freedom for all French citizens. Catherine the Great over in Russia recognized Jews as Russian subjects and extended more civil liberties to them under the Charter of Towns in 1782. Now Jews were still basically second-class citizens during Catherine's rule, but regardless, they did make some gains during this time.

Okay, now we've talked a lot about what was going on during this period in the upper echelons of society, but now it's time to look at what was going on down below in general society. Now during this period, we're going to witness a rapid transition between pre-industrial Europe and post-industrial Europe. Now the first of the major transitions we need to talk about is with respect to food and the population. There was a dramatic increase in population during this period due to two factors. Birth rates were slowly increasing, but thanks to advances in medicine, death rates were simultaneously decreasing. Not only were way more infants surviving childhood, but people were healthier and stronger and therefore living longer lives. Add to that the bubonic plague, which killed massive amounts of people in the 14th century and then went away and then came back over and over again, just suddenly died out. Historians dispute why that happened, but the point is without the Black Death, more people were living into older age. Additionally, smallpox was another deadly disease that frequently killed large portions of the population, but thanks to Edward Jenner's new vaccine against smallpox, much of the sting was taken out of this disease, and thus it killed less people.

So babies are surviving infancy, people are living longer, and hey, that sounds like a good thing, right? Well, not if you're Thomas Malthus. He observed that while the population rate was increasing, the food supply was not going to keep up with it. And that meant that unless either the population was cut off or there was some way to increase the food supply, then the result would be massive amounts of death by starvation. So you know, not the kind of guy you want to invite to your kids' bar mitzvah. "You know, I'm really glad that Dave is becoming a man today, but in the long run it doesn't really matter because everybody's gonna die of starvation."

Anyway, as it turns out, Europeans did solve the food problem in a series of events that became known as the Agricultural Revolution. During this period, more land became available for farming. For example, in places like England and the Netherlands, they built dikes and drained wetlands in order to plant more food. And also, advances in crop rotation yielded more abundant crops. Instead of letting a portion of land lie fallow, farmers discovered that planting crops like beans and clover would replenish the soil, and that meant that all the land was productive, not just part of it. Additionally, there were advances in agricultural technology that contributed to this revolution. Europeans began selective breeding of livestock, combining the best specimens of animals in order to yield better quality livestock. Also, there was Jethro Tull's seed drill, which planted seeds with precision deep in the soil so that the wind couldn't blow them away, which had the effect of increasing crop yields. And better transportation systems were built in many states as well. Canals were linked and expanded, roads were improved, and bridges were reinforced. All of this made it cheaper and more efficient to transport food to the growing population.

However, in all this talk about population explosion, I should mention at least one pattern that hindered population growth, and that's the European marriage pattern. With a new emphasis on the nuclear family, which was a separate entity from the extended family, people were marrying later and later. And that's because in order to create a new family unit, you had to have enough wealth and resources to start their own independent family, and that took time. So people began marrying later, and women were having fewer babies. Even so, you should also know that during this period, the rate of babies born to unwed parents spiked dramatically. These were known as illegitimate births, and what this indicated is that people were having way more uh, intimate relations outside of marriage than was previously the case. But don't worry, there was still a significant social stigma against unwed mothers giving birth outside of marriage, and many of them had to turn to prostitution as a result.

Speaking of families and children, as infant and child mortality decreased and families had more disposable income, families began dedicating more space and time to children. And children -- in fact, the thinking thinking people were starting to pontificate on childhood as well. Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued that children were a separate kind of being and that their childhood should be elevated by attentive parents and therefore they should be playing before they got thrown into the adult world of work. And this was a massive shift in how people thought about children. Like, before this period, children were just seen as small-sized adults. So they worked like adults, and they were disciplined severely. But during this period, notions of childhood change. For example, Napoleon -- on whom much more in Unit 5 -- established a school system in France in 1802 which used a common curriculum to turn children into more well-rounded citizens.

Okay, so that's what was going on with food and families, but we also needed to talk about another significant social change during this period, namely the large-scale migration of people from rural areas to urban areas. Largely because of technological advances like the steel plow and the seed drill, fewer workers were required on farms. Therefore, in order to find work, many rural folks moved to the city, a process known as urbanization. But as this began to occur on a large scale, cities were crushed by the onslaught of people streaming in, and that created some problems. First, there wasn't enough housing for all these people. So to solve that problem, a new kind of housing was created called the tenement. These were hastily constructed apartment buildings which had rooms that workers could rent for a pretty low price. However, they were not well ventilated, and there was no indoor plumbing. The poor ventilation meant that airborne diseases like tuberculosis could spread rapidly. No indoor plumbing meant that people had to take their waste and throw it out the window onto the street. So needless to say, the cities were, to use the technical historical term, a stanky. And so with all these working poor crowding into the cities, other urban residents were faced with the problems of poverty like crime and prostitution.

In order to address these problems, authorities passed laws meant to eradicate them. A good example is England's Contagious Disease Act of 1864. This law was meant to crack down on prostitution. Like if a woman was suspected of such licentiousness, she would be arrested and subjected to forced bodily inspections to determine if she was carrying a venereal disease. If so, she was put in a high-security hospital and treated like a prisoner.

Okay, in the final section, let's consider how European cultural and intellectual life was maintained and changed throughout this period. First, let me tell you about the reading revolution. Due to the increasing influence of the printing press, people began reading at a rate that far exceeded anything that came before it. Not only did the amount of books increase, but the kinds of books began to vary widely as well. For example, in France, the number of religious devotional books began to decrease, and books on history, and law, and science, and the arts began to increase rapidly. So with all these new ideas floating around, censorship increased to keep them at bay. And mainly the censors were religious. For example, the Catholic Church sanctioned Diderot's Encyclopedia for its brazen questioning of religious authority. But even with the attempts at censorship, the reading revolution took hold, and people were reading more than ever.

It wasn't only books that people were reading. There was an explosion of newspapers and periodicals and pamphlets as well. Enlightenment thinkers, natural scientists, and explorers traveled the globe during this period, and as they returned, they wrote down their observations. And that had two effects. First, it exposed the literate European population to cultures outside their own. Second, some of these depictions challenged Europeans' accepted social norms. For example, explorers who wrote about the indigenous societies in the Americas showed that they were not as rigidly hierarchical as European societies.

In terms of art, the emphasis shifted on the celebration of religious themes and royal power of kings to the private life and the public good. Until about 1750, art in the Baroque style promoted religious feeling and was employed by monarchs to illustrate state power. It was a style that sought to awe people with its opulence and detail and ostentatious features. For example, Gian Lorenzo Bernini sculpted magnificent piazzas and designed ornate chapels for the renovation of Saint Peter's Basilica. Johann Sebastian Bach wrote many of his compositions to be performed in a royal court or high church services. But in the 18th century, the nature and subject matter of art shifted from the state and religious themes to themes that appealed to the bourgeois society, which is to say the middle class. This new style of art was called Neoclassicism. In contrast to the opulence and the grandeur of Baroque, Neoclassical artists prized simplicity and symmetry. This was especially emphasized in literature. You had Daniel Defoe who wrote Robinson Crusoe. It's the story of a man shipwrecked on an island who learns to survive and thrive and does all of this without any guidance from religious authority or Christian doctrine. You also had Jane Austen who wrote Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice. Her stories were concerned with the middle and upper classes of England and what their morals were, how they upheld them, and then sometimes violated them.

But not only was art undergoing change, so was the manner in which Europeans bought stuff. And for this, I need to tell you about the consumer revolution. As industrialization took root during this period, the middle and upper classes had much more disposable income than ever before. The result was increased demand for consumer goods that were being manufactured all over Europe. People now began buying goods not necessarily because they needed them but because they wanted them. And these goods included porcelain dishes, mirrors, cotton and linens for home decor, and all kinds of things.

Now you're gonna need to know the consequences of the consumer revolution as well. First was a new concern for privacy. Prior to the consumer revolution, homes were smaller and simpler, like with only a few rooms in the house. Each room had multiple purposes. But now, people began to design homes with more rooms, each of which had its own specific purpose. And the increasing concern for privacy meant that people were building new kinds of rooms in their houses such as the boudoir. This was a room specifically designed for the wife of the house to be apart from her husband, either alone or entertaining other women.

Another consequence of the consumer revolution was the increasing demand for new venues for leisure. Perhaps chief among them, coffee houses. Thanks to the Columbian Exchange, coffee was growing in popularity among Europeans, and they built coffee houses in order to drink that magnificent beverage. In contrast to taverns where you got drunk and sang loud songs, coffee houses were open to men of all classes, and the emphasis was on discussing the revolutionary ideas of the day.
