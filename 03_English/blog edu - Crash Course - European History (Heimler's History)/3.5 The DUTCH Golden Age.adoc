So as European states 欧洲国家 like France, Prussia 普鲁士, Russia, and Austria were sliding headlong into 一头扎进；急速陷入 absolutism 专制主义 during this period, there were two very significant exceptions 例外 to this trend 趋势, namely 即 the English and the Dutch. And since we already talked about England's constitutionalism 立宪主义 in previous unit 3 videos, I reckon 认为 we ought to give this one to the Dutch. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

So where did this contrarian 叛逆的；反对的 Dutch experiment 尝试 in anti-absolutism 反专制主义 come from? We should know that prior to 在……之前 1648, all this territory 领土 right here was ruled by the Spanish Habsburgs 西班牙哈布斯堡王朝, and the Dutch were not real happy about that arrangement 安排. And so in the mid-16th century, the 80 Years' War 八十年战争 began with a Dutch revolt 起义 against their Habsburg ruler 统治者. By the end, that war kind of got folded into 融入；并入 the 30 Years' War 三十年战争 which we considered in another video, and all of it was ended in the Peace of Westphalia 威斯特伐利亚和约 signed in 1648. As a result of that treaty 条约, the Dutch won their independence 独立 from the Spanish, and the Republic of the United Provinces of the Netherlands 荷兰联省共和国 was born. Don't get confused 混淆 -- Netherlands 荷兰（国家） is the place, the Dutch 荷兰人 are the people. +

Now clearly the Dutch had kind of a monarchy hangover 君主制遗留影响 after so long being trampled upon 欺压；蹂躏 by the Habsburgs, and so they rejected 拒绝 a monarchical form of government 君主制政府 in favor of 支持；选择 a constitutional government 立宪政府. But the Dutch flavor of constitutionalism 荷兰式立宪主义 was different from England. England favored 倾向于 a constitutional monarchy 君主立宪制 in which the monarch 君主 was limited by the rule of law 法治 by the power of the two houses of Parliament 议会两院权力. The Dutch, on the other hand 另一方面, made precisely 明确地 no provision for 没有规定 a monarch, and instead opted for 选择 a republican government 共和政府, which means that the power was in the hands of the people 权力掌握在人民手中, and the government did its work by means of 通过 the people's representatives 人民代表. +

Now within the Netherlands, there were provincial governments 省政府 and there was a federal government 联邦政府, which you might roughly 大致地 compare to 与……相比 our government here in the U.S. -- we have state governments 州政府 and we have a federal government. There are also a lot of dissimilarities 不同之处, but as a general comparison 大致比较 that might help you to remember. In the Netherlands, each province 省 had its own assembly 议会 called an estate 省议会, and the provincial estates 省议会 held most of the power 掌握大部分权力. Each of these states was ruled by an oligarchy 寡头政治, which is a form of government in which a few people rule 少数人统治, as opposed to 与……相反 a monarchy in which one person ruled. Now the oligarchy 寡头统治集团 was usually made up of 由……组成 wealthy businessmen 富商 and rural landowners 乡村地主, and they handled 处理 all the province's domestic policy 省内政策. Furthermore 此外, each estate appointed 任命 a stadholder 执政者 who performed ceremonial duties 履行礼仪职责 and was responsible for 负责 military defense 军事防御. +

The federal government, which had a lot less power than the estates 省议会, was known as the States General 联省议会, and it mostly handled 处理 foreign policy 外交政策 and war. And because it had so little power 权力很小, every major issue 重大问题 had to be referred back to 提交给 the provincial government 省政府, all of which had veto power 否决权.

== 中文释义

在这一时期，当法国、普鲁士、俄罗斯和奥地利等欧洲国家一头扎进专制主义时，有两个非常重要的例外情况，那就是英国和荷兰。由于我们在之前第三单元的视频中已经讨论过英国的立宪主义，我觉得我们应该来聊聊荷兰。所以，如果你准备好充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

那么，荷兰这种反对专制主义的独特尝试是从何而来的呢？我们应该知道，在1648年之前，这片领土一直由西班牙哈布斯堡王朝（Spanish Habsburgs）统治，荷兰人对这种统治安排很不满意。于是在16世纪中期，八十年战争（80 Years' War）爆发，荷兰人反抗哈布斯堡王朝的统治。最终，这场战争被卷入了三十年战争（30 Years' War，我们在另一个视频中讨论过），所有这些战争以1648年签署的《威斯特伐利亚和约》（Peace of Westphalia）而告终。由于该条约，荷兰从西班牙手中赢得了独立，荷兰联省共和国（Republic of the United Provinces of the Netherlands）诞生了。别搞混了——“Netherlands”是指这个国家，“Dutch”指的是荷兰人。  +

很明显，在长期受到哈布斯堡王朝的压迫后，荷兰人对君主制心存反感，所以他们摒弃了君主制政府，转而支持立宪政府。但荷兰的立宪主义与英国的有所不同。英国倾向于君主立宪制，在这种制度下，君主的权力受到议会两院权力的法治限制。另一方面，荷兰完全没有为君主制做任何规定，而是选择了共和制政府，这意味着权力掌握在人民手中，政府通过人民代表来运作。  +

在荷兰国内，有省级政府和联邦政府，这大致可以和美国的政府作比较——美国有州政府和联邦政府。当然，两者也有很多不同之处，但这样的大致比较可能有助于你记忆。在荷兰，每个省都有自己的议会，称为等级会议（estate），省级等级会议掌握着大部分权力。每个省都由寡头政治（oligarchy）统治，寡头政治是一种由少数人统治的政府形式，与由一个人统治的君主制形成对比。寡头政治通常由富有的商人和乡村地主组成，他们处理该省的所有国内政策。此外，每个等级会议都会任命一位执政（stadholder），执政负责履行礼仪职责并承担军事防御责任。  +

权力远不及等级会议的联邦政府被称为联省议会（States General），它主要处理外交政策和战争事务。由于权力有限，所有重大问题都必须提交给省级政府，而每个省级政府都拥有否决权。这种政府结构对荷兰人来说非常成功，这就是为什么这个时期被称为荷兰的黄金时代（Dutch Golden Age）。他们的成功在很大程度上得益于当时荷兰是欧洲最富有的国家这一事实。  +

荷兰在造船业上投入巨大，并且由于其在大西洋上的地理位置，他们能够利用不断发展的大西洋贸易带来的财富。更不用说他们在印度洋贸易中也占据了重要地位。所有这些加在一起意味着荷兰在当时拥有全欧洲乃至世界最高的生活水平。这意味着当欧洲其他人还在为食物而骚乱时，荷兰人却能坐在餐桌前尽情享用美食。  +
