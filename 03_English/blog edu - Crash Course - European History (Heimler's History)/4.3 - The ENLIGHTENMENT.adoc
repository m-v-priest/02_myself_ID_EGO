Oh my goodness, get ready to crack them brain folds wide open （口语化表达，准备好绞尽脑汁；深入思考）because in this video I'm going to tell you everything you need to know about the Enlightenment 启蒙运动 for AP European History. And there is a lot. +

So as folks like Galileo 伽利略 and Kepler 开普勒 were using new methods of thinking and observation 观察 to revolutionize 彻底改变 humanity's conception 观念 of the natural world, Enlightenment thinkers 启蒙思想家 started thinking, "You know, I wonder if we can apply those same methods of thinking to social and human institutions 社会和人类制度." And spoiler alert （习语，剧透警告）-- that's what they do. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked with a healthy dose of rationalism 理性主义, let's get to it. +

So let's start with the definition of the Enlightenment. And hey, if you don't want to write it all down, then I've got note guides 笔记指南 for this video and all my videos you can grab right here. So the Enlightenment was a European intellectual movement 思想运动 in the 18th century that applied new methods of rational thinking 理性思考 to social and human institutions. +

In general, there were three main emphases 重点 of this movement that you need to know. First, the methods of science pioneered 开创 by Kepler and Newton 牛顿 and Galileo and others could be used to improve society. The name for this was rationalism, and it meant that everything in human life could and should be submitted to （习语，经受；接受）the process of reason 推理过程. +

Second, Enlightenment thinkers believed that as the scientific method 科学方法 could be used to discover the laws of nature 自然规律, it could also be used to discover the laws of society 社会规律. +

And third, if both of the first two were true, then Enlightenment thought 启蒙思想 could lead to progress in the human spirit 人类精神进步. So those are the big ideas of the Enlightenment. +

So now let's get down and dirty in the details （习语，深入细节）, and for that, let me introduce you to the major French philosophes 哲学家 -- and you know, that's just the French word for philosopher, don't get confused. And the reason Enlightenment thought first took root in （习语，扎根于）France is because France was kind of the biggest deal there was （习语，最重要的；最有影响力的）in the European continent during this time. +

All right, the first thinker to know is the Baron de Montesquieu 孟德斯鸠男爵. And as a member of France's noble class 贵族阶级, he was not a big fan of （习语，不喜欢）the growth of absolutism 专制主义 under Louis XIV 路易十四. To see the king consolidating 巩固 all the power under himself was to Montesquieu, and that objection animated 激发 the production of one of his greatest works, namely The Spirit of the Laws《论法的精神》. +

In this book, Montesquieu argued that separating power into multiple branches of government 政府权力分立 so that each branch can check the other 相互制衡 was the only way to avoid tyranny 暴政 and encourage equality 平等. +

The second thinker I want to introduce you to is the granddaddy of all French philosophes 法国哲学之父, namely Voltaire 伏尔泰. He was definitely the most famous of the philosophes and probably the most representative of their work 最具代表性的. He wrote something like 70 books in many different genres 体裁, but it all had one thing in common -- criticism of the social and religious institutions 社会和宗教制度 of France. +

Voltaire cringed hard at （习语，对……感到厌恶）the religious intolerance 宗教不宽容 that he observed in France. And he spent some time in England and saw that because so many competing versions of religion were allowed, they could exist peacefully 和平共处. In France, where Catholicism 天主教 was forcibly imposed upon 强制推行 the population, Voltaire viewed it as oppression 压迫. +

Even so, Voltaire was kind of a big fan of absolutism because he believed that ordinary people weren't really capable of governing themselves 管理自己. But he argued that absolutism must be tempered by （习语，被……缓和）Enlightenment thought. +

And third, let me introduce you to Denis Diderot 德尼·狄德罗. He was responsible for cataloging 编纂 the new Enlightenment worldview 世界观 in a work called The Encyclopedia《百科全书》. Now, Diderot didn't write this whole volume 卷 but rather collaborated with 与……合作 many other Enlightenment thinkers to produce over 72,000 articles on every conceivable realm 领域 of human life, filtered through the grid of Enlightenment thought 以启蒙思想为框架筛选. +

It's hard to underestimate the influence of this volume on the spread of the Enlightenment. It sold like madness （习语，畅销）. People began reading it, and it had a significant impact on how they thought about the world. +

Now, in addition to publishing books, the ideas of the Enlightenment spread through a variety of institutions 机构. For example, in France, one of the most popular was the salon 沙龙, which were private meetings 私人聚会 held in opulent houses 豪华住宅 where the intelligentsia 知识分子 openly discussed and debated new ideas of the day 当时的新思想. +

And then for the less well-off 不富裕的人, coffee houses provided a place where folks could gather and buy coffee for a penny 一便士 and discuss the new ideas of the day while drinking enough caffeine to kill a small horse （夸张表达，大量咖啡因）. +

Okay, now one of the major institutions of focus for Enlightenment thinkers was government and politics 政府与政治, and for that, let me introduce you to two other thinkers who contributed their big brains to this endeavor 努力 -- John Locke 约翰·洛克 and Jean-Jacques Rousseau 让 - 雅克·卢梭. +

Now, there are definitely nuanced differences 细微差别 between these two thinkers, but for our purposes, you just need to know the two main concepts on which Locke and Rousseau agree. +

The first political idea these men put forward 提出 was the idea of natural rights 自然权利. And these were rights that people had naturally -- honestly, it's a pretty good name for it. The idea here is that just by virtue of （习语，由于；因为）being a human born into the world, everyone had certain rights to which they were entitled 有权享有. +

For example, Locke wrote in his Second Treatise on Civil Government《政府论（下篇）》that people were born with rights to life 生命权, liberty 自由权, and property 财产权. And those rights were granted by the Creator 造物主. That last phrase is crucial to understand. If those rights are given by the Creator, then that means they are not given by a monarch 君主 and thus cannot be taken away or infringed upon 侵犯 by a monarch. +

And in the environment of absolutism that had gripped Europe 席卷欧洲 during that time, that was some spicy sauce （习语，很有冲击力；很刺激）. +

The second political idea these men put forth 提出 was the idea of the social contract 社会契约论. Rousseau wrote a book called The Social Contract《社会契约论》in which he argued that at the bottom of things （习语，根本上）, the power to govern 统治权 was in the hands of the people 人民手中. In order to protect their natural rights, the people choose to give some of that power over to 交给 a government. +

And then the contract piece of it means that if the government becomes a tyrannical turd （俚语，专制的废物）, then the people have the right -- nay （古语，甚至）, the responsibility -- to abolish that government and establish a new one that upholds their rights 维护他们的权利. +

The idea here is that people can only be governed by their own consent 同意 and that the root of governance 统治的根源 does not reside in （习语，不存在于）the divine right of kings 君权神授. That's also getting even spicier （习语，更有冲击力；更刺激）. +

Now, when I say that Rousseau argued that the power to govern is in the hands of the people, it's not quite accurate. More accurately, all the men have the power to govern. Rousseau believed that men and women were patently 明显地 not equal. He taught that women were by nature to remain subservient 顺从的 and to stay home raising children and making their husbands sandwiches. +

However, in the late 18th century, women like Mary Wollstonecraft 玛丽·沃斯通克拉夫特 objected powerfully to 强烈反对 this kind of gendered inequality 性别不平等. Her book A Vindication of the Rights of Women《女权辩护》argued that women by nature should have equal rights to men 与男性平等的权利 and, moreover 此外, that women should be entitled to 有权获得 the same education as men. +

Oh baby, let's keep that Enlightenment thinking train going （习语，继续启蒙思想的进程）and see how it applied to economics 经济学. And for this, I need to introduce you to Adam Smith 亚当·斯密 of the Scottish Enlightenment 苏格兰启蒙运动. +

In his book The Wealth of Nations《国富论》, Smith hacked 抨击 the mercantilist policies 重商主义政策 of European nations. And remember, mercantilism 重商主义 was a state-driven economic system 国家主导的经济体系. Smith argued instead that governments ought to get their filthy hands out of （习语，远离；不干预）the economy and instead let people make the economic decisions based on the laws of supply and demand 供求法则. +

He argued that decisions made in self-interest 自身利益 and not state interest 国家利益 would ultimately lead to a flourishing economy 繁荣的经济. And so Smith's work became the theoretical basis for concepts of the free market 自由市场 and free trade 自由贸易. +

Now, at the same time, French economic thinkers known as the physiocrats 重农学派 were arguing for similar economic principles 经济原则. For example, physiocrat and Robert -- Robert? Isn't it French? It's French, as it wrote Robert. I don't know. I can't imagine a French person saying Robert. We'll say Robert. +

And Robert Jacques Turgot 罗伯特·雅克·杜尔哥 advocated for 主张 laissez-faire economics 自由放任经济学 in France, which, when being translated, means "let alone" （法语，自由放任；不干涉）. He argued that the government should have a minimal role in economics 政府在经济中发挥最小作用 and instead let people decide what they wanted to buy and what kind of work they wanted to contribute to society 决定自己的消费和工作. +

Now, religious and metaphysical beliefs 宗教和形而上学信仰 were also challenged and changed by the Enlightenment. Voltaire popularized a belief called deism 自然神论. This is the idea that there was indeed a God but that God was uninvolved in human affairs 不干预人类事务. +

The God of deism was like a clockmaker 钟表匠 who put all the gears of the universe together 组装宇宙的齿轮 and then wound it up real tight 上紧发条 and then just let it tick away 让它自行运转 without any further interference 不再干预. Now, this of course was a serious challenge to Christianity 基督教, which emphasized the miraculous intervention of God in human history 上帝对人类历史的奇迹干预 -- not least in the centerpiece of the faith 信仰的核心, the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ 耶稣基督的身体复活. +

Another Scottish thinker named David Hume 大卫·休谟 developed the idea of skepticism 怀疑论. The idea here is that all human knowledge -- all our ideas -- are gained through our sense experience 感官经验. Like, we taste things, we touch things, we hear things, we see things, and then our brains cobble all that information together into knowledge about the world （习语，拼凑信息形成知识）. +

And if that's how we get knowledge, then our brains can only really reflect the world as it exists in material reality 物质现实. And that further means that since God or the creation of the universe cannot be mediated through our senses 无法通过感官感知, then they're not legitimate articles of knowledge 合法的知识. +

And finally, Diderot, through his Encyclopedia, popularized atheism 无神论, which is the belief that no God exists 上帝不存在. More to the point （习语，更确切地说）, an atheist 无神论者 is someone who knows about God and consciously rejects God's existence 有意识地拒绝上帝的存在. +

Now, with these very public attacks on religion 公开抨击宗教, religious belief more and more became a matter of private instead of public concern 私人而非公共事务. This way, religious revival movements 宗教复兴运动 emphasized personal piety 个人虔诚 and individual relationships to God 与上帝的个人关系. +

For example, the rise of German pietism 德国虔敬主义 in the 17th and 18th century, led by Count Nicolas von Zinzendorf 尼古拉斯·冯·青岑多夫伯爵, pietism taught that true religious experience was not just about belonging to a church 属于教会 but rather was bound up in （习语，与……紧密相连）the mystical 神秘的, personal religious experience 个人宗教体验. +

Now, in much of Germany, of course, Lutheranism 路德宗 was the accepted religion, but Zinzendorf reacted strongly against the rationalistic approach to Christ 对基督的理性主义态度 that they preached. +

And then, influenced by German pietism, an English Anglican preacher 英国圣公会传教士 named John Wesley 约翰·卫斯理 gave birth to （习语，创立；产生）the Methodist movement 卫理公会运动. After Wesley himself had a powerful personal experience with God, he set out preaching in the streets and in the fields 街头和田野布道 -- acts that were considered very improper by the Anglican establishment 英国圣公会认为不当的行为. +

But Wesley argued that true Christianity was a matter of the heart 内心的事, not any external fact 外在的事. Therefore, to truly know God, a person had to be seized by a great affection 被强烈的情感触动. +

== 中文释义

哦，天哪，准备好打开你的思维吧，因为在这个视频里，我要告诉你关于美国大学预修课程欧洲历史中启蒙运动你需要知道的一切。而且要讲的内容很多。  +

所以，*当像伽利略（Galileo）和开普勒（Kepler）这样的人正在用新的思维和观察方法, 彻底改变人类对自然世界的观念时，启蒙思想家们开始思考：“你知道吗，我在想我们是否能把同样的思维方法, 应用到社会和人类制度上。”* 剧透一下——他们确实这么做了。所以，如果你准备好用大量的理性主义来充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

那么，让我们从启蒙运动的定义开始。嘿，如果你不想把这些都记下来，我这里有这个视频以及我所有视频的笔记指南，你可以点击这里获取。*#启蒙运动是18世纪欧洲的一场知识运动，它将新的理性思维方法, 应用到社会和人类制度上。#*  +

总的来说，这场运动有三个主要的重点，你需要了解。首先，开普勒、牛顿（Newton）、伽利略等人开创的"科学方法", 可以用来改善社会。这被称为"理性主义"，它意味着人类生活中的一切, 都能够且应该接受理性的检验。  +

其次，*#启蒙思想家们相信，既然科学方法可以用来发现"自然规律"，那么它也可以用来发现"社会规律"。#*  +

第三，如果前两点是正确的，那么启蒙思想可以带来人类精神的进步。所以这些就是启蒙运动的重要思想。  +

那么现在让我们深入了解细节，为此，让我给你介绍几位主要的法国哲学家（philosophes）——你知道，“philosophes”是法语中“哲学家”的意思，别搞混了。**启蒙思想首先在法国扎根**的原因是，在那个时期，法国在欧洲大陆上举足轻重。  +

好的，第一个要知道的思想家是孟德斯鸠男爵（Baron de Montesquieu）。作为法国贵族阶级的一员，他非常不喜欢路易十四（Louis XIV）统治下"专制主义"的发展。在孟德斯鸠看来，国王将所有权力集中在自己手中，这种反对意见促使他创作了他最伟大的作品之一，即《论法的精神》（The Spirit of the Laws）。  +

在这本书中，*#孟德斯鸠认为，将权力分散到政府的多个部门，使各部门之间相互制衡，是"避免暴政"并"促进平等"的唯一途径。#*  +

我想介绍的第二位思想家, 是所有法国哲学家中的元老，也就是**伏尔泰**（Voltaire）。他绝对是最著名的哲学家，而且可能是他们作品的最典型代表。*他写了大约70本书，涵盖许多不同的体裁，但它们都有一个共同点——对法国社会和宗教制度的批判。*  +

**伏尔泰对他在法国观察到的"宗教不宽容"现象极为反感。**他在英国待了一段时间，看到因为允许许多不同的宗教版本存在，它们能够和平共处。在法国，天主教被强制施加于民众，伏尔泰认为这是一种压迫。  +

*即便如此，伏尔泰在某种程度上还是支持"专制主义"，因为他认为普通人并不真正有能力管理自己。但他主张"专制主义"必须受到"启蒙思想"的约束。*  +

第三，让我给你介绍德尼·狄德罗（Denis Diderot）。他负责在一部名为《百科全书》（The Encyclopedia）的作品中, 对新的"启蒙世界观"进行编目。狄德罗并没有独自完成整部作品，而是与许多其他启蒙思想家合作，撰写了超过72000篇关于人类生活各个可以想象领域的文章，这些文章都经过了启蒙思想的筛选。  +

很难低估这部作品对启蒙运动传播的影响。它非常畅销。人们开始阅读它，它对人们思考世界的方式产生了重大影响。  +

现在，*除了出版书籍，启蒙思想还通过各种机构传播。例如，在法国，最受欢迎的机构之一是沙龙（salon）(相当于现在的论坛)，这是在豪华住宅中举行的私人聚会，知识分子们在那里公开讨论和辩论当时的新思想。*  +

然后对于不那么富裕的人来说，咖啡馆为人们提供了一个聚集的地方，人们只需花一便士就能买到咖啡，一边喝着足以毒死一匹小马的咖啡，一边讨论当时的新思想。  +

好的，现在启蒙思想家们关注的主要机构之一, 是政府和政治，为此，让我给你介绍另外两位为这方面贡献了他们聪明才智的思想家——约翰·洛克（John Locke）和让 - 雅克·卢梭（Jean-Jacques Rousseau）。  +

当然，这两位思想家之间肯定有细微的差别，但就我们的目的而言，你只需要知道**洛克和卢梭都认同的两个主要概念。**  +

这些人提出的**第一个政治理念是##"自然权利"的概念。这些权利是人们天生就有的 (如, 天赋人权)##**——老实说，这个名字起得很恰当。这里的理念是，*仅仅因为一个人出生在这个世界上，每个人都拥有某些他们应得的权利。*  +

例如，洛克在他的《政府论（下篇）》（Second Treatise on Civil Government）中写道，**#人们生来就拥有生命、自由和财产的权利。而且这些权利是由"造物主"赋予的。#**最后这句话理解起来至关重要。*#如果这些权利是由"造物主"赋予的，那么这意味着它们不是由"君主"赋予的，因此君主不能剥夺或侵犯这些权利。#*  +

在当时笼罩欧洲的"专制主义"环境下，这可是相当激进的观点。  +

这些人提出的**第二个政治理念是##"社会契约"的概念。##**卢梭写了一本名为《社会契约论》（The Social Contract）的书，他在书中认为，*#归根结底，统治的权力掌握在人民手中。为了保护他们的自然权利，人民选择将部分权力交给政府。#*  +

然后**#契约的意义在于，如果政府变成了一个专制的机构，那么人民有权——不，是有责任——废除那个政府，并建立一个维护他们权利的新政府。#**  +

这里的理念是，**#人民只能在自己同意的情况下被统治#，而且统治的根源并不在于君权神授。**这同样是非常激进的观点。  +

现在，当我说卢梭认为"统治的权力掌握在人民手中"时，这并不完全准确。更准确地说，所有男性拥有统治的权力。卢梭认为男人和女人显然是不平等的。他主张女人天生就应该顺从，应该待在家里抚养孩子和给丈夫做三明治。  +

然而，在18世纪后期，像玛丽·沃斯通克拉夫特（Mary Wollstonecraft）这样的女性, 强烈反对这种性别不平等。她的书《女权辩护》（A Vindication of the Rights of Women）认为，女人天生应该和男人拥有平等的权利，而且女人应该有权接受和男人一样的教育。  +

哦，宝贝，让我们继续启蒙思想的进程，看看它是如何应用于经济学的。为此，我需要给你介绍苏格兰启蒙运动时期的**亚当·斯密**（Adam Smith）。  +

**在他的《国富论》（The Wealth of Nations）一书中，斯密批判了欧洲国家的"重商主义"政策。**记住，*重商主义是一种由国家驱动的经济体系。斯密认为，政府应该把手从经济中拿开，而是让人们根据"市场供求规律", 自主做出经济决策。*  +

**他认为，基于"自身利益"而非"国家利益"做出的决策, 最终会带来经济的繁荣。**所以斯密的作品**成为了"自由市场"和"自由贸易"概念的理论基础。**  +

与此同时，被称为"重农学派"（physiocrats）的法国经济思想家们, 也主张类似的经济原则。例如，重农学派的罗伯特（Robert）——罗伯特？这是个法国名字吗？是法国名字，就写罗伯特吧。我不知道。我无法想象一个法国人说“罗伯特”的样子。就说罗伯特吧。  +

罗伯特·雅克·杜尔哥（Robert Jacques Turgot）在法国倡导自由放任的经济学，“laissez-faire”翻译过来就是“放手不管”的意思。他认为政府在经济中应该扮演最小的角色，而是让人们决定他们想买什么，以及他们想为社会贡献什么样的工作。  +

现在，*#宗教和形而上学的信仰, 也受到了启蒙运动的挑战和改变。伏尔泰普及了一种被称为"自然神论"（deism）的信仰。这个观点认为确实存在一个上帝，但上帝不参与人类事务。#*  +

*"自然神论"中的上帝就像一个钟表匠，他把宇宙的所有齿轮组合在一起，然后上紧发条，就让它自行运转，不再进行进一步的干涉。当然，这对基督教是一个严重的挑战，因为基督教强调上帝在人类历史中的奇迹干预——尤其是在基督教信仰的核心，即耶稣基督的肉身复活。*  +

另一位苏格兰思想家**大卫·休谟（David Hume）发展出了"#怀疑主义#"（skepticism）的思想。这里的观点是，#人类所有的知识——我们所有的观念——都是通过我们的感官经验获得的。#**比如，我们品尝东西、触摸东西、听到东西、看到东西，然后我们的大脑把所有这些信息拼凑成关于世界的知识。  +

*##如果我们是这样获取知识的，那么我们的大脑实际上只能反映物质现实中存在的世界。##这进一步意味着，#既然上帝或宇宙的创造, 无法通过我们的感官来验证，那么它们就不是合理的知识范畴。#*  +

最后，狄德罗通过他的《百科全书》普及了无神论（atheism），无神论是指认为上帝不存在的信仰。更确切地说，无神论者是"知道上帝,但有意识地拒绝承认上帝存在"的人。  +

现在，**随着这些对宗教的公开攻击，"宗教信仰"越来越成为"个人"而非"公共"关注的事情 (即, 不是集体信仰, 而是个人信仰)。**这样一来，宗教复兴运动强调个人的虔诚以及个人与上帝的关系。  +

例如，17和18世纪由尼古拉斯·冯·辛岑多夫伯爵（Count Nicolas von Zinzendorf）领导的德国"虔敬主义"（pietism）的兴起，*"虔敬主义"教导说，真正的宗教体验, 不仅仅是属于某个教会，而是与神秘的"个人宗教体验"紧密相连。*  +

在德国的大部分地区，当然，路德教（Lutheranism）是被接受的宗教，但辛岑多夫强烈反对他们所宣扬的对基督的理性主义态度。  +

然后，**受德国"虔敬主义"的影响，一位名叫约翰·卫斯理（John Wesley）的英国圣公会传教士, 开创了"卫理公会"运动（Methodist movement）。卫斯理自己经历了与上帝的强烈个人体验**后，开始在街头和田野布道——这些行为被"圣公会"的当权派认为是非常不恰当的。  +

但**卫斯理认为，真正的基督教是关乎内心的事情，而不是任何外在的事实。因此，要真正认识上帝，一个人必须被强烈的情感所触动。 ** +

Oh my goodness, get ready to crack them brain folds wide open because in this video I'm going to tell you everything you need to know about the Enlightenment for AP European History. And there is a lot.

So as folks like Galileo and Kepler were using new methods of thinking and observation to revolutionize humanity's conception of the natural world, Enlightenment thinkers started thinking, "You know, I wonder if we can apply those same methods of thinking to social and human institutions." And spoiler alert -- that's what they do. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked with a healthy dose of rationalism, let's get to it.

So let's start with the definition of the Enlightenment. And hey, if you don't want to write it all down, then I've got note guides for this video and all my videos you can grab right here. So the Enlightenment was a European intellectual movement in the 18th century that applied new methods of rational thinking to social and human institutions.

In general, there were three main emphases of this movement that you need to know. First, the methods of science pioneered by Kepler and Newton and Galileo and others could be used to improve society. The name for this was rationalism, and it meant that everything in human life could and should be submitted to the process of reason.

Second, Enlightenment thinkers believed that as the scientific method could be used to discover the laws of nature, it could also be used to discover the laws of society.

And third, if both of the first two were true, then Enlightenment thought could lead to progress in the human spirit. So those are the big ideas of the Enlightenment.

So now let's get down and dirty in the details, and for that, let me introduce you to the major French philosophes -- and you know, that's just the French word for philosopher, don't get confused. And the reason Enlightenment thought first took root in France is because France was kind of the biggest deal there was in the European continent during this time.

All right, the first thinker to know is the Baron de Montesquieu. And as a member of France's noble class, he was not a big fan of the growth of absolutism under Louis XIV. To see the king consolidating all the power under himself was to Montesquieu, and that objection animated the production of one of his greatest works, namely The Spirit of the Laws.

In this book, Montesquieu argued that separating power into multiple branches of government so that each branch can check the other was the only way to avoid tyranny and encourage equality.

The second thinker I want to introduce you to is the granddaddy of all French philosophes, namely Voltaire. He was definitely the most famous of the philosophes and probably the most representative of their work. He wrote something like 70 books in many different genres, but it all had one thing in common -- criticism of the social and religious institutions of France.

Voltaire cringed hard at the religious intolerance that he observed in France. And he spent some time in England and saw that because so many competing versions of religion were allowed, they could exist peacefully. In France, where Catholicism was forcibly imposed upon the population, Voltaire viewed it as oppression.

Even so, Voltaire was kind of a big fan of absolutism because he believed that ordinary people weren't really capable of governing themselves. But he argued that absolutism must be tempered by Enlightenment thought.

And third, let me introduce you to Denis Diderot. He was responsible for cataloging the new Enlightenment worldview in a work called The Encyclopedia. Now, Diderot didn't write this whole volume but rather collaborated with many other Enlightenment thinkers to produce over 72,000 articles on every conceivable realm of human life, filtered through the grid of Enlightenment thought.

It's hard to underestimate the influence of this volume on the spread of the Enlightenment. It sold like madness. People began reading it, and it had a significant impact on how they thought about the world.

Now, in addition to publishing books, the ideas of the Enlightenment spread through a variety of institutions. For example, in France, one of the most popular was the salon, which were private meetings held in opulent houses where the intelligentsia openly discussed and debated new ideas of the day.

And then for the less well-off, coffee houses provided a place where folks could gather and buy coffee for a penny and discuss the new ideas of the day while drinking enough caffeine to kill a small horse.

Okay, now one of the major institutions of focus for Enlightenment thinkers was government and politics, and for that, let me introduce you to two other thinkers who contributed their big brains to this endeavor -- John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

Now, there are definitely nuanced differences between these two thinkers, but for our purposes, you just need to know the two main concepts on which Locke and Rousseau agree.

The first political idea these men put forward was the idea of natural rights. And these were rights that people had naturally -- honestly, it's a pretty good name for it. The idea here is that just by virtue of being a human born into the world, everyone had certain rights to which they were entitled.

For example, Locke wrote in his Second Treatise on Civil Government that people were born with rights to life, liberty, and property. And those rights were granted by the Creator. That last phrase is crucial to understand. If those rights are given by the Creator, then that means they are not given by a monarch and thus cannot be taken away or infringed upon by a monarch.

And in the environment of absolutism that had gripped Europe during that time, that was some spicy sauce.

The second political idea these men put forth was the idea of the social contract. Rousseau wrote a book called The Social Contract in which he argued that at the bottom of things, the power to govern was in the hands of the people. In order to protect their natural rights, the people choose to give some of that power over to a government.

And then the contract piece of it means that if the government becomes a tyrannical turd, then the people have the right -- nay, the responsibility -- to abolish that government and establish a new one that upholds their rights.

The idea here is that people can only be governed by their own consent and that the root of governance does not reside in the divine right of kings. That's also getting even spicier.

Now, when I say that Rousseau argued that the power to govern is in the hands of the people, it's not quite accurate. More accurately, all the men have the power to govern. Rousseau believed that men and women were patently not equal. He taught that women were by nature to remain subservient and to stay home raising children and making their husbands sandwiches.

However, in the late 18th century, women like Mary Wollstonecraft objected powerfully to this kind of gendered inequality. Her book A Vindication of the Rights of Women argued that women by nature should have equal rights to men and, moreover, that women should be entitled to the same education as men.

Oh baby, let's keep that Enlightenment thinking train going and see how it applied to economics. And for this, I need to introduce you to Adam Smith of the Scottish Enlightenment.

In his book The Wealth of Nations, Smith hacked the mercantilist policies of European nations. And remember, mercantilism was a state-driven economic system. Smith argued instead that governments ought to get their filthy hands out of the economy and instead let people make the economic decisions based on the laws of supply and demand.

He argued that decisions made in self-interest and not state interest would ultimately lead to a flourishing economy. And so Smith's work became the theoretical basis for concepts of the free market and free trade.

Now, at the same time, French economic thinkers known as the physiocrats were arguing for similar economic principles. For example, physiocrat and Robert -- Robert? Isn't it French? It's French, as it wrote Robert. I don't know. I can't imagine a French person saying Robert. We'll say Robert.

And Robert Jacques Turgot advocated for laissez-faire economics in France, which, when being translated, means "let alone." He argued that the government should have a minimal role in economics and instead let people decide what they wanted to buy and what kind of work they wanted to contribute to society.

Now, religious and metaphysical beliefs were also challenged and changed by the Enlightenment. Voltaire popularized a belief called deism. This is the idea that there was indeed a God but that God was uninvolved in human affairs.

The God of deism was like a clockmaker who put all the gears of the universe together and then wound it up real tight and then just let it tick away without any further interference. Now, this of course was a serious challenge to Christianity, which emphasized the miraculous intervention of God in human history -- not least in the centerpiece of the faith, the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Another Scottish thinker named David Hume developed the idea of skepticism. The idea here is that all human knowledge -- all our ideas -- are gained through our sense experience. Like, we taste things, we touch things, we hear things, we see things, and then our brains cobble all that information together into knowledge about the world.

And if that's how we get knowledge, then our brains can only really reflect the world as it exists in material reality. And that further means that since God or the creation of the universe cannot be mediated through our senses, then they're not legitimate articles of knowledge.

And finally, Diderot, through his Encyclopedia, popularized atheism, which is the belief that no God exists. More to the point, an atheist is someone who knows about God and consciously rejects God's existence.

Now, with these very public attacks on religion, religious belief more and more became a matter of private instead of public concern. This way, religious revival movements emphasized personal piety and individual relationships to God.

For example, the rise of German pietism in the 17th and 18th century, led by Count Nicolas von Zinzendorf, pietism taught that true religious experience was not just about belonging to a church but rather was bound up in the mystical, personal religious experience.

Now, in much of Germany, of course, Lutheranism was the accepted religion, but Zinzendorf reacted strongly against the rationalistic approach to Christ that they preached.

And then, influenced by German pietism, an English Anglican preacher named John Wesley gave birth to the Methodist movement. After Wesley himself had a powerful personal experience with God, he set out preaching in the streets and in the fields -- acts that were considered very improper by the Anglican establishment.

But Wesley argued that true Christianity was a matter of the heart, not any external fact. Therefore, to truly know God, a person had to be seized by a great affection.
