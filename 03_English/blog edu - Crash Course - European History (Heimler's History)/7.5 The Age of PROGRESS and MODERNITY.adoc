All right, late in the 18th century and early 19th century, developments in science on the European continent are going to mess 弄乱；搞糟 Europeans' crap up. They're not going to know which way is up, which way is down, or which way is sideways. So I reckon 认为；估计 we ought to talk about it. So if you're ready to get them brain cows milked with a healthy dose of irrationality 不合理；无理性, let's get to it. +

Now in the last video, we talked about Charles Darwin and his new theory of evolution and natural selection. And Darwin's work caused no small stir 搅动；引起轰动 in the religious world, since his work pointed out that humans have evolved over millions of years and were not necessarily the objects of a special creation of God. +

Now to add to all the scientific overturning 推翻；颠覆 of previously held darlings, these advances in science had other consequences as well, including the rise of positivism 实证主义. This was the idea that any rational 合理的；理性的 conclusion must be able to be scientifically verified 证实；查证；核实 or provable through mathematical quantification 量化. In other words, positivism taught that truth can only be known through science and math. +

On the flip side, if a truth could not be verified in those ways, then it could not be considered truly true. And look, there's gonna be a lot of mind-bending 令人费解的；令人震惊的 realities to explore in this video, so if you need more help, then you can check out my AP Euro review pack with just lots more practice on these issues, and will help you get an A in your class and a five on your exam in May. Link in description. +

Anyway, you can probably already see why this development got a lot of people hot. In Europe, where the majority of people were Christians of various stripes 种类；类型, their entire religion was based not on scientific calculations but on divine 神的；上帝的；神圣的 revelation 启示；揭示 from God. Positivism says that you discover what is true about the world from the inside -- like here's a plant, put it under a microscope; here's an electron, math it out. Christianity teaches that the truest truths of the world come from outside the world, which is to say from God as revealed in the Bible. +

So think about it: the central doctrine 教义；学说 of Christianity is the death and resurrection 复活 of Jesus Christ, and by his blood God's people are atoned for 赎罪 and forgiven. And that is an article of belief, not scientific exploration or mathematical inquiry 探究；调查. Like think about it: even if a scientist possessed a real drop of Christ's blood and that scientist put that blood on a slide under a microscope, that scientist would not see any atonement 赎罪；补偿 or forgiveness in that blood. He would just see blood. Like that's what it is. Atonement and forgiveness are believed, not scientifically proven. Thus, this emerging philosophical movement of positivism was a threat to revealed religion. +

Later in the 19th century, a commitment 承诺；保证；信奉 to this kind of thought had a significant consequence, namely a new relativism 相对主义 in moral values. You see, since positivism obliterated 消灭；清除；废除 the idea that there was one overarching 首要的；支配一切的 truth that applied to everyone everywhere, that meant that all truth was relative 相对的. What's true for you may not be true for me, because we evaluate 评估；评价 that truth from different perspectives 视角；观点, and there's no standard outside of us that can tell us which one of us is right. +

So under this way of thinking, no truth is objective 客观的 but rather relative. It's like that old story of the blind men trying to describe the elephant. Each man felt a different part of the elephant and thus came to different conclusions about what an elephant is like. The blind man holding the elephant's leg said the elephant was like a tree; the man holding the elephant's trunk said an elephant was like a snake. And so you see, Christianity would say we can know the true nature of an elephant because God tells us what the elephant is like. But positivism and the relativism it engendered 产生；引起 said no one can really know for sure which part of the elephant we're holding, so the truth of the elephant's essence 本质；实质 is relative for each person. +

So hopefully you can feel the tension between these two poles. Like on the one hand, the advances in science are creating significant strides 大步；进展 in knowing the world truly, but on the other, the further science advances, the more uncertain things become. The overarching 首要的；支配一切的 name that was given to this growing tension was modernism 现代主义. +

So let's first talk about how modernism was expressed in philosophy, and particularly these philosophers are going to emphasize 强调；着重 not the rational nature of the world but the irrational nature of the world. This is known as -- not surprisingly -- irrationalism 非理性主义, and it challenged the conclusions of the Enlightenment significantly. +

You see, Enlightenment philosophy focused on syllogistic 三段论的；演绎推理的 reasoning -- like if A then B, therefore C -- easy peasy lemon squeezy. But irrationalism broke from this and instead focused on the irrational impulses 冲动；冲动行为 of human nature. They insisted that human life and decisions could not be explained by rational postulates 假定；假设 but rather had to focus on that more ethereal 非现实的；虚幻的 human instinct 本能 called the spirit. +

The poster boy for irrationalism was Friedrich Nietzsche. He argued that reason actually plays a very small role in human life, that most people are governed 统治；控制；支配 instead by their passions 激情；情感 and base instincts. I mean, humans like to think of themselves as rational creatures weighing cause and consequence before making decisions, but Nietzsche came along and was like "Y'all so crazy though." We like to think of ourselves as rational, Nietzsche argued, but we are really governed by emotions and passions. +

And each of thought we got into the sorry state mainly because of Christianity. By his reckoning, the great evil of modern humanity was how enslaved they were to the Christian moral ethic 道德准则 that had been handed down to them, which stifled 扼杀；抑制；压制 creativity under a mountain of ethical obligation. So Nietzsche claims that God was in fact dead, and that the Europeans of this age had killed him, and that created the possibility of the liberation 解放 of humanity. +

Along these same lines, French philosopher Henri Bergson argued that science is good for attaining 获得；得到 practical knowledge of the world. Like it's useful to know that because of the force of gravity you can't just jump out of a window and expect not to be hurt. Like that, all things being equal, is useful. Now it's useful to know that germs cause disease, and it's useful to know what kind of chemicals can cure those diseases. For those kinds of questions, Bergson argued, science is great. +

But then he argued that science breaks down when trying to analyze and describe the essence of true reality. Reality, Bergson argued, could only be experienced intuitively 凭直觉地；直观地, not analyzed scientifically. So in this way, such philosophies taught societal progress was achieved not mainly by rational scientific postulates but through struggle and conflict. +

Now this emphasis on irrationalism was also applied to the new field of psychology thanks to Sigmund Freud, who applied these ideas to the internal world of the human personality. He argued that human behavior was governed and determined not by the rational choice of the individual but rather by the subconscious 潜意识的；下意识的 of the person, which was shaped by the experiences of childhood. Again, we like to think we make our own rational decisions in our lives, but Freud would say no -- human decisions are largely the product of all those childhood traumas 创伤；痛苦经历 that you have repressed 压抑；抑制 and are struggling to make it back into your conscious awareness. That's what's making your decisions, not your pristine 清新的；纯净的 thinky-thinky part. +

Freud developed a method for tracing 追踪；追溯 these links from the conscious to the subconscious called psychoanalysis 精神分析. And though many of his ideas were later proven wrong, his advances laid the groundwork for the field of psychology. +

And finally, these new developments in the irrational nature of life were applied to the natural sciences. Now remember from unit 4 that according to Newtonian physics 牛顿物理学, the physical world was objectively knowable through rational engagement. Oh look, drop an apple and it falls to the floor, and we can predict the rate of its falling with an equation. Oh look, planets move in ellipses 椭圆 around the sun, and we can model the exact paths of those planets. +

Then scientists came along in the late 19th century and early 20th century to completely ruin that predictable, tidy, rational way of knowing the world. They said, "Oh no, just go one click below all of these immutable 不可改变的；永恒的 laws of the universe and you'll see that everything is chaos." +

One such scientist was physicist Max Planck. Before Planck came along, the prevailing 普遍的；流行的；占优势的 theory of atoms and atomic structure was that they were hard bits of matter that behaved predictably. And don't miss that we're talking about atoms -- like the very building blocks of reality as we know it. According to the prevailing theory, reality is predictable and can be described predictably. +

But Planck discovered that atoms radiated 辐射；放射 heat not in constant flows but in erratic 不稳定的；无规律的 packets called quanta 量子. And you, like me, do not really need to understand exactly what that means. The thing you need to take away from that is that Planck's quantum mechanics 量子力学 show that atoms behave irrationally, not along rigidly predetermined 预先确定的；预先决定的 processes. In other words, the world at the atomic level was actually chaotic 混乱的；无序的 and unpredictable. +

The point is, after Planck's work, the Newtonian universe was no longer able to adequately describe reality, and that was an unsettling 令人不安的；令人担忧的 thought. +

== 中文释义

好的，在18世纪后期和19世纪早期，欧洲大陆的科学发展把欧洲人搞得晕头转向。他们不知道上下左右，不知所措。所以我觉得我们应该谈谈这个。所以，如果你准备好以一种非理性的方式充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

在上一个视频中，我们谈到了查尔斯·达尔文（Charles Darwin）以及他的进化和自然选择新理论。达尔文的工作在宗教界引起了不小的轰动，因为他的工作指出人类是在数百万年的时间里进化而来的，不一定是上帝特殊创造的产物。  +

除了科学对先前被珍视的观念的颠覆之外，这些科学进步还有其他后果，包括实证主义（positivism）的兴起。实证主义认为任何理性的结论都必须能够通过科学验证，或者通过数学量化来证明。换句话说，实证主义教导说，真理只能通过科学和数学来认识。  +

另一方面，如果一个真理不能以这些方式得到验证，那么它就不能被认为是真正的真理。听着，在这个视频中会有很多令人费解的现实需要探索，所以如果你需要更多帮助，你可以查看我的美国大学预修课程欧洲历史复习资料包，里面有很多关于这些问题的练习，会帮助你在课堂上得A，并在五月份的考试中得5分。描述中有链接。  +

不管怎样，你可能已经明白为什么这种发展让很多人激动不已。在欧洲，大多数人是不同教派的基督徒，他们的整个宗教是基于上帝的神圣启示，而不是科学计算。实证主义说你从内部发现关于世界的真理——比如这里有一株植物，把它放在显微镜下；这里有一个电子，用数学计算它。基督教教导说，世界最真实的真理来自世界之外，也就是说来自《圣经》中所启示的上帝。  +

所以想一想：基督教的核心教义是耶稣基督的死亡和复活，通过他的血，上帝的子民得到救赎和宽恕。这是一种信仰条款，而不是科学探索或数学探究。比如想一想：即使一位科学家拥有真正的基督之血，并把这血放在显微镜的载玻片上，这位科学家在这血液中也看不到任何救赎或宽恕。他只会看到血液。就是这样。救赎和宽恕是被信仰的，而不是科学证明的。因此，这种新兴的实证主义哲学运动对启示宗教构成了威胁。  +

在19世纪后期，对这种思想的信奉产生了重大后果，即道德价值观方面的新相对主义。你看，由于实证主义抹杀了存在适用于各地所有人的总体真理这一观念，这意味着所有真理都是相对的。对你来说是真理的东西，对我来说可能不是真理，因为我们从不同的角度评估那个真理，而且在我们之外没有标准能告诉我们谁是对的。  +

所以在这种思维方式下，没有真理是客观的，而是相对的。就像那个盲人摸象的老故事一样。每个盲人摸到大象的不同部位，因此对大象的样子得出了不同的结论。摸到大象腿的盲人说大象像一棵树；摸到大象鼻子的盲人说大象像一条蛇。所以你看，基督教说我们能知道大象的真实本质，因为上帝告诉我们大象是什么样的。但实证主义以及它所产生的相对主义说，没有人能确切知道我们摸到的是大象的哪个部位，所以大象本质的真理对每个人来说都是相对的。  +

希望你能感受到这两个极端之间的紧张关系。一方面，科学的进步在真正认识世界方面取得了重大进展，但另一方面，科学越进步，事情就变得越不确定。这种日益增长的紧张关系的总称为现代主义（modernism）。  +

所以让我们首先谈谈现代主义在哲学上的表现，特别是这些哲学家强调的不是世界的理性本质，而是世界的非理性本质。这被称为——并不奇怪——非理性主义（irrationalism），它对启蒙运动的结论提出了重大挑战。  +

你看，启蒙哲学专注于三段论推理——比如如果A，那么B，所以C——轻而易举。但非理性主义打破了这一点，而是专注于人性的非理性冲动。他们坚持认为，人类的生活和决策不能用理性假设来解释，而必须专注于被称为精神的更虚幻的人类本能。  +

非理性主义的代表人物是弗里德里希·尼采（Friedrich Nietzsche）。他认为，理性在人类生活中实际上只起很小的作用，大多数人是由他们的激情和基本本能所支配的。我的意思是，人类喜欢认为自己是理性的生物，在做决定之前会权衡因果关系，但尼采出现了，他说：“你们都太疯狂了。”尼采认为，我们喜欢认为自己是理性的，但我们实际上是由情感和激情所支配的。  +

而且我们陷入这种糟糕状态的原因主要是基督教。在他看来，现代人类的巨大罪恶在于他们被传承下来的基督教道德伦理所奴役，这种道德伦理在大量的伦理义务之下扼杀了创造力。所以尼采宣称上帝实际上已经死亡，这个时代的欧洲人杀死了上帝，这为人类的解放创造了可能性。  +

沿着同样的思路，法国哲学家亨利·柏格森（Henri Bergson）认为，科学对于获得关于世界的实用知识是有益的。就像知道由于重力的作用，你不能直接跳出窗外还期望不受伤，这是有用的。类似地，知道细菌会导致疾病是有用的，知道什么样的化学物质可以治愈那些疾病也是有用的。柏格森认为，对于这些问题，科学非常伟大。  +

但然后他认为，当试图分析和描述真实世界的本质时，科学就失效了。柏格森认为，现实只能通过直觉来体验，而不能通过科学分析来认识。所以这样，这些哲学教导说，社会的进步不是主要通过理性的科学假设来实现的，而是通过斗争和冲突来实现的。  +

由于西格蒙德·弗洛伊德（Sigmund Freud），这种对非理性主义的强调也被应用到了心理学的新领域。他把这些思想应用到人类个性的内在世界。他认为，人类的行为不是由个人的理性选择所支配和决定的，而是由个人的潜意识所支配和决定的，而潜意识是由童年的经历塑造的。同样，我们喜欢认为我们在生活中做出的是理性的决定，但弗洛伊德会说不是——人类的决定在很大程度上是所有那些被压抑的童年创伤的产物，而这些创伤正努力回到我们的意识层面。是这些在影响我们做决定，而不是我们纯粹的思考部分。  +

弗洛伊德开发了一种方法，用于追溯从意识层面到潜意识层面的这些联系，这种方法被称为精神分析（psychoanalysis）。尽管他的许多观点后来被证明是错误的，但他的进步为心理学领域奠定了基础。  +

最后，这些关于生活的非理性本质的新发展也被应用到了自然科学中。还记得在第四单元中，根据牛顿物理学（Newtonian physics），物理世界可以通过理性探索客观地被认识。比如，扔下一个苹果，它会落到地上，我们可以用一个方程式来预测它下落的速度。再比如，行星围绕太阳做椭圆运动，我们可以模拟出这些行星的确切运动轨迹。  +

然后在19世纪后期和20世纪早期，科学家们出现了，他们完全打破了那种可预测、整洁、理性的认识世界的方式。他们说：“哦，不，只要深入到宇宙的这些不变定律之下，你就会发现一切都是混乱的。”  +

这样的一位科学家是物理学家马克斯·普朗克（Max Planck）。在普朗克出现之前，关于原子和原子结构的主流理论是，它们是表现可预测的坚硬物质微粒。不要忽略我们正在谈论的是原子——就像我们所知道的现实的基本组成部分。根据主流理论，现实是可预测的，并且可以被可预测地描述。  +

但普朗克发现，原子辐射热量不是以连续的流动形式，而是以被称为量子（quanta）的不稳定的能量包形式。你和我一样，其实不需要确切理解那意味着什么。你需要从这里面明白的是，普朗克的量子力学表明，原子的行为是非理性的，不是沿着严格预先确定的过程。换句话说，原子层面的世界实际上是混乱和不可预测的。  +

重点是，在普朗克的工作之后，牛顿的宇宙再也不能充分描述现实了，这是一个令人不安的想法。  +
