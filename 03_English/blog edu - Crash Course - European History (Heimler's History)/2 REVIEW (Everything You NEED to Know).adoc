Unit two of the AP European History curriculum 美国大学预修课程欧洲历史课程的第二单元 is so important to understand if you want an A in your class and a five on your exam in May. You have to know what happened in the Protestant Reformation 新教改革 and the wars of religion 宗教战争 that follow. And guess what? That's exactly what I'm about to review for you. So if you're ready to get that brain cows milked, let's get to it. +
Now back in 1054, we had the first major split 重大分裂 of the Christian church, and that split gave us the Roman Catholic Church 罗马天主教会 and the Eastern Orthodox Church 东正教教会. Since that split, it was the Roman Catholic Church that dominated Western Europe. You know, if you were alive back then, you didn't like the Catholic Church. It's not like you could have gone down the street to the Baptist church 浸信会教堂 or the Methodist church 卫理公会教堂 or whatever. You had one option, and that option was Catholic. By the way, if you want note guides 笔记指南 for this video and a bunch of other stuff to help you with this unit and all the other units, check out my AP European History Ultimate Review Packet 美国大学预修课程欧洲历史终极复习资料包，which is linked in the description below. +
Now by the 1500s, the Catholic Church had gotten itself all kinds of tangled up 陷入；卷入 in politics, and it accumulated 积累 a metric butt load of 大量的 wealth. And some of those entanglements 牵连；纠葛 led to corruption 腐败. You need to know a few of these. First was simony 买卖圣职，which was the buying and selling of church offices 教会职位. I mean, you would expect that the church office of archbishop 大主教，for example, would be reserved for the most pious 虔诚的，most experienced man. But no, in this period, church offices went to the guy who had the requisite 必要的；必需的 amount of boom boom （此处指钱） to buy his way into the office. +
Second was nepotism 任人唯亲，which meant the appointing of family and friends to church offices. Again, people got church offices not because they were qualified 有资格的；胜任的 but because of who they were related to. Third, and maybe most important for our purposes, was the buying and selling of indulgences 赎罪券. Essentially 本质上，this was the church offering a way for people to buy their salvation 救赎 or maybe buy loved ones out of purgatory 炼狱. And the church justified 为…… 辩解 these kind of behaviors because hey, Saint Peter's Basilica 圣彼得大教堂 ain't going to renovate 翻新；整修 itself. +
Now right into this nasty soup of corruption came an Augustinian monk 奥古斯丁修道士 and Christian humanist 基督教人文主义者 named Martin Luther 马丁・路德. His grievances 不满；抱怨 began when Luther was studying the book of Romans 《罗马书》 in the New Testament 《新约圣经》, which taught that a person's salvation was by grace alone through faith 因信称义 -- or to put it another way, salvation is free, paid for by Christ himself. This of course sharply contrasted with 与…… 形成鲜明对比 the church's position that salvation was earned by faith and good works 善功，not to mention buying it through indulgences. +
Now Luther also came to believe that the scriptures 经文；《圣经》 alone ought to be the sole authority 唯一权威 of Christians, which is to say not the pope 教皇 and not the elaborate 复杂的 system of church dogma 教会教义. Furthermore 此外，he also saw that the scriptures did not endorse 认可；支持 the hierarchy 等级制度 of believers into sacred 神圣的 and secular 世俗的 realms 领域，but instead the scriptures taught the priesthood of all believers 所有信徒皆为祭司. I hope by now you can start to taste the sauce that Martin Luther was cooking up, because it was spicy. +
And so all of this came to a head 达到顶点 on October 31, 1517. Luther composed 撰写 a document containing 95 theses 95 条论纲 criticizing the corruption of the church and calling the church and its leaders to reform. He nailed his 95 theses to the Wittenberg church door 维滕贝格教堂大门，and it was on like Donkey Kong. Now to be fair, Luther didn't intend 打算 these theses to be a broad proclamation 广泛宣告 throughout all of Europe for a new way to believe. It was really only meant to spark 引发；激发 a discussion among a few educated monks and priests. But because of the printing press 印刷机，the 95 theses were spread throughout the German states 德意志邦国 of the Holy Roman Empire 神圣罗马帝国 with great speed. And apparently many other Germans felt the same way about the Catholic Church's abuses 弊端 because Luther's theses were widely embraced 接受. +
Now once Luther's complaints and new interpretations of the scriptures made it to the church officials, they went ahead and denounced 谴责 him as a heretic 异教徒，which is a person who rejects the accepted beliefs of the church. Now those officials went ahead and put Luther on trial 审判 at the Diet of Worms 沃尔姆斯议会，at which they demanded Luther's recantation 撤回；放弃（信仰等）. Luther refused to recant, and so they excommunicated 逐出教会 him. He then went into hiding under the protection of his prince, Frederick III 弗雷德里克三世，who is one of the many German princes who supported Luther. That's not because they were moved deeply by his writings and repented 忏悔 in dust and ashes and begged Luther to let them help spread these life-changing ideas. +
Now these princes understood that if they supported Luther, that would weaken the pope's power, and that means German princes would in turn 反过来 have more power. So in a very real way, we can say that Luther wasn't the chief Protestant reformer but rather the princes who protested 抗议 the Catholic Church and supported Luther's work. +
Now if you know your European history, you know that Luther was not the first reformer to criticize the Catholic Church. He had Christian humanists like John Wycliffe 约翰・威克里夫 and Jan Huss 扬・胡斯 who did it before Luther and really planted the seeds of 播下…… 的种子 the Protestant Reformation. So the real question is why was it Luther's protest that ultimately split the church? Well, that brings us back to the printing press. Luther was the first major reformer to have access to 使用；接近 this new printing technology. +
And by this point, there were three major kinds of publications 出版物 coming out of the printing houses 印刷厂: books, pamphlets 小册子，and broadsides 大幅传单. And Luther made proficient use of 熟练使用 all three but especially pamphlets. By 1520, there was something like 300,000 copies of his pamphlets all across Germany and as far away as England. Furthermore, as an Augustinian monk, Luther used to preach 布道；讲道 to the people in German, not Latin, because you know he wanted ordinary people to understand the doctrines of grace 恩典教义. Therefore, his production of a vernacular Bible 白话《圣经》 in German spread far and wide thanks to the printing press. If you don't know the word vernacular 白话；方言，it just means the common language of the people. And that German Bible had a way of confirming 证实；确认 Protestant doctrine 新教教义. For example, when everyone could read a book like the Bible -- not just priests and bishops -- it gave support to the Reformation doctrine of the priesthood of all believers. +
So that was how the Protestant Reformation began, leading to the second major split in the Christian church. So that was happening in the German states, but as I said, thanks to the printing press, the ideas of the Reformation spread quickly. And the next significant place the Reformation took root 扎根 was Switzerland under the leadership of a guy named John Calvin 约翰・加尔文. +
Now Calvin was originally a follower of Martin Luther, but the two split over 因…… 分裂 varying interpretations of the doctrine of salvation 救赎教义. Now Calvin was known for two major Protestant theological 神学的 developments. First was the doctrine of predestination 预定论，which said that God had from before the foundation of the world decided who would be saved and who would not. Therefore, salvation was not a matter of human choice but God's choice. Second was the doctrine of the elect 选民教义. Those whom God had chosen to save were the elect 选民，and those who were truly elect had no choice in the matter and further could never lose their salvation. +
Now how did a person know he or she was a member of the elect? Well, simply because they desired salvation. Furthermore, a person was elect if their salvation led to good works. And to be clear, this was different from the Catholic doctrine 教义. Catholics taught that faith and good works were necessary for salvation. Calvin argued that only by faith was a person saved, but if they were truly elect, that salvation would naturally result in good works. +
Additionally 此外，Calvin taught that wealth accumulation 财富积累 would be a sign of a person's election, although he tempered 缓和；调节 that by teaching that a person's wealth was still governed by 受…… 支配 the law of love. A Christian therefore had an obligation 义务 to use wealth to care for the poor. And as a direct result of this teaching, Calvin set up a welfare state 福利国家 in Geneva 日内瓦. +
Now the last thing I'll say about Calvin's Geneva is this: the church and the state were so tightly tied together 紧密相连 that you really couldn't tell where one started and the other ended. In Geneva, the Bible was the law, and this resulted in a kind of theocracy 神权政治，which is when a state is ruled not by a human ruler but directly by God. For example, citizens of Geneva were required by law to attend church five days a week. And if you were caught skipping those services enough times, don't worry, they would just excommunicate you or put you in jail. Under Calvin's direction in Geneva, the people couldn't drink, couldn't dance, couldn't swear. So you know, all good in Geneva. It was by these rules that Calvin was able to control the population in Geneva. After all, Calvin taught that it was the elect who obeyed such rules, and everyone wanted to be part of the elect, right? +
Now Calvin also benefited tremendously 极大地 from the printing press as well. He laid down 阐述；制定 all of his ideas in a hefty volume 厚书 called The Institutes of the Christian Religion 《基督教要义》. The Institutes was the first complete treatment 论述 of Reformation doctrines, and the printing press enabled 使能够 Calvin's work to spread throughout Europe. And what it did was to provide the needed doctrinal order 教义秩序 to Protestant churches. As Calvinism 加尔文主义 spread throughout Europe, it created the Presbyterians 长老会 in Scotland 苏格兰，the Huguenots 胡格诺派 in France 法国，and the Puritans 清教徒 in England 英格兰. So Calvin's Protestantism 新教，while it held to 坚持 the same basic principles as Luther's doctrine, developed its own distinctives 特色. +
Now another Protestant group that became a distinct entity 独立实体 during this time was the Anabaptists 再洗礼派，who believed in the Reformation principles that Luther and Calvin did but they separated from them on the question of baptism 洗礼. Calvin and Luther taught that infants 婴儿 could be baptized 施洗，and on this they agreed with the Catholic Church. And the Baptists 浸信会，on the other hand, believed that baptism could not be performed on infants on account of 因为 it was a rite 仪式 that only adults could participate in, because only adults could truly affirm 确认 that they were believers. So for Anabaptists, the baby dunking （此处指给婴儿施洗） was out. +
Also out for the Anabaptists was military service 服兵役. They believed in the absolute separation between church and state -- that a person's commitment to God wholesale 完全地 trumped 胜过 their commitment to the state. So they were pacifists 和平主义者 and refused to be conscripted 征召入伍 for the wars that their states got themselves into. +
And speaking of wars, many of these conflicts in the church that I've just been talking about led to actual armed conflicts 武装冲突 between European states, and we call those Europe's wars of religion. We'll talk about France and the Holy Roman Empire in this respect. +
First, France. In the first half of the 1500s, most French people were Catholic. But by the 1500s, Protestantism had gained a significant foothold 立足点，and those French folks who embraced Protestantism were known as the Huguenots. As it turned out, nearly half of the French nobles 贵族 had converted to Calvinism 加尔文主义 and were seeking recognition and rights from the crown 王室. In 1560, Charles IX 查理九世 took the throne 登基，but he was a wee little thing coming in at only 11 years old. Therefore, his mother, Catherine de Medici 凯瑟琳・德・美第奇，was basically running the kingdom and wanted to purge 清除 France of the Huguenots and therefore to diminish 削弱 the power of the Protestant nobles. And remember, that's a power move 权力举措. If the whole country was singular in its religious allegiance 宗教忠诚，then those loyalties would merge with 与…… 融合 their political allegiance, and that would create a stronger, more powerful government. +
Now the French wars of religion began with a massacre 大屠杀 of Huguenots led by the Bourbon family 波旁家族 in 1562 known as the Massacre of Vassy 瓦西大屠杀，in which members of the Catholic Guise family 吉斯家族 stormed 突袭 their worship service 礼拜仪式 and began killing them indiscriminately 不加区别地；肆意地. So that was rough. But it got even worse in 1572 when Charles the Ninth's sister married Bourbon Henry of Navarre 纳瓦拉的亨利・波旁，who was also a Huguenot. And he invited many prominent 杰出的 Huguenots to the wedding. And Catherine de Medici, crafty 狡猾的 lady that she was, organized a massacre of the Huguenots that became known as the Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre 圣巴托洛缪之夜大屠杀. And as the massacre spread beyond the wedding, something like 10 to 20,000 Protestants were killed. As it turns out, Henry's life was spared 幸免 because he promised he would convert to Catholicism, which he did. +

And you know, speaking of the church being divided, let's return to the Catholic Church 天主教会 now. Basically, the whole time that Europeans were slaughtering 屠杀 each other during the religious wars 宗教战争, the Catholic Church was undergoing 经历 a reformation 改革 of its own known as the Catholic Reformation 天主教改革, or you might hear it called the Counter-Reformation 反宗教改革. In response to 回应 the criticisms leveled at 针对……提出的批评 the church from the likes of 像……之类的 Martin Luther and John Calvin, Catholic leaders decided to clean up their house 整顿内部事务. +

Now I should probably also mention that the Catholics started reforming themselves for a number of reasons. Yes, they were responding to the ideological 意识形态的 criticism of the Protestant reformers 新教改革者, but they also sought to reform themselves because they were losing lots of people to the Protestant side. So you could equally argue that the Catholics reformed themselves to maintain power and influence 维持权力和影响力 among their people. +

Anyway, Pope Paul III 教皇保罗三世 established the Roman Inquisition 罗马宗教裁判所, which had the authority 权力 to arrest and execute 逮捕和处决 heretics 异教徒. Doesn't that smell a little Machiavellian 马基雅维利式的（指为达目的不择手段的）? Connections, baby. We're making those connections. The church is doing whatever it can to maintain power, including fear and intimidation 恐吓. Additionally 此外, the church established an Index of Prohibited Books 禁书目录, which was a list of books that taught heretical 异端的 doctrines 教义, and it included works by the Christian humanist Erasmus 伊拉斯谟（基督教人文主义者） and several Protestant reformers as well. +

But without doubt, the most significant act of the Catholic Reformation was the Council of Trent 特伦托会议, which met intermittently 间歇地 from 1545 to 1563. Its purpose was to reform the Catholic Church and forge 建立 some reconciliation 和解 with Protestants. The council made some gains on the former but basically did nothing on the latter. So at the council, the church began to clean up some of its corrupt practices 腐败行为 that caused the Protestants so much angst 焦虑. It suppressed 禁止 simony 买卖圣职 and forbade 禁止 the sale of indulgences 赎罪券. Also, the council reaffirmed 重申 the celibacy 独身 of the clergy 神职人员. You know, medieval priests 中世纪的牧师 were a little loose with this one, to put it mildly 委婉地说. And with these corruptions purged 清除, the Catholic Church experienced a spiritual renewal 精神复兴 in what was established in the council lasted to the middle of the 20th century. +

Now the council also reaffirmed classical Catholic doctrines 天主教经典教义 like transubstantiation 圣体圣事（天主教认为面包和葡萄酒在弥撒中变成耶稣的身体和血）, equal authority of the pope and the scriptures 教皇和《圣经》具有平等权威, in the seven sacraments 七大圣礼, etc. And so by doing this, reconciliation with Protestants was not possible. In reaffirming these doctrines, the council permanently cemented 巩固 the division in Christianity 基督教的分裂. +

Regardless 不管怎样, the Catholic Church itself continued to experience renewal 复兴, and one of the manifestations 表现形式 of that was the establishment of new religious orders 宗教修会. Saint Theresa of Avila 阿维拉的圣特蕾莎 established the Carmelite order 加尔默罗会, and she founded numerous convents 女修道院 and brought their order back to a stricter form of the faith, emphasizing asceticism 苦行 and poverty 贫穷. Probably the most significant new order to be established was the Jesuits 耶稣会. It was founded by Ignatius of Loyola 依纳爵·罗耀拉 for the purpose of spiritual renewal 精神复兴, and members of the order took vows of poverty and chastity 贫穷和贞洁誓言, and they established schools and far-reaching missionary efforts 广泛的传教活动. It was the Jesuits that brought Catholicism 天主教 to India and Japan and Brazil and North America and Africa. But they also concentrated their missionary efforts at home, and through their work, many of the southern provinces of the Holy Roman Empire 神圣罗马帝国 returned to Catholicism. +

Okay, let's turn the corner now and look at this period from the bottom up 从底层视角来看. We've talked a lot about the major figures and rulers so far, but now let's talk about the people. And I reckon 认为 we ought to begin with the social hierarchy 社会等级制度. Social hierarchies define a person's social status 社会地位 regarding class 阶级 and religion 宗教 and gender 性别 in both rural 农村的 and urban 城市的 settings. +

Now prior to this period 在这一时期之前, a person's class 阶级 was established at birth by one's wealth and family. But with the rise of the merchant elite 商人精英, some of whom became very wealthy, movement upward 向上流动 was now a possibility, which is to say class status 阶级地位 was not necessarily connected with land 土地 anymore nor your family of origin 出身家庭. Even so, land ownership 土地所有权 still held quite a bit of prestige 声望. For example, in the English Parliament 英国议会, the upper house 上议院, the House of Lords 贵族院, was reserved for the landed citizens 拥有土地的公民, while the lower house 下议院, the House of Commons 下议院, was reserved for those without land, even if some of them were very wealthy. +

When it came to religion 说到宗教, a person's beliefs certainly mattered in terms of social standing 社会地位. Recall 回想 that if you were a Huguenot 胡格诺派 in Catholic France 天主教法国, you stood a good chance of getting slaughtered at a wedding. Additionally 此外, the Spanish throne 西班牙王室 took pains to 努力 expel 驱逐 the Jews from their land. So yeah, you needed to believe the right thing if you were gonna live the good life in Europe. +

In terms of gender 就性别而言, patriarchy 父权制 was the order of the day 当时的社会秩序, which meant that it was a male-dominated society 男性主导的社会. Women were expected to submit to 服从 their husbands and fathers, and their earnings 收入 belonged to the men in their lives. So it shouldn't surprise you to hear that women were largely excluded from 被排除在……之外 the economic and political life of Europe. This was connected to the entire political structure 政治结构 of the European states. For example, Charles the First of England 英格兰的查理一世 understood himself as the father of the nation 国家之父, and only if the family hierarchy 家庭等级制度 was preserved would his own authority 权威 be preserved. +

Now this standard was more evident 明显的 in urban wealthy families where they had more freedom to order their households 安排家庭事务. In rural households 农村家庭, men and women were more equal, even though there were separate spheres of work 不同的工作领域 for both in certain roles that they each fulfilled 履行. Regardless 不管怎样, urban and rural households organized themselves around the nuclear family 核心家庭 instead of the extended family 大家庭. +

Now as it happened 碰巧, the Renaissance 文艺复兴 and Reformation 宗教改革 raised debates about this patriarchal structure 父权制结构 in women's proper role in society 女性在社会中的适当角色. Among French intellectuals 法国知识分子, they debated what they called the querelle des femmes （法语）“女性问题”, which when being translated means "the woman question." Mainly, it was a debate over whether women were fit to 适合 receive university education 接受大学教育. On one side, folks argued that no, they were not fit, since women were naturally inferior to 不如 men. And how did they know? Well, wasn't it Eve 夏娃 who was deceived by the serpent 蛇 and led the entire human race into sin and misery 罪恶与苦难? And then the other side of the argument went like this: if women are inferior, it's only because men have withheld 拒绝给予 education from them. After all, look at Queen Elizabeth in England -- she was educated and ruled like a boss. +

In the Catholic Church, women of course could not be priests 牧师 and furthermore could hold no position of authority 权威职位 over a man. But they could become nuns 修女, and that was something. In the context of a convent 女修道院, nuns had the opportunity to use their artistic or medical or leadership gifts 在女性群体中发挥她们的艺术、医学或领导才能 in the context of a community of women. +

Now on the Protestant side of things 在新教方面, Luther and Calvin both taught that the wife ought to be subservient to 顺从 her husband and put herself on display as the model of obedience 服从 and charity 慈善. But it was only the Anabaptists 再洗礼派 who gave women positions of authority 权威职位, and some of them even became preachers 传教士. And out of all the Anabaptists who were martyred 殉道 during this period, nearly a third of them were women in leadership. +

Now during this period, with so many people moving from the country into the city and with a larger challenge to religious authority 宗教权威 occurring because of the Reformation, city governments were left with the task of creating laws to legislate 制定法律规范 public morals 公共道德 where the church did this before. Now the task was falling on secular authorities 世俗当局. So for example, during this period, many municipal authorities 市政当局 outlawed 取缔 prostitution 卖淫. Protestants believed that marriage was the only legitimate remedy 合法解决办法 for lust 情欲. Therefore, they worked to get local governments to pass laws to close and ban brothels 妓院. +

In some places, authorities tried to restrict 限制 the festivities 庆祝活动 during a yearly celebration of Carnival 狂欢节. Since medieval times 中世纪以来, this was a festival held right before Lent 大斋期（教会的斋戒季节）, and people went positively crazy during Carnival. They got drunk and danced for days, dressed up as people in authority 装扮成权威人士 like kings and popes, and so it was kind of an upside-down society 颠倒的社会 for a few days. But because it was motivated by the Catholic doctrine of penance 天主教的忏悔教义 during Lent, some Protestant leaders attempted to make laws restricting the excesses 过度行为 of Carnival. However, in more rural areas far from the reach of the state, people persisted in 坚持 celebrating like this. +

Now in order to keep everyone in line 使每个人遵守秩序, local and church authorities had certain public punishments and humiliations 公开惩罚和羞辱 to keep the populace 民众 from violating 违反 certain legal and social norms 法律和社会规范. If you broke the law, you might find yourself in the stocks 颈手枷, in which your head, arms, and feet were restrained 束缚 in blocks of wood. But don't worry, it was usually right in the center of town so that any passerby 路人 could hurl 投掷 rotten food and waste at the prisoner. Also, there was flogging 鞭打 with a cane 藤条 or a whip 鞭子, and sometimes you got flogged before you went in the stock. So you know, that was a bad day. +

Even so, with the rise of capitalism 资本主义 -- on which more in the next unit -- a new culture of leisure 休闲文化 was on the rise. In their free time, people began attending in greater numbers blood sports 血腥运动 like boxing 拳击 or bullfighting 斗牛 or jousting 骑士比武. Additionally 此外, saints' days festivities 圣徒节庆祝活动 drew huge crowds for celebrations according to the church calendar 教会日历. For example, All Saints' Day 诸圣节 was a festival celebrating all the saints that have departed 已故圣徒. They maintained a strong belief in the mystical connection 神秘联系 between the church triumphant 得胜教会（指已升入天堂的圣徒） -- which is those who have already reached heaven -- and the church militant 奋战教会（指仍在世上的信徒） -- which were those who are still alive on earth. +

The last thing I'll say about society during this period is this: even with all the religious and political upheaval 动荡 occurring, many people still held on to 坚持 folk ideas 民间观念 that have been passed down through the generations 代代相传. Related to that was the witchcraft craze 巫术热潮 of the 16th and 17th centuries. To Catholic and Protestant leaders during this time, witchcraft 巫术 was evidence of a pact with the devil 与魔鬼的契约 and thus ought to be feared and extinguished 消灭. Before the advent of science 在科学出现之前, many common illnesses or unfortunate events were attributed to 归因于 witches 女巫. The belief grew that witches were in league with 与……勾结 the devil to overthrow Christianity 推翻基督教. And so with the stakes getting higher and higher 风险越来越高, the stage was set for a witch hunt 猎巫行动. +

Historians estimate that in the 16th and 17th centuries, between 40 to 60,000 people were executed 处决 for witchcraft, the majority of them women. And that takes us right back to the belief that women were inferior 低等的. It was believed that women were not as morally strong as men and therefore were more susceptible to 易受……影响 agreement with the devil. Three-quarters of those executions occurred in the Holy Roman Empire alone. And why is that? Well, it's hard to know for sure, but think of this: it was within the Holy Roman Empire that the Protestant Reformation began, which resulted in serious social upheaval 社会动荡. Additionally, these people experienced a great deal of destruction and death during the Thirty Years' War 三十年战争. So it could be that those people were attempting to regain some control of their lives by scapegoating 把……当作替罪羊 women as witches. +

Okay, now the last thing we need to do in this unit is talk about art. Mannerism 风格主义 developed during the Renaissance, and it was an art form in which artists made use of 利用 distorted figures 扭曲的人物形象, large musculature 夸张的肌肉线条, and vibrant color 鲜艳的色彩 in order to communicate deep emotion and drama 传达深刻的情感和戏剧性. A great example of mannerism is Michelangelo's The Last Judgment 米开朗基罗的《最后的审判》 in the Sistine Chapel 西斯廷教堂. I mean, if you want drama, it's all here. It's judgment day 审判日, and here you see the damned 受诅咒的人 in a pretty bad way while the saints 圣徒 are rising to bliss 升入极乐世界. +

But also during this period, a new innovation in art developed called Baroque 巴洛克艺术. It was extravagant 奢华的 in form, ornate 华丽的 and detailed in style, and highly emotional and dramatic 极具情感和戏剧性的. It began in Rome during the Catholic Reformation. As the church was undergoing renewal 复兴, they sought to appeal to 吸引 the people and persuade them to reinvest their confidence in the church. It was precisely this ornate and dramatic style by which the Catholics sought to critique 批判 the often barren 单调的 and muted 沉闷的 styles of Protestant art. It was also a sign of wealth and power 财富和权力的象征, and the more ornate and the greater the size of the cathedral 大教堂, the more it would reflect the power which the Catholic church was so desperately trying to hold on to 维持 during this period. +

Probably the greatest artist in the Baroque style was Peter Paul Rubens 彼得·保罗·鲁本斯. Look here at this painting, The Elevation of the Cross  《举起十字架》, and you can see the flurry of action and emotion 激烈的动作和情感 surrounding the body of Christ. It's magnificent 宏伟的. +

如果你想在课堂上取得好成绩，并且在五月份的考试中拿到5分，美国大学预修课程欧洲历史的第二单元是非常重要的，你得了解"新教改革"（Protestant Reformation）以及随之而来的"宗教战争"（wars of religion）。你猜怎么着？这正是我要为你复习的内容。所以，如果你准备好获取知识，那我们开始吧。  +

回到**#1054年，基督教会（Christian church）发生了第一次重大分裂，这次分裂产生了罗马天主教会（Roman Catholic Church）和东正教会#（Eastern Orthodox Church）。自那次分裂以来，罗马天主教会在西欧占据主导地位。**你知道，**如果你生活在那个时候，你没有别的选择，只能信仰天主教。**不像现在，你可以去"浸信会"教堂（Baptist church）或者"卫理公会"教堂（Methodist church）之类的。当时你只有一个选择，那就是天主教。顺便说一下，如果你想要这个视频的笔记指南，以及一堆能帮助你学习这个单元和其他所有单元的资料，看看我的美国大学预修课程欧洲历史终极复习资料包，链接在下面的描述里。  +

*到了16世纪，天主教会*（Catholic Church）在政治上卷入了各种事务，并且积累了大量的财富。这些纠葛**导致了腐败。**你需要了解其中的一些情况。**首先是"买卖神职"（simony），也就是买卖教会职位。**我的意思是，比如说，*你会期望大主教（archbishop）这样的教会职位会留给最虔诚、最有经验的人。但事实并非如此，在那个时期，教会职位给了那些有足够金钱买通关系获得职位的人。*  +

**其次是裙带关系（nepotism），也就是任命家人和朋友担任教会职位。**同样，人们获得教会职位不是因为他们有资格，而是因为他们的人际关系。

第三，也是对我们来说最重要的一点，就是**买卖赎罪券**（indulgences）。本质上，这是教会提供的一种方式，**让人们可以购买救赎，或者让他们的亲人免于炼狱。教会为这些行为辩解，**因为，嘿，圣彼得大教堂（Saint Peter's Basilica）不会自己翻新。  +

就在这种腐败的局面中，一位奥古斯丁修道士兼基督教"人文主义者"（Christian humanist）马丁·路德（Martin Luther）出现了。路德的不满始于他研读《新约》（New Testament）中的《罗马书》（book of Romans），*##书中教导说，一个人的救赎, 仅凭信仰的恩典——换句话说，救赎是免费的，由基督自己付出代价。##这当然与教会的立场形成了鲜明对比，教会认为救赎是通过"信仰"和"善行"获得的，更不用说通过购买"赎罪券"来获得救赎了。*  +

**路德还开始相信，《圣经》（scriptures）应该是基督徒的唯一权威，也就是说，不是教皇（pope），也不是复杂的教会教义体系。**此外，**#他还认为，《圣经》并不认可将信徒分为"神圣"和"世俗领域的等级制度"，相反，《圣经》教导"所有信徒皆为祭司"#（priesthood of all believers）。**我希望到现在你能开始体会到马丁·路德所带来的冲击，因为这很有影响力。  +

所以，所有这些, 在1517年10月31日达到了顶峰。路德撰写了一份包含"95条论纲"的文件，批评教会的腐败，并呼吁教会及其领袖进行改革。他把自己的"95条论纲"钉在了维滕贝格（Wittenberg）教堂的门上，事情就这样开始了。公平地说，路德并不打算让这些论纲成为在整个欧洲宣告一种"新的信仰方式"的宣言。这些论纲实际上只是为了在一些受过教育的修道士和牧师中引发讨论。但**由于印刷术（printing press）的出现，95条论纲迅速在神圣罗马帝国（Holy Roman Empire）的德意志诸邦传播开来。**显然，许多其他德国人对天主教会的弊端也有同感，因为路德的论纲被广泛接受。  +

一旦路德的抱怨, 和对《圣经》的新解释, 传到教会官员那里，他们就谴责他为异教徒（heretic），也就是拒绝接受教会公认信仰的人。然后这些官员在沃尔姆斯议会（Diet of Worms）对路德进行审判，要求他撤回自己的观点。路德拒绝撤回，于是他们将他逐出教会（excommunicated）。然后他在他的王子弗雷德里克三世（Frederick III）的保护下躲藏起来，弗雷德里克三世是**众多支持路德的德意志王子之一。这并不是因为他们被路德的作品深深打动，**然后忏悔并乞求路德让他们帮助传播这些改变生活的思想。**#这些王子明白，如果他们支持路德，就会削弱教皇的权力，这意味着德意志王子们反过来会拥有更多权力。#**所以，从很现实的角度来说，我们可以说，路德不是主要的"新教"改革者（Protestant reformer），那些抗议天主教会, 并支持路德工作的王子们才是。  +

如果你了解欧洲历史，你就知道**路德不是第一个批评天主教会的改革者。**在路德之前，像约翰·威克里夫（John Wycliffe）和扬·胡斯（Jan Huss）这样的基督教人文主义者就已经这样做了，他们真正播下了新教改革的种子。所以真正的问题是，为什么是路德的抗议最终导致了教会的分裂呢？嗯，这就要回到印刷术了。*路德是第一个能够使用这种新印刷技术的主要改革者。*  +

在这个时候，印刷厂出版了三种主要类型的出版物：书籍、小册子和大幅传单。路德熟练地利用了这三种出版物，尤其是小册子。到1520年，他的小册子在德国各地，甚至远至英国，大约有30万份。此外，作为一名奥古斯丁修道士，**路德过去用德语（German）向人们布道，而不是拉丁语（Latin），因为他希望普通人能够理解恩典的教义。**因此，由于印刷术的作用，他用德语翻译的《圣经》广泛传播。如果你不知道“vernacular”这个词，它的意思就是人们的通用语言。而这本德语《圣经》以一种方式证实了"新教教义"。例如，*当每个人都能阅读《圣经》时——而不仅仅是牧师和主教——这支持了"所有信徒皆为祭司"的宗教改革教义。*  +

所以**这就是"新教改革"的开端，导致了基督教会的第二次重大分裂。**这一切发生在德意志诸邦，但正如我所说，由于印刷术的作用，宗教改革的思想迅速传播。**宗教改革扎根的下一个重要地方是瑞士，**在一个叫约翰·加尔文（John Calvin）的人的领导下。  +

加尔文最初是马丁·路德的追随者，但两人在救赎教义（doctrine of salvation）的不同解释上产生了分歧。*#加尔文以两项主要的新教神学发展而闻名。① 首先是"预定论"（doctrine of predestination），即上帝在世界创立之前, 就决定了谁会得救，谁不会得救。因此，救赎不是人类选择的问题，而是上帝的选择(取消了人的主观能动性, 完全听天由命了)。② 其次是"选民论"（doctrine of the elect）。那些被上帝选中得救的人, 就是选民，那些真正的选民在这件事上没有选择，而且永远不会失去他们的救赎。#*  +

**一个人怎么知道自己是选民呢？嗯，仅仅因为他们渴望救赎。**此外，如果一个人的救赎导致了善行，那么这个人就是选民。需要明确的是，*#这与天主教教义不同。天主教徒教导说，"信仰"和"善行"(思想和行动都要有)是获得救赎所必需的。加尔文认为，一个人只有通过信仰才能得救，但如果他们是真正的选民，这种救赎自然会导致善行 (所以逻辑就是: 非选民, 即使有善行, 也不会得救)。#*  +

此外，*##加尔文教导说，##财富积累是一个人被选中的标志，不过他也强调，一个人的财富仍然受爱的律法的约束。因此，#一个基督徒有义务用财富来照顾穷人。由于这种教导的直接结果，加尔文在瑞士日内瓦（Geneva）建立了一个福利国家。#*  +

关于**加尔文的日内瓦，**我要说的最后一点是：**教会和国家紧密相连，你真的无法区分它们的界限。#在日内瓦，《圣经》就是法律，这导致了一种"神权政治"（theocracy），也就是一个国家不是由人类统治者统治，而是直接由上帝统治。#**例如，日内瓦的公民依法每周必须去教堂五次。如果你多次被发现逃避礼拜，别担心，他们会把你逐出教会, 或者关进监狱。在加尔文的指导下，**日内瓦的人们不能喝酒、不能跳舞、不能说脏话。**所以，你懂的，日内瓦的情况就是这样。正是通过这些规则，加尔文得以控制日内瓦的民众。*毕竟，加尔文教导说，遵守这些规则的人就是选民，而且每个人都想成为选民，对吧？*  +

加尔文也从印刷术中受益匪浅。他在一本厚厚的名为《基督教要义》（The Institutes of the Christian Church）的书中阐述了他的所有思想。**《基督教要义》是对"宗教改革"教义的第一次完整论述，**印刷术使加尔文的著作得以在整个欧洲传播。它的作用是为"新教教会"提供了所需的教义秩序。**#随着加尔文主义（Calvinism）在欧洲各地传播，在苏格兰产生了"长老会"（Presbyterians），在法国产生了"胡格诺派"（Huguenots），在英国产生了"清教徒"（Puritans）。#**所以加尔文的新教，虽然与路德的教义有着相同的基本原则，但也发展出了自己的特色。  +

在这个时期，*另一个成为独特实体的"新教"团体, 是"再洗礼派"*（Anabaptists），他们相信路德和加尔文的"宗教改革"原则，但在洗礼（baptism）问题上与他们分道扬镳。加尔文和路德教导说, 婴儿可以接受洗礼，在这一点上他们与天主教会一致。而"再洗礼派"认为，洗礼不能在婴儿身上进行，因为这是一种只有成年人才能参与的仪式，因为只有成年人才能真正确认自己是信徒。所以对于再洗礼派来说，给婴儿施洗是不行的。  +

**##"再洗礼派"也反对服兵役。他们相信教会和国家绝对分离——一个人对上帝的全身心承诺, 胜过他们对国家的承诺。##所以他们是和平主义者，**拒绝被征召参加他们国家卷入的战争。  +

说到战争，我刚才谈到的**教会中的许多冲突, 导致了欧洲各国之间的实际武装冲突，我们称之为欧洲的"宗教战争"**（wars of religion）。我们将从这方面谈谈法国和神圣罗马帝国。  +

首先是法国。**在16世纪上半叶，大多数法国人是天主教徒。但到了16世纪，"新教"（Protestantism）获得了重要的立足点，那些接受"新教"的法国人, 被称为"胡格诺派"。事实证明，#将近一半的法国贵族皈依了加尔文主义，并且向王室寻求认可和权利。#**1560年，查理九世（Charles IX）登上王位，但他当时只是个小孩子，只有11岁。因此，他的母亲凯瑟琳·德·美第奇（Catherine de Medici）基本上掌管着这个王国，并且想清除法国的胡格诺派，从而削弱"新教贵族"的权力。记住，这是一种权力手段。如果整个国家在宗教忠诚上是统一的，那么这些忠诚就会与他们的政治忠诚融合，从而建立一个更强大、更有权力的政府。  +

法国的宗教战争始于1562年，**波旁家族（Bourbon family）对"胡格诺派"的大屠杀，**这被称为瓦西大屠杀（Massacre of Vassy），在这次屠杀中，天主教吉斯家族（Catholic Guise family）成员冲进胡格诺派的礼拜仪式，开始不分青红皂白地杀戮。所以情况很糟糕。但在1572年，情况变得更糟，查理九世的妹妹嫁给了也是胡格诺派的纳瓦拉的亨利（Henry of Navarre）。他邀请了许多杰出的胡格诺派人士参加婚礼。而凯瑟琳·德·美第奇，这个狡猾的女人，组织了一场对胡格诺派的大屠杀，这被称为圣巴托洛缪大屠杀（Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre）。随着大屠杀从婚礼现场蔓延开来，大约1万到2万名新教徒被杀。事实证明，亨利的生命得以保全，因为他承诺皈依天主教，他也确实这么做了。  +

随着这些政治和宗教冲突不断酝酿，我们在这一系列冲突中, 又迎来了另一场冲突，那就是始于1587年的**"三亨利战争"**（War of the Three Henrys）。这场战争名字起得很贴切，因为**有三个不同的亨利, 在争夺法国王位。**

- 亨利三世（Henry III）是天主教徒，当时也是国王，并且得到了他母亲凯瑟琳·德·美第奇的支持。他是一个非常不受欢迎的国王——作为一个天主教徒，新教徒不喜欢他，而天主教徒认为他不够虔诚。
- 第二个是纳瓦拉的亨利，他是胡格诺派，也是波旁家族的领袖。你还记得他吧，他的婚礼变成了屠宰场。此外，他娶了亨利三世的妹妹，所以谢天谢地，事情还不算太复杂。
- 第三个是吉斯的亨利（Henry of Guise），他是天主教徒，他想采取措施确保只有天主教徒统治法国。  +

我想告诉你，三个亨利并没有通过互相涂抹鲜奶油, 然后像希腊人那样摔跤, 来解决争端，但让我非常失望的是，亨利三世和吉斯的亨利都被暗杀了，这使得纳瓦拉的亨利登上了王位，他以亨利四世（Henry IV）的身份登上了王位。*作为国王，亨利采取措施实现"宗教宽容"，在1598年颁布了《南特敕令》（Edict of Nantes），正式确立法国为"天主教"国家，同时也为胡格诺派提供了不受骚扰地进行礼拜的自由。*  +

好的，这些就是法国的一些宗教冲突。现在让我们谈谈**"神圣罗马帝国"的冲突。在这里我们要谈谈##三十年战争##**（Thirty Years' War），你可能已经猜到了，这场战争持续了三十年。不管怎样，**#这是"新教改革"的最后一场主要战争。#**为了理解这场战争，你需要了解**#1555年的《奥格斯堡和约》（Peace of Augsburg）。这个和约规定，神圣罗马帝国的各个统治者, 可以自行决定他们的人民是路德派（Lutheran）还是天主教徒。#**神圣罗马帝国皇帝查理五世（Charles V）通过《奥格斯堡和约》，原因和亨利四世颁布《南特敕令》大致相同——也就是结束国家的宗教纷争，维护国家的权力。  +

好的，等等。如果你不了解"神圣罗马帝国"，这些内容可能没有什么意义。*##法国是一个统一的国家，而"神圣罗马帝国"由数百个松散结盟的邦国组成，每个邦国都有各自的统治者。这些统治者要对"神圣罗马帝国皇帝"负责，但他们自己也拥有很大的权力。##所以《奥格斯堡和约》规定，各个独立邦国的统治者, 可以自行决定他们的人民, 是天主教徒还是路德派。*  +

如果你一直在认真听，**#你肯定注意到了，我还没有提到《奥格斯堡和约》给"加尔文主义者"（Calvinists）信仰以任何余地，你是对的。当时的宗教宽容选择, 只有"路德派"或"天主教徒"。#**所以在1618年，一个叫弗雷德里克一世（Frederick the First）的加尔文主义领袖, 挑战了神圣罗马帝国皇帝斐迪南二世（Ferdinand II）的天主教专制统治。女士们，先生们，宗教战争就是这样开始的。  +

**斐迪南(神圣罗马帝国皇帝)关闭了波希米亚（Bohemia）地区的路德派教堂，违反了《奥格斯堡和约》。不出所料，这让新教徒非常愤怒。**所以他们抓住斐迪南的官员，把他们抬到布拉格（Prague）城堡的楼梯上，然后直接把他们扔出窗外。这个事件被称为"布拉格掷出窗外事件"（Defenestration of Prague）——“defenestration”是一个很华丽的词，意思是把人扔出窗外。不管怎样，这个故事有趣的部分是，斐迪南的官员实际上在掷出窗外事件中幸存了下来，只是因为一大堆粪便缓冲了他们的坠落。所以还挺有意思的。  +

不管怎样，**这个事件引发了"三十年战争"。**基本上，这场战争有四个阶段，我会简要解释每个阶段。第一个阶段是波希米亚阶段，从1618年持续到1625年，之所以这么叫，是因为这只是波希米亚地区新教联盟（Protestant Union）和天主教联盟（Catholic League）之间的一场小规模局部战争。神圣罗马帝国皇帝斐迪南二世在白山战役（Battle of White Mountain）中击败了新教的弗雷德里克一世，在许多德意志邦国重新确立了天主教的地位。  +

第二个阶段是丹麦阶段，从1625年持续到1630年。之所以叫丹麦阶段，是因为**丹麦的新教国王参与了这场战争，并对天主教徒发动了攻击。**需要注意的是，**#这场战争, 从局部冲突, 转变为跨国战争(国际战争)。#**最终，丹麦国王被击败，这导致了第三个阶段，瑞典阶段，从1630年持续到1635年。**#这标志着战争超出了神圣罗马帝国的边界，变成了一场真正的欧洲战争。#**瑞典国王古斯塔夫·阿道夫（Gustavus Adolphus）组织了"新教"事业，作为一名杰出的战略家，他为新教徒取得了一些重大胜利。  +

在这里我要告诉你，**在这个阶段，新教事业得到了一个叫黎塞留枢机主教（Cardinal Richelieu）的人的大量资助。等一下，##为什么天主教的法国, 会帮助"新教"事业呢？##嗯，#这表明三十年战争从一场纯粹的宗教冲突#——尽管这一点也有争议——#演变成了一场更具政治性的冲突。统治西班牙和神圣罗马帝国的"哈布斯堡家族"（Habsburgs），而法国人，#**以防你不知道，**#讨厌哈布斯堡家族，并寻找任何机会削弱他们的权力。#**而德国和瑞典的新教徒正在这么做。所以，你懂的，让我们站在新教徒这边。  +

最后，我们来到了第四个阶段，也就是法国阶段，从1635年持续到1648年。法**国不再只是给新教徒送去大量的烈酒，而是直接参战，站在了"新教徒"这边。同样，法国人几乎不在乎神圣罗马帝国的"新教"或"天主教"问题如何解决。他们实际上利用这场战争作为借口，与西班牙的"哈布斯堡家族"作战，以确保他们不会从新教的失败中恢复过来。**  +

**#战争终于结束了，一切在1648年的《威斯特伐利亚和约（Peace of Westphalia）中得到了解决。#**你可能会想：“哦，真有意思，这和这个时期结束是同一年。” 是的，因为**《威斯特伐利亚和约》意义重大，**你真的需要了解它。*#《威斯特伐利亚和约》结束了"三十年战争"，标志着欧洲历史的一个转折点，因为 ① 它有效地结束了欧洲所有的"宗教战争"。它修订了《奥格斯堡和约》，将"加尔文主义"列为合法的信仰，② 并且使"神圣罗马帝国"皇帝的权力变弱，各邦国统治者的权力变强，从而加速了"神圣罗马帝国"的衰落。③ 此外，它正式标志着中世纪"普世基督教世界观念"的终结。在这之后，很明显教会永远地分裂了。#*

而且你知道，说到教会的分裂，现在让我们回到天主教会。基本上，**在欧洲人在"宗教战争"中相互残杀的整个时期，天主教会也在进行着自身的改革，**这被称为"天主教改革"（Catholic Reformation），或者你可能听过**它被称为"反宗教改革"**（Counter-Reformation）。为了回应像马丁·路德（Martin Luther）和约翰·加尔文（John Calvin）对教会提出的批评，天主教领袖决定整顿教会。  +

现在我可能还需要提到，天主教徒进行自我改革的原因有很多。是的，他们是在回应"新教改革者"的意识形态批评，但他们也寻求自我改革，因为他们正有很多人转投"新教"阵营。所以你也可以说，天主教徒进行自我改革, 是为了维护他们在民众中的权力和影响力。  +

不管怎样，教皇保罗三世（Pope Paul III）*建立了"罗马宗教裁判所"（Roman Inquisition），它有权逮捕和处决异教徒*。这是不是有点马基雅维利主义（Machiavellian）的味道呢？注意其中的联系，伙计。教会正在尽一切可能维护权力，包括使用恐惧和恐吓手段。此外，*教会还制定了《禁书目录》*（Index of Prohibited Books），这是一份包含宣扬异端教义书籍的清单，其中包括基督教人文主义者伊拉斯谟（Erasmus）, 以及一些新教改革者的作品。  +

但毫无疑问，*天主教改革中最重要的事件, 是特伦托会议*（Council of Trent），它在1545年至1563年间断断续续地召开。它的目的是改革天主教会，并与新教徒达成某种和解。**该会议在改革教会方面取得了一些成果，但在与新教徒和解方面基本上毫无进展。**所以在会议上，教会开始整顿一些导致"新教徒"极度不满的腐败行为。它抑制了"买卖神职"（simony），并禁止买卖"赎罪券"（indulgences）。此外，会议重申了神职人员的"独身制度"（celibacy of the clergy）。可以说，中世纪的牧师在这方面有点随意。*随着这些腐败现象被清除，天主教会在"特伦托会议"所确立的基础上, 经历了一次精神复兴，这种复兴一直持续到20世纪中叶。*  +

**现在会议还重申了一些经典的天主教教义，**比如"圣体圣事"（transubstantiation）、教皇和《圣经》（scriptures）的平等权威、七大圣礼（seven sacraments）等等。*所以这样一来，与新教徒的和解就不可能了。在重申这些教义的过程中，会议永久性地巩固了基督教内部的分裂。*  +

不管怎样，天主教会自身继续经历着复兴，这种复兴的表现之一, 就是建立了新的"宗教修会"。

- 阿维拉的圣特蕾莎（Saint Theresa of Avila）建立了"加尔默罗会"（Carmelite order），她创立了许多女修道院，并使该修会回归到一种更严格的信仰形式，强调苦行（asceticism）和贫穷。
- *可能最重要的新修会是"耶稣会"*（Jesuits）。它由依纳爵·罗耀拉（Ignatius of Loyola）创立，**目的是进行精神复兴，该修会的成员发誓安贫守贞，他们建立了学校，并开展了广泛的传教活动。正是耶稣会将天主教传播到了印度、日本、巴西和北美洲、非洲。**但他们也将传教精力集中在国内，通过他们的工作，神圣罗马帝国（Holy Roman Empire）的许多南部省份, 重新皈依了天主教。  +

好的，现在让我们换个角度，自下而上地看看这个时期。到目前为止，我们谈论了很多重要人物和统治者，但现在让我们谈谈普通民众。我认为我们应该从"社会等级制度"（social hierarchy）开始说起。"社会等级制度"在农村和城市环境中，从阶级、宗教和性别等方面, 定义了一个人的社会地位。  +

*在这个时期之前，一个人的阶级, 是由其出生时的财富和家庭决定的。但随着商人精英（merchant elite）的崛起，其中一些人变得非常富有，向上流动成为了一种可能，也就是说阶级地位不再一定与土地或出身家庭相关。即便如此，"土地所有权"仍然很有威望。例如，#在英国议会（English Parliament）中，上议院（House of Lords）是为"拥有土地的公民"保留的，而下议院（House of Commons）是为那些"没有土地的人"保留的，即使其中一些人非常富有。#*  +

说到宗教，一个人的信仰, 在社会地位方面当然很重要。回想一下，如果你在天主教的法国是胡格诺派（Huguenot），你很有可能在一场婚礼上被屠杀。此外，西班牙王位（Spanish throne）极力将犹太人（Jews）驱逐出他们的土地。所以是的，如果你想在欧洲过上好日子，你需要信仰正确的宗教。  +

就性别而言，父权制（patriarchy）是当时的社会秩序，这意味着这是一个男性主导的社会。女性被期望服从她们的丈夫和父亲，她们的收入属于她们生活中的男性。所以听到女性在很大程度上被排除在欧洲的经济和政治生活之外，你不应该感到惊讶。这与欧洲各国的整个政治结构有关。例如，英国的查理一世（Charles the First of England）将自己视为国家的父亲，只有家庭等级制度得以维持，他自己的权威才能得以维持。  +

现在, **这种标准(女的从属于男的)在城市富裕家庭中表现得更为明显，在这些家庭中，他们有更多的自由来管理家庭。在农村家庭中，男性和女性相对更加平等，尽管在某些角色上他们各自有不同的工作领域。**不管怎样，城市和农村家庭都围绕核心家庭（nuclear family）而不是大家庭（extended family）来组织。  +

**事实上，文艺复兴（Renaissance）和宗教改革（Reformation）引发了关于"父权制结构"以及"女性在社会中适当角色"的争论。**在法国知识分子中，他们争论的是所谓的“女性问题”（querelle des femmes），翻译过来就是“女性问题”。主要是关于女性是否适合接受大学教育的争论。一方面，人们认为女性不适合，因为女性天生不如男性。他们怎么知道的呢？嗯，难道不是夏娃（Eve）被蛇诱惑，从而导致整个人类陷入罪恶和痛苦之中的吗？而争论的**另一方则认为：如果女性低人一等，那只是因为男性不让她们接受教育。毕竟，看看英国的伊丽莎白女王**（Queen Elizabeth）——她受过教育，并且像个领导者一样统治国家。  +

**在天主教会中，女性当然不能成为牧师，而且不能拥有凌驾于男性之上的权威职位。但她们可以成为修女（nuns），**这也算一种选择。在女修道院的环境中，修女有机会在女性群体中发挥她们的艺术、医学或领导才能。  +

**在新教方面，**路德（Luther）和加尔文（Calvin）都教导说，妻子应该服从丈夫，并将自己展示为顺从和慈善的典范。但**#只有"再洗礼派"（Anabaptists）给予女性权威职位，其中一些女性甚至成为了传教士#**（preachers）。在这个时期殉道的所有"再洗礼派"教徒中，近三分之一是担任领导职务的女性。  +

在这个时期，随着许多人从农村搬到城市，并且**由于"宗教改革"对宗教权威提出了更大的挑战，城市政府承担起了"制定法律来规范公共道德"的任务，而这些任务以前是由教会来完成的。**例如，在这个时期，许多市政当局将卖淫（prostitution）定为非法行为。新教徒认为婚姻是"解决性欲"的唯一合法途径。因此，他们努力让地方政府通过法律关闭和禁止妓院。  +

在一些地方，当局试图限制每年"狂欢节"（Carnival）庆祝活动中的狂欢行为。*##自中世纪以来，"狂欢节"是在"大斋期"（Lent）之前举行的节日，在狂欢节期间，人们会尽情狂欢。他们喝醉，连续几天跳舞，装扮成国王、教皇等权威人物，所以在那几天里，社会秩序有点颠倒。##但由于"大斋期"的天主教忏悔教义，一些新教领袖试图制定法律, 限制狂欢节的过度行为。然而，在远离国家管控的农村地区，人们仍然坚持以这种方式庆祝。*  +

为了让每个人都遵守规定，地方和教会当局采用了一些公开惩罚和羞辱措施，以防止民众违反某些法律和社会规范。如果你违法了，你可能会被关进"颈手枷"（stocks），你的头、手臂和脚会被限制在木块中。但别担心，"颈手枷"通常设置在城镇中心，这样任何路人都可以向囚犯投掷腐烂的食物和垃圾。此外，还有用藤条或鞭子鞭笞的惩罚，有时在被关进"颈手枷"之前就会被鞭笞。所以，那可真是糟糕的一天。  +

即便如此，*随着"资本主义"（capitalism）的兴起*——我们将在下一单元详细讨论——一种新的休闲文化正在兴起。在他们的空闲时间里，人们开始大量参加像拳击、斗牛或骑士比武这样的血腥运动。此外，根据教会日历，圣徒纪念日（saints' days）的庆祝活动吸引了大量人群。例如，*诸圣节（All Saints' Day）是一个庆祝"所有已故圣徒"的节日。他们坚信得胜教会（那些已经升入天堂的人）和战斗教会（那些仍生活在地球上的人）之间, 存在着神秘的联系。*  +

关于这个时期的社会，我要说的最后一点是：即使发生了所有这些宗教和政治动荡，许多人仍然坚持世代相传的民间观念。与此相关的是**16和17世纪的巫术热潮。对这个时期的天主教和新教领袖来说，巫术是与魔鬼达成契约的证据，**因此应该被恐惧和消灭。在科学出现之前，许多常见的疾病或不幸事件都被归咎于女巫。**人们越来越相信女巫与魔鬼勾结，企图推翻基督教。**所以随着风险越来越高，猎巫行动拉开了帷幕。  +

历史学家估计，在16和17世纪，大约有4万到6万人因巫术被处决，其中大多数是女性。这又让我们回到了"女性低人一等"的观念上。*人们认为女性在道德上不如男性坚强，因此更容易与魔鬼达成协议。四分之三的处决发生在神圣罗马帝国（Holy Roman Empire）。为什么会这样呢？嗯，很难确切知道原因，但想想看：新教改革（Protestant Reformation）始于神圣罗马帝国，这导致了严重的社会动荡。此外，这些人在"三十年战争"（Thirty Years' War）期间经历了大量的破坏和死亡。所以可能是这些人试图通过将女性当作女巫来替罪，从而重新掌控自己的生活。*  +

好的，现在我们在这个单元要做的最后一件事是谈谈艺术。**风格主义（Mannerism）在文艺复兴时期发展起来，这是一种艺术形式，艺术家们利用扭曲的人物形象、发达的肌肉和鲜艳的色彩, 来传达深刻的情感和戏剧性。**风格主义的一个很好的例子是米开朗基罗（Michelangelo）在西斯廷教堂（Sistine Chapel）的《最后的审判》（The Last Judgment）。我的意思是，如果你想要戏剧性，这里全都有。这是审判日，在这里你可以看到被诅咒的人处境悲惨，而圣徒们则升入极乐世界。  +

**但在这个时期，艺术领域还发展出了一种新的创新，叫做##"巴洛克风格"（Baroque）。它形式奢华，风格华丽且细节丰富，##充满情感和戏剧性。**它始于天主教改革时期的罗马（Rome）。*随着教会的复兴，他们试图吸引民众，并说服他们重新对教会充满信心。正是这种华丽和戏剧性的风格，##天主教徒试图以此来批评"新教艺术"常常显得贫瘠和单调的风格。##它也是财富和权力的象征，大教堂越华丽、规模越大，就越能反映出天主教教会在这个时期极力维护的权力。*  +

巴洛克风格（Baroque style）中最伟大的艺术家可能是彼得·保罗·鲁本斯（Peter Paul Rubens）。看看这幅画《基督被抬上十字架》（The Elevation of the Cross），你可以看到围绕着基督身体的激烈动作和情感表达。这非常壮观。  +

Unit two of the AP European History curriculum is so important to understand if you want an A in your class and a five on your exam in May. You have to know what happened in the Protestant Reformation and the wars of religion that follow. And guess what? That's exactly what I'm about to review for you. So if you're ready to get that brain cows milked, let's get to it.

Now back in 1054, we had the first major split of the Christian church, and that split gave us the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Since that split, it was the Roman Catholic Church that dominated Western Europe. You know, if you were alive back then, you didn't like the Catholic Church. It's not like you could have gone down the street to the Baptist church or the Methodist church or whatever. You had one option, and that option was Catholic. By the way, if you want note guides for this video and a bunch of other stuff to help you with this unit and all the other units, check out my AP European History Ultimate Review Packet, which is linked in the description below.

Now by the 1500s, the Catholic Church had gotten itself all kinds of tangled up in politics, and it accumulated a metric butt load of wealth. And some of those entanglements led to corruption. You need to know a few of these. First was simony, which was the buying and selling of church offices. I mean, you would expect that the church office of archbishop, for example, would be reserved for the most pious, most experienced man. But no, in this period, church offices went to the guy who had the requisite amount of boom boom to buy his way into the office.

Second was nepotism, which meant the appointing of family and friends to church offices. Again, people got church offices not because they were qualified but because of who they were related to. Third, and maybe most important for our purposes, was the buying and selling of indulgences. Essentially, this was the church offering a way for people to buy their salvation or maybe buy loved ones out of purgatory. And the church justified these kind of behaviors because hey, Saint Peter's Basilica ain't going to renovate itself.

Now right into this nasty soup of corruption came an Augustinian monk and Christian humanist named Martin Luther. His grievances began when Luther was studying the book of Romans in the New Testament, which taught that a person's salvation was by grace alone through faith -- or to put it another way, salvation is free, paid for by Christ himself. This of course sharply contrasted with the church's position that salvation was earned by faith and good works, not to mention buying it through indulgences.

Now Luther also came to believe that the scriptures alone ought to be the sole authority of Christians, which is to say not the pope and not the elaborate system of church dogma. Furthermore, he also saw that the scriptures did not endorse the hierarchy of believers into sacred and secular realms, but instead the scriptures taught the priesthood of all believers. I hope by now you can start to taste the sauce that Martin Luther was cooking up, because it was spicy.

And so all of this came to a head on October 31, 1517. Luther composed a document containing 95 theses criticizing the corruption of the church and calling the church and its leaders to reform. He nailed his 95 theses to the Wittenberg church door, and it was on like Donkey Kong. Now to be fair, Luther didn't intend these theses to be a broad proclamation throughout all of Europe for a new way to believe. It was really only meant to spark a discussion among a few educated monks and priests. But because of the printing press, the 95 theses were spread throughout the German states of the Holy Roman Empire with great speed. And apparently many other Germans felt the same way about the Catholic Church's abuses because Luther's theses were widely embraced.

Now once Luther's complaints and new interpretations of the scriptures made it to the church officials, they went ahead and denounced him as a heretic, which is a person who rejects the accepted beliefs of the church. Now those officials went ahead and put Luther on trial at the Diet of Worms, at which they demanded Luther's recantation. Luther refused to recant, and so they excommunicated him. He then went into hiding under the protection of his prince, Frederick III, who is one of the many German princes who supported Luther. That's not because they were moved deeply by his writings and repented in dust and ashes and begged Luther to let them help spread these life-changing ideas.

Now these princes understood that if they supported Luther, that would weaken the pope's power, and that means German princes would in turn have more power. So in a very real way, we can say that Luther wasn't the chief Protestant reformer but rather the princes who protested the Catholic Church and supported Luther's work.

Now if you know your European history, you know that Luther was not the first reformer to criticize the Catholic Church. He had Christian humanists like John Wycliffe and Jan Huss who did it before Luther and really planted the seeds of the Protestant Reformation. So the real question is why was it Luther's protest that ultimately split the church? Well, that brings us back to the printing press. Luther was the first major reformer to have access to this new printing technology.

And by this point, there were three major kinds of publications coming out of the printing houses: books, pamphlets, and broadsides. And Luther made proficient use of all three but especially pamphlets. By 1520, there was something like 300,000 copies of his pamphlets all across Germany and as far away as England. Furthermore, as an Augustinian monk, Luther used to preach to the people in German, not Latin, because you know he wanted ordinary people to understand the doctrines of grace. Therefore, his production of a vernacular Bible in German spread far and wide thanks to the printing press. If you don't know the word vernacular, it just means the common language of the people. And that German Bible had a way of confirming Protestant doctrine. For example, when everyone could read a book like the Bible -- not just priests and bishops -- it gave support to the Reformation doctrine of the priesthood of all believers.

So that was how the Protestant Reformation began, leading to the second major split in the Christian church. So that was happening in the German states, but as I said, thanks to the printing press, the ideas of the Reformation spread quickly. And the next significant place the Reformation took root was Switzerland under the leadership of a guy named John Calvin.

Now Calvin was originally a follower of Martin Luther, but the two split over varying interpretations of the doctrine of salvation. Now Calvin was known for two major Protestant theological developments. First was the doctrine of predestination, which said that God had from before the foundation of the world decided who would be saved and who would not. Therefore, salvation was not a matter of human choice but God's choice. Second was the doctrine of the elect. Those whom God had chosen to save were the elect, and those who were truly elect had no choice in the matter and further could never lose their salvation.

Now how did a person know he or she was a member of the elect? Well, simply because they desired salvation. Furthermore, a person was elect if their salvation led to good works. And to be clear, this was different from the Catholic doctrine. Catholics taught that faith and good works were necessary for salvation. Calvin argued that only by faith was a person saved, but if they were truly elect, that salvation would naturally result in good works.

Additionally, Calvin taught that wealth accumulation would be a sign of a person's election, although he tempered that by teaching that a person's wealth was still governed by the law of love. A Christian therefore had an obligation to use wealth to care for the poor. And as a direct result of this teaching, Calvin set up a welfare state in Geneva.

Now the last thing I'll say about Calvin's Geneva is this: the church and the state were so tightly tied together that you really couldn't tell where one started and the other ended. In Geneva, the Bible was the law, and this resulted in a kind of theocracy, which is when a state is ruled not by a human ruler but directly by God. For example, citizens of Geneva were required by law to attend church five days a week. And if you were caught skipping those services enough times, don't worry, they would just excommunicate you or put you in jail. Under Calvin's direction in Geneva, the people couldn't drink, couldn't dance, couldn't swear. So you know, all good in Geneva. It was by these rules that Calvin was able to control the population in Geneva. After all, Calvin taught that it was the elect who obeyed such rules, and everyone wanted to be part of the elect, right?

Now Calvin also benefited tremendously from the printing press as well. He laid down all of his ideas in a hefty volume called The Institutes of the Christian Religion. The Institutes was the first complete treatment of Reformation doctrines, and the printing press enabled Calvin's work to spread throughout Europe. And what it did was to provide the needed doctrinal order to Protestant churches. As Calvinism spread throughout Europe, it created the Presbyterians in Scotland, the Huguenots in France, and the Puritans in England. So Calvin's Protestantism, while it held to the same basic principles as Luther's doctrine, developed its own distinctives.

Now another Protestant group that became a distinct entity during this time was the Anabaptists, who believed in the Reformation principles that Luther and Calvin did but they separated from them on the question of baptism. Calvin and Luther taught that infants could be baptized, and on this they agreed with the Catholic Church. And the Baptists, on the other hand, believed that baptism could not be performed on infants on account of it was a rite that only adults could participate in, because only adults could truly affirm that they were believers. So for Anabaptists, the baby dunking was out.

Also out for the Anabaptists was military service. They believed in the absolute separation between church and state -- that a person's commitment to God wholesale trumped their commitment to the state. So they were pacifists and refused to be conscripted for the wars that their states got themselves into.

And speaking of wars, many of these conflicts in the church that I've just been talking about led to actual armed conflicts between European states, and we call those Europe's wars of religion. We'll talk about France and the Holy Roman Empire in this respect.

First, France. In the first half of the 1500s, most French people were Catholic. But by the 1500s, Protestantism had gained a significant foothold, and those French folks who embraced Protestantism were known as the Huguenots. As it turned out, nearly half of the French nobles had converted to Calvinism and were seeking recognition and rights from the crown. In 1560, Charles IX took the throne, but he was a wee little thing coming in at only 11 years old. Therefore, his mother, Catherine de Medici, was basically running the kingdom and wanted to purge France of the Huguenots and therefore to diminish the power of the Protestant nobles. And remember, that's a power move. If the whole country was singular in its religious allegiance, then those loyalties would merge with their political allegiance, and that would create a stronger, more powerful government.

Now the French wars of religion began with a massacre of Huguenots led by the Bourbon family in 1562 known as the Massacre of Vassy, in which members of the Catholic Guise family stormed their worship service and began killing them indiscriminately. So that was rough. But it got even worse in 1572 when Charles the Ninth's sister married Bourbon Henry of Navarre, who was also a Huguenot. And he invited many prominent Huguenots to the wedding. And Catherine de Medici, crafty lady that she was, organized a massacre of the Huguenots that became known as the Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre. And as the massacre spread beyond the wedding, something like 10 to 20,000 Protestants were killed. As it turns out, Henry's life was spared because he promised he would convert to Catholicism, which he did.

And as these political and religious conflicts continued to simmer, we got yet another conflict in this series, which was called the War of the Three Henrys starting in 1587. This very appropriately named war broke out because three different Henrys were vying for the French throne. There was Henry III, who was a Catholic and who also happened to be the king at that time and had the support of his mother Catherine de Medici. He was a deeply unpopular king -- like as a Catholic, Protestants didn't like him, and the Catholics thought he wasn't Catholic enough. Second, there was Henry of Navarre, who was a Huguenot and leader of the Bourbon family. And you'll remember him as the guy whose wedding turned into a slaughterhouse. Additionally, he was married to Henry the Third's sister, so thankfully this isn't even getting complicated. And third, there was Henry of Guise, who was a Catholic, and he wanted to take measures to make sure that only Catholics ruled France.

Now I'd like to tell you that the three Henrys resolved this dispute by slathering themselves with whipped cream and wrestling it out Greek style, but to my great disappointment, both Henry III and Henry of Guise got themselves assassinated, and that left Henry of Navarre to take the throne, which he did under the name of Henry IV. And as king, Henry took steps towards religious toleration by issuing the Edict of Nantes in 1598, which officially established France as Catholic while also providing freedom for Huguenots to worship without harassment.

Okay, so those are a few of the religious conflicts in France. Now let's talk about the conflicts in the Holy Roman Empire. And here we're going to talk about the Thirty Years' War, which in case you couldn't tell lasted for, you know, thirty years. Anyway, this was the last major war of the Protestant Reformation. In order to get this one, you need to know about the Peace of Augsburg in 1555. Now this established that individual rulers in the Holy Roman Empire could decide for themselves whether their people would be Lutheran or Catholic. The Holy Roman Emperor Charles V passed the Peace of Augsburg for much the same reason that Henry IV enacted the Edict of Nantes -- namely to end the state's religious squabbles and maintain the power of the state.

Okay, hold on. Now that's not going to make any sense to you unless you understand what the Holy Roman Empire was. While France was one unified state, the Holy Roman Empire was made up of hundreds of loosely confederated states which had individual rulers. Now those rulers were answerable to the Holy Roman Emperor, but they had a great deal of power by themselves. So the Peace of Augsburg said that each of those leaders of the independent states could decide for themselves whether their people would be Catholic or Lutheran.

Now if you've been listening closely, you have no doubt noticed that I haven't said anything about the Peace of Augsburg giving any latitude to Calvinists, and you would be right. The options were Lutheran or Catholic. So in 1618, a Calvinist leader named Frederick the First challenged the Catholic absolutism of the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how you get a religious war.

Ferdinand broke the Peace of Augsburg by shutting down the Lutheran churches in the Bohemia region. Now not surprisingly, this got the Protestants pretty angry. So they grabbed Ferdinand's officials, carried them up the stairs of the castle in Prague, and summarily threw them out the window. This event became known as the Defenestration of Prague -- defenestration being a fancy word for throwing someone out a window. Anyway, the juicy part of the story is that Ferdinand's officials actually survived the defenestration, but only because a giant pile of poo broke their fall. So that's fun.

Anyway, that event sparked the Thirty Years' War. And basically, there were four phases to this war, and I'll explain each of them briefly. First was the Bohemian phase, which lasted from 1618 to 1625, and it's called this because it was just a small localized war in Bohemia between the Protestant Union and the Catholic League. The Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II defeated Protestant Frederick the First at the Battle of White Mountain and re-established Catholicism in many German states.

Second, there was the Danish phase, which lasted from 1625 to 1630. It's called the Danish phase because the king of Denmark, who was Protestant, got in on the action and led attacks against the Catholics. And it's important to notice here that the war is transforming now from a localized conflict into a transnational war. Now ultimately, the king of Denmark was defeated, and that led to the third phase, the Swedish phase, which lasted from 1630 to 1635. This marks the point at which the war extended beyond the borders of the Holy Roman Empire and became a proper European war. King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden organized the Protestant cause and as a brilliant strategist scored some major victories for the Protestants.

Now here's where I tell you that during this phase, a metric buttload of funding for the Protestant cause came from a guy named Cardinal Richelieu of France. Wait a second, why in the fresh heck is Catholic France helping the Protestant cause? Well, it's an indication that the Thirty Years' War is evolving from a purely religious conflict -- although even that is debatable -- to a more political conflict. So was the Habsburgs who ruled Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, and the French, in case you don't know, loathed the Habsburgs and sought any chance to diminish their power. And here were German and Swedish Protestants doing just that. So you know, let's jump in on the Protestant side.

And then finally, you get the fourth phase, which is known as the French phase, and it lasted from 1635 to 1648. Instead of just sending cartloads of hooch over to the Protestants, France went ahead and entered the war on their side. And again, the French cared almost none whether the Protestant or Catholic question was settled in the Holy Roman Empire. They actually used this war as an excuse to fight the Habsburgs in Spain in order to assure that they would not rebound from the Protestant defeats.

Now the war was finally over, and everything got settled at the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. And you're like, "Oh, well isn't that interesting? That's the same year this time period ends." Yeah, that's because Westphalia was a big deal, and you really need to know it. So the Peace of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years' War and marked a turning point in European history because it effectively marked the end of all of Europe's religious wars. It amended the Augsburg agreement to include Calvinism as legitimate faith, and it kept the Holy Roman Emperor weak and the rulers of individual states strong, and thus hastened the decline of the Holy Roman Empire. Additionally, it officially marked the end of the medieval idea of universal Christendom. After this, it was clear that the church was forever divided.

And as these political 政治的；政权的 and religious 宗教的；虔诚的 conflicts 冲突；争执 continued to simmer 酝酿；即将爆发, we got yet another conflict in this series, which was called the War of the Three Henrys starting in 1587. This very appropriately named war broke out because three different Henrys were vying 竞争；争夺 for the French throne 王座；王权. There was Henry III, who was a Catholic 天主教的 and who also happened to be the king at that time and had the support of his mother Catherine de Medici. He was a deeply unpopular king -- like as a Catholic, Protestants 新教徒 didn't like him, and the Catholics thought he wasn't Catholic enough. Second, there was Henry of Navarre, who was a Huguenot 胡格诺派（法国加尔文派 Protestant） and leader of the Bourbon 波旁家族 family. And you'll remember him as the guy whose wedding turned into a slaughterhouse 屠宰场；大屠杀场所. Additionally, he was married to Henry the Third's sister, so thankfully this isn't even getting complicated. And third, there was Henry of Guise, who was a Catholic, and he wanted to take measures 采取措施 to make sure that only Catholics ruled France.

Now I'd like to tell you that the three Henrys resolved this dispute 争端；争执 by slathering 厚厚地涂抹 themselves with whipped cream 生奶油 and wrestling 摔跤；搏斗 it out Greek style, but to my great disappointment, both Henry III and Henry of Guise got themselves assassinated 暗杀, and that left Henry of Navarre to take the throne, which he did under the name of Henry IV. And as king, Henry took steps 采取措施 towards religious toleration 宗教宽容 by issuing 颁布 the Edict of Nantes 南特敕令 in 1598, which officially established France as Catholic while also providing freedom for Huguenots to worship 崇拜；礼拜 without harassment 骚扰；侵扰.

Okay, so those are a few of the religious conflicts in France. Now let's talk about the conflicts in the Holy Roman Empire 神圣罗马帝国. And here we're going to talk about the Thirty Years' War 三十年战争, which in case you couldn't tell lasted for, you know, thirty years. Anyway, this was the last major war of the Protestant Reformation 新教改革. In order to get this one, you need to know about the Peace of Augsburg 奥格斯堡和约 in 1555. Now this established that individual rulers in the Holy Roman Empire could decide for themselves whether their people would be Lutheran 路德教的 or Catholic. The Holy Roman Emperor Charles V passed the Peace of Augsburg for much the same reason that Henry IV enacted 颁布 the Edict of Nantes -- namely to end the state's religious squabbles 口角；小争执 and maintain the power of the state.

Okay, hold on. Now that's not going to make any sense to you unless you understand what the Holy Roman Empire was. While France was one unified state, the Holy Roman Empire was made up of hundreds of loosely confederated 结成同盟的 states which had individual rulers. Now those rulers were answerable to 对...负责 the Holy Roman Emperor, but they had a great deal of 大量的 power by themselves. So the Peace of Augsburg said that each of those leaders of the independent states could decide for themselves whether their people would be Catholic or Lutheran.

Now if you've been listening closely, you have no doubt noticed that I haven't said anything about the Peace of Augsburg giving any latitude 自由；回旋余地 to Calvinists 加尔文派教徒, and you would be right. The options were Lutheran or Catholic. So in 1618, a Calvinist leader named Frederick the First challenged the Catholic absolutism 专制主义；绝对主义 of the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how you get a religious war.

Ferdinand broke the Peace of Augsburg by shutting down 关闭 the Lutheran churches in the Bohemia 波希米亚 region. Now not surprisingly, this got the Protestants pretty angry. So they grabbed Ferdinand's officials, carried them up the stairs of the castle in Prague 布拉格, and summarily 即刻地；仓促地 threw them out the window. This event became known as the Defenestration of Prague 布拉格抛窗事件 -- defenestration 抛窗 being a fancy word for throwing someone out a window. Anyway, the juicy 有趣的；生动的 part of the story is that Ferdinand's officials actually survived the defenestration, but only because a giant pile of poo 粪便 broke their fall. So that's fun.

Anyway, that event sparked 引发 the Thirty Years' War. And basically, there were four phases 阶段 to this war, and I'll explain each of them briefly.

It's called the Danish phase because the king of Denmark, who was Protestant, got in on the action 参与 and led attacks against the Catholics. And it's important to notice here that the war is transforming now from a localized conflict into a transnational 跨国的 war. Now ultimately, the king of Denmark was defeated, and that led to the third phase, the Swedish phase, which lasted from 1630 to 1635.

Well, it's an indication 迹象 that the Thirty Years' War is evolving from a purely religious conflict -- although even that is debatable 有争议的 -- to a more political conflict. So was the Habsburgs 哈布斯堡王朝 who ruled Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, and the French, in case you don't know, loathed 厌恶 the Habsburgs and sought any chance to diminish 削弱 their power. And here were German and Swedish Protestants doing just that. So you know, let's jump in on 加入 the Protestant side.

And again, the French cared almost none whether the Protestant or Catholic question was settled in the Holy Roman Empire. They actually used this war as an excuse 借口 to fight the Habsburgs in Spain in order to assure 确保 that they would not rebound 反弹 from the Protestant defeats.

Now the war was finally over, and everything got settled at the Peace of Westphalia 威斯特伐利亚和约 in 1648. And you're like, "Oh, well isn't that interesting? That's the same year this time period ends." Yeah, that's because Westphalia was a big deal 重要事件, and you really need to know it. So the Peace of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years' War and marked a turning point 转折点 in European history because it effectively marked the end of all of Europe's religious wars. It amended 修订 the Augsburg agreement to include Calvinism as legitimate 合法的；正当的 faith, and it kept the Holy Roman Emperor weak and the rulers of individual states strong, and thus hastened 加速 the decline 衰落 of the Holy Roman Empire. Additionally, it officially marked the end of the medieval 中世纪的 idea of universal Christendom 基督教世界. After this, it was clear that the church was forever divided.







And you know, speaking of the church being divided, let's return to the Catholic Church now. Basically, the whole time that Europeans were slaughtering each other during the religious wars, the Catholic Church was undergoing a reformation of its own known as the Catholic Reformation, or you might hear it called the Counter-Reformation. In response to the criticisms leveled at the church from the likes of Martin Luther and John Calvin, Catholic leaders decided to clean up their house.

Now I should probably also mention that the Catholics started reforming themselves for a number of reasons. Yes, they were responding to the ideological criticism of the Protestant reformers, but they also sought to reform themselves because they were losing lots of people to the Protestant side. So you could equally argue that the Catholics reformed themselves to maintain power and influence among their people.

Anyway, Pope Paul III established the Roman Inquisition, which had the authority to arrest and execute heretics. Doesn't that smell a little Machiavellian? Connections, baby. We're making those connections. The church is doing whatever it can to maintain power, including fear and intimidation. Additionally, the church established an Index of Prohibited Books, which was a list of books that taught heretical doctrines, and it included works by the Christian humanist Erasmus and several Protestant reformers as well.

But without doubt, the most significant act of the Catholic Reformation was the Council of Trent, which met intermittently from 1545 to 1563. Its purpose was to reform the Catholic Church and forge some reconciliation with Protestants. The council made some gains on the former but basically did nothing on the latter. So at the council, the church began to clean up some of its corrupt practices that caused the Protestants so much angst. It suppressed simony and forbade the sale of indulgences. Also, the council reaffirmed the celibacy of the clergy. You know, medieval priests were a little loose with this one, to put it mildly. And with these corruptions purged, the Catholic Church experienced a spiritual renewal in what was established in the council lasted to the middle of the 20th century.

Now the council also reaffirmed classical Catholic doctrines like transubstantiation, equal authority of the pope and the scriptures, in the seven sacraments, etc. And so by doing this, reconciliation with Protestants was not possible. In reaffirming these doctrines, the council permanently cemented the division in Christianity.

Regardless, the Catholic Church itself continued to experience renewal, and one of the manifestations of that was the establishment of new religious orders. Saint Theresa of Avila established the Carmelite order, and she founded numerous convents and brought their order back to a stricter form of the faith, emphasizing asceticism and poverty. Probably the most significant new order to be established was the Jesuits. It was founded by Ignatius of Loyola for the purpose of spiritual renewal, and members of the order took vows of poverty and chastity, and they established schools and far-reaching missionary efforts. It was the Jesuits that brought Catholicism to India and Japan and Brazil and North America and Africa. But they also concentrated their missionary efforts at home, and through their work, many of the southern provinces of the Holy Roman Empire returned to Catholicism.

Okay, let's turn the corner now and look at this period from the bottom up. We've talked a lot about the major figures and rulers so far, but now let's talk about the people. And I reckon we ought to begin with the social hierarchy. Social hierarchies define a person's social status regarding class and religion and gender in both rural and urban settings.

Now prior to this period, a person's class was established at birth by one's wealth and family. But with the rise of the merchant elite, some of whom became very wealthy, movement upward was now a possibility, which is to say class status was not necessarily connected with land anymore nor your family of origin. Even so, land ownership still held quite a bit of prestige. For example, in the English Parliament, the upper house, the House of Lords, was reserved for the landed citizens, while the lower house, the House of Commons, was reserved for those without land, even if some of them were very wealthy.

When it came to religion, a person's beliefs certainly mattered in terms of social standing. Recall that if you were a Huguenot in Catholic France, you stood a good chance of getting slaughtered at a wedding. Additionally, the Spanish throne took pains to expel the Jews from their land. So yeah, you needed to believe the right thing if you were gonna live the good life in Europe.

In terms of gender, patriarchy was the order of the day, which meant that it was a male-dominated society. Women were expected to submit to their husbands and fathers, and their earnings belonged to the men in their lives. So it shouldn't surprise you to hear that women were largely excluded from the economic and political life of Europe. This was connected to the entire political structure of the European states. For example, Charles the First of England understood himself as the father of the nation, and only if the family hierarchy was preserved would his own authority be preserved.

Now this standard was more evident in urban wealthy families where they had more freedom to order their households. In rural households, men and women were more equal, even though there were separate spheres of work for both in certain roles that they each fulfilled. Regardless, urban and rural households organized themselves around the nuclear family instead of the extended family.

Now as it happened, the Renaissance and Reformation raised debates about this patriarchal structure in women's proper role in society. Among French intellectuals, they debated what they called the querelle des femmes, which when being translated means "the woman question." Mainly, it was a debate over whether women were fit to receive university education. On one side, folks argued that no, they were not fit, since women were naturally inferior to men. And how did they know? Well, wasn't it Eve who was deceived by the serpent and led the entire human race into sin and misery? And then the other side of the argument went like this: if women are inferior, it's only because men have withheld education from them. After all, look at Queen Elizabeth in England -- she was educated and ruled like a boss.

In the Catholic Church, women of course could not be priests and furthermore could hold no position of authority over a man. But they could become nuns, and that was something. In the context of a convent, nuns had the opportunity to use their artistic or medical or leadership gifts in the context of a community of women.

Now on the Protestant side of things, Luther and Calvin both taught that the wife ought to be subservient to her husband and put herself on display as the model of obedience and charity. But it was only the Anabaptists who gave women positions of authority, and some of them even became preachers. And out of all the Anabaptists who were martyred during this period, nearly a third of them were women in leadership.

Now during this period, with so many people moving from the country into the city and with a larger challenge to religious authority occurring because of the Reformation, city governments were left with the task of creating laws to legislate public morals where the church did this before. Now the task was falling on secular authorities. So for example, during this period, many municipal authorities outlawed prostitution. Protestants believed that marriage was the only legitimate remedy for lust. Therefore, they worked to get local governments to pass laws to close and ban brothels.

In some places, authorities tried to restrict the festivities during a yearly celebration of Carnival. Since medieval times, this was a festival held right before Lent, which was the fasting season of the church, and people went positively crazy during Carnival. They got drunk and danced for days, dressed up as people in authority like kings and popes, and so it was kind of an upside-down society for a few days. But because it was motivated by the Catholic doctrine of penance during Lent, some Protestant leaders attempted to make laws restricting the excesses of Carnival. However, in more rural areas far from the reach of the state, people persisted in celebrating like this.

Now in order to keep everyone in line, local and church authorities had certain public punishments and humiliations to keep the populace from violating certain legal and social norms. If you broke the law, you might find yourself in the stocks, in which your head, arms, and feet were restrained in blocks of wood. But don't worry, it was usually right in the center of town so that any passerby could hurl rotten food and waste at the prisoner. Also, there was flogging with a cane or a whip, and sometimes you got flogged before you went in the stock. So you know, that was a bad day.

Even so, with the rise of capitalism -- on which more in the next unit -- a new culture of leisure was on the rise. In their free time, people began attending in greater numbers blood sports like boxing or bullfighting or jousting. Additionally, saints' days festivities drew huge crowds for celebrations according to the church calendar. For example, All Saints' Day was a festival celebrating all the saints that have departed. They maintained a strong belief in the mystical connection between the church triumphant -- which is those who have already reached heaven -- and the church militant -- which were those who are still alive on earth.

The last thing I'll say about society during this period is this: even with all the religious and political upheaval occurring, many people still held on to folk ideas that have been passed down through the generations. Related to that was the witchcraft craze of the 16th and 17th centuries. To Catholic and Protestant leaders during this time, witchcraft was evidence of a pact with the devil and thus ought to be feared and extinguished. Before the advent of science, many common illnesses or unfortunate events were attributed to witches. The belief grew that witches were in league with the devil to overthrow Christianity. And so with the stakes getting higher and higher, the stage was set for a witch hunt.

Historians estimate that in the 16th and 17th centuries, between 40 to 60,000 people were executed for witchcraft, the majority of them women. And that takes us right back to the belief that women were inferior. It was believed that women were not as morally strong as men and therefore were more susceptible to agreement with the devil. Three-quarters of those executions occurred in the Holy Roman Empire alone. And why is that? Well, it's hard to know for sure, but think of this: it was within the Holy Roman Empire that the Protestant Reformation began, which resulted in serious social upheaval. Additionally, these people experienced a great deal of destruction and death during the Thirty Years' War. So it could be that those people were attempting to regain some control of their lives by scapegoating women as witches.

Okay, now the last thing we need to do in this unit is talk about art. Mannerism developed during the Renaissance, and it was an art form in which artists made use of distorted figures, large musculature, and vibrant color in order to communicate deep emotion and drama. A great example of mannerism is Michelangelo's The Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel. I mean, if you want drama, it's all here. It's judgment day, and here you see the damned in a pretty bad way while the saints are rising to bliss.

But also during this period, a new innovation in art developed called Baroque. It was extravagant in form, ornate and detailed in style, and highly emotional and dramatic. It began in Rome during the Catholic Reformation. As the church was undergoing renewal, they sought to appeal to the people and persuade them to reinvest their confidence in the church. It was precisely this ornate and dramatic style by which the Catholics sought to critique the often barren and muted styles of Protestant art. It was also a sign of wealth and power, and the more ornate and the greater the size of the cathedral, the more it would reflect the power which the Catholic church was so desperately trying to hold on to during this period.

Probably the greatest artist in the Baroque style was Peter Paul Rubens. Look here at this painting, The Elevation of the Cross, and you can see the flurry of action and emotion surrounding the body of Christ. It's magnificent.
