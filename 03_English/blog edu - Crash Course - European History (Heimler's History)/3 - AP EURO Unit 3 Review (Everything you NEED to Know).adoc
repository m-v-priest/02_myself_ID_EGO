== 释义


All right, you're here for a review of Unit 3 of AP European History 美国大学预修课程欧洲历史, so let's get to it. Get them brain cows ready for milking because we ain't got no time to waste. Now the title of this unit tells you what it's all about: absolutism 专制主义 and constitutionalism 立宪主义. These are two new innovations 创新 on government that are going to dominate 主导 Europe during this period. So the question is: which states will become absolutist 专制主义的 and which states will become constitutional 立宪的, and why? +

Intrigue 阴谋 and everything we talked about in the last unit sets the stage for 为……奠定基础 these innovations in government. In that unit, states were working to centralize power 集权, and the Reformation 宗教改革 and the Wars of Religion 宗教战争 helped states along that road by merging 合并 political and religious authorities 政治和宗教权力 and providing common enemies to unite against 提供共同敌人以联合对抗. And as a result, those states would go one of two ways in this unit: absolutism or constitutionalism. And I reckon 认为 we ought to start with absolutism. +

Okay, one of the major political shifts 政治转变 during this period was the shift towards absolutism in European monarchies 君主制, and that's exactly what it sounds like. Absolutism describes how monarchs 君主 consolidated 巩固 all state power under themselves in order to advance 促进 the needs of their own state. Now remember that prior to this period, power was distributed 分配 among monarchs, nobles 贵族, and the church. But during this period, monarchs looked around at each other and said, "Hey, y'all want all the power?" To which they responded, "Absolutely monarchical power." Joke. Nailed it. +

Anyway, let's consider a couple of factors that led to the rise of absolutist states 专制主义国家. First, there was the weakened influence of the Catholic Church due to a growing acceptance and tolerance of Protestant practice 新教实践 and a lack of interest in religious warfare 宗教战争 after the Peace of Westphalia 威斯特伐利亚和约. Second, merchant classes 商人阶级 were expanding rapidly during this period of global trade, and in some measure 在某种程度上 they desired absolute monarchs 专制君主 for the economic and political stability 经济和政治稳定 they could provide. Additionally 此外, this meant that power was shifting away from landed nobility 拥有土地的贵族 into the hands of this new merchant class. +

So when I mentioned earlier that power was shared between three entities 实体, look at what's happening now: the power of the nobility is waning 减弱, and so is the power of the church, and who's left? Monarchs. And their power is only going to increase during this period. +

Now you're going to need to know some examples of these absolutist rulers 专制统治者, and the poster boy 典型代表 for absolutism is and always will be Louis XIV of France 法国的路易十四. He was fond of saying "L'état, c'est moi," which when being translated means, "I am the state." In other words, he saw himself in his own person as the highest and only authority for France. +

Now while Louis was still a child, events were unfolding 发生 in France that would enable him to become that all-powerful monarch 全能君主 that he eventually became, and these events collectively 共同地 are known as the Fronde 投石党运动. This was a rebellion 叛乱 of French nobles against Cardinal Mazarin 马扎然红衣主教, who was ruling France at the time when Louis was only a child. As Mazarin consolidated power in a centralized state 集权国家, therefore diminishing 削弱 the power of the nobles, that was just too much for them. The short story is that the Fronde threw France into chaos 混乱, and Mazarin ultimately prevailed 获胜. But the key takeaway 关键要点 was this: the vast majority of French people realized that they needed to have a strong ruler 强大的统治者 to protect them from each other and from living in chaos. So when Louis finally comes of age 成年 and is all like, "I am the state," the people are ready for such a development. +

Now those words would mean absolutely nothing if Louis couldn't back it up 支持；证实 by actually ruling absolutely, and he did that in the following ways. With the help of his finance minister 财政大臣 Jean-Baptiste Colbert 让 - 巴蒂斯特·柯尔贝尔, Louis XIV introduced several reforms that helped consolidate power under his throne 巩固王权. First was the intendant system 总督制度. Louis sent bureaucratic agents 官僚代理人 called intendants 总督 into the various districts of France who acted as avatars 化身 of Louis himself. As such, whatever policies Louis passed, his intendant would make sure that they were obeyed throughout France. Now this undermined 削弱 the authority of local governors 地方官员 and, more to the point 更重要的是, the nobility, and made sure all parts of Louis's kingdom were made to obey his will 服从他的意志. So if you lived under Louis's rule and he imposed a law 颁布法律 and you were like, "Ah, the king lives all the way over there, I'll never know whether I obey or not," well, you're probably going to go ahead and get your head chopped off 被斩首 because the king was there in effect 通过他的总督实际上就在那里. +

Through all of these actions, Louis was steadily consolidating power under himself and away from local administrators 地方行政官员 and nobles. Another way Louis consolidated power was in the construction of the Palace of Versailles 凡尔赛宫 (or if you live in the American South like I do, "Versailles"). Anyway, in order to undermine the authority of the nobles, he had many of them relocated into his own palace at Versailles. There he could keep an eye on them 监视他们 and demand their loyalty 要求他们忠诚. I mean, it's awfully difficult to do anything to undermine the king's power when you live in his house. In order to keep the nobility from thinking too much about losing their power, Louis threw parties on the regular 经常举办派对 and pushed enough alcohol on them to kill a stout farm animal. And you know, it actually worked for a while. +

Next, Louis revoked 废除 the Edict of Nantes 南特敕令, and in this way, Louis took power away from the Catholic Church. The Edict of Nantes was put in place by Henry IV 亨利四世 and established an almost unheard-of degree of religious tolerance 宗教宽容 in France for the Protestant minority 新教少数派 living there. Louis decided that to have a state whose people did not all conform to 符合 his own religious beliefs (which is to say Catholicism 天主教) wasn't a good look for a man who desired absolute power 专制权力. And in removing protection for the Huguenots 胡格诺派, hundreds of thousands of them migrated to more tolerant states, robbing France of a healthy portion of their merchant class 商人阶级. Additionally, Louis essentially made himself the head of the Catholic Church in France, which merged political and religious loyalties 政治和宗教忠诚 of the French population. +

And finally, Louis worked to consolidate power through military expansion 军事扩张. Now we'll talk more about Louis's wars in a moment, but for now, let me just mention how they were paid for. In order to finance 为……提供资金 Louis's endless wars, his finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert shaped the French economy according to mercantilist policies 重商主义政策, which meant that he enacted 制定 steep tariffs 高额关税 throughout France and made sure that they were exporting more than they were importing 保持贸易顺差. And this had the effect of decreasing France's debt 减少法国债务. It also breathed new life into 为……注入新活力 domestic industries 国内产业, expanded France's colonial holdings 殖民地, and created a favorable balance of trade 贸易顺差. But despite all the good work Colbert did, Louis's wars undid most of it. +

Okay, now another absolutist ruler you should know is Peter the Great of Russia 俄罗斯的彼得大帝. By the time Peter became tsar 沙皇 in 1682, Russia was still socially and politically organized according to medieval standards 中世纪标准. Other European nations in the west had adopted new technology and new methods of education and finance, while Russia lagged behind 落后 in a sort of feudalistic society 封建主义社会. So Peter went on a little trip to some of these western nations to see how they did things and returned home convinced that Russia had to westernize 西方化 or else be overtaken by 被……超越 the western European states. +

And so here are some of the reforms Peter introduced to modernize Russia while at the same time consolidating power under himself. First, Peter introduced political reform 政治改革. He required nobles to serve in the army or the civil administration 军队或民政部门. There was a series of ranks called the Table of Ranks 官秩表 that nobles could move through, which meant that experts ended up on top. And to Peter, this was both essential to a modern government 现代政府 and the key to reducing the power of the nobility 削弱贵族权力. Second, he introduced religious reform 宗教改革. He reorganized the Russian Orthodox Church 俄罗斯东正教会 by eliminating the role of patriarch 牧首 (which was kind of like the pope of the Orthodox Church) and replaced it with the Holy Synod 圣会议, which Peter populated with officials and ministers who would do Peter's bidding 听命于彼得. And third, Peter introduced cultural reforms 文化改革, which is to say he tried to shape the Russian culture to fit the image of western Europe 使俄罗斯文化符合西欧形象. To that end 为此, Peter required nobles to wear western clothing 西式服装 and shave their beards 刮胡子. If you refused to shave your beard, you had to pay a beard tax 胡须税. So needless to say, Peter would not approve of your boy Heimler. There you go. +

Now in order to pull off 成功实现 all these innovations, Peter tripled taxes 使税收增加三倍, and that meant that most of the nobles and peasantry 农民 despised 厌恶 Peter's reforms. Even so, Peter's work to westernize Russia brought the nation into the mainstream of European development 欧洲发展的主流, and that process was continued through his later successor, Catherine the Great 叶卡捷琳娜大帝. +

Now even though many monarchs were moving towards absolutism, there were a couple of significant exceptions 例外, and I reckon we ought to talk about them now, namely the English and the Dutch. First, the English. As France, Prussia 普鲁士, Austria 奥地利, and Russia were all moving towards absolutism, England was moving in the opposite direction towards constitutionalism 立宪主义. Now constitutionalism means that the government would be limited by the rule of law 法治, or to put it another way 换句话说, the monarch had to share power with a representative body 代议机构. And in the case of England, that would be the Parliament 议会. +

But there was some trouble on the horizon 即将来临 which would eventually lead England into a civil war 内战 to settle just how much power the monarch would have, and that would be the English Civil War 英国内战, which lasted from 1642 to 1651. The first cause was the doctrine of the divine right of kings 君权神授学说. This idea was gaining traction 获得支持 throughout Europe and during this period it bled into 渗透到 England as well. After Elizabeth I 伊丽莎白一世 died without an heir 没有继承人, James I 詹姆斯一世 succeeded 继承 her. He believed that the monarch was God's representative on earth 上帝在人间的代表 and therefore any curtailment of his power 对他权力的限制 is an affront to 对……的冒犯 God's own power. In other words, the king represents Jesus himself, and ain't nobody taking away power from Jesus. But unfortunately for him, England had created that pesky Magna Carta 大宪章 in 1215, which created the English Parliament and gave it control over the money 控制财政 and thus prevented any king from wielding absolute power 行使绝对权力. +

Okay, so then Charles I 查理一世 succeeded James and inherited this divine right belief 君权神授观念 from his father. They believed that since they were representatives of God, property, for example, could be taken for the throne with immunity 豁免权. This of course led to significant tensions 紧张关系 between the monarchs and the Parliament, specifically the House of Commons 下议院, who liked to remind the king that English traditions forbade 禁止 anyone's property from being taken from them except through the due process of law 正当法律程序. To which the king responded, "Wouldn't that be hilarious if I believed that?" So that belief in the divine right of kings is for sure causing tension in England during this time. +

The second cause of the war was economic 经济原因. Now Charles grew further embittered against 更加怨恨 Parliament because of the economic troubles England faced after having fought the Thirty Years' War 三十年战争 (which we talked about in the last unit) and the need to raise an army to fend off 抵御 an Irish rebellion 爱尔兰叛乱 as well. He and his father spent metric buttloads of money 大量花钱 without oversight from Parliament, who was always trying to rein in 控制 the spending of these extravagant monarchs 挥霍无度的君主. And the solution Charles came up with in 1629 to avoid those restrictions 避免这些限制 was to refuse to call Parliament into session 召开议会, and therefore they couldn't bother him. Easy peasy lemon squeezy 小菜一碟. But in order to crush the rebellion in Scotland 镇压苏格兰叛乱, Charles was forced to call Parliament into session in 1640, and it became known as the Long Parliament 长期议会. This Parliament passed the Triennial Act 三年法案, which forced the king to call Parliament into session at least once every three years 至少每三年召开一次议会, thus creating more limits on the power of the king 对王权施加更多限制. And so the tension was revived 重新加剧. +

The third cause of the war was, not surprisingly, religion 宗教原因. Now the Church of England 英国国教会 was established by Henry VIII 亨利八世 during the growing movement of Protestantism 新教运动. However, despite some significant changes in theology 神学, the Anglican Church 英国圣公会 (which is another way of saying the Church of England) retained 保留 quite a few practices and structures from the Catholic Church 天主教会的许多仪式和结构, like the hierarchy of bishops and priests 主教和牧师的等级制度. However, a growing minority in the church known as the Puritans 清教徒 were getting a little saucy 不安分 about these Catholic holdovers 天主教遗留问题 and wanted to purify the church 净化教会 by ridding it of all these vestiges of Roman Catholicism 消除罗马天主教的所有痕迹. James I refused to bow to their demands 屈服于他们的要求, and Charles I went so far as to marry a Catholic 甚至娶了一位天主教徒. No! Oh yeah. Anyway, those three realities were causing significant tension between the king and Parliament, and in 1642, the English Civil War began. +

Essentially, it was a conflict 冲突 between the king, Parliament, and other elites 精英 over their respective roles 各自的角色 in the political structure 政治结构. After three years of fighting, the Parliament's New Model Army 议会新模范军 was victorious over 战胜 the king's army. However, Charles I refused to concede 投降, and at this point, a member of the House of Commons who also happened to be a Puritan, namely Oliver Cromwell 奥利弗·克伦威尔, rose up 崛起 and led the parliamentary army against the king and won a decisive victory 取得决定性胜利. Afterward, Cromwell kicked out 驱逐 any members of Parliament who opposed him, and those representatives that were left were known as the Rump Parliament 残缺议会. The Rump Parliament then tried Charles I for treason 以叛国罪审判查理一世, found him guilty 判定有罪, and went ahead and cut his head off 斩首. And that is how you abolish kingship 废除君主制 in England, ladies and gentlemen. +

But just to be clear, Cromwell is a great example of a ruler who got slap drunk with power 被权力冲昏头脑. His intent through the war was to create a commonwealth 共和国 in England, but in reality, he created a dictatorship 独裁统治. He didn't give the people the rights that they thought they'd been fighting for, but instead consolidated all the power under himself, and in that way, he fit Machiavelli's definition of a leader who held on to power at all costs 不惜一切代价维护权力. +

Okay, now let's talk about the consequences of the English Civil War 英国内战的后果. As a result of this war, England became a true republic 共和国 called the Protectorate 护国公政体 under the leadership of Oliver Cromwell, who was named Lord Protector 护国公. And though in word 从名义上 England was now a republic, in reality 实际上, it was ruled as a military dictatorship 军事独裁统治 with Cromwell at the head. The people were none too happy with this arrangement 对这种安排不太满意, not least because as a Puritan, Cromwell imposed the same kind of strict moralistic rules 严格的道德准则 upon England that John Calvin 约翰·加尔文 imposed in Geneva: no drinking, no swearing, no dancing. You know, no wonder they weren't happy. Anyway, the Protectorate ended up falling apart 瓦解 after Cromwell's death in 1658. So you know, get them filthy mouths out, strike up and dance, and raise a glass. So by 1660, Parliament restored the monarchy 复辟君主制, giving the throne to Charles II 查理二世, and this became known as the Restoration period 复辟时期. +

But Charles II did not fulfill their hopes 实现他们的期望. He schemed with 与……密谋 France and didn't work well with Parliament. Then James II 詹姆斯二世 came to power after Charles II, and he was kind of a turd （俚语，令人讨厌的人） by English reckoning 按照英国人的看法. He appointed all kinds of Catholics to important positions in the army and universities and the government. No! Oh yeah. So Parliament, realizing that they had just fought a civil war to rid England of turd kings 摆脱糟糕的国王, resisted James and instead offered the throne to James's daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange 奥兰治的威廉. And when James heard of this plan, like a real man, he fled, abdicating his throne 退位, and William and Mary rose to power in 1689. This transfer of power was known as the Glorious Revolution 光荣革命 because monarchs were changed without bloodshed 不流血 (except that there were quite a few rebellions and quite a bit of bloodshed 除了有一些叛乱和不少流血事件). But regardless 不管怎样，with the ascension 登基 of William and Mary to the throne, the idea of the divine right of kings in England was officially put to death 终结，and England had established a true constitutional monarchy 君主立宪制. +.

And a significant means by which Parliament did this was by enacting 颁布 the English Bill of Rights 权利法案，which included provisions for Parliament to levy taxes 征税 (not the monarch) and stipulated 规定 that when Parliament made a law, it could not be annulled by the monarch 君主不能废除. Additionally 此外，William and Mary were not allowed to assume the throne 登上王位 until they signed the Bill of Rights. +.

Okay, now let's talk about the other exception to absolutism during this period, namely the Dutch 荷兰人. Now because of their strategic location 战略位置 on the Atlantic 大西洋，the trading city of Antwerp 安特卫普 led the Dutch to become the most prosperous state 最繁荣的国家 in Europe during this period. For almost a century, the region had been controlled by the Habsburg rulers in Spain 西班牙哈布斯堡王朝统治者，and as the Dutch grew increasingly prosperous 日益繁荣，Philip II of Spain 西班牙的腓力二世 decided to get his inbred hands on 夺取 more of that wealth. So he enacted policies 制定政策 that would clamp down on 压制 the Netherlands and direct more of their wealth to the Spanish throne 西班牙王室. Furthermore 此外，the Netherlands had become a hotbed of Protestantism 新教的温床，especially the Calvinist flavor 加尔文教派，and as it grew, Philip (who was of course a Catholic 天主教徒) became more and more frustrated at their lack of obedience 不顺从. And when Dutch Protestant agitators 煽动者 began destroying and desecrating 亵渎 Catholic churches across the Netherlands, Philip went ahead and sent an army to squash the rebellion 镇压叛乱 and ended up killing thousands of Dutch Protestants on charges of treason 以叛国罪处死数千荷兰新教徒. That's when Protestant leader William of Orange 奥兰治的威廉 rose to leadership 崛起并领导 and led the Dutch Protestants in ridding the Netherlands of Spanish influence 摆脱西班牙的影响. Wait, William of Orange? Isn't that the guy who came to power in England after the civil war? It is indeed the same guy, but before he was king in England, he was head of state 国家元首 in the Dutch Republic 荷兰共和国. +.

Now the Dutch Republic 荷兰共和国 was officially formed by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which in addition to ending the Thirty Years' War 三十年战争 also ended the Eighty Years' War 八十年战争 between the Dutch and the Spanish. As a result of this, the Dutch Republic emerged as the wealthiest European commercial empire 欧洲最富有的商业帝国. They led in trade in the Atlantic world 大西洋世界 for a time and had a large footprint 影响力 in the Indian Ocean trade 印度洋贸易 as well. Now the newly independent Dutch did not install a king 设立国王 but rather established an oligarchy 寡头政治，which is essentially a government ruled by a small group of people 由一小群人统治的政府. In this case, the oligarchy was made up of 由…… 组成 the urban gentry 城市绅士 and wealthy landowners 富有的土地所有者，which represented each province of the Netherlands 代表荷兰各省，and together they made up the States General 联省议会 and decided questions of foreign and domestic policy 决定国内外政策问题. And you can't think of the States General as if it were a representative government 代议制政府 like they had to some degree in England. The men who made up the States General were elite members of society 社会精英 and typically passed policies that served their own best interests 通常通过符合自身利益的政策. Even so, the British and the Dutch stand apart during this period as examples of European countries that did not go the way of absolutism 专制主义道路. +.

Okay, we've been talking about how power has shifted and been reallocated 重新分配 during this period, but now let's talk about power on a broader European scale 更广泛的欧洲范围. Now as you know from the last unit, the Peace of Westphalia effectively ended the period of religious wars in Europe 结束了欧洲的宗教战争时期. Religion was a major factor in why states went to war prior to this period 在此之前，宗教是各国开战的主要因素，but after Westphalia, the main reason wars occurred was to maintain the delicate balance of power 维持微妙的权力平衡 in Europe. And the balance of power 权力平衡 was the constant pursuit of 不断追求 making sure that all nations in the continent were more or less equal in power 大致权力平等，and that way no one nation can dominate the entire continent 没有一个国家能主宰整个欧洲大陆. +.

Now you'll need to know a few examples of how this pursuit of the balance of power worked out 实现，so let's start with the partition of Poland 瓜分波兰. This idea of the balance of power sealed the fate of Poland 决定了波兰的命运 and essentially wiped it off the map 从地图上抹去 for about 150 years. Poland itself was a constitutional monarchy 君主立宪制国家，but it was riddled with weaknesses 充满弱点. The landed nobles 拥有土地的贵族 exploited the peasantry 剥削农民 and made a habit of defying the king 习惯于违抗国王. Additionally 此外，they did not have a robust bureaucracy 强大的官僚体系 like Britain to unite the country 团结国家，and they had been weakened by almost constant war for decades 几十年的持续战争使其国力衰弱. Add to that 除此之外，Poland was surrounded by absolute states 专制国家，namely Russia, Prussia, and Austria, and any absolutist worth his or her salt 称职的专制统治者 can smell weakness like a shark can smell blood in the water 能像鲨鱼闻到血腥味一样嗅到弱点. +.

Now the balance of power between these three nations was initially unbalanced by Russia's victories against the Ottoman Empire 奥斯曼帝国，which made Russia the stronger nation in the central European sphere 中欧地区更强大的国家. So instead of going to war against Russia, Austria and Prussia decided to propose a diplomatic solution 外交解决方案: "But Poland sits right here in the middle of us. They're weak, so how about we just divide Poland up between us and maintain the balance of power without having to fight about it?" It took about 25 years starting in 1772, but eventually Poland was annexed into 被吞并 these three rival powers 敌对势力 and disappeared from the map. But you know, it's okay because the balance of power was restored, right? +.

Okay, what else did the pursuit of the balance of power cause? Well, the need for a balance of power increasingly created the need for countries to go to war with each other and expand their military 扩军. For example, let's talk about the Battle of Vienna in 1683 维也纳之战. The Ottoman Empire was massive in the 17th century 在 17 世纪幅员辽阔 and held possessions in southeastern Europe 控制着东南欧地区，and they had ambitions to push further into central Europe 有进一步向中欧扩张的野心. They attempted to invade Austria in the Battle of Vienna in order to secure better trading routes along the Danube River 多瑙河更好的贸易路线. In order to keep this expansion from happening and thus disrupting the balance of power 破坏权力平衡，the Austrian Habsburgs 奥地利哈布斯堡王朝，Poland (before the partition 瓜分前), and the Holy Roman Empire 神圣罗马帝国 united to stop the invasion 联合抵御入侵 and did so successfully. With the balance of power restored 恢复平衡，that battle marked the end of Ottoman expansion into Europe 标志着奥斯曼帝国在欧洲扩张的结束. +.

Oh yeah, remember when I mentioned Louis XIV's wars 路易十四的战争？Let's talk about him now. Louis XIV was pretty thirsty to gain power and territory 渴望获得权力和领土 and engaged in almost endless wars 发动几乎无休止的战争 in order to make gains in French territory 扩大法国领土 and his dynasty 王朝 along with other strategic dynasties that increased Louis's power. He fought the Dutch War 法荷战争 to gain territory in the Spanish Netherlands 西属尼德兰 and to weaken the Habsburgs 哈布斯堡王朝，which was ultimately unsuccessful 最终失败. He also fought in the War of Spanish Succession 西班牙王位继承战争 from 1702 to 1713 to pursue his own dynastic interest 追求王朝利益. When Charles II of Spain 西班牙的查理二世 died, it was arranged that Philip V 腓力五世 succeed him, but the saucy part 有意思的部分 was that Philip actually was Louis XIV's grandson 路易十四的孙子. More intrigue 更多阴谋 now. +.

Several European nations feared this arrangement because it meant that potentially France and Spain could be combined and ruled under a single throne 合并并由一个君主统治，namely Louis XIV's throne. Now given each nation's extensive colonial holdings 广阔的殖民地，this would decisively tip the balance of power 打破权力平衡 towards France and Spain, and then who could stand against them? And so war immediately broke out to prevent this scenario 情况. So England, the United Provinces 联合省，Austria, and Prussia fought against France, Spain, and Bavaria 巴伐利亚. And remember what this war was about: it wasn't a religious war but rather a war to prevent one nation (France in this case) from gaining too much power and thus upsetting the balance of power in Europe 破坏欧洲权力平衡. And that is crucial to remember. +.

Well, the war ended in 1713 with the Treaty of Utrecht 乌得勒支和约，which did a lot of things, but for our purposes, we just need to point out that the treaty stipulated 规定 that Philip V would remain on the Spanish throne but that France and Spain must remain separate entities 保持独立. So the Treaty of Utrecht maintained the balance of power in Europe 维持了欧洲的权力平衡. +.

Okay, now third, the pursuit of the balance of power led European nations to expand their militaries 扩军 because, you know, you just can't kill other Europeans without a sizeable army 没有庞大的军队不行. And the key player here was Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden 瑞典的古斯塔夫・阿道夫. Small militias 小型民兵组织 became obsolete 过时 as Adolphus built a massive professional standing army 庞大的专业常备军 and deployed it mightily during the Thirty Years' War 三十年战争. They were highly organized into ascending ranks 等级分明 so that the hierarchy of authority 权力等级制度 was clear. Also, new military technology was developed 发展，from firearms 火器 to mobile cannon 移动火炮 to more elaborate fortifications 复杂的防御工事. But in order to finance all of this 为这一切提供资金，Adolphus was required to raise taxes 增税 and expand the bureaucracy 扩大官僚机构 in order to keep everything organized. Other European leaders looked at the Swedish army and were like, "Dang, I got to get me some of that," not least Louis XIV 尤其是路易十四. And this expansion of the military affected the balance of power significantly 极大地影响了权力平衡. It was those nations who expanded their military in the ways that I just mentioned that found themselves on the winning side of the balance of power 处于权力平衡的有利一方. +.

Okay, now it's time to talk about agriculture 农业 because during this period, farming underwent some major innovations 重大创新，and taken all together 总的来说，it's known as the Agricultural Revolution 农业革命. It started in Britain and the Low Countries of the Netherlands 低地国家，and here's the crazy thing: more and more people were moving to urban areas for industrial work 工业工作. For example, recall from Unit 1 the enclosure movement 圈地运动，which gradually reduced the amount of land available to farmers 可耕地面积，and that sent a lot of them to the cities looking for work 进城找工作. But even with fewer farmers, agricultural output 农业产量 nearly tripled 几乎增加两倍 in various places across Europe. How did that happen? So glad you asked. +.

Now remember the farming innovations from the last period, the most significant of which was the three-field system 三圃制，and that was a big deal 很重要. But still, a third of the land had to lie fallow 休耕 every year so that the soil's nutrients could be replenished 补充养分. But in this period, a new innovation was developed in order to replenish the nutrients of the soil 补充土壤养分. Farmers discovered that they could alternate 轮换 grain crops 谷物 (which leach nutrients from the soil 消耗土壤养分) with other crops that restored nutrients to the soil 补充养分，like potatoes and clover 三叶草. Now fields could produce crops with no yearly fallow period 无需休耕. This had the effect of dramatically increasing the food supply 极大增加粮食供应 and other agricultural goods 农产品. +.

Additionally 此外，this period saw the introduction of several new farming technologies 农业技术，three of which I'm going to tell you about now. First was the introduction of Jethro Tull's seed drill 条播机，which made sure the seeds were planted at exact intervals 精确间隔 and covered them over with dirt 覆土. Another innovation, the mechanical hoe 机械锄头，was able to increase the efficiency with which weeds were removed from the soil 除草效率. And third was the cast iron plow 铸铁犁，which in addition to digging furrows for planting more efficiently 更高效犁地，was made with interchangeable parts 可互换部件 that allowed for easier repair 便于维修 and quicker manufacturing 更快制造. +.

Now also contributing to this increased production of food 粮食增产 was the Columbian Exchange 哥伦布大交换，which we talked about in Unit 1. One of the key foods for peasants 农民 was the potato 土豆，which was exceedingly nutritious 营养丰富 and cheap to grow 种植成本低. In fact, half an acre of potatoes could feed a family all year long 养活一家人一年. And with all the new foods being introduced like avocados 牛油果 and beans 豆类 and squashes 南瓜，the diet of Europeans expanded 饮食更加丰富，which led to better health 身体健康 and longer lifespans 寿命延长. +.

Now of course, no discussion of Europe from 1648 to 1815 would be complete without some chatter on economic developments 经济发展，am I right? You know I'm right. So let's start with economic shifts on the ground 经济变化，and then we'll look at them from the state perspective 国家层面. So during this period, labor and trade were increasingly freed from traditional restrictions 摆脱传统限制 imposed by governments and corporate entities 政府和企业，and this occurred most dramatically in England 英国最为明显. For example, prior to this period, workers would only be paid if they were part of a guild 行会，which had its own authority structure 权力结构. The guilds usually controlled prices and kept them high 控制价格并维持高价，which benefited the elite 精英阶层 rather than the workers. With the rise and transformation of Britain's wool industry 羊毛产业 (which had been around since medieval times 中世纪), British manufacturers began paying wages directly to workers 直接向工人支付工资，which had the effect of limiting the influence of guilds 限制行会影响. This had the further effect of raising workers' wages 提高工资 because since they got paid per garment 按件计酬，there was a great incentive to increase productivity 提高生产积极性. +.

Okay, now let's talk about the context in which many of these workers were performing their labor 劳动环境，namely the cottage industry 家庭手工业. Before the factory became the dominant mode of manufacturing goods 在工厂成为主要生产模式之前 in the Industrial Revolution 工业革命 (on which more in the next unit), goods for purchase 商品 were made mainly in people's homes 家庭生产. That's why we call this the cottage industry. It's also known as the putting-out system 外放制. Merchants and entrepreneurs 商人与企业家 would buy raw materials 原材料 and then pay wages to various people to transform those raw materials into finished goods 制成品. For example, merchants would buy raw cotton or wool 原棉或羊毛 and then they would pay wages to spinners 纺纱工 and weavers 织布工 and dyers 染工 who would then produce a finished textile 纺织品 which could then be sold on the market 市场销售. The system is what laid the foundation for industrialization 工业化奠定基础 in the next century, and this system had the effect of increasing the number of workers 增加就业人数，especially in rural villages 农村，who could earn wages and sustain their family 维持生计. +.

Now the growth of this kind of market economy 市场经济 led to increasing demand for manufactured goods 制成品需求增加，which meant that there was a push to get manufacturing out of people's homes and into new buildings called factories 工厂. Again, we're going to talk way more about this in the next unit, so I'll just mention it briefly here. The first iteration of factories 早期工厂 were all about textile production 纺织生产，which means that they made cloth goods 布料制品. These factories were powered by moving water 水力驱动，which is why they had to be built around rivers and streams 沿河而建，and Richard Arkwright's water frame 水力纺纱机 was a significant invention on this count 重要发明. It was a wheel that was turned by moving water which could then power machines that created fabric and clothing 驱动机器生产布料和服装. Workers became increasingly specialized in their jobs within the factory walls 工厂内分工更细，and no longer would any one person create a sellable good from start to finish 不再一人完成全部生产. But like I said, the cottage industry set the stage for this 家庭手工业奠定基础. In the cottage industry, merchants would bring their goods from one set of workers to the next 依次流转: this house would weave the fabric, that house would dye the fabric, and on and on. And this division of labor 劳动分工 only intensified in the factory 工厂内更明显，and all that put together led to an explosion of demand for manufactured textiles 纺织品需求激增. +.

Now the growth of the market economy led to new financial practices and institutions 金融实践与机构 as well. For example, we see the rise of the insurance industry 保险业 during this time. For a monthly premium 月保费，insurance companies would recoup an entrepreneur's losses if something catastrophic happened like a fire destroying a factory 火灾摧毁工厂等灾难性事件发生时，保险公司将弥补企业家的损失. And with that kind of security 有了这种保障，entrepreneurs, especially in England, gained confidence to invest metric buttloads of money 大量资金 into the factories and the growing inventories of goods for sale 不断增加的待售商品库存. Also, we saw the rise of specialty banks in venture capital 风险投资专业银行兴起. Prior to 1750, if an entrepreneur wanted to build a factory, for example 例如，一位企业家想要建造一家工厂，they would have to borrow money from family or have a fortune of their own 他们不得不向家人借钱或动用自己的财富. But with this explosion of commerce 商业的迅猛发展 due to the rise of the factory system 工厂制度的兴起，specialty banks arose which kept only some of the money people deposited 只保留部分存款 and loaned the rest out as venture capital 其余贷出作为风险资本 to be paid back with interest 还本付息. Venture capital, in case you don't know 以防你不知道，is just what it sounds like 顾名思义: if you have a venture you'd like to attempt 如果你有想尝试的创业项目 (like starting a business or building a factory 比如创业或建厂), then this bank can loan you the capital 银行可以贷给你资金 (which is to say the boom boom 即资金) to get it done. +.

Okay, so that's how economic changes were playing out at the ground level 这就是经济变化在基层的表现，so now let's look at it from the top 现在从国家层面来看 and see how states are experiencing economic change 国家如何经历经济变革. Europeans are going to increasingly control the worldwide economy 全球经济 during this period, and as we've already talked about 正如我们已经讨论过的，that control of the worldwide economy is going to contribute significantly to events like the Agricultural Revolution 农业革命 and the Consumer Revolution 消费革命 (which we'll talk about in the next unit). But the question is: how did they come to dominate the world economy 他们是如何主导世界经济的？Well, states still had their roots sunk in mercantilist policies 重商主义政策. Remember, mercantilism 重商主义 was a state - driven economic system 国家主导的经济体系. The main goal was to increase the country's store of gold and silver 金银储备 by maintaining a favorable balance of trade 贸易顺差，which means more exports than imports 出口大于进口. You can see these kind of policies played out 这些政策得以实施，for example, in France with Louis XIV's finance minister Jean - Baptiste Colbert 比如法国路易十四时期的财政大臣让 - 巴蒂斯特・柯尔贝尔推行的政策. Also remember that one of the key driving factors of mercantilist policies 重商主义政策的关键驱动因素之一 was the establishment of colonies 建立殖民地. And why is that? Because not only were colonies valuable sources of raw materials 原材料来源 for their parent country 母国，but the people who lived there could also buy the manufactured goods produced by those raw materials 购买用这些原材料生产的制成品. And about halfway through this period 在此期间大约一半的时候，mercantilism is going to start giving way to 让位于 capitalism 资本主义. But for now, mercantilist policies are going to fit right in with the political trend of absolutism 专制主义政治趋势. +.

But Europe began dominating the world economy in large part because of increased demand for New World products 新大陆产品 like sugar and rice and cotton 糖、大米和棉花. This increase in demand 需求增长 meant that colonial plantation owners 殖民地种植园主 needed more laborers to harvest their crops 收割作物需要更多劳动力. As indigenous laborers 土著劳动力 quickly died off 死亡 because of European diseases 欧洲疾病 or ran away 逃跑，European planters increasingly turned to African enslaved laborers 非洲奴隶 to work their land 为他们劳作. This had the effect of increasing the food supply in most of Europe 增加了欧洲大部分地区的粮食供应. As I mentioned before 正如我之前提到的，these Africans were captured from their homes 被从家中抓走，forced onto slave ships 被赶上奴隶船，and then made to endure the brutal Middle Passage 忍受残酷的跨大西洋航程，often with only enough room for their prostrate bodies 通常只有躺下的空间. These enslaved Africans endured weeks and sometimes months of disease and brutality 疾病和残酷待遇 only to arrive to similarly harsh conditions in the plantation fields 种植园同样恶劣的环境. +.

And the slave trade 奴隶贸易 was part of a larger system of trade known as the triangular trade 三角贸易. And three guesses as to what shape these trade routes resembled 猜猜这些贸易路线像什么形状. Triangle 三角形？On the nose 猜对了. Me from that camera. And here's how the cycle of trade went 贸易循环如下: merchants started on the west coast of Africa 非洲西海岸 to buy enslaved laborers 购买奴隶，and then they carried them across the Middle Passage 跨越大西洋 to trade them in the Caribbean 加勒比地区 for sugar and molasses 糖和糖蜜，and then sailed up to the Atlantic colonies in North America 北美大西洋殖民地 to trade them for rum 朗姆酒，and then run it all over again 再次循环. +.

Now because enslaved labor kept prices low 奴隶劳动力使价格低廉，this global trade significantly contributed to a growing consumer culture 消费文化 in Europe. In other words 换句话说，because these prices were low 价格低廉，more people were buying more things 更多人购买更多商品. For example, they bought sugar (which was once considered a luxury 曾经被视为奢侈品), they bought textiles made of cotton and silk 棉、丝绸纺织品，and the tobacco trade 烟草贸易 became a massive industry 庞大产业 because what's an evening with friends without those magnificent lung darts 与朋友共度夜晚怎能少得了香烟呢？+.

'''

== 中文释义

好的，你是来复习美国大学预修课程欧洲历史第三单元的，那我们开始吧。让你的大脑做好获取知识的准备，因为我们可没有时间浪费。这个单元的标题就说明了一切：**"专制主义"和"立宪主义"。这是两种新的政府制度创新，在这一时期主导着欧洲。**所以问题是：哪些国家会成为专制国家，哪些国家会成为立宪国家，原因又是什么呢？  +

在上一个单元中, 我们所讨论的各种阴谋和事件，为这些"政府制度"创新奠定了基础。在那个单元中，各**国都在努力集中权力，宗教改革和宗教战争, 通过融合政治和宗教权力，**以及提供共同的敌人来联合对抗，**推动了各国朝着"集中权力"的方向发展。**因此，在这个单元中，这些国家会走向两个方向：专制主义或立宪主义。我认为我们应该从"专制主义"开始讲起。  +

好的，**这一时期的一个重大政治转变, 是欧洲君主制向"专制主义"的转变，**正如其名所示。**#专制主义描述的是君主如何将国家权力, 集中在自己手中，#**以满足国家的需求。记住，**#在这一时期之前，权力是分散在君主、贵族和教会手中的。#**但在这一时期，君主们环顾四周并说道：“嘿，你们想要全部的权力吗？” 然后他们的回答是：“当然是君主专制权力。” 开个玩笑。说中了。  +

不管怎样，让我们来看看导致"专制国家"崛起的几个因素。首先，由于对"新教"实践的接受和宽容程度, 不断提高，以及《威斯特伐利亚和约》（Peace of Westphalia）之后对"宗教战争"缺乏兴趣，天主教会（Catholic Church）的影响力被削弱了(*天主教权力下降, 就意味着君主权力有上升的空间*)。其次，在全球贸易的这一时期，商人阶级迅速扩张，在某种程度上，他们渴望有"专制君主"来提供经济和政治稳定。此外，这意味着权力从拥有土地的贵族手中, 转移到了新兴的商人阶级手中。  +

所以，当我**之前提到权力, 是在三个实体之间共享时，看看现在发生了什么：贵族的权力在减弱，教会的权力也在减弱，那还剩下谁呢？君主。**并且在这一时期，他们的权力只会增加。  +

现在你需要了解一些专制统治者的例子，专制主义的典型代表一直都是法国的路易十四（Louis XIV of France）。他喜欢说 “L'état, c'est moi”，翻译过来就是 “我就是国家”。换句话说，他认为自己就是法国的最高且唯一的权威。  +

在路易十四还是个孩子的时候，法国发生的一些事件, 使他最终成为了那个拥有绝对权力的君主，这些事件统称为投石党运动（Fronde）。这是法国贵族对当时统治法国的马扎然红衣主教（Cardinal Mazarin）的反抗，当时路易十四还是个孩子。马扎然在中央集权国家中巩固权力，因此削弱了贵族的权力，这让贵族们忍无可忍。简而言之，投石党运动让法国陷入了混乱，最终马扎然取得了胜利。但关键的一点是：绝大多数法国人意识到, 他们需要一个强大的统治者来保护他们，使他们免受混乱之苦。所以当路易十四最终成年并宣称 “我就是国家” 时，人们已经为这种情况的出现做好了准备。  +

如果路易十四不能通过实际的绝对统治来支撑他的言论，那么这些话就毫无意义，他通过以下方式做到了这一点。在他的财政大臣让 - 巴蒂斯特·科尔贝（Jean-Baptiste Colbert）的帮助下，**路易十四推出了几项改革，帮助他巩固了自己的统治权力。首先是"总督制度"（intendant system）。路易十四派遣被称为"总督"的官僚代理人, 到法国的各个地区，**这些总督就像是路易十四的化身。因此，无论路易十四通过了什么政策，**他的总督都会确保这些政策在法国各地得到遵守。这削弱了地方总督的权威，更重要的是，削弱了贵族的权威 (相当于中央派直属官吏, 到地方上去管理. 类似乎中国汉朝的削藩策略. 中央派官员直接作为王国的丞相)，**并确保路易十四王国的各个地方都服从他的意志。*#所以，如果你生活在路易十四的统治之下，他颁布了一项法律，而你心想 “国王远在天边，我不遵守也没人知道”，那么，你很可能会被砍头，因为国王通过他的总督实际上无处不在。#*  +

通过这些行动，路易十四稳步地将权力集中在自己手中，削弱了地方行政官员和贵族的权力。路易十四巩固权力的另一种方式, 是建造凡尔赛宫（Palace of Versailles）（或者像我一样生活在美国南部的人会说 “Versailles”）。无论如何，**为了削弱贵族的权威，他把许多贵族迁到了他的凡尔赛宫。在那里，他可以监视他们, 并要求他们忠诚。**我的意思是，**如果你住在国王的宫殿里(在国王眼线的眼皮底下)(也相当于软禁)，就很难(密谋)做出任何削弱国王权力的事情。为了让贵族们不要过多地想着失去权力这件事，路易十四经常举办派对，**给他们提供大量的酒，多到足以醉倒一头健壮的农场动物。而且，这确实在一段时间内起到了作用。  +

接下来，*路易十四废除了《南特敕令》（Edict of Nantes），通过这种方式，他从天主教会手中夺走了权力。*《南特敕令》是由亨利四世（Henry IV）颁布的，在法国为那里的"新教"少数派建立了几乎前所未有的宗教宽容程度。路易十四认为，对于一个渴望绝对权力的人来说，一个其人民不都符合他自己宗教信仰（即天主教）的国家，可不是什么好现象。在取消对胡格诺派（Huguenots）的保护后，成千上万的胡格诺派迁移到了更宽容的国家，这使得法国失去了很大一部分商人阶级。此外，路易十四基本上使自己成为了法国天主教会的领袖，这融合了法国人民的政治和宗教忠诚。  +

最后，**路易十四通过军事扩张来巩固权力。**我们一会儿会详细讨论路易十四的战争，但现在，让我先提一下这些战争的资金来源。为了给路易十四无休止的战争提供资金，他的财政大臣让 - 巴蒂斯特·科尔贝根据"重商主义（mercantilist）政策"塑造了法国经济，这意味着他在法国各地颁布了高额关税，并确保法国的出口大于进口。这一举措减少了法国的债务。它还为国内产业注入了新的活力，扩大了法国的殖民地版图，并创造了有利的贸易平衡。但是，尽管科尔贝做了很多好事，路易十四的战争几乎抵消了这些成果。  +

好的，现在另一个你应该了解的专制统治者, 是俄罗斯的彼得大帝（Peter the Great of Russia）。在1682年彼得成为沙皇（tsar）时，俄罗斯在社会和政治组织方面, 仍然遵循中世纪的标准。西方的其他欧洲国家已经采用了新的技术, 以及新的教育和金融方法，而俄罗斯在一种封建主义社会中落后了。所以彼得前往一些西方国家，看看他们是怎么做的，回国后他坚信俄罗斯必须西方化，否则就会被西欧国家超越。  +

所以，彼得推出了一些改革措施，使俄罗斯现代化，同时将权力集中在自己手中。首先，彼得进行了政治改革。他要求贵族在军队或民政管理部门服役。**有一系列被称为 “官阶表”（Table of Ranks）的等级制度，贵族们可以在其中晋升，**这意味着专家最终会处于高位。对彼得来说，这对现代政府至关重要，也是削弱贵族权力的关键。 +
其次，他进行了宗教改革。他重组了俄罗斯东正教会（Russian Orthodox Church），废除了牧首（patriarch，有点像东正教会的教皇）的角色，取而代之的是神圣宗教会议（Holy Synod），彼得安排了一些官员和牧师来执行他的命令。 +
第三，彼得进行了文化改革，也就是说，他试图塑造俄罗斯文化，使其符合西欧的形象。为此，彼得要求贵族们穿西方的服装并刮掉胡子。如果你拒绝刮胡子，你就得支付胡子税。所以不用说，彼得不会认可我海姆勒这样的人。就是这样。  +

为了实施所有这些改革，彼得将税收提高了三倍，这意味着大多数贵族和农民都厌恶彼得的改革。即便如此，彼得使俄罗斯西方化的努力, 使这个国家融入了欧洲发展的主流，并且这一进程在他的继任者叶卡捷琳娜大帝（Catherine the Great）时期得以延续。  +

**尽管许多君主都在走向"专制主义"，但也有几个重要的例外，**我认为我们现在应该谈谈这些例外，也**就是英国和荷兰。**首先是英国。当法国、普鲁士、奥地利和俄罗斯都在走向专制主义时，*#英国却朝着"立宪主义"（constitutionalism）的方向发展。立宪主义意味着政府将受到法治的限制，换句话说，君主必须与代表机构分享权力。在英国，这个代表机构就是议会（Parliament）。#*  +

但英国也面临一些问题，这些问题最终导致英国爆发了一场内战，以解决"君主拥有多少权力"的问题，这场内战就是从1642年, 持续到1651年的"英国内战"（English Civil War）。第一个原因是"君权神授"（divine right of kings）的教义。这个理念在整个欧洲越来越受欢迎，在这一时期也渗透到了英国。伊丽莎白一世（Elizabeth I）去世后没有继承人，詹姆斯一世（James I）继承了她的王位。他认为君主是上帝在地球上的代表，因此对他权力的任何限制都是对上帝权力的冒犯。换句话说，国王代表着耶稣本人，没有人能从耶稣那里夺走权力。但对他来说不幸的是，*英国在1215年制定了那个"讨厌的"《大宪章》（Magna Carta），它创立了英国议会，并赋予议会对金钱的控制权，因此防止了任何国王行使绝对权力。*  +

好的，然后查理一世（Charles I）继承了詹姆斯一世的王位，并继承了他父亲的"君权神授"信仰。他们认为，既然他们是上帝的代表，例如，财产可以为了王室的利益而被夺取，并且不受惩罚。这当然导致了君主和议会之间的严重紧张关系，特别是**下议院**（House of Commons），他们喜欢**提醒国王，英国的传统, 禁止在没有正当法律程序的情况下夺取任何人的财产。**对此，国王回应说：“如果我相信那种说法，那不是很可笑吗？” 所以，君权神授的信仰在这一时期确实在英国引发了紧张局势。  +

*内战的第二个原因是经济方面的。查理一世对议会更加不满，因为英国在经历了三十年战争*（Thirty Years' War，我们在上一个单元中谈到过）**后, 面临经济困境，**并且需要组建一支军队来抵御爱尔兰的叛乱。他和他的父亲在没有"议会"监督的情况下, 花费了大量的钱，**而议会一直试图控制这些奢侈的君主的开支。查理一世在1629年为了避免这些限制而采取的解决办法, 是拒绝召集"议会"开会，**这样议会就无法打扰他了。这很简单。**但为了镇压苏格兰的叛乱，查理一世在1640年被迫召集议会开会，这个议会被称为"长期议会"（Long Parliament）。##这个议会通过了《三年法案》（Triennial Act），该法案迫使国王至少每三年召集"议会"开会一次，##从而对国王的权力进行了更多限制。**所以紧张局势再次加剧。  +

内战的第三个原因，并不奇怪，是宗教方面的。英国国教会（Church of England）是在新教运动不断发展的时期, 由亨利八世（Henry VIII）建立的。然而，尽管在神学方面发生了一些重大变化，英国国教会（也被称为安立甘宗，Anglican Church）保留了许多天主教教会的做法和结构，比如主教和牧师的等级制度。然而，教会中一个日益壮大的少数派，即清教徒（Puritans），对这些天主教的遗留问题感到不满，他们想通过清除所有这些罗马天主教的痕迹来净化教会。詹姆斯一世拒绝屈服于他们的要求，查理一世甚至娶了一位天主教徒。不！哦，是的。总之，这三个现实, 导致了国王和议会之间的严重紧张关系，1642年，英国内战爆发了。  +

本质上，这是国王、议会和其他精英之间, 关于他们在政治结构中各自角色的冲突。**经过三年的战斗，议会的"新模范军"（New Model Army）战胜了国王的军队。**然而，查理一世拒绝认输，在这个时候，**下议院的一名清教徒，也就是奥利弗·克伦威尔（Oliver Cromwell）站了出来，领导议会军对抗国王，并取得了决定性的胜利。之后，克伦威尔驱逐了所有反对他的议会议员，剩下的议员被称为残余议会（Rump Parliament）。残余议会随后以叛国罪审判查理一世，判定他有罪，并毫不犹豫地砍掉了他的头。**女士们，先生们，*这就是英国废除君主制的方式。*  +

但需要明确的是，克伦威尔是一个因权力而变得酩酊大醉的统治者的典型例子。**他通过战争的意图, 是在英国建立一个"共和国"，但实际上，他建立了一个独裁政权。他没有给予人民他们认为自己为之战斗的权利，而是将所有权力集中在自己手中，**从这个意义上说，他符合马基雅维利（Machiavelli）对一个不惜一切代价维护权力的领导者的定义。  +

好的，现在让我们谈谈"英国内战"的后果。**由于这场战争，英国在奥利弗·克伦威尔的领导下成为了一个真正的"共和国"，被称为"护国公政体"（Protectorate），克伦威尔被称为护国公（Lord Protector）。#虽然名义上英国现在是一个"共和国"，但实际上，它是由克伦威尔领导的"军事独裁政权"。#**人民对这种安排不太满意，尤其是因为作为清教徒，克伦威尔在英国实施了约翰·加尔文（John Calvin）在日内瓦实施的那种严格的道德规则：不允许饮酒、不允许骂人、不允许跳舞。你知道，难怪他们不高兴。不管怎样，**1658年##克伦威尔去世后，护国公政体最终瓦解了。##**所以，张开你们的嘴，尽情跳舞，举杯庆祝吧。*所以到1660年，##议会恢复了君主制，##将王位交给了查理二世（Charles II），这一时期被称为复辟时期*（Restoration period）。  +

但查理二世没有实现人们的期望。他与法国密谋，并且与"议会"合作得不太好。然后詹姆斯二世（James II）在查理二世之后登上了王位，按照英国人的说法，他是个糟糕的国王。他在军队、大学和政府中, 任命了各种各样的天主教徒。不！哦，是的。所以议会意识到他们刚刚经历了一场内战，目的是让英国摆脱糟糕的国王，于是他们抵制詹姆斯二世，转而将王位提供给詹姆斯二世的女儿玛丽（Mary）和她的丈夫奥兰治的威廉（William of Orange）。当詹姆斯二世听到这个计划时，像个 “真男人” 一样逃跑了，放弃了王位，1689年，威廉和玛丽登上了王位。这种权力转移被称为"光荣革命"（Glorious Revolution），因为君主的更替没有流血（除了发生了一些叛乱和相当多的流血事件）。但**#无论如何，随着威廉和玛丽登上王位，英国的"君权神授"理念正式消亡，英国建立了真正的"君主立宪制"。#**  +

*##议会实现这一目标的一个重要手段, 是颁布了《权利法案》（English Bill of Rights），其中规定, 由"议会"征税（而不是君主），并规定, "议会"制定的法律不能被君主废除。##此外，威廉和玛丽在签署《权利法案》之前, 不被允许登上王位 (即只有他们答应这个法案, 作为交换, 才能登上君位)。*  +

好的，现在让我们谈谈**这一时期, "专制主义"的另一个例外，也就是荷兰**（Dutch）。由于荷兰位于大西洋的战略位置，安特卫普（Antwerp）这个贸易城市, 使荷兰在这一时期成为了欧洲最繁荣的国家。**在近一个世纪的时间里，这个地区一直由西班牙的"哈布斯堡"统治者（Habsburg rulers）控制，**随着荷兰越来越繁荣，西班牙的菲利普二世（Philip II of Spain）决定染指更多的财富。所以他颁布了一些政策来镇压荷兰，并将荷兰更多的财富引向西班牙王位。此外，*荷兰成为了"新教"（Protestantism）的温床，尤其是加尔文主义*（Calvinist）的新教，随着新教的发展，菲利普二世（他当然是天主教徒）对荷兰人的不服从越来越感到沮丧。当荷兰"新教"煽动者, 开始破坏和亵渎荷兰各地的天主教堂时，菲利普二世毫不犹豫地派遣军队镇压叛乱，最终以叛国罪处死了成千上万的荷兰新教徒。就在这时，**#新教领袖奥兰治的威廉（William of Orange）崛起，领导荷兰"新教徒"摆脱了西班牙的影响。#**等等，奥兰治的威廉？这不就是在内战后在英国掌权的那个人吗？确实是同一个人，但在他成为英国国王之前，他是荷兰共和国（Dutch Republic）的国家元首。  +

**"荷兰共和国"在1648年的《威斯特伐利亚和约》（Peace of Westphalia）中正式成立，**该和约除了结束三十年战争外，还结束了荷兰和西班牙之间的八十年战争。因此，荷兰共和国成为了欧洲最富有的商业帝国。他们在一段时间内主导了大西洋世界的贸易，并且在印度洋贸易中也占据了很大的份额。**#新独立的荷兰没有设立国王，而是建立了一个寡头政治（oligarchy），本质上是由一小群人统治的政府。在这种情况下，寡头政治由城市绅士和富裕的地主组成，他们代表荷兰的各个省份，共同组成了"联省议会"（States General），并决定国内外政策问题。而且你不能把"联省议会"看作是像英国那样在一定程度上的"代议制政府"。组成"联省议会"的人是社会精英，他们通常通过一些符合自身利益的政策。#**即便如此，英国和荷兰在这一时期作为欧洲不走向专制主义的例子而与众不同。  +

好的，我们一直在谈论这一时期权力, 是如何转移和重新分配的，但现在让我们从更广泛的欧洲层面谈谈权力问题。正如你从上一个单元中了解到的，**#《威斯特伐利亚和约》有效地结束了欧洲的"宗教战争"时期。在这一时期之前，宗教是各国开战的一个主要因素，但在《威斯特伐利亚和约》之后，战争的主要原因, 是维护欧洲微妙的权力平衡(即维持"势力均衡")。#**权力平衡, 就是不断追求确保欧洲大陆上的所有国家, 在权力上或多或少是平等的(势均力敌的)，这样就没有一个国家能够主宰整个大陆。  +

现在你需要了解一些关于这种"对权力平衡的追求"是如何实现的例子，所以让我们从波兰的瓜分开始说起。权力平衡的理念决定了波兰的命运，基本上让波兰从地图上消失了大约150年。波兰本身是一个"君主立宪制"国家，但它充满了弱点。拥有土地的贵族剥削农民，并且习惯于违抗国王。此外，他们没有像英国那样强大的官僚机构来统一国家，并且几十年来一直因战争而被削弱。除此之外，波兰被专制国家包围，即俄罗斯、普鲁士和奥地利，任何有能力的专制统治者, 都能像鲨鱼闻到血腥味一样察觉到波兰的弱点。  +

这三个国家之间的权力平衡, 最初因为"俄罗斯对奥斯曼帝国的胜利"而失衡，这使得俄罗斯在中欧地区成为更强大的国家。所以**奥地利和普鲁士决定提出一个外交解决方案，而不是与俄罗斯开战：“但是波兰就在我们中间，它很虚弱，那我们把波兰瓜分了，这样就不用打仗也能维持权力平衡，怎么样？**” 从1772年开始，大约用了25年的时间，波兰最终被这三个敌对国家吞并，从地图上消失了。但是，这样"权力平衡"就恢复了，对吧？  +

好的，对"权力平衡"的追求, 还导致了什么呢？嗯，**对权力平衡的需求日益增加，这使得各国不得不相互开战, 并扩充军备。**例如，让我们谈谈1683年的维也纳之战（Battle of Vienna）。17世纪的奥斯曼帝国非常庞大，在东南欧拥有领土，并且他们有野心进一步向中欧推进。他们试图在"维也纳之战"中入侵奥地利，以确保沿着多瑙河有更好的贸易路线。为了阻止这种扩张, 并维护权力平衡，奥地利哈布斯堡王朝、波兰（在被瓜分之前）和神圣罗马帝国联合起来, 成功地阻止了入侵。随着"权力平衡"的恢复，这场战斗标志着奥斯曼帝国向欧洲扩张的结束。  +

哦，还记得我之前提到的路易十四的战争吗？现在让我们详细谈谈他。**路易十四非常渴望获得权力和领土，**为了在法国领土和他的王朝, 以及其他战略王朝中获得利益，**他几乎不停地发动战争。**他发动了荷兰战争（Dutch War），试图在西属尼德兰（Spanish Netherlands）获得领土, 并削弱哈布斯堡王朝，但最终没有成功。他还在1702年至1713年参与了"西班牙王位继承战争"（War of Spanish Succession），以追求他自己的王朝利益。当西班牙的查理二世（Charles II of Spain）去世时，安排菲利普五世（Philip V）继承王位，但有趣的是，菲利普实际上是路易十四的孙子。这里面的阴谋更多了。  +

**几个欧洲国家担心这种安排，因为这意味着法国和西班牙有可能联合起来，**由同一个王位统治，也就是路易十四的王位。考虑到每个国家广泛的殖民领地，这将决定性地使权力平衡向法国和西班牙倾斜，那么谁能与他们抗衡呢？**所以战争立即爆发，以阻止这种情况发生。**所以英国、联合省（United Provinces）、奥地利和普鲁士, 与法国、西班牙和巴伐利亚作战。记住，**这场战争不是宗教战争，而是为了防止一个国家（在这种情况下是法国）获得过多权力，从而破坏欧洲的权力平衡。**记住这一点至关重要。  +

嗯，战争在1713年随着《乌得勒支和约》（Treaty of Utrecht）结束，这个和约做了很多事情，但就我们的目的而言，我们只需要指出该和约规定菲利普五世将继续坐在西班牙王位上，但法国和西班牙必须保持独立实体。所以《乌得勒支和约》维护了欧洲的权力平衡。  +

好的，第三，**对权力平衡的追求, 导致欧洲国家扩充军备，**因为，你知道，如果没有一支庞大的军队，就无法与其他欧洲国家作战。这里的关键人物是瑞典的古斯塔夫·阿道夫（Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden）。随着阿道夫建立了一支庞大的职业常备军，并在三十年战争（Thirty Years' War）中大力部署，小型民兵组织变得过时了。这些军队高度组织化，等级分明，权威等级清晰。此外，**新的军事技术得到了发展，**从火器到移动大炮再到更复杂的防御工事。但**为了为这一切提供资金，阿道夫不得不提高税收, 并扩大官僚机构，**以保持一切井然有序。其他欧洲领导人看到瑞典军队后心想：“哎呀，我也得有这样一支军队”，路易十四尤其如此。这种军事扩充, 对"权力平衡"产生了重大影响 (*#就是军备竞赛, 越竞争越导致君主专制的权力做大#*)。那些以我刚才提到的方式扩充军备的国家, 在"权力平衡"中占据了优势。  +

好的，现在是时候谈谈农业了，因为在**这一时期，农业经历了一些重大创新，**总的来说，这被称为农业革命（Agricultural Revolution）。它始于英国和荷兰的低地国家，奇怪的是：**越来越多的人搬到城市, 从事工业工作。**例如，回想一下第一单元的**圈地运动（enclosure movement），它逐渐减少了农民可使用的土地数量，这使得很多农民前往城市寻找工作。但是，即使农民数量减少了，欧洲各地的农业产量几乎增加了两倍。**这是怎么发生的呢？很高兴你问这个问题。  +

还记得上一时期的农业创新吗，其中最重要的是三田制（three-field system），这是一件大事。但即便如此，三分之一的土地每年都必须休耕，以便补充土壤的养分。但在这一时期，为了补充土壤养分，人们开发了一项新的创新。**农民们发现，他们可以将"消耗土壤养分"的谷物作物, 与能"恢复土壤养分"的其他作物, 交替种植，**比如土豆和三叶草。**现在田地可以在没有每年"休耕期"的情况下生产作物。**这极大地增加了食物供应和其他农产品的产量。  +

此外，这一时期引入了几项新的农业技术，我现在要告诉你其中的三项。首先是杰思罗·塔尔（Jethro Tull）发明的条播机（seed drill），它确保种子以精确的间隔种植，并覆盖上泥土。另一项创新是机械锄头，它提高了清除土壤中杂草的效率。第三是铸铁犁，它除了能更有效地开垦种植用的犁沟外，其部件可以互换，便于修理和更快地制造。  +

此外，美洲作物的交流（Columbian Exchange）也促进了粮食产量的增加，我们在第一单元谈到过这一点。对农民来说，**土豆是关键食物之一，**它非常有营养, 且种植成本低廉。事实上，**半英亩的土豆, 可以养活一个家庭一整年。**随着像牛油果、豆类和南瓜等新食物的引入，欧洲人的饮食更加多样化，这导致了更好的健康状况和更长的寿命。  +

当然，如果不谈论经济发展，对1648年至1815年欧洲的讨论就不完整，我说得对吧？你知道我是对的。所以让我们从实际的经济转变开始讲起，然后从国家的角度来看待这些转变。在这一时期，**劳动力和贸易越来越摆脱了"政府"和"企业实体"施加的传统限制，**这种情况在英国最为显著。例如，**在这一时期之前，只有加入"行会"（guild）的工人才能获得报酬，**而行会有自己的权力结构。**行会通常控制价格, 并使其居高不下 (如同形成价格联盟?)，**这对精英阶层有利，而不是对工人有利。随着英国羊毛产业（从中世纪就存在）的兴起和转型，英国制造商开始直接向工人支付工资，这限制了行会的影响力。这进一步提高了工人的工资，因为他们按件计酬，所以有很大的动力提高生产力。  +

好的，现在让我们谈谈许多工人劳动的背景，也就是"家庭手工业"（cottage industry）。*在工业革命*（Industrial Revolution，我们将在下一单元详细讨论）**中, 工厂成为主导的制造模式之前，供购买的商品, 主要是在人们的家中生产的。这就是为什么我们称其为家庭手工业。它也被称为"外放制"（putting-out system）。商人和企业家会购买原材料，然后向各种人支付工资，让他们将原材料加工成成品。**例如，商人会购买原棉或羊毛，然后向纺纱工、织布工和染工支付工资，他们会生产出成品纺织品，然后在市场上销售。这个系统为下一个世纪的工业化奠定了基础，并且**这个系统增加了工人的数量，特别是在农村村庄，他们可以通过劳动赚钱来养家糊口。**  +

**这种市场经济的增长, 导致对"制成品"的需求不断增加，这意味着人们推动将制造业, 从"家庭"转移到被称为"工厂"的新建筑中。**同样，我们将在下一单元详细讨论这个问题，所以我在这里只是简要提及。工厂的最初形式, 主要是生产纺织品，也就是说他们制造布料制品。这些工厂由流动的水驱动，这就是为什么它们必须建在河流和溪流附近，理查德·阿克莱特（Richard Arkwright）的水力纺纱机（water frame）就是这方面的一项重要发明。它是一个由流动的水驱动的轮子，然后可以为制造布料和服装的机器提供动力。在工厂里，工人在工作中变得越来越专业化，不再是一个人从头到尾生产一件可销售的商品(变得能流水线操作了)。但就像我说的，家庭手工业为这一切奠定了基础。在家庭手工业中，商人会把他们的商品, 从一组工人手中, 送到另一组工人手中：这个房子的人会织布，那个房子的人会染布，如此等等。在工厂里，这种劳动分工更加细化，所有这些因素共同导致了对制成纺织品的需求激增。  +

**市场经济的增长, 也导致了新的"金融实践"和"机构"的出现。**例如，这一时期"保险业"（insurance industry）兴起。保险公司会收取每月的保费，如果发生像火灾摧毁工厂这样的灾难性事件，保险公司会弥补企业家的损失。有了这种保障，企业家，尤其是在英国的企业家，有信心将大量资金投入到工厂和不断增加的待售商品库存中。此外，我们还看到了"风险资本"领域的"专业银行"的兴起。在1750年之前，如果一个企业家想要建造一个工厂，例如，他们必须向家人借钱或者自己拥有财富。但是随着工厂系统的兴起，商业活动激增，专业银行出现了，它们保留人们存入的一部分钱，并将其余的钱作为风险资本（venture capital）贷出，收取利息。风险资本，以防你不知道，就像它听起来的那样：如果你有一个你想尝试的项目（比如创业或建造工厂），那么这个银行可以借给你资金（也就是启动资金）来完成它。  +

好的，这就是经济变化在实际层面的表现，所以现在让我们从国家层面, 看看国家是如何经历经济变化的。在**这一时期，欧洲人越来越多地控制了世界经济，**正如我们已经谈到的，对世界经济的这种控制, 对农业革命（Agricultural Revolution）和消费革命（Consumer Revolution，我们将在下一单元讨论）等事件做出了重大贡献。但**问题是：他们是如何主导世界经济的呢？嗯，各国仍然扎根于"重商主义"（mercantilist）政策。**记住，**重商主义是一种由国家驱动的经济体系。**主要目标是通过保持有利的贸易平衡, 来增加国家的金银储备，也就是说出口大于进口。你可以看到这种政策在法国的表现，例如路易十四的财政大臣让 - 巴蒂斯特·科尔贝（Jean-Baptiste Colbert）就推行了这样的政策。还要记住，**重商主义政策的一个关键驱动因素, 是"殖民地"的建立。**为什么呢？因为殖民地不仅是其宗主国原材料的宝贵来源，而且住在殖民地的人, 还可以购买用这些原材料生产的制成品。**在这一时期的大约一半时间里，重商主义开始让位于资本主义。**但目前，重商主义政策与专制主义的政治趋势相契合。  +

但是欧洲开始主导世界经济在很大程度上是因为对新世界产品（如糖、大米和棉花）的需求增加。这种需求的增加意味着殖民地种植园主需要更多的劳动力来收割他们的作物。由于欧洲的疾病，当地的劳动力迅速死亡或者逃跑，欧洲种植园主越来越多地转向非洲奴隶劳动力来耕种他们的土地。这增加了欧洲大部分地区的食物供应。正如我之前提到的，这些非洲人被从他们的家中抓走，被迫登上奴隶船，然后忍受残酷的“中间航程”（Middle Passage），船上的空间只够他们趴着。这些被奴役的非洲人忍受着数周甚至数月的疾病和残酷待遇，最终到达种植园，那里的条件同样恶劣。  +

奴隶贸易是一个更大的贸易体系的一部分，这个贸易体系被称为三角贸易（triangular trade）。猜猜这些贸易路线像什么形状？三角形？猜对了。就是我从镜头这边说的。贸易循环是这样的：商人从非洲西海岸购买奴隶劳动力，然后他们带着这些奴隶穿越大西洋（中间航程），在加勒比地区用他们换取糖和糖蜜，然后航行到北美的大西洋殖民地，用糖和糖蜜换取朗姆酒，然后再重复这个过程。  +

现在，由于奴隶劳动力使价格保持在低位，这种全球贸易极大地促进了欧洲消费文化的发展。换句话说，因为价格低廉，更多的人购买更多的东西。例如，他们购买糖（曾经被认为是奢侈品），购买用棉花和丝绸制成的纺织品，烟草贸易也成为了一个庞大的产业，因为没有那些“伟大的肺之飞镖”（指烟草），和朋友共度的夜晚又怎么能算完整呢？  +

All right, you're here for a review of Unit 3 of AP European History, so let's get to it. Get them brain cows ready for milking because we ain't got no time to waste. Now the title of this unit tells you what it's all about: absolutism and constitutionalism. These are two new innovations on government that are going to dominate Europe during this period. So the question is: which states will become absolutist and which states will become constitutional, and why?

Intrigue and everything we talked about in the last unit sets the stage for these innovations in government. In that unit, states were working to centralize power, and the Reformation and the Wars of Religion helped states along that road by merging political and religious authorities and providing common enemies to unite against. And as a result, those states would go one of two ways in this unit: absolutism or constitutionalism. And I reckon we ought to start with absolutism.

Okay, one of the major political shifts during this period was the shift towards absolutism in European monarchies, and that's exactly what it sounds like. Absolutism describes how monarchs consolidated all state power under themselves in order to advance the needs of their own state. Now remember that prior to this period, power was distributed among monarchs, nobles, and the church. But during this period, monarchs looked around at each other and said, "Hey, y'all want all the power?" To which they responded, "Absolutely monarchical power." Joke. Nailed it.

Anyway, let's consider a couple of factors that led to the rise of absolutist states. First, there was the weakened influence of the Catholic Church due to a growing acceptance and tolerance of Protestant practice and a lack of interest in religious warfare after the Peace of Westphalia. Second, merchant classes were expanding rapidly during this period of global trade, and in some measure they desired absolute monarchs for the economic and political stability they could provide. Additionally, this meant that power was shifting away from landed nobility into the hands of this new merchant class.

So when I mentioned earlier that power was shared between three entities, look at what's happening now: the power of the nobility is waning, and so is the power of the church, and who's left? Monarchs. And their power is only going to increase during this period.

Now you're going to need to know some examples of these absolutist rulers, and the poster boy for absolutism is and always will be Louis XIV of France. He was fond of saying "L'état, c'est moi," which when being translated means, "I am the state." In other words, he saw himself in his own person as the highest and only authority for France.

Now while Louis was still a child, events were unfolding in France that would enable him to become that all-powerful monarch that he eventually became, and these events collectively are known as the Fronde. This was a rebellion of French nobles against Cardinal Mazarin, who was ruling France at the time when Louis was only a child. As Mazarin consolidated power in a centralized state, therefore diminishing the power of the nobles, that was just too much for them. The short story is that the Fronde threw France into chaos, and Mazarin ultimately prevailed. But the key takeaway was this: the vast majority of French people realized that they needed to have a strong ruler to protect them from each other and from living in chaos. So when Louis finally comes of age and is all like, "I am the state," the people are ready for such a development.

Now those words would mean absolutely nothing if Louis couldn't back it up by actually ruling absolutely, and he did that in the following ways. With the help of his finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Louis XIV introduced several reforms that helped consolidate power under his throne. First was the intendant system. Louis sent bureaucratic agents called intendants into the various districts of France who acted as avatars of Louis himself. As such, whatever policies Louis passed, his intendant would make sure that they were obeyed throughout France. Now this undermined the authority of local governors and, more to the point, the nobility, and made sure all parts of Louis's kingdom were made to obey his will. So if you lived under Louis's rule and he imposed a law and you were like, "Ah, the king lives all the way over there, I'll never know whether I obey or not," well, you're probably going to go ahead and get your head chopped off because the king was there in effect through his intendants.

Through all of these actions, Louis was steadily consolidating power under himself and away from local administrators and nobles. Another way Louis consolidated power was in the construction of the Palace of Versailles (or if you live in the American South like I do, "Versailles"). Anyway, in order to undermine the authority of the nobles, he had many of them relocated into his own palace at Versailles. There he could keep an eye on them and demand their loyalty. I mean, it's awfully difficult to do anything to undermine the king's power when you live in his house. In order to keep the nobility from thinking too much about losing their power, Louis threw parties on the regular and pushed enough alcohol on them to kill a stout farm animal. And you know, it actually worked for a while.

Next, Louis revoked the Edict of Nantes, and in this way, Louis took power away from the Catholic Church. The Edict of Nantes was put in place by Henry IV and established an almost unheard-of degree of religious tolerance in France for the Protestant minority living there. Louis decided that to have a state whose people did not all conform to his own religious beliefs (which is to say Catholicism) wasn't a good look for a man who desired absolute power. And in removing protection for the Huguenots, hundreds of thousands of them migrated to more tolerant states, robbing France of a healthy portion of their merchant class. Additionally, Louis essentially made himself the head of the Catholic Church in France, which merged political and religious loyalties of the French population.

And finally, Louis worked to consolidate power through military expansion. Now we'll talk more about Louis's wars in a moment, but for now, let me just mention how they were paid for. In order to finance Louis's endless wars, his finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert shaped the French economy according to mercantilist policies, which meant that he enacted steep tariffs throughout France and made sure that they were exporting more than they were importing. And this had the effect of decreasing France's debt. It also breathed new life into domestic industries, expanded France's colonial holdings, and created a favorable balance of trade. But despite all the good work Colbert did, Louis's wars undid most of it.

Okay, now another absolutist ruler you should know is Peter the Great of Russia. By the time Peter became tsar in 1682, Russia was still socially and politically organized according to medieval standards. Other European nations in the west had adopted new technology and new methods of education and finance, while Russia lagged behind in a sort of feudalistic society. So Peter went on a little trip to some of these western nations to see how they did things and returned home convinced that Russia had to westernize or else be overtaken by the western European states.

And so here are some of the reforms Peter introduced to modernize Russia while at the same time consolidating power under himself. First, Peter introduced political reform. He required nobles to serve in the army or the civil administration. There was a series of ranks called the Table of Ranks that nobles could move through, which meant that experts ended up on top. And to Peter, this was both essential to a modern government and the key to reducing the power of the nobility. Second, he introduced religious reform. He reorganized the Russian Orthodox Church by eliminating the role of patriarch (which was kind of like the pope of the Orthodox Church) and replaced it with the Holy Synod, which Peter populated with officials and ministers who would do Peter's bidding. And third, Peter introduced cultural reforms, which is to say he tried to shape the Russian culture to fit the image of western Europe. To that end, Peter required nobles to wear western clothing and shave their beards. If you refused to shave your beard, you had to pay a beard tax. So needless to say, Peter would not approve of your boy Heimler. There you go.

Now in order to pull off all these innovations, Peter tripled taxes, and that meant that most of the nobles and peasantry despised Peter's reforms. Even so, Peter's work to westernize Russia brought the nation into the mainstream of European development, and that process was continued through his later successor, Catherine the Great.

Now even though many monarchs were moving towards absolutism, there were a couple of significant exceptions, and I reckon we ought to talk about them now, namely the English and the Dutch. First, the English. As France, Prussia, Austria, and Russia were all moving towards absolutism, England was moving in the opposite direction towards constitutionalism. Now constitutionalism means that the government would be limited by the rule of law, or to put it another way, the monarch had to share power with a representative body. And in the case of England, that would be the Parliament.

But there was some trouble on the horizon which would eventually lead England into a civil war to settle just how much power the monarch would have, and that would be the English Civil War, which lasted from 1642 to 1651. The first cause was the doctrine of the divine right of kings. This idea was gaining traction throughout Europe and during this period it bled into England as well. After Elizabeth I died without an heir, James I succeeded her. He believed that the monarch was God's representative on earth and therefore any curtailment of his power is an affront to God's own power. In other words, the king represents Jesus himself, and ain't nobody taking away power from Jesus. But unfortunately for him, England had created that pesky Magna Carta in 1215, which created the English Parliament and gave it control over the money and thus prevented any king from wielding absolute power.

Okay, so then Charles I succeeded James and inherited this divine right belief from his father. They believed that since they were representatives of God, property, for example, could be taken for the throne with immunity. This of course led to significant tensions between the monarchs and the Parliament, specifically the House of Commons, who liked to remind the king that English traditions forbade anyone's property from being taken from them except through the due process of law. To which the king responded, "Wouldn't that be hilarious if I believed that?" So that belief in the divine right of kings is for sure causing tension in England during this time.

The second cause of the war was economic. Now Charles grew further embittered against Parliament because of the economic troubles England faced after having fought the Thirty Years' War (which we talked about in the last unit) and the need to raise an army to fend off an Irish rebellion as well. He and his father spent metric buttloads of money without oversight from Parliament, who was always trying to rein in the spending of these extravagant monarchs. And the solution Charles came up with in 1629 to avoid those restrictions was to refuse to call Parliament into session, and therefore they couldn't bother him. Easy peasy lemon squeezy. But in order to crush the rebellion in Scotland, Charles was forced to call Parliament into session in 1640, and it became known as the Long Parliament. This Parliament passed the Triennial Act, which forced the king to call Parliament into session at least once every three years, thus creating more limits on the power of the king. And so the tension was revived.

The third cause of the war was, not surprisingly, religion. Now the Church of England was established by Henry VIII during the growing movement of Protestantism. However, despite some significant changes in theology, the Anglican Church (which is another way of saying the Church of England) retained quite a few practices and structures from the Catholic Church, like the hierarchy of bishops and priests. However, a growing minority in the church known as the Puritans were getting a little saucy about these Catholic holdovers and wanted to purify the church by ridding it of all these vestiges of Roman Catholicism. James I refused to bow to their demands, and Charles I went so far as to marry a Catholic. No! Oh yeah. Anyway, those three realities were causing significant tension between the king and Parliament, and in 1642, the English Civil War began.

Essentially, it was a conflict between the king, Parliament, and other elites over their respective roles in the political structure. After three years of fighting, the Parliament's New Model Army was victorious over the king's army. However, Charles I refused to concede, and at this point, a member of the House of Commons who also happened to be a Puritan, namely Oliver Cromwell, rose up and led the parliamentary army against the king and won a decisive victory. Afterward, Cromwell kicked out any members of Parliament who opposed him, and those representatives that were left were known as the Rump Parliament. The Rump Parliament then tried Charles I for treason, found him guilty, and went ahead and cut his head off. And that is how you abolish kingship in England, ladies and gentlemen.

But just to be clear, Cromwell is a great example of a ruler who got slap drunk with power. His intent through the war was to create a commonwealth in England, but in reality, he created a dictatorship. He didn't give the people the rights that they thought they'd been fighting for, but instead consolidated all the power under himself, and in that way, he fit Machiavelli's definition of a leader who held on to power at all costs.

Okay, now let's talk about the consequences of the English Civil War. As a result of this war, England became a true republic called the Protectorate under the leadership of Oliver Cromwell, who was named Lord Protector. And though in word England was now a republic, in reality, it was ruled as a military dictatorship with Cromwell at the head. The people were none too happy with this arrangement, not least because as a Puritan, Cromwell imposed the same kind of strict moralistic rules upon England that John Calvin imposed in Geneva: no drinking, no swearing, no dancing. You know, no wonder they weren't happy. Anyway, the Protectorate ended up falling apart after Cromwell's death in 1658. So you know, get them filthy mouths out, strike up and dance, and raise a glass. So by 1660, Parliament restored the monarchy, giving the throne to Charles II, and this became known as the Restoration period.

But Charles II did not fulfill their hopes. He schemed with France and didn't work well with Parliament. Then James II came to power after Charles II, and he was kind of a turd by English reckoning. He appointed all kinds of Catholics to important positions in the army and universities and the government. No! Oh yeah. So Parliament, realizing that they had just fought a civil war to rid England of turd kings, resisted James and instead offered the throne to James's daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange. And when James heard of this plan, like a real man, he fled, abdicating his throne, and William and Mary rose to power in 1689. This transfer of power was known as the Glorious Revolution because monarchs were changed without bloodshed (except that there were quite a few rebellions and quite a bit of bloodshed). But regardless, with the ascension of William and Mary to the throne, the idea of the divine right of kings in England was officially put to death, and England had established a true constitutional monarchy.

And a significant means by which Parliament did this was by enacting the English Bill of Rights, which included provisions for Parliament to levy taxes (not the monarch) and stipulated that when Parliament made a law, it could not be annulled by the monarch. Additionally, William and Mary were not allowed to assume the throne until they signed the Bill of Rights.

Okay, now let's talk about the other exception to absolutism during this period, namely the Dutch. Now because of their strategic location on the Atlantic, the trading city of Antwerp led the Dutch to become the most prosperous state in Europe during this period. For almost a century, the region had been controlled by the Habsburg rulers in Spain, and as the Dutch grew increasingly prosperous, Philip II of Spain decided to get his inbred hands on more of that wealth. So he enacted policies that would clamp down on the Netherlands and direct more of their wealth to the Spanish throne. Furthermore, the Netherlands had become a hotbed of Protestantism, especially the Calvinist flavor, and as it grew, Philip (who was of course a Catholic) became more and more frustrated at their lack of obedience. And when Dutch Protestant agitators began destroying and desecrating Catholic churches across the Netherlands, Philip went ahead and sent an army to squash the rebellion and ended up killing thousands of Dutch Protestants on charges of treason. That's when Protestant leader William of Orange rose to leadership and led the Dutch Protestants in ridding the Netherlands of Spanish influence. Wait, William of Orange? Isn't that the guy who came to power in England after the civil war? It is indeed the same guy, but before he was king in England, he was head of state in the Dutch Republic.

Now the Dutch Republic was officially formed by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which in addition to ending the Thirty Years' War also ended the Eighty Years' War between the Dutch and the Spanish. As a result of this, the Dutch Republic emerged as the wealthiest European commercial empire. They led in trade in the Atlantic world for a time and had a large footprint in the Indian Ocean trade as well. Now the newly independent Dutch did not install a king but rather established an oligarchy, which is essentially a government ruled by a small group of people. In this case, the oligarchy was made up of the urban gentry and wealthy landowners, which represented each province of the Netherlands, and together they made up the States General and decided questions of foreign and domestic policy. And you can't think of the States General as if it were a representative government like they had to some degree in England. The men who made up the States General were elite members of society and typically passed policies that served their own best interests. Even so, the British and the Dutch stand apart during this period as examples of European countries that did not go the way of absolutism.

Okay, we've been talking about how power has shifted and been reallocated during this period, but now let's talk about power on a broader European scale. Now as you know from the last unit, the Peace of Westphalia effectively ended the period of religious wars in Europe. Religion was a major factor in why states went to war prior to this period, but after Westphalia, the main reason wars occurred was to maintain the delicate balance of power in Europe. And the balance of power was the constant pursuit of making sure that all nations in the continent were more or less equal in power, and that way no one nation can dominate the entire continent.

Now you'll need to know a few examples of how this pursuit of the balance of power worked out, so let's start with the partition of Poland. This idea of the balance of power sealed the fate of Poland and essentially wiped it off the map for about 150 years. Poland itself was a constitutional monarchy, but it was riddled with weaknesses. The landed nobles exploited the peasantry and made a habit of defying the king. Additionally, they did not have a robust bureaucracy like Britain to unite the country, and they had been weakened by almost constant war for decades. Add to that, Poland was surrounded by absolute states, namely Russia, Prussia, and Austria, and any absolutist worth his or her salt can smell weakness like a shark can smell blood in the water.

Now the balance of power between these three nations was initially unbalanced by Russia's victories against the Ottoman Empire, which made Russia the stronger nation in the central European sphere. So instead of going to war against Russia, Austria and Prussia decided to propose a diplomatic solution: "But Poland sits right here in the middle of us. They're weak, so how about we just divide Poland up between us and maintain the balance of power without having to fight about it?" It took about 25 years starting in 1772, but eventually Poland was annexed into these three rival powers and disappeared from the map. But you know, it's okay because the balance of power was restored, right?

Okay, what else did the pursuit of the balance of power cause? Well, the need for a balance of power increasingly created the need for countries to go to war with each other and expand their military. For example, let's talk about the Battle of Vienna in 1683. The Ottoman Empire was massive in the 17th century and held possessions in southeastern Europe, and they had ambitions to push further into central Europe. They attempted to invade Austria in the Battle of Vienna in order to secure better trading routes along the Danube River. In order to keep this expansion from happening and thus disrupting the balance of power, the Austrian Habsburgs, Poland (before the partition), and the Holy Roman Empire united to stop the invasion and did so successfully. With the balance of power restored, that battle marked the end of Ottoman expansion into Europe.

Oh yeah, remember when I mentioned Louis XIV's wars? Let's talk about him now. Louis XIV was pretty thirsty to gain power and territory and engaged in almost endless wars in order to make gains in French territory and his dynasty along with other strategic dynasties that increased Louis's power. He fought the Dutch War to gain territory in the Spanish Netherlands and to weaken the Habsburgs, which was ultimately unsuccessful. He also fought in the War of Spanish Succession from 1702 to 1713 to pursue his own dynastic interest. When Charles II of Spain died, it was arranged that Philip V succeed him, but the saucy part was that Philip actually was Louis XIV's grandson. More intrigue now.

Several European nations feared this arrangement because it meant that potentially France and Spain could be combined and ruled under a single throne, namely Louis XIV's throne. Now given each nation's extensive colonial holdings, this would decisively tip the balance of power towards France and Spain, and then who could stand against them? And so war immediately broke out to prevent this scenario. So England, the United Provinces, Austria, and Prussia fought against France, Spain, and Bavaria. And remember what this war was about: it wasn't a religious war but rather a war to prevent one nation (France in this case) from gaining too much power and thus upsetting the balance of power in Europe. And that is crucial to remember.

Well, the war ended in 1713 with the Treaty of Utrecht, which did a lot of things, but for our purposes, we just need to point out that the treaty stipulated that Philip V would remain on the Spanish throne but that France and Spain must remain separate entities. So the Treaty of Utrecht maintained the balance of power in Europe.

Okay, now third, the pursuit of the balance of power led European nations to expand their militaries because, you know, you just can't kill other Europeans without a sizeable army. And the key player here was Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. Small militias became obsolete as Adolphus built a massive professional standing army and deployed it mightily during the Thirty Years' War. They were highly organized into ascending ranks so that the hierarchy of authority was clear. Also, new military technology was developed, from firearms to mobile cannon to more elaborate fortifications. But in order to finance all of this, Adolphus was required to raise taxes and expand the bureaucracy in order to keep everything organized. Other European leaders looked at the Swedish army and were like, "Dang, I got to get me some of that," not least Louis XIV. And this expansion of the military affected the balance of power significantly. It was those nations who expanded their military in the ways that I just mentioned that found themselves on the winning side of the balance of power.

Okay, now it's time to talk about agriculture because during this period, farming underwent some major innovations, and taken all together, it's known as the Agricultural Revolution. It started in Britain and the Low Countries of the Netherlands, and here's the crazy thing: more and more people were moving to urban areas for industrial work. For example, recall from Unit 1 the enclosure movement, which gradually reduced the amount of land available to farmers, and that sent a lot of them to the cities looking for work. But even with fewer farmers, agricultural output nearly tripled in various places across Europe. How did that happen? So glad you asked.

Now remember the farming innovations from the last period, the most significant of which was the three-field system, and that was a big deal. But still, a third of the land had to lie fallow every year so that the soil's nutrients could be replenished. But in this period, a new innovation was developed in order to replenish the nutrients of the soil. Farmers discovered that they could alternate grain crops (which leach nutrients from the soil) with other crops that restored nutrients to the soil, like potatoes and clover. Now fields could produce crops with no yearly fallow period. This had the effect of dramatically increasing the food supply and other agricultural goods.

Additionally, this period saw the introduction of several new farming technologies, three of which I'm going to tell you about now. First was the introduction of Jethro Tull's seed drill, which made sure the seeds were planted at exact intervals and covered them over with dirt. Another innovation, the mechanical hoe, was able to increase the efficiency with which weeds were removed from the soil. And third was the cast iron plow, which in addition to digging furrows for planting more efficiently, was made with interchangeable parts that allowed for easier repair and quicker manufacturing.

Now also contributing to this increased production of food was the Columbian Exchange, which we talked about in Unit 1. One of the key foods for peasants was the potato, which was exceedingly nutritious and cheap to grow. In fact, half an acre of potatoes could feed a family all year long. And with all the new foods being introduced like avocados and beans and squashes, the diet of Europeans expanded, which led to better health and longer lifespans.

Now of course, no discussion of Europe from 1648 to 1815 would be complete without some chatter on economic developments, am I right? You know I'm right. So let's start with economic shifts on the ground, and then we'll look at them from the state perspective. So during this period, labor and trade were increasingly freed from traditional restrictions imposed by governments and corporate entities, and this occurred most dramatically in England. For example, prior to this period, workers would only be paid if they were part of a guild, which had its own authority structure. The guilds usually controlled prices and kept them high, which benefited the elite rather than the workers. With the rise and transformation of Britain's wool industry (which had been around since medieval times), British manufacturers began paying wages directly to workers, which had the effect of limiting the influence of guilds. This had the further effect of raising workers' wages because since they got paid per garment, there was a great incentive to increase productivity.

Okay, now let's talk about the context in which many of these workers were performing their labor, namely the cottage industry. Before the factory became the dominant mode of manufacturing goods in the Industrial Revolution (on which more in the next unit), goods for purchase were made mainly in people's homes. That's why we call this the cottage industry. It's also known as the putting-out system. Merchants and entrepreneurs would buy raw materials and then pay wages to various people to transform those raw materials into finished goods. For example, merchants would buy raw cotton or wool and then they would pay wages to spinners and weavers and dyers who would then produce a finished textile which could then be sold on the market. The system is what laid the foundation for industrialization in the next century, and this system had the effect of increasing the number of workers, especially in rural villages, who could earn wages and sustain their family.

Now the growth of this kind of market economy led to increasing demand for manufactured goods, which meant that there was a push to get manufacturing out of people's homes and into new buildings called factories. Again, we're going to talk way more about this in the next unit, so I'll just mention it briefly here. The first iteration of factories were all about textile production, which means that they made cloth goods. These factories were powered by moving water, which is why they had to be built around rivers and streams, and Richard Arkwright's water frame was a significant invention on this count. It was a wheel that was turned by moving water which could then power machines that created fabric and clothing. Workers became increasingly specialized in their jobs within the factory walls, and no longer would any one person create a sellable good from start to finish. But like I said, the cottage industry set the stage for this. In the cottage industry, merchants would bring their goods from one set of workers to the next: this house would weave the fabric, that house would dye the fabric, and on and on. And this division of labor only intensified in the factory, and all that put together led to an explosion of demand for manufactured textiles.

Now the growth of the market economy led to new financial practices and institutions as well. For example, we see the rise of the insurance industry during this time. For a monthly premium, insurance companies would recoup an entrepreneur's losses if something catastrophic happened like a fire destroying a factory. And with that kind of security, entrepreneurs, especially in England, gained confidence to invest metric buttloads of money into the factories and the growing inventories of goods for sale. Also, we saw the rise of specialty banks in venture capital. Prior to 1750, if an entrepreneur wanted to build a factory, for example, they would have to borrow money from family or have a fortune of their own. But with this explosion of commerce due to the rise of the factory system, specialty banks arose which kept only some of the money people deposited and loaned the rest out as venture capital to be paid back with interest. Venture capital, in case you don't know, is just what it sounds like: if you have a venture you'd like to attempt (like starting a business or building a factory), then this bank can loan you the capital (which is to say the boom boom) to get it done.

Okay, so that's how economic changes were playing out at the ground level, so now let's look at it from the top and see how states are experiencing economic change. Europeans are going to increasingly control the worldwide economy during this period, and as we've already talked about, that control of the worldwide economy is going to contribute significantly to events like the Agricultural Revolution and the Consumer Revolution (which we'll talk about in the next unit). But the question is: how did they come to dominate the world economy? Well, states still had their roots sunk in mercantilist policies. Remember, mercantilism was a state-driven economic system. The main goal was to increase the country's store of gold and silver by maintaining a favorable balance of trade, which means more exports than imports. You can see these kind of policies played out, for example, in France with Louis XIV's finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert. Also remember that one of the key driving factors of mercantilist policies was the establishment of colonies. And why is that? Because not only were colonies valuable sources of raw materials for their parent country, but the people who lived there could also buy the manufactured goods produced by those raw materials. And about halfway through this period, mercantilism is going to start giving way to capitalism. But for now, mercantilist policies are going to fit right in with the political trend of absolutism.

But Europe began dominating the world economy in large part because of increased demand for New World products like sugar and rice and cotton. This increase in demand meant that colonial plantation owners needed more laborers to harvest their crops. As indigenous laborers quickly died off because of European diseases or ran away, European planters increasingly turned to African enslaved laborers to work their land. This had the effect of increasing the food supply in most of Europe. As I mentioned before, these Africans were captured from their homes, forced onto slave ships, and then made to endure the brutal Middle Passage, often with only enough room for their prostrate bodies. These enslaved Africans endured weeks and sometimes months of disease and brutality only to arrive to similarly harsh conditions in the plantation fields.

And the slave trade was part of a larger system of trade known as the triangular trade. And three guesses as to what shape these trade routes resembled. Triangle? On the nose. Me from that camera. And here's how the cycle of trade went: merchants started on the west coast of Africa to buy enslaved laborers, and then they carried them across the Middle Passage to trade them in the Caribbean for sugar and molasses, and then sailed up to the Atlantic colonies in North America to trade them for rum, and then run it all over again.

Now because enslaved labor kept prices low, this global trade significantly contributed to a growing consumer culture in Europe. In other words, because these prices were low, more people were buying more things. For example, they bought sugar (which was once considered a luxury), they bought textiles made of cotton and silk, and the tobacco trade became a massive industry because what's an evening with friends without those magnificent lung darts?
