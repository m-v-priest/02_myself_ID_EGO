Okay, now with all this nationalism 民族主义 and unification 统一 and imperialism 帝国主义 dominating this period, you bet your sweet bippy that the art of this time is going to reflect and respond to it. So let's get romantic and talk about how Romanticism 浪漫主义 responded to the developments of the age. If you're ready to get them brain cows milked, let's get to it. +

Now we talked about the emergence 出现；兴起 of Romanticism way back in unit five, but in this period it's going to come into its full flower. Remember that we talked about how romantic artists rejected the cold rationality 理性 of Enlightenment thinking, while simultaneously 同时地 rejecting the calculated precision 精确性 of neoclassical 新古典主义的 forms of art. Instead, Romanticism prized 珍视 the raw emotion 原始情感 and subjectivity 主观性 as a higher subject of artistic expression 艺术表达. +

And in breaking with these older forms of art, romantic artists emphasized six themes as central to their art form. The first emphasis was emotion. That way you could see a fresh exuberance 热情洋溢；兴高采烈 in their works that defied 违抗；挑战 the cold, hard, predictable lines enjoyed by neoclassical art. For example, here's Eugène Delacroix's "Christ on the Sea of Galilee." You can see that Delacroix is trading the almost photorealistic precision 超写实精度 of neoclassicism and tries to convey 传达；表达 the emotion of the scene instead. +

The second romantic emphasis was on nature. One of the most famous landscape painters of this time was Caspar David Friedrich, and here you can see his "Seashore By Moonlight." And you can almost feel the weight of those clouds on your shoulders. The third romantic emphasis was on individuality 个性；个人特征. And again, let's consider Friedrich's painting "Wanderer Above a Sea of Fog." The lone wanderer looks upon the vast foggy landscape and seems to us to be equal to its demands. +

The fourth emphasis of romantic art was intuition 直觉. This was the idea that a human being can understand the world immediately without first reasoning it out. You can see this in lots of artists, but I'll focus on the poet William Wordsworth. His poetry is an ode 颂歌；赞美诗 to the glory hidden in everyday objects -- like a meadow or a path or a wildflower or a cliff. Reading his poetry, you get the sense that the intuitive understanding of the world is far grander than the analytical 分析的 understanding of the world. +

The fifth emphasis of romantic art was the supernatural 超自然的事物. The poet William Blake devoted nearly all of his poetic work to trying to plumb 探索；探究 the depths of Heaven and Hell. And he did not do it in the image of the analytical thinkers like John Calvin or the Puritans, but rather with an emphasis on the feeling of faith. And the sixth emphasis of romantic art was national history 民族历史. And not all romantic artists portrayed 描绘；表现 these themes, but there were some deeply inspired by a nationalist sentiment 民族主义情绪 and sought to portray their national histories in terms of emotion and intuition. +

For example, Francisco Goya's "The Third of May" depicts 描绘 Spanish rebels being executed 处决 by French forces in their conflict with Napoleon. This is a good example not only of a highly charged emotional scene but also romantic artists using their craft 技艺 for the sake of glorifying 赞美；颂扬 their national history. Or you had the Russian composer Pyotr Tchaikovsky who wrote symphonies 交响曲 and ballets 芭蕾舞剧 with interweaving harmonies 交织的和声 and great variations of pitch 音高 and volume 音量, which had a way of increasing the emotional experience of his audience. One of his more famous pieces is the "1812 Overture," which was written to glorify the Russians who had successfully held off 抵御；阻挡 Napoleon from his invasion in Russia. +

However, by the second half of the 19th century, a new art form known as realism 现实主义 came to dominate the landscape. Though there is much overlap 重叠；重合 between it and Romanticism, realist artists sought to portray the world as it was, and more specifically the world of everyday people as it was. And as the "realist" moniker 绰号；名称 suggests, they wanted to portray those scenes as realistically as possible, which was a kind of rejection of romanticism's emphasis on portraying the world through the lens of emotion. +

This movement was begun and led by the French painter Gustave Courbet. Here's his painting titled "The Stone Breakers." And you know, it's... it's a couple of guys breaking stones. So ordinary. There was also the French painter Jean-François Millet, whose painting "The Gleaners" portrays French peasants at their work, but simultaneously 同时地 -- by choosing them as the object of his work -- dignified 使有尊严；使变得崇高 their work in a way that wider society did not. +

And writers also got in on the realism party, and you should know a couple. The French writer Honoré de Balzac essentially paved the way for 为……铺平道路 the modern novel. His characters -- even his minor characters -- were both common and complex. And his work influenced the English novelist Charles Dickens, who took as the subject of many of his stories and novels the peasantry 农民阶级 and the working class. Taken as a whole, Dickens's world can be seen as a critique 批评；批判 of the Industrial Revolution's environmental and social degradation 退化；恶化. +

Now Romanticism and realism gave way to 让位于 the modern art movement around the turn of the century. As the technology of photography was gaining widespread use, painters no longer felt the need to produce their subjects in realistic fashion, but instead shifted more to abstract 抽象的, subjective 主观的 interpretations of their subjects. You can see that pendulum 钟摆 is always swinging back and forth. +

Around the late 19th century, impressionism 印象派 began to emerge. This style majored on 以……为主；专攻 light and color as the major subjects of its work. Claude Monet's "Haystacks" is a marvelous 非凡的；令人惊叹的 example. You can see that the realism has disappeared, and instead of having a clear sight of the landscape, you have a more emotional response to it -- or one might say an impression of it. And then came a reaction to impressionism, namely post-impressionism 后印象派. There was some overlap between the two stylistically, but post-impressionist artists moved toward a more symbolic 象征的 use of color and light. +

The father of this movement was Paul Cézanne, and you could see these emphases in his painting called "Portrait of Ambroise Vollard." Under the same heading, Vincent van Gogh's "Starry Night" is probably one you've seen. This is in no way an accurate representation of the scene, but you can feel the movement and the awe 敬畏；惊叹 it provokes 引起；激起 despite the colors and lines being entirely unrealistic. +

But then around the turn of the 20th century, a new form of art arose called cubism 立体主义. This movement -- the subject of the paintings became almost nonsensical 无意义的；荒谬的. It was a style that depicted 描绘 three-dimensional objects 三维物体 in two dimensions 二维空间. Pablo Picasso was the most famous of these artists, and here you can see his painting "Woman with a Mustard Pot." And you can clearly see that we are getting farther and farther away from the photorealistic paintings of the realists. +

== 中文释义

好的，在这个时期，民族主义、统一和帝国主义占据主导地位，你可以肯定，这个时期的艺术将会反映并回应这些现象。所以，让我们带着浪漫情怀，谈谈浪漫主义如何回应这个时代的发展。如果你准备好充实自己的知识，那我们开始吧。  +

我们在第五单元就已经谈到了浪漫主义的出现，但在这个时期，它将全面繁荣。记住，我们说过浪漫主义艺术家拒绝启蒙思想的冷酷理性，同时也拒绝新古典主义艺术形式的精于算计的精确性。相反，浪漫主义珍视原始情感和主观性，并将其作为艺术表达的更高主题。  +

在打破这些古老的艺术形式时，浪漫主义艺术家强调了六个主题，并将其作为他们艺术形式的核心。第一个强调的是情感。从他们的作品中，你可以看到一种全新的活力，这与新古典主义艺术所喜爱的冷酷、坚硬且可预测的线条截然不同。例如，欧仁·德拉克洛瓦（Eugène Delacroix）的《加利利海上的基督》（"Christ on the Sea of Galilee"）。你可以看到，德拉克洛瓦摒弃了新古典主义近乎逼真写实的精确性，转而试图传达场景中的情感。  +

浪漫主义强调的第二个主题是自然。这个时期最著名的风景画家之一是卡斯帕·大卫·弗里德里希（Caspar David Friedrich），在这里你可以看到他的《月光下的海岸》（"Seashore By Moonlight"）。你几乎能感受到那些云朵压在你肩上的重量。浪漫主义强调的第三个主题是个性。再以弗里德里希的画作《雾海上的漫步者》（"Wanderer Above a Sea of Fog"）为例。那个孤独的漫步者凝视着广阔的雾景，在我们看来，他与这景的要求是平等的。  +

浪漫主义艺术强调的第四个主题是直觉。其理念是，人类无需先进行推理就能立即理解世界。许多艺术家的作品中都能体现这一点，但我将重点介绍诗人威廉·华兹华斯（William Wordsworth）。他的诗歌是对隐藏在日常事物中的荣耀的颂歌——比如一片草地、一条小路、一朵野花或一座悬崖。读他的诗歌，你会感觉到，对世界的直觉理解远比分析性理解更为宏大。  +

浪漫主义艺术强调的第五个主题是超自然。诗人威廉·布莱克（William Blake）几乎将他所有的诗歌作品都用于探索天堂和地狱的深处。他不是以像约翰·加尔文（John Calvin）或清教徒那样的分析思想家的形象来做这件事，而是强调信仰的感觉。浪漫主义艺术强调的第六个主题是民族历史。并非所有浪漫主义艺术家都描绘这些主题，但有些艺术家深受民族主义情感的启发，试图从情感和直觉的角度描绘他们的民族历史。  +

例如，弗朗西斯科·戈雅（Francisco Goya）的《五月三日》（"The Third of May"）描绘了西班牙叛军在与拿破仑的冲突中被法国军队处决的场景。这不仅是一个充满强烈情感的场景的好例子，也是浪漫主义艺术家利用他们的技艺来颂扬他们的民族历史的例子。或者看看俄罗斯作曲家彼得·柴可夫斯基（Pyotr Tchaikovsky），他创作的交响乐和芭蕾舞剧交织着和声，音高和音量变化丰富，这能提升观众的情感体验。他的一部比较著名的作品是《1812序曲》（"1812 Overture"），这部作品是为了颂扬成功抵御拿破仑入侵俄罗斯的俄罗斯人而创作的。  +

然而，到了19世纪后半叶，一种被称为现实主义（realism）的新艺术形式开始占据主导地位。尽管它与浪漫主义有很多重叠之处，但现实主义艺术家试图描绘世界的真实面貌，更具体地说，是描绘普通人的世界的真实面貌。正如“现实主义”这个绰号所暗示的，他们想要尽可能真实地描绘这些场景，这是对浪漫主义强调通过情感视角描绘世界的一种摒弃。  +

这场运动是由法国画家古斯塔夫·库尔贝（Gustave Courbet）发起并引领的。这是他的画作《碎石工》（"The Stone Breakers"）。你知道，画中是几个在碎石的人。非常平凡。还有法国画家让-弗朗索瓦·米勒（Jean-François Millet），他的画作《拾穗者》（"The Gleaners"）描绘了法国农民劳作的场景，但同时，通过选择他们作为作品的对象，他以一种更广泛的社会所没有的方式赋予了他们的工作以尊严。  +

作家们也参与到现实主义的潮流中，你应该了解几位作家。法国作家奥诺雷·德·巴尔扎克（Honoré de Balzac）从根本上为现代小说铺平了道路。他作品中的人物——甚至是次要人物——既平凡又复杂。他的作品影响了英国小说家查尔斯·狄更斯（Charles Dickens），狄更斯以农民和工人阶级作为他许多故事和小说的主题。从整体上看，狄更斯的作品可以被视为对工业革命导致的环境和社会退化的批判。  +

在世纪之交，浪漫主义和现实主义让位于现代艺术运动。随着摄影技术的广泛应用，画家们不再觉得有必要以写实的方式创作他们的主题，而是更多地转向对主题的抽象、主观的诠释。你可以看到，这种趋势总是来回摆动。  +

在19世纪后期，印象派（impressionism）开始出现。这种风格以光和色彩作为其作品的主要主题。克劳德·莫奈（Claude Monet）的《干草堆》（"Haystacks"）就是一个极好的例子。你可以看到，现实主义消失了，人们对风景不再有清晰的视觉认知，而是对它有了更感性的反应——或者可以说，是对它的一种印象。然后出现了对印象派的一种回应，即后印象派（post-impressionism）。在风格上，这两者有一些重叠，但后印象派艺术家更倾向于对色彩和光线进行更具象征性的运用。  +

这场运动的先驱是保罗·塞尚（Paul Cézanne），你可以在他的画作《安布罗斯·沃拉尔的肖像》（"Portrait of Ambroise Vollard"）中看到这些特点。在同一类别下，文森特·梵高（Vincent van Gogh）的《星夜》（"Starry Night"）可能是你见过的作品。这幅画绝不是对场景的精确描绘，但尽管色彩和线条完全不现实，你仍能感受到其中的动感和它所引发的敬畏之情。  +

And you can clearly see that we are getting farther and farther away from the photorealistic paintings of the realists.
