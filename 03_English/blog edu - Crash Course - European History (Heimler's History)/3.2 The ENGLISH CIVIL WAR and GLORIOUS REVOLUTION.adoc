Welcome to a new unit in a new time period in AP Euro 美国大学预修课程欧洲历史, namely 1648 to 1815. Now many of the continental European states 欧洲大陆国家 during this period were moving toward a new iteration 迭代；版本 of monarchy 君主制, which is to say absolutism 专制主义, in which the monarch 君主 held, you know, absolute power 绝对权力. But not so in England, my friends. In England, although there was a press 趋势；倾向 toward absolutism, ultimately 最终 a constitutional government 立宪政府 won out 胜出, and it would take the English Civil War 英国内战 to settle that dispute 争端. And hey, if you want follow-along notes 配套笔记 for this and all my AP Euro videos, then the link is in the description. So if you're ready to get that brain cow's milk shared power style, then let's get to it. +

So as I mentioned, France, Prussia 普鲁士, Austria 奥地利, and Russia were all moving towards absolutism, but England was a firmly 坚定地 constitutional government 立宪政府. That means that the power of their government was limited by rule of law 法治. So with that limitation firmly established 牢固确立, no English monarch could rule absolutely 绝对统治 because that monarch was required to share power with the English Parliament 英国议会, which was the legislative body 立法机构 that represented the interests of the English people. Now that sounds like a pretty good thing, right? Well it was, but there were three points of tension 紧张点 that were brewing 酝酿. +

First was the doctrine of the divine right of kings 君权神授学说. The idea here was that just as God had granted 授予 spiritual authority 精神权力 to the church, he simultaneously 同时地 granted political authority 政治权力 to the king. And think about that for a second. Remember all that you've learned in the previous period about the authority of the church. That authority, at least by the church's own reckoning 按照教会自己的理解, was absolute 绝对的, and if anyone challenged it, it did not go well for them. And the reason is that if God granted authority to the church, then to challenge the church was to challenge God himself. So by the same reasoning 同理, if God granted political authority to the king, to challenge that authority would be a direct affront to 直接冒犯 God. And since God is never wrong, then by implication 由此推断 the king could never be wrong. Even if a king decides that he has God's own wisdom and authority, then that could get, uh, interesting. And that means that I need to introduce you to Charles the First 查理一世, who succeeded 继承 James the First 詹姆斯一世 on the throne of England 英格兰王位. +

Charles was a big believer in the divine right of kings, which he interpreted 解释 to mean that the king does whatever he wants. For example, because the king was God's vice-regent 代理人, he believed that he could seize 夺取 any land he wanted because, you know, Jesus. But that turned out to be a problem for the Parliament, especially those in the lower house 下议院, the House of Commons 下议院, who were fond of 喜欢 reminding the king that by England's constitutional standards 宪法标准, land could only be seized through the due process of law 正当法律程序. To which Charles responded, "But I want it, and you know, Jesus." And so believing that he had God's go-ahead 许可 to do whatever he wanted, Charles continued doing such things and caused great consternation 惊愕；忧虑 between him and the Parliament. +

Okay, now the second cause of the English Civil War was economic 经济原因, specifically 具体来说 when it came to the debt accrued 累积的债务 from England's participation in the Thirty Years' War 三十年战争. It'll be enough for you to know that during this war, Charles the First and his father James spent a ton of money 大量花钱 that wasn't authorized by Parliament 未经议会批准. Again, that caused tension between the crown 王室 and the people's representatives 人民代表. And all throughout the war, Parliament was trying to rein in 控制；约束 the king's extravagant spending 奢侈开支. Now in order to fix this problem, Charles decided to dissolve the Parliament 解散议会 by refusing to call them into session 召开会议 from 1629 to 1640. This period became known as Charles's personal rule 个人统治 because he did whatever he wanted without harassment 干扰 from those pesky parliamentarians 讨厌的议员 who were always going on about 喋喋不休 their rights. But as it turned out 结果是, by 1640 Charles's little divine right piggy bank 存钱罐 was empty, and he needed money to address a rebellion in Scotland 解决苏格兰叛乱. And so he called Parliament back into session. This was known as the Short Parliament 短期议会 because they weren't really cooperating with the king, so he went ahead and dismissed them again 再次解散. Then he called for elections of yet another Parliament, which became known as the Long Parliament 长期议会, so-called 之所以这么称呼 because when the diaper baby Charles the First wasn't getting what he wanted out of them, he dismissed them, and they were like, "Oh heck no." And we'll return to that tension in just a moment. +

But the third cause of the English Civil War was religious 宗教原因. Now remember that Henry VIII 亨利八世 had established the Protestant Church of England 英格兰新教教会, or the Anglican Church 英国圣公会, in defiance of 违抗 the Catholic Church 天主教会. But the truth is Henry didn't do that because he was anti-Catholic 反天主教, but rather because the pope 教皇 refused to grant him a divorce 批准他离婚. So it's not as if he was a reformer 改革者 who wanted to get as far away from Catholicism 天主教 as possible. The point is the Anglican Church was still pretty Catholic in its form and liturgy 仪式. That's when a group of English clergy 神职人员 who became known as the Puritans 清教徒 rose up 崛起 and started agitating for 鼓动 the removal of all that Catholicness from the Anglican Church, which is to say they wanted to purify the Church of England 净化英国国教会. But like the Parliament, they also ran into Charles's problem. His dad James the First wasn't interested in acting on Puritan demands 满足清教徒的要求, and then Charles did the unthinkable 不可思议的事: dude （俚语，家伙） married a Catholic. +

So the point is this: Charles the First wants to act like an absolute monarch 专制君主, but Parliament is always trying to rein him in 约束他. If you put all these causes in a pot 把这些原因放在一起, well baby, you've got a stew going 事情变得复杂, and that stew tastes like the English Civil War. Now on a broad scale 从广义上讲, the English Civil War was a conflict 冲突 between the king, Parliament, and other elites 精英 over their respective roles 各自的角色 in the political structure 政治结构. In other words 换句话说, the war was fought to decide this question: will England be ruled by an absolute monarch or exist as a constitutional monarchy 君主立宪制? To settle this question, each side prepared for battle 做好战斗准备. Charles fled to north England where he raised an army composed of 由……组成 the nobility 贵族 and rural gentry 乡绅, while Parliament created the New Model Army 新模范军. So for three years these two forces clashed 冲突, and finally the New Model Army was victorious 胜利的. But as we already established earlier, Charles was a diaper baby （俚语，任性的人） and refused to admit defeat 认输. And so the decisive move 决定性举措 came when a Puritan parliamentarian 清教徒议员 named Oliver Cromwell 奥利弗·克伦威尔 took the leadership of the New Model Army and finally crushed the king's forces 击溃国王的军队. And in doing so, Cromwell captured the king as well 也俘虏了国王. +

Afterward, Cromwell removed all members of Parliament who opposed him, and the representatives left were known as the Rump Parliament 残缺议会. And so with Parliament composed only of Cromwell supporters 由克伦威尔的支持者组成, they tried the king for treason 以叛国罪审判国王, found him guilty 判定有罪, and cut his dang （俚语，该死的） head off 斩首. So as a result, England became a true republic 共和国 called the Protectorate 护国公政体 under the leadership of Oliver Cromwell, who was named Lord Protector 护国公. And on paper 从理论上讲, the Protectorate entrusted 赋予 the legislative authority 立法权 to the remaining members of Parliament, while executive authority 行政权 was entrusted to a council 委员会. Let me further emphasize "on paper," because the truth is that after the war, England was ruled by the army with Cromwell at its head 克伦威尔领导军队统治. And that way, England was not the constitutional republic 立宪共和国 that everyone fought for, but rather a military dictatorship 军事独裁统治. And so Cromwell tried to work with Parliament to govern England, but they weren't doing what he wanted, so he dismissed them 解散议会. I feel like I've heard this story before. So for nearly a decade 近十年, Cromwell ruled England by force 武力统治 -- the very thing he fought to abolish 废除. And upon his death 他死后, the Protectorate fell apart 瓦解, and the English people were ready for a return to stability 恢复稳定, which is to say they wanted a king again. +

This became known as the Restoration period 复辟时期 in 1660, and Parliament gave the throne to Charles II 查理二世. This guy schemed with 与……密谋 France and didn't work well with Parliament. And then came James the Second 詹姆斯二世, who was worse because he kept appointing Catholics to important positions 任命天主教徒担任重要职位. Now Parliament by this point was fed up with 厌倦 the stupid monarchy 君主制, and after resisting James II over and over and over again 一次又一次抵制詹姆斯二世, offered the throne to James's daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange 奥兰治的威廉. And when James heard this plan, he took it like a man 像个男人一样接受现实 and fled 逃跑. So the throne, having been so unceremoniously abdicated 毫不客气地退位, passed to William and Mary in 1689. This transfer of power 权力转移 was known as the Glorious Revolution 光荣革命 because the monarchs were changed without bloodshed 不流血. But that's not quite true, because there were quite a few rebellions 叛乱 and quite a bit of bloodshed 流血事件. Regardless 无论如何, with the ascension 登基 of William and Mary to the throne, the idea of the divine right of kings in England was essentially put to death 终结. +

And then the last effect you need to know of this war was the composition of the English Bill of Rights 权利法案. The condition of William and Mary accepting the throne was to abide by 遵守 the English Bill of Rights, which limited the power of the monarchy 君主权力 and protected the power of Parliament 议会权力. Within the Bill of Rights, several problems were rectified 纠正. For example, it said that only Parliament had the power to raise taxes 征税权, and it also said that when Parliament passed a law, it could not be annulled by the king 国王不能废除. +

Okay, next you should go right here and keep reviewing the rest of Unit 3. And if you want follow-along notes for all the videos of Unit 3, click right here. Thanks for coming along, I'll catch you on the flip-flop. Heimler out. +

== 中文释义

欢迎来到美国大学预修课程欧洲历史的一个新单元，也就是1648年至1815年这一时期。在这一时期，许多欧洲大陆国家正朝着君主制的一种新形式发展，也就是专制主义，在这种制度下，君主拥有绝对权力。但在英国可不是这样，朋友们。在英国，尽管有走向专制主义的趋势，但最终立宪政府取得了胜利，而解决这一争端还得通过英国内战。嘿，如果你想要这个单元以及我所有美国大学预修课程欧洲历史视频的配套笔记，链接就在描述中。所以，如果你准备好以分享权力的方式充实大脑，那我们开始吧。  +

正如我提到的，法国、普鲁士、奥地利和俄罗斯都在走向专制主义，但英国建立了稳固的立宪政府。这意味着英国政府的权力受到法治的限制。由于这种限制的牢固确立，没有英国君主能够实行绝对统治，因为君主需要与代表英国人民利益的英国议会分享权力。这听起来是件好事，对吧？确实如此，但有三个紧张点正在酝酿之中。  +

第一个紧张点是君权神授的教义。其理念是，正如上帝赋予教会精神权威一样，他同时也赋予国王政治权威。稍微思考一下这个问题。记住你在上一个时期学到的关于教会权威的所有知识。那种权威，至少按照教会自己的说法，是绝对的，任何挑战它的人都没有好下场。原因是如果上帝赋予教会权威，那么挑战教会就是挑战上帝本人。所以按照同样的逻辑，如果上帝赋予国王政治权威，挑战那种权威就是直接冒犯上帝。既然上帝永远不会错，那么这就意味着国王也永远不会错。即使国王认为自己拥有上帝的智慧和权威，这也会变得很有意思。这意味着我需要向你介绍查理一世（Charles the First），他继承了詹姆斯一世（James the First）的英国王位。  +

查理一世是君权神授的坚定信仰者，他把这一教义理解为国王可以为所欲为。例如，因为国王是上帝的代理人，他认为自己可以夺取任何他想要的土地，毕竟，这是上帝的旨意（这里暗指他认为自己的行为是上帝许可的）。但这对议会来说是个问题，尤其是下议院（House of Commons）的议员们，他们喜欢提醒国王，根据英国的宪法标准，土地只能通过正当法律程序被夺取。对此，查理一世回应道：“但我想要（这些土地），而且你知道的，这是上帝的意思（暗指他认为自己的行为是上帝许可的）。” 所以，查理一世认为自己得到了上帝的许可可以为所欲为，他继续这样做，这在他和议会之间引起了极大的不满。  +

好的，英国内战的第二个原因是经济方面的，具体来说是英国参与三十年战争（Thirty Years' War）所累积的债务问题。你只需要知道，在这场战争期间，查理一世和他的父亲詹姆斯一世花了大量未经议会授权的钱。这再次在王室和人民代表之间引发了紧张关系。在整个战争期间，议会一直试图控制国王的奢侈开支。为了解决这个问题，查理一世决定在1629年至1640年期间拒绝召集议会，从而解散了议会。这一时期被称为查理一世的个人统治时期，因为他可以为所欲为，不受那些总是谈论自己权利的讨厌的议员们的干扰。但事实证明，到1640年，查理一世那基于君权神授的“存钱罐”（这里指他的权力和财富来源）空了，他需要钱来镇压苏格兰的叛乱。所以他再次召集议会。这个议会被称为短期议会（Short Parliament），因为他们并不真正与国王合作，所以查理一世又把他们解散了。然后他又召集了另一个议会的选举，这个议会被称为长期议会（Long Parliament），之所以这么叫，是因为当查理一世这个“巨婴”（这里形容他任性的行为）没有从议会那里得到他想要的东西时，他就解散了他们，而议会则表示：“哦，绝不答应。” 我们马上会再回到这种紧张关系上来。  +

英国内战的第三个原因是宗教方面的。记住，亨利八世（Henry VIII）建立了英国新教教会，也就是英国国教会（Anglican Church），以此来对抗天主教会（Catholic Church）。但事实上，亨利八世这样做并不是因为他反对天主教，而是因为教皇拒绝批准他离婚。所以他并不是一个想要尽可能远离天主教的改革者。关键是英国国教会在形式和礼仪方面仍然非常天主教化。就在这时，一群被称为清教徒（Puritans）的英国神职人员崛起，开始鼓动从英国国教会中去除所有天主教的东西，也就是说他们想要净化英国国教会。但和议会一样，他们也遇到了查理一世的问题。查理一世的父亲詹姆斯一世对满足清教徒的要求不感兴趣，然后查理一世做了一件不可思议的事：这家伙娶了一个天主教徒。  +

所以重点是：查理一世想要成为一个专制君主，但议会一直试图约束他。如果你把所有这些原因放在一起，宝贝，就酿成了一场“ stew ”（这里指混乱的局面），而这场“ stew ”的味道就是英国内战。从广义上讲，英国内战是国王、议会和其他精英之间关于他们在政治结构中各自角色的冲突。换句话说，这场战争是为了解决这个问题：英国将由专制君主统治，还是成为一个君主立宪制国家？为了解决这个问题，双方都做好了战斗准备。查理一世逃到了英格兰北部，在那里他组建了一支由贵族和乡村绅士组成的军队，而议会则组建了新模范军（New Model Army）。所以这两股势力交锋了三年，最终新模范军取得了胜利。但正如我们之前所确定的，查理一世是个“巨婴”，他拒绝承认失败。所以决定性的举动是，一个名叫奥利弗·克伦威尔（Oliver Cromwell）的清教徒议员接管了新模范军的领导权，并最终击败了国王的军队。这样一来，克伦威尔还俘虏了国王。  +

此后，克伦威尔驱逐了所有反对他的议会议员，剩下的代表们被称为残余议会（Rump Parliament）。所以，在议会仅由克伦威尔的支持者组成的情况下，他们以叛国罪审判了国王，判定他有罪，并砍掉了他的脑袋。结果，英国成为了一个真正的共和国，在奥利弗·克伦威尔的领导下被称为护国公政体（Protectorate），克伦威尔被称为护国公（Lord Protector）。从理论上讲，护国公政体将立法权委托给了议会的剩余成员，而行政权则委托给了一个委员会。我要进一步强调“从理论上讲”，因为事实上，战争结束后，英国是由以克伦威尔为首的军队统治的。这样一来，英国并不是大家为之战斗的立宪共和国，而是一个军事独裁政权。所以克伦威尔试图与议会合作来治理英国，但议会并没有按照他的意愿行事，所以他解散了议会。我感觉我以前听过这个故事。所以在近十年的时间里，克伦威尔通过武力统治英国——而这正是他曾经为之战斗想要废除的东西。克伦威尔死后，护国公政体瓦解，英国人民渴望恢复稳定，也就是说他们又想要一个国王了。  +

这一时期在1660年被称为复辟时期（Restoration period），议会将王位交给了查理二世（Charles II）。这家伙与法国密谋，并且与议会合作得很不好。然后詹姆斯二世（James the Second）继位，他更糟糕，因为他一直任命天主教徒担任重要职位。此时的议会受够了愚蠢的君主制，在一次又一次地抵制詹姆斯二世之后，议会将王位提供给了詹姆斯二世的女儿玛丽（Mary）和她的丈夫奥兰治的威廉（William of Orange）。当詹姆斯二世听到这个计划时，他像个“男人”（这里是反讽，暗指他的行为并不像真正的男人那样有担当）一样逃跑了。所以，王位在被毫不客气地放弃后，于1689年传给了威廉和玛丽。这种权力转移被称为光荣革命（Glorious Revolution），因为君主的更替没有流血冲突。但这并不完全正确，因为发生了不少叛乱，也流了不少血。无论如何，随着威廉和玛丽登上王位，英国的君权神授理念基本上被废除了。  +

然后你需要了解这场战争的最后一个影响是《权利法案》（English Bill of Rights）的制定。威廉和玛丽接受王位的条件是遵守《权利法案》，该法案限制了君主的权力并保护了议会的权力。在《权利法案》中，几个问题得到了解决。例如，它规定只有议会有权征税，并且它还规定议会通过的法律不能被国王废除。  +

好的，接下来你应该点击这里继续复习第三单元的其余内容。如果你想要第三单元所有视频的配套笔记，点击这里。感谢你的陪伴，我们下次再见。海姆勒下线了。  +

Welcome to a new unit in a new time period in AP Euro, namely 1648 to 1815. Now many of the continental European states during this period were moving toward a new iteration of monarchy, which is to say absolutism, in which the monarch held, you know, absolute power. But not so in England, my friends. In England, although there was a press toward absolutism, ultimately a constitutional government won out, and it would take the English Civil War to settle that dispute. And hey, if you want follow-along notes for this and all my AP Euro videos, then the link is in the description. So if you're ready to get that brain cow's milk shared power style, then let's get to it.

So as I mentioned, France, Prussia, Austria, and Russia were all moving towards absolutism, but England was a firmly constitutional government. That means that the power of their government was limited by rule of law. So with that limitation firmly established, no English monarch could rule absolutely because that monarch was required to share power with the English Parliament, which was the legislative body that represented the interests of the English people. Now that sounds like a pretty good thing, right? Well it was, but there were three points of tension that were brewing.

First was the doctrine of the divine right of kings. The idea here was that just as God had granted spiritual authority to the church, he simultaneously granted political authority to the king. And think about that for a second. Remember all that you've learned in the previous period about the authority of the church. That authority, at least by the church's own reckoning, was absolute, and if anyone challenged it, it did not go well for them. And the reason is that if God granted authority to the church, then to challenge the church was to challenge God himself. So by the same reasoning, if God granted political authority to the king, to challenge that authority would be a direct affront to God. And since God is never wrong, then by implication the king could never be wrong. Even if a king decides that he has God's own wisdom and authority, then that could get, uh, interesting. And that means that I need to introduce you to Charles the First, who succeeded James the First on the throne of England.

Charles was a big believer in the divine right of kings, which he interpreted to mean that the king does whatever he wants. For example, because the king was God's vice-regent, he believed that he could seize any land he wanted because, you know, Jesus. But that turned out to be a problem for the Parliament, especially those in the lower house, the House of Commons, who were fond of reminding the king that by England's constitutional standards, land could only be seized through the due process of law. To which Charles responded, "But I want it, and you know, Jesus." And so believing that he had God's go-ahead to do whatever he wanted, Charles continued doing such things and caused great consternation between him and the Parliament.

Okay, now the second cause of the English Civil War was economic, specifically when it came to the debt accrued from England's participation in the Thirty Years' War. It'll be enough for you to know that during this war, Charles the First and his father James spent a ton of money that wasn't authorized by Parliament. Again, that caused tension between the crown and the people's representatives. And all throughout the war, Parliament was trying to rein in the king's extravagant spending. Now in order to fix this problem, Charles decided to dissolve the Parliament by refusing to call them into session from 1629 to 1640. This period became known as Charles's personal rule because he did whatever he wanted without harassment from those pesky parliamentarians who were always going on about their rights. But as it turned out, by 1640 Charles's little divine right piggy bank was empty, and he needed money to address a rebellion in Scotland. And so he called Parliament back into session. This was known as the Short Parliament because they weren't really cooperating with the king, so he went ahead and dismissed them again. Then he called for elections of yet another Parliament, which became known as the Long Parliament, so-called because when the diaper baby Charles the First wasn't getting what he wanted out of them, he dismissed them, and they were like, "Oh heck no." And we'll return to that tension in just a moment.

But the third cause of the English Civil War was religious. Now remember that Henry VIII had established the Protestant Church of England, or the Anglican Church, in defiance of the Catholic Church. But the truth is Henry didn't do that because he was anti-Catholic, but rather because the pope refused to grant him a divorce. So it's not as if he was a reformer who wanted to get as far away from Catholicism as possible. The point is the Anglican Church was still pretty Catholic in its form and liturgy. That's when a group of English clergy who became known as the Puritans rose up and started agitating for the removal of all that Catholicness from the Anglican Church, which is to say they wanted to purify the Church of England. But like the Parliament, they also ran into Charles's problem. His dad James the First wasn't interested in acting on Puritan demands, and then Charles did the unthinkable: dude married a Catholic.

So the point is this: Charles the First wants to act like an absolute monarch, but Parliament is always trying to rein him in. If you put all these causes in a pot, well baby, you've got a stew going, and that stew tastes like the English Civil War. Now on a broad scale, the English Civil War was a conflict between the king, Parliament, and other elites over their respective roles in the political structure. In other words, the war was fought to decide this question: will England be ruled by an absolute monarch or exist as a constitutional monarchy? To settle this question, each side prepared for battle. Charles fled to north England where he raised an army composed of the nobility and rural gentry, while Parliament created the New Model Army. So for three years these two forces clashed, and finally the New Model Army was victorious. But as we already established earlier, Charles was a diaper baby and refused to admit defeat. And so the decisive move came when a Puritan parliamentarian named Oliver Cromwell took the leadership of the New Model Army and finally crushed the king's forces. And in doing so, Cromwell captured the king as well.

Afterward, Cromwell removed all members of Parliament who opposed him, and the representatives left were known as the Rump Parliament. And so with Parliament composed only of Cromwell supporters, they tried the king for treason, found him guilty, and cut his dang head off. So as a result, England became a true republic called the Protectorate under the leadership of Oliver Cromwell, who was named Lord Protector. And on paper, the Protectorate entrusted the legislative authority to the remaining members of Parliament, while executive authority was entrusted to a council. Let me further emphasize "on paper," because the truth is that after the war, England was ruled by the army with Cromwell at its head. And that way, England was not the constitutional republic that everyone fought for, but rather a military dictatorship. And so Cromwell tried to work with Parliament to govern England, but they weren't doing what he wanted, so he dismissed them. I feel like I've heard this story before. So for nearly a decade, Cromwell ruled England by force -- the very thing he fought to abolish. And upon his death, the Protectorate fell apart, and the English people were ready for a return to stability, which is to say they wanted a king again.

This became known as the Restoration period in 1660, and Parliament gave the throne to Charles II. This guy schemed with France and didn't work well with Parliament. And then came James the Second, who was worse because he kept appointing Catholics to important positions. Now Parliament by this point was fed up with the stupid monarchy, and after resisting James II over and over and over again, offered the throne to James's daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange. And when James heard this plan, he took it like a man and fled. So the throne, having been so unceremoniously abdicated, passed to William and Mary in 1689.
