Fiona: And so cheap. Right, I mean, compared to here ... +
Lesley: Yes, although the shops are expensive. +
Fiona: Mm, yes. +
Lesley: I mean, really I bought nothing at all. I just ate and ate and drank and drank. +
Fiona: I know. Wasn't that lovely? +
Lesley: Yes, and I, I go there. I like listening to the people talking, sitting outside drinking wine. +
Fiona: Yes. Could you understand what they were saying? When they were speaking quickly, I mean. +
Lesley: Well, it is difficult, of course. And then I liked that tower, too. +
Fiona: You liked that tower? I'm not sure about it, really. (No) It's very unusual, right in the centre of the city. +

菲奥娜：哦，真的太棒了。 +

莱斯利：那会很可爱，不是吗？ +
菲奥娜：是的。

First speaker: 

I'm a night person 夜猫子（熬夜的人）. I love the hours, you know? I like going to work at around six at night and then getting home at two or three in the morning. I like being out around people, you know, talking to them, listening to their problems. 

Some of my regulars  常客；老主顾 are always on the lookout  监视员；观察员；瞭望员 for ways that they can stump 把…难住；难倒 me. Like last week, one of them came in and asked for a Ramos gin 杜松子酒 fizz （液体中的）气泡;（液体中的）气泡嘶嘶声，嘶嘶声；噼啪声;起泡饮料（尤指香槟）. He didn't think I knew how to make it. Hah! But I know how to make every drink in the book, and then some 而且还远不止此. 

Although some of the nights when I go in I just don't feel like dealing with all the noise. When I get in a big crowd it can be pretty noisy. People talking, the sound system  音响系统 blaring 发出（响亮而刺耳的声音）, the pinball 弹球游戏 machine, the video games. And then at the end of the night you don't always smell so good, either. You smell like cigarettes. But I like the place and I plan on 打算；期待 sticking around 不走开；待在原地 for a while.

第一位演讲者：我是一个夜猫子。我喜欢这些时间，你知道吗？我喜欢在晚上六点左右上班，然后在凌晨两三点回家。我喜欢和人们在一起，和他们交谈，倾听他们的问题。我的一些常客总是在寻找可以难倒我的方法。和上周一样，其中一人进来要了一杯拉莫斯杜松子酒。他不认为我知道如何做到这一点。哈！但我知道如何制作书中的每一杯饮料，然后是一些。虽然有些晚上我进去的时候，我只是不想处理所有的噪音。当我进入一大群人时，可能会很吵。人们交谈，音响系统发出刺耳的声音，弹球机，视频游戏。然后在晚上结束时，你也并不总是闻起来那么好闻。你闻起来像香烟。但我喜欢这个地方，我打算在这里呆一段时间。
====

Second speaker: 

If I had to sit behind a desk all day, I'd go crazy! I'm really glad I have a job where I can keep moving, you know? My favourite part is picking out 精心挑选;（不用乐谱）慢慢地弹奏（乐曲）;（经仔细研究）找出，认识到 the music — I use new music for every ten-week session 一场；一节；一段时间. For my last class I always use the Beatles 披头士合唱（摇滚乐队）— it's a great beat  （音乐、诗歌等的）主节奏，节拍 to move to 使感动；打动, and everybody loves them. 


I like to sort of educate people about their bodies, and show them, you know, how to do the exercises and movements safely. Like, it just kills me when I see people trying to do situps 仰卧起坐 with straight legs — it' so bad for your back! And …​ let's see …​ I — I like to see people make progress — at the end of a session you can really see how people have slimmed （靠节食等）变苗条，减肥 down and sort of built up some muscle — it's very gratifying 令人高兴的；使人满意的.

[.my1]
====
.pick sbsth←→ˈout

• She was picked out from dozens of applicants for the job. 她从大批的求职者中被选中承担这项工作。 +

第二位演讲者：如果我不得不整天坐在桌子后面，我会发疯的！我真的很高兴我有一份可以继续前进的工作，你知道吗？我最喜欢的部分是挑选音乐——我每十周使用一次新音乐。在我的最后一堂课上，我总是使用披头士乐队——这是一个很棒的节拍，每个人都喜欢它们。我喜欢教育人们了解他们的身体，并向他们展示，你知道，如何安全地进行锻炼和运动。就像，当我看到人们试图用直腿做仰卧起坐时，它简直要了我的命——这对你的背部太糟糕了！和。。。我看看。。。我——我喜欢看到人们取得进步——在会议结束时，你真的可以看到人们是如何瘦下来的，并建立了一些肌肉——这是非常令人欣慰的。
====

`主` #The part# 后定向前推进 I don't like  `系` #is#, well, it's hard to keep coming up with 找到（答案）；拿出（一笔钱等） new ideas for classes. I mean, you know, there are just so many ways you can move your body, and it's hard to keep coming up with interesting routines （演出中的）一套动作，一系列笑话（等） and …​ and new exercises. And it's hard on my voice — I have to yell (v.)叫喊；大喊；吼叫 all the time so people can hear me above the music, and like after three classes in one day my voice has had 情形很糟；不能修复 it. Then again, `主` having three classes in one day `谓` has its compensations 补偿（或赔偿）物 — I can eat just about anything I want and not gain any weight!

[.my2]
我不喜欢的部分是，很难不断地为课程提出新的想法。我的意思是，你知道，有很多方法可以让你的身体运动，很难一直想出有趣的套路和新的锻炼方法。这对我的声音来说很困难——我必须一直大喊大叫，这样人们才能在音乐的噪音中听到我的声音，就像一天上了三节课一样，我的声音已经不行了。再说一次，一天上三节课也有它的补偿——我可以吃任何我想吃的东西，而且不会增加任何体重!

Third speaker: What do I like about my job? Money. M-O-N-E-Y. No, I like the creativity, and I like my studio. All my tools are like toys to me — you know, my watercolours, pen and inks, coloured pencils, drafting table — I love playing with them. and I have lots of different kinds of clients — I do magazines, book covers, album covers, newspaper articles — so there's lots of variety, which I like. You know, sometimes when I start working on a project I could be doing it for hours and have no conception of how much time has gone by — what some people call a flow experience 心流体验. I don't like the pressure, though, and there's plenty of it in this business. You're always working against a tight deadline. And I don't like the business end of it — you know, contacting 接触；接洽联络 clients for work, negotiating contracts, which get long and complicated.

[.my2]
第三个说话者:我喜欢我的工作的哪一点?钱。M-O-N-E-Y。不，我喜欢创意，我喜欢我的工作室。我所有的工具对我来说都像玩具一样——你知道，我的水彩画、钢笔和墨水、彩色铅笔、绘图桌——我喜欢玩它们。我有很多不同类型的客户——我做杂志封面、书籍封面、专辑封面、报纸文章——所以有很多种类，我喜欢这些。你知道，有时当我开始做一个项目时，我可能会做几个小时，并且不知道有多少时间过去了——有些人称之为心流体验。但我不喜欢压力，而这一行压力太多了。你总是在紧迫的期限前工作。而且我不喜欢它的业务端——你知道，为工作联系客户，谈判合同，这些都变得又长又复杂。

Fourth speaker: Well, I'll tell you. At first it was fun, because there was so much to learn, and working with figures and money was interesting. But after about two years the thrill 震颤感；兴奋感 was gone, and now it's very routine 常规的；例行公事的;乏味的；平淡的. I keep the books 记账, do the payroll 工资名单;（公司的）工资总支出, pay the taxes, pay the insurance, pay the bills. I hate paying the bills, because there's never enough money to pay them! I also don't like the pressure of having to remember when all the bills and taxes are due (a.)到期;应支付；应给予. And my job requires a lot of reading that I don't particularly enjoy. I can have to keep up [to date 迄今，到现在为止] on all the latest tax forms, and it's pretty dull. I like it when we're making money, though, because I get to see all of my efforts rewarded.

[.my2]
第四位发言者:我来告诉你们。一开始很有趣，因为有很多东西要学，和数字和钱打交道很有趣。但大约两年后，这种兴奋感消失了，现在这已经很平常了。我记账，发工资，缴税，付保险，付账单。我讨厌付账单，因为我总是没有足够的钱来付账单!我也不喜欢记住所有的账单和税款什么时候到期的压力。我的工作需要大量的阅读，我不是特别喜欢。我可能不得不跟上所有最新的纳税表格，这很无聊。我喜欢我们赚钱的时候，因为我看到我所有的努力都得到了回报。

Jane Smith: Well …​ I …​ I don't know really …​ it's not the sort of question you ask yourself directly.

简·史密斯:嗯，我真的不知道，这不是你直接问自己的问题。我知道我很擅长我的工作，至少我的老板说我勤奋、认真、高效。顺便说一下，我是个秘书。当我对着镜子看自己的时候，你知道，有时候你会在自己的卧室里私下照镜子，或者当你走在街上时看着商店橱窗里的自己，然后我看到了一个有点不同的人。是的，我的私生活和别人不一样。这可能是我的主要缺点，我应该说，我不完全，哦，我该怎么说呢?-我想我的行为是不连贯的。我的办公室总是井井有条，但是我的公寓!嗯，你得亲眼看到才会相信。

Chris Bonner: I think the question is irrelevant 无关紧要的；不相关的. You shouldn't be asking what I think of myself …​ but what I think of the state of this country. And this country is in a terrible mess. There's only one hope for it — the National Front. It's law and order that we need. I say get rid of these thugs 恶棍；暴徒；罪犯 who call themselves Socialist Workers …​ get rid of them I say. So don't ask about me. I'm the sort of ordinary 普通的；平常的 decent 正派的；公平的；合乎礼节的 person who wants to bring law and order back to this country. And if we can't do it by peaceful means then …​

克里斯·邦纳:我认为这个问题无关紧要。你不应该问我怎么看自己，而应该问我怎么看这个国家。而这个国家正处于可怕的混乱之中。只有一个希望，那就是国民阵线。我们需要的是法律和秩序。我说除掉这些自称社会主义工人的暴徒…除掉他们。所以别问我。我是那种想让这个国家恢复法律和秩序的普通正派人。如果我们不能以和平的方式解决，那么……

Arthur Fuller: Well …​ when I was young I was very shy. At times 有时候 I …​ I was very unhappy …​ especially when I was sent to boarding-school 寄宿学校 at seven. I didn't make close friends till …​ till quite late in life …​ till I was about …​ what …​ fifteen. Then I became quite good at being by myself. I had no one to rely on …​ and no one to ask for advice. That made me independent …​ and I've always solved my problems myself. My wife and I have two sons. We …​ we didn't want an only child because I felt …​ well I felt I'd missed a lot of things.

阿瑟·富勒:嗯……我小时候很害羞。有时我……我很不开心……尤其是当我七岁被送到寄宿学校的时候。直到很晚的时候，我才交到了亲密的朋友，大概是15岁吧。然后我变得很擅长独处。我没有人可以依靠，也没有人可以向我征求意见。这让我变得独立，而且我总是自己解决问题。我和妻子有两个儿子。我们不想要独生子，因为我觉得我错过了很多东西。
