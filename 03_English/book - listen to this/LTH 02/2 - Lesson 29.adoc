Lesson 29


== part 1. 部分

Linda: Oh, yes, I remember.  +
We were conducting (v.) a survey into the, the needs of _disabled people_ in the borough 自治市镇；（城市）行政区 (Yes) in which I work in London.  +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.borough
a town or part of a city that has its own local government 自治市镇；（城市）行政区

-> 英语单词borough 与 burg、burgh同源。 +
西方好多城市都以 burg 或 burgh 结尾，如汉堡（Hamburg）、爱丁堡（Edinburgh）、匹兹堡（Pittsburgh）。

burg或burgh就是“城镇”的意思，不过和city或town不同，burg或burgh指的是带碉堡的城市，也就是说，它们在成为城市之前其实就是一座要塞或一座城堡。

borough在英语中表示“自治市”。“带碉堡的城市”与“自治市”有何关联呢？原来，自治市的自治权是打仗打下来的，所以这些城市自然要修筑碉堡来保卫自己。

在欧洲封建时期，城镇的主权, 原本都是属于封建贵族即所谓“领主”（Lord）的，是他的封地的一部分。后来，随着工商业的发展，城镇越来越繁荣，市民的经济地位提高了，对封建贵族对城镇的压榨越来越不满。所以市民们想方设法争取城市自治。

刚开始时，市民们用钱, 从领主那里一项一项地赎回城市的各种权利，因为那个时候市民们通过经商积累了大量货币，而领主的收入主要是封地上的各种农产品，所以缺乏货币。在11、12世纪又赶上了十字军东征运动，大批领主要参加十字军，亟需便于携带的金银货币充当盘缠，所以就把很多权利都卖给市民了。

但钱不能买到所有权利，所以领主和市民免不了要开战，城市的自治权就是通过赎买和战争的方式获得了。因此自治市中常常修筑了各种防御工事，用来保卫城市的主权。

borough：['bʌrə] n.自治市，区 burg：[bɜːg] n.镇、城、村 burgh：['bʌrə] n.（苏格兰）自治市，城镇

And we got a request from an old man to go along 继续,进展；发展 and, and see him in connection with 与…有关（或相关） this survey.  +

Well, `主` #some# of the people that I’d seen on the survey before `系` #were# really _quite poor_ and lived (v.) in very bad housing conditions.  +
(Yes) They were also …​ tended (v.) to be elderly (a.)年纪较大的，上了年纪的 and to really have some _quite bad disabilities_ 残疾, so I was quite prepared for, for anything I thought that I might meet.  +

[.my2]
琳达：哦，是的，我记得。我们正在对我在伦敦工作的行政区（是的）残疾人的需求, 进行一项调查。我们收到一位老人的请求，希望我们能一起去见见他，以完成这项调查。嗯，我之前在调查中, 看到的一些人确实很穷，居住条件也很差。 （是的）他们也……往往年纪较大，而且确实有一些非常严重的残疾，所以我对我认为可能遇到的任何事情, 都做好了准备。

Anyway, I went along to, to this house and it was not [at all] what I’d expected.  +
It was a, a large house and really had an air of _fa, faded 褪色的,（记忆等）消褪的 gentility_ (n.)幽静古朴;文雅；彬彬有礼；高贵的身份 about it.  +
It was in _a part of the borough_ which had (Really?) once been quite fashionable.  +

Er, I knocked at the door and the old man, Mr. Sinclair, came to, to let me in and showed me into a back room, which he lived in.  +
The rest of the house, I think, must have been shut up and he was just living in one or two rooms.  +

(How extraordinary! 意想不到的；令人惊奇的；奇怪的) Anyway, we started the interview which I had to, to conduct with him and he was very, very willing (a.) to talk but he never stopped grumbling.  +
He grumbled about …​ young people, about _the rising cost of living_, about the government, about _how the area had gone down_, and so on and so forth 等等，诸如此类.  +

He didn’t seem to have a _good word_ 好话; 好消息; 佳音. to say for anybody [at all]. (S …​ )

[.my2]
不管怎样，我还是去了，去了这所房子，这根本不是我所期望的。那是一栋大房子，确实有一种法式的气息，但也有一种褪色的绅士风度。它位于该行政区的一部分，（真的吗？）曾经非常时尚。呃，我敲了敲门，老人辛克莱先生过来了，让我进去，并带我进入他住的后面的房间。我想，房子的其余部分一定是关着的, 他只住在一两个房间里。 （多么非凡！）无论如何，我们开始了我必须与他进行的采访，他非常非常愿意说话，但他从未停止抱怨。他抱怨……年轻人、生活成本上升、政府、该地区的衰落等等。他似乎根本没有对任何人说好话。 （S…​）

Janet: Got a real chip （木头、玻璃等的）缺口，缺损处 on his shoulder?

[.my2]
珍妮特：他的肩膀上真的受伤了吗？

[.my1]
.案例
====
.have a chip on one's shoulder.
表面的字面意思是: 某人”肩膀上有一块木头“。（chip是木块的意思）. 但实际上, 它是一句成语, +
Someone who has a chip on his shoulder is angry all the time. +
If you have a chip on your shoulder, you seem angry all the time because you think you have been treated unfairly or feel you are not as good as other people.

就是形容"一个人总是气哼哼的，觉得外界对不起他。"在有些场景下，也就有了"记仇"的意思。

- He has had a chip on his shoulder ever since he didn't get the promotion he was expecting. 自从他一直盼望的升职希望落空后，他心里就有了怨气了。

Linda: Well, he was.  +
He was _a really grumpy (a.)脾气坏的，爱抱怨的 old man_ and not very likeable (a.)可爱的；讨人喜欢的 with it.  +
But he was …​ rather frail (a.)瘦弱的;弱的；易损的；易碎的 and in his eighties and …​ I just accepted that perhaps, you know, he’d had a hard life in, in some way an, and hadn’t really resolved it.  +

Anyway, I left the, er, the house and went back to the office, wrote up （利用笔记等）详细写出 the interview and didn’t think any more about it.  +

[.my2]
琳达：嗯，他是。他是一个脾气暴躁的老人，不太讨人喜欢。但他……相当虚弱，已经八十多岁了……我只是接受了这一点，也许，你知道，他在某种程度上过着艰难的生活，而且还没有真正解决这个问题。不管怎样，我离开了，呃，房子，回到办公室，写下了采访，没有再想它。

And then about a week later, I got _a phone call_ from him saying that he thought (v.) he’d left out 遗漏,不包括，排斥 some important things about himself (Really?) 后定 that I should know, and would I go and see him again.  +

So I explained #that# it was a survey 后定 that we were doing #and that# it wasn’t really very usual (a.) to go back and see somebody a second time, but if he felt (v.) it was really important then, of course, I would go.  +

(Yeah) So I went along and _exactly 精确地；准确地；确切地 the same thing_ happened as had happened before.  +
He showed me into the back room and he started grumbling (v.) again and this went on for about half an hour and I began to wonder why on earth he’d asked me to go back a second time.

[.my2]
大约一周后，我接到他的电话，说他认为他遗漏了一些我应该知道的关于自己的重要事情（真的吗？），我会再去见他吗？所以我解释说，这是我们正在进行的一项调查，第二次回去见某人并不常见，但如果他觉得这真的很重要，那么我当然会去。 （是的）所以我就跟着去了，结果发生了和以前一模一样的事情。他带我到后面的房间，他又开始抱怨，这种情况持续了大约半个小时，我开始想知道他到底为什么要我第二次回去。

Janet: He didn’t tell you anything new about himself?

[.my2]
珍妮特：他没有告诉你任何关于他自己的新事吗？

Linda: Well, he …​ after about half an hour he started.  +
He said, 'I, I expect you wonder why I’ve asked you to come back,' (Quite) and I said, 'Well, as a matter of fact, yes I do.'  +

So he said, 'Well, I think I should tell you a bit about myself and perhaps explain why I, I seem to have a chip on my shoulder,' which took me aback （被…）吓了一跳；大吃一惊；震惊, back [a bit], you know.  +


[.my2]
琳达：嗯，他……大约半小时后他开始了。他说，“我，我希望你想知道, 为什么我要你回来，”（相当）我说，“嗯，事实上，是的，我想知道。”所以他说，“好吧，我想我应该告诉你一些关于我自己的事情，或许还可以解释一下为什么我，我似乎有一种不满，”  他的话让我有点吃惊，你知道。

== How to Present a Seminar Paper

3.如何提交研讨会论文

In this talk, I am going to give some advice on how to present (v.) _a seminar （大学教师带领学生作专题讨论的）研讨课;研讨会；培训会 paper_.

[.my2]
在本次演讲中，我将就如何提交研讨会论文, 提出一些建议。

[.my1]
.案例

.seminar
-> 来自德语 Seminar,研讨会，讨论会，来自拉丁语 seminarium,育种室，来自 semen,种子，-arium, 表地方。

At one time, most university teaching (n.) `谓` took the form of giving formal lectures.  +
Nowadays, many university teachers try to involve their students more actively in the learning process.  +

`主` One of the ways in which this is done `系` is by conducting seminars.  +
In a seminar, what usually happens is this.  +
One student is chosen to give his ideas on a certain topic.  +
These ideas are then discussed by the other students (the participants) in the seminar.

[.my2]
曾经，大多数大学教学, 都采取正式讲座的形式。如今，许多大学教师, 试图让学生更积极地参与学习过程。实现这一目标的方法之一, 是举办研讨会。在研讨会上，通常会发生这样的情况。选择一名学生就某个主题发表自己的想法。然后研讨会上的其他学生（参与者）, 讨论这些想法。

What I’d like to discuss (v.) with you today `系`  is the techniques of presenting (v.) a paper at a seminar.  +
As you know, there are two main stages involved in this.  +

One is _the preparation stage_ which involves researching and writing up a topic.  +
The other stage is _the presentation 提交；授予；颁发；出示 stage_ when you actually present the paper to your audience.  +
#It is# this second stage #that# I am concerned 与…有关；涉及;担心，忧虑 with now.  +

Let us therefore imagine #that# you have been asked to lead off 开始（某事） a seminar discussion and #that# you have done all the necessary preparation.  +
In other words you have done your research and you have written it up. How are you going to present it?

[.my2]
今天我想和大家讨论的, 是在研讨会上发表论文的技巧。如您所知，这涉及两个主要阶段。一是准备阶段，涉及研究和撰写主题。另一个阶段是演示阶段，当你实际向观众展示论文时。我现在关心的是第二阶段。因此，让我们想象一下，您被要求主持一场研讨会讨论，并且您已经完成了所有必要的准备。换句话说，你已经完成了你的研究, 并且已经把它写下来了。你打算如何展示它？

[.my1]
.案例
====
.lead offˌ| lead sth off
to start sth开始（某事） +
- Who would like to lead off the debate? 谁愿带头发言开始辩论？
====

There are two ways in which this can be done.

[.my2]
有两种方法, 可以做到这一点。

The first method is to circulate (v.) copies of the paper [in advance] to all the participants.   This gives them time to read it before the seminar, so that they can come (v.) already prepared with their own ideas about what you have written.  +

The second method is where there is no time for previous circulation, or there is some other reason why the paper cannot _be circulated_.  In that case, of course, the paper will have to read aloud to the group, who will probably make their own notes 笔记；记录;注释；按语；批注 on it while they are listening.

[.my2]
第一种方法是, 提前将论文副本分发给所有参与者。这让他们有时间在研讨会之前, 阅读它，这样, 他们就可以对你所写的内容, 有自己的想法。 +
第二种方法是, 以前没有时间流通，或者有其他原因导致报纸不能流通。在这种情况下，当然，论文必须大声朗读给小组听，他们可能会在听的时候自己做笔记。

In this talk, I am going to concentrate on the first method, where the paper is circulated in advance, as 因为 this is the most efficient way of conducting a seminar; but `主` most of what I am going to say `谓` also applies to the second method; and indeed may be useful to remember (v.) 时间状 [any time] you have to speak in public.

[.my2]
在这次演讲中，我将重点讨论第一种方法，即提前分发论文，因为这是举办研讨会最有效的方法；但我要说的大部分内容, 也适用于第二种方法；事实上，任何时候你必须在公共场合演讲时, 记住这一点可能会很有用。

You will probably be expected to introduce your paper even if it has been circulated beforehand.  +
There are two good reasons for this. One is that the participants 参与者；参加者 may have read the paper but forgotten some of the main points.  +
The second reason is that some of the participants may not in fact have had time to read your paper, although they may have glanced through it quickly.  They will therefore not be in a position to comment on it, unless they get some idea of what it is all about.

[.my2]
即使您的论文, 已经事先分发过，您也可能需要介绍它。这有两个很好的理由。一是参与者可能已经阅读了论文，但忘记了一些要点。第二个原因是，一些参与者实际上可能没有时间阅读你的论文，尽管他们可能很快地浏览了一遍。因此，除非他们了解事情的全部内容，否则他们无法对此发表评论。

When you are introducing (v.) your paper, what you must not do `系`  is simply read (v.) the whole paper aloud. This is because:

[.my2]
当你介绍你的论文时，你绝对不能只是大声朗读整篇论文。这是因为：

Firstly, if the paper is a fairly 相当地，颇 long one, there may not be enough time for discussion.  +
From _your point of view_, the discussion is the most important thing.  +
It is very helpful for you if other people criticize (v.) your work: [in that way] you can improve it.

[.my2]
首先，如果论文相当长，可能没有足够的时间进行讨论。从你的角度来看，讨论是最重要的。如果其他人批评你的工作，这对你非常有帮助：这样你就可以改进它。

Secondly, a lot of information can be understood when one is reading. It is not so easy to pick up detailed information when one is listening.   In other words, there may be lack of comprehension or understanding.

[.my2]
其次，阅读时可以理解很多信息。当一个人在听的时候，要获取详细的信息并不是那么容易的。换句话说，可能缺乏理解或理解。

Thirdly, it can be very boring listening to something 后定 being read aloud.  +
Anyway 不管怎样，无论如何 some of your audience may have read your paper carefully and will not thank you for having to go through all of it again.

[.my2]
第三，听大声朗读的内容, 可能会很无聊。不管怎样，你的一些读者可能已经仔细阅读了你的论文，并且不会感谢你必须再次阅读所有内容。

Therefore, what you must do is follow the following nine points:

[.my2]
因此，你必须做到以下九点：

Decide 决定；选定 on _a time limit_ for your talk. Tell your audience what it is.  +
Stick to your _time limit_. This is very important.

[.my2]
确定演讲的时间限制。告诉你的听众这是什么。遵守你的时间限制。这个非常重要。

Write out your _spoken presentation_ 口头陈述 in the way that you intend to say it.  +
This means that you must do some of the work of writing the paper again, in a sense 在某种意义上.  +

You may think that this is a waste of time, but it isn’t.  +
If a speaker tries to make a summary of his paper while he is standing in front of his audience 观众，听众；读者, the results are usually disastrous.

[.my2]
按照您想要的方式, 写下您的口头演讲。从某种意义上来说，这意味着你必须重新做一些写论文的工作。您可能认为这是浪费时间，但事实并非如此。如果演讲者试图在听众面前总结他的论文，结果通常是灾难性的。
