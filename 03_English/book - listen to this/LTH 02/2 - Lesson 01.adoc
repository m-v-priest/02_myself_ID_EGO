== 01

'This Is Your Life' is one of the most popular programmes on British and American television. Every week a famous person is invited to a television studio, without knowing that he or she will be the subject  主题；题目；话题 of the programme. The compère （电视节目等的）主持人 meets the person outside the studio and says 'This is your life!' The person then meets friends and relatives from his or her past and present. Studio 4 is where the programme is recorded. The programme begins at eight o'clock. It's 6:45 now and the director is checking the preparations with his new production assistant (PA) 生产助理,制片助理. The subject of tonight's show will be an actor, Jason Douglas. The compère 主持人, as usual, will be Terry Donovan. +

Director （某一活动的）负责人;导演: Let's just check the arrangements. We're bringing Jason Douglas here in a studio car — he thinks he's coming to a discussion programme! The driver has been told to arrive at exactly 7:55. Now, the programme begins at eight o'clock. At that time Jason will be walking to the studio. Terry Donovan will start his introduction at 8:01, and Jason will arrive at 8:02. Terry will meet him at the studio entrance ... Camera 4 will be there. Then he'll take him to that seat. It'll be on Camera 3. Jason will be sitting there during the whole programme. For most of the show Terry will be standing in the middle, and he'll be on Camera 2. The guests will come through that door, talk to Terry and Jason ... and then sit over there. +

Director: Now, is that all clear? +
PA: Yes ... there's just one thing. +
Director: Well, what is it? +
PA: Who's going to look after the guests during the show? +
Director: Pauline is. +
PA: And where will they be waiting during the show? +
Director: In Room 401, as usual. Pauline will be waiting with them, and she'll be watching the show on the monitor. She'll tell them two minutes before they enter. +
PA: I think that's everything. +
Terry: Good evening and welcome to 'This is Your Life'. This is Terry Donovan speaking. We're waiting for the subject of tonight's programme. He's one of the world's leading actors, and he thinks he's coming here to take part in a discussion programme ... I can hear him now ... yes, here he is! Jason Douglas ... This is your life! +
Jason: Oh, no ... I don't believe it! Not me ... +
Terry: Yes, you! Now come over here and sit down. Jason, you were born at number 28 Balaclava Street in East Ham, London on July 七月 2nd, 1947. You were one of six children, and your father was a taxi driver. Of course, your name was then Graham Smith. +
Terry: Now, do you know this voice? 'I remember Jason when he was two. He used to scream and shout all day.' +
Jason: Susan! +
Terry: Yes ... all the way from 从远方来  Sydney, Australia ... She flew here specially for this programme. It's your sister, Susan Fraser! +
Jason: Susan ... Why didn't you tell me ... oh, this is wonderful! +
Terry: Yes, you haven't seen each other for 13 years ... take a seat next to him, Susan. You started school at the age of five, in 1952, and in 1958 you moved to Lane End Secondary School 中等学校；中学. +
Terry: Do you remember this voice? 'Smith! Stop looking out of the window!' +
Jason: Oh, no! It's Mr. Hooper! +
Terry: Your English teacher, Mr. Stanley Hooper. Was Jason a good student, Mr. Hooper? +
Mr. Hooper: Eh? No, he was the worst in the class ... but he was a brilliant actor, even in those days. He could imitate 模仿；仿效 all the teachers? +
Terry: Thank you, Mr. Hooper. You can speak to Jason, later. Well, you went to the London School of Drama 戏；剧 in 1966, and left in 1969. In 1973 you went to Hollywood. +
Terry: Do you know this voice? 'Hi Jason ... Can you ride a horse yet?' +
Jason: Maria 玛丽亚! +
Terry: Maria Montrose ... who's come from Hollywood to be with you tonight. +
Maria: Hello, Jason ... it's great to be here. Hello, Terry. Jason and I were in a movie together in 1974. Jason had to learn to ride a horse ... Well, Jason doesn't like horses very much. +
Jason: Like them! I'm terrified (a.)恐惧；很害怕 of them! +
Maria: Anyway, he practised for two weeks. Then he went to the director ... it was Charles Orson ... and said, 'What do you want me to do?' Charles said, 'I want you to fall off the horse'. Jason was furious. He said, 'What? Fall off! I've been practising for two weeks ... I could fall off the first day ... without any practice!'

泰瑞:你知道这个声音吗?“嗨，杰森……你会骑马了吗?” +
杰森:玛丽亚! +

玛丽亚:你好，杰森，很高兴来到这里。你好,特里。1974年，杰森和我一起拍了一部电影。Jason必须学会骑马，Jason不太喜欢马。 +
杰森:喜欢他们!我害怕他们! +
玛丽亚:不管怎样，他练习了两个星期。然后他找到导演查尔斯·奥森，问他:“你想让我做什么?”查尔斯说:“我要你从马上摔下来。”杰森气坏了。他说，‘什么?掉下来!“我已经练习了两个星期了……第一天我就会摔下来……不练习!” +

Announcer ）广播员，播音员: And now, at 10:50 it's time for "In Your Own Words", in which we interview people with unusual stories to tell. Here to introduce the programme is Patricia Newell. Good morning, Patricia. +
Patricia: Good morning, and good morning everyone. With me in the studio now is this morning's guest, Trevor Cartridge. Good morning, Trevor. +
Trevor: Good morning, Patricia. +
Patricia: Trevor, you have one of the most unusual stories I've ever heard. Yet, nowadays, you seem to lead  过（某种生活） a very ordinary life. +
Trevor: Yes, Patricia. I'm a dentist. I live and work in London. +
Patricia: But at one time 曾经 you used to have a different job? +
Trevor: Yes, I was a soldier. +
Patricia: A soldier? +
Trevor: That's right. +
Patricia: And how long ago was that? +
Trevor: Oh, about two thousand years ago. +
Patricia: That's right. Trevor Cartridge believes that he was a soldier in the army of Julius Caesar 尤利乌斯•凯撒. He remembers coming to Britain with the Roman army two thousand years ago. Trevor, tell us your remarkable story ... in your own words! +
Trevor: Well, funnily enough, it all began because I wanted to give up smoking. +
Patricia: Give up smoking! +
Trevor: Mm, I used to smoke too much and I tried to give up several times, but I always started smoking again a few days later. In the end I went to a hypnotist 施催眠术的人. He hypnotized  对（某人）施催眠术 me, and I stopped smoking at once. I was delighted, as you can imagine. +
Patricia: Yes? +
Trevor: That made me very interested in hypnotism 催眠术；催眠, and I talked to the hypnotist about it. He told me that some people could remember their past lives when they were hypnotized, and he asked if I wanted to try. I didn't believe it at first, but in the end I agreed. He hypnotized me, and sure enough, I remembered. I was a Roman soldier in Caesar's army. +
Patricia: You didn't believe it at first? +
Trevor: I didn't believe it before we tried the experiment 实验；试验;尝试；实践. Now I'm absolutely convinced (a.)坚信；深信；确信 it's true. +
Patricia: What do you remember? +
Trevor: Oh, all kinds of things, but the most interesting thing I remember is the night we landed in Britain. +
Patricia: You remember that? +
Trevor: Oh yes. It was a terrible, stormy night. There were a hundred or more of us in the boat. We were all shut in 把…关在房间里, because the weather was so bad and most people were sick, because it was very stuffy (a.)闷热的；闷人的；通风不畅的. There was a terrible smell of petrol, I remember. Lots of men thought we should go back to France. It wasn't called 'France' then, of course. +
Patricia: And there was a smell of petrol? +
Trevor: Yes, it was terrible. The weather got worse and worse. We thought we were going to die. In the end the boat was pushed up 突出；突起 onto the sands, and we climbed out. I remember jumping into the water and struggling to the beach. The water was up to my shoulders and it was a freezing  极冷的;冰冻的；冰点以下的 night. A lot of men were killed by the cold or drowned （使）淹死，溺死 in the storm, but I managed to get ashore 向（或在）岸上；向（或在）陆地. +
Patricia: You did? +
Trevor: Yes. There were about ten survivors from our boat, but even then our troubles weren't over. We found a farmhouse, but it was deserted 无人居住的；空寂无人的;被抛弃的；被遗弃的. When the people read the newspapers, and knew that we were coming, they were terrified. They took all their animals and all their food, and ran away into the hills. Of course, there were no proper roads in those days. Well, we went into the house and tried to light a fire, but we couldn't even do that. We always kept matches 火柴 in our trousers' 裤子 pockets, so naturally they were all soaked 浸湿. We couldn't find anything to eat, except one tin of cat food. We were so hungry, we broke it open with our knives, and ate it. We found a tap  水龙头；旋塞, but the water was frozen. In the end we drank rainwater from the tin. We sat very close together and tried to keep warm. We could hear wolves but we didn't have any weapons, because our guns were full of seawater. By the morning, the storm was over. We went on to 做完一件事后继续做另外一件事  the beach and found what was left of the boat. We managed to find some food, and we hoped there was some wine too, but when we opened the box all the bottles were broken. +

Patricia: So what happened? +
Trevor: We waited. Finally another boat came and took us away, and we joined the other soldiers. I remember going into the camp, and getting a hot meal, and clean clothes. It was wonderful. We were given our pay, too. I remember the date on the coins, 50 BC. It was an exciting time. +
Patricia: And did you stay in Britain? +
Trevor: Oh yes, I was here for five years, from 50 BC to 55 BC. I enjoyed my stay in Britain very much. +
Patricia: And then you went back to Rome? +
Trevor: I can't remember anything after that. +
Patricia: Well, Trevor Cartridge, thank you for telling us your story, in your own words.

播音员:现在，10:50是“用你自己的话说”的时间，在这个节目中，我们将采访那些讲述不同寻常故事的人。Patricia Newell为您介绍本期节目。早上好，帕特丽夏。 +
帕特丽夏:早上好，大家早上好。现在和我一起在演播室的是今早的嘉宾特雷弗·卡迪尔。早上好，特雷弗。 +
Trevor:早上好，Patricia。 +
帕特里夏:特雷弗，你的故事是我听过的最不寻常的故事之一。然而，现在，你似乎过着非常平凡的生活。 +
Trevor:是的，Patricia。我是牙医。我在伦敦生活和工作。 +
帕特丽夏:但是你曾经做过一份不同的工作? +
特雷弗:是的，我当过兵。 +
帕特丽夏:士兵? +
特雷弗:没错。 +
帕特丽夏:那是多久以前的事了? +
哦，大约两千年前。 +
帕特丽夏:没错。特雷弗·卡迪尔认为他是凯撒大帝麾下的一名士兵。他记得两千年前随罗马军队来到英国。特雷弗，告诉我们你非凡的故事……用你自己的话! +
特雷弗:嗯，有趣的是，这一切都是从我想戒烟开始的。 +
帕特丽夏:戒烟吧! +
Trevor:嗯，我以前抽得太多了，我试过几次戒烟，但我总是在几天后又开始抽烟。最后我去找了个催眠师。他给我催眠，我立刻戒了烟。你可以想象，我很高兴。 +
帕特丽夏:是吗? +
特雷弗:这让我对催眠术很感兴趣，我和催眠师谈过这个问题。他告诉我，有些人在被催眠的情况下可以回忆起他们的前世，他问我是否想试试。起初我不相信，但最后我还是同意了。他催眠了我，果然，我记起来了。我是凯撒军队里的罗马士兵。 +
帕特丽夏:你一开始不相信? +
特雷弗:在我们做实验之前我都不相信。现在我完全相信这是真的。 +
帕特丽夏:你还记得什么? +
特雷弗:哦，各种各样的事情，但我记得最有趣的是我们降落在英国的那天晚上。 +
帕特丽夏:你还记得吗? +
Trevor:哦，是的。那是一个可怕的暴风雨之夜。我们有一百多人在船上。我们都被关在屋里，因为天气很糟糕，大多数人都生病了，因为空气很闷。我记得有股难闻的汽油味。很多人认为我们应该回法国。当然，那时候还不叫“法国”。 +
帕特丽夏:有汽油味吗? +
Trevor:是的，很糟糕。天气越来越差了。我们以为我们要死了。最后，船被推到沙滩上，我们爬了出来。我记得我跳进水里，挣扎着游到海滩上。水没过我的肩膀，这是一个寒冷的夜晚。许多人冻死或在暴风雨中淹死，但我设法上岸了。 +
帕特丽夏:是吗? +
特雷弗:是的。我们的船上大约有十个幸存者，但即使这样，我们的麻烦还没有结束。我们找到了一所农舍，但它是空的。当人们读了报纸，知道我们要来的时候，他们都吓坏了。他们带着所有的牲畜和食物，逃到山里去了。当然，那时候还没有像样的道路。我们进了房子，想生个火，但我们都做不到。我们总是把火柴放在裤子口袋里，所以火柴自然都湿透了。除了一罐猫粮，我们找不到任何吃的东西。我们太饿了，就用刀子把它掰开吃了。我们找到了一个水龙头，但水已经结冰了。最后我们喝了罐子里的雨水。我们靠得很近，尽量保持温暖。我们能听到狼的声音，但我们没有任何武器，因为我们的枪里装满了海水。到了早晨，暴风雨过去了。我们走到海滩上，找到了船的残骸。我们设法找到了一些食物，我们也希望有一些酒，但是当我们打开盒子时，所有的瓶子都碎了。 +
帕特丽夏:那发生了什么? +
特雷弗:我们等着。最后，另一艘船来了，把我们带走了，我们加入了其他士兵的行列。我记得进了营地，吃了一顿热饭，穿了干净的衣服。太棒了。我们也拿到了工资。我记得硬币上的日期，公元前50年。那是一段激动人心的时光。 +
帕特丽夏:那你在英国待过吗? +
Trevor:哦，是的，我在这里待了五年，从公元前50年到公元前55年。我在英国过得很愉快。 +
帕特丽夏:然后你就回罗马了? +
特雷弗:之后的事我都不记得了。 +
帕特丽夏:Trevor Cartridge，谢谢你用自己的话给我们讲述你的故事。 +

== The Knowledge +

Becoming a London taxi driver isn't easy. In order to obtain a licence to drive a taxi in London, candidates 候选人，申请人 have to pass a detailed examination. They have to learn not only the streets, landmarks and hotels, but also the quickest way to get there. This is called 'The Knowledge' by London cab drivers and it can take years of study and practice to get 'The Knowledge'. Candidates are examined not only on the quickest routes but also on the quickest routes at different times of the day. People who want to pass the examination spend much of their free time driving or even cycling 骑自行车运动（或活动） around London, studying maps and learning the huge street directory 街道指南 by heart.
