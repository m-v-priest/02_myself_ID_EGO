B.
Monologue.

My husband and I don't like the schools in our area. We don't think the teachers are very good, and the children don't learn very much. Some children at these schools can't read, it's terrible. Go to the schools and look: the children fight(v.); some of them even smoke and drink. No, our children can have a better education at home with us. After all, we are both teachers.

[.my1]

- monologue (n.) （戏剧、电影等的）独白 ;/ 滔滔不绝的讲话；个人的长篇大论

我丈夫和我不喜欢我们地区的学校。我们认为老师不是很好，孩子们也学不到很多东西。这些学校的一些孩子不识字，这太可怕了。
