- 表盘左侧用to,右侧用past
-> ten past nine = 9:10 +
-> fifteen past nine 或 a quarter past nine = 9:15 +
-> half past eleven = 11:30 +
-> twenty-five to nine = 8:35  <= *(相差的)分钟＋to＋(下一)小时 : 是差几分种就到几点了* +
-> fifteen to ten 或 a quarter to ten = 9:45
-> ten to twelve = 11:50 +

其实, 能简单用就不要复杂！ +
-> five fifty = 5:50 +
-> four twenty = 4:20 +
-> 9:15 = nine fifteen ; fifteen past nine ; a quarter past nine  +
-> 3:45 = three forty-five ; fifteen to four ; a quarter to four
