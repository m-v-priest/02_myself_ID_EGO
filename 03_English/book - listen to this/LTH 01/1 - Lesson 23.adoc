== Section 1

==== A. Dialogue 1:

Mr. Hanson: Could I have my bill, please? +
Waitress: Yes, sir. One moment, please.

(She brings the bill and the customer looks at it carefully.) +
Mr. Hanson: Could you kindly explain this to me? What is item 6? +
Waitress: Perhaps I could go through it for you. The first item is the cover charge. Number
2 is the beer. Then your starter, your main course and the vegetables. The main course
was 4.50 not 3.50, so item 6 is the difference.


[.my1]
====

- difference  ~ (in sth) (between A and B)  :the amount that sth is greater or smaller than sth else 差；差额 +
-> I'll lend you ￡500 and you'll have to find the difference (= the rest of the money that you need) . 我借给你500英镑，其余的你自己解决。

Mr. Hanson: Oh, I see. But how was I expected to know that? +
Waitress: Yes, sir. They are a bit hard to follow sometimes. Number 8 is your dessert and
number 9 the cigarettes. Oh, and number 7 is your second beer. +
Mr. Hanson: And what about the service, is that included? +
Waitress: Yes, that's marked down here, 10 per cent service. +
Mr. Hanson: Good. Thank you. Now, can you take my credit card? +
Waitress: I'm afraid we don't accept credit cards. +
Mr. Hanson: Oh dear. What about a cheque with a banker's card? +
Waitress: Yes, sir. That will be all right. +

Customer: That's all right. No harm done. Now, can I pay by traveler's cheques? +
Waiter: Certainly, sir. We'll give you the change in local currency if that's all right. +

==== A. On a London Bus.

So he stood up and rang the bell. To make sure the driver heard him /he rang it twice, but
the bus didn't stop, and the conductor came and shouted at him. +
The conductor was so annoyed, and spoke so fast, that Henri didn't understand a
word. The bus stopped at the next bus stop and Henri got off. As he got off he heard
someone say, "I think he's a foreigner." +
When Henri got home, he told his landlady about the incident. +
"How many times did you ring the bell?" she asked. +
"Twice," said Henri. +
"Well, that's the signal for the driver to go on," his landlady explained. "Only the
conductor is allowed to ring the bell twice. That's why he got so annoyed." +
Henri nodded. "I see," he said.

==== D. The Smuggler.

Sam Lewis was a customs officer. He *used(v.) to* work in a small border town. It wasn't a
busy town and there wasn't much work. The road was usually very quiet and there weren't
many travelers. It wasn't a very interesting job, but Sam liked an easy life.

About once a
week, he used to meet an old man. His name was Draper. He always used to arrive at the
border early in the morning in a big truck. The truck was always empty. After a while Sam
became suspicious. He often used to search the truck, but he never found anything. One
day he asked Draper about his job. Draper laughed and said, "I'm a smuggler."

Last year Sam retired. He spent his savings on an expensive holiday. He flew to
Bermuda, and stayed in a luxury hotel. One day, he was sitting by the pool and opposite
him he saw Draper drinking champagne. Sam walked over to him.  +

==== E. Missing Children.

The first thing they do is to put out an APB and this goes to all the police stations in
the country.  +
Next we contact the hospitals. Often the person we are looking for has been
in an accident.  +
Then we might try parents, friends or relatives they might be with.  +
We try to follow their movements and to find the last person they saw or were with.  +
Then we try the media. We put photographs in local or national papers —especially papers they might read. +

There are other things we can do: put posters in places they might be, go on television.
Here in America there is a magazine in which there are photographs of missing children.
This is often the last hope.  +

Of course, with nearly two million missing children every year, we can't do all these things for everyone. We haven't got the time, the money or the staff.

== Section 3

==== Dictation.

Are you a morning person or an evening person? That's the question. When do you work best? For me the answer is easy. I work best in the morning. All my creative work is done before lunchtime. I get up at about eight, and then have breakfast. I listen to the radio a bit, and read the papers. And I start. Usually I work from nine or nine thirty until twelve but after that I'm useless.

On a good day I write fifteen hundred words or more, sometimes two thousand words, in the morning. Then after lunch I go for a walk, or read. In the evening I like to relax, go to the pub or go out and meet people.

If you're a writer you need self-discipline. But if you're tired, it shows: the mind and body must be fresh.
