Early this morning, `主` the _presiding officer_ 主持人,议长 of the Senate, who was at that time Senator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa, `谓` summoned 传唤；召集 Senators to a historic occasion （某事发生的）时刻，时候, a trial in the Senate. +
The Senate will now proceed 继续做（或从事、进行）, he said, as a court of impeachment.

[.my2]
今天一早，参议院主持人，当时是爱荷华州共和党参议员查尔斯·格拉斯利（Charles Grassley），召集参议员们出席一场历史性的场合——在参议院进行的审判。他表示，"参议院"现在将作为"弹劾法庭"继续进行。



"The Sergeant 陆军（或空军）中士 at Arms will make the proclamation 宣言；公告；声明." "All persons are commanded 命令 (v.) to keep silence, on pain of 违则受到某种惩罚；违则以…论处 imprisonment 监禁，关押 while _the House of Representatives_ 众议院 is exhibiting _the Senate of the United States_ articles of impeachment against Judge harry E.

The defense, Judge Claiborne and his attorneys, including a former Senator, Howard Cannon of Nevada. +
The two tables face (v.) the one hundred desks of the Senators who will serve as judge and jury in this trial.

[.my2]
当参议员们陆续进场时，他们看到在参议院的井字处摆放着长桌，其中坐着控方和辩方。控方是众议院的成员，他们根据"宪法条款", 向参议院展示"弹劾条款"。而辩方则包括克莱伯恩法官及其律师，其中包括内华达州的前参议员霍华德·坎农（Howard Cannon）。这两张桌子面对着参议员们的一百张桌子，在这场审判中, 他们将担任"法官"和"陪审团"。

The attorney for the defense led off 起始于（某地）;开始（某事） with some _prefatory 前言的；序文的 remarks_.

Oscar Goodman told the Senate that Judge Claiborne insisted on this trial because he believes that he is innocent. +
But _the center of the argument_ made by Judge Claiborne's attorney is that the judge was rail-roaded (v.)被迫快速通过，被强行推进 into prison by over enthusiastic prosecution.

[.my2]
辩方的律师首先进行了一些开场白。奥斯卡·古德曼（Oscar Goodman）告诉参议院，克莱伯恩法官坚持要进行这次审判，因为他相信自己是无辜的。但克莱伯恩法官的律师提出的主要论点是，法官是被过度热情的控方, 逼入囹圄的。


"He has been caught in the vortex 感情（或局势）的旋涡 of a constitutional crisis, a situation that has to affect every member of this body, because, God forbid, it could happen to them where Judge Claiborne became victimized （因种族、性别、信仰等）使受不公平对待，使受害 as a result of a vendetta 积怨；宿怨；长期不和;家族世仇；团伙仇杀 of the Justice Department, and _the strike force_, and _a special agent_ 特工 in charge of the FBI who came to the Nevada desert to bury the American flag there."


[.my2]
他被卷入了宪法危机的漩涡中，这是一个会影响到本体每个成员的情况，因为如果上帝不允许，这种情况可能会发生在他们身上，克莱伯恩法官成为了"司法部，打击力量, 以及联邦调查局的特别探员"的复仇的受害者，这些人来到内华达沙漠, 就是为了在那里埋葬美国国旗。


_Attorney Goodman's charge_ (n.) was answered (v.) in prefatory remarks again by Congressman Henry Hide of Illinois, a member of the House, in effect acting for the prosecution.

"Judge Claiborne isn't here because of any alleged misconduct by the government.  +
He's here because he was tried and convicted beyond a reasonable doubt given the presumption of innocence by a jury of twelve people.

[.my2]
古德曼律师的指控, 再次在伊利诺伊州众议员亨利·海德（Henry Hyde）的开场白中得到了回应，他是众议院的成员，实际上代表控方行动。克莱伯恩法官并不是因为政府被指控的不当行为而在这里。他之所以在这里是因为他经过了一次合理怀疑的审判, 和被十二人陪审团以无罪推定的情况下被判定有罪。

His motion for a new trial was denied, his appeal to the ninth circuit was denied, his motion for rehearing and ban was denied, and his Writ of Certiorari to the Supreme Court was denied. That's why he's here."

[.my2]
他的请求重新审判被拒绝了，他向第九巡回法庭上诉被拒绝了，他的再审和禁令请求被拒绝了，他向最高法院提交的撤销令也被拒绝了。这就是他为什么在这里。





Judge Claiborne was convicted of income tax evasion, willfully filing false returns which failed to report hundreds of thousands of dollars of income.

Claiborne's defense is that he make a mistake but did not commit a crime, and further the prosecutors pursued of a vendetta against him. +
Members of the House argued that whatever the prosecutors' conduct, it is Claiborne who is on trial in the Senate.

[.my2]
克莱伯恩法官因逃税罪被判有罪，故意提交虚假的申报表，未报告数十万美元的收入。克莱伯恩的辩护是, 他犯了错误, 但并没有犯罪，并且控方对他进行了复仇。众议院的成员们争辩说，无论控方的行为如何，克莱伯恩才是参议院审判的对象。

Congressman Peter Rodino, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee argued that Judge Claiborne's contention that he made a mistake is simply not credible.

"According to Judge Claiborne, an individual can hire the most incompetent tax preparer, participate in the most irresponsible treatment of basic tax concepts, create sales of assets that do not exist, fail even to bother to read the return, enjoy a refund of thousands of dollars, and simply wait for an audit."

[.my2]
众议院司法委员会主席彼得·罗迪诺（Peter Rodino）辩称，克莱伯恩法官声称自己犯了错误的说法, 根本不可信。据克莱伯恩法官所说，一个人可以聘请最不称职的纳税人准备者，参与对基本税收概念的最不负责任的处理，制造根本不存在的资产销售，甚至连读申报表都懒得读，享受数千美元的退税，然后简单地等待审计。

Late in the day, Judge Claiborne spoke in his own defense. +
"I wanted to talk to you." He said to the Senators. "I wanted you to see me. I feel," he said, "like a piece of meat torn between two dogs." "I want to be honest with every member of this body. I would much rather, right today, be almost any place than here. But I knew when I was convicted that this was the place that I had to come."

[.my2]
一天晚些时候，克莱伯恩法官为自己辩护。他对参议员们说：“我想和你们谈谈。我希望你们看到我。我感觉，”他说，“就像是被两只狗撕扯的肉块。”我想对本体的每个成员诚实。我宁愿，今天，几乎任何地方都不在这里。但我知道，当我被判有罪时，这是我必须来的地方。

Claiborne told the Senate that young Turks in the Justice Department are head hunters looking for prosecutions which will gain them the most publicity.

The Senate is deciding now in closed session what to do about the articles of impeachment against Judge Claiborne. +
Impeachment requires a two-thirds votes of the members present.

I'm Linda Wertheimer at the Capitol.

[.my2]
克莱伯恩告诉参议院，司法部的年轻人是猎头，他们正在寻找可以为他们带来最多公众关注的起诉案。参议院现在正在闭门会议中, 决定对克莱伯恩法官的弹劾条款采取什么行动。弹劾需要出席的成员的三分之二多数票通过。我是琳达·沃思默，在国会报道。

Most information on the movement of nuclear weapons in this country is classified for reasons of security.

[.my2]
出于安全原因，有关该国核武器流动的大多数信息都是保密的。

But some new details are becoming public that suggest that the transporting of nuclear weapons for maintenance and production is much more frequent than is generally known.

[.my2]
但一些新的细节正在公开，表明用于维护和生产的核武器的运输比人们普遍知道的要频繁得多。

NPR's David Malthus reports that on any given day, it is likely that US nuclear weapons are being transported on the nation's highways, in the air, and at sea.

[.my2]
美国国家公共广播电台的大卫·马尔萨斯报道说，在任何一天，美国的核武器都可能在国家的高速公路、空中和海上运输。

America's nuclear arsenal is constantly in flux.

[.my2]
美国的核武库不断变化。

Older warheads are retired and dismantled as new ones are built.

[.my2]
旧弹头随着新弹头的建造而退役和拆除。

Some elements of nuclear bombs, like radio active tritium becomes stale over time and must be refurbished.

[.my2]
核弹的某些元素，如放射性氚，随着时间的推移会变得陈旧，必须翻新。

There are changes in storage sites, quality control checks.

[.my2]
储存地点、质量控制检查都有变化。

This routine maintenance and production requires frequent movement of nuclear weapons and components.

[.my2]
这种日常维护和生产需要核武器及其部件的频繁移动。

It is accomplished through a large transportation network that includes specially designated cargo planes of the Air Force, freighters under the control of the Navy, and a fleet of highway tractor trailer rigs operated by the Department of Energy.

[.my2]
它是通过大型运输网络来实现的，其中包括空军专门指定的货机、海军控制下的货机以及能源部运营的公路牵引车拖车车队。

DOE, which oversees the production, assembly, and testing of nuclear weapons, has forty-five custom-built trucks to transport the weapons to more than one hundred military installations in twenty-two states.

[.my2]
美国能源部负责监督核武器的生产、组装和测试，拥有 45 辆定制卡车，用于将武器运输到 22 个州的 100 多个军事设施。

Headquarters for the transport operations is Albuquerque, New Mexico.

[.my2]
运输业务总部位于新墨西哥州阿尔伯克基。

Department spokesman Ben McCarty says the truck fleet logs over four million miles a year hauling their special cargo.

[.my2]
该部门发言人本·麦卡蒂表示，卡车车队每年运输特殊货物的里程超过四百万英里。

"They'll be carrying nuclear weapons, special nuclear materials, such as plutonium or highly enriched uranium and classified non-nuclear components of nuclear weapons." Once delivered to military storage facilities, the weapons often are then transported by air or ship to bases around the world.

[.my2]
“它们将携带核武器、特殊核材料，例如钚或高浓缩铀以及核武器的机密非核部件。”一旦运送到军事储存设施，这些武器通常会通过空运或海运运往世界各地的基地。

The military, following standard practice, refuses to discuss its nuclear transportation operations.

[.my2]
按照标准做法，军方拒绝讨论其核运输业务。

However, the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal research group based in Washington, has used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain military documents on those operations.

[.my2]
然而，总部位于华盛顿的自由主义研究团体政策研究所已利用《信息自由法》获取有关这些行动的军事文件。

They were made available to NPR.

[.my2]
它们已向 NPR 公开。

Air Force Memoranda state that nuclear weapons are transported, "almost on a daily basis." The military airlift command refers to these missions as "the bully beef express." The Air Force documents show that last year the bully beef crews flew more than a thousand nuclear weapons flights.

[.my2]
空军备忘录指出，核武器的运输“几乎每天都有”。军事空运司令部将这些任务称为“霸道牛肉快递”。空军文件显示，去年霸牛航空机组人员进行了一千多次核武器飞行。

Recently, the Navy revealed, perhaps inadvertently, in public documents, information that indicates some of its nuclear weapons are ferried across the Atlantic in commercial cargo ships operated by civilians.

[.my2]
最近，美国海军可能无意地在公开文件中披露了一些信息，表明其一些核武器是通过民用商业货船运送到大西洋彼岸的。

The ships reportedly carry a small contingent of Navy personnel for security and communications, but it appears that the freighters rely heavily on their anonymity for security.

[.my2]
据报道，这些船只载有一小队海军人员用于安全和通信，但货船似乎严重依赖他们的匿名性来保证安全。

William Arkin of the Institute for Policy Studies has done intensive research on the transportation of nuclear weapons.

[.my2]
政策研究所的威廉·阿金对核武器的运输进行了深入研究。

"We live with the illusion that nuclear weapons are safely secured away, all in underground missile silos in South Dakota and Montana and Wyoming.

[.my2]
“我们抱有这样的幻想：核武器被安全地存放在南达科他州、蒙大拿州和怀俄明州的地下导弹发射井中。

And instead, we see a system which requires constant care and feeding, repair, constant movement, which comes into contact with the soldiers and civilian technicians on a daily basis." Arkin points out that each year, several thousand military and civilian personnel handling nuclear weapons are permanently disqualified for such duty because of alcohol abuse, use of illegal drugs, and other personal problems.

[.my2]
相反，我们看到的是一个需要不断护理、供给、维修、不断移动的系统，它每天都会与士兵和文职技术人员接触。”阿尔金指出，每年都有数千名军事和文职人员处理核问题。由于酗酒、使用非法药物和其他个人问题，武器永久丧失履行此类职责的资格。

But defense officials say this is a sign of the military's diligence, not danger.

[.my2]
但国防官员表示，这是军方勤奋的表现，而不是危险。

Of the one hundred thousand nuclear weapons handlers, about thirty-three hundred lost their clearances last year.

[.my2]
去年，在十万名核武器处理者中，约有三千三百人失去了许可。

The most disqualified in any recent year has been five thousand.

[.my2]
近年来被取消资格最多的有五千人。

But human and mechanical failures have caused serious problems in the past.

[.my2]
但过去，人为和机械故障曾造成严重问题。

The Defense Department says there have been thirty-two accidents involving nuclear weapons, the last one in 1980.

[.my2]
国防部表示，已发生 32 起涉及核武器的事故，最后一次发生在 1980 年。

At least ten caused leakage of radioactive materials.

[.my2]
至少有十起造成放射性物质泄漏。

None has caused a nuclear explosion.

[.my2]
没有一次引起核爆炸。

Spokesman Ben McCarty of the Department of Energy says nuclear weapons trucks have been involved in eleven accidents over the years, mainly from icy roads which caused the trucks to flip over.

[.my2]
美国能源部发言人本·麦卡蒂表示，多年来，核武器卡车已发生 11 起事故，主要是由于道路结冰导致卡车翻车。

But he says there's never been any danger to the public.

[.my2]
但他表示，公众从未遇到过任何危险。

"We have never had an accident that resulted in a release of radio-activity from one of these trucks or in any damage to the cargo in these trucks." Air Force documents show that pilots transporting nuclear weapons today are told to avoid flying over heavily populated areas to the maximum extent possible.

[.my2]
“我们从未发生过导致其中一辆卡车释放放射性或对这些卡车中的货物造成任何损坏的事故。”空军文件显示，如今运输核武器的飞行员被告知要尽可能避免飞越人口稠密的地区。

General D.H.  D.H.将军

Cassidy of the Military Airlift Command praised the "bully beef express" for its outstanding safety record in an internal memo last year.

[.my2]
军事空运司令部的卡西迪在去年的一份内部备忘录中赞扬了“霸王牛肉快递”出色的安全记录。

But he also warned the crews about complacency after Air Force personnel mentioned on a non-secure telephone the nature of the cargo on two nuclear weapons flight.

[.my2]
但他也警告机组人员不要自满，因为空军人员在非安全电话中提到了两架核武器航班上货物的性质。

Military Airlift Command Regulation No.

[.my2]
军事空运指挥条例第 1 号

55-141 tells the crews how to respond to a hijacking attempt.

[.my2]
55-141 告诉机组人员如何应对劫机企图。

"Never allow a hostile force to capture or control a nuclear weapon," it says, "even if it means risking the lives of any hostages that might have been taken." The regulation instructs the crews on when to use CDS—the command disable system, which is attached to some nuclear weapons.

[.my2]
报告称：“绝不允许敌对势力夺取或控制核武器，即使这意味着冒着可能被劫持的人质生命危险。”该规定指导机组人员何时使用 CDS——一些核武器上附带的命令禁用系统。

"CDS," the regulation says, "internally destroys the capability of a weapon to achieve a significant nuclear yield." "As a last resort," the regulation says, "nuclear weapons must be destroyed even if it means loss of the aircraft.

[.my2]
该法规称，“CDS 从内部摧毁了武器实现显着核当量的能力。”该规定称：“作为最后的手段，核武器必须被销毁，即使这意味着飞机的损失。”

The department of Energy says it too takes great precautions against accidents or terrorist attacks.

[.my2]
能源部表示，它也采取了严格的预防措施来防止事故或恐怖袭击。

Spokesman Ben McCarty says the trucks that haul nuclear weapons across the country have armor-plated cabs.

[.my2]
发言人本·麦卡蒂表示，在全国范围内运输核武器的卡车都配有装甲驾驶室。

The drivers are trained and equipped with a number of firearms, and the trucks are escorted by additional armed guards in cars.

[.my2]
司机经过培训并配备了多种枪支，卡车上还有额外的武装警卫护送。

Ben McMarty, "We know where all the trucks are at all times, and we have both voice and data links to them.

[.my2]
Ben McMarty，“我们随时知道所有卡车的位置，并且我们有与它们的语音和数据链接。

And should anything happen to the shipments, the escort vehicles are able to communicate immediately with local or state law enforcement people and the full force of the military establishment should it be required." While the Department of Energy tries to keep these shipments secret, peace groups have penetrated that secrecy repeatedly.

[.my2]
如果货物发生任何情况，护送车辆能够立即与当地或州执法人员以及军事机构的全部力量进行联系（如果需要）。”虽然能源部试图对这些货物保密，但和平一些团体已多次突破这一秘密。

One group, Nuke Watch, has followed the nuclear trucks thousands of miles over the last two years.

[.my2]
Nuke Watch 组织在过去两年里追踪了核卡车数千英里。

Other anti-nuke activists line the roadsides and wave banners, alerting highway travellers that nuclear weapons are on the way.

[.my2]
其他反核武器活动人士在路边排列并挥舞横幅，警告公路旅行者核武器即将来临。

Sam Day, the founder of Nuke Watch says the trucks are not difficult to spot even though they are unmarked, with no warning of hazardous cargo.

[.my2]
Nuke Watch 的创始人 Sam Day 表示，这些卡车并不难被发现，尽管它们没有标记，也没有危险货物的警告。

"The trucks are eighteen wheel semi-trailers.

[.my2]
“这些卡车是十八轮半挂车。

They look a lot like the hundreds of thousands of other semis on the road.

[.my2]
它们看起来很像路上的数十万其他半挂车。

The trailers are metal colored.

[.my2]
拖车是金属色的。

They have peculiar radio antenna above the cab, which is the main way that you recognize them as H-bomb trucks." "When they spot you, do they take evasive action, try to lose you?" "They used to, yes.

[.my2]
他们的驾驶室上方有特殊的无线电天线，这是你认出他们是氢弹卡车的主要方式。” “当他们发现你时，他们会采取回避行动，试图失去你吗？” “他们曾经这样做过，是的。

They used to speed up to eighty-five miles an hour, make hairpin turns and generally play cowboy with us." Sam Day says now that the Energy Department knows who they are, the truck drivers no longer go out of their way to evade the Nuke Watch shadow.

[.my2]
他们过去常常加速到每小时八十五英里，急转弯，通常和我们一起玩牛仔。”萨姆·戴说，现在能源部知道他们是谁，卡车司机不再特意躲避核弹手表的影子。

The Department's Ben McMarty says Nuke Watch is more of a nuisance than anything else.

[.my2]
该部门的本·麦克马蒂 (Ben McMarty) 表示，Nuke Watch 比其他任何东西都更令人讨厌。

"The job of driving these rigs and protecting these rigs is in itself somewhat stressful.

[.my2]
“驾驶这些钻机和保护这些钻机的工作本身就有些压力。

These guys have to really, you know, at all times be on the lookout for anything unusual or any suspicious vehicles coming up on them, or things like this.

[.my2]
你知道，这些人必须时刻警惕任何异常情况或任何可疑车辆出现在他们身上，或者类似的事情。

And it adds to their stress load." The peace groups say they are not out to harass the truck convoys.

[.my2]
这增加了他们的压力。”和平组织表示，他们并不是要骚扰卡车车队。

Their purpose is to emotionalize the arms control issue.

[.my2]
他们的目的是使军备控制问题情绪化。

Says Nuke Watch Sam Day, "We want to bring home to people the fact that nuclear weapons are rolling through the streets and towns of America regularly." I'm David Malthus in Washington.
