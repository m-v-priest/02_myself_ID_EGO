`主` Two years of sensitive negotiations `谓` paid off 还清;(某行动) 取得成功; 带来好结果 today as `主` seventy former Cuban political prisoners 政治犯 `谓` arrived in the United States.

[.my2]
今天，70名古巴前政治犯抵达美国，为期两年的敏感谈判终见成效。 +

All of the prisoners had served least (在数量上) 至少 ten years in Cuban jails, and some had been in prison since Fidel Castro came to power in 1959.  +

The release was arranged in part by French underwater explorer, Jacques Cousteau, and a delegation 代表团 of American Roman Catholic bishops. 

[.my2]
他们此次获释，部分是由法国水下探险家，雅克·库斯托，和美国天主教主教的代表团安排。 +

President Reagan today unveiled （首次）展示，介绍，推出；将…公之于众 plans for nine hundred million dollar plan (n.) to reduce drug abuse in the United States.  +

It includes half a billion 十亿 dollars for stepping up 增加 drug enforcement along US borders, especially in the southwest.  +

[.my1]
====
.billion
(abbr. bn) 1 000 000 000; one thousand million 十亿 +
( old-fashioned) ( BrE ) 1 000 000 000 000; one million million 一万亿 +

在美国英语（American English）中，billion是我们熟知的“十亿”的意思，而在英国英语（British English）中，billion最先是指“万亿”。不过，从1974年开始，尽管仍有少数地区沿用着“万亿”的意思，大多数的英国官方媒体（比如BBC）开始使用“十亿”这个意思。 +
因此现在说到billion，一般是指美国的billion，也就是“十亿”。

billion 的值都是 latexmath:[ 10^9]（十亿） +
billion的意义也影响了 trillion、quadrillion、quintillion等的值。由此，trillion 目前在英语世界表示 latexmath:[10^{12}]

billion 等词语意义的变化, 对科学家和数学家来说从来就不是难题；他们通常以10的N次方来表示超大数值。
====

The plan also calls for mandatory 强制的；法定的；义务的 drug testing for some federal workers. 

[.my2]
该计划还要求对一些联邦工作人员, 进行强制性药物测试。  +

NPR's Brenda Wilson reports.  +

"As part of his national crusade  （长期坚定不移的）斗争，运动; （中世纪的）十字军东征 against drugs, President Reagan signed an executive order 行政命令 today requiring federal workers in sensitive positions to undergo 经历，经受（变化、不快的事等） drug tests.  +

The order covers employees who have access to classified 机密的；保密的 information, presidentially appointed officials, law enforcement  执法(机关或官员) officials, and any federal worker engaged 从事 in activities which affect public health and safety or national security.  +

[.my2]
该命令涵盖了涉密雇员，
总统任命的官员，执法官员，
以及从事影响公共卫生和安全或国家安全活动的任何联邦工作人员。 +

But heads of government agencies 政府机构 may order additional workers to take the test.  +

`主` Federal employees who are found to have continued to use illegal drugs after a second test `谓` will be automatically fired.  +

The overall rug testing program is expected to cost fifty-six million dollars, but administration officials could not get even a ballpark （数额的）变动范围；可量范围 figure of how many workers may be included in the mandatory 强制的；法定的；义务的 program.  +

[.my2]
整个药物检测计划预计要花费5600万美元，但政府官员甚至无法拿出一个大概数字，说清有多少雇员会被列入强制性检测计划。 +

[.my2]
入围作品由“威廉卡洛斯威廉姆斯诗歌大赛”的决赛选手创作，该大赛以美国伟大诗人命名，
这位新泽西乡村医生, 经常在他的处方页上创作诗稿。 +

William Carlos Williams wrote short, sometimes, and to the quick 触及要害；触及痛处.  +

This is just to say I have eaten the plums 李子；梅子 That were in the ice box, And which you were probably saving for breakfast.  +

So, it's fitting (a.)适合（某场合）的；恰当的 that the Northeastern Ohio University's College of Medicine should name (v.) its poetry competition for him.  +

Now, at the beginning of its fifth year, the competition is open to all medical students in this country, but just one percent of them, a few hundred or so 大约，左右, entered the competition.  +

"I'm sure a lot more are closet (a.)隐藏（身份等）的；不公开（个人信息）的 poets 诗人 and aren't willing yet to submit  提交，呈递（文件、建议等）. We hope they do."

Poetry by ten medical students is presented in the chapbook, accompanied by biographical (a.)传记的，生平的 notes on each of the poets.  +

[.my2]
我猜它是所有诗人的创作范畴，包括爱人和朋友以及悲伤的种种情况，
但（这些主题中）也包含有他们至亲的经历，那就是医学院本身，

Kurt Beal, at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, describes himself this way.  +

"I write to remember, to find, to uncover, to unfold （使）逐渐展现；展示；透露. 

[.my2]
我写作是为了去铭记，去发现，去揭示，去展开。 +

当我看你照见镜中的自己，宽衣时没有小心翼翼，有的只是呵护与关爱，
剥下泳衣，从肩膀及胸部，露出平坦的腹部，从肚脐到肋骨，
动作有序，宛如一座建筑。
臀部隆起，荡漾了我几何学者般的内心。 +

chatGpt : 弗吉尼亚医学院医学院的P.C.鲍曼（P.C. Bowman）写了《关于他妻子的地图绘制者》。当我看着你在镜子前自己观察时，脱衣不是谨慎而是小心翼翼，从肩膀和胸部剥下泳衣，暴露出从腹部的漩涡到肋骨的平坦，井然有序如建筑结构。臀部的膨胀让我的测绘者之心破碎。
