In addition to cutting its prime rate, Japan has agreed to coordinate its foreign exchange policy with the US Today is the first Monday in October, and that means the opening day of the new Supreme Court term.

[.my2]
除了下调最优惠利率外，日本还同意与美国协调外汇政策。今天是10月的第一个星期一，这意味着最高法院新任期的开始。

NPR's legal affairs correspondent, Nina Totenberg was at the court this morning when the gavel went down.

[.my2]
今天早上，当木槌落下时，NPR 法律事务记者 Nina Totenberg 正在法庭上。

Nina: "Well, as you know, by now, Terry, this was a rather special beginning with a new Chief Justice, William Rehnquist at the helm, and a new Justice, Antonin Scalia, in the junior Justice's chair." "So what was it like?" "Well, I gotta tell you.

[.my2]
尼娜：“好吧，正如你所知，特里，现在这是一个相当特别的开始，新任首席大法官威廉·伦奎斯特掌舵，新任大法官安东尼·斯卡利亚担任初级大法官。” “那么那是什么样子的呢？” “好吧，我得告诉你。

To someone who had never been at the court before, it may have looked quite normal.

[.my2]
对于以前从未去过法庭的人来说，这可能看起来很正常。

But to me, it was really quite strange.

[.my2]
但对我来说，这确实很奇怪。

Very weird, in fact.

[.my2]
事实上，非常奇怪。

For fifteen years, we watched this Court with Chief Justice Burger in the center of the bench.

[.my2]
十五年来，我们一直注视着首席大法官伯格坐在法官席中央的法庭。

And now the whole Court has played a kind of musical chairs, with justice Rehnquist, who used to sit at the far right, moving to the center to run the Court.

[.my2]
现在整个法院就像抢椅子一样，原来坐在最右边的法官伦奎斯特搬到了中间来管理法院。

Chief Justice Burger is gone.

[.my2]
首席大法官伯格去世了。

Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who I used to look across the room at and used to look rather placid to me across the room, is now sitting just over my shoulder above me.

[.my2]
桑德拉·戴·奥康纳法官（Sandra Day O'Connor），我曾经在房间的另一边看着他，在我看来他看起来相当平静，现在就坐在我的肩膀上方。

Chief Justice Rehnquist seemed a tad nervous as he opened the term this morning.

[.my2]
首席大法官伦奎斯特今天早上开庭时显得有点紧张。

As far as the new Justice, Antonin Scalia, he waited only about ten minutes during the first case argued this morning before he joined in peppering the lawyers with questions.

[.my2]
至于新任大法官安东尼·斯卡利亚(Antonin Scalia)，在今天早上的第一起案件辩论中，他只等了大约十分钟，就开始向律师们提出了很多问题。

Actually he started to ask a question even earlier, but was cut off by Justice O'Connor, and sort of hung back while a couple of other Justices asked questions.

[.my2]
事实上，他更早开始提问，但被奥康纳法官打断，在其他几位法官提问时有点犹豫。

And then, Justice Seebans, who sits next to Justice Scalia, looked at Scalia as if to say 'Okay Kid, your turn now.' "Well, I can report to you, in general, that the Justices looked well rested and rather pleased at the look of the new Court.

[.my2]
然后，坐在斯卡利亚法官旁边的西班斯法官看着斯卡利亚，好像在说：“好吧，孩子，现在轮到你了。” “嗯，我可以向你报告，总的来说，法官们看起来休息得很好，而且对新法院的面貌相当满意。

This morning's session was spirited with all of the Justices asking questions and a couple of them smiling rather broadly at the sight of Justice Scalia tearing into the attorneys arguing their cases." "Okay.

[.my2]
今天上午的会议气氛热烈，所有法官都在提问，其中有几个法官看到斯卡利亚法官撕扯着律师们为案件辩护的样子，脸上露出了灿烂的笑容。” “好吧。

What about the upcoming term? What cases can we look forward to?" "Well, you know, Alexis de Tocqueville once wrote that, in the United States, almost every pressing social question eventually reaches the Supreme Court.

[.my2]
即将到来的学期呢？我们可以期待哪些案件？” “嗯，你知道，亚历克西斯·德·托克维尔曾经写道，在美国，几乎所有紧迫的社会问题最终都会到达最高法院。

And while last term was an unusual blockbuster of a year, this term is no slouch either." "Later this month, the Court will hear what is probably the last broad based challenge to the death penalty.

[.my2]
虽然上一届任期是一年中不同寻常的轰动一时，但这一届也毫不逊色。”“本月晚些时候，法院将听取可能是对死刑的最后一次广泛质疑。

The Court must decide if capital punishment should be invalidated if statistics show that it's imposed disproportionately more often on blacks than on whites, or more often on the killers of whites than on the killers of blacks.

[.my2]
如果统计数据显示，对黑人判处死刑的次数多于对白人的次数，或者对杀害白人的人判处死刑的次数多于对杀害黑人的人，法院必须决定死刑是否应无效。

The decision in this case, will have an enormous impact on the more than 1,700 men and women currently on death row." "Last year, the Court issued major decisions in the affirmative action area.

[.my2]
本案的判决将对目前被关押在死囚牢房的 1,700 多名男女产生巨大影响。” “去年，法院在平权行动领域做出了重大判决。

What about this year?" "Well, last year, the Court ruled than affirmative action is generally acceptable in hiring, but not in lay-offs.

[.my2]
今年呢？” “嗯，去年，法院裁定，在招聘方面平权行动通常可以接受，但在裁员方面则不可以。

This year, the Court will focus its attention on affirmative action in promotions and when that kind of affirmative action, if ever, is permissible.

[.my2]
今年，法院将重点关注晋升中的平权行动，以及何时允许这种平权行动（如果有的话）。

The Court will also hear a major sex discrimination case involving pregnancy.

[.my2]
法院还将审理一起涉及怀孕的重大性别歧视案件。

At issue is a California law that requires all employers to provide women up to four months disability leave for pregnancy.

[.my2]
争议焦点在于加利福尼亚州的一项法律，该法律要求所有雇主为女性提供最多四个月的怀孕伤残假。

A California bank is challenging the law, claiming that it discriminates against men who do not get that kind of disability leave when they are ill.

[.my2]
加州一家银行正在对该法律提出质疑，声称该法律歧视那些生病时无法享受伤残假的男性。

The bank claims that the California law violates a federal law which bans any sort of discrimination based on pregnancy.

[.my2]
该银行声称，加州的法律违反了禁止基于怀孕的任何形式歧视的联邦法律。

Then, there's another case that involves the federal law banning discrimination against the handicapped in employment.

[.my2]
然后，还有一个案件涉及联邦法律禁止就业歧视残疾人。

The question in this case is whether people who have a communicable disease, like AIDS or tuberculosis, can be denied jobs because of their disease.

[.my2]
本案的问题是，患有艾滋病或肺结核等传染病的人是否会因为疾病而被拒绝工作。

In this case, a school system fired a teacher who had tuberculosis." "What about the area of separation of Church and State, cases involving religion?" "There are a whole slew of these cases again this year, but two stand out as particularly interesting.

[.my2]
在这起案件中，学校系统解雇了一名患有肺结核的教师。” “政教分离领域，涉及宗教的案件怎么样？” “今年又出现了大量此类案件，但有两起案件最为突出，特别有趣。

One case pits the evangelical Christian community against the nation's educators.

[.my2]
其中一个案例使福音派基督教团体与国家教育工作者对立起来。

Louisiana passed a law that requires all schools that teach the theory of evolution to teach creationism alongside it as an alternative theory: creationism being the theory that God created man whole without any evolution.

[.my2]
路易斯安那州通过了一项法律，要求所有教授进化论的学校同时教授神创论作为替代理论：神创论是上帝在没有任何进化的情况下创造了整个人类的理论。

When this law was passed in Louisiana, it was challenged in court by the Quasi-independent state school board, which argued that creationism has no scientific basis, only a religious basis.

[.my2]
当这项法律在路易斯安那州通过时，它在法庭上受到准独立州立学校董事会的质疑，该董事会认为神创论没有科学基础，只有宗教基础。

A federal court struck down the law ruling that it, in effect, amounted to an endorsement of religion, and Louisiana's governor appealed to the Supreme Court." "In a second religion case, the Court will decide if religious and political groups have the right to distribute literature inside government run airport terminals.

[.my2]
联邦法院驳回了这项法律裁决，认为它实际上相当于对宗教的认可，路易斯安那州州长向最高法院提出上诉。”“在第二个宗教案件中，法院将决定宗教和政治团体是否有权利在政府运营的机场航站楼内分发宣传品。

Sound familiar? When Los Angeles tried to ban the distribution of such literature, a minister from Jews for Jesus challenged the ban in court.

[.my2]
听起来有点熟？当洛杉矶试图禁止分发此类文学作品时，一位支持耶稣的犹太人牧师在法庭上对这一禁令提出质疑。

The lower courts ruled that airports are public forums much like parks and sidewalks, and that the government could not can the distribution of political or religious literature there.

[.my2]
下级法院裁定，机场是公共场所，就像公园和人行道一样，政府不能在那里分发政治或宗教文献。

Los Angeles appealed to the Supreme Court, and today the High Court agreed to review the case.

[.my2]
洛杉矶向最高法院提出上诉，今天高等法院同意复审此案。

There'll be lots of other fascinating cases this year on questions as diverse as gambling on Indian preservations to presidential versus congressional powers.

[.my2]
今年还会出现许多其他引人入胜的案例，涉及的问题多种多样，从对印第安人保留地的赌博到总统与国会权力的博弈。

Today, as I said, was just the beginning." "Thank you, NPR's legal affairs correspondent, Nina Totenberg." Scientists at the National Cancer Institute said they have found a new method for treating cancers of the lung, liver and colon in test animals.

[.my2]
正如我所说，今天只是一个开始。”“谢谢你，NPR 法律事务记者 Nina Totenberg。”美国国家癌症研究所的科学家表示，他们在测试中发现了一种治疗肺癌、肝癌和结肠癌的新方法动物。

The scientists report the method cured cancer of the liver and colon in mice.

[.my2]
科学家们报告说，这种方法治愈了小鼠的肝癌和结肠癌。

NPR's Lori Garrett has details.
NPR 的 Lori Garrett 提供了详细信息。

Doctor Steven Rosenberg has done it again.

[.my2]
史蒂文·罗森伯格医生又这么做了。

Last year, Rosenberg stunned the medical community with word he had successfully treated some human cancer patients with a revolutionary type of therapy.

[.my2]
去年，罗森伯格用革命性的疗法成功治疗了一些人类癌症患者，震惊了医学界。

But some of the patients suffered serious side effects from the treatment.

[.my2]
但一些患者因治疗出现了严重的副作用。

One died as a result.

[.my2]
结果一人死亡。

So Rosenberg has been busy working on improvements.

[.my2]
因此罗森伯格一直忙于改进。

Today, in Science magazine, Rosenberg reports studies in mice show he may have found the right treatment.

[.my2]
今天，罗森伯格在《科学》杂志上报道说，对老鼠的研究表明他可能已经找到了正确的治疗方法。

Rosenberg is working on ways to trick the body's immune system into successfully attacking tumor cells.

[.my2]
罗森伯格正在研究欺骗人体免疫系统成功攻击肿瘤细胞的方法。

The immune system is complicated.

[.my2]
免疫系统很复杂。

Any successful attack on cancer cells involves a vast army of special immune chemicals and cells.

[.my2]
对癌细胞的任何成功攻击都涉及大量的特殊免疫化学物质和细胞。

A key chemical is Interleukin-2.

[.my2]
一种关键化学物质是白细胞介素-2 (Interleukin-2)。

It stimulates cells of the immune system to do their jobs and kill enemy targets such as cancer cells.

[.my2]
它刺激免疫系统细胞发挥作用并杀死癌细胞等敌人目标。

Interleukin-2 is now readily available, cheaply manufactured because it can be made through genetic engineering techniques.

[.my2]
Interleukin-2 现在很容易获得，且制造成本低廉，因为它可以通过基因工程技术制造。

Rosenberg and his colleagues initially tried to grow human white blood cells in the laboratory in dishes full of Interleukin-2.

[.my2]
Rosenberg 和他的同事最初尝试在实验室里装满 Interleukin-2 的培养皿中培养人类白细胞。

The idea was to stimulate those white blood cells, make them good fighters, and then inject them back into the cancer patients where they would tackle the enemy tumor cells.

[.my2]
这个想法是刺激这些白细胞，使它们成为优秀的战士，然后将它们注射回癌症患者体内，在那里它们可以对抗敌人的肿瘤细胞。

It worked, but the doses of Interleukin-2 that were required were toxic, even deadly.

[.my2]
它确实有效，但所需剂量的白细胞介素 2 是有毒的，甚至是致命的。

Now, Rosenberg is trying something new on mice.

[.my2]
现在，罗森伯格正在老鼠身上尝试一些新的东西。

Instead of withdrawing white blood cells and treating them in the laboratory, Rosenberg removes pieces of the actual tumors.

[.my2]
罗森伯格没有抽取白细胞并在实验室中对其进行治疗，而是切除了实际肿瘤的碎片。

He then grows those tumor cells in the lab in dishes full of Interleukin-2.

[.my2]
然后，他在实验室里装满白细胞介素 2 的培养皿中培养这些肿瘤细胞。

In a few days, the tumor cells die, leaving only a handful of lymphocytes.

[.my2]
几天后，肿瘤细胞死亡，只留下少量淋巴细胞。

These are cells that were attached to the tumors, but were previously unable to kill them.

[.my2]
这些细胞附着在肿瘤上，但之前无法杀死它们。

Now, activated by their incubation with Interleukin-2, these lymphocytes are ready to fight.

[.my2]
现在，这些淋巴细胞通过与 Interleukin-2 一起孵育而被激活，准备好战斗。

Rosenberg injects these specially primed lymphocytes into the mice.

[.my2]
罗森伯格将这些经过特殊处理的淋巴细胞注射到小鼠体内。

He also injects more Interleukin-2, but in small enough doses that no side effects are noticed.

[.my2]
他还注射了更多的 Interleukin-2，但剂量足够小，没有注意到任何副作用。

And he injects one more thing: a chemical that suppresses the rest of the immune system so that nothing will interfere with the work of the primed killer cells.

[.my2]
他还注射了另一种东西：一种抑制免疫系统其余部分的化学物质，这样就不会干扰已启动的杀伤细胞的工作。

The results are nothing short of astonishing.

[.my2]
结果简直令人惊讶。

Now remember this is mice, but for all mice with advanced cancers of the colon, this treatment eliminated 100% of the tumors.

[.my2]
现在请记住，这是小鼠，但对于所有患有晚期结肠癌的小鼠，这种治疗消除了 100% 的肿瘤。

Half of the mice with lung cancer were cured.

[.my2]
一半患有肺癌的老鼠被治愈了。

All of the mice with cancer of the liver were cured.

[.my2]
所有患有肝癌的小鼠都被治愈了。

Now, Rosenberg's laboratory is growing similar killer cells for human beings, and the National Cancer Institute plans to begin human experimental treatment soon.

[.my2]
现在，罗森伯格的实验室正在为人类培养类似的杀伤细胞，国家癌症研究所计划很快开始人体实验治疗。

Although this study appears quite hopeful, it must be remembered that this work so far only involves mice.

[.my2]
尽管这项研究看起来很有希望，但必须记住，迄今为止这项工作仅涉及小鼠。

Whether results will be as dramatic in human beings remains to be seen.

[.my2]
人类的结果是否会如此引人注目还有待观察。
