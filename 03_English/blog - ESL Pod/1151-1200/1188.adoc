This episode is a dialogue between James and Vicky about television ads for children. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
James: Look at that! It’s commercial after commercial. It’s terrible how advertisers are going after kids.
Vicky: They’re just doing their job, marketing to a lucrative demographic.
James: But just look at what our kids are bombarded with: toy commercials and junk food ads!
Vicky: Children’s television is no different from any other type of programming. Commercials are a fact of life.
James: But don’t you think it’s wrong to manipulate young viewers with these commercials? Aren’t they more susceptible to false advertising?
Vicky: Shh! That’s our company’s product commercial. It really gets your attention, doesn’t it?
James: Yeah, it’s grand, just grand.
[end of dialogue]
James begins our dialogue by saying to Vicky, “Look at that! It’s commercial after commercial.” A “commercial” (commercial) is a commercial advertisement. The word “commercial” refers to making money in this case, or businesses. However, we use the word “commercial” nowadays to mean the same as an “advertisement,” which is some sort of announcement on television, radio, or nowadays YouTube that tries to get you to do something or to buy something – usually to buy something.
James is talking about all of the commercials on television. He says, “It’s commercial after commercial,” meaning first there’s one commercial, then there’s another one. He’s complaining about how many commercials there are. He says, “It’s terrible how advertisers are going after kids.” “Advertisers” are the people who pay for the commercials – the ads or advertisements. It could be a company – it usually is – but it could also be an organization.
Advertisers, according to James, are “going after kids.” “To go after” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to try to influence a particular group of people or to try to get your message to a particular group of people. In this case, the group of people are “kids” (kids). “Kids” are children. Vicky says, “They’re just doing their job.” She’s referring to these advertisers. These advertisers are “just doing their job.” In other words, they’re not trying to do anything bad. They’re just doing what they’re supposed to do.
And what exactly is their job? According to Vicky, it’s “marketing to a lucrative demographic.” “Marketing” (marketing) comes from the verb “to market” (market) which means to get people to know about your product or service, usually so that they will buy more of whatever it is you’re selling. “To market” isn’t exactly the same as “to advertise.” “Marketing” refers to anything you do to get people to become aware of or to know about your product or service. “Advertising” is one way that you can market your product or service.
Advertising refers usually to paying a television station or a website to put some sort of announcement – an “ad” – about your product or service. So, advertising is one way of marketing your product to get people aware of your product. Vicky is talking about these companies “marketing to a lucrative demographic.” “Lucrative” (lucrative) means very profitable, something you can make a lot of money from. You might describe playing professional sports, like professional baseball or professional soccer, as being “lucrative.” You can get a lot of money doing that.
A “demographic” (demographic) as a noun refers to a section or group of people who have similar characteristics. It could be a group of women. It could be a group of children. It could be a group of people who are all learning English. Those are all examples of “demographics” – groups within a larger population. Children are a “lucrative demographic” according to Vicky, meaning that companies can make a lot of money from them. Of course, they’re really making the money from their parents.
James says, “But just look at what our kids are bombarded with: toy commercials and junk food ads.” “To bombard” (bombard) can mean to drop bombs – explosive devices – on a certain area, but it’s used more commonly nowadays to refer to the act of sending lots of different messages or images to a certain group of people over and over again – so many that this group can’t pay attention or think about anything else.
You might say, for example, that advertisers “bombard you with emails” to get you to buy things from them, or that you are “bombarded with requests” from people at your company to help them with their projects. Notice we use the proposition “with.” You are “bombarded with” something. Well, in this case we’re talking about children who are “bombarded with ads” – advertisements – advertisements for toys and junk food.
“Toys” are objects designed to entertain and amuse children. “Junk (junk) food” refers to food that doesn’t have a lot of nutritional value, that tastes good but usually isn’t very good for your body – things like McDonald’s hamburgers, for example. Vicky responds, “Children’s television is no different from any other type of programming. Commercials are a fact of life,” she says. “Children’s television” refers, of course, to television programs or shows that are made for children.
“Programming” here refers to the kinds of TV shows or movies that are shown on a particular channel or a particular station on television. “A fact of life” is something that you have to accept, something that is very common and you can’t change. Usually we use this expression “a fact of life” when we are referring to something that isn’t very pleasant, isn’t very nice, but that you can’t avoid. If you live in Los Angeles, traffic – lots of cars on the road – is “a fact of life.” If you want to live here, you just have to understand that and put up with it. You have to tolerate it.
James says, “But don’t you think it’s wrong to manipulate young viewers with these commercials?” “To manipulate” (manipulate) means to change or influence someone, but usually in a negative way by using some sort of secret or hidden approach or tactic. If someone “manipulates” you, that person is trying to get you to do something, say something, or think something by, in a way, tricking you or not telling you that he’s trying to get you to change your mind or to think in a certain way.
We don’t like to be manipulated by other people. We don’t like other people to try to get us to say something or do something by a way that isn’t honest, that isn’t open. James thinks that these advertisers are “manipulating young viewers” (viewers). A “viewer” is a person that views or watches, in this case, television programs. If you are listening to the radio or to a podcast, you are a “listener.” For a television program you would be a “viewer,” even though of course you’re also listening to the television program as well as watching it or “viewing” it.
James asks, “Aren’t they,” meaning children, “more susceptible to false advertising?” “To be susceptible” (susceptible) means to be easily influenced or affected by someone or something – influenced in such a way that something negative will happen, something bad will happen to you. James is worried that children are “susceptible to false advertising.” “False advertising” would be advertising that tells lies, which some people think refers to almost all advertising. But that’s not true, of course.
Vicky says, “Shh!” She’s telling James to be quiet. “That’s our company’s product commercial. It really gets your attention, doesn’t it?” Now we understand, at the end of this dialogue, that Vicky works for a company that has advertisements for children on television. She says, “That’s our company’s product (product) commercial.” The word “product” usually refers to a physical object that you sell. Some companies sell products. Some companies sell services. They don’t give you anything physical, but they do something for you.
James says at the end, “Yeah, it’s grand, just grand.” The word “grand” (grand) usually means wonderful or great. But here, James is being sarcastic. He’s using the word in one way to mean something the opposite. He’s trying to make a joke by saying, “Oh yeah, it’s grand.” But the way he says it indicates that he’s making a joke. He doesn’t like the idea, I guess, that Vicky’s company advertises to children.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Culture Note
The Children’s Advertising Review Unit
The Council of Better Business Bureaus created the Children’s Advertising Review Unit in 1974 to “promote” (encourage) “responsible” (ethical) advertising to children in all types of “media” (newspapers, magazines, television, etc.) It is a “self-regulatory body” (an organization that regulates itself or its own industry, without being legally required to), but it works closely with the “Federal Trade Commission” (the U.S. government agency responsible for regulating communications).
The Children’s Advertising Review Unit “reviews” (monitors and evaluates) advertisements on television, the radio, magazines, the Internet, comic books, and more to determine whether they are appropriate for children under the age of 12. If the Children’s Advertising Review “determines” (decides) that an advertisement is inappropriate, usually because it is “misleading” (causing someone to reach the wrong conclusion) or “inaccurate” (wrong; not correct), it will try to get the advertiser to “voluntarily” (of one’s own free will, without being forced to do something) change the “ad” (advertisement).
The Children’s Advertising Review Unit believes that advertising to children requires following special guidelines because children are young, “immature” (not fully developed like adults), “unsophisticated” (without a lot of knowledge about the world), and inexperienced. Children might not be able to evaluate the “claims” (statements of truth) made or “implied” (indicated without being stated explicitly) in an ad and therefore may be “particularly” (especially; significantly) susceptible to such ads.
The Children’s Advertising Review Unit also tries to influence parents. The Unit creates publications to help parents work with their kids to understand advertising and how it can “influence” (affect) “consumer behavior” (shopping practices and buying decisions).
