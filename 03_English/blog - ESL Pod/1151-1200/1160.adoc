This episode is a dialogue between Tanya and James about making mistakes at work and getting in trouble. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Tania: What time is your meeting with Ted?
James: It’s at 3:00. Why?
Tania: You don’t seem worried. If I were being accused of misconduct and up for disciplinary action, I’d be on edge.
James: It was a minor offense. I’m sure I’ll just get a slap on the wrist.
Tania: I heard about it and it didn’t sound that minor.
James: People blow things out of proportion. It’s not like I’ll be up for dismissal or anything.
Tania: I hope not, but you might get a written reprimand placed in your personnel file. That could affect your chances for a raise or promotion.
James: I don’t have much of a chance of getting either one, quite frankly, so why sweat it? I’ll deal with whatever punishment I get.
Tania: I’m glad that’s your attitude.
James: What I say is: Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time!
[end of dialogue]
Tanya begins by asking James a question: “What time is your meeting with Ted?” James says, “It’s at 3:00. Why?” Tanya says, “You don’t seem worried.” You don’t seem concerned. “If I were being accused of misconduct and up for disciplinary action, I’d be on edge.” Tanya says that if she were “accused of misconduct,” she’d be “on edge.”
“To be accused” (accused) means that someone has said that you have done something wrong or perhaps even something illegal. If someone accuses you of stealing something, that person is saying that you stole something. You did something, in this case, wrong and possibly illegal.
James is being accused of misconduct. “Misconduct” (misconduct) is breaking the rules, doing something wrong. “Misconduct” is a more formal term for doing something wrong or behaving in such a way that your company or organization thinks that you need some sort of punishment. Usually that’s what it means. The word “conduct” simply means behavior. It could be good behavior or bad behavior. “Misconduct” is always bad behavior or poor behavior, or breaking the rules and regulations.
Tanya says that James is “up for disciplinary action.” “To be up for” something means to be considered for something. It could be a good thing or it could be a bad thing. If someone says, “I’m up for a promotion” (promotion), meaning getting a better job in your company, that’s a good thing. “To be up for disciplinary action,” however, is certainly a bad thing. “Disciplinary” (disciplinary) comes from the word “discipline.” “To discipline” someone is to punish someone, to do something bad to someone who has done something wrong.
A parent may discipline his child for doing something wrong by, oh, I don’t know, sending the child to his room or telling the child he has to sit in the corner and not play with the other kids for 10 minutes or five minutes. If your child does something wrong, you may say to the child, “You’re not going to get any dessert tonight, or any sweets tonight. That’s my way of disciplining you.” “Disciplinary,” then, refers to some sort of punishment.
“Disciplinary action” would be something the, in this case, company will do to you for breaking the rules. Tanya says that James is “up for disciplinary action.” If she were in that condition or that situation, she would be “on edge.” “To be on edge” (edge) means to be worried about something, to be nervous about something. You could also be on edge if you were perhaps uneasy. You’re not sure what’s going to happen. “I’m waiting to get the results of my exam. I’m on edge.” I’m uneasy.
James, however, doesn’t seem to be worried. He says, “It was a minor (minor) offense (offense).” Something that is “minor” is not important, not significant – “small,” we might say. The opposite of “minor” is “major” (major). Of course, “minor” and “major” are also musical terms. But here they refer to the importance or significance of something. An “offense” is a violation, when someone breaks a rule or breaks a law. James says that whatever he did was a “minor offense.”
He says, “I’m sure I’ll just get a slap on the wrist.” A “slap (slap) on the wrist (wrist)” is a very mild, almost insignificant punishment. It’s when you don’t get disciplined very much. It’s when the punishment you get doesn’t seem very significant or very serious. If you kill someone, if you murder someone, and then the police tell you, “Well, you’re only going to have to pay a $10 fine for that,” that would be a slap on the wrist. That’s not normally going to happen in most places.
Your “wrist” (wrist) is part of your body. It’s where your hand meets the rest of your arm. A “slap” (slap) is a hit. “To slap” usually means to take your hand and hit someone on his or her face, but “slap” could also mean a very light or not very painful hit with your hand. A “slap on the wrist,” then, would not be a very painful experience, and therefore not a very significant punishment. I’m not saying that you should slap anyone hard in order to discipline them. It’s an old expression that means a very, what we might describe as, “mild” or even “minor” punishment.
Tanya says, “I heard about it,” meaning I heard about what you did, James. “And it didn’t sound that minor.” Noticed the use of the word “that” here to mean “very.” It didn’t sound very minor, meaning it didn’t seem to her that whatever James did was a minor offense. James continues, however: “People blow things out of proportion.” The expression “to blow (blow) things out of proportion (proportion)” means to treat a situation or to consider a situation as if it were much more important and serious than it actually is.
If you come home and your wife asks you if you brought the groceries home – the food – home from the store and you say, “Oh no, I forgot.” If then your wife takes out a gun and shoots you, that would probably be blowing things out of proportion. Your wife is getting more angry then she really should. So, “Honey, I’m sorry I forgot the groceries today – don’t shoot me.” That’s blowing things out of proportion.
James says that his situation has been blown out of proportion, apparently. He says, “It’s not like I’d be up for dismissal or anything.” James is saying that he’s not going to be dismissed. “To be up for dismissal” (dismissal) means that you are going to be fired. You are going to lose your job. That’s the meaning of the verb, in this case, “to dismiss.” Tanya says, “I hope not, but you might get a written reprimand placed in your personnel file.” A “reprimand” (reprimand) is a written notification that you did something wrong. Usually a reprimand says something about what will happen if you do that same thing again.
So, a “written reprimand” would be something that a company would put in your “personnel file.” “Personnel” (personnel) – notice there are two “n”s in “personnel” – refers to people who work for an organization. Your “personnel file” (file) would be information about you that, at least in some companies, is still kept in a physical thing, called a “file” or a “folder,” in which you put pieces of paper that are related to each other. Nowadays, of course, the word “file” usually refers to an electronic file, a document.
Tanya reminds James that this written reprimand that would be put or placed in his personnel file could affect his chances “for a raise or promotion.” A “raise” (raise) is when you get more money for the work you do at your company. A “promotion,” as we mentioned previously, is when you get a better job at your company.
James says, “I don’t have much of a chance of getting either one, quite frankly.” The expression “quite (quite) frankly (frankly)” means I’m telling you this in a very honest way; I’m telling you in a very direct way. When someone uses the phrase “quite frankly,” he’s saying, “I’m being honest with you.” I’m being 100 percent honest with you even though it might be embarrassing or even though it might perhaps anger you. In this case, though, James is saying that quite honestly, “quite frankly,” he doesn’t think he’s going to get a raise or a promotion, “so why sweat it?”
“To sweat (sweat) it” means to be very nervous or worried about something. If someone says, “Don’t sweat it,” he’s saying don’t worry about it. It’s no big deal. James says, “I’ll deal with whatever punishment I get.” A “punishment” is, of course, something done to you when you do something wrong. It’s a negative consequence of your actions, we might say. Tanya says, “I’m glad that’s your attitude,” meaning I’m glad that that is your viewpoint – the way you think about things.
James ends the dialogue by saying, “What I say is,” meaning my opinion is, “Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time.” That’s an old expression: “Don’t do,” or commit, “the crime” – that is, don’t break the law – “if you can’t do the time.” “To do the time” here means to take the punishment, usually to be placed in a jail, to be put in a prison. If someone says he’s “doing time,” that person means he’s in prison. Or if a person said, “Yeah, I did time back in the 1980s,” she’s telling you she was in prison back in the 1980s.
“Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time. Don’t do it.” That was a song. Actually, it was from a television show called Beretta. “Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time” was part of the theme song, the song that they would play at the beginning of the show. I believe it was written by the great Sammy Davis Jr. Interestingly, the actor who played the character Beretta in the TV show himself was accused of murder. He, however, was not found guilty, though many people said that he did do the crime. He just didn’t do the time. Who knows?
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

What Else Does It Mean?
on edge
The phrase “on edge,” in this podcast, means nervous, uneasy and worried about what might happen: “Blake is really on edge, because he’s trying to figure out how to break up with his girlfriend.” The phrase “to take the edge off (something)” means to make a bad or painful situation a little better, or to make a situation less stressful or worrisome: “Drink this, and rub this cream into the wound. That should take the edge off the pain.” The phrase “to be on the edge of (one’s) seat” means to be very excited about something and entirely focused on what will happen: “That movie was so suspenseful! We were on the edge our seat the whole time we were watching it.”
quite frankly
In this podcast, the phrase “quite frankly” means in an honest, direct, blunt, and straightforward manner, without hiding anything: “Quite frankly, I think this is a horrible idea and I won’t participate in it.” The phrase, “Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn” is a well-known line from the 1939 film Gone with the Wind, meaning that one doesn’t care at all: “Please don’t tell me anymore about what you bought while shopping. Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn.” In general, the word “quite” is used to add emphasis: “It’s quite exciting to fly in an airplane for the first time.” Or, “The thought of speaking in public is quite terrifying.” Finally, the phrase “not quite” means not entirely, or not completely: “The book wasn’t quite what I expected after seeing the movie.” Or, “When I asked Sara if she had finished the paper yet, she said, ‘Not quite.’’
Culture Note
Workplace Misconduct
People like to say, “The punishment should fit the crime,” meaning that minor offenses should be punished in minor ways, and “major” (big; important) offenses should be punished in major ways. Most large businesses categorize their employees’ workplace misconducts in terms of minor and major offenses.
Typical minor offenses include “tardiness” (arriving late), taking “excessive” (too many or too much of something) breaks (short periods of time when one is not working), taking longer lunch breaks than “permitted” (allowed), and poor “timekeeping” (reporting how many hours one has worked). Other minor offenses involve interactions with customers and/or other employees, such as “rude” (not polite) or “aggressive” (threatening) words or behavior. “Still other” (additional) minor offenses involve “violations” (not following of rules) of policies, such as violations of safety procedures, misuse of equipment, or refusal to “obey” (follow the instructions) of managers or supervisors. In most cases, these minor offenses result in an “oral” (spoken) warning and/or a written reprimand.
Major offenses, also known as instances of “gross misconduct” usually result in harm to people or property and often are violations of the law. For example, “assaulting” (physically attacking) another employee or making someone feel unsafe would be considered a major offense. Stealing property from the company, or committing “fraud” (lying and stealing) would also be major offenses. Likewise, coming to work in an “inebriated state” (under the influence of drugs or alcohol) is unacceptable. Businesses may have their own policies for dealing with such major offenses, or they might “bring in” (involve) “law enforcement authorities” (police and related agencies).
