This episode is a dialogue between Nadia and Andre about legal problems. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Nadia: I’m not sure about this civil lawsuit. I don’t want a long trial.
Andre: Relax. This case will never go to trial. For disputes of this kind, neither party wants to fight it out in court, so we almost always reach a settlement.
Nadia: If we do go to court, the legal fees could skyrocket. I couldn’t afford that.
Andre: If we reach a settlement, you won’t have to worry too much about that.
Nadia: All right, but what if they don’t want to admit wrongdoing?
Andre: If we reach a settlement, they don’t need to. They’ll simply pay out.
Nadia: Even if they don’t admit it, at least I’ll be able to talk freely about it.
Andre: Well, that might be a problem. Many settlements require confidentiality – from both parties.
Nadia: You mean if I settle, I can’t talk about it?
Andre: If there is a confidentiality clause, you’d be in breach of contract if you discussed the settlement.
Nadia: I didn’t know that. You mean I can’t talk about what they did to me without getting my day in court?
Andre: That’s the long and short of it.
Nadia: I guess justice is blind – but only for the rich!

Nadia begins by saying, “I’m not sure about this civil lawsuit.” There are two kinds of issues that involve the court system, the legal system, in the United States. One is “criminal” – that’s when you break a law, such as one against stealing or a law against killing someone. That would be a “criminal offense.” A “civil” (civil) issue is one where you do something wrong to someone else and the other person tries to get, usually, money from you.
For example, I’m driving down the street and I accidentally hit your car. You could try to get money from me. This would be what we would call a “civil action,” when you go to the government – to the court system, to the legal system – and try to get the government to force me to give you money. We would call this a “civil lawsuit” (lawsuit). A “lawsuit” is when I file a complaint, if you will, a legal case against you with the government to try to get you to pay me money for something you did wrong.
There are many different kinds of civil lawsuits in the U.S. Most of them involve getting money from another person or another organization who did something wrong to you. Nadia says, “I’m not sure about this civil lawsuit. I don’t want a long trial.” A “trial” (trial) refers to the time when you go in front of a judge in a court in order to decide if you are going to win your lawsuit or not. Andre says, “Relax. This case will never go to trial,” meaning you will never have to go in front of a judge. “For disputes of this kind, neither party wants to fight it out in court, so we almost always reach a settlement.”
A “dispute” (dispute) is a disagreement or an argument. The word “party” (party) here doesn’t refer to a celebration like a birthday party, but rather to a person or an organization who is involved in a legal action – in this case, a “civil lawsuit.” Andre says, “Neither party wants to fight it out in court.” “To fight it out” means to continue arguing. “In court” means in a court room, in a trial with a judge and lawyers and sometimes a “jury” (jury) – a group of people who decide who wins the case.
Andre says, “We almost always reach a settlement” (settlement). A “settlement” is an agreement where you decide to give money to the other person. Usually this happens without going in front of a judge. So I say, “I’m going to file a lawsuit against you.” I’m going to go to the court and ask the court to make you give me money. And you say, “Well, that’s not necessary. Let’s just agree that I will give you some money right now.” That agreement is called a “settlement.”
Nadia says, “If we do go to court,” meaning if we do go in front of a judge, “the legal fees could skyrocket.” “Legal fees” (fees) refers to money that you have to pay the lawyers and perhaps the court for having this lawsuit. The verb “to skyrocket” (skyrocket) means to increase very quickly, to increase dramatically. “The price of the house skyrocketed in the last year.” That means the price of the house went up very quickly in the past 12 months.
Nadia says that she’s afraid the legal fees could skyrocket. “I couldn’t afford that,” she says, meaning “I would not have enough money for that.” Andre says, “If we reach a settlement, you won’t have to worry too much about that.” Nadia says, “All right, but what if they don’t want to admit wrongdoing?” “To admit” (admit) means to say that you did something wrong. “Wrongdoing” (wrongdoing) – one word – refers to something that you did wrong, that you did something wrong.
Andre says, “If we reach a settlement, they don’t need to,” meaning if we reach an agreement, they don’t have to say, “Yes, we made a mistake.” He continues, “They’ll simply pay out.” “To pay (pay) out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to give someone a large amount of money, a lot of money, usually as part of some sort of settlement, some sort of agreement.
Nadia says, “Even if they don’t admit it, at least I’ll be able to talk freely about it.” “To talk freely” (freely) means to be able to tell anyone you want about something. In this case, it would mean to talk about perhaps what the other person did wrong to you. Andre says, “Well, that might be a problem. Many settlements require confidentiality – from both parties.” “Confidentiality” (confidentiality) refers to not talking about something with anyone else. It refers to information that you cannot give to anyone else.
Many times when you work for a company, you have to agree not to tell anyone outside of your company about what the company is doing. That’s “confidentiality.” You have to not tell anyone the company secrets. Sometimes legal settlements require that you be quiet about that. You don’t tell anyone about what the other person or company did to you that caused them to pay you money. So the agreement basically says, “You can’t tell anyone about what we did.” That’s part of the agreement in which you will get money. I’ll give you money, but you can’t tell anyone about it.
That’s a “confidentiality agreement” – a promise not to talk about something. This often requires that both parties to the agreement keep quiet about what happened. “Parties” again means the people involved or the organizations involved in the settlement. Nadia says, “You mean if I settle, I can’t talk about it?” Notice the use of the verb there, “to settle.” “To settle” means to sign a settlement agreement.
Andre says, “If there is a confidentiality clause, you’d be in breach of contract if you discussed the settlement.” A “clause” (clause) refers to a section or a part of a legal agreement. If the settlement has a “confidentiality clause,” a section that requires you not to talk about it, then if you did talk about it, you would be “in breach (breach) of contract.” A “contract” is an agreement. The verb “to breach” means to break or violate.
A “breach of contract” is when someone violates the contract, when someone doesn’t do what the contract or agreement says he’s supposed to do. So, if there’s a “confidentiality clause” in the settlement and you talk about it, you are going to be “in breach of contract.” You, therefore, have broken the agreement, and usually when you break an agreement, when you don’t follow an agreement, there are penalties that you have to pay. There are things that you have to do as punishment.
Nadia says, “I didn’t know that. You mean I can’t talk about what they did to me without getting my day in court?” “To get your day in court” means to actually go in front of a judge and talk about what happened as part of a civil lawsuit. If you sign an agreement with someone, there is no court appearance. There is no day in court. You don’t go in front of a judge.
So what Nadia is asking is if it’s true that if she signs this agreement, she won’t get to tell anyone about what this company or this organization did to her – that is, she won’t get her day in court to explain to the whole world what happened. Andre says, “That’s the long and short of it.” The expression “the long and short” of something means that is correct. That is an accurate statement. We usually use this expression when we’re trying to give someone a short answer, or a summary of a longer story or a more complicated piece of information.
Someone may ask you, “Well, what happened yesterday?” “Well,” you could say, “this person said this, and the other person said that, but the long and short of it is, we’re all going to lose our jobs.” “The long and short” of something is a brief statement of whatever that information is. You might say, “Well, why don’t you just say ‘the short of it?’” I don’t know, but that’s not the expression. We say “the long and short of it,” even though it’s really just the short version of some longer piece of information.
Nadia says, “I guess justice is blind – but only for the rich!” The expression “justice (justice) is blind (blind)” is used to show that the law is fair, that the law doesn’t care about who you are. Nadia says that she thinks “justice is blind,” meaning our legal system is fair, “only for the rich” – only for people who have a lot of money.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Nadia: I’m not sure about this civil lawsuit. I don’t want a long trial.
Andre: Relax. This case will never go to trial. For disputes of this kind, neither party wants to fight it out in court, so we almost always reach a settlement.
Nadia: If we do go to court, the legal fees could skyrocket. I couldn’t afford that.
Andre: If we reach a settlement, you won’t have to worry too much about that.
Nadia: All right, but what if they don’t want to admit wrongdoing?
Andre: If we reach a settlement, they don’t need to. They’ll simply pay out.

Culture Note
Binding Arbitration
“Binding arbitration” is a way for two parties to end a dispute without involving the courts. In binding arbitration, the parties “refer” (send for consultation) their dispute to a “third party” (another person who is not involved in the dispute) for arbitration, and that person’s decision is “binding” (something that people must agree to, and that cannot be changed).
The Federal Arbitration Act, “enacted” (made into law) in 1925, “governs” (has control over) arbitration for “interstate” (between states or countries) “commerce” (business; buying and selling). The parties must agree that the arbitration” (there is no way to undo the arbitrator’s decision), and they must agree to the arbitration “in lieu of” (instead of) going to the courts. The “Supreme Court” (the most powerful court in the United States) has made it clear that the arbitrator’s decision is “final” and cannot be “appealed” (sent to another person or court for review and a new judgment).
The arbitrators are usually a single individual or a “tribunal” (a small group) of three people. The arbitrators might be selected and “appointed” (named to a particular position) by the parties involved in the dispute, but the arbitrator should be a “neutral” (without favoring one side or the other) third party, without any “conflict of interest” (a financial or emotional motivation to behave in a particular way or make a particular decision).
Many businesspeople like arbitration, because they can appoint a technical expert if the dispute involves a lot of technical details. Arbitration is also usually faster, more “discreet” (private; without information being shared with many people), and more convenient than taking the dispute to court. Arbitration fees are often significantly less than the legal fees associated with “retaining” (hiring for service) attorneys.
