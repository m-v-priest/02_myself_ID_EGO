This episode is a dialogue between Tom and Marianne about people who don't like what the government is doing and try to change it. Let's get started.
[start of dialog]
Tom: Have you seen the news?
Marianne: No, what’s happening?
Tom: People in McQuillanland are rising up against the dictator and rallying against his government.
Marianne: Wow, this is big. I thought the dictator would order a media blackout and we wouldn’t hear any news out of McQuillanland.
Tom: There is a media blackout, but people are using social media to tell the world what’s going on. Hundreds of thousands of protesters are clashing with police, and the government is having no success putting down the protests.
Marianne: Has it been violent?
Tom: It’s early days yet, but the government has already used tear gas and fired into the crowd. It’s hard to say how many people have been hurt.
Marianne: So this may be the end of tyranny in McQuillanland.
Tom: Don’t bet on it. The dictator has ruled with an iron fist and won’t hesitate to use any means necessary to stay in power.
Marianne:" Well, the protesters have a fighting chance and I’m betting that they’ll topple the government and that ruthless tyrant!
[end of dialog]
Our dialogue begins with Tom saying to Marianne, “Have you seen the news?” Marianne says, “No. What's happening?” Tom says, “People in McQuillanland are rising up against the dictator and rallying against his government.” “To rise up against someone” means to fight against someone, usually the government, or the people who are in charge. “To rise up against the government” means to try to get rid of the government, the people running the government, to fight against them, to start a revolution.
Tom says, “The people in McQuillanland,” which is normally a nice place, “are rising up against the dictator.” A “dictator” (dictator) is a political leader who has complete power, who doesn't listen to other people, who doesn't let people have a voice in his or her government, someone who controls everything and usually, someone who is not very nice to people who don't like him. If I started to give the names of some dictators, I would have to be here for a couple of days, perhaps, before I finish. So, we'll just describe what a dictator is and you can think of your own examples.
Tom says “The people in McQuillanland are rising up against the dictator and rallying against his government.” “To rally” (rally) means, in this case, to get together in the same place, to gather, to assemble, especially if you are doing it for some sort of political reason, usually associated with protesting some action of the government. “To protest” means to oppose, to be against, to say, “We don't want that anymore.” Marianne says, “Wow. This is big,” meaning this is important or this involves a lot of people. “I thought the dictator would order” – would demand – “a media blackout.” “Media” (media) refers to television, newspaper, radio – nowadays, the Internet, Twitter – all of these are part of media. A “media blackout” is when the government decides to close the newspapers, to close the televisions, to shut down or turn off the Internet connections, to stop people from getting information about what's going on in their own country.
Marianne says that she thought the dictator would order this media blackout. Tom says, “There is a media blackout, but people are using social media to tell the world what's going on.” I included Twitter in my description of “media,” but more specifically, Twitter is part of what we would call “social media.” This is the new forms of technology like Twitter or Facebook that allow people to share information with their friends and people they know on the Internet very quickly.
Tom says, “Hundreds of thousands of protesters are clashing with police and the government is having no success putting down the protests.” Tom talks about hundreds of thousands of “protesters.” A “protester” is a person who protests, a person who tries to fight against some wrong that he sees the government doing or that society is engaged in. “To clash” (clash) means to fight against someone, to oppose someone, often with physical force, with violence. “Protesters are clashing with police,” Tom says, “and the government is having no success putting down the protests.”
“They’re having no success,” that is, there are not able to put down the protests. “To put down” here is a phrasal verb meaning to stop, especially when a government stops people who are opposed to it from protesting, from speaking. If the government put down the protesters, they would be silencing them.
Unfortunately, at least for the dictator, the government has not been successful in putting down the protests, in stopping them. Marianne says, “Has it been violent?” Has there been a lot of physical force that has hurt or perhaps even killed people? Tom says, “It’s too soon to know that yet.” He uses the expression “it's early days yet.” “It's early days yet” means it's too soon to know. It's perhaps more common in British English than it is in American English, this expression, “it's early days yet.”
Tom says “The government has already used tear gas and fired into the crowd.” “Tear (tear) gas” is a special kind of gas that is meant to hurt your eyes and make it difficult for you to continue any physical activity. It's what police would use with a large group of people, a large crowd of people that they were trying to get rid of, that they were trying to get to go home. “To fire into the crowd” means to use a gun and shoot into a group of people. This obviously can be rather dangerous.
Tom says, “It's hard to say how many people have been hurt.” Marianne says, “So this may be the end of tyranny in McQuillanland.” “Tyranny” (tyranny) is a cruel, unfair, mean government, where you have a dictator or someone who is in the government or a group of people in the government who are hurting the people, who are not letting the people be free. Tom says, “Don't bet on it.” Don't bet on this being the end of tyranny in McQuillanland. “To not bet on something” means don't count on it, don't depend on it.
Tom says, “The dictator has ruled with an iron fist and won't hesitate to use any means necessary to stay in power.” “To rule with an iron (iron) fist (fist)” means to control or govern a population very strictly, to not let anyone do anything that you don't want them to do, especially those who don't like you, those who oppose you. A dictator often rules with an iron fist. The fist is just your hand that is, we use the verb “clenched” – it is put together like a ball. That's your fist. A “iron fist” would be a fist that of course, would be very hard and well, it would hurt you if you got punched by an iron fist. But the expression is “to rule,” to govern, “with an iron fist.”
Tom says, the dictator won't hesitate, will be very willing, to use any means necessary to stay in power. The expression “to use any means (means) necessary” means to do whatever needs to be done. If you have to kill someone, you kill someone. If you have to hurt someone, you hurt them. You will use any means necessary. The dictator will use any means necessary to “stay in power,” meaning to keep his power, to keep his control of the government.
Marianne says, “Well, the protesters have a fighting chance and I'm betting that they'll topple the government and that ruthless tyrant.” “To have a fighting chance” means that they have a possibility of winning. It's not impossible for them to win. Marianne is betting that the protesters will “topple” the government. “To topple” (topple) means to overthrow, to put an end to a government, or the rulers of that government. “Ruthless” (ruthless) describes someone who is willing to do anything. It's connected with the expression, “to use any means necessary.” Someone who is ruthless will do whatever it takes to get what he or she wants. The dialogue talks about a ruthless “tyrant” (tyrant). “Tyrant” is related to the word “tyranny,” and here really just means a dictator.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a normal speed.

Culture Note
Kent State Shootings
The Kent State Shootings, sometimes called the Kent State “Massacre” (an incident where many people are killed), happened at Kent State University in Kent, Ohio, on May 4, 1970. Students across the country were protesting against the Vietnam War and specifically President Nixon’s plans to “invade” (go into a country without permission) Cambodia.
At Kent State University, the protests began peacefully, but the crowd became angry and ended up yelling, breaking windows of some local businesses, and throwing beer bottles. The police and then the “National Guard” (an organized group of citizens who are trained and ready to fight or otherwise serve their country when needed) became involved over a four-day period as the protests “escalated” (became bigger and more serious).
On May 4, university “officials” (employees with authority) tried to cancel the students’ planned protest, but about 2,000 people gathered anyway. The National Guard tried to “disperse” (make people spread out) the protestors, but they were unsuccessful and the protestors began throwing rocks. The National Guard threw tear gas at the students and then began firing at the students. In 13 seconds, 67 “rounds” (bullets) were shot, killing four students and “wounding” (causing injuries to) nine others. The shootings “raised many questions” (made people begin to ask) about whether the government has the right to disperse protestors and/or shoot citizens.
Photographs of the shootings “shocked” (surprised in a negative way) people across the United States and “prompted” (caused; led to) many other protests. The shootings have been “memorialized” (put into something else to be remembered) in songs, poems, books, plays, and other forms.
