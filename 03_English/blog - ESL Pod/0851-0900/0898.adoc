[start of dialog]
Gloria: I’m surprised at the variety of people on this tour.
Andy: Oh, yeah? I hadn’t noticed.
Gloria: Well, we’ll be spending the next two weeks with these people so I thought I’d get to know some of them.
Andy: That’s nice.
Gloria: Did you see that thirty-something couple with a toddler and an infant? I’m really surprised they’re on this tour.
Andy: I’m sure they know what they’re doing.
Gloria: And how about that group of seniors? Some of them look like they’re in the mid- to late-seventies.
Andy: They seem pretty spry to me.
Gloria: But what really surprises me is that group of middle-aged couples with their tween and teenage children. They’ll be a handful.
Andy: They seemed pretty well behaved to me.
Gloria: And did you notice that woman in her early-forties and the forty-ish man each traveling alone? She seemed nice, but he didn’t seem too friendly.
Andy: Maybe he’s using his time to size up everybody like you are.
Gloria: Well, I wish there were more young adults in this group. I like talking to young people.
Andy: I think there will be plenty of people for you to talk to these two weeks when you’re not sightseeing.
Gloria: Sightseeing? Oh yeah, sightseeing.

Gloria says, “I'm surprised at the variety of people on this tour.” “Variety” just means many different kinds of people. Andy says, “Oh yeah? I hadn't noticed.” I didn't realize. Gloria said, “Well, we’ll be spending the next two weeks with these people so I thought I'd get to know some of them.” Gloria and Andy are on some sort of tour, probably of a different city or a different state, maybe even a different country. They're getting to know the people who are in the same tour group. Gloria says she is getting to know them and Andy says, “That's nice.” Andy doesn't seem very interested, does he?
Gloria says, “Did you see that thirty-something couple with a toddler and an infant? I'm really surprised they’re on this tour.” “Thirty-something” spelled (thirty-something) is an expression meaning someone who's in their thirties. They could be 30, 31, 32, 33 all the way up to 39. That would be a thirty-something. If you are in your 20’s, you would be a twenty-something. If you are in your fifties, you would be a fifty-something and so forth. When you don't know someone's exact age, but you think they're in their twenties or thirties or forties, you can use this expression. “Toddler” (toddler) describes a young child, usually one, two, maybe three years old, who has recently learned to walk. A toddler is a young child but one who can walk. An “infant” (infant) is the same as a baby. This is someone who is not able to walk. “Infants” have to be carried from one place to another or maybe they can crawl on their hands and knees to move themselves back and forth.
Gloria says she’s surprised to see the thirty-something couple with a toddler and an infant on the tour. Andy says, “I'm sure they know what they're doing,” meaning the parents know what they're doing so we shouldn't worry about it. I think Andy is also kind of saying to Gloria here, if I may interpret the script for you, that perhaps Gloria is too interested in these other people. Gloria might be someone who we would describe as “nosy” (nosy). Someone who's nosy is always trying to find out what's going on in other people's lives, trying to find things that are really not their concern, things that are, we would say, none of their business.
Gloria says, “And how about that group of seniors?” “Seniors” (seniors) describes an old person, especially someone who is retired, who is no longer working. Gloria says, “Some of them look like they're in their mid to late seventies.” When we use the prefix mid (mid) followed by a hyphen, in front of words like sixties, seventies or twenties, thirties, forties – any age, we mean they’re in the middle of that range. To say someone's in their mid-seventies means they're probably 74, 75, or 76. If you're in your mid-thirties, you're probably 34, 35, 36. You can also describe ages using the prefix “late.” He's in his late eighties. That means he's probably 87, 88, or 89, and of course, you could also say early. He's in his early forties. He's 40, 41, 42, maybe 43.
Andy says that these seniors that Gloria is talking about, “seem” or appear, “pretty” or very, “spry” to him. “To be spry” (spry) means to have a lot of energy. It’s often used to describe an older person who has perhaps a surprising amount of energy who’s more energetic than you may expect him to be. Gloria says, “But what really surprises me” – she continues to make observations – “is that group of middle-aged couples with their tween and teenage children. They'll be a handful.” “Middle-aged (middle-aged) means you are in the middle of your lifespan. Usually, we think of the ages between, say, 45 and 65 maybe 70 nowadays, as being middle-aged or between 50 and 70. I have to say that because I'm not yet 50 so I don't want to consider myself middle-aged, but I probably am.
Anyway, middle-aged would be people who are older but not retired – people who are probably still working in their 40’s, 50’s and 60’s. Gloria says that she's surprised that there is a group of middle-aged couples, meaning usually husband and wife, with their tween and teenage children. “Teenage,” you probably know, is someone who is between the ages of 13 and 19 years old. We call that person a teenager. The “teen” comes from the numbers thirteen, fourteen, fifteen and so forth. A “tween” (tween) is a newer word. It describes someone usually in the age bracket of nine to 12. Someone who isn't quite yet a teenager but they're not a child anymore, either. They’re not a young child. They're still children, of course. Nine to 12 is sometimes described now, in the last maybe 20 years or so as a tween.
I think one of the reasons that word was invented was for advertising and marketing reasons. They wanted a term that would cover children who perhaps had enough influence on their parents to make them buy things so they decided to target them. They decided to advertise directly to them. That's, in any case, what a tween is – someone between the ages of nine and twelve. It could describe a boy or a girl but it's more often used to describe girls.
Gloria says that that these children will be a handful. When we say someone or something is a “handful,” we mean it's a lot of work. It's going to be difficult. It's going to be challenging. Once again Andy does not agree with Gloria. That's how you know they're married. He says that the children seem pretty well behaved to me. “Well-behaved” means that they are not acting inappropriately. They're not yelling. They’re not screaming. They’re quiet; they’re respectful – that would be well-behaved. We use that expression when talking about children or perhaps students.
Andy doesn't agree with Gloria but Gloria continues to go on and make her observations. She says, “And did you notice that woman in her early forties and the forty-ish man, each traveling alone?” “Early forties,” we've already described. “Forty-ish” with the suffix (ish) at the end means approximately. This is an informal suffix that we put on words to indicate that we’re not exactly sure. We’re saying it's kind of like that. You may ask, for example, “Is it cold outside?” You could say, “Well it's cold–ish,” meaning it's sort of cold but it's not really cold or, “How hungry are you? Are you very hungry?” You can say, “Well I'm hungry-ish.” I'm not exactly starving, I'm not really hungry but I'm a little hungry. This is very common now in conversational English - but informal English, to be sure - by adding “ish,” you are saying that you're not quite sure about something or you’re giving an approximate age in this case, when we say forty-ish.
Gloria says that “The woman seemed nice but the man didn't seem too friendly.” She’s describing these two people who are traveling by themselves. Andy says, “Maybe he's using his time to size up everybody like you are. The verb “to size (size) up” is a phrasal verb, meaning to evaluate or assess something, usually just by looking at them. You size up a situation or you size up a person. There's also an idea here that you're doing it rather quickly and that you're doing it by comparing them to, perhaps, other people. So a boss might size up the people who are applying for a job, decide, “Well, I like that person, and that person is better than that person but not as good as this person.” That would be to size up. It could also mean to look at someone and decide what you think they’re like. You think that's a friendly person. You think that's a mean person just by looking at them. That, of course, is not a very good idea.
Gloria says, “Well, I wish there were more young adults in this group.” A “young adult” is a very general term to describe someone who's 18 years or older but usually younger than say, 30. Young adults tend to be 18, 19 – all the way up to 30, maybe even 35. I am no longer a young adult. Gloria says, “I like talking to young people.” Andy says, “I think there will be plenty of people for you to talk to these two weeks when you're not sightseeing.” “Sightseeing” is what you do on a tour. You go and you visit famous places – museums and parks and that sort of thing. Gloria says, “Sightseeing? Oh yeah, sightseeing.” She's forgotten that, of course, the main reason you go on a tour is not to meet the other people in the tour but to see the places that you are going to visit.
Now let’s listen to the dialog, this time at a normal speed.

Gloria: I’m surprised at the variety of people on this tour.
Andy: Oh, yeah? I hadn’t noticed.

What Else Does It Mean?
-late
The suffix “-late,” in this podcast, means toward the end of a range, especially when talking about dates or ages: “Yolanda bought her first car in the late-80s.” A “late bloomer” is a person who develops more slowly than others, especially physically: “James was a late bloomer and didn’t begin dating until he graduated college.” The phrase “late-breaking” describes a news story that is changing rapidly and has information that became available immediately before a newspaper was printed or immediately before a story was recorded: “We interrupt the regularly scheduled programming to bring you this late-breaking news.” Finally, the phrase “late-night” describes something that happens late at night: “We’re going to see the late-night showing of the new movie.”
to size up
In this podcast, the phrase “to size up” means to assess and evaluate someone or something, especially just by looking at the person or thing and especially when comparing or rating against others: “We went to watch the team play, just so we could size up their players before our match against them.” Something that is “pint-sized” is very small, especially for children: “Oh, look, this dollhouse comes with a pint-sized piano.” Or, “Look at those pint-sized six-year-old soccer players coming on to the field.” Finally, something that is “bite-sized” can be placed in one’s mouth without cutting or biting it: “Please cut the carrots and peppers into bite-sized pieces.”
Culture Note
Ageism and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act
“Ageism” or “age discrimination” is the act of treating people unfairly because of their age, especially because one believes they are too old to do something well. Children and teenagers “face” (confront; must deal with) ageism when their “ideas are not taken seriously” (others do not respect their ideas). Seniors face ageism when they have trouble finding a job because employers prefer to “hire” (offer a job to) younger people.
In 1967, the United States “enacted” (made into law) the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which “prohibits” (does not allow) age discrimination against anyone who is at least 40 years old. Specifically, employers cannot state age preferences or restrictions in “help-wanted ads” (advertisements announcing a job opening). Employers also cannot use age as a “factor” (something that helps to determine something else) in hiring, “compensation” (how much is one is paid), or “termination” (firing) decisions. Since 1986, the law has also restricted “mandatory retirement” (the practice of forcing people to retire when they reach a certain age).
However, exceptions are made if age can be shown to be a “bona fide” (made in good faith, without intent to mislead or trick someone) “occupational qualification” (something needed to be able to perform a job well). For example, age would be a bona fide occupational qualification when hiring an actor to “portray” (show; act as) a young character. In most other cases, however, age itself is not the restricting factor, but rather it is mental “acuity” (sharpness of thought) or physical “agility” (gracefulness; ability to move quickly).
