This episode is a dialogue between Hugo and Melissa. They’re going to talk about the way that people work – the style, the manner that different people work, describing those different work styles that you might find at a job or in life generally. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Hugo: How do you like working with Leo? Is it working out?
Melissa: No, it’s not. Our work styles completely clash and we butt heads at every turn.
Hugo: Really? I thought you were partnered up because you complemented each other’s strengths.
Melissa: Yeah, but that doesn’t mean we can work well together. I’m collaborative and like to talk things out. Leo likes to go solo. He goes off on his own and comes back with a finished product, without consulting with me at all.
Hugo: Yeah, I’ve worked with Leo before and he likes having autonomy, but he has to realize that the point of collaboration is that the sum is greater than the parts. Two people pooling ideas will make the product better.
Melissa: That’s the idea, anyway. Hey, I have a better idea. What do you think of you and me teaming up? We’re both collaborative. We’d make a great team.
Hugo: Yeah, but we also have the same skills. That’s why you’re working with Leo and I’m working with Lamar, remember?
Melissa: Yeah, I remember. I’m starting to think that collaboration is overrated.
[end of dialogue]
Hugo begins by saying, “How do you like working with Leo?” He’s asking Melissa, “Is it working out?” “To work out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning, in this case, to be successful, to be effective, to be the way that you hope or expect something to be. “I hope this relationship works out with my girlfriend; I really like her.” Or, “I hope my new job works out,” I hope things go well. “To work out” can also mean to exercise at a gym, for example.
Melissa says, “No, it’s not (it is not working out). Our work styles completely clash and we butt heads at every turn.” Oh dear, sadness here in our story. Melissa says that her work style and Leo’s work style completely clash. “Work style” is the way that you work. Some people like to work with other people, some people like to work alone, some people like to do everything early, some people like to do everything at the very end, and so forth. When we say something “clashes” (clash), in this case it means the two things don’t go well together, they don’t match; they’re very different, so it is a very bad combination of elements or of things. “Clash” can have several other meanings, and you can find those in the Learning Guide.
Melissa says that she and Leo butt heads at every turn. The phrase “to butt (butt) heads at every turn” means that you are always fighting, you’re often disagreeing about things, you’re constantly having arguments. Hugo says, “Really? I thought you were partnered up because you complemented each other’s strengths.” “To partner up” is a phrasal verb meaning to put people in groups of two for some purpose. We might also say, “to pair up.” A teacher in a classroom might partner up the students to work on an activity: “Johnny, you work with Julie; and Bobby, you work with Billy,” and so forth. Melissa and Leo in our story were partnered up because they complemented each other’s strengths. “To complement” (complement) means to be a good match or combination for someone or something. If you like to draw and I like to write, and we have to make a children’s book, our talents – our abilities complement each other. They complete each other, you might think of it as. “Compliment” can also be spelled with an “i” in the middle (compliment). That “compliment” is when you say something nice to someone: “You have beautiful red shoes on today my dear, my beautiful wife.” I always compliment my wife on her shoes and her hair, and that’s what a good husband does. And if you want to be a good husband, and you don’t compliment your wife, well, you just need to go back and study the book on how to become a good husband. Unfortunately, they no longer make that book I think!
Anyway, our story talks about Melissa and Leo complementing each other’s strengths. Your “strengths” are things that you do well. Melissa says, “Yeah, but that doesn’t mean we can work well together. I’m collaborative and like to talk things out.” “To be collaborative” means to do things as part of a team, to work well with other people. “To talk things out” means to talk about your ideas with another person so that you can get better ideas, or perhaps you can become clearer in your thinking. Someone who likes to talk things out likes to have long conversations about something because they think that will help them do a better job, and that’s what Melissa likes to do. Leo is completely different; “Leo likes to go solo.” “To go solo” means to work by yourself. “Solo” is one, or by yourself. Melissa says that Leo goes off on his own (meaning he goes somewhere else and works by himself) and comes back with a finished product (a completed project), without consulting with me at all. “To consult (someone)” means to ask someone’s opinion before you do something or before you make a decision. Leo doesn’t consult with Melissa, he just does his project without asking her opinion.
Hugo says, “Yeah, I’ve worked with Leo before and he likes having autonomy.” “Autonomy” (autonomy) means independence, the ability to do things without having to ask other people for their opinion or for their permission. This word is often used in politics. In certain countries there are groups that want autonomy, or different parts of the country that want autonomy; they don’t want to be controlled by the national government. Here in the United States, each of our 50 states has a certain autonomy, things it can do by itself. Hugo says that Leo has to realize that the point (or the purpose) of collaboration (of working with each other) is that the sum is greater than the parts. This phrase, “the sum (sum) is greater than the parts,” while in some ways a logical impossibility, is used to mean that people who work together are often able to accomplish more than those people working by themselves. It can also be used, this phrase, to mean that a situation is very complicated and can’t be described by individual elements or factors, or that when you put all those things together you get something greater than what you would expect by just looking at the individual elements or parts. So Hugo says that the point of collaboration is that the sum is greater than the parts. “Two people pooling ideas will make the product better.” “To pool” (pool), used here as a verb, means to share or combine, to use two or more things together at the same time. There are other meanings of the word “pool.” You can find out what they are by looking at the Learning Guide for this episode.
Melissa says, “That’s the idea, anyway. Hey, I have a better idea. What do you think of you and me teaming up?” “To team up” is a phrasal verb meaning the same as to pair up, to partner up, to work with someone else as a team. Melissa says, “We’re both collaborative. We’d make a great team.” Now, I’m not sure if Melissa actually wants to work with Hugo because he’s a good worker. Perhaps Melissa is interested in Hugo, and doesn’t like Leo. You never know. In an office, there are always these romantic attractions or connections.
Melissa wants to work with Hugo. Hugo says, “Yeah, but we also have the same skills (we know how to do the same things; they don’t complement each other). That’s why you’re working with Leo and I’m working with Lamar, remember?” Lamar is, I guess, another worker – a male worker. Melissa says, “Yeah, I remember. I’m starting to think that collaboration is overrated.” When we say something is “overrated” (one word), we mean that we think of it more highly than it deserves to be, or we value it more highly than it deserves to be, than the actual or real value of something. When people say someone or something is “overrated,” they’re saying that people say it’s good, they say it’s great, but it’s not as good as people say. So for example: “That movie I saw last week was overrated. Everyone said it was great, eh, it wasn’t that great.” Or, “This restaurant is overrated. The food is good, but it’s not great.”
Now let’s listen to the dialogue at a normal speed.

Culture Note
Collaboration Between Thomas Edison and J.P. Morgan and the Vanderbilts
Many people know that Thomas Edison “invented” (created something for the first time) the first “practical” (able to be used in real life) “light bulb” (the round, glass ball that produces light when screwed into the base of a lamp). But that is only part of the story. Edison had a lot of creative ideas, but he didn’t have enough money to “realize” (make something happen) them on his own.
Edison needed “financial backing” (money that makes something possible), so he had to collaborate with “wealthy” (rich) people or businesses. Many “investors” (people who give their money to a project because they believe it will be successful and will make them money) gave Edison “funding” (money to be used for a particular purpose) in the 1870s and 1880s. These investors included J.P. Morgan and the Vanderbilts.
J.P. Morgan was a wealthy banker and an art collector. The Vanderbilts made their money in the “railroads” (companies related to transportation by train) and “shipping” (sending goods across large distances). Their funding led to the creation of the Edison Electric Light Company, which later “merged” (joined another company) with the Thomson-Houston Electric Company to create General Electric, which is still “in operation” (in business) today.
Edison’s funders supported him in other ways, too. For example, J.P. Morgan’s home in New York City became the first “private residence” (a home owned by an individual or family, not a business or government building) to have electric lighting in New York.
Edison’s success would not have been possible without collaborating with J.P. Morgan, the Vanderbilts, and other investors.
