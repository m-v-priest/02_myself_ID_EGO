This episode is called “Introducing a New Product.” It’s a dialogue between Augie and Lillian. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Augie: Today’s the day. I’m giving you the heads up. Our company is rolling out its new line of cell phones.
Lillian: I can see you’re excited about it. What’s so special about the new products?
Augie: This line of phones has state-of-the-art technology and never-before-seen features. It’s been in development for over a year and it’s been really hard keeping it under wraps.
Lillian: I thought information was leaked weeks ago.
Augie: Those were just rumors, and the company put a clamp on those pretty quickly.
Lillian: Wasn’t the new line supposed to come out next month?
Augie: That was the original plan, but since McQ Corp. is coming out with its own line of phones soon, we wanted to get a jump on them.
Lillian: And steal their thunder.
Augie: Yes, and steal their thunder. We had to scramble to get the phones ready ahead of schedule, but I think it was worth it. They’re really going to make a splash.
Lillian: I hope so. I hope all of this hype has been justified.
Augie: Oh, it will be. I’ll know soon enough.
Lillian: How?
Augie: You’ll be begging me to get you one.
[end of dialogue]
Our dialogue begins with Augie saying, “Today’s the day. I’m giving you the heads up. Our company is rolling out its new line of cell phones.” To give (someone) the heads up” means to let someone know something is going to happen in the future, to give someone information before other people may have it; you’re letting them know early about something. “My friend in the accounting department gave me a heads up about how the company was doing this year.” He gave me some information before other people got it. In this case, Augie is giving Lillian the heads up about the fact that their company is rolling out its new line of cell phones. “To roll (roll) out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning when a company introduces and begins selling a new product or service. We use this verb, “to roll out,” meaning to launch, to begin a new product, start selling something different. “Line” here, as in “new line of cell phones,” just means a new group or a new set of cell phones. “Roll” has several meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.
Lillian says, “I can see you’re excited about it. What’s so special about the new products?” Augie says, “This line of phones has state-of-the-art technology and never-before-seen features.” “State-of-the-art,” with hyphens in between each word, means very modern, very advanced, the newest and the best technology – state-of-the-art technology. We use state-of-the-art typically to talk about machines or computers, something mechanical. “Never-before-seen,” also with hyphens in between the words – never-before-seen – means that no one has ever seen or experienced something like this; it’s completely new, it never existed before in the past.
Augie thinks their cell phones have never-before-seen features. He says, “It’s been in development for over a year (for more than a year) and it’s been really hard keeping it under wraps.” When something is “in development” we mean that it is being worked on by a company but it isn’t finished yet. We use this expression a lot here in Los Angeles in talking about movies and films, and when I say “we,” I mean people who work in films and movies – not me. When they say “in development,” they’re referring to something that is not yet produced, often not even yet filmed, but something that they are working on. In fact, there’s even an expression “a development deal” (deal), or a development agreement. When one of the big media companies decides to do something about a particular series or idea, they make an agreement with a person and they develop the idea – they work on it.
Augie says that it’s been really hard to keep this new cell phone under wraps. “To keep (something) under wraps” (wraps) means to keep something secret, not to share information about it to other people. Lillian says, “I thought information was leaked weeks ago.” The verb “to leak” (leak) in this case means to share secret information with the newspaper or with the general public or on the Internet about your company or about your organization. Typically, it’s secret information that you are not supposed to tell anyone else. There are leaks all the time of information from the government. Somebody tells the media – tells the newspapers about some secret, that’s called a leak.
Augie says, “Those were just rumors.” A “rumor” is something that is unofficial, and may or may not be true but many people are talking about it. There are rumors that Brad Pitt is considering making a movie about my life. Actually, I’m starting that rumor. If you could tell other people, then we would have a rumor; people would be talking about it. It’s not necessarily true, however. I’ll let you guess whether it is true or not! Augie says, “the company put a clamp on those pretty quickly.” “To put a clamp (clamp) on (something)” means to stop something from happening or to stop it from continuing to happen, typically by doing something drastic – that is, with a lot of force, power, or strength. Well, the company put a clamp on those rumors pretty, or very, quickly.
Lillian says, “Wasn’t the new line supposed to come out next month?” The phrasal verb “to come out,” in this case only, means to be released, to be introduced to something, to be made available to the public. So a company that has a new thing it is selling will say the new phone, for example, is coming out in July, meaning that’s when you can buy it – in July.
Augie says, “That was the original plan, but since McQ Corp. is coming out with its own line of phones soon, we wanted to get a jump on them.” “To get a jump on (someone)” means to do something before someone else does it before you, to do something faster or sooner than another person, often when you are competing with that other person. You may decide to get a jump on your schooling by taking classes in the summer, when everyone else will start in the fall. You’re doing it before everyone else. Lillian says, “And steal their thunder.” So, Augie is saying that their company is releasing their phone now, before the McQ Corp. releases their new phone. The reason, Lillian says, is to steal their thunder. “Thunder” is normally the sound that is made when there is a big storm and there is what is called lightning, which are very powerful electrical charges that appear sometimes in a big storm. In this case, however, “to steal (someone’s) thunder” means to take attention away from someone else, or to get the praise of other people before the other person can. It’s normally something you don’t want to do, unless you don’t want to be nice to someone. In this case, the company wants to make sure that its new product gets publicity before McQ Corp.’s new phone.
Augie says, “Yes, and steal their thunder. We had to scramble to get the phones ready ahead of schedule, but I think it was worth it.” “To scramble” here means to do something very quickly, to do it faster than you would normally do it. “Scramble,” however, has a couple of different meanings in English, and those are in the Learning Guide. They were scrambling to get the phones ready “ahead of schedule,” meaning before the deadline, before the day that it was supposed to be done. If your schedule says you’re finishing the product or the project next Tuesday, and you decide you want to finish it on this Friday, you are finishing it ahead of schedule, before the original plan.
Augie says the new phones are really going to make a splash (splash). “To make a splash” means to do something that attracts a lot of attention, that many people look at or notice. Lillian says, “I hope so. I hope all of this hype has been justified.” “Hype” (hype) is things that are said about a product that make people more interested in wanting to buy it, often before it is even available. You could talk about the hype over a new movie: people are talking about it; people are saying how good it is. Hype is always a positive thing – at least positive things being said about this new thing that is not yet available. However, it’s also sometimes used to mean that people are exaggerating – are saying things that are better about it than it really is.
Lillian says she hopes the hype has been justified, meaning something that you can support, something for which there’s evidence, something that shows that it really is what it says it is. Augie says, “Oh, it will be. I’ll know soon enough,” meaning very quickly, soon. Lillian says, “How?” Augie says, “You’ll be begging me to get one.” “To beg” (beg) means to plead, to ask someone to do something in a very urgent way. “Please help me.” You’re begging for help.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
[start of dialogue]
Augie: Today’s the day. I’m giving you the heads up. Our company is rolling out its new line of cell phones.
Lillian: I can see you’re excited about it. What’s so special about the new products?
Augie: This line of phones has state-of-the-art technology and never-before-seen features. It’s been in development for over a year and it’s been really hard keeping it under wraps.

What Else Does It Mean?
to roll out

to scramble
In this podcast, the verb “to scramble” means to do something very quickly, or to use all of one’s available resources to get something done sooner than one would normally be able to: “Ira scrambled to clean the house before his wife came home from work.” When cooking, the verb “to scramble” means to cook eggs by stirring them constantly in a hot pan: “Do you add milk or water when you scramble eggs?” The verb “to scramble” also means to move quickly over an uneven surface: “The hikers scrambled over the rocky terrain.” Finally, the informal phrase “to scramble (someone’s) brains” means to make it difficult for someone to think clearly: “That young woman has scrambled your brains! Ever since you started dating her, you’ve been unable to concentrate on your work.”
Culture Note
Companies often want to “test” (see how well something works) their new products before they “release” (make available) them to the “general public” (all people; ordinary people). That way, they can identify and correct problems less expensively and with little or no impact on their “brand image” (the opinions that people have about a company or product). This is especially true for technology companies.
Many technology companies offer “beta versions” of their products. A beta version is software that isn’t completely finished or tested, but people agree to use it anyway, reporting any “bugs” (errors in a computer program) to the manufacturer so that they can be fixed. Eventually the beta version is “modified” (changed) and improved until it can be sold to the general public.
Other companies offer their products by invitation so that they can “limit” (put restrictions on) who has access to it. Gmail is a good example of this. When Google “launched” (started; introduced) its email program, it was done by invitation. Only people who received invitations could open a Gmail account. In this way, Google could “monitor” (observe) how a small number of people were using Gmail and make changes as needed before there were too many accounts.
Finally, some companies offer their software as “freeware” (software programs that can be used without paying a fee). Companies allow people to use and try their software, and at the same time, the company continues making improvements. When the company feels it has enough people interested in the software and/or has a version that it believes people will buy, the company may then make the final version available for sale.
