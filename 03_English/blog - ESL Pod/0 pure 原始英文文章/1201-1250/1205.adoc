This episode is a dialogue about being successful romantically with women – something I know nothing about. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Jonah: I’d love to get a date with Jessica. She’s so hot!
Becca: You mean you want to add another notch to your bedpost.
Jonah: I’ve been around the block, but there’s nothing wrong with sowing a few wild oats. That’s all part of being young and carefree.
Becca: Hmm, maybe you shouldn’t be telling me about your conquests.
Jonah: Why not? It’s no secret that I’ve got game. Chicks dig me. Last week alone I . . .
Becca: Really, I think I’ll take a pass on the play-by-play.
Jonah: See that woman over there? Watch me put the moves on her.
Becca: No, thanks. I’m leaving.
Jonah: Wait! Are you going to put in a good word for me with Jessica?
Becca: You know that she’s a good friend of mine, right?
Jonah: Of course I do. That’s why I’m asking you.
Becca: And you thought I’d set her up with a player?
Jonah: I thought she might like a man with experience.
Becca: Forget it.
Jonah: In that case, what are you doing Saturday?

Our dialogue begins with Jonah saying to Becca, “I’d love to get a date with Jessica.” A “date” is a romantic appointment – going to a movie or having dinner with someone you are romantically interested in. Jonah thinks that Jessica is “hot,” meaning she’s attractive in a sexual way.
Becca says, “You mean you want to add another notch to your bedpost? “To add a notch” (notch) to something is to make a mark, usually in a piece of wood. The idea usually is that you are making the notch to mark or to count the number of times you’ve done something. If you are making a notch in your “bedpost,” which is part of your bed, you are symbolically, if not actually, trying to count the number of romantic partners you’ve had.
Becca says that Jonah isn’t really interested in Jessica as a person, but rather as a sexual object. Jonah says, “I’ve been around the block.” The expression – to say you’ve “been around the block” (block) – means you’ve had a lot of experience doing something.
Jonah says, “There’s nothing wrong with sowing a few wild oats” (oats). This expression “to sow (sow) wild oats” is actually a very old one, going back at least 500 years. It refers nowadays, in general, to a young man wasting his life doing things that aren’t very productive like drinking, and more specifically, having sexual experiences with different women. Depending on the context, it could be used to describe a young man who is wasting his life drinking and partying and, more specifically, on sexual adventures.
Jonah says, “That’s all part of being young and carefree.” “To be carefree” (carefree) means not to have any worries or concerns – to be free of cares, without any concerns. If you believe that “sowing a few wild oats” means that you will be carefree, you may be among the 50 percent of Americans who will at some point have a sexually transmitted disease in your lifetime. So, congratulations. A “sexually transmitted disease” is a disease you get from having sex with someone else who has that disease. But Jonah believes he will be carefree.
Becca says, “Hmm, maybe you shouldn’t be telling me about your conquests” (conquests). A “conquest” is a victory or success. In this case it refers to having sexual relations. Jonah says, “Why not? It’s no secret I’ve got game.” The expression “I’ve got game” is used to show that a person is very good at something. It is sometimes used especially among men who think that they are very attractive to other women and are able to have many romantic relationships with women, or to have those easily because women are attracted to them.
In fact, that’s what Jonah says in the next sentence. He says, “Chicks dig me.” The word “chick” (chick) is an informal word for a female, especially a young female. It is considered somewhat of a sexist term. You probably do not want to use it in your own conversation. It’s also somewhat of an older term that isn’t as common now as it was maybe 30 years ago – similarly with the expression “to dig” someone. “To dig” (dig) someone means that you are attracted romantically to that person.
Jonah seems to think that women are attracted to him. That’s why he says, “Chicks dig me.” “Last week alone, I . . .” He begins to tell Becca something but Becca interrupts him. She says, “Really, I think I’ll take a pass on the play-by-play.” “To take a pass (pass) on” something is to choose not to do something or not to receive something. Someone may offer you, I don’t know, a piece of pie, and you are trying to lose weight. So you say, “I think I’ll take a pass on the piece of pie, but thank you.” You are declining to have it. You are choosing not to have it.
Becca wants to “take a pass on the play-by-play.” “Play-by-play” is a detailed description of what happens – or in this case, of what happened. “Play-by-play” is a phrase that comes from the world of sports, when you are watching or listening to a sporting event. The person who is announcing the game, who is talking about the game, will usually tell you exactly what is happening. This is especially true if you are listening on the radio. In order to understand what is happening in the game, the person who is announcing the game gives you the “play-by-play” – exactly what is happening at every moment in the game.
Jonah says, “See that woman over there? Watch me put the moves on her.” “To put the moves (moves) on” a person means to flirt with that person, to try to get that person interested in you romantically. Becca says, “No, thanks. I’m leaving.” Jonah says, “Wait! are you going to put in a good word for me with Jessica?”
“To put in a good word” for someone is to recommend someone to someone else or to say something good about someone. This is often used when someone is, say, applying for a job, or wanting to get a promotion, or simply wants another person to like him. You may ask your friend “to put in a good word for you” with a woman that he knows so that that woman will be interested in you. It probably won’t work, but you can try.
Becca says, “You know that she’s a good friend of mine, right?” Becca is reminding Jonah that Jessica is one of her friends. Jonah says, “Of course I do. That’s why I’m asking you.” Becca says, “And you thought I’d set her up with a player?” “To set someone up” here means to arrange for someone to have a romantic date with another person.
When I first moved to Southern California, I had a student in one of my classes that I was teaching who I later became friends with, and she had a woman that she knew who was single, who was looking to date – who was looking to find a romantic partner. And so she set me up with her friend. She got the two of us together and we went out and had dinner and went dancing, I think. It wasn’t really a good match. She didn’t like me that much. I didn’t like her that much. So, things kind of ended. But my friend was nice enough to “set me up on a date,” we might say, with this other woman. I think that’s the only time I’ve ever been set up on a date. Those kinds of arrangements are often very successful. My mother and father met by being set up on a date by their friends.
Becca doesn’t want to set up her friend Jessica on a date with Jonah because Jonah is a “player” (player). A “player” in this context is a man who dates a lot of women, mostly because he wants to have sexual relations with them, not because he’s interested in them for any long-term romantic relationship such as getting married. Jonah says, “I thought she might like a man with experience.” Becca says, however, “Forget it,” meaning she’s not going to help him.
Jonah then says, “In that case, what are you doing Saturday?” Now Jonah is asking Becca for a date, and we don’t hear Becca’s response. We just hear the sound of the door slamming. “To slam” (slam) here refers to a door that is being closed very loudly. The idea, of course, is that Becca is saying no to Jonah by leaving. When a woman slams the door on you, you know she’s probably not very happy – at least that’s my experience, anyway.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Becca: You mean you want to add another notch to your bedpost.
Jonah: I’ve been around the block, but there’s nothing wrong with sowing a few wild oats. That’s all part of being young and carefree.

Becca: You know that she’s a good friend of mine, right?
Jonah: Of course I do. That’s why I’m asking you.
Becca: And you thought I’d set her up with a player?
Jonah: I thought she might like a man with experience.
Becca: Forget it.

Culture Note
Classic Dating & Relationship Shows
The Dating Game was a popular “dating show” (a television program that shows people dating each other) in which a “bachelorette” (a woman who is single) would sit on the “stage” (a raised area in front of an audience, used for performance in theaters) and “pose” (ask) questions to three “bachelors” (men who are not married). She would not be able to see the three bachelors, but the “viewing audience” (people who were watching the show) could see all four people. At the end of the show, she would choose one of the men for a date, and then be allowed to see him. Sometimes the “gender roles” (who is a man and who is a woman) would be reversed, with a bachelor posing questions to three bachelorettes.
The show “aired” (was shown on TV) beginning in 1965. There were some “gaps” (times when the show was not aired), but the last episode aired in 1999. Many of the “contestants” (people who participate in a game show) became famous after their appearance on the show. These include Farrah Fawcett, Suzanne Somers, Tom Selleck, and Steve Martin.
Another relationship game show, The Newlywed Game, aired between 1966 and 2013. The show has “newlyweds” (people who have been married for a short period of time) compete against other newlyweds by answering questions that “reveal” (show) how much the couples know about their partner. The winner is the couple that answers the most questions correctly. In some episodes, the couples get into “heated arguments” (very strong disagreements) over the answers to the questions, and sometimes this has led to “divorce” (the official end of a marriage)!
