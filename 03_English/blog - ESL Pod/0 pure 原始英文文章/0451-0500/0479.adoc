This episode is called “Using Frequent Flyer Miles.” These are special bonuses or awards that airlines give you for flying on their airplanes. It’s a dialogue between Anne and Jurgen using some vocabulary we use to talk about this special program. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Anne: Where were you this past weekend? I tried calling you on Friday to see if you wanted to go to the movies with me.
Jurgen: I was in Chicago for a long weekend.
Anne: Chicago? I didn’t know you were planning a trip. I thought you were pretty strapped this month. A ticket to Chicago would set you back at least $300.
Jurgen: I am pretty strapped, but I wanted to go to my friend Rachel’s wedding. I was able to use my frequent flyer miles to get a ticket. I was lucky that those weren’t blackout dates.
Anne: Oh, that explains it. You’ve been traveling a lot using your frequent flyer miles. How do you rack up so many miles? I’m enrolled in the frequent flyer programs of three different airlines, but I never seem to have enough miles to redeem them for a ticket or even an upgrade.
Jurgen: The trick is to get a credit card that gives you miles. For every dollar I charge on my credit card, I get one mile. Since I use my credit card for a lot of business purchases, the miles add up pretty quickly. I also use a lot of the hotels and restaurants that partner with the airlines, and doing that gives me bonus miles.
Anne: Aren’t there a lot of restrictions? Do you ever have problems redeeming the miles?
Jurgen: Yeah, there are some restrictions, but I work around them. There are fewer restrictions if you have elite status, but I’m a long way from that.
Anne: So I need to get a credit card that gives me frequent flyer miles.
Jurgen: Yeah, but a word to the wise: spend carefully. You don’t want to rack up credit card debt for the sake of racking up frequent flyer miles!
Anne: Point taken. Thanks for the tip.
[end of dialogue]
Anne begins our dialogue by asking, “Where were you this past weekend? I tried calling you on Friday to see if you wanted to go to the movies with me.” Jurgen explains, “I was in Chicago for a long weekend.” A “long weekend” is usually a period of three days, maybe four days: Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday or Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Americans like to have their holidays on a Monday; that gives them a long weekend. They get Saturday, Sunday, and Monday to rest from work.
So Jurgen was in Chicago, that’s why he couldn’t go with Anne to the movies last weekend. Anne says, “Chicago? I didn’t know you were planning a trip. I thought you were pretty strapped this month.” “To be strapped” (strapped) means to not have any money, to have very little money, we might also say “to be broke.” “Strap” has several meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.
Anne says, “A ticket to Chicago would set you back at least $300.” “To set (someone) back” means that it cost a certain amount of money, it’s the amount of money you have to pay. It’s sort of an odd expression, for example: “This computers set me back $1,000.” That means the computer cost $1,000. We usually use this expression when we are trying to indicate that it’s a lot of money: “I once bought a girlfriend a diamond necklace, it set me back $500.” After I gave her the necklace, of course, she broke up with me and kept the necklace; the lesson here is be careful before giving your girlfriend expensive jewelry!
Anne says that a ticket to Chicago would set you back at least $300. Jurgen says, “I am pretty strapped, but I wanted to go to my friend Rachel’s wedding. I was able to use my frequent flyer miles to get a ticket.” “Frequent” means often; “flyer” is somebody who flies in an airplane. In this case, a “frequent flyer” is someone who uses airplanes a lot – who travels a lot. Many airline companies – many airlines have special programs were you can earn what they call “miles,” points for each trip that you take, and the more trips you take the more miles you get. Eventually, if you get 20,000 or 30,000 miles you can get a free trip.
So, Jurgen is saying that he had flown a lot before; he had these frequent flyer miles, sort of like a coupon, that he could use to get a ticket for free to Chicago. Jurgen says, “I was lucky that those weren’t blackout dates.” In most airline programs they give you these miles that you can “redeem,” or use to get a ticket, however there are certain days that they will not allow you to use your frequent flyer miles. Usually these are around holidays when everyone wants to fly, it’s very popular so you can’t use your miles on very popular days. “Blackout” is when you are not allowed to do something or see something; “blackout dates” are dates that you can’t use your frequent flyer mile coupons. A “blackout” can also mean when there is no power, for example the electricity goes out in your house, and it goes out in the entire city. That would be called a “blackout.” “Blackout” can also mean if you’ve drunk too much and you don’t remember what happened yesterday while you were drinking. This doesn’t happen to me – frequently!
Anne says, “Oh, that explains it (that explains why you were able to go to Chicago).” She says, “You’ve been traveling a lot using your frequent flyer miles. How do you rack up so many miles?” “To rack up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to get a lot of something, usually by adding a little bit at a time over a long period of time. For example, if you have a library book that you don’t return on time, and you do this for several months, you borrow the book and then you don’t return it, the library charges you a “fine,” a fee, a penalty you have to pay, you could say, “I’ve racked up $1,000 in library fines.” Another word would be “accumulated.”
So, Anne is asking Jurgen how he racked up – how he accumulated so many miles. She says, “I’m enrolled in the frequent flyer programs of three different airlines.” “To be enrolled” means that you are participating in something, you sign up or register for something and you are part of that program. We often use this verb in talking about going to college: “I’m enrolled at the university (I am a student and I am going to classes at the university).” Anne says that she never seems to have enough miles to redeem them for a ticket or even an upgrade. “To redeem” means to give something in exchange for something else, usually points or coupons, something that is worth money that you can give in order to get something back. In this case, you are redeeming your frequent flyer miles to get a ticket on that airline. An “upgrade” is an increase or an improvement from one thing or one level to another thing or another level. With frequent flyer mile programs you can sometimes buy a ticket for a certain seat, and then upgrade to a higher class – a better seat: a business class or a first class seat. Airplanes have what they call “economy seats,” these are the cheap seats, they’re also called “coach (coach) seats,” and then they have the bigger, nicer, roomier seats that are business class and first class. So an upgrade would be going from, for example, a coach class ticket to a first class ticket.
Jurgen says, “The trick (or the special way to do this) is to get a credit card that gives you miles. For every dollar I charge on my credit card, I get one mile. Since I use my credit card for a lot of business purchases, the miles add up pretty quickly.” “To add up” means to increase; it’s similar to “to rack up.” “To add up” means things get bigger and bigger, usually slowly over time. So what Jurgen is saying here is that many airlines have agreements or partnerships with credit card companies, when you use your credit card you get one mile, usually, for every dollar that you spend. And since Jurgen uses his credit card for business expenses, he has a lot of expenses on his credit card – a lot of charges, and he gets miles for all of those. This is a very popular program. I do this with my credit card; I get miles for every time I buy something on my credit card. Of course you still have to pay for it, it’s not free.
Jurgen says, “I also use a lot of hotels and restaurants that partner with the airlines, and doing that gives me bonus miles.” “To partner (as a verb) with someone” means to cooperate, to work closely with someone. Again, there are restaurants that partner, or work with the airline companies, and they will give you miles for every dollar that you spend at their restaurant. “To get bonus miles” means to get extra, or additional, miles. “Bonus” has a couple of different meanings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.
Anne asks Jurgen, “Aren’t there a lot of restrictions?” “Restrictions” are limitations, things that you are not allowed to do. She says, “Do you ever have problems redeeming the miles?” Jurgen says, “Yeah, there are some restrictions, but I work around them.” “To work around (something)” means to find a way to do what you want, even though you have restrictions or limitations. It means to be successful even though there are obstacles or things that make it difficult for you to do what you want to do. Jurgen says, “There are fewer restrictions if you have elite status.” “Elite status” is a very high level in a program where you get a lot of additional benefits – a lot of additional things. The frequent flyer programs have different levels of membership. If you fly a lot, for example 100,000 miles a year, you will often be put into a higher category in the program, and you will get more from the program.
Anne says, “So I need to get a credit card that gives me frequent flyer miles.” Jurgen says, “Yeah, but a word to the wise.” The expression “a word to the wise” means that you are going to give the person some advice: “Here is some advice.” He says, “a word to the wise: spend carefully. You don’t want to rack up credit card debt for the sake of racking up frequent flyer miles!” Once again, that verb “to rack up” – to accumulate, to get a lot of. He’s saying you don’t want to get a lot of credit card debt, money you owe to the bank, just so that you can get more frequent flyer miles. “For the sake of” means “in order to.”
Finally, Anne says, “Point taken.” “Point taken” is an expression that we use to mean I understand what you are saying, I agree with what you are telling me. “Point taken,” she says, “Thanks for the tip.”
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

What Else Does It Mean?
to be strapped
The phrase “to be strapped,” in this podcast, means to not have enough money: “They’re strapped this month because they bought a lot of new clothes.” The phrase “to be strapped for cash” has the same meaning: “Clarke was strapped for cash, so he paid for the meal with his credit card.” The phrase “to be strapped in” means to be wearing one’s seatbelt, or to be tied onto or into something: “Please don’t start driving until everyone is strapped in.” The phrase “to strap (something) down” means to tie something to the top of something else, especially to the top of a car: “They strapped their suitcases down and then started driving down the street.” Finally, the phrase “to strap (something) on” means to tie something to one’s body: “The hikers strapped their heavy backpacks on and started walking through the forest.”
bonus
In this podcast, the word “bonus” means extra, additional, or something that is not normally included: “Anyone who buys these dishes this week gets these knives as a free bonus.” A “bonus” is also money that one receives in addition to one’s normal pay for work: “All the employees got a 3% bonus at the end of the year.” Or, “Do you think we’ll get the holiday bonus this year?” The word can also be used as an adjective: “Students can receive 10 bonus points by completing extra homework assignments.” An “added bonus” is something that one did not expect to receive: “Heather had a great time at the party and, as an added bonus, met some new clients, too.”
Culture Note
Most people enroll in frequent flyer programs because they want to “earn” (get) miles and redeem them for reduced-price or free tickets, or get free upgrades to “first class” (more comfortable, larger seats with better service). However, a customer must have a lot of miles “built up” (accumulated; collected) before he or she can get these “benefits” (the advantages or good things about being in a program). Fortunately, other benefits are available to people with fewer frequent flyer miles.
Many airlines let people redeem their frequent flyer miles for “access” (permission to use or do something) to their airport “lounges” (rooms where people can relax). Airport lounges are often quieter than the areas in front of airport “gates” (the areas where people wait for their planes) and they have more comfortable seats. Many airport lounges also have free coffee or “snacks” (food eaten between meals). The nicest airport lounges might even have showers.
People can also redeem their frequent flyer miles for other products and services. For example, you might be able to redeem your miles for magazine “subscriptions,” where you receive the new edition of a certain magazine in the mail each month. Or you might be able to redeem your miles for a piece of electronics, like a stereo or an mp3 player.
Some people don’t fly very often, but they still want to participate in frequent flyer programs. These people can earn miles by staying at “affiliated” hotels (hotels that have an agreement with the airline) or by renting cars from affiliated companies. Some people even buy frequent flyer miles, although this is an expensive way to get the benefits.
