This episode is about someone who talk too much, and someone who doesn’t talk enough. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Marcia: Phew! I thought they’d never leave.
Artem: I enjoyed their company, didn’t you?
Marcia: Jessie is fine, a little reserved and soft-spoken, and on the shy side. Kelly, on the other hand, talked our ear off. No one could get a word in edgewise with her.
Artem: I thought Kelly’s anecdotes were funny. She was a little long-winded, I’ll admit, but I enjoyed talking to her more than trying to make conversation with Jessie. She is so closemouthed and guarded that it was like pulling teeth.
Marcia: I’d rather talk to someone who is a little reticent than a loudmouth.
Artem: Ooh, that’s a little harsh.
Marcia: Maybe you’re right, but I don’t like the blathering, gossipy type.
Artem: I wonder . . .
Marcia: What?
Artem: I wonder what they’re saying about us.
[end of dialogue]
Marcia begins by saying, “Phew! I thought they’d never leave,” meaning they stayed a very long time. Marcia is referring to two guests that they had over, two women from work, I think. Artem says, “I enjoyed their company, didn’t you?” “Company” (company) here means something different than you may expect. “Company” means the time that you spend with other people. That’s what it means here – the presence of another person.
If someone says, “I’m very bad company,” he means I’m not a good person to be with; I’m not a good person to spend time with. It’s a very different meaning than the one you may be thinking of normally, which would refer to a business. But here, “company” means the presence of another person. Marcia says, “Jessie is fine, a little reserved and soft-spoken, and on the shy side.” So, there were two women who were visiting them. One of them is Jessie.
Marcia thinks Jessie is “fine,” meaning okay. She describes her as being “a little reserved” (reserved). “To be reserved” means to be quiet, not to talk a lot, but also not to share your opinions – not to tell other people what you are thinking or feeling. Jessie is also described as being “soft (soft) – spoken (spoken).” A person who is “soft-spoken” doesn’t speak very loudly. Sometimes it’s hard to hear what they’re saying. I have never been called “soft-spoken.” I wonder why.
Jessie is soft-spoken and “on the shy (shy) side.” “To be shy” means to be perhaps uncomfortable being around other people or talking to other people. We might use the adjective “timid” (timid) to describe a person who is shy. “On the shy side” (side) means that she’s a little bit shy, maybe not all that much. Marcia describes the other woman, Kelly, as being someone who “talked our ear off.”
She says, “Kelly, on the other hand” – meaning in comparison to, or in addition to – “talked our ear off.” “To talk someone’s ear off” means to talk a lot, to talk too much. “No one could get a word in edgewise with her,” Marcia says. “To get a word in edgewise” (edgewise) means that you are almost unable to talk because the other person is talking so much. “To get a word in edgewise” would mean to give your opinion, or simply to say something, to someone who is talking so much, it’s very difficult to get a chance to talk.
Artem, however, says that he thinks Kelly’s anecdotes were funny. An “anecdote” (anecdote) is a funny, or humorous, story about something that really happened. It’s not the same as a joke. A “joke” is often something that is imaginary, that never took place. An anecdote is a story that is funny but that did take place. Artem describes Kelly as being “a little long-winded.” A person who is a “long (long) – winded (winded)” is a person who talks too much, who talks too long, so long that you begin to get a little bored by the person.
Artem says, “I enjoyed talking to her,” meaning Kelly, “more than trying to make conversation with Jessie” (the other woman). “To make conversation” with someone is to try to talk to a person. Americans, in some parts of the country, often make conversation with strangers – people whom they’ve never met before.
That doesn’t happen very often in Los Angeles or New York. In fact, if you try to make conversation with someone – say, at a grocery store or waiting for a bus – the person might think you’re a little weird, might even try to get away from you because that’s not what people do in big cities in the U.S., but in smaller towns and in certain areas in the United States, it’s very common for people “to make conversation,” even with people they don’t know very well.
Artem had difficulty making conversation with Jessie. That’s because, in Artem’s words, “she is so closemouthed and guarded that it” – making conversation – “was like pulling teeth.” “To be closemouthed” means to not be willing to speak. It’s similar to being shy. But it refers specifically to someone who doesn’t like talking.
“To be guarded” (guarded) means that you are careful and cautious, usually because you don’t want to tell someone something you don’t want them to know, a secret. Someone who is very guarded is someone who doesn’t tell you what he’s thinking, perhaps because he doesn’t want to tell you something that he thinks is a secret or wants to keep a secret. That’s why Artem found talking to Jessie “like pulling teeth.” This is a common expression, “like pulling (pulling) teeth.”
Something that is “like pulling teeth” is something that is very difficult to do, something that is very challenging, often because the other person doesn’t cooperate. The other person you’re trying to do this with doesn’t do what you want them to do, especially when it comes to talking. “Getting an answer from our lawyer that we could actually understand was like pulling teeth.” Our lawyer was always using these long words, these legal terms we didn’t understand. Or, “Trying to get my brother to answer a question is like pulling teeth.” It’s very difficult.
Marcia says, “I’d rather talk to someone who is a little reticent than a loudmouth.” “To be reticent” (reticent) means to be unwilling to share your opinion, to be unwilling to talk about a certain topic – perhaps because you don’t want to, perhaps because you don’t think the other person needs to know.
A “loudmouth” (loudmouth) – one word – is, as you might guess, a person who always talks very loudly and often too much, someone who perhaps tries to impress other people by bragging, by saying how good he is. A loudmouth is, in general, a person who we consider somewhat “obnoxious” – that is, not a very likeable person. Marcia prefers to talk to someone who is a little reticent than someone who’s a loudmouth.
Artem says, “Ooh, that’s a little harsh.” “To be harsh” (harsh) means to be a little mean, a little cruel, too unkind. Marcia says, “Maybe you’re right, but I don’t like the blathering, gossipy type.” “To blather” (blather) means to use a lot of words but not really to say anything. Someone who “blathers” is someone who maybe doesn’t know what they want to say but keeps talking anyway, or isn’t very intelligent and therefore simply talks without really thinking about it before he opens his mouth. So, “blathering” would be a person who is like that, who blathers.
“Gossipy” (gossipy) refers to someone who enjoys talking about other people and mentioning things that may or may not be true. “Gossip” is something that people talk about, often things that are bad about the other person that may be true or may not be true. Many magazines and newspapers publish gossip – things that may be true, but they may not, too. Another word for these things is “rumors” (rumors) – information that people tell other people even though they aren’t sure that the information is correct.
Marcia doesn’t like the “blathering, gossipy type,” meaning that kind of person. Artem says, “I wonder . . .” Marcia says, “What?” “I wonder what they’re saying about us.” Artem is wondering what their friends Jessie and Kelly might be saying about Artem and Marcia. The answer is probably nothing. People often think that other people are more interested in their lives than they really are, and we’re guessing their friends from work aren’t really all that interested in Marcia, Artem, and their particular relationship.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
[start of dialogue]
Marcia: Phew! I thought they’d never leave.
Artem: I enjoyed their company, didn’t you?
Marcia: Jessie is fine, a little reserved and soft-spoken, and on the shy side. Kelly, on the other hand, talked our ear off. No one could get a word in edgewise with her.
Artem: I thought Kelly’s anecdotes were funny. She was a little long-winded, I’ll admit, but I enjoyed talking to her more than trying to make conversation with Jessie. She is so closemouthed and guarded that it was like pulling teeth.
Marcia: I’d rather talk to someone who is a little reticent than a loudmouth.

Artem: I wonder . . .
Marcia: What?

There’s nothing blathering about our scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse. She always knows what she’s saying and how to say it.

What Else Does It Mean?
company
The word “company,” in this podcast, means the presence of another person, or time spent with others: “If you enjoy her company so much, ask her out on a date!” The phrase “two’s company, three’s a crowd” means that two people would rather be with each other, without anyone else, especially if those people are involved in a romantic relationship: “It’s nice of you to invite me to go out with you and Jake, but two’s a company and three’s a crowd.” The phrase “to be in good company” is used to reassure someone that other people have done the same thing: “Don’t worry about what you said. Famous politicians and celebrities have said much more embarrassing things during interviews, so you’re in good company.” Finally, the word “company” also refers to a business: “Which companies have you applied to?”
guarded
In this podcast, the word “guarded” means careful and cautious, not wanting to expose, show, or share something: “The nurses are trained to be very guarded about the patients’ health when speaking with their family members.” A “guard” is someone whose job is to protect a person or place: “The guards are asking everyone to show a piece of government-issued identification before entering the building.” A “guard dog” is a dog that is trained to bark at and/or bite unknown people to prevent them from entering the building: “All the neighbors are frightened by the Harrisons’ guard dog.” Finally, a “color guard” is a person who carries a flag representing an organization in a parade or ceremony: “Each high school marching band follows the school’s color guard.”
Culture Note
Chatty Cathy
Between 1959 and 1965, a well-known toy company called Mattel produced the Chatty Cathy dolls, which became almost as popular as “Barbie dolls” (slender, beautiful dolls; see English Café 140). The doll had a “pull-string” (a small string with a hook or circle on one end, and the other end inside a toy) that, when pulled, caused the doll to “talk.” She “randomly” (unpredictably; not knowing which one would come next) “spoke” phrases, which included, “I love you,” “Let’s play school,” “Please take me with you,” “Tell me a story,” and “May I have a cookie?”
The doll was originally a “Caucasian” (with white skin) doll with blue eyes and blonde hair. Later the company introduced Chatty Cathy dolls with darker hair, as well as an African American doll. Children could dress her in “outfits” (sets of clothing) that were sold separately.
7The doll was very popular and soon many other toys with “outfitted” (equipped) with similar pull-string devices so that they could “talk.” As Chatty Cathy’s success grew, Mattel introduced other dolls in the “line” (a group of related products), such as Chatty Baby, Tiny Chatty Brother, “Charmin’” (very appealing) Chatty, and Singin’ Chatty.
Although the dolls are no longer being produced today, we sometimes hear people refer to a woman as a “chatty Cathy.” This is to indicate that she talks too much, but of course this is not a polite phrase.
