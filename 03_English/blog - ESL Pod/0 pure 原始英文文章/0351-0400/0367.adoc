This episode is called “Going into the Military.” It’s a dialogue between Chantelle and Robert about life in the army, or in one of the military services. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Chantelle: Attention! Aren’t you supposed to salute?
Robert: You’re not my superior officer. Stop goofing around. I’m busy.
Chantelle: You’re packing already? You don’t need to report to duty for two days. Are you afraid they’ll think you went AWOL?
Robert: I just want to be prepared. Now, leave me alone so I can finish packing.
Chantelle: Am I dismissed? Maybe I want to enlist, too? I think I would look good in camouflage make-up and fatigues.
Robert: Being in the military is no laughing matter. Do you really think that the most desperate recruiter would want you?
Chantelle: That’s not very nice. I have as much discipline as you do...about some things. You may find yourself in a foxhole with me someday.
Robert: Whatever deployment you’d get, I’d make sure I’m on the other side of the world!
[end of dialogue]
This episode is about people who are in the military. “To be in the military” means to work for the government in the army or the navy, or some other military service. These are people who have gun that protect a country – their own country, we hope!
In the United States, the military is “all volunteer,” meaning that men and women are not required to go into the military, as they are in many countries. In the U.S., you “volunteer,” you say, “Okay, that’s what I want to do.” And if you don’t want to do it, you don’t do it, at least that has been the way the system has worked for the last 30 years or so.
In our dialogue Chantelle says to Robert, “Attention! Aren’t you supposed to salute?” “Attention” is a word that you shout at someone to get them to look or listen to you. It is often used in the military when the people who are working – the soldiers – are told by, for example, one of their bosses, such as a general, to stand “at attention,” or simply “attention,” every one needs to stand up and look like they are paying attention, they are listening to the general. “Attention” has a couple of different meanings; take a look at the Learning Guide for some more meanings of that word.
Chantelle says, “Aren’t you supposed to salute?” meaning don’t you have to, or shouldn’t you have to salute. “To salute” (salute) means to raise, usually, your right hand to your forehead, with the fingers held together straight; you touch those fingers on your forehead and then quickly move them a few inches to the right and front of your face. This is what happens when someone – a soldier in the military sees someone who is higher up – who is one of the bosses, if you will. They have to salute; they have to bring their arm up with their fingers against their forehead to show respect.
Robert says to Chantelle, “You’re not my superior officer. Stop goofing around. I’m busy.” Chantelle is joking with Robert. Robert says, “You’re not my superior officer.” Your “superior” is someone who is higher up, above you. An “officer” is a general word we give to someone who is in charge of, or is a supervisor in the military. So, your “superior officer” is someone who works in the army or the navy that has a higher level job than you. We would say a “higher rank,” that is, they have a higher position than you. Robert says, “Stop goofing around.” “To goof (goof) around” means to be silly, to not act seriously, to waste time. “The children were goofing around instead of studying.” Robert is saying to Chantelle, “I’m busy, stop bothering me, stop joking with me.”
Chantelle says, “You’re packing already?” meaning you are packing already – so soon? “To pack” means to put things that you will need usually into a suitcase, when you are traveling or going on a trip. “To pack” has a couple of different meanings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations. Chantelle says, “You don’t need to report for duty for two days.” “To report for duty” means to go to your job on the first day, to begin a new job, or in this case, to begin your first day of working in the military, in the army or the navy. The “army” are the soldiers, the people who fight on the land, and the “navy” are those that have boats and ships and fight on the ocean, or on the water.
Chantelle says, “You don’t need to report for duty for two days. Are you afraid they’ll think you went AWOL?” “AWOL” is an acronym (AWOL – all capital letters) that means “absent without leave.” If you are in the military and you suddenly decide not to go where you’re supposed to go – if you decide to stay home – you would be considered AWOL. This is something that the army and navy doesn’t like very much, and you will get in a lot of trouble – you will be punished if you go AWOL. Sometimes you’ll hear this expression for people who, for example, don’t come to work, or don’t show up to the job that they’re supposed to do, we might say they “went AWOL.” Notice the verb is “to go AWOL.”
Robert says, “I just want to be prepared. Now, leave me alone so I can finish packing.” Chantelle, once again joking with Robert, says, “Am I dismissed?” “To dismiss someone” is to say “leave the room,” to give someone permission to leave. This is often used in the military; someone may say, “You’re dismissed.” Your superior officer would tell you, “You’re dismissed,” meaning you can go now; I give you permission to leave.
Chantelle says, “Maybe I want to enlist, too?” “To enlist” means to sign up for something, to agree to participate in something. We often use this verb in talking about the military: “Frank enlisted in the navy when he turned 18 years old.” Chantelle says, “I think I would look good in camouflage make-up and fatigues.” “Camouflage” is a green, brown, and gray design that is used on clothing, and sometimes painted on people’s faces to make them more difficult to see. This is often a technique used in the military. “To camouflage,” as a verb, means to hide something by changing the appearance so it looks like everything around it. “Fatigues” are the clothing that someone in the military would wear, so Chantelle is joking, saying, “I think I would look good in camouflage make-up (on her face, for example) and fatigues (or clothing).”
Robert says, “Being in the military is no laughing matter” meaning it’s not funny; it’s nothing to laugh about or make jokes about. “Do you really think,” Robert says, “that the most desperate recruiter would want you?” “To be desperate” means that you have no other choices, that you need something very badly. A “recruiter” is a person whose job it is to get other people to work for his or her organization or group. The military has recruiters in most cities of the United States, and their job is to find men and women who want to work in the military. What Robert is saying is that no one would want Chantelle, even a very desperate recruiter who needed more people.
Chantelle says, “That’s not very nice (that’s not a nice thing to say). I have as much discipline as you do.” “Discipline” is the ability to control your actions, to control your behavior, to do what other people tell you to do, in this case. Chantelle says, “You may find yourself in a foxhole with me someday.” “You may find yourself” means you may be surprised to be in the same situation, in this case, to be in a foxhole. A “foxhole” is a small hole in the ground that soldiers lie in and hide in for protection, when they are shooting at other people. Chantelle is saying that someday I may be in a foxhole with you, working with you, fighting alongside you, next to you
Robert says, “Whatever deployment you’d get, I’d make sure I’m on the other side of the world!” “Whatever deployment,” whatever place that you were told to go, he’s saying, “I would make sure I was on the other side of the world,” nowhere close to you. So, “deployment” is the place where soldiers and equipment and supplies are taken. Usually we use the expression “on deployment.” For example: “Denise is on deployment in another country,” that’s where she is working for military.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
[start of dialogue]
Chantelle: Attention! Aren’t you supposed to salute?
Robert: You’re not my superior officer. Stop goofing around. I’m busy.
Chantelle: You’re packing already? You don’t need to report to duty for two days. Are you afraid they’ll think you went AWOL?
Robert: I just want to be prepared. Now, leave me alone so I can finish packing.
Chantelle: Am I dismissed? Maybe I want to enlist, too? I think I would look good in camouflage make-up and fatigues.

Culture Note
The United States Armed Forces, also known as the United States Military, “comprises” (is made up of) five “branches” (parts): the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard.
The U.S. Army is the oldest branch of the military. It was created in 1775 for the Revolutionary War against Britain. The Army is also the largest branch of the military, with more than one million members. Its soldiers fight mostly on land.
The U.S. Navy is smaller, with only about 500,000 people “in service” (working in the military). The Navy primarily works on the oceans and seas. It has almost 300 “ships” (large boats) and more than 4,000 “aircraft” (planes, helicopters, and other flying vehicles of different sizes).
The U.S. Marine Corps works closely with the U.S. Navy. It is the smallest military branch, with only about 200,000 members. It is very good at responding to “crises” (emergencies, or very urgent situations) quickly.
The U.S. Air Force was “founded” (created) in 1947 and mostly focuses on fighting that happens in the air. It has more than 6,000 aircraft, more than any other air force in the world.
Finally, the fifth branch of the U.S. military is the U.S. Coast Guard. It has a “broader” (wider and including more things) “mission” (purpose) than do the other branches of the military. The Coast Guard is supposed to protect the public, the environment, and the United States’ economic and security interests in “maritime” (related to the sea) regions.
The people who serve in the U.S. Armed Forces are very proud of their work, but they are often even more proud of the specific branch that they serve in. There are many friendly “rivalries” (competition between people or groups) between and among the different branches of the military.
