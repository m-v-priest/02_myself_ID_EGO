This episode is about singing Christmas carols or Christmas songs. Let’s get started.
[start of dialog]
Andrea: What are you doing?
Stephanie: I’m coming up with a list of Christmas carols to sing when we go caroling.
Andrea: Can I come?
Stephanie: Uh, I don’t think…
Andrea: What? You don’t think I can sing in tune?
Stephanie: No, it’s not that…
Andrea: You think I’m going to forget the lyrics?
Stephanie: No, it’s not that either…
Andrea: I know what it is. You think I’m too good. I’ll outshine the other singers. Don’t worry. I don’t mind hiding my light under a bushel, just this once.
Stephanie: Well, it’s not that either. I just don’t think you’re a good fit for our group.
Andrea: Not a good fit? I’m very knowledgeable about music and know all of the traditional carols. I’ve even composed some original ones that you might consider adding to your list.
Stephanie: I know you’re very knowledgeable about music, but in our group, it’s all about the singing voice.
Andrea: What’s wrong with my singing voice? Listen to this [sung loudly and poorly]: “Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way…”
[end of dialog]
Andrea begins by saying, “What are you doing?” Stephanie says, “I’m coming up with” – I’m thinking about, I’m inventing – “a list of Christmas carols to sing when we go caroling.” “Christmas” is the Christian holiday, now celebrated by people who aren’t Christian, on December 25th. And a “carol” (carol) is a traditional song that is sung during the Christmas season, during the weeks before and a few weeks after Christmas. “Caroling” (caroling) is a tradition where people get together in small groups and they go around and they sing Christmas carols in public, usually for other people, usually outside – that is, not inside of a building. I think I went Christmas caroling a couple of times when I was a teenager, not a lot. You don’t see people doing this very much anymore.
Andrea says, “Can I come?” He wants to go with Stephanie. “Can I come?” “Can I come with you?” Stephanie says, “Uh, I don’t think…” Andrea says, “What? You don’t think I can sing in tune?” “To sing in tune” (tune) means to be able to sing a song with the right notes, not being higher or lower than you should be. Many people say I cannot sing in tune. That’s probably true. Stephanie says, “No, it’s not that…” meaning it’s not that she thinks he can’t sing in tune. Andrea says, “You think I’m going to forget the lyrics?” Andrea is trying to understand why Stephanie is hesitant, that is, why she doesn’t seem to be very excited about him going with them on the Christmas caroling event. He says, “You think I’m going to forget the lyrics?” The “lyrics” (lyrics) are the words that are sung in the song. Stephanie says, “No, it’s not that either…”
Andrea says, “I know what it is. You think I’m too good.” You think I’m going to be so much better than the other singers. Andrea says, “I’ll outshine the other singers.” “To outshine” (outshine) – one word – means to be better than other people, to be, we might say, “superior” to other people. You’re so good that everyone sees how much better you are than the rest of the group. Singers, of course, are the people who sing.
Andrea says, “Don’t worry. I don’t mind hiding my light under a bushel, just this once.” “To hide the light under a bushel” (bushel) means not to let other people know or see how good you are at doing something, how smart you are or how talented you are. The expression comes from the Bible, from the New Testament, from one of the stories that Jesus tells in the Bible. The word “bushel” is what we would call a “unit of measurement” equal to about 36 liters. It’s a measure of volume, of capacity. But in the expression, it really refers to a large container, like a large basket or bucket that would be big enough to hold a bushel of something. If you turn the container upside down and put a light underneath it, of course, you can’t see the light. And that’s where the expression comes from.
Andrea is saying that because he is such a good singer, he won’t try to outshine the other singers. He won’t sing as good as he could sing. He says he’ll do this “just this once.” The expression “Just this once,” means only one time. You’re going to do something differently than the way you would normally do it.
Stephanie says, “Well, it’s not that either. I just don’t think you’re a good fit for our group.” “To be a good fit” (fit) means to be similar to other people or other things in a group, especially if you’re going to spend a lot of time with them. Sometimes companies will tell people interviewing for a job at that company that they’re not a “good fit for this position.” That means they don’t think you have the exact qualifications or characteristics that would work well in a certain job. Here, it means that Andrea isn’t like the rest of the group that’s going to be singing and so, it wouldn’t be a good fit.
Andrea says, “Not a good fit? I’m very knowledgeable about music and know all of the traditional carols.” Andrea says he knows a lot about music and he knows all of the “traditional” carols. “Traditional,” here, refers to things that have a long history, things that have been going on for a long time. Usually, we use this adjective in talking about culture or customs. “Traditional carols” would be carols that have been sung for many years, many generations even.
Andrea says that he knows all of the traditional carols. “I’ve even composed some original ones that you might consider adding to your list.” “To compose” (compose) means to create a new piece of music and, usually, write it down so that other people can play it themselves. Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Brahms – these were all great composers of earlier centuries. Anyone who writes the music for a song can be called a “composer,” with an -r at the end. “To compose,” however, is the verb.
Andrea says he’s composed some original carols. “Original,” here means new, that have not been created before. Stephanie says, “I know you’re very knowledgeable about music, but in our group, it’s all about the singing voice.” “The singing voice” is how well someone sings. Your “voice” (voice) is the sound that you make, that comes out of your mouth. Usually, you are saying something that people can understand, although my wife thinks I make a lot of noise that no one understands, at least, her.
Andrea is, according to Stephanie, someone who doesn’t have a very good singing voice. So, you see, Stephanie was lying earlier in the dialog when she said that it wasn’t about the fact that Andrea couldn’t sing in tune and so forth. Really, she doesn’t think Andrea is a very good singer. And now, we finally hear her say that directly. Andrea says, “What’s wrong with my singing voice? Listen to this…” And then he tries to sing a traditional carol called “Jingle bells.”
Jingle bells” (jingle bells) – two words – is a popular holiday song, a popular Christmas song describing the ringing or jingling of bells. The song goes “Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way…” But Andrea’s not a very good singer so it sounds like: “Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way…”
Wait a minute, that’s how I sound!
Now let’s listen to the dialog, this time at a normal speed.
[start of dialog]
Andrea: What are you doing?
Stephanie: I’m coming up with a list of Christmas carols to sing when we go caroling.
Andrea: Can I come?
Stephanie: Uh, I don’t think…
Andrea: What? You don’t think I can sing in tune?
Stephanie: No, it’s not that…
Andrea: You think I’m going to forget the lyrics?
Stephanie: No, it’s not that either…
Andrea: I know what it is. You think I’m too good. I’ll outshine the other singers. Don’t worry. I don’t mind hiding my light under a bushel, just this once.
Stephanie: Well, it’s not that either. I just don’t think you’re a good fit for our group.
Andrea: Not a good fit? I’m very knowledgeable about music and know all of the traditional carols. I’ve even composed some original ones that you might consider adding to your list.
Stephanie: I know you’re very knowledgeable about music, but in our group, it’s all about the singing voice.
Andrea: What’s wrong with my singing voice? Listen to this [sung loudly and poorly]: “Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way…”

What Else Does It Mean?
just this once
The phrase “just this once,” in this podcast, means one time only, especially when talking about doing something differently from how one normally does it: “I’ll help you clean your room just this once, but after today, you’ll have to do it on your own.” The phrase “at once” means immediately or right away: “Come in here at once!” The phrase “at once” can also mean simultaneously or at the same time: “How can you study and watch TV at once?” Finally, the phrase “once upon a time” is used to begin fairy tales and many children’s stories: “Once upon a time, a beautiful princess lived in a castle….”

In this podcast, the verb “to compose” means to create a new piece of music and write it down so that other people can re-create it: “Jacques has composed a few pieces for the guitar, but never anything for other instruments.” The verb “to compose” also means to write, especially formally: “How often do you compose speeches for your supervisor?” The phrase “to compose (oneself)” means to become in control of one’s emotions and appearance, especially when one is very upset: “Just give me a few minutes to compose myself, and then I’ll go back into the meeting room.” Finally, the verb “to compose can mean to arrange things in some way for an end product: “Sheila is very good at composing photographs.”
Culture Note
Animated Christmas TV Specials
Many Americans “eagerly” (with a lot of excitement and enthusiasm) look forward to “Christmastime” (the time before and during Christmas, from late November to late December) traditions. For many people, these traditions include watching the Christmas movies and TV specials. There are certain films and shows that are shown on TV every year around Christmas, and some people watch them every year.
One of the more “popular” (liked by many people) “animated” (with drawings, not with actors) Christmas TV specials is Rudolph the Red-Nosed “Reindeer” (a large animal like a deer, but with heavy antlers or horns on its head). The TV special shows how Rudolph was chosen to “guide” (lead) Santa’s “sleigh” (the vehicle Santa travels in) because his red nose served as a light through the “fog” (heavy clouds low to the ground).
Charlie Brown Christmas is an animated special showing a popular cartoon character and his friends as they look for the perfect Christmas tree and end up with a very small, “scrawny” (skinny, without many branches) tree. Frosty the Snowman is an animated TV special about a “snowman” (a figure made from snow) named Frosty who “comes to life” (becomes alive) and needs to find a way to the “North Pole” (the cold place where Santa lives) before he “melts” (warms up and turns into a liquid).
Another popular animated Christmas TV special is How the Grinch Stole Christmas, based on a children’s book by Dr. Seuss. It is about the “Grinch” (a green, monster-like character) who hates Christmas and tries to stop Christmas celebrations in a small town.
