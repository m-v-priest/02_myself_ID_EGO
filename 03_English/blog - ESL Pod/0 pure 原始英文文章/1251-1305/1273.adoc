This episode is a dialogue between Roberto and Ginny about making sure our schools are safe. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Roberto: All right, let’s get started. I organized this faculty and staff meeting to talk about ideas to improve school security.
Ginny: But we already have controlled access to school buildings, and all of the staff and faculty wear ID badges.
Roberto: Those measures help to keep people out of our school who don’t belong here. But in light of what’s happened at other schools, we need to do more to keep students safe.
Ginny: You mean in the event of bomb threats and mass shootings?
Roberto: Those are some of the threats we have to prepare for.
Ginny: I don’t know how we can prepare for those things.
Roberto: Well, we might consider security cameras and armed guards to patrol the school.
Ginny: Really?
Roberto: Really. We need to develop evacuation plans or procedures for lockdown in the event of an imminent threat.
Ginny: This is scary stuff.
Roberto: We live in scary times.
Ginny: It’s starting to feel like we work in a prison, not a school!
[end of dialogue]
Roberto begins by saying, “All right, let’s get started.” Roberto is talking to a group of people and he wants to start the meeting that they are having. He explains, “I organized” – or “I planned” – “this faculty and staff meeting to talk about ideas to improve school security.” The word “faculty” (faculty) refers to the teachers at a school. It could be a high school. It could be a college. I think of the word usually being associated with colleges, but high schools and other schools for children also sometimes use this word to describe the entire group of teachers at that school.
“Staff” (staff) can refer to anyone who works at a company or in an organization. In the case of schools, “staff” could refer to the teachers, but here it refers to everyone who works at the school who is not a teacher. That would include the janitors, the people in the kitchen, the administrators – that is, the principal and other leaders of the school –and so forth.
The meeting Roberto organized is all about “school security” (security). The word “security” can refer to a couple of different things. Here it refers to keeping people at the school safe. “School security” would be keeping the faculty, staff, and students safe so that there are no injuries, and more importantly that no one gets killed. Sadly, in the past several decades, there have been several cases where people have died at schools, usually because people outside of the school have brought guns and killed them, though sometimes it can be students in the school itself.
One of the people at the meeting, Ginny, says, “But we already have controlled access to school buildings, and all of the staff and faculty wear ID badges.” The term “controlled access” (access) refers to a system in a building where only the people who are supposed to be in certain parts of the building are allowed to go into those parts. It’s another way of saying a system of locks that prevent people who are not supposed to be in certain rooms or certain parts of the building from getting into those places.
Nowadays, many of these locks are electronic, so that you put a number into the lock in order to open it, or you use a special magnetic card that you either put through something called a “card reader” that allows you to open a door or you bring near a card reader pad (pad) that allows you to get into a certain part of a building. “Controlled access” might also involve guards – people who stand next to doors, allowing people in and preventing people from going in who are not supposed to be there.
Ginny says that they already have this kind of controlled access to the school buildings and “all of staff and faculty wear ID badges” (badges). “ID” stands for “identification.” A “badge” is usually a small card or piece of plastic that has your picture and name on it. So, an “ID badge” is something that you wear that tells everyone in the building who you are and that you belong there.
Roberto says, however, “Those measures,” meaning the things that we do already, “help to keep people out of our building who don’t belong here,” who aren’t supposed to be there. “But in light of what’s happened at other schools,” he says, “we need to do more to keep students safe.” The expression “in light (light) of” means considering, or thinking about, or because of. Roberto is saying that because of what has happened at other schools, their school needs to do more to keep students safe.
Ginny then asks, “You mean in the event of bomb threats and mass shootings?” The expression “in the event (event) of” means if or when something happens. “In the event of rain, we will not be playing the baseball game today.” That means if it rains, we won’t be playing baseball. Ginny says, “In the event of bomb (bomb) threats (threats) and mass (mass) shootings (shootings).”
A “bomb threat” is when someone says that there is a bomb in a certain place, and you better leave there or you might be killed. A “bomb” is a device, a thing that blows up and can kill you or hurt you. A “bomb threat,” then, is sometimes used to scare people to get people out of a certain place. A “mass shooting” is when many different people are killed, several people are killed in a short period of time.
Roberto says, “Those are some of the threats we have to prepare for.” Ginny says, “I don’t know how we can prepare for those things.” “I don’t know how we can get ready for a bomb threat or mass shootings,” she’s saying. Roberto says, “Well, we might consider,” meaning we should think about, “security cameras and armed guards to patrol the school.”
“Security cameras” are cameras, video cameras, that are usually put in the corner of a room or outside of a building to film or make a video of everything happening in that area. These are more common in other countries, I think, than in the U.S., especially in Great Britain. You hear a lot about something called “CCTV,” which stands for “closed-circuit television.” These are basically security cameras that film or take videos of everything that is happening in a room or in a certain area.
“Armed” (armed) means with a gun. A “guard” (guard) is a person whose job it is to protect a certain group of people or an area. So, “armed guards” are guards that have guns. Armed guards typically “patrol” (patrol). “To patrol” means to walk around a certain area or drive around a certain area in order to protect it and keep it safe. Roberto is suggesting that perhaps the school have guards with guns that would walk around the school in order to keep the students safe.
Ginny doesn’t think this is a good idea. She says, “Really?” She’s indicating her doubt by saying that. Roberto replies, “Really,” meaning yes. “We need to develop evacuation plans or procedures for lockdown in the event of an imminent threat.” An “evacuation” (evacuation) is when everyone has to leave a certain place because it’s dangerous there. An “evacuation plan” would be a plan or a list of steps that would be taken if, in this case, the school had to be evacuated. Notice there is a verb “to evacuate” from which we get the word “evacuation.”
A “lockdown” (lockdown) is when the doors of a building are locked to stop anyone from going out or coming in. This might be necessary if, for example, you want to prevent any of the children from leaving the school if there is someone dangerous near the school. An “imminent (imminent) threat” is something that is about to happen very soon. Anything that is “imminent” will be happening in the very near future, maybe in a few minutes or in a few hours or perhaps a few days.
Ginny says, “This is scary stuff.” Something that is “scary” (scary) is something that makes you afraid, something that gives you fear. Roberto says, “We live in scary times,” meaning we live in a dangerous period of history. Ginny says, “It’s starting to feel like we work in a prison, not a school.” A “prison” (prison) is a building where we keep criminals – people who have broken the law. Another word for “prison” is a “jail” (jail).
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

It’s about time!” Finally, the phrase “in no time at all” means very quickly: “Gerald made a delicious three-course meal in no time at all.”
Culture Note
Types of School Drills and Safety Procedures
Most schools have “drills” (actions that are practiced and repeated many times) and safety procedures “designed” (created) to protect students, faculty, and staff in emergency situations.
In many schools, fire drills “are held” (happen) every month or two. As soon as the fire “alarms” (loud lights and noises to warn of a danger) “go off” (turn on and make a loud noise), students “line up “(stand in a long line, with each person behind another person) and “file out” (walk out of the room in a line) while the teacher counts them. They walk to a “designated” (identified ahead of time) place, usually in a large field or parking lot next to the school. Teachers and staff try to “account for all the students” (make sure they know where all the students are) and wait for the “all-clear signal” (a noise or message that lets people know the danger has passed) before re-entering the building.
In areas that “are prone to” (have a lot of; are vulnerable to) “tornados” (large, dangerous storms with wind that moves quickly in circles), schools have “severe weather drills.” In these drills, students are taken to “interior” (in the inside of a building) rooms or a “basement” (a room below the surface of the earth). They are told to “crouch down” (bend their knees and fold their body down, with hands over one’s head and neck).
Finally, in a “lockdown drill,” teachers and students practice what they would do if a “shooter” (someone who is firing guns) came onto “campus” (all the buildings and surrounding area where a school is located). Usually, the students hide in a closet or under their desks while the teacher locks the doors and covers the windows.
