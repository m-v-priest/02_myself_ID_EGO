This episode is called “Snooping and Eavesdropping.” These are different ways of gathering or collecting information secretly, sometimes illegally. We’ll listen to a conversation Enrique and Stella, who are trying to get information about Stella’s boyfriend. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Enrique: I don’t know how you talked me into coming with you to Dan’s apartment to rifle through his papers. This snooping is stupid! If you have suspicions, you should just talk to him.
Stella: Confront him without any evidence? That would be the height of stupidity.
Enrique: Instead, we’re holed up in this closet until he leaves. I thought you said he wouldn’t be home until 6:00.
Stella: That’s what I thought. Just sit tight. I think he just came home to pick something up. He’ll be gone in a minute.
Enrique: I don’t like confined spaces. If we don’t make a break for it soon, I’m going to suffocate.
Stella: Stop your kvetching. Now that we’re here, maybe we can do better than looking through his papers. We can eavesdrop on his conversations.
Enrique: Have you lost your mind? Do you know what he would do to us if he found us here?
Stella: No guts, no glory!
[end of dialogue]
Enrique and Stella are inside of Dan’s apartment. In fact, they’re inside one of the closets of Dan’s apartment, the small space you use usually to put clothing or other things. Dan has come home unexpectedly while Enrique and Stella were there trying to find information about him.
Enrique says, “I don’t know how you talked me into coming with you to Dan’s apartment.” “To talk (someone) into (something)” is to get another person to agree to do something that they don’t really want to do, and usually we use this expression when you discover later that it was a mistake, that you should have said no. “I don’t know how you talked me into buying this car, it’s too expensive” – I should not have listened to you. The verb “to talk” has several different meanings; take a look at the Learning Guide for this episode for some more explanations.
Enrique says that he doesn’t know how Stella talked him into coming with her to Dan’s apartment to rifle through his papers. “To rifle through (something)” means to look through something quickly, usually to steal it, usually for reasons that are not good. Someone who’s looking for something who wants to steal something may rifle through your desk – the papers on your desk in order to find that something. Enrique says, “This snooping is stupid!” “To snoop” (snoop) means to spy, to look at things that you shouldn’t be looking at or that don’t belong to you, usually things that contain some sort of secret information. Enrique says, “If you have suspicions, you should just talk to him.” A “suspicion” is a thought or a feeling that something is wrong. You don’t have any proof, you don’t have any evidence, but you have a suspicion – you think that something might be wrong.
Stella says, “Confront him without any evidence?” “To confront (someone)” means to talk to someone or deal with something that is difficult or unpleasant, usually to talk to another person about a very difficult topic. Stella says, asking Enrique, “Confront him without any evidence? That would be the height of stupidity.” “Stupidity” is a noun for things that are stupid or foolish. The expression “the height of stupidity” means this would be extremely stupid, very stupid. We use this expression sometimes, “the height of” followed by some noun, usually when we’re expressing something negative that has happened, something very bad. For example: “That is the height of arrogance to tell the President of the United States that he should cut his hair.” It’s the height of arrogance – it’s the very extreme example, the highest example of that particular quality.
Enrique says, “Instead (instead of confronting Dan directly), we’re holed up in this closet until he leaves.” “To be holed up (somewhere)” means to be trapped in a small space and you can’t get out. You’re stuck; you can’t leave. If you go skiing and suddenly there’s a lot of snow and you can’t leave your hotel, you could be holed up in your hotel. Sometimes we use this expression when someone voluntarily goes somewhere that they don’t want to leave, to be separated from other people. But here, Enrique is using it to mean that they are in a small space, a closet, and they can’t leave. They can’t leave because they’re in Dan’s apartment, and Dan doesn’t know that they are there.
Stella tells Enrique to sit tight. “To sit tight” means to be patient and don’t move, don’t go anywhere else. “I think Dan just came home to pick up something up (or to pick something up – it means the same). He’ll be gone (he’ll leave) in a minute.” Enrique says, “I don’t like confined spaces.” “Confined” means you don’t have a lot of room, you can’t move easily. “Confined” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some more explanations.
Enrique says that he doesn’t like confined spaces – confined places. “If we don’t make a break for it soon,” he says, “I’m going to suffocate.” “To make a break for it” means to escape, to leave a place where you are trapped or that you’re not supposed to leave. A prisoner may try to make a break for it, meaning try to escape from the prison. Enrique says if they don’t make a break for it soon (if they don’t leave – escape out of this closet), he’s going to suffocate. “To suffocate” means to die because you can’t breathe. Someone may be preventing you from breathing by covering your mouth, or maybe there just isn’t enough oxygen in the air; that could also cause you to suffocate – to die because you can’t breathe.
Stella says to Enrique, “Stop your kvetching.” “To kvetch” is an informal expression meaning to complain loudly and repeatedly. Someone who’s always complaining, “Oh, it’s so hot in here. Oh, why can’t we get a better air conditioner (etc., etc.),” this is someone who likes to kvetch. The word “kvetch” is a Yiddish word, a language spoken by primarily Jewish immigrants to the United States. There are several Yiddish words that have become part of the general English language, at least American English.
Stella says to Enrique, “Stop your kvetching. Now that we’re here, maybe we can do better than looking through his papers. We can eavesdrop on his conversations.” “To eavesdrop” means to listen to something that you’re not supposed to hear, to secretly listen to someone else’s conversation. If someone is in a restaurant sitting next to you in the next table, and you’re not supposed be listening to their conversation but you are, that would be to eavesdrop. Often people eavesdrop in order to get information – to get secret information.
Enrique says, “Have you lost your mind?” “To lose your mind” means to go crazy, to do something very strange or even illogical. He says, “Do you know what he would do to us if he found us here?” “Do you know what he would do to us?” – do you know what sort of punishment he would give us, perhaps. Stella, however, says, “No guts, no glory!” “To have guts” means to have courage; it’s an informal expression. “No guts, no glory” means that if you don’t have courage – if you’re not willing to do something that’s difficult, you’ll never be able to win. In order to get things that you want, things that are difficult to obtain, you have to have guts, and if you don’t, you will never get those things. “Glory” here refers to either being famous but more generally getting something desirable that you want.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Enrique: I don’t know how you talked me into coming with you to Dan’s apartment to rifle through his papers. This snooping is stupid! If you have suspicions, you should just talk to him.
Stella: Confront him without any evidence? That would be the height of stupidity.
Enrique: Instead, we’re holed up in this closet until he leaves. I thought you said he wouldn’t be home until 6:00.
Stella: That’s what I thought. Just sit tight. I think he just came home to pick something up. He’ll be gone in a minute.

What Else Does It Mean?
to talk (someone) into
The phrase “to talk (someone) into (something),” in this podcast, means to get another person to agree to do something that he or she doesn’t really want to do: “How are we going to talk Leanne into letting us stay in her apartment for a month?” The phrase “to talk some sense into (someone)” means to say something that makes another person change his or her behavior or what he or she was planning to do: “Someone needs to talk some sense into Sakari before she hurts herself.” The phrase “to talk (someone’s) ear off” means to talk to someone too much: “Claudia talked his ear off, telling him about her work for hours.” Finally, the phrase “now you’re talking” is used to show another person that one agrees with what he or she has said: “When Brooke suggested making margaritas, we said, ‘Now you’re talking!’”
confined
In this podcast, the word “confined” means without very much room, or without allowing someone to move or stretch: “It must be difficult for astronauts to get used to living in such a confined space.” Or, “Junior feels too confined whenever he drives a small car.” The phrase “to be confined to (someone or something)” means to affect only a certain person, thing, or group: “These restrictions are confined to all new members, but not current members.” Or, “So far, the disease is confined to one state.” As a verb, “to confine” means to limit: “Their research is confined to information that was published in the past seven years.” Finally, the phrase “to be confined to (something)” means to be forced to stay in a particular place: “The patient was confined to his hospital bed for weeks.”
Culture Note
Normally, U.S. government agencies like the National Security Administration (NSA) must have a “warrant” (official permission to enter one’s home or look for something) for “domestic” (within the United States) “spying” (trying to find secret information) activities. However, in 2005, the New York Times published an article about how “then-President” (the person who was President at that time) George W. Bush “authorized” (allowed; gave official permission) the NSA to eavesdrop on Americans. The NSA didn’t have warrants or any other legal permission, but it started listening to Americans’ telephone conversations and getting copies of their “phone records” (a written history of telephone calls one has made and received).
The government argued that the eavesdropping and other types of domestic spying were necessary to look for “evidence” (proof) of terrorist activity after the attacks on September 11, 2001. However, since the government’s activities are secret, nobody knows how many conversations the NSA listened to, and whether they were limited to just “suspected” (thought to have done something wrong) terrorists.
Most Americans thought it was a “violation” (something that breaks a rule or law) of their “privacy” (one’s right to have secrets or not share information). The Fourth “Amendment” (a section of text added to the U.S. Constitution, or America’s most important legal document) protects Americans against “unreasonable” (not justified) searches. Many people think the eavesdropping was unreasonable, but the government argues that the eavesdropping was necessary to protect Americans from terrorists.
This has become known as the domestic spying “controversy” (something that people do not agree on, but have very strong opinions about).
