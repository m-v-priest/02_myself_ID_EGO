[end of dialogue]
Our dialogue begins with Teresa saying to Adrian, “Hey, where are you going? We have a meeting in 10 minutes.” Adrian says, “I’m sorry. I’m going to have to postpone.”“To postpone” (postpone) means to do something later than you had planned on or than had been originally scheduled. It’s to change the time or even the day of something.Usuallywe postpone something when there’s some problem, some difficulty in doing what we were planning on doing.
Adrian says,“I’m in the middle of putting out fires, and I’ve had to clear my schedule to deal with the latest crisis.”The expression “to put out” something, as a phrasal verb, means to either turn something off(for example, “I put out the lights”)or to extinguish a fire – to stop the fire from burning.“The firefighters put out the fire in the house.” Here, however, “putting out fires” is used to mean taking care of difficult situations, taking care and providing solutions for difficult problems – often, problems that come up without a lot of warning.
“To clear your schedule” means to free time in your day to cancel other things, usually so that you can spend time on, in this case, “putting out fires” – taking care of some immediate problems that must be solved right away.A“crisis” (crisis) is a very important and urgent or immediate problem – a problem you have to take care of or deal with right away. That’s a “crisis.”
Well, in our dialogue, it seems that Adrian has some sort of crisis. Teresa says,“Can I help?” Adrian says,“I wish you could,” meaning “I wish you could help, but you can’t.”He says,“With the new layoffs, I feel like I’m being pulled in several directions at once.” A “layoff,” as a noun, is when someone is fired from his or her job –when you lose your job.If a company is having difficulty and it’s not making very much money, there may be layoffs – people who are, to use the verb form now,“laid off.”“To lay off” is a phrasal verb and is two words.A“layoff” as a noun is one word.
So, at Adrian’s company, it seems as though there have been layoffs,and this means, we’re guessing, that he has to do more work since there are fewer people working there. That’s why he says,“I feel like I’m being pulled in several directions at once.”“To be pulled (pulled) in several directions at once” means to need to do a lot of different things, especially when the number of things that you have to do is great. There are a lot of things that you have to do all at the same time or with some sense of urgency.
Adrian says,“As soon as I feel like I’m making headway with one problem, I get another thrown at me.”“To make headway” (headway) is a phrasal verb meaning to make progress, to advance toward some goal.“We’re making headway on the paperwork we have to complete” – we’re making progress, we’re doing better.
Every time that Adrian feels as though he is making headway with one problem, he says, “I get another thrown at me.”“Thrown (thrown) at”is an expression that means “imposed on another person,” especially when it’s some responsibility that you would rather not have.“My boss has thrown several problems at me.” I have to take care of them.He has told me to take care of them. “Thrown” is, obviously, the past participle of the verb “to throw.”
Teresa says,“I know exactly what you mean. I always feel like it’s crunch time around here because we’re so shorthanded.”The phrase “crunch (crunch) time” refers to a period of time when a lot of things have to be completed, and you have to work really hard in order to complete them. Many students, for example, wait until the last week of their class to do their big project – then, it’s crunch time.They have to get a lot of things done in a small amount of time. “To be shorthanded” means to not have enough people to do a job. Teresa complains that the company is shorthanded; it doesn’t have enough employees, enough people to do all the work that needs to be done.
Adrian says,“I’m so tired of everything being urgent all the time and needing attentionASAP.”“To be urgent” (urgent) means to need immediate attention – something that you have to do right away. It can’t wait – that’s urgent.In Adrian’s case, he says he’s “tired of everything being urgent all the time and needing attention ASAP.”“ASAP” is an acronym for“as soon as possible.”As soon as possible – without delay, in other words.
Adrian continues,“I long for the days when projects had timelines and people followed them.”“He longs for the day” means he wants very badly to return to the time when this certain thing happened – in this case,“when projects had timelines and people followed them.”So, “to long for” something means to desire something, to want it a great deal.“Timelines” (timelines) are schedules, plans about when things are going to be completed. Adrian says,“I’ve got to go,” meaning I have to leave now.
Teresa says, “Hey, when are we going to have that meeting?”In other words, when are we going to have the meeting that we were supposed to have in 10 minutes? Adrian says,“As soon as things quiet down.”“To quiet (quiet) down” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to become calmer, to not be rushing so much.“To rush” (rush) means to go fast.So, to be relaxed, to be calm. Sometimeswe use this phrasal verb to mean to not talk so loud or to be quiet.“To quiet down a group of students” would be to get the students to stop talking so loudly. Teachers have to do that all the time.
Teresa says,“When will that be?”That is, when will things quiet down? Adrian says,“I’ll let you know as soon as the latest disaster has been averted.”A“disaster”(disaster)is a serious, large problem that has very negative consequences. We sometimes talk about “natural disasters”– that would be an earthquake or a flood or a big snowstorm. These things cause damage and therefore have negative consequences. You can also have a disaster in your own life; something bad could happen to you. Maybe you lose your cat. Would that be a disaster?Maybe.Not for me.
The verb“to avert” (avert) means to prevent something from happening or to avoid something.You’ll often hear this verb or see this verb in writing with the word “disaster.”“We’re trying to avert a disaster”– we’re trying to prevent something bad from happening.Adrian is saying here that he won’t have time, until there are no crises, to meet with Teresa.
Now let’s listento the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Culture Note
Smokey the Bear
“Smokey Bear,” often called “Smokey the Bear,” is a “mascot” (a cartoon animal or other character that represents a team or organization) for the United States Forest Service, the federal agency that protects America’s “forests” (areas with many trees). Smokey the Bear first appeared in an advertising campaign in 1944 with the “slogan” (a saying used in marketing and advertising) of “Smokey says care will prevent nine out of 10 forest fires.” Today, most people associate Smokey the Bear with a different slogan: “Only you can prevent forest fires.”
Smokey the Bear was created to encourage people to be more “cautious” (careful) and to prevent forest fires, especially by selecting appropriate “sites” (places) for “campfires” (fires burned for cooking, heat, and entertainment while outdoors) away from tree branches, and “dousing” (pouring water over) campfires before leaving them “unattended” (without someone nearby and watching something).
Smokey the Bear is “depicted” (shown) as a drawing of a brown bear wearing jeans and a large hat with his name in red letters, holding a “shovel” (tool with a long handle used for digging and moving dirt). Smokey can be found in television ads, promotional materials distributed at national parks and in schools, and even as a walking mascot at national parks.
The Ad Council reports that 95% of adults and 77% of American children recognize Smokey the Bear and his message. But some people argue that the campaign has been too successful in “vilifying” (making something seem bad or evil) wildfires. People have been taught that all forest fires are bad, but in reality, some forest fires are necessary to maintain forest health.
