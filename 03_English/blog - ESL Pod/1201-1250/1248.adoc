This episode is a dialogue between Oleg and Raquel about describing machines – equipment – that are old and new. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Oleg: Geez, look at that dinosaur.
Raquel: This is not a dinosaur. It’s a classic. It will never go out of style and it’s built to last.
Oleg: It’s an antique and belongs in a museum. You’ve got to get with it and get one of these.
Raquel: What’s that?
Oleg: It’s the latest model, with cutting edge design. It’s brand spanking new.
Raquel: That’s all right. This machine is tried-and-true and it never lets me down.
Oleg: Why don’t you take this for a test drive? It’ll be an eye-opening experience for you.
Raquel: No, thanks.
Oleg: You don’t know what you’re missing.
Raquel: That’s true, but I’m happy with my machine.
Oleg: Fine. I’m just trying to help you move with the times.
Raquel: Thanks, but no thanks. I’ll stick with what I know and love.
Oleg: It just goes to show there’s no accounting for taste.
[end of dialogue]
Oleg begins our dialogue by saying to Raquel, “Geez, look at that dinosaur.” “Geez” (geez) is a word we used to express surprise or amazement at something. Oleg is amazed at a “dinosaur” (dinosaur). The word “dinosaur” usually refers to an animal that is no longer found living on Earth. However, we also use the word “dinosaur” to describe something or even someone who is very, very old. In describing a person, it usually refers to someone in leadership or power in an organization or a government.
When it’s used to describe a piece of equipment, a machine, it refers to something that is no longer very usable because it is so old. So, if you have a computer from the 1980s, it would probably be described as a “dinosaur” because it’s so old you can’t really use it for anything. Raquel disagrees with Oleg’s description of her machine. She says, “This is not a dinosaur. It’s a classic.” A “classic” (classic) is something that is old but is considered to be of very high quality, something that people admire or recognize as being good.
We might describe an old car as a “classic.” In fact, people talk about “classic cars,” or “classic movies.” These are things that we consider to have a lot of value or to be of high quality. Citizen Kane or The Godfather might be described as “classic movies.” Don’t confuse “classic” with “classical” (classical). “Classical” usually refers to something from the ancient Greek or Roman period of history, at least in the Western world. Raquel says her machine is “a classic.” She says, “It will never go out of style and it’s built to last.”
“To go out of style” means to be no longer very popular, to no longer be what we might describe as “fashionable” – something that people like, something that people want to have. Certain ways of dressing “go out of style.” People no longer wear that kind of shirt or those kinds of pants. Raquel says, however, that what she has “will never go out of style.” She says, “It’s built to last” (last). If something is “built to last,” it will not break or stop working in the future. Something that is “built to last” is built very well. It’s constructed very well.
Oleg says, however, “It’s an antique and belongs in a museum.” An “antique” (antique) is some object that is considered old. Usually we talk about something more than 100 years old as being an “antique.” Furniture, art, pottery – other objects that people like to collect, like to own, are often referred to as “antiques” if they are very old. I love watching television programs about antiques. I like to watch a British show called Bargain Hunt where they go and try to find antiques. I know it’s a little weird.
Anyway, Oleg says that he thinks the machine that Raquel has “belongs in a museum” (museum). A “museum” is a building that has objects that are either very old or are pieces of art that people want to look at. In this case, he thinks this object is very old. He says, “You’ve got to get with it and get one of these.” “To get with it” is an expression meaning to become familiar with what is happening now, to understand things that are going on right now or that are popular now.
Raquel asks, “What’s that?” Oleg is showing her something. Oleg says, “It’s the latest model,” meaning it’s the most recent kind of this thing. He says it has “cutting edge design.” The expression “cutting (cutting) edge (edge)” means very modern, or with the latest technology, the latest advanced design. He says, “It’s brand spanking new.” The expression “brand (brand) new” means that it is very new, that it has not been used by anyone else before you bought it. That’s something that is “brand new.”
The word “spanking” (spanking) in this expression is used for emphasis. It means the same as “very” or “extremely.” “It’s really brand new.” “It’s brand spanking new.” It’s somewhat unusual to see that construction of putting the adjective after “brand” – “brand spanking new.” You might think it would be “spanking brand new,” but it isn’t. We say “brand spanking new.” It’s an idiom. It’s just the way that we express that particular idea with those words. It just means “very new.”
Raquel says, “That’s all right,” meaning no, she isn’t interested. “This machine” – the one that she owns – “is tried-and-true and it never lets me down.” To describe something as “tried (tried) – and – true (true)” means that it has been tested and proven to work well. It’s something that you have used for a long time and you know that it works. That’s something that is “tried-and-true.” The word “tried” here means tested, or used to make sure that it works.
The machine, according to Raquel, never lets her down. “To let (let) someone down” means to disappoint someone, to do something that does not meet someone’s expectations. Raquel says this machine never lets her down. Oleg says, “Why don’t you take this for a test drive?” The expression “to take something for a test (test) drive” means to try something for a short time to see if you like it, especially something you are considering buying.
If you are going to buy a car, you would go to a place that sells cars, called a “car dealership,” and you would take a car for a “test drive.” You would get in and drive the car. We use that expression “to take something for a test drive” more generally to refer to trying anything, usually a machine of some sort, for a short time to see if you like it and want to buy it.
Oleg says that taking whatever he has for a test drive “will be an eye-opening experience” for Raquel. Something that is “eye (eye) – opening” is something that makes you aware of something or gives you knowledge about something in a way that you have never had before or have never been given before. If you call an experience “eye-opening,” it means it made you see things or realize things – maybe good, maybe bad – that you had not realized or seen before.
Raquel, however, is not interested. She says, “No, thanks.” Oleg responds, “You don’t know what you’re missing.” The expression “You don’t know what you’re missing” means that you are not aware of the good things that someone else knows about or that I know about. Raquel says, “That’s true, but I’m happy with my machine.” Oleg says, “Fine,” meaning okay. “I’m just trying to help you move with the times.”
The expression “to move with the times” is similar to “to get with it.” It means to change your attitude or to change your actions so that you can do what other people are doing. It also means to be more modern, to do things that other people are doing nowadays. Raquel says, “Thanks, but no thanks,” meaning thank you for offering that, but I am not interested. She says, “I’ll stick with,” meaning I will continue using, “what I know and love” – what I am familiar with.
Oleg ends the dialogue by saying, “It just goes to show there’s no accounting for taste.” There are two expressions there. The first one is “It just goes to show (show).” “It just goes to show” is a phrase used when you want to emphasize what another person has said or demonstrated. You are coming to a conclusion. You are making an observation about something. Oleg’s observation is another common expression, “There’s no accounting (accounting) for taste (taste).”
“There’s no accounting for taste” is a phrase that means that it’s impossible to understand the things that other people like and dislike. There’s no reason, there’s no rational basis sometimes, for why some people like some things and dislike other things. I like apple pie and coffee and spaghetti and dumplings and different kinds of noodles. Other people like other food that I don’t like. There’s no good reason. You can’t make an argument why one thing is better than another when it comes to food. That’s why we say, “There’s no accounting for taste.”
“Taste,” however, means more than just what kind of food you like. It’s a general term to describe the things that people like and dislike in other people or in other objects. This expression is sometimes used as a criticism – for another person to say, “You have bad taste.” That’s what Oleg is doing here. He’s saying that Raquel doesn’t have good taste because she continues to use this old machine, whatever it is, instead of moving with the times and using a new machine.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
[start of dialogue]
Oleg: Geez, look at that dinosaur.
Raquel: This is not a dinosaur. It’s a classic. It will never go out of style and it’s built to last.
Oleg: It’s an antique and belongs in a museum. You’ve got to get with it and get one of these.
Raquel: What’s that?
Oleg: It’s the latest model, with cutting edge design. It’s brand spanking new.
Raquel: That’s all right. This machine is tried-and-true and it never lets me down.
Oleg: Why don’t you take this for a test drive? It’ll be an eye-opening experience for you.
Raquel: No, thanks.
Oleg: You don’t know what you’re missing.
Raquel: That’s true, but I’m happy with my machine.
Oleg: Fine. I’m just trying to help you move with the times.
Raquel: Thanks, but no thanks. I’ll stick with what I know and love.
Oleg: It just goes to show there’s no accounting for taste.

What Else Does It Mean?
classic
The word “classic,” in this podcast, means an older thing that is widely admired and recognized as having value even when compared with more modern items: “This old computer is a classic. How can you even think about throwing it away?” When talking about literature, “the classics” are books that are greatly admired within a particular culture: “The American classics include The Grapes of Wrath, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Atlas Shrugged, To Kill a Mockingbird, and many other novels.” Finally, the word “classic” can also mean a perfect, exact, or ideal example of something: “She made a classic mistake in the job interview by focusing on how the job would benefit her rather than how she could contribute to the company.”
cutting edge
In this podcast, the phrase “cutting edge” means very modern, using the newest sophisticated technology: “This app is a cutting edge way for people to track how far they run each day.” A “cutting remark” is something someone says to hurt another person: “Whenever I see Sheila, she always makes a cutting remark about my weight.” When talking about plants, a “cutting” is a piece that is cut off of a plant and put in soil (dirt) or water to grow a new plant: “May I take a few cuttings from your philodendron?” Finally, a “press cutting” or a “newspaper cutting” is an article cut from a printed newspaper or magazine for future reference: “This binder contains press cuttings about her career in films.”
Culture Note
Collectible Classic Machines
Many people “collect” (gather many similar objects for display or use as a hobby) classic machines and equipment. Many of these machines are items that have been replaced by more modern technology. For example, some people collect “typewriters” (machines that allow people to type onto paper, without using a printer), which are no longer used very often because computers are “generally considered” (thought by most people) to be a “superior” (better) technology. But some of the old typewriters are now “sought-after” (strongly desired by a group of people) antiques.
Other people collect “domestic appliances” (machines that help to perform household chores). Some people collect “vintage” (old; antique) sewing machines, “vacuum cleaners” (machines that suck up air and dirt to clean carpets), and “washers” (machines for cleaning clothes). Small appliances and “kitchen utensils” (small tools used for cooking) are also popular collectors’ items. Old coffee “grinders” (tools for breaking coffee beans into a fine powder), “waffle irons” (machines used for making waffles, or sweet, square-shaped breakfast pastries similar to pancakes), and “egg beaters” (a tool that, when the handle is moved in a circle, stirs eggs or other items very quickly to add in air) can all be collectibles” (items that are collected).
Many collectibles are “solely” (only) for “display” (for showing to other people), but some people enjoy using the older machines. For example, even though “nowadays” (in modern times) we have electric ice-cream makers, some people prefer to pour salt and ice into a container and turn a “hand crank” (a metal handle that one must push in circles) for hours in order to make ice cream “the old-fashioned way” (the way things used to be done).
