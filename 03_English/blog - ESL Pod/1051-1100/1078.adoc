Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 1,078 – Watching Action Movies.
This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 1,078. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

[start of dialogue]
Claude: Oh no, this isn’t another action movie, is it?
Jean: Of course not. I know you like thrillers, and this is a thriller.
Claude: This definitely seems like a brainless action movie to me. That’s the second fight scene, and we’re only 15 minutes into the film.
Jean: It’s a thriller that’s supposed to keep you on the edge of your seat. Of course it’ll have some fight scenes.
Claude: And car chases? We’ve had three of those already, too.
Jean: Like any good thriller, it has a hero in a life-threatening situation and an evil villain in hot pursuit.
Claude: That sounds like a run-of-the-mill action movie to me. This movie is full of visual effects and stunts. It’s all about the adrenaline rush. It’s not what I would call a psychological thriller.
Jean: Maybe it straddles the line between an action film and a thriller, but it’s good, isn’t it?
Claude: I’ll let you know once this ultra-violent fight scene is over.
[end of dialogue]
Claude begins the dialogue by saying, “Oh no, this isn’t another action movie, is it?” An “action (action) movie” is a movie that has usually a lot of fighting, a lot of car chases, often a lot of violence. Action movies have a hero – a good guy – and then one or more bad guys that the good guy, of course, fights. Jean says, “Of course not. I know you like thrillers, and this is a thriller.” A “thriller” (thriller) is also an exciting movie, but instead of having a lot of fights or violence, it involves a lot of surprise or even fear.
Now, sometimes there can be violence in a thriller as well, but a thriller would be a movie during which you are waiting to see what will happen. You’re going to be surprised at what happens. In an action movie, you’re often not surprised at what happens. You kind of know what’s going to happen – the good guy is going to win. But in a thriller, there’s more of what we would call “suspense” (suspense) – when you don’t know what’s going to happen.
Claude says, “This definitely seems like a brainless action movie to me.” “Brainless” means that it isn’t very smart. It isn’t very intelligent. Your “brain” (brain), of course, is what’s in your head, or at least what’s in most people’s heads. I’m not quite sure about my neighbor. “Brainless” (less) would be someone who didn’t have a brain, or not a very big brain. The term “brainless” is an insulting one to describe something you think is stupid or not very intelligent. Claude says that this is “a brainless action movie” that Jean is watching.
He says, “That’s the second fight scene, and we’re only 15 minutes into the film.” A “fight scene” (scene) is a part of a movie where, of course, people are fighting. When we talk about “scenes” in a movie, we’re talking about different parts or sections of the movie with the same characters or people in the same place. Claude says, “This is the second fight scene, and we’re only 15 minutes into the film,” meaning we’ve only been watching the movie for 15 minutes.
Jean says, “It’s a thriller that’s supposed to keep you on the edge of your seat.” When we say something keeps you “on the edge (edge) of your seat,” we mean that there’s a lot of excitement, a lot of suspense, a lot of anticipation. Everyone is eager or very much interested in finding out what’s going to happen next. A thriller keeps you on the edge of your seat. If you’re sitting on a chair on the edge of your seat – “seat” is another word for chair – you are just about to get up or you are leaning forward towards the front of the chair. If you’re relaxed, you would be sitting back against the back of the chair.
Jean says, “Of course it’ll have some fight scenes,” meaning the movie will have some fight scenes even though it is a thriller. Claude doesn’t seem to agree with Jean. He says, “And car chases? We’ve had three of those already, too.” A “car chase” (chase) is when one car tries to catch another car, both of them usually going very fast. Action movies typically have lots of car chases in them. Claude is saying that this isn’t really a thriller because it has all of the elements, or parts, of an action movie, such as car chases.
Jean disagrees. She says, “Like any good thriller, it has a hero in a life-threatening situation and an evil villain in hot pursuit.” A “hero” (hero) is a good guy – the person, man or woman, who is the main character of the movie and is the one that is going to beat, or defeat, the bad guys. If you’re in a “life-threatening situation,” you’re in a situation where you could die. And of course, in movies that is often the case.
The hero always fights against a “villain” (villain). A villain is a bad guy in the movie, the opposite of the hero. Jean calls him “the evil villain,” but villains are always evil. “Evil” just means bad. Jean says that this movie has “a hero in a life-threatening situation and an evil villain in hot pursuit.” The word “pursuit” (pursuit) comes from the verb “to pursue” (pursue). “To pursue” means to run after or chase after someone – to try to catch someone who is escaping from you or who is trying to get away from you.
“To pursue” can also mean simply to go on a certain path to try to obtain some goal. We talk about students “pursuing” a degree in history. They are trying to get a degree in history. Just like me. What do you do with a degree in history? Well, you become a podcaster. Anyway, back to the dialogue.
We have a villain in hot pursuit. If you say someone is “in hot pursuit” of another person, the person is chasing someone very closely, almost catching him or her. Claude says, “That sounds like a run-of-the-mill action movie to me.” “Run-of-the-mill” is an expression that means ordinary – not very interesting, not unusual. It’s usually used as a way of describing something that isn’t special in any way. It’s just like perhaps a thousand other types of that thing. “This is a run-of-the-mill microphone.” It’s not a great microphone. It’s an average microphone. There’s nothing special about it.
Claude says, “This movie is full of visual effects and stunts.” “Visual” (visual) refers to something you can see. In movies, when we talk about “visual effects” (effects), we’re talking about things that usually involve using computers or some sort of trick with the camera to make something look real when it isn’t, when it isn’t actually there.
“Special effects” are often used to show buildings blowing up or planes crashing to the ground, even though the people who made the movie didn’t actually blow up or destroy a building. They use often, computer software nowadays, or other special tricks to make it look as though that were happening. “Stunts” (stunts) are dangerous actions that one of the characters in the movie performs.
Here in Hollywood, here in Los Angeles, there are people who are what are called “stuntmen” or “stuntwomen,” and they go in and do these dangerous actions so that the actor or actress doesn’t have to. Some actors and actresses, however, like to do their own stunts, meaning they don’t like to have a stunt person doing the dangerous actions in the movie; they like to do their own stunts.
Claude says that this movie is “all about the adrenaline rush.” When we talk about someone having an “adrenaline (adrenaline) rush (rush),” we’re talking about someone who has a sudden feeling of excitement, a sudden feeling of extra energy, often in response to stress or danger. Adrenaline is a chemical, a hormone in your body that is released when you are in a dangerous situation, often.
Claude says, “It’s not what I call a psychological thriller.” A “psychological thriller” is a thriller that focuses on the emotions, thoughts, and ideas of the main character in order to create this suspense, this anxiety. Think of the movies of Alfred Hitchcock, the great English director of the twentieth century. He created a lot of interesting psychological thrillers.
Jean says, “Maybe it,” meaning the movie, “straddles the line between an action film and a thriller.” “To straddle (straddle) the line” means to have characteristics of two different things, so that you can’t really tell what it is. Is it one thing or is it another thing? That’s what Jean is saying about this movie. It’s both a thriller and an action movie.
She asks Claude if the movie is good. Claude replies, “I’ll let you know once this ultra-violent fight scene is over.” We already know what a fight scene is. If you describe a fight scene as “ultra-violent,” you mean it is very violent. The term “ultra” (ultra) is sometimes added in front of a word to mean it has a lot of something. It’s a way of saying it is very much this thing. So, if we say something is “ultra-violent,” we mean that it is really violent or very violent.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
[start of dialogue]
Claude: Oh no, this isn’t another action movie, is it?
Jean: Of course not. I know you like thrillers, and this is a thriller.
Claude: This definitely seems like a brainless action movie to me. That’s the second fight scene, and we’re only 15 minutes into the film.
Jean: It’s a thriller that’s supposed to keep you on the edge of your seat. Of course it’ll have some fight scenes.
Claude: And car chases? We’ve had three of those already, too.
Jean: Like any good thriller, it has a hero in a life-threatening situation and an evil villain in hot pursuit.
Claude: That sounds like a run-of-the-mill action movie to me. This movie is full of visual effects and stunts. It’s all about the adrenaline rush. It’s not what I would call a psychological thriller.
Jean: Maybe it straddles the line between an action film and a thriller, but it’s good, isn’t it?
Claude: I’ll let you know once this ultra-violent fight scene is over.

Our scripts don’t have a lot of ultra-violent fight scenes in them, but we think they’re pretty interesting all the same. Thanks to Dr. Lucy Tse for writing them.

What Else Does It Mean?
in hot pursuit
The phrase “in hot pursuit,” in this podcast, means immediately following someone, or chasing someone very closely and almost catching up with him or her: “The second-place winner was in hot pursuit of the lead runner throughout the entire race.” The word “pursuit” describes actively trying to reach, get, or have something: “She has submitted over one hundred applications in pursuit of a higher-paying job.” Finally, “pursuits” and especially “leisure pursuits” are formally used to refer to hobbies and other activities that one does in one’s free time: “His leisure pursuits include golf, horseback riding, and wine tasting.”

Culture Note
Swashbuckler Films
“Swashbuckler films” are a “genre” (type of story or art) of action films with strong heroes who “engage in” (participate in) many fights, especially “sword fights” or “fencing,” which are “disputes” (disagreements) fought with “swords” (long weapons like very sharp, long knives with a fancy handle). The heroes are almost always men who fight against “clear” (unquestioned) villains. The women in the films are usually “helpless” (unable to help themselves) “damsels in distress” (a woman who needs a man to rescue her).
Most swashbuckler films are “set” (created to show action at a specific time and place) in Western Europe in the Renaissance. The actors wear “elaborate” (very detailed) and “lavish” (expensive, luxurious, and elegant) “costumes” (clothing worn by an actor to play a particular character).
In the past, a “swashbuckler” was a man with poor sword-fighting skills who covered his inabilities by “bragging” (saying good things about oneself), but now a “swashbuckler” is better described as a “loudmouthed” (very opinionated, saying too much, too loudly) hero.
Swashbuckler films were very popular at the “advent” (beginning; first appearance) of film. Many of the stories were based on romantic novels, and the films “incorporated” (included and used) very dramatic music.
Popular swashbuckler films include The Mask of Zorro, The Three Musketeers, The Count of Mote Cristo, and The Scarlet Pimpernel. More modern swashbuckler films include Pirates of the Caribbean and The Princess Bride.
