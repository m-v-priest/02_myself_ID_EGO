This episode is called “Praising a Performance.” It’s a dialogue between Claudia and Javier. They’ll be talking about a performance, I believe it’s like a play in a theater, and using vocabulary that you would use to describe performances such as plays or movies. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Claudia: Oh, that was so good. I’ve never seen anything better. Bravo! Bravo!
Javier: There’s no need for a standing ovation and stop gushing. The performers did a passable job. It was nothing to write home about.
Claudia: You are so jaded. That performance was genius. It took my breath away.
Javier: I thought the first number was okay, and none of the dancers embarrassed themselves, but that’s all I can say about it.
Claudia: I’m sure they’d thank you for that faint praise. Me? I’ve never seen anything better.
Javier: Now how can you say that? That’s just over the top.
Claudia: If I can’t be effusive, who can? How many times will we see our granddaughter in a school play?
Javier: She’s seven years old and she played a tomato!
Claudia: Yes, but don’t forget: she played the lead tomato!
[end of dialogue]
Claudia begins by saying, “Oh, that was so good. I’ve never seen anything better (anything better than that). Bravo!”, she says, “Bravo!” “Bravo” is a word that is shouted by audience members to congratulate a performer for doing a very good job right after they finish. So someone may sing a song particularly well, and everyone at the end stands up and “claps” their hands, put their hands together and says, “Bravo!” especially if it is, for example, a opera or classical music concert or a play. It’s less common, for example, at a rock concert. In fact, I don’t think anyone says “bravo” at a rock concert; it’s much too formal of a word. You could also use it in other circumstances. Someone performs well on a test, for example, you might say, “Bravo! Good job!”
Javier says, “There’s no need for a standing ovation and stop gushing.” A “standing ovation” (ovation) is when the people watching the performance or listening to it, the audience members, all stand up and they clap and shout loudly to show how much they liked the performance. So, it’s when everyone stands and claps. That’s a standing ovation. Sometimes informally it’s called a “standing ‘O’,” “o” for “ovation.” He says to Claudia, “stop gushing.” “To gush” (gush) is to express your praise or appreciation or enjoyment of something, but too much, to talk about something that you like too much. “She was gushing over her new boyfriend, and I couldn’t stand listening to her anymore. So I went outside and put my head under water so I could not hear her anymore.” True story!
Javier says, “The performers did a passable job.” To say something is “passable” means it was okay, it met the minimum requirements; it was acceptable, but it wasn’t great. He says, “It was nothing to write home about.” This is a popular expression. When someone says, “it is nothing to write home about” they mean it wasn’t very good. You shouldn’t spend time thinking about it; it wasn’t very interesting, it wasn’t very special or unusual. “How was the restaurant?” “Well, it was nothing to write home about.” It wasn’t very good; it was okay.
Claudia says to Javier, “You’re so jaded (jaded).” “Jaded” is someone who is bored or perhaps uninterested in something because they have had too much experience to become excited by it. They’ve seen, perhaps, too many performances like that. Someone who is jaded is someone who, perhaps, has been doing something for a long time and no longer can react appropriately, no longer can become excited or sad even about something. Claudia says, “That performance was genius.” “Genius” usually means very intelligent. Dr. Lucy Tse is a genius. But here, it means it was excellent, it was very good. If it’s used to describe a performance, that’s it’s meaning. Claudia says, “It took my breath away.” To take (one’s) breath away” is an expression that means that you saw something or heard something very beautiful, very wonderful, something that surprised you because it was so good. It is as though you had stopped breathing because you were so interested in the performance. There was also a song – written, I don’t know when. Back in the 80s? [Jeff sings] Take my breath away. Doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo. Remember that? I think it was in a movie. Maybe a Tom Cruise movie, Top Gunperhaps? But anyway, that movie, uh, did not take my breath away!
Javier says, “I thought the first number was okay.” In a performance, a “number” is one part of a larger program – a larger performance, such as one song or one dance. “Number” tends to be associated with song and dance mostly. Javier says, “none of the dancers embarrassed themselves, but that’s all I can say about it.” “To embarrass yourself” means to do something that you are not happy with later on, to make a fool of yourself, to do something that you would prefer no one else saw because it wasn’t very good. Javier says the dancers did not embarrass themselves, but he can’t say they did a good job either.
Claudia says, “I’m sure they’d thank you for that faint praise.” “Faint” (faint) means not very strong. “Praise” is when you tell someone how much you like something or enjoy something. “Faint praise” is when you compliment someone, you say something nice to them, but really it’s sort of a criticism. For example, you say to your son or daughter who got a B-plus on their test (the highest score would be an A), you say, “Oh, that B-plus, that’s almost as good as an A. Congratulations.” You see you’re complimenting them, you’re praising them, but really you’re criticizing them. That’s what faint praise is, and that is what Javier is doing in describing the dancers.
Claudia says, “Me? I’ve never seen anything better.” Javier says, “how can you say that? That’s just over the top.” Something that is “over the top” is something that is excessive, when you have too much of something. Let’s say, for example, your girlfriend does something wrong and she wants to apologize for it. It wasn’t anything serious, but she wants to say that she’s sorry. That will never happened, usually! But let’s say that it does, and she comes in and she starts crying, and she falls down on the floor acting as though her life was basically over. That would be over the top, that would be doing too much to say you’re sorry.
Claudia says that if I can’t be effusive, who can? “Effusive” (effusive) means to express your feelings, your thoughts, your emotions with a lot of excitement, a lot of enthusiasm. Claudia says, “How many times will we see our granddaughter in a school play?” Now we know what is going on here. Claudia and Javier have a granddaughter – their son or daughter has a child – and they are watching the child perform at a play at the child’s school. Many American schools often put on plays once or twice a year, performances or plays for the parents and grandparents.
Javier says, “She’s seven years old and she played a tomato!” We use the verb “played” in a play at the theater to describe the character that the person was supposed to be. For example, Tobey Maguire the actor played Spiderman in the movie Spiderman. Or, I played Chewbacca in the movie Star Wars – true story!
Javier says that their granddaughter played a tomato. Sometimes, you know, with children’s plays, they’re often a little silly and the children dress up like vegetables, apparently. I don’t know! Claudia then says, “Yes, but don’t forget: she played the lead tomato!” When you say someone in a play or movie “played the lead” you mean that was the main role in the show or performance. Usually it’s the best actor or the best artist that plays the lead in a performance. So, Claudia and Javier’s granddaughter played the lead tomato, the most important one. Of course, that’s a little silly – a little crazy. “Lead” has several other meanings in English, as does the word “number” that we mentioned earlier. Those can be found in the Learning Guide, of course.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

What Else Does It Mean?
number
The word “number,” in this podcast, means one part of a longer performance, such as one song, one dance, or one act: “Should we start the performance with our best number, or save it for the end?” A “number cruncher” is an accountant or someone else who works with numbers and makes many calculations: “If you don’t like math, why did you decide to become a number cruncher?” The phrase “to be good (bad) with numbers” means to (not) understand math and (not) be able to make calculations: “He’s bad with numbers, so he prefers to study history and literature.” As an adjective, “numb” means without feeling: “The dentist gave her a shot that made the right side of her mouth numb so she wouldn’t feel anything as he worked on her teeth.”
lead
In this podcast, the word “lead” means the main role in a show or performance, usually given to the best artist or musician: “Marcello is a very talented actor who always gets the lead roles in school plays.” The “lead musician” is the main or most important musician in a group: “Who is the lead guitar player for Led Zepplin?” The phrase “to be in the lead” means to be winning in a race or competition: “Which horse is in the lead right now?” Finally, the phrase “to take the lead” means to become very active and involved in a project or activity, showing or telling other people what to do: “When Mathieu took the lead and made the project a success, he earned a promotion at work.”
Culture Note
When an audience enjoys a performance, it has many ways to “express” (show) its appreciation. Depending on the type of performance, it can be “rude” (not polite) or inappropriate to show appreciation during the performance, but it is usually “acceptable” (okay; allowed) to express appreciation between songs or “acts” (parts of a play) and it is always acceptable at the end of a performance.
When a show or performance is over, the audience “applauds” (claps; hits hands together rhythmically to make a noise). The performers, especially actors, come up for a “curtain call,” when they all stand on the stage in front of the audience. If it is an informal performance, audience members may shout “woo-hoo” or similar noises to “indicate” (show) that they liked what they have seen or heard. At more formal performances, audience members are more likely to shout “bravo.”
If audiences really like a musical performance, they might shout “encore,” meaning that they would like to hear more. Most bands or orchestras have an extra song or two that they have prepared for this purpose, so if the “conductor” (the person who leads an orchestra) hears enough audience members shouting “encore,” he or she will have the orchestra play another song or two.
Often people will bring flowers for a “soloist” (a person who performs alone for a period of time as part of a larger show or performance). The flowers are often brought to the soloist by the “director” or “producer” (the people who create the show).
Family members and close friends sometimes “go backstage” (go behind the stage, where performers change clothes) after a performance to “congratulate” (tell someone that he or she has done well) the performers, and these people often bring flowers, too.
