Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 1,280 – Describing Poor Audio Quality.
This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 1,280. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.
This episode is a dialogue between Young and Silvia about listening to something that is not recorded very well – that has poor audio quality. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Young: We have a major problem. The audio on the new presentation is really awful.
Silvia: Really? Let me listen to it. Oh, the volume fluctuates and keeps cutting out. We even have long periods of dead air!
Young: That’s only one of the many problems. Keep listening and you’ll hear lots of static in the background. Sometimes it’s so loud that it drowns out all other sounds.
Silvia: Oh no, the voices are distorted, too. Some speakers sound garbled and others sound muffled.
Young: And when you can make out what the speakers are saying, their voices are tinny.
Silvia: What are we going to do?
Young: I guess we can try to remaster it and see if we can make any improvements.
Silvia: What if we can’t?
Young: Worse comes to worst? We’ll use captions!
[end of dialogue]
Young begins our dialogue by saying to Silvia, “We have a major problem.” “Major” (major) means a big or important problem. Young says, “The audio on the new presentation is really awful” – is really bad, or terrible. “Audio” (audio) is sound that you hear that is recorded or copied. Usually it is recorded on some sort of electronic device. Most movies have “video” (video) as well as “audio.” “Video” is what you can see, what is recorded visually. “Audio” is what you can hear.
A “presentation” (presentation) is usually some information that is given to someone that includes both sound and visual information. A presentation at your office, where you work, might be someone standing up in front of you and talking about information, giving you information and showing you things. That’s a “presentation.” “The audio on the new presentation,” according to Young, “is really awful.” Silvia says, “Really?” She’s surprised. She then says, “Let me listen to it.” “Oh,” she says, “the volume fluctuates and keeps cutting out.” The “volume” (volume) of something is how loud it is. It is a measure of how much sound is being produced, we could say.
We talk about a “high volume” and a “low volume.” Something that is on “low volume” is not very loud. If you want to increase the volume, we would use the phrasal verb “turn it up” or “turn up the volume.” “To turn up the volume” means to increase the volume, to make something louder. The opposite would be “to turn down (down) the volume.” Here, the volume “fluctuates” (fluctuates). “To fluctuate” means to vary – to increase and then decrease, but not in a constant or steady way, to go up and down unpredictably.
The phrasal verb “to cut (cut) out” can mean simply to stop, but here it means for the sound to stop temporarily and then to begin again. If someone says the audio is “cutting out,” he means you can hear it and then suddenly you can’t hear it, and then you can hear it again. You know, what happens sometimes when you are listening to your music through your headphones or your earbuds on your phone, and suddenly you can’t hear the music, and then you can hear the music. That’s usually because you have a bad connection, perhaps. The wire is bad. That’s what we mean by audio “cutting out.”
Silvia says, “We even have long periods,” or long amounts of time, “of dead (dead) air (air).” “Dead air” is usually a phrase we associate with television or radio, when there is suddenly no sound. You can’t hear anything. That is usually because there is some technical problem at the radio station. Well, in this presentation, which was recorded electronically, there are times when there is dead air – and that of course is not good.
Young says, “That’s only one of the many problems. Keep listening and you’ll hear lots of static in the background.” “Static” (static) is noise in a recording that you don’t want there. Here’s an example of static that, if you’re old enough to remember, you might have heard on what we used to call a “record player,” something that played old vinyl albums. Listen. [static] That’s an example of static. There is static, Young says, “in the background” (background).
The “background” is what you hear in addition to the person talking on the audio. It’s the other noise in the room, or other noise that is present in addition to the person talking, or perhaps the music that is being played. Young says, “Sometimes it” – meaning the static – “is so loud that it drowns out the other sounds.” “To drown (drown) out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning for the noise or the sound to be louder than something else so that you can’t hear what you want to hear.
If I’m talking to you and suddenly there’s a big motorcycle that drives by and makes a lot of noise, if that noise is very loud, it might drown me out. You won’t be able to hear me because the noise of the motorcycle is too loud. My neighbor likes to sing to himself sometimes, very loudly, and that sometimes drowns out my television that I am listening to, so I have to turn my television volume up, and then he sings louder, and then I turn my television up even louder. You get the idea.
Silvia says, “Oh no, the voices are distorted, too.” “To be distorted” (distorted) means to be difficult to hear or to understand, usually because there is some problem with the recording or because the device you are listening to has a problem. A voice that is “distorted” might be one that is suddenly very high or very low. This would be an example of a distorted voice. That’s really bad distortion. I apologize for that.
Silvia continues, “Some speakers,” meaning some of the people who are talking, “sound garbled and others sound muffled.” If someone sounds “garbled” (garbled), he is difficult to understand. It’s similar to “distorted.” “Muffled” (muffled) is when sound is not loud enough, perhaps because someone is covering the microphone or someone is not speaking very clearly. Young says, “And when you can make out what the speakers are saying, their voices are tinny.”
“To make (make) out what someone is saying” means to be able to understand what the other person is saying. We also use this phrasal verb when we are trying to read something that is very difficult because it isn’t written very clearly – maybe it was written with a pencil and it’s hard to read. “I can’t make out what this says.” I can’t understand it. Young also complains that some of the people in the recording have voices that sound “tinny” (tinny). If you have a “tinny” voice, it’s very high-pitched or difficult to understand. Well, that’s even more than tinny.
Silvia then says, “What are we going to do?” Young says, “I guess we can try to remaster it and see if we can make any improvements.” “To remaster” (remaster) is to use technology to improve the quality of sound that was recorded before, or often many years ago. Sometimes movie studios here in Los Angeles, movie companies, will “remaster” old movies, trying to improve the sound and the way they look. We usually use this term, however, to refer to improving the audio quality of something.
Silvia asks, “What if we can’t?” meaning what if we cannot remaster the audio to make it sound better. Young says, “Worse comes to worst? We’ll use captions.” The expression “worse (worse) comes to worst (worst)” is used to mean or describe a bad situation that gets even worse, that becomes as bad as possible. Young says in the worst situation, “We’ll use captions” (captions). “Captions” are when you have the words to what you are watching on the screen.
Captions are used in television and sometimes in movies when a person is difficult to understand, and so you put the words of what that person is saying on the bottom of the screen so that you can read them as well as listen to them. Watching programs, television shows, that are “captioned” in the language of the show – that is, not translated, but actually the same words that are being spoken by the person on the show or in the movie – is actually a very good way of improving your English. There’s some good scientific research about that.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

What Else Does It Mean?
static
The word “static,” in this podcast, means unintended (not planned) hissing or crackling noises heard in recorded audio messages or a phone call: “Do you think static from outer space could actually be messages from other forms of life?” The word “static” also means not moving or changing: “These web pages are static, meaning they never update.” Or, “It’s not realistic to think that housing prices will remain static.” Finally, the phrase “static electricity” describes the electrical charge that builds up on a surface and can produce an unpleasant shock when touched: “Rubbing a balloon on your hair can generate enough static electricity to make the balloon stick to a wall.” Or, “If you walk around on wool carpet, it creates enough static electricity that you can get shocked if you touch a piece of metal.”
tinny
In this podcast, the word “tinny” means having a high-pitched, unpleasant, metal-like sound: “The poor quality strings on the violin make is sound tinny.” Normally “tin” is a soft, silver-colored metal: “Have you considered installing a tin roof”? Or, “Where can I recycle tin scraps?” A “tin” can also be a metal container with a lid, often use for holding cookies or tea: “Thank you for the tin of Earl Grey tea. It’s delicious.” Or, “They baked holiday cookies and put them in decorative tins to give to the neighbors.” Finally, a “tin can” is a tin or aluminum can, a cylinder with a sealed top and bottom, used to store food for a longer period of time: “I didn’t feel like cooking, so I just heated up some soup from a tin can.”
Culture Note
The Vinyl Revival
The way in which people listen to music has changed “dramatically” (in major ways) over the past few decades (10-year periods, such as the 1960s, 1970s, etc.). Beginning in the late 1940s, people were listening to “pop music” (popular music) on “vinyl records,” or a disc of flat, normally black plastic with many “grooves” (small carved areas) that a record player “needle” (the pointed part of a record player) rested in to produce recorded sounds. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, vinyl records “gave way to” (became less common or popular as something else became more common or popular) to “4-tracks” and “cassette tapes” where music was recorded on long tapes that required rolling forward or backward to find a particular song. “Compact discs,” or “CDs” became popular in the 1980s, but then they gave way to “MP3s” (digital sound) and “streaming audio” (music that is heard while it is played on the Internet).
Usually, the old “audio format” (a way of listening to recorded sound) “fades away” (begins to disappear) as buyers begin to like and use new technologies. But beginning in the early 2000s, there was a “vinyl revival” in which people began “bringing back” (using again) vinyl records. There is a “resurgence” (an increase back to previous levels) of the popularity of vinyl, especially among “Millennials” (young people; the generation of people who became adults around 2000), who do not even remember the time when records first “came out” (became available for consumers to buy).
Vinyl records “represent” (make up) only a small “portion” (part; fraction or percentage) of all music sales, but “fans” (people who enthusiastically like something) “rave” (say good things) about the “tactile quality” (the ability for something to be touched and felt) of vinyl records.
