This episode is a dialogue between Eliana and Matt about dating a possessive person. Let's get started.
[start of dialogue]
Eliana: You’re here! I didn’t think you’d be able to come.
Matt: Why? I like seeing a movie with my friends as much as the next guy.
Eliana: Yeah, but it’s been weeks since we’ve seen you, ever since you started dating Helen.
Matt: She doesn’t own me. She’s a little possessive, but I put my foot down when she gets too clingy.
Eliana: Doesn’t she get jealous if you so much as look at another woman?
Matt: She’s the jealous type, that’s true, but I reassure her all the time that she’s the only one I want. It’s true that she’s critical of other women, too, but what woman isn’t? She’s fine if she knows where I am and whom I’m with.
Eliana: You mean you have to report in to her on your whereabouts?
Matt: She likes to know what I’m doing. She’s just concerned about me, that’s all.
Eliana: She seems really controlling.
Matt: What did you say?
Eliana: Nothing. I see Xavier and Sophie over there. Ready to get our tickets?
Matt: Hold on one second. I just need to text Helen an update. If she doesn’t hear from me every half hour, she worries. Isn’t that sweet?
[end of dialogue]
This episode is all about “dating” (dating). “To date” means to see someone romantically – to have a boyfriend or girlfriend. This is done before you get married. Once you get married, we don't talk about dating. We don't talk about anything, really, once you get married . . . no, I'm just kidding. “Dating” is seeing someone you are romantically interested in.
Eliana begins by saying to Matt, “You’re here! I didn't think you'd be able to come” – I didn't think you'd be able to come to wherever Eliana is. Matt says, “Why? I like seeing a movie with my friends as much as the next guy.” So, now we learn that Matt and Eliana are apparently outside of or inside of a movie theater, and that they are friends. You see how much we can learn in just a few words.
Matt says he likes seeing a movie as much as the next guy. That expression, “as much as the next guy,” means “just like other people.” It's a phrase we use to emphasize that what you do, or what you like to do, is normal. It's what everyone else does as well. Eliana says, “Yeah, but it's been weeks since we've seen you, ever since you started dating Helen.” Now we learn that Matt is dating a girl by the name of Helen.
Matt says, “She doesn't own me.” When someone says, “She doesn't own me,” he's probably lying, but he means, “That person doesn't control me.” My girlfriend doesn't control me. She doesn't tell me what I have to do. I don't listen to what she says. Again, this is completely imaginary. This would never actually happen in the real world. But Matt is saying that his girlfriend doesn't own him.
He says, “She's a little possessive.” “To be possessive” (possessive) means to want to have something only for yourself. You don't want to share it with anyone else. “To be possessive” means to want to have something and not have anyone else have it. If you are possessive of another person, you may not like that other person talking to friends or family members instead of you.
That is sometimes a problem. In fact, it's usually a problem if a person is very possessive, what we might describe as “overly possessive.” Of course, you have to be possessive at some level – to some extent, a little bit – about a person that you love. You want them to spend time with you more than they spend time with other people.
Matt says, “I put my foot down when she gets too clingy.” The expression “to put your foot (foot) down” means to be very assertive, to clearly indicate what you are willing to do or not willing to do. You might say, for example, “If I see anyone not doing their work, I'm going to put my foot down and tell you to go home and take all your stuff with you. You’re fired.” “I’m going to put my foot down” – I'm going to be very strong and assertive. I’m going to say, “This is the law, this is the rule, and if you don't follow it, you are out.”
Matt is saying that he's putting his foot down. He's being strong and assertive with his girlfriend whenever she gets too clingy. The adjective “clingy” (clingy) comes from the verb “to cling” (cling). “To cling” is to hold on to something tightly. “To be clingy” is to want to be with another person so much that the other person may get annoyed or bothered; the other person may not like you being that close to them or wanting to be close to them all the time.
Eliana says, “Doesn't she get jealous if you so much as look at another woman?” “Jealous” (jealous) is when you have negative feelings of suspicion. You think another person is not being faithful to you or loyal to you. If a woman sees her husband talking to another beautiful woman, she might get upset. She might be jealous. She may want the husband to come back and stop talking to the beautiful woman. The wife may think that her husband is perhaps interested romantically in this other woman, and therefore doesn't want him talking to her. That might be actually true. So, you know, sometimes being jealous is a good thing.
However, here Eliana says that Matt's girlfriend, Helen, gets jealous if Matt so much as looks at another woman. When we use the expression “so much as,” we mean – especially when referring to, usually, referring to something that doesn't seem very important – that it’s a very small action that shouldn't cause the person to get angry. If a mother says to her children, “Don't eat this cake. If you so much as take one piece, I'm going to send you to your rooms without dinner” – you won't get to eat tonight.
Kind of a mean mom, but you understand what she's saying. She doesn't want the children taking the cake. If they eat so much as one piece – even if they only eat one piece – she will punish them. She will send them to their room without their dinner. Probably not a good idea, but it certainly does happen.
Matt says, “She’s the jealous type,” meaning she's the kind of person who gets jealous. Matt continues, “I reassure her all the time that she's the only one I want.” “To reassure” (reassure) means to say something to someone to make them feel more confident or comfortable about a situation that they have doubts about. You’re trying to say to the other person, “Don't worry. Everything 's okay. What I am telling you is true.” Matt tries to reassure Helen that Helen is the only one that Matt wants.
Matt says, “It's true that she's critical of other women, too, but what woman isn't?” “To be critical” (critical) means to say negative things about another person – to find errors, faults, or problems with what another person does or how another person acts or behaves. The verb is “to criticize.” Matt says his girlfriend is critical of other women, “but what woman isn't?” meaning all women are critical of other women. I guess that's what he’s saying. I'm not saying that. Please don't email me and complain. Email Matt.
Matt continues, “She's fine if she knows where I am and whom I'm with.” The girlfriend doesn't get jealous if she knows where Matt is all the time, or at least she doesn't worry as much. Eliana says, “You mean you have to report in to her on your whereabouts?” “To report in” means to contact someone and tell them what you are doing, usually so that person can monitor your progress. It's something you would do if you’re an employee with your boss. You might report in if you are traveling somewhere for your company, to tell your boss what you were doing. The idea of reporting in has with it the notion that the person you are reporting in to somehow has authority or control over you.
“Whereabouts” (whereabouts) is where you are. “Whereabouts” is all one word. It's where you are located right now. The police often use this word in trying to find a person who is missing or who has perhaps committed a crime, has broken the law. “We don't know the whereabouts of this person” – we don't know where this person is. Matt says his girlfriend likes to know what he's doing. “She's just concerned about me, that's all,” Matt says.
Eliana says, “She seems really controlling.” “To be controlling” means to want to make all of the decisions for another person, to want to decide what the other person is going to do – to be in charge of another person. That's to be controlling. It's almost always considered a negative thing. Matt says, “What did you say?” Eliana says, “Nothing.” Matt didn't hear exactly what Eliana was saying, or perhaps he didn't like what she was saying.
Sometimes, if you don't like what someone has said, especially if they are insulting you or saying something critical about you or someone you love, you might pretend as though you didn't hear them: “Excuse me, what did you say?” You’re basically telling the person to repeat what they said because you want to make sure that you heard it correctly, usually because it was something you didn't like.
Eliana, however, doesn't repeat what she says. Instead, she changes the subject. She decides to stop talking about this issue. She says, “I see Xavier and Sophie over there. Ready to get our tickets?” Matt says, “Hold on one second,” meaning wait just a few seconds. “I just need to text Helen an update.” “To text” someone means to send them a message, usually with your phone. An “update” (update) is the most recent information about something, the latest news about something.
Matt says if his girlfriend doesn't hear from him – doesn't receive some sort of message from him – every half hour, every 30 minutes, she worries. “Isn't that sweet?” “Sweet” (sweet) here means kind or caring or considerate. Matt thinks it’s sweet that his girlfriend wants him to give her updates every 30 minutes about what he's doing. He thinks it's a nice thing. It shows that she loves him, which she probably does. But it sounds as though she might be a little possessive.
Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Matt: Why? I like seeing a movie with my friends as much as the next guy.

Culture Note
No-Fault Divorces
In the past, Americans who wanted to get a “divorce” (the legal end of a marriage) had to “prove” (demonstrate; show) “wrongdoing” (bad behavior) by one of the two people in the marriage. This created an “adversarial” (as enemies; not friendly) relationship between the two people who wanted to get a divorce and further “soured” (made unpleasant and bad) an already bad situation. For example, a husband or wife might have to prove that the “spouse” (husband or wife) had been “unfaithful” (involved in a sexual relationship with someone else). However, if that spouse replied that the other person had also been unfaithful, the court could “find” (legally conclude) that both parties had engaged in wrongdoing, and therefore not “grant” (allow) the divorce.
Beginning in 1970, U.S. states began to pass laws that “provided for” (allowed) “no-fault divorces” in which there was no requirement to prove wrongdoing. Today, all 50 states “have provisions for” (allow) no-fault divorces. This makes it easier for spouses to get a divorce, because they can state that they no longer want to be married, without “blaming” (being mad at and identifying as the source of a problem) the spouse.
In some cases, spouses can “claim” (state as a reason) “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for their divorce. “Irreconcilable differences” are things on which the spouses cannot agree, or differences that make them “incompatible” (not able to continue living with each other as husband and wife). Irreconcilable differences would be things that at least one spouse is unable or unwilling to change in order to “save the marriage” (avoid divorce).
