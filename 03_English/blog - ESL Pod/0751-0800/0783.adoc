This episode is a dialogue between Carla and Adam talking about everyone’s favorite subject, politics. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Carla: Our government should do more to help people who can’t find jobs.
Adam: Be careful. You’re starting to sound like a socialist. Haven’t you always said that you’re a staunch capitalist?
Carla: Of course, I’m a capitalist, but that doesn’t mean I think the government should be completely hands-off. We pay taxes and the government has a responsibility to take care of its citizens.
Adam: Ooo, now you’re sounding like a communist. Next thing I know, you’ll be calling for a revolution.
Carla: I’m serious. I think the government should help people find jobs and pay for their living expenses until they get back on their feet.
Adam: Okay, but in a capitalistic society, you’re subject to market forces. If people aren’t buying, businesses aren’t producing or providing services. That puts people out of work. Do you think the government should intervene?
Carla: I just think the government should do more, that’s all.
Adam: Okay, but that would mean higher taxes.
Carla: Yes, we should tax the rich, the more the better.
Adam: Aren’t you among the top 10 percent of income earners?
Carla: I mean they should tax the one percent!
Adam: Pass the buck, you mean.
Carla: No, I mean we need better distribution of wealth. Are you with me or against me?
Adam: That depends on when you’re planning to start the revolution, comrade.

Carla begins our dialogue by saying to Adam, “Our government should do more to help people who can’t find jobs (who can’t find work).” Adam says, “Be careful. You’re starting to sound like a socialist.” A “socialist” is someone who believes in “socialism,” the political philosophy that the government should own and run a large number of the businesses in a society, or should basically be in charge of the economy to a greater extent. A “capitalist” would be someone who believed that the businesses should be owned by individuals and not be interfered with by the government. Those, of course, are very broad differences, but I think you get the idea.
Adam says, “Haven’t you always said that you’re a staunch capitalist?” He’s asking Carla. Carla says, “Of course, I’m a capitalist, but that doesn’t mean I think the government should be completely hands-off.” “To be hands-off” means not to be involved. Carla is saying the government should be involved in the economy somehow, in this case to help people who don’t have jobs. Carla says, “We pay taxes and the government has a responsibility to take care of its citizens.” “Taxes,” you probably know, is money that you pay to the government, either when you buy something or when you make money at your job. Carla says, “the government has a responsibility to take care of (to watch over) its citizens.” “Citizens” are people who belong to a certain country. I’m a citizen of the United States; I have a United States passport.
Well, Adam says, “Ooo, now you’re sounding like a communist.” A “communist” would be a person who believes the government should basically run the entire economy, that everything should be in the hands of the government. A socialist would not want the government to own all of the means of production; they would not want the government to control everything. A communist, however, would want the government to be in charge of the entire economy. Once again, I know that’s not a perfect description, but it’s the general idea when we’re talking about the economic aspects of these different philosophies.
Adam says, “Next thing I know, you’ll be calling for a revolution.” The expression “next thing I know” is used to predict what might happen in the future, but usually when we say this you’re kind of joking, you’re being sarcastic. “Next thing I know, you’ll be calling for a revolution.” Adam doesn’t really think Carla will be calling for or asking for or demanding a revolution. A “revolution” is when, usually, you take over the government in order to change the government, often by using violence.
But Carla doesn’t want to joke the way Adam does. She says, “I’m serious. I think the government should help people find jobs and pay for their living expenses until they get back on their feet.” “To get back on your feet” means to become independent again, especially when we are talking about money, you are able to pay your own rent and buy your own food. We use this expression when someone has had some problems, some difficulties. Maybe they can’t afford to buy food or can’t pay their rent, so someone else helps them until they get back on their feet, until they can be independent again. That could also happen if you are injured physically.
Adam says, “Okay, but in a capitalistic society, you’re subject to market forces.” “To be subject to (something)” means to be influenced or controlled by something. The “market” refers to people buying and selling things, in general. “Market forces” would be a general description of the buying and the selling, what we would call “the laws of supply and demand,” where prices are determined by how much people want something and how much of that something there is. Adam says, “If people aren’t buying (people aren’t purchasing), businesses aren’t producing or providing services. That puts people out of work.” “To put (someone) out of work” means to make people lose their job, to do something that causes people to lose their job. Adam says, “Do you think the government should intervene?” “To intervene” (intervene) means to become involved in something, usually to try to change that something, to change the results. So, if the government intervenes in the economy, they do something to change the way the economy is working.
Carla says, “I just think the government should do more, that’s all.” She doesn’t have a specific idea; she just thinks the government should do something. Adam says, “Okay, but that would mean higher taxes,” meaning if the government got involved people would have to pay more money to the government. Carla says, “Yes, we should tax the rich, the more the better.” We should make rich people pay more money – pay more taxes. She says, “the more the better,” meaning the more money they pay the better things will be.
Adam says, “Aren’t you among the top 10 percent of income earners?” “Income” is money that you receive from either working or from investing your money. “Earners” are people who work and get paid for their work. So, it’s a little redundant, you could just say “earners,” but Adam says “income earners.” He’s saying that Carla is in the top 10 percent of people in the country in terms of how much money she makes. So she’s pretty, or fairly rich.
Carla says, “I mean the government should tax the one percent!” She’s saying no, no, they shouldn’t tax me, but they should tax people who have more money than I do, not the top 10 percent, but the top 1 percent. Adam says, “Pass the buck, you mean.” The phrase “to pass the buck” (buck) means to try to make someone else responsible for your actions, especially if you do something wrong, to try to blame someone else. Here, I think, Adam means more generally to have other people pay for the things that you want.
Carla says, “No, I mean we need better distribution of wealth.” “To distribute” means to give things to different people. “Wealth” is, in this case, money. So, the “distribution of wealth” is who has the money in a certain society, in a certain country. There’s another expression, “redistribution of wealth,” which means taking money from some people, usually rich people, and giving it to people who have less money. Carla says, “Are you with me or against me?” “To be with (someone)” here would mean to agree with them, to support their position. “To be against (someone)” would be to disagree. Carla is asking whether Adam agrees or disagrees with her, whether Adam will support her or not. “Are you with me or against me?”
Adam, again making a joke, says, “That depends on when you’re planning to start the revolution, comrade.” “Comrade” (comrade) means friend, but it was used traditionally to talk to fellow citizens in a communist country – in a communist society. So once again, Adam is saying that Carla is like a communist because she wants the government to raise taxes on the rich to help the poor.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

I totally forgot that they were going through a divorce.”

Culture Note
Common Terms Used When Talking About Capitalism
Capitalists believe most businesses should be owned by individuals and government interference should be “minimized” (made as little or small as possible) because market forces will regulate economic transactions.
Capitalists promote “laissez faire” policies, which is the idea that government should let the economy develop naturally, without very much (or any) influence. “In practice” (in reality), most people recognize that the government needs to have at least some level of involvement, such as providing “social welfare programs” (assistance for low-income people) and “safety nets” (programs that help people who have no other options, especially after losing a job or becoming disabled).
“Free enterprise” is a concept that is similar to laissez faire, in that it means letting private businesses operate “freely” (without controls or restrictions) without being controlled by the government. Some “extremists” (people with very extreme beliefs) believe truly free enterprise is possible only “in the absence of” (without) taxes and regulations.
Capitalists believe in power of the “market economy,” or an economic system where businesses decide how much of a good or service they will provide and at what price they will sell it, and individuals decide how much of a good or service they will “consume” (buy and use) at a given price. The market economy works, because each business wants to “engage in actions” (do things) that will maximize its “profitability” (all money received minus all expenses).
Economists talk about the “invisible hand” that guides the market to the appropriate price for a given good or service depending on “supply” (how much of something is available for sale) and “demand” (how much of something people want to buy).
