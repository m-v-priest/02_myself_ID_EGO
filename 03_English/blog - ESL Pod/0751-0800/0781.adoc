This episode is about making a television show or movie. Sounds exciting! Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Martin: Okay, quiet on the set! What are the extras doing over there? They’re not in the scene.
Stephanie: Sorry, I’ll get them off the set. Is this the lighting you wanted for this scene? If not, I can tell the lighting crew.
Martin: The lighting is fine, but this staging is all wrong. And can somebody turn off those sound effects? We’re not using them in this scene.
Stephanie: I’ll get right on that.
Martin: Where is the cast?
Stephanie: They’re on break because they thought we wouldn’t resume shooting until 2:00.
Martin: That’s great! I have no cast, the sets are all wrong, I have extras milling around where they shouldn’t be, and where is my script?
Stephanie: It’s right here on your chair. Are you sure you don’t want to call it a day and start again in the morning?
Martin: I wish I had that luxury. Time is money and we’re already way over budget. I’ll be lucky if I still have the shirt on my back when this production is over!
[end of dialogue]
Our dialogue begins with Martin saying, “Okay, quiet on the set!” The “set” (set) is the area where you are making a video or a film or a television show; it’s the area where the actors are standing, what you’re actually filming. “Quiet on the set” is a common expression the “director” of the film or the TV show, the person who is in charge of actually making it, says so that everyone is quiet when they start filming so that you don’t hear other people talking when you’re not supposed to.
Martin says, “What are the extras doing over there?” An “extra” (extra) is a person who appears in a movie or a TV show, but doesn’t say anything usually, doesn’t have any what we would call “speaking parts.” They don’t actually say anything; they’re just there perhaps as part of a crowd of people. Here in Los Angeles, there are lots of companies that have extras, and you can sign up and work as an extra in a movie. It’s very boring work, I’ve been told, and it doesn’t pay very well. I know a few people who have done that because they needed the money. Well, a lot of actors try to get their “start,” their beginning in acting, by being an extra, one of these people that just appear on the screen – that is, in the movie or in the TV show – even though they don’t say anything and you don’t even know who they are.
Martin says that the extras are not in the scene. The “scene” (scene) is the part of the movie – it could also be talking about a play – that shows action in a single place. So, a movie usually has several different scenes – several different places that you see the actors and the actresses. There are a few movies that don’t have more than one or two scenes. There was a famous movie several years ago called My Dinner with Andre, where the whole movie was just basically two people talking in a restaurant. Well, most movies have several scenes.
Stephanie says, “Sorry, I’ll get them (I’ll get the extras) off the set,” meaning so that they are no longer where the cameras are filming. She says, “Is this the lighting you wanted for this scene? If not, I can tell the lighting crew.” The “lighting” is the arrangement of the lights on a stage or on a set that allows you, of course, to see the actors. Especially if you are inside, you need to be able to have lighting so that you can see what’s going on. The word “crew” (crew) is a general term for a group of people who are working together, usually doing some sort of physical work. In a movie or a TV show, a “crew” is a group of people who do all of the technical things, not the actors, not the director, but the people who do the lighting, who actually operate the cameras, and so forth. This is the crew.
Martin says, “The lighting is fine, but this staging is all wrong.” “Staging” (staging) is the plan for where the actors are going to stand, how they should move around in a particular scene. By the way, I should mention the word “crew,” which we just talked about, has some additional meanings as well; those can be found in our Learning Guide. Martin says, “can someone turn off those sound effects?” “Sound effects” are recorded sounds that are added so that you don’t actually have to have a certain thing there. For example, when we record one of our podcasts and you hear a telephone ringing at the beginning of the dialogue, that’s a sound effect. I don’t actually have a telephone here that I make ring; I have a recording of a telephone and I use that. That’s a sound effect. Martin says that they’re not using sound effects in this scene – in this part of the movie.
Stephanie says, “I’ll get right on that.” “To get right on (something)” means to do it immediately, to do it right away. Martin then says, “Where is the cast?” The “cast” (cast) is the group of actors in the movie, everyone who is supposed to be in the movie or in the television show. They are the people who are the main actors, not the extras. Typically, we talk about the cast, we’re talking about the people who are actually speaking in the movies. Unless, of course, it’s a silent movie!
Stephanie says the cast is “on break,” they’re taking some time to relax, “because they thought we wouldn’t resume shooting until 2:00.” “To shoot” (shoot) here means to use a camera to record images, to record something with a camera, usually a movie camera. Sometimes we’ll talk about a shoot related to taking photographs, especially, for example, for a magazine. If they are models, we might have a shoot. But here, we’re talking about filming the TV show or the movie.
Martin says, “That’s great!” But he is not happy when he says, “That’s great,” he’s being sarcastic; he’s saying one thing and meaning another. He says, “I have no cast, the sets are all wrong, I have extras milling around where they shouldn’t be, and where is my script?” Martin says he has extras milling around. “To mill (mill) around” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to sort of walk around slowly in an area without any reason or without any particular purpose. You’re just waiting for something so you’re sort of standing, we might say “standing around,” milling around, moving back and forth because you don’t have anything else to do. Martin asks where his script is. The “script” (script) is the written plan for the play, the TV show, or the movie that tells you what all the actors say and what they do.
Stephanie says, “It’s right here on your chair. Are you sure you don’t want to call it a day and start again in the morning?” “To call it a day” means to stop doing something, to stop working for that day and not to work again until the next day. So maybe you’ve been working very hard in your office, and at 4:00 in the afternoon you say, “I’m going to call it a day.” I’m going to stop working now and resume or continue working tomorrow.
Martin says, “I wish I had that luxury,” the luxury to call it a day. “Luxury” (luxury) here means something very nice, something pleasant, something good and pleasurable. But Martin says he does not have that luxury; he cannot afford – he doesn’t have the ability to just stop working for the day. He says, “Time is money.” This is an old expression. “Time is money” means that you can’t waste your time. We have to be productive, if we sit around and do nothing we’ll be losing money because we’re not taking advantage of the time we have.
“Time is money,” Martin says, “and we’re already way over budget.” “To be way over” means to have spent too much money, or to be more than something. In this case, they are over budget. “Budget” (budget) is the plan for the amount of money you are going to spend on something. If you are “over budget,” you’re spending more than you planned. If you are “under budget,” you are spending less than you planned.
Martin says, “I’ll be lucky if I still have the shirt on my back when this production is over!” The expression “the shirt on my back” doesn’t mean the actual shirt you are wearing. It’s a phrase referring to the most that you can lose, the maximum amount of money that you might lose. Of course if you lose all of your money, you may actually lose your clothes; you may have to sell your clothes to pay the money that you owe someone else. That’s kind of what Martin is saying. A “production” (production) is usually the word we use to describe the entire action of making a movie, a play, or a television show. The whole activity – the whole thing is called a “production.”
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Martin: Okay, quiet on the set! What are the extras doing over there? They’re not in this scene.
Stephanie: Sorry, I’ll get them off the set. Is this the lighting you wanted for this scene? If not, I can tell the lighting crew.
Martin: The lighting is fine, but this staging is all wrong. And can somebody turn off those sound effects? We’re not using them in this scene.
Stephanie: I’ll get right on that.

Stephanie: It’s right here on your chair. Are you sure you don’t want to call it a day and start again in the morning?
Martin: I wish I had that luxury. Time is money and we’re already way over budget. I’ll be lucky if I still have the shirt on my back when this production is over!

What Else Does It Mean?
crew
The word “crew,” in this podcast, means a group of people who work together as a team for a particular purpose, especially when that work involves manual (physical) labor: “A film crew is going to come into our office tomorrow to make a promotional video, so please dress nicely and make sure your desk is clean.” Or, “The flight crew is almost done loading fuel onto the plane.” The phrase “crew cut” refers to a very short hairstyle for men: “Jake doesn’t want to become a soldier, because he doesn’t want to lose his long hair when they give him a crew cut.” Finally, a “crew neck” describes a simple, round neckline close to the neck on a shirt or sweater: “That sweater would look better if you wore a crew neck underneath it.”
production
In this podcast, the word “production” means the effort and coordination needed to make a movie, play, or TV show: “That Broadway show was the best production I’ve ever seen of The Phantom of the Opera.” The phrase “to make a big production” means to exaggerate the amount of effort needed to do something and draw attention to one’s actions: “I wish I hadn’t asked Jenna to help with the presentation, because she’s making a big production about how important she is and how I couldn’t do it without her.” Finally, the word “production” refers to manufacturing or growing: “These cows are for milk production, not for meat.” The word “production” can also refer to how much of something is manufactured or grown: “If you give the chickens better food, egg production will increase.”
Culture Note
Filming Locations
Many American movies and TV shows are filmed in Hollywood, but there are a lot of “sites” (locations; places) across the country that are famous because they were used as filming locations in popular movies.
For example, Grand Central Station in New York City is a large “subway” (network of underground tunnels that trains travel through for public transportation) station where there are always many people “commuting” (traveling between home and work). Grand Central Station has been used as a filming location for many movies, including Superman and Armageddon.
Times Square is a very busy intersection in New York City with a lot of electronic “billboards,” large signs used for advertising. Times Square has been a filming location for many movies that need to “depict” (show) a busy city, including Spiderman and Last Action Hero.
The Philadelphia Museum of Art in Pennsylvania is well known as the filming location for Rocky and its “sequels” (movies made later to continue the story in the original movie). In those movies, Rocky the “boxer” (someone who participates in boxing, which is a sport that involves hitting people very hard with special gloves) runs up the stairs at the entrance in the front of the building while he is training for an important “match” (a competition in wrestling or boxing).
Natural areas can also serve as filming locations. The desert scenes in Star Wars were filmed in Death Valley National Park in California. And Field of Dreams was filmed on a “baseball field” (the outdoor area where a baseball game is played) in Dyersville, Iowa.
