This dialogue is between Becky and Saeed; it’s about blowing the whistle. “To blow the whistle” is to tell someone about something that is wrong in your company or organization. If someone is doing something illegal like stealing, to blow the whistle would be to tell your boss or to tell the police. Let’s get started
[start of dialogue]
Becky: What are we going to do?
Saeed: I don’t know. I need time to think about the ramifications of blowing the whistle.
Becky: There are no two ways about it. If we step up and do the right thing, we are putting our jobs on the line.
Saeed: But we can’t keep quiet about this. If it gets out, and we knew about it all along, we’ll get into even more trouble. And plus, think of how many people would be hurt if we kept our mouths shut. Could we live with that?
Becky: Maybe there is a way for us to protect our interests and still do the right thing. Maybe we could be anonymous whistleblowers.
Saeed: Don’t count on being able to remain anonymous. When this thing blows up, we’ll be in knee-deep. There’s only one thing to do.
Becky: What?
Saeed: I have to put my money where my mouth is and go public with what we know. I’ll just have to let the chips fall where they may.
Becky: Don’t be too hasty. Let’s sleep on it and talk about it tomorrow.
Saeed: You can do that if you want to, but I’ve made up my mind. The question is: Are you with me?

Our dialogue begins with Becky saying to Saeed, “What are we going to do?” Saeed says, “I don’t know. I need time to think about the ramifications of blowing the whistle.” “Ramifications” are consequences, implications, something that will happen because you do something, especially when you’re not exactly sure what will happen if you do something: the consequences of your actions. To blow the whistle means to share information about something wrong or bad that someone is doing because you want to stop it; you’re either telling someone in your company – the president or your boss – about something that people are doing wrong, or you’re perhaps telling the government that your company or organization is doing something wrong or illegal.
Becky says, “There are no two ways about it.” This an idiom that means there is no doubt, it’s very clear; this can happen in only one way, there are no different options for us. There’s only one thing we can do, that’s the meaning of there are no two ways about it. She says, “If we step up and do the right thing, we are putting our jobs on the line.” She saying that this is what will happen, there is no other choice for us. “If we step up,” that is, if we volunteer to do or to participate in this action – if we come forward, which is another phrasal verb that means the same thing – if we go to the boss or to the government, “we are putting our jobs on the line.” Something that is “on the line” is something that is at risk, in danger, there’s a possibility that you could lose it. To say your job is on the line means depending on what I do I could lose my job very soon.
Saeed says, “But we can’t keep quiet about this (we can’t not tell anyone). If it gets out, and we knew about it all along, we’ll get into even more trouble.” Notice the very popular word “get” in English; there are all sorts of phrasal verbs – two-word verbs that use the verb “get.” This one is “get out.” “To get out” means for information – secret or private information to become public, to become known by many people. There are other meanings of this expression also, and those are in the Learning Guide.
Saeed says, “If it gets out (if this news about this bad thing is publicized – if people find out about it), we’ll get into even more trouble.” Notice “into,” the preposition, connected with “get.” “To get into trouble” means to be in trouble, to go from not being in trouble to being in trouble. Saeed says, “And plus (meaning in addition), think of how many people would be hurt if we kept our mouths shut.” “To keep your mouth shut” means not to tell anyone, not to say anything to anyone else, to be quiet. This is something I have a great deal of difficulty doing: keeping my mouth shut. My wife tells me this almost every day! Saeed is worried that people will get hurt if they don’t tell someone; he says, “Could we live with that?” “To live with” means to be able to tolerate something. It’s a phrasal verb meaning to put up with something, to be able to continue living your life.
Becky says, “Maybe there is a way for us to protect our interests and still do the right thing.” “To protect your interests” means you are taking care of yourself, you are making sure you don’t get hurt. She wants to protect herself, but she also wants to do the right thing. She says then, “Maybe we could be anonymous whistleblowers.” “To be anonymous” means that no one knows your name, that no one knows who you are. So, you write a note to a girl you like but you don’t put your name on the note; the note is anonymous. I’m not sure why you would do that; it seems kind of stupid to me. You, of course, would want the girl to know your name. But, I suppose maybe you want to provide some mystery about your identity – it’s possible!
Back to the story, Saeed says, “Don’t count on being able to remain anonymous.” “Don’t count on” means don’t rely upon, don’t depend upon, it’s not for certain. Saeed says, “When this thing blows up, we’ll be in knee-deep.” “To blow up” here means to become a major problem, to be a situation that will affect many different people in a bad way. “To blow up” has other meanings in English as a phrasal verb; those are in that Learning Guide we talked about earlier. So, Saeed is saying, “When this thing blows up (when people find out about it and it becomes a big problem), we’ll be in knee-deep.” “To be in knee (knee) -deep” means to be heavily involved in something, you are very much involved in it. Often, it’s a bad thing, but you could also say “I’m knee-deep in work this week,” I have so much work I can barely think, I’m heavily involved in it.
Saeed says, “There’s only one thing to do.” Becky asks, “What?” He says, “I have to put my money where my mouth is and go public with what we know.” This is an expression: “to put your money where your mouth is,” it means to stop talking about something and actually do it; not just to say you’re going to run a marathon, but actually to practice and run the marathon. We use it when someone has finally decided to do something that they’ve been talking about. It also is used sometimes when you give advice to someone, and you need to actually do something as part of that advice: “I’m going to help you find a job.” I promise you something; I’m going to put my money where my mouth is, I’m actually going to call some people to find you a job. “To go public” means to share information with many people, especially the newspapers or the television news programs.
Saeed says, “I’ll just have to let the chips fall where they may.” This expression, “to let the chips (chips) fall where they may,” means to do something even though something bad might be a result of your action, to do something and not think about the positive or negative ramifications, or consequences, of your action.
Becky, however, says, “Don’t be too hasty” (hasty). That means don’t be so rushed, don’t do it quickly, think about this decision. She says, “Let’s sleep on it and talk about it tomorrow.” “To sleep on it” means to think about something overnight; to go home, to fall asleep, continue thinking about it, and the next day you make your decision. Saeed says, “You can do that if you want to, but I’ve made up my mind (I’ve decided). The question is: Are you with me?” meaning are you going to help me; support me; agree with me.
Let’s listen to the dialogue now at a normal speed.

Culture Note
In 1989, the U.S. government “enacted” (made into law) the Whistleblower Protection Act. This “Act” (law) was created to protect” government workers who report “misconduct” (bad, inappropriate behavior). “Official” (authority; leader) or “agency” (department) misconduct might include “gross” (serious; severe) mismanagement or “misuse” (inappropriate use) of government “funds” (money).
The law was created because some government workers had been complaining that they were being punished for having blown the whistle on their agency. For example, if they shared information about agency misconduct, they might be told that they had done a good thing, but then a few weeks or months later they might not receive a “promotion” (a move to a better job with more responsibility and better pay) or they might even be “fired” (lose their job). This was a strong “disincentive” (something that makes one not want to do something) against blowing the whistle on agency misconduct.
“Theoretically” (in theory, but not necessarily in reality), government workers should now feel more comfortable blowing the whistle on official misconduct or agency misconduct, because according to the Whistleblower Protection Act they won’t have to “suffer” (feel pain from) negative consequences. However, it can be hard to “enforce” (make sure a law is followed) the Act. Agency officials might argue that their “personnel” (related to human resources) decisions are unrelated to the whistleblower’s actions. For example, they might say that a whistleblower was fired because he or she wasn’t doing the job very well, even though he or she was really fired in “retaliation” (revenge). It can be very difficult or impossible to prove the reason why someone has been fired.
