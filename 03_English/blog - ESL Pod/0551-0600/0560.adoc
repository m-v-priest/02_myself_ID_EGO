This episode is about a boss and someone who works for him, talking about learning the rules and the procedures at a new job. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
I was happy to finally get a job, but I wasn’t ready for a first day of work like this one.
…
Boss: This is your first day and my job is to give you the rundown on how we do things around here. This is a well-oiled machine. Everybody has to pull his or her weight, or things don’t run smoothly. Got that?
Olivia: Yes, I do. I’m here to learn and to get up to speed as quickly as possible.
Boss: Good. I expect you to know the drill and be able to fall in line by the end of the week.
Olivia: I will do my very best.
Boss: We don’t like surprises around here, so we’ve built our workday around a lot of routines that every employee follows. We expect people to arrive at 8:30 on the nose. That’s our start time and there is no leeway whatsoever. If you’re habitually late, you’re out. Got that?
Olivia: Got it.
Boss: We’re no run-of-the-mill company. We have a tried and true system here and we expect all of our employees to follow lockstep. Got that?
Olivia: Yes, sir.
…
I needed a job, but when I was offered this one, I didn’t know what I was letting myself in for. I didn’t have a new boss. I had a drill sergeant!
[end of dialogue]
The story begins with Olivia saying, “I was happy to finally get a job, but I wasn’t ready for a first day of work like this one.”
The boss says to Olivia, “This is your first day and my job is to give you the rundown on how we do things around here.” The phrase “to give (someone) the rundown” (one word) means to present the basic information about something to another person. We might also call this an “overview,” a general idea of what it is you are talking about. Olivia’s boss is going to give her the rundown on how they do things in that office. The boss says, “This (meaning this business or this office) is a well-oiled machine.” That expression, “a well-oiled (oiled) machine,” means that it works very well, it works very efficiently, it doesn’t make mistakes; they don’t waste time or money. A well-oiled machine is something that works without problems; it’s very efficient. In many machines, for example in the engine or motor of your car, you have oil so that the metal that is touching other metal is able to move freely or easily; that’s where the expression originally comes from, I think.
The boss says, “Everybody has to pull his or her weight, or things don’t run smoothly.” “To pull your weight,” or “to pull your own weight,” means to do what you are supposed to do as part of the group or as part of the team. We might also say “to do your fair share,” meaning you’re supposed to do what you are told to do – assigned to do – in order to help the whole group. If not everyone pulls his or her weight, the boss says things don’t run smoothly. “To run smoothly” means to operate or function without any problems, the way things are supposed to work. The boss then says to Olivia, “Got that?” Got that?” as a question is an informal, somewhat impolite way of asking someone if they understand. We might also say, “You got it?” It’s usually a parent to a child, or a boss to an employee, but it’s still not a very nice way to ask someone if they understand something. You would instead say, “Do you understand what I’m saying?” or “Do you understand that?”
Olivia says, “Yes, I do. I’m here to learn and to get up to speed as quickly as possible.” The expression “to get up to speed” means to learn all that you need to learn, especially when you are a new employee or a new member of an organization, where all the other employees or members know everything. You don’t know anything, so you need to work hard to get up to speed – to know what the other people know.
The boss says, “Good. I expect you to know the drill and be able to fall in line by the end of the week.” “To know the drill” (drill) means to know what is going to happen and what you need to do, to know what to expect and what is expected of you in particular. So, knowing the procedures is knowing the drill. The boss expects her to know the drill and be able to fall in line by the end of the week. “To fall in line” means to do what is expected of you, what you have been asked to do without complaining, without saying, “Oh, I don’t want to do this,” without making mistakes. That’s to fall in line. Sometimes we use this expression when you are trying to change people’s opinions or actions, and if one person changes their mind or starts doing something differently, the others, especially if that person is a leader, will fall in line.
Olivia says, “I will do my very best (I will do the best that I can).” The boss says, “We don’t like surprises around here (here at this company), so we’ve built our workday around a lot of routines that every employee follows.” “We’ve built our workday” – we’ve planned our work using these routines. A “routine” is something that is done the same way every time; the order doesn’t change. Most of us have routines when we get up in the morning. We may go into the bathroom and brush our teeth, or take a shower, or go exercise, and then eat breakfast, etc. That would be your routine, the way you do things every morning. Maybe your routine is every day you get up, you drink a bottle of beer, and you go to work. I hope that’s not your routine, but, you know, maybe somebody out there does that!
The boss says, “We expect people to arrive at 8:30 on the nose.” “On the nose” is an expression – an informal expression we use in talking about time when we mean exactly, precisely: “I want you here at 8:30 on the nose.” Not 8:29, not 8:31; 8:30. Two other ways of saying this are “on the button” (button) and “on the dot” (dot). The boss says, “That’s our start time (that’s the time we start working) and there is no leeway whatsoever.” “Leeway” (leeway – one word) is freedom to break the rules; freedom to do something the way you want to, not the way the rules are. It can also mean, more generally, flexibility. If someone says, “I want you here at 8:30, but I’ll give you some leeway,” meaning you could come at 8:35, maybe 8:40 without getting into trouble. Well, not at this company, there’s no leeway whatsoever. “Whatsoever” (one word) means not at all. It’s used to emphasize a negative in a sentence. “She had no luck whatsoever in getting her novel published.” She had no luck; the “whatsoever” is used for emphasis. The boss says, “If you’re habitually late, you’re out.” “Habitually” means regularly, normally, time and time again, something that often or always happens. “He habitually wears sunglasses, even at night.” He must be some sort of rock star; you know they all do that; they wear the sunglasses even though there’s no sun. Maybe because their routine when they get up in the morning is to drink a bottle of beer, then you can understand why the sunglasses are there! The boss says, “If you’re habitually late, you’re out,” meaning you will be fired; you will lose your job. Once again, he says, “Got that?”
Olivia responds by saying, “Got it,” meaning I understand. The boss then says, “We’re no run-of-the-mill company.” “Run-of-the-mill” (hyphens in between each word) means ordinary. We’re not like other companies, we’re not typical, we’re not ordinary; we’re special is what he’s saying. He says, “We have a tried and true system here and we expect all of our employees to follow lockstep.” “Tried and true” means something that has been tested and has been shown to work well. My friend had a tried and true system for finding a girlfriend in college. He would take classes that had mostly women in them so his odds – his chances – were better. For example, at my university the foreign language classes had more women, a lot more women than men. That’s why I was a Spanish major! The boss says that they expect the employees at the company to follow lockstep. “Lockstep” (one word) means doing things in the same way, at the same time as everyone else – no changes, no leeway, no flexibility.
Once again, the boss says, “Got that?” and Olivia says, “Yes, sir.” “Yes, sir” is rather formal. It’s almost something you would hear more often in the military, and that’s really the idea that Olivia wants to convey – wants to show. Olivia said, “I needed a job, but when I was offered this one, I didn’t know what I was letting myself in for.” “To let yourself in for (something)” means to put yourself in a difficult or even dangerous situation. If someone says to you, “You don’t know what you’re letting yourself in for,” they’re trying to warn you, they’re trying to tell you that this is going to be difficult, more difficult than you think. Olivia says, “I didn’t have a new boss (at her work). I had a drill sergeant!” A “drill sergeant” is a person who works in the military and whose job it is to tell new soldiers what to do. Usually drill sergeants are very tough, and they yell a lot to try to get the new soldiers to obey and to get used to being shouted at and being given orders. We use the expression to mean someone who is too authoritarian, somebody who is too tough, somebody who tries to operate their company as if it were the army. That’s the joke that Olivia is making at the end here.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

What Else Does It Mean?
on the nose
The phrase “on the nose,” in this podcast, means exactly or precisely: “If you can guess on the nose how many beans are in this jar, you’ll win $1,000.” The phrase “to lead (someone) by the nose” means to force someone to go somewhere: “Yolanda has a terrible fear of dentists, and her friends had to lead her to her appointment by the nose.” The phrase “to be as plain as the nose on (one’s) face” means to be very obvious or easy to see or understand: “The answer is as plain as the nose on your face. I don’t know why you think this is so hard.” The phrase “to rub (someone’s) nose in (something)” means to remind someone about something that he or she has done wrong: “I know I made a mistake. You don’t have to keep talking about it and rubbing my nose in it.”
tried and true
In this podcast, the phrase “tried and true” describes something that has been tested and shown to work well: “Making micro loans to entrepreneurs is a tried-and-true way to stimulate the local economy.” The phrase “too good to be true” is used to describe something that is unbelievable because it seems too good: “An offer to sell you a big-screen TV for $60 is too good to be true.’” The phrase “true colors” describes one’s true beliefs, feelings, or opinions when one isn’t hiding anything: “When people are under a lot of stress, they start to show their true colors.” Finally, the phrase “true to (one’s) word” means keeping one’s promise, or doing what one has said one would do: “How do I know you’ll stay true to your word?”
Culture Note
The U.S. “military” (the organizations and people who fight for a country) has many “ranks” (the level or amount of power a person has in an organization). People who “serve” (work for) their country well are rewarded with a higher rank. People with a higher rank have greater responsibility and receive greater respect from people with a lower rank. For example, people with a lower rank are supposed to “salute” (hold one’s hand to one’s forehead and then quickly move it away) people with a higher rank and call them “sir.” People with a higher rank also “earn” (make money) more than people with a lower rank.
The ranks are slightly different in each “branch” (part) of the “Armed Services” (the U.S. military; the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, and Coast Guard). In the Army, a “Private” is a very common low rank, followed by “Private 2” and then “Private First Class.” A private can be promoted to a “Specialist” and then a “Corporal.” Then there are “Sergeants” and many “variations” (slight changes) on that rank, such as “Master Sergeant” and “Sergeant Major.” “Lieutenants,” “Captains,” and “Majors” are all high-ranking individuals, followed by “Colonels” and “Generals.” The highest-ranking individual in the U.S. Army is the “General of the Army.”
The U.S. Air Force has similar ranks. New “recruits” (people who have just begun to serve in the military) serve as low-ranking “Airmen.” Then they can become “Sergeants” and “Lieutenants,” followed by “Captains,” “Majors,” and “Colonels.” “Generals” are the highest-ranking officers, and the “General of the Air Force” has the highest ranking “of all” (higher than anyone else).
