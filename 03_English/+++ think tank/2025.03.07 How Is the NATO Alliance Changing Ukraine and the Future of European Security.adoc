."And here on stage I have with me Fiona Hill."

这句话语法正确，但有些冗余：

"I have with me Fiona Hill" 是正确的表达，但 "with me" 在口语中显得有些多余，"I have Fiona Hill on stage" 会更简洁。 +
"And here on stage" 也没有问题，强调位置。 +

更自然的表达方式： +
"And here on stage, I have Fiona Hill."（加逗号，更易读） +
"And here on stage with me is Fiona Hill."（更流畅，自然） +
"Joining me here on stage is Fiona Hill."（更正式、更自然） +

And we have with us Alina Polyakova, the president and chief executive 首席执行官 of the Center for European Policy Analysis 欧洲政策分析中心. A great panel 出色的讨论小组 here.

[.my2]
我非常高兴能讨论“乌克兰与欧洲安全的未来”，并讨论今天上午凯洛格将军的演讲，以及我们出色的演讲阵容。 首先让我介绍一下——他将以虚拟方式加入我们—— +
-> 这是 Pavlo Klimkin（听不清，技术故障）。他是乌克兰前外交部长，也是卡内基国际和平基金会的非常驻高级研究员。你好，Pavlo。 +
-> 我们还有 Philip M. Breedlove，他是前欧洲盟军最高司令，现在是佐治亚理工学院萨姆·纳恩国际事务学院的杰出教授和 CETS 高级研究员。非常感谢您的加入。  +
-> 在台上，我身边还有 Fiona Hill，她现在是布鲁金斯学会的高级研究员，但曾在 2017 年至 2019 年担任总统副助理和国家安全委员会的欧洲和俄罗斯事务高级主任。她也是外交关系委员会的成员 +
-> 我们还有 Alina Polyakova，她是欧洲政策分析中心的总裁兼首席执行官。这是一个出色的讨论小组。

Let me start straight ahead 直接开始 with a couple of questions to you. This meeting is on the record 公开记录, and then we will have enough time for questions and comments also from the audience 观众. We have a big set of issues 一系列重大问题. Perhaps let me start with you, Alina, because you have authored (v.)撰写 a piece 文章 in Foreign Affairs 外交事务 —I think it was actually December 31 that it was published —(laughs)—just *in time* 及时地；准时地 for the new year —where you argue that the Trump administration 特朗普政府 should pursue (v.)采取;追求，致力于，执行 a maximum pressure strategy 最大压力策略 towards Russia. And *it did seem*, to some extent 在某种程度上；部分地, in the first weeks of the administration *that* your advice was heard (v.)被听到. General Kellogg argued this morning that the maximum pressure strategy continues, but now there are also sticks 大棒 applied to Ukraine *to come to* the negotiation table 谈判桌. So what has changed, from your perspective （观察问题的）视角，观点;透视（画）法? And how do you read 解读 the current strategy?

[.my2]
让我直接开始向你们提出几个问题。本次会议是公开记录的，之后我们也会有足够的时间接受观众的提问和评论。我们有一系列重大问题。也许让我先从你开始，Alina，因为你在《外交事务》杂志上发表了一篇文章——我想是 12 月 31 日发表的——（笑）——正好赶上新年——你在文章中主张特朗普政府应该对俄罗斯采取最大压力策略。在政府上任的前几周，你的建议似乎在一定程度上被采纳了。凯洛格将军今天上午表示，最大压力策略仍在继续，但现在也对乌克兰施加了大棒，迫使其回到谈判桌前。那么，从你的角度来看，发生了什么变化？你如何解读当前的策略？



==== Alina Polyakova’s Response

Alina Polyakova: Well, thanks so much, Liana. It’s always great to be part of these conversations 对话 at CFR, which I think tend to be quite insightful 有见地的 and revealing 揭示性的 in various ways. Of course, the maximum pressure campaign 最大压力行动 continues. But it continues on Ukraine, not on Russia, is what we’ve seen. And that’s been a pretty profound 深刻的, I think, shift 转变 in how the United States is pursuing its engagement 参与 with both Russia, Ukraine, and Europe. But I think that is an understatement 轻描淡写, in the last week of events that we have all, I think, followed very, very closely. So at the beginning of the administration I think there were multiple potential pathways 多种可能的路径 that were being discussed by different individuals that were entering the administration, being appointed into various roles 担任各种职务. One was—that seemed to be the trajectory 轨迹 early on—where we need to get the Russians to the negotiating table, but they had laid out their maximalist position 最大主义立场, that they were not backing away from 退缩. So the question was how do we avoid a situation in which, you know, the Russians show up 出现 but it’s not in good faith 诚意, which is—tends to be the pattern 模式 of Russian negotiating, which is just negotiations for the sake of negotiations 为了谈判而谈判, to see what the other side is willing/able to offer, what the lines are, what the constraints 限制 are, But then there’s no—there’s no follow up 后续行动, it’s not an actual negotiation. It’s just a way to assess 评估 your opponent. The question is, how do we avoid that? My view has been always that the only way to avoid that vis-à-vis 面对 the Russians is to apply far, far more pressure on them to come to the negotiating table, make it painful 让他们感到痛苦 for them, so that they have no other choice but to compromise 妥协. Because I think until we are in that situation, they have no incentive 动机 to compromise. I think the Russians and Mr. Putin think they’re winning. They certainly think they’re winning now. I was just looking at some Russian media, mainstream media 主流媒体, if you could call it that—state-owned propaganda outlets 国有宣传机构—in Russia this morning. And the rhetoric 言论 on the United States is shifting quite dramatically 戏剧性地. You know, we’ve seen for decades Russian state media called the United States the enemy, the adversary 对手, use all kinds of pejorative terms 贬义词 for the so-called West, as they say. Shifted pretty profoundly. And I think that’s always a signal 信号 that they see a major geopolitical shift 地缘政治转变 happening right now. So the administration has obviously moved away from pursuing that kind of negotiation tactic 谈判策略. And I think, as a result, we find ourselves in a much weaker position 更弱的地位, as the United States. And then, on the other hand, we have seen a strategy of carrots 胡萝卜 for the Russians, and a strategy of sticks 大棒 for the Ukrainians. You know, I hope that the carrots that we’re giving to the Russians right now, that are weakening our negotiating hand 削弱我们的谈判筹码—because we’re basically playing with open cards 公开底牌, while the Russians are not. They have very clearly understood what we’re willing to give up, what we’re willing to give, because we’re just giving it all. And we can talk about what those things are. And I think, on the Ukrainian side, they are being pressured. They’re being pressured to probably accept a negotiation, eventually, that will not benefit them in the short, medium or long term 短期、中期或长期. And that I think we saw very much on display 展示 in the White House meeting last week, that I think we all watched and followed very closely the implications 影响 of. So I think that—what has shifted is that the administration’s policy has obviously gone in the maximum pressure direction towards Ukraine, and an incentive model 激励模式 to bring the Russians closer to the United States vis-à-vis the Russians.


Alina Polyakova：非常感谢，Liana。能参与外交关系委员会的这些对话总是很棒，我认为这些对话往往非常有见地，并在多方面具有揭示性。当然，最大压力行动仍在继续。但我们看到的是，它继续施加在乌克兰身上，而不是俄罗斯。我认为，这是美国在处理与俄罗斯、乌克兰和欧洲的关系时发生的深刻转变。但我觉得这有些轻描淡写，尤其是在过去一周的事件中，我们都非常密切地关注着。在政府上任初期，我认为有许多可能的路径被不同的人讨论，这些人进入政府并担任各种职务。其中一条路径似乎是早期的轨迹——我们需要让俄罗斯人回到谈判桌前，但他们已经摆出了他们的最大主义立场，并且没有退缩。所以问题是如何避免俄罗斯人出现但没有诚意的情况，这往往是俄罗斯谈判的模式，即为了谈判而谈判，看看对方愿意或能够提供什么，界限在哪里，限制是什么，但没有后续行动，这不是真正的谈判，而只是评估对手的一种方式。问题是，我们如何避免这种情况？我的观点一直是，面对俄罗斯人，唯一的方法是施加更大的压力，迫使他们回到谈判桌前，让他们感到痛苦，这样他们别无选择，只能妥协。因为我认为，除非我们处于这种情况，否则他们没有妥协的动机。我认为俄罗斯人和普京先生认为他们正在获胜。他们现在当然认为自己正在获胜。我今天早上刚刚看了一些俄罗斯媒体，如果可以称之为主流媒体的话——国有宣传机构——关于美国的言论正在发生戏剧性的转变。几十年来，我们看到俄罗斯国家媒体称美国为敌人、对手，用各种贬义词来形容所谓的西方。现在这种言论发生了深刻的转变。我认为这总是一个信号，表明他们看到了当前正在发生的重大地缘政治转变。因此，政府显然已经放弃了这种谈判策略。我认为，结果是我们发现自己处于更弱的地位，作为美国。另一方面，我们看到对俄罗斯采取胡萝卜策略，对乌克兰采取大棒策略。我希望我们现在给俄罗斯的胡萝卜不会削弱我们的谈判筹码——因为我们基本上在公开底牌，而俄罗斯人没有。他们非常清楚地理解我们愿意放弃什么，愿意给予什么，因为我们正在给予一切。我们可以讨论这些是什么。我认为，在乌克兰方面，他们正在受到压力。他们可能会被迫接受一场谈判，最终这场谈判不会在短期、中期或长期内对他们有利。我认为这一点在上周的白宫会议中表现得非常明显，我们都非常密切地关注了其影响。因此，我认为发生的变化是，政府的政策显然朝着对乌克兰施加最大压力的方向发展，而对俄罗斯则采取激励模式，以拉近俄罗斯与美国的关系。

====  Liana Fix’s Transition to Fiona Hill

Liana Fix: Thank you, Alina. Now, Fiona, you have a lot of experience of negotiating with the Russians. You’ve been in Helsinki at that famous meeting between Trump and Putin, the one-on-one meeting. General Kellogg said this morning he understands, and the Trump administration understands, how the Russians negotiate. He told the anecdote that Russians are coming into the negotiation room and standing next to the doorways, the Americans are coming half the way into the room. What is—from your experience, what are the greatest pitfalls in negotiating with the Russian side that you see?

==== Fiona Hill’s Response

Fiona Hill: Well, first of all, I mean, I just want to commend the CFR for doing this, and actually also for being able to secure General Kellogg. And I know, because, actually, I think it was an extraordinarily important presentation. He was one thousand percent honest. And I worked with General Kellogg, he was a colleague, at the National Security Council in Trump 1.0. And he was just laying it all out for all of us. And I know Alina didn’t manage to make it in time, but I hope that she will listen to it afterwards. I think everybody should go back and listen to that again because there were some very important messages there from him. Now, General Kellogg does know about the Russians and how they negotiate. He’s been around that block many, many times. And, you know, I think if General Breedlove was, you know, listening to this as well, and Former Minister Klimkin—Ambassador Klimkin, you know, I’m sure they’ll have some comments, particularly from the military perspective and from the on the ground in Ukraine. But I wouldn’t then, you know, attribute the views of General Kellogg, his analysis, to everybody else on the team around President Trump, because I don’t think everybody else there, including, with all due respect to Special Envoy Witkoff, have got that same experience. And I can see Angela Stent here in the audience. And Angela’s often commented in the same way that Alina did, about, you know, the danger of giving carrots to the Russians. Depending on the texture of the carrots, they’ll either eat them or they’ll take them and hit you over the head with them. (Laughter.) And I think that that’s kind of, you know, one of the risks that we’re seeing at the moment, because what I’ve seen coming back in some of the pronouncements—again, not from General Kellogg but from some of the statements from Special Envoy Witkoff and others—is that they’ve taken completely on board both the Russian talking points and the Russian positions. I mean, earlier was the question—Margaret Brennan tried to get to this, other people did from the audience—and the question was asking about, what was the term sheet, you know, from the Russians. I think we can see very clearly. First of all, “bilateral irritant” that was mentioned in one of the announcements is Russian code for absolutely every single thing that they’re angry with the United States about. So it’s not bilateral irritants from the United States’ point of view, because we mostly don’t pay attention to some of these issues. But it’s all of the—kind of the Russian positions. When General Kellogg, you know, was talking about the Ukrainian term sheets, I think the Ukrainians have been pretty consistent. Everything is a loss to Ukraine. Let’s be clear about this. Every single thing that Ukraine is having to negotiate with is a loss. Every single thing. Every single thing is a concession because they’re the country that was invaded. And the Russians have made it very clear, which was also laid out in some of the discussion, that they want territory that they currently do not control. So is the concession from the Russians going to be that they’ll only take parts of Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, or Donetsk, Luhansk that they currently don’t control, and then they won’t go further? That would be, you know, not much of a concession, from the Ukrainian point of view. Every single thing that Ukrainians are being asked to do is to concede. Now, I also understand from listening to General Kellogg very carefully—look, again, I just want to say, we should all be very grateful that he’s laid all of this out. It was very clear. That the Ukrainians obviously missed a beat because something was completely lost in translation. And, again, I think Zelensky made a fatal error by not having everything translated. And my advice from, you know, basically being in the administration, or any administration—all the people here who’ve worked in Foreign Service—would be: Do not negotiate, have a discussion, anything, that is not in your native language, no matter how you speak it. I say the same to Macron. If I was the Brits, I would have somebody translate from British to American all the time as well—(laughter)—because sometimes things are lost as well, just to be very clear. And I know that, you know, Prime Minister Starmer was already here, and President Trump loved his accent. But have, you know, your American interpreter, you know, to be—because things are lost all the time. And I think that what Zelensky didn’t understand that he was being offered a treaty of sorts. That only actually occurred to me as I was listening to General Kellogg, because President Trump doesn’t abide by any of the contracts or treaties that were signed by any previous government. And when Zelensky said to President Trump—and I watched, actually, that press conference five times to try to kind of figure out where things went wrong. There were multiple points, but one of them was when President Zelensky pointed to your president, he kept saying to President Trump, who already signed agreements—either Obama or Biden. And President Trump cast those aside. What President Trump was actually telling Zelensky is, you’re signing something with me. This will be the only thing that you’re signing, a basic exchange of letters, but it’s kind of a treaty of sorts. President Trump doesn’t care about the Budapest Memorandum from 1994. He wasn’t there. He doesn’t care about any of the other commitments or recognitions of Ukraine that have been made, or U.N. resolutions, because they weren’t made by him. And up until this point there’s been no agreement between Ukraine and President Trump. And that’s what we were being told. And I had a bit of a eureka moment sitting at the back when I kind of realized that that was the case. And I don’t think that President Zelensky understood that, because, again, his English is not that good. I mean, even, you know, kind of, for those of us English speakers, we’re not always understanding the import because we don’t fully understand, as General Kellogg does. Because remember, General Kellogg has been with President Trump from the very beginning, from his first campaign. He understands him better than anyone. He’s still there with him. Other people don’t understand that in exactly the same way. And you have to have different levels of interpretation. What does President Trump himself mean, and what does the actual translation of the words mean? It’s the context and the content. And that’s why I would kind of go back to your initial question, is I—with all due respect to Special Envoy Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and everybody else who went there—without any interpretation or context they have no clue what the Russians are actually talking to them about. Their interpretation is coming from directly speaking to Ushakov, Lavrov, and Kirill Dmitriev, who all speak excellent English, and who have been around this block forever, and who completely understand who they are, how they interact in their system, how the other system interacts. Remember, Kirill Dmitriev was at Harvard. He’s worked for a whole host of—Goldman Sachs, all kinds of other, you know, kind of Western entities. He knows exactly who he is, who he’s talking on behalf of, how far he can go. And his English is impeccable. And so I think, you know, unfortunately—and this is what the Russians are telling us—I mean, if you look, as Alina is doing, at the Russian interpretation of all of this, you know, they’re being quite scathing. We haven’t even got the junior varsity on the team here. We’ve got the—you know, the intermural, or basically the pickup game. And they are thinking right now that they can manipulate this. Now, General Kellogg is saying, we’ll see when we get there. But, you know, at this point the United States is going out of the door with the Russians on their side of the table, not just reaching that point. And General Kellogg himself understands this, but I’m not so sure that the other people around him do.

==== Liana Fix’s Transition to Pavlo Klimkin

Liana Fix: That’s a very helpful analysis, Fiona, of both the speech of General Kellogg but also the past meetings. Let me turn now to Pavlo Klimkin. Thanks so much for joining us for this discussion. There has been some hope, from a Ukrainian perspective, that there could be a reset in U.S.-Ukraine relations after this meeting in the White House. Now it seems—and we’ve heard this again from General Kellogg this morning, that it is unclear how any reset would look like, that some of the negotiation levers that the administration sees it has towards Ukraine will be kept in their hands for longer period of time to try to use them not only for the economic partnership agreement or the minerals deal, but potentially also for other concessions that they want to see from the Ukrainian side. What is Ukraine’s strategy to react to that? And I know it’s tough to develop a strategy under such high pressure, but what would you recommend?

==== Pavlo Klimkin’s Response

Pavlo Klimkin: Good afternoon from Kyiv. We have to develop our strategy. And we have to get an answer. But if you talk to Ukrainians—and, I mean, not only in Kyiv, and I’ve been driving a lot around the country, it’s a sort of emotional shock for many, many people because, firstly, many welcomed the idea of peace through strength. But now people see a lot of strengths towards Ukraine and basically no strength towards the Russians. So someone should have, you know, exchanged the baskets with carrots and something else. It’s basically the sense if you’re not in Kyiv, if you just talk to people. The second point, which worries me even more, it’s a kind of focus on eventual NATO expansion as a fundamental origin of that. And Putin has been talking about the origins. And it’s a fundamentally flawed understanding why the war is like that, and why the war had started. The reason for that is that anybody in Russia and anybody in the Russian leadership fundamentally reject the mere fact that Ukraine is there. Ukrainian history, Ukrainian language, Ukrainian statehood—basically everything. And in 2014, when the invasion into the Crimea started, we were constitutionally a sort of non-bloc country.

==== Pavlo Klimkin’s Continued Response

Pavlo Klimkin: It’s really important to understand because the fundamental reason for that is that Russia sees us as a kind of ill-fated role, Russia and us as Russians. So if you ask an AI app what to do if you need to eliminate this order, you get your answer. So if you ask a wrong question, and if you mention a set of wrong origins, you are fundamentally nowhere. And I’m afraid it’s partly what’s happening now. Third point, we clearly understand that we need our European allies on our side. We need a strategy, a common strategy with them, because there is no way European security or European security architecture, but also by definition European security, can be there without Ukraine. Unfortunately, this point is coming down into the minds of many European politicians and also militaries, but not really into European societies. There is a clear asymmetry here. But what the new U.S. administration has already achieved is actually the Chinese talking directly to the Europeans and saying, yeah, of course, you should be at the table. Of course, Europe is important. So the whole geopolitics now are changing. In our way, we are, of course, ready to show again that we need our allies. We are ready to enter into difficult negotiations, but not at our expense, and not over our head. What fundamentally would not work. Actually, both U.S. and Russia got us wrong in 2022, in the sense of our resilience, in the sense of our emotions, and in the sense of our understanding what is at stake in this war. And we understand that it’s about our existence as Ukrainians. So we are ready to engage in real conversation. Also, it’s a backdrop of these emotional spikes. But now if you talk to Ukrainians, just Ukrainians, not somebody from political classes or so, many people started saying, look, maybe it’s about Europe, and us about part of Europe. But it’s a very dangerous development because it would lead to a total fragmentation of the West and probably the mere question what actually the West is about now. And our strategy in the coming weeks is, of course, to get back with our engagement, to repair what we can repair, and to build a decent conversation. And we are ready for that. But also to engage in every way possible with the Europeans. And we have a European summit now happening in Brussels. A number of ideas there. And it’s about how to include Europe as a fundamental, intrinsic part of the European reality, is how I see it now.

==== Liana Fix’s Transition to General Breedlove

Liana Fix: That’s very helpful. Thank you. And you mentioned two things which are so important, I think, the European strategy but also the China element in that. And I hope we can come back to that in the Q&A and in the comments section. But, General Breedlove, if I could turn to you on the question of Europe. Europeans have been asked and invited by the Trump administration to take over the security guarantees question in Ukraine, right? So it seems that there is an idea for division of labor, that the United States negotiates the ceasefire and the Europeans secure the ceasefire. Now, Europeans have come to town asking for a backstop for that mission, although it’s unclear what exactly that backstop will look like. General Kellogg has also not specified it this morning. Under these conditions, would you recommend Europeans to go for the security guarantee, to go for a European mission in Ukraine? And what could this look like?

==== General Philip M. Breedlove’s Response

Philip M. Breedlove: Well, first of all, thank you all for having me. It’s a pleasure to be on stage with these two and with Pavlo as well. And before I go to your question, I just want to pass that, of course, I agree with what Pavlo has said, but I want to violently agree with a few points Alina and Fiona made, about how we’re being perceived in the world at dealing with the two sides of this issue. On one side, we’ve got a criminal aggressor. And in the world’s eye, we’re treating that criminal aggressor with kid gloves. On the other side we have a nation that’s been invaded, clearly the victim. And we seem to be dealing with them with a hammer. And so it’s—I don’t want to resurface all the conversation, but it’s hard for some of us who travel a lot in Europe to be able to sit down with our allies and discuss why this might be happening. And I want to highlight two things. Right out of the gate we have given Russia huge policy wins. For decades and decades, Mr. Putin has wanted to deal with America about Europe without Europe. And we’ve always kept Europe in the middle of the conversation. And we fought hard not to allow Mr. Putin to establish this idea that he is above Europe, and he should be able to do European matters with the American president one on one, whoever the American president is. And we seem to now have caved on that, and that we are now doing business with Mr. Putin on Europe without Europe. And in a similar fashion, since the winter of 2013 and ’14, when I was the SACEUR and Russia first invaded Crimea and then invaded the Donbas, we have all said that we will not deal about Ukraine without Ukraine. And now we are caving on that as well. So before the negotiations even start we have given huge, huge policy concessions to Russia. And I don’t think we’re walking in the door with a strong hand when that’s the way we begin. So I’ll get off of that, and now get to the question you asked me. I just wanted to agree with what both Alina and Fiona had said, in my own words. So, first of all, I applaud what Europe is doing, OK? So forever there has been some—and legitimate, I would add, complaints about how Europe has approached Article 3—not Article 5, but Article 3. Article 3, in a Georgia boy’s words, are that defense begins at home. In other words, these nations need to invest in themselves. Some people use the word wrong. They’re not paying. They don’t pay. They invest. And so these people are now really climbing on the stump and investing in their own militaries and their capabilities. So you can’t even have a conversation about Article 5 if you haven’t got Article 3 right. And I think we’re on our way to getting Article 3 right. Article 4 is also not being taken care of right now because Article 4 says that the United States, as one of the allies—one of the allies—should be sitting at the table consulting with European allies about these matters. When Article 4 is declared, the allies of NATO come together and discuss. We don’t go off and have single conversations with the criminal aggressor about matters Europe. And so if we have Article 3 straight, if we get Article 4 straight, then it’s much easier to talk about what we need to do now. Which is, yes, maybe it’s a good idea that the Europeans are the bulk of the land contribution to what might happen to secure Ukraine’s future. But America has to be a part of that as well. And I think we’ve sort of cleared the air, but early in these conversations one of our seniormost ministers sort of made an intimation that we would not honor our Article 5 if something broke out. We’re telling the Europeans to go there, take care of this problem, and we won’t be with you if a dust up occurs with Russia? I think that’s—we’ve got to clean that up. We need to make a public, demonstrative, clear commitment to Article 5 as an ally in the NATO alliance.

==== Liana Fix’s Transition to Audience Q&A

Liana Fix: Wonderful. Thank you, General. That has been excellent. First, Alina, do you want to come in with two fingers, and then we will open up for questions or comments from the audience?

Alina Polyakova: No, just a very quick comment to what General Breedlove just laid out on the backstop conversation. I think one of the epiphanies I’ve had recently in conversations with administration officials is that, just like the president sees the world very differently than perhaps many of us in this room, or the Ukrainians, and we need translation, there’s another element to this. Which is that it’s really hit me that he—and probably others around him—do not see Ukraine and NATO as connected issues. Meaning there’s a ceasefire in Ukraine. That’s one issue. And that’s what we’re trying to get to, from the perspective of the president. And then there’s the NATO question, which is completely separate. But of course, in Europeans’ minds these are deeply intertwined, interlinked issues, because of all the reasons that General Breedlove just laid out. We’re going to have a European-led coalition, may not be a full NATO coalition, five, six countries, whatever that looks like, will the U.S. be there to protect and defend those forces in Ukraine, even if it’s not a NATO force? And so in the president’s mind tying NATO, Article 5, collective defense to the ceasefire in Ukraine is completely incomprehensible. So he sees this as completely separate issues. And Europeans do not. So, to your question, I think, that you had posed, Liana, Europeans are coming asking for a backstop but it’s incomprehensible to the president as to why they’re talking about it.

Liana Fix: Hmm. Yeah.

Fiona Hill: I want to do a two-finger to the—(laughter)—because it’s the global dimension of this as well. And I was actually heartened to at least hear General Kellogg, for the first time, frankly, of an administration official, really laying out the global dimensions of this, of China, North Korea, and also Japan being—and Japan, which I was not going to mention Japan, because this is why I’m raising this—and Iran being involved here, because this is important for our other allies—for Japan, and South Korea, and Taiwan, and many other countries out there watching all of this very closely. But I was not heartened by the same issues that Alina is laying out here. When General Kellogg said that for President Trump these have always been before separate, that everybody was trying to keep North Korea, China, and, he said, Iran, and Russia all separately. Well, they’re not separate. They’ve become pretty fused together here. And that counts for Europe as well. You said it. China is an important issue. Well, Europe and Europeans have their own relationship with China. China was the biggest single country investor in Ukraine before the war, and has then sided very consistently with Russia in this conflict. North Korean troops are in Europe. They’re not just in the Kursk region of Russia. They’re fighting in Europe for the first time. I think General Kellogg was absolutely 100 percent right that, are they preparing for something on the Korean Peninsula? South Korea and Japan have to worry about all of that. So these have to be dimensions as well. And South Korea and Japan are watching this and, as I said, Taiwan and others, very closely. And then the Middle East. It was fascinating as well that General Kellogg said we all started getting involved in this with Saudi Arabia because of MBS. Well, yes, because they’re all watching Iran. And they’re watching how this has now become part of the Middle East conflict as well. The fact that meetings are taking place in Saudi Arabia, and in Turkey, and elsewhere just shows how things are really shifting here. So this isn’t just about Ukraine. You can’t just separate it off and then basically push Ukraine out the door, and figure out that you can then deal with this on the same kind of playing field as before.

Liana Fix: Yeah, the global impacts there. General Breedlove, I’m going to pretend that I haven’t seen your two fingers, because I really—(laughter)—which is unfair, because you’re on screen, on Zoom. I know it’s unfair. But I will come back to you when we have first lot of questions, and you can tie in what you wanted to say, because I really want to give our audience the opportunity to ask questions here. We have an audience here in Washington and on Zoom. And I will bring you in. Please identify yourself and also keep your question short. And if you can say to whom this question is directed, all the better. So I’ll take the first question from the room. Over here.

==== Audience Q&A: Question 1

Q (Alexandra Starr): I’m Alexandra Starr with International Crisis Group. This is a question for Fiona. Why is Trump doing this? (Laughter.) You’ve worked with him for a long time. Well, you’ve had experience with him in the first administration. His comments during that press conference, talking about everything that he and Vladimir Putin had been through together seems to speak to a psychological dimension to this that I’d be very grateful to get your comments on.

Liana Fix: Fiona.

Fiona Hill: Well, look, I think General Kellogg also made some of the things very clear. President Trump is very interested in strength, and not in weakness. And if you go back again to that press conference, I think lots of things were very clear. It’s about respect. Remember, at one point when President Zelensky was asking him about, well, does nothing matter about what Obama or Biden, your presidents—you meaning United States presidents—have committed to in the past? President Trump at that point lost his temper, basically saying don’t compare me with Presidents Obama and Biden. They were weak people. Nobody respected them. Everybody respects me. So it gets back to—you mentioned Helsinki, which is a painful episode, I think, for myself personally, and for many others, where President Trump has always made it very clear that the people who he sees as his peers are the strong men in the world. And that would be Putin. It’s not his staff. It’s certainly not his intelligence advisors or anything like that. It’s people like Vladimir Putin. He respects strength. Now, I think General Breedlove is probably wanting to come in. And I remember actually being on a panel with him sometime before when he said a lot of the strength in Russia is illusory. He commented on the—and you’ll remember this, General Breedlove—on the forces that the Russians had amassed on the border—180,000, 200,000, roughly. And pointed out that this was about the capacity of the Tennessee Volunteers stadium, for example. I think that was one of the ones that you used. I’ve been in that stadium. And when those people basically go out and dissipate across a large area, it’s almost as if there’d be nobody there at all. The strength of Russia at this point is more than it is in actuality. We haven’t mentioned, 870,000 Russian casualties—people killed in action and severely wounded. And I noticed, actually, General Kellogg made no mention of the Russian casualties. He mentioned the Russian—or, it was really Soviet—casualties in World War II, and Ukrainians, Armenians, Georgians, Belarusians, you name it, Central Asians, Kazakhs, and others fought in World War II as Soviet citizens. It wasn’t all Russian casualties. This is a staggering scale of casualties on the part of Russia because that’s what Putin is prepared to pay, the price he’s prepared to pay. So I think in some respects Putin is strong in the sense that he’s willing to preside over a slaughter, which is something that clearly President Trump, and General Kellogg, and others are not, to their credit. But it’s basically a misreading on the part of, I think, President Trump about who Putin is, and the way that Putin thinks about things. President Trump thinks that President Putin respects him. He wants him to respect him. He talks about this all the time. And I think most of us would be, sadly, remiss if we didn’t realize that President Putin is playing that absolutely to the hilt. And that’s very unfortunate. And of course, when President Zelensky tried to point that out, that was another reason that he got bludgeoned in the White House. Anybody who points out an unpleasant message gets absolutely and utterly bludgeoned. And at some point that message will become clear, when President Putin tries to manipulate something. But then I suspect that President Trump will blame other people and not blame President Putin.

Liana Fix: Thank you, Fiona. I’ll give General Breedlove the opportunity to also quickly come in on that question.

Philip M. Breedlove: So I want to get to that two-finger I raised before as well.

Liana Fix: That you can tie into. (Laughs.)

Philip M. Breedlove: Many of us remember when we were young, our parents said: People don’t care what you say. They care what you do. I’m often asked, what is our policy towards North Korea? Or what is our policy China-Taiwan? Or what is our policy about Iran? And I point out to them that these things are well stated. You can do a simple Google search and you will see that policy. But then I make them angry because I say, none of that really matters because people don’t care what you say. They care what you do. Our North Korea policy, our Iran policy, our Russia, China-Taiwan—all the policies in the world are now really being written every day in Ukraine. The world is watching what we do towards our commitments to Europe and Ukraine, about European security. So you can have all those other things written you want, but people are watching what we do. It’s an interesting point that Fiona brings up about casualties and costs. I believe right now that Russia needs a ceasefire worse than anybody. They need it worse than anybody. They’re backing up in the last two days in the Donbas. And they’re throwing bodies at Kursk in an amazing way. They have now asked North Korea twice to send soldiers to help them recapture sovereign Russian land, OK? So twice now they are asking North Korea to help them retake Russian land. That should tell you a lot about the state of the Russian army. They desperately need a ceasefire. And they want us to guarantee that ceasefire via these agreements, so that they can refit, rebuild. It’s going to take them three, four, maybe even five years to get really ready again, because their army has been decimated so badly. But they’ll—unless they run into something hard, unless the bayonet runs into something hard, they will be back.

Liana Fix: Thank you, General. I think we now have a question—or, we take another one from the room. So the lady over here.

==== Audience Q&A: Question 2

Q (Christina Segal-Knowles): Thank you. Christina Segal-Knowles, former National Security Council. I was interested in taking conversation back to the China dimension. I think we heard from General Breedlove that he sees connections here, but then when you turn to his comments on how are they putting pressure on Russia he talked about, for example, sanctioning the shadow fleet. China has clearly underwritten the Russian war effort, both through supply of materials and also because it is the purchaser, and increasingly the major purchaser, of Russian oil, keeping the economy afloat. I wondered, how should we think about—is it possible to bring about a lasting peace deal without a Chinese dimension? Is it possible to put maximum pressure on Russia without having China at the table, or in the conversation? And how should we think about the strategy in that context?

Liana Fix: I would—thank you so much. I would like to give this question to Pavlo Klimkin, because I think it would be particularly interesting to have an answer from the Ukrainian perspective there, how you see and Ukraine sees the China dimension. Because I think there has been partly an ambiguous policy towards China from Ukraine’s perspective throughout this war.

Pavlo Klimkin: China was and is helpful to Russia in supplying basically everything beyond lethal stuff. But I also believe the Chinese are not worried on Russia being eventually off hook, because they believe the level of dependence—and not just trade dependence, because Russia has 31 percent of export to China—39 percent of export and 31 percent of import. But in the sense of technology it’s basically a real dependency now. But even if you go to a normal Russian land bridge, in a Russian town in the middle of nowhere, you can get now a deposit in Chinese currency. It’s something fundamentally different. But the Chinese will be playing and are playing extremely smart towards Europe, now going towards Europe and saying, look, guys, see? I mean U.S. is not reliable anymore. And with us, you have reliability. You have trade reliability. You have security. You have all kind of dimensions around Eurasia. Why not just start elevating our partnership? And the Chinese are also smart, understanding their possibilities and being engaged for the first time ever in their history in talking about European security, about Ukraine, or about everything else. And not just talking, with all kind of their initiatives, but probably being present. Not at the level of troops or so but probably monitors. And the Chinese present at higher scale in the Western Balkans. Lukashenko is also under the umbrella. And probably they are instrumental, in the sense of delivering on his independence. So Ukraine would be extremely important for them, in the sense of understanding their future presence. So if they are ready to elevate their engagement with Europe, and now they feel the moment, if they are able to elevate their presence in Central and Eastern Europe, they are in a fundamentally different position in Eurasia. So I believe the Chinese will try to use this chance. The Chinese understand that if we go towards the West, it’s about the West to define what is possible and not possible in the sense of our security. So for them to be present in the European security is something fundamentally they would be willing to go for. So it’s the real moment for the Chinese. And I believe they will use this opportunity at full speed. And last point, who could have imagined us and North Koreans fighting in the Russian Kursk region three years ago? It was something totally mind-blowing. The Chinese clearly understand that security is now—I mean, can’t be seen in fundamentally geographical terms. They see it globally. And for them, it’s exactly the moment. But it’s also about the U.S. credibility. We have now four areas where Russia would push to restrain our sovereignty. It’s about territory. It’s about our potential to defend ourselves. It’s about our military forces and technologies. It’s about our future choice, NATO and the EU, but also how the future Ukraine should look like, in the sense of what kind of Ukraine. So in this sense, it’s also a moment where the Chinese would see the results of these negotiations as a fundamental weakness or strengths, in the sense of directions. And the Chinese will use it fully. I mean, believe me, they are good in analysis and they are good in feeling that the moment is there. There is a fundamental concept of the Chinese qi energy. It’s a kind of if you feel this moment or not. And I believe they do.

Liana Fix: (Laughs.) Thank you. And let’s just add to that that, in some European capitals, there certainly is a temptation to use China as a hedge against the potential negative consequences, tariffs towards Europe, by the Trump administration. Let’s take one more question from the virtual room, from Zoom.

==== Audience Q&A: Question 3 (Virtual)

Operator: We’ll take our next question from Ambassador Peter Galbraith.

Q (Peter Galbraith): Thank you. I want to—this has been terrific. And, Fiona, I especially appreciate your comments about negotiating in language, having done that in the Balkans in the 1990s. It’s a huge question. But I’ll preface this by saying we’re seeing very radical things from the Trump administration domestically—Elon Musk, DOGE, and so on. And therefore I wonder, General Breedlove, whether what we are seeing are actually concessions or a reorientation of U.S. foreign policy to an alliance of the strong, and where Trump can get what he wants—namely, to be part of the nexus of Russia, North Korea—you remember all the talk about the love letter from Kim Jong-un—and Iran, noting that at the time he applied maximum pressure on Iran he said he regretted doing it, or he had reservations about doing it. And the Russians recently have been saying they’d like to patch things up between the U.S. and Iran. At the same time as he’s talking about—he’s repeatedly critical of NATO, talked about pulling out of it. And possibly getting into a conflict with Europe if he, in fact, goes ahead and uses military force to seize Greenland. And perhaps he would even see letting Russia have what it wants in Ukraine as a quid pro quo for letting him take Greenland. I know it’s radical. We live in radical times.

Liana Fix: Thank you. Yeah, so let me boil down the question too is this tactics in negotiations, or is there a strategy behind it, a strategic realignment, or reorientation? General Breedlove.

Philip M. Breedlove: So I’ve told a lot of people in Europe that if anybody comes to you and tells you they know what President Trump is thinking, you should put down your pencil and turn off your recording device. And I’ll be the first to say, I cannot tell you what President Trump is thinking here. But observing what’s happening, you used the term, Mr. Ambassador—and thank you for the question—reorientation. I have a much more simplistic view of this. I haven’t read his whole book, but a friend of mine gave me a copy so that I could read chapter six, about how he does negotiations. And when he—things I remember from that chapter is, set an abnormally or unusually high bar so that when you can back away from it you’re seen as a good guy in the negotiation. So I look at a lot of these things, Mr. Ambassador, that you’re talking about, are grenades that have been thrown out on the table. And after they explode, we all see how it sorts out afterwards. So I take everything that is said, these very explosive kind of things that have been said, as just that explosive grenade, and let’s get to the more serious conversation after they clear. This morning I was on another show—I’m sorry—(laughter)—and I got hit with the question that all of a sudden there was a statement that we might want to remove the SACEUR from being an American officer. And I said, having been the SACEUR, I have some ideas about that. But I told them, I said: Listen, we need to let the dust settle. This could be Russian disinformation. When you see something that out of orbit, you should really just take the time to let the dust settle.

Fiona Hill: Liana, could I just say one quick thing about this? Because I do actually agree with General Breedlove that there’s a lot of grenade throwing here, cluster bombs actually more than just grenades. (Laughter.) And we can think of some other additions to the end of cluster as well—(laughter)—which is a result of all of this. But I think the problem is that other people do take it as a reorientation. And what we’re seeing now is our allies and our not-so-allies, adversaries and others, adjusting to this, just like the conversation about China. And other people have agency here. It’s not just one guy and one guy’s thoughts. First of all, there are 330 million Americans. But there are 550 million Europeans. And there are eight billion people on the planet who are all making, if they’ve got some information here, their own decisions and their own analyses about what is happening and how it affects them. So once you’ve blown things up you can’t necessarily put them back together again. And you can’t backtrack often from some of the positions that you’ve put out there. Because, I mean, the Russians are already acting accordingly, and lots of other people are as well.

Liana Fix: Mmm hmm. Great. Thank you, Fiona. We’ll take one more question from the room and one more question from online.

==== Audience Q&A: Question 4

Q (Benjamin Schmitt): Thank you. Benjamin Schmitt, University of Pennsylvania. I just want to make a couple of points on the sanctions discussion that we heard earlier from General Kellogg. He’s mentioning that we put a maximum pressure campaign through designation of hulls of Russian shadow fleet vessels. Yet, as he said himself, the enforcement has been lacking. I think that’s ongoing, but at the same time we’re also seeing what I think is to the rest of your points on a potential strategic realignment with the Russian Federation, when we see that there’s been notions that Trump has actually sent his envoy, Richard Grenell, to Switzerland a number of times to try to negotiate a return of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany, which is ludicrous. And there cannot be a return to business as usual in energy because, again, these—you know, we’re talking a lot—obviously, this is a Ukraine forum. But the Russian Federation is a malign actor well beyond Ukraine. There is active and ongoing sabotage operations, subsea cable cuts, subsea pipeline incidents, assassinations, all of these sort of things going on across the West that do, as President Zelensky said, come back and impact us here in the United States as well. So what can we do to kind of head off this strategic realignment? I don’t think there’s any chance that we will actually have a, quote/unquote, “reverse Nixon” and peel Russia to our side against China. I think they’ll just pocket the win and move on. But any thoughts on this, and how we can actually reorient ourselves to push back on this?

Liana Fix: Thank you so much. This has been reported about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, by the German Bild-Zeitung, which Grenell so far has denied. But I would like to give the question of sanctions to you, Alina, because there’s—and add one more, if I may, to your plate. (Laughs.) First of all, how much more could be done on sanctions with Russia? You have done some proposals on that. But also, could you comment on the Russian frozen assets? It almost seemed like General Kellogg in his presentation this morning was implicitly supportive of the European position to use the Russian frozen assets as leverage for Russia to adhere to a ceasefire. And to say, we will not take them now, but if you break a ceasefire then we take them? Which has been criticized by some economists, among others Irina Bukova, as too weak of a position. I would love to hear your views on that.

Alina Polyakova: No, thanks for that. I think I would just frame what you asked about sanctions, what can be done there, we haven’t used the full force of our sanctions abilities and enforcement abilities, as Ben just said. Certainly in the Russian energy sector, but also on the broader financial sector. The Biden administration, on its way out through executive order did more of that. Why they waited until the very last minute, I don’t know. But there’s still room for more. I think the question, to my mind, is how are we going to enforce all this when we’re also at the same time firing a lot of people that work on that? Because that’s a whole machinery that has to be set up. I don’t—I think Fiona and everyone else in this room knows that very well. So I don’t see much of a direction in which this administration is preparing for that. In fact, they’re preparing for the opposite, to Ben’s point. It seems to provide sanctions relief to the Russians, as part of this ongoing incentivizing with carrots strategy, if you want to call it that. But I think there’s also an interesting element that’s emerged in the conversations here about this perception of weakness and strength, right? And it struck me that there’s a similarity between how this administration is carrying out its current approach to Ukraine and how the Russians are carrying out their approach to us. Meaning that, to Fiona’s point on how President Trump thinks about strength and weakness and respect, if you show weakness, what happens is they just keep pushing more. So I think now that Zelensky has come back to the table, which he has no other choice. He must come back to the table, as Pavlo also said. But what that signaling is that the U.S. is going to keep pushing more and more, because now he’s seen in a weak position. And when you’re in a weak position, that means you have plenty you can still push on, right? So it’s actually going to increase the pressure, not decrease it, in my view. And the Russians are doing the exact same thing. With all of these incentives and carrots that we’re giving them, and will continue to give, they see a massive historic opportunity, in my view. They’re thinking about geopolitics. They’re thinking about restructuring the—and having a seat in the future of Europe’s security order, and beyond that, I think. And they are perceiving us as weak because we’re giving things away, which, to them, signals we’re going to keep pushing to see how far we can get. And they’ve obviously wanted regime change in Ukraine for a long time. And they have gotten us to talk about that now, right? This is their ultimate goal. They can get rid of Zelensky, put in someone that’s going to de facto give them political control of Ukraine. So there’s a strange similarity here, right? Except the Russians perceive us as weak right now, and we are perceiving Ukraine as weak, and both sides are pushing. And I think that’s really, really troubling, when you recognize that. And we’re talking about these geopolitical shifts. And I agree that Beijing sees this in geopolitical terms. The Russians see it in geopolitical terms. And everything that Pavlo said about China’s opportunities is really befuddling, because there’s only one thing that we know this administration has been very clear on, the president has been very clear on, is how much he sees China as the key problem for the United States. Yet, everything we’re doing right now in Ukraine, vis-à-vis our allies, vis-à-vis the economic wars that we’re setting up, it is giving China a massive, historic opportunity to emerge as the major victor of this war, having a foothold in Europe. I think that is something that will happen unless things shift. Really, we’re setting ourselves up for another confrontation from position of weakness, not a position of strength vis-à-vis China. It’s also moving the potential military confrontation over Taiwan closer and closer in time from the Chinese perspective, right? And so that’s the thing we want to avoid, but everything we’re doing is speeding up, I think, Chinese decision making and when they will have the opportunity to grab Taiwan. And that is really befuddling. And it signals to me, again, that certainly probably the president, maybe others in the administration, are not thinking about this in geopolitical, interconnected terms, as we’re talking about it here. They’re seeing very separate issues that, in their minds—in some of their minds, certainly—are probably not connected to each other. Which, of course, is not the reality that we live in. But that is the perception. And so the question is how do we engage and how do we work with this White House, which I think we should, frankly—we should want the president to succeed. Any U.S. president, we should want him to succeed. But there’s a huge understanding gap here in the perception of the world and how certain actions have consequences that is just not coming together.

Liana Fix: Can you also quickly say something about the frozen assets?

Alina Polyakova: Yeah, sorry about that. The frozen assets part, that’s been a befuddling—(laughs)—situation in Europe, in my view. Europe really needs to get money fast. And we’re seeing some of that happening in Germany and at the EU level as well. Those assets are just sitting there. Take them. Use them, now. You need the money. Ukraine needs the money. It’s right there. It’s not going to cost you anything. I think the concerns that are being raised about the implications of this, and is it precedent setting, the concerns raised by some economists that you mentioned, can be addressed. The best paper that I’ve seen on this is—and work on this is by Philip Zelikow, who wrote a paper a couple of weeks ago on the Hoover website that really takes a deep look as to what the situation is right now, because it’s changed in three years. The assets have been moved around. And they’re sitting as cash holdings, which also means they’re not making any money. Like this 300 billion dollars that can be invested and be earning interest rates, and it is not. So there’s also all kinds of questions about the mismanagement of these funds, basically, that could be actually also making money, far more interest rates. But I don’t understand, frankly, why there’s so much opposition in some parts of Europe against the assets. That is low, low hanging fruit.

Liana Fix: And it’s the question of will it be that leverage not to break a ceasefire. We have to come to an end, so I will give Fiona a quick thirty seconds last word here on the panel, because we have another great panel that is coming up in the end next. OK, Pavlo, thirty seconds for Fiona, thirty seconds for Pavlo, and then we will conclude, because we have another great session coming up in just fifteen minutes.

==== Closing Remarks

Fiona Hill: I think there’s an important point here, because we’re all members of Council on Foreign Relations, one way or another. So we tend to see the world from a foreign policy and a geopolitical perspective. And we heard from General Kellogg earlier this morning that that’s not President Trump—I always make that slip—(laughter)—because sometimes they see the world in the same ways, but very different ways. Because Putin does see it geopolitically, but Trump sees it economically and from a trade perspective. He doesn’t want a war with China over Taiwan. He’d give up Taiwan in a heartbeat for a bigger deal, a trade deal. And that’s essentially what he was telling Zelensky, that he needed to get with the program. I mean, again, it was very clear, from what General Kellogg said that Zelensky made a mistake because Trump sees the world in terms of everybody making some money and everybody getting something out of it. And if there’d been a deal signed on the minerals with the United States, with Trump and Zelensky, then everybody could have made something out of that. That’s what he’s trying to say. And he’ll make a deal with Russia. There’ll be all kinds of economic deals. He did that 1.0, the same kind of thing, looking for deals. And it’s also what he’s looking for with China. So I think we have to just orient ourselves in a different way and realizing that we’re all probably—(laughs)—not on the same page as where Trump is as well. And this explains, getting back to some of these questions, why there’s a disconnect all the time. And he does see this as a big deal between Russia, the United States, and China. That is how he sees the world, the big three sitting down and making deals.

Liana Fix: Yeah. Yeah, let me give just very quickly, Pavlo, the opportunity to say a very few last sentences, and then we will wrap this up. Pavlo.

Pavlo Klimkin: Yeah, one sentence about sanctions. Sanctions are actually quite good. The problem is the implementation. It’s a set of lost opportunities. And now you can forget about any sort of real sanctions in the future towards someone else. You can play with tariffs, but playing with sanctions is over. No credibility. And what is happening with the assets, what Alina has just said, is a kind of joke for many countries, and I know it. In one sentence, about our stakes now. So we are talking about why the Russian aggression against Ukraine had started and has happened. And Putin is talking in his own way about the origins of the war. And if you just want to have a break, so fundamentally in some moment it would backfire. And it would backfire for everyone, in the sense of lost in translation, and would be backfire also in the sense of total loss of credibility. And this is a fundamental law, and the world should understand.

Liana Fix: Thank you, Pavlo. I will—thank you. Thank you so much. Those were very good last words here, but also great lead over to the next session, which will discuss also Ukraine’s economic needs, reconstruction, and so on. So have a coffee break. Thank you so much for our panelists for joining us today. (Applause.) (END)

Introduction by Liana Fix

Liana Fix: So welcome to the second session of today’s symposium, titled Ukraine and the Future of European Security. I’m Liana Fix. I’m the fellow for Europe here at the Council on Foreign Relations, and I’ll be presiding over this discussion. Thanks for staying with us for this, and there will be another panel afterwards. I’m more than delighted to discuss “Ukraine and the Future of European Security,” to discuss what General Kellogg has presented this morning, with a fantastic lineup of speakers. Let me introduce first—he is going to join us virtually—this is Pavlo Klimkin—(inaudible, technical difficulties). He is former foreign minister of Ukraine. He’s also a nonresident senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Hi, Pavlo. We also have with us Philip M. Breedlove. He’s the former supreme allied commander Europe, and he is now a distinguished professor and CETS senior fellow at the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs at Georgia Tech. Thanks so much for joining us. And here on stage I have with me Fiona Hill, who’s now a senior fellow at Brookings but formerly was the deputy assistant to the president and senior director for European and Russian affairs at the National Security Council from 2017 to 2019. She’s also a CFR member. And we have with us Alina Polyakova, the president and chief executive of the Center for European Policy Analysis. A great panel here. Let me start straight ahead with a couple of questions to you. This meeting is on the record, and then we will have enough time for questions and comments also from the audience. We have a big set of issues. Perhaps let me start with you, Alina, because you have authored a piece in Foreign Affairs—I think it was actually December 31 that it was published—(laughs)—just in time for the new year—where you argue that the Trump administration should pursue a maximum pressure strategy towards Russia. And it did seem, to some extent, in the first weeks of the administration that your advice was heard. General Kellogg argued this morning that the maximum pressure strategy continues, but now there are also sticks applied to Ukraine to come to the negotiation table. So what has changed, from your perspective? And how do you read the current strategy?

Alina Polyakova’s Response

Alina Polyakova: Well, thanks so much, Liana. It’s always great to be part of these conversations at CFR, which I think tend to be quite insightful and revealing in various ways. Of course, the maximum pressure campaign continues. But it continues on Ukraine, not on Russia, is what we’ve seen. And that’s been a pretty profound, I think, shift in how the United States is pursuing its engagement with both Russia, Ukraine, and Europe. But I think that is an understatement, in the last week of events that we have all, I think, followed very, very closely. So at the beginning of the administration I think there were multiple potential pathways that were being discussed by different individuals that were entering the administration, being appointed into various roles. One was—that seemed to be the trajectory early on—where we need to get the Russians to the negotiating table, but they had laid out their maximalist position, that they were not backing away from. So the question was how do we avoid a situation in which, you know, the Russians show up but it’s not in good faith, which is—tends to be the pattern of Russian negotiating, which is just negotiations for the sake of negotiations, to see what the other side is willing/able to offer, what the lines are, what the constraints are, But then there’s no—there’s no follow up, it’s not an actual negotiation. It’s just a way to assess your opponent. The question is, how do we avoid that? My view has been always that the only way to avoid that vis-à-vis the Russians is to apply far, far more pressure on them to come to the negotiating table, make it painful for them, so that they have no other choice but to compromise. Because I think until we are in that situation, they have no incentive to compromise. I think the Russians and Mr. Putin think they’re winning. They certainly think they’re winning now. I was just looking at some Russian media, mainstream media, if you could call it that—state-owned propaganda outlets—in Russia this morning. And the rhetoric on the United States is shifting quite dramatically. You know, we’ve seen for decades Russian state media called the United States the enemy, the adversary, use all kinds of pejorative terms for the so-called West, as they say. Shifted pretty profoundly. And I think that’s always a signal that they see a major geopolitical shift happening right now. So the administration has obviously moved away from pursuing that kind of negotiation tactic. And I think, as a result, we find ourselves in a much weaker position, as the United States. And then, on the other hand, we have seen a strategy of carrots for the Russians, and a strategy of sticks for the Ukrainians. You know, I hope that the carrots that we’re giving to the Russians right now, that are weakening our negotiating hand—because we’re basically playing with open cards, while the Russians are not. They have very clearly understood what we’re willing to give up, what we’re willing to give, because we’re just giving it all. And we can talk about what those things are. And I think, on the Ukrainian side, they are being pressured. They’re being pressured to probably accept a negotiation, eventually, that will not benefit them in the short, medium or long term. And that I think we saw very much on display in the White House meeting last week, that I think we all watched and followed very closely the implications of. So I think that—what has shifted is that the administration’s policy has obviously gone in the maximum pressure direction towards Ukraine, and an incentive model to bring the Russians closer to the United States vis-à-vis the Russians.

Liana Fix’s Transition to Fiona Hill

Liana Fix: Thank you, Alina. Now, Fiona, you have a lot of experience of negotiating with the Russians. You’ve been in Helsinki at that famous meeting between Trump and Putin, the one-on-one meeting. General Kellogg said this morning he understands, and the Trump administration understands, how the Russians negotiate. He told the anecdote that Russians are coming into the negotiation room and standing next to the doorways, the Americans are coming half the way into the room. What is—from your experience, what are the greatest pitfalls in negotiating with the Russian side that you see?

Fiona Hill’s Response

Fiona Hill: Well, first of all, I mean, I just want to commend the CFR for doing this, and actually also for being able to secure General Kellogg. And I know, because, actually, I think it was an extraordinarily important presentation. He was one thousand percent honest. And I worked with General Kellogg, he was a colleague, at the National Security Council in Trump 1.0. And he was just laying it all out for all of us. And I know Alina didn’t manage to make it in time, but I hope that she will listen to it afterwards. I think everybody should go back and listen to that again because there were some very important messages there from him. Now, General Kellogg does know about the Russians and how they negotiate. He’s been around that block many, many times. And, you know, I think if General Breedlove was, you know, listening to this as well, and Former Minister Klimkin—Ambassador Klimkin, you know, I’m sure they’ll have some comments, particularly from the military perspective and from the on the ground in Ukraine. But I wouldn’t then, you know, attribute the views of General Kellogg, his analysis, to everybody else on the team around President Trump, because I don’t think everybody else there, including, with all due respect to Special Envoy Witkoff, have got that same experience. And I can see Angela Stent here in the audience. And Angela’s often commented in the same way that Alina did, about, you know, the danger of giving carrots to the Russians. Depending on the texture of the carrots, they’ll either eat them or they’ll take them and hit you over the head with them. (Laughter.) And I think that that’s kind of, you know, one of the risks that we’re seeing at the moment, because what I’ve seen coming back in some of the pronouncements—again, not from General Kellogg but from some of the statements from Special Envoy Witkoff and others—is that they’ve taken completely on board both the Russian talking points and the Russian positions. I mean, earlier was the question—Margaret Brennan tried to get to this, other people did from the audience—and the question was asking about, what was the term sheet, you know, from the Russians. I think we can see very clearly. First of all, “bilateral irritant” that was mentioned in one of the announcements is Russian code for absolutely every single thing that they’re angry with the United States about. So it’s not bilateral irritants from the United States’ point of view, because we mostly don’t pay attention to some of these issues. But it’s all of the—kind of the Russian positions. When General Kellogg, you know, was talking about the Ukrainian term sheets, I think the Ukrainians have been pretty consistent. Everything is a loss to Ukraine. Let’s be clear about this. Every single thing that Ukraine is having to negotiate with is a loss. Every single thing. Every single thing is a concession because they’re the country that was invaded. And the Russians have made it very clear, which was also laid out in some of the discussion, that they want territory that they currently do not control. So is the concession from the Russians going to be that they’ll only take parts of Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, or Donetsk, Luhansk that they currently don’t control, and then they won’t go further? That would be, you know, not much of a concession, from the Ukrainian point of view. Every single thing that Ukrainians are being asked to do is to concede. Now, I also understand from listening to General Kellogg very carefully—look, again, I just want to say, we should all be very grateful that he’s laid all of this out. It was very clear. That the Ukrainians obviously missed a beat because something was completely lost in translation. And, again, I think Zelensky made a fatal error by not having everything translated. And my advice from, you know, basically being in the administration, or any administration—all the people here who’ve worked in Foreign Service—would be: Do not negotiate, have a discussion, anything, that is not in your native language, no matter how you speak it. I say the same to Macron. If I was the Brits, I would have somebody translate from British to American all the time as well—(laughter)—because sometimes things are lost as well, just to be very clear. And I know that, you know, Prime Minister Starmer was already here, and President Trump loved his accent. But have, you know, your American interpreter, you know, to be—because things are lost all the time. And I think that what Zelensky didn’t understand that he was being offered a treaty of sorts. That only actually occurred to me as I was listening to General Kellogg, because President Trump doesn’t abide by any of the contracts or treaties that were signed by any previous government. And when Zelensky said to President Trump—and I watched, actually, that press conference five times to try to kind of figure out where things went wrong. There were multiple points, but one of them was when President Zelensky pointed to your president, he kept saying to President Trump, who already signed agreements—either Obama or Biden. And President Trump cast those aside. What President Trump was actually telling Zelensky is, you’re signing something with me. This will be the only thing that you’re signing, a basic exchange of letters, but it’s kind of a treaty of sorts. President Trump doesn’t care about the Budapest Memorandum from 1994. He wasn’t there. He doesn’t care about any of the other commitments or recognitions of Ukraine that have been made, or U.N. resolutions, because they weren’t made by him. And up until this point there’s been no agreement between Ukraine and President Trump. And that’s what we were being told. And I had a bit of a eureka moment sitting at the back when I kind of realized that that was the case. And I don’t think that President Zelensky understood that, because, again, his English is not that good. I mean, even, you know, kind of, for those of us English speakers, we’re not always understanding the import because we don’t fully understand, as General Kellogg does. Because remember, General Kellogg has been with President Trump from the very beginning, from his first campaign. He understands him better than anyone. He’s still there with him. Other people don’t understand that in exactly the same way. And you have to have different levels of interpretation. What does President Trump himself mean, and what does the actual translation of the words mean? It’s the context and the content. And that’s why I would kind of go back to your initial question, is I—with all due respect to Special Envoy Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and everybody else who went there—without any interpretation or context they have no clue what the Russians are actually talking to them about. Their interpretation is coming from directly speaking to Ushakov, Lavrov, and Kirill Dmitriev, who all speak excellent English, and who have been around this block forever, and who completely understand who they are, how they interact in their system, how the other system interacts. Remember, Kirill Dmitriev was at Harvard. He’s worked for a whole host of—Goldman Sachs, all kinds of other, you know, kind of Western entities. He knows exactly who he is, who he’s talking on behalf of, how far he can go. And his English is impeccable. And so I think, you know, unfortunately—and this is what the Russians are telling us—I mean, if you look, as Alina is doing, at the Russian interpretation of all of this, you know, they’re being quite scathing. We haven’t even got the junior varsity on the team here. We’ve got the—you know, the intermural, or basically the pickup game. And they are thinking right now that they can manipulate this. Now, General Kellogg is saying, we’ll see when we get there. But, you know, at this point the United States is going out of the door with the Russians on their side of the table, not just reaching that point. And General Kellogg himself understands this, but I’m not so sure that the other people around him do.

Liana Fix’s Transition to Pavlo Klimkin

Liana Fix: That’s a very helpful analysis, Fiona, of both the speech of General Kellogg but also the past meetings. Let me turn now to Pavlo Klimkin. Thanks so much for joining us for this discussion. There has been some hope, from a Ukrainian perspective, that there could be a reset in U.S.-Ukraine relations after this meeting in the White House. Now it seems—and we’ve heard this again from General Kellogg this morning, that it is unclear how any reset would look like, that some of the negotiation levers that the administration sees it has towards Ukraine will be kept in their hands for longer period of time to try to use them not only for the economic partnership agreement or the minerals deal, but potentially also for other concessions that they want to see from the Ukrainian side. What is Ukraine’s strategy to react to that? And I know it’s tough to develop a strategy under such high pressure, but what would you recommend?

Pavlo Klimkin’s Response

Pavlo Klimkin: Good afternoon from Kyiv. We have to develop our strategy. And we have to get an answer. But if you talk to Ukrainians—and, I mean, not only in Kyiv, and I’ve been driving a lot around the country, it’s a sort of emotional shock for many, many people because, firstly, many welcomed the idea of peace through strength. But now people see a lot of strengths towards Ukraine and basically no strength towards the Russians. So someone should have, you know, exchanged the baskets with carrots and something else. It’s basically the sense if you’re not in Kyiv, if you just talk to people. The second point, which worries me even more, it’s a kind of focus on eventual NATO expansion as a fundamental origin of that. And Putin has been talking about the origins. And it’s a fundamentally flawed understanding why the war is like that, and why the war had started. The reason for that is that anybody in Russia and anybody in the Russian leadership fundamentally reject the mere fact that Ukraine is there. Ukrainian history, Ukrainian language, Ukrainian statehood—basically everything. And in 2014, when the invasion into the Crimea started, we were constitutionally a sort of non-bloc country.

Pavlo Klimkin’s Continued Response

Pavlo Klimkin: It’s really important to understand because the fundamental reason for that is that Russia sees us as a kind of ill-fated role, Russia and us as Russians. So if you ask an AI app what to do if you need to eliminate this order, you get your answer. So if you ask a wrong question, and if you mention a set of wrong origins, you are fundamentally nowhere. And I’m afraid it’s partly what’s happening now. Third point, we clearly understand that we need our European allies on our side. We need a strategy, a common strategy with them, because there is no way European security or European security architecture, but also by definition European security, can be there without Ukraine. Unfortunately, this point is coming down into the minds of many European politicians and also militaries, but not really into European societies. There is a clear asymmetry here. But what the new U.S. administration has already achieved is actually the Chinese talking directly to the Europeans and saying, yeah, of course, you should be at the table. Of course, Europe is important. So the whole geopolitics now are changing. In our way, we are, of course, ready to show again that we need our allies. We are ready to enter into difficult negotiations, but not at our expense, and not over our head. What fundamentally would not work. Actually, both U.S. and Russia got us wrong in 2022, in the sense of our resilience, in the sense of our emotions, and in the sense of our understanding what is at stake in this war. And we understand that it’s about our existence as Ukrainians. So we are ready to engage in real conversation. Also, it’s a backdrop of these emotional spikes. But now if you talk to Ukrainians, just Ukrainians, not somebody from political classes or so, many people started saying, look, maybe it’s about Europe, and us about part of Europe. But it’s a very dangerous development because it would lead to a total fragmentation of the West and probably the mere question what actually the West is about now. And our strategy in the coming weeks is, of course, to get back with our engagement, to repair what we can repair, and to build a decent conversation. And we are ready for that. But also to engage in every way possible with the Europeans. And we have a European summit now happening in Brussels. A number of ideas there. And it’s about how to include Europe as a fundamental, intrinsic part of the European reality, is how I see it now.

Liana Fix’s Transition to General Breedlove

Liana Fix: That’s very helpful. Thank you. And you mentioned two things which are so important, I think, the European strategy but also the China element in that. And I hope we can come back to that in the Q&A and in the comments section. But, General Breedlove, if I could turn to you on the question of Europe. Europeans have been asked and invited by the Trump administration to take over the security guarantees question in Ukraine, right? So it seems that there is an idea for division of labor, that the United States negotiates the ceasefire and the Europeans secure the ceasefire. Now, Europeans have come to town asking for a backstop for that mission, although it’s unclear what exactly that backstop will look like. General Kellogg has also not specified it this morning. Under these conditions, would you recommend Europeans to go for the security guarantee, to go for a European mission in Ukraine? And what could this look like?

General Philip M. Breedlove’s Response

Philip M. Breedlove: Well, first of all, thank you all for having me. It’s a pleasure to be on stage with these two and with Pavlo as well. And before I go to your question, I just want to pass that, of course, I agree with what Pavlo has said, but I want to violently agree with a few points Alina and Fiona made, about how we’re being perceived in the world at dealing with the two sides of this issue. On one side, we’ve got a criminal aggressor. And in the world’s eye, we’re treating that criminal aggressor with kid gloves. On the other side we have a nation that’s been invaded, clearly the victim. And we seem to be dealing with them with a hammer. And so it’s—I don’t want to resurface all the conversation, but it’s hard for some of us who travel a lot in Europe to be able to sit down with our allies and discuss why this might be happening. And I want to highlight two things. Right out of the gate we have given Russia huge policy wins. For decades and decades, Mr. Putin has wanted to deal with America about Europe without Europe. And we’ve always kept Europe in the middle of the conversation. And we fought hard not to allow Mr. Putin to establish this idea that he is above Europe, and he should be able to do European matters with the American president one on one, whoever the American president is. And we seem to now have caved on that, and that we are now doing business with Mr. Putin on Europe without Europe. And in a similar fashion, since the winter of 2013 and ’14, when I was the SACEUR and Russia first invaded Crimea and then invaded the Donbas, we have all said that we will not deal about Ukraine without Ukraine. And now we are caving on that as well. So before the negotiations even start we have given huge, huge policy concessions to Russia. And I don’t think we’re walking in the door with a strong hand when that’s the way we begin. So I’ll get off of that, and now get to the question you asked me. I just wanted to agree with what both Alina and Fiona had said, in my own words. So, first of all, I applaud what Europe is doing, OK? So forever there has been some—and legitimate, I would add, complaints about how Europe has approached Article 3—not Article 5, but Article 3. Article 3, in a Georgia boy’s words, are that defense begins at home. In other words, these nations need to invest in themselves. Some people use the word wrong. They’re not paying. They don’t pay. They invest. And so these people are now really climbing on the stump and investing in their own militaries and their capabilities. So you can’t even have a conversation about Article 5 if you haven’t got Article 3 right. And I think we’re on our way to getting Article 3 right. Article 4 is also not being taken care of right now because Article 4 says that the United States, as one of the allies—one of the allies—should be sitting at the table consulting with European allies about these matters. When Article 4 is declared, the allies of NATO come together and discuss. We don’t go off and have single conversations with the criminal aggressor about matters Europe. And so if we have Article 3 straight, if we get Article 4 straight, then it’s much easier to talk about what we need to do now. Which is, yes, maybe it’s a good idea that the Europeans are the bulk of the land contribution to what might happen to secure Ukraine’s future. But America has to be a part of that as well. And I think we’ve sort of cleared the air, but early in these conversations one of our seniormost ministers sort of made an intimation that we would not honor our Article 5 if something broke out. We’re telling the Europeans to go there, take care of this problem, and we won’t be with you if a dust up occurs with Russia? I think that’s—we’ve got to clean that up. We need to make a public, demonstrative, clear commitment to Article 5 as an ally in the NATO alliance.

Liana Fix’s Transition to Audience Q&A

Liana Fix: Wonderful. Thank you, General. That has been excellent. First, Alina, do you want to come in with two fingers, and then we will open up for questions or comments from the audience?

Alina Polyakova: No, just a very quick comment to what General Breedlove just laid out on the backstop conversation. I think one of the epiphanies I’ve had recently in conversations with administration officials is that, just like the president sees the world very differently than perhaps many of us in this room, or the Ukrainians, and we need translation, there’s another element to this. Which is that it’s really hit me that he—and probably others around him—do not see Ukraine and NATO as connected issues. Meaning there’s a ceasefire in Ukraine. That’s one issue. And that’s what we’re trying to get to, from the perspective of the president. And then there’s the NATO question, which is completely separate. But of course, in Europeans’ minds these are deeply intertwined, interlinked issues, because of all the reasons that General Breedlove just laid out. We’re going to have a European-led coalition, may not be a full NATO coalition, five, six countries, whatever that looks like, will the U.S. be there to protect and defend those forces in Ukraine, even if it’s not a NATO force? And so in the president’s mind tying NATO, Article 5, collective defense to the ceasefire in Ukraine is completely incomprehensible. So he sees this as completely separate issues. And Europeans do not. So, to your question, I think, that you had posed, Liana, Europeans are coming asking for a backstop but it’s incomprehensible to the president as to why they’re talking about it.

Liana Fix: Hmm. Yeah.

Fiona Hill: I want to do a two-finger to the—(laughter)—because it’s the global dimension of this as well. And I was actually heartened to at least hear General Kellogg, for the first time, frankly, of an administration official, really laying out the global dimensions of this, of China, North Korea, and also Japan being—and Japan, which I was not going to mention Japan, because this is why I’m raising this—and Iran being involved here, because this is important for our other allies—for Japan, and South Korea, and Taiwan, and many other countries out there watching all of this very closely. But I was not heartened by the same issues that Alina is laying out here. When General Kellogg said that for President Trump these have always been before separate, that everybody was trying to keep North Korea, China, and, he said, Iran, and Russia all separately. Well, they’re not separate. They’ve become pretty fused together here. And that counts for Europe as well. You said it. China is an important issue. Well, Europe and Europeans have their own relationship with China. China was the biggest single country investor in Ukraine before the war, and has then sided very consistently with Russia in this conflict. North Korean troops are in Europe. They’re not just in the Kursk region of Russia. They’re fighting in Europe for the first time. I think General Kellogg was absolutely 100 percent right that, are they preparing for something on the Korean Peninsula? South Korea and Japan have to worry about all of that. So these have to be dimensions as well. And South Korea and Japan are watching this and, as I said, Taiwan and others, very closely. And then the Middle East. It was fascinating as well that General Kellogg said we all started getting involved in this with Saudi Arabia because of MBS. Well, yes, because they’re all watching Iran. And they’re watching how this has now become part of the Middle East conflict as well. The fact that meetings are taking place in Saudi Arabia, and in Turkey, and elsewhere just shows how things are really shifting here. So this isn’t just about Ukraine. You can’t just separate it off and then basically push Ukraine out the door, and figure out that you can then deal with this on the same kind of playing field as before.

Liana Fix: Yeah, the global impacts there. General Breedlove, I’m going to pretend that I haven’t seen your two fingers, because I really—(laughter)—which is unfair, because you’re on screen, on Zoom. I know it’s unfair. But I will come back to you when we have first lot of questions, and you can tie in what you wanted to say, because I really want to give our audience the opportunity to ask questions here. We have an audience here in Washington and on Zoom. And I will bring you in. Please identify yourself and also keep your question short. And if you can say to whom this question is directed, all the better. So I’ll take the first question from the room. Over here.

Audience Q&A: Question 1

Q (Alexandra Starr): I’m Alexandra Starr with International Crisis Group. This is a question for Fiona. Why is Trump doing this? (Laughter.) You’ve worked with him for a long time. Well, you’ve had experience with him in the first administration. His comments during that press conference, talking about everything that he and Vladimir Putin had been through together seems to speak to a psychological dimension to this that I’d be very grateful to get your comments on.

Liana Fix: Fiona.

Fiona Hill: Well, look, I think General Kellogg also made some of the things very clear. President Trump is very interested in strength, and not in weakness. And if you go back again to that press conference, I think lots of things were very clear. It’s about respect. Remember, at one point when President Zelensky was asking him about, well, does nothing matter about what Obama or Biden, your presidents—you meaning United States presidents—have committed to in the past? President Trump at that point lost his temper, basically saying don’t compare me with Presidents Obama and Biden. They were weak people. Nobody respected them. Everybody respects me. So it gets back to—you mentioned Helsinki, which is a painful episode, I think, for myself personally, and for many others, where President Trump has always made it very clear that the people who he sees as his peers are the strong men in the world. And that would be Putin. It’s not his staff. It’s certainly not his intelligence advisors or anything like that. It’s people like Vladimir Putin. He respects strength. Now, I think General Breedlove is probably wanting to come in. And I remember actually being on a panel with him sometime before when he said a lot of the strength in Russia is illusory. He commented on the—and you’ll remember this, General Breedlove—on the forces that the Russians had amassed on the border—180,000, 200,000, roughly. And pointed out that this was about the capacity of the Tennessee Volunteers stadium, for example. I think that was one of the ones that you used. I’ve been in that stadium. And when those people basically go out and dissipate across a large area, it’s almost as if there’d be nobody there at all. The strength of Russia at this point is more than it is in actuality. We haven’t mentioned, 870,000 Russian casualties—people killed in action and severely wounded. And I noticed, actually, General Kellogg made no mention of the Russian casualties. He mentioned the Russian—or, it was really Soviet—casualties in World War II, and Ukrainians, Armenians, Georgians, Belarusians, you name it, Central Asians, Kazakhs, and others fought in World War II as Soviet citizens. It wasn’t all Russian casualties. This is a staggering scale of casualties on the part of Russia because that’s what Putin is prepared to pay, the price he’s prepared to pay. So I think in some respects Putin is strong in the sense that he’s willing to preside over a slaughter, which is something that clearly President Trump, and General Kellogg, and others are not, to their credit. But it’s basically a misreading on the part of, I think, President Trump about who Putin is, and the way that Putin thinks about things. President Trump thinks that President Putin respects him. He wants him to respect him. He talks about this all the time. And I think most of us would be, sadly, remiss if we didn’t realize that President Putin is playing that absolutely to the hilt. And that’s very unfortunate. And of course, when President Zelensky tried to point that out, that was another reason that he got bludgeoned in the White House. Anybody who points out an unpleasant message gets absolutely and utterly bludgeoned. And at some point that message will become clear, when President Putin tries to manipulate something. But then I suspect that President Trump will blame other people and not blame President Putin.

Liana Fix: Thank you, Fiona. I’ll give General Breedlove the opportunity to also quickly come in on that question.

Philip M. Breedlove: So I want to get to that two-finger I raised before as well.

Liana Fix: That you can tie into. (Laughs.)

Philip M. Breedlove: Many of us remember when we were young, our parents said: People don’t care what you say. They care what you do. I’m often asked, what is our policy towards North Korea? Or what is our policy China-Taiwan? Or what is our policy about Iran? And I point out to them that these things are well stated. You can do a simple Google search and you will see that policy. But then I make them angry because I say, none of that really matters because people don’t care what you say. They care what you do. Our North Korea policy, our Iran policy, our Russia, China-Taiwan—all the policies in the world are now really being written every day in Ukraine. The world is watching what we do towards our commitments to Europe and Ukraine, about European security. So you can have all those other things written you want, but people are watching what we do. It’s an interesting point that Fiona brings up about casualties and costs. I believe right now that Russia needs a ceasefire worse than anybody. They need it worse than anybody. They’re backing up in the last two days in the Donbas. And they’re throwing bodies at Kursk in an amazing way. They have now asked North Korea twice to send soldiers to help them recapture sovereign Russian land, OK? So twice now they are asking North Korea to help them retake Russian land. That should tell you a lot about the state of the Russian army. They desperately need a ceasefire. And they want us to guarantee that ceasefire via these agreements, so that they can refit, rebuild. It’s going to take them three, four, maybe even five years to get really ready again, because their army has been decimated so badly. But they’ll—unless they run into something hard, unless the bayonet runs into something hard, they will be back.

Liana Fix: Thank you, General. I think we now have a question—or, we take another one from the room. So the lady over here.

Audience Q&A: Question 2

Q (Christina Segal-Knowles): Thank you. Christina Segal-Knowles, former National Security Council. I was interested in taking conversation back to the China dimension. I think we heard from General Breedlove that he sees connections here, but then when you turn to his comments on how are they putting pressure on Russia he talked about, for example, sanctioning the shadow fleet. China has clearly underwritten the Russian war effort, both through supply of materials and also because it is the purchaser, and increasingly the major purchaser, of Russian oil, keeping the economy afloat. I wondered, how should we think about—is it possible to bring about a lasting peace deal without a Chinese dimension? Is it possible to put maximum pressure on Russia without having China at the table, or in the conversation? And how should we think about the strategy in that context?

Liana Fix: I would—thank you so much. I would like to give this question to Pavlo Klimkin, because I think it would be particularly interesting to have an answer from the Ukrainian perspective there, how you see and Ukraine sees the China dimension. Because I think there has been partly an ambiguous policy towards China from Ukraine’s perspective throughout this war.

Pavlo Klimkin: China was and is helpful to Russia in supplying basically everything beyond lethal stuff. But I also believe the Chinese are not worried on Russia being eventually off hook, because they believe the level of dependence—and not just trade dependence, because Russia has 31 percent of export to China—39 percent of export and 31 percent of import. But in the sense of technology it’s basically a real dependency now. But even if you go to a normal Russian land bridge, in a Russian town in the middle of nowhere, you can get now a deposit in Chinese currency. It’s something fundamentally different. But the Chinese will be playing and are playing extremely smart towards Europe, now going towards Europe and saying, look, guys, see? I mean U.S. is not reliable anymore. And with us, you have reliability. You have trade reliability. You have security. You have all kind of dimensions around Eurasia. Why not just start elevating our partnership? And the Chinese are also smart, understanding their possibilities and being engaged for the first time ever in their history in talking about European security, about Ukraine, or about everything else. And not just talking, with all kind of their initiatives, but probably being present. Not at the level of troops or so but probably monitors. And the Chinese present at higher scale in the Western Balkans. Lukashenko is also under the umbrella. And probably they are instrumental, in the sense of delivering on his independence. So Ukraine would be extremely important for them, in the sense of understanding their future presence. So if they are ready to elevate their engagement with Europe, and now they feel the moment, if they are able to elevate their presence in Central and Eastern Europe, they are in a fundamentally different position in Eurasia. So I believe the Chinese will try to use this chance. The Chinese understand that if we go towards the West, it’s about the West to define what is possible and not possible in the sense of our security. So for them to be present in the European security is something fundamentally they would be willing to go for. So it’s the real moment for the Chinese. And I believe they will use this opportunity at full speed. And last point, who could have imagined us and North Koreans fighting in the Russian Kursk region three years ago? It was something totally mind-blowing. The Chinese clearly understand that security is now—I mean, can’t be seen in fundamentally geographical terms. They see it globally. And for them, it’s exactly the moment. But it’s also about the U.S. credibility. We have now four areas where Russia would push to restrain our sovereignty. It’s about territory. It’s about our potential to defend ourselves. It’s about our military forces and technologies. It’s about our future choice, NATO and the EU, but also how the future Ukraine should look like, in the sense of what kind of Ukraine. So in this sense, it’s also a moment where the Chinese would see the results of these negotiations as a fundamental weakness or strengths, in the sense of directions. And the Chinese will use it fully. I mean, believe me, they are good in analysis and they are good in feeling that the moment is there. There is a fundamental concept of the Chinese qi energy. It’s a kind of if you feel this moment or not. And I believe they do.

Liana Fix: (Laughs.) Thank you. And let’s just add to that that, in some European capitals, there certainly is a temptation to use China as a hedge against the potential negative consequences, tariffs towards Europe, by the Trump administration. Let’s take one more question from the virtual room, from Zoom.

Audience Q&A: Question 3 (Virtual)

Operator: We’ll take our next question from Ambassador Peter Galbraith.

Q (Peter Galbraith): Thank you. I want to—this has been terrific. And, Fiona, I especially appreciate your comments about negotiating in language, having done that in the Balkans in the 1990s. It’s a huge question. But I’ll preface this by saying we’re seeing very radical things from the Trump administration domestically—Elon Musk, DOGE, and so on. And therefore I wonder, General Breedlove, whether what we are seeing are actually concessions or a reorientation of U.S. foreign policy to an alliance of the strong, and where Trump can get what he wants—namely, to be part of the nexus of Russia, North Korea—you remember all the talk about the love letter from Kim Jong-un—and Iran, noting that at the time he applied maximum pressure on Iran he said he regretted doing it, or he had reservations about doing it. And the Russians recently have been saying they’d like to patch things up between the U.S. and Iran. At the same time as he’s talking about—he’s repeatedly critical of NATO, talked about pulling out of it. And possibly getting into a conflict with Europe if he, in fact, goes ahead and uses military force to seize Greenland. And perhaps he would even see letting Russia have what it wants in Ukraine as a quid pro quo for letting him take Greenland. I know it’s radical. We live in radical times.

Liana Fix: Thank you. Yeah, so let me boil down the question too is this tactics in negotiations, or is there a strategy behind it, a strategic realignment, or reorientation? General Breedlove.

Philip M. Breedlove: So I’ve told a lot of people in Europe that if anybody comes to you and tells you they know what President Trump is thinking, you should put down your pencil and turn off your recording device. And I’ll be the first to say, I cannot tell you what President Trump is thinking here. But observing what’s happening, you used the term, Mr. Ambassador—and thank you for the question—reorientation. I have a much more simplistic view of this. I haven’t read his whole book, but a friend of mine gave me a copy so that I could read chapter six, about how he does negotiations. And when he—things I remember from that chapter is, set an abnormally or unusually high bar so that when you can back away from it you’re seen as a good guy in the negotiation. So I look at a lot of these things, Mr. Ambassador, that you’re talking about, are grenades that have been thrown out on the table. And after they explode, we all see how it sorts out afterwards. So I take everything that is said, these very explosive kind of things that have been said, as just that explosive grenade, and let’s get to the more serious conversation after they clear. This morning I was on another show—I’m sorry—(laughter)—and I got hit with the question that all of a sudden there was a statement that we might want to remove the SACEUR from being an American officer. And I said, having been the SACEUR, I have some ideas about that. But I told them, I said: Listen, we need to let the dust settle. This could be Russian disinformation. When you see something that out of orbit, you should really just take the time to let the dust settle.

Fiona Hill: Liana, could I just say one quick thing about this? Because I do actually agree with General Breedlove that there’s a lot of grenade throwing here, cluster bombs actually more than just grenades. (Laughter.) And we can think of some other additions to the end of cluster as well—(laughter)—which is a result of all of this. But I think the problem is that other people do take it as a reorientation. And what we’re seeing now is our allies and our not-so-allies, adversaries and others, adjusting to this, just like the conversation about China. And other people have agency here. It’s not just one guy and one guy’s thoughts. First of all, there are 330 million Americans. But there are 550 million Europeans. And there are eight billion people on the planet who are all making, if they’ve got some information here, their own decisions and their own analyses about what is happening and how it affects them. So once you’ve blown things up you can’t necessarily put them back together again. And you can’t backtrack often from some of the positions that you’ve put out there. Because, I mean, the Russians are already acting accordingly, and lots of other people are as well.

Liana Fix: Mmm hmm. Great. Thank you, Fiona. We’ll take one more question from the room and one more question from online.

Audience Q&A: Question 4

Q (Benjamin Schmitt): Thank you. Benjamin Schmitt, University of Pennsylvania. I just want to make a couple of points on the sanctions discussion that we heard earlier from General Kellogg. He’s mentioning that we put a maximum pressure campaign through designation of hulls of Russian shadow fleet vessels. Yet, as he said himself, the enforcement has been lacking. I think that’s ongoing, but at the same time we’re also seeing what I think is to the rest of your points on a potential strategic realignment with the Russian Federation, when we see that there’s been notions that Trump has actually sent his envoy, Richard Grenell, to Switzerland a number of times to try to negotiate a return of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany, which is ludicrous. And there cannot be a return to business as usual in energy because, again, these—you know, we’re talking a lot—obviously, this is a Ukraine forum. But the Russian Federation is a malign actor well beyond Ukraine. There is active and ongoing sabotage operations, subsea cable cuts, subsea pipeline incidents, assassinations, all of these sort of things going on across the West that do, as President Zelensky said, come back and impact us here in the United States as well. So what can we do to kind of head off this strategic realignment? I don’t think there’s any chance that we will actually have a, quote/unquote, “reverse Nixon” and peel Russia to our side against China. I think they’ll just pocket the win and move on. But any thoughts on this, and how we can actually reorient ourselves to push back on this?

Liana Fix: Thank you so much. This has been reported about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, by the German Bild-Zeitung, which Grenell so far has denied. But I would like to give the question of sanctions to you, Alina, because there’s—and add one more, if I may, to your plate. (Laughs.) First of all, how much more could be done on sanctions with Russia? You have done some proposals on that. But also, could you comment on the Russian frozen assets? It almost seemed like General Kellogg in his presentation this morning was implicitly supportive of the European position to use the Russian frozen assets as leverage for Russia to adhere to a ceasefire. And to say, we will not take them now, but if you break a ceasefire then we take them? Which has been criticized by some economists, among others Irina Bukova, as too weak of a position. I would love to hear your views on that.

Alina Polyakova: No, thanks for that. I think I would just frame what you asked about sanctions, what can be done there, we haven’t used the full force of our sanctions abilities and enforcement abilities, as Ben just said. Certainly in the Russian energy sector, but also on the broader financial sector. The Biden administration, on its way out through executive order did more of that. Why they waited until the very last minute, I don’t know. But there’s still room for more. I think the question, to my mind, is how are we going to enforce all this when we’re also at the same time firing a lot of people that work on that? Because that’s a whole machinery that has to be set up. I don’t—I think Fiona and everyone else in this room knows that very well. So I don’t see much of a direction in which this administration is preparing for that. In fact, they’re preparing for the opposite, to Ben’s point. It seems to provide sanctions relief to the Russians, as part of this ongoing incentivizing with carrots strategy, if you want to call it that. But I think there’s also an interesting element that’s emerged in the conversations here about this perception of weakness and strength, right? And it struck me that there’s a similarity between how this administration is carrying out its current approach to Ukraine and how the Russians are carrying out their approach to us. Meaning that, to Fiona’s point on how President Trump thinks about strength and weakness and respect, if you show weakness, what happens is they just keep pushing more. So I think now that Zelensky has come back to the table, which he has no other choice. He must come back to the table, as Pavlo also said. But what that signaling is that the U.S. is going to keep pushing more and more, because now he’s seen in a weak position. And when you’re in a weak position, that means you have plenty you can still push on, right? So it’s actually going to increase the pressure, not decrease it, in my view. And the Russians are doing the exact same thing. With all of these incentives and carrots that we’re giving them, and will continue to give, they see a massive historic opportunity, in my view. They’re thinking about geopolitics. They’re thinking about restructuring the—and having a seat in the future of Europe’s security order, and beyond that, I think. And they are perceiving us as weak because we’re giving things away, which, to them, signals we’re going to keep pushing to see how far we can get. And they’ve obviously wanted regime change in Ukraine for a long time. And they have gotten us to talk about that now, right? This is their ultimate goal. They can get rid of Zelensky, put in someone that’s going to de facto give them political control of Ukraine. So there’s a strange similarity here, right? Except the Russians perceive us as weak right now, and we are perceiving Ukraine as weak, and both sides are pushing. And I think that’s really, really troubling, when you recognize that. And we’re talking about these geopolitical shifts. And I agree that Beijing sees this in geopolitical terms. The Russians see it in geopolitical terms. And everything that Pavlo said about China’s opportunities is really befuddling, because there’s only one thing that we know this administration has been very clear on, the president has been very clear on, is how much he sees China as the key problem for the United States. Yet, everything we’re doing right now in Ukraine, vis-à-vis our allies, vis-à-vis the economic wars that we’re setting up, it is giving China a massive, historic opportunity to emerge as the major victor of this war, having a foothold in Europe. I think that is something that will happen unless things shift. Really, we’re setting ourselves up for another confrontation from position of weakness, not a position of strength vis-à-vis China. It’s also moving the potential military confrontation over Taiwan closer and closer in time from the Chinese perspective, right? And so that’s the thing we want to avoid, but everything we’re doing is speeding up, I think, Chinese decision making and when they will have the opportunity to grab Taiwan. And that is really befuddling. And it signals to me, again, that certainly probably the president, maybe others in the administration, are not thinking about this in geopolitical, interconnected terms, as we’re talking about it here. They’re seeing very separate issues that, in their minds—in some of their minds, certainly—are probably not connected to each other. Which, of course, is not the reality that we live in. But that is the perception. And so the question is how do we engage and how do we work with this White House, which I think we should, frankly—we should want the president to succeed. Any U.S. president, we should want him to succeed. But there’s a huge understanding gap here in the perception of the world and how certain actions have consequences that is just not coming together.

Liana Fix: Can you also quickly say something about the frozen assets?

Alina Polyakova: Yeah, sorry about that. The frozen assets part, that’s been a befuddling—(laughs)—situation in Europe, in my view. Europe really needs to get money fast. And we’re seeing some of that happening in Germany and at the EU level as well. Those assets are just sitting there. Take them. Use them, now. You need the money. Ukraine needs the money. It’s right there. It’s not going to cost you anything. I think the concerns that are being raised about the implications of this, and is it precedent setting, the concerns raised by some economists that you mentioned, can be addressed. The best paper that I’ve seen on this is—and work on this is by Philip Zelikow, who wrote a paper a couple of weeks ago on the Hoover website that really takes a deep look as to what the situation is right now, because it’s changed in three years. The assets have been moved around. And they’re sitting as cash holdings, which also means they’re not making any money. Like this 300 billion dollars that can be invested and be earning interest rates, and it is not. So there’s also all kinds of questions about the mismanagement of these funds, basically, that could be actually also making money, far more interest rates. But I don’t understand, frankly, why there’s so much opposition in some parts of Europe against the assets. That is low, low hanging fruit.

Liana Fix: And it’s the question of will it be that leverage not to break a ceasefire. We have to come to an end, so I will give Fiona a quick thirty seconds last word here on the panel, because we have another great panel that is coming up in the end next. OK, Pavlo, thirty seconds for Fiona, thirty seconds for Pavlo, and then we will conclude, because we have another great session coming up in just fifteen minutes.

Closing Remarks

Fiona Hill: I think there’s an important point here, because we’re all members of Council on Foreign Relations, one way or another. So we tend to see the world from a foreign policy and a geopolitical perspective. And we heard from General Kellogg earlier this morning that that’s not President Trump—I always make that slip—(laughter)—because sometimes they see the world in the same ways, but very different ways. Because Putin does see it geopolitically, but Trump sees it economically and from a trade perspective. He doesn’t want a war with China over Taiwan. He’d give up Taiwan in a heartbeat for a bigger deal, a trade deal. And that’s essentially what he was telling Zelensky, that he needed to get with the program. I mean, again, it was very clear, from what General Kellogg said that Zelensky made a mistake because Trump sees the world in terms of everybody making some money and everybody getting something out of it. And if there’d been a deal signed on the minerals with the United States, with Trump and Zelensky, then everybody could have made something out of that. That’s what he’s trying to say. And he’ll make a deal with Russia. There’ll be all kinds of economic deals. He did that 1.0, the same kind of thing, looking for deals. And it’s also what he’s looking for with China. So I think we have to just orient ourselves in a different way and realizing that we’re all probably—(laughs)—not on the same page as where Trump is as well. And this explains, getting back to some of these questions, why there’s a disconnect all the time. And he does see this as a big deal between Russia, the United States, and China. That is how he sees the world, the big three sitting down and making deals.

Liana Fix: Yeah. Yeah, let me give just very quickly, Pavlo, the opportunity to say a very few last sentences, and then we will wrap this up. Pavlo.

Pavlo Klimkin: Yeah, one sentence about sanctions. Sanctions are actually quite good. The problem is the implementation. It’s a set of lost opportunities. And now you can forget about any sort of real sanctions in the future towards someone else. You can play with tariffs, but playing with sanctions is over. No credibility. And what is happening with the assets, what Alina has just said, is a kind of joke for many countries, and I know it. In one sentence, about our stakes now. So we are talking about why the Russian aggression against Ukraine had started and has happened. And Putin is talking in his own way about the origins of the war. And if you just want to have a break, so fundamentally in some moment it would backfire. And it would backfire for everyone, in the sense of lost in translation, and would be backfire also in the sense of total loss of credibility. And this is a fundamental law, and the world should understand.

Liana Fix: Thank you, Pavlo. I will—thank you. Thank you so much. Those were very good last words here, but also great lead over to the next session, which will discuss also Ukraine’s economic needs, reconstruction, and so on. So have a coffee break. Thank you so much for our panelists for joining us today. (Applause.) (END)
