==== Introduction and Hosts
Welcome to Free Speech Unmuted. I'm Eugene Volokh, Senior Fellow 资深研究员 at the Hoover Institution at Stanford and Emeritus Law Professor 荣休法律教授 at UCLA Law School. My co-host, Jane Bambauer, is a professor—many decades away from being an Emeritus—at the University of Florida, in the Law School 法学院 and the Journalism 新闻学 Department 部门.


==== New Feature Announcement
Before we get to the substance 实质内容 of our show, I wanted to announce 宣布 a new feature 特色功能. It’s a mailbag 读者来信 feature. If you have questions about free speech, you can go to hoover.org/askunmuted—that’s hoover.org/askunmuted, one word, ‘askunmuted’—and leave us your question. Then we’ll probably periodically 定期地 do an ‘answering user questions’ show. So that’s a new feature. Hope you enjoy it.



==== Topic Introduction: Free Speech and Non-U.S. Citizens
Today we will turn to the question about free speech and aliens 外国人—free speech and people who are not U.S. citizens—and to what extent 在何种程度上 they are protected by the First Amendment 第一修正案.


Yes, we decided to record on this topic today because, in the news cycle 新闻周期 right now, is a controversy 争议 involving a former Columbia 哥伦比亚大学 graduate student 研究生 named Mahmoud Khalil—and a few days ago he was arrested by ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement 美国移民和海关执法局.



==== Case Background: Mahmoud Khalil
The announcement 公告 from DHS 国土安全部 on X—maybe I’ll just read part of it—explained 解释说 that he was arrested because, and here I’m quoting 引用, "Khalil led activities 活动 aligned to Hamas 哈马斯, a designated 指定的 terrorist 恐怖主义 organization 组织." So I think that wording 措辞 might be important: "was later aligned to Hamas."


The background 背景 is that Khalil was frequently 经常地 in the reporting 报道 on—his name was mentioned 提及 in a lot of the reporting about the protests 抗议活动 going on at Columbia University. He served as the—the student groups that were setting up encampments 营地 and making demands 要求 about divestment 撤资 from Israeli 以色列的 companies 公司 and whatnot 等等 used Khalil as their main negotiator 谈判代表.


There was a CNN story around that time where Khalil not only talked about his experience 经验 as the negotiator and what they want and why they had turned down 拒绝 some offers 提议 that other universities had previously 以前 successfully 成功地 used, but he also said that they would not decamp 撤营, even after Columbia University gave them an order 命令 to.


He had mentioned 提及 back last year, in 2024, that he was a little bit nervous 焦虑的；担忧的 being on the forefront 前沿 of the protest movement 运动 because, at the time, he was in the country on a student visa 学生签证.



==== Legal Questions Introduced
We need to understand whether, as a statutory 法律规定的 matter and then also as a constitutional 宪法的 matter, the Trump administration 政府 really can deport 驱逐 someone like Khalil, who has been working quite actively with protest groups 抗议团体 that, in addition to engaging in speech, also engaged in at least some—at least trespass 非法侵入 and maybe some other illegal acts 非法行为 as well.



So, does that set us up well enough, or do you want to add anything?


Well, it sets us up almost too well. So here are these interesting factual 事实的 disputes 争议 about this particular case—or factual accounts 记述 with some factual uncertainties 不确定性. We don’t know for sure, for example, as I understand it, whether the federal government is also saying that he was indeed 确实地 conspiring to commit 共谋犯罪 crimes, and if so, what kind of crimes—yes, they committed trespass, perhaps, or something like that, but maybe even more.


The facts of the case, I think, help illuminate 阐明 what’s going on. But there’s a broader 更广泛的 question that arises for many more people and in various different kinds of ways. So let’s turn briefly 简要地 to this broader question.


==== Statutory Framework 法定框架
Let’s start with the statutes 法规；法令. First of all, the government is, generally speaking 一般来说, entitled 有权 to deport 驱逐出境 people—at least constitutionally entitled to deport people—if they commit crimes.

A citizen, by the way—I used to be an alien 外侨；外国人. I was born in the then-Soviet Union 当时的苏联. I am, thankfully 谢天谢地, a United States citizen. But back before then, if I had been at the tender age of—I think it was 14 when I got citizenship—the tender age of, say, 13, if I had committed a crime—and let’s actually, to make it easier, assume that I was an adult when I committed the crime—it’s possible I might have been deported for that. Certainly, I had no constitutional right to remain in the U.S. so long as I was not a U.S. citizen.

Now that I am a citizen, if I commit a crime—not that I would—but if I were, I could be punished, but I couldn’t be deported. But non-citizens can be, at least consistent with 符合；一致 the Constitution, deported for committing crimes.

Of course, there are also statutory limits 法定限制. Not every single crime—not every time you speed or something like that—would you be deported. And, of course, there are also various procedures that are required—procedures, perhaps, of the sort that are being gone through 经历；通过 right now, having to do with whether, in fact, you’re legally eligible for—whether the government is legally allowed to deport you under the statute.

So there’s this complicated statutory scheme 法定体系 of immigration law 移民法, but as a constitutional matter, people can be deported for committing crimes.

Now, what if somebody is deported solely 仅仅；唯一 because of their speech? So let’s start with the statutory provisions 法定条款.

This is one area where President Trump is not really getting way ahead of Congress the way he is in some areas where there’s a question as to whether he’s entitled to. Here, there is a federal statute 联邦法规—there’s been, for quite a while, a federal statute—which specifically provides that an alien may be excluded 排除；拒绝入境 or deported for endorsing 支持；认可 or espousing 拥护；主张 terrorist activity 恐怖活动 or persuading others to endorse or espouse terrorist activity or support a terrorist organization 恐怖组织.

This is based on speech. It’s not just if you are a terrorist—of course, if you’re a terrorist, you could be excluded and deported. Of course, if you’re actually conspiring 密谋；共谋 with a foreign terrorist organization, you could be excluded or deported based on that crime. And likely, maybe incitement 煽动；激励 too, if you actually, within the bounds of incitement—but here, just endorsing is not any of those things.

This is speech that would be constitutionally protected, generally speaking, for American citizens. But the immigration laws say that if you engage in 参与 such speech, you are excludable 可被排除的—both at the border, you can be not allowed in in the first place, and you can be deported if you engage in such speech.

Am I correct that this statute—the language from this statute that we’re focusing on—came out of the Patriot Act 爱国者法案, which, I think, is also an interesting question?

That’s my vague recollection 模糊的回忆. I have not actually looked into it.

If you look at how terrorist activity is defined, again—and it’s enough for this law that you endorse or espouse it—but if you look at how it’s defined, it’s defined very broadly 广泛地. It’s any activity which is unlawful 违法的 under the laws of the place where it is committed, or which would have been unlawful in the U.S. if it had been committed in the U.S., and which involves hijacking 劫持；劫机, sabotage 破坏；怠工, assassination 暗杀, violent attacks on chiefs of state, and a few other things.

Technically, if somebody were to say, "I think that someone in Russia should shoot Putin, and that’s the way that the war will be over, and things will get better for Russians as well as the Ukrainians," that would be endorsing or espousing terrorist activity—because terrorist activity includes activity that’s unlawful. Shooting Putin is unlawful in Russia—I’m quite sure of that. I’m not an expert in Russian law, but I’m willing to bet on that—and it’s an assassination as well as a violent attack on an internationally protected person.

So this is potentially 潜在地 a broad restriction 广泛的限制 on the speech of aliens.

As a statutory matter, I can’t speak to any particular case because I need to know exactly what the person said, although presumably 据推测 that will come out in these proceedings 诉讼程序；进程 that need to happen before someone is deported. But at least in principle 原则上, many people who spoke out, say, in favor of Hamas or defending Hamas’s actions in Israel—of Hamas’s murder of Israelis—they would be, in fact, excludable, deportable 可被驱逐的 under the statute.

==== Constitutional Uncertainty 宪法不确定性
So that’s the statute. President Trump is acting consistently with 符合；一致 the statute. Are he and the statute consistent with the Constitution? And the answer is, I think the only honest answer is: we don’t know.

You might think, "Why don’t we know?" I mean, after all, modern free speech law is about a century old, more or less. These issues have arisen at various times. You’d think there would be a clear answer in the precedents 先例. Turns out, there’s not.

A few things are clear. The first thing is that, when it comes to criminal punishment and traditional civil liability 民事责任, freedom of speech and of the press is afforded 提供；给予 aliens residing in 定居于；居住于 this country. That’s a 1945 decision that was quite early, again, in modern free speech law.

That actually involved an interesting case involving a labor leader, Harry Bridges, who was being prosecuted 起诉；检举 under state law. It turns out he was an Australian citizen. The question was, "Can he be prosecuted—can the government have extra authority to prosecute him for speech because he’s a foreign citizen?" The Supreme Court said, "No." When it comes to normal law—normal criminal law and normal civil liability—aliens have the same rights as citizens when they’re in the U.S.

By the way, if we’re talking about aliens speaking in foreign countries or foreign organizations speaking in foreign countries, the First Amendment 第一修正案 doesn’t apply. The government, for example, can deny funding in viewpoint-based ways to foreign organizations speaking in foreign countries. That’s just outside the reach, essentially 本质上, of the First Amendment, the Supreme Court has said.

Now, what about entry? What about just coming into the United States in the first place, say, as a tourist? Well, in a case called Kleindienst v. Mandel—a 1972 case involving a Marxist 马克思主义者 academic who was invited to speak, oddly enough 奇怪的是, at Stanford University, which is my employer—Hoover is, of course, a unit of Stanford University—so he was invited. The government said, "No." Now, they had said that he was rejected because he’d violated visa conditions in the past, but the Supreme Court basically said that the government can exclude aliens even based on their speech.

So it can just say, "Look, you know, if you were an American saying these things in America, you’d be free to do that. But just because we have to tolerate 容忍；忍受 our own people like that—our own people with views that we think are very bad, Nazis, Communists, or whatever else—doesn’t mean we have to import them."

Now, can I ask you a question about that one? So Kleindienst came up—longtime listeners might recall 回忆；记起 I was interested in this case when we were thinking about TikTok because that’s an example of where, if we think of the algorithm 算法 as originating in 起源于 China—and just like a Belgian Marxist—but in dicta 附带意见；法官意见, the Court explained that one reason they felt comfortable allowing the visa to be denied was that the listeners who have the interests—who have First Amendment interests—were still getting his message because there was, at the time, a telephone conference where he could deliver his remarks anyways, or something like that.

I take it that Mandel is not completely clear, or it leaves at least some vagueness 模糊；不明确 about, especially when it comes to the interests of others who might want to hear a message. But I think the territoriality 领土性 here really matters, right?

Right. So I think Kleindienst v. Mandel is pretty clear in the power to exclude, which is sort of an essential attribute 属性；特质 of sovereignty 主权—like, we, at our borders, we can say to anybody, "No, we just don’t want you here." But once they’re in—are they in? We’ll get to that.

But I do think you raise a very important question: what about listener interests, right? Even if you were to say, "Well, you know, aliens—they’re not Americans, they’re not protected by the Bill of Rights 权利法案"—again, the Supreme Court has said they are protected, at least as to some things, as to many things—but let’s say we say, "You know, they shouldn’t be protected." Well, there are Americans who may want to hear their views, and the First Amendment protects the rights of listeners as well as of speakers.

But in Kleindienst, the Supreme Court essentially said, "Yes, yes, it does protect the rights of listeners. That’s why we’re taking this argument—the First Amendment argument—quite seriously. But it doesn’t give anyone the right to come into the U.S." So the rights of listeners are important. They make a difference in various kinds of cases, but they will only take you so far 在某种程度上 when it comes to immigration.

And there is sort of a parallel 平行的；类似的 there because the Supreme Court has also said that people who want to go listen and observe in Cuba don’t have a right to travel to Cuba. I think that case and Mandel sort of show that the crossing borders is just treated as a—whether we call it conduct or, in any case, some non-expressive decision that does not, where the First Amendment won’t attach 附着；适用, right?

==== Deportation After Entry 入境后的驱逐
So then we get to this question of: what happens if we do let them in, but then we regret it and we want to kick them out 赶出去? Can we do that again? Can we do that as a constitutional matter? Federal immigration law may limit the government’s power to do that as a statutory matter and may certainly impose 强加；施加 certain procedures, but can—substantively 实质上—Congress say, as it has, "You know, people who espouse 拥护；主张 these particular views can indeed be deported"?

Well, here the rule is unclear. Now, this issue did come before the Court in a case called Harisiades v. Shaughnessy back in 1952, and there the Court did speak about basically nearly unlimited congressional power over deportation. But that came in the section dealing with the argument that deportation violated due process 正当程序.

When it came to the First Amendment argument, the Supreme Court said, "Well, it’s okay to deport him because he’s an active member in the Communist Party 共产党." And at the time—basically, I oversimplify here—but at the time, that was seen as punishable, at least in many respects, even for citizens. I think the law has changed in considerable measure 自那时以来相当大的程度 since then.

But Harisiades, therefore, can be read two ways. One is: the government has unlimited authority in deciding whom to kick out—at least, as a matter—the First Amendment does not constrain 约束；限制 the government in deciding whom to kick out, just as it doesn’t constrain the government in deciding whom to let in.

But another possibility is to say, "No, Harisiades basically applied the then-existing First Amendment rule and said, 'Well, his speech is unprotected, so that’s why he can be kicked out.'" So as a result, things are unclear.

One way of knowing that they’re unclear is that lower courts—like the federal appellate courts 联邦上诉法院, so pretty high, but lower than the Supreme Court—are quite mixed on this.

For example, there was a Ninth Circuit case from 1995—American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee v. Reno—which was reversed by the Supreme Court, but on other grounds 理由；根据, so the Supreme Court did not end up passing judgment on this question—that said, "Look, read properly, Harisiades establishes the deportation grounds are to be judged by the same standard applied to other burdens on First Amendment rights." That’s a quote. So basically saying rules are the same for aliens as they are for citizens.

There’s a Fourth Circuit case from 1985 that ruled the same way.

On the other hand, there is a Ninth Circuit case from 1991 which said that the protection afforded resident aliens by the First Amendment may be limited because the Court has historically afforded Congress great deference 尊重；遵从 in the area of immigration and naturalization 归化.

Here’s a particularly relevant quote because it involved the plaintiff 原告 who’s a lawful permanent resident 合法永久居民: "Although Price is justified in expecting the greatest degree of constitutional protection afforded a non-citizen"—again, because he was a lawful permanent resident, green card holder, certainly not an illegal alien, but also not a temporarily visiting student or something like that—"so although he has the greatest degree of constitutional protection, the protection afforded him certainly is not greater than that of the citizen plaintiffs in Kleindienst"—remember the case we just talked about—"whose claims were rejected."

So essentially it was saying, "Look, the people who wanted to listen to Mandel were American citizens. They lost in Kleindienst. Price will lose here too."

==== Citizenship and Selective Prosecution 公民身份与选择性起诉
And by the way, this raises another question, which is: neither deportation nor initial admission—what about citizenship? Can the government say, "Look, you know, maybe we won’t deport you, but we don’t want you to be voting in our elections. We don’t want you to be playing a role in the governance 治理；管理 of our nation"?

And there, Price suggests that Congress can deny non-citizens citizenship based on speech that would be protected if said by a citizen. Quote: "Naturalization decisions deserve at least as much judicial deference 司法尊重 as do decisions about initial admission"—back again to Kleindienst.

So the answer is unclear.

But there’s one last thing where the answer is at least clearer, and it may resolve some of these cases, although not all of them. In Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee—remember, that’s that Ninth Circuit case I said went up to the Supreme Court, was resolved on other grounds—the Supreme Court did hold that, basically, generally speaking—maybe with a few exceptions, but generally speaking—one thing that non-citizens who are being deported can’t do is raise a selective prosecution claim 选择性起诉主张.

If I’m being prosecuted for some crime, I can say, "Look, the real reason you’re prosecuting me is my speech, and I want the charges dismissed against me because they would not have been filed if it weren’t for my political affiliation 政治派别 or things that I’ve said. It’s constitutionally protected speech. You’re saying you’re prosecuting me for tax evasion 逃税 or whatever else, but really you’re targeting me because of my speech."

Those are hard cases for defendants to win, but in principle, they can win them. Whereas, generally speaking, when it comes to immigration decisions, the Supreme Court clearly said you can’t raise the selective prosecution.

Maybe there’s an exception where the government basically admits to selective prosecution—well, that’s what I was just going to ask—because in these Truth Social posts, right, suggest that we know what the reasoning is here, okay?

Right. So, but at least in many situations where the person says, "Well, I think the real reason you’re going after me is because I participated in these demonstrations. You’re saying it’s because I was involved in trespass 非法侵入 or some such, but really the reason is you didn’t like the message of the demonstration"—well, the Supreme Court’s decision makes clear that that argument isn’t going to fly 行得通；获得接受.

But returning to the broader point: what if the government says, "No, no, no, we want to stress that the reason we are going after you—in fact, the only thing we’re going after you—let’s assume the government says—is you’re endorsing or espousing foreign terrorist activity"? What the First Amendment rule about that is—we just don’t know, at least don’t know for sure.

==== Application to Khalil’s Case 应用于哈利勒的案例
Very interesting. And just to be clear, we do not know that Khalil specifically said or did anything that actually endorses the Hamas attacks. Just to be—at least the quotes that I’ve seen are ones where he has said that the student protesters should not leave campus until Columbia divests 撤资, and I think that’s not—that doesn’t quite fit the even the broad definition of endorsing or espousing terrorist activity.

But, like you said, we will learn more about what he has said and done, right?

By the way, I should mention—though a part I may have omitted 省略；遗漏 when I read the statute at the outset 开始时 because it’s a little technical, but might be relevant here—the statute also makes excludable and deportable people who threaten, attempt, or conspire 密谋；共谋 to endorse or espouse terrorist activity.

So if I’m involved in a conspiracy with other people where they’re the ones who are endorsing or espousing terrorist activity, but I am deliberately 故意地 helping them in various ways with the aim of promoting their endorsement or espousal of terrorist activity, that would presumably 据推测 be conspiracy to do that and would itself be deportable or excludable—again, if I were an alien, a status that I have, thankfully, left far in the past.

==== Personal Anecdote 个人轶事
By the way, I should tell people, just to acknowledge 承认；确认 what a foreign and suspect character I am—you know, every so often 时不时 I have to, for bar admission 律师资格考试, indicate 表明；指出—depends on the jurisdiction 司法管辖区—but I may have to indicate all the names I have ever been known under. And in addition to Eugene Volokh, I have to say "Yevgeny Volokh" because, on the visa to get into the U.S., I distinctly 清楚地 remember, my Russian name is Yevgeny—which is the Russian version of Eugene—but it was just transliterated 音译 rather than translated.

Then, thankfully, my parents realized that life in America would be easier as "Eugene" if you come up with 提出；想出 a name that at least everybody knows roughly how to spell and how to pronounce, more or less. But in any case—this is why my Yakowitz family went by "Yorks" for a long time.

So yes, if only my parents had done the same with my last name—although then again, you know, there are advantages to being odd. It sort of becomes a bit of a trademark 商标；特征.

In any event 无论如何, so as citizens, we have all of these rights. As an alien, I had some of those rights—many of the free speech rights—but maybe not the most important one of all, which is the right not to be deported for the things that I say, maybe.

But one of the most important rights of all—well, I think in your case, it probably is the most important, given where your career wound up 结束；结果如何, right?

Well, and given where I would have been deported to—that too, yes.

==== Follow-Up Questions 后续问题
Okay, so I have two follow-up questions. One is that I saw, in some of the reporting around this controversy 争议, I saw at least one commentary say that it’s not clear whether Khalil, through the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union 美国公民自由联盟), will be able to raise a First Amendment challenge before removal proceedings 驱逐程序 have finished, or at least been initiated 开始；发起. Is that correct? I mean, I think this was a matter of standing 诉讼资格. That seems to me hard to believe, given that there’s been an arrest, but—right?

It seems odd to me, but I should say, immigration law is a highly, highly technical field. I’m comfortable that I know the First Amendment rules—such as they are. As we see, all I may know is we know very little, having to do with immigration law. Also, the statute that I read—I’m familiar with—but the exact procedures about what you raise and when, and there are interesting questions about where physically, in what district—in what federal district 联邦地区—these claims have to be made—all of these are important questions to which I do not know the answer.

Okay, so then the second question is the policy question. So, do you think this is a good idea? Even if, you know, I think, given past episodes, I think we’re both on the record as being, I think, somewhat skeptical 怀疑的 of the wisdom of some of these student protest movements, right? Is it a good idea to—whether we’re talking about visa holders or green card holders—is it a good idea for the government to selectively revoke 撤销；取消 access to American soil based on protest activity?

==== Policy Discussion 政策讨论
No, I do not. I’m a big believer in free speech as an important—in fact, necessary—condition of the search for truth, of the marketplace of ideas 思想市场, of democratic self-government 民主自治. Now, of course, aliens, by definition, are not themselves direct participants in democratic self-government, but they do talk to American citizens, and American citizens may learn important things from them.

Sometimes they may be persuaded by them. Sometimes one of the things they may learn is, "Wow, these people really hold these ideas, which I think are awful ideas, but this gives me a new perspective 观点；视角 on what’s happening on campuses, what’s happening in the world, and what’s happening in various political corners of the United States." It’s useful information to know.

So for all of these reasons, being able to hear what non-citizens have to say is quite important—especially because about 96% of the world, more or less, consists of people who are not Americans. It’s a big, big world out there, and it’s useful to be able to hear what foreigners—people who maybe just very recently lived in a foreign country, maybe about to return to a foreign country, or maybe not, in the case of lawful permanent residents—but how they see the world. That may help influence our judgment about Americans, about what makes sense for our country to do.

So I believe in all these things, and the flip side 另一方面 of that is, I think it’s important to the university that people be free to talk about these things. And when you see your friends and your classmates being chilled in their speech because they say, "I don’t want to get deported," it creates a chilling effect 寒蝉效应 on everybody.

I mean, you might say, "Well, I don’t have to worry about getting deported," but still, you’re getting—it becomes less a community of people who really are genuinely 真正地 free to express themselves and free to talk about all sorts of issues—like, for example, even espousing terrorist activity.

I imagine there are people who have, at various times in their lives—especially when they’re younger—been quite open to political violence, especially overseas. Remember, this is—we’re talking about espousing foreign terrorist activity and violence in foreign countries—may have been, "Yes, absolutely, more revolution, more war, more whatever," and then eventually they realized that was a mistake. And it was useful for me to talk it over with people, to recognize it’s a mistake.

So, for all these reasons, I generally think that there ought not be these kinds of restrictions on non-citizens any more than on citizens.

Now, you might try to distinguish 区分；辨别 situations where people are saying things that suggest that they’re actually a hazard 危害；危险 to Americans in America. So you can imagine the government coming in and saying, "Look, this person is saying things that make us think that he’s going to try to bomb synagogues 犹太教堂 or bomb mosques 清真寺 or bomb government buildings or whatever else in America. We just want to kick him out just so he’s no longer a danger to us." You can imagine possibly having a different kind of argument as to that—although even there, I would be quite skeptical of that kind of deportation.

But it seems pretty clear that both the statute—which, remember, focuses on endorsement of terrorist activity, the great bulk of which is overseas terrorist activity—that so it seems to me that both the statute and the administration right now aren’t looking at a narrow rationale 理由；依据. They’re looking at the broader rationale: "Again, just because we have to allow Americans to say these awful things doesn’t mean we have to import foreigners who are going to say that."

But I think, ultimately 最终, that’s counterproductive 适得其反的. I think it’s bad for American public debate 公共辩论, and I think it’s bad for serious, thoughtful discussions at American universities. Because, remember, this doesn’t just apply to people chanting slogans in encampments 营地—including often illegal encampments—it also applies to—somebody could be deported under the statute for having a serious, thoughtful conversation about hope of foreign political violence.

Yeah, writing a polite op-ed 专栏文章 in the student newspaper—that’s the thing.

Yeah, I mean, so I agree with all of those things. I do also want to highlight 强调；突出 that in addition to the free speech theory, which you and I both are firmly committed to, it also is very counterproductive—I think is the word you used.

Because, you know, most people were actually pretty annoyed by these student protests and the demands, and now we have—you know, now Khalil is looking quite sympathetic 同情的；支持的, especially with a baby on the way 即将来临. And you have a bunch of lawyers coming in trying to parse 解析；分析 the difference between supporting terrorism versus being against Israeli government decisions as a policy matter, or, you know—and so that’s just—I think, even if you were completely instrumental 工具性的 and were willing to use whatever government power you have to achieve the ends you want—which neither of us are—but even if you were, this would be a really bad call 判断；决定, even on even to achieve the short-term ends that Donald Trump seems to want.

So, yeah, I’m inclined to 倾向于 say that that’s so—especially given that the Trump administration is billing itself as protecting free speech and faulting Europeans for unduly 过分地 restricting speech. I mean, I take it that some people from the administration may say, "Yeah, we mean the speech of Americans. We’re about America First, and yeah, sure, we don’t care as much about the speech of foreigners—especially who come here as visitors to our country and then violate our rules." So, you know, perhaps they could defend themselves this way politically.

I’ve been so poor in my predictions of what’s going to play well and what won’t politically in American politics that I can’t speak with great confidence. But I’m inclined to tend to agree with you that this is putting people who express these views—many of whom really should be condemned 谴责；指责 for those views—it’s making them, if not quite free speech martyrs 烈士, but at least putting them in a more positive light.

But again, I just can’t say I’m completely certain at how this is going to play in Peoria or how it’s going to play in Portugal.

==== Conclusion 结论
Very good. All right, well, we’ll see how it plays out 发展；结果如何 in the courts of New York City, I guess, first.

Well, that’s a good question. So, just to be clear—friendly amendment 友好的修正—of the federal courts, somewhere, maybe in New York. But this is one of the questions, as I understand it, is whether it’s going to be in the federal courts in New York or—I’ve heard talk about in Louisiana.

Louisiana, that’s right. That’s right.

The one thing that I can say with considerable confidence is, if we expect this case to give us the precedent 先例, we could be waiting a long time. Our justice system is generally not super fast, but the immigration system is extra complicated, with a lot of layers of review. Maybe at some point, the Supreme Court is going to resolve some of these questions, but it may take a while.

So, Jane, thank you very much, as always. Such a delightful conversation, and we look forward to talking with the rest of you folks in a few weeks.

Thanks.

==== Topic Introduction: Free Speech and Non-U.S. Citizens
今天，我们将讨论自由言论和外国人之间的问题——自由言论和非美国公民之间的关系——以及这些人到底在多大程度上受到《第一修正案》的保护。

是的，我们今天决定讨论这个话题，因为当前新闻周期中有一场争议，涉及到一位前哥伦比亚大学研究生，名叫马哈茂德·哈利尔——几天前他被"美国移民与海关执法局"（ICE）逮捕。

==== Case Background: Mahmoud Khalil
美国国土安全部在X平台上的公告——也许我来读一部分——解释说，他之所以被逮捕，是因为，引用一句话，“哈利尔主导了与哈马斯有关的活动，哈马斯是一个被指定为恐怖组织的组织。”我认为这句话很重要：“后来与哈马斯有关联。”

背景是，哈利勒在关于哥伦比亚大学抗议活动的报道中频繁出现——他的名字被多次提及。他担任了学生团体的主要谈判代表，这些团体在校园内设立营地，并要求从以色列公司撤资等。

当时有一篇CNN的报道，哈利勒不仅谈到了他作为谈判代表的经历以及他们的诉求，还提到他们拒绝了其他大学此前成功使用的一些提议。他还表示，即使哥伦比亚大学命令他们撤离，他们也不会离开营地。

他在2024年提到，他有点紧张站在抗议运动的前线，因为当时他是以"学生签证"的身份在美国。

现在情况有点复杂。在逮捕期间，特朗普政府曾暗示他仍然是"签证持有者"——至少在他们的一些推文中是这么说的。但现在，根据哈利勒在美国公民自由联盟（ACLU）的律师的说法，他已经成为"绿卡持有者"。所以他在2024年12月毕业，现在是"永久居民"。他结婚了，很快将迎来一个孩子。这是他的居住身份。

==== Legal Questions Introduced
我们需要了解，无论是从"法定角度"还是"宪法角度"，特朗普政府是否真的可以驱逐像哈利勒这样的人，他一直积极参与抗议团体，除了发表言论外，还参与了至少一些非法行为——比如非法侵入。

所以，这样的背景是否足够，或者你还有什么要补充的？

嗯，背景几乎太充分了。所以这里有一些关于这个案件的有趣的事实争议——或者说是带有一些不确定性的描述。例如，据我所知，我们不确定联邦政府是否也在说, 他确实在共谋犯罪，如果是的话，是什么样的犯罪——是的，他们可能犯了非法侵入，或者类似的事情，但也许还有更多。

我认为案件的事实, 有助于阐明正在发生的事情。但还有一个更广泛的问题，涉及更多的人和不同的情况。所以让我们简要讨论一下这个更广泛的问题。


==== Statutory Framework
我们从法律条文开始。首先，政府通常有权"驱逐人"——至少在宪法上，有权驱逐那些犯了罪的人。

顺便说一下，公民——我曾是外籍人士。我出生在前苏联。幸运的是，我现在是美国公民。但在那之前，如果我在——我认为我大约14岁时获得美国国籍——假设我在13岁时犯了罪——让我们假设，*我在犯了罪时是成年人——那我可能会因为这个罪行被驱逐。显然，只要我不是美国公民，我没有宪法上的权利留在美国。*

*现在我是美国公民了，如果我犯了罪*——不是说我会，但如果我犯了——我会受到惩罚，但**不会被驱逐。**但是，*"非公民"如果犯了罪，至少在宪法允许的范围内，是可以被驱逐的。*

当然，法律也有一些限制。并不是每项犯罪——比如超速——都会导致驱逐。此外，还有一些程序要求——比如现在正在进行的程序，涉及政府是否在法律上有权根据法律条文驱逐你。

所以，移民法有一个复杂的法定框架，但作为宪法问题，因犯罪而被驱逐, 是可以的。

那么，如果某人仅仅因为"言论"而被驱逐呢？我们先从法律条文讲起。

这是特朗普总统在某些领域并没有走得比国会更远的一个例子，**在那些领域他是否有权力, 仍有争议。**在这里，*有一部联邦法——这部法律已经存在一段时间——明确规定: 外籍人士因支持或提倡恐怖活动，或劝说他人支持或提倡恐怖活动, 或支持恐怖组织，可以被排除或驱逐。*

**这是基于"言论"的。**如果你是恐怖分子——当然，**如果你是恐怖分子，你可以被排除和驱逐。**当然，**如果你确实与外国恐怖组织共谋，你可以基于那项犯罪, 被排除或驱逐。**可能还包括煽动，如果你确实在"煽动"的范围内——但这里，仅仅是"支持"的话还并不属于这些行为。

*这种言论对美国公民来说通常是受宪法保护的。但移民法规定，如果你发表这样的言论，你可能会被排除——不仅在边境时不被允许入境，而且如果你发表这样的言论，你可能会被驱逐。*


我没记错的话，这项法律——我们关注的**这一部分语言——来源于《爱国者法案》**，我认为这也是一个有趣的问题？

这是我模糊的记忆。我实际上没有深入研究过。

*如果你"看恐怖活动"的定义*——再强调一下，支持或提倡恐怖活动就足够了——但如果你看它是如何定义的，**它的定义非常广泛。**它是指在"发生地"违法的任何行为，或者如果在美国发生会被视为违法的行为，且涉及劫机、破坏、暗杀、对国家元首的暴力攻击, 以及其他一些行为。

*从技术上讲，如果有人说：“我认为俄罗斯应该杀掉普京，这样战争就会结束，俄罗斯人和乌克兰人都会过得更好，”那就属于支持或提倡恐怖活动*——因为恐怖活动包括"违法的行为"。杀普京在俄罗斯是违法的——我几乎可以肯定这一点。我不是俄罗斯法律的专家，但我敢打赌——这也构成暗杀以及对"受国际保护的人"的暴力袭击。

所以这可能是对外籍人士言论的广泛限制。

从法律条文的角度来看，我不能对任何具体案件发表评论，因为我需要确切知道当事人说了什么，尽管这可能会在驱逐程序中进行披露。但**至少原则上，许多支持哈马斯, 或为哈马斯在以色列的行为辩护——为哈马斯谋杀以色列人辩护的人——将会根据这项法律, 被排除或驱逐。**


==== 宪法不确定性
*所以这是法律条文。特朗普总统的行为符合法律条文。但他和这项法律是否"符合宪法"？我认为唯一诚实的答案是：我们不知道。*

你可能会想，“为什么我们不知道？”毕竟，现代自由言论法大约有一个世纪的历史了。这些问题在不同时期出现过。*你会以为先例中会有明确的答案。但事实证明，并没有。*

**有几件事是明确的。第一，当涉及"刑事处罚"和"传统的民事责任"时，居住在美国的外国人, 享有与"美国公民"相同的言论和出版自由。**这是1945年的一个判决，在现代自由言论法的早期。

这实际上涉及一个有趣的案件，劳工领袖哈里·布里奇斯（Harry Bridges）在州法律下被起诉。结果他是澳大利亚公民。**问题是，“政府是否有额外的权力因为他是外国公民, 而起诉他的言论？”最高法院说，“不。”**当涉及普通法律——"普通刑法"和"民事责任"时，外国人在美国享有与"美国公民"相同的权利。

顺便说一下，如果我们谈论的是"外国人在外国发表言论"，或者"外国组织在外国发表言论"，第一修正案不适用。例如，政府可以基于观点, 拒绝资助在外国发表言论的外国组织。最高法院表示，这基本上超出了第一修正案的范围。

那么，入境呢？如果只是作为游客进入美国呢？在1972年的"克莱因迪恩斯特 诉曼德尔案"（Kleindienst v. Mandel）中，一位马克思主义学者被邀请在斯坦福大学演讲——奇怪的是，斯坦福大学是我的雇主，"胡佛研究所"是斯坦福大学的一部分——所以他被邀请了。政府说，“不行。”他们说, 他被拒绝, 是因为他过去违反了签证条件，但最高法院基本上表示，政府可以基于言论排除外国人。

*所以政府可以说，“你看，如果美国人在美国说这些话，他们可以自由地说(有言论自由)。但仅仅是因为我们不得不容忍我们自己的这些人*——我们认为他们的观点非常糟糕，比如纳粹、共产主义者或其他什么人——*但这并不意味着我们必须引入外国人来这样说。*”

现在，我能问你一个问题吗？"克莱因迪恩斯特案"出现时——长期听众可能记得我在我们讨论TikTok时, 对这个案件感兴趣，因为这是一个例子，如果我们认为算法起源于中国——就像比利时马克思主义者一样——但法院在附带意见中解释说，他们感到允许拒绝签证的一个原因是，听众仍然可以通过电话会议等方式, 听到他的讲话。

我认为曼德尔案并不完全明确，或者至少在某些方面存在模糊性，特别是当涉及其他人可能希望听到信息的利益时。但我认为领土性在这里真的很重要，对吧？

是的。所以我认为"克莱因迪恩斯特诉曼德尔案", 在排除权力方面非常明确，这是主权的基本属性——比如，在我们的边境，我们可以对任何人说，“不，我们就是不想要你在这里。”但一旦他们进入——他们是否进入了？我们会讨论这个问题。

但我认为你提出了**一个非常重要的问题：听众的利益怎么办？即使你说，“嗯，外国人——他们不是美国人，不受《权利法案》保护”**——最高法院已经表示他们在某些方面受到保护，至少在许多方面——但假设我们说，“他们不应该受到保护。”*那么，有些美国人可能希望听到他们的观点，而"第一修正案"既保护发言者的权利，也保护听众的权利。*

但在克莱因迪恩斯特案中，**最高法院基本上说，“是的，它确实保护听众的权利。**这就是为什么我们非常认真地对待第一修正案的论点。*但它并没有赋予任何人进入美国的权利。*”所以听众的权利很重要，它们在某些案件中会起到作用，但**在移民问题上，它们只能带你走这么远。**

这在一定程度上与另一个案件类似，因为最高法院还表示，那些想去古巴听讲和观察的人, 没有权利去古巴。我认为那个案件和曼德尔案表明，跨越边境的行为, 被视为一种行为，或者无论如何，某种非表达性的决定，第一修正案不会适用，对吧？


==== 驱逐入境后的问题
接下来我们探讨**这样一个问题：如果我们允许他们进入美国，但后来后悔了，想要将他们赶出去，我们可以这样做吗？我们能否在宪法上这样做？"联邦移民法"可能会在法定层面, 限制政府的这种行为，并且可能会对"程序"提出某些要求，**但在实质上，国会是否可以像它所做的那样说：“你知道，持有这些特定观点的人, 确实可以被驱逐”？

**这里的规则并不明确。**事实上，这个问题曾在1952年的Harisiades v. Shaughnessy案中, 出现在法院面前，法院在案件中讨论了几乎无限的国会驱逐权。然而，这出现在处理"驱逐是否违反正当程序"的部分。

**当涉及到"第一修正案"的争议时，**最高法院表示，“驱逐他是可以的，因为他是共产党员的活跃成员。”而当时——基本上我在这里简化一下——这在许多方面, 被视为可以惩罚的行为，至少对于公民来说是如此。我认为，*法律自那时以来已经有了相当大的变化。*

因此，Harisiades**可以有两种解读。一种是：政府在决定驱逐谁时拥有无限的权力——至少，第一修正案并不限制政府决定驱逐谁，就像它不限制政府决定让谁入境一样。**

另一种解读是：“不，Harisiades案基本上适用了当时的第一修正案规则. 并且说，‘他的言论是不受保护的，所以他可以被驱逐。’”因此，结果并不明确。

*我们知道它不是明确的, 其中一个方法, 就是通过下级法院来看——如联邦上诉法院，虽然这些法院的地位相对较高，但仍低于最高法院——它们对此问题的看法相当混乱。*

例如，1995年第九巡回法院的一个案件——美国阿拉伯反歧视委员会诉雷诺案（American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee v. Reno）——*被最高法院推翻，但基于其他理由，所以最高法院最终没有对这个问题作出裁决*——该案件说，“正确解读的话，哈里西亚德斯案确立了, "驱逐理由"应适用与其他第一修正案权利负担相同的标准。”这是引用。所以基本上说，对外国人的规则与对公民的规则相同。

1985年，第四巡回法院也做出了类似的裁决。

**另一方面，**1991年，第九**巡回法院的一个案件认为，由于法院历来在移民和归化领域, 给予"国会"极大的尊重，因此"第一修正案"对居民外籍人士的保护, 可能是有限的。**

这里有一个特别相关的引用，因为它涉及一位合法永久居民的原告：“尽管普莱斯有理由期待非公民所能获得的最大程度的宪法保护”——再次强调，因为**他是合法"永久居民"，绿卡持有者，**绝对不是非法外国人，也不是暂时访问的学生或其他类似身份——“**所以**尽管他拥有最大程度的宪法保护，**他所获得的保护, 肯定不超过**克莱因迪恩斯特案中的**"美国公民"原告**”——记得我们刚刚讨论的那个案件的结果吗? ——“他们的诉求被驳回了。”

基本上是在说：“看，想要听Mandel演讲的那些人是美国公民。他们在Kleindienst案中输了，Price也会在这里失败。”

==== 公民身份与选择性起诉
顺便说一句，这又引发了一个问题，那就是：既不驱逐出境，也不给予初始入境许可——那公民身份呢？*政府是否可以说：*“看，你知道，*也许我们不会驱逐你，但我们不希望你在我们的选举中投票。我们不希望你在国家治理中扮演角色*”？

在这方面，Price案件表明，**国会可以基于你的某些言论, 而拒绝给予非公民(的你)公民身份，而这些言论如果是出自美国公民之口, 则后者会受到保护。**引述如下：“入籍决定, 至少应当获得与"初始入境决定"同等程度的司法尊重”——这又回到了克莱因迪恩斯特的观点。

所以**答案并不明确。**

但有一件事情的答案至少比较清楚，它可能解决一些案件，尽管不能解决所有案件。在Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee案件中——记得这是我提到的那个第九巡回法院案件，后来上诉至最高法院, 并以其他理由解决——最高法院认为，基本上，通常来说——也许有一些例外，但**一般来说——被驱逐的非公民, 不能提出"选择性起诉"的主张。**

如果我因某些罪行被起诉，我可以说：“看，你们起诉我的真正原因是因为我的言论，我希望撤销对我的指控，因为如果不是因为我的政治立场, 或我所说的言论，这些指控根本不会被提出。这是受宪法保护的言论。你们表面上说我是因逃税被起诉的，或者别的什么，但实际上你们是因为我的言论而针对我。”

*这些案件对被告来说很难胜诉，但原则上，他们可以胜诉。然而，一般来说，当涉及移民决定时，最高法院明确表示，你不能提出选"择性起诉"的主张。*

也许有一个例外，即政府基本上"承认选择性起诉"——嗯，这正是我要问的——因为在这些Truth Social的帖子中，对吧，表明我们知道这里的推理是什么，对吧？

是的。所以，至少在许多情况下，当某人说，“嗯，我认为你追查我的真正原因是因为我参加了这些示威活动。你说是因为我参与了非法侵入或其他类似行为，但真正的原因是你不喜欢示威活动的信息”——嗯，最高法院的决定明确表示，这种论点不会成立。

但回到更广泛的问题：如果政府说：“不，不，我们要强调，我们追究你——事实上，我们追究你的唯一原因——假设政府这么说——就是你支持或宣扬外国恐怖活动”？关于这一点，第一修正案的规则是什么——我们只是不知道，至少不确定。

==== 关于Khalil案件的适用性
非常有趣。需要明确的是，我们并不知道Khalil是否明确表示, 或做了任何支持哈马斯袭击的行为。至少我所看到的引用是，他曾表示，学生抗议者应该在哥伦比亚大学撤资(以色列企业)之前, 不要离开校园，我认为这并不完全符合支持或宣扬恐怖活动的广泛定义。

但正如你所说，我们会进一步了解他所说或做的事情，对吧？

顺便说一下，我应该提到——虽然在我一开始读到法律条文时可能忽略了这一部分，因为它有点技术性，但在这里可能是相关的——*该法条还规定了那些威胁、试图或共谋支持或宣扬恐怖活动的人, 也可以被排除或驱逐。*

*所以，如果我参与了一个与他人共同的阴谋，其中他们是支持或宣扬恐怖活动的人，而我故意通过各种方式帮助他们，以推动他们支持或宣扬恐怖活动的目标，那么这可能构成"共谋"，并且本身会导致被驱逐或排除*——再次强调，如果我是外籍人士的话，幸运的是我早已离开了这种身份。

==== 个人轶事
顺便说一下，我应该告诉大家，以说明我是多么一个外来且可疑的角色——你知道，我时不时地需要为律师资格申请提供一些信息——这取决于不同的司法管辖区——但我可能需要列出我曾经使用过的所有名字。除了“Eugene Volokh”之外，我还得说“Yevgeny Volokh”，因为在申请美国签证时，我清楚地记得，我的俄语名字是Yevgeny——这是Eugene的俄语版本——但是它是音译而非翻译过来的。

然后，幸运的是，我的父母意识到，在美国生活，如果用“Eugene”这个名字会更容易些，因为至少每个人都大致知道怎么拼写和发音。无论如何——这也是为什么我的Yakowitz家族曾经很长时间使用“Yorks”这个名字。

所以，是的，如果我的父母当时也做了同样的事，把我的姓氏也改掉——不过话说回来，你知道，做一些与众不同的事情也有好处。这也成了某种商标。

无论如何，作为公民，我们拥有这些权利。作为外籍人士，我曾经享有其中的一些权利——很多言论自由的权利——但可能没有最重要的那个权利，那就是不因我说的话而被驱逐，或许吧。

但其中最重要的权利之一——好吧，我认为在你的案例中，它可能是最重要的，鉴于你的职业生涯走向，对吧？

嗯，考虑到我可能会被驱逐到哪里——确实也是，没错。

==== 后续问题
好的，我有两个后续问题。一个是，我看到在围绕这一争议的报道中，至少有一篇评论说，在驱逐程序完成之前，或者至少在程序开始之前，不清楚Khalil是否能通过美国公民自由联盟提出第一修正案的挑战。对吗？我的意思是，我认为这是一个关于“立场”的问题。鉴于已经有了逮捕，这看起来难以置信，对吧？

在我看来这有点奇怪，不过我得说，移民法是一个极其复杂的专业领域。我确信自己了解第一修正案的相关规定——尽管这些规定可能并不完善。正如我们所见，我所知道的仅仅是我们在移民法方面知之甚少。此外，我读过的那部法规——我对其还算熟悉——但关于您所提到的具体程序以及何时提出这些程序，还有关于这些主张应在何处提出（即在哪个具体的联邦地区提出）的详细规定，存在着一些有趣的问题——但我并不清楚答案。

好吧，那么第二个问题是政策问题。你觉得这是个好主意吗？即使你知道，考虑到过去的一些事件，我认为我们双方都公开表明过，我个人是有点怀疑某些学生抗议运动的明智性，对吧？那么，对于政府而言，是否应该基于抗议活动选择性地撤销某些人进入美国的资格？无论我们讨论的是持签证者还是绿卡持有者，这样做是一个好主意吗？

==== 政策讨论
不，我不这么认为。我非常相信"言论自由"是寻求真理、思想市场, 和"民主自治"的重要——甚至是必要的——条件。当然，外国人本身并不是民主自治的直接参与者，但他们确实与美国公民交谈，美国公民可能会从他们那里学到重要的东西。

有时，他们可能会被他们说服。有时，他们可能会学到：“哇，这些人真的是持有这些我认为可怕的观点，但这让我对校园发生的事情、世界上发生的事情, 以及美国各个政治角落发生的事情, 有了新的视角。”这些信息是有用的。

因此，出于所有这些原因，能够听到"非美国公民"的意见, 是相当重要的——尤其是因为世界上大约96%的人口都不是美国人。外面的世界非常大，能够听到外国人——那些可能最近才刚刚生活在外国，可能即将返回外国，或者在合法"永久居民"的情况下可能并非如此——他们是如何看待世界的，是非常有用的。这可能有助于影响我们对美国人的判断，影响我们对我们国家应该做什么的判断。

所以我相信所有这些，反过来说，我认为大学也应该让人们自由地讨论这些问题。当你看到你的朋友和同学因为说“我不想被驱逐”而感到言论受到压制时，这种压制效应会影响到每个人。

我的意思是，你可能会说：“嗯，我不必担心会被驱逐出境。”但即便如此，你还是——这种情况变得越来越少见了——不再是一个真正能让人们自由表达自我、自由谈论各种话题的群体了——比如说，甚至公开支持恐怖主义活动这类话题都不行。

我想有些人，在他们人生的不同阶段——尤其是在年轻的时候——对政治暴力是相当开放的，尤其是在国外。要知道，这里说的是——我们说的是支持外国恐怖主义活动以及在国外制造暴力——可能有过这样的想法：“没错，绝对没错，更多的革命、更多的战争、更多的诸如此类的东西”，然后最终他们意识到这是个错误。对我来说，和人们讨论这个问题很有帮助，能让我认识到这是个错误。

所以，基于上述种种原因，我总体上认为，对于"非公民"而言，不应该存在此类限制，就如同不应该对"公民"施加此类限制一样。

现在，你或许会试图区分这样一些情况：有人所说的话暗示他们实际上会对"身处美国的美国人"构成威胁。所以你可以想象政府介入并表示：“瞧，这个人说的话, 让我们觉得他可能会试图轰炸犹太教堂、清真寺, 或者政府大楼等等。我们只是想把他赶走，这样他就不再对我们构成威胁了。”你可以想象在这种情况下, 可能会有另一种不同的论调——尽管即便如此，对于这种"驱逐出境"的做法，我还是会相当怀疑的。

但看起来很明显的是，该法案（要知道，该法案的重点在于对恐怖主义活动的支持，而绝大多数此类活动发生在海外）似乎表明，我认为该法案以及政府目前的做法, 都没有着眼于一个狭隘的理由。他们关注的是更广泛的理由：“再说一次，*仅仅因为我们得允许美国人说出这些可怕的话，并不意味着我们就得接纳那些会说出这些话的外国人。*”

但我认为，从根本上说，这会适得其反。我认为这不利于美国的公共辩论，也不利于美国大学里严肃且富有思考力的讨论。因为要知道，这不仅适用于在营地里高喊口号的人——包括那些常常是非法的营地——也适用于——根据相关法规，有人可能会因为就外国政治暴力的希望问题进行严肃且富有思考力的讨论, 而被驱逐出境。

是啊，写一篇措辞礼貌的社论发表在学生报上——这才是关键所在。

嗯，我的意思是，所以这些观点我都认同。我还想强调的是，除了你我双方都坚定信奉的言论自由理论之外，还有另外一点，那就是它（言论自由理论）实际上起到了反作用——我想你用的是这个词。

要知道，实际上大多数人对这些学生抗议活动以及他们提出的要求都颇为不满。而现在，你看，哈利勒的态度变得相当令人同情了，尤其是因为他马上就要有了孩子。而且还有一群律师纷纷前来，试图区分支持恐怖主义与反对以色列政府决策之间的区别，这纯粹是政策层面的问题，或者说是，你懂的，区分支持恐怖主义与反对以色列政府决策之间的区别。所以，我觉得，即便你完全出于某种动机，愿意动用你所拥有的任何政府权力来达成你想要的结果——我们俩都不是这样的人——即便如此，即便你这么做，这也会是一个非常糟糕的决定，哪怕只是为了实现唐纳德·特朗普似乎想要的那些短期目标。

所以，没错，我倾向于认为这是事实——尤其是考虑到特朗普政府自诩是在保护言论自由，却指责欧洲人为过度限制言论而指责他们。我的意思是，我认为特朗普政府里的一些人可能会说：“没错，我们说的是美国人的言论。我们主张美国优先，而且没错，我们不太在意外国人的言论——尤其是那些作为访客来到我们国家然后违反我们规定的人的言论。”所以，你知道，也许他们可以通过这种方式在政治上为自己辩护。

我在对美国政治中哪些议题会受欢迎、哪些不会受欢迎的预测方面表现得实在太糟糕了，以至于我都不敢很自信地发表意见。不过我倾向于认同你的观点，即这种做法会让那些表达这种观点的人——其中很多人其实应该为这些观点受到谴责——即便不是成为言论自由的殉道者，至少也会让他们处于一种更正面的境地。

但话说回来，我还是无法断言这件事在皮奥里亚会如何发展，也无法断言它在葡萄牙又会如何演变。

3.14. 结论
很好。好吧，嗯，我想我们得先看看这事儿在纽约市的法庭上会如何发展吧。

嗯，这是个不错的提问。所以，为了让大家明白——关于联邦法院的管辖权问题，可能是在某个地方，比如纽约州法院。但据我所知，其中一个问题是，它究竟是在纽约州的联邦法院提起诉讼，还是——我曾听到有人提到在路易斯安那州提起诉讼。

路易斯安那州，没错。没错。

这件事上，我（认为）是这样的。

我可以相当有信心地说，如果我们期望这个案件为我们提供先例，我们可能得等很长时间。我们的司法系统通常不会特别快，但移民系统特别复杂，有很多层次的审查。也许某个时刻，最高法院会解决其中的一些问题，但这可能需要一段时间。

那么，Jane，非常感谢，就像往常一样，非常愉快的对话，我们期待几周后再和你们大家谈话。

谢谢。

==== Introduction and Hosts
Welcome to Free Speech Unmuted. I'm Eugene Volokh, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford and Emeritus Law Professor at UCLA Law School. My co-host, Jane Bambauer, is a professor—many decades away from being an Emeritus—at the University of Florida, in the Law School and the Journalism Department.

==== New Feature Announcement
Before we get to the substance of our show, I wanted to announce a new feature. It’s a mailbag feature. If you have questions about free speech, you can go to hoover.org/askunmuted—that’s hoover.org/askunmuted, one word, ‘askunmuted’—and leave us your question. Then we’ll probably periodically do an ‘answering user questions’ show. So that’s a new feature. Hope you enjoy it.

==== Topic Introduction: Free Speech and Non-U.S. Citizens
Today we will turn to the question about free speech and aliens—free speech and people who are not U.S. citizens—and to what extent they are protected by the First Amendment.

Yes, we decided to record on this topic today because, in the news cycle right now, is a controversy involving a former Columbia graduate student named Mahmoud Khalil—and a few days ago he was arrested by ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

==== Case Background: Mahmoud Khalil
The announcement from DHS on X—maybe I’ll just read part of it—explained that he was arrested because, and here I’m quoting, "Khalil led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization." So I think that wording might be important: "was later aligned to Hamas."

The background is that Khalil was frequently in the reporting on—his name was mentioned in a lot of the reporting about the protests going on at Columbia University. He served as the—the student groups that were setting up encampments and making demands about divestment from Israeli companies and whatnot used Khalil as their main negotiator.

There was a CNN story around that time where Khalil not only talked about his experience as the negotiator and what they want and why they had turned down some offers that other universities had previously used successfully, but he also said that they would not decamp, even after Columbia University gave them an order to.

He had mentioned back last year, in 2024, that he was a little bit nervous being on the forefront of the protest movement because, at the time, he was in the country on a student visa.

Now it’s a little confusing. During the time of the arrest, the Trump administration had suggested that he still—at least in some of their tweets and whatnot—had suggested that he still was a visa holder. But it’s now clear, at least according to Khalil’s lawyers at ACLU, that he has become a green card holder. So he graduated, I think, in December of 2024. He’s a permanent resident now. He’s married. He’s expecting a child soon. So that’s his residency status.

==== Legal Questions Introduced
We need to understand whether, as a statutory matter and then also as a constitutional matter, the Trump administration really can deport someone like Khalil, who has been working quite actively with protest groups that, in addition to engaging in speech, also engaged in at least some—at least trespass and maybe some other illegal acts as well.

So, does that set us up well enough, or do you want to add anything?

Well, it sets us up almost too well. So here are these interesting factual disputes about this particular case—or factual accounts with some factual uncertainties. We don’t know for sure, for example, as I understand it, whether the federal government is also saying that he was indeed conspiring to commit crimes, and if so, what kind of crimes—yes, they committed trespass, perhaps, or something like that, but maybe even more.

The facts of the case, I think, help illuminate what’s going on. But there’s a broader question that arises for many more people and in various different kinds of ways. So let’s turn briefly to this broader question.

==== Statutory Framework
Let’s start with the statutes. First of all, the government is, generally speaking, entitled to deport people—at least constitutionally entitled to deport people—if they commit crimes.

A citizen, by the way—I used to be an alien. I was born in the then-Soviet Union. I am, thankfully, a United States citizen. But back before then, if I had been at the tender age of—I think it was 14 when I got citizenship—the tender age of, say, 13, if I had committed a crime—and let’s actually, to make it easier, assume that I was an adult when I committed the crime—it’s possible I might have been deported for that. Certainly, I had no constitutional right to remain in the U.S. so long as I was not a U.S. citizen.

Now that I am a citizen, if I commit a crime—not that I would—but if I were, I could be punished, but I couldn’t be deported. But non-citizens can be, at least consistent with the Constitution, deported for committing crimes.

Of course, there are also statutory limits. Not every single crime—not every time you speed or something like that—would you be deported. And, of course, there are also various procedures that are required—procedures, perhaps, of the sort that are being gone through right now, having to do with whether, in fact, you’re legally eligible for—whether the government is legally allowed to deport you under the statute.

So there’s this complicated statutory scheme of immigration law, but as a constitutional matter, people can be deported for committing crimes.

Now, what if somebody is deported solely because of their speech? So let’s start with the statutory provisions.


This is one area where President Trump is not really getting way ahead of Congress the way he is in some areas where there’s a question as to whether he’s entitled to. Here, there is a federal statute—there’s been, for quite a while, a federal statute—which specifically provides that an alien may be excluded or deported for endorsing or espousing terrorist activity or persuading others to endorse or espouse terrorist activity or support a terrorist organization.

This is based on speech. It’s not just if you are a terrorist—of course, if you’re a terrorist, you could be excluded and deported. Of course, if you’re actually conspiring with a foreign terrorist organization, you could be excluded or deported based on that crime. And likely, maybe incitement too, if you actually, within the bounds of incitement—but here, just endorsing is not any of those things.

This is speech that would be constitutionally protected, generally speaking, for American citizens. But the immigration laws say that if you engage in such speech, you are excludable—both at the border, you can be not allowed in in the first place, and you can be deported if you engage in such speech.

Am I correct that this statute—the language from this statute that we’re focusing on—came out of the Patriot Act, which, I think, is also an interesting question?

That’s my vague recollection. I have not actually looked into it.

If you look at how terrorist activity is defined, again—and it’s enough for this law that you endorse or espouse it—but if you look at how it’s defined, it’s defined very broadly. It’s any activity which is unlawful under the laws of the place where it is committed, or which would have been unlawful in the U.S. if it had been committed in the U.S., and which involves hijacking, sabotage, assassination, violent attacks on chiefs of state, and a few other things.

Technically, if somebody were to say, "I think that someone in Russia should shoot Putin, and that’s the way that the war will be over, and things will get better for Russians as well as the Ukrainians," that would be endorsing or espousing terrorist activity—because terrorist activity includes activity that’s unlawful. Shooting Putin is unlawful in Russia—I’m quite sure of that. I’m not an expert in Russian law, but I’m willing to bet on that—and it’s an assassination as well as a violent attack on an internationally protected person.

So this is potentially a broad restriction on the speech of aliens.

As a statutory matter, I can’t speak to any particular case because I need to know exactly what the person said, although presumably that will come out in these proceedings that need to happen before someone is deported. But at least in principle, many people who spoke out, say, in favor of Hamas or defending Hamas’s actions in Israel—of Hamas’s murder of Israelis—they would be, in fact, excludable, deportable under the statute.

==== Constitutional Uncertainty
So that’s the statute. President Trump is acting consistently with the statute. Are he and the statute consistent with the Constitution? And the answer is, I think the only honest answer is: we don’t know.

You might think, "Why don’t we know?" I mean, after all, modern free speech law is about a century old, more or less. These issues have arisen at various times. You’d think there would be a clear answer in the precedents. Turns out, there’s not.

A few things are clear. The first thing is that, when it comes to criminal punishment and traditional civil liability, freedom of speech and of the press is afforded aliens residing in this country. That’s a 1945 decision that was quite early, again, in modern free speech law.

That actually involved an interesting case involving a labor leader, Harry Bridges, who was being prosecuted under state law. It turns out he was an Australian citizen. The question was, "Can he be prosecuted—can the government have extra authority to prosecute him for speech because he’s a foreign citizen?" The Supreme Court said, "No." When it comes to normal law—normal criminal law and normal civil liability—aliens have the same rights as citizens when they’re in the U.S.

By the way, if we’re talking about aliens speaking in foreign countries or foreign organizations speaking in foreign countries, the First Amendment doesn’t apply. The government, for example, can deny funding in viewpoint-based ways to foreign organizations speaking in foreign countries. That’s just outside the reach, essentially, of the First Amendment, the Supreme Court has said.

Now, what about entry? What about just coming into the United States in the first place, say, as a tourist? Well, in a case called Kleindienst v. Mandel—a 1972 case involving a Marxist academic who was invited to speak, oddly enough, at Stanford University, which is my employer—Hoover is, of course, a unit of Stanford University—so he was invited. The government said, "No." Now, they had said that he was rejected because he’d violated visa conditions in the past, but the Supreme Court basically said that the government can exclude aliens even based on their speech.

So it can just say, "Look, you know, if you were an American saying these things in America, you’d be free to do that. But just because we have to tolerate our own people like that—our own people with views that we think are very bad, Nazis, Communists, or whatever else—doesn’t mean we have to import them."

Now, can I ask you a question about that one? So Kleindienst came up—longtime listeners might recall I was interested in this case when we were thinking about TikTok because that’s an example of where, if we think of the algorithm as originating in China—and just like a Belgian Marxist—but in dicta, the Court explained that one reason they felt comfortable allowing the visa to be denied was that the listeners who have the interests—who have First Amendment interests—were still getting his message because there was, at the time, a telephone conference where he could deliver his remarks anyways, or something like that.

I take it that Mandel is not completely clear, or it leaves at least some vagueness about, especially when it comes to the interests of others who might want to hear a message. But I think the territoriality here really matters, right?

Right. So I think Kleindienst v. Mandel is pretty clear in the power to exclude, which is sort of an essential attribute of sovereignty—like, we, at our borders, we can say to anybody, "No, we just don’t want you here." But once they’re in—are they in? We’ll get to that.

But I do think you raise a very important question: what about listener interests, right? Even if you were to say, "Well, you know, aliens—they’re not Americans, they’re not protected by the Bill of Rights"—again, the Supreme Court has said they are protected, at least as to some things, as to many things—but let’s say we say, "You know, they shouldn’t be protected." Well, there are Americans who may want to hear their views, and the First Amendment protects the rights of listeners as well as of speakers.

But in Kleindienst, the Supreme Court essentially said, "Yes, yes, it does protect the rights of listeners. That’s why we’re taking this argument—the First Amendment argument—quite seriously. But it doesn’t give anyone the right to come into the U.S." So the rights of listeners are important. They make a difference in various kinds of cases, but they will only take you so far when it comes to immigration.

And there is sort of a parallel there because the Supreme Court has also said that people who want to go listen and observe in Cuba don’t have a right to travel to Cuba. I think that case and Mandel sort of show that the crossing borders is just treated as a—whether we call it conduct or, in any case, some non-expressive decision that does not, where the First Amendment won’t attach, right?

==== Deportation After Entry
So then we get to this question of: what happens if we do let them in, but then we regret it and we want to kick them out? Can we do that again? Can we do that as a constitutional matter? Federal immigration law may limit the government’s power to do that as a statutory matter and may certainly impose certain procedures, but can—substantively—Congress say, as it has, "You know, people who espouse these particular views can indeed be deported"?

Well, here the rule is unclear. Now, this issue did come before the Court in a case called Harisiades v. Shaughnessy back in 1952, and there the Court did speak about basically nearly unlimited congressional power over deportation. But that came in the section dealing with the argument that deportation violated due process.

When it came to the First Amendment argument, the Supreme Court said, "Well, it’s okay to deport him because he’s an active member in the Communist Party." And at the time—basically, I oversimplify here—but at the time, that was seen as punishable, at least in many respects, even for citizens. I think the law has changed in considerable measure since then.

But Harisiades, therefore, can be read two ways. One is: the government has unlimited authority in deciding whom to kick out—at least, as a matter—the First Amendment does not constrain the government in deciding whom to kick out, just as it doesn’t constrain the government in deciding whom to let in.

But another possibility is to say, "No, Harisiades basically applied the then-existing First Amendment rule and said, 'Well, his speech is unprotected, so that’s why he can be kicked out.'" So as a result, things are unclear.

One way of knowing that they’re unclear is that lower courts—like the federal appellate courts, so pretty high, but lower than the Supreme Court—are quite mixed on this.



For example, there was a Ninth Circuit case from 1995—American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee v. Reno—which was reversed by the Supreme Court, but on other grounds, so the Supreme Court did not end up passing judgment on this question—that said, "Look, read properly, Harisiades establishes the deportation grounds are to be judged by the same standard applied to other burdens on First Amendment rights." That’s a quote. So basically saying rules are the same for aliens as they are for citizens.

There’s a Fourth Circuit case from 1985 that ruled the same way.

On the other hand, there is a Ninth Circuit case from 1991 which said that the protection afforded resident aliens by the First Amendment may be limited because the Court has historically afforded Congress great deference in the area of immigration and naturalization.

Here’s a particularly relevant quote because it involved the plaintiff who’s a lawful permanent resident: "Although Price is justified in expecting the greatest degree of constitutional protection afforded a non-citizen"—again, because he was a lawful permanent resident, green card holder, certainly not an illegal alien, but also not a temporarily visiting student or something like that—"so although he has the greatest degree of constitutional protection, the protection afforded him certainly is not greater than that of the citizen plaintiffs in Kleindienst"—remember the case we just talked about—"whose claims were rejected."

So essentially it was saying, "Look, the people who wanted to listen to Mandel were American citizens. They lost in Kleindienst. Price will lose here too."

==== Citizenship and Selective Prosecution
And by the way, this raises another question, which is: neither deportation nor initial admission—what about citizenship? Can the government say, "Look, you know, maybe we won’t deport you, but we don’t want you to be voting in our elections. We don’t want you to be playing a role in the governance of our nation"?

And there, Price suggests that Congress can deny non-citizens citizenship based on speech that would be protected if said by a citizen. Quote: "Naturalization decisions deserve at least as much judicial deference as do decisions about initial admission"—back again to Kleindienst.

So the answer is unclear.

But there’s one last thing where the answer is at least clearer, and it may resolve some of these cases, although not all of them. In Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee—remember, that’s that Ninth Circuit case I said went up to the Supreme Court, was resolved on other grounds—the Supreme Court did hold that, basically, generally speaking—maybe with a few exceptions, but generally speaking—one thing that non-citizens who are being deported can’t do is raise a selective prosecution claim.

If I’m being prosecuted for some crime, I can say, "Look, the real reason you’re prosecuting me is my speech, and I want the charges dismissed against me because they would not have been filed if it weren’t for my political affiliation or things that I’ve said. It’s constitutionally protected speech. You’re saying you’re prosecuting me for tax evasion or whatever else, but really you’re targeting me because of my speech."

Those are hard cases for defendants to win, but in principle, they can win them. Whereas, generally speaking, when it comes to immigration decisions, the Supreme Court clearly said you can’t raise the selective prosecution.

Maybe there’s an exception where the government basically admits to selective prosecution—well, that’s what I was just going to ask—because in these Truth Social posts, right, suggest that we know what the reasoning is here, okay?

Right. So, but at least in many situations where the person says, "Well, I think the real reason you’re going after me is because I participated in these demonstrations. You’re saying it’s because I was involved in trespass or some such, but really the reason is you didn’t like the message of the demonstration"—well, the Supreme Court’s decision makes clear that that argument isn’t going to fly.

But returning to the broader point: what if the government says, "No, no, no, we want to stress that the reason we are going after you—in fact, the only thing we’re going after you—let’s assume the government says—is you’re endorsing or espousing foreign terrorist activity"? What the First Amendment rule about that is—we just don’t know, at least don’t know for sure.

==== Application to Khalil’s Case
Very interesting. And just to be clear, we do not know that Khalil specifically said or did anything that actually endorses the Hamas attacks. Just to be—at least the quotes that I’ve seen are ones where he has said that the student protesters should not leave campus until Columbia divests, and I think that’s not—that doesn’t quite fit the even the broad definition of endorsing or espousing terrorist activity.

But, like you said, we will learn more about what he has said and done, right?

By the way, I should mention—though a part I may have omitted when I read the statute at the outset because it’s a little technical, but might be relevant here—the statute also makes excludable and deportable people who threaten, attempt, or conspire to endorse or espouse terrorist activity.

So if I’m involved in a conspiracy with other people where they’re the ones who are endorsing or espousing terrorist activity, but I am deliberately helping them in various ways with the aim of promoting their endorsement or espousal of terrorist activity, that would presumably be conspiracy to do that and would itself be deportable or excludable—again, if I were an alien, a status that I have, thankfully, left far in the past.

==== Personal Anecdote
By the way, I should tell people, just to acknowledge what a foreign and suspect character I am—you know, every so often I have to, for bar admission, indicate—depends on the jurisdiction—but I may have to indicate all the names I have ever been known under. And in addition to Eugene Volokh, I have to say "Yevgeny Volokh" because, on the visa to get into the U.S., I distinctly remember, my Russian name is Yevgeny—which is the Russian version of Eugene—but it was just transliterated rather than translated.

Then, thankfully, my parents realized that life in America would be easier as "Eugene" if you come up with a name that at least everybody knows roughly how to spell and how to pronounce, more or less. But in any case—this is why my Yakowitz family went by "Yorks" for a long time.

So yes, if only my parents had done the same with my last name—although then again, you know, there are advantages to being odd. It sort of becomes a bit of a trademark.

In any event, so as citizens, we have all of these rights. As an alien, I had some of those rights—many of the free speech rights—but maybe not the most important one of all, which is the right not to be deported for the things that I say, maybe.

But one of the most important rights of all—well, I think in your case, it probably is the most important, given where your career wound up, right?

Well, and given where I would have been deported to—that too, yes.

==== Follow-Up Questions
Okay, so I have two follow-up questions. One is that I saw, in some of the reporting around this controversy, I saw at least one commentary say that it’s not clear whether Khalil, through the ACLU, will be able to raise a First Amendment challenge before removal proceedings have finished, or at least been initiated. Is that correct? I mean, I think this was a matter of standing. That seems to me hard to believe, given that there’s been an arrest, but—right?

It seems odd to me, but I should say, immigration law is a highly, highly technical field. I’m comfortable that I know the First Amendment rules—such as they are. As we see, all I may know is we know very little, having to do with immigration law. Also, the statute that I read—I’m familiar with—but the exact procedures about what you raise and when, and there are interesting questions about where physically, in what district—in what federal district—these claims have to be made—all of these are important questions to which I do not know the answer.

Okay, so then the second question is the policy question. So, do you think this is a good idea? Even if, you know, I think, given past episodes, I think we’re both on the record as being, I think, somewhat skeptical of the wisdom of some of these student protest movements, right? Is it a good idea to—whether we’re talking about visa holders or green card holders—is it a good idea for the government to selectively revoke access to American soil based on protest activity?

==== Policy Discussion
No, I do not. I’m a big believer in free speech as an important—in fact, necessary—condition of the search for truth, of the marketplace of ideas, of democratic self-government. Now, of course, aliens, by definition, are not themselves direct participants in democratic self-government, but they do talk to American citizens, and American citizens may learn important things from them.

Sometimes they may be persuaded by them. Sometimes one of the things they may learn is, "Wow, these people really hold these ideas, which I think are awful ideas, but this gives me a new perspective on what’s happening on campuses, what’s happening in the world, and what’s happening in various political corners of the United States." It’s useful information to know.

So for all of these reasons, being able to hear what non-citizens have to say is quite important—especially because about 96% of the world, more or less, consists of people who are not Americans. It’s a big, big world out there, and it’s useful to be able to hear what foreigners—people who maybe just very recently lived in a foreign country, maybe about to return to a foreign country, or maybe not, in the case of lawful permanent residents—but how they see the world. That may help influence our judgment about Americans, about what makes sense for our country to do.

So I believe in all these things, and the flip side of that is, I think it’s important to the university that people be free to talk about these things. And when you see your friends and your classmates being chilled in their speech because they say, "I don’t want to get deported," it creates a chilling effect on everybody.

I mean, you might say, "Well, I don’t have to worry about getting deported," but still, you’re getting—it becomes less a community of people who really are genuinely free to express themselves and free to talk about all sorts of issues—like, for example, even espousing terrorist activity.

I imagine there are people who have, at various times in their lives—especially when they’re younger—been quite open to political violence, especially overseas. Remember, this is—we’re talking about espousing foreign terrorist activity and violence in foreign countries—may have been, "Yes, absolutely, more revolution, more war, more whatever," and then eventually they realized that was a mistake. And it was useful for me to talk it over with people, to recognize it’s a mistake.

So, for all these reasons, I generally think that there ought not be these kinds of restrictions on non-citizens any more than on citizens.

Now, you might try to distinguish situations where people are saying things that suggest that they’re actually a hazard to Americans in America. So you can imagine the government coming in and saying, "Look, this person is saying things that make us think that he’s going to try to bomb synagogues or bomb mosques or bomb government buildings or whatever else in America. We just want to kick him out just so he’s no longer a danger to us." You can imagine possibly having a different kind of argument as to that—although even there, I would be quite skeptical of that kind of deportation.

But it seems pretty clear that both the statute—which, remember, focuses on endorsement of terrorist activity, the great bulk of which is overseas terrorist activity—that so it seems to me that both the statute and the administration right now aren’t looking at a narrow rationale. They’re looking at the broader rationale: "Again, just because we have to allow Americans to say these awful things doesn’t mean we have to import foreigners who are going to say that."

But I think, ultimately, that’s counterproductive. I think it’s bad for American public debate, and I think it’s bad for serious, thoughtful discussions at American universities. Because, remember, this doesn’t just apply to people chanting slogans in encampments—including often illegal encampments—it also applies to—somebody could be deported under the statute for having a serious, thoughtful conversation about hope of foreign political violence.

Yeah, writing a polite op-ed in the student newspaper—that’s the thing.

Yeah, I mean, so I agree with all of those things. I do also want to highlight that in addition to the free speech theory, which you and I both are firmly committed to, it also is very counterproductive—I think is the word you used.

Because, you know, most people were actually pretty annoyed by these student protests and the demands, and now we have—you know, now Khalil is looking quite sympathetic, especially with a baby on the way. And you have a bunch of lawyers coming in trying to parse the difference between supporting terrorism versus being against Israeli government decisions as a policy matter, or, you know—and so that’s just—I think, even if you were completely instrumental and were willing to use whatever government power you have to achieve the ends you want—which neither of us are—but even if you were, this would be a really bad call, even on even to achieve the short-term ends that Donald Trump seems to want.

So, yeah, I’m inclined to say that that’s so—especially given that the Trump administration is billing itself as protecting free speech and faulting Europeans for unduly restricting speech. I mean, I take it that some people from the administration may say, "Yeah, we mean the speech of Americans. We’re about America First, and yeah, sure, we don’t care as much about the speech of foreigners—especially who come here as visitors to our country and then violate our rules." So, you know, perhaps they could defend themselves this way politically.

I’ve been so poor in my predictions of what’s going to play well and what won’t politically in American politics that I can’t speak with great confidence. But I’m inclined to tend to agree with you that this is putting people who express these views—many of whom really should be condemned for those views—it’s making them, if not quite free speech martyrs, but at least putting them in a more positive light.

But again, I just can’t say I’m completely certain at how this is going to play in Peoria or how it’s going to play in Portugal.

==== Conclusion
Very good. All right, well, we’ll see how it plays out in the courts of New York City, I guess, first.

Well, that’s a good question. So, just to be clear—friendly amendment—of the federal courts, somewhere, maybe in New York. But this is one of the questions, as I understand it, is whether it’s going to be in the federal courts in New York or—I’ve heard talk about in Louisiana.

Louisiana, that’s right. That’s right.

The one thing that I can say with considerable confidence is, if we expect this case to give us the precedent, we could be waiting a long time. Our justice system is generally not super fast, but the immigration system is extra complicated, with a lot of layers of review. Maybe at some point, the Supreme Court is going to resolve some of these questions, but it may take a while.

So, Jane, thank you very much, as always. Such a delightful conversation, and we look forward to talking with the rest of you folks in a few weeks.

Thanks.
