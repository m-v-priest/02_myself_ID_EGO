==== Introduction by Katie Dunn Tempesta
Hi, I'm Katie Dunn Tempesta, a visiting fellow 访问学者 in governance studies 治理研究 at the Brookings Institution 布鲁金斯学会 and the director 主任 of the Katzman Initiative on Improving Interbranch Relations and Government. This is Democracy in Question, a podcast 播客 about contemporary American politics 当代美国政治 and the future of democracy 民主的未来. In each episode 集, I ask my guests a different question about democracy so we can better understand the broader contours 轮廓 of our democratic system 民主制度. There's a lot happening in U.S. politics at the moment, including a highly contested 竞争激烈的 presidential race 总统竞选, but in this podcast, I'm trying to get at the deeper questions of how democracy works—or is supposed to work. On today's episode, the question is: Does my vote really matter?

==== ​Voter Turnout Statistics and Trends
The 2020 presidential election 总统选举 had one of the highest voter turnouts 投票率 as a percentage of the voting-age population 适龄选民, around 66%, but that means a third of Americans didn't vote at all. In most presidential elections over the past century, nearly half of eligible voters 合格选民 sat elections out 不参与选举. Participation in primaries 初选, off-year 非大选年, and local elections 地方选举 tends to have even lower turnout. Historical trends 历史趋势 show that the younger you are, the less likely you are to vote. Voters aged 18 to 29 routinely have the lowest turnout—under 50%—compared to all other age cohorts 年龄群体. Non-voters 不投票者 offer many explanations for not participating in elections, including that elections are rigged 被操纵的, that the two-party system 两党制 doesn't offer enough choices, that politicians don't do what they promise, that the act of voting itself is confusing or difficult to access 难以参与, and ultimately that their vote doesn't matter. So why bother? Does your vote really matter?

==== ​Introducing the Guests
To help explore and answer this question, I've invited two of my governance studies colleagues 同事 to the show. First, Keshia Middlemass, a fellow 研究员 and associate professor 副教授 of American politics and public policy 公共政策 at Howard University. She's the author of the award-winning book Convicted and Condemned: The Politics and Policies of Prisoner Reentry 囚犯重返社会. Then, I'll talk with senior fellow 高级研究员 John Vant, director of the Brown Center on Education Policy 教育政策. He specializes in pre-K through 12 education policy and politics, including inequities 不平等 in U.S. schools.

==== ​Discussion with Keshia Middlemass: Does Your Vote Matter?
Keshia, welcome to Democracy in Question.
Thank you so much for having me, Katie. It's my pleasure.

Let's start off at the top: Does my vote really matter?
Recent history says yes, your vote does matter. Within the United States, we have to think about federalism 联邦制 and the jurisdiction 管辖范围 you live in. For instance, in the 2000 presidential election, 538 votes separated George W. Bush and Al Gore. Once the Supreme Court 最高法院 made its decision, George W. Bush was awarded the Electoral College votes 选举人票 for Florida, which allowed him to become president. In recent congressional elections 国会选举, you can see house members winning by small margins 微弱优势. In 2022, Republican John James won Michigan's 10th District by 1,600 votes, and Republican Zach Nunn in Iowa's 3rd Congressional District won by just over 2,100 votes. You're looking at fewer than 22,200 people determining the actual majority in the House of Representatives 众议院. I bet if you even went to local elections—like for mayors 市长 or city councils 市议会—you might find even smaller margins. Indeed, you will find in some elections they are differentiated by a few hundred votes. In school board elections 学校董事会选举 and city council elections, those few hundred people, if you swing the vote 改变投票结果 a different way, actually have a different outcome.

==== ​Beyond Election Outcomes: Why Voting Matters
Apart from thinking that your vote will have a consequential influence 重大影响 on the outcome, there are lots of other reasons why you should vote too. Can you talk about those?
Yes, besides the outcome of elections, elected officials 民选官员 make so many determinations 决定 about our lives. The media tends to focus on presidential elections and big-picture items 宏观议题 like determining negotiations between Hamas and Israel or whether individuals will have their student loans forgiven—which the Supreme Court has just overturned 推翻. There are big national issues that tend to be eligible only for the president to address, but our lives are affected by who gets elected for mayor and city council. For instance, when we think about police budgets 警察预算 that go up year after year, it is the mayor and city council members who are deciding and signing the contracts for police. Those individuals can have a bigger impact on our daily lived experiences 日常生活体验 than a presidential election.

I would also imagine that, ideally in a democracy like ours, you want people to feel like their vote matters—like they are part of the system, included, and enfranchised 享有选举权. How could we go about improving or increasing that sense of belongingness 归属感?
That is probably one of the toughest questions: How do you belong to a society or community in which you live, where your family is? Part of it, of course, is through your vote. When you mention John coming on later and doing civic engagement 公民参与, civic engagement is about what you care about—what issues you really care about. Let's say someone is really interested in climate change 气候变化 and the impact the environment is having on our lived experiences. What can that young person, their family, or something they could do via their social interactions—be it at church or through any organization they're affiliated with 隶属的—do to clean up a river or a park in their local community? That could have a positive impact. By the sheer act of participating 参与, you can improve your own surroundings 周围环境 and your own life going forward into the future.




==== Why Young Voters Don’t Turn Out
Why is it the case that when you look at data 数据 about who votes and who doesn’t vote longitudinally 纵向地, the numbers and graph lines 图表曲线 are very predictable 可预测的? Basically 基本上, the younger you are, the less likely you turn out 投票, and with each increasing cohort 群体 of age, voter participation 投票参与度 goes up. Can we talk a little bit about young voters 年轻选民? Yes, of course. Young voters tend not to vote for multiple reasons 多种原因. If you think about a young voter who leaves their family home 家庭住所 and goes away to college 大学, there’s an election 选举, and they’ve got a different address—they have to re-register 重新登记. Registration 登记 is a hurdle 障碍. Then, if you graduate 毕业 and go to graduate school 研究生院 or move for another job, you now have a new address and have to re-register again. The registration process 登记流程 can really alienate 使疏远 individuals. There are also efforts to suppress 压制 college voters because they tend to be more left-leaning 左倾的 and liberal 自由派的 and vote Democrat 民主党 when they do vote. Suppression efforts 压制手段 tighten IDs—photo IDs 带照片身份证—so college students aren’t able to use a college ID 学生证, which has their current location 当前位置, versus their driver’s license 驾照, which may be from another state, to register to vote. That’s one challenge 挑战 individuals have. If you’re gone for three or four years, you should change your state driver’s license, but a lot of students don’t. They may never have any intention 意图 to move permanently 永久地 to Indiana or Texas or wherever they’re going to college. Are there other reasons they don’t vote? Do they also have low levels of political efficacy 政治效能感 where they feel like their vote doesn’t matter? Yes, this whole idea of a vote not mattering—unfortunately, the barrage 连串攻击 of misinformation 虚假信息 and disinformation 不实信息 since before 2020 has really dampened 削弱 their spirit 积极性. However, there is data that demonstrates 表明 that since 2008 and the election of Obama, younger voters are excited and will turn out, register, and vote when they’re excited about the candidates 候选人. That is a challenge we have in general 总体上 in America. There are lots of Boomers 婴儿潮一代 who are still in elected office 民选职位, and younger voters are sort of like, “This person’s been there for 30 years; maybe it’s time for new blood 新鲜血液.” Then the electoral system 选举制度, for multiple reasons, allows individuals to get reelected 连任 over and over again. Part of this is just general excitement 普遍热情. Second is also this idea of who I am voting for and what they can do for me. Young people in that age bracket 年龄段 of 18 to 29 care about housing 住房, getting a job, health care costs 医疗费用, reproductive freedom 生育自由, and the environment 环境. When a political party 政党 can address their issues 解决问题 directly, they feel more inclined 倾向于 to vote. It’s that combination 结合 of who the candidate is and what that candidate is communicating 传达 to them that they care about.

==== Barriers to Voting and Possible Solutions
Thinking about these younger voters, you mentioned that it’s difficult to register and there are barriers to entry 准入门槛. It seems to me that some of those are easy fixes 容易解决的. For instance, if your child goes to school in North Carolina, both campaigns 竞选活动 could go down to the campuses 校园 and have young voters walk around with clipboards 写字板 and register students to vote. In theory 理论上, registration to vote is to ensure 确保 that you are eligible 有资格的 to vote, but registration practices 登记制度 in the United States are also a restrictive measure 限制性措施. Some jurisdictions 司法管辖区 have same-day registration 当日登记; some, like Oregon, have complete mail-in ballots 邮寄选票 where you don’t even have to go to the polls 投票站. Other states have the ability to do early voting 提前投票 so that there’s time before the actual election day in November to cast a ballot 投票. You don’t have to be rushed 匆忙, worry about missing work 耽误工作, or picking up a child after school. They have some flexibility 灵活性. But those efforts are also hampered 阻碍 by individuals who don’t want to expand the electorate 选民群体. In the best-case scenario 最理想情况, there would be same-day registration, you could use a picture ID issued by the government 政府颁发, and then you could cast a ballot. Unfortunately, because of federalism 联邦制 and states having the ability to set different rules 制定不同规则 for registration within their own state, we have multiple rules for different jurisdictions, and that’s where the confusion 混乱 comes in. I have heard a lot of interesting ideas about turning Election Day 选举日 into a holiday 假期, which would be great—it might turn into three-day weekends 三天周末 for people—but it’s unclear 尚不明确. It’s interesting to point out and highlight 强调 those barriers. When you’re older, you find time to register and do all those things, but even early voting is such a huge convenience 巨大便利 in the sense that you can avoid the long lines 长队 on Election Day. I’m sure that turnout rates 投票率 are much higher in those states. Yes, and it’s not just the long lines. Long lines are an actual product 实际产物 of bad maintenance 维护不善 of election equipment 选举设备 that is only pulled out 取出 every two years. Long lines are also part of election administration 选举管理, where jurisdictions aren’t investing in new equipment or fixing the equipment they do have. It’s understandable 可以理解 because it only happens every two or four years, and there are other more pressing needs 更紧迫需求. But you also have to think about this idea of what it means to vote and why the United States isn’t making it easier. Studies have shown there are generational or age cohorts. We’ve been talking about 18 to 29, which would be Gen Z Z世代, if I’m getting my generations correct. They are the more liberal generation—more liberal than Millennials 千禧一代, who are more liberal than Gen X X世代, who are more liberal than Boomers. As each generation comes of age 成年 to vote, they will likely be more liberal, which scares 使害怕 people who are not left-leaning Democratic voters. Whoever controls the machinery of voting 选举机制—the registration process, early voting, same-day registration, mail-in ballots—those individuals are then able to determine 决定 who is eligible and able to vote. They can try to tinker at the margins 边缘调整 on what turnout will look like.

==== Close Elections and the Electoral College
Talking about tinkering at the margins, Biden won several states in 2020 because he was able to win Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Wisconsin by approximately 1% or less—about 10,000 votes total. Studies have shown that if 143,000 voters in those three states changed their votes, Trump would have been president in 2020. In 2016, less than 50,000 votes, if they had changed across three or four states, would have made Hillary Rodham Clinton president. Back to the original question: Does your vote matter? A lot of elections are won by very small margins 微弱优势. The interesting thing about U.S. elections, though, is that while there are close margins among states, in reality, it’s maybe seven out of 50 states—maybe 10 out of 50 states—that are what we call swing states 摇摆州, where the outcome 结果 will determine who wins the Electoral College 选举人团. I could see young people saying, “This is an absurd system 荒谬的制度; why don’t we have a national vote 全国普选?” But we do have the Electoral College. We have a Constitution 宪法 that’s really difficult to amend 修订. That’s unlikely to happen 不太可能发生. It seems to me that you mentioned earlier the importance of having a younger candidate—at least not a Boomer, but younger than a Boomer—that they can relate to 产生共鸣 better, and then having issues that they really care about. The combination of a younger candidate and the issues strikes me as something that would probably drive up turnout 提高投票率 within that cohort. Is that accurate 准确? I think so, yes. When we think about 2008 and President Obama—pre-President Obama, Senator Obama—running for the presidency 竞选总统 in 2008, he brought a type of energy 活力 to the electorate 选民群体 that people hadn’t seen before, not just because he was the first Black man to become the nominee 提名人 of the Democratic Party, but because he was able to talk a language and speak about policies 政策 in a way younger people understood. The same happened, of course, when he was reelected 连任 in 2012. When we start thinking about younger candidates, I think about Hakeem Jeffries, who is the minority leader 少数党领袖 in the United States House of Representatives for the Democratic Party. He was able to capture the imagination 激发想象力 of younger people. He is able to speak their language 用他们的语言说话 and cares about their issues, but he’s also going to platforms 平台 where young people are. He’s tweeting 发推文, he posts on Facebook—I know Facebook’s not for young people—but his staff will post things on Instagram. Part of it is not just using traditional media 传统媒体 but meeting people where they are to educate them about what is going on. These candidates who are running for office 竞选公职 need to work at it if they want to get the youth vote 青年选票 out. They need to find ways to connect with them. Elected officials 民选官员 could help by changing the registration laws 登记法律.








==== Registration as a Key Barrier
Do you think that’s the biggest barrier 最大障碍? Among the many reasons they don’t vote, is that, to you, the most influential 最具影响力的? It is one that I have seen. Being at Howard University 霍华德大学, a lot of students are coming from outside the DMV area (D.C./Maryland/Virginia)—from other states. They try to register in their home state 家乡州 and get an absentee ballot 缺席选票. Sometimes the absentee ballot arrives late. I know from studies done by political scientists 政治学者 that absentee ballots aren’t always counted 被统计. Then, back to the moving—when young people move, every time you move to a new address, or when women get married and change their name, they have to get a new ID 身份证 and re-register. Sometimes it seems like registering should be easy, and it’s easy when you live at the same address and your name doesn’t change, but there are ways to make it more complicated—self-inflicted 自我造成的, so to speak. For me, registration is the first hurdle 第一道门槛 that should be addressed to increase voter turnout 提高投票率. You would need to lobby 游说 state by state in order to achieve that goal, unfortunately.

==== Youth Turnout and the Health of Democracy
A lot of times, people think that when voting participation is down—especially if it’s down in a particular key cohort 关键群体—that’s a bad sign 不良征兆 or a bad indicator of the health of our democracy 民主健康状况. When you think about lower turnout among the youth vote, do you think that’s a bad sign for our democracy? I usually ask all my guests this question: On a scale of 1 to 10, how worried are you about the future of American democracy? A little background on me: I’m an institutionalist 制度主义者. I believe in institutions 制度 and the power of institutions. I am nervous about potential current reactions to election outcomes, but I’m not worried about American democracy and the future of American democracy. I feel that institutions and the people in them will be able to continue to protect the ballot 选票 and the ability of Congress to do its job. Yes, there are moments in time where we may not like the decisions institutions make, but the fact is that the institutions and the people in them will be able to at least support the idea of democracy and allow American democracy to go forward into the future. We’ve definitely had some rocky spots 坎坷时期 in our history, but we can overcome. Where would you be on that scale of 1 to 10 in terms of how worried you are about the future? It sounds like you’re pretty low. I’m pretty low—let’s say a 4. There are some challenges, but I’m not overly concerned 过度担忧. Thank you so much for coming to the show and talking about this fascinating issue. I might want to talk to you after the election too because I am curious to see what happens in this election in terms of the youth vote and their participation rates 参与率. Thank you for having me, Katie. I’d love to come back.

==== Discussion with John Vant: Education and Voting
Now, John Vant, who, in addition to his leadership of the Brown Center, also studies the politics of education 教育政治学, examining issues related to public opinion 舆论, partisan politics 党派政治, and the goals of public education 公共教育目标. John, welcome to Democracy in Question. Glad to be here. We just heard from our guest and your colleague—our colleague—Keshia Middlemass. We talked about young voters and why they might not want to vote. Does my vote matter? Of course, your vote matters, but despite the easy answer to that question, I would think it’s hard to encourage younger voters to turn out. I think your background and scholarship 学术研究 tie nicely to this question. Could you talk a little bit about how education plays a role in these ideas and people’s mindset 心态 about whether their vote matters? Sure, it’s really a two-part question 两部分问题. First, why is it that young people vote at lower rates than others? There are a lot of reasons for that. We know from research that some of it has to do with habits 习惯. Voting is a habit you form over time, and young people just haven’t had as many opportunities to go and vote. Many young people who don’t vote now might vote more in the future. Some of it is about barriers—it’s just too hard to vote in this country. One of the big barriers when it comes to voting is registering to vote. Sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds haven’t registered to vote yet. We’ve seen some progress when you have pre-registration 预先登记 or same-day registration—measures that get students up and ready so they can just vote when they’re of age 达到法定年龄. Then, there are some motivational issues 动机问题 too. A lot of young people look at our politics and government and just don’t see themselves in it—they don’t see a place for themselves. That’s particularly true for certain groups of young voters. A lot of that, I think, is because our schools haven’t done their fair share 应尽责任 in preparing students to be good citizens 良好公民. This is the second part of that question: Schools have to prepare students not just to vote once—it’s not just the act of voting—but to contribute to a strong democracy 强大民主 and a cohesive society 凝聚力社会. That is really a primary function 主要功能 of our public education system, and it’s one that, over time, I would argue we’ve started to neglect 忽视.

==== Pre-Registration and Schools’ Role
You mentioned that 16- and 17-year-olds haven’t registered to vote, but I thought they couldn’t vote until they were 18. That’s right—they can’t vote until they’re 18, although there are exceptions to that. In my hometown, Takoma Park, Maryland, you can actually vote in municipal elections 市政选举 at age 16 or 17. But it is true that in federal elections 联邦选举, you have to be 18 years old to vote. Now, some states—in fact, many states—actually allow pre-registration so that you can register to vote before you turn 18. When you turn 18, it’s one less hurdle that confronts you before you actually vote. It’s kind of advanced registration 提前登记 to make it easier when you’re off at college or wherever you might be. That’s right, and schools have an important role to play when it comes to registering students because a lot of kids turn 18 when they’re in their senior year of high school 高中毕业班. Most states either allow or require schools to provide some kind of voter registration materials 选民登记材料 to students as they’re turning 18 years old. Whether schools actually do it has been very uneven 参差不齐. Even in states that have relatively strong requirements 相对严格的要求 to get students up and running so they can vote, we’ve seen that a lot of schools just don’t do it, or districts 学区 don’t prioritize it 不优先处理.


==== STEM vs. Civic Education
I’m wondering if you know better than I do, but it seems to me that the emphasis 强调 on STEM education—science, technology, engineering, and mathematics—has that come at the cost of marginalizing 边缘化 the education directed at civic education 公民教育? That’s a great question. I wouldn’t put them as competing 相互竞争 because I think a STEM education is really important, and in lots of ways, building civics education 公民教育 and building STEM education can be compatible 兼容的. But it is the case that the goals we have seen collectively as a country for our education system have evolved 演变 over time. We’ve come to a point now where we have what I would argue is a very narrow-minded view 狭隘观点 of schools: that they prepare students to be productive workers 高效劳动者, preparing students for career or college. We really have lost sight of 忽视 what was a core function 核心功能 of schools as we saw them early on, which was to prepare students to be good citizens who are contributing members of society 社会贡献者. If you’ll allow me just a second of history—I was just going to ask you to explain the historical arc 历史脉络 of public education in America and if it started with this emphasis on becoming a good citizen. It did, yes. A lot of the early purpose of education was really assimilating citizens 同化公民—new citizens to the country—and trying to bring in new communities and have this cohesive society 凝聚力社会 here in the U.S. Over time, schools tend to take on the problems of the country and have generally tried to address those problems.

==== A Nation at Risk and Shifting Priorities
The pivot 转向 that is most defining for what our schools do now came in the early 1980s—in 1983. There was a report issued by the Reagan administration called A Nation at Risk 《危机中的国家》. What it did was set off a lot of alarms 拉响警报 that we were losing our economic competitiveness 经济竞争力 relative to other countries because we weren’t developing the academic skills 学术技能 we needed to develop and weren’t preparing students to enter the workforce 劳动力市场 with those skills. What was the evidence they brought to bear to show that? My memory of the early 1980s was not of an economic collapse 经济崩溃 or a huge trade imbalance 贸易逆差—what was the catalyst 催化剂 for producing such a report? What was really extraordinary about the report was how little it was actually based on. It pointed to some test scores 考试成绩 comparing U.S. students to students internationally, but really, it was the rhetorical flourish 华丽辞藻 of the report. It spoke in very scary language 危言耸听, and I think even the authors didn’t expect it to have the impact that it had, but it did. It set in Americans’ minds this idea that we’re falling way far behind 远远落后 when it comes to preparing workers. It set us down this path where, for the next few decades—really until the modern day—the infrastructure 基础设施 we’ve built in education policy is all organized around creating academic standards 学术标准 in subjects that are important and relatively easy to measure, like math and English language arts. We build these standards and say, “Okay, students in third grade, this is what they have to know; when they move to fourth grade, this is what they have to know.” Then we’ve built testing around those standards. Students go into school, they’re tested on how well they master the standards, and schools might be rewarded or punished 奖励或惩罚 based on how well their students have mastered those standards. When you build an accountability system 问责制度 like that, focused on a couple of subjects, schools tend to redirect all their attention to those subjects. That’s what we’ve seen over the last few decades. Our public education system has really focused on numeracy 计算能力 and literacy 读写能力, which are absolutely core functions of schools, and preparing students to be workers is absolutely a core function of schools. But what isn’t being measured and isn’t part of any of those accountability systems—the collective priorities 集体优先事项 we’ve set for schools—is preparing students for a democracy. That, I think, has changed a great deal in recent decades, where our education policy and practice really just hasn’t kept up 跟上.

==== Impact of Testing and Accountability
It’s kind of astonishing 令人惊讶, but maybe it shouldn’t be surprising, that when you change the incentives 激励机制 at the national level or even at the local levels, it trickles down 渗透 such that schools need to teach for the test 应试教学. Resources are allocated 分配 according to their performance on those tests—their students’ performance. That will shape the behavior in terms of the curriculum 课程设置, and subjects that are less rewarded, like arts or things having to do with civics and maybe history, find their way lower and lower on the priority list 优先级列表. What’s interesting to me too is that this one report issued in the early ‘80s wasn’t challenged later. I know the next president was President Bush, also a Republican, but you would have thought that the Clinton administration and the relatively newly established Department of Education 教育部, established in the Carter administration, might have wanted to change the script 改变剧本, so to speak, and have our public schools focus less on testing. I agree there should be some accountability, but there’s probably a middle road 中间道路 where you test students occasionally but don’t focus all aspects of the school itself on a test. I think that’s right, and that really is where we’ve been. The politics of education 教育政治 are a little bit different from politics in some other fields. We actually had a reasonably strong bipartisan coalition 两党联盟 that drove a lot of those education reforms 教育改革 of the past few decades. One part of it is this test-based accountability 基于测试的问责制 we’re talking about. The other part is certain forms of school choice 择校制度 that let families pick the schools their kids attend, which for a long time was charter schools 特许学校—publicly funded 公共资助的, kind of privately run schools 私营运营 that are still part of the public education system and governed by a lot of the rules that govern public schools.






==== School Choice and Vouchers
You’re talking about vouchers 教育券 too? Vouchers are the very contemporary reincarnation 现代翻版 of that, and that is a particularly important question for this moment. When we had this bipartisan coalition 两党联盟, you had conservatives 保守派 who, for a long time, really liked school choice policy 择校政策. They saw in it this opportunity to bring market reforms 市场改革 to education, where only the schools that are the most appealing and successful will thrive 蓬勃发展, and other schools will close. You’ll have parents as consumers 家长作为消费者 making decisions. You had Democrats 民主党人 who had a very different vision for what schools should be. Some parts of the Democratic Party were open to the idea of school choice, but it was more focused on the inherent unfairness 内在不公平 that if you have money to choose where you live or which private school your kid attends, you have some form of school choice, but for some families, they just can’t afford to make that choice. We had this compromise 妥协方案 for a long time, which was that we would have some kind of school choice policy, but it would take the form of school choice within the public sector 公共部门. You could pick from schools across your district, or it would be these charter schools—quasi-private 准私立的. Now, what’s happened in the last few years is, as we’ve started to see more polarization 两极分化 in politics in general and in the politics of education in particular, Democrats got sick of 厌倦 the idea of charter schools and backed away from 退出 that. Republicans have moved toward these very large-scale private school voucher programs 大规模私立学校教育券计划. This is really happening just in the last few years. What these programs do is offer essentially all families in the states that have passed these policies—about a dozen states—the opportunity to take public funds 公共资金 and use them to pay for private school tuition 私立学校学费 or certain approved educational expenses 核准教育支出. There’s essentially no Democratic support for that idea, and actually, there’s some opposition among Republicans too. What that does, when we’re thinking about the impacts of that for democracy, is it essentially removes any opportunity for a government role to shape what students know and any ability for us to ensure that there’s some baseline of core skills 核心技能, knowledge, and disposition 素养 that students have as we’re preparing them to be citizens. In these places that have moved in that direction, we are very much moving away from a model that takes seriously that schools are really the public institutions we have for instilling 灌输 those skills that people will ultimately need to be contributing members of our society and democracy.

.对教育, 两党的折中政策
这段内容涉及到美国“教育选择”（school choice）政策的演变, 和背后的政治妥协。

*这个“折中方案”背后，是两种政治力量——保守派（通常是共和党）和自由派（通常是民主党）——对“教育选择”的不同理解和诉求：*

[.my3]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]
|===
| 保守派(共和党) 的立场： |部分自由派（民主党内一部分）的立场：

|- 目标： *推动市场化的优胜劣汰改革。*
- 理由： 他们支持“教育选择”，希望用**市场机制（市场竞争、家长做消费者）**来提高学校质量。
- 逻辑： 最好的学校生存，不好的学校会自然关闭。
- 关键词： 家长选择、竞争、效率、自由市场。

|- 目标： *促进教育公平。*
- 理由： 他们看到有钱人已经可以选择私校或优质学区，但低收入家庭没有选择权。
- 逻辑： *教育选择也应惠及穷人，但不能摧毁公共教育。*
- 关键词： 公平、机会、弥补结构性不平等。

*于是形成的折中政策： 实现一定程度的“教育选择”，但局限在"公共系统内部"：* +
-> 可以在学区内, 跨校选择； +
-> *支持"特许学校"（Charter Schools）：这些学校虽然由私人运营，但依旧用公款资助，受到政府监管。* +
总结这个折中的逻辑：
既满足保守派希望“引入竞争”的想法，又不彻底放弃公共教育体系中对公平的承诺。

*这样的折中政策导致了什么后果？*

|第二阶段（最近几年）：
|- *折中破裂：两党对教育的看法出现极大分裂。*
- *民主党越来越反感"特许学校"(私人运营, 国家有补助)，担心它们削弱公共教育。*
- *共和党转向全面支持"私校代金券"（vouchers）计划，把公款直接用于私校或家庭教育。*
|===

*由此引发的后果：*

- *去公共化：教育越来越被“外包”给私人机构，政府难以统一管理。*
- *不平等加剧：穷人拿不到实质上的帮助，富人却能借机获得财政补贴。*
- *民主基础受损：教育不再是全民共享的“公民培训场所”，而是变成“阶层分化的温床”。*


.私校代金券”（School Vouchers）
*什么是“私校代金券”（School Vouchers）？*
简而言之：
*政府把原本用来资助"公立学校"的公共资金，转而给到学生家庭，用于支付"私立学校"的学费, 或其他教育相关支出。* +
也可以理解为—— *本来这笔钱是直接拨给"公立学校"的； 现在这笔钱变成一张“教育券”，家长可以自己决定怎么用，甚至是用在宗教学校、私校、线上教育, 或家庭教育上。*

|初衷与支持者的主张:
|主要支持者：保守派政客、市场自由主义者、宗教团体。

他们的主张包括：

- 家长应有“教育自由”：父母应能决定孩子上哪种学校，而不是被学区限制。
- 引入市场机制，提高教育效率：让学校“竞争生存”，不好就倒闭，提升整体质量。
- *帮助低收入家庭“逃离失败的公校”：理论上，让穷人也能负担得起"私立教育"。*
- **避免政府干预价值观：**例如在性别、宗教、种族教育上的争议——有些家长希望避开“进步派课程”。

主要问题与批评 : 现在我们讲重点——这个政策到底有什么问题？

[.my3]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]

|Header 1 |Header 2
|1.并不能真正帮到穷人
|表面上是“帮穷人选择”，但实际上：

- *代金券金额有限，往往不足以覆盖私立学校的全部学费；*
- *有钱家庭可以自己“补差价”，穷人还是进不去；* 最终使用代金券最多的群体, 是中产甚至富人。研究显示，voucher 政策的主要受益人群, 是本来就打算上"私立学校"的那些家庭，只是现在可以少花钱。

|2.掏空公共教育系统的经费
|
- 公立学校资金, 按学生人数拨款；
- *学生走了，钱也走了，但(公立)学校的固定支出还在（校舍、教师、设施）；*
- *导致留在公校的学生（往往是低收入家庭）面对更糟糕的教育环境(因为无法获取到足够的政府资助资金, 优秀老师出走)，恶性循环。*

*“削弱式改革”：不是修补原来的系统，而是让它(公立学校)慢慢失血、变差。*

|3.*政府失去监管权力*
|*私校使用代金券，却往往不受国家课程大纲、师资资格、测试标准等约束：*

- 政府无法统一设定教学目标；
- 学生在不同体系里, 接受完全不同, 甚至相互冲突的教育. 宗教学校或极端保守/自由学校，还可能传授排外、歧视、伪科学等内容。*原本“公立学校是民主公民训练场”，现在可能变成了“思想分裂的工厂”。*

|4.教育变成一种“私人商品”, 而非“公共事业”
|这是最深层的问题：

- **教育**不再是国家为了每一个孩子、每一个未来公民的普遍承诺；而**变成“谁付得起，谁就上好学”的买卖**；
- 导致"社会阶层"进一步固化，教育分裂种族、阶级、信仰等群体；
- 私立学校更重视就业, 丧失培养公共责任感。破坏了民主基础：共同价值观的流失.
|===

总结一下私校代金券的主要问题清单：

- 公校资源流失	把钱从公立系统挪走，削弱公校质量
- 补贴富人	穷人难以实际享用，富人却省钱了
- 失控的教育质量	政府无法统一监管，质量参差不齐
- 加剧不平等	教育成阶层壁垒，阻碍社会流动
- 破坏民主素养	缺少统一基础教育，损害民主公民训练
-  伪改革掩盖问题	转移焦点，不解决真正的问题如贫困、资源不均

==== Characteristics of Voucher States
Are there similarities between these 12 states? Are they regionally similar, or how would you describe them? Could you characterize them politically? They lean Republican 倾向共和党, although there are a couple of purple states 摇摆州. Arizona was the first state that really pushed all-in on this, and I think it’s the most fundamental change 根本性变革 in the core foundation of how we govern and run schools, certainly in my lifetime. It’s happening very quickly. Some of these states are just now seeing what the implications are of turning education over to the private sector 私营部门 and starting to back away from public education systems. A whole lot more states are about to find out what the effects of that move are before even these initial early adopters 早期采用者 get to a point where they can show anything. It’s happening so quickly and without any real evidence to guide what’s going on. The very early evidence we have suggests a whole lot of problems. For example, some of my colleagues and I have been looking at who benefits from these programs. It’s by and large 大体上 wealthy families that are getting these private school vouchers because often the voucher isn’t enough money to actually pay for private school tuition. If you’re a wealthy family, you’re taking this money from the state and might have to top that off 补足差额 and pay the rest of the tuition. But if you’re one of those low-income families who were, in theory at least, part of the motivation for some of these programs, they might not be able to pay that difference. It’s not that it creates new opportunities—there’s a real risk that what’s going to happen with all of this is that we’ll have some very stratified 高度分层的 school education systems in some states. Where we have that stratification, we are losing our grip on 失去控制 our ability to instill some of those skills and dispositions that we really need across the citizenry 全体公民 for democracy.

==== Outsourcing Education and Public Confidence
In a sense, are they outsourcing education 外包教育 at the state level by providing these opportunities? I think that’s definitely one way of thinking about it. In the context of our politics right now, what we’ve seen in the last few years is a real erosion 侵蚀 in attitudes toward K-12 education and the confidence that people have in our public education system. That’s not unusual in the context of American institutions. If you look at polling over time, all American institutions are polling at lower levels of confidence 信心水平下降. It’s particularly true for public schools, and particularly true among Republicans. I think a lot of that has roots in the COVID-19 shutdowns 新冠封锁 and the backlash 强烈反对 that resulted from schools being closed for quite a long time. That backlash first became a push toward some of these culture war battles 文化战争 over critical race theory 批判性种族理论 and transgender students’ rights 跨性别学生权利 that we’re still dealing with in schools. More recently, it has really become a push to poke at 动摇 the foundations of our public education system—to potentially set up this structure outside of public education that is really hostile to 敌视 the public education system that we’ve had for centuries.

==== Ideas for Improving Civic Education
Those are fascinating developments. I’m a pretty careful news reader and hadn’t come across those. Tell me, in your perfect world, what could public education at the state or local level be doing to make better citizens? What are some tangible, concrete ideas 具体可行方案 that you have? There’s a lot that schools can do, and some of it is just hard to measure, so it doesn’t fit with that infrastructure we’ve built up with policy. Just to give a few examples: Our media landscape 媒体环境 has changed very quickly over the last few decades, and our efforts when it comes to media literacy 媒体素养 have not kept up. Making sure that students understand what is real, what is fake, what is a good source of information, and what’s a bad source—and showing them that they can be tricked and duped 被欺骗—is one area of skill-building with direct implications for democracy. Another, a little more abstract but an area I work on and care about, is instilling in students what we would call intellectual humility 知识谦逊. This is essentially the idea that we’re all wrong all the time, we’re all vulnerable 脆弱的, and that’s okay. We should embrace that—it’s part of being human. As a result, you want people to seek out competing perspectives 寻求不同观点 and keep an open mind 保持开放心态 to the idea that I might have this wrong and need to find a new way of doing this. In school, maybe that’s debate—setting up debate where you’re taking a perspective you might not agree with on an issue and really thinking through, “If I were arguing from this side, what would I say?”—keeping an open mind and being able to assess arguments and evidence. In addition to that—it’s a long list—but one more to highlight is that schools have a real role to play in instilling an understanding and belief in our core democratic norms 核心民主准则 and institutions. That’s really where Americans go to learn about our government and democracy. Some of that is about facts—teaching the structure of the U.S. federal government—but a lot of it is ensuring that people understand why we have the system we have and why it matters that we preserve it.




==== Current Civics Education and Socialization
Currently, at what age do they have a civics class 公民课 or start to learn about the Constitution 宪法 and those kinds of topics? It varies quite a bit from place to place because education is locally governed 地方分权管理, and different states, districts, and schools will do things in different ways. Basically 基本上, what you see is that elementary schools 小学 will take baby steps 循序渐进 toward teaching some of that, then it ramps up 逐步加强 in middle school 初中. By high school 高中, you’ll see formal civics classes and government classes where students are really learning about the three branches of government 政府三权分立—what we might remember as government class. Just as important as that, in my view, is that early building of that foundation 基础建设 in elementary school and middle school. For another example, giving students experiences in these baby mini-democratic systems 微型民主体系—so in schools, you might have school government 学生会, student council 学生议会, whatever it is—you’re letting students live in a safe little democracy 小型民主实验 in which they have a voice 表达权. They’re trying to understand how this works and how to feel it out 摸索, and they get to vote. They see themselves in it, they see how it matters, and that can start as early as early elementary school. I would imagine that, in addition to education itself, socialization 社会化 at home plays a big role in terms of citizenship 公民意识. For sure—socialization at home and socialization at school, which actually is another one of those things that has become very difficult in recent years, in large part because of cell phones 手机. One of these issues that is very much of the moment 当前热点 and is not likely to go away anytime soon is that it’s gotten harder for students to socialize 社交互动 in school when they look around and all their classmates are on their phones. That’s true in school, it’s true out of school, but the landscape 环境 for that kind of socialization has changed. Yes, some of it happens at home—from interaction 互动 between parents and kids and kids and siblings 兄弟姐妹—but really, that is one of the core purposes 核心目标 of schools: developing those social-emotional skills 社会情感技能 and creating in kids this ability to make friends, understand how to navigate disagreements 处理分歧 and conflicts 冲突, and all of that. That is absolutely a core function of schooling 教育功能 too. I imagine you’re a supporter of the phone bans 手机禁令 that are occurring in some schools lately? I am, yes.

==== John Vant’s View on Democracy’s Future
A lot of people tie this low voter participation 低投票率 to, or use it as an indicator for 指标, how healthy our democracy is. I’d like to ask my guests at the end of the episode how they feel about American democracy and its future. On a scale of 1 to 10, how nervous are you about the future of American democracy? In your case, I would highlight this recent development of, in a sense, outsourcing 外包 or privatizing education 教育私有化 to some extent—does that in and of itself 本质上 make you a little wary 警惕 about the future of democracy? I am worried about it. When I think about democracy, I think about it in the very long term 长期视角. There are certainly a lot of things we can do right now to solve some very immediate problems 紧迫问题. To my eye 在我看来, the ultimate functioning 最终运作 of our democracy is—the primary input 主要变量 in that is all of us. What are our values 价值观, what do we know, what do we care about, and how do we interact with one another and see one another? When I think about the future of democracy, I think about people—us—and how we are training people to navigate those systems 驾驭体系. I am very worried about that. A lot of that has to do with how quickly the world has changed around us. The way students are interacting with other people, the way they’re getting information about the world, the way they are learning about people who disagree with them—all of that has changed radically 根本性地 over the last few decades. I would argue that in that time, when we were really worried about preparing students for this 21st-century economy 21世纪经济 where we had to be globally competitive 全球竞争力 with workforce issues 劳动力问题, we missed the big point 忽视重点: Our 21st-century democracy looks very different from our 20th-century democracy. Getting people ready to navigate that democracy requires some actual teaching 实际教学. I worry that we still haven’t learned that lesson, and we haven’t learned it at a time when change is only speeding up 加速. I worry too that we adults who are in the system—deep somewhere in our cold, polarized hearts 极化心态—have an understanding of what America is and what our institutions are. We have a sense of the way things were and maybe should be with respect to government and institutions. I worry that young people are growing up in a different environment where they’re hearing different things about those institutions. When we look over the long run 长期来看—whether it’s that technology is changing faster than our educational practice and policy, whether it’s that our norms 规范 are changing and we’re going to feel that with future generations more than with our current generations, or whether we have these really serious attacks 严重冲击 on our public education systems—I am concerned over the long run. Where would you be on that scale from 1 to 10? I will put myself at an 8.5—using a fraction 小数! It’s been a pleasure to talk to you. I’ve learned so much today, and now I know what to read about when I focus on education articles, in terms of those efforts in those 12 states. That’s really fascinating. My pleasure—thank you for your time. Thanks for having me.

==== 凯蒂·邓·坦佩斯特的介绍
大家好，我是凯蒂·邓·坦佩斯特，布鲁金斯学会治理研究的访问学者，同时也是改善政府分支关系与政府职能的卡茨曼项目主任。这里是《民主之问》播客，一档探讨当代美国政治与民主未来的节目。在每一期节目中，我都会向嘉宾提出一个关于民主的不同问题，以便我们更好地理解民主制度的整体框架。当前美国政治风起云涌，包括一场竞争激烈的总统大选，但在这个播客中，我试图探讨更深层的问题：民主如何运作——或者说它应该如何运作。今天这期节目的问题是：我的选票真的重要吗？

投票率统计与趋势

2020年总统选举的适龄选民投票率约为66%，是历史最高水平之一，但这意味着有三分之一的美国人根本没有投票。在过去一个世纪的大多数总统选举中，近半数合格选民, 选择不参与投票。**初选、中期选举, 和地方选举的投票率, 往往更低。**历史趋势表明，**年龄越小的, 投票可能性越低。18至29岁的选民投票率, 始终低于50%，是所有年龄组中最低的。不投票者给出的理由包括：选举被操纵、两党制缺乏选择、政客不兑现承诺、投票过程本身令人困惑或难以参与，**以及最终认为自己的选票无关紧要。既然如此，何必费这个劲？你的选票真的重要吗？

==== 嘉宾介绍

为了帮助探讨和回答这个问题，我邀请了两位治理研究同事参与节目。首先是霍华德大学美国政治与公共政策副教授凯西亚·米德尔马斯，她是获奖著作《定罪与谴责：囚犯重返社会的政治与政策》的作者。随后，我将与布朗中心教育政策主任、高级研究员约翰·万特对话，他专攻从"学前"到"12年级"的教育政策与政治，包括美国学校教育中的不平等问题。

==== 与凯西亚的对话：选票重要吗？

凯西亚，欢迎来到《民主之问》。​ +
非常感谢邀请，凯蒂。这是我的荣幸。

让我们直入主题：我的选票真的重要吗？

近期历史表明，是的，**你的选票确实重要。在美国这个联邦制国家，我们需要考虑你所在的"具体司法管辖区"。**例如2000年总统大选中，乔治·W·布什和阿尔·戈尔, 仅相差538张选票。当最高法院作出裁决后，佛罗里达州的选举人票, 归属小布什，这使他最终成为总统。在最近的国会选举中，众议员的"胜选优势", 往往很小——*2022年密歇根第10选区的共和党人约翰·詹姆斯, 以1600票优势胜出，爱荷华第3选区的共和党人扎克·纳恩仅领先2100多票。这意味着不到22,200人就决定了众议院的实际多数席位。我敢说, 如果看地方选举——比如市长或市议会选举——差距可能更小。事实上，有些选举结果仅相差几百票。在校董会和市议会选举中，这几百人如果改变投票意向，就会真正改变选举结果。*

==== 超越选举结果：投票的多重意义

除了认为选票能对结果产生重大影响外，**投票还有许多其他理由。**能谈谈这些吗？

是的，除了选举结果，**民选官员对我们的日常生活, 有诸多决定权。**媒体往往聚焦总统选举和重大议题，比如哈马斯与以色列的谈判，或是学生贷款减免计划——尽管最高法院刚刚推翻了该计划。*有些重大国家议题确实只有总统能处理，#但我们的生活更受市长和市议员的影响。比如逐年增长的警察预算，正是由市长和市议会成员决定, 并签署合同。这些官员对我们日常生活的影响, 可能比总统选举更直接。#*

我认为, *在一个理想的民主制度中，应该让民众感到自己的选票举足轻重*——感到自己是体制的一部分，被包容且享有权利。我们该如何提升这种归属感？

这可能是最棘手的问题：**如何在你生活并养育家庭的社会或社区中, 找到归属感？部分答案当然是通过投票。**你提到稍后约翰会谈到公民参与，**"公民参与"关乎你真正关心的议题。**假设有个年轻人特别关注气候变化, 及其对生活的影响，**这个年轻人、他的家庭, 或通过社交网络（无论是教会还是其他组织）, 能做些什么来清理当地社区的河流或公园？这就能产生积极影响。**通过参与这个简单的行动，你就能改善自身环境, 并为未来创造更好的生活。

==== 年轻选民为何不投票

为什么纵向分析投票数据时，投票者与非投票者的数据图表走势, 非常可预测？根本上，年龄越小, "投票可能性"越低，而随着年龄层递增，投票率逐步上升。能谈谈年轻选民吗？

当然可以。年轻选民不投票有诸多原因。**设想一个离开家庭去外州读大学的年轻人：遇到选举时，他们地址已变——必须重新登记。登记本身就是一道门槛。若毕业后读研或换工作，新地址又需再次登记。**登记流程确实令人疏离。此外，**有人刻意压制大学生选民，因他们倾向左翼自由派, 且投票给民主党。压制手段包括严查带照片身份证——大学生不能用"现住址的学生证"登记投票，**而驾照可能是外州签发的。这是年轻人面临的一个挑战。若离乡三四年，本应更换本州驾照，但许多学生不这么做，可能从未打算永久移居印第安纳或德州等求学地。

还有其他不投票原因吗？是否因"政治效能感"低, 而认为投票无意义？

是的，"投票无用论"盛行——遗憾的是，2020年前后的**虚假信息轰炸, 严重削弱了他们的积极性。**但有数据显示，自2008年奥巴马当选后，年轻选民对候选人感到兴奋时, 会积极登记投票。这是美国普遍存在的挑战。**大量婴儿潮一代仍占据公职，年轻人难免抱怨"这人已任职30年，该换新血了"。而选举制度因多重原因, 允许官员反复连任。**部分源于普遍的热情缺失，部分关乎选民对候选人及其政见的认同。*18-29岁群体关注住房、就业、医疗成本、生育自由和环境议题。当政党直接回应这些关切时，他们更愿投票。候选人的年龄层与议题的结合, 才是关键。*

==== 投票障碍与解决方案
谈及年轻选民，你提到登记困难和准入门槛。其中有些问题似乎容易解决。例如，若子女就读北卡罗来纳州，两党竞选团队, 可到校园用写字板帮学生登记投票。

理论上，选民登记是为确保资格，但美国的登记制度, 实为限制措施。有些州实行"当日登记"；俄勒冈等州采用全邮寄选票，无需亲临投票站；其他州允许"提前投票"，避免选举日匆忙。这为选民提供灵活性——不必担心误工或接孩子放学。但这些措施遭不愿扩大选民群体者阻挠。最理想的情况是：当日登记、使用政府颁发带照身份证、直接投票。但**受联邦制影响，各州自设登记规则，导致跨州规则混乱。**有人提议将"选举日"定为假期——可能形成三天周末——但效果未知。强调这些障碍很有趣。年长者会抽空登记，但**提前投票的巨大便利在于, 能避开选举日长队。这些州的投票率显然更高。**排长队不仅是"设备维护不善"的产物（设备每两年才启用一次），也因**各州不投资更新选举设备。这可以理解——选举仅每两到四年一次，且有更紧急需求需资金。**但更应反思的是"投票意义", 及美国为何不简化流程。

研究表明, 代际差异存在。我们讨论的**18-29岁属Z世代（若代际划分正确），他们比千禧一代更自由，千禧又比X世代自由，X世代比婴儿潮自由。##随着每代人成年投票，自由倾向将加剧，令非"左翼民主党选民"不安。##掌控选举机制者（登记流程、提前投票、邮寄选票）能决定谁有资格投票，并试图通过边缘调整影响投票率。**

==== 势均力敌的选举与选举人团

说到边缘调整，**拜登2020年因在宾州、佐治亚和威斯康星, 以约1%或更小优势（总计约1万票）获胜。研究显示，若这三个州14.3万选民改投，特朗普将连任。**2016年，若三四个州不到5万票改投，希拉里将当选。回到最初问题：**你的选票重要吗？许多选举以微弱优势决出。**但美国选举的吊诡在于：**#尽管各州差距微小，真正决定"选举人团"归属的"摇摆州", 不过7-10个。年轻人或质疑"这制度荒谬，为何不全民普选？"#, 但"选举人团制度"与"极难修订的宪法", 使其难以改变。**

你之前提到年轻候选人的重要性（至少非婴儿潮一代）——他们更能引发共鸣，且关注青年议题。候选人年龄与议题的结合, 可能提升该群体投票率。是否如此？

我认为是的。回想2008年参议员**奥巴马竞选总统，**他为选民注入前所未有的活力——不仅因他是首位黑人民主党提名者，**更因他用年轻人理解的方式谈论政策。**2012年连任时亦然。谈及年轻候选人，我想到民主党众议院少数党领袖哈基姆·杰弗里斯。**他激发年轻人想象力，用他们的语言说话，关注他们的议题，并活跃于年轻人聚集的平台（发推文、脸书帖——虽脸书非年轻人阵地——团队运营Instagram）。关键不仅是使用传统媒体，更要深入选民所在场景普及政治知识。**想争取青年选票的候选人, 必须努力建立连接，而民选官员可通过修改登记法律, 提供助力。


==== 登记制度是关键障碍

你认为这是最大障碍吗？在众多不投票原因中，这对你来说最具影响力吗？

根据我的观察确实如此。在霍华德大学，许多学生来自华盛顿特区/马里兰/弗吉尼亚地区之外的其他州。*他们尝试在家乡州登记, 并获取"缺席选票"，但有时选票送达过晚。#政治学研究显示，"缺席选票"未必都被统计。#*

再说**迁移问题——年轻人每次搬迁新地址，或女性婚后更名，都需重新办理身份证并登记。看似登记应很简单（若地址姓名不变确实容易），但实际操作可能因"自我设障"变得复杂。我认为要提高投票率，首先需解决登记门槛。**遗憾的是，这需要逐州游说才能实现目标。


==== 青年投票率与民主健康

人们常认为, 投票率下降（尤其是关键群体）, 是民主健康状况的不良征兆。你认为青年投票率低, 对民主是坏信号吗？我通常问嘉宾这个问题：用1-10分评估，你对美国民主未来的担忧程度？ +
先说明我的立场：我是制度主义者，相信制度的力量。虽对当前选举结果的可能反应, 感到不安，但对美国民主的未来, 并不忧虑。我相信制度, 及其从业者能继续保护选票和国会职能。我们可能不认同某些制度决策，但制度和其中的人, 至少会捍卫民主理念，推动美国民主前行。历史上我们经历过坎坷，但总能克服。 +
你的担忧程度是？听起来你不太担忧？

确实较低——大概4分。存在挑战, 但无需过度忧虑。

感谢参与节目讨论这个精彩议题。大选后或许再邀你聊聊青年投票数据。荣幸之至，凯蒂，期待再来。

==== 与约翰·万特的对话：教育与投票

约翰·万特除领导布朗中心外，还研究教育政治学，涉及舆论、党派政治, 和公共教育目标等议题。约翰，欢迎来到《民主之问》。很高兴参与。我们刚听完你同事凯西亚·米德尔马斯的观点，讨论了青年不愿投票的原因。"我的选票重要吗？"当然重要，**但尽管答案简单，鼓励年轻人投票仍非易事。**你的学术背景与此问题高度相关。能否谈谈教育如何影响"投票是否重要"的认知？

这其实是双重问题：第一，**#为何年轻人投票率更低？研究显示, 部分源于"习惯养成"——投票是长期形成的习惯#，**而年轻人缺乏投票机会。当前不投票的年轻人, 未来可能改变。**另部分源于障碍——美国投票太难，其中登记是主要障碍。16-17岁青少年尚未具备登记资格。**但实行"预先登记"或"当日登记"的州, 已取得进展，这些措施能帮助学生达到年龄后直接投票。此外还存在动机问题——许多年轻人审视政治和政府时, 找不到自身定位，某些青年群体尤其如此。我认为主因在于, **学校未尽责培养良好公民。这就引出第二重问题：学校教育不应仅培养"投一次票"的能力，更要为强大民主和凝聚社会做贡献。**这本是公共教育体系的核心功能，但已被逐渐忽视。

==== 预先登记, 与学校职责

*你提到16-17岁青少年未登记，但他们不是18岁才能投票吗？*

没错，**联邦选举确实需年满18岁，但我的家乡**马里兰州塔科马帕克市, *允许16-17岁参与市政选举。实际上许多州允许"预先登记"，这样18岁时就少了一道投票门槛。*

这种提前登记, 能方便学生上大学后投票。

确实如此，学校在帮助学生登记方面至关重要，因为许多学生在高中毕业班, 年满18岁。*多数州要求或允许学校向适龄学生提供登记材料，但执行情况参差不齐。即使在有严格要求的州，许多学校或学区也未优先落实。*


==== STEM教育与公民教育之争

我想请教：**STEM教育（科学/技术/工程/数学）的强势地位，是否挤压了公民教育的发展空间？**

这个问题很深刻。*我不认为二者必然对立*——STEM教育确实重要，而公民教育与STEM教育本, 可兼容。但**美国教育目标确实经历了演变。如今我们对学校的认知变得狭隘：只关注培养学生成为高效劳动者，为其升学就业做准备，却忽视了早期教育的核心功能——培养成为社会贡献者的良好公民。**

能否简述美国公共教育的历史脉络？是否最初就强调培养好公民？

确实如此。*早期教育核心是同化新移民，构建社会凝聚力。随着时间推移，学校逐渐承担起"解决国家问题"的责任。*

==== 《危机中的国家》与教育转向

**当前教育体系的分水岭, 是1983年里根政府发布的《危机中的国家》报告。该报告危言耸听地宣称：因学术技能培养不足，美国正丧失全球经济竞争力。**但当时既无经济崩溃, 也无严重贸易逆差，报告依据何在？令人震惊的是，这份引发巨变的报告, 实际依据极其薄弱——仅引用了一些国际测试成绩对比，更多依靠煽动性语言。它成功植入"美国劳动力培养严重落后"的集体焦虑，**由此开启长达数十年的教育改革：建立以"数学"和"英语"等易测量学科为核心的学术标准体系，**实施"与标准挂钩"的测试，并根据测试成绩, 对学校进行奖惩。**这种问责制度导致学校资源全面倾斜，计算能力与读写能力, 成为绝对重点——虽然这些确是学校核心职能，但未被纳入考核体系的"民主公民培养", 却被逐渐边缘化。**近几十年来，教育政策与实践, 在这方面严重滞后。

==== 应试教育的深远影响

"激励机制的改变"引发"应试教学"现象不足为奇：**测试成绩决定资源分配，自然导致课程设置向考试科目倾斜。艺术、公民学、历史等非重点科目, 优先级持续降低。**耐人寻味的是，这份80年代初的报告, 从未被后续政府挑战——即便克林顿执政时期新成立的教育部（卡特政府设立）也未曾扭转局面。**我认同需要问责制，但应寻求平衡点：适度测试, 而非"让考试主导全部教学"。**教育政治的特殊性在于，过去几十年推动教育改革的是强大的两党联盟：其一是我们讨论的"应试问责制"；其二是"允许家庭择校"的制度（长期以"特许学校"形式存在——接受公共资金但私营运营，仍属公共教育体系, 并遵守相关法规）。


==== 教育券与择校政策

您刚才也提到"教育券"了吗？教育券正是这种政策在当代的最新表现形式，这对当前时刻尤为重要。当我们还保持着两党合作时，保守派长期以来一直非常支持"择校政策"。他们认为, 这是将市场改革引入教育领域的机会——只有最具吸引力和最成功的学校, 才能蓬勃发展，其他学校则会被淘汰。这样家长就能作为消费者做出选择。而民主党人对学校应该是什么样子, 有着截然不同的愿景。**民主党内部有些派系, 对"择校理念"持开放态度，但他们更关注这种政策内在的不公平性——有钱人可以通过选择居住地或私立学校, 来获得某种形式的"择校权"，而有些家庭根本负担不起这种选择。**我们长期以来的折衷方案是：在公共部门内部, 实施某种形式的择校政策，比如允许在"学区内"选择学校，或是选择那些准私立（quasi-private）的特许学校。

但近年来随着政治极化加剧，民主党开始厌倦"特许学校"的理念, 并逐渐退出，共和党则转向大规模"私立学校教育券"计划（large-scale private school voucher programs）。这些计划允许通过政策的约12个州的所有家庭, 使用公共资金, 支付私立学校学费, 或特定核准教育支出。这个想法几乎得不到民主党支持，事实上共和党内也有反对声音。当我们思考这对民主的影响时，这实际上剥夺了政府塑造学生知识体系的机会，也让我们无法确保学生在成为"公民"的过程中, 掌握必要的核心技能、知识和素养。在这些推行教育券的州，我们正在严重偏离"学校是培养民主社会成员所需技能的公共机构"这一核心理念。





==== 实施教育券的州特征

这12个州有什么共同点吗？它们在地域上相似吗？或者说从政治角度如何描述它们？

这些州大多倾向共和党，虽然也包含几个摇摆州。亚利桑那州是第一个全力推行（pushed all-in）这项政策的州，我认为这确实是我有生之年见过的, 对学校管理和运行方式最根本的变革。这一切发生得非常快。有些州才刚刚开始看到将教育交给私营部门的后果，并开始退出公共教育体系。甚至在这些早期采用者能够展示任何成果之前，更多州就将要看到这种转变的影响了。这一切发生得太快，而且没有任何实际证据作为指导。我们掌握的早期证据已经显示出很多问题。例如，我和一些同事一直在研究这些计划的受益者。**大体上，获得私立学校教育券的, 是富裕家庭，因为通常教育券的金额不足以支付私立学校的全部学费。富裕家庭可以从州政府获得这笔钱，然后自己补足差额支付剩余学费。而那些理论上本应受益的低收入家庭，可能无力支付这个差价。**这并没有创造新的机会——真正的风险在于，我们可能会在一些州, 形成"高度分层的学校教育体系"。在这种分层体系中，我们将逐渐丧失向全体公民灌输民主社会所需关键技能和素养的能力。

==== 教育外包与公信力危机

从某种意义上说，这些州通过提供这些机会，是在将教育外包吗？我认为这确实是一种理解方式。在当前政治环境下，**我们看到, 过去几年人们对K-12教育的态度, 和对公立教育体系的信心, 出现了严重滑坡。这在美国机构中并不罕见。如果查看历年民意调查，所有美国机构的公众信心水平都在下降。公立学校尤其明显，**在共和党人中更是如此。我认为, 这很大程度上源于新冠封锁（COVID-19 shutdowns）, 以及学校长期关闭引发的强烈反对。这种反弹最初表现为, 围绕"批判性种族理论"和"跨性别学生权利"（transgender students' rights）的文化战争，现在则演变成动摇我们公立教育体系根基的推动力——试图建立一个真正敌视已有数百年历史的公立教育体系的替代结构。

==== 改进公民教育的建议

这些发展确实引人深思。我平时很关注新闻，但之前没有注意到这些。请告诉我，在您理想中，州或地方层面的公立教育, 应该采取哪些具体可行（tangible, concrete）的措施, 来培养更好的公民？

学校可以做很多事情，虽然有些难以量化评估。举几个例子：**过去几十年, 我们的媒体环境变化极快，但在"媒体素养"方面的努力, 却没有跟上。确保学生能够辨别信息真伪、区分可靠与不可靠的信息来源，并让他们意识到自己也可能被欺骗——这些能力培养对民主有直接影响。**

另一个更抽象但我专注的领域, 是**向学生灌输知识时的谦逊——即认识到我们都会犯错、都有认知局限，**这很正常。我们应该接受这点，这是人性的一部分。**因此##要鼓励人们寻求不同观点，保持开放心态，随时准备承认错误并寻找新方法。在学校里，可以通过辩论训练——让学生就某个议题, 站在自己不认同的立场上来进行思考##："如果我要为这个立场辩护，我会怎么说？"**

此外，**学校在灌输对"核心民主准则和制度"的理解与信念方面, 也扮演着关键角色。(即相当于中国的在学校里的意识形态教育.)**这里不仅是学习联邦政府结构的场所，更要让人们理解, 我们为什么需要现有制度，以及维护它的重要性。


==== 当前公民教育与社交化

*学生从几岁开始上公民课, 或学习宪法相关内容？各地差异很大，因为教育实行"地方分权管理"。基本上，小学会循序渐进教授基础知识，初中逐步加强。到了高中，会有正式的公民课和政府课，学习政府三权分立*——即我们记忆中的"政府课"。我认为**#同样重要的是, 中小学阶段的基础建设。例如让学生体验"微型民主体系"（mini-democratic systems）——通过"学生会"或"学生议会"，让学生在安全的小型民主实验中, 拥有表达权。他们尝试理解体系运作, 并摸索参与方式，还能参与投票。这种教育最早可从小学低年级开始。#**

除学校教育外，家庭社会化, 对公民意识也至关重要。确实如此——但近年来，由于手机普及，家庭和学校的社交互动变得困难。当前热点问题之一是：当学生环顾四周发现同学都在刷手机时，校内外的社交环境已发生变化。家庭中的亲子互动, 和兄弟姐妹交流, 固然存在，但**学校的核心目标, 是培养"社会情感技能"（social-emotional skills），教会学生"处理分歧和冲突"。**您支持近期部分学校实施的手机禁令吗？是的，我支持。


==== 约翰·万特的民主未来观

许多人将低投票率与民主健康度挂钩，或将其视为指标。节目最后我想问：用1-10分评估，您对美国民主未来的担忧程度？考虑到教育外包和私有化趋势，这是否本质上让您对民主前景感到警惕？

我确实担忧。从长期视角看，民主的最终运作, 取决于我们的价值观、知识储备和互动方式。民主的未来关乎我们如何培养公民驾驭体系的能力。**令我深感不安的是世界变化的速度：学生的人际互动方式、信息获取途径、对异议者的认知——这些在过去几十年已发生根本性改变。**当我们忙于为21世纪经济（21st-century economy）培养具有全球竞争力的劳动力时，却忽视重点：**21世纪民主, 与20世纪民主已截然不同。#培养公民适应民主, 需要实际教学，#**而我们在变革加速的时代仍未吸取教训。成年人深陷"极化心态"，对制度有固有认知；**#年轻人却在质疑制度的环境中成长。#**长期来看，技术变革快于教育政策、规范代际差异、公立教育体系受冲击——这些都令我担忧。我的评分是8.5分（使用小数 fraction）。

==== Introduction by Katie Dunn Tempesta

Hi, I'm Katie Dunn Tempesta, a visiting fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution and the director of the Katzman Initiative on Improving Interbranch Relations and Government. This is Democracy in Question, a podcast about contemporary American politics and the future of democracy. In each episode, I ask my guests a different question about democracy so we can better understand the broader contours of our democratic system. There's a lot happening in U.S. politics at the moment, including a highly contested presidential race, but in this podcast, I’m trying to get at the deeper questions of how democracy works—or is supposed to work. On today’s episode, the question is: Does my vote really matter?

==== Voter Turnout Statistics and Trends
The 2020 presidential election had one of the highest voter turnouts as a percentage of the voting-age population, around 66%, but that means a third of Americans didn’t vote at all. In most presidential elections over the past century, nearly half of eligible voters sat elections out. Participation in primaries, off-year, and local elections tends to have even lower turnout. Historical trends show that the younger you are, the less likely you are to vote. Voters aged 18 to 29 routinely have the lowest turnout—under 50%—compared to all other age cohorts. Non-voters offer many explanations for not participating in elections, including that elections are rigged, that the two-party system doesn’t offer enough choices, that politicians don’t do what they promise, that the act of voting itself is confusing or difficult to access, and ultimately that their vote doesn’t matter. So why bother? Does your vote really matter?

==== Introducing the Guests
To help explore and answer this question, I’ve invited two of my governance studies colleagues to the show. First, Keshia Middlemass, a fellow and associate professor of American politics and public policy at Howard University. She’s the author of the award-winning book Convicted and Condemned: The Politics and Policies of Prisoner Reentry. Then, I’ll talk with senior fellow John Vant, director of the Brown Center on Education Policy. He specializes in pre-K through 12 education policy and politics, including inequities in U.S. schools.

==== Discussion with Keshia Middlemass: Does Your Vote Matter?
Keshia, welcome to Democracy in Question. Thank you so much for having me, Katie. It’s my pleasure. Let’s start off at the top: Does my vote really matter? Recent history says yes, your vote does matter. Within the United States, we have to think about federalism and the jurisdiction you live in. For instance, in the 2000 presidential election, 538 votes separated George W. Bush and Al Gore. Once the Supreme Court made its decision, George W. Bush was awarded the Electoral College votes for Florida, which allowed him to become president. In recent congressional elections, you can see house members winning by small margins. In 2022, Republican John James won Michigan’s 10th District by 1,600 votes, and Republican Zach Nunn in Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District won by just over 2,100 votes. You’re looking at fewer than 22,200 people determining the actual majority in the House of Representatives. I bet if you even went to local elections—like for mayors or city councils—you might find even smaller margins. Indeed, you will find in some elections they are differentiated by a few hundred votes. In school board elections and city council elections, those few hundred people, if you swing the vote a different way, actually have a different outcome.

==== Beyond Election Outcomes: Why Voting Matters
Apart from thinking that your vote will have a consequential influence on the outcome, there are lots of other reasons why you should vote too. Can you talk about those? Yes, besides the outcome of elections, elected officials make so many determinations about our lives. The media tends to focus on presidential elections and big-picture items like determining negotiations between Hamas and Israel or whether individuals will have their student loans forgiven—which the Supreme Court has just overturned. There are big national issues that tend to be eligible only for the president to address, but our lives are affected by who gets elected for mayor and city council. For instance, when we think about police budgets that go up year after year, it is the mayor and city council members who are deciding and signing the contracts for police. Those individuals can have a bigger impact on our daily lived experiences than a presidential election. I would also imagine that, ideally in a democracy like ours, you want people to feel like their vote matters—like they are part of the system, included, and enfranchised. How could we go about improving or increasing that sense of belongingness? That is probably one of the toughest questions: How do you belong to a society or community in which you live, where your family is? Part of it, of course, is through your vote. When you mention John coming on later and doing civic engagement, civic engagement is about what you care about—what issues you really care about. Let’s say someone is really interested in climate change and the impact the environment is having on our lived experiences. What can that young person, their family, or something they could do via their social interactions—be it at church or through any organization they’re affiliated with—do to clean up a river or a park in their local community? That could have a positive impact. By the sheer act of participating, you can improve your own surroundings and your own life going forward into the future.







==== Why Young Voters Don’t Turn Out
Why is it the case that when you look at data about who votes and who doesn’t vote longitudinally, the numbers and graph lines are very predictable? Basically, the younger you are, the less likely you turn out, and with each increasing cohort of age, voter participation goes up. Can we talk a little bit about young voters? Yes, of course. Young voters tend not to vote for multiple reasons. If you think about a young voter who leaves their family home and goes away to college, there’s an election, and they’ve got a different address—they have to re-register. Registration is a hurdle. Then, if you graduate and go to graduate school or move for another job, you now have a new address and have to re-register again. The registration process can really alienate individuals. There are also efforts to suppress college voters because they tend to be more left-leaning and liberal and vote Democrat when they do vote. Suppression efforts tighten IDs—photo IDs—so college students aren’t able to use a college ID, which has their current location, versus their driver’s license, which may be from another state, to register to vote. That’s one challenge individuals have. If you’re gone for three or four years, you should change your state driver’s license, but a lot of students don’t. They may never have any intention to move permanently to Indiana or Texas or wherever they’re going to college. Are there other reasons they don’t vote? Do they also have low levels of political efficacy where they feel like their vote doesn’t matter? Yes, this whole idea of a vote not mattering—unfortunately, the barrage of misinformation and disinformation since before 2020 has really dampened their spirit. However, there is data that demonstrates that since 2008 and the election of Obama, younger voters are excited and will turn out, register, and vote when they’re excited about the candidates. That is a challenge we have in general in America. There are lots of Boomers who are still in elected office, and younger voters are sort of like, “This person’s been there for 30 years; maybe it’s time for new blood.” Then the electoral system, for multiple reasons, allows individuals to get reelected over and over again. Part of this is just general excitement. Second is also this idea of who I am voting for and what they can do for me. Young people in that age bracket of 18 to 29 care about housing, getting a job, health care costs, reproductive freedom, and the environment. When a political party can address their issues directly, they feel more inclined to vote. It’s that combination of who the candidate is and what that candidate is communicating to them that they care about.

==== Barriers to Voting and Possible Solutions
Thinking about these younger voters, you mentioned that it’s difficult to register and there are barriers to entry. It seems to me that some of those are easy fixes. For instance, if your child goes to school in North Carolina, both campaigns could go down to the campuses and have young voters walk around with clipboards and register students to vote. In theory, registration to vote is to ensure that you are eligible to vote, but registration practices in the United States are also a restrictive measure. Some jurisdictions have same-day registration; some, like Oregon, have complete mail-in ballots where you don’t even have to go to the polls. Other states have the ability to do early voting so that there’s time before the actual election day in November to cast a ballot. You don’t have to be rushed, worry about missing work, or picking up a child after school. They have some flexibility. But those efforts are also hampered by individuals who don’t want to expand the electorate. In the best-case scenario, there would be same-day registration, you could use a picture ID issued by the government, and then you could cast a ballot. Unfortunately, because of federalism and states having the ability to set different rules for registration within their own state, we have multiple rules for different jurisdictions, and that’s where the confusion comes in. I have heard a lot of interesting ideas about turning Election Day into a holiday, which would be great—it might turn into three-day weekends for people—but it’s unclear. It’s interesting to point out and highlight those barriers. When you’re older, you find time to register and do all those things, but even early voting is such a huge convenience in the sense that you can avoid the long lines on Election Day. I’m sure that turnout rates are much higher in those states. Yes, and it’s not just the long lines. Long lines are an actual product of bad maintenance of election equipment that is only pulled out every two years. Long lines are also part of election administration, where jurisdictions aren’t investing in new equipment or fixing the equipment they do have. It’s understandable because it only happens every two or four years, and there are other more pressing needs. But you also have to think about this idea of what it means to vote and why the United States isn’t making it easier. Studies have shown there are generational or age cohorts. We’ve been talking about 18 to 29, which would be Gen Z, if I’m getting my generations correct. They are the more liberal generation—more liberal than Millennials, who are more liberal than Gen X, who are more liberal than Boomers. As each generation comes of age to vote, they will likely be more liberal, which scares people who are not left-leaning Democratic voters. Whoever controls the machinery of voting—the registration process, early voting, same-day registration, mail-in ballots—those individuals are then able to determine who is eligible and able to vote. They can try to tinker at the margins on what turnout will look like.

==== Close Elections and the Electoral College
Talking about tinkering at the margins, Biden won several states in 2020 because he was able to win Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Wisconsin by approximately 1% or less—about 10,000 votes total. Studies have shown that if 143,000 voters in those three states changed their votes, Trump would have been president in 2020. In 2016, less than 50,000 votes, if they had changed across three or four states, would have made Hillary Rodham Clinton president. Back to the original question: Does your vote matter? A lot of elections are won by very small margins. The interesting thing about U.S. elections, though, is that while there are close margins among states, in reality, it’s maybe seven out of 50 states—maybe 10 out of 50 states—that are what we call swing states, where the outcome will determine who wins the Electoral College. I could see young people saying, “This is an absurd system; why don’t we have a national vote?” But we do have the Electoral College. We have a Constitution that’s really difficult to amend. That’s unlikely to happen. It seems to me that you mentioned earlier the importance of having a younger candidate—at least not a Boomer, but younger than a Boomer—that they can relate to better, and then having issues that they really care about. The combination of a younger candidate and the issues strikes me as something that would probably drive up turnout within that cohort. Is that accurate? I think so, yes. When we think about 2008 and President Obama—pre-President Obama, Senator Obama—running for the presidency in 2008, he brought a type of energy to the electorate that people hadn’t seen before, not just because he was the first Black man to become the nominee of the Democratic Party, but because he was able to talk a language and speak about policies in a way younger people understood. The same happened, of course, when he was reelected in 2012. When we start thinking about younger candidates, I think about Hakeem Jeffries, who is the minority leader in the United States House of Representatives for the Democratic Party. He was able to capture the imagination of younger people. He is able to speak their language and cares about their issues, but he’s also going to platforms where young people are. He’s tweeting, he posts on Facebook—I know Facebook’s not for young people—but his staff will post things on Instagram. Part of it is not just using traditional media but meeting people where they are to educate them about what is going on. These candidates who are running for office need to work at it if they want to get the youth vote out. They need to find ways to connect with them. Elected officials could help by changing the registration laws.

==== Registration as a Key Barrier
Do you think that’s the biggest barrier? Among the many reasons they don’t vote, is that, to you, the most influential? It is one that I have seen. Being at Howard University, a lot of students are coming from outside the DMV area—from other states. They try to register in their home state and get an absentee ballot. Sometimes the absentee ballot arrives late. I know from studies done by political scientists that absentee ballots aren’t always counted. Then, back to the moving—when young people move, every time you move to a new address, or when women get married and change their name, they have to get a new ID and re-register. Sometimes it seems like registering should be easy, and it’s easy when you live at the same address and your name doesn’t change, but there are ways to make it more complicated—self-inflicted, so to speak. For me, registration is the first hurdle that should be addressed to increase voter turnout. You would need to lobby state by state in order to achieve that goal, unfortunately.

==== Youth Turnout and the Health of Democracy
A lot of times, people think that when voting participation is down—especially if it’s down in a particular key cohort—that’s a bad sign or a bad indicator of the health of our democracy. When you think about lower turnout among the youth vote, do you think that’s a bad sign for our democracy? I usually ask all my guests this question: On a scale of 1 to 10, how worried are you about the future of American democracy? A little background on me: I’m an institutionalist. I believe in institutions and the power of institutions. I am nervous about potential current reactions to election outcomes, but I’m not worried about American democracy and the future of American democracy. I feel that institutions and the people in them will be able to continue to protect the ballot and the ability of Congress to do its job. Yes, there are moments in time where we may not like the decisions institutions make, but the fact is that the institutions and the people in them will be able to at least support the idea of democracy and allow American democracy to go forward into the future. We’ve definitely had some rocky spots in our history, but we can overcome. Where would you be on that scale of 1 to 10 in terms of how worried you are about the future? It sounds like you’re pretty low. I’m pretty low—let’s say a 4. There are some challenges, but I’m not overly concerned. Thank you so much for coming to the show and talking about this fascinating issue. I might want to talk to you after the election too because I am curious to see what happens in this election in terms of the youth vote and their participation rates. Thank you for having me, Katie. I’d love to come back.

==== Discussion with John Vant: Education and Voting
Now, John Vant, who, in addition to his leadership of the Brown Center, also studies the politics of education, examining issues related to public opinion, partisan politics, and the goals of public education. John, welcome to Democracy in Question. Glad to be here. We just heard from our guest and your colleague—our colleague—Keshia Middlemass. We talked about young voters and why they might not want to vote. Does my vote matter? Of course, your vote matters, but despite the easy answer to that question, I would think it’s hard to encourage younger voters to turn out. I think your background and scholarship tie nicely to this question. Could you talk a little bit about how education plays a role in these ideas and people’s mindset about whether their vote matters? Sure, it’s really a two-part question. First, why is it that young people vote at lower rates than others? There are a lot of reasons for that. We know from research that some of it has to do with habits. Voting is a habit you form over time, and young people just haven’t had as many opportunities to go and vote. Many young people who don’t vote now might vote more in the future. Some of it is about barriers—it’s just too hard to vote in this country. One of the big barriers when it comes to voting is registering to vote. Sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds haven’t registered to vote yet. We’ve seen some progress when you have pre-registration or same-day registration—measures that get students up and ready so they can just vote when they’re of age. Then, there are some motivational issues too. A lot of young people look at our politics and government and just don’t see themselves in it—they don’t see a place for themselves. That’s particularly true for certain groups of young voters. A lot of that, I think, is because our schools haven’t done their fair share in preparing students to be good citizens. This is the second part of that question: Schools have to prepare students not just to vote once—it’s not just the act of voting—but to contribute to a strong democracy and a cohesive society. That is really a primary function of our public education system, and it’s one that, over time, I would argue we’ve started to neglect.

==== Pre-Registration and Schools’ Role
You mentioned that 16- and 17-year-olds haven’t registered to vote, but I thought they couldn’t vote until they were 18. That’s right—they can’t vote until they’re 18, although there are exceptions to that. In my hometown, Takoma Park, Maryland, you can actually vote in municipal elections at age 16 or 17. But it is true that in federal elections, you have to be 18 years old to vote. Now, some states—in fact, many states—actually allow pre-registration so that you can register to vote before you turn 18. When you turn 18, it’s one less hurdle that confronts you before you actually vote. It’s kind of advanced registration to make it easier when you’re off at college or wherever you might be. That’s right, and schools have an important role to play when it comes to registering students because a lot of kids turn 18 when they’re in their senior year of high school. Most states either allow or require schools to provide some kind of voter registration materials to students as they’re turning 18 years old. Whether schools actually do it has been very uneven. Even in states that have relatively strong requirements to get students up and running so they can vote, we’ve seen that a lot of schools just don’t do it, or districts don’t prioritize it.

==== STEM vs. Civic Education
I’m wondering if you know better than I do, but it seems to me that the emphasis on STEM education—science, technology, engineering, and mathematics—has that come at the cost of marginalizing the education directed at civic education? That’s a great question. I wouldn’t put them as competing because I think a STEM education is really important, and in lots of ways, building civics education and building STEM education can be compatible. But it is the case that the goals we have seen collectively as a country for our education system have evolved over time. We’ve come to a point now where we have what I would argue is a very narrow-minded view of schools: that they prepare students to be productive workers, preparing students for career or college. We really have lost sight of what was a core function of schools as we saw them early on, which was to prepare students to be good citizens who are contributing members of society. If you’ll allow me just a second of history—I was just going to ask you to explain the historical arc of public education in America and if it started with this emphasis on becoming a good citizen. It did, yes. A lot of the early purpose of education was really assimilating citizens—new citizens to the country—and trying to bring in new communities and have this cohesive society here in the U.S. Over time, schools tend to take on the problems of the country and have generally tried to address those problems.

==== A Nation at Risk and Shifting Priorities
The pivot that is most defining for what our schools do now came in the early 1980s—in 1983. There was a report issued by the Reagan administration called A Nation at Risk. What it did was set off a lot of alarms that we were losing our economic competitiveness relative to other countries because we weren’t developing the academic skills we needed to develop and weren’t preparing students to enter the workforce with those skills. What was the evidence they brought to bear to show that? My memory of the early 1980s was not of an economic collapse or a huge trade imbalance—what was the catalyst for producing such a report? What was really extraordinary about the report was how little it was actually based on. It pointed to some test scores comparing U.S. students to students internationally, but really, it was the rhetorical flourish of the report. It spoke in very scary language, and I think even the authors didn’t expect it to have the impact that it had, but it did. It set in Americans’ minds this idea that we’re falling way far behind when it comes to preparing workers. It set us down this path where, for the next few decades—really until the modern day—the infrastructure we’ve built in education policy is all organized around creating academic standards in subjects that are important and relatively easy to measure, like math and English language arts. We build these standards and say, “Okay, students in third grade, this is what they have to know; when they move to fourth grade, this is what they have to know.” Then we’ve built testing around those standards. Students go into school, they’re tested on how well they master the standards, and schools might be rewarded or punished based on how well their students have mastered those standards. When you build an accountability system like that, focused on a couple of subjects, schools tend to redirect all their attention to those subjects. That’s what we’ve seen over the last few decades. Our public education system has really focused on numeracy and literacy, which are absolutely core functions of schools, and preparing students to be workers is absolutely a core function of schools. But what isn’t being measured and isn’t part of any of those accountability systems—the collective priorities we’ve set for schools—is preparing students for a democracy. That, I think, has changed a great deal in recent decades, where our education policy and practice really just hasn’t kept up.

==== Impact of Testing and Accountability
It’s kind of astonishing, but maybe it shouldn’t be surprising, that when you change the incentives at the national level or even at the local levels, it trickles down such that schools need to teach for the test. Resources are allocated according to their performance on those tests—their students’ performance. That will shape the behavior in terms of the curriculum, and subjects that are less rewarded, like arts or things having to do with civics and maybe history, find their way lower and lower on the priority list. What’s interesting to me too is that this one report issued in the early ‘80s wasn’t challenged later. I know the next president was President Bush, also a Republican, but you would have thought that the Clinton administration and the relatively newly established Department of Education, established in the Carter administration, might have wanted to change the script, so to speak, and have our public schools focus less on testing. I agree there should be some accountability, but there’s probably a middle road where you test students occasionally but don’t focus all aspects of the school itself on a test. I think that’s right, and that really is where we’ve been. The politics of education are a little bit different from politics in some other fields. We actually had a reasonably strong bipartisan coalition that drove a lot of those education reforms of the past few decades. One part of it is this test-based accountability we’re talking about. The other part is certain forms of school choice that let families pick the schools their kids attend, which for a long time was charter schools—publicly funded, kind of privately run schools that are still part of the public education system and governed by a lot of the rules that govern public schools.

==== School Choice and Vouchers
You’re talking about vouchers too? Vouchers are the very contemporary reincarnation of that, and that is a particularly important question for this moment. When we had this bipartisan coalition, you had conservatives who, for a long time, really liked school choice policy. They saw in it this opportunity to bring market reforms to education, where only the schools that are the most appealing and successful will thrive, and other schools will close. You’ll have parents as consumers making decisions. You had Democrats who had a very different vision for what schools should be. Some parts of the Democratic Party were open to the idea of school choice, but it was more focused on the inherent unfairness that if you have money to choose where you live or which private school your kid attends, you have some form of school choice, but for some families, they just can’t afford to make that choice. We had this compromise for a long time, which was that we would have some kind of school choice policy, but it would take the form of school choice within the public sector. You could pick from schools across your district, or it would be these charter schools—quasi-private. Now, what’s happened in the last few years is, as we’ve started to see more polarization in politics in general and in the politics of education in particular, Democrats got sick of the idea of charter schools and backed away from that. Republicans have moved toward these very large-scale private school voucher programs. This is really happening just in the last few years. What these programs do is offer essentially all families in the states that have passed these policies—about a dozen states—the opportunity to take public funds and use them to pay for private school tuition or certain approved educational expenses. There’s essentially no Democratic support for that idea, and actually, there’s some opposition among Republicans too. What that does, when we’re thinking about the impacts of that for democracy, is it essentially removes any opportunity for a government role to shape what students know and any ability for us to ensure that there’s some baseline of core skills, knowledge, and disposition that students have as we’re preparing them to be citizens. In these places that have moved in that direction, we are very much moving away from a model that takes seriously that schools are really the public institutions we have for instilling those skills that people will ultimately need to be contributing members of our society and democracy.

==== Characteristics of Voucher States
Are there similarities between these 12 states? Are they regionally similar, or how would you describe them? Could you characterize them politically? They lean Republican, although there are a couple of purple states. Arizona was the first state that really pushed all-in on this, and I think it’s the most fundamental change in the core foundation of how we govern and run schools, certainly in my lifetime. It’s happening very quickly. Some of these states are just now seeing what the implications are of turning education over to the private sector and starting to back away from public education systems. A whole lot more states are about to find out what the effects of that move are before even these initial early adopters get to a point where they can show anything. It’s happening so quickly and without any real evidence to guide what’s going on. The very early evidence we have suggests a whole lot of problems. For example, some of my colleagues and I have been looking at who benefits from these programs. It’s by and large wealthy families that are getting these private school vouchers because often the voucher isn’t enough money to actually pay for private school tuition. If you’re a wealthy family, you’re taking this money from the state and might have to top that off and pay the rest of the tuition. But if you’re one of those low-income families who were, in theory at least, part of the motivation for some of these programs, they might not be able to pay that difference. It’s not that it creates new opportunities—there’s a real risk that what’s going to happen with all of this is that we’ll have some very stratified school education systems in some states. Where we have that stratification, we are losing our grip on our ability to instill some of those skills and dispositions that we really need across the citizenry for democracy.

==== Outsourcing Education and Public Confidence
In a sense, are they outsourcing education at the state level by providing these opportunities? I think that’s definitely one way of thinking about it. In the context of our politics right now, what we’ve seen in the last few years is a real erosion in attitudes toward K-12 education and the confidence that people have in our public education system. That’s not unusual in the context of American institutions. If you look at polling over time, all American institutions are polling at lower levels of confidence. It’s particularly true for public schools, and particularly true among Republicans. I think a lot of that has roots in the COVID-19 shutdowns and the backlash that resulted from schools being closed for quite a long time. That backlash first became a push toward some of these culture war battles over critical race theory and transgender students’ rights that we’re still dealing with in schools. More recently, it has really become a push to poke at the foundations of our public education system—to potentially set up this structure outside of public education that is really hostile to the public education system that we’ve had for centuries.

==== Ideas for Improving Civic Education
Those are fascinating developments. I’m a pretty careful news reader and hadn’t come across those. Tell me, in your perfect world, what could public education at the state or local level be doing to make better citizens? What are some tangible, concrete ideas that you have? There’s a lot that schools can do, and some of it is just hard to measure, so it doesn’t fit with that infrastructure we’ve built up with policy. Just to give a few examples: Our media landscape has changed very quickly over the last few decades, and our efforts when it comes to media literacy have not kept up. Making sure that students understand what is real, what is fake, what is a good source of information, and what’s a bad source—and showing them that they can be tricked and duped—is one area of skill-building with direct implications for democracy. Another, a little more abstract but an area I work on and care about, is instilling in students what we would call intellectual humility. This is essentially the idea that we’re all wrong all the time, we’re all vulnerable, and that’s okay. We should embrace that—it’s part of being human. As a result, you want people to seek out competing perspectives and keep an open mind to the idea that I might have this wrong and need to find a new way of doing this. In school, maybe that’s debate—setting up debate where you’re taking a perspective you might not agree with on an issue and really thinking through, “If I were arguing from this side, what would I say?”—keeping an open mind and being able to assess arguments and evidence. In addition to that—it’s a long list—but one more to highlight is that schools have a real role to play in instilling an understanding and belief in our core democratic norms and institutions. That’s really where Americans go to learn about our government and democracy. Some of that is about facts—teaching the structure of the U.S. federal government—but a lot of it is ensuring that people understand why we have the system we have and why it matters that we preserve it.

==== Current Civics Education and Socialization
Currently, at what age do they have a civics class or start to learn about the Constitution and those kinds of topics? It varies quite a bit from place to place because education is locally governed, and different states, districts, and schools will do things in different ways. Basically, what you see is that elementary schools will take baby steps toward teaching some of that, then it ramps up in middle school. By high school, you’ll see formal civics classes and government classes where students are really learning about the three branches of government—what we might remember as government class. Just as important as that, in my view, is that early building of that foundation in elementary school and middle school. For another example, giving students experiences in these baby mini-democratic systems—so in schools, you might have school government, student council, whatever it is—you’re letting students live in a safe little democracy in which they have a voice. They’re trying to understand how this works and how to feel it out, and they get to vote. They see themselves in it, they see how it matters, and that can start as early as early elementary school. I would imagine that, in addition to education itself, socialization at home plays a big role in terms of citizenship. For sure—socialization at home and socialization at school, which actually is another one of those things that has become very difficult in recent years, in large part because of cell phones. One of these issues that is very much of the moment and is not likely to go away anytime soon is that it’s gotten harder for students to socialize in school when they look around and all their classmates are on their phones. That’s true in school, it’s true out of school, but the landscape for that kind of socialization has changed. Yes, some of it happens at home—from interaction between parents and kids and kids and siblings—but really, that is one of the core purposes of schools: developing those social-emotional skills and creating in kids this ability to make friends, understand how to navigate disagreements and conflicts, and all of that. That is absolutely a core function of schooling too. I imagine you’re a supporter of the phone bans that are occurring in some schools lately? I am, yes.

==== John Vant’s View on Democracy’s Future
A lot of people tie this low voter participation to, or use it as an indicator for, how healthy our democracy is. I’d like to ask my guests at the end of the episode how they feel about American democracy and its future. On a scale of 1 to 10, how nervous are you about the future of American democracy? In your case, I would highlight this recent development of, in a sense, outsourcing or privatizing education to some extent—does that in and of itself make you a little wary about the future of democracy? I am worried about it. When I think about democracy, I think about it in the very long term. There are certainly a lot of things we can do right now to solve some very immediate problems. To my eye, the ultimate functioning of our democracy is—the primary input in that is all of us. What are our values, what do we know, what do we care about, and how do we interact with one another and see one another? When I think about the future of democracy, I think about people—us—and how we are training people to navigate those systems. I am very worried about that. A lot of that has to do with how quickly the world has changed around us. The way students are interacting with other people, the way they’re getting information about the world, the way they are learning about people who disagree with them—all of that has changed radically over the last few decades. I would argue that in that time, when we were really worried about preparing students for this 21st-century economy where we had to be globally competitive with workforce issues, we missed the big point: Our 21st-century democracy looks very different from our 20th-century democracy. Getting people ready to navigate that democracy requires some actual teaching. I worry that we still haven’t learned that lesson, and we haven’t learned it at a time when change is only speeding up. I worry too that we adults who are in the system—deep somewhere in our cold, polarized hearts—have an understanding of what America is and what our institutions are. We have a sense of the way things were and maybe should be with respect to government and institutions. I worry that young people are growing up in a different environment where they’re hearing different things about those institutions. When we look over the long run—whether it’s that technology is changing faster than our educational practice and policy, whether it’s that our norms are changing and we’re going to feel that with future generations more than with our current generations, or whether we have these really serious attacks on our public education systems—I am concerned over the long run. Where would you be on that scale from 1 to 10? I will put myself at an 8.5—using a fraction! It’s been a pleasure to talk to you. I’ve learned so much today, and now I know what to read about when I focus on education articles, in terms of those efforts in those 12 states. That’s really fascinating. My pleasure—thank you for your time. Thanks for having me.
