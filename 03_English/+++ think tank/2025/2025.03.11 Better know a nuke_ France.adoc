==== Introduction to the Program

Welcome to ACP. I'm your host, Alex Bues, the head of Strategy 战略, Technology, and Arms Control 军备控制 at the International Institute for Strategic Studies 国际战略研究所 in Berlin. On each episode 节目, we welcome the world's leading experts 专家 in arms control 军备控制 to share (v.) their knowledge and assessments 评估 of the most critical 关键的 issues 问题. Whether you're new to the topic 话题 or need a refresher 复习;可提神的人或物；补习课程；清凉饮料, I hope you will join us *in our exploration 探索 of* everything *related to* arms control 军备控制. In this season 季, we offer primers 入门指南;初级读本；入门书 on all the nuclear weapons arsenals 军火库 currently existing in the world and their relationship to arms control. I hope it helps you better understand a nuke 核弹 (short for nuclear weapon).

中文翻译:

欢迎来到ACP。我是你的主持人亚历克斯·布斯，担任"柏林国际战略研究所"的战略、技术和军备控制负责人。在每一期节目中，我们都会邀请世界领先的军备控制专家, 分享他们的知识, 和对最关键问题的评估。无论你是这个话题的新手还是需要复习，我希望你能加入我们，一起探索与军备控制相关的一切。在这一季中，我们提供了世界上现存所有核武器军火库, 及其与军备控制关系的入门指南。我希望这能帮助你更好地理解核弹。

==== Overview of France’s Nuclear Policy

It was obvious early on that *France did not have the means* 手段 to develop (v.) an arsenal 军火库 that could *be based on* _counterforce 反制力量 strategies_ 战略 or follow (v.) the trends 趋势 of the Soviet Union or the U.S. But with the strategy  you can afford... Today, we turn to France, a country that has long insisted on the independence  of its deterrent 威慑力量;威慑，遏制；威慑武器. What drives (v.) its nuclear policy  and its reluctance 犹豫；不情愿 to engage in 参与 arms control ? What role does it play (v.) in European security, and would it be possible to expand  that role ? To help us better understand this, we're joined by leading experts 专家 on _French nuclear strategy_ .

中文翻译:

很早就明显看出，法国没有手段发展一个基于反制力量战略的军火库，也无法跟随苏联或美国的趋势。但有了你负担得起的战略……今天，我们将目光转向法国，一个长期坚持其"威慑力量独立性"的国家。是什么驱动了它的核政策, 及其对参与军备控制的犹豫？它在欧洲安全中扮演什么角色，是否有可能扩展这一角色？为了帮助我们更好地理解这一点，我们邀请了法国核战略的领先专家。

==== Historical Development of French Nuclear Weapons

Our first guest is Éloïse Fette, the research fellow 研究人员;（学术或专业团体）会员 and head of _the Deterrence 威慑 and Proliferation 扩散;（数量的）激增，剧增 Program_ at _the French Institute of International Relations_ 法国国际关系研究所. 'Seeing the use of a nuclear weapon in Japan, seeing their development by the U.S. and by the USSR 苏联, the French government _at the time_ understood (v.) that we needed a French nuclear weapon  in order to gain status 地位, in order to assure our own defense — _French-owned deterrence_ 法国自有的威慑力量. The bureau 局 to create the first French nuclear weapon was created in 1954. There was a lot of money dedicated 专用的 to the program, and when Charles de Gaulle *came back to power* 重新上台掌权 in 1958 and became the French president within the Fifth Republic 第五共和国, he gave the final push 推动 to really get a French nuclear weapon to work (v.) and to be used (v.)  within the deterrent 威慑力量 and defense strategic posture 战略态势 of France. The first French _nuclear test_ 核试验 was in February 1960.

中文翻译:

我们的第一位嘉宾, 是埃卢瓦兹·费特，她是"法国国际关系研究所"威慑与扩散计划的研究人员和负责人。‘看到日本使用核武器，看到美国和苏联发展核武器，**当时的法国政府明白, 我们需要法国自己的核武器，以获得地位，确保我们自己的防御——法国自有的威慑力量。**创建第一个法国核武器的局, 成立于1954年。这个计划投入了大量专用资金，当戴高乐在1958年重新掌权, 并成为第五共和国的法国总统时，他给予了最终推动，使法国核武器真正运作, 并用于法国的威慑力量和防御战略态势中。第一次法国核试验是在1960年2月。’

Emmanuel Metra, a senior nuclear weapons 核武器 researcher 研究人员 at the Foundation for Strategic Research 战略研究基金 in Paris, continues with the motivation 动机 behind the French nuclear program 法国核计划. 'The idea from Charles de Gaulle was that you cannot rely on 依靠 an ally 盟友 for your own security 安全 when a nuclear war 核战争 is at stake 处于危险中, and that only a national deterrence 国家威慑力量 can be really credible 可信的. At the time, it was probably influenced 影响 by events 事件 that the leaders had experienced. They had been deeply marked 深深地标记 by the invasion 入侵 twice of French territory 法国领土—the defeats 失败 in 1940 and the Nazi invasion 纳粹入侵 had really marked them. Other elements 因素 probably also had influence 影响. After the Second World War, France was involved in 卷入 colonial wars 殖民战争 and realized  that it could not rely on 依靠 the support 支持 of its allies 盟友 for these situations 情况, in Indochina 印度支那 in particular 尤其, where the United States was not willing to commit 承诺 very deeply 深入地. The Suez affair 苏伊士事件 in 1956, which is often mentioned 提及, also triggered 引发 this idea that France and Britain could not rely on 依靠 the U.S. being always there to support 支持 their policy decisions 政策决定. These elements 因素 contributed to 创建 this obsession 痴迷 with being sovereign 主权的, being independent 独立的 in developing 发展 a nuclear deterrent 核威慑力量.

中文翻译:

"巴黎战略研究基金"的资深核武器研究人员埃马纽埃尔·梅特拉, 继续讲述法国核计划背后的动机。‘**戴高乐的想法是，当核战争处于危险中时，你不能依靠盟友来保障自己的安全，只有国家威慑力量才是真正可信的。**当时，这可能是受到领导人经历的事件的影响。他们被法国领土曾遭两次入侵——1940年的失败, 和纳粹入侵——深深地标记。其他因素可能也有影响。第二次世界大战后，**法国卷入了殖民战争，并意识到, 它不能依靠盟友的支持来应对这些情况，**尤其是在印度支那，美国不愿意深入承诺。*1956年的苏伊士事件经常被提及，也引发了法国和英国不能依靠美国始终支持其政策决定的想法。这些因素促成了对主权、独立发展核威慑力量的痴迷。(事后证明这种想法是正确的. 乌克兰就是前车之鉴.)*’

==== Evolution of the French Nuclear Arsenal
Éloïse Fette continues the story with changes 变化 to the French nuclear arsenal 法国核军火库 at the end of the Cold War 冷战. 'During the Cold War 冷战, we had this full triad 三位一体: a land component 陆地部分, airborne 空中的, and seaborne 海上的. At the end of the Cold War 冷战, because nuclear weapons 核武器 were not as important 重要的 as they were during the Cold War 冷战 and it was about peace dividends 和平红利, we had to reduce 减少 military expenses 军事开支. It was decided to drop 放弃 the ground component 地面部分, especially 尤其 because, in fact, they were partly made to target 针对 Germany in case of 万一 a Soviet invasion 苏联入侵. When Germany was reunified 统一, there were serious talks 严肃的会谈 between France and Germany, and Germany explained it might be nice for you to drop 放弃 the weapons 武器 that you could use to target 针对 our country. France complied 遵守. It was also because nuclear weapons 核武器 were not really in favor 受欢迎 anymore. It helped France to cut 削减 its arsenal 军火库 by half, from around 600 strategic nuclear warheads 战略核弹头 by the end of the Cold War 冷战 to around 300 strategic nuclear warheads 战略核弹头 today. Contrary to 与…相反 the U.S. or Russia, all the warheads 弹头 are deployed 部署; we don’t have warheads 弹头 in reserve 储备. They are spread 分散 between the four French SSBNs 核潜艇—nuclear submarines 核潜艇—and the two squadrons 中队, around maybe 40 Rafale jets 阵风战斗机 that can carry 携带 the nuclear airborne 空中核 cruise missile 巡航导弹 of the French Strategic Air Force 法国战略空军.

中文翻译:

埃卢瓦兹·费特继续讲述冷战末期法国核军火库的变化。‘**在冷战期间，我们拥有完整的核三位一体：陆地部分、空中的和海上的。冷战结束时，**因为核武器不像冷战期间那么重要，而且是为了和平红利，我们不得不减少军事开支。决定放弃地面部分，尤其是因为这些武器实际上部分是针对德国的，以防苏联入侵。当德国统一时，法国和德国进行了严肃的会谈，德国表示你们放弃那些可以针对我们国家的武器可能会更好。法国遵守了这一建议。这也是因为核武器不再受欢迎。这帮助**法国将其军火库削减了一半，从冷战末期大约600个战略核弹头减少到今天的大约300个战略核弹头。与美国或俄罗斯相反，所有的弹头都已部署；我们没有储备弹头。**它们分散在四艘法国核潜艇和两个中队之间，大约有40架可以携带法国战略空军空中"核巡航导弹"的阵风战斗机。’

It was obvious 明显的 early on that France did not have the means 手段 to develop 发展 an arsenal 军火库 that could be based on counterforce 反制力量 strategies 战略 or follow the trends 趋势 of the Soviet Union 苏联 or the U.S. But with the strategy 战略 you can afford 负担得起, it based it on the idea of strict sufficiency 严格充足, which means that the goal 目标 is to have enough 足够的 forces 力量 to create 创建 serious 严重的 damage 损害—damage 损害 that would be a deterrent 威慑力量 for any attack 攻击 from major adversaries 主要对手—but not to go beyond 超越 and not to look at 考虑 exactly all the targets 目标 you could actually consider 考虑 in the adversary 对手. This notion 概念, however, can evolve 演变. It is going to be built on 基于 a number of issues 问题, including 包括, for instance 例如, how well the adversary 对手 is defending 防御 itself and how many weapons 武器 would be judged 判断 necessary 必要的 to actually create 创建 that damage 损害. So, it can be reviewed 审查 by the president 总统.

中文翻译:

‘很早就明显看出，法国没有手段发展一个基于反制力量战略的军火库，也无法跟随苏联或美国的趋势。但有了你负担得起的战略，它基于严格充足的概念，这意味着**目标是拥有足够的力量来造成严重的损害**——这种损害将成为对任何来自主要对手的攻击的威慑力量——但不超越，也不精确考虑对手中你实际上可以考虑的所有目标。然而，这个概念可以演变。它将基于一些问题，例如对手防御得如何，以及判断需要多少武器来实际造成那种损害。因此，它可以由总统审查。’

==== French Nuclear Doctrine and Strategy
One of the specifics 特点 of the French nuclear doctrine 法国核原则 is this notion 概念 of a final warning 最后警告—or just a warning 警告. France does not have the means 手段, does not have the doctrine 原则, to respond 回应 to a nuclear strike 核打击 with a nuclear strike 核打击 and try to escalate 升级 at the reciprocal 相互的 level 水平. It does not intend 打算 to lead 领导 a nuclear war 核战争 or to do limited 有限的 strikes 打击—that is completely foreign 陌生的 to the French doctrine 法国原则. However, there’s the idea that threatening 威胁 to do nothing or to do a massive 大规模的 response 回应 could be a bit extreme 极端的 and could lack 缺乏 credibility 可信度, and that it could be useful 有用的 to have something in between 在…之间. That something in between 在…之间 is this notion 概念 of a warning 警告. The nuclear warning 核警告 can happen in any situation 情况; there’s no preset 预设的 scenario 场景 where it could happen. It doesn’t have to happen at all. We could imagine 想象 a massive 大规模的 retaliation 报复 without a warning 警告. At this stage 阶段, the president 总统 has this option 选择 of striking 打击 with this kind of limited 有限的 strike 打击, with the idea that maybe the adversary 对手 did not realize 意识到 that it was crossing 跨越 the threshold 门槛 of French vital interests 法国重大利益 and that this warning shot 警告射击 is going to be a way 方法 for the adversary 对手 to understand 理解 that it has to back down 退让. This warning 警告 is not going to be repeated 重复, and the next time 下一次 is going to be massive 大规模的 retaliation 报复.

中文翻译:

‘**法国核原则的一个特点是"最后警告"——或仅仅是"警告"——的概念。**法国没有手段，也没有原则，以核打击回应核打击并试图在相互的水平上升级。它不打算领导核战争, 或进行有限的打击——这对法国原则来说完全是陌生的。然而，有一种想法认为，威胁什么都不做, 或做出大规模回应, 可能有点极端，可能会缺乏可信度，有某种"中间的选择"可能是有用的。这个中间的选择就是"警告"的概念。**核警告可以在任何情况下发生；没有预设的场景规定它必须发生。它完全可以不发生。我们可以想象没有警告的大规模报复。**在这个阶段，总统有选择进行这种有限打击的选项，想法是也许对手没有意识到它跨越了法国重大利益的门槛，而这个警告发射, 将是让对手理解它必须退让的一种方法。*这个警告不会重复，下一次将是大规模报复。*’

The notion 概念 of vital interests 重大利益 is really key 关键的 and core 核心的 and is repeated 重复 extensively 广泛地—this idea that only the president 总统 can determine 决定 what a vital interest 重大利益 is or not. So, it’s really a personal responsibility 个人责任 to assess 评估 if the damage 损害 that the country 国家 has received 接收 or if the level 水平 of the attack 攻击 is sufficient 足够的 to lead to 导致 nuclear retaliation 核报复. This connection 联系 with the president 总统 of the Republic 共和国 is really emphasized 强调 in the deterrence 威慑力量. Something that goes with that 与之相关的 is that, while the doctrine 原则 itself is rather restrained 克制的 in many ways 多方面, France does not accept 接受 formal 正式的 restraints 限制 easily 容易地. The idea is really to keep options open 保持选择开放 for the president 总统. We will not, for instance 例如, declare 宣布 a no-first-use policy 不首先使用政策 or declare 宣布 that nuclear weapons 核武器 would only be used in response 回应 to nuclear aggression 核侵略. There are other elements 因素 like this where France is very reluctant 犹豫；不情愿 to commit 承诺 because the idea is that, really, the president 总统 is going to judge 判断 if the situation 情况 falls within 属于 the field 领域 of nuclear deterrence 核威慑力量 or not. So, there is a kind of reluctance 犹豫；不情愿 to commit 承诺 in the current context 背景下 to anything that could limit 限制 its freedom of action 行动自由.

中文翻译:

‘**"重大利益"的概念真的是关键和核心的，**并且被广泛重复——这个想法是**只有总统才能决定什么是"重大利益"。**因此，这真的是评估国家受到的损害或攻击的水平是否足以导致"核报复"的个人责任。与共和国总统的这种联系, 在威慑力量中被真正强调。与之相关的是，尽管原则本身在多方面是相当克制的，法国并不容易接受正式的限制。想法真的是**为总统保持"开放式选择"。**例如，**我们不会宣布"不首先使用"政策，也不会宣布"核武器只会在回应核侵略时使用"。**有其他类似的因素，法国非常不愿意承诺，因为想法是，**由总统自己判断情况是否属于核威慑力量的领域。因此，**在当前背景下，有一种**不愿意承诺"任何可能限制其行动自由的事情"。**’

Within the French nuclear doctrine 法国核原则, there is this refusal 拒绝 of the idea of nuclear escalation 核升级 and nuclear warfighting 核战争作战. That’s why we don’t have tactical 战术的 nuclear weapons 核武器, contrary to 与…相反, for example 例如, the U.S., which has this idea of nuclear warfighting 核战争作战 and the notion 概念 that a nuclear war 核战争 could be fought 作战. It’s not present 存在 in the French nuclear doctrine 法国核原则 because a nuclear war 核战争 on the European continent 欧洲大陆 would be a nuclear war 核战争 for everyone 每个人, and it won’t be limited 有限的. In fact, the current damage 损害 that can be done by nuclear warheads 核弹头, even with a low yield 低当量, would be damaging 损害的 for the whole country 整个国家 that is attacked 被攻击的. The integration 整合 between European countries 欧洲国家 is so huge 巨大的, and the small scale 小规模 of the European continent 欧洲大陆 would make this limited 有限的 nuclear war 核战争 not limited 有限的 at all for European countries 欧洲国家.

中文翻译:

在法国"核原则"中，有对"核升级"和"核战争作战"想法的拒绝。这就是为什么我们没有"战术核武器"，与例如美国相反，美国有"核战争作战"的想法, 和"核战争可以作战"的概念。这在法国"核原则"中不存在，因为**欧洲大陆上的核战争,** 对每个人来说都是核战争，而且__不会是"有限"的。__事实上，**即使是低当量的核弹头所能造成的当前损害，对被攻击的国家来说也会造成整体性损害。**欧洲国家之间的整合是如此巨大，*欧洲大陆的小规模(即欧洲国家都面积太小, 即使是小型核武器, 都可能造成灭国之灾), 将使这种"有限的核战争"对欧洲国家来说完全"不有限"。*

==== Components of the French Nuclear Deterrent
The airborne 空中的 component 组成部分 of the French nuclear deterrent 法国核威慑力量 is, in fact, divided 分成 in two. So, we have the Strategic Air Force 战略空军, and we also have something else that is very unique 独特的 to France. The U.S. used to have this by the end of the Cold War 冷战—it’s the naval nuclear air force 海空核力量, the Force Aéronavale Nucléaire (FANu). So, from the French Navy Air Force 法国海军空军, they are able to land 降落 and take off 起飞 from the French aircraft carrier 法国航空母舰 with nuclear weapons 核武器. Basically 基本上, the French aircraft carrier 法国航空母舰 is equipped 装备 to host 承载 nuclear weapons 核武器 if needed 如果需要—nuclear cruise missiles 核巡航导弹, if needed 如果需要—and you have a part 部分 of the naval air force fleet 海军空军舰队 that can carry 携带 nuclear weapons 核武器. It’s unique 独特的 among nuclear weapon states 核武器国家. It gives additional 额外的 flexibility 灵活性 to the French president 法国总统. It’s also very useful 有用的 for strategic signaling 战略信号 because if you have both the aircraft carrier 航空母舰 and the Rafale Marine planes 海军阵风飞机, and it is known 已知 that nuclear weapons 核武器 are on board 在船上, and you sail 航行 near China or maybe in the Northern Atlantic 北大西洋, it gives a very strong 强烈的 signal 信号 that nuclear weapons 核武器 could be used by the French president 法国总统 if the vital interests 重大利益 of France are being threatened 威胁 by another nuclear weapon state 核武器国家.

中文翻译:

法国核威慑力量的空中组成部分, 实际上分成两部分。所以，我们有战略空军，还有一些对法国来说非常独特的东西。美国在冷战结束时曾经有过这个——它是海空核力量，海军核航空部队（FANu）。所以，从法国海军空军，他们能够从法国航空母舰上降落和起飞，携带核武器。基本上，法国航空母舰装备了承载核武器的能力，如果需要的话——核巡航导弹，如果需要的话——你有一部分的海军空军舰队可以携带核武器。这在核武器国家中是独特的。它为法国总统提供了额外的灵活性。它对于战略信号也非常有用，因为如果你有航空母舰和海军阵风飞机，并且已知船上有核武器，你在中国附近或北大西洋航行，这给出了一个非常强烈的信号，即如果法国的重大利益受到另一个核武器国家的威胁，法国总统可能会使用核武器。

So, it’s really short 简短的, meaning 意思 that we don’t have, like the U.S., for example 例如, a nuclear posture review 核态势评估 where we lay out 列出 precisely 精确地 what French nuclear policy 法国核政策 is. It’s only, in fact, a speech 演讲—meaning 意思 that each president 总统 gives, usually 通常 two or three years after their entry to power 上台, a speech 演讲 on the defense policy 国防政策 of France. Within this speech 演讲, they can include 包括 slight 轻微的 changes 变化 to the French nuclear doctrine 法国核原则 based on 基于 their own understanding 理解 of the doctrine 原则 but also maybe their past experiences 过去经验 with nuclear weapons 核武器.

中文翻译:

所以，它真的很简短，意思是我们不像美国那样，例如，有一个核态势评估，精确地列出法国"核政策"是什么。实际上，它只是一次演讲——意思是**每个总统在上台后, 通常两三年内会发表一次关于法国"国防政策"的演讲。**在这次演讲中，他们可以包括对法国核原则的轻微变化，基于他们对原则的理解，也可能是他们与核武器的过去经验。

==== Continuity and Modernization of French Nuclear Doctrine
Since the end of the Cold War 冷战, the French nuclear doctrine 法国核原则 has pretty much 几乎 stayed the same 保持不变: strictly 严格地 defensive 防御性的, made to deter 威慑 any attack 攻击 against vital interests 重大利益. There are no lists 清单 of vital interests 重大利益 because if you say precisely 精确地 to your adversary 对手, "Okay, I will answer 回应 with nuclear weapons 核武器 only if you hit 打击 this and this, but if you hit 打击 something else 其他东西 I won’t answer 回应," it limits 限制 flexibility 灵活性. Usually 通常, we understand 理解 vital interests 重大利益 as the integrity 完整性 of the French state 法国国家, its ability 能力 to still function 运作 as a state 国家—also the integrity 完整性 not of the whole territory 整个领土, but at least 至少 not losing 失去 a whole region 整个地区 of France, like we did in the 19th century 19世纪 because of the war 战争 with the German Empire 德意志帝国. It’s pretty broad 广泛的 and pretty narrow 狭窄的 at the same time 同时. It’s fully up to 完全取决于 the French president 法国总统 to decide 决定 whether to use 使用 nuclear weapons 核武器, and that’s why the French president 法国总统 is directly elected 直接选举—meaning 意思 that French citizens 法国公民 directly 直接地 vote 投票 for who they want to be the president 总统.

中文翻译:

自冷战结束以来，*法国"核原则"几乎保持不变：严格防御性的，旨在威慑任何对"重大利益"的攻击。而且##也不存在"重大利益的清单"，因为如果你精确地对你的对手说，‘好吧，我只会在你打击这个和那个时, 才用核武器回应，但如果你打击其他东西, 我就不会回应，’这会限制灵活性。##通常，我们理解"重大利益"是指"法国国家的完整性"，它作为一个国家"能继续运作"的能力*——也不是整个领土的完整性，但至少不失去法国的整个地区，就像我们在19世纪因为与德意志帝国的战争那样。它同时既广泛又狭窄。*是否使用核武器完全取决于法国总统决定，这就是为什么法国总统是直接选举的*——意思是法国公民直接投票选择他们想要谁做总统。

French presidents 法国总统, on the first day 第一天 of their mandate 任期, are taken into 被带入 the bunker 地堡 from where they can see 看到 the whole situation 整个情况 regarding French nuclear weapons 法国核武器, and they are immediately 立即 given 给予 the codes 密码 and the processes 过程 to launch 发射 a nuclear weapon 核武器. So, the position 地位 of the French president 法国总统 is, in fact, very deeply 深深地 linked to 联系到 French nuclear deterrence 法国核威慑力量. It takes time 需要时间 to write 写 a speech 演讲 on nuclear weapons 核武器—on nuclear deterrence 核威慑力量—because it’s such a sensitive 敏感的 topic 话题 and really based on 基于 words 词语. In fact, because, of course, the objective 目标 of nuclear weapons 核武器 is not to use 使用 a nuclear weapon 核武器, you have to produce 产生 what we call strategic signaling 战略信号 in order to demonstrate 展示 your potential 潜在的 willingness 意愿 to use 使用 nuclear weapons 核武器 if needed 如果需要. It can go through 通过 exercises 演习, and it can go through 通过 speeches 演讲. So, it takes a lot of time 需要很多时间 to write 写 one. For example 例如, President Macron came to power 上台 in May 2017, and he made his speech 发表演讲 in February 2020. It takes a lot of time 需要很多时间, and many people asked about it—experts 专家, but also officials 官员 and diplomats 外交官.

中文翻译:

**法国总统在他们任期的第一天, 就会被带入地堡，从那里他们可以看到关于法国核武器的整个情况，他们立即被给予发射核武器的密码和流程。**所以，法国总统的地位, 实际上与法国核威慑力量深深联系在一起。写一篇关于核武器——核威慑力量的演讲需要时间，因为这是一个如此敏感的话题，并且真的基于词语。事实上，因为当然核武器的目标不是使用核武器，你必须产生我们所谓的战略信号，以展示你潜在的意愿，如果需要的话使用核武器。这可以通过演习，也可以通过演讲。所以，写一篇需要很多时间。例如，马克龙总统在2017年5月上台，他在2020年2月发表了演讲。这需要很多时间，许多人对此提出疑问——专家，还有官员和外交官。

Two components 组成部分—one airborne 空中的, one seaborne 海上的—are currently 目前 undergoing 经历 modernization 现代化. There are always programs 计划 to update 更新 the warheads 弹头, both for the cruise missiles 巡航导弹 and also for the submarine-launched ballistic missiles 潜射弹道导弹. The missiles 导弹 themselves are being updated 更新 with new standards 标准. So, the M51.3 standard 标准 of the SLBM missile 潜射弹道导弹 was tested 测试, I think, last year 去年. We are expecting 期待 the standard 标准 M51.4 maybe in the next year 明年 or quite soon 很快. And the ASMPA, the current 当前的 cruise missile 巡航导弹 for the Strategic Air Force 战略空军, is going to be replaced 替换 maybe in ten years 十年—less than ten years 不到十年, during the 2030s 2030年代—with the ASN4G, which will be hypersonic 超音速的. For the moment 目前, the cruise missile 巡航导弹 is supersonic 超音速的, and the next one 下一种 will be hypersonic 超音速的 in order to have further 进一步的 maneuverability 机动性 while keeping 保持 high supersonic speed 高超音速.

中文翻译:

两个组成部分——一个空中的，一个海上的——目前正在经历"现代化"。总是有计划更新弹头，包括巡航导弹, 和潜射弹道导弹。导弹本身正在用新标准更新。所以，M51.3标准的潜射弹道导弹，我想，是去年测试的。我们期待M51.4标准可能在明年或很快到来。而ASMPA，当前战略空军的巡航导弹，将在十年内——不到十年，在2030年代——被ASN4G替换，它将是超音速的。目前，巡航导弹是超音速的，下一种将是超音速的，以便在保持高超音速的同时具有进一步的机动性。

The third generation 第三代 of SSBNs 核潜艇 should be put to sea 出海 again in around ten years 大约十年. About the Rafale 阵风战斗机, it’s a bit more complicated 复杂的 because we’re supposed to 应该 build 建造 the Future Combat Air System 未来作战航空系统 with some European countries 欧洲国家, but it doesn’t go as quickly 进展不快 as we would like 希望. We might just need to continue 继续 updating 更新 the current 当前的 fighter 战斗机 of the Air Force 空军 so it’s still able to conduct 进行 the nuclear raid 核袭击. The two components 组成部分 are being modernized 现代化—both the carriers 载体 and the weapons 武器. That’s why we see a slight 轻微的 increase 增加 in the budget 预算 of the French armed forces 法国武装部队 dedicated to 专用于 nuclear weapons 核武器, because, of course, modernization 现代化 is quite expensive 昂贵的.

中文翻译:

第三代核潜艇应该在大约十年后再次出海。关于阵风战斗机，情况有点复杂，因为我们应该与一些欧洲国家建造未来作战航空系统，但进展不如我们希望的快。我们可能只需要继续更新当前空军的战斗机，以便它仍然能够进行核袭击。两个组成部分正在"现代化"——载体和武器。这就是为什么我们看到法国武装部队专用于核武器的预算略有增加，因为当然，现代化是相当昂贵的。

We don’t have any plans 计划 to increase 增加 the number 数量 of warheads 弹头, first because all the installations 设施 to produce 生产 fissile plutonium 可裂变钚 were dismantled 拆除 by the beginning 开始 of this century 本世纪. It would be more difficult 更困难 to produce 生产 fissile material 可裂变材料 to build 建造 new warheads 新弹头. All the plutonium 钚 used in French nuclear warheads 法国核弹头 is recycled 回收—when the warhead 弹头 is too old 太旧, the fissile materials 可裂变材料 are removed 移除 and recycled 回收 in order to make 制造 new solid 固体 warheads 弹头. Also, all the testing facilities 测试设施 were dismantled 拆除 30 years ago 30年前. Contrary to 与…相反, for example 例如, Russia or the United States, France is not able to do 进行 nuclear tests 核试验 again. We are a full 完全的 signatory 签署国 of the CTBT 全面禁止核试验条约, the treaty 条约 against nuclear testing 核试验, meaning 意思 that we rely on 依靠 only simulation programs 模拟计划—mathematical 数学的, physical 物理的, chemical 化学的 simulation programs 模拟计划—to continue 继续 updating 更新 the French nuclear warheads 法国核弹头.

中文翻译:

*我们没有任何计划增加弹头的数量，首先因为所有生产"可裂变钚"的设施, 在本世纪初已被拆除。生产可裂变材料来建造新弹头会更困难。法国核弹头中使用的所有钚, 都是回收的——当弹头太旧时，可裂变材料被移除, 并回收，以便制造新的固体弹头。此外，所有测试设施在30年前都被拆除。与俄罗斯或美国相反，法国无法再次进行"核试验"。我们是"全面禁止核试验条约"的完全签署国，这个条约反对"核试验"，意思是我们只依靠模拟计划——数学的、物理的、化学的模拟计划——来继续更新法国核弹头。*

==== French Nuclear Deterrence and European Security
The French contribution 贡献 to the defense 防御 of Europe is a very old 古老的 one. One of the first white papers 白皮书 about defense 防御 in France, in 1972—so it is considered 被认为 the first strategic 战略的 document 文件 on nuclear weapons 核武器 and nuclear doctrine 核原则 in France because we had the full triad 三位一体 by that time 那时候—states 声明 that French nuclear weapons 法国核武器 are made to defend 防御 French vital interests 法国重大利益, French territory 法国领土, but also French approaches 相似（或近似）的事物;方法. So, what does it mean 意味着什么? We don’t really know 知道, but it is interpreted 解释 as maybe the protection 保护 of France’s closest neighbors 最近的邻国 at the time 那时候—West Germany 西德, Belgium 比利时, Luxembourg 卢森堡, maybe Italy 意大利—against possible 可能的 threats 威胁 to their own vital interests 他们自己的重大利益.

中文翻译:

法国对欧洲防御的贡献, 历史是非常古老的。*1972年法国关于防御的第一份白皮书*——因为我们那时候拥有完整的"核三位一体"，所以**它被认为是法国关于核武器和"核原则"的第一个战略文件——声明法国核武器是为了防御法国的"重大利益"、法国领土，还有法国的相关利益。那么，这意味着什么？我们不太知道，**但它被解释为可能是对法国那时候最近邻国的保护——西德、比利时、卢森堡，也许还有意大利——对抗对其自身"重大利益"的可能威胁。

**French approaches 指的是法国周边的战略要地, 或接近法国本土的区域，**可能包括邻近的欧洲国家（如西德、比利时、卢森堡、意大利）*以及海上通道或边界地区。* +
在核战略和军事防御语境中，approaches 常用于指代接近某国的地理区域、通道, 或"外围防御区域"，即可能对国家安全构成威胁的"方向"。例如，海上接近（maritime approaches） 可能指的是通往法国的海域，而陆上接近（land approaches） 可能指的是法国边境地区。 +

因此，在 1972 年法国国防白皮书的背景下，French approaches 可能意味着法国不仅用核武器保卫"本土"，还可能用来保护"邻近地区"，以防止对法国自身安全产生间接影响的威胁。

This European dimension 欧洲维度 of French vital interests 法国重大利益 was really reiterated 重申 throughout the whole 整个 20th century 20世纪, with more or less advanced 先进的 ideas 想法. For example 例如, by the 1990s 1990年代, there were ideas 想法 about what we call dissuasion concertée 协同威慑—concerted deterrence 协同威慑力量—between France and some other European countries 其他欧洲国家 who might be ready to talk about 讨论 it. So, not sharing 分享 the decision 决定 to launch 发射 a nuclear weapon 核武器 and not deploying 部署 French nuclear weapons 法国核武器 in other countries 其他国家 like the U.S. extended deterrence 美国扩展威慑力量, but at least 至少 talking concretely 具体地 about how French nuclear weapons 法国核武器 could contribute to 贡献于 their defense 防御 and deterrence 威慑力量.

中文翻译:

法国"重大利益"的欧洲维度, 在整个20世纪中被真正重申，带有或多或少先进的想法。例如，到1990年代，有一些想法是我们所谓的"协同威慑"——法国与其他一些可能准备讨论的欧洲国家之间的协同威慑力量。所以，不是分享"发射核武器的决定"，也不是像美国扩展威慑力量那样, 在其他国家部署法国核武器，但至少具体地讨论法国核武器如何能贡献于他们的防御和威慑力量。

France is fully 完全地 independent 独立的 in the development 发展 of its nuclear weapons 核武器 regarding industrial capacities 工业能力—of course, the decision 决定 to launch 发射 a nuclear weapon 核武器—but in fact, it also contributes to 贡献于 NATO 北约, even though 尽管 we are not in the Nuclear Planning Group 核计划小组. We came back to 返回 the integrated command 综合指挥 of NATO 北约 in 2008. Several 几个 declarations 声明 acknowledge 承认 the role 角色 of France’s independent 独立的 nuclear deterrence 核威慑力量 and its contribution 贡献 to the global 全球的 NATO defense 防御 and deterrence posture 威慑态势, even though 尽管, for the moment 目前, France doesn’t participate in 参与, for example 例如, the Steadfast Noon exercises 坚定正午演习—the NATO nuclear exercises 北约核演习. But at the same time 同时, because the Supreme Allied Commander Transformation 盟军最高指挥官转型—so basically 基本上 one of the two top military chiefs 两个最高军事指挥官 of NATO 北约—is French, it means 意味着 that he can participate in 参与 the NPG 核计划小组. So, there is still 仍然 French representation 法国代表 in the nuclear decision-making groups 核决策小组 of NATO 北约.

中文翻译:

*法国在发展其核武器的工业能力方面, 是完全独立的——当然，"发射核武器的决定"也是如此*——但事实上，它也贡献于北约，尽管我们不在核计划小组中。我们在2008年返回了北约的综合指挥。几个声明承认法国"独立核威慑力量"的角色, 及其对全球北约防御和威慑态势的贡献，尽管目前法国没有参与，例如坚定正午演习——北约核演习。但同时，因为盟军最高指挥官转型——基本上是北约两个最高军事指挥官之一——是法国人，这意味着他可以参与核计划小组。所以，北约的核决策小组中仍然有法国代表。

French nuclear deterrence 法国核威慑力量 is independent 独立的 by nature 自然, but due to 由于 the strategic evolutions 战略演变 of the world 世界, the strategic competition 战略竞争, and the war 战争 in Ukraine 乌克兰, and so on 等等, France understands 理解 that it’s only for the benefit 利益 of everyone 每个人—including France—to further 进一步 contribute to 贡献于 NATO nuclear deterrence 北约核威慑力量 and also to the protection 保护 of European countries 欧洲国家. France came back to 返回 the military integrated command 军事综合指挥 of NATO 北约 in 2008—we never left 离开 the political bodies 政治机构 of NATO 北约, but Nicolas Sarkozy decided 决定 to come back to 返回 the military structures 军事结构 of NATO 北约 in 2008. He felt 感觉 that there was a change 变化 in the strategic environment 战略环境 that needed France to be back in 返回 a very efficient 高效的 military alliance 军事联盟.

中文翻译:

法国核威慑力量本质上是独立的，但由于世界的战略演变、战略竞争、乌克兰的战争等等，法国理解这只对每个人——包括法国——有益，进一步贡献于北约核威慑力量以及欧洲国家的保护。法国在2008年返回了北约的军事综合指挥——我们从未离开北约的政治机构，但尼古拉·萨科齐在2008年决定返回北约的军事结构。他感觉战略环境发生了变化，需要法国返回一个非常高效的军事联盟。

With Macron’s speech 马克龙的演讲 in February 2020, when he said very clearly 非常清楚地 that the French vital interests 法国重大利益 have a European dimension 欧洲维度 and that he was ready to 准备好 invite 邀请 European countries 欧洲国家 to learn more about 了解更多 the French nuclear deterrent 法国核威慑力量 and to build together 一起建立 a shared 共享的 strategic culture 战略文化 between European countries 欧洲国家—why did he say that 为什么这么说, and what does it mean 意味着什么? First, he said that because he saw 看到 the consequences 后果 of the first mandate 第一任期 of Donald Trump 唐纳德·特朗普, from 2017 to 2021, with the first scare 第一次恐惧 of the U.S. being less involved 较少参与 in the defense 防御 of Europe. It was also the consequence 后果 of Crimea’s annexation 克里米亚的吞并 by Russia 俄罗斯 in 2014—the fact 事实 that Europe didn’t really do anything about it 对此无能为力 apart from 除了 sanctions 制裁, and it was not really efficient 有效的 because we saw 看到 what it provoked 引发 in 2022 with the full-scale invasion 大规模入侵 of Ukraine 乌克兰. He felt 感觉 that the strategic environment 战略环境 was changing 变化 and that Europe might not be safe 不安全 from external aggression 外部侵略. So, it was time 是时候 to think collectively 集体思考 within Europe 在欧洲内部 about common defense 共同防御 and strategic deterrence 战略威慑力量.

中文翻译:

在**马克龙**2020年2月的演讲中，**他非常清楚地说，法国的"重大利益"具有欧洲维度，**他准备好邀请欧洲国家了解更多关于法国核威慑力量的信息，并一起建立欧洲国家之间的"共享战略"文化——他为什么这么说，这意味着什么？首先，他这么说因为他看到了唐纳德·特朗普第一任期（2017-2021）的后果，当时第一次恐惧**美国会较少参与欧洲防御。这也是2014年俄罗斯吞并克里米亚的后果——事实是欧洲除了制裁外, 对此无能为力，而且这(制裁)并不真的有效，因为我们看到了它在2022年引发了乌克兰的大规模入侵。**他感觉战略环境正在变化，欧洲可能不再能"安全地免受外部侵略"。所以，是时候在欧洲内部集体思考"共同防御"和"战略威慑力量"了。

He made his speech 发表演讲 in February 2020, and one month later 一个月后, the whole of Europe 整个欧洲 and almost 几乎 the whole world 整个世界 was in lockdown 封锁 because of COVID 新冠病毒. You can’t really talk about 讨论 nuclear deterrence 核威慑力量 with your partners 伙伴 on Zoom 视频会议软件. This invitation 邀请 was put aside 搁置 for two years 两年, also because I don’t think 我不认为 it was concrete 具体的 enough 足够, and I don’t think 我不认为 that European countries 欧洲国家 were able to 能够 fully 完全地 understand 理解 why and what Macron meant 马克龙的意思 through that sentence 那句话. But we saw 看到 a new momentum 新动力 for this French proposition 法国提议 about contributing to 贡献于 European defense 欧洲防御 after February 2022 在2022年2月之后, when we now have 有 a full-scale war 大规模战争 on European territory 欧洲领土 and the U.S. support 支持 might not have been as intense 强烈的 as expected 预期.

中文翻译:

他在2020年2月发表了演讲，一个月后，**由于新冠病毒，整个欧洲和几乎整个世界都处于封锁状态。你无法真正在视频会议软件上来与你的伙伴讨论"核威慑力量"。这个邀请被搁置了两年，**也因为**我不认为它足够具体，我也不认为欧洲国家能够完全理解马克龙那句话的意思和原因。**但我们在2022年2月之后看到了法国提议为"欧洲防御"贡献的新动力，当时欧洲领土上有一场大规模战争，美国的支持可能不如预期的那样强烈。

France is not there to replace 替换 the U.S. extended deterrence 美国扩展威慑力量—first, because we can’t 我们不能. We don’t have the political credibility 政治可信度 to do it 做到; we don’t have enough 足够的 warheads 弹头 to fully 完全地 replace 替换 the U.S. extended deterrence 美国扩展威慑力量. The idea is more to give 给予 an additional 额外的 layer 层 of security 安全 and additional 额外的 insurance 保险 and to play on 利用 the fact 事实 that a limited 有限的 intervention 干预, for example 例如, by Russia 俄罗斯 on Poland 波兰 that would threaten 威胁 Poland’s vital interests 波兰的重大利益 would necessarily 必然 have consequences 后果 on French vital interests 法国重大利益 because of the construction 结构 of Europe, because of the linkage 联系 between Poland 波兰 and France, for example 例如. That’s where the biggest difference 最大区别 lies 在于 between France not really extending 扩展 deterrence 威慑力量 but offering 提供 a possible 可能的 French contribution 法国贡献 to European defense 欧洲防御 and the U.S. deterrence 美国威慑力量—because France is directly 直接地 concerned 关心 in its own existence 存在 by everything that can happen 发生 on the European continent 欧洲大陆. It’s less the case 情况 for the United States.

中文翻译:

法国不是要顶替美国来扩展"威慑力量"——首先，因为我们不能。我们没有做到这一点的政治可信度；我们没有足够的弹头, 来完全替换美国扩展威慑力量。我们的想法只是更多是给予"额外的安全层"和"额外的保险"，并利用一个事实，例如，**俄罗斯对波兰的有限干预, 会威胁波兰的"重大利益"，必然会对法国的"重大利益"产生后果，**因为欧洲的结构，因为波兰和法国之间的联系，例如。这就是法国不真正扩展威慑力量, 但提供可能的法国对欧洲防御的贡献与美国威慑力量之间最大区别所在——因为法国直接关心其在欧洲大陆上可能发生的一切对其自身存在的影响。而对美国来说情况就不那么如此了。

That’s why France developed 发展 its own independent 独立的 nuclear deterrence 核威慑力量—because we didn’t really believe 相信 in this U.S. extended deterrence 美国扩展威慑力量. That’s why France considers 认为 itself maybe not more credible 更可信 but at least 至少 credible 可信的, to give 给予 this additional 额外的 layer 层 of insurance 保险 to willing 自愿的 European countries 欧洲国家. But again 再次, there is a difference 区别 between the U.S. and this French offer 法国提议 because, for the moment 目前, there are no talks 谈判 about putting 放置 French nuclear weapons 法国核武器 outside of 在…之外 French territory 法国领土—first, because it would be difficult 困难 regarding 关于 the Non-Proliferation Treaty 不扩散条约. The idea is more to advance 前进, let’s say 比如说, on the political side 政治方面, trying to find 试图找到 at a very high level 非常高的层次 shared 共享的 vital interests 重大利益 between, for example 例如, France and Sweden 瑞典 or France and Germany 德国, and thinking about 考虑 the military translation 军事转化 of this political commitment 政治承诺—for example 例如, participation 参与 of foreign armies 外国军队 in French nuclear exercises 法国核演习, maybe having the French Air Force 法国空军 nuclear raid 核袭击 exercises 演习 take place 发生 outside of 在…之外 French airspace 法国领空, having many visits 多次访问 of foreign diplomats 外国外交官 to the SSBN base 核潜艇基地, for example 例如. There are plenty 大量 of ideas 想法, but we are lacking 缺乏 French political guidance 法国政治指导 about it.

中文翻译:

这就是为什么法国发展了自己的"独立核威慑力量"——因为我们并不真正相信美国的扩展威慑力量。这就是为什么法国认为自己也许不是更可信，但至少是可信的，来为自愿的欧洲国家, 提供这一额外的保险层。但再次，美国和这个法国提议之间是有区别的，因为**目前没有关于将法国核武器放置在法国领土之外的谈判**——首先，因为这关于不扩散条约会很困难。**因此目前的想法更多是，比如说，在政治方面前进，试图在非常高的层次, 找到"共享的重大利益"，**例如法国和瑞典或法国和德国之间，**并考虑这个政治承诺的军事转化——例如，外国军队前来参与法国的核演习，或让法国空军的核袭击演习, 能发生在法国的领空之外，**例如有外国外交官多次访问核潜艇基地。虽然有大量的想法，但我们目前还缺乏关于此的法国"在政治层面上的指导"。

The role 角色 played 扮演 by French nuclear deterrence 法国核威慑力量 for Europe has been recognized 承认 very early on 很早就. At the time of 在…时期 General de Gaulle 戴高乐将军, there was already 已经 this idea 想法 that the French nuclear forces 法国核力量, just by their position 位置 in Europe and the fact 事实 that, obviously 显然, if France was under attack 受到攻击, other countries 其他国家 would have been invaded 入侵 by the Soviet Union 苏联, we would probably 大概 not wait 等待 until the Soviet Union 苏联 was at the border 在边界 to actually react 反应. After the Cold War 冷战之后, there was some discussion 讨论 at a very high political level 非常高的政治层次 about the role 角色 that French nuclear forces 法国核力量 play 扮演. There was not a lot of interest 兴趣 from European partners 欧洲伙伴. Today, two trends 趋势 are pushing 推动 the topic 话题 back a bit 稍微回来 on the agenda 议程. The first one 第一个 is that the security situation 安全局势 is worsening 恶化 in Europe—European partners 欧洲伙伴 are more inclined 倾向于 to see 看待 nuclear deterrence 核威慑力量 as something that can contribute to 贡献于 their security 安全. The second factor 第二个因素 is that U.S. extended deterrence 美国扩展威慑力量 can appear 显得 less reliable 可靠 because of Donald Trump 唐纳德·特朗普. It’s expected 预期 that the U.S. is not going to continue 继续 to be so active 活跃 and present 存在 to defend 防御 European security 欧洲安全 but might be more willing 自愿的 to commit 投入 its resources 资源 to the Asia-Pacific theater 亚太战区. These trends 趋势 have really increased 增加 the interest 兴趣 and the thinking 思考 here in Paris, but also elsewhere 在其他地方, that France is now 现在 the only 唯一的 nuclear power 核力量 on the continent 大陆 of Europe.

中文翻译:

法国核威慑力量为欧洲扮演的角色, 很早就被承认。在戴高乐将军时期，已经有这样的想法，即法国核力量仅仅因为它们在欧洲的位置和显然的事实，如果法国受到攻击，其他国家会被苏联入侵，我们大概不会等到苏联到达边界才真正反应。冷战之后，在非常高的政治层次上, 有一些关于"法国核力量该扮演的角色"的讨论。欧洲伙伴没有太多兴趣。今天，两个趋势稍微将这个话题推回了议程。第一个是欧洲的安全局势正在恶化——欧洲伙伴更倾向于将"核威慑力量"视为能贡献于他们安全的东西。第二个因素是由于唐纳德·特朗普，美国扩展威慑力量显得不那么可靠。预期美国不会继续如此活跃和存在, 来防御欧洲的安全，而可能更愿意将其资源投入亚太战区。这些趋势确实增加了巴黎以及其他地方的兴趣和思考，因为法国现在是欧洲大陆上唯一的核力量。

France has some interests 利益 outside of 在…之外 its borders 边界, and if some countries 一些国家 were attacked 大规模 attacked 大规模攻击 in Europe, it would affect 影响 its vital interests 重大利益. It’s not so much 不是那么 an extended deterrence 扩展威慑力量 as in NATO 北约, but more 更多 a recognition 承认 that there are interests 利益 in the security 安全 of Europe, and therefore 因此 independent 独立的 nuclear deterrence 核威慑力量 can play a role 扮演角色 in protecting 保护—indirectly 间接地—other European nations 其他欧洲国家.

中文翻译:

**法国在其边界之外有一些利益，如果欧洲的一些国家遭到大规模攻击，会影响其"重大利益"。**这不像北约那样的扩展威慑力量，而更多是承认欧洲的安全中有利益，因此独立的核威慑力量可以在保护——间接地——其他欧洲国家中扮演角色。

==== Expanding the Role of French Nuclear Deterrence
Our next guest reflects 反思 on recent 最近的 conversations 对话 about expanding 扩展 the role 角色 of French nuclear weapons 法国核武器 beyond 超越 functioning 运作 as a national deterrent 国家威慑力量. 'I’m Livia Horowitz. I work for 为…工作 the SWP in Berlin 柏林SWP, and I generally 通常 do research 研究 on nuclear policy 核政策 issues 问题 and particularly 特别地 on nuclear deterrence 核威慑力量. What could be the purpose 目的 of the French nuclear arsenal 法国核军火库 for European security 欧洲安全? Is this a complementary 补充的 element 元素 in relation to 关于 the arsenal 军火库 of the United States or to the security assurances 安全保证 that Washington offers 提供 its European allies 欧洲盟友? Or is this a replacement 替换 should the United States decide 决定 to withdraw 撤回 its nuclear assurances 核保证 towards 朝向 Europe? Some people argue 争辩 that it’s possible 可能的 for France to replace 替换 the United States, but the majority 大多数 argue 争辩 that, given 鉴于 current constraints 当前限制—be they in relation to 关于 France’s arsenal 法国军火库, but also in relation to 关于 France’s relations 关系 with its neighbors 邻国, also regarding 关于 France’s position 地位 in the European architecture 欧洲架构—that this is not possible 不可能.

中文翻译:

我们的下一位嘉宾, 反思了最近关于扩展法国核武器角色"超越作为国家威慑力量"的对话。‘我是利维娅·霍洛维茨。我在柏林SWP工作，通常研究核政策问题，特别是核威慑力量。**法国核军火库对"欧洲安全"的目的是什么？这是关于美国军火库, 或华盛顿为其欧洲盟友提供的安全保证的一个补充元素吗？或者，如果美国决定撤回对欧洲的核保证，这是一个替代吗？**一些人争辩说法国有可能替换美国，但大多数人争辩说，鉴于当前限制——无论是关于法国军火库，还是关于法国与其邻国的关系，也关于法国在欧洲架构中的地位——这是不可能的。’

Then comes the next dimension 维度 of what we need to change 改变, and the problem 问题 is that the dimension 维度 of change 改变 that would need to happen 发生 is simply 仅仅 very large 非常大. Many things 很多事情 would need to happen 发生 for France to be able to 能够 take on 承担 that role 角色. Those changes 改变 are expensive 昂贵的, both from a financial perspective 财务角度 and, more importantly 更重要的是, from a political 政治的 and strategic 战略的 perspective 角度. For those to happen 发生, we would need to have 需要 a political imperative 政治必要性. Conversely 相反地, the suggestions 建议 that everybody brings to the table 提出 today are all small steps 小步骤 that would happen 发生 within the current architecture 当前架构 that is not confronted with 面临—at least 至少 at Time Zero 零时, at that point in time 那个时间点 now—basically 基本上 is not confronted with 面临 such large pressure 巨大压力 that would warrant 证明…合理 those massive 大规模的 changes 改变 in doctrine 原则, in arsenal 军火库, in security approach 安全方法. A lot of the proposals 提议 are very good at 在…方面很好 enhancing 增强 France’s role 法国角色 in European security 欧洲安全 and creating 创建 an additional 额外的 or better-positioned 更好定位的 additional pillar 额外的支柱 in European nuclear deterrence 欧洲核威慑力量, but in no way 绝不 would those steps 步骤 suffice 足够 for France to replace 替换 the United States.

中文翻译:

接下来是我们需要改变的下一个维度，问题是需要改变的维度非常大。**法国要承担起这一角色，还需要做很多事情。无论是从财政角度，还是从更重要的政治和战略角度来看，这些变化都是昂贵的。**要实现这些，我们需要一种政治上的迫切需要。相反，**今天每个人提出的建议都是在"当前架构内"发生的小步骤，**至少在时间零点，在现在的时间点上，基本上没有面临如此大的压力，不足以保证在理论、武器库和安全方法上发生巨大的变化。许多建议都非常有利于加强法国在欧洲安全中的作用，并在欧洲核威慑中, 创造一个额外的或更好定位的额外支柱，但这些步骤绝不足以让法国取代美国。


Why are we talking about 讨论 France in the first place 首先? Because Emmanuel Macron 埃马纽埃尔·马克龙, a couple of years ago 几年前, held a speech 发表演讲 in which he basically 基本上 said, "You folks 你们这些人, come to 来 Paris 巴黎, and we’ll talk about 讨论 nuclear deterrence 核威慑力量," and nobody really understood 理解 what was on the table 在讨论中, what he was actually talking about 实际讨论什么. As people asked more questions 提出更多问题, it became clear 变得清楚 there was one educational 教育的 component 组成部分. France thought 认为 it could share 分享 more about how to educate 教育 its neighbors 邻国 on how nuclear deterrence 核威慑力量 works 运作 and why it is so important 重要 to have nuclear deterrence 核威慑力量. This was a couple of years ago 几年前. A lot of the countries 很多国家 in Europe were not very convinced 确信 in the first place 首先 that nuclear weapons 核武器 were necessary 必要的. That perception 看法 has been significantly 显著地 or severely 严重地 altered 改变 through Russia’s war 俄罗斯战争 against Ukraine 对抗乌克兰 and the use 使用 of nuclear rhetoric 核言论 by Moscow 莫斯科, and hence 因此 maybe that component 组成部分 is slightly 轻微地 muted 减弱.

中文翻译:

我们为什么要讨论法国呢？因为几年前，埃马纽埃尔·马克龙（Emmanuel Macron）发表了一次演讲，他基本上是说，“各位，来巴黎吧，我们来谈谈核威慑。”没有人真正理解谈判桌上的内容，他实际上在说什么。随着人们提出的问题越来越多，很明显其中有一个教育因素。法国认为，它可以分享更多关于如何教育邻国了解核威慑如何运作, 以及拥有核威慑为何如此重要的信息。这是几年前的事了。许多欧洲国家一开始就不太相信核武器是必要的。由于俄罗斯对乌克兰的战争以及莫斯科使用核言论，这种看法已经被显著或严重地改变了，因此，这种看法可能略有减弱。



The other component 组成部分 was France’s offer 提议 to get other states 其他国家 in Europe involved in 参与 its own nuclear exercises 核演习, in its own thinking 思考 about nuclear policy 核政策. However 然而, that involvement 参与 is mainly 主要地 geared towards 针对 creating 创建 some redundancy 冗余—not taking over 接管 parts 部分 of France’s nuclear deterrence 法国核威慑力量 or nuclear responsibilities 核责任, nuclear arsenal 核军火库, but adding 添加 a couple of layers 几层 potentially 潜在地, as we go down the road 随着发展, and at first 首先 becoming more familiar 熟悉 with how the French are doing 进行 nuclear deterrence 核威慑力量. This is the starting point 起点, and on top of 在…之上 this starting point 起点, a number of 一些 both officials 官员 and experts 专家 have placed 放置 various 各种 steps 步骤 that could be taken 采取—where exactly 具体在哪里, which kind of exercise 哪种演习 could be attended 参加, what kind of capabilities 能力, who could add to 添加到 the French dimension 法国维度, and so on 等等.

中文翻译:

另一个组成部分, 是法国提出让欧洲其他国家参与自己的核演习，参与其关于核政策的思考。然而，这种参与主要是为了创造一些冗余——不是接管法国的部分核威慑或核责任，核武库，而是增加一些层次，随着我们的发展，首先要熟悉法国是如何进行核威慑的。这是一个起点，在这个起点之上，许多官员和专家提出了可以采取的各种步骤——具体在哪里，可以参加哪种演习，什么样的能力，谁可以增加法国的维度，等等。


Then, of course 当然, there was quite a bit 相当多的 of discussion 讨论, for instance 例如, about funding 资助 French nuclear efforts 法国核努力. Numerous 众多的 people 人们, also in Germany 德国, advanced 前进 the proposition 提议, "The French need 需要 money 钱; we have maybe 也许 a bit of 一点 money 钱; we should do 应该做 that." And then the voices 声音 responded 回应 with, "No, you don’t understand 理解; that’s not at all 根本不是 what we actually meant 实际意思." There was dialogue 对话 that was not exactly 确切地 on the same wavelength 同波长 between what the government 政府 in Paris 巴黎 has in mind 考虑 and what various 各种 commentators 评论员 actually believe 相信 to be ideal 理想的. So, those are just another slight 轻微的 incongruence 不一致 about who wants what 谁想要什么.

中文翻译:

当然，随后也有不少讨论，例如，关于为法国核项目提供资金的问题。许多人，包括德国人，提出了这样的主张：“法国人需要钱；我们可能有一些钱；我们应该这么做。”然后那些声音回应道：“不，你不明白；这根本不是我们真正的意思。”在巴黎政府的想法, 和各种评论家认为的理想之间，有一些对话并不完全一致。所以，这些只是关于谁想要什么的另一个轻微的不一致。

If you talk to 与…交谈 French officials 法国官员, they say 说, "Come to 来 Paris 巴黎, and we will talk about 讨论 how nuclear deterrence 核威慑力量 should happen 应该发生, how various 各种 countries 国家 should position 定位 themselves in various 各种 UN fora 联合国论坛, also towards 朝向 other pieces 部分 of nuclear diplomacy 核外交, and then we will take it further 进一步推进 from there 从那里." Basically 基本上, "We cannot put anything on the table 提出任何东西 for as long as 只要 we don’t know 知道 where the discussion 讨论 is going to take us 带我们去哪里." Conversely 相反地, if you ask 询问 officials 官员 in Berlin 柏林, they say 说, "Why would we come to 来 Paris 巴黎 if we don’t know 知道 what you want to exactly 确切地 talk about 讨论?" So, one side 一方 says 说, "Let’s talk 让我们讨论, and we’ll see 看看 where the road 道路 leads us 带领我们," and the other side 另一方 says 说, "If we don’t know 知道 where you want to go 想去哪里, then why would we start 开始 on the road 道路?"

中文翻译:

如果你与法国官员交谈，他们说，‘来巴黎，我们将讨论核威慑力量应该如何发生，各种国家如何在各种联合国论坛中定位自己，也朝向核外交的其他部分，然后我们将从那里进一步推进。’基本上，‘只要我们不知道讨论会带我们去哪里，我们就不能提出任何东西。’相反地，*如果你询问柏林的官员，他们说，‘如果我们不知道你确切想讨论什么，我们为什么要来巴黎？’所以，一方说，‘让我们来讨论，看看道路会带领我们去哪里，’而另一方说，‘如果我们不知道你想去哪里，那我们为什么要开始走这条路？’*

A lot of people 很多人 have given thoughts 思考 to how to react 反应 to Moscow’s rhetoric 莫斯科的言论, and French officials 法国官员 have been quite purposeful 有目的的 about making 做出 various 各种 statements 声明, especially 尤其 at the beginning 开始 of Russia’s war 俄罗斯战争 against Ukraine 对抗乌克兰—making 做出 not only statements 声明 as to France also being a nuclear power 核力量, another center 中心 of decision 决定 influencing 影响 Russia’s calculations 计算, but also by taking 采取 clear 清楚的 measures 措施, sending 发送 another submarine 潜艇 out at sea 出海 and hence 因此 signaling 信号 to Moscow 莫斯科 that they also are playing a role 扮演角色. However 然而, in the grand scheme of things 在大局中, most nuclear communication 核沟通 throughout this crisis 危机 came from 来自 Washington 华盛顿, and if one is to believe 相信 what Russian officials 俄罗斯官员 say 说 in public 公开地, they also seem 似乎 to be significantly 显著地 more concerned 关心 with Washington’s signals 华盛顿的信号 and Washington’s positions 华盛顿的立场 than they are with either London’s 伦敦的 or Paris’s actions 巴黎的行动. But this is obviously 显然 just from watching 观察 open-source statements 开源声明. How the Russians react 俄罗斯人反应, what kind of discussions 讨论 they have behind closed doors 私下—that nobody knows 没人知道.

中文翻译:

很多人都在思考, 如何对莫斯科的言论做出反应，法国官员发表了各种声明，尤其是在俄罗斯对乌克兰开战之初，他们不仅声明法国也是一个核大国，这是影响俄罗斯决策的另一个中心，而且还采取了明确的措施，派遣另一艘潜艇出海，从而向莫斯科发出信号，表明他们也在发挥作用。然而，总的来说，在这场危机中，大多数核信息都来自华盛顿，如果人们相信俄罗斯官员的公开言论，他们似乎也更关心华盛顿的信号和立场，而不是伦敦或巴黎的行动。但这显然只是通过观察开源声明得出的结论。俄罗斯人会作何反应，他们私下有什么样的讨论——没人知道。



At the other end of the spectrum 在光谱的另一端 is the fundamental 基本的 question of what would happen if the Americans were to rescind 撤销 their nuclear assurances 核保证, basically, from Europe. In other words 换句话说—and it’s worth mentioning 值得一提 that there is a bit of 一点 confusion 困惑, also in Germany , but also throughout 遍及 the commentariat 评论界, with a lot of people believing that it is possible for the United States to say, "We’re not doing 不做 nuclear deterrence 核威慑力量, but we’re doing other sorts 其他种类 of security assurances 安全保证." Extended nuclear deterrence 扩展核威慑力量 is the last 最后, and not the first 第一, step 步骤 in Europe 在欧洲. Even 即使 a Trump administration 特朗普政府 bent on 致力于 reducing 减少 the U.S. role in Europe would rather focus on the conventional 常规的 aspects 方面 and leave (v.) nuclear deterrence 核威慑力量 as the final step before they pack up 收拾 and go home.

中文翻译:

‘在光谱的另一端是基本的问题，如果美国人撤销他们对欧洲的核保证, 会发生什么，基本上，换句话说——值得一提的是，在德国也有点困惑，但也在评论界遍及，很多人相信美国有可能说，‘我们不做核威慑力量，但我们做其他种类的安全保证。’扩展核威慑力量是欧洲的最后一步，而不是第一步。即使一个致力于减少美国在欧洲角色的特朗普政府，也宁愿专注于常规方面，将核威慑力量作为他们收拾回家前的最后一步。’

Now, a lot of people 很多人 are really worried 担心 about the fate 命运 of the transatlantic 跨大西洋 security arrangements 安全安排 in a Trump administration 特朗普政府, and they are thinking 思考 about the hypothetical 假设 of ensuring 确保 European nuclear deterrence 欧洲核威慑力量 without 没有 the United States. The fundamental 基本的 problem 问题 is that extended deterrence 扩展威慑力量 is hard 困难的. The French are pretty good at 擅长 deterring 威慑 an adversary 对手 from attacking 攻击 France, but how credible 可信的 were they to argue 争辩 that they provide 提供 extended deterrence 扩展威慑力量 for all of Europe 整个欧洲? There are two questions 问题: Do the Russians believe 相信 them? And the second 第二个, and more important 更重要的, question 问题 is: Do their allies 盟友 believe 相信 them? Do they feel 感觉 sufficiently 足够地 secure 安全的 under such a promise 承诺 to A) not develop 发展 their own nuclear weapons 自己的核武器, or B) not go to 去 Moscow 莫斯科 and strike 达成 some sort of parallel 平行的 deals 交易 in order to preempt 预先阻止 the possibility 可能性 of Russian nuclear coercion 俄罗斯核胁迫? And some of these nations 这些国家 might not be willing 不愿意 to do 做 one or the other 两者之一. They might run first 首先跑 to Washington 华盛顿 to see 看看 whether there is some sort of bilateral 双边的 option 选择 there.

现在，很多人真的很担心特朗普政府下跨大西洋安全安排的命运，他们在考虑在没有美国的情况下 , 确保欧洲核威慑的假设。*根本的问题是扩展威慑很难。法国人很擅长阻止对手来攻击法国，但他们声称自己为整个欧洲提供了延伸威慑的说法, 有多可信？有两个问题：俄罗斯人相信他们吗？第二个更重要的问题是：他们的盟友相信他们吗？在这样的承诺下，他们是否感到足够安全，以至于：a)不发展自己的核武器，或者 B)不去莫斯科达成某种平行协议，以先发制人地阻止俄罗斯核胁迫的可能性？其中一些国家可能不愿意做上面两种选中的其中一件事。他们可能会先去华盛顿，看看是否有某种"美国单独保证该国安全"的双边选择。*


Assuming 假设 that everybody 每个人 would be on the same page 在同一页上 that France would try to do 试图做 it, the question 问题 is: How credible 可信的 is it? For the United States, it’s been pretty hard 相当困难 to reassure 使安心 the Europeans 欧洲人. It had built 建造 a relatively 相对地 large 大的 and relatively 相对地 diverse 多样的 nuclear arsenal 核军火库 and has also integrated 整合 its European partners 欧洲伙伴 in some form 某种形式 of consultative process 协商过程. Most people 大多数人 inherently 固有地 look at 看待 this example 例子 of how it’s been done 完成 in the past 过去 and think 思考 how France could adapt 适应 its posture 态势, its forces 力量, to fit 适应 more that sort of arrangement 安排. Because France has a much, much smaller 更小 and much, much less diversified 更少样化的 nuclear arsenal 核军火库, it doesn’t have any sort 任何种类 of institutional framework 制度框架 in which it would be able to 能够 integrate 整合 its allies 盟友. The road 道路 is very long 很长. Yes, it’s possible 可能的, but it’s very expensive 昂贵的, very cumbersome 繁琐的, and basically 基本上, Paris 巴黎 would have to do 必须做 a lot 很多 in order to achieve 实现 even a moderately 适度地 similar 相似的 outcome 结果 or even go in that direction 朝那个方向前进.

中文翻译:
假设所有人都同意法国会尝试这么做，问题是：这有多可信？对美国来说，使欧洲人安心已经相当困难。它已经建立了一个相对庞大和相对多样化的核武库，并将其欧洲伙伴纳入某种形式的协商进程。大多数人本能地看到这个例子，看到过去是如何做的，并思考法国如何调整其姿态，其力量，以适应更多的这种安排。因为法国的核武库规模要小得多，而且多样化程度也要低得多，所以它没有任何能够整合其盟友的制度框架。这条路很长。是的，这是可能的，但它非常昂贵，非常麻烦，基本上，巴黎必须做很多事情才能达到适度相似的结果，甚至朝着那个方向发展。


Many people 很多人, conversely 相反地, have argued 争辩—have proposed 提议—that less 更少 would be sufficient 足够的, and the question 问题 is: How much less 更少多少? The fundamental 基本的 question 问题 here is not whether 是否 you need 需要 the large 大型的 arsenal 军火库, because France already 已经 has sufficient 足够的 nuclear weapons 核武器 to inflict 造成 unacceptable 不可接受的 damage 损害 on the Russian Federation 俄罗斯联邦. If it were to inflict 造成 such unacceptable 不可接受的 damage 损害 on the Russian Federation 俄罗斯联邦, Moscow 莫斯科 could answer 回应 by also inflicting 造成 unacceptable 不可接受的 damage 损害 on France. The question 问题 then becomes 变成: How do you persuade 说服 your allies 盟友 that you’re willing 自愿的 to potentially 潜在地 accept 接受 such tremendous 巨大的 cost 代价 in order to protect 保护 them, so as to 以便 deter 威慑 the other side 另一方 from even trying 甚至尝试 to test 测试 your resolve 决心—to actually push 推动 you to see 看看 whether you’re actually serious 认真的 about your promises 承诺?

中文翻译:

相反，许多人认为——或者提出——少一点就足够了，问题是：少多少？*这里的根本问题不是你是否需要庞大的核武库，因为法国已经拥有足够的核武器，足以对俄罗斯联邦造成不可接受的损害。#如果它要对俄罗斯联邦造成这种不可接受的损害，莫斯科也可以对法国造成不可接受的损害作为回应。那么问题就变成了：你如何说服你的盟友，你愿意为了保护他们而付出如此巨大的代价，从而阻止对方甚至试图测试你的决心——实际上迫使你看看你是否真的在认真对待你的承诺？ (说得很对, 意思就是, 你法国要保护盟友的话, 可能会冒着自己被俄罗斯核武器毁灭的危险. 那么你法国真的有决心愿意付出这样巨大的代价, 来帮助盟友吗? 盟友会相信你的这种"为朋友宁可自己两肋插刀"决心吗?)#*


And hence 因此, within this framework 框架, the solution chosen by the United States was to diversify 多样化 its nuclear arsenal 核军火库, to have the ability  to not immediately 立即 go for 追求 countervalue 等值；打击社会财富—for hitting 打击 population centers 人口中心, for hitting very important and crucial 关键的 targets on the other side —but to use 使用 nuclear weapons 核武器 in the theater 战区, to use nuclear weapons  to attack the arsenal 军火库 of the other power 另一方力量, and hence 因此 to keep 保持 this strategic 战略的 dimension 维度 of going all-in 全力以赴 further down the road 在未来, thus increasing its own credibility 可信度 that it might potentially 潜在地 use (v.) nuclear weapons  in defense 防御 of their allies 盟友. This is just one way 一种方式 of doing this.

中文翻译:

因此，在这个框架内，美国选择的解决方案是, 使其核武库多样化，有能力不立即采取反击行动——打击"人口中心"，打击另一方"非常重要和关键的目标"——而是在战区使用核武器，使用核武器攻击另一方的武器库，从而保持这种全面投入的战略维度，从而增加了它自己的可信度，即它可能会使用核武器来保护自己的盟友。这只是一种方法。


You can increase 增加 your political credibility 政治可信度 by saying 说 the other side 另一方 is so important 重要 because we are the same country 同一个国家—they are not just allies 盟友 that we might or might not care about 关心, but we have a political union 政治联盟. So, were Europeans 欧洲人 to create 创建 a supranational 超国家的 entity 实体—basically 基本上 a United States of Europe 欧洲合众国—probably 大概 a pretty small 相当小的 nuclear arsenal 核军火库 would be sufficient 足够的 for everybody 每个人. Maybe even 甚至 the arsenal 军火库 that France and Britain 英国 together 一起 have today 今天 might be sufficient 足够的 to provide 提供 overarching 全面的 nuclear deterrence 核威慑力量. Then we would have to look at 考虑 the conventional 常规的 aspects 方面 and what is credible 可信的 to defend 防御 our borders 边界 within this situation 情况. But we don’t have 没有 a United States of Europe 欧洲合众国.

中文翻译:

‘你可以通过说另一方是如此重要来增加你的政治可信度，因为我们是同一个国家——他们不仅是盟友，我们可能关心也可能不关心，而是我们有一个政治联盟。所以，如果欧洲人创建了一个超国家的实体——基本上是欧洲合众国——大概一个相当小的核军火库就足够每个人使用。也许甚至今天法国和英国一起拥有的军火库就足以提供全面的核威慑力量。然后我们必须考虑常规方面以及在这种情况下防御我们边界的什么才是可信的。但我们没有一个欧洲合众国。’

The next question 下一个问题 is: What else 还有什么 can be done 完成 beyond 超越 that nuclear dimension 核维度, beyond 超越 that large 大型的 arsenal 军火库, and so on 等等? The other question 另一个问题 is: How do you demonstrate 展示, if we don’t have 没有 a political union 政治联盟 and not one state 一个国家—you’re not protecting 保护 your citizens 公民 that elect 选举 the central government 中央政府 that they are all deserving of 值得 your protection 保护—how do you demonstrate 展示 still 仍然 that you care enough 足够关心? You can do that 做到, for instance 例如, by deploying 部署 a lot of military personnel 大量军事人员 towards 朝向 the borders 边界 that are most endangered 最危险的. We’re talking here about 谈论 hundreds of thousands 数十万 of soldiers 士兵, and they will basically 基本上 fight 作战 for those allies 盟友. They will fight 作战 a long fight 长时间战斗, they will die 死亡, and you will then reinforce 增援 them. You will transform 转变 your economy 经济, you will fight 作战 a conventional war 常规战争 for Europe—for your allies 盟友—and that conventional war 常规战争 might then escalate 升级 to the nuclear level 核级别, at which point 到那时 it’s unquestionable 无可争议的 that your fundamental 基本的 interests 利益 are being touched 触及, and hence 因此 you will then go to 前进到 the nuclear level 核级别, and you might actually 实际上 be able to escalate 升级.

中文翻译:

下一个问题是：除了核武器，除了庞大的武器库等等，我们还能做些什么？另一个问题是：如果我们没有一个政治联盟，没有一个国家，你如何证明，你没有保护选举中央政府的公民，他们都值得你的保护，你如何证明你仍然足够关心？你可以这样做，例如，向最危险的边境部署大量军事人员。我们在这里谈论的是成千上万的士兵，他们基本上会为那些盟友而战。他们会打很长时间的仗，他们会死，然后你会增援他们。你会改变你的经济，你会为欧洲和你的盟友打一场常规战争，而这场常规战争可能会升级到核战争的程度，毫无疑问，你的根本利益会受到触动，因此你会进入核战争的程度，你实际上可能会升级。

It is not impossible 不可能 to do it 做到—it’s creating 创建 that plausibility 可信性, ensuring 确保 the other nations 其他国家 that you’re actually 实际上 willing 自愿的 to do it 做到—that’s rather difficult 相当困难. If we look at 考虑 the political problems 政治问题 that France seems 似乎 to have today 今天, that seems 似乎 to be a bridge 桥梁 that is rather hard 相当难 to cross 跨越.

中文翻译:

要做到这一点并非不可能——要创造这种可能性，确保其他国家确实愿意这么做——这是相当困难的。如果我们看看法国今天所面临的政治问题，那似乎是一座很难跨越的桥。


==== French Position on Arms Control
Emmanuel Metra concludes 总结 with thoughts 思考 on the French position 法国立场 on arms control 军备控制. 'Regarding 关于 the future 未来, the French vision 法国愿景 has always been rather cautious 相当谨慎的 and now is rather pessimistic 相当悲观的 about the evolution 演变 of the strategic environment 战略环境. There is really a willingness 意愿 to keep 保持 nuclear deterrence 核威慑力量 at the center 中心 of the defense policy 国防政策. Where France maybe 也许 is a bit unique 有点独特 is that it’s never really considered 认为 that nuclear weapons 核武器 were out of date 过时 or that they should become 变成 a less important 较不重要的 part 部分 of our military investments 军事投资. In the current context 当前背景下, it remains 保持 extremely 极其 central 中心的 and is really highlighted 突出 as something that is absolutely 绝对 necessary 必要的 to deal with 处理 the return 返回 of major power competition 大国竞争.

中文翻译:

埃马纽埃尔·梅特拉总结了法国在军备控制问题上的立场。“关于未来，法国的愿景一直相当谨慎，现在对战略环境的演变相当悲观。法国确实愿意将核威慑置于国防政策的中心。法国的独特之处在于，它从来没有真正认为核武器已经过时，或者它们应该成为我们军事投资中不那么重要的一部分。在当前的背景下，它仍然是非常重要的，并且确实被强调为"应对大国竞争回归"的绝对必要的东西。

France has observed 观察 the degradation 恶化 of the arms control environment 军备控制环境 and has been, once again 再次, thinking 思考 that, in the current context 当前背景下, strategic stability 战略稳定 was best served 最好服务于 by a strong 强大的 deterrence posture 威慑态势, with this idea 想法 that arms control 军备控制 and deterrence 威慑力量 are two things 两件事 that go together 一起 because they can both 两者都 prevent 防止 aggression 侵略 and they can both 两者都 avoid 避免 incentives 动机 for an adversary 对手 to start 开始 an aggression 侵略. This idea 想法 is that if we are strong 强大的 and if we are credible 可信的, the opponents 对手 are not going to feel 感觉 that there is a place 地方 for them to be successful 成功 in leading 领导 an aggression 侵略. This is really a message 信息 that is coming through 传递—that strategic stability 战略稳定 is served 服务于 by a strong 强大的 deterrence posture 威慑态势 and that the immediate 立即的 priority 优先级 is to invest 投资 and make sure 确保 that the deterrence posture 威慑态势 is credible 可信的 and well-funded 资金充足 across the board 全面 in France, in NATO 北约, and elsewhere 在其他地方.

中文翻译:
法国注意到军备控制环境的恶化，并再次认为，在目前的情况下，**战略稳定最好是由"强大的威慑态势"服务的，因为"军备控制"和"威慑"两者都是需要的, 缺一不可，因为它们既可以防止侵略，又可以避免刺激对手发动侵略。**这个想法是，**如果我们强大，如果我们可信，对手就不会觉得他们有"成功领导侵略"的余地。**这确实是一个信息，即战略稳定是由强大的威慑态势服务的，当务之急是投资并确保在法国、北约和其他地方的威慑态势, 是可信的和资金充足的。


The second element 第二个因素, I would say 我会说, goes hand in hand 密切相关 with efforts 努力 to work on 致力于 strategic risk reduction 战略风险减少 and to look where 看看哪里 there might be avenues 方法 to adopt 采取 some measures 措施—at the unilateral 单方面的 level 水平 or at the more multilateral 多边的 or any kind of 任何种类的 levels 水平—to see 看看 what measures 措施 would be useful 有用的 to limit 限制 the risks 风险. There have been some declarations 声明, for instance 例如, on keeping 保持 the human in the loop 人在回路中 regarding 关于 nuclear decision-making 核决策, or regarding 关于 space 太空, or regarding 关于 new technologies 新技术, and so on 等等.

中文翻译:

我想说，第二个要素与"减少战略风险"的努力密切相关，并寻找可能在哪些方面采取一些措施——在单边层面, 或更多边的层面, 或任何层面——看看哪些措施有助于限制风险。已经有一些声明，例如，关于让人类参与核决策、太空、新技术等方面的决策。


Regarding 关于 formal 正式的 arms control 军备控制 and the possibility 可能性 that we may see 看到 a follow-up 后续 of the New START treaty 新START条约 or INF treaty 中导条约, in principle 原则上, there is support 支持 for anything 任何东西 that can bring 带来 transparency 透明度 and avoid 避免 arms race dynamics 军备竞赛动态 among 在…之中 the major nuclear powers 主要核大国. There is some concern 担忧 if, for instance 例如, there are propositions 提议 coming from 来自 Russia 俄罗斯 that want to 想要 include 包括 the French and British 英国 arsenals 军火库 in the count 计算 of what Western nuclear weapons 西方的核武器 are, but otherwise 否则, if something 某事 looked 看起来 credible 可信的 and possible 可能的 to be verified 验证, France would probably 大概 support 支持 the initiative 倡议.

中文翻译:

关于正式的军备控制, 和我们可能会看到新START条约或中导条约后续的可能性. 原则上，我们支持任何能带来透明度, 并避免主要核大国之间军备竞赛动态的东西。如果，例如，来自俄罗斯的提议想要将法国和英国的军火库包括在西方核武器的计算中，那就会有些担忧，但否则，如果某事看起来可信且可能被验证，法国大概会支持这个倡议。’

What is interesting 有趣的, if we look at 考虑 other Western countries 其他西方国家, is really the fact 事实 that the French nuclear policy 法国核政策 is so central 中心的 in shaping 塑造 the whole military 整个军事 and in shaping 塑造 the investments 投资 that are being made 正在进行—in determining 决定 what kind of 哪种 planes 飞机 are going to be bought 购买 or how many 多少 attack submarines 攻击潜艇 are going to be procured 采购. It’s really central 中心的, and we see 看到 it when we talk with 与…交谈 people 人们 in the forces 部队—especially 尤其, of course 当然, the Navy 海军 and the Air Force 空军, which are really dimensioned 设计 to be able to carry 执行 that mission 任务. But there’s also something 某事 to be said 可以说 about the fact 事实 that there’s really no contestation 争议 or debate 辩论 about the continuity 持续性 of nuclear deterrence 核威慑力量 in France. It doesn’t mean 意味着 that there is broad support 广泛支持 or that the population 民众 is usually 通常 dedicated to 致力于 that, but there’s no debate 辩论 about it. There’s really no questioning 质疑 in the parliament 议会 or elsewhere 在其他地方.

中文翻译:
有趣的是，如果我们看看其他西方国家，就会发现, 法国的核政策在塑造整个军队和塑造正在进行的投资方面, 是如此重要——在决定将要购买哪种飞机, 或将要采购多少攻击型潜艇方面。这是非常重要的，当我们与军队中的人交谈时，我们看到了这一点，尤其是海军和空军，他们的规模确实能够执行这项任务。但是还有一点需要说明的是，在法国，对于核威慑的连续性, 并没有什么争论。这并不意味着有广泛的支持，也不意味着人们通常都致力于此，但这是没有争议的。在议会或其他地方真的没有质疑。

==== Introduction to the Program
Welcome to ACP. I'm your host, Alex Bues, the head of Strategy, Technology, and Arms Control at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Berlin. On each episode, we welcome the world's leading experts in arms control to share their knowledge and assessments of the most critical issues. Whether you're new to the topic or need a refresher, I hope you will join us in our exploration of everything related to arms control. In this season, we offer primers on all the nuclear weapons arsenals currently existing in the world and their relationship to arms control. I hope it helps you better understand a nuke.

==== Overview of France’s Nuclear Policy
It was obvious early on that France did not have the means to develop an arsenal that could be based on counterforce strategies or follow the trends of the Soviet Union or the U.S. But with the strategy you can afford... Today, we turn to France, a country that has long insisted on the independence of its deterrent. What drives its nuclear policy and its reluctance to engage in arms control? What role does it play in European security, and would it be possible to expand that role? To help us better understand this, we're joined by leading experts on French nuclear strategy.

==== Historical Development of French Nuclear Weapons
Our first guest is Éloïse Fette, the research fellow and head of the Deterrence and Proliferation Program at the French Institute of International Relations. 'Seeing the use of a nuclear weapon in Japan, seeing their development by the U.S. and by the USSR, the French government at the time understood that we needed a French nuclear weapon in order to gain status, in order to assure our own defense—French-owned deterrence. The bureau to create the first French nuclear weapon was created in 1954. There was a lot of money dedicated to the program, and when Charles de Gaulle came back to power in 1958 and became the French president within the Fifth Republic, he gave the final push to really get a French nuclear weapon to work and to be used within the deterrent and defense strategic posture of France. The first French nuclear test was in February 1960.

Emmanuel Metra, a senior nuclear weapons researcher at the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris, continues with the motivation behind the French nuclear program. 'The idea from Charles de Gaulle was that you cannot rely on an ally for your own security when a nuclear war is at stake, and that only a national deterrence can be really credible. At the time, it was probably influenced by events that the leaders had experienced. They had been deeply marked by the invasion twice of French territory—the defeats in 1940 and the Nazi invasion had really marked them. Other elements probably also had influence. After the Second World War, France was involved in colonial wars and realized that it could not rely on the support of its allies for these situations, in Indochina in particular, where the United States was not willing to commit very deeply. The Suez affair in 1956, which is often mentioned, also triggered this idea that France and Britain could not rely on the U.S. being always there to support their policy decisions. These elements contributed to creating this obsession with being sovereign, being independent in developing a nuclear deterrent.

==== Evolution of the French Nuclear Arsenal
Éloïse Fette continues the story with changes to the French nuclear arsenal at the end of the Cold War. 'During the Cold War, we had this full triad: a land component, airborne, and seaborne. At the end of the Cold War, because nuclear weapons were not as important as they were during the Cold War and it was about peace dividends, we had to reduce military expenses. It was decided to drop the ground component, especially because, in fact, they were partly made to target Germany in case of a Soviet invasion. When Germany was reunified, there were serious talks between France and Germany, and Germany explained it might be nice for you to drop the weapons that you could use to target our country. France complied. It was also because nuclear weapons were not really in favor anymore. It helped France to cut its arsenal by half, from around 600 strategic nuclear warheads by the end of the Cold War to around 300 strategic nuclear warheads today. Contrary to the U.S. or Russia, all the warheads are deployed; we don’t have warheads in reserve. They are spread between the four French SSBNs—nuclear submarines—and the two squadrons, around maybe 40 Rafale jets that can carry the nuclear airborne cruise missile of the French Strategic Air Force.

It was obvious early on that France did not have the means to develop an arsenal that could be based on counterforce strategies or follow the trends of the Soviet Union or the U.S. But with the strategy you can afford, it based it on the idea of strict sufficiency, which means that the goal is to have enough forces to create serious damage—damage that would be a deterrent for any attack from major adversaries—but not to go beyond and not to look at exactly all the targets you could actually consider in the adversary. This notion, however, can evolve. It is going to be built on a number of issues, including, for instance, how well the adversary is defending itself and how many weapons would be judged necessary to actually create that damage. So, it can be reviewed by the president.

==== French Nuclear Doctrine and Strategy
One of the specifics of the French nuclear doctrine is this notion of a final warning—or just a warning. France does not have the means, does not have the doctrine, to respond to a nuclear strike with a nuclear strike and try to escalate at the reciprocal level. It does not intend to lead a nuclear war or to do limited strikes—that is completely foreign to the French doctrine. However, there’s the idea that threatening to do nothing or to do a massive response could be a bit extreme and could lack credibility, and that it could be useful to have something in between. That something in between is this notion of a warning. The nuclear warning can happen in any situation; there’s no preset scenario where it could happen. It doesn’t have to happen at all. We could imagine a massive retaliation without a warning. At this stage, the president has this option of striking with this kind of limited strike, with the idea that maybe the adversary did not realize that it was crossing the threshold of French vital interests and that this warning shot is going to be a way for the adversary to understand that it has to back down. This warning is not going to be repeated, and the next time is going to be massive retaliation.

The notion of vital interests is really key and core and is repeated extensively—this idea that only the president can determine what a vital interest is or not. So, it’s really a personal responsibility to assess if the damage that the country has received or if the level of the attack is sufficient to lead to nuclear retaliation. This connection with the president of the Republic is really emphasized in the deterrence. Something that goes with that is that, while the doctrine itself is rather restrained in many ways, France does not accept formal restraints easily. The idea is really to keep options open for the president. We will not, for instance, declare a no-first-use policy or declare that nuclear weapons would only be used in response to nuclear aggression. There are other elements like this where France is very reluctant to commit because the idea is that, really, the president is going to judge if the situation falls within the field of nuclear deterrence or not. So, there is a kind of reluctance to commit in the current context to anything that could limit its freedom of action.

Within the French nuclear doctrine, there is this refusal of the idea of nuclear escalation and nuclear warfighting. That’s why we don’t have tactical nuclear weapons, contrary, for example, to the U.S., which has this idea of nuclear warfighting and the notion that a nuclear war could be fought. It’s not present in the French nuclear doctrine because a nuclear war on the European continent would be a nuclear war for everyone, and it won’t be limited. In fact, the current damage that can be done by nuclear warheads, even with a low yield, would be damaging for the whole country that is attacked. The integration between European countries is so huge, and the small scale of the European continent would make this limited nuclear war not limited at all for European countries.

==== Components of the French Nuclear Deterrent
The airborne component of the French nuclear deterrent is, in fact, divided in two. So, we have the Strategic Air Force, and we also have something else that is very unique to France. The U.S. used to have this by the end of the Cold War—it’s the naval nuclear air force, the Force Aéronavale Nucléaire (FANu). So, from the French Navy Air Force, they are able to land and take off from the French aircraft carrier with nuclear weapons. Basically, the French aircraft carrier is equipped to host nuclear weapons if needed—nuclear cruise missiles, if needed—and you have a part of the naval air force fleet that can carry nuclear weapons. It’s unique among nuclear weapon states. It gives additional flexibility to the French president. It’s also very useful for strategic signaling because if you have both the aircraft carrier and the Rafale Marine planes, and it is known that nuclear weapons are on board, and you sail near China or maybe in the Northern Atlantic, it gives a very strong signal that nuclear weapons could be used by the French president if the vital interests of France are being threatened by another nuclear weapon state.

So, it’s really short, meaning that we don’t have, like the U.S., for example, a nuclear posture review where we lay out precisely what French nuclear policy is. It’s only, in fact, a speech—meaning that each president gives, usually two or three years after their entry to power, a speech on the defense policy of France. Within this speech, they can include slight changes to the French nuclear doctrine based on their own understanding of the doctrine but also maybe their past experiences with nuclear weapons.

==== Continuity and Modernization of French Nuclear Doctrine
Since the end of the Cold War, the French nuclear doctrine has pretty much stayed the same: strictly defensive, made to deter any attack against vital interests. There are no lists of vital interests because if you say precisely to your adversary, "Okay, I will answer with nuclear weapons only if you hit this and this, but if you hit something else, I won’t answer," it limits flexibility. Usually, we understand vital interests as the integrity of the French state, its ability to still function as a state—also the integrity not of the whole territory, but at least not losing a whole region of France, like we did in the 19th century because of the war with the German Empire. It’s pretty broad and pretty narrow at the same time. It’s fully up to the French president to decide whether to use nuclear weapons, and that’s why the French president is directly elected—meaning that French citizens directly vote for who they want to be the president.

French presidents, on the first day of their mandate, are taken into the bunker from where they can see the whole situation regarding French nuclear weapons, and they are immediately given the codes and the processes to launch a nuclear weapon. So, the position of the French president is, in fact, very deeply linked to French nuclear deterrence. It takes time to write a speech on nuclear weapons—on nuclear deterrence—because it’s such a sensitive topic and really based on words. In fact, because, of course, the objective of nuclear weapons is not to use a nuclear weapon, you have to produce what we call strategic signaling in order to demonstrate your potential willingness to use nuclear weapons if needed. It can go through exercises, and it can go through speeches. So, it takes a lot of time to write one. For example, President Macron came to power in May 2017, and he made his speech in February 2020. It takes a lot of time, and many people asked about it—experts, but also officials and diplomats.

Two components—one airborne, one seaborne—are currently undergoing modernization. There are always programs to update the warheads, both for the cruise missiles and also for the submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The missiles themselves are being updated with new standards. So, the M51.3 standard of the SLBM missile was tested, I think, last year. We are expecting the standard M51.4 maybe in the next year or quite soon. And the ASMPA, the current cruise missile for the Strategic Air Force, is going to be replaced maybe in ten years—less than ten years, during the 2030s—with the ASN4G, which will be hypersonic. For the moment, the cruise missile is supersonic, and the next one will be hypersonic in order to have further maneuverability while keeping high supersonic speed.

The third generation of SSBNs should be put to sea again in around ten years. About the Rafale, it’s a bit more complicated because we’re supposed to build the Future Combat Air System with some European countries, but it doesn’t go as quickly as we would like. We might just need to continue updating the current fighter of the Air Force so it’s still able to conduct the nuclear raid. The two components are being modernized—both the carriers and the weapons. That’s why we see a slight increase in the budget of the French armed forces dedicated to nuclear weapons, because, of course, modernization is quite expensive.

We don’t have any plans to increase the number of warheads, first because all the installations to produce fissile plutonium were dismantled by the beginning of this century. It would be more difficult to produce fissile material to build new warheads. All the plutonium used in French nuclear warheads is recycled—when the warhead is too old, the fissile materials are removed and recycled in order to make new solid warheads. Also, all the testing facilities were dismantled 30 years ago. Contrary, for example, to Russia or the United States, France is not able to do nuclear tests again. We are a full signatory of the CTBT, the treaty against nuclear testing, meaning that we rely only on simulation programs—mathematical, physical, chemical simulation programs—to continue updating the French nuclear warheads.

==== French Nuclear Deterrence and European Security
The French contribution to the defense of Europe is a very old one. One of the first white papers about defense in France, in 1972—so it is considered the first strategic document on nuclear weapons and nuclear doctrine in France because we had the full triad by that time—states that French nuclear weapons are made to defend French vital interests, French territory, but also French approaches. So, what does it mean? We don’t really know, but it is interpreted as maybe the protection of France’s closest neighbors at the time—West Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, maybe Italy—against possible threats to their own vital interests.

This European dimension of French vital interests was really reiterated throughout the whole 20th century, with more or less advanced ideas. For example, by the 1990s, there were ideas about what we call dissuasion concertée—concerted deterrence—between France and some other European countries who might be ready to talk about it. So, not sharing the decision to launch a nuclear weapon and not deploying French nuclear weapons in other countries like the U.S. extended deterrence, but at least talking concretely about how French nuclear weapons could contribute to their defense and deterrence.

France is fully independent in the development of its nuclear weapons regarding industrial capacities—of course, the decision to launch a nuclear weapon—but in fact, it also contributes to NATO, even though we are not in the Nuclear Planning Group. We came back to the integrated command of NATO in 2008. Several declarations acknowledge the role of France’s independent nuclear deterrence and its contribution to the global NATO defense and deterrence posture, even though, for the moment, France doesn’t participate in, for example, the Steadfast Noon exercises—the NATO nuclear exercises. But at the same time, because the Supreme Allied Commander Transformation—so basically one of the two top military chiefs of NATO—is French, it means that he can participate in the NPG. So, there is still French representation in the nuclear decision-making groups of NATO.

French nuclear deterrence is independent by nature, but due to the strategic evolutions of the world, the strategic competition, and the war in Ukraine, and so on, France understands that it’s only for the benefit of everyone—including France—to further contribute to NATO nuclear deterrence and also to the protection of European countries. France came back to the military integrated command of NATO in 2008—we never left the political bodies of NATO, but Nicolas Sarkozy decided to come back to the military structures of NATO in 2008. He felt that there was a change in the strategic environment that needed France to be back in a very efficient military alliance.

With Macron’s speech in February 2020, when he said very clearly that the French vital interests have a European dimension and that he was ready to invite European countries to learn more about the French nuclear deterrent and to build together a shared strategic culture between European countries—why did he say that, and what does it mean? First, he said that because he saw the consequences of the first mandate of Donald Trump, from 2017 to 2021, with the first scare of the U.S. being less involved in the defense of Europe. It was also the consequence of Crimea’s annexation by Russia in 2014—the fact that Europe didn’t really do anything about it apart from sanctions, and it was not really efficient because we saw what it provoked in 2022 with the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He felt that the strategic environment was changing and that Europe might not be safe from external aggression. So, it was time to think collectively within Europe about common defense and strategic deterrence.

He made his speech in February 2020, and one month later, the whole of Europe and almost the whole world was in lockdown because of COVID. You can’t really talk about nuclear deterrence with your partners on Zoom. This invitation was put aside for two years, also because I don’t think it was concrete enough, and I don’t think that European countries were able to fully understand why and what Macron meant through that sentence. But we saw a new momentum for this French proposition about contributing to European defense after February 2022, when we now have a full-scale war on European territory and the U.S. support might not have been as intense as expected.

France is not there to replace the U.S. extended deterrence—first, because we can’t. We don’t have the political credibility to do it; we don’t have enough warheads to fully replace the U.S. extended deterrence. The idea is more to give an additional layer of security and additional insurance and to play on the fact that a limited intervention, for example, by Russia on Poland that would threaten Poland’s vital interests would necessarily have consequences on French vital interests because of the construction of Europe, because of the linkage between Poland and France, for example. That’s where the biggest difference lies between France not really extending deterrence but offering a possible French contribution to European defense and the U.S. deterrence—because France is directly concerned in its own existence by everything that can happen on the European continent. It’s less the case for the United States.

That’s why France developed its own independent nuclear deterrence—because we didn’t really believe in this U.S. extended deterrence. That’s why France considers itself maybe not more credible, but at least credible, to give this additional layer of insurance to willing European countries. But again, there is a difference between the U.S. and this French offer because, for the moment, there are no talks about putting French nuclear weapons outside of French territory—first, because it would be difficult regarding the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The idea is more to advance, let’s say, on the political side, trying to find at a very high level shared vital interests between, for example, France and Sweden or France and Germany, and thinking about the military translation of this political commitment—for example, participation of foreign armies in French nuclear exercises, maybe having the French Air Force nuclear raid exercises take place outside of French airspace, having many visits of foreign diplomats to the SSBN base, for example. There are plenty of ideas, but we are lacking French political guidance about it.

The role played by French nuclear deterrence for Europe has been recognized very early on. At the time of General de Gaulle, there was already this idea that the French nuclear forces, just by their position in Europe and the fact that, obviously, if France was under attack, other countries would have been invaded by the Soviet Union, we would probably not wait until the Soviet Union was at the border to actually react. After the Cold War, there was some discussion at a very high political level about the role that French nuclear forces play. There was not a lot of interest from European partners. Today, two trends are pushing the topic back a bit on the agenda. The first one is that the security situation is worsening in Europe—European partners are more inclined to see nuclear deterrence as something that can contribute to their security. The second factor is that U.S. extended deterrence can appear less reliable because of Donald Trump. It’s expected that the U.S. is not going to continue to be so active and present to defend European security but might be more willing to commit its resources to the Asia-Pacific theater. These trends have really increased the interest and the thinking here in Paris, but also elsewhere, that France is now the only nuclear power on the continent of Europe.

France has some interests outside of its borders, and if some countries were attacked massively in Europe, it would affect its vital interests. It’s not so much an extended deterrence as in NATO, but more a recognition that there are interests in the security of Europe, and therefore independent nuclear deterrence can play a role in protecting—indirectly—other European nations.

==== Expanding the Role of French Nuclear Deterrence
Our next guest reflects on recent conversations about expanding the role of French nuclear weapons beyond functioning as a national deterrent. 'I’m Livia Horowitz. I work for the SWP in Berlin, and I generally do research on nuclear policy issues and particularly on nuclear deterrence. What could be the purpose of the French nuclear arsenal for European security? Is this a complementary element in relation to the arsenal of the United States or to the security assurances that Washington offers its European allies? Or is this a replacement should the United States decide to withdraw its nuclear assurances towards Europe? Some people argue that it’s possible for France to replace the United States, but the majority argue that, given current constraints—be they in relation to France’s arsenal, but also in relation to France’s relations with its neighbors, also regarding France’s position in the European architecture—that this is not possible.

Then comes the next dimension of what we need to change, and the problem is that the dimension of change that would need to happen is simply very large. Many things would need to happen for France to be able to take on that role. Those changes are expensive, both from a financial perspective and, more importantly, from a political and strategic perspective. For those to happen, we would need to have a political imperative. Conversely, the suggestions that everybody brings to the table today are all small steps that would happen within the current architecture that is not confronted with—at least at Time Zero, at that point in time now—basically is not confronted with such large pressure that would warrant those massive changes in doctrine, in arsenal, in security approach. A lot of the proposals are very good at enhancing France’s role in European security and creating an additional or better-positioned additional pillar in European nuclear deterrence, but in no way would those steps suffice for France to replace the United States.

Why are we talking about France in the first place? Because Emmanuel Macron, a couple of years ago, held a speech in which he basically said, "You folks, come to Paris, and we’ll talk about nuclear deterrence," and nobody really understood what was on the table, what he was actually talking about. As people asked more questions, it became clear there was one educational component. France thought it could share more about how to educate its neighbors on how nuclear deterrence works and why it is so important to have nuclear deterrence. This was a couple of years ago. A lot of the countries in Europe were not very convinced in the first place that nuclear weapons were necessary. That perception has been significantly or severely altered through Russia’s war against Ukraine and the use of nuclear rhetoric by Moscow, and hence maybe that component is slightly muted.

The other component was France’s offer to get other states in Europe involved in its own nuclear exercises, in its own thinking about nuclear policy. However, that involvement is mainly geared towards creating some redundancy—not taking over parts of France’s nuclear deterrence or nuclear responsibilities, nuclear arsenal, but adding a couple of layers, potentially, as we go down the road, and at first becoming more familiar with how the French are doing nuclear deterrence. This is the starting point, and on top of this starting point, a number of both officials and experts have placed various steps that could be taken—where exactly, which kind of exercise could be attended, what kind of capabilities, who could add to the French dimension, and so on.

Then, of course, there was quite a bit of discussion, for instance, about funding French nuclear efforts. Numerous people, also in Germany, advanced the proposition, "The French need money; we have maybe a bit of money; we should do that." And then the voices responded with, "No, you don’t understand; that’s not at all what we actually meant." There was dialogue that was not exactly on the same wavelength between what the government in Paris has in mind and what various commentators actually believe to be ideal. So, those are just another slight incongruence about who wants what.

If you talk to French officials, they say, "Come to Paris, and we will talk about how nuclear deterrence should happen, how various countries should position themselves in various UN fora, also towards other pieces of nuclear diplomacy, and then we will take it further from there." Basically, "We cannot put anything on the table for as long as we don’t know where the discussion is going to take us." Conversely, if you ask officials in Berlin, they say, "Why would we come to Paris if we don’t know what you want to exactly talk about?" So, one side says, "Let’s talk, and we’ll see where the road leads us," and the other side says, "If we don’t know where you want to go, then why would we start on the road?"

A lot of people have given thoughts to how to react to Moscow’s rhetoric, and French officials have been quite purposeful about making various statements, especially at the beginning of Russia’s war against Ukraine—making not only statements as to France also being a nuclear power, another center of decision influencing Russia’s calculations, but also by taking clear measures, sending another submarine out at sea and hence signaling to Moscow that they also are playing a role. However, in the grand scheme of things, most nuclear communication throughout this crisis came from Washington, and if one is to believe what Russian officials say in public, they also seem to be significantly more concerned with Washington’s signals and Washington’s positions than they are with either London’s or Paris’s actions. But this is obviously just from watching open-source statements. How the Russians react, what kind of discussions they have behind closed doors—that nobody knows.

At the other end of the spectrum is the fundamental question of what would happen if the Americans were to rescind their nuclear assurances, basically, from Europe. In other words—and it’s worth mentioning that there is a bit of confusion, also in Germany, but also throughout the commentariat, with a lot of people believing that it is possible for the United States to say, "We’re not doing nuclear deterrence, but we’re doing other sorts of security assurances." Extended nuclear deterrence is the last, and not the first, step in Europe. Even a Trump administration bent on reducing the U.S. role in Europe would rather focus on the conventional aspects and leave nuclear deterrence as the final step before they pack up and go home.

Now, a lot of people are really worried about the fate of the transatlantic security arrangements in a Trump administration, and they are thinking about the hypothetical of ensuring European nuclear deterrence without the United States. The fundamental problem is that extended deterrence is hard. The French are pretty good at deterring an adversary from attacking France, but how credible were they to argue that they provide extended deterrence for all of Europe? There are two questions: Do the Russians believe them? And the second, and more important, question is: Do their allies believe them? Do they feel sufficiently secure under such a promise to A) not develop their own nuclear weapons, or B) not go to Moscow and strike some sort of parallel deals in order to preempt the possibility of Russian nuclear coercion? And some of these nations might not be willing to do one or the other. They might run first to Washington to see whether there is some sort of bilateral option there.

Assuming that everybody would be on the same page that France would try to do it, the question is: How credible is it? For the United States, it’s been pretty hard to reassure the Europeans. It had built a relatively large and relatively diverse nuclear arsenal and has also integrated its European partners in some form of consultative process. Most people inherently look at this example of how it’s been done in the past and think how France could adapt its posture, its forces, to fit more of that sort of arrangement. Because France has a much, much smaller and much, much less diversified nuclear arsenal, it doesn’t have any sort of institutional framework in which it would be able to integrate its allies. The road is very long. Yes, it’s possible, but it’s very expensive, very cumbersome, and basically, Paris would have to do a lot in order to achieve even a moderately similar outcome or even go in that direction.

Many people, conversely, have argued—have proposed—that less would be sufficient, and the question is: How much less? The fundamental question here is not whether you need the large arsenal, because France already has sufficient nuclear weapons to inflict unacceptable damage on the Russian Federation. If it were to inflict such unacceptable damage on the Russian Federation, Moscow could answer by also inflicting unacceptable damage on France. The question then becomes: How do you persuade your allies that you’re willing to potentially accept such tremendous cost in order to protect them, so as to deter the other side from even trying to test your resolve—to actually push you to see whether you’re actually serious about your promises?

And hence, within this framework, the solution chosen by the United States was to diversify its nuclear arsenal, to have the ability to not immediately go for countervalue—for hitting population centers, for hitting very important and crucial targets on the other side—but to use nuclear weapons in the theater, to use nuclear weapons to attack the arsenal of the other power, and hence to keep this strategic dimension of going all-in further down the road, thus increasing its own credibility that it might potentially use nuclear weapons in defense of their allies. This is just one way of doing this.

You can increase your political credibility by saying the other side is so important because we are the same country—they are not just allies that we might or might not care about, but we have a political union. So, were Europeans to create a supranational entity—basically a United States of Europe—probably a pretty small nuclear arsenal would be sufficient for everybody. Maybe even the arsenal that France and Britain together have today might be sufficient to provide overarching nuclear deterrence. Then we would have to look at the conventional aspects and what is credible to defend our borders within this situation. But we don’t have a United States of Europe.

The next question is: What else can be done beyond that nuclear dimension, beyond that large arsenal, and so on? The other question is: How do you demonstrate, if we don’t have a political union and not one state—you’re not protecting your citizens that elect the central government that they are all deserving of your protection—how do you demonstrate still that you care enough? You can do that, for instance, by deploying a lot of military personnel towards the borders that are most endangered. We’re talking here about hundreds of thousands of soldiers, and they will basically fight for those allies. They will fight a long fight, they will die, and you will then reinforce them. You will transform your economy, you will fight a conventional war for Europe—for your allies—and that conventional war might then escalate to the nuclear level, at which point it’s unquestionable that your fundamental interests are being touched, and hence you will then go to the nuclear level, and you might actually be able to escalate.

It is not impossible to do it—it’s creating that plausibility, ensuring the other nations that you’re actually willing to do it—that’s rather difficult. If we look at the political problems that France seems to have today, that seems to be a bridge that is rather hard to cross.

==== French Position on Arms Control
Emmanuel Metra concludes with thoughts on the French position on arms control. 'Regarding the future, the French vision has always been rather cautious and now is rather pessimistic about the evolution of the strategic environment. There is really a willingness to keep nuclear deterrence at the center of the defense policy. Where France maybe is a bit unique is that it’s never really considered that nuclear weapons were out of date or that they should become a less important part of our military investments. In the current context, it remains extremely central and is really highlighted as something that is absolutely necessary to deal with the return of major power competition.

France has observed the degradation of the arms control environment and has been, once again, thinking that, in the current context, strategic stability was best served by a strong deterrence posture, with this idea that arms control and deterrence are two things that go together because they can both prevent aggression and they can both avoid incentives for an adversary to start an aggression. This idea is that if we are strong and if we are credible, the opponents are not going to feel that there is a place for them to be successful in leading an aggression. This is really a message that is coming through—that strategic stability is served by a strong deterrence posture and that the immediate priority is to invest and make sure that the deterrence posture is credible and well-funded across the board in France, in NATO, and elsewhere.

The second element, I would say, goes hand in hand with efforts to work on strategic risk reduction and to look where there might be avenues to adopt some measures—at the unilateral level or at the more multilateral or any kind of levels—to see what measures would be useful to limit the risks. There have been some declarations, for instance, on keeping the human in the loop regarding nuclear decision-making, or regarding space, or regarding new technologies, and so on.

Regarding formal arms control and the possibility that we may see a follow-up of the New START treaty or INF treaty, in principle, there is support for anything that can bring transparency and avoid arms race dynamics among the major nuclear powers. There is some concern if, for instance, there are propositions coming from Russia that want to include the French and British arsenals in the count of what Western nuclear weapons are, but otherwise, if something looked credible and possible to be verified, France would probably support the initiative.

What is interesting, if we look at other Western countries, is really the fact that the French nuclear policy is so central in shaping the whole military and in shaping the investments that are being made—in determining what kind of planes are going to be bought or how many attack submarines are going to be procured. It’s really central, and we see it when we talk with people in the forces—especially, of course, the Navy and the Air Force, which are really dimensioned to be able to carry that mission. But there’s also something to be said about the fact that there’s really no contestation or debate about the continuity of nuclear deterrence in France. It doesn’t mean that there is broad support or that the population is usually dedicated to that, but there’s no debate about it. There’s really no questioning in the parliament or elsewhere.

==== Closing Remarks
Thank you for listening, and to our guests, and to the European Union’s Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Consortium for funding the series. Until next time, stay optimistic.
