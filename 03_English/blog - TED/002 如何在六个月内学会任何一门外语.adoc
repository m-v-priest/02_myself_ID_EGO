Reviewer: Allam Zedan

The people in the back,
can you hear me clearly?

OK, good.

Have you ever held a question in mind +
for so long that it becomes
part of how you think?

Maybe even part of who you are
as a person?

[.my2]
甚至可能已经成为你自己的一部分？

Well I've had a question in my mind
for many, many years +
and that is:
How can you speed (v.) up learning?

Now, this is an interesting question

because if you speed up learning, +
you can spend less time at school.

And if you learn really fast, +
you probably
wouldn't have to go to school at all.

Now, when I was young, +
school was sort of 有点,稍稍 OK but...

I found quite often that school
*got in the way 阻碍、妨碍或干扰 of* learning

[.my2]
我经常发现学校阻碍了我的学习

so I had this question in mind:
How do you learn faster?

And this began when I was
very, very young,

when I was 11 years old,

I wrote a letter to researchers in the
Soviet Union, asking about hypnopaedia,

this is sleep-learning 睡眠学习法,

where you get a _tape recorder_,
you put it beside your bed

and it *turns on*
in the middle of the night

when you're sleeping,

and you're supposed (v.)（根据所知）认为，推断，料想;（按规定、习惯、安排等）应当，应，该，须 to be
learning from this.

A good idea,
unfortunately it doesn't work.

But, hypnopaedia 睡眠教学法 did open the doors +
to research (v.)  in other areas

and we've had incredible discoveries about learning  +
后定 that began
with that first question.

[.my2]
并且我们从研究这个问题开始,
已经有了一些惊人的发现。

I *went on* from there  +
to become passionate about psychology 心理学

and I have been involved in psychology +
in many different ways +
for the rest of my life +
up until this point.

[.my2]
直到现在，我的余生都在以不同的方式研究心理学。

In 1981, I took myself to China +
and I decided that I was going to be
native level in Chinese inside two years.

Now, you need to understand that
in 1981, everybody thought Chinese was really, really difficult +
and that a Westerner could study (v.) for 10 years or more +
and never really get very good at it.

And I also went in with a different idea  +
which was: taking all of the conclusions from psychological research up to that point   +
and applying them to the learning process.

[.my2]
将心理学研究的所有结论, 应用到学习过程中。

What was really cool was that  +
in six months I was fluent in Mandarin Chinese   +
and it took _a little bit (a.)很小的 longer_ *to get up to* 到达某一点 native.

But I looked around  +
and I saw all of these people from different countries  struggling terribly with Chinese,
I saw Chinese people struggling terribly to learn English and other languages,    +
and so my question got refined 精炼，提纯 down to:  How can you help a normal adult  learn (v.) a new language quickly, easily and effectively?
Now this is a really, really important question in today's world.

[.my1]
.案例
====
.get down to something
(v.) to start to direct your efforts and attention towards something
開始認真對待;開始認真注意;開始努力做 +

- I've got a lot of work to do, but I can't seem *to get down to it*.
我有很多工作要做，可我好像就是沒法安下心來去做。
- [ + -ing verb ]  UK I must *get down to* booking the hotels.
我得開始預訂我們的旅館了。
====

We have massive 非常严重的；大量的，大规模的 challenges with environment,  we have massive challenges with social dislocation  (制度、进程、生活方式的)紊乱,  with wars, all sorts of things going on   +
and if we can't communicate （与某人）交流（信息或消息、意见等）；沟通,  we're really going to have difficulty (n.) 状 solving (v.) these problems.

So we need to be able to speak each other's languages,  this is really, really important.

The question then is: How do you do that?  Well, it's actually really easy.

You look around for people who can already do it,  you look for situations where it's already working  +
and then you identify (v.) the principles and apply them.

It's called modelling 模仿  +
and I've been looking at _language learning_  and modelling _language learning_ for about 15 to 20 years now.

[.my2]
这叫做建模(模型化)，我研究语言学习和语言学习建模已经有15到20年了。

And my conclusion, my observation from this is  that  +
any adult can learn a second language to fluency (n.) inside six months.

Now when I say this, most people think I'm crazy, this is not possible.

So let me *remind* (v.) everybody *of* the history of human progress 进步，进展,  it's all about expanding our limits.

In 1950, everybody believed that _running one mile in four minutes_ was impossible,  and then Roger Bannister did it in 1956  and from there it's got (v.) shorter and shorter.

100 years ago /everybody believed that heavy stuff doesn't fly.

Except it does /and we all know this.

How does _heavy stuff_ fly?  We reorganise (v.)重新组织；改组；整顿 the material (n.)材料；原料 using principles that we have learned  from observing nature 观察自然, birds *in this case*.

[.my1]
.案例
====
.reorganize
[ VNV] to change the way in which sth is organized or done重新组织；改组；整顿
====

And today we've gone even further...

[.my2]
我们甚至更进一步

We've gone even further, so you can fly a car.

You can buy one of these  +
for a couple 100.000 US dollars.

We now have cars in the world that fly.

And there's a different way to fly  +
which we've learned from squirrels 松鼠.

So all you need to do is copy (v.) what a _flying squirrel_ does,  build a suit called a wing suit 翼装 and *off you go* 你可以走了,你已经可以出发了, you can fly like a squirrel.

[.my1]
.案例

====

Now most people, a lot of people, I *wouldn't* say everybody  *but* a lot of people think (v.) they can't draw.

However there are some key principles, five principles, that you can apply  to learning to draw  +
and you can actually learn (v.) to draw in five days.

So, if you draw like this, you learn these principles for five days  and apply them  +
and after five days you can draw something like this.

Now I know this is true because that was my first drawing   +
and after five days of applying these principles  +
that was what I was able to do.

And I looked at this and I went:  "Wow, so that's how I look like  +
when I'm concentrating (v.)集中（注意力）；聚精会神 *so* intensely  *that* my brain is exploding."   +
So, anybody can learn (v.) to draw in five days   +
and in the same way, with the same logic,  anybody can learn a second language in six months.

[.my2]
哇！这就是我高度集中注意力的结果, 专注到我的头脑简直要爆炸了


How? There are five principles and seven actions.

There may be a few more  +
but these are absolutely core.

[.my2]
也许有更多，但这些绝对是最核心的

And before I get into those  +
I just want to talk about two myths 神话,谬见,  I want to dispel  (v.)驱散，消除（尤指感觉或信仰） two myths.

The first is that you need talent 天赋，才能.

Let me tell you about Zoe.

Zoe came from Australia, went to Holland, was trying to learn Dutch,  struggling extremely 极度，非常, extremely... a great deal 很多,大量  +
and finally people were saying: "You're completely useless,"  "you're not talented (a.)有天资的，有才能的," "give up," "you're a waste of time"  and she was very, very depressed.

And then she *came across* （偶然）遇见，碰见，发现 these five principles,  she moved to Brazil and she applied them   +
and in six months she was fluent in Portuguese 葡萄牙语,  so 所以；因此 talent doesn't matter (v.).

People also think that  +
immersion （做某事的）专心，投入；浸没，浸泡 in a new country is the way to learn a language.

But look around Hong Kong, look at all the westerners  who've been here for 10 years, who don't speak a word of Chinese.

Look at all the Chinese living in America, Britain, Australia, Canada  have been there 10, 20 years  and they don't speak any English.

Immersion _per se_ 本身，本质上 does not work.

Why? Because a drowning 溺水的 man cannot learn (v.) to swim.

When you don't speak a language, you're like a baby.

And if you drop yourself into a context  背景，环境；上下文，语境 which is all adults talking about stuff *over your head* 难以理解, you won't learn.

[.my2]
如果你把自己置身于一个所有成年人都在谈论你无法理解的事情的环境中，你是学不会东西的。

So, what are the five principles  +
that you need to *pay attention to* 注意,重视,留心?   +
First: the four words,  #attention, meaning, relevance 相关性，实用性，意义 and memory#,  and these interconnect (v.)（使类似的事物）相联系，相互联系，相互连接 in very, very important ways.

Especially when you're talking about learning.

Come with me  +
on a journey through a forest.

You go on a walk (n.) through a forest   +
and you see something like this... Little marks 标记，记号 on a tree,  maybe you pay attention, maybe you don't.

You go another 50 metres and you see this...

You should be 应该 paying attention.

Another 50 metres, if you haven't been paying attention, you see this...

And at this point, you're paying attention.

And you've just learned that this... is important,  it's relevant (a.)紧密相关的；切题的;有价值的；有意义的 because it means (v.) this,   +
and anything that is related,  +
`主` any information *related 涉及；与…相关；谈到 to* your survival 存活  `系`  is stuff  +
后定 that you're going *to pay attention to*   +
and therefore you're going to remember it.

If it's related to your personal goals,  then you're going to pay attention to it.

If it's relevant, you're going to remember it.

So, the first rule, first principle for learning a language   +
is *focus on* _language content_ that is relevant to you.

Which *brings* us *to* tools.

We master (v.)精通，掌握；控制 tools by using tools  +
and we learn (v.) tools the fastest  when they are relevant to us.

So let me share a story.

A keyboard is a tool.

Typing (v.)Chinese a certain way, there are methods for this. That's a tool.

[.my2]
用某种方式输入中文，有很多方法。这些都只是一个工具。

I had a colleague many years ago   +
who went to night school;   +
Tuesday night, Thursday night,  two hours each time, practicing (v.)练习，训练 at home,  she spent nine months, and she did not learn to type (v.) Chinese.

And one night we had a crisis 危机，紧要关头；决定性时刻，关键时刻.

We had 48 hours to deliver (v.)投递，运送 _a training manual_ in Chinese.

[.my2]
我们有48小时的时间, 来提供中文版的培训手册。

And she got the job, and I can guarantee 确保，保证；担保 you  in 48 hours, she learned to type (v.) Chinese  because it was relevant (a.), it was meaningful, it was important,  she was using a tool to create value.

So the second principle for learning a language is  +
to use your language  as a tool to communicate (v.) +
right from day one.

[.my2]
从第一天起, 就把它当成一个沟通的工具

As a kid does.

When I first arrived in China, I didn't speak a word of Chinese,  and on my second week, I got to take a train ride (n.)（乘车或骑车的）短途旅程 overnight.

I spent eight hours  +
sitting in the dining car 餐车  +
talking to one of the guards on the train,   +
he *took an interest in me* for some reason,  and we just chatted all night in Chinese   +
and he was drawing pictures  +
and making movements 动作 with his hands  and facial expressions 面部表情  +
and *piece by piece by piece* 逐件地,逐步地，一点一点地  I understood more and more.

But `主` what was really cool, `系` was two weeks later,  when people were talking Chinese around me,  I was understanding some of this   +
and I hadn't even made any effort to learn (v.) that.

What had happened, I'd absorbed it /that night on the train,  which brings us to the third principle.

When you first understand the message,  then you will acquire (v.) the language unconsciously.

And this *is* really, really well *documented* (v.)记录，记载（详情）;用文件证明（或证实） now,  it's something called _comprehensible input_ 可理解输入.

There's 20 or 30 years of research on this,  Stephen Krashen, a leader in the field,   +
has published (v.) all sorts of these different studies   +
and this is just *from one of them*.

[.my2]
Stephen Krashen，这个领域的领导者，发表了各种不同的研究，这只是其中的一个。

The purple bars `谓` show (v.) the scores on different tests for language.

[.my2]
紫色的条形图, 显示了不同语言测试的分数。

The purple people were people  +
who had learned by grammar and formal study,   +
the green ones are the ones  +
who learned by _comprehensible input_.

So, comprehension works (v.).  +
Comprehension （语言学习中的）理解练习（或训练） is key   +
and language learning `系` is not about accumulating (v.)积累 lots of knowledge.

[.my2]
#理解是关键，学习语言不是为了积累大量的知识。#

In many, many ways  +
it's about physiological training 生理训练.

A woman I know from Taiwan `谓` did great in English at school,   +
she got A grades **all the way through** 从头到尾，自始至终,  went through 经历、经受,或完成某事 college, A grades,  +
went to the US  and found she couldn't understand what people were saying.

And people started asking her: "Are you deaf 聋的?"  And she was. English deaf.

Because we have filters (n.) in our brain  +
that *filter (v.)过滤 in*  the sounds that we are familiar with   +
and they *filter out* 过滤掉 _the sounds of languages_ that we're not.

And if you can't hear it, you won't understand it,  if you can't understand it, you're not going to learn it.

[.my2]
如果你听不到，你就听不懂，如果你听不懂，你就学不会。(所以英语练听力, 是第一位的)

So you actually have to be able to hear these sounds.

And there are ways to do that  +
but it's physiological training.

[.my2]
这是有办法的，但这是生理训练


Speaking takes (v.) muscle.

[.my2]
说话会用到肌肉

You've got 43 muscles in your face,  you have to coordinate  (v.)协调，配合；使身体协调 those in a way   +
that you make sounds 后定 that other people will understand.

If you've ever done a new sport for a couple of days,  and you know _how your body feels_? Hurts?  If your face is hurting, you're doing it right.

And the final principle `系` is state (n.)状态，状况. Psycho-physiological 心理生理的 state.

If you're sad, angry, worried, upset, you're not going to learn. Period.

[.my2]
如果你很难过、生气、沮丧，你是没有办法学习的

If you're happy, relaxed, in an Alpha brain state, curious,  you're going to learn really quickly,   +
and very specifically 明确地；具体地;具体来说；确切地说 you need to be tolerant (a.)宽容的，容忍的 of ambiguity 模棱两可；不明确.

[.my2]
#你就能学得很快, 特别是你必须要能容忍一些理解上的模糊#

If you're one of those people  +
who needs to understand (v.) 100 percent  every word you're hearing, +
you will go nuts (a.)发疯的，发狂的,   +
because you'll be incredibly upset  (a.)难过；不高兴；失望；沮丧 all the time, because you're not perfect.

[.my2]
#如果你是那种需要百分百理解你所听到的每一个单词的人，你会发疯的，因为你会一直感到难以置信的沮丧，因为你并不完美。 (即要像婴儿一样的学语言, 不要对每一个单词的精确意思吹毛求疵)#

If you'*re comfortable with* getting some, not getting some,  just *paying attention to* what you do understand,  you're going to be fine, relaxed, and you'll be learning quickly.

[.my2]
#如果你能自在舒服地了解一部分、不懂一部分，只关注你理解的部分，你就会很好，很放松，而且你会学得很快。#

So based on those five principles, what are _the seven actions_ that you take?  Number one: Listen a lot.

[.my2]
所以基于这五个原则，
哪七个行动是你要做的？
#第一：大量的听#

I call it _brain soaking_ 浸泡，湿透；浸入（水中，或其他液体）.

You put yourself in a context   +
where you're hearing *tons 吨；大量；许多 and tons and tons of* a language   +
and it doesn't matter if you understand it or not.

You're *listening to* _the rhythms_ 节奏；韵律, *to* _patterns_ that repeat,  you'*re listening to* _things_ that stand out.

你在听一个节奏、一个重复的韵律, 你在听那跳出来的东西

(Chinese) Pào nǎozi.

(English) So, just soak your brain in this.

The second action is that  +
you get the meaning first,  even before you get the words.

[.my2]
#第二个行动：先掌握整句句子的语意、再了解字义#

You go: "Well how do I do that? I don't know the words!"  Well, you understand what these different postures （坐立的）姿势 mean.

[.my2]
你说：这要怎么做？
我根本不认识这些字！
你了解这些不同的手势代表什么

Human communication is _body language_ in many, many ways, *so much* body language.

[.my2]
人类的沟通是各种的肢体语言，
有太多的肢体语言

From _body language_ you can understand a lot of communication,  therefore, you're understanding, you're acquiring (v.) through _comprehensible input_.

[.my2]
你就能用"可理解式输入"的方式来学习了

And you can also use (v.) patterns 样板,范例;模式；方式 that you already know.

If you're a Chinese speaker of Mandarin and Cantonese  +
and you go to Vietnam,   +
you will understand 60 percent of what they say (v.) to you in daily conversation,  because Vietnamese is about 30 percent Mandarin, 30 percent Cantonese.

The third action: Start mixing 开始混合.

[.my2]
#第三个行动：将你学过的说话方式句型, 重新组合#

You probably *have* never *thought of* this   +
but if you've got 10 verbs, 10 nouns and 10 adjectives,  you can say 1000 different things.

[.my2]
#你可能从来没这样想过, 不过如果你有10个动词、10个名词和10个形容词, 你就能说1000种不同的东西.#

Language is a creative process.

[.my2]
语言是一个创造性的过程

What do babies do? OK, "me", "bath", "now".

OK, that's how they communicate.

So *start (v.) mixing*, get creative, have fun with it,  it doesn't have to be perfect, just has to work.

[.my2]
不需要追求完美，只要有效

And when you're doing this, you *focus on* the core.

What does that mean?  Well, any language is high frequency content.

[.my2]
任何语言都有常见的内容

In English 1000 words covers 85 percent  of anything 后定 you're ever going to say in daily communication.

3000 words gives you 98 percent  of anything you're going to say in daily conversation.

You got 3000 words, you're speaking the language.

The rest 剩余部分 is *icing 糖霜（用以装饰糕饼等） on the cake* 锦上添花.

[.my1]
.案例
====
.THE ICING ON THE ˈCAKE / THE FROSTING ON THE ˈCAKE
( US also) something extra and not essential that is added to an already good situation or experience and that makes it even better锦上添花
====

[.my2]
掌握3000单词你就能说那种语言了,
剩下的不过是锦上添花

And when you're just beginning with a new language,  start with your tool box 工具箱.  +
Week _number one_,  in your new language you say things like:  "How do you say that?" "I don't understand,"  "repeat that please," "what does that mean?"  all in your target language.

[.my2]
即先从最简短, 最简单的常用话语说起, 一步步增加你的语句长度.

You're using it as a tool, making it useful to you,  it's relevant to learn other things about the language.

By week two, you should be saying things like:  "me," "this," "you," "that," "give," you know, "hot,"  simple pronouns 代词, simple nouns, simple verbs,  simple adjectives, communicating like a baby.

And by the third or fourth week, you're getting into "glue words 胶水词."  "Although," "but," "therefore," these are logical transformers 转换器  that *tie* (v.) bits of a language *together*, allowing you to make more complex meaning.

[.my2]
你要学会我称之为胶水字词（衔接词）的东西: ＂虽然＂、＂但是＂、＂因此＂. 这些逻辑性的转接, 将一些语言衔接在一起，让你能表达更复杂的意思.

At that point you're talking.

[.my2]
到那一步，你已经在”说话“了

And when you're doing that, you should get yourself a language parent.

[.my2]
当你到达那一步的时候，你该去找个语言长辈

If you look at how children and parents interact (v.)相互交流，互动,  you'll understand what this means.

When a child is speaking, it'll be using simple words, simple combinations 结合；联合；混合,   +
sometimes quite strange, sometimes very strange pronunciation,   +
`主` other people from outside the family `谓` don't understand it.

But the parents do.

And so  /
the kid has a safe environment, gets confidence.

The parents talk to the children with body language  and with simple language they know the child understands.

So you have a _comprehensible input_ environment that's safe,  we know it works (v.);  +
otherwise none of you would speak (v.) your mother tongue.

So you get yourself a language parent,  who's somebody 后定 *interested in you* as a person   +
who will communicate with you essentially 本质上，根本上；大体上，基本上 as an equal 平等的；同等的,   +
but *pay attention to* help (v.) you understand the message.

[.my2]
所以你给自己找一个语言父母，他是一个对你感兴趣的人，他会和你平等地交流，但要注意帮助你理解信息。

There are four rules of a language parent.

[.my2]
语言长辈有下列四项规则

Spouses 配偶,夫妻 are not very good at this, OK?

[.my2]
配偶通常都不擅长这些

But the four rules are,  first of all, they will work hard to understand (v.) what you mean   +
even when you're *way off* 相差甚远,错得厉害 beat 主节奏，节拍.

[.my1]
.案例
====
.way-off =  far-off
- Your explanation is way off.
“你的解释完全错误”。
====


Secondly, they will never correct (v.) your mistakes.

Thirdly, they will *feed back* their understanding of what you are saying   +
so that you can respond appropriately 适当地，恰当地 and get that feedback   +
and then they will use (v.) words that you know.

[.my2]
他们会回馈他们对你说的话的理解,
让你可以适切地回应并得到反馈,
然后他们会使用你所懂的单字

The sixth thing you have to do, is copy the face 模仿面部肌肉表情.

You got to get the muscles working (v.) right,   +
so you can sound (v.) in a way that people will understand you.

There's a couple of things you do.

One is that you hear (v.) how it feels, and feel (v.) how it sounds   +
which means you have a feedback loop 反馈回路 后定 operating in your face,   +
but ideally if you can *look at* a native speaker   +
and just observe (v.) how they use their face,   +
let your _unconscious mind_ absorb (v.) the rules,  then you're going to be able to pick it up 学会，掌握.

[.my2]
一个是去听它的感觉，然后感觉它如何发音

And if you can't get a native speaker to look at, you can use stuff like this...

[.my2]
如果你没有办法找到一个母语人士来观察, 你可以用像这样的东西

(Female voice) Sing, song, king, stung, hung.

(Chris Lonsdale) And the final idea here, the final action you need to take is something  +
that I call "direct connect".

What does this mean?  +
Well most people learning a second language  `谓` sort of *take* the _mother tongue_ (舌头;说话方式)母语；本国语言 words *and* the target words  +
and *go over* 反复研究；仔细琢磨 them  again and again in their mind  +
to try and remember them.  +
Really inefficient 效率低的，能力差的，浪费的.

大多数学习第二语言的人, 都会把母语单词(中文)和目标单词(英文), 一遍又一遍地在脑海中复习，试图记住它们。真的效率低下。

What you need to do is realise (v.)认识到，明白 that   +
everything you know `系` is an image inside your mind, it's feelings,   +
if you talk about fire, you can smell the smoke,  you can hear the crackling 发出劈啪声;（一连串的）爆裂声, you can see the flames,   +
so `主` what you do, `系` is you go into that imagery 形象的描述；意象 and all of that memory   +
and you come out with another pathway.  +
So I call it "same box, different path".

[.my2]
然后你从另一条路出来, 所以我称它为「相同框架、不同出路」

You come out of that pathway  +
and you build it *over time* 随着时间的推移,   +
you become more and more skilled  at  just *connecting* (v.) the new sounds  *to* those images  that you already have, *into* that internal representation 表现；描述；描绘；表现形式.

[.my2]
你会越来越熟练地把新的声音和你已经拥有的那些图像联系起来，进入到你内心的描述中。

And *over time*  +
you even *become* naturally *good at* that process,  that becomes unconscious.

So, there are five principles that you need to work with, seven actions,  if you do any of them, you're going to improve.

And remember these are things under your control as the learner.

[.my2]
务必记得，这是你作为一个学习者所能掌握的

Do them all /and you're going to be fluent in a second language in six months.

Thank you.

(Applause)
