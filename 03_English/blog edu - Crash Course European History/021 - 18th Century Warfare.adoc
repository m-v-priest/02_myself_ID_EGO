== 释义

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

Last time, we looked at how the monarchs did -- and didn't -- incorporate 合并；融入 the ideas of the Enlightenment into their domestic 国内的 policies.

Today, we'll look outward to how the 18th century European powers engaged with 与…打交道 each other and beyond Europe -- which is to say that warfare 战争 is coming.

Or, continuing, I suppose, because it never really left town.

[Intro]

So, population was rising in 18th century Europe, and despite 尽管 an extremely uneven 不均衡的 distribution 分配 of wealth and lots of wartime casualties 伤亡人员, many people were leading better lives.

For example, inventories 清单 of French people's possessions 财产 show that in 1700 women owned an average of two garments 衣服 generally in solid black or brown; in 1800 that number was five garments of more varied 多样的, even bright colors.

Now, this may seem like minor 较小的；次要的 progress, but here's another way of thinking about it: The average number of garments owned by people living in France rose by more in a hundred years than it had in the previous hundred thousand.

By the way, did that dress look gold to you, or blue?

And do you even remember that meme 网络流行语？

Probably not.

Oh god, I'm so old.

I grow old, I grow old, I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.

That's an even older meme.

At any rate 无论如何, we associate 把…联系在一起 these and many other improving conditions in Europe with what is called "modernity" 现代性 -- an idea combining improvement and novelty 新奇；新颖 that we will examine later in the series.

But when it came to warfare, Europeans were still battling it out 一决胜负 among themselves on the continent and on the seas -- and always at great cost.

The 18th century opened with wars of the Spanish, Polish, and Austrian successions 继承, all of which were just what their names suggest: fights over who was going to become king or queen amidst 在…当中 a dispute 争端 over rulership 统治权 -- disputes not unlike the one at the heart of the Hundred Years War.

And so in that sense, progress had been . . . minimal 极少的；微不足道的.

As far as wars between states, the dominant 占主导地位的 idea in foreign relations 外交关系 was still to grab as much territory 领土 as possible from foreign kingdoms.

Because only by making your kingdom bigger could you also make it richer.

So for instance, as Austria fought with itself during its war of succession over whether a woman, Maria Theresa, should be allowed to ascend to 登上 the Habsburg throne 王位, Frederick the Great of neighboring Prussia quickly mobilized 调动；动员 his army and seized 夺取 Silesia from the Habsburgs.

When I read the phrase, "seized Silesia," it rolled right off the tongue of my mind, but man.

Saying it is a completely different matter.

At any rate, Maria Theresa's rulership survived, but Habsburg control of Silesia did not.

Because of economic globalization 全球化, still other wars aimed at 旨在 controlling trade routes 贸易路线 and productive territory around the world.

For that reason, sometimes a cluster 群；簇 of wars in the middle of the eighteenth century has been called a "world war" or the Great War for Empire.

Like, it was a world war, but unfortunately we already have a World War I, so we're in a bit of a tight spot 处境困难, name-wise.

But these wars did occur across truly global battlefields 战场 and oceans.

They included wars between the British and local Native American peoples (sometimes called the first and second Anglo-Indian Wars), and also the French and Indian War in North America.

And there was also the Seven Years War, which was fought partly within Europe, but there were also battles between Britain and its rivals 对手 -- most notably 尤其 France and Spain -- in the Caribbean, the Philippines, and India.

In this complicated and many-tentacled 触角众多的；错综复杂的 set of wars -- or arguably 可以说 a single war in many different theaters 战区 -- the French and British were ultimately 最终地 fighting over who would be the dominant European force in the wider world.

Spain was a somewhat smaller player, fighting to protect its holdings 财产；领地 in the Caribbean and the Philippines.

Native people around the world were enlisted in 征募；征召 these struggles, and local peoples changed sides often as their interests shifted 改变, and in the end trusted none of the Europeans, who pitted 使对立 native peoples against each other and also were not known for keeping their promises.

Simultaneously 同时地, the Russians were waging war 发动战争 against the Ottomans in eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and the Caucasus.

In Russia, like in the other European kingdoms, the wars' costs were passed on 转嫁 mostly to ordinary people, who faced more efficient and demanding tax collection.

Additionally 此外, central governments were disrupting 扰乱 local traditions and practices -- for instance, local traditions related to the consumption of alcohol were disrupted in Russia by HUGE increases in taxes on alcohol.

Did the center of the world just open?

Is my favorite book, The Bear and the Dragon in there?

Ah, The Bear and the Dragon by Tom Clancy.

I've never actually read it, but inside my copy of The Bear and the Dragon is this.

So in 18th century Russia, this huge tax on alcohol eventually funded 为…提供资金 22% of the empire's total budget.

And there were other disruptions as well, arguably more important ones, including the conversion 转变 of some free peasants 农民 into serfs 农奴.

Local people fought back in a variety of ways.

The first of the extensive 广泛的 uprisings 起义 against the efficient and "enlightened" taxation to pay for warfare was the Pugachev Rebellion.

It was led by former Cossack 哥萨克人 and Russian army deserter 逃兵 Emile Pugachev.

He managed to persuade 说服 rural Russians that he was in fact Peter III, husband of Catherine II.

Now, Peter had been assassinated 暗杀 in 1762 within months of his accession to 登上 power, most likely at Catherine's command (and possibly by her lover).

So given that Russian history really was playing out like a soap opera 肥皂剧, it didn't seem impossible that the murdered Czar 沙皇 had been hiding out 躲藏 all along as a Russian army deserter named Emile.

Pugachev claimed to have wandered poor and alone like Jesus until he could become the "Tsar Redeemer 救世主."

And as Peter III, Pugachev created quite the following.

He had Russian clergy 神职人员 and officials -- both high and low -- issue 发布 a series of measures relieving 减轻 serfs of their burdens.

Pugachev also roused 激起 the Cossacks, who were fearful of being forced into the army and losing their freedom.

He confirmed 确认 their rights and liberties, and he granted 授予 everyone permission to sport 蓄留 beards, which, as you may recall, Peter I had outlawed 取缔；禁止.

And some three million Russians followed Pugachev until he was captured in 1774, then gruesomely 可怕地 tortured and executed 处决 in January 1775.

After that, Catherine again tightened 加强 the nobility's grip 控制 on serfs.

Hard on the heels of 紧接着 Pugachev's uprising, the American Revolution erupted 爆发 over a series of taxes Britain imposed on 对…征税 its thirteen colonies 殖民地 in North America -- again to pay the costs of imperial warfare.

Now, the British government felt that the expense it had incurred 招致 in defeating the French and Native Americans in the French and Indian War should be paid by the colonists who'd profited from the protection.

But in America, we don't stand for 容忍 that kind of reasoning!

There were some other things going on.

The royal government had also closed off 封锁 westward expansion at the Allegheny Mountains, which in effect 实际上 eradicated 根除 the property rights of people like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington who claimed land there.

And King George agreed with his advisors that the Americans were rough, stupid, and ineffective, especially as military people.

So to keep the Native Americans under control, a standing army 常备军 of British soldiers should be stationed 驻扎 on the North American continent and financed by 由…提供资金 the colonists.

So if history is all about shifting perspectives 视角, we're gonna shift perspectives quickly here.

From the British perspective, American colonists were taxed 1 shilling 先令 for every 26 paid by a homeland Briton, and that seemed like a pretty good deal.

But from the perspective of the North American colonists, they did not have the rights of other Englishmen, including the right not to be taxed without representation 代表权.

Colonists created a Declaration of Independence 独立宣言, which was issued in 1776.

The British then sent additional troops, and soon war erupted.

Those who wanted independence harassed 骚扰, beat up 殴打, murdered, and destroyed the property of the loyalists 效忠派, who responded in kind 以同样的方式.

The rebels 反叛者 were greatly aided by the Spanish and French who sent decisive 决定性的 aid in the form of ships and military personnel 军事人员.

And besides, the British had other concerns, including preserving 保留 their far more lucrative 赚钱的 sugar islands in the Caribbean, as well as their holdings in India, and in Canada.

Although comparatively 相对地 insignificant 无足轻重的 at the time, the newly independent colonies that became the United States established a representative 代议制的 form of government with a written constitution 宪法 that featured 以…为特色 many Enlightenment principles 原则.

Now, it was hardly a true democracy 民主国家, as only a minority 少数 had any legal say 发言权 or rights, and the Constitution itself enshrined 把…奉为神圣；体现 slavery.

But it also definitely wasn't a monarchy 君主制国家.

Anyway, this little country would eventually grow big enough for us to make an entire Crash Course about it.

Meanwhile, the defeated loyalists, including slaves who had been promised their freedom in return for 作为…的回报 fighting for the crown 王室, fled to Canada and other parts of the world.

And for the record 郑重声明, they rarely received the financial support that the British had promised them for their faithful 忠诚的 assistance.

Spain also saw uprisings against the reforms of the enlightened monarchs, though grievances 不满；抱怨 had been piling up 积累 even before efficient and tax-heavy policies were put in place.

Also, Spain lost Manila in the Philippines to the British, and they lost Florida, which, you know, not exactly a tragedy.

I am a Floridian, so I am allowed to make that joke.

And, that's not fair.

Florida is lovely.

It really is the best place in the United States to run from your past mistakes, straight into new ones.

But back to Spain.

So, across the occupied Spanish lands in the Western Hemisphere, local people found ways to express their discontent 不满 with colonial oppression 压迫, at times violently protesting injustices by imperial officials or overbearing 专横的 behavior by priests.

Religious activists 活动家 claimed that the Spanish were false gods; in the former Incan lands, several Incans actively opposed the Spanish government in a concerted 协同的 uprising that began in 1742, but was soon defeated.

Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

1. In 1780, another uprising battling Spanish rule broke out 爆发 in the Andes.
2. Inca Tupac Amaru led a powerful rebellion 反抗 against Spanish authorities in an attempt to restore 恢复 the former Incan empire
3. and to liberate 解放 local people from the increased Spanish demands for labor and taxes.
4. His wife Michaela Bastidas, who was part Incan,
5. was operational manager 运营经理 and chief enforcer 首席执行者 of loyalty to her husband's uprising.
6. In that role she was especially brutal 残忍的.
7. She threatened 威胁 slackers 偷懒的人, even her husband, whom she chastised 斥责 for following losing strategies.
8. And she ensured that the revolt's soldiers were supplied with 供应 arms and food and that they were paid
9. -- concerns that Tupac Amaru seemed to forget sometimes.
10. Alongside Bastidas, who mostly directed military activity,
11. entire units of women soldiers took to the battlefields in several parts of the empire, building on 以…为基础 traditions of active resistance 抵抗.
12. Spanish soldiers noticed them for their intense 强烈的 commitment to victory in battle,
13. calling them "supermasculine" and one fighter in particular "as bloody a butcher as her brother."
14. The rebellion was put down 镇压 with focused determination, and its leaders were eventually captured.
15. In 1781, the Spanish colonial government (in present-day Peru) had Michaela Bastidas dragged bound hand and foot to her execution, garroted 绞死, then hanged;
16. finally they cut her body to pieces with her head posted on a pike 长矛 for all to see.
17. Which, unfortunately, is not the last time we're going to be talking about heads on pikes in Crash Course European History.
18. Her husband's execution and mutilation  mutilation 肢解 followed shortly thereafter.

Thanks, Thought Bubble.

Some 100,000 people died in the uprisings in the Spanish empire -- that is, around ten percent of the native population in all of Spain's South American holdings.

The Spanish imperial government prevailed 获胜 whereas the British did not for a number of reasons.

For one, the Spanish administration 管理；行政机构 was less dispersed 分散的 in its efforts and had seen how Britain suffered because it was fighting all around the world.

Also, Spain had also begun the process of integrating 使融入 creoles 克里奥尔人 -- people of Spanish descent 后裔 born in the colonies -- into the officer corps 军官团 of the Spanish imperial armies.

Professional training, access to military schools, and military privileges 特权 all served to build loyalty to Spain.

And that was essentially the opposite of British treatment and attitudes towards North American colonials.

Britain saw its North American colonials as, like, useless at fighting and hopeless as officers.

And so the Spanish Empire in the Americas survived for now.

Still, some saw a different outcome.

Francisco de Miranda, a creole official in the Spanish army, helped achieve the victory for the American Revolutionaries at Yorktown.

He watched the Spanish dealings with the rebels in Peru, observing "how astute 精明的 and perfidious 背信弃义的 the Spanish agents had proved. . . ."

But Miranda predicted, "the Anglo-American colonies. . . independence. . . was bound to be . . . the infallible 绝对可靠的 preliminary to our own."

And indeed, people of South America had greater battles to come as they continued to fight for their freedom from Spain.

So, these eighteenth century wars had many long-term outcomes.

First, as the Seven Years War unwound 结束 and the Prussian army built itself up, Frederick the Great saw a chance to cut up 瓜分 Poland-Lithuania, proposing to divide a good chunk of it among Austria, Russia, and Prussia itself.

This was the First Partition of Poland; so-called because further partitions 瓜分 would follow.

Meanwhile, while Britain lost what it thought of as a less lucrative part of its empire, it kept its domination 统治 of the Caribbean sugar islands and turned its attention to extracting 提取；获取 the wealth of India.

Finally, after providing the crucial 关键的 aid that allowed the birth of the United States of America, France was in dire 极其严重的 financial straits 困境 and badly in need of reform.

As the French watched, and supported, the emergence of a nation without a monarch across the Atlantic, few of them could have imagined that a great revolution was just one episode away that would see the French monarchy beheaded -- both literally 照字面意义地 and figuratively 象征性地.

Thanks for watching.

I'll see you then.

大家好，我是约翰·格林，这里是《速成欧洲史》。

上一次，我们探讨了君主们是如何——以及如何没有——将启蒙运动的思想融入到他们的国内政策之中的。

今天，我们将把目光投向外部，看看18世纪的欧洲列强之间是如何互动的，以及它们与欧洲以外地区的互动情况——也就是说，战争即将来临。

或者，我想应该说是战争仍在继续，因为战争其实从未真正远离。

[开场介绍]

在18世纪的欧洲，人口在不断增长。尽管财富分配极不均衡，而且战争造成了大量的人员伤亡，但许多人的生活还是变得更好了。

例如，对法国人财产的清查显示，在1700年，女性平均拥有两件衣服，通常是纯黑色或棕色的；到了1800年，这个数字变成了五件，而且颜色更加多样，甚至有鲜艳的颜色。

现在，这可能看起来只是小小的进步，但我们可以换个角度来看待它：在法国，人们平均拥有的衣服数量在一百年内的增长幅度，比此前十万年的增长幅度还要大。

顺便问一下，那件裙子在你看来是金色的，还是蓝色的？

你还记得那个网络梗吗？

可能不记得了。

哦，天哪，我太老了。

我变老了，我变老了，我将卷起我的裤脚。

这是一个更古老的梗了。

无论如何，我们把欧洲的这些以及许多其他不断改善的情况，与所谓的“现代性”联系在一起——这是一个将进步与创新相结合的概念，我们将在本系列课程的后续内容中对此进行探讨。

但在战争方面，欧洲人仍然在欧洲大陆和海洋上相互争斗——而且总是付出巨大的代价。

18世纪伊始，就爆发了西班牙王位继承战争、波兰王位继承战争和奥地利王位继承战争，这些战争正如其名所示：都是在关于统治权的争端中，为了争夺谁将成为国王或女王而进行的战斗——这些争端与百年战争（Hundred Years War）的核心争端并无不同。

所以从这个意义上说，进步……微乎其微。

就国家间的战争而言，外交关系中的主导思想仍然是尽可能从外国夺取更多的领土。

因为只有让你的王国变得更大，你才能让它变得更富有。

例如，当奥地利在其王位继承战争中，就女性玛丽亚·特蕾西亚（Maria Theresa）是否应该被允许登上哈布斯堡（Habsburg）王位而陷入内斗时，邻国普鲁士（Prussia）的腓特烈大帝（Frederick the Great）迅速调动军队，从哈布斯堡家族手中夺取了西里西亚（Silesia）。

当我读到“夺取西里西亚”这个短语时，它在我脑海中脱口而出，但天哪。

真正说出来可完全是另一回事。

无论如何，玛丽亚·特蕾西亚的统治得以延续，但哈布斯堡家族对西里西亚的控制却不复存在了。

由于经济全球化，还有其他一些战争旨在控制世界各地的贸易路线和富饶的领土。

出于这个原因，18世纪中期的一系列战争有时被称为“世界大战”或“帝国大战争”。

虽然这是一场世界大战，但不幸的是，我们已经有了第一次世界大战（World War I），所以从名称上来说，我们有点陷入了困境。

但这些战争确实发生在真正的全球战场和海洋上。

它们包括英国（British）与当地美洲原住民（Native American）之间的战争（有时被称为第一次和第二次英印战争），以及北美（North America）的法国印第安人战争（French and Indian War）。

还有七年战争（Seven Years War），这场战争部分发生在欧洲境内，但也有英国与其对手——最主要的是法国（France）和西班牙（Spain）——在加勒比地区（Caribbean）、菲律宾（Philippines）和印度（India）的战斗。

在这一系列复杂且涉及范围广泛的战争中——或者可以说这是一场在许多不同战区进行的单一战争——法国和英国最终是在争夺谁将成为更广阔世界中的主导欧洲势力。

西班牙的作用相对较小，它在为保护其在加勒比地区和菲律宾的领地而战。

世界各地的原住民被卷入了这些争斗中，当地人民常常随着自身利益的变化而改变立场，最终他们对欧洲人都不信任，因为欧洲人让原住民相互对抗，而且也不以信守承诺而著称。

与此同时，俄罗斯（Russia）人在东欧（eastern Europe）、地中海（Mediterranean）、中东（Middle East）和高加索地区（Caucasus）与奥斯曼人（Ottomans）交战。

在俄罗斯，和其他欧洲王国一样，战争的代价大多转嫁给了普通人，他们面临着更高效、更严苛的税收征收。

此外，中央政府正在扰乱当地的传统和习俗——例如，俄罗斯对酒类大幅增税，扰乱了当地与酒类消费相关的传统。

世界的中心是不是刚刚打开了？

我最喜欢的书《熊与龙》（The Bear and the Dragon）在里面吗？

啊，汤姆·克兰西（Tom Clancy）写的《熊与龙》。

实际上我从来没有读过这本书，但在我的这本《熊与龙》里面有这个。

所以在18世纪的俄罗斯，对酒类的高额税收最终为帝国的总预算贡献了22% 。

而且还有其他的扰乱因素，或许是更重要的因素，包括一些自由农民沦为农奴。

当地人以各种方式进行了反抗。

第一次大规模反抗为战争支付的高效且“开明”税收的起义是普加乔夫起义（Pugachev Rebellion）。

它是由前哥萨克（Cossack）和俄罗斯军队逃兵叶梅利扬·普加乔夫（Emile Pugachev）领导的。

他设法让俄罗斯的农民相信，他实际上是叶卡捷琳娜二世（Catherine II）的丈夫彼得三世（Peter III）。

彼得三世在1762年即位几个月后就被暗杀了，很可能是奉叶卡捷琳娜的命令（也可能是她的情人所为）。

所以鉴于俄罗斯的历史真的就像一部肥皂剧一样，这位被谋杀的沙皇一直以一个名叫叶梅利扬的俄罗斯军队逃兵的身份藏身，这似乎也并非不可能。

普加乔夫声称自己曾像耶稣一样穷困潦倒地流浪，直到他能成为“沙皇救世主”。

作为彼得三世，普加乔夫吸引了相当多的追随者。

他让俄罗斯的神职人员和官员——无论高低——发布了一系列减轻农奴负担的措施。

普加乔夫还煽动了哥萨克人，他们担心被强迫征入军队并失去自由。

他确认了他们的权利和自由，并且他允许每个人留胡子，你们可能还记得，彼得一世（Peter I）曾禁止留胡子。

大约有三百万俄罗斯人追随普加乔夫，直到他在1774年被捕，然后在1775年1月被残忍地折磨并处决。

在那之后，叶卡捷琳娜再次加强了贵族对农奴的控制。

紧随普加乔夫起义之后，美国独立战争（American Revolution）爆发了，原因是英国对其在北美的十三个殖民地（thirteen colonies）征收了一系列税收——同样是为了支付帝国战争的费用。

当时，英国政府认为，它在法国印第安人战争中击败法国人和美洲原住民所产生的费用，应该由从这种保护中获益的殖民者来承担。

但在美国，我们可不接受这种理由！

还有其他一些事情也在发生。

皇家政府还禁止在阿勒格尼山脉（Allegheny Mountains）以西进行扩张，这实际上剥夺了像托马斯·杰斐逊（Thomas Jefferson）和乔治·华盛顿（George Washington）这样在那里宣称拥有土地的人的财产权。

而且乔治国王（King George）同意他的顾问们的看法，认为美国人粗鲁、愚蠢且无能，尤其是在军事方面。

所以为了控制美洲原住民，应该在北美大陆驻扎一支英国常备军，费用由殖民者承担。

所以如果历史就是关于视角的转变，那我们现在就快速转换一下视角。

从英国的角度来看，北美殖民者每缴纳26先令的税，英国本土的人只需要缴纳1先令，这似乎是一笔很划算的交易。

但从北美殖民者的角度来看，他们没有其他英国公民所拥有的权利，包括没有代表权就不纳税的权利。

殖民者在1776年发表了《独立宣言》（Declaration of Independence）。

然后英国派遣了更多的军队，很快战争就爆发了。

那些想要独立的人骚扰、殴打、谋杀保皇派，并破坏他们的财产，保皇派也以牙还牙。

西班牙和法国给予了反叛者决定性的援助，包括派遣船只和军事人员，这对反叛者帮助很大。

此外，英国还有其他的顾虑，包括保住他们在加勒比地区利润丰厚的产糖岛屿，以及他们在印度和加拿大（Canada）的领地。

尽管当时新独立的殖民地——后来成为了美国（United States）——相对来说并不起眼，但它建立了一种代议制政府形式，并制定了一部体现了许多启蒙运动原则的成文宪法。

当然，这很难说是一个真正的民主国家，因为只有少数人拥有任何法律上的发言权或权利，而且宪法本身还保障了奴隶制的存在。

但它肯定也不是一个君主制国家。

不管怎样，这个小国家最终会发展壮大到我们可以专门为它制作一整期《速成课程》的程度。

与此同时，战败的保皇派，包括那些曾被承诺为王室作战就可以获得自由的奴隶，逃到了加拿大和世界其他地方。

需要说明的是，他们很少能得到英国曾承诺给予他们的、作为忠诚协助回报的经济支持。

西班牙也出现了反对开明君主改革的起义，尽管在高效且重税的政策实施之前，人们的不满就已经在不断积累了。

此外，西班牙把菲律宾的马尼拉（Manila）输给了英国，他们还失去了佛罗里达（Florida），不过，这也算不上什么悲剧。

我是一个佛罗里达人，所以我有资格开这个玩笑。

而且，这么说不太公平。

佛罗里达很可爱。

它真的是美国最适合逃避过去错误的地方，然后又会直接陷入新的错误之中。

但还是回到西班牙吧。

所以，在西半球被西班牙占领的土地上，当地人想办法表达了他们对殖民压迫的不满，有时会通过暴力抗议帝国官员的不公正行为，或者牧师的专横行为。

宗教活动家声称西班牙人是假神；在前印加（Incan）土地上，一些印加人在1742年开始的一场协同起义中积极反对西班牙政府，但很快就被镇压了。

让我们进入“思想泡泡”环节。
1. 1780年，安第斯山脉（Andes）爆发了另一场反抗西班牙统治的起义。
2. 印加人图帕克·阿马鲁（Inca Tupac Amaru）领导了一场针对西班牙当局的强大叛乱，试图恢复前印加帝国（Incan empire）。
3. 并将当地人民从西班牙日益增加的劳动和税收要求中解放出来。
4. 他的妻子米凯拉·巴斯蒂达斯（Michaela Bastidas），有印加血统。
5. 是这次起义的运营管理者和对她丈夫起义忠诚的主要执行者。
6. 在这个角色中，她特别残忍。
7. 她威胁那些偷懒的人，甚至包括她的丈夫，她曾因丈夫采取失败的策略而斥责他。
8. 她确保起义的士兵有武器和食物供应，并且能得到报酬。
9. ——这些问题图帕克·阿马鲁有时似乎会忘记。
10. 除了主要指挥军事行动的巴斯蒂达斯之外。
11. 在帝国的几个地区，整支由女性组成的部队走上了战场，她们继承了积极反抗的传统。
12. 西班牙士兵注意到了她们在战斗中对胜利的强烈渴望。
13. 称她们“比男人还男人”，并特别称其中一名战士“像她哥哥一样是个血腥的屠夫”。
14. 这次叛乱被坚决地镇压下去了，其领导人最终被捕。
15. 1781年，西班牙殖民政府（在现在的秘鲁）将米凯拉·巴斯蒂达斯手和脚绑着拖去处决，先绞死她，然后再吊死；
16. 最后他们把她的尸体切成碎片，还把她的头插在长矛上示众。
17. 不幸的是，在《速成欧洲史》中，这不是我们最后一次谈到插在长矛上的头颅。
18. 不久之后，她的丈夫也被处决并遭到肢解。

感谢“思想泡泡”！

在西班牙帝国的起义中，大约有10万人丧生——也就是说，这大约占西班牙在南美洲所有领地原住民人口的10% 。

西班牙帝国政府取得了胜利，而英国却没有，原因有很多。

一方面，西班牙政府在行动上没有那么分散，并且已经看到了英国因为在世界各地作战而遭受的痛苦。

此外，西班牙也开始了将克里奥尔人（creoles，即在殖民地出生的西班牙裔人）纳入西班牙帝国军队军官团的进程。

专业训练、进入军事学校的机会以及军事特权，都有助于培养对西班牙的忠诚。

而这与英国对待北美殖民者的方式和态度基本上是相反的。

英国认为它的北美殖民者在战斗方面毫无用处，作为军官也毫无希望。

所以西班牙在美洲的帝国暂时得以延续。

不过，也有人预见到了不同的结果。

弗朗西斯科·德·米兰达（Francisco de Miranda），一名西班牙军队中的克里奥尔官员，帮助美国革命者在约克镇（Yorktown）取得了胜利。

他观察了西班牙与秘鲁反叛者的交涉，评论道：“西班牙的特工们表现得多么狡猾和背信弃义……”

但米兰达预测：“英属美洲殖民地……的独立……必然会……成为我们自己独立的可靠前奏。”

事实上，南美洲的人们还有更艰苦的战斗在等着他们，因为他们将继续为摆脱西班牙的统治、争取自由而战。

所以，这些18世纪的战争产生了许多长期的影响。

首先，随着七年战争的结束以及普鲁士军队的壮大，腓特烈大帝看到了瓜分波兰立陶宛联邦（Poland-Lithuania）的机会，他提议将波兰的很大一部分领土在奥地利、俄罗斯和普鲁士之间进行分割。

这就是第一次瓜分波兰（First Partition of Poland）；之所以这么叫，是因为后来还会有更多次的瓜分。

与此同时，虽然英国失去了它认为利润较低的一部分帝国领土，但它保持了对加勒比产糖岛屿的统治，并将注意力转向了从印度榨取财富。

最后，在提供了关键援助，帮助美利坚合众国（United States of America）诞生之后，法国陷入了严重的财政困境，急需改革。

当法国人看着并支持在大西洋彼岸出现的一个没有君主的国家时，他们中很少有人能想到，一场伟大的革命即将到来，这场革命将使法国君主制走向灭亡——无论是字面意义上还是象征意义上的灭亡。

感谢观看。

到时候见。

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

Last time, we looked at how the monarchs did -- and didn't -- incorporate the ideas of the Enlightenment into their domestic policies.

Today, we'll look outward to how the 18th century European powers engaged with each other and beyond Europe -- which is to say that warfare is coming.

Or, continuing, I suppose, because it never really left town.

[Intro]

So, population was rising in 18th century Europe, and despite an extremely uneven distribution of wealth and lots of wartime casualties, many people were leading better lives.

For example, inventories of French people's possessions show that in 1700 women owned an average of two garments generally in solid black or brown; in 1800 that number was five garments of more varied, even bright colors.

Now, this may seem like minor progress, but here's another way of thinking about it: The average number of garments owned by people living in France rose by more in a hundred years than it had in the previous hundred thousand.

By the way, did that dress look gold to you, or blue?

And do you even remember that meme?

Probably not.

Oh god, I'm so old.

I grow old, I grow old, I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.

That's an even older meme.

At any rate, we associate these and many other improving conditions in Europe with what is called "modernity" -- an idea combining improvement and novelty that we will examine later in the series.

But when it came to warfare, Europeans were still battling it out among themselves on the continent and on the seas -- and always at great cost.

The 18th century opened with wars of the Spanish, Polish, and Austrian successions, all of which were just what their names suggest: fights over who was going to become king or queen amidst a dispute over rulership -- disputes not unlike the one at the heart of the Hundred Years War.

And so in that sense, progress had been . . . minimal.

As far as wars between states, the dominant idea in foreign relations was still to grab as much territory as possible from foreign kingdoms.

Because only by making your kingdom bigger could you also make it richer.

So for instance, as Austria fought with itself during its war of succession over whether a woman, Maria Theresa, should be allowed to ascend to the Habsburg throne, Frederick the Great of neighboring Prussia quickly mobilized his army and seized Silesia from the Habsburgs.

When I read the phrase, "seized Silesia," it rolled right off the tongue of my mind, but man.

Saying it is a completely different matter.

At any rate, Maria Theresa's rulership survived, but Habsburg control of Silesia did not.

Because of economic globalization, still other wars aimed at controlling trade routes and productive territory around the world.

For that reason, sometimes a cluster of wars in the middle of the eighteenth century has been called a "world war" or the Great War for Empire.

Like, it was a world war, but unfortunately we already have a World War I, so we're in a bit of a tight spot, name-wise.

But these wars did occur across truly global battlefields and oceans.

They included wars between the British and local Native American peoples (sometimes called the first and second Anglo-Indian Wars), and also the French and Indian War in North America.

And there was also the Seven Years War, which was fought partly within Europe, but there were also battles between Britain and its rivals -- most notably France and Spain -- in the Caribbean, the Philippines, and India.

In this complicated and many-tentacled set of wars -- or arguably a single war in many different theaters -- the French and British were ultimately fighting over who would be the dominant European force in the wider world.

Spain was a somewhat smaller player, fighting to protect its holdings in the Caribbean and the Philippines.

Native people around the world were enlisted in these struggles, and local peoples changed sides often as their interests shifted, and in the end trusted none of the Europeans, who pitted native peoples against each other and also were not known for keeping their promises.

Simultaneously, the Russians were waging war against the Ottomans in eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and the Caucasus.

In Russia, like in the other European kingdoms, the wars' costs were passed on mostly to ordinary people, who faced more efficient and demanding tax collection.

Additionally, central governments were disrupting local traditions and practices -- for instance, local traditions related to the consumption of alcohol were disrupted in Russia by HUGE increases in taxes on alcohol.

Did the center of the world just open?

Is my favorite book, The Bear and the Dragon in there?

Ah, The Bear and the Dragon by Tom Clancy.

I've never actually read it, but inside my copy of The Bear and the Dragon is this.

So in 18th century Russia, this huge tax on alcohol eventually funded 22% of the empire's total budget.

And there were other disruptions as well, arguably more important ones, including the conversion of some free peasants into serfs.

Local people fought back in a variety of ways.

The first of the extensive uprisings against the efficient and "enlightened" taxation to pay for warfare was the Pugachev Rebellion.

It was led by former Cossack and Russian army deserter Emile Pugachev.

He managed to persuade rural Russians that he was in fact Peter III, husband of Catherine II.

Now, Peter had been assassinated in 1762 within months of his accession to power, most likely at Catherine's command (and possibly by her lover).

So given that Russian history really was playing out like a soap opera, it didn't seem impossible that the murdered Czar had been hiding out all along as a Russian army deserter named Emile.

Pugachev claimed to have wandered poor and alone like Jesus until he could become the "Tsar Redeemer."

And as Peter III, Pugachev created quite the following.

He had Russian clergy and officials -- both high and low -- issue a series of measures relieving serfs of their burdens.

Pugachev also roused the Cossacks, who were fearful of being forced into the army and losing their freedom.

He confirmed their rights and liberties, and he granted everyone permission to sport beards, which, as you may recall, Peter I had outlawed.

And some three million Russians followed Pugachev until he was captured in 1774, then gruesomely tortured and executed in January 1775.

After that, Catherine again tightened the nobility's grip on serfs.

Hard on the heels of Pugachev's uprising, the American Revolution erupted over a series of taxes Britain imposed on its thirteen colonies in North America -- again to pay the costs of imperial warfare.

Now, the British government felt that the expense it had incurred in defeating the French and Native Americans in the French and Indian War should be paid by the colonists who'd profited from the protection.

But in America, we don't stand for that kind of reasoning!

There were some other things going on.

The royal government had also closed off westward expansion at the Allegheny Mountains, which in effect eradicated the property rights of people like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington who claimed land there.

And King George agreed with his advisors that the Americans were rough, stupid, and ineffective, especially as military people.

So to keep the Native Americans under control, a standing army of British soldiers should be stationed on the North American continent and financed by the colonists.

So if history is all about shifting perspectives, we're gonna shift perspectives quickly here.

From the British perspective, American colonists were taxed 1 shilling for every 26 paid by a homeland Briton, and that seemed like a pretty good deal.

But from the perspective of the North American colonists, they did not have the rights of other Englishmen, including the right not to be taxed without representation.

Colonists created a Declaration of Independence, which was issued in 1776.

The British then sent additional troops, and soon war erupted.

Those who wanted independence harassed, beat up, murdered, and destroyed the property of the loyalists, who responded in kind.

The rebels were greatly aided by the Spanish and French who sent decisive aid in the form of ships and military personnel.

And besides, the British had other concerns, including preserving their far more lucrative sugar islands in the Caribbean, as well as their holdings in India, and in Canada.

Although comparatively insignificant at the time, the newly independent colonies that became the United States established a representative form of government with a written constitution that featured many Enlightenment principles.

Now, it was hardly a true democracy, as only a minority had any legal say or rights, and the Constitution itself enshrined slavery.

But it also definitely wasn't a monarchy.

Anyway, this little country would eventually grow big enough for us to make an entire Crash Course about it.

Meanwhile, the defeated loyalists, including slaves who had been promised their freedom in return for fighting for the crown, fled to Canada and other parts of the world.

And for the record, they rarely received the financial support that the British had promised them for their faithful assistance.

Spain also saw uprisings against the reforms of the enlightened monarchs, though grievances had been piling up even before efficient and tax-heavy policies were put in place.

Also, Spain lost Manila in the Philippines to the British, and they lost Florida, which, you know, not exactly a tragedy.

I am a Floridian, so I am allowed to make that joke.

And, that's not fair.

Florida is lovely.

It really is the best place in the United States to run from your past mistakes, straight into new ones.

But back to Spain.

So, across the occupied Spanish lands in the Western Hemisphere, local people found ways to express their discontent with colonial oppression, at times violently protesting injustices by imperial officials or overbearing behavior by priests.

Religious activists claimed that the Spanish were false gods; in the former Incan lands, several Incans actively opposed the Spanish government in a concerted uprising that began in 1742, but was soon defeated.

Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

1. In 1780, another uprising battling Spanish rule broke out in the Andes.
2. Inca Tupac Amaru led a powerful rebellion against Spanish authorities in an attempt to restore the former Incan empire
3. and to liberate local people from the increased Spanish demands for labor and taxes.
4. His wife Michaela Bastidas, who was part Incan,
5. was operational manager and chief enforcer of loyalty to her husband's uprising.
6. In that role she was especially brutal.
7. She threatened slackers, even her husband, whom she chastised for following losing strategies.
8. And she ensured that the revolt's soldiers were supplied with arms and food and that they were paid
9. -- concerns that Tupac Amaru seemed to forget sometimes.
10. Alongside Bastidas, who mostly directed military activity,
11. entire units of women soldiers took to the battlefields in several parts of the empire, building on traditions of active resistance.
12. Spanish soldiers noticed them for their intense commitment to victory in battle,
13. calling them "supermasculine" and one fighter in particular "as bloody a butcher as her brother."
14. The rebellion was put down with focused determination, and its leaders were eventually captured.
15. In 1781, the Spanish colonial government (in present-day Peru) had Michaela Bastidas dragged bound hand and foot to her execution, garroted, then hanged;
16. finally they cut her body to pieces with her head posted on a pike for all to see.
17. Which, unfortunately, is not the last time we're going to be talking about heads on pikes in Crash Course European History.
18. Her husband's execution and mutilation followed shortly thereafter.

Thanks, Thought Bubble.

Some 100,000 people died in the uprisings in the Spanish empire -- that is, around ten percent of the native population in all of Spain's South American holdings.

The Spanish imperial government prevailed whereas the British did not for a number of reasons.

For one, the Spanish administration was less dispersed in its efforts and had seen how Britain suffered because it was fighting all around the world.

Also, Spain had also begun the process of integrating creoles -- people of Spanish descent born in the colonies -- into the officer corps of the Spanish imperial armies.

Professional training, access to military schools, and military privileges all served to build loyalty to Spain.

And that was essentially the opposite of British treatment and attitudes towards North American colonials.

Britain saw its North American colonials as, like, useless at fighting and hopeless as officers.

And so the Spanish Empire in the Americas survived for now.

Still, some saw a different outcome.

Francisco de Miranda, a creole official in the Spanish army, helped achieve the victory for the American Revolutionaries at Yorktown.

He watched the Spanish dealings with the rebels in Peru, observing "how astute and perfidious the Spanish agents had proved. . . ."

But Miranda predicted, "the Anglo-American colonies. . . independence. . . was bound to be . . . the infallible preliminary to our own."

And indeed, people of South America had greater battles to come as they continued to fight for their freedom from Spain.

So, these eighteenth century wars had many long-term outcomes.

First, as the Seven Years War unwound and the Prussian army built itself up, Frederick the Great saw a chance to cut up Poland-Lithuania, proposing to divide a good chunk of it among Austria, Russia, and Prussia itself.

This was the First Partition of Poland; so-called because further partitions would follow.

Meanwhile, while Britain lost what it thought of as a less lucrative part of its empire, it kept its domination of the Caribbean sugar islands and turned its attention to extracting the wealth of India.

Finally, after providing the crucial aid that allowed the birth of the United States of America, France was in dire financial straits and badly in need of reform.

As the French watched, and supported, the emergence of a nation without a monarch across the Atlantic, few of them could have imagined that a great revolution was just one episode away that would see the French monarchy beheaded -- both literally and figuratively.

Thanks for watching.

I'll see you then.
