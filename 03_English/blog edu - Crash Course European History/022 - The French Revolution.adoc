Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.


It's 1789, and Europe has been through an endless number of wars.

Territory 领土 has changed hands 易主, hundreds of thousands of people have died, and crop yields 农作物产量 have been bad lately.

War is bad for agriculture, for one thing, but also the weather hasn't been too cooperative 配合的.

Reformers 改革者 across the Dutch states and the Habsburg Netherlands want to be more like the new United States, while Poles 波兰人 are demanding that the partition 瓜分 of their country be undone 撤销.

And one kingdom had emerged a hero from all the overseas revolutions because of its support for the rebels 反叛者 in the thirteen North American colonies.

France has stood up for 支持 liberty 自由 and democracy 民主 and fraternity 博爱 -- in North America, anyway.

At home, it remained an absolute monarchy 君主专制, and was virtually 几乎 bankrupt 破产的 from all the warring 战争.

Its countryside was full of beggars 乞丐 -- as was much of the European countryside -- even as aristocrats 贵族 grew ever wealthier.

And the poor and middle-class paid virtually all the tax collected to support these ceaseless 不停的 wars.

All of which is to say that in 1789, France -- the strongest and most populous 人口众多的 country on the continent -- was in crisis 危机.


[Intro]

In 1789, Louis XVI ruled France.

He loved to hunt and tinker with 摆弄 mechanical objects 机械装置, especially locks 锁.

His wife Marie Antoinette was the daughter of Maria Theresa of the Habsburg Empire and the sister of Joseph II, its current ruler.

In a world where the marriage of two powerful royal families had long been seen as key to stability 稳定 and prosperity 繁荣, what could go wrong?

Marie Antoinette was a big spender 挥霍无度的人 who had trouble relating to 与…相处 the poor -- of which France had many.

As bad harvests 收成不好 made the price of bread soar 猛涨, more families couldn't afford to eat, or else were eating bread that was cut with up to 50% sawdust 锯末.

In response to unaffordable bread, Marie Antoinette reportedly said, "Qu'ils mangent de la brioche," which is a great opportunity to trot out 炫耀 my amazing French accent 口音.

And also, to talk about brioche 法式奶油面包, which is in the center of the world today.

In English, the line is usually translated "let them eat cake," but as you can see, brioche isn't cake exactly.

It's just a different, fancier 更精致的, more delicious kind of bread.

Mmm!
It's delicious.

Fluffy 松软的, eggy 蛋味浓的, quite light 很轻盈.

I don't understand why the peasants 农民 couldn't just eat this stuff...

Stan says I'm hopelessly out of touch 完全不了解情况, to which I say, can I have some more of that brioche?

At any rate 无论如何, France as a whole was broke 破产的.

Now, its reform-minded 有改革意识的 ministers 大臣 tried to revise 修订 the tax system so that the church and the aristocracy 贵族 would have to pay at least some taxes.

But you'll recall, there was a group of appellate judges 上诉法官, the Parlement 高等法院, who had to register 登记 royal decrees 王室法令, and they refused to register this one.

Bankers, meanwhile, refused to provide the Crown 王室 with additional loans 贷款.

Which led to a proper financial crisis 金融危机.

Let's go to the Thought Bubble.


In response to this crisis, Louis XVI was forced to summon 召集 the Estates-General 三级会议

-- that is, a group of representatives of the clergy 神职人员 (the first estate 第一等级),

the aristocracy 贵族 (second estate 第二等级),

and ordinary people 普通人 (third estate 第三等级).

In cities, towns, and villages across the kingdom, people met to set out 阐述 their grievances 不满 in cahiers 笔记本 or register books 登记簿

for their representatives to take to this historic meeting.

Meanwhile, discontent 不满 was rising as Marie Antoinette played at being a shepherdess 牧羊女

in a pretend farm 假农场 that was built for her on the grounds of Versailles 凡尔赛宫

so she could imbibe 吸入 the air of nature and play at the work so many were forced to do.

On May 5, 1789, members of the Estates-General paraded 游行 in great ceremony 隆重仪式 through Versailles to begin deliberations 审议.

Louis XVI wrote of the events that day: "Nothing happened. Went hunting."

Which just goes to show you that history is about perspective 视角.

Members of the Third Estate, meanwhile, immediately protested that their one vote as a group would always be beaten by the two votes of the first two estates.

So members of the third estate retreated to 撤退到 a nearby tennis court, declaring themselves the National Assembly 国民议会

and claiming to represent all French people better than the Estates General did.

These representatives swore (in the so-called Tennis Court Oath 网球场宣誓) that they would not disband 解散 until they had constructed a nation of individual citizens 公民 instead of a kingdom of servile subjects 臣民.

Thanks, Thought Bubble.


So, the National Assembly's moves toward enacting 制定 a reform program were backed by the muscle 力量 of ordinary people -- many of them furious 愤怒的 about injustice 不公 and poverty 贫困.

On July 14, the people of Paris seized 占领 the Bastille fortress 巴士底狱 -- a prison full of weapons 武器 and a symbol of the monarchy's ability to imprison anyone arbitrarily 任意地.

And in the countryside, peasants 农民 took over 接管 chateaux 城堡 and destroyed aristocratic titles to land and peasant services.

Terrified aristocrats met on August 4, 1789, and surrendered 放弃 their privileges 特权 as feudal lords 封建领主.

The National Assembly then elaborated 详细阐述 in a series of decrees 法令 declaring feudal society 封建社会 had come to an end.

That same month, the Assembly passed the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen 人权和公民权宣言 -- a document that protected property 财产, ensured trial by jury 陪审团审判, and guaranteed free speech 言论自由.

It read, in part: "Men are born and remain free and equal in rights."

And that included freedom of religion 宗教信仰自由.

It's hard to overstate how radical 激进的 a change that was from a France in which, just months earlier, peasants were seen as neither free nor equal, and Catholicism 天主教 was the kingdom's official religion 官方宗教.

On October 5, market women from Paris marched to Versailles in the so-called Women's March 妇女游行 to bring the king and royal family to Paris, where they could be monitored 监视 by the people.

Although the family was unharmed, some members of the royal circle, including the queen's best friend, were violated 侵犯, murdered, and mutilated 肢解.

Their heads and genitals 生殖器 were displayed on pikes 长矛.

And aristocrats began fleeing the country.

Critically, the Declaration of the Rights of Man also stated that the power of the monarch 君主 flowed not from some divinity 神灵, but from the nation 国家.

And to that end 为此, the Assembly proceeded to draw up 起草 a constitution 宪法, making the monarchy a constitutional one 君主立宪制.

Then in 1790, they adopted the Civil Constitution of the Clergy 神职人员民事组织法, ultimately confiscating 没收 church property and mandating 强制规定 the election of priests by their parishioners 教区居民.

And then in 1791, the royal family was like, "we should try to get out of here."

And they tried to flee 逃跑 but were caught.

Meanwhile, war broke out 爆发 between the revolutionary government in France and Austria and Prussia, who were intent on 一心想 crushing 镇压 the revolution and putting the royals back in full control.

Partly because they, you know, had a vested interest 既得利益.

Their relatives were on the French throne 王位, but also, as a general rule 一般来说, monarchs like monarchy 君主制.

As the republic 共和国 began to take shape 成形, so did political parties 政党.

They arranged themselves in the assembly hall 议会大厅 so that republicans 共和主义者, who wanted to do away with 废除 monarchs entirely, sat on the left and monarchists 君主主义者 sat on the right.

An array of 一系列 others grouped themselves as parties across the hall.

And from this arrangement, we got the modern idea of politicians' ideas being left, center, or right 政治立场的左、中、右.

The Jacobin club 雅各宾俱乐部, a rising political party, was to the left.

But it soon broke into 分裂成 several factions 派别 that were on the center, left, and radical left 极左派 of the political spectrum 政治光谱.

Ah, politics, where the left has a right and the right has a left and they both have centers that no one listens to.

Amid these tremendous changes, women were claiming their rightful place 正当地位 as citizens to match the official expressions of equality and rights for all.

In 1791, Olympe de Gouges, author and daughter of a butcher 屠夫, published the Declaration of the Rights of Woman 女权宣言, stating explicitly 明确地 women's equality with men.

Women participated in 参与 political clubs and successfully pushed for 推动 laws that ended men's power over the family and also ended the practice of men getting a larger percentage of inheritances 遗产 than women.

As war advanced, women also lobbied for 游说争取 the right to serve in the army.

And was war ever advancing!

In 1792, the Parisian masses 群众, threatened by the approach of foreign royal armies, took extreme action 采取极端行动.

They invaded the Parisian palace where the royal family lived -- and forced new elections for a National Convention 国民公会.

Then in the fall of 1792, further violence produced the abolition 废除 of the French monarchy and a call for every other kingdom to do the same: "All governments are our enemies, all people our friends," the Edict of Fraternity 友爱法令 read.

Once the Convention had declared France a republic, in January 1793, Louis XVI was executed 处决 after a narrow vote 以微弱多数票通过.

A new instrument of execution 行刑工具 called the guillotine 断头台 carried out what would soon become a bloodbath 大屠杀 against many supposed enemies of the people.

Because it killed so swiftly 迅速地 and allegedly 据说 painlessly 无痛苦地, the guillotine was considered an enlightened 开明的 form of execution.

And that brings us to Maximilien Robespierre.

With the king dead and the church legally abandoned, the Jacobins under Robespierre's leadership committed the nation to a so-called reign of virtue 美德统治 and complete obedience to 完全服从 Rousseau's idea of the general will of the people 人民的公意 -- despite all those freedoms agreed upon in the Declaration of the Rights of Man.

The Jacobins transformed culture: festivals 节日 celebrated patriotic virtue 爱国美德; churches were turned into temples of reason 理性圣殿; dishware 餐具 carried patriotic mottos 爱国标语; a new "rational" calendar 日历 was created; and clothing was in red, white, and blue -- the colors of the revolutionary flag 革命旗帜.

Meanwhile, the Committee of Public Safety 公共安全委员会, with its Orwellian name 奥威尔式的名称 and Orwellian mission 奥威尔式的使命, presided over 主持 the "Terror" 恐怖统治 in which people from all classes and walks of life 各行各业 -- at least 40,000 of them -- were executed in the name of 以…名义 supporting the nation through purges 清洗 of enemies of the general will.

Among these in the autumn of 1793 were Queen Marie Antoinette, Olympe de Gouges, former mistresses of Louis XVI's grandfather, and other well-known women.

Spies 间谍 and traitors 叛徒 were said to be lurking 潜伏 everywhere, especially in women's political clubs and anywhere women congregated 聚集.

Women seen in public were said to be threats to the revolution.

But as French soldiers began to win their wars abroad, people tired of 厌倦 revolutionary bloodshed 流血事件 and mounted an effective opposition 发起有效反抗.

Counterrevolutionary uprisings 反革命起义 in the Vendée region of France and activism 行动主义 by moderates 温和派 led to the overthrow 推翻 and execution of Robespierre and several of his closest allies 盟友.

And by 1795, new factions 派别 headed a conservative government called the Directory 督政府.

It inspired the French army to spread revolution to other parts of Europe.

That army was enthusiastic for good reason: the revolution's anti-aristocratic spirit 反贵族精神 allowed for ordinary soldiers to become officers -- positions that were formerly allotted exclusively to 专门分配给 noblemen 贵族.

One such commoner 平民 was named Napoleon Bonaparte.

He was extraordinarily charismatic 极具魅力的, not particularly short, and with other ambitious 有野心的 newcomers, took revolution across the low countries, German states, and even into Italy.

But even without French armies advancing it, revolution was erupting 爆发.

During the French Revolution, Poles had revised their constitution, for instance, in 1791 and granted rights to urban people 城市居民.

But a far different outcome from that in France awaited: while the French pursued revolution, the other continental powers -- Russia, Austria, and Prussia -- finished divvying up 瓜分 Poland among themselves so that it no longer existed.

But Enlightenment ideas of freedom 启蒙运动的自由思想 continued to spread.

They spread in Spanish colonies 殖民地 in South America, and also in the rich French sugar colony of St. Domingue.

The French Revolution, or maybe more properly, the French Revolutions helped people in Saint Domingue understand that they, too, could seek freedom.

And the ensuing 随后的 Haitian Revolution 海地革命 inspired slave activism 奴隶解放运动 in other places, which you can learn much more about in an episode of Crash Course World History on that topic.

So when we think about why The French Revolution 法国大革命 is so important, one of the big reasons is that it consolidated 巩固 the idea that the nation is composed of 由…组成 citizens.

Mostly citizen men at first -- a fraternity 兄弟关系 or brotherhood that replaced a kingdom in which a monarch ruled his subjects.

And this was a huge change for Europe, and eventually the world, because it helped usher in 引入 the idea of nation-states 民族国家, and the idea that the most important people within those nation-states are the citizens.

And so enthusiasts 热衷者 for freedom flocked to 涌向 France from all corners of Europe -- if not in person 亲自 then at least in their imaginations.

"Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive," wrote poet William Wordsworth.

In contrast 相比之下, opponents like the British statesman 政治家 and thinker Edmund Burke deplored 谴责 the rapid change and attacks on traditional institutions 传统制度 and the abandonment of accumulated wisdom 积累的智慧 from past ages.

Burke's theories launched conservative political ideology 保守主义政治思想 in the revolution's aftermath 在革命之后.

And we should be clear that the revolution was extremely violent 暴力的, and in many cases replaced poverty with poverty, and injustice with injustice.

History, again, is as much about where you sit 立场 as it is about what happened.

But for the moment, however, revolutionary ferment 动荡 remained alive, exemplified in 体现在 the writings of English journalist Mary Wollstonecraft, who witnessed the revolution first-hand 亲身体验 by going to Paris.

She defended the quote "rights of man" in a 1791 book and in 1792 she published A Vindication of the Rights of Woman 《女权辩护》.

This enduring work 不朽之作 compared the women of her day to the aristocracy -- little educated, simpering 矫揉造作的 and ignorant 无知的.

Lacking any rational 理性的, developed skills, women in Wollstonecraft's formulation 描述 were, like aristocrats, conniving 诡计多端的 and manipulative 善于操纵的 instead of being forthright 直率的, skilled, and open like Emile in the eponymous 同名的 Rousseau novel.

To end this debased 堕落的 condition, women needed education and legal protection of their person and their property.

That is, legal equality 法律平等.

In the long run 从长远来看, the French Revolution had many important outcomes; as we've discussed, a nation formed by consensus 共识 of legally equal citizens came to replace a kingdom of subjects ruled by a king.

The nation's bedrock 基石 was a set of values including the rule of law 法治, the right of free speech 言论自由权, and the ownership of property 财产所有权.

Rather than the nation's bedrock being a king, or a religion.

This idea of individual rights 个人权利, which would later be called human rights 人权, of course becomes extremely important in the 20th century and beyond.

Yet in the French Revolution and in many other revolutions, as we'll see, the nation in times of stress 压力时期 could jettison 抛弃 this consensus about the rule of law and rights and become dictatorial 独裁的, searching out 找出 enemies within and relying on 依靠 force instead of consensus building 达成共识.

After 1795, further big changes lay ahead for France and Europe as Napoleon Bonaparte came to play an outsized role 发挥巨大作用 on the world stage, and the new republic became a dictatorship 独裁统治 once more.

But we'll get to that shortly.

Thanks for watching.

And yes, that was a Napoleon joke.

大家好，我是约翰·格林，这里是《速成欧洲史》。 +

现在是1789年，欧洲经历了无数场战争。 +
领土多次易主，数十万人丧生，而且最近农作物收成也不好。 +
一方面，战争对农业不利，但同时天气也不太配合。 +
荷兰各州（Dutch states）和哈布斯堡尼德兰（Habsburg Netherlands）的改革者们希望能像新生的美国（United States）一样，而波兰人（Poles）则要求取消对他们国家的瓜分。 +
有一个王国在所有海外革命中成为了英雄，因为它支持了北美十三个殖民地（thirteen North American colonies）的反叛者。 +
法国（France）支持了自由、民主和平等——至少在北美是这样。 +
在国内，它仍然是一个绝对君主制国家，并且由于连年战争，实际上已经破产。 +
它的乡村地区到处都是乞丐——欧洲大部分乡村地区也是如此——而贵族们却越来越富有。 +
穷人和中产阶级几乎承担了为支持这些无休止的战争而征收的所有税款。 +
所有这些都表明，在1789年，法国——欧洲大陆上最强大、人口最多的国家——陷入了危机。 +

[开场介绍] +

1789年，路易十六（Louis XVI）统治着法国。 +
他喜欢打猎，还喜欢摆弄机械物品，尤其是锁具。 +
他的妻子玛丽·安托瓦内特（Marie Antoinette）是哈布斯堡帝国（Habsburg Empire）的玛丽亚·特蕾西亚（Maria Theresa）的女儿，也是现任统治者约瑟夫二世（Joseph II）的妹妹。 +
在一个两个强大王室联姻长期以来被视为稳定与繁荣关键的世界里，还能出什么岔子呢？ +
玛丽·安托瓦内特是个挥霍无度的人，她很难理解穷人的处境——而法国的穷人有很多。 +
由于收成不好，面包价格飞涨，越来越多的家庭买不起食物，或者只能吃掺了高达50%锯末的面包。 +
据说，面对买不起的面包，玛丽·安托瓦内特说了一句“Qu'ils mangent de la brioche”，这可是展示我超棒法语口音的好机会。 +
同时，也可以聊聊布里欧修面包（brioche），它现在就在世界的中心位置哦。 +
这句话在英语里通常被翻译成“let them eat cake”（让他们吃蛋糕），但正如你们所见，布里欧修面包并不完全是蛋糕。 +
它只是一种不同的、更精致、更美味的面包。 +
嗯！
真好吃。
松软、有蛋香，很轻盈。 +
我不明白为什么农民们就不能吃这种东西呢…… +
斯坦说我完全脱离实际，对此我想说，我能再吃点那个布里欧修面包吗？ +
无论如何，法国作为一个整体已经破产了。 +
当时，有改革意识的大臣们试图修改税收制度，以便教会（church）和贵族（aristocracy）至少也要缴纳一些税款。 +
但你们还记得吧，有一群上诉法官，即高等法院（Parlement），他们需要登记皇家法令，而他们拒绝登记这项法令。 +
与此同时，银行家们拒绝向王室提供额外贷款。 +
这就引发了一场真正的金融危机。 +

让我们进入“思想泡泡”环节。 +
为了应对这场危机，路易十六被迫召集了三级会议（Estates-General） +
——也就是由神职人员（第一等级，the first estate）、 +
贵族（第二等级，second estate） +
和普通民众（第三等级，third estate）的代表组成的团体。 +
在全国的城市、城镇和村庄里，人们聚集在一起，在陈情书（cahiers）或登记簿上写下他们的不满 +
以便他们的代表能将这些带到这次历史性的会议上。 +
与此同时，玛丽·安托瓦内特在凡尔赛宫（Versailles）的 grounds上为她建造的一个仿造农场里扮演牧羊女，这使得不满情绪日益高涨 +
这样她就可以呼吸大自然的空气，体验许多人被迫从事的劳动。 +
1789年5月5日，三级会议的成员们在凡尔赛宫举行了盛大的仪式，开始进行商议。 +
路易十六在当天的记录中写道：“没发生什么事。去打猎了。” +
这恰恰向你们表明，历史是取决于视角的。 +
与此同时，第三等级的成员们立即抗议说，他们作为一个团体只有一票，而前两个等级各有一票，他们的票总是会被前两个等级击败。 +
于是，第三等级的成员们退到了附近的一个网球场，宣布自己为国民议会（National Assembly） +
并声称他们比三级会议更能代表全体法国人民。 +
这些代表们宣誓（即所谓的《网球场宣誓》，Tennis Court Oath），在他们建立起一个由独立公民组成的国家，而不是一个由顺从的臣民组成的王国之前，他们绝不解散。 +

感谢“思想泡泡”！ +

因此，国民议会实施改革计划的行动得到了普通民众的支持——他们中的许多人对不公正和贫困感到愤怒。 +
1789年7月14日，巴黎（Paris）人民攻占了巴士底狱（Bastille fortress）——这是一座装满武器的监狱，也是君主可以任意监禁任何人的权力的象征。 +
在乡村，农民们占领了城堡（chateaux），销毁了贵族的土地所有权证书和农民应尽义务的文书。 +
惊恐的贵族们于1789年8月4日开会，放弃了他们作为封建领主的特权。 +
随后，国民议会在一系列法令中详细阐明，封建（feudal）社会已经结束。 +
同月，议会通过了《人权和公民权宣言》（Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen）——这是一份保护财产、确保陪审团审判并保障言论自由的文件。 +
它的部分内容是：“人人生而自由，在权利上一律平等。” +
这其中包括宗教信仰自由。 +
很难高估这一变化的激进程度，因为就在几个月前的法国，农民既不被认为是自由的，也不被认为是平等的，而且天主教（Catholicism）是王国的官方宗教。 +
1789年10月5日，来自巴黎的市场妇女们进行了所谓的“妇女大游行”（Women's March），前往凡尔赛宫，将国王和王室成员带回巴黎，以便人民能够监督他们。 +
虽然王室成员没有受到伤害，但王室圈子里的一些人，包括王后的密友，遭到了侵犯、谋杀和肢解。 +
他们的头颅和生殖器被插在长矛上示众。 +
贵族们开始逃离这个国家。 +
关键的是，《人权宣言》还指出，君主的权力并非来自某种神灵，而是来自国家。 +
为此，议会着手起草宪法，使君主制成为君主立宪制。 +
然后在1790年，他们通过了《教士公民组织法》（Civil Constitution of the Clergy），最终没收了教会财产，并规定由教区居民选举牧师。 +
接着在1791年，王室成员们心想：“我们应该设法离开这里。” +
他们试图逃跑，但被抓住了。 +
与此同时，法国的革命政府与奥地利（Austria）和普鲁士（Prussia）爆发了战争，奥地利和普鲁士一心想要镇压革命，让王室重新完全掌控国家。 +
部分原因是，他们有既得利益。 +
他们的亲属在法国的王位上，而且，一般来说，君主们都喜欢君主制。 +
随着共和国（republic）开始成形，政党也随之出现。 +
他们在议会大厅里就座，以至于那些想要彻底废除君主制的共和派坐在左边，而君主主义者坐在右边。 +
其他各种各样的人在大厅里组成了不同的政党。 +
从这种座位安排中，我们产生了现代意义上关于政治家的思想分为左派、中间派和右派的概念。 +
雅各宾俱乐部（Jacobin club），一个崛起的政党，属于左派。 +
但它很快就分裂成了几个派别，分别处于政治光谱的中间派、左派和极左派。 +
啊，政治，在这里左派有它的右派观点，右派有它的左派观点，而他们都有中间派观点，却没人理会。 +

在这些巨大的变革中，女性们要求获得作为公民应有的地位，以符合官方所宣称的人人平等和权利的表述。 +
1791年，作家奥林普·德·古热（Olympe de Gouges），一位屠夫的女儿，发表了《女权宣言》（Declaration of the Rights of Woman），明确阐述了女性与男性平等。 +
女性参与了政治俱乐部，并成功推动了一些法律的通过，这些法律结束了男性对家庭的控制权，也结束了男性在继承财产时比女性分得更大比例的惯例。 +
随着战争的推进，女性们还游说争取参军的权利。 +
而战争还在不断推进！ +
1792年，巴黎群众受到外国王室军队逼近的威胁，采取了极端行动。 +
他们冲进了王室成员居住的巴黎宫殿——并迫使举行新的国民公会（National Convention）选举。 +
然后在1792年秋天，进一步的暴力事件导致法国君主制被废除，并呼吁其他所有王国也这样做：“所有政府都是我们的敌人，所有人民都是我们的朋友。” 《友爱法令》（Edict of Fraternity）中这样写道。 +
国民公会宣布法国为共和国后，1793年1月，路易十六在一次微弱多数的投票后被处决。 +
一种名为断头台（guillotine）的新的处决工具被用来处决许多所谓的人民公敌，很快就演变成了一场大屠杀。 +
因为断头台杀人速度很快，而且据说没有痛苦，所以它被认为是一种开明的处决方式。 +
这就引出了马克西米连·罗伯斯庇尔（Maximilien Robespierre）。 +
国王死了，教会在法律上被抛弃，在罗伯斯庇尔的领导下，雅各宾派让国家致力于所谓的“美德统治”，并完全服从卢梭（Rousseau）关于人民公意（general will）的理念——尽管《人权宣言》中认可了所有那些自由。 +
雅各宾派改变了文化：举办节日来颂扬爱国美德；教堂被改造成了理性圣殿（temples of reason）；餐具上印着爱国口号；创造了一种新的“理性”日历；服装采用红、白、蓝三色——这是革命旗帜的颜色。 +
与此同时，公共安全委员会（Committee of Public Safety），有着奥威尔式的名字和奥威尔式的使命，主导了“恐怖统治”（Terror），在这场恐怖统治中，来自各个阶级和各行各业的人——至少有4万人——以支持国家、清除公意之敌的名义被处决。 +
1793年秋天被处决的人中有王后玛丽·安托瓦内特、奥林普·德·古热、路易十六祖父的前情妇，以及其他一些知名女性。 +
据说间谍和叛徒无处不在，尤其是在女性政治俱乐部以及女性聚集的任何地方。 +
在公共场合出现的女性被认为是对革命的威胁。 +
但随着法国士兵开始在国外赢得战争，人们厌倦了革命带来的流血事件，并发起了有效的反对行动。 +
法国旺代（Vendée）地区的反革命起义，以及温和派的行动，导致罗伯斯庇尔和他的几个亲密盟友被推翻并处决。 +
到1795年，新的派别领导了一个名为督政府（Directory）的保守政府。 +
它激励法国军队将革命传播到欧洲其他地区。 +
法国军队充满热情是有原因的：革命的反贵族精神使得普通士兵有机会成为军官——而这些职位以前是专门分配给贵族的。 +
有一个这样的平民名叫拿破仑·波拿巴（Napoleon Bonaparte）。 +
他极具魅力，并不特别矮，他和其他有野心的新人一起，将革命带到了低地国家（low countries）、德意志各邦（German states），甚至意大利（Italy）。 +
但即使没有法国军队的推动，革命也在爆发。 +
例如，在法国大革命期间，波兰人在1791年修改了他们的宪法，赋予了城市居民权利。 +
但等待他们的结果与法国大不相同：当法国进行革命时，其他欧洲大陆强国——俄罗斯（Russia）、奥地利和普鲁士——完成了对波兰的瓜分，以至于波兰不复存在了。 +
但启蒙运动（Enlightenment）的自由思想继续传播。 +
它们传播到了西班牙在南美洲（South America）的殖民地，也传播到了法国富裕的产糖殖民地圣多明戈（St. Domingue）。 +
法国大革命，或者更确切地说，一系列法国大革命，帮助圣多明戈的人们认识到，他们也可以追求自由。 +
随后的海地革命（Haitian Revolution）激发了其他地方的奴隶运动，关于这个话题，你可以在《速成世界史》的某一集中了解更多。 +

所以当我们思考为什么法国大革命如此重要时，一个重要原因是它巩固了国家由公民组成的这一理念。 +
起初主要是男性公民——一个兄弟会取代了君主统治臣民的王国。 +
这对欧洲，最终对世界来说都是一个巨大的变化，因为它推动了民族国家的理念，以及在这些民族国家中最重要的人是公民的理念。 +
因此，自由的拥护者们从欧洲的各个角落涌向法国——即使不能亲身前往，至少在他们的想象中是这样。 +
诗人威廉·华兹华斯（William Wordsworth）写道：“能活在那个黎明是何等幸福。” +
相比之下，像英国政治家和思想家埃德蒙·伯克（Edmund Burke）这样的反对者则对这种迅速的变革、对传统制度的攻击以及对过去积累的智慧的抛弃感到痛惜。 +
伯克的理论在法国大革命之后催生了保守的政治意识形态。 +
我们应该清楚，法国大革命极其暴力，而且在很多情况下，它只是用贫困取代了贫困，用不公正取代了不公正。 +
历史，再一次，既取决于发生了什么，也取决于你的立场。 +
但目前，革命的热情依然高涨，英国记者玛丽·沃斯通克拉夫特（Mary Wollstonecraft）的作品就是例证，她亲自前往巴黎见证了这场革命。 +
她在1791年的一本书中为“人权”进行了辩护，1792年她出版了《女权辩护》（A Vindication of the Rights of Woman）。 +
这部不朽的作品将她那个时代的女性与贵族相提并论——缺乏教育、矫揉造作且无知。 +
按照沃斯通克拉夫特的说法，缺乏任何理性的、成熟的技能的女性，就像贵族一样，工于算计、善于操纵，而不像卢梭同名小说《爱弥儿》（Emile）中的爱弥儿那样坦率、有技能且开放。 +
为了结束这种堕落的状况，女性需要接受教育，并在法律上保护她们的人身和财产。 +
也就是说，法律上的平等。 +
从长远来看，法国大革命产生了许多重要的结果；正如我们所讨论的，一个由法律上平等的公民达成共识而形成的国家，取代了一个由国王统治臣民的王国。 +
这个国家的基石是一系列价值观，包括法治、言论自由权和财产所有权。 +
而不是以国王或宗教作为国家的基石。 +
个人权利的这一理念，后来被称为人权，当然在20世纪及以后变得极其重要。 +
然而，正如我们将看到的，在法国大革命以及许多其他革命中，当国家处于困境时，可能会抛弃关于法治和权利的这种共识，变得独裁，在国内寻找敌人，依靠武力而不是建立共识。 +
1795年之后，法国和欧洲还将面临进一步的重大变革，因为拿破仑·波拿巴在世界舞台上开始扮演重要角色，新成立的共和国再次变成了独裁政权。 +

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

It's 1789, and Europe has been through an endless number of wars.

Territory has changed hands, hundreds of thousands of people have died, and crop yields have been bad lately.

War is bad for agriculture, for one thing, but also the weather hasn't been too cooperative.

Reformers across the Dutch states and the Habsburg Netherlands want to be more like the new United States, while Poles are demanding that the partition of their country be undone.

And one kingdom had emerged a hero from all the overseas revolutions because of its support for the rebels in the thirteen North American colonies.

France has stood up for liberty and democracy and fraternity -- in North America, anyway.

At home, it remained an absolute monarchy, and was virtually bankrupt from all the warring.

Its countryside was full of beggars -- as was much of the European countryside -- even as aristocrats grew ever wealthier.

And the poor and middle-class paid virtually all the tax collected to support these ceaseless wars.

All of which is to say that in 1789, France -- the strongest and most populous country on the continent -- was in crisis.

[Intro]

In 1789, Louis XVI ruled France.

He loved to hunt and tinker with mechanical objects, especially locks.

His wife Marie Antoinette was the daughter of Maria Theresa of the Habsburg Empire and the sister of Joseph II, its current ruler.

In a world where the marriage of two powerful royal families had long been seen as key to stability and prosperity, what could go wrong?

Marie Antoinette was a big spender who had trouble relating to the poor -- of which France had many.

As bad harvests made the price of bread soar, more families couldn't afford to eat, or else were eating bread that was cut with up to 50% sawdust.

In response to unaffordable bread, Marie Antoinette reportedly said, "Qu'ils mangent de la brioche," which is a great opportunity to trot out my amazing French accent.

And also, to talk about brioche, which is in the center of the world today.

In English, the line is usually translated "let them eat cake," but as you can see, brioche isn't cake exactly.

It's just a different, fancier, more delicious kind of bread.

Mmm!

It's delicious.

Fluffy, eggy, quite light.

I don't understand why the peasants couldn't just eat this stuff...

Stan says I'm hopelessly out of touch, to which I say, can I have some more of that brioche?

At any rate, France as a whole was broke.

Now, its reform-minded ministers tried to revise the tax system so that the church and the aristocracy would have to pay at least some taxes.

But you'll recall, there was a group of appellate judges, the Parlement, who had to register royal decrees, and they refused to register this one.

Bankers, meanwhile, refused to provide the Crown with additional loans.

Which led to a proper financial crisis.

Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

In response to this crisis, Louis XVI was forced to summon the Estates-General
-- that is, a group of representatives of the clergy (the first estate),
the aristocracy (second estate),
and ordinary people (third estate).
In cities, towns, and villages across the kingdom, people met to set out their grievances in cahiers or register books
for their representatives to take to this historic meeting.
Meanwhile, discontent was rising as Marie Antoinette played at being a shepherdess
in a pretend farm that was built for her on the grounds of Versailles
so she could imbibe the air of nature and play at the work so many were forced to do.
On May 5, 1789, members of the Estates-General paraded in great ceremony through Versailles to begin deliberations.
Louis XVI wrote of the events that day: "Nothing happened. Went hunting."
Which just goes to show you that history is about perspective.
Members of the Third Estate, meanwhile, immediately protested that their one vote as a group would always be beaten by the two votes of the first two estates.
So members of the third estate retreated to a nearby tennis court, declaring themselves the National Assembly
and claiming to represent all French people better than the Estates General did.
These representatives swore (in the so-called Tennis Court Oath) that they would not disband until they had constructed a nation of individual citizens instead of a kingdom of servile subjects.
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

So, the National Assembly's moves toward enacting a reform program were backed by the muscle of ordinary people -- many of them furious about injustice and poverty.

On July 14, the people of Paris seized the Bastille fortress -- a prison full of weapons and a symbol of the monarchy's ability to imprison anyone arbitrarily.

And in the countryside, peasants took over chateaux and destroyed aristocratic titles to land and peasant services.

Terrified aristocrats met on August 4, 1789, and surrendered their privileges as feudal lords.

The National Assembly then elaborated in a series of decrees declaring feudal society had come to an end.

That same month, the Assembly passed the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen -- a document that protected property, ensured trial by jury, and guaranteed free speech.

It read, in part: "Men are born and remain free and equal in rights."

And that included freedom of religion.

It's hard to overstate how radical a change that was from a France in which, just months earlier, peasants were seen as neither free nor equal, and Catholicism was the kingdom's official religion.

On October 5, market women from Paris marched to Versailles in the so-called Women's March to bring the king and royal family to Paris, where they could be monitored by the people.

Although the family was unharmed, some members of the royal circle, including the queen's best friend, were violated, murdered, and mutilated.

Their heads and genitals were displayed on pikes.

And aristocrats began fleeing the country.

Critically, the Declaration of the Rights of Man also stated that the power of the monarch flowed not from some divinity, but from the nation.

And to that end, the Assembly proceeded to draw up a constitution, making the monarchy a constitutional one.

Then in 1790, they adopted the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, ultimately confiscating church property and mandating the election of priests by their parishioners.

And then in 1791, the royal family was like, "we should try to get out of here."

And they tried to flee but were caught.

Meanwhile, war broke out between the revolutionary government in France and Austria and Prussia, who were intent on crushing the revolution and putting the royals back in full control.

Partly because they, you know, had a vested interest.

Their relatives were on the French throne, but also, as a general rule, monarchs like monarchy.

As the republic began to take shape, so did political parties.

They arranged themselves in the assembly hall so that republicans, who wanted to do away with monarchs entirely, sat on the left and monarchists sat on the right.

An array of others grouped themselves as parties across the hall.

And from this arrangement, we got the modern idea of politicians' ideas being left, center, or right.

The Jacobin club, a rising political party, was to the left.

But it soon broke into several factions that were on the center, left, and radical left of the political spectrum.

Ah, politics, where the left has a right and the right has a left and they both have centers that no one listens to.

Amid these tremendous changes, women were claiming their rightful place as citizens to match the official expressions of equality and rights for all.

In 1791, Olympe de Gouges, author and daughter of a butcher, published the Declaration of the Rights of Woman, stating explicitly women's equality with men.

Women participated in political clubs and successfully pushed for laws that ended men's power over the family and also ended the practice of men getting a larger percentage of inheritances than women.

As war advanced, women also lobbied for the right to serve in the army.

And was war ever advancing!

In 1792, the Parisian masses, threatened by the approach of foreign royal armies, took extreme action.

They invaded the Parisian palace where the royal family lived -- and forced new elections for a National Convention.

Then in the fall of 1792, further violence produced the abolition of the French monarchy and a call for every other kingdom to do the same: "All governments are our enemies, all people our friends," the Edict of Fraternity read.

Once the Convention had declared France a republic, in January 1793, Louis XVI was executed after a narrow vote.

A new instrument of execution called the guillotine carried out what would soon become a bloodbath against many supposed enemies of the people.

Because it killed so swiftly and allegedly painlessly, the guillotine was considered an enlightened form of execution.

And that brings us to Maximilien Robespierre.

With the king dead and the church legally abandoned, the Jacobins under Robespierre's leadership committed the nation to a so-called reign of virtue and complete obedience to Rousseau's idea of the general will of the people -- despite all those freedoms agreed upon in the Declaration of the Rights of Man.

The Jacobins transformed culture: festivals celebrated patriotic virtue; churches were turned into temples of reason; dishware carried patriotic mottos; a new "rational" calendar was created; and clothing was in red, white, and blue -- the colors of the revolutionary flag.

Meanwhile, the Committee of Public Safety, with its Orwellian name and Orwellian mission, presided over the "Terror" in which people from all classes and walks of life -- at least 40,000 of them -- were executed in the name of supporting the nation through purges of enemies of the general will.

Among these in the autumn of 1793 were Queen Marie Antoinette, Olympe de Gouges, former mistresses of Louis XVI's grandfather, and other well-known women.

Spies and traitors were said to be lurking everywhere, especially in women's political clubs and anywhere women congregated.

Women seen in public were said to be threats to the revolution.

But as French soldiers began to win their wars abroad, people tired of revolutionary bloodshed and mounted an effective opposition.

Counterrevolutionary uprisings in the Vendée region of France and activism by moderates led to the overthrow and execution of Robespierre and several of his closest allies.

And by 1795, new factions headed a conservative government called the Directory.

It inspired the French army to spread revolution to other parts of Europe.

That army was enthusiastic for good reason: the revolution's anti-aristocratic spirit allowed for ordinary soldiers to become officers -- positions that were formerly allotted exclusively to noblemen.

One such commoner was named Napoleon Bonaparte.

He was extraordinarily charismatic, not particularly short, and with other ambitious newcomers, took revolution across the low countries, German states, and even into Italy.

But even without French armies advancing it, revolution was erupting.

During the French Revolution, Poles had revised their constitution, for instance, in 1791 and granted rights to urban people.

But a far different outcome from that in France awaited: while the French pursued revolution, the other continental powers -- Russia, Austria, and Prussia -- finished divvying up Poland among themselves so that it no longer existed.

But Enlightenment ideas of freedom continued to spread.

They spread in Spanish colonies in South America, and also in the rich French sugar colony of St. Domingue.

The French Revolution, or maybe more properly, the French Revolutions helped people in Saint Domingue understand that they, too, could seek freedom.

And the ensuing Haitian Revolution inspired slave activism in other places, which you can learn much more about in an episode of Crash Course World History on that topic.

So when we think about why The French Revolution is so important, one of the big reasons is that it consolidated the idea that the nation is composed of citizens.

Mostly citizen men at first -- a fraternity or brotherhood that replaced a kingdom in which a monarch ruled his subjects.

And this was a huge change for Europe, and eventually the world, because it helped usher in the idea of nation-states, and the idea that the most important people within those nation-states are the citizens.

And so enthusiasts for freedom flocked to France from all corners of Europe -- if not in person then at least in their imaginations.

"Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive," wrote poet William Wordsworth.

In contrast, opponents like the British statesman and thinker Edmund Burke deplored the rapid change and attacks on traditional institutions and the abandonment of accumulated wisdom from past ages.

Burke's theories launched conservative political ideology in the revolution's aftermath.

And we should be clear that the revolution was extremely violent, and in many cases replaced poverty with poverty, and injustice with injustice.

History, again, is as much about where you sit as it is about what happened.

But for the moment, however, revolutionary ferment remained alive, exemplified in the writings of English journalist Mary Wollstonecraft, who witnessed the revolution first-hand by going to Paris.

She defended the quote "rights of man" in a 1791 book and in 1792 she published A Vindication of the Rights of Woman.

This enduring work compared the women of her day to the aristocracy -- little educated, simpering and ignorant.

Lacking any rational, developed skills, women in Wollstonecraft's formulation were, like aristocrats, conniving and manipulative instead of being forthright, skilled, and open like Emile in the eponymous Rousseau novel.

To end this debased condition, women needed education and legal protection of their person and their property.

That is, legal equality.

In the long run, the French Revolution had many important outcomes; as we've discussed, a nation formed by consensus of legally equal citizens came to replace a kingdom of subjects ruled by a king.

The nation's bedrock was a set of values including the rule of law, the right of free speech, and the ownership of property.

Rather than the nation's bedrock being a king, or a religion.

This idea of individual rights, which would later be called human rights, of course becomes extremely important in the 20th century and beyond.

Yet in the French Revolution and in many other revolutions, as we'll see, the nation in times of stress could jettison this consensus about the rule of law and rights and become dictatorial, searching out enemies within and relying on force instead of consensus building.

After 1795, further big changes lay ahead for France and Europe as Napoleon Bonaparte came to play an outsized role on the world stage, and the new republic became a dictatorship once more.

But we'll get to that shortly.

Thanks for watching.

And yes, that was a Napoleon joke.
