== 释义

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

So in our last episode, we saw the Habsburgs 哈布斯堡家族, with the help of Romanians 罗马尼亚人 and some others, drive the Ottomans 奥斯曼人 out of large swaths 大片区域 of Eastern Europe, which started the Habsburg expansion 扩张 eastward.

But there were some other important states making big moves 采取重大行动 during the 17th century.

Today we're going to focus on two of them: Russia, which sought stability 稳定 after a time of troubles 动荡时期, and the house of Brandenburg-Prussia 勃兰登堡 - 普鲁士, a small state that within two centuries would grow to become extraordinarily 极其地 powerful.

[Music]

In the huge Russian Empire 俄罗斯帝国, Tsar Peter I 沙皇彼得一世 first became an outsized monarch 庞大的君主 -- literally 确实地.

He was 6'9" tall, which is... uh... like 3 m?

Yeah, just say with authority 权威地, Green: "He was 3 m tall."

Don't write that on your tests.

Now, early in Peter's life, his future didn't look particularly promising 有前途的.

He was born in 1672, and he was not first in line to 排在…的首位 the Russian throne 王位.

His half-sister Sophia was ruling Russia at the time as regent 摄政王 for the young Romanov brothers, of whom Peter was the youngest.

Sophia wanted to become the permanent ruler 永久统治者, but Peter and his supporters had other ideas.

At the time, many interest groups 利益集团 in Russia helped shape who ended up with political power 政治权力, including the Orthodox Church 东正教会, the army, the aristocracy 贵族阶级, and wealthy traders 富有的商人.

And as Peter and his brothers came of age 成年, these groups negotiated 谈判 to arrive at a consensus candidate 达成共识的候选人 for tsar, and then the Russian people had to seal the deal 达成协议, so to speak 可以说, via 通过 public demonstrations 公开示威 of acclaim 欢呼 and approval 认可, which developed the sacred trust 神圣的信任 between the ruler and the ruled 统治者与被统治者.

In short 简而言之, political power in this monarchy 君主制 was not as simple as "the tsar has all of it."

And Peter only became tsar with the help of his advisers 顾问 and the support of powerful interest groups in Russia.

He became an autocratic ruler 专制统治者, but the autocracy 专制统治 was intertwined with 与…交织在一起 widespread -- if certainly not universal 普遍的 -- public support from the Russian people.

What I'm getting at 我的意思是 is that the relationship between the government and the governed 被治理者 is always complex 复杂的, and the example of the Russian monarchy 君主制 is important partly because it helps us to see that even absolutist governments 专制政府 could only retain 维持 their power by having support from outside institutions 机构 and individuals.

Now, Peter tackled 处理 every facet 方面 of state-building 国家建设.

He reorganized 重组 both the military 军队 and the nobility 贵族, and in doing so also reorganized who had political power and how they could wield 行使 it.

For the nobility, he created a precise table of ranks 精确的等级表, with each promotion 晋升 to a higher rank depending on the aristocrat 贵族 performing service to the state 为国家服务.

This reform 改革 aimed to end older political practices 政治惯例 based on networking 建立关系网 and nepotism 任人唯亲 and favoritism 偏袒, and instead make the aristocracy more of a meritocracy 精英管理体制.

Peter also eliminated 消除 the power of the patriarch 牧首 of the Russian Orthodox Church by leaving the post 职位 vacant 空缺的 and setting up 设立 a council 委员会, or Senate 参议院, of laypeople 外行 as overseers 监督者, headed, of course, by the tsar.

Peter was also curious and adventurous 爱冒险的.

He liked to tinker 摆弄 and build, focusing on clocks and military machinery 军事机械 and the deployment 部署 of his toy soldiers 玩具士兵, and he was fascinated by 着迷于 Western Europe.

In fact, he set off 出发 in 1697 to see what western rulers were up to 在做什么.

The Dutch in particular 尤其 attracted him.

You may remember that they were advanced in canal-building 运河建造 and fire control 消防 and architecture 建筑 and urban lighting 城市照明, and also had lots of money from trading 贸易.

And having seen all these enterprises 企业 in action 运作, Peter returned from Western Europe full of determination 决心 to modernize 使现代化 and westernize 使西方化 Russia.

While Peter was still in Western Europe in the spring of 1698, the Streltsy 射击军 -- a band of infantrymen 步兵 first initiated by 由…创立 Ivan the Terrible (awesome) -- rose up against 奋起反抗 the bad conditions that they faced.

They had hopes of reviving 恢复 the administration 管理 of the regent Sophia, who at the time was imprisoned 监禁.

Peter ordered them crushed 镇压, and when he returned to Russia in August of 1698, he had hundreds of the Streltsy tortured 折磨, exiled 流放, or executed 处决.

The purge 清洗 of the Streltsy actually helped clear the way for 为…扫清道路 the modern fighting force 现代战斗力量 that Peter envisioned 设想.

A major innovation 创新 was giving Russia a standing army 常备军 that ultimately 最终 included some 200,000 recruits 新兵, which was a massive number for Europe at the time.

And systematic training 系统训练 of that army, as well as modernization of weaponry 武器装备现代化, ultimately paid off 取得成功 when it came to battling Sweden.

At first, during an early battle of the Great Northern War 大北方战争, the ambitious 有野心的 and land-hungry 渴望土地的 ruler of Sweden, Charles XII, defeated Russian forces at Narva in 1700.

Hold on a second 等一下 -- Sweden had 12 kings named Charles?

History never ceases to surprise 令人惊讶, my friends.

Right?

So Swedish Charles XII also defeated Poland in the war, but then Peter fortified 加强 his army even more and formed an important alliance 联盟.

He built a coalition 联盟 of Denmark and Poland that ultimately conquered Sweden in 1721 and ended its continental influence 大陆影响力.

As a result of this victory, Russia obtained 获得 Sweden's continental territory 大陆领土, including Estonia 爱沙尼亚 and Livonia 利沃尼亚.

Sweden had gone from being a rescuer 救助者 in the Thirty Years' War 三十年战争 to being almost entirely stuck in 困在 Scandinavia 斯堪的纳维亚, where they would go on to engage in 参与 fewer wars and instead build a state with among the world's lowest poverty rates 贫困率 and highest life expectancy 预期寿命.

The fools.

All right, back to Russia.

Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

During these years, Peter was also building a European-style city with an outlet 出口 to the Baltic 波罗的海 called -- you'll never guess it -- St. Petersburg 圣彼得堡.

Tens of thousands of serfs 农奴 were commandeered 征用 from aristocrats' workforces 劳动力 to build the new city at a great cost in lives 付出巨大的生命代价.

The marshy 沼泽的 site 地点 needed to be entirely reclaimed 开垦 through the building of canals -- you'll remember Peter's admiration for 钦佩 Amsterdam -- and he ordered museums and libraries and universities and stately government buildings 庄严的政府建筑 to adorn 装饰 the city.

His aristocratic subjects 贵族臣民 were ordered to build lavish houses 奢华的房屋 and to hold social events 社交活动 like dances.

Peter also saw the city as the backdrop 背景 for the reform of women's role in society.

They were to leave seclusion 隐居 and appear at public events 公开活动.

Peter decreed 颁布 the end to veiling 戴面纱 for women and an end to dresses or caftans 长袍 for boyars 波雅尔（旧时沙俄的贵族） -- that is, men in the old aristocracy 旧贵族.

Further reforms aimed to develop his middle- and upper-class subjects 中上层阶级臣民 as modern thinkers 现代思想家, especially in math and the sciences.

To remain in the aristocratic ranks 贵族阶层, for instance, sons had to study math, science, or engineering 工程学.

Also requirements for serving as officers 军官 in the military.

Peter founded 创办 schools, including military schools 军事学校, to teach these subjects, and additional schools to teach women reading and writing and other skills.

And unlike earlier Russian rulers, Peter embraced 接纳 foreigners -- not just their canal-building and lamp-lighting, but also their manners 礼仪 and fashion 时尚.

Thanks, Thought Bubble.

So Peter also ended the practice of men wearing beards 胡须.

Did the center of the world just open?

They weren't easy to see back there, but it's Stan's favorite joke: the old stick-on mustache 假胡子 movie magic.

How do I look, Stan?

You would say that.

I once tried to... uh... do this in... uh... when I was shaving my beard, and I came downstairs to show my wife, and she said -- and I'm going to quote her directly 直接引用 -- "No."

So in Peter's Russia, you had to shave your beard so that you could be like a modern, proper European person.

But just as in Elizabeth I and Henry VIII's England, you could pay a tax to keep your beard.

And listen, I don't like to get political on this show, but if we reinstituted 重新制定 that tax, the cities of New York and Portland would pay for healthcare for everyone.

So despite his move toward the rational 理性的 and refined 文雅的 and clean-shaven 不留胡须的, Peter himself could be rough 粗暴的, crude 粗鲁的, heartless 无情的, and violent 暴力的 -- that is, the complete opposite of the kind of citizen he wanted to populate 居住于 his kingdom.

And that is a lesson we keep learning over and over in history: paradox 矛盾现象 is not unusual.

As for serfs, their lives became more difficult as new regulations 规定 meant to attract aristocratic loyalty 贵族忠诚 gave them fewer rights.

Serfs were stripped of 剥夺 the right to move from the noble estate 贵族庄园 where they worked.

Most lived precarious lives 朝不保夕的生活 and were subjected to 遭受 landowners' brutality 地主的残暴.

They had little recourse 追索权 to protect themselves from abuse 虐待 and were forced to work in extremely difficult conditions.

Most serfs did manual 体力的 or agricultural labor 农业劳动, but some became highly skilled artisans 技艺高超的工匠 to embellish 美化 life for the upper classes, creating intricate 复杂精细的 cabinetry 橱柜 or music or paintings.

Some noble families even rented out 出租 their artist serfs or sent them touring 巡回演出 to bring in funds 赚取资金 with their accomplishments 成就.

These traveling serfs helped connect far-flung 遥远的 Russians to one another through paintings of distant cities or landscapes or notable people 名人, for example.

And peasant song 农民歌曲 also eventually found its way into 融入 Russian classical music 古典音乐 as it developed in the 19th century.

But to be clear, Peter's modernization 现代化 did not mean increased protection or power for the most vulnerable 弱势群体, which raises a question: does modernization generally result in 导致 protection or power for the most vulnerable?

Should it?

And can we even generalize about 概括 what it means to be modern when there is so much variety 多样性 just on this one continent -- or arguably 可以说 subcontinent?

So the time of Tsar Peter had massively different effects depending on where you stood.

Some people were learning more about science or art than they'd ever been able to before.

Others were bound to land 被束缚在土地上 or lost their lives in the construction of St. Petersburg.

History is not just about what happened, but also about where you sit 所处的位置.

Are you a boyar's son learning new mathematical discoveries, or a peasant born to a fate of hard labor you can never escape?

The other rising eastern kingdom during this time was the house of Brandenburg-Prussia -- a bird with an arm?

Stan informs me that Brandenburg-Prussia was actually headed by 由…领导 the Hohenzollern family 霍亨索伦家族.

It grew over the centuries from a tiny holding 领地 to an extensive kingdom 庞大的王国, albeit 尽管 one that was initially 最初 landlocked 内陆的.

Okay, so I'm going to need you to brace yourselves 做好准备, because many Fredericks are coming.

It's going to be a little confusing 令人困惑的, but we will get through this together.

The first one to know about is the Great Elector Frederick William 大选帝侯腓特烈·威廉, who was one of the seven electors 选帝侯 of the Holy Roman Empire 神圣罗马帝国.

He worked to keep his territories 领土 together in the closing days 末期 of the Thirty Years' War and to protect them from attack by Sweden in the 1650s.

But as Sweden started to weaken, Poland gave its dependent 附属的 Prussia the status of kingdom 王国地位, and the title of king of that new kingdom went to the aforementioned 上述的 Great Elector Frederick William, and then later to his son Frederick III.

At that point, Frederick III became known as King Frederick I of Prussia 普鲁士国王腓特烈一世, because, you know, it wasn't already confusing enough.

Anyway, as a ruler, Frederick I was something of a connoisseur 鉴赏家 of all the fine things that were coming to characterize 成为…的特征 increasingly affluent 富裕的 and worldly 世故的 European monarchs 君主, while his son, King Frederick William I -- I wish I was kidding -- was quite the opposite.

The Hohenzollern kings, who, like the Romanovs of Russia, ruled into the 20th century, created very strong institutions 制度, beginning with the Great Elector Frederick William in the 17th century.

The military was especially important to Prussia's survival and growth.

He understood that Brandenburg-Prussia's lack of natural boundaries 天然边界 made it really vulnerable to 易受…攻击 those wanting to expand their territory, which in the 17th century was everyone.

So state-building in Prussia involved fortifying 加强 its borders.

A strong military isn't the only way to stabilize power 稳定权力, but it certainly is a way.

Additionally 此外, the Great Elector Frederick William weakened 削弱 the representative bodies 代表机构, or estates general 等级议会, through which the nobility had its say in the kingdom's running 王国的管理.

But to make up for it 弥补这一点, the monarchs 君主 allowed the nobility to intensify 加强 their grip on 控制 peasant lives -- very similar to what happened in Russia.

That, by the way, is called "reenserfment" 再农奴化, which means additional regulations that tighten serf obligations 义务 to their lords 领主.

It happened often and in many places: monarchs would give noble families greater power over ordinary people's labor 劳动 in exchange for 以换取 the nobles giving greater service to the kingdom's military and administration 管理.

The strategy of power consolidation 权力巩固, by the way, still happens: the most powerful placate 安抚 the less powerful by giving them control over the least powerful.

The Great Elector's grandson, King Frederick William I, made the Prussian army 普鲁士军队 the most modern in Europe.

He created a branch of government 政府部门 called the General Directory 总执行局 that oversaw 监督 the operation 运作 of the kingdom to the benefit of the army, raising taxes and recruiting administrators 行政人员 and soldiers.

And Frederick William I sought a certain kind of recruit: specifically 具体来说, giant soldiers -- at least 6 feet in height -- from all across Europe.

He sold off 卖掉 his father's more luxurious possessions 奢华的财产, such as silver and works of art 艺术品, to boost 增强 military strength even more.

Prussia was called "a large army with a small state attached" -- kind of like Russia today.

He's back, isn't he?

He's just... he's very subtle 隐晦的, but I can... I can feel his presence 存在.

One of the weirdnesses 怪异之处 of building a state or an empire is that in order for it to work 运转, you must convince both those outside of your borders and those within them that your state is really real and also really powerful.

States do this partly through treaties 条约, partly through state-building exercises 国家建设活动 like national anthems 国歌 and national histories, and partly by building structures within the state -- armies, government apparatuses 政府机构, statewide laws 全州性法律 -- that strengthen the state and make it less vulnerable to attack.

And the rising monarchies 君主制 of Russia and Prussia were very effective at state-building, which would allow them to shape the future of Europe as a whole 整体, and also aid in 有助于 the final demise 灭亡 of Poland-Lithuania over the 18th century.

Poland-Lithuania failed in part because its constitutional system 宪法制度 failed.

The nobility wielded power 行使权力 instead of fortifying 加强 government institutions like Russia and Prussia had.

And because of the ways Prussia and Russia organized political power, that wasn't as much of a problem in their kingdoms.

There were problems, of course, which would eventually prove catastrophic 灾难性的, and we'll get there eventually.

But first, things are about to get a bit brighter around here, because next time we get to turn our attention to the Enlightenment 启蒙运动.

Thanks for watching.

I'll see you then.

大家好，我是约翰·格林，这里是《速成欧洲史》。

在上一集中，我们看到哈布斯堡家族（Habsburgs）在罗马尼亚人（Romanians）和其他一些人的帮助下，将奥斯曼人（Ottomans）赶出了东欧（Eastern Europe）的大片地区，这开启了哈布斯堡家族向东的扩张。

但在17世纪，还有一些其他重要的国家也在采取重大行动。
今天我们将重点关注其中的两个：俄罗斯（Russia），它在经历了一段动荡时期后寻求稳定；以及勃兰登堡 - 普鲁士（Brandenburg-Prussia）公国，这个小国家在两个世纪内将发展成为极其强大的势力。

[音乐]

在庞大的俄罗斯帝国，沙皇彼得一世（Tsar Peter I）首先成为了一位身形高大的君主——真的是字面意义上的高大。
他身高6英尺9英寸，这……呃……大概是3米吧？
是的，自信点说，格林：“他身高3米。”
可别在考试的时候这么写。

在彼得早年，他的未来看起来并不是特别有希望。
他出生于1672年，并非俄罗斯王位的第一顺位继承人。
当时，他同父异母的姐姐索菲亚（Sophia）作为年轻的罗曼诺夫（Romanov）兄弟的摄政王统治着俄罗斯，彼得是兄弟中最年幼的。
索菲亚想成为终身统治者，但彼得和他的支持者们另有想法。
当时，俄罗斯的许多利益集团都对最终谁能掌握政治权力产生了影响，其中包括东正教（Orthodox Church）、军队、贵族和富有的商人。
随着彼得和他的兄弟们成年，这些集团通过协商达成了对沙皇候选人的共识，然后可以说，俄罗斯人民必须通过公开的欢呼和认可来敲定此事，这在统治者和被统治者之间建立起了神圣的信任。
简而言之，这个君主制国家的政治权力并非简单的“沙皇拥有一切权力”。
彼得是在他的顾问们的帮助以及俄罗斯强大利益集团的支持下才成为沙皇的。
他成为了一名专制统治者，但这种专制与广泛的——当然并非全民的——俄罗斯民众支持交织在一起。
我想说的是，政府与被统治者之间的关系总是复杂的，俄罗斯君主制的例子之所以重要，部分原因在于它让我们看到，即使是专制政府也只有得到外部机构和个人的支持才能维持其权力。

现在，彼得着手处理国家建设的各个方面。
他重组了军队和贵族阶层，在这个过程中也重新调整了谁拥有政治权力以及他们如何行使权力。
对于贵族，他制定了精确的官阶表，每晋升到更高的官阶都取决于贵族为国家提供的服务。
这项改革旨在终结基于人脉关系、任人唯亲和偏袒的旧有政治做法，而是让贵族阶层更趋向于任人唯贤。
彼得还通过让俄罗斯东正教牧首（patriarch）职位空缺，并设立由世俗人士组成的议会（或称元老院，Senate）作为监督机构——当然由沙皇领导，从而消除了牧首的权力。

彼得也充满好奇心且富有冒险精神。
他喜欢捣鼓和制造东西，专注于时钟、军事机械以及他的玩具士兵的部署，并且他对西欧（Western Europe）着迷。
事实上，他在1697年出发去看看西方的统治者们在做些什么。
荷兰人（Dutch）尤其吸引他。
你们可能还记得，他们在运河建造、火灾控制、建筑和城市照明方面都很先进，而且通过贸易赚了很多钱。
见识了所有这些实际运作的企业后，彼得从西欧回来时满怀决心，要让俄罗斯实现现代化并西化。

1698年春天，彼得还在西欧的时候，射击军（Streltsy）——一支最初由“恐怖的伊凡”（Ivan the Terrible）组建的步兵部队（真了不起）——因他们所面临的恶劣条件而发动了起义。
他们希望恢复当时被囚禁的摄政王索菲亚的统治。
彼得下令镇压他们，1698年8月他回到俄罗斯后，对数百名射击军士兵进行了折磨、流放或处决。
对射击军的清洗实际上为彼得设想的现代战斗力量扫清了道路。
一项重大创新是为俄罗斯建立了一支常备军，最终这支军队招募了约20万名士兵，这在当时的欧洲是一个庞大的数字。
对这支军队的系统训练以及武器的现代化，最终在与瑞典（Sweden）的战斗中得到了回报。
起初，在大北方战争（Great Northern War）的早期一场战斗中，野心勃勃、渴望土地的瑞典统治者查理十二世（Charles XII）于1700年在纳尔瓦（Narva）击败了俄罗斯军队。
等一下——瑞典有12个叫查理（Charles）的国王吗？
历史总是充满惊喜，朋友们。
对吧？

所以瑞典的查理十二世在战争中也打败了波兰（Poland），但后来彼得进一步加强了他的军队，并建立了一个重要的联盟。
他组建了由丹麦（Denmark）和波兰组成的联盟，最终在1721年征服了瑞典，结束了瑞典在欧洲大陆的影响力。
这场胜利的结果是，俄罗斯获得了瑞典在欧洲大陆的领土，包括爱沙尼亚（Estonia）和利沃尼亚（Livonia）。
瑞典从三十年战争（Thirty Years' War）中的拯救者，变成了几乎完全困守在斯堪的纳维亚半岛（Scandinavia），在那里他们将减少战争，转而建立一个拥有世界上贫困率最低和预期寿命最高的国家。
这些傻瓜。

好的，回到俄罗斯。
让我们进入“思想泡泡”环节。

在这些年里，彼得还在建造一座通往波罗的海（Baltic）的欧式城市，它的名字——你们绝对猜不到——圣彼得堡（St. Petersburg）。
数以万计的农奴被从贵族的劳动力中征调出来建造这座新城市，付出了巨大的生命代价。
这片沼泽地需要通过修建运河来完全开垦——你们还记得彼得对阿姆斯特丹（Amsterdam）的钦佩之情——他下令建造博物馆、图书馆、大学和庄严的政府建筑来装点这座城市。
他命令他的贵族臣民建造奢华的房屋，并举办像舞会这样的社交活动。
彼得还将这座城市视为改革女性社会角色的背景。
她们要走出隐居生活，出现在公共活动中。
彼得颁布法令，结束女性戴面纱的习俗，以及结束波雅尔（boyars，即旧贵族中的男性）穿长袍或束腰长袍的习俗。
进一步的改革旨在将他的中上层阶级臣民培养成现代思想家，尤其是在数学和科学领域。
例如，为了保持贵族身份，贵族子弟必须学习数学、科学或工程学。
这也是担任军队军官的要求。
彼得创办了学校，包括军事学校，来教授这些学科，还创办了更多学校来教女性阅读、写作和其他技能。
与早期的俄罗斯统治者不同，彼得接纳外国人——不仅是他们的运河建造和照明技术，还有他们的礼仪和时尚。

感谢“思想泡泡”！

所以彼得还废除了男性留胡子的习俗。
世界的中心是不是又打开了？
在后面不太容易看到，但这是斯坦（Stan）最喜欢的笑话：那种老式的粘贴式小胡子，电影里的小把戏。
我看起来怎么样，斯坦？
你肯定会这么说。
有一次我试着……呃……这么做……呃……当我在刮胡子的时候，然后我下楼给我妻子看，她直接说——我直接引用她的话——“不行。”

所以在彼得统治下的俄罗斯，你必须刮掉胡子，这样才能成为一个现代、得体的欧洲人。
但就像在伊丽莎白一世（Elizabeth I）和亨利八世（Henry VIII）统治下的英格兰（England）一样，你可以交税来保留你的胡子。
听着，我不想在这个节目里谈论政治，但如果我们重新征收那个税，纽约（New York）和波特兰（Portland）的城市税收就能为所有人支付医疗费用了。

所以，尽管彼得朝着理性、高雅和不留胡须的方向努力，但他自己却可能粗暴、粗俗、无情且暴力——这与他希望在他的王国里培养的那种公民完全相反。
这是我们在历史中反复学到的一个教训：矛盾并不罕见。

至于农奴，他们的生活变得更加艰难，因为旨在吸引贵族忠诚的新规定使他们的权利更少了。
农奴被剥夺了离开他们工作的贵族庄园的权利。
大多数农奴过着朝不保夕的生活，还遭受着地主的残暴对待。
他们几乎没有办法保护自己免受虐待，并且被迫在极其艰苦的条件下工作。
大多数农奴从事体力劳动或农业劳动，但有些成为了技艺高超的工匠，为上层阶级的生活增添光彩，制作精美的橱柜、音乐或绘画。
一些贵族家庭甚至出租他们的农奴艺术家，或者送他们巡回演出，用他们的成就赚取收入。
例如，这些四处游历的农奴通过描绘遥远的城市、风景或名人的画作，帮助相隔甚远的俄罗斯人相互了解。
而且农民歌曲最终也融入了19世纪发展起来的俄罗斯古典音乐中。

但需要明确的是，彼得的现代化并不意味着为最弱势群体提供更多的保护或权力，这就提出了一个问题：现代化通常会为最弱势群体带来保护或权力吗？
它应该这样吗？
当仅仅在这一个大陆——或者可以说是次大陆上就有如此多的多样性时，我们甚至能对现代化的含义进行一概而论吗？

所以沙皇彼得时代的影响因个人所处的立场而大不相同。
一些人比以往任何时候都更多地学习了科学或艺术知识。
而另一些人则被束缚在土地上，或者在圣彼得堡的建设中失去了生命。
历史不仅仅是关于发生了什么，还关乎你的立场。
你是一个学习新数学发现的波雅尔之子，还是一个生来就注定要从事艰苦劳动且无法逃脱的农民呢？

在这个时期另一个崛起的东部王国是勃兰登堡 - 普鲁士公国——一只长着胳膊的鸟？
斯坦告诉我，勃兰登堡 - 普鲁士实际上是由霍亨索伦家族（Hohenzollern family）统治的。
几个世纪以来，它从一个小小的领地发展成为一个幅员辽阔的王国，尽管最初它是一个内陆国家。

好的，所以我需要你们做好准备，因为接下来会出现很多叫腓特烈（Frederick）的人。
可能会有点混乱，但我们会一起理清的。
首先要知道的是“大选帝侯”腓特烈·威廉（Frederick William），他是神圣罗马帝国（Holy Roman Empire）的七位选帝侯之一。
在三十年战争的最后日子里，他努力维持自己领地的统一，并在17世纪50年代保护领地免受瑞典的攻击。
但随着瑞典开始衰落，波兰给予其附属的普鲁士王国地位，这个新王国的国王头衔先是给了前面提到的“大选帝侯”腓特烈·威廉，后来又给了他的儿子腓特烈三世（Frederick III）。
在那个时候，腓特烈三世被称为普鲁士国王腓特烈一世（King Frederick I of Prussia），因为，你懂的，这还不够让人困惑似的。

不管怎样，作为一个统治者，腓特烈一世有点像是各种美好事物的鉴赏家，这些美好事物越来越成为富裕且世俗的欧洲君主的特征，而他的儿子，国王腓特烈·威廉一世（King Frederick William I）——我希望我是在开玩笑——则完全相反。
霍亨索伦家族的国王们，就像俄罗斯的罗曼诺夫家族一样，统治一直持续到20世纪，从17世纪的“大选帝侯”腓特烈·威廉开始，他们建立了非常强大的制度。
军队对普鲁士的生存和发展尤为重要。
他明白勃兰登堡 - 普鲁士缺乏天然边界，这使得它很容易受到那些想要扩张领土的人的攻击，而在17世纪，人人都想扩张领土。
所以普鲁士的国家建设包括巩固其边界。
强大的军队并不是稳定权力的唯一途径，但肯定是一种途径。

此外，“大选帝侯”腓特烈·威廉削弱了代表机构，即三级会议（estates general），贵族曾通过这个机构在王国的治理中发表意见。
但作为补偿，君主们允许贵族加强对农民生活的控制——这与俄罗斯发生的情况非常相似。
顺便说一下，这被称为“再农奴化”（reenserfment），意思是额外的规定加强了农奴对领主的义务。
这种情况经常在许多地方发生：君主们会给予贵族家庭对普通人劳动的更大权力，以换取贵族为王国的军事和行政管理提供更多服务。
顺便说一下，巩固权力的策略现在仍然存在：最有权势的人通过让次一级有权势的人控制最弱势群体来安抚他们。

“大选帝侯”的孙子，国王腓特烈·威廉一世，使普鲁士军队成为了欧洲最现代化的军队。
他创建了一个名为总执行局（General Directory）的政府部门，负责监督王国的运作，以利于军队，包括提高税收、招募行政人员和士兵。
腓特烈·威廉一世寻找特定类型的新兵：具体来说，是来自欧洲各地的高大士兵——至少6英尺高。
他卖掉了他父亲更奢华的财产，比如银器和艺术品，以进一步增强军事力量。
普鲁士被称为“一支庞大的军队附属着一个小国家”——有点像今天的俄罗斯。
他又出现了，是吗？
他只是……他很隐蔽，但我能……我能感觉到他的存在。

建立一个国家或帝国的奇怪之处之一在于，为了使其运转，你必须让边境之外和境内的人都相信你的国家是真实存在的，并且非常强大。
国家通过部分条约、部分通过诸如国歌和国家历史等国家建设活动，以及部分通过在国内建立军队、政府机构、全国性法律等结构来实现这一点，这些结构可以加强国家并使其更不容易受到攻击。

俄罗斯和普鲁士崛起的君主制在国家建设方面非常有效，这将使它们能够塑造整个欧洲的未来，也有助于在18世纪最终导致波兰立陶宛联邦（Poland-Lithuania）的灭亡。
波兰立陶宛联邦的失败部分是因为它的宪法制度失败了。
贵族掌握了权力，而没有像俄罗斯和普鲁士那样巩固政府机构。
并且由于普鲁士和俄罗斯组织政治权力的方式，在它们的王国里这并不是一个大问题。
当然，也存在一些问题，这些问题最终将被证明是灾难性的，我们最终会讲到的。

但首先，这里的情况即将变得更加明朗一些，因为下次我们将把注意力转向启蒙运动（Enlightenment）。

感谢观看。

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

So in our last episode, we saw the Habsburgs, with the help of Romanians and some others, drive the Ottomans out of large swaths of Eastern Europe, which started the Habsburg expansion eastward.

But there were some other important states making big moves during the 17th century.

Today we're going to focus on two of them: Russia, which sought stability after a time of troubles, and the house of Brandenburg-Prussia, a small state that within two centuries would grow to become extraordinarily powerful.

[Music]

In the huge Russian Empire, Tsar Peter I first became an outsized monarch -- literally.

He was 6'9" tall, which is... uh... like 3 m?

Yeah, just say with authority, Green: "He was 3 m tall."

Don't write that on your tests.

Now, early in Peter's life, his future didn't look particularly promising.

He was born in 1672, and he was not first in line to the Russian throne.

His half-sister Sophia was ruling Russia at the time as regent for the young Romanov brothers, of whom Peter was the youngest.

Sophia wanted to become the permanent ruler, but Peter and his supporters had other ideas.

At the time, many interest groups in Russia helped shape who ended up with political power, including the Orthodox Church, the army, the aristocracy, and wealthy traders.

And as Peter and his brothers came of age, these groups negotiated to arrive at a consensus candidate for tsar, and then the Russian people had to seal the deal, so to speak, via public demonstrations of acclaim and approval, which developed the sacred trust between the ruler and the ruled.

In short, political power in this monarchy was not as simple as "the tsar has all of it."

And Peter only became tsar with the help of his advisers and the support of powerful interest groups in Russia.

He became an autocratic ruler, but the autocracy was intertwined with widespread -- if certainly not universal -- public support from the Russian people.

What I'm getting at is that the relationship between the government and the governed is always complex, and the example of the Russian monarchy is important partly because it helps us to see that even absolutist governments could only retain their power by having support from outside institutions and individuals.

Now, Peter tackled every facet of state-building.

He reorganized both the military and the nobility, and in doing so also reorganized who had political power and how they could wield it.

For the nobility, he created a precise table of ranks, with each promotion to a higher rank depending on the aristocrat performing service to the state.

This reform aimed to end older political practices based on networking and nepotism and favoritism, and instead make the aristocracy more of a meritocracy.

Peter also eliminated the power of the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church by leaving the post vacant and setting up a council, or Senate, of laypeople as overseers, headed, of course, by the tsar.

Peter was also curious and adventurous.

He liked to tinker and build, focusing on clocks and military machinery and the deployment of his toy soldiers, and he was fascinated by Western Europe.

In fact, he set off in 1697 to see what western rulers were up to.

The Dutch in particular attracted him.

You may remember that they were advanced in canal-building and fire control and architecture and urban lighting, and also had lots of money from trading.

And having seen all these enterprises in action, Peter returned from Western Europe full of determination to modernize and westernize Russia.

While Peter was still in Western Europe in the spring of 1698, the Streltsy -- a band of infantrymen first initiated by Ivan the Terrible (awesome) -- rose up against the bad conditions that they faced.

They had hopes of reviving the administration of the regent Sophia, who at the time was imprisoned.

Peter ordered them crushed, and when he returned to Russia in August of 1698, he had hundreds of the Streltsy tortured, exiled, or executed.

The purge of the Streltsy actually helped clear the way for the modern fighting force that Peter envisioned.

A major innovation was giving Russia a standing army that ultimately included some 200,000 recruits, which was a massive number for Europe at the time.

And systematic training of that army, as well as modernization of weaponry, ultimately paid off when it came to battling Sweden.

At first, during an early battle of the Great Northern War, the ambitious and land-hungry ruler of Sweden, Charles XII, defeated Russian forces at Narva in 1700.

Hold on a second -- Sweden had 12 kings named Charles?

History never ceases to surprise, my friends.

Right?

So Swedish Charles XII also defeated Poland in the war, but then Peter fortified his army even more and formed an important alliance.

He built a coalition of Denmark and Poland that ultimately conquered Sweden in 1721 and ended its continental influence.

As a result of this victory, Russia obtained Sweden's continental territory, including Estonia and Livonia.

Sweden had gone from being a rescuer in the Thirty Years' War to being almost entirely stuck in Scandinavia, where they would go on to engage in fewer wars and instead build a state with among the world's lowest poverty rates and highest life expectancy.

The fools.

All right, back to Russia.

Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

During these years, Peter was also building a European-style city with an outlet to the Baltic called -- you'll never guess it -- St. Petersburg.

Tens of thousands of serfs were commandeered from aristocrats' workforces to build the new city at a great cost in lives.

The marshy site needed to be entirely reclaimed through the building of canals -- you'll remember Peter's admiration for Amsterdam -- and he ordered museums and libraries and universities and stately government buildings to adorn the city.

His aristocratic subjects were ordered to build lavish houses and to hold social events like dances.

Peter also saw the city as the backdrop for the reform of women's role in society.

They were to leave seclusion and appear at public events.

Peter decreed the end to veiling for women and an end to dresses or caftans for boyars -- that is, men in the old aristocracy.

Further reforms aimed to develop his middle- and upper-class subjects as modern thinkers, especially in math and the sciences.

To remain in the aristocratic ranks, for instance, sons had to study math, science, or engineering.

Also requirements for serving as officers in the military.

Peter founded schools, including military schools, to teach these subjects, and additional schools to teach women reading and writing and other skills.

And unlike earlier Russian rulers, Peter embraced foreigners -- not just their canal-building and lamp-lighting, but also their manners and fashion.

Thanks, Thought Bubble.

So Peter also ended the practice of men wearing beards.

Did the center of the world just open?

They weren't easy to see back there, but it's Stan's favorite joke: the old stick-on mustache movie magic.

How do I look, Stan?

You would say that.

I once tried to... uh... do this in... uh... when I was shaving my beard, and I came downstairs to show my wife, and she said -- and I'm going to quote her directly -- "No."

So in Peter's Russia, you had to shave your beard so that you could be like a modern, proper European person.

But just as in Elizabeth I and Henry VIII's England, you could pay a tax to keep your beard.

And listen, I don't like to get political on this show, but if we reinstituted that tax, the cities of New York and Portland would pay for healthcare for everyone.

So despite his move toward the rational and refined and clean-shaven, Peter himself could be rough, crude, heartless, and violent -- that is, the complete opposite of the kind of citizen he wanted to populate his kingdom.

And that is a lesson we keep learning over and over in history: paradox is not unusual.

As for serfs, their lives became more difficult as new regulations meant to attract aristocratic loyalty gave them fewer rights.

Serfs were stripped of the right to move from the noble estate where they worked.

Most lived precarious lives and were subjected to landowners' brutality.

They had little recourse to protect themselves from abuse and were forced to work in extremely difficult conditions.

Most serfs did manual or agricultural labor, but some became highly skilled artisans to embellish life for the upper classes, creating intricate cabinetry or music or paintings.

Some noble families even rented out their artist serfs or sent them touring to bring in funds with their accomplishments.

These traveling serfs helped connect far-flung Russians to one another through paintings of distant cities or landscapes or notable people, for example.

And peasant song also eventually found its way into Russian classical music as it developed in the 19th century.

But to be clear, Peter's modernization did not mean increased protection or power for the most vulnerable, which raises a question: does modernization generally result in protection or power for the most vulnerable?

Should it?

And can we even generalize about what it means to be modern when there is so much variety just on this one continent -- or arguably subcontinent?

So the time of Tsar Peter had massively different effects depending on where you stood.

Some people were learning more about science or art than they'd ever been able to before.

Others were bound to land or lost their lives in the construction of St. Petersburg.

History is not just about what happened, but also about where you sit.

Are you a boyar's son learning new mathematical discoveries, or a peasant born to a fate of hard labor you can never escape?

The other rising eastern kingdom during this time was the house of Brandenburg-Prussia -- a bird with an arm?

Stan informs me that Brandenburg-Prussia was actually headed by the Hohenzollern family.

It grew over the centuries from a tiny holding to an extensive kingdom, albeit one that was initially landlocked.

Okay, so I'm going to need you to brace yourselves, because many Fredericks are coming.

It's going to be a little confusing, but we will get through this together.

The first one to know about is the Great Elector Frederick William, who was one of the seven electors of the Holy Roman Empire.

He worked to keep his territories together in the closing days of the Thirty Years' War and to protect them from attack by Sweden in the 1650s.

But as Sweden started to weaken, Poland gave its dependent Prussia the status of kingdom, and the title of king of that new kingdom went to the aforementioned Great Elector Frederick William, and then later to his son Frederick III.

At that point, Frederick III became known as King Frederick I of Prussia, because, you know, it wasn't already confusing enough.

Anyway, as a ruler, Frederick I was something of a connoisseur of all the fine things that were coming to characterize increasingly affluent and worldly European monarchs, while his son, King Frederick William I -- I wish I was kidding -- was quite the opposite.

The Hohenzollern kings, who, like the Romanovs of Russia, ruled into the 20th century, created very strong institutions, beginning with the Great Elector Frederick William in the 17th century.

The military was especially important to Prussia's survival and growth.

He understood that Brandenburg-Prussia's lack of natural boundaries made it really vulnerable to those wanting to expand their territory, which in the 17th century was everyone.

So state-building in Prussia involved fortifying its borders.

A strong military isn't the only way to stabilize power, but it certainly is a way.

Additionally, the Great Elector Frederick William weakened the representative bodies, or estates general, through which the nobility had its say in the kingdom's running.

But to make up for it, the monarchs allowed the nobility to intensify their grip on peasant lives -- very similar to what happened in Russia.

That, by the way, is called "reenserfment," which means additional regulations that tighten serf obligations to their lords.

It happened often and in many places: monarchs would give noble families greater power over ordinary people's labor in exchange for the nobles giving greater service to the kingdom's military and administration.

The strategy of power consolidation, by the way, still happens: the most powerful placate the less powerful by giving them control over the least powerful.

The Great Elector's grandson, King Frederick William I, made the Prussian army the most modern in Europe.

He created a branch of government called the General Directory that oversaw the operation of the kingdom to the benefit of the army, raising taxes and recruiting administrators and soldiers.

And Frederick William I sought a certain kind of recruit: specifically, giant soldiers -- at least 6 feet in height -- from all across Europe.

He sold off his father's more luxurious possessions, such as silver and works of art, to boost military strength even more.

Prussia was called "a large army with a small state attached" -- kind of like Russia today.

He's back, isn't he?

He's just... he's very subtle, but I can... I can feel his presence.

One of the weirdnesses of building a state or an empire is that in order for it to work, you must convince both those outside of your borders and those within them that your state is really real and also really powerful.

States do this partly through treaties, partly through state-building exercises like national anthems and national histories, and partly by building structures within the state -- armies, government apparatuses, statewide laws -- that strengthen the state and make it less vulnerable to attack.

And the rising monarchies of Russia and Prussia were very effective at state-building, which would allow them to shape the future of Europe as a whole, and also aid in the final demise of Poland-Lithuania over the 18th century.

Poland-Lithuania failed in part because its constitutional system failed.

The nobility wielded power instead of fortifying government institutions like Russia and Prussia had.

And because of the ways Prussia and Russia organized political power, that wasn't as much of a problem in their kingdoms.

There were problems, of course, which would eventually prove catastrophic, and we'll get there eventually.

But first, things are about to get a bit brighter around here, because next time we get to turn our attention to the Enlightenment.

Thanks for watching.

I'll see you then.
