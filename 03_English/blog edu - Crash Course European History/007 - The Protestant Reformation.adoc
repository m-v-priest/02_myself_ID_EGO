Hi, I’m John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

And today, it’s time to find out what else, besides money, was behind the competition between Spain and England as they fought it out on the seas and across the globe after 1550. That’s right, today we get to talk about religion 宗教.

As you may know, the Internet is terrible at engaging in nuanced 细致的 and thoughtful conversations about religion. But if you think our contemporary 当代的 religious discourse 论述 is bad, just wait until you get a load of 16th-century Europe.

**INTRO**
Okay, so over the centuries, the Catholic Church had developed a powerful structure under the papal monarchy 教皇君主制. Its courts, religious law, local priests, and a huge bureaucracy 官僚体系 of religious officials enforced its domination 统治. And Catholic ideas of the time backed up social and political inequality: for example, Church teachings described monarchs 君主 and noble people as closer to God than ordinary people. It also had ideas about how the universe worked and sought to repress 压制 those whose ideas were different, as we’ll discuss further when we turn our attention to the Scientific Revolution. But in general, Catholic domination of so many aspects of life produced so much resistance 抵抗 beginning in the early 16th century that European Christianity eventually split into two, and then split into like 17,000 competing subgroups.

It all starts with Martin Luther—a bright young German man whose father wanted him to become a lawyer, as so many fathers do. So Martin Luther went to law school. But his real concern, even after getting his law degree, was salvation 救赎, so he became a devout 虔诚的 monk. Still though, he was agitated 焦虑的, worried about salvation generally and specifically about Church teachings that faith and good works were needed to achieve salvation. For Luther, doing good works seemed a bit like bribery 贿赂; like, wasn’t full faith in God the important thing? This kind of thinking meant that Luther was on his way to heresy 异端邪说—that is, beliefs that went against the principles of the Catholic faith. And the heresy of, for instance, denying the pope’s authority could get you burned at the stake 火刑柱, as John Hus was in 1415.

Now, many of Luther’s objections 反对意见 to Church teachings were highly theological 神学的, concerning beliefs about, say, whether the word "repent" in the Bible can be said to refer to the sacrament 圣礼 of penance 忏悔. But one of Luther’s objections was not nearly that obscure 晦涩的, and was much more relevant to ordinary people. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

Okay, so in Catholic doctrine 教义, there was a state after death called Purgatory 炼狱, a kind of holding place for souls that are not pure enough to ascend 升天 to heaven but not bad enough to go to hell. Souls in purgatory can be purified 净化 by prayers from the living, and also purified by tortuous 折磨人的 afterlife punishment. And in 1517, the pope issued a special indulgence 赎罪券 to raise money to continue building the splendid St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome. Purchasing one of these indulgences was said to release a soul from purgatory—so if you had a deceased 已故的 friend or family member whose sins might not have been totally cleansed 净化 through their faith and good works, you could buy an indulgence and get them a ticket to heaven.

Now, this may sound to you like a naked 公然的 attempt to use people’s worry and grief as a cash grab 敛财. And Luther agreed. Like, one monk who sold indulgences literally said, quote: “Don’t you hear the voices of your dead parents and other relatives crying out, ‘Have mercy on us, for we suffer great punishment and pain. From this, you could release us with a few alms 施舍物. … Why do you treat us so cruelly and leave us to suffer in the flames, when it only takes so little to save us?’” I’m not here to criticize any particular religion, but that is a smidge 稍微 manipulative 操纵性的. It wasn’t only Luther who took offense to this practice. Merchants and artisans 工匠 also noted that it seemed a lot like blackmail 敲诈. Many city-dwellers objected to their hard-earned money going to support the aristocratic 贵族的 children of the wealthy who held high positions in the clergy 神职人员 and lived in luxury without ever having to, you know, earn money.

Thanks, Thought Bubble.

So for Luther, salvation wasn’t something you bought, either by good works or by purchasing indulgences. Instead, he believed in salvation by faith alone and so one should seek to fortify 强化 one’s faith. In 1517, Luther, then in his early thirties, composed “Ninety-Five Theses” expressing questions and differing opinions on these and many other theological issues, perhaps posting them to the door of the chapel of Wittenberg. But in whatever form, his ideas spread. Soon, papal documents and books of canon law 教会法 were being burned by students during protests as earnest 认真的 young Christian humanists vented 发泄 their anger. And Luther’s initial questioning of the Church rapidly became rejection: “For we claim the papacy 教皇职位 not to be the holy Church,” Luther stated, “nor any part of it, and we are unable to cooperate with it.” This rejection of the Church as it operated in the early sixteenth century came to be called the Reformation 宗教改革.

Luther began to take on the entire Church establishment 机构. In European Catholicism at the time, priests were the authority; THEY read the Bible and then told you what it said. But Luther argued that priests, like all people, were themselves sinners 罪人, and that the only true authority was the Bible; it was, he argued, the word of God that provided the relationship with God, not the word of priests. He believed that the hierarchy 等级制度 of priests, and bishops, and cardinals, and the Pope was inherently 本质上 corrupt 腐败的, and that such corrupt individuals could hardly serve as intermediaries 中介 with the divine 神圣的. Sola scriptura 唯独圣经 (Latin: by Scripture alone), only the Bible or scripture, was his motto alongside the keys to salvation: sola gratia 唯独恩典 (by grace alone) and sola fide 唯独信心 (by faith alone), only grace and only faith.

The idea of sola scriptura led to a wide-ranging revolution, especially by boosting reading and individual study. Because suddenly, it was important not just for scholars to learn to read, but for everyone, because the written word of God was the way to God.

Now, at first, authorities didn’t see cause for alarm, although early in 1521 the Pope did excommunicate 逐出教会 Luther. Several months later, Luther was summoned 传唤 before representatives of the Holy Roman Empire at the Diet of Worms 沃尔姆斯议会 (Diet: 议会), which is overwhelmingly the easiest history term to remember because they literally called it the Diet of Worms. Leading the assembly in the town of Worms, Germany was Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.

Oh! Did the globe open? Weird. I don’t get it? I don’t get it, it’s just a can of mixed nuts—what does this have to do with the Diet of Worms? Oh! Stan. Gah. Very frightening. I have a diet...of worms. That’s good stuff, Stan.

Right, but back to Charles V. At the time, Charles was nineteen and ruler of Spain, the Low Countries and Duchy of Burgundy 勃艮第公国. Also, the entire Habsburg Empire 哈布斯堡帝国, Italy, and all the Spanish possessions 领地 in the Western Hemisphere and Southeast Asia, which—if you’ve ever met or been a 19-year-old, you’ll know is a lot of responsibility for someone who can’t legally drink wine in America. Although, on the other hand, he does look like he is 50 in this stained-glass window 彩色玻璃窗 of the Diet of Worms.

Charles’ rulership 统治 of the Holy Roman Empire was gained through the votes of electors 选帝侯, who had selected him from other royal or noble contenders 竞争者. Among them was the elector of Saxony, Frederick the Wise, whom Charles had bribed 贿赂 for his vote. Frederick was religious, but not a fan of the papacy. And many aristocrats 贵族 saw Charles as threatening world domination because, you know, he was dominating a lot of the world.

So when called to account by such a massively powerful ruler, everyone expected that an insignificant 微不足道的 monk like Martin Luther would completely fold 屈服 and admit his errors. But he did not: “I can do no other,” he supposedly said of maintaining his new beliefs. The Holy Roman Emperor declared him an outlaw 逃犯 to be captured. But German princes took his side, and Frederick the Wise hid and protected Luther. Why? Well, that remains one of the unanswered questions of history—maybe it was because Frederick was concerned about papal abuses 教皇的弊端, maybe because Frederick felt Luther couldn’t get a fair trial, and maybe because he felt that Luther and the reform movements he was leading would limit Charles’s power.

Regardless, after Frederick’s death, his brother and successor 继承者 continued to protect Luther and his followers, helping in 1530 to organize the Schmalkaldic League 施马尔卡尔登联盟 of Protestant Princes to protect the Lutherans, which, I mean, as names go, is no Diet of Worms. On the other hand, if Marvel is looking for a new superhero franchise, how about the Schmalkaldic League of Protestant Princes?

Early in the 1520s, Luther wrote tracts 小册子 outlining his beliefs in greater detail. He also translated the New Testament of the Bible into German—that is, the local language or vernacular 白话 instead of elite Latin. And thanks to the printing press, two hundred thousand copies were printed in the 1520s and early 1530s, and many more of his other writings went into print. The Reformation went from being local to being German to being a European-wide movement in large part thanks to the printing press.

Meanwhile, many German princes took up the “Lutheran” challenge to the Holy Roman Emperor. If Charles was against reform, many princes would be for it as a way of restraining 限制 the Holy Roman Emperor’s power. Luther summoned them to defend German values against the corruption found in Rome. And because of that, Luther is sometimes called the source or father of German nationalism 民族主义.

And then, in 1525, peasants and other village folk across southern Germany began protesting—eventually including an estimated 100,000 rioters 暴动者 who sacked 洗劫 castles as well as religious centers. The princes and nobility crushed 镇压 them—they could get behind religious reform, but not mass social change. And Luther agreed, slamming the rioters in *Against the Rioting Peasants*, soon reprinted with the new sensationalist 耸人听闻的 title—*Against the Murderous, Thieving Hordes of Peasants*. So, you know, Luther favored some reform, but not, like, equal rights for peasants reform.

All the while, the reform movement spread—and as it did, it developed offspring 分支. Already in 1519, Ulrich Zwingli, a Swiss priest, began preaching reform in Zurich. He supported Luther’s main criticisms of the papacy, but he disagreed on the Eucharist 圣体圣事, or communion 圣餐, a ritual 仪式 in which worshipers eat bread and drink wine. Or don’t. Depending on your perspective. Catholic doctrine held that through the miracle of transubstantiation 变体论, the bread and wine literally became the body and blood of Jesus Christ; Luther argued for something called consubstantiation 共体论, in which the bread and wine are still bread and wine, yet also the body and blood of Christ. And Zwingli believed Communion only to be a symbolic 象征性的 ritual, in which the bread and wine were just bread and wine.

I know this will seem to many of you like an extremely obscure theological argument that can’t possibly have been important, but it was—these theological questions were not just a matter of life and death; they were a matter of eternal 永恒的 life and death.

Zwingli’s preachings eventually turned some of his followers to a more radical 激进的 interpretation of Christianity. These people were called Anabaptists 再洗礼派, they held that faith was a matter of individual thought and free will. So only a thinking adult could knowingly participate in Christian faith enough to accept Jesus as lord and savior. So they argued that baptism 洗礼, a cleansing 净化 ritual that had long been performed on infants, should only be available to adults who’ve chosen to accept Jesus as savior.

[[TV: Luther Married]] And as reformers increased in number and variety, Luther did something else that was really shocking: in 1525, he got married, even though Catholic clergy were supposed to be celibate 独身的. Luther preached that God made two sexes to procreate 生育 and that the clergy’s celibacy was against the divine plan. So he married Katharina von Bora, a literate 有文化的 young woman who had been in a convent 修道院 since the age of five, and this was controversial 有争议的 even among his supporters. One of Luther’s best friends and admirers lamented 哀叹 that by marrying, Luther “revels 狂欢 and compromises his good reputation precisely at a time when Germany stands in need of his spirit and authority.” But Luther wrote a lot about marriage, and sermonized 布道 about it too for the princes, nobility, and his growing number of followers. One of these “lectures” refers to the story of Adam and Eve as written about in the book of Genesis 创世纪 in the Bible: “Moreover, this designation [woman] carries with it a wonderful and pleasing description of marriage, in which, as the jurist 法学家 says, the wife shines by reason of her husband’s rays.” “Whatever the husband has, this the wife has and possesses in its entirety. . . . the result is that the husband differs from the wife in no respect than in sex...” This certainly wasn’t equality 平等 as we now understand it, what with the wife shining by reason of her husband’s rays, but the notion 观念 of equity 公平 of marital property 婚姻财产 was heresy piled on top of the heresy of clergy marrying.

[[TV: An Appropriate Battle]] All of this led to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V deciding to put down 镇压 the pesky 麻烦的 Protestant princes of the Schmalkaldic League once and for all in 1546 and 1547, and he almost did so. He had vast resources at his disposal 支配, including tough soldiers from the Spanish armies, who defeated the League and captured some leading Protestant princes. And Catholicism appeared to be making a comeback. But then, in 1552, the League suddenly took to the field again, roundly defeating the imperial 帝国的 forces.

[[TV: Peace of Augsburg]] In 1555, the Peace of Augsburg 奥格斯堡和约 decreed 颁布 that whoever ruled would determine the religion of his territory. [[TV Window]] And so communities became Catholic or Protestant based on the religion of their prince.

Phew. We really dodged a religious war bullet—nope, no. The Reformation story was not over. Luther had called Church corruption a “horrid abomination” 可怕的恶行 and its defenders “excrements and vermin” 排泄物和害虫; and those who now entered this titanic 巨大的 religious struggle in other parts of Europe were just as vehement 激烈的, even though following different plots. The finer points of theology continued to divide people, as did the politics of religion and overseas empire. In short, more bloodshed 流血事件 to follow. We’ll take that up next time.

Thanks for watching.

大家好，我是约翰·格林，这里是《速成欧洲史》。

今天我们来探讨一下，除了金钱之外，1550年后西班牙和英国在海上及全球竞争的背后, 还有什么因素。没错，今天我们要谈谈宗教。

你可能知道，互联网在进行关于宗教的细致且有深度的对话方面, 表现糟糕。但**如果你认为我们当代的宗教讨论已经很糟糕了，那就等着看看16世纪的欧洲吧。**

**片头**
好的，几个世纪以来，天主教会在教皇君主制下, 形成了强大的结构。其法庭、宗教法、地方牧师, 以及庞大的宗教官僚体系, 维持着统治。**当时的天主教思想支持"社会和政治不平等"：**例如，*教会教义称, 君主和贵族比普通人更接近上帝*。教会也有关于宇宙运行的观点，**并试图压制那些持有不同观点的人——我们在讨论科学革命时, 会进一步探讨这一点。**但总体而言，*天主教对生活诸多方面的统治, 在16世纪初引发了强烈的反抗，最终导致欧洲基督教分裂为两大阵营，#随后又分裂成约1.7万个相互竞争的分支。#*

这一切都始于**马丁·路德**——一个聪明的德国年轻人，他的父亲和许多父亲一样希望他成为律师。于是马丁·路德进入法学院学习。但即使获得法律学位后，他真正关心的仍是救赎，于是成为了一名虔诚的修士。不过，**他内心焦虑不安，普遍担忧救赎问题，尤其对教会“信仰与善行需兼修, 以获得救赎”的教义存疑。**对路德来说，**行善似乎有点像贿赂；难道"对上帝的全然信仰"不是最重要的吗？**这种想法意味着路德正在走向异端——即违背天主教教义的信仰。例如，**否认教皇权威的异端思想, 可能让你被处以火刑，**就像1415年的约翰·胡斯那样。

路德对教会教义的许多反对意见, 极具神学性，比如涉及《圣经》中“悔改”一词是否指"忏悔圣礼"的信仰问题。但路德的反对意见中有一条并非如此晦涩，且与普通人更为相关。让我们进入“思想泡泡”环节。

好的，**#根据天主教教义，死后有一个名为“炼狱”的状态，这是一个灵魂的暂存之所——灵魂若不够纯净, 便无法升入天堂，但又未邪恶到该下地狱，便会暂居于此。炼狱中灵魂, 可通过"生者的祈祷"净化，也可通过"来世的痛苦"惩罚净化。#**1517年，**教皇发布了一项特殊的“赎罪券”，**以筹集资金继续修建罗马宏伟的圣彼得大教堂。*据称，购买一张赎罪券, 可让灵魂脱离炼狱*——因此，如果你有已故的朋友或家人，*#其罪孽可能未通过"信仰"和"善行"完全洗净，你就可以购买"赎罪券"，为他们买一张通往天堂的门票。#*

这在你听来可能像是"利用人们的担忧和悲痛来捞钱"的露骨企图。路德也持同样看法。例如，**一个售卖赎罪券的修士甚至直白地说：“你没听到你死去的父母和其他亲人的哭声吗？‘可怜可怜我们吧，我们遭受着巨大的惩罚和痛苦。你只需施舍一点，就能把我们救出来……你为何如此残忍地对待我们，让我们在火焰中受苦，而拯救我们只需这么一点代价？’”**我无意批评任何特定宗教，但这确实有点操纵性。并非只有路德反感这种做法。商人和工匠也指出，**这看起来很像敲诈勒索。**许多城市居民反对将自己的血汗钱, 用于供养教会中身居高位的富人家族子弟——这些人过着奢华生活，却从不需要自己谋生。

感谢“思想泡泡”。

因此，**对路德而言，**救赎不是通过善行或购买赎罪券“购买”来的。相反，**#他相信“因信称义”，即人应寻求"强化自身信仰"。#**1517年，三十出头的路德撰写了《九十五条论纲》，表达了对上述及许多其他神学问题的质疑和不同意见，可能将其张贴在了维滕贝格教堂的门上。无论以何种形式，他的思想迅速传播开来。很快，学生们在抗议中, 焚烧教皇文件和教会法书籍，满怀热忱的年轻基督教"人文主义者"借此宣泄愤怒。*路德对教会的最初质疑, 迅速演变为彻底的否定*：“我们认为, 教皇统治并非神圣教会，”路德宣称，“甚至不是其一部分，我们无法与之合作。”*#这种对16世纪初教会运作方式的否定, 后来被称为“宗教改革”。#*

*路德开始挑战整个教会体系。#在当时的欧洲天主教中，牧师是权威；他们阅读《圣经》，然后向信徒阐释其含义。但路德认为，牧师和所有人一样都是罪人，唯一真正的权威是《圣经》；他认为，是上帝的话语提供了与上帝的联系，而非牧师的话语。他相信，由牧师、主教、红衣主教和教皇构成的等级制度, 本质上是腐败的，这样腐败的个体几乎无法作为"与神沟通的中介"。#“唯独圣经”（Sola scriptura）是他的座右铭(即"去中间商")，与之并列的救赎关键是“唯独恩典”（Sola gratia）和“唯独信仰”（Sola fide）。*

*“唯独圣经”的理念引发了一场广泛的革命，尤其推动了阅读和个人研究的普及。因为突然之间，不仅学者需要学习阅读，所有人都需要，因为上帝的文字, 是与神沟通的途径。*

起初，当局并未感到警惕，尽管教皇在1521年初将路德逐出了教会。几个月后，路德被传唤至沃尔姆斯帝国议会，面对神圣罗马帝国的代表。“沃尔姆斯帝国议会”（Diet of Worms）绝对是最容易记住的历史术语，因为他们真的就这么叫它。在德国沃尔姆斯镇主持会议的, 是神圣罗马帝国皇帝查理五世。

哦！地球仪打开了吗？奇怪。我不明白？这只是一罐混合坚果——这和沃尔姆斯帝国议会有什么关系？哦！斯坦。天啊。太吓人了。我有一个“蠕虫食谱”（diet of worms）。干得好，斯坦。

言归正传，回到**查理五世。**当时，19岁的查理统治着西班牙、低地国家和勃艮第公国。此外，还有整个哈布斯堡帝国、意大利，以及西班牙在西半球和东南亚的所有属地——如果你曾认识或成为过19岁的年轻人，就会知道这对一个在美国还不能合法饮酒的这个年龄(19岁)的人来说, 是多大的责任。不过，另一方面，在这幅沃尔姆斯帝国议会的彩色玻璃窗画中，他看起来像50岁。

**查理对神圣罗马帝国的统治, 是通过选举人的投票获得的，选举人从其他王室或贵族竞争者中, 选中了他。**其中包括萨克森选帝侯“智者”腓特烈，**查理曾为获得其选票而行贿。**腓特烈信仰宗教，但不喜欢教皇制度。**许多贵族认为查理有威胁世界统治的野心，**毕竟他已经统治了世界上很大一部分地区。

因此，当被如此强大的统治者质问时，所有人都以为, 像马丁·路德这样微不足道的修士, 会彻底屈服并承认错误。但他没有：“我别无选择，”据说他在坚守新信仰时这样说道。神圣罗马皇帝宣布他(马丁·路德)为应被逮捕的亡命之徒。但德国诸侯站在他这边，“智者”腓特烈藏匿并保护了路德。为什么？这仍是历史未解之谜之一——也许是因为腓特烈关注教皇的弊端，也许是因为他认为路德无法获得公正审判，也许是因为他觉得路德及其领导的改革运动, 能限制查理的权力。

无论如何，腓特烈去世后，他的弟弟兼继承者, 继续保护路德及其追随者，并在1530年帮助组织了新教诸侯的"施马尔卡尔登联盟", 以保护路德派。说真的，就名字而言，它不如“沃尔姆斯帝国议会”朗朗上口。另一方面，如果漫威在寻找新的超级英雄系列，“施马尔卡尔登新教诸侯联盟”如何？

16世纪20年代初，路德撰写了更多小册子，更详细地阐述自己的信仰。他还将《圣经·新约》翻译成德语——即用当地语言（vernacular）而非精英拉丁语。多亏了印刷术，20万册译本在16世纪20年代至30年代初印刷完成，他的其他许多著作也纷纷付梓。*宗教改革从地方性运动, 发展为德国运动，再成为全欧洲范围的运动，在很大程度上要归功于印刷术。*

**与此同时，许多德国诸侯响应“路德派”对神圣罗马皇帝的挑战。**如果查理反对改革，许多诸侯就会支持改革，**以此遏制神圣罗马皇帝的权力。**路德呼吁他们捍卫德国价值观，反对罗马的腐败。因此，路德有时被称为德国民族主义的源头或“之父”。

然后，1525年，德国南部各地的农民和其他乡村民众, 开始抗议——最终约有10万名暴徒洗劫了城堡和宗教中心。诸侯和贵族镇压了他们——他们可以支持"宗教改革"，但不支持"大规模社会变革"。路德也持相同态度，在《反对暴动的农民》中抨击暴徒，该书很快以耸人听闻的新标题《反对杀人越货的农民暴徒》再版。所以，你懂的，*路德支持某种改革，但不支持像农民平等权利这样的改革。*

**与此同时，改革运动不断传播，并衍生出分支。**1519年，瑞士牧师乌尔里希·茨温利已开始在苏黎世宣扬改革。他支持路德对教皇制度的主要批评，但在圣餐（Eucharist）仪式上持不同意见。圣餐是一种信徒食用面包和饮用葡萄酒的仪式（或不饮用，取决于你的观点）。天主教教义认为，通过“变体论”（transubstantiation）的奇迹，面包和葡萄酒会真正变成耶稣基督的身体和血液；路德主张“共体论”（consubstantiation），即面包和葡萄酒仍是面包和葡萄酒，但同时也是基督的身体和血液。而茨温利认为圣餐只是象征性仪式，面包和葡萄酒仅仅是面包和葡萄酒。

我知道这在许多人看来是极其晦涩的神学争论，似乎不可能重要，但它确实重要——这些神学问题不仅关乎生死，更关乎永生和永死。

茨温利的布道, 最终使他的一些追随者对基督教产生了更激进的诠释。这些人被称为“再洗礼派”（Anabaptists），他们认为, 信仰是个人思想和自由意志的问题。因此，只有有思考能力的成年人, 才能在充分了解的情况下参与基督教信仰，接受耶稣为主和救世主。因此，他们主张，长期以来对婴儿施行的洗礼仪式（一种净化仪式）, 应只提供给选择接受耶稣为救世主的成年人。

[[电视画面：路德结婚]] 随着改革者数量和类型的增加，**路德还做了一件令人震惊的事：1525年，他结婚了，尽管天主教神职人员本应禁欲。路德宣扬上帝创造两性是为了繁衍后代，神职人员的独身主义, 违背了神的计划。**于是他与凯瑟琳娜·冯·博拉结婚——这位识字的年轻女子从五岁起就住在修道院。这甚至在他的支持者中也引发了争议。路德的一位挚友和崇拜者哀叹道，路德结婚是在“德国需要他的精神和权威之际，糟蹋并损害了自己的良好声誉”。但路德撰写了大量关于婚姻的文章，也为诸侯、贵族和日益增多的追随者宣讲婚姻。其中一篇“讲道”引用了《圣经·创世记》中关于亚当和夏娃的故事：“此外，‘女人’这一称谓, 蕴含着对婚姻的奇妙而悦人的描述，正如法学家所说，妻子因丈夫的光芒而闪耀。”“丈夫拥有的一切，妻子也全部拥有……结果是，丈夫与妻子的区别仅在于性别……”这当然不是我们现在所理解的平等——妻子因丈夫的光芒而闪耀，但"婚姻财产平等"的观念在神职人员结婚的“异端”之上, 又叠加了一层“异端”。

[[电视画面：一场恰当的战役]] 这一切导致神圣罗马皇帝查理五世决定, 在1546年和1547年彻底镇压"施马尔卡尔登联盟"中恼人的新教诸侯，且几乎成功。他拥有庞大的资源，包括来自西班牙军队的强悍士兵，这些士兵击败了联盟, 并俘虏了一些主要的新教诸侯。天主教似乎正在卷土重来。但随后，1552年，联盟突然再次出兵，彻底击败了帝国军队。

[[电视画面：奥格斯堡和约]]** #1555年，《奥格斯堡和约》规定，统治者将决定其领土的宗教信仰。#**[[电视窗口画面]] *因此，社区成为"天主教"或"新教"社区，取决于其诸侯的宗教信仰。*

呼。我们真的躲过了"宗教战争"的一劫——不，并没有。宗教改革的故事尚未结束。路德曾称教会腐败是“可怕的憎恶”，其捍卫者是“排泄物和害虫”；如今欧洲其他地区卷入这场激烈宗教斗争的人同样激烈，尽管遵循不同的“剧情”。神学的细微差别继续分裂着人们，宗教政治和海外帝国问题也是如此。简而言之，更多的流血事件还在后头。我们下次再谈。

感谢观看。

Hi, I’m John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

And today, it’s time to find out what else, besides money, was behind the competition between Spain and England as they fought it out on the seas and across the globe after 1550. That’s right, today we get to talk about religion.

As you may know, the Internet is terrible at engaging in nuanced and thoughtful conversations about religion. But if you think our contemporary religious discourse is bad, just wait until you get a load of 16th-century Europe.

**INTRO**
Okay, so over the centuries, the Catholic Church had developed a powerful structure under the papal monarchy. Its courts, religious law, local priests, and a huge bureaucracy of religious officials enforced its domination. And Catholic ideas of the time backed up social and political inequality: for example, Church teachings described monarchs and noble people as closer to God than ordinary people. It also had ideas about how the universe worked and sought to repress those whose ideas were different, as we’ll discuss further when we turn our attention to the Scientific Revolution. But in general, Catholic domination of so many aspects of life produced so much resistance beginning in the early 16th century that European Christianity eventually split into two, and then split into like 17,000 competing subgroups.

It all starts with Martin Luther—a bright young German man whose father wanted him to become a lawyer, as so many fathers do. So Martin Luther went to law school. But his real concern, even after getting his law degree, was salvation, so he became a devout monk. Still though, he was agitated, worried about salvation generally and specifically about Church teachings that faith and good works were needed to achieve salvation. For Luther, doing good works seemed a bit like bribery; like, wasn’t full faith in God the important thing? This kind of thinking meant that Luther was on his way to heresy—that is, beliefs that went against the principles of the Catholic faith. And the heresy of, for instance, denying the pope’s authority could get you burned at the stake, as John Hus was in 1415.

Now, many of Luther’s objections to Church teachings were highly theological, concerning beliefs about, say, whether the word "repent" in the Bible can be said to refer to the sacrament of penance. But one of Luther’s objections was not nearly that obscure, and was much more relevant to ordinary people. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

Okay, so in Catholic doctrine, there was a state after death called Purgatory, a kind of holding place for souls that are not pure enough to ascend to heaven but not bad enough to go to hell. Souls in purgatory can be purified by prayers from the living, and also purified by tortuous afterlife punishment. And in 1517, the pope issued a special indulgence to raise money to continue building the splendid St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome. Purchasing one of these indulgences was said to release a soul from purgatory—so if you had a deceased friend or family member whose sins might not have been totally cleansed through their faith and good works, you could buy an indulgence and get them a ticket to heaven.

Now, this may sound to you like a naked attempt to use people’s worry and grief as a cash grab. And Luther agreed. Like, one monk who sold indulgences literally said, quote: “Don’t you hear the voices of your dead parents and other relatives crying out, ‘Have mercy on us, for we suffer great punishment and pain. From this, you could release us with a few alms. … Why do you treat us so cruelly and leave us to suffer in the flames, when it only takes so little to save us?’” I’m not here to criticize any particular religion, but that is a smidge manipulative. It wasn’t only Luther who took offense to this practice. Merchants and artisans also noted that it seemed a lot like blackmail. Many city-dwellers objected to their hard-earned money going to support the aristocratic children of the wealthy who held high positions in the clergy and lived in luxury without ever having to, you know, earn money.

Thanks, Thought Bubble.

So for Luther, salvation wasn’t something you bought, either by good works or by purchasing indulgences. Instead, he believed in salvation by faith alone and so one should seek to fortify one’s faith. In 1517, Luther, then in his early thirties, composed “Ninety-Five Theses” expressing questions and differing opinions on these and many other theological issues, perhaps posting them to the door of the chapel of Wittenberg. But in whatever form, his ideas spread. Soon, papal documents and books of canon law were being burned by students during protests as earnest young Christian humanists vented their anger. And Luther’s initial questioning of the Church rapidly became rejection: “For we claim the papacy not to be the holy Church,” Luther stated, “nor any part of it, and we are unable to cooperate with it.” This rejection of the Church as it operated in the early sixteenth century came to be called the Reformation.

Luther began to take on the entire Church establishment. In European Catholicism at the time, priests were the authority; THEY read the Bible and then told you what it said. But Luther argued that priests, like all people, were themselves sinners, and that the only true authority was the Bible; it was, he argued, the word of God that provided the relationship with God, not the word of priests. He believed that the hierarchy of priests, and bishops, and cardinals, and the Pope was inherently corrupt, and that such corrupt individuals could hardly serve as intermediaries with the divine. Sola scriptura, only the Bible or scripture, was his motto alongside the keys to salvation: sola gratia and sola fide, only grace and only faith.

The idea of sola scriptura led to a wide-ranging revolution, especially by boosting reading and individual study. Because suddenly, it was important not just for scholars to learn to read, but for everyone, because the written word of God was the way to God.

Now, at first, authorities didn’t see cause for alarm, although early in 1521 the Pope did excommunicate Luther. Several months later, Luther was summoned before representatives of the Holy Roman Empire at the Diet of Worms, which is overwhelmingly the easiest history term to remember because they literally called it the Diet of Worms. Leading the assembly in the town of Worms, Germany was Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.

Oh! Did the globe open? Weird. I don’t get it? I don’t get it, it’s just a can of mixed nuts—what does this have to do with the Diet of Worms? Oh! Stan. Gah. Very frightening. I have a diet...of worms. That’s good stuff, Stan.

Right, but back to Charles V. At the time, Charles was nineteen and ruler of Spain, the Low Countries and Duchy of Burgundy. Also, the entire Habsburg Empire, Italy, and all the Spanish possessions in the Western Hemisphere and Southeast Asia, which—if you’ve ever met or been a 19-year-old, you’ll know is a lot of responsibility for someone who can’t legally drink wine in America. Although, on the other hand, he does look like he is 50 in this stained-glass window of the Diet of Worms.

Charles’ rulership of the Holy Roman Empire was gained through the votes of electors, who had selected him from other royal or noble contenders. Among them was the elector of Saxony, Frederick the Wise, whom Charles had bribed for his vote. Frederick was religious, but not a fan of the papacy. And many aristocrats saw Charles as threatening world domination because, you know, he was dominating a lot of the world.

So when called to account by such a massively powerful ruler, everyone expected that an insignificant monk like Martin Luther would completely fold and admit his errors. But he did not: “I can do no other,” he supposedly said of maintaining his new beliefs. The Holy Roman Emperor declared him an outlaw to be captured. But German princes took his side, and Frederick the Wise hid and protected Luther. Why? Well, that remains one of the unanswered questions of history—maybe it was because Frederick was concerned about papal abuses, maybe because Frederick felt Luther couldn’t get a fair trial, and maybe because he felt that Luther and the reform movements he was leading would limit Charles’s power.

Regardless, after Frederick’s death, his brother and successor continued to protect Luther and his followers, helping in 1530 to organize the Schmalkaldic League of Protestant Princes to protect the Lutherans, which, I mean, as names go, is no Diet of Worms. On the other hand, if Marvel is looking for a new superhero franchise, how about the Schmalkaldic League of Protestant Princes?

Early in the 1520s, Luther wrote tracts outlining his beliefs in greater detail. He also translated the New Testament of the Bible into German—that is, the local language or vernacular instead of elite Latin. And thanks to the printing press, two hundred thousand copies were printed in the 1520s and early 1530s, and many more of his other writings went into print. The Reformation went from being local to being German to being a European-wide movement in large part thanks to the printing press.

Meanwhile, many German princes took up the “Lutheran” challenge to the Holy Roman Emperor. If Charles was against reform, many princes would be for it as a way of restraining the Holy Roman Emperor’s power. Luther summoned them to defend German values against the corruption found in Rome. And because of that, Luther is sometimes called the source or father of German nationalism.

And then, in 1525, peasants and other village folk across southern Germany began protesting—eventually including an estimated 100,000 rioters who sacked castles as well as religious centers. The princes and nobility crushed them—they could get behind religious reform, but not mass social change. And Luther agreed, slamming the rioters in *Against the Rioting Peasants*, soon reprinted with the new sensationalist title—*Against the Murderous, Thieving Hordes of Peasants*. So, you know, Luther favored some reform, but not, like, equal rights for peasants reform.

All the while, the reform movement spread—and as it did, it developed offspring. Already in 1519, Ulrich Zwingli, a Swiss priest, began preaching reform in Zurich. He supported Luther’s main criticisms of the papacy, but he disagreed on the Eucharist, or communion, a ritual in which worshipers eat bread and drink wine. Or don’t. Depending on your perspective. Catholic doctrine held that through the miracle of transubstantiation, the bread and wine literally became the body and blood of Jesus Christ; Luther argued for something called consubstantiation, in which the bread and wine are still bread and wine, yet also the body and blood of Christ. And Zwingli believed Communion only to be a symbolic ritual, in which the bread and wine were just bread and wine.

I know this will seem to many of you like an extremely obscure theological argument that can’t possibly have been important, but it was—these theological questions were not just a matter of life and death; they were a matter of eternal life and death.

Zwingli’s preachings eventually turned some of his followers to a more radical interpretation of Christianity. These people were called Anabaptists, they held that faith was a matter of individual thought and free will. So only a thinking adult could knowingly participate in Christian faith enough to accept Jesus as lord and savior. So they argued that baptism, a cleansing ritual that had long been performed on infants, should only be available to adults who’ve chosen to accept Jesus as savior.

[[TV: Luther Married]] And as reformers increased in number and variety, Luther did something else that was really shocking: in 1525, he got married, even though Catholic clergy were supposed to be celibate. Luther preached that God made two sexes to procreate and that the clergy’s celibacy was against the divine plan. So he married Katharina von Bora, a literate young woman who had been in a convent since the age of five, and this was controversial even among his supporters. One of Luther’s best friends and admirers lamented that by marrying, Luther “revels and compromises his good reputation precisely at a time when Germany stands in need of his spirit and authority.” But Luther wrote a lot about marriage, and sermonized about it too for the princes, nobility, and his growing number of followers. One of these “lectures” refers to the story of Adam and Eve as written about in the book of Genesis in the Bible: “Moreover, this designation [woman] carries with it a wonderful and pleasing description of marriage, in which, as the jurist says, the wife shines by reason of her husband’s rays.” “Whatever the husband has, this the wife has and possesses in its entirety. . . . the result is that the husband differs from the wife in no respect than in sex...” This certainly wasn’t equality as we now understand it, what with the wife shining by reason of her husband’s rays, but the notion of equity of marital property was heresy piled on top of the heresy of clergy marrying.

[[TV: An Appropriate Battle]] All of this led to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V deciding to put down the pesky Protestant princes of the Schmalkaldic League once and for all in 1546 and 1547, and he almost did so. He had vast resources at his disposal, including tough soldiers from the Spanish armies, who defeated the League and captured some leading Protestant princes. And Catholicism appeared to be making a comeback. But then, in 1552, the League suddenly took to the field again, roundly defeating the imperial forces.

[[TV: Peace of Augsburg]] In 1555, the Peace of Augsburg decreed that whoever ruled would determine the religion of his territory. [[TV Window]] And so communities became Catholic or Protestant based on the religion of their prince.

Phew. We really dodged a religious war bullet—nope, no. The Reformation story was not over. Luther had called Church corruption a “horrid abomination” and its defenders “excrements and vermin”; and those who now entered this titanic religious struggle in other parts of Europe were just as vehement, even though following different plots. The finer points of theology continued to divide people, as did the politics of religion and overseas empire. In short, more bloodshed to follow. We’ll take that up next time.

Thanks for watching.
