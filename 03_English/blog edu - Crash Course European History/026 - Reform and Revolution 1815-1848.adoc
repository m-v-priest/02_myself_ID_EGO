== 释义

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History. So today we're looking at early 19th century Europe, which is to say everything from 1815 to 1848, when various forms of excrement 排泄物；粪便 hit various fans. +

You'll recall that at the Congress of Vienna 维也纳会议, Prince Metternich 梅特涅亲王 and his allies 盟友 tried to extinguish 扑灭；消除 the fires of social ferment 社会动荡 and prevent another French Revolution -- or indeed any hint 迹象 of revolution. +

But despite the Congress of Vienna's determined 坚决的 efforts to prevent them, reform 改革 and activism 行动主义 heated up after 1815 alongside industrialization 工业化. +

[Intro] +

In the 19th century, people were looking inward 向内 at the domestic policies 国内政策 of each kingdom or state, which was a sharp difference from the early modern period when kingdoms were constantly fighting one another with domestic issues being much less of a concern. +

But much of what was happening outside of Europe did affect Europe, of course. In the 1810s and 1820s, for instance 例如, North, Central, and South American people gained their independence 独立 from Portugal and Spain. +

Simón Bolívar 西蒙·玻利瓦尔, one upper-class 上层阶级 leader of the independence movement, took his inspiration 灵感, and to some extent 在某种程度上 his aesthetic 美学, from Napoleon, who, he believed, had freed people from the old regime 旧政权 of absolutism 专制主义. Which is an interesting take on 对…的看法 Napoleon. +

Oppressed 压迫 by the heavy taxation 重税 inflicted 施加 by "enlightened" administration 行政管理 on the colonies 殖民地, native peoples 原住民, African slaves 奴隶, and other poor people backed 支持 elite 精英, locally-born leaders like Bolívar. And they were all united in their resentment 怨恨 of Spanish domination 统治. +

By 1830, colonists' victories put mainland Spain at its weakest in three centuries. So, while distant ferment 动荡 liberated 解放 much of the Spanish and Portuguese empires, within post-Napoleonic 后拿破仑时代的 Europe, citizens' groups 公民团体 of all sorts blossomed 兴起 across the continent and reformist 改革派的 uprisings 起义 against rulers flourished 蓬勃发展, often having developed in secret given the operation of censorship 审查制度 and not-so-secret police 不那么秘密的警察. +

Literacy 识字率 grew following the Enlightenment's 启蒙运动 emphasis on education, technology, and rational thought 理性思维. Constitutions 宪法 and the rule of law 法治 were increasingly longed for 渴望 and valued. Even many aristocrats 贵族 were themselves surprisingly restless 不安分的 and ready for change. +

Russian aristocrats feared that, despite their own centrality 中心地位 in defeating Napoleon, the czar 沙皇 would exercise 行使 his dictatorial 独裁的 inclinations 倾向. Because, you know. Czars. +

And many in the Russian nobility 贵族 were now acquainted with 了解 the possibilities for a different kind of political system -- especially one guided by the rule of law and constitutions. +

In December 1825, some of the aristocratic elite 贵族精英 challenged the new Tsar Nicholas I 沙皇尼古拉一世 in order to make his supposedly 据说 more liberal 自由派的 older brother Constantin tsar instead. But these "Decembrists" 十二月党人 were mowed down 扫射 or captured by loyal units of the army. Some were executed 处决 and many were sent into exile 流放 in Siberia 西伯利亚, where they made new towns and cities into cultural centers. Albeit 尽管, cold ones. +

By this time, a large contingent 队伍 in the Russian aristocracy 贵族 were more deeply cultured 有文化修养的 and polylingual 多语言的 than the upper classes in any other European kingdom, but the possibility for a non-autocratic 非专制的 Russia seemed to end with the Decembrist defeat. +

Nicholas and his successors 继任者 upheld 维护 the monarchy 君主制, relentlessly 无情地 clamping down on 镇压 any threats to it, including a Polish uprising 起义 in 1830-31, continuing Poland's run of poor fortune 厄运 that would remain essentially the only constant in European history for another 160 years. +

Let's go to the Thought Bubble. +

1. In 1830, another revolution broke out 爆发 in France, +
2. bringing about 导致 a quick but consequential 重要的 change in government. +
3. It began after Charles X 查理十世 ushered in 引入 strict censorship 严格审查, +
4. compensation 补偿 for aristocratic losses in the revolution of 1789, +
5. and similarly regressive 倒退的 measures such as imposing the death penalty 判处死刑 for any pilfering 偷窃 of church objects. +
6. Opponents 反对者, many from the well-educated and land-owning upper class 受过良好教育的有土地的上层阶级
7. and others from the religious object pilfering class, +
8. took these moves as harbingers 预兆 of a return to absolutism, +
9. which to be fair 公平地说, they were. +
10. As street protests erupted 爆发, these opponents also worried that commoners 平民 would demand that France become a republic 共和国 once again. And they didn't want that. +
11. In what is known as the "Three Glorious Days" of July 1830, +
12. they installed 推举 Charles's cousin Louis-Philippe 路易 - 菲利普 as king and created a constitutional monarchy 君主立宪制
13. -- that is, they returned the country to the situation of the early 1790s with a government based on a form of popular sovereignty 人民主权 instead of divine right 神权. +
14. The new king Louis-Philippe expanded voting rights 投票权, known as suffrage 选举权, to around 170,000 men, +
15. but that was still a tiny fraction 小部分 of the 30 million French citizens. +
16. Social unrest 社会动荡 remained high as France became a more industrialized economy with more people living in cities. +
17. Both living and working conditions for common people were often terrible. +
18. The silk workers of Lyon 里昂, for instance, went on strike 罢工 in 1831 over poor pay 低工资, +
19. and even briefly seized 占领 the city's arsenal 军火库
20. before the revolt 起义 was eventually put down 镇压. +
21. In short 简而言之, the entrenched 根深蒂固的 system of power wasn't going to allow another fully populist 民粹主义的 revolution. +

Thanks Thought Bubble. +

So, Prince Metternich's ambitions 野心 for a tranquil 安宁的 citizenry 公民 had clearly failed to materialize 实现. Across the Austrian lands there was the kind of discussion and agitation 鼓动 that came from reading books, meeting in cafés, and having a better education: More people wanted a say in 对…有发言权 their governance 治理, and expected rights that would be protected by the state. +

But this agitation percolated 渗透 mostly in secret, thanks to Metternich's censors 审查官 and secret police 秘密警察. +

In Italy, the Carbonari 烧炭党, a secret society 秘密社团 aiming for constitutional government 立宪政府 in parts of Italy, directed uprisings 起义 in 1820 and 1830. But the forces of the Holy Alliance 神圣同盟 of Austria, Prussia and Russia put down 镇压 both revolts 叛乱. +

Also during these decades, Hungarian nobility 匈牙利贵族, also operating in Metternich's orbit 在梅特涅的势力范围内, lobbied for 游说 separation from 脱离 the Austrian empire, but without much luck. +

Serbia 塞尔维亚 and Greece 希腊 had more success in pulling away from 脱离 the Ottomans 奥斯曼帝国. The Serbs became an independent principality 公国 under the Ottomans in 1817 after an uprising in 1815. And the Greeks won complete independence from the Ottomans in 1831. +

For romantics 浪漫主义者 such as the English poet Lord Byron 拜伦勋爵, these were the struggles of heroes seeking revolutionary freedoms 革命自由. +

Did the Center of the World just open? Is my Norton Anthology of Poetry 诺顿诗歌选集 in there? +

Ah Lord Byron. He wrote a poem from Greece in 1824 called, "On this Day I Complete My 36th Year." In that poem he writes, "Awake! Not Greece, She is awake." +

In fact, Byron went to Greece in the 1820s to aide in 帮助 the independence movement. He also died there. Just a few months after this poem was written, actually, in which he says, "my days are in the yellow leaf. The flowers and fruits of love are gone. The worm, the chancre, and the grief are mine alone." That's what it was like to be 36 in 1824. +

Ah god, I hope my days aren't in yellow leaf. +

OK, let's talk about Peterloo 彼得卢. +

Struggles in Britain during these decades were tinged with 带有…的色彩 the rebellions 叛乱 of Irish Catholics 爱尔兰天主教徒 against official religious discrimination 宗教歧视. +

Simultaneously 同时, in the difficult years immediately following Waterloo when harvests failed 歉收 and the cost of living 生活成本 rose, crowds of working people by the tens of thousands gathered in cities across Great Britain to listen to calls for change. +

Parliament 议会 wanted to protect aristocratic agricultural interests 贵族农业利益, which tells you a lot about the British Parliament at the time, and so they raised the price of grain 谷物 by passing the Corn Laws 谷物法. Orators 演说者 demanded their repeal 废除. And the upper classes were on edge 紧张不安. +

Then in 1819, during a protest in St. Peter's Field, Manchester, police shot into the crowd and killed some 15 people and wounded 500. The so-called "Peterloo Massacre" 彼得卢大屠杀 -- a term created by pundits 专家 to invoke 援引 Waterloo -- was followed by the draconian 严厉的 Six Acts that allowed government searches, prohibited large assemblies 集会, and punished anti-government publications 出版物. +

But outrage 愤怒 and activism continued in Great Britain and Ireland. The Irish were especially hard hit by the economic downturn 衰退, which resulted in the confiscation 没收 of peasant lands by Great Britain. +

And in 1801 a series of laws joined Ireland to the rest of Great Britain (together, the laws are referred to as The Act of Union 联合法案). And despite this purported 声称的 unity, discrimination among Catholics remained powerful allowing almost unchecked confiscation of Catholic property and other assets 资产. +

In 1823, Irish activist 活动家 and lawyer Daniel O'Connell formed the Catholic Association 天主教协会 which lobbied for 游说 allowing Catholics to have high positions, including membership in the British Parliament 英国议会. +

And the Catholic Association's activism plus the accumulation 积累 of middle- and working-class grievances 不满 eventually led to the Great Reform Act of 1832 1832年大改革法案. This act eliminated "rotten boroughs" 衰败选区 -- that is, districts where aristocrats would become members of parliament almost by birthright 与生俱来的权利, even in some "districts" that had no actual residents. +

The Great Reform Act also gave representation 代表权 to new industrial cities -- like Manchester -- that had no parliamentary representation at all. And more men got the right to vote, including middle-class property owners and those paying an established minimum rent 最低租金. But of course the definition of that minimum rent was kept high enough to keep lots of other people, including most ordinary workers, and all women, were still left out. +

OK, so we saw in our episodes on industrialization that in France a group of aristocrats, calling themselves socialists 社会主义者, wanted to better society due to a belief that the late eighteenth century revolutionary era had focused too much on the individual and should focus more on the health of the whole. Their socialism entailed 意味着 philanthropy 慈善事业. +

And by the 1820s a new group of socialists, especially prominent 杰出的 in England and France, had a different take on 对…有不同看法 the issues of the day. +

In Britain, Robert Owen 罗伯特·欧文, who had made his fortune 发财 in textiles 纺织业, inspired the creation of utopian communities 乌托邦社区. In these communities, factory hands 工厂工人 would work a limited number of hours and have benefits including education. And profit 利润 was to take a back seat to 退居次要地位 the overall well-being 福祉 of the community and all of its individual members. +

Owen's ideas gained traction 受到关注 among reform-minded industrialists, and officials, and workers, and thinkers, especially since industrialization with its child labor 童工 and incredibly high rates of maiming 致残 and workplace death 工伤死亡 was rather dystopian 反乌托邦的. +

Similarly in France during the post-Napoleonic period, Claude Henri Saint-Simon 克劳德·亨利·圣西门, Charles Fourier 夏尔·傅立叶, and Auguste Comte 奥古斯特·孔德 devised 构思 ideas for well-run communities that emphasized harmony 和谐 and efficient management 高效管理. +

One common idea was belief in the rational organization 合理组织 of human societies. Engineers and planners featured prominently 突出 in utopian ideas as their skills would make society operate without tensions 紧张 and uprisings 起义 -- that is, like a well-designed machine. +

These thinkers' "socialism" contributed to the formation of modern social sciences 现代社会科学: sociology 社会学, economics 经济学, anthropology 人类学, and government. And around the world, people set up phalansteries 法郎吉 -- the name of communities based on Fourier's writings -- organized around the personality characteristics 个性特征 he outlined 概述. +

Although German lawyer and theorist Karl Marx 卡尔·马克思 scorned 蔑视 these ideas and the communities based on them, they also helped pave the way for 为…铺平道路 the socialism to come. +

Now God knows that we're going to talk more about Marx.. what's that Stan? Oh, Stan informs me that I can't talk about Marx and God knowing anything, because to Marx religion was the opiate of the masses 宗教是人民的鸦片. +

We'll talk more about Marx, and his use of the term "socialism," in the next episode. Then and now socialism had many meanings, and its definition was ever evolving 不断发展. +

The same could be said of the word "liberal" 自由主义者, which was also evolving from a seventeenth-century belief in basic liberties 基本自由 at birth to the idea of free trade 自由贸易 in the eighteenth century to the concern with accessibility to suffrage 选举权 in the nineteenth and twentieth. +

But for now, I just want to note that as people became better-educated and were exposed to 接触到 ideas of individual rights 个人权利 and popular participation in government 民众参与政府管理, it became very difficult for the powerful to hold onto 维持 that power without popular support 民众支持. +

Your education, and mine, is similarly an opportunity to be exposed to many different ideas, so that we might be productive 有成效的, critical 批判性的, and thoughtful 有思想的 contributors to the political and social lives of our communities, as well as the economic life of our community. +

And just as the people of early 19th century Europe were shaped by the voices they listened to and the ideas they encountered 遇到, we are also shaped by those voices. So listen carefully, and as my friend Amy Krouse Rosenthal once wrote, Pay attention to what you pay attention to. +

Thanks for being here. We'll see you next time. +

大家好，我是约翰·格林，这里是《速成欧洲史》。所以今天我们要探讨的是19世纪早期的欧洲，也就是从1815年到1848年这段时间，在1848年各种麻烦事接踵而至。 +

你应该还记得，在维也纳会议（Congress of Vienna）上，梅特涅亲王（Prince Metternich）和他的盟友们试图扑灭社会动荡的火焰，防止另一场法国大革命（French Revolution）——或者说，防止任何革命的苗头出现。 +

但是，尽管维也纳会议下定决心要阻止革命，1815年之后，随着工业化的发展，改革和激进运动还是不断升温。 +

[开场介绍] +

在19世纪，人们开始关注各个王国或国家的国内政策，这与近代早期截然不同，在近代早期，各个王国之间不断相互争斗，而国内问题则远没有那么受关注。 +

当然，欧洲以外发生的许多事情确实对欧洲产生了影响。例如，在19世纪10年代和20年代，北美洲、中美洲和南美洲的人们从葡萄牙（Portugal）和西班牙（Spain）手中赢得了独立。 +

西蒙·玻利瓦尔（Simón Bolívar）是独立运动的一位上层阶级领袖，他从拿破仑（Napoleon）那里获得了灵感，在某种程度上，他的审美也受到了拿破仑的影响。他认为，拿破仑将人们从旧的专制政权中解放了出来。这对拿破仑的看法很有意思。 +

殖民地的原住民、非洲奴隶（African slaves）和其他穷人受到 “开明” 政府强加的重税压迫，他们支持像玻利瓦尔这样在当地出生的精英领袖。他们都因对西班牙统治的不满而团结在一起。 +

到1830年，殖民者的胜利让西班牙本土陷入了三个世纪以来最虚弱的状态。所以，当遥远地区的动荡解放了西班牙和葡萄牙帝国的大部分地区时，在拿破仑之后的欧洲，各种各样的公民团体在整个欧洲大陆蓬勃发展，反对统治者的改革起义层出不穷。由于审查制度的存在和并不隐秘的秘密警察，这些起义往往是秘密发展起来的。 +

随着启蒙运动（Enlightenment）对教育、技术和理性思维的强调，识字率有所提高。人们越来越渴望和重视宪法（Constitutions）和法治（the rule of law）。甚至许多贵族也出人意料地躁动不安，渴望变革。 +

俄罗斯贵族（Russian aristocrats）担心，尽管他们在击败拿破仑的过程中发挥了核心作用，但沙皇（czar）仍会行使他的独裁倾向。毕竟，沙皇就是这样。 +

而且现在许多俄罗斯贵族已经了解到了另一种政治制度的可能性——尤其是一种以法治和宪法为指导的制度。 +

1825年12月，一些贵族精英挑战新沙皇尼古拉一世（Tsar Nicholas I），希望让他那位据说更开明的哥哥康斯坦丁（Constantin）成为沙皇。但这些 “十二月党人”（“Decembrists”）被忠诚的军队部队镇压或抓获。一些人被处决，许多人被流放到西伯利亚（Siberia），在那里他们把新的城镇变成了文化中心，尽管那里很寒冷。 +

到这个时候，俄罗斯贵族中的很大一部分人比其他任何欧洲王国的上层阶级都更有文化修养，并且会说多种语言，但随着十二月党人的失败，俄罗斯走向非专制制度的可能性似乎也随之破灭了。 +

尼古拉和他的继任者们维护着君主制，无情地镇压任何对其构成威胁的因素，包括1830年至1831年的波兰起义（Polish uprising），这让波兰继续遭遇不幸，在接下来的160年里，这几乎成了欧洲历史上唯一不变的事情。 +

让我们进入“思想泡泡”环节。 +

1. 1830年，法国又爆发了一场革命， +
2. 迅速带来了政府的重大变革。 +
3. 这场革命始于查理十世（Charles X）实行严格的审查制度， +
4. 对贵族在1789年法国大革命中遭受的损失进行补偿， +
5. 以及实施类似的倒退措施，比如对任何盗窃教堂物品的行为都处以死刑。 +
6. 反对者中，许多人来自受过良好教育且拥有土地的上层阶级， +
7. 还有一些人来自盗窃教堂物品的群体， +
8. 他们把这些举措视为专制制度复辟的预兆， +
9. 公平地说，确实如此。 +
10. 随着街头抗议活动的爆发，这些反对者还担心平民会要求法国再次成为一个共和国。而他们不希望这样。 +
11. 在1830年7月被称为 “光荣三日”（“Three Glorious Days”）的事件中， +
12. 他们拥立查理的堂弟路易-菲利普（Louis-Philippe）为国王，并建立了君主立宪制（constitutional monarchy）， +
13. 也就是说，他们让国家回到了18世纪90年代早期的状态，政府基于一种人民主权（popular sovereignty）的形式，而不是君权神授（divine right）。 +
14. 新国王路易-菲利普将投票权（suffrage）扩大到了大约17万名男性， +
15. 但这仍然只是3000万法国公民中的一小部分。 +
16. 随着法国成为一个更加工业化的经济体，越来越多的人生活在城市里，社会动荡依然严重。 +
17. 普通人的生活和工作条件往往都很糟糕。 +
18. 例如，里昂（Lyon）的丝绸工人（silk workers）在1831年因工资过低而举行罢工， +
19. 甚至短暂地占领了城市的军火库（arsenal）， +
20. 最终起义被镇压下去。 +
21. 简而言之，根深蒂固的权力体系不会允许另一场完全由民众推动的革命发生。 +

感谢“思想泡泡”！ +

所以，梅特涅亲王让民众保持安宁的愿望显然没有实现。在奥地利（Austria）各地，人们通过读书、在咖啡馆聚会以及接受更好的教育，展开了各种讨论和鼓动活动：越来越多的人希望在治理国家方面有发言权，并期望自己的权利能得到国家的保护。 +

但由于梅特涅的审查制度和秘密警察的存在，这种鼓动活动大多是秘密进行的。 +

在意大利（Italy），烧炭党（Carbonari）是一个旨在让意大利部分地区实现立宪政府的秘密社团，他们在1820年和1830年领导了起义。但奥地利、普鲁士（Prussia）和俄罗斯组成的神圣同盟（Holy Alliance）的军队镇压了这两次起义。 +

同样在这几十年里，处于梅特涅势力范围内的匈牙利贵族（Hungarian nobility），为脱离奥地利帝国（Austrian empire）进行了游说，但收效甚微。 +

塞尔维亚（Serbia）和希腊（Greece）在脱离奥斯曼帝国（Ottomans）方面取得了更大的成功。1815年起义后，塞尔维亚人在1817年成为奥斯曼帝国统治下的一个独立公国（independent principality）。希腊人则在1831年从奥斯曼帝国手中赢得了完全独立。 +

对于像英国诗人拜伦勋爵（Lord Byron）这样的浪漫主义者来说，这些是英雄们为争取革命自由而进行的斗争。 +

世界的中心刚刚打开了吗？我的《诺顿诗歌选集》（Norton Anthology of Poetry）在里面吗？ +

啊，拜伦勋爵。他在1824年从希腊写了一首诗，名为《在我三十六岁生日这天》（“On this Day I Complete My 36th Year”）。在那首诗里他写道：“醒来吧！不是希腊，她已经醒来。” +

事实上，拜伦在19世纪20年代去了希腊，以支持那里的独立运动。他也在那里去世了。实际上，就在这首诗写完几个月后，他在诗中写道：“我的日子已到黄叶飘零的时节。爱情的花朵与果实都已凋落。只有虫害、溃疡和忧伤与我相伴。” 这就是1824年36岁时的写照。 +

啊，天哪，我希望我的日子不要到 “黄叶飘零” 的时候。 +

好的，让我们谈谈彼得卢（Peterloo）事件。 +

在这几十年里，英国（Britain）的斗争还夹杂着爱尔兰天主教徒（Irish Catholics）对官方宗教歧视的反抗。 +

与此同时，在滑铁卢（Waterloo）战役后的艰难岁月里，由于收成不佳，生活成本上升，成千上万的劳动人民聚集在英国各地的城市，倾听变革的呼声。 +

英国议会（British Parliament）想要保护贵族的农业利益，这充分说明了当时英国议会的立场，所以他们通过了《谷物法》（Corn Laws）来提高谷物价格。演说者们要求废除这些法律。上层阶级也因此紧张不安。 +

然后在1819年，在曼彻斯特（Manchester）圣彼得广场（St. Peter's Field）的一次抗议活动中，警察向人群开枪，导致大约15人死亡，500人受伤。这场所谓的 “彼得卢大屠杀”（“Peterloo Massacre”）——这个词是专家们创造的，用来让人联想到滑铁卢战役——之后，英国出台了严厉的《六项法案》（Six Acts），允许政府进行搜查，禁止大规模集会，并惩罚反政府出版物。 +

但在英国和爱尔兰（Ireland），愤怒和激进活动仍在继续。爱尔兰人尤其受到经济衰退的沉重打击，这导致英国没收了农民的土地。 +

1801年，一系列法律将爱尔兰与英国其他地区合并（这些法律统称为《联合法案》，The Act of Union）。尽管名义上实现了统一，但对天主教徒的歧视依然严重，几乎可以不受限制地没收天主教徒的财产和其他资产。 +

1823年，爱尔兰活动家兼律师丹尼尔·奥康奈尔（Daniel O'Connell）成立了天主教协会（Catholic Association），该协会游说允许天主教徒担任高级职位，包括成为英国议会的议员。 +

天主教协会的积极活动，加上中产阶级和工人阶级积累的不满情绪，最终促成了1832年的《大改革法案》（Great Reform Act）。这项法案废除了 “衰败选区”（“rotten boroughs”）——也就是说，在这些选区里，贵族几乎生来就有资格成为议员，甚至在一些实际上没有居民的 “选区” 也是如此。 +

《大改革法案》还赋予了像曼彻斯特这样的新兴工业城市议会代表权，这些城市以前根本没有议会代表。更多的男性获得了投票权，包括中产阶级的有产者和那些支付既定最低租金的人。但当然，最低租金的定义被设定得足够高，以至于很多其他人，包括大多数普通工人和所有女性，仍然被排除在外。 +

好的，我们在关于工业化的节目中看到，在法国，一群自称为社会主义者（socialists）的贵族希望改善社会，因为他们认为18世纪后期的革命时代过于关注个人，而应该更多地关注整个社会的健康发展。他们的社会主义包括慈善事业（philanthropy）。 +

到了19世纪20年代，一群新的社会主义者，在英国和法国尤为突出，对当时的问题有了不同的看法。 +

在英国，靠纺织业发家致富的罗伯特·欧文（Robert Owen）激发了乌托邦社区（utopian communities）的创建。在这些社区里，工厂工人的工作时间有限，并享有包括教育在内的福利。与社区及其所有成员的整体福祉相比，利润退居次要地位。 +

欧文的思想在有改革意识的工业家、官员、工人和思想家中受到了关注，特别是因为工业化带来了童工问题，以及极高的致残率和工作场所死亡率，这相当反乌托邦。 +

同样，在拿破仑之后的法国，克劳德·亨利·圣西门（Claude Henri Saint-Simon）、夏尔·傅立叶（Charles Fourier）和奥古斯特·孔德（Auguste Comte）提出了关于管理良好的社区的构想，强调和谐与高效管理。 +

一个共同的观点是相信人类社会的合理组织。工程师和规划者在乌托邦思想中占据重要地位，因为他们的技能可以使社会在没有紧张局势和起义的情况下运转——也就是说，就像一台设计精良的机器。 +

这些思想家的 “社会主义” 促进了现代社会科学的形成：社会学（sociology）、经济学（economics）、人类学（anthropology）和政治学（government）。在世界各地，人们建立起了法伦斯泰尔（phalansteries）——这是根据傅立叶的著作建立的社区的名称——按照他所描述的个性特征进行组织。 +

尽管德国律师和理论家卡尔·马克思（Karl Marx）嘲笑这些思想以及基于这些思想建立的社区，但它们也为后来的社会主义发展铺平了道路。 +

天知道我们还会更多地谈论马克思…… 什么，斯坦？哦，斯坦告诉我，我不能一边谈论马克思，一边说天知道什么的，因为对马克思来说，宗教是人民的鸦片（opiate of the masses）。 +

我们将在下一集中更多地谈论马克思，以及他对 “社会主义” 这个词的使用。那时和现在，社会主义都有很多含义，它的定义也在不断演变。 +

“自由主义”（“liberal”）这个词也是如此，它从17世纪对与生俱来的基本自由的信仰，演变为18世纪的自由贸易思想，再到19世纪和20世纪对投票权可及性的关注。 +

但目前，我只是想指出，随着人们受教育程度的提高，接触到个人权利和民众参与政府管理的思想，对于那些掌权者来说，如果没有民众的支持，就很难继续维持权力。 +

你所接受的教育和我所接受的教育，同样让我们有机会接触到许多不同的思想，这样我们就可以成为对我们社区的政治、社会生活以及经济生活富有成效、批判性和思考性的贡献者。 +

就像19世纪早期的欧洲人受到他们所听到的声音和所接触到的思想的影响一样，我们也受到这些声音的影响。所以要仔细倾听，就像我的朋友艾米·克劳斯·罗森塔尔（Amy Krouse Rosenthal）曾经写的那样，关注你所关注的东西。 +

感谢大家的收看。我们下次再见。 +

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History. So today we're looking at early 19th century Europe, which is to say everything from 1815 to 1848, when various forms of excrement hit various fans. +

You'll recall that at the Congress of Vienna, Prince Metternich and his allies tried to extinguish the fires of social ferment and prevent another French Revolution -- or indeed any hint of revolution. +

But despite the Congress of Vienna's determined efforts to prevent them, reform and activism heated up after 1815 alongside industrialization. +

[Intro] +

In the 19th century, people were looking inward at the domestic policies of each kingdom or state, which was a sharp difference from the early modern period when kingdoms were constantly fighting one another with domestic issues being much less of a concern. +

But much of what was happening outside of Europe did affect Europe, of course. In the 1810s and 1820s, for instance, North, Central, and South American people gained their independence from Portugal and Spain. +

Simón Bolívar, one upper-class leader of the independence movement, took his inspiration, and to some extent his aesthetic, from Napoleon, who, he believed, had freed people from the old regime of absolutism. Which is an interesting take on Napoleon. +

Oppressed by the heavy taxation inflicted by "enlightened" administration on the colonies, native peoples, African slaves, and other poor people backed elite, locally-born leaders like Bolívar. And they were all united in their resentment of Spanish domination. +

By 1830, colonists' victories put mainland Spain at its weakest in three centuries. So, while distant ferment liberated much of the Spanish and Portuguese empires, within post-Napoleonic Europe, citizens' groups of all sorts blossomed across the continent and reformist uprisings against rulers flourished, often having developed in secret given the operation of censorship and not-so-secret police. +

Literacy grew following the Enlightenment's emphasis on education, technology, and rational thought. Constitutions and the rule of law were increasingly longed for and valued. Even many aristocrats were themselves surprisingly restless and ready for change. +

Russian aristocrats feared that, despite their own centrality in defeating Napoleon, the czar would exercise his dictatorial inclinations. Because, you know. Czars. +

And many in the Russian nobility were now acquainted with the possibilities for a different kind of political system -- especially one guided by the rule of law and constitutions. +

In December 1825, some of the aristocratic elite challenged the new Tsar Nicholas I in order to make his supposedly more liberal older brother Constantin tsar instead. But these "Decembrists" were mowed down or captured by loyal units of the army. Some were executed and many were sent into exile in Siberia, where they made new towns and cities into cultural centers. Albeit, cold ones. +

By this time, a large contingent in the Russian aristocracy were more deeply cultured and polylingual than the upper classes in any other European kingdom, but the possibility for a non-autocratic Russia seemed to end with the Decembrist defeat. +

Nicholas and his successors upheld the monarchy, relentlessly clamping down on any threats to it, including a Polish uprising in 1830-31, continuing Poland's run of poor fortune that would remain essentially the only constant in European history for another 160 years. +

Let's go to the Thought Bubble. +

1. In 1830, another revolution broke out in France, +
2. bringing about a quick but consequential change in government. +
3. It began after Charles X ushered in strict censorship, +
4. compensation for aristocratic losses in the revolution of 1789, +

Thanks Thought Bubble. +

So, Prince Metternich's ambitions for a tranquil citizenry had clearly failed to materialize. Across the Austrian lands there was the kind of discussion and agitation that came from reading books, meeting in cafés, and having a better education: More people wanted a say in their governance, and expected rights that would be protected by the state. +

But this agitation percolated mostly in secret, thanks to Metternich's censors and secret police. +

In Italy, the Carbonari, a secret society aiming for constitutional government in parts of Italy, directed uprisings in 1820 and 1830. But the forces of the Holy Alliance of Austria, Prussia and Russia put down both revolts. +

Also during these decades, Hungarian nobility, also operating in Metternich's orbit, lobbied for separation from the Austrian empire, but without much luck. +

Serbia and Greece had more success in pulling away from the Ottomans. The Serbs became an independent principality under the Ottomans in 1817 after an uprising in 1815. And the Greeks won complete independence from the Ottomans in 1831. +

For romantics such as the English poet Lord Byron, these were the struggles of heroes seeking revolutionary freedoms. +

Did the Center of the World just open? Is my Norton Anthology of Poetry in there? +

Ah Lord Byron. He wrote a poem from Greece in 1824 called, "On this Day I Complete My 36th Year." In that poem he writes, "Awake! Not Greece, She is awake." +

In fact, Byron went to Greece in the 1820s to aide in the independence movement. He also died there. Just a few months after this poem was written, actually, in which he says, "my days are in the yellow leaf. The flowers and fruits of love are gone. The worm, the chancre, and the grief are mine alone." That's what it was like to be 36 in 1824. +

Ah god, I hope my days aren't in yellow leaf. +

OK, let's talk about Peterloo. +

Struggles in Britain during these decades were tinged with the rebellions of Irish Catholics against official religious discrimination. +

Simultaneously, in the difficult years immediately following Waterloo when harvests failed and the cost of living rose, crowds of working people by the tens of thousands gathered in cities across Great Britain to listen to calls for change. +

Parliament wanted to protect aristocratic agricultural interests, which tells you a lot about the British Parliament at the time, and so they raised the price of grain by passing the Corn Laws. Orators demanded their repeal. And the upper classes were on edge. +

Then in 1819, during a protest in St. Peter's Field, Manchester, police shot into the crowd and killed some 15 people and wounded 500. The so-called "Peterloo Massacre" -- a term created by pundits to invoke Waterloo -- was followed by the draconian Six Acts that allowed government searches, prohibited large assemblies, and punished anti-government publications. +

But outrage and activism continued in Great Britain and Ireland. The Irish were especially hard hit by the economic downturn, which resulted in the confiscation of peasant lands by Great Britain. +

And in 1801 a series of laws joined Ireland to the rest of Great Britain (together, the laws are referred to as The Act of Union). And despite this purported unity, discrimination among Catholics remained powerful allowing almost unchecked confiscation of Catholic property and other assets. +

In 1823, Irish activist and lawyer Daniel O'Connell formed the Catholic Association which lobbied for allowing Catholics to have high positions, including membership in the British Parliament. +

And the Catholic Association's activism plus the accumulation of middle- and working-class grievances eventually led to the Great Reform Act of 1832. This act eliminated "rotten boroughs" -- that is, districts where aristocrats would become members of parliament almost by birthright, even in some "districts" that had no actual residents. +

The Great Reform Act also gave representation to new industrial cities -- like Manchester -- that had no parliamentary representation at all. And more men got the right to vote, including middle-class property owners and those paying an established minimum rent. But of course the definition of that minimum rent was kept high enough to keep lots of other people, including most ordinary workers, and all women, were still left out. +

OK, so we saw in our episodes on industrialization that in France a group of aristocrats, calling themselves socialists, wanted to better society due to a belief that the late eighteenth century revolutionary era had focused too much on the individual and should focus more on the health of the whole. Their socialism entailed philanthropy. +

And by the 1820s a new group of socialists, especially prominent in England and France, had a different take on the issues of the day. +

In Britain, Robert Owen, who had made his fortune in textiles, inspired the creation of utopian communities. In these communities, factory hands would work a limited number of hours and have benefits including education. And profit was to take a back seat to the overall well-being of the community and all of its individual members. +

Owen's ideas gained traction among reform-minded industrialists, and officials, and workers, and thinkers, especially since industrialization with its child labor and incredibly high rates of maiming and workplace death was rather dystopian. +

Similarly in France during the post-Napoleonic period, Claude Henri Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier, and Auguste Comte devised ideas for well-run communities that emphasized harmony and efficient management. +

One common idea was belief in the rational organization of human societies. Engineers and planners featured prominently in utopian ideas as their skills would make society operate without tensions and uprisings -- that is, like a well-designed machine. +

These thinkers' "socialism" contributed to the formation of modern social sciences: sociology, economics, anthropology, and government. And around the world, people set up phalansteries -- the name of communities based on Fourier's writings -- organized around the personality characteristics he outlined. +

Although German lawyer and theorist Karl Marx scorned these ideas and the communities based on them, they also helped pave the way for the socialism to come. +

Now God knows that we're going to talk more about Marx.. what's that Stan? Oh, Stan informs me that I can't talk about Marx and God knowing anything, because to Marx religion was the opiate of the masses. +

We'll talk more about Marx, and his use of the term "socialism," in the next episode. Then and now socialism had many meanings, and its definition was ever evolving. +

The same could be said of the word "liberal," which was also evolving from a seventeenth-century belief in basic liberties at birth to the idea of free trade in the eighteenth century to the concern with accessibility to suffrage in the nineteenth and twentieth. +

But for now, I just want to note that as people became better-educated and were exposed to ideas of individual rights and popular participation in government, it became very difficult for the powerful to hold onto that power without popular support. +

Your education, and mine, is similarly an opportunity to be exposed to many different ideas, so that we might be productive, critical, and thoughtful contributors to the political and social lives of our communities, as well as the economic life of our community. +

And just as the people of early 19th century Europe were shaped by the voices they listened to and the ideas they encountered, we are also shaped by those voices. So listen carefully, and as my friend Amy Krouse Rosenthal once wrote, Pay attention to what you pay attention to. +

Thanks for being here. We'll see you next time. +
