== 释义

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.


So, the word revolution 革命 is a funny one, because it literally 照字面地 means a full turn of 360 degrees.

Like, you end a revolution where you started out.

But in history, revolution means radical 彻底的；激进的 change, stark 明显的 departures from 背离 the world that was, and the messy 混乱的, often violent embrace of a new world.

The French Revolution 法国大革命 was in different ways both kinds of revolution -- in the end, an absolutist 专制主义的 government was replaced by an absolutist government.

But the change that emerged from the revolution was real and lasting 持久的.

It helped usher in 引入；迎来 a world where people saw themselves as citizens 公民 of a community rather than subjects 臣民 of a king.

And eventually, a rising military star named Napoleon Bonaparte 拿破仑·波拿巴 would prove that having your dad be king of France was not the only way to become ruler 统治者 of France.



[Intro]

Napoleon grew up poor in Corsica 科西嘉岛, but he loved reading and managed to secure 获得 a scholarship 奖学金 to a military academy 军校.

As a kid, he spoke Corsican 科西嘉语 and Italian and didn't start learning French until he was ten.

And he was bullied 欺负 for his accented 带口音的 French and for his overall tininess 矮小 -- although despite what you may have heard about Napoleon complexes 拿破仑情结, Bonaparte would eventually end up being around five feet seven inches tall, about average for an 18th century man.

He entered the army as a second lieutenant 少尉 in 1785 and began to rise through the ranks 晋升 throughout the tumultuous 动荡的 years of the French Revolution.

By the time he was 24, in 1793, he was a brigadier general 准将 working under the Committee for Public Safety 公共安全委员会, which as you'll recall killed a lot of the public in the name of public safety 以公共安全的名义.

And then in 1798, Napoleon crossed into Egypt with an entire army at his command 由他指挥, aiming to disrupt 破坏 Britain's access to 通往…的通道 India.

In addition to 除…之外 lots of soldiers, Napoleon brought with him scientists, linguists 语言学家, and other scholars 学者 to advance knowledge and also carry off 拿走 more Egyptian riches.

The Egyptians were impressed by the openness of these scholars, but in general the French completely appalled 使震惊 the local people with their crude 粗鲁的 ways and drunkenness 醉酒.

And even as Napoleon flattered 奉承 the Egyptians by declaring himself a worshiper 崇拜者 of Islam 伊斯兰教, he ultimately 最终地 stole and desecrated 亵渎 many Egyptian artifacts 文物 -- although later he also stole and desecrated lots of artifacts from around Europe.

He loved a plundered 掠夺的 artifact!

At any rate 无论如何, Napoleon ultimately had to return to France in 1799, as his army and navy were defeated by the British and the Egyptians.

And that timing turned out to be perfect: The Directory 督政府, which you'll recall was a five-person committee governing France after the collapse of Robespierre's Committee for Public Safety, was overseeing 监督 a still-floundering 挣扎的 economy and fighting wars on many fronts 多条战线.

Napoleon helped overthrow 推翻 the directorate in 1799, and quickly became "First Consul 第一执政官," and then took as his first task mending fences with 与…修复关系 the Catholic Church 天主教会.

He agreed to the Concordat of 1801 1801年政教协议, which recognized Catholicism 天主教 as the primary 主要的 French religion.

It also validated 使生效 the sale of Church lands and the state's payment of clergymen's salaries if they swore to uphold 支持 the French government.

And that was important because it ensured him the support of one of France's most important institutions 机构, and you'll recall our discussions about how even dictators 独裁者 need support from within their holdings 领地.

But it's also telling 说明问题的 that Napoleon would eventually be excommunicated 逐出教会 by the Catholic Church for annexing 吞并 papal lands 教皇领地 for France.

Napoleon was also popular with the people: He offered a solution to decades of instability 不稳定 and economic decline 衰退.

He won majorities 多数票 when he had his candidacy 候选人资格 for office and other decisions approved by a plebiscite 公民投票 or vote, cast by men over the age of 21.

In 1802 he had himself declared Consul for Life 终身执政官 and in 1804 Emperor 皇帝.

Did the center of the world just open up?

Is there a bust 半身像 of somebody who actually believes himself to be the center of the world in there?

It is!
It's Napoleon himself.

Stan got this in Paris.

I can tell, because it says, "Souvenir de Paris."

So this bust of Napoleon complete with its armlessness 无手臂 and being cut off at the torso 躯干截断 and everything is extremely Roman-ish 罗马风格的.

And this was part of how Napoleon justified 为…辩解 his dictatorial 独裁的 form of government.

He said "no, we're just going back to the Roman Empire...to the good old days of ancient Rome."

And dictators do this a lot.

From the Russian word Tsar 沙皇, which comes from the word Caesar 凯撒, to 20th century dictators, when your leaders start talking about reviving 复兴 the glory of the Roman Empire, get nervous.

Oh look, it's half-French, half-Roman Napoleon.

So, during the French Revolution, leaders promoted the ancient Roman idea of virtue 美德 -- that is, the sacrifice 牺牲 of personal interest for the good of the republic 共和国, the whole.

Napoleon continued all that Roman imagery 意象 but switched it from the Roman Republic 罗马共和国 to the Roman Empire 罗马帝国.

You can even see this in his journey from being a Consul to being an Emperor.

He was portrayed 描绘 in lavish 奢华的 costume and crowned with the laurel leaves 月桂叶 of a conquering hero 征服者.

"Empire" style in furniture arose and women donned 穿上 slim white dresses, free from corsets 紧身胸衣 and voluminous 大量的 petticoats 衬裙, in imitation of 模仿 Roman statuary 雕塑.

And Napoleon saw himself as a modern Justinian 查士丁尼 -- the famed 著名的 ancient lawgiver 立法者.

So to that end 为此, he set out to 着手 have the most celebrated 著名的 jurists 法学家 under his guidance produce a rational 合理的 code of laws 法典.

Completed in 1804, the Code Napoléon (aka the Napoleonic Code 拿破仑法典) standardized 使标准化 the laws of citizenship, family, and property 财产.

The Code made rules for financial transfers 金融转账 and mortgages 抵押贷款 and for other legal transactions 法律交易 concerning property standards across France instead of differing from province to province 省与省之间不同.

And legal standardization 标准化 facilitated 促进 modern economic development.

But the other two sections on family and citizenship stunned 使震惊 many for the way they impoverished 使贫困 and curtailed 削减 most of the rights of women.

Under the Napoleonic Code, women had no right to their own property once they were married -- not even the wages they earned themselves.

They could not serve as witnesses 证人 in court nor have control over 控制 or guardianship 监护权 of their own children.

They had to live where their husband directed them to live.

If they committed adultery 通奸, they were sent to jail.

But men, in contrast 相比之下, would only be charged with a crime if they brought a sexual partner into the family home.

I'm not making this up.

Lest you think that history is simply a march toward more people having more rights...not always.

But by creating laws that specifically targeted 针对 the economy, the empire was seen as paving the way for 为…铺平道路 modernization 现代化.

And other institutions followed: individual schools were founded for higher education in engineering, science and technology, and for developing a cadre 骨干队伍 of advanced teachers.

Napoleon also sponsored 资助 the creation of lycées 公立中学, or high schools.

Countries in Europe and across the globe imitated 模仿 the French legal and educational systems as they too strove to 努力 become modern as well.

This may not seem like a huge deal, but consider how different the world becomes as more people have access to 有机会获得 more education:

There are more potential innovators 创新者 to solve big problems, and more people who can use the tool of writing to share their perspectives 观点 with wide audiences, and more teachers to train and educate future generations of professionals and experts.

On the other hand, it's worth remembering that half of the population -- women -- were denied 被剥夺 not just most of the new opportunities in France but also many of the rights they'd previously had.

So, Napoleon initially 最初 succeeded in France because he quelled 平息 the political chaos 政治混乱 by making himself an emblem 象征 of authority 权威 and order.

Right out of the dictator playbook 独裁者的套路.

He also created a police state 警察国家 with strict censorship 严格审查 and spies operating in everyday life.

And he restored 恢复 the monarchical 君主制的 system of aristocratic titles 贵族头衔 and hierarchies 等级制度, even giving back titles to some of the old aristocracy who could help revive the appearance of ceremonial grandeur 仪式的庄严.

And so in all those ways, Napoleon was returning to Louis XIV's absolutism 专制主义, so the revolution did turn all the way around, ending where it started, in that sense.

While members of Napoleon's family often became wealthy and titled 有头衔的, his enemies were frequently exiled from 被流放 France.

The most famous of his exiled enemies was Germaine de Staël 热尔曼·德·斯塔尔, the wealthiest woman in Europe and one of the most accomplished 有成就的.

De Staël never stopped criticizing the dictator, although at first she found him fascinating and even thought she might become his companion 伴侣.

Early on, she probed 试探 him for an expression of admiration of her talents by asking what kind of woman he valued most.

He responded, "the one with the most children" and pointedly 尖锐地 gazed at 盯着 her chest.

After that, she denounced 谴责 his brutal 残忍的 nature to whoever would listen, rallying 召集 opponents around her.

But Napoleon had as many plans for Europe as he had for France and he set out to 着手 conquer 征服 and colonize 殖民 all of Europe and the British Isles 不列颠群岛.

He amassed 聚集 a huge army by drafting 征召 young men between the ages of 20 and 24, then he earned their complete devotion 忠诚 by fighting alongside 与…并肩作战 them in at least sixty battles.

As he conquered German and Austrian territory 领土, he brought men from those areas into his armies too.

And by 1806, he had ended the Holy Roman Empire 神圣罗马帝国 after defeating Austria in several battles, most thoroughly 彻底地 at the battle of Austerlitz 奥斯特利茨战役 in 1805.

Then he went on to defeat Prussia in 1806 and Russia in 1807 after they declared war on 向…宣战 France in succession 接连地.

Napoleon then forced or inspired reforms such as the end of serfdom 农奴制, legislating 立法 religious toleration 宗教宽容, and creating schools to advance scientific and technological study.

And he unified 统一 German states excluding 不包括 Austria in the Confederation of the Rhine 莱茵邦联.

His imposition 推行 of the Napoleonic Code, the metric system 公制, and other institutions for standardization helped to unify Europe.

What is the metric system?

Stan says it's something that Europeans do, like soccer and ensuring that all citizens have health care.

One of the big effects of Napoleon's European ambitions 野心 was that it inspired a lot of nationalism 民族主义 among his new subjects 臣民, who mostly opposed his dictatorial regimes 政权, in places where one of his brothers usually ruled.

I mean, for one thing, most of these newly conquered lands were run by one of Napoleon's brothers, who'd serve as surrogate 代理的 monarch, and if you're gonna live in a dictatorship 独裁统治, you wanna at least be dictated by the dictator himself.

Not some brother.

It's like going to see the matinee 日场演出 of a big Broadway show, and instead of getting the big star, you get some understudy 替补演员.

At any rate, this is important because people began to think of themselves as, for instance, German in part because they didn't want to think of themselves as French.

Napoleon's goal was to colonize the entire continent 大陆, and he mostly succeeded, but Spain was still unconquered 未被征服的 and thwarting 阻挠 his Continental system 大陆封锁体系 when in 1807 Napoleon struck with an army of some 100,000 men.

Spanish and Portuguese royals 王室成员 both left their capitals.

Napoleon installed 任命 yet another brother (Joseph) as king and resistance swelled 高涨 -- with help from the British and Arthur Wellesley, who would later become the Duke of Wellington 威灵顿公爵.

And you can see the effects in art.

Jacques-Louis David painted triumphant 胜利的 moments in Napoleon's career, including his self-coronation 自我加冕 as emperor.

But Spanish painter Francisco Goya depicted 描绘 Napoleonic rule as a reign of terror 恐怖统治.

His "Third of May 1808" shows a French firing squad 行刑队 mowing down 扫射 peasants and clergy alike.

Goya remained a chronicler 记录者 of Spanish resistance and French barbarism 野蛮行为, as tens of thousands of French troops had to occupy the conquered kingdom because of Spanish hatred of the conquerors.



Let's go to the Thought Bubble.


Despite ongoing problems, Napoleon became determined to conquer and absorb 吞并 all of Russia,

especially since it had opted out of 退出 his Continental System.

He built an army of some 600,000 to 700,000 men from across his lands

and began his invasion 入侵 in June of 1812.

Having trudged 跋涉 hundreds of miles, troops were exhausted 疲惫的 and overcome by the heat,

and the Russians refused to engage in battle 交战.

Instead, they retreated 撤退, practicing so-called "scorched earth tactics 焦土战术" by burning and destroying any resource

including food and livestock 牲畜 that could be of use to the invaders.

Finally at Borodino 博罗季诺, the two sides engaged in what was ultimately a costly victory for the French,

who lost 30,000 men, while the Russians lost 45,000.

But the French were thousands of miles from home territory, and so reinforcing 增援 and resupplying 补给 their army proved difficult.

Foreign recruits 新兵, who were not as loyal to Napoleon, began melting away 逐渐消失 as winter approached and conditions worsened.

The remaining 100,000ish invaders marched on from Borodino, some 70 miles from Moscow,

but on reaching their destination, they found the city consumed by fire

-- shelter 住所 and other necessities were once again in short supply 短缺.

Still Napoleon waited for Tsar Alexander I to surrender 投降 and agree to terms 同意条件.

But when the surrender failed to materialize 实现,

Napoleon led his depleted 疲惫不堪的, starving, and frostbitten 冻伤的 army westward to Poland.

Many had died; many other soldiers had deserted  deserted  desert 逃跑, and more French troops would be killed by the Cossacks 哥萨克人 as they retreated.

Only 40,000 of Napoleon's soldiers reached Poland alive in 1813.



Thanks Thought Bubble.


So, the European powers took note of 注意到 the Emperor's bedraggled 狼狈的 forces and formed a coalition 联盟 that included Russia, Austria, Prussia, and Sweden.

In 1813, their armies, backed by 由…支持 British financing 资金, defeated French forces at Leipzig 莱比锡.

This battle was waged 进行 because Napoleon refused to accept the allies' terms, which initially 最初 allowed him to continue to rule France.

In early 1814 he abdicated 退位 and headed for exile 流放 on Elba 厄尔巴岛, an island in the Mediterranean 地中海.

A year later, he escaped, returned to France, gathered an army, and confronted 对抗 the powers once more, finally surrendering on July 15, 1815 after being defeated at Waterloo 滑铁卢.

Napoleon was living in exile on the distant island of St. Helena 圣赫勒拿岛 when he died on May 5, 1821 -- thirty two years to the day after the meeting of the Estates-General 三级会议 that set the French Revolution into motion 发动.

Consider all that had happened in those 32 years, and you'll understand why this period of French history is seen as so important to world history.

Decades after his death, Napoleon's remains 遗体 were lavishly 奢华地 returned to France, placed in the Church of the Dome 荣军院圆顶教堂 in the heart of Paris, and eventually re-encased 重新装殓 in a grander sarcophagus 石棺 under the church's golden dome itself.

Why?
Remember that under him, French achievements were massive 巨大的 in terms of education, commitment to 致力于 science, standardization 标准化, modernization of the economy and administration 行政管理, and opening the door to opportunity 打开机会之门 for ordinary people.

Well, ordinary men.

French museums were packed with loot 战利品 from across Europe and Egypt plundered by Napoleon's armies.

In fact, those museums are still packed with that loot.

And there were also the unforgettable early military victories and the revival 复兴 of French cultural glory that led to the imitation 模仿 of French things throughout the world.

Muhammad Ali 穆罕默德·阿里, ruler of Egypt Muhammad Ali, ruler of Egypt, who had been part of the effort to drive Napoleon and his forces from the country, would begin programs in direct imitation of Napoleon's.

And the creation of a truly citizens army 公民军队, entranced 使着迷 by the heroism 英雄主义 of its leader, also endured 持续, while his lightning attacks 闪电战 remained a model to future military innovators 创新者.

The Napoleonic Code 拿破仑法典 was imitated worldwide.

As Napoleon's body was re-entombed 重新安葬 in splendor 华丽；壮观 and pomp 盛况, one worker expressed France's general worship 崇拜 of the dictator: "I've got the emperor in my guts."

For better and for worse 无论好坏, we still have Napoleon in our guts.

Thanks for watching.

I'll see you next time.

大家好，我是约翰·格林，这里是《速成欧洲史》。 + 
 + 
“革命”（revolution）这个词很有意思，因为它字面上的意思是完整的360度旋转。 + 
就好像，一场革命结束时又回到了起点。 + 
但在历史中，革命意味着根本性的变革，与过去的世界彻底决裂，以及对新世界的混乱且往往伴随着暴力的接纳。 + 
法国大革命（French Revolution）在不同方面兼具这两种革命的特征——最终，一个专制政府被另一个专制政府所取代。 + 
但这场革命带来的变化是真实且持久的。 + 
它推动了一个新的世界的到来，在这个世界里，人们将自己视为一个共同体的公民，而非国王的臣民。 + 
最终，一位冉冉升起的军事新星拿破仑·波拿巴（Napoleon Bonaparte）将证明，要成为法国的统治者，父亲是法国国王并不是唯一的途径。 + 
 + 
[开场介绍] + 
 + 
拿破仑在科西嘉岛（Corsica）的贫困环境中长大，但他热爱读书，并设法获得了一所军事学院的奖学金。 + 
小时候，他说科西嘉语和意大利语，直到十岁才开始学习法语。 + 
他因为法语口音以及身材矮小而受到欺负——尽管你可能听说过关于拿破仑情结（Napoleon complexes）的说法，但波拿巴最终的身高约为五英尺七英寸，对于18世纪的男性来说，这大约是平均身高。 + 
1785年，他以少尉军衔参军，在法国大革命动荡的那些年里，他开始逐步晋升。 + 
到1793年，他24岁的时候，已经是公共安全委员会（Committee for Public Safety）下属的一名准将了，你可能还记得，公共安全委员会曾以公共安全的名义处决了很多民众。 + 
然后在1798年，拿破仑率领一整支军队进军埃及（Egypt），旨在切断英国通往印度（India）的通道。 + 
除了大量士兵之外，拿破仑还带上了科学家、语言学家和其他学者，以便增进知识，同时也掠夺更多埃及的财富。 + 
埃及人对这些学者的开放态度印象深刻，但总体而言，法国人粗鲁的行为和酗酒的习惯让当地人大为震惊。 + 
尽管拿破仑宣称自己是伊斯兰教（Islam）的信徒来讨好埃及人，但他最终还是偷走并亵渎了许多埃及文物——不过后来他也从欧洲各地偷走并亵渎了大量文物。 + 
他就喜欢掠夺来的文物！ + 
无论如何，1799年拿破仑最终不得不返回法国，因为他的陆军和海军被英国人和埃及人击败了。 + 
而这个时机却恰到好处：督政府（Directory），你可能还记得，这是在罗伯斯庇尔（Robespierre）的公共安全委员会倒台后管理法国的一个五人委员会，当时它正面临着仍然摇摇欲坠的经济状况，并且在多条战线上作战。 + 
1799年，拿破仑协助推翻了督政府，并迅速成为“第一执政”（First Consul），然后他将与天主教会（Catholic Church）修复关系作为首要任务。 + 
他同意了1801年的《教务专约》（Concordat of 1801），该条约承认天主教为法国的主要宗教。 + 
它还确认了教会土地的出售，以及如果神职人员宣誓支持法国政府，国家将支付他们的薪水。 + 
这很重要，因为这确保了他能得到法国最重要的机构之一的支持，而且你还记得我们之前讨论过，即使是独裁者也需要得到其统治范围内的支持。 + 
但同样值得注意的是，拿破仑最终会因为为法国吞并教皇领地而被天主教会逐出教会。 + 
拿破仑也深受民众欢迎：他为几十年来的不稳定和经济衰退提供了一个解决方案。 + 
当他通过公民投票（plebiscite），即由21岁以上的男性投票，使自己的任职资格和其他决策得到批准时，他赢得了多数票。 + 
1802年，他宣布自己为终身执政（Consul for Life），1804年称帝（Emperor）。 + 
世界的中心刚刚打开了吗？ + 
里面是不是有某个自认为是世界中心的人的半身像呢？ + 
还真有！ + 
是拿破仑本人。 + 
斯坦在巴黎（Paris）买的这个。 + 
我能看出来，因为上面写着“Souvenir de Paris”（巴黎纪念品）。 + 
所以这个拿破仑的半身像，没有手臂，躯干部分也是截断的，一切都极具罗马风格。 + 
而这也是拿破仑为他的独裁政府形式辩护的一部分理由。 + 
他说：“不，我们只是回到罗马帝国（Roman Empire）……回到古罗马（ancient Rome）的美好旧时光。” + 
独裁者经常会这样做。 + 
从俄语中的“沙皇”（Tsar）这个词，它来源于“凯撒”（Caesar）这个词，到20世纪的独裁者，当你的领导人开始谈论复兴罗马帝国的辉煌时，可要小心了。 + 
哦，看，这是半法国、半罗马风格的拿破仑。 + 
所以，在法国大革命期间，领导人宣扬古罗马的美德观念——也就是为了共和国这个整体的利益而牺牲个人利益。 + 
拿破仑延续了所有这些罗马元素，但把它从罗马共和国（Roman Republic）换成了罗马帝国。 + 
你甚至可以从他从执政到称帝的历程中看到这一点。 + 
他身着华丽的服饰，头戴象征着征服英雄的月桂叶皇冠。 + 
“帝国”（Empire）风格的家具应运而生，女性们穿上了修身的白色连衣裙，摆脱了紧身胸衣和宽大的衬裙，模仿着罗马雕像的风格。 + 
拿破仑将自己视为现代的查士丁尼（Justinian）——那位著名的古代立法者。 + 
所以为此，他着手让在他指导下的最著名的法学家们制定一部合理的法典。 + 
1804年完成的《拿破仑法典》（Code Napoléon，又名the Napoleonic Code）对公民、家庭和财产方面的法律进行了标准化。 + 
该法典为法国各地的财产相关金融转让、抵押以及其他法律交易制定了规则，而不再是各省的法律各不相同。 + 
法律的标准化促进了现代经济的发展。 + 
但关于家庭和公民的另外两个部分却让许多人震惊，因为它们使女性变得更加贫困，并剥夺了她们的大部分权利。 + 
根据《拿破仑法典》，女性一旦结婚，就对自己的财产没有任何权利——甚至包括她们自己挣得的工资。 + 
她们不能在法庭上作证，也不能对自己的孩子进行控制或监护。 + 
她们必须住在丈夫指定的地方。 + 
如果她们通奸，就会被送进监狱。 + 
但相比之下，男性只有在将性伴侣带回家中的情况下才会被指控犯罪。 + 
我可不是在编造这些。 + 
以免你认为历史仅仅是朝着更多人拥有更多权利的方向前进……并非总是如此。 + 
但通过制定专门针对经济的法律，这个帝国被视为为现代化铺平了道路。 + 
其他机构也纷纷效仿：创办了专门的学校用于工程、科学和技术领域的高等教育，以及培养一批高水平的教师。 + 
拿破仑还资助创办了公立中学（lycées），即高中。 + 
欧洲和全球的国家都效仿法国的法律和教育体系，因为它们也在努力实现现代化。 + 
这可能看起来不是什么大事，但想想看，随着更多的人能够接受更多的教育，世界会变得多么不同： + 
会有更多潜在的创新者来解决重大问题，会有更多的人能够利用文字这一工具与广大受众分享他们的观点，也会有更多的教师来培训和教育未来一代的专业人士和专家。 + 
另一方面，值得记住的是，法国人口的一半——女性——不仅被剥夺了法国大多数新的机会，而且还失去了她们以前拥有的许多权利。 + 
所以，拿破仑最初在法国取得成功，是因为他通过让自己成为权威和秩序的象征，平息了政治混乱。 + 
完全是独裁者的套路。 + 
他还建立了一个警察国家，实行严格的审查制度，在日常生活中安插间谍。 + 
他恢复了带有贵族头衔和等级制度的君主制体系，甚至把一些头衔归还给了旧贵族中那些能够帮助恢复仪式威严表象的人。 + 
所以从所有这些方面来看，拿破仑又回到了路易十四（Louis XIV）的专制统治，从这个意义上说，革命确实又回到了起点，结束时又回到了开始的地方。 + 
拿破仑家族的成员常常变得富有并获得头衔，而他的敌人则经常被流放出法国。 + 
他被流放的敌人中最著名的是热尔曼娜·德·斯塔尔夫人（Germaine de Staël），她是欧洲最富有的女性之一，也是最有成就的女性之一。 + 
斯塔尔夫人从未停止过对这位独裁者的批评，尽管起初她觉得他很有魅力，甚至认为自己可能会成为他的伴侣。 + 
一开始，她通过询问他最看重什么样的女性，来试探他对自己才华的赞赏之情。 + 
他回答说：“孩子最多的那个”，并意味深长地盯着她的胸部。 + 
从那以后，她逢人便谴责他的残暴本性，团结起了反对他的人。 + 
但拿破仑对欧洲的计划和他对法国的计划一样多，他着手征服并殖民整个欧洲和不列颠群岛（British Isles）。 + 
他通过征召20到24岁的年轻人，组建了一支庞大的军队，然后通过在至少六十场战斗中与他们并肩作战，赢得了他们的绝对忠诚。 + 
在征服德意志（German）和奥地利（Austria）领土的过程中，他也将这些地区的人纳入了他的军队。 + 
到1806年，在几次战役中击败奥地利后，他终结了神圣罗马帝国（Holy Roman Empire），其中最具决定性的是1805年的奥斯特里茨战役（battle of Austerlitz）。 + 
随后，在普鲁士（Prussia）和俄罗斯（Russia）相继对法国宣战后，他又分别于1806年和1807年击败了普鲁士和俄罗斯。 + 
拿破仑随后推动或促成了一些改革，比如废除农奴制（serfdom）、立法保障宗教宽容（religious toleration），以及创办学校以促进科学技术研究。 + 
他将除奥地利之外的德意志各邦统一在莱茵邦联（Confederation of the Rhine）之下。 + 
他推行《拿破仑法典》、公制（metric system）以及其他标准化制度，有助于欧洲的统一。 + 
什么是公制呢？ + 
斯坦说这是欧洲人做的事情，就像踢足球和确保所有公民都有医疗保障一样。 + 
拿破仑的欧洲野心带来的一个重大影响是，在他新统治的地区，激发了大量的民族主义情绪，这些地区大多由他的某个兄弟统治，而人们大多反对他的独裁政权。 + 
我的意思是，一方面，这些新征服的土地大多由拿破仑的某个兄弟管理，他们充当着代理君主的角色，而如果你要生活在一个独裁政权下，你至少希望是由独裁者本人来统治。 + 
而不是某个兄弟。 + 
这就好比去看一场百老汇大剧的日场演出，结果没看到大明星，而是看到了某个替补演员。 + 
无论如何，这很重要，因为人们开始认为自己是德意志人，部分原因是他们不想认为自己是法国人。 + 
拿破仑的目标是殖民整个欧洲大陆，他在很大程度上取得了成功，但西班牙（Spain）仍未被征服，并且在1807年拿破仑率领约10万名士兵进攻时，西班牙阻碍了他的大陆封锁体系（Continental system）。 + 
西班牙和葡萄牙（Portuguese）的王室都离开了他们的首都。 + 
拿破仑又让他的一个兄弟（约瑟夫，Joseph）当了国王，抵抗情绪随之高涨——在英国人以及亚瑟·韦尔斯利（Arthur Wellesley）的帮助下，韦尔斯利后来成为了威灵顿公爵（Duke of Wellington）。 + 
你可以从艺术作品中看到这些影响。 + 
雅克-路易·大卫（Jacques-Louis David）描绘了拿破仑职业生涯中的辉煌时刻，包括他为自己加冕称帝的场景。 + 
但西班牙画家弗朗西斯科·戈雅（Francisco Goya）则将拿破仑的统治描绘成恐怖统治（reign of terror）。 + 
他的画作《1808年5月3日》（“Third of May 1808”）描绘了一队法国行刑队扫射农民和神职人员的场景。 + 
戈雅继续记录着西班牙的抵抗和法国的野蛮行径，由于西班牙人对征服者的仇恨，成千上万的法国军队不得不占领这个被征服的王国。 + 
 + 
让我们进入“思想泡泡”环节。 + 
尽管存在着持续的问题，拿破仑还是决心征服并吞并整个俄罗斯， + 
尤其是因为俄罗斯选择退出了他的大陆封锁体系。 + 
他从自己统治的各个地区组建了一支约60万到70万人的军队 + 
并于1812年6月开始了他的入侵。 + 
长途跋涉数百英里后，士兵们疲惫不堪，酷热难耐， + 
而俄罗斯人拒绝交战。 + 
相反，他们撤退了，采取了所谓的“焦土战术”（scorched earth tactics），焚烧并摧毁任何可能对入侵者有用的资源 + 
包括食物和牲畜。 + 
最终在博罗季诺（Borodino），双方展开了一场战斗，对法国人来说，这最终是一场代价高昂的胜利， + 
法国人损失了3万人，而俄罗斯人损失了4.5万人。 + 
但法国人远离本土数千英里，因此事实证明，要补充兵力和物资供应非常困难。 + 
对拿破仑忠诚度不高的外国新兵，随着冬天的临近和条件的恶化开始逐渐逃离。 + 
剩下的大约10万名入侵者从距离莫斯科约70英里的博罗季诺继续前进， + 
但到达目的地时，他们发现这座城市已被大火吞噬 + 
——住所和其他必需品再次短缺。 + 
拿破仑仍然在等待沙皇亚历山大一世（Tsar Alexander I）投降并接受条件。 + 
但当投降没有实现时， + 
拿破仑带领他疲惫不堪、饥肠辘辘且饱受冻伤的军队向西前往波兰（Poland）。 +

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

So, the word revolution is a funny one, because it literally means a full turn of 360 degrees.

Like, you end a revolution where you started out.

But in history, revolution means radical change, stark departures from the world that was, and the messy, often violent embrace of a new world.

The French Revolution was in different ways both kinds of revolution -- in the end, an absolutist government was replaced by an absolutist government.

But the change that emerged from the revolution was real and lasting.

It helped usher in a world where people saw themselves as citizens of a community rather than subjects of a king.

And eventually, a rising military star named Napoleon Bonaparte would prove that having your dad be king of France was not the only way to become ruler of France.

[Intro]

Napoleon grew up poor in Corsica, but he loved reading and managed to secure a scholarship to a military academy.

As a kid, he spoke Corsican and Italian and didn't start learning French until he was ten.

And he was bullied for his accented French and for his overall tininess -- although despite what you may have heard about Napoleon complexes, Bonaparte would eventually end up being around five feet seven inches tall, about average for an 18th century man.

He entered the army as a second lieutenant in 1785 and began to rise through the ranks throughout the tumultuous years of the French Revolution.

By the time he was 24, in 1793, he was a brigadier general working under the Committee for Public Safety, which as you'll recall killed a lot of the public in the name of public safety.

And then in 1798, Napoleon crossed into Egypt with an entire army at his command, aiming to disrupt Britain's access to India.

In addition to lots of soldiers, Napoleon brought with him scientists, linguists, and other scholars to advance knowledge and also carry off more Egyptian riches.

The Egyptians were impressed by the openness of these scholars, but in general the French completely appalled the local people with their crude ways and drunkenness.

And even as Napoleon flattered the Egyptians by declaring himself a worshiper of Islam, he ultimately stole and desecrated many Egyptian artifacts -- although later he also stole and desecrated lots of artifacts from around Europe.

He loved a plundered artifact!

At any rate, Napoleon ultimately had to return to France in 1799, as his army and navy were defeated by the British and the Egyptians.

And that timing turned out to be perfect: The Directory, which you'll recall was a five-person committee governing France after the collapse of Robespierre's Committee for Public Safety, was overseeing a still-floundering economy and fighting wars on many fronts.

Napoleon helped overthrow the directorate in 1799, and quickly became "First Consul," and then took as his first task mending fences with the Catholic Church.

He agreed to the Concordat of 1801, which recognized Catholicism as the primary French religion.

It also validated the sale of Church lands and the state's payment of clergymen's salaries if they swore to uphold the French government.

And that was important because it ensured him the support of one of France's most important institutions, and you'll recall our discussions about how even dictators need support from within their holdings.

But it's also telling that Napoleon would eventually be excommunicated by the Catholic Church for annexing papal lands for France.

Napoleon was also popular with the people: He offered a solution to decades of instability and economic decline.

He won majorities when he had his candidacy for office and other decisions approved by a plebiscite or vote, cast by men over the age of 21.

In 1802 he had himself declared Consul for Life and in 1804 Emperor.

Did the center of the world just open up?

Is there a bust of somebody who actually believes himself to be the center of the world in there?

It is!

It's Napoleon himself.

Stan got this in Paris.

I can tell, because it says, "Souvenir de Paris."

So this bust of Napoleon complete with its armlessness and being cut off at the torso and everything is extremely Roman-ish.

And this was part of how Napoleon justified his dictatorial form of government.

He said "no, we're just going back to the Roman Empire...to the good old days of ancient Rome."

And dictators do this a lot.

From the Russian word Tsar, which comes from the word Caesar, to 20th century dictators, when your leaders start talking about reviving the glory of the Roman Empire, get nervous.

Oh look, it's half-French, half-Roman Napoleon.

So, during the French Revolution, leaders promoted the ancient Roman idea of virtue -- that is, the sacrifice of personal interest for the good of the republic, the whole.

Napoleon continued all that Roman imagery but switched it from the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire.

You can even see this in his journey from being a Consul to being an Emperor.

He was portrayed in lavish costume and crowned with the laurel leaves of a conquering hero.

"Empire" style in furniture arose and women donned slim white dresses, free from corsets and voluminous petticoats, in imitation of Roman statuary.

And Napoleon saw himself as a modern Justinian -- the famed ancient lawgiver.

So to that end, he set out to have the most celebrated jurists under his guidance produce a rational code of laws.

Completed in 1804, the Code Napoléon (aka the Napoleonic Code) standardized the laws of citizenship, family, and property.

The Code made rules for financial transfers and mortgages and for other legal transactions concerning property standards across France instead of differing from province to province.

And legal standardization facilitated modern economic development.

But the other two sections on family and citizenship stunned many for the way they impoverished and curtailed most of the rights of women.

Under the Napoleonic Code, women had no right to their own property once they were married -- not even the wages they earned themselves.

They could not serve as witnesses in court nor have control over or guardianship of their own children.

They had to live where their husband directed them to live.

If they committed adultery, they were sent to jail.

But men, in contrast, would only be charged with a crime if they brought a sexual partner into the family home.

I'm not making this up.

Lest you think that history is simply a march toward more people having more rights...not always.

But by creating laws that specifically targeted the economy, the empire was seen as paving the way for modernization.

And other institutions followed: individual schools were founded for higher education in engineering, science and technology, and for developing a cadre of advanced teachers.

Napoleon also sponsored the creation of lycées, or high schools.

Countries in Europe and across the globe imitated the French legal and educational systems as they too strove to become modern as well.

This may not seem like a huge deal, but consider how different the world becomes as more people have access to more education:

There are more potential innovators to solve big problems, and more people who can use the tool of writing to share their perspectives with wide audiences, and more teachers to train and educate future generations of professionals and experts.

On the other hand, it's worth remembering that half of the population -- women -- were denied not just most of the new opportunities in France but also many of the rights they'd previously had.

So, Napoleon initially succeeded in France because he quelled the political chaos by making himself an emblem of authority and order.

Right out of the dictator playbook.

He also created a police state with strict censorship and spies operating in everyday life.

And he restored the monarchical system of aristocratic titles and hierarchies, even giving back titles to some of the old aristocracy who could help revive the appearance of ceremonial grandeur.

And so in all those ways, Napoleon was returning to Louis XIV's absolutism, so the revolution did turn all the way around, ending where it started, in that sense.

While members of Napoleon's family often became wealthy and titled, his enemies were frequently exiled from France.

The most famous of his exiled enemies was Germaine de Staël, the wealthiest woman in Europe and one of the most accomplished.

De Staël never stopped criticizing the dictator, although at first she found him fascinating and even thought she might become his companion.

Early on, she probed him for an expression of admiration of her talents by asking what kind of woman he valued most.

He responded, "the one with the most children" and pointedly gazed at her chest.

After that, she denounced his brutal nature to whoever would listen, rallying opponents around her.

But Napoleon had as many plans for Europe as he had for France and he set out to conquer and colonize all of Europe and the British Isles.

He amassed a huge army by drafting young men between the ages of 20 and 24, then he earned their complete devotion by fighting alongside them in at least sixty battles.

As he conquered German and Austrian territory, he brought men from those areas into his armies too.

And by 1806, he had ended the Holy Roman Empire after defeating Austria in several battles, most thoroughly at the battle of Austerlitz in 1805.

Then he went on to defeat Prussia in 1806 and Russia in 1807 after they declared war on France in succession.

Napoleon then forced or inspired reforms such as the end of serfdom, legislating religious toleration, and creating schools to advance scientific and technological study.

And he unified German states excluding Austria in the Confederation of the Rhine.

His imposition of the Napoleonic Code, the metric system, and other institutions for standardization helped to unify Europe.

What is the metric system?

Stan says it's something that Europeans do, like soccer and ensuring that all citizens have health care.

One of the big effects of Napoleon's European ambitions was that it inspired a lot of nationalism among his new subjects, who mostly opposed his dictatorial regimes, in places where one of his brothers usually ruled.

I mean, for one thing, most of these newly conquered lands were run by one of Napoleon's brothers, who'd serve as surrogate monarch, and if you're gonna live in a dictatorship, you wanna at least be dictated by the dictator himself.

Not some brother.

It's like going to see the matinee of a big Broadway show, and instead of getting the big star, you get some understudy.

At any rate, this is important because people began to think of themselves as, for instance, German in part because they didn't want to think of themselves as French.

Napoleon's goal was to colonize the entire continent, and he mostly succeeded, but Spain was still unconquered and thwarting his Continental system when in 1807 Napoleon struck with an army of some 100,000 men.

Spanish and Portuguese royals both left their capitals.

Napoleon installed yet another brother (Joseph) as king and resistance swelled -- with help from the British and Arthur Wellesley, who would later become the Duke of Wellington.

And you can see the effects in art.

Jacques-Louis David painted triumphant moments in Napoleon's career, including his self-coronation as emperor.

But Spanish painter Francisco Goya depicted Napoleonic rule as a reign of terror.

His "Third of May 1808" shows a French firing squad mowing down peasants and clergy alike.

Goya remained a chronicler of Spanish resistance and French barbarism, as tens of thousands of French troops had to occupy the conquered kingdom because of Spanish hatred of the conquerors.

Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

Despite ongoing problems, Napoleon became determined to conquer and absorb all of Russia,
especially since it had opted out of his Continental System.
He built an army of some 600,000 to 700,000 men from across his lands
and began his invasion in June of 1812.
Having trudged hundreds of miles, troops were exhausted and overcome by the heat,
and the Russians refused to engage in battle.
Instead, they retreated, practicing so-called "scorched earth tactics" by burning and destroying any resource
including food and livestock that could be of use to the invaders.
Finally at Borodino, the two sides engaged in what was ultimately a costly victory for the French,
who lost 30,000 men, while the Russians lost 45,000.
But the French were thousands of miles from home territory, and so reinforcing and resupplying their army proved difficult.
Foreign recruits, who were not as loyal to Napoleon, began melting away as winter approached and conditions worsened.
The remaining 100,000ish invaders marched on from Borodino, some 70 miles from Moscow,
but on reaching their destination, they found the city consumed by fire
-- shelter and other necessities were once again in short supply.
Still Napoleon waited for Tsar Alexander I to surrender and agree to terms.
But when the surrender failed to materialize,
Napoleon led his depleted, starving, and frostbitten army westward to Poland.
Many had died; many other soldiers had deserted, and more French troops would be killed by the Cossacks as they retreated.
Only 40,000 of Napoleon's soldiers reached Poland alive in 1813.
Thanks Thought Bubble.

So, the European powers took note of the Emperor's bedraggled forces and formed a coalition that included Russia, Austria, Prussia, and Sweden.

In 1813, their armies, backed by British financing, defeated French forces at Leipzig.

This battle was waged because Napoleon refused to accept the allies' terms, which initially allowed him to continue to rule France.

In early 1814 he abdicated and headed for exile on Elba, an island in the Mediterranean.

A year later, he escaped, returned to France, gathered an army, and confronted the powers once more, finally surrendering on July 15, 1815 after being defeated at Waterloo.

Napoleon was living in exile on the distant island of St. Helena when he died on May 5, 1821 -- thirty two years to the day after the meeting of the Estates-General that set the French Revolution into motion.

Consider all that had happened in those 32 years, and you'll understand why this period of French history is seen as so important to world history.

Decades after his death, Napoleon's remains were lavishly returned to France, placed in the Church of the Dome in the heart of Paris, and eventually re-encased in a grander sarcophagus under the church's golden dome itself.

Why?

Remember that under him, French achievements were massive in terms of education, commitment to science, standardization, modernization of the economy and administration, and opening the door to opportunity for ordinary people.

Well, ordinary men.

French museums were packed with loot from across Europe and Egypt plundered by Napoleon's armies.

In fact, those museums are still packed with that loot.

And there were also the unforgettable early military victories and the revival of French cultural glory that led to the imitation of French things throughout the world.

Muhammad Ali, ruler of Egypt, who had been part of the effort to drive Napoleon and his forces from the country, would begin programs in direct imitation of Napoleon's.

And the creation of a truly citizens army, entranced by the heroism of its leader, also endured, while his lightning attacks remained a model to future military innovators.

The Napoleonic Code was imitated worldwide.

As Napoleon's body was re-entombed in splendor and pomp, one worker expressed France's general worship of the dictator: "I've got the emperor in my guts."

For better and for worse, we still have Napoleon in our guts.

Thanks for watching.

I'll see you next time.
