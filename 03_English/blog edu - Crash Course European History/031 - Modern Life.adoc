Hi, I'm John Green 约翰·格林, and this is Crash Course European History 欧洲历史速成课. +

So, we've come a long way 我们已经走过了漫长的道路: Electric-powered street cars 电动有轨电车, gas lighting of urban avenues 城市街道的煤气照明, crowded railway hubs 拥挤的铁路枢纽, vast outdoor cafés 大型户外咖啡馆, and workers in their Sunday best 身着节日盛装的工人 strolling through parks and along broad new boulevards 漫步公园、沿着宽阔的新林荫大道 -- all of this signaled 预示；表明 the arrival of modern life 现代生活 in European cities. +

And those cities swelled 膨胀；扩大 because of massive internal migration 大规模国内迁徙 from rural areas 农村地区 to capitals such as Berlin 柏林, which grew to over four million people by the end of the 19th century. +

Today we're covering the leap to modern life and what exactly "modern life" meant -- and as we've seen so many times in our study of history, what it meant depends upon perspective 视角, both for those living in 19th century Europe and for those of us today looking back on it. +

[Intro] +

In 1885, German engineer Karl Benz 卡尔·本茨 invented an internal combustion engine 内燃机; six years later, French manufacturer Armand Peugeot 阿尔芒·标致 produced a functioning automobile 汽车, bringing further speed to everyday life in cities. +

Initially 最初, doctors and their far-flung 遥远的；分布广泛的 patients were the people who benefited most from these new cars, while bicycles gave ordinary people a new-found sense of freedom and adventure 自由和冒险的新感觉, and also an opportunity to break their wrists 摔断手腕的机会. +

And alongside revolutions in transportation and lighting and many others, there was also a chemical revolution 化学革命 taking place around 1900, which led to synthetic drugs 合成药物. +

Like, German pharmaceutical company 制药公司 Bayer 拜耳 produced the first aspirin 阿司匹林 to help alleviate pain 减轻疼痛. Did the globe just open? +

GLOBE +

It says right here on this bottle of Bayer aspirin, #NOTSPON, "The Wonder Drug 神奇药物." And it really is! +

So, before aspirin, pain was treated primarily with opioids 阿片类药物 like morphine 吗啡 and codeine 可待因. But aspirin differed from opioids in many important ways. For one thing 一方面, it wasn't addictive 成瘾的, but also, it reduced fevers and inflammation 炎症. +

But what's most amazing about aspirin is that even though it was one of the first synthetic drugs, it's still super useful. It is an effective pain reliever 止痛药 even 120 years later. +

OK, let's turn our attention to the big trends of early 20th century Europe. +

So, across Europe, populations continued to grow despite the emigration 移民 to distant continents 遥远的大陆 that we talked about last time, but populations weren't going up because people were having more babies. In fact 事实上, the opposite was true. +

Europe experienced a "birth control revolution 生育控制革命" between 1880 and 1930. With very few regional exceptions 区域例外, in that fifty-year period, fertility rates 生育率 dropped some fifty percent because knowledge of birth control 生育控制知识 expanded thanks to a few occurrences 事件: better understanding of women's ovulatory cycles 排卵周期, the vulcanization of rubber 橡胶硫化 used in condoms 避孕套, and the invention of the cervical cap or diaphragm 宫颈帽或子宫帽. +

But population rose due to lower child mortality 儿童死亡率 and increased longevity 寿命延长. Breakthroughs 突破 like pasteurization 巴氏杀菌法 and greater understanding of germs 细菌 were just two scientific findings 科学发现 that helped extend life 延长寿命. +

There was also better sanitation 卫生设施, such as improved sewage systems 污水系统, which made people less likely to die of diseases like cholera 霍乱, which had ravaged 蹂躏；肆虐 European cities repeatedly 反复地 in the 18th and early 19th centuries. +

But still, this decline in fertility 生育率下降 gave politicians an issue that they could use to get votes: women, they claimed, were conducting a birth strike 生育罢工 which would lead to the decline in national strength 国力下降. +

It was true that women's lives were changing, as a "modern woman" began forging her own way 开辟自己的道路 outside the confines of the household 家庭的限制. Working women had already been laboring long hours for low wages 低工资长时间劳作, but now middle-class women, supposedly too fragile 脆弱的 and ignorant of the world 对世界无知 to work, began to take jobs. +

As industry, communications, marketing, and needed skills became more complex, women took jobs in the new service sector 服务行业. They became secretaries 秘书, sales clerks 售货员, telephone and telegraph operators 电话和电报接线员, teachers, and nurses. And they had the skills necessary to do these jobs thanks to the spreading system of public schools 公立学校体系, which taught literacy 识字 and basic mathematics 基础数学. +

If you wanna look for a single cause of why life is better today than it was 50 or 200 or 500 or 800 years ago... Public schools! +

But despite gains in education and employment, women were employed in the service sector because they could be paid less since they were seen as inferior 低等的；较差的 and not as skilled as men. +

Let's go to the Thought Bubble 思考泡泡. +

1. Obviously, the reputation women had for being inferior and less skilled was false. +
2. For instance 例如, women entered universities in the sciences and math -- which were open to them in part +
3. because at the time they were less prestigious 有声望的 and lucrative 赚钱的；有利可图的 than the Latin- and Greek-based humanities 基于拉丁语和希腊语的人文学科 dominated by men. +
4. Polish-born Marie Sklodowska-Curie 玛丽·斯克洛多夫斯卡·居里 was one of these new, scientific women, +
5. although the French Academy of Science 法国科学院 would not grant her membership 会员资格, +
6. even after she'd won two Nobel Prizes 诺贝尔奖 -- +
7. one for physics 物理学 and a second in chemistry 化学, making her the first person to win the prize in different fields 领域. +
8. It was widely believed that because she was a woman, her husband Pierre 皮埃尔 must have done the work for her. +
9. But for the record 郑重声明, Pierre Curie had been dead for five years when Marie won her second Nobel. +
10. She coined the term "radioactivity 放射性" and discovered +
11. two new chemical elements 化学元素, Polonium 钋 and Radium 镭. +
12. She also helped pioneer 开创；倡导 radiation treatment 放射治疗 for cancer +
13. before dying due to the high exposure to radiation 高辐射暴露 she experienced through her research. +
14. So-called "Modern" women like Curie challenged the established belief 既定观念 in women's incompetence 无能 and professional inferiority 职业低等, +
15. although the myth 错误观念；荒诞说法 prevailed 盛行；持续；占优势; +
16. in fact 事实上, it remains powerful today, +
17. moreso 更是如此 in the United States than in most other wealthy countries, +
18. as measured by UN 联合国 and OECD 经济合作与发展组织 statistics 统计数据. +

Thanks, Thought Bubble. +

So, changes in sexuality 性观念变化 accompanied 伴随 the rise of modern women. And this led to massive scandals 丑闻 and the creation of a new political tool, whereby 借此；通过 which politicians sought support by haranguing 斥责；抨击 the mostly male electorate 男性选民 about sin 罪恶 and the purportedly 据称；据说 declining morals 道德沦丧 of the age, as exemplified by 以…为例 the rise of women. +

And the fact that the male electorate was growing was another sign of modern life, indicating the development of so-called mass society 大众社会, which broadened 扩大 the number of people who had power and somewhat diluted 削弱；稀释 the power of elites 精英阶层的权力. +

Inventions like cheaper newsprint 新闻纸 also facilitated 促进；推动 mass society, because more people had access to 有机会获得 more information. But then as now 但当时和现在一样, the amount of information available was increasing, but not always the quality of that information. +

Also, then as now, sex scandals 性丑闻 were big news. Both true and fabricated stories 编造的故事 abounded 大量存在；充满. For example, successful author Oscar Wilde 奥斯卡·王尔德 was imprisoned 监禁 and widely condemned 谴责 because of his relationship with a young man. +

In members of the German Kaiser's 德国皇帝 entourage 随行人员, meanwhile 与此同时, high-ranking generals 高级将领 and other aristocrats 贵族 were found to be regularly cross-dressing 穿异性服装 and engaging in male-male relationships 同性关系. The press dramatized 渲染 that scandal so much that royal publicists 王室公关人员 had to reassure 使安心；安抚 the German public that the Kaiser himself had a healthy family life -- code 暗语；代号 at the time for heterosexuality 异性恋. +

In 1902, Friedrich Alfred Krupp 弗里德里希·阿尔弗雷德·克虏伯, owner of the famed arms manufacturer 著名军火制造商, committed suicide 自杀 when the press revealed 揭露 his relationships with young Italian men. +

And politicians spoke of a crisis of male virility 男性阳刚之气危机, much of it caused by "new women." In short 简而言之, there's nothing innovative about harkening back to 回想起；追忆 an age of "traditional values 传统价值观" that never actually existed. +

It was true that women had been making demands for change through the nineteenth century. They wanted legal ownership 合法所有权 of their wages 工资 and other property and access to higher education 高等教育. (Increasingly, young women could enter universities and even rank higher than men in exams, but places like Oxford 牛津大学 and Cambridge 剑桥大学 would not grant them degrees 学位. Cambridge did not until after World War II). +

Women also wanted the right to divorce 离婚权 and to have custody of their children 孩子的抚养权 after divorce (by law, custody of children went to the father, because children were considered his "property" 财产). +

By the early twentieth century, feminist movements 女权运动 had developed across the globe and included an extremely diverse group of activists 活动家. In Europe, some organizations had begun with interest in the abolition of slavery 废除奴隶制, while others had greater concern for the situation of women working in factories or other low-wage conditions 低工资环境, including their health, access to good jobs, and personal safety 人身安全. +

Many pro-women advocates 支持女性的倡导者 were also in favor of temperance 禁酒, given the prevalence of domestic abuse 家庭暴力 that so often accompanied drunkenness 酗酒. +

Other groups lobbied 游说 to end the laws denying prostitutes 妓女 their civil rights 公民权利: in many countries from Britain and France to Austria-Hungary 奥匈帝国, police could and did arrest and incarcerate 监禁 women found on the street and then subject them to gynecological examinations 妇科检查 on the grounds that 以…为理由；根据 they might be prostitutes. +

Austrian activist Marianne Hainisch 玛丽安·海尼施 defined feminism 女权主义 broadly 宽泛地, as "the call of one half of humanity for its civil rights," but others saw feminism's goal as uplifting humanity as a whole 提升全人类. Because it was a diverse movement without one single narrative 单一叙事. +

So, feminists 女权主义者 -- literally hundreds of thousands of them by the end of the nineteenth century -- were seeking to address a broad range of issues 一系列广泛的问题 -- which makes sense, of course, because women, depending on class and race and experience and profession, were oppressed 压迫 in a broad range of ways. +

Some view the feminist movement as an entirely middle-class project 中产阶级项目 that was unconcerned with 不关心；与…无关 working women. But in fact 但事实上, working women such as those from the textile mills 纺织厂 in northern England also campaigned 发起运动；开展活动 as feminists; other working women wanted unions 工会 to be more active in supporting women, while others wanted the Social Democratic parties 社会民主党 to do more for them. +

But although women did operate within labor movements 劳工运动, union men were generally opposed to 反对 women having jobs in industry because their presence would drag down wages 拉低工资. +

Social Democratic parties at the time usually took the Marxist position 马克思主义立场 that middle-class feminists were the enemy of working women, and that the eventual overthrow 推翻 of the industrial owners by working-class people would lead to the liberation of women alongside the liberation of everyone else. +

Marxists argued that the private property 私有财产 upon which capitalism 资本主义 was based necessarily led to the oppression and regulation of women, so once capitalism had been destroyed, freedom would naturally follow. +

Gradually, feminist activists did begin to achieve gains under laws throughout much of Europe, but one aspect of citizenship 公民身份 eluded 逃避；躲避；使…得不到 them: The right to vote 选举权. +

In England, philosopher John Stuart Mill 约翰·斯图尔特·密尔, a classical liberal 古典自由主义者 interested in principles of personal freedom 个人自由原则, spoke in Parliament 议会 on behalf of women's suffrage 妇女选举权 as early as 1866, but that initiative 倡议；行动 went nowhere, and across Europe, other efforts to gain the vote were thwarted 挫败；阻挠 as well. +

Mill went on to publish *On the Subjection of Women* 《妇女的屈从地位》 in 1869, which drew on 借鉴；利用 the ideas of his wife Harriet Taylor Mill 哈丽特·泰勒·密尔 and became one of the most translated books of its day. But again, the actual vote for women was very slow in coming. +

In 1897, New Zealand granted women's suffrage 给予妇女选举权. In 1902, Australia did, and in 1906, Finland 芬兰 became the first European country where women could vote. Norway 挪威 followed in 1913. +

And I know it's easy to forget just how recently that was, but for context 就背景而言, both of my grandmothers were born before women who didn't own property could vote in Great Britain 英国. +

In Britain, a group of women led by Emmeline Pankhurst 埃米琳·潘克赫斯特 and her daughters Sylvia 西尔维娅 and Cristabel 克里斯塔贝尔 decided to take forceful action 采取强硬行动. In 1903, they founded the Women's Social and Political Union 妇女社会政治联盟. It sponsored mass mobilization 大规模动员 in which thousands of women paraded through the streets 上街游行. +

The reaction was brutal 残酷的；野蛮的 as men attacked the marchers 游行者, grabbing and twisting their breasts 抓捏她们的胸部 and generally assaulting 攻击 them. +

Other feminists' non-violent protests 非暴力抗议 included chaining themselves to the gates of Parliament 把自己锁在议会大门上 and refusing to eat when imprisoned for their actions. Authorities used the brutal tactic 残忍手段 of force-feeding 强制喂食 those on hunger strikes 绝食抗议者. +

Alongside non-violent activities, feminists also blew up mailboxes 炸毁邮箱, slashed works of art 划破艺术品 in galleries and museums, and broke store windows with hammers 用锤子砸碎商店橱窗 -- all of this because for men "it's only property they love." +

In 1913, militant suffragist 激进的选举权争取者 Emily Wilding Davison 埃米莉·怀尔丁·戴维森 cast herself in front of the king's horse at a horse race 赛马比赛 and was killed. +

And so a lot of what we think of as contemporary protest tactics 当代抗议策略 have their roots in 源于 feminist movements. +

Misogynists 厌女者 struck back 反击 against these protests. In Austria 奥地利, men declared that feminists had been corrupted by "crude dark men of the lower races 低等种族的粗鲁黑人" -- combining racism 种族主义 with misogyny 厌女症, which has long been a tactic 策略；手段 of dehumanization 非人化. +

Feminists were also portrayed as 被描绘成 oversexed 性欲过盛的 and unable to appreciate the "refined sexuality 高雅的性观念" of the "heroic [white] races 英勇的（白人）种族". +

These people argued that for gender order 性别秩序 and thus political stability 政治稳定 to be maintained, a man needed a woman "who looks up to his intellectual superiority 智力优势" and "wishes to do nothing but subordinate herself 服从；屈从". +

Women's hands, the prime minister of Italy 意大利总理 said in the 1890s, were not meant for voting but for kissing. +

So OK, let's go back to that question we asked at the beginning. How do we characterize 描述；刻画 the term "modern life 现代生活"? +

Some maintain that technology is the key ingredient 关键要素, while others say there have been technological advances 技术进步 across the millennia 千年. Some point to urbanization 城市化, or changes in the role of women, or the control over reproduction 生育控制 that appeared across Europe by 1900. +

I revealed my own bias 偏见 in this episode by talking about the modern practice of public funding for education 公共教育资助的现代实践. +

Still others note that the idea of "modern" has been used across the centuries: the Roman historian Tacitus 塔西佗, born in the first century BCE 公元前, was happy to have lived "in modern times 现代". +

And so perhaps "modern" is just a term to positively compare one's own times to other places and periods in history. In that sense 从这个意义上说, to call one's society "modern" was mostly propaganda 宣传. +

All of that leaves me wondering what makes our contemporary world 当代世界 feel modern, and to what extent that modernity is a judgement on ourselves and others. +

What does modern mean to you? And who is included in that definition of modern, and who is excluded by it? +

Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time. +

大家好，我是约翰·格林（John Green），这里是《欧洲历史速成课》。 +

我们已经走过了漫长的道路：有轨电车、城市大道的煤气照明、拥挤的铁路枢纽、宽敞的户外咖啡馆，还有穿着节日盛装的工人们在公园中漫步，沿着崭新的宽阔林荫大道闲逛——所有这一切都标志着现代生活在欧洲城市的到来。 +

这些城市不断扩张，是因为大量人口从农村地区向诸如柏林（Berlin）这样的首都城市进行国内迁移，到19世纪末，柏林的人口增长到了四百多万。 +

今天，我们要探讨向现代生活的跨越，以及“现代生活”究竟意味着什么——正如我们在历史研究中多次看到的那样，它的含义取决于视角，无论是对于生活在19世纪欧洲的人们，还是对于今天回望那段历史的我们来说都是如此。 +

[简介] +

1885年，德国工程师卡尔·本茨（Karl Benz）发明了内燃机；六年后，法国制造商阿尔芒·标致（Armand Peugeot）生产出了一辆可用的汽车，为城市的日常生活带来了更快的速度。 +

最初，医生和他们那些来自偏远地区的病人是这些新车的最大受益者，而自行车则给予普通人一种新获得的自由感和冒险精神，同时也让他们有机会摔断手腕。 +

除了交通和照明等领域的变革之外，大约在1900年，还发生了一场化学革命，这场革命带来了合成药物。 +

比如，德国制药公司拜耳（Bayer）生产出了第一种阿司匹林（aspirin）来帮助缓解疼痛。地球仪刚刚打开了吗？ +

地球仪 +

这瓶拜耳阿司匹林上就写着，#非赞助，“神奇药物”。而且它真的很神奇！ +

所以，在阿司匹林出现之前，疼痛主要是用像吗啡（morphine）和可待因（codeine）这样的阿片类药物来治疗。但阿司匹林在许多重要方面与阿片类药物不同。一方面，它不会让人上瘾，而且它还能退烧和减轻炎症。 +

但阿司匹林最令人惊叹的地方在于，尽管它是最早的合成药物之一，却至今仍然非常有用。即使在120年后的今天，它依然是一种有效的止痛药。 +

好的，让我们把注意力转向20世纪初欧洲的大趋势。 +

所以，在整个欧洲，尽管有我们上次谈到的向遥远大陆的移民，人口数量仍在继续增长，但人口的增加并不是因为人们生育了更多的孩子。事实上，情况恰恰相反。 +

1880年至1930年间，欧洲经历了一场“生育控制革命”。除了极少数地区例外，在这五十年的时间里，生育率下降了大约百分之五十，这是因为以下几个事件使得生育控制知识得到了普及：对女性排卵周期有了更好的了解、用于避孕套的橡胶硫化技术的出现，以及宫颈帽或子宫隔膜的发明。 +

但是人口增长是由于儿童死亡率的降低和寿命的延长。像巴氏杀菌法（pasteurization）这样的突破以及对细菌有了更深入的了解，只是有助于延长寿命的两项科学发现。 +

同时，卫生条件也得到了改善，比如污水系统的改进，这使得人们死于像霍乱（cholera）这样的疾病的可能性降低，而在18世纪和19世纪早期，霍乱曾反复肆虐欧洲城市。 +

但即便如此，生育率的下降还是给了政客们一个可以用来拉选票的议题：他们声称，女性正在进行生育罢工，这将导致国家实力的下降。 +

的确，女性的生活正在发生变化，“现代女性”开始在家庭的局限之外开创自己的道路。职业女性早已在低薪的情况下长时间劳作，但现在，那些被认为太过脆弱、对世界一无所知而无法工作的中产阶级女性，也开始找工作了。 +

随着工业、通信、市场营销以及所需技能变得越来越复杂，女性开始在新兴的服务行业工作。她们成为了秘书、售货员、电话和电报接线员、教师和护士。由于公立学校体系的普及，教授识字和基础数学，她们拥有了从事这些工作所必需的技能。 +

如果你想找出为什么今天的生活比50年、200年、500年或800年前更好的一个单一原因……那就是公立学校！ +

但是，尽管在教育和就业方面取得了进步，女性受雇于服务行业，是因为她们被认为能力不如男性，所以可以被支付较少的工资。 +

让我们进入“思考泡泡”环节。 +

1. 显然，女性能力低下和技能不足的这种名声是错误的。 +
2. 例如，女性进入大学学习科学和数学专业——部分原因是这些专业对她们开放， +
3. 因为在当时，这些专业的声望和收益比由男性主导的基于拉丁语和希腊语的人文学科要低。 +
4. 出生于波兰的玛丽·斯克洛多夫斯卡·居里（Marie Sklodowska-Curie）就是这些从事科学工作的新女性之一， +
5. 尽管法国科学院（French Academy of Science）拒绝授予她院士资格， +
6. 即使在她获得了两项诺贝尔奖之后—— +
7. 一项是物理学奖，另一项是化学奖，这使她成为第一个在不同领域获得诺贝尔奖的人。 +
8. 人们普遍认为，因为她是女性，所以她的丈夫皮埃尔（Pierre）一定是替她完成了那些工作。 +
9. 但需要说明的是，玛丽获得第二个诺贝尔奖时，皮埃尔·居里已经去世五年了。 +
10. 她创造了“放射性（radioactivity）”这个术语，并发现了 +
11. 两种新的化学元素，钋（Polonium）和镭（Radium）。 +
12. 她还协助开创了癌症的放射治疗方法， +
13. 最后由于在研究过程中受到了大量的辐射而去世。 +
14. 像居里这样所谓的“现代”女性挑战了人们对女性无能和职业低人一等的既定观念， +
15. 尽管这种错误观念依然盛行； +
16. 事实上，它在今天仍然具有强大的影响力， +
17. 在美国的影响力比在大多数其他富裕国家更大， +
18. 这是根据联合国（UN）和经济合作与发展组织（OECD）的统计数据衡量得出的结论。 +

感谢“思考泡泡”环节。 +

因此，随着现代女性的崛起，性观念也发生了变化。这引发了巨大的丑闻，并催生了一种新的政治工具，通过这种工具，政客们通过斥责大多数男性选民关于罪恶以及这个时代据称正在下降的道德水平等问题来寻求支持，而女性的崛起就是一个例证。 +

男性选民数量的增加是现代生活的另一个标志，这表明了所谓大众社会的发展，大众社会扩大了拥有权力的人数，并且在一定程度上削弱了精英阶层的权力。 +

像更便宜的新闻用纸这样的发明也促进了大众社会的发展，因为更多的人能够获取更多的信息。但就像当时和现在一样，可用信息的数量在增加，但信息的质量并不总是如此。 +

同样，就像当时和现在一样，性丑闻是大新闻。真实的和编造的故事都比比皆是。例如，著名作家奥斯卡·王尔德（Oscar Wilde）就因为与一名年轻男子的关系而被监禁，并遭到广泛的谴责。 +

与此同时，在德国皇帝（German Kaiser）的随行人员中，高级将领和其他贵族被发现经常穿着异性服装，并参与同性之间的关系。媒体对这个丑闻大肆渲染，以至于王室公关人员不得不向德国公众保证，皇帝本人拥有健康的家庭生活——这在当时是异性恋的暗语。 +

1902年，著名军火制造商的老板弗里德里希·阿尔弗雷德·克虏伯（Friedrich Alfred Krupp）在媒体曝光了他与年轻意大利男子的关系后自杀了。 +

政客们谈到了男性阳刚之气的危机，其中很大一部分是由“新女性”造成的。简而言之，回顾一个从未真正存在过的“传统价值观”时代，并没有什么创新之处。 +

的确，在整个19世纪，女性一直在提出变革的要求。她们希望对自己的工资和其他财产拥有合法的所有权，并希望获得接受高等教育的机会。（越来越多的年轻女性能够进入大学，甚至在考试中成绩超过男性，但像牛津大学（Oxford）和剑桥大学（Cambridge）这样的地方却不会授予她们学位。剑桥大学直到第二次世界大战之后才授予女性学位。） +

女性还希望拥有离婚的权利，以及离婚后对孩子的抚养权（根据法律，孩子的抚养权归父亲，因为孩子被认为是他的“财产”）。 +

到20世纪初，女权运动已经在全球范围内发展起来，参与者包括各种各样的活动家。在欧洲，一些组织最初是出于对废除奴隶制的关注而成立的，而另一些组织则更关心在工厂或其他低薪环境中工作的女性的处境，包括她们的健康、获得好工作的机会以及个人安全。 +

许多支持女性的倡导者也支持禁酒，因为家庭暴力在酗酒的情况下常常发生。 +

其他团体则游说要求废除剥夺妓女公民权利的法律：在从英国、法国到奥匈帝国（Austria-Hungary）的许多国家，警察可以而且确实逮捕并监禁了在街上被发现的女性，然后以她们可能是妓女为由对她们进行妇科检查。 +

奥地利活动家玛丽安·海尼施（Marianne Hainisch）将女权主义宽泛地定义为“人类一半对其公民权利的诉求”，但其他人则认为女权主义的目标是提升全人类。因为这是一场多元化的运动，没有单一的叙事。 +

所以，女权主义者——到19世纪末确实有数十万人——试图解决一系列广泛的问题——这当然是有道理的，因为根据阶级、种族、经历和职业的不同，女性在很多方面都受到了压迫。 +

有些人认为女权运动完全是一个中产阶级项目，对职业女性毫不关心。但事实上，像英格兰北部纺织厂的女工们也以女权主义者的身份开展活动；其他职业女性希望工会更积极地支持女性，而另一些人则希望社会民主党（Social Democratic parties）为她们做更多的事情。 +

但是，尽管女性确实参与了劳工运动，工会中的男性通常反对女性在工业领域工作，因为她们的存在会拉低工资水平。 +

当时的社会民主党通常采取马克思主义的立场，即中产阶级女权主义者是职业女性的敌人，并且工人阶级最终推翻工业所有者将使女性和其他所有人一起获得解放。 +

马克思主义者认为，资本主义所基于的私有财产必然导致对女性的压迫和管制，所以一旦资本主义被摧毁，自由自然就会随之而来。 +

渐渐地，女权活动家确实开始在欧洲大部分地区的法律框架下取得成果，但有一个公民身份的方面却一直未能实现：选举权。 +

在英国，对个人自由原则感兴趣的古典自由主义哲学家约翰·斯图尔特·密尔（John Stuart Mill）早在1866年就在议会中为女性选举权发声，但那项倡议毫无结果，并且在整个欧洲，其他争取选举权的努力也都遭到了挫败。 +

密尔在1869年继续出版了《妇女的屈从地位》（*On the Subjection of Women*），这本书借鉴了他妻子哈丽特·泰勒·密尔（Harriet Taylor Mill）的思想，并成为当时被翻译次数最多的书籍之一。但同样，女性真正获得选举权的过程非常缓慢。 +

1897年，新西兰（New Zealand）赋予了女性选举权。1902年，澳大利亚（Australia）也赋予了女性选举权，1906年，芬兰（Finland）成为第一个女性可以投票的欧洲国家。挪威（Norway）在1913年也紧随其后。 +

我知道很容易忘记这其实是不久之前的事，但作为背景信息，我的祖母辈们都是在英国没有财产的女性获得选举权之前出生的。 +

在英国，由埃米琳·潘克赫斯特（Emmeline Pankhurst）和她的女儿西尔维娅（Sylvia）以及克里斯塔贝尔（Cristabel）带领的一群女性决定采取强硬行动。1903年，她们成立了妇女社会政治联盟（Women's Social and Political Union）。该联盟发起了大规模的动员活动，成千上万的女性在街上游行。 +

反应是残酷的，男性攻击游行者，抓住并扭她们的胸部，还对她们进行各种殴打。 +

其他女权主义者的非暴力抗议活动包括将自己锁在议会大门上，以及在因这些行为而被监禁时绝食。当局使用了强制喂食绝食者的残忍手段。 +

除了非暴力活动之外，女权主义者还炸毁邮箱、在画廊和博物馆里划破艺术品，并用锤子砸碎商店的橱窗——所有这一切都是因为对男性来说“他们只爱财产”。 +

1913年，激进的选举权争取者埃米莉·怀尔丁·戴维森（Emily Wilding Davison）在一场赛马比赛中扑向国王的马，结果不幸丧生。 +

所以，我们所认为的许多当代抗议策略都源于女权运动。 +

厌女者对这些抗议进行了反击。在奥地利，男性宣称女权主义者已经被“低等种族的粗鲁黑人”腐蚀了——将种族主义和厌女症结合在一起，这长期以来一直是一种将人非人化的手段。 +

女权主义者还被描绘成性欲过盛，并且无法欣赏“英勇的[白人]种族”的“高雅的性观念”。 +

这些人认为，为了维护性别秩序，进而维护政治稳定，一个男人需要一个“仰望他的智力优势”并且“除了服从他之外什么都不想做”的女人。 +

意大利总理在19世纪90年代说过，女人的手不是用来投票的，而是用来亲吻的。 +

那么好吧，让我们回到我们一开始提出的那个问题。我们如何描述“现代生活”这个词呢？ +

有些人认为技术是关键因素，而另一些人则说在几千年的时间里一直都有技术进步。有些人指出城市化，或者女性角色的变化，或者是1900年在欧洲出现的对生育的控制。 +

在这一集中，我通过谈论公共教育资助的现代实践揭示了我自己的偏见。 +

还有一些人指出，“现代”这个概念在几个世纪以来一直被使用：出生于公元前一世纪的罗马历史学家塔西佗（Tacitus），就很高兴自己生活在“现代”。 +

所以也许“现代”只是一个用来将自己所处的时代与历史上的其他地方和时期进行积极比较的术语。从这个意义上说，称一个社会为“现代”大多是一种宣传手段。 +

所有这一切都让我思考是什么让我们的当代世界感觉是现代的，以及这种现代性在多大程度上是对我们自己和他人的一种评判。 +

对你来说，现代意味着什么呢？在现代的定义中包括了谁，又排除了谁呢？ +

感谢观看。我们下次再见。 +

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

So, we've come a long way: Electric-powered street cars, gas lighting of urban avenues, crowded railway hubs, vast outdoor cafés, and workers in their Sunday best strolling through parks and along broad new boulevards -- all of this signaled the arrival of modern life in European cities.

And those cities swelled because of massive internal migration from rural areas to capitals such as Berlin, which grew to over four million people by the end of the 19th century.

Today we're covering the leap to modern life and what exactly "modern life" meant -- and as we've seen so many times in our study of history, what it meant depends upon perspective, both for those living in 19th century Europe and for those of us today looking back on it.

[Intro]

In 1885, German engineer Karl Benz invented an internal combustion engine; six years later, French manufacturer Armand Peugeot produced a functioning automobile, bringing further speed to everyday life in cities.

Initially, doctors and their far-flung patients were the people who benefited most from these new cars, while bicycles gave ordinary people a new-found sense of freedom and adventure, and also an opportunity to break their wrists.

And alongside revolutions in transportation and lighting and many others, there was also a chemical revolution taking place around 1900, which led to synthetic drugs.

Like, German pharmaceutical company Bayer produced the first aspirin to help alleviate pain. Did the globe just open?

GLOBE

It says right here on this bottle of Bayer aspirin, #NOTSPON, "The Wonder Drug." And it really is!

So, before aspirin, pain was treated primarily with opioids like morphine and codeine. But aspirin differed from opioids in many important ways. For one thing, it wasn't addictive, but also, it reduced fevers and inflammation.

But what's most amazing about aspirin is that even though it was one of the first synthetic drugs, it's still super useful. It is an effective pain reliever even 120 years later.

OK, let's turn our attention to the big trends of early 20th century Europe.

So, across Europe, populations continued to grow despite the emigration to distant continents that we talked about last time, but populations weren't going up because people were having more babies. In fact, the opposite was true.

Europe experienced a "birth control revolution" between 1880 and 1930. With very few regional exceptions, in that fifty-year period, fertility rates dropped some fifty percent because knowledge of birth control expanded thanks to a few occurrences: better understanding of women's ovulatory cycles, the vulcanization of rubber used in condoms, and the invention of the cervical cap or diaphragm.

But population rose due to lower child mortality and increased longevity. Breakthroughs like pasteurization and greater understanding of germs were just two scientific findings that helped extend life.

There was also better sanitation, such as improved sewage systems, which made people less likely to die of diseases like cholera, which had ravaged European cities repeatedly in the 18th and early 19th centuries.

But still, this decline in fertility gave politicians an issue that they could use to get votes: women, they claimed, were conducting a birth strike which would lead to the decline in national strength.

It was true that women's lives were changing, as a "modern woman" began forging her own way outside the confines of the household. Working women had already been laboring long hours for low wages, but now middle-class women, supposedly too fragile and ignorant of the world to work, began to take jobs.

As industry, communications, marketing, and needed skills became more complex, women took jobs in the new service sector. They became secretaries, sales clerks, telephone and telegraph operators, teachers, and nurses. And they had the skills necessary to do these jobs thanks to the spreading system of public schools, which taught literacy and basic mathematics.

If you wanna look for a single cause of why life is better today than it was 50 or 200 or 500 or 800 years ago... Public schools!

But despite gains in education and employment, women were employed in the service sector because they could be paid less since they were seen as inferior and not as skilled as men.

Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

1. Obviously, the reputation women had for being inferior and less skilled was false.
2. For instance, women entered universities in the sciences and math -- which were open to them in part
3. because at the time they were less prestigious and lucrative than the Latin- and Greek-based humanities dominated by men.
4. Polish-born Marie Sklodowska-Curie was one of these new, scientific women,
5. although the French Academy of Science would not grant her membership,
6. even after she'd won two Nobel Prizes --
7. one for physics and a second in chemistry, making her the first person to win the prize in different fields.
8. It was widely believed that because she was a woman, her husband Pierre must have done the work for her.
9. But for the record, Pierre Curie had been dead for five years when Marie won her second Nobel.
10. She coined the term "radioactivity" and discovered
11. two new chemical elements, Polonium and Radium.
12. She also helped pioneer radiation treatment for cancer
13. before dying due to the high exposure to radiation she experienced through her research.
14. So-called "Modern" women like Curie challenged the established belief in women's incompetence and professional inferiority,
15. although the myth prevailed;
16. in fact, it remains powerful today,
17. moreso in the United States than in most other wealthy countries,
18. as measured by UN and OECD statistics.

Thanks, Thought Bubble.

So, changes in sexuality accompanied the rise of modern women. And this led to massive scandals and the creation of a new political tool, whereby politicians sought support by haranguing the mostly male electorate about sin and the purportedly declining morals of the age, as exemplified by the rise of women.

And the fact that the male electorate was growing was another sign of modern life, indicating the development of so-called mass society, which broadened the number of people who had power and somewhat diluted the power of elites.

Inventions like cheaper newsprint also facilitated mass society, because more people had access to more information. But then as now, the amount of information available was increasing, but not always the quality of that information.

Also, then as now, sex scandals were big news. Both true and fabricated stories abounded. For example, successful author Oscar Wilde was imprisoned and widely condemned because of his relationship with a young man.

In members of the German Kaiser's entourage, meanwhile, high-ranking generals and other aristocrats were found to be regularly cross-dressing and engaging in male-male relationships. The press dramatized that scandal so much that royal publicists had to reassure the German public that the Kaiser himself had a healthy family life -- code at the time for heterosexuality.

In 1902, Friedrich Alfred Krupp, owner of the famed arms manufacturer, committed suicide when the press revealed his relationships with young Italian men.

And politicians spoke of a crisis of male virility, much of it caused by "new women." In short, there's nothing innovative about harkening back to an age of "traditional values" that never actually existed.

It was true that women had been making demands for change through the nineteenth century. They wanted legal ownership of their wages and other property and access to higher education. (Increasingly, young women could enter universities and even rank higher than men in exams, but places like Oxford and Cambridge would not grant them degrees. Cambridge did not until after World War II).

Women also wanted the right to divorce and to have custody of their children after divorce (by law, custody of children went to the father, because children were considered his "property").

By the early twentieth century, feminist movements had developed across the globe and included an extremely diverse group of activists. In Europe, some organizations had begun with interest in the abolition of slavery, while others had greater concern for the situation of women working in factories or other low-wage conditions, including their health, access to good jobs, and personal safety.

Many pro-women advocates were also in favor of temperance, given the prevalence of domestic abuse that so often accompanied drunkenness.

Other groups lobbied to end the laws denying prostitutes their civil rights: in many countries from Britain and France to Austria-Hungary, police could and did arrest and incarcerate women found on the street and then subject them to gynecological examinations on the grounds that they might be prostitutes.

Austrian activist Marianne Hainisch defined feminism broadly, as "the call of one half of humanity for its civil rights," but others saw feminism's goal as uplifting humanity as a whole. Because it was a diverse movement without one single narrative.

So, feminists -- literally hundreds of thousands of them by the end of the nineteenth century -- were seeking to address a broad range of issues -- which makes sense, of course, because women, depending on class and race and experience and profession, were oppressed in a broad range of ways.

Some view the feminist movement as an entirely middle-class project that was unconcerned with working women. But in fact, working women such as those from the textile mills in northern England also campaigned as feminists; other working women wanted unions to be more active in supporting women, while others wanted the Social Democratic parties to do more for them.

But although women did operate within labor movements, union men were generally opposed to women having jobs in industry because their presence would drag down wages.

Social Democratic parties at the time usually took the Marxist position that middle-class feminists were the enemy of working women, and that the eventual overthrow of the industrial owners by working-class people would lead to the liberation of women alongside the liberation of everyone else.

Marxists argued that the private property upon which capitalism was based necessarily led to the oppression and regulation of women, so once capitalism had been destroyed, freedom would naturally follow.

Gradually, feminist activists did begin to achieve gains under laws throughout much of Europe, but one aspect of citizenship eluded them: The right to vote.

In England, philosopher John Stuart Mill, a classical liberal interested in principles of personal freedom, spoke in Parliament on behalf of women's suffrage as early as 1866, but that initiative went nowhere, and across Europe, other efforts to gain the vote were thwarted as well.

Mill went on to publish *On the Subjection of Women* in 1869, which drew on the ideas of his wife Harriet Taylor Mill and became one of the most translated books of its day. But again, the actual vote for women was very slow in coming.

In 1897, New Zealand granted women's suffrage. In 1902, Australia did, and in 1906, Finland became the first European country where women could vote. Norway followed in 1913.

And I know it's easy to forget just how recently that was, but for context, both of my grandmothers were born before women who didn't own property could vote in Great Britain.

In Britain, a group of women led by Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters Sylvia and Cristabel decided to take forceful action. In 1903, they founded the Women's Social and Political Union. It sponsored mass mobilization in which thousands of women paraded through the streets.

The reaction was brutal as men attacked the marchers, grabbing and twisting their breasts and generally assaulting them.

Other feminists' non-violent protests included chaining themselves to the gates of Parliament and refusing to eat when imprisoned for their actions. Authorities used the brutal tactic of force-feeding those on hunger strikes.

Alongside non-violent activities, feminists also blew up mailboxes, slashed works of art in galleries and museums, and broke store windows with hammers -- all of this because for men "it's only property they love."

In 1913, militant suffragist Emily Wilding Davison cast herself in front of the king's horse at a horse race and was killed.

And so a lot of what we think of as contemporary protest tactics have their roots in feminist movements.

Misogynists struck back against these protests. In Austria, men declared that feminists had been corrupted by "crude dark men of the lower races" -- combining racism with misogyny, which has long been a tactic of dehumanization.

Feminists were also portrayed as oversexed and unable to appreciate the "refined sexuality" of the "heroic [white] races."

These people argued that for gender order and thus political stability to be maintained, a man needed a woman "who looks up to his intellectual superiority" and "wishes to do nothing but subordinate herself."

Women's hands, the prime minister of Italy said in the 1890s, were not meant for voting but for kissing.

So OK, let's go back to that question we asked at the beginning. How do we characterize the term "modern life"?

Some maintain that technology is the key ingredient, while others say there have been technological advances across the millennia. Some point to urbanization, or changes in the role of women, or the control over reproduction that appeared across Europe by 1900.

I revealed my own bias in this episode by talking about the modern practice of public funding for education.

Still others note that the idea of "modern" has been used across the centuries: the Roman historian Tacitus, born in the first century BCE, was happy to have lived "in modern times."

And so perhaps "modern" is just a term to positively compare one's own times to other places and periods in history. In that sense, to call one's society "modern" was mostly propaganda.

All of that leaves me wondering what makes our contemporary world feel modern, and to what extent that modernity is a judgement on ourselves and others.

What does modern mean to you? And who is included in that definition of modern, and who is excluded by it?

Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time.
