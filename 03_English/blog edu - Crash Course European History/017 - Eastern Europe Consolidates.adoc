== 释义

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

So we've talked a lot about shifting perspectives 转变视角 in this series; being able to see from more than one angle 角度 helps us to be empathetic 有同理心的, but it also reminds us that there is no single correct way to look at human history.
Zooming in 放大视角 to understand the individual choices of individual historical figures 历史人物 is important, but so is zooming out 缩小视角 to understand larger forces 更大的力量.
And if we can zoom way, way out for a moment, two of the big questions of European history (and world history) are how centralized 集中的 should government power be, and who should decide who wields 行使；掌握 that power?
We've seen attempts to centralize government power over large communities in western Europe, and fights over constitutionalism 立宪主义 or absolutism 专制主义.
But now we're going to turn east, to see how another region of Europe was governing 治理 and growing in the 17th century.

[Intro]
In 1618, Poland-Lithuania 波兰 - 立陶宛 was the largest kingdom fully located in Europe.
It enjoyed a consensus form of government 协商一致的政府形式.
When a monarch 君主 died, a successor king 继任国王 was elected.
Representatives from dozens of smaller political units 政治单位 across the kingdom were summoned 召集 to meet and determine who would be king.
Consensus 共识 was reached through negotiations 谈判 among uppercrust aristocrats 上层贵族 and candidates for king 王位候选人.
The Commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania 波兰 - 立陶宛联邦 formally came into being 正式形成 in 1569, but in reality it had been established with the fourteenth century marriage of a Polish queen to a Lithuanian Grand Duke 立陶宛大公.
During the religious turmoil 宗教动荡 of the sixteenth century, Poland remained Catholic 天主教的.
Also, and unusually, the consensus-style government gave freedom to individual princes 王子；贵族 who wanted to follow Luther, Calvin, or any of the other gajillion religious reformers 宗教改革者.
Now of course freedom for princes isn't freedom for peasants 农民, but still...
Candidates for king even had to commit themselves to religious pluralism 宗教多元主义.
That toleration 宽容 drew Jewish people from Spanish and other intolerant regimes 不宽容的政权 eastward into the kingdom.
It was a very diverse place -- both in terms of religion and ethnicity 种族.
The creation of Poland-Lithuania also meant that present-day Ukraine 乌克兰 was now part of Poland's holdings 领地.
The Commonwealth's ambitions 野心 sent its people and its government southward into Ukraine where there were fertile lands 肥沃的土地 available for settlement 定居 -- not the last time that Ukraine's abundant farmland 丰富的农田 would make it a center of expansionist attention 扩张主义关注的焦点.
And the Polish nobility 贵族 followed as the kings awarded them vast Ukrainian estates 大片乌克兰地产, which their new owners ruled with an iron hand 严厉地 -- alienating 疏远 both former inhabitants 居民 and new migrants 移民.
So, at this point, Eastern Europe as a whole was complicated and competitive, as all theses kingdoms struggled to acquire more territory 领土 for farmland and better access to resources 资源.
To Poland-Lithuania's north, Sweden had a united Lutheran 路德宗的 population and an excellent fighting force 战斗力；军队; it too wanted to expand into the continent's Baltic territories 波罗的海地区.
The Ottoman empire 奥斯曼帝国, which was more powerful and controlled most of Hungary by the middle of the seventeenth century, was primarily Muslim 穆斯林的.
But because of its more westerly and northerly conquests 征服, it had large pockets of Orthodox Christians 东正教徒.
And hundreds of thousands of Ottoman families had moved to the Balkans 巴尔干半岛 and other Ottoman possessions 属地 in southeastern Europe.
And many Jews had migrated to the Ottoman Empire because of Habsburg persecution 哈布斯堡王朝的迫害.
In fact, compared to most other European rulers, Muslims were tolerant 宽容的: they did not persecute religious minorities 宗教少数派 by seeking them out and burning them at the stake 火刑 in great numbers as Christians did.
Instead, they were taxed at a higher rate than Muslims were.
Which...you know, compared to being burned alive...I would take.
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

The Ottoman Empire had developed politically through the efforts of some spectacularly successful leaders.
One was Mehmet I who in 1453 took Constantinople 君士坦丁堡 from the Byzantine Empire 拜占庭帝国.
Then there was Selim I who conquered Egypt in 1517,
followed by Suleyman the Magnificent 苏莱曼大帝's series of triumphs 胜利 across the Middle East
and further expansion into southwestern Europe, North Africa, and the Mediterranean 地中海.
The Ottomans had a far from constitutional process for succession 继承.
The sultan 苏丹 often had many concubines 妻妾 who lived together in the harem 后宫,
which was not, as is often depicted, a kind of brothel 妓院,
but instead the seat of government 政府所在地.
It was a place for state business 国家事务, policy decision-making 政策决策, and other important matters.
But after any one of the sultan's partners gave birth to a son,
she and her son usually moved to the provinces 行省,
where the boy learned rulership skills 统治技能 while also developing a network of followers 追随者网络.
And then when the sultan died, the oldest son usually succeeded him,
but not always.
Factions 派系, often developed by an aspiring son's mother, struggled for a place in the empire.
Unsurprisingly, murder 谋杀 was often involved.
A new sultan's brothers were usually murdered on his accession to the throne 登基 so they couldn't plot coups 政变.
All in all, they could have used some good family therapy 家庭治疗.
But on the other hand, you know, kingmaking 拥立国王 is kind of an inherently dirty business 本质上不光彩的事情.
Thanks Thought Bubble.

Despite that not-very-secure-sounding system, the absolutist Ottoman state 专制的奥斯曼帝国 was among the longest lived empires in history, lasting until 1922, at which point Constantinople became Istanbul, clearing the way for They Might Be Giants to record their third best song.
In any conquered region, the Ottoman government drafted 征召 young Christian boys into its army and bureaucracy 官僚机构, educating them, and converting them to Islam 伊斯兰教.
Taken from their parents, they became part of the janissary corps 禁卫军, in which they could and did rise to the highest reaches of government 政府最高层 alongside advisors and bureaucrats from influential families 有影响力的家族.
The rulers and nobility also developed a different household type 家庭类型, including multiple wives 妻妾 and large numbers of offspring 子女.
Given Ottoman men's service as ghazis 圣战者, or warriors 战士, and given the immense slaughter 屠杀 across the entire European population at the time, having many wives seemed like the prudent 谨慎的 thing to do because there just weren't that many men.
Women in these households were often wealthy and empowered to purchase warehouses 仓库 and manufacturing establishments 制造企业, whereas women to the west often did not have inheritance 继承权 or property rights 财产权.
And when men were off fighting, women served as unofficial replacements 非正式替代者 in the Ottoman Empire -- Hurrem, the sole wife of Suleyman being a prime example 典型例子.
And in communities where many girls and women were left in seclusion 隐居, other women had opportunities to serve as their lawyers, accountants 会计, and scribes 抄写员, and doctors, and teachers, and other professionals 专业人员.
So the Ottomans had developed different social structures 社会结构 and state structures 国家结构.
I know it's tempting to view all of this through a modern lens 现代视角, and think about this is good, this is bad, this is modern, and this is not modern.
I don't think that's the right lens through which to view all of this.
We're talking about the 17th Century, so we should compare it to the rest of the 17th Century.
And in many ways, the 17th Century Ottoman Empire had big advantages over other European communities, but after their failure to capture Vienna 维也纳 in 1683, which we'll get to in a minute, the Empire's competitive edge 竞争优势 did dull 减弱.
Nearby, Russia was also expanding thanks to Ivan IV, aka 又名 Ivan the Terrible 伊凡雷帝, who did have vicious outbursts of temper 脾气暴躁的发作 and, also, did kill his own son during a quarrel 争吵, which to be fair 公平地说 is kind of terrible.
Ivan's grandfather Ivan III had begun growing the Russian empire as well as creating a modern state structure 现代国家结构, complete with administrative departments 行政部门 and functionaries 官员.
He also oversaw extensive building at the Kremlin complex 克里姆林宫建筑群.
The first part of Ivan IV's rule continued Russia's institutional development 制度发展 with the creation of an improved code of laws 法律法典 and better tax collection 税收.
Ivan also summoned distinguished representatives 杰出代表 of the orthodox church 东正教会 and the nobility along with wealthy townspeople to an assembly (zemskii sobor) 缙绅会议, which continued to meet.
And for these accomplishments 成就, as well as Ivan's expansionist ambitions 扩张野心, many historians have restored the word groznyi -- once interpreted to mean "terrible" -- to the meaning held by Russians of his day: Ivan the "formidable" 令人敬畏的, or "fearsome" 可怕的, or even "awesome" 令人惊叹的.
Meanwhile high churchmen 高级神职人员 were working to make Ivan literally awesome by creating imagery 形象 in churches of a tsar 沙皇 connected to the divine 神圣的.
They also depicted the connection between the tsar and people along a divine continuum 神圣的延续性.
At the time, the head of the Orthodox church claimed that the Russian ruler was, quote, "everywhere under the vault of heaven 苍穹 the one Christian Tsar, mounted on the holy throne of God of the holy apostolic church 圣使徒教会, in place of the Roman and Constantinopolitan [thrones] in the God-saved city of Moscow."
So, not God Himself or anything -- just mounted on the holy throne of God 登上上帝的圣座.
Rather like Louis XIV over in France.
Did the center of the world just open?
Is Jesus in there?
It's a crucifix 十字架.
You might be thinking, "did you just shoehorn in 硬塞进 this center of the world bit?"
Yeah, I did.
And it's not the first time Jesus has been shoehorned in where he doesn't fit well.
If you ever read the accounts of Jesus's life, one thing that you'll note is that, uh, he was never a political leader, nor did he ever choose political leaders, nor did he ever express much interest in choosing political leaders.
But just as every religion has to adapt to the culture in which it finds itself, cultures have to adapt to religions.
It's this endless, very complicated dance 无尽而复杂的互动.
And that's how you end up with one guy mounted on the holy throne of God in Russia, and a different guy mounted on the holy throne of God in France.
But back to Russia.
As it bureaucratized 官僚化 along the lines of 按照；遵循 the western European kingdoms, Russia developed the rituals 仪式 of a top-down autocratic state 自上而下的专制国家, which lasted into the twentieth-century.
Serfs 农奴 -- that is, laborers bound to the land 被束缚在土地上的劳动者 and unfree in their movements 行动不自由 -- groveled 卑躬屈膝 before their lords 领主, who often saw these workers as not even deserving of the word "human" 不配被称为“人”.
However, the nobility also groveled in front of the tsar 沙皇, displaying abject submission 极度顺从 akin to 类似于 what serfs showed their lords.
But it's important to understand that it wasn't as simple as people considering themselves, and others, purely inferior 低等的 or superior 高等的.
Instead, the belief was that everyone had a role to play within the system 体系.
Now, to be clear, within that system, most people had very little freedom or what we would now call "human rights" 人权.
But still, throughout history, people have found ways to express human agency 人的主观能动性 no matter the rigidity 僵化 or oppressiveness 压迫性 of the system in which they are living.
Ivan IV was energetic 精力充沛的, especially in the first half of his reign 统治时期.
He took Russia's borders eastward 向东, capturing among other conquests 征服 the Muslim stronghold 据点 of Kazan 喀山.
Russian settlers 定居者 headed for new farmland right up to the Pacific Ocean 太平洋.
And helping Ivan in this conquest, even as absolutist tendencies 专制倾向 developed in Russia, was another group of ordinary people who were neither serfs nor noble grovellers 卑躬屈膝的贵族 but free individuals 自由人.
Called Cossacks 哥萨克人 (from the word Kazak, meaning free), they survived through plunder 掠夺 and trade and through selling their military services 军事服务 to rulers and nobility who needed their fighting skills 战斗技能.
Until late in the seventeenth century, the Cossacks generally looked down on 看不起 farming.
They led nomadic lives 游牧生活, capturing people to sell or robbing ships on the Caspian Sea 里海.
Located along the Ukrainian, Russian, and Ottoman borderlands 边境地区, they were more democratic 民主的 than the rulers to whom they often sold their services, including the Russian tsars whose defeat of Kazan in 1552 they helped facilitate 促成.
After that, the Cossack Yermak Timofeyevich led Russian advances 推进 deeper into Siberia 西伯利亚 with its lucrative fur trade 利润丰厚的毛皮贸易 and became a Russian hero 英雄.
Ivan IV died in 1584 of a stroke 中风 while playing chess, and his heir Fyodor died in 1598, and after that, claimants to the leaderless Russian throne 俄罗斯王位争夺者 abounded 大量存在.
Poland-Lithuania spotted an opening 发现机会 for establishing a Polish prince as Russian tsar 沙皇.
The sense was that Moscow was so disorganized 混乱的 and the monarchy 君主制 was so weak that it could easily fall.
This resulted in the "Time of Troubles" 动荡时期, which was so named because of the famine 饥荒 of 1601 - 3, as well as Poland-Lithuanian and Swedish attacks on Russia, and the general devastation 破坏 caused by that warfare 战争.
These finally ended with Russia's victory in 1613 and the ascension to the throne 登基 of Michael Romanov 米哈伊尔·罗曼诺夫 -- chosen by an "Assembly of the Land" 地方议会 of nobles and, as the new tsar put it, also chosen by God and the voice of the people.
But mostly by the nobles.
Cossack troops 军队 and units from the nobility drove back the enemy, knocking Poland-Lithuania and Sweden out temporarily from the competition for control of the region 争夺该地区控制权的竞争.
And for their efforts, the new tsar thanked his saviors 救星 by raising taxes, cutting back on privileges 特权, and otherwise behaving as if the tsar himself, not his military, had won the day 获胜.
But don't worry the nobility will get back at 报复 the Romanovs in just 300 short years.
The Cossacks, supported by an increasingly oppressed Ukrainian peasantry 农民, went on to reduce Polish power through war that slaughtered 屠杀 tens of thousands of Jewish estate managers 犹太地产管理者, Protestant minorities 新教少数派, and their supporters living in Ukrainian territory 乌克兰领土.
In 1654, Russia joined what became known as the Russo-Polish war 俄波战争, at the end of which in 1667 the eastern part of Ukraine including Kiev 基辅 became part of the Russian empire, while the western part remained part of Poland-Lithuania.
Fortunately, arguments over Ukrainian land had at last been resolved 解决.
What's that, Stan?
Oh.
Still?
Stan, is he behind me?
Because we had a deal that he wasn't going to come out this whole series...GAH...putin.
Right.
Meanwhile, the Polish kingdom, while on a downward path 走下坡路 because of these defeats, would live to fight a fair few more battles 继续打几场仗.
The most famous and consequential 重要的 of these battles for the continent was the battle for Vienna in 1683 when elected Polish king Jan Sobieski 扬·索别斯基 joined forces with 与…联合 the Habsburg monarchy 哈布斯堡王朝 to drive out 驱逐 the invading Ottoman forces 入侵的奥斯曼军队.
We previewed this earlier because it's a big deal 大事.
This led to Habsburg rule being solidified 巩固 around Austria, and Hungary, and other east-central European territories 中欧东部地区.
And it also meant that Europe was gaining some of the political contours 政治轮廓 that would shape its modern history 塑造其现代历史.
I mean, there wasn't yet a Germany as such 这样的德国, or even an Austrohungarian Empire 奥匈帝国, but the scene was being set 局面正在形成.
I know we covered A LOT of power and territory struggles 权力和领土争夺 today.
There was a lot of war in Europe in the 17th Century.
But if we zoom out, we see generations-long disagreements 长期分歧 over how centralized communities should be, and where the right to rule 统治权 comes from.
These changes were happening in the long run 从长远来看, which is important, but of course no human life is lived in the long run, including yours.
Each of us -- whether a Jewish person escaping religious persecution 宗教迫害 or a woman becoming a lawyer during a time of war -- is profoundly shaped by the short run 短期 we happen to inhabit 生活.
Thanks for watching.

I'll see you next time.

大家好，我是约翰·格林，这里是《速成欧洲史》。

*在这个系列中，我们多次谈到转换视角(换位思考)；能够从多个角度看问题有助于我们富有同理心，但这也提醒我们，看待人类历史并没有单一正确的方式*。
*聚焦于理解单个历史人物的个人选择, 固然重要，但从宏观角度去理解更强大的力量, 也同样重要。*
如果我们能暂时从非常宏观的角度来看，*欧洲历史（以及世界历史）的##两个重大问题是：政府权力应该集中到什么程度，以及谁来决定谁掌握这种权力？(历史的核心就是政治)##*

我们已经看到**西欧在大型社群中, 尝试集中政府权力的努力，以及围绕"立宪主义"和"专制主义"的斗争。**
但现在我们将把目光转向东方，看看17世纪欧洲的另一个地区, 是如何进行治理和发展的。

[开场介绍]
1618年，*波兰立陶宛联邦*（Poland-Lithuania）, 是完全位于欧洲境内的最大王国。
它实行的是一种达成共识的政府形式。
当一位君主去世后，会选举出一位继任国王。
*来自王国境内数十个较小政治单位的代表, 会被召集起来开会，以决定谁将成为国王。*
*共识是通过上层贵族和王位候选人之间的谈判达成的。*

波兰立陶宛联邦, 于1569年正式成立，但实际上，14世纪时一位波兰女王与一位立陶宛大公的联姻, 就奠定了它的基础。
在16世纪的宗教动荡时期，波兰仍然是天主教国家。
而且，不同寻常的是，这种共识式的政府, 给予了那些想要追随马丁·路德（Luther）、约翰·加尔文（Calvin）或其他众多宗教改革者的个别王公 自由。
**当然，王公的自由, 并不意味着农民的自由，**但即便如此……
王位候选人甚至必须承诺支持宗教多元化。
*这种宽容, 吸引了来自西班牙和其他不宽容政权的犹太人, 向东迁移到这个王国。*
这是一个在宗教和种族方面, 都非常多样化的地方。

波兰立陶宛联邦的建立, 也意味着当今的乌克兰（Ukraine）成为了波兰领土的一部分。
联邦的野心, 促使其人民和政府向南进入乌克兰，那里有肥沃的土地可供定居——这不是乌克兰丰富的农田第一次使其成为扩张主义关注的中心。
波兰贵族也随之而来，因为国王们授予他们大片乌克兰土地，这些新的土地所有者, 以铁腕手段进行统治——这疏远了原住民和新移民。
所以，在这个时候，整个东欧情况复杂且竞争激烈，因为所有这些王国, 都在努力获取更多的农田领土, 以及更好地获取资源。

*在波兰立陶宛联邦的北部，瑞典（Sweden）拥有统一的路德教派人口, 和一支优秀的战斗力量；它也想扩张到欧洲大陆的波罗的海地区。*

奥斯曼帝国（Ottoman empire）更为强大，到17世纪中叶控制了匈牙利（Hungary）的大部分地区，它主要是一个穆斯林国家。
但由于它在更西部和北部的征服行动，帝国内有大量的东正教基督徒群体。
数十万奥斯曼家庭迁移到了巴尔干半岛（Balkans）和欧洲东南部的其他奥斯曼属地。
而且**许多犹太人因为哈布斯堡王朝（Habsburg）的迫害, 而迁移到了奥斯曼帝国。**
*事实上，与大多数其他欧洲统治者相比，穆斯林是宽容的：他们不会像基督徒那样，主动搜捕宗教少数群体, 并大量将他们绑在火刑柱上烧死来迫害他们。*
*相反，他们对这些宗教少数群体, 征收比穆斯林更高的税。*
这……你知道的，与被活活烧死相比……我会选择交税。

让我们进入“思想泡泡”环节。

奥斯曼帝国在一些极为成功的领导人的努力下, 实现了政治发展。
其中一位是穆罕默德一世（Mehmet I），他在1453年从拜占庭帝国（Byzantine Empire）手中夺取了君士坦丁堡（Constantinople）。
然后是塞利姆一世（Selim I），他在1517年征服了埃及（Egypt），
接着是苏莱曼大帝（Suleyman the Magnificent）在中东地区取得了一系列胜利，
并进一步扩张到欧洲西南部、北非（North Africa）和地中海（Mediterranean）地区。

*奥斯曼帝国的王位继承过程, 远非遵循宪法规定。*
苏丹（sultan）通常有许多妾室，她们一起生活在后宫（harem）里，
**后宫**并不像通常所描绘的那样是一种妓院，
而**是政府的所在地。
这是处理国家事务、制定政策决策和其他重要事务的地方。**

但在**苏丹的任何一位妾室生下儿子后，
她和她的儿子通常会搬到行省，
在那里，男孩学习统治技能，同时也建立起自己的追随者网络。
然后当苏丹去世时，通常是长子继承王位，
但也并不总是如此。**
*有抱负的王子的母亲常常会形成不同的派系，为在帝国中谋取一席之地而争斗。
毫不奇怪，谋杀常常在其中发生。
新苏丹即位时，他的兄弟们通常会被谋杀，这样他们就无法策划政变了。*
总而言之，他们本可以进行一些良好的家庭心理治疗。
但另一方面，你知道的，拥立国王, 在某种程度上本来就是一件不光彩的事情。

感谢“思想泡泡”！

**尽管继承制度听起来不太可靠，但专制的奥斯曼帝国, 却是历史上延续时间最长的帝国之一，一直持续到1922年，**在那之后君士坦丁堡改名为伊斯坦布尔（Istanbul），这为They Might Be Giants乐队录制他们第三好听的歌曲铺平了道路。

在任何被征服的地区，奥斯曼政府会征召年轻的基督教男孩加入军队和官僚机构，对他们进行教育，并使他们皈依伊斯兰教。
这些男孩被从父母身边带走，成为禁卫军（janissary corps）的一员，在那里他们能够, 并且确实与来自有影响力家庭的顾问和官僚一起, 晋升到政府的最高职位。

统治者和贵族们也形成了一种不同的家庭模式，包括拥有多个妻子和大量的后代。
*考虑到奥斯曼男性作为ghazi（意为勇士）的职责，以及当时整个欧洲人口都遭受了巨大的屠杀，拥有多个妻子似乎是谨慎之举，因为男性数量实在不多。*
*这些家庭中的女性往往很富有，并且有权购买仓库和制造企业，而西方的女性通常没有继承权或财产权。*
*当男性外出打仗时，女性在奥斯曼帝国中充当非官方的替代者*——苏莱曼唯一的妻子许蕾姆（Hurrem）就是一个典型的例子。
*在许多女孩和女性被迫隐居的社区里，其他女性有机会担任她们的律师、会计、抄写员、医生、教师和其他专业人员。*

所以奥斯曼帝国发展出了不同的社会结构和国家结构。
**#我知道很容易用现代的视角来看待这一切，然后认为这个好，那个坏，这个现代，那个不现代。
但我认为这不是看待这一切的正确视角。
我们谈论的是17世纪，所以我们应该将其与17世纪的其他情况进行比较。#
在许多方面，17世纪的奥斯曼帝国相比其他欧洲社群有很大的优势，**但在1683年未能攻下维也纳（Vienna）之后——我们马上会讲到——帝国的竞争优势确实减弱了。

在附近，俄罗斯（Russia）也在扩张，这要归功于伊凡四世（Ivan IV），也就是“恐怖的伊凡”（Ivan the Terrible），他确实会突然大发雷霆，而且，他确实在一次争吵中杀死了自己的儿子，公平地说，这确实有点可怕。
伊凡的祖父伊凡三世（Ivan III）, 就已经开始扩张俄罗斯帝国，并且建立了一个现代国家结构，包括行政部门和官员。
他还监督了克里姆林宫（Kremlin）建筑群的大规模建设。

伊凡四世统治的前期, 继续推动了俄罗斯的制度发展，制定了完善的法典, 并改进了税收制度。
伊凡还召集了东正教（orthodox church）的杰出代表、贵族以及富有的市民参, 加议会（zemskii sobor），这个议会后来继续召开会议。
由于这些成就，以及伊凡的扩张野心，许多历史学家重新解读了“groznyi”这个词——这个词曾经被解释为“可怕的”——还原为他那个时代俄罗斯人所理解的含义：伊凡“令人生畏的”，或者“可怕的”，甚至是“令人敬畏的”。

与此同时，*高级神职人员通过在教堂中创造沙皇（tsar）与神灵相关的形象，努力让伊凡真正令人敬畏。*
他们还描绘了沙皇与人民之间沿着神圣的延续性的联系。
*当时，东正教的领袖声称，俄罗斯统治者“在天堂穹顶之下的任何地方, 都是唯一的基督教沙皇，坐在神圣使徒教会的上帝的神圣宝座上，取代了罗马和君士坦丁堡[的宝座]，位于上帝庇佑的城市莫斯科（Moscow）”。*
所以，不是上帝本人之类的——只是坐在上帝的神圣宝座上。
这有点像法国的路易十四（Louis XIV）。

世界的中心是不是又打开了？
耶稣在里面吗？
这是一个十字架。
你可能会想，“你刚刚是不是硬把这个世界中心的情节加进来的？”
是的，我就是加进来的。
而且这不是第一次把耶稣硬塞进不合适的地方了。
*#如果你读过关于耶稣生平的记载，你会注意到的一件事是，呃，他从来不是一个政治领袖，他也从未选择过政治领袖，他也从未对选择政治领袖表现出太多兴趣。#*
但就像每种宗教都必须适应它所处的文化一样，文化也必须适应宗教。
这是一场无尽的、非常复杂的舞蹈。
这就是为什么最终在俄罗斯有一个人坐在上帝的神圣宝座上，而在法国有另一个人坐在上帝的神圣宝座上。

但让我们回到俄罗斯。
随着俄罗斯按照西欧王国的模式进行官僚化，它发展出了自上而下的"专制国家"的仪式，这种情况一直持续到20世纪。
*#农奴——也就是被束缚在土地上、行动不自由的劳动者——在他们的领主面前卑躬屈膝，领主们常常认为这些劳动者甚至不配被称为“人”。然而，贵族们也在沙皇面前卑躬屈膝，表现出与农奴对领主的绝对服从类似的态度。但重要的是要明白，事情并不像人们认为自己和他人纯粹地低人一等, 或高人一等那么简单。相反，人们相信每个人在这个体系中都有自己要扮演的角色。#*
现在，#*需要明确的是，在那个体系中，大多数人几乎没有自由，或者我们现在所说的“人权”。*#
但即便如此，纵观历史，无论人们生活的体系多么僵化或压迫，他们总会找到表达人类能动性的方式。

伊凡四世精力充沛，尤其是在他统治的前期。
他将俄罗斯的边界向东推进，在诸多征服成果中，占领了穆斯林的据点喀山（Kazan）。
俄罗斯的定居者前往新的农田，一直到达太平洋（Pacific Ocean）沿岸。

*在俄罗斯专制倾向发展的同时，帮助伊凡进行征服的还有另一群普通人，他们既不是农奴，也不是向沙皇卑躬屈膝的贵族，而是自由的个体。
他们被称为哥萨克人（Cossacks，来自“Kazak”这个词，意为自由的人），他们通过掠夺、贸易, 以及将自己的军事服务出售给需要他们战斗技能的统治者和贵族来生存。
直到17世纪后期，哥萨克人通常都看不起务农。*
*他们过着游牧生活，抓捕人口进行贩卖，或者在里海（Caspian Sea）上抢劫船只。*
他们位于乌克兰、俄罗斯和奥斯曼帝国的边境地区，比他们常常出售服务的那些统治者更加民主，其中包括俄罗斯沙皇，他们帮助沙皇在1552年击败了喀山。
在那之后，哥萨克人叶尔马克·季莫费耶维奇（Yermak Timofeyevich）带领俄罗斯人深入西伯利亚（Siberia），那里有利润丰厚的毛皮贸易，他也成为了俄罗斯的英雄。

伊凡四世在1584年下棋时中风去世，他的继承人费奥多尔（Fyodor）在1598年去世，在那之后，*觊觎群龙无首的俄罗斯王位的人, 比比皆是。*
波兰立陶宛联邦, 看到了让一位波兰王子成为俄罗斯沙皇的机会。
他们觉得莫斯科（Moscow）如此混乱，君主制如此软弱，很容易被拿下。
这导致了“混乱时期”（Time of Troubles）的出现，之所以这么称呼，是因为1601年至1603年的饥荒，以及波兰立陶宛联邦和瑞典, 对俄罗斯的攻击，还有战争造成的普遍破坏。

这些最终以俄罗斯在1613年的胜利, 以及米哈伊尔·罗曼诺夫（Michael Romanov）登上王位而结束——他是由贵族组成的“全俄缙绅会议”（Assembly of the Land）选出的，而且正如这位新沙皇所说，他也是被上帝和人民的声音选中的。
但主要还是被贵族们选中的。
*哥萨克军队和贵族部队击退了敌人，暂时将波兰立陶宛联邦和瑞典, 排除在对该地区控制权的竞争之外。*
*为了感谢这些救星的努力，新沙皇通过提高税收、削减特权, 以及采取其他行为来表示感谢，就好像是沙皇自己，而不是他的军队，赢得了胜利一样。*
但别担心，贵族们会在短短300年后, 报复罗曼诺夫家族（Romanovs）的。

在日益受压迫的乌克兰农民的支持下，哥萨克人继续通过战争, 削弱波兰的力量，这场战争屠杀了数万名犹太庄园管理者、新教少数群体, 以及生活在乌克兰领土上的他们的支持者。
1654年，俄罗斯加入了后来被称为俄波战争（Russo-Polish war）的战争，1667年战争结束时，包括基辅（Kiev）在内的乌克兰东部, 成为了俄罗斯帝国的一部分，而西部, 仍然是波兰立陶宛联邦的一部分。
幸运的是，关于乌克兰土地的争论终于得到了解决。

那是什么，斯坦？
哦。
还在争吗？
斯坦，他在我后面吗？
因为我们说好了在整个系列中他都不会出现的……啊……普京（putin）。
好吧。

与此同时，波兰王国虽然因为这些失败而走下坡路，但仍会继续进行不少战斗。
对欧洲大陆来说，这些战斗中最著名且影响最大的, 是1683年的维也纳之战（battle for Vienna），当时当选的波兰国王扬·索别斯基（Jan Sobieski）与哈布斯堡王朝（Habsburg monarchy）, 联手击退了入侵的奥斯曼军队。
我们之前提到过这件事，因为这是一件大事。
这使得哈布斯堡王朝在奥地利（Austria）、匈牙利以及其他中欧东部地区的统治得以巩固。
这也意味着欧洲正在形成一些将塑造其现代历史的政治轮廓。
我的意思是，那时还没有像现在这样的德国（Germany），甚至也没有奥匈帝国（Austrohungarian Empire），但舞台正在搭建。

我知道我们今天讲述了很多权力和领土的斗争。

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

So we've talked a lot about shifting perspectives in this series; being able to see from more than one angle helps us to be empathetic, but it also reminds us that there is no single correct way to look at human history.

Zooming in to understand the individual choices of individual historical figures is important, but so is zooming out to understand larger forces.

And if we can zoom way, way out for a moment, two of the big questions of European history (and world history) are how centralized should government power be, and who should decide who wields that power?

We've seen attempts to centralize government power over large communities in western Europe, and fights over constitutionalism or absolutism.

But now we're going to turn east, to see how another region of Europe was governing and growing in the 17th century.

[Intro]
In 1618, Poland-Lithuania was the largest kingdom fully located in Europe.

It enjoyed a consensus form of government.

When a monarch died, a successor king was elected.

Representatives from dozens of smaller political units across the kingdom were summoned to meet and determine who would be king.

Consensus was reached through negotiations among uppercrust aristocrats and candidates for king.

The Commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania formally came into being in 1569, but in reality it had been established with the fourteenth century marriage of a Polish queen to a Lithuanian Grand Duke.

During the religious turmoil of the sixteenth century, Poland remained Catholic.

Also, and unusually, the consensus-style government gave freedom to individual princes who wanted to follow Luther, Calvin, or any of the other gajillion religious reformers.

Now of course freedom for princes isn't freedom for peasants, but still...

Candidates for king even had to commit themselves to religious pluralism.

That toleration drew Jewish people from Spanish and other intolerant regimes eastward into the kingdom.

It was a very diverse place -- both in terms of religion and ethnicity.

The creation of Poland-Lithuania also meant that present-day Ukraine was now part of Poland's holdings.

The Commonwealth's ambitions sent its people and its government southward into Ukraine where there were fertile lands available for settlement -- not the last time that Ukraine's abundant farmland would make it a center of expansionist attention.

And the Polish nobility followed as the kings awarded them vast Ukrainian estates, which their new owners ruled with an iron hand -- alienating both former inhabitants and new migrants.

So, at this point, Eastern Europe as a whole was complicated and competitive, as all theses kingdoms struggled to acquire more territory for farmland and better access to resources.

To Poland-Lithuania's north, Sweden had a united Lutheran population and an excellent fighting force; it too wanted to expand into the continent's Baltic territories.

The Ottoman empire, which was more powerful and controlled most of Hungary by the middle of the seventeenth century, was primarily Muslim.

But because of its more westerly and northerly conquests, it had large pockets of Orthodox Christians.

And hundreds of thousands of Ottoman families had moved to the Balkans and other Ottoman possessions in southeastern Europe.

And many Jews had migrated to the Ottoman Empire because of Habsburg persecution.

In fact, compared to most other European rulers, Muslims were tolerant: they did not persecute religious minorities by seeking them out and burning them at the stake in great numbers as Christians did.

Instead, they were taxed at a higher rate than Muslims were.

Which...you know, compared to being burned alive...I would take.

Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

The Ottoman Empire had developed politically through the efforts of some spectacularly successful leaders.
One was Mehmet I who in 1453 took Constantinople from the Byzantine Empire.
Then there was Selim I who conquered Egypt in 1517,
followed by Suleyman the Magnificent's series of triumphs across the Middle East
and further expansion into southwestern Europe, North Africa, and the Mediterranean.
The Ottomans had a far from constitutional process for succession.
The sultan often had many concubines who lived together in the harem,
which was not, as is often depicted, a kind of brothel,
but instead the seat of government.
It was a place for state business, policy decision-making, and other important matters.
But after any one of the sultan's partners gave birth to a son,
she and her son usually moved to the provinces,
where the boy learned rulership skills while also developing a network of followers.
And then when the sultan died, the oldest son usually succeeded him,
but not always.
Factions, often developed by an aspiring son's mother, struggled for a place in the empire.
Unsurprisingly, murder was often involved.
A new sultan's brothers were usually murdered on his accession to the throne so they couldn't plot coups.
All in all, they could have used some good family therapy.
But on the other hand, you know, kingmaking is kind of an inherently dirty business.
Thanks Thought Bubble.

Despite that not-very-secure-sounding system, the absolutist Ottoman state was among the longest lived empires in history, lasting until 1922, at which point Constantinople became Istanbul, clearing the way for They Might Be Giants to record their third best song.

In any conquered region, the Ottoman government drafted young Christian boys into its army and bureaucracy, educating them, and converting them to Islam.

Taken from their parents, they became part of the janissary corps, in which they could and did rise to the highest reaches of government alongside advisors and bureaucrats from influential families.

The rulers and nobility also developed a different household type, including multiple wives and large numbers of offspring.

Given Ottoman men's service as ghazis, or warriors, and given the immense slaughter across the entire European population at the time, having many wives seemed like the prudent thing to do because there just weren't that many men.

Women in these households were often wealthy and empowered to purchase warehouses and manufacturing establishments, whereas women to the west often did not have inheritance or property rights.

And when men were off fighting, women served as unofficial replacements in the Ottoman Empire -- Hurrem, the sole wife of Suleyman being a prime example.

And in communities where many girls and women were left in seclusion, other women had opportunities to serve as their lawyers, accountants, and scribes, and doctors, and teachers, and other professionals.

So the Ottomans had developed different social structures and state structures.

I know it's tempting to view all of this through a modern lens, and think about this is good, this is bad, this is modern, and this is not modern.

I don't think that's the right lens through which to view all of this.

We're talking about the 17th Century, so we should compare it to the rest of the 17th Century.

And in many ways, the 17th Century Ottoman Empire had big advantages over other European communities, but after their failure to capture Vienna in 1683, which we'll get to in a minute, the Empire's competitive edge did dull.

Nearby, Russia was also expanding thanks to Ivan IV, aka Ivan the Terrible, who did have vicious outbursts of temper and, also, did kill his own son during a quarrel, which to be fair is kind of terrible.

Ivan's grandfather Ivan III had begun growing the Russian empire as well as creating a modern state structure, complete with administrative departments and functionaries.

He also oversaw extensive building at the Kremlin complex.

The first part of Ivan IV's rule continued Russia's institutional development with the creation of an improved code of laws and better tax collection.

Ivan also summoned distinguished representatives of the orthodox church and the nobility along with wealthy townspeople to an assembly (zemskii sobor), which continued to meet.

And for these accomplishments, as well as Ivan's expansionist ambitions, many historians have restored the word groznyi -- once interpreted to mean "terrible" -- to the meaning held by Russians of his day: Ivan the "formidable," or "fearsome," or even "awesome."

Meanwhile high churchmen were working to make Ivan literally awesome by creating imagery in churches of a tsar connected to the divine.

They also depicted the connection between the tsar and people along a divine continuum.

At the time, the head of the Orthodox church claimed that the Russian ruler was, quote, "everywhere under the vault of heaven the one Christian Tsar, mounted on the holy throne of God of the holy apostolic church, in place of the Roman and Constantinopolitan [thrones] in the God-saved city of Moscow."

So, not God Himself or anything -- just mounted on the holy throne of God.

Rather like Louis XIV over in France.

Did the center of the world just open?

Is Jesus in there?

It's a crucifix.

You might be thinking, "did you just shoehorn in this center of the world bit?"

Yeah, I did.

And it's not the first time Jesus has been shoehorned in where he doesn't fit well.

If you ever read the accounts of Jesus's life, one thing that you'll note is that, uh, he was never a political leader, nor did he ever choose political leaders, nor did he ever express much interest in choosing political leaders.

But just as every religion has to adapt to the culture in which it finds itself, cultures have to adapt to religions.

It's this endless, very complicated dance.

And that's how you end up with one guy mounted on the holy throne of God in Russia, and a different guy mounted on the holy throne of God in France.

But back to Russia.

As it bureaucratized along the lines of the western European kingdoms, Russia developed the rituals of a top-down autocratic state, which lasted into the twentieth-century.

Serfs -- that is, laborers bound to the land and unfree in their movements -- groveled before their lords, who often saw these workers as not even deserving of the word "human."

However, the nobility also groveled in front of the tsar, displaying abject submission akin to what serfs showed their lords.

But it's important to understand that it wasn't as simple as people considering themselves, and others, purely inferior or superior.

Instead, the belief was that everyone had a role to play within the system.

Now, to be clear, within that system, most people had very little freedom or what we would now call "human rights."

But still, throughout history, people have found ways to express human agency no matter the rigidity or oppressiveness of the system in which they are living.

Ivan IV was energetic, especially in the first half of his reign.

He took Russia's borders eastward, capturing among other conquests the Muslim stronghold of Kazan.

Russian settlers headed for new farmland right up to the Pacific Ocean.

And helping Ivan in this conquest, even as absolutist tendencies developed in Russia, was another group of ordinary people who were neither serfs nor noble grovellers but free individuals.

Called Cossacks (from the word Kazak, meaning free), they survived through plunder and trade and through selling their military services to rulers and nobility who needed their fighting skills.

Until late in the seventeenth century, the Cossacks generally looked down on farming.

They led nomadic lives, capturing people to sell or robbing ships on the Caspian Sea.

Located along the Ukrainian, Russian, and Ottoman borderlands, they were more democratic than the rulers to whom they often sold their services, including the Russian tsars whose defeat of Kazan in 1552 they helped facilitate.

After that, the Cossack Yermak Timofeyevich led Russian advances deeper into Siberia with its lucrative fur trade and became a Russian hero.

Ivan IV died in 1584 of a stroke while playing chess, and his heir Fyodor died in 1598, and after that, claimants to the leaderless Russian throne abounded.

Poland-Lithuania spotted an opening for establishing a Polish prince as Russian tsar.

The sense was that Moscow was so disorganized and the monarchy was so weak that it could easily fall.

This resulted in the "Time of Troubles," which was so named because of the famine of 1601-3, as well as Poland-Lithuanian and Swedish attacks on Russia, and the general devastation caused by that warfare.

These finally ended with Russia's victory in 1613 and the ascension to the throne of Michael Romanov -- chosen by an "Assembly of the Land" of nobles and, as the new tsar put it, also chosen by God and the voice of the people.

But mostly by the nobles.

Cossack troops and units from the nobility drove back the enemy, knocking Poland-Lithuania and Sweden out temporarily from the competition for control of the region.

And for their efforts, the new tsar thanked his saviors by raising taxes, cutting back on privileges, and otherwise behaving as if the tsar himself, not his military, had won the day.

But don't worry the nobility will get back at the Romanovs in just 300 short years.

The Cossacks, supported by an increasingly oppressed Ukrainian peasantry, went on to reduce Polish power through war that slaughtered tens of thousands of Jewish estate managers, Protestant minorities, and their supporters living in Ukrainian territory.

In 1654, Russia joined what became known as the Russo-Polish war, at the end of which in 1667 the eastern part of Ukraine including Kiev became part of the Russian empire, while the western part remained part of Poland-Lithuania.

Fortunately, arguments over Ukrainian land had at last been resolved.

What's that, Stan?

Oh.

Still?

Stan, is he behind me?

Because we had a deal that he wasn't going to come out this whole series...GAH...putin.

Right.

Meanwhile, the Polish kingdom, while on a downward path because of these defeats, would live to fight a fair few more battles.

The most famous and consequential of these battles for the continent was the battle for Vienna in 1683 when elected Polish king Jan Sobieski joined forces with the Habsburg monarchy to drive out the invading Ottoman forces.

We previewed this earlier because it's a big deal.

This led to Habsburg rule being solidified around Austria, and Hungary, and other east-central European territories.

And it also meant that Europe was gaining some of the political contours that would shape its modern history.

I mean, there wasn't yet a Germany as such, or even an Austrohungarian Empire, but the scene was being set.

I know we covered A LOT of power and territory struggles today.

There was a lot of war in Europe in the 17th Century.

But if we zoom out, we see generations-long disagreements over how centralized communities should be, and where the right to rule comes from.

These changes were happening in the long run, which is important, but of course no human life is lived in the long run, including yours.

Each of us -- whether a Jewish person escaping religious persecution or a woman becoming a lawyer during a time of war -- is profoundly shaped by the short run we happen to inhabit.

Thanks for watching.

I'll see you next time.
