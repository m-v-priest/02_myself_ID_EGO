Hello and welcome to Crash Course European History. I'm John Green, and *as you may know* 如你所知；正如你知道的, medieval 中世纪的 Europe has a terrible reputation 名声；名誉. We often hear that /it was disease- and famine 饥荒-ridden (a.)充斥……的；受虐待的, which it was. Wolves supposedly (ad.)据说，据传 forced (v.) children to marry (v.) at six or eight or ten years old, which was not common 这在当时并不常见, although people did start (v.) marrying (v.) younger, in part because they were also dying younger. We hear that /knights 骑士 in shining armor 盔甲 slaughtered (v.)屠杀 wantonly 肆意地;放纵地, albeit 虽然，尽管 with good manners called chivalry 骑士精神；骑士制度, which is partly true, although 但是，然而 _the chivalric (a.)骑士的；有武士气概的 code_ 行为准则 was in decline 衰落. And we also hear that /it wasn't safe to drink the water, so they drank (v.) beer exclusively 唯一地；专门地 — which, *more on that* in a moment 稍后会详细介绍. But yeah, today we'*re turning (v.) our attention to* these so-called Middle Ages.

But right, so about beer. 但是，啤酒也是如此。 In those days, people did drink beer and ale 麦芽啤酒. They were nutritious 有营养的, and still are, but they also drank other things — milk, other beverages 饮料, and especially water. There were wells 水井 with safe and delicious drinking water. Still, it's true that a lot of bad things did happen in the 14th and 15th centuries: the Black Death 黑死病, the Great Schism 大分裂 in the Catholic Church 天主教会, and the Hundred Years' War 百年战争. Also, in the 14th century, the Little Ice Age 小冰期 began, which meant cooler temperatures and declining harvests 收成, and that contributed to stunting 发育迟缓 and starvation 饥饿.

But let's begin with the Black Death, a huge pandemic 大流行病 of a disease called bubonic plague 腺鼠疫, which spread to Europe from Asia. Many experts believe the plague 瘟疫 originated 起源于 in Tibet as a localized epidemic 地方性流行病 but then spread, carried by rats and mice and fleas 跳蚤. And those animals were able to travel widely because humans were traveling, and the fleas and rats hitched rides 搭便车 with us. So, in that sense, the plague was a product of growing human interconnectedness 相互关联.

Bubonic plague is a horrible disease. After infection 感染 with the bacterium 细菌 Yersinia pestis 鼠疫耶尔森菌, lymph nodes 淋巴结 swell 肿胀 and sometimes burst 破裂. Victims 受害者 often get high fevers 发烧 and vomit 呕吐 blood. Gangrene 坏疽 can cause extremities 四肢 and facial features 面部特征 to turn black with necrosis 坏死 — hence 因此 the Black Death. And depending on the strain 菌株, somewhere between 50 and 60 percent of people infected died. These days, bubonic plague is treatable 可治疗的 by antibiotics 抗生素, but such treatments have only been around for a few decades. As recently as the 20th century, outbreaks 爆发 in India and China killed more than 12 million people.

But the 14th century's Black Death was even worse. Around 25 million people had died in Asia by the time the plague reached Constantinople 君士坦丁堡 in 1347. And within four years, a staggering 惊人的 number of Europeans had died from it, often within two days of becoming infected. People faced a heartbreaking 令人心碎的 decision: whether to risk caring for their ailing 生病的 loved ones or leave them to die alone in the hopes of avoiding infection. Some areas lost up to 80 percent of their population.

The latest research claims that in Europe as a whole, around half of all people died. Death haunted 困扰 every moment. It's difficult to grasp 理解 just how profound 深刻的 the Black Death was, but imagine losing half of your community in a few years to a poorly understood disease. Giovanni Boccaccio wrote:

"Many died in the open street. Others dying in their houses made it known by the stench 恶臭 of their rotting 腐烂的 bodies. Consecrated  consecrated adj. 奉为神圣的；祝圣的 churchyards 墓地 did not suffice 足够 for the burial 埋葬 of the vast multitude 大批 of bodies, which were heaped 堆积 by the hundreds in vast trenches 壕沟, like goods in a ship's hold 船舱."

How different has life become in the last 650 years? The bacterium that caused the Black Death is now available as a plush 毛绒的 stuffed bacterium. They don't actually look that threatening 有威胁的, especially with eyes. But yeah, this is Yersinia pestis, blown up 放大 and made into a stuffed animal. No bacterium. Also, you want to know an interesting fact about me? I can't juggle 玩杂耍.

Amid 在…中间 all this devastation 毁灭, the Hundred Years' War added sustained 持续的 turmoil 混乱 and destruction. The war was fought between the rulers 统治者 of the kingdom 王国 of England and the kingdom of France over who would rule large swathes 大片土地 of continental 欧洲大陆的 Europe, and it actually lasted at least 116 years, beginning in 1337.

One of the most interesting questions in history is whether war leads to instability 不稳定 or instability leads to war, and the truth is probably yes — both. Like, poor harvests and disease outbreaks make war more likely, but war also worsens 使恶化 poor harvests and disease outbreaks. So, amid the huge shocks to Europe that accompanied the Black Death, the Hundred Years' War increased instability in the food supply and also in long-held cultural beliefs, like the code of chivalry.

Chivalry was a set of behaviors toward knightly 骑士的 opponents 对手 whom one would treat on the battlefield with respect and trust — not killing your fellow knight but instead holding him for ransom 赎金 in good condition. Such noble 高尚的 behavior separated the knight from common archers 弓箭手 and mercenaries 雇佣兵. But English kings began to hire such mercenaries from across Europe, who viciously 残酷地 looted 抢劫 and plundered 掠夺 in a way that wasn't terribly chivalrous 有骑士风度的. And some of these knights for hire found it so profitable 有利可图的 to fight that even during truces 休战 and peace treaties 条约, they kept on marauding 抢劫.

The 116 Years' War also changed the nature of war through innovation 创新. Like, non-aristocratic 非贵族的 soldiers from England and Wales used the longbow 长弓, famed 闻名的 for its combined deadly speed and accuracy 准确性, and that helped the English prevail 获胜 at the Battle of Agincourt 阿金库尔战役. Before the Hundred Years' War, the French had innovated 创新 with cannons 大炮 on ships, which the English later used in the war's land battles. Both types of cannons, by the way, relied on 依靠 gunpowder 火药, a Chinese invention.

The Hundred Years' War also saw the spectacular 引人注目的 rise and fall of Joan of Arc 圣女贞德. Born to a prosperous 富裕的 French peasant 农民 family in 1412, when she was 16, England had won enough battles to take over the French throne 王位, confirmed 确认 in the 1420 Treaty of Troyes 特鲁瓦条约. And France seemed leaderless. Visions 幻象 told Joan to get French forces to take to the field and drive out 驱逐 the English so that Charles, whom she believed to be the rightful heir 合法继承人 to the French throne, could be crowned 加冕. And astonishingly 惊人地, this proved successful. By 1429, Charles was Charles VII of France.

But in the process, the Burgundians 勃艮第人, a competing and powerful royal court 王室, captured Joan and turned her over to the English, who burned her at the stake 火刑 in 1431. It's a bad way to go, although there are no good ways.

If it sounds like European life in the 14th and 15th centuries was hard, well, it was. Murder 谋杀 and violent crime 暴力犯罪 rates were likely much higher than they are today, and dying in war was a pretty routine 常规的 risk. Malnutrition 营养不良 and stunting were also very common. Child mortality 死亡率 was astonishingly high — perhaps as many as 50% of children died before the age of five. But at least people were surrounded by the comforts of religion.

The comforts of religion, however, turned out not to be that comforting. Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

In 1300, Pope Boniface VIII 教皇博尼法斯八世 was the leader of the Catholic Church, but he was also an important political figure in Europe. One of Europe's great questions was whether the Church had authority 权威 over the entire Catholic world or if kings had the ultimate 最高的 authority in their kingdoms. Could, for instance, King Philip IV of France tax 对…征税 the Catholic clergy 神职人员 in France? Pope Boniface thought no. He was from a well-connected 人脉广的 and powerful family, and at the start of the 14th century, he was flexing his muscles 展示实力 across the papacy 教皇职位, ultimately 最终 declaring in 1302 that the Pope had supreme 至高无上的 power over everyone.

The timing was bad in that kings were also starting to flex their muscles. They wanted tax money from the Church to expand their administration 行政机构. Boniface threatened to excommunicate 逐出教会 Philip, who then had the Pope kidnapped 绑架. Boniface was reportedly tortured 折磨 in captivity 囚禁 and died soon after his release in 1303.

By 1305, Philip had arranged for the election of a French Pope and his installation 就职 at Avignon 阿维尼翁, just inside what was then the French border, which made people think that the papacy was under the thumb of 受…控制 French kings and distant from its spiritual 精神的 mission — which, you know, it was.

In 1377, Pope Gregory XI 教皇格里高利十一世 decided to move back to Rome, but then he died. The Cardinals 红衣主教, surrounded by loyal 忠诚的 Romans, then elected an Italian Pope, causing the French Cardinals to scatter 分散 and regroup 重组 to elect a French Pope to head the papal court 教廷 in Avignon, which meant there were two Popes, and a schism 分裂 had occurred. Historians, in fact, call it the Great Schism.

Thanks, Thought Bubble.

The Great Schism was a huge blow 打击 to the Church and its claims of spiritual leadership, which had already been harmed by the clergy's inability or unwillingness to provide spiritual guidance 指导 during the Black Death. Priests 牧师 and monks 僧侣 and nuns 修女 had been as frightened of and as vulnerable to 易受…伤害 death as everyone else. And now it wasn't even clear which Pope was the real Pope or which Church was the real Church.

This disunity 分裂, combined with stories of decidedly 显然地 unspiritual indulgences 放纵；赦罪券, all served to undermine 削弱 the Church's authority. Instead, spiritual and other direction came from common people, not the high-and-mighty 趾高气扬的人. Like, Catherine of Siena 锡耶纳的凯瑟琳, for instance, was an ordinary young woman of intense 强烈的 religious faith who was the one who successfully urged 敦促 Pope Gregory XI to return to Rome — although then, of course, he died.

Before Catherine died in 1380 at the age of 33, she'd undertaken 承担 several diplomatic 外交的 missions between the Church and Italian cities and had traveled across the region, urging the clergy to reform 改革 themselves and fortify 加强 their spiritual ministry 事工.

Ultimately, others in the Church called a council 会议 to end the Great Schism, and church leaders finally elected a single Pope, Martin V 马丁五世, in 1417 — although before that, things got truly out of control 失控 when a third Pope was elected for a while. I mean, if you wanted to be Pope, your chances really were never better than in the late Middle Ages.

All of this meant that European Christendom 基督教世界 really was declining in power. And in 1453, the Ottomans 奥斯曼人, a Turkic 突厥的 ethnic group 族群 of Muslims 穆斯林, captured the capital of the Byzantine Empire 拜占庭帝国 with the help, by the way, of a Hungarian munitions 军火 expert who knew about cannons. The Byzantine Emperor had felt that the munition expert's fees 费用 were too high.

The Ottomans already controlled parts of southeastern Europe, but capturing the Byzantine capital and beheading 斩首 its Emperor was a big deal. It was the final fall of the Roman Empire, and Islam 伊斯兰教 went on to replace Christianity as the leading religion in Constantinople, as its famed 著名的 Cathedral 大教堂 became the Hagia Sophia mosque 圣索菲亚清真寺.

And control of Constantinople was a big deal for many reasons, including trade routes 贸易路线, but also because Constantinople at the time was probably Europe's least terrible city.

Meanwhile, the aforementioned 前面提到的 use of mercenaries helped undermine the feudal system 封建制度, in which everyone owed loyalty 忠诚 to a lord 领主, from knights to a serf 农奴 who was bound to 受束缚于 that lord's land. The Black Death and persistent 持续的 warfare helped change that too. And there were also far fewer humans, which meant fewer people to work in agriculture 农业, so serfs could demand their freedom because their labor 劳动力 had become much more valuable.

Indeed, peasants 农民 rebelled 起义 when the nobility 贵族 failed to meet their demands for better conditions. Like, in the Peasants' Revolt 农民起义 of 1381 in England, they murdered nobles and sacked 洗劫 castles 城堡 and manor houses 庄园住宅. And in cities, urban artisans 工匠 wanted higher pay and an end to higher taxes. In 1378, the Ciompi, or workers in the cloth trade 布料贸易, rebelled in Florence 佛罗伦萨, demanding an end to harsh 严厉的 prosecution 追究 for debt 债务 and an end to the imposition 征收 of extra taxes. They marched through the streets shouting, "Long live the little people!"

The expansion of rights for artisans and farm workers would, of course, be a very long process, but their growing power and the decline of feudalism 封建主义 was a dramatic 巨大的 shift 转变 for Europe. Even warfare itself had changed. People no longer fought for ethical 道德的 reasons or for God's glory 荣耀 but for fame 名声 and career. As a French chronicler 编年史家 observed, cutting through 剖析 the 116 years of back-and-forth victories and losses, this proverb 谚语 arose about warfare: "That's the way it is with fighting. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose."

As for life in these years, people recited 背诵 proverbs like, "There's nothing more certain than death." Someone along the way added, "And taxes." Other proverbs emphasized 强调 that life had begun to feel like a zero-sum game 零和博弈: "The big fishes eat the smaller." "Men are good so long as it saves their skin."

But in the midst of that, there was also new thinking — not just that of the Ciompi and peasants but of artists and philosophers 哲学家 and architects 建筑师 and others who were simultaneously 同时地 creating Europe's rebirth 重生, or Renaissance 文艺复兴. The great Renaissance Cathedral of Florence was even completed before the end of the Hundred Years' War.

And next week, we'll start there in Florence, which was home to so much of that so-called rebirth. Thanks for watching. I'll see you then.

== 中文释义


大家好，欢迎来到《速成欧洲史》。我是约翰·格林。如你所知，**中世纪欧洲**的名声很差。我们常听说那个时代疾病肆虐、饥荒遍野——确实如此。**据说狼患猖獗到迫使儿童在六岁、八岁或十岁就结婚——尽管这种情况并不普遍，但##人们确实开始更早结婚，部分原因是他们的寿命也更短。##**我们听说身着闪亮盔甲的骑士肆意屠杀，尽管他们遵循所谓“骑士精神”的优雅礼仪——这一说法部分属实，不过**"骑士精神准则"当时已在衰落。**我们还听说当时饮用水不安全，因此人们只喝啤酒——关于这点，我们稍后再谈。但没错，今天我们要把目光转向这个所谓的“中世纪”。

[音乐]

好的，先说说啤酒。那时人们确实喝啤酒和麦芽酒。它们富含营养——至今亦然——但人们也喝其他饮品——牛奶、其他饮料，尤其是水。当时有提供安全美味饮用水的水井。尽管如此，**14至15世纪确实发生了许多灾难：黑死病、天主教会大分裂，以及百年战争。**此外，*#14世纪“小冰期”开始，气温下降导致收成减少，进而引发发育不良和饥荒。#*

我们先从**黑死病**说起。**这是一场由"腺鼠疫"引发的大规模瘟疫，**从亚洲传入欧洲。许多专家认为，这场瘟疫起源于西藏的局部疫情，随后由老鼠和跳蚤携带传播。*这些动物之所以能广泛迁徙，是因为人类在四处活动，跳蚤和老鼠便搭了“顺风车”。从这个意义上说，瘟疫是人类日益紧密联系的产物。*

**腺鼠疫是一种可怕的疾病。感染"鼠疫耶尔森菌"后，##淋巴结会肿胀，有时甚至溃烂。##患者常出现高烧和咳血症状。#坏疽会导致四肢和面部因坏死而变黑#——“黑死病”因此得名。根据病毒株的不同，#约50%至60%的感染者会死亡。#**如今，腺鼠疫可用抗生素治疗，但这类疗法仅出现了几十年。近至20世纪，印度和中国的疫情仍导致超过1200万人死亡。

但14世纪的黑死病更为惨烈。1347年瘟疫抵达君士坦丁堡时，亚洲已有约2500万人死亡。四年内，大量欧洲人染病身亡，**许多人在感染后两天内就离世。人们面临一个心碎的抉择：是冒险照顾患病的亲人，还是为避免感染而任由他们孤独死去。**有些地区人口减少了80%。

**最新研究称，欧洲整体约有一半人口死亡。**死亡时刻笼罩着人们。很难想象黑死病的影响有多深远，但请想象一下，几年内你所在的社区因一种未知疾病失去一半人口。乔万尼·薄伽丘写道：
“许多人暴毙于街头。另一些人死于家中，腐烂的尸体散发的恶臭暴露了他们的死讯。 consecrated教堂墓地不足以安葬海量尸体，数百具尸体像船舱里的货物一样被堆进巨大的壕沟。”

过去650年，生活发生了多大变化？导致黑死病的细菌如今被制成了毛绒玩具。它们看起来并不那么可怕，尤其是带眼睛的版本。但没错，这就是"鼠疫耶尔森菌"，被放大后做成了毛绒玩具。“无细菌版”哦。另外，想知道我的一个有趣事实吗？我不会玩杂耍。

**在这场浩劫中，"百年战争"又雪上加霜，**带来了持续的动荡和破坏。**这场战争是英格兰王国, 与法兰西王国的统治者, 为争夺欧洲大陆大片领土的统治权, 而爆发的，实际上持续了至少116年，**始于1337年。

历史上最有趣的问题之一是：**#究竟是战争导致动荡，还是动荡引发战争？答案可能是两者兼有。#**比如，收成不好和疾病爆发, 会增加战争的可能性，但战争也会加剧粮食短缺和疾病传播。因此，*在黑死病给欧洲带来巨大冲击的同时，百年战争进一步加剧了粮食供应的不稳定，也动摇了骑士精神等长期存在的文化信仰。*

**#骑士精神是一套对待"战场上敌方骑士"的行为准则——需以尊重和信任相待，不杀死对方骑士，而是将其扣押以换取赎金，并确保其待遇良好。#**这种高尚行为, 将骑士, 与普通弓箭手和雇佣兵区分开来。*但英国国王开始从欧洲各地雇佣雇佣兵，这些人以极不骑士精神的方式肆意掠夺。有些雇佣兵发现参战有利可图，甚至在休战期和签订和约期间仍继续劫掠。*

这场持续116年的战争, 还通过创新改变了战争的本质。例如，英格兰和威尔士的非贵族士兵使用长弓，以惊人的速度和准确性著称，这帮助英军在阿金库尔战役中获胜。百年战争前，法国人已在船上创新使用火炮，后来英国人将其用于陆战。顺便说一句，这两种火炮都依赖火药——一项中国发明。

**百年战争中还出现了"(法国)圣女贞德"的传奇**兴衰。她于1412年出生在法国一个富裕的农民家庭。16岁时，*英国已通过多次战役, 夺取法国王位，并在1420年《特鲁瓦条约》中得以确认。法国看似群龙无首。贞德称自己收到神启，要带领法军出战，驱逐英军，让她认定的法国王位合法继承人查理加冕。令人惊讶的是，这一目标实现了。1429年，查理成为法国国王查理七世。*

**但在此过程中，敌对的(法国)勃艮第王室, 抓获了贞德，并将她交给英国人。1431年，英国人将她处以火刑。**这是一种痛苦的死法，尽管没有哪种死法是好受的。

**如果听起来14至15世纪的欧洲生活很艰辛——确实如此。##谋杀和暴力犯罪率可能比今天高得多，##死于战争是一种常见风险。营养不良和发育不良也很普遍。#儿童死亡率高得惊人——可能多达50%的儿童在五岁前夭折。#**但至少人们还有宗教的慰藉。

然而，宗教的慰藉并不那么令人慰藉。让我们进入“思想泡泡”环节。

1300年，**教皇博尼法斯八世**是天主教会的领袖，同时也是欧洲重要的政治人物。*##欧洲的一大争议是：教会是否拥有统治"整个天主教世界"的权威，还是国王"在其王国内拥有最高权力"？例如，法国国王菲利普四世, 能否对法国的天主教神职人员征税？##博尼法斯认为不行*。他出身于人脉广泛的权贵家族，在14世纪初，他试图在教皇职权范围内大展拳脚，最终于1302年宣布教皇对所有人拥有至高权力。

但时机不佳，因为**#国王们也开始巩固自己的权力。他们想从教会获取税收, 以扩张行政体系。#**博尼法斯威胁要将菲利普逐出教会，后者则派人绑架了教皇。据报道，博尼法斯在囚禁中遭受酷刑，1303年获释后不久便去世。

1305年，*#菲利普促成选举一位法国人为教皇，并将其安置在阿维尼翁——当时刚好处在法国边境内。这让人们认为教皇权力受制于法国国王，且背离了其精神使命——事实的确如此。#*

1377年，**##教皇格里高利十一世决定迁回罗马，##但随后去世。枢机主教们在忠于罗马的民众包围下，选举了一位意大利人为教皇，导致##法国枢机主教们四散重组，选举了一位法国教皇，##**在阿维尼翁领导教廷。*#这意味着出现了两位教皇，教会大分裂由此发生。历史学家称其为“大分裂”。#*

感谢“思想泡泡”。

大分裂, 对教会及其精神领袖的宣称, 是沉重打击——*##黑死病期间, 神职人员无力或不愿提供精神指引，已损害了教会的权威。##牧师、修士和修女与其他人一样害怕死亡，也同样脆弱。#如今，人们甚至不清楚哪位教皇是正统，哪个教会是真教会。#*

**这种分裂，加上关于“非精神性赎罪券”的传闻，共同削弱了教会的权威。**相反，精神指引和其他方向来自普通人，而非高高在上的权贵。例如，锡耶纳的凯瑟琳是一位信仰虔诚的普通年轻女性，正是她成功敦促格里高利十一世返回罗马——尽管他随后去世了。

凯瑟琳于1380年去世，年仅33岁。此前，她在教会与意大利各城市之间, 多次担任外交使命，并在该地区四处奔走，敦促神职人员自我革新，强化精神牧养。

**最终，教会内部有人呼吁召开会议, 结束大分裂。**1417年，教会领袖终于选举出唯一的教皇马丁五世——尽管在此之前，曾短暂选举出第三位教皇，局面一度完全失控。我的意思是，*如果你想成为教皇，中世纪晚期的机会真是前所未有的多。这一切意味着欧洲基督教世界的权力确实在衰落。*

*1453年，奥斯曼人——一个突厥穆斯林族群*——在一位了解火炮的匈牙利军火专家帮助下，**攻占了拜占庭帝国的首都。**顺便说一句，拜占庭皇帝曾认为这位军火专家的要价太高。

奥斯曼人此前已控制东南欧部分地区，但攻占拜占庭首都并斩首其皇帝, 意义重大。**这是罗马帝国的最终灭亡，**伊斯兰教继而取代基督教,  成为君士坦丁堡的主要宗教，该市著名的大教堂, 也变为圣索菲亚清真寺。

**控制君士坦丁堡之所以重要，原因有很多，包括贸易路线，**但也因为当时君士坦丁堡可能是欧洲“最不糟糕”的城市。

与此同时，前面提到的雇佣兵的使用，动摇了封建制度——在这一制度下，从骑士到依附于领主土地的农奴，所有人都需向领主效忠。**#黑死病和持续的战争#**也推动了这一变化。*#人口大幅减少，意味着农业劳动力短缺，农奴因此可以要求自由，因为他们的劳动力变得更加宝贵。#*

事实上，**当贵族未能满足改善条件的要求时，农民便发起了起义。**例如，1381年英国的农民起义中，他们杀害贵族，洗劫城堡和庄园。**在城市中，手工业者要求更高的工资和终止苛税。**1378年，佛罗伦萨的“梳毛工”（即从事布料贸易的工人）发动起义，要求停止因债务进行的严厉追责，并终止额外征税。他们高呼“小人物万岁！”在街头游行。

**手工业者和农场工人权利的扩大, 当然是一个漫长的过程，但他们日益增长的力量, 和封建制度的衰落，是欧洲的一次巨大转变。**甚至战争本身也发生了变化。人们不再为道德理由或上帝的荣耀而战，而是为了名声和职业发展。正如一位法国编年史家在梳理116年的胜负交替后，总结出关于战争的谚语：“打仗就是这样，有时你赢，有时你输。”

*#至于这些年的生活，人们吟诵着诸如“没有什么比死亡更确定”的谚语。后来有人补充了一句：“还有税收。”其他谚语则强调生活已变成一场"零和游戏"：“大鱼吃小鱼。”“人只为自保才做好事。”(即现实化了)#*

*但在此期间，也出现了新思想*——不仅来自梳毛工和农民，也来自艺术家、哲学家、建筑师和其他人士，他们同时在创造欧洲的“重生”，**即文艺复兴。**佛罗伦萨伟大的文艺复兴大教堂, 甚至在百年战争结束前就已完工。

下周，我们将从佛罗伦萨开始讲起——那里是许多所谓“重生”的发源地。感谢观看，到时见。

Hello and welcome to Crash Course European History. I'm John Green, and as you may know, medieval Europe has a terrible reputation. We often hear that it was disease- and famine-ridden, which it was. Wolves supposedly forced children to marry at six or eight or ten years old, which was not common, although people did start marrying younger, in part because they were also dying younger. We hear that knights in shining armor slaughtered wantonly, albeit with good manners called chivalry, which is partly true, although the chivalric code was in decline. And we also hear that it wasn't safe to drink the water, so they drank beer exclusively -- which, more on that in a moment. But yeah, today we're turning our attention to these so-called Middle Ages.

[Music]

But right, so about beer. In those days, people did drink beer and ale. They were nutritious, and still are, but they also drank other things -- milk, other beverages, and especially water. There were wells with safe and delicious drinking water. Still, it's true that a lot of bad things did happen in the 14th and 15th centuries: the Black Death, the Great Schism in the Catholic Church, and the Hundred Years' War. Also, in the 14th century, the Little Ice Age began, which meant cooler temperatures and declining harvests, and that contributed to stunting and starvation.

But let's begin with the Black Death, a huge pandemic of a disease called bubonic plague, which spread to Europe from Asia. Many experts believe the plague originated in Tibet as a localized epidemic but then spread, carried by rats and mice and fleas. And those animals were able to travel widely because humans were traveling, and the fleas and rats hitched rides with us. So, in that sense, the plague was a product of growing human interconnectedness.

Bubonic plague is a horrible disease. After infection with the bacterium Yersinia pestis, lymph nodes swell and sometimes burst. Victims often get high fevers and vomit blood. Gangrene can cause extremities and facial features to turn black with necrosis -- hence the Black Death. And depending on the strain, somewhere between 50 and 60 percent of people infected died. These days, bubonic plague is treatable by antibiotics, but such treatments have only been around for a few decades. As recently as the 20th century, outbreaks in India and China killed more than 12 million people.

But the 14th century's Black Death was even worse. Around 25 million people had died in Asia by the time the plague reached Constantinople in 1347. And within four years, a staggering number of Europeans had died from it, often within two days of becoming infected. People faced a heartbreaking decision: whether to risk caring for their ailing loved ones or leave them to die alone in the hopes of avoiding infection. Some areas lost up to 80 percent of their population.

The latest research claims that in Europe as a whole, around half of all people died. Death haunted every moment. It's difficult to grasp just how profound the Black Death was, but imagine losing half of your community in a few years to a poorly understood disease. Giovanni Boccaccio wrote:

"Many died in the open street. Others dying in their houses made it known by the stench of their rotting bodies. Consecrated churchyards did not suffice for the burial of the vast multitude of bodies, which were heaped by the hundreds in vast trenches, like goods in a ship's hold."

How different has life become in the last 650 years? The bacterium that caused the Black Death is now available as a plush stuffed bacterium. They don't actually look that threatening, especially with eyes. But yeah, this is Yersinia pestis, blown up and made into a stuffed animal. No bacterium. Also, you want to know an interesting fact about me? I can't juggle.

Amid all this devastation, the Hundred Years' War added sustained turmoil and destruction. The war was fought between the rulers of the kingdom of England and the kingdom of France over who would rule large swathes of continental Europe, and it actually lasted at least 116 years, beginning in 1337.

One of the most interesting questions in history is whether war leads to instability or instability leads to war, and the truth is probably yes -- both. Like, poor harvests and disease outbreaks make war more likely, but war also worsens poor harvests and disease outbreaks. So, amid the huge shocks to Europe that accompanied the Black Death, the Hundred Years' War increased instability in the food supply and also in long-held cultural beliefs, like the code of chivalry.

Chivalry was a set of behaviors toward knightly opponents whom one would treat on the battlefield with respect and trust -- not killing your fellow knight but instead holding him for ransom in good condition. Such noble behavior separated the knight from common archers and mercenaries. But English kings began to hire such mercenaries from across Europe, who viciously looted and plundered in a way that wasn't terribly chivalrous. And some of these knights for hire found it so profitable to fight that even during truces and peace treaties, they kept on marauding.

The 116 Years' War also changed the nature of war through innovation. Like, non-aristocratic soldiers from England and Wales used the longbow, famed for its combined deadly speed and accuracy, and that helped the English prevail at the Battle of Agincourt. Before the Hundred Years' War, the French had innovated with cannons on ships, which the English later used in the war's land battles. Both types of cannons, by the way, relied on gunpowder, a Chinese invention.

The Hundred Years' War also saw the spectacular rise and fall of Joan of Arc. Born to a prosperous French peasant family in 1412, when she was 16, England had won enough battles to take over the French throne, confirmed in the 1420 Treaty of Troyes. And France seemed leaderless. Visions told Joan to get French forces to take to the field and drive out the English so that Charles, whom she believed to be the rightful heir to the French throne, could be crowned. And astonishingly, this proved successful. By 1429, Charles was Charles VII of France.

But in the process, the Burgundians, a competing and powerful royal court, captured Joan and turned her over to the English, who burned her at the stake in 1431. It's a bad way to go, although there are no good ways.

If it sounds like European life in the 14th and 15th centuries was hard, well, it was. Murder and violent crime rates were likely much higher than they are today, and dying in war was a pretty routine risk. Malnutrition and stunting were also very common. Child mortality was astonishingly high -- perhaps as many as 50% of children died before the age of five. But at least people were surrounded by the comforts of religion.

The comforts of religion, however, turned out not to be that comforting. Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

In 1300, Pope Boniface VIII was the leader of the Catholic Church, but he was also an important political figure in Europe. One of Europe's great questions was whether the Church had authority over the entire Catholic world or if kings had the ultimate authority in their kingdoms. Could, for instance, King Philip IV of France tax the Catholic clergy in France? Pope Boniface thought no. He was from a well-connected and powerful family, and at the start of the 14th century, he was flexing his muscles across the papacy, ultimately declaring in 1302 that the Pope had supreme power over everyone.

The timing was bad in that kings were also starting to flex their muscles. They wanted tax money from the Church to expand their administration. Boniface threatened to excommunicate Philip, who then had the Pope kidnapped. Boniface was reportedly tortured in captivity and died soon after his release in 1303.

By 1305, Philip had arranged for the election of a French Pope and his installation at Avignon, just inside what was then the French border, which made people think that the papacy was under the thumb of French kings and distant from its spiritual mission -- which, you know, it was.

In 1377, Pope Gregory XI decided to move back to Rome, but then he died. The Cardinals, surrounded by loyal Romans, then elected an Italian Pope, causing the French Cardinals to scatter and regroup to elect a French Pope to head the papal court in Avignon, which meant there were two Popes, and a schism had occurred. Historians, in fact, call it the Great Schism.

Thanks, Thought Bubble.

The Great Schism was a huge blow to the Church and its claims of spiritual leadership, which had already been harmed by the clergy's inability or unwillingness to provide spiritual guidance during the Black Death. Priests and monks and nuns had been as frightened of and as vulnerable to death as everyone else. And now it wasn't even clear which Pope was the real Pope or which Church was the real Church.

This disunity, combined with stories of decidedly unspiritual indulgences, all served to undermine the Church's authority. Instead, spiritual and other direction came from common people, not the high-and-mighty. Like, Catherine of Siena, for instance, was an ordinary young woman of intense religious faith who was the one who successfully urged Pope Gregory XI to return to Rome -- although then, of course, he died.

Before Catherine died in 1380 at the age of 33, she'd undertaken several diplomatic missions between the Church and Italian cities and had traveled across the region, urging the clergy to reform themselves and fortify their spiritual ministry.

Ultimately, others in the Church called a council to end the Great Schism, and church leaders finally elected a single Pope, Martin V, in 1417 -- although before that, things got truly out of control when a third Pope was elected for a while. I mean, if you wanted to be Pope, your chances really were never better than in the late Middle Ages.

All of this meant that European Christendom really was declining in power. And in 1453, the Ottomans, a Turkic ethnic group of Muslims, captured the capital of the Byzantine Empire with the help, by the way, of a Hungarian munitions expert who knew about cannons. The Byzantine Emperor had felt that the munition expert's fees were too high.

The Ottomans already controlled parts of southeastern Europe, but capturing the Byzantine capital and beheading its Emperor was a big deal. It was the final fall of the Roman Empire, and Islam went on to replace Christianity as the leading religion in Constantinople, as its famed Cathedral became the Hagia Sophia mosque.

And control of Constantinople was a big deal for many reasons, including trade routes, but also because Constantinople at the time was probably Europe's least terrible city.

Meanwhile, the aforementioned use of mercenaries helped undermine the feudal system, in which everyone owed loyalty to a lord, from knights to a serf who was bound to that lord's land. The Black Death and persistent warfare helped change that too. And there were also far fewer humans, which meant fewer people to work in agriculture, so serfs could demand their freedom because their labor had become much more valuable.

Indeed, peasants rebelled when the nobility failed to meet their demands for better conditions. Like, in the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 in England, they murdered nobles and sacked castles and manor houses. And in cities, urban artisans wanted higher pay and an end to higher taxes. In 1378, the Ciompi, or workers in the cloth trade, rebelled in Florence, demanding an end to harsh prosecution for debt and an end to the imposition of extra taxes. They marched through the streets shouting, "Long live the little people!"

The expansion of rights for artisans and farm workers would, of course, be a very long process, but their growing power and the decline of feudalism was a dramatic shift for Europe. Even warfare itself had changed. People no longer fought for ethical reasons or for God's glory but for fame and career. As a French chronicler observed, cutting through the 116 years of back-and-forth victories and losses, this proverb arose about warfare: "That's the way it is with fighting. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose."

As for life in these years, people recited proverbs like, "There's nothing more certain than death." Someone along the way added, "And taxes." Other proverbs emphasized that life had begun to feel like a zero-sum game: "The big fishes eat the smaller." "Men are good so long as it saves their skin."

But in the midst of that, there was also new thinking -- not just that of the Ciompi and peasants but of artists and philosophers and architects and others who were simultaneously creating Europe's rebirth, or Renaissance. The great Renaissance Cathedral of Florence was even completed before the end of the Hundred Years' War.

And next week, we'll start there in Florence, which was home to so much of that so-called rebirth. Thanks for watching. I'll see you then.
