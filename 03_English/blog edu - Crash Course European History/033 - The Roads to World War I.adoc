Hi, I'm John Green 约翰·格林, and this is Crash Course European History 欧洲历史速成课, and things are indeed on course to crash, because World War I 第一次世界大战 is coming. +

Decades ago, when I studied European history in high school, I learned there were precise 精确的；准确的 causes of the war: the alliance system 联盟体系, arms build-up 军备扩充, secret treaties 秘密条约, nationalism 民族主义, and imperialism 帝国主义. That set of causes, launched from above by political leaders, eventually led to war. +

But more recently, historians 历史学家 have started to lay out 阐述；说明 a more complex 复杂的 road to war: namely 即；也就是, a road that passed through social and cultural change at the turn of the century 在世纪之交. And those changes, which were experienced by tens of thousands if not millions of people, caused tensions 紧张局势 across a broad swath 大片地区 of Europe. +

People's lives were affected by changing family structures 家庭结构, by paradigm shifts 范式转变 in science, disruption 扰乱；破坏 of traditional gender roles 传统性别角色, achievement 实现；获得 of the vote 选举权 by working men, and ongoing 持续的 economic advances 经济发展, and the result was disorientation 迷惘；迷失方向, dislocation 混乱；紊乱, deep resentments 怨恨, and widespread 广泛的 fear -- which, of course, is not too dissimilar from 与…没有太大不同 how an array of 一系列 changes are affecting people today. +

[Intro] +

Some might even say that pre-war 战前的 Europe was a battlefield 战场 before World War I started. Strikes 罢工, which at times 有时 grew violent 暴力的, abounded 大量存在 across Europe -- whether at the oil fields 油田 of Baku 巴库, the farms of Hungary 匈牙利, or the factories of Italy. +

Assassinations 暗杀 were common -- as was everyday violence 暴力行为 against Jewish people 犹太人 and other oppressed 受压迫的 ethnic minorities 少数民族. In 1894, Alfred Dreyfus 阿尔弗雷德·德雷福斯, a Jewish officer 军官 in the French army 法国军队, was tried for 因…受审 espionage 间谍罪, convicted 定罪, and imprisoned 监禁 on Devil's Island 魔鬼岛. +

The evidence against Dreyfus turned out to be fabricated 伪造的, complete with 包括 forged signatures 伪造的签名. Further evidence of his innocence 清白 was that the espionage continued, even after his exile 流放. Passions 情绪 exploded over the case, and anti-Semitism 反犹主义 flourished 盛行, families quarreled 争吵, and assaults 袭击 took place around questions of whether Dreyfus had committed these crimes 犯罪. +

Newspapers took both sides as violence grew. Then in 1898, famed 著名的 novelist 小说家 Émile Zola 埃米尔·左拉's article "J'accuse" exposed 揭露 trumped-up 捏造的 evidence against Dreyfus and helped build support for him. Dreyfus was eventually pardoned 赦免 in 1899, but facts were not enough to stop the growing hatred 仇恨 and anti-Semitism. +

Intense 激烈的 divisions 分裂 within and between communities 社区 were growing elsewhere, too. Ireland 爱尔兰, for one 例如, was on the brink of 濒临；在…的边缘 civil war 内战, with both those opposing 反对 British rule 英国统治 and those favoring 支持 it establishing independent armies 独立军队. +

The distant colonial world 遥远的殖民地世界 was increasingly tense 紧张的 too. Between 1904 and 1908, the German army 德国军队 massacred 屠杀 between 24,000 and 100,000 Herero people 赫雷罗人, who refused to surrender 投降 their lands in southwest Africa 非洲西南部. Those who weren't massacred were driven into distant territory 领土 to starve 饿死. +

Some say that slaughter 屠杀 was a training ground 训练场 for European soldiers who would soon engage in 参与 further war. Around the same time, the French closed the University of Hanoi 河内大学 and arrested 逮捕 or killed prominent 杰出的 teachers and intellectuals 知识分子, and open rebellion 公开叛乱 escalated 升级. +

As one opponent 反对者 said of the French: "Look at those men with blue eyes and yellow beards. They are not our fathers, nor are they our brothers. How can they squat 蹲坐 here, defecating on our heads?" +

And the Boers 布尔人 -- that is 也就是说, farmers with Dutch heritage 荷兰血统 -- of South Africa 南非 likewise 同样地 rebelled against 反抗 the British as the 20th century opened. They were only defeated after many civilians 平民, confined to 被限制在 concentration camps 集中营, died of disease 疾病 or starvation 饥饿. +

South Asians 南亚人 demanded reform 改革 too. They became more militantly 激进地 anti-British and launched 发起 boycotts 抵制 of British goods 英国商品. In 1900, a conglomerate 联合企业 of colonial nations 殖民国家 massacred 屠杀 Chinese civilians 中国平民 involved in the Boxer Rebellion 义和团运动. +

Boxer activists 义和团激进分子 had themselves assassinated 暗杀 European and Chinese Christians 基督徒 in an attempt to 试图 take back 夺回 their empire from white invaders 白人侵略者. All these events suggest that the world was already at war before 1914, although if you've been following this series, or our other series in history, you'll know that war was often happening -- if anything 要说的话, peace, to whatever extent 无论在何种程度上 humans have experienced it, is very much a historical exception 例外情况. +

And that's important to remember when thinking about the ultimately disastrous 灾难性的 system of allegiances 联盟关系 Europe had developed. That system was created by politicians 政治家 to try to prevent wars 战争, or at least to manage 管控 any on the continent 欧洲大陆. +

Foremost 最重要的；首要的 among these politicians was our old friend Otto von Bismarck 奥托·冯·俾斯麦, who'd had no qualms 疑虑；不安 about starting wars to help Germany build its empire 帝国 but then declared 宣布 Germany a "satisfied" nation. Oh, the adjectives 形容词 that haunt 萦绕 us. +

Bismarck wanted peace in Europe and so organized an alliance system 联盟体系 to that end 为此, binding 使结合 Germany and Austria 奥地利 in the Dual Alliance 德奥同盟 of 1879, then adding Italy 意大利 to a Triple Alliance 三国同盟 in 1882. He also allied 使结盟 Germany with Russia 俄罗斯 in the Reinsurance Treaty 再保险条约, another attempt to build coalitions 联盟 so formidable 强大的；令人敬畏的 that large wars would become impossible. +

But all of this was about to change when William II 威廉二世, aka 又名 Kaiser Wilhelm 德皇威廉, came to power 掌权 in Germany in 1890. He rattled the sword 炫耀武力 and called Bismarck's alliances the work of an outmoded 过时的 old man. +

Under William II, the treaty with Russia was canceled 取消, which drove Russia to sign an alliance 联盟 with France 法国 in 1894. William also called for 呼吁 Germany to gain power 获得权力 around the world, expanding into tropical colonies 热带殖民地 to create a German "place in the sun" 阳光下的地盘. +

Which, if you wanna do, you could just try to take Southern France 法国南部. Oh, right, you will. Try to take Southern France. +

Meanwhile 与此同时, the French and British secretly built another alliance -- the "entente cordiale 友好协定". And I'll remind you, I've had three years of high school French 高中法语学习经历. It was based on 基于 military cooperation 军事合作 and even shared military plans 军事计划. +

The entente 协约 became a triple entente 三国协约 when Russia and Britain settled 解决 their colonial differences 殖民分歧 in 1907, uniting 联合 three very different powers 强国. But as they were entente-ing, Europe's powers were also growing their militaries 军队. +

Standing armies 常备军 grew to hundreds of thousands of troops 军队. General staffs 总参谋部 demanded 要求 larger stockpiles 储备；库存 of weapons 武器 and got what they wanted. Most costly 昂贵的 were the "Dreadnoughts 无畏舰", or massive battleships 巨型战列舰 with unprecedented 前所未有的 firepower 火力. +

Britain 英国 launched 建造；推出 the first of these in 1905; others followed. The construction 建造 of battleships 战列舰 in these years employed 雇用 tens of thousands of workers. So through their staffs of public relations experts 公关专家, military hawks 军事鹰派 threatened 威胁 that cutting the production of Dreadnoughts would lead to mass unemployment 大规模失业 and revolution 革命. +

"We want eight and we won't wait" was a popular British chant 口号 for more ships. So, yeah, America didn't invent the military-industrial complex 军事工业综合体. But we did perfect 完善 it. +

So, William II also wanted Dreadnoughts, because he hoped to win the British over to 把…争取过来 an alliance of Teutonic peoples 条顿民族, including especially Germans, that could defeat the "Latins 拉丁人" or "Gauls 高卢人" of southern Europe whom he considered inferior 低等的；次等的. +

William was the grandson 孙子 of Queen Victoria 维多利亚女王 and a staunch 坚定的 anglophile 亲英派, much to the dismay of 使…沮丧 his generals 将军. But rather than taking advice from experts in his government, William used another strategy 策略. +

He avidly 热切地 followed press coverage 新闻报道 of himself and his regime 政权, using that as a monitor 监测手段 of successful policy 政策. He had tantrums 发脾气 and even months of nervous collapse 精神崩溃 when he was criticized in the press and elsewhere, creating an atmosphere of turmoil 混乱 in German policy through erratic 反复无常的 militarism 军国主义. +

So, despite all these attempts to control war through alliances 联盟, the early decades 几十年 of the century were also deadly 致命的 because of revolution 革命 and local wars 局部战争 in Europe itself. In 1905, the people of Russia 俄罗斯 rose up against 反抗 the tsarist regime 沙皇政权. +

They were hard-pressed 处境艰难的 in their daily lives due to 由于 a conflict 冲突 between Russia and Japan 日本 over competing claims 竞争主张 in East Asia 东亚. And the Japanese, who'd been developing a modern army 现代军队 and an industrial economy 工业经济, attacked and crushed 击败 the Russian fleet 舰队 in 1905. +

Ordinary people 普通人 paid the price for 为…付出代价 these losses and rebelled 反抗, but then Tsarist 沙皇的 promises of reform 改革承诺, combined with 结合 armed force 武装力量, eventually restored calm 恢复平静 and preserved 维持 the Romanov grip on power 罗曼诺夫王朝的统治 -- for another decade or so 大约十年左右. +

The Balkans 巴尔干地区 also heated up 局势升温, due to 由于 secret societies 秘密社团 of Balkan peoples 巴尔干民族 that collected arms 收集武器 and organized themselves against the Ottoman 奥斯曼帝国 and Habsburg empires 哈布斯堡王朝, and also had amazing facial hair 令人惊叹的胡须. +

Everything about that photograph 照片 is phenomenal 非凡的, but the best part is that it vaguely 模糊地 resembles 类似于 a cheerleading pyramid 啦啦队金字塔队形... +

Within these secret societies, people moved from safe house 安全藏身处 to safe house as they built networks of militiamen 民兵 ready to sabotage 破坏, assassinate 暗杀, and fight the imperial powers 帝国势力 in order to gain independence 获得独立. +

In the face of 面对 such resistance 抵抗, Turkish nationalists 土耳其民族主义者 demanded a strengthening 加强 of military and administrative institutions 军事和行政机构 in the Ottoman Empire 奥斯曼帝国. Finally, in 1908, a group of officers 军官 called the Young Turks 青年土耳其党人 rebelled 反叛 in the name of 以…的名义 promoting 促进 Turkish ethnicity 土耳其民族. +

They ultimately 最终 pushed aside 排挤 the sultan 苏丹 and replaced him with a pliable 易受影响的；柔顺的 brother who was more submissive to 顺从 the Young Turks, albeit 尽管 guided by a constitution 宪法 and parliament 议会. The Young Turks responded to other people's nationalist dreams 民族主义梦想 by squashing 压制 demands for self-rule 自治要求 from Balkan ethnic groups 巴尔干民族群体. +

Even as the Young Turks inspired 鼓舞 many groups both in Europe and around the world, Austria-Hungary 奥匈帝国 used their revolt 叛乱 as distraction 分散注意力的事物 during which it scooped up 吞并 Bosnia 波斯尼亚. That caused outrage 愤怒 among Serbs 塞尔维亚人 as they had wanted to add Bosnia to a "greater Serbia 大塞尔维亚", while all Balkan peoples' anger against the Young Turks boiled over 爆发. +

Building on 以…为基础 this anger, the Balkan governments of Montenegro 黑山, Bulgaria 保加利亚, Serbia 塞尔维亚, and Greece 希腊 unleashed 发动 the First Balkan War 第一次巴尔干战争 in 1912 against the Ottoman Empire 奥斯曼帝国. They quickly won, only blocked when they tried to march on 向…进军 Constantinople 君士坦丁堡. +

But there was jealousy 嫉妒 among the victors 胜利者 over the splitting up of 瓜分 the territorial gains 领土收益, as there so often is, so in spring 1913, the Second Balkan War 第二次巴尔干战争 erupted 爆发. The main issue 主要问题 this time was the territory awarded to 判给 Bulgaria in the settlement 和解协议. +

Serbia 塞尔维亚, which was backed by 得到…支持 Russia, gained territory from this second war, making Austria-Hungary and Germany anxious 焦虑的, not least because 尤其是因为 the Habsburgs 哈布斯堡家族 were nervous that Austria-Hungary's Slavic population 斯拉夫人口 might want to be part of this exciting new Greater Serbia. +

German public relations people 德国公关人员 swung into action 迅速行动起来, planting 编造 hysterical 歇斯底里的 stories on the growing and lethal 致命的 threat from Slavs 斯拉夫人. So if you're wondering if misinformation 错误信息 can contribute to 导致 a global sense of dis-ease 不安, confusion 困惑, and polarization 两极分化: Yes. Yes, it can. +

The heir to 继承人 the Habsburg imperial throne 哈布斯堡王朝皇位, the Archduke Franz Ferdinand 弗朗茨·斐迪南大公, had a solution for all these problems: restore 恢复 absolutism 专制主义 as it had existed before the revolutions of 1848 1848年革命 and the general liberalization 自由化 of politics. +

"The parliamentary form of government 议会制政府 has outlived its usefulness 已失去效用," an advisor 顾问 to Franz Ferdinand had written as early as 1898. "The so-called individual freedoms 个人自由 must be curtailed 限制." +

Let's Go to the Thought Bubble 思考泡泡. +

In June 1914, a nineteen-year-old Bosnian 波斯尼亚的 bookworm 书虫 named Gavrilo Princip 加夫里洛·普林西普
became one of history's more famous teenagers. +
Princip thrived on 喜欢 reading Sherlock Holmes mysteries 夏洛克·福尔摩斯探案故事
and Sir Walter Scott's 沃尔特·司各特爵士 heart-pounding 扣人心弦的 stories of heroic medieval knights 中世纪英勇骑士的故事. +
And he dreamed of his beloved homeland 祖国 joining Serbia 塞尔维亚,
and the Habsburgs had blocked 阻止 that dream by annexing 吞并 Bosnia in 1908. +
Princip, along with 和 several friends, decided something had to be done,
and when the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie 索菲 came to Sarajevo 萨拉热窝 on June 28th, 1914, the conspirators 阴谋者 saw their chance. +
The Archduke and his wife were traveling unprotected 无保护的 in a convertible 敞篷汽车
-- a perfect assassination 暗杀 opportunity. +
Some of Princip's co-conspirators 同谋者 were too afraid when the moment arrived to actually try to kill the Archduke;
another had a gun malfunction 故障. +
One co-conspirator did manage to throw a grenade 手榴弹 at the Archduke's car,
but he missed 未击中. +
Later in the day, Princip, mourning 哀悼 the failure of his crew's plan over lunch. +
The Archduke and Sophie were on their way to visit victims 受害者 of the grenade attack 手榴弹袭击 in the hospital
when their driver took a wrong turn 走错路
and happened to drive past, of all people, Gavrilo Princip,
who proceeded to 接着；继而 shoot dead 枪杀 both Franz Ferdinand and his wife. +
Thanks, Thought Bubble. +

Some people celebrated 庆祝 the death of the opinionated 固执己见的, radical 激进的 heir to the Habsburg throne, and others were not surprised at the murder 谋杀, given that 鉴于 assassination 暗杀 was an occupational hazard 职业风险 of leadership in these decades. +

After the assassination, heads of state 国家元首 and high officials 高级官员 still went on planned vacations 按计划度假, because everyone expected a diplomatic solution 外交解决方案. Again, assassination was pretty common, and diplomatic solutions always followed. +

People were gripped 吸引；引起兴趣 not by the assassination but by a scandal 丑闻 in France -- the trial for murder 谋杀案审判 of Madame Caillaux 凯奥夫人, who had shot a newspaper publisher 报纸出版商 for exposing 揭露 her husband's extra-marital affairs 婚外情. Seems like the wrong guy to shoot. +

And yet the European powers 欧洲列强 moved almost imperceptibly 难以察觉地 toward war. General staffs 总参谋部 and some officials 官员 had been planning for it, as we have seen, while competition for empire 争夺帝国 and the conduct of empire itself 帝国的统治 were warlike 好战的, and overall social and cultural change had made people tense 紧张的 and even violent 暴力的 toward one another. +

Moreover 此外, wasn't Europe -- from Ireland 爱尔兰 to Russia 俄罗斯 -- simply a violent place where individuals 个人 and governments alike 同样地 were always primed for war 做好战争准备? As the chief of the German General Staff 德国总参谋长 put it in 1912, given Europe's track record 历史记录, "I consider a war to be inevitable 不可避免的. And the sooner the better." +

We can wonder what might've happened if the Archduke's driver hadn't taken that wrong turn 走错路. Or we can wonder what might've happened without Europe's particular configuration 布局；结构 of alliances 联盟, or if militarization 军事化 hadn't made war seem unavoidable 不可避免的. +

As Margaret Atwood 玛格丽特·阿特伍德 writes in The Testaments 《遗嘱》, "Very little in history is inevitable." But the lead-up to the war 战争的前奏 was marked not by one cause 原因, or even by a few politicians making a few decisions, but by many people making many decisions -- from spreading fake news stories 传播假新闻 to pressing for 迫切要求 more battleships 战列舰 -- that altogether contributed to 促成 an environment that made war progressively 逐渐地 more likely. +

In short 简而言之, it wasn't only the Archduke's driver who made a wrong turn. +

Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time. +

大家好，我是约翰·格林，这里是《速成欧洲史》，而且事情确实正朝着爆发冲突的方向发展，因为第一次世界大战（World War I）就要来临了。 +

几十年前，我在高中学习欧洲历史时，了解到这场战争有着确切的起因：联盟体系、军备扩充、秘密条约、民族主义（nationalism）和帝国主义（imperialism）。由政治领导人从上层推动的这些因素，最终导致了战争的爆发。 +

但最近，历史学家们开始阐述一条通向战争的更为复杂的道路：具体来说，这是一条在世纪之交经历了社会和文化变革的道路。而这些变革，即使没有数百万人，也有成千上万人经历过，它们在欧洲的广大地区引发了紧张局势。 +

人们的生活受到家庭结构变化、科学范式转变、传统性别角色的打破、劳动男性获得选举权，以及持续的经济发展等因素的影响，结果导致了人们的迷茫、流离失所、深深的怨恨以及普遍的恐惧——当然，这与如今一系列变化对人们的影响并无太大不同。 +

[开场介绍] +

有些人甚至会说，在第一次世界大战爆发前，欧洲就已经是一个战场了。罢工在欧洲各地层出不穷，有时还会演变成暴力事件——无论是在巴库（Baku）的油田、匈牙利（Hungary）的农场，还是意大利（Italy）的工厂。 +

暗杀事件屡见不鲜，针对犹太人和其他受压迫的少数民族的日常暴力行为也是如此。1894年，法国军队（French army）中的犹太裔军官阿尔弗雷德·德雷福斯（Alfred Dreyfus）因间谍罪受审，被定罪后囚禁在魔鬼岛（Devil's Island）。 +

后来发现，指控德雷福斯的证据是伪造的，甚至还有伪造的签名。证明他无罪的进一步证据是，即使在他被流放后，间谍活动仍在继续。围绕这个案件，人们情绪激动，反犹主义（anti-Semitism）盛行，家庭内部发生争吵，还发生了一些关于德雷福斯是否有罪的袭击事件。 +

随着暴力事件的升级，各家报纸各执一词。然后在1898年，著名小说家埃米尔·左拉（Émile Zola）的文章《我控诉》（"J'accuse"）揭露了对德雷福斯的不实指控，并为他赢得了支持。德雷福斯最终在1899年获得赦免，但事实并不足以阻止日益增长的仇恨和反犹情绪。 +

在其他地方，社区内部和社区之间的激烈分歧也在加剧。以爱尔兰（Ireland）为例，它正处于内战的边缘，反对英国统治的人和支持英国统治的人都组建了独立的军队。 +

遥远的殖民世界也日益紧张。在1904年至1908年间，德国军队（German army）屠杀了2.4万至10万名赫雷罗人（Herero people），这些人拒绝交出他们在非洲西南部的土地。那些没有被屠杀的人则被赶到遥远的地方，最终饿死。 +

有人说，那场屠杀是欧洲士兵的训练场，他们很快就会卷入更多的战争。大约在同一时间，法国关闭了河内大学（University of Hanoi），逮捕或杀害了一些杰出的教师和知识分子，公开的反抗活动不断升级。 +

正如一位反对法国的人所说：“看看那些蓝眼睛、黄胡子的人。他们既不是我们的父亲，也不是我们的兄弟。他们怎么能蹲在这里，骑在我们头上作威作福呢？” +

在20世纪初，南非（South Africa）的布尔人（Boers，即具有荷兰血统的农民）同样起来反抗英国（British）。直到许多被关在集中营的平民死于疾病或饥饿后，他们才被打败。 +

南亚人（South Asians）也要求改革。他们变得更加激进地反对英国，并发起了对英国商品的抵制运动。1900年，一群殖民国家屠杀了参与义和团运动（Boxer Rebellion）的中国平民。 +

义和团的激进分子为了从白人侵略者手中夺回自己的国家，暗杀了欧洲人和中国的基督徒。所有这些事件表明，在1914年之前，世界就已经处于战争状态了，不过如果你一直在关注这个系列节目，或者我们的其他历史系列节目，你就会知道战争经常发生——如果说有什么不同的话，人类所经历的任何程度的和平，在历史上都只是非常罕见的例外。 +

在思考欧洲最终形成的灾难性的联盟体系时，记住这一点是很重要的。这个体系是政治家们为了试图防止战争，或者至少是为了控制欧洲大陆上可能发生的任何战争而建立的。 +

在这些政治家中，首当其冲的是我们的老朋友奥托·冯·俾斯麦（Otto von Bismarck），他毫不犹豫地发动战争来帮助德国（Germany）建立帝国，但后来却宣称德国是一个 “满足于现状” 的国家。哦，那些困扰着我们的形容词啊。 +

俾斯麦希望欧洲实现和平，因此为此组织了一个联盟体系。1879年，他使德国和奥地利（Austria）结成了 “德奥同盟”（Dual Alliance），然后在1882年又把意大利纳入其中，组成了 “三国同盟”（Triple Alliance）。他还通过《再保险条约》（Reinsurance Treaty）使德国与俄罗斯（Russia）结盟，这是另一次建立强大联盟的尝试，以确保大规模战争不会发生。 +

但当威廉二世（William II，又称德皇威廉（Kaiser Wilhelm））于1890年在德国掌权后，这一切都即将改变。他挥舞着战剑，称俾斯麦的联盟是一个过时老人的杰作。 +

在威廉二世的统治下，与俄罗斯的条约被取消，这促使俄罗斯在1894年与法国（France）签署了联盟协议。威廉还呼吁德国在世界范围内获取权力，向热带殖民地扩张，为德国创造一个 “阳光下的地盘”。 +

如果你想这么做的话，你本可以尝试夺取法国南部（Southern France）。哦，对了，你会的。尝试夺取法国南部吧。 +

与此同时，法国和英国秘密建立了另一个联盟——“友好协约”（“entente cordiale”）。我要提醒你，我学了三年高中法语。这个协约是基于军事合作，甚至还共享军事计划。 +

当俄罗斯和英国在1907年解决了他们的殖民分歧后，“友好协约” 变成了 “三国协约”（triple entente），将三个截然不同的强国联合在了一起。但在他们结盟的同时，欧洲列强也在扩充自己的军事力量。 +

常备军扩充到了数十万人。总参谋部要求储备更多的武器，并且也得到了他们想要的。其中最昂贵的是 “无畏舰”（“Dreadnoughts”），即拥有空前火力的巨型战舰。 +

英国在1905年下水了第一艘无畏舰，其他国家也纷纷效仿。这些年里，建造战舰雇佣了数万名工人。所以，通过他们的公关专家团队，军事鹰派人士威胁说，削减无畏舰的生产将导致大规模失业和革命。 +

“我们要八艘，而且我们不会等待” 是英国民众中一句流行的口号，要求建造更多的战舰。所以，是的，美国并不是军工复合体（military-industrial complex）的发明者。但我们确实将它完善了。 +

所以，威廉二世也想要无畏舰，因为他希望赢得英国人的支持，建立一个由日耳曼民族（Teutonic peoples）组成的联盟，特别是包括德国人，这个联盟能够打败他认为低人一等的南欧 “拉丁人” 或 “高卢人”（“Latins” or “Gauls”）。 +

威廉是维多利亚女王（Queen Victoria）的孙子，也是一个坚定的亲英派，这让他的将军们非常沮丧。但威廉没有听取政府中专家的建议，而是采用了另一种策略。 +

他热切关注着媒体对他自己和他的政权的报道，并将其作为检验政策是否成功的一个标准。当他在媒体和其他地方受到批评时，他会发脾气，甚至会有数月的精神崩溃，通过反复无常的军国主义在德国的政策中制造了一种动荡的氛围。 +

所以，尽管有这些通过联盟来控制战争的尝试，世纪初的几十年里，由于欧洲自身的革命和局部战争，也同样充满了死亡。1905年，俄罗斯（Russia）人民起来反抗沙皇政权（tsarist regime）。 +

由于俄罗斯和日本（Japan）在东亚地区的利益争夺引发了冲突，俄罗斯人民的日常生活受到了严重的压力。而日本一直在发展现代化的军队和工业经济，在1905年，他们发动攻击并击溃了俄罗斯舰队。 +

普通民众为这些损失付出了代价并奋起反抗，但后来沙皇承诺进行改革，再加上武装力量的镇压，最终恢复了平静，并使罗曼诺夫王朝（Romanov）的统治得以维持——又持续了大约十年左右。 +

巴尔干地区（Balkans）也局势升温，因为巴尔干人民的秘密社团开始收集武器，并组织起来反抗奥斯曼帝国（Ottoman Empire）和哈布斯堡王朝（Habsburg empires），而且他们还留着令人惊叹的胡须。 +

那张照片里的一切都很了不起，但最精彩的部分是它隐约看起来像一个啦啦队的金字塔队形…… +

在这些秘密社团中，人们从一个安全的住所转移到另一个安全的住所，同时建立起了民兵网络，准备进行破坏、暗杀，并与帝国列强作战，以赢得独立。 +

面对这样的抵抗，土耳其民族主义者（Turkish nationalists）要求加强奥斯曼帝国的军事和行政机构。最终，在1908年，一群被称为 “青年土耳其党人”（Young Turks）的军官以促进土耳其民族主义（Turkish ethnicity）的名义发动了起义。 +

他们最终推翻了苏丹（sultan），并让苏丹一位更顺从的兄弟取而代之，尽管这位兄弟在宪法和议会的约束下，但他对青年土耳其党人更加听话。青年土耳其党人通过压制巴尔干各民族的自治要求来回应其他人的民族主义梦想。 +

即使青年土耳其党人在欧洲和世界各地激励了许多团体，奥匈帝国（Austria-Hungary）却利用他们的起义作为幌子，趁机吞并了波斯尼亚（Bosnia）。这引起了塞尔维亚人（Serbs）的愤怒，因为他们原本想把波斯尼亚纳入 “大塞尔维亚”（“greater Serbia”），而所有巴尔干民族对青年土耳其党人的愤怒也达到了极点。 +

基于这种愤怒，黑山（Montenegro）、保加利亚（Bulgaria）、塞尔维亚和希腊（Greece）的巴尔干政府在1912年对奥斯曼帝国发动了第一次巴尔干战争（First Balkan War）。他们很快取得了胜利，只是在试图进军君士坦丁堡（Constantinople）时受阻。 +

但和往常一样，战胜国之间在瓜分领土收益时产生了嫉妒，所以在1913年春天，第二次巴尔干战争（Second Balkan War）爆发了。这次的主要问题是在战后解决方案中分配给保加利亚的领土。 +

在俄罗斯支持下的塞尔维亚从第二次战争中获得了领土，这让奥匈帝国和德国感到不安，尤其是因为哈布斯堡家族担心奥匈帝国的斯拉夫人（Slavic population）可能会想成为这个令人兴奋的新 “大塞尔维亚” 的一部分。 +

德国的公关人员开始行动起来，散布关于斯拉夫人日益增长的致命威胁的恐慌性报道。所以，如果你想知道虚假信息是否会导致全球范围内的不安、困惑和两极分化，答案是：是的，它确实会。 +

哈布斯堡王朝的皇位继承人，弗朗茨·斐迪南大公（Archduke Franz Ferdinand）对所有这些问题有一个解决方案：恢复1848年革命和政治普遍自由化之前存在的专制制度。 +

早在1898年，弗朗茨·斐迪南的一位顾问就写道：“议会制政府已经过时了。所谓的个人自由必须受到限制。” +

让我们进入“思想泡泡”环节。 +

1914年6月，一位名叫加夫里洛·普林西普（Gavrilo Princip）的19岁波斯尼亚（Bosnian）书虫成为了历史上较为著名的青少年之一。 +
普林西普热衷于阅读阿瑟·柯南·道尔（Arthur Conan Doyle）创作的夏洛克·福尔摩斯（Sherlock Holmes）系列推理小说， +
以及沃尔特·司各特爵士（Sir Walter Scott）笔下关于中世纪英勇骑士的扣人心弦的故事。 +
他梦想着他心爱的祖国能够并入塞尔维亚（Serbia）， +
而哈布斯堡王朝在1908年吞并了波斯尼亚，阻断了他的这个梦想。 +
普林西普和他的几个朋友决定必须采取行动， +
当弗朗茨·斐迪南大公和他的妻子索菲（Sophie）在1914年6月28日来到萨拉热窝（Sarajevo）时，这些阴谋者看到了机会。 +
大公和他的妻子乘坐一辆敞篷车，没有任何保护措施， +
这是一个绝佳的暗杀机会。 +
当那一刻到来时，普林西普的一些同谋因为害怕而不敢真的去刺杀大公； +
另一个人的枪出现了故障。 +
有一个同谋确实设法向大公的汽车扔了一枚手榴弹， +
但他没有扔中。 +
当天晚些时候，普林西普在吃午饭时为他们计划的失败而感到沮丧。 +
弗朗茨·斐迪南大公和索菲在去医院看望手榴弹袭击事件的受害者的路上， +
他们的司机拐错了弯， +
恰好从加夫里洛·普林西普身边驶过， +
普林西普随后开枪打死了弗朗茨·斐迪南大公和他的妻子。 +

感谢“思想泡泡”！ +

一些人对这位固执己见、激进的哈布斯堡王朝皇位继承人的死亡表示庆祝，而另一些人对这起谋杀案并不感到惊讶，因为在这几十年里，暗杀是领导人的职业风险之一。 +

暗杀事件发生后，国家元首和高级官员们仍然按计划去度假了，因为每个人都预计会通过外交途径解决问题。再说一次，暗杀事件相当常见，而且总是会有外交解决方案随之而来。 +

人们关注的不是暗杀事件，而是法国的一桩丑闻——卡约夫人（Madame Caillaux）因枪杀了一名揭露她丈夫婚外情的报纸出版商而受审。似乎杀错人了。 +

然而，欧洲列强几乎不知不觉地走向了战争。正如我们所看到的，总参谋部和一些官员一直在为此做准备，而对帝国的争夺以及帝国的统治行为本身就带有战争性质，而且总体的社会和文化变革让人们变得紧张，甚至对彼此充满暴力。 +

此外，从爱尔兰到俄罗斯，欧洲难道不就是一个暴力频发的地方吗？在那里，个人和政府都时刻准备着战争。正如德国总参谋长（chief of the German General Staff）在1912年所说，鉴于欧洲的历史记录，“我认为战争是不可避免的。而且越早越好。” +

我们可以想象，如果大公的司机没有拐错那个弯，事情会怎样发展。或者我们可以想象，如果没有欧洲这种特殊的联盟格局，或者如果没有军事化使得战争看起来不可避免，又会发生什么。 +

正如玛格丽特·阿特伍德（Margaret Atwood）在《遗嘱》（*The Testaments*）中所写：“历史上很少有事情是不可避免的。” 但战争的前奏不是由一个原因导致的，甚至也不是由几个政治家做出的几个决定导致的，而是由许多人做出的许多决定导致的——从传播假新闻到推动建造更多的战舰——所有这些共同营造了一种让战争越来越有可能爆发的环境。 +

简而言之，做出错误转向的不只是大公的司机。 +

感谢观看。我们下次再见。 +

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History, and things are indeed on course to crash, because World War I is coming.

Decades ago, when I studied European history in high school, I learned there were precise causes of the war: the alliance system, arms build-up, secret treaties, nationalism, and imperialism. That set of causes, launched from above by political leaders, eventually led to war.

But more recently, historians have started to lay out a more complex road to war: namely, a road that passed through social and cultural change at the turn of the century. And those changes, which were experienced by tens of thousands if not millions of people, caused tensions across a broad swath of Europe.

People's lives were affected by changing family structures, by paradigm shifts in science, disruption of traditional gender roles, achievement of the vote by working men, and ongoing economic advances, and the result was disorientation, dislocation, deep resentments, and widespread fear -- which, of course, is not too dissimilar from how an array of changes are affecting people today.

[Intro]

Some might even say that pre-war Europe was a battlefield before World War I started. Strikes, which at times grew violent, abounded across Europe -- whether at the oil fields of Baku, the farms of Hungary, or the factories of Italy.

Assassinations were common -- as was everyday violence against Jewish people and other oppressed ethnic minorities. In 1894, Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish officer in the French army, was tried for espionage, convicted, and imprisoned on Devil's Island.

The evidence against Dreyfus turned out to be fabricated, complete with forged signatures. Further evidence of his innocence was that the espionage continued, even after his exile. Passions exploded over the case, and anti-Semitism flourished, families quarreled, and assaults took place around questions of whether Dreyfus had committed these crimes.

Newspapers took both sides as violence grew. Then in 1898, famed novelist Émile Zola's article "J'accuse" exposed trumped-up evidence against Dreyfus and helped build support for him. Dreyfus was eventually pardoned in 1899, but facts were not enough to stop the growing hatred and anti-Semitism.

Intense divisions within and between communities were growing elsewhere, too. Ireland, for one, was on the brink of civil war, with both those opposing British rule and those favoring it establishing independent armies.

The distant colonial world was increasingly tense too. Between 1904 and 1908, the German army massacred between 24,000 and 100,000 Herero people, who refused to surrender their lands in southwest Africa. Those who weren't massacred were driven into distant territory to starve.

Some say that slaughter was a training ground for European soldiers who would soon engage in further war. Around the same time, the French closed the University of Hanoi and arrested or killed prominent teachers and intellectuals, and open rebellion escalated.

As one opponent said of the French: "Look at those men with blue eyes and yellow beards. They are not our fathers, nor are they our brothers. How can they squat here, defecating on our heads?"

And the Boers -- that is, farmers with Dutch heritage -- of South Africa likewise rebelled against the British as the 20th century opened. They were only defeated after many civilians, confined to concentration camps, died of disease or starvation.

South Asians demanded reform too. They became more militantly anti-British and launched boycotts of British goods. In 1900, a conglomerate of colonial nations massacred Chinese civilians involved in the Boxer Rebellion.

Boxer activists had themselves assassinated European and Chinese Christians in an attempt to take back their empire from white invaders. All these events suggest that the world was already at war before 1914, although if you've been following this series, or our other series in history, you'll know that war was often happening -- if anything, peace, to whatever extent humans have experienced it, is very much a historical exception.

And that's important to remember when thinking about the ultimately disastrous system of allegiances Europe had developed. That system was created by politicians to try to prevent wars, or at least to manage any on the continent.

Foremost among these politicians was our old friend Otto von Bismarck, who'd had no qualms about starting wars to help Germany build its empire but then declared Germany a "satisfied" nation. Oh, the adjectives that haunt us.

Bismarck wanted peace in Europe and so organized an alliance system to that end, binding Germany and Austria in the Dual Alliance of 1879, then adding Italy to a Triple Alliance in 1882. He also allied Germany with Russia in the Reinsurance Treaty, another attempt to build coalitions so formidable that large wars would become impossible.

But all of this was about to change when William II, aka Kaiser Wilhelm, came to power in Germany in 1890. He rattled the sword and called Bismarck's alliances the work of an outmoded old man.

Under William II, the treaty with Russia was canceled, which drove Russia to sign an alliance with France in 1894. William also called for Germany to gain power around the world, expanding into tropical colonies to create a German "place in the sun."

Which, if you wanna do, you could just try to take Southern France. Oh, right, you will. Try to take Southern France.

Meanwhile, the French and British secretly built another alliance -- the "entente cordiale." And I'll remind you, I've had three years of high school French. It was based on military cooperation and even shared military plans.

The entente became a triple entente when Russia and Britain settled their colonial differences in 1907, uniting three very different powers. But as they were entente-ing, Europe's powers were also growing their militaries.

Standing armies grew to hundreds of thousands of troops. General staffs demanded larger stockpiles of weapons and got what they wanted. Most costly were the "Dreadnoughts," or massive battleships with unprecedented firepower.

Britain launched the first of these in 1905; others followed. The construction of battleships in these years employed tens of thousands of workers. So through their staffs of public relations experts, military hawks threatened that cutting the production of Dreadnoughts would lead to mass unemployment and revolution.

"We want eight and we won't wait" was a popular British chant for more ships. So, yeah, America didn't invent the military-industrial complex. But we did perfect it.

So, William II also wanted Dreadnoughts, because he hoped to win the British over to an alliance of Teutonic peoples, including especially Germans, that could defeat the "Latins" or "Gauls" of southern Europe whom he considered inferior.

William was the grandson of Queen Victoria and a staunch anglophile, much to the dismay of his generals. But rather than taking advice from experts in his government, William used another strategy.

He avidly followed press coverage of himself and his regime, using that as a monitor of successful policy. He had tantrums and even months of nervous collapse when he was criticized in the press and elsewhere, creating an atmosphere of turmoil in German policy through erratic militarism.

So, despite all these attempts to control war through alliances, the early decades of the century were also deadly because of revolution and local wars in Europe itself. In 1905, the people of Russia rose up against the tsarist regime.

They were hard-pressed in their daily lives due to a conflict between Russia and Japan over competing claims in East Asia. And the Japanese, who'd been developing a modern army and an industrial economy, attacked and crushed the Russian fleet in 1905.

Ordinary people paid the price for these losses and rebelled, but then Tsarist promises of reform, combined with armed force, eventually restored calm and preserved the Romanov grip on power -- for another decade or so.

The Balkans also heated up, due to secret societies of Balkan peoples that collected arms and organized themselves against the Ottoman and Habsburg empires, and also had amazing facial hair.

Everything about that photograph is phenomenal, but the best part is that it vaguely resembles a cheerleading pyramid...

Within these secret societies, people moved from safe house to safe house as they built networks of militiamen ready to sabotage, assassinate, and fight the imperial powers in order to gain independence.

In the face of such resistance, Turkish nationalists demanded a strengthening of military and administrative institutions in the Ottoman Empire. Finally, in 1908, a group of officers called the Young Turks rebelled in the name of promoting Turkish ethnicity.

They ultimately pushed aside the sultan and replaced him with a pliable brother who was more submissive to the Young Turks, albeit guided by a constitution and parliament. The Young Turks responded to other people's nationalist dreams by squashing demands for self-rule from Balkan ethnic groups.

Even as the Young Turks inspired many groups both in Europe and around the world, Austria-Hungary used their revolt as distraction during which it scooped up Bosnia. That caused outrage among Serbs as they had wanted to add Bosnia to a "greater Serbia," while all Balkan peoples' anger against the Young Turks boiled over.

Building on this anger, the Balkan governments of Montenegro, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Greece unleashed the First Balkan War in 1912 against the Ottoman Empire. They quickly won, only blocked when they tried to march on Constantinople.

But there was jealousy among the victors over the splitting up of the territorial gains, as there so often is, so in spring 1913, the Second Balkan War erupted. The main issue this time was the territory awarded to Bulgaria in the settlement.

Serbia, which was backed by Russia, gained territory from this second war, making Austria-Hungary and Germany anxious, not least because the Habsburgs were nervous that Austria-Hungary's Slavic population might want to be part of this exciting new Greater Serbia.

German public relations people swung into action, planting hysterical stories on the growing and lethal threat from Slavs. So if you're wondering if misinformation can contribute to a global sense of dis-ease, confusion, and polarization: Yes. Yes, it can.

The heir to the Habsburg imperial throne, the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, had a solution for all these problems: restore absolutism as it had existed before the revolutions of 1848 and the general liberalization of politics.

"The parliamentary form of government has outlived its usefulness," an advisor to Franz Ferdinand had written as early as 1898. "The so-called individual freedoms must be curtailed."

Let's Go to the Thought Bubble.

In June 1914, a nineteen-year-old Bosnian bookworm named Gavrilo Princip
became one of history's more famous teenagers.
Princip thrived on reading Sherlock Holmes mysteries
and Sir Walter Scott's heart-pounding stories of heroic medieval knights.
And he dreamed of his beloved homeland joining Serbia,
and the Habsburgs had blocked that dream by annexing Bosnia in 1908.
Princip, along with several friends, decided something had to be done,
and when the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie came to Sarajevo on June 28th, 1914, the conspirators saw their chance.
The Archduke and his wife were traveling unprotected in a convertible
-- a perfect assassination opportunity.
Some of Princip's co-conspirators were too afraid when the moment arrived to actually try to kill the Archduke;
another had a gun malfunction.
One co-conspirator did manage to throw a grenade at the Archduke's car,
but he missed.
Later in the day, Princip, mourning the failure of his crew's plan over lunch.
The Archduke and Sophie were on their way to visit victims of the grenade attack in the hospital
when their driver took a wrong turn
and happened to drive past, of all people, Gavrilo Princip,
who proceeded to shoot dead both Franz Ferdinand and his wife.
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

Some people celebrated the death of the opinionated, radical heir to the Habsburg throne, and others were not surprised at the murder, given that assassination was an occupational hazard of leadership in these decades.

After the assassination, heads of state and high officials still went on planned vacations, because everyone expected a diplomatic solution. Again, assassination was pretty common, and diplomatic solutions always followed.

People were gripped not by the assassination but by a scandal in France -- the trial for murder of Madame Caillaux, who had shot a newspaper publisher for exposing her husband's extra-marital affairs. Seems like the wrong guy to shoot.

And yet the European powers moved almost imperceptibly toward war. General staffs and some officials had been planning for it, as we have seen, while competition for empire and the conduct of empire itself were warlike, and overall social and cultural change had made people tense and even violent toward one another.

Moreover, wasn't Europe -- from Ireland to Russia -- simply a violent place where individuals and governments alike were always primed for war? As the chief of the German General Staff put it in 1912, given Europe's track record, "I consider a war to be inevitable. And the sooner the better."

We can wonder what might've happened if the Archduke's driver hadn't taken that wrong turn. Or we can wonder what might've happened without Europe's particular configuration of alliances, or if militarization hadn't made war seem unavoidable.

As Margaret Atwood writes in The Testaments, "Very little in history is inevitable." But the lead-up to the war was marked not by one cause, or even by a few politicians making a few decisions, but by many people making many decisions -- from spreading fake news stories to pressing for more battleships -- that altogether contributed to an environment that made war progressively more likely.

In short, it wasn't only the Archduke's driver who made a wrong turn.

Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time.
