Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History. +

So between 1840 and 1914, an astonishing 惊人的 40 million people left Europe. It was one of the greatest migrations 迁徙 in human history, and it might seem a little odd 奇怪的 because, like, after all, Europe was leading in technological and other innovations 创新 at the time. +

Agriculture 农业 was thriving 繁荣. Railroads 铁路 were creating an increasingly dense network 密集网络 across the continent 大陆 to move goods more efficiently 高效地 and connect people to each other. So why would anyone, let alone 更不用说 40 million people, want to leave the most prosperous 繁荣的 region 地区 in the world? +

Well, for one thing, in many European communities, the idea that people could move was new. Peasants 农民 were less likely to be legally required to work the land their ancestors 祖先 had worked. But also, Europe's prosperity was not universal 普遍的 or even widely shared. And so while nations became richer than ever before, many of the people in those nations were left out of that prosperity. +

The more things change, roll the interest, and I'm about to get political. +

[Music] +

Okay, so one-third of those 40 million emigrants 移民 were from the United Kingdom, which is surprising because the UK was becoming a global world power 全球大国 and perhaps the most prosperous European nation. But you have to remember that at the time, all of Ireland was part of the UK, and in the Hungry 40s, some 1.25 million Irish people migrated 迁移 to avoid starvation 饥饿 -- a good example that inequality 不平等 often coexists with 与…共存 prosperity. +

Then from 1850 until 1914, Irish people migrated at a rate of 65,000 per year -- more than two million additional 额外的 people. Among them were two of my great-grandfathers. This Irish diaspora 散居海外的爱尔兰人, which stretched from Austria to India, was summarized 总结 famously in Irish expat 旅居国外者 James Joyce's novel *Ulysses* when the character Bloom says, "A nation is the same people living in the same place," and then a moment later adds, "or in different places." +

The Western Hemisphere 西半球 was a common destination 目的地 for these new migrants, as were Australia and New Zealand. The first British immigrants 移民 to Australia were convicts 罪犯, but later the British government offered large tracts of land 大片土地 in Australia and New Zealand to wealthy entrepreneurs 企业家 -- land that was seen as available, although in fact, it was the traditional land of Aboriginal people 原住民. +

People also moved in search of 寻找 work opportunities, especially because projects around the world needed laborers 劳动者 once slavery 奴隶制 was abolished 废除. European-based entrepreneurs and colonial plantation owners 殖民种植园主 used agents 代理人 to comb 搜寻 India and China, in particular 尤其, to find workers to indenture 签订契约 -- that is, to bind to a project through a written contract 书面合同. +

They would cajole 哄骗 and routinely 惯常地 lie about working conditions 工作条件 and the lengths of these contracts. Women, for instance 例如, were often promised jobs as nursemaids 保姆 in English households 家庭 and then found themselves shipped to plantations in the Caribbean 加勒比地区 or the South Pacific 南太平洋 or even to brothels 妓院. Similarly, agents manipulated 操纵 people in Scandinavia 斯堪的纳维亚 and Eastern Europe, promising them a golden future 美好未来 and convincing them to emigrate 移民, especially after the global economic downturn 经济衰退 of 1873. +

Thanks to refrigeration 冷藏 and a more global market for meat, prices for food and livestock 家畜 were declining 下降. Villages in some areas were decimated 大批毁灭, especially in places with shorter growing seasons 生长季 like Scandinavia. Soil 土壤, too, was supporting fewer and fewer farmers as food prices declined. +

Between 1886 and 1900, more than 10% of all Swedes emigrated. Many went to North America, which is why the pickled herring 腌鲱鱼 is so good in Minnesota. The experience of these emigrants was mixed 复杂的. In some cases, they built strong and prosperous communities. In others, they struggled mightily 艰难地挣扎. +

Eventually, migration did lose its luster 吸引力 in Sweden, in part because, you know, lots of people had left, which meant there were more work opportunities for the people who remained, and in part because hydroelectric energy 水电 yielded 产生 lots of new jobs in national wealth 国家财富. Renewable energy 可再生能源 -- it's the future and the past. +

In other cases, migrants followed their own family or village networks 网络 to new lands. This is how, for instance, Sicilian emigration 西西里移民 to North America often worked. Sicily had long been denuded of 使…光秃秃 its trees for Greek shipping, and locals were facing taxation 税收 from a new national government that was dominated by 由…主导 manufacturers 制造商 and financiers 金融家 in the north. +

Sicilian men and some women migrated, whether alone or with family, many to North American towns and villages where they worked a variety of jobs. A good number returned home after earning enough to set up a store 开店 or finance 资助 a family member's business. And the women who remained after their male relatives left created clusters 群体 and communities of so-called "widows in white," waiting for funds 资金 to be sent home or for their relatives to return. +

So between 1870 and 1890, most of Europe's emigrants were from prosperous and powerful countries -- 47% came from Britain, another 18% from Germany. But between 1890 and World War I, other regions began to dominate 占主导地位. Millions left Austria-Hungary 奥匈帝国 and the Russian Empire 俄罗斯帝国. +

"Entire regiments 团 left in 1907 in order to earn money in America," wrote one observer of the scene. "Many houses stood empty, and in many others, only old women and small children remained behind. In some villages, the entire young generation 一代 left home. Everyone believed that America was the promised land 应许之地, a true paradise." +

Ah, America, where the streets are paved with cheese. Am I the only person who remembers the movie *An American Tail*? Possibly. Literally, yes. +

Did the center of the world just open? Is there an American flag stuck inside of a Diet Dr. Pepper cannon? There. I'm a little worried this might be against the rules of how you're supposed to display the flag, and I apologize. We didn't have anything else. +

If you've watched a lot of Crash Course, you've seen a lot of this American flag, but did you know that it is not just any American flag? It is the American flag that our friend and colleague Mark was given when he became an American. Our office, like so many offices in the United States, has been tremendously strengthened by immigration 移民. And that shouldn't be a political statement. +

In the Russian Empire, many people left, but especially Jews 犹太人. Christians 基督徒 had assaulted 袭击 Jews and their property for generations in acts called pogroms 大屠杀. And after the assassination 暗杀 of Tsar Alexander II in 1881 by political radicals 政治激进分子, Russians launched more pogroms. +

The government had tried integrating 使融合 their vast empire, composed of 由…组成 more than a hundred different ethnic groups 族群, with a program called Russification 俄罗斯化. But when that did not work to its satisfaction, the government changed course 改变策略 toward negative integration 消极融合, vilifying 诋毁 non-Russian ethnic and religious groups, expelling 驱逐 or restricting 限制 several of them. Jews were foremost among those groups. +

One active vilification 诋毁 really stands out. Officials in the police department of the Ministry of the Interior 内政部 produced a phony account 虚假描述 called *The Protocols of the Elders of Zion*. It documented 记录 a Jewish plot 阴谋 -- entirely concocted by 完全由…编造 these Russian officials -- for a Jewish takeover of the world. And that forgery 伪造品 shows us just how determined people were to demonize 妖魔化 Jews so that they could be persecuted 迫害, expelled, and even killed. +

In fact, *The Protocols* spread across Europe and the world with increasingly disastrous results 灾难性后果. And even today, it often fuels 加剧 anti-Semitic conspiracy theories 反犹阴谋论. +

And in this atmosphere of escalating pogroms and persecution 迫害, Ukrainians 乌克兰人, Lithuanians 立陶宛人, Poles 波兰人, and others fled the Russian Empire at the turn of the 20th century. Among them, tens of thousands of Jewish people. In contrast 相比之下, non-Jewish ethnic Russians 非犹太族俄罗斯人 were forbidden to leave. +

So, as in Ireland, migration from the Russian Empire had an ethnic 种族的, religious 宗教的, and class dimension 层面 that was fostered by 由…促成 governments and their agents. +

In Hungary 匈牙利, agents searched out 搜寻 Croatians 克罗地亚人, Ukrainians, and other ethnicities 族群 -- often the poorest in society -- to sign up for 报名参加 foreign ventures 海外项目. This was part of Hungary's attempt to Magyarize 使马扎尔化 Hungarian society -- that is, make the population more culturally Hungarian. +

In Austria-Hungary, some officials promoted 推动 migration, but others were opposed to 反对 it, and each group of opponents had their own reasons. Military planners 军事规划者 saw villages emptied of potential recruits 潜在新兵. Nationalists 民族主义者 wanted people of their own ethnicity blocked from leaving their communities. And large landowners 大地主 often found that cheap local labor 廉价本地劳动力 had fled to places where there were better jobs. +

In 1903, the government decreed 颁布法令 that Hungarian men would not be allowed to emigrate, although loopholes 漏洞 kept this draconian law 严苛的法律 from ever being fully effective. Austria had especially attempted to curb emigration 控制移民 without much luck. Emperor Francis Joseph even sponsored 资助 a project to try to get emigrants to return. +

Other efforts to curb population outflows 控制人口外流 focused on the agents recruiting people to emigrate. Countries passed laws against recruiters 招募者 after 1850 and brought some of them to trial 审判 as illegal traffickers 非法贩卖者 of women and children. And British reformers 改革者 even got legislation 立法 passed to check that Chinese and Indians entering into indentured contracts 契约合同 were not being enslaved 奴役 by those contracts. +

Across Europe, these agents were often stereotyped as 被刻板地视为 being Jewish, and the Christian migrants were seen as their innocent victims 无辜受害者. And because women might be drawn into prostitution 卖淫, the supposed criminal activity 犯罪行为 of agents was another reason for chivalrous men 有骑士精神的男人 to remove not just women's rights but their mobility 行动自由. +

And so you see here how two marginalized communities 边缘化群体 become more marginalized by systems of power 权力体系. +

All that noted, officials tended to allow those deemed inferior 被认为低等的 in one way or another to leave, often even encouraging their departure. For instance, the Jewish Colonisation Association 犹太殖民协会, formed in 1891, was allowed to recruit 招募 across Russia as the Empire implemented 实施 more policies for ethnic purity 种族纯洁. +

How these immigrant voyagers 移民旅行者 fared 经历 varied widely. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. +

For most, the voyage 航行 out of Europe was grueling 艰苦的, even death-defying 不顾生死的, as border guards 边防警卫 and travel personnel 工作人员 often stripped them of 剥夺 their already meager possessions 微薄的财物. Others experienced additional trauma 创伤, especially when epidemics 流行病 broke out 爆发. +

As Jews, like the Irish, were increasingly labeled as 被贴上…标签 slovenly 邋遢的 or germ-ridden 满是病菌的, officials administered 施行 shock remedies 休克疗法. In her autobiography 自传, Mary Antin, a Jewish migrant from Belarus 白俄罗斯 to the United States late in the 19th century, remembered being herded like animals 像动物一样被驱赶, forced to remove her clothing, then a slippery substance 滑腻的物质 that might be any bad thing rubbed on her body, ending with the steam of the shower blinding us. +

The treatment was a sanitary effort 卫生措施, but the way it was administered felt cruel 残忍的 and dehumanizing 有辱人格的. +

Others experienced the end of the journey as traumatic 痛苦的. Although the time it took to cross oceans had dramatically declined 大幅减少 because of steamships 蒸汽船, arriving in a big and unfamiliar coastal city 沿海城市 could be profoundly disorienting 令人极度迷失方向的. +

People who'd been accustomed to 习惯于 a rural pace of life 乡村生活节奏 were now searching for arduous 艰苦的, low-level work 低层次工作 where they could be expected to work 10 or more hours per day, six or seven days per week. +

Those left behind were also affected by emigration. "Dear husband, Teofila Brickowski of Warsaw, Poland," wrote in 1893 to her husband in the United States, "I don't know what to do. From longing 思念 and regret 悔恨, I comfort myself only that you won't forget me." +

Teofila, living in poverty 贫困 and shunned by 被…避开 her neighbors, never again heard from her husband. +

Thanks, Thought Bubble. +

I guess after centuries of serfdom 农奴制 and slavery, movement itself was sold as pure freedom, despite its paradoxes 矛盾 and complexity 复杂. To move from rural areas to urban spaces 城市空间 or from one nation to another or one continent to another did constitute 构成 a form of liberty 自由 -- and one that had not been available to most of those 40 million emigrants' ancestors. +

But the propaganda campaign 宣传活动 that encouraged movement also targeted 针对 certain classes of people as undesirable 不受欢迎的 to have in a community. Those suffering from pogroms or famines 饥荒 were being further marginalized 边缘化 and often blamed for 因…被指责 their own suffering and for any other suffering in the community. +

The Irish were accused of being "famous everywhere for their indolence 懒惰" and criticized for their "cunning 狡猾的, brutalized features 残忍的特征." They had themselves to thank for their poverty. +

Mary Antin, meanwhile, recalled 回忆 being spit on 被吐口水 by non-Jewish children as well as enduring 忍受 the pogroms that often began with the cry of "the crosses and the priests and the mob" passing through her neighborhood. +

As it turns out 结果是, migration for many was coercive 强制的, dangerous, and even lethal 致命的. For others, it was an escape from poverty and deprivation 贫困. +

One Swedish emigrant, perhaps remembering his meager fare 粗茶淡饭 of brown bread and herring, celebrated his move to the United States by saying, "God saved me from all that is Swedish" -- except for the herring, one hopes. +

But that perspective 观点 certainly wasn't universal 普遍的. Once again, how history looks depends upon where you are sitting. +

Thanks for watching. We'll see you next time. +

Crash Course is filmed here in the Jaden Smith Studios in Indianapolis. Thank you to Jaden Smith and indeed all of our patrons 赞助者 at patreon.com/crashcourse. We've got lots about the Crash Courses, including one about artificial intelligence 人工智能 that is absolutely fascinating. +

Thanks again for watching, and as they say in my hometown, don't forget to be awesome. +

大家好，我是约翰·格林，这里是《速成欧洲史》。 +

在1840年至1914年间，有多达4000万人离开了欧洲，这令人惊讶。这是人类历史上规模最大的移民潮之一，可能看起来有点奇怪，因为毕竟当时欧洲在技术和其他创新方面处于领先地位。 +

农业蓬勃发展。铁路在欧洲大陆上形成了越来越密集的网络，使货物运输更加高效，也让人们之间的联系更加紧密。那么，为什么会有人想要离开这个世界上最繁荣的地区呢，更不用说这多达4000万人了？ +

一方面，在许多欧洲社会，人们可以迁徙的观念是新出现的。农民在法律上不再像过去那样被强制要求在祖先耕种的土地上劳作。但同时，欧洲的繁荣并非普遍存在，甚至没有广泛地惠及大众。所以，虽然国家变得比以往任何时候都更加富有，但这些国家的许多人却没有享受到这种繁荣。 +

变化越多，就越有意思，而我接下来要谈到一些政治方面的内容了。 +

[音乐] +

好的，在这4000万移民中，有三分之一来自英国（United Kingdom），这有点令人惊讶，因为英国当时正成为一个全球性的强国，或许还是欧洲最繁荣的国家。但你要记住，当时整个爱尔兰（Ireland）都是英国的一部分，在 “饥饿的四十年代”（Hungry 40s），大约有125万爱尔兰人为了避免饥饿而移民——这是一个很好的例子，说明不平等往往与繁荣并存。 +

然后从1850年到1914年，爱尔兰人以每年6.5万人的速度移民——又有超过200万人离开了。其中有我的两位曾祖父。爱尔兰人的这种散居现象，从奥地利（Austria）到印度（India）都有，爱尔兰流亡作家詹姆斯·乔伊斯（James Joyce）的小说《尤利西斯》（*Ulysses*）中有一段著名的描述总结了这一现象，书中人物布鲁姆（Bloom）说：“一个国家就是生活在同一个地方的同一群人。” 然后过了一会儿又补充道：“或者是生活在不同地方的同一群人。” +

西半球（Western Hemisphere）是这些新移民的常见目的地，澳大利亚（Australia）和新西兰（New Zealand）也是如此。最早一批移民到澳大利亚的英国人是罪犯，但后来英国政府将澳大利亚和新西兰的大片土地提供给了富有的企业家——这些土地被认为是无人占用的，尽管事实上，它们是原住民（Aboriginal people）的传统土地。 +

人们迁徙也是为了寻找工作机会，尤其是在奴隶制（slavery）被废除后，世界各地的项目都需要劳动力。以欧洲为基地的企业家和殖民种植园主（colonial plantation owners）雇佣代理人，专门到印度和中国去寻找签订契约的工人——也就是说，通过书面合同让这些工人为某个项目工作。 +

他们会哄骗工人，并且经常在工作条件和合同期限上撒谎。例如，女性常常被承诺会在英国家庭中做保姆，但后来却发现自己被送到了加勒比地区（Caribbean）或南太平洋（South Pacific）的种植园，甚至是妓院。同样地，代理人操纵着斯堪的纳维亚（Scandinavia）和东欧（Eastern Europe）的人们，向他们承诺美好的未来，说服他们移民，尤其是在1873年全球经济衰退之后。 +

由于有了冷藏技术和更加全球化的肉类市场，食品和牲畜的价格正在下降。一些地区的村庄遭到了严重破坏，尤其是在像斯堪的纳维亚这样生长季节较短的地方。随着食品价格下降，土地能够养活的农民也越来越少。 +

在1886年至1900年间，超过10%的瑞典人（Swedes）移民了。许多人去了北美（North America），这就是为什么明尼苏达州（Minnesota）的腌鲱鱼那么好吃。这些移民的经历各不相同。在某些情况下，他们建立起了强大而繁荣的社区。而在另一些情况下，他们则生活得非常艰难。 +

最终，移民在瑞典确实失去了吸引力，部分原因是很多人已经离开了，这意味着留下来的人有了更多的工作机会；部分原因是水电能源为国家财富带来了许多新的工作岗位。可再生能源——它既是未来，也是过去。 +

在其他情况下，移民会跟随他们自己的家族或村庄网络前往新的土地。例如，西西里人（Sicilian）移民到北美的情况通常就是这样。长期以来，西西里的树木被砍伐用于希腊（Greek）的航运业，当地人还面临着来自一个由北方制造商和金融家主导的新国家政府的税收压力。 +

西西里的男性以及一些女性，有的独自，有的带着家人移民，许多人去了北美的城镇和村庄，在那里从事各种各样的工作。相当一部分人在挣到足够的钱后就回国开了一家商店，或者资助家庭成员的生意。在男性亲属离开后留下来的女性形成了一个个群体，也就是所谓的 “穿白衣的寡妇” 群体，她们等待着家人寄钱回家，或者等待亲人归来。 +

所以在1870年至1890年间，欧洲的大多数移民来自繁荣而强大的国家——47%来自英国，另有18%来自德国（Germany）。但在1890年至第一次世界大战（World War I）期间，其他地区开始占主导地位。数百万人离开了奥匈帝国（Austria-Hungary）和俄罗斯帝国（Russian Empire）。 +

一位观察家描述当时的情景时写道：“在1907年，整个团的人都为了去美国挣钱而离开了。许多房子空着，还有许多房子里只剩下了老年妇女和小孩。在一些村庄，整个年轻一代都离开了家。每个人都相信美国是应许之地，一个真正的天堂。” +

啊，美国，那个街道铺满奶酪的地方。难道只有我记得电影《美国鼠谭》（*An American Tail*）吗？可能吧。真的是只有我记得。 +

世界的中心刚刚打开了吗？是不是有一面美国国旗卡在了健怡胡椒博士汽水（Diet Dr. Pepper）的大炮里？在这儿呢。我有点担心这样展示国旗可能违反了相关规定，我表示歉意。我们没有别的东西了。 +

如果你看了很多《速成课程》，你就会经常看到这面美国国旗，但你知道吗，它可不是一面普通的美国国旗？这是我们的朋友兼同事马克（Mark）成为美国公民时被赠予的美国国旗。我们的办公室，就像美国的许多办公室一样，因为移民而变得更加强大。这可不应该是一个政治声明。 +

在俄罗斯帝国，许多人离开了，尤其是犹太人（Jews）。几个世纪以来，基督徒（Christians）以 “大屠杀”（pogroms）的形式袭击犹太人和他们的财产。在1881年沙皇亚历山大二世（Tsar Alexander II）被政治激进分子暗杀后，俄罗斯人发起了更多的大屠杀。 +

政府曾试图通过一项名为 “俄罗斯化”（Russification）的计划来整合这个由一百多个不同民族组成的庞大帝国。但当这个计划没有达到他们的预期效果时，政府转向了 “消极整合”，诋毁非俄罗斯的民族和宗教群体，驱逐或限制其中一些群体。犹太人是这些群体中首当其冲的。 +

有一项恶意诋毁的行为非常突出。内政部（Ministry of the Interior）警察部门的官员编造了一份虚假的文件，名为《锡安长老议定书》（*The Protocols of the Elders of Zion*）。它记录了一个完全由这些俄罗斯官员编造的犹太人阴谋，即犹太人企图接管世界。这份伪造的文件向我们展示了人们是多么坚决地要诋毁犹太人，以便对他们进行迫害、驱逐，甚至杀害。 +

事实上，《锡安长老议定书》在欧洲和世界各地传播，带来了越来越灾难性的后果。即使在今天，它也常常引发反犹主义（anti-Semitic）的阴谋论。 +

在这种大屠杀和迫害不断升级的氛围中，乌克兰人（Ukrainians）、立陶宛人（Lithuanians）、波兰人（Poles）和其他一些人在20世纪初逃离了俄罗斯帝国。其中有数以万计的犹太人。相比之下，非犹太裔的俄罗斯族人则被禁止离开。 +

所以，就像在爱尔兰一样，从俄罗斯帝国的移民具有民族、宗教和阶级层面的因素，而这些因素是由政府及其代理人推动的。 +

在匈牙利（Hungary），代理人寻找克罗地亚人（Croatians）、乌克兰人以及其他民族——通常是社会中最贫穷的人——让他们签订参与国外项目的合同。这是匈牙利试图使匈牙利社会 “马扎尔化”（Magyarize）的一部分——也就是说，让人口在文化上更加匈牙利化。 +

在奥匈帝国，一些官员鼓励移民，但另一些官员则反对移民，而且每个反对群体都有自己的理由。军事规划者看到村庄里潜在的新兵都离开了。民族主义者希望自己民族的人不要离开他们的社区。而大地主们常常发现，廉价的当地劳动力已经逃到了有更好工作的地方。 +

1903年，政府颁布法令，禁止匈牙利男性移民，尽管存在一些漏洞使得这条严厉的法律从未得到完全执行。奥地利（Austria）尤其试图遏制移民，但收效甚微。弗朗茨·约瑟夫皇帝（Emperor Francis Joseph）甚至赞助了一个项目，试图让移民回国。 +

其他遏制人口外流的努力则集中在招募移民的代理人身上。1850年以后，各国通过了针对招募者的法律，并将其中一些人作为非法贩卖妇女和儿童的人送上了法庭。英国的改革者甚至推动通过了一项立法，以确保签订契约的中国人和印度人不会因为这些契约而被奴役。 +

在整个欧洲，这些代理人常常被刻板地认为是犹太人，而基督教徒移民则被视为他们无辜的受害者。而且因为女性可能会被诱骗进入卖淫行业，这些代理人所谓的犯罪行为成为了那些 “有骑士精神” 的男性剥夺女性权利，甚至限制她们行动自由的另一个理由。 +

所以你可以看到，两个被边缘化的群体是如何因权力体系而变得更加边缘化的。 +

尽管如此，官员们往往允许那些在某种程度上被认为低人一等的人离开，甚至常常鼓励他们离开。例如，成立于1891年的犹太殖民协会（Jewish Colonisation Association）在俄罗斯帝国实施更多的种族纯洁政策时，被允许在俄罗斯各地招募人员。 +

这些移民在旅途中的遭遇千差万别。让我们进入“思想泡泡”环节。 +

对大多数人来说，离开欧洲的旅程非常艰苦，甚至充满生命危险，因为边境警卫和旅行工作人员常常会抢走他们本就微薄的财物。其他人还经历了更多的创伤，尤其是在流行病爆发的时候。 +

由于犹太人像爱尔兰人一样，越来越被贴上邋遢或携带病菌的标签，官员们采取了一些极端的措施。玛丽·安廷（Mary Antin）是19世纪后期从白俄罗斯（Belarus）移民到美国的一名犹太人，她在自传中回忆道，自己像动物一样被驱赶，被迫脱掉衣服，然后一种可能是任何不好东西的滑腻物质被涂在她的身上，最后是淋浴的蒸汽让他们什么都看不见。 +

这种处理方式本意是为了卫生，但实施的方式却让人感到残酷和丧失人性。 +

其他人在旅程结束时也经历了创伤。尽管由于轮船的出现，穿越大洋所需的时间大幅缩短，但到达一个陌生的大型沿海城市可能会让人极度迷失方向。 +

那些习惯了乡村生活节奏的人，现在要寻找艰苦的低层次工作，在这些工作中，他们可能每天要工作10个小时甚至更多，每周工作6到7天。 +

留下来的人也受到了移民的影响。1893年，波兰华沙（Warsaw, Poland）的特奥菲拉·布里克沃夫斯卡（Teofila Brickowski）给她在美国的丈夫写道：“我不知道该怎么办。因为思念和悔恨，我只能安慰自己，你不会忘记我。” +

生活贫困且被邻居们冷落的特奥菲拉，再也没有收到过她丈夫的消息。 +

感谢“思想泡泡”！ +

我想，在经历了几个世纪的农奴制（serfdom）和奴隶制之后，迁徙本身被宣传为纯粹的自由，尽管它存在着矛盾和复杂性。从农村地区迁移到城市，或者从一个国家迁移到另一个国家，或者从一个大陆迁移到另一个大陆，确实构成了一种自由形式——而且是那4000万移民中的大多数人的祖先所不曾拥有的自由。 +

但是，鼓励迁徙的宣传活动也将某些阶层的人视为社区中不受欢迎的对象。那些遭受大屠杀或饥荒的人被进一步边缘化，并且常常因为自己的苦难以及社区中的其他苦难而受到指责。 +

爱尔兰人被指责 “因懒惰而闻名于世”，并因其 “狡猾、野蛮的特征” 而受到批评。他们的贫穷被认为是他们自己的错。 +

与此同时，玛丽·安廷回忆起自己曾被非犹太孩子吐口水，还经历了大屠杀，这些大屠杀常常以 “十字架、牧师和暴民” 的呼喊声穿过她的社区为开端。 +

事实证明，对许多人来说，移民是被迫的、危险的，甚至是致命的。而对另一些人来说，它是摆脱贫困和匮乏的一种途径。 +

一位瑞典移民，也许是想起了自己曾经只能吃黑面包和鲱鱼的简陋饮食，在庆祝自己移民到美国时说：“上帝把我从所有瑞典的东西中拯救了出来”——希望除了鲱鱼。 +

但这种观点当然并不普遍。再一次，历史的面貌取决于你所处的立场。 +

感谢观看。我们下次再见。 +

《速成课程》是在印第安纳波利斯（Indianapolis）的贾登·史密斯工作室（Jaden Smith Studios）拍摄的。感谢贾登·史密斯（Jaden Smith），以及我们在patreon.com/crashcourse上的所有赞助者。我们有很多关于《速成课程》的内容，包括一个关于人工智能的课程，绝对非常有趣。 +

再次感谢观看，就像我家乡的人说的，别忘了要活得精彩。 +

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

So between 1840 and 1914, an astonishing 40 million people left Europe. It was one of the greatest migrations in human history, and it might seem a little odd because, like, after all, Europe was leading in technological and other innovations at the time.

Agriculture was thriving. Railroads were creating an increasingly dense network across the continent to move goods more efficiently and connect people to each other. So why would anyone, let alone 40 million people, want to leave the most prosperous region in the world?

Well, for one thing, in many European communities, the idea that people could move was new. Peasants were less likely to be legally required to work the land their ancestors had worked. But also, Europe's prosperity was not universal or even widely shared. And so while nations became richer than ever before, many of the people in those nations were left out of that prosperity.

The more things change, roll the interest, and I'm about to get political.

[Music]

Okay, so one-third of those 40 million emigrants were from the United Kingdom, which is surprising because the UK was becoming a global world power and perhaps the most prosperous European nation. But you have to remember that at the time, all of Ireland was part of the UK, and in the Hungry 40s, some 1.25 million Irish people migrated to avoid starvation -- a good example that inequality often coexists with prosperity.

Then from 1850 until 1914, Irish people migrated at a rate of 65,000 per year -- more than two million additional people. Among them were two of my great-grandfathers. This Irish diaspora, which stretched from Austria to India, was summarized famously in Irish expat James Joyce's novel *Ulysses* when the character Bloom says, "A nation is the same people living in the same place," and then a moment later adds, "or in different places."

The Western Hemisphere was a common destination for these new migrants, as were Australia and New Zealand. The first British immigrants to Australia were convicts, but later the British government offered large tracts of land in Australia and New Zealand to wealthy entrepreneurs -- land that was seen as available, although in fact, it was the traditional land of Aboriginal people.

People also moved in search of work opportunities, especially because projects around the world needed laborers once slavery was abolished. European-based entrepreneurs and colonial plantation owners used agents to comb India and China, in particular, to find workers to indenture -- that is, to bind to a project through a written contract.

They would cajole and routinely lie about working conditions and the lengths of these contracts. Women, for instance, were often promised jobs as nursemaids in English households and then found themselves shipped to plantations in the Caribbean or the South Pacific or even to brothels. Similarly, agents manipulated people in Scandinavia and Eastern Europe, promising them a golden future and convincing them to emigrate, especially after the global economic downturn of 1873.

Thanks to refrigeration and a more global market for meat, prices for food and livestock were declining. Villages in some areas were decimated, especially in places with shorter growing seasons like Scandinavia. Soil, too, was supporting fewer and fewer farmers as food prices declined.

Between 1886 and 1900, more than 10% of all Swedes emigrated. Many went to North America, which is why the pickled herring is so good in Minnesota. The experience of these emigrants was mixed. In some cases, they built strong and prosperous communities. In others, they struggled mightily.

Eventually, migration did lose its luster in Sweden, in part because, you know, lots of people had left, which meant there were more work opportunities for the people who remained, and in part because hydroelectric energy yielded lots of new jobs in national wealth. Renewable energy -- it's the future and the past.

In other cases, migrants followed their own family or village networks to new lands. This is how, for instance, Sicilian emigration to North America often worked. Sicily had long been denuded of its trees for Greek shipping, and locals were facing taxation from a new national government that was dominated by manufacturers and financiers in the north.

Sicilian men and some women migrated, whether alone or with family, many to North American towns and villages where they worked a variety of jobs. A good number returned home after earning enough to set up a store or finance a family member's business. And the women who remained after their male relatives left created clusters and communities of so-called "widows in white," waiting for funds to be sent home or for their relatives to return.

So between 1870 and 1890, most of Europe's emigrants were from prosperous and powerful countries -- 47% came from Britain, another 18% from Germany. But between 1890 and World War I, other regions began to dominate. Millions left Austria-Hungary and the Russian Empire.

"Entire regiments left in 1907 in order to earn money in America," wrote one observer of the scene. "Many houses stood empty, and in many others, only old women and small children remained behind. In some villages, the entire young generation left home. Everyone believed that America was the promised land, a true paradise."

Ah, America, where the streets are paved with cheese. Am I the only person who remembers the movie *An American Tail*? Possibly. Literally, yes.

Did the center of the world just open? Is there an American flag stuck inside of a Diet Dr. Pepper cannon? There. I'm a little worried this might be against the rules of how you're supposed to display the flag, and I apologize. We didn't have anything else.

If you've watched a lot of Crash Course, you've seen a lot of this American flag, but did you know that it is not just any American flag? It is the American flag that our friend and colleague Mark was given when he became an American. Our office, like so many offices in the United States, has been tremendously strengthened by immigration. And that shouldn't be a political statement.

In the Russian Empire, many people left, but especially Jews. Christians had assaulted Jews and their property for generations in acts called pogroms. And after the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881 by political radicals, Russians launched more pogroms.

The government had tried integrating their vast empire, composed of more than a hundred different ethnic groups, with a program called Russification. But when that did not work to its satisfaction, the government changed course toward negative integration, vilifying non-Russian ethnic and religious groups, expelling or restricting several of them. Jews were foremost among those groups.

One active vilification really stands out. Officials in the police department of the Ministry of the Interior produced a phony account called *The Protocols of the Elders of Zion*. It documented a Jewish plot -- entirely concocted by these Russian officials -- for a Jewish takeover of the world. And that forgery shows us just how determined people were to demonize Jews so that they could be persecuted, expelled, and even killed.

In fact, *The Protocols* spread across Europe and the world with increasingly disastrous results. And even today, it often fuels anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.

And in this atmosphere of escalating pogroms and persecution, Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Poles, and others fled the Russian Empire at the turn of the 20th century. Among them, tens of thousands of Jewish people. In contrast, non-Jewish ethnic Russians were forbidden to leave.

So, as in Ireland, migration from the Russian Empire had an ethnic, religious, and class dimension that was fostered by governments and their agents.

In Hungary, agents searched out Croatians, Ukrainians, and other ethnicities -- often the poorest in society -- to sign up for foreign ventures. This was part of Hungary's attempt to Magyarize Hungarian society -- that is, make the population more culturally Hungarian.

In Austria-Hungary, some officials promoted migration, but others were opposed to it, and each group of opponents had their own reasons. Military planners saw villages emptied of potential recruits. Nationalists wanted people of their own ethnicity blocked from leaving their communities. And large landowners often found that cheap local labor had fled to places where there were better jobs.

In 1903, the government decreed that Hungarian men would not be allowed to emigrate, although loopholes kept this draconian law from ever being fully effective. Austria had especially attempted to curb emigration without much luck. Emperor Francis Joseph even sponsored a project to try to get emigrants to return.

Other efforts to curb population outflows focused on the agents recruiting people to emigrate. Countries passed laws against recruiters after 1850 and brought some of them to trial as illegal traffickers of women and children. And British reformers even got legislation passed to check that Chinese and Indians entering into indentured contracts were not being enslaved by those contracts.

Across Europe, these agents were often stereotyped as being Jewish, and the Christian migrants were seen as their innocent victims. And because women might be drawn into prostitution, the supposed criminal activity of agents was another reason for chivalrous men to remove not just women's rights but their mobility.

And so you see here how two marginalized communities become more marginalized by systems of power.

All that noted, officials tended to allow those deemed inferior in one way or another to leave, often even encouraging their departure. For instance, the Jewish Colonisation Association, formed in 1891, was allowed to recruit across Russia as the Empire implemented more policies for ethnic purity.

How these immigrant voyagers fared varied widely. Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

For most, the voyage out of Europe was grueling, even death-defying, as border guards and travel personnel often stripped them of their already meager possessions. Others experienced additional trauma, especially when epidemics broke out.

As Jews, like the Irish, were increasingly labeled as slovenly or germ-ridden, officials administered shock remedies. In her autobiography, Mary Antin, a Jewish migrant from Belarus to the United States late in the 19th century, remembered being herded like animals, forced to remove her clothing, then a slippery substance that might be any bad thing rubbed on her body, ending with the steam of the shower blinding us.

The treatment was a sanitary effort, but the way it was administered felt cruel and dehumanizing.

Others experienced the end of the journey as traumatic. Although the time it took to cross oceans had dramatically declined because of steamships, arriving in a big and unfamiliar coastal city could be profoundly disorienting.

People who'd been accustomed to a rural pace of life were now searching for arduous, low-level work where they could be expected to work 10 or more hours per day, six or seven days per week.

Those left behind were also affected by emigration. "Dear husband, Teofila Brickowski of Warsaw, Poland," wrote in 1893 to her husband in the United States, "I don't know what to do. From longing and regret, I comfort myself only that you won't forget me."

Teofila, living in poverty and shunned by her neighbors, never again heard from her husband.

Thanks, Thought Bubble.

I guess after centuries of serfdom and slavery, movement itself was sold as pure freedom, despite its paradoxes and complexity. To move from rural areas to urban spaces or from one nation to another or one continent to another did constitute a form of liberty -- and one that had not been available to most of those 40 million emigrants' ancestors.

But the propaganda campaign that encouraged movement also targeted certain classes of people as undesirable to have in a community. Those suffering from pogroms or famines were being further marginalized and often blamed for their own suffering and for any other suffering in the community.

The Irish were accused of being "famous everywhere for their indolence" and criticized for their "cunning, brutalized features." They had themselves to thank for their poverty.

Mary Antin, meanwhile, recalled being spit on by non-Jewish children as well as enduring the pogroms that often began with the cry of "the crosses and the priests and the mob" passing through her neighborhood.

As it turns out, migration for many was coercive, dangerous, and even lethal. For others, it was an escape from poverty and deprivation.

One Swedish emigrant, perhaps remembering his meager fare of brown bread and herring, celebrated his move to the United States by saying, "God saved me from all that is Swedish" -- except for the herring, one hopes.

But that perspective certainly wasn't universal. Once again, how history looks depends upon where you are sitting.

Thanks for watching. We'll see you next time.

Crash Course is filmed here in the Jaden Smith Studios in Indianapolis. Thank you to Jaden Smith and indeed all of our patrons at patreon.com/crashcourse. We've got lots about the Crash Courses, including one about artificial intelligence that is absolutely fascinating.

Thanks again for watching, and as they say in my hometown, don't forget to be awesome.
