Hi, I'm John Green 约翰·格林, and this is Crash Course European History 欧洲历史速成课. +

So, the twentieth century opened with feminists 女权主义者 smashing 打碎；捣烂 store windows. The Irish were contesting 质疑；反对 British rule 英国统治; Russians were challenging 挑战 royal rule 君主统治 in the Revolution of 1905 1905年革命. The French were fighting within families and across society over the plight 困境；苦难 of Jewish colonel 上校 Alfred Dreyfus 阿尔弗雷德·德雷福斯, who'd been convicted of 被判定犯有 espionage 间谍罪 on the basis of 根据 fabricated 伪造的 evidence 证据. +

And over the past few decades, anarchists 无政府主义者 had been assassinating 暗杀 heads of state 国家元首 and members of powerful families 权贵家族成员, including the empress 皇后 of Austria-Hungary 奥匈帝国. And we'll talk more about all these upheavals 动荡；剧变, and the ways they helped shape twentieth century Europe, but today we want to turn to the arts, and sciences, and philosophical thought 哲学思想 -- all of which both shaped and were shaped by the big political and social events of the day. +

We often use terms like "art history 艺术史" and "history of science 科学史" to separate out 分离；区分 scientific and artistic pursuits 科学和艺术追求 from political and social history, but if history is the story of how our species 物种 got to now, the histories of art and philosophy and science are essential to 对…必不可少, and inseparable from 与…不可分割, human history. +

[Intro] +

Music, art, and dance had traditionally featured 以…为特色 hummable 顺口的；易记的 and moving 感人的 tunes 曲调, realistic 写实的 depictions 描绘 of graceful 优雅的 women and noble 高贵的 men, and the fluttering 飘动的 arms of waiflike 像流浪儿般的 ballerinas 芭蕾舞女演员 moving ethereally 飘逸地 across the stage. By 1900, all that had changed with what is now called modern classical music 现代古典音乐, modern art 现代艺术, and modern dance 现代舞. +

The term "modernism 现代主义" applies to 适用于 the rejection 摒弃；拒绝 or radical 彻底的；激进的 alteration 改变 of all that had come before in the arts and in thought. Some people see modernism as a rejection of the Enlightenment 启蒙运动's rational 理性的 approach to reality, but others believe that aspects of modernism such as abstraction 抽象概念 demand 需要 a higher level of rationality 理性. +

That is, one has to use higher levels of thought in dealing with the abstract forms 抽象形式 than concrete 具体的 ones -- the idea of a number, for example, is more complicated 复杂的 and more interesting than counting 数数. +

But for contemporary 当代的 audiences and critics 评论家, modern music sounded like screeching 发出尖锐刺耳的声音 and scratching 发出刮擦声. Song gave way 让路；让步, in critics' views, to noise, even in modern dance. The ballet dancers in Rite of Spring 春之祭 made jerking 急促而不连贯的 movements and pounded 猛击；重击 the floor in so-called 所谓的 primitive 原始的 rather than graceful 优雅的 ways. Ballerinas removed their tutus 芭蕾舞裙 and ballet-toe slippers 芭蕾舞鞋 and danced in bare feet 赤脚 and tunics 束腰外衣. +

Choreographers 编舞家 and performers 表演者 claimed to create these new movements by imitating 模仿 foreign dancers seen at world fairs 世界博览会 and in distant lands 遥远的地方. And similarly 同样地, composers 作曲家 copied instrumentation 乐器演奏法 and musical forms 音乐形式 from Japan, Bali 巴厘岛, South Asia 南亚, and other regions. +

Audiences literally 确实地 howled 怒吼 and walked out of these performances, but the world of dance and music had changed forever. +

As for visual art 视觉艺术: By becoming "modern," artists changed their style almost yearly 每年, or at least so it seemed to some observers. "Make it new" was their motto 座右铭, and the impressionists 印象派画家 broke with 打破 realism 写实主义 in their paintings first by having human figures 人物形象 appear to float 漂浮, without a stable 稳定的 background and without creating exact likenesses 相似之处 of faces, as you see in the paintings of Édouard Manet 爱德华·马奈. +

And then Claude Monet 克劳德·莫奈 and his followers 追随者 produced images of train stations and other urban 城市的 buildings that shimmered 闪烁；发微光 with flecks 斑点 and dabs 小块 of color instead of clear lines 清晰的线条 and realistic shading 写实的阴影. They were trying to project 传达；表达 the Japanese belief in mono no aware 物哀 -- the fleetingness 短暂；无常 of life. +

Indistinct 模糊的 colors and lines gave the "impression 印象" of nature's constantly changing appearance instead of stabilizing 使稳定；使固定 it in "realism," which, as the impressionists pointed out, wasn't really real, because the real is always changing, while "realism" portrays 描绘 static 静态的 images. +

But as with the changes in music, it appeared to outsiders that artists were losing their grip on 失去对…的控制 reality and their skill in minutely 细致地 depicting 描绘 the world. +

Artists also increasingly focused on 专注于 industrial 工业的, urban 城市的, and working-class 工人阶级的 life instead of presenting aristocratic 贵族的 privilege 特权. Leisured 悠闲的 patrons 赞助人 were replaced by workers in parks, women doing laundry and ironing 熨烫衣物, fatigued 疲惫的 day laborers 日工, and the destitute 穷人. +

German artist Käthe Kollwitz 凯绥·珂勒惠支 angered 激怒 the aristocratic upper classes 贵族上层阶级 by emphasizing 强调 the frailty 脆弱 and suffering 苦难 of the poor instead of showing the nobility 高贵 of the prosperous 富裕的 few. The German Kaiser 德国皇帝 called her woodcuts 木刻作品 "gutter art 低俗艺术". +

But by this time, artists were earning their livelihoods 谋生 from public commissions 公共委托 and a new class of art dealers 艺术经销商, not only from rich elites 富有的精英 commissioning 委托制作 portraits of themselves posing with pineapples 菠萝. +

Another reminder that what artists end up painting has a lot to do with 与…有很大关系 who ends up buying their paint. +

Many artists only scraped by 勉强维持生计 -- 19th-century artists like Vincent van Gogh 文森特·梵高 helped give us our contemporary 当代的 idea of the starving 挨饿的 and tortured 备受折磨的 artist -- but others prospered 成功；兴旺 by working in commercially 商业上地 advantageous 有利的 styles like Art Nouveau 新艺术运动, which featured 以…为特色 curving 弯曲的 lines of vines 藤蔓 and other plant life, as well as romanticized 浪漫化的 women's bodies with long flowing hair 飘逸的长发. +

Artists designed many everyday objects 日常物品 in the Art Nouveau style 新艺术运动风格 as well, from cutlery 餐具 to combs 梳子. And commercial artists 商业艺术家 also produced full-color advertising posters 全彩广告海报 for steamship lines 轮船公司, and dance halls 舞厅, and cafés 咖啡馆, and theater performances 戏剧演出, and brands of soap 肥皂 and coffee. +

These posters were displayed on kiosks 报亭 and in other public spaces 公共场所, so Art Nouveau brightened 照亮；使更亮丽 everyday urban space 城市日常空间 and advanced 推进；促进 modern phenomena 现象 such as department stores 百货商店 and mass consumerism 大众消费主义 by being really effective advertising 有效的广告. +

And even today, posters of Art Nouveau advertisements 新艺术运动风格广告 can be found in like one-third of college dorm rooms 大学宿舍. Stan says that in his experience, it's closer to 65%, but to be fair 公平地说, neither of us has been in a dorm room in like twenty years. +

By the turn of the century 在世纪之交, changes in art became even more radical 激进的. Like, painter Paul Cézanne 保罗·塞尚 depicted 描绘 items like apples and oranges in geometric 几何的 terms. Bodily shapes 身体形状 and those in nature like mountains became planes 平面 and spheres 球体. +

Immediately following, Pablo Picasso 巴勃罗·毕加索 not only used geometric 几何的 splotches 色块 to portray 描绘 women but also depicted 描绘 their faces as African masks 非洲面具. In 1907, Swedish artist Hilma af Klint 希尔玛·阿夫·克林特 produced the first entirely abstract 抽象的 painting with no relationship whatsoever 丝毫；无论如何 to realistic forms 现实形态. +

And most of these artists, like the earlier impressionists, were deeply influenced by ideas and beliefs coming from the colonized world 殖民地世界 and other distant lands 遥远的地方. Many would argue they were also appropriating 挪用；剽窃 those ideas and beliefs in much the same way colonizers 殖民者 were extracting 提取；获取 other resources. +

But the impact of global ideas on European art was profound 深远的. For example, af Klint and Norwegian Edvard Munch 爱德华·蒙克 aimed to capture 捕捉 spiritual truths 精神真理 as preached 宣扬 in theosophy 通神论 -- a mixture 混合 of beliefs and practices taken from Buddhist 佛教的, Hindu 印度教的, Islamic 伊斯兰教的, and other philosophical 哲学的 and religious 宗教的 traditions 传统. +

They used colors with meanings that were laid out 阐述；说明 in theosophical teachings 通神论教义. And presenting these schemes 方案 correctly was supposed to portray 描绘 inner reality 内在现实. +

Munch's The Scream 呐喊 famously used line 线条 and color in ways that people believe to be emblematic of 象征 turn-of-the-century modernism 世纪之交的现代主义, especially the internal distress 内心痛苦 that many felt amid 在…之中 the faster pace 节奏 and tensions 紧张局势 of modern life. +

And there were similarly revolutionary 革命性的 ideas coming out of the world of science that would upend 颠覆 our understanding of the world. +

Let's go to the Thought Bubble 思考泡泡. +

In 1896, French physicist 物理学家 Antoine Becquerel 安托万·贝克勒尔 discovered radioactivity 放射性. +
He also suggested that elements 元素 were changeable 可变的 or mutable 可变的 through the rearrangement 重新排列 of their atoms 原子. +
And then, from the discoveries of Marie Curie 玛丽·居里 and her husband Pierre Curie 皮埃尔·居里, +
who found the more radioactive 放射性更强的 elements polonium 钋 and radium 镭, +
scientists determined 确定 that atoms 原子 are not solid 实心的. +
In 1900, German physicist Max Planck 马克斯·普朗克's quantum theory 量子理论 changed people's understanding of energy 能量, +
although like Galileo 伽利略 centuries earlier, his theories were not accepted at the time. +
And amid 在…之中 this revolutionary scientific universe 科学领域, physicist Albert Einstein 阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦 announced his special theory of relativity 狭义相对论 in 1905. +
According to 根据 this theory, space 空间 and time 时间 are not absolute 绝对的 categories 范畴 +
but instead vary 根据…变化 according to the vantage point 视角 of the observer 观察者. +
Only the speed of light 光速 is constant 恒定的. +
In 1915, Einstein published his general theory of relativity 广义相对论, +
which connected 联系 the force 力, or gravity 引力, of an object 物体 with its mass 质量 +
and proposed 提出 a fourth mathematical dimension 数学维度 to the universe 宇宙. +
And Einstein's theories of energy 能量理论 became critical to 对…至关重要 all kinds of technological innovation 技术创新, from television 电视 to the nuclear bomb 核弹. +
As discussed in detail in our History of Science series 科学史系列, the findings 发现 of Planck, Einstein, and others really created a "paradigm shift 范式转变" away from the Newtonian science 牛顿科学 of the early modern period 早期现代时期. +
And in many ways, we are still in the shadow of 在…的影响下 the tremendous 巨大的 discoveries at the turn of the century. +
Thanks, Thought Bubble. +

So, for a long time, scientists have made discoveries and produced theories that do not fit with 符合 common sense 常识, everyday interpretations 解释 of the physical world 物质世界. Right? +

Did the center of the world just open? Is there a compass 指南针 in there? This is a great example of what I mean. +

We still say that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, right? Because practically 实际上, for us, it does. Even though, you know, it doesn't. +

Slightly off topic 稍微跑题, but when I close my eyes and imagine the Earth from space, I always picture 想象 North being up, right? Like, Antarctica 南极洲 is at the bottom, the North Pole 北极 is at the top. But no! Why? +

So, inevitably 不可避免地, the way we need to represent 描绘 the world in an everyday way, in order to know when to turn left and when to turn right, is going to skew 歪曲；扭曲 our understanding of the world. +

And during this revolutionary time, just as thinkers were trying to understand the relationship between perceived reality 感知到的现实 and objective reality 客观现实, they were also trying to understand the mind 心灵, and the relationship between our interior selves 内心的自我 and the selves we project 表现出来的自我. +

Which brings us to Freud 弗洛伊德. +

Sigmund Freud 西格蒙德·弗洛伊德 questioned 质疑 the Enlightenment beliefs 启蒙运动的信念 in a rational self 理性的自我 wedded to 与…紧密相连 reasonable decision-making 合理决策 and self-interest 利己主义. Because, you know, we are not rational selves wedded to reasonable decision-making and self-interest. +

Instead of a unified 统一的, rational 理性的 persona 人格, Freud claimed that the human self or psyche 心理 contains 包含 three parts struggling against one another 相互斗争 for dominance 主导地位: the ego 自我, the part centered on 以…为中心 realistic activity 现实活动 to survive 生存; the id (or libido 力比多), the part alive with 充满 sexual energies 性能量 pushing instinctual 本能的 rather than rational behavior 理性行为; and the superego 超我, the part that acts as 充当 the conscience 良知. +

Freud developed the practice of psychoanalysis 精神分析疗法 to treat the person in whom these three elements 要素 were out of balance 失衡 enough to cause mental disturbances 精神障碍 or neuroses 神经症. +

Psychoanalysis involved 涉及 a "talking cure 谈话疗法" in which the patient tried to call forth 唤起 repressed 被压抑的 fantasies 幻想, and fears 恐惧, and desires 欲望 so that they might be understood and cured. +

An especially controversial 有争议的 part of Freud's theories stated that sexual life 性生活 should be evaluated 评估 scientifically 科学地 without religious or moral judgments 判断. According to 根据 him, from infancy 婴儿期 on, children had sexual drives 性欲. And in order for civilization 文明 to exist 存在, these drives -- most notably 尤其；特别 in the case of Freudian psychology 弗洛伊德心理学, the drive toward incest 乱伦的欲望 -- needed to be controlled 控制. +

He also insisted 坚持认为 that gender identity 性别认同 was not a straightforward 简单直接的 entity 实体 but instead complicated 复杂的 and that women, like men, had strong sexual feelings 性欲; they weren't passionless 没有激情的, as advocates 倡导者 of domesticity 家庭生活 maintained 坚持认为. +

Although many of Freud's ideas have been abandoned 摒弃, the influence of psychoanalysis extends to this day 至今仍然存在. In fact 事实上, I am visiting my therapist 心理治疗师 later this afternoon. +

It's now more common to talk with counselors 心理咨询师 and therapists 心理治疗师 to bring our problems out in the open 公开讨论 instead of repressing 压抑 them. We also believe in the existence of neuroses 神经症 and that our selves are not composed entirely of 完全由…组成 rationality 理性 and intellectual activity 智力活动. +

Just like artists crushing 打破 traditional beliefs 传统观念, Freud advanced 推进 modernism by claiming that our old ideas about the mind itself 心灵本身 were outdated 过时的. +

Simultaneously 同时地, other theorists 理论家 rejected 拒绝 the idea that science and facts could be used to uncover 揭示 social laws 社会规律. The social sciences 社会科学 of sociology 社会学 and economics 经济学 -- to name just two 仅举两个例子 -- had developed around the pursuit of 追求 identifying 确定 enduring 持久的 laws of society. +

And the belief that you can discover social facts 社会事实 and basic social laws 基本社会规律 to guide 指导 public policy 公共政策 is called positivism 实证主义, and it was challenged 挑战 by those who held that there were too many facts to compute 计算 and that humans were complex 复杂的 and ever-changing 不断变化的 and at times 有时 somewhat irrational 不理性的 -- both when it came to economic choices 经济决策 and when it came to social ones 社会决策. +

I mean, how else do you explain the strange early 21st-century rise of the Croc 洞洞鞋? +

Those theorists called relativists 相对主义者 and pragmatists 实用主义者 have been in constant debate 持续争论 with positivists 实证主义者 right up until now, and if you think we're getting in the middle of that, you're wrong. +

Can we rationally 理性地 and with confidence 自信地 make infallible 绝对正确的 laws? Is a question I'm sure you'll be commenting upon 发表评论. +

Probably the most scandalous 有争议的 thinker of the time was the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche 弗里德里希·尼采, who denied the certainty of truth, insisting that all knowledge simply represents what humans -- from scientists to shopkeepers -- have perceived 感知；察觉. +

The human mind, for example, filters 过滤 what nature is and presents its own sense of nature's truth -- a human representation 表现；描述 of reality rather than reality itself. +

Nietzsche believed that absolute truths 绝对真理, including age-old 古老的 tenets 信条；原则 of religion, were in decline 衰落. "God is dead, we have killed him," he famously announced as the result of modern understandings of the universe. +

Humans could now embark on 开始；着手进行 the happy search for new "poetries of life" free from religious and other traditional rules. +

Nietzsche eventually contracted 感染 syphilis 梅毒 and became mentally ill 精神错乱, and his sister converted 转变；改变 the philosopher's disdain 蔑视；鄙视 for traditional values into attacks on Jews and support for nationalists 民族主义者, and anti-Semites 反犹主义者, and militarists 军国主义者 -- a reminder that the ideas of modernism were tools that could be wielded 运用；使用 in a variety of ways. +

Which we will see, with tragic consequences 悲剧性后果, throughout the twentieth century. +

And so the turn of the century was alive with 充满 fresh ideas 新思想, upending 颠覆 concepts from painting and dance to philosophy and physics. +

And we are living today in a world wrought by 受…影响 modern ideas, but also one that is experiencing its own period of profound 深刻的 disruptions 扰乱；破坏 in the ways we communicate and how we understand truth. +

And that makes me wonder how our revolutionary disruptions will seem a century from now. Will this time be remembered as one in which people grew closer together through tools of communication 通信工具? Or will it be remembered as one in which people grew increasingly further apart as polarization 两极分化 worsened 恶化? +

The answer to that is partly up to you, and the choices that you will make that will shape our shared future. +

Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time. +

大家好，我是约翰·格林（John Green），这里是《欧洲历史速成课》。 +

20世纪伊始，女权主义者就开始砸毁商店橱窗。爱尔兰人在反抗英国统治；1905年，俄罗斯人在革命中挑战君主统治。法国人则因犹太裔上校阿尔弗雷德·德雷福斯（Alfred Dreyfus）的困境，在家庭内部和整个社会引发了激烈争斗，德雷福斯被人凭借伪造的证据判定犯有间谍罪。 +

在过去几十年里，无政府主义者一直在暗杀国家元首和权贵家族成员，其中包括奥匈帝国的皇后。我们之后会详细探讨这些动荡事件，以及它们如何塑造了20世纪的欧洲，但今天我们想聊聊艺术、科学和哲学思想——这些领域既塑造了当时重大的政治和社会事件，也受到这些事件的影响。 +

我们经常使用“艺术史”和“科学史”这样的术语，将科学与艺术追求和政治、社会历史区分开来，但如果历史是关于人类如何走到今天的故事，那么艺术史、哲学史和科学史就是人类历史不可或缺的重要组成部分。 +

[简介] +

传统上，音乐、艺术和舞蹈的特点是旋律动听且感人，对优雅女性和高贵男性进行写实描绘，身材纤瘦的芭蕾舞者舞动着双臂，在舞台上轻盈飘逸地穿梭。到了1900年，随着如今被称为现代古典音乐、现代艺术和现代舞的出现，这一切都发生了改变。 +

“现代主义”一词指的是对艺术和思想领域中先前所有事物的摒弃或彻底变革。有些人认为现代主义是对启蒙运动看待现实的理性方式的否定，但也有人认为，现代主义中的抽象等元素需要更高层次的理性思维。 +

也就是说，在处理抽象形式时，人们需要运用比处理具体形式更高层次的思维——例如，数字的概念比数数更复杂、更有趣。 +

但对当代观众和评论家来说，现代音乐听起来就像刺耳的噪音和刮擦声。在评论家看来，歌曲已被噪音取代，就连现代舞也是如此。芭蕾舞剧《春之祭》中的舞者动作生硬，用所谓原始而非优雅的方式跺脚。芭蕾舞女演员们脱掉芭蕾舞裙和芭蕾舞鞋，赤脚穿着束腰外衣跳舞。 +

编舞家和舞者声称，他们是通过模仿在世界博览会和遥远地区看到的外国舞者，来创造这些新动作的。同样，作曲家借鉴了日本、巴厘岛、南亚和其他地区的乐器演奏方式和音乐形式。 +

观众们在演出时大声抗议，甚至直接离场，但舞蹈和音乐的世界从此发生了永久性的改变。 +

至于视觉艺术：通过走向“现代”，艺术家们几乎每年都会改变自己的风格，至少在一些观察者看来是这样。“推陈出新”是他们的座右铭，印象派画家率先在绘画中打破写实风格，他们笔下的人物仿佛漂浮着，没有稳定的背景，也没有精确描绘面部特征，就像在爱德华·马奈（Édouard Manet）的画作中看到的那样。 +

接着，克劳德·莫奈（Claude Monet）和他的追随者创作了火车站和其他城市建筑的画作，这些画作以斑驳的色彩呈现出闪烁的效果，而非清晰的线条和写实的阴影。他们试图传达日本人 “物哀” 的理念——生命的短暂无常。 +

模糊的色彩和线条给人一种自然不断变化的 “印象”，而不是像 “写实主义” 那样将其固定下来。正如印象派画家所指出的，写实主义并不真实，因为现实总是在变化，而 “写实主义” 描绘的是静态画面。 +

但就像音乐领域的变化一样，在外人看来，艺术家们似乎正在失去对现实的把握，以及细致描绘世界的能力。 +

艺术家们也越来越关注工业、城市和工人阶级的生活，而不再展现贵族特权。公园里的工人、洗衣熨衣的妇女、疲惫的日工和贫困潦倒的人取代了悠闲的赞助人，成为画作中的主角。 +

德国艺术家凯绥·珂勒惠支（Käthe Kollwitz）因强调穷人的脆弱和苦难，而非展现少数富人的高贵，激怒了贵族上层阶级。德国皇帝称她的木刻作品为 “低俗艺术”。 +

但此时，艺术家们不仅依靠富有的精英阶层定制自己拿着菠萝摆姿势的肖像画谋生，还通过公共委托和新兴的艺术经销商阶层赚钱。 +

这再次提醒我们，艺术家最终画什么，与最终购买他们画作的人有很大关系。 +

许多艺术家只能勉强维持生计——像19世纪的艺术家文森特·梵高（Vincent van Gogh），他让我们对当代那些忍饥挨饿、备受折磨的艺术家有了印象——但也有一些艺术家通过采用商业上受欢迎的风格而获得成功，比如新艺术运动（Art Nouveau）风格，其特点是藤蔓和其他植物的曲线造型，以及有着飘逸长发的浪漫化女性身体形象。 +

艺术家们还用新艺术运动风格设计了许多日常用品，从餐具到梳子。商业艺术家还为轮船公司、舞厅、咖啡馆、戏剧演出以及肥皂和咖啡品牌制作全彩广告海报。 +

这些海报被张贴在报亭和其他公共场所，因此新艺术运动风格通过极具效果的广告，点亮了城市日常空间，推动了百货商店和大众消费主义等现代现象的发展。 +

即使在今天，大约三分之一的大学宿舍里都能看到新艺术运动风格的广告海报。斯坦说，据他的经验，这个比例接近65%，但公平地说，我们俩都有二十年没进过宿舍了。 +

到世纪之交，艺术领域的变化变得更加激进。比如，画家保罗·塞尚（Paul Cézanne）用几何图形描绘苹果和橘子等物品。人体形状和自然界中的山脉等物体都变成了平面和球体。 +

紧接着，巴勃罗·毕加索（Pablo Picasso）不仅用几何色块描绘女性，还把她们的脸画成非洲面具的样子。1907年，瑞典艺术家希尔玛·阿夫·克林特（Hilma af Klint）创作了第一幅完全抽象的画作，与现实形态毫无关联。 +

这些艺术家大多和早期的印象派画家一样，深受来自殖民地和其他遥远地区的思想和信仰的影响。许多人认为，他们和殖民者掠夺其他资源一样，也在挪用这些思想和信仰。 +

但全球思想对欧洲艺术的影响是深远的。例如，阿夫·克林特和挪威画家爱德华·蒙克（Edvard Munch）试图捕捉通神论中宣扬的精神真理——通神论融合了源自佛教、印度教、伊斯兰教以及其他哲学和宗教传统的信仰与实践。 +

他们使用的颜色具有通神论教义中规定的含义。正确呈现这些色彩方案被认为可以描绘内在的现实。 +

蒙克的《呐喊》以独特的线条和色彩运用而闻名，人们认为这幅画是世纪之交现代主义的象征，尤其体现了在现代生活更快的节奏和压力下，许多人内心的痛苦。 +

科学领域也出现了同样具有革命性的思想，这些思想颠覆了我们对世界的认知。 +

让我们进入“思考泡泡”环节。 +

1896年，法国物理学家安托万·贝克勒尔（Antoine Becquerel）发现了放射性。 +
他还提出，元素可以通过原子的重新排列而发生变化。 +
随后，玛丽·居里（Marie Curie）和她的丈夫皮埃尔·居里（Pierre Curie）发现了放射性更强的元素钋和镭， +
科学家们由此确定原子并非实心的。 +
1900年，德国物理学家马克斯·普朗克（Max Planck）的量子理论改变了人们对能量的理解， +
尽管和几个世纪前的伽利略一样，他的理论在当时并未被接受。 +
在这个充满革命性的科学世界中，物理学家阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦（Albert Einstein）于1905年提出了狭义相对论。 +
根据这一理论，空间和时间并非绝对的范畴， +
而是会根据观察者的视角而变化。 +
只有光速是恒定不变的。 +
1915年，爱因斯坦发表了广义相对论， +
该理论将物体的引力与质量联系起来， +
并提出宇宙存在第四个数学维度。 +
爱因斯坦的能量理论对从电视到核弹等各种技术创新都至关重要。 +
正如我们在科学史系列中详细讨论的那样，普朗克、爱因斯坦等人的发现真正引发了一场远离早期现代牛顿科学的“范式转变”。 +
在很多方面，我们至今仍受着世纪之交这些重大发现的影响。 +

感谢“思考泡泡”环节。 +

长期以来，科学家们的发现和理论往往与人们对物理世界的常识性日常认知不符，对吧？ +

世界的中心刚刚打开了吗？里面有指南针吗？这就是我所说的一个很好的例子。 +

我们仍然会说太阳东升西落，对吧？因为实际上，对我们来说，看起来就是这样。尽管我们知道，事实并非如此。 +
稍微跑题一下，但当我闭上眼睛，从太空想象地球的样子时，我总是把北方想象在上方，对吧？就像南极洲在下方，北极在上方。但事实并非如此！为什么呢？ +

所以不可避免的是，为了知道何时左转、何时右转，我们在日常生活中描述世界的方式，会扭曲我们对世界的理解。 +

在这个充满变革的时代，思想家们不仅试图理解感知到的现实与客观现实之间的关系，还试图探索心灵，以及我们内心的自我与外在表现的自我之间的关系。 +

这就不得不提到弗洛伊德。 +

西格蒙德·弗洛伊德（Sigmund Freud）对启蒙运动中关于理性自我与合理决策、利己主义紧密相连的信念提出了质疑。因为，我们并非总是理性的，也并非总能做出合理决策、只考虑自身利益。 +

弗洛伊德认为，人类的自我或心理并非一个统一的理性个体，而是由三个相互争斗以争夺主导地位的部分组成：本我（或 libido，力比多），充满性能量，推动本能行为而非理性行为；自我，以维持生存的现实活动为核心；超我，充当良知的角色。 +

弗洛伊德开创了精神分析疗法，用于治疗这三个部分失衡，从而导致精神障碍或神经症的患者。 +

精神分析疗法包括一种“谈话疗法”，患者在治疗过程中尝试唤起被压抑的幻想、恐惧和欲望，以便理解并治愈这些心理问题。 +

弗洛伊德理论中一个特别有争议的部分是，他主张应该以科学的方式评估性生活，而不受宗教或道德评判的束缚。他认为，从婴儿时期开始，儿童就有性欲。为了维持文明的存在，这些欲望——尤其是在弗洛伊德心理学中，对乱伦的欲望——需要得到控制。 +

他还坚持认为，性别认同并非简单直接的概念，而是复杂的；女性和男性一样，有着强烈的性欲，并非像家庭生活倡导者所认为的那样没有激情。 +

尽管弗洛伊德的许多观点已被摒弃，但精神分析的影响一直延续至今。事实上，我今天下午晚些时候还要去看心理医生。 +

现在，人们更习惯与心理咨询师和治疗师交流，将问题公开讨论，而不是压抑在心里。我们也相信神经症的存在，并且认为我们的自我并非完全由理性和智力活动构成。 +

就像艺术家打破传统观念一样，弗洛伊德宣称我们对心灵的旧有观念已经过时，从而推动了现代主义的发展。 +

与此同时，其他理论家否定了科学和事实可用于揭示社会规律的观点。社会学和经济学等社会科学——仅举这两个例子——是围绕寻找持久的社会规律发展起来的。 +

认为可以发现社会事实和基本社会规律来指导公共政策的信念被称为实证主义，而那些持反对意见的人则认为，需要计算的事实太多，而且人类是复杂多变的，有时甚至有些不理性——无论是在经济决策还是社会决策方面。 +

我是说，不然你怎么解释21世纪初洞洞鞋（Croc）莫名其妙的流行呢？ +

这些被称为相对主义者和实用主义者的理论家至今仍在与实证主义者争论不休，如果你认为我们要卷入这场争论，那你就错了。 +

我们能否理性且自信地制定出绝对正确的法律？我相信你们会对此发表评论。 +

当时最具争议的思想家可能是德国哲学家弗里德里希·尼采（Friedrich Nietzsche），他否认真理的确定性，坚持认为所有知识都只是人类——从科学家到店主——的认知体现。 +

例如，人类的思维过滤了自然的本质，并构建出自己对自然真理的认知——这是人类对现实的一种诠释，而非现实本身。 +

尼采认为，包括古老宗教信条在内的绝对真理正在衰落。“上帝已死，是我们杀死了他。” 他的这句名言宣告了现代对宇宙的理解所带来的结果。 +

人类现在可以摆脱宗教和其他传统规则的束缚，愉快地寻找新的 “生命诗意”。 +

尼采最终感染了梅毒并患上精神疾病，他的妹妹将这位哲学家对传统价值观的蔑视转化为对犹太人的攻击，并支持民族主义者、反犹主义者和军国主义者——这提醒我们，现代主义思想可以被以各种方式利用。 +

在整个20世纪，我们将看到这些思想带来的悲剧性后果。 +

因此，世纪之交充满了新思想，从绘画、舞蹈到哲学、物理学，各种观念都被颠覆。 +

我们如今生活在一个受现代思想影响的世界，但同时，我们在交流方式和对真理的理解上，也正经历着深刻的变革。 +

这让我不禁思考，一个世纪后，我们这个时代的这些变革会是什么样子。后人会记住这个时代，认为人们通过通信工具变得更加亲近？还是会记住这个时代，认为随着两极分化的加剧，人们之间的距离越来越远？ +

这个问题的答案在一定程度上取决于你们，取决于你们将做出的选择，这些选择将塑造我们共同的未来。 +

感谢观看。我们下期再见。 +

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

So, the twentieth century opened with feminists smashing store windows. The Irish were contesting British rule; Russians were challenging royal rule in the Revolution of 1905. The French were fighting within families and across society over the plight of Jewish colonel Alfred Dreyfus, who'd been convicted of espionage on the basis of fabricated evidence.

And over the past few decades, anarchists had been assassinating heads of state and members of powerful families, including the empress of Austria-Hungary. And we'll talk more about all these upheavals, and the ways they helped shape twentieth century Europe, but today we want to turn to the arts, and sciences, and philosophical thought -- all of which both shaped and were shaped by the big political and social events of the day.

We often use terms like "art history" and "history of science" to separate out scientific and artistic pursuits from political and social history, but if history is the story of how our species got to now, the histories of art and philosophy and science are essential to, and inseparable from, human history.

[Intro]

Music, art, and dance had traditionally featured hummable and moving tunes, realistic depictions of graceful women and noble men, and the fluttering arms of waiflike ballerinas moving ethereally across the stage. By 1900, all that had changed with what is now called modern classical music, modern art, and modern dance.

The term "modernism" applies to the rejection or radical alteration of all that had come before in the arts and in thought. Some people see modernism as a rejection of the Enlightenment's rational approach to reality, but others believe that aspects of modernism such as abstraction demand a higher level of rationality.

That is, one has to use higher levels of thought in dealing with the abstract forms than concrete ones -- the idea of a number, for example, is more complicated and more interesting than counting.

But for contemporary audiences and critics, modern music sounded like screeching and scratching. Song gave way, in critics' views, to noise, even in modern dance. The ballet dancers in Rite of Spring made jerking movements and pounded the floor in so-called primitive rather than graceful ways. Ballerinas removed their tutus and ballet-toe slippers and danced in bare feet and tunics.

Choreographers and performers claimed to create these new movements by imitating foreign dancers seen at world fairs and in distant lands. And similarly, composers copied instrumentation and musical forms from Japan, Bali, South Asia, and other regions.

Audiences literally howled and walked out of these performances, but the world of dance and music had changed forever.

As for visual art: By becoming "modern," artists changed their style almost yearly, or at least so it seemed to some observers. "Make it new" was their motto, and the impressionists broke with realism in their paintings first by having human figures appear to float, without a stable background and without creating exact likenesses of faces, as you see in the paintings of Édouard Manet.

And then Claude Monet and his followers produced images of train stations and other urban buildings that shimmered with flecks and dabs of color instead of clear lines and realistic shading. They were trying to project the Japanese belief in mono no aware -- the fleetingness of life.

Indistinct colors and lines gave the "impression" of nature's constantly changing appearance instead of stabilizing it in "realism," which, as the impressionists pointed out, wasn't really real, because the real is always changing, while "realism" portrays static images.

But as with the changes in music, it appeared to outsiders that artists were losing their grip on reality and their skill in minutely depicting the world.

Artists also increasingly focused on industrial, urban, and working-class life instead of presenting aristocratic privilege. Leisured patrons were replaced by workers in parks, women doing laundry and ironing, fatigued day laborers, and the destitute.

German artist Käthe Kollwitz angered the aristocratic upper classes by emphasizing the frailty and suffering of the poor instead of showing the nobility of the prosperous few. The German Kaiser called her woodcuts "gutter art."

But by this time, artists were earning their livelihoods from public commissions and a new class of art dealers, not only from rich elites commissioning portraits of themselves posing with pineapples.

Another reminder that what artists end up painting has a lot to do with who ends up buying their paint.

Many artists only scraped by -- 19th-century artists like Vincent van Gogh helped give us our contemporary idea of the starving and tortured artist -- but others prospered by working in commercially advantageous styles like Art Nouveau, which featured curving lines of vines and other plant life, as well as romanticized women's bodies with long flowing hair.

Artists designed many everyday objects in the Art Nouveau style as well, from cutlery to combs. And commercial artists also produced full-color advertising posters for steamship lines, and dance halls, and cafés, and theater performances, and brands of soap and coffee.

These posters were displayed on kiosks and in other public spaces, so Art Nouveau brightened everyday urban space and advanced modern phenomena such as department stores and mass consumerism by being really effective advertising.

And even today, posters of Art Nouveau advertisements can be found in like one-third of college dorm rooms. Stan says that in his experience, it's closer to 65%, but to be fair, neither of us has been in a dorm room in like twenty years.

By the turn of the century, changes in art became even more radical. Like, painter Paul Cézanne depicted items like apples and oranges in geometric terms. Bodily shapes and those in nature like mountains became planes and spheres.

Immediately following, Pablo Picasso not only used geometric splotches to portray women but also depicted their faces as African masks. In 1907, Swedish artist Hilma af Klint produced the first entirely abstract painting with no relationship whatsoever to realistic forms.

And most of these artists, like the earlier impressionists, were deeply influenced by ideas and beliefs coming from the colonized world and other distant lands. Many would argue they were also appropriating those ideas and beliefs in much the same way colonizers were extracting other resources.

But the impact of global ideas on European art was profound. For example, af Klint and Norwegian Edvard Munch aimed to capture spiritual truths as preached in theosophy -- a mixture of beliefs and practices taken from Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, and other philosophical and religious traditions.

They used colors with meanings that were laid out in theosophical teachings. And presenting these schemes correctly was supposed to portray inner reality.

Munch's The Scream famously used line and color in ways that people believe to be emblematic of turn-of-the-century modernism, especially the internal distress that many felt amid the faster pace and tensions of modern life.

And there were similarly revolutionary ideas coming out of the world of science that would upend our understanding of the world.

Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

In 1896, French physicist Antoine Becquerel discovered radioactivity.
He also suggested that elements were changeable or mutable through the rearrangement of their atoms.
And then, from the discoveries of Marie Curie and her husband Pierre Curie,
who found the more radioactive elements polonium and radium,
scientists determined that atoms are not solid.
In 1900, German physicist Max Planck's quantum theory changed people's understanding of energy,
although like Galileo centuries earlier, his theories were not accepted at the time.
And amid this revolutionary scientific universe, physicist Albert Einstein announced his special theory of relativity in 1905.
According to this theory, space and time are not absolute categories
but instead vary according to the vantage point of the observer.
Only the speed of light is constant.
In 1915, Einstein published his general theory of relativity,
which connected the force, or gravity, of an object with its mass
and proposed a fourth mathematical dimension to the universe.
And Einstein's theories of energy became critical to all kinds of technological innovation, from television to the nuclear bomb.
As discussed in detail in our History of Science series, the findings of Planck, Einstein, and others really created a "paradigm shift" away from the Newtonian science of the early modern period.
And in many ways, we are still in the shadow of the tremendous discoveries at the turn of the century.
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

So, for a long time, scientists have made discoveries and produced theories that do not fit with common sense, everyday interpretations of the physical world. Right?

Did the center of the world just open? Is there a compass in there? This is a great example of what I mean.

We still say that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, right? Because practically, for us, it does. Even though, you know, it doesn't.

Slightly off topic, but when I close my eyes and imagine the Earth from space, I always picture North being up, right? Like, Antarctica is at the bottom, the North Pole is at the top. But no! Why?

So, inevitably, the way we need to represent the world in an everyday way, in order to know when to turn left and when to turn right, is going to skew our understanding of the world.

And during this revolutionary time, just as thinkers were trying to understand the relationship between perceived reality and objective reality, they were also trying to understand the mind, and the relationship between our interior selves and the selves we project.

Which brings us to Freud.

Sigmund Freud questioned the Enlightenment beliefs in a rational self wedded to reasonable decision-making and self-interest. Because, you know, we are not rational selves wedded to reasonable decision-making and self-interest.

Instead of a unified, rational persona, Freud claimed that the human self or psyche contains three parts struggling against one another for dominance: the ego, the part centered on realistic activity to survive; the id (or libido), the part alive with sexual energies pushing instinctual rather than rational behavior; and the superego, the part that acts as the conscience.

Freud developed the practice of psychoanalysis to treat the person in whom these three elements were out of balance enough to cause mental disturbances or neuroses.

Psychoanalysis involved a "talking cure" in which the patient tried to call forth repressed fantasies, and fears, and desires so that they might be understood and cured.

An especially controversial part of Freud's theories stated that sexual life should be evaluated scientifically without religious or moral judgments. According to him, from infancy on, children had sexual drives. And in order for civilization to exist, these drives -- most notably in the case of Freudian psychology, the drive toward incest -- needed to be controlled.

He also insisted that gender identity was not a straightforward entity but instead complicated and that women, like men, had strong sexual feelings; they weren't passionless, as advocates of domesticity maintained.

Although many of Freud's ideas have been abandoned, the influence of psychoanalysis extends to this day. In fact, I am visiting my therapist later this afternoon.

It's now more common to talk with counselors and therapists to bring our problems out in the open instead of repressing them. We also believe in the existence of neuroses and that our selves are not composed entirely of rationality and intellectual activity.

Just like artists crushing traditional beliefs, Freud advanced modernism by claiming that our old ideas about the mind itself were outdated.

Simultaneously, other theorists rejected the idea that science and facts could be used to uncover social laws. The social sciences of sociology and economics -- to name just two -- had developed around the pursuit of identifying enduring laws of society.

And the belief that you can discover social facts and basic social laws to guide public policy is called positivism, and it was challenged by those who held that there were too many facts to compute and that humans were complex and ever-changing and at times somewhat irrational -- both when it came to economic choices and when it came to social ones.

I mean, how else do you explain the strange early 21st-century rise of the Croc?

Those theorists called relativists and pragmatists have been in constant debate with positivists right up until now, and if you think we're getting in the middle of that, you're wrong.

Can we rationally and with confidence make infallible laws? Is a question I'm sure you'll be commenting upon.

Probably the most scandalous thinker of the time was the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who denied the certainty of truth, insisting that all knowledge simply represents what humans -- from scientists to shopkeepers -- have perceived.

The human mind, for example, filters what nature is and presents its own sense of nature's truth -- a human representation of reality rather than reality itself.

Nietzsche believed that absolute truths, including age-old tenets of religion, were in decline. "God is dead, we have killed him," he famously announced as the result of modern understandings of the universe.

Humans could now embark on the happy search for new "poetries of life" free from religious and other traditional rules.

Nietzsche eventually contracted syphilis and became mentally ill, and his sister converted the philosopher's disdain for traditional values into attacks on Jews and support for nationalists, and anti-Semites, and militarists -- a reminder that the ideas of modernism were tools that could be wielded in a variety of ways.

Which we will see, with tragic consequences, throughout the twentieth century.

And so the turn of the century was alive with fresh ideas, upending concepts from painting and dance to philosophy and physics.

And we are living today in a world wrought by modern ideas, but also one that is experiencing its own period of profound disruptions in the ways we communicate and how we understand truth.

And that makes me wonder how our revolutionary disruptions will seem a century from now. Will this time be remembered as one in which people grew closer together through tools of communication? Or will it be remembered as one in which people grew increasingly further apart as polarization worsened?

The answer to that is partly up to you, and the choices that you will make that will shape our shared future.

Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time.
