Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

Okay, so look: It has been bleak 惨淡的；凄凉的 so far.

We've had the Black Death, the 116 Years' War, a series of religious wars that culminated 达到顶点 with a 30 Years War that killed 20% of Central Europe.

We've had the little ice age and witch murdering mania 狂热 and the Atlantic slave trade, but now, now we get to turn our attention to the scientific revolution 科学革命, which profoundly 深刻地 reshaped 重塑 our understanding of the universe and ourselves.

At last, we are going to make real, undeniable 不可否认的 progress.

What's that?

Oh, Stan tells me that many of these scientists were persecuted 迫害 for sciencing.

Great.

But that doesn't stop humans from developing the central insight 深刻见解 that reshapes human history.

It's about to get really heliocentric 日心说的 around here...

Before we get into the scientific revolution, I just want to make one broad comment that might be obvious if you've watched previous videos in this series: For most of human history, people did not expect to live healthier or more prosperous 繁荣的；富裕的 lives than previous generations.

Sometimes life got better, and sometimes it got worse.

It's true that human populations were increasing and that life expectancy 预期寿命 was increasing gradually, but the idea that it is normal for human life to get better over time is very new.

Today, most European countries have high life expectancy, low maternal mortality 产妇死亡率, and low rates of absolute poverty 绝对贫困.

But there have been about 10,000 generations of humans, and we are perhaps the 10th generation who could reliably 可靠地 expect disease burden 疾病负担 and child mortality 儿童死亡率 and poverty to steadily 稳定地 decrease in our lifetimes.

Well, I'm part of the 10th.

You're probably part of the 11th.

But regardless, we owe much of this change to the Scientific Revolution.

So, like the Reformation 宗教改革, the Scientific Revolution was another break with religious teachings.

The Catholic Church taught that the earth was the center of the universe and had been so since the Creation 创世.

The sun, moon, and planets traveled around the earth in perfectly circular orbits 轨道 like the rings of an onion.

And beyond the onion was the realm 领域 of the divine 神的；神圣的, whose light pierced through 穿透 in the form of stars.

All this perfect motion was the work of God Himself.

And any other understanding of the universe was thus a challenge to God's eternal perfection 永恒完美 as described in the scriptures 经文.

But, like good Renaissance people, the new astronomers 天文学家, mathematicians 数学家, and their colleagues in other fields declared that old theories needed to be reexamined 重新审视.

The first problem was that the perfect orbits of the planets, and moon, and sun did not fit with observation, causing astronomers to resort to 求助于 ancient Ptolemaic 托勒密的 explanations (basically that planets followed their own circular paths, which also revolved around the Earth).

Just before his death in 1543, Polish-born Nicholas Copernicus, a well-connected doctor of canon law 教会法 and researcher in mathematics, and astronomy, and classical literature, published *On the Revolution of the Celestial Spheres*  《天体运行论》.

He noted problems with classical astronomical theory and determined that the universe was "heliocentric" — that is, the sun, rather than the earth, was at the center.

The Catholic Church's reaction to this was negative: the Italian monk Giordano Bruno, for instance, was burned at the stake 火刑处死 in 1600 for teaching Copernicus's heliocentric findings.

But even earlier than that, in 1572, Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe spotted 发现 a new star and in 1577 a new comet 彗星, further confirmation that the universe was not immutably 不变地 and perfectly created.

Then, Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion 行星运动定律 announced early in the seventeenth century that the orbits of the planets were elliptical 椭圆形的 — not perfectly circular.

The solar system was a solar system, and it wasn't an onion.

Something other than divine will 神意 was keeping the planets apart and in motion.

Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

By this time, the observations of Galileo Galilei were bringing matters to a head 使事情达到紧要关头.

Galileo was obsessed with 着迷于 science, especially its mathematical features and the calculations at the base of Copernicus's heliocentric theory.

Galileo's father had wanted him to become a doctor, but mathematics drew him in.

It's the oldest story in the world.

He invented many tools like an early thermometer 温度计 and his own telescope 望远镜, which he used to dramatically improve human understanding of the universe — he was the first person to observe the moons of Jupiter 木星, and the first to understand that the Milky Way 银河系 was a collection of stars.

The telescope also showed irregular spots on the sun, a further sign of heavenly imperfections 不完美 that went against the beliefs espoused 支持；拥护 by the Catholic Church.

Despite Galileo's prestige 声望 as a mathematician, his work on the nature of the universe went too far for the Church.

In 1615, Galileo went to Rome to teach the clergy 神职人员 about the heliocentric universe and convince them of its accuracy.

In 1616, it was condemned 谴责 as heretical 异教的, and Galileo promised not to teach that the earth moved.

But, in 1632, he published *Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems*  《关于两大世界体系的对话》, in which he described the Ptolemaic system on which the Church based its earth-centered astronomical teachings and the Copernican system.

In 1636, the Roman Inquisition 罗马宗教裁判所 found him guilty of heresy 异端罪 and forced him to recant 公开认错 in order to avoid execution 处决.

And so Galileo recanted.

In 1992, after a 13-year investigation, the Catholic Church finally publicly acknowledged that the judgment against him had been wrong.

Thanks, Thought Bubble.

Centuries later, Albert Einstein would write, "All knowledge of reality starts from experience and ends in it. ... Because Galileo saw this, and particularly because he drummed it into 反复灌输 the scientific world, he is the father of modern physics — indeed, of modern science altogether."

We talk about this at length 详细地, of course, in our history of science series, but for our purposes here, it's important to understand that Galileo and other scientists used experimentation 实验 and mathematical calculation 数学计算 to confirm or refute 反驳 hypotheses 假设 — and that scientific method 科学方法 was genuinely revolutionary 革命性的.

The scientific approach also spread to other fields of inquiry 探究领域.

Ancient medical theories began to unravel 瓦解, as English medical doctor William Harvey pronounced 宣称 the heart to be a pump based on dissections 解剖 he'd performed.

He called the heart "a piece of Machinery" that worked according to natural laws 自然法则.

But it's important to note that even as mechanical theories took hold 流行起来, prominent "new" scientists continued to believe in unseen forces 看不见的力量 at work in the universe.

For example, astrology 占星术, positing 假定；假设 that the planets and stars influenced people and events, sought to map those influences.

Some scientists found it credible 可信的 — and they pursued all kinds of mystical 神秘的, and occult 神秘的；超自然的, and alchemical 炼金术的 investigations.

Any revolution needs good propagandists 宣传者, and people were advertising that the "new" scientific values and practices were amazing while also pointing out that the ancient and traditional ones were full of errors.

English politician Francis Bacon was foremost 最重要的 among these science propagandists, chiding 指责 everyone who was using the old paradigms 范式 and models of the universe — calling them worthless ancients.

Bacon, like others at the time, created his own careful observations, and experiments, and sought to use reason 理性.

There was, he said, a scientific method to be followed.

One needn't rely on past accounts that were copies of copies of copies — one should ask their own questions, and do their own experiments to find the answer to those questions, experiments that other people could then replicate 复制 to confirm — or refute — the findings.

And this became the basis for the new scientific method as Bacon laid it out in *The Advancement of Learning*  《学术的进展》.

His process of reaching the truth and drawing conclusions from specific, reliable facts or evidence is called inductive reasoning 归纳推理.

And a collection of reliable, verified 证实的 evidence was essential, according to Bacon, not "old wives' fables 无稽之谈" or, as another new scientist put it, not "maunderings of a babbling hag 唠叨老妇的胡言乱语" — words that were part of the discourse 话语 of witches who were being tried and murdered at the time.

And then there was French philosopher René Descartes, who moved speculation 推测 about the new science to a still different methodological register 方法论层面 by looking at the mind.

Descartes noted that reason — thinking — was made for verification 验证, so thinking on one's own was crucial 至关重要的.

Because, otherwise, there were so many facts that one could essentially become skeptical 怀疑的 about whether truth actually existed.

Like, imagine a world where there are facts, but there are also "alternate" facts, and you have to choose between your set of facts before you reach a conclusion.

That would be unlivable!

So Descartes set out to prove the one thing he felt he could be sure of: his own existence.

And in doing so, he prioritized 优先考虑 his own power of thinking: "I think, therefore I am."

But he also prioritized doubt 怀疑, which is central to the scientific method — Descartes also wrote, "We cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt."

In short, our ability to conceive of 想象 doubt about whether we exist is proof that we exist.

By privileging 重视 the role that thought, and with it questioning, play in discovering truth, Descartes had developed deductive reasoning 演绎推理: that is, faith in the rational power of the mind to generate specific truths from its own theories or power of thinking.

(By the way, in addition to a Crash Course in the history of science, we also have a Crash Course in philosophy, where you can learn more about Descartes.)

Okay, let's turn our attention to Isaac Newton, who synthesized 综合 new methodology 方法论 and his own findings in his universal laws of motion 万有运动定律.

Newton was a scientist with a reputation for following every lead 线索.

Newton practiced alchemy 炼金术 — that is, the quest for 寻求 secret formulae 公式 and practices, especially an entity 实体 called the philosopher's stone 点金石 that could turn lead or other base metals 贱金属 into gold.

Which, by the way, would be an inflationary 通货膨胀的 disaster, but fortunately, it's impossible.

But I think that's important to note because it reminds us that not every lead being followed by scientists — then or now — results in big discoveries, but part of the glory of science is learning what doesn't work.

Also, it reminds us that in the 17th century, many of the smartest people in the world believed in alchemy, a nice opportunity to reflect on what false promises contemporary humans might believe.

At any rate, while studying alchemy, he also pulled together the findings of his predecessors 前辈 into mathematical laws for the functioning of the universe.

He quantified 量化 the major constructs 概念 of mass 质量, inertia 惯性, force 力, velocity 速度, and acceleration 加速度 and produced the law of gravitation 万有引力定律.

And he encapsulated 概括；总结 all his findings in his *Principia Mathematica*  《自然哲学的数学原理》in 1687.

For Newton, the universe was indeed a fantastic, regular, and all-encompassing 包罗万象的 machine, yet it was a machine still tinged with 带有…气息 the mysteries that he continued to decipher 破译, and, to be fair, that we are still deciphering today.

By the early decades of the seventeenth century, contact with the wider world led to other kinds of scientific investigations.

Adventurers 冒险家 brought back to Europe new species of plants, and textiles 纺织品, minerals 矿物, animal life that sparked wonder and scientific probing 探索.

One of the first to venture out 冒险出发 was Portuguese doctor Garcia da Orta.

He traveled first to Goa, India, studying plants like aloe 芦荟, cannabis 大麻, coconut 椰子, and ginger 生姜.

In 1563, he published *Conversations on the Simples, Drugs and Medicinal Substances of India*  《印度的草药、药物和药用物质对话录》, which advanced 推进 the use of plants as medicine.

Local people were key to major plant discoveries: Dr. da Orta, for instance, learned from healers 治疗师 in South Asia, while in the 1620s, local people in Lima cured a Jesuit priest with malaria 疟疾 by giving him the medicine they used — quina-quina.

Eventually, this healing bark 树皮 was turned into quinine 奎宁, a malaria medication that allowed Europeans to expand their empires more deeply into Africa and South America.

In the cases of both Doctor da Orta and the Jesuits in Peru, European advances, like others that would follow, depended on gathering up scientific and medical knowledge from other people.

Within Europe, scientific networks 科学网络 developed around heliocentrism 日心说 and also around other new ideas, just as they had in the Renaissance.

Like Erasmus and his correspondents 通信者, Galileo and scientists across Europe wrote one another and published books about their findings.

The Royal Society of London had its "republic of letters 文学界".

And communication like that became pivotal 关键的 both to verification and to convince as much of the public as possible that these new scientific discoveries were valid 有效的.

Amid warfare, the little ice age, and famine 饥荒, these scientists were corresponding 通信 about comets 彗星, windmills 风车, pumps 泵, and blood vessels 血管.

Theories about vision 视觉 and atomism 原子论 passed around in letters reached as far as the Ottoman Empire 奥斯曼帝国 and Japan.

Governments also got in on the Scientific Revolution, giving scientists like Galileo stipends 津贴 to support their work, and labeling them "Court Mathematicians 宫廷数学家", which added prestige 增添声望 both to the scientist and the royal court 王室 itself.

Louis XIV of France started one of the most prestigious 享有声望的 scientific academies 科学院 — the royal Academy of Sciences — in 1666.

And Theaters of anatomy 解剖剧场, where dissections and other physiological demonstrations 生理演示 occurred, also received official sponsorship 官方赞助.

Oh, did the globe open at last?

Is Yorick in there?

Alas, poor Yorick... I didn't know eyebrows were a skeletal feature 骨骼特征.

For the first, like, 98 percent of history, we knew so little about how all of this works.

Look, I'm never going to be a ventriloquist 口技表演者, OK?

Stan, this isn't a real skull, is it?

Ugh!

We will examine the mounting power 日益增长的权力 of the state next week beyond its sponsorship of science.

For the moment, let's reflect on the ways in which so-called new scientists during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries bravely took religious scriptures 宗教经文 out of the workings of astronomy 天文学 and the heavens 天体.

Instead of a divine hand 神之手 at work, by the time of Newton, universal laws 普遍规律 for the operation of the solar system and physical bodies 天体 had been established.

Although most people believed in God, many of them earnestly 虔诚地 so, they also followed a developing scientific method and additionally established faith in their own rational powers 理性能力.

This way of looking at the world would prove so important that less than 350 years after Galileo became the first person to observe the moon's cratered surface 有陨石坑的表面, human beings would step foot on that surface.

Thanks for watching.

I'll see you next time.

== 中文释义

大家好，我是约翰·格林，这里是《速成欧洲史》。
好吧，听着：到目前为止，历史的发展一直很 bleak 。
我们经历了黑死病、长达116年的战争，还有一系列宗教战争，最终以一场导致中欧20%人口死亡的三十年战争达到顶峰。
我们遭遇了小冰期、猎杀女巫的狂热, 以及大西洋奴隶贸易。但现在，我们终于可以将注意力转向科学革命了，这场革命深刻地重塑了我们对宇宙和自身的理解。
终于，我们要取得真正无可否认的进步了。

什么？
哦，斯坦告诉我，这些科学家中有许多人因为从事科学研究而受到迫害。
太棒了。
但这并不能阻止人类得出那个重塑人类历史的核心见解。
这里马上就要变得以太阳为中心了……

在深入探讨科学革命之前，我想先做一个宽泛的评论，如果你看过本系列之前的视频，这一点可能显而易见：*在人类历史的大部分时间里，人们并不期望自己能过上比前几代人更健康、更富裕的生活。*
生活有时变好，有时变差。
的确，人类人口在增加，预期寿命也在逐渐提高，但**认为"人类生活随着时间推移自然变好"是一种非常新的观念。**
如今，大多数欧洲国家人口预期寿命高，孕产妇死亡率低，绝对贫困率也低。

人类大约已经经历了1万代，而我们可能是能够切实期望在有生之年看到疾病负担、儿童死亡率和贫困率稳步下降的第10代人。

嗯，我属于第10代。
你可能属于第11代。

但无论如何，*我们能有这样的变化，很大程度上要归功于科学革命。*
所以，*就像宗教改革一样，科学革命是对宗教教义的又一次突破。*

天主教会教导说，地球是宇宙的中心，自创世以来一直如此。
太阳、月亮和行星像洋葱的圈层一样，以完美的圆形轨道围绕地球运行。
在洋葱圈层之外是神圣的领域，其光芒以星星的形式穿透而来。
所有这些完美的运动都是上帝的杰作。

因此，对宇宙的任何其他理解, 都是对圣经中所描述的上帝永恒完美的挑战。

*但是，就像优秀的文艺复兴时期的人们一样，新的天文学家、数学家以及其他领域的同行们宣称，旧理论需要重新审视。*

**第一个问题是，行星、月亮和太阳完美的轨道, 与观测结果不符，**这使得天文学家不得不借助古代托勒密的解释（基本上是说行星沿着自己的圆形轨道运行，而这些轨道也围绕着地球旋转）。

1543年，波兰出生的尼古拉斯·哥白尼（Nicholas Copernicus）在去世前不久，发表了《天体运行论》（On the Revolution of the Celestial Spheres） 。哥白尼是一位人脉广泛的教会法博士，同时也是数学、天文学和古典文学的研究者。

他指出了经典天文学理论的问题，并确定宇宙是“日心说”的——也就是说，太阳，而不是地球，才是宇宙的中心。

天主教会对此的反应是负面的：例如，意大利修道士焦尔达诺·布鲁诺（Giordano Bruno）就因为传播哥白尼的日心说发现，于1600年被处以火刑。

但甚至在那之前，1572年，丹麦天文学家第谷·布拉赫（Tycho Brahe）发现了一颗新恒星，1577年又发现了一颗新彗星，这进一步证实了宇宙并非是一成不变且完美被创造出来的。

然后，*约翰内斯·开普勒（Johannes Kepler）在17世纪初提出的行星运动定律表明，行星的轨道是椭圆形的——并非完美的圆形。*

太阳系就是一个太阳系，而不是一个洋葱。

除了神的意志之外，还有其他力量让行星保持距离, 并处于运动状态。

让我们进入“思想泡泡”环节。

到这个时候，伽利略·伽利雷（Galileo Galilei）的观测让事情达到了紧要关头。
伽利略痴迷于科学，尤其痴迷于科学的数学特征以及哥白尼日心说理论基础中的计算。
伽利略的父亲曾希望他成为一名医生，但数学吸引了他。
这是世界上最古老的故事了。

他发明了许多工具，比如早期的温度计和他自己的望远镜，他用这些工具极大地提高了人类对宇宙的理解——他是第一个观测到木星卫星的人，也是第一个认识到银河系是由恒星组成的人。
望远镜还显示出太阳上有不规则的斑点，这进一步表明天体并非完美，与天主教会所宣扬的信仰相悖。

尽管伽利略作为一名数学家享有盛誉，但他在宇宙本质方面的研究, 对教会来说还是太过分了。

1615年，伽利略前往罗马，向神职人员讲解日心说宇宙，并试图让他们相信其准确性。

1616年，日心说被谴责为异端邪说，伽利略承诺不再传播地球是运动的这一观点。

但是，1632年，他出版了《关于两大世界体系的对话》（Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems） ，在书中他描述了教会用以支持其地心说天文学教义的"托勒密体系"，以及"哥白尼体系"。

1636年，罗马宗教裁判所判定他犯有异端罪，并迫使他放弃自己的观点，以避免被处决。
于是伽利略放弃了自己的观点。

1992年，经过13年的调查，天主教会终于公开承认对他的判决是错误的。

感谢“思想泡泡”。

几个世纪后，阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦（Albert Einstein）写道：“所有关于现实的知识, 都始于经验, 并终结于经验。……因为伽利略看到了这一点，尤其是因为他向科学界反复强调这一点，所以他是现代物理学之父——事实上，是整个现代科学之父。”

当然，我们在科学史系列中详细讨论过这个问题，但就我们这里的讨论目的而言，*#重要的是要理解，伽利略和其他科学家使用实验和数学计算, 来证实或反驳假设——而这种科学方法确实具有革命性。#*

这种科学方法也传播到了其他研究领域。

古代医学理论开始瓦解，英国医生威廉·哈维（William Harvey）通过自己进行的解剖, 宣布心脏是一个泵。
他称心脏是一个“机械装置”，按照自然规律运作。

但需要注意的是，即使机械理论逐渐被接受，杰出的“新”科学家们仍然相信, 宇宙中存在着无形的力量在起作用。
例如，占星术假定行星和恒星会影响人类和事件，并试图描绘这些影响。
一些科学家认为占星术是可信的——他们还进行了各种神秘学、神秘主义和炼金术的研究。

**任何一场革命都需要优秀的宣传者(媒体, 科普者)，人们宣传说“新”的科学价值观和实践令人惊叹，同时也指出古代和传统的那些充满了错误。**

英国政治家弗朗西斯·培根（Francis Bacon）是这些科学宣传者中的佼佼者，他斥责所有使用旧的宇宙范式和模型的人——称他们为毫无价值的古人。
**培根**和当时的其他人一样，进行了自己细致的观察和实验，并试图运用理性。 +
他**说，有一种科学方法是需要遵循的。人们不必依赖那些经过多次复制的过去的记载——#人们应该提出自己的问题，并通过自己的实验,来找到这些问题的答案，其他人可以重复这些实验, 来证实或反驳这些发现。#**

正如培根在《学术的进展》（The Advancement of Learning） 中所阐述的，这成为了新科学方法的基础。

他##**从具体、可靠的事实或证据中, 得出真理和结论的过程, 被称为"归纳推理"。**##

根据培根的观点，**可靠、经过验证的证据的收集, 是至关重要的，而不是“老妇人(或某个统治者说)的故事”，**或者如另一位新科学家所说，*不是“一个喋喋不休的老巫婆的胡言乱语”——这些话是当时那些正在接受审判并被杀害的女巫们言论的一部分。*

然后是法国哲学家勒内·笛卡尔（René Descartes），他通过研究思维，将对新科学的思考, 提升到了一个不同的"方法论"层面。

*笛卡尔指出，#理性——思考——是为了"验证"而存在的，所以独立思考至关重要。#*
因为，否则的话，有太多的事实，人们基本上会对真理是否真的存在产生怀疑。
想象一下这样一个世界，这里有事实，但也有“替代性”事实，在你得出结论之前，你必须在自己的那套事实中做出选择。
那将是无法忍受的！

所以笛卡尔着手证明他觉得自己能确定的一件事：他自己的存在。
在这个过程中，他优先考虑自己的思考能力：“我思故我在。”
但他也优先考虑怀疑，这是科学方法的核心——笛卡尔还写道：“当我们怀疑时，我们不能怀疑自己的存在。”
简而言之，我们能够对"自己是否存在"产生怀疑, 这一能力就是我们"确实存在着"的证明。

通过重视思维, 以及随之而来的质疑, 在发现真理过程中的作用，*笛卡尔发展出了演绎推理*：也就是说，相信思维的理性力量能够从其自身的理论或思考能力中, 推导出具体的真理。
（顺便说一下，除了科学史速成课，我们还有哲学速成课，在那里你可以了解更多关于笛卡尔的内容。）

好的，让我们把注意力转向艾萨克·牛顿（Isaac Newton），他在万有运动定律中, 综合了新的方法论和他自己的发现。

牛顿是一位以不放过任何线索而闻名的科学家。
*牛顿曾从事炼金术*——也就是说，他追求秘密的配方和实践，尤其是一种被称为“哲人之石”的东西，据说它可以把铅或其他贱金属变成黄金。
顺便说一下，*那将是一场通货膨胀的灾难，但幸运的是，这是不可能的。*

但我认为这一点很重要，需要提一下，因为这提醒我们，*无论是当时还是现在，科学家们追寻的线索, 并非都能带来重大发现，但科学的荣耀之一就在于了解哪些方法是行不通的。(反向排除法)*

同时，这也提醒我们，在17世纪，世界上许多最聪明的人都相信炼金术，这是一个很好的机会，让我们反思当代人类可能会相信哪些虚假的承诺。

无论如何，在研究炼金术的同时，他还将前辈们的研究成果, 整合为宇宙运行的数学定律。
他对质量、惯性、力、速度和加速度等主要概念, 进行了量化，并提出了万有引力定律。
1687年，他在《自然哲学的数学原理》（Principia Mathematica） 中总结了自己的所有发现。
对牛顿来说，宇宙确实是一台奇妙、规则且包罗万象的机器，但这台机器仍然充满了他继续努力破解的奥秘，而且公平地说，我们今天也仍在努力破解这些奥秘。

*在17世纪的最初几十年里，与更广阔世界的接触, 引发了其他类型的科学研究。
冒险家们把新的植物物种、纺织品、矿物质和动物带回欧洲，这些都引发了人们的好奇和科学探索。*

最早冒险外出的人之一, 是葡萄牙医生加西亚·达·奥尔塔（Garcia da Orta）。
他先前往印度的果阿（Goa），研究了芦荟、大麻、椰子和生姜等植物。
1563年，他出版了《关于印度的草药、药物和药用物质的对话》（Conversations on the Simples, Drugs and Medicinal Substances of India） ，推动了植物作为药物的应用。

当地人是重大植物发现的关键：例如，达·奥尔塔医生, 从南亚的治疗师那里学到了知识，而在17世纪20年代，利马（Lima）的当地人用他们使用的药物——"金鸡纳树皮"治愈了一位患有"疟疾"的耶稣会牧师。
最终，这种具有治疗作用的树皮, 被制成了"奎宁"，一种抗疟疾药物，使得欧洲人能够更深入地将他们的帝国扩张到非洲和南美洲。

在达·奥尔塔医生和秘鲁的耶稣会士的例子中，和后来的其他情况一样，欧洲的进步, 依赖于从其他人那里收集科学和医学知识。

在欧洲内部，围绕"日心说"以及其他新思想的科学网络, 也发展起来了，就像文艺复兴时期一样。

就像伊拉斯谟（Erasmus）和他的通信者们一样，伽利略和欧洲各地的科学家们相互通信，并出版关于他们研究成果的书籍。
伦敦皇家学会（The Royal Society of London）有它的“文学共和国”。
这样的交流,对于验证研究成果, 以及尽可能让公众相信这些新的科学发现是有效的，都变得至关重要。

在战争、小冰期和饥荒期间，这些科学家们还在通信中讨论彗星、风车、水泵和血管。 -
关于视觉和原子论的理论, 通过信件传播，远至奥斯曼帝国和日本。

*政府也参与到了科学革命中，给像伽利略这样的科学家发放津贴, 以支持他们的工作，并授予他们“宫廷数学家”的称号，这既为科学家增添了声望，也提升了王室的地位。* +
法国的路易十四（Louis XIV）在1666年创办了最负盛名的科学学院之一——皇家科学院（the royal Academy of Sciences）。

进行解剖, 和其他生理学演示的解剖剧场（Theaters of anatomy）, 也得到了官方的赞助。

哦，地球仪终于打开了吗？
里面是约里克（Yorick）吗？
唉，可怜的约里克……我之前都不知道眉毛是骨骼的特征。
在历史的大约前98%的时间里，我们对这一切是如何运作的了解甚少。

听着，我永远都当不了腹语者，好吗？
斯坦，这不是一个真正的头骨，对吧？
呃！
下周我们将探讨国家除了赞助科学之外, 不断增强的力量。

目前，让我们思考一下，在16和17世纪，所谓的新科学家们是如何勇敢地将宗教经文从天文学和天体的运作中剔除出去的。
到牛顿的时代，取代上帝之手作用的, 是太阳系和天体运行的普遍规律。
尽管大多数人都信仰上帝，而且许多人是真诚地信仰，但他们也遵循着不断发展的科学方法，并且还建立起了对自己理性力量的信心。
事实证明，这种看待世界的方式非常重要，以至于在伽利略成为第一个观测到月球坑洼表面的人之后不到350年，人类就踏上了月球表面。

感谢观看。
下次再见。

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

Okay, so look: It has been bleak so far.

We've had the Black Death, the 116 Years' War, a series of religious wars that culminated with a 30 Years War that killed 20% of Central Europe.

We've had the little ice age and witch murdering mania and the Atlantic slave trade, but now, now we get to turn our attention to the scientific revolution, which profoundly reshaped our understanding of the universe and ourselves.

At last, we are going to make real, undeniable progress.

What's that?

Oh, Stan tells me that many of these scientists were persecuted for sciencing.

Great.

But that doesn't stop humans from developing the central insight that reshapes human history.

It's about to get really heliocentric around here...

Before we get into the scientific revolution, I just want to make one broad comment that might be obvious if you've watched previous videos in this series: For most of human history, people did not expect to live healthier or more prosperous lives than previous generations.

Sometimes life got better, and sometimes it got worse.

It's true that human populations were increasing and that life expectancy was increasing gradually, but the idea that it is normal for human life to get better over time is very new.

Today, most European countries have high life expectancy, low maternal mortality, and low rates of absolute poverty.

But there have been about 10,000 generations of humans, and we are perhaps the 10th generation who could reliably expect disease burden and child mortality and poverty to steadily decrease in our lifetimes.

Well, I'm part of the 10th.

You're probably part of the 11th.

But regardless, we owe much of this change to the Scientific Revolution.

So, like the Reformation, the Scientific Revolution was another break with religious teachings.

The Catholic Church taught that the earth was the center of the universe and had been so since the Creation.

The sun, moon, and planets traveled around the earth in perfectly circular orbits like the rings of an onion.

And beyond the onion was the realm of the divine, whose light pierced through in the form of stars.

All this perfect motion was the work of God Himself.

And any other understanding of the universe was thus a challenge to God's eternal perfection as described in the scriptures.

But, like good Renaissance people, the new astronomers, mathematicians, and their colleagues in other fields declared that old theories needed to be reexamined.

The first problem was that the perfect orbits of the planets, and moon, and sun did not fit with observation, causing astronomers to resort to ancient Ptolemaic explanations (basically that planets followed their own circular paths, which also revolved around the Earth).

Just before his death in 1543, Polish-born Nicholas Copernicus, a well-connected doctor of canon law and researcher in mathematics, and astronomy, and classical literature, published On the Revolution of the Celestial Spheres.

He noted problems with classical astronomical theory and determined that the universe was "heliocentric" -- that is, the sun, rather than the earth, was at the center.

The Catholic Church's reaction to this was negative: the Italian monk Giordano Bruno, for instance, was burned at the stake in 1600 for teaching Copernicus's heliocentric findings.

But even earlier than that, in 1572, Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe spotted a new star and in 1577 a new comet, further confirmation that the universe was not immutably and perfectly created.

Then, Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion announced early in the seventeenth century that the orbits of the planets were elliptical -- not perfectly circular.

The solar system was a solar system, and it wasn't an onion.

Something other than divine will was keeping the planets apart and in motion.

Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

By this time, the observations of Galileo Galilei were bringing matters to a head.

Galileo was obsessed with science, especially its mathematical features and the calculations at the base of Copernicus's heliocentric theory.

Galileo's father had wanted him to become a doctor, but mathematics drew him in.

It's the oldest story in the world.

He invented many tools like an early thermometer and his own telescope, which he used to dramatically improve human understanding of the universe -- he was the first person to observe the moons of Jupiter, and the first to understand that the Milky Way was a collection of stars.

The telescope also showed irregular spots on the sun, a further sign of heavenly imperfections that went against the beliefs espoused by the Catholic Church.

Despite Galileo's prestige as a mathematician, his work on the nature of the universe went too far for the Church.

In 1615, Galileo went to Rome to teach the clergy about the heliocentric universe and convince them of its accuracy.

In 1616, it was condemned as heretical, and Galileo promised not to teach that the earth moved.

But, in 1632, he published Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, in which he described the Ptolemaic system on which the Church based its earth-centered astronomical teachings and the Copernican system.

In 1636, the Roman Inquisition found him guilty of heresy and forced him to recant in order to avoid execution.

And so Galileo recanted.

In 1992, after a 13-year investigation, the Catholic Church finally publicly acknowledged that the judgment against him had been wrong.

Thanks, Thought Bubble.

Centuries later, Albert Einstein would write, "All knowledge of reality starts from experience and ends in it. ... Because Galileo saw this, and particularly because he drummed it into the scientific world, he is the father of modern physics -- indeed, of modern science altogether."

We talk about this at length, of course, in our history of science series, but for our purposes here, it's important to understand that Galileo and other scientists used experimentation and mathematical calculation to confirm or refute hypotheses -- and that scientific method was genuinely revolutionary.

The scientific approach also spread to other fields of inquiry.

Ancient medical theories began to unravel, as English medical doctor William Harvey pronounced the heart to be a pump based on dissections he'd performed.

He called the heart "a piece of Machinery" that worked according to natural laws.

But it's important to note that even as mechanical theories took hold, prominent "new" scientists continued to believe in unseen forces at work in the universe.

For example, astrology, positing that the planets and stars influenced people and events, sought to map those influences.

Some scientists found it credible -- and they pursued all kinds of mystical, and occult, and alchemical investigations.

Any revolution needs good propagandists, and people were advertising that the "new" scientific values and practices were amazing while also pointing out that the ancient and traditional ones were full of errors.

English politician Francis Bacon was foremost among these science propagandists, chiding everyone who was using the old paradigms and models of the universe -- calling them worthless ancients.

Bacon, like others at the time, created his own careful observations, and experiments, and sought to use reason.

There was, he said, a scientific method to be followed.

One needn't rely on past accounts that were copies of copies of copies -- one should ask their own questions, and do their own experiments to find the answer to those questions, experiments that other people could then replicate to confirm -- or refute -- the findings.

And this became the basis for the new scientific method as Bacon laid it out in The Advancement of Learning.

His process of reaching the truth and drawing conclusions from specific, reliable facts or evidence is called inductive reasoning.

And a collection of reliable, verified evidence was essential, according to Bacon, not "old wives' fables" or, as another new scientist put it, not "maunderings of a babbling hag" -- words that were part of the discourse of witches who were being tried and murdered at the time.

And then there was French philosopher René Descartes, who moved speculation about the new science to a still different methodological register by looking at the mind.

Descartes noted that reason -- thinking -- was made for verification, so thinking on one's own was crucial.

Because, otherwise, there were so many facts that one could essentially become skeptical about whether truth actually existed.

Like, imagine a world where there are facts, but there are also "alternate" facts, and you have to choose between your set of facts before you reach a conclusion.

That would be unlivable!

So Descartes set out to prove the one thing he felt he could be sure of: his own existence.

And in doing so, he prioritized his own power of thinking: "I think, therefore I am."

But he also prioritized doubt, which is central to the scientific method -- Descartes also wrote, "We cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt."

In short, our ability to conceive of doubt about whether we exist is proof that we exist.

By privileging the role that thought, and with it questioning, play in discovering truth, Descartes had developed deductive reasoning: that is, faith in the rational power of the mind to generate specific truths from its own theories or power of thinking.

(By the way, in addition to a Crash Course in the history of science, we also have a Crash Course in philosophy, where you can learn more about Descartes.)

Okay, let's turn our attention to Isaac Newton, who synthesized new methodology and his own findings in his universal laws of motion.

Newton was a scientist with a reputation for following every lead.

Newton practiced alchemy -- that is, the quest for secret formulae and practices, especially an entity called the philosopher's stone that could turn lead or other base metals into gold.

Which, by the way, would be an inflationary disaster, but fortunately, it's impossible.

But I think that's important to note because it reminds us that not every lead being followed by scientists -- then or now -- results in big discoveries, but part of the glory of science is learning what doesn't work.

Also, it reminds us that in the 17th century, many of the smartest people in the world believed in alchemy, a nice opportunity to reflect on what false promises contemporary humans might believe.

At any rate, while studying alchemy, he also pulled together the findings of his predecessors into mathematical laws for the functioning of the universe.

He quantified the major constructs of mass, inertia, force, velocity, and acceleration and produced the law of gravitation.

And he encapsulated all his findings in his Principia Mathematica in 1687.

For Newton, the universe was indeed a fantastic, regular, and all-encompassing machine, yet it was a machine still tinged with the mysteries that he continued to decipher, and, to be fair, that we are still deciphering today.

By the early decades of the seventeenth century, contact with the wider world led to other kinds of scientific investigations.

Adventurers brought back to Europe new species of plants, and textiles, minerals, animal life that sparked wonder and scientific probing.

One of the first to venture out was Portuguese doctor Garcia da Orta.

He traveled first to Goa, India, studying plants like aloe, cannabis, coconut, and ginger.

In 1563, he published Conversations on the Simples, Drugs and Medicinal Substances of India, which advanced the use of plants as medicine.

Local people were key to major plant discoveries: Dr. da Orta, for instance, learned from healers in South Asia, while in the 1620s, local people in Lima cured a Jesuit priest with malaria by giving him the medicine they used -- quina-quina.

Eventually, this healing bark was turned into quinine, a malaria medication that allowed Europeans to expand their empires more deeply into Africa and South America.

In the cases of both Doctor da Orta and the Jesuits in Peru, European advances, like others that would follow, depended on gathering up scientific and medical knowledge from other people.

Within Europe, scientific networks developed around heliocentrism and also around other new ideas, just as they had in the Renaissance.

Like Erasmus and his correspondents, Galileo and scientists across Europe wrote one another and published books about their findings.

The Royal Society of London had its "republic of letters."

And communication like that became pivotal both to verification and to convince as much of the public as possible that these new scientific discoveries were valid.

Amid warfare, the little ice age, and famine, these scientists were corresponding about comets, windmills, pumps, and blood vessels.

Theories about vision and atomism passed around in letters reached as far as the Ottoman Empire and Japan.

Governments also got in on the Scientific Revolution, giving scientists like Galileo stipends to support their work, and labeling them "Court Mathematicians," which added prestige both to the scientist and the royal court itself.

Louis XIV of France started one of the most prestigious scientific academies -- the royal Academy of Sciences -- in 1666.

And Theaters of anatomy, where dissections and other physiological demonstrations occurred, also received official sponsorship.

Oh, did the globe open at last?

Is Yorick in there?

Alas, poor Yorick... I didn't know eyebrows were a skeletal feature.

For the first, like, 98 percent of history, we knew so little about how all of this works.

Look, I'm never going to be a ventriloquist, OK?

Stan, this isn't a real skull, is it?

Ugh!

We will examine the mounting power of the state next week beyond its sponsorship of science.

For the moment, let's reflect on the ways in which so-called new scientists during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries bravely took religious scriptures out of the workings of astronomy and the heavens.

Instead of a divine hand at work, by the time of Newton, universal laws for the operation of the solar system and physical bodies had been established.

Although most people believed in God, many of them earnestly so, they also followed a developing scientific method and additionally established faith in their own rational powers.

This way of looking at the world would prove so important that less than 350 years after Galileo became the first person to observe the moon's cratered surface, human beings would step foot on that surface.

Thanks for watching.

I'll see you next time.
