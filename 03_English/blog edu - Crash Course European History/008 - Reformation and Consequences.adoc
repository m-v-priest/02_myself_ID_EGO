[[TV Window]] Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course European History, and today we're going to watch religious reform 宗教改革 spread, while states shape up their operations to make them better adapted to governance 治理. And also making war. Mostly making war.

As you'll recall from our last episode, the Peace of Augsburg was supposed to settle the religious divisions that resulted from the Protestant Reformation 新教改革. I mean, it was called the Peace of Augsburg after all. But, well, Stan, unfortunately we're going to have to switch the TV to the religious war graphic.

[[TV: Religious War]] The 1555 Peace of Augsburg did bring peace to the Holy Roman Empire, temporarily 暂时地, at least. Although I guess all peace is temporary. Really, everything is temporary. I'm sorry, what were we talking about? We'll get to existentialism 存在主义 later, but in the meantime, there was turmoil 动荡 almost everywhere else in Europe.

For one thing, monarchs 君主 were starting to see the need to centralize 集中 and professionalize 职业化 the exercise of state power. This was necessary because they needed more money, especially for weaponry 武器, including increasingly lethal 致命的 cannons 大炮, and money for building roads, harbors, and ships -- so they could move war-making stuff around, and also other goods. To pay for all of this, they used better tax collection -- and also piracy 海盗行为 and global expansion.

Both Ivan the Terrible in Russia and Suleyman the Magnificent, the Ottoman sultan 苏丹, were taking new territory. And moreover, with Protestantism 新教 fragmenting 分裂 and moving so swiftly in many directions, there was a sense that unifying a state's people, notably in religion, would hold kingdoms together and keep citizens prospering 繁荣 instead of killing one another.

European monarchs also employed legal scholars to help regularize 使规范化 the law and use it to unify their administrations 行政机构. The monarchs who focused on instituting 建立 tight state organization and expanding royal power are sometimes called the "New Monarchs," even though of course now they are quite old. What's that? Stan informs me that in fact they are not old, they are all currently deceased 已故的.

But as these new monarchs sought to consolidate 巩固, new religious sub-groups, or sects 教派, were constantly splintering 分裂 European communities. As Protestantism evolved, some of these sects promoted more radical 激进的 kinds of equality that fanned out from the idea that all people could have a direct connection to God. And that proved problematic 有问题的 not only for religious hierarchies 等级制度, like the Catholic Church, but also for political ones, like aristocracies 贵族 and monarchies 君主制.

Some Anabaptists 再洗礼派, for instance, used sola scriptura 唯独圣经 (Latin: by Scripture alone) to experiment with polygamy 一夫多妻制, citing 引用 the Bible's command to "be fruitful and multiply." And Quakers 贵格会教徒 encouraged women to preach and engage in religious activism  activism 宗教 activism 宗教活动. Now that was radical.

Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

The appeal of new sects, and reformers 改革者, and preachers 传教士 pulled at the fabric of political unity and secure power that monarchs desperately craved 渴望.
Jean Calvin of France was foremost 最重要的 among these reformers.
Like Martin Luther, Calvin started by studying law and, like Luther, eventually dropped it for theology 神学.
Then in 1534, large posters denouncing 谴责 the Catholic Church appeared all over Paris -- an event called the Affair of the Placards 标语事件.
French authorities rounded up 围捕 suspected Protestants, executing 处决 some of them, and causing others, including Calvin, to flee.
France and the French -- even those from the highest ranks of the nobility -- became violently divided among religious factions 派系 for several generations.
Meanwhile, from exile 流放 in Geneva, Calvin set up a theocracy 神权政治 -- that is, a state based on and run according to religious doctrine 教义.
Calvin's most important addition to Protestantism was the concept of predestination 预定论.
Calvin maintained that God had determined even before the creation of the world which of its humans would be saved and which would be damned 诅咒 as sinners.
For a variety of reasons, he felt that citizens needed to be strictly regulated 管制 to keep them from falling into sin and to maintain their godly nature.
So, for instance, he imposed fines 罚款 for drunkenness 酗酒, and blasphemy 亵渎神明, and dancing, and gambling 赌博.
But wait a second. Those are all of the major hobbies.
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

So, Calvin's theocracy in Geneva came to be known as the Protestant Rome; it was the epicenter 中心 of the Reformed Church, and Calvin himself was seen as a "father" to the many who left their families to participate in this experiment too. Calvinism 加尔文宗 became even more far-flung 广泛传播的 than Lutheranism 路德宗, with communities springing up from the British Isles to Hungary and other parts of eastern European regions.

[[TV: Henry VIII]] So, at the same time, Henry VIII of England was using Protestantism in an entirely new way -- to get divorced and acquire 获得 land. Henry was working to consolidate his kingdom after a long civil war known as the War of the Roses, and he was married to Catherine of Aragon, who was the aunt of Charles V, which made her a politically desirable spouse 配偶 if not the perfect romantic match.

Henry's circle included famous Christian humanists like Thomas More, and also the noblewoman Anne Boleyn, who backed religious reform and with whom Henry was enamored 迷恋的. And that was a bit of a problem, as Henry was already married. Refused a divorce by the pope, Henry cut his ties with Rome, divorced Catherine of Aragon, banished 驱逐 her from his royal court, and then announced himself to be the head of the Church of England.

He then gained support for this move by selling off Church lands, especially monasteries 修道院 and convents 女修道院, to aristocrats and other wealthy allies to keep them on his side. The Church of England or "Anglican" doctrine 圣公宗教义 was modified slightly from that of the Catholic Church, but the main change was that the power of the state increased dramatically in England by combining secular 世俗的 and religious authority in one figure: the king. It also meant that instead of shipping money to Rome, more wealth flowed into the royal treasury 国库.

Plus it meant that Henry could marry Anne Boleyn, which he did, and then later executed 处决 her for purported 据称的 treason 叛国罪. Thomas More was also executed for refusing to acknowledge Henry as the head of the church, and although power had been concentrated in the state, the actual citizenry 公民 remained very divided over religion.

[[TV: Mary Queen of Scots]] This came to a head after Henry's death. Initially, Henry's nine-year-old son became King Edward VI, but he died, possibly of tuberculosis 肺结核, at just age 15. After a struggle for power, Henry's daughter Mary became Queen of England. Mary wanted to take England back to the Catholic Church and soon married a Catholic, Charles V's son, Philip II of Spain.

This move might have united England and much of mainland Europe under one royal family and the Catholic Church, except that Mary died in 1558, at the age of just 42.

[[TV: Elizabeth I]] Mary's sister Elizabeth, who'd been persecuted 迫害 and for a time imprisoned during Mary's reign, became Queen, and restored 恢复 England to Protestantism. Although Mary's husband Philip wrote that he "felt a reasonable regret over her death," he ended up missing Catholic England very badly -- so badly that he launched the famous Spanish Armada 西班牙无敌舰队 to take back England for his family and the Church. But thanks in part to bad weather, Elizabeth's England defeated the armada.

Elizabeth built up the royal treasury and found a more moderate 温和的 path when it came to religion than either her sister or her father had found. Philip, meanwhile, managed to bankrupt 使破产 Spain despite all the New World gold and silver that was flowing in. One of the great lessons of history is that wars are expensive, another great lesson of history? Don't forget about inflation 通货膨胀. Philip and his court did not have a great understanding of inflation, and did not comprehend 理解 why the appearance of more gold in Europe led the price of gold to decline.

[[TV: Iconoclasts]] Meanwhile, in France, the spread of Calvinism tore at the French crown and nobility as it stirred controversy 争议 and conflict in cities. Ideas of Calvinist reformation merged with social and political resistance in France as city councils and aristocrats began to fight over the role of both church and state.

Did the globe open up? Is there a gnome  gnome 地精 in there? It's a statue. And in France at the time, people began smashing statues of saints and breaking the noses of statues of the Virgin Mary. These people were called iconoclasts 反偶像者 -- that is, literal destroyers of icons 圣像. Iconoclasm 反偶像主义 sounds kind of fun. I'm gonna try destroying this icon. I feel powerful. We shall rise up and say no to garden gnomes! Especially in films! Like Gnomeo and Juliet. And the other one. We shouldn't be making jokes.

All this led to Civil War. Gallicanism 高卢主义 -- a French interpretation of Catholicism -- arose in the cities and towns of southwestern France. Gallicanism held that French political authority -- not the pope in Rome -- ruled the Church in France. French Calvinists, meanwhile, became known as "Huguenots 胡格诺派". Religious wars broke out in 1559. Rival 敌对的 leaders in France, even in the face of political disaster, refused to come to any agreement.

The Catholic-Protestant division increased until a group of nobles was assassinated 暗杀 in 1572, and then thousands of Huguenots in Paris and elsewhere were killed in what is known as the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre 圣巴托洛缪大屠杀 later that year.

[[TV: Henry of Navarre]] A Huguenot named Henry of Navarre narrowly escaped death in the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre; years later, he would lead Protestant forces against the Catholic government in the Civil War before eventually converting to Catholicism, purportedly 据称 saying, "Paris is well worth a mass." And that's how Henry of Navarre became King Henry IV of France.

But although Henry was now Catholic, he issued the Edict of Nantes 南特敕令 in 1598, which allowed Protestantism in the French Kingdom. Like Elizabeth, Henry was a politically savvy 精明的 monarch who found middle paths through difficult conflicts. Those who put aside their personal beliefs to accomplish political tranquility 安宁, especially in France, came to be known as politiques 政治家（指重现实利益的政客）.

These days, of course, it seems impossible that politics could increase tranquility, but imagine how political slickness 手腕 must have seemed to a 16th century French or English person. I mean, war beget war beget war -- until monarchs found a different way. And from that perspective, politics is -- dare I say it -- magnificent.

[[TV: Window]] Across Europe, the conflict over religion drew in an extensive cast of characters -- among them both high-born aristocratic women and common women rioting 暴动 in the streets of major cities. Luther himself had argued for the equality of souls but an inequality in public life, writing, "The dominion 统治 of women from the beginning of the world has never produced any good; as one is accustomed to saying: 'Women's rule seldom comes to a good end.' When God installed Adam as lord over all creatures, everything was still in good order and proper, and everything was governed in the best way. But when the wife came along and wanted to put her hand too in the simmering broth and be clever, everything fell apart and became wildly disordered."[1]

Still, the "Protestant Reformation" had a lot of appeal for many women. The idea of a direct relationship with God via scripture 经文 encouraged common people, including women and girls, to learn to read. Protestant women set up schools for Protestant girls. And of course in England, a woman ruled both the nation and the church.

Now even with the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and the Edict of Nantes, the century-long lethal 致命的 struggles over religion were not entirely over, but several momentous 重大的 changes had occurred: new ideas about human spirituality 灵性 had been born and taken hold across Europe; people so fervently 热切地 believed in these reformed religions that they left home and family to create new communities; new-style monarchs had aimed for earthly power and begun to consolidate government, in part to pay for instruments of religious warfare; Spain under Charles V and Philip II had gone from riches to rags in order to enforce Catholicism.

Next time, we'll turn our attention to the less political revolutions taking place in 16th century Europe -- revolutions in commerce 商业, and agriculture, and urban development, as well as a transcontinental 跨大陆的 system of slavery that created vast wealth for some, and absolute devastation 毁灭 for many others. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time.

== 中文释义


[[电视窗口]] 大家好，我是约翰·格林，这里是《速成欧洲史》。今天我们将见证宗教改革的传播，同时各国正调整运作模式, 以更好地治理国家——当然，也在筹备战争，而且主要是在筹备战争。

正如我们在上一集提到的，《奥格斯堡和约》本应解决"新教改革"引发的宗教分裂问题。毕竟，它被称为《奥格斯堡和约》。但可惜的是，斯坦，我们得把电视画面切换到宗教战争的图表了。

[[电视画面：宗教战争]] **1555年的《奥格斯堡和约》确实给神圣罗马帝国带来了和平，至少是暂时的。不过我想##所有和平都是暂时的，##万物皆短暂。**抱歉，我们刚才在讨论什么？存在主义的话题稍后再谈，眼下欧洲其他地区几乎都陷入了动荡。

一方面，君主们开始意识到, *需要将国家权力的行使集中化和专业化。这是因为他们需要更多资金，尤其是用于购置武器（包括杀伤力日益增强的大炮），以及修建道路、港口和船只——这样他们才能运输战争物资和其他商品。为了支付这些费用，他们改进了税收制度，同时也依靠海盗活动和全球扩张。*

俄罗斯的“恐怖伊凡”（伊凡四世）, 和奥斯曼苏丹“苏莱曼大帝”, 都在扩张新领土。此外，**随着"新教"迅速分裂, **并向多个方向发展，人们普遍认为，统一国家的宗教信仰, 有助于维系王国团结，让公民繁荣而非相互残杀。

欧洲君主还雇佣法律学者来规范法律，并利用法律统一行政体系。这些致力于建立严密国家组织, 并扩张王权的君主, 有时被称为“新君主”，尽管现在他们当然都已作古。什么？斯坦告诉我，事实上他们不是“作古”，而是都已去世。

*但就在这些新君主试图巩固权力时，新的宗教 subgroup（教派）不断分裂着欧洲社会。随着新教的发展，##一些教派宣扬更激进的平等观念，其核心思想是"所有人都能与上帝直接沟通"。##这不仅对天主教会等宗教等级制度构成挑战，#也对贵族和君主制等政治等级制度造成冲击。#*

例如，**一些再洗礼派信徒, 援引《圣经》中“要生养众多”的诫命，利用“唯独圣经”（sola scriptura）的理念, 尝试"一夫多妻制"。**贵格会则鼓励女性传教, 并参与宗教活动——这在当时堪称激进。

让我们进入“思想泡泡”环节。

新教派、改革者和传教士的吸引力, 撕裂了君主们迫切渴望的政治统一和稳固权力的架构。*法国的让·加尔文（Jean Calvin）是这些改革者中的领军人物。*

和马丁·路德一样，加尔文最初学习法律，最终也为神学放弃了法律。1534年，巴黎各地突然出现大量谴责天主教会的海报——这一事件被称为“标语事件”（Affair of the Placards）。法国当局逮捕了涉嫌的新教徒，处决了其中一些人，包括加尔文在内的其他人则被迫逃亡。*此后几代人，法国社会（甚至贵族阶层）因宗教派系, 陷入激烈分裂。*

与此同时，流亡日内瓦的加尔文, 建立了神权政治（theocracy）——即"基于宗教教义,并按其运行的国家"。**#加尔文对"新教"最重要的贡献是“预定论”（predestination）概念。他认为，上帝甚至在创世之前, 就已决定哪些人将得救、哪些人将作为罪人受罚。(命定论. 否认了人的主观能动性.)#**出于多种原因，他认为必须严格规范公民行为，防止他们陷入罪恶, 并维持其神性。因此，他对酗酒、亵渎神灵、跳舞和赌博等行为, 处以罚款。但等等，这些可都是主流爱好啊。

感谢“思想泡泡”。

加尔文在日内瓦的神权政治, 后来被称为“新教罗马”，这里成为归正教会的中心，加尔文本人也被许多背井离乡参与这一实验的人视为“教父”。**加尔文宗（Calvinism）的传播范围甚至比路德宗更广泛，**从不列颠群岛, 到匈牙利及东欧其他地区，都涌现出相关社区。

[[电视画面：亨利八世]] 与此同时，**英国的亨利八世（Henry VIII）以一种全新的方式利用"新教"——为了离婚和夺取土地。**在被称为“玫瑰战争”的长期内战后，亨利致力于巩固王国统治。他当时的妻子是阿拉贡的凯瑟琳（Catherine of Aragon），她是查理五世的姑姑，这使她成为政治上理想的配偶，尽管未必是完美的爱情伴侣。

亨利的圈子里有托马斯·莫尔（Thomas More）等著名的基督教人文主义者，还**有支持宗教改革的贵族女性安妮·博林（Anne Boleyn），亨利对她一见钟情。但问题在于亨利已经结婚。由于教皇拒绝批准离婚，亨利与罗马决裂，**与阿拉贡的凯瑟琳离婚, 并将其逐出宫廷，*随后宣布自己为英国国教会（Church of England）领袖。*

**为了获得支持，他将教会土地（尤其是修道院和女修道院）, 出售给贵族和其他富有的盟友，以拉拢他们。#英国国教会（"圣公会"）的教义, 与"天主教"略有不同，但主要变化在于通过将世俗和宗教权力集于国王一身，英国的国家权力急剧增强。这也意味着财富不再流向罗马，而是更多流入王室国库。#**

此外，亨利得以与安妮·博林结婚（后来又以叛国罪将其处决）。托马斯·莫尔也因拒绝承认亨利的教会领袖地位, 被处决。*尽管权力集中于国家，但英国民众在宗教问题上仍存在严重分歧。*

[[电视画面：苏格兰玛丽女王]] **这种分歧在亨利死后达到顶点。**起初，亨利九岁的儿子爱德华六世（Edward VI）继位，但他可能因"肺结核"在15岁时便夭折。经过权力争夺，**亨利的女儿玛丽（Mary）成为英国女王。玛丽希望使英国回归天主教，**不久后嫁给了天主教徒——查理五世的儿子、西班牙的菲利普二世（Philip II）。

这一举动本可能将英国和欧洲大陆大部分地区, 统一在同一个王室和天主教之下，但玛丽在1558年便去世了，年仅42岁。

[[电视画面：伊丽莎白一世]] **玛丽的妹妹伊丽莎白（Elizabeth）, 在玛丽统治期间曾遭迫害并一度入狱，她继位后, 使英国重新皈依"新教"。**尽管玛丽的丈夫菲利普曾写道“对她的去世感到合理的遗憾”，但他其实非常怀念天主教的英国——以至于发动了著名的西班牙无敌舰队（Spanish Armada），试图为家族和教会夺回英国。但部分由于恶劣天气，伊丽莎白的英国击败了无敌舰队。

伊丽莎白充实了王室国库，并在宗教问题上, 找到了比她的姐姐和父亲更温和的道路。与此同时，菲利普尽管坐拥美洲新大陆流入的大量金银，却使西班牙濒临破产。**#历史的一大教训是战争耗资巨大，另一个教训是？不要忘记"通货膨胀"。#**菲利普及其宫廷对通货膨胀理解不足，也不明白为何**#欧洲黄金增多, 会导致金价下跌。#**

[[电视画面：反偶像主义者]] 与此同时，**在法国，加尔文宗的传播, 引发了城市中的争议和冲突，撕裂着法国王室和贵族阶层。**随着市政议会和贵族开始争夺教会与国家的角色，加尔文改革思想, 与社会政治抵抗, 相互交织。

地球仪打开了吗？里面有个地精雕像？当时的法国，人们开始砸碎圣徒雕像，甚至敲掉圣母玛利亚雕像的鼻子。这些人被称为“反偶像主义者”（iconoclasts）——即字面意义上的“偶像破坏者”。反偶像主义听起来有点有趣，我要试试摧毁这个“偶像”（指雕像）。感觉自己力量大增。我们应该起来反抗花园地精！尤其是电影里的！比如《吉诺密欧与朱丽叶》里的，还有另一部。不过我们不该开这种玩笑。

*这一切最终引发了内战。*“高卢主义”（Gallicanism，法国对天主教的一种诠释）在法国西南部城镇兴起，主张法国的政治权威（而非罗马教皇）统治法国教会。与此同时，法国加尔文主义者被称为“胡格诺派”（Huguenots）。*1559年，宗教战争爆发。法国各派领袖即使面临政治灾难，也拒绝达成任何协议。*

"天主教"与"新教"的分裂愈演愈烈，直到1572年一群贵族被暗杀，随后巴黎及其他地区数千名胡格诺派信徒, 在当年的“圣巴托洛缪大屠杀”（St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre）中遇害。

[[电视画面：纳瓦拉的亨利]] 一位名叫纳瓦拉的亨利（Henry of Navarre）, 在圣巴托洛缪大屠杀中死里逃生，多年后他率领"新教"军队, 对抗"天主教"政府，最终皈依天主教，据称他曾说：“巴黎值得一场弥撒。”就这样，纳瓦拉的亨利成为法国国王亨利四世（Henry IV）。

*##尽管亨利现在是天主教徒，但他在1598年颁布了《南特敕令》（Edict of Nantes），允许"新教"在法国存在。##和伊丽莎白一样，亨利是一位政治 savvy 的君主，在艰难的冲突中找到了中间道路。在法国，那些为实现政治稳定而放下个人信仰的人, 被称为“政略派”（politiques）。*

如今，政治似乎不可能带来稳定，但试想一下，这种政治手腕在16世纪的法国或英国人眼中是多么了不起。战争引发更多战争，直到君主们找到不同的道路。从这个角度看，政治——我敢说——堪称“宏伟”。

[[电视画面：窗口]] 在整个欧洲，宗教冲突牵涉到广泛的人物——包括出身高贵的贵族女性, 和在大城市街头暴动的普通女性。**路德本人曾主张"灵魂平等"，但公开宣称"生活中的不平等"，**他写道：“从世界之初，女性统治从未带来任何好处；正如人们常说：‘女人的统治很少有好结局。’当上帝立亚当为万物之主时，一切井然有序，治理得再好不过。但当妻子介入，想把手伸进滚烫的汤里‘耍小聪明’时，一切都分崩离析、混乱不堪。”[1]

**尽管如此，“新教改革”对许多女性仍有巨大吸引力。##通过《圣经》与上帝直接沟通的理念, 鼓励包括女性和女孩在内的普通人学习阅读。##新教女性为新教女孩创办了学校。**当然，在英国，一位女性同时统治着国家和教会。

*##即使有伊丽莎白女王的统治, 和《南特敕令》，长达一个世纪的宗教暴力冲突, 仍未完全结束，但几项重大变革已经发生：##1.关于"人类精神性"的新思想, 在欧洲诞生并扎根；2.##人们对这些改革宗教的信仰如此狂热，以至于离开家庭去创建新社区；##3.#新型君主追求世俗权力, 并开始巩固政府#，4.部分原因是为宗教战争筹资；查理五世和菲利普二世统治下的##西班牙为推行天主教, 从富庶走向衰败。##*

下一次，我们将关注16世纪欧洲发生的"非政治性革命"——商业、农业和城市发展领域的革命，以及跨大陆的奴隶制体系，它为一些人创造了巨额财富，却给许多人带来了彻底的灾难。感谢观看，下期再见。

We shall rise up and say no to garden gnomes! Especially in films! Like Gnomeo and Juliet. And the other one. We shouldn't be making jokes.

All this led to Civil War. Gallicanism -- a French interpretation of Catholicism -- arose in the cities and towns of southwestern France. Gallicanism held that French political authority -- not the pope in Rome -- ruled the Church in France. French Calvinists, meanwhile, became known as "Huguenots." Religious wars broke out in 1559. Rival leaders in France, even in the face of political disaster, refused to come to any agreement.

The Catholic-Protestant division increased until a group of nobles was assassinated in 1572, and then thousands of Huguenots in Paris and elsewhere were killed in what is known as the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre later that year.

[[TV: Henry of Navarre]] A Huguenot named Henry of Navarre narrowly escaped death in the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre; years later, he would lead Protestant forces against the Catholic government in the Civil War before eventually converting to Catholicism, purportedly saying, "Paris is well worth a mass." And that's how Henry of Navarre became King Henry IV of France.

But although Henry was now Catholic, he issued the Edict of Nantes in 1598, which allowed Protestantism in the French Kingdom. Like Elizabeth, Henry was a politically savvy monarch who found middle paths through difficult conflicts. Those who put aside their personal beliefs to accomplish political tranquility, especially in France, came to be known as politiques.

These days, of course, it seems impossible that politics could increase tranquility, but imagine how political slickness must have seemed to a 16th century French or English person. I mean, war beget war beget war -- until monarchs found a different way. And from that perspective, politics is -- dare I say it -- magnificent.

[[TV: Window]] Across Europe, the conflict over religion drew in an extensive cast of characters -- among them both high-born aristocratic women and common women rioting in the streets of major cities. Luther himself had argued for the equality of souls but an inequality in public life, writing, "The dominion of women from the beginning of the world has never produced any good; as one is accustomed to saying: 'Women's rule seldom comes to a good end.' When God installed Adam as lord over all creatures, everything was still in good order and proper, and everything was governed in the best way. But when the wife came along and wanted to put her hand too in the simmering broth and be clever, everything fell apart and became wildly disordered."[1]

Still, the "Protestant Reformation" had a lot of appeal for many women. The idea of a direct relationship with God via scripture encouraged common people, including women and girls, to learn to read. Protestant women set up schools for Protestant girls. And of course in England, a woman ruled both the nation and the church.

Now even with the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and the Edict of Nantes, the century-long lethal struggles over religion were not entirely over, but several momentous changes had occurred: new ideas about human spirituality had been born and taken hold across Europe; people so fervently believed in these reformed religions that they left home and family to create new communities; new-style monarchs had aimed for earthly power and begun to consolidate government, in part to pay for instruments of religious warfare; Spain under Charles V and Philip II had gone from riches to rags in order to enforce Catholicism.

Next time, we'll turn our attention to the less political revolutions taking place in 16th century Europe -- revolutions in commerce, and agriculture, and urban development, as well as a transcontinental system of slavery that created vast wealth for some, and absolute devastation for many others. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time.
