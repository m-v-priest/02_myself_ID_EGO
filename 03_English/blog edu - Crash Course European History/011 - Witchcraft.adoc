Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

So, in the first episode of this series, we talked about the significance 重要性；意义 of the year 1431.

Remember, that was the year Joan of Arc was burned to death for heresy 异端邪说 and witchcraft 巫术；魔法 because the English were so bewildered 使迷惑；把…难住 that a teenage peasant 农民；农夫 girl could lead the French army to victory 胜利；成功 that they decided she had to be a witch 女巫 and a heretic 持异端邪说者.

And, you know, it was pretty bewildering 使迷惑；把…难住 that a random peasant 农民；农夫 girl somehow basically became for a time the most important general 将军；大将 in the most important war of the fifteenth century.

That said, just to state the obvious 显而易见的；明白的；普通的: Joan of Arc was not a witch 女巫.

But just as she benefited from superstitions 迷信 and prophecies 预言 about mystically 神秘地；不可思议地 powerful women, she was ultimately 最终；最后 destroyed by fears of witchcraft 巫术；魔法 and dark magic.

For the past four episodes, the world has been turned upside down in the century after Joan's trial 审判；试验 and execution 执行；处死.

The Reformation 宗教改革, Commercial 商业的；贸易的 and Agricultural 农业的 Revolutions 革命, and Counter-Reformation 反宗教改革 were each in their own way shaking social 社会的, and economic 经济的；有利可图的, and political 政治的；政府的, and religious 宗教的 structures 结构；构造.

Perhaps some witches 女巫 could explain that turmoil 混乱；骚动.

So, for most of European history, and indeed 确实；实在；当然 for most of world history, people believed in unseen powers that operated across their world and in their individual lives.

Objects from nature could be healing 治愈的；有治疗作用的 or poisonous 有毒的；引起中毒的, working in unknown ways.

Like, Queen Elizabeth once received a ring that was supposed to protect her from the plague 瘟疫；灾祸.

Most towns had shamans 巫师；萨满, a "wise" man or woman, a wizard 男巫；术士, a sorcerer 巫师；魔法师, or another resident 居民；住户 who knew about potions 药水；符咒, and poultices 药膏；糊剂, and charms 符咒；魅力.

And look, Queen Elizabeth never got the plague 瘟疫；灾祸, so it was easy to conclude 推断出；断定 that sometimes, at least, this stuff worked!

As one bishop 主教 wrote in 1552, "When we be in trouble, or sickness, or lose anything, we run hither and thither to witches 女巫 or sorcerers 巫师；魔法师, whom we call wise men, . . . seeking aid 帮助；援助 and comfort 安慰；慰问 at their hands."

Other wise men could use eclipses 日食；月食, or sunspots 太阳黑子, or comets 彗星 and various natural phenomena 自然现象 to predict 预测；预言 momentous 重大的；重要的 future events.

Like, earthquake tremors 地震 in Istanbul in 1648 for instance, were said to foretell 预示；预言 the murder 谋杀；凶杀 of the sultan 苏丹 two months later.

All these shamans 巫师；萨满, and fortune tellers 算命先生；预言家, and special healers 治疗师；巫医 were widely depicted 描绘；描述 in the many books now streaming from the printing press 印刷机 -- with stories that often strayed from reality 现实；实际.

The reading public seemed to revel in 沉溺于；狂欢 tales of witches 女巫: their special witches' rites 仪式；惯例, their antics 滑稽动作；古怪行为 and adventures 冒险；奇遇, their sexual perversions 性变态；反常行为, and their attacks on (and corruption of) the innocent 无辜的；清白的.

Jean Bodin was a famed 著名的；出名的 and influential 有影响力的；有权势的 jurist 法学家；法律专家 who wrote about sovereignty 主权；统治权 -- that is, the nature 本质；性质 of state power and authority 权力；权威 -- in this age of new monarchy 君主制；君主政体 and governmental consolidation 巩固；合并.

He also famously 著名地；出名地 wrote about witches 女巫 and demonology 恶魔学 in the vernacular 本国语；方言 so that a large group would have access to 接近；进入 his pieces.

And I think it's important to note Bodin because his work underscores 强调；突出 that in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries high-minded 高尚的；有远见的 political 政治的；政府的 theory 理论；学说 of government and the everyday world of witches 女巫 co-existed 共存.

I think this can be one of the great empathy 同情；共情 barriers 障碍；壁垒 in history -- it can be hard for some of us to imagine a world where it was almost universally 普遍地；一致地 assumed 假定；认为 that the hand of God and the hand of the Devil were constantly 不断地；经常地 shaping events both large and small.

But one of the discomforting 令人不安的；使人难受的 things about humanity 人性；人类 is the role luck or fate 命运；天数 or however you consider it plays in our lives, and we all have a desire 渴望；期望 for life to be a story that makes sense.

Saying "Everything happens for a reason" is one way of doing that; saying, "Witches 女巫 did it" is another.

In some ways, history itself is an attempt 尝试；努力 to tell a story that makes sense -- we're trying to find narratives 叙述；故事 amid an endlessly 无止境地；不断地 complicated 复杂的；难懂的 web of forces and choices and luck.

So I hope thinking about that can help you empathize 同情；共情 a bit.

But back to witches 女巫: Art is another place we see a lot of witchcraft 巫术；魔法.

In grand baroque 巴洛克式的 paintings, you can find devils 魔鬼；恶棍, serpents 蛇, old hags 老巫婆；丑老太婆, and other signs of evil 邪恶；罪恶 filtering across society 社会；社团.

Like, in Rubens' massive 巨大的；大规模的 painting "Madonna on the Crescent Moon," featured 特色在于；以…为特色 at the altar 祭坛；圣坛 of the Cathedral 大教堂 of Freising, the entire left third displays devils 魔鬼；恶棍, and demons 恶魔；邪灵, and the serpent 蛇 of sin 罪孽；罪过 for parishioners 教区居民.

And "Council of the Gods," one of Rubens' celebratory 庆祝的；祝贺的 works on the life of Marie de Medici, depicts 描绘；描述 a witch-like figure at the extreme right.

And it's important to note that Rubens was working from images that had already been around for a long time, in the form of black and white engravings 版画；雕刻 of the devil 魔鬼；恶棍 and witches 女巫 in broadsheets 街头传单；报纸和书籍.

So we know ideas about witches 女巫 were plentiful 丰富的；充足的.

But where did they actually originate 起源；发生?

The Bible doesn't say much about them, though there is this prominent 显著的；杰出的 statement 陈述；声明 in Exodus 出埃及记 22:18: "Thou shalt not suffer 使受苦；遭受 a witch 女巫 to live."

Popular culture, however, drew on 利用；凭借 pagan 异教的；未开化的 mythology 神话；神话故事, full of wily 狡猾的；诡计多端的 sorceresses 女巫；魔法师 and enchantresses 女巫；迷人的女子 using love potions 爱情药水 and charms 符咒；魅力 to work their magic.

And people saw woodcuts 木刻画；版画 of witches 女巫 in flight or they heard about magicians 魔术师；巫师 on flying coats or carpets 地毯 or they went to healers 治疗师；巫医 and unexpectedly 意外地；出乎意料地 died.

But again, we look for stories that make sense, and it makes sense that a healer 治疗师；巫医 with their medicinal 药用的；有疗效的 potions 药水；符咒, might also have access to 接近；进入 poisonous 有毒的；引起中毒的 or other dangerous 危险的；不安全的 potions 药水；符咒.

So there were a few lines from the Bible, a growing collection of scary stories through the Middle Ages, and then came Heinrich Kramer's Witches' Hammer (Malleus Malificarum) in 1487.

Kramer was a Dominican 多米尼克会的 monk 修士 whose book was amazingly 令人惊奇地；不可思议地 popular 受欢迎的；流行的 -- for over a century, it was the second bestselling book in Europe behind only the Bible, and the book argues that Satan 撒旦, due to the fact the Apocalypse 启示录 is coming, has "caused a certain unusual heretical 持异端邪说的 perversity 反常；乖戾 to grow up in the land of the Lord -- a heresy 异端邪说, I say, of Sorceresses 女巫；魔法师, since it is to be designated 指明；标明 by the particular 特定的；特殊的 gender 性别 of which he [Satan 撒旦] is known to have power."

The book goes on to describe in detail 详细地 the many evils 邪恶；罪恶 of these mostly female practitioners 从业者；实践者 of witchcraft 巫术；魔法, and to advocate 提倡；主张 all-out war against them.

These days, Kramer's book reads like aggressively 侵略性地；好斗地 misogynistic 厌女症的 fantasy fiction 奇幻小说 -- he writes that women are "defective 有缺陷的；不完美的 in all the powers of both soul 灵魂；心灵 and body" and claims 声称；断言 that witches 女巫 were, among many other things, practicing cannibalism 同类相食 and causing male impotence 阳痿；性无能.

Because of course if you have magical 神奇的；魔法的 powers, that's how you're going to use them.

But at the time, Witches' Hammer was tremendously 巨大地；惊人地 influential 有影响力的；有权势的.

The book was first approved 批准；认可, then disapproved 不赞成；反对 by religious 宗教的 authorities 权威；权力机构.

But as Europeans engaged with 参与；从事 pagan 异教的；未开化的 practices 实践；习俗, Kramer's witchcraft 巫术；魔法 manifesto 宣言 gave them a new context 背景；环境.

Amid 在…之中；在…中间 the religious 宗教的, economic 经济的；有利可图的, and social 社会的 challenges 挑战；难题 of these stressful 紧张的；有压力的 centuries 世纪；百年, the hunt for witches 女巫 accelerated 加速；加快 and became lethal 致命的；危险的.

It's really important to understand that the idea of witchcraft 巫术；魔法 felt to many Christians 基督教徒 in the sixteenth century like a real threat 威胁；恐吓.

Did the center 中心；中央 of the world just open?

Is there a black cat in there?

Oh, it must be time for a PSA.

Hi!

I'm John Green.

This is not an evil 邪恶的；罪恶的 cat!

It's just a regular 普通的；平常的 nice cat that happens to have one color of fur.

Don't be mean to 刻薄地对待；对…不好 these cats.

These are great cats!

This one happens to be fake 假的；伪造的 because Stan said I couldn't put a real cat inside the globe.

Stan!

But that's not the point.

The point is that this cat is not bad luck.

It is not involved in 参与；涉及 witchcraft 巫术；魔法.

It is a great cat.

Or, it would have been a great cat if Stan had let me use a real cat.

So, beginning in 1560 in villages 村庄 and cities 城市 across Europe, a stream of supposedly 据说；据称 demonic 恶魔的；邪恶的 incidents 事件；事故 took place and a raft of persecutions 迫害；残害 followed.

Between 1560 and 1800, between 50,000 to 100,000 people were tried for witchcraft 巫术；魔法 in the European world.

Unlike Joan of Arc, most purported 据称的；声称的 witches 女巫 had little to do with the grand 宏伟的；壮丽的 and tumultuous 动荡的；骚乱的 events of those years.

Like Joan, the vast majority 绝大多数；大部分 -- approximately 大约；近似地 80 percent -- were women.

And like Joan, many were executed 执行；处死.

Almost all major 主要的；重要的 works of demonology 恶魔学 during these years were published 出版；发行 in German or in Latin with a German publisher -- the Holy Roman Empire 神圣罗马帝国 therefore 因此；所以 was one major 主要的；重要的 center 中心；中央 of the hunt for witches 女巫.

In 1564, judges 法官；裁判员 for the town council 市议会 of Augsberg, a city in the south of the German empire, questioned 询问；审问 the healer 治疗师；巫医 Anna Megerler when a boy she had cared for died of a wound 伤口；创伤.

While being intensely 强烈地；剧烈地 grilled 盘问；审讯, Megerler said that she had taught secret knowledge to the mighty 强大的；有力的 Anton Fugger, who was headquartered 总部设在 in Augsberg.

Fugger was financier 财政家；金融家 to the Habsburgs and others.

Megerler said her supernatural 超自然的；神秘的 knowledge had helped him prosper 繁荣；兴旺 in finance 金融；财政, and that he in turn 反过来；轮流 had taught her about crystal ball-gazing 占卜水晶球.

The judges 法官；裁判员 determined 确定；决定 that it would create "complications" 复杂化；并发症 should they proceed further with 继续进行；进一步处理 the inquiry 调查；询问, and her life was spared 饶恕；赦免.

But many women were executed 执行；处死 after being tortured 折磨；拷打 into confessing 坦白；承认 -- and Witches' Hammer strenuously 坚决地；努力地 argued that torture 折磨；拷打 was an appropriate 适当的；恰当的 interrogation 审问；讯问 technique 技术；方法 for potential 潜在的；可能的 witches 女巫.

Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

In around 1624, for instance, the slave 奴隶 and healer 治疗师；巫医 Paula de Eguiluz was tried in Spanish Cuba for witchcraft 巫术；魔法.

It was reported 据报道；据说 that she had killed a child by sucking on her navel 肚脐；脐;

she had also used other skills to devise 设计；发明 a potion 药水；符咒 to help cure 治愈；治疗 her master's 主人 illness 疾病；生病.

Simultaneously 同时地 Paula de Eguiluz knew the Lord's Prayer 主祷文 and Ten Commandments 十诫,

went regularly 经常地；有规律地 to Sunday mass,

and faithfully 忠实地；如实地 made her confession 忏悔；认罪 even as she gained popularity 名望；受欢迎 for her shamanistic 巫师的；萨满教的 healing of people.

The lines between Christianity 基督教 and paganism 异教；非基督教 have never been bright or clear.

The inquisitors 宗教裁判官 in her first hearing 听证会；审讯 condemned 谴责；判刑 her to 200 lashes 鞭打；抽打 and ordered her to perform charitable 慈善的；仁慈的 work.

In her third hearing 听证会；审讯, she fully 完全地；彻底地 confessed 坦白；承认 to being in league with 与…勾结；与…串通 the devil 魔鬼；恶棍 and a witch 女巫 even as she continued to frame 构架；塑造 the use of her African healing knowledge as a Christian act.

By that time she had been convicted 定罪；判罪 and ordered to be sent to government officials 政府官员 for execution 执行；处死 in a move that was cancelled 取消；撤销 only because she had popular 受欢迎的；流行的 support 支持；拥护.

But most women accused of 被指控的；被告发的 witchcraft 巫术；魔法 didn't have the public on their side.

Famously 著名地；出名地, nineteen convicted 定罪的；判罪的 witches 女巫 were hanged 绞死 in the English colony 殖民地 of Salem, Massachusetts, having initially 最初地；起初 been accused by young girls of causing their "fits" 癫痫发作；痉挛.

Others died of torture 折磨；拷打 and imprisonment 监禁；囚禁 in the Americas,

but the majority 大多数；大部分 of trials 审判；试验 and executions 执行；处死 took place in Europe,

where, historians 历史学家 believe, tens of thousands of women were executed 执行；处死 for witchcraft 巫术；魔法 in the 16th and 17th centuries.

Thanks, Thought Bubble.

So, A lying-in-nurse 产婆 -- who took care of mothers and children in the post-pardum 产后的 period 时期；阶段 -- was a common 常见的；普通的 target 目标；对象 for the accusation 指控；控告, because she dealt with 处理；涉及 especially 特别地；尤其 vulnerable 脆弱的；易受伤害的 people: a mother who had just given birth and her newborn 新生的 infant 婴儿；幼儿.

Both had high mortality 死亡率 rates.

And the accused 被指控的；被告发的 were often older women, those who had gone through menopause 更年期；绝经期 and who were sometimes marginalized 使边缘化；忽视 because they could no longer give birth to new community members.

Many were also widowed 守寡的；丧偶的, perhaps isolated 孤立的；隔离的 and without a strong network of support 支持网络.

Once a person was seen as a viable 可行的；切实的 suspect 嫌疑犯；可疑的, she was turned over for torture 折磨；拷打, which was usually carried out by 由…执行；进行 the local hangman 刽子手, who would also hang 绞死 the suspect 嫌疑犯；可疑的 if she were ultimately 最终；最后 found guilty 有罪的；内疚的.

The suspect 嫌疑犯；可疑的 was stripped of clothing, shaved of bodily hair, so that the torturer 施虐者；拷问者 could minutely 仔细地；精密地 examine 检查；审查 the body for all the diabolical 恶魔般的；邪恶的 signs that had come down in lore 传说；知识 and then been codified 编纂；整理成法典 in various 各种各样的 manuals 手册；指南 and books of demonology 恶魔学.

Warts 疣；肉赘, moles 痣；黑子, skin tags 皮赘, hardened 变硬的 nipples 乳头, sagging 下垂的 breasts 乳房, and any purportedly 据称；声称 diabolical 恶魔般的；邪恶的 deformations 畸形；变形 were seen as important evidence 证据；证明.

And I just want to note that these are all things that happen to human bodies naturally 自然地；天生地 over time, so everyone who was older and female could be construed as 被解释为；被理解为 a witch 女巫.

The hangman 刽子手 then applied torture 折磨；拷打 at the direction of 在…的指导下；按照…的指示 a council 委员会；理事会 of examiners 检查员；审查员.

Knowing the accused 被指控的；被告发的 person's body intimately 亲密地；熟悉地, he came to know it better by observing 观察；观测 and noting 注意；记录 the kinds of torture 折磨；拷打 and the victim's 受害者；牺牲品 reaction to each type.

Then as now, many tortured 被折磨的；受拷打的 people would make false confessions 虚假的供述；假认罪, which in turn 反过来；轮流 often led to execution 执行；处死.

The widespread 广泛的；普遍的 torture 折磨；拷打 and execution 执行；处死 are horrifying 令人恐惧的；可怕的, and they speak to 说明；表明 how profoundly 深深地；强烈地 afraid people were of the devil 魔鬼；恶棍 and his influence 影响；作用.

In 1587, the story of Faust, a scholar 学者；知识分子 who sells his soul 灵魂；心灵 to the devil 魔鬼；恶棍, was first published 出版；发行.

And its themes 主题；议题 were relevant 相关的；切题的 to popular 受欢迎的；流行的 and high culture.

Because if a scholar 学者；知识分子 would sell his soul 灵魂；心灵 to the devil 魔鬼；恶棍, who could be immune 免受…影响的；不受…损害的?

It was common knowledge 常识；众所周知的事实 that the devil 魔鬼；恶棍 was a trickster 骗子；诡计多端的人 and a supreme 至高的；极度的 illusionist 魔术师；幻术家, cloaked in 覆盖；笼罩 all kinds of magic that was difficult to detect 察觉；发现 or to separate from 与…分离；区分开 normal, good magic of the unseen world.

So in towns and cities 城市, councils 委员会；理事会 examined 检查；审查 suspects 嫌疑犯；可疑的 often over a period of years, with interrogations 审问；讯问 interspersed 散布；点缀 with torture 折磨；拷打 and deliberations 审议；考虑.

They would examine 检查；审查 a suspect's 嫌疑犯；可疑的 words, the stories she told, and the contradictions 矛盾；不一致 within those stories.

They tried to discern 辨别；识别 who was in league with 与…勾结；与…串通 the devil 魔鬼；恶棍 and who was simply mentally 精神上 disturbed 精神错乱的；心神不安的 or a helpful healer 治疗师；巫医 or, you know, a victim 受害者；牺牲品 of torture 折磨；拷打.

And these councils 委员会；理事会 of notable 著名的；显著的 men always had the last word, leading some historians 历史学家 to believe that in times of difficulty 困难；艰难 and disorder 混乱；骚乱, like the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, men asserted 维护；坚持 control 控制；支配.

Other historians 历史学家 point to 指出；指向 the concentrated 集中的；浓缩的 focus on women and conclude 断定；推断 that the accused 被指控的；被告发的 were the most vulnerable 脆弱的；易受伤害的 and often the most disrespected 不受尊敬的；被轻视的 in society 社会；社团.

Moreover 此外；而且, women such as lying-in-nurses 产婆 dealt with 处理；涉及 the most intimate 最亲密的；私人的 matters of human existence 生存；存在, especially 特别地；尤其 new life, which was then fraught with 充满…的 danger 危险；不安全 -- around half of all infants 婴儿；幼儿 born died before their fifth birthday, many in the first few days of life, and childbirth 分娩；生产 was among the greatest threats 威胁；恐吓 to women's lives.

Finally, others point out that women were the main 主要的；最重要的 victims 受害者；牺牲品 because religious 宗教的 scripture 经文；圣典 referred to 提到；涉及 the female body as the most impure 不纯洁的；污秽的 and most vulnerable 脆弱的；易受伤害的 to evil 邪恶；罪恶.

Being seen as the most unclean 不洁的；肮脏的, they were also seen as the most like the devil 魔鬼；恶棍 -- tricksters 骗子；诡计多端的人 and agents 代理人；代表 of disorder 混乱；骚乱.

The Witches' Hammer makes this comparison 比较；对比 explicit 明确的；清晰的 many, many times.

But no matter what conclusions 结论；推论 you draw, it's important to understand that sexism 性别歧视 isn't just, like, bad in the abstract 抽象的；理论上的.

It is a system of power that oppresses 压迫；欺压 people, and in these cases, many times kills them.

Between 1700 and 1750, the persecution 迫害；残害 of witches 女巫 diminished 减少；减弱, as the tide 潮流；趋势 started to turn against 反对；不利于 the practice 实践；习俗.

French courts 法院 ordered 命令；指示 the arrest 逮捕；拘捕 of witch-hunters 搜捕女巫者 and the release 释放；放开 of suspected 被怀疑的；可疑的 witches 女巫.

In 1682, a French royal decree 王室法令 treated 对待；处理 witchcraft 巫术；魔法 as a fraud 欺诈；诈骗.

Perhaps the state had taken seriously Michel de Montaigne's pronouncement 声明；宣告 from a century earlier -- almost unique 独特的；独一无二的 at the time, by the way: "it is taking one's conjectures 推测；猜测 rather seriously 严肃地；认真地 to roast 烤；炙 someone alive 活着的 for them."

By 1700, people had a more positive 积极的；乐观的 view of the divine 神圣的；神的 and had relaxed 放松；缓和 their view that the Devil's hand was at work in everyday life or in natural disasters 自然灾害.

Although some religious 宗教的 authorities 权威；权力机构 might still see misfortune 不幸；灾祸 as the work of the Devil, others had a better understanding that there were scientific 科学的；系统的 laws behind the operations 运作；操作 of nature 自然；本性.

More than that, the worst of the multifaceted 多方面的；多层面的 religious 宗教的 and political 政治的；政府的 turmoil 混乱；骚动 was over and questions of political 政治的；政府的 order 秩序；治安 seemed less menacing 威胁的；险恶的.

We'll discuss 讨论；论述 how these new understandings came about in the next few episodes.

Thanks for watching.

I'll see you then.

== 中文释义


大家好，我是约翰·格林，这里是《速成欧洲史》。

在本系列的第一集，我们谈到了1431年的重要性。
还记得吗？那一年，圣女贞德（Joan of Arc）因异端和巫术罪被处以火刑——英国人对一个十几岁的农家女孩竟能率领法军获胜深感困惑，认定她必是女巫和异端。
说真的，一个普通农家女孩在一段时间内成为15世纪最重要战争中最重要的将军，这确实令人困惑。
不过需要明确的是：圣女贞德不是女巫。

但正如她曾受益于关于“神秘力量女性”的迷信和预言，她最终也因人们对巫术和黑魔法的恐惧而被摧毁。

在贞德受审和处决后的一个世纪里，世界因过去四集讨论的宗教改革、商业与农业革命、反宗教改革而天翻地覆，社会、经济、政治和宗教结构均以各自的方式受到冲击。
也许“女巫”能解释这种动荡。

在欧洲历史的大部分时期，乃至世界历史的大部分时期，人们相信无形的力量在掌控世界和个人生活。
自然界的物体可能具有治愈或毒害作用，以未知的方式运作。例如，伊丽莎白女王（Queen Elizabeth）曾收到一枚据称能抵御瘟疫的戒指。
大多数城镇都有萨满、“智者”（男女皆有）、巫师或其他懂得药水、膏药和符咒的居民。
看，伊丽莎白女王从未染上瘟疫，因此人们很容易得出结论：至少有时，这些东西是有效的！
正如一位主教在1552年所写：“当我们陷入困境、疾病或丢失物品时，我们四处奔波寻找女巫或巫师（我们称之为‘智者’），向他们寻求帮助和安慰。”

其他“智者”能利用日食、太阳黑子、彗星和各种自然现象预测未来重大事件。例如，1648年伊斯坦布尔的地震 tremors 被认为预示了两个月后苏丹遇刺。
印刷机大量出版的书籍中广泛描绘了这些萨满、算命者和特殊治疗者——书中故事往往偏离现实。
读者似乎对女巫的故事津津乐道：她们特殊的巫术仪式、滑稽冒险、性行为反常，以及对无辜者的攻击（和腐化）。

让·博丹（Jean Bodin）是著名且有影响力的法学家，在这个“新君主制”和政府集权的时代，他撰写了关于“主权”（即国家权力与权威的本质）的著作。
他还以vernacular 撰写关于女巫和魔鬼学的著作，使更多人能接触到他的作品。
提及博丹很重要，因为他的作品凸显了在16至17世纪，高尚的政府政治理论与日常的“女巫世界”并存。
我认为这是历史中最大的“共情障碍”之一——我们很难想象一个几乎普遍认为“上帝与魔鬼之手始终在左右大小事件”的世界。
但人类的一个矛盾之处在于，我们对生活中的“运气”或“命运”（无论你如何称呼）始终存在困惑，而我们都渴望生活成为一个“有意义的故事”。
说“一切发生皆有因”是一种方式，说“都是女巫干的”则是另一种。
从某种意义上说，历史本身就是试图讲述一个“有意义的故事”——我们试图在无穷复杂的力量、选择和运气构成的网络中寻找叙事逻辑。
希望这样的思考能帮助你产生一些共情。

回到女巫的话题：艺术是我们窥见巫术的另一个窗口。
在宏大的巴洛克绘画中，你能看到魔鬼、毒蛇、老巫婆和其他邪恶象征在社会中蔓延。例如，鲁本斯（Rubens）的巨幅画作《新月上的圣母》（Madonna on the Crescent Moon）陈列在弗赖辛大教堂（Cathedral of Freising）的祭坛上，画面左三分之一满是魔鬼、 demons 和罪恶之蛇，供教区居民“瞻仰”。
鲁本斯为玛丽·德·美第奇（Marie de Medici）生平创作的庆祝作品《众神会议》（Council of the Gods）中，最右侧也描绘了一个类似女巫的人物。
值得注意的是，鲁本斯的创作素材来自早已存在的魔鬼和女巫的黑白版画（常见于大幅报纸和书籍中）。由此可见，关于女巫的想象早已泛滥。

但这些想象究竟从何而来？
《圣经》对女巫着墨不多，但《出埃及记》22:18有一句名言：“不可容女巫存活。”
然而，流行文化借鉴了异教神话，其中充满狡猾的女巫和使用爱情药水与符咒施魔法的 enchantresses。
人们看到女巫飞行的木刻版画，或听说魔法师乘飞毯或飞衣的故事，或去看治疗师却意外死亡。
但我们再次寻求“有意义的故事”：一个拿着药水的治疗师，似乎也有可能持有毒药或危险药水——这种逻辑看似合理。

于是，《圣经》中的几句经文、中世纪逐渐增多的恐怖故事，加上海因里希·克拉默（Heinrich Kramer）1487年的《女巫之锤》（Witches' Hammer, Malleus Malificarum）登场了。
克拉默是多明我会修士，他的书惊人地流行——一个多世纪里，它是欧洲第二畅销书，仅次于《圣经》。书中称，由于“末日审判即将到来”，撒旦“在主的土地上引发了一种异常的异端邪说——我要说，这是‘女巫的异端’，因为撒旦已知对该性别（女性）拥有权力”。
该书详细描述了这些（大多为女性的）巫术从业者的诸多恶行，并主张对她们发起全面战争。
如今看来，克拉默的书堪称激进的厌女奇幻小说——他写道，女性“灵魂与身体的所有能力均有缺陷”，并声称女巫除其他罪行外，还施行食人行为并导致男性阳痿。
当然，如果你拥有魔力，“滥用魔力”似乎就该是这样的“操作”。

但在当时，《女巫之锤》影响力巨大。该书最初获得宗教当局认可，后又被否决。但随着欧洲人接触异教习俗，克拉默的巫术宣言为他们提供了新的“认知框架”。
在宗教、经济和社会挑战交织的动荡世纪中，猎巫行动加速并变得致命。
必须理解的是，在16世纪许多基督徒眼中，“巫术”是真实存在的威胁。

世界中心又“打开”了吗？里面有只黑猫？
哦，这肯定是要插播公益广告了。
大家好！我是约翰·格林。这不是一只邪恶的猫！它只是一只普通的好猫，只是恰好有一身黑色毛发。不要对黑猫有偏见，它们是很棒的猫！
这只其实是假的，因为斯坦说我不能把真猫放进地球仪里。斯坦！
但重点不是这个。重点是：黑猫不是厄运的象征，也不参与巫术，它们是很棒的猫——如果斯坦让我用真猫，它会是只很棒的猫。

1560年起，欧洲各地城乡开始出现一系列所谓的“恶魔事件”，随之而来的是大规模迫害。1560年至1800年间，欧洲约有5万至10万人因巫术受审。
与圣女贞德不同，大多数被指控为“女巫”的人与那些年的宏大动荡事件几乎无关。和贞德一样，绝大多数（约80%）是女性，且许多人被处决。
这些年几乎所有主要的魔鬼学著作均由德国出版商以德语或拉丁语出版——因此，神圣罗马帝国成为猎巫的主要中心之一。

1564年，德国南部城市奥格斯堡（Augsberg）的市政议会法官审讯了治疗师安娜·梅格勒（Anna Megerler），因为她照料的一名男孩因伤口感染死亡。
在严刑逼供下，梅格勒称她曾向驻奥格斯堡的安东·富格尔（Anton Fugger）传授秘密知识。富格尔是哈布斯堡家族及其他势力的 financier。
梅格勒说，她的超自然知识帮助富格尔在金融领域 prosper，而富格尔则教她用水晶球占卜。
法官认定若进一步调查会“引发复杂后果”，梅格勒因此保住性命。但许多女性在被折磨至“认罪”后被处决——《女巫之锤》极力主张，酷刑是审讯“潜在女巫”的合适手段。

让我们进入“思想泡泡”环节。
例如，1624年左右，西班牙殖民地古巴的奴隶兼治疗师保拉·德·埃吉卢兹（Paula de Eguiluz）因巫术受审。据指控，她通过吮吸婴儿肚脐致其死亡，还利用其他“技能”配制药水治愈主人的疾病。
与此同时，保拉·德·埃吉卢兹会背诵《主祷文》和《十诫》，定期参加周日弥撒，即便因萨满式治疗广受欢迎，仍忠实地忏悔。
基督教与异教的界限从未清晰明确。
审讯者在第一次听证会上判处她200鞭刑，并命令她从事慈善工作。在第三次听证会上，她“全面认罪”，承认与魔鬼结盟并施行巫术，同时仍将自己使用的非洲治疗知识描述为“基督教行为”。
那时她已被定罪，政府本打算将其处决，只因她有民众支持才取消。但大多数被指控为女巫的女性没有这样的公众支持。
著名的是，在马萨诸塞州塞勒姆（Salem）的英国殖民地，19名被定罪的“女巫”被处以绞刑——最初是年轻女孩指控她们导致自己“抽搐”。
在美洲，其他人因酷刑和监禁死亡，但大多数审判和处决发生在欧洲。历史学家认为，16至17世纪，数万女性因巫术在欧洲被处决。

感谢“思想泡泡”。

“接生护士”（负责照料产后母婴的女性）是常见的指控目标，因为她们接触的是特别脆弱的人群——刚分娩的母亲和新生儿，两者的死亡率均很高。
被指控者通常是年长女性，她们已绝经，有时因无法再为社区生育新成员而被边缘化。许多人也是寡妇，可能孤立无援。
一旦某人被视为“可疑对象”，就会被移交施刑——酷刑通常由当地刽子手执行，若最终定罪，刽子手也会执行绞刑。
嫌疑人会被剥光衣服、剃去体毛，以便施刑者仔细检查身体，寻找传说中、并被各种魔鬼学手册和书籍“法典化”的“恶魔标志”。
疣、痣、皮赘、硬化的乳头、下垂的乳房，以及任何所谓的“恶魔般的畸形”都被视为重要证据。
我只想指出，这些都是人体随时间自然出现的特征，因此所有年长女性都可能被指认为女巫。
刽子手在“审讯委员会”的指示下施行酷刑。他通过观察和记录酷刑类型及受害者的反应，“深入了解”受害者的身体。
古今皆然，许多受刑者会做出虚假供述，进而导致处决。
大规模的酷刑和处决令人震惊，也反映了人们对魔鬼及其影响力的深深恐惧。

1587年，学者浮士德（Faust）向魔鬼出卖灵魂的故事首次出版，其主题在大众文化和高雅文化中均引起共鸣。
如果学者都会向魔鬼出卖灵魂，谁又能免疫？
众所周知，魔鬼是骗子和至高的幻术师，藏身于各种难以察觉的魔法中，而这些魔法很难与无形世界的“正常善意魔法”区分。
因此在城镇中，议会往往耗时数年审查嫌疑人，审讯中穿插酷刑和“ deliberations ”。他们审视嫌疑人的言辞、讲述的故事及其中的矛盾，试图分辨谁与魔鬼结盟，谁只是精神障碍患者、助人的治疗师，或单纯的酷刑受害者。
这些由“显贵男性”组成的议会拥有最终决定权。这让一些历史学家认为，在16至17世纪这样的困难和混乱时期，男性通过猎巫assert 控制权。
另一些历史学家则指出，指控集中于女性，说明被告是社会中最脆弱、最不受尊重的群体。
此外，像接生护士这样的女性从事与人类生存最私密的事务（尤其是新生生命），而生育在当时充满危险——约一半婴儿活不过五岁，许多在出生后几天内夭折，分娩也是女性生命的最大威胁之一。
最后，还有人指出，女性成为主要受害者是因为宗教经文将女性身体视为“最不洁、最易受邪恶侵蚀”。
被视为“最不洁净”的她们，也被视为“最像魔鬼”——骗子和混乱的代理人。《女巫之锤》多次明确做出这种类比。

但无论你得出何种结论，重要的是要明白：性别歧视不仅是“抽象的坏事”，更是压迫性的权力体系，在这些案例中，它多次致人死亡。

1700年至1750年间，随着舆论开始反对猎巫，对女巫的迫害逐渐减少。法国法院下令逮捕猎巫者并释放“嫌疑女巫”。1682年，法国一项皇家法令将巫术视为欺诈。
或许国家认真对待了米歇尔·德·蒙田（Michel de Montaigne）一个世纪前的宣言（顺便说，这在当时几乎是“独树一帜”的观点）：“因个人猜测而将人活活烤死，未免把猜测看得太重了。”
到1700年，人们对“神性”有了更积极的看法，不再轻易认为魔鬼之手在日常生活或自然灾害中作祟。尽管一些宗教当局可能仍将不幸视为“魔鬼的杰作”，但另一些人已更清楚地认识到，自然运作背后有科学规律。
更重要的是，多重宗教和政治动荡最严重的时期已经结束，政治秩序问题似乎不再那么可怕。
我们将在接下来的几集讨论这些新认知如何形成。

感谢观看，下期见。

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.
So, in the first episode of this series, we talked about the significance of the year 1431.

Remember, that was the year Joan of Arc was burned to death for heresy and witchcraft because the English were so bewildered that a teenage peasant girl could lead the French army to victory that they decided she had to be a witch and a heretic.

And, you know, it was pretty bewildering that a random peasant girl somehow basically became for a time the most important general in the most important war of the fifteenth century.

That said, just to state the obvious: Joan of Arc was not a witch.

But just as she benefited from superstitions and prophecies about mystically powerful women, she was ultimately destroyed by fears of witchcraft and dark magic.

For the past four episodes, the world has been turned upside down in the century after Joan's trial and execution.

The Reformation, Commercial and Agricultural Revolutions, and Counter-Reformation were each in their own way shaking social, and economic, and political, and religious structures.

Perhaps some witches could explain that turmoil.

So, for most of European history, and indeed for most of world history, people believed in unseen powers that operated across their world and in their individual lives.

Objects from nature could be healing or poisonous, working in unknown ways.

Like, Queen Elizabeth once received a ring that was supposed to protect her from the plague.

Most towns had shamans, a "wise" man or woman, a wizard, a sorcerer, or another resident who knew about potions, and poultices, and charms.

And look, Queen Elizabeth never got the plague, so it was easy to conclude that sometimes, at least, this stuff worked!

As one bishop wrote in 1552, "When we be in trouble, or sickness, or lose anything, we run hither and thither to witches or sorcerers, whom we call wise men, . . . seeking aid and comfort at their hands."

Other wise men could use eclipses, or sunspots, or comets and various natural phenomena to predict momentous future events.

Like, earthquake tremors in Istanbul in 1648 for instance, were said to foretell the murder of the sultan two months later.

All these shamans, and fortune tellers, and special healers were widely depicted in the many books now streaming from the printing press -- with stories that often strayed from reality.

The reading public seemed to revel in tales of witches: their special witches' rites, their antics and adventures, their sexual perversions, and their attacks on (and corruption of) the innocent.

Jean Bodin was a famed and influential jurist who wrote about sovereignty -- that is, the nature of state power and authority -- in this age of new monarchy and governmental consolidation.

He also famously wrote about witches and demonology in the vernacular so that a large group would have access to his pieces.

And I think it's important to note Bodin because his work underscores that in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries high-minded political theory of government and the everyday world of witches co-existed.

I think this can be one of the great empathy barriers in history -- it can be hard for some of us to imagine a world where it was almost universally assumed that the hand of God and the hand of the Devil were constantly shaping events both large and small.

But one of the discomforting things about humanity is the role luck or fate or however you consider it plays in our lives, and we all have a desire for life to be a story that makes sense.

Saying "Everything happens for a reason" is one way of doing that; saying, "Witches did it" is another.

In some ways, history itself is an attempt to tell a story that makes sense -- we're trying to find narratives amid an endlessly complicated web of forces and choices and luck.

So I hope thinking about that can help you empathize a bit.

But back to witches: Art is another place we see a lot of witchcraft.

In grand baroque paintings, you can find devils, serpents, old hags, and other signs of evil filtering across society.

Like, in Rubens' massive painting "Madonna on the Crescent Moon," featured at the altar of the Cathedral of Freising, the entire left third displays devils, and demons, and the serpent of sin for parishioners.

And "Council of the Gods," one of Rubens' celebratory works on the life of Marie de Medici, depicts a witch-like figure at the extreme right.

And it's important to note that Rubens was working from images that had already been around for a long time, in the form of black and white engravings of the devil and witches in broadsheets and books.

So we know ideas about witches were plentiful.

But where did they actually originate?

The Bible doesn't say much about them, though there is this prominent statement in Exodus 22:18: "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."

Popular culture, however, drew on pagan mythology, full of wily sorceresses and enchantresses using love potions and charms to work their magic.

And people saw woodcuts of witches in flight or they heard about magicians on flying coats or carpets or they went to healers and unexpectedly died.

But again, we look for stories that make sense, and it makes sense that a healer with their medicinal potions, might also have access to poisonous or other dangerous potions.

So there were a few lines from the Bible, a growing collection of scary stories through the Middle Ages, and then came Heinrich Kramer's Witches' Hammer (Malleus Malificarum) in 1487.

Kramer was a Dominican monk whose book was amazingly popular -- for over a century, it was the second bestselling book in Europe behind only the Bible, and the book argues that Satan, due to the fact the Apocalypse is coming, has "caused a certain unusual heretical perversity to grow up in the land of the Lord -- a heresy, I say, of Sorceresses, since it is to be designated by the particular gender of which he [Satan] is known to have power."

The book goes on to describe in detail the many evils of these mostly female practitioners of witchcraft, and to advocate all-out war against them.

These days, Kramer's book reads like aggressively misogynistic fantasy fiction -- he writes that women are "defective in all the powers of both soul and body" and claims that witches were, among many other things, practicing cannibalism and causing male impotence.

Because of course if you have magical powers, that's how you're going to use them.

But at the time, Witches' Hammer was tremendously influential.

The book was first approved, then disapproved by religious authorities.

But as Europeans engaged with pagan practices, Kramer's witchcraft manifesto gave them a new context.

Amid the religious, economic, and social challenges of these stressful centuries, the hunt for witches accelerated and became lethal.

It's really important to understand that the idea of witchcraft felt to many Christians in the sixteenth century like a real threat.

Did the center of the world just open?

Is there a black cat in there?

Oh, it must be time for a PSA.

Hi!

I'm John Green.

This is not an evil cat!

It's just a regular nice cat that happens to have one color of fur.

Don't be mean to these cats.

These are great cats!

This one happens to be fake because Stan said I couldn't put a real cat inside the globe.

Stan!

But that's not the point.

The point is that this cat is not bad luck.

It is not involved in witchcraft.

It is a great cat.

Or, it would have been a great cat if Stan had let me use a real cat.

So, beginning in 1560 in villages and cities across Europe, a stream of supposedly demonic incidents took place and a raft of persecutions followed.

Between 1560 and 1800, between 50,000 to 100,000 people were tried for witchcraft in the European world.

Unlike Joan of Arc, most purported witches had little to do with the grand and tumultuous events of those years.

Like Joan, the vast majority -- approximately 80 percent -- were women.

And like Joan, many were executed.

Almost all major works of demonology during these years were published in German or in Latin with a German publisher -- the Holy Roman Empire therefore was one major center of the hunt for witches.

In 1564, judges for the town council of Augsberg, a city in the south of the German empire, questioned the healer Anna Megerler when a boy she had cared for died of a wound.

While being intensely grilled, Megerler said that she had taught secret knowledge to the mighty Anton Fugger, who was headquartered in Augsberg.

Fugger was financier to the Habsburgs and others.

Megerler said her supernatural knowledge had helped him prosper in finance, and that he in turn had taught her about crystal ball-gazing.

The judges determined that it would create "complications" should they proceed further with the inquiry, and her life was spared.

But many women were executed after being tortured into confessing -- and Witches' Hammer strenuously argued that torture was an appropriate interrogation technique for potential witches.

Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

In around 1624, for instance, the slave and healer Paula de Eguiluz was tried in Spanish Cuba for witchcraft.
It was reported that she had killed a child by sucking on her navel;
she had also used other skills to devise a potion to help cure her master's illness.
Simultaneously Paula de Eguiluz knew the Lord's Prayer and Ten Commandments,
went regularly to Sunday mass,
and faithfully made her confession even as she gained popularity for her shamanistic healing of people.
The lines between Christianity and paganism have never been bright or clear.
The inquisitors in her first hearing condemned her to 200 lashes and ordered her to perform charitable work.
In her third hearing, she fully confessed to being in league with the devil and a witch even as she continued to frame the use of her African healing knowledge as a Christian act.
By that time she had been convicted and ordered to be sent to government officials for execution in a move that was cancelled only because she had popular support.
But most women accused of witchcraft didn't have the public on their side.
Famously, nineteen convicted witches were hanged in the English colony of Salem, Massachusetts, having initially been accused by young girls of causing their "fits."
Others died of torture and imprisonment in the Americas,
but the majority of trials and executions took place in Europe,
where, historians believe, tens of thousands of women were executed for witchcraft in the 16th and 17th centuries.
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

So, A lying-in-nurse -- who took care of mothers and children in the post-pardum period -- was a common target for the accusation, because she dealt with especially vulnerable people: a mother who had just given birth and her newborn infant.

Both had high mortality rates.

And the accused were often older women, those who had gone through menopause and who were sometimes marginalized because they could no longer give birth to new community members.

Many were also widowed, perhaps isolated and without a strong network of support.

Once a person was seen as a viable suspect, she was turned over for torture, which was usually carried out by the local hangman, who would also hang the suspect if she were ultimately found guilty.

The suspect was stripped of clothing, shaved of bodily hair, so that the torturer could minutely examine the body for all the diabolical signs that had come down in lore and then been codified in various manuals and books of demonology.

Warts, moles, skin tags, hardened nipples, sagging breasts, and any purportedly diabolical deformations were seen as important evidence.

And I just want to note that these are all things that happen to human bodies naturally over time, so everyone who was older and female could be construed as a witch.

The hangman then applied torture at the direction of a council of examiners.

Knowing the accused person's body intimately, he came to know it better by observing and noting the kinds of torture and the victim's reaction to each type.

Then as now, many tortured people would make false confessions, which in turn often led to execution.

The widespread torture and execution are horrifying, and they speak to how profoundly afraid people were of the devil and his influence.

In 1587, the story of Faust, a scholar who sells his soul to the devil, was first published.

And its themes were relevant to popular and high culture.

Because if a scholar would sell his soul to the devil, who could be immune?

It was common knowledge that the devil was a trickster and a supreme illusionist, cloaked in all kinds of magic that was difficult to detect or to separate from the normal, good magic of the unseen world.

So in towns and cities, councils examined suspects often over a period of years, with interrogations interspersed with torture and deliberations.

They would examine a suspect's words, the stories she told, and the contradictions within those stories.

They tried to discern who was in league with the devil and who was simply mentally disturbed or a helpful healer or, you know, a victim of torture.

And these councils of notable men always had the last word, leading some historians to believe that in times of difficulty and disorder, like the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, men asserted control.

Other historians point to the concentrated focus on women and conclude that the accused were the most vulnerable and often the most disrespected in society.

Moreover, women such as lying-in-nurses dealt with the most intimate matters of human existence, especially new life, which was then fraught with danger -- around half of all infants born died before their fifth birthday, many in the first few days of life, and childbirth was among the greatest threats to women's lives.

Finally, others point out that women were the main victims because religious scripture referred to the female body as the most impure and most vulnerable to evil.

Being seen as the most unclean, they were also seen as the most like the devil -- tricksters and agents of disorder.

The Witches' Hammer makes this comparison explicit many, many times.

But no matter what conclusions you draw, it's important to understand that sexism isn't just, like, bad in the abstract.

It is a system of power that oppresses people, and in these cases, many times kills them.

Between 1700 and 1750, the persecution of witches diminished, as the tide started to turn against the practice.

French courts ordered the arrest of witch-hunters and the release of suspected witches.

In 1682, a French royal decree treated witchcraft as a fraud.

Perhaps the state had taken seriously Michel de Montaigne's pronouncement from a century earlier -- almost unique at the time, by the way: "it is taking one's conjectures rather seriously to roast someone alive for them."

By 1700, people had a more positive view of the divine and had relaxed their view that the Devil's hand was at work in everyday life or in natural disasters.

Although some religious authorities might still see misfortune as the work of the Devil, others had a better understanding that there were scientific laws behind the operations of nature.

More than that, the worst of the multifaceted religious and political turmoil was over and questions of political order seemed less menacing.

We'll discuss how these new understandings came about in the next few episodes.

Thanks for watching.

I'll see you then.
