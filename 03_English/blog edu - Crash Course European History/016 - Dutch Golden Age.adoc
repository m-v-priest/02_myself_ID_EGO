== 释义

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

So in the last episode, we saw the gentry 绅士 and merchant class 商人阶级 of the British Isles 不列颠群岛 defeat the old aristocrat-backed 由贵族支持的, absolutist monarchy 专制君主制 in the Glorious Revolution 光荣革命, ushering in 迎来 a constitutional government 立宪政府.

And this points to 表明 a wider development in European history -- and for that matter 就此而言 world history.

So, we've talked a lot in this series about being able to shift perspectives 转变视角 -- to see things from royal perspectives 王室视角, or from peasant perspectives 农民视角, and so on.

But students of history must also learn how to shift the lenses 视角 through which they look at the past.

Like, we might look at the past through the lens of food availability 食物供应情况, or through the lens of visual art 视觉艺术, or through the lens of Marxist theory 马克思主义理论, and so on.

And the lenses we choose are often about our present concerns 当前关注的问题.

The way that we look at the past changes over time, as the present changes.

And in the present where I'm currently standing, one of the big questions is how to distribute power 分配权力 among humans.

So today, we're going to look at history through the lens of power -- by which I mean, who gets to decide the ambitions and priorities 目标和优先事项 of a community, and we'll see how the distribution of that power can change over time.

[Intro]
So, in the early modern period 近代早期 monarchs 君主 could coordinate national defense 协调国防, and they could try to collect taxes 征税 and even try to impose 强加 their religious beliefs on their communities.

But increasingly over time, economic activity 经济活动 was driven and controlled by the so-called productive classes 生产阶级 -- land-owning gentry 拥有土地的绅士 who were producing more food per acre 每英亩 thanks to the agricultural revolution 农业革命, and merchants 商人 who were making money due to expanding trade 贸易扩张 and imperialism 帝国主义.

These classes held the key to government finances 政府财政, because they were the ones with the money and land and goods that could be taxed, which then -- as now -- meant that they had power to sway governments 影响政府.

And in many cases, these productive classes used this power to give themselves a say in 对…有发言权 the running of their country through advocating for 倡导 a constitutional government that could keep the monarchy in check 制衡君主制.

We see this especially in Dutch history, where these classes brought about 带来 constitutionalism 立宪主义 and created what has come to be known as the Dutch Golden Age 荷兰黄金时代.

It'll last forever: just like all golden ages.

So, like British reformers 改革者, the Dutch had an active business class 商业阶层, who were backing 支持 the struggle for independence from Spain.

This struggle involved the seven northern provinces of the Low Countries 低地国家 allying with 与…结盟 the ten southern provinces after 1576 to defeat the Spanish in the Eighty Years War 八十年战争 (also known as the Dutch revolts 荷兰起义 or the Dutch War of Independence 荷兰独立战争 or I suppose the Spanish probably thought of it as Our Northern Province's Illegal War of Secession 非法分裂战争.

It all depends on who's telling the story.

But anyway, by the end of the sixteenth century the United Provinces of the low countries had become functionally independent 实际上独立 from Spain, though it wasn't formalized 正式确定 until 1648 in the Treaty of Westphalia 威斯特伐利亚和约.

The southern provinces spun off 分离出去 to constitute 组成 Belgium, Luxembourg, and parts of northern France, while the seven northern provinces became the Netherlands.

Each province of the Dutch Republic 荷兰共和国 had a regent 摄政 who oversaw provincial affairs 管理省级事务, while as a group they participated in the States General 荷兰议会, a kind of council of representatives 代表委员会 from each province, which in turn 反过来 chose a single executive 行政长官, known as the stadtholder 执政, or stadtholder.

Or probably somewhere halfway in between those that only Dutch people can say.

We'll say Stadtholder.

Anyway, all in all 总的来说, this was a fairly loose confederation of states 松散的邦联, and they often had competing interests 利益冲突.

Like, Holland, on the one hand 一方面, was the most prosperous 繁荣的 and contributed the most to the overall finances 整体财政 of the group.

It was commercially-oriented 以商业为导向的 and generally favored peace over war 宁愿和平不愿战争.

On the other side 另一方面 were provinces like Zeeland whose privateers 私掠船 seized ships during the chaos of warfare 战争混乱期间夺取船只 and were therefore somewhat less opposed to it.

Calvinist clergymen 加尔文派牧师 favored war against Catholic Spain and some pamphleteers 小册子作者 simply liked war because "it caused all industry and trade to grow and prosper."[1] Which is a bit of an oversimplification 过于简单化.

Although, whether war is good for business 对商业有益 is one of the big questions of history.

It's definitely not great for people, though, which I would argue are possibly even more important than businesses?

There was also disagreement among the provinces about the role of the stadtholder: Should the Stadtholder become more of a monarchical figure 君主角色, or should the United Provinces continue to function as a kind of republic?

So we're talking here about big differences about fundamental matters 基本问题, like war and peace and how power should be distributed within the confederation 邦联.

And these differences prevented the kind of focused central government 集中的中央政府 that England built after its Glorious Revolution.

But nonetheless 尽管如此, the States General had greater unity in economic policy 经济政策 -- that is in its strategy for backing trade 支持贸易的策略 -- than the English did, whose conservative aristocracy 保守的贵族 were always battling the commercial classes 商业阶层 both before and after the English civil war 英国内战.

So despite a measure of political disunity 政治不统一, the Dutch Republic prospered 繁荣 in the seventeenth century and in spite of warfare 尽管有战争, it actually became a comparatively tolerant state 相对宽容的国家.

In fact its prosperity made it a kind of mecca 圣地 for all sorts of artisans 工匠 and business people who wanted to participate in Dutch hustle and bustle 热闹繁忙的商业活动.

[[TV: BARUCH SPINOZA]] The republic became a center of printing for people whose thoughts had been censored 审查 elsewhere.

For instance, philosopher Baruch Spinoza denied the immortality of the soul 灵魂不朽 and didn't believe in a transcendent deity 超验的神.

Those were pretty radical ideas 激进的思想 in 17th century Europe, and in fact, Spinoza was banished from 被逐出 his Jewish congregation 犹太教会 in his early twenties, but he continued his philosophical labors 哲学研究, and he was able to continue publishing.

It's also worth noting that, like most philosophers, Spinoza did have a day job 日常工作 -- he ground lenses 研磨镜片 for microscopes and telescopes.

Meaning that he was very good at shifting historical lenses 转变历史视角.

I feel like I should apologize to my friends and family for that joke.

Except.

That I'm not sorry.

But Spinoza's Portuguese Jewish ancestors 祖先 had settled in Amsterdam in the sixteenth century, and Jewish people from Spain also migrated north 向北迁移 to escape persecution 迫害 by Isabella and Ferdinand and their royal descendants 王室后裔.

Pilgrims 清教徒 and many other religious non-conformists 宗教异见者 also went to the Netherlands, as did many Huguenots 胡格诺派教徒 after the French revocation of the Edict of Nantes 废除南特敕令 in 1685.

The citizens of the Dutch Republic were among the most diverse 多样化的 in Europe at the time, and that contributed to 促成 the Netherlands prosperity 繁荣.

So thriving businesses 繁荣的企业 arose at the time, especially ones deriving from 源自 the early maritime networks 海上贸易网络 its merchants had developed in Japan, Southeast Asia, and the New World late in the sixteenth century.

Cornelis Matelieff de Jonge was one person who saw overseas trade 海外贸易 as key to advancing overall Dutch prosperity 促进荷兰整体繁荣.

Along with other military men and adventurers 冒险家, embarked on 着手；开始做 securing the spice trade 控制香料贸易 for the Netherlands.

This largely involved expanding trade networks with present day Indonesia.

Matelieff de Jonge wrote a book called *Discourse on the State and Trade of the Indies* that described the Indonesian islands and the broader southern oceanic region 南部海洋地区, and the Dutch government took notice of 注意到 the riches promised by the spice trade 香料贸易带来的财富, so they authorized 授权 the creation of trading companies whose military forces didn't just take territory 占领领土, but also sought to advance trade 促进贸易, at times acquiring goods or establishing trade routes via force or the threat of it 通过武力或威胁获取货物或建立贸易路线.

These Indian Ocean trade networks 印度洋贸易网络 were highly developed 高度发达, and Europeans were new to them, and relatively inexperienced 缺乏经验.

Especially the Dutch.

The Spanish and Portuguese had been at it for more than a century.

And so despite armed trading companies 武装贸易公司, gaining the upper hand in trade 占据贸易优势 took the Dutch generations, although they would use alliances with local leaders 与当地领导人结盟 and military might 军事力量 to become imperialist powers 帝国主义列强 in time 最终, and eventually extract far more than they invested in the well-being of colonies 从殖民地获取远超投入的利益.

But before all that, Holland's merchants began bringing back an array of 一系列 plants and commodities 商品, which stimulated innovation 刺激创新, while its geographic positioning 地理位置 enabled its ships to access north-south and east-west trade routes 贸易路线.

And as English merchants and leaders became wrapped up in 陷入 decades of political disputes 政治争端 and lethal combat 致命冲突 among themselves, the Dutch began to outperform them in trade 在贸易上超越他们.

Soon the Dutch had replaced the Portuguese as the primary Atlantic slave traders 主要的大西洋奴隶贩子, although the English would eventually overtake them 超过他们.

But by the middle of the 17th Century, the center of economic activity 经济活动中心 in Europe had migrated from the Mediterranean and Italian city-states 意大利城邦, north.

The Dutch were thriving 蓬勃发展.

Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

The Dutch took advantage of 利用 their independence
and reduced war expenses 战争开支 by
expanding their shipping capacity 航运能力 and
building a network of canals 运河网络 connecting 400 miles of major cities
which improved communication and trade regionally 促进地区交流和贸易.
Amsterdam flourished 繁荣,
growing to over 200,000 people by late in the century.
And as it grew, land reclamation 土地开垦 and civil engineering 土木工程 advanced,
along with the now-famous design of Amsterdam's houses,
many of which are still standing 仍然屹立.
In fact, I lived in a 17th century Dutch home while writing *The Fault in Our Stars*.
But speaking of innovation 创新, Dutch painter and inventor Jan Van der Heyden devised 发明 a long-burning wick 长燃灯芯,
which brought cities nighttime illumination 夜间照明
and a reduction in crime 减少犯罪.
He also created portable pumping devices 便携式抽水设备 to extinguish fires 灭火,
which drastically reduced the destructive power of urban fires 城市火灾破坏力 beginning in the seventeenth century.
Meanwhile Dutch artists, including Van der Heyden, excelled in 擅长 painting some relatively new portrait subjects 肖像画题材:
common people 普通人,
and their everyday lives and domestic interiors 家庭内部,
and the commodities 商品 that increasingly filled their homes.
Many of these commodities came from distant lands
and included Chinese porcelain 瓷器, Middle Eastern carpets, and imported textiles 纺织品.
In addition, the paintings of Johannes Vermeer,
alongside those of Van der Heyden,
featured maps and globes 地图和地球仪,
testifying to 证明 the cosmopolitanism 世界主义 of the middle and upper classes 中上层阶级.
But even ordinary workers in Dutch cities might have a painting and books for intellectual and visual nourishment 精神和视觉享受,
which was a stark contrast from 与…形成鲜明对比 just a century or two earlier.
Thanks Thought Bubble.

So with the Dutch now commanding trade 主导贸易 in a way that the English could not, Oliver Cromwell's government sought to take back control of the seas 重新控制海洋 with the Navigation Act of 1651 1651年航海条例.

It mandated 强制规定 the use of English ships for any goods using English ports, whether in Britain itself or in its colonies 殖民地.

This was one example of legislated mercantilism 重商主义立法.

Now, we've mentioned this before, but mercantilist theory 重商主义理论 sees the global economy as finite 有限的.

We now understand that the size of the global economy's overall pie 全球经济总量 can get bigger and smaller, but at the time Mercantilist theory saw the overall economy as stagnant 停滞的, which meant to become wealthier, you had to take wealth from other places.

Tariffs 关税 for instance, were a common feature of mercantilism -- with a finite economic pie 有限的经济总量, a nation should only export goods 出口商品 and take in gold for them; it should never buy foreign goods because that would mean losing wealth to a competing nation 竞争对手.

Now, this obviously happened most dramatically in colonized regions 殖民地区, but it also happened within Europe, as nations sought to take wealth and possessions from one another 相互掠夺财富和财产.

Three separate times between 1652 and 1674, the English provoked warfare 挑起战争 with the Dutch in order to gain an upper-hand in trade 获得贸易优势.

For the most part 大部分情况下, the Dutch prevailed in 获胜 the first two of these wars, even getting some relaxation in the Navigation Acts 航海条例放宽 as part of peacemaking 作为议和条件.

But one exception was the Treaty of Breda 布雷达条约 that ended the war of 1665-67, when the English gained permanent control of New Amsterdam (now known as New York).

This effectively knocked the Dutch Republic out of 使…退出 what would become the lucrative North American sphere of trade and settlement 利润丰厚的北美贸易和定居领域, and also indirectly led to 间接导致 They Might Be Giants' third best song.

But the third of these wars from 1672-74 concerned politics more than mercantilist issues 重商主义问题.

It aroused high passions over 激起强烈情绪 enhancing the role of the stadtholder 加强执政的作用 and bringing William of Orange 奥兰治的威廉 to become perhaps stadtholder for life 终身执政.

If you're wondering why the Dutch soccer team wears orange, by the way, that's why.

In 1672 an angry mob 愤怒的暴徒, believing that William's rise was being prevented by brothers and high officials Johan de Witt and Cornelis de Witt proceeded to lynch 私刑处死, flay 剥皮, and cannibalize 食人肉 those brothers.

The fight over how concentrated power should be 权力集中程度, and who should have that power, clearly wasn't over.

So even as it continued to prosper 繁荣, the Dutch Republic was profoundly politically divided 政治上严重分裂 by the end of the 17th century.

Meanwhile, Great Britain, its rival on the seas 海上竞争对手, had more or less resolved 或多或少解决了 its political questions and created the ground rules 基本规则 for an effective monarchy 君主制 and its relationship with the commercial classes 商业阶层.

And that meant the Dutch Golden Age receded 衰落.

As golden ages always do.

England meanwhile, was rising again -- although only temporarily 暂时地.

Next time we'll see how eastern Europe was faring 情况如何 during the seventeenth century.

Thanks for watching; I'll see you then.

== 中文翻译

大家好，我是约翰·格林，这里是《速成欧洲史》。

在上一集中，我们看到**#不列颠群岛的绅士阶层和商人阶级, 在"光荣革命"中击败了由旧贵族支持的"专制君主制"，迎来了"君主立宪制"政府。#**
这反映了欧洲历史——就此而言，也是世界历史——上一个更广泛的发展趋势。

在这个系列中，*我们多次谈到要能够转换视角——从王室的视角，或者从农民的视角等等来看待事物。*
但历史专业的学生们, 也必须学会如何转换他们审视过去的角度。
比如，我们可以从食物供应的角度看待过去，或者从视觉艺术的角度，或者从马克思主义理论的角度等等。

*#我们选择的角度, 往往与我们当下关注的问题相关。
随着当下的变化，我们看待过去的方式, 也会随着时间而改变。#*

*##在我目前所处的当下，一个重大问题是"如何在人类之间分配权力"。
所以今天，我们将从权力的角度审视历史——我所说的权力，指的是谁来决定一个群体的目标和优先事项，##我们将看到这种"权力的分配"是如何随着时间而变化的。*

[开场介绍]
*在近代早期，君主们可以协调国家的国防事务，他们可以尝试征税，甚至试图将自己的宗教信仰强加给他们的臣民群体。*
*但随着时间的推移，经济活动越来越多地由所谓的"生产阶级"推动和控制*——拥有土地的"绅士阶级"，由于农业革命，他们每英亩土地能生产出更多的粮食；还有**"商人阶级"**，他们通过不断扩大的贸易和帝国主义活动赚钱。

*这些阶级掌握着政府财政的关键，因为他们拥有可以被征税的金钱、土地和商品，这在当时和现在, 都意味着他们有能力影响政府。
在很多情况下，这些生产阶级利用这种权力，通过倡导建立一个能够制衡君主制的"立宪政府"，来为自己在国家治理中争取发言权。*

我们在荷兰历史中尤其能看到这一点，**这些阶级推动了"立宪主义"的产生，**并创造了后来被称为荷兰黄金时代的时期。
它会永远持续下去：就像所有的黄金时代一样。

所以，和英国的改革者一样，*荷兰有一个活跃的商业阶级，他们支持从西班牙独立出来的斗争。*
这场斗争涉及, 低地国家的七个北部省份在1576年后与十个南部省份结盟，在八十年战争（Eighty Years War，也被称为荷兰起义、荷兰独立战争，或者我想, 西班牙人可能会认为这是我们北部省份的"非法独立战争"。这都取决于谁来讲述这段历史。）中击败西班牙。

但无论如何，*到16世纪末，低地国家的联合省在实际上, 已经从西班牙独立出来，尽管直到1648年的《威斯特伐利亚和约》才正式确定这一点。*
*南部省份分离出去，形成了比利时、卢森堡以及法国北部的部分地区，而七个北部省份则成为了荷兰。*

*荷兰共和国的每个省份, 都有一位"执政"（regent）负责监督省内事务，而作为一个整体，他们参加"联省议会"（States General），这是一个由每个省份的代表组成的议会，联省议会反过来会选出一位行政长官，被称为执政（stadtholder）。*
或者发音可能介于两者之间，只有荷兰人能说清楚。
我们就发音成“Stadtholder”吧。

*总之，这是一个相当松散的邦联国家，各个省份常常有着相互冲突的利益。*

比如，一方面，荷兰是最繁荣的省份，对整个邦联的财政贡献最大。
它以商业为导向，总体上更倾向于和平而非战争。
另一方面，像泽兰（Zeeland）这样的省份，其私掠船在战争的混乱中扣押船只，因此对战争的反对态度没那么强烈。
加尔文教派的神职人员支持"对天主教的西班牙发动战争"，一些小册子作者则只是喜欢战争，因为“战争能让所有的工业和贸易发展繁荣”[1] 。这有点过于简单化了。
不过，*战争是否对商业有利，这是历史上的一个重大问题。*
但可以肯定的是，战争对人们来说可不是什么好事，我认为人可能比商业更加重要，你们觉得呢？

*各个省份之间, 在"执政"的角色问题上, 也存在分歧：执政应该更像一个君主制的人物，还是说联合省应该继续以一种"共和国"的形式运作呢？*
*所以我们这里讨论的, 是一些根本性问题上的重大分歧，比如战争与和平，以及在邦联内部权力应该如何分配。* +
**这些分歧, 使得荷兰无法建立起像英国在"光荣革命"后那样集中的中央政府。**

但尽管如此，联省议会在经济政策——也就是支持贸易的战略方面——比英国更加统一，*英国的保守贵族在内战前后, 一直与商业阶级争斗不休。*

*所以，尽管在政治上存在一定程度的不统一，##荷兰共和国##在17世纪仍然繁荣发展，而且尽管经历了战争，#它实际上成为了一个相对宽容的国家。#*
事实上，它的繁荣, 使它成为了各种工匠和商人的朝圣地，这些人都想参与到荷兰的繁忙商业活动中。

[[电视画面：巴鲁赫·斯宾诺莎（BARUCH SPINOZA）]] *这个共和国成为了那些在其他地方思想受到审查的人的印刷中心。*
例如，哲学家巴鲁赫·斯宾诺莎（Baruch Spinoza）否认灵魂不朽，也不相信有超验的神灵。
*在17世纪的欧洲，这些都是相当激进的思想，事实上，斯宾诺莎在二十出头的时候, 就被他所在的犹太教会驱逐了，但他继续进行哲学研究，并且能够继续出版自己的作品。* +
值得一提的是，和大多数哲学家一样，斯宾诺莎也有一份日常工作——他为显微镜和望远镜研磨镜片。
这意味着他非常擅长转换历史的视角（双关语：研磨镜片和转换看待历史的角度）。
我觉得我应该为这个玩笑, 向我的朋友和家人道歉。
不过。
我并不觉得抱歉。

但斯宾诺莎的葡萄牙裔犹太祖先, 在16世纪就定居在了阿姆斯特丹（Amsterdam），*来自西班牙的犹太人也向北迁移，以逃避伊莎贝拉（Isabella）和斐迪南（Ferdinand）以及他们王室后代的迫害。* +
**清教徒和许多其他不遵循正统宗教的人, 也来到了荷兰，**1685年法国废除《南特敕令》后，许多胡格诺派教徒也来到了这里。 +
*当时荷兰共和国的公民是欧洲最多样化的群体之一，这也促进了荷兰的繁荣。*

*所以当时蓬勃发展的商业兴起了，特别是那些源于16世纪后期荷兰商人, 在日本、东南亚和新大陆建立的早期海上贸易网络的商业。* +
科内利斯·马泰利夫·德容（Cornelis Matelieff de Jonge）就是一个认为"海外贸易是推动荷兰整体繁荣的关键"的人。
他和其他军人以及冒险家一起，致力于为荷兰确保香料贸易。
这在很大程度上涉及到扩大与当今印度尼西亚的贸易网络。
马泰利夫·德容写了一本名为《论印度的国情与贸易》（Discourse on the State and Trade of the Indies） 的书，描述了印度尼西亚群岛以及更广阔的南部海洋地区，*荷兰政府注意到了香料贸易所带来的财富前景，于是他们授权成立贸易公司，这些公司的军事力量不仅要占领领土，还要推动贸易发展，有时会通过武力或武力威胁, 来获取商品或建立贸易路线。*

这些印度洋贸易网络高度发达，而欧洲人对它们还很陌生，相对缺乏经验。
尤其是荷兰人。
*西班牙人和葡萄牙人已经在这方面, 经营了一个多世纪。* +
*所以，尽管有武装贸易公司，荷兰人要在贸易中占据上风, 也花了好几代人的时间，不过他们会利用与当地领导人的联盟, 以及军事力量，最终成为帝国主义强国，并且##从殖民地获取的利益, 远远超过他们对殖民地福祉的投入。##*

但在那之前，荷兰的商人开始带回各种各样的植物和商品，这刺激了创新，而荷兰的地理位置, 使其船只能够进入南北和东西方向的贸易路线。

*当英国商人和领导人, 陷入长达数十年的政治争端, 和激烈的内部斗争时，荷兰人在贸易方面开始超越他们。
很快，荷兰人取代了葡萄牙人，成为了主要的大西洋奴隶贸易商，尽管英国人最终会超过他们。*

*但##到17世纪中叶，欧洲经济活动的中, 心已经从地中海地区和意大利城邦, 向北转移。##*
荷兰人蒸蒸日上。

让我们进入“思想泡泡”环节。

荷兰人利用他们的独立地位，
通过扩大航运能力来减少战争开支，
并修建了连接400英里主要城市的运河网络，
这改善了地区间的通信和贸易。
阿姆斯特丹繁荣发展，
到17世纪后期，人口增长到超过20万。
随着城市的发展，土地开垦和土木工程不断推进，
还有现在著名的阿姆斯特丹房屋设计，
其中许多房屋至今仍然屹立。
事实上，我在写《无比美妙的痛苦》（The Fault in Our Stars） 的时候，就住在一栋17世纪的荷兰房子里。

但说到创新，荷兰画家兼发明家扬·范德海登（Jan Van der Heyden）设计了一种长燃灯芯，
这为城市带来了夜间照明，
并减少了犯罪。
他还发明了便携式抽水设备来灭火，
从17世纪开始，这大大降低了城市火灾的破坏力。

与此同时，包括范德海登在内的荷兰艺术家们, 擅长描绘一些相对较新的肖像主题：普通人，他们的日常生活和家庭内部场景，
以及越来越多地摆满他们家中的商品。这些商品许多来自遥远的地方，包括中国的瓷器、中东的地毯和进口的纺织品。

此外，约翰内斯·维米尔（Johannes Vermeer）的画作，
和范德海登的画作一样，
以地图和地球仪为特色，
证明了中上层阶级的世界主义观念。

但即使是荷兰城市里的普通工人, 也可能拥有一幅画和一些书籍，作为精神和视觉上的滋养，
这与仅仅一两个世纪前形成了鲜明的对比。

感谢“思想泡泡”！

*#由于荷兰人现在以英国人无法做到的方式 主导着贸易，英国的奥利弗·克伦威尔（Oliver Cromwell）的政府试图通过1651年的《航海条例》（Navigation Act）夺回对海洋的控制权。
该条例规定，任何使用英国港口（无论是在英国本土还是在其殖民地）的货物, 都必须使用英国船只运输。
这是立法"重商主义"的一个例子#*。

我们之前提到过，*重商主义理论认为, 全球经济的规模是有限的。
我们现在明白，全球经济这个大蛋糕的规模, 可以变大或变小*，但在当时，重商主义理论认为, 整体经济是停滞的，这意味着要变得更富有，你就必须从其他地方获取财富。 +
例如，*#关税是"重商主义"的一个常见特征——在经济蛋糕有限的情况下，一个国家应该只出口商品并赚取黄金；它绝不应该购买外国商品，因为那意味着把财富输出给了竞争对手国家。#* +
*显然，这种情况在殖民地地区表现得最为明显，但在欧洲内部也同样存在，因为各国都试图从彼此那里获取财富和财产。*

*在1652年至1674年间，英国人三次挑起与荷兰人的战争，以便在贸易中占据上风。*
在这些战争的前两次中，荷兰人大多取得了胜利，甚至在和平谈判中让《航海条例》有所放宽。
但《布雷达条约》（Treaty of Breda）是个例外，该条约结束了1665-1667年的战争，*英国人通过该条约获得了对新阿姆斯特丹（New Amsterdam，现在称为纽约）的永久控制权。*
**这实际上使荷兰共和国退出了后来利润丰厚的北美贸易和定居领域，**也间接催生了They Might Be Giants乐队第三好听的歌曲。

但1672-1674年的第三次战争, 更多地涉及政治问题，而非"重商主义"问题。
它引发了人们对于加强执政角色, 以及让奥兰治的威廉（William of Orange）成为"终身执政"的强烈情绪。
顺便说一下，如果你想知道为什么荷兰足球队穿橙色球衣，原因就在这里。

1672年，一群愤怒的暴民认为, 约翰·德维特（Johan de Witt）和科内利斯·德维特（Cornelis de Witt）兄弟以及高级官员们, 在阻止威廉的崛起，于是他们对这兄弟俩进行了私刑处决、剥皮，甚至食人行为。 +
*关于权力应该集中到什么程度，以及谁应该拥有权力的斗争，显然还没有结束。
所以，即使荷兰共和国继续繁荣发展，到17世纪末，它在政治上也出现了严重的分裂。*

*与此同时，它在海上的竞争对手——英国，或多或少已经解决了自己的政治问题，并为有效的君主制, 以及君主制与商业阶级的关系, 制定了基本规则。
这意味着荷兰的"黄金时代"逐渐衰落。*
就像所有的黄金时代一样。
与此同时，英国又开始崛起——尽管只是暂时的。

下次我们将看看17世纪东欧的情况。
感谢观看，到时候见。

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

So in the last episode, we saw the gentry and merchant class of the British Isles defeat the old aristocrat-backed, absolutist monarchy in the Glorious Revolution, ushering in a constitutional government.

And this points to a wider development in European history -- and for that matter world history.

So, we've talked a lot in this series about being able to shift perspectives -- to see things from royal perspectives, or from peasant perspectives, and so on.

But students of history must also learn how to shift the lenses through which they look at the past.

Like, we might look at the past through the lens of food availability, or through the lens of visual art, or through the lens of Marxist theory, and so on.

And the lenses we choose are often about our present concerns.

The way that we look at the past changes over time, as the present changes.

And in the present where I'm currently standing, one of the big questions is how to distribute power among humans.

So today, we're going to look at history through the lens of power -- by which I mean, who gets to decide the ambitions and priorities of a community, and we'll see how the distribution of that power can change over time.

[Intro]
So, in the early modern period monarchs could coordinate national defense, and they could try to collect taxes and even try to impose their religious beliefs on their communities.

But increasingly over time, economic activity was driven and controlled by the so-called productive classes -- land-owning gentry who were producing more food per acre thanks to the agricultural revolution, and merchants who were making money due to expanding trade and imperialism.

These classes held the key to government finances, because they were the ones with the money and land and goods that could be taxed, which then -- as now -- meant that they had power to sway governments.

And in many cases, these productive classes used this power to give themselves a say in the running of their country through advocating for a constitutional government that could keep the monarchy in check.

We see this especially in Dutch history, where these classes brought about constitutionalism and created what has come to be known as the Dutch Golden Age.

It'll last forever: just like all golden ages.

So, like British reformers, the Dutch had an active business class, who were backing the struggle for independence from Spain.

This struggle involved the seven northern provinces of the Low Countries allying with the ten southern provinces after 1576 to defeat the Spanish in the Eighty Years War (also known as the Dutch revolts or the Dutch War of Independence or I suppose the Spanish probably thought of it as Our Northern Province's Illegal War of Secession.

It all depends on who's telling the story.

But anyway, by the end of the sixteenth century the United Provinces of the low countries had become functionally independent from Spain, though it wasn't formalized until 1648 in the Treaty of Westphalia.

The southern provinces spun off to constitute Belgium, Luxembourg, and parts of northern France, while the seven northern provinces became the Netherlands.

Each province of the Dutch Republic had a regent who oversaw provincial affairs, while as a group they participated in the States General, a kind of council of representatives from each province, which in turn chose a single executive, known as the stadtholder, or stadtholder.

Or probably somewhere halfway in between those that only Dutch people can say.

We'll say Stadtholder.

Anyway, all in all, this was a fairly loose confederation of states, and they often had competing interests.

Like, Holland, on the one hand, was the most prosperous and contributed the most to the overall finances of the group.

It was commercially-oriented and generally favored peace over war.

On the other side were provinces like Zeeland whose privateers seized ships during the chaos of warfare and were therefore somewhat less opposed to it.

Calvinist clergymen favored war against Catholic Spain and some pamphleteers simply liked war because "it caused all industry and trade to grow and prosper."[1] Which is a bit of an oversimplification.

Although, whether war is good for business is one of the big questions of history.

It's definitely not great for people, though, which I would argue are possibly even more important than businesses?

There was also disagreement among the provinces about the role of the stadtholder: Should the Stadtholder become more of a monarchical figure, or should the United Provinces continue to function as a kind of republic?

So we're talking here about big differences about fundamental matters, like war and peace and how power should be distributed within the confederation.

And these differences prevented the kind of focused central government that England built after its Glorious Revolution.

But nonetheless, the States General had greater unity in economic policy -- that is in its strategy for backing trade -- than the English did, whose conservative aristocracy were always battling the commercial classes both before and after the English civil war.

So despite a measure of political disunity, the Dutch Republic prospered in the seventeenth century and in spite of warfare, it actually became a comparatively tolerant state.

In fact its prosperity made it a kind of mecca for all sorts of artisans and business people who wanted to participate in Dutch hustle and bustle.

[[TV: BARUCH SPINOZA]] The republic became a center of printing for people whose thoughts had been censored elsewhere.

For instance, philosopher Baruch Spinoza denied the immortality of the soul and didn't believe in a transcendent deity.

Those were pretty radical ideas in 17th century Europe, and in fact, Spinoza was banished from his Jewish congregation in his early twenties, but he continued his philosophical labors, and he was able to continue publishing.

It's also worth noting that, like most philosophers, Spinoza did have a day job -- he ground lenses for microscopes and telescopes.

Meaning that he was very good at shifting historical lenses.

I feel like I should apologize to my friends and family for that joke.

Except.

That I'm not sorry.

But Spinoza's Portuguese Jewish ancestors had settled in Amsterdam in the sixteenth century, and Jewish people from Spain also migrated north to escape persecution by Isabella and Ferdinand and their royal descendants.

Pilgrims and many other religious non-conformists also went to the Netherlands, as did many Huguenots after the French revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685.

The citizens of the Dutch Republic were among the most diverse in Europe at the time, and that contributed to the Netherlands prosperity.

So thriving businesses arose at the time, especially ones deriving from the early maritime networks its merchants had developed in Japan, Southeast Asia, and the New World late in the sixteenth century.

Cornelis Matelieff de Jonge was one person who saw overseas trade as key to advancing overall Dutch prosperity.

Along with other military men and adventurers, embarked on securing the spice trade for the Netherlands.

This largely involved expanding trade networks with present day Indonesia.

Matelieff de Jonge wrote a book called Discourse on the State and Trade of the Indies that described the Indonesian islands and the broader southern oceanic region, and the Dutch government took notice of the riches promised by the spice trade, so they authorized the creation of trading companies whose military forces didn't just take territory, but also sought to advance trade, at times acquiring goods or establishing trade routes via force or the threat of it.

These Indian Ocean trade networks were highly developed, and Europeans were new to them, and relatively inexperienced.

Especially the Dutch.

The Spanish and Portuguese had been at it for more than a century.

And so despite armed trading companies, gaining the upper hand in trade took the Dutch generations, although they would use alliances with local leaders and military might to become imperialist powers in time, and eventually extract far more than they invested in the well-being of colonies.

But before all that, Holland's merchants began bringing back an array of plants and commodities, which stimulated innovation, while its geographic positioning enabled its ships to access north-south and east-west trade routes.

And as English merchants and leaders became wrapped up in decades of political disputes and lethal combat among themselves, the Dutch began to outperform them in trade.

Soon the Dutch had replaced the Portuguese as the primary Atlantic slave traders, although the English would eventually overtake them.

But by the middle of the 17th Century, the center of economic activity in Europe had migrated from the Mediterranean and Italian city-states, north.

The Dutch were thriving.

Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

The Dutch took advantage of their independence
and reduced war expenses by
expanding their shipping capacity and
building a network of canals connecting 400 miles of major cities
which improved communication and trade regionally.
Amsterdam flourished,
growing to over 200,000 people by late in the century.
And as it grew, land reclamation and civil engineering advanced,
along with the now-famous design of Amsterdam's houses,
many of which are still standing.
In fact, I lived in a 17th century Dutch home while writing The Fault in Our Stars.
But speaking of innovation, Dutch painter and inventor Jan Van der Heyden devised a long-burning wick,
which brought cities nighttime illumination
and a reduction in crime.
He also created portable pumping devices to extinguish fires,
which drastically reduced the destructive power of urban fires beginning in the seventeenth century.
Meanwhile Dutch artists, including Van der Heyden, excelled in painting some relatively new portrait subjects:
common people,
and their everyday lives and domestic interiors,
and the commodities that increasingly filled their homes.
Many of these commodities came from distant lands
and included Chinese porcelain, Middle Eastern carpets, and imported textiles.
In addition, the paintings of Johannes Vermeer,
alongside those of Van der Heyden,
featured maps and globes,
testifying to the cosmopolitanism of the middle and upper classes.
But even ordinary workers in Dutch cities might have a painting and books for intellectual and visual nourishment,
which was a stark contrast from just a century or two earlier.
Thanks Thought Bubble.

So with the Dutch now commanding trade in a way that the English could not, Oliver Cromwell's government sought to take back control of the seas with the Navigation Act of 1651.

It mandated the use of English ships for any goods using English ports, whether in Britain itself or in its colonies.

This was one example of legislated mercantilism.

Now, we've mentioned this before, but mercantilist theory sees the global economy as finite.

We now understand that the size of the global economy's overall pie can get bigger and smaller, but at the time Mercantilist theory saw the overall economy as stagnant, which meant to become wealthier, you had to take wealth from other places.

Tariffs for instance, were a common feature of mercantilism -- with a finite economic pie, a nation should only export goods and take in gold for them; it should never buy foreign goods because that would mean losing wealth to a competing nation.

Now, this obviously happened most dramatically in colonized regions, but it also happened within Europe, as nations sought to take wealth and possessions from one another.

Three separate times between 1652 and 1674, the English provoked warfare with the Dutch in order to gain an upper-hand in trade.

For the most part, the Dutch prevailed in the first two of these wars, even getting some relaxation in the Navigation Acts as part of peacemaking.

But one exception was the Treaty of Breda that ended the war of 1665-67, when the English gained permanent control of New Amsterdam (now known as New York).

This effectively knocked the Dutch Republic out of what would become the lucrative North American sphere of trade and settlement, and also indirectly led to They Might Be Giants' third best song.

But the third of these wars from 1672-74 concerned politics more than mercantilist issues.

It aroused high passions over enhancing the role of the stadtholder and bringing William of Orange to become perhaps stadtholder for life.

If you're wondering why the Dutch soccer team wears orange, by the way, that's why.

In 1672 an angry mob, believing that William's rise was being prevented by brothers and high officials Johan de Witt and Cornelis de Witt proceeded to lynch, flay, and cannibalize those brothers.

The fight over how concentrated power should be, and who should have that power, clearly wasn't over.

So even as it continued to prosper, the Dutch Republic was profoundly politically divided by the end of the 17th century.

Meanwhile, Great Britain, its rival on the seas, had more or less resolved its political questions and created the ground rules for an effective monarchy and its relationship with the commercial classes.

And that meant the Dutch Golden Age receded.

As golden ages always do.

England meanwhile, was rising again -- although only temporarily.

Next time we'll see how eastern Europe was faring during the seventeenth century.

Thanks for watching; I'll see you then.
