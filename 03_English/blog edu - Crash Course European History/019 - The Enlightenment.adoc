== 释义

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

So far, we've seen a ton of 大量的 political change and continuing warfare 战争 in the midst of 在…之中 the seventeenth century's Little Ice Age 小冰河期, and history often focuses on these types of political and military stories.

But there were also other changes occurring: shifts 转变 in how people perceived 感知；认识 the everyday world.

The linking of phenomena 现象 like earthquakes and eclipses 日食；月食 with human events goes back a very long way, like to the beginning of our species, as does the belief that supernatural forces 超自然力量 are deeply shaping the lives of individual humans.

For instance, in a previous video about witchcraft 巫术, we discussed how earthquake tremors 震动 in Istanbul in 1648 were seen as portents 预兆 of a sultan's 苏丹 death a few months later.

But a century after that, a huge earthquake struck Lisbon, Portugal on All Saints' Day 诸圣节 of 1755.

Tens of thousands of people died, many from a tsunami 海啸 that followed the quake 地震.

Now, some theologians 神学家 argued this was punishment 惩罚 from God for the world's sins 罪孽, but others pointed out that the earthquake had destroyed a lot of churches while sparing 使幸免 a lot of brothels 妓院.

Voltaire 伏尔泰 wrote a famous poem in response to 回应 the earthquake that included the memorable lines: "As the dying voices call out, will you dare respond to this appalling 骇人听闻的 spectacle 景象 of smoking ashes with, 'This is the necessary effect of the eternal laws freely chosen by God?'"

The way Europeans were looking at the world had changed between the Istanbul earthquake and the Lisbon one: The Enlightenment 启蒙运动 was thriving 蓬勃发展.

[Intro]

So, today we want to emphasize 强调 that the Enlightenment wasn't all high-falutin' 浮夸的 calculations 计算 of the sun's orbit 轨道 or theories about the mathematical laws of the universe or, for that matter 就此而言, theories about earthquake causality 因果关系.

It also considered more down-to-earth 实际的 situations like how people of different social classes 社会阶层 relate to 与…有关联 one another, how trade and manufacturing 制造业 should function 运作, and what the relationship of ordinary people should be to their government.

The Enlightenment, or Age of Light 光明时代, refers to 指的是 the belief that the musty 陈旧的 old ideas needed to be exposed to 暴露于 rational investigation 理性研究 to see if they were still valuable.

The bright light of reason 理性 needed to shine on tradition 传统.

And this momentous 重大的 challenge to tradition came about 发生 during a time in which Europe was being completely transformed 转变 in many ways that are sometimes forgotten amid 在…中 all the excitement about Voltaire and reason.

So let's go straight to the Thought Bubble today.

Beyond the wars and state-building 国家建设 we've already seen,
increasing abundance 富足 and novelty 新奇事物 was creeping into 逐渐进入 the everyday lives of Europeans.
Coffee, tea, chocolate, tobacco 烟草, and other commodities 商品 led to experimentation 尝试.
For instance, one English housewife 家庭主妇 saw tea for the first time and thought it was meant to be baked as a kind of pie filling 馅饼馅.
A diplomat 外交官 said that tea and coffee had brought a greater "sobriety" 清醒 and "civility" 文明 to everyday life in Europe.
Europe had previously been a land of famine 饥荒 and mere subsistence 勉强维持生计 for essentially all of its history.
But now the cultivation 种植 of new foods from the Americas like potatoes and corn,
along with literally thousands of other new plants, meant that available calories 卡路里 were increasing,
and it also introduced the idea that maybe the world didn't have to be perpetually 永远地 on the brink of 在…的边缘 starvation 饥饿 and catastrophe 灾难.
Also, by this time, tens of thousands of Europeans had traveled the world and had experienced other social orders 社会秩序 firsthand 直接地.
For instance, travelers discovered that people across Asia didn't seem as quarrelsome 好争吵的 as Europeans.
Drivers of carts did not block narrow streets for hours arguing over who had the right of way 通行权.
They politely agreed to let one or the other pass.
They also saw that not all social orders were as hierarchical 等级森严的 as most European ones,
and that some societies even gave less weight to 不那么重视 a person's parentage 出身
and more to that person's individual skills and talents 才能.
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

[[TV-Montesquieu]] One of the first ways writers criticized outmoded 过时的 ways of life was to make fun of 取笑 them...writers like Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu 孟德斯鸠, aka 又名 Just Montesquieu.

(He really was the person to criticize outmoded ways of life because, boy, did he have an outmoded name.)

Montesquieu was a jurist 法学家 who owned an estate 庄园 near Bordeaux 波尔多, which still makes wine under his name, and in 1721, he published the Persian Letters 《波斯人信札》, in which Uzbek 乌兹别克的 visitors find Europe amusing if not shocking.

The visitors, for instance, are amazed at the magic of priests 牧师 who somehow perform the trick of turning wine into blood.

And although they clearly see the problems in French society, they firmly adhere to 坚持 the mustiness 陈旧 of their own ways, such as keeping women secluded 隔离 in a harem 后宫 and guarded by eunuchs 太监.

The message was that both easterners 东方人 and Europeans were imperfect 不完美的.

The author Voltaire -- who, slightly off topic 稍微跑题一下, was very handsome. I mean, very striking eyes 迷人的眼睛.

At any rate 无论如何, he had similarly critical and amusing takes 看法; his discourtesy 无礼 to aristocrats 贵族 eventually got him sent to the Bastille prison 巴士底狱, in fact.

In many rollicking 欢闹的 tales, he made fun of overweening 傲慢的 rulers and their endless corruptions 腐败.

He valued honesty 诚实 and those who lived simple lives "cultivating their gardens" 打理自己的花园, as he famously put it in his satirical novel 讽刺小说 Candide 《老实人》(1759), which you can learn more about in Crash Course Literature.

Full of horrors 恐怖 and injustice 不公, Candide appeared four years after the Lisbon earthquake, which Voltaire thought was firm evidence 确凿证据 that we did not live in the best of all possible worlds.

To replace the old stuffy 古板的 ways of monarchs 君主 and aristocrats, people needed to learn how to embrace 接受 the newly desirable traits 特质 of the Enlightenment, like being honest, and inquisitive 好奇的, and open.

Swiss thinker 思想家 Jean-Jacques Rousseau 让 - 雅克·卢梭 had many ideas about education reform 教育改革, for instance.

He was not a wealthy or titled 有头衔的 person but rather was born into a watchmaking family 制表家庭 and lived among artisans 工匠.

His best-selling novel Emile 《爱弥儿》(1762) describes a boy who grows up not in a city or palace but in a countryside where one can be oneself -- a natural individual 自然的个体.

Instead of experiencing common rote learning 死记硬背的学习, with large doses of 大量的 religious and classical reading, Emile learns carpentry 木工, and gardening 园艺, and other practical skills 实用技能.

In the countryside, he behaves in the best possible way -- naturally and without pretentious airs 自命不凡的样子.

Rousseau promoted 宣扬 what would come to be called middle-class values 中产阶级价值观, like hard work, practicality 实用性, and domesticity 家庭生活 for women.

When Emile becomes a young man, the spouse 配偶 chosen for him is plump 丰满的 and smiling and devoted to 致力于 taking care of him -- not studying or reading or practicing a craft 手艺 or working hard to support the family like farm women did.

Also, she will breastfeed 母乳喂养 their children, whereas both aristocratic women and busy working women at the time commonly used wet nurses 奶妈.

As with Emile's upbringing 成长, all of this is presented as "natural."

Meanwhile, wealthy women in Europe instituted 创立 the Enlightenment salon 启蒙沙龙: regular get-togethers 聚会 in their homes to hear the latest idea, learn about the latest book, or meet the latest philosopher-influencer 有影响力的哲学家 -- called a philosophe 哲学家 in French.

Slightly off topic, but I just love the idea of Rousseau and Voltaire as influencers 有影响力的人.

Like, I would have loved to see their Instagram feeds 动态.

Voltaire's smoldering selfies 充满魅力的自拍, Rousseau's weird rants 怪异的 rant written in the Notes app and then screenshotted 截屏.

It would have been gold.

At any rate, 18th-century salon goers 沙龙参与者 were often great readers or experimenters with the latest commodities and fashion 时尚.

Just like contemporary influencers, actually.

And in terms of 在…方面 fashion, instead of looking to 指望 the courts 宫廷 for fashion inspiration 灵感, men like Voltaire now sported 穿戴 cottons 棉布 from India made into handkerchiefs 手帕 that were worn around the neck, which would soon metamorphose into 演变成 the necktie 领带.

They also sported banyans （印度男子穿的）长袍 -- that is, loose bathrobe-type garments 宽松的浴袍式服装 -- that did not need corsets 紧身胸衣, which men traditionally wore.

As Rousseau believed, men should take off their makeup 妆容, wigs 假发, and high heels 高跟鞋 and be natural -- just like people did in other parts of the world.

Just natural man as he is naturally made in the countryside, wearing a banyan and a feathered hat 羽毛帽子.

Transformation 变革 was in the air for everyone, not just the elites 精英.

Although imported foreign cottons were still illegal in France, for instance, many people now wore them, including servants 仆人, who received cast-off 丢弃的 cotton dresses or shirts that were bright and easy to keep clean.

And to help people learn, there were many more texts 书籍.

Like in France, there was the Encyclopédie 《百科全书》(you'll notice my amazing French pronunciation).

It provided discussions of topics such as natural rights 自然权利 and the status of women 女性地位.

Its main editor, Denis Diderot 德尼·狄德罗, wrote: "All things must be examined, debated, investigated without exception 例外 and without regard for 不顾 anyone's feelings."

Diderot favored social and political reform 改革.

But the Encyclopédie -- you know what, I'm gonna just translate it -- Encyclopedia 百科全书, also contained technical drawings 技术图纸 of machinery 机械, including machinery for mining 采矿.

And that reflected practical values 实用价值 and also provided a spur to 激励 inventiveness 创造力 and growing prosperity 繁荣 in Europe.

Also, mining 采矿, which was already pretty important, was about to become EXTREMELY important, thanks to coal 煤炭.

In general, Enlightenment aims 目标 were more worldly 世俗的 than spiritual 精神的.

In Scotland, philosopher 哲学家 David Hume 大卫·休谟 promoted reason above religion, concluding that belief in God was mere superstition 迷信.

Some people, called Deists 自然神论者, argued that God existed but that he didn't influence everyday life after having set the machine of the universe in motion 使宇宙运转.

Many important "founding fathers" 开国元勋 of the United States were deists, and if you believe, as many philosophers did, that God keeps a distance from 与…保持距离 human affairs 事务, then the persecution 迫害 of people for their religious beliefs starts to seem like cruel fanaticism 残忍的狂热.

And some philosophes 哲学家 became activists 活动家.

Like, Voltaire was outraged by 对…感到愤怒 the torture 酷刑 of Jean Calas 让·卡拉斯, who had been accused of 被指控 murdering his son to prevent him from converting to 改信 Catholicism 天主教.

(Calas's son had in fact committed suicide 自杀 due to gambling debts 赌债.)

Calas was waterboarded 水刑 and had every bone in his body broken before eventually dying under torture.

Is there a bone back there?

All right, listen.

This is a femur 股骨.

I don't think this is an actual femur, I think it's, like, a recreation 复制品 -- Stan, is this a real femur?

It is NOT a real femur.

So I asked our brilliant writer Bonnie if Calas really had every bone in his body broken, and she responded, "It's hard to know whether they got every one," and then she described Calas's torture to me with a level of detail that led me to conclude that ONE, they probably did break every bone in his body, and TWO, oh my god, torture in 18th-century Europe was THE WORST.

So, last thing I'm going to say about this: if you invent a time machine 时光机, and I believe absolutely that you can, do not go back in time before like, maybe 2003?

Don't get me wrong -- things are bad, but remember: they used to be so much worse.

Speaking of 说到 terrible, let's talk about slavery 奴隶制.

So, Enlightenment views 观点 also fed into 促进 rising movements 运动 in Britain, France, the Netherlands, and their colonies 殖民地 to abolish 废除 slavery.

By this time, the slave trade 奴隶贸易 was massive 大规模的, and there was growing acknowledgement 承认 of its cruelties 残酷.

In 1770, the French Catholic abbé 修道院院长 (or clergyman 牧师) Guillaume Raynal 纪尧姆·雷纳尔 laid out 阐述 the violent devastation 暴力破坏 of native peoples 原住民 by invading Europeans.

And in 1788, the freed slave 自由奴隶 Olaudah Equiano 奥劳达·伊奎亚诺 described the Middle Passage 中央航路 after he had been kidnapped 绑架 in present-day Nigeria 尼日利亚 and enslaved 奴役.

Now, Equiano is often believed to have been born in South Carolina, and his riveting memoir 扣人心弦的回忆录 may have been cobbled together from 拼凑 the harrowing tales 悲惨故事 of others.

Still, it was a bestseller 畅销书.

It captured the inhumanity 不人道 of whites towards blacks, advocated 倡导 Enlightenment freedom and human rights for all.

It also stirred 激起 freedmen 自由民 and slaves to struggle for abolition 废除.

And there was also growing movements for other kinds of freedom.

The Scotsman 苏格兰人 Adam Smith 亚当·斯密 took on 挑战 the mercantilist theory 重商主义理论 that global wealth was static 静态的 and states could only increase wealth by taking it from others when he rejected ideas about stockpiling gold 囤积黄金, and refusing entry of goods into one's country 拒绝外国商品进入本国, and also remaining a subsistence agricultural economy 自给自足的农业经济 with serfs 农奴.

He advocated for 主张 manufacturing 制造业, the division of labor 劳动分工, and free trade 自由贸易.

In a free or laissez-faire market 自由放任的市场, an individual would work and interact with 与…互动 others in the economy on the basis of 根据 their self-interest 自身利益.

And the sum of all self-interests would make for 导致 a balanced, harmonious 和谐的, and prosperous society 繁荣的社会.

Smith is best known as the father of the free market 自由市场, free trade, and individualism 个人主义 thanks to his 1776 book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations 《国富论》.

But he also opposed absolutism 专制主义 and urged concern for 呼吁关注 the overall well-being of society 社会的整体福祉.

In addition to 除了 the benefits of laissez-faire that he saw, Smith saw the potential harms 潜在危害, so he also argued for healing social policies 社会政策.

Another important Enlightenment book was Jean-Jacques Rousseau's The Social Contract 《社会契约论》, which famously begins, "Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains 锁链."

Rousseau picked up on 接受 John Locke's theme of the contract 契约 that individuals made with one another to form a state or nation.

And he believed that once freely formed, the state embodied 体现 the best that was in the collective community 集体社会; thus, individuals needed to give the state unconditional obedience 无条件服从 because it represented the "general will 公意."

Today, thinkers see that this call for obedience to the general will planted the seeds of 埋下…的种子 dictatorial governments 独裁政府 in the twentieth century and beyond.

But Rousseau did also emphasize individual sentiments 个人情感 as valuable.

At the opposite end of Rousseau's "general will" was German philosopher Immanuel Kant 伊曼努尔·康德's attention to individual reason 个人理性.

He famously exclaimed 宣称, "Dare to Know 敢于求知," as he advanced 推进 the Enlightenment's commitment to 致力于 the human mind 人类思维 and the ability of every person to think for themselves 独立思考 instead of simply obeying old commands and ideas.

The human mind, he argued, housed "categories of understanding 理解范畴" with which information interacted to produce purely rational judgments 纯粹理性的判断.

And in this way, Kant shared the faith in 对…抱有信心 the individual of both Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith, and we can trace our own culture's individualism 个人主义 back to 追溯到 the Enlightenment.

And many other individuals took refuge in 从…中寻求慰藉 Enlightenment thought 启蒙思想 as well as taking it as a call to action 行动的号召.

Upper-class Jewish women across Europe found the world of ideas so inspiring 鼓舞人心的 that they began salons, too.

In Berlin, they established nine of the fourteen salons in the city.

And philosopher and author  Moses Mendelssohn  used the more tolerant atmosphere 宽容的氛围 to express his optimism 乐观 about the future of Jews in Europe.
Because of the Enlightenment emphasis on 强调 reason, he believed that the age-old persecution 由来已久的迫害 of Jews would soon end.
Of course, we now know that that wasn't the case 情况并非如此.
And much exploitation 剥削 and oppression 压迫 has taken place in the guise of 以… 为幌子 reasoned thought 理性思维.
Pseudoscientific "reason" 伪科学的 “理性” has been used to justify 为… 辩护 many forms of structural inequality 结构性不平等，from racism 种族主义 to sexism 性别歧视 to class systems 阶级制度.
Rationality 理性 would not prove to be a way out of 摆脱 the human urge 欲望 to create and marginalize 边缘化 outsiders.
But Enlightenment thought 启蒙思想 was nonetheless 尽管如此 transformative 变革性的，and seeking worldly explanations 世俗的解释 for inequality and injustice 不公 did have significant real-world consequences 重大的现实影响.
I mean, no longer would we see earthquakes merely as acts of God 上帝的行为.
Enlightenment challenges to the idea that we already were living in the best of all possible worlds would help us to imagine, and eventually live in, better worlds -- albeit 尽管 ones that are still profoundly imperfect 极其不完美的.
Thanks for watching.
I'll see you next time.

大家好，我是约翰·格林，这里是《速成欧洲史》。

到目前为止，我们已经看到在17世纪的小冰期期间发生了大量的政治变革, 和持续不断的战争，而历史往往聚焦于这类政治和军事故事。

但同时也发生着其他变化：人们对日常世界的认知方式, 在转变。

将地震和日食等现象, 与人类事件联系起来的做法, 可以追溯到很久以前，几乎可以追溯到人类诞生之初，同样，认为超自然力量深刻影响着个人生活的观念也是如此。

例如，在之前关于巫术的一个视频中，我们讨论过1648年伊斯坦布尔（Istanbul）的地震震动, 是如何被视为几个月后一位苏丹去世的预兆的。

但在那之后的一个世纪，1755年万圣节，**一场巨大的地震**袭击了葡萄牙（Portugal）的里斯本（Lisbon）。
数万人丧生，其中许多人死于地震后的海啸。
*当时，一些神学家认为, 这是上帝对世人罪孽的惩罚，但也有人指出，地震摧毁了许多教堂，却放过了很多妓院。*
伏尔泰（Voltaire）针对这次地震写了一首著名的诗，其中有这样令人难忘的诗句：“当垂死之人的呼喊响起，面对这冒着烟的废墟的可怕景象，你怎敢回应说，‘这是上帝自由选择的永恒法则的必然结果’？”

从伊斯坦布尔地震, 到里斯本地震期间，欧洲人看待世界的方式发生了变化：启蒙运动（Enlightenment）蓬勃发展。

[开场介绍]

所以，今天我们想强调的是，**启蒙运动并不全是关于对太阳轨道的高深计算，或是关于宇宙数学法则的理论，**就此而言，也不全是关于地震因果关系的理论。
*它也考虑了更实际的情况，比如不同社会阶层的人们如何相互交往，贸易和制造业应该如何运作，以及普通人与他们的政府之间应该是怎样的关系。*
*#启蒙运动，或称为理性时代，指的是一种信念，即那些陈旧过时的观念需要接受理性的审视，以判断它们是否仍然有价值。#*
理性的光芒需要照亮传统。
而对传统的这一重大挑战发生在这样一个时期，当时欧洲在许多方面正经历着彻底的变革，而这些变革在人们对伏尔泰和理性的兴奋中有时会被遗忘。

所以今天我们直接进入“思想泡泡”环节。

除了我们已经看到的战争和国家建设之外，
日益丰富的物质和新鲜事物, 正悄然融入欧洲人的日常生活。
咖啡、茶、巧克力、烟草和其他商品, 引发了各种尝试。
例如，一位英国家庭主妇第一次看到茶时，以为它是用来烘焙成某种馅饼馅料的。
一位外交官说，茶和咖啡为欧洲的日常生活带来了更多的“清醒”和“文明”。
*在欧洲此前的历史中，基本上一直是一个饥荒频仍、仅能维持生计的大陆。
但现在，来自美洲（Americas）的新食物，如土豆和玉米的种植，*
以及实际上成千上万种其他新植物，意**味着可获取的卡路里在增加，
这也带来了一种观念，即也许世界不必永远处于饥饿和灾难的边缘。**

此外，到这个时候，成千上万的欧洲人已经环游世界，亲身体验了其他社会秩序。
例如，旅行者们发现，亚洲各地的人们似乎不像欧洲人那样好争吵。
赶车的人不会为了谁有先行权, 而在狭窄的街道上争吵数小时，阻塞交通。
他们会礼貌地达成一致，让一方先通过。
他们还看到，并非所有的社会秩序, 都像大多数欧洲社会那样等级森严，
而且一些社会甚至不太看重一个人的出身，
而更看重那个人的个人技能和才华。

感谢“思想泡泡”！

[[电视画面 - 孟德斯鸠（Montesquieu）]] 作家们批评过时生活方式的最初方式之一就是拿它们开玩笑……比如像夏尔 - 路易·德·塞孔达，拉布雷德与孟德斯鸠男爵（Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu），也就是大家熟知的孟德斯鸠（Montesquieu）这样的作家。
（他确实是批评过时生活方式的合适人选，因为，哎呀，他的名字可真够老派的。）
孟德斯鸠是一名法学家，他在波尔多（Bordeaux）附近拥有一处庄园，那里至今仍以他的名字酿造葡萄酒。1721年，他出版了《波斯人信札》（Persian Letters），在书中，乌兹别克（Uzbek）的访客们觉得欧洲既有趣又令人震惊。
例如，这些访客对牧师们的“魔法”感到惊奇，牧师们不知怎么就表演了把酒变成血的戏法。
而且，尽管他们清楚地看到了法国社会的问题，但他们仍然坚定地坚持自己陈旧的生活方式，比如把女人幽禁在后宫，由太监看守。
书中传达的信息是，东方人和欧洲人都不完美。

作家伏尔泰——顺便说一句，他非常英俊。我是说，他的眼睛非常迷人。
无论如何，他也有类似的批判性且有趣的观点；事实上，他对贵族的无礼最终导致他被关进了巴士底狱（Bastille prison）。
在许多引人入胜的故事中，他嘲笑那些自负的统治者以及他们无尽的腐败行为。
他重视诚实以及那些“打理自己的花园”、过着简朴生活的人，正如他在讽刺小说《老实人》（Candide，1759年）中著名的表述，关于这本书你可以在《速成文学课》中了解更多。
《老实人》充满了恐怖和不公，在里斯本地震发生四年后出版，伏尔泰认为这次地震是一个确凿的证据，证明我们并非生活在一个可能的最好的世界里。
为了取代君主和贵族们陈旧乏味的生活方式，人们需要学会接受启蒙运动中新的、令人向往的特质，比如诚实、好奇和开放。

例如，瑞士思想家让 - 雅克·卢梭（Jean-Jacques Rousseau）对教育改革有很多想法。
他并非出身富有或拥有贵族头衔，而是出生于一个制表匠家庭，生活在工匠之中。
他的畅销书《爱弥儿》（Emile，1762年）描述了一个男孩的成长经历，他不是在城市或宫殿里长大，而是在乡村，在那里他可以做真实的自己——一个自然的个体。
爱弥儿没有接受常见的死记硬背式学习，没有大量的宗教和经典阅读，而是学习了木工、园艺和其他实用技能。
在乡村，他以最好的方式行事——自然而不做作。
卢梭倡导后来被称为中产阶级价值观的东西，比如努力工作、实用性以及女性的家庭观念。
当爱弥儿长大成人后，为他选择的配偶丰满、爱笑且全心全意照顾他——不像农家妇女那样学习、阅读、从事手艺或努力工作来支撑家庭。
而且，她会亲自给孩子哺乳，而当时的贵族女性和忙碌的职业女性通常都会请奶妈。
就像爱弥儿的成长经历一样，所有这些都被描绘成“自然的”。

与此同时，欧洲的富有的女性创办了启蒙沙龙（Enlightenment salon）：定期在她们家中聚会，聆听最新的思想，了解最新的书籍，或者结识最新的有影响力的哲学家——在法语中称为“philosophe”。
稍微跑题一下，但我真的很喜欢把卢梭和伏尔泰想象成有影响力的人。
就像，我很想看看他们的Instagram动态。
伏尔泰那充满魅力的自拍，卢梭在便签应用里写下的奇怪的长篇大论，然后截图发出来。
那肯定很有趣。

无论如何，18世纪参加沙龙的人通常都是伟大的读者，或者是对最新的商品和时尚进行尝试的人。
实际上，就像当代有影响力的人一样。

在时尚方面，像伏尔泰这样的男士现在不再从宫廷中寻找时尚灵感，而是佩戴用印度（India）棉布制成的手帕，围在脖子上，这种手帕很快就演变成了领带。
他们还穿着长袍（banyans）——也就是宽松的类似浴袍的衣服——不需要传统上男士所穿的紧身胸衣。
正如卢梭所认为的，男士应该去掉妆容、假发和高跟鞋，回归自然——就像世界其他地方的人那样。
就像在乡村中自然状态下的人，穿着长袍，戴着羽毛帽子。

变革的气息弥漫在每个人周围，而不仅仅是精英阶层。
例如，尽管在法国进口外国棉布仍然是非法的，但现在许多人都穿着它们，包括仆人，他们会得到主人丢弃的颜色鲜艳且易于保持干净的棉布裙子或衬衫。

为了帮助人们学习，出现了更多的书籍。
比如在法国，有《百科全书》（Encyclopédie，你们会注意到我超棒的法语发音）。
它提供了对诸如自然权利和女性地位等话题的讨论。
它的主编德尼·狄德罗（Denis Diderot）写道：“所有的事物都必须毫无例外地接受审视、辩论和调查，且不必顾及任何人的感受。”
狄德罗支持社会和政治改革。
但《百科全书》——知道吗，我还是把它翻译一下——《百科全书》，也包含了机械的技术图纸，包括采矿机械。
这反映了实用价值，也激发了欧洲的创造力和日益增长的繁荣。
此外，由于煤炭的缘故，原本就相当重要的采矿业即将变得极其重要。

总的来说，启蒙运动的目标更多地是关注世俗而非精神层面。
在苏格兰（Scotland），哲学家大卫·休谟（David Hume）推崇理性高于宗教，得出结论认为对上帝的信仰仅仅是迷信。
一些被称为自然神论者（Deists）的人认为上帝是存在的，但他在让宇宙这台机器运转起来之后，就不再影响日常生活了。
美国（United States）的许多重要“开国元勋”都是自然神论者，而且如果你像许多哲学家一样认为上帝与人类事务保持距离，那么因宗教信仰而迫害他人就开始显得像是残忍的狂热行为。

一些哲学家成为了活动家。
例如，伏尔泰对让·卡拉斯（Jean Calas）遭受的折磨感到愤怒，卡拉斯被指控为了阻止儿子皈依天主教（Catholicism）而谋杀了他的儿子。
（实际上卡拉斯的儿子是因为赌债而自杀的。）
卡拉斯遭受了水刑，他身体的每一根骨头都被打断，最终在折磨中死去。
后面有骨头吗？
好吧，听着。
这是一根股骨。
我觉得这不是一根真正的股骨，我觉得这像是……复制品——斯坦，这是一根真的股骨吗？
这不是一根真的股骨。

所以我问了我们才华横溢的编剧邦妮（Bonnie），卡拉斯是不是真的每根骨头都被打断了，她回答说：“很难知道他们是不是打断了每一根。” 然后她向我详细描述了卡拉斯所遭受的折磨，这让我得出两个结论：第一，他们很可能确实打断了他身体的每一根骨头；第二，天哪，18世纪欧洲的酷刑太可怕了。

所以，关于这件事我最后要说的是：如果你发明了一台时间机器，而且我绝对相信你能做到，在大概2003年之前的时间就别回去了，好吗？
别误会我的意思——现在的情况也不好，但要记住：以前的情况糟糕得多。

说到可怕的事情，我们来谈谈奴隶制（slavery）。
所以，启蒙运动的观点也推动了英国（Britain）、法国、荷兰（Netherlands）及其殖民地中日益兴起的废除奴隶制的运动。
到这个时候，奴隶贸易规模巨大，人们也越来越认识到它的残酷性。
1770年，法国天主教神父（abbé，或神职人员）纪尧姆·雷纳尔（Guillaume Raynal）阐述了欧洲人入侵对当地原住民造成的暴力破坏。
1788年，获得自由的奴隶奥劳达·伊奎亚诺（Olaudah Equiano）描述了他在现今尼日利亚（Nigeria）被绑架并沦为奴隶后经历的“中间航程”（Middle Passage）。
现在，人们通常认为伊奎亚诺出生在南卡罗来纳（South Carolina），他那扣人心弦的回忆录可能是根据其他人的悲惨故事拼凑而成的。
尽管如此，这本书还是成了畅销书。
它揭示了白人对黑人的不人道行为，倡导启蒙运动所主张的所有人的自由和人权。
它也激励了自由民和奴隶为废除奴隶制而斗争。

同时，争取其他形式自由的运动也在不断发展。
苏格兰人亚当·斯密（Adam Smith）挑战了重商主义理论，该理论认为全球财富是固定的，国家只能通过从其他国家夺取财富来增加自己的财富，他反对囤积黄金、拒绝外国商品进入本国，以及维持有农奴的仅能维持生计的农业经济等观点。
他倡导制造业、劳动分工和自由贸易。
在自由或自由放任的市场中，个人会基于自身利益在经济活动中工作并与他人互动。
所有个人利益的总和将造就一个平衡、和谐且繁荣的社会。
亚当·斯密因其1776年的著作《国民财富的性质和原因的研究》（An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations）而被誉为自由市场、自由贸易和个人主义之父。
但他也反对专制主义，敦促关注社会的整体福祉。
除了他所看到的自由放任的好处之外，斯密也看到了其潜在的危害，所以他也主张制定有利于社会的政策。

另一本重要的启蒙运动著作是让 - 雅克·卢梭的《社会契约论》（The Social Contract），其开篇名句是：“人是生而自由的，却无往不在枷锁之中。”
卢梭承接了约翰·洛克（John Locke）关于个人之间签订契约以形成国家或民族的主题。
他认为，一旦国家自由形成，它就体现了集体社会中最美好的东西；因此，个人需要无条件地服从国家，因为它代表了“公意”。
如今，思想家们认为，这种对服从公意的呼吁为20世纪及以后的独裁政府埋下了种子。
但卢梭也确实强调个人情感是有价值的。

与卢梭的“公意”观点截然相反的是德国哲学家伊曼努尔·康德（Immanuel Kant）对个人理性的关注。
他著名地高呼：“敢于求知”，他推动了启蒙运动对人类思维以及每个人独立思考能力的追求，而不是仅仅服从旧有的命令和观念。
他认为，人类的思维中存在“理解范畴”，信息通过与这些范畴相互作用，从而产生纯粹理性的判断。
通过这种方式，康德与让 - 雅克·卢梭和亚当·斯密一样，对个人充满信心，我们可以将我们自己文化中的个人主义追溯到启蒙运动时期。

许多其他人也从启蒙运动思想中找到了慰藉，并将其视为行动的号召。
欧洲各地的上层阶级犹太女性发现思想的世界如此鼓舞人心，以至于她们也开始举办沙龙。
在柏林（Berlin），她们创办了这座城市14个沙龙中的9个。
哲学家兼作家摩西门德尔松（Moses Mendelssohn）利用更加宽容的氛围表达了他对欧洲犹太人未来的乐观态度。
由于启蒙运动强调理性，他相信长期以来对犹太人的迫害很快就会结束。
当然，我们现在知道事实并非如此。
而且许多剥削和压迫都是以理性思维为幌子发生的。
伪科学的“理性”被用来为从种族主义到性别歧视再到阶级制度等多种形式的结构性不平等辩护。
理性并不能证明是摆脱人类创造并边缘化局外人这种冲动的途径。

但尽管如此，启蒙运动思想仍然具有变革性，为不平等和不公正寻求世俗的解释确实在现实世界中产生了重大影响。
我的意思是，我们不再仅仅将地震视为上帝的行为。
启蒙运动对我们已经生活在一个可能的最好的世界这一观念的挑战，将帮助我们想象，并且最终生活在一个更好的世界里——尽管这个世界仍然远非完美。

感谢观看。
下次见。

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

So far, we've seen a ton of political change and continuing warfare in the midst of the seventeenth century's Little Ice Age, and history often focuses on these types of political and military stories.

But there were also other changes occurring: shifts in how people perceived the everyday world.

The linking of phenomena like earthquakes and eclipses with human events goes back a very long way, like to the beginning of our species, as does the belief that supernatural forces are deeply shaping the lives of individual humans.

For instance, in a previous video about witchcraft, we discussed how earthquake tremors in Istanbul in 1648 were seen as portents of a sultan's death a few months later.

But a century after that, a huge earthquake struck Lisbon, Portugal on All Saints' Day of 1755.

Tens of thousands of people died, many from a tsunami that followed the quake.

Now, some theologians argued this was punishment from God for the world's sins, but others pointed out that the earthquake had destroyed a lot of churches while sparing a lot of brothels.

Voltaire wrote a famous poem in response to the earthquake that included the memorable lines: "As the dying voices call out, will you dare respond to this appalling spectacle of smoking ashes with, 'This is the necessary effect of the eternal laws freely chosen by God?'"

The way Europeans were looking at the world had changed between the Istanbul earthquake and the Lisbon one: The Enlightenment was thriving.

[Intro]

So, today we want to emphasize that the Enlightenment wasn't all high-falutin' calculations of the sun's orbit or theories about the mathematical laws of the universe or, for that matter, theories about earthquake causality.

It also considered more down-to-earth situations like how people of different social classes relate to one another, how trade and manufacturing should function, and what the relationship of ordinary people should be to their government.

The Enlightenment, or Age of Light, refers to the belief that the musty old ideas needed to be exposed to rational investigation to see if they were still valuable.

The bright light of reason needed to shine on tradition.

And this momentous challenge to tradition came about during a time in which Europe was being completely transformed in many ways that are sometimes forgotten amid all the excitement about Voltaire and reason.

So let's go straight to the Thought Bubble today.

Beyond the wars and state-building we've already seen,
increasing abundance and novelty was creeping into the everyday lives of Europeans.
Coffee, tea, chocolate, tobacco, and other commodities led to experimentation.
For instance, one English housewife saw tea for the first time and thought it was meant to be baked as a kind of pie filling.
A diplomat said that tea and coffee had brought a greater "sobriety" and "civility" to everyday life in Europe.
Europe had previously been a land of famine and mere subsistence for essentially all of its history.
But now the cultivation of new foods from the Americas like potatoes and corn,
along with literally thousands of other new plants, meant that available calories were increasing,
and it also introduced the idea that maybe the world didn't have to be perpetually on the brink of starvation and catastrophe.
Also, by this time, tens of thousands of Europeans had traveled the world and had experienced other social orders firsthand.
For instance, travelers discovered that people across Asia didn't seem as quarrelsome as Europeans.
Drivers of carts did not block narrow streets for hours arguing over who had the right of way.
They politely agreed to let one or the other pass.
They also saw that not all social orders were as hierarchical as most European ones,
and that some societies even gave less weight to a person's parentage
and more to that person's individual skills and talents.
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

[[TV-Montesquieu]] One of the first ways writers criticized outmoded ways of life was to make fun of them...writers like Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu, aka Just Montesquieu.

(He really was the person to criticize outmoded ways of life because, boy, did he have an outmoded name.)

Montesquieu was a jurist who owned an estate near Bordeaux, which still makes wine under his name, and in 1721, he published the Persian Letters, in which Uzbek visitors find Europe amusing if not shocking.

The visitors, for instance, are amazed at the magic of priests who somehow perform the trick of turning wine into blood.

And although they clearly see the problems in French society, they firmly adhere to the mustiness of their own ways, such as keeping women secluded in a harem and guarded by eunuchs.

The message was that both easterners and Europeans were imperfect.

The author Voltaire -- who, slightly off topic, was very handsome. I mean, very striking eyes.

At any rate, he had similarly critical and amusing takes; his discourtesy to aristocrats eventually got him sent to the Bastille prison, in fact.

In many rollicking tales, he made fun of overweening rulers and their endless corruptions.

He valued honesty and those who lived simple lives "cultivating their gardens," as he famously put it in his satirical novel Candide (1759), which you can learn more about in Crash Course Literature.

Full of horrors and injustice, Candide appeared four years after the Lisbon earthquake, which Voltaire thought was firm evidence that we did not live in the best of all possible worlds.

To replace the old stuffy ways of monarchs and aristocrats, people needed to learn how to embrace the newly desirable traits of the Enlightenment, like being honest, and inquisitive, and open.

Swiss thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau had many ideas about education reform, for instance.

He was not a wealthy or titled person but rather was born into a watchmaking family and lived among artisans.

His best-selling novel Emile (1762) describes a boy who grows up not in a city or palace but in a countryside where one can be oneself -- a natural individual.

Instead of experiencing common rote learning, with large doses of religious and classical reading, Emile learns carpentry, and gardening, and other practical skills.

In the countryside, he behaves in the best possible way -- naturally and without pretentious airs.

Rousseau promoted what would come to be called middle-class values, like hard work, practicality, and domesticity for women.

When Emile becomes a young man, the spouse chosen for him is plump and smiling and devoted to taking care of him -- not studying or reading or practicing a craft or working hard to support the family like farm women did.

Also, she will breastfeed their children, whereas both aristocratic women and busy working women at the time commonly used wet nurses.

As with Emile's upbringing, all of this is presented as "natural."

Meanwhile, wealthy women in Europe instituted the Enlightenment salon: regular get-togethers in their homes to hear the latest idea, learn about the latest book, or meet the latest philosopher-influencer -- called a philosophe in French.

Slightly off topic, but I just love the idea of Rousseau and Voltaire as influencers.

Like, I would have loved to see their Instagram feeds.

Voltaire's smoldering selfies, Rousseau's weird rants written in the Notes app and then screenshotted.

It would have been gold.

At any rate, 18th-century salon goers were often great readers or experimenters with the latest commodities and fashion.

Just like contemporary influencers, actually.

And in terms of fashion, instead of looking to the courts for fashion inspiration, men like Voltaire now sported cottons from India made into handkerchiefs that were worn around the neck, which would soon metamorphose into the necktie.

They also sported banyans -- that is, loose bathrobe-type garments -- that did not need corsets, which men traditionally wore.

As Rousseau believed, men should take off their makeup, wigs, and high heels and be natural -- just like people did in other parts of the world.

Just natural man as he is naturally made in the countryside, wearing a banyan and a feathered hat.

Transformation was in the air for everyone, not just the elites.

Although imported foreign cottons were still illegal in France, for instance, many people now wore them, including servants, who received cast-off cotton dresses or shirts that were bright and easy to keep clean.

And to help people learn, there were many more texts.

Like in France, there was the Encyclopédie (you'll notice my amazing French pronunciation).

It provided discussions of topics such as natural rights and the status of women.

Its main editor, Denis Diderot, wrote: "All things must be examined, debated, investigated without exception and without regard for anyone's feelings."

Diderot favored social and political reform.

But the Encyclopédie -- you know what, I'm gonna just translate it -- Encyclopedia, also contained technical drawings of machinery, including machinery for mining.

And that reflected practical values and also provided a spur to inventiveness and growing prosperity in Europe.

Also, mining, which was already pretty important, was about to become EXTREMELY important, thanks to coal.

In general, Enlightenment aims were more worldly than spiritual.

In Scotland, philosopher David Hume promoted reason above religion, concluding that belief in God was mere superstition.

Some people, called Deists, argued that God existed but that he didn't influence everyday life after having set the machine of the universe in motion.

Many important "founding fathers" of the United States were deists, and if you believe, as many philosophers did, that God keeps a distance from human affairs, then the persecution of people for their religious beliefs starts to seem like cruel fanaticism.

And some philosophes became activists.

Like, Voltaire was outraged by the torture of Jean Calas, who had been accused of murdering his son to prevent him from converting to Catholicism.

(Calas's son had in fact committed suicide due to gambling debts.)

Calas was waterboarded and had every bone in his body broken before eventually dying under torture.

Is there a bone back there?

All right, listen.

This is a femur.

I don't think this is an actual femur, I think it's, like, a recreation -- Stan, is this a real femur?

It is NOT a real femur.

So I asked our brilliant writer Bonnie if Calas really had every bone in his body broken, and she responded, "It's hard to know whether they got every one," and then she described Calas's torture to me with a level of detail that led me to conclude that ONE, they probably did break every bone in his body, and TWO, oh my god, torture in 18th-century Europe was THE WORST.

So, last thing I'm going to say about this: if you invent a time machine, and I believe absolutely that you can, do not go back in time before like, maybe 2003?

Don't get me wrong -- things are bad, but remember: they used to be so much worse.

Speaking of terrible, let's talk about slavery.

So, Enlightenment views also fed into rising movements in Britain, France, the Netherlands, and their colonies to abolish slavery.

By this time, the slave trade was massive, and there was growing acknowledgement of its cruelties.

In 1770, the French Catholic abbé (or clergyman) Guillaume Raynal laid out the violent devastation of native peoples by invading Europeans.

And in 1788, the freed slave Olaudah Equiano described the Middle Passage after he had been kidnapped in present-day Nigeria and enslaved.

Now, Equiano is often believed to have been born in South Carolina, and his riveting memoir may have been cobbled together from the harrowing tales of others.

Still, it was a bestseller.

It captured the inhumanity of whites towards blacks, advocated Enlightenment freedom and human rights for all.

It also stirred freedmen and slaves to struggle for abolition.

And there was also growing movements for other kinds of freedom.

The Scotsman Adam Smith took on the mercantilist theory that global wealth was static and states could only increase wealth by taking it from others when he rejected ideas about stockpiling gold, and refusing entry of goods into one's country, and also remaining a subsistence agricultural economy with serfs.

He advocated for manufacturing, the division of labor, and free trade.

In a free or laissez-faire market, an individual would work and interact with others in the economy on the basis of their self-interest.

And the sum of all self-interests would make for a balanced, harmonious, and prosperous society.

Smith is best known as the father of the free market, free trade, and individualism thanks to his 1776 book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations.

But he also opposed absolutism and urged concern for the overall well-being of society.

In addition to the benefits of laissez-faire that he saw, Smith saw the potential harms, so he also argued for healing social policies.

Another important Enlightenment book was Jean-Jacques Rousseau's The Social Contract, which famously begins, "Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains."

Rousseau picked up on John Locke's theme of the contract that individuals made with one another to form a state or nation.

And he believed that once freely formed, the state embodied the best that was in the collective community; thus, individuals needed to give the state unconditional obedience because it represented the "general will."

Today, thinkers see that this call for obedience to the general will planted the seeds of dictatorial governments in the twentieth century and beyond.

But Rousseau did also emphasize individual sentiments as valuable.

At the opposite end of Rousseau's "general will" was German philosopher Immanuel Kant's attention to individual reason.

He famously exclaimed, "Dare to Know," as he advanced the Enlightenment's commitment to the human mind and the ability of every person to think for themselves instead of simply obeying old commands and ideas.

The human mind, he argued, housed "categories of understanding" with which information interacted to produce purely rational judgments.

And in this way, Kant shared the faith in the individual of both Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith, and we can trace our own culture's individualism back to the Enlightenment.

And many other individuals took refuge in Enlightenment thought as well as taking it as a call to action.

Upper-class Jewish women across Europe found the world of ideas so inspiring that they began salons, too.

In Berlin, they established nine of the fourteen salons in the city.

And philosopher and author Moses Mendelssohn used the more tolerant atmosphere to express his optimism about the future of Jews in Europe.

Because of the Enlightenment emphasis on reason, he believed that the age-old persecution of Jews would soon end.

Of course, we now know that that wasn't the case.

And much exploitation and oppression has taken place in the guise of reasoned thought.

Pseudoscientific "reason" has been used to justify many forms of structural inequality, from racism to sexism to class systems.

Rationality would not prove to be a way out of the human urge to create and marginalize outsiders.

But Enlightenment thought was nonetheless transformative, and seeking worldly explanations for inequality and injustice did have significant real-world consequences.

I mean, no longer would we see earthquakes merely as acts of God.

Enlightenment challenges to the idea that we already were living in the best of all possible worlds would help us to imagine, and eventually live in, better worlds -- albeit ones that are still profoundly imperfect.

Thanks for watching.

I'll see you next time.
