Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

And as we saw last week, Absolutism 专制主义 was in the air during the seventeenth century, but not just in France.
Across the English Channel 英吉利海峡, King James VI of Scotland became King James I of England after the death of the childless Elizabeth in 1603, and he found himself thinking, "You know, I might not agree with everything those French Catholics believe, but they are onto something 发现某事的要点 when it comes to the Divine Right of kings 君权神授 to have absolute power 绝对权力."
The inhabitants 居民 of the British Isles 不列颠群岛, however, weren't so sure.
In fact, Protestant reformers 新教改革者 were imagining a different idea of government.
That's right, my friends.
The constitutions 宪法 are coming.

[Intro]
So, when he inherited 继承 the British throne 王位, James aspired to 渴望 unite his holdings 领地 in Wales, England, Scotland, and Ireland into a more cohesive 有凝聚力的 whole, but of course those regions, despite their geographic proximity 地理上的邻近, contain quite a lot of religious, ethnic 民族的, and economic diversity 多样性.
Religiously, Calvinists (called Presbyterians 长老会教友 in Scotland), Catholics, and Anglicans 英国圣公会教徒 had big disagreements.
Also, if you've ever been to a Scottish bar and accidentally said how much you're enjoying your visit to England, you will know that Scottish people are not English.
True story by the way.
The entire bar went quiet all at once.
It was really uncomfortable.
And then I tried to fill that silence by saying, "Well, you have the same money."
Which also didn't go over great 顺利进行.
James thought he could solve these problems by taking the title of King of Great Britain -- one place, one king.
He also had his officials institute 实行 English laws across all his kingdoms and promote adherence to 坚持 Anglicanism 英国国教.
And he sought to keep the peace among Europe's great families by marrying his son, Charles, to Henrietta Maria, the Catholic sister of France's Louis XIII, but that only ended up furthering divisions 加剧分裂, because Henrietta Maria refused to convert 改信宗教 and became a target for opponents from various factions 派别.
Henrietta Maria's husband, James's son Charles came to the throne 登基 in 1625, and he too firmly believed in the divine right of kings.
Because, you know, of course he did.
He was backed by 得到…支持 the nobility 贵族 and about half of the gentry 绅士, or wealthy landowners 富有的土地所有者, below the nobility.
But other members of the gentry opposed the idea of absolutist monarchical power 专制君主权力, including the other half of the gentry, many less powerful farmers, and much of the merchant classes 商人阶层, who tended to live in cities.
These groups had no titles or ancient claims to land 古老的土地所有权主张, but they were driving much of Britain's economy, and they felt the elected English Parliament 议会 should have more power.
Because of course, that would mean that they had more power.
In 1628, Charles bowed to 屈服于 that parliamentary strength by agreeing to the Petition of Right 权利请愿书, which said that the King couldn't raise taxes without parliament's permission.
But then he was, like, I think I might have found a loophole 漏洞, and he basically ghosted them 对他们置之不理.
He simply stopped calling parliament back into session 召开议会, which of course infuriated 激怒 Parliament and also felt like a rather blatant 公然的 absolutist move from a King who'd just agreed to a check on his power 对他权力的制衡.
Meanwhile, Puritans 清教徒, who objected to 反对 the pomp 华丽；盛况 of Anglicanism with its statues 雕像 and stained glass 彩色玻璃 and incense 熏香, resisted the archbishop of Canterbury 坎特伯雷大主教, named William Laud, who was attempting to bring the Puritans back to Anglican orthodoxy 英国国教正统.
Puritan critics were tortured 折磨, put into the stocks 戴上足枷, whipped 鞭打, and had their faces mutilated 毁容, as were members of the upper classes who disapproved of 不赞成 the king and his administration 政府.
Then Laud stirred up 激起 defiance 反抗 among the Presbyterians in Scotland, whom he aimed to restore to Anglicanism.
He pushed them to adopt a new version of the Prayer Book of the Anglican Church 英国国教祈祷书; and resistance to that was literally riotous 暴乱的.
Young women hurled 投掷 the new prayer books during religious services and provoked 激起 the congregation 会众 to join them.
In fact, the Presbyterian Scots were eventually so enraged 愤怒的 that they invaded England.
In reaction, after more than a decade of refusing to summon 召集 Parliament, Charles was like, "Oh uh, Parliament, can you come back, please.
I need your support in declaring war 宣战."
Like many a ruler, Charles I thought that warfare, which he undertook on numerous occasions 多次进行, would make Parliament rally around him 团结在他周围 and allow him to raise taxes.
But that was a big mistake.
Instead, the representatives instead responded by removing Laud from power 罢黜劳德, decreeing 颁布 that Parliament must meet at least every three years, and putting additional roadblocks in Charles' way 给查理设置更多障碍.
When Charles called on soldiers to arrest the members of Parliament who had thwarted 阻挠 his demands, outright civil war 全面内战 erupted.
Between 1642 and 1646 those loyal to the king, called Cavaliers 保皇党, faced off against 对抗 those loyal to Parliament, called Roundheads 圆颅党 (because of their short haircuts).
Parliamentary forces raised the New Model Army 新模范军, led by Oliver Cromwell.
And this new army saw opposing religious sects 教派 let go of 放下 their differences, which allowed them ultimately to capture Charles I, and then execute 处决 him in 1649.
We also have to remember that during these years, the little ice age was taking its toll 造成破坏.
Many people died from famine 饥荒; furthermore, between 1625 and 1636 the bubonic plague 黑死病 killed some 45,000 people in London alone.
Amid successive bad weather 连续的恶劣天气, entire villages disappeared as their inhabitants either died of illness or starvation 饥饿, or else abandoned their communities in search of food.
And all of this enhanced the resistance and criticism of those who found it impossible to pay more taxes so that Charles could realize his absolutist dreams 实现他的专制梦想 and fight his wars.
A higher percentage of Britain's population died in this period than during both World War I and II combined.
But with the war ended, and Charles defeated, England was now a republic 共和国, although not quite like contemporary Republics, since it was ruled by the increasingly dictatorial 独裁的 Oliver Cromwell.
Although come to think of it, that does make it like some contemporary republics.
Cromwell was still the head of the New Model Army.
But without a shared enemy in the King, all those varying sects and religious factions 宗教派别 went back to squabbling with each other 互相争吵 until Cromwell wiped out 消灭 those in the New Model Army who objected to the policies of his Puritan regime 清教徒政权.
Cromwell's army crushed the Catholics in Ireland, whom it was suspected favored a restored monarchy 复辟君主制, but even so, Cromwell could not keep his army or government unified 统一, despite building a very impressive network of spies 间谍网.
In 1658, after less than a decade in power, Cromwell died, and as Civil War once more seemed inevitable 不可避免的, in 1660, Parliament summoned Charles II to the throne.
Did the center of the World just open?
Is there a wig 假发 in there?
Am I going to have to put that on, Stan?
So this was the time in English history that the wigs that I, at least, associate with 把…和…联系起来 English history, and fancy British people started to be a thing.
What purpose did they serve?
Well, then as now, they were a way of concealing hair loss 掩盖脱发, but also people liked to cut their hair short to minimize the risk of lice 减少生虱子的风险.
So now I'm worried that this wig Stan gave me has lice, and we're gonna move on with the video.
So Charles II was summoned to be the English King.
And you might be wondering why someone who'd seen his father executed for being King Charles I would want to become King Charles II, but humans are moths that fly toward the light of power 飞蛾扑火般追求权力, my friends, and Charles II thought he could be a better king.
In some ways he was; his reign began the so-called "Restoration" 复辟时期 -- a time of creativity and discovery, and also further tragedy.
In 1665, another outbreak of plague 瘟疫爆发 quickly killed some thirty thousand people; the next year, fire broke out in London destroying more than 10,000 buildings, including many churches and businesses.
The Monument to the Great Fire of London 伦敦大火纪念碑 encapsulates 概括；体现 just how thoroughly religious disagreements shaped every facet 方面 of human life.
Even when memorializing the dead 纪念死者, the monument's inscribers 刻写者 couldn't help but make it sectarian 宗派的, writing, "Here by permission of heaven, hell broke loose upon this Protestant city...
The most dreadful Burning of this City, begun and carried on by treachery 背叛 and malic 恶意 of the Popish faction 天主教派别."
Now of course that wasn't true.
The fire started in a bakery run by an Anglican.
Charles II, meanwhile, had a Catholic mother in Henrietta Maria, and was seen to be gravitating toward 倾向于 what that monument called "The Pope-ish faction."
He loosened restrictions on 放宽对…的限制 Catholics and other dissenters 持不同政见者, a move Parliament responded to with the Test Act of 1673 1673年宗教考查法, which excluded 排除 all those who weren't loyal to the Anglican Church from government positions 政府职位.
So just for a quick recap 回顾: James I tried to unite all of Great Britain and Ireland under own absolutist crown 专制统治 before dying in 1625; his son Charles I ended being up on the losing side of the English Civil War 英国内战 and was separated from his head in 1649, at which point Britain technically became a republic that more closely resembled a military dictatorship 军事独裁, which eventually failed leading in 1660 to Charles II becoming king.
Charles II had at least twelve children, but none with his wife, so his rightful heir 合法继承人 was his brother James, a Catholic, who would eventually become king, but only for a few years.
But before we get there, let's go to the Thought Bubble.
Across these decades people saw the social order "turned upside down" 颠倒
as some male reformers proposed free love 自由恋爱 and women took up arms 拿起武器,
even carrying them openly during the 1640s and 1650s.
One pro-parliament woman recalled seeing the leader of the Irish rebels approaching,
writing that she "sent him a shot in the head that made him bid the world goodnight."[1]
Other women began publishing and preaching 布道,
with Quaker women 贵格会女性 emphasizing the divine light shining from all humans,
both male and female.
And with the political scene fluctuating so rapidly 政治局势迅速波动 and alliances changing 联盟变化,
women served many roles, including as spies 间谍,
even going to other countries to gather intelligence 收集情报
on those plotting to restore the monarchy 密谋复辟君主制
or, when it was restored,
those plotting to overthrow it again 密谋再次推翻它.
Among these was Aphra Behn,
daughter of a butcher and midwife 助产士.
She was pro-Stuart 支持斯图亚特家族的
-- the family name of James and Charles --
and traveled incognito 隐姓埋名地 to the Netherlands in the 1660s
to gather intelligence on Stuart enemies.
However, Behn picked up another career 从事另一份职业,
soon becoming a popular playwright 剧作家, at a time when
-- as part of the world turning upside down --
women began going to the theater and serving as actresses 女演员
(before that men had taken women's roles in plays).
In 1688, the year before she died,
Behn published *Oroonoko*,
the story of a wrongly enslaved African prince
and his love for a high-born slave woman.
In this regard, Behn was part of a thriving Restoration literary scene 繁荣的复辟时期文学界,
which rejected puritan austerity 清教徒的简朴 in favor of 支持 wit 机智, sexual desire 性欲 and playfulness 嬉戏.
Thanks Thought Bubble.

So, despite the efforts of Aphra Behn and her ilk 之流, the Stuart drive for absolutism 斯图亚特家族对专制主义的追求 halted for good 永远停止 in between 1688 and 1689, when the Catholic ways of James II became too much for the pro-Parliament advocates 支持议会的人士 and when, to compound the danger 加剧危险, James' second wife gave birth to a son and heir 生下儿子兼继承人.
James' older daughter Mary and her spouse William III were summoned as monarchs 被召来成为君主 to replace James II, but only after they had agreed to rule by a Bill of Rights 权利法案.
This document stated in its first article that no monarch would reject or publish a decree 法令 without the consent of Parliament 议会同意.
It also guaranteed 保障 some of the rights that were later found in the U.S. Bill of Rights 美国权利法案, including, for instance, the right to bear arms 携带武器的权利 -- at least as long as you were Protestant 新教徒.
And it's important to note that political theory 政治理论 underpinned 支撑 this political transformation 政治变革, which came to be called the "Glorious Revolution" 光荣革命.
And this is the part in European history where we usually talk about Thomas Hobbes and John Locke.
Thomas Hobbes took a very pessimistic view of 对…持悲观态度 human nature 人性 and argued for 主张 an absolutist form of political organization 专制政治组织形式 in his book *Leviathan*《利维坦》.
It argued that a lack of political regulation 缺乏政治监管 created lives that were "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."
In Hobbes' worldview 在霍布斯的世界观中 with absolute rule 专制统治, one surrendered 放弃 any claim to personal liberty 个人自由主张 but received in exchange 作为交换获得 a measure of personal well-being 一定程度的个人幸福 and protection from that absolutist government.
But there was another famous English theorist of government and human society 政府和人类社会理论家, John Locke, who presented a rosier view 更乐观的观点 in his *Two Treatises of Government*《政府论两篇》.
Locke argued that in a natural world, individuals were born free and equal 生而自由平等, but that they rationally 理性地 banded together 联合起来 to create a government that would uphold laws 维护法律 and protect their rights 保护他们的权利.
So Locke is seen as articulating 阐述 a theory of government similar to the one put forth by 提出 the Glorious Revolution -- and also similar to the one outlined in the preamble to 序言 the U.S. Constitution 美国宪法.
And in many ways, Locke's political thought 政治思想 has been seen as the foundation of traditional or classical liberalism 传统或古典自由主义 -- that is, the belief in rights and freedom as intrinsic to 与生俱来的 the human self.
And we see this theory amplified 扩大影响 from Locke's time down to the present day.
Like, today, many of us take it for granted that 想当然地认为 humans have certain natural rights 自然权利 -- including the rights to life, liberty, and property 生命、自由和财产权, language taken directly from *Two Treatises*.
But human rights 人权 are an invented concept 发明的概念 -- albeit 尽管 a very useful one.
King Henry VIII, for instance did not agree with the notion that 不同意…的观点 those who claim to own land actually owned it, as evidenced by 由…证明 his extensive reclamation of Catholic land 大量收回天主教土地 for himself.
The creation of concepts of human rights reminds us again that how we imagine the world -- and indeed how we imagine ourselves and each other -- deeply impacts 深刻影响 the world in which we end up living.
Whether we believe in human rights -- and how we act on that belief -- has profound consequences 深远影响 today, just as it did in The Glorious Revolution.
Next week we're gonna cross back to the continent 回到欧洲大陆 to see the Dutch variant on constitutional government 荷兰式立宪政府, including all its twists and turns 曲折变化 AND CANNIBALISM 食人现象.
Thanks for watching, I'll see you then.

== 中文释义

大家好，我是约翰·格林，这里是《速成欧洲史》。

正如我们上周所看到的，17世纪时专制主义盛行，而且并非只在法国如此。

在英吉利海峡对岸，1603年无嗣的伊丽莎白（Elizabeth）去世后，苏格兰国王詹姆斯六世（King James VI）成为了英格兰国王詹姆斯一世（King James I），他心想：“你知道吗，我可能并不认同那些法国天主教徒的所有信仰，但在国王拥有绝对权力的神授君权这一点上，他们说得有道理。”

然而，不列颠群岛的居民却不这么认为。

事实上，新教改革者们构想了一种不同的政府理念。

没错，朋友们。

宪法时代要来了。

[开场介绍]
所以，詹姆斯继承英国王位后，渴望将他在威尔士、英格兰、苏格兰和爱尔兰的领地联合成一个更紧密的整体，但当然，这些地区尽管地理位置相近，却在宗教、民族和经济方面存在着很大的差异。

在宗教方面，加尔文主义者（在苏格兰被称为长老会信徒）、天主教徒和英国国教徒之间存在着很大的分歧。

而且，如果你去过一家苏格兰酒吧，不小心说你多么享受在英格兰的旅行，你就会知道苏格兰人可不是英格兰人。

顺便说一下，这是真实发生的事。

整个酒吧一下子安静了下来。

真的非常尴尬。

然后我试图打破沉默，就说：“嗯，你们用的是同一种货币。”

结果这话效果也不太好。

詹姆斯认为他可以通过采用“大不列颠国王”这一头衔来解决这些问题——一个地方，一位国王。

他还让他的官员在他的所有王国中推行英格兰法律，并促进人们遵守英国国教教义。

他试图通过让自己的儿子查理（Charles）与法国路易十三（Louis XIII）的天主教妹妹亨丽埃塔·玛丽亚（Henrietta Maria）结婚，来维持欧洲各大家族之间的和平，但这最终只是加剧了分裂，因为亨丽埃塔·玛丽亚拒绝改信英国国教，成了各个派系反对者的攻击目标。

亨丽埃塔·玛丽亚的丈夫，詹姆斯的儿子查理于1625年登上王位，他也坚信国王的神授君权。

毕竟，他当然会这样认为。

他得到了贵族以及大约一半绅士（即贵族之下的富有的土地所有者）的支持。

但其他绅士成员反对专制君主权力的理念，其中包括另一半绅士、许多势力较弱的农民，以及大多居住在城市的商人阶层。

这些群体没有贵族头衔，也没有对土地的古老所有权主张，但他们推动着英国经济的很大一部分发展，他们觉得选举产生的英国议会应该拥有更多权力。

因为，当然了，这意味着他们自己会拥有更多权力。

1628年，查理迫于议会的压力，同意了《权利请愿书》（Petition of Right），该请愿书规定，国王未经议会许可不得征税。

但随后，他就好像在想，我可能找到了一个漏洞，然后基本上就对议会不理不睬了。

他干脆不再召集议会开会，这当然激怒了议会，而且对于一位刚刚同意对自己权力进行制约的国王来说，这一行为显得相当明目张胆，是专制主义的做法。

与此同时，清教徒们反对英国国教那些华丽的装饰，比如雕像、彩色玻璃窗和熏香，他们抵制坎特伯雷大主教威廉·劳德（William Laud），劳德试图让清教徒回归英国国教的正统教义。

清教徒批评者们遭到了折磨，被戴上足枷、鞭笞，面部也被毁容，那些不赞成国王及其政府的上层阶级成员也遭遇了同样的待遇。

然后，劳德激起了苏格兰长老会信徒的反抗，他的目标是让他们重新皈依英国国教。

他促使他们采用英国国教新版的《祈祷书》；而对这一举措的抵制简直演变成了暴乱。

年轻女子在宗教仪式上把新的祈祷书扔出去，并煽动会众加入她们。

事实上，苏格兰的长老会信徒最终非常愤怒，以至于他们入侵了英格兰。

作为回应，在拒绝召集议会十多年后，查理表示：“哦，嗯，议会，请你们回来吧。我需要你们支持我宣战。”

和许多统治者一样，查理一世（Charles I）认为，他多次发动的战争会让议会团结在他周围，并允许他提高税收。

但这是个大错特错的想法。

相反，议员们的回应是解除了劳德的权力，颁布法令规定议会至少每三年必须召开一次会议，并给查理设置了更多障碍。

当查理号召士兵逮捕那些阻挠他要求的议会成员时，一场彻底的内战爆发了。

在1642年至1646年间，效忠于国王的人（被称为“骑士党”Cavaliers）与效忠于议会的人（被称为“圆颅党”Roundheads，因为他们的发型很短）展开了对抗。

议会军组建了新模范军（New Model Army），由奥利弗·克伦威尔（Oliver Cromwell）领导。

这支新军队让对立的宗教派别放下了分歧，最终使他们得以俘虏查理一世，并于1649年将他处决。

我们还得记住，在这些年里，小冰期也造成了很大影响。

许多人死于饥荒；此外，在1625年至1636年间，仅在伦敦，黑死病就导致约4.5万人死亡。

在接连不断的恶劣天气中，整个村庄都消失了，村民们要么死于疾病或饥饿，要么为了寻找食物而离开了他们的社区。

所有这些都加剧了人们的反抗和批评，他们觉得不可能再缴纳更多的税，好让查理实现他的专制梦想并发动战争。

在这一时期，英国人口的死亡率比第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战期间的死亡率总和还要高。

但随着战争结束，查理被击败，英格兰现在成了一个共和国，不过它和当代的共和国不太一样，因为它是由日益独裁的奥利弗·克伦威尔统治的。

不过仔细想想，这确实和一些当代的共和国有点像。

克伦威尔仍然是新模范军的首领。

但没有了国王这个共同的敌人，所有那些不同的教派和宗教派别又开始互相争吵，直到克伦威尔清除了新模范军中那些反对他清教徒政权政策的人。

克伦威尔的军队镇压了爱尔兰的天主教徒，人们怀疑这些天主教徒支持复辟君主制，但即便如此，克伦威尔也无法使他的军队或政府保持团结，尽管他建立了一个非常庞大的间谍网络。

1658年，在掌权不到十年后，克伦威尔去世了，随着内战似乎再次不可避免，1660年，议会召回查理二世（Charles II）登上王位。

世界的中心是不是又打开了？
里面有一顶假发吗？
斯坦，我是不是得戴上那顶假发啊？
所以在英国历史上的这个时期，至少在我看来，与英国历史以及那些讲究的英国人联系在一起的假发开始流行起来了。
它们有什么作用呢？
嗯，当时和现在一样，它们是一种掩盖脱发的方式，但同时人们也喜欢把头发剪短，以尽量减少长虱子的风险。
所以现在我担心斯坦给我的这顶假发有虱子，我们继续讲视频内容吧。

所以查理二世被召回成为了英国国王。 +
你可能会想，看到自己的父亲查理一世作为国王被处决，为什么还会有人想成为查理二世呢，但朋友们，人类就像飞蛾扑火一样追逐着权力的光芒，查理二世认为他可以成为一个更好的国王。 +
在某些方面他确实做到了；他的统治开启了所谓的“复辟时期”——一个充满创造力和新发现的时期，但同时也伴随着更多的悲剧。 +
1665年，又一次瘟疫爆发，迅速夺走了约三万人的生命；第二年，伦敦发生大火，烧毁了一万多座建筑，其中包括许多教堂和商铺。 +
伦敦大火纪念碑（The Monument to the Great Fire of London）充分体现了宗教分歧是如何深刻地影响着人类生活的方方面面。 +
即使是在纪念死者的时候，纪念碑的刻字者也忍不住让它带上了宗派色彩，上面写道：“在这里，经上天允许，地狱降临到了这座新教城市……这场城市中最可怕的大火，是由天主教派的背叛和恶意引发并蔓延的。” +
当然，这并不是真的。 +
大火是从一家由英国国教徒经营的面包店开始烧起来的。 +
与此同时，查理二世的母亲亨丽埃塔·玛丽亚是天主教徒，人们认为他逐渐倾向于那座纪念碑所指的“天主教派”。 +
他放宽了对天主教徒和其他持不同政见者的限制，议会对此的回应是在1673年通过了《宣誓法案》（Test Act），该法案将所有不忠于英国国教的人排除在政府职位之外。 +

所以快速回顾一下：詹姆斯一世（James I）试图在1625年去世前，将整个大不列颠和爱尔兰统一在自己的专制统治之下；他的儿子查理一世最终在内战中失败，并于1649年被斩首，从那时起，英国从理论上成为了一个更像是军事独裁的共和国，最终失败，导致1660年查理二世成为国王。
查理二世至少有十二个孩子，但没有一个是和他妻子生的，所以他合法的继承人是他的弟弟詹姆斯（James），一个天主教徒，他最终成为了国王，但只当了几年。

但在我们讲到那部分之前，让我们进入“思想泡泡”环节。
在这几十年里，人们看到社会秩序“颠倒了”，
一些男性改革者提倡自由恋爱，女性则拿起了武器，
甚至在17世纪40年代和50年代公开携带武器。
一位支持议会的女性回忆起看到爱尔兰叛军首领走近的情景，
她写道，她“朝他的脑袋开了一枪，让他跟这个世界说晚安了”。[1]
其他女性开始出版作品并进行布道，
贵格会的女性强调所有人，无论男女，都闪耀着神圣的光芒。
由于政治局势变化迅速，联盟也在不断改变，
女性扮演了许多角色，包括充当间谍，
甚至前往其他国家收集情报，
针对那些密谋复辟君主制的人，
或者，当君主制复辟后，
针对那些密谋再次推翻它的人。
阿芙拉·贝恩（Aphra Behn）就是其中之一，
她是一位屠夫兼助产士的女儿。
她支持斯图亚特家族（Stuart）——詹姆斯和查理的家族姓氏——
并在17世纪60年代隐姓埋名前往荷兰，
收集关于斯图亚特家族敌人的情报。
然而，贝恩又从事了另一份职业，
很快成为了一位受欢迎的剧作家，在那个时候——
作为世界颠倒的一部分——
女性开始去剧院看戏，并成为女演员
（在那之前，男性会扮演戏剧中女性的角色）。
1688年，在她去世的前一年，
贝恩出版了《奥鲁诺科》（Oroonoko），
讲述了一位被错误奴役的非洲王子
和他对一位出身高贵的女奴的爱情故事。
在这方面，贝恩是繁荣的复辟时期文学界的一员，
这个文学界摒弃了清教徒的简朴，推崇机智、性欲和戏谑。
感谢“思想泡泡”！

所以，尽管阿芙拉·贝恩和她那类人做出了努力，但斯图亚特家族对专制主义的追求在1688年至1689年间彻底停止了，当时詹姆斯二世（James II）的天主教信仰让支持议会的人无法忍受，而且更危险的是，詹姆斯的第二任妻子生下了一个儿子和继承人。
詹姆斯的长女玛丽（Mary）和她的丈夫威廉三世（William III）被召来取代詹姆斯二世成为君主，但前提是他们必须同意依据《权利法案》（Bill of Rights）进行统治。
这份文件的第一条规定，未经议会同意，任何君主不得拒绝或公布法令。
它还保障了一些后来在美国《权利法案》中出现的权利，例如持有武器的权利——至少如果你是新教徒的话。
值得注意的是，这一政治变革背后有政治理论作为支撑，这场变革后来被称为“光荣革命”（Glorious Revolution）。
在欧洲历史的这个阶段，我们通常会谈到托马斯·霍布斯（Thomas Hobbes）和约翰·洛克（John Locke）。
托马斯·霍布斯对人性持非常悲观的看法，他在《利维坦》（Leviathan）一书中主张建立一种专制主义的政治组织形式。
他认为，缺乏政治规范会导致人们的生活“孤独、贫穷、肮脏、野蛮且短暂”。
在霍布斯的世界观中，在绝对统治下，人们放弃了对个人自由的任何主张，但作为交换，从专制政府那里得到了一定程度的个人福祉和保护。
但还有另一位著名的英国政府和人类社会理论家约翰·洛克，他在《政府论两篇》（Two Treatises of Government）中提出了更为乐观的观点。
洛克认为，在自然状态下，个人生来是自由和平等的，但他们理性地联合起来建立一个政府，这个政府将维护法律并保护他们的权利。
所以洛克被认为阐述了一种与光荣革命所提出的理论相似的政府理论——也与美国宪法序言中概述的理论相似。
在很多方面，洛克的政治思想被视为传统或古典自由主义的基础——也就是说，相信权利和自由是人类自身固有的。
从洛克的时代到今天，我们可以看到这一理论得到了不断的发展。
比如，今天，我们很多人都理所当然地认为人类拥有某些自然权利——包括生命权、自由权和财产权，这些表述直接取自《政府论两篇》。
但人权是一个被创造出来的概念——尽管它非常有用。
例如，亨利八世（King Henry VIII）并不认同那些声称拥有土地的人实际上真正拥有土地的观点，从他大量收回天主教土地归为己有就可以看出这一点。
人权概念的产生再次提醒我们，我们如何想象这个世界——实际上，我们如何想象自己和他人——会深刻地影响我们最终生活的世界。
我们是否相信人权——以及我们如何依据这种信念行动——在今天有着深远的影响，就像在光荣革命时期一样。
下周我们将回到欧洲大陆，看看荷兰的立宪政府模式，包括它的所有曲折历程以及食人现象。
感谢观看，到时候见。

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

And as we saw last week, Absolutism was in the air during the seventeenth century, but not just in France.

Across the English Channel, King James VI of Scotland became King James I of England after the death of the childless Elizabeth in 1603, and he found himself thinking, "You know, I might not agree with everything those French Catholics believe, but they are onto something when it comes to the Divine Right of kings to have absolute power."

The inhabitants of the British Isles, however, weren't so sure.

In fact, Protestant reformers were imagining a different idea of government.

That's right, my friends.

The constitutions are coming.

[Intro]
So, when he inherited the British throne, James aspired to unite his holdings in Wales, England, Scotland, and Ireland into a more cohesive whole, but of course those regions, despite their geographic proximity, contain quite a lot of religious, ethnic, and economic diversity.

Religiously, Calvinists (called Presbyterians in Scotland), Catholics, and Anglicans had big disagreements.

Also, if you've ever been to a Scottish bar and accidentally said how much you're enjoying your visit to England, you will know that Scottish people are not English.

True story by the way.

The entire bar went quiet all at once.

It was really uncomfortable.

And then I tried to fill that silence by saying, "Well, you have the same money."

Which also didn't go over great.

James thought he could solve these problems by taking the title of King of Great Britain -- one place, one king.

He also had his officials institute English laws across all his kingdoms and promote adherence to Anglicanism.

And he sought to keep the peace among Europe's great families by marrying his son, Charles, to Henrietta Maria, the Catholic sister of France's Louis XIII, but that only ended up furthering divisions, because Henrietta Maria refused to convert and became a target for opponents from various factions.

Henrietta Maria's husband, James's son Charles came to the throne in 1625, and he too firmly believed in the divine right of kings.

Because, you know, of course he did.

He was backed by the nobility and about half of the gentry, or wealthy landowners, below the nobility.

But other members of the gentry opposed the idea of absolutist monarchical power, including the other half of the gentry, many less powerful farmers, and much of the merchant classes, who tended to live in cities.

These groups had no titles or ancient claims to land, but they were driving much of Britain's economy, and they felt the elected English Parliament should have more power.

Because of course, that would mean that they had more power.

In 1628, Charles bowed to that parliamentary strength by agreeing to the Petition of Right, which said that the King couldn't raise taxes without parliament's permission.

But then he was, like, I think I might have found a loophole, and he basically ghosted them.

He simply stopped calling parliament back into session, which of course infuriated Parliament and also felt like a rather blatant absolutist move from a King who'd just agreed to a check on his power.

Meanwhile, Puritans, who objected to the pomp of Anglicanism with its statues and stained glass and incense, resisted the archbishop of Canterbury, named William Laud, who was attempting to bring the Puritans back to Anglican orthodoxy.

Puritan critics were tortured, put into the stocks, whipped, and had their faces mutilated, as were members of the upper classes who disapproved of the king and his administration.

Then Laud stirred up defiance among the Presbyterians in Scotland, whom he aimed to restore to Anglicanism.

He pushed them to adopt a new version of the Prayer Book of the Anglican Church; and resistance to that was literally riotous.

Young women hurled the new prayer books during religious services and provoked the congregation to join them.

In fact, the Presbyterian Scots were eventually so enraged that they invaded England.

In reaction, after more than a decade of refusing to summon Parliament, Charles was like, "Oh uh, Parliament, can you come back, please.

I need your support in declaring war."

Like many a ruler, Charles I thought that warfare, which he undertook on numerous occasions, would make Parliament rally around him and allow him to raise taxes.

But that was a big mistake.

Instead, the representatives instead responded by removing Laud from power, decreeing that Parliament must meet at least every three years, and putting additional roadblocks in Charles' way.

When Charles called on soldiers to arrest the members of Parliament who had thwarted his demands, outright civil war erupted.

Between 1642 and 1646 those loyal to the king, called Cavaliers, faced off against those loyal to Parliament, called Roundheads (because of their short haircuts).

Parliamentary forces raised the New Model Army, led by Oliver Cromwell.

And this new army saw opposing religious sects let go of their differences, which allowed them ultimately to capture Charles I, and then execute him in 1649.

We also have to remember that during these years, the little ice age was taking its toll.

Many people died from famine; furthermore, between 1625 and 1636 the bubonic plague killed some 45,000 people in London alone.

Amid successive bad weather, entire villages disappeared as their inhabitants either died of illness or starvation, or else abandoned their communities in search of food.

And all of this enhanced the resistance and criticism of those who found it impossible to pay more taxes so that Charles could realize his absolutist dreams and fight his wars.

A higher percentage of Britain's population died in this period than during both World War I and II combined.

But with the war ended, and Charles defeated, England was now a republic, although not quite like contemporary Republics, since it was ruled by the increasingly dictatorial Oliver Cromwell.

Although come to think of it, that does make it like some contemporary republics.

Cromwell was still the head of the New Model Army.

But without a shared enemy in the King, all those varying sects and religious factions went back to squabbling with each other until Cromwell wiped out those in the New Model Army who objected to the policies of his Puritan regime.

Cromwell's army crushed the Catholics in Ireland, whom it was suspected favored a restored monarchy, but even so, Cromwell could not keep his army or government unified, despite building a very impressive network of spies.

In 1658, after less than a decade in power, Cromwell died, and as Civil War once more seemed inevitable, in 1660, Parliament summoned Charles II to the throne.

Did the center of the World just open?

Is there a wig in there?

Am I going to have to put that on, Stan?

So this was the time in English history that the wigs that I, at least, associate with English history, and fancy British people started to be a thing.

What purpose did they serve?

Well, then as now, they were a way of concealing hair loss, but also people liked to cut their hair short to minimize the risk of lice.

So now I'm worried that this wig Stan gave me has lice, and we're gonna move on with the video.

So Charles II was summoned to be the English King.

And you might be wondering why someone who'd seen his father executed for being King Charles I would want to become King Charles II, but humans are moths that fly toward the light of power, my friends, and Charles II thought he could be a better king.

In some ways he was; his reign began the so-called "Restoration" -- a time of creativity and discovery, and also further tragedy.

In 1665, another outbreak of plague quickly killed some thirty thousand people; the next year, fire broke out in London destroying more than 10,000 buildings, including many churches and businesses.

The Monument to the Great Fire of London encapsulates just how thoroughly religious disagreements shaped every facet of human life.

Even when memorializing the dead, the monument's inscribers couldn't help but make it sectarian, writing, "Here by permission of heaven, hell broke loose upon this Protestant city...

The most dreadful Burning of this City, begun and carried on by treachery and malic of the Popish faction."

Now of course that wasn't true.

The fire started in a bakery run by an Anglican.

Charles II, meanwhile, had a Catholic mother in Henrietta Maria, and was seen to be gravitating toward what that monument called "The Pope-ish faction."

He loosened restrictions on Catholics and other dissenters, a move Parliament responded to with the Test Act of 1673, which excluded all those who weren't loyal to the Anglican Church from government positions.

So just for a quick recap: James I tried to unite all of Great Britain and Ireland under own absolutist crown before dying in 1625; his son Charles I ended being up on the losing side of the English Civil War and was separated from his head in 1649, at which point Britain technically became a republic that more closely resembled a military dictatorship, which eventually failed leading in 1660 to Charles II becoming king.

Charles II had at least twelve children, but none with his wife, so his rightful heir was his brother James, a Catholic, who would eventually become king, but only for a few years.

But before we get there, let's go to the Thought Bubble.

Across these decades people saw the social order "turned upside down"
as some male reformers proposed free love and women took up arms,
even carrying them openly during the 1640s and 1650s.
One pro-parliament woman recalled seeing the leader of the Irish rebels approaching,
writing that she "sent him a shot in the head that made him bid the world goodnight."[1]
Other women began publishing and preaching,
with Quaker women emphasizing the divine light shining from all humans,
both male and female.
And with the political scene fluctuating so rapidly and alliances changing,
women served many roles, including as spies,
even going to other countries to gather intelligence
on those plotting to restore the monarchy
or, when it was restored,
those plotting to overthrow it again.
Among these was Aphra Behn,
daughter of a butcher and midwife.
She was pro-Stuart
-- the family name of James and Charles --
and traveled incognito to the Netherlands in the 1660s
to gather intelligence on Stuart enemies.
However, Behn picked up another career,
soon becoming a popular playwright, at a time when
-- as part of the world turning upside down --
women began going to the theater and serving as actresses
(before that men had taken women's roles in plays).
In 1688, the year before she died,
Behn published Oroonoko,
the story of a wrongly enslaved African prince
and his love for a high-born slave woman.
In this regard, Behn was part of a thriving Restoration literary scene,
which rejected puritan austerity in favor of wit, sexual desire and playfulness.
Thanks Thought Bubble.

So, despite the efforts of Aphra Behn and her ilk, the Stuart drive for absolutism halted for good in between 1688 and 1689, when the Catholic ways of James II became too much for the pro-Parliament advocates and when, to compound the danger, James' second wife gave birth to a son and heir.

James' older daughter Mary and her spouse William III were summoned as monarchs to replace James II, but only after they had agreed to rule by a Bill of Rights.

This document stated in its first article that no monarch would reject or publish a decree without the consent of Parliament.

It also guaranteed some of the rights that were later found in the U.S. Bill of Rights, including, for instance, the right to bear arms -- at least as long as you were Protestant.

And it's important to note that political theory underpinned this political transformation, which came to be called the "Glorious Revolution."

And this is the part in European history where we usually talk about Thomas Hobbes and John Locke.

Thomas Hobbes took a very pessimistic view of human nature and argued for an absolutist form of political organization in his book Leviathan.

It argued that a lack of political regulation created lives that were "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."

In Hobbes' worldview with absolute rule, one surrendered any claim to personal liberty but received in exchange a measure of personal well-being and protection from that absolutist government.

But there was another famous English theorist of government and human society, John Locke, who presented a rosier view in his Two Treatises of Government.

Locke argued that in a natural world, individuals were born free and equal, but that they rationally banded together to create a government that would uphold laws and protect their rights.

So Locke is seen as articulating a theory of government similar to the one put forth by the Glorious Revolution -- and also similar to the one outlined in the preamble to the U.S. Constitution.

And in many ways, Locke's political thought has been seen as the foundation of traditional or classical liberalism -- that is, the belief in rights and freedom as intrinsic to the human self.

And we see this theory amplified from Locke's time down to the present day.

Like, today, many of us take it for granted that humans have certain natural rights -- including the rights to life, liberty, and property, language taken directly from Two Treatises.

But human rights are an invented concept -- albeit a very useful one.

King Henry VIII, for instance did not agree with the notion that those who claim to own land actually owned it, as evidenced by his extensive reclamation of Catholic land for himself.

The creation of concepts of human rights reminds us again that how we imagine the world -- and indeed how we imagine ourselves and each other -- deeply impacts the world in which we end up living.

Whether we believe in human rights -- and how we act on that belief -- has profound consequences today, just as it did in The Glorious Revolution.

Next week we're gonna cross back to the continent to see the Dutch variant on constitutional government, including all its twists and turns AND CANNIBALISM.

Thanks for watching, I'll see you then.
