== 释义

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History. +

So we're going to turn our attention now to the Industrial Revolution 工业革命, one of the most significant 重要的；意义重大的 developments in human history. +

Like, imagine with me that it's 1820. +

I got this idea from the economist 经济学家 Robert Gordon, by the way. +

You live in, say, England. +

You probably work in agriculture 农业. +

When you walk to town, you're either pulling your own cart, or if you're lucky you have a horse. +

You have no running water 自来水 or electricity 电. +

When you wash your few items of clothing, you do so by hand 用手. +

You cook over a fire 用火. +

You think of time not primarily 主要地 in minutes and hours, but mostly in relationship to solar cycles 太阳周期 -- how close it is to night, or to morning, or to midwinter 隆冬. +

And in all these respects 方面, your life in 1820 is basically identical to 与…基本相同 the lives of people in 1720, or 1520, or for that matter 就此而言 1220. +

That's not to say life hasn't changed in those hundreds of years -- as we've explored in this series, lots has changed -- but as Gregory Clark observed, in terms of standard of living 生活水平, Europeans in 1800 basically led lives similar to those of Neanderthals 尼安德特人. +

Now imagine that you close your eyes in 1820 and wake up in 1920. +

By now, most people in England do not work in agriculture. +

They may work in shops, or transportation 交通；运输, or mining 采矿, or workshops 作坊, or in factories 工厂. +

They measure time in minutes. +

Cars exist. +

Some people have radios 收音机, which transmitted 传输 information through thin air 无形地. +

A few people even have refrigerators 冰箱, which dramatically 显著地 decrease food spoilage 食物变质 and the risk of foodborne illness 食源性疾病. +

Occasionally 偶尔 you might even see an airplane flying in the sky. +

Oh, and also, your country has just emerged from 从…中摆脱出来 an astonishingly 惊人地 deadly war fought with highly lethal 致命的 weapons such as chlorine gas 氯气, weapons that people of 1820 could not possibly have imagined. +

Welcome to the Industrial Revolution. +

[Intro] +

In this series, we've already talked about revolutions in agriculture that increased European productivity 生产力 and revolutions in trade that increasingly distributed 分配 goods among people in towns and cities instead of having each individual family produce everything it needed. +

And these forces combined to help create more division of labor 劳动分工: like, farmers could focus on farming, and textile workers 纺织工人 could focus on textile creation 纺织品制造, which was more efficient 高效的 than having each family do every kind of work. +

So let's begin in the eighteenth century, when European industrial production 工业生产 is said to have begun. +

Europe's population was growing after centuries of non-stop 不停的 wars, plagues 瘟疫, and the worst of the little ice age 小冰河期. +

Meanwhile, products such as coffee, tea, and chocolate made with heated water killed bacteria 细菌, while products from abroad expanded and varied the pool of nutrients 营养物质, with corn 玉米 and potatoes 土豆, for instance, generally more calorie-dense 热量高的 per acre 每英亩 than wheat 小麦. +

In short 简而言之, lives were getting longer and populations rising. +

This meant that on average 平均 people had a little more time to learn, tinker 摆弄, and experiment 实验. +

Many different artisans 工匠 invented small improvements to existing mechanical devices 机械设备. +

Perhaps most famously, John Kay's flying shuttle 飞梭 increased the pace 速度 and productivity 生产率 of weaving 织布. +

Weavers then needed a greater amount of thread 线. +

So tinkerers 修补匠 made that happen by producing inventions such as the spinning jenny 珍妮纺纱机, created around 1764 by craftsman 工匠 James Hargreaves. +

The spinning jenny was a machine used by individual women working at home. +

And it allowed a person, using just the power of their hand, to spin 纺纱 not one bobbin 线轴 of thread, but up to 120 at once 同时. +

In England, Ellen Hacking and her husband John were among those devising 发明 carding machines 梳棉机 to straighten 理顺 cotton and wool fibers 纤维 for spinning. +

And at about the same time, Richard Arkwright and his partners invented the water frame 水力纺纱机, another kind of spinning machine that used water power 水力. +

And when spinning machines could be linked to a central power source 动力源 such as water, many could be placed in a single building. +

So, the world's first factories 工厂 arose 出现 in part from the pressure to increase production of English cloth for global and domestic markets 国内外市场. +

Did the center of the world just open? +

Is one of my Polo shirts in there? +

This cost like $41. +

Twice a year I go to a Polo outlet 折扣店 in Southern Indiana and just buy as many of these things as they'll sell to me. +

And look, I'm not here to advertise 宣传 Polo shirts, but this thing is incredibly comfortable 舒适的, and also, it's like dyed 染色 a specific color. +

Everything about this was completely unimaginable 难以想象的 in the early nineteenth century. +

In fact, you know what? +

It's so soft to the touch 摸起来, I think I'm going to put it on 穿上它. +

Is that weird? +

Oh yeah! +

I feel like I'm the bad guy in an 80s movie. +

How do I look, Stan? +

Oh, Stan says I look like Steve Bannon. +

OK. +

Thus ends that experiment, now back to the show. +

Let's talk about porcelain 瓷器. +

Another tinkerer 能工巧匠 was the alchemist 炼金术士 Johann Friedrich Böttger who promised the king of Saxony that he could figure out 弄清楚 how to make porcelain. +

Porcelain was such an obsession 痴迷 that wealthy people collected it and even those with far less would try to buy a piece or two -- a cup or plate -- as we see in many Dutch, French, and other paintings. +

Two things you see a lot in European paintings of the affluent 富裕的 or those who aspired to affluence 渴望富裕的: porcelain and pineapples 菠萝, which were also quite rare 稀有的 and expensive 昂贵的 and difficult to produce domestically 国内生产. +

Porcelain was also practical 实用的, because Europeans did not know other ways to make heat resistant 耐热的 dishware 餐具 for their hot drinks. +

So Böttger was virtually 几乎 imprisoned 监禁 until around 1708 when he figured out how to make porcelain, although not as beautifully as the Chinese or Japanese did. +

What we're trying to get at here is that while people love a great story of an inventor 发明家 and their invention, the Industrial Revolution was the story of lots and lots of people working together, making a series of incremental improvements 渐进式改进, rather than, like, geniuses 天才 from on high 从天而降 creating amazing things. +

The real genius of humans is collaboration 合作, and also spying 间谍活动. +

Like for instance, Industrial spies 工业间谍 helped with every development because other regions were far more advanced than Europe in manufacturing 制造业, for instance, color fast dyes 不褪色染料 and heat-resistant dishware 耐热餐具, fine weaving 精细织布 and spinning 纺纱, or even metallurgy 冶金学. +

Arkwright, for example, mostly copied designs from imported textiles 纺织品. +

And it was those cotton textiles that caught the imagination of consumers 消费者 and filled pockets 赚钱, first of the people who imported textiles from India and China, and then of the daring manufacturers 制造商 who were successful at copying the lightweight 轻便的, and colorful 色彩鲜艳的, and washable 可洗涤的 cotton clothing. +

But industrial production of cotton was really risky 冒险的 -- the rate of business failure 企业倒闭率 during the Industrial Revolution was over 50 percent. +

Because of that, experimenting manufacturers worked to keep labor costs 劳动力成本 as low as they could. +

One way was to use unpaid orphans 孤儿 from government, religious or charitable institutions 慈善机构 as labor 劳动力. +

At a time when people didn't know a lot about steam powered machinery 蒸汽动力机械 and its dangers, industrial accidents 工业事故 happened all the time, and children were often the victims 受害者. +

Children worked incredibly long hours 时间长得惊人 and deaths were common 常见. +

Little Mary Richards was caught up in 卷入 a machine and six- and seven-year-old orphans working alongside her witnessed the quote "bones of her arms, legs, thighs, etc successively 相继地 snap... her head appeared dashed to pieces... her blood thrown about like water from a twirled mop." +

Now I know that's very graphic 生动的, but I think it's important to understand the extent of industrial oppression 工业压迫, including the industrial oppression of children. +

Workers lost arms, eyes, breasts, and fingers or were otherwise disfigured 毁容. +

Production and profits came first to avoid financial ruin 破产. +

And industry had other repercussions 影响. +

It initially 最初 increased the demand for slaves 奴隶 even more. +

Slaves produced food for workers who had left farms for factories. +

Slaves also produced tropical crops 热带作物 such as sugar, and tobacco 烟草, and coffee that boosted the energy of many types of workers. +

And slaves provided the palm and other tropical oils to keep machinery running 运转 as well as the raw materials 原材料 for industry, especially cotton. +

It's important to understand that industry thrived 繁荣 due to 由于 slave labor 奴隶劳动 and inexpensive child labor 廉价童工, and also through the labor of women, who were paid less than men. +

Over time 随着时间推移, more and more people began working in industrialized settings 工业化环境, or in economic sectors 经济部门 that supported industry due in part to 部分由于 the development of the steam engine 蒸汽机. +

In 1776, English inventor James Watt launched 推出 a steam engine that improved earlier models. +

Now as far back as 早在 Roman Egypt and then Ottoman Egypt and China, people had known about steam engines, But Watt's engine was more efficient 高效的, which made it useful in replacing 取代 animal and water power, not just in mines 矿井 but also powering 为…提供动力 textile factories, and then other machinery 机械. +

For millennia 数千年, almost all human power came from our muscles 肌肉. +

Then we harnessed 利用 some animal power, and eventually some wind and water power. +

But steam power 蒸汽动力 completely revolutionized 彻底改变 how much work could be done on behalf of 代表 humans, and also of course changed transportation 交通 when it was attached to 连接到 covered and uncovered wagons 有篷和无篷马车 and ships to make trains and steamships 蒸汽轮船 and eventually automobiles 汽车. +

And the train created another kind of demand: as urbanization 城市化 soared 急剧上升 around railway hubs 铁路枢纽, small and grand train stations were built along with all the other buildings to house the railway's primary and secondary employees 初级和次级员工. +

By secondary employees I mean, it wasn't just station-masters 站长, ticket-sellers 售票员, and conductors 列车员, there was a need for shopkeepers 店主, and pharmacists 药剂师, and construction workers 建筑工人, and teachers, and doctors, and drivers of coaches 马车夫, not to mention 更不用说 sanitation workers 环卫工人, police, and urban administrators 城市管理人员. +

Industrialization 工业化 had a snowball effect 滚雪球效应 and it wasn't gonna be turned back 无法逆转. +

And all this meant that everyday life also transformed 转变. +

Two classes became prominent 突出的 alongside the aristocracy 贵族 and peasants 农民 in the social structure 社会结构: the bourgeoisie 资产阶级 and proletariat 无产阶级 or working class 工人阶级. +

The bourgeoisie initially 最初 referred to 指的是 people who lived in towns and cities or burgs/bourgs. +

But the term came to refer to those who owned factories, banks, transportation networks 交通网络, and large tracts of land 大片土地 for raising livestock 牲畜 and crops 农作物. +

The proletariat comprise 构成 the many factory and other workers who lacked tools or land to support themselves but instead rather labored for 为…劳动 factory owners and others who had the means to produce 生产资料. +

In between were the rising professional groups, called the middle class 中产阶级 in Europe: the doctors, lawyers, teachers, and others with special skills that serviced society as a whole 为整个社会服务. +

We will see this configuration 结构 change over the next two centuries and watch tensions 紧张局势 unfold 展现 among these groups, and at times boil over 爆发. +

Women also experienced a transformation 转变 of everyday life. +

In the preceding centuries 在前几个世纪, they had generally worked on farms or in workshops alongside their artisan husbands or on their own as hatmakers 制帽工, and seamstresses 女裁缝, and weavers 织布工, and spinners 纺纱工. +

During the early days of industrialization 工业化初期, women who had been spinning or weaving at home often switched to 转向 factories. +

And they did many other kinds of work; for example, eighteen-year-old Ann Eggly with her younger sister worked twelve-hour days 每天工作12小时 in the coal mines 煤矿 pushing carriages 推车 filled with 800 pounds of coal (which was then used to make steam power). +

She had done this kind of work since she was seven. +

I don't know if you know any seven year olds, but they should not be working in coal mines. +

Now you'll recall that the French and American revolutions, with their emphasis on 强调 motherhood 母性 and laws stripping women of their property 剥夺女性财产的法律, led to women being discouraged from work 不愿工作. +

But many continued to do so even when their wages belonged to their husbands. +

Factories also created (and still create) outwork 外包工作 done by women at home: polishing knives 磨刀 or painting porcelain buttons 绘制瓷纽扣 for example. +

But, ideology 意识形态 simultaneously 同时 shifted to say that women were to be "angels in the household" 家庭中的天使, providing comfort from the horrors of industrial life 工业生活的恐怖, a cultural norm 文化规范 that discouraged work outside the home. +

In the meantime 与此同时, the classes became aware of their individual identities 身份. +

The French had outlawed 取缔 guilds 行会 during the revolution. +

Industrial and other workers formed their own clubs to protect their interests 利益. +

They created singing, gymnastic 体操的, and sports clubs -- this is why early English football teams had names like Royal Engineers AFC and Civil Service FC. +

These groups often had a lively cafe culture 咖啡馆文化, where they discussed politics and read newspapers, often allowed to their comrades 同志 because each cafe usually only had one newspaper. +

Manufacturers and wealthy individuals in cities likewise 同样地 formed groups based on their common class position 阶级地位; they founded chambers of commerce 商会 to protect their financial interests 经济利益 and museums to show off 炫耀 their city's achievements and good taste 品味. +

Let's go to the Thought Bubble. +

Initially 最初, the rise of factories saw those left out of industrial work life 工业工作生活,
such as artisans and small farmers,
protest 抗议 by breaking machinery 破坏机器 or threatening to do so. +

The "Swing riots" 斯温暴动 in Britain are one example of what has been called "primitive" rebellion 原始反抗. +

Instead of dealing with change by organizing to benefit from and shape the change,
so-called primitive rebels 原始反抗者 went about breaking things. +

Wreckers of machinery 破坏机器的人 were called Luddites 卢德分子
(as they still are today)
because menacing notes 恐吓信 found alongside sabotage 破坏活动 were often signed Ned Ludd. +

Ludd was an inspirational figure 鼓舞人心的人物 -- a weaver who allegedly 据称 smashed 砸毁 a textile machine 纺织机 in the 18th century. +

But gradually 逐渐地, workers inside the factories formed mutual aid societies 互助协会
and eventually unions 工会 that negotiated for 谈判 better terms 条件 with owners. And when negotiations failed,
they went on strike 罢工 as a group instead of wrecking the machines with which they earned their living. +

All in all 总而言之, industrialization wreaked havoc on 对…造成严重破坏 people's lives even as it provided many with livelihoods 生计. +

Towns grew astronomically 飞速地: like textile center Manchester England went from 20,000 people in the 1750s to 400,000 a century later. +

Conditions in Manchester were abominable 恶劣的, including the development of slums 贫民窟, and the spread of disease 疾病传播. +

They came to lack fresh and safe supplies of water. +

Garbage and sewage 污水, not to mention animal excrement 粪便, filled muddy streets 泥泞的街道,
creating, in the words of one commentator 评论员, "a universal atmosphere of filth and stink." +

Conditions in other industrial cities hardly differed 几乎没有不同. +

Thanks Thought Bubble. +

So, Industrialization spread from England and the low countries 低地国家 where it began thanks to 由于 the capital 资本 raised by worldwide trade 全球贸易, and because that trade made possible successful imitation of 成功模仿 foreign products. +

But industrialization then spread. +

It traveled the continent 欧洲大陆 through the 19th century, although industrialization was less dense 密集的 in eastern Europe. +

There, many peasants continued to live hand There, many peasants continued to live hand-to-mouth 勉强糊口, but as we've seen, so did the poor in industrial cities. +

So was the Industrial Revolution a revolution? +

Well, if a revolution is an event full of impact 影响 on people's lives, it certainly was. +

But often historians look at revolutions as, like, ending, which the Industrial Revolution really hasn't. +

Unlike the comparatively 相对地 brief 短暂的 English Revolution or American Revolution, many see the Industrial Revolution as continuing to make dramatic 巨大的；引人注目的 changes in our way of life today. +

Today, we expect technologies to change dramatically in our lifetimes. +

We expect to use different tools to communicate and work than our parents used. +

But that expectation 期望 is only a couple hundred years old. +

It makes you wonder. +

If you closed your eyes in 2020, and woke up in 2120, how weird is the world gonna be. +

Ugh. +

Thinking about that is stressing me out 让我压力很大. +

Next time, we'll look further at the cultural and political aspects 方面 of industrialization. +

I'll see you then. +

Thanks for watching. +

大家好，我是约翰·格林，这里是《速成欧洲史》。 +

所以，我们现在要把注意力转向工业革命（Industrial Revolution），它是人类历史上最重要的发展之一。 +

来，和我一起想象一下，现在是1820年。 +

顺便说一下，这个想法是我从经济学家罗伯特·戈登（Robert Gordon）那里得来的。 +

假设你住在英国（England）。 +

你很可能从事农业工作。 +

当你步行去镇上时，要么拉着自己的手推车，要是运气好的话，你可能有一匹马。 +

你没有自来水，也没有电。 +

当你清洗仅有的几件衣服时，只能用手洗。 +

你在炉火上做饭。 +

你对时间的认知，主要不是以分钟和小时来衡量，而大多是与太阳的周期相关——离夜晚有多近，离早晨有多近，或者离隆冬有多近。 +

在所有这些方面，你在1820年的生活，基本上与1720年、1520年，甚至1220年人们的生活没什么两样。 +

这并不是说在这几百年里生活没有变化——正如我们在这个系列中探讨过的，很多方面都发生了变化——但正如格雷戈里·克拉克（Gregory Clark）所观察到的，就生活水平而言，1800年的欧洲人，基本上过着与尼安德特人（Neanderthals）相似的生活。 +

现在想象一下，你在1820年闭上眼睛，然后在1920年醒来。 +

到这时，英国的大多数人已不再从事农业工作。 +

他们可能在商店、交通、采矿、作坊或工厂工作。 +

他们用分钟来衡量时间。 +

汽车已经存在。 +

有些人有收音机（radios），它能通过空气传播信息。 +

少数人甚至有了冰箱（refrigerators），这极大地减少了食物变质和食源性疾病的风险。 +

偶尔，你甚至可能看到一架飞机在空中飞过。 +

哦，对了，而且你的国家刚刚从一场极其致命的战争中走出来，这场战争使用了像氯气（chlorine gas）这样极具杀伤力的武器，这些武器是1820年的人们根本无法想象的。 +

欢迎来到工业革命时代。 +

[开场介绍] +

在这个系列中，我们已经谈到了提高欧洲生产力的农业革命（revolutions in agriculture），以及贸易革命（revolutions in trade），贸易革命使得商品越来越多地在城镇和城市的人们之间分配，而不是每个家庭都生产自己所需的一切。 +

这些力量共同作用，促进了更多的劳动分工：比如，农民可以专注于农业生产，纺织工人可以专注于纺织，这比每个家庭从事各种工作的效率要高。 +

那么，让我们从18世纪开始讲起，据说欧洲的工业生产就是从那时开始的。 +

在经历了几个世纪的连绵不断的战争、瘟疫以及小冰期（little ice age）最糟糕的时期之后，欧洲的人口开始增长。 +

与此同时，像咖啡（coffee）、茶（tea）和巧克力（chocolate）这样用热水制作的产品可以杀死细菌，而来自国外的产品丰富并多样化了营养来源，例如，玉米（corn）和土豆（potatoes），通常每英亩的热量比小麦（wheat）更高。 +

简而言之，人们的寿命越来越长，人口也在增加。 +

这意味着平均而言，人们有了更多的时间去学习、捣鼓和实验。 +

许多不同的工匠对现有的机械设备进行了一些小的改进。 +

也许最著名的是，约翰·凯（John Kay）发明的飞梭（flying shuttle）提高了织布的速度和生产率。 +

这样一来，织布工就需要更多的线。 +

于是，一些爱捣鼓的人通过发明一些东西来满足这一需求，比如大约在1764年由工匠詹姆斯·哈格里夫斯（James Hargreaves）发明的珍妮纺纱机（spinning jenny）。 +

珍妮纺纱机是一种供个体女性在家使用的机器。 +

它让一个人仅用手的力量，就可以一次纺出多达120个线轴的线，而不是一个。 +

在英国，埃伦·哈金（Ellen Hacking）和她的丈夫约翰（John）是发明梳棉机（carding machines）的人之一，这种机器用于梳理棉花（cotton）和羊毛（wool）纤维以便纺纱。 +

大约在同一时间，理查德·阿克莱特（Richard Arkwright）和他的合伙人发明了水力纺纱机（water frame），这是另一种利用水力的纺纱机器。 +

当纺纱机可以连接到像水这样的中央动力源时，许多纺纱机就可以被放置在一个单一的建筑里。 +

所以，世界上第一批工厂（factories）的出现，部分是由于要为全球和国内市场增加英国布料（English cloth）产量的压力。 +

世界的中心刚刚打开了吗？ +

我的一件保罗（Polo）牌衬衫在里面吗？ +

这件衬衫花了大概41美元。 +

我每年两次会去印第安纳州南部（Southern Indiana）的一家保罗品牌折扣店，然后尽可能多地买下他们愿意卖给我的衬衫。 +

听着，我不是来给保罗牌衬衫做广告的，但这件衬衫穿起来超级舒服，而且，它染成了一种特别的颜色。 +

在19世纪早期，这一切都是完全无法想象的。 +

事实上，你知道吗？ +

它摸起来太柔软了，我想我要穿上它。 +

这很奇怪吗？ +

哦，太棒了！ +

我感觉自己就像80年代电影里的反派。 +

我看起来怎么样，斯坦（Stan）？ +

哦，斯坦说我看起来像史蒂夫·班农（Steve Bannon）。 +

好吧。 +

这个实验到此结束，现在回到节目中来。 +

让我们谈谈瓷器（porcelain）。 +

另一位爱捣鼓的人是炼金术士约翰·弗里德里希·伯特格尔（Johann Friedrich Böttger），他向萨克森（Saxony）国王承诺，他能弄清楚如何制作瓷器。 +

人们对瓷器是如此痴迷，以至于富人会收藏它，即使是那些远没有那么富有的人也会试着买一两件——比如一个杯子或一个盘子——就像我们在许多荷兰（Dutch）、法国（French）和其他国家的绘画中看到的那样。 +

在描绘富人或渴望成为富人的人的欧洲绘画中，有两样东西经常出现：瓷器和菠萝（pineapples），菠萝也非常稀有、昂贵，而且在国内很难种植。 +

瓷器也很实用，因为欧洲人不知道还有其他什么方法可以制作耐热的餐具来盛放他们的热饮。 +

所以，伯特格尔几乎就像被囚禁了一样，直到1708年左右，他终于弄清楚了如何制作瓷器，尽管制作出来的瓷器没有中国和日本的那么精美。 +

我们在这里想要说明的是，虽然人们喜欢听发明家及其发明的伟大故事，但工业革命是许多许多人共同努力的故事，他们进行了一系列渐进式的改进，而不是像那些高高在上的天才创造出令人惊叹的东西。 +

人类真正的天赋是合作，还有间谍活动。 +

例如，工业间谍（Industrial spies）对每一项发展都起到了推动作用，因为在制造业方面，其他地区远比欧洲先进，比如，不褪色的染料（color fast dyes）和耐热餐具（heat-resistant dishware）、精细的纺织和纺纱技术，甚至是冶金术（metallurgy）。 +

例如，阿克莱特大多是从进口的纺织品（textiles）上抄袭设计。 +

正是那些棉纺织品（cotton textiles）激发了消费者的想象力，并让人们赚得盆满钵满，起初是那些从印度（India）和中国（China）进口纺织品的人，然后是那些敢于尝试且成功复制出轻便、色彩鲜艳且可水洗的棉质服装（cotton clothing）的制造商。 +

但是棉花（cotton）的工业化生产风险很大——工业革命期间，企业的失败率超过了50%。 +

正因为如此，勇于尝试的制造商们努力将劳动力成本尽可能地降低。 +

一种方法是使用来自政府、宗教或慈善机构的无薪孤儿作为劳动力。 +

在那个人们对蒸汽动力机械（steam powered machinery）及其危险了解不多的时代，工业事故（industrial accidents）时有发生，而儿童往往是受害者。 +

孩子们的工作时间长得令人难以置信，死亡也很常见。 +

小玛丽·理查兹（Little Mary Richards）被卷入了一台机器中，和她一起工作的六七岁的孤儿们目睹了“她手臂、腿、大腿等部位的骨头相继折断……她的头看起来都碎了……她的血像从旋转的拖把上甩出来的水一样四处飞溅”。 +

我知道这描述得很形象，但我认为了解工业压迫的程度很重要，包括对儿童的工业压迫。 +

工人们失去了手臂、眼睛、乳房、手指，或者在其他方面毁容。 +

为了避免经济崩溃，生产和利润被放在首位。 +

工业还有其他影响。 +

它最初甚至进一步增加了对奴隶（slaves）的需求。 +

奴隶为那些离开农场进入工厂的工人生产食物。 +

奴隶还生产像糖（sugar）、烟草（tobacco）和咖啡（coffee）这样的热带作物，这些作物能提升许多不同类型工人的精力。 +

奴隶还提供棕榈油（palm oils）和其他热带油（tropical oils）来维持机器运转，以及工业生产所需的原材料，尤其是棉花。 +

重要的是要明白，工业的繁荣得益于奴隶劳动（slave labor）和廉价的童工劳动（inexpensive child labor），也得益于女性的劳动，而女性的工资比男性低。 +

随着时间的推移，越来越多的人开始在工业化的环境中工作，或者在支持工业的经济部门工作，这在一定程度上要归功于蒸汽机（steam engine）的发展。 +

1776年，英国发明家詹姆斯·瓦特（James Watt）推出了一种改进了早期型号的蒸汽机。 +

其实早在罗马统治时期的埃及（Roman Egypt），然后是奥斯曼帝国统治时期的埃及（Ottoman Egypt）以及中国，人们就已经知道蒸汽机了，但瓦特的蒸汽机效率更高，这使得它不仅在矿井中，而且在为纺织厂（textile factories）以及其他机械设备提供动力方面，都能有效地取代畜力和水力。 +

几千年来，几乎所有的人力都来自我们的肌肉力量。 +

然后我们利用了一些动物的力量，最终又利用了一些风力和水力。 +

但是蒸汽动力彻底改变了人类能够完成的工作量，当然，当它被安装在有篷和无篷的马车以及船只上，从而制造出火车（trains）、轮船（steamships），并最终制造出汽车（automobiles）时，也改变了交通运输方式。 +

而火车又产生了另一种需求：随着铁路枢纽（railway hubs）周围的城市化进程急剧加速，大大小小的火车站（train stations）与其他各种建筑一起拔地而起，为铁路的主要和次要员工提供住所。 +

我所说的次要员工，不仅仅是指站长、售票员和列车员，还需要店主、药剂师、建筑工人、教师、医生、马车夫，更不用说环卫工人、警察和城市管理人员了。 +

工业化产生了滚雪球效应，而且无法逆转。 +

所有这一切都意味着日常生活也发生了转变。 +

在社会结构中，除了贵族（aristocracy）和农民（peasants）之外，两个阶级变得突出起来：资产阶级（bourgeoisie）和无产阶级（proletariat）或工人阶级（working class）。 +

资产阶级最初指的是那些住在城镇或城市（burgs/bourgs）里的人。 +

但这个词后来用来指代那些拥有工厂、银行、交通网络，以及大片用于饲养牲畜和种植庄稼的土地的人。 +

无产阶级由许多工厂和其他行业的工人组成，他们没有工具或土地来维持生计，而是为工厂主和其他有生产资料的人劳动。 +

介于两者之间的是不断崛起的专业群体，在欧洲被称为中产阶级（middle class）：医生、律师、教师，以及其他拥有特殊技能、为整个社会服务的人。 +

在接下来的两个世纪里，我们将看到这种结构发生变化，目睹这些群体之间的紧张关系逐渐显现，有时甚至会激化。 +

女性的日常生活也经历了一场变革。 +

在之前的几个世纪里，她们通常在农场工作，或者在作坊里与作为工匠的丈夫一起工作，或者自己从事制帽、缝纫、织布和纺纱等工作。 +

在工业化的早期，那些曾经在家中纺纱或织布的女性，常常转而进入工厂工作。 +

她们还从事许多其他种类的工作；例如，18岁的安·埃格利（Ann Eggly）和她的妹妹在煤矿（coal mines）里每天工作12个小时，推着装满800磅煤的马车（这些煤随后被用来产生蒸汽动力）。 +

她从7岁起就开始做这种工作。 +

我不知道你是否认识7岁的孩子，但他们不应该在煤矿里工作。 +

你可能还记得，法国大革命（French revolution）和美国大革命（American revolution）强调母性，而且法律剥夺了女性的财产权，这导致女性不愿工作。 +

但许多女性仍然继续工作，即使她们的工资属于她们的丈夫。 +

工厂也创造了（而且现在仍然创造着）由女性在家完成的外包工作：比如打磨刀具或给瓷纽扣上色。 +

但是，与此同时，观念也发生了转变，认为女性应该成为“家庭中的天使”，为人们提供慰藉，使他们免受工业生活的恐怖，这种文化规范不鼓励女性外出工作。 +

与此同时，各个阶级开始意识到自己的身份。 +

法国大革命期间，行会（guilds）被取缔。 +

产业工人和其他工人组成了自己的俱乐部来保护他们的利益。 +

他们创建了歌唱俱乐部、体操俱乐部和体育俱乐部——这就是为什么早期的英国足球队有像皇家工程师足球俱乐部（Royal Engineers AFC）和公务员足球俱乐部（Civil Service FC）这样的名字。 +

这些团体通常有着活跃的咖啡馆文化，他们在那里讨论政治、阅读报纸，由于每个咖啡馆通常只有一份报纸，所以常常会和同伴们一起分享阅读。 +

城市里的制造商和富人也同样根据他们共同的阶级地位组成了团体；他们成立了商会（chambers of commerce）来保护他们的经济利益，还建立了博物馆（museums）来展示他们城市的成就和高雅品味。 +

让我们进入“思想泡泡”环节。 +

最初，工厂的兴起让那些被排除在工业工作生活之外的人，比如工匠和小农场主，通过破坏机器或威胁要破坏机器来进行抗议。 +

英国的“斯温暴动”（“Swing riots”）就是所谓的“原始”反抗的一个例子。 +

所谓的原始反抗者没有通过组织起来从变革中受益并塑造变革来应对变化，而是选择去破坏东西。 +

破坏机器的人被称为卢德分子（Luddites）（现在仍然如此），因为在破坏行为发生的现场发现的威胁性纸条上，常常署名为内德·卢德（Ned Ludd）。 +

卢德是一个鼓舞人心的人物——据说是18世纪的一个织布工，他曾砸碎了一台纺织机器。 +

但渐渐地，工厂里的工人组成了互助协会（mutual aid societies），最终成立了工会（unions），与工厂主谈判争取更好的条件。当谈判失败时，他们会集体罢工（go on strike），而不是去破坏他们赖以谋生的机器。 +

总而言之，工业化虽然为许多人提供了生计，但也严重扰乱了人们的生活。 +

城镇的规模急剧扩大：比如英国的纺织中心曼彻斯特（Manchester），在18世纪50年代人口为2万，一个世纪后就增长到了40万。 +

曼彻斯特的条件非常恶劣，包括贫民窟（slums）的出现和疾病的传播。 +

那里开始缺乏新鲜、安全的水源供应。 +

垃圾和污水，更不用说动物粪便了，填满了泥泞的街道，用一位评论员的话说，“营造出一种普遍的污秽和恶臭的氛围”。 +

其他工业城市的情况也好不到哪里去。 +

感谢“思想泡泡”！ +

所以，工业化从英国和低地国家（low countries）传播开来，这得益于全球贸易筹集的资金，也因为这种贸易使得成功模仿外国产品成为可能。 +

但工业化随后继续扩散。 +

在整个19世纪，它传播到了欧洲大陆，尽管东欧（eastern Europe）的工业化程度较低。 +

在那里，许多农民仍然过着勉强糊口的生活，但正如我们所看到的，工业城市里的穷人也是如此。 +

那么，工业革命算是一场革命吗？ +

嗯，如果一场革命是指对人们的生活产生重大影响的事件，那么它无疑是一场革命。 +

但历史学家通常认为革命是有终点的，而工业革命实际上并没有结束。 +

与相对短暂的英国革命（English Revolution）或美国革命（American Revolution）不同，许多人认为工业革命仍在继续，并且极大地改变着我们今天的生活方式。 +

如今，我们期望在自己的有生之年，技术能发生巨大的变化。 +

我们期望使用与父母不同的工具来进行交流和工作。 +

但这种期望仅仅只有几百年的历史。 +

这不禁让人思考。 +

如果你在2020年闭上眼睛，然后在2120年醒来，世界会变得多么奇怪啊。 +

呃。

想到这个就让我压力山大。 +

下次，我们将进一步探讨工业化的文化和政治方面。 +

到时候见。 +

感谢观看。 +

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

So we're going to turn our attention now to the Industrial Revolution, one of the most significant developments in human history.

Like, imagine with me that it's 1820.

I got this idea from the economist Robert Gordon, by the way.

You live in, say, England.

You probably work in agriculture.

When you walk to town, you're either pulling your own cart, or if you're lucky you have a horse.

You have no running water or electricity.

When you wash your few items of clothing, you do so by hand.

You cook over a fire.

You think of time not primarily in minutes and hours, but mostly in relationship to solar cycles -- how close it is to night, or to morning, or to midwinter.

And in all these respects, your life in 1820 is basically identical to the lives of people in 1720, or 1520, or for that matter 1220.

That's not to say life hasn't changed in those hundreds of years -- as we've explored in this series, lots has changed -- but as Gregory Clark observed, in terms of standard of living, Europeans in 1800 basically led lives similar to those of Neanderthals.

Now imagine that you close your eyes in 1820 and wake up in 1920.

By now, most people in England do not work in agriculture.

They may work in shops, or transportation, or mining, or workshops, or in factories.

They measure time in minutes.

Cars exist.

Some people have radios, which transmitted information through thin air.

A few people even have refrigerators, which dramatically decrease food spoilage and the risk of foodborne illness.

Occasionally you might even see an airplane flying in the sky.

Oh, and also, your country has just emerged from an astonishingly deadly war fought with highly lethal weapons such as chlorine gas, weapons that people of 1820 could not possibly have imagined.

Welcome to the Industrial Revolution.

[Intro]

In this series, we've already talked about revolutions in agriculture that increased European productivity and revolutions in trade that increasingly distributed goods among people in towns and cities instead of having each individual family produce everything it needed.

And these forces combined to help create more division of labor: like, farmers could focus on farming, and textile workers could focus on textile creation, which was more efficient than having each family do every kind of work.

So let's begin in the eighteenth century, when European industrial production is said to have begun.

Europe's population was growing after centuries of non-stop wars, plagues, and the worst of the little ice age.

Meanwhile, products such as coffee, tea, and chocolate made with heated water killed bacteria, while products from abroad expanded and varied the pool of nutrients, with corn and potatoes, for instance, generally more calorie-dense per acre than wheat.

In short, lives were getting longer and populations rising.

This meant that on average people had a little more time to learn, tinker, and experiment.

Many different artisans invented small improvements to existing mechanical devices.

Perhaps most famously, John Kay's flying shuttle increased the pace and productivity of weaving.

Weavers then needed a greater amount of thread.

So tinkerers made that happen by producing inventions such as the spinning jenny, created around 1764 by craftsman James Hargreaves.

The spinning jenny was a machine used by individual women working at home.

And it allowed a person, using just the power of their hand, to spin not one bobbin of thread, but up to 120 at once.

In England, Ellen Hacking and her husband John were among those devising carding machines to straighten cotton and wool fibers for spinning.

And at about the same time, Richard Arkwright and his partners invented the water frame, another kind of spinning machine that used water power.

And when spinning machines could be linked to a central power source such as water, many could be placed in a single building.

So, the world's first factories arose in part from the pressure to increase production of English cloth for global and domestic markets.

Did the center of the world just open?

Is one of my Polo shirts in there?

This cost like $41.

Twice a year I go to a Polo outlet in Southern Indiana and just buy as many of these things as they'll sell to me.

And look, I'm not here to advertise Polo shirts, but this thing is incredibly comfortable, and also, it's like dyed a specific color.

Everything about this was completely unimaginable in the early nineteenth century.

In fact, you know what?

It's so soft to the touch, I think I'm going to put it on.

Is that weird?

Oh yeah!

I feel like I'm the bad guy in an 80s movie.

How do I look, Stan?

Oh, Stan says I look like Steve Bannon.

OK.

Thus ends that experiment, now back to the show.

Let's talk about porcelain.

Another tinkerer was the alchemist Johann Friedrich Böttger who promised the king of Saxony that he could figure out how to make porcelain.

Porcelain was such an obsession that wealthy people collected it and even those with far less would try to buy a piece or two -- a cup or plate -- as we see in many Dutch, French, and other paintings.

Two things you see a lot in European paintings of the affluent or those who aspired to affluence: porcelain and pineapples, which were also quite rare and expensive and difficult to produce domestically.

Porcelain was also practical, because Europeans did not know other ways to make heat resistant dishware for their hot drinks.

So Böttger was virtually imprisoned until around 1708 when he figured out how to make porcelain, although not as beautifully as the Chinese or Japanese did.

What we're trying to get at here is that while people love a great story of an inventor and their invention, the Industrial Revolution was the story of lots and lots of people working together, making a series of incremental improvements, rather than, like, geniuses from on high creating amazing things.

The real genius of humans is collaboration, and also spying.

Like for instance, Industrial spies helped with every development because other regions were far more advanced than Europe in manufacturing, for instance, color fast dyes and heat-resistant dishware, fine weaving and spinning, or even metallurgy.

Arkwright, for example, mostly copied designs from imported textiles.

And it was those cotton textiles that caught the imagination of consumers and filled pockets, first of the people who imported textiles from India and China, and then of the daring manufacturers who were successful at copying the lightweight, and colorful, and washable cotton clothing.

But industrial production of cotton was really risky -- the rate of business failure during the Industrial Revolution was over 50 percent.

Because of that, experimenting manufacturers worked to keep labor costs as low as they could.

One way was to use unpaid orphans from government, religious or charitable institutions as labor.

At a time when people didn't know a lot about steam powered machinery and its dangers, industrial accidents happened all the time, and children were often the victims.

Children worked incredibly long hours and deaths were common.

Little Mary Richards was caught up in a machine and six- and seven-year-old orphans working alongside her witnessed the quote "bones of her arms, legs, thighs, etc successively snap... her head appeared dashed to pieces... her blood thrown about like water from a twirled mop."

Now I know that's very graphic, but I think it's important to understand the extent of industrial oppression, including the industrial oppression of children.

Workers lost arms, eyes, breasts, and fingers or were otherwise disfigured.

Production and profits came first to avoid financial ruin.

And industry had other repercussions.

It initially increased the demand for slaves even more.

Slaves produced food for workers who had left farms for factories.

Slaves also produced tropical crops such as sugar, and tobacco, and coffee that boosted the energy of many types of workers.

And slaves provided the palm and other tropical oils to keep machinery running as well as the raw materials for industry, especially cotton.

It's important to understand that industry thrived due to slave labor and inexpensive child labor, and also through the labor of women, who were paid less than men.

Over time, more and more people began working in industrialized settings, or in economic sectors that supported industry due in part to the development of the steam engine.

In 1776, English inventor James Watt launched a steam engine that improved earlier models.

Now as far back as Roman Egypt and then Ottoman Egypt and China, people had known about steam engines, But Watt's engine was more efficient, which made it useful in replacing animal and water power, not just in mines but also powering textile factories, and then other machinery.

For millennia, almost all human power came from our muscles.

Then we harnessed some animal power, and eventually some wind and water power.

But steam power completely revolutionized how much work could be done on behalf of humans, and also of course changed transportation when it was attached to covered and uncovered wagons and ships to make trains and steamships and eventually automobiles.

And the train created another kind of demand: as urbanization soared around railway hubs, small and grand train stations were built along with all the other buildings to house the railway's primary and secondary employees.

By secondary employees I mean, it wasn't just station-masters, ticket-sellers, and conductors, there was a need for shopkeepers, and pharmacists, and construction workers, and teachers, and doctors, and drivers of coaches, not to mention sanitation workers, police, and urban administrators.

Industrialization had a snowball effect and it wasn't gonna be turned back.

And all this meant that everyday life also transformed.

Two classes became prominent alongside the aristocracy and peasants in the social structure: the bourgeoisie and proletariat or working class.

The bourgeoisie initially referred to people who lived in towns and cities or burgs/bourgs.

But the term came to refer to those who owned factories, banks, transportation networks, and large tracts of land for raising livestock and crops.

The proletariat comprise the many factory and other workers who lacked tools or land to support themselves but instead rather labored for factory owners and others who had the means to produce.

In between were the rising professional groups, called the middle class in Europe: the doctors, lawyers, teachers, and others with special skills that serviced society as a whole.

We will see this configuration change over the next two centuries and watch tensions unfold among these groups, and at times boil over.

Women also experienced a transformation of everyday life.

In the preceding centuries, they had generally worked on farms or in workshops alongside their artisan husbands or on their own as hatmakers, and seamstresses, and weavers, and spinners.

During the early days of industrialization, women who had been spinning or weaving at home often switched to factories.

And they did many other kinds of work; for example, eighteen-year-old Ann Eggly with her younger sister worked twelve-hour days in the coal mines pushing carriages filled with 800 pounds of coal (which was then used to make steam power).

She had done this kind of work since she was seven.

I don't know if you know any seven year olds, but they should not be working in coal mines.

Now you'll recall that the French and American revolutions, with their emphasis on motherhood and laws stripping women of their property, led to women being discouraged from work.

But many continued to do so even when their wages belonged to their husbands.

Factories also created (and still create) outwork done by women at home: polishing knives or painting porcelain buttons for example.

But, ideology simultaneously shifted to say that women were to be "angels in the household," providing comfort from the horrors of industrial life, a cultural norm that discouraged work outside the home.

In the meantime, the classes became aware of their individual identities.

The French had outlawed guilds during the revolution.

Industrial and other workers formed their own clubs to protect their interests.

They created singing, gymnastic, and sports clubs -- this is why early English football teams had names like Royal Engineers AFC and Civil Service FC.

These groups often had a lively cafe culture, where they discussed politics and read newspapers, often allowed to their comrades because each cafe usually only had one newspaper.

Manufacturers and wealthy individuals in cities likewise formed groups based on their common class position; they founded chambers of commerce to protect their financial interests and museums to show off their city's achievements and good taste.

Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

Initially, the rise of factories saw those left out of industrial work life,
such as artisans and small farmers,
protest by breaking machinery or threatening to do so.
The "Swing riots" in Britain are one example of what has been called "primitive" rebellion.
Instead of dealing with change by organizing to benefit from and shape the change,
so-called primitive rebels went about breaking things.
Wreckers of machinery were called Luddites
(as they still are today)
because menacing notes found alongside sabotage were often signed Ned Ludd.
Ludd was an inspirational figure -- a weaver who allegedly smashed a textile machine in the 18th century.
But gradually, workers inside the factories formed mutual aid societies
and eventually unions that negotiated for better terms with owners. And when negotiations failed,
they went on strike as a group instead of wrecking the machines with which they earned their living.
All in all, industrialization wreaked havoc on people's lives even as it provided many with livelihoods.
Towns grew astronomically: like textile center Manchester England went from 20,000 people in the 1750s to 400,000 a century later.
Conditions in Manchester were abominable, including the development of slums, and the spread of disease.
They came to lack fresh and safe supplies of water.
Garbage and sewage, not to mention animal excrement, filled muddy streets,
creating, in the words of one commentator, "a universal atmosphere of filth and stink."
and Conditions in other industrial cities hardly differed.
Thanks Thought Bubble.

So, Industrialization spread from England and the low countries where it began thanks to the capital raised by worldwide trade, and because that trade made possible successful imitation of foreign products.

But industrialization then spread.

It traveled the continent through the 19th century, although industrialization was less dense in eastern Europe.

There, many peasants continued to live hand-to-mouth, but as we've seen, so did the poor in industrial cities.

So was the Industrial Revolution a revolution?

Well, if a revolution is an event full of impact on people's lives, it certainly was.

But often historians look at revolutions as, like, ending, which the Industrial Revolution really hasn't.

Unlike the comparatively brief English Revolution or American Revolution, many see the Industrial Revolution as continuing to make dramatic changes in our way of life today.

Today, we expect technologies to change dramatically in our lifetimes.

We expect to use different tools to communicate and work than our parents used.

But that expectation is only a couple hundred years old.

It makes you wonder.

If you closed your eyes in 2020, and woke up in 2120, how weird is the world gonna be.

Ugh.

Thinking about that is stressing me out.

Next time, we'll look further at the cultural and political aspects of industrialization.

I'll see you then.

Thanks for watching.
