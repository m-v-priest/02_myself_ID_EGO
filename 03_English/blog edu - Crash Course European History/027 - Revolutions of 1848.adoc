Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History. +

So, there are many candidates 候选者；备选事物 for most important year in European history -- 1492, when permanent 永久的 links between Afroeurasia 亚非欧大陆 and the Americas first formed; 1688, when the Glorious Revolution 光荣革命 gave Europe an example of constitutional governments 君主立宪制政府; 1789, when the French Revolution 法国大革命 directly challenged monarchy 君主制; 1992, when the European Union 欧盟 was founded. +

But you can sure make a case for 为…提出理由 1848, when revolutions 革命 swept across 席卷 Europe in the wake of 随着…而来；作为…的结果 the upheavals 动荡 and protest we saw in the last episode. +

People in cities were suffering from economic dislocation 经济混乱, many having come from farms where new machinery 机械 had made their labor 劳动力 unnecessary. And urban artisans 城市工匠 were also under threat 受到威胁 because industrialization 工业化 was automating 使自动化 some of their jobs. +

Systems of government that had functioned effectively 有效运转 for agrarian 农业的, subsistence economies 自给自足经济 were proving ineffective 无效的 for this brave new world 全新的世界. In short 简而言之, automation 自动化 was changing work and governments weren't functioning particularly well. The more things change... +

[Intro] +

By the end of 1848, France, the Austrian Empire 奥地利帝国, Denmark 丹麦, Hungary 匈牙利, the Italian States 意大利各邦, and even Poland 波兰 would be enmeshed in 陷入；卷入 the greatest wave of revolutions Europe has ever seen. +

Many Europeans were experiencing the "Hungry Forties" 饥饿的四十年代, caused once again by bad harvests 歉收 and especially in Ireland the potato blight 马铃薯晚疫病, a mold 霉菌 that devastated 摧毁 potato crops in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe. +

The problem was made worse by several aspects 方面 of what might be called economic modernity 经济现代化 -- that is, standardization 标准化, one-crop agriculture 单一作物农业, and more efficient 高效的 wholesaling of food 食品批发. +

In terms of standardization and one-crop agriculture, traditionally Peru 秘鲁 had at least 4-5,000 types of potatoes. So if one type contracted 感染 a specific blight, there were still several thousand other varieties 品种 that might be safe. +

But Europe, followed by the United States, was gradually turning toward farms that focused on a single crop 单一作物, and often a single strain 品种 of a crop, for efficiency 效率. Increasingly, imperialists 帝国主义者 forced this standardization and single crop farming on other parts of the world, raising the chances for disaster 灾难. +

Because of the single strain of potato, blight devastated entire crops. And this resulted in 导致 death from starvation 饥饿 and diseases that invaded 侵袭 the weakened bodies of at least a million Irish farmers and their families. +

Another million or more emigrated 移民, some to England and others to the United States and Canada (where in both cases, by the way, there were no laws creating a distinction between legal and illegal immigration 合法与非法移民. People simply moved in.). +

And as scarcity 短缺 deepened in 1846 and 1847, Britain's liberal Whig government 自由辉格党政府 stuck to 坚持 its belief in laissez-faire 自由放任主义, meaning that the government should let events play themselves out 顺其自然发展, and therefore offered the Irish no help at all. +

The system of usually English landlords 地主 requiring payment from Irish peasants 农民 to work farmland also worsened the crisis 危机 -- like, throughout the Irish famine 爱尔兰大饥荒, huge amounts of food were exported from Ireland to England. +

Even today, the population of Ireland has not recovered from the famine -- some eight million people lived on the island in 1840; today, around 6.6 million do. +

Meanwhile, on the continent 欧洲大陆, food riots 粮食暴动 became common and threats to merchants 商人, and storekeepers 店主, and bakers 面包师, and government officials 政府官员 became more menacing 威胁的 and direct 直接的. One warning read: "If the grain merchants do not cease to take away grains... we will go to your homes and cut your throats and those of the three bakers... and burn the whole place down." +

So, yeah, it was pretty tense 紧张的 -- as things tend to be when people are starving 挨饿. +

Also, amid all this deprivation 贫困 and death, anti-slavery 反奴隶制 and pro-freedom 支持自由的 ideas were circulating 传播. Between 1833-1838, Britain freed slaves 解放奴隶 across the empire 帝国, except in India. A system of slave-like indentured labor 类似奴隶的契约劳工 did spring up 涌现, but the rhetoric 言辞 in Europe at least, was one of emancipation 解放. +

In eastern Europe, Moldavia 摩尔达维亚 and Wallachia 瓦拉几亚 began freeing several hundred thousand enslaved Roma 被奴役的罗姆人 in 1843. Later, in 1848, France also re-emancipated slaves 在重新奴役后再次解放奴隶 after their re-enslavement under Napoleon. +

These events were accompanied by 伴随着 popular abolitionism 废奴主义运动, and uprisings 起义, and the development of a language of freedom 自由的话语体系, especially freedom from governmental and structural oppression 政府和体制压迫. +

And that's really important, because in some ways, its only when we have language for ideas that we're able to share them and talk about them. And so, developing a language around freedoms, and ideas about human rights 人权 allowed us to share those ideas. +

On the cultural front 在文化方面, women such as French novelist George Sand (which was a pseudonym 笔名) and the English Bronte sisters -- pictured behind me, looking translucent 半透明的 as always -- published best-selling novels 畅销小说 that addressed 探讨 the persecution of women 对女性的迫害. +

Sand dressed in men's clothes to get cheaper seats at the theater 剧院 and for a while led a scandal-ridden life 充满丑闻的生活. The Brontes did quite the opposite 恰恰相反, but they still shocked people with their portrayal 描绘 of women as mad or crazed in domestic confinement 家庭禁锢中发疯或癫狂. +

Across Europe, women reformers 女性改革者 actively addressed the disproportionate poverty of women 女性不成比例的贫困问题, which intensified 加剧 as price inflation 物价上涨 for food made it harder to feed families in the Hungry Forties. +

Many working women also became more politically active 政治上更加活跃, demonstrating 示威游行 in front of city halls 市政厅 because their meager salaries 微薄的工资 no longer sufficed to 足以 buy high-priced bread 高价面包. +

Hey, so quick question about the Bronte sisters painting behind me. Who is this spectral figure 幽灵般的人物 in the middle who has been erased from the painting? Is that their weird brother who was an opiate addict 鸦片成瘾者? What was his name? Bromwell? Stan says his name was Branwell. which might be even worse. +

Update! We just found out that Branwell Bronte painted that painting, and he painted himself in with his sisters, but then he painted himself out 把自己从画中抹去, which is so sad! Oh! The self-hatred! Now I feel really bad making fun of you, person who's been dead for 150 years. +

OK, let's move on. +

So, when we last visited Italy, there was no such thing as Italy. Its territory 领土 was parceled out 分割 among the Spanish Bourbons 西班牙波旁王朝 to the south, the Austrian Habsburgs 奥地利哈布斯堡王朝 to the north, and the papacy 教皇国 in the center, among several other stakeholders 利益相关者. +

But when audiences at the operas of composer Giuseppe Verdi 朱塞佩·威尔第 heard his rousing choruses 激动人心的合唱 celebrating freedom and triumph over adversity 战胜逆境, they rose to their feet cheering 起立欢呼, and made Verdi a symbol of a unified Italy 统一的意大利 free from foreign domination 摆脱外国统治. +

And in the fall of 1847, women in Messina Sicily 西西里岛墨西拿 did more than cheer; they tore down 拆除 royal insignia 王室徽章 and in January 1848 they took to the streets 走上街头, beginning a brief revolution that took place in many parts of the peninsula 半岛. +

These women supported Giuseppe Mazzini 朱塞佩·马志尼, who wanted national unification 国家统一 and a republican form of government 共和政体. Others favored a government headed by the pope 教皇领导的政府, and still others wanted a monarchy 君主制. +

In the end 最终, this disunity 不团结 allowed for the revolutions to be defeated as Austrians, French, and other military forces 军事力量 were sent in to stop it. In fact, disunity of revolutions leading to failure 革命因不团结而失败 will become something of a theme 主题. +

Let's go to the Thought Bubble. +

1. In February 1848, myriad interests 众多利益群体 came together to spark revolution 引发革命 in Paris and then in other French cities. +
2. Upper-class reformers 上层阶级改革者 objected to 反对 the cronyism 任人唯亲, limited voting rights 有限的投票权, and censorship 审查制度. +
3. But in contrast 相比之下, the prime minister 首相, historian François Guizot 弗朗索瓦·基佐, thought Louis-Philippe's government was just right 刚刚好. +
4. The crowds sent him and the king into exile 流放. +
5. Those crowds were backed by 得到…支持 the upper-class reformers, but they were fueled by 由…推动 discontented workers 不满的工人, the unemployed 失业者, and struggling artisans 苦苦挣扎的工匠
6. -- all affected by rising food prices as well as uncertain conditions of employment 就业状况不稳定. +
7. A socialist different from the ones we've already talked about, Louis Blanc 路易·勃朗, was attuned to 适应；理解 the needs of workers and the poor in Paris. +
8. He convinced the new provisional government 临时政府 to set up 设立 national workshops 国家工场 to create jobs for unemployed men 失业男性创造就业机会. +
9. Women successfully demanded that workshops be established for them too and unsuccessfully nominated 提名 George Sand -- "male by virtue of virility 凭借男子气概像男人, female by divine intuition 凭借神圣直觉像女人" -- as a representative to the National Assembly 国民议会." +
10. As spring progressed 随着春天的推进, a new national assembly 国民议会, composed of 由…组成 less than ten percent workers, +
11. shut down 关闭 the workshops and formed a new national police force 国家警察部队 composed of men from the countryside 由来自农村的人组成, +
12. who had little patience for 对…没什么耐心 city people and their city problems. +
13. In June, tens of thousands of workers rose up 起义 and fought the national police for several days, +
14. until the bodies were piled high 尸体堆积如山 and the workers defeated. +
15. Now a republic 共和国, France held elections based on universal male suffrage 男性普选权, +
16. which the nephew of Napoleon, Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte 路易 - 拿破仑·波拿巴, won handily 轻易获胜, +
17. due to 由于 the support of peasants in the countryside 农村农民的支持. +
18. Lest you think the rural-urban divide 城乡差距 is anything new. +

Thanks Thought Bubble. +

So, just as these revolutions started, a new socialist duo 二人组, German lawyer and journalist Karl Marx 卡尔·马克思 and Manchester textile mill owner 曼彻斯特纺织厂主 Friedrich Engels 弗里德里希·恩格斯, issued The Communist Manifesto 《共产党宣言》. +

Its famous opening -- "A spectre is haunting Europe -- the spectre of communism 一个幽灵,共产主义的幽灵,在欧洲游荡" used the word communism 共产主义 instead of socialism based on the idea that society would soon revert to 恢复到 a traditional "community" of like-minded people 志同道合的传统“共同体”. +

Marx and Engels believed that class struggle 阶级斗争 was going to erupt 爆发 and wash away 消除 upper-class oppression 上层阶级压迫, and that the proletariat 无产阶级 would seize the means of production 生产资料 -- that is, factories and land and everything else would be shared by everyone, rather than owned by the few. +

And for the moment 目前, that was pretty much it for "Marxist" socialism 马克思主义社会主义. But over the next half century, however, it would, of course, take a firmer theoretical shape 形成更坚实的理论形态 and infuse 注入 workers' programs for change across the globe 全球工人变革计划, and become tremendously influential 极具影响力. +

And while initially 最初, few people paid attention to 关注 the Marxist ideas of class struggle, but some kind of struggle was certainly happening: The revolutions erupting across central and eastern Europe featured 以…为特点 -- depending on who you were -- calls for the creation of constitutionally directed government structures 建立受宪法约束的政府架构, an end to serf-like oppression 结束类似农奴的压迫 and censorship 审查制度, restoration of aristocratic privileges 恢复贵族特权, and yes, even democracy 民主. +

In short 简而言之, people wanted more power 权力, and also greater rights 权利 and protection of those rights 权利保护. And of course, then as now, ideas were not limited by borders 不受国界限制. +

Like, news of the revolution in France sent Berlin's activists 活动家 into the streets, pushing for 推动 an array of changes 一系列变革 but mostly for the unification of the German states 德意志邦国的统一. +

King Frederick William IV 腓特烈·威廉四世, who was forced to witness the carnage 大屠杀 on Berlin's streets, summoned 召集 a congress 代表大会 to meet at Frankfurt 法兰克福 to plan for reform 改革 and unification 统一. +

The meeting was dominated by 由…主导 the princes of the several dozen individual states 几十个邦国的亲王, and it progressed slowly 进展缓慢 as the princes debated whether to include Austria in this unification project 统一计划 until the Prussian king 普鲁士国王, on being offered the crown of a constitutional monarchy 君主立宪制王冠 refused to accept "a crown from the gutter 从阴沟里捡来的王冠." +

So instead, he would get no crown at all, and the German states would remain disunited 四分五裂. +

Did the Center of the World just open? Is there a gutter crown 阴沟王冠 in there? I don't know if this gutter crown is for children, or if I just have an exceptionally large head 头特别大, but regardless 不管怎样, if there is one lesson from 19th century Europe, it's that royals should take a gutter crown and be grateful for it 王室成员应该接受阴沟王冠并心存感激. +

You know what's fun? Being the Queen of England, or of the Netherlands 荷兰. You know what's not fun? Being the king of Germany. Because there is no king. +

OK. Let's turn our attention to Poland 波兰. +

So, already in 1846, Polish nationalists 波兰民族主义者 from the upper-classes 上层阶级 in the Galician city of Cracow 加利西亚的克拉科夫, hoped to lead a revolt 起义 against Austrian rule 奥地利统治. but, peasants in the region refused to join them because Austrian rule was the peasants' only hope for gaining freedom from the payments and service that they owed aristocratic landowners 贵族地主. +

What's that? Stan says I have to take off the gutter crown. +

So, we like to think of revolutions as being neatly for freedoms or against them, but here we have an example of it being much more complicated 复杂得多. Because if you're in like, the upper classes in Poland, or a working person in a city, freedom might look like freedom from Austrian oppression 摆脱奥地利压迫. But if your a peasant, freedom looks like freedom from feudalism 封建主义. +

So during that revolution, peasants rose up and slaughtered 屠杀 several thousand from the land-holding Polish nobility 拥有土地的波兰贵族. You can see how Marx came to believe class struggle was inevitable 不可避免的. +

The same fragmentation 分裂 appeared in March 1848 when an uprising 起义 broke out 爆发 in cities across the Austrian empire 奥地利帝国. Remember Prince Metternich 梅特涅亲王, architect 设计师；缔造者 of conservative reforms 保守改革 in Central Europe? By 1848 he was so unpopular that disliking him managed to unite the disparate interests 不同利益 of various classes and ethnic identities 民族身份 in the empire. +

Middle-class reformers 中产阶级改革者 wanted constitutional rule 立宪统治; aristocrats 贵族 wanted more power than they had with Metternich's imperial bureaucracy 帝国官僚机构 running things, workers wanted both political and economic reforms 政治和经济改革, and peasants, of course, wanted an end to the last oppressive vestiges of feudalism 封建主义最后的压迫残余. +

And in the face of 面对 temporary enthusiasm 一时的热情 on all sides, Metternich fled the country in disguise 乔装逃离该国. Later Emperor Ferdinand 斐迪南皇帝 stepped down 退位 in favor of 支持 his nephew 侄子, Francis Joseph 弗朗茨·约瑟夫, whose nephew Francis -- or Franz -- Ferdinand 弗朗茨·斐迪南 would go on to be a rather famous assasination victim 著名的暗杀受害者. +

Good God was there a rich person in central Europe not named Frederick or Francis or William or Louis or William-Louis or Frederick-William-Louis or Francis-Frederick-William-Louis? +

At any rate 无论如何, with the common enemy of Metternich gone, the common purpose 共同目标 soon disappeared as well. Peasants across the empire were, as they had been in 1846, not terribly interested in the push for noble and middle - class rights. They retreated from the fight once the imperial government abolished all traditional dues and obligations to the nobility. +

And as for the liberals and aristocrats -- in Austria and across most of Europe -- they weren't thrilled with the idea of giving workers the right to vote. They believed that workers did not have a big picture perspective 大局观 and instead were concerned with food, shelter, and taxes. +

As one privileged Austrian deputy 议员 put it: "we should prevent only those individuals from voting who live from a daily wage or who enjoy contributions from a charitable institution 慈善机构 -- in short, those who are not independent." And many singled out 挑出；挑选 Jewish people as being especially unworthy of rights 不配享有权利. +

And just as the revolutions of 1848 paved the way for 为…铺平道路 both reforms and conflicts in the 20th century, this exclusion of Jewish people from political participation 政治参与 and legal protection of rights 法律权利保护 was a harbinger 预兆 of what was to come. Much of that anti - Semitism 反犹主义 was focused in Eastern and Central Europe, but really it was everywhere. +

Ultimately 最终, in Austria, as elsewhere, once the rebels 反叛者 were disunited 分裂, they were easier to defeat, and they were crushed 镇压 in Vienna 维也纳, Prague 布拉格 and other cities, and then in 1849, Tsar Nicholas I 沙皇尼古拉一世 sent 300,000 troops 军队 to finish off 彻底消灭 the Hungarians for his Austrian ally 盟友. +

Around a hundred thousand people were killed across the Austrian empire in the revolutions of 1848 and thousands were killed elsewhere, not to mention 更不用说 the destruction of property 财产破坏 that accompanied what were often massacres 大屠杀. +

Guarantees of rights 权利保障 were also rolled back 撤销 and some participants were executed 处决, or imprisoned 监禁, or sent into exile 流放. And it's normal to wonder whether history is only the story of death and destruction 死亡与毁灭 and whether the outcomes 结果 were worth it. +

But consider the Austrian peasants who demanded and ultimately received an end to centuries of serfdom 农奴制. Imagine knowing that you and your children and your children's children will be forced to live on and work the same land, owing an endless debt to the same aristocratic family that you'll never be able to repay. +

Now imagine the end of that cycle 循环. Imagine being part of the first generation of people in living memory 记忆所及 who could leave. Was the revolution worth it? Perhaps for those families, it was. +

Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time. +

大家好，我是约翰·格林，这里是《速成欧洲史》。 +

在欧洲历史上，有很多年份都可被视作最重要的年份候选——1492年，当时非洲、欧洲、亚洲与美洲之间首次建立起了永久性的联系；1688年，光荣革命（Glorious Revolution）为欧洲提供了一个君主立宪制政府的范例；1789年，法国大革命（French Revolution）直接对君主制发起了挑战；1992年，欧盟（European Union）成立。 +

但你完全可以认为1848年是最重要的一年，在上一集我们看到的动荡和抗议之后，革命的浪潮席卷了整个欧洲。 +

城市里的人们正遭受着经济混乱的困扰，许多人来自农场，在那里新的机器使得他们的劳动力变得不再必要。城市里的工匠们也受到了威胁，因为工业化使他们的一些工作实现了自动化。 +

事实证明，那些在农业自给自足经济中有效运行的政府体系，在这个崭新的世界里已经不起作用了。简而言之，自动化正在改变工作模式，而政府的运作也不是特别良好。变化越大…… +

[开场介绍] +

到1848年底，法国（France）、奥地利帝国（Austrian Empire）、丹麦（Denmark）、匈牙利（Hungary）、意大利各邦（Italian States），甚至波兰（Poland），都将陷入欧洲有史以来最大的革命浪潮之中。 +

许多欧洲人正经历着 “饥饿的四十年代”（“Hungry Forties”），这又是由收成不好导致的，尤其是在爱尔兰（Ireland），马铃薯晚疫病（potato blight）肆虐，这种霉菌摧毁了爱尔兰和欧洲其他地方的马铃薯作物。 +

所谓的经济现代化的几个方面使这个问题变得更加严重——也就是标准化、单一作物种植，以及更高效的食品批发。 +

就标准化和单一作物种植而言，传统上秘鲁（Peru）至少有4000到5000种马铃薯。所以如果一种马铃薯感染了某种特定的疫病，仍然还有几千种其他品种可能是安全的。 +

但欧洲，随后是美国（United States），为了提高效率，正逐渐转向专注于种植单一作物的农场，而且常常是单一品种的作物。帝国主义者越来越多地将这种标准化和单一作物种植强加给世界其他地区，增加了灾难发生的可能性。 +

由于种植的是单一品种的马铃薯，疫病摧毁了整片作物。这导致至少一百万爱尔兰农民及其家人因饥饿而死，以及因身体虚弱而染上疾病致死。 +

另有一百多万人移民，一些人去了英国（Britain），另一些人去了美国和加拿大（Canada）（顺便说一下，在这两个国家，当时都没有法律区分合法和非法移民。人们只是直接迁入。）。 +

随着1846年和1847年物资短缺加剧，英国自由派辉格党（Whig）政府坚持其自由放任（laissez-faire）的理念，这意味着政府应该让事情顺其自然地发展，因此没有给爱尔兰人提供任何帮助。 +

通常由英国地主要求爱尔兰农民支付租金才能在农田劳作的制度也加剧了这场危机——比如，在整个爱尔兰大饥荒（Irish famine）期间，大量的食物从爱尔兰出口到了英国。 +

即使在今天，爱尔兰的人口也还没有从那场饥荒中恢复过来——1840年，岛上大约有800万人；如今，大约有660万人。 +

与此同时，在欧洲大陆，粮食骚乱变得很普遍，对商人、店主、面包师和政府官员的威胁变得更加危险和直接。有一则警告写道：“如果粮食商人不停止把粮食运走……我们就会到你们家里去，割断你们和那三个面包师的喉咙……然后把整个地方烧掉。” +

所以，是的，局势非常紧张——当人们挨饿的时候，情况往往就是这样。 +

此外，在所有这些贫困和死亡之中，反对奴隶制（anti-slavery）和支持自由（pro-freedom）的思想正在传播。在1833年至1838年间，除了在印度（India），英国解放了其帝国范围内的奴隶（slaves）。一种类似奴隶制的契约劳工（indentured labor）制度确实出现了，但至少在欧洲的言论中，宣扬的是解放（emancipation）。 +

在东欧（eastern Europe），摩尔达维亚（Moldavia）和瓦拉几亚（Wallachia）在1843年开始解放几十万被奴役的罗姆人（enslaved Roma）。后来，在1848年，法国（France）在拿破仑统治下重新奴役奴隶之后，又再次解放了奴隶。 +

这些事件伴随着民众的废奴主义运动（popular abolitionism）、起义，以及关于自由的话语的发展，尤其是摆脱政府和结构性压迫的自由。 +

这真的很重要，因为在某种程度上，只有当我们有了表达思想的语言时，我们才能够分享和讨论这些思想。所以，围绕自由发展出一种语言，以及关于人权（human rights）的思想，使我们能够分享这些观念。 +

在文化方面，像法国小说家乔治·桑（George Sand，这是一个笔名）和英国的勃朗特姐妹（Bronte sisters）——就像我身后照片里的那样，总是看起来若隐若现——出版了畅销小说，讲述了女性所遭受的迫害。 +

乔治·桑穿着男装去剧院买更便宜的座位，有一段时间还过着充满丑闻的生活。勃朗特姐妹则完全相反，但她们对女性在家庭禁锢中变得疯狂或痴狂的描写，仍然震惊了世人。 +

在整个欧洲，女性改革者积极关注女性不成比例地遭受贫困的问题，在 “饥饿的四十年代”，食品价格上涨使得养家糊口变得更加困难，这一问题愈发严重。 +

许多职业女性在政治上也变得更加活跃，她们在市政厅前示威，因为她们微薄的工资再也买不起高价的面包了。 +

嘿，关于我身后这幅勃朗特姐妹的画，有个小问题。中间这个被从画中抹去的幽灵般的人物是谁？是她们那个吸食鸦片成瘾的古怪哥哥吗？他叫什么名字来着？布罗姆韦尔（Bromwell）？斯坦说他叫布兰韦尔（Branwell）。这名字可能更糟。 +

最新消息！我们刚刚发现这幅画是布兰韦尔·勃朗特（Branwell Bronte）画的，他把自己和姐妹们画在了一起，但后来又把自己涂掉了，这太让人难过了！哦！这是多么的自我厌恶啊！现在我觉得拿一个已经去世150年的人开玩笑真的很不好。 +

好的，我们继续。 +

所以，上次我们谈到意大利（Italy）的时候，还没有意大利这个国家。它的领土被分割成几部分，南部归西班牙波旁王朝（Spanish Bourbons），北部归奥地利哈布斯堡王朝（Austrian Habsburgs），中部则归教皇（papacy），还有其他几个利益相关者。 +

但是当观众们在作曲家朱塞佩·威尔第（Giuseppe Verdi）的歌剧中听到他那激昂的合唱，歌颂自由以及战胜逆境时，他们都站起身来欢呼，这使威尔第成为了一个摆脱外国统治、统一的意大利的象征。 +

在1847年秋天，西西里岛（Sicily）墨西拿（Messina）的女性们可不仅仅是欢呼；她们扯下了王室徽章，在1848年1月，她们走上街头，在半岛的许多地方掀起了一场短暂的革命。 +

这些女性支持朱塞佩·马志尼（Giuseppe Mazzini），他希望实现国家统一，并建立一个共和制政府（republican form of government）。其他人则支持由教皇领导的政府，还有一些人希望建立一个君主制政府。 +

最终，这种不团结使得这些革命被镇压，因为奥地利、法国和其他国家的军队被派来平息革命。事实上，革命的不团结导致失败将成为一个反复出现的主题。 +

让我们进入“思想泡泡”环节。 +

1. 1848年2月，众多利益群体联合起来，在巴黎（Paris）引发了革命，随后革命蔓延到法国的其他城市。 +
2. 上层阶级的改革者反对任人唯亲、有限的投票权（voting rights）和审查制度（censorship）。 +
3. 但相比之下，首相、历史学家弗朗索瓦·基佐（François Guizot）认为路易-菲利普（Louis-Philippe）的政府恰到好处。 +
4. 人群把他和国王都赶去了流亡。 +
5. 这些人群得到了上层阶级改革者的支持，但不满的工人、失业者和苦苦挣扎的工匠们更是推动了革命， +
6. 他们都受到了食品价格上涨以及就业形势不稳定的影响。 +
7. 路易·勃朗（Louis Blanc）是一位与我们之前谈到的社会主义者不同的社会主义者，他关注巴黎工人和穷人的需求。 +
8. 他说服新成立的临时政府（provisional government）建立国家工场（national workshops），为失业男性创造就业机会。 +
9. 女性成功地要求也为她们建立工场，但提名乔治·桑——“凭借男子气概具有男性特质，凭借神圣直觉具有女性特质”——为国民议会（National Assembly）代表的提议却没有成功。 +
10. 随着春天的推进，一个新的国民议会成立了，其中工人占比不到10%， +
11. 关闭了这些工场，并组建了一支由来自农村的男性组成的新的国家警察部队（national police force）， +
12. 这些人对城市居民及其城市问题没什么耐心。 +
13. 6月，成千上万的工人起义，与国家警察战斗了好几天， +
14. 直到尸体堆积如山，工人被击败。 +
15. 此时已成为共和国（republic）的法国举行了基于普遍男性选举权（universal male suffrage）的选举， +
16. 拿破仑的侄子路易-拿破仑·波拿巴（Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte）轻松获胜， +
17. 这得益于农村农民的支持。 +
18. 可别以为城乡差距是什么新鲜事。 +

感谢“思想泡泡”！ +

所以，就在这些革命爆发的时候，一对新的社会主义搭档，德国律师兼记者卡尔·马克思（Karl Marx）和曼彻斯特（Manchester）纺织厂主弗里德里希·恩格斯（Friedrich Engels），发表了《共产党宣言》（The Communist Manifesto）。 +

其著名的开篇——“一个幽灵，共产主义的幽灵，在欧洲游荡”，使用了“共产主义”（communism）这个词，而不是“社会主义”（socialism），基于的理念是社会很快将回归到由志同道合的人组成的传统“共同体”（community）。 +

马克思和恩格斯认为，阶级斗争（class struggle）将会爆发，并洗刷掉上层阶级的压迫，无产阶级（proletariat）将夺取生产资料（means of production）——也就是说，工厂、土地和其他一切都将由所有人共享，而不是被少数人占有。 +

目前，“马克思主义”（Marxist）社会主义大致就是这样。但在接下来的半个世纪里，当然，它会形成更坚实的理论形态，并融入全球各地工人的变革计划中，产生巨大的影响力。 +

虽然起初很少有人关注马克思关于阶级斗争的思想，但某种斗争确实正在发生：在中欧和东欧（central and eastern Europe）爆发的革命，根据不同人的诉求，包括呼吁建立由宪法指导的政府结构，结束类似农奴制的压迫和审查制度，恢复贵族特权，甚至还有民主（democracy）。 +

简而言之，人们想要更多的权力，以及更大的权利，并希望这些权利得到保护。当然，当时和现在一样，思想是不受国界限制的。 +

比如，法国革命的消息让柏林（Berlin）的活动家们走上街头，推动一系列变革，但主要是推动德意志各邦（German states）的统一。 +

被迫目睹柏林街头大屠杀的国王腓特烈·威廉四世（King Frederick William IV），召集了一次在法兰克福（Frankfurt）举行的会议，来规划改革和统一事宜。 +

这次会议由几十个独立邦国的亲王们主导，会议进展缓慢，因为亲王们在争论是否要把奥地利（Austria）纳入这个统一计划，直到普鲁士国王（Prussian king）在被授予君主立宪制（constitutional monarchy）的王冠时，拒绝接受 “从阴沟里捡来的王冠”。 +

所以，结果是他根本得不到王冠，德意志各邦也将继续处于分裂状态。 +

世界的中心刚刚打开了吗？里面有阴沟王冠吗？我不知道这个阴沟王冠是不是为孩子们准备的，或者只是我的头特别大，但不管怎样，如果从19世纪的欧洲能学到一个教训的话，那就是王室成员应该接受一个阴沟王冠，并对此心存感激。 +

你知道什么有趣吗？当英国女王或者荷兰女王。你知道什么没那么有趣吗？当德国国王。因为根本就没有德国国王。 +

好的。让我们把注意力转向波兰。 +

所以，早在1846年，来自加利西亚（Galician）城市克拉科夫（Cracow）的波兰上层阶级民族主义者（Polish nationalists），希望领导一场反对奥地利统治（Austrian rule）的起义。但是，该地区的农民拒绝加入他们，因为奥地利的统治是农民摆脱对贵族地主的赋税和劳役的唯一希望。 +

什么？斯坦说我得把阴沟王冠摘下来。 +

所以，我们常常认为革命是纯粹为了自由或者纯粹反对自由，但这里我们看到的例子要复杂得多。因为如果你是波兰的上层阶级，或者是城市里的一个劳动者，自由可能意味着摆脱奥地利的压迫。但如果你是一个农民，自由则意味着摆脱封建主义（feudalism）。 +

所以在那场革命中，农民起义并屠杀了几千名拥有土地的波兰贵族（land-holding Polish nobility）。你可以理解马克思为什么会认为阶级斗争是不可避免的了。 +

同样的分裂也出现在1848年3月，当时奥地利帝国（Austrian empire）的各个城市爆发了起义。还记得梅特涅亲王（Prince Metternich）吗，中欧保守改革的策划者？到1848年，他已经非常不得人心，以至于对他的厌恶竟然使帝国内不同阶级和不同民族身份的各种利益群体联合了起来。 +

中产阶级改革者希望实行立宪统治（constitutional rule）；贵族们希望在梅特涅的帝国官僚机构管理事务时，能拥有比现在更多的权力；工人们既想要政治改革，也想要经济改革；而农民们，当然，希望结束封建主义最后的压迫残余。 +

面对各方暂时的热情，梅特涅乔装逃离了这个国家。后来，斐迪南皇帝（Emperor Ferdinand）退位，让位于他的侄子弗朗茨·约瑟夫（Francis Joseph），弗朗茨·约瑟夫的侄子弗朗茨（Franz）·斐迪南（Ferdinand）后来将成为一个相当著名的遇刺身亡者。 +

天哪，中欧难道就没有一个不叫腓特烈（Frederick）、弗朗茨（Francis）、威廉（William）、路易（Louis）、威廉-路易（William-Louis）、腓特烈-威廉-路易（Frederick-William-Louis）或者弗朗茨-腓特烈-威廉-路易（Francis-Frederick-William-Louis）的富人吗？ +

无论如何，随着共同的敌人梅特涅的离去，共同的目标也很快消失了。和1846年一样，帝国各地的农民对争取贵族和中产阶级的权利并不是特别感兴趣。一旦帝国政府废除了对贵族的所有传统赋税和义务，他们就退出了斗争。 +

至于自由主义者（liberals）和贵族们——在奥地利以及欧洲大部分地区——他们并不热衷于给予工人投票权（right to vote）。他们认为工人没有大局观，相反，他们关心的是食物、住所和税收。 +

正如一位奥地利的特权议员所说：“我们应该阻止那些靠日薪生活或者靠慈善机构资助生活的人投票——简而言之，就是那些不独立的人。” 而且许多人特别指出，犹太人（Jewish people）尤其不配享有权利。 +

正如1848年的革命为20世纪的改革和冲突铺平了道路一样，将犹太人排除在政治参与和权利的法律保护之外，是即将发生之事的预兆。大部分反犹主义（anti-Semitism）集中在东欧和中欧，但实际上它无处不在。 +

最终，在奥地利和其他地方一样，一旦叛乱者变得不团结，他们就更容易被击败，他们在维也纳（Vienna）、布拉格（Prague）和其他城市被镇压，然后在1849年，沙皇尼古拉一世（Tsar Nicholas I）派遣30万军队为他的奥地利盟友消灭了匈牙利人（Hungarians）。 +

在1848年的革命中，奥地利帝国各地大约有10万人丧生，其他地方也有数千人死亡，更不用说伴随着大规模屠杀而来的财产破坏了。 +

权利保障也被收回，一些参与者被处决、监禁或流放。人们很自然会想，历史是否仅仅是关于死亡和破坏的故事，以及这些结果是否值得。 +

但想想那些要求并最终结束了几个世纪农奴制（serfdom）的奥地利农民吧。想象一下，你知道你和你的孩子，以及你孩子的孩子，都将被迫生活在同一块土地上并在那里劳作，永远欠着同一个贵族家庭一笔你永远无法偿还的债务。 +

现在想象一下这个循环的终结。想象一下成为人们记忆中第一代能够离开的人。这场革命值得吗？也许对那些家庭来说，它是值得的。 +

感谢观看。我们下次再见。 +

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History. +

So, there are many candidates for most important year in European history -- 1492, when permanent links between Afroeurasia and the Americas first formed; 1688, when the Glorious Revolution gave Europe an example of constitutional governments; 1789, when the French Revolution directly challenged monarchy; 1992, when the European Union was founded. +

But you can sure make a case for 1848, when revolutions swept across Europe in the wake of the upheavals and protest we saw in the last episode. +

People in cities were suffering from economic dislocation, many having come from farms where new machinery had made their labor unnecessary. And urban artisans were also under threat because industrialization was automating some of their jobs. +

Systems of government that had functioned effectively for agrarian, subsistence economies were proving ineffective for this brave new world. In short, automation was changing work and governments weren't functioning particularly well. The more things change... +

[Intro] +

By the end of 1848, France, the Austrian Empire, Denmark, Hungary, the Italian States, and even Poland would be enmeshed in the greatest wave of revolutions Europe has ever seen. +

Many Europeans were experiencing the "Hungry Forties," caused once again by bad harvests and especially in Ireland the potato blight, a mold that devastated potato crops in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe. +

The problem was made worse by several aspects of what might be called economic modernity -- that is, standardization, one-crop agriculture, and more efficient wholesaling of food. +

In terms of standardization and one-crop agriculture, traditionally Peru had at least 4-5,000 types of potatoes. So if one type contracted a specific blight, there were still several thousand other varieties that might be safe. +

But Europe, followed by the United States, was gradually turning toward farms that focused on a single crop, and often a single strain of a crop, for efficiency. Increasingly, imperialists forced this standardization and single crop farming on other parts of the world, raising the chances for disaster. +

Because of the single strain of potato, blight devastated entire crops. And this resulted in death from starvation and diseases that invaded the weakened bodies of at least a million Irish farmers and their families. +

Another million or more emigrated, some to England and others to the United States and Canada (where in both cases, by the way, there were no laws creating a distinction between legal and illegal immigration. People simply moved in.). +

And as scarcity deepened in 1846 and 1847, Britain's liberal Whig government stuck to its belief in laissez-faire, meaning that the government should let events play themselves out, and therefore offered the Irish no help at all. +

The system of usually English landlords requiring payment from Irish peasants to work farmland also worsened the crisis -- like, throughout the Irish famine, huge amounts of food were exported from Ireland to England. +

Even today, the population of Ireland has not recovered from the famine -- some eight million people lived on the island in 1840; today, around 6.6 million do. +

Meanwhile, on the continent, food riots became common and threats to merchants, and storekeepers, and bakers, and government officials became more menacing and direct. One warning read: "If the grain merchants do not cease to take away grains... we will go to your homes and cut your throats and those of the three bakers... and burn the whole place down." +

So, yeah, it was pretty tense -- as things tend to be when people are starving. +

Also, amid all this deprivation and death, anti-slavery and pro-freedom ideas were circulating. Between 1833-1838, Britain freed slaves across the empire, except in India. A system of slave-like indentured labor did spring up, but the rhetoric in Europe at least, was one of emancipation. +

In eastern Europe, Moldavia and Wallachia began freeing several hundred thousand enslaved Roma in 1843. Later, in 1848, France also re-emancipated slaves after their re-enslavement under Napoleon. +

These events were accompanied by popular abolitionism, and uprisings, and the development of a language of freedom, especially freedom from governmental and structural oppression. +

And that's really important, because in some ways, its only when we have language for ideas that we're able to share them and talk about them. And so, developing a language around freedoms, and ideas about human rights allowed us to share those ideas. +

On the cultural front, women such as French novelist George Sand (which was a pseudonym) and the English Bronte sisters -- pictured behind me, looking translucent as always -- published best-selling novels that addressed the persecution of women. +

Sand dressed in men's clothes to get cheaper seats at the theater and for a while led a scandal-ridden life. The Brontes did quite the opposite, but they still shocked people with their portrayal of women as mad or crazed in domestic confinement. +

Across Europe, women reformers actively addressed the disproportionate poverty of women, which intensified as price inflation for food made it harder to feed families in the Hungry Forties. +

Many working women also became more politically active, demonstrating in front of city halls because their meager salaries no longer sufficed to buy high-priced bread. +

Hey, so quick question about the Bronte sisters painting behind me. Who is this spectral figure in the middle who has been erased from the painting? Is that their weird brother who was an opiate addict? What was his name? Bromwell? Stan says his name was Branwell. which might be even worse. +

Update! We just found out that Branwell Bronte painted that painting, and he painted himself in with his sisters, but then he painted himself out, which is so sad! Oh! The self-hatred! Now I feel really bad making fun of you, person who's been dead for 150 years. +

OK, let's move on. +

So, when we last visited Italy, there was no such thing as Italy. Its territory was parceled out among the Spanish Bourbons to the south, the Austrian Habsburgs to the north, and the papacy in the center, among several other stakeholders. +

But when audiences at the operas of composer Giuseppe Verdi heard his rousing choruses celebrating freedom and triumph over adversity, they rose to their feet cheering, and made Verdi a symbol of a unified Italy free from foreign domination. +

And in the fall of 1847, women in Messina Sicily did more than cheer; they tore down royal insignia and in January 1848 they took to the streets, beginning a brief revolution that took place in many parts of the peninsula. +

These women supported Giuseppe Mazzini, who wanted national unification and a republican form of government. Others favored a government headed by the pope, and still others wanted a monarchy. +

In the end, this disunity allowed for the revolutions to be defeated as Austrians, French, and other military forces were sent in to stop it. In fact, disunity of revolutions leading to failure will become something of a theme. +

Let's go to the Thought Bubble. +

1. In February 1848, myriad interests came together to spark revolution in Paris and then in other French cities. +
2. Upper-class reformers objected to the cronyism, limited voting rights, and censorship. +
3. But in contrast, the prime minister, historian François Guizot, thought Louis-Philippe's government was just right. +
4. The crowds sent him and the king into exile. +
5. Those crowds were backed by the upper-class reformers, but they were fueled by discontented workers, the unemployed, and struggling artisans +
6. -- all affected by rising food prices as well as uncertain conditions of employment. +
7. A socialist different from the ones we've already talked about, Louis Blanc, was attuned to the needs of workers and the poor in Paris. +
8. He convinced the new provisional government to set up national workshops to create jobs for unemployed men. +
9. Women successfully demanded that workshops be established for them too and unsuccessfully nominated George Sand -- "male by virtue of virility, female by divine intuition" -- as a representative to the National Assembly." +
10. As spring progressed, a new national assembly, composed of less than ten percent workers, +
11. shut down the workshops and formed a new national police force composed of men from the countryside, +
12. who had little patience for city people and their city problems. +
13. In June, tens of thousands of workers rose up and fought the national police for several days, +
14. until the bodies were piled high and the workers defeated. +
15. Now a republic, France held elections based on universal male suffrage, +
16. which the nephew of Napoleon, Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, won handily, +
17. due to the support of peasants in the countryside. +
18. Lest you think the rural-urban divide is anything new. +

Thanks Thought Bubble. +

So, just as these revolutions started, a new socialist duo, German lawyer and journalist Karl Marx and Manchester textile mill owner Friedrich Engels, issued The Communist Manifesto. +

Its famous opening -- "A spectre is haunting Europe -- the spectre of communism" used the word communism instead of socialism based on the idea that society would soon revert to a traditional "community" of like-minded people. +

Marx and Engels believed that class struggle was going to erupt and wash away upper-class oppression, and that the proletariat would seize the means of production -- that is, factories and land and everything else would be shared by everyone, rather than owned by the few. +

And for the moment, that was pretty much it for "Marxist" socialism. But over the next half century, however, it would, of course, take a firmer theoretical shape and infuse workers' programs for change across the globe, and become tremendously influential. +

And while initially, few people paid attention to the Marxist ideas of class struggle, but some kind of struggle was certainly happening: The revolutions erupting across central and eastern Europe featured -- depending on who you were -- calls for the creation of constitutionally directed government structures, an end to serf-like oppression and censorship, restoration of aristocratic privileges, and yes, even democracy. +

In short, people wanted more power, and also greater rights and protection of those rights. And of course, then as now, ideas were not limited by borders. +

Like, news of the revolution in France sent Berlin's activists into the streets, pushing for an array of changes but mostly for the unification of the German states. +

King Frederick William IV, who was forced to witness the carnage on Berlin's streets, summoned a congress to meet at Frankfurt to plan for reform and unification. +

The meeting was dominated by the princes of the several dozen individual states, and it progressed slowly as the princes debated whether to include Austria in this unification project until the Prussian king, on being offered the crown of a constitutional monarchy refused to accept "a crown from the gutter." +

So instead, he would get no crown at all, and the German states would remain disunited. +

Did the Center of the World just open? Is there a gutter crown in there? I don't know if this gutter crown is for children, or if I just have an exceptionally large head, but regardless, if there is one lesson from 19th century Europe, it's that royals should take a gutter crown and be grateful for it. +

You know what's fun? Being the Queen of England, or of the Netherlands. You know what's not fun? Being the king of Germany. Because there is no king. +

OK. Let's turn our attention to Poland. +

So, already in 1846, Polish nationalists from the upper-classes in the Galician city of Cracow, hoped to lead a revolt against Austrian rule. but, peasants in the region refused to join them because Austrian rule was the peasants' only hope for gaining freedom from the payments and service that they owed aristocratic landowners. +

What's that? Stan says I have to take off the gutter crown. +

So, we like to think of revolutions as being neatly for freedoms or against them, but here we have an example of it being much more complicated. Because if you're in like, the upper classes in Poland, or a working person in a city, freedom might look like freedom from Austrian oppression. But if your a peasant, freedom looks like freedom from feudalism. +

So during that revolution, peasants rose up and slaughtered several thousand from the land-holding Polish nobility. You can see how Marx came to believe class struggle was inevitable. +

The same fragmentation appeared in March 1848 when an uprising broke out in cities across the Austrian empire. Remember Prince Metternich, architect of conservative reforms in Central Europe? By 1848 he was so unpopular that disliking him managed to unite the disparate interests of various classes and ethnic identities in the empire. +

Middle-class reformers wanted constitutional rule; aristocrats wanted more power than they had with Metternich's imperial bureaucracy running things, workers wanted both political and economic reforms, and peasants, of course, wanted an end to the last oppressive vestiges of feudalism. +

And in the face of temporary enthusiasm on all sides, Metternich fled the country in disguise. Later Emperor Ferdinand stepped down in favor of his nephew, Francis Joseph, whose nephew Francis -- or Franz -- Ferdinand would go on to be a rather famous assasination victim. +

Good God was there a rich person in central Europe not named Frederick or Francis or William or Louis or William-Louis or Frederick-William-Louis or Francis-Frederick-William-Louis? +

At any rate, with the common enemy of Metternich gone, the common purpose soon disappeared as well. Peasants across the empire were, as they had been in 1846, not terribly interested in the push for noble and middle-class rights. They retreated from the fight once the imperial government abolished all traditional dues and obligations to the nobility. +

And as for the liberals and aristocrats -- in Austria and across most of Europe -- they weren't thrilled with the idea of giving workers the right to vote. They believed that workers did not have a big picture perspective and instead were concerned with food, shelter, and taxes. +

As one privileged Austrian deputy put it: "we should prevent only those individuals from voting who live from a daily wage or who enjoy contributions from a charitable institution -- in short, those who are not independent." And many singled out Jewish people as being especially unworthy of rights. +

And just as the revolutions of 1848 paved the way for both reforms and conflicts in the 20th century, this exclusion of Jewish people from political participation and legal protection of rights was a harbinger of what was to come. Much of that anti-Semitism was focused in Eastern and Central Europe, but really it was everywhere. +

Ultimately, in Austria, as elsewhere, once the rebels were disunited, they were easier to defeat, and they were crushed in Vienna, Prague and other cities, and then in 1849, Tsar Nicholas I sent 300,000 troops to finish off the Hungarians for his Austrian ally. +

Around a hundred thousand people were killed across the Austrian empire in the revolutions of 1848 and thousands were killed elsewhere, not to mention the destruction of property that accompanied what were often massacres. +

Guarantees of rights were also rolled back and some participants were executed, or imprisoned, or sent into exile. And it's normal to wonder whether history is only the story of death and destruction and whether the outcomes were worth it. +

But consider the Austrian peasants who demanded and ultimately received an end to centuries of serfdom. Imagine knowing that you and your children and your children's children will be forced to live on and work the same land, owing an endless debt to the same aristocratic family that you'll never be able to repay. +

Now imagine the end of that cycle. Imagine being part of the first generation of people in living memory who could leave. Was the revolution worth it? Perhaps for those families, it was. +

Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time. +
