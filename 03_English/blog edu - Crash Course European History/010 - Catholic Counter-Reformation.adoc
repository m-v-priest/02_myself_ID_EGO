Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.
So, last week we took a break from religion to show that amidst 在…中间 warfare 战争 and bitter controversy 争论 over doctrine 教义, people were inventing and innovating 创新 and enslaving 奴役.

Europeans were eating new foods, hanging out more in cities, and making advances in commerce 商业 and legal protections for some people. While also inventing systems of oppression 压迫 to enslave others.

Years ago, historians firmly believed that the Protestant religion promoted capitalism 资本主义 — that is, all the business and commerce that were springing up at the time were caused by the Reformation 宗教改革.

Some historians still find that Martin Luther's otherworldly interests expanded to this-worldly activities, like reading, in ways that boosted 促进 prosperity 繁荣, but the rise of capitalism was complex, and also it happened in non-Protestant communities.

So today, let's shift perspectives back to how the Catholics were handling all this. Were they ready to simply surrender 投降 their influence in European society? Did the Church just turn its back on this momentous 重大的 challenge of Protestantism and continue down its much criticized path?

No. They responded. Leaders and the faithful created a sturdy 坚定的, even strident 尖锐的 Catholic-Reformation, or Counter-Reformation 反宗教改革, that also provided a little grease to the wheels of commerce.

And today we're gonna look at the Catholic Reformation and how it influenced not just Europe but the world.

The task of reform fell to Pope Paul III, who like many Renaissance popes lived in the lap of luxury and engaged in corrupt 腐败的 practices such as appointing two of his grandsons cardinals 红衣主教 in their early teens.

He only hired the best people. Also, why does this pope have grandsons? That reminds me of the great last words of the Irish poet, Brendan Behan.

A nun was giving him an injection, and he turned to her and said, "Bless you sister. May all your sons be bishops." Then he died.

But Pope Paul III knew, partly because of external pressure, that the Catholic Church needed to shape up. Several attempts at undertaking reforms in formal meetings were blocked by powerful individuals who liked the status quo 现状.

Powerful individuals and the status quo: The greatest love story of this or any time.

But the church was tired of seeing its overall power decrease, and so in 1545, the Council of Trent 特伦托会议, composed of high church officials, assembled 聚集 to stop the Protestant momentum 势头.

And this council continued until 1563, a series of meetings that lasted so long that by the time it was over, both Pope Paul III and his successor Julius III had died.

I've definitely had meetings that felt like they were 18 years long. I'm not sure if they were, though.

So, among the adherents 追随者 to Protestantism were some of the most powerful princes and members of the nobility in Europe. And some Catholic leaders wanted those powerful Protestants on their side.

But eventually the council eventually decided not to compromise. Instead, the pronouncements 声明 of the Council of Trent were stark 明确的 and emphatic 强调的.

Already in 1542 while waiting for a council actually to get organized, the papacy 教皇职位 had expanded the work of the Inquisition 宗教裁判所, which had been established in the 13th century to stamp out 消灭 heresies 异端邪说 in southern France and Italy.

But now the Inquisition targeted Protestants and searched for heresy also among conquered people in the New World.

The Council also affirmed 肯定 principles of transubstantiation 变体论 — that is, the belief that the bread and wine of the communion sacrament 圣餐仪式 become the actual body and blood of Jesus.

It upheld 支持 the centrality 中心地位 of the seven sacraments 圣礼, and the selling of indulgences 赎罪券 stuck around too. Clergy 神职人员 were to remain celibate 独身的 and chaste 纯洁的 — unlike most Protestant clerics 牧师.

And all Catholics were to live by faith and practice good works as their path to salvation 救赎 — not by faith alone like the Protestants.

The church also began establishing seminaries 神学院 where priests could become more informed in Catholic theology 神学. And reformers felt this training was sorely 迫切地 needed for priests because they were being confronted by complicated Protestant challenges to Catholic doctrine.

And the Church began the Papal Index 教皇禁书目录, a list of books that Catholics were forbidden to read; In addition the Church reached deeper into society when it began to further regulate marriages.

With the creation of a list of forbidden books and the declaration of power over marriage, the Counter-Reformation took Catholicism from a point of weakness and actually expanded its power.

At least over those who believed.

Even before these events, what would become a major bulwark 堡垒 of Catholicism and its Counter-Reformation was taking shape.

Because in the 1520s, after being shot as a soldier in one of Spain's wars, a Spanish nobleman took up the challenge to fortify 巩固 Catholicism.

Just as Luther wrestled with his faith, Ignatius of Loyola suffered spiritual agonies 痛苦 and emerged a charismatic 有魅力的 leader — but unlike Luther, Ignatius and his followers remained loyal to the Catholic Church.

In 1540, the Pope declared Ignatius's followers a religious order called the Society of Jesus or "Jesuits 耶稣会士".

Many pre-existing Catholic religious orders were rededicating themselves to protect and nourish their faith. But Loyola's approach was especially effective given the challenges from Protestantism in the 1520s and thereafter.

First, because he organized and ran his group like an army around a hierarchy 等级制度 of command; joining required several years of training and a strict code of discipline 纪律.

And all of this was timely given the Church's reputation for corruption, lax morals 道德松弛, and in many cases, priestly incompetence 不称职, including ignorance of Latin.

That wasn't a problem with the Jesuits.

Second, the Jesuits founded schools where humanistic education 人文主义教育 thrived 兴盛 alongside religious instruction 教导.

These became a mechanism 机制 for combining the latest in intellectual practice with the revitalization 复兴 and reaffirmation 重申 of Catholic theology, and it was important because one of the attractions of Protestantism was its emphasis on broader literacy 识字率 so that everyone could directly connect with scripture 经文.

The Jesuits argued that Catholics could also spread education — which is why incidentally 顺便说一句 there are so many Loyola Universities around the world.

And that brings us to our final point: In addition to reforming Catholicism in Europe, the Jesuits undertook 从事 globalizing the faith as a regular part of their mission.

Through them, Catholicism truly did become a world religion, reaching India, and Japan, and Africa, and the New World.

And this Jesuit activism 积极活动 in establishing global relationships would eventually transform Europe in ways that have only recently gained the attention of historians.

Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

The Jesuits interacted worldwide with an eye on both short and long-term results — they wanted to convert 使皈依 souls, but they also wanted through schools to shape the way that young people learned, and thus their perspective 观点.

It's important to remember that no education is morally neutral 中立的 — what you learn about shapes the way you look at the world.

And as they traveled, the Jesuits were in constant touch with one another comparing best practices, and they also adapted different strategies to different parts of the world as their order spread across the globe.

They studied local languages before approaching people and in many cases took elements from local beliefs and tried to persuade those they wished to convert that Catholic beliefs were basically identical to local ones.

And it was effective. In China, there were 38,000 converts to Catholicism by 1633. By 1650, there were over a hundred thousand.

Once the Jesuits established these global contacts, they produced reports, first in Latin but then translated into local European languages, and their work created a Eurocentric 以欧洲为中心的 globalization that went way beyond religion.

For example, they became an early version of industrial spies 间谍 when it came to producing porcelain 瓷器, reporting back from China to Europe about the processes that went in to making high-quality porcelain.

Spreading Catholicism was their mission, but the Jesuits were among those advancing commercial and agricultural development as well.

Thanks, Thought Bubble.

Many Catholics really took the Church's reforms to heart, intensifying 加强 their devotions 信仰, sometimes in ways that also helped further the religion's influence around the world.

Among the most renowned 著名的 was the Spanish mystic 神秘主义者 and nun Saint Teresa of Avila, who had a very long birth name that I will not attempt to pronounce.

I mean, mispronouncing things is my thing, but there's no reason to go down that road.

At twenty, she escaped the confines 限制 of her home where she was recuperating 康复 from one of her many, and lifelong, bouts 发作 of illness to join the Carmelite order of nuns.

But once there, she balked at 回避 the superficiality 肤浅 and high society life of constant visits and fancy food.

She began to live out the reformed Church's rededication to faith and good works, being extremely strict in her practice.

She was a proponent 支持者 of self-flagellation 自我鞭挞 ceremonies — self-flagellation being the act of hitting one's self with a whip in imitation of Christ's suffering at the cross.

And she became an inspiration particularly after church leaders had her write down her spiritual experiences in several books that have now become Counter-Reformation classics, such as *Way of Perfection* and *The Book of Foundations*.

At the same time, she went about founding new "discalceate" (shoeless or barefoot) Carmelite religious orders, restoring austerity 苦行 and strictness to religious life.

The Council of Trent had also issued a statement about art, advising that it needed to connect with ordinary people, including the poor.

The aim was not to produce subtle or erudite 博学的 symbolism 象征主义 but to strike emotions, inducing 引发 awe 敬畏 and evoking 唤起 the power and majesty 威严 of the divine.

Gian Lorenzo Bernini produced such effects, for example in the piazza 广场 in front of St. Peter's Basilica.

It features massed columns 柱群, which produce a dramatic setting for papal ritual 仪式.

Protestants had smashed ornate 华丽的 statuary 雕像 of saints and the holy family and instead created simple, unadorned 朴素的 places of worship.

But Catholics embraced majestic 庄严的 religious interiors, enhancing religious figures through the use of light and shade in paintings of Jesus, angels, saints, and the royalty surrounding the divine —

All of which were part of a new style called baroque 巴洛克式的.

Did the world just open? Is there a tiny little baby Jesus dressed up fancy back there?

Indeed, it is the Infant of Prague, or at least a three dollar recreation of it...

So you can see here, this baby Jesus is in a very fancy dress, and I...listen...if I were a tiny baby Jesus, I would wear this fancy dress, but if you've read the gospels, you'll know that like, this is not how tiny baby Jesus dressed.

It is, however, super baroque, emphasizing the majesty of the divine.

And religious statuary like this also expressed the intensity of the Counter-Reformation and its leading figures.

Bernini's statue of St. Teresa of Avila, for instance, would seem to contradict 与…矛盾 the asceticism 禁欲主义 of rejecting ones shoes.

Yet it expressed the ecstatic 狂喜的 relationship with the divine and an overflow of feeling and belief.

Likewise, baroque music expressed complexity through the use of counterpoint 对位法 and emotional and thunderous chords 和弦 that filled parishioners 教区居民 — both illiterate 文盲的 and learned — with religious awe.

One artist who took up the baroque style, some would say with a vengeance 激烈地, was Artemisia Gentileschi.

Trained by her father, Orazio, Gentileschi was raped by a man who'd been hired to give her additional instruction.

She herself was tortured with thumbscrews 拇指夹 by the court in order to ensure that she was telling the truth when her father brought suit against the rapist.

One of the few ways to get revenge...painting.

The frightening *Judith Slaying Holofernes* for instance shows the biblical heroine 女英雄 and her maid getting revenge on the general Holofernes who threatened her people's survival.

From the dramatic imagery 意象 to the high contrast of dark and light, this painting is exemplary 典范的 of counter-reformation art — it evokes 唤起 the senses and an emotional connection to God's word, and it ain't subtle.

So, between the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation, people obsessively 痴迷地 confronted some of the major issues of human existence, right?

Faith, the divine, and the human conduct that should accompany religious belief, and we're still not finished with the repercussions 影响 of this questioning and the responses to it.

These religious upheavals 动荡 weren't just about how to get into heaven; they were also about who should learn and how, and what constituted 构成 an effective human life.

We are still in the shadow of those who modeled new ideas of what matters in human life.

We'll have much more to say about Catholicism and the role of organized religion in people's lives, but first….next week we dig into the world of witchcraft 巫术, shamans 萨满, magic, and alchemy 炼金术, which were also important belief systems in early modern Europe and ones that co-existed with Christianity.

That's right, friends, it will soon be time to turn lead into gold and frog eyes into hex potions. I'll see you then.

大家好，我是约翰·格林，这里是《速成欧洲史》。 + 
上周我们暂别宗教话题，探讨了在教义纷争与战争冲突中，人们如何发明创新，同时又建立压迫体系奴役他人。 + 
 + 
*欧洲人开始食用新食物，更多聚集在城市中，推动商业发展, 并为部分人争取法律保护，却也发明压迫制度奴役另一群人。* + 
 + 
*多年前，历史学家坚定认为, "新教"促进了资本主义——即当时兴起的所有商业活动, 均由"宗教改革"引发。 + 
部分历史学家仍认为，马丁·路德（Martin Luther）对"宗教彼岸"的关注, 延伸至对现世活动（如阅读）的重视，从而推动了繁荣。但资本主义的兴起极为复杂，且在非新教社区同样发生。* + 
 + 
那么今天，我们将视角转回**"天主教的应对"。他们是否准备轻易放弃在欧洲社会的影响力？教会是否对"新教"的重大挑战置之不理，继续走备受批评的老路？** + 
 + 
不，**他们做出了回应。**教会领袖与信徒**发起了一场坚定甚至激进的“天主教改革”（Catholic-Reformation）或称“反宗教改革”（Counter-Reformation），**这一运动甚至为商业发展提供了助力。 + 
 + 
今天我们将探讨"天主教改革", 及其如何影响欧洲乃至全球。 + 
 + 
改革的重任, 落在教皇保罗三世（Pope Paul III）肩上。与许多文艺复兴时期的教皇一样，他生活奢华，行事腐败——例如在两个孙子年仅十几岁时, 便任命他们为红衣主教。 + 
他“只选用最优秀的人”。不过，**为何这位教皇会有孙子？**这让我想起爱尔兰诗人布兰登·贝汉（Brendan Behan）的临终妙语。 + 
一位修女为他注射时，他转向她说：“愿主保佑你，修女。愿你所有儿子都成为主教。”随后便去世了。 + 
 + 
但保罗三世深知（部分因外部压力）, 天主教会需要整顿。*此前多次在正式会议中推动改革的尝试，均被安于现状的权贵阻挠。* + 
权贵与现状：古往今来最伟大的爱情故事。 + 
 + 
但教会已厌倦目睹自身权力衰退，于是在1545年，由高级神职人员组成的"特伦托会议"（Council of Trent）召开，旨在遏制"新教"发展势头。 + 
这场会议持续至1563年，漫长的会期甚至让保罗三世及其继任者尤里乌斯三世（Julius III）都在会议结束前离世。 + 
我确实参加过让人感觉长达18年的会议，不过不确定是否真有那么久。 + 
 + 
当时，欧洲部分最有权势的诸侯和贵族, 皈依了新教，部分天主教领袖希望拉拢这些有权势的新教徒。 + 
但会议最终决定不妥协。特伦托会议的宣言鲜明而强硬。 + 
 + 
*早在1542年，教会等待会议筹备期间，便扩大了##"宗教裁判所"（Inquisition）的职权。该机构成立于13世纪，旨在镇压法国南部和意大利的异端，如今目标转向"新教徒"，并在新大陆的被征服人群中搜捕异端。##* + 

- 会议还重申了“变体论”（transubstantiation）原则——即认为圣餐中的饼与酒, 实为耶稣的身体与血。 + 
- *会议维护"七圣礼"的核心地位，"赎罪券"的售卖也得以保留。#神职人员需保持独身禁欲——与多数"新教"神职人员不同。#* + 
- *#所有天主教徒, 需通过信仰与善行, 走向救赎——而非如新教徒般“因信称义”。#* + 

**教会开始建立"神学院"，**让神职人员深入学习天主教神学。改革者认为，面对"新教"对"天主教教义"的复杂挑战，神职人员急需此类培训。 + 
教会还编制了《禁书目录》（Papal Index），列出天主教徒禁止阅读的书籍；此外，教会进一步介入社会，加强对婚姻的规范。 + 
通过制定禁书目录, 与宣布对婚姻的管辖权，"反宗教改革"使天主教从弱势中重振，并切实扩张了权力——至少在信徒中如此。 + 
 + 
甚至在这些事件之前，天主教及其反宗教改革的重要支柱, 已在形成。 + 
16世纪20年代，一位西班牙贵族, 在西班牙的一场战争中中弹受伤后，决心巩固天主教信仰。 + 
正如路德与自己的信仰搏斗，伊格那丢·罗耀拉（Ignatius of Loyola）历经精神煎熬，成为魅力领袖——但与路德不同，伊格那丢及其追随者, 始终效忠天主教会。 + 
 + 
1540年，*教皇将伊格那丢的追随者, 定为“耶稣会”(信奉天主教的)（Society of Jesus或“Jesuits”）。* + 
许多现存天主教修会, 重新致力于保护与滋养信仰，但鉴于16世纪20年代及之后"新教"的挑战，罗耀拉的方法尤为有效。 + 
首先，他将耶稣会, 像军队一样按等级制度组织管理；加入者需经过数年训练，并遵守严格的纪律准则。 + 
这一切恰逢其时，*因为教会正面临腐败、道德松弛, 以及（在许多情况下）神职人员无能（包括不懂拉丁语）的负面声誉，而耶稣会不存在这些问题。* + 
 + 
其次，*耶稣会创办学校，将"人文教育"与宗教 instruction 结合。* + 
*这成为将"最新学术实践", 与"天主教神学复兴"相结合的机制，至关重要——#因为"新教"的吸引力之一在于强调普及识字，使所有人能直接与《圣经》连接。#* + 
*耶稣会认为, 天主教徒也可推广教育——这也是为何全球有如此多以“罗耀拉”命名的大学。* + 
 + 
这引出我们最后一点：*除了在欧洲改革天主教，耶稣会将"信仰全球化", 作为其常规使命的一部分。* + 
**通过他们，天主教真正成为世界宗教，**传播至印度、日本、非洲和新大陆。 + 
耶稣会建立全球联系的行动, 最终改变了欧洲，其影响直到最近才引起历史学家的关注。 + 
 + 
让我们进入“思想泡泡”环节。 + 
 + 
*耶稣会在全球活动中, 兼顾短期与长期目标——他们希望转化灵魂，也希望通过学校塑造年轻人的学习方式，进而影响其观念。 + 
#重要的是要记住：没有哪种教育是道德中立的——你所学的内容(意识形态), 会塑造你看待世界的方式。#* + 
 + 
**耶稣会士在旅行中保持密切联系，交流最佳实践(迭代"传教的方法论")，并随着修会扩展至全球，针对不同地区调整策略。** + 
*#他们在接触当地人之前, 先学习当地语言，并在许多情况下吸收当地信仰元素，试图说服皈依者相信, "天主教信仰"与"当地信仰"基本一致。#* + 
*这一方法行之有效：截至1633年，中国有3.8万天主教皈依者；至1650年，这一数字超过十万。* + 
 + 
耶稣会建立这些全球联系后，开始撰写报告（最初用拉丁语，后译为欧洲当地语言），他们的工作促成了一种以欧洲为中心的全球化，其影响远超宗教范畴。 + 
例如，在瓷器制作方面，他们成为早期“工业间谍”，将中国的高品质瓷器制作工艺传回欧洲。 + 
传播天主教是其使命，但耶稣会也推动了商业与农业发展。 + 
 + 
感谢“思想泡泡”。 + 
 + 
许多天主教徒真心接纳教会改革，深化自身信仰，其方式有时也助力宗教影响力在全球传播。 + 
其中最著名的人物之一是西班牙神秘主义者、修女阿维拉的圣特蕾莎（Saint Teresa of Avila），*她的本名极长，我不打算尝试发音。 + 
虽然念错名字是我的“专长”(就算是美国人自己,也不一定看到人家的名字就能读对发音)，但没必要自找麻烦。* + 
 + 
20岁时，她从家中逃脱——当时她因终身困扰的多种疾病之一正在休养，随后加入加尔默罗会（Carmelite order）成为修女。 + 
但进入修会后，她对表面化的上流社会生活（频繁访客与精致饮食）感到不满，开始践行改革教会对信仰与善行的重新承诺，修行极为严格。 + 
她支持“自笞”仪式——即用鞭子抽打自己，效仿基督在十字架上的苦难。 + 
教会领袖让她将"属灵经历"写成多本书籍，这些著作, 后来成为"反宗教改革"的经典，如《完美之道》（Way of Perfection）和《奠基之书》（The Book of Foundations），她也因此成为鼓舞人心的人物。 +
同时，她着手建立新的“赤足”加尔默罗修会（discalceate Carmelite religious orders），为宗教生活恢复苦行与严格戒律。 + 
 +

*特伦托会议, 也发布了关于艺术的声明，建议"艺术"需与"包括穷人在内的普通人"建立连接，目标不是创造晦涩或博学的象征，而是打动情感，引发敬畏，唤起神圣的力量与威严。* +
吉安·洛伦佐·贝尼尼（Gian Lorenzo Bernini）便在圣彼得大教堂（St. Peter's Basilica）前的广场, 营造了这种效果。 +
广场上密集的柱群, 为教皇仪式创造了戏剧性的背景。 +
**#"新教"教徒曾砸碎华丽的圣像和圣家雕像，转而打造简洁朴素的礼拜场所；但"天主教徒"拥抱庄严的宗教内饰，#**通过耶稣、天使、圣徒, 及神圣周边“王室”画作中的光影对比，凸显宗教人物—— *这一切均属于被称为“巴洛克”（baroque）的新风格。* +
 +

世界又“打开”了吗？后面是否有穿着华丽的小耶稣像？ + 
确实，这是“布拉格婴儿耶稣像”（Infant of Prague），或至少是三美元的仿制品…… + 
你看，这个婴儿耶稣, 穿着非常华丽的衣服。听着，如果我是婴儿耶稣，我会穿这件华丽的衣服，但如果你读过福音书就会知道，婴儿耶稣并非如此打扮。 +
但**#它确实极具巴洛克风格，强调神圣的威严。#** +
此类宗教雕像, 也体现了"反宗教改革"及其领袖人物的强烈情感。 +
例如，贝尼尼的阿维拉的圣特蕾莎雕像，看似与“赤足”的苦行相悖，却表达了与神的狂喜联结, 及Overflow的情感与信仰。 +
 + 
#*同样，巴洛克音乐, 通过对位法与震撼的情感"和弦", 展现复杂性，让信众（无论文盲或学者）都充满宗教敬畏。*# +
阿尔泰米西娅·真蒂莱斯基（Artemisia Gentileschi）是践行**巴洛克风格的艺术家之一，有人认为她的作品充满“复仇般的激情”。** +
真蒂莱斯基, 由父亲奥拉齐奥（Orazio）培养，却被一位受雇为她提供额外指导的男子强奸。 +
当父亲对强奸犯提起诉讼时，她本人竟被法庭用拇指夹刑讯，以确保她所言属实。 + 
她实现复仇的少数方式之一是——绘画。 + 
例如，令人震撼的《朱迪斯杀死霍洛芬斯》（Judith Slaying Holofernes）, 描绘了圣经中的女英雄与女仆, 向威胁其民族生存的霍洛芬斯将军复仇的场景。 +
从戏剧性的意象, 到强烈的明暗对比，这幅画堪称"反宗教改革"艺术的典范——*它唤起感官共鸣, 与对上帝话语的情感连接，且毫不含蓄。* +
 + 
因此，在"宗教改革"与"反宗教改革"之间，人们执着地探讨人类存在的重大议题，对吧？ +
信仰、神性，以及与宗教信仰相伴的人类行为，而这场质疑与回应的余波, 至今未消。 +
*#这些宗教动荡, 不仅关乎如何进入天堂，还关乎谁该学习、如何学习，以及何为有意义的人生。(宗教即人生哲学)#* +
我们仍处在那些为人类生活“何为重要”树立新观念者的影响之下。 + 
 + 
关于天主教及有组织宗教, 在人们生活中的角色，我们还有很多可探讨，但首先……下周我们将深入巫术、萨满、魔法与炼金术的世界，这些都是近代早期欧洲的重要信仰体系，且与基督教并存。 +
没错，朋友们，很快我们就要探讨如何将铅炼成黄金，把蛙眼制成诅咒药水了。届时见。

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.
So, last week we took a break from religion to show that amidst warfare and bitter controversy over doctrine, people were inventing and innovating and enslaving.

Spreading Catholicism was their mission, but the Jesuits were among those advancing commercial and agricultural development as well.

Thanks, Thought Bubble.

Many Catholics really took the Church's reforms to heart, intensifying their devotions, sometimes in ways that also helped further the religion's influence around the world.

Among the most renowned was the Spanish mystic and nun Saint Teresa of Avila, who had a very long birth name that I will not attempt to pronounce.

I mean, mispronouncing things is my thing, but there's no reason to go down that road.

At twenty, she escaped the confines of her home where she was recuperating from one of her many, and lifelong, bouts of illness to join the Carmelite order of nuns.

But once there, she balked at the superficiality and high society life of constant visits and fancy food.

She began to live out the reformed Church's rededication to faith and good works, being extremely strict in her practice.

She was a proponent of self-flagellation ceremonies -- self-flagellation being the act of hitting one's self with a whip in imitation of Christ's suffering at the cross.

And she became an inspiration particularly after church leaders had her write down her spiritual experiences in several books that have now become Counter-Reformation classics, such as Way of Perfection and The Book of Foundations.

At the same time, she went about founding new "discalceate" (shoeless or barefoot) Carmelite religious orders, restoring austerity and strictness to religious life.

The Council of Trent had also issued a statement about art, advising that it needed to connect with ordinary people, including the poor.

The aim was not to produce subtle or erudite symbolism but to strike emotions, inducing awe and evoking the power and majesty of the divine.

Gian Lorenzo Bernini produced such effects, for example in the piazza in front of St. Peter's Basilica.

It features massed columns, which produce a dramatic setting for papal ritual.

Protestants had smashed ornate statuary of saints and the holy family and instead created simple, unadorned places of worship.

But Catholics embraced majestic religious interiors, enhancing religious figures through the use of light and shade in paintings of Jesus, angels, saints, and the royalty surrounding the divine --

All of which were part of a new style called baroque.

Did the world just open? Is there a tiny little baby Jesus dressed up fancy back there?

Indeed, it is the Infant of Prague, or at least a three dollar recreation of it...

So you can see here, this baby Jesus is in a very fancy dress, and I...listen...if I were a tiny baby Jesus, I would wear this fancy dress, but if you've read the gospels, you'll know that like, this is not how tiny baby Jesus dressed.

It is, however, super baroque, emphasizing the majesty of the divine.

And religious statuary like this also expressed the intensity of the Counter-Reformation and its leading figures.

Bernini's statue of St. Teresa of Avila, for instance, would seem to contradict the asceticism of rejecting ones shoes.

Yet it expressed the ecstatic relationship with the divine and an overflow of feeling and belief.

Likewise, baroque music expressed complexity through the use of counterpoint and emotional and thunderous chords that filled parishioners -- both illiterate and learned -- with religious awe.

One artist who took up the baroque style, some would say with a vengeance, was Artemisia Gentileschi.

Trained by her father, Orazio, Gentileschi was raped by a man who'd been hired to give her additional instruction.

She herself was tortured with thumbscrews by the court in order to ensure that she was telling the truth when her father brought suit against the rapist.

One of the few ways to get revenge...painting.

The frightening "Judith Slaying Holofernes" for instance shows the biblical heroine and her maid getting revenge on the general Holofernes who threatened her people's survival.

From the dramatic imagery to the high contrast of dark and light, this painting is exemplary of counter-reformation art -- it evokes the senses and an emotional connection to God's word, and it ain't subtle.

So, between the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation, people obsessively confronted some of the major issues of human existence, right?

Faith, the divine, and the human conduct that should accompany religious belief, and we're still not finished with the repercussions of this questioning and the responses to it.

These religious upheavals weren't just about how to get into heaven; they were also about who should learn and how, and what constituted an effective human life.

We are still in the shadow of those who modeled new ideas of what matters in human life.

We'll have much more to say about Catholicism and the role of organized religion in people's lives, but first….next week we dig into the world of witchcraft, shamans, magic, and alchemy, which were also important belief systems in early modern Europe and ones that co-existed with Christianity.

That's right, friends, it will soon be time to turn lead into gold and frog eyes into hex potions. I'll see you then.
