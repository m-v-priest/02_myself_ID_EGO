== 释义

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History. +

So if you look at Europe today, you'll note that two of the European Union's 欧盟的 largest economies -- Italy and Germany -- have not existed as unified kingdoms 统一王国 or sovereign states 主权国家 during our first 26 episodes. +

We tend to think of Europe's nation states 民族国家 as static 静态的 and longstanding 长期存在的, but one of my great grandfathers was born before Italy became a unified country. +

Now, I know that I'm old, but I'm not that old. +

What's that? +

Oh, our script supervisor 剧本监制 Zulaiha informs me that I am that old. +

At any rate 无论如何, all the stereotypes 刻板印象 we have of these national identities 民族身份 -- that Italians talk with their hands, that Germans have extremely punctual 极其准时的 public transport 公共交通 -- are quite new, because in 1850, most Italians wouldn't have called themselves "Italians." +

They would've been Genoese 热那亚人, or Sicilian 西西里人, or Veronese 维罗纳人. +

The post-revolutionary 革命后的 European world became one of dramatic nation-building 国家构建 that ultimately 最终 set the stage for 为…奠定基础 20th century nationalistic fervor 民族主义狂热. +

But before we can get nationalist passions riled up 激起, we need to make some more nations. +

[Intro] +

The first of the disruptive 颠覆性的 nation-builders was Napoleon III (Napoleon Bonaparte's nephew 侄子), who on December 2, 1851 declared himself emperor 皇帝 -- 48 years to the day after his uncle had done the same. +

He set out to create a lavish court 奢华的宫廷, boost the economy 促进经济, create banks, build railroads, and otherwise modernize 使现代化 France. +

Politically, he set up a rubber-stamp legislature 橡皮图章式的立法机构, meaning that mostly they just existed to agree with him. +

He also outlawed 取缔 worker activism 工人运动. +

Napoleon III's modus operandi 行事方式 was war, as it would be for many of the nation-builders of the mid 19th-century. +

He helped provoke 挑起 the Crimean War 克里米亚战争, a short, miserable 悲惨的, and especially deadly war. +

In it, France, Britain, and the Ottoman Empire 奥斯曼帝国 fought Russia, which had been challenging Britain across Asia. +

And the special genius of Napoleon III was to get Austria to not come to the aid of 援助 Russia and instead to remain neutral 保持中立. +

This cracked 瓦解 the Holy Alliance 神圣同盟 of Russia, Prussia, and Austria that had been set up to stabilize 稳定 Europe. +

And Russia's defeat in the war ensured that it would not help squash 镇压 revolution as it had in 1848. +

Instead, Russia reeled from 深受…影响 its military and other shortcomings 不足. +

By the 1860s, the tsar 沙皇 recognized the need to free the serfs 农奴, reform the military 军队, and set up modern judicial procedures 司法程序 in order to save its autocratic system 专制制度. +

Or to save it for another 50 years anyway. +

Let's go to the Thought Bubble. +

1. Napoleon III used the peace after the Crimean War to remake 改造 Paris into a modern world capital. +
2. And to the south, Camillo di Cavour 加富尔 aimed to create a unified Italian state 统一的意大利国家. +
3. Like Napoleon, he was an economic modernizer 经济现代化推动者 who set up steamship companies 轮船公司, experimented in agriculture 农业试验, and traveled to see the latest in modernization projects 现代化项目. +
4. Cavour became prime minister 首相 for the king of Piedmont-Sardinia 皮埃蒙特 - 撒丁王国国王, who allowed him to move forward with 推进 his modernization plans. +
5. Napoleon III saw advantages in supporting Cavour, so he signed on as an ally 盟友 in defeating Austria, which controlled northern Italy. +
6. Napoleon's idea was that Piedmont 皮埃蒙特 would get Austria's territory 领土 in northern Italy, Napoleon would get the center, and the pope 教皇 would rule kind of an Italian confederation 意大利联邦. +
7. So, in accordance with 按照 this plan, in 1859, Piedmont provoked 激怒 Austria into declaring war 宣战 and gained quick victories 迅速获胜. +
8. But Cavour and his army looked so good in victory that Italians rallied behind 团结在…背后 him, +
9. and were like, I think we want to be Italian and not French, thus thwarting 挫败 Napoleon's plans. +
10. In 1860, the revolutionary and democrat 革命者和民主主义者 Giuseppe Garibaldi 朱塞佩·加里波第 gathered up 召集 a thousand volunteers -- mostly teenagers -- clad 给…穿衣 them in red shirts, +
11. and headed by ship to Sicily 西西里岛, where revolts 起义 against aristocratic landlords 贵族地主 were already underway 正在进行中. +
12. He planned to capture 占领 the south for a united Italy. +
13. And in 1860, he and his forces succeeded in doing so, +
14. then they moved northward 向北 to unite with 与…联合 the forces of Piedmont. +
15. And in 1861, the kingdom of Italy 意大利王国 was declared. +

Thanks Thought Bubble. +

So a small pause is necessary here. +

Why is Garibaldi, a pro-republic 支持共和制的, romantic leader 浪漫主义领袖, working on behalf of 代表 a monarch 君主 like the king of Piedmont? +

Why is Cavour, the modernizer 现代化推动者 and prime minister of a monarchy 君主制首相, joining the likes of Garibaldi? +

Well, by the 1850s, romantic dreams of national unification 国家统一 and the rule of the people 人民统治 gave way to 让位于 what is known as realpolitik 现实政治 or power politics 强权政治 or realism in politics 政治现实主义. +

Gone were the heartfelt assertions 真诚的主张 that political actions were the will of God or that they achieved some divine 神圣的 or romantic destiny 浪漫的命运 on behalf of the nation. +

Better, it was argued, to be realistic 现实的 and get things done. +

German politician Otto von Bismarck 奥托·冯·俾斯麦 expressed realpolitik best when he said "Germany looks not to Prussia's liberalism... The great questions of the day will not be settled by speeches and majority decisions... but by blood and iron." +

Bismarck became one of the most successful practitioners 实践者 of realpolitik and in the process created the modern German empire 现代德意志帝国. +

As a young adult, Bismarck's life had virtually 几乎 no seriousness of purpose 目标严肃性. +

I had one of those young adulthoods as well. +

Born a well-to-do landed aristocrat 富裕的地主贵族 or Junker 容克贵族, he was a carouser 狂欢者, imbiber 饮酒者, and generally a lout 粗人 as a university student. +

Boy, this is familiar. +

He built up so many debts that he gave up a career in the civil service 公务员职业 to return home and help run the family farms. +

All right. +

Finally our lives are diverging 不同. +

And I guess they're about to diverge further, since he was arguably 可以说 the most important European politician of the second half of the nineteenth century, and I'm...you know. +

On the other hand, I've never started a war! +

Bismarck's life got more serious after he met and married Johanna Puttkammer, a devout Lutheran 虔诚的路德教徒, who gave him a more peaceful home life to balance the political turmoil 政治动荡 that he came to embrace. +

His ultimate ambition 最终抱负 was to leave estate management 庄园管理 and become a major player 重要人物 in German and international politics, but I've known a lot of drunken heavily indebted partiers, and they all have big dreams. +

What makes Bismarck so astonishing 令人惊讶的 is the extent to which he succeeded. +

He made his return to the political scene 政治舞台 as Prussia's delegate 代表 to assemblies of the German states 德意志邦国议会 and then as ambassador to Russia 驻俄大使. +

And through these roles, the staunchly 坚定地 monarchist 君主主义者 Bismarck learned lessons about diplomacy 外交, and international affairs 国际事务, and about economic liberals 经济自由主义者 and their constitutional values 宪法价值观. +

He came not to oppose a constitution per se 本身 nor to oppose economic progress 经济发展. +

What he did above all else 最重要的是 was support Prussian King William I 普鲁士国王威廉一世. +

So we shouldn't see Bismarck so much as opposed to this or that kind of reform so much as strongly in favor of a unified Germany under the leadership of a king. +

In 1862 William I wanted army reform 军队改革 and modernization 现代化 as did some liberals, but William refused to budge on 让步 certain other provisions 条款, especially a three-year term for recruits 新兵三年服役期. +

And Bismarck promised not to budge either and then he went ahead with 推进 the king's version of reform, bypassing 绕过 the parliament altogether by simply collecting taxes and dispensing 分配 them as the king wanted. +

This among many other actions made Bismarck enemies of all kinds, partly because of his bullying manner 专横的态度, but he continued to be supported by the one person who counted -- the Prussian king. +

So, for several decades, but most pressingly in the post-1848 atmosphere, a major question was who would lead the Germans -- Austria or Prussia. +

Serving King William I loyally 忠诚地 was Bismarck's key to promoting Prussia as the dominant power 主导力量 for Germans. +

Sometimes people interpret Bismarck as like, an all-seeing visionary 有远见卓识的人 who carefully plotted 谋划 every step he took on behalf of Prussia... But historians have now mostly come to believe that Bismarck's political moves 政治举措 were not part of some pre-planned game of 4D chess 预先计划好的复杂策略 to outmaneuver 智取 Austria; instead, he just had a wonderful gift for improvisation 即兴发挥. +

For example, in 1864, he made an alliance 联盟 with Austria to settle the status of two contested provinces 有争议的省份 -- Schleswig 石勒苏益格 and Holstein 荷尔斯泰因. +

So, Bismarck persuaded 说服 Austria to join Prussia in war against Denmark to resolve the contested rule of Schleswig-Holstein. +

Their victory gave Prussia administration 管理 of Schleswig and Austria got Holstein. +

Two years later, Prussia and Austria went to war again, this time with each other over the same two provinces. +

The Austro-Prussian war 普奥战争 lasted just over six weeks, thanks to Prussia's aforementioned 前面提到的 commitment to the professionalism 职业化 and modernization of its army. +

So this whole affair 事件 was masterfully handled 巧妙处理 by Bismarck; first, get your enemy Austria to help you defeat your other enemy Denmark, then defeat Austria and boom, congratulations, you've got Schleswig Holstein, which only sounds like a disease. +

But it likely wasn't planned that way. +

Did the center of the world just open? +

Is there a magic 8 ball in there? +

All right magic 8 ball, is the European Union going to hold up OK? +

It is certain! +

The thing about history is that it always feels certain because, you know, it already happened. +

So when we in the present look at Bismarck in the past and the unification of Germany 德国统一, it all feels, like, extraordinarily strategic 极具战略性的. +

But I would argue that, in the multiverse 多元宇宙, there's a bunch of worlds where it doesn't work out the way it worked out for us. +

History is what happens to have happened, and we are all making that together, just as Bismarck and everyone else in nineteenth century Europe was making it. +

But back to Bismarck... +

So, following the big victory, Prussia's King William wanted to keep going, to capture Vienna 维也纳 and maybe even Hungary, but Bismarck, with his usual astuteness 敏锐 in international affairs, encouraged the king to pull back 撤退 and consolidate 巩固, as Prussia was now the leading German nation. +

Bismarck had drawn 吸引 the northern German kingdoms and states into the North German Confederation 北德意志邦联, while also aiming to draw in 吸引 the German states that were still resisting joining Prussia. +

And how he did this was kind of brilliant in a dark artsy sort of way. +

Bismarck deeply understood the growing power of mass market media 大众市场媒体 like newspapers, and he knew how to feed rumors to 向…散布谣言 them. +

For instance, there was a battle over who would take the throne of tiny Luxembourg 卢森堡 -- someone allied with Prussia, or someone allied with Napoleon III. +

As the contest heated up 愈演愈烈, Bismarck got a personal quote in the papers to the effect that the French were "not the fine people they are usually considered to be," and were in fact "loudmouthed" 爱说大话的 people given over to "bold, violent behavior." +

Meanwhile, he also doctored 篡改 a telegram 电报 sent from the Prussian king to make it appear insulting to 侮辱 the French. +

And then in August 1870, the French National Assembly 法国国民议会, outraged at 对…感到愤怒 these characterizations 描述, declared war 宣战. +

The French were handily defeated 轻易击败, with Napoleon III and an army of 150,000 people captured on September 2. +

The Bavarians 巴伐利亚人 along with smaller states had had to join Prussia. +

And in January 1871, the German Empire 德意志帝国 was declared in the Hall of Mirrors 镜厅 of the Versailles palace 凡尔赛宫, and all because of Luxembourg. +

Although much of the earlier opposition to Bismarck died down 平息 at this point, he still had to forge 打造 a nation from these disparate states 不同的邦国 -- one with its own institutions 机构 and its own culture. +

This was a fraught task 艰巨的任务, which he did in his signature style 独特风格: more experimentally than surefootedly 更多是试验性地而非稳扎稳打地. +

Bismarck's specific moves to unite the many German states into a consolidated entity 统一实体 are now called "negative integration" 消极整合 -- that is building a community or nation by finding enemies or targeting certain categories of individuals to be outcasts 被排斥者. +

Negative integration is opposed to 与…相反 positive integration 积极整合 based on acts like sharing values 共享价值观 and building consensus 达成共识 among citizens. +

In the 1870s, Bismarck chose to harass 骚扰, disadvantage 使处于不利地位 and insult 侮辱 Catholics 天主教徒, with the idea of turning citizens against 使公民反对 them and uniting Germany in opposition to Catholicism 天主教. +

The cluster of policies 一系列政策 against Catholics was called the Kulturkampf 文化斗争 and eventually Bismarck abandoned 放弃 it because of the outrage 愤怒 among all Germans, including Protestants 新教徒, at the idea of upending 颠覆 religious toleration 宗教宽容 and making fellow citizens outcasts. +

Next Bismarck targeted 针对 workers, especially Social Democrats AKA 又名 socialists 社会主义者. +

Social Democrats were increasing their numbers in elections 选举; and also there were two assassination attempts 暗杀企图 on William I's life which Bismarck used an excuse for 以…为借口 outlawing 取缔 the Social Democratic party 社会民主党. +

Obviously, it's very important to understand how negative integration works, and how the systematic dehumanization 系统性非人化 of an other to unite a country can become not just problematic 有问题的, but indeed catastrophic 灾难性的. +

And I want to be clear that Bismarck didn't invent negative integration or anything, but he did use it. +

He also put into effect 实施 the first social welfare program 社会福利计划 in the West, which included accident and sickness protection 工伤和疾病保障 for workers and also unemployment benefits 失业救济金, which were crucial 至关重要的, because beginning in 1873, Europe (and the world) experienced an economic downturn 经济衰退 that started in industry 工业, not in agriculture 农业 as had been the case in the past. +

In a letter to his wife, Bismarck had called Prussia's defeat of France "a great event in world history." +

And so it was. +

As in Italy (and some would say the United States), victories of professional armies 专业军队的胜利 had created unified nations 统一国家. +

And its important to understand that nations were not inevitable 不可避免的 or natural forms 自然形成的. +

Some were built on creating shared beliefs in constitutions 宪法, or a common culture 共同文化 or having the same "blood." +

In others, negative integration was key to nation-building 国家构建, as countries identified themselves in opposition to 反对 others or by clearly defining 明确界定 what they weren't. +

In Germany the aristocratic 贵族的, landowning officer corps 军官阶层 became "demi-gods" 半神 to the citizenry 公民 that believed in them and in military might 军事力量, while industrialists 工业家 and economic innovators 经济创新者 fell behind in political influence 政治影响力. +

And when you think about your own communities, whether that's a nation-state 民族国家 or a fandom 粉丝群体, I think it's interesting to consider primarily by what you share or by what you are, or are defined primarily by what you are not, or what you are opposed to 反对. +

We'll see how the many ingredients 要素 of nation building 国家构建 evolved 演变, in ways both promising 有希望的 and terrifying 可怕的, as Crash Course heads toward the twentieth century. +

Thanks for watching. +

== 中文翻译
大家好，我是约翰·格林，这里是《速成欧洲史》。 +

所以，如果你看看如今的欧洲，你会注意到欧盟（European Union）最大的两个经济体——意大利（Italy）和德国（Germany）——在我们前面的26集内容所涵盖的时期里，还没有以统一的王国或主权国家的形式存在过。 +

我们往往认为欧洲的民族国家是一成不变且长期存在的，但我的一位曾祖父出生时，意大利还没有成为一个统一的国家。 +

我知道我年纪大了，但还没那么老。 +

什么？ +

哦，我们的剧本监制祖莱哈（Zulaiha）告诉我，我就是那么老。 +

无论如何，我们对这些民族身份的所有刻板印象——比如意大利人说话用手势，德国人拥有极其准时的公共交通——其实都是相当新的概念，因为在1850年，大多数意大利人不会称自己为 “意大利人”。 +

他们会称自己为热那亚人（Genoese），或者西西里人（Sicilian），或者维罗纳人（Veronese）。 +

革命后的欧洲进入了一个剧烈的国家构建时期，最终为20世纪的民族主义狂热奠定了基础。 +

但在我们点燃民族主义热情之前，我们还需要建立更多的国家。 +

[开场介绍] +

第一位具有变革性的国家构建者是拿破仑三世（Napoleon III，拿破仑·波拿巴（Napoleon Bonaparte）的侄子），他在1851年12月2日宣布自己为皇帝——正好是他叔叔做出同样举动的48年后的同一天。 +

他着手建立一个奢华的宫廷，促进经济发展，创建银行，修建铁路，并且在其他方面推动法国（France）的现代化。 +

在政治上，他设立了一个橡皮图章式的立法机构，这意味着他们大多只是为了附和他而存在。 +

他还取缔了工人的激进活动。 +

拿破仑三世的惯用手段是战争，这也是19世纪中期许多国家构建者的做法。 +

他帮助挑起了克里米亚战争（Crimean War），一场短暂、悲惨，尤其是伤亡惨重的战争。 +

在这场战争中，法国、英国（Britain）和奥斯曼帝国（Ottoman Empire）与一直在亚洲对英国构成挑战的俄罗斯（Russia）作战。 +

拿破仑三世的特别高明之处在于，他让奥地利（Austria）没有去援助俄罗斯，而是保持中立。 +

这打破了为稳定欧洲而建立的俄罗斯、普鲁士（Prussia）和奥地利的神圣同盟（Holy Alliance）。 +

俄罗斯在战争中的失败确保了它不会像1848年那样帮助镇压革命了。 +

相反，俄罗斯因自身军事和其他方面的缺陷而陷入困境。 +

到了19世纪60年代，沙皇（tsar）认识到需要解放农奴（serfs）、改革军队，并建立现代司法程序，以挽救其专制制度。 +

或者至少再维持50年。 +

让我们进入“思想泡泡”环节。 +

1. 拿破仑三世利用克里米亚战争后的和平时期，将巴黎（Paris）改造成了一个现代化的世界之都。 +
2. 在南方，加富尔伯爵（Camillo di Cavour）致力于创建一个统一的意大利国家。 +
3. 和拿破仑一样，他是一位经济现代化推动者，他成立了轮船公司，进行农业试验，并四处游历，了解最新的现代化项目。 +
4. 加富尔成为了皮埃蒙特-撒丁王国（Piedmont-Sardinia）国王的首相，国王允许他推进自己的现代化计划。 +
5. 拿破仑三世看到了支持加富尔的好处，所以他签署协议，成为了击败控制意大利北部的奥地利的盟友。 +
6. 拿破仑的想法是，皮埃蒙特将获得奥地利在意大利北部的领土，拿破仑将得到中部地区，而教皇将统治某种意大利邦联（Italian confederation）。 +
7. 于是，根据这个计划，1859年，皮埃蒙特激怒奥地利，使其宣战，并迅速取得了胜利。 +
8. 但加富尔和他的军队在胜利中表现得太出色了，意大利人都团结在他身后， +
9. 并且表示，我们觉得我们想成为意大利人，而不是法国人，从而挫败了拿破仑的计划。 +
10. 1860年，革命者和民主主义者朱塞佩·加里波第（Giuseppe Garibaldi）召集了一千名志愿者——大多是青少年——给他们穿上红衫， +
11. 然后乘船前往西西里岛，那里反对贵族地主（aristocratic landlords）的起义已经在进行中。 +
12. 他计划为统一的意大利夺取南方。 +
13. 1860年，他和他的部队成功做到了这一点， +
14. 然后他们向北进军，与皮埃蒙特的军队会合。 +
15. 1861年，意大利王国（kingdom of Italy）宣告成立。 +

感谢“思想泡泡”！ +

所以这里有必要稍作停顿。 +

为什么加里波第，一位支持共和制的、充满浪漫主义色彩的领袖，会为像皮埃蒙特国王这样的君主效力呢？ +

为什么加富尔，一位现代化推动者和君主制国家的首相，会与加里波第这样的人合作呢？ +

嗯，到了19世纪50年代，关于国家统一和人民统治的浪漫梦想，让位于所谓的 “现实政治”（realpolitik），或者说是权力政治，又或者说是政治现实主义。 +

那种发自内心的断言，即政治行为是上帝的意志，或者这些行为代表国家实现了某种神圣或浪漫的命运，已经不复存在了。 +

人们认为，最好是现实一些，把事情做成。 +

德国政治家奥托·冯·俾斯麦（Otto von Bismarck）最能体现现实政治，他说：“德国所看重的不是普鲁士的自由主义……当今的重大问题不是通过演说和多数人的决议就能解决的……而是要靠铁和血。” +

俾斯麦成为了现实政治最成功的践行者之一，并在此过程中创建了现代德意志帝国（German empire）。 +

俾斯麦年轻时，他的生活几乎没有什么严肃的目标。 +

我年轻时也有过那样的阶段。 +

俾斯麦出身富裕的容克地主阶级（Junker，即拥有土地的贵族），在大学时，他是个爱狂欢作乐、酗酒的人，总的来说就是个粗人。 +

天哪，这可太熟悉了。 +

他欠下了很多债务，以至于他放弃了公务员的职业，回家帮忙经营家族农场。 +

好吧。 +

终于我们的人生轨迹开始不同了。 +

我想它们还会变得更加不同，因为可以说他是19世纪下半叶最重要的欧洲政治家，而我……你懂的。 +

另一方面，我可从来没有挑起过一场战争！ +

俾斯麦在遇到并娶了约翰娜·普特卡默（Johanna Puttkammer）后，生活变得严肃起来。约翰娜是一位虔诚的路德教徒（Lutheran），她为俾斯麦提供了一个更安宁的家庭生活，以平衡他后来所投身的政治动荡。 +

他的最终抱负是摆脱庄园管理工作，成为德国和国际政治舞台上的重要人物，但我认识很多喝得烂醉、负债累累的派对爱好者，他们也都有远大的梦想。 +

俾斯麦之所以令人惊叹，在于他的成功程度。 +

他作为普鲁士派往德意志各邦议会的代表，然后又作为驻俄罗斯大使，重新回到了政治舞台。 +

通过这些角色，坚定的君主主义者俾斯麦学到了关于外交、国际事务，以及经济自由主义者及其宪法价值观的经验教训。 +

他并非从根本上反对宪法，也不反对经济进步。 +

他最首要的是支持普鲁士国王威廉一世（Prussian King William I）。 +

所以，我们不应该把俾斯麦看作是强烈反对这样或那样的改革，而应该看作是强烈支持在国王领导下实现德国的统一。 +

1862年，威廉一世和一些自由主义者一样，希望进行军队改革和现代化，但威廉一世在某些其他条款上拒绝让步，尤其是新兵的三年服役期。 +

俾斯麦也承诺不让步，然后他直接按照国王的改革方案行事，完全绕过议会，只是按照国王的意愿征税和支出。 +

这一行为以及其他许多行为，让俾斯麦树敌众多，部分原因是他专横的行事风格，但他仍然得到了最重要的那个人的支持——普鲁士国王。 +

所以，几十年来，尤其是在1848年之后的大环境下，一个主要问题是：谁将领导德意志人——是奥地利还是普鲁士？ +

忠诚地为威廉一世国王效力，是俾斯麦推动普鲁士成为德意志主导力量的关键。 +

有时人们认为俾斯麦就像一个无所不知的有远见者，他精心策划着代表普鲁士所采取的每一步行动……但历史学家现在大多认为，俾斯麦的政治举措并非是某种预先计划好的、像四维象棋那样的策略，用来战胜奥地利；相反，他只是有着出色的即兴发挥的天赋。 +

例如，1864年，他与奥地利结盟，以解决两个有争议的省份——石勒苏益格（Schleswig）和荷尔斯泰因（Holstein）的归属问题。 +

所以，俾斯麦说服奥地利与普鲁士一起对丹麦（Denmark）开战，以解决对石勒苏益格-荷尔斯泰因的有争议的统治权问题。 +

他们的胜利使普鲁士获得了石勒苏益格的管辖权，奥地利得到了荷尔斯泰因。 +

两年后，普鲁士和奥地利再次开战，这次是为了同样的两个省份而相互对抗。 +

普奥战争（Austro-Prussian war）只持续了六个多星期，这要归功于普鲁士前面提到的对军队职业化和现代化的坚持。 +

所以这整个事件都被俾斯麦巧妙地处理了：首先，让你的敌人奥地利帮你打败你的另一个敌人丹麦，然后打败奥地利，接着，恭喜你，你得到了石勒苏益格-荷尔斯泰因，这名字听起来就像一种疾病。 +

但这很可能不是事先计划好的。 +

世界的中心刚刚打开了吗？ +

里面有魔法8号球（magic 8 ball）吗？ +

好吧，魔法8号球，欧盟会一切顺利吗？ +

肯定会的！ +

历史的有趣之处在于，它总是让人觉得是必然的，因为，你知道，它已经发生了。 +

所以当我们现在回顾过去的俾斯麦和德国的统一时，一切看起来都极具战略性。 +

但我认为，在多元宇宙中，有很多个世界，在那里事情不会像在我们这个世界里这样发展。 +

历史就是已经发生的事情，我们都在共同创造历史，就像俾斯麦和19世纪欧洲的其他人一样。 +

但让我们回到俾斯麦…… +

所以，在取得重大胜利后，普鲁士国王威廉想继续进军，占领维也纳（Vienna），甚至可能还有匈牙利（Hungary），但俾斯麦凭借他在国际事务中一贯的敏锐洞察力，劝国王撤军并巩固战果，因为普鲁士现在已经是德意志的主导国家了。 +

俾斯麦把北德意志各王国和邦国纳入了北德意志邦联（North German Confederation），同时还试图把那些仍然抵制加入普鲁士的德意志邦国也吸纳进来。 +

而他做到这一点的方式在某种黑暗的权谋艺术方面，还挺高明的。 +

俾斯麦深刻理解像报纸这样的大众市场媒体日益增长的力量，并且他知道如何向它们散布谣言。 +

例如，在谁将登上小小的卢森堡（Luxembourg）王位的问题上存在一场争斗——候选人一方是与普鲁士结盟的人，另一方是与拿破仑三世结盟的人。 +

随着竞争日益激烈，俾斯麦让报纸刊登了他的一句个人言论，大意是说法国人 “并非像人们通常认为的那样是优秀的民族”，实际上他们是 “爱说大话” 的人，沉迷于 “大胆、暴力的行为”。 +

与此同时，他还篡改了一封普鲁士国王发出的电报，使其看起来像是对法国人的侮辱。 +

然后在1870年8月，法国国民议会（French National Assembly）对这些言论感到愤怒，宣布开战。 +

法国人被轻易击败，拿破仑三世和一支15万人的军队在9月2日被俘。 +

巴伐利亚人（Bavarians）以及一些较小的邦国不得不加入普鲁士。 +

1871年1月，德意志帝国（German Empire）在凡尔赛宫（Versailles palace）的镜厅宣告成立，而这一切都是因为卢森堡。 +

尽管此时之前对俾斯麦的许多反对声已经减弱，但他仍然必须把这些不同的邦国凝聚成一个国家——一个拥有自己的制度和文化的国家。 +

这是一项充满挑战的任务，他以自己独特的风格来完成：与其说是稳扎稳打，不如说是带有实验性。 +

俾斯麦将众多德意志邦国统一成一个实体的具体举措，现在被称为 “消极整合”（negative integration）——也就是说，通过寻找敌人，或者针对某些特定类别的个人，将他们排斥在外，来建立一个共同体或国家。 +

消极整合与基于诸如共享价值观和在公民中达成共识等行为的 “积极整合”（positive integration）相对立。 +

在19世纪70年代，俾斯麦选择骚扰、打压和侮辱天主教徒（Catholics），目的是让公民反对他们，并让德国在反对天主教的旗帜下团结起来。 +

这一系列针对天主教徒的政策被称为 “文化斗争”（Kulturkampf），最终俾斯麦放弃了这一政策，因为包括新教徒（Protestants）在内的所有德国人，都对破坏宗教宽容、把同胞视为被排斥者的做法感到愤怒。 +

接下来，俾斯麦的目标是工人，尤其是社会民主党人（Social Democrats），也就是社会主义者（socialists）。 +

社会民主党人在选举中的人数不断增加；而且还发生了两起刺杀威廉一世的未遂事件，俾斯麦以此为借口取缔了社会民主党（Social Democratic party）。 +

显然，理解消极整合是如何运作的，以及为了团结一个国家而对 “他者” 进行系统性的非人化处理，不仅会产生问题，而且确实可能带来灾难性后果，这是非常重要的。 +

我想明确一点，俾斯麦并没有发明消极整合之类的东西，但他确实使用了这种手段。 +

他还实施了西方第一个社会福利项目，其中包括为工人提供工伤和疾病保障，以及失业救济金，这些措施至关重要，因为从1873年开始，欧洲（以及全世界）经历了一场经济衰退，这次衰退始于工业领域，而不像过去那样始于农业领域。 +

俾斯麦在给妻子的一封信中，称普鲁士对法国的胜利是 “世界历史上的一件大事”。 +

事实确实如此。 +

就像在意大利（而且有些人会说在美国也是如此）一样，专业军队的胜利造就了统一的国家。 +

重要的是要明白，国家并非是必然或自然形成的形式。 +

有些国家是建立在对宪法的共同信仰、共同文化，或者拥有相同 “血统” 的基础上。 +

Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

So if you look at Europe today, you'll note that two of the European Union's largest economies -- Italy and Germany -- have not existed as unified kingdoms or sovereign states during our first 26 episodes.

We tend to think of Europe's nation states as static and longstanding, but one of my great grandfathers was born before Italy became a unified country.

Now, I know that I'm old, but I'm not that old.

What's that?

Oh, our script supervisor Zulaiha informs me that I am that old.

At any rate, all the stereotypes we have of these national identities -- that Italians talk with their hands, that Germans have extremely punctual public transport -- are quite new, because in 1850, most Italians wouldn't have called themselves "Italians."

They would've been Genoese, or Sicilian, or Veronese.

The post-revolutionary European world became one of dramatic nation-building that ultimately set the stage for 20th century nationalistic fervor.

But before we can get nationalist passions riled up, we need to make some more nations.

[Intro]

The first of the disruptive nation-builders was Napoleon III (Napoleon Bonaparte's nephew), who on December 2, 1851 declared himself emperor -- 48 years to the day after his uncle had done the same.

He set out to create a lavish court, boost the economy, create banks, build railroads, and otherwise modernize France.

Politically, he set up a rubber-stamp legislature, meaning that mostly they just existed to agree with him.

He also outlawed worker activism.

Napoleon III's modus operandi was war, as it would be for many of the nation-builders of the mid 19th-century.

He helped provoke the Crimean War, a short, miserable, and especially deadly war.

In it, France, Britain, and the Ottoman Empire fought Russia, which had been challenging Britain across Asia.

And the special genius of Napoleon III was to get Austria to not come to the aid of Russia and instead to remain neutral.

This cracked the Holy Alliance of Russia, Prussia, and Austria that had been set up to stabilize Europe.

And Russia's defeat in the war ensured that it would not help squash revolution as it had in 1848.

Instead, Russia reeled from its military and other shortcomings.

By the 1860s, the tsar recognized the need to free the serfs, reform the military, and set up modern judicial procedures in order to save its autocratic system.

Or to save it for another 50 years anyway.

Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

1. Napoleon III used the peace after the Crimean War to remake Paris into a modern world capital.
2. And to the south, Camillo di Cavour aimed to create a unified Italian state.
3. Like Napoleon, he was an economic modernizer who set up steamship companies, experimented in agriculture, and traveled to see the latest in modernization projects.
4. Cavour became prime minister for the king of Piedmont-Sardinia, who allowed him to move forward with his modernization plans.
5. Napoleon III saw advantages in supporting Cavour, so he signed on as an ally in defeating Austria, which controlled northern Italy.
6. Napoleon's idea was that Piedmont would get Austria's territory in northern Italy, Napoleon would get the center, and the pope would rule kind of an Italian confederation.
7. So, in accordance with this plan, in 1859, Piedmont provoked Austria into declaring war and gained quick victories.
8. But Cavour and his army looked so good in victory that Italians rallied behind him,
9. and were like, I think we want to be Italian and not French, thus thwarting Napoleon's plans.
10. In 1860, the revolutionary and democrat Giuseppe Garibaldi gathered up a thousand volunteers -- mostly teenagers -- clad them in red shirts,
11. and headed by ship to Sicily, where revolts against aristocratic landlords were already underway.
12. He planned to capture the south for a united Italy.
13. And in 1860, he and his forces succeeded in doing so,
14. then they moved northward to unite with the forces of Piedmont.
15. And in 1861, the kingdom of Italy was declared.

Thanks Thought Bubble.

So a small pause is necessary here.

Why is Garibaldi, a pro-republic, romantic leader, working on behalf of a monarch like the king of Piedmont?

Why is Cavour, the modernizer and prime minister of a monarchy, joining the likes of Garibaldi?

Well, by the 1850s, romantic dreams of national unification and the rule of the people gave way to what is known as realpolitik or power politics or realism in politics.

Gone were the heartfelt assertions that political actions were the will of God or that they achieved some divine or romantic destiny on behalf of the nation.

Better, it was argued, to be realistic and get things done.

German politician Otto von Bismarck expressed realpolitik best when he said "Germany looks not to Prussia's liberalism... The great questions of the day will not be settled by speeches and majority decisions... but by blood and iron."

Bismarck became one of the most successful practitioners of realpolitik and in the process created the modern German empire.

As a young adult, Bismarck's life had virtually no seriousness of purpose.

I had one of those young adulthoods as well.

Born a well-to-do landed aristocrat or Junker, he was a carouser, imbiber, and generally a lout as a university student.

Boy, this is familiar.

He built up so many debts that he gave up a career in the civil service to return home and help run the family farms.

All right.

Finally our lives are diverging.

And I guess they're about to diverge further, since he was arguably the most important European politician of the second half of the nineteenth century, and I'm...you know.

On the other hand, I've never started a war!

Bismarck's life got more serious after he met and married Johanna Puttkammer, a devout Lutheran, who gave him a more peaceful home life to balance the political turmoil that he came to embrace.

His ultimate ambition was to leave estate management and become a major player in German and international politics, but I've known a lot of drunken heavily indebted partiers, and they all have big dreams.

What makes Bismarck so astonishing is the extent to which he succeeded.

He made his return to the political scene as Prussia's delegate to assemblies of the German states and then as ambassador to Russia.

And through these roles, the staunchly monarchist Bismarck learned lessons about diplomacy, and international affairs, and about economic liberals and their constitutional values.

He came not to oppose a constitution per se nor to oppose economic progress.

What he did above all else was support Prussian King William I.

So we shouldn't see Bismarck so much as opposed to this or that kind of reform so much as strongly in favor of a unified Germany under the leadership of a king.

In 1862 William I wanted army reform and modernization as did some liberals, but William refused to budge on certain other provisions, especially a three-year term for recruits.

And Bismarck promised not to budge either and then he went ahead with the king's version of reform, bypassing the parliament altogether by simply collecting taxes and dispensing them as the king wanted.

This among many other actions made Bismarck enemies of all kinds, partly because of his bullying manner, but he continued to be supported by the one person who counted -- the Prussian king.

So, for several decades, but most pressingly in the post-1848 atmosphere, a major question was who would lead the Germans -- Austria or Prussia.

Serving King William I loyally was Bismarck's key to promoting Prussia as the dominant power for Germans.

Sometimes people interpret Bismarck as like, an all-seeing visionary who carefully plotted every step he took on behalf of Prussia... But historians have now mostly come to believe that Bismarck's political moves were not part of some pre-planned game of 4D chess to outmaneuver Austria; instead, he just had a wonderful gift for improvisation.

For example, in 1864, he made an alliance with Austria to settle the status of two contested provinces -- Schleswig and Holstein.

So, Bismarck persuaded Austria to join Prussia in war against Denmark to resolve the contested rule of Schleswig-Holstein.

Their victory gave Prussia administration of Schleswig and Austria got Holstein.

Two years later, Prussia and Austria went to war again, this time with each other over the same two provinces.

The Austro-Prussian war lasted just over six weeks, thanks to Prussia's aforementioned commitment to the professionalism and modernization of its army.

So this whole affair was masterfully handled by Bismarck; first, get your enemy Austria to help you defeat your other enemy Denmark, then defeat Austria and boom, congratulations, you've got Schleswig Holstein, which only sounds like a disease.

But it likely wasn't planned that way.

Did the center of the world just open?

Is there a magic 8 ball in there?

All right magic 8 ball, is the European Union going to hold up OK?

It is certain!

The thing about history is that it always feels certain because, you know, it already happened.

So when we in the present look at Bismarck in the past and the unification of Germany, it all feels, like, extraordinarily strategic.

But I would argue that, in the multiverse, there's a bunch of worlds where it doesn't work out the way it worked out for us.

History is what happens to have happened, and we are all making that together, just as Bismarck and everyone else in nineteenth century Europe was making it.

But back to Bismarck...

So, following the big victory, Prussia's King William wanted to keep going, to capture Vienna and maybe even Hungary, but Bismarck, with his usual astuteness in international affairs, encouraged the king to pull back and consolidate, as Prussia was now the leading German nation.

Bismarck had drawn the northern German kingdoms and states into the North German Confederation, while also aiming to draw in the German states that were still resisting joining Prussia.

And how he did this was kind of brilliant in a dark artsy sort of way.

Bismarck deeply understood the growing power of mass market media like newspapers, and he knew how to feed rumors to them.

For instance, there was a battle over who would take the throne of tiny Luxembourg -- someone allied with Prussia, or someone allied with Napoleon III.

As the contest heated up, Bismarck got a personal quote in the papers to the effect that the French were "not the fine people they are usually considered to be," and were in fact "loudmouthed" people given over to "bold, violent behavior."

Meanwhile, he also doctored a telegram sent from the Prussian king to make it appear insulting to the French.

And then in August 1870, the French National Assembly, outraged at these characterizations, declared war.

The French were handily defeated, with Napoleon III and an army of 150,000 people captured on September 2.

The Bavarians along with smaller states had had to join Prussia.

And in January 1871, the German Empire was declared in the Hall of Mirrors of the Versailles palace, and all because of Luxembourg.

Although much of the earlier opposition to Bismarck died down at this point, he still had to forge a nation from these disparate states -- one with its own institutions and its own culture.

This was a fraught task, which he did in his signature style: more experimentally than surefootedly.

Bismarck's specific moves to unite the many German states into a consolidated entity are now called "negative integration" -- that is building a community or nation by finding enemies or targeting certain categories of individuals to be outcasts.

Negative integration is opposed to positive integration based on acts like sharing values and building consensus among citizens.

In the 1870s, Bismarck chose to harass, disadvantage and insult Catholics, with the idea of turning citizens against them and uniting Germany in opposition to Catholicism.

The cluster of policies against Catholics was called the Kulturkampf and eventually Bismarck abandoned it because of the outrage among all Germans, including Protestants, at the idea of upending religious toleration and making fellow citizens outcasts.

Next Bismarck targeted workers, especially Social Democrats AKA socialists.

Social Democrats were increasing their numbers in elections; and also there were two assassination attempts on William I's life which Bismarck used an excuse for outlawing the Social Democratic party.

Obviously, it's very important to understand how negative integration works, and how the systematic dehumanization of an other to unite a country can become not just problematic, but indeed catastrophic.

And I want to be clear that Bismarck didn't invent negative integration or anything, but he did use it.

He also put into effect the first social welfare program in the West, which included accident and sickness protection for workers and also unemployment benefits, which were crucial, because beginning in 1873, Europe (and the world) experienced an economic downturn that started in industry, not in agriculture as had been the case in the past.

In a letter to his wife, Bismarck had called Prussia's defeat of France "a great event in world history."

And so it was.

As in Italy (and some would say the United States), victories of professional armies had created unified nations.

And its important to understand that nations were not inevitable or natural forms.

Some were built on creating shared beliefs in constitutions, or a common culture or having the same "blood."

In others, negative integration was key to nation-building, as countries identified themselves in opposition to others or by clearly defining what they weren't.

In Germany the aristocratic, landowning officer corps became "demi-gods" to the citizenry that believed in them and in military might, while industrialists and economic innovators fell behind in political influence.

And when you think about your own communities, whether that's a nation-state or a fandom, I think it's interesting to consider primarily by what you share or by what you are, or are defined primarily by what you are not, or what you are opposed to.

We'll see how the many ingredients of nation building evolved, in ways both promising and terrifying, as Crash Course heads toward the twentieth century.

Thanks for watching.

I'll see you next time.
