Hi, I’m John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

So, last week we discussed the Enlightenment 启蒙运动 philosophers 哲学家 who challenged 挑战；质疑 the idea that kings and nobles were qualified 有资格的 to be elites 精英 simply because of the families into which they were born.

But still, monarchs 君主 were also interested in Enlightenment ideals 理想, and also understood they needed to effectively 有效地 adapt to 适应 the Enlightenment, as they had adapted to previous changes in theology 神学 and philosophy 哲学.

For instance, Catherine II (or Catherine “the Great”) of Russia corresponded 通信 often and enthusiastically 热情地 with Voltaire, even though he criticized despotic 专制的；暴虐的 rule. And she also offered to print Diderot’s Encyclopedia 百科全书 in Russia when France censored 审查；查禁 it.

We use the term “Enlightened Monarchs 开明君主” to refer to 指的是 the rulers who supported and applauded 称赞；赞赏 Enlightenment thinkers. But were they in fact Enlightened 开明的, or did they remain absolutist 专制主义的 despots 专制君主？The answer will surprise you, unless you have even a passing familiarity with 对…略知一二 despots.

[Intro]

First, let’s review what the philosophes （18世纪法国）启蒙思想家 criticized in the practices of rulers and aristocratic 贵族的 leaders. They singled out 挑出；选出 torture 酷刑, censorship 审查制度, and their arrogance 傲慢 and capriciousness 反复无常；任性. Like, kings and their nobility 贵族 could have ordinary people thrown into prison for just about any reason—large or small. And in general, most of the Enlightenment thinkers believed that nobles, and the system that supported them, were despotic 专制的 from top to bottom 从上到下.

French theorist 理论家 Montesquieu, whom we met in the previous episode as the author of the satiric 讽刺性的 Persian Letters 《波斯人信札》, also published The Spirit of Laws 《论法的精神》in 1748. In it, he discussed customs 风俗 and types of government as they were influenced by climate 气候, and topography 地形；地势, and other variables 变量.

To him, there was no God-given standard of divine right 神权 rule. Instead, Montesquieu focused on three basic types of government: democracies 民主国家, suitable for 适合 very small states; monarchies 君主制国家 that ruled mid-sized kingdoms 中等规模的王国; and despotic states 专制国家 such as empires 帝国 that were governed with an iron hand 严厉地；铁腕手段.

Voltaire and other philosophes elaborated on 详细阐述；详尽说明 these theories: and many preferred Britain’s post-Glorious Revolution 光荣革命后 type of law-based monarchy 君主立宪制, where courts 法院 and a parliament 议会 were separate from 与…分离 the monarch’s power and a Bill of Rights 权利法案 ensured 确保 certain protections to citizens 公民.

All of this—the enshrining 铭记；珍视 of rights, independent courts 独立法院, parliamentary representation 议会代表制—meant that power was balanced 平衡 among multiple institutions 机构. Also, the multiplicity 多样性 of religions in Britain was seen as another assurance 保障；保证; it prevented a despotic religious institution 机构 from gaining control of 控制 the government.

Now, we’ve seen from examples like Poland-Lithuania that distributed power 权力分散 and diversity of belief 信仰多样性 sometimes means internal conflict 内部冲突 and political gridlock 政治僵局 that weakens a state, but in Britain, Enlightenment philosophers saw an example of a state that was strong without being despotic 专制的.

And in part because they had an example to point to 指出；指明, the Enlightenment philosophers were difficult for those in the upper echelons 阶层 of government and society to ignore 忽视. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

1. King Frederick the Great of Prussia 普鲁士 was renowned for 因…而闻名 his love of refinement 高雅；精致 and his interest in music and design.
2. Like his friend Voltaire, Frederick the Great collected Chinese porcelain 瓷器.
3. He also wrote an opera 歌剧 about the Aztec emperor Monteczuma.
4. which praised Monteczuma for religious toleration 宽容；容忍.
5. and seemed to agree with Enlightenment activists 活动家 who fought against religious bigotry 偏执；顽固 and torture 酷刑.
6. And Frederick also welcomed religious exiles 流亡者 from less tolerant regimes 政权 as a way of building the Prussian population.
7. —again a policy in line with 与…一致 Enlightenment. He called himself “a servant of the people.”
8. But all that said, Frederick built a massive 庞大的 standing army 常备军.
9. increasing the armed forces 武装力量 to 200,000 men from his father’s army of 80,000ish.
10. And he also forced the aristocracy 贵族 to serve the state.
11. either in the army or in the administration 管理；行政 of the kingdom 王国.
12. And while like a good Enlightenment thinker he lightened 减轻 the burden 负担 of serfs 农奴 working his own estates 庄园.
13. he also rewarded 奖励 loyal aristocrats by increasing their control over the serfs living in their territories 领地.
14. further disenfranchising 剥夺…的权利 the most vulnerable 脆弱的；易受伤害的 of his subjects 臣民.
15. These increasingly empowered 被赋予权力的 landed aristocrats 地主贵族, or Junkers 容克（德国贵族地主阶级）to use the German term, that Frederick rewarded.
16. were the very type that Voltaire and other philosophes lambasted 严厉批评 in their writings for the aristocrats’ pride 傲慢 and highhandedness 专横；高压手段.
17. Frederick even blocked 阻止 talented commoners 平民 from achieving high positions in either the bureaucracy 官僚机构 or the army.
18. entrenching 巩固；使根深蒂固 aristocratic power still further.

Thanks, Thought Bubble. At any rate 无论如何, as a result of the supposedly 据说 enlightened Frederick the Great’s policies, men of aristocratic pedigree 血统 in Prussia continued to have a major say in 对…有重要发言权 politics and the army into World War I and even beyond.

And then there was another of Voltaire’s friends, the aforementioned 前面提到的 Catherine the Great of Russia. For someone who disliked absolutism 专制主义, Voltaire sure was pals with 和…是朋友 a lot of absolutists 专制主义者.

As Czar 沙皇, Catherine sought to 试图 create standardized 标准化的 codes of laws and regulations 法规, which had an Enlightenment-ish tinge 些许…的味道, but was mostly an attempt to ease 缓解 the struggle between all the groups that wanted to shape royal policy 制定皇家政策 like how new monarchs were selected 挑选.

The people who fought over these decisions included clans 家族, factions 派别 of the Royal Guard 皇家卫队, groups of influential clergy 有影响力的神职人员, and cliques 小团体 among commercial traders 商业贸易者 and ordinary citizens.

So, Catherine summoned 召集 representatives from all social groups for their input 意见；建议.

And she found that each only thought about bettering 改善 their own privileges 特权 or lot in life—the serfs seemed to have the most need for help, while merchants wanted the right to own serfs, and the nobility wanted more of everything.

Ultimately 最终, Catherine failed in getting representatives to think first and foremost 首先 of the needs of the empire as a whole.

Now, like other enlightened monarchs, her policies did aim to be rational 理性的, but this was especially true when it came to 当谈到 consolidating 巩固 state power, which of course benefited her office 职位.

So one could argue she was also focused on her interests over those of the empire, but, like other enlightened monarchs and like Peter the Great before her, Catherine did emphasize 强调 education. She even founded 创办 schools for girls, who were generally seen as not needing an education. The empress 女皇 also created the first Russian dictionary and appointed 任命 a woman to head the project.

She undertook 承担；从事 the building of roads and the fostering 促进；培养 of trade to bring economic unity 经济统一 to Russia.

But, like some other Enlightened monarchs, Catherine also boosted 提高；增强 the importance of the aristocracy and she consolidated 巩固 their privileges.

She professed 声称 to want to improve the status 地位 of the serf population, again bowing to 屈服；顺从 the philosophes’ humanitarian 人道主义的 concerns, while imposing 征收 taxes that affected ordinary people the most.

Most of these monarchs wanted a more streamlined 精简的 and efficient 高效的 royal administration 皇家行政机构, but not necessarily for philosophical 哲学的 reasons.

They benefited from well run armies, and they really benefited from taxes. During this age of ever-improving weaponry 武器装备 and higher costs for larger standing armies, taxes needed to be increased and also collected more efficiently.

In other words, governments needed to operate rationally—not according to the whims 心血来潮；突发奇想 of fate or individuals, but according to the needs of the state.

In 1770, for instance, Habsburg empress 女皇 Maria Theresa, who despite that portrait was not twin sisters with Catherine the Great, deployed 派遣 soldiers to renumber 重新编号 the addresses of urban housing and standardize 使标准化 them across culturally diverse groups who didn’t even speak the same language.

The soldiers were told to count the empire’s subjects but also to listen to their individual reports on health and well-being. And this self-reporting served to unify 使联合；使统一 the empire’s wide-range of inhabitants by showing that the state cared enough to count them and ask them about their needs—that might seem minor 次要的；不重要的 today, but consider being an 18th century peasant 农民 who rarely if ever had meaningful 有意义的 contact with the imperial government.

Toleration 宽容；容忍 was an Enlightenment ideal 理想 that also served to increase the number of useful citizens in an empire. Like when Maria Theresa’s successor 继任者 Joseph II of Austria announced the emancipation 解放 of the Jews in the Habsburg Empire during his administration, he decreed 颁布；命令 that Jews could not use their own language except in religious services. Which was a way to better integrate 使融入 them into the imperial workforce, but the decree 法令 also said, “there must be an end to the prejudice 偏见 and contempt 轻视 which some subjects, particularly the unintelligent, have shown towards the Jewish nation.” The decree also noted the “deplorable 应受谴责的” and even “criminal behavior 犯罪行为” towards Jews and called for it to end as a way of strengthening the empire.[1]

Joseph II, was probably, like, the most actually enlightened of the enlightenment monarchs, also struck at 打击 ancient ideas in other ways, like by diminishing 减少；削弱 the grip 控制；影响力 of the aristocracy on serfs.

He encouraged agricultural experimentation 实验, including the creation of a freer agricultural work force 劳动力. So, under his reforms, serfs no longer owed personal service to aristocrats, whose lands they worked, and they could even leave an estate to work as an artisan 工匠 or in trade.

“I have made philosophy the lawmaker 立法者 of my empire,” Joseph claimed, and in some ways that was true.[2] But the aristocracy rebelled 反抗, and after Joseph’s death, his brother and successor rolled back 撤销；废除 these Enlightenment reforms.

Around the same time that Joseph was ruling Austria, in the French home of Enlightenment, rulers like Louis the XV were also listening to the voices of change and attempting to follow them, but, you know, without losing power. Then as now, everyone wanted change so long as it did not affect them negatively.

So, French rulers tried to reform taxation 税收 and streamline 精简 government by getting rid of 摆脱；去除 the Parlements 高等法院, which blocked the monarchy’s attempts at making taxes a bit more equitable 公平的.

The Parlements registered 登记 royal decrees 法令 and their members could sell their jobs to the highest bidder 出价最高者. Royal advisors were like, I don’t understand why those funds don’t go to the government and they also questioned whether there needed to be a bunch of people whose job was to register royal decrees. But the members of the Parlement managed to rouse 激起 ordinary people with cries of royal tyranny 暴政. So the king eventually backed down 让步；退缩.

Similarly, another reforming minister lifted 取消 tariffs 关税 and regulations on the grain market in the name of 以…的名义 free trade. But the flow of food was interrupted 中断 which caused a huge outburst 爆发 from people. Reform might be good in theory, but when actually enacted 实施, reform often upset 扰乱 social stability 社会稳定 and clashed with 与…冲突 vested interests 既得利益. Good news for lots of people was still bad news for some people. Then as now.

Last but not least were the Spanish, who with their vast 庞大的 empire were especially eager to streamline 精简 government and enhance 增加；提高 revenue 财政收入.

To this end 为此 the royal administration enacted 颁布 policy changes known as the Bourbon reforms 波旁改革, which made governmental administration more effective, especially when it came to collecting taxes.

These reforms also allowed people of Spanish descent 后裔 born in the colonies 殖民地 to rise a bit higher in the colonial bureaucracy 殖民官僚机构 and army, but they were still prevented from reaching the very top echelons 最高阶层, as of course were native people.

Also because the royal administration saw the Catholic Church in the colonies as competing for 争夺 local people’s loyalty 忠诚 and siphoning off 抽走；取走 funds, the administration outlawed 取缔；禁止 the Jesuits 耶稣会会士, alleged 声称 to be at the head of a corrupt 腐败的 and influential 有影响力的 pack of theologians 神学家 who were trying to get people to be loyal to Jesus instead of the Spanish king.

All right, the stained glass window is back, which means it must be time for the conclusion.

Enlightenment thought, which was rich and wide-ranging 广泛的 in possibilities for change, wasn’t universally 普遍地 popular, and all these reforms had their detractors 反对者. At times, urban people objected 反对 as prices rose or as food became scarce 短缺的 because of changes in trade policies.

And in cases where aristocrats were losing command over 失去对…的控制 serfs or having to pay additional taxes, like in the Habsburg monarchy 君主制, aristocrats often protested 抗议 Enlightenment reforms.

Still, life was on average getting a lot better for aristocrats. As the eighteenth century progressed, more of them lived in outsized 巨大的 splendor 奢华；壮丽 that can still impress us today when we visit the many chateaux 城堡 across Europe that remain from the 17th and 18th centuries.

In many cases they had Chinese porcelain, and lots of other luxury goods. They had access to 有机会使用 inexpensive labor 廉价劳动力 that provided them with plenty of food, and also the chance to make huge monuments 纪念碑 to their luxury and privilege 特权.

And despite the massive destruction of twentieth century wars, many of those monuments survive today. But little remains of the rising poverty 贫困 of the 18th century.

That growing poverty occurred alongside 与…同时发生 growing European know-how 专门知识 and productivity 生产力, and the poor saw that the rich were getting richer even as they were often eating bread cut with sawdust 锯末.

As governments consolidated 巩固 their administrations and waged 发动 an almost unbelievable number of wars, the poor would approach a breaking point 临界点. And beginning in France, they would rebel against 反抗 the aristocracy. Changes were coming that not even wily 狡猾的 monarchs could adapt to.

大家好，我是约翰·格林，这里是《速成欧洲史》。

上周，我们讨论了启蒙运动时期的哲学家，他们对国王和贵族仅仅因为出身就有资格成为精英这一观点提出了挑战。

不过，君主们对启蒙运动的理念也很感兴趣，并且他们明白自己需要有效地适应启蒙运动，就像他们曾经适应神学和哲学方面的先前变化一样。

例如，俄罗斯的叶卡捷琳娜二世（Catherine II，又称“叶卡捷琳娜大帝”）经常热情地与伏尔泰通信，尽管伏尔泰批判专制统治。而且，当法国对狄德罗的《百科全书》进行审查时，她还提出在俄罗斯印刷这部著作。

我们用“开明君主”这个词来指代那些支持并赞赏启蒙运动思想家的统治者。但他们实际上真的开明吗？还是说他们仍然是专制暴君呢？答案可能会让你感到惊讶，除非你对暴君哪怕只是稍有了解。

[开场介绍]

首先，让我们回顾一下哲学家们对统治者和贵族领袖的行为所提出的批判。他们特别指出了酷刑、审查制度，以及这些人的傲慢和反复无常。比如说，国王和贵族几乎可以以任何理由，不管是大事还是小事，就把普通人投入监狱。总的来说，大多数启蒙运动思想家认为，贵族以及支持贵族的制度从上到下都是专制的。

法国理论家孟德斯鸠，我们在上一集里知道他是讽刺作品《波斯人信札》的作者，他在1748年还出版了《论法的精神》（The Spirit of Laws）。在这本书中，他讨论了受气候、地形和其他变量影响的习俗和政府类型。

在他看来，不存在上帝赋予的君权神授的标准。相反，孟德斯鸠关注三种基本的政府类型：适合非常小的国家的民主制；统治中等规模王国的君主制；以及像帝国那样用铁腕统治的专制国家。

伏尔泰和其他哲学家对这些理论进行了阐述：许多人更喜欢英国光荣革命后的那种基于法律的君主制，在这种制度下，法院和议会独立于君主的权力，而且《权利法案》确保了对公民的某些保护。

所有这一切——权利的确立、独立的法院、议会代表制——意味着权力在多个机构之间得到了平衡。此外，英国宗教的多样性也被视为另一种保障；它防止了专制的宗教机构控制政府。

现在，从波兰立陶宛联邦这样的例子中我们可以看到，权力分散和信仰的多样性有时意味着内部冲突和政治僵局，这会削弱一个国家，但在英国，启蒙运动哲学家们看到了一个强大而不专制的国家的范例。

部分因为他们有这样一个可以借鉴的例子，政府和社会上层的人很难忽视启蒙运动哲学家们的观点。让我们进入“思想泡泡”环节。
1. 普鲁士（Prussia）的腓特烈大帝（King Frederick the Great）以其对高雅事物的热爱以及对音乐和设计的兴趣而闻名。
2. 就像他的朋友伏尔泰一样，腓特烈大帝收藏中国瓷器。
3. 他还创作了一部关于阿兹特克皇帝蒙特苏马（Montezuma）的歌剧。
4. 这部歌剧赞扬了蒙特苏马的宗教宽容。
5. 并且似乎与那些反对宗教偏执和酷刑的启蒙运动活动家的观点一致。
6. 而且腓特烈还欢迎来自不那么宽容的政权的宗教流亡者，以此作为增加普鲁士人口的一种方式。
7. ——这又是一项符合启蒙运动理念的政策。他称自己为“人民的公仆”。
8. 但话虽如此，腓特烈建立了一支庞大的常备军。
9. 他将军队人数从他父亲时期的大约8万人增加到了20万人。
10. 他还强迫贵族为国家服务。
11. 要么在军队中，要么在王国的行政管理中。
12. 而且，就像一位优秀的启蒙运动思想家一样，他减轻了在他自己的庄园里劳作的农奴的负担。
13. 但他也通过增加忠诚的贵族对其领地内农奴的控制权来奖励他们。
14. 进一步剥夺了他最弱势臣民的权利。
15. 腓特烈所奖励的这些日益强大的地主贵族，用德语来说就是“容克”（Junkers）。
16. 正是伏尔泰和其他哲学家在他们的作品中因贵族的傲慢和专横而痛斥的那类人。
17. 腓特烈甚至阻止有才能的平民在官僚机构或军队中获得高位。
18. 进一步巩固了贵族的权力。

感谢“思想泡泡”！无论如何，由于所谓开明的腓特烈大帝的政策，在普鲁士，拥有贵族血统的人在第一次世界大战期间甚至更久的时间里，在政治和军队中仍然拥有重大的话语权。

然后还有伏尔泰的另一位朋友，前面提到的俄罗斯的叶卡捷琳娜大帝。对于一个不喜欢专制主义的人来说，伏尔泰可真是和很多专制主义者交情匪浅。

作为沙皇（Czar），叶卡捷琳娜试图制定标准化的法律法规，这带有一些启蒙运动的色彩，但主要是为了缓解所有那些想要影响皇家政策（比如新君主的选拔方式）的团体之间的争斗。

为这些决策而争斗的人包括家族、皇家卫队的各个派系、有影响力的神职人员团体，以及商业贸易者和普通公民中的小团体。

所以，叶卡捷琳娜召集了来自各个社会群体的代表来听取他们的意见。

而她发现，每个人都只想着改善自己的特权或生活境遇——农奴似乎最需要帮助，而商人想要拥有农奴的权利，贵族则想要得到更多的一切。

最终，叶卡捷琳娜没能让代表们首先考虑整个帝国的需求。

现在，和其他开明君主一样，她的政策确实旨在追求理性，但在巩固国家权力方面尤其如此，这当然对她的统治有利。

所以有人会说，她更关注的是自己的利益而非帝国的利益，但是，和其他开明君主以及在她之前的彼得大帝一样，叶卡捷琳娜确实重视教育。她甚至为女孩创办了学校，而在当时，人们普遍认为女孩不需要接受教育。这位女皇还编写了第一部俄语词典，并任命了一位女性来负责这个项目。

她致力于修建道路和促进贸易，以使俄罗斯实现经济上的统一。

但是，和其他一些开明君主一样，叶卡捷琳娜也提升了贵族的重要性，并巩固了他们的特权。

她声称想要改善农奴的地位，这再次迎合了哲学家们的人道主义关怀，然而她却征收对普通人影响最大的税。

这些君主中的大多数人都希望建立一个更精简、更高效的皇家行政机构，但不一定是出于哲学上的原因。

他们从管理良好的军队中获益，而且他们确实从税收中获益。在这个武器不断改进、维持大规模常备军成本日益增加的时代，税收不仅需要增加，还需要更有效地征收。

换句话说，政府需要理性地运作——不是根据命运或个人的突发奇想，而是根据国家的需求。

例如，在1770年，哈布斯堡（Habsburg）女皇玛丽亚·特蕾西亚（Maria Theresa），尽管那张画像看起来她和叶卡捷琳娜大帝像是双胞胎姐妹，但其实不是。她派遣士兵重新给城市住房编址，并在文化各异、甚至语言都不相同的群体中使编址标准化。

士兵们被要求统计帝国的臣民数量，同时还要听取他们关于健康和幸福的个人报告。这种自我报告通过表明国家关心他们并询问他们的需求，有助于团结帝国内广泛的居民——这在今天可能看起来微不足道，但想想在18世纪，一个几乎很少与帝国政府有实质性接触的农民会怎么想。

宽容是启蒙运动的一个理想，它也有助于增加帝国中有用公民的数量。比如，当玛丽亚·特蕾西亚的继任者，奥地利（Austria）的约瑟夫二世（Joseph II）在他的统治期间宣布解放哈布斯堡帝国（Habsburg Empire）的犹太人时，他颁布法令规定，犹太人除了在宗教仪式中之外，不能使用他们自己的语言。这是一种让他们更好地融入帝国劳动力的方式，但该法令也指出：“必须结束一些臣民，尤其是那些无知的人，对犹太民族表现出的偏见和蔑视。” 该法令还提到了对犹太人 “可悲” 甚至 “犯罪的行为”，并呼吁结束这种行为，以此来加强帝国。[1]

约瑟夫二世可能是所有开明君主中最具真正开明思想的人，他还从其他方面抨击了古老的观念，比如削弱贵族对农奴的控制。

他鼓励农业实验，包括建立一个更自由的农业劳动力队伍。所以，在他的改革下，农奴不再需要为他们劳作的贵族提供个人服务，他们甚至可以离开庄园去当工匠或从事贸易。

“我已经让哲学成为我帝国的立法者。” 约瑟夫宣称，在某些方面，这是事实。[2] 但贵族们进行了反抗，在约瑟夫去世后，他的弟弟兼继任者废除了这些启蒙运动时期的改革。

大约在约瑟夫统治奥地利的同一时期，在启蒙运动的发源地法国（French），像路易十五（Louis the XV）这样的统治者也在倾听变革的声音，并试图顺应这些声音，但是，你知道的，前提是不失去权力。那时和现在一样，每个人都希望变革，只要这种变革不会对他们产生负面影响。

所以，法国统治者试图通过废除高等法院（Parlements）来改革税收制度并精简政府，因为高等法院阻碍了君主使税收制度更加公平的努力。

高等法院负责登记皇家法令，其成员可以将自己的职位卖给出价最高的人。皇家顾问们表示，他们不明白为什么这些资金不流入政府，他们还质疑是否需要一群人专门负责登记皇家法令。但是高等法院的成员设法以皇家暴政的口号煽动了普通民众。所以国王最终做出了让步。

同样，另一位改革派大臣以自由贸易的名义取消了对粮食市场的关税和监管。但是粮食的流通受到了干扰，这引发了民众的强烈不满。改革在理论上可能是好的，但当真正实施时，改革往往会破坏社会稳定，并与既得利益发生冲突。对很多人来说是好消息的事情，对另一些人来说可能仍然是坏消息。那时和现在都是如此。

最后但同样重要的是西班牙人（Spanish），他们拥有庞大的帝国，特别渴望精简政府并增加财政收入。

为此，皇家行政机构实施了被称为 “波旁改革”（Bourbon reforms）的政策变革，这使得政府管理更加有效，尤其是在税收征收方面。

这些改革也允许在殖民地出生的西班牙裔人在殖民地的官僚机构和军队中获得更高的职位，但他们仍然无法进入最高层，当然，原住民也是如此。

此外，由于皇家行政机构认为殖民地的天主教会（Catholic Church）在争夺当地民众的忠诚并抽走资金，行政机构宣布耶稣会（Jesuits）为非法组织，据称耶稣会是一群腐败且有影响力的神学家的头目，他们试图让人们忠于耶稣而不是西班牙国王。

好了，彩色玻璃窗又出现了，这意味着是时候做总结了。

启蒙运动思想丰富多样，蕴含着变革的可能性，但并非受到所有人的欢迎，所有这些改革都有反对者。有时，城市居民会因为物价上涨或贸易政策变化导致食物短缺而表示反对。

而且，在贵族失去对农奴的控制权或不得不缴纳额外税收的情况下，比如在哈布斯堡君主国，贵族们常常抗议启蒙运动时期的改革。

尽管如此，贵族们的生活总体上变得好得多了。随着18世纪的发展，越来越多的贵族生活奢华无比，当我们今天参观欧洲留存下来的众多17和18世纪的城堡时，仍然会为之惊叹。

在很多情况下，他们拥有中国瓷器以及许多其他奢侈品。他们能够获得廉价劳动力，这些劳动力为他们提供了充足的食物，也让他们有机会建造宏伟的建筑来彰显他们的奢华和特权。

尽管经历了20世纪战争的大规模破坏，这些建筑中的许多至今仍然存在。但18世纪日益加剧的贫困却几乎没有留下什么痕迹。

这种日益加剧的贫困与欧洲不断增长的技术知识和生产力并存，穷人看到富人变得越来越富，而他们自己却常常只能吃着掺有锯末的面包。

随着政府巩固其行政机构并发动了数量几乎令人难以置信的战争，穷人将接近爆发的临界点。从法国开始，他们将反抗贵族。即将到来的变革甚至让狡猾的君主们也无法适应。

Hi, I’m John Green, and this is Crash Course European History.

So, last week we discussed the Enlightenment philosophers who challenged the idea that kings and nobles were qualified to be elites simply because of the families into which they were born.

But still, monarchs were also interested in Enlightenment ideals, and also understood they needed to effectively adapt to the Enlightenment, as they had adapted to previous changes in theology and philosophy.

For instance, Catherine II (or Catherine “the Great”) of Russia corresponded often and enthusiastically with Voltaire, even though he criticized despotic rule. And she also offered to print Diderot’s Encyclopedia in Russia when France censored it.

We use the term “Enlightened Monarchs” to refer to the rulers who supported and applauded Enlightenment thinkers. But were they in fact Enlightened, or did they remain absolutist despots? The answer will surprise you, unless you have even a passing familiarity with despots.

[Intro]

First, let’s review what the philosophes criticized in the practices of rulers and aristocratic leaders. They singled out torture, censorship, and their arrogance and capriciousness. Like, kings and their nobility could have ordinary people thrown into prison for just about any reason—large or small. And in general, most of the Enlightenment thinkers believed that nobles, and the system that supported them, were despotic from top to bottom.

French theorist Montesquieu, whom we met in the previous episode as the author of the satiric Persian Letters, also published The Spirit of Laws in 1748. In it, he discussed customs and types of government as they were influenced by climate, and topography, and other variables.

To him, there was no God-given standard of divine right rule. Instead, Montesquieu focused on three basic types of government: democracies, suitable for very small states; monarchies that ruled mid-sized kingdoms; and despotic states such as empires that were governed with an iron hand.

Voltaire and other philosophes elaborated on these theories: and many preferred Britain’s post-Glorious Revolution type of law-based monarchy, where courts and a parliament were separate from the monarch’s power and a Bill of Rights ensured certain protections to citizens.

All of this—the enshrining of rights, independent courts, parliamentary representation—meant that power was balanced among multiple institutions. Also, the multiplicity of religions in Britain was seen as another assurance; it prevented a despotic religious institution from gaining control of the government.

Now, we’ve seen from examples like Poland-Lithuania that distributed power and diversity of belief sometimes means internal conflict and political gridlock that weakens a state, but in Britain, Enlightenment philosophers saw an example of a state that was strong without being despotic.

And in part because they had an example to point to, the Enlightenment philosophers were difficult for those in the upper echelons of government and society to ignore. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

1. King Frederick the Great of Prussia was renowned for his love of refinement and his interest in music and design.
2. Like his friend Voltaire, Frederick the Great collected Chinese porcelain.
3. He also wrote an opera about the Aztec emperor Monteczuma.
4. which praised Monteczuma for religious toleration.
5. and seemed to agree with Enlightenment activists who fought against religious bigotry and torture.
6. And Frederick also welcomed religious exiles from less tolerant regimes as a way of building the Prussian population.
7. —again a policy in line with Enlightenment. He called himself “a servant of the people.”
8. But all that said, Frederick built a massive standing army.
9. increasing the armed forces to 200,000 men from his father’s army of 80,000ish.
10. And he also forced the aristocracy to serve the state.
11. either in the army or in the administration of the kingdom.
12. And while like a good Enlightenment thinker he lightened the burden of serfs working his own estates.
13. he also rewarded loyal aristocrats by increasing their control over the serfs living in their territories.
14. further disenfranchising the most vulnerable of his subjects.
15. These increasingly empowered landed aristocrats, or Junkers to use the German term, that Frederick rewarded.
16. were the very type that Voltaire and other philosophes lambasted in their writings for the aristocrats’ pride and highhandedness.
17. Frederick even blocked talented commoners from achieving high positions in either the bureaucracy or the army.
18. entrenching aristocratic power still further.

Thanks, Thought Bubble. At any rate, as a result of the supposedly enlightened Frederick the Great’s policies, men of aristocratic pedigree in Prussia continued to have a major say in politics and the army into World War I and even beyond.

And then there was another of Voltaire’s friends, the aforementioned Catherine the Great of Russia. For someone who disliked absolutism, Voltaire sure was pals with a lot of absolutists.

As Czar, Catherine sought to create standardized codes of laws and regulations, which had an Enlightenment-ish tinge, but was mostly an attempt to ease the struggle between all the groups that wanted to shape royal policy like how new monarchs were selected.

The people who fought over these decisions included clans, factions of the Royal Guard, groups of influential clergy, and cliques among commercial traders and ordinary citizens.

So, Catherine summoned representatives from all social groups for their input.

And she found that each only thought about bettering their own privileges or lot in life—the serfs seemed to have the most need for help, while merchants wanted the right to own serfs, and the nobility wanted more of everything.

Ultimately, Catherine failed in getting representatives to think first and foremost of the needs of the empire as a whole.

Now, like other enlightened monarchs, her policies did aim to be rational, but this was especially true when it came to consolidating state power, which of course benefited her office.

So one could argue she was also focused on her interests over those of the empire, but, like other enlightened monarchs and like Peter the Great before her, Catherine did emphasize education. She even founded schools for girls, who were generally seen as not needing an education. The empress also created the first Russian dictionary and appointed a woman to head the project.

She undertook the building of roads and the fostering of trade to bring economic unity to Russia.

But, like some other Enlightened monarchs, Catherine also boosted the importance of the aristocracy and she consolidated their privileges.

She professed to want to improve the status of the serf population, again bowing to the philosophes’ humanitarian concerns, while imposing taxes that affected ordinary people the most.

Most of these monarchs wanted a more streamlined and efficient royal administration, but not necessarily for philosophical reasons.

They benefited from well run armies, and they really benefited from taxes. During this age of ever-improving weaponry and higher costs for larger standing armies, taxes needed to be increased and also collected more efficiently.

In other words, governments needed to operate rationally—not according to the whims of fate or individuals, but according to the needs of the state.

In 1770, for instance, Habsburg empress Maria Theresa, who despite that portrait was not twin sisters with Catherine the Great, deployed soldiers to renumber the addresses of urban housing and standardize them across culturally diverse groups who didn’t even speak the same language.

The soldiers were told to count the empire’s subjects but also to listen to their individual reports on health and well-being. And this self-reporting served to unify the empire’s wide-range of inhabitants by showing that the state cared enough to count them and ask them about their needs—that might seem minor today, but consider being an 18th century peasant who rarely if ever had meaningful contact with the imperial government.

Toleration was an Enlightenment ideal that also served to increase the number of useful citizens in an empire. Like when Maria Theresa’s successor Joseph II of Austria announced the emancipation of the Jews in the Habsburg Empire during his administration, he decreed that Jews could not use their own language except in religious services. Which was a way to better integrate them into the imperial workforce, but the decree also said, “there must be an end to the prejudice and contempt which some subjects, particularly the unintelligent, have shown towards the Jewish nation.” The decree also noted the “deplorable” and even “criminal behavior” towards Jews and called for it to end as a way of strengthening the empire.[1]

Joseph II, was probably, like, the most actually enlightened of the enlightenment monarchs, also struck at ancient ideas in other ways, like by diminishing the grip of the aristocracy on serfs.

He encouraged agricultural experimentation, including the creation of a freer agricultural work force. So, under his reforms, serfs no longer owed personal service to aristocrats, whose lands they worked, and they could even leave an estate to work as an artisan or in trade.

“I have made philosophy the lawmaker of my empire,” Joseph claimed, and in some ways that was true.[2] But the aristocracy rebelled, and after Joseph’s death, his brother and successor rolled back these Enlightenment reforms.

Around the same time that Joseph was ruling Austria, in the French home of Enlightenment, rulers like Louis the XV were also listening to the voices of change and attempting to follow them, but, you know, without losing power. Then as now, everyone wanted change so long as it did not affect them negatively.

So, French rulers tried to reform taxation and streamline government by getting rid of the Parlements, which blocked the monarchy’s attempts at making taxes a bit more equitable.

The Parlements registered royal decrees and their members could sell their jobs to the highest bidder. Royal advisors were like, I don’t understand why those funds don’t go to the government and they also questioned whether there needed to be a bunch of people whose job was to register royal decrees. But the members of the Parlement managed to rouse ordinary people with cries of royal tyranny. So the king eventually backed down.

Similarly, another reforming minister lifted tariffs and regulations on the grain market in the name of free trade. But the flow of food was interrupted which caused a huge outburst from people. Reform might be good in theory, but when actually enacted, reform often upset social stability and clashed with vested interests. Good news for lots of people was still bad news for some people. Then as now.

Last but not least were the Spanish, who with their vast empire were especially eager to streamline government and enhance revenue.

To this end the royal administration enacted policy changes known as the Bourbon reforms, which made governmental administration more effective, especially when it came to collecting taxes.

These reforms also allowed people of Spanish descent born in the colonies to rise a bit higher in the colonial bureaucracy and army, but they were still prevented from reaching the very top echelons, as of course were native people.

Also because the royal administration saw the Catholic Church in the colonies as competing for local people’s loyalty and siphoning off funds, the administration outlawed the Jesuits, alleged to be at the head of a corrupt and influential pack of theologians who were trying to get people to be loyal to Jesus instead of the Spanish king.

All right, the stained glass window is back, which means it must be time for the conclusion.

Enlightenment thought, which was rich and wide-ranging in possibilities for change, wasn’t universally popular, and all these reforms had their detractors. At times, urban people objected as prices rose or as food became scarce because of changes in trade policies.

And in cases where aristocrats were losing command over serfs or having to pay additional taxes, like in the Habsburg monarchy, aristocrats often protested Enlightenment reforms.

Still, life was on average getting a lot better for aristocrats. As the eighteenth century progressed, more of them lived in outsized splendor that can still impress us today when we visit the many chateaux across Europe that remain from the 17th and 18th centuries.

In many cases they had Chinese porcelain, and lots of other luxury goods. They had access to inexpensive labor that provided them with plenty of food, and also the chance to make huge monuments to their luxury and privilege.

And despite the massive destruction of twentieth century wars, many of those monuments survive today. But little remains of the rising poverty of the 18th century.

That growing poverty occurred alongside growing European know-how and productivity, and the poor saw that the rich were getting richer even as they were often eating bread cut with sawdust.

As governments consolidated their administrations and waged an almost unbelievable number of wars, the poor would approach a breaking point. And beginning in France, they would rebel against the aristocracy. Changes were coming that not even wily monarchs could adapt to.
