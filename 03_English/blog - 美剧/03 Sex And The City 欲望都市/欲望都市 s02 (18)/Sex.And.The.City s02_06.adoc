They say that most New Yorkers will attend the opening of an envelope + 
as long as the champagne doesn't run dry. + 
But tonight's opening at Charlotte's gallery for Yael, + 
a lesbian painter from Brooklyn Heights, + 
actually transcended the bad wine, stale cheese routine. + 
It was lesbian chic meets art world cool. + 
A surprisingly fabulous combustion + 
that no one saw coming. + 
Charlotte was there with her latest flame, + 
Gareth Davis, + 
toxic bachelor and the owner of Thorn, + 
a downtown restaurant frequented by second-tier models + 
and the men who buy them salad. + 
Miranda brought Ethan Watson, + 
A documentary filmmaker whom she had met the week before + 
at a sparsely attended Harvard alumni mixer. + 
And my date for the evening was Samantha, + 
not entirely inappropriate given the circumstances. + 
Here. + 
Nobody told me it was B-Y-O man. + 
Well, what did you expect? It's a lesbian art show. + 
I know but don't straight guys usually follow them around + 
to see what they're going to do? + 
Wait a second. + 
You see that guy? + 
Who? -I know him. + 
Who is he? + 
He's a trainer at my gym. + 
And you should see his squat thrusts. + 
I'm just gonna say hello. + 
You know what, honey? I think I'm-- I think I'm gonna go home. + 
Well, relax, I'll be right back. + 
You know what? I really don't-- I don't feel very well. + 
What's wrong? + 
I just have a headache, it just hit me. + 
You want a Percodan? + 
No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine, I just need some sleep. + 
Go ahead, make new friends. + 
I'll call you. + 
Okay. + 
With Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte all suitably occupied, + 
I figured there was no better time to make my escape. + 
The truth was I had another engagement. + 
But I didn't dare tell any of my friends + 
where I was going. + 
Or who I was planning to meet. + 
Wow. + 
You look sensational. + 
You don't look so bad yourself. + 
Oh, this old thing? + 
I've had it for years. + 
Sure, I knew it was wrong, + 
seeing an emotionally unavailable man + 
I had sworn off months earlier. + 
But the guilt worked like an aphrodisiac. + 
I had never felt sexier or more alive in my entire life. + 
By midnight, Charlotte discovered Manhattan's latest group + 
to flaunt their disposable income... + 
The power lesbian. + 
They seemed to have everything. + 
Great shoes, killer eyewear + 
and the secrets to invisible makeup. + 
I want that one, I'm gonna take it. + 
Didn't I say I was buying that piece? + 
I thought you were taking the large painting when it came in. + 
I want both. + 
Oh, for God's sakes. + 
Charlotte had never sold out a show before in her life. + 
She was pleasantly surprised. + 
Unfortunately, there was a not so pleasant surprise + 
in store for her that evening. + 
We're out of champagne. + 
Well, I'm sure I have an extra case or two in the back storeroom. + 
Okay. + 
Excuse me. + 
Hey, relax, we're just kissing. + 
I'll see you in there. + 
I can't believe he had the nerve to stand there + 
kissing that woman and still pretend he wasn't cheating on me. + 
Well, maybe he doesn't consider kissing cheating. + 
Oh, c'mon, it was only your second date. + 
So? + 
Doesn't that still guarantee me fidelity + 
until the end of the evening? + 
Do you remember Ron, + 
the married guy with two kids on Park Avenue? + 
He didn't consider fucking below 23rd Street cheating. + 
Well, that's insane. + 
Men cheat for the same reason that dogs lick their balls. + 
Because they can. + 
It's part of their biology. + 
Instead of wasting all this energy condemning it, + 
maybe it's time we all got in line + 
with the reality of the situation. + 
Well, that sounds very empowering, + 
but you're forgetting one important detail. + 
God, I hope so. + 
Women cheat. + 
-Yeah, but it's completely different. -How? + 
'Cause we don't go around randomly attacking any man that we're attracted to. + 
Speak for yourself. + 
We're not driven by testosterone. + 
Then what does drive us according to you? + 
Emotions. + 
You mean hormones. + 
No, I mean that little voice inside of me + 
that says, "Mate for life, mate for life." + 
Sweetheart, you can't go listening to every fucking little voice + 
that runs through your head, it'll drive you nuts. + 
The problem is that you two have very different definitions + 
of what constitutes cheating. + 
Well, I don't tolerate it. + 
And I'm more forgiving + 
and realistic about human nature. + 
That's because you cheat. + 
I just don't think that you can define cheating + 
in absolute terms. + 
You're saying you think it's okay to cheat? + 
Well, I think maybe there's a cheating curve. + 
That someone's definition of what constitutes cheating + 
is in direct proportion to how much they themselves want to cheat. + 
That's moral relativism. + 
I prefer to think of it as quantum cheating. + 
The fact is, the act of cheating + 
is defined by the act of getting caught. + 
One doesn't exist without the other. + 
I wondered, was Samantha right? + 
Is cheating like the proverbial tree in the forest? + 
That it doesn't exist if there's no one around to catch you? + 
In a gravity free world of anything goes, + 
what constitutes cheating? + 
Everybody cheats. + 
That's the great thing about having a trainer. + 
Seven, keep your neck back. + 
Eight. + 
Pisses me off seeing people train improperly. + 
Well, I guess I better behave then. + 
I'm all about form and discipline. + 
Do it right or don't bother doing it at all. + 
Yes. + 
Samantha realized that while purity of form exacted a price, + 
it also had its own rewards. + 
So, how do you feel? + 
You got me all wet. + 
I mean sweaty. + 
Same time on Wednesday? + 
It's a date. + 
Later that day, Charlotte realized + 
she was just plain tired of listening + 
to another man's weak justifications... + 
You don't understand. + 
She's an old friend of my sister's from college. + 
She just moved to the city and her uncle died last month + 
and I was just trying to be supportive. + 
Besides, + 
you're the one I want to sleep with. + 
...when she felt her life take a fortuitous turn. + 
Gareth, + 
I've got to go. + 
Wait, wait, what? + 
Hi, nice to see you. + 
I just came in to pay for my painting. + 
It's her painting for six months. + 
Then she's selling it back to me. + 
Excuse me, + 
I'm the one with the big loft + 
and all the empty white walls. + 
Oh, look at it, I am so excited. + 
-Excuse me. + 
By the way, love the Prada loafers. + 
-Thanks. -Yeah? + 
Power lesbians and their shoes + 
are like Wall Street brokers and their cigars. + 
Yael has told me so many nice things about you. + 
How long have you been doing the art thing? + 
Uh, ten years, no, 12 years. + 
I'm losing track. + 
Almost five years at this gallery. + 
What do you do? + 
I'm a V.P. at Warner Music. + 
Eileen works on Wall Street. + 
And how long have you two been together? + 
Used to be together. + 
Five years, we're just friends now. + 
That is so cool. + 
Hold on. Hey, want to join Melissa and Drew + 
in about an hour for a drink? + 
Sure. + 
Would you like to join us for a drink? + 
Oh, I wish I could, but, uh... + 
But what? + 
The truth is, Charlotte couldn't think + 
of one really good reason not to go. + 
I'd love to. + 
One drink at G-Spot, + 
the hottest new girl bar in town, + 
followed by dinner and scintillating conversation at Luxe, + 
a hot new French-fusion restaurant + 
with an even hotter Sapphic chef, + 
followed by late night dancing at Love Tunnel, + 
left Charlotte exhilarated and happy + 
as she'd been in ages. + 
There was something relaxing and liberating + 
in traveling through an alternate universe + 
that contained no thought of men. + 
By the end of the night, Charlotte had truly made + 
some wonderful new friends. + 
That night, Miranda was exhausted from her own night on the town. + 
She had spent the last four hours in the dark with Ethan, + 
watching the classic holocaust documentary, Shoah . + 
Shoah is so much better than that fakey, stagy Schindler's List . + 
A narrative film can't begin to touch + 
the horror of experience. + 
Only documentaries can really begin to capture the truth. + 
In fact, the entire concept of narrative film is just... + 
is bogus. + 
You know, it's-- + 
Want to come back to my place? + 
Miranda was pleased to discover + 
that Ethan was as passionate between the sheets + 
as he was on the subject of non-narrative film. + 
But just as they were getting down to business, + 
Miranda realized they were not alone. + 
What's that for? + 
Just something to get us in the mood. + 
I think it's kind of sexy, don't you? + 
Yeah, I guess it could be. + 
Miranda realized that Ethan's passion for film + 
had taken on a new and interesting twist. + 
A few nights later, after a midnight show + 
of Gimme Shelter at the Waverly, + 
Miranda discovered that Ethan's new friends were hard to shake. + 
Does that really need to be on? + 
No. + 
It just really turns me on. + 
Aren't I enough? + 
Yeah, you're great. + 
I can turn off the sound if it bugs you. + 
Could you move your head a bit to the right? + 
Yeah, that's great. + 
That night, in Mr. Big's kitchen, + 
I performed an unnatural act of my own. + 
I cooked. + 
Voila, fondue. + 
You didn't cook, you just heated up cheese. + 
And tore up little pieces of bread. + 
Well, I'm touched by your effort. + 
Okay. + 
It's the only recipe I could ever master. + 
Alrighty. + 
-Now... + 
Tell me you love it. + 
Oh... Mmm. + 
Tasty. + 
Now you tell me. + 
It's horrible. + 
Can we go to a restaurant now? + 
Mm-hmm. + 
I take it back, you're an excellent cook. + 
I haven't told any of my friends we're seeing each other again. + 
Neither have I. + 
Well, that doesn't count, you have no friends. + 
I have interested parties. + 
Then why haven't you told them? + 
I sensed you didn't want me to. + 
Bullshit. + 
Well, what do you want me to tell people? + 
Nothing. + 
Good idea, let's keep it quiet. + 
Why do you want to keep it quiet? + 
I just want to be agreeable. + 
The truth is, + 
I wasn't sure why I wanted to keep the fact + 
that I was seeing Big again so under wraps. + 
All I knew is that it felt somehow elicit. + 
I didn't even want to be caught waking up there. + 
That morning, at 7:00 a.m., + 
as I walked the walk of shame back to my apartment... + 
Carrie? + 
Miranda, oh my God. + 
What are you doing up here? + 
Oh, uh, teeth cleaning. + 
At 7:00 a.m.? + 
Well, I just... I like to get it over with. + 
Hey, how's Ethan? + 
Aside from the fact that he's addicted to porn? + 
Still, huh? + 
It was kind of sexy at first, + 
but it's just getting borderline humiliating. + 
Move your head here, move your head there. + 
You would think that the real thing + 
would be more exciting than a tape, wouldn't you? + 
Well, maybe it's just a force of habit. + 
Sure, but I get the feeling + 
he's more interested in the girls in the video than me. + 
Like he's cheating on me with them + 
while we're having sex. + 
I don't know, am I expecting too much? + 
No, no, you deserve his undivided attention. + 
Thank you. + 
I have to go, I have an 8:00 a.m. breakfast meeting. + 
-Carry on. -You're kind of dressed up + 
-for the dentist. -Oh, laundry day. + 
-Ah! -Ah! + 
-Got it. -Bye, sweetie. + 
Bye. I felt horrible. + 
I had never lied to Miranda before. + 
But I was embarrassed to admit that I was seeing Big again. + 
The truth was I was cheating on her and all my friends + 
with Mr. Big. + 
That afternoon, Samantha got very personal with her new trainer, Thor. + 
I feel like such a cliché. + 
I bet you sleep with all your clients. + 
-I really don't, but... -No? + 
...it's always been kind of a fantasy for me. + 
Maybe I could train you. + 
Why don't we take a shower first? + 
You got great legs. + 
If I knew we were going to be doing this + 
I would have shaved them. + 
That's alright, I'll shave them for you. + 
Are you a dirty girl? + 
I guess that depends on your definition of dirty. + 
And then to Samantha's surprise and delight... + 
Thor kept right on shaving. + 
What is this thing that guys have these days + 
about wanting to shave your pubic hair? + 
It's obvious, they want a little girl. + 
No, actually, in Thor's case, + 
it was more like being branded. + 
What are you talking about? + 
He shaved me in a shape, a lightning bolt. + 
Where do you find these guys? + 
Carrie, are you listening to this? + 
That very personal trainer of Samantha's + 
shaved her crotch in the shape of a lightning bolt. + 
Oh, really? It's very creative. + 
It's sort of like "X marks the spot." + 
You know, it's a very neglected area. + 
-But people are really starting to pay attention. -Uh-huh. + 
You can't just let it grow wild anymore. + 
There's an entire business these days + 
devoted to the upkeep and management of pubic hair. + 
It says as much about you as your shoes. + 
Congratulations, it sounds like you found yourself + 
a very talented stylist. + 
Carrie, what are you doing in there? + 
You know what? + 
Can somebody get that? I'll be out in a sec. + 
Hey, sorry I'm late. + 
Wow. + 
You didn't have to get all dressed up for us. + 
Why not? You did your hair. + 
Well, it's not for you guys. + 
I'm meeting Lydia and her friends later on tonight. + 
Lydia, who's Lydia? + 
Haven't you heard? Charlotte's a lesbian. + 
I am not a lesbian. + 
I just have some new lesbian friends. + 
She's been out with them three times in the past week. + 
So? + 
They're cool and they buy art + 
and their lives aren't complicated by men. + 
I was a major lesbian in the 4th grade. + 
Wendy Kirsten, we kissed, it was nice. + 
They know you're straight, right? + 
Oh, I'm sure they do. + 
But we don't even talk about sex. + 
Believe me, it's a non-issue. + 
You have to tell them. + 
Otherwise you're just leading them on. + 
That's right, you're nothing but a big clit tease. + 
What are you saying? That a straight woman + 
and a gay woman can't be friends? + 
Of course they can, + 
but you can't expect to move to Wonder Woman's island + 
and not go native. + 
Where's Carrie? + 
If she doesn't get out of the bathroom soon + 
we're gonna miss the movie. + 
Is everything okay in there? + 
Actually, no. + 
I need help. + 
This is embarrassing. + 
But I got a new diaphragm and it's stuck. + 
How long has it been in there? + 
Since last night. + 
You mean while you were out getting your teeth cleaned this morning? + 
-It was... -Yep. + 
Now listen, + 
I'm either gonna have to make an emergency visit to my gynecologist + 
or one of you is gonna have to give me a hand. + 
I'd help you but I'm not very dexterous. + 
You're the lesbian, go in there. + 
No. + 
Go. + 
And I just had my nails done. + 
You are so buying me dinner. + 
Wait a second, aren't we skipping a beat here? + 
Who are you sleeping with? + 
It's something that started again a few weeks ago. + 
I don't know if it's real or not + 
so I didn't want to say anything. + 
But... it's Big. + 
-Oh, my God. -What? + 
You're sleeping with Big? + 
Carrie, he was such an asshole to you. + 
Not really. + 
I mean, maybe sometimes, but... + 
What makes you think it's gonna be any different this time? + 
I don't know, I'm not sure they are, + 
but, it just, it kind of feels okay. + 
If it feels okay, why are you sneaking behind our backs? + 
Look, we've got this physical, chemical kind of connection + 
that's hard to shake, so lay off, okay? + 
So, now it's gonna be a casual sex thing? + 
-Maybe. -Well, that's gonna work. + 
Even I am not that naive. + 
You know what? I'm really not in the mood to see a movie anymore. + 
-Carrie. -Carrie. + 
-Come, uh... -I didn't... + 
C'mon! + 
I couldn't sleep at all that night. + 
The problem was my friends were right. + 
Falling into this casual thing with Big + 
without a sense of what happened or where it was going + 
suddenly felt like a huge mistake. + 
The next morning, Charlotte attended brunch at the home of Patty Aston, + 
the ex-wife of a Hollywood television producer. + 
If power lesbians represented Manhattan's chicest new social hive, + 
Charlotte was about to meet their queen bee. + 
Patty is such an amazing lady. + 
She sits on the board of like a hundred charities. + 
And now she's taking flying lessons. + 
She's also got this gorgeous house in Telluride. + 
We're all going there for Easter, you should come. + 
I'd love to. + 
She also has some very interesting art. + 
Diana the Huntress. + 
I got her on sale. + 
Patty, this is Charlotte. + 
A pleasure. + 
I've heard so many wonderful things about you. + 
Likewise. + 
I was just telling Charlotte about + 
your amazing house in Telluride. + 
Sounds wonderful. + 
I'm just gonna go get us some drinks. + 
-Champagne? -Sure. + 
Do you ski? + 
Yes, but not well. + 
I guess I'm what you'd call a snow bunny. + 
You know, I just kind of hop, hop, hop down the bunny trail. + 
Yes, well, it's not a prerequisite, believe me. + 
It's just wonderful to be out of the city and in the mountains. + 
Absolutely. + 
So, you should plan to join us the next time. + 
I know Lydia would love it if you could. + 
That's very generous of you, thank you. + 
But before we all get on a plane together, + 
there's something I think everyone wants to know. + 
Are you gay? + 
No. + 
No, I'm not. + 
But I do so enjoy the company of all these women. + 
Everyone's so smart and funny. + 
I'm just spending way too much time and attention on men. + 
It feels like such a safe, warm environment. + 
And while sexually, + 
I feel that I am straight, + 
there's a very powerful part of me + 
that connects to the female spirit. + 
Sweetheart, that's all very nice, + 
but if you're not gonna eat pussy, you're not a dyke. + 
Later that afternoon, + 
following a particularly grueling workout with Thor, + 
Samantha decided to take a relaxing steam. + 
That asshole! + 
That day at the gym, + 
Samantha discovered that lightning does indeed strike twice. + 
That evening, Miranda was treated to a double bill. + 
Nanook of The North , at Alice Tully Hall, + 
and Steady As She Blows at Ethan Watson's Porn Palace. + 
Hold it right there. + 
Alright, that's enough! + 
This is not a synchronized event. + 
Look... + 
I like you. + 
But this is getting ridiculous. + 
It's either the women in the video or me. + 
Your choice, but you can't have both. + 
Miranda, it's not that simple. + 
I've only known you for a few weeks. + 
But I've been involved with some of those women for years. + 
I am so out of here. + 
That night, for the first time ever, + 
Big took me out dancing. + 
It was like he knew that I needed to talk to him + 
and decided to make it as difficult as possible. + 
Our attraction, or addiction, or whatever was strong. + 
But I knew I had to be stronger. + 
So does this mean we're seeing each other again? + 
Officially? + 
If you say so. + 
That is an infuriating response. + 
I don't know what officially means. + 
Officially means officially. + 
Oh. + 
You know, for real. + 
Every moment of my life is for real, baby. + 
Well, just answer me this... + 
Why did we break up? + 
You tell me. + 
You're the one who left me high and dry + 
with two tickets to St. Barths. + 
You didn't say what I wanted to hear. + 
Oh. + 
Is that it? + 
No, not just that. + 
I wanted to tell him that I was afraid he could never love me + 
the way I wanted to be loved. + 
I was afraid that maybe he didn't really have the capacity + 
to love anyone but himself. + 
I was afraid that, given the chance, he'd break my heart again. + 
But I cheated and just said... + 
I guess I was afraid. + 
I can tell you one thing... + 
I sure did miss you... + 
Officially. + 
Did you cry? + 
No. + 
But I did listen to a hell of a lot of Sinatra. + 
And there it was... + 
I guess we were back together... + 
Officially. + 
Whatever that means. + 
欲望城市 + 
（性爱专家凯莉布雷萧） + 
“偷情曲线” + 
只要香槟源源不断地供应 + 
纽约人连拆封典礼也会参加 + 
但今晚夏绿蒂画廊为女同志 画家耶尔举行的展览开幕酒会 + 
却超越了传统劣酒 腐败乳酪的固定模式 + 
潇洒的女同志进入艺术殿堂 + 
悄悄地延烧出惊人的火花 + 
夏绿蒂和新男友盖瑞戴维斯 一起出席 + 
他是“荆棘”的老板 那是一家二流模特儿 + 
和包养她们的金主 时常光顾的餐厅 + 
米兰达的男伴是伊森华生 一个纪录片导演 + 
一周前她在很少人参加的 哈佛校友会上认识的 + 
而我今晚的伴是莎曼珊 + 
在这种场合还算恰当 + 
-没人告诉我要自备男伴 -这是女同志画展 + 
难道正常的男人 不会好奇地围着她们打转吗？ + 
慢着，你看那个男的 我认识他 + 
-他是谁？ -我健身房的教练 + 
你应该看他示范动作 我要去打个招呼 + 
-我想回家了 -我马上就回来 + 
-我不太舒服 -怎么了？ + 
-我头痛 -需要止痛药吗？ + 
不用，我睡一觉就行了 你去吧，去交新朋友 + 
-我再打给你 -好 + 
既然莎曼珊、米兰达 以及夏绿蒂都各有男伴了 + 
没有比现在更适合逃走的时机 + 
事实上我另有约会 + 
但我没告诉她们 我要去哪里或跟谁见面 + 
-你看起来真是艳光四射 -你也不赖 + 
这件旧衬衫？我穿好几年了 + 
我知道这是不对的 + 
和几个月前因无法付出感情 我发誓要脱离的男人见面 + 
但罪恶感就像催情剂 + 
我这辈子从未觉得如此性感 充满活力 + 
午夜前，夏绿蒂发现了一群 炫耀财富的新集团 + 
权力女同志 她们似乎拥有一切 + 
脚踩名贵的鞋子 脸上画着自然到看不出的裸妆 + 
那幅画我要了 + 
-我已经说我要买了 -你是要放大的 + 
-我两幅都要 -看在老天份上 + 
夏绿蒂从未在展览中售完画作 她感到十分惊喜 + 
可惜，有个不太愉快的 意外等着她 + 
-香槟喝完了 -储藏室还有一箱 + 
抱歉打扰 + 
别激动，我们只是接吻而已 + 
我们里头见 + 
他和那个女人正在接吻 还装得一副没偷腥的样子 + 
或许他认为接吻不算偷腥 + 
你们才第二次约会 + 
直到那夜结束之前 他都应该对我忠实 + 
记得朗吗，那个有妇之夫？ + 
他认为在23街以下 跟别的女人上床都不算偷腥 + 
男人偷腥的原因跟狗舔自己的 睾丸一样：因为他们办得到 + 
这是生物本能 + 
我们不但不该责备他们 + 
反而要欣然接受现实 + 
-你忘了一个重要的细节 -希望如此 + 
-女人也会偷腥 -这不一样 + 
我们不会随便 勾搭看上眼的男人 + 
-别一概而论 -我们又不受睾丸酮控制 + 
-不然我们受什么控制 -感情 + 
你是说荷尔蒙 + 
我内心深处有个小声音不停说 “找寻终生伴侣” + 
你不能听信脑海中每个声音 那会把你逼疯 + 
问题在于你们两个 对偷情的定义不同 + 
-我绝不能容忍 -我则对人性抱持现实的态度 + 
那是因为你会偷情 + 
偷情无法用绝对的措辞来定义 + 
-你的意思是偷情无罪？ -也许有所谓的偷情曲线 + 
一个人对于偷情的定义 + 
和他渴望出轨的程度恰成正比 + 
-那是道德相对论 -我认为是量子偷情论 + 
偷情的行为 要看有没有被抓到而定 + 
两者不能独立存在 + 
我不禁纳闷莎曼珊说对了吗？ + 
偷情已经变得稀松平常 + 
如果没被发现就不算吗？ + 
在一个无奇不有的世界 到底何谓偷情？ + 
人人都会偷懒 这就是有教练的好处 + 
七…脖子不要动 + 
看到有人姿势不正确 我就火冒三丈 + 
那我最好照规矩来 + 
我最讲究标准动作和严格把关 姿势要正确，否则根本别做 + 
是 + 
莎曼珊体会到完美的身材 虽然需要付出代价 + 
它也有回报 + 
-你觉得怎么样？ -你让我全湿了…满身是汗 + 
-下周三同一时间？ -就这么说定 + 
夏绿蒂听腻了男人 毫无说服力的藉口 + 
她是我妹妹的一个老朋友 + 
上个月她叔叔过世 我只是想安慰她 + 
再说，你才是我想上床的对象 + 
她感觉她的人生 偶然地转了个弯 + 
盖瑞，我得挂了 + 
-幸会 -我来付画款 + 
她先保管六个月 然后再卖回给我 + 
我家才有宽敞的阁楼 和整面空旷的白墙壁 + 
你瞧那幅画，我好兴奋 + 
不好意思 对了，你的普拉达鞋很好看 + 
谢了 + 
权力女同志和她们穿的鞋 好比股票经纪和他们抽的雪茄 + 
爱丽丝对你夸赞不已 你从事艺术品买卖多久了？ + 
十年…不，十二年了 在这家画廊待了快五年 + 
-你在哪儿工作？ -我是华纳唱片的副总裁 + 
-你们在一起多久了？ -以前的事了，现在只是朋友 + 
真酷 + 
要不要和玛莉莎 及珠儿喝一杯？ + 
好，你要不要跟我们一起去？ + 
-我很想去，可是… -可是什么？ + 
夏绿蒂想不出 一个拒绝的好理由 + 
我很乐意去 + 
在纽约最热门的女同志酒吧 “G点”喝一杯之后 + 
她们又去“路克”吃晚饭 席间妙语如珠 + 
那是一家法式餐厅 主厨也是热情的女同志 + 
之后的深夜热舞 让夏绿蒂重温往日的快乐 + 
这是一趟解放之旅 来到一个不同的世界 + 
可以彻底把男人抛在脑后 + 
那晚 她结识了一些很棒的新朋友 + 
米兰达这一夜筋疲力尽 + 
她和伊森花了四个小时 + 
观赏经典纪录片“大屠杀” + 
“大屠杀”比那部虚伪做作的 “辛德勒的名单”好多了 + 
叙事电影根本别想碰触 历史的惨痛 + 
只有纪录片才能捕捉真实 + 
叙事电影的整个概念 不过是狗屁… + 
要不要去我家？ + 
米兰达发现伊森在床上 + 
与他对非叙事电影一样热情 + 
当他们正要办事时 她意识到他们并不孤单 + 
-那是干嘛？ -可以助兴 + 
我觉得挺性感的 你不觉得吗？ + 
也许吧 + 
伊森对电影的狂热 呈现出一个很有意思的癖好 + 
半夜看完了纪录片 “变调摇滚乐” + 
米兰达发现 伊森的新朋友实在难以摆脱 + 
需要开着吗？ + 
-那真的让我性致勃勃 -有了我还不够吗？ + 
你很棒，若你觉得受到干扰 我可以关掉声音 + 
你能把头往右移吗？ + 
那晚在大人物的厨房 我展现了难得一见的技艺 + 
我下厨做菜 + 
来了，火锅上桌 + 
-你只是加热起司 -还有把面包撕成一小块 + 
你的努力真让我感动 + 
这是我唯一擅长的菜 + 
好了，现在… + 
告诉我你喜欢吃 + 
美味极了 + 
换你了 + 
-好难吃 -现在可以去餐厅吃饭了吗？ + 
我收回那句话 你是个很棒的厨子 + 
我还没跟我朋友说 我们又开始约会 + 
-我也没说 -你根本没朋友 + 
-我有生意上的伙伴 -你为何不告诉他们？ + 
-我觉得你不希望我说 -才怪 + 
你要我说什么？ + 
-没什么 -很好，那就保密吧 + 
-你为什么想保密？ -我只是迎合你 + 
我不知道为什么想把和大人物 重新交往的事瞒得那么紧 + 
那似乎是不正当的 我甚至不想在他家过夜 + 
那天早上七点 当我慢慢走回公寓时… + 
-凯莉？ -米兰达，天啊… + 
你怎么会在这里？ + 
-我去洗牙 -在早上七点？ + 
我想赶快解决这件事 伊森还好吗？ + 
除了他沉溺于色情片之外？ + 
起初是很吸引人，但他越来越 过分，老说把头移开… + 
你不觉得真枪实弹 比看录影带刺激多了 + 
也许这只是习惯使然 + 
我觉得他对影片中的 女主角更有兴趣 + 
那感觉就好像 他在我们做爱时对我不忠 + 
-是我要求太多吗？ -你值得他全心全意的对待 + 
谢谢，我得走了 八点要开早餐会 + 
-你看牙医穿得太隆重了吧 -衣服送洗了 + 
-明白 -再见，亲爱的 + 
我觉得自己很恶劣 我从未向米兰达撒谎 + 
但我不好意思承认 和大人物见面的事 + 
我跟大人物 一起欺骗了她和所有朋友 + 
当天下午，莎曼珊和她新的 健身教练索尔关系更加密切 + 
我敢说你一定跟每个学员上床 + 
我没有 但这一直都是我的幻想 + 
-也许我可以训练你 -我们先去淋浴吧 + 
-你的腿好美 -早知道我就会刮毛 + 
我帮你刮 + 
你是个坏女孩吗？ + 
那要看你对坏的定义为何 + 
接着，让莎曼珊又惊又喜的是 + 
索尔的手并没有停下来 + 
男人为什么会想帮你刮阴毛？ + 
他们对小女孩有憧憬 + 
索尔这么做 比较像是在我身上烙印 + 
什么意思？ + 
他把那里修剪成闪电状 + 
你从哪里认识这些男人？ 凯莉，你有没有听到？ + 
莎曼珊的教练 帮她把阴毛修成闪电状 + 
很有创意 有点像是用X做记号 + 
那地方常常被忽略 但现在人们开始注意它了 + 
你再也不能任由那里杂草丛生 修整阴毛的生意商机无限 + 
这跟你穿什么鞋子一样 代表着个人风格 + 
恭喜 你找到一个很有天分的设计师 + 
凯莉，你在里面干嘛？ + 
帮我开一下门好吗？ + 
抱歉，我迟到了 + 
跟我们出去不用这么盛装吧 + 
有何不可？你也除毛了 + 
这不是为了你们 我要和莉蒂亚还有她朋友见面 + 
-谁是莉蒂亚？ -夏绿蒂是同性恋 + 
我才不是 我只是交了一些女同志朋友 + 
这礼拜她已经和她们 出去三次了 + 
她们都很酷，而且生活 不会被男人搞得那么复杂 + 
我四年级时是同性恋 + 
和温蒂克斯顿 我们接吻，感觉很好 + 
她们知道你爱的是男人吗？ + 
我肯定她们知道，我们甚至 不谈论性爱，这不是问题 + 
你得跟她们说清楚 否则就是在误导她们 + 
你只是心血来潮客串一下 + 
难道异性恋者 不能和女同志做朋友吗？ + 
当然可以，但你不能到了 神力女超人世界却不入境随俗 + 
-凯莉呢？ -我们快赶不上电影了 + 
你在厕所里还好吗？ + 
老实说，不好，我需要帮忙 + 
我新装的避孕器卡住了 + 
-卡在里面多久了？ -自从昨天晚上 + 
早上你说去洗牙… + 
现在我不是去妇产科挂急诊 + 
-就是你们其中一个进来帮我 -我的手不怎么灵巧 + 
你是同性恋，你去 + 
不要 + 
我来 + 
我才刚做完指甲 + 
你非请我吃晚餐不可 + 
等等，你跟谁上床？ + 
是从几个星期前开始的 + 
我没有告诉你们 不过…是大人物 + 
-你跟大人物上床？ -他对你那么差劲 + 
不尽然如此 + 
-也许有时候… -你凭什么认为这次会不同？ + 
我不知道，但情况似乎有改善 + 
那你何必瞒着我们？ + 
我们在肉体和心灵上 都很有默契 + 
这是很难说断就断的 你们饶了我吧 + 
-所以这只是偶然的性关系？ -也许 + 
就连我都没这么天真 + 
我没心情看电影了 + 
-凯莉 -别这样… + 
那晚我彻夜未眠 + 
我的朋友说得对 + 
和大人物陷入这种 前途茫茫的关系中 + 
我突然觉得大错特错 + 
夏绿蒂去派蒂艾斯顿的家 参加早午餐聚会 + 
她的前夫是一位电视制作人 + 
如果权力女同志是曼哈顿 最时髦的社交族群 + 
夏绿蒂即将和她们的女王见面 + 
派蒂棒呆了，她是一百个慈善 团体的董事，还去上飞行课程 + 
我们复活节要去她泰莱德的 别墅玩，你也应该一起来 + 
我很乐意 她的收藏也很不同凡响 + 
狩猎女神黛安娜 我在拍卖会上买的 + 
派蒂，她就是夏绿蒂 + 
我已经久仰大名 + 
我刚和夏绿蒂 聊到你在泰莱德的别墅 + 
-听起来很棒 -我去拿饮料，香槟好吗？ + 
-你会滑雪吗？ -会，但滑得不好 + 
我就像所谓的小雪兔 老是蹦蹦跳跳摔个四脚朝天 + 
这不是最重要的 置身山林的感觉非常舒服 + 
一点也没错 + 
下次你应该加入我们 莉蒂亚一定会很高兴 + 
你真慷慨 + 
不过首先大家都很想知道 你是同志吗？ + 
我不是，但我非常享受 跟你们相处的时光 + 
每个人都既聪明又风趣 + 
在男人身上花太多注意力之后 + 
这里是一个安全、温馨的环境 + 
虽然性向上我爱的是男人 + 
但有一部分的我 和女性精神是紧密连结的 + 
这些都很好 + 
但若你不和女人上床 你便不是同志 + 
经过索尔的魔鬼训练之后 + 
莎曼珊决定来个放松的蒸气浴 + 
那个混帐 + 
莎曼珊发现 闪电的确会出现两次 + 
米兰达则得欣赏两出戏码 + 
在艾莉丝杜利厅看完 “北方的南努克” + 
然后是伊森色情片皇宫放映的 “高潮迭起” + 
停在那儿别动 + 
够了，这可不是同步转播 + 
听着，我喜欢你 但这越来越荒谬了 + 
不是A片女郎就是我 你只能选一个 + 
米兰达，这没那么简单 我只认识你几星期 + 
而她们已经陪伴我好几年了 + 
我真的要走了 + 
当晚，大人物第一次 带我去跳舞 + 
仿佛他想让谈话 尽可能变得困难 + 
我们互相强烈地吸引 但我知道我得更进一步 + 
这表示我们正式复合了吗？ + 
-如果你要这么说的话 -这种回答令人很火大 + 
我不知道何谓正式 + 
正式就是…正式 + 
你知道，就是来真的 + 
我生命中每一刻 都是来真的，宝贝 + 
只要回答我这个问题 我们为什么分手？ + 
应该你告诉我 是你把我一个人丢在街上不管 + 
你不肯说我想听的话 + 
-是吗？ -不只如此 + 
我想告诉他我害怕他永远不会 如我希望的那样爱我 + 
我害怕他除了自己谁也不爱 + 
我害怕他会再次伤我的心 + 
但我只轻描淡写地说了一句… 我害怕 + 
我可以告诉你一件事 我真的很想你 + 
正式地想你 + 
你有没有哭？ + 
没有，不过我倒是听了一堆 法兰克辛纳屈的歌 + 
就这样，我想我们正式复合了 + 
不管那是什么意思 +
