Everyone has a worst nightmare. +
For some, it's bathing suit season. +
For others, it's knowing your birth certificate +
can never be legally destroyed. +
For Miranda, +
it was family hour at her gym. +
Hey! What the--? +
Kiddie Jazzercise, +
aerobics room one, +
five minutes. +
On Sundays, her whole neighborhood +
became occupied territory, under siege to children. +
They were everywhere. Movie theaters, restaurants, bookstores, hair salons... +
Starbucks was basically a stroller parking lot. +
Was it too much to hope for one small space to call her own? +
Uh, don't touch it, don't touch it. Please? +
Is there a problem? +
No, no, it's just that he really likes to push the button. +
Okay, fine, I'm in kind of a rush. Push one? +
Ah, Simon, see? This very pretty lady +
said that you could push the button. +
Ah! +
Oh! +
So sorry. +
I'm sure it's just a phase. +
Mm, yeah. The guilty, overindulgent phase of a d-i-v-o-r-c-e. +
Ah. +
Daddy. +
Simon, we're not being very nice to, um... +
Miranda. +
Sounds kind of like a princess name, doesn't it? +
Stop talking. +
I'm going to bite you. +
Do you want to go to the toy store later? +
Yes. +
Well, then, don't bite me. +
See, I'm in violation of every parenting book ever written. +
Hm. +
-Do you have kids? -Uh, no. +
Married? +
-Well, here we are! -At last! +
Any chance I could persuade you to take another ride? +
His name was Roger Cobb, +
and it only took him another floor and a half +
to ask Miranda for her phone number. +
The whole thing might have been very romantic +
if Simon hadn't peed in his pants. +
I don't wear vintage clothes, +
I hate flea markets, I don't collect antiques, +
is it too much to ask that he not be... +
-I don't know. Used? -Okay, before it goes any further, +
just make sure his parts are still under warranty. +
It's like chewing somebody else's gum. +
Well, divorced men do come with baggage. +
Yeah, baggage is one thing. But when they come with kids... +
Especially kids with bladder control issues. +
-Here's what I think. -Mm-hm? +
Round up all the divorced men and keep them in a pound. +
That way, you get their whole history before you take one home. +
Just because a man is divorced doesn't mean he has a problem. +
Like my brother Wesley. +
He's just separated from his wife, Leslie, +
-and he is-- -Eh! +
Wesley and Leslie? +
-I don't think so. -What is that? +
Marriage by Mother Goose? +
-Definitely a candidate for the pound. -Mm. +
Okay, I was going to ask you all to meet him because he's coming +
to visit me. And now, forget it. +
No, no, no, honey, we want to meet Wesley of Wesley and Leslie. +
And, P. S., does he work for Nestlé? +
My brother's very important to me, +
and I'm not going to have him subjected +
to scrutiny and ridicule. +
I'll be scrutiny. +
-You'll be ridicule. -I always have to be ridicule. +
Why can't you be ridicule for once? +
I know. +
As for me, rather than sort through the half-off bin, +
I was dating someone brand spanking new. +
I met Vaughn Weisel at a PEN luncheon a month ago. +
It's amazing how much better looking +
fiction writers have become. +
Still up for a movie? +
Yeah, I just gotta drop these books by my parents' place. +
It's on the way. +
Hey, eh, GQ called. +
Really? They want you to write something? +
No, they want me to wear something. +
It's so great to be a writer these days. +
There's just so little writing involved. +
Just don't be photographed in anything sleeveless. +
No one who went sleeveless ever won a Pulitzer. +
It's just a little tip from me to you. +
Hey, wow, nice townhouse! +
-Come on in, this will only take a sec. -Oh, no, no. Oh, God. +
No, I'm really-- I'm not dressed for family. +
Can you just maybe drop them through the mail slot? +
If I'm here and I don't at least say hello, you know... +
I'm looking at two months minimum hard family time. +
Alright, alright. Yeah, okay. +
Oof. +
Thank you. +
Mother, I swear, you're the only person who can kill a cactus. +
-Hey, Vaughn. -Uh, Zoey, this is Carrie. +
Tell your sister to stop bringing me plants. +
They get suicidal around me. +
I have to talk them down from the ledge. +
-Vaughn! -Those books you asked me to sign. +
-Oh, great, dear! -Yeah. +
-Duncan, Vaughn's here! -Yeah, and he brought a girl! +
Well, hi. +
-Wallis Weisel. -Hi. +
Say, have we met? +
No, no, I don't think so. Carrie Bradshaw. +
Oh, my God! +
Duncan, get your ass in here! +
I just love, love, love your column. +
Oh, well... +
I love, love, love to hear that. +
Oh, Mom, we can't stay. +
The hell you can't! You know what you should write about? +
Re-virginization. +
Did you know that there are women who are actually having +
their vaginas restitched to make them like new again? +
-Well, aren't they clever? -In case you're wondering, +
Mom just finished making a documentary +
on genital mutilation. +
Which I still haven't gotten your notes on. +
Mom, I told you, +
I can't bring myself to look at that fucking thing. +
And I typed all his short stories for him when he was 12. +
Duncan, look. Do you know who this is? +
Carrie Bradshaw. She writes that column we love. +
What are you doing Thursday night? +
Um... laundry. +
I teach a seminar at Columbia on cultural zeitgeist. +
I'd love to have you come speak. +
Mr. Self-Involved here didn't tell us he was dating an icon. +
Icon? +
Oh, you are an icon. You are. +
Hey, who brought a girl? +
Oh, this is my other sister. +
-Franny, uh, this is Carrie. -Hey, what's up? +
Hey, what's up? +
-Hey, Mom. -Hi, sweetie. +
Franny and Zoey? +
What can I say? +
J. D. Salinger used to get me high. +
And then she'd call me at 3:00 a.m., +
"I love you, I love you." +
Good for you, Vaughn. +
Beautiful and she thinks I'm funny. +
You're hilarious. +
Put your tongue back in your head, +
and the lox on the table, please. +
Come on, everybody, let's... +
-have something to eat. Come on! Yeah. +
Look, we-- We have to go. +
-Oh, you don't. -What? +
-Why? -Oh, come on, please! +
Sweetie, we can-- We'll stay. +
Great! Oh, good, thank you! +
I mean, really, within the space of five minutes, +
I had next week's column, +
an invitation to speak at an Ivy League university, +
and access to the entire Zabar's fish counter. +
Leave now? Was he nuts? +
Have a napkin. +
So, have you ever gone out with someone who had a kid? +
No, but I've never gone out with someone I met +
-on an elevator either, so... -Well, that's a first for me, too. +
There was a woman I met on an escalator once, but it didn't last long. +
It was over by the time we got to ladies' lingerie. +
I dated a man once who wore ladies' lingerie. +
That was kind of the problem there. +
I'm kidding. +
Cause I'm wearing panties now. +
You're kidding, right? +
Yah! -Ow! +
Daddy, look what I found! +
-Can you say you're sorry? -No! +
-No, no, no! -Are you okay? +
Ah... +
Fortunately, I mostly use the right side of my brain. +
It must be hard, having a social life as a single parent. +
Well, yeah, it is. I got to buy protective helmets for all my dates. +
Yeah! Where's mine by the way? +
Oh, truth is, I... +
I never really had a great social life before Simon either. +
I'm just one of those weird male aberrations who... +
prefers to be married. +
I mean, I like stability, I like routine. +
I like knowing there's people waiting for me at home. +
I guess that makes me sound pretty dull. +
Are you kidding? +
You're the heterosexual holy grail. +
Miranda began to wonder how a vintage man +
might look on her modern couch. +
Here, here, here, here. +
-Oh! -Ah! +
Thank you! +
Probably not the best time to ask you to dinner, huh? +
While Miranda was dealing with queasiness, +
Charlotte was handling depression. +
Which, of course, she felt could be solved with a homemade muffin. +
There you go! Just like Nana used to make. +
Charlie, the muffins are great. +
But I'd much prefer a nice dry Martini. +
But Nana always made muffins to cheer you up. +
Well, that was pre-Leslie. +
Post-Leslie, I need a cocktail. Now, where's your vodka? +
I don't have any. +
And you call yourself a wasp. +
I don't see why you two can't work it out, +
you had the most beautiful wedding. +
And we're going to have an even lovelier divorce. +
I can't believe you're willing to just throw it all away so easily. +
I mean, relationships take work. +
You need patience and understanding. +
Charlotte, +
when was your last long-term relationship? +
Oh, just eat your muffin. +
The afternoon had been like six hours of foreplay. +
Ow! +
Some men seduce with dim lights and soft music, +
Vaughn seduced with chocolate chip cookies and relatives. +
It was inevitable this would happen. +
I just didn't know it would happen so quickly. +
Uh... +
Um, I'll get a tissue. +
Get out now, before he stains all your sheets. +
Oh, come on, that's harsh. +
It could be he was just nervous. +
The first time is always weird. +
And he'd probably had something to drink. +
And we'd just spent the whole day with his family. +
Look, the guy could not get his Cadillac into the garage. +
Honey, I'm sorry, I hate being right about this. +
Samantha was the General Patton of sex. +
She didn't like sending her troops into battle +
if she thought they would lose. +
-I like him. -Well, that's real swell, +
but it still doesn't get the cream in the cupcake. +
But the thing I like best about him is his family. +
Mm, anyone there you can fuck? +
What? I'm trying to be helpful. +
I'm telling you, this family is like... +
They've got charisma! +
Like Tom Cruise, they're the Tom Cruise of families. +
I'm pretty sure the family is supposed to be the obstacle +
to a relationship, not the attraction. +
I fucked a guy once because his family had a pool. +
He was pretty much of a nerd, but, +
I'd go over there and get all cocoa-buttered up. +
His mom loved me. +
She was always serving me Kool-aid and chips. +
-Kool-aid? -Mm, yeah! +
Kool-aid! I was 13 and, honey, +
you should've seen my tan. +
In my mind, the complications of making a relationship work +
had just expanded exponentially. +
When you date someone, +
how many people become emotionally involved? +
When you sleep with someone, are you screwing the family? +
While I was still on the fence about my feelings for Vaughn, +
I had no doubt about my feeling for his mother. +
I was in love with her. +
Then we were in Nicaragua... +
with the Peace Corps. That's where Vaughn was born. +
I can't get over it! You've had, like, five lives. +
I can barely make one happen. +
Oh, don't pull that self-effacing shit with me, Carrie. +
I see you. I know what you've got going. +
What? What do I do? +
-I write this little column. -It's a contribution. +
I mean, you are putting it out there. You... +
You're part of a dialogue. +
I mean, if it wasn't for you, we wouldn't know half the things we do +
about other people's sex lives. +
Well, thanks a lot. +
I'm teasing. +
Oh! +
No, no. It's wonderful to be frank and honest about sex. +
That's how I raised my kids. I mean, +
sex was always a part of the discussion. +
When they were two years old, they knew the proper names +
for their body parts. +
None of this pee-pee and wee-wee crap, no, no. +
And as result, you know, +
they can talk to me about anything. +
When Franny told me she was a lesbian, I said, +
"Great, just as long as you're not a republican." +
May I just say, +
I like you very much. +
Oh, that's dear, thank you. +
So, did you talk to Leslie today? +
No, but I talked to her lawyer. +
Do you want to know all about that? +
I'm giving her the house and she's giving me an ulcer. +
Okay, okay, I'm sorry I brought it up. +
Tonight we'll have fun. +
You'll finally meet my friend Carrie, +
we'll go out, have dinner, maybe we'll go to a club-- +
Shit. +
-Hi. -Hello. +
Carrie, Samantha, +
this is my wonderful brother, Wesley. +
-Hi. -Nice to meet you. +
Oh, good looks run in the family. +
Can I get you ladies a drink? +
-Cosmopolitan. -Ditto. +
So, how are you enjoying New York? +
Excuse us. +
Why is she here? +
Oh, um... +
That's our friend. I believe you remember Samantha? +
But... +
I mean, you know how she gets. Like, look! +
She's doing it already. +
What? They're talking. +
Hey. +
-Thank you. -Samantha says +
there's a great jazz bar that we should go to. +
Oh, I, I... +
I just don't think I'm up for it tonight. +
Well, then maybe we'll just go. +
Talking and going to hear jazz. +
I think I have your son's slinky embedded in my back. +
Well, I like to brand my women. +
I'm going to use the bathroom, and then I really will go. +
-Daddy? -No, Simon! +
Ow! Daddy! +
Simon? -Shit. +
I'm sorry, I was peeing and I didn't want him to see me. +
I was afraid he'd see me and the next thing you know, +
he'd be drawing pictures for a child psychologist +
and then nobody's happy, right? +
I'll get a Band-Aid, huh? +
He's hurt. I think he might need a stitch. +
I'll go with you to the emergency room. +
No! +
Just go. +
Please. +
Just... +
go. +
One thing about families. +
If no one's sorry to see you go, +
then you're probably not coming back. +
The next morning, Charlotte was in for a rude awakening. +
Oh, honey, where do you keep your coffee filters? +
Uh... +
Just tell me if I'm warm. +
My brother? +
You slept with my brother? +
Oh, honey, +
what a doll. I mean, he really-- +
Is your vagina in the New York City guidebooks? +
Because it should be, it's the hottest spot in town! +
It's always open! +
What's going on? +
What did you say? +
She was in my kitchen, she was wearing your shirt, I... +
I snapped. +
Who asked you to butt your nose into my-- +
Samantha, wait! +
Samantha, don't go! +
Wesley! +
I didn't know your mom was nominated for an Oscar. +
Mm-hm. Best documentary short. +
I just love that she still has so many ambitions for herself. +
I'm not really in the mood to talk about my mom. +
I'm not really in the mood to talk at all. +
Uh! Don't touch it. Don't touch it! +
So, +
what was the documentary short about, anyway? +
Oh, good, you're back. +
Charlotte, I swear to God, if you hand me a muffin, +
-I'm out of here. -Honey, +
you don't know Samantha. +
I do. She has so many notches on her bedpost, +
it's practically whittled down to a toothpick. +
It was fun. +
I know, I know, you had your little fling and... +
Now you can go back to Leslie and you can work it out, right? +
We're not working it out. +
You think you know Wesley and Leslie? +
Let me tell you about Wesley and Leslie. +
Leslie's frigid. +
And before last night, Wesley hadn't gotten laid +
in two years. +
Oh, my God. +
I think I was going out of my mind. +
I've seen a pastor, I've seen a shrink. +
But until I saw Samantha, I didn't realize what I really needed. +
Sex. +
So, it was a good thing. +
It was a freaking great thing. +
That Samantha... +
You've really got a good friend there. +
It's Charlotte. +
That was a terrible thing I said. +
Yes, it was. +
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have another tour group +
coming through my vagina in ten minutes. +
And I'm so sorry. +
You said what you came to say? +
Wait! +
I wanted to give you this. +
Samantha was touched. +
-Come here. -Oh... +
She realized this was Charlotte's way of saying, +
"Thank you for fucking my brother." +
-Get in there. -Ah! +
Hey, kids, Funtastics on three. +
And Miranda decided she had ceded enough territory +
to the invading troops. +
Oh, do you mind? He really loves to push the button. +
Yeah? +
So do I. +
That is so sexy, +
you in bed, +
with my book. +
It's really great. +
Aw! +
Do that again. +
What? Turn the page? +
Oh, baby. +
Again. +
Okay, wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop. +
Let's just take this nice and slow. +
And you tell me if you're feeling too excited +
and we'll take a little break. +
Why? +
Because I think we both really want this to work. +
I mean... +
I love that you get so turned on by me, +
and I am very turned on by you and... +
maybe we've just been in too much of a rush. +
Okay. +
Forget it. +
No, I don't want to forget it. Hey, come here. +
-Let's talk about it. -No! +
I don't want to talk about it. +
Well, I think we have to. +
Why does everything have to be about sex! +
I am so sick of talking about sex. +
I've been talking about it since I was two! +
So, let's go. +
My parents are expecting us. +
Duncan and I went down to the Neil Simon Theatre +
-and spent 65 dollars-- -Seventy-five. +
To see a British movie star simulate a blow job. +
I wonder if that's what Neil had in mind. +
Did she show her tits? +
No. +
How's the pickled herring? +
It's very good. +
Franny tells me that you two are going camping this weekend. +
Where's the scallion cream cheese? +
Oh, it's out there on the table. +
I don't see it. +
Well, then check the refrigerator. +
Why is he so edgy? +
I have no idea. +
Don't let him pull that moody shit on you. +
I know, it's such a pose. +
The minute he got published, he's suddenly this quote, +
"tortured artist." +
Where's the cream cheese? +
It's out there. +
What's the point of buying all this shit +
if you can't remember the one fucking thing +
that holds it all together? +
Vaughn, +
let's deal with what's really upsetting you. +
Hm, shall we? +
Okay. +
If you have to have everything out on the table, +
why don't we start with some scallion cream cheese? +
Jenna and I looked at each other +
like two foreigners without visas. +
Well, I'm... +
You know what, I think I'd better go. +
I, um... +
I've got a deadline. +
So, yeah. I'll go. +
Uh... +
Thank you for lunch, for everything. +
Uh, Carrie! +
What happened? Everything was going so well. +
It really wasn't. +
Okay, I know what it is. +
His last girlfriend wasn't as discreet. +
I don't even want to get in the irony. +
He writes short stories. +
Okay, this has... +
This has officially become too weird. +
Really? In a situation like this, you gotta laugh. +
Alright, it's a problem. +
But, +
you'll work it out. +
He... +
He won't even talk about it. +
-You want me to talk to him? -No, no, no. +
I can't discuss this with you. +
You can't? +
Carrie, you and I can discuss anything. +
So your sex life isn't so great. So what? +
Seventy-seven percent of all marriages are sexless. +
Other things are so much more important. +
Like family. +
Then I saw that the person I really had to break up with +
wasn't Vaughn. +
It was his mother. +
Wallis, I would still like us to be friends. +
No, I mean that. +
And what happens when you meet somebody else? +
I can tell you right now, they won't have a mother like me. +
And you know that. +
You know that we have something. +
What we have is very special. +
Alright, well... +
Alright. +
Call me sometime. +
-I will. -Sweetie. +
Wallis was right. +
The most important thing in life is your family. +
There are days you love them and others you don't, +
but in the end, they're the people you always come home to. +
Sometimes it's the family you're born into. +
And sometimes, it's the one you make for yourself. +
-Carrie! -Hey! +
-What are you doing here? +
-Hey! -Come here! +

你最近一次最长的关系 是什么时候？ +
吃你的松饼吧 +
那个下午就像历时 六小时的前戏 +
有些男人用烛光和轻音乐 引诱女人 +
方恩用饼干和家人引诱我 +
发生这种事无可避免 +
我只是没料到会这么快 +
我去拿面纸 +
在他弄脏你床单之前甩了他 +
-或许他很紧张 -第一次总是很奇怪 +
-可能是喝酒的关系 -我们整天跟他的家人在一起 +
那家伙的车开不进车库 真讨厌被我说中 +
没有胜算的话 莎曼珊不随便派兵 +
我喜欢他 +
他们不会在杯子蛋糕加奶油 +
-我最喜欢他的家人 -有可以上床的人选吗？ +
我试着帮你忙 +
他的家人…很有魅力 +
就像汤姆克鲁斯 +
家人应该是一段感情的阻碍 不是吸引 +
我曾因为某人家有游泳池 跟他上床，结果他是个笨蛋 +
我会到他家帮忙打奶泡 他妈妈爱死我了 +
-她拿多果汁给我喝 -多果汁？ +
我当时十三岁 你应该看看我古铜色的皮肤 +
成功经营一段感情是不容易的 +
现在以指数方式持续复杂化 +
当你跟某人约会时 有多少人在感情上受到影响？ +
当你跟某人上床 是不是等于跟他全家做爱？ +
在我还不确定 我对方恩的感觉时 +
我确定我喜欢他的母亲 我爱她 +
我们当时在尼加拉瓜 参加和平部队 +
-方恩就是在那里出生的 -你救了五条生命 +
我不可能做得到 +
不要轻视你自己 我知道你会有所作为 +
我能做什么？ 我不过写个小专栏 +
那就是贡献，你写文章 +
你是对话的一部分 +
要不是你，我们就不会知道 其他人的性生活 +
-非常谢谢你 -我在取笑你 +
能这样诚实地谈论性真的很棒 +
我就是这样养育小孩的 性教育是我们的话题之一 +
两岁时，他们就知道 身体各器官的正确名称 +
从来没有什么小鸡鸡小鸭鸭的 +
所以，他们可以跟我说任何事 +
当弗兰尼跟我说她是同性恋 +
我说：很好 只要你不是共和党员 +
我可不可以说我很喜欢你？ +
你真是个甜心，谢谢你 +
-你有跟蕾丝李说话吗？ -没有，我跟她律师谈过 +
我要把房子给她 她却给我胃溃痬 +
很抱歉我又提起 +
今晚我们来放松 凯莉会过来吃晚餐… +
可恶 +
凯莉，莎曼珊… +
这是我的好弟弟，卫斯理 +
-很高兴见到你 -你们家族都长得很好看 +
-你们女士要喝点什么？ -四海为家 +
-你喜欢纽约吗？ -容我们私下谈一下 +
她为什么在这里？ +
那是我们的朋友 你还记得莎曼珊吧？ +
你知道她那副德行 她已经开始了 +
他们在说话 +
莎曼珊说有一个 很棒的爵士酒吧 +
我今晚没那个心情 +
我们就去吧 +
聊聊天，听听爵士乐 +
我的背后有你儿子的娃娃 +
我喜欢把我的女人贴标签 +
我去一下洗手间就走 +
-爸爸 -不要，赛门 +
-赛门 -可恶 +
抱歉，我在上厕所 不希望他看见我 +
我怕他会看见我 +
就不得不去看心理医生了 +
-我去拿OK绷 -他可能要缝针 +
我跟你去急诊室 +
你走吧 +
拜托，走吧 +
要是在一个家庭里 没有人在乎你是否离去 +
你或许不用再回来了 +
隔天早上夏绿蒂被吵醒 +
你咖啡滤纸放在哪里？告诉我 +
你跟我弟弟睡觉？ +
亲爱的，你真可爱 我是说，他真的很… +
你的阴道有没列入旅游书中？ +
那可是曼哈顿最热门的据点 而且全年开放 +
怎么了？ +
-你说什么？ -她穿你的衣服 +
-我突然间… -谁要你多管闲事… +
莎曼珊，不要走 +
我不知道你妈妈 得过奥斯卡提名 +
最佳短篇纪录片 +
我喜欢她这样胸怀抱负 +
我不想谈我妈妈 +
我根本不想聊天 +
不要碰它，不要碰 +
那部短篇纪录片有多“短”？ +
很好，你回来了 +
我发誓，要是你再给我松饼 我马上走人 +
你不了解莎曼珊 她的床柱使用过度 +
都快磨成绣花针了 +
很幽默 +
你玩也玩过了 +
现在可以回到蕾丝李身边 把事情解决 +
我们没有办法解决 你以为你知道我们的问题？ +
蕾丝李很严肃，昨晚以前 卫斯理已经两年没做过爱 +
-我的天 -我简直快疯了 +
我跟牧师谈过，看过心理医生 +
直到我遇见莎曼珊 我才知道我需要的是“性” +
-所以那是件好事 -是一件很棒的事 +
莎曼珊…真的是个好朋友 +
夏绿蒂 +
-我说的话很过分 -一点也没错 +
抱歉，还有一个旅行团 要到我的阴道参观 +
-我真的很抱歉 -你要说的都说了？ +
等一下 +
我要给你这个 +
-莎曼珊很感动 -过来 +
那是夏绿蒂向莎曼珊说： 谢谢你跟我弟弟上床 +
进来 +
小鬼，游乐室在三楼 +
米兰达觉得她不想再退让了 +
你介意吗？他喜欢按按钮 +
是吗？我也是 +
好性感 +
你跟我的书在床上 +
真的很棒 +
-再一次 -什么？翻页吗？ +
宝贝… +
再一次 +
等一下，停 +
我们慢慢地来 +
要是太兴奋就告诉我 我们可以休息一下 +
为什么？ +
因为我觉得我们都希望能成功 +
我是说… +
我喜欢你因我“性”致勃勃 +
我也因你热情如火 +
或许我们太急了 +
算了 +
我不想算了，过来 +
-我们来谈谈 -我不想谈 +
我们必须要谈 +
每件事都跟性有关 我不想再谈到性 +
我从两岁就开始谈论性 +
我们走吧，我爸妈在等我们 +
我们去看尼尔赛门的戏剧 +
-花了六十五块 -七十五 +
看一个英国演员假装口交 +
我不知道那是不是尼尔的原意 +
-她有露奶子吗？ -没有，腌鲱鱼好吃吗？ +
很棒 +
弗兰尼说你们周末要去露营 +
-奶油起司在哪里？ -在桌子那边 +
-我没看到 -看冰箱里有没有 +
-他为什么这么急躁？ -我不知道 +
不要让他的情绪化影响你 +
只要他一出书 就会变成痛苦的艺术家 +
-奶油起司在哪里？ -在外面 +
要是不知道东西放在哪 何必买这么多鬼东西？ +
方恩，我们来解决 让你烦心的事，好吗？ +
如果你希望把东西都拿到桌上 +
可以先拿青葱奶油起司 +
珍纳和我相视 就像两个没有签证的外国人 +
我得走了 +
我要赶稿子 +
我要走了 谢谢你的午餐和一切 +
发生了什么事？一切都很好 +
-不，不好 -我知道是怎么回事 +
他的前女友没有这么谨慎 他写短篇故事 +
这下子真的变得太奇怪 +
在这种情况下，只能傻笑 +
好吧，那是个问题 不过你们一定能解决 +
他根本不愿意谈 +
-你要我跟他说吗？ -不要 +
我没有办法跟你谈这个 +
你跟我什么都可以谈 +
你的性生活不美满又怎样？ 有七成的婚姻都是无性的 +
其他的事更重要，例如家庭 +
我发现我要分手的不是方恩 +
而是他的母亲 +
我希望我们还是朋友，说真的 +
要是你遇见别的人呢？ +
他们不会有我这样的母亲 +
你知道我们是独一无二的 +
好吧，那么… +
-有时间打给我 -我会的 +
亲爱的 +
华莉丝说的对 生命中最重要的是你的家人 +
有时候你爱他们 有时候则不然 +
但他们永远是你的依靠 +
有时候是你出生的那个家庭 +
有时候是你自己组的家庭 +
你在那里做什么？ +
