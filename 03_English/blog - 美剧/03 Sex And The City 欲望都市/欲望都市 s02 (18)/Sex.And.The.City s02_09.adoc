They say that the women in New York + 
are the most beautiful women in the world. + 
Which explains why men in New York + 
spend all their time looking at them. + 
The city is a veritable playground for men's roving eyes. + 
Unfortunately, they need both of them + 
looking straight ahead to survive. + 
Oh... hey! + 
This New York woman was pretty happy. + 
I was seeing Big again. + 
Unfortunately, my New York guy + 
was still seeing other women. + 
If checking out other women is the biggest problem + 
you're having with him, you're lucky. + 
Well, if it's that small, he should be able to stop. + 
Oh, honey, you can't change that about a man. + 
It's part of their genetic code, like farting. + 
Oh, please, you're gonna put me off my pretzel. + 
You have to take Big the way he is. + 
Once you start to try to change a man, it's doomed, + 
they won't budge an inch. + 
Well, I know, but you can... + 
subtly manipulate and cajole. + 
The only things you can work with are hair and wardrobe, + 
but even then, it's a constant battle. + 
I already like the hair and wardrobe. + 
Then be happy. + 
Honey, no man is perfect. + 
I'm not asking for perfection, I'm just looking for, uh... + 
slight alterations. + 
Oh, be careful with alterations. + 
If you pull the wrong thread, everything falls apart. + 
While Samantha and I discussed the theory of change, + 
Miranda was going through it for real. + 
She had a new apartment, a new boyfriend... + 
And a new dating schedule that was killing her. + 
Hey, I'm sorry. + 
I thought we'd be closing the bar earlier. + 
Oh, jeez, you were asleep. + 
No, no, I'm up, hi. + 
Come on in. + 
-Ow! Ow! -Oh! + 
-Come here, you okay? -Ow, ow. + 
-Let's see. -Ah! + 
Ow! + 
Is that better? + 
That's better, thank you. + 
So, how was your night? + 
I don't know, I was asleep. + 
I'm sorry I was late. + 
I thought we were gonna close the bar around two. + 
Then we got this big group of Japanese bankers came in. + 
And all they want is these big flaming drinks. + 
And then one of them got sick and then... + 
Never mind. + 
Everything was great about Steve, except for one thing. + 
-Mmm! Mmm! + 
Morning. + 
Come here! + 
-Uh-- -Come here, come here, come here. + 
They had completely opposite schedules. + 
Steve had all the time in the world in the mornings. + 
Miranda got right up at seven. + 
Unfortunately, Steve did too. + 
I have to go to work. + 
Not yet. + 
The only thing Miranda liked inside her in the mornings + 
was the cup of take-out coffee she drank on the way to the subway. + 
That night, in a bed across town, + 
Charlotte was seeing a lot of Mike, + 
a cute but feared restaurant critic + 
famous for his patented five-whisk rating system. + 
Mike? + 
Yeah? + 
Let's make love. + 
Charlotte... + 
Charlotte, you are a five-whisk woman. + 
But just when Charlotte had become comfortable with the penis, + 
she got a very unexpected surprise. + 
Oh... + 
You're... + 
It's... + 
Uncircumcised. + 
Is that okay? + 
No! + 
Sure. + 
Of course, it is. + 
It was not okay. + 
The only uncut version of anything Charlotte had ever seen + 
was the original Gone With The Wind. + 
There was so much skin, + 
it was like a Shar Pei! + 
You've never seen an uncircumcised one? + 
I'm from Connecticut! + 
Reminder, you're dating the guy, not the penis. + 
Aesthetics are important to me. + 
It's not what it looks like, it's what they can do with it. + 
Well, I don't need one that can make its own carrying case! + 
-Ha, ha, ha, ha! -Personally... + 
I love an uncircumcised dick. + 
It's like a tootsie pop. + 
Hard on the outside, + 
with a delicious surprise inside. + 
I don't like surprises. + 
I like it all out there where I can see it. + 
Same here, I'm sorry, it is not normal. + 
Well, actually, it is. Something like 85% of men aren't circumcised. + 
Great, now they're taking over the world! + 
Honey, it's a penis, not Godzilla. + 
Hey, if 85% aren't circumcised, + 
that means I've only slept with 15% of the population, tops! + 
Wow, you're practically a virgin. + 
You know, he's a nice, waspy guy. What went wrong? + 
Well, maybe his parents were hippies and they just didn't believe in it. + 
I am so circumcising my kids. + 
I think you can pay people to do that now. + 
I don't ever wanna know there's a woman out there + 
calling my son a Shar Pei. + 
All I'm saying is uncut men are the best. + 
They try harder. + 
I should know. + 
I've slept with five of them. + 
Out of how many? + 
Infinity. + 
That night, + 
Big and I went out to celebrate... + 
absolutely nothing. + 
More grappa ? + 
No, thank you. + 
Oh, listen, my editor called me today and she's... + 
Hm? + 
You were saying? + 
Yes, I was. + 
Excuse me, you can't smoke that in here. + 
Really? + 
You're absolutely positively sure about that? + 
Because, + 
I checked the zoning on this particular table, + 
and I'm pretty sure this table is in a cigar-friendly zone. + 
Well, I don't mind, but it's for the other patrons. + 
Oh, you mean, if those five patrons don't mind, it's okay with you? + 
-Sir, I'm gonna have to... -Just one second. + 
Excuse me, this is my last day on earth. + 
I'm being executed tomorrow morning. + 
Um, that's my parole officer there. + 
Would you mind terribly if I smoked this, ladies? + 
No. + 
Thank you. + 
Excuse me, I'm sorry. + 
Would it be okay if I smoked this? + 
And, please, let me + 
I'd like to buy everybody a round of drinks. + 
Apparently, + 
the other patrons aren't bothered at all. + 
I didn't have the guts to tell Big that he was actually + 
kind of bothering me. + 
Well, it's not like they're gonna tell you the truth. + 
No one is gonna say to your face they hate your cigar. + 
Good. + 
You are very arrogant. + 
I thought that's what you liked about me. + 
Maybe Big was right. + 
Maybe we were at that inevitable point in the relationship + 
when all those little things you love about the other person become... + 
huge liabilities. + 
And just then... + 
...a huge liability walked by. + 
Hey! + 
What? + 
I... + 
I... hate that cigar. + 
And you told me right to my face. + 
New York City is all about change. + 
New yorkers change their haircuts, their politics, + 
even their friends in the blink of an eye. + 
If change was so easy, why was it so hard for Big? + 
Was I banging my head against the wall + 
thinking I could get him to stop and notice me? + 
Did I have to change my expectations, or was it possible... + 
Can you change a man? + 
My husband used to be obsessed with watching sports + 
twenty-four hours a day. + 
Then I started fooling around with his best friend. + 
And now he's obsessed with watching me. + 
Every girlfriend I've had wants me to change something. + 
Change your job, change your friends, change your attitude. + 
The only thing I ever change... + 
is girlfriends. + 
No. + 
Meanwhile, Charlotte was about to discover + 
that some men can change. + 
Thanks for dinner, it was great. + 
So, uh... + 
-Can I come upstairs with you? -Oh, jeez, uh... + 
I have to get up really early, + 
-and my place is just a mess. -Look, Charlotte, I... + 
I understand. + 
-You do? -Yeah, I mean... + 
What happened the other night, you're... + 
you're not the first woman to react to it that way. + 
I've gotten that most of my life. + 
-Really? -Yeah. + 
And I've decided to do something about it. + 
I've been uncomfortable for too long, so... + 
I'm getting circumcised. + 
Can you do that? + 
Well, yeah, I mean, it hurts, + 
it takes a long time to heal, but... + 
But I'm willing to do that, I... + 
I want to feel good about making love. + 
Oh, that is so... + 
sweet. + 
-Do you mind waiting? -Oh, no. + 
Not at all. + 
Mm. + 
Apparently, Samantha was wrong. + 
Some men could budge an inch. + 
In Mike's case, it may have been more like, + 
an inch and a half. + 
The next morning, Miranda was getting her usual wake-up call. + 
Mm... + 
Hey, where are you going? + 
I'm getting up. + 
Ah, come on, it's Saturday. Come on, lay down, slow down. + 
Come here. + 
How long are we gonna do this? + 
You want a time frame for cuddling? + 
Yeah. + 
Like 20 minutes? + 
Thirty? + 
You're kidding me. + 
It helps if I have an end point in mind. + 
I respond well to limits. + 
That's your problem, you got too many limits. + 
You gotta let go a little, Miranda. + 
Look... + 
Saturday is my free day, right? + 
I have spinning, and then I get my dry cleaning, + 
and then I get my nails done, + 
and I do my grocery shopping for the week. + 
-Okay? Okay. + 
You're not sounding very free to me. + 
Do you want to come with me + 
and get my dry cleaning? + 
No, I didn't think so. + 
An hour and a half, tops. + 
Twelve hours later, Steve went to work. + 
About the same time, we went out to our favorite bar + 
which on Saturdays, changes into drag queen bingo. + 
Come on, come on, N-23. + 
I really like him. + 
But this morning thing is killing me. + 
It's bad enough we've never done it at night, + 
but after we do it in the morning, + 
he just wants to lie there with me. + 
Everyone wants a guy who wants to cuddle. + 
O-33, ladies. + 
Shit! + 
Well, I'm jealous. + 
Big won't even spend the night at my place. + 
You know, what you have is real intimacy. + 
It's bed-arrest. + 
I've been horizontal all day, + 
and I had errands to do, I missed spinning. + 
You don't have to spin if you're having sex. + 
B-12! + 
How about N-23? + 
I don't know why I play this, I never win. + 
Why do I have to be the one to change my routine? + 
Well, maybe because you really like the guy + 
and it wouldn't kill you to slow down a little. + 
No, Miranda's right. + 
Why is it the woman that always has to change and never the guy? + 
Because we are more adaptable. + 
I love morning sex. + 
I haven't done morning sex since I was in college + 
and then it was only because I didn't have to be in class + 
until eleven. + 
Well, maybe you guys should come up + 
with a schedule or something. + 
A sex schedule? + 
Very romantic! + 
Yeah, surprise him at the bar + 
wearing nothing but a trench coat and a smile. + 
Now, that would be a happy hour. + 
O-69! + 
I just think that if you really believe in the relationship + 
then you should work at it. + 
This, from a woman who dumped a guy over foreskin. + 
Actually, we're still dating. + 
The Shar Pei? + 
He's getting circumcised. + 
Please tell me that we're not invited to the bris. + 
Could I get another board, please? + 
Samantha? + 
Yes. + 
It's me. + 
Brad. + 
Brad McColskey? + 
Brad was a semi-professional hockey player + 
Samantha had dated a few years back. + 
Apparently, the only thing he was checking these days were his pants... + 
at the door. + 
Look at you, miss thing, you look fabulous! + 
Oh, wow, well, so do you. + 
Uh... When did you start doing... Doing...? + 
Oh! About five years ago. + 
Right after you. + 
Maybe Samantha was wrong. + 
Apparently, she could change a man. + 
How are the kids? + 
Oh, good, good, Jake is in second grade. + 
Jake has two mommies. + 
There are other people who need boards, Samantha. + 
Take a chill pill, Miss Saigon! + 
Samantha? + 
Well, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. + 
Gotta go, enjoy the game! + 
N-23! + 
Bingo! + 
I am so much prettier than him. + 
Two hours later, I was supposed to meet Big at his place. + 
Two and a half hours later, + 
he showed up. + 
Hey! + 
Sorry. + 
You're a half hour late. + 
Your doorman thinks I'm a hooker. + 
-Did you make any money? -Not funny. I hate waiting, + 
here, for you. + 
There's a coffee shop, around the corner, + 
you could've waited, in. + 
You know what? I'm gonna go. + 
-Oh, don't be pissed. -I'm pissed! + 
Well... + 
Come upstairs. + 
You know, if you gave me a key, + 
I could wait upstairs next time. + 
A key? + 
Or you can stay at my place sometimes. + 
It's easy to pick my locks. + 
Yeah... + 
But then, I like my bed. + 
Look at that service. + 
Come on. + 
That night, something else changed. + 
Neither of us wanted to make love. + 
If this was all I was ever gonna get out of Big, was it enough for me? + 
And then, at 3:00 a.m., somewhere between sleep and waking, + 
I got my answer. + 
-Ow, dammit! -What? + 
Huh? Carrie? + 
Ah! Are you all right? + 
No! + 
What the fuck? + 
Oh, my God! + 
What the hell was that? + 
You knocked me out of bed! + 
You didn't even know I was here! + 
Well, I do now. Why don't you break my arm the next time? + 
I'm sorry. + 
Jesus! + 
God. All right, Sugar Ray. + 
-The bed's all yours. -Where are you going? + 
I'm gonna sleep on the couch. + 
Well, wait! Would you just let me explain? + 
Don't talk now... + 
Bad, to talk now. + 
But I couldn't sleep. + 
And at 4:00 a.m., I decided he couldn't sleep, either. + 
It's ice for your face. + 
Yes, I can feel that. + 
Okay, I know I've lost a little of my power here, + 
and I'm pretty sure that most women's magazines + 
would say that what I just did was a very bad idea. + 
But... + 
The thing is, the other night... + 
wasn't just about the cigar. + 
It never is. + 
I hate that you look at other women. + 
I hate that I don't have a key to your place. + 
You've never spent the night at my place. You can't even make... + 
space for me in your bed. + 
And it's not your fault because I never say it. + 
So, now I punched you, so, now I have to say it. + 
So, now I'm gonna say it. + 
I feel like, + 
I'm back in your life, + 
and nothing has really changed. + 
And I know that you can't change a man, + 
and you definitely can't change a man like you, but, + 
I still want... + 
something to change, a little bit, + 
for me. + 
Physical violence is never the answer. + 
Yeah. + 
I'm gonna go. + 
-Does it hurt? -Yes. + 
Look, + 
I'm sure there are things you don't like about me. + 
Not falling for that one. + 
Well, that was one thing I liked about Big. + 
He definitely knew when to shut up. + 
The next night, Charlotte took Mike out + 
for a postoperative scotch. + 
So, did it hurt? + 
On a scale of one to five, I'd give it a... + 
-Seventy-two? -Ah! + 
-You poor thing! -Oh, that's alright. + 
The worst is over, now I just... + 
accept sympathy and heal. + 
For how long? + 
About another week or so. + 
I can't wait. + 
Me either. + 
Oh, God, Charlotte, + 
you really turn me on. + 
-Ow, ow, ow, ow! -Oh! + 
You know, you really... You should go. + 
Much later that night, + 
bolstered by coffee, + 
Miranda decided to perform a 2:00 a.m. seduction. + 
Hello. + 
Wow, look at you, you look great! + 
What's the occasion? + 
It's 2:00 a.m. and I am still awake. + 
I thought we could celebrate. + 
I've had five cups of coffee. + 
That's worth a party. + 
Meet me in the bedroom, I'll get the wine. + 
Hey, get up. + 
What? + 
I think you should spend the night at your place tonight. + 
Why? + 
Because I'd really like to catch up on my sleep, + 
and I really don't want to worry about + 
having sex with you in the morning, + 
and then just lying there and being late. + 
You don't like having sex with me. + 
No, I do, I love it. + 
But just once I would like to do it at night, + 
like other normal Homo sapiens. + 
Hey, relax! We can have sex now. + 
We can't have sex now! + 
I had a window, and it happened half an hour ago! + 
You had a window for sex? + 
I'm sorry, I'm a lawyer, I get tired. + 
Yeah, well, I'm a bartender, + 
and I get awfully tired + 
of dealing with other people's neuroses. + 
When you get, uh... + 
Get, you know, a... + 
a picture window or a whole doorway of time, + 
call me. + 
Miranda had never felt less like a successful lawyer + 
in her life. + 
Even though she'd won her case, + 
she'd also been left with all the damages. + 
A week later, Charlotte finally got her chance + 
to break in the new merchandise. + 
What do you think? + 
It's perfect. + 
It was like her birthday and Christmas rolled into one. + 
You realize this makes me a virgin. + 
I'll be gentle. + 
That was really wonderful. + 
It was. + 
A five. + 
So, what do you want to do Saturday night? + 
Saturday? + 
Did we have plans? + 
No, but... + 
I thought maybe we could go to this drama league benefit, + 
or we could... you know, + 
go low-key and stay in and rent videos. + 
Oh, Charlotte, + 
hang on, listen. + 
I don't think I'm ready for this to be... + 
you know, like a big thing. + 
A big thing? + 
Well, I... I just feel like I can't be tied down right now. + 
There's a whole new me happening. + 
I feel like I should get out there and share it. + 
You want to share your penis? + 
Well... + 
Yeah. + 
I mean, I feel like I owe it to myself + 
to take the doggie out for a walk around the block. + 
You know? + 
Charlotte never saw Mike again. + 
She realized you could take the Shar Pei out of the penis, + 
but she could never take the dog out of the man. + 
A few days later, I realized you could change a man. + 
You could change him into not calling you. + 
Oh! + 
Hi. + 
Well, look at that. + 
No, you look at it, I've seen it already. + 
Sorry. + 
Ah, easy! + 
No hands near the face. + 
Come in. + 
I just came over to tell you something. + 
You're suing me, right? + 
Look, + 
maybe you need a key to know that I'm crazy about you. + 
But the thing is, I've given out like, + 
five keys. + 
And you never get 'em back. + 
And maybe I... + 
I hog my bed. But, I mean, it's my bed. + 
And, + 
well, I like you in it. + 
Wow, I should hit you more often. + 
-And the oranges. -What? + 
The oranges have to go. + 
Now, this is something I don't like about you. + 
I hate that you eat oranges in my bed. + 
You do? + 
They're sticky and they make the sheets stink. + 
That's it? + 
I like my sheets. + 
What are you gonna give me for the oranges? + 
A negotiation? + 
Yep. + 
Well, this could take a while. + 
It could. + 
Well, it looks like I may have to spend the night. + 
That night, for the first time, + 
Big spent the night at my place. + 
I realized that neither of us would ever fundamentally change, + 
but we were talking about it. + 
And maybe that was the biggest change of all. + 
The next day, my sheets stunk of cigars. + 
I changed them immediately. + 
Across town, it was 2:00 a.m., + 
and Miranda was no closer to getting sleep. + 
Hello? + 
Hi. + 
Sorry to wake you. + 
It's okay, I was awake. + 
Look, I don't wanna bug you. Um... + 
Do me a favor, + 
go to the window. + 
Okay. + 
Now look up. + 
Oh, my God! + 
It's amazing, isn't it? + 
It's a blue moon, + 
it's really rare. + 
I just wanted you to see it. + 
It was right then, + 
that Miranda finally slowed down, + 
and gave into Steve. + 
Come over when you're done, okay? + 
Yeah. + 
Night. + 
That night, Miranda and Steve made love. + 
And they did it again in the morning. + 
Miranda was an hour late for work and didn't even notice. + 
So, maybe you can't change a man, + 
but once in a blue moon, + 
you can change a woman. + 
欲望城市 + 
（性爱专家凯莉布雷萧） + 
“老狗新家伙” + 
有人说纽约的女人 是全世界最漂亮的 + 
这解释了为何纽约的男人 总是对她们目不转睛 + 
这个城市是为男人流转的目光 而设计的游乐场 + 
不幸的是，他们需要双眼 都看前方才能生存 + 
我是个快乐的纽约女人 我和大人物复合了 + 
不幸的是，我的纽约男人 仍盯着别的女人看 + 
如果那是他最大的毛病 你很幸运 + 
若这习惯如此微不足道 他应该改得掉 + 
这存在于他们的基因密码中 + 
-就像放屁 -你会害我吃不下我的脆饼 + 
接受大人物原本的模样 你不可能改变男人 + 
他绝不会让步 + 
但你能够巧妙地连哄带骗 + 
你可以在发型和穿着上做文章 不过连那也是长期抗争 + 
-我喜欢他的发型和穿着 -知足吧，没有完美的男人 + 
我并非要求完美 我只是希望他做一点小改变 + 
小心点 稍有不慎便会一败涂地 + 
当我们探讨改变理论时 米兰达正亲身体验 + 
她有了新公寓、新男友 + 
以及让她抓狂的新约会时间 + 
对不起 我本来以为酒吧会早点打烊 + 
-你已经睡了 -没有，我还醒着 + 
来吧 + 
过来，你没事吧？ + 
我看看 + 
-这样好一点了吗？ -好多了，谢谢 + 
你今晚过得如何？ + 
-我不知道，我睡着了 -抱歉我迟到了 + 
我以为我们大约两点会打烊 结果来了一群日本银行家 + 
他们喝得烂醉如泥 其中一个还吐了… + 
算了 + 
史蒂夫什么都好，除了一件事 + 
早安 + 
早 + 
过来 + 
他们的作息完全相反 + 
史蒂夫整个早上都很空闲 米兰达却得七点起床 + 
-可惜史蒂夫也在早上升国旗 -我得去上班 + 
还没 + 
米兰达早上只喜欢 + 
在去地铁站途中喝杯咖啡 + 
当晚，夏绿蒂跟迈克打得火热 + 
他是一个以五根搅拌棒评等制 闻名的美食评论家 + 
迈克？ + 
我们做爱吧 + 
夏绿蒂 你是个五根搅拌棒的女人 + 
正当夏绿蒂 准备探索他的命根子时 + 
却收到意外惊喜 + 
你的… + 
它… + 
没割包皮，这没关系吧？ + 
不…当然 + 
-当然没关系 -这大有关系 + 
她唯一看过一刀未剪的事物 + 
是原版的“乱世佳人” + 
有好多层皮，简直就像沙皮狗 + 
-你没看过未割包皮的阴茎？ -我来自康乃迪克州 + 
-你是跟人交往，不是命根子 -我很重视美感 + 
重要的是功能 + 
我不需要能自制包皮的男人 + 
我个人偏爱没割包皮的命根子 就像棒棒糖 + 
外面是硬的 里面却蕴藏美味的惊喜 + 
我不喜欢惊喜 我喜欢一览无遗 + 
我也是，很抱歉，那不正常 + 
事实上，85%的男人没割包皮 + 
-现在他们接管全世界了 -那是阴茎，不是酷斯拉 + 
如果85%的男人没割包皮 + 
我最多只和15%的男人上过床 + 
你几乎可算是处女 + 
他是个好人，怎么会这样？ + 
-也许他父母不信这一套 -我一定会帮我儿子割包皮 + 
现在可以付钱请别人帮你做 + 
我才不想让别的女人 在背后叫我儿子沙皮狗 + 
我认为没割包皮的男人最棒 他们会更努力 + 
我再清楚不过了 我跟其中五个人上过床 + 
-总数是多少？ -无限多 + 
当晚，大人物和我 心血来潮外出用餐 + 
-再来一点格拉帕酒？ -不，谢了 + 
今天我的编辑打电话给我… + 
-你刚跟我说话？ -没错 + 
抱歉，这里不能抽烟 + 
真的吗？你百分之百肯定？ + 
因为我查过这张桌子的位置 + 
我确信它是在雪茄友善区内 + 
我并不介意 但这是为了其他顾客 + 
如果那五位顾客不介意 就没问题了？ + 
-先生，我必须… -等一下 + 
不好意思 今天是我在世的最后一日 + 
明天早上我就要被处死了 + 
那位是我的假释官 你们介意我抽雪茄吗？ + 
抱歉，我可以抽雪茄吗？ + 
让我先说一句 + 
我乐意请各位再喝一杯酒 + 
显然其他顾客 一点也不觉得困扰 + 
我没有勇气告诉大人物 其实他的行为让我很反感 + 
没有人会当着你的面说 他们讨厌你抽雪茄 + 
-那才好 -你真的很傲慢 + 
我以为你正喜欢我这一点 + 
或许大人物说得对 + 
或许我们在这段感情中正处于 + 
对方吸引你的地方 + 
全变成了难以忍受的缺点 + 
就在此时，他的毛病又犯了 + 
-怎么了？ -我… + 
我…讨厌那雪茄 + 
而你当着我的面说了 + 
纽约无时无刻不在改变 + 
一眨眼，纽约人便改变了发型 政治立场和朋友 + 
若改变如此容易 为何对大人物而言这么难？ + 
难道我要用头撞墙 + 
好让他注意我？ + 
我必须改变我的期望吗？ 或者是否可能… + 
你可以改变一个男人吗？ + 
我丈夫以前很迷运动节目 + 
后来我开始 跟他最好的朋友乱搞 + 
现在他一心只想守着我 + 
每个女友都希望我有所改变 工作、朋友、态度等等 + 
结果我唯一的改变就是换女友 + 
不可能 + 
夏绿蒂即将发现 有些男人的确可以改变 + 
谢谢你的晚餐，棒极了 + 
那么…我能跟你一起上楼吗？ + 
明天我得早起 而且我家乱七八糟 + 
-没关系，我明白 -真的？ + 
那天晚上发生的事… + 
你不是第一个 有那种反应的女人 + 
-真的吗？ -我决定一劳永逸 + 
我已经为此困扰太久了 所以… + 
我打算去割包皮 + 
-你肯这么做？ -是的 + 
手术很痛，而且伤口要很久 才会愈合，但我愿意这么做 + 
我希望能好好享受做爱的乐趣 + 
那真是太体贴了 + 
-你介意等待吗？ -一点也不 + 
显然莎曼珊错了 有些男人会让步 + 
以迈克为例 他的牺牲还真不少 + 
隔天早上 米兰达又被起床号吵醒了 + 
-你上哪儿去？ -我要起床 + 
今天是星期六，躺着吧，过来 + 
我们要躺多久？ + 
-拥抱也有时间限制？ -是的，好比二十分钟？ + 
-还是三十分钟？ -你在开玩笑吧 + 
让我知道何时结束比较好 我习惯有限制 + 
这就是你的问题 你给自己太多限制了 + 
听着，星期六是我的空闲日 我得洗衣服，再去拿干洗衣物 + 
修指甲 还得去采购一周的食物 + 
听起来不怎么空闲 + 
你要陪我去拿干洗的衣服吗？ + 
我想也是 + 
最多再躺一个半小时 + 
十二个小时后 史蒂夫去上班了 + 
我们齐聚在最爱的酒吧 + 
这里星期六会举行 变装皇后的宾果游戏 + 
快点…N23 + 
我真的很喜欢他 但早上做爱这档事把我整惨了 + 
不在晚上做已经够糟了 + 
完事后他还要我陪他一起躺着 + 
每个人都想要可以拥抱的男人 + 
-各位，O33 -该死 + 
我很嫉妒你 大人物甚至不肯在我家过夜 + 
-你拥有真实的亲密关系 -我是被软禁在床上 + 
我曾整天躺在床上 但我有事要做，我没洗衣服 + 
能做爱就别洗衣服了 + 
-B12 -来个N23如何？ + 
-我干嘛玩这个？我从没赢过 -为什么我得调整作息？ + 
因为你真的很喜欢他 而且放慢生活步调也无妨 + 
为什么改变的总是女人 永远不是男人？ + 
-因为我们适应力比较强 -我喜欢在早上做爱 + 
我大学毕业以后 就没在早上做过爱了 + 
而且那还是因为11点才有课 + 
-你应该排一个时间表 -做爱时间表？那还真浪漫呢 + 
给他一个惊喜 只穿着雨衣，带着微笑去找他 + 
那将是酒吧的快乐时光 + 
如果你对这段感情认真 你应该想办法维持下去 + 
为了包皮把男友甩了的女人 居然说这种话 + 
-事实上，我们还在交往 -那个沙皮狗？ + 
他要去割包皮 + 
拜托告诉我，我们不必去观礼 + 
再给我一块板子好吗？ + 
-莎曼珊？ -我就是 + 
是我，布莱德 + 
布莱德麦考斯基？ + 
布莱德是莎曼珊几年前 交往过的曲棍球员 + 
最近他唯一阻挡的东西 在他的裤裆 + 
看看你，大美女，你好漂亮 + 
你也是，你从什么时候开始… + 
大约五年前，跟你分手之后 + 
也许莎曼珊错了 显然她可以改变一个男人 + 
-孩子们好吗 -很好，杰克上二年级了 + 
杰克有两个妈妈了 + 
别的客人也需要板子，莎曼珊 + 
-吃颗感冒药吧，西贡小姐 -莎曼珊？ + 
模仿是最真诚的奉承 我要走了，玩得愉快 + 
N23 + 
-宾果 -我比他漂亮多了 + 
两个小时后 我和大人物约在他家见面 + 
两个半小时后，他终于现身了 + 
-对不起 -你迟到了半小时 + 
门房以为我是妓女 + 
-有生意上门吗？ -不好笑，我讨厌等人 + 
在这里，等你 + 
转角有一家咖啡厅 + 
-你可以进去等 -我要走了 + 
-别生气 -我快气死了 + 
上楼吧 + 
如果你给我一把钥匙 下次我就能在楼上等 + 
钥匙？ + 
或者偶尔你可以在我家过夜 我的锁很容易撬开 + 
可是我喜欢我的床 + 
还有电梯服务 + 
来吧 + 
当晚，气氛不太一样 我们两个都不想做爱 + 
如果大人物只能付出这么多 这对我来说够吗？ + 
然后，凌晨三点 + 
在半梦半醒之际 我得到了答案 + 
-该死 -怎么了？ + 
-凯莉，你没事吧？ -才怪 + 
-搞什么鬼？ -我的天 + 
你干嘛？ + 
你把我推下床 你根本不知道我在这里 + 
我现在知道了 下次何不打断我的手臂？ + 
-对不起 -老天 + 
好吧，整张床都让给你 + 
-你要去哪里？ -我去睡沙发 + 
-听我解释 -现在不要谈 + 
现在谈话的时机很坏 + 
但我睡不着 + 
凌晨四点，我知道他也睡不着 + 
这是给你敷脸的冰块 + 
我感觉得到 + 
我知道是我乱发脾气 + 
我也肯定大部分的女性杂志 + 
会说我不该那么做 + 
但那晚我生气不只是因为雪茄 + 
从来都不是 + 
我讨厌你看别的女人 + 
我讨厌没有你家的钥匙 你从不在我家过夜 + 
你的床甚至容不下我 + 
这不是你的错 因为是我没跟你说 + 
而现在我揍了你一拳 所以我非说不可 + 
所以现在我要说了 + 
我觉得虽然我们复合了… + 
但却没什么改变 我知道你不可能改变一个男人 + 
像你这样的男人更不可能改变 可是… + 
我仍然希望有一点改变 + 
为了我 + 
肢体暴力绝非解决之道 + 
我走了 + 
-会痛吗？ -会 + 
听着，我相信我一定有 让你不满意的地方 + 
少来这套 + 
这是我喜欢大人物的一点 他很清楚何时该闭嘴 + 
隔天晚上，夏绿蒂和迈克 出去喝一杯手术后的威士忌 + 
那会痛吗？ + 
以一到五的等级来说 我想是… + 
-好可怜 + 
没关系，最坏的已经过去了 现在我只接受同情，等待复原 + 
-需要多久？ -再过一个礼拜左右 + 
-我等不及了 -我也是 + 
天啊，夏绿蒂 你真是让我性致勃勃 + 
你走吧 + 
当晚，藉着咖啡提神 + 
米兰达决定施展午夜诱惑 + 
你看你，美极了 有什么大事？ + 
现在两点了但我还不想睡 我想我们应该庆祝一下 + 
-我已经喝了五杯咖啡 -那倒值得开个派对 + 
在房间等我，我去拿酒 + 
-起来 -怎么了？ + 
今晚你该回家睡觉 + 
为什么？ + 
我想多睡一下，而且不必担心 + 
早上还得跟你做爱 之后躺着休息，导致上班迟到 + 
-你不喜欢跟我做爱？ -我很喜欢 + 
但我希望至少有一次在晚上做 像其他正常人一样 + 
-放轻松，我们可以现在做 -不行 + 
本来有个很好的时机 但那是半小时前的事了 + 
-做爱还有时机？ -抱歉，我是个律师，我会累 + 
我是个酒保，早已厌烦别人 情绪失控、大呼小叫 + 
当你… + 
时机对了或是门户大开… + 
再打电话给我 + 
米兰达从未觉得自己 是个如此失败的律师 + 
即使她打赢了官司 却也受到伤害 + 
一个星期后 夏绿蒂终于有机会 + 
一窥新货的真面目 + 
-你认为怎么样？ -太完美了 + 
这感觉好像是 同时收到生日和圣诞礼物 + 
你知道这将是我的初体验？ + 
我会很温柔的 + 
-那真是太美妙了 -没错，是五根搅拌棒 + 
你礼拜六晚上要做什么？ + 
礼拜六？我们有计划了吗？ + 
没有，但我想我们可以去参加 戏剧联展的义演 + 
或是低调一点 待在家里看录影带 + 
夏绿蒂，等等，听我说 + 
我认为我还没准备好定下来 + 
定下来？ + 
我只是觉得我现在不能被绑住 + 
我已经焕然一新 我应该出去外面和大家分享 + 
你想分享你的命根子？ + 
我…没错 + 
我应该带它出去见识一下 + 
夏绿蒂再也没见过迈克 + 
她明白你可以让命根子 脱离沙皮狗的模样 + 
却永远无法去除男人的狗性 + 
几天后 我发现你的确可以改变男人 + 
你可以让他不再打电话给你 + 
-瞧瞧那黑眼圈 -你才看清楚，我已经看过了 + 
对不起 + 
别轻举妄动，手不能靠近脸部 + 
进来吧 + 
我只是来跟你说一件事 + 
你要告我对不对？ + 
听着… + 
也许你需要一把钥匙 才能相信我为你疯狂 + 
但事实上我曾给过五把钥匙 + 
却从没拿回来过 + 
也许我霸占了整张床 但那是我的床，而且… + 
我喜欢你躺在上面 + 
-我应该更常打你 -还有柳橙 + 
床上不能吃柳橙 这是我不喜欢你的地方 + 
我讨厌你在我床上吃柳橙 + 
真的？ + 
它们粘粘的 还会把我的床单弄臭 + 
-就这样？ -我喜欢我的床单 + 
你拿什么跟我交换柳橙？ + 
-你要讨价还价？ -是的 + 
-这可能要一段时间 -有可能 + 
看来我得在这里过夜了 + 
当晚，大人物第一次 在我家过夜 + 
我明白我们两个 都无法彻底改变 + 
但我们愿意面对这件事 + 
也许那就是最大的改变 + 
隔天，我的床单都是雪茄味 + 
我马上把它们换掉 + 
凌晨两点，在城的另一头 + 
米兰达却毫无睡意 + 
-喂？ -嗨 + 
嗨 + 
-抱歉吵醒你了 -不要紧，我还没睡 + 
我不想烦你 + 
帮我一个忙，到窗边来 + 
抬头望 + 
-我的天 -很美吧？ + 
蓝色的月亮，很少见的 + 
我只是想让你看看 + 
就在此刻，米兰达终于 放慢步调，向史蒂夫投降 + 
下班后过来，好吗？ + 
好 + 
再见 + 
当晚，米兰达和史蒂夫做爱 + 
他们在早上又做了一次 + 
米兰达迟到了一小时 她却完全没注意 + 
也许你无法改变男人 + 
但在千载难逢的机会下 你可以改变一个女人 +
