Two years ago, my friend, Susan Sharon, +
the east coast rep for a line of Italian cashmere sportswear, +
married a very mean man. +
What did I tell you about listening to my CD's? +
You put Natalie Imbruglia back in U2! +
Now, I only see her once or twice a year, +
generally when her husband is out of town. +
And now I cannot remember if I've taken my Halcion +
before dinner or not. +
So I take another one, I have a cocktail, +
I'm feeling no pain. +
The next thing I know this freaked out stewardess +
is slapping me awake. +
"Signora, Signora! Buona sera! Buona sera!" +
So I open my eyes, I look around the plane, +
it's completely empty. +
Turns out we landed in Milan 30 minutes ago. +
Oh, my God. +
Oh, you know what, come up to my apartment +
because I have something for you. +
Oh, wow. +
-The place looks fantastic. -Shh. +
-Richard's asleep. -Oh! +
-Be right back. -In the... okay. +
Susan Sharon and her husband had one of those very adult +
apartments that made me feel like I was about sixteen +
visiting the home of a friend whose parents +
thought I was a bad influence. +
â™ª Happy birthday, Carrie â™ª +
-â™ª Happy birthday, Carrie â™ª -You didn't have to. +
-I know it's a little early. -Look at you, jeez. +
Oh, Susan Sharon, it's beautiful. +
It's 100% Italian cashmere and light as a feather. +
God, I love it. +
-It's a cashmere-ical. +
You wouldn't believe what Barneys gets for this. +
- Oh, don't tell me. -Nine hundred dollars. +
Nine hundred dollars for a scarf? No. +
Oh, no. +
Listen, do you mind if I return it? I could really use the cash. +
No, why not? +
Why do you think they call it cash-mere? +
What the hell is going on? +
Oh, sorry, honey. +
But Carrie had this idea about returning-- +
What... +
Was our agreement about visitors after 9 p.m.? +
I know, it's just that it's her birthday. +
I'm on London time! +
I got to be up in three hours when the markets open. +
So I'd really appreciate it if you'd take the fucking +
noise somewhere else. +
Okay, sweetie, I'm gonna give you a call, okay? +
Okay, you know what, just ignore him, +
-you don't have to leave. -No, shh. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. +
I'll talk to you later. +
Goodnight, grumpy. +
Get the fuck out of my house! +
Taunting the psychotic spouse I realized... -Shut up! +
...was not a wise move. +
-I will not shut up! -Just shut the fuck up! +
I wondered, could Susan Sharon's marriage be that bad +
or was their fighting just a form of foreplay? +
In which case, I was merely the catalyst to get things going. +
Hello. +
I am so sorry. +
I'm so embarrassed. +
No, don't be. He's just-- +
He's just tired and cranky. +
That was classic Richard. +
Tyrannical, emotionally abusive. +
I don't know what to do anymore. +
Well, maybe there were special circumstances tonight that-- +
He works hard. +
He's sleep deprived. +
Blah, blah, blah. +
I don't give a shit! +
What would you do if you were with a guy like that? +
Would you leave? +
Well, I, you know, if things didn't change. +
Well, they haven't. +
And they won't. +
So... +
You think I should leave him? +
If you're not happy. +
You know, life's too short. +
-I gotta go. As I hung up, I realized +
I had just been placed in a classic +
no-win situation. +
Telling a friend to leave her husband +
is something you just don't do. +
If she does break up with him, it's your fault. +
If she doesn't break up with him, +
she knows that you think that she should. +
And therefore can never speak to you again. +
Either way, you're screwed. +
Which is a shame, because there goes your cashmere connection. +
She had me at a weak moment. I was tired. +
I'd just been chased out of her apartment. +
I have a birthday looming. +
-I said too much. -No, I just think in an intimate relationship +
you should be able to say anything. +
I would highly disagree. +
Practically all the relationships I know +
are based on a foundation of lies +
and mutually accepted delusion. +
James and me, for instance. +
I pretend that he doesn't have a small dick. +
And he pretends not to notice we haven't had sex for three weeks. +
You should be working for the U.N. +
I happen to be in an intimate relationship at the moment. +
And I can tell you that the level of verbal discourse +
has become a little too intimate. +
Are we speaking of spring roll guy? +
-Mm-hmm. -Spring roll guy, who's that? +
Aaron Melman. He's a dermatologist I met at the Vietnamese +
lunch truck outside my building. +
So, what's the problem? +
The problem, if you can call it that, +
is spring roll guy liked to talk dirty in bed. +
Oh, baby, I just love the way your pussy feels. +
So wet. +
And warm. +
And tight. +
Kissing your beautiful tits feels unbelievably sexy. +
So hot and nasty. +
How's it feel to you? +
Umm. +
What you said. +
Oh, that can be a turn on! +
Sure. But now he wants me to reciprocate. +
And I can't. +
I never could. +
Why not? +
Because sex is not a time to chat. +
In fact, it's one of the few instances +
in my overly articulated, exceedingly verbal life, +
where it is perfectly appropriate, +
if not preferable to shut up. +
And now suddenly I have to worry about being stumped for conversation? +
-No, thank you. -Just keep talking about his big cock. +
Correction, his big beautiful cock. +
We're using the "c" word now? +
Sorry. I can't use adjectives. +
A simple "you're so hard" is often quite effective. +
Sometimes men just need to hear a little encouragement. +
Such as? +
You know, "Yeah, stud, that's right. +
Uh-huh. +
Don't stop, just like that. +
C'mon, fucker, don't stop." +
You're kidding, right? +
Wow! +
No, they like it. +
So are you-- Are you really telling us +
that during sex you're just, you're completely mute? +
No, I can do a good orgasm alert. +
You know, "I'm gonna cum, I'm gonna cum, I'm gonna cum." +
But that's because, you know, I'm gonna cum. +
Anything else feels like make believe. +
Well, if you really like this guy, +
then you're gonna have to start talking. +
Was Miranda right? +
Have we put such a premium +
on being open and honest with one another +
that we've misplaced the boundaries of propriety? +
Are there still certain things in a relationship +
one should never say? +
My best friend just got engaged +
to the biggest loser I've ever met. +
What am I supposed to tell her? +
"You're marrying an imbecile?" +
My wife, she's had her breasts done twice. +
They look fantastic, they feel like shit. +
I keep that thought to myself. +
I'm a single, 38-year-old woman still hoping to get married. +
I don't want to know the truth. +
I told Richard I couldn't spend another day married to a man +
who behaves like an utter asshole. +
There it was standing across from me. +
Biscotti-eating, cashmered-swattled proof +
that I had said too much. +
-Then what happened? -Well, once I said that, the flood gates just opened. +
He said to me that there was this moment during our wedding +
when he looked at me and he felt this huge wave of disappointment +
because I looked so generic. Hmm! +
And I said to him, you know what? On second thought, +
no, I don't think the Rogaine is working. +
So then he said to me that if I leave +
all he'll feel for me is pity. +
Because he'll be remarried within a year +
and I'll be single for the rest of my life. +
I didn't want to tell Susan Sharon +
that his last statement was probably true. +
I just feel like I owe you so much. +
I mean, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have had the guts to do this. +
-Oh, I didn't really tell you-- -It's like I was under house arrest for the past few years +
and now I'm suddenly free. +
So what are you gonna do? +
Do you mind if I stay at your place tonight? +
Oh, of course not. +
That evening as Susan Sharon squatted on my couch... +
Oh, God. +
...Charlotte came home to the new male in her life. +
Fed up with lonely mornings, cuddle-free nights +
and the lack of unconditional love she so longed for, +
Charlotte decided to take matters into her own hands. +
She combed the city for the perfect specimen of breeding, style and trendiness. +
Henry, I'm home. +
-Hi, my good boy. +
Hello, Henry. +
My good boy. +
Until she found the perfect man, +
Charlotte would have the perfect dog. +
That night, Samantha, who was never any good at keeping a secret, +
suddenly found the one thing she couldn't say +
was the only thing she could think about. +
Sweetheart, is anything wrong? +
Because if there is, I want you to tell me. +
Oh, no, honey, I'm tired. +
Well, I just feel like you've become so distant. +
Like you're upset with me about something. +
I'm sorry, it's not you, it's me. +
I'm not upset about anything. +
You're wonderful. +
Will you do me a favor and come see a couple's counselor with me? +
Samantha dreaded the shrink +
the way most people feared the dentist. +
Well, if it's really important to you. I... +
Great. +
Goodnight. +
She suddenly longed for the simple days +
of emotional unavailability and hot one night stands. +
Meanwhile, across town, +
Miranda was appearing as Eliza Doolittle, +
in My "Filthy" Lady. +
I just love kissing this sensitive spot right here. +
You like that? +
Uh-huh. +
Tell me what you like. +
That. +
You like my hand there? Caressing your breast? +
-Sure. -Gently pinching your nipple. +
Fine. +
Oh, yeah. Kissing my chest. +
That's hot. +
That really turns me on. +
How's it feel? +
-Hot? -Hot. +
And? +
-Hairy? -Oh, God, you're getting me hard. +
Tell me how it feels. +
Big. +
And? +
Hard? +
-Rock hard. -Yeah, keep talking. +
A big rock. +
Yes. +
A hard rock. +
A big hard rock. +
Oh, yeah. +
-A sausage. -Oh, baby, you are so nasty. +
Surprisingly enough, once Miranda opened her mouth, +
she found it difficult to shut up. +
A big, throbbing, +
-rock-hard sausage. +
That night I took Susan Sharon to meet the new male in Charlotte's life. +
True to form, he was already falling far short of her high expectations. +
Well, he did it a minute ago. +
He was inconsistent... +
Get the ball, Henry. +
Selfishly stubborn, +
and hopelessly co-dependent. +
Isn't he smart? +
We shouldn't stay long. +
I want to be back at your apartment in case Richard calls. +
What do you mean, I thought you were leaving him? +
I am, but if he calls I want to be there to tell him +
that I don't want to talk to him. +
Well, that's really passive aggressive. +
You should only speak to him if you have something +
specific to say. +
Do you believe I married such a prick? +
Well, you didn't know he was a prick. +
I just can't believe that prick hasn't called. +
Although he does have this sweet side, you know, +
you just don't know him very well. +
Do you think I did the right thing, Henry? +
-Or should I give him another chance-- +
He's a dog, not an oracle. +
The next morning +
I woke up to an unsettling birthday surprise. +
Coming. +
-Oh. -Sign here. +
Thank you. +
Oh, my God. +
"Best wishes on your birthday." +
It's from Big. +
What kind of flowers? +
Roses, red. +
Big. +
Expensive. +
What do you think it means? +
It means rip up the card. +
And watch out for the thorns. +
No, no, no, this is the grand gesture. +
The grand gesture? +
Yeah, you know, if you break up with someone and they just +
disappear from your life altogether, +
well, then it wasn't meant to be. +
But if they make a powerful declaration of their love, +
then you really have to reconsider. +
You think a dozen roses and a card that says, +
"best wishes" qualifies as the grand gesture? +
Well, you know men, they can never say "I was wrong." +
They just send flowers. +
Yeah, well, sometimes a rose is just a rose. +
Now, jewelry, that's another story. +
Henry, no. +
Henry, no, not the purse. +
You know, I really don't need this on my birthday. +
I mean, really, what does this mean, +
the ball's in my court or something? +
I don't want to play games. +
This is not the grand gesture. +
This is the vague gesture. +
Which is truly worse than no gesture at all. +
You know, under the guise of being thoughtful +
he's actually being very selfish. +
I agree. He's muddied the waters. +
Oh, you're all just cuckoo. +
The man sends her flowers on her birthday +
and you're all condemning him. Henry, no. +
No, damnit. +
For chrissake, give that dog a break. +
He's already eaten four pairs of shoes. +
I just don't want him starting on the purses. +
Damnit, now. Okay, we're gonna go home. +
You said you wanted to get out and socialize, +
but you just have to learn how to behave. +
Bye. +
-Listen, you're just going to have to learn how to behave. +
I told you. I told you. +
Speaking of cuckoo. +
Charlotte was at the point in her relationship +
where she was starting to see the real Henry. +
But she did raise a valid question. +
Was "I was wrong" the one thing Mr. Big couldn't say? +
I realized that just because we were no longer together +
didn't mean I couldn't be polite. +
-Yeah. -Hey, it's me. +
Carrie. +
Hey, how are you doing? +
Great, great. +
Listen, I just wanted to call and thank you for the flowers. +
That was very thoughtful of you. +
Oh, yeah, yeah. +
Well, you know, my secretary had it on her calendar. +
So, I, you know. +
Oh, so your secretary sent them. +
No, I sent the flowers, my secretary alerted me +
to the day. +
Oh, well, that was very thoughtful of her +
and you for sending them. +
So, you're welcome, um, What are you doing on the big day? +
Oh, well, uh... +
Stanford's arranged this party down at Layla. +
You know, it's that Moroccan restaurant. +
You should come. +
The instant the words popped out of my mouth, I regretted them. +
Uh, well, I... I made some plans already, but... +
Or not. I mean just forget it. +
I could maybe stop by later. +
Oh, fine. I mean, whatever. +
Uh... I may bring someone. +
Well, yeah, uh... +
Come and bring that person. +
And maybe I'll see you later. +
And thank you again for the thoughtful flowers. +
I couldn't believe it. +
I had just invited my ex and his date to my birthday party. +
As if getting older wasn't traumatic enough. +
That afternoon in the office of Velma Rudin, +
celebrated psychologist and author of In-To-Me-See , +
A Couple's Guide To Intimacy , +
Samantha did her best not to say +
the one thing she knew she should not say. +
I can't help but notice that our sex life has diminished. +
That's normal, isn't it? I mean, after a while... +
How long has it been? +
-Um... -A month. +
Don't take it all so seriously. +
Have fun with your sexuality. +
Have you tried playing erotic games? +
Samantha had a burning desire to confess that James had been +
playing "Hide The Salami" since the day they met. +
I'm just not feeling very sexual these days. +
I saw you masturbating the other day +
when I came out of the shower. +
Many women are simply unable to achieve orgasm through intercourse. +
It's nothing to be ashamed of. +
I think you have a big problem with intimacy. +
-No, that's not it. -Then what is it? +
It's... it's nothing. Nothing. Forget about it. +
Sweetheart, there's nothing you can say +
-that can hurt me as long as it's what you're feeling. -It's nothing! +
That seems to be all the time we have for today. +
Nice work, you two. +
Shall we say next week, same time? +
Good for me. +
Samantha? +
The idea of seeing Velma "in-to-me-see" Rudin on a weekly basis +
was much more than Samantha could bear. +
Your penis is too small. +
Excuse me? +
It doesn't-- and it just-- +
It can't. And I can't. +
And it's... it's just too damn small. +
Did you ever stop to think that maybe your vagina is too big? +
What can I say... I need a big dick. +
I hear that. +
As Samantha paid the price of mentioning the unmentionable, +
Miranda discovered that free speech +
comes with a cost of its own. +
I just love putting my hand around your cock. +
I just love hearing you say "cock." +
Your big hard cock. +
Cock, cock, cock, cock. +
Why couldn't I ever say that before? +
It's just a word. +
And why does it turn us both on when I say it? +
What else do you like? +
I like it when you're rough. +
When you throw my legs over your head, I lose all control. +
Mm-hmm. And what do I like? +
You like it when I'm biting your nipple. +
Mm-hmm. And what else? +
You like it when I'm kissing your balls. +
Oh, yeah, keep going. +
And you really like it when I slip my finger in your ass. +
Excuse me? +
You just love a finger in your ass. +
How was I supposed to know that "you love a finger in your ass" +
is the one thing you can't say to a man in bed? +
Trust me, that's not the only thing. +
But it's true, he enjoys it. +
-So do a lot of men. -But no, they enjoy it, they just don't want it +
brought to their attention. +
Personally, I don't like anything in my ass. +
And I know that may come as a surprise. +
I just feel so betrayed, you know. +
He tried to get me to start talking dirty, +
then I got into it a little bit. +
And then he pulled the rug out from under me. +
Men are so frustratingly inconsistent. +
That's why I love my Henry. +
He's just a big love bug. +
You tell him anything and he just licks your face. +
Charlotte, you may be on to something. +
Waiter, another double vodka rocks +
for the birthday girl, please. +
The truth was vodka was my only ally. +
At any moment, Big was just gonna walk right in here with his gorgeous date, +
smile at me like some distant stranger and say something +
absolutely crushing like-- +
Happy birthday, baby. +
Hi. +
Hey, glad you could make it. +
Can't stay long. +
Left my camel outside. +
Oh. Carrie, you remember Jack, right? +
Jack? +
You mean, Jack is your date? +
Well, I wasn't aware that we were formally dating. +
-But now that you-- -It is so good to see you again. +
How have you been? +
Marvelous, just split up with a bitch who broke my heart. +
At least she didn't get my money. +
Well, happy birthday to me. +
An hour later, my Arabian Nights fantasy birthday +
suddenly felt like Midnight Express. +
How are you? +
Great. How are you? +
Good. Fine. +
Good. +
Excuse me. What is your ex doing at your birthday? +
I told him to drop by for a drink. +
Jeez, I didn't think he'd stay for a lap dance. +
Oh, my God, have you tried the baba ghanoush? +
It is to die for. +
I don't eat baba ghanoush. +
Ah, you don't know what you're missing. +
I can't believe the bastard had the nerve to show up. +
I can't believe what that woman can do with her bellybutton. +
Please, I think I'm about to lose my couscous. +
While I watched my ex get a Mesopotamian lap dance, +
Susan Sharon made a play for Mr. Marvelous. +
I don't know if I can deal with being single all over again. +
I mean, it's not like every relationship doesn't have its ups and downs, you know? +
It's just that my husband and I, we work very hard. +
And we probably don't spend enough down time together. +
You know, compounded by the fact that neither of us gets enough sleep. +
You know, but then again, who does? +
It's just that I really never imagined myself +
as a divorcÃ©e, you know? +
But I do think it's more important to till your own soil +
than it is to go in search of greener pastures. +
Do you ever shut the fuck up? +
In that moment, Susan Sharon suddenly realized how much +
she desperately missed her husband. +
Henry. +
That night Charlotte came home to a very unpleasant surprise. +
Oh-oh. +
Henry! +
Bad! +
Charlotte realized, like so many males before him, +
Henry had shit all over her perfect world. +
He and Charlotte soon parted ways. +
And the one thing she could never say was... +
"I got rid of the puppy." +
Of course we all know what happened to him. +
He'd become the glue that put Susan Sharon and her husband +
back together again. +
Shut up. +
-Shut the fuck up. +
Although neither of them could ever admit +
that a dog saved their marriage. +
And later that evening, as my birthday passed +
into the early morning hours of just another day, +
I found myself alone on the street with Mr. Big. +
So another year older. +
-And none the wiser. -Hey, that's the way it goes. +
Can I give you a ride home? +
No, I'm just gonna grab a cab. +
You need cab fare? +
No, I'm okay. +
Good 'cause I think I left all my 20's +
in that belly dancer's crotch. +
Well... +
Well. +
Goodnight. +
As I watched him go, +
I realized the one thing I couldn't say to Mr. Big was... +
I'm still not over you. +

，残酷的真相 +
两年前，我朋友苏珊雪伦 +
意大利喀什米尔羊毛运动服 东岸代理商 +
嫁给一个脾气非常暴躁的男人 +
我跟你说过听完CD要怎样？ +
你把娜塔莉放到U2的盒子里了 +
现在我跟她每年只见一两次面 通常是当她丈夫出城的时候 +
我不记得晚餐前 是否吃过安眠药 +
所以我又吃了一颗 喝了杯鸡尾酒，不觉得痛苦 +
接下来我只知道 空姐正赏我巴掌，想把我打醒 +
“夫人…到了…” +
我睁开眼睛环顾机舱 人都走光了 +
-飞机半小时前在米兰降落了 -我的天 +
我要送你一个礼物 +
-这里看起来好气派 -小声一点，理查睡着了 +
在…？好的 +
苏珊雪伦和她丈夫的公寓 装潢得好讲究 +
我觉得自己像个16岁少女 +
去朋友家玩，她父母却认为 我会带坏他们的孩子 +
生日快乐，凯莉… +
-我知道还没到 -天啊 +
-苏珊雪伦，好漂亮 -这是百分之百喀什米尔羊毛 +
-轻得像羽毛一样 -我好喜欢，这是金钱的奇迹 +
你知道巴尼百货卖多少钱？ 九百块 +
九百块一条围巾？不会吧… +
我可以拿去退吗？ 换现金比较实在 +
有何不可？你以为它为什么 又称做“全是钱”？ +
-到底在搞什么鬼？ -抱歉，亲爱的，凯莉想到… +
我们对于九点以后接待访客 定了什么协议？ +
-我知道，但她生日快到了… -我的作息是以伦敦时间为准 +
再过三小时开市，我就得起床 +
拜托你们去别的地方狂欢 我会感激不尽 +
-我再打电话给你 -别理他… +
没关系… +
-晚安 -滚出去 +
跟神经质的另一半争执 是不明智的 +
你给我闭嘴 +
她的婚姻真有那么糟 还是吵架只是前戏的形式？ +
无论如何 我的角色只不过是催化剂 +
-喂？ -对不起，我觉得好丢脸 +
没有必要，他只是疲倦而暴躁 +
那就是典型的理查 专制跋扈以及情绪化的辱骂 +
-我不知道该拿他怎么办 -也许今晚的事… +
他工作卖力、睡眠不足… 我才不在乎 +
-若是你会怎么做？离开吗？ -如果情况没有改善的话 +
情况的确没改善，也不会改善 +
-你认为我该离开他吗？ -如果你不快乐，人生很短暂 +
-我得挂线了 -挂掉电话之际我意识到 +
自己刚陷入一个 吃力不讨好的处境 +
你绝不能劝朋友离开她的丈夫 +
如果她真的跟他分手 那便是你的错 +
如果没分手，而她知道 你的想法，可能会跟你绝交 +
-不管怎样，倒霉的都是你 -可惜，喀什米尔的通路断了 +
她在我脆弱的时刻找上我 我累了 +
我生日快到了，我太多话了 +
不，在一段亲密关系中 你应该要能畅所欲言 +
我不同意 +
我知道的恋情几乎都建筑在 谎言的基础上 +
而且彼此都接受欺瞒 好比说我和詹姆斯 +
我假装他的命根子并不小 +
而他假装没注意到 我们已经三个礼拜没做爱了 +
-你应该替联合国工作 -我现在有交往对象 +
口头对话的程度 已经变得有点过于亲密 +
-你是指春卷先生？ -他是谁？ +
艾宁莫门，我吃越南菜时 认识的皮肤科医生 +
-问题出在哪里？ -问题出在… +
春卷先生喜欢在床第间 口出淫语 +
宝贝，我就爱你阴道的触感 +
那么湿润、温暖而紧实 +
亲吻你美丽的乳房 觉得难以置信的性感 +
-火辣又淫秽，感觉如何？ -你说得对 +
-那会让人欲火焚身 -当然 +
但现在他希望我回报 我做不到，我从不来这一套 +
-为什么？ -因为做爱时不适合聊天 +
这是我终日滔滔不绝 发挥伶俐口才的生活中 +
少数可以不必说话的时机 +
现在我却得为此大伤脑筋？ +
-一直赞美他粗大的那话儿 -更正，他粗大好看的那话儿 +
-现在流行说那话儿了？ -我没办法加上形容词 +
一句简单的“你好硬” 通常十分有效 +
有时候男人需要一点鼓励 +
-譬如说？ -你知道的，          “没错” +
“不要停，就是那样 快点，不要停” +
-你在开玩笑吧？ -不，他们很喜欢 +
你的意思是 做爱时你完全沉默不语？ +
不，我在高潮前会有反应 +
“我快到了…” 但那是因为我真的快到了 +
其他的话感觉上都很虚伪 +
如果你真的喜欢他 你就得开始淫声浪语了 +
米兰达是对的吗？ 我们如此强调坦白和诚实 +
以至于跨越了礼貌的界线吗？ +
感情世界里是否仍有某些 绝不能说出口的话？ +
我最好的朋友跟一个 我所见过最没用的窝囊废订婚 +
我该说什么？ “你要嫁给一个笨蛋”？ +
我太太动了两次胸部整形手术 看起来很棒，但触感极差 +
这我没告诉她 +
我单身，38岁，还抱着 结婚的希望，我不想听实话 +
我告诉理查我无法和一个 蛮横的男人做夫妻 +
她来了，吃着饼干 +
证明我太多话的女人 站在我面前 +
-发生什么事了？ -话匣子一开便不可收拾 +
他说在我们的婚礼上 他看着我 +
觉得很失望 因为我长相如此平凡 +
我就说“再想一想，我觉得 生发剂对你根本没效” +
他说如果我离开 他对我只会感到同情 +
因为他会在一年内再婚 而我将孤独终老 +
我不想告诉她 那句话可能是事实 +
我真的要好好谢谢你 +
要不是你 我不会有勇气这么做 +
过去几年我好像被软禁一样 现在我自由了 +
你打算怎么办？ +
-今晚我能住你家吗？ -当然可以 +
当晚苏珊雪伦占据了我的沙发 +
而夏绿蒂回家拥抱 她人生中的新男性 +
她受够寂寞早晨、孤枕难眠的 夜晚和缺乏无条件的爱 +
夏绿蒂决定 一切要掌握在自己手中 +
她搜遍全市寻找完美的物种 +
有教养、体面又时髦 +
亨利，我回家了 +
小乖乖，亨利，好狗儿 +
在找到完美的男人以前 夏绿蒂先养只完美的狗 +
那晚 向来不擅长保守秘密的莎曼珊 +
发现她不能说出口的话 却一直盘据在她脑海 +
甜心，有什么不对劲吗？ 我希望你告诉我 +
-亲爱的，没有，我累了 -你变得好冷淡 +
-你好像在生我的气 -抱歉，跟你无关是我的问题 +
我没有在气任何事，你很好 +
你愿意陪我去找感情顾问吗？ +
莎曼珊畏惧心理医生的程度 就跟大部分人怕看牙医一样 +
-如果这真的对你很重要… -太好了 +
晚安 +
她突然渴望 感情空窗期的单身生活 +
以及火热的一夜情 +
与此同时 米兰达成了“窈窕淫娃”中的 +
女主角依莉莎杜利朵 +
我好喜欢亲吻这边的性感带 +
-你喜欢吗？ -喜欢 +
-告诉我你喜欢什么？ -那个 +
你喜欢我用手爱抚你的胸部吗 +
-当然 -轻轻捏你的乳头？ +
很好 +
亲吻我的胸膛 好舒服，那真的让我好兴奋 +
-觉得怎么样？热吗？ -热 +
-还有呢？ -胸毛浓密？ +
老天，你让我勃起了 +
-告诉我它是什么感觉 -大？ +
-还有呢？ -硬 +
-像石头般硬 -对，说下去 +
-大石头… -很好 +
坚硬的石头 +
-一个坚硬的大石头 -太好了 +
-一根香肠 -宝贝，你真下流 +
出乎意料地，米兰达一开了口 就发现很难闭嘴 +
一根巨大、会震动 石头般坚硬的香肠 +
那天晚上我带苏珊雪伦 去见夏绿蒂生命中的新男性 +
一如往常 它已经远低于她的高期望 +
-一分钟前它做得到 -它反覆无常 +
-去捡球 -自私、固执 +
-而且无可救药地相互依赖 -它很聪明吧？ +
我们不该待太久 我想回去以免理查打电话来 +
你不是离开他了？ +
没错，但我想告诉他 我不想跟他说话 +
那是消极的主动 真的有事要说才跟他讲话 +
-我嫁给一个混帐 -当时你不知道他是个混帐 +
我不敢相信那混帐还没打来 +
他确实有温柔的一面 你跟他不熟 +
你认为我做对了吗？亨利？ 还是我应该给他… +
它是一只狗，不是先知 +
隔天早上起床，我收到一个 令人不安的生日惊喜 +
来了 +
在这里签名 +
谢谢 +
我的天 +
-“诚挚献上生日祝福” -是大人物送的 +
-什么花？ -红玫瑰 +
一大束，很贵 你们觉得那是什么意思？ +
-表示“把卡片撕碎” -小心花上的刺 +
-不，这是个重大的宣示 -重大的宣示？ +
若你和某人分手而他就此消失 那么你们真的不该在一起 +
但若他做出强有力的爱情宣示 你就得重新考虑了 +
一束玫瑰花加上祝福卡片 就成了重大宣示？ +
男人绝对不会说“我错了” 他们送花来道歉 +
-有时候玫瑰就只是玫瑰 -如果是珠宝…那就另当别论 +
不行，亨利，不可以咬皮包 +
我的生日不需要这个 那代表什么？轮到我发球？ +
我不想玩游戏 +
这不是重大的宣示 这是暧昧的宣示 +
比完全没宣示还糟 +
-其实他一直很自私… -我同意，他存心捣乱… +
你们疯了 他在她生日时送花你们却骂他 +
-亨利，不可以，该死… -饶了那只狗吧 +
它已经咬烂我四双鞋 不能让它转移目标到皮包上 +
该死，我们回家去 +
你想出来活动得先学好规矩 再见 +
-你得学着听话… -说到发疯… +
夏绿蒂即将见识到 亨利的真面目 +
但她的确提出一个问题 “我错了”这句话 +
真让大人物说不出口吗？ +
我们分手并不表示 我无法以礼相待 +
-喂？ -是我，凯莉 +
-你好吗？ -很好 +
我想谢谢你送花给我 你真体贴 +
我秘书记在她的行事历上了… +
所以是你秘书送的？ +
不，是我送的 她提醒我是今天 +
你跟她都很体贴 +
不客气，你今天要做什么？ +
史丹佛要在那间摩洛哥式餐厅 举行派对，你应该来的 +
那些话一出口我就后悔了 +
-我已经有计划了… -不来没关系，无所谓 +
-晚一点我可以去看看 -好，随便你 +
-我可能会带某个人去 -好… +
带那个人一起来 晚上见，再次谢谢你 +
我刚邀请前任男友和他的女伴 来参加我的生日派对 +
仿佛老了一岁还不够悲惨似的 +
当天下午在费玛鲁丁的办公室 她是著名的心理学家 +
也是“探索”这本书的作者 是配偶间亲密关系的指南 +
莎曼珊尽力克制自己不要说出 她知道不该说的话 +
-我们没有性生活了 -一切正常不是吗？过一阵子 +
-多久了？ -一个月 +
别看得这么严重 好好享受性行为本身 +
-你们试过性爱游戏吗？ -莎曼珊想坦白说 +
詹姆斯的命根子从他们 认识的那天起便一直玩捉迷藏 +
我只是最近没什么性欲 +
我洗澡出来时看到你在自慰 +
很多女人在性交时 无法达到高潮 +
-这没什么好难为情 -你对做爱有很大的障碍 +
-不是那样 -不然是什么？ +
没什么 +
你有什么感受尽管说 我不会在意的 +
时间到了 +
不错，你们很努力 下周同一时间好吗？ +
我可以，莎曼珊？ +
想到每周固定 要向费玛鲁丁报到 +
让莎曼珊无法忍受 +
-你的命根子太小了 -你说什么？ +
它不能… +
我办不到 它…它实在是太小了 +
你有没有想过 也许是你的阴道太大了？ +
-我能说什么？我需要大老二 -我听到了 +
当莎曼珊为说了不该说的话 付出代价时 +
米兰达发现自由发言的代价 伴随着发言本身而来 +
我喜欢把手放在你的那话儿上 +
-我喜欢听你说“那话儿” -你大而坚硬的那话儿 +
那话儿… +
我以前为何说不出口？ 它只不过是一个词 +
为什么我说的时候 会让我们两个都兴奋起来？ +
-你还喜欢什么？ -你粗鲁的方式 +
当你把我的双腿举高 跨过你的头时，我便失去控制 +
-我喜欢什么？ -你喜欢我咬你的乳头 +
-还有呢？ -你喜欢我亲吻你的蛋蛋 +
继续说 +
你更喜欢我把手指 伸进你的屁眼 +
-你说什么？ -你喜欢手指在你的屁眼里 +
我怎么知道 “你喜欢手指在你的屁眼里” +
是不能在床上对男人说的话？ +
-不只那句话 -可是他很享受 +
-很多男人都这样 -你不能提醒他们这一点 +
我个人是不喜欢 屁眼里有任何东西 +
-我知道你们会很惊讶… -我觉得被出卖了 +
他试着要我讲些淫声浪语 +
我学会了，然后他却把我推开 +
男人真是反覆无常 所以我才爱我的亨利 +
-它充满热情，还会舔我的脸 -你可能太着迷了 +
给寿星再来一杯 加冰块的双份伏特加 +
伏特加是我唯一的盟友 大人物随时会… +
带着他迷人的女伴走进来 对我微笑说着… +
生日快乐，宝贝 +
-很高兴你能赶上 -无法待很久，骆驼在外面等 +
-你记得杰克吧？ -杰克？你要带的人就是他？ +
-我没有意识到… -见到你真好 +
-你最近怎么样？ -妙不可言，婆娘伤了我的心 +
-起码她没骗走我的钱 -祝我生日快乐 +
一小时后我“天方夜谭”式的 生日派对变成了“午夜快车” +
-你好吗？ -好极了，你呢？ +
-也很好 -那好 +
-你生日前男友来干嘛？ -我邀他来喝杯东西 +
我没想到他会为了艳舞留下来 +
-你有没有吃过茄子沙拉？ -我不吃茄子沙拉 +
你不知道错过了何等美味 +
我不敢相信他竟然有脸来 +
我不敢相信那女人的肚脐功夫 +
我即将失去我的蒸丸子 +
当我望着我的前男友 欣赏一场美索不达米亚式艳舞 +
苏珊雪伦对“妙不可言先生” 展开疲劳轰炸 +
我不知道能否再适应单身生活 我们的婚姻有高潮也有低潮 +
我丈夫和我可能放假时 相聚的时间太少 +
我们两个都睡眠不足 话说回来，哪对夫妻不是如此 +
我从没想过自己会离婚 +
耕耘自己的土壤 比寻找更青绿的牧草地重要… +
你有没有闭嘴的时候？ +
在那一刻她才发现 她有多么想念她的丈夫 +
当天晚上夏绿蒂回家发现 一个非常不愉快的意外等着她 +
天啊… +
亨利… +
你这坏狗… +
跟之前的许多男人一样 亨利在她完美世界里到处拉屎 +
它和夏绿蒂很快就分道扬镳 +
而她永远不能说 “我把宠物赶走了” +
我们都知道它后来的际遇为何 +
它是苏珊和丈夫 重修旧好的大功臣 +
闭嘴，快给我闭嘴 +
虽然他们都不愿承认 一只狗救了他们的婚姻 +
我的生日派对结束时 已是凌晨时份 +
我发现我和大人物两个人 单独在街上漫步 +
-又老了一岁 -却没长智慧 +
人生就是如此 +
-我送你回家好吗？ -我搭计程车就行了 +
-需要计程车钱吗？ -不用了，我有 +
还好，我想我把所有20块 钞票都塞给那肚皮舞者了 +
-那么？ -那么？ +
再见 +
再见 +
看着他离去，我明白 我不能对大人物说的话是… +
“我还是忘不了你” +
