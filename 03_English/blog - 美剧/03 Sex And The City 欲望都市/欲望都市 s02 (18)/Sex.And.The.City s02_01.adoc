'''

When you live on a tiny island like Manhattan... +
the odds of bumping into the one who broke your heart +
are incredibly high. +
The odds of bumping into him when you look like shit +
are even higher. +
After a break-up, certain streets, locations, +
even times of day are off limits. +
The city becomes a deserted battlefield +
loaded with emotional land mines. +
You have to be very careful where you step +
or you could be blown to pieces. +
Get your coat on, Anne Frank, we're going out. +
-You guys, I'm really not in the mood. -Coat on... +
-Body out. -Where are we going? +
It's a surprise. +
Okay, but only if it's nowhere I can run into him. +
Just when exactly do you think +
you're gonna be getting out of this hostage situation? +
Miranda! -What, am I wrong? +
Don't listen to her, Carrie, it's only been a month. +
It takes half the total time you went out with someone +
to get over them. +
I always like a good math solution to any love problem. +
It's the break-up rule. +
You and Big only went out for a year. +
So that means that she's got five more months to get over him. +
No, you got to cut your losses and get back in the game. +
When Eric and I broke up, I got over him right away. +
Well, I don't really remember it being like that. +
What? Eric who? +
Eric, asshole I dated a couple years ago. +
Oh, that Eric. +
Miranda used to call Eric the love of her life +
until he left her for another woman. +
Now, she almost never mentioned him. +
You can't push yourself into feeling good. +
The only way to get over somebody is to feel really bad, +
to cry to your girlfriends, +
and then to replay what you hated about him +
over and over in your head all day. +
Yep, that sounds about right. +
You're way too dressed up for where we're going. +
Well, you know what, I'm going to risk overdress versus the chance of +
meeting with Big for the first time looking the way I feel. +
Oh, God, seeing someone for the first time is the worst, +
you never know how to act. +
Yeah, and then there's the vomiting. +
You know what? If Big had any class, he would have moved away. +
I was here first. +
You're giving him way too much power. +
You broke up with him, remember? +
Yeah, right, right. +
And that makes me what, happy? +
Taxi! +
Amazingly, Samantha was still with James. +
A monogamous relationship for a woman whose bedroom +
was usually busier than Balducci's on a Saturday. +
Hey, you lovebirds. +
Oh... +
And how are the most beautiful women in Manhattan? +
If we see them, I'll ask. +
Have a fun day. +
And don't let anything bad happen to my princess. +
Oh. +
I love you. +
God, Samantha, everything is going so great. +
Me, James, and his tiny penis, +
we're one big happy family. +
After two months, despite all his sweetness and charm, +
Samantha still hadn't quite accepted James's... shortcomings. +
When Miranda said, "Get back in the game," she meant it. +
40 minutes and a $55 cab ride later, +
we found ourselves at Yankee Stadium. +
Who wants another? +
Miranda was a huge fan of the Yankees. +
I was a huge fan of being anywhere you could smoke +
and drink at two in the afternoon without judgment. +
-Beer! -Beer! +
-Do they have hot cocoa? -Okay. +
Coming up to bat, the new Yankee. +
Just up from the minors, single. +
Oh, so cute. +
I can barely see him. +
Why are we sitting all the way up here? +
Because it's the only place I can smoke without Giuliani +
putting me away for ten years. +
These seats suck. +
This hot dog sucks. +
My entire life sucks. +
Your life doesn't suck. +
You have a man who really loves you. +
Oh, yay, love. Woo! +
I don't think you ladies understand the seriousness +
of my situation. +
How would you like to make love to this every night? +
Is it kosher? +
Don't make me laugh. +
It's tragic. +
Can we all just try and get into the game for a second? +
-Alright. -C'mon! +
Show us what you got! +
Last year, this guy was Mr. September. +
He hit like, ten home runs in nine days. +
Ball! +
Good eye, good eye. +
Way to watch them. +
He batted 373. +
He drove in 47 runs. +
His on-base percentage was 410. +
As Miranda went on and on about the new Yankees' stats, +
I couldn't help but wonder about my own. +
Ten years playing in New York. +
Countless dates. +
Five real relationships. +
One serious. +
All ending in breakups. +
If I were a ball player, +
I'd be batting, uh... whatever really bad is. +
-Woo! +
Oh, my God. Here it comes! +
Oh, my God. +
Ah! +
Grab it! +
You got it! You got it! +
You know what the odds of catching a fly ball are? +
I didn't. +
But I couldn't help but wonder if they were any higher +
than finding a relationship that would last. +
Three innings, four beers +
and one shameless flash of my press pass later, +
we waited outside the locker room +
to get my ball signed by the new Yankee. +
Hi, good game. +
Did you see that bulge? +
Uh, he was wearing a cup. +
Well, honey, his cup runneth over. +
Okay, it's official. You're drunk. +
Oh, I'm not drunk, I'm sedated from my pain. +
She's allowed to be drunk, she's going through a break-up. +
Good game. +
Oh! Hey, hi. +
Excuse me. +
Huge Yankee fan. We don't mean to bother you, +
but my friend caught your ball. +
This is her. +
I'm her friend. +
Hi. +
And we were wondering if you'd sign it? +
Oh, the, the foul ball to the upper deck? +
Yes. +
I mean, yes. +
If it's not too-- +
I'm a huge Yankee fan. +
I'm a lawyer. +
So, if I don't sign it, you'll sue me? +
No. No! I don't know why I said that. +
No problem, give me the ball. +
-Give him the ball. -Oh. +
-Could you hold these? -Sure. +
Thank you. +
You a Yankee fan too? +
Actually, no, I came for the beer. +
I think baseball's a little dull. +
Oh, yeah? +
What do you do? +
She writes a column. +
A sex column. +
Nothin' dull about that. +
You'd be surprised. +
Here you go. +
Thank you. +
Wooh! +
He's so cute. +
I'm gonna ask him to the Dolce & Gabbana party. +
What? +
No, really, you can't. +
Yankee! Yankee! +
I don't know if it was the beer or the fact +
that I was holding his ball. +
Something gave me the strength to ask the new Yankee out. +
No, no, no. This is not fair. +
This is not the way this is supposed to happen. +
What? You told me to get back in the game. +
Yeah, with some balding CPA or other boring rebound guy. +
Nobody rebounds with the new Yankee. +
Well, maybe I'm the new Carrie. +
C'mon, ladies, let's blow this hot dog stand. +
C'mon. +
Samantha, let's go. +
She knew it was risky. +
But a day of watching big men swing their big wooden bats +
proved to be too much for Samantha. +
She told herself there's no harm in just looking. +
Can I help you? +
Uh... Um... +
As my ballpark cheap beer buzz wore off, +
I began to worry about the ramifications of my day. +
Was Charlotte right? +
Were we supposed to get over an ex in a slow, painful way? +
Or should we just ignore all the bad feelings +
and throw ourselves back in the game? +
In a world where leaving each other +
seems to be getting more and more frequent, +
what are the break-up rules? +
Whatever you do, man, don't cry. +
'Cause if you do get back together again, +
then, like, you're the guy that cried. +
Don't call or see him till three months have passed. +
That's how long it takes to lose the weight +
you put on when you were breaking up. +
Give her whatever she wants, +
but don't sign a motherfucking thing. +
Change your name, change your phone number. +
Change your job. +
They're all bums. +
-You got a problem? +
-No, no. -Huh? +
Friday night, the Dolce & Gabbana party, +
the new Yankee was ten minutes late. +
I was running 20 behind. +
Oh, come on. +
I was reaching for my favorite necklace when... +
I thought I'd destroyed all the evidence. +
But there it was. +
We'd taken it with a disposable camera before it ever +
dawned on me that we could be disposable as well. +
It was then and there I created my own very first break-up rule. +
Destroy all pictures where he looks sexy +
and you look happy. +
The party was a complete home run. +
All the fashion heavy hitters were there. +
Oh, c'mon, honey. +
Paul. +
Charlotte was dating Paul Erickson, +
the VP of a major recording label's +
classical and jazz division. +
Are you ladies having a good time? Here you go. +
-Oh, yeah. -You're not gonna believe it. +
This guy's never heard Miles Davis. +
I don't really like that jazz stuff. +
Stuff? Oh, you just wait. +
I'm gonna give you our Best of Miles Davis CD. +
The stuff's gonna change your mind. +
His concentration and emotion in the phrasing... +
Oh, man. It's fucking magical. +
He was handsome, smart, eclectic. +
The perfect match for Charlotte. +
Except for one minor snag. +
I mean, the authenticity of Miles' timbre... +
is gonna blow you away. +
I mean, the fusion revolution, it changed the entire concept +
of contemporary music. +
There we were, two single gals out on the town +
with our ballplayers. +
What's wrong? +
Just thought I saw... +
Where? +
No, no, it wasn't him. It wasn't him. +
Do you think he'll be here? +
I don't know, I hadn't thought about it. +
Break-up rule +
lie, it's a lot easier than admitting that's why you invited +
the new Yankee and why you maxed out your credit card +
to buy the dress. +
When Mr. Big never made an appearance, +
I decided to make the best of it. +
I actually got to know a little about this new Yankee. +
His name was Joe. +
So, Joe... +
the new Yankee, +
how'd you like your first fashion party? +
It's kind of cool. +
What? +
Nothing. It's just... +
"Kind of cool." +
You're very succinct. +
What, are you making fun of me? +
A little bit. +
Well, you're kind of cute. +
You're kind of cute, too. +
And there, in the shadow of my island, +
just four weeks out of my last relationship, +
I let the new Yankee get to first base. +
Our Saturday morning ritual, +
coffee, eggs, and a very private dish session. +
Except today our dish wasn't so private. +
You're on Page Six. +
-Mm! -Oh, my god! +
"Hot Yankee, Joe Stark on town with New York columnist, +
and 'sex-pert,' Carrie Bradshaw." +
"Sex-pert," huh? It's a proud day for me. +
Oh, honey, that dress just paid for itself. +
Big is gonna see this and die. +
I don't want him to die. +
Oh, cut the shit, it's me. +
You're using that Yankee. +
Okay, everybody has got to look +
at my new Palm Pilot. It's amazing. +
-It has my entire schedule... -This is so great. +
The first time Big sees you, you look like that +
and you're with the Yankee. +
Why are we still talking about him? +
He hurt her. +
He's out of the picture, it's over. +
Let's talk about something else, okay? +
-Okay. -Okay. +
Okay. +
I have a problem with my boyfriend. +
Okay, I'm gonna go get the check. +
I don't know really quite how to say this. +
But he's always, um, touching his, um... +
Balls. I know, Carrie told me. +
I had to, it freaked me out. +
I didn't know what the hell was going on there. +
I still don't. +
What is going on there? +
I don't know, but it's constant. +
He just can't seem to leave them alone. +
He and every other guy on the planet. +
They're always trying to pull our attention down there. +
Look what I got. +
I don't get it. He's from a good family. +
He went to Brown. +
Why is he doing that? +
Does he have a pair of low-hangers? +
Is that a patented phrase? +
You know, sometimes they just hang so low, they get in the way. +
I heard Nick Nolte had a ball lift. +
I don't know how long they are. +
Wait a minute. +
You've been dating this guy for three weeks +
and you haven't seen his balls yet? +
Oh, come on, get with the program. +
But why do men do this? +
I mean, how would they feel if we stood around in public +
touching ourselves? +
-They'd love it. -They'd love it. +
What are we talking about? +
Charlotte's boyfriend's balls. +
Seriously? +
They're too long. +
She's just guessing. +
Okay. +
That's it. +
I'm out of here. +
All we talk about anymore +
is Big, or balls, or small dicks. +
How does it happen that four such smart women +
have nothing to talk about but boyfriends? +
It's like 7th grade with bank accounts. +
What about us? +
What we think, we feel, we know. +
Christ. +
Does it always have to be about them? +
Just, you know... +
Give me a call when you're ready to talk about something besides +
men for a change. +
In the case of Miranda Hobbes +
versus silly women everywhere, +
the verdict was in. +
Guilty as charged. +
After breakfast, Charlotte and I went shopping. +
Break-up rule +
until emotionally stabilized, enter no stores. +
Later that night, Samantha and James +
were about to enter the 7th inning stretch. +
Okay, honey, now when I arch my back, +
I want you to lift that ass and really give it to me. +
Rather than quit mid-season, +
Samantha decided to attack her problem with the gusto +
of a seasoned coach training a rookie. +
Okay. Go, go, lift! +
Lift that ass. +
Give it to me. Give it to me! +
A good coach encourages and motivates. +
Oh, you are so hot. +
Oh, fuck me. +
Fuck me, you hot stud. +
A good coach disciplines and criticizes. +
No, what are you doing back there? +
Let's go! +
And like every good coach, +
she passed on the benefits of her years of experience. +
Okay, baby, I'm close. +
I want you to get up here and slide inside of me. +
Hurry, slide, slide, slide! +
Oh, yeah. +
Then, at the bottom of the 9th try, +
with two balls and two strikes... +
the coach had no choice but to bring in a pinch hitter. +
What's that? +
It's my vibrator. +
I thought it would be fun. +
Well, I think just us might be more fun. +
I mean, that's not a problem, is it? +
But there was no joy in Mudville. +
Mighty Samantha had struck out. +
But a little further uptown, +
the ballgame was just getting started. +
-I have a present for you. -Mm. +
I thought you just gave me one. +
I was at Barneys today. +
And... +
Well... +
Here. +
Charlotte had decided a possible solution to her problem +
might be as simple as briefs versus boxers. +
The salesman said that these were the very best. +
They're like the wonder bra for men. +
They give good support, something about the pouch. +
We haven't even made love yet +
and you're already out shopping for me? +
Slow down. +
No, no, it's not like that-- +
It's, it's what? +
Well... +
But Charlotte couldn't bring herself to tell him +
the problem was foul balls. +
This is too fast. Way too fast. +
I mean, first comes the underwear. +
And then you move in. +
And then the next thing I know, you hate my music. +
And that was that. +
He broke it off after only three weeks. +
Charlotte, true to form, was over him in exactly +
a week and a half. +
Whenever Miranda was feeling stressed out, +
she went for a long walk. +
She'd lose herself in the places and faces and whatever was +
bothering her would somehow lift. +
But today, she would have no such luck. +
I mean, I really liked-- I really thought he liked me, why didn't he call me? +
And just when Miranda decided she was the only woman +
in New York with any real perspective on men... +
There he was. +
Eric Asshole. +
The former love of her life. +
Walking hand and hand with the woman he left her for. +
Somewhere between playing the Royals and the Red Sox, +
the new Yankee found a minute to teach me +
some dugout pastimes. +
One, two, three, toss. +
Oh, God. Shit. +
If you don't get this, +
-we don't move on to spitting. -Alright, here. Hold my beer. +
Center your head, now. +
Okay, wait. +
Back, back, back. +
Sorry. +
Break-up rule +
never stop thinking about him even for a moment... +
because that's the moment he'll appear. +
As he made his way through the crowd, I felt calm. +
I had accomplished the perfect first meeting. +
I looked good, I felt good, and I was with the new Yankee. +
Surprise, surprise. +
Well, look at you. +
I've been, um... I mean, I keep meaning... +
-How have you... -Good, good, good. +
Oh, God, sorry. This is Joe Stark. +
I know who he is. +
I'm a big fan. +
Good luck this season. +
Thanks. +
I saw your picture in the paper. +
You never looked better. +
You want another round? +
Hey, some buddies of mine are over at a bar on Bleecker. +
How about it? +
Sure. +
Hey... +
I'm sorry. +
I'm really sorry, it's not you. This is... +
This is really embarrassing. +
I'm sorry. +
-It's okay, it's okay. -I'm really embarrassed. +
-You're okay. -No, I don't think I'm okay. +
I just-- I just cried in your mouth. +
I just... +
I can't, uh... +
I'm just not-- I'm not ready, you know? +
That guy in the bar, that-- +
That... that suit guy. I just... +
I better go. Sorry. +
You want me to give you a ride home? +
No, Joe, please. Just don't pay any more attention to me. +
Alright? Just go, please. Just go to that bar thing. +
And I'm just gonna get a cab, alright? +
Just please. Will you just go? +
Alright, then I'll go. +
But I didn't go home. +
I couldn't. +
I went to a pay phone. +
Hey, it's me. +
Hi, listen. +
I know things are really weird between us right now. +
But I really need to talk. +
Can you... +
Will you meet me at our place in like 15 minutes? +
Okay. +
Hi. +
I saw Big. +
And I completely fell apart. +
And I know you want me to be over him. I just-- +
I'm a jerk. +
That's my stuff. It's not you. +
I saw Eric on the street today. +
And I hid. +
After two years. +
I forgot how hard it is. +
You just take all the time you need, okay? +
These are cold. +
So? +
And finally, the most +
no matter who broke your heart or how long it takes to heal, +
you'll never get through it without your friends. +
欲望城市 +
（两性专家凯莉布雷萧） +
球场爱情学 +
当你住在像曼哈顿 这么小的岛上… +
遇见前任男友的机率出奇地高 +
当你面容憔悴时的机率 甚至会更高 +
分手之后，在某些街道 +
场所，甚至一天中某些时段 都得格外谨慎 +
这城市变成一个 遍布感情地雷的战场 +
你得步步为营 否则可能会粉身碎骨 +
-去穿外套，我们要出门 -我不想去… +
-我们要去哪里？ -这是个惊喜 +
除非是去不可能遇见他的地方 +
你何时才打算从这种囚禁的 处境中解脱？我说错了吗？ +
别听她瞎说，才一个月而已 +
忘掉旧情人 需要和他交往时间的一半 +
我一向喜欢用数学 来处理感情问题 +
这是分手定律，你们交往一年 所以她还需要五个月 +
才怪，要忍痛割舍，重返球场 +
-我马上就把艾瑞克抛在脑后 -我印象中好像不是这样 +
-哪个艾瑞克？ -几年前我交往的一个混蛋 +
米兰达曾称艾瑞克是一生挚爱 直到他另结新欢而离开 +
现在她几乎不再提到他 +
你不能勉强自己快乐 +
忘记前男友的唯一办法就是 经历十足痛苦，向朋友哭诉 +
然后脑中整天不断复述 他可恨之处 +
那方法还不赖 +
你太盛装打扮了 +
我宁愿冒险，免得我 黯然神伤的模样让大人物看见 +
第一次和前男友见面 总会让人手足无措 +
没错，然后便开始反胃 +
大人物若是有风度便会离开 是我先到的 +
你对他过于让步，是你甩了他 +
-而我…怎样，开心了吗？ -计程车 +
令人惊奇的是 莎曼珊仍在和詹姆斯交往 +
一个周六时闺房比瓦杜西的 卧室还忙碌的女人 +
正在谈一对一的恋爱 +
你们这对相思鸟 +
曼哈顿最美丽的女人们好吗？ +
如果有看到她们，我会问候 +
祝你们玩得愉快，别让任何 坏事发生在我的公主身上 +
我爱你 +
老天，莎曼珊 一切都进展得好顺利 +
我、詹姆斯和他的小命根子 我们是一个快乐的大家庭 +
过了两个月 尽管他既温柔又有魅力 +
莎曼珊还是无法接受 詹姆斯的“短处” +
当米兰达说“重返球场”时 她是认真的 +
40分钟车程再加上55块 车费后，我们置身洋基球场 +
-谁还要一杯？ -米兰达是洋基队的死忠球迷 +
我则爱好任何可以抽烟 +
以及午后喝酒不受非议的地方 +
-啤酒… -这里有卖热可可吗？ +
好了，准备打击，洋基队新人 +
刚从小联盟升上来 单身，好可爱 +
我根本看不到他 我们为什么要坐在这里？ +
因为这里可以让我安心抽烟 不怕被市长驱逐出境十年 +
这椅子烂透了，热狗也烂透了 +
-我整个人生都烂透了 -你的人生并不烂 +
-你有个爱你的男人 -是，爱 +
我想你们不了解 我情况的严重性 +
你愿意每晚 跟这么小的玩意儿做爱吗？ +
干不干净？ +
别逗我笑，这很可悲 +
你们能不能专心看比赛？ 加油，秀出你的实力来 +
去年这家伙当选九月之星 +
他在九天内击出十支全垒打… 坏球，守得好，看紧他们 +
他的打击率是0.373 攻下47分，上垒率是… +
米兰达继续数着那洋基新人的 辉煌战绩，我则回顾自己情史 +
在纽约打滚十年，阅人无数 谈了五次恋爱 +
一次很认真，全都以分手收场 +
我要是球员，我的表现… 真是差劲到家 +
-我的天 -球往这边飞来了 +
你接到了… +
你知道捡到高飞球的 机率是多少吗？ +
不知道，但会比找到一段 持久的感情高吗？ +
过了三局、灌了四瓶啤酒 加上厚颜无耻使用记者通行证 +
我们在更衣室外等着拿我的球 给那洋基新人签名 +
-比赛很精彩 -你看到那凸起吗？ +
-他穿了护套（杯子） -亲爱的，他的杯子满出来了 +
-好了，你们喝醉了 -不，我正静静承受痛苦 +
她有资格喝醉 她正经历失恋阵痛期 +
抱歉，我是洋基队死忠球迷 很抱歉打扰你 +
我朋友捡到你的球…就是她 +
-我是她朋友 -不知道你能否签个名 +
-那界外球跑到观众席上方了 -对，如果不麻烦… +
我是洋基队死忠球迷 我是个律师 +
-我要是不签，你会告我吗？ -不会，不知道我说那个干嘛 +
-没问题，球给我 -球给他 +
能帮我拿一下好吗？谢谢 +
-你也是洋基球迷吗？ -不是，我是为了啤酒而来 +
-我觉得棒球有点无聊 -是吗？你做哪一行？ +
-她写专栏 -性爱专栏 +
-那可不无聊 -你会大感意外 +
-好了 -谢谢 +
他好可爱 +
我要邀他参加杜嘉班纳的派对 +
-不，你不能… -等一下… +
无论是因为啤酒 还是我手中正握着他的签名球 +
忽然给了我勇气约那球员出去 +
不…这太不公平了 事情不应该这样发展的 +
是你叫我重返球场的 +
没错，是和一些顶上无毛的 会计师或其他乏味的家伙 +
没人一重返球场 就钓到洋基新人 +
也许我是焕然一新的凯莉 走吧，我们去吃热狗 +
快来 +
莎曼珊，走吧 +
她知道这很冒险 但是看着壮硕的男人 +
晃动着他们的大木棒走来走去 莎曼珊实在难以抵挡 +
她告诉自己 “看一下无伤大雅” +
有事吗？ +
我… +
在“棒球场与廉价啤酒”的 激情逐渐消退后 +
我开始担心现实生活中 错综复杂的难题 +
夏绿蒂说对了吗？我们应该 缓慢、痛苦地度过失恋期？ +
还是干脆忽视痛苦 重返情场？ +
在一个分手似乎变成 家常便饭的时代 +
分手定律有哪些？ +
无论如何，老兄，不要哭 +
如果你们真的复合 你就是那个哭过的人 +
三个月之内不要打电话 或跟他见面 +
你需要这么长的时间 减掉因失恋而增加的体重 +
她要什么都答应 但绝不签任何文件 +
把名字、电话和工作都换了 男人都是无赖 +
你们有意见吗？ +
星期五晚上，杜嘉班纳的派对 +
那洋基新人迟到十分钟 害我晚了二十分钟 +
正当我伸手拿最爱的项练时… +
我以为我毁灭了所有的证据 但它却出现了 +
这是用即可拍相机照的 +
我从来没想过 我们的感情也能用完就丢 +
当下我立了第一条分手定律 +
毁掉所有他看来性感 而自己显得幸福的照片 +
这派对盛大无比，所有时尚界 赫赫有名的人物都齐聚一堂 +
亲爱的，快过来，保罗 +
夏绿蒂正和保罗艾瑞森约会 +
他是一家大型唱片公司 古典爵士乐部门的副总裁 +
-你玩得开心吗？ -他没听过迈尔士戴维斯的歌 +
-我不太喜欢爵士乐那玩意儿 -玩意儿？ +
我送你一张“戴维斯精选辑” 它将会让你改变心意 +
他在分句上对情感的专注 简直是出神入化 +
他英俊、聪明、体贴 和夏绿蒂非常相配 +
-除了一个小缺点 -迈尔士的真实… +
绝对令你折服 我是说，融合革命 +
完全颠覆了当代音乐的概念 +
就这样，我们两个单身女子 和护花使者一起出席派对 +
-怎么了？ -我以为我看到他了 +
-在哪里？ -不是他 +
-你认为他会在这里吗？ -我没想过 +
分手定律第二条：谎言 +
这比承认 这就是邀约那洋基球员 +
以及为此买新衣服 刷爆信用卡的原因容易多了 +
既然大人物始终没出现 我决定善加利用这个机会 +
我对这洋基新人有点认识了 他的名字叫乔 +
乔，洋基队新人，你觉得你的 第一个时尚派对如何？ +
-蛮酷的，怎么了？ -没有，只是… +
蛮酷的，非常简洁 +
-你在取笑我吗？ -有一点 +
-那么…你蛮可爱的 -你也蛮可爱的 +
于是，在夜色笼罩之下 +
上一段恋情结束四个星期后 +
我让那洋基新人上了一垒 +
我们每周六的例行早餐会 咖啡、蛋和私密话题的讨论 +
-今天的话题不怎么私密 -你上了第六版 +
-我的天 -性感的洋基队球员乔史塔克 +
与纽约性爱专栏作家 凯莉布雷萧一起现身 +
-真是光荣 -为那件洋装花的钱值得了 +
-大人物看到这个会气死 -我不想他死 +
少来了，跟我还装蒜 你在利用那个洋基球员 +
你们一定得瞧瞧 我新的数位助理，它棒呆了 +
太好了，大人物第一次见到你 便是你容光焕发和棒球员约会 +
我们为什么还在谈他？ 他伤害过她，跟我们不相干了 +
-谈谈别的吧 -好 +
好 +
-我男友有个小问题 -我去买单 +
我不知道该怎么启齿 他总是一直… +
-摸他的… -蛋蛋，我知道，凯莉说了 +
这举动吓坏我了，不知道下面 有什么毛病，到底怎么了？ +
我不知道 他似乎无法不理睬它们 +
男人总是想吸引我们注意下面 看着他们引以为豪的宝贝 +
他家世良好，布朗大学毕业 为什么会有这种行为？ +
-他下面有一对挂勾吗？ -这已成为专有名词了吗？ +
有时它们垂得太低还会碍事 听说尼克诺特还因此动手术 +
-我不知道他的多长 -慢着 +
你跟他交往了三周 还没见过他的蛋蛋？ +
-拜托，快点行动吧 -男人怎么会这样？ +
如果我们公然抚摸自己 他们会作何感想？ +
-他们爱死了 -你们在聊什么？ +
-夏绿蒂男友的睾丸 -真的？ +
-它们太长了 -她只是猜测 +
够了，到此为止，我要走了 +
我们不是谈大人物 就是睾丸或小命根子 +
为什么四个聪明的女人 只有男朋友这话题可聊？ +
好像国中生，只不过 有工作收入，那我们呢？ +
我们的想法、感受和见解呢？ 难道永远得和男人有关？ +
等你们想聊别的话题再找我吧 +
米兰达控告笨女人一案 +
判决揭晓，笨女人有罪 +
吃完早餐后夏绿蒂和我去逛街 +
分手定律第三条 +
在情绪稳定前不进任何商店 +
当晚 莎曼珊和詹姆斯准备进入 +
第七局上下半局间 +
当我拱起背时 我要你抬起臀部勇往直前 +
不愿在球季中途认输退出 莎曼珊决定对症下药 +
以一个经验丰富教练的热情 调教一位菜鸟 +
冲…臀部抬高 +
给我… +
好教练会鼓励和激发球员斗志 +
你真棒，上我吧… 你这性感猛男 +
好教练也会责备和批评 +
你在后面干嘛？快点 +
跟所有好教练一样 她传授岁月累积而成的经验 +
好，宝贝，我快要高潮了 往前冲，滑进我体内，滑吧… +
我来了 +
九局下半，球数两好两坏 +
教练别无选择 只有派代打者上场 +
-那是什么？ -是我的电动按摩棒 +
-我想那会很好玩 -我认为只有我们比较好玩 +
没问题吧？ +
小联盟毫无乐趣可言 莎曼珊三振出局了 +
但在上城，球赛才刚开始 +
-我要送你一个礼物 -你不是已经送我了 +
今天我去巴尼百货…给你 +
夏绿蒂决定问题的解决之道 +
也许只在于穿三角裤 或四角裤那么简单 +
店员说这个牌子最好 +
就像男人用的魔术胸罩 可以提供睾丸很好的支撑 +
我们都还没做爱 你就帮我买东西了，慢下来 +
-不，不是那样的 -不然是怎样？ +
但夏绿蒂无法告诉他 问题出在他的“界外球” +
进展太快了，先是帮我买内裤 +
然后你便要搬过来 接着你连我听什么音乐都要管 +
就这样，只交往三周 他就和她分手了 +
而夏绿蒂依照定律 一个半星期就把他忘了 +
每当米兰达感觉压力很大时 她便会去散步 +
她在人来人往的街道上神游 +
任何困扰她的事便会烟消云散 +
但今天她的运气没那么好了 +
我真的以为他喜欢我 他为什么不打电话给我？ +
正当米兰达认为 自己是纽约唯一 +
真正看清男人的女人时… +
他却出现了，混蛋艾瑞克 她的前任男友 +
和那个新欢手牵手走在一起 +
在皇家队和红袜队打球的空档 +
洋基小子教我一些 球员休息时的消遣 +
-一、二、三，丢 -可恶 +
-你若学不会这招就无法继续 -拿着 +
-头摆正 -等等 +
-后面… -抱歉 +
分手定律第四条 绝不停止想他，片刻也不行 +
因为他就会在那一刻出现 +
他穿过人群走过来时 我内心平静 +
我们分手后的首次碰面 十分完美 +
我光鲜亮丽、心情愉快 身旁还有一个洋基小子 +
-真是意外 -瞧你神采奕奕的，我一直… +
-你最近好吗？ -很好 +
-天啊，抱歉，他是… -我知道，我是他的忠实球迷 +
-这球季祝你好运 -谢了 +
我在报上看见你的照片 +
你看起来更迷人了 +
你还想再来一杯吗？ +
有些朋友在布利克街的酒吧 要不要去？ +
-好 -凯莉 +
对不起 +
真的很抱歉，这跟你无关… +
-真的很丢脸，我很抱歉 -没关系 +
不，我不这么认为 我跟你接吻的时候哭出来 +
我只是…我无法… +
我只是…还没准备好 刚刚酒吧里那个男的… +
那个穿西装的 +
-我还是走好了 -需要我送你回家吗？ +
不，别管我了 拜托，你走吧… +
去找你朋友吧 我自己会拦计程车，好吗？ +
拜托，请你走好吗？ +
好吧，那我走 +
但我没有回家，我没办法 我走向公共电话 +
是我，听着 +
我知道现在我们之间很尴尬 但我真的需要找人说说话 +
你能在15分钟内 来我们平时聚会的餐厅吗？ +
好… +
嗨 +
我看见大人物了 而我完全无力招架 +
-我知道你希望我忘了他… -我是个混球 +
是我不对，与你无关 +
今天我在街上看见艾瑞克 结果我却躲起来，已经两年了 +
我忘了那有多难 你尽管慢慢来，好吗？ +
-薯条冷掉了 -那又怎样？ +
最后，最重要的分手定律是 +
无论是谁令你心碎 或需要多久来疗伤 +
没有朋友你绝对撑不下去 +
