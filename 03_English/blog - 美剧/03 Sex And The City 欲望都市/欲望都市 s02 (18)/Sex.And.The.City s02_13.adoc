'''

In a town where everyone's dying to couple up, +
sometimes there's nothing better +
than being out of a relationship. +
You have time to do your laundry. +
Freedom to play your favorite bad music really loudly. +
But the best part of being out of a relationship... +
Plenty of time to catch up with your friends. +
I feel sorry for Big, I really do, because... +
if you think about it, +
I was the best thing that ever happened to him. +
Actually, no, I pity him. +
Because I get to walk away and be me +
and he has to walk away and stay him, you know, +
and who wants to be him when you can be me? +
I mean, I'm smart, I'm funny. +
I was this thing, you know? I was it. +
I mean, I was this magic moment. +
I was the abracadab-- +
I was totally "the poof" in the relationship. +
I mean, +
I've got more poof in one finger +
than he could ever have. I mean, jeez, +
sometimes I poof just hailing a cab. +
So, I guess it's better to know now. +
So that I can go poof someone else. +
...someone who deserves me +
and not some screwed up, insecure guy +
who can't deal with a woman +
who's got her act together. +
Now, I'm gonna end up deliriously happy +
and Big is gonna die old and alone. +
And I pity him. +
Really, I pity him. +
What? +
Alright, who's gonna tell her? +
What? +
Honey, you're obsessed with talking about Big +
and frankly, we can't take it anymore. +
It's out of our league. +
What is this, an intervention? +
Yes, stop her before she obsesses again. +
Isn't part of the whole breaking up process +
that you get free reign to whine to your friends? +
Of course you do. +
But maybe you should think about whining to a shrink. +
Why should I pay someone when we can talk for free +
and then go get a drink or whatever? +
I don't need professional help, I've got you guys. +
Yeah, for about another ten minutes. +
And then we're cutting you off, cold turkey. +
Hey, I don't need therapy, I need new friends. +
Look, we're as fucked up as you are. +
It's like the blind leading the blind. +
Sometimes it helps to talk to somebody who's objective. +
Okay, I understand why you see a shrink, you know, +
'cause you're always in your head. +
But I'm fine. +
I am functioning. +
Besides, I don't really-- +
To be honest, I just don't buy the whole shrink thing. +
Neither do I. +
I mean, my parents believe that any head problem +
could be solved with physical exercise. +
That's why all of us are really good tennis players. +
It's a slippery slope. +
You know, first, you're going once a week, +
then it's three times a week. +
And then the next thing you know, +
you're starting your sentences with, +
"Well, my shrink says--" +
My shrink says that's a very common fear. +
Therapy... +
It's just so self indulgent. +
Ancient man didn't need shrinks to survive. +
Ancient man only lived till 30. +
Were my friends right? +
Had I crossed the line from pleasantly neurotic +
into annoyingly troubled? +
I decided to seek my own professional help. +
How can you not have a shrink? +
This is Manhattan. Even the shrinks have shrinks. +
The fact was, Stanford was right. +
The therapist was as ubiquitous in Manhattan +
as pirated cable. +
I have three. +
You do not. +
I do. +
One for when I want to be coddled. +
One for when I want tough love. +
And one for when I just want to look +
at a really beautiful man. +
Well, that's sick. +
Which is why I see the other two. +
Do you want a name? +
Oh, no, Miranda's shrink referred me to one. +
Uh... Dr. Ellen Greenfield. +
Dr. G! +
Oh, my God. +
She is hot, hot, hot. +
Gwyneth Paltrow sees her. +
Why does she go to a shrink? +
She suffers from high self-esteem. +
While I was contemplating the couch, +
Miranda was enjoying hers. +
Two nights later, +
she had another nocturnal rendezvous. +
Soon, Miranda found herself with a nightly playmate. +
A week later, I kept my date with Dr. G., +
celebrity shrink. +
So, Carrie, tell me why you're here. +
Well, my friends can't handle me anymore. +
They're like very expensive foster care. +
What's bothering them? +
They tell me that I talk about my ex-boyfriend too much. +
But that's normal, right, after a break-up? +
I don't like the term "normal". +
Oh, no, of course you don't. +
Because you wouldn't have any patients. +
So tell me about him. +
The ex. +
You know, uh... +
I have to be honest here. Um... +
I'm not sure I really believe in therapy. +
I'm more of a... +
"Solve your own problems" kind of gal. +
Okay. +
Ah... +
I don't know. +
He was smart. +
He was sexy, just totally screwed up. +
He was playing all these games. +
And I didn't know the rules. +
You were playing games. +
No, he was. +
I was just along for the ride. +
And what about you? +
Was this the first time you dated a man +
who couldn't give you what you wanted? +
Well, that's a little easy, don't you think? +
Okay. +
Yeah. +
Maybe I've dated men who were wrong for me, +
but who hasn't? +
But the thing they have in common... is you. +
What's your point? +
Maybe you are picking the wrong men. +
Well, of course you pick the wrong guys. +
Jesus, I could have told you that. +
Well, frankly, I think I picked the wrong therapist. +
I mean, she just did not get me at all. +
She thought I was a game player. +
Well, you have to be. +
It's the only way to deal with men. +
Oh, that's healthy. +
Relationships are not about games. +
They're about mature and honest communication. +
This coming from a woman +
who's playing peek-a-boo with her neighbor. +
Games are empowering. +
If you know what you're doing, +
you can totally control the situation. +
The only place you can control a man is in bed. +
If we perpetually gave men blow jobs, +
we could run the world. +
And at least our hands would be free to greet dignitaries +
and stuff. +
Excuse me. -Sorry. +
I mean, you know, even if you're in a relationship, +
you still have to play games. +
Yeah, Big and I played games, look where it got us. +
But maybe the game is not really over. +
Maybe it's just halftime. +
That kind of delusional thinking +
is why you should be in therapy, too. +
I do not pick the wrong guys, they pick me. +
So what, you're like a fly strip for dysfunctional men? +
Yeah, but one of those really pretty floral scented ones. +
It's slim pickings out there. +
You can't swing a Fendi purse +
without knocking over five losers. +
Where did all the great guys go? +
There it was. +
Happy hour in the valley of lost men. +
Whoa. +
I've never seen this many of them rounded up in one space. +
What's going on? +
It's sports night. +
It certainly is. +
C'mon, girls, let the games begin. +
Sports night. +
Every female's fantasy. +
A room full of captive heterosexual men +
all looking to be distracted during commercial breaks. +
I'm getting a contact high from all the testosterone. +
-We didn't order these. -Oh, no, they're on the house. +
It's sports night. Ladies drink for free. +
-Oh. -Forget Disneyland. +
This is the happiest place on earth. +
Yes, indeed. +
Mmm, If you ladies will excuse me. +
I'm getting off the bench. +
They certainly have the momentum going now! +
Pass the ball! Pass the ball! Pass the ball! +
Who's winning? +
Knicks. +
Is that good? +
You're not a Knicks fan, I take it. +
Not yet. +
I'm Don. +
Samantha. +
Don Siegler was a very successful importer +
of Mexican handbags. +
He was fanatical about +
keeping the price of foreign labor down +
and the Knicks. +
Maybe I could teach you a few things. +
And vice versa. +
There's ten seconds left. +
Pass, you motherfucker! +
Pass the ball! +
We need to penetrate, drive to the basket. +
Get it to Johnson, he's on fire tonight. +
Yes, go L.J., go! +
Go, score! +
Which is exactly what Samantha did two hours later. +
When I got home that night, +
I couldn't get Charlotte's words out of my head. +
We spent our childhoods playing games. +
Were they all just primers for the games we played as adults? +
Were relationships just a big chess match, +
strategy, moves, counter moves... +
all designed to keep your opponent off balance +
until you win? +
Was there such a thing as an honest relationship, +
or was it true? +
Do you have to play games to make a relationship work? +
I went out with this girl on Saturday night. +
We had a great time. +
So, I didn't call her again until Thursday. +
You know, so I didn't seem eager. +
I went out with this guy on Saturday night. +
I thought we had a great time. +
The asshole doesn't call me until Thursday. +
I screened his call and didn't return it until Monday. +
I gave my boyfriend an ultimatum. +
Propose by Christmas or it's over. +
My girlfriends said that was a game. +
I think it was just smart. +
Besides, if he doesn't come through, +
I can always secretly get pregnant. +
The next day, I reluctantly showed up for my second appointment with Dr. G. +
I was still a skeptic and I'd already read every New Yorker +
in their waiting room. +
When you think about it, +
what was I getting out of this anyway? +
And then at five minutes to my last scheduled hour, +
I got my answer. +
Hi. +
My third appointment with Dr. G. +
I had come a little early to catch up on my reading. +
Hi, I'm Seth. +
Oh. Hi, Carrie. +
I thought we could go on playing this coy game +
or I could actually introduce myself. +
Well, I'm glad you did. +
Especially since I had worn my new dress for the occasion. +
That New Yorker is from last year. +
Oh, well, this New Yorker is a little behind on her reading. +
So how long you been a Dr. G. convert? +
Not very long, just three sessions. +
I Just had my one-year anniversary. +
What'd she give you, a cake or something? +
A really big bill. +
Listen, this is gonna sound a little weird, but... +
Would you have dinner with me sometime? +
Sure. +
I'd like that. +
Yeah? Um... +
Call me, alright? +
Okay. +
Okay, maybe it was unethical making a date +
with Seth Robinson, photographer, +
in my shrink's waiting room, +
but there was something about him. +
Come on in, Carrie. +
Well, you're dressed up. +
He's a photographer. +
Hmm... +
And you met him at your shrink's? +
Well, it wasn't a set up or anything. +
Jeez, what if he's crazy? +
It's the crazy ones that have the good pills. +
Mmm, that's it! +
Go, Marcus! Go! +
Excuse me, but why is that on and who is Marcus? +
Marcus Camby, Knicks forward. Now that Ewing's been injured, +
he really needs to pull it out. +
And when did we start caring about basketball? +
Don is obsessed. +
I don't get laid unless the Knicks win. +
And can I just say, +
they and I have been on a very long losing streak. +
-Well, that's awful. -No kidding. +
The Knicks are the only ones who are getting screwed right now. +
C'mon, you fuckers. +
Why are you staying with him? +
Because the sex... +
What I can remember, it was unbelievable. +
Yes, yes! +
They won! +
Oh, they won! +
-I've got to go. -Go, go. +
Have sex. +
Go. +
The next night, Miranda got a pleasant surprise. +
Her date thought it was time they moved past peek-a-boo +
to playing doctor. +
Miranda wanted to play fair, +
so she gave him a little tit for tat. +
All over town, people were getting lucky. +
Seth and I were having a great first date at Coffee Shop. +
Oh, oh, and what about the plant? +
Oh, I know. +
She always has it in a different place. +
Maybe it's some sort of Dr. G. psychological test. +
That's it, it's "Where's Waldo?" +
Yeah. +
Oh, and it needs to be watered. +
It's plastic. +
Are you sure? +
-I touched it. +
You touched Dr. G's plant? +
I've been going to her over a year. +
I got bored. +
But then you came along. +
Well, that's sweet. +
No, it's true. +
There was something about him. +
I felt like I could talk to him about anything. +
And in the spirit of psychological health +
and not playing games, +
I decided to be honest. +
I like you. +
I like you, too. +
Later that week, Miranda went shopping for dinner. +
Shopping quickly devolved into a game of hide and seek. +
Hi. +
I thought I'd be an adult here +
and come over and introduce myself. +
Hi. +
I'm Miranda. +
You know? +
Across the air shaft. +
Oh, yeah. Right. +
You're the girl who lives above the guy +
I've been cruising. +
Miranda realized she was still playing +
with an imaginary friend. +
Just like she did when she was five. +
The next day she called her shrink for an emergency session. +
Meanwhile, Sam had decided she would celebrate the end of +
the basketball season and the return of her sex life +
by watching the final Knicks game at Don's. +
Sprewell steals the ball, +
hands it to Johnson who's gonna run out the clock... +
-Yeah, baby! +
Come here. +
In a minute, baby. +
The Mets are playing Chicago. +
Now that basketball is over, +
I can give 'em my full attention. +
Man, they've been playing lousy ball this year. +
The idea of lasting through another sexless season +
was more than Samantha could take. +
And so... +
she forfeited the game. +
Meanwhile, I was getting plenty of action. +
Seth and I had just come back from another amazing date. +
You want to come in? +
I think I already am. +
This is great. +
You have all the classics here. +
Clue, Parchesi, and Twister. +
I was the 7th grade Twister champion. +
-Is that a challenge? -Oh, yeah. +
Alright, buddy, it's go time. +
How you holding up? +
Feeling good, my friend. +
Feeling good. +
Left foot yellow. +
I guess that one's mine. +
You're in a very compromising position. +
I believe I'm in about 20 compromising positions. +
I am not gonna lose my concentration. +
In no time, it was "Yellow pants off." +
So, what do you think Dr. G. would have to say about this? +
Very bad. +
Bad patients. Bad, bad. +
I have to tell you. +
I'm not really into therapy, I think it's kind of bullshit. +
I'm telling Dr. G. on you. +
No, no, no, no. +
-Okay. -Cross your heart? +
Hope to die. +
So, why are you in therapy, seriously? +
I'm really fucked up about women. +
After I sleep with them, I completely lose interest. +
What about you, what's your problem? +
I believe in therapy +
this moment is called, "the breakthrough." +
I pick the wrong men. +
Although she had made some good points, +
I stopped seeing Dr. G. immediately. +
I couldn't risk the humiliation of running into Seth in the waiting room. +
My friends totally understand. +
欲望城市 +
（性爱专家凯莉布雷萧） +
“游戏人间” +
在一个人人都渴望 找个伴的城市中 +
有时没什么比从一段感情中 脱身更好的事 +
你有空洗衣服 +
把最棒的音乐 开得震天嘎响的自由 +
但最棒的还是 有许多时间和朋友叙旧 +
我为大人物难过 +
我是他交往过最好的对象 +
我同情他，我可以离开做自己 而他还是老样子 +
谁想跟他一样？ 我既聪明又风趣 +
我是完美的女人，独一无二 +
我是不可思议的一刻 就像咒语 +
我为这段感情注入魔力 +
我一根手指的魔力 比他全身上下加起来还多 +
有时我手一挥便能拦到计程车 +
现在知道了也好 这样我才能对别人施展魔力 +
吸引一个值得我爱的人 不是某个自大没安全感的家伙 +
无法应付一个沉稳自信的女人 +
我会一辈子幸福快乐 而大人物将会孤独终老 +
我可怜他，真的 +
-怎么了？ -好，谁要跟她说？ +
什么？ +
你满嘴谈的都是大人物 我们再也受不了了 +
我们根本插不上话 +
-这算是干涉吗？ -没错，别再想着他了 +
随时和朋友诉苦 +
不是分手过程中的一部分吗？ +
当然 +
也许你该考虑 去和心理医生吐苦水 +
我们可以免费聊天，喝杯东西 何必付钱给别人？ +
我不需要专业的协助 我有你们这些姐妹 +
-再给你十分钟 -然后我们便会打断你 +
我不需要心理治疗 我需要新朋友 +
我们和你一样失败 就像盲人瞎马，只会引入危途 +
有时和客观的人谈谈会有帮助 +
我了解你们为何去看心理医生 +
你们总是钻牛角尖 但我好得很，一切运作正常 +
此外，老实说 我不信心理医生那一套 +
我父母相信任何脑部毛病 +
可以藉着运动解决 +
这就是为什么 我们都很擅长打网球 +
这会让人越陷越深，刚开始 一周去一次，接着一周去三次 +
突然间你开口闭口都是 “我的心理医生说…” +
-我心理医生说那恐惧很平常 -心理治疗实在有些自我放纵 +
古人不靠心理医生也活得下去 +
-古人只活到30岁 -我的朋友们说对了吗？ +
我已从讨人喜欢的神经质 跨越到惹人厌的烦躁吗？ +
我寻求自己的专业协助 +
你没有心理医生？ +
在曼哈顿 连心理医生自己都有心理医生 +
史丹佛说得对，治疗师 和偷接的第四台一样无所不在 +
-我就有三个 -才怪 +
我真的有 一个是当我需要温柔拥抱时 +
一个是当我想要严厉教训时 +
还有一个是当我想欣赏 潇洒美男子时 +
-你真变态 -所以我才要看其他两个 +
-需要我推荐吗？ -米兰达帮我介绍了一个 +
艾伦葛林菲尔医生 +
葛医生？我的天，她超热门 葛妮斯派特洛也找她 +
-她为什么看心理医生？ -她饱受自视过高之苦 +
当我思量是否要接受心理治疗 米兰达舒服地坐在沙发上 +
两天后 她有了另一次深夜偶遇 +
不久，米兰达为自己找到一个 夜间的玩伴 +
一周后，我如期去看 名流心理医生…葛大夫 +
凯莉，告诉我你为什么来这里 +
我的朋友们受不了我 +
你就像非常昂贵的寄养中心 +
什么事困扰她们？ +
她们说我讲太多前男友的事 +
但分手之后那是正常现象吧？ +
-我不喜欢“正常”这个字眼 -那当然 +
这样一来你就没有病人了 +
跟我谈谈他，前男友 +
你知道… +
我得对你坦白 +
我不确定是否真相信心理治疗 +
我比较算是自力救济型的人 +
好吧 +
我不知道 +
他很聪明 +
他很性感，只是心态不正常 +
他一直在玩游戏 但我却不知道规则 +
-你们一直在玩游戏？ -不，是他在玩 +
-我只是奉陪下场 -那你呢？ +
这是你第一次跟一个 +
不能满足你需求的 男人交往吗？ +
这问得倒轻松 +
好吧… +
也许我曾跟不适合我的人交往 可是谁没有呢？ +
但他们的共同点…是你 +
-你想说什么？ -也许你挑错男人了 +
你当然挑错男人了 这种话我也会讲 +
坦白说 我想我挑错心理医生了 +
她一点也不了解我 +
-她以为我是游戏人间的高手 -这是对付男人的唯一办法 +
这种心态还真健康 感情无关游戏 +
而是成熟、真诚的沟通 +
你却跟邻居大玩躲猫猫 +
如果你知道自己在做什么 你就能完全控制局势 +
你只能在床上控制男人 +
若我们不断替男人口交 我们便能统治世界 +
至少我们还能空出双手 跟达官贵人打招呼 +
就算是交往中，你仍得玩游戏 +
大人物和我就是在玩游戏 看看我们的下场 +
也许游戏还没真正结束 也许只是中场休息 +
有那种错误想法就是你为何 该接受心理治疗的原因 +
我没有挑错男朋友 是他们找上我 +
你就像专门吸引 缺陷男人的磁铁？ +
而且还是漂亮 有花样和香味的那种 +
找到好男人的机会渺茫 +
连甩个名牌皮包 都会打到五个蹩脚货 +
好男人都到哪儿去了？ +
就是这里 失落男人谷的快乐时光 +
我没看过这么多男人 同时聚集在一个地方 +
-这是怎么回事？ -今晚是运动之夜 +
肯定是 来吧，姐妹们，比赛开打了 +
运动之夜，每个女人的梦想 +
整个房间都是 专注球赛的异性恋男子 +
等着在广告时段分心 +
这里充斥的睾丸酮 让我跃跃欲试 +
-我们没点这些 -运动之夜，女士饮料免费 +
忘了迪士尼乐园吧 这里才是世上最欢乐的地方 +
姐妹们，容我失陪… 我要上场了 +
-哪一队领先？ -尼克队 +
那是好事吗？ +
-我猜你不是尼克队球迷 -还不是 +
-我叫唐 -我叫莎曼珊 +
唐是一个成功的 墨西哥手提包进口商 +
他对两件事着迷 +
压抑外劳工资以及尼克队 +
-我可以教你几件事 -或者由我来教你 +
还剩十秒钟 快传球，你这白痴 +
得把球送到篮下 +
强森今晚火力全开 +
加油，拉瑞强森，快得分 +
得分 +
这正是莎曼珊两小时后的写照 +
我回到家后 夏绿蒂的话在我脑中萦绕不去 +
我们在童年玩的游戏 +
是成年后所玩游戏的入门吗？ +
男女交往 是否只是一盘西洋棋局？ +
策略、步法、反制 +
全都设计好让对手失去优势 直到赢得比赛为止？ +
究竟有没有诚实的男女关系？ 这是真的吗？ +
玩游戏是感情的成功之本？ +
礼拜六我和一个女生约会 我们相处得很愉快 +
我到了礼拜四才打电话给她 这样便不会显得猴急 +
礼拜六我和一个男生约会 我们相处得很愉快 +
这混蛋到了礼拜四才打给我 +
我过滤他的电话 而且直到礼拜一才回电 +
我给男友下了最后通牒 圣诞节前求婚，否则便分手 +
我的朋友说这是在耍手段 我认为这招很聪明 +
就算他不肯就范 我还是可以偷偷怀孕 +
隔天，我勉强赴葛医生 第二次约诊 +
我仍对此心存怀疑 在候诊室内读每本“纽约客” +
我到底能从中获得什么？ +
然后，在五分钟的间隔时间里 我得到了答案 +
嗨 +
嗨 +
我和葛医生的第三次约诊 +
我提早到了一些… 以赶上我的阅读进度 +
我叫赛斯 +
我是凯莉 +
我想我应该来自我介绍 +
很高兴你这么做 +
尤其是我穿了新洋装 +
那本“纽约客”是去年的 +
我这个纽约客 阅读进度有点落后了 +
你追随葛医生多久了？ +
不久，才三次 +
我今天正好过一周年纪念 +
-她送你什么？蛋糕？ -一大笔帐单 +
这听起来可能很怪 你愿意和我吃晚餐吗？ +
当然，我很乐意 +
打电话给我，好吗？ +
或许在心理医生的候诊室内 和摄影师赛斯罗宾森 +
敲定约会是不道德的 但他有特殊之处 +
请进，凯莉 +
你打扮得好隆重 +
他是个摄影师 +
-你在心理医生那里认识的？ -这一切皆是偶然 +
万一他是疯子怎么办？ +
疯子才有好药方 +
就是这样，上，马克斯 +
抱歉，为什么看这个 还有谁是马克斯？ +
马克斯坎比，尼克队前锋 他真的有所表现了 +
你什么时候开始关心篮球？ +
唐走火入魔，除非尼克队赢球 不然他不跟我上床 +
而他们和我可说是节节败退 +
真惨 +
尼克队是唯一被“操”的 +
-上，你们这群软脚虾 -你为什么还要跟他在一起？ +
因为性生活… 就我记忆所及，实在妙不可言 +
太好了…他们赢了 +
-他们赢了，我走了 -去吧…去做爱吧 +
隔天晚上 米兰达获得意外惊喜 +
她的玩伴认为不该再玩躲猫猫 +
而是玩医生看病的游戏 +
米兰达希望公平 所以她决定礼尚往来 +
整个城市的人都很幸运 +
赛斯和我的初次约会棒极了 +
-那盆栽是怎么回事？ -她总是不停变换位置 +
也许这是葛医生的心理测验 +
-没错，像“瓦多在哪里？” -而且还需要浇水 +
-它是塑胶花 -你确定吗？ +
我摸过了 +
你摸葛医生的盆栽？ +
我已经去了一年，难免会无聊 +
-然后你出现了 -你真会说话 +
不，是真的 +
我觉得我可以跟他谈任何事 +
为了心理健康并且不再玩游戏 +
我决定诚实相告 +
-我喜欢你 -我也喜欢你 +
过了几天，米兰达去采买晚餐 +
采买随即变成了捉迷藏的游戏 +
我想我该成熟点过来自我介绍 +
我是米兰达，你知道的… +
通风口对面的 +
对了，你住在 跟我调情的男人楼上 +
米兰达这才明白 她仍在和想像中的朋友玩游戏 +
就跟她五岁时一样 +
隔天她联络心理医生 预约紧急治疗 +
莎曼珊决定在唐家 观赏尼克队的决赛 +
庆祝篮球的球季进入尾声 +
恢复性生活 +
宝贝，再等一下 大都会队和白袜队就要开打了 +
现在篮球结束了 我可以专心看棒球 +
今年他们战绩烂透了 +
想到要再撑一整季的无性生活 +
已非莎曼珊能容忍 因此她弃权了 +
同时，我的进展也很精彩 +
赛斯和我 从另一次美好的约会返家 +
-你想进来吗？ -我想我已经进来了 +
你的公寓真不错 +
你有各种经典游戏 巴棋戏…还有扭扭乐 +
我是七年级的扭扭乐冠军 +
这是在下战书吗？ +
好，那就开始吧 +
-你还行吗？ -吾友，好得很… +
左脚黄色 +
我想那块是我的 +
你这种姿势很不雅 +
我可以做出20种不雅的姿势 +
我不要分心 +
很快便成了宽衣游戏 +
你想葛医生会怎么说？ +
不乖，坏透了的病人 +
我得告诉你，我不是很相信 心理治疗，我觉得是鬼扯 +
我要跟葛医生说 +
不要… +
-你发誓？ -我发誓 +
说真的 你为什么看心理医生？ +
我对女人有心理障碍 +
我跟她们上床之后 就会完全失去兴趣 +
你呢？你有什么问题？ +
我想在心理治疗中 这一刻可称之为突破 +
我总是挑错男人 +
虽然她说对了一些事 我决定从此不再去上门 +
我不想冒着 在候诊室撞见赛斯的尴尬风险 +
我的朋友们完全能了解 +
