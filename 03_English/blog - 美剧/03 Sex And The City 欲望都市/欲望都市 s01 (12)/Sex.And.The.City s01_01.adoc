Once upon a time +
an English journalist came to New York. +
Elizabeth was attractive and bright 快活而生气勃勃的;聪明的；悟性强的,有希望的；大有可能成功的, +
and *right away* 立刻,马上 she *hooked （使）钩住，挂住 up with* 与某人来往 one of the city's
typically eligible （婚姻）合适的，合意的 bachelors 单身汉. +
The question remains,  +
is this really a company we want to own? //问题是这家公司值得投资吗？ +


Tim was forty-two. +
A well-liked (a.)深受喜爱的；适销对路 and respected 受人尊敬的 investment banker 投资银行家, +
who made about two million a year. //年薪约两百万 +
They met [one evening] *in* typical New York *fashion* 以…方式,
at a gallery 展览馆；画廊 opening 开幕式. +


Like it? +
Yes, actually. I think it's quite interesting. +
What? +
I feel like I know you from somewhere. +
Oh, doubtful 拿不定主意；不确定；怀疑;未必；难说；不大可能. +
I only just moved here from London. +
London, really? +
That's my all-time (a.)空前的，创纪录的，一向的 favorite city. +
It is? +
Absolutely. +
It was love at first sight 一见钟情. +
You know... +
I think perhaps I have met you somewhere before. +

For two weeks they snuggled (v.)（使）依偎，紧贴，蜷伏, +
went to romantic restaurants 餐厅；[经]饭店... +
had wonderful sex... //有美妙的性爱  +
and shared the most intimate 亲密的；个人的，隐私的 secrets. +
One warm spring day he took her to a townhouse 连栋房屋 +
后定 he saw in Sunday's New York Times. +

How about if we start (v.) at the top /and work (v.)（逐渐地）移动（到某位置）；（逐步）变成（某状态） our way down? +
There are four bedrooms upstairs. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.work
(v.) to move or pass to a particular place or state, usually gradually（逐渐地）移动（到某位置）；（逐步）变成（某状态） +
[ V] +
• It will take a while for the drug to work out of your system.这药得需要一段时间才能排出你的体外。

[ VN] +
( figurative) +
• He worked his way to the top of his profession.他一步一步努力，终于成为行业内的翘楚。

.work our way down
"work our way down" 的意思是从上往下逐步查看或参观。台词中的人物建议从顶层开始，然后逐步向下参观这栋房子的各个楼层。所以这句话的意思是：从楼上的四个卧室开始，逐渐往下走，参观整栋房子。
====

Do you have any children? +
Not yet. +

That day, Tim popped (v.)（让人意外地）突然出现；冷不防冒出 the question. +
How'd you like to have dinner with my folks 亲属；家属；（尤指）爹妈;各位；大伙儿 Tuesday night? +
I'd love to. //我很乐意 +

On Tuesday, he called with some bad news. //他打电话 通知她一些坏消息 +
My mother's not feeling very well. +
Oh, gosh （非正式，表惊讶）天哪；上帝, I'm sorry. +
Can we *take a rain check* 遇雨改期,改天吧? +
Of course. +
Tell your mom I hope she feels better. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.take a rain check
字面意思是“拿一张雨票”。短语起源来自美国的棒球文化，如果比赛时因恶劣天气而不得不终止，官方将发给观众交换券(check)，凭借此券可以观看下一次的比赛。由此衍生出了 take a rain check，即: 改期, 改天吧.
====




When she hadn't heard from him for two weeks, she called. +
Tim, it's Elizabeth. +
That's an awfully 非常；极其 long _rain check_. +
He said he was *up to his ears* 深陷于；埋头于；忙于 and that he'd call the next day. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.BE UP TO YOUR EARS IN STH
to have a lot of sth to deal with 深陷于；埋头于；忙于 +
•We're *up to our ears* in work. 我们工作忙得不可开交。

up to your neck/ears/eyeballs in something 是英语的一个idiom， 意思是 “忙得不可开交”、“忙得四脚朝天”,”忙得焦头烂额”. +
If *you are "up to your neck/ears/eyeballs" in something*, that means that you are very busy with it or to have more of something than you can manage. 这一词语中用得多的是 neck，也可以用 ears 或 eyeballs 代之。
====

He never did call, of course. Bastard 杂种；浑蛋；恶棍. +
She told me one day over coffee... +
I don't understand. +
In England, looking at houses together, would have meant something.

[.my2]
在英国两个人一起看房子 是有意味的(就表示他们要结婚了) +

Then I realized, no one had told her about _the end of love_ in Manhattan. +
Welcome to the age of un-innocence. 非纯真年代 +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.innocence
n.清白，无罪；天真无邪

在英国，“一起看房子”通常被视为一件很严肃的事情，意味着关系达到了一个稳定或长期的阶段，可能是在考虑共同生活甚至结婚的前奏。看房子一起决定要住在哪里，是一种承诺的象征。  +

而在这段台词中，美国纽约的背景下，提到“the end of love in Manhattan”（曼哈顿爱情的终结）以及“the age of un-innocence”（非天真的时代），暗示了在曼哈顿这样的地方，恋爱关系可能更加自由、松散和缺乏承诺。这里“看房子”不再具有英国文化中那种深刻的象征意义，可能只是关系中的一个普通活动，而不代表任何长期承诺。
====

No one has "breakfast at Tiffany's" +
and no one has "affairs to remember." +
Instead, we have breakfast at 7:00 a.m. +
and affairs we try to forget *as quickly as possible*. +
Self-protection and _closing the deal_ are paramount (a.)至为重要的，首要的.

[.my2]
自我保护,跟完成交易, 是最高原则 +

Cupid has flown the co-op. +

[.my2]
====
“Cupid has flown the co-op” 是一种比喻的表达方式，其中“Cupid”指的是希腊神话中的爱神丘比特，通常象征爱情和浪漫。 “co-op” 是“cooperative”的缩写，通常指"合作公寓"或"联合住宅"，但在这里它更多地象征了一个团体、社群或某种环境。

整句的意思是：“爱神丘比特已经飞离了这个地方。” 换句话说，这里指的是浪漫和爱情已经离开了，或者说在当前的环境中，浪漫已经不再存在。结合上下文，这句话表达的是在现代社会，特别是在像曼哈顿这样快节奏的环境中，浪漫已经不再重要，人们更加注重实际的事务和自我保护，而不是追求爱情和浪漫。
====

How the hell did we get into this mess （组织欠佳等导致的）麻烦，困境，混乱? +
There are thousands, +
maybe _tens of thousands of_ 数以万计的 women like this in the city. +
We all know them /and we all agree they're great. +
They travel, they pay (v.) taxes, +
they'll spend $400 on a pair of _Manolo Blahnik_ _strappy (a.)（鞋或衣服）有带子的 sandals_ 凉鞋；拖鞋；便鞋, +
and they're alone. +

[.my1]

It's like _the riddle 谜；谜语 of the Sphinx_ 狮身人面像. +
Why are there so many great 数量大的；众多的 unmarried women +
and no great unmarried men? +
I explore these sorts of issues in my column （报刊的）专栏，栏目 +
and I have terrific sources 很棒的来源, my friends. +

When you're _a young guy_ in your twenties, +
women are controlling the relationships. +
By the time you're _an eligible （婚姻）合适的，合意的 man_ in your thirties, +
you feel like you're being devoured (v.)（尤指因饥饿而）狼吞虎咽地吃光 by women. +
Suddenly the guys are holding all the chips （作赌注用的）筹码. +
I call it "the mid-thirties _power flip_ （使）快速翻转，迅速翻动." +
It's all about age and biology 生理. +
I mean, if you want to get married, +
it's to have kids, right?  //结婚就得生孩子 +
And you don't want to do it with someone older than 35 +
'cause 因为 then you have to have kids right away +
and that's about it. +

[.my2]
而且你不想跟一个35岁以上的人结婚，因为那样你得马上生孩子，就是这么一回事。

I think these women should forget about marriage... +
and have a good time. +



I have a friend +
who'd always gone out with extremely sexy 性感的，引起性欲的 guys +
and just had a good time. +
One day she woke up and she was forty-one. +
She couldn't get any more dates 约会. +
She had a complete physical breakdown 身体崩溃,体力衰竭 , +
couldn't *hold on to* 抓紧；不放开 her job, //连工作都保不住 +
and had to move back to Wisconsin +
to live with her mother. +


Trust me, +
this is not a story that makes men feel bad. +
Most men are threatened by successful women. +
If you want to get these guys, +
you have to _keep your mouth shut_ and _play by the rules_. +
I totally believe that _love conquers (v.)征服 all_. +

[.my2]
如果你想抓住这些男人, 就得闭嘴﹐乖乖地照规矩来

Sometimes you just have to give it a little space +
and that's exactly what's missing in Manhattan, +
the space for romance. +

[.my2]
曼哈顿所缺少的, 就是浪漫的情感空间

The problem is expectations 期望；预期；期望值, +
older women don't want *to settle for* 勉强接受；将就 what's available. +

[.my2]
问题出在期待, 老女人不接受垂手可得的东西

By the time you reach your mid-thirties, +
you think, why should I settle? +
You know? +
It's like /the older we get the more /we *keep* self-selecting 自我选择 *down to* a smaller and smaller group. +

[.my2]
就好像我们年纪越大，我们的自我选择范围(群体对象)就越小。

What women really want is Alec Baldwin. +
There's not one woman in New York +
who hasn't *turned down* 拒绝，顶回（提议、建议或提议人） ten wonderful guys +
because they were too short, or too fat, or too poor. +

[.my2]
在纽约每个女人 至少都拒绝过十个好男人,
只因为他们太矮﹑太胖或太穷

I have been out with some of those guys, +
the short, fat, poor ones. +
It makes absolutely no difference. +
They are just *as* self-centered 自我中心的；利己主义的 and unappreciative 不欣赏的;不赏识的 *as* the good-looking ones. +

[.my2]
我跟又矮又胖的穷男人约会过 他们都一样 +
他们跟帅哥一样自私

Why don't these women just marry a fat guy? +
Why don't they just marry
a big fat tub 盆；桶 of lard （烹调用的）猪油? +

( Happy birthday Dear Miranda ) +
 (Happy birthday to you)  +
Another thirty-something birthday 三十来岁的生日
with a group of unmarried female friends. +
We would all have preferred (v.)更喜爱，宁可 a nice celebratory (a.)庆祝的；庆贺的；快乐的 conference call. +

You were saying? +
Look... Look, if you're a successful saleswoman in this city, +
you have two choices. +
You can bang 猛敲；砸 your head against the wall +
and try and find a relationship, or you can say "screw it 管他呢," +
and just go out and have sex like a man. +
You mean with dildos 假阴茎? +
No. I mean without feeling. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
"bang your head against the wall" 是一种比喻表达，意思是“徒劳无功地努力”或者“做一些很困难、让自己挫败的事情”。在这里，它指的是在城市里试图找到一段稳定的关系，但这个过程让人感到非常困难和沮丧。

"screw it" 是一种口语表达，相当于中文中的“算了吧”或者“去他的”。它表达了放弃或不再在意某件事的态度。这里的意思是放弃寻找关系，转而选择更随意的生活方式。

"I mean without feeling" 的意思是“我的意思是没有感情”。在这个上下文中，这句话是在解释前面的说法，意思是像男人一样去发生性关系，但不带有任何情感投入或依恋，强调的是一种情感上的疏离和不在乎。

Samantha Jones was a New York inspiration 启发灵感的人（或事物）；使人产生动机的人（或事物）;灵感. +

It was like, "Hey, babe, gotta go 得走了, catch you later 稍后再见." +
And I completely forgot about him after that. +
But are you sure that /that isn't just 'cause he didn't call you? +

Sweetheart, this is the first time in the history of Manhattan +
that women have had *as much* money and power *as* men, +
plus _the equal 同等的 luxury_ 不常有的乐趣（或享受、优势） of _treating (v.) men like sex objects_ 性对象; 发泄性欲的对象. +

[.my2]
甜心﹐这是曼哈顿史上第一次 +
女人的权力跟男人一样大 +
她们也有同等地享受, 能把男人当性玩物

Yeah, except 除了，只是 men in this city `谓` fail (v.) on both counts 数目; 数量. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
"except men in this city fail on both counts" 的意思是“只是，这个城市的男人在这两个方面都不及格。” +
"both counts" 是指两个方面：(1) 男人不想和女人建立关系；(2) 男人在女人只想要性关系时, 表现得不如预期。
====

Oh, come on, ladies, are we really that cynical 认为人皆自私的；愤世嫉俗的;悲观的；怀疑的? +
What about romance? +

but then he wanted to read me his poetry +
and go out to dinner 正餐，晚餐 and the whole chat bit 小部分，片段, +
and I'm like, let's not even go there. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.the whole chat bit
"the whole chat bit" 指的是“全部的谈话环节”或者“聊天的部分”。这里的“bit”是一种非正式的表达方式，指的是某个特定的部分或环节。“the whole chat bit”指的是那种伴随着浪漫关系的聊天、交谈和社交互动。

.let's not even go there
"let's not even go there" 是一种表达，意思是“我们根本不要去碰那个话题”或者“我们最好不要涉及那个”。

综上所述，这句话的意思是：“他想要给我读诗，和我一起去吃晚餐，还有所有那些谈话的环节，而我当时的想法是，别跟我谈这些。” 表达出对浪漫和深入交流的排斥，更倾向于保持关系在纯粹的性层面。

.I'm like...
"I'm like" 是一种非正式的口语表达，用来引述或模仿自己当时的想法或反应。它类似于 “I said” 或 “I thought”，但更随意，更常用于年轻人或非正式的对话中。 +

====


What are you saying? Are you saying you're just gonna
*give up on* 对…不再抱希望（或不再相信） love? +
-That's sick （身体或精神）生病的，有病的;变态的；病态的! Oh, no. No, no. +
Believe me, the right guy *comes along* 出现 +
and you two right here, this whole thing, shew, right out the window.  +
-That's right! +
[.my1]
.案例
====
这里的 "shew" 是 "shoo" 的一种非正式拼写形式，模仿挥手赶走什么东西时发出的声音。它通常用来表达某物或某事迅速消失或被轻易抛开。 +

在这段对话中，"shew, right out the window" 的意思是“（这些想法）一下子就会被抛到窗外”，意思是当那个“合适的人”出现时，当前的这些关于放弃爱情的想法将迅速消失。
====


Listen, the right guy is an illusion. +
You understand that, you can start living your life. +
So you think it's really possible +
*to pull off* 做成，完成（困难的事情） this whole, um... +
women having sex like men thing? +

You're forgetting _The Last Seduction_ 诱奸;诱惑力；魅力；吸引力. +
You're obsessed (a.)（对……）着迷的，（受……）困扰的 with that movie. +

[.my2]
听着，“那个合适的人”只是个幻想。 明白了这一点，你就可以开始真正地生活了。 所以你认为真的可以实现这种，嗯…… 女人像男人一样对待性爱的情况？ 你忘了《最后的诱惑》了吗？ 你对那部电影太着迷了。

That's funny, Skippy. +
Skipper. +
I have this theory that men secretly hate pretty girls +
because they feel that /they're the ones who rejected 拒绝，驳回 them in high school. +
Right, but if you're not part of the beauty Olympics 选美奥运会, +
you can still become a very, you know... interesting person. +
Are you saying that I'm not pretty enough? +
No, no, no, of course you are. +

Women either *fall into* one of two categories 类别，范畴, +
beautiful and boring, or homely (a.)相貌平平的;简单且好的；家常的 and interesting? +

Alright, let's keep 'em where I can see 'em, alright? +

You see that guy? +
He's the next Donald Trump, +

Hi. +
Do you know him? +
No, I've never seen him in my life. +
He usually dates (v.)约会 models, but hey, +
I'm as good-looking as a model, +

Want to go back to my place and see the Ross Bleckner? +

but, uh, I really need to have sex 做爱 tonight. +

[.my1]

walk (v.) home... +

Well, aren't you? +
Not a drop. //一滴都没, 完全不是 +
Not even half a drop. //连半滴都没有。 +

[.my1]
.案例
====
“drop” 是指情感或感觉的一点点。台词的意思是，有些人发生性关系后会感到空虚或没有任何情感，但对方不是这样，甚至连一点点（drop）情感都没有缺失。这个表达方式强调了对方在情感上的充实和完整。

Wow, what's wrong with you? +
I get it.  我懂了 +

[.my1]
.案例
====
在美剧中，可能会听到把 abso- 和 -lutely 拆开，中间加上 freakin 或者 f 开头的“那个词”，Jenny 提到在《欲望都市》里就有经常用到。好朋友开玩笑当然没问题，但正式场合还是要避免使用哦。直接用上 absolutely ，你的英语听起来很地道啦!
