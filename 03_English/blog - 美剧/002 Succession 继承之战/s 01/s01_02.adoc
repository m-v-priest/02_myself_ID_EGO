====
.As in?
这里的 *“As in?”* 是一个口语中非常常见的表达，**用于请求对方澄清或具体说明。**它完整的意味是 “你指的是哪个（弗兰克）？” 或者 “你具体在说什么（关于弗兰克的事）？” +

它可以理解为以下几种说法的简略形式： +
​​As in what?​​ （具体指什么？） +
​​As in who?​​ （具体指谁？） +
​​You mean…?​​ （你的意思是…？） +
​​Could you be more specific?​​ （你能说得更具体点吗？） +

*“As in?” 在这里是一个​​口语中用于要求对方澄清​​的惯用语。
当对方提到一个名字、一个概念或一个情况，但语境不够明确时，听者会用 “As in?” 来反问，意思是“你具体指的是什么？”或“你能详细说明一下吗？”*

在这个场景里，第一个说话人只说了“弗兰克的问题”，信息不完整。第二个人的“As in?” 就是在追问：“你指的是关于弗兰克的哪个问题？” +
对方接下来的回答 “Logan fired him...” 才具体说明了是“被解雇”的这个问题。

What the fuck is this, McCarthyism 麦卡锡主义?

.案例
====
McCarthyism 指20世纪50年代美国参议员约瑟夫·麦卡锡煽起的反共迫害浪潮，其特征是公开调查、不公正指控、胁迫人们表态或检举他人。说话人用这个词，是抗议对方用“为记录在案”这种正式、带有审讯和定性意味的方式提问，感觉像是在被迫表明政治立场一样，非常反感和抵触。

I'm not declining, I'm just not...
[.my2]
我不是拒绝，我只是不…


I'm not "Clining." What the f...
[.my2]
我不是“拒决”。这他妈的…


[.my1]
.案例
====
.Clining
这里的 ​​"Clining"​​ 不是一个标准英语单词。它是一个说话人临时生造的、基于前面单词 ​​"declining"​​ 的文字游戏。

​​结构分析​​： +
单词 "declining" 可以拆解为 "de-" + "clining"。 +
"de-" 是一个常见的前缀，表示“否定”、“相反”或“移除”。 +

*说话人生造了 "Clining" 这个词，来表示 "declining" 这个动作的“相反面”或“积极面”。* +

​​语境意图​​： +
*说话人说“我不是在拒绝”，但他也不想做出明确的、积极的“接受”。他处于一种犹豫、观望、不置可否的状态。他需要创造一个词来形容这种“既不拒绝，也不接受”的中间状态。* +

​​"Clining" 的意味​​：*既然 "declining" 是“拒绝”，那么去掉表示否定的前缀 "de-"，剩下的 "Clining" 就被临时赋予了一种模糊的“倾向於接受”、“准备接受”或“正在靠近接受”的意味。* +

所以，整句话的意思是： +
“我不是在拒绝，我只是没有… *我没有在‘准备接受’。” 或者说 “…我没有处于那种‘积极倾向’的状态。”* +
这是一种非常巧妙、口语化的方式，来表达一种极其暧昧、犹豫不决的立场。 +

**我不是在拒绝，我只是没有… 我没有在“准备答应”。**这他妈… +

So, what, do you operate 做手术?
[.my2]
所以，怎么办，你们做手术吗？


We don't do that with deep bleeds (n.), especially in older patients 年长病人.
[.my2]
对于深层出血，尤其是老年患者，我们不这样做。


[.my1]
.案例
====
.We don't do that with deep bleeds. 这句中的 bleeds 为什么用复数?
​​“bleeds”​​ 在这里使用复数，是因为它在医学语境下作为一个​​名词​​使用，意思是 ​​“出血事件”​​ 或 ​​“出血灶”​​。

词性转换​​：单词 “bleed” 最常用作动词（流血）。但在这里，它动名词化（或直接转化为名词），表示“一次出血”这个事件或实例。这与 “heart attack”（心脏病发作）的逻辑类似，“attack” 从动词转变为指代一次疾病事件。 +

*#​​为什么用复数​​：当指代身体内发生的​​多次、多处或多种类型的出血​​时，就会使用复数形式 “bleeds”。#* +

​​“deep bleeds”​​ 特指发生在身体内部深层组织（如大脑、内脏等）的出血，与体表划伤这种“表层出血”相对。 +
*在临床诊断中，医生通过扫描（如CT或MRI）可能会在病人体内发现​​不止一个​​出血点。因此，“deep bleeds” 准确地描述了​​存在多个深层出血事件/病灶​​的临床情况。* +

*#即使用于泛指一类情况（“我们不对深层出血患者这样做”），使用复数形式 “bleeds” 也是医学上的常规用法，用来指代“深层出血”这类病症的​​所有情况或实例​​，类似于 “infections”（感染）、“fractures”（骨折）的用法。#* +

总结:
所以，​​“bleeds”​​ 用复数不是因为“流血”这个动作本身，而是因为它作为​​医学名词​​，指代了​​多次或多种出血事件​​。 +

"attendant lord" 和 "swell a scene or two" 是文学化、略带自嘲的表达。
"attendant lord" 源自诗歌，指地位较高但非主角的贵族随从，意指自己只是个配角。
"swell a scene or two" 字面是“撑大/充实一两个场景”，比喻自己只是用来增加场面分量、凑数的人。
说话人用此表示自己无意也无力承担董事长重任，只想做个无足轻重的配角。

What the fuck does that mean?
[.my2]
这他妈是什么意思？

Come on, don't do that 别这样.
[.my2]

he was loco in the coco 疯了, I don't know what is.
[.my2]
表明他疯了，那我就不知道什么才是了。


[.my1]
.案例

"loco in the coco" 是一个押韵的俚语表达，意思是“疯了”、“精神错乱”。"loco" 是西班牙语，意为“疯狂的”，"coco" 在俚语中可指“脑袋”。这种说法带有戏谑、夸张的色彩。

Well, I don't see it that way.

It's called a lie 谎言, Shiv.
[.my2]

Your pecker's in my pocket 命脉在我手里, OK,
[.my2]
你的命脉在我手里，懂吗，


Dickless Dickleby?
[.my2]
没种的迪克尔比？


[.my1]
.案例

"Your pecker's in my pocket" 是极具侮辱性的俚语。"pecker" 字面指阴茎，这里比喻命脉、把柄或要害。"in my pocket" 意为“在我掌控之中”。整个短语意为“你的要害攥在我手里”。
"Dickless Dickleby" 是人身攻击。"Dickless" 意为“没有阳具的”，指懦弱。"Dickleby" 是对方姓氏的篡改，以押韵加强侮辱效果。说话人极尽羞辱，强调绝对控制权。

You do what I say.
[.my2]
照我说的做。


Let others say what they want, but we stay dark 保持沉默.
[.my2]
让别人爱说什么说什么，但我们保持沉默。

[.my2]
一文不值。懂了吗？


I'd jerk off 手淫 on that paper and send it to you as a greeting card 贺卡.
[.my2]
我宁愿在那张纸上手淫然后把它当贺卡寄给你。


[.my1]
.案例

“jerk off” 是极其粗俗的俚语，表示手淫。这里用作夸张的比喻，表达对“那张纸”（可能指重要文件或协议）的极度蔑视和不屑。
“greeting card” 是贺卡，用在这里形成一种荒谬的对比，进一步强调说话人的侮辱和轻蔑态度。

Simon says, Mum's the word 保守秘密；别声张.
[.my2]

[.my1]

混蛋。

[.my2]
嘿，我们得商量一下怎么应对罗伊家的这摊烂事。


[.my1]
.案例

“put something together” 在这里不是“把东西放在一起”，而是“组织/安排一下（应对方案）”。
“shitshow” 是非常粗俗的俚语，意思是“一团糟的局面”、“烂摊子”。

So, and I don't want to get into this 深入讨论, 卷入, but maybe we should just cut off 停止，中断 the whole Kendall CEO thing so that it doesn't get painful 令人痛苦的.
[.my2]
所以，我不想深入谈这个，但也许我们该直接断了让肯德尔当CEO的念头，免得以后难堪。

[.my2]
但爸爸不信任任何人，除了弗兰克，而他为了找乐子把弗兰克开了。


[.my1]
.案例

“for shits and giggles” 是粗俗的俚语，意思是“为了好玩”、“闹着玩”、“一时兴起”，指做某事没有严肃的理由，只是为了取乐。

Gerri?
[.my2]
格里？


I don't love Gerri.
[.my2]
我不算喜欢格里。


But I don't hate Gerri.
[.my2]
但也不讨厌她。


So, Gerri.
[.my2]
所以，就格里吧。


I'll talk to her.
[.my2]
我去跟她谈。


So, Gerri.
[.my2]
那么，格里。

[.my2]
我知道。我知道。我记得…你…


So, uh, Gerri, uh, just wanted to say thanks for captaining 率领，指挥 us through this shitstorm 困难局面，烂摊子.
[.my2]
所以，呃，格里，呃，只是想谢谢你带领我们度过这场风波。


[.my1]
.案例

“captaining” 动词，意思是“担任队长”、“率领”，这里形象地表示“带领、指挥（团队度过难关）”。
“shitstorm” 是粗俗俚语，比喻“极其糟糕、混乱的局面”，比“shitshow”程度更甚，常指危机。

Um, you do a good job, Gerri, you, uh, you're, um, you're a real good job-doer.
[.my2]
嗯，你干得很好，格里，你，呃，你，嗯，你真是个干活的好手。


[.my1]
.案例

“job-doer” 不是一个标准词汇，是说话人临时生造的，听起来笨拙且不专业，反映了说话人（罗马）在尝试进行“企业式奉承”时的尴尬和不擅长。

I suck at 不擅长 the whole corporate flirt 调情 thing.
[.my2]
我实在不擅长这套职场调情。


[.my1]
.案例

“corporate flirt” 这里不是字面意义的调情，而是指职场中为了讨好、达成目的而说的那些委婉、奉承的话，类似于“打官腔”、“说客套话”。

You know, I just... I like to lube up 涂润滑油 and fuck 性交, you know?
[.my2]
你知道，我就是…我喜欢涂好润滑油直接干，懂吗？


[.my1]
.案例

“lube up and fuck” 是极其粗俗和直白的比喻，意思是“不要前戏，直接进入正题”，表达了说话人喜欢直接了当、讨厌拐弯抹角的处事风格。这与前面的“corporate flirt”形成鲜明对比。

-ok. -ok.

[.my2]
-行。 -行。


So, um... for me and Shiv, the whole Kendall thing doesn't work 行不通.
[.my2]
所以，嗯…对我和希芙来说，肯德尔那套行不通。


So we were thinkin'... general counsel 首席法律顾问... you know where the bodies are buried 知道秘密/内幕.
[.my2]
所以我们想…首席法律顾问…你清楚所有的内幕。


[.my1]
.案例

“general counsel” 指公司的首席法律顾问。
“know where the bodies are buried” 是一个习语，字面是“知道尸体埋在哪里”，比喻“知道（组织或某人的）秘密、丑闻或真相”。

You probably buried 'em yourself.
[.my2]
可能有些就是你亲手埋的。


So... you would have the family's support to step in 介入，接手 and take the reins 掌管，接手.
[.my2]
所以…家族会支持你介入并接管。


[.my1]
.案例

“step in” 意思是“介入”、“插手”、“接手”。
“take the reins” 字面是“抓住缰绳”，比喻“接管”、“掌管”、“控制局面”。

That's a very generous offer 慷慨的提议, but I'm going to have to decline 拒绝.
[.my2]

好吧。呃，我能问问为什么吗？


Why I don't want the job that makes your brain explode 使你的大脑爆炸?
[.my2]
为什么我不想要那个会让你脑袋爆炸的职位？


OK, but, um, uh... G-Gerri, excuse me 打扰一下, but I... I've always thought of you... and I mean this in the best possible way 我这么说完全是好意... as a stone-cold killer bitch 冷酷无情的厉害角色.
[.my2]
好吧，但是，嗯，呃…格-格里，恕我直言，我…我一直认为你…我这么说完全是好意…是个冷酷无情的厉害角色。


[.my1]
.案例

“excuse me” 这里不是道歉，而是用于提出不同意见或进行批评前的客气话，类似于“恕我直言”。
“in the best possible way” 是说话人试图缓和后续评价可能带来的冒犯，强调自己是出于“好意”或“赞赏”。
“stone-cold killer” 原指冷酷的杀手，在商业语境中比喻“ ruthless、为达目的不择手段的厉害角色”。“bitch”是贬义词，但在这里的语境下，结合“stone-cold killer”，可能是一种扭曲的、带有一定“赞赏”意味的形容，指其强硬、果断、不留情面。

Who says you don't know how to flirt 调情?
[.my2]
谁说你不会调情了？


Ok.
[.my2]
好吧。


Hey. Can I get a moment alone 单独待一会儿 with you, do you think?

我们不能像政治局或者《周末夜先生》那样，把他架起来挥挥手就说他没事。


[.my1]

[.my2]
你实际上真的非常需要。


I think you do.
[.my2]
我认为你需要。


Without it, after what Dad did to you, I mean, we could probably take any appointment 任命 to court 法庭.
[.my2]
没有支持，在爸爸对你做了那些之后，我的意思是，我们很可能能把任何任命告上法庭。


Jesus, Shiv, we're talking about court 法庭 now?
[.my2]
天啊，希芙，我们现在都要谈到上法庭了？


Fuck you!
[.my2]
去你的！


I didn't even want to talk about this, remember?
[.my2]
我甚至都不想谈这个，记得吗？

我可是联合国白头盔。行了吧？


[.my1]
.案例

“UN white helmet” 指联合国工作人员（可能指维和人员或观察员）所戴的白色头盔，是身份象征。这里说话人（罗马）可能是在用一种荒谬的方式自抬身价，暗示自己具有国际视野或中立性，但更可能是一种讽刺或玩笑。

Guys--who else are you gonna get?
[.my2]
各位——你们还能找谁？


I think Shiv would be great.

“fantasy world” 指不切实际的“幻想世界”。
“unicorn” 在商业语境中常指“稀有、成功得不可思议的初创公司”，但这里回归神话本意，指“神奇的独角兽”，比喻完全不存在的、完美的领导者形象。整个句子充满了讽刺和愤怒。

Fuck your options.

去你妈的选择。

对不起。


Ken, I... What can I say? It's... I don't know. Adrenaline 肾上腺素.
[.my2]
肯，我…我能说什么呢？这…我不知道。是肾上腺素在作用。


[.my1]
.案例

“Adrenaline” 是肾上腺素，人在压力、紧张、兴奋时会分泌，导致心跳加速等生理反应。这里说话人（可能是劳伦斯）可能指肯德尔现在的状态是肾上腺素驱动的，不一定是真实感受或可持续的。

It's just my body.
[.my2]
只是身体的反应。


I'm glad you're here.
[.my2]
很高兴你在这儿。


Yeah. I can tell 我看得出来.
[.my2]
是啊。我看得出来。


-Hey. Look. Stop. Stop. -No. I'm not in the mood 没心情.

[.my2]
-嘿。听着。停下。停下。 -不。我现在没心情。


There's something I have to say to you.

[.my1]
.案例

“sterile environment” 指医院等“无菌环境”。

我和我的好哥们罗米。


I thought I was a fuckhead 蠢货.
[.my2]
我以为我是个蠢货呢。


Uh, dipshit 笨蛋, and you said that.
[.my2]
呃，笨蛋，这可是你说的。


You said I wasn't serious 不认真.
[.my2]
你说我不靠谱。


Sorry. It's been a long day.
[.my2]
抱歉。今天太漫长了。


Yeah.
[.my2]
是啊。


But dude 老兄, seriously 说真的.
[.my2]
但是老兄，说真的。


Me and you, bro 兄弟.
[.my2]
你和我，兄弟。


Like, I could teach you.
[.my2]
比如，我可以教你。


And you could, you know, teach me.
[.my2]
而你也能，你知道，教我。


And Shiv?
[.my2]
那希芙呢？


I mean, you know what Shiv's like.
[.my2]
我是说，你知道希芙是什么样的人。


Ultimately she's a daddy's girl 爸爸的乖女儿. Right?
[.my2]
说到底她是个爸爸的乖女儿。对吧？


I mean, she wants to play it safe 求稳.
[.my2]
我的意思是，她想要求稳。


We're the ones with the nuts 胆量 to fuckin' revolutionize 革新.
[.my2]
我们才是他妈的有胆量搞革新的人。


[.my1]
.案例

“with the nuts” 是粗俗口语，“nuts” 这里指“睾丸”，引申为“勇气”、“胆量”。
“revolutionize” 意思是“彻底改革”、“革新”。

OK, I'm not uninterested 不是不感兴趣.
[.my2]
好吧，我不是不感兴趣。


All right, then, let's fuckin' do it.
[.my2]
那好，那我们他妈的就干吧。


Here's the thing 事情是这样的. Gerri just turned down 拒绝了 the top job 最高职位.
[.my2]
事情是这样的。格里刚刚拒绝了最高职位。


So does that mean something?
[.my2]
那这有什么意味吗？


Are you fuckin' with me 耍我?
[.my2]
你他妈在耍我吗？


Nope.
[.my2]
没有。


Who asked Gerri?
[.my2]
谁找的格里？


It was broached 被提出.
[.my2]
有人提过。


-It was broached? -Yeah.

[.my2]
-有人提过？ -是的。


By who? Did you broach? You broached it, didn't you?
[.my2]
被谁？你提的吗？是你提的，对不对？


Don't pin the broach 把胸针（此处为谐音双关） on me, OK? Everyone was broaching.
[.my2]
别想把这事儿推到我头上，行吗？当时每个人都在提。


[.my1]
.案例

“Don't pin the broach on me” 是一个文字游戏。“broach” (提出) 和 “brooch” (胸针) 发音相似，但“pin the brooch on me” 是固定说法，意思是“把胸针别在我身上”，引申为“把某事归咎于我”。这里说话人（罗马）故意混淆两者，制造了一种滑稽效果。
“broaching” 指“提出（议题）”。

Just want to make sure we trust each other.
[.my2]
只是想确保我们彼此信任。


Everything up front 开诚布公, OK?
[.my2]
一切都开诚布公，好吗？

Sometimes a peacekeeper 维和人员 has to go shoot a maniac 疯子 on the perimeter 外围, OK?
[.my2]
有时候维和人员也得去外围击毙个疯子，懂吗？


What the fuck? Why would you say no to this and yes to Gerri?
[.my2]
搞什么？为什么你反对这个却同意格里？


Gerri has been with the company for 20 years. Dad trusts her.
[.my2]
格里在公司20年了。爸爸信任她。


She's older. She's wiser. She's a mature 成熟的人 person... such as myself.

-临时的。 -好吧，比如谁？


I don't know, someone neutral 中立的.
[.my2]
我不知道，找个中立的人。


Eva or... American Psycho 美国精神病人, what... -Karl. -Karl. Yeah.
[.my2]
伊娃或者…《美国精神病人》，叫什么… -卡尔。 -卡尔。对。


And what if it isn't temporary, what if he uses his position to make it permanent 永久的?
[.my2]
那如果不是临时的呢，万一他利用职位转正了呢？


Because he wouldn't do that. He's nice! He brought coffee.
[.my2]
因为他不会那么做的。他人很好！他还带了咖啡。


Oh, he brought coffee.
[.my2]
哦，他带了咖啡。


Then we should definitely let him take control of 控制 the company.
[.my2]
那我们绝对应该让他接管公司。


Dude, he's not gonna take control of the company.
[.my2]
老兄，他不会接管公司的。


Look, it's a gamble 赌博.
[.my2]
听着，这是一场赌博。


It's either me and Roman and us as a family, or it's Eva and Karl, or some fuckface suit 讨厌的西装革履者 from the Deep State 深层集团 of the company.
[.my2]
要么是我和罗曼，我们作为一家人来管，要么就是伊娃和卡尔，或者公司深层集团里某个讨厌的西装革履的家伙。


[.my1]
.案例

“fuckface suit” 是粗俗语，“fuckface” 是骂人话，“suit” 指穿西装的公司高管，合起来指“讨厌的高管”。
“Deep State” 原指政府中非经民选、却有巨大影响力的秘密集团，这里借指公司内部盘根错节的实权派。

They could take the company out of our hands, and we'd never get near it again.
[.my2]
他们可能把公司从我们手中夺走，我们就再也碰不到了。


If Dad wakes up, and he's frail 虚弱的, and he's looking at the end game 终局, you want to be the one who tells him his family business isn't family-run 家族经营 anymore?
[.my2]
如果爸爸醒过来，身体虚弱，面临终局，你想当那个告诉他家族企业不再由家族经营的人吗？


I mean, maybe you could get away with it 侥幸成功... -you know, his favorite 最爱. -Oh, fuck you.
[.my2]
我是说，也许你能侥幸成功… -你知道，你是他的最爱。 -哦，去你的。


But maybe you wouldn't stay his favorite if you gave away 让出 the firm.
[.my2]
但如果你让出了公司，也许你就不会一直是他最爱了。


Look, we need a statement 声明 by 6:30.
[.my2]
听着，我们6点半前需要发个声明。


So you just have to think... like, bullshit 废话 aside... who do you think, really, Dad would prefer 更偏爱?
[.my2]
所以你们只需要想想…撇开那些废话…你们觉得，说真的，爸爸会更偏爱谁？


What's up 怎么了, fam 家人?
[.my2]
怎么了，家人们？


Oh. Yeah... did you get the papers 文件?
[.my2]
哦。是的…你拿到文件了吗？


-What? -The pap... The papers in the envelope 信封? I called you?

[.my2]
-什么？ -文…信封里的文件？我给你打过电话？


Dude... Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
[.my2]
老兄…哦，天啊。我非常抱歉。


So no, basically?
[.my2]
所以基本上就是，没拿到？


I was thinking about your dad, -I was up there... -Hey, don't worry about it 别担心.
[.my2]
我当时在想你爸爸，-我在上面… -嘿，别担心了。


My head was just messed up 乱糟糟的.
[.my2]
我的脑子当时乱糟糟的。


OK. We're gonna have to announce 宣布. Where are we at 我们进行到哪了?
[.my2]
好吧。我们得宣布了。我们进行到哪一步了？


While Dad is ill, the family proposes 提议 that Kendall run the company with Roman as COO.
[.my2]
在父亲患病期间，家族提议由肯德尔管理公司，罗曼担任COO。


I hereby concur 正式同意.
[.my2]
我正式同意。


OK. OK...
[.my2]
好的。好的…


I will let the committee know the family's position 立场, and pending 在…之前 board approval 董事会批准, we can announce.
[.my2]
我会告知委员会家族的立场，待董事会批准后，我们就可以宣布了。


-Congratulations, Kendall. -Thanks, Gerri.

[.my2]
-恭喜，肯德尔。 -谢谢，格里。


And Roman, congratulations.
[.my2]
还有罗曼，恭喜。


This is all very exciting.
[.my2]
这一切真令人兴奋。


Difficult decision.
[.my2]
艰难的决定。


For the record 郑重声明, I personally believe this to be a total fucking disaster 灾难.
[.my2]
郑重声明，我个人认为这完全是他妈的一场灾难。


OK, good.
[.my2]
好吧，很好。


Kendall, um, listen, we need to talk.
[.my2]
肯德尔，嗯，听着，我们需要谈谈。


I'm sorry, I just need to... I just need a conversation with you in private 私下.
[.my2]
抱歉，我只是需要…我需要和你私下谈一谈。


What is this?
[.my2]
什么事？


There's a few things you should know.
[.my2]
有几件事你应该知道。


OK, there's no way to put this nicely 委婉地说, so forgive me for stating it baldly 直截了当地说, but, there's a huge debt 债务 problem.
[.my2]
好吧，这事没法委婉地说，所以请原谅我直说了，但是，存在巨大的债务问题。


What are you... No.
[.my2]
你说什么…不。


-Yes. Three billion. -No, there's not.

[.my2]
-是的。三十亿。 -不，没有。


Fuck off. I'd know.
[.my2]
滚蛋。我会知道的。


No one knows.
[.my2]
没人知道。


Well, me and Frank.
[.my2]
嗯，我和弗兰克知道。


What about... Dad?
[.my2]
那…爸爸呢？


Yeah, your dad.
[.my2]
是的，你爸爸。


Hence 因此 the debt.
[.my2]
所以才有了这笔债。


Gerri, what the fuck is going on?
[.my2]
格里，他妈到底怎么回事？


Where did the money go?
[.my2]
钱去哪了？


In 1985, Logan needed cash badly 急需 for the expansion 扩张 into parks, so he took out a loan 贷款 through the family holding company 控股公司.
[.my2]
1985年，洛根急需现金扩张公园业务，所以他通过家族控股公司贷了一笔款。


He knew that besides Frank, none of the other boards members could see what was happening.
[.my2]
他知道除了弗兰克，其他董事会成员都看不出来。


And then he added that loan to the company's already considerable 相当可观的 debt.
[.my2]
然后他把那笔贷款加到了公司本已相当可观的债务上。


Son of a bitch 狗娘养的.
[.my2]
狗娘养的。


Ok.
[.my2]
好吧。


Ok.
[.my2]
好吧。


We can deal 应对.
[.my2]
我们能应付。


Yeah, but Kendall, the thing is, it's secured against 以…作担保 Waystar's stock 股票... and when the stock hits 达到 130, they can pursue repayment in full 要求全额还款.
[.my2]
是的，但是肯德尔，问题是，这笔贷款是以Waystar的股票作担保的…当股价跌到130时，他们可以要求全额还款。


Which, if they decided to do that, would eviscerate 摧毁 us.
[.my2]
而如果他们决定这么做，会彻底摧毁我们。


Yeah, but there's no precedent 先例 for that. They'll never do that.
[.my2]
是的，但这没有先例。他们绝不会那么做。


They'll renegotiate 重新谈判.
[.my2]
他们会重新谈判的。


-Well, that depends. -On what?

[.my2]
-嗯，那要看情况。 -看什么？


Well, you see, the banks know that the man they invested in can no longer function 运作, and as far as they're concerned 就他们而言, you're just some kid with nice hair.
[.my2]
嗯，你看，银行知道他们投资的那个人已经无法运作了，就他们而言，你只是个头发不错的小子。


You're making it quite fucking difficult to savor 品味 this moment, Gerri.
[.my2]
你让他妈的品味这一刻变得相当困难，格里。


I'm sorry about that.
[.my2]
对此我很抱歉。


Don't jump 别跳楼.
[.my2]
别跳楼。


We had hoped to see a response 反应 by now, but what we do know is that he's stable 情况稳定. So... if you want to grab some sleep 睡一会儿, this is a good time.
[.my2]
我们原本希望现在能看到一些反应，但我们知道的是他情况稳定。所以…如果你们想睡一会儿，现在是个好时机。


Night, Dad.
[.my2]
晚安，爸爸。


See you soon.
[.my2]
待会儿见。

== pure

Rava. Hey.

Uh, my dad's...

My dad's in the hospital.

Yeah, he had, I don't know,

I don't know what.

But, uh...

yeah, I don't know if he's gonna be OK.

It's... Yeah.

So... I don't know. I'm here with Jess.

We're just trying to get there...

What the...?

Can we just find a way around the traffic, man?

Just... Just... Just figure it out. Please!

Where's the ICU?

... blood pressure...

... tests...

What's the situation? Can somebody...

Excuse me.

They're working on him.

What is this part of the hospital?

I mean, is this the best section?

Excuse me? Doctor,

is this the best part of the hospital?

Sorry. You know, we just--we need to know.

The ICU is the ICU. This is the best place for him.

Is this where you would take your father?

I'm sorry. Can the team have some space? Please?

Hey, here's an idea. Why don't you worry about the medicine,

not the fucking feng shui?

Let's let the gentleman do his job.

Thank you.

-Let's do this for Dad. -Thank you.

Sorry.

Do they know who we are?

-I don't know. -Are they sandbagging us?

-Do they know who he is? -I don't know.

-Shall we call Mom? -What?

No. There's like a million people to call.

She's probably just make it about herself, anyway.

Come on. Your mom's a maniac, she's not a monster.

Folks, we need you to wait through there, please.

Hi. I'm sorry.

We're getting mixed messages here.

We have no clue what's going on.

We will be with you

as soon as we have an assessment.

OK, well, that's not good enough.

We need to know what's happening. Now.

The socio-economic health of multiple continents

is dependent on his well-being.

The socio-economic health of multiple continents?

Kendall. Everyone.

We have an area we can go to.

They'll keep us posted.

So, look, take me through what happened exactly.

Uh, I don't know, exactly.

It was weird. Um, it happened fast,

-we were just sitting there... -We were just talking.

We were talking, Shiv kind of started

-hard-balling Dad a little bit. -I wasn't hard-balling him.

A brain hemorrhage doesn't come from some chit-chat, asshole.

So it's definitely a brain hemorrhage? Is that what they said?

Somebody said that, right?

-Somebody said hemorrhage? -Or stroke? I...

-The ambulance... -A stroke is a hemorrhage.

-It is? -Yes.

Did someone say "Hemorrhage,"

or is it just us who said it?

It could be an aneurism.

Why aren't we chasing this?

I'll chase.

Hey, uh, is there any...

Did Dad ever talk to any of you guys about cryogenics?

You're insane.

Look, I don't want to be given the runaround

by Doctor-fucking-SUNY Purchase Medical School here.

We need to know who the top players are, OK?

Who's the top dog in this hospital?

Have you talked to Dad's neurologist?

Kendall, stop acting like the king of the hospital.

We're all trying to do our best, so just fuck off.

I'm on it. OK?

According to this, it sounds like a stroke,

but it could be an acute subdural hematoma.

Great. Get in there and operate, Doctor Google.

He once talked to me about cryogenics.

What? Wouldn't that just be typical?

All the other billionaires are strolling around in new bodies,

but not Dad, because we were

too embarrassed to actually discuss it.

He didn't talk to you about cryogenics.

You talked to him about cryogenics

because you're obsessed with cryogenics.

-I'm not really, Kendall. -And what he didn't tell you,

and what I'm telling you now,

is that you are an idiot.

Sticks and stones, Kenny.

Yeah, I know.

And on his birthday, too? It's so shitty.

So what's happening now?

Are you staying at the hospital?

I guess.

I mean, I think I've got a job,

but I don't know.

Logan said I did,

but Marcia was the only one to hear it,

so... and then he tragically,

you know, like, whatever.

Well, what sort of job? Is it a good job?

I don't know. Like,

could be anything.

And I have, like, 20 bucks left.

The world is so fucked up.

I am not sending you any more money, Greg.

Step up.

I'm not asking you to send me...

Look,

just make sure about the job.

-All right?  -Yeah, I know.

Hey, do you have cash?

Yeah. Uh...

no, just my last twenty.

That's fine. Thanks.

I just got mugged by Shiv.

Born in humble circumstances in Dundee, Scotland,

shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War,

Logan Roy grew up in poverty,

but died one of the richest

and most powerful men in America.

His widowed mother took the decision...

It's an ATN obituary.

They want us to OK it in case they have to run it.

Is it nice?

I mean, it's made by his own news division.

Doesn't say he was a prick.

You want to watch it?

No.

I would really love to see you.

Yes, it's appropriate. It could hardly be more appropriate.

Ok?

Yeah, OK. OK, good.

-Hey, Jess? -Mm-hmm?

There's nothing in here about our mom.

Or Connor's. They need to be included.

Yeah.

PJ says Aziz Kahn at Mayo Clinic is the best there is.

Sarah says Ann Wieman at NYU.

Ann Wieman? Is that... That's not who I have.

Well, it's the name I have.

Can you tell Sarah to give her a call?

-Sure. -Hey, Rome.

-Do you have regular?  -No, I've got...

Now I'm strapped. Was there any change at all?

-Hey, you guys. -What?

Could I have the change?

What is this? Already? People are sending shit already?

It's from Lawrence Yee at Vaulter.

Call him and tell him that is not fucking appreciated.

Mm-hmm.

-Kendall, I'm so sorry. -Thank you, Gerri.

Can you give me five?

We need to talk.

Over here, OK?

Obviously the nominating committee, the board,

has a plan in the event of Logan's incapacitation.

Sorry, do I need to hear this right now?

You do.

In the event that we, uh,

continue on our trajectory

of his current consciousness,

we're gonna need to announce a plan

by around 6:30, before the markets open,

in order to avoid a lot of funky chowder.

Did you say funky chowder?

We've set up down here.

What have you set up?

You're gonna want a place to just be,

and chill, you know?

We talked to some of the trustees of the hospital,

so everybody knows who's who.

Yeah. It's not a war room yet, but, um...

But if we need one, it's available.

Jesus.

Uh, so there's a bathroom through there...

-Hi, Karolina...  -Hi.

Thank you, guys.

So I have Dewi and Asha from the nominating committee on the line.

Kendall's here, and you're on speaker, guys.

So sorry to hear about the news.

Likewise.

As you know, our standing plan in the event of Logan's...

absence, is to separate his CEO and Chairman roles.

You'll become acting CEO,

Frank stays on as COO.

We'll need to act fast. Stabilize the stock price.

Dewi? Dewi?

I'm sorry...

my dad is my focus right now, OK?

Of course, it's just that there's a problem

in terms of the optics if what happened earlier today

between you two gets out.

I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about.

Sure. Well...

And then there's the problem with Frank.

-As in?  -Logan fired him

and promoted Roman.

Roman?

Jesus.

Look, I'm sorry, I...

I can't get into this right now, guys.

No, of course.

You are in no fit state.

But here's my take, OK?

My dad got sick today, right?

I don't know, I mean, nobody knows

when he started acting out of character,

but, like, he didn't seem great from the morning on,

and there's no paper on any of the moves made today.

-Right, Gerri? -Uh...

nothing meaningful.

Yeah, it was words.

Words are just, what?

Nothing.

Complicated air flow.

So, I mean, if I was saying what actually happened today,

it would be nothing.

Well, that certainly

makes things simpler from our point of view.

Do you think you can get the family behind it?

Yes.

And Frank?

Sure.

Dude, can't we just talk here?

You know Connor's invited Willa down?

What?! Here?!

What's the deal with their deal?

Unlike me, he has no sense of boundaries.

What the fuck?

It's stale, but it's empty, I think.

-Hello? -You wanna do a play?

No, I, um, just wanted to...

I've been thinking that maybe this might be

really tough on Marcia.

Yeah, you're thinkin' that?

What, will she put all her inheritance into gold or oil?

No, I just... No, I...

Look, I know that, like, the trust only comes into play

if certain things happen...

Yeah, he's dead, or brain dead.

Yeah, but I was thinkin', like...

wouldn't it be nice for Dad to wake up

and for all of us to have signed,

like he wanted?

You know, like a nice gesture?

And if he doesn't wake up,

we've basically signed over to Marcia

the power to choose the new Dad.

So... OK. So, for the record,

you are declining to sign on the change of trust?

-For the record? -Yeah.

What the fuck is this, McCarthyism?

I'm not declining, I'm just not...

I'm not "Clining." What the f...

OK. No. OK, just, you know,

that just seems very shitty under the circumstances.

What circumstances?

Well, you did make her husband's brain explode.

Fuck you, man!

Wait...

-Stop it! -You shit!

What, are you fuckin' insane?

No! No!

He...

He doesn't deserve this.

It's just so unfair.

He's a great... man.

He, like, let me come to his birthday lunch.

And he offered me a job.

Right?

He doesn't deserve this.

And... so, if there's anything that I can do,

let me know.

Actually, there is something.

-OK. -Can you go to the apartment

and get his bed things and slippers?

The ones with the dark checks.

You don't mind?

No, no. I'd be...

respectfully, uh, somberly willing.

Thank you.

-Now? -Please.

OK. All right.

Marcia, we can get

Colin or the driver to go and get his things.

I don't need this fly buzzing in my face.

Slippers, slippers, slippers, slippers, slippers.

Yeah, don't fuck it up.

Fuckin' long legs. Greg! Hey, I need a favor from you.

What's up?

Dad had some papers he wanted us to sign,

and they're in some envelopes,

just pick 'em up at the house, and bring 'em.

Yeah. Where are the papers?

They're in the house somewhere.

In envelopes--They're just in the house!

-You got it? -OK. I was imagining...

Oh, you're fucking tall. This is hurting my goddamn neck.

I have to go. OK? Just find the papers,

and bring 'em back.

Papers, and... and... they're gonna be just...

I am so done with this conversation.

-Just handle it, OK? -All right. Yeah.

Better not fuck this one up.

I don't want Logan Roy's newspapers

goin' through my trash cans.

-Oh, my God! We've killed... -Logan.

We're bastards!

Turn that off.

Roman, no. Turn it off.

-We've killed... -Logan.

We're...

What are they saying?

Just rumors, you know.

He was taken to the hospital,

some of Twitter says he's dead,

and also a good deal of, um,

of rejoicing at our father's potential demise.

Can we find out who these fuckers are

and, like... report them?

Or just, like, screen grab their shit.

-OK. -So we know? Yeah?

So, I don't know where Kendall is, but...

Hi. Really sorry, you guys.

Thanks, Willa.

Why don't we sit over here.

Oh, there's Ken.

It's gross.

News is out.

OK, right. Well...

So, um, listen.

I don't even want to think about this,

but I just spoke to the nominating committee,

and, uh...

the thing is that the plan

is to announce that I take over from Dad.

-Well, no. -Excuse me?

-What do you mean? -I mean,

we're waiting for the results of the scan.

It's a pointless conversation.

OK, well, let's talk about it.

I can't talk about it. I'm upset.

Hey! I'm upset too.

Oh, not too upset to go and fucking plot

-with the suits. -Fuck you! OK?

I could hardly hear them for the blood rushing in my ears.

Isn't there a plan anyways? Like...

Yes, there's a plan.

That's what I'm fucking telling you.

The plan is that Frank and I will take over...

-Frank was fired. So.. -Yeah.

OK. Well, I mean, let's d-discuss

and just see where we are, right?

I'm not doing this.

If Dad dies, I don't want

to be talking about this shit when he dies.

He won't die.

Yeah, this is great. Thank you.

Hey, man.

Sorry, I'm... I'm really sorry,

but I don't have any money for the cab.

I'm sorry, sir, do I know you?

Yeah, I-I was here a little earlier.

I got assaulted a little in there.

So can you pay for the cab, please?

She was supposed to call,

but maybe she didn't because there's an emergency,

uh, happening.

Sir, I'm sorry,

I don't know who you are.

OK, so he's not gonna lend me the money.

So, I don't know, um...

You know, he... Pretty much, he owes you your money.

He owes me the...?

You better give me the money, dude.

You guys need to work this out for yourselves,

because basically one of you guys

hasn't got $14, OK?

Yes, ma'am.

Hello, Mrs. Roy?

Thank you.

I'm so sorry.

It's so weird.

I actually like hospitals.

Lots of people don't. But they're safe.

The weird thing for me

is that I was, well,

I'd been intending to talk to Logan,

you know, and make a... make a proposal,

a very decent proposal, to Shiv.

Actually been meaning to ask for his blessing for a while,

but, uh... now it's very difficult.

You need to find the right time

for these conversations.

Right.

The weird thing I'm thinkin' now is,

do you think Logan would still like to be asked?

You know? I mean, I know he can't reply,

but would he appreciate the gesture

if he was told about it later?

Or even in the case...

in the case of the worst... case,

would it have been nice to have asked his body?

Rumors continue to circulate about the health of...

Hey, hey. They're ready.

They have the results.

OK. Fuck.

You OK?

Yeah. Yeah. He'll be fine.

He's probably in there eating a fucking chicken bucket

and yelling at someone.

He's had a hemorrhagic stroke,

a bleed in the deep right hemisphere

that put pressure on the thalamus and the brain stem,

and that's what caused a loss of consciousness.

So, what, do you operate?

We don't do that with deep bleeds, especially in older patients.

-He's not an older patient. -Dude, he just turned 80.

But physically, he's, like,

still in his 70s, and he's in great shape.

The evidence is that operating

in situations like these isn't worthwhile.

So, then, what do you do?

You can't do nothing.

We will carry out regular observations,

and hopefully we'll see some improvement soon.

That's not good enough. Right, Dr. Judith? That's...

It's an excellent department.

Well, thank you for your input,

but you'll understand if we check out our options.

My assistant's been in touch with Ann Wieman at NYU,

and we might move Dad there.

No. He stays here.

He gets better here.

Well, we can discuss.

We'll discuss and get back to you.

No. No discussion.

I am his next of kin. I am his proxy.

I am in charge. Thank you.

Good. Well...

we'll move Logan to a suite in Greenberg.

I'll show you the way.

I'm sure you have some questions.

Feel free to ask me on the way up.

-I'm sorry, Ken. -Thanks for coming over.

OK, so look.

We don't know what's going on.

He could be fine; he could not.

Either way, he's not gonna be back tomorrow,

so, long story short,

will you carry on as COO, step up on the board...

-Become acting chairman. -Yes.

-No. -What?

He fired me, Ken.

He... I...

Look, I don't know if he even knew what he was saying...

if his brain was working.

His brain was working fine.

Well, whatever else, there's no proof, legally,

-that yesterday even happened. -That's not the problem.

-So what's the problem? -I don't want to be chairman.

I am just an attendant lord, here to swell a scene or two.

What the fuck does that mean?

Come on, don't do that.

We could do great things together.

Mm-hmm.

So what do you need, Frank?

A jazillion dollars in unmarked Bitcoin.

I don't have a price, Ken.

-Frank, I don't understand. -Ju... We'll talk.

There's a lot of mess to be cleaned up, Kendall,

but you can do it, son.

You can.

And there's nothing I can say to change your mind?

I'm sorry about your father.

And good luck, Kenny.

Yeah?

I told Greg to bring the change of trust.

-What? -And when he does,

I think we should sign it.

I... I'm not doing anything without my lawyer present.

OK. Well, I'm going to sign it, I'm getting Connor to sign it.

It's gonna make you look pretty fucking heartless when you don't.

Don't give me a fuckin' scary look.

You hit me, I will fuck you up.

Fuck.

Yeah.

God, you're so annoying.

Shut up.

-Hello? -Greg.

Hey. Did you find those contracts Roman asked for?

Uh, I... Yes, I got 'em.

Oh, I think you have the wrong ones.

Uh, OK.

Right.

What, uh, what shall I do?

Look, there's a lot of confusion.

'Cause if you have any doubt, maybe you can't find them,

and that might be simplest.

But if I do,

'cause I...

I think I have the right ones here.

Don't bring them in.

Did he change his mind?

No. I'm just telling you:

Don't bring them in.

Ok. Ok. S...

All right, I get... I get it.

So, who's the...

Like, what's the chain of command here?

Are you the more senior sibling?

Greg,

it's simple.

This is a favor I'd like you to do for me,

and I'd like you to be discreet.

You stay for a while, you can't find them,

you come back. OK?

-OK. -Thank you.

This is better.

look, so, I know you don't want to talk about this,

I'm just informing you, Roman as a board member

and Shiv as a shareholder,

I'll be taking temporary charge as CEO and Chairman.

Frank is not interested in the position at present.

No. I'm sorry, but even if we were talking about this,

which we are not, it wouldn't necessarily be you.

I'm sorry, then who the fuck would it be?

I don't know. Anyone.

It could be me.

Are you insane?

-Dad made me COO. -I don't think so, dude.

Dad wasn't thinking straight.

I think he was.

You? The chief operating officer?

-Yup. -I mean, if that wasn't a sign

he was loco in the coco, I don't know what is.

Well, I don't see it that way.

Come on. It was a negotiating position, Rome.

He was fuckin' playing you

to get you to sign the change of trust.

Do you even know what it fucking involves?

I mean, he conked out mid-game.

Are you calling me a dipshit?

No. I love you, man, but you're not a serious person.

All right, fuck you. He's alive, you're not the fuckin' boss.

All right! Come on. Let's not throw shit around.

We're in the middle, so let's just sit tight. No sudden moves.

We need to move. The markets are gonna

want to know who's behind the wheel.

We need to control the narrative.

"Control the narrative." You probably yell that when you cum.

"Oh! Control the narrative! Oh! Control it...

Control the narrative! Uhh..."

Fuck you. We're in a hospital.

Everyone knows.

We have to say something.

No. Actually, we don't. 'Cause no one knows how serious it is.

So we don't have to say anything.

Actually, we do. The SEC.

There are rules, there are laws...

Oh, no. The law? Well, we can't break the law.

Hey, Karolina?

Has a CEO ever been out of action

and people haven't been told?

Um, not that I can think of. There was Apple, but that...

Right, but if we... wanted to drag our feet on this,

until we figure the moves...

Well, once we do know,

there's a duty to shareholders to let people...

Yeah, but I don't... I don't know what we know.

I mean, this could be an allergic reaction.

-It could be the flu. -Oh, come on.

Look at the fuckin' orchids. This is out there.

It's like we're being held hostage in the Honolulu airport.

But if we wanted to say something, you know, other than...

It's called a lie, Shiv.

When you say the thing that's not, that's a lie.

We'll need to make a holding statement.

Of course, I'm open to your suggestions

on how to... finesse it.

Perfect. We'll make a decision and get back to you shortly.

Logan Roy, CEO and chairman of Waystar corporation...

So, what do you think I do?

Well, I don't know. What did she say?

Roman said bring in the papers,

Shiv said don't bring in the papers.

Well, I guess you need to decide

which one of them is more important?

I guess Roman's... in the company,

but Shiv seems like, I don't know, more bossy?

All right. Well, can you just take some of the papers?

Plus, I don't know about these slippers.

Like, they're all plaid.

Does "Checked" mean plaid?

'Cause then there's gingham, there's tartan...

It's like a crisscross fuckin' minefield.

Oh, fuck the slippers, Greg.

You have to strategize.

I'm trying to strategize, Mom, with you!

But you won't strategize.

Hey. What's up, Kendall?

You mix me up with your sponsor?

Listen, I'm just calling to issue a reminder.

Your pecker's in my pocket, OK,

Dickless Dickleby?

You do what I say.

Let others say what they want, but we stay dark.

You get me? No reporting on what went down yesterday,

the turmoil.

Well, I can do whatever I want,

because Vaulter and our satellite sites

have editorial independence...

as set out in that piece of paper you signed.

You know what that piece of paper is to me?

Nothing. OK?

I'd jerk off on that paper and send it to you as a greeting card.

Simon says, Mum's the word.

Motherfucker.

Hey. Sorry to bother you so late.

Hey, let's put something together

about the Roy family shitshow.

So, and I don't want to get into this, but

maybe we should just cut off the whole Kendall CEO thing

so that it doesn't get painful.

Well, I mean, I'm not looking for it,

but I guess I'm already COO,

so one more step...

It's not gonna be you.

-Because? -Come on.

-I don't know what that means. -Yes, you do.

Well, it doesn't matter who does it.

It's just temporary, so anyone will do.

Yeah, sure. Anyone.

-Tom. -Tom?

OK, fine.

Karl.

Prick. Eva?

Cunt.

Okay. So?

Someone Dad trusts.

But Dad doesn't trust anyone, except Frank,

and he fired Frank for shits and giggles.

Gerri?

I don't love Gerri.

But I don't hate Gerri.

So, Gerri.

I'll talk to her.

So, Gerri.

How ya doin'?

Oh, I'm fine.

This is where they brought Baird, so it's a little...

Baird?

Yeah, Baird. My husband.

Shiv's godfather?

Oh, does he, um... with the tortoise?

-Yeah. -Fuck, yeah. Of course.

-How is he? -He's dead.

I know. I know. I remember... you...

So, uh, Gerri, uh,

just wanted to say thanks

for captaining us through this shitstorm.

Um, you do a good job,

Gerri, you, uh,

you're, um, you're a real good job-doer.

I suck at the whole corporate flirt thing.

You know, I just...

I like to lube up and fuck, you know?

-ok. -ok.

So, um... for me and Shiv,

the whole Kendall thing doesn't work.

So we were thinkin'... general counsel...

you know where the bodies are buried.

You probably buried 'em yourself.

So...

you would have the family's support

to step in and take the reins.

That's a very generous offer,

but I'm going to have to decline.

OK. Can, uh, can I ask why?

Why I don't want the job that makes your brain explode?

OK, but, um, uh...

G-Gerri, excuse me,

but I... I've always thought of you...

and I mean this in the best possible way...

as a stone-cold killer bitch.

Who says you don't know how to flirt?

Ok.

Hey. Can I get a moment alone with you, do you think?

-I... -Have you seen this?

I'm so sorry about your father.

Thank you. Would you give us a minute?

Yeah.

Thanks, Willa.

Tom, would you mind?

Oh, come on. I'm not the same as her.

Ken.

Vaulter's running a story about how the company's in turmoil.

Don't we own him?

"Shit Show at the Fuck Factory"?

Yeah. Uncertainty, discord.

That is not a good story.

"Family gets behind other member of family,"

that's a good story.

Oh, fuck them.

I mean, when Jobs was dying, Apple didn't say anything.

We're in a hospital, Shiv. Everyone knows.

We can't just prop him up and wave his hand

and say he's fine like they did

in the Politburo or Weekend at fuckin' Bernie's.

I like the sound of that, though.

Look,

you can't put a value on a human life,

except in our case, you rather precisely can

because when trading opens tomorrow,

we're gonna drop like a stone.

The only question is, what's the bottom?

I think I'm the best option.

I just want to say that, uh,

if you need me to... go get sandwiches or coffee

or step up from Regional Parks and run North America, I can,

and I will. And that's just an offer on the table...

-Fuck off, Tom. -Fuck you, Kendall.

-Don't talk to Tom like that. -It's OK. It's fine.

I was about to be announced.

I mean, how can I not be the logical choice?

Because you were about to be announced,

Ken, and then you weren't.

I mean, the only thing we know for certain,

like for absolute certain, tonight,

is that Dad didn't want you running the company.

So if there was a list of 7 billion people on this planet

that Dad would choose to be boss,

we know you would be last.

Dad fired you, man.

No, he did not fire me.

He said it was just gonna take a little longer.

But he said that to be nice.

What I think he meant to say was

that he wished that Mom gave birth to a can opener

because at least then it would be useful.

You're a dick.

-That's... -Too far?

Look, the board are offering this to me.

I don't actually need your backing.

You actually really, totally do.

I think you do.

Without it, after what Dad did to you,

I mean, we could probably take any appointment to court.

Jesus, Shiv, we're talking about court now?

Fuck you!

I didn't even want to talk about this, remember?

What do you... What do you have against me?

-Nothing. -Nothing?

Oh, you want me to actually say?

-Yes, I do. -You lack killer instinct,

you're wet, you're green, you're intellectually insecure,

-Bullshit. -you're not emotionally strong enough,

-you have addiction issues. -That's enough!

I don't think all that, I'm just trying to be Dad's voice.

Bravo. It was an excellent impression.

I just want to say I'm not getting involved.

Good.

But Shiv's right.

I'm not saying I would make a better CEO,

that's unsaid--

It's not unsaid when you say it.

No, I'm saying I'm not saying it,

so, in fact, it is unsaid.

Hey, pal, why don't you go help Willa with her homework?

Ouch. Asshole.

Listen, why don't you decide everything.

I don't care. I just observe.

I'm a UN white helmet. All right?

Guys--

who else are you gonna get?

I think Shiv would be great.

That's what I think.

Thanks, honey,

but... no way.

I mean, she doesn't work in the company

and has no experience of the company

and the markets would freak,

but apart from that, I agree with you.

I mean, we have options.

Sure. You could all ask for morphine

so you can stay in your painless fucking fantasy world

where the orchids dance

and the company is run by a magical fucking unicorn!

Fuck your options.

Hello, this is Greg on Greg's phone.

-Greg. How ya doin'? -Yeah, I'm just, um,

not dawdling.

You're still at the fucking apartment?

You've been there forever.

Uh, just, um...

I know you're picking up PJs and all that shit,

just grab a sweater, maybe, also. My dad's, OK?

-OK. Which sweater? -It doesn't matter.

Not something washed. Something that he's worn, maybe.

-If you find one. -OK, yeah.

If he's worn it, if his...

How am I gonna know if it's worn?

Just smell it. OK?

Jesus! I just want something that smells like him, OK?

I just want that. Is that enough for you?

Dude, that's really nice.

I would want that if this was my situation, too.

So I'll sniff some stuff for you...

Just... Whatever. And if you tell anyone about this,

I will... cut your dick off.

And don't forget those papers I told you to bring.

And, uh, thank you.

Fuck off.

Yeah.

I... apologize if my bell summoned you.

It's, um...

-It's like 4:00 a.M. -Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

Put the kids to bed and thought I was missing all the fun, so...

How are they doing?

-The kids? -Yeah.

They're OK.

Maybe you could bring them by tomorrow.

So they can say their... you know, say their... hellos.

-Yeah. -OK.

How are you feeling?

Good. Yeah.

Yeah. How am I feeling?

Fuck. Ask me another?

-Jesus, what a day for you. -Yeah.

The nominating committee want me to be the big boss.

Really?

But Shiv and Roman won't back me

because of what Dad said at lunch.

Jesus.

-Yeah. -Ah, your family is so...

fucked.

I'm sorry, but... Wow.

I'm sorry.

Ken, I...

What can I say? It's... I don't know.

Adrenaline.

It's just my body.

I'm glad you're here.

Yeah. I can tell.

-Hey. Look. Stop. Stop. -No. I'm not in the mood.

There's something I have to say to you.

-What? -Siobhan Roy...

Oh, my God.

... will you marry me?

What... the fuck? Seriously?

I love you.

And I wanted to do something to make all this better.

And I thought while your dad's still with us,

wouldn't that be a nice thing?

We can get a quick wedding.

What is it about my dad dying in a sterile environment

that screams big romantic gesture to you?

Well, it's a horrible day, I thought...

thought it would be a nice... thing.

Tom, you can't balance it out like that.

I'm not gonna... give you a blow job when your dog dies.

Right?

Yeah. OK.

It's fine. I misjudged it. I get it.

No, I'm s-sorry. Honey, I'm sorry.

I'm... This is...

Let's just not have this as the moment.

Why don't you do this again properly another time.

No! Exactly. This is not the moment.

This didn't happen. Abort. Abort, abort,

Good. OK.

But so you know,

yeah, whatever.

-Yes? Yes? -Yeah.

When it happens, yes.

Yes? Yes!

-Really? -Yeah. I...

Yeah.

-It's such a shitshow. -What is?

My family.

Our family.

-Our family. -Yeah.

So I got the slippers.

Thank you.

Yeah, I finally found 'em.

Can you put them in there, please?

Yeah.

So, you got the slippers.

Uh-huh.

I guess that makes you Prince Charming.

I guess so.

You saying you want to fuck Marcia?

What?! No. Wh-Why would you say that?

That's what you just said.

No. It isn't.

You said you were Prince Charming.

-No, you just said that. -I'm kidding.

I'm kidding.

Ok.

Do you know that, uh...

Do you know that he gave me a job?

What job?

-I don't know. -OK.

-Do you know when I start? -No. Obviously I don't know.

-Why would I know? -I don't know.

I thought you might know 'cause I thought everybody's talking

and, like, might be talking about me?

No, everybody was talking about you this whole time.

Everyone was only talking about you, Cousin Greg.

I get it.

Ha ha.

Hey. Hey.

When you, uh, figure all this out,

come in and see me. OK?

And, uh, and I'll look after you.

All right?

I'm serious. I will.

-Sure. -Thanks, man.

That's OK.

All right, later.

Take it easy, Greg.

Yo, come here for a second.

So, listen.

I've been thinking... This is my vision.

We got for it. Me and you.

CEO and COO.

Me and my homey Romey.

I thought I was a fuckhead.

Uh, dipshit, and you said that.

You said I wasn't serious.

Sorry. It's been a long day.

Yeah.

But dude, seriously.

Me and you, bro.

Like, I could teach you.

And you could, you know, teach me.

And Shiv?

I mean, you know what Shiv's like.

Ultimately she's a daddy's girl. Right?

I mean, she wants to play it safe.

We're the ones with the nuts to fuckin' revolutionize.

OK, I'm not uninterested.

All right, then, let's fuckin' do it.

Here's the thing. Gerri just turned down the top job.

So does that mean something?

Are you fuckin' with me?

Nope.

Who asked Gerri?

It was broached.

-It was broached? -Yeah.

By who? Did you broach? You broached it, didn't you?

Don't pin the broach on me, OK? Everyone was broaching.

Just want to make sure we trust each other.

Everything up front, OK?

All right.

Ok.

Shake on it or something?

Official?

Oh. OK.

Hi.

Oh, come on.

Hey. Hey, knock it off.

Thank you, Willa.

So, listen, I've asked Roman to be acting COO...

-Actual COO. -...to my acting CEO.

-And you said? -I said why not?

-Snake. -Sis, please,

I'm trying to bring everyone together here. I'm mediating.

-Well, I'm saying no. -Me too.

I thought you were a fucking white helmet.

Sometimes a peacekeeper has

to go shoot a maniac on the perimeter, OK?

What the fuck? Why would you say no to this and yes to Gerri?

Gerri has been with the company for 20 years. Dad trusts her.

She's older. She's wiser. She's a mature person...

such as myself.

Well, she doesn't want it.

OK, so in my opinion, we should find someone else.

-Temporary. -OK, like who?

I don't know, someone neutral.

Eva or... American Psycho, what...

-Karl. -Karl. Yeah.

And what if it isn't temporary,

what if he uses his position to make it permanent?

Because he wouldn't do that. He's nice! He brought coffee.

Oh, he brought coffee.

Then we should definitely let him take control of the company.

Dude, he's not gonna take control of the company.

Look, it's a gamble.

It's either me and Roman and us as a family,

or it's Eva and Karl,

or some fuckface suit from the Deep State of the company.

They could take the company out of our hands,

and we'd never get near it again.

If Dad wakes up, and he's frail,

and he's looking at the end game,

you want to be the one who tells him

his family business isn't family-run anymore?

I mean, maybe you could get away with it...

-you know, his favorite. -Oh, fuck you.

But maybe you wouldn't stay his favorite

if you gave away the firm.

Look, we need a statement by 6:30.

So you just have to think...

like, bullshit aside...

who do you think, really, Dad would prefer?

What's up, fam?

Oh. Yeah... did you get the papers?

-What? -The pap...

The papers in the envelope? I called you?

Dude... Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

So no, basically?

I was thinking about your dad,

-I was up there... -Hey, don't worry about it.

My head was just messed up.

OK. We're gonna have to announce. Where are we at?

While Dad is ill,

the family proposes that Kendall run the company

with Roman as COO.

I hereby concur.

OK. OK...

I will let the committee know the family's position,

and pending board approval, we can announce.

-Congratulations, Kendall. -Thanks, Gerri.

And Roman, congratulations.

This is all very exciting.

Difficult decision.

For the record,

I personally believe this to be a total fucking disaster.

OK, good.

Kendall, um, listen,

we need to talk.

I'm sorry, I just need to...

I just need a conversation with you in private.

What is this?

There's a few things you should know.

OK, there's no way to put this nicely,

so forgive me for stating it baldly,

but, there's a huge debt problem.

What are you... No.

-Yes. Three billion. -No, there's not.

Fuck off. I'd know.

No one knows.

Well, me and Frank.

What about... Dad?

Yeah, your dad.

Hence the debt.

Gerri, what the fuck is going on?

Where did the money go?

In 1985,

Logan needed cash badly for the expansion into parks,

so he took out a loan through the family holding company.

He knew that besides Frank,

none of the other boards members could see what was happening.

And then he added that loan

to the company's already considerable debt.

Son of a bitch.

Ok.

Ok.

We can deal.

Yeah, but Kendall, the thing is,

it's secured against Waystar's stock...

and when the stock hits 130,

they can pursue repayment in full.

Which, if they decided to do that, would eviscerate us.

Yeah, but there's no precedent for that. They'll never do that.

They'll renegotiate.

-Well, that depends. -On what?

Well, you see, the banks know that the man they invested in

can no longer function, and as far as they're concerned,

you're just some kid with nice hair.

You're making it quite fucking difficult

to savor this moment, Gerri.

I'm sorry about that.

Don't jump.

We had hoped to see a response by now,

but what we do know is that he's stable. So...

if you want to grab some sleep, this is a good time.

Night, Dad.

See you soon.
