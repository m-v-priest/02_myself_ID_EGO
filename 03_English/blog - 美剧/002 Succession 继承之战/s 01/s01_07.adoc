## 🎭 场景分析与关键词总结

这段对话是**家族治疗 (Family Therapy)** 的核心冲突部分。治疗师试图引导家族成员面对洛根的权力，但洛根和孩子们都在**逃避真诚的交流**，将治疗变成了**权力和公关的战场**。

### 👑 权力与治疗的对决

* **洛根的防御与敷衍 (Logan's Defenses):** 洛根用一句空洞的**“我一生所做的一切都是为了我的孩子 (I've done for my children)”**来应付治疗，并直言不讳地表示他可以**“编造 (make this shit up)”**。当治疗师要求他表达**“感受 (feeling)”**时，他回答**“I need to check my emails”**，彻底否定了情感在场的重要性。
* **公关活动 (Publicity Event):** 希芙和治疗师揭露了这次活动的主要目的——**照片和采访 (photo and an interview)**，这是一场**公关作秀**，而不是真正的治疗。这让希芙感到愤怒，因为她为此放弃了重要的政治会面。
* **“弑父 (Patricide)”的暗示:** 在康纳的农场，一个当地人向汤姆描述了**康纳要求别人为他杀死他患癌的狗**的故事，这是一个**关于逃避责任和让别人代劳“杀戮”**的黑暗隐喻，呼应了肯德尔试图**“弑父”**的行动，但最终却**让父亲为自己承担责任**的家族主题。

### 💔 信任的崩塌与质疑

* **洛根的谎言:** 罗曼和希芙当着治疗师的面，**公开质疑洛根**关于**肯德尔吸毒新闻泄露**的声明（**“I had nothin' to do with those stories.”**）。
    * **希芙：** **“Honestly, no. I think this whole thing is fake.”** （老实说，不。我认为整件事都是虚假的。）
    * **罗曼：** **“no, I don't believe him.”** （不，我不相信他。）
* **洛根的屈服 (I'm Sorry!):** 在孩子们的一致质疑下，洛根最终被迫**道歉 (I'm sorry!)** 并承认自己**“can't get into everything”**，这在洛根的历史上是**极其罕见和勉强**的屈服。他随后以**“也许我饿了 (Maybe I'm hungry)”**来迅速结束讨论。

### ⚡️ 罗曼的恶趣味

* **罗曼的刻薄讽刺:** 罗曼用**“Maybe don't deny Dad's feelings, Shiv.”**（也许不要否认爸爸的感受）来讽刺洛根**将查看邮件当作感受**，并在洛根最终道歉后，再次用**“Now you're denying their feelings, Dad.”**（现在你否认了**他们**的感受）来**双重讽刺**洛根，强调了洛伊家族成员之间相互的恶意和尖锐。

## 🎭 场景分析与关键词总结

这段对话是**家族治疗的彻底失败**，引向了一个戏剧性的意外（汤姆受伤），以及希芙**正式回归政治**的决定。

### 💧 治疗的彻底崩溃

* **希芙的逃离 (Shiv's Escape):** 希芙认为治疗是**“妄想的 (delusional)”**和**“假装的 (not taking this seriously)”**。在洛根敷衍了事后，她决定**放弃公关作秀**，重新**转向政治**，前往圣达菲与**吉尔·伊维斯**会面。这标志着她**拒绝了家族的控制**。
* **罗曼的讽刺 (Roman's Irony):** 罗曼将**水**比作**“太优柔寡断 (too wishy-washy)”**，以此讽刺洛根对任何**不可控因素**的不信任。他仍然留在农场准备**“公关照片 (photos)”**。

### 💔 康纳与薇拉的“交易”

* **康纳的求爱 (Con's Proposal):** 康纳向薇拉求婚的表达极其**笨拙**且**非浪漫**，他将**“爱 (love)”**比作**“奇特的折磨”**和**“病毒”**，并试图用**“津贴 (allowance)”**和**“剧院生活 (life in the theater)”**来**“买断”**她，要求她留下来。
* **薇拉的接受 (Willa's Acceptance):** 薇拉在**权衡利弊**后接受了康纳的“交易”，她用**“我们可以试试 (we could try)”**来回应，表明他们的结合是一场**基于利益的权宜之计**。

### 🚨 意外与混乱 (Tom's Accident)

* **汤姆的意外 (The Accident):** 汤姆在罗曼的嘲弄下（**“Jump, ya fuckin' pussy!”**）**头朝下跳进了浅水区**，**撞伤了头部和牙齿**。
* **洛根的反应 (Logan's Reaction):** 洛根的反应极具**讽刺性**和**商人本色**：他立刻派遣安全主管**科林**去处理，并担心汤姆会**“爱打官司 (litigious)”**。这表明在洛根眼中，**人命的价值低于法律风险和公关形象**。

### ⚔️ 政治的交锋 (Shiv vs. Gil)

* **身份标签 (The Labels):** 希芙和吉尔在会面开始时，互相用**尖锐的标签**定义对方：
    * **吉尔称希芙:** **“The acceptable face of the worst family in America.”** （美国最差家庭中**可接受的门面**。）
    * **希芙反击吉尔:** **“Stalin in a plaid shirt.”** （穿着**格子衬衫的斯大林**。）
* **希芙的坦诚 (Honest Start):** 希芙以**“我的家人完蛋了 (my family's fucked)”**作为开场白，直接面对了自己**背景的丑闻**，以求得**与吉尔的真诚合作**，标志着她**正式投入政治生涯**。

## 🎭 场景分析与关键词总结

这段对话主要涵盖了**希芙在政治和家族之间的抉择**，以及**肯德尔自我毁灭的升级**。

### 🕊️ 希芙的政治决断与代价

* **工作邀请 (Job Offer):** 吉尔·伊维斯（Gil Eavis）正式向希芙提供了一个职位，但条件极其苛刻，即希芙必须**“go to war with your family”**（与你的家人开战）。
* **政治与家族的权衡:** 希芙明白要**“为国家利益 (for the good of the country)”**工作，就意味着她必须牺牲自己与**洛根和韦斯塔科（Waystar Co.）的联系**，甚至牺牲掉汤姆。她最终**接受了吉尔的提议**（**“Fuck, yes.”**），选择了独立于家族的政治生涯。
* **汤姆的牺牲 (Tom's Sacrifice):** 汤姆得知希芙接受工作的前提是**“fire you”**（解雇你）后，表现出**令人心碎的平静**（**“It’s fine.”**），这表明他愿意为了希芙的宏大抱负而牺牲自己的利益和职业。

### 💊 肯德尔的失控与营救

* **肯德尔的吸毒 (Taking Drugs):** 肯德尔在**新墨西哥州**的一群陌生人（“狼孩”张、塔纳、麦克）的屋子里**吸食甲基苯丙胺 (meth/crank)**。他用**“玩得很开心，妈妈 (having a lot of fun, Mom)”**来回应罗曼，显示出一种**孩童般的、逃避现实的、自毁性的兴奋状态**。
* **罗曼的营救 (Roman's Rescue):** 罗曼打给肯德尔的电话，意外得知肯德尔**吸毒失控**，并拿到了他的**实时定位 (drop me a fucking pin)**。这迫使罗曼放弃了洛根交给他的**公关任务 (call Japan)**，转而扮演**“好兄弟”**的角色，前往营救肯德尔。
* **肯德尔对父亲的愤怒:** 肯德尔面对罗曼时，先是**用法律条款攻击罗曼**（**fiduciary duty**，**employment contract**），然后才转向**自毁式的嬉笑**。他将自己**正在吸食的毒品**比作**“装满鸡蛋的空客 (airbus full of eggs)”**，暗示这是一种**会带来灾难性崩溃**的兴奋。

### 📸 洛根的公关与帝国心态

* **公关照的“帝国” (Imperial Photo):** 摄影师称洛根的家族照片**“看起来帝王般 (looks imperial)”**，洛根欣然接受。这突显了洛根将这次家族团聚视为**巩固自身权力和形象**的**“帝国象征”**。
* **富豪的玩笑 (Rich Jokes):** 汤姆用一系列关于**“洛根如何富裕”**的夸张笑话（如**“金鱼穿皮草”**，**“精子戴单片眼镜”**）来**发泄**和**麻痹**自己即将被希芙“牺牲”的痛苦。

## 🎭 场景分析与关键词总结

这段对话是家族**“治疗之旅 (Austerlitz)”**的高潮和最终的毁灭性结束，以**洛根对孩子们的残酷攻击**和**肯德尔的失控**收尾。

### 🐍 罗伊家族的权力与背叛

* **洛根的愤怒与背叛感:** 洛根得知希芙**投靠敌人吉尔·伊维斯 (Eavis)** 后极度愤怒。他将希芙的行为视为**“反叛 (rebellion)”**和**“破坏 (sabotage)”**，并将其等同于**人身攻击 (bag of piss)** 的暴徒。这表明洛根认为**家族成员的政治独立**是对他**核心权力**的**威胁**。
* **希芙的反击:** 希芙将洛根的**商业模式**贬低为**“高级妓女 (high-class hooker)”**，指责洛根通过**“诱惑总统 (seducing presidents)”**来操纵国家。这是她**最尖锐的一次反击**，完全否定了洛根自我标榜的“商业战略”。
* **康纳的被利用感:** 康纳表达了他对家族治疗是**公关作秀**的不满，并对洛根只顾工作而**长期忽视他**的事实表达了**委婉的控诉**（**“我练习了挺久了 (I've had a bit of practice)”**）。

### 💔 洛根对希芙的致命攻击

* **“懦夫 (Coward)”:** 洛根对希芙发起了**最私密、最痛苦**的攻击。他指责希芙选择汤姆是因为她**“害怕竞争 (scared to compete)”**，以及害怕在真正的权力关系中**“被背叛 (being betrayed)”**。这个词**“懦夫”**击中了希芙的**核心不安全感**，也是洛根用来**控制和定义**她人生的武器。
* **“无名小卒 (Nobody)”:** 在康纳试图干预时，洛根毫不留情地将其称为**“他妈的无名小卒 (fucking nobody)”**，再次**碾压了康纳脆弱的自尊**和“长子”地位。

### 💊 肯德尔的疯狂与“乐趣”

* **失控的狂欢:** 肯德尔在吸食甲基苯丙胺后**精神状态极度失控**，他公开承认自己**“疯了 (off my nut)”**，并嘲讽地将家族治疗称为一个**“有趣的 (fun)”**游戏。
* **罗曼的拒绝:** 罗曼在**毒瘾发作**的肯德尔和**愤怒的洛根**之间选择了**假装没看见**（**“He doesn't even fuckin' notice.”**）。罗曼最终在车上，在肯德尔的**胡言乱语**和**持续播放《狮子王》歌曲**的干扰下，再次**逃避**了洛根交给他的**工作任务 (Japan launch)**，凸显了**手足之情**此刻优先于**商业责任**。

### 🎭 结论：一场闹剧

* **治疗师的象征性死亡:** 罗曼用**“我们的治疗师死了 (Our therapist died)”**来总结治疗，这个比喻指的正是**汤姆的意外**，完美地象征了**家族治疗的荒谬和失败**。
* **洛根的宽慰:** 洛根在孩子们离开后，对玛西娅说他感到**“宽慰 (relieved)”**，因为**“只剩下我们的时候会更好 (It'll be nicer when it's just us)”**，这证实了他**从一开始就没有真诚地想要修补关系**，他只想要**自己的舒适和控制**。

== pure



Mr. Roy.

Logan Roy! Mind if I get a quick photo?

- I'm a big fan. - Step back.

Big, big fan. I-I love your work.

I love everything you do. I love all the racism, misogyny...

Step off.

- It's really cool stuff! - Security!

Logan, over here!

My fuckin' piss!

You're fuckin' monopolist scum!

- Did it get in your eye? - I hope you die!

Can you open this up, please?

- I want no one else in here. - All right, stay back.

Can we get another shirt down here?

We had an incident outside with Mr. Roy.

How many people do you think pissed in that bag

to get all that piss?

I mean, it's just urine.

I'm good, I'm good.

No fuss, no fuss, I'm good. OK?

- Are you OK? - Fine.

Don't get all over me.

- Ok? - Ok.

These trust fund YouTube shits.

God, we had a couple of these guys...

I'm here. OK?

Now, I understand

you want me to go through my every thought with you.

I appreciate finally getting a chance

to talk through these very major moves you're considering, yes.

We've become aware

of some very desirable assets that are available.

A block of local TV stations.

Highly undervalued.

Teevvvee...

I remember those.

We still have one of those in my gym.

It's so great to have the wisdom of my son's

college drinking buddy in the room.

I just love the way he asks me for money.

No, I get it.

But there is a pressing issue, right?

Well, it's part of a larger strategy.

No, I... I get all that.

I'm just... All right.

I think the issue here, sir,

is that everyone fucking hates you.

It's cloudy, it's sunny.

You want to push through a massive

politically sensitive buy-up,

and I'm reading this over my morning cappuccino.

It says your family is a horror show

and it's destroying America.

Maybe we should buy this.

Kendall launched a lawsuit against you.

You have fired half of your board.

Your COO is a fucking joke.

Bro, that's what people are saying. Who cares if it's true?

People say that he's a coked-up dauphin

that doesn't know shit from Shinola,

and that the two of you aren't even talking to each other,

which I am getting a vibe of.

Now, I could care less,

but even the advance whispers of this local TV deal

have people so mad at you

that they're throwing piss at you on the street.

We don't know that it was actually piss.

It was piss.

You want to go on a shopping spree.

I trust you, but can we please fix the visuals?

This is a family business.

But the family is fucked,

and it's hurting the stock.

Whenever war has tested this nation,

we have won out.

And that is what I believe we face right now.

Nothing less than a war

against human inequality,

a war we must fight

to stop unimaginably vast power and riches

falling into the hands

of an impossibly small number of men.

I'm not afraid of this fight.

I know you're not either.

This fight starts here.

I'm Gil Eavis, and I approved this message.

I don't know, this class war shit,

don't you find it a little jejune?

- Jejune? - Yeah. It means juvenile.

Yeah, I... I know what it means.

I just thought only assholes said it.

- No, I do not find it jejune. - Is this you pulling my hair?

Because why did you bring me in for this? I'm not a good fit.

I genuinely believe he's gonna

be the next president of the United States.

And you know me, I don't believe in anything.

Are you finished with Joyce now?

Yeah. That's as far as she'll go.

OK. Gil could really use someone like you.

And this wouldn't be a problem?

What?

The atmosphere.

I think as long as we have clarity.

- Yeah. Right. Clarity. - Right.

And to be clear,

at absolutely any place at any time,

with absolutely no consequences,

I would fuck you,

and will want desperately to fuck you.

And that is just a permanent state of affairs.

I just want you to know that is my position.

You have all the power.

You can do whatever you want with it.

When did we start having to do this shit, Gerri?

The journalist is Leo Lorenzetti.

The piece will be, "After the turmoil, the coming together."

At your son's ranch.

A family, a dynasty,

an American story.

It'll be a very compelling package.

And what's this shit? Who's this guy Alon?

Very highly regarded corporate therapist.

Harvard Business School.

Former CFO at a Fortune 500.

He just worked with the Sultan of Brunei,

and the Bolkiah family.

Do they all have to be there?

Does the traitor come too?

Well, obviously, that's your choice.

But the message, I think,

is a family reunited in the desert.

A time to reflect, regroup.

Family unity is kind of what you're going for.

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.  - And frankly, Logan,

if you can get Kendall to drop the lawsuit,

everything becomes cleaner for us, acquisition-wise.

OK. Well, I'm not groveling.

Get Romulus on the phone.

Let's do the email.

Hey, Shiv.

It's Con. Listen, did you get this email from Dad

about therapy?

'Cause, I mean,

this is, like, wow!

So I just need to check that it's not

one of those spam things or something.

All right, so call me.

I like Gil... people like Gil, he's great...

but I have a sneaking feeling that if he won an election

he'd probably like to line me up and everyone I know and shoot us.

- Holy fuck. No way.  - What?

Hang on.

- Hey.  - Have you seen this?

I can't believe it. Dad's doing therapy?

I thought you weren't talking to me because

I didn't tell you about the vote.

I'm not. But what the fuck.

Very much the fuck.

Very much the fuck indeed.

The big man is breakin' down, and everyone's invited.

Well, not Kendall.

- Everybody.  - This is bullshit.

What's he doing?

- Gotta go. See ya. - Please, Mr. Roy...

- I need to talk to Kendall.  - He's not available.

What do you mean he's not available?

What is he doing, playing with his fucking Legos?

He's nothing but available.

He isn't here right now.

Well, I know that's not true,

so just come on, OK?

He hasn't been here for weeks.

- I'm sorry.  - Bullshit. OK, look,

will you just give him a message?

- No, thank you.  - Tell him...

"No, thank you" ...

Tell him to reply to the email,

that he has to come. OK?

Tell him that...

Hey. Dad wants...

Hey. Um, no.

No, I don't think he's gonna play ball.

He's not talking. No way he's gonna drop the lawsuit.

OK, that's fine, Roman.

- No?  - No.

OK. Plan B.

Operation Black Sheep.

- Hey.  - Hey. You OK?

Yeah, I'm fine. What's up?

Oh, what time are we doing the pickup?

Do you ever look at Sophie's Instagram?

I was monitoring,

and one of the older kids

linked to that shitty article about you.

What article?

I haven't been looking at anything. Deliberately, Rava.

"Kendall Roy ran the streets of New York,

sweaty and incoherent,

ranting about a coup against his father,

but couldn't find his way to the board room to start said coup.

Is he back on drugs?

We couldn't possibly say,

but some people are saying that."

Rava, listen to me.

OK, that's... That's not true.

- Yeah. - OK? That's not true.

It's just that's what you used to say

when it was true.

Jesus, I'm not using, Rava.

I... I don't touch anything.

And you know that. Jesus Christ. Come on.

But look, unrelated,

this weekend Iverson's got his tests

and if we break his routine, it's gonna affect things.

- You know?  - No. No.

Fuck, come on.

Please don't get angry.

I'm not... I'm not fucking angry.

OK? I want to see my kids.

I'm not on drugs, I'm not touching drugs,

I don't use drugs anymore, I'm not on drugs,

I'm not on fucking drugs.

Yeah, it's the paranoid rant that's so convincing.

Well, I actually think it's really brave to go.

Oh, thank you. I'm a hero.

Can you imagine?

Connor, Dad, Roman, feelings?

It's gonna be like tossing a bag of Uzis into the soft play area.

I know your dad doesn't believe

you didn't know what Kendall was up to,

and he spoke abominably to you.

And, um, just for context,

do you think it would be appropriate this weekend,

in a bridge-building way,

for me to be speaking to Logan, or no?

Just do what you think is right.

Yeah, sure. I got it. I just, you know,

I want to have your back,

and, uh, there's also my back,

and, you know, we're a beast with two backs.

I get it. You're your own guy.

I won't judge you.

Yeah, sure, I know that. I know that.

- Hi!  - Hey, Marcia!

- Hi!  - Hey, Dad!

Welcome to Austerlitz!

Thank you, thank you.

- Ah. It exists!  - Yeah.

Austerlitz? Was this the name when you bought it?

Oh, it was racially insensitive,

so he picked a new one.

Do you want me to show you inside?

Hi, Connor.

Hi, Karolina.

So, son, have you got somewhere for them to set up?

So you're also working?

Just a few folks doing photographs and stuff.

- Oh? Uh... - Chroniclers of everything.

Ok.

OK. You bet.

- Great place. Plenty of space. - Yeah.

This works.

Oh, good.

Hey! I see you!

- Hey! - Hey!

Hi!

Hello to the metropolitan elite!

Welcome to the real America.

Oh, man of the people.

The people who work on his ranch.

- Hi! - Let me hug you.

What do you think?

Wow. Yeah.

- It's brown. - Yeah, it is.

- Is that a church? - Yeah, that's the chapel.

We're gonna be in there tomorrow.

That chapel dates to 1878.

- Cool! - It's a chapel.

Do you think Dad will be able to cross the threshold?

Or will be spontaneously combust?

Good question.

Why don't you guys get settled in,

and then join us for cocktails this evening.

Randall owns the next ranch over.

I told him to pop in. Just wanted to say hi.

He's very big in pesticides.

Uh-huh. I don't need any.

Yeah, that's what everybody says.

Nah, I'm always ribbing him.

Did you know that three out of every hundred bunches of grapes

has over the legal limit of pesticides?

So you wash 'em.

You can't wash your colon, Mr. Poison.

Why, I oughta...

Smart guy, put 'em up!

He thinks she knew about the coup.

So Logan will talk to Shiv as long as she says "Sorry."

Well, I think that Shiv's position would be

that she's got nothing to be sorry for.

I mean, obviously she's sad,

you know, there's sadness.

We could offer that.

OK. The entertainment has arrived.

This is like a... like the first stages of an orgy.

Kind of exciting, but also super-awkward.

- There. I did it. - Did what?

I just iced your dad.

- Hey, Tom. - Hey.

Can I...

Uh, yeah, I'm not in charge of you.

But go get me a drink.

I'm joking.

So where's the actual head doctor guy?

I wouldn't know. No one tells me anything.

Well, hope he can cure your serious case of being a bitch.

Ow. Fuck.

Fuck you.

Bet Dad's gonna try and win at therapy.

Well, he hasn't done therapy with me yet. I'm an expert.

- Oh, yeah? - Oh, yeah.

This is what it looks like when you resolve all your issues.

- Uh-huh. - Mm-hmm.

My guy says that if Dad had had therapy,

I wouldn't need so much.

My guy's surprised I got through at all.

I'm not sure you did make it through at all.

I don't think.... dee-dee, dah-doo, bah-dee...

See, I will have you know I am very well-adjusted.

You... you're just good at hiding it.

- Mr. Parfit is here. - Thank you.

OK, Randall,

I hate to kick you out,

but I have word Elvis is in the building.

- OK. - I'll see ya, buddy.

I just want you to know

I think I'm going to reveal to him

that you sexually abused me as a child.

- Excuse me? - Yeah. You just would not stop.

You are one sick puppy.

You're the one who kept trying to fuck me.

Why would you say that? Stop saying that.

You don't really think that, do you?

No. I'm fuckin' with you.

The way you fucked me as a baby.

What is wrong with you? You're exasperating.

This one is threatening to tell the family

that I diddled him when he was a little kid.

Oh. Right. Did you?

No, of course not, Tom.

- Connor. - Oh. Hi.

Alon Parfit.

- Hey. Hi. - Nice to see you.

- Happy you're here. - You must be Broman.

Yes, I am. Broman.

- And Shiv. - Yeah.

- Hey. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you...?

This is Tom. Shiv's fiancé.

Not important. To the therapy.

- Uh, Con? - Come meet Dad.

Yeah, please.

- Hi. - Logan Roy.

- This is Marcia. - Nice to meet you.

And this is my girlfriend Willa.

- Nice to meet you. - Hi, Willa, how are you?

Right. Family. Um...

we're all gathered here in this beautiful home

because there are things to address,

and I believe we should... address them.

I think I explained all around

that we'll also have

a small celebration of our coming together,

with photographs, tomorrow.

Nothing fancy. Simple. Simple.

Anyway, without more ado, let me introduce to you,

Alon Parfit.

Hi, everyone.

I look forward to us all sitting down tomorrow,

but I just want to say it takes a lot of courage,

and that is not lost on me.

I'm very touched.

- Yeah, me too. - Thanks.

This family's broken, and that has consequences.

A missed phone call today,

a couple dozen kids lose their jobs in China.

Butterfly wings, but bigger.

Huge wings. Like a pterodactyl.

Or the Smithsonian.

So... let's fix our wings.

Barely comprehensible.

Morning.

It is gassed up and ready to go.

- Your key. - Thank you.

Big plans while you're here?

Maybe.

Patricide? Fratricide?

OK. Sounds like fun.

- Enjoy. - Oh, yeah.

- Yeah? - Good morning.

We're here. You ready to do this?

What?

- No, wait. Now? - No shit.

I'm in a hotel in Santa Fe.

Well, I c-can't now.

I mean, the whole reason

I came down here is to do this family thing,

and that's today. So...

So?

Can he reschedule?

He's pretty fuckin' busy.

Fuck.

Doesn't look good, turning him down.

Well, obviously I want to...

Come on, Shiv, this is huge.

- But I can't. Right now. - Hey, honey,

the pressure on the faucet's moderately intense, so go easy.

- I gotta go. - Shiv...

Fuck.

Hey, it's gonna be OK.

It's going to be OK.

Want me to come in there with you?

Into the emotional swamp? Huh?

Pretty soon I'm gonna be part of this whole genetic carnival.

- It's OK. - You sure?

Yeah.

Morning.

OK. Let's do this.

The therapy? This way for the therapy.

Like waving your kids off to school.

They better not gang up on him.

He's still frail.

Roll up, roll up,

for the festival of grievances.

- OK, son? - Yeah. -Good.

OK. Great.

So, welcome, welcome.

I like to begin these things with a little prayer.

They fuck you up, your mom and dad.

They do not mean to, but they do.

They fill you up with faults they had

and add some extra just for you.

Now, I always think that's an interesting way

to start these things,

but what I'd like to know is,

how you feel you would like to start this.

So...

who's going to tell us why we are here today?

Come on. Does no one want to take a pop at the champ?

- Can I just say... - Sure.

I never touched Roman inappropriately.

If he says I did, I didn't.

Glad to clear that up.

He was gonna make a horrible joke, so I'm preempting.

Ok. Ok.

But I think the best way to start this...

I'll start if you'd like.

Yeah, Please.

Everything I've done in my life,

I've done for my children.

I know I've made mistakes,

but,

but I've always tried to do the best by them...

because... they mean everything to me.

OK. That was great.

Thank you.

- Well, that's nice. - It is nice.

Yeah, sure. Agreed.

So, what do we feel about what we just heard here?

I mean, I hear it.

I hear it.

Big words.

Good words.

I'm still... processing,

but yeah.

Logan, do you realize how much power you wield in this room?

What do you mean?

He has a lot of power everywhere.

Okay, what I guess I'm asking is,

how do you feel about what you just said?

Look, everything I've done in my life

I've done for my children.

- I know I've made mistakes... - Dad,

you can't just use the one sentence.

But that's how I feel, Siobhan.

I can make this shit up if you like.

Sounds like you already are.

- Shiv? - Look, I'm...

I guess where I'm coming from is

I'm having a hard time diving in because

honestly, I'm wondering why he brought us here in the first place.

I mean, was it for this photo opportunity?

No, no, of course not.

I wouldn't have brought you here for a photo and an interview...

Sorry. Excuse me? There's an interview now?

- Well, I told you, photo and... - No, you didn't.

What, so this is essentially a publicity event?

It's optional. There won't be questions.

This is not OK.

I have a publicist for this stuff.

Fuck. Con, did you know about this?

I think the picture is OK.

I think it's nice.

Rome?

I don't mind.

Logan, have you thought about the possibility

that your children are actually scared of you?

Fuck off.

After what they've done to me? Fuck off!

Tell me, do you think you'll always do what you do?

What, the theater?

Yes, and what you do for money.

Well, you know, I like my life,

and kind of just go with the flow,

so yeah, I think I'll just slide more over

into producing or writing or directing.

I knew a woman in Paris, she did what you do.

She was very intelligent.

Thank you.

And do you want children?

I don't know. Maybe one day.

Don't wait. That's all I will say.

The old biological clock starts a-ticking.

You could always freeze.

That's a way of putting off life.

I'd like Shiv to freeze. Embryos, not eggs.

A little bit of me in the bank.

Thought about that?

So much advice!

You know, my friend from Paris who was your way?

She actually was murdered.

It was nothing to do with her being a prostitute,

it was to do with a restaurant that went poof!

What?

Hey, do you have any non-alcoholic beer?

No. Sorry.

OK. How about sparkling water?

You a tourist?

Kind of.

Fancy.

Kendall Roy?

You here visiting family?

Connor Roy?

What?

No, it's OK, I probably think the same.

- Yeah. There's just stories. - Like?

Like, he came in here one night,

he had this dog with cancer that he couldn't let the vet kill

but he couldn't watch it die either,

so he dragged that thing around the whole bar

asking somebody if they'd take it and give it a good life.

He said, "I'll pay you. I just can't watch."

Anyway, Skunkhead Tanner over there

took three grand, shot her in the parking lot.

Jesus.

- What? - None of your business.

I was talking about Skunkhead.

Don't talk shit about me, Janelle.

Really?

Hey, also, can I get a double Smirnoff rocks?

- Lime? - No.

Keep it open.

Heard you killed my brother's dog.

Look, can we go back to our agreement

where we put aside our cell phones,

just focus on what's going on this room?

Can we do that?

I'm trying to buy a number of television stations.

OK, but could you do it later?

Fine. Tell me what more you want and I'll dance the dance.

I guess what I want is for you to tell us

how you are feeling?

How I'm feeling?

I feel...

I need to check my emails.

That's not a feeling, Dad.

Maybe don't deny Dad's feelings, Shiv.

OK, I turned down something huge to be here,

and you're gonna tank it.

- I'm doing therapy. - I don't think you are.

I am.

Now you're denying their feelings, Dad.

Look, what I think we should really have a conversation about

is the fact that Kendall's not here.

And that's because there are reports of him

running around taking drugs.

And I, for one, don't know where those have come from.

You don't have to worry about that.

What does that mean?

I'm not getting into that today. It's beyond the remit.

I don't really think there is a remit, Dad.

I had nothin' to do with those stories.

Shiv, do you believe your father?

- Well... - Go on.

Honestly, no.

I think this whole thing is fake.

Roman?

I don't know.

I don't know.

- No. - I mean,

he might not have meant to, but...

- no, I don't believe him. - I'm sorry!

I'm sorry!

All right?!

I'm finished.

I'll apologize as much as you fuckin' like,

but I can't get into everything.

That's it.

You know, Logan,

if I'm asked if I thought

that you participated in this family therapy in an earnest way,

I don't think that I could answer in good conscience

that you have.

Fine. I apologize.

Maybe I'm hungry.

I got nothin' to hide.

Ok.

How about we take a break

and begin again, clean slate, this afternoon?

So come on, come on, tell me.

What did everybody say in there?

Was it nothing too horrible or upsetting?

Was it just disgusting?

Hey, I'm gonna go down to Santa Fe to meet Gil.

What? So everything has been resolved in there?

Yeah. Totally.

We're all completely sane. All resolved.

Come on.

- Can I take a car? - What's up?

- Wait. What are you doing? - The Tesla.

I'm going into town. I've got a meeting.

I'm not gonna take this seriously if no one else is.

But we're getting somewhere, Shiv.

I can feel it. He's breaking down.

You're sweet and I love you, but you're delusional.

Well, you can't do that. Is that allowed?

Well, I think Shiv is capable of making an adult decision.

But here's what I was thinkin'.

Why don't we all take a break?

Just get out of our heads and into our good bodies.

You know? Let's go for a swim.

Everybody. You know? Get your dad out there.

- Dad can't swim. - Yeah.

He doesn't even trust water.

It's too wishy-washy.

Can I have the keys?

- Thank you. - Seriously?

Yeah.

- Hey, Willa. - Yeah?

Hey, honey,

do you know about the family photo for later?

Yeah, it'll be nice.

Yeah, well,

there was an idea that maybe you should sit it out.

I'm sorry.

No, no, it's OK. I'll probably end up getting murdered anyway.

Nobody's murdering you.

You're adorable.

You're unmurderable.

Look, you know...

You know I appreciate you.

I appreciate you, too.

And I think you're better than all of them.

Th-Thank you.

Look, I know that we talked about this before,

but I was just wondering

if you could...

well, would you...

I don't know how to say this,

except to say that love is a strange and peculiar affliction.

It's-- It's like a virus.

So could you please just stay here for a while...

- and maybe you'll catch it. - Con.

What I mean is that you would have an allowance

and you would continue to write

and you continue to travel to New York,

and I would help you build a life in the theater.

Gosh, that's a lot.

Yeah, but we have so many great ideas.

Yeah. Sure. No, we do.

So we could do family, but we could do it different.

I mean...

we could try.

Exactly! Why not? Yeah?

Yeah!

- Yeah? - Yeah.

Hey, I love you.

And... I, um...

I love you.

See? That wasn't so hard, was it?

OK. Lot of wolf stuff.

Yeah, man, I love the wolves.

- He really likes the wolves. - Yeah. Cool.

My mom says I was a wolf child.

That's 'cause she never bothered to take care of you, Chang.

That's just fuckin' salesmanship of her neglect.

Nice.

- You get wolves here? - Nope.

- No? OK. - Fuckin' wish.

I never did meth.

And I'm technically sober,

so this is kind of an experiment.

There we go.

There's a thing now that Type A's actually can't get addicted.

Ya know? 'Cause we are addicted.

You know, if it wasn't for wolves, we couldn't speak.

It's from having to tell dogs what to do

that we actually had a need to talk out loud,

you know, to command 'em?

You guys, come on. We got a real person.

Let's not attack his brain.

We should get some more.

- Fuck, yeah. - Yeah?

And, uh, maybe some weed.

- Right. - Some Oxys, some...

some goodies.

So, you like it?

Experiment successful.

I am interested in becoming a meth head.

Yeah.

Well, we're the fuckin' right people, dude!

- Hey. - Hi. You comin' in?

- Oh, yeah. - Good.

Don't be afraid of what's down there.

Pretend it's our subconscious and just go for it.

I know how to dive.

Yeah, you gotta jump.

- You want me to jump? - Jump! Jump! Jump!

- Jump, ya fuckin' pussy! - Jump! Jump! Jump!

Excuse me, there's been an accident in the pool.

What did he say?

An accident in the pool.

We don't know if he got a head injury, or...

He just dived in and he hit the bottom.

Did you hit your head?

- He hit his teeth? - His teeth are in his head,

Connor, it's kind of a central feature.

It's clearly signed. What were you thinking?

Shall I call an ambulance?

I didn't think he'd jump in headfirst. Hi, Karolina.

Hey, Roman. Don't let him go to sleep.

I don't want to go to fuckin' sleep!

Let's take a look. The bleeding always

makes it look worse than it actually...

Jesus Christ!

Let's take him to the hospital.

- Really? - No, you're OK, man.

It's OK. You look OK.

It'll be faster if I just take him myself.

No, no, no, send your guys. Send Colin.

- We should stay. - No, I want to help him ou...

I want to make sure he's not litigious.

Fuckin' great! And I was about to take advice from a clown

who dives headfirst into the shallow end of the pool!

And now everyone's fucking off!

It's OK. I got you.

Roman is here.

He's here for the photos, for everything.

- Sure. I give good cheekbone. - OK.

Gil.

Siobhan Roy.

The acceptable face of the worst family in America.

Yeah. Gil Eavis. Stalin in a plaid shirt.

OK. Well, happy meeting.

So... how are you?

Really?

Well, my family's fucked.

I'm not talking about to my dad, and my brother's suing my dad.

Sorry. If family isn't right, nothing feels right.

Yeah. And how are you?

You gonna go for it?

I'm feeling really good.

Suffered some depression last year after everything,

but, um... I'm good.

And so, what, you want me to handle the message on that?

No. That's just the truth.

Look, Siobhan,

I'm not gonna make you do a dance.

I'm finalizing. Nate and me want you on the team.

What do you think?

Well, I think you're too radical.

I'm not telling you anything you don't know.

The good politician, he figures out what people need

and then he sells it back to them as what they want.

So... this is a job offer?

Well, yes.

But there's an issue.

What, my name?

One section of my base would

be outraged for me even meeting with you.

Yeah, well, that section has nowhere else to go, so fuck 'em.

Yeah.

Look, if I'm gonna win big the way I want to,

to remake this country for the better...

Ooh! La-dee-dah.

I need to spike your father's guns.

The papers, the news channels.

I can't help with that.

No, no, no, of course. Of course.

But I'm gonna go for his throat.

Legally, legislatively,

hearings, referrals.

I thought I should tell you.

It'll be ugly.

And how do you know that I won't betray you?

Well, I guess I trust you.

I can work with Nate, but I can't work for Nate.

It's fine, it's just a... it's a preposition thing.

We can figure all that out.

The bigger question is,

do you want this enough to go to war with your family?

Can we do the walking and talking?

- What? - Walking and talking.

He wants us to be talking.

- That looks good. - Thank you.

We look great, apparently.

I want you to call Japan.

We got the office set up here.

I'm tickling Sandy on local.

I want you to get into the government issues

- of the launch detail. - Right. Sure.

Do you actually want me to do that, or are you just

- saying shit for the camera? - No.

You're a COO, aren't you?

- Huh? - Yeah.

- Well? - Sure. I got it.

I mean, I was just checking.

Thank you, gentlemen.

That's really grand.

- Yeah? - This looks imperial here.

- Thank you. - Thank you very much.

- Did he say "Imperial"? - Imperial.

What the hell does that mean?

Yeah, he's good.

- Yes. - Yeah.

So?

I don't...

I don't know.

I...

Ok.

- ok? - ok.

Right?

Fuck, yes.

I mean, I told him that he would have to fire you

if he was gonna hire me, but...

- It's fine. - OK.

- For the good of the country. - Right.

My Airbnb has a, um...

memory foam mattress.

How 'bout we...

give it some... memories?

Turn it off.

Turn it off.

Let's just...

sit here a minute and...

so I can think.

He sees Oprah walkin' down the street,

he's like, "Oprah, you get a car. You get a car."

He's so rich he needs a golf cart to pass the salt.

He's so rich his goldfish wear furs.

Yeah, yeah, fish fur.

He's so rich that his sperm has little top hats

and monocles and shit.

Yeah. "Good day, vagina.

May I enter thou?"

You know, I don't even care that you're richer than us.

I mean, who's better off, ultimately?

I mean, clearly, you are, but... fuck it, who cares?

I do.

Guys, I gotta make a quick call.

- Yeah, go for it. - Yeah.

- Uh, hey. - Bro.

I've got a lot of important information in play.

- What? Where are you? - I'm in New Mexico.

- What? - I realize now.

Are you high?

No. I'm at some guy's house.

I mean, yeah, we been taking drugs,

but I'm very clear.

Uh, can you drop me a pin so I know you're OK?

We're OK. There... That's nothing wrong with us.

Just drop me a fucking pin. I'm not gonna come get you.

Do it now. Are you doing it?

Yeah, OK. Hold on.

Here ya go.

OK. I'm comin' to get you, man.

Are you doing the call?

Uh, yeah, uh, yes. I will.

But, um, I'm going to get Kendall.

He's here, and he's not great.

OK, go. Go. Go.

Yeah, OK. But no, I will. I'll make the call.

Who the fuck is that?

Kendall.

- Who the fuck is that? - It's cool, it's my brother.

It's cool. Let him in.

Jesus. Fuck.

Chang. Let him in, man.

Thank you.

Gonna offer me a cup of tea?

I like what you've done with the wolves.

Yo, Chang, show him... show him your wolf tattoo.

Do the howl, Chang.

Wow. Funny and cool.

Yo. This is Chang, Tanner,

that's Mac.

So great to meet you guys.

Let's get outta here. Come on.

You know, I was thinking I probably shouldn't talk to you

given the ongoing situation

apropos of my legal action against you

as a board member for your failure to fulfill your fiduciary duty

and breaching my employment contract,

but then, I don't know, but then I thought, "Who fucking cares?"

What... Is this...

What is this?

What is this, fuckin' crank?

We've been having a lot of fun, Mom.

Yeah. That's good.

Yo, seriously. You should try this.

I would love to, some other time.

I hear that shit makes you crash like an airbus full of eggs.

Not if you stay high.

Tanner makes good points.

I think this lighter is fucked.

That is a really good point.

You know what? Let's get the fuck out of here.

Come on.

That's enough. I can fix that. Here.

how's the family therapy?

Oh, the therapy? It was total bullshit.

He didn't even do it.

- He didn't do it? - No. He didn't.

- Come on. - I'm coming. Let's do it.

Hey, man, your friend sucks.

- That's my brother. - Your brother sucks.

He's actually... You know what?

- He's OK. - Thanks.

Our people will reach out to your people.

Hey, Kendall! Tell Bill Gates

my computer's fucked up from all the fuckin' updates, man!

You OK?

Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

Should I call a doctor? Rava?

You want me to hit a kid so I can steal his kidneys?

Fuck. I'm sorry.

I have to make a call. It's the...

It's the launch in Japan thing.

Um, is that cool?

It's OK.

You do your call.

Ok.

No. No Lion King.

Yeah, could you...

Sorry.

What, are you fuckin' four? Will ya knock it off?

I'm trying to drive the car

and not have a-weema-weh in my fucking face.

- ♪ The mighty jungle ♪ - That's enough!

♪ The lion sleeps... ♪

You're late.

So, what happened with the fake therapy?

Any pretend breakthroughs? Any good performances?

Nothing. Our therapist died.

- What? - Metaphorically speaking.

He smashed his teeth out in the pool.

Oh, my God.

Freud would have had a field day.

Where you been?

I was meeting about a prospective job.

With your father's enemy?

OK, I'm gonna go to bed.

I keep an eye on things, Siobhan.

I keep an eye.

What is that supposed to mean?

I mean, I had a meeting.

You do whatever the hell you like, on everything, forever

Why don't we chat this over in the morning?

And he has to hear it from his so-called friends,

on the phone, dripping poison in his ear.

Fami-ly therapy!

Kenny.

Fami-ly therapy!

Fami-ly therapy!

What up, motherfuckers!

Sorry I'm late. What are we arguing about?

- What's wrong with him? - Oh, where do we start?

I'm off my nut, folks.

Off my fuckin' nut.

Like all the papers said.

Your dreams have come true. Congratulations.

Just so you know, I think things are good with the launch.

- I talked to the guy... - He doesn't care, Rome.

He doesn't even fuckin' notice.

Dad, give him a high five.

Come on. He's waiting. Dad?

You'd do that to me? Eavis.

The one senate member who wants to fuck me ragged.

On the same side as those animals

that hit me with a bag of piss.

It's my work, Dad. You of all people ought to understand that.

Work?! It's rebellion! Sabotage!

Yeah, of course, cause it's all about you.

Not that I might be in

agreement with his points about the purchases,

or just maybe his whole philosophy.

Philosophy?

This is nothing but a miserable deliberate attempt

to undermine my whole business strategy.

You don't have a business strategy, Dad.

Your whole business model is based on seducing presidents.

You're a really high-class hooker.

No offense.

Fuck off.

It's fine. My aunt's an addict.

It's been a long day. It's been really nice

getting to know you all a bit better.

- Good night. - Good night.

I gotta say I feel a little bit used today, Pa.

Oh, for fuck's sake. Not you too.

Where we are and all that's happened,

and then even tonight you have to go off and work?

I made some calls. Jesus. Can't you wait?

Can I wait for you to finish a few calls?

Yeah, I think so, Pa. I've had a bit of practice.

- Connor. - Quite a bit.

Connor, your father has been busy

dealing with these two traitors.

Disagreeing with Dad is not treason.

But trying to make one of his

biggest enemies president is kind of a "Fuck you."

Oh, hey, Dad. Dad.

I like those stories you planted about me.

That was...

- Yes. You forced my hand. - There it is.

Yes! And he's fuckin' lucky that was all.

What you kids do not understand,

it's all part of the game.

Oh, it's all part of the game.

Come on, everybody.

It's a rootin'-tooti'' super fuckin' fun game

for all the family!

Step right up!

You run towards politics to prove that you're your own man.

Fine. But that's not principle.

You're scared to compete.

You're marrying a man fathoms beneath you

because you don't want to risk being betrayed.

You're a fucking coward.

Wow, you are just beyond.

You know... I was born lucky.

I'm a lucky person.

I realize that.

And you're so fuckin' jealous, aren't you?

You're so fuckin' jealous of what you've given your own kids.

You can't handle it.

You c... You can't work it out.

If I had spoken to my uncle like that...

What? Hmm? What would evil Uncle Noah do?

Calling your daughter a coward till she cries?

- Big man. - Logan. Logan. Logan.

Logan. Logan!

You are a fucking nobody.

Fuckin' nobody.

- As always. - Good to see you.

I'm sorry. You know.

No. It's fine.

you know, it wasn't great.

But you had some fun, right?

- Yeah. - You had some fun here?

- OK. You come back and see me? - Yeah.

- It was really fun. - Buddy, I'm sorry.

- No, don't. - It was just such a drag.

No, no. It was good fun.

- You had some fun, right? - Yeah, absolutely.

- All right, bye. - OK. Bye.

-Bye-bye. - Call me.

It's funny, I wanted 'em all here.

But I feel relieved they're starting to go.

It'll be nicer when it's just us.

How far is it to a Starbucks?

- I have pods. - OK. Great.

That's it. There you go.
