.a stupid number
*这里的“stupid”不是指数字本身智力低下，而是指这个数字大到令人难以置信，不合常理，甚至有点愚蠢或可笑。它通常带有负面含义，表示过高、过分。*


====

What's a stupid number?
[.my2]
多大算大


What's stupid? A "badillion"? I don't know.
[.my2]
多大 数兆亿吗 谁知道


[.my1]
.案例
====
.badillion
“badillion” 不是一个标准英语词汇，它是一个由说话者（可能是在玩笑或夸张的语境下）创造出来的词，用来表示一个“极其巨大、数不清的数字”。

它的构成可能是： +
*"bad"（坏的，不好的，或在这里强调“过分”、“巨大”的程度）* +
"-illion"（一个后缀，常用于表示巨大数字的词，例如：million 百万, billion 十亿, trillion 万亿）。

所以，“badillion”可以理解为**“一个坏到离谱的亿万级数字”，或者“一个多得无法计算、糟糕透顶的数字”**。它用来表达说话者对某个数字（在这里是120）觉得已经很高，但又无法具体说出多高才算“stupid number”时的一种夸张和无奈。

Bit of content 少量内容资产 and a brand name 品牌名称?

_Bit of content_  and _a brand name_ *kinda's* (= kind of is *差不多是*) the whole game 这个行业的本质.
[.my2]
内容和品牌名字, 不就是这行的全部吗？(回应前一句，暗示“媒体行业就是靠内容和品牌吃饭”。)


[.my1]
.案例
====
.kinda's
"kinda" = "kind of" 的口语缩略（类似 "sorta" = sort of）。 +
"'s" = "is" 的缩写（口语中常见，如 "that's" = that is）。 +
合并效果："kinda's" = "kind of is"（“差不多是”）。 +

#*"kind of" 作为副词, 修饰系动词 "is"，表示“某种程度上是”或“基本算是”。*#

正式写作中应写为 "kind of is"，但口语/非正式文本中可缩写成 "kinda's"。

-That kind of is the point. => 	That #kinda's# the point.	“差不多就是这个意思。”
-He kind of is a genius.	=> He #kinda's# a genius.	“他算是个天才吧。”

为什么用 "kinda's" 而不用 "is"？

-原句若用 "is"：
"A bit of content and a brand name is the whole game."
→ 显得过于绝对（断言“这就是全部”）。
-用 "kinda's"：
→ 添加不确定性，暗示“虽然听起来简单，但事实如此”。

当你想表达 「获得, 享有他人没有的权利/机会」 时： +
积极语境："I got to meet the president!"（强调难得机会） +

====

Well, thanks, buddy.
[.my2]
谢了 老哥




[.my1]
.案例
====

潜台词："你的评价对我毫无意义" +
"well"拉长音+停顿，表达「懒得和你计较」

可以套用这个模板：
对方挑衅 → 你夸张自嘲 → 对方假夸 → 你虚假感谢

例如：当有人说"Lawyer must be soul-crushing" (律师一定是令人心碎的) 时，可以回："Totally! I drown my sorrows /in client's tears and cocaine." (完全!我用客户的眼泪和可卡因, 来淹没我的悲伤。)

这种对话的精髓在于：用最灿烂的笑容，说最黑暗的实话.

====

-Hi.  -Oh, what is that?
[.my2]
-好  -这什么味儿 +

哦，你喷了什么香水？

_Date Rape_ by Calvin Klein (美国时装品牌)?

关于估计： +
A: "I thought you'd finish in an hour, but it took seventy minutes." （“我以为你一小时能做完，结果花了70分钟。”）

[.my2]
这个档口事情太多


[.my1]
.案例
====
“It’s *just as* 正因为,由于 this all goes through” 这个部分。这是一个非常口语化的表达，在书面语中不太常见。 +
“*正因为所有这些事都挤在一起了…”* 或 “*情况是这样的，所有这些安排都正好赶在一块儿了…*”

“just as” 在这里不表示“正当…时”（时间点），而是**表示 “正因为”、“由于”，用来强调因果关系。**类似于 “The reason is that...”。

“this all” 指的是说话人和听话人都心知肚明的一系列事情（比如，几个不同的计划、项目、预约等）。

“goes through” 在这里是一个短语动词的生动用法。它的核心意象是“通过”或“完成”，在**这里引申为 “（一系列事件）正在发生、正在推进、都赶到这个时间点上了”。
可以想象一个管道，很多事情（this all）正同时通过（go through）这个时间节点。**


你可以用以下更简单的说法来替换，意思基本不变： +
“With everything happening at once...” （所有事都赶一块儿了…） +
“Because all of this is happening at the same time...” （因为所有这些事都在同时发生…） +
“The thing is, all these things are coming together...” （问题是，所有事都凑到一起了…） +
“Since we’ve got all this going on...” （既然我们手头有这么多事要处理…） +

I'm going *to add* Marcy *to* _myself and you four_.
[.my2]
我要让玛西取代我 和你们四个一道


Whoa. OK.
[.my2]
是吗


And my seat also to go to her /on my death.
[.my2]
并且，在我去世后，我在（公司）董事会的位置也将留给她。


[.my1]
.案例
====
这里的 “seat” 不是一个物理上的椅子，而是一个比喻，指的是一个职位，特别是在董事会中的席位 和相应的投票权。

这段对话描绘了一个家庭在讨论家族信托和公司控制权的安排： +
背景： *父亲（Dad）正在修改“家族信托”的条款。家族信托通常用于持有家族财富（如公司股份、房产等）, 并规定继承规则。* +

第一项安排： “I’m going to add Marcy to myself and you four.” +
这意味着，*目前信托的受益人或决策者, 包括父亲自己和其他四个人。现在他要把 Marcy 也加进去，让她成为其中一员。* +

第二项安排（即你的问题）： “And my seat also to go to her on my death.” +
这指的是父亲在家族公司董事会中的职位。*作为公司创始人或重要股东，他拥有一个董事会席位，这个席位附带着投票权。* +
*“on my death” 表明这是一个遗产规划：当他去世时，他的董事会席位将直接由 Marcy 继承。* +

其他人的反应： “What? Wait, that gives her double voting weight.” +
这个反应证实了我们的解读。*为什么是“双倍投票权”？ +
第一重权力： 通过被加入家族信托，Marcy 在信托事务的决策中, 可能已经拥有了一票投票权。 +
第二重权力： 通过继承父亲的董事会席位，她在公司董事会的决策中, 又获得了一票投票权。* +
因此，她一个人就拥有了来自两个不同来源（信托和董事会）的投票权，影响力大增，所以其他家庭成员会感到惊讶和担忧。 +
====

What? Wait, that gives her double _voting weight_ 投票权重.
[.my2]
什么 等下 这就给了她双份投票权了

[.my2]
我听说你当时(谈判中)表现得很软弱，显得回避冲突。

[.my1]
.案例
====
"I hear it played weak."：这里的 "it" 指的是对方在之前提到的那次事件中的行为表现。"Played" 在这里是“表现”、“应对”的意思（类似于在某种情境下“扮演”的角色或采取的方式）。"Played weak" 就是一个很地道的说法，意思是 “（你的）应对方式显得软弱/怯懦”。

**"Conflict averse."：这是一个常见的心理学术语/形容词，意思是 “回避冲突的” 或 “不愿与人起争执的”。**说话者用这个词来总结和强调对方“表现软弱”的具体性质——即因为害怕或不愿意发生冲突而选择了退让。

You know, *this has been floated* already?
[.my2]
你知道局势已经漂浮不定了吗


[.my1]
.案例
====
这句话的意思是：*“你知道吧，这个想法/消息早就被放出去试探风声了？”* +
这里的关键是动词 #*“float”。在商业、政治或媒体语境中，它不表示“漂浮”，而是一个比喻性的说法，意思是： +
（像试飞气球一样）试探性地提出：故意将一个想法、计划或消息非正式地泄露给媒体或一个小圈子，目的不是为了正式宣布，而是为了观察公众或相关人员的反应。如果反应好，就推进；如果反应差，就否认或放弃。这是一种常见的公关或谈判策略。*# +

所以，“this has been floated already” 表明关于某个话题的传闻已经有人在背后散播，已经不是秘密了。 +
====

There's fucking paps 狗仔队 outside. *I'm getting asked* for quotes 引用，引述;开价，报价.
[.my2]
外面什么样的说法都有 总有人来找我证实

[.my1]
.案例
====
这句话的意思是：“他妈的都有狗仔在外面了！都已经有人来问我要求置评了！” +
这句話是用来强调第一句话的严重性，说明消息不仅被“floated”了，而且已经引发了真正的媒体关注。 +

paps：是 paparazzi（狗仔队） 的简写和俗称，指那些追逐名人的摄影记者。 +
fucking：粗口，用于加强语气，表达说话人的愤怒、厌烦和压力。 +
**getting asked for quotes：“被要求发表评论”。**当媒体得知一个可能成为新闻的事件时，他们会联系相关人士寻求官方或非官方的表态，这就是“ask for a quote”。 +
====

他举了另一个例子（可能指一个叫“Network”的电视网或节目）。起初也没人看好，“但只要你给它注入活力（zing），人们就会看。”


except you give it zing 活力；生命力；精力 /and they do.
[.my2]
除非你来点刺激的 他们就乐意看了 +
“Zing” 是关键，指活力、吸引力、令人兴奋的特质。


You make your own reality.
[.my2]
创造你自己的现实吧

[.my1]
.案例
====
这是全段的中心论点。他不相信存在一个既定不变的“现实”或“趋势”去被动适应。他认为，强者和成功者能够通过意志、行动和远见主动创造属于自己的现实和趋势。这是一种极度自信和拥有强大自我效能的体现。
====


And once you've done it, apparently, **everybody's `表` of the opinion**_ 持有……的看法 后定说明 _it was **all so fucking obvious**_.
[.my2]
而一旦你成功了，显然，所有人都会觉得你成功的道理 他妈的是如此显而易见。(人人都是事后诸葛亮)

[.my1]
.案例
====
主干： Everybody | is | of the opinion ... +
主语 (Subject): Everybody（每个人） +
系动词 (Linking Verb): is（是） +
表语 (Predicative): of the opinion ...（持有……的看法）

“of the opinion” 是一个介词短语，意思是“持有……的观点/看法”。这个观点具体是什么，需要由一个从句来说明，这个从句就是 “(that) it was all so fucking obvious”。

在非常正式的书写作文中，我们会在 “of the opinion” 后面加上连接词 “that”，引导一个同位语从句，用来解释 “opinion” 的具体内容。 +
正式写法：... of the opinion *that* it was all so fucking obvious. +
##**在口语中，这个 “that” 经常被省略，**##所以台词里直接就是 ... of the opinion it was all so fucking obvious。这是一种非常常见的口语现象。


同位语从句的内部结构： (that) it | was | all so fucking obvious
这个从句本身也是一个主系表结构。 +
主语 (Subject): it（这个“它”是形式主语，指代前文提到的“他成功”这件事） +
系动词 (Linking Verb): was（是） +
表语 (Predicative): all so fucking obvious（全部如此显而易见） +


即: +
句子主干： +
Everybody(主语) + is(系动词) + of the opinion(表语). +

表语部分的扩展： +
of the opinion+ [(that)+ it(从句主语) + was(从句系动词) + all so fucking obvious(从句表语)].

每个人都持有这样一种看法：（认为）这一切（指他成功这件事）他妈的都是如此显而易见（是理所当然的）。

So, let's *raise a toast* (祝酒，敬酒) 举杯祝酒.
[.my2]
那么 举杯吧

[.my1]
.案例
====
"toast"（祝酒）和"toast"（烤面包）这两个意思之间的联系，确实源于一个共同的单词。 +
这个单词就是：拉丁语 "tostus"。 +

下面为您梳理这个词义的演变脉络，这其实是一个非常生动的故事： +
词义演变的桥梁：热量 +
**源头：拉丁语 "torrēre"（烤，炙烤） +
这个词的过去分词是 "tostus"，意思是“被烤干的”或“被烘烤过的”。**这个词进入了古法语，成为 "toster"（动词，烘烤），然后传入英语，成为 "toasten"。 +

第一个意思：烤面包片 +
这是最直接的含义。**将面包片加热烘烤，使其变脆、变色，就成了"toast"。**这个意思至今仍是我们最熟悉的。 +

关键的桥梁：放入酒杯的烤面包片（约17世纪） +
这是两个意思产生联系的直接原因。 +
*在伊丽莎白时期的英格兰，有一种流行的饮酒习俗：人们会在葡萄酒或啤酒杯里放入一片加香料的烤面包。 +
目的之一：调味：面包可以吸收酒中的沉淀物，改善酒的口感和风味。 +
目的之二：致敬：更重要的是，这成为一种向某人致敬的方式。酒杯在席间传递，每个人都会喝一口。当酒杯传到主人或贵宾手中时，他可以把杯中的那片面包吃掉，以示接受并回敬大家的敬意。 +*

意义的转移：从“物”到“行为” +
随着时间的推移，"toast" 一词的含义发生了巧妙的转移： +
*最初，人们会说："Let's drink to the toast."（让我们为这片“面包”干杯。）这里的"toast"指杯中的实物。 +
后来，重点从“杯中的面包”转移到了“被敬酒的人或事”。人们开始说："He is the toast of the town."（他是城里的风云人物/大家敬酒的对象。）* +
最终，"toast" 本身就直接代表了“祝酒”这个行为。所以，"propose a toast" 就是“提议祝酒”，"raise a toast" 就是“举杯祝酒”。 +

总结
所以，"toast" 的两个意思并非偶然同音，而是有着直接的历史渊源： +
烘烤 (toast) -> 烤面包片 (toast) -> 被放入酒杯中用于敬酒的面包片 -> 敬酒的对象 -> 祝酒的行为 (toast) +
用一个单词来概括这个桥梁，就是其词源 "tostus"（被烘烤的）。但如果要用一个概念来解释，那就是 *“放入酒杯中的烤面包片” 这个已经消失的习俗，完美地将“烤”和“酒”联系在了一起。 +*

I was just talking to my grandpa.
[.my2]
我跟我祖父通了话


And he said happy birthday.
[.my2]
他跟你说生日快乐


Did he?
[.my2]
他说了吗


Well, no, not technically,
[.my2]
好吧 理论上 他没说


but he's aware it's your birthday.
[.my2]
但他知道你过生日


But it occurred to me, talking to him,
[.my2]
但跟他通话后 我突然想到


that him having his seat on the holding company still,
[.my2]
他仍在控股公司有席位


from historically,
[.my2]
这是历史遗留问题


now, that must be suboptimal, in some ways.
[.my2]
某种程度上讲 他不是最佳人选


But if I could... if he was willing to give his seat
[.my2]
但如果我可以... 如果他愿意把这个位置


to someone a bit more perspicacious,
[.my2]
让更精明的人来接替


someone who could learn the ropes, running a theme park, say.
[.my2]
让更熟悉门道的人来运营这些主题公园


Running the parks?
[.my2]
运营这些游乐场


Just a little guy. Learning, you know?
[.my2]
交给年轻人 不断学习


I mean, could that be...?
[.my2]
那个人选...


You scratch my back, I...
[.my2]
你要是帮我 我...


I'm not gonna say I could scratch yours.
[.my2]
虽说我并不能回报你什么


It's be too considerable of a space.
[.my2]
因为这个范围太大了


But is there an angle there, perhaps?
[.my2]
但... 也许你能考虑下


So... what're you thinking, son?
[.my2]
儿子 你什么想法


On the thing?
[.my2]
对于这件事


She's very smart.
[.my2]
她很聪明


She'd make good picks. Family first.
[.my2]
她是很好的人选 家人优先


I'm sure. I'm sure.
[.my2]
我懂 我懂的


But what's your cut?
[.my2]
那你为什么不高兴


Um... No.
[.my2]
我没


No. God no, Dad. No, it's your firm.
[.my2]
没有 我天 爸我没不高兴 这是你的公司


Like, it's not what's in it for me.
[.my2]
这跟我没什么关系


But you know, like, what is in it for me?
[.my2]
不过 到底能不能有点关系


I'd love to get you back in.
[.my2]
我倒是想让你回公司


Sure. No, sure.
[.my2]
行 也行


It's just it was tough last time.
[.my2]
可上回不怎么样


It was very tough with Frank over me in LA.
[.my2]
弗兰克在洛杉矶管我太严了


Frank's very important to the firm.
[.my2]
弗兰克对公司很重要


Oh, no, sure. No, of course, I understand that.

[.my2]
这还是因为节目吗


No... Oh, what, Robot Olympics?
[.my2]
不是... 你说机械奥运会吗


No, Dad, it's not about one fantastic idea.
[.my2]
不 爸 不只是这一个好点子


It was a culture. There were many of them.
[.my2]
这是种文化 当时有很多这种点子


What would be your dream outfit?
[.my2]
你想怎样呢


I wanna run the damn show. I do.
[.my2]
我想做那节目的制片 非常想


And until it opens up, Chief Operating Officer.
[.my2]
运行起来以后 我要做首席运营官


But I guess... I guess that's Frank, huh?
[.my2]

You OK?
[.my2]

[.my2]
不错 你呢

[.my2]

Oh, no, of course. Politics.
[.my2]
对 当然 政治


Not to be crude about it, but politics is what comes out the asshole.
[.my2]
我不想说的太直白 但政治就是拉出来的屎


Wouldn't you rather be up front, feeding the horse?
[.my2]
明明回来有体面的工作 干嘛要去玩屎


Well, Joyce, she's got that Air Force One look.
[.my2]
乔伊丝表现地像我已经入主白宫了


So... to come back, I'd want the top job.
[.my2]

Where am I? +
Where the fuck am I? +
Jesus. +
Logan? +
Logan? +
Logan, where are you? +
-Logan! -Oh, fuck. +
Where am I? +
It's OK. +
We're in the new place. +
-I'm sorry. -It's OK. +
What's that, man? +
-We're here, Mr. Roy. -This is it. +
This is the day we make it happen, Fikret. +
You're the man, Mr. Roy. +
You're the man. +
We good? +
Jesus Christ. +
Hey, hey, hey, buddy. +
Good to see you. +
So, are we ready to fuck or what? +
Yeah... OK. +
Look, I-I'm really sorry, +
but it looks like there's an issue. +
Come on, I came all the way up here, dude. +
Yeah, I'm sorry... +
Uh, dude. +
OK. +
Listen, you know I love what you do, right? +
I'd love to keep you and your team in place, Lawrence. +
I think Vaulter is the shiz. +
We're the shiz? +
Yeah. +
What's it gonna take? +
You want me to send a vintage Jaguar over to your house today? +
I'll do it. +
Um, s-sure. Look, um... +
I just think bottom line, +
I can deliver a lot more value for our shareholders. +
I hope we haven't inconvenienced you. +
I see you. I see this. +
We appreciate your interest in our little outfit, +
but I think that's it. +
Come on. That's it? +
That's not it. What the fuck happened? +
Yo, hang on. +
Hold up, hold up. +
-You get the message? -What? +
I'm not letting you Neanderthals in to rape my company. +
Ever. +
I'm sorry? +
You're a bunch of bloated dinosaurs +
who didn't even notice the monkeys swinging by till yesterday. +
Well, fuck you, daddy's boy. +
Hey, come on. Don't blow this up. +
I got a track record from founding +
one of the most exciting new media brands in the world. +
And what do you got? +
Track marks from shooting junk? +
Thanks for coming down. It was great to meet you. +
Sorry this isn't going to work out. +
No, it's gonna work out. +
No, it isn't. +
Take care, dude. +
Fuck. What the fuck, Frank? +
-I...  -How can we salvage this? +
You still want to pursue this? +
Yeah, of course I wanna pursue. +
I wanna announce. +
This is part of the whole thing. +
This is the secret sauce. +
Do we need to sweeten the offer? +
You wanna bump the offer another point? +
Do you wanna call your dad? +
Do I wanna call my dad? +
No, I don't wanna call my dad. +
Do you wanna call your dad? +
-No. -No? +
Do you wanna call your dad? +
Does anybody wanna call their dad? +
OK, nobody wants to talk to their fucking dad. +
So, we've started, so let's buy this fucking company. +
I'm pushing the bid to 120. OK? +
OK. +
How's it going? +
Yeah, I'm right in the middle, Dad. +
Did you close? +
Yeah, it's OK. +
We're not quite closed. +
I'm going to 120. +
So, that's good. +
and are we still good for the announcement? +
Uh-huh. +
Great, 'cause obviously I'm soft floating +
to, you know like, Frank and Rava, +
and there's gossip getting soft floated. +
By who? +
Uh, by the ether. +
I don't know. +
Hey, hey, happy birthday, you old geezer. +
Look, it's exciting. +
This is gonna be great for you, Dad. +
Mm-hmm. I'm excited. +
Waystar Royco is a family. +
A family that spans four continents, +
50 countries, three divisions: +
Entertainment, News and Resorts. +
Working together +
to provide a net that can hold the world, +
or catapult it forward +
to the next adventure! +
Joining Waystar Royco, you're joining +
one of the most dynamic news and entertainment companies +
in the world. +
Feel it! +
OK, how's everyone feeling? +
-Great! -Great! +
Excellent! +
Hey. You in the room? +
OK. Well, let's go out and give these kids +
the best day of their lives, huh? +
Feel it! +
-Feel it! -Feel it! +
Hi! +
Hi, Doderick! +
Hi! +
Good morning! +
It's Doderick! +
Whoo! It's me, Doderick! +
Hey, happy birthday! +
Don't pull on my tail! +
Don't hit Doderick! +
Hey! +
Quit it! +
Wait, OK. Please get off. +
Can you fuck off? +
Can you just get the fuck off? +
Ew! +
He's puking out of his eyes! +
Protein spill. +
OK, this way, this way. Come on. +
Greg? +
Hi, Mom. +
How... Are you OK? How's it going? +
Mom, sorry, but I sort of screwed up. +
Well, not me, actually, but this kid. +
Greg. +
So, this kid smoked a joint in my car. +
A kid. +
Like this hitchhiker kid that I +
picked up this morning, like earlier this morning. +
'Cause it was raining and I didn't want... +
I didn't want him to get sexually assaulted? +
Greg. +
Before I could even say anything... +
What the fuck? +
Aggressively takes out... +
Have you ever seen, like, so, a doobie? +
And the car smelled like skunk weed. +
And then I guess I smelled like it. +
And then they were just like, +
"Get all your stuff and go. " +
Greg. +
Did you even think for one second +
to tell them who you are? +
No, I thought... +
I didn't wanna be an asshole +
or get into it all. +
-OK. -I don't know. +
Here's what you're gonna do. +
You're gonna get a plane ticket to New York. +
It's your Uncle... +
Your Great-Uncle Logan's birthday, +
and they're having a big party. +
I'll call Marcia and tell her you're coming. +
It's his birthday? +
You're gonna go to the party. +
You're gonna get him a nice gift. +
And you're gonna look nice. +
In a grown-up shirt and a grown-up blazer. +
A blazer? +
I'll let you know. +
They're not gonna budge unless it gets to be a stupid number. +
What's a stupid number? +
What's stupid? A "badillion"? I don't know. +
Because 120 is stupid. Am I wrong? +
120 is a stupid number. +
But it's not really a money thing right now. +
Mr. Roy, someone's here to see you. +
-OK. Who's this? -Hi, Kendall Roy? +
Yeah, hi. +
I was sent by Roman to burn some sage. +
Excuse me? +
It's auspicious. +
I'm a business alchemist. +
It's a gift, from your brother. +
Will it set off the smoke alarms? +
Not usually. +
Not usually? +
Hey, hey, motherfuckers! +
-Roman. -My guy? +
Are you saging? +
Well, we're concerned about the alarms. +
Ooh, right, yeah, the bad juju. +
Now, I can use essential oils. +
Oh, I think just fuck off, thanks. +
How ya doing? +
Good. Good. Just finessing. +
Mm. Finessing. Nice. +
Bye. +
He's good. +
You OK, man? +
OK? Yes, I'm OK. Obviously. +
Why would you even ask that? +
I don't know. Just, you know. +
Here? Man, I'm so over it. I was a bad fit. +
I was never a corporate cock-suck anyway. +
Besides, I never made it this high in the fucking building! +
They stuck me in LA with Old Father Time right here. +
We were the pool boys, right, Frank? +
Fuckin' banana cabana? +
Good times. +
So, what's the bid? +
-What's the bid? -Mm-hmm. +
Well... +
What? That's commercially sensitive? +
I'm still on the board, man. +
Going 125. +
One-twenty-five? +
-What? -Fuck! +
What? High or low? +
-You're laughing. What? -No. +
-For Vaulter, right? -Yeah. +
Bit of content and a brand name? +
Bit of content and a brand name kinda's the whole game. +
-Isn't it? -Mm-hmm. +
What are you laughing at? +
I don't know what I'm talking about. +
You're gonna be captain of the ship soon enough. +
-So I don't... -Shh. +
Oh, shit. +
Sorry. Fuck you, man. +
Every intern on the street knows that you're stepping up. +
Seriously, congrats. +
I'm just so pleased to be out of here. +
This place was essentially a cage to me. +
I should take off. Fuck it. +
Hey, congrats, man. +
Thanks for coming by. +
Look at all this fuckin' bullshit! +
Mm, yes, mm, very serious, mm. +
Love you, brother. +
Good. +
Right. +
Just keep everything straight, OK? +
Good. +
By the way, we need another setting. +
Another family member is coming. +
-Marcy. -What? +
I'm heading out, as ordered. +
Great. Till 1:00... +
Fine. But in here, yeah? +
I don't want a fuckin' heart attack from the surprise. +
And I don't want anyone in my face when I come out of the elevator. +
Right. Distance. +
Have them here. And, uh... +
-What? -Not too loud. +
Do you want me to email you the exact details of the surprise? +
Yeah? +
-I'll see you later. -Yeah. +
Right. Get your coat. +
Yeah, yeah. +
Richard, get him his coat. +
Of course. +
-Just double-check. -OK. +
When were you gonna look at that speech? +
I'll be back by Sunday night so I'll look at his speech with him then, OK? +
OK, but his office wants the poll numbers by the preekend. +
The "preekend"? What the fuck's a "preekend"? +
Preekend is Friday. +
If he wants them by Friday, can he not say Friday? +
Thursday lunch through Friday afternoon is the preekend. +
Oh, fine. Get Rennie to look at the numbers. +
Shiv. +
This is a fuckin' disaster. +
I got to strategize my gift. +
What can I get him he'll love? +
I don't know. My dad doesn't really like things. +
He doesn't like things? +
No, not really. +
It needs to say that "I respect you, +
but I'm not awed by you. +
And that I... I like you, +
but I need you to like me before I can love you." +
So what says that? +
Just, look, everything that you get him +
will mean an equal amount of nothing, +
so make sure it looks like 10 to 15 grand's worth and you're good. +
Will you come in here and help me? +
Yes. +
Please help me. +
Yes. Get him a watch. +
If we go stupid on the stock, +
what does a really sexy package look like? Hmm? +
He's probably illiquid, right? +
So, what, we throw in another ten million? +
Might need to throw in a blow job, too. +
I'll throw in a blow job. +
I'll throw in a blow job. +
I'll throw in a reach-around. +
Hell, I'll even cup his balls. +
Dad. +
I thought you'd be in St. Barts by now. +
-How's it goin'? -Good. +
Uh, yeah. Fine. Good. +
Uh, why are you... +
Are we OK? +
Yeah, it's just some paperwork. +
What, ahead of the announcement? +
Putting Marcy on the trust. It's... bullshit. +
I, uh, I just felt like checkin' in. +
Oh. Yeah, fine. +
-So this is just the trust? -Yeah. +
Doesn't affect me stepping up? +
No, no, no, no, no. I think I told you about it. +
Is that... +
Sorry, Dad, I'm kind of in the middle of... +
Do you need... Do I need to lawyer all this? +
It's housekeeping. +
Fine. Yeah. Yeah. Marcy's fine by me. +
I mean, the others might not feel the same, but... +
I'll deal with that. +
So, I'll see you in... +
Yeah, look, Dad, on lunch. +
I really want to be with you, but the deal... +
-Son. -You know. +
It's your call. +
Just priorities. +
There'll be plenty more. +
Uh-oh. Wheat. +
Bye, Frank. +
All right, amigo. +
I have five farms, and underneath all my farms +
runs a big, giant aquifer that's like an underground lake. +
-That's so cool! -I have pumping rights. +
That means I get to take the water. +
-That's so cool! -And it's very important +
because someday water's gonna be more precious than gold +
and people are gonna kill each other to try to get that water. +
Oh, hey, hey, Con, don't, don't. +
-Don't listen to him. -Right, right, sorry. +
But I'm gonna have the water. +
And I'll share with you. +
-Hi. -Hi. +
-How are you? -Good. +
-How are you? -Good. You look great. +
-What a beautiful color. -Thanks. Same. +
-Thank you. -Love that. +
Thanks. +
-Hi, Tom. -Hey, Marcia, how are you? +
-Nice to see you. -Nice to see you. +
-How are you? -Very good. +
Hey, Global Tom. How you shaking? +
You still fucking shit up for us? +
Still cleaning up your mess, pal. +
Yeah, right. +
-Hey, sis. -Hi. +
Politics still boring the living shit out of you? +
Yeah, you know, I'm burying the bodies, counting the cash. +
Look at you. You like, you know, an actual human person. +
Well, thanks, buddy. +
-Hi.  -Oh, what is that? +
Date Rape by Calvin Klein? +
Yeah, you wish. +
"You wish"? +
-Mr. Roy!  -Mr. Roy, please! +
Mr. Roy. Over here. One shot, please. +
Say, guys, can we back off? +
-How 'bout a smile? -Guys, back off. Private event. +
Logan, Logan, you going today? Is that right? Is that right? +
-Back off, please. -Fuck off. +
-Handle that, will ya?  -Just one shot! +
Mr. Roy. +
Hi. Hello. Hello there. +
Can I help you, sir? +
Yeah, I'm actually... I'm actually here to see you. +
Get your hands back! +
Who are you? +
-What are you doing? -Greg! I'm Greg! +
I'm Marianne's Greg. Your nephew? +
-You know this guy?  -My Mom called Marcia +
and I talked to that guy and he said that I could go up. +
-We're good? -Right. +
I didn't know you were coming. +
-Yeah, you did. -Sorry about that, guy. +
-I think you did. -You all right? +
-Sorry about that. -I hope it's OK. +
I wanted to say happy birth... +
Happy birthday and many happy returns. +
Oh, thank you. +
I suppose you better come up. +
He's a very good bodyguard. +
Folks, he's back! +
He's back. Find a place. Hide for the surprise. Come on. +
Oh, we're not surprising him, are we? +
-Yeah.  -Oh, he's gonna love this. +
Think last time I surprised him, +
he took a swing at me. +
You might know this, but I got a little bit of help, +
and I got onto the international management training program? +
The theme park tour? +
And I was very into it? +
And... I got sick. +
Out of Doderick's eyeholes. +
Surprise! +
Great. Excellent. Wonderful. +
Go ahead. Go ahead. +
Hi. Hi. +
OK. OK. Give me room. Give me room. +
Thank you. Thank you. What a surprise. +
-Marcia. -What? +
What did I say? I said nobody by the elevator. +
And what do I find? Everybody's by the elevator. +
-It's a surprise. -Oh, a surprise. +
Give me that. +
In the office, please. +
Connor, Primo! How are you? +
Good. Excellent, Pa. Here you go. +
Roman! Romulus! +
Look at you! You look fantastic! +
Yeah, of course. +
Happy birthday. +
Siobhan. Sweetheart. +
Happy birthday. +
Where's Tom? +
He's here. He's just there. +
Oh, well, never mind. +
Everybody, this is... Craig, by the way. +
Cousin Craig. +
"Craig"? It's Greg. N-No? +
Yeah. Greg. +
People sometimes, like, mistakenly call me Craig, too, +
so I'll answer to both. +
Here. This is just a token of my very +
real and enduring admiration, in the hope... +
Kendall? +
You came? +
Yeah, of course. +
Happy birthday, Dad. +
-Hey, Marcy.-Hi. +
-How are you?-Big day. +
Congratulations... you bastard. +
-Congratulations. Good luck.-Thanks. +
Hey. Hey, Kendall. +
-How's it goin'?  -So! What's the news? +
Yeah, good, good. We're at the one-yard line. +
I'm just gonna... This is important. +
Uh, sorry, guys, I'll be right back. +
Excuse me. Hello. +
I hear you went down? Did you go down? +
Oh, yeah, I did. +
Not so good. +
It's a shitshow. +
Just gotta get somewhere quiet. +
Yeah, I got news. +
Hey, talk to me. +
Yeah, PPG Bank have got their nose in, +
might be rustling up another bid. +
Word's out. We gotta move. What do you wanna do? +
I'm gonna call you back in five. +
-I'm not losing this deal.  -All right. +
We call PPG, we offer to cut them in on the financing +
if they make the other bid fuck off. +
Great idea, Ken, great idea. +
Boom. Kendall takes over. Boom. Acquisition. +
That's how it's done. +
Hey, you know, I wanted to talk to you about Tom. +
He thinks he might be ready for the parks, +
-you know, globally and...  -Look, Dad, +
we should get this somewhere ambient. +
-You want to?  -Connor. How are you? +
-How's the ranch?  -Oh, perfect. +
The light pollution is practically zero, +
so, you know, that's nice. +
-Hey.  -Oh, wonderful. +
What is it? +
-Well...  -Oh, yes, yes. +
It's a... It's a goo. +
It's a fucking goo? +
It's perfect. +
It's sourdough starter. +
Amazing. +
I thought that you might like to make something. +
Ah, great. +
Yeah, OK, you shouldn't have opened it. OK? +
Never mind, forget it. +
It was an idea. I thought you might like it. +
I do. I do. +
I just don't know what the fuck it is. +
It's sourdough starter +
to make bread without yeast... The old way. +
Oh. Oh, OK. +
Old bread. Thank you. +
-It's very kind. Thank you very much -You bet. +
Be nice. +
How's it lookin'? +
Looking good. +
I'll keep you posted. +
I just checked with Frank, and the holidays mean +
the board might be kinda hard to get together, +
so if it's cool I've scheduled a call at 4:00? +
Then we can issue the release? +
You did? +
Yeah. Is that OK? +
You go on. +
I'm not going. +
-Hey. Give Daddy a hug.  -Hi, Daddy. +
Sorry we're late. +
No, no, you're not even. Don't worry. +
Twenty's the margin of error. +
Hey, sorry I haven't Skyped with you guys in a couple days. +
I've been super busy. You feel good? +
-I'm good.  -OK. +
You see Isla up there? Your friend Isla? +
You guys wanna go see her, maybe make a +
drawing for Grandpa for his birthday? +
Sorry, one second. +
It's OK. +
I got your message. That's fine. +
Oh, yeah. Yeah. +
It's just as this all goes through, +
next two weekends will be kinda crazy. +
But then once it's done, it would be great if... +
Yeah, no, it's fine. Bank the weekends, spend them later. +
OK. I can come up to you. +
Maybe if you want, we could grab dinner for the hand-over? +
Ugh. What, like two weekends? Um... +
No? Are you... Is that not... +
Are you seeing someone? +
Yeah. +
I am. +
And I'm just hoping this one doesn't leave coke smeared all over the kids' iPads. +
All right, that's fair. +
-Oh, God.  -It was three years ago, but... +
Kendall, I'm fucking with you. +
It's OK, it's OK. You're good. +
This is a big day. Coronation day. +
-Yeah.  -Hey, you deserve this. +
Seriously. After everything. +
Guys, lunch in ten. +
Listen, just two minutes before lunch in the sitting room. +
Kids. Can you give me two minutes. +
Got a speech. +
-So, Uncle Logan, can I... -Not now. +
Sorry, sir. Sir, sir, just, I need your attention, please. +
About the... what I was talking about earlier, +
the management training program? +
I need to get back in. +
-You're out? -Yes. +
There was an issue, and I talked to my mom +
who talked to my grandfather and said that I can come to you +
and... and iron it out. +
I'll do anything for my brother. +
Oh, that's... that's nice. +
And I'm gonna work 100%... +
All he needs to do is just ask. +
My grandfather? +
I mean, you two don't talk so much. +
Right? +
Anything. +
Just get him to ask me. +
Fuck! +
-Dad. -Yes. +
Yeah, what's the deal? +
So... +
On the family trust, which will decide the situation +
in the event of my unlikely demise, +
I'm going to add Marcy to myself and you four. +
Whoa. OK. +
And my seat also to go to her on my death. +
What? Wait, that gives her double voting weight. +
Uh-huh. So I've got some paperwork... +
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What? +
So Marcia will have two votes when you... +
-"If" he...  -Well, no, Rome, it's not an if. +
Well, excuse me if I don't want him to... +
Well, it's not really what we want in this case, Rome. +
Kendall's already signed, but if I can get you all to... +
Two votes? I don't think I was aware of that when I... +
Read the small print, asshole. +
I mean, this looks... +
I'm gonna have to talk to my lawyers, just for all the implications. +
Of course. +
Just to get the full picture. +
Sure, take a beat. +
But look, I love the bread... goo... +
But this is the present I really want. +
By 4:00, good? +
Oh, also, I already mentioned to Kendall, +
despite the chatter and all things considered, +
I'm going to give it a couple of years. +
As in? +
I'll stay in situ. +
As chairman, CEO, head of the firm. +
Dad, wh... you... you what? +
I just said, son, +
or were you not listening, as usual? +
But I'm... You're not... What? +
It's no big deal. I'm staying on. +
-We can discuss the details. -You didn't tell me. +
We can announce you're in pole position, +
pending events, a move up or whatever. +
-"Pending events"? -OK, come on, let's eat. +
Dad, wait. +
Oh, fuck! +
I don't know what you're fucking laughing about! +
I'm not even laughing. What?! +
Fuck. What the fuck. +
I mean, he can't just... Right? +
He's gonna blow the firm's credibility. +
Did he look OK to you? +
Oh, come on! Ken, this is typical. It's Dad. +
I'm out, OK? +
I'm not playing. +
Whatever you three decide, goes. +
-Goodbye. -Connor. +
On the trust, I refuse to play. +
I don't want to engage. I'm water, I flow. +
This doesn't stand, right? +
I... +
Oh, fucking shrug? You're fucking shrugging me? +
Are you texting? Dude, what are you... +
Hey, hey! +
-Are you telling? -Are you fucking serious? +
-What, are you 14? Private. -Hey, this stays in here. +
-OK? This is a lockdown. -We all need advice, man. +
Advice? What? You're gonna give a double vote +
to a power-hungry maniac +
who will do fuck-knows-what with it +
because she's got our dad's dick in some Super Max pussy grip +
and she's juicing him before he croaks? +
Guys? Lunch is coming up. +
Sorry, I don't mean to be strict. +
Can you give us a minute, please? Thank you. +
Hey. So... you fucked me. +
I changed my mind, Kendall. +
When? When, exactly. +
'Cause it feels like you fucked me. +
It's me. It's mainly me. +
But you... Three years ago, +
you were still in the nuthouse. +
Rehab, Dad. It's called rehab. +
And I'm in recovery. +
It's all good. +
I'm just concerned you might be soft, as yet. +
S-Soft? Are you kidding? +
I did a fucking year in Shanghai. +
I hear you let the guy from the website trash-talk you +
and you just let him come. +
It's not a website. +
And I was being professional. +
I hear it played weak. Conflict averse. +
I wasn't about to get into a fucking big dick competition. +
OK? +
I hear you bent for him. +
Wha... I what? +
I hear you bent for him and he fucked you. +
Well, no, actually. +
I know that you've read a lot of books +
about business management and this and that, +
but you know what? +
What? +
Sometimes it is a big dick competition. +
OK. OK. So that's it? +
So I should have shouted at some guy, but I didn't. +
So you've ripped up 18 months of corporate strategy? +
And you never lawyered the trust change. +
I trusted my father. That's a black mark? +
It's an accumulation. +
You left the room. The deal. +
To come to my Dad's fucking birthday party +
'cause we don't know how many more there'll be! +
Sorry. +
So come on. +
When will you be ready? +
To step down? +
I don't know. +
Five? +
Five years? +
Ten? +
Ten! Dad? Seriously! +
It's my fuckin' company. +
Yeah, it is your fucking company, and you know what? +
You're running it into the fucking ground. +
You spend all your time on costs... +
Where's the vision? You're off the beat. +
Where's the growth? All our graphs go down. All of them. +
Is that why you're paying a billion dollars for a gay little website? +
It is not a fucking website! +
It's a portfolio of online brands and digital video content +
and it's part of an upstream investment strategy +
to save us, if you'll just let me. +
Do you want to hit me, is that it? +
Huh? +
Go on. +
Go on. +
Give it your best shot. +
Dad, come on. What are you doing? +
Are you gonna fuckin' cry? +
Kendall, are you fuckin' crying? +
You know, this has been floated already? +
There's fucking paps outside. I'm getting asked for quotes. +
Fuck them. +
Yeah, 'course, "fuck 'em." +
Great, great media strategy, Dad. +
Great business strategy. +
-The world is changing... -Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. +
Yeah, everything changes. +
The studio was gonna tank when I bought it, +
everyone was gonna stay home with video tapes. +
But guess what? No! They wanna go out. +
No one was gonna watch Network, +
except you give it zing and they do. +
You make your own reality. +
And once you've done it, apparently, +
everybody's of the opinion it was all so fucking obvious. +
Lunch! +
Come on. Find your places. Sit. +
Please give me my seating plan. +
This is confusing. Sorry. +
She was drunk and sitting in Gore Vidal's lap. +
She's very funny. +
-Your mom's very funny. -Who's Gore Vidal? +
She's the one, you know, with the hair, and she usually wears the clothes? +
-Yeah. -Yeah. +
Yeah, no, I remember your daughter. +
Marcy. This was delicious. Thank you. +
Thank you. +
The whole day. Really thoughtful. +
It's been great. +
Thank you very much. +
You're a suck-up. +
I'm happy to have you. +
"You are so swell, Double Vote Power Mom!" +
You know what? Fuck you. +
If you'll excuse me... +
Logan Roy. +
Born in Dundee, Scotland, 80 years ago today, +
raised in Quebec by an uncle with a print shop and a few advertising billboards +
and an aunt with a herd of cattle. +
Logan himself has made a decent way for himself these past 60 years. +
Fifth largest media conglomerate in the world. +
A pal to prime ministers, a truth teller to presidents. +
He's tough, he's wily, +
but he's always true to his word. +
I arrived to give him legal advice 30 years ago, +
and I never got out the door. +
And since that day, I'm proud to call him a friend. +
So, let's raise a toast. +
Logan Roy. +
Logan Roy. +
Thank you. +
So, I think it's time to play the game. +
We're playing the game? +
Well, yes. +
It's my birthday, so yes, we're playing the game. +
Do we have to play the game? +
What's the game? +
What's the game? +
Nice day! You OK, Greg? +
Sure. I'm not... Is there room in there? +
Hop in. +
I'm sorry if it's a crush. +
It's fine. +
I was just talking to my grandpa. +
And he said happy birthday. +
Did he? +
Well, no, not technically, +
but he's aware it's your birthday. +
But it occurred to me, talking to him, +
that him having his seat on the holding company still, +
from historically, +
now, that must be suboptimal, in some ways. +
But if I could... if he was willing to give his seat +
to someone a bit more perspicacious, +
someone who could learn the ropes, running a theme park, say. +
Running the parks? +
Just a little guy. Learning, you know? +
I mean, could that be...? +
You scratch my back, I... +
I'm not gonna say I could scratch yours. +
It's be too considerable of a space. +
But is there an angle there, perhaps? +
So... what're you thinking, son? +
On the thing? +
She's very smart. +
She'd make good picks. Family first. +
I'm sure. I'm sure. +
But what's your cut? +
Um... No. +
No. God no, Dad. No, it's your firm. +
Like, it's not what's in it for me. +
But you know, like, what is in it for me? +
I'd love to get you back in. +
Sure. No, sure. +
It's just it was tough last time. +
It was very tough with Frank over me in LA. +
Frank's very important to the firm. +
Oh, no, sure. No, of course, I understand that. +
It's just I had a lot of ideas at the studio. +
As you know, I'm quite an innovative thinker, +
and I was met with a lot of resistance. +
Is this still the film thing? +
No... Oh, what, Robot Olympics? +
No, Dad, it's not about one fantastic idea. +
It was a culture. There were many of them. +
What would be your dream outfit? +
I wanna run the damn show. I do. +
And until it opens up, Chief Operating Officer. +
But I guess... I guess that's Frank, huh? +
You OK? +
Sure. You? +
The boys are here! +
Just right this way. +
That was my first helicopter ride. +
It was so crazy. +
It goes so much faster than I thought. +
Hey, it's good to see you. +
OK, let's get a glove. +
Let's have a second. +
What time is it? +
-Toss it over here! -Come on back, come on back. +
Now that things are getting shaken up, would you come inside? +
Dad, I'm not just playing with the politics. +
Oh, no, of course. Politics. +
Not to be crude about it, but politics is what comes out the asshole. +
Wouldn't you rather be up front, feeding the horse? +
Well, Joyce, she's got that Air Force One look. +
So... to come back, I'd want the top job. +
And if that was difficult? +
Overseeing everything outside the US, parks and all. +
What, like... Tom's boss? +
Yeah. Stepping stones. +
What's the rescue pup looking for? +
He screwed up. Needs help. +
He might fit in eventually to the parks. +
Do you think Tom can handle the competition? +
Mr. Roy. All set. +
There you go. +
Hey. +
So, just wanted to give this to you +
in person just to say, you know, happy birthday. +
Hold that, will you? +
It's just a Patek Philippe. So... +
Yeah, it says "Patek Philippe." +
Yeah. I know. +
It's incredibly accurate. +
Every time you look at it, +
it tells you exactly how rich you are. +
That's very funny. +
Did you rehearse that? +
No. Well, no. Yes. But... +
OK. Yeah. +
Here. +
OK, let's play ball. +
So, what are you thinking? +
We say no, all of us, on the trust. Full block. +
Stability. Stick to the plan. +
I take over and we just... +
You two, under me, co-presidents. +
-Under you? -Uh-huh. +
But, you know, three. The power of three? +
Interesting. +
-Can we think about it? -Of course. +
I thought about it. Fuck you. +
Go, Rava! +
Psych your mind! +
Go! +
That's a strike. +
-Got her looking! -That's good pitching. +
-Change sides! -Hey, man. +
It was balletic, though, +
kinda came around.. +
I hear you're the new kid. Yeah? +
Oh, well, I mean, I'm just kinda starting... +
-I hear you're coming in. -Yeah. +
Yeah, eyes on the prize. +
Well, I have got my eye on you. +
You need any help, +
seriously, any help, any advice, just, you know, +
don't fuckin' bother, OK? +
I'm only razzing you, cuz. +
You're dreaming, really. +
I'm razzing you. +
-OK. -That was a joke. +
No, really. +
You know, the thing, I may look really fun, +
-you know? -Yeah. +
But the thing about me +
is that I'm a terrible, terrible prick. +
I got you again. I just got you again. +
Fuck me, man, your face. +
Pals. Yes? +
Yeah. +
Would you kiss me? +
-What? Kiss you? -Would you? +
If I asked you to? +
-Would I kiss you? -If I told you to? Huh? +
-I don't...  -Come on. +
I'm joking. I'm joking. +
-All right, Siobhan. -Bring it! +
Batter swing! +
Just like that! +
Hold up. Hang on, hang on. Sorry. +
-Apologies. -Boo! Boo. +
Honey, boo him. +
-Yeah. OK. Sorry. I gotta run. -Boo! +
It's the crunch. +
Frank, will you be link man here? +
Dad? +
Of course. +
Come here, sweetie. +
Well, if Kendall's going, we need one more to make it fair! +
Keep it up, slugger. +
The kid. Hey! Hello! +
Hello! Kid. Yeah. Yes. +
You. You. You wanna play? +
Dad, can he play? +
Yes. Sure. +
Thank you, Dad. +
Yeah, hey, what's up? +
I just got some background +
for the story I heard you had cookin'. +
That's right. Yeah, I know Kendall Roy. +
And he's saying Logan's lost it. +
Yeah, that's right. +
Some board members and senior management, +
they want him out. +
That's what I'm hearing from people close to the family. +
Those disloyal fucks. +
Just... Just say source close to the family. +
-That's high. -Too high. +
You're gonna be fine. Relax, don't worry about it. +
-Can you hit a ball? -Yeah. +
Great, because I will give you +
one million dollars if you hit a home run. +
-I'm dead serious, OK? -For real? +
Yes, for real. A million dollars. +
Honey, where's the... your bag? +
Hey, I'll do it for a million. Give me that. +
Just kidding. You're good. +
All right. +
I don't know why you're smiling. I am dead serious. +
I will give you one million dollars, cash, +
for a home fucking run. +
Rome, don't be an asshole. +
I'm not being an asshole. I want him incentivized. +
This is fun. +
It's a game. Jeez, stop being so serious. +
Huh? +
Witnesses. +
Good luck. I believe in you. +
All right, let's do this! +
One million dollars. +
OK, come on. +
-That's it. -Run, kid! +
-That's a hit. -That's a damn hit. +
Come on, Shiv! I'm here, Shiv! +
-Come on! -Tom! +
Come on! Come on, run faster! +
-No! No! -Bad luck, kid. +
Oh, no! You were so damn close! +
That was so close! +
Oh, my goodness! +
Oh, that is so sad! Oh, I'm sorry. +
I can't give it to you. That would have counted, by the way. +
That was almost a home run, if you went all the way around. +
But it was a really good effort. +
Really. Quite tremendous. +
So take this back to your life. +
It's a quarter million. Enjoy. +
Son... magnificent effort. +
-Thank you. -Magnificent. +
-Come here. -It's OK. +
Hey, Lawrence. +
Sorry the other offer fell through. +
I don't know what happened. +
But we fattened the goose nice now, right? +
The number is 140. +
Cash, with a stock alternative. +
You're on our board. +
Take the stock, you'll own a nice piece of us. +
Well, that is an appealing package. +
It is, yeah. It's appealing. +
You better play nice, though. Because I'm the whole company. +
Yeah, I think you're gonna stick around +
because I'm gonna stuff your mouth with so much money +
you're gonna shit gold figurines. +
Non-disclosure agreement. Non-voting shares. Non-compete. +
I'm going to lock you in a golden cage, fuck you with a silver dildo, +
and pay you so much you sing whatever song I want. +
-Easy. You still need me to recommend this. -No, I don't. +
This is a deal so fucking good you have to take it, +
or we'll see you in court. +
Dude. +
How you doing, sir? How's everything? +
I'm Colin. I work for Mr. Logan Roy and the Roy family. +
We'd like to keep this quiet today, if you'll agree to that. +
We'd like to have you sign a non-disclosure agreement. +
-You wanted five? -Oh, Frank. Yeah. +
I've been thinking +
if now isn't a time for a new role for you. +
OK. As in what sort? +
Light duties. +
Light duties. +
Are you kidding me? Logan. Me? +
There should be a press release on your phone. +
Proof it. +
You might want to give it a bit of color, it's quite dry. +
That's it? To me. That's it? After 30... +
Jesus Christ. Here? +
You are what you do, Logan. You know that? +
In the end, you're just what you do. +
Don't worry, you'll get your nut. +
Connor! +
Shiv! Roman! +
The other helicopter. +
Colin, see to it. +
Well, officially the deadline has passed. +
So... what do you say, kids? +
What's the Frank situation? +
Frank's out of the picture. +
Yeah? +
Frank's dead. Tom's stepping up, +
and Shiv's thinking about a new role. +
So, are we good? +
Um... Shiv? +
Rome? +
Con? +
I'm with these two. What they say goes. +
Our position is this doesn't quite work for us. +
At present. +
You what? +
It's not sufficiently attractive as a proposition. +
Are you fuckin' joking? +
We get that. We do. +
And we would love to help. I would love to help. +
Then help. +
But why would I when I'm giving away power? +
Why would I do that? +
-So... so Kelly, uh... -Who's Kelly? +
Kelly will set up some figures. +
-He should see that, uh... -Dad? +
-Dad? -Yeah, he... +
Dad, it's just a first position. Dad? +
Get a grasp of what... what... +
-Dad! Dad! -Dad! +
Dad! +
-Dad! Dad! -Dad! Dad! +
Just, yeah. A hospital. Take us to a hospital. +
OK, yeah, now! +
Has he fainted? +
-He fainted? He's hot. -He's really hot. I don't know. +
-Kendall? -Yeah. +
Have you heard the news? +
What? +
Deal. +
It's all very exciting. I can't wait to... +
-We got a deal? -Yeah. +
-Serious? -Yes? +
Oh, dude. +
Listen, I think... +
I think you've made a really great decision +
and I hope there's no hard feelings over all the shit-talking. +
Oh, no, no, it's cool. +
It's cool. +
So, the news I was talking about +
is that your dad just had a brain hemorrhage. +
What? +
Yeah. I'm so sorry. +
-Are you... -But... +
you just invited me into the chicken coop. +
And without Daddy around to protect you, +
I'm gonna eat you all. +
One by fucking one. +
Hello? +
Kendall. Thank God. +
We've been trying to reach you. Um... +
Dad is in the hospital. +
He's... +
We were in the helicopter, and we got here really fast, +
but they think... +
We don't know. They think he's had a brain hemorrhage. +
If you could get here really soon, +
that'd be good. +
I'm sorry. +
Most first-time homebuyers would love to live in Newport Beach. +
But average home price in Newport Beach is over $1 million. +
