Okay, hold on, hold on.

Nice.

Oh, Rasmussen?

Hi. Hey, Tom.   -Hi.

I... Just put it there.   -Put this here?

Okay

So, it's election eve

and guess what Father Sex mas has brought you?

Why, hot fresh polling

Yeah. Jimenez up by four.

Jesus. How are you gonna play?

I guess, I don't know.

Amplify to gin up our maniacs

Or deny, shit on, and bury, I guess

Mats son.   -What does he want?

Oh, you know.

He thinks the Living Plus stock bump is fading

and he wants to know what my brothers have cooking

Is he coming?   -To the party? No.

No, he doesn't wanna swim around my dad's

"bullshit pre-election brain dead AOL-era legacy media

putrid stuffed-mushroom fuck fest."

I thought it was gonna be fun

So, this is just a little party prezzie

for being such a hot piece of ass

Thank you.   -and such a foxy little minx.

And, you know, just to say

that I'm really glad that we're hosting this party together

Yeah. .   -You know, we could say to people

that we... had a little break

and then we're back, you know?

Yeah. I like that.   -Yeah

-What?   -Yeah.

It's a... a scorpion.

Because?

Cause it's...

it's funny.

Because... why?

Cause it's like... it's a joke

Who's the scorpion?

You, I guess.

But it's just silly, honey. It's like, you know.

I love you, but you kill me, and I kill you, and you.

You know?

Okay, yeah, right. No, yeah. I get it.

-I like it.   -Good.

-Well, you gotta get to work.   -Yeah

You know, you gotta go contribute to the great toxification.

Gotta do my part.

Are you okay?

How's everyone doing?   -No, I'm fine. We're all fine.

And, you know, this is fine, but if it's legal stuff

I really need to keep my head out of that right now.

I'd rather keep it with just...  -Okay

Iawyers, so...   -No. I wilI just keep this brief.

It's.

Sophie doesn't wanna go to school.

She's... freaked out about the election.

What do you mean? What... is she okay? What...

What is it? What...   -She's okay. It's just...

All right, so, on the... the weekend, this weekend

someone kind of...

She felt... pushed by her a little, on the street.

But there was a comment that she felt came from the...

It was.

All right, the guy had on a Raven head shirt

There was a quote on the shirt, and yeah

She felt it was racially tinged, and she's been upset.

What did they say?

I don't know.

And now, at school

some kids have started this whole anti-ATN thing

which is actually very supportive

but, you know, it's...

complex for her?

Who was with her?

Why... Why was she out on the street?

Sixth near MOMA?   -Did you just ask me

-why she was on the street?   -Yeah, I mean, someone.

You're telling me someone pushed our daughter

or whatever.   -Pushed by her

She was with her friends.   -Like, where were you?

Where was I?   -Yeah

-Are you fucking serious?   -I'm not blaming you.

I'm just... I'm trying to get all the information

before I make a decision on our course of action

You need Tomake a decision -And, so, yeah

-if you're gonna call your...   -Where were you?

I was raising our daughter

-while you were fucking running -Oh, yeah

-a racist news organization.   -Yeah... Great

-Fuck you. Come on...   -Oh, fuck me?

How fucking dare you interrogate me?

On how I parent?   -Obviously, I feel bad.

Obviously, I will do anything

to protect her, anything,   -Okay, you know what?

Okay. I'm gonna just end.

We'll cope.

And I don't know, just may be call your fucking daughter

Well, obviously. Jesus, Rava. Jesus

What kind of parent do you think I am?

You know, yoUhave no idea the things I'm doing

the things I'm working on.

Six continents, okay?

I'm breaking my back, and it's all for them.

Okay? Tomake the world safe.

Yeah, great. Dig on that

Dig to heck on that. Dig

Yeah, no, we... we love the deal

We just have to make sure we know everything

on Mats son and GoJo.

I mean, there's due diligence

but this is, you know, un due diligence.

Extra diligence, okay?

Okay. great. And get that dirt on Mats son.

Anything could be useful

Apparently, insignificant details could be very useful Tome,

to us.

What? No.

You're a fucking deputy rat fucker.

Don't object to being a rat fucker, Tomas

It's unbecoming.

How you doing?   -Hey, honey

Kiss?

-Good to see you,   -Good to see you.

Hi.   -Hey. How you doing?

-Good.   -Yeah.

I just came from seeing Pop

Again?

-Yeah.   -Well, any... change?

Looking good

Woke up on the right side of the coffin today, boy.

What? I like to go. You should go.

Yeah? And do what?

Sit there like I'm feeding the ducks?

Can I... Thank you for ignoring me.

The weird thing, honestly, is.

how much he's not there

I find that consoling.

Well, here he is.

-Kendall Plus.   -Hey, hey. Morning.

Good morning. Sorry I'm late.   -Hey.

The man who's gonna lead us to eternal life.

Right.   -Way star Jesus.

Have you seen the polling today?

Okay, that's why you're all perky.

Very exciting, I'm sure your Red Guards are all, you know

ready to come round up the thought criminals

and turn police stations into cuddle puddles

The exciting part isn't the top line.

In Alaska, I'm exploding

Four, five, six percent.

Right, guys, can we do this?

I just, I have a lot going on today

-Sure.   -Very well.

I hereby convene this funeral management committee.

I've sent the materials

and I assume you've familiarized yourselves

Because I'm concerned.

We're saying yes to all Marcia's wishes

then all your ideas, Pop's requirements

Danger the funeral could turn into a three-day grief-a-thon.

-Yeah, just fuck Marcia.   -Seconded.

Great.   -Carried.

Nevertheless, we really want a tight 90.

And the central question is...

who's gonna speak?

Oh, what, in front of the most powerful, political, cultural

business interests in the world?

I mean, I'm easy

Right? I could speak about Dad.

On what? Your usual malign influence material?

I could do it.

I think if any one of us actually wants to do it

do the big number, then we should just say

because, probably, no one minds, right?

No? Yeah.

Okay, will yoUhave a think?

I'm jumping on the digital battle bus.

Tailgate party, we nail it down, yeah?

Okay. Bye-bye.   -Sure.

All right. Good luck.   -Bye.

Right.

So, Shiv, on the...

One thing from us, on the tailgate

we were actually wondering about us politically inviting Nate

-Nate Sofrelli?   -Nate.

Okay.

Tom and I kind of had hoped that.

Why?

Because it went so well in LA

You know, hats off to the Greatest Showman here.

And apologies on the old wibble wobble

and all due congratulations, but...

Okay, so you wanna make sure we have a plan B

in case we can't chase Mats son out of town on price.

Exactly, and we think that's regulatory.

-We go hard regulatory.   -Yeah

DO J, FTC, FCC, EU.

-No?   --I mean... I...

I think they might just stop it

Yeah.   -But... but even just the threat

creates a ton more risk for Matsson,

kicks the deal down the line, right?

And Nate, he's...

Right? He's across competition

and he's tight with the Jimenez folks on that, so.

Can we get him down?

So we can sell it on a real level without lobbyists and all the...

Due process?

That stuff.   -Yeah.

Yeah, sure. Fine.

Good? Okay.   -Fine.

-All right, see you tonight.   -See you tonight

Beat you to it.

Good, yeah?   -Yeah, good

I think so. What else?

How are you feeling about the, you know, blowback

from, you know, the firing?

The bloodlust?

Do you wanna throw Hugo at that?

Fuck it, let's own it.

Hey, Lukas. Yeah, listen.

So, they're gonna go regulatory

Yeah.

So, you need to be there tonight

No. It'll be easy. Just.

My dad invited you, so...

Yes.

There's gonna be, what.

40 thought leaders, pols, officials

who will actually decide this.

and half of them are gonna be there, okay?

So, I am telling you that you need to be there, too.

To counter.

So... hey.

There's no easy way of doing this

I've done this a couple of times this week

and sometimes, honestly, it just makes me cry.

But I wanted to offer my heartfelt appreciation to you all

and now I'm gonna hand over Tomy colleague, Gregory Hirsch

who has more information

Thank you, sir.

Good morning.

Good morning.

I'm here to inform you that Way star Roy co

has been looking at a range of different options

in order to drastically reduce costs

and a very difficult decision

to restructure the ATN operation internationally

has been taken in order to protect the future of the business

This action was only taken

after seriously considering all available options

But if you're on this call, this is confirmation

that you are part of the unlucky group

who are having their contract terminated

with immediate effect

on the grounds of staffing redundancy

and today is your final day of employment

Final day of employment.

Going forward, we intend to operate

Way star Roy co international news gathering operations

utilizing third-party contract-based arrangements."

I'm seeing some confusion in the chat.

But yes, if I have been too wordy

yes, we are letting all of you go.

Obviously, I can't take questions on this call

but this is a very sad day

And I thank you for your time today

and your service to Way star Roy co

Goodbye

Nice. Done.

So, this German one with this label

let's push this, okay?

Say it's a light, fruity red.

Now, don't say it's biodynamic, and don't say it's German.

Just say it's a light, fruity red

And yes, a little bit of fizz is normal

It's sophisticated, okay?

It's okay. What's going on? Wakey-wakey

I'm just... you know. I'm fine.

I'm tired, you know? Election eve.

-It's a lot.   -Yeah

And it turns out, I'm pre-tired

I'm tired about thinking how tired I'm gonna be

because someone isn't letting someone get a lot of sleep

Well, forgive me.

-So, we got a couple of extra names for the guest list.   -Right

Mats son is, in fact, coming now

Because?

Because Dumb and Dumber are trying to spook the deal, and.

wanna try doing regulatory shit angle

and he's gonna come and head that off, so...

Okay. Well, good. That's good for me, right?

I mean, it's my chance to dance.   -Yeah.

I could secure my spot...

-Yeah, sure.   -post Roy-poc alyse, right?

Also, to push that agenda

they wanted to invite, and I didn't feel like I had

a tactical way to say no.

They want to invite Nate.

Cause he's key on tech and trade

for Gil and Jimenez.

I'm sorry, I...

It's not...

And I am genuinely sorry. Really

Sure. Nate.   -Yeah

It'll be good to see Nate.

What do I care?

-Okay.   -It's okay.

-Thanks, honey.   -Okay

Okay, you guys ready to spread some regulatory anxieties?

Yeah, sure, spread those surveillance capitalism heebie-jeebies, yeah?

Just don't let me get stuck with the Journal op-ed ogres

Come on, they're not all

crypto fascists and right-wing nutjobs

We also have some venture capital Dems

and centrist ghouls

Dad's ideological range was wide

Should we hit it?   -Yeah, let's hit it

-Let's hit it.   -All right

Hitting it, hit it. Hey. What's up?

Not your guy's poll numbers.

Do I look tired?   -No...

Yeah, may be a little.

Oh, man.   -May be drink a coffee.

If I drink a coffee, then I won't be able to sleep later

Think, Greg.

So, anyway, listen. Mats son is coming

So, that is gonna be my focus

And you, if...

Unless you are truly aligning yourself to the dumpster brothers

you might wanna sweeten that beat, too

Oh, yeah, yeah. I'd love to... feather that bed.

But Mats son hates me, so I think I'm team Ken Ro

Up to you, Greg

Okay, I'm gonna mingle.   -Yeah, mingle up.

Thanks.

Okay, okay.

Looks like Shiv's hitting Valerie.

Have you seen Nate?

Yeah, no. But Mencken's team called

Okay. Because... the polling?

Yeah, well, their internals, even worse, so...

And they want what?

ATN to go full " We're coming to give your guns hormone therapy

All your guns are gonna be ladies "?

Well, three or four states where Connor's one percent

are throwing things

You know, could be pivotal.

And, you know, if he were to drop out

most of the support would go to them

But his team is not...

It's just... They're just refusing contact, apparently.

So, they've asked if I can convince him to drop out

I mean, I don't know

-Fuck that guy, right?   -Mencken?

I think, yeah. Victory vans, those O'Malley fucks

I think fuck him.

I guess, I mean, it's not bad for us to be tight with them

in case things swing his way, right?

Yeah, fine. I see you. All right. I'll hit the...

I'll hit the lib tards, you go help the Nazis

The Nazis. You got it

Wait. Excuse me

Thank you.

-Hey.   -Hey, Tom.

Hello, Nathaniel

Appreciate the invite

Well, I've missed you

I won't be long. A lot going on. Honestly

I won't drink too much of your wine

No, don't you worry. You gobble my grav ad lax, pal

There's plenty more where that came from.

It's light and fruity

and it's the kind of wine that separates the connoisseurs

from the weekend Malbec morons.

Keep away from this man, Nate.

Keep away from you.   -Back...

Back, foul news demon.   -No, you. You're the foul demon

Nice to see you, Len. Good one.

Asshole.

-Hey.   -I'm sorry to interrupt

Can I grab him for a second?

-Yeah.   -Okay.

-What's up?   --Yeah, just.

You know...

Yeah, yeah, kind of a biggie, actually, and a bit last-minute.

But Mencken's team called

and they wanted to know if you might be willing to...

you know, drop out.

-Of the election?   -Yes, of the election.

You are aware that the polls open in ten hours?

Yeah, so it might be too late

to physically remove your name from the ballots

But if you were to release a statement,you know

divert the Con head stream to the Mencken river?

And after all the blood and treasure I've expended

why on earth would I wanna do that?

They said for the good of the Republic

Yeah?   -Yeah.

Yeah. So... no?

No.

Well, then, I have been authorized

Tomake a follow-up offer,

which is...

How familiar are you with Mogadishu?

Mogadishu? In Somalia.

Because they are very impressed with your talents

and they think that you'd be a good fit

for an ambassadorial appointment.

A little bit car-bomb y

Hey, tell him UN.

-Okay.   -That's more my vibration, yeah?

All right.   -Yeah?

All right, I'll report back.   -Okay

All right, thanks.   -Thank you

Hey.

How're you doing? Good to see you

Hey. So, she showed. That's good

Guess you smoothed it over, right, General Franko?

No, she's incredibly angry

Okay, everybody. Everybody

Welcome, one and all

-Ken, take it away.   -Okay, thanks, Tom. Thanks, Tom

Thank you, thank you. Okay, okay

Okay, welcome, everybody. Welcome, welcome.

Welcome. All right.

Who we go t here, who we got here?

Carly Flight.

Oh, shit. The pod goddess.   -All right, all right

Everybody watch out for her.

Careful what you say

That's right. Yeah, yeah. Careful what you say

-Larry, Mary, lovely. Lovely to see you guys.   -You, too

Who else is here? Who's here?

Len. Len giveth and Len taketh away

Watch out for Len

My guy Nate Sof rell i saw the polls this morning

and moon walked here

Our best to Gil and Jimenez.

Everybody's here. It's great to see you all.

Yeah, you know, it's our first tailgate party without the big guy

Yeah. But we're still gonna live it up

As always, kettle corn over there...

will be shipped to whoever is closest to tomorrow's electoral count.

And...

Yeah, this is a tough one

But we're all gonna stay sane, and we're all gonna stay friends

Yeah?

Thanks Tomy sis for hosting

-Thank you, sis.   -Of course

But yeah, you know, we... didn't know what to do this year

You know... We watch history

We make history

And then, one day, we become it.

So, can I just.

I'd just like to ask you all for a moment of silence, if we could

In memory

Thank you. Thank you, y'all

Sorry.

It's okay. Hey, man

So, VIP in the house

Mr. Mats son, how are you? Welcome.

Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Thank you

You know, you don't get my sister's triplex in the deal, you know.

Don't get greedy

Well, you know, hey, we haven't closed yet, so...

We'll see, I guess, what happens.   -Nice, nice

Anyway, welcome.

You know, my dad... my dad loved you all

we love you all

so, let's... let's have some fun

Let the games begin

Salud.

Cheers, cheers. All right

Okay. What the fuck is he doing here?

Yeah, I don't know. Seriously, it's like... the fuck?

It's gonna blow up on the spot.   -Yeah, yeah

So, apparently, Dad invited him, actually

And he-emailed a yes, like, four minutes before walking in

-Four? Okay, well...   -Yeah

Do we just throw him out, then?   -I would love that

No, but I don't think we can afford to be seen

treating him as the enemy

I think we hang tough. Yeah?

Just stick to the plan, regulatory

You know, these assholes in here?

Our assholes

Yeah, but what's his fucking game?

Like, is he going for freak out

or is he flicking the same beans as us?

Well, how do you wanna play?

Honestly, like, he...

There's too much peanut butter between us

Can you stick close?

Yeah. Sure.

I think just guide him away from the high-value targets

refill his glass, run him in circles

tell people he's Looney Tunes behind his back.   -Easy.

Keep him from the big wigs

So, operation just, like, Nuke the Luke.

-Yeah.   -All right. Yeah, I can do that.

Okay.   -Let's do it.

Let's smash that Swede

I'm tired. It's a lot, you know.

Pre-election prep, you know

Oh, right. Yeah, I be t, I bet.

Yeah. It's a lot.

Hey, so, are you, like.

In the company, are yoUhands-on or more of an overview guy?

Interesting. I guess.

Well, let me ask you this

What would you value more highly?

Really? No.

Because I like to think that I could do both

You know, I get my hands dirty and clean noggin and, you know...

Multi-tasker.   -Okay

You're kissing my ass.

No, I'm not kissing your ass, Lukas

You're too smart, you'd spot it a mile off.

I'm about to take a shit in your husband's mouth

and I'm pretty sure he's gonna tell me

it tastes like coq a u vin

No, no, I'm not, I'm not

No, but seriously, it's a really, really nice place

-Thank you.   -Thanks. Thank you.

Who'll get to keep it in the divorce?

-Yeah, shall we hit up some people?   -Yeah, good to see you

-Talk to you later.   -All right

Yeah.

It's good to see you

Yeah, yeah. You too, Gary.

So, you need to hit Nate, Carly, Valerie first

But I have to keep an eye out for my brothers, and you just need

You've done this before, so just don't...

-You know. Don't...   -Don't what?

Don't scream "people are data " and stick my dick in the guac?

-Yeah. Sure. Don't... Yeah.   -Don't do that. Okay

Yeah, you're about to purchase one of the most prized cultural assets

and political communication channels in America

and you need to prepare the ground

because otherwise, your many fucking enemies

will portray you as some jerk-off coder from Gothenburg, okay?

I am a jerk-off coder from Gothenburg

Right, Ebba?

You remember Ebba?   -Hi, yeah.

Good to see you again.

-How are you?   -You, too.

Oh, I'm, you know... Who cares?

Who cares? Yeah. Charming

Okay, oh, well, not that you need to do anything about this now

but you should fire your lobbyists, just so you know

You need rainmakers, not weather forecasters.

Sure. It's just not really my arena.

I'm sorry. It's more Andreas.

You don't have to apologize, Ebba, it's

It's just information we're sharing, so...

It's... social anxiety

The only PR person in the world who hates talking to people

Yeah, I don't love parties, but I'm good

Whereas I love them

I do.

-Skal.   -Yep.

So, I have a number two who's moon-beamed on edibles

and a communication officer who's terrified of communicating

Oh, brilliant.

So, Mogadishu's a no-go

-Of course.   -It's a death sentence.

Frankly, we're insulted

-But...   -Are you?

I would like to roll through all the options

So, as a brother...

-what's the top option?   -Okay

Let me... Let me have a little look

I would love to get to Europe.

Can I creep up through the underbelly?

Come up through the Balkans?

Couple of senior departures, Berlin by Christmas?

They may be willing to talk Slovenia or Slovakia

Yeah, I think I'm a no on the Slos.

What about South Korea?

South Korea.

Top ten GDP

major geopolitical player

I feel like that would be tough.

North Korea.

Oh, easy, my liege

You don't know. Nobody knows. That's the point.

I could open it up like Nixon did China.

Con, they're not gonna put you anywhere with nukes

Well, that's insulting. I don't think I wanna go anywhere

-that doesn't have nukes.   -All right. Well...

How do you like Oman?

Oman?

Yeah, poor man's Saudi Arabia or rich man's Yemen.

I have to check.

See what my woman thinks about Oman

-Nice. Yep. Good.   -All right, good

Well, I... I guess, essentially, I'm a self-made guy

who came up with a really cool product that people love

I... I send you my 9.99 a month

-I'm no hater.   -Appreciate it.

But Daniel is troubled by out-of-control algos.

-You see, he is worried that you...   -Yeah.

Bleep bloop guys are gonna data-mine us all to death

Yeah. No, no, I totally get that

And in terms of all this someone's gonna pick up the assets, right?

So, who's that gonna be?

Is it gonna be, and no offense, Shiv

but the fail sons?

Really? Is that a good option?

They will do what he did, but they will do it stupider

and uglier, and less amenable

And, surprisingly, Lukas is actually pretty amenable

Amenable?   -Yes.

What about leadership at ATN ?

Well, I would definitely make some major leadership changes

-at the top at ATN , yes.   -Really?

Oh, Tom.

I can't wiggle my way in there.

He's just busy slobbering up Nate with Shiv.

They're just talking, Greg

Can you... Can you push a few more of these, and.

No, actually, put them away

so we create a kind of scarcity thing

-Hey, man.   -Hey, man

Brother.

Been a minute.

Listen, I know we have n't had a chance to talk

I'm sorry, man.

Yeah.   -He was...

What can I say? Jesus, I can't imagine.

Yeah, it's tough, but, you know

life keeps a-rollin', right?

But you, man.

You, throwing off some kingmaker vibes

Fuck yeah. How's Daniel?

Can I shoot you names?

You know, you could make a decent.

You could make a decent cabinet from my fucking poker night

Sure, yeah, yeah. The activists would love that

Look, dude, I'm just gonna give you my rap straight

Okay? Is that okay?

I think we could be really good for you guys.

Like, I'm talking major reset of the dialogue

Which I am personally invested in

But that only happens if this deal goes away

Yeah, you know, board-wise, shareholder-wise

we can't come out publicly

but the deal, you should know the deal is headed to the woodshed

GoJo has had incredible growth, he's a charismatic figure

but he's gonna get wrung out

And you know, there is really legitimate concern here.

DOJ or FTC balking at the sports overlap

the FCC over foreign ownership of broadcasts.

-He's pitching me.   -No, I'm... I'm telling you

I think maybe CFI US

might have a word to say about Mats son's, you know

extreme political positions and fucking Holocaust jokes

Sure, so... so what?

So, you guys come out for regulation pretty soon

and we give you a better ride in the first hundred days

Man, I forgot how eager you were to get laid at a party

Let me check in.

Cool. All right. Love it

Would love to get laid

Can we have the room?

So, you're doing great. Yeah, eminently plausible

Nice wordings.   -Yeah?

Really?   -Yeah

-Yeah, you're doing good, yeah.   -Nice, nice.

Nate, I think, really liked talking to you

-and Carly loved you, so, yeah.   -Cool, cool

I wasn't sure.

'cause I don't always read people great, so...

Yeah, no, it's good. You're good

Yeah, you've hit the A team

and so, now I think we should build your profile

with the op-ed narcissists and the Beltway psychos

-All right. Bang... I like this.   -Yeah. Sure. Yeah.

You know, I thought these people would be very complicated

but it's... they're not.

It's basically just, like, money and gossip

-That's it.   -Oh, yeah. No, that's all it is.

Just money and gossip

All right.   -That's everything

All right. Well, take me down to the paradise city

Let's do this.   -Great. Well

At this point, I think I would like to ask the question

not that I don't love heaving you around

like a great lump of pine and making you shine...

But...

what have you done for me lately?

Okay, well...

What do you want?

I... I really like talking to you, so you can have...

you can have whatever you want.

Okay, so, this situation's not without risk for me.

So, if I was Tomove to actively engage

in assisting you with the acquisition

then I would need to know

that it leads to a very, very, very significant role

Three verys.

-Yeah.   -Okay, okay

Carry on.

So, I know the company

I know everything, I know my way around

I'm collaborative, I have the name

I am... I'm hot shit and I'm ready to go, okay?

Okay.

Can I think?   -No

All right.

Okay. I...

But I would hate to lose you, so... so let's.

Why don't we circle back in a bit?

-Okay?   -Yeah. Sure. Of course

-Yeah.   -Yeah.

You are doing good out there.   -All right

You're like a self-teaching A I

I'm just gonna take five

and then I'll be back with the dipshit s and limp dicks

Yeah. Sure

Boney Maroney

-What's up?   -Can you lend a hand?

Mats son. Can you, like, look after him?

Yeah, I guess he occasionally has expressed a distaste in the past for...

my particular flavor of me

Just find him a blunt. Or something stronger.

Point his dick in the direction of some fissile material, yeah?

-Yeah. Okay. I can try.   -You got it.

So, Tom, are you going to imperil democracy tomorrow?

Yeah, " You against the wall, you against the wall.

You're a nice guy. You can live." Bang.

Oh, yeah. Come on, please.   -That's what I'll do

I can assure you, Mr. Mild here is a one-pepper menu item.

Thank you, dear.

And plans after the deal goes through?

I hear you may be headed elsewhere.

Oh, well, you know, always got options.

Why? What did yoUhear?

Well, maybe I heard wrong

Sorry. Excuse me, Scott

That is some top-shelf rat fucking there

Yeah. Bye-bye

Got something juicy?   -Yeah, there's... On Mats son.

It's pretty juicy.

Apparently, he's been creeping on Ebba, his comms

sending her some weird shit

Blood, bits of hair.

-Perhaps some other things.   -Num.

Nate. Hey, Nate.   -Yeah...

You want in on this?   -You're gonna want in on this

Nate, you wanna hear something nasty about someone terrible?

Mats son's shit.   -Sure. I gotta go

-You going?   -Yeah.

Okay, but we're good on the... situation?

Daniel's people aren't too comfortable

with me rubbing shoulders with you

And, you know, Coop.

likes to yap, and

Yeah, it looks a little cozy, so...

Apologies.   -Okay, but.

you know, I think there is something here

These legitimate concerns

You just tell Daniel, I mean...

we can make primetime safe for you

All we need is one sentence...   -I'm gonna be straight with you

-signaling to the markets.   -I don't feel comfortable

with the tenor of this conversation

You don't feel comfortable with the tenor of this conversation?

Don't play hall monitor with me, bro.

Right? I know you.

I know who you are, my friend.   -Ken.

I don't know what you think this is

I'm not Gil, and you're not Logan.

That's a good thing

I'll see you.

And so, where would we live, exactly, in Oman?

In Muscat, I should think. In a compound

Okay, but would it be above ground?

Of course, above ground, Willa.

Pearl of Arabia.

Okay.

" The sultan's word has the force of the law."

Great.   -The airport, we walk right through

And this is for Mencken?

You know, all my family and friends hate Mencken.

Diplomatic plates.

You can park anywhere.

You can basically drive on the sidewalk

-The police can't touch you.   -Running people over is not a selling point.

-Fucking Greg.   -Hey.

-Hey.   -My Swedish friends

Nice to see you.

Fucking hanger-on.

Fucking dingleberry

Dude, I'm on a charm offensive here

Can you be kind?

Would you like to join us?

Would you like to fuck off?

Oh, my god.

I'm serious, Oskar. I'm gonna fire you

Okay, Ebba. Could you fire him, please?

Can you?

Oh, I'm sorry, is this boring you?

I've seen him cut your balls a hundred times.

Yeah, it's a little bit boring

But look at him. Sadistic face. He loves it

-I do.   -He loves being fired

I would... I would like to fire Ebba, though

-Yeah?   -Yeah

But I can't because she's

created and fostered this situation

in which I find it very difficult to do what I want.

I'm not saying you've done it on purpose

but it is quite interesting...

that you have sort of tenure.

Because we mingled.   -Lukas.

Ebba.

I'm not sure if you're kidding, but...

I could help.

I'd fire her if you want.

Yeah?   -Yeah.

I'd fire her right now.

I've got some recent experience in this arena

Would you do that for me?

Instantly. Sure.

It's on. Guys.

Guys, gather around

This guy is about to fire my senior comms.

No hard feelings.   -The jokes are funny.

The jokes are very funny

Ebba. Come on.

You know what, Lukas?

I wish you would fire me.

Ebba.

-Ebba! -Ebba!

It's not the attitude of the employee that we want at our company

You okay?

-Hi.   -We just... We saw...

You know, we just wanted Tomake sure.

Check in, make sure you're okay. Like, on a human level

-We... We saw...   -Yeah.

Yeah? Like, are you... you good?

I'm really... I'm totally fine. Don't worry about it

All right, well, good. That's good to hear.

Yeah...

Totally.   -He seems kind of awful

We...

You know, we... we built his whole rep

He's not even a real coder

Someone gave him, like, a box of tech

and he took it Tomarket, you know

-Bravo.   -Yeah, bravo

Well, yeah, we just wanted to say we sympathize with all the shit

Yeah, well, I'll be out in February anyway, so.

Really? That's a shame

And... is that because of the...

Sending you of, you know... whatnots?

What... No.

I mean... That's pretty much the least of his worries right now

Okay. All right. Because?

-India.   -India. Right

And I feel like I know this

but what are the details here with that?

The details? Oh, yeah

I... I'm gonna give you all the details, sure.

Right.

Can I get a... Can I bum a smoke?

Yeah.   -Thank you

Sure.

So, ATN is saying

'Dems'positive polls a radical misinformation plot."

Ballsy.   -Like to keep things peppery

I mean, did we mention he's tired?

Yeah.

I guess he can't be across everything.

Can you, tired boy? Hey?

But you should call Pam on that

'cause, you know, everyone here's needling me

Then you should tell them to stop wetting their pants

Okay, well, I get that, Tom.

But also, yoUheard about the Phoenix thing?

The O'Malleys firebombed a fucking campaign office.

Scary shit.   -A firecracker

A pair of firecrackers taped together.   -Pardon. I'm sorry

May we borrow your lady -Sure

for a second?   -Oh, sure. Don't mind me.

Guess what?   -What, the Phoenix thing?

It's pretty wild.

Nope. Mats son's numbers are funky

Sorry, what the fuck are you talking about?

Yeah, Ebba spilled. Screwy metrics in India

Mats son has been peddling bundles of South Asian packing peanuts

What? You mean, like...

Okay, so, significant numbers?

Yeah, yeah. We think so. Big, big

I fucking knew he was a bullshitter

I'm telling you. New money.

You gotta hold those fresh bills to the light

Okay.

-Fuck.   -Yeah

You said a hundred scalps in three days?

A hundred.   -Mr. Nephew, that's.

That's quite a number. I.

I thought you were backwash at the bottom of the gene pool

but this is something else.

Yes, you underestimated me, and that's exactly

-how I wanted it, Lukas.   -I believe I might have.

Well, how did you do it?

I don't know, I just do it

Just jackknife right in there...

Yeah.   -and slit their throat

It must feel, afterwards, a bit... a little bit shitty, right?

Honestly, not really

HR say s I'm the right guy for the job

'cause it looks like I care, but I don't

Not a good person.

No, I am, I am. It's just...

You gotta do what you gotta do, right?

Do you, though?

Hey, there she is.   -Hey

-Hey.   -Welcome to the kids'table

Can I talk to you for a second?

Oh, yeah, is it time to up the periscope?

Yeah, sorry to break up the brains trust.

You sit still. I'll be right back

A butcher with a smile

What's...

Why... Why are we running? Is there a fire or what?

Yeah, there might be.

So, what's your... What's happening with your numbers?

-What numbers?   -" What numbers?" Lukas.

In... Oh, in India?

Yeah.

Is this Ebba or Oskar?

Okay.

Well, we... have a...

There's a little issue that we're looking into

with subscriber numbers being... being bullshit

Well, not bullshit, but.

a little... a little bit bullshit

What does a little bit bullshit mean?

Well, maybe we discovered a metrics error

that has overstated our subs in India

Like, by quite a... Like, if there were two Indias, it would make sense.

You may be discovered?

Yeah, but there isn't two Indias. There's only one India

No. Yeah.   -And it's...

It's just a long story, but it's, like, you know...

It's an emerging market. It's... It's all wet cement. It's...

So, stock and cash deal

the board would be well within their rights to pull out

You know... You know that, obviously

So, how are you... Were you...

When are you addressing?

Like, how are yoUhandling?

I'm not gonna... I don't...

I don't want some foreign monkeys just... shorting me.

I don't... I don't like when people get inTome.

It's gonna get out eventually

Well, or we buy Waystar and it gets lost in the deal dazzle.

SEC, DOJ... Is this...

Is this even legal?   -We close quickly

and then shit will get crazy good

By next quarter, the numbers will be real, probably

Come on, it's... it's kind of funny, though, isn't it?

I... I know it's... I know it's pretty bad

I know it's pretty bad

Yeah.

You can fix it, though, right?

Oh, yeah, sure.   -Right?

I'l I just build another fucking India

Love that. Build another India

Yeah. That's my girl

Fuck me.

Hey, Gerri.

Let me guess, " I'll have a martini."

Can we chat about stuff?

I have some thoughts I might need your advice

No.

'No?" Just no?

Gerri...

What?

The thing, that wasn't.

The firing you thing, that wasn't real

-No?   -No

Not... It was, like, in the heat of the... you know?

You know.   -No.

No. Okay. Well, come on.

Let's... Let's have a fuckin'chat, okay?

I'll stand in a cupboard and jerk off

while you explain Tome what the SEC is, okay?

Oh, really? No? Too soon?

What do you want? Do you want, like, a sorry?

I got a whole purse full of sor ries

-I'm sorry.   -I'm out

I'm done.   -Bullshit

Dad fired people all the time

I was just feeling kind of fire-ish.

Look, I have some requirements you should know about.

Several of which have been officially communicated

and some that I thought I should, you know

say in person.   -Okay.

Robo-Gerri. Scary.   -First of all, I want money.

Eye-watering sums. Hundreds of millions of dollars

No. Pass.

So, I have retained personal reputation management

and they will be on the line

when Karolina does her background briefings

off a set of my bullet points.

I would set off your bullet points

And if I ever get a whiff of anything undermining my narrative

any time in the next five years

I will sue and I will go public

-with those many, many pictures -This is so stupid.

of your genitalia -All right

that I have in my possession.   -Great.

Have I made myself clear?   -Yes, absolutely

It's been a pleasure working with you, Gerri, thanks.

I could have got you there.

But no

-Nope.   -Nope.

See you.

Con, can we... Can we settle this now?

Everyone is quite freaked out

about this political firebombing in Arizona

Oh, yeah, the pop-pop s in Phoenix?

-Yeah.   -The wastepaper basket on fire?

I think a file cabinet was in the ICU

-Can we draft?   -Well, actually, there's been a...

slight change of heart.   -Get the fuck out of here

You got it. You got your bauble. It's great

Let's write up a fucking statement, okay?

Wind up the old fax machine

and fart it out to your oddball army, okay?

We wonder, Roman, if he might have

invested too much in his campaign to just, you know, drop out now

Yeah.   -That's so cool

You tried, you failed, you move on, find something new.

He's fought hard

and we wanna find out what might happen, okay?

-He might write, you know, a book about this

Or a speaker circuit or.

Hey. Nothing is gonna happen, okay?

Anything might happen tomorrow, actually

Really? Anything?   -Yeah.

You see, because that's the beauty

of this little system that we have called democracy.

Con, man. Eat the fucking carrot, okay?

Everyone in this room thinks you're a fucking joke.

So, tell your "wife " to shut the fuck up, cover her shoulders

and pack a fucking bag for Oman, okay?   -Rom, Rom.

I'm talking here. It's okay

Easy.

There's one person here who doesn't think I'm a joke

So, that's who I'm gonna listen to, okay?

That's smart. Yeah, listen to her

-Will a, honey.   -Yeah.

Bye. Nice to meet you

A pleasure, sir. You got my vote. A hundred percent.

I'm trying to help you, man. I am trying to help you

Really nice party.

Cool, cool family

Oh, thanks, man. Tweet about it.

So, who's... who's going out tonight in this shitty fuckin'town?

Anyone?

I gotta say, it's pretty depressing from up here

You can really see how second world it is.

I don't know. Pretty happening town, famously

-Really? Is it, though?   -Yeah.

Compared to Singapore or Seoul?

It's like Legoland.

You know we still run shit, though?

Like as in only in New York

-Yeah.   -Right. Okay.

Well, nothing happens in New York if it doesn't happen everywhere.

You should get that written on a cup, right?

Shouldn't he get that written on a cup?

Like, that would look so cool

He could sell that in a... in a head shop in Rotterdam

Could be a... a good business for you.

'Cause I hear you might need some new revenue streams.

Yeah. Hey, really, really good presentation, by the way

Loved it.

Can't wait to get into those predictions, man.

Those meaty predictions.   -Oh, yeah?

Yes. Gonna be fun.   -Yeah, yeah?

I'm excited about that. Estimates. You know, estimates

-Yeah.   -But you, man

Your numbers exploding, right?

Like, literally unbelievable

Well, thank you, thank you

And congrats to you as well

Cause I hear your numbers are gay

My numbers are what?   -Gay

-My numbers are gay?   -Yeah

You had this cute little valuation

and your numbers just came out as gay

That's kind of homophobic, man.

Dude, just let the wave hit you.

Float out

I think I am the wave, though, actually

You think you are the wave?

Because you love the deal?

Are you kidding? Biggest overpay in history

-Love that shit.   -Okay

Love it. Love the deal.   -All right, well.

Love the deal.   -Love the deal.

Love it.   -Come on. Come on, brother

Love the deal, yeah.

Yes.

-All right.   -Love the deal

Love the deal, love the deal

The fuck? Bit of a show.

Hugging it out.

Hey, I'm going to...   -What?

Yea h. I'm done. I'm...

I'm going to be d. I'm bushwhacked

My eyes look sand papered.

Okay, well, you can stay up for just a little longer

and say goodnight to people together

Shiv, do you know what my day looks like tomorrow?

Tom, you're not gonna be doing anything

You're just gonna be looking for shiny foreheads

It's fine, you can stay for 45 minutes more.

I'm just a little tired

because all the fun gossip that I've been hearing from everywhere

at this party in my house

is that I'm gonna be shit canned

I got faith in you, man.

-You've always been a loyal servant.   -Lots of faith

Sorry.

Not helpful.

The fuck is wrong with you?

I just really do need to get some sleep

I really do. I'm sorry. Can we just leave it there?

You're ti red. I get it.   -Please forget it

You keep on fucking saying

So yeah, you're tired.   -Okay, okay. I'm tired

-Let's leave it there. Okay.   -You keep fucking telling everyone

Okay, I'll stop.   -You're ti red. I get it

I'm sorry. I'm just...

You know, I am just worried about.

You know, maybe I've nailed myself to the Mats son cross

and he might turn out to be bullshit

You know, he's erratic and... you know, maybe he isn't real

Shiv, he's real. He's the future.

No, Tom. He...

There is a time bomb in his numbers, and I might get blown up.

You'll be fine.

You'll always be fine.

No. No, I am fucking my family for this

Can I just say something?

At this party here

there are may be 40 of the most important people in America

and you have just walked all around all evening

telling them all that I'm gonna get fired

No, it was implied, lightly, as a little.

part of a tactical kind of joke.

Will you explain Tome?

The joke? Because I don't get...   -Oh, my god

the fucking joke.   -Tom.

-I don't get the joke.   -It was something that he said

that isn't true, that we needed to say

But you stood by his side, and he said it

and you were like, " Okay. Well, that sounds good Tome."

Fuck's sake. I'm not doing this right now

You know, I am in serious trouble. That was a play

You will be okay

because you are a tough fuckin' bitch

who will always survive

because you do what you need

-You will do what...   -Are you even listening?

-I'll be okay?   -You will do whatever you need

-Yeah? Really?   -Yeah

You sure you're not projecting? Because that is actually you.

Should we have a real conversation?

-With a scorpion? No.   -That was a friendly thing

-Oh, yeah, sure.   -That was a friendly thing

You're real friendly

Yeah, no, I'm a scorpion

You're a hyena. You're a... you're a street rat.

Actually, no, you're a fucking snake

Here is a dead snake to wear as a necktie, Tom.

Why aren't you laughing?

I wonder if we shouldn't clear the air

-Yeah? Oh, sure.   -Yeah

I think that you can be a very selfish person

and I think you find it very hard to think about me.

-What the fuck?   -And I think

you shouldn't have even married me, actually

What the fuck?   -Yeah.

What the actual fuck? You proposed Tome

You proposed Tome at my lowest fucking ebb

My dad was dying. What was I supposed to say?

Perhaps no?

I didn't wanna hurt your feelings

Oh, thanks. Thanks for that

Yeah, you really kept me safe

while you ran off to fuck the phone book

Oh, fuck off. You're a hick.

-And then... And then...   -A conservative hick

yoUhid it because you were so scared

of how fucking awful you are

You were only with me to get to power

Well, you got it now, Tom. You've got it.

I'm with you because I love you!

Bullshit! You're fucking me for my DNA

You were fucking me for a fucking ladder

because your whole family is striving and parochial

That's not... that's not a fair characterization.

Oh, no? Well, your mom loves me more than she loves you

Because she's cracked

You wanna... you wanna actually clear the air?

Fine. You betrayed me

You were going to see me

get sent to fucking prison, Shiv!

And then you fobbed me off with that fucking undrinkable wine

and you won't have my baby

because you never even thought honestly

that you'd be with me more than, like, four fucking years, I don't think

You offered to go to jail, Tom.

You offered because you're servile

You just... you're servile

You are incapable of thinking about anybody other than yourself

cause your sense of who you are, Shiv

-is that fucking thin.   -Oh, yeah?

Yeah.   -You read that in a book, Tom?

You're too fucking transparent to find in a book

You're pathetic, you're pathetic

You're a masochist, and you can't even take it.

I think you are incapable of love.

And I think you are maybe not

a good person to have children.

Well, that's not very nice to say, is it?

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but you...

You have hurt me more than you can possibly imagine

And you.

you took away the last six months I could've had with my dad

-No.   -Yes

You sucked up to him and you cut me out.

It's not my fault

that you didn't get his approval

I have given you endless approval

and it doesn't fill you up because you're broken.

I don't like you.

I don't...

I don't even care about you

I don't care.

Have we cleared the air, huh?

Feel good now?

-Yeah.   -Yeah.

Fucking great. Tip top

You don't deserve me.

And you never did

And everything came out of that.

So fucking flat.

You find ways to have fun out there?

More or less.

The red wine smells like wet dog

Listen, I just wanted to do five

Just me and you, just Frankie and Kenny

Not CEO and Chair.

No helms.   -Yeah.

I don't think the GoJo deal

is in the best interests of the shareholders

and I would like to explore ways of blocking it

I don't want to hear it, Ken.

What if I told you

his subs in India are significantly inflated?

I'm just gonna hit you with this

What if we run it all the way back?

Do I even wanna know what that means?

We go reverse Viking.

We pillage their village

Way star acquires GoJo

It... There would have to be major issues

There are.

But if we could slow this down

and we eat Mats son's lunch

bigger than Dad ever was

Roman and Shiv?   -Yeah, I don't know.

Part of my plans.

I love them, but not in love with them, you know?

One head, one crown.

But I'll need ballast

Are you with me?

Hi, everyone. Hi.

Bedtime for Bonzo

Sorry, but please get the fuck out of my house now.

Yeah, no... Please.

Party's over 'cause I've gotta sleep

It's been a terrific night. Thank you so much

No, I'm serious.

Off you go. Go to bed

Enjoy your beds. Go home. Cry

I'm done, I'm done.

I can barely stand, but I've had enough

Good night.

Good night, Tom.   -Don't forget your coats

-Fuck Tom.   -Yeah. Fuck Tom.

Fuck Tom.

So, guys...

Funeral, if nobody wants to grab it

I'm happy to take the big energy spot.

Yeah?   -Yeah.

Yeah, I mean, it seems like nobody wanted it.

So, I got it. Yeah?

Sure. It's fine. Knock yourself out

Just paint it red

Yeah? Happy?   -Yeah.

Yeah, happy?   -Happy

Happy

Happy, happy headbangers.

Here we are. Okay.

Good night.   -Good night

Night.
