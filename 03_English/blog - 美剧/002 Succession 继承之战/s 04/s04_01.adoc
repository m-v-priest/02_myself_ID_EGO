Hey! -Hi, how are you? Good to see you.

Here he is.

Looks good in there, huh?

Happy birthday, Pa!

Let's move on and put this in the " No" Pile.

Can you tell me your idea with this one?

Just so I know what the thinking was behind this branding

Romey!

Where are you. Dude?

It's my brother. He's coming

Let's put a pin in this one and move on.

Let a thousand sunflowers bloom, Romey

I wanna start a business with you. Brother.

-'Sup, T? -This is nothing. No.

Right, fuck chops? -Hey, guys! How are we looking?

This is one that we feel could work across every vertical…

-No. -That's a hard no.

In terms of what we need for our new venture, The Hundred

-They're... They're shitty.

They're shitty. We can just be honest here, right?

The Hundred is Sub stack meets Masterclass

meets The Economist meets The New Yorker.

I feel like we said " Iconic "

and you guys are leaning " Ironic "

Hey, T? I think the money is here

Rome, I think your security are being very weird with them.

They seem stupid and probably racist.

Well, you look tired, and your face is giving me a headache.

-Thank you. -So, where have you been, sis?

What do you mean? Hey!

Where have you been?

It was traffic. And a call. Business. For this

Guys, this is good feedback.

We're gonna circle back on

exactly all that stuff and we'll talk soon

See you later.

So, traffic? Huh?

Yeah, traffic. What?

Shivy, are you snaking?

We hear that you've been talking to the Jimenez transition team.

-Well, no. -No?

No.

So it's lies that our friend told us?

They're lying to us?

I've talked to them, but it's because I'm helping them out

as you already know.

So you are talking?

No.

I returned a call. They wanna talk about talking.

They wanna talk about talking?

What? Come on.

They haven't won the election, and they might not

and Dad might not sell,

and you two might bail

and it's a may be, may be, may be situation

Dad is obviously selling

We're looking at fucking logos here.

I drafted a resignation statement from Waystar

Yeah, same.

This is just a big step, and so, can't we keep some options?

Keep options open? We're two days out from Dad selling

Here's what you have to understand

I've smoked horse

He's scared of needle s. He's not a real junkie

I need something super fucking absorbing in my life

And if it isn't gonna be this, please just let me know, right?

I feel like I've been flying around the country

having serious fucking conversations with serious people,

expending serious personal capital

and getting big fucking names on board.

-Same. Me, too. -So we've all been doing that.

Are you worried that this is may be too small scale?

What? No. No, do you?

Me? No

My only worry with The Hundred is it literally too good?

Like, why hasn't anyone done this before?

I am in.

I'm in. I am.

Okay.

Happy birthday to you!

Happy birthday, dear Logan!

Happy birthday to you!

Jesus fucking Christ!

You okay, Loge?

Munsters. Meet the fucking Munsters

Who the fuck is this now?

-So, I guess we should... -Hi! Welcome!

Welcome, Greg and... -This is Bridget.

Bridget, this is Kerry. Logan's.

Friend, assistant, and advisor.

Hey, I'm Bridget. -Hi, Bridget. So great to meet you.

Greg, let me and you grab Bridget a drink

Okay. So, excuse us, Bridget

I'm sorry. We'll be right back

Make yourself at home.

Who is this, Greg? -That's my date

Right, but who is she?

I brought a date. That's okay, right?

What's her name? What's her full name?

Is it Random-fuck? Bridget Random-fuck?

Is she from the apps, Greg?

I really like her. I might have fallen for her.

That's great. How many previous dates have you had?

Kerry, I'm not sure this is appropriate

We're not a fucking Shake Shack, Greg

This isn't a pre-fuck party. It's a birthday party

I am a cousin. I get a plus one

I'm like an honorary kid

You're an honorary kid? --Yeah

-Marcia once said... -Marcia's not here.

She's in Milan, shopping. Forever.

You do know that

we're in the middle of a hotly-contested election,

your uncle is on the brink of a very large sale

and scoping out a very sensitive acquisition?

Are you certain that she's not

gonna leak details right before the board meeting?

Do you know she's not a hostile corporate asset?

Okay. So, we're looking for investment partners

for a revolutionary, new media brand

that's gonna redefine news for the 21st century

It's an indispensable, bespoke information hub.

" The Hundred, greatest experts, best writers,"

" Top minds in every field, from Israel-Palestine to A I "

To Michelin restaurants.

One-stop info shop, high-calorie info snacks "

Sorry. I'm gonna take this

All right, take it.

-Hello? -Hey. How are you?

Good. How are you? What is it?

I was just calling to give you a heads up

and just to say hi

and just to let you know that I just had a little drink

with Naomi Pierce last night

Just in case of anything, I just wanted to inform you

I'm sorry, you're informing me?

I just wanted to perform the ask out of due deference

just in case of photos or getting talked about

I'm sorry, you're asking me or you're informing me?

Shiv, it's not a thing.

Then why are you letting me know?

Because it's not business. But it is..

It's fine. You're dating my brother's ex.

It's fine.

Shiv, no. It's social.

It's not a sexual thing.

So there's nothing I need to tell you about

And yet, you're telling me

Because I bumped into Mar linda, okay?

And of course, she got her little beak in.

so I had to tell her it wasn't business because she asked

So, the headline is there's nothing to worry about. Okay?

It's fine, it's all fucking fine.

Seriously. Knock yourself out

Go fucking nail her in the coat check. I don't care.

The kid from St. Paul has really made it.

I just thought under the term what we agreed

this was something worth discussing

You don't discuss something.

Tom, that's already fucking happening

You don't say " Shiv, do you mind,"

" Naomi and I are at the Pierre and I'm inside her."

-" Would you mind if I ejaculate?" -Whatever.

Fine. Hey, look. I saw from the calendar update

you're back in the city tonight? -Yeah

So, why the fuck are you meeting with her? What's going on?

Take care, Shiv.

It's like a private members'club, but for everyone

It is click bait in a way, but for smart people.

We have the ethos of a non-profit

but a path to crazy margins. Shiv, you okay?

-Yeah. -You sure?

It's fine, I'm fine.

It's just, you know.

Tom's apparently out with Naomi Pierce.

Did you know about this?

What? No.

Where are you at with her? -I don't know.

Like carnival of mind fuck. We have n't really talked

Well, apparently she's fucking Tom now.

Can I go get them?

Yea h. I'm fine. I'm actually fine.

He's not..

It was just a meeting, apparently

so it's fine. Let's do this

Yeah? Do you think they can just give us two?

I mean, it's fine, but they just got off a long flight

Tell'em they can shove their petrodollars

up their human rights record. We need to talk to our sister.

They're fine. They love it.

Just find them a journalist

to burn with cigarettes while they wait

Shi v, is it a date?

I don't know.

It probably isn't, but..

I mean, Naomi Pierce.

Dad?

With Dad? You think what?

I got sent this from my team

Apparently Bun Pierce has

been tagged on some girl's In sta at Dad's

-At Dad's? -At the birthday

Okay. Well, board meeting imminent.

He sells up, but with A TN spun off?

What? He's lining up a Pierce acquisition

to add to his little fucking ATM rump?

-I guess. -Or it could just be a brain fuck

Dad twisting our turnips, playing the old fuck trombone.

Set Tom and Nay up to just torture us.

Set them up to torture us?

I mean, he's a sociopath, but he wouldn't be a good torturer.

Not'cause he doesn't have the stomach

he just doesn't have the patience

I'm gonna call Nay.

Telly? -Yeah?

Telly, jelly, belly, one query.

Pierce, PGN. What's the vibes, YOLO, rumba tron?

Are they in play?

I know they're always open to offers

and the sale contingent on the trust is itchy, I believe.

Should I call Nab by through?

Five more. Please. Just give us five.

Okay, yeah.

Hey. You okay, Con?

Yeah. Just polling

Ten days out... -What are you AT Now?

Solid. Still holding. -Yeah, one percent

It's just the fear is, in these last days... it could get squeezed.

Squeezed down?

From one?'Cause that's the lowest number

No. There's decimals

They're saying that I could need to get aggressive

in certain media markets

because both sides are trying to squeeze my percent

That's greedy, knowing they have all the other percents

I know, but then...

It gets awfully spendy to get aggressive

Like, how much?

Like another hundred mil

One hundred million? Damn!

So, what would you get for that? Could you win?

Good Lord, no.

No. That won't move the needle

The hope is that would maintain my percent

And for your percent you get...?

He gets a place in the conversation.

Which is great,'cause conversation's important to be inside of.

But it is kind of a lot. Right, Will?

A hundred million? Yeah

But if you spent it, you'd still be like rich.

Sure, yeah.

Nevertheless, like, minus a hundred million

When it comes to this new venture with GoJo,

and if you talk to Mats son, consider it..

Right. Thank you.

So.

-Looks good. -We squared away on this?

Got the structure, got the landing zone.

Naomi thinks that Nan has lost all interest in business

The left are going after them now.

Savages. They eat their own.

The cousins want out.

So, I think, a last push on price may be..

Little tummy tickle on culture

And Naomi's flown out to reassure.

This is it. You landed the plane, Logan

48 hours and out. Congratulations!

Have you heard from the rats?

Shiv? No.

Good

One thing has been on my mind though, sir.

Yes.

With one thing and another, I'm sure we'll iron it all out

but the rocky, old road of life

and the wife part of that can be a difficult part of it

As you know.

Not to comment.

just to say it would be great to get your take

Hopefully, it won't come to that, but..

In the end, if there is just too much emotional shrapnel.

I wondered what your view would be.

Not that you necessarily need to have one,

but what would happen were a marriage, such as mine

even in fact mine.

if that were to falter to the point of failure?

-If you and Shiv were to bust up? -Right

I guess, Shiv and I have had this experiment,

this trial separation

but whatever happens, we'll always be good, right?

If we're good, we're good.

Okay. Well, that's heartening.

That's heartening

I'm heartened by that. That's great

Kerry! Where's the grub?

Tom's going off his nut here.

So, you two are thinking we should be buying Pierce, huh?

Because that's obviously

what you're thinking, and let me just say.

that's quite the fucking pivot!

Right. You may be thinking, " What about The Hundred?"

May be, fuck The Hundred?

Fuck The Hundred, Shiv?

After Dubai, you were high as shit on it.

It was basically your idea.

-I love it. I do. -You do?

Yes, but can't we do both?

Can't we do both?

Let's launch a high-visibility execution-dependent

disruptor news brand

while simultaneously performing CPR on a fucking corpse

of a legacy media conglomerate.

Should we ask Tell is?

Yes. Let's ask Tellis. I wonder what he's gonna say.

" Hey, Telly. Would you rather

five million in fees from a funding round "

" Or 35 million from an acquisition?"

I thought we were going for The Hundred

Small, new, fast on our feet

-Are you scared of fighting Dad? -No, Ken.

That's getting fucking old

You spent the last three months

hunting down contributors, backers, right?

Working your fucking ass off. -I don't have a view.

All I would say is, maybe it's worth the conversation, all right?

It is our wheelhouse.

It's a Daimler that's been in the barn for 20 years

Clear the chicken shit off that thing, fucking may be

Okay. But can we even afford it?

Yeah, I mean, what, it's... it's half now,

So that's, like, eight, nine bil.

And after the GoJo sale, we'll have 2-3 bil.

So, yeah, that's our nut.

If we partner up with our name with these fucks here.

some other pieces of shit, our experience

Shiv the yummy dummy Dem my

my profile as the fearless fighter of the good fight

you as the dirty little fucker pushing the filth buttons.

Yeah, new gen Roys. We have a fucking song to sing

I mean, as a business it's much better

than the made-up company of dreams we were ready to pitch

Fuck you! You loved it!

I do. It's very exciting. But it's kind a bullshit.

Rome, it is. I wanna do something.

We have a seminal election about to happen

and it's fucking 1933, and I wanna have a say

It makes sense, Rome,

to start an empire with an established brand.

At least rule it out.

Dis gustibus!

I hear you've made an enormous faux pas

and everyone's laughing up their sleeves about your date

What? Why?

Why? Because she's brought a ludicrously capacious bag

What's even in there?

Flat shoes for the subway?

Her lunch pail? Greg, it's monstrous.

It's gargantuan. You could take it camping.

You could slide it across the floor after a bank job

Well, whatever. She's another tick on the chart.

The Disgusting Brothers

Don't call us that. It was heavily iron ized, Greg

Okay. I'm kidding. I really do like her.

Well, she's used all the display towels in the bathroom

and now they're sopping wet

She's gab bling about herself and posting it on social media.

She's asking people personal questions

and she's wolfing all the canapes like a famished warthog

People are overreacting.

She brought a normal sort of handbag

You are a laughingstock in polite society

You'll never go to the opera again. -Maybe we should go

Are you okay? What happened?

Nothing. I just asked Logan for a self ie.

You asked Logan for a self ie? -Yeah.

I said " Congrats on the big deal'

I was like " K ar-ching", am I right?

I was being funny.

So I'm in touch with their bankers

Nan thinks she's honor bound to another buyer

Did she say no? -No

But they're close to agreeing the outlines of a deal.

There's not a ton of interest, managing the family's a nightmare

so they're looking for a preferred bidder to run a bilateral.

She wants to lock in that preferred bidder tonight

So, she didn't think it could work. But she did say

She could speak to you, Shiv.

Okay. Well, should I at least call?

Just check in at Grey Gardens

and go, you know, mano a Nan-o?

Just see if there's anything there at all?

Work your magic.

You good? It's nice, huh?

Yeah. Little piggies stuffing their mouths.

Why is everybody so fucking happy?

Logan…

You okay? -Yeah

I got done a huge fucking deal in exactly the right time.

I got A TN, plus Pierce.

I got the election. I got plenty on my plate

Sure.

I thought there might be a churchman.

U h, I'm sorry?

A cardinal was mentioned. Bit of fucking class

What about Jeryd?

Mencken? I think that he hopes to, but realistically..

But I think that he hopes to. But Gillian is here.

Oh, who op-de-doop

Do you want me to be in touch with the kids?

When is she calling?

Nan, I think she just wants to talk to her whole gang

Listen, I'm not gonna sit like a cunt.

waiting for that old crone.

The man of the hour!

Colin!

-You all right? -Yeah. Let's get out of here.

So it is Dad. Confirmed

Yeah. Man, she's a complicated woman.

She's like, " I'm honor bound, my mind is made up.

" But also, how soon can we be there?"

Fuck her! -What do you think?

I thinks he hates Dad

But also thinks we're fake fruit for display purposes only

I don't know.

Can we tell her to fuck off?

Maybe not go back to the mat with Dad.

You know, back in that fucking room..

Shall we cards on the table? -Yeah

-I do like Pierce. -Agreed

-Fuck's sake! -Rome, it makes sense.

We wanted to do something together

and we know news, entertainment

and this is off the shelf.

So, I guess until now,

you've just sort of been stringing us along?

-No. -I like the other shit, I do.

You know, I like this, I really do.

And besides, everything else might fall apart.

He might go on a killing spree in 7-Eleven,

and you might get your dick stuck in an AI jerk machine.

I have to look after myself because nobody else will

I like this.

So, you wanna fly there.

like Nan Pierce's little Windsor Dog Show bitch?

-It's just a checkout. -Yeah.

Fuck! Shit!

I'm worried, I guess

Like you wanna fuck Dad. You wanna fuck Tom.

I'm the only one who wants to set up a business as a business

and doesn't wanna fuck anyone.

Rome, this acquisition would be nothing to do with Dad

It's completely unrelated. -Don't believe you

Seriously. -Seriously don't believe you.

Okay, well, this is not about getting back at Dad.

but if it hurts him. It doesn't bother me.

I think that you don't wanna

do this'cause you're scared of conflict.

Honestly, Rome, being rational.

putting aside the internecine family concerns

the personal tittle tattle,

just think about how fucking funny it would be if we screw Dad

over his decades-long obsession

You're a good guy.

-Thank you, sir. -You're my pal

Thank you.

-You're my best pal. -Thank you.

I mean, what are people?

Right.

What are people?

They're economic units. I'm a hundred feet tall

These people are pygmies.

But together, they form a market

Okay. Right.

What is a person? It has values and aims,

but it operates in a market

Marriage market, job market,

money market, market for ideas, et cetera.

So, everything is a market?

Everything I try to do people turn against me

Nothing tastes like it used to, does it?

Nothing is the same as it was.

You think there's anything after all this? Afterwards?

I don't know.

I don't think so.

I think this is it, right?

May be

My Dad is very religious.

But realistically though?

-I don't know. --And that's it.

We don't know. We can't know.

But I've got my suspicions.

I've got my fucking suspicions.

Lookie here! Pardon me!

Hello, Kerry! And how are we today?

Hi! Can you hear me? The line is a little bit..

Sort of. We're in transit. Can you hear me?

You'd be able to hear her better

if she took Dad's cock out of her mouth.

What's that?

That was my sister saying that we would hear you better

if you took Dad's cock out of your mouth

So. My question was, would you consider giving him a call?

Would we consider at least a call?

Well, is he apologizing?

Did he ask?

He...

I know that he would love to hear from you

If he were to call, then we would see.

It's just gonna be a lot to get him to call, just knowing him

I think we know him pretty well, actually

We've never licked his big omelet nipples

I could get him to text a request for a call.

Text? I'm afraid we're gonna need to hear that voice.

You can pop it back in your mouth. We're getting on the plane.

Thanks, bye.

Dick. -Problem.

He's not picking up for me. He pick up for you?

Will. No

Excuse me, I'm sorry. Can I get through?

Hey, baby!

Listen. So, you know the wedding

I've been thinking..

Okay, like...

Is the boat special enough? Like, brainstorming..

What if we got married underneath the Statue of Liberty

with a brass band?

Get a rapper. I don't know, jet packs

confetti guns, and razor wire

and bum fights, and, you know, goody bags

And hoopla and razzmatazz. -Bum fights?

Con, you sound unhinged. What is this?

If I can get inserted into the news cycle

that's a huge savings from paid media

Right.

The wedding.

I've always... It's dumb, but I wanted a nice wedding

I'm scared, Willa

I have spent so much fucking money and it's getting scary

If I was to fall under 1%, I would become a laughing stock

Would you just consider it? Just a little bit of hoopla?

Just for the final push.

Kerry said she knows where he is.

He's coming back now. What are you smiling for?

Nothing

What?

The Disgusting Brothers on motherfucking tour.

We just did it. -What do you mean you did it?

She's a firecracker, man. She's crunchy peanut butter.

Wait. You did it? Are you serious? Where?

We were looking for the armory slash-cigar-humidor

and she pulled me into a guest bedroom

and bingo-bongo hit that bango

You actually did it? Greg.

You are fucked.

You are fucked.

Logan, he's camera'ed up the wazoo. CCTV

-Which room? -Every room. You know that

I evidently did not know that

-Are you serious? -Of course, I'm serious

And he watches it back every night with a scotch

See if anyone's stolen a butter knife.

He's gonna fucking gut you like a rainbow trout.

Fuck!

What did you do? Were the lights on?

Did you actually do it? Tell me.

We put our hands down each other's pants

And had a bit of a rummage

Did you rummage to fruition?

Can I not say?

You've accidentally made him a sex tape, Greg

Oh my God! -You need to tell him

Okay, party's over. Rival bid, let's go!

Tom, Gerri, Karl, Frank, upstairs, library

Let's flush it out.

Would you mind just giving me a sec?

Okay. Sure.

Hi!

Hi

So she's having a little wobble.

Nan? What do you mean?

She's not sure it feels right to meet you guys

But she feels terrible.

Okay. So, what do we do?

She might be getting a headache.

She wondered if you could give her five, see how it develops

Okay, sure.

Let's see how the headache develops

Okay, Jesus.

So, who's crawled out of the woodwork?

Who is it?

-What? -It's the Kids. The kids are with the Pierces.

They are the rival bidders? Butter my be an pole.

How did they pick up the scent?

A million ways. Everybody knows they're looking for suitors

Could they even get the cash together?

Couldn't Logan stop them?

If Way star is sold.

they have the right to liquidate their five percent s

You should probably tell him

Oh no. I'm very focused on the GoJo deal

This is really a side issue.

-You're such a trusted advisor. -Yeah, but I'm getting out

I don't know what the news is, and it's beyond my purview

and I'm walking away.

-Beware the blood sugar. -Well, fucking find out

-Sir, if I may have a moment. -What? What's the issue?

The rival bidder, it's probably the kids

I don't think you have anything to be concerned about

You are the solid option

Call your wife, Tom

Call your fucking wife

and tell them to get their own fucking idea

It's pathetic!

And tell her she's never

had a single fucking idea in her entire life!

-What? -No, it can wait.

What else?

It's private. Can you and I just have a moment?

Over there. -Thank you. Sir

You think she's just cooling us off?

Doing a Dad move?

No, no. Poor thing has a headache

So, she's feeling a little better.

If you like, she will see you.

All right. Get to talk to an old lady about newspapers

Amazing. Thank you so much

So how did it go?

So, he says he finds me disgusting and despicable,

but he kind of smiled

Did he? -Yeah.

What did you say?

So, I said she's a bit wild

She's quite eager

and may be she'd had a hit of the old wacky tabac ky or worse

And that I never intended to soil these halls

And maybe she's just a bit of a..

Bit of a drug-addled, cock monster

So, you blamed it on her.

You're so gallant.

So, she's gonna have to leave, okay?

Is that really necessary?

Do you have an issue with that? -No, look

Colin, I'm fond of her

but we must... each of us do as we see fit

She posted to social media.

I'm gonna have to ask to go through her phone

You wanna come explain?

Wait, sorry. You know what?

I think it is best if you go do what you have to do

I don't wanna see what happens in Guantanamo.

So you go, do your ways, and God be willing

Well, hello! Welcome!

Apologies for the kerfuffle. I have an appalling migraine.

But I can manage. How are you all, more importantly?

Great. -Great to see you.

And it's a lovely place.

It would seem that they

shred hundred-dollar notes for fertilizer.

Now, how are you all fairing in terms of your father?

We're fine. It's just a complicated, private situation

Whereby we all hate him.

Well, please sit

Look, as you probably know, we are talking with our bankers

And we have a whole number

of very interesting proposals to consider.

And I think it's all wrapped up.

So, I wanted to say thank you for coming

but I think it's just a little bit too late

We have a preferred bidder.

I hope that I have not inconvenienced you

Okay, well, lovely visit. Great to see you guys.

Really. I am very sorry

May I offer you some bottles?

They might as well be jars of jam to me.

but the connoisseurs seem to like them.

I fear I have peasant tastes.

You don't wanna just hear the offer?

I got a taste for hyper march e vin ordinaire

when I was 19 years old and I have never been able to shake it.

I like my wine thin and vinegary.

Like her men. -Naomi!

No, but really I fear it is a trip made in vain.

The other offer's just too good

Listen, long story short, Nan, you called this right before.

Logan wants to take your company and fuck it.

He loathes you

and he wants to take your properties and roll them in the dirt.

And we wouldn't do that

I think that after this election,

we all, as a country, could be in a very bad place.

We would maintain your values.

That's all good and well

but obviously, with one thing and another,

we have a responsibility

to get the best possible deal for my family

and the other shareholders

I'm confident that we can be competitive on price.

What with Jamie's divorce and Anne's disaster in Maine..

And this place..

How's your financing? Not that I understand at all

It's robust.

Tellis and our team can talk to your people.

And in terms of your futures?

Well, we've written our resignation letters

and the GoJo deal signs in 48 hours.

Nevertheless, you'd still be married to the head of ATN.

That's a bit messy. -I'm getting a divorce, so.

Oh.'Kay. I'm sorry to hear that

Yes, it's a sad, sad day when love dies

Listen, this is very confusing

And I don't want to talk numbers. It's not about the numbers.

Totally. Totally

Shall we just say our number, though?

Just see if that makes any sense

Oh, I don't like this.

Makes me feel like I'm in the middle of a bidding war.

Horrible.

Different people saying different numbers.

Eight, nine. What's next?

I know. It's so confusing. What comes after nine? Nine B?

Listen, would you mind if we all had a brief chat?

Have you seen the view from the terrace? It's incredible.

Can't be at it. -All right. We'll try

Thank you.

Thank you. Nan.

Nan is thinking.

and she wondered if she could ask for your indulgence.

It's not a money question.

So, you okay to hold on for a minute just before you talk to her?

Well, what else can I fucking say? -Okay

Hi. Yeah. We'll hold

Nobody tells jokes anymore, do they?

Karl, do you have any jokes?

What's that?

I'm saying, Karl,

it's a bit dry in here.

Do you have any jokes?

Well, let me think. -Dry as fucking dust. Come on!

Roast me! Give me a drubbing

Frank, start. Be funny

It's not really my thing, Chief

You don't think I can take it?

No, it's just not my style. I mean, I can.

The thing about Logan Roy is

The thing about Logan is he's a tough old nut.

Christ. Sid fucking Caesar. Greggy

You're mea n. You're a me an, old man.

You're a mean, old bastard, and you scare the life out of folks.

That's your thing. You're scaring me right now

And that's why I don't even know what to do

Who wants to smell Greg's finger?

Guess the scent, win a buck.

Come on! Roast me!

Where are your kids? Where's all your kids, uncle Logan?

On your big birthday. -Where's your old man?

Where's your old man? Still sucking cock at the county fair?

Gerri, been sent anything funny lately?

All a bit horrible for me. Thanks, Logan.

I'm not being horrible, I'm being fun. Fucking Munsters

Okay, very good. Hang on

So, she would like to get this figured out

in theory, at least, tonight

The uncertainty is not good

They would like us to get our best foot forward

on an indicative price tonight

No need to play nice. Should I tell her to fuck off?

-Loge? -I'm thinking

Is she talking to them? -I think so

Okay, okay, okay. Kerry, I may need input

Tell is, you there?

Hey, yeah. I think we can get that together

Okay, so were gonna go in and say eight

We're starting at eight.

But if we're going for this, let's not be hard asses

We gotta let her know that we can see upside

but she's gotta help us prove it out.

-Okay. -Hello.

Yeah, what? Yes. I'm interested. Shut up

-Okay. So should I... -Yeah, she likes you.

Yeah, eight is good. -Thanks, T.

Thanks.

-Yeah, thanks. Top notch! -Great, call you back.

Tell her what? We anchor at seven?

Not a problem

Yeah.

Not too insulting?

No. It's fine. I mean, it's insulting

but it's not like you're

wasting relationship capital. She hates you

Start at six. But like you're kidding around

Seven is what we soft-floated, right?

Six. Find something we've lost conviction on

just to let her know that

we're not Terry fucking Turnip Truck over here

Hi, Nan!

This may be hard to say for me and to tear for you..

Thank you.

Hi, Nan. So I think we're looking at.

Were very relaxed about the eight billion landing spot

This is disgusting

But thank you.

-We'l I just need a minute. -Okay.

Right.

They didn't love it.

What are they up to, do you think?

-I don't know. -I don't wanna lose this, Tommy

You wanna just jump right up? What to?

Call your wife. Call Shiv.

So, she appreciates eight

Yeah? She appreciates it? Cool.

But she wonders if there's a little more upside.

Okay

Telly.

Hello.

Eight-five. Can we... can we go there, T?

Well, I... I don't have the precise composition

of our consortium and, obviously, DD

But I know the asset and I think we can get there.

You fucking jerking it to your yacht catalogue there, T?

This is exciting, guys!

Thanks, Tell is. That's a great insight.

He's gonna bill us 200 mil for that strategy advice.

Incoming.

Hello? Tom?

Okay. He wants a discussion

What? Dad's-got To m on this? What? Was Colin not available?

-Hey, Shiv. -Fuck you, man mountain!

Hey! So look, we were just wondering

if we're not being played a little here since this is all indicative.

Okay, What did he go up to, Tom?

-I can't tell you that. -Come on, Tom, you can tell me.

Did he go to nine? He didn't go to nine, did he?

We were just wondering, you know, all things being equal

the asset does have a price

and it would be crazy to add an emotional premium here

So should we be looking for a back door.on this?

What's Dad's ceiling?

Well, what's your ceiling?

You go first, Tommy. Build that trust, br uh.

His ceiling is..

Your dad is just.

I can't say...

Shiv, could we just talk?

-Our ceiling is 12. -Fuck off!

-Yeah. -Okay, sure.

Ours, too. Okay

I think Dad is gonna go to nine. 9,5

So we need to be at 9,5. Right, Tell is?

You know what, I wonder..

I wonder if we don't nickel and dime it and we just go to ten.

So, we think Dad's at eight-five, nine.

So, we go nine-five to top them out.

But ten? Just to show that were really serious?

That's just an extra half bil?

It's definitive. It ends the conversation.

Well, that's a pretty penny for a conversation ender

Can't I just, like, jizz in her Break Bumper?

It rounds it out

Oh, it rounds it out, yeah

It does that, it makes it extremely divisible.

I mean, you do know what half a billion dollars is, right?

500 million dollars?

-Yeah. -Tell is...

A million is a thousand thousand. You do know that.

500 times a thousand thousand of actual money

that we could be spending on snowmobiles and sushi.

It's getting top py.

but it would be great to be the preferred bidder here.

But is it actually worth it?

It's worth what the top bidder will pay, I guess.

I really wish I went to Harvard Business School like you, T.

It is intimidating talking to an intellectual giant

like yourself.

Ten? -Ten.

I mean...

Okay. Yeah, ten. Fuck you. Ten.

So. Nan, look.

We love the company and the heritage.

and we'd like to make an offer that we think values the company

and ends the conversation and closes this out.

On an indicative handshake

we'd like to take Pierce to the next stage

of its evolution with a bid of ten billion dollars

That gives us something to think about.

So they're not accepting another bidder

Excuse me?

They said they've received a conversation-ending offer

Tell the m I'll go up. -She says they're content

That's bullshit.

I get the impression it's upwards of 9,5

Fucking geniuses. Ten?

I get a ten feeling.

Kind of feels like we should fucking open some champagne.

I am going back to LA to retire to my bedroom

and pull myself off quite aggressively hard

Thankyou very much.

Shotgun. -Hang on!

Will you speakerphone me, Shiv? -Yeah. It's Tom

Hi! Okay.

So, I have your dad and he has a message

Congratulations on saying the biggest number, you fucking morons

I think we got him.

Yeah.

It's me.

Mondale...

It's okay.

Hey.

Sorry, did I wake you?

No. I thought you were hotel ing.

I needed wardrobe access, actually

I thought you took your favorites.

I don't wanna be restricted to my favorites, Tom

Okay. Do you wanna talk?

I hear you and Greg call yourselves the Disgusting Brothers now.

Right.

Pretty cool.

Do you have a logo, and do you do " The Rules "?

Is Greg your wingman?

We sometimes grab a drink, Shiv.

It's pretty cool. I hear you date models now.

Well, we agreed that we could have a look around

while we had a think, right?

You look good. Ripped

Well, I don't think so. But thank you

Did you get buff for the models, Tom?

Do you bring them back here and do the positions?

Do you do all the positions with your models now, Tom?

Do you take turns with Greg?

Do they sit on your face to shut you up?

Do you really want to get into a full accounting

of all the pain in our marriage?

Cause if you do, I can do that

How's Mondale?

Mondale's fine. Don't worry about Mondale

I guess he doesn't recognize your scent any longer.

Well, things have become complicated

I wonder if there's even a way through this

Right.

You know, I wonder if we might've run out of road

We were going to have a big talk

I wonder if you might want to make it official, you know?

Do you wanna talk?

There's some things I wouldn't mind saying and explaining

I don't wanna rake up a whole lot of bullshit for no profit, Tom.

But I feel... -Just stop!

I don't think it's good for me to hear all that.

I think it might be time for you and I to move on

That makes me sad.

Sure.

And you don't want to talk about what happened?

Tom, I think we could talk things to death

But actually, we both just made some mistakes.

I think a whole lot of crying

and bullshit is not gonna help that

If you're good,

we can just walk away with our heads held high

and say good luck, yeah?

Well, okay

I could see if I can make love to you.

Would you like to?

I don't think so, Tom

Should I go? Or are you gonna go?

I'm tired, so..

But you can stay there, if you like

Okay.

So this is it?

Yeah, I guess

Gave it a go...

Yeah, we gave it a go.

Two men sustained life-threatening injuries

as result of a brawl gone too far

However, no shots were fired at this family friendly 3-day event

Instead, Brian Allen and Pete Meyers

two firearms experts in their own right.

Hello? Logan?

Cyd, I just watched the top of the hour.

It's bullshit.

People watch ATNight,

I watch AT Night.

Okay.

Who is this fucking lunk anyway?

He looks like a ball sack in a toupee.

Are you losing it, Cyd?

I'm all over it, Loge

Are you fucking losing it?

I'm on it. Don't worry

" This has sullied a family-oriented

and entirely peaceful occasion."

The Fayetteville Gun Show continues.

We'll be back right after this
