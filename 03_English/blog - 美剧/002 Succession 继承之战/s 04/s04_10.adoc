In terms of Miand A action

we're hearing that GoJo and Waystar

Could seal their long-gestated deal as soon as tomorrow.

Word is that regulatory concerns have receded

So Lukas Matsson may soon take control

of the deceased Logan Roy's empire

to add to his streaming, betting, sports, and socials, everything app

All right.

Okay, okay

Carpe the diem, people

Telly, let's run this board presentation, shall we?

Yeah. Great. Thanks.

Good stuff.

So...  -What?

Just Stewy. That was his guy

And...  -Yep

Yeah, I don't think we got him

Cool, cool.

Really?

Where is he? Get me him direct.

It might be smokescreen. I think..

Yeah, that'll be... that'll be smokescreen

I can pull in Stew.

Ken, I...  -Man.

I don't think we have the shareholders

and I don't think we have the board numbers to stop this

I'll get the votes.

If we had more time...

but by tomorrow, Ken, we...  -I'll get the votes.

You want to just... outline the path here.

Okay. I got fuckin' me, I got Ewan, I got Paul, I got Dewi

Locked. So, yeah?

Okay, great. And?

And I still think I can get Stewy

I think maybe Sonya. Maybe Frank

There are multiple... multiple routes

Right now, you have four and one of them..

And is Roman even gonna show?

Is he gonna vote?   -Don't worry about Roman.

But just where does he stand?   -I don't know.

I don't know, I don't know. I don't fuckin' know.

Okay?

I don't know.

Okay? Does that make you feel better?

I don't know where he is, I don't know where he stands

But I got him. Okay?

I fucking got this, Telly bear

Okay.

I think they lost Stewy. He's wonked.

So, that means we got Kendall in the trunk

all trussed up and ready to fuckin' bake.

Yeah?   -It's good.

Okay. 'Cause, you know, we got me, obviously, here.

Me, Simon, Frank, Sandi,and Sandy, locked

And then Stewy, I..

Look, he talks a lot of shit,

but I think he's... he's gonna stay

He's not gonna split

'Cause money, honey. Right?

So, then we got Diane Liu, Sonya.

And then we... we have it.

Then, if we peel off Dewi, Paul, and Ewan

then there's only, like, Ken and Rome in the against.

That's fuckin'... And Rome might not even show up

from whatever jerk dungeon he's being pity-spanked in.

You happy?

Very happy. Very... yeah

Yeah. Good.

Success. Yeah.

Oh, and I'm checking in on Frank

if you still wanna do the old-school signing

Perfect.  -You know, me as new CEO? Yes?

And your list? What's... what's on..

You wanna talk Tom?

Or, I don't know, you've been thinking about ATN

and just... just say out loud, it's no big deal for me

Well, we've... we've had some initial, like, vibe meets.

Yeah, I mean, he's shitting himself.

Yeah, well, the... the delta between a guy and a 10x guy

is obviously life and death

and ATN is central, so...  -Sure.

Tom, Tom. Yeah.

I don't know. What... what do you think?

Okay, well, he's very competent

but if he irks you or it's complicated

it is okay, yeah?

He is very plausible corporate matter

but he's also just a highly interchangeable modular part

And I would say that to his face.  -Okay

Okay, but if we wanted continuity

because there's been a lot of changes

you know, ATN is going gangbusters and he is well-liked

So, if he were to stay on, that would also be okay with me.

Okay. Good to know.  -Yeah.

This is separate, feelings aside

Tom will honestly suck the biggest dick in the room

That's just my assessment.

Love is in the air.  -Yeah

Sorry. Excuse me.

Yeah. Just one sec.

Hello, darling. Is this... How are things going?

Yep, fine. Good. Good, thanks.  -Great.

I just wanted to know if there was any chance of you coming

Yeah, I mean, look, I would love to.

but I think, you know, fuckin' schedules

and... and board.

Yeah, I know, but..

well, there's somebody here I think you might want to see.

I promised I wouldn't say, but..

it's one of your brothers.

And it's not Kendall

Okay. Well, let me crack the code.

I just thought you'd like to know.

Yeah, well..

let me have a think, but let's..

Yeah, let's try and... try and make this work

Shall we?   -Great.

That okay? That profile bullshit?

The cartoon?   -Yeah.

I think it's funny.  -Yeah.

Like, "Oh, look at me, look at me.'

You know? It's good.  -Yeah. 'Cause I..

Cause I can get the journalist, you know

maybe take the online...

No, no. I don't give a fuck

People always try to fuckin'... get at me, you know?

Okay.  -They can't.

Look, that was... that was an associate of mine

indicating they got a fix on Roman

So, why don't I just fuckin' go and nail Roman as well?

It would be so nice just to get unanimity across the board, you know?

All of us smiling in public, just.

just nice clean start for the start of our reign

All right.  -Yeah, 'cause..

You know, corporate narrative, if we're on separate sides

it looks like Lady Macbeth Part Two

and that's not...

It would be... it would, just in an...

It would be nice, in an abundance of caution

just to... close nice.

Yeah, yeah.  -Great.

All right, call me whenever, wherever.

Yep.  -I'm available.

Okay? Yeah? Let's fuckin' do this.

Go get 'em.  -Yeah?

Hey, Shiv. What are you hearing?

Rome's at my mom's

So, I'm on my way to bag him.

I'm looking for unanimity

Okay. He's at your mom's?

And have you spoken to Lukas?

Am... am I for the chop?

Yeah, I mean, I'm trying.

Okay. I'm just... I've got a bad feeling.

We've booked me in for the third "hang.

It's excruciating. I'm just..

I'm scared he's gonna wanna play online games

and I'll be running into a wall for hours, you know?

Tom. Hey, Tom. Can we have a real conversation?

Okay, so, on the Matsson stuff...I'll do what I can. I'm trying.

But with us, I just... I wanted to get a few things straight

Yeah. I, just... I... Yeah. I just want it to be really nice

And we should, we should Czechoslovakia it

You know, we should make it all lovely, velvet, parting of the ways

So, for you, there's not anything left?

Well, how do you mean?

Well, I wondered if..

you know, I guess I thought it might be worth raising

Are there any positives

about the nightmare we've shared?

As in...

I guess if... if there was anything there.

if there was, then it would be so convenient.

Yeah, well, it would be incredibly convenient

because you would be married to your husband

Yeah. Exactly

And then, I mean, think of the scheduling. It's mess-free.

Yeah. You've fallen in love, finally

You've fallen in love with our scheduling opportunities.

And I would also, you know, I would love to not to have..

You don't like to fail a test, do you, Siobhan?

Well...

Look...I know that we've said the worst things.

But I...

I think I've always just been scared in relationships of.

you know, like... the underneaths.

You know, what's the worst thing a person thinks?

But we know.

But once you've said and done the worst things

you're kind of free

Yeah, I guess my question is..

are you interested in a real relationship?

Honest to God, I don't know.

Shiv, I just... I..

I just don't know.

Okay. Sure. All right. Bye.

Stewy. Stewy, bro.

Don't hide from me.

I can see you from up here.

Come with me, Stew. We can win this. Okay?

Ken?   -Yeah?

Roman.

From Greg and Rat fucker Sam.  -Okay.

Okay. Now we're talking.  -Yeah.

Hello, darling.

Hey, Mom. So, I hear Romey might be there.

Listen, I'm sorry I couldn't make your get-together

but I need to speak to Roman very urgently

No recriminations, but it's life or death.

Is he there?

I... I can't say.

Oh, you can't say?

Well, he needs to come back.

Is he planning to come back? For tomorrow?

That's for you to decide, all of you.

I... he's very fragile

And... and is Shiv there? Is she coming?

I don't want to get into a lot of business, all right?

I want...I'd love for the whole family to be here

but if it's going to be thumbscrews

I'd rather it didn't happen in my house.

Okay. I'm coming, I'm coming. I'll be there, Mom.

We have him, we have him.  -All right, great.

New Jess, New Jess, I'm flying out.

I'll be back tonight, early tomorrow latest

Small team. Read your stuff

I'll put this together on the move.

Okay?   -Yeah, yep.

Let's get him. Let's bag him and tag him.

Hey. How you doing?   -Hey. Welcome

Shit. What the fuck happened to you?

Hello, hello. How lovely

Oh, wonderful. I see you've brought your underling with you.

Yeah, well, I've got a lot going on.

What the fuck happened, man?

Yeah, I just had a discussion with some of your pals

about the merits of liberal democracy

Okay, well, it's good that you're here, I guess

You can rest and recuperate

Looks a lot better than he did

I couldn't look at it when he first arrived

Oh, that's true. Peter did my eyedrops

Yeah, bless him.

There's something about eyes, they just kind of... revolt me.

Eyes? Like human eyes that we all have?

I don't like to think of all these blobs of jelly

rolling around in your heads

Face eggs.

Anyway, come on in.

Place hasn't changed

Still full of leaks.

Yeah.  -Seem to have landed myself with the only hellhole in paradise

Pick up... Stewy.

Stewy.

Stewy, there you are.

Are you with me? Talk to me.

Good man, good man.

I knew you wouldn't do me dirty like that

I'm just making a pit stop. I found Roman.

I mean, I always had Roman

but this is just, like, nailed-nailed.

Okay.

With Lawrence Yee? Vaulter Lawrence?

Okay.

What shape does that make?

Romey!

Where are you?

Hello, hello.

The hunt for Red fuckin' October is over.

Hey, Portia.

Well, well, well. Look at this fuckin' family scene.

Just easy.  -Are you okay, man?

Easy.  -Fuck happened to your face?

What happened to your face?   -He's fragile, yeah? Just easy

He's fragile?   -Hey, fuck you, "fragile."

I'm not fragile. What?

'Just back up, yeah? Just take it easy.

Back up?   -Yeah

What? I'm just arriving for a cup of fucking tea.

Okay, well, you're being very aggressive.  -You've missed teatime.

Rome?   -Yeah? Just calm down.

Hello.  -I'm calm. Can we talk? Okay?

Oh, God. I don't... Okay.  -We gotta talk

They're fucked.  -Don't talk to me that way, okay?

Yeah, they're fucked, you're fucked, we're fucked, everyone's fucked

Don't bullshit me, man. I don't like that.  -What is this?

What is what?

Did you get your little fucking screwdriver in on him?

You pry him open?   -No.

No.  -Rome, that's bullshit.

We're in this. We're in this, man.  - Yeah? Yeah. We will.

What's going on?   -She's doing a number on you, man.

Hey. Hey, Mom. Hey.  -Hello, darling

Yes, hi.  -Are we all right?

Yeah. I just need to talk to Roman.

Well, I'm looking after Roman.

You're not looking after me, Mom.

Okay? I'm just... I'm here.  -Well, let's be civil, please.

That's what I'm doing. It's fine.  -Rome.

What?   -You promised me.

Okay? You promised me you wouldn't do this.

You promised me your wouldn't change your mind on this

Well, maybe I did, and I'm sorry and whoops, I don't give a fuck.

This is fuckin' Def Con One. Okay?

The world is pivoting on you.

The world is turning on a fucking clown here.

Okay, you're a fucking clown, man.  -Look at you

Look at you, man. You're a clown. Living in a fucking dream world.

You don't have it..

So, why are you trying to, like, fucking get into me, okay?

Roman needs some peace and quiet.  -I have Ewan, I have Paul..

I have Dewi, and I have Stewy.  -I was in a very violent fight

which I won, by the way, but I am fine

I just... Just back the fuck up, okay?

Everyone just stop talking.  -Okay, I'll leave you alone.

I'll go if you'll just tell me how you're voting.

You're still talking. You're talking to me.

I don't want you to talk.  -Come on, man up, man.

I need you to man up here, Roman.  -Great. Thankyou. I'm going.

Don't fucking hide and...  -Please don't follow me. Don't talk.

Are you staying to dinner

or are you just in and out with all the shouting?

'Cause I'd love it if it wasn't a horror show.

I can't, there... I have... There's a huge board meeting.

"Huge board meeting." Gosh, well, what an event.

That's never happened before in my life.

I've never had my plans ruined by a huge board meeting before.

Well, I would love to. I'm in for dinner.

Great.  -He might be busy.

You gotta call some people, yeah?

You're... He's losing, so he's very busy

Yeah, that would be nice, Mom. That would be nice.

I... I got nowhere to be.  -Great.

What do you think, man?   -What do I think?

The colors go well

Trippy, dude.

Lukas. A second, please.

More hang, more fucking hanging than a dictator's birthday

Hey. "The colors go well"? Is that a sentence?

Yeah, yeah. The colors go well.  -Does that make sense?

The colors go well together.  -Colors go well

Yeah, it's okay.  -The colors go well

The colors just go well.  -Greg, you're here for the hang

So, you know, to jump in on the little

you know, those awkward social beats

you gotta be, like... like fucking social putty

Okay? You're letting me swing

Okay? He's gonna fucking fire me, I know.

I need ears and eyes out

You know, like, on the assistant loop

Ebba... like, is he planning to kill me?

If he wins, if he gets in,

you are fucked.

You're fucked.

All right, well, he likes me, so..

You? You? 200k?

The highest-paid assistant in human history?

It's new management, bro

You're gonna get busted down to 20, 30, 40k.

You know? Seriously.  -Stop it

And if I get fired, I think you are fucked

It's the family death march

Early bird catches the Rome?

Well, you know... yeah

Just... a couple of things you might be interested in

I got Stewy back.  -Oh, yeah?

Sure. Well, you know..

even if he's telling the truth.

and you manage to get Roman

seven still plays six, so I'm...

I'm not sweating it

Oh, yeah, also.

according to my sources

Matsson is talking to Lawrence Yee.

Vaulter Lawrence?   -Yeah?

So... you knew that?   -Yeah.

Hey, look at this. Fuckin' scorpion party

Hi.  -All right, who wants a piece of me?

Pay a buck, take a pop at the human fucking vote

Why don't I just cut my arms off?

I can give one to each of you to take home with

and then maybe you'll fuck off

Do you want some rum punch?

Hey, I was... So, I was thinking.

and this is just a spitball

but when this goes through, for you guys..

Remember how hot you were for The Hundred?

You know, could I

relinquish my part of the IP and...  -No, but that is very thoughtful

Wow, so, you'll like, get us a job at the mall?

Like, teach us the value of real money?

Rome, come on.

I'm, like... I'm trying to be realistic about

finding nice shapes here for when I'm in there.

That's nice.

Well, it is nice.

Yeah, actually, I would love for both of you

to support me taking over the firm.

What?

Oh, because I'm moving forward, my kid loses access to its uncles?

Yeah?   -Well, that's

No, come on, I mean, what's it gonna do

without all the... the sexist and homophobic jokes?

Don't fuckin' try and play us, Shiv

Like, stop fucking gloating

You've got your hands on my throat, yeah?

So, don't be all fuckin' Joan of Waystar.

All right, well, I don't know what to say

'cause you... you know, you fuckin' grabbed the crown, the two of you.

Dad died and you fucking.

you grabbed the crown and pushed me out.

So, I don't know why I'm the cunt here.

Cunt is as cunt does.

Amazing.

Wow, Cicero on the... on the wheels of steel.

Fuck off. Okay? I won.

And I'm sorry for winning. But I did.

Sorry. I'm sorry.

And you know what? I'm actually tired of saying fucking sorry

I played it better

so why don't you take it like a man and just eat it?

My, what a lovely evening on the terrace.

How is your sea bass?

Those... those cod cheeks were a worthy opponent, you know?

No, it was... it was fine.

Sometimes, I feel like every fish in this city

is the same piece of xeroxed branzino, you know?

Totally. Totally, yeah, I think we may have been badly advised.

I think Greg fucked it. Yep

Merci beaucoup

How would you feel about soft-pitching me? On Tom.

You know, the main slide

On me as in my value, to keep me?

Sure. Yeah.

Yeah, I can sing for my supper.

Well, no. So, yeah.

As a manager, I think, you know, I'm... I'm simple, you know?

I squeeze the costs and juice the revenue.

Follow the boss. You know?

I digest strategy and implement.

Like for, you know, Cruises, for example

was shit-gobbling and firefighting

Yes. And ATN is money.

You know, I'm cutting heads and harvesting eyeballs

It's pretty... Yeah, pretty simple

Really, I give the customer what he wants.

I don't think it's my place to offer dietary advice.

You know, if they want red meat and boiling tar,

then buonappetito, all right?

And on a hang level? Who would you say you are?

Who am I?

That's a good one.

I'm a grinder.

I grind 'cause I worry

I worry all night about everything

All the threats to me..

and to my division and my physical body and I...

I have an excess of vigilance, I think

And I have a very, very high tolerance for pain

and physical discomfort.

Can I be frank with you? Can... can you be discreet?

Fuck, yeah.

The thing is with Shiv...

and with the votes coming up and all

can we keep this, like, close to our chests

until I know my numbers?   -Oh, sure.

I think it's all fine. It's just, I.

I have this thing with her, which is, like..

like, is it a bit too much?

You know?   -Okay.

The cartoon?   -No, fuck the cartoon..

That was funny. I enjoyed that. No.

She was kinda pushy on the India tactics

and, at first, I thought, family, continuity

would be an upside, you know? But.

She is... she's smart, but...

but I got plenty of ideas, okay?

I don't know if I need more ideas

I was in need of a little bit of the political connection, you know?

But it turns out it's fuckin' easy. It really is, you know?

And with Ebba and blah blah blah, it's..

I know everything, okay?   -You do

I think you... I mean, you do, man.

I do.  -Yeah

Yeah.

Plus, with Shiv, there's also.

You know.

She...

She's somewhat..

We're a bit clickety-clickety

You know what I'm saying?

Right. Like...  -A little bit..

I wanna fuck her... a little bit

And I think under, like, sorry to get weird

but, like, the right circumstances.

She... I think she'd fuck me, too.

Is this making you uncomfortable? I'm sorry if it's weird

No. No, we're men.  -Yeah.

I can't deal with the mess of that, you know?

So, then I was thinking, well, if I can have fuckin' anyone in the world

why don't I get the guy who put the baby inside her

instead of the baby lady?

It's just...  -Right.

Right.

Well, I could do it.

I could definitely, easily, definitely do it.

I need an American 'cause I don't wanna scare the horses

ATN being the... the profit center

Mencken likes you,

if that happens.

You know? You..

you're fuckin' talented. So..

But also, honestly...

I'm not looking for a partner

You know? I'm looking for a frontman.

'Cause... we're gonna cut shit close to the bone.

We're gonna get right fuckin' in there.

It's gonna get nasty,

so I need a pain sponge.

when I'm under the hood doing what I love, you know?

Sure.  -That's kinda what I'm after.

So, would that be a problem?

Nah. No, man. No. I could do it

Logan Mark II.

Only this time, he's fuckin' sexy

Yeah. Do you wanna do some shots?

Can we? Yeah.  -Yes. Yeah

Yeah.  -Yeah.

Let's get a little loose, baby.  -Okay

Oskar.

Tom.

Motherfucker

What?   -Motherfucker.

What, are you... Are... Is it?

Are you keeping your job?

Am I?

We're going to be okay, Greg

We'll be okay.  -Which is it?

You're gonna get castrated on pay. Like decimated

But I think I can keep you. Okay?

Keep an eye on. Piss man out.

Okay.

Shit.

Fuck

Gregory! Hey! -Have a drink!

Do you want a shot? We're doing shots

If we're doing shots, I'll do shots.

Yeah, you can handle some vodka, right?

Oh, yeah.  -From the motherland

It's going to be hearty fare, but modest rations.

Surprise, surprise.

Well, I knew you wouldn't be hungry in this heat.

Anyway, we can fill up on brekkie tomorrow.

That horrible place where...

I think someone from Pink Floyd did a poo in the swimming pool

Yeah, we'll need to be getting back, Mom.

Really?   -To stop Shiv selling our birthright

Well, actually, to continue on with Dad's plans and wishes.

Oh, please, can we just not?

You know, I'm really happy to have you all here, and I..

I wanted to say, for what it's worth

I don't want to stick my snout in too far..

maybe, I'm wondering whether this offer from that awful man

isn't a perfect opportunity

to, you know, say farewell, open a new chapter

That's always been my view.

Are we gonna get an apology? For Italy?

Well, yeah, I mean, in some ways, in a way, there... Yeah

If she thinks we should sell, there's continuity.

It's my view and I'm sorry if you've been determined

to make something squalid out of it

Is this a set-up?

Is that what this is, Shiv?

You... you trying to tie Mommy's apron strings around Romey's nuts?

What?   -I'm going to get Peter.

I'm going to get Peter and his friend because..

Peter! -Coming

His friend Jonathan and he have got a scheme

they want to talk to you about

and Jonathan...  -A scheme.

Jonathan's an absolute whiz.

He's just been going through some shitty stuff recently

Hello, hello.

This is Jonathan.

Is this a fucking pitch? Is that what this is?

It might seem inappropriate, but your mother...  -No, not at all.

No, it might seem inappropriate, but it's not

because your mother's been kind enough

to allow me to

get you before the vultures

because, frankly, the margins on this thing are just so creamy

that I..

I honestly would feel like a terrible shit if I didn't..

if I didn't give you the chance to come to the party

That's all.  -Pardon me. I'll be back

This is really interesting, Ken.  -I can't believe how rude you are

Hey, man.  -Hey, Ken. Hey

So, okay, so I have something huge

Dude, I'm in the center of the fucking universe

with, like, knowledge to... fuckin', like, take down solar systems, man.

Sure, sure, man. That... that's great

Okay, but... if I give you something incredible

would you give me something amazing?

Yeah, sure. Like what?

Well, I'm serious, dude. It is... it is amazing

Sure, that's why I'm gonna give you something incredible

I would need.

Basically, I get... Can... can you guys win?

You and Rome? If..

And could I quad it up? Like, full quad?

Take your shot, buddy. Just take your shot. Come on

Okay. Buckle up.

Now, we're gonna be skating very close to the wind..

Yeah.  -...but I'm absolutely confident

that no one can, well, in layman's terms, get us on this

Right.

Hey, it's Kendall. Gonna ask you a question

If there's any veracity to it, don't say anything

You understand?

Matsson is talking to other people

The point is, our facilities won't offer

all that you dreamt of in a fantasy care home

but it will afford what I call a really solid basic level of care

Not necessarily that one would like for oneself.

You know, they're not going to offer..

Apologies. Shiv

What?   -I need to speak to you. In private.

Can I be saved as well?   -No, sorry, guys. Please forgive me.

Sorry, this is very captivating.  -Rome, Rome, Shiv, please, please.

You're gonna wanna hear this. It's serious.

Don't be too late. For heaven's sakes

Mom, I need to..

Jonathan, I'm so glad you came.

Well, the fish will just be gummy by the time you get back, it's just.

I love gummy fish.  -Gummy fish

Okay, this is... this is...  -What?

You're... you're gonna wanna call, you'll wanna confirm

but I've just had it confirmed

Lukas is interviewing for an alternative US CEO

He's fucking you.

Bullshit.

How do you...  -It... it's confirmed

A source, a number of contacts

I'm sorry, Shiv.  -You...

Yeah, you're sorry? Bullshit, bullshit.

Call whoever. Like, it checks out

Lawrence, a bunch of vibe hangs.

Have you noticed a little cooling a little bit?

I wouldn't call Matsson so we can figure out.

Already calling, already calling

This fuckin' desperate shit, yeah?

See this?

Is he not answering? That's interesting

Does he... does he normally?   -No. Rarely, actually

This is so fucking pathetic.  -What's pathetic?

You are.  -Okay. Fine. Yeah

I guess it would be if it wasn't true

Like, do... Call Karolina, call Karolina

They have erased you from the new deal announcement draft

It's shitty, Shiv. It... it's shitty

Is this fuckin' actual? Is this a move? Is this real?   -Yeah. No, it's real

Greg, hundred percent.  -Fuck.

So then, who instead?

A few faces. Lawrence, I think Klein.

I don't know who else. I'll know soon.

Man.

Okay, I mean.

With her, things are... things are back?

As long as she can recalibrate. Yeah

Motherfucker!

I think it's game on.

Fucking call me back.

I think it's just hard for her.

Yeah, that's very apparent.

That's... that's a real thing

Shit.  -Yeah.

All right, well..

So, we just..

I think we just lay it out for her

Yeah.

Hey.  -Okay, so...

What do we do?

Well, did you talk to him? Lukas?

No. I don't wanna talk to Lukas.  -Okay

No, I don't wanna... That I don't

Don't fucking look at me.

What? Hey. I'm sorry

No, you're not. Shut the fuck up.

Okay. What can I say?

Except maybe nothing. We might get someone

We might get Laird or Tellis.

No, not fucking Laird

and not Tellis

I fucking... I hate Tellis, I detest Tellis, he's the worst.

He is the worst

Call Tellis, call Tellis.

We obviously need a read. Call Tellis

But he's not getting even a tiny piece of this. Yeah?

You okay? To do this?

This is ugly, and this is bad. It doesn't feel great

I know. But we're a powerful bloc

Okay? It was sloppy. It was careless.

We're ready to fuckin' kill him.

Yeah, I mean, I think you're chasing rainbows

To be honest, I think he has this all sewn up, but sure.

You there?   -Telly

Hey.  -Telly, thanks, man. You got my message?

I just saw it.

So, look, this is non-prejudicial. This is friend-level briefing

clean of upside, downside, or legal action.

Side effects may include a fat fucking consultation fee.

So... so, yeah. This makes sense about US CEO?

Him changing lanes?   -Yeah.

I mean, from his point of view, he doesn't need the name.

He needs chops

And Shiv doesn't have...  -Shiv's here

Fuck you, Tellis.

Sorry, Shiv. No. I.

I just mean in terms of the names which are being discussed

they make... I just..

Cut to the chase, blondie

Okay, if it's you three as a voting bloc

and on top you have, say..

I have... I have Ewan

I have Paul. I have Dewi, I think

And then, Stewy. Pretty sure

I mean, as a voting bloc, you can probably threaten to kill it.

So, yeah, you have the whip hand

What about leadership? Yeah?

Yeah, you need to present a coherent plan to the board

including your leadership candidate.

And... and a combination or, like a trio, a troika

would that work or..

Well.

Just fucking say it, man. Just say.

I think it hasn't been great for credibility

The Incredible Fuck Brother Bandwagon

I don't know who the hell calls us The Incredible Fuck Brother Bandwagon

Everyone.  -Really?

You need to look like a united front with a coherent plan

that's not a cop-out at the fudge factory.

One strong name for CEO

either combined with a chair or a chair with business chops

Is what I would say. Off the record

Thanks, Telly. Thank you

Okay, we might be in touch with some moves here, man

Sounds good, Ken

I think there's a few ways through this

Call Laird. Call anyone. Honestly, anyone

Anyone would say we have to go into battle

with our own version of the future, with a king

Oh, and pray tell, do you have one in mind?

Matsson's a fuckin' prick. Right?

He practically killed Dad, dragging him over.

He's capricious, he's cold, he doesn't understand the business.

He's a prick.

I would like to kill him.

And if we're gonna kill him, we need to get real

And we would need.

I think it would be me, right?

Well..

Dad said that it would be me.

When?

Well, we were getting close again before

and you know this, mostly

And I was texting, and he was warm

and he said when I was with him late one night that it should be..

Persuasive

What else did he say when no one was around?

That he was the Zodiac Killer? That he did Tupac?

Whatever. It's fuckin'... I said it, it's true, and

Yeah. Fuck it. Do whatever you want with that.

It's just the fuckin' truth.

Well, he offered it to me, too, Rome.

Oh, yeah?

He...

he fuckin' promised it to me

Promised. When I was seven.

He sat me down at the Candy Kitchen in Bridgehampton

and he fuckin' promised it to me.

Seven years old

Like, can you imagine?

Yeah.

Pics or it didn't happen.

That was... messed up.

Like, he shouldn't have done that.

No. He shouldn't have said that.

I'm simply saying he said a lot of things..

and he said them to me first

Yeah, and he said it to me last.

Do you even want it?

Because... at the funeral, yeah?

Like, you're... you're not that guy.

You're not...  -What?

You couldn't... do the rounds

I mean, you kinda...  -Well, what?

.shrank into yourself, I mean, that.

What? 'Cause I, like, fuckin'... I cried a little at my father's funeral?

That means I'm totally fucked forever?

That doesn't seem right

It absolutely does not make you a bad person.

Like, maybe it makes you a good person

that you weren't snaking at the funeral.

Like, maybe... maybe you're well-adjusted

and I'm a business psycho

I don't know, man. It... like..

It's... it's a fuckin' horrible job that clearly kills you

So I'm just.

Honestly, I'm just trying to guide us through the years

to some truth here, man.

Great. Yeah. Cheesy.

I'm serious

Yeah. A serious fuckin' cheeseball is what you are.

He just can't say it.

He doesn't want it, but he can't say it

And me?

I love you, Shiv. I fucking love you

But we simply cannot walk in there

and say we're blocking his offe

and we have this compelling vision

and say that leading it is you

when yesterday, you were singing his song

We simply can't.

And we can't say it's Roman

because he lacks heft and he looks pathetic

and he might flop, so.

Obviously, I want it to be me.

But I genuinely think anyone would say

anyone objectively would say

LA, my profile, experience

position, desire, public pronouncements.

it's me.

If we wanna hold on to this company, for us

for my kids, for yours.

it's me.

Hey, Rome.  -Yeah.

Guess who Kendall thinks it should be.

It's gonna blow your fuckin' mind

Okay..."-We can find a cool structure.

Right? Like fiefdoms, kingdoms

We pull off a reverse Viking, guys? Like, it's fuckin' huge.

Shiv, seriously, take ATN, take all of news

save the world.

Rome, social media

fuck it all up again, it'll be fun.

We aren't actually going in, right? 'Cause, you know.

There's no bad sharks in Bim, baby. They're North Atlantic

Well, they could commute

All the seas, in case you didn't know this

are connected

It's like a huge water subway for things that wanna eat me.

Come on, let's do it. Come on

Should we?

Yeah.  -Okay.

Can you give us a minute?

Maybe.

So?

We could fuck it. Get out

Sell to Matsson, let..

Lawrence or some other business-school dry cleaner

sit in the throne

Shut up shop and give away the keys

It can't be him, though

But it really can't be you

Well, okay, I hate him, but I fear you

He would be unbearable, and you would be a disaster.

He'd be...

It will be terrible. It will

But... I don't know. I can sort of, unfortunately, see it

Whereas you..

Matsson took me seriously

Or he played you like a big fiddle

Like a pregnant cello

Sorry.

Who do you think Dad actually wanted to give it to?

I don't think Dad gave a fuck about anything

more than putting one foot in front of the other.

Yeah, I don't think he wanted to give it to any of us

Yeah.  -I don't know.

We could give it to him.

Yeah. We probably should

Unless...  -Unless?

Unless we kill him.  -Okay. Kill him

Yeah.  -I like that.

That's intriguing. How'd we do it?

Well, just a bit of horseplay gone wrong

Just a biff to the head then a bonk on the noggin with a coconut

Wait 'til he goes limp. What goes around comes around?

Yeah, and if we kill him, we get to go to bed.

I'm tired.

He'd be so annoying if it went wrong

The murdering? Like..

"Did you just try to murder me?

Dude, that is so not actually what you meant to do

and it is not a good thing to do."

"You guys actually just murdered me. You guys are the worst

How dare you?"

Shall we?   -Yeah, yeah

Hey. So, we were thinking of murdering you

Well, don't tell him

But you know, it's too much prep

Too much murder admin

No stomach for the admin.

So...  -Okay

We anoint you

You get the bauble.

Congratulations

It's haunted and cursed and nothing will ever go right

but... yeah, enjoy your bauble

Yeah?   --Yeah

Thank you.

Look at his face.

Yeah.  -You can smile, bitch

Yeah, there we go.  -There you go

Show some goddamn teeth.  -Happy Ken

Happy Ken.  -Happy Ken

Yeah, that's what happy Kendall looks like.  -Weird

If we're going to anoint him, he needs to complete a task

Yeah. Like walk upstairs and say real quietly.

"Hey, Jonathan, I'd like a word with you.

In my ass."

And say it with a spoonful of cinnamon in your mouth

Oh, that's been done.

That's what they made Lee Iacocca do when he took over at Ford

Rome.  -What?

Meal fit for a king?

Yes.

We are gonna make you a meal fit for a king, so.

Yes, sir.  -What a mighty bounty. All right

Is there actually anything in there for a sandwich?

I'm starving.  -Yes.

Mommy with hair-sprouting potatoes

zero-percent milk, and wartime pickle

You do spoil us so.

Something gross.

Oh, you... you know, you're gonna be a great CEO

I really think that.

If this doesn't kill you, which it definitely will

So...  -Well, I'm actually starving.

And I think this is expired, so..

This is a hot sauce.

Milk? Oh, it's a great starter.  -Milk.

Meal fit for a king..

Chuck it in, don't know...  -Quiet..

I see you all came back.  -Sorry..

What's going on?   -Hi, we're...

Meal fit for a king.  -making a meal fit for a king

Yeah? But can you do it quietly?   -I'm the king.

'Cause, you know, Jonathan's trying to get to sleep upstairs

He's trying to recover after your rudeness.

Sorry.  -Hey, he came all the way

from Monaco, he has to watch his days here.

We're... we're celebrating

We're not celebrating. We're mourning

We're trying to kill him

We're voting as a bloc. Together. To keep the firm

Blimey O'Reilly

Oh, gosh.

Well, on your head be it

Well, I had some negative news

and so then we decided to have a friendly conversation

about who should... who it would be

Now we have to anoint him because that's what you do to a king.

Fine. That fucks Christmas up, doesn't it?

And don't touch that. That's Peter's cheese

God's sake.

I made that mistake myself.

It's his special cheese. He gets really boring about it

Mother, there... there really isn't much food..

I'll tell you what, Peter doesn't like the knobbies

So I freeze them.

He doesn't like the what?   -You know, the knobbies

The loaf ends.  -Okay

Enjoy.  -Oh, it's a bag of frozen knobbies

Oh, well, look, you know, be inventive.

Do you know, I'm actually quite glad that you're getting along so well

I mean, Peter will be disappointed

but, you know, it's nice to see you've got something to agree about

besides what a terrible mother I am

Oh, well, we'll never disagree on that, Mom.

Yeah.  -Oh, I'm sure

Nighty-night.  -We love you

Yeah, I love you, too.  -I love you Mama

Night-night

I'm gonna eat his cheese.  -"Peter doesn't like

the knobbies, darling

You're a knobbie, you're a knobbie.

Catch it.  -You're a knobbie.

Okay, now three in a row? How do we do that?

Don't eat Peter's cheese.

Jonathan. Jonathan's sleeping.

Sorry, Peter.  -Don't lick Peter's cheese.

Oh, God, don't lick Peter's cheese.  -Oh, my God. That is so gross.

I'm so sorry, Mommy

Don't go down on Peter's special cheese.

I brought that over in a hankie, Rome.

I'm so sorry, Mommy. I licked it all over.

I'm so sorry, Mommy. I licked the cheese.

I can't stop licking his cheese. I'm so sorry.

Let's keep it quiet.

A little Tabasco.

A lot of Tabasco.

Now, this is really... We're so close

Branston... Oh, yeah

Branston pickle. You love that.

We're so close. Never got there.

Yeah, we're good

I think this is good

No, this is a healthful tonic

This is really good

Meal fit for a king

Yeah, wait...

I'm not actually drinking that

Meal fit for the king!

No, no, don't do that

Drink up.

This is gonna be all right, right?

Like... we're all right?

Yeah?   -Just fucking drink it.

Oh,God.

Oh, my God.

Kings don't wear silly hats

Kings wear crowns.  -I can't drink anymore.

Well, then, don't. Wear your crown, sir.

Oh, no.  -No... no.

No... no.  -Your crown. Wear your crown

No...  -No...

Then let me crown...  -No.

Oh, my God. Mom! -King!

Bye, Mom.  -Okay. Bye, darling

Thanks for the... the props

We'll do some business.

Yeah, bye.  --Bye.

Bye.  -Good to see you.

Go away.

What a complete fucking waste of time.

I mean, yeah, I... I think Ewan is best just left to it

I don't know if there's time, Con.

All right. I have him here with me. We just landed

Good ol' Paul, yeah, he don't do that, right?

Yeah, I'll...I'll go wherever, whenever for Stewy.

Paul's good. Paul's rock. He doesn't trust tech.

Good old Paul.  -Connor wants to know

if we're gonna make the Great Reallocation?

Oh, I mean, do we care? Do we want to?

Are Frank and Karl gonna be there?

'Cause it could be...  -Don't know

I don't know.  -  Okay, could we just do..

We're gonna hide out at Dad's

He's kinda losing this shit, so.

Let's do it. To the Great Reallocation.

Let's go.  -Okay, off we go

We'll be there. Yeah.  --To the fuckin' Antiques Shitshow!

Dewi!

How are you?   -I'm good

To my dad's.  -Got it.

I know that many of you

have somewhere rather important to be this afternoon

But the system is pretty simple

So, as you move in a clockwise direction around the apartment

affix your stickers to objects you covet

One sticker each on a number of different articles

or many on one prized item.

Okay, so subsequent circulating mourners

will then apply their stickers.

After two stickering perambulating circuits

We call them SPCs.  -Okay.

...objects will be assigned to the highest sticker bidder.

Where sticker claims are tied

we move on to the tie-break stickering perambulation circuit.

TBSPCs

After which, all unstickered items will be pooled and distributed

in reverse alphabetical order

other than those stickered by the second tier

excuse me, bereaved.

Do I make myself clear?

Absolutely. It's a good system, Con.

All right, it's on. Go get 'em

Oh, that's nice.

Game on.  -Hey, Con. Where are the medals?

Yeah, there was a... first round.

There was... an initial round

And who was present at that?

That was myself.

Solely.  -Right.

Okay, and does all of this have to go?

I mean, you don't wanna...

Well, I'd like to get rid of pretty much everything

I have some pretty cool stuff coming in

like a cow print couch about, like, yea long

Great. Con? You don't wanna keep more for..

Well, we're planning on if... when Mencken comes through

we're actually experimenting with an idea..

I have a play reading in six to eight months.

and Con is going to Slovenia and I'll be working on that

so we're gonna try...

Yeah, you know, we're... we're really excited

how this long-distance thing

can add another dimension, you know, to..

Yeah, add a little spice, you know?

As we, you know, get deeper into the marriage.

Yeah, that's sexy

They call that the second-week itch, I believe.

Rome.  -Yeah.

We're excited.  -Yeah.

Head the latest about the Wisconsin court thing?

I'm sorry, what court thing?

It's a hiccup.

Just a little hiccup for Jeryd, I think

Okay.  -Yeah.

I mean, maybe Mencken might not make it

and so, maybe you might get to keep him all to yourself.

Great.

I think I'm gonna take this letter opener.

What the fuck is this?

Virtual dinner with Pop.

What?

When is this from?  ?   -I don't know how many weeks ago

Okay, here we go.

Gore, Dole, Bush.

Is he doing the... Wait, the loser's list?

Yeah.  -Mondale, Carter, a Ford

Not a Lincoln for me.

Hippie George, Humphrey, St. Barry.

Dick the Bad,

Wilke, Landon, Hoover, Al Smith of the Vatican

David Cox, Hughes, Taft

Bryan, Martin Van Buren

White, Old Tippecanoe, Clay

Hey, JQA.

How many elections...  -How many elections..

have you lost today?   -have you lost today?

Clinton the First..

But not the worst.  -but not the worst.

Pinckney twice. Jefferson, Adams, all very nice.

I can't believe he can still do that.

All right, who's next? Gerri?   --Yeah.

Do the limerick. Gerri, do the limerick

Yeah.  -Much dearer to me than my treasure

The heiress declared, is my leisure

For then I can screw The whole Harvard crew

They're slow But that lengthens the pleasure.

Yeah.  -Connor!

All right, okay...

I give you, ladies and gentlemen, I am a little teapot.

Oh, good one.  -In the manner of Mr. Logan Roy

Very good. Let's see it.  -Oh, my God

Showtime.  -I am a little teapot

Fuck off!

Short and stout. What did you fuckin' call me?

Here's my handle. Here's my fuckin' spout.

When I get steamed up, you can hear me shout.

Frank Vernon is a moron, Karl Muller is a Kraut!

That was incredible.

Pop did not like it.

Pop, how could you not?

It's creative.  -Hit him in his face

All right, Karl. Come on, sing it. Sing it

I want a copy of this. Sing it.

♪There's naught but care on every hand♪   -I'd like to have it.

Doing okay?

You're not gonna get canned?

I don't... I don't... I don't think so.

But...

Good luck.

No.

No, no.

No, that's all fucked.

Yeah?   -Well, yeah

I mean, Matsson was just stringing me along

or he switched lanes, but you know, it's..

Either way, it's not gonna be me.

Yeah.

Okay. I did... Are you sure?

mean, is that? How? What did... did.

Is that even true?   -Yeah. Greg.

Yeah

Man, oh, man, Man, oh man. What a thing.

That's... that's terrible.

So, like, who do... who do you think he would.

I mean, who would it be? Like.

I don't know. Like, a..

tech pal, big hitter. Lawrence, maybe.

Fuck.  -Yeah.

Well, fuck him.

Yeah. Well, 'maybe..

Maybe you should vote it through, you know, if it's all set.

I don't know.

What?   -Yeah? No, no, I just...

No, I was just thinking if it was..

No, no.

Yeah, Shiv, you should probably know...

it's me.

It's you?

Yeah, you might as well know.

I mean, you're gonna find...  -Bullshit.

mean, you're gonna find out. It's gonna be, I think

Yeah. And I...

You know, maybe... maybe I wonder if you..

if it is an idea that you should..

Oh, fuck you. Really?

Fuck you.

Yeah.  -What?

You...

Jesus, you're a fuckin'..

Like, he went for a... an empty-fucking suit?

"Oh, yeah, maybe, oh, actually, you should vote it through

Hey, yeah, maybe."

Come on. I know you

Like you wouldn't if it was the other way around?

You know what? Good luck. Yeah?

Good luck, motherfucker

Cause we have the numbers. Yeah?

Good fucking luck

It's Tom.

What?   -It's fucking Tom

Tom?

Yeah. Let's go.

Let's fucking go. Let's run our numbers

Let's go.  -Man. Fucked by the dry cleaner.

Hey, Greg. Can I have a word?

A word, yeah? Just... just right now?

Do you mind? Corporate matter. Tactical

Hi, Tom.  -Hey

See you.

Yeah, just in here.

In the bathroom?   -Sure.

Yeah.  -Come on.

Did you tell?

What?   -Did you fucking tell?

You bastard. I was this close.

And now they have a chance to fucking pull

their fucking opposition together, you fucking prick

No, I.. Look, I don't think..

You fucking little prick

You fucking little piece of... shit

Fuck you!

Problem. Big fucking problem.

All right, wake up, zombies!

Time to activate! Come on!

Phones! I wanna see some fuckin' phones!

And where's Frank? We get ahold of Frank.

Call Frank, call Frank... Make sure he's locked in

Okay. Where's Ebba?

Ebba!

Stewy?   -Yeah, a wobble.

He's a wobbly fucking bastard.  -Okay

Okay. Well, let's go get him. Let's fuck him up.

Silence in the courtyard

Silence in the street.

The biggest fool in England is just about to speak?

I'm gonna go to my office.  -All right.

Claire, do you have any messages?   -Hi

Hey.  -How you doing?

You'll be able to block, do you think?

Great. I think that's great

A chance to change the culture of backstabbing

a new era, and I was wondering..

Just between us and before, you know, things blow up

maybe part of that change is getting rid of Hugo

I just wanted to plant the seed, that's all

Mornin', mornin'

Congrats.

Yeah, thanks.

Well, looks like they've heard

their testicles might be on fire.  -Yeah

I haven't seen Frank run like that ever.

Okay, can we help prepare the ground?

Well, it's gonna be a fairly explosive mega-fuck, so yeah

The GoJo deal is gonna die

Frank maybe pulls the vote

or they push and get humiliated

So, yeah.

Big, big day on the old salami line, huh?

Yeah, it sure is. Yeah.

I'll get you the materials.  -Okay

Details on the financing

for background for... for the Journal piece.

Yeah, it's...  -Yeah. Whatever.

It's not a magic chair. Yeah, go ahead

Okay...  -Hey... How're we lookin'?

Hey, dude. We have it.

Okay? We have it.

But do we have you? We've got you, right?

Well, I do have certain questions about riding the vegetable train

But, like, I am a selfish person, so..

Do we invite the Stewpot in?

You know, get him inside?

Non-exec chair.

Fuckin' activist backtivist

Chair? Guys.

I like weird sex, I like bad drugs.

I'm a very complicated individual

Bullshit.

Bullshit, you like pancakes and waffles

and you kiss guys on Molly

You're not the heart of darkness

You're a... you're a grilled cheese with a sucked dick

Let us clean you up

Well, why don't we just think about it, huh?

And, Shiv...

you know, I do think if we give Sandi a little tug

she might be somewhat foldable

Okay. Great. Perfect, let's go

And you did a fucking good one, man.

Yeah?

Chairman Stewpot, I'm into that. Are you into that, Shiv?

Hey, what's she doing in?   -Shall we?

Who?   -Gerri. What's she doing here?

I don't know, I think.

we're paying her off big time, so it's not a lockout, right?

I don't... I don't wanna see her. Should she even be around?

Yeah, sure. Let's... let's fuck her out.

Yeah, I don't think I really wanna see anyone.

You okay?

Yeah. I think I'm gonna call in.

I think I'm gonna call in the vote. I think I'm gonna..

Yeah. I don't wanna.

Yeah, I think, man, it's

let people kinda know you're here

You know, show of force

Are you okay?

Yeah. It looks better than I thought

Looks so much better.

Yeah, it does. It does

Yeah. I feel like people are gonna be like...

Why isn't it me? You know? Like..

Sure, I mean, it could've been you, Rome.

It could easily have been you

It's just... it's just marginal presentation shit

You'll have something shit-hot. Socials. Right?

Right. No... But it's just, you know, it's the optics

It's dumb, but the stitches..

They're good stitches. They're good

This is 90% about the visuals

And I mean, just if, like, people think that I, like, pussied out

then I don't think that I should, you know..

Yeah.  -Yeah. I can't. No, I can't

'Cause, you know, like, I look okay.

Like, this looks fine, so, you know,

it's fuckin' stupid, but.

Like, why isn't it me?

Bro.

Okay. All right.

Oh, Jesus. Fuck.

Oh, you fucking bastard

I love you, man.  -Oh, shit. I fuckin' hate you

We'll be okay. All right?

Shit, it popped.  -We're gonna do good

Teamwork makes the dreamwork

It could've been you

Simon, how are you?

Good to see you. Thanks for being here

Ewan? New York's finest?

Absolutely. Appreciate it.

All right, let's call this meeting to order.

I note that all the directors are present

The agenda and the information packs have been circulated

and I would like to take them as read.

We have a revised offer to consider from the GoJo board

and a lot of work has been done to get us to a position

where we're ready to sign if the board agrees.

As you also, of course, are aware

we will be hearing from our co-CEOs about strategic alternatives.

We've aired the issues and heard from our advisors

on the GoJo proposal in the previous session.

So, now, I like to hand the floor to Kendall

Yeah. The... the GoJo offer.

Yeah, this deal... the deal is a bad deal.

The GoJo offer.

We were proud to land it, me and Rome.

We know it inside-out, but it's a bad deal

And if you want it to go through

you'll have to fire me and find someone else to take it through,

yeah?

I think you have your packs here

with the structural arguments and the financing options and.

Look, it's a nice thick pack.

We've knocked it out of the park,

and GoJo, Matsson, is flailing

We know that.

So, look, look.

We know each other.

I've spoken to you all.

I like and respect every one of you

But no one's gonna have their mind changed in here, right?

So, I suggest we move to the vote.

Kill this, excuse me, GoJo bullshit

and, you know, let's eat their lunch

Ken.

What? You want me to read it out for due process?

Come on. We have the votes

I would rather Simon.

Let's do it for my dad, guys. Yeah?

Would anyone object to moving directly to a vote?

No.

Very well.

So, yes. I think it's a good deal.

I can't in good conscience as chair vote any other way

Sonya?   -Yes.

Diane?   -Yes

Kendall?   -You know myvote.

No. No to GoJo

Yes.

And yes. We want out.

No. I'm against.

First, do no harm.

Nay.

Team Ken, baby.

I'm a no.

Roman?

Nope.  -That's fuckin' right

Shiv?

Let's just.

just give me time.

Shiv?

It's all good, it's all good

Excuse me, I'll be right back

Just a moment, please

With Paul's vote, it's now six to six.

Oh, my God.  -It's six to six.

I just...  -Hey.

You okay? We have... we have it, we have it

Yeah...  -Look... we have it

All right? We have it.

Are... are you scared?

I'm not scared.  -Are you sick?

No, I'm not scared.  -Okay. Are you good?

Yeah. I just... Can I have a moment, please?

Just fuck off. I just... need a moment.

I wanna think.  -Okay

Think about what?

Whether you want us to keep the company

or hand it over to Tom

and that piece of shit who killed our dad?

I might have changed my mind

What the fuck?

I'm good for this company. I'm... I'm good for us. We.

You know, we all vote, we keep control

We don't, then everything's over. Forever.

Here's the thing, I am like a cog built to fit only one machine.

Like, if you don't let me do this..

I mean, it's the one thing I know how to do

Well, it's not all about you.  -I know.

Yeah, you are not the most important one.

I... I don't think I am.

Yes, you do... You fucking do. You do

Look, Shiv, honestly, it's so fucking crazy not to just let me..

Now, I mean, it... it's stupid.

We... we all get something here.

I mean, you're voting against yourself.

You realize that?

Shiv. Shiv, listen. Please

I beg you, listen.

I can do this.

I don't think you'd be good at it.

What? I don't... I don't even believe you.

I don't believe you.  -I don't.

I don't think that you would be good at this.

For fuck's sake, Shiv!

I mean, for fuck's sake!

What the fuck is going on?

It... it's six to six, and we don't have Shiv's vote.

This doesn't make, like, logic. What's the logic?

No, I just don't think you'd be good at it.

I feel like... if I don't get to do this.

I... I feel like..

That's it.

That's it. Like, I might, I might.

like I might die.

Shiv, can we go in that room? Can you just vote?

Please.

You can't be CEO

You can't because you killed someone.

What are... What? Which?

What?   -Wait, what do you mean, "which"?

What? Like, you killed so many people you forgot which one?

That's... that's not an issue

That didn't happen.

Wait, it didn't? As in what?

It's... it's just a thing I said.

It's a thing I said. I made it up.

You made it up?   -Yeah, I..

I... it was a difficult time for us

and I think I... you know, whatever mussed up something from nothing

because I just... I wanted for us all to bond at a difficult moment

Wait, it was a move?

No, no, not... There was... there was a kid

So there was a kid

I had, like, a toke and a beer and not..

I... I didn't even get in the car, it's not.

Hold on. What?   -The fuck?

I felt bad and I... false-memoried it.

Like, I'm totally clean. I can do this.

Wait, did it happen or did it not happen?

It did not happen.

It did not happen. I wasn't even there.

It did not happen.

Dude.

Fucking vote for me.

Just please... vote for me.

Shiv. Vote for me.

No.

Yes.  -No.

Shiv, don't do this.  -No.

You can't do this, Shiv.  -No.

Yes.  -Absolutely not, man.

Absolutely not.  -No.

Why?   -No. Why?

Why? Just...  .  -I love you. I really..

I love you, but I cannot fucking stomach you.

This is fucking disgusting. It's disgusting

It's disgusting?   -You're disgusting!

You're fucking heartless! -What?

It's fuckin' nuts!

It doesn't even make any sense!

I'm the eldest boy! -God!

I am the eldest boy! -You're not.

And, you know, it... this... it mattered to him.

He wanted this to go on.

Well, I mean, she's the bloodline, though

What? I'm the... I'm the bloodline. We're all the fucking bloodline

No, I just mean if you're gonna play that card

Dad's view was yours weren't real.

What the fuck did you just say?   -Well, just not real-real.

Rome...  -Well, that's just what Dad said

I'm just saying what Dad said

Well, don't say it. You fucking cuck.

They are a pair of randos.

One is a buy-in

the other is half Rava half some filing cabinet guy, right?

You...

What the fuck?

Let go of him! -What the fuck did you say?

What the fuck are you doing?

Stop! -What the fuck did you say?

Fuck's sake.  -You have no kids

Shiv, don't! Don't do this! -Okay, hold on. Hold on a second

Get the fuck off me! -She's fucking pregnant

you piece of shit.  -Get off me!

Jesus Christ!

Are you fucking kidding me?

Shiv, no! Wait!

Shiv,  Wait!

Fuck you.

Can you just fucking leave her?

Fucking child.

Let's hit... let's hit Frank.

Let's offer Frank

We can still... we can still do this

Bullshit, man. Come on. It's fucking nothing. Stop

No, there... there's something here.

There's an angle.

No, no, it's fuck-all, man.

It's bits of glue and broken shows

fuckin' phony news, fucking..

Come on.

We have this. We can still do this, man

Oh, my God, man, it's nothing. Okay? It's just nothing.

It's fucking nothing. Stop it

Seven, six.

You don't have it.

We're good.

Okay.

So, what are you thinkin'? Golden parachute?

Or one last rodeo.

What do you think?

I'm thinkin' they should have slit his throat in the cradle.

Well, I mean, goes without saying

I'm thrilled for you.

I appreciate you.  -Let's fuckin' do it

Please, let's talk.  -Hey, man

But I got you.

I don't need to be talked into that.

We need you to come in right now

to complete this ceremony.  -I just need.

Bring me the piece of paper and I'll sign it.

If we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it at the desk
