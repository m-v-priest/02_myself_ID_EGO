...to prevent this certification of election results

until all absentee ballots are tallied

Meanwhile, Jimenez supporters are making their voices heard

in a number of demonstrations around the country

including outside the Manhattan offices of ATN

who first called the election for Jeryd Mencken.

Crowds of angry protestors

continue to make their way towards ATN's headquarters.

With reports of a number of instances of street violence and intimidation

NYPD is urging the public for their own safety.

My father, Logan Roy, was a great man

in the true sense of the word

Born the middle child of three

he was sent away during the Second World War

To… bing bang bong

Sad...

I look good, I look good

I am the man, I am the man.

As you can see, here I am

talking loudly about my father

And don't I, perhaps, remind you of him, just a little?

A little dry.

Chicago Daily,'81

Launches The Correspondent

A passion for human communication

am King Dong

I am the King of Dong

Bow down to me.

I selected the President.

Do you see his pecker in my pocket?

End of the first marriage, it's very sad, saddy, sad, sad.

Look out.

See Shivvy cry, see Kenny lie..

see Roman the Showman light up the sky

Last days, new adventures

Was he, may be, tiny, nice voice, losing it a little?

Who knows? But a great man.

His demise was carried, written in fire

pulsed electric in a flash

over seven continents

into newspapers that he started

networks he launched

through fiber he laid

satellites we built

A great man indeed

A great, great man.

Father, with your permission?

Applause all around. Come on, let her rip.

We love you.

Something.

What's up?   -Rome, hey, man. You okay?

Yeah. I'm okay. I'm good

I'm actually, like... Honestly, I'm excited

Does that make me a sick fuck?

Mencken wins, he blocks the deal

It's, you know, it's exciting times, interesting times

Do you think, you know, for business, for everything...

can we may be get Jerryd to turn the volume down a little?

Oh, come on. Don't be a pussy, dude

What, you don't like these fucking ratings?

It's discord, man.

Discord makes my dick "hord.

Sure. Just...

I mean, it is the funeral

Oh, he'd fucking love it. Are you kidding me?

You know, I don't know. Just a little Queasy Gonzales?

Yeah... We're all busy. Okay. We'll see you at Shiv sky's, right?

Okay. Hey, Rome, I'll... I'll see you there.

Okay.   -Roll deep

Hey.   -Hey, Ken. Listen, I... I just want to say that I am concerned, okay?

Everybody's saying that there's gonna be

Thank you.   -No, yeah. Rava, that's... that's rumors.

Okay, I'm with Fikret.

I'm gonna go with the sibs, but he'll pick you guys up and.

Okay. Yeah, no. Ken, listen, I think we may…

I think we're gonna head up state today

What?   -And I'm... I'm really sorry

but that is... that is my decision, okay?

We're gonna go to Travis and Robert's...

What are you even talking about?

Ken, it... it just... It does not feel safe today, okay?

This is just what we need to do, all right?

Where are you now? Are you... are you on the road?

Have you left yet?   -No, we haven't left, but we're...

Fikret, I wanna be at Rava's in three minutes, okay?

I'll figure out fines and violations. Just get us there now.

What a shit show, huh?

Okay, are you watching?   -Yeah, yeah.

I reckon you should get your bad numbers out

because it's just become an amazing day to bury bad news.

Yeah?   -I don't know.

Like, if you have a little dicky

maybe you don't go to the nudist beach?

Lukas.   -Yeah?

A tsunami just came and washed everything away

No one is checking the dicks. Just...

Seriously, I know this. Do it. Get them out.

You're so forceful.   -Yeah.

Well, how do we get around Mencken?

'Cause this... this is real, right?

That he's blocking the deal over regulatory.

Well, I don't... I still don't see it

You know, he's...

He's out of tune with some... some deep sentiments in this country.

Yeah, well, you've been a democracy for, like, 50 years, so...

What? No, I mean... Well, okay.

No, not unless you don't count black people

which is kind of a bad habit, so you...

Okay, yes, but it's a little more complicated than that.

I'm just... I'm just saying

You... you are nearly as mature a democracy as Botswana.

So, I should reach out. How did that go, by the way?

I... I still think cleanest is just activate.

Can you talk to your buddies and... and get the algo

you know, pushing that straight dope?

You know? All right, well, I gotta go.

But he's gonna be there today. Yeah?

So, get Ebba to bury those numbers

It's just so golden.

What are you doing? What do you think you're doing?

Ken, Ken.

Ken, what are you doing?   -What the fuck is going on?

We are just getting out of town

You're getting... Well, that's hysterical bullshit

Okay? You're not... you're not bringing the kids

to their grandfather's funeral? Are you insane?

I don't consider it safe

You're... you're too online.

Okay? You've lost context.

Everything is fine

Nothing is fine.

You said things would be okay. You said that Daniel would win.

Our daughter is not fine. You can't go.

Nothing is fine. You don't...  You can't go.  -Get out of my way.

Do not fuck with me today.

Ken...   -Do not fuck with me today

You need to stop. You need to calm down

Ken, Ken...   -Hey, guys. Soph? Open up

Ken. It's okay

Ken, you've got to stop this. You've gotta stop.

You've gotta stop. I do not consider it safe.

Okay?   -That's bullshit. Pretext.

You're trying to hurt me.

It's my fucking father's funeral.   -I'm really sorry, okay?

But we are gonna go. And there will be a memorial.

He didn't want a memorial.

He didn't want a memorial.

I'm gonna go to court

to get an emergency court order to stop you leaving the city

That's what I'm gonna do.   -Okay. Go do that

Okay?

I'm gonna block your car.

I'm gonna lie in front of your fucking car.

Okay? You're gonna have to run me over if you wanna go.

What are you gonna do?

Who... So, who gave them the timeline?

Well, a lot of people know.

A lot of people don't wanna go to The Hague for war crimes.

Look at you.

Well, there's not much of me, you know?

There's a great big graphic of Darwin.

I think that this diminishes my role.

I'm tarred with the Mencken brush

So I might, may as well get my goodies, right?

There's no point joining the party unless you get your little dacha.

I said two minutes.

I did say two minutes. Thank you

What?

No, no. I just.

The funeral, right? I mean,

I feel the need for closure.

I would like to grieve, I would like to.

Oh, I do, I do, too. I do, too. I'm a wheelman.

I'm a casket wheelman. I'm front right

It's

Fine, fine. Fuck off

Fuck off. Go on.   -Thank you.

Save me a place, though. A good place.

Okay? Second row.

And tell the Mencken team that I made the call, okay?

Tell Mencken that I swung it for him.?

And you may as well walk 'cause it's gridlock

Okay, now come in. Thank you

Hello.

Party time.

There you are.

Is he gonna come today? Mencken?

Is Mats son?

Doesn't know when he's beat. You should be pleased

Mencken wins, blocks the deal, we stay in charge

Yeah. You do.

Well, the idea is family, so..

Big picture, yeah.

Yep, it's just a great fucking day

You okay?

Yeah. Yeah, good.

I don't know.

Rava's taking the kids out of the city

She's concerned, so..

Well, that's dumb and shitty

I'm sorry, Ken.

Yeah. Well.

It's fine. It is what it is, right?

You guys get Mom's invitation for a " Caribbean air clear "?

Oh, Mom just suddenly wants to Mom now?

Yeah, I'm a hard no.

Right.   -Yeah.

I should tell you

cause I'm telling Mom today, probably, so.

I've wanted to say for a while

I'm actually... I'm pregnant

There you go.

Is it mine?   -Yeah.

Really? Fuck. Shiv.

And...

Yeah, it's Tom's. Not..

Good.   -Fuck's sake.

Yeah.   - Congratulations.

Yeah, you're having a Wambs gland.

I thought you'd just been eating your feelings

Yeah. Thanks. Good stuff

You know I'm not gonna stop with the joke things.

I'm also, like, if I see you breastfeeding

am gonna have to jerk off

Jesus fucking Christ, man.   -I... I mean that because it will be hot.

Do you know how disgusting you are?   -Do you love it?

No.   -Should we bone again?

No... fuck off.   -Kid number two?

Guys, can... can we..

Today, shall we, for the funeral, just..

Yeah? Cool it?   -Like a funeral truce.

Yeah, like, today is just about today

Hey, Jess, you're on speaker.

Listen, so, they're... they're saying that there's, like, a... a gathering

or like a... like a march or something...that's gathering from the park

and FDR's like, totally gridlocked

so, do you want me to just

Oh, wait.

I dropped a pin. I can guide you

Yeah.

Hi. Good morning.   -Good morning.

How you doing?   -Fine. Great. Swell.

Great day.   -Yeah.

So, yeah, I think from uptown, it's easier

but there's just, like, a lot of confusion, so.

Glasses, that's smart. You can cry in secret.

Hide all your emotions

and thus emerge victorious as the winner of the funeral.

Hey, Jess, listen.   -Yeah.

Early next week...   -Okay.

I wanna speak with some family lawyers.

Custody. I want custody.

Okay.   -Okay?

Monday, Tuesday. Let's do.

All right.

What's this? What's this meet with you?

Oh, don't worry about that. Just...

Okay. But let's... let's bump that.   -Yeah

So... So, what is it? What is this?

Yeah, shall we just do it when we do it?

Like, what is it?

I just wanna talk about my... situation

Okay. Sure.

What about your situation?   -Ken, this is a big day

I don't wanna do this today.

Yeah, well, now I'm thinking, like, all kinds of things.

So, come on. What?

Well, you have always been so supportive of me -Yeah.

and my aims and ambitions and I really appreciate that

So, I'm sure that you can understand

that it might be a good time for me to move on to another position

Okay. Okay.

Fine. Fine. Of course. Of course, you can.

Great.

Yeah, and we can chat more about it when we...

Can I ask why?

Yeah. It just..

feels like time, you know?

Is this about Mencken?

Well, I've been thinking about it for a while, so...

Fine, fine.   -I'm sorry.

Yeah

I just have to say, like, like.

It's, like, kinda... it's kind of ridiculous, Jess, though

I mean, if you feel sorry about it

maybe you should reconsider.

I just think that it's time.

I'm sorry, but I've... I've given you extraordinary access.

Where else are you gonna get that?

Nowhere.

I'm telling you, you're gonna get that nowhere

You have no idea how things will turn out

and it's very juvenile

It's fucking dumb. You're being dumb

Everybody's being fucking dumb

Okay, sorry you feel that way, Kendall

Nice timing, Jess. Lovely day to tell me.

Really thoughtful.

Ken. GoJo.

Mats son has slipped out

that they've got deeply bullshit subscriber numbers

all across South Asia.

But that's not for now.

Well, you are, in fact, telling me now, right?

Yeah, but it's not for you to engage. It's just.. just so you know.

Weather could have been a lot worse for this, huh?

Okay, well, this is... I thought that we were gonna..

Roman was doing the eulogy, Con

But we said we could consider, if we wanted to.

Yeah. Sure.

But this is long, and it's hard to follow.

Right, well, it's formally inventive.

That's one of the things that we like most about it

Okay, well, I think this eulogy's gonna leave us open to legal action

All right, so who have you hit?

Who have I hit?   -Yeah.

Okay. Well, just, you know.

because I think it's great that Mencken's a racist

and he won't let a dirty foreigner buy the company

but I still think we need to-get the board and brass

rallying around the old orphans here, don't you think?

Sure. Yeah, sure, dude

Okay.

Marcia's look in'chic. Yummy

She's a sexy funeral lady

If you're weirded out by that

wait'til I have sex with her on Dad's coffin

It's so fuckin'weird

The eulogy is good, right? He did good?

Yeah. He's on top of the world

Target-rich environment,

glad-handing the sad faces

Oh, man.

So many fucking money-changers in the temple

Hey, there he is

Frank, just wanna say I know we've had our battles and such

but this really puts it in perspective, don't it?

Sure. Life is short. We should all love one another.

Right.   -Go on.

Nothing. Just..

Just an observation

Mencken is going to block the deal

And if Ken has lost his stomach for the fight

which I really hope he hasn't

if there's gonna be one cherry on the cake

well, I'll be, you know, rounding up a posse.

Okay. Well, lovely chatting

Yeah, you are tied to two dirty little fuckers.

Hey, hey, Rome.   -Gregory.

Hey. Sad day. Sad day.   -Oh, yeah, yeah

Thanks.   -So... so, Mencken's right there.

Yeah, I know. I'm aware.

Yeah.   -So, can you get me an intro?

To Mencken?   -Yeah.

Can you... I mean, I'm... I'm one of the... I was one of..

I'm amongst the crowning committee, so..

Right, okay. Yeah, may be. Later

You're on Ewan watch, okay?

He wanted to speak

but unfortunately, there was no time

so if he starts, like, unfurling a banner

or, you know, singin' union songs or whatever

you have license to..

You know?

If you promise me a link-up with

Oh, sure. I'll... Yeah. Absolutely

All right. Nice trade.

This is it, huh?

He's gone. He's really gone

How much of you is glad?

Well, I mean, we had our fights, okay, but.

I miss him.

Stockholm Syndrome.   -Well..

Crossed with a little bit of China Syndrome

Okay, whatever.

Well, here she comes.

Thought I could hear the sound of Dalmatians howling

We freezing her out or what's.

I don't know, one down, may be

be nice in case she drops dead of a broken heart?

Or not having a heart

True. Well, it's her big day

Hi.   -Hi, darling.

Are you... okay?

Yep.

Yes?

Yes.   -Blimey.

I know.

Well, I never.

Well, then, you..

Well, well...

Thank you?

Exactly.

Well, we can get into this later, but.

didn't think to let me know?

I have to be careful the information that I give you

because you might use it against me.

No? Am I wrong?   -Mam, mam

Sweet one.

Peter.   -Good day

Peter's incredibly excited

I think he's brought his autograph book

Hello.   -Oh, so sad

Hi.   -So sad

I'm sorry.   -Thank you

Daddy's here.   -Thank you

Sorry for your loss.

I'm so sorry.  -Thanks, Peter.

Well, he spoke of you often

Did he?   -You were one of his favorites.

I'm going to... I'm just going to, darling..

Would you excuse me just for one second?

He's now going to roll around like a Labrador

in a lovely pile of senators

How respectful.

Yeah. Well, then...   -Will he come to Sweden?

So, the numbers pieces are starting to come out.

No significant blowback, right?

No. So far, it's... pretty good, right?

Good. Yes.

So, gold, gold star for the red devil

Good job.

Now, what are you thinking about the handsome Nazi over there?

Figure he's gonna win?

And, if he does, like, ironically

would that be bad for a tall, blond, white guy?

The whole thing is unimaginable, but...

I did have one idea, if he does come through, Mencken

Yeah, I mean, I was wondering if it would be smart

rather than just to walk away

what about you offer him a US CEO?

Yeah? Just for the US properties.

Let him have that win, in the media sense.

Yeah?   -Okay.

Well, if I offer him an American CEO.

who, like, who would you have in mind?

Oh, I mean, I don't know.

Anyone.

Yeah. Anyone.   -Anyone.

Yeah. Okay

I mean... Actually, you know who would be good?

I don't know who would be good

Shiv Roy.   -Shiv Roy

Yeah.   -Okay.

Very inexperienced, though, yeah?

Well, political acumen, knows ATN, can control the narrative.

Just very, very fucking clear-sighted

Besides, I also hear, apparently

the chairman, that sad Swede?   -The sad Swede

Basically pulling her strings anyway

They say she's Lukas Mats son's total puppet.

All right.

All right, well, you know what I've heard?

That she's..

Is that true?   -Yeah, well, you know.

She's one of those hard bitches, right?

Who's gonna do, what, 36 hours in maternity leave

emailing through her vanity cesarean.

Poor kid will never see her.

A hard-ass. Okay, I get it

Yeah, not widely liked

Well, what do you think?

Would he buy it?

'Cause you two are very hate y-hate y with each other, I hear

You think you could get him to like you?

Yes.   -You think?

Yeah.   -Okay.

Can you intro?

I can do fucking anything. My dad just died

Okay. He's... he's here

The headline act. Shall we?

Okay

Showtime. Thanks for comin'

Of course.   --We'll talk.

Kerry?

It is Kerry, isn't it?

Yeah.   -Not Kelly. Yep

Why don't you come and sit with us?

Yeah... yeah, you're... you're sure that's okay?

Absolutely. Who is this?

Oh, this is my brother and my friend

Sorry.   -Just going to steal her away

She'll be safe with me.

My... my friend, who's a... who's a lawyer

cause I thought that there might be an issue

in terms of entry or something.   -Oh, silly

Sweet.

Are you all right?   -Yeah. I'm..

Sally-Anne.   -Caroline

Hello.   -Hello.

This is Kerry. Sally-Anne.

Hi, Kerry.   -Hi

Come and meet Marcia.

Yes.   -Marcia, this is Sally-Anne.

Hello, Marcia.   -Bonjour

Sally-Anne was my Kerry, so to speak

So, it's all water under the bridge now, isn't it?

Shall we go and pile in?

What is Kerry doing in the front row?

She's in the front row.

God, Logan would hate this.

At least he won't grind his teeth tonight

Okay, dude. This is it, final call

Logan is boxed and ready to be delivered

Greg, there are fires in Baltimore.

Darwin might resign. Online i s peaking. You know?

I'll get there as fast as I can. And tell them it was me.

Can I inquire about front right?   -Okay.

Tom?

It's gonna be fine.

Hey, hey. Hey, Lukas.   -Hey, sexy

Nice to see you. That's very kind.   -Me too.

Shiv, I just spoke to Tom

and it looks like he's not gonna make it

What?   -Yeah.

Where's... Where's your Tommy boy?

He's at work.

It... Lot of news today

Yeah, he's in the grindhouse.

Sadly, that means that there's a wheel free on the casket

You're down a wheelman

Peter could take a wheel

What?   -A wheel? Yes, certainly

Do you need a spare pair of hands?

No, no, I was saying that Tom just kind of offered it to me

Oh, I see. Tom. I misunderstood

Yes

No.

Please stand

Into your hands, Father of Mercies

we commend our brother Logan

in the sure and certain hope

that together with all who have died in Christ

he will rise with him on the last day

Please be seated for a word

from those who knew and loved Logan best.

Greg...   -Hey, Gramps. Hey.

What are you doing, Grandpa?

Dad.   -What?

Don't do it. You're making a scene.

I'm not making a scene, Greg, you are.

Hi, I think maybe you're not on for today?

Thank you. I'm going to speak

Gramps, can...

Fuck.   -The fuck, Greg?

What do you want me to do?

You want me to take his legs out?

Thanks.

Good morning

It's okay, just so you know.   -Shut up.

It's not your fault. Don't tell me to shut up.

What sort of people would stop a brother speaking

for the sake of a share price?

I'm sorry.

It is not for me to judge my brother

History will tell that story.

I can just give you a couple of instances about him

You probably all know...

we came across the first time, during the war, for our safety

But the engines of our ship let go

and the rest of the convoy sailed on without us

Ieaving us adrift

They told us..

They told us children..

that if we spoke

or coughed or moved an inch

that the U-boats would catch the vibrations through the hull

and we would die in the drink, right there in the hold

Three nights and two days, we stayed quiet

A four-year-old and a five-and-half-year-old

speaking with our eyes.

So, there's a little sob story.

And once we were over, our uncle, who was

so to speak, a character, he.

Well, they... they had a little money

And they sent Logan a way to a better school

And he hated it.

He just hated it.

He wasn't...

He wasn't well. He was sick

And he me wed and he cried

and in the end, he got out and came home

under his own steam.

But when he got back

our little sister, she was a baby, but she was there by then..

she..

He always believed..

that he brought home the polio with him

which took her

I don't even know if that's true

But our aunt and uncle.

certainly did nothing to disabuse him of that notion

They let it lie with him.

I... loved him, I suppose.

And I suppose some of you did, too.

In whatever way he would let us

and we could manage.

But... I can't help but say..

he has wrought the most terrible things

He was a man who has here and there drawn in the edges of the world

Now and then darkened the skies a little.

Closed men's hearts

Fed that dark flame in men.

The hard, mean, hard-relenting flame

that keeps their hearts warm while another grows cold

their grain stashed while another goes hungry

and even has the temerity to tell that hard funny,

yes, funny..

but hard joke about the man in the cold.

You can get a little high, a little mighty, when you're warm.

Oh yes, he... he gave away a few million of his billions

but he was not a generous man.

He was mean.

And he made but a mean estimation of the world.

And he fed a certain kind of meagerness in men.

Perhaps he had to.

Because he had a meagerness about him

And maybe I do about me, too

I don't know.

I try.

I don't know when..

but some time, he decided not to try anymore

And it was a terrible shame.

Godspeed, my brother...

and God bless.

Yeah..

You okay?

You're gonna... you're gonna say the other side. Yeah?

Like, that's... that's not it. That's not everything, right?

Yeah. I'm good, I'm good.

I might hit on Marcia on the way up

Yep. Here goes.

You okay, son?

Yeah, I pre-grieved. Not your son.

It was a good hard take that you gave

One second

My

My father, Logan Roy, was.

Right.

He was a... a great man in the...

in the true sense... sense of the world... word

Fuck.

Guys, come here.

Yeah, no.

So, I can't do the... I can't... I can't do the thing

I actually can't do... I can't

I tried the thing and I just can't.   -Just take a second.

It's okay. Just take a breath

Hey.   --It's okay, it's okay. Just take...

Is he... is he in there?

Yeah.   -Yeah.

Get... get him out.

Hey... it's okay.   -It's okay

It's okay.

And I'm sorry

It's okay. Hey, hey

Just take a breath.   -Hey, it's okay. You're okay

We got you, okay?

Do you wanna..

-I...   -Yeah. Ken, will you..

Yeah, yeah, I think it's...'Cause you gotta...

You gotta say the other side

It's not, you know. Yeah.   -I got it, I got it

I got him, I got him.   -You got him?

Yeah.   -Sorry.

It's okay. I'l I just...   -Oh, it's stupid. I'm sorry

Do you guys have a pen?

No, -Yeah, yeah. Here.

I'm sorry that... I'm sorry.

No, it's okay.   -Yeah, it's okay.

I got you. I got you.   -You do... You got... Okay

Thank you.

Just bear with me a second, please

I'm gonna try to just stand in for my brother.

I think I just need water or something

Hey, Hugo. Can you get some fucking water?

Of course.   -I have some of his words

my sister's and my brother's, but..

Yeah, I don't know how much I know

but... I knew my father.

You know, I... I've said it, I said it..

And it is true, what I said, what my uncle said

Yeah? My father was.

a brute.

He was, he was tough

But also, he built..

and he acted.

And there are many people out there who will always tell you no.

And there are a thousand reasons. There... I mean, there always are

A thousand reasons not to. To not act

But he was never one of those.

He had a..

You know, he had a vitality

a force that could hurt

And it did

But, my god, the sheer, the..

I mean, look at it, the lives and the livings..

and the things that he made.

And the money

Yeah. The money

The lifeblood, the oxygen of this... this

this wonderful civilization that we have built from the mud

The money, the corpuscles of life

gushing around this nation, this world

filling men and women all around with... with desire.

Quickening the ambition to own and make and trade and profit

and build and improve.

I mean, great geysers of life he willed..

of buildings he made stand

of ships, steel hulls

amusements, newspapers, shows, and films, and life

Bloody, complicated life.

He made life happen.

He made me and my three siblings

Sorry.

And... and yes, he had a terrible force to him

and a fierce ambition that could push you to the side

But... But it was only that... that human thing

the will to be and to be seen and to do.

And now people might want to tend and prune the memory of him

to denigrate that force.

That magnificent, awful force of him,

but my god, I hope it's in me.

Because if we can't match his vim

then God knows the future will be sluggish and gray

You know, there was n't a room

from the grandest state room where his advice was sought

to the lowest house where his news played

where he couldn't walk and wasn't comfortable.

He was comfortable with this world

And he knew it.

He knew it and he liked it.

And I say amen to that

That was great. There's a...

The bit about the office.   -Yeah. Okay.

Sorry about that. Sorry. It just...   -It's okay

It's okay.   -That was good

That was good.   -Thank you

So, the... the way things have gone today

we have n't had a chance to.

And it's okay, Rome. And thank you, Ken, that was

Yeah, but we haven't said everything and so, I'm just gonna...

It will be done so on. Sorry.

My father..

We... we used to play outside his office

and I... I think because we wanted him to hear.

And he would come out, and he was so terrifying

He was..

Oh god, he was so terrifying to us

He'd come out, and he'd... he'd yell at us to be quiet

You know, this... this, " Silence!"

And what he was doing in there was so important

we couldn't conceive of... of what it was

You know, presidents and kings and queens and diplomats

and prime ministers and world bankers

And I don't know. Yeah, he...

He kept us outside.

But he kept everyone outside.

But... when he let you in.

when the sun shone..

it was warm.

Yeah, it was really... it was warm in the light.

But it was hard to be his daughter

I can't not..

You know, he was, it was.

Oh, he was hard on women.

You know, he couldn't, he couldn't fit a whole woman in his head

But he did okay.

You did okay, Dad.

We're all here, and we're doing okay

We're doing okay.

So, goodbye..

my dear, dear, world of a father.

Please stand

And we pray. Almighty God

that your servant Logan

may journey from this world...

Amen.

Thanks, Jess.

Thank you..

Hey, good to see you, good to see you.

Hey. Thank you

That was perfect.   -Thank you.

Talk later?   -Yes.

Thanks so much. Thank you

Take care.   -Thank you

We'll fill you in later, but very interesting conversation. Ebba.

Shiv floating a US CEO to placate Mencken.

Look at that thing. Jesus

He never sent you pictures? You never saw this?

Did he? No, I... I never saw this

Did you guys?   -No.

Yeah. He got it on a deal

Oh, man.   -He was really pleased

It was a..

It was a dot com pet supply guy who built it, I believe

What?   -But that guy decided against.

Yeah. Yeah.   -Really? Are you serious?

Was he in a bidding war with Stalin and Liberace?

Right?

Pop sort of.

I think he didn't wanna go in the ground

And I think he didn't wanna think about it too much

so I think he just went in for it at auction and, boom.

Cat food Ozymandias.

I think it was five mill all in.

But that's forever.

Yeah.   -Obviously.

Five mill?

Good deal.   -Yeah

Come on, I'll show you round.

Is it also a tax write-off? 'Cause it's technically a residence?

Yeah.

You interested?

Yeah, a chance to get to know him?

I'll have to talk to Willa

I was crazy for cryogenics, but yeah.

I wouldn't say no to a top bunk

You?

Man, I don't know.

Yeah.

I had trouble finishing a Scotch with him.

He made me breathe funny

...and wipe away every tear from our eyes

In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit

Amen.

Go in the peace of Christ.

You know, I'm intrigued to see how he gets out of this one

Man. Oh, it's too much, it's too much

Dad wasn't really.

How... How bad was Dad?

He was a salty dog. He was

But he was a good egg

What you saw was what you got

Yeah?

Yeah

Okay.

Right?

You okay?

Yeah. You?

I loved him very much. I miss him very much

He broke my heart

and he broke your hearts, too

Big H. How you doing?

Who? Little old me?

I'm fine. You know. Big day.

Yeah.

Come here. Listen.

I got something for you

I want you to brief media on background

Then I am the droid you are looking for

Okay? That Mats son's acquisition

doesn't have the support of key members of the family

But you don't say who.

Mats son's trying to steal the company for a song

Board is souring on the deal.

Okay, the feeling is, you know, Living Plus, et cetera

the price soaring post-election, ATN pumped

under values Way star, premium's too low.

Got it.

Got it?   -Yeah

You know, Hugo, life isn't nice.

It's contingent.

People who say they love you also fuck you.

So, this is an explicit plan to fuck the deal

me rule the world

And you can come

but it won't be a collaboration, okay?

You'll be my dog.

But the scraps from the table will be millions.

Millions.

Happy?

wang wang

There he is.

How you doing, big man?

Yeah

How are you doing yourself?

You okay these days?

Sure.

Cause I hear you were talking to a head shrinker

Supposed to be confidential

All right, well, I'm sorry.

Sorry, but I'm afraid it's not.

I mean, that's cool. It's cool. It's just..

People talk.

I got time on my hands, so.

Yeah.

Yeah, I tell.. I tell you what I think

I think you come work for me.

Like, big strong guy like you? What are you fucking..

What are you fucking gab bling about, huh?

I don't love it.   -No, I... No, I know..

I don't love it.   -Me neither, me neither.

Come work for me

Talk to me.   -Okay.

Talk to me. Yeah

Good.

Good man.

Always, always.

Ken.   -Yeah.

Mencken is here.

You wanna watch me scuba in his bullshit?

I guess, what

Sort of like congratulations

pending a grueling jurisdictional knife fight

Yeah?   -Yeah. No, no. Confident

Exciting. It's exciting.   -It is.

I hear you're harvesting names.

Kenton?   -Exactly, yes.

Yeah?   -Give them to Kenton.

Many thanks.   -Yeah, no worries.

So, yeah, I gues...

Given what we have, you know, on our side, you know...

how we've been pleased to cooperate in terms of shared vision

I guess I wanted to touch base.

Wanted to talk, chat, get my thoughts to you

Oh, I thought you were the sound system.

Now you wanna choose the track

No, I...  --Yeah, no, I mean..

Not one-way traffic

All right.

Like...

I don't know, when might you be dropping something publicly

about your regulatory concerns

vis-a-vis big bad foreign tech and great American corporations?

Right. Well, I've said I'll try to help

" Try to help "?   -Hello, sir.

Greg Hirsch.   -Hi.

ATN with Tom.   -Greg, Greg

This guy knows me well.

Congratulations.   -Thank you.

Tom and I were proud to be pull in'for you last night for..

But, yeah, Tom called it...   -Hey, hey, stupid

And I relayed the call, so...   -Fuck off, okay? Thanks

Why don't you piss off.   -Hey...

Take a hike.   -It's the Grim Weeper. Tiny Tear

Kidding. You good?

Hey, be easy today. Yeah?   -It's fine.

Hey, J Man. Hey.   -Hi. What's up?

How are you do in'? Hey, just wanted t...

Hey, thanks. Wanted to grab five just to...   -Con.

No, no, it's copacetic. It's cool

I just want to grab five, you know

just to talk macro Slovenia, micro travel budget

Con, Con.

I'm trying to talk with my colleague to bat some ideas

Like, what if I said to you

pan-Habsburg, American-led EU alternative?

What would you say to me?

Excuse me, Mr. President?   -Shiv, Shiv

If you care to follow me, I'm your extraction team.

Excuse me.   -We're just having a.

Perhaps you'd like to chat with Mr. Mats son.

Oh. Sure. I guess so.

Good luck, Mr. President.   -'Cause my thing is.

You know about Super mom's plan?

No.   -Maybe it's time to open up.

Big tent this shit.

Some motherfuckers I don't want in the tent.

No, I know that. I... Well, here we go.

Val kommen.   -Okay, perhaps we..

All right, I need you to find out where this goes

and how it lands, okay?   -Got it.

Okay, well, look at us.

A blonde, a brunette, and a redhead walk into the bar

Liberal, conservative, and whatever

What... what's your philosophy exactly?

Privacy pussy pasta.

Anarcho-capitalist parmigiana.

So, congratulations.   -Thank you

Very exciting stuff.   -Yeah.

Yeah, I'm gonna keep this brief 'cause we're both quite busy

But I..

I want Way star.

I want a piece of the news, I want sports

Archive, library, IP, talent, all that good stuff.

And I... I really like the deal.

So, what we would wanna talk about is

what would make you assuming you make it

what would reassure you about his ownership?

Okay, I just wanna be frank about

how important it is for me that you feel comfortable about this

I guess... No, no, the thing was... whatever our frictions

there was an ideological sympathy with your dad

My dad had deep ocean currents swirling in his gut

But I think on specifics

he was about money, winning, and gossip

Well, in terms of, like, across Go Jo and Go Jo socials

and all the kind of communication environment, whatever..

We're in this place where we are making the thing that everyone has

but nobody knows how it works.

Okay? And there's a very small number of people

that are thought leaders in that space.

And so, I just think that maybe you might wanna hear our take

You know?

It... it's also kind of fucking fun.

So, it's either a couple of tiny men in your pocket

or a gateway to broad and growing cultural influence.

Well, you know, it's really all about regulatory framework

CFIUS considerations, so yeah, muck about that.

It would be out of my hands, national interest and domestic..

Of course. Can I... Can I just say that..

Like, the stuff that I'm interested in

there's no need for me to be deep inside it on a day-to-day basis

So, for example

just spit balling here, may be an American CEO?

Would that help make things feel a bit more culturally aligned?

Perhaps?   -Oh, what?

Kinder, Kuche, Kirche over here?

I thought you hated me.

My dad was flexible, I'm flexible. I know how things go

And... you would be very glad, right? To see him win.

My feelings are irrelevant.

Our audience loves Jeryd,

and so, I respect our audience.

And I love your audience.

Ohio.   -Oh, all right

Good talk.

Have fun with Ohio.   -Great chat.

Decided to turn up

Yeah. I can only stay for 20

It's getting a bit Tiananmen-y out there.

Ballsy. Jesus, a whole new Tom.

You would never have dared

not to come to his funeral when he was alive

Yeah, well, the thing about your dad is that

he's lost quite a lot of influence over the past few days

Yeah.

Thank you.

Excuse me?

Yeah, it's fine. It's fine.

I know it's fine.

So...

So.   -What?

What?

Are you going to explain? Ever? To me? What happened?

Why you didn't... and how.

And how?   -Yeah.

I mean, I wasn't expecting it

Yeah, I mean, I wasn't sure that I wanted to keep it

Then I wasn't sure that it was okay

But it turns out that, by all accounts, it is

So, why didn't you tell me?   -So.

Because it seemed so sad, Tom.

And... And we were in... a honeymoon phase and.

Yep.   -Yeah.

Taking the potential dad for a test drive.

Oh, fuck you.

Hello there, happy couple.   -Hey

Congratulations, Tom.   -Hi. Oh, thank you

Thank you so much. Yeah.   -Lovely news

Well done, you.   -Well, if it wasn't such a total fuckin'disaster

it would be a dream come true.

Well, I'm sure it will be wonderful

Are you all right about it, Shiv?

I mean, it's hard

Oh, no, I'm not gonna see it.

I'm just gonna do it the family way

Oh, right, right.   -Yeah

Oh, that'll work fine. If you don't see it, that's fine.

Yeah, I mean, they don't grow up emotionally stunted, do they?

I shouldn't think so. What do you think?

Caroline? Darling?   -Oh, sorry

Sorry.

Fuck me.

Your mom.

You learn to disassociate fairly early

Hey, I wanna...

Come here.

I wanna... I wanna say sorry..

for not being there

'Cause I.

I wanted to have been and.

But, I, you know, I'm so, so tired and I have...

I've been awake for so, so long and I..

just felt I couldn't leave.

You know?   -Yeah. It's okay

Fine.

And, you know, I was... I was the first one in there with him.

After he died.

I was.

So, I did say...

I did say goodbye to him

I did.   -Okay.

Good.

You're exhausted

Hey, why don't... why don't you.

Why don't you back to the apartment?

I can't...   -For a couple of hours

Just, you know, sleep

Sure?   -I don't care.

The people at the hotel know me, and I... I hate it.

I don't like it.

Just hide out for a while.

Okay. Thank you

It's a yes.   -Yes?

Yes.

From... Yeah?

Yeah.

Okay.

Great move.

Smart.   -Yeah. I think they're interested

And...

I think I can make a US CEO work

Great. Let's..

Let's make a meatball burger

Yeah

Good night.   -Okay.

Hey, bud.   -Hey a.

Are you okay?

Look at her. In her fucking pomp.

She's fucking glowing

All dope, one in the chamber.

Yeah. Listen, I might need your help, bro

Lukas and Shiv.

It's possible... There might be an accommodation with Mencken.

With your pal.   -No, no

Yeah.   -No, we have an agreement

and, you know, he's gonna block the deal

We don't have a lot of leverage at this point, right?

So, we might need to... to make some moves.

And I might need your help.

I don't...

I don't really feel so great at the moment

Yeah, I know. I know.

Sorry.

That's because you fucked it.

Jesus, man. What the fuck?   -No, it's okay, man. It's okay.

Look, it happens, it happens

You thought you were Dad, shot your Dad bit.

Holy shit, dude. Take it easy. Fuck

Yeah, you fucked it with Jeryd.   -No, I didn't fuck it

No, I didn't, because, you know, if he tries to, you know

welch on the deal or whatever to block then..

you know, we got him, we can fuckin'hurt him.

We have... we have ATN

-You know?   -Right. Well, yeah

So, I didn't fuck it, okay?   -He's got our dick in his hand

We should have his dick in our hand

I... I don't... Okay.   -Yeah?

I think...

We do?

I should've stopped it so I'm blaming myself

but it's on us, dude, okay?

We don't wanna say bye-bye to Way star?

We have to get fuckin' real and fight Shiv at the board

The Roy Boys versus Shiv the Shiv.

Okay?

It's okay. I mean, I've got it.

I have a plan, but I'm gonna need you to just...

Yeah? Help me here?

And we can do this. Okay, dude?

Okay? You fucked it, but it's all right.

Did you get this? Did you get it?   -What? No

I'll send it to you.   -What?

Who recorded it?

I think... I think it was Ray

Listen to this, he sounds like a sow

that's about to get the stun gun and knows it.   -Rome?

You're kidding me

No, this is circulating

Don't play that.   -Come on, guys.

A show of strength. It's circulating!

Oh, that's not right

I'm... I'm walk in'. Thank you, thank you.

Great. Jesus Christ

Hey, I wouldn't go that way. It's a bull run over on 5th

Okay, well, keep up the good work, okay?

Fucking kidding me

Fuck you.

Go home, go home. Fuck you.   -Fuck you, dude

Oh, fuck me? Fuck you! Fuck you, you piece of shit!

No fucking idea!

No idea! Morons!

Idiots. Fuckin' morons, all of you.

You're a stupid fucking idiot. You have no fucking idea.

Dude, move.   -None. Idiot. Morons.

Go fuck yourself!

Stupid fuckers.   -Fuck you, man

Oh, fuck you, you piece of shit

Get the fuck outta here

Don't fucking touch me, you piece of shit
