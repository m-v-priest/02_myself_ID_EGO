咋了 你觉得她想把自己分到的遗产全变成金子或石油吗\NWhat, will she put all her inheritance into gold or oil?
不 我只是... 不是 我...\NNo, I just... No, I...
听着 我知道只有特定的事情发生后\NLook, I know that, like, the trust only comes into play
才会上演信托戏码...\Nif certain things happen...
就像现在 他死了 或脑死亡啥的\NYeah, he's dead, or brain dead.
对 但我在想...\NYeah, but I was thinkin', like...
如果让老爸醒过来\Nwouldn't it be nice for Dad to wake up
我们所有人如他所愿把字签了\Nand for all of us to have signed,
不是更好吗\Nlike he wanted?
也就是说 示好\NYou know, like a nice gesture?

你他妈疯了吗\NWhat, are you fuckin' insane?
住手 住手\NNo! No!
他...\NHe...
不该是这样的\NHe doesn't deserve this.
太不公平了\NIt's just so unfair.
他是个... 好人\NHe's a great... man.

还给我提供工作\NAnd he offered me a job.
对吗\NRight?
他不该遭受这种苦难\NHe doesn't deserve this.

我一直想和洛根谈谈\NI'd been intending to talk to Logan,
我想向小西... 求婚\Nyou know, and make a... make a proposal,
很正式体面的求婚\Na very decent proposal, to Shiv.
其实很早之前就想得到他的祝福\NActually been meaning to ask for his blessing for a while,

右脑深处的出血\Na bleed in the deep right hemisphere
给丘脑和脑干造成了压力\Nthat put pressure on the thalamus and the brain stem,
所以导致了他的昏迷\Nand that's what caused a loss of consciousness.
所以呢 会做手术吗\NSo, what, do you operate?
这种深处出血情况不适合手术 尤其是老年人\NWe don't do that with deep bleeds, especially in older patients.
-他不老  -老弟 他才过了八十大寿\N- He's not an older patient. - Dude, he just turned 80.
但身体上 他就像\NBut physically, he's, like,
只有70岁 还很健康\Nstill in his 70s, and he's in great shape.

并不值得做手术\Nin situations like these isn't worthwhile.

肯 然后你却没有\NKen, and then you weren't.
我说 我们唯一确定的是\NI mean, the only thing we know for certain,

他说就是要再等一会儿\NHe said it was just gonna take a little longer.
可他那么说是为了礼貌\NBut he said that to be nice.
我觉得他的意思是\NWhat I think he meant to say was
他希望妈生的是个开罐器\Nthat he wished that Mom gave birth to a can opener
因为那个至少能有点用\Nbecause at least then it would be useful.
傻逼\NYou're a dick.

没有支持的话 老爸这么对你后\NWithout it, after what Dad did to you,
我们或许可以让法院来决定任何任命\NI mean, we could probably take any appointment to court.

-扯淡  -你的意志不够强大\N- Bullshit. - you're not emotionally strong enough,
-你还有成瘾问题  -够了\N- you have addiction issues. - That's enough!
我不全是这么想的 只是尝试转述老爸的话\NI don't think all that, I'm just trying to be Dad's voice.
厉害 真是个"超好的"印象\NBravo. It was an excellent impression.
我就想说我不会搅进来\NI just want to say I'm not getting involved.

其他董事会成员都不清楚原委\Nnone of the other boards members could see what was happening.
