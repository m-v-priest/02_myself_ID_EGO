Oh, could Logan just get five?

Welcome. How's your dad?

Oh, pretty good.

He hopes to make it in person to the next one.

-Oh, sure. Send him my best. -I will.

But still, you're here, and that's nice.

Thanks. I feel the same way.

Great. We're all over the fucking moon. -What is this?

-Yeah.  So we are in discussions to acquire GoJo.

Okay.

How advanced?  Oh, not that advanced.

Just getting to outline terms.

So pretty fucking advanced?

Well, we didn't wanna bother you until we have some protein.

But we didn't wanna ambush you in the boardroom.

We wanted to let you know in here.

But you are still ambushing us.

-No... We are not ambushing.

-Well, no, I mean...

if you jump out on someone on the road in the middle of the night

hit them on the head and shout

"I'm not ambushing you." It's still a fucking ambush.

I love my business.

But we've had our throats slit on ads for 20 years.

We're bleeding out.

Another five of cord-cutting

and we'll be dead on the fucking carpet.

This is a transformative deal.

Yeah, but, just obviously, this is not okay.

We were supposed to be inside deal-making.

Well, you know, we're moving very fast

and it's all very sensitive,

but I assure... -I think they're assembling.

-Right. Shall we?

Okay. How will you feel if Matsson starts micro-dosing

and tweeting about angels again?

Matsson's a visionary.

Sure. Because he's trippin' balls.

Well, he has a team we can do business with.

This is bigger than anything you've ever contemplated.

It will reshape the company entirely.

Well, if you guys really, really don't like it...

sure. Kill it.

Well, we didn't say that.

So? Shall we? Finally?

Wait, where is Shiv on this? Why isn't Shiv here?

Oh, because this is just inner circle.

That's a joke, I'm kidding.

I think the President will be joining us, so...

-Yeah? -Hey. So...

I think they're gonna eat it.

Sandi is processing, Stewy loves it,

Roman led. No Karl, no Frank.

Sandi wants your take,

Gerri's trying to fill your boots

but I don't think Sandi's buying it

and I'm just following them now to the boardroom.

You in the car?

No. I'm gonna call in.

Well, that works. Is everything okay, honey?

Yeah, I just...

I'm feeling the way I was feeling still, so...

What about your mom's wedding?

I'm not feeling great,

so there's nothing really to say.

Right.

Well, maybe you don't even really need to go.

To Mom's wedding?

Oh, yeah.

fuck that, I'd never hear the end of it.

Can you imagine?

So, the board members not physically available

will be joining by phone

including Siobhan Roy, who sends her apologies

she's working on strategy.

And Kendall Roy...  -Hey.

-Hey.  And Kendall Roy who's not attending due to illness.

-And we're gonna lead off... -That's not actually true.

And we're gonna lead off with an update

on the promising developments in the ongoing investigation

from which portion of the meeting

Kendall and Logan Roy are recused. Hence...

and then we'll move on to discuss acquisitions.

Is he gonna watch?

I feel like I'm taking a shit in the Guggenheim, y'all.

Could we make a note in the minutes that he's watching us?

Hey, I know you.

Didn't you used to be Siobhan Roy?

You sounded dumb at the board meeting.

At least I showed up. What were you doing?

Brunching with some other sock puppet girl-boss presidents?

You haven't got a date?

Did no one on Raya wanna come to Italy and sit on your Ricotta dick?

So? Just to say, I had... Peter Onions rat-fucked.

Oh, what a lovely wedding present.

The guy's a fucking slime badger.

Three bankruptcies, two marriages, four children

and five shell companies.

He's a big investor in shitty nursing homes

tipping applesauce down their gullets

and telling them they had a four-course dinner.

-All the hits. -Yup.

So, I've asked Mom if we can talk to her

and I think we should do it together.

Do what?

"Do what?" like...

ask her if she should be doing this, you know.

It's like, five months since Rory was supposed to move in.

Whatever.

Or we can at least

check that she's getting a prenup.

You know, there's a lot of shit in there from the divorce

the holding company and everything.

And the guy is clearly on the make, so, yeah?

fuck it.

So... fuck it?

Yeah.

She's probably in sexual thrall to him

he's driving her wild with his sugar dick

and so there's nothing that we can do.

All right, fine.

Let him kill her for her emeralds

and screw us out of the fucking firm see if I care.

Hey, Rome? About the deal?

I was talking to Karl and Frank.

Yeah, no, but you're not really a part of that, either of you.

Well, I am.

Well, I can't quite fire you yet, Shiv

because I'm still a little bit scared of you.

But my thinking is when I take over

I'm gonna put you in the office next to mine

and you're gonna be my sexy secretary.

The fuck is wrong with you?

I dunno. We're working on it.

Ongoing process.

-Welcome. Follow me. -Let's go.

Just a minute.

-Hello. -Hey, Mom.

Hello, welcome all.

Goodness me.

Did you just come back from the front?

Yeah. Just felt like it.

It's dripping down.

It's nice.

Hello, darlings. How are you?

How lovely to see you.

Don't you look lovely?

So, you're all going to be taken up to the house.

-I'll be there in a minute, guys.

You look rather tired.

Thanks. You wanted a word?

Right. Yes.

So listen, what I wanted to ask you

you'll see when you go up to the house

that Peter has printed out

this awful sort of itinerary of events.

Welcoming and the rehearsals,

and the ceremonies, and...

And

I wondered if we couldn't slightly divvy them up?

-As in?   -As in...

your father would rather not as I understand it,

be together with you as far as possible.

And so,

what is your son getting

and what is your ex-husband, who you hate, getting?

Please don't get on your high horse.

It's not me, I don't mind. It's

"Bridezilla."

He's got his heart set

on having all the important people at his wedding.

-He's such a little tart.

-Well, I don't know if that works.

Please, have a think.

And I'll still see you tons.

Yeah?

Peter!

Come and say hello to Kendall.

Kendall, like the mint cake.

-Yeah. Pleased to meet you. -Absolutely.

Okay. Mom, I'll check the schedule,

maybe see you next month.

-Come on, don't be so dramatic. -Nice to meet you.

It's gonna be about four hours, Kendall.

-Hello. -Hello.

Hello, I'm Gerri Kellman. How...

-I am Viola. -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you.

-This is very nice.

What a place.

Italy! Pizza, pasta, and Popes.

You ever met the Pope, Con?

Yeah.

I met one,

couple of popes back, with Dad.

He was a real full-fat Pope.

Complete Pope.

Very religious.

I guess he really drank the Kool Aid, huh?

Wow. It's pretty.

Everything okay, Con?

Yup. Yeah.

Just

the guy from Politico... asking regarding his piece,

your full name and, like, your employment history

-and whatnot. -Oh, right.

-You think he's digging? -Might be friendly.

But, you know,

probably not. What do you think?

Yeah, it's probably friendly.

Because journalists are so fucking friendly

in my experience.

Okay.

Hey.

Going to the welcome drinks?

Sure. Let me just check on Laurie

and then you and I can put our heads together on the GoJo price.

It's ticking up, but nothing scary.

Laurie...

You just will not stop going on about him.

I think you're obsessed, and frankly, it's disgusting.

Laurie? We're gonna walk down.

-Can you catch up? -Yeah.

-Okay. -Okay. Cool.

Okay. So look,

I need to talk to you. Hi.

-I need to ask you something. -Okay.

I need you to stop sending me the items.

The which?

The dick pics?

-Don't want pictures of my dick?

-No.  Okay.

-Kind of offended. Are you sure?

-Yes, I'm sure.  -Okay.

-I'm fucking serious, Roman.

I'm not so sure, I feel like you do want them

but you're being kind of typically minxy.

I think this happens when you're under pressure or...

but you need to find some other outlet, Roman.

Look at you, trying to get inside my head.

Don't open Pandora's Box.

There's just more dicks in there.

Okay, she has a lovely house, quite.

Hey, mother. -Sorry.

-Roman! -Hi.

-Hello.

-Roman, you know Peter.

Yup.

Peter, Roman's worried in case I'm throwing myself away.

He thinks I'm in thrall to you.

Other way around.

Well, how you doing?

Very excited about all this.

Yeah, yeah, of course. Me too.

And how's business?

I hear you're big in the old Silvery Gulags?

Yes. Helping to turn around a nursing home group.

We... It's very rewarding.

Come in...

look at the operations, trim the fat.

-Yeah. -He means the nurses.

She's very rude. I don't know why I put up with it.

And I'm very rude to you too.

He is awful, I can obviously see that.

No. No... not at all. He's actually just your type.

Another in the line of post-dad posh, English phonies.

He's not posh. His father's a doctor.

Bought all his own furniture.

Yeah, he's a grasping little scholarship boy.

Well, take it easy there, Mother.

That's my stepfather you're talking about.

He's forcing me into all of this, this Toscana bit.

But he is tremendous fun. I mean, look at him

fizzing away over there like a bottle of cheap prosecco.

Very cheap.

Mom?

Well, you know that I'm not a big one for saying things

but I'm just gonna say, are you...

Are you sure? The guy has, like, four kids.

He's got a lot more than that, my darling.

Oh, great. That's fantastic.

There's a prenup though, right?

Oh, come on. Don't be so unromantic.

Mom, just... I'm concerned that maybe you're rushing this.

So what do you expect me survive on?

Macaroni and memorial services?

Excuse me for a second.

So?

Yeah, she says she can't

live off macaroni and memorial services.

Wow, poor old Eleanor Rigby wants to eat dick and drink champagne

for the rest of her life instead?

Yeah. Apparently we're meant to hate Peter

because he was smart enough to get a scholarship

and bought his own furniture.

What else do we got? Any requests?

-Any offers? -No, not really.

There's a sit-down,

like a podcast

that's basically like

ex-Globe journalists who are doing sort of like a...

kind of like the Kennedys.

Curse of the Roys, deep dive.

They're doing Connor's mom, and...

your dad and someone named Rose

and then the tabloid suicides.

There's like a kid who was bullied

and was it an accident or did he kill himself?

He was the caterer at your sister's wedding, I guess.

You know about this?

Sure.

Right, so they're spraying requests around the whole family.

Maybe

keep tabs on that one. -Okay? -Okay.

fucking bottom feeders.

So, unless it's weird, I might fuck off?

Yeah. Whatever.

Clock the fuck off. Okay.

Okay.

-Very nice. How we doing? -Yeah.

-Good, great. Yeah. -Absolutely.

-Yeah. -I'm great.

Oh, shit.

-Phone stuff. Yeah... -Yeah. Sorry.

No, no, go for it.

Well, congratulations, Greg.

Yeah. Punching above your weight?

Oh, Comfry?

Oh, yeah...

Yeah, I like her.

I do wonder...

Can you hold this?  -...is there depth there?

-Sure.  Like is... I don't... Like, is there substance?

Depth?

Oh, my God.

The man dying of thirst

is suddenly a mineral water critic?

Does Comfry not sate your lust for wisdom, Greg?

Such a shame Sontag's not still alive.

You could take her to the drive-though.

Maybe I wonder

when she gets to know the "real me"

will she stick around?

Well, I guess either way if doesn't work out,

she's a great date ladder.

Excuse me? As in...

Well, you know, people will see her with you.

And no offense, but they'll say,

"What the fuck's going on there?"

-"Why is he with her?"

-Yes. Yeah. Yeah, I'm aware of what you're saying.

-Yeah. Okay. -It still could work for you.

Date ladder. Play the date ladder game.

What about her?

She looks nice. -Yeah.

-Yeah.  -I mean, yeah, why not?

-She's pretty.  -She is very pretty.

-She is also a princess or a duchess or something,

but sure. Yeah.

-Why not? -What?  Why not?

We put a man on the moon.

-Okay. -Okay. Wow.

Poor woman, she probably...

She thinks she met a fun guy at a wedding.

He should be colored red like a dangerous lizard.

Oh, no, Scary Poppins is on maneuvers.

Can you, you know,

just block me from her?  -Blocking you.

You know, she knows that I'm not in a good place

and then it's all

house of flying daggers, you know.

-Sure. -"How's your marriage going?

-Are you gonna have children?"

-How is your marriage going?

Are you gonna have children?

Okay. Ha-ha.

Karolina.

Going to Macau, feeling lucky.

Tom. Matsson.

-What? Going to Macau? -The fuck.

Feeling lucky? What the fuck is that?

-You see this thing from Karolina? -Did you see this?

It's off the radar and now this?

Is this a move?

It... it could be...

it could be nothing, you know.

fucking social media fireworks.

Going to Macau, feeling lucky.

-Is he trying to boost his price? -Yeah.

Is he just rocking the boat or trying to blow up the deal?

I mean, has he got a good subscriber numbers coming in?

Maybe he's just going to Macau

and he's feeling lucky.

Maybe...

Hey, Lukas, call me. Are you high?

I think you should put down the venti ayahuasca Big Gulp.

We need to be inside track on these tweets, man, okay?

Call me.

I don't know, it's like it's his thing.

-He's a trickster.

-Okay. Well, sounds cool. Is he gonna, like,

steal our watches and saw the fucking deal in half?

Maybe.

You're supposed to be inside this, Rome.

I am inside this. Leave it.

Hey, nice work, Rome.

Hey.

Matsson going nut-nut.

Keep hold of that shit, bro.

It's all under control, motherfucker.

-Yeah? -Yeah.  Where are you off to?

Naples, score some junk?

No, just our mother throwing me out of her party.

-Oh, nice. Good.

Well, so long. -Where are my kids?

Hey, hey, guys, where the fuck are my kids?

What a surprise? Ken doesn't know where his kids are.

So look, I've been thinking...

who knows what'll happen...

maybe I won't ignite?

Maybe the two party system isn't as rotten as it looks.

But I have to plan for success. So, Willa...

this is a difficult conversation to have.

Oh, okay.

So you're okay?

Yeah, I don't... Just, no, go on and just...

We can go back underground, you know?

Me in my apartment in the city, you come visit.

-It's kind of romantic?

-That doesn't work for me. No.

-Okay. -Maxim had an idea...

which is...

will you make me

the most happiest man...

slash most bulletproof candidate in the world?

Oh, okay.

-Okay? -Oh, no, I... No, I mean...

Baby.

People are looking, Willa.

Well, then I'd be pleased to say...

yes... yes. Can I...

Can I have a little think on it?

If it's okay,

I'm smiling now.  Right.

Like you said yes.

Okay.

-But take your time. -Right.

So GoJo's price is moving up and fucking up.

Yeah. I think he played you, Rome.

SEC's gonna be all over this.

Oh, yeah, oh, my goodness

gummy love bite from the fucking toddlers.

I think he likes us, I do, I can feel that in my gut.

Okay. Another one.

Emojis, controller, fingers crossed, eggplant.

Maybe he's trying to fuck a gaming site something with...

Rome, this is bad.

-I... I think we're good.

-Oh, yeah? If he blows this deal, then who is left for us exactly?

We could become the fucking

Pan-American  Waystar-Blockbuster Video dial-up Corporation.

Okay.

Here he comes.

And here she comes.

He does not give a single

-No.  ...solitary fuck.

-No. -Maybe it's all fine.

Maybe they just share a big bed together

and they watch Friends reruns and drink milkshakes.

-Oh, hi. -Well, your father made it -it would appear.

-And you know the story?

What? The skunk, the porcupine, and the concubine?

Probably the best wedding present I'll ever get.

But so disgusting.

Is he still fucking Marcia, do we think?

-I think not is the word. -Hope not,

poor old fellow  would probably keel over with the effort.

Oh, well, I gotta go around telling everybody

to be very discreet.

Oh, and Shiv

you know about this awful thing later on?

Oh, yeah... Rome and I have...

Have got a big...we're working on a big deal

and so we just got hit by a torpedo

-and it's not okay, I think. -Oh, Shiv, don't be silly.

Go have fun with Mom, I can manage. It's...

She's not even that involved.

Yeah?

See you later.  You're welcome.

fuck you.  -Logan, you came.

-How you doing?

Staying ahead of the Inland Revenue?

-Welcome to Toscana.

-Oh, glad to be here.

Anything I can do, just let me know.

Very kind.

When we get the chance I wanted a discreet word with you

about your contacts in UK government.

It's just

I'd like to give something back, you know the chance to serve.

Logan.

And what did he want?

He wants me to get the dipshits on Downing Street

to make him Lord fucking Seat Sniffer Pantyhose.

-Did you read the tweet? -Yup.

-Have you spoken? -Tried, but...

I'm not used to negotiating via eggplant.

I'm not sure he wants the deal.

He might just run a fucking moussaka.

You want to try calling him again?

Okay.

As long as he doesn't come here.

-No. Hey, hey, you okay?

-Yeah. I'm okay. Hey, Dad.

Ken, he doesn't wanna see you.

He doesn't wanna talk to you.

-Yeah, this is all total horseshit.

-We had a deal. Jesus Christ.

Let's just have it out, okay?

I wanna see you, Dad, I wanna see you for dinner

and let's just nail this, okay?

8.00,

on your own. Yeah?

He's busy.

-Sure. -We'll get back to him.

We'll get back to you.

Oh. You'll get back to me?

You prick.

Should I go?

I don't know, maybe wear a stab vest.

I mean, it'll be okay. Maybe you should go.

Get him out of the firm.

-You want me to come with you? -Oh, fuck off.

I'm not scared. Get me some rooms

-I wanna get Matsson on the phone. -Okay.

Hello, welcome.

We're almost there.

-Hey,

I'm sorry. -Oh, hi.

Hey, just busy.

Managed to tear yourself away?

What do you think of Peter's daughters?

They're both in interior design.

They're unemployed.

Yeah. They offered to take photos

and I think they exported my address book.

-No. -Yeah.

God.

The bachelorette party.

My mother would turn in her grave.

Hey, Rome is kind of concerned.

You do have a watertight prenup, right?

Do you think he's gonna do me in for Granny's fake Rubens?

-You've got a good lawyer at least.

-Yeah. Sure. I'm actually having to open up the divorce agreement

with your father. because Peter loves Eaton Square flat.

Does he not got one his own?

He had a bit of bad luck

with a salmon-smoking business

and he lost his place in Pimlico.

Quite the business brain.

Got a very big heart.

Well, I supposed opposites attract.

Should we just enjoy a fag?

And not do any sniping for a bit?

Or have you come to get some attention?

Me? Attention from you? Oh, no.

That ship sailed long ago.

Yeah. I might have been a bit of a spotty mother

but you've been a shitty daughter, so...

You weren't a spotty mother,  you were just an

absence... but I'm fine.

I moved back to bloody New York so I could be near you

-and I never fucking saw you.

-Mom, it's okay.

It's fine,

you let Dad take us and it was probably best.

I gave him custody so you could keep your shares

and I could protect your interests.

You chose.

"I'll have the carbonara and Daddy, please."

I didn't choose anything.

You tend to get what you want anyway.

And you don't?

I don't think I've ever

won a single battle in my whole life.

I was ten, Mom.

I was a fucking kid.

You were 13...

and you knew how to twist the knife.

You knew then and you know now.

And I might cry.

Oh, yeah, where's the onion?

You were quite a piece of work.

You were my onion.

You are my onion.  Yeah.

Well, you're my fucking onion.

Truth is, I probably should never have had children.

You made the right decision.

Some people just aren't made to be mothers.

I should've had dogs.

-Well, you could've had dogs.

-No, not with your father.

He never saw anything he loved that he didn't wanna kick it

just to see if it would still come back.

Okay, what's this?

Okay, so your dad called a bunch

and Matsson won't take the calls.

Matsson hates the phone.

That's nothing, I told Dad that.

He left me a voice memo,

the tweets were just fucking around.

His lawyers have given him the Reg FD scares.

He's flying back to his Swiss place.

There's clarification coming.

Yeah. Well, your dad thinks

Matsson's trying to humiliate him.

Well, he's not.

So Dad just needs to ride it out.

I don't think we need to panic, Gerri. Okay?

-I'm not panicking. -I think you are.

Because you're interrupting a great night

I'm getting very pally with Laurie.

I might try to fuck him see how that

fits into our disgusting mess.

Do not try to fuck Laurie.

What do you think about going to see Matsson?

Yeah. Sure, does Dad want me to?

Yes. Your dad wants the deal.

But, you know, they need a translator.

Logan needs reassurance before the banker meet.

Okay, so you want me to save the deal?

Why didn't you say so? Piece of cake.

Save the deal, fuck Laurie

lead the company into the promised land.

fuck Gerri...

It's gonna be a great week.

I thought this was gonna be private.

I'm across a lot of shit

and she's monitoring.

Hang out wherever, you guys can wait inside.

So I hear you were asking all about the menu and my chef.

Some things are off the menu for me health-wise.

You scared I'm gonna try and Jim Jones you with an olive?

Well, I think they've brought some food

that's good for me.

Yeah. It seems a shame, you know, Marco's a great chef.

So we checked in with your doc and got the requirements.

So, what is all this?

You know, I got a lot to do.

As ever.

GoJo price is spiking and your pal, Matsson

has got a screw loose.

So

I just wanted to talk to you, I suppose.

Look, I don't wanna get into it all right now

because if it's bullshit, I'll just leave.

Can we be civil and not pull our guts out

all over the table?

-Sure.

That one's for him.

-Where are the kids? -They're inside.

Iverson.

I'd like to say hello.

Sure.

Hey, kiddo.

How you doing?

Good.

You like mozzarella?

Not much.

Try this.

There you go, try it.

Yeah. It's okay.

Off you go, go on.

Kerry has got something for you in there I think.

-Good night, buddy. -Night.

Who do you think I am?

You think I want you dead?

I'll be broken when you die.

How's the boy doing?

Is he getting better?

He's fine.

So look...

my thing is,

I want out.

I think I thought I was a knight on horseback

-but yeah, that isn't panning out.

-Life's not knights on horseback.

It's a number on a piece of paper.

It's a fight for a knife in the mud.

Like, I don't really know

where my life goes from here.

Maybe I could...

I don't know.

But I can't do Jack shit.

So, here it is,

I wanna get a premium payout from the holding.

Two bill and a chunky asset.

Something you can realize without shareholder input.

Maybe...

I don't know, outdoor advertising, podcasts...

I keep Fikret, Jess, and I'm gone.

I'm a ghost, divested, off the board,

complete disinheritance.

Won't even speak at your memorial,

we're done.

Well, I need to think about it.

Well, you already...

You offered at my birthday.

That was for fun.  Dad...

we can't do this bullshit forever.

Maybe I want you close.

You can do the mail, keep you rattling around.

I can't.

I tried, but I thought that I could change things...

but I'm not as...

There's things you're able to do that I can't,

maybe.

Maybe.

You've won...

because you're corrupt and so is the world.

Well.

I'm better than you.

You know, I hate to say this,

because I love you  but you're kind of

evil.

Don't talk about things you don't understand.

Well, you're smart

but what you've done is you've

monetized all the fucking...

The American resentments of class and race and...

And I thought I was just telling folks the weather.

You've turned black bile into silver dollars.

And you just noticed, did you?

Yeah. Maybe I did.

Oh, fuck off.

Fine, you know what?

I don't give a fuck.

Not everyone can live this life.

I'm a great revolutionary.

A bit of fucking spice.

-Bit of fun. -Fun.

A bit of truth.

Okay. Truth, okay.

I fucking know things about the world

or I wouldn't turn a buck.

-Maybe. -Not necessarily nice things.

Look, whatever,

let me out,

okay?

Pay up and let me out.

I don't wanna be you.

I'm a good guy.

How long was that kid alive...

before he started sucking in water?

Couple of minutes?

Three, four, five?

Long time, two minutes.

What were you even doing? Chasing a bit of tail?

Hey, are you queer?

Did you try to fuck him?

Or was it just the drugs?

-I'm better than you.

-Sure.

You're my son.

I did my best...

and whenever you fucked up

I cleaned up your shit.

And I'm a bad person?

fuck off, kiddo.

Goodnight.

We're out of here.

How was your night?

Awful. You?

Yeah. Roman implied that Peter might have killed his first wife

and then he tried to goad Laurie

into talking indelicately about Gerri.

Let's have a baby.

-Yeah? -Yeah.

-I'm gonna fucking fight, Tom. -Okay.

Yeah. You don't just get given these things

in a house in the fucking Hamptons.

-Right. Right. -No.

You know, just get given the top job, or ATN.

I'm gonna have to fight for it.

Gotta fight Gerri and Roman and Ken.

But I can because I'm smarter than them.

-Yes, you are. -Yeah.

I'm gonna fucking do it.

And fuck Dad, he can kick me as many times as he wants.

Like ten or five years.

Get rid of Cyd, remake ATN.

-Yeah. -And destroy it

-raze it to the ground, yeah? -Yes.

Right. I mean, except me.

-Yeah. -Yeah, except you.

You know, and Matsson's got Dad spooked.

So I'm gonna have to find him a better deal, a bigger one.

I'm gonna do it and I'm gonna fucking nail it, too.

And what...What about me?

what... and the...

Together. Yeah.

Because we can't let the dirty little pixie become king.

-No. -Yeah. Blow up Roman,

and I'm the only candidate left in the field.

Let's do anything, yeah?  -What do you...

-Yeah.

-What do you wanna do to me? -You're so fucking hot.

-You're so fucking hot. Just tell me anything,

do anything to me.

No, you

you say anything to me.

Go on,

Mistress

Siobhan Roy.

Go on.

You're not good enough for me.

Oh, right.

Oh. I see.

Well, let's see about that. Yeah.

No, I'm way out of your fucking league.

Oh, you think so? Yeah?

But that's why you want me.

-That's why  -Maybe.

you love me.

fuck you.

Even though I don't love you.

But you want me anyway.

Hey.

-You crept out. -Yeah.

Sleep well?

Oh, yeah. Really good. Lots of sleep.

I'm sorry for waking you to ask, but I'm curious,

obviously.

Yeah. No worries. Yeah.

Yeah, still thinking.

-Still thinking? -Yeah.

Big decision,

real life decisions

-so just... -Yeah.

-Right. -Thinking away.

Just, this much thinking could start to get unromantic.

-Yeah. -Just saying.

Hey. -Oh. Wow. -Hey.

Is that the time?

Excuse me?

Oh, just checking the old watch there.

I can't believe it.

What are you up to today?

-I don't know, work shit.

-Work?

Or...

Okay, because,

I thought, or I've overheard, actually that you...

not to intrude, or but...

But I thought maybe you were part of...

the whole...

the titled monarchical

sort of situation if that's not too bold to say?

No, sure  but I do a bit of,

I'm an online brand ambassador.

A fermented yogurt drink.

-Fermented yogurt?

-Yeah.  Well, I've had that.

Yeah. It's really good,

it's a gut cleansing treat.

-Is it really? -Hey, dipshit. Hands off.

Hey.

I'm just off to save the world. Should be back for dinner.

Greg,

would you please keep the Contessa company

but don't look at her. Everyone knows what you're thinking

and it's disgusting, bye-ya!

Sorry about him.

-Laurie, how the hell are you?

-I'm good.

-Good to see you. -Yeah. My cousin.

A very rude man.

GoJo price has lurched and held.

Power of the tweet.

Yeah. By midweek, their market cap is gonna be close to ours.

I don't think that Rome can find a landing zone for this.

You okay?

That was pretty spicy pillow talk last night.

Yeah.

-Yeah. You ready? -Yeah.

Thank you.

But it did... It got pretty...

it got pretty... You know, when you said...

"Say something filthy"

or "Do something dirty."

Mm-hmm?

Yeah. I was just being horrible for fun, you know, dirty fun.

No. It was dirty...

but this morning, you know, I feel a little...

A little afterburn, you know.

Like...

I was thinking

more like love beads or, you know,

I'd be a sexy fireman

and it was... kind of got into the realms

of that you don't love me.

Oh. Okay. Well, what happens in Sex Vegas...

Right, right, yeah.

No, I know, but then sometimes I think...

Sometimes I think should I maybe listen

to the things you say directly in my face

when we're at our most intimate?

Tom,

you can't...Oh, my God,

you can't ask someone to say terrible things

and then get all...

That's a bit manipulative.

-Right. -Yeah.

But did you mean it about the baby?

Yes. Yeah, I...

Yeah, I think so.

One way or another.

You know, we should freeze at least.

-Yeah? -Yeah.

You know, embryos survive way better than eggs. So...

we should

put it together and then see where we are.

Okay. And when do you think that might be?

Well,

I don't know, Tom. I mean,

it's important that

the host chamber is willing.

Well, they keep them for ten years and then

you can do what you want

but it's different if one of us dies

or is in a long-term coma.

And... No, that's what... It's true.

You decide beforehand

what you would want to happen and...

You know, I don't just automatically get them

if we divorce or something like that,

if that's the thing that concerns you.

No, I just...

I wouldn't have necessarily thought about all of that.

Well, I just think it's smart to bank some embryos

and then, you know, we can see where we are.

So we could be looking at, like, ten years?

That's like... Oh Well...

Ten years is like two and a half Olympics.

When you put it like that, it's...

No.

It'll get clearer. I just think it's a good option.

And then if something happens

or, you know, you change your mind they destroy them,

it doesn't bind you.

I would want you to have my babies if I died.

Thank you.

And if you died?

Would I want...

Yeah, I think so.

-Can I think about it? -Sure.

You know, Tom, I do.

I may not love you, but I do love you.

You know.

I know, I do know. I do know.

Well...

-baby popsicles,

baby. -Baby popsicles.

Don't fall in.

Nope

Do you want me to hold your hand?

Hey.

-Come on, I'll hold your hand.

-Piss off.

-Amazing place.

-Yeah.

-No?   -I don't know.

It kind of freaks me out to be honest.

Oh, yeah?

Well, when I got it, I wanted everything to be absolutely perfect.

Now, I'm sleeping on a camping mat

on the floor until I get a deep dive

on the best mattress in the world.

So...

-It's great. It's great, but... -Yeah.

I'm just not feeling great.

I mean, I'm fine.

-Well, but not really. -Okay.

Maybe let's leave the little feely-feelings out of it

because I'm gonna give you nothing.

-All right. -Nothing.

So you got a view here

-of the lake. -Sure.

-Water and boats. -Yeah.

-Have a gender. -A lot of water.

Hey, what are you worst at?

Me?

-Yeah. -Worst?

Success doesn't really interest me anymore,

it's too easy.   Uh-huh？

Like,

analysis, plus capital, plus execution.

It's fucking...

Anyone can do that.

But failure...

You know, that's a secret.

Just as much failure as possible,

as fast as possible.

Just burn that shit out.

-Well, I... -That's interesting.

...am not telling you

a single one of my weaknesses, ever.

Ever...

-Ever... -That's smart.

I know. I'm smart.

Because I ream people.

Juice them like oranges.

No, look, seriously...

I get way too into people and...

And then they disappoint me.

Hey, I'm

thinking of doing, like a quarterly up

or outs at the company.

-Oh, yeah. -Yeah.

Firing people is like 85% of why I get up in the morning.

But...

do wanna ask you about that tweet,

if you don't mind.

Oh  the

-That one? -Yeah. Seriously. Yes.

You got, like, big shit coming your way?

Dude, are you...

Are you asking me for material non-public information?

I mean, I don't know.

Were you trying to give your share price a pop

by tweeting unverifiable information

outside normal disclosure channels?

No. You're not allowed to do that.

-Yup. -So mean.

The thing I need to know is

do you want this deal? Are you into it at all?

-Yeah, I am. -Okay.

I'm just a little Swedish, you know?

-I'm into equality. -Okay.

I like getting into bed with people,

but I also like sharing it equally.

Okay.

Okay. It's just... I'm heading to Milan

to lock things down with Dad and the bankers,

and...

the tweet just didn't feel great.

And if you're hoping to just blow this whole thing up

just tell me, okay?

I just wanna get myself the best of everything.

Okay.

fuck yeah. I get that. Definitely.

-Hey. -Hey.

So?

-So I think it's over. -What?

Yeah, I don't think Matsson's interested in getting acquired.

I think he's angling for a merger of equals.

Okay. fuck.

-Well? -So it's dead, right?

-Are you sure? -Well...

I mean, I don't wanna pile on the pressure, Roman

and, obviously, there are always multiple ways forward

and I don't wanna overcook this but

in terms of deals that make sense

if we don't beef up soon, I think we end up someone's lunch.

Well, thanks, Ger.

I'm already so stressed I'm jerking dust.

You want to tell him together?

I'm not really inside the details, so...

Okay. Sure.

-Well, it was nice knowing you then..

-Yep

So before we get the whole three-ring circus in here

just among friends

I wanna get a sense of what's going on.

Is he a Twitter panty flasher?

Or is he a serious person?

Well, he is a serious person.

You're certain?

Yes, Shiv, he is serious.

But, Dad,

he thinks there's value that hasn't been priced in yet.

Matsson's gunning for a merger of equals.

So I guess, you know, that probably...

-Merger of equals?

-Yeah.  Like he's got 12 of the prime Asian sports leagues

signed up for GoJo and he's gonna fold it all in to the platform.

Live sports, games, betting. It's a fucking growth bomb.

Okay. But, full 50-50 board, all stock.

-Dad, what, splits control?

-Yes, Siobhan.

Well, I don't...

I don't think... Dad?

But the guy isn't a fuckhead?

No. The tweeting was a move.

Well, he's not some big baby who shits for clicks?

No. No. He's on the snake.

You know, I know people, Dad. I'm a people sniffer.

Because I can win any bout with a boxer fuck

but I don't know how to knock out a clown.

He's not a clown. He's a motherfucker.

It's what you would have done, right?

He just maximized his leverage.

Yeah, but "merger of equals?" Like...

-No such thing. -Always a top dog, right?

Sure. And I mean he wants the label

but I think we could still be the puppy fuckers here?

The family stake will be

seriously diluted.

I think he'd let us craft it so that

we keep balance of the board.

I think he just wants the freedom and the status.

GoJo Royco. I mean, who gives a fuck?

Let him have the logo, we take the wheel.

Yeah, I mean, it would be real scale.

It's a legitimate way of staying relevant.

It's a big upheaval.

Yeah, I mean the top team will...

You know, you'll be obviously be fighting for your lives.

But I'm sure you can trust Dad, guys.

Obviously.

Merger's really a state of mind, right?

Dad, Gerri, you stay with your hands on the tiller.

I mean, their price rise, it's real.

It's a proper fucking streamer.

And the future is

movies, TV, music, games, sports, eSports

VR, AR, betting, fucking everything,

for everyone  and Matsson knows how to get there.

Logan?

We can't afford to walk away right now.

Must be worth a conversation, son.

Bring them in.

Let's get the banker fucks in here on this.

Okay.

fucking A.

Right this way.

This is Tom Wambsgans...he's the Chairman of ATN News.

-Hi. -Hi.

-Hello. How are you? -Good.

Shiv Roy, President of Domestic Operations.

Sit wherever you're comfortable.

I need five.

Dad?

Jesus. fuck.

Yeah, that's his dick.

He's sent you a picture of his dick by mistake.

Well, it's pretty obvious.

Yeah, he meant to send it to Gerri.

I don't get it.

Well, honestly,

he's weird about Gerri.

Everyone knows it. And...

And, frankly, I think it's fucking disgusting.

-Yeah?

-Yeah. Yeah, Gerri is probably

just not stopping it for leverage.

You know, banking it as ammo.

Isn't he just Roman being Roman?

No.

No, I mean... No, I think it's

a potential problem.

There's issues, you know?

Everyone says they used to get jerked off by his personal trainer.

And now there's this Gerri thing.

It's a...

It's a track record, you know?

So I think, you know, moving forward

perhaps we should... Oh, okay...

Well, thank you. Thank you, Pinkie.

Go on. -Okay.

-Roman! -Jesus, fuck.

Hey, put in a good word for you.

Thanks.

Are you a sicko?

-What is this? -Oh, Jesus.

Why do you send them?   God, it's just, you know,

it's like...

"Here's my dick."

Oh, what? Like a fuck you?

People just send each other pics of their dicks.

People send each other pics of their dicks?

Yeah. Have you heard of dick pics, Dad?

Well, we do publish a number of popular newspapers

so yes, son

we probably invented the fucking words.

But why?

Why? I don't know.

It's just like, here's my dick, I guess.

You got a problem?

What happened to that nice piece of tail you were with?

Tabitha? Yeah, she's amazing.

We're having some issues

and...

What interests you in Gerri exactly?

Jesus, Dad. I'm fucking... I'm screwing around!

I don't like things going on I don't know about.

She's a million years old.

It's fucking disgusting.

You're a laughingstock.

Oh, go on, fuck off.

So like what happens now?

I don't want her hanging around like frozen fucking piss.

Gerri?

I'm not a radical feminist, Dad

but I think perhaps we should not fire her

for receiving pictures of my dick.

Are you gonna come back?

Sorry about all this, Gerri.

It's just something I wanna get...

you know, really clear about what's going on, you know?

And most importantly, to see if you're okay.

-It's not a big deal.

-Okay.  Yeah, I just wanna get things clear

for my dad, you know?

God, this must be so hard for you.

-It's fine. -Do you wanna...

No? Okay.

So has this or something like this happened before?

I can't recall.

And if it did, did you ask him to stop?

Let's talk about this tomorrow, okay?

I just need to check-in with some people.

Okay. Well, sure. I mean, it's not...

It's not as if you were welcoming

these items...

-were you, Gerri?

-Shiv.

Look, it's just something for your wellbeing

we need to get really clear about because,

you know,

with all this potential upheaval

and you being in such a delicate position as interim CEO

if you can't deal with your own sexual harassment

then it's not a good look.

I can cope.

Okay. So do you wanna make a formal complaint

against him regarding this?

-Well, that's for me to decide.

I just think, Gerri,

that you should report him to HR because if you don't,

it could be argued  that you welcomed these photos

and that just undermines your position.

It's just... That's my concern for you here.

I wonder if we shouldn't

just kick this all the way up to the board?

Well, thank you for giving this so much thought.

-And I'll think it over, okay? -Okay.

-So I'll see you back inside. -Let me know.

Hey, Dad, I think I'm gonna head inside with Soph.

Okay, buddy.
