- Hey, Ken. Are you okay? - Is he okay?

Uh, he's in the bathroom.

Hey! Hey, sir!

Jet's en route back.

And, uh, where we headed, sir?

Okay. Where are the planes? Can we go?

Should be no more than an hour.

I got us a nice room to wait in.

At least, not that nice, actually,

but it was the nicest I could source.

Where are we going, do you know?

E...Either New York or Geneva

or London or Singapore or L.A.

Okay. Thank you.

- What's he saying? - Not much.

Look, I mean, do we know what's he thinking?

Yeah, well, he's talking about his Mom a lot.

- Oh! Okay. - His mom?

What...what's the play?

I don't know.

Lot of interesting ideas flying around.

I got fired. He got fired. She got promoted.

I got re-hired. She got demoted, right? It's...

Come on!

Dad? Want me to ride with you?

You wanna suck my dick?

Is what he said to his son

as the sexual assault allegations poured in.

Hey, dude.

Let me call you back.

Hey, Ken.

If, if you're okay, will you just say, "Okay,"

so that I know you're okay?

Because otherwise I...I'll have to break the door down

and I don't really want... I don't know if I'll be able to.

Wha... But, um...

Okay. Action stations.

Let's fucking go, let's get into this.

And where are we going, Ken?

Waystar, plant a flag, fix on my lawyer, PRs,

get some independent directors shaking,

and maybe ride in to see the fucking Feds.

No comment! No comment!

- No comment! No comment! - You don't have to say that.

You don't have to say that, Greg, just don't comment.

- Excuse me. - No comment! No comment!

Stop! Stop! Stop it!

- Okay, Jess, let's go. - Uh-huh.

- This is a company vehicle. - What?

I mean, I don't have a dog in this fight.

But since you just clearly opened the company up

to investigation, lawsuits,

I imagine you're no longer working for the company?

Well, no, because I was acting in the best interests of the company.

Yeah? Violating your duty of confidentiality?

Violating your fiduciary duties as a director?

Look. I need a sealed unit here, Karolina. I need a clean jar.

So... so... are you in for this fucking revolution?

No, I know it's exciting. And, and I...I...I s...

- I... - Are you with me, yes or no?

Why did you do it like that, Ken?

- I mean, did you know? - Me? No. No.

No, I had no prior warning and I was surprised at his comments,

but now I am obviously concerned and interested to hear more.

- Okay. - This is a fork in your life, Karolina.

This is the righteous vehicle.

- It's just not... It's not... - Okay. Stop the car.

-Out. Out. Please. I need to make calls. - Ken...

I can't have weevils in the fucking flour sack, okay?

- Out. Now. - Ken?

Everything you've heard today is privileged.

Repeat anything and I'll sue you out of your fucking ass.

- Are you coming, Greg? - I...

I, uh, I...

I...I...I think I'm just gonna catch a ride with these guys.

- Right. - Okay? Thank you.

Why'd you get kicked out of the car? What happened?

Why did you leave Kendall's car?

Was he driving to the airport?

Do you have anything to say?

Logan Roy was personally and fully aware

of the crimes committed aboard Brightstar Cruises.

Kendall Roy says his father oversaw millions of dollars of payments

to hide and cover-up criminal activity at the cruise line.

Roy went on to deliver a blistering denunciation of his father and the values

- and practices at Waystar Royco. -Nice.

The media empire and parent company of the conservative news channel,

ATN, and the correspondent that...

So, what are you actually thinking?

- What am I thinking? - Yeah, what are you thinking?

What you mean? In terms of what?

Um, in terms of the fucking...the situation?

I'm thinking that we just need to back Dad right now,

and I can't believe anyone would think anything else.

Yeah. Yeah, of course. Yeah.

But... what am I actually thinking?

Hmm?

Well, I'm thinking, "Is he toast?"

Oh, fuck, you are? Really?

Yeah, well, what, what are you thinking?

I don't know.

Yeah, I am thinking that maybe I shouldn't be thinking,

"Is he toast?"

Is he okay?

I really think we should react.

By George, I think he's on to something!

Hey, Hugo's got planes.

Hi. Listen, I'm drowning in calls.

And I want to deny, you know, speculation.

So, uh, I'm just checking that obviously

we're all good if I say, for a starter,

that he never hurt anyone, and he never...

touched anyone, personally?

You can reassure on that, Hugo.

- Good. - Did you know?

Connor? Roman? Shiv?

Did you know?

Wh...What's that?

Did you know he was going to do that?

- I was wondering. - Well, obviously not, Dad.

Uh-huh.

Kendall's mentally ill. He's insane.

Where's my phone?

Don't know, Pop. We'll call you.

Uh, yeah, you got it on silent?

Okay, I think I want Lisa Arthur as my personal lawyer,

but can you call Remi to hit me up with other names?

Uh-huh.

Greg, Greg, if I get taken out on other shit,

I might need you to take my cultural temperature.

- Uh-huh. Got it. - Okay?

As in? Uh, wh... what does that, uh, mean?

Like before I get my media monitoring in place

I might need you to slide the sociopolitical thermometer

up the nation's ass and take a reading.

Okay? I'll get seasick.

Just feed me the metadata, anything that's gonna

move the market on me reputationally, yeah?

Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah. Sure.

Uh, media monitoring department over here.

Wow, everyone is telling me Lisa Arthur.

She's my girl.

Did you... did you get her avails for me, Jess?

Um, we have a call out to her...

Okay.

Jess Jordan on Kendall's phone.

- Is it him? - Hi.

- Kendall's, uh, just attending... - Just listen.

to some other matters but I can pass on your thoughts.

What...what's he saying?

- Do you wanna know? - Yeah.

Okay. I'll tell him.

Uh, he says that this could get very ugly for him.

You played a decent move.

If you were to retract

and say that you were unwell and that you misspoke,

then maybe there's a deal here.

You know what? Tell him, legally, it's not wise for me to talk to him,

but that I'm going to be in contact with the government

and that this would be a good moment for him to step down.

Okay, he heard.

...that I'm gonna grind his fucking bones

to make my bread.

Uh, he says, in that case,

he's going to grind up your bones to make his bread.

Okay?

Well, tell him,

that I'm gonna run up off the fucking beanstalk.

Okay. Logan? Yeah, he says in that case

he's going to run up off the, uh, beanstalk?

He's kind of laughing. But not, like, nice laughing.

Just tell him he should step back and cooperate.

I don't want to see him behind bars.

We may no longer be on the same side, but I don't want that.

That's bullshit.

That's fucking sanctimonious bullshit.

It was a fucking play.

It was a play, it was a fucking move.

So, don't act like a cunt to me

because it won't fucking wash!

Okay, bye.

What...what...what did he say?

Any actual legal or, or physical threats?

You know what? Don't need that in my head.

Just put it in an e-mail and send it to yourself, in case it comes up.

Okay. Action stations.

I gave him a chance. Gerri.

Everyone, let's go.

Okay. Great.

So, I suggest I call DOJ

and just right away let them know

how horrified we were to learn of these, um, allegations

and that we intend to form a special committee

and we can tell them which white shoe law firms...

I have ideas, we are considering to thoroughly investigate

and promptly report back their findings.

Right. But do we cooperate?

With the government? Yeah, I think we have to cooperate.

I mean, we were under pressure already...

Unless we don't?

Yeah, but real world?

I mean, this is a public company.

We don't know what they have or what they might get.

There's only one real play here.

And what if I don't want to pull down my panties down so fast?

Then you pull up the draw-bridge.

It's politically motivated. "Come get us, motherfuckers."

What's our story?

The story is... is that he's exploiting these poor women.

And that's very sad.

You were grooming him for the top.

But you know? He's a junkie and he blew it.

He's a bitter fuck up that needs psychiatric help.

And of course you're the big baddie,

so everybody jumped on board.

And what about these papers?

Uh, they're fake. Or stolen,

if they even exist. Are you worried about the papers?

Hmm? We'll go after him for corporate theft.

This is, you know, not nice thing to say about your son

but maybe you chop him into a million pieces and toss him in the Hudson?

You destroy Kendall, it falls apart.

What do we think?

How's the price?

Well, uh, net-net, it's steady.

But institutions are dumping in case this kills us

and arbs are buying in case Sandy and Stewy win.

Yeah, Kendall has changed the game.

Noncooperation now, it's not... it's too...

It's too hot out there. I think it's very high risk.

Yeah, well, everything's high risk if you're a pussy.

- Hey, I eat red meat. Okay? - Well...

I'm just...the repercussions.

Yeah, but I think you're looking too small.

We do a dance,

and we bide our time 'til the election.

ATN anointy-nointy the Raisin for a second term?

New Attorney General. And by then,

this has gotten a little stale,

Kendall will self-destruct because it's his favorite.

And this all fades the fuck away.

If I stop picking at scabs,

saying, "Sorry," Who knows where we'll end up.

Class actions from the chancers and opportunists.

Admissions of wrongdoing...

- Billions out of the door. - Fuck!

If you were to call the AG right now and shout at him,

- could we find out if that'd be okay? - Hugo, can you find out

what would happen if Logan called the AG?

Get the Raisin. Let's go to the top.

Let's get the President.

But gentle. Okay?

Anything else?

Do we want to order some food?

Food? Swallow. We're on saliva

and adrenaline here, until we get on a plane. All right?

No local foods.

I get the shits, we're fucked.

- Hugo! Let's go. - Okay.

We've lingered long e-fucking-nough!

Okay, guys, uh, this way please. The plane's on the tarmac.

Let's get going. I will definitely call you back.

Okay.

Uh, you're the number one trending topic,

ahead of Tater Tots.

And the Pope followed you.

Okay.

Okay, no, this is not the... is this the real?

- No, I don't think this is the Pope. - Right, great. Thanks Greg.

No, it's, it's a pope. It's not the Pope.

Frank? Hey. Listen, you don't need to speak.

I just want to say,

sorry I didn't talk to you before, but I just want to let you know

there's a place for you in the company I'm gonna run.

You just need to tell him time's up, okay?

He steps back and we can cool this down.

Someone like you steps in, a lot of respect.

You know, a lot of folks would put in a shift for you.

We steady the ship together.

Okay? I did this for you, man.

Did this for us. For the soul of the company.

This is exciting, Frank. Okay.

- Uh, Gerri. Get me Gerri. - Okay.

Oh, straight to voicemail.

The vans are here.

So, the President is basically supportive,

but they think it might be best for there

not to be a call with you on the White House log today.

Like he can't make a fucking private call?

We got offered Michelle-Anne.

Oh, the pantsuit barnacle?

I got her if you wanna.

No. Fuck it. No. I don't talk to the babysitter.

You fuckin' sound her out.

That'd be great. Yeah, Yeah I'll hold.

- Where's Karl? - Yeah. He really feels he needs a sandwich.

- A sandwich? - Yeah. I tried to tell him. But...

Guys, we have another van for you over here.

Okay? Right this way.

Michelle? Gerri Kellman. How you doing?

Listen, I just wanted to say it was all nonsense

and we know the President will be supportive,

but we just wanted to answer...

to, to offer to answer any questions he may have.

Hi, yeah,

Gerri, I think he just feels for Logan at this difficult time.

Great, well, just let him know that we are not asking for favors.

We hear you.

We just wouldn't, simply in terms of resources,

want DOJ to follow Kendall off down this rabbit hole of bitterness.

Okay.

Well, you know how much the President respects Logan.

Okay?

Great. So, off the record, um...

what's the temperature at Main Justice?

Any danger of them or Southern District going Batman on this?

Um, the Attorney General is very smart.

Oh, we all love Bhavick.

He'll... he'll see through this, right?

It's just, the DAG likes to think

she's something of a straight-shooter.

Marilyn's prickly.

So that's your only issue, Marilyn.

Well, maybe you should just fire her!

Ha, ha, ha.

- Justice can't do nothing. - Well, they could...

It's out of our hands.

Not if you grab it.

Um, but look, we don't want to fall out with him.

Well no, he's the president.

No, sure, but, do we want to get the old guys

on the blower so they can just chat for five?

This will all be great, Gerri.

Just find me whenever, on anything, okay?

Great, well, I appreciate getting a read. Um, many thanks.

Yeah. Good?

Good work. Basically supportive.

Good work, Gerri.

Okay, we're, uh, fueled and tooled.

We all set for New York City and a fuck fest?

Gerri, stay.

Excuse me. Sorry.

Oh, Shiv...

Shivy, Shivy, Shivy.

How are you doing over there?

You ready to come over? I got a spot for you.

Hello, hello?

Okay, Jess, what do we got?

Um, we have independent directors.

- Boom. - Opinion shapers, A list.

And then we've got Ewan, Laird.

- Good. - Your mom...

Greg's mom, Josh Arenson, and Marcia?

- Great. - Oh, Greg. How's, uh...

I mean...

Headline is,

the internet is big, uh, obviously...

and I haven't...I can't... I...I couldn't read it all,

but I'm working through, I guess...

Yeah. That's the big picture over here at Media Monitoring.

- Is it positive, Greg? - It's super positive.

- Super positive? - Yeah.

The negative stuff does tend to stick in the mind a little

just 'cause it's quite, uh, visceral.

But yeah. Basically, very good.

Nice memes, good memeage, and... and, uh, so on.

- Hello?  - Nae? Hey.

I got a million calls, but I wanted to say hi.

You see it?

Yeah, seems like maybe you're the best man in the world?

Yeah, fuck you.

Yeah, but I mean, maybe you are.

Okay, ha, ha, ha, sure.

- But what if I am? - No, sure.

But, um, seriously, Ken, just for a second here.

- What if you really are? - Um, Ken?

- Yeah? - We're almost there, so...

Uh, Nae, hey, I'm arriving at Waystar. Can you come see me?

Oh, um, Remi's saying that maybe they're trying to cancel your access?

- Later, Nae. Hey, I love you. - Yeah.

Okay, well...well... well, they can't.

Sure, but, uh, they maybe did?

All right. Fuck it, keep driving.

There's press at my place, yeah?

Uh, yes. So, where are we going?

Oh, God. This is crazy.

This is like...this is like O.J.

I...I mean, except if O.J. Never killed anyone.

Who said I never killed anyone?

- What character is that? - Juice is loose, baby!

Uh, Gerri. Are you okay?

Yeah, great. All good.

Just gonna go talk to Hugo.

Because now, we're gonna go, it looks like

in the first instance, to Sarajevo.

What the fuck. Sarajevo?

I think Michelle-Anne freaked him out.

Other places to consider.

Bahrain, Bosnia, Kuwait, Lebanon, Maldives,

Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the Vatican?

Okay. Fuck.

What do all these countries have in common?

They're all made up? They're lands with dragons!

No, I imagine that none of them have an extradition treaty with the U.S.

- Okay. Fuck. - You know, what I thought we could do,

um, is discreetly dangle some juicy contributor contracts

to the more responsible prosecutors?

We're going to Sarajevo.

What? To Sarajevo? Excuse me, the fuck...

It's fine. Shut up.

Hey. Look.

I'm not sure how much cover I've got.

I need to talk to a lawyer on my position.

Who's a tough bastard?

What? Like a kind of Layo Upton type motherfucker?

A woman would be great. Like a Lisa Arthur?

She did the hookers, right?

She repped the trafficked sex workers, yes.

It'd be great to have her credibility.

Yeah. There are three or four good women,

but Lisa has an excellent brain. She is a winner.

You go with Layo, people will be like,

"Oh, he's going scorched earth. Maybe he can fight this."

We get Lisa, people will be like,

"Gee, maybe this is bullshit."

Can I get her?

Well, uh, Shiv...

- Uh, yeah! I... - Right?

I mean, you know? I'm...

She's...Yeah, she's a pretty... She's a friend.

- Could you get her for me? - I don't know. I mean,

she fucking loves winning and she loves money. So, uh...

- Listen. Listen. - I don't... know.

Cooperate or not,

to keep the board sweet,

I may need to step back a little.

Okay. Oh, well then, who would...

I don't want to go back right now. Does that play?

Yeah, I mean, I just... I, I want you safe.

- That's the most important thing. - Yeah.

Okay. Okay, okay, uh,

Shiv, Roman, Gerri are gonna go back to manage New York.

No need for me to go running back

like a slapped girl, looks weak.

- Great! Another plane. - Want me to go?

No, no, no. I don't trust you.

You're gonna stay with me. Karl can monitor board liaison.

Tom here, across ATN.

I'll make the call on the lawyer.

I like... I like Layo, but, uh, I need to think about it.

Council of war on the plane!

Go on, fuck off back there, Tumbledown Dick.

Logan, uh, this plane has now been rerouted to Sarajevo.

It's ready to go. And, uh, I will get another plane.

Uh, Logan? Do you need...

- Oh, Con? - This guy? Yeah.

Con, yes, yes, yes. Very important.

Can you hold the fort here? Can you keep this all secure?

You mean hold down the Balkans with just two divisions?

I can try.

See you guys. Have a good trip.

Thanks.

Oh, listen, my guy made contact and they wanna know

if we wanna do a marketing push with the play.

- Okay. - You know?

The whole hate watch angle,

uh, you know, like, pick out all the worst reviews

like, you know, "Kill yourself if you got a ticket,"

or the one about brain poison.

Yeah, okay, I know all of them, Con. Thank you.

- That's so sweet. - Right. So, jump on the irono-cycle

and, uh, make it into a thing

for the hipsters and the dipshits.

We could make a nice little return.

Sure. Yeah, I mean. Yeah. That sounds exciting.

Yeah?

Hey, so, we'll talk about things...

- when we get back, right? - Oh, yeah, yeah.

- Yeah? Okay. Cool. - Of course. Yeah, okay. So, yeah.

You know, 'cause I love you.

Thanks. Thank you.

And, uh... Yeah, don't...

You'll see him again.

Well, yeah, obviously I'll see him again, Tom.

- Why would you say that?  - I'm being nice, Shiv.

If you're worried that he won't come home,

I think that's unlikely. Okay, so...

Well, I know that.

Okay. Great. It's fine.

- Okay. - Okay.

Oh, did Ken call you?

Ken? Me? No. No, no, no.

Not to speak. No. Why, did he call you?

- No. - No.

No. No, I was just wondering.

- Okay. Well, look after him. -Okay.

- Keep in touch. - Okay.

So, just...This is a safe place to be, yeah.

So just buzz me in.

Don't tweet from RealKendallRoy.

- I'm not... I'm not tweeting from your account. - I'm serious.

I'm not. I'm tweeting from my account.

- Okay. - Okay.

- Just chill here for a second. - Right.

Hello, hello!

- Are you okay? How are you doing? - I'm good.

- You're good? - Yeah. Yeah.

Is it okay if I bring in the guys?

Sure. Are they vetted?

- Yeah. They're legit, right, Jess? - Yeah.

- All the Emirati use the firm. - Yeah, vetted. Totally.

Oh, well, amazing.

So, is this okay to, to do a few calls?

I wouldn't ask if I had options.

Yes, yes.

- Thank you. - Of course.

- Thanks, Rava. - Yeah.

- Hey, Greg. - I'll close it up.

Yeah, good.

So, hey.

- You really did it, huh? - I fucking did it.

Yeah, well, it's been in the mail.

It has been in the mail.

You know, like you always said, it was either this

or, you know, go to Mount Athos and become a monk.

- Oh, yeah. This monastery on Mount Athos. - Mount Athos.

That, that, that could have been a more logical choice.

Surprise, surprise.

You came here for what? A, uh...

- pat on the back? - No, just,

the press. They're, they're swarming mine.

And I, I need a hiding hole for meetings.

Plus, I actually wanted to see you and the kids.

You know, I, kind of, like...

It was kind of for you guys.

Yeah, well...

Hey, hey, I...

I didn't see it but I've just...

I've been up against it at work but...

- people were saying you did great. - Oh. Yeah.

Yeah, it was... it was fine, whatever.

You might want to watch it.

- No, I... - You might want to.

You know, I'm, I'm, I'm talking to Lisa Arthur.

Oh, great. Well, yeah, she's famous.

She's the best. So, what you think?

Can I do this? Can I win?

- I don't know, Ken. - No. Right.

Right.

How you feeling?

I'm looking forward to seeing more of the Balkans.

Is this the worst?

Well, there were the tabloid suicides.

When we nearly went kablooey because of Argentina.

- I know. - The Tiananmen Accommodations?

The Black Cloud after Sally Ann?

- I remember. - I don't know.

He's the comeback kid.

No, I know, I know, I know.

But, Senate, FBI.

SEC, Class Actions.

Plus Sandy and Stewy?

I mean, this is a 12-foot sub of poisonous tree frogs.

This is the full Baskin-Robbins 31 flavors of fucker right there.

Gentlemen?

Excuse me, do you mind? Thank you.

So, this is where I'm landing.

For Waystar, three white shoe firms on retainers.

Then the next best five, let's play footsie.

See if we can tie them up with conflicts.

You two, touch base with Senate and House surrogates,

payroll commentators, and friends.

I want everyone lawyered up.

Tom, me to see editorial on anything on this across ATN

and global cable and print outlets.

We pressure-point other operations, the line is,

"Don't lean on this, it's as bendy as fuck.

Play it smart today, you won't look a cunt tomorrow."

Karl, I need to talk to the top 12 shareholders

in the next 30 minutes.

An emergency board meeting ASAP

and they'll be rolling through 'til next week, okay?

Hugo, I imagine most of that is obvious and in train, right?

Largely in hand. Largely in hand.

Great. And in terms of cooperation...

It's war!

Fuck off!

It's war. Fuck off.

- Good? - Good.

- Yeah. - But

we throw them this.

I'll step back as CEO.

- Wha... - You sure?

Well, obviously, on operational matters

I will expect to have, um, informal input.

So, as I step back, uh, temporarily,

who do we like as CEO?

I don't give a fuck.

Its name plates.

Come on. Brain dump.

Speak. Let a hundred flowers bloom!

No come-backs.

Well, I have to say, uh, I look good.

What? What? Why not? I like me.

Just the fresh face we're looking for.

Oh, fuck off, Frank.

Karl, if your hands are clean

it's only because your whorehouse also does manicures.

I mean, I imagine you're looking at a kid. Or Gerri?

But if you want...if you want someone short term...

- Frank? - who knows the place inside out, I...

You're not trusted.

- You're mashed potatoes. - Okay. I get it. Yep.

Now, I'd like a kid, obviously.

So, Shiv or Roman.

But we'd love a woman. So, Shiv or Gerri.

But I'd like experience. So, Roman...

or Gerri.

Just gonna run to the bathroom.

A woman is... a woman is good.

- Hello? - Hey, listen. They're playing

fucking dice with God next door, okay?

He is picking a new CEO in real time.

Okay. Let me just check that.

One second.

- What? Interim? - Sure, sure.

But you know, who knows how long it will last?

VW took like, 5 years, right?

- Wal-Mart took a decade. - And what's the temperature?

It's, you know, it's free form.

"Let a hundred flowers bloom."

Yeah, right! Sure!

So listen, do you want it?

Me? What?

No. You crazy, Shiv? I don't think that's even...

I don't think with the hearings and cruises...

I don't think it's...I don't, I don't...I think, no, I mean.

- No. - So, you're okay to push me?

Well, sure. That's what I wanted to know.

Because he's gonna fight, he says.

You wanna be the face of that?

Yeah, I mean, you can get too fucking clever with this

can't you?

Have a problem in there, buddy? Can't find a vein?

Hold on. Watch it, fuckhead!

Okay, I gotta go. But, if it's going, you want it?

I don't wanna be buried like Miss Haversham with a fucking bonnet

full of clever stratagems. So, yeah! Yes. Yes, I want it.

You get in there and you hustle, baby. Hustle!

Okay.

- Interesting call? - What?

No. Just...just bullshit.

Just bullshit? That's boring.

I hate boring shit, don't you?

- What? - Just, you know, boring phone calls

about bullshit. It's just so boring, right, Shiv?

It's boring?

Because Gerri just heard from Frank

and Dad is apparently live picking the new CEO.

Okay.

"Oh, okay." So, Tom didn't just mention that to you?

Yeah, now that you mention it, he, maybe he did.

Yeah, okay, maybe. Fuck you. Fuck you.

So, how come Frank called you and how come you told him?

I'm just a very straightforward person, Shiv.

Yeah? So, what'd you hear?

Well, I heard there's a number of names in contention.

All right! Care to make it interesting

Throw a little money on the table?

Well, I'm already pretty fucking interested.

So, I think I'm good.

Yeah, a full tally would be...

would be great, thank you. Yep. I can hold.

Hi

Kinda just wanna let you know, I was doing his media monitoring

for a while, but I guess

you'll be taking that over?

Yeah, that would be us.

Yeah, I wrote down a lot of tweets,

like relevant tweets that felt kind of important so I could...

- Is that useful to pass on? Or... - We can find them.

- They're on Twitter? - Yeah.

They are all on... They're all on Twitter.

- Yeah. - But thank you.

No worries. Here to help.

I'm on hold over here.

Cancelling my mom's credit card.

Okay. Nice.

Yeah, no. It's pretty stupid actually.

My grandpa cut her off.

Long story. I guaranteed her gold card

just 'cause I thought that'd be, like, a good son thing to do?

And then just she saw the press conference, and she's kind of like,

under the impression that Ken's taking the company down.

And so she's over here panic buying NutriBullets

and buying a lot of Krugerrands. Like a very particular currency.

And she never even drinks the smoothies...

So, it's like...

Berry fucking Schneider in the house!

Thanks for coming. How you doing?

- Great. Good to see you. - Yeah?

Come on in. Come on in. Let's sit, let's sit.

- Thanks for having us. - Hey, I'm Kendall.

Comfry.

- Is he harassing you? - No, he's fine.

Greg, stay here.

Welcome to my ex-wife's living room. Sit, sit.

Can we just say right off, some jobs are money jobs

some are heart jobs.

We would love to work with you. We love the narrative arc.

We love everything you did.

And I would love to work with you,

but, if it's cool, and I know you guys are the best

but is it okay if this is still a pitch?

- Of course! - Great.

- So, we have a lot of thoughts. - Yeah.

Communication planning and positioning thoughts.

How we can leverage our relationships

- with significant writers at major outlets. - Yes. Yes.

Prepare to prime and amplify some impressive secondaries.

Great, great. So, shall, shall I talk, or will you?

Well, we want to hear your thoughts of course,

but you wanna start off just hearing our five points?

Sure. Sure, you go.

- Okay. So... - But I think the headline needs to be

"Fuck the weather, we're changing the cultural climate."

- But you go. - Okay, I mean...

For context, I, I, I'm talking to the Times about an op-ed.

Draft an alternative corporate manifesto.

Drop a rapid reaction TEDx. Shit like that.

Well, that's great.

It's cheesy as fuck but, you know,

I need people to see this was part of a coherent philosophy,

not just punching an old guy in the fucking nose?

- Yeah? - Right. Right. That's in line with our thoughts. So...

Well, I just, I may as well say, on a dumb level,

I'd like my Twitter to be off the hook.

This could all get super earnest,

so I was thinking of hitting up some BoJack guys.

You know? Some, some, some of the Lampoon kids...

to just smash that shit, make my feed a little powder keg

people need to check-in with?

Like cool tweets that position you?

Yeah, that would be the...

straight-leg chino way of putting it. "Cool tweets."

- Fuck you! - Fuck you!

No, it's...I'm kidding. I know you guys are the best.

Okay, sorry. I want to work with you

if you can... if you can work with me?

Sure.

Well, we think you're going to win this and we like winners!

Hell yeah.

- Hello. - Hi, Waystar Royco?

- Gerri is clean, right? - Well, I mean. Up to a point

She was nowhere near cruises was she, when... you know?

She was in the UK on all that regulatory shit,

I think, during the time in question.

I have to say, I like Gerri.

You like Gerri?

I do.

Are you playing the reverse banjo, son?

Trying to black spot her?

Nope. No. I do.

She's very stolid. And I like Roman.

You like Roman?

- What about yourself, Tom? - Who, me? What?

You know. You're kind of family.

Kind of new blood.

Well, that's very kind. But I don't...no. I don't...

I think it's a little rich for my blood just yet. So...

- What about Shiv? - Well, Shiv's great.

I like Shiv. But no experience. And Roman, great, but...

- You don't think Roman is ready? - Do you?

Well, is anybody ready?

- Was I ready? - So...

When he's not all fucking "Meh, meh, meh"...

Plus, I'll be pulling the strings. Right?

- I like Roman. - I like Roman.

Of course I like Roman.

Sure you do! He'll fucking fire you on day one!

Oh, Romulus.

Hey, Dad. Can I just speak to you for a moment?

Sure.

Well, um, it's already getting out what you're thinking about

so, um, I just wanted to throw a couple of things

in the old, uh, lobster pot.

I think it should be me.

- Okay. - It's my time.

I can do it, I want it, and I think I can do it. So...

- But, I... Sorry, what? - Okay...

No, no. You go.

Yeah, okay.

I think it should be me.

But...

If you don't think I'm ready, okay, which...

I would understand.

But...and I'm not saying that I agree with that, but, you know...

maybe a couple of years under the wing of an older, uh... hen,

could, you know, see me crack out of the old egg.

And, um, I gotta, I gotta say,

I know that you've been sweet on Shiv,

and I love her, like a brother.

But, um, I just don't think that it's time, you know?

And all bitterness aside,

I do wonder if maybe it isn't Gerri time.

So I would think just, you know, let the stone-cold bitch do it.

She's tough, she's got the good chromosomes.

For whatever reason, it ain't Romey time, then...

maybe it's crony time.

I hope I haven't, um, I don't know, overstepped here.

Nope. Thank you, son.

Okay, well, um, I'd love it, but, you know, I understand.

But I do want it. Okay?

But, you know? No hard feelings, so...

Yeah, no, anyway, I'm just...

So, uh, uh yeah, love you, Dad.

Bye.

Roman's out.

He's out. Okay?

Who is it? Is it him?

Yeah, yeah, of course.

Thanks, Dad. Yeah. Sure, I can do that.

I can do it.

What? You can do what?

Oh, fuck. Fuck, go on.

- He wants me to go get Lisa. - You're a fucking bitch.

He told me to tell you to wait airport adjacent though,

he might need someone on investors.

You might need to fly to Boston to meet Arenson.

Or, you know, hijack a plane and fly him to Cuba.

And he didn't say anything about CEO?

Oh, yeah. No, sorry, he did. It's me.

You got me.

Oh, you really fooled me, Shiv.

Hilarious.

We've gone over that, so now, what's the solution?

Okay. Well, when is that happening?

- Eminently. - Okay, good.

Can I have the room, please?

- Hey. - Hey, Shiv.

Lisa! How are you?

- Good. - God, look at you!

- It's been so long. This place... - Sit, sit.

Wow, it's amazing.

Thank you.

So, So listen. I'm just gonna jump right in

because I don't want this to be difficult with a friend.

Um, and I hope I've not wasted your time because...

Yeah, no, the message came through.

- You can't act for my dad. - Right.

I don't think I fit, so...

Yeah.

So, cards on the table, I wanted to

talk to you about something else.

Oh. Okay.

I'm, uh...

Yeah, I'm thinking about my own position here.

And to be honest, I could do with a friend.

A discreet friend with legal training.

You know, a consigliere.

A smart, savvy woman, who can help me navigate

the position I find myself in.

Right, that's kind.

But that's not the kind of role I normally take on.

I know, I know, but,

honestly, Lis, I got nowhere to fucking turn here.

You know my husband is a player in this.

And, in one world, there's, I'm in a position to come out here as CEO.

Or I might have to leave the firm to protect my reputation.

You know, I don't know what my dad did, and I don't know what my brother did

and I don't know what the firm did.

I'm in a fucking fuck pie here, Lisa.

Can I clean it up? I don't know.

I don't know. I have a plan...

but I could easily get crushed between these two fucking men,

and I need to game things out, and I need to do that

with someone who can give me a read legally and culturally

and politically and socially, and,

you know, it's a lot. And I trust you and...

Okay, look. Okay, look. stop. Stop, Shiv.

I can't give you legal advice

and you should not give me any confidential information.

- Okay? - Okay.

Uh, fuck.

I'm sorry. Is that...Does...

Does that mean what I think it means?

- Are we done? - Yeah, you know what?

I would, I would just say...

careful who you hitch your wagon to, honey,

'cause a lot of wagons are going in the ditch.

Right. Thanks, "Honey."

You know, you'd actually consider working with that

disingenuous little fuck doll? He's not on the level, Lis.

Shiv, I am unavailable to help you.

If for some reason that changes, I'll let you know.

- Okay? - Okay.

Well, thanks, pal.

- Any vibes? - On what?

"On what?" On the whole,

"Is my dad going to jail?" Situation,

who's climbing Mount Olympus to be the new Dr. Zeus.

Look at us here. Waiting.

So fucking... hot.

If it's you, you think you're clean?

Yeah, obviously. There's a bed through here

if you wanna give it a go.

The pipeline was still sending cruise girls out west

when you were in L.A. Though, right?

Yeah, that was... mostly over.

There's deniability, Frank thinks.

We essentially didn't even actually know.

That's all on the... the little guys and Mo.

What about the satellite launch, accelerating it?

I'd lay you badly, but I'd lay you gladly.

Can I remind you, Roman, that so far as I am concerned

nothing has ever happened between us

other than of a professional nature.

Gotta be curious though, right?

Young fighter in his prime.

Technically raw, but, you know, hungry.

I am quite a successful person, Roman,

and I remain so by avoiding mess.

Well, we're stuck in this room for...

I don't even know how long. And...

no one would know.

Hey, Logan. Okay.

Great.

Okay, uh, well... Okay. Well...

Yes, yes.

Sure, I'll let him know. I'll tell him.

Thank you.

- So? - It's me.

- Are you kidding? - It's me.

- Are you kidding? - I'm not kidding.

- It's actually you? - It's me. Shiv blew it with Lisa.

Okay.

Shit a pony. So, what, you're like the boss of me now?

Well...

Congratulations, Gerri. That's, uh...

Yeah, that's great. Congratulations.

You fucking bitch.

It's just an administrative position, largely, so...

You know, I might have swung this for you, you know that?

- Well, thank you. - Yeah.

Does Shiv know?

Can I tell her? I...I think I should tell her.

I think it'd be nicer coming from me.

- Yeah? - Hey, yeah.

So, we lost Lisa? I guess you fucked it?

Your friend doesn't like you?

Oh, also Gerri got the job. He wanted me to tell you.

But I got a song for you. It goes...

♪ Your friend doesn't like you Boo-hoo, boo-hoo ♪

♪ And Dad wants to fire you woo-hoo, woo... ♪

♪ And you hung up! ♪

You know what? Change of plan.

- Hey, Rav? Rav? - Yeah.

- Hey, I got more folks incoming. - Yeah.

And, and also just, um...

as an FYI, is it cool if Naomi Pierce comes up?

- Sure, is she the Pierce... - She's the...

Yeah, you know, we have a little thing...

- Yeah, yeah. Fine. I heard. - ...going.

It's not weird? She, she's kind of good for me.

- No, sure. Yeah. - Thank you.

- Look at us, huh? Huh? - I know.

Also, I saw the razors, so...

- What? - The razors in your bathroom?

- Whose are those? - Wait...wh...

Why were you in my bathroom?

Because I don't like to drop a deuce where the staff go.

Yeah. Oh, God. Ken, uh, those don't actually mean...

- Oh, no? Male razors? - What... no!

Uh, they're less expensive.

Oh, so I'm not giving you enough money

for gender-appropriate razors now?

Ken, I'm not having this conversation right now.

I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

- This isn't that conversation. - It's funny. Good.

- Hey, Ken. - Yeah?

Uh, Lisa and Keith are here.

- Hey, Ken. - Hey, hey, Team Genius!

- Thank you for coming. - My pleasure.

Keith, Kendall. Please sit.

Uh, can I, can I get you anything?

- No, I'm good. Thank you. - You're good? You sure?

Rav, it'll just be four or five hours.

- Uh, yeah, fine. - Okay, hey. Here she is.

- Hi. - Hello.

Look what the Aegean dragged in.

Okay, I'm right in the middle... So, I want to introduce you.

This is Rava. Rava, Naomi.

- Hey. - Hi.

So good to meet you.

And thank you for this.

Oh, yeah, no. Yeah, not at all.

I just gotta...I gotta...

- Me too. Hey, Greg, can you help, uh... - Yeah?

- ...Naomi, I gotta... Yeah. - Oh, yeah.

So...

He's still in Europe. He's scared.

And it looks like my dad's gone to Sarajevo.

Okay. So, I should, um, make it clear

this is just a preliminary.

So, no confidential information.

Sure. Sure. Well, look, what can I tell you?

Uh... my dad's the devil.

He runs a crime ring, and I would love to hire you

because you're a super star

and I think you can take down my dad,

and this will be the case of the century

- and the highlight of your career. - Okay. Okay.

- Well, that might be... - I'm serious. They'll make a movie about you.

We should make a movie about you.

And how would that look?

It would look amazing, because it would be brilliant!

Okay, look, this is quite a complex situation to progress

because, as I understand it, you want to take down your dad

- without implicating yourself? - Correct.

And without damaging the company to the extent

that you lose control at your shareholder meeting?

- Correct. - And you know

that Shiv and I have had a friend relationship?

Yeah, well, that might work out anyway.

Okay, well, that's for you two, but first things.

Has the government reached out to you yet?

Or have you received a subpoena for the documents yet?

No, no. And look, to be clear,

I will do whatever you tell me to do.

I am your puppet.

Okay. Well, in the first instance, we need to make sure

you're in the clear with your friends at one, Saint Andrew's.

- Right. - So, first thing is to make sure

your head isn't on the block, okay, puppet?

Lisa, I feel like you're my lawyer!

Oh, for fuck's sake! Greg! What the fuck?

- Be right back. - Ken!

- Jess, can you... - Yep.

Ken!

- I'm so sorry. - Yeah. I'm right here.

I'm sorry, did you not see that there was dust all over the bottle?

- We okay? - Did you not think to...

- No, it's fine. - I really had no... I'm really sorry, Rava.

- It is fine. - What?

That was one my godfather gave me.

Naomi told me to open it, Ken.

And so I just...

- Well, I'm very sorry, Rava. - I'm so sorry.

- Greg, that's not... - Hi.

- Hey. - Hey, ooh, sorry.

No, no, no. Guys, drink it, enjoy it.

- I don't want any personally... - It's fine! It's good.

It's like when someone breaks something beautiful

and it reminds you that nothing lasts.

Enjoy it.

I'll get some napkins.

All these brilliant fucking women, Greg.

- I mean... - Hey, I must be doing something right.

- Right? Right? - You are.

You're doing everything right, man.

You are on top of the world.

Okay. Uh, I'll be back in a flash.

All right, baby. Lisa Arthur, you got my undivided attention.

- Where's Shiv? - I'm trying.

Looks like the Gerri CEO news might have leaked.

And I got Simon on the board lined up.

- Do you want a room? - Yes, I want a fucking room!

I'm about to eat dick for three hours straight,

so, yes, Hugo, I would like a fucking room.

Okay.

I don't need that.

Kendall.

Right.

Sure, well, whatever.

- What now? - Nothing, tell you later.

- Go on, fucking say! - It's not a big deal.

Lisa Arthur is going to represent Kendall.

Fine.

Let's get Layo.

We'll fucking beast 'em.

We'll go full fucking beast!
