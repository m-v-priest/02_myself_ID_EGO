\N\N第 3 季  第 5 集

One more.

-Okay. How's that, sir?

Like a glass fucking slipper. Okay, good. Hold on, hold on.

Let me get you...

There we go. Like that.

I think I might need a piss.

Wanna go back up? -You don't want another...

-No... let's get on with it.

I can do it.

Soph? What's going on, wild honeypie?

Hi.

Bianca won't let me feed Megathump a piece of my bagel,

so... Okay. Put... Bianca on.

What...  Hi.

Yeah.

I looked it up and rabbits aren't supposed to eat bagels.

Okay. Bianca?

Let the rabbit have some bagel.

Those rules are for fuckheads who are gonna go to Tampa

and leave a rabbit with a Big Gulp

and a dozen cinnamon raisin.

A little's not gonna hurt, yeah?

Our top story this morning is of course...

Okay, thanks. Bye, Soph.

...the fate of media giant Waystar Royco hangs

in the balance.

-Great insights, dude. -The 50th anniversary

of the media giant is proved...

Okay. Shadow Chamber.

HQ of the hashtag resistance.

What up? How are we feeling?

-Rise and grind, baby. -Hell yeah.

...between founder chairman Logan Roy...

-What's his ETA? -Your dad's en route.

...Capital banner is currently "too close to call".

The sides have spent close to $100 million

fighting a battle to win the hearts, minds, and votes

of corporate investors and small shareholders.

-Group on the table. -Positions are entrenched

so it's down to the shareholders to decide

-and we'll bring you the outcome...

-All right. -Shut up, Steve Cox. -...

and all the reaction as soon as it comes in.

Yo, yo, are you sweating me on Golden Pond?

Have we got a deal or what?

Ken, I would privately like to transmit

a certain degree of trepidation.

There he is. The Panic Meister cooking up his sweaty spaghetti.

So what... what bullshit are you selling me today, Frank?

We haven't had a breakthrough

and Logan is definitely willing to let this go to a vote.

He's not gonna fuck this, is he?

I'm just thinking, if we need it,

is there a back channel here?

It might be nice to let...Moscow know

what Washington's thinking today

so we don't all stumble into Armageddon?

Yeah. Let's... let's keep this channel open.

Eagle's Aerie out.

Will you sit out front today, Kerry?

I need to know what the temperature is among the shit-munchers.

Sure. In that case, I'm gonna leave you with these, yeah?

-Oh, yeah. No, no. -You'll remember?

-You don't want me to... -Yeah, I've got it covered.

fuck.

Where are they?

Okay. Here they come.

So? How are Sandy and Stewy?

How we looking?

How'd you fuck it up?

Total breakdown. They wanted the moon on a stick.

Two 5.00am nights.

If we lose control,

just wake me up to tell me my career's over, okay?

Oh, fuck. Was...

was there a deal there?

I don't know.

No concessions.

And I mean four board seats?

That's ridiculous!

What... It's full fat for them and...corndogs and toenails for us.

I think, at the end of the day, to settle

the clause Sandy really wants

is that Logan Roy henceforth sits on a corkscrew and spins.

-Yeah. -Hard to give that.

Okay. Well, then we're down to a vote.

-We're climbing into the vote boat.

-Great. Voting.

Let's just throw it open to the fucking retired janitors of Idaho.

Maya? Where are we?

Too close to call.

Some shareholders won't vote till they hear your father, so.

Well, those pussies aren't gonna bail once they hear God speak.

We're gonna lose the company.

We're gonna lose the fucking company today.

-Nope. -If Josh Aaronson is against

it is hard to see how you win this

with a clear margin.

Is this what we pay the proxy solicitor team for?

You know, if I were to give Greg five million

he'd say, "Ooh, it looks bad," you know?

-Hey! -The cavalry has arrived. -Here I am. I made it.

-Great. It's so essential you're here.

-Thanks. -So the news is

is tomorrow we're all gonna try to look for jobs

in the same branch of Target.

-That's funny. -Yeah.

-That's good. -Thanks.

Where's Pop? I wanna spitball.

Yeah, maybe not today, Con?

Not the best day for a chat? No time.

Oh, bummer.

I guess he'll have to make time, Madam Secretary.

Unless he wants me to go public and take a big,

black light to our semen-stained family scrapbook

maybe he ought to fit me in, yeah?

-Okay. -I'm hungry.

Hey. Here he is. The Big Beast.

Ready to kick ass with his big ass-kicking boot.

So, you heard where we're at?

Karl? Gerri?

I guess delay the vote.

Squeeze Sandy and Stewy's airtime.

Run the long versions of the speeches.

I emailed a list of assigned shareholders

for last-minute persuasion.

Good, good.

Okay, yes.

And that's it?

There's nothing else we can do?

What about the Raisin?

Well, the White House is shitting fuel rods

at the tone change.

PGN is running with Memory Gate

and they're calling for him to release tests.

And there's a lot of calls coming in, but we're sandbagging.

Good. Good. Press for something.

A statement, a rumor of a statement.

Anything before the vote that looks like a win

and turns the temperature of the DOJ down.

Great. Late in the day,  very late in the day

but potentially, all the more useful.

-Good. -Good.

Yo, yo. Come on in.

Leave your fucking lanyard at the door.

Welcome to the real annual meeting.

-What's up, man? -What's up?

Shouldn't you be on a rainbow soap box somewhere

screaming "Time's up"?

Right. Yeah. Well, without family control

I can't change things.

And that's actually what I'm about. Change.

Well, you should save that for Vanity Fair, bro. I'm all good.

Whatever. Look,

my only agenda today

right now, is find a deal that works for both of us.

Cool. Okay. Bullshit.

I'm your most powerful ally in the company.

I know

your financing's starting to wobble.

You don't wanna risk everything on the dice roll of a vote

any more than we do.

Well, we lose, we walk.

We just move to the next company.

Yeah? With a $50 million hole in your pocket?

You want something out of this. Sandy wants to hurt my dad.

So let's make this happen.

I got an inside track with my dad right now.

He's 100% ready to take this to a vote.

Fucking...

-That would be very stupid, Ken. -Stewy, I know you guys

have been angling for a better deal

and you don't think there's any risk taking this to the brink

but I know for a fact you're not gonna get one.

He's a psychopathic narcissist

he thinks he can take this to the floor

drag back the undecideds with his...

beefy Logan voodoo and win outright,

and, you know I don't know. Who's to say he can't?

So, you know, dude, just

come back to the table, make a deal, it's there.

And...

you know,

it's... at this point, it's just managing egos.

Hey, Logan?

It's Stewy Hosseini.

Shall I?

Hey, Stewy? What's up?

Okay, hold on.

They wanna meet.

They have thoughts.

Okay. Right. We're on.

They have thoughts? What kind of thoughts?

They have ideas for a deal space for a settlement.

-fucking A! -Yeah.

-Let's do it. -Okay.

Why have they suddenly decided to settle?

Well, because they know that it's the smartest move?

Or they've had bad news?

What do they know that we don't know?

Well, let's...

-let's find out, right? -No.

I'm not doing a tap dance.

Shiv, Karl, Gerri, Romulus. -Go and report back.

-I think that's smart.

But Gerri should be out front helming,

so should I go?

We nail you to the cross, Frank, all right?

Okay.

And let's

let Sandy do the soft shoe.

He's wriggling.

Let's screw them out.

-Okay. -Okay. You got it, Dad.

Sis, hey, listen.

I'm gonna throw you a bone

because I don't want you to remember your first shareholder meeting

as the one where you lost us the company.

So whatever the deal space you end up in

Sandy's gonna be too obdurate to say yes.

But stay cool

daughter Sandi's confident she can get him to settle.

Apparently, she knows how to play her dad.

Puppet master out.

Yeah. Thanks. I no longer wish to receive these calls.

Does Sandy really have syphilis?

What if he has sores all over his body?

What if his groin is all eaten away

and the top half of him just falls off.

Syphilis...

-I think we started that rumor. -I don't know.

Late-stage symptom is dementia, I believe.

Yeah, you've been doing some panicky

late-night googling there, Karl?

Hey. Thanks for coming.

Sandy.

Sandi.

My father is very excited to see you all.

So, look.

After careful consideration

if we can make a deal here

we're willing to agree to a standstill

so no takeover.

And provided we lead on deal-making options moving forward

we'll accede to a continuation of combined chairman and CEO roles

so that's... that's all yours.

I think that sounds reasonable.

And the three board seats? Including yours?

We can do that right now

I have my Dad's authorization to go there.

Can we sign off on this?

Dad?

And he wants our costs covered.

And veto right over

any Roy family member ever taking over as CEO.

Stewy?

That's what the man says.

It is a very important protection for us.

I feel like I just have to put it right out there, say it

since there's an $85 billion baby on the table here.

How do I know that he's not your meat puppet?

Oh, I just do what my dad tells me, like you guys.

Do you mind if we take a beat? Sure.

Yeah. You have tons of time. Seconds. Whole minutes.

I'm just saying they got tons of time.

What the fuck?

Well, I mean, other than the new proposal

it's a very, very attractive prospect.

I'm sorry, there's nothing to discuss.

It fucks us and it's designed to humiliate Dad.

Right. And it's basically optics.

I mean,

I'm not sure it would even stand up.

And you could probably work around, right, if it ever came to it?

With all due respect, Gerri?

Get bent.

Look, okay, sure, it's humiliating

and I'm 99% certain your dad would agree.

But given where we're at, I have to check in with him.

I'm sorry.

Is she gonna fuck us?

What?

No. I don't know.

Why the fuck you're asking me? I don't know.

Okay. -What's he... -Yeah.

We will meet your costs, but no veto.

-We need the veto.

-Is there no alternative shape here?

-We're so close.

-Come on. Sandi we... we all want this to work.

Go in again.

Okay.

I agree.

It's okay.

We're gonna go have a think. But...

we do agree it would be a shame if...

if you destroy all this hard work over a detail.

-Yeah. Right. -Right?

Let's let the lawyers get to work.

-We have a landing space here. -There you go.

-fucking beanbag. -Here you go, sir.

Oh, that's better.

You want a water?

Kerry says you need to stay hydrated.

-No. -You sure?

Hey, Pa.

Got a minute?

Tight, son.

Later.

Look, Dad.

I hear that things are shaky at the White House

but he'll win again.

Is that what you hear?

I wanted to ask you directly

for a really significant role within the firm

to burnish my reputation

-for my future.

-You were never interested.

Well, maybe I was never encouraged?

I don't do ancient history.

I don't wanna get into ancient history, either.

So...

can we...

find common ground?

I just don't think you have the track record.

Roman's a knucklehead.

Shiv's a fake.

Kenny's screwy.

-Why can't I get a shot? -Like what?

Europe. Nothing vital.

Like...

cable?

Where's the john? Yeah, so,

unfortunately, the nearest one is out of order

you'll have to go down the hall, up the stairs, and on your right.

Oh, fucking lucky I'm wearing my sneakers, huh?

Good one.

Yeah?

-Sorry about... -About what?

Trying to fuck me over to consolidate your position?

No.

It just seemed to make business sense.

Throwing me overboard to drown?

You picked your prince, Gerri,

don't fuck it up now.

You know, I think I... we did it.

So, yeah, fingers crossed.

Okay. See you soon.

Oh, you don't mind me relaying the news, do you?

No, not at all.

He's my dad, so.

Yeah.

Stewy? I'm feeling it. Feeling those good vibrations.

Let me know where your head's at. Yeah?

Let's get this done and trip the light fantastic.

Hey, yeah.

I was wondering if you were gonna be over here.

Yeah. I'm... I'm over here,

just doing my job. There he is.

McGregor.

Big day, big dog.

Yeah. So, hey, man, I just...

I just wanted to say,

you know, I'm probably

I'm sure that you're probably pretty upset

over me going to Waystar

and their Joint Defenses... -No, it's fine.

-I... I had no choice

-really, in terms of... -Yeah. I get it.

Okay.

Wow that's a huge relief. 'Cause...

I've been summoned to see my Gramps today

and I just feel like

I don't wanna be getting it -in both ends because...

-But, look. I may have to burn you.

You... sorry, what?

Yeah.

It is what it is.

I wanted to get you up here and give you fair warning

as a pal.

That okay?

What... getting burned?

Yeah, getting burned.

Is it okay?

It doesn't sound great.

Yeah. So...

here's the thing. My dad lands a deal today

that strengthens his position.

Lisa says the DOJ is noncommittal about the case

so I need to throw them red meat.

The thought is I give them you.

It's not much, but it's a morsel

plus, it likely gives them Tom, maybe Bill,

you know it builds the pressure,

and then maybe someone flips on Dad.

You see?

Dude...

It's not my preferred choice.

Or mine. I... I thought

you know, you said you'd never burn me.

-I said I'd try not to burn you. -And...

Well, no. You said...

-On the plane, you said... -Hey...

Let's not he said, she said this,

a lot of shit gets said.

Look.

I'm still not saying I will burn you.

All I'm saying is I might burn you.

It's a margin call.

And just how bad will the burning be?

I mean, even as I ask that, I can tell it's not gonna be...

You'll probably be fine.

They don't wanna send bottom feeders to prison.

They'll probably just fuck you and chuck you

to get to the red meat.

Great.

Or you drop from the Joint Defense.

Hey, Ken.

I have to monitor the meeting,

but I wanted to give you a heads up.

I like you, Greg.

I really like you.

Oh, fuck.

-It's up there. -Turn this shit up. All right.

See you.

Hey...

Hey, Gramps?

How you doing?

A little late, but we got an interesting day ahead.

Don't try to sweet talk me, kiddo.

Okay. Just a few... few words of greeting

but...

and, hey, Mr. Pugh, how are you?

I'm not an uncomplicated man, Greg, I know that.

Nevertheless, I have tried as much as I am able

to show you love and compassion.

Yeah. Oh, yeah, are you kidding?

You're the best darn gramper out

and I wanted therefore to ask you...

You asked me for help.

And I took that request seriously.

And now I hear that you've dispensed with Roger's services

presumably to throw your lot in with my brother

and his gang of crapulous shills

without even so much as a telephone call?

Right.

I was actually wondering

if I shouldn't maybe take another turn around the block

with old Mr. Pugh here

I have known Roger Pugh for 55 years.

You don't take him for a fucking ride anywhere.

-He's a friend of mine!

-I mean, I...

Okay. I... I guess the other route

is to see if there's any way that

you might see your way clear

to providing a little financial support

to help me retain my neutrality amongst... -Roger.

I'm helping your grandfather transfer

the entirety of his estate

to charitable endeavors.

What's... what?

I'm giving all my money to Greenpeace, Greg.

What... Even my part?

That was the first part.

Why? What?

Why is that the first part? I mean, how do you...

how can you tell? I mean...

-Because... because, Greg... -Why?

...your life is not a bagatelle.

Because you are putting yourself

in the service of a monstrous endeavor.

Because...

Because you need to take yourself seriously, kid.

Now, we should go in.

-Okay. So just whip through it. -Right.

Keep any dissent to a minimum.

As soon as the deal's agreed, we'll let you know...

...and then you can announce that the vote has been called off.

Oh, Ger sent her opening remarks, so we got your back, okay?

-Yeah. -Good. Go get 'em.

Hi.

I'm Frank Vernon, Vice-Chairman.

Welcome to Waystar Royco's 46th annual shareholders' meeting.

-All hail the conquering heroes! -Hey!

It's not a...

It's not a done deal yet, Con, you know.

But we're close.

I think the lawyers can finesse the rest, yeah?

Yes.

Dad, you would have fucking loved it.

Sandy is barely alive.

You could have told him to go fucking eat his own diaper

and his only response would be...

fucking...

Wait, what? You did it? We're on?

-Well... like... -Yeah.

They've got nowhere else to maneuver, so.

-Wow. -They could have said yes in Greece.

-Yeah. -Saved us all the ball-ache.

-Still. Logan, this is good news.

-Oh, yeah.

Good for them. Bad for us.

Dad, how can it be bad for us?

They were always gonna settle.

Oh, something's screwy going on.

Do we give them a taste of their own medicine?

Let everyone know

that they bent for me?

Reopen the negotiation, Dad?

No, we... we settle now or we go to the vote and lose.

Tell him he can't step foot inside the building!

Look, Logan, I know how painful this is, but we need this.

Christ, Dad, you just said

it's not far off what we originally offered.

You know, we fuck this deal,

and there are no more deals.

Okay.

Great.

Okay. Thanks, Dad. That's... it's smart.

It is.

-Well done. -Well done.

-Thanks. -Well done.

Pills.

Sorry, sir. Advil?

What do you think?

Sir?

About the deal?

It could be good.

Get Advil?

I'll get some Advil.

I would also like to invite to the stage, Richard...

fucking Frank.

It's humiliating.

All these years, he still has to play

maitre'd at the Bistro of Bullshit.

Yeah, what? I'm in the middle.

Mr. Roy, I'm sorry to bother you, but the rabbit is sick.

What do you mean?

The rabbit's sick?

What... what kind of sick?

How... Did you call a vet?

How... how much bagel did you give her?

Not that much but I just said that

they're not supposed to have any bagel...

Okay. You know, what? Just... Just figure it out, okay?

Just call our doctor.

But the doctor does people?

Yeah, if he can do people, he can do rabbits.

-Gerri? -No.

Hi, by the way.

-Is this business or friendly? -

Not now.-Oh, sorry. I was just gonna ask... -Hey, Karolina?

How are you? How's the release coming?

-Almost.

-And who's gonna announce?

-I can do it. Oh... Well. -I'll do it.

oh well

It's Sandi.

-What? -Which one?

The one who can talk.

Yeah?

Hey, Sandi?

Are you sure about that?

Well, go on.

All right, but...

Seriously?

Okay.

So they have one more proviso.

They want to take away the private jets.

The PJs? No.

Yeah. Well, duh. But no.

That's just to try and humiliate him.

Well, was it... was it real or are they just basting the turkey?

Let's just eat it, Dad,

you can tell them to fuck off later.

Yeah. We could just offer to...to cut personal use, or a mileage cap.

Bullshit. No. First, they came for the PJs and I said nothing.

Then they come for the outsized compensation payments, you know?

This is... no, this is bullshit. They'll back down.

They're not gonna blow it up over this.

Right?

Dad?

I need a piss.

Shiv? Sure, do you need some help?

Or I can con... reach out to...

You.

Let's go.

Stay.

You wanna make a decision now,

before, or...

Dad?

-Dad?

-Karl? -What?

-Frank's about to introduce you.

I... I what do I say? Boss?

What... what do...

Okay.

Well, Stewy's not picking up.

Karl, vamp!

Great. Karl vamping. You got it, man!

So without further ado

and with interesting things to tell you,

I believe please welcome our Chief Financial Officer,

Karl Muller.

Slow down, the deal may be off.

I... I'm needed elsewhere,

so...

Vamp.

Bon chance, Franco.

Excellent!

Wonderful news!

Well, in fact, we will be

hearing from our Chief Financial Officer a little later, and before that

a little further ado.

In fact, much ado.

Much ado about, something.

Logan.

Logan, we can't wait any longer.

-What do we say? -Yeah. What's it gonna be, Dad?

We need an answer.

What do you think, Logan? Yes or no?

fuck 'em.

I...

fuck 'em!

You sure, Dad? That...

Are you sure you wanna do this?

I...

You okay, Dad? Do you... do you know something, or...

I mean, that is...this is a huge call.

Are we happy?

Pills.

I just gave you some, sir. You need something else?

Tylenol?

Is he okay? I mean, does this make sense? -Is he... is he okay?

-Yeah. Yes, it makes sense he's fucking okay.

Look, he's gambling the company because he's a fucking badass.

He knows what he's doing.

Was that a... that was a... that was a clear no, right?

He definitely said fucking no, no deal.

-Did he? -That was a definite no.

Yeah. I mean, if we win

without a deal, then it's all upside.

We're really rolling the dice here?

This is classic-fucking-Dad.

I mean, if we do come through, it is one for the memoirs.

I mean, it really is quite thrilling.

It's a huge fucking gamble! -For what?

-He's trusted his gut before and it's always worked out.

Oh, God, I wish I know the thinking.

But, yeah, I mean, he has been here before, so.

He did get a call on the way to the restroom.

-You could have fucking mentioned.

-Okay. So maybe he knows something?

Well, he always knows something. It's fucking Dad.

He's six moves ahead.

Okay.

Well, so we're really fucking doing this?

fuck 'em.

Okay, fine. -fuck 'em.

I'll... -fuck 'em.

I'll make the... the "fuck 'em" call.

Siobhan. Hey, so, no.

Either you fold on the jets

or we'll take our chances on the vote?

Nope. He's not gonna fold on the jets.

So we'll go to the vote.

Seriously? Why?

I don't know.

I just do what my Dad tells me.

Greg.

Did you say... did you say "Greg"?

Get this to Frank.

Now. He's on stage, get this to Frank now.

Okey dokey.

And after a major overhaul of company policies

we continue to strive to make Cruises a safe and special place

that provides special memories for all our customers.

It adds up to a bright future all around.

Well, that's...

fuck, that's done.

Good, decisive. I mean, if it's done,

you know, if we win, that's good.

What's going on with the...

the Raisin?

I'm sorry with...-with the president?

-Can we get Ravenhead on the air?

You mean now? Ravenhead

-it's daytime programming? -Call Michelle Anne

tell her to get the SEC to shut this meeting down.

Okay, well, we'll look into that.

I need to piss.

-Where is he? -Who? Me? Again?

Yeah. Sure, okay.

All right.

You guys off to the bathroom?

All right.

What fucking business is it of yours?

Oh, no, no, I just...

just making... yeah. I think it's just this back this way still.

-It's good, I got it. -Okay, okay. He's got it.

Yes.

We'd like to take few moments now

to talk to you about our TV and movie divisions

and our mighty ambitions for content creation and...

Look, I don't know their thinking.  All right?

It's... its fucked.

Oh, great. You're supposed to be my inside fucking track.

Well... Well, where did the plane bullshit come from?

Because that's petty.

We're a complicated coalition

and Sandy's the angriest fucking vegetable.

All right. Listen, I can salvage this.

-I'm on my way to talk to them. -Good luck.

But the fucking belligerent Zucchini here

is set to close negotiations for good.

Okay, just... just hang tight, dude.

Puppet master's on it.

Logan, you okay?

Need help?

Hey, you okay, big man?

Are you okay? Did you get it... did you get it caught?

No. Give me a hand.

Okay. Yeah. Not to...

like you don't need to hold the scepter, too? No.

Okay.

Okay. Take your time.

Take your time, no rush. Yeah.

Are you okay? You're really shivering.

I think we need to get you seen by somebody.

I think...

Thanks, son.

Any time, Pop...

Papa.

Oh, dear.

Wait. It's Michelle Anne,

wants to talk to your dad   -says he's not picking up.

She's moaning about the coverage again?

She says it's urgent, I mean...

Tell her we'll call her back.

Yeah. Tell her he'd have time to talk

if we weren't busy fighting the fucking DOJ.

-Hi, Michelle Anne. -Hey.

Okay. Well, we're... we will...

Hey, Shiv.

Shiv, your dad is totally out of it.

What?

-Hey, Dad, are you okay? -No, no, don't get up, sir.

-No, no, Marcia, Marcia. -Don't get up.

Marcia. Marcia.

What?

Not now. Not now.

I have to rethink my speech

and it'll take me time.

So I need time. Thank you, Marcia.

Its OK  -fuck

Yeah its all  -What？

Okay.

Hey, everybody...

just to say that Logan is not really himself right now.

-Hey, Kerry.

Is dad on any medication?

He has UTI. Why? Is he all right?

Could his meds make him confused?

Shouldn't. That's what happens if he doesn't take them.

Okay. Does he have them? Where are they?

But... I'm not... I left them with him

but, I'm gonna... I'm gonna be right there.

I have shots and I'm calling his doctor.

Okay.

Dad's got a fucking UTI.

What? Seriously? Well, is that...

I mean, no, it's not that fucking serious, right?

What? At his age? That could make you crazy.

Reagan had one and nearly nuked Belgium.

fuck. What?

How long has he... how long has he been like this?

Was he like this when he said no?

When he risked the whole company?

No one hears about this.

Go look after him.

Tom. Tom.

Come on, go...

-What do we do? He has a UTI.

-UTI? Yeah. Somebody has to call a doctor.

Can we just give him some cranberry juice

-and ask him about the deal again?

-Just asking for Caroline.

Oh, fuck, he's piss-mad.

You know, but he was... he was in really good shape

when he offered me European cable.

When did he say that?

Because he was definitely out of it -when he said that.

-No he was cogent at that point.

-I can guarantee you he wasn't.

It sounds like he's been out of it for a while.

Okay, no, no, we don't actually know that, okay?

What about the phone call he took?

Maybe the decision he made is the right decision

and we actually don't know when he went piss-mad.

That? No, that could have been anything.

That could have been Robocall or fucking urologist?

No, no, I suspect that he's been piss-mad for quite a while.

Oh, oh, do you? The fucking Hercule Poirot of fucking piss over here.

Shiv, do you... Should you overrule him?

Go back to Sandy and Stewy and say we've changed our minds?

Yeah, I think you should totally do that.

-Dad loves that kind of thing. -Well... Look at him.

Yeah  no , cant do that

Guys, he... he says he still needs to make his speech.

-What... what do you think? -Can he do the speech?

-Can... Can he? -"Can he do the speech?"

the demented fucking piss-mad, king of England?

He could say anything,

he could tell everyone he's Barbra Streisand.

No, I think we have to... we have to drop it, right?

No. But at the very least, he should be on stage.

It would be great to get the body up there.

Okay, we push it as late as we can

and maybe if we just get him on stage that'll be enough.

Oh, yeah, sure. Maybe send him up through a trap door

surrounded by dry ice.

Where is this doctor anyway?

He's... he's concerned there is a dead cat under his chair.

Oh, great. Okay. -Is there anything under the chair?

-Greg.

-No. -Oh, okay, great, get that to Frank.

Yeah. He seems insistent and he says that

he doesn't want Rose to see it

and he wants Colin to take it out.

Fine, have Colin take it out.

-Okay. -Good. Thanks... Hugo. Thank you.

-The doctor's on his way.

Why the fuck didn't you mention this before, huh?

He didn't want anyone to know.

Okay. Well, it's worked out well, hasn't it?

Oh, fuck.

Oh, great. Hey, who invited you? Thanks.

What the fuck is going on?

-It's fine. We got it under control. -He's squashing the deal?

You have to turn this around, right now.

-We got this under control. Okay?

-Yeah. Yeah. We're figuring it out.

Thank you for your concern.

What... what's happening?

-The doctor's on the way. -What the fuck is going on?

It's fine. It's all right.

-What is that? -Will you leave, please?

That is an imaginary cat. Now could you please fuck off?

-Listen to me very carefully.

-Okay. All of you.

This is you throwing it away.

You think they're bluffing? They are not fucking bluffing

and you're putting everything I have fought and bled for

on the fucking edge and I am not gonna let that happen

-do you understand me? -Yes.

-You're not welcome here. -You fix it.

You fucking fix it.

-You may go. You are excused.

-You're not welcome. You have no right to be here.

Thank you very much for your concern.

Please. Thank you.

Go, delusional.

fucking delusional man leaving the room right now!

-And figure out a fucking doctor... or Im calling mine

-Get the fuck out of here. -Thank you so much for your concern

like you give a fuck.

You probably slipped him something, Putin. fuck!

-Dad.

-Keep Frank on stage. -Why is Frank so angry?

-Oh, that's Kendall. -Go... Is Frank... is Frank upset?

-Hey, Dad, no. -No. Some people were nasty to Frank

-and it's fine now though. -Very mad, people are yelling.

-Who... who was nasty? -No, no, you sit down

-don't worry, he's okay. -Relax, Logan.

I'm the only one who's allowed to be nasty to him

nobody else can be nasty to Frank.

Shit

And we will all work together as a team

to lead the company to a brighter future.

And now I will hand you over to Gerri Kellman our interim CEO.

You cowardly prick.

Thank you, Frank.

I'd like to begin by reflecting

on some of the many changes

I have seen in my 30 years at Waystar.

He's on fluids and hydrating

-so it should be pretty quick.

-He's definitely gonna be okay?

-But how quick?

-Well...-He's not a cup of instant noodles.

-Sure, but can we speed it up

like a blood bag or an adrenaline shot?

Jesus, fucking take it easy.

You wanna give him the fucking Tabasco suppository?

fuck you, it's what he'd want.

Yeah. But the main things is that we look after him. Okay?

Yeah. Well, obviously, I agree, Roman.

Oh, yeah? Really?

Because it sounded like you want to jumpstart our father

like he's a fucking pickup truck.

Oh, shit. Can you like call me when he's less scary?

Scary

Positive direction.

We will explore alternatives for our cruise division

including a possible divestiture.

And we'll initiate share repurchase plan

and a special dividend. -And we'll be forming...

-Doctor says he's gonna be fine -but, I don't know.

-It's fine, he's... he's asleep.  -to be spearheaded by...

...our visionary chief operating officer Roman Roy.

Hey, Lia, yeah,

I was... I was wondering just, in your view, do you...

Do you think it's possible to sue a person

a grandparent, for example

in a way which is like...

like in an affectionate way?

That might... that might convey

like "I love you and I... I'm glad you're part of my life

but I am taking legal action against you"?

-We're getting just... -This isn't...

this isn't turning any floating votes our way.

Should we call in a bomb threat?

So his moaning's getting louder.

Okay, but can he do that on stage?

Is it a wheel on and wave? fuck. Like we're not

gonna make the piss-mad bear dance with fucking cattle prods.

We need to be looking after him, okay?

So he's not gonna do his speech?

Well...-Is... is he... talking?

-Is that it though? Do we just...

does that... we go down

and get fucking give up?

-No. -No.

Maya,

talk to me.

Come on.

I strongly urge you to do whatever you can to settle.

Okay. I think we go back to Sandy and Stewy

to try and save the deal.

No, no, you can't because Dad said no deal.

-Well, dad didn't say shit, Rome. -Dad said no deal!

No, he didn't. His urethra had wrested control from his brain.

I at least talk to them, right?

-Right. -Yeah.

Because if we go to the vote, we probably...

we lose. Karl?

-Frank?

Tom? Yes? Okay.

-Yes. Yes. I say yes. Rome? You back this?

Go on. Yeah. Go fuck it up, moron.

Hey, I was wondering if we could have another chat

just the two of us before the vote closes.

Thank you for your support.

This is the power of Waystar.

A bright new beginning, but the journey remains the same.

We at Waystar Royco...

She dried out, just couldn't do it.

She hit the video but we have to close this vote.

This is it.

I've got the White House on the line. So...

Yeah, they've been coming at us from all sides

since the ATN pivot.

It's not Michelle Anne, it's the president.

He wants an urgent conversation.

On... On that phone now?

Yeah. I mean, on mute, but it's a switchboard.

He wants Logan.

Right. Well, that's not ideal.

I mean, can we... can we just say no?

Well, how do we feel about

saying no to the president right now?

Oh, I would love to say no to the president.

I mean, he can't talk to dad.

Can we just tell him to fuck off?

I mean, by all accounts he won't remember by tomorrow.

Yeah, I was wondering if it might be

about the DOJ and everything.

I mean, it's fucking late, but...

if the pressure got turned down and we can leak it

and then we throw Gerri back up on stage

-and just keep her talking? -I could do it.

I think, no.

I think maybe Shiv. Shiv. Can we get Shiv back, Frank?

Gerri, Gerri,

hey, Gerri, we need someone...

Gerri, we need someone sensible to talk

-to the president right now... -I can do it.

...on an urgent personal matter.

Roman, you've met him. right? -Well... well,  If it's between...

sorry, Roman and Gerri I would definitely...

I'll talk to him a little bitch, here

Should we hurry? Because I...-I think it's kind of urgent.

-I mean, I can do it but,

Roman, you get along with them, right?

I mean, if anyone here is bootleg Logan...

Roman.

Yeah, okay, gimme.

Just explain, it's out of respect and you can take the message.

Yeah, yeah, I got it. It's just the president, it's fine.

This guy? Tony Tourettes? Are you kidding, are you sure?

-Don't swear at him. -Oh, really?

It's not cool to tell the president to blow me?

Hey, Mr. President. This... sorry...

Yeah. No.

Crosstalk, you go.

Yeah. No, this is actually... I'm his son, Roman.

Yup. That one.

Look, he can't talk right now but...

how you doing?

Yeah. I will certainly let him know that you are upset.

Hey, I can't leave my dad alone. So what's going on?

Look,

upon further reflection

we have decided to accept your counter.

-We can eat the jets. -Okay.

-Any context? -No.

We just... we took another look and thought

that this was the clearest way forward.

And this is what your dad wants?

Yeah. It is what my dad wants.

Well... well, good, this is good.

Great. So we're good?

We're, you know, we're going to be good?

Sure.

Well, honestly, knowing where my dad is coming from

I do just wonder if there will be one more thing.

So don't turn your phone off.

Okay, come on, look.

Is there something that we can work out here?

-You know, it's now or never.

-I... I don't know.

Sandi, look I...

I don't think it's right how

your dad sidelines you in all this.

And maybe it's appropriate...

for me to have somebody likeminded on the board.

So how about...

a fourth seat...

on the board

for you?

You can tell him that you screwed it out of us

and my dad was losing his shit and it nearly killed him.

-Four seats, that's... -Yeah.

That's a lot of seats, he will like that.

-Yeah. -Yeah.

Well, it's... it is one more than three by my count

so Waystar for balance, we'll need an extra one.

For me.

I see.

Yeah, he won't love that.

Okay. Well, look, just tell him that the fucking...

the markets will never

let me or my brothers be CEO.

Oh, come on, do you believe that?

I just care if your dad believes it.

Look I should go.

See if I can sell it.

But this is... this is good with Logan?

I can sell it.

Can you sell it?

Well, I will relay that.

You are not running again and he hopes that we are happy.

-No! -We need access!

And I mean, and that's decided already?

Because, you know, I think that

whatever our... our minor difference is

we would urge you to... to not stand aside.

Yup. But, no, I will be the messenger boy, happy to be that.

I just think... yeah.

I just think that our position and speaking for my father here.

You know, good friends can be really tough

with their constructive criticisms

but we would just say, you know

and I think that you are

a really significant historical figure

who has a lot more to give.

Yeah. Well, the whole family at ATN could rally round

it would be a shame you know, sir, to lose you. So,

absolutely.

Well, in that case, Mr. President

it has been a privilege to have the opportunity. Yeah.

Best of luck to you and okay.

All right.  So...

Yeah, he just wanted to

let us know that he's not gonna run again

-he's pulling out. -fuck and fuck.

Yeah. Hey, his minor neurological issue

which, you know the media starting with us,

have blown way out of proportion

and he doesn't want to put his wife and kids and family

through all the blah, blah, blah

and fuck dad, and fuck me.

And fuck ATN and Ravenhead

and good luck getting the kind of access that he granted

with whoever is the next president.

Which if left up to him  could be a chicken.

fuck. -Yeah.

-Shit.

-Boom-shaka-laka. Hell, yeah. -fuck, yeah, Connor.

I think we just alienated our most powerful ally.

I mean, it's kind of nice to know that we can like

puppet master the whole American Republican project and all, but...

Shiv...

Shiv...

four seats.

-What? -We eat the PJ's...

We get a seat! We get a seat!

Yeah, that was pretty hard to finesse, but...

Sandy and Sandi are definitely...

-in, so...

Gerri, are we good?  Four seats.

Oh, fuck,

I would like to say yes to that.

I just... I...

I think we need to say yes to that, Gerri.

Can I just... at some point,

dad is gonna walk out of there, so...

Are we good?

I...We...

Are we good?

Four seats, no PJ's.

We're good, we're good. Yeah. No vote, hold the voting.

-Okay, we're good. -Yes.

They're good, it's a yes from this end. So...

-Okay... We're good.

-Okay. They're good if we're good. -It's done.

-Great. Great. Okay.

So, we need to check the lawyers

they need to plug in a new detail and get signatures

and then we can talk to the shareholders.

Right, well, Frank, you've done so much already.

I would... I would be happy to do it.  I see

Okay. So, we will publish a press release as... -Karl?

as Karl  -As he's announcing. Exactly.

fucking superhero!

The world's on fire.

Thank you. Thanks, honey.

Hey, you wanna get a hotel room tonight?

-Hotel? I think there's... -Yeah.

rooms in the apartment that we've never fully walked into.

I think there's just something about the way you... smell

the way your body looks at the time of the month.

You know, I'm like a dog. What time?

Time of the... I think

I'm just most horny when you're most fertile

you know, that's how it works, right?

Is this,

Tom, why you ask me when my period was?

-No! No. -Are you tracking me?

We're like a sorority house, we're in sync.

I'm just... I'm just vibing your sexy window.

Tom, are you keeping a shadow log?

Watching the phases of the moon

to see when...when I'm most breedable?

-No, I just...I... like, counted the days on my iCal.

-It's not creepy. -Oh, my God.

It's not creep... no, it's not, come on.

I've got like...

six more ovulation windows until all sex is prison sex.

I said I didn't like the timing.

Well, I think the timing is good like nine to twelve months

is kind of what I'm hoping I might serve.

I think it's a good slot.

What? Put one in for when you're out?

No, no, it's, we keep you...

-What? -...like not company, but...

I might need something, Shiv.

Okay. Otherwise what is the point of all this?

Where are we heading?

Tom, I don't wanna be your fucking incubator for...

when you're in prison

doing chin ups and reading Knausgaards.

You're making it sound horrible

and it's not horrible, it's nice.

-Oh, my gosh. -It's supposed to be nice.

fuck.

Yeah, I should be out there, you know. I'm hiding back here.

It makes me look like I'm losing

when actually I'm winning.

-Your very absence... -Plus, Stewy says

we have the deal  so it's safe.

Your very absence has a certain power.

I think my absence makes me look like a little bitch.

We believe this dynamic action plan

will restore full confidence in the Waystar brand

for both our consumers and our employees' life.

We've addressed systemic issues that affected us historically

and we vow to do better moving forward.

Because at Waystar, we've always cared about women.

Yes, may I just interrupt for just a moment.

We are very, very pleased to report

that a settlement has been reached

with Maesbury Capital and Furness Media Groups

which will...

Thank you. We're all... we're all overjoyed.

And Logan, Logan Roy, just desperately wanted to be here

to address his shareholders at this very important time.

He's a details guy, my friends

and he's been working very hard on this

and he will be, connecting with his shareholders.

-fuck me. -fuck off.

fucking stop him. Step on his balls, stop him.

Do we have a... a guy?

Do we have security?

Sorry, do you mind?

What? What are you doing?

I'll take it from here. No... Ken...

-Step aside, please. -Ken, don't do this. What...

-Karl Muller, everyone. -Ken...

We can't... we can't do anything about this.

-Where's Colin? -We can't manhandle him.

Colin is with...-Can't we?

-Colin's with Pop. He's with Logan.

You know, I'm... I'm not actually...

I'm not actually scheduled to speak today.

I would like to say this.

I'd like to ask you all

to please join with me

in a moment of silence

for all the victims of crimes that took place on our watch.

-Kira Mason.

-Oh, my God.

Cut his mic... -He's so annoying.

The narcissism of this fucking guy.

You know what, he looks crazy

and I think that can be good for us.

Iris Versppuci.

Kelly Robin...

Kelly...

Kelly Robinson-Kellis.

Did... did they cut... Yes.

-Okay. No... But I can still hear... -Oh, shit. -Yeah. Because he's loud as fuck.

We can still hear him. Cut all mics, please.

He's not even wearing a tie.

I would just like to announce that I am launching a foundation

in the name of victims who suffered sexual abuse

in the hands of my family's company.

Thank you.

We should've chopped him down.

Yeah. Well,

I guess it might've seemed suspicious.

Kind of like shredding a human document.

Four seats

and the Raisin gone.

What if we get a more aggressive DOJ?

You feeling better?

So here I was thinking about European Cable

and then boom, open sesame.

Can you believe it?

-It is hard to believe. -Yeah.

-Have a good time. -Thank you.

Yeah. So I got... I have a little bit of... of a development.

Apparently, I can't technically sue Ewan while he's still alive.

But I can sue Greenpeace.

You're going to sue Greenpeace?

I like your style, Greg.

Who do you think you're gonna go after next?

Save The Children?

Sorry, everyone.

I think...

every attendee of today's shareholder meeting can agree

we've heard more than enough out of me today.

But I just wanna say well done to all

well done to Logan, well done to Shiv

on one hell of a Hail Mary.

To us.

So, congratulations, you did it.

I need to see all the detail.

Dad, the detail is good.

The seat was the only way.

Well, that's what people on the shitty end of a deal always say.

Four seats.

But I stipulated that we need a seat of our own

and that we talked about that, right?

Adding another person to the board like me

or Connor you know, whoever.

We couldn't risk a vote.

You were... Dad, you were AWOL.

What would... what would you have done then?

Not that.

-Okay, but what would you have done?

-I'd have figured it out.

Time to think on next moves.

Don't you wanna just savor this moment for a minute

to, you know, that we came out of this alive?

There's blood in the water, the sharks are coming.

-We should hustle on acquisition.

-Just take this for a toast. Yeah.

Oh, God.

Shiv, I'm trying to talk to Gerri about something important.

Stop buzzing in my fucking ear!

Well, someone is feeling better.

Here's to us.

To us.

Hey, come here.

-I'm just... -Come on, I'm not gonna...I'm not gonna hump you.

Just give you a hug. It's just a hug.

Come on.

You okay? pop

Shiv being a bitch?

Responses, like, were kind of positive, actually.

It was good that you mentioned the foundation.

-Yeah. First the feedback. -Personalize the whole thing.

Someone called it, a sermon on the Marriott.

Ken...-Sermon on the Marriott?

-Yeah, I think that'll catch on. -That's going great.

-In a... -I'm sorry. -...good way?

Yeah. What's up? -Yeah.

You mind sticking around for a little bit?

Because I think your dad wants a word.

Yeah, what's... what's he got?

The... brass knuckles or the bullwhip?

-I have a room.

-Am I grounded, Kerry?

-I have a room. -Yeah, let's go.

Yeah.

-Hey, Ken.

-Yeah.

I just wanted to tell you that your dad

actually already left. So...Oh, he did?

Okay.

Okay, I'll call the car.

Block this number for me.

-You sure? -Permanently.
