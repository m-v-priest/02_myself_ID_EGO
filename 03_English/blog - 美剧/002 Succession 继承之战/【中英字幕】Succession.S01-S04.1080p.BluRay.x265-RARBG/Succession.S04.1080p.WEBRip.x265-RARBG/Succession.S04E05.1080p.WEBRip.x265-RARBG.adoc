\N\N第 4 季  第 5 集

Thanks, Fikret.

Hey, Ken.

Just wanted to be on hand to smooth and say welcome home.

Who are they?

Uh, additional manpower for the new role.

Okay. Welcome, " Additional manpower."

They can fuck off until I need them.

I just wanna show my face, check in with the grays,

and then get to the plane.

Yeah? I'd rather have more time other end, okay?

For sure.   -Maybe I get in early

and fucking slip a Mickey in Matsson's meatballs

Okay, we'll make sure

the plane is ready to go.

Before takeoff, might be nice to get a shot of you and Roman

on the, uh, candid shot. " Stepping up."

" CE-bros " Is kinda the bad version.

Shall we, maybe, not do the bad version?

Agreed.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you. Boy, yoUhave a knack for the theatrics.

How about one of these?

You get any sleep?

Uh, a little bit. Did you get the condolence assistants?

Yeah. Uh-huh

What do you think? Old Guard, loading us up

with human listening devices?

All right, look at you fucking chumps.

Yeah.   -This the Romey A-Team?

This is the team.

What's shaking? You camp out overnight out here?

Yeah, I got here early, I'm just getting briefed.

Should I get Shiv?

Uh, Bastian. Could you get Shiv, please?

Okay, so what's bubbling?

You know, short-range top-lines?

Studio would like to schedule a call this morning, red flag

We're okay ing Kali spit ron re shoots, panicky vibes.

Second producer signed off on leave

citing " Mental collapse slash overload."

Uh-huh. We okay it.

Yeah? We're balls deep already.

Oh, yeah, I think, gotta keep spending

I will say " No " A lot,

and shout, obviously, initially, but yeah

And you got my email

on Matsson angles, deal thoughts?

Yeah, which one? You sent several.

The last one. " Ignore previous emails

Yeah, great. Thanks for putting me through all that

We're good here, by the way, guys.

Yeah, thank you.   -You can all fuck off. Yeah.

Great. Okay.  -Don't talk to my team, Hugo

So, uh, talk on the plane?   -Yeah

Oh, here we go. March of the Emperor Penguins

Morning.   -Morning.!

Morning.   -Welcome back, huh?

Thank you.   -Congrats

Nothing to celebrate, but...   -Yeah.

So, what is this? You guys are re-interviewing

for your jobs?   -No, just a check-in pre-Norway.

Oh, okay. I think we did the check-in on the board call,

and on the follow-up call, and with your 33,000 emails

Well, just anything we can do to be helpful

In terms of, like, uh

dry-running the-negotiation or.

Uh-huh. Okay. " We trust you absolutely.

now tell us every single word you plan on saying to him."

Look, we wanna knock this out of the park

Squeeze an extra three, four dollars a share

Rome and me. Shiv on point here to advise and liaise

Oh, cool, yeah. Did I miss the invite?

Uh, what's the conf lab? Boomers versus Zoomers?

No, this is unscheduled, Shiv

Mom and Dad just stopped by

to make sure we have food in the fridge

Uh, okay, Matsson

uh, asking... he's... he's saying not to freak out.

What?   -Freak out, why?

What, is he wobbling?   -Look..

Did... Did you al I just get this? Do you have this?

They're asking for everyone.

They're requesting us all in Norway.

plus division heads, bunch of EV Ps. I forwarded

He actually sent a list of names.

Okay, so that's sinister as fuck

What is it, do we think?

Cultural compatibility check.

It's early, but it is smart.

Okay, but why check cultural compatibility

if we haven't done the deal?

I guess because we are probably doing the deal?

It's positive.

Unless he's looking for a way out

Yeah, or invite everyone so he doesn't just have to deal

with the B-roll brothers? Can I have a look at this list?

Yeah, yeah, you should all have it, I se..

You... You're on the list.   -No, you didn't send it to me

What does it look like if we say no?

We don't play that weak?

Um, I guess in the interest of doing the deal

that we all want

maybe we should, you know, play ball

Yeah. No. Great. Great. Good

Let's go get the deal

Get it.   -Let's bleed the Swede.

Sir! Sir!

Whirlwind, huh?   -Uh-huh

So, why Norway, not Sweden?   -Annual retreat.

Anyway, Norway, Sweden, what's the difference?

It's all descended from the same rapists.

Hey!   -Right.

Hello.   -Hey, how are ya?

Well, excited to get a feel for Scandinavia and.

and some hotties.   -The hotties?

The Arctic foxes.

Bit of Norwegian wood.   -Greg?

Huh?   -Show some respect.

It's not a trip to the Guggenheim, Greg.

It's musical electric chairs

To see whether they like us after the acquisition.

Find out who they like,

everyone else, welcome to the lime pit

You're on the other plane, by the way

Yeah, I know. Thanks, Hugo

But... But you're not worried, right?

Me? No.   -You're good.

With the ATN carve out, I'm not worried about Matsson.

I'm worried about being whacked

by the cast of Bugsy Malone over there.

You got a problem, Tom?   -No

You guys are seriously not concerned

about this Dad stuff? 'Cause there's been more.

Sorry, I have to focus.

Studio overages, Kali spit ron : Hibernation

225 mil sunk cost.

Estimating about three weeks of re shoots

which is like 25 mil, plus CGI

It's a fucking sleepy robot in a cave,

how is that a quarter of a bill?

I mean, it's just... You know, I'm just struck

by the number of pieces that knife Dad and.

and imply that his children, particularly his younger sons,

have been covering for him for quite some time.

Hugo.   -Yeah?

Hey, if someone's briefing anything against Dad

we'll fucking crucify them. Okay?

Rat fucker Sam, okay?   -Okay

Rome, do you want to do the Matsson dossier together

for angles, yeah?

Yay. Let's do it.

You know, I don't... I don't actually care

If you want to..

burn Dad's legacy or..

Shiv, we're trying to prep to get inside his head

to squeeze every nickel out of this fucking thing

and keeping the numbers straight across five fucking divisions

it's just...   -Shiv, we're... we're...

We're death wrestling with ogres

You're reading documents

is what you're doing, Ken.

You know, one thing.

If you want, just to mention it.

What?   -We can cut Tom's throat

Oh, well. Yeah, how's he doing?

I mean, he's doing good, he's doing fine

That's not it, we just thought, maybe

in case that might be a nice thing for you

Oh, well, thanks. So nice of you to offer that

Uh, you know what? I'm up to my fucking eyeballs

in investor conference shit

so I should speak to... Gerri or..

I happen to think we're being acquired

by a high-caliber organization

That's coming out...   -I don't know, guys

I would say there's a lot to admire.

Yeah, did you see?

Their deputy of comms is a ski jumper.

Ex-Winter Olympian.   -Yeah, I saw.

A ski jumper.

You can hardly stand up. You're fucked

I mean, Fulbright s coming out of their ass

NASDAQ master race

They're just a bunch of really impressive

very serious young people.

Did you see what happened when they acquired

the video game publisher?

Less than ten percent retention

They went through the place like fire ants.

Incredibly meritocratic.

Insular, weird, brutal motherfuckers

And we're dead

Hey, come on, guys, listen

Sure, they're young and they're fit

but they're European, they're soft.

Hammock ed in their social security safety nets.

Sick on vacation mania and free health care.

They may think they're Vikings, but we've been raised by wolves.

Exposed to a pathogen that goes by the name Logan Roy

And they have no idea what's coming to them.

Okay?

We're snakes on a plane

You guys clock that he's a movie guy?

We might need a line.

In case he queries the fucking cash incinerator

that the studio is right now

Why's this fucking belt so fucking tight?

It's like strangling me.

You nervous, Ken?

No, I mean, he's just some guy

Wow, the ice man.

I don't know, I mean, maybe a little anxious about the deal.

Sure.

You're all right, you're good. Just, you know

fucking every dollar you squeeze makes us stronger

for when we do Pierce-AT N. Yeah?

Might be a little wet out there.

but let's see how it goes. Thank you

Looking forward to meeting your Winter Olympian?

Oh, Andreas Bloc?  -Yeah

The guy blew a seven-point lead

at the Sochi Winter Games.   -Fuck

He's a possible choker, Ray. Possible choker.

Choke him out.

So...   -Uh, where should we go?

Which way to Chairman Matsson's re education camp?

Take a sea t. It's the next stop

We're about to leave. Two more bags coming

Shiv. Pretty nice, huh?

I already got fucking mud on my sneaks.

Nice.   -You like the merch?

Yeah, I'm gonna jerk off over it

while staring at you. You like that, you little bitch?

I see you.

Look out your window. Is that you?

Yeah, of course it's me. The hand some one.

Is yours small? Mine is fucking small.

When a bear shits in the woods, it uses one of these, I think.

Yeah. Let me call you back.   -Yeah, great

Um, so, divisional heads,et cetera, are offered brunch

and Matt son's invited the negotiating team,

like, " Up top " to get into it

and they'll escort us if you want.

Yep.   -Okay.

Hey, you wanna walk the deck once more?

Talk the angles, the foreseeable unforeseen s?

No, we're good

Good on the plan.   -Okay.

Well, yeah, everyone has a plan

until they get punched in the mouth

But I... but I... I might just add

I've seen guys going in,

uh, you know, uh, playing hardball.

and then not being able to row back.

So your... I tell you what, your dad, now he..

Often he would just start with a joke.

Just to establish that no matter how tough things are...

That's the whole thing, right?   -Yeah.

Bring in an offer lower than 144

net result, unhappiness. Over 144, net result, happiness.

Yes, increasing exponentially with each additional dollar

until such time as Karl creams his pants

while dropping into his golden parachute.

All right.   -Aiming for 147, hoping for 148

What-with.everything, we'd settle for 145, 146.

-Right?  -Right.

That's the-whole of the game?   -Rome?

Hey, Con. -Uh, I'm at Frank E.Campbell.

And, uh...   -Yeah, now is not a good time.

Look, are... are... are you guys okay to talk?

Because, uh, Marcia's been in

And she's talking about putting him in a kilt

like a fucking Bay City Roller.   -What?

It's, uh, Con. Uh, Marcia's been in,

and they're talking about Dad with a kilt or s.

What?   -Yeah.

Can't he just fucking figure it out?

Is it just drama? It sounds like.

It sounds like drama.   -Yeah yeah, I heard that, Ken

You know, I got a pretty full plate here.

Okay? I just had to cancel on a room full

of working-class Whites in Cleveland

So, look, I am genuinely concerned

that he will look odd and I'll be blamed.

Uh, okay. Hey, Con?

We appreciate yoUholding it down for us

but, uh, what do you need from us?

Carte blanche. If I go in the..

embalming room and start throwing my weight around

I'm going to need to make some asks

but I don't want to get blamed

Don't let them make fun of you.   -Uh, sure. Okay, Con.

Carte blanche, you're empowered

No recriminations.

If... If you want, send photos or whatever

Don't. S... Send photos?

He's not taking him to the fucking beach

Don't send photos. Okay, bye. Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye

Um, can I have a, uh, waffle, please?

Looks good.

Cinnamon buns?

Oh, yeah. Serious Scandi spread here.

Thank you so much.

Uh  -oh. What's this, guys?

Ambush. You took the bait. Fattened for the kill

Hi! Thank you.   -Good luck, everybody

Hello.   -Hey, gang

Ebba?   -Hi.

God efter mid dag. Comms and Public Affairs

Karolina.   -Yes, exactly

You look well. Very refreshed

Hi. Tom.

Oskar Gudjohnsen?  I'm Tom.  -Yeah

Oh, yeah, Tom. Tom of, uh, Siobhan

Yeah. Yeah. And, uh, AT N.

AT N. So I'm not really.

I'm not really part of this whole situation

and, uh, yeah.

And if you want... if you want a little guide of our forest

you know, the mighty oaks of Waystar and the deadwood

just, uh, give me a nod

Okay. You're the guy.   -I'm the guy.

All right, good to see you.   -Yeah.

Hey, easy, buddy. Leave some for us

Oh, would you like some? I'm... I'm happy to share

I, uh, I metabolize fast because I'm dynamic

Andreas? Hey, man.   -Hey.

Oh, wow. They... They tell me that you nearly got a bronze

at Sochi.

Another lifetime, you know.   -Yeah

Oh, man, that's... That's almost huge, man

You know? Those darn tenths of a second, huh?

Tuck!

Guy's a dick.

Hey.   -Hey, hey there he is.

Oh, wow, look at you all. Rolling deep, huh?

Rock Steady Crew.   -Yeah.

What's up? Hey.   -Oh, okay. Hi

You made it.

Yeah.   -Hey, bro

The fuck are you doing here?

Keen to get into it.   -Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm not sure... What do we do here?

Am I gonna get a lawsuit if I hug you or..

May be. Wanna find out?

Okay.

You, uh, brought the whole gang, huh?

Outmaneuvered me.

I'm solo, baby.

What, you guys scared to come and talk

without the village elders?

No.   -No

No, we don't want to out man you, bro.

I'm just kidding.   -Let's talk

But seriously, can we?   -Just us. Let's do it.

All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.   -Let's chat.

Hey, if you want.

Fuck him and his dude-bluff

Thanks for coming out.

Appreciate it.   -Yeah.

I know it's not ideal.

Yeah, well,

it's not like our dad died yesterday.

It was a couple of days ago, so.

Well, at least you didn't find him yourself.

BMW still running

That shit can be traumatic.   -Right. Sure, sure.

No sorries for Lukas?   -No, sure.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.   -It's not a competition.

Um, saw that your little, uh, kicky ball team,

they won a thing. They did a win or something?

Congrats on that.   -Oh, yeah, yeah. Thank you.

Good dossier.   -Yep.

Do you wanna know what I have on you?

Yeah

So, do you want to may be..

Uh, so, what's the, in terms of schedule.

We were thinking we could, uh..

Relax, guys. It's just me, we can talk

All right?

Okay.   -Okay?

So, what the fuck is this place? What is this place?

Like, the fucking 50 K wedding mill

for lawyers' daughters? Bridal shots by the window?

Yeah, I know, it's kind of bullshit

But it's also..

People thi... Cool? I don't give a fuck, honestly.

Can we get into it? I feel like I want to say shit

Can we get into it? Or do you want me to wait?   -Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah. Let's get into it. We, um.

We've come to say that, um, we like your offer

But we don't, as yet, think it reflects the full valuation

of the potential of what you're purchasing

Okay.

And your stock dropped 20 percent on Friday?

And regained ten Monday

Okay.

Logan was never going to be part of the company going forward

I mean, in a business sense,

his absence is not relevant.

Our key growth drivers are unaffected

by our father's passing. The dip is the dip. It's not...

Yeah, but I... I still feel like

I'm going to the checkout during a sale

and getting asked to pay more.

A bit.   -Well, Lukas, if you were willing to pay 144 last week

shareholders won't like you

looking opportunistic...   -Yeah, can I interrupt you

right the re?   -I'd rather you didn't.

but you already did, so..

I would like to propose... an offer.

I want to buy your entire operation.

For the price... of one..

single dollar.

I'm kidding.   -That's really good.

That's funny.

One single dollar. Ha ha.   -Sorry.

Sorry, man, your face was...

But I... I... I do want A TN though.

Well, no. AT N's off the table. Dad carved it out

Yeah, I... I'm not sure it makes sense.

and I want it back in.   -Uh, why?

Why?   -Why?

Uh, why?

I feel like I don't have to say why, do I?

It's the original deal.

Like it's... it... We have the shape.

This can be fast.

You can get the sugar that you came looking for

The price is what?

Oh, I don't think we're at price.

Like, 187 per share.

Fifty  -fifty cash stock..

for the whole thing.

Are you gonna tell me what you think?

Yeah, yeah, sure.

Sure.   -All right, maybe you guys haven't done this before,

but how it usually works is I say something.

and then you say something

Cause if you don't say anything, some things

tend to get a bit congealed.

Can I interrupt you? And say fuck off.

Yeah, thanks for the pro tip.   -Okay.

Yeah, we just weren't, you know,

we weren't expecting that

And, Uh, I'm not sure that that works

It works.   -Okay.

Yeah, well, we're not sure that it does work

It works.

Do... Maybe you want to check in with the boiled eggs out there?

Well,yeah, this is a material change

We need to...   -Of course, of course.

All that. Hundred percent, um..

But do you like it?

Just between us.

Oh, you like it a little bit, don't you? Right?

There's something there, huh?

You don't have to answer but.

may be an indication.

A bit of bubbles?

I think we're just gonna take a beat actually

We're just gonna... Yeah?

We'll talk later.   -Yeah

Okay?

So fucking eager.

We say? Yeah?   -Yeah, we say.

Hi. So the offer is 187

but he wants AT N

He's... He's right there.   -Okay, well

why don't you tuck your boner away, Karl?

But he wants the deal?   -Yeah. He wants the deal

And I think he knows AT N is an emotive issue

and he's being a fucking ass hole

Oh, sure, sure, sure.

But excellent news, gents, huh?

Excellent.

You effectively achieved a bump

Yeah, we did amazing. We're amazing people

So we take it to the board

Yeah, well, first, we have to run through it

and make sure it works.   -Where's Shiv?

Oh, she went back down.

Okay, well, we should talk to her too

Yeah. Let's go do that

Excellent.

You think he's just trying to fuck with us?

He actually wants AT N, or is this a move

so that we ask to subtract, and he goes low?

Who cares? What do we want?

Well, we want to keep it, right?

We do Dad's deal, keep AT N, we add PGN

And you, me, and Shiv, you know. The Three Fuck a teers. Hey

Uh, so, I just got a bad rumor in my ears.

What is it?   -Uh, apparently

AT N has an open line to Jeryd Mencken's campaign team

and they're just dialed in on editorial morning conference.

Did you know that?   -Uh, I did not know that

Rome, if this comes out, this blows any credibility

Yep.

That's not okay. Rome.   -Yeah.

Yeah, I don't know, fucking Cy d. Cyd's in operational charge.

It's a mutual back scratch.   -Rome, even Dad had a line.

Look, Shiv, we can... We should.

We should get into that, it's not okay.

but, uh..

But we do need to focus

Big picture, we should discuss

What do we think on AT N folded back in?

Uh, AT N back in?   -Yeah

Fuck, uh, well, then, yeah. Sure, fine, get rid of it

It's a toxic asset.

Uh, it's also Dad's pride and joy, he died trying to keep?

Yeah, well, let's just keep one of his old sweaters.

Less racist.

You know, there's leve'rage in not looking too thirsty

He needs to know that if there's no deal

we're good, we survive, thrive

But do we? Like, can we?

Well, Ken and I have been doing a pretty good job

In the last 24 hours?

Price has stabilized, markets seem to like us.

Yeah, the markets like that you're selling to Matsson

Well, Dad wanted to keep A TN

Uh, yeah, but he also wanted to poison Brezhnev

and... and hang Mandela.

It doesn't mean he's always right

I think that overall, he wanted the deal, so.

Well, we don't know.

We... we can't navigate by Dad maps

He's not here.   -I know he's not here.

I have a giant hole in my heart and a 24-hour migraine and

I'm just saying, I don't think we know if.

Would he have done the deal? Would he not have done the deal?

We don't... Wel don't know

You know what? Just... Let's get it done.

I don't really... I don't... Whatever.

Just get the deal done.

Okay, so we need to play this very delicately

Laid before you is a chessboard, so every move is crucial

So what have you got?

Matsson, pretty cold

Right.   -When he's fucking randos,

he does noise-cancelling headphones

Right.   -Podcasts

He just lies back, can s on, watches'em slide the bean pole

Okay. Well, I'm not sure

how I'm gonna use that to my advantage

Um, and what about in terms of the cage fighting?

Yeah um, so some say Ebba, some say Oskar

in terms of who's keeping the kill list.

Oh, so there is a kill list?

Oh,yeah, I have it on good authority

There's a kill list. Yeah.   -Right.

Like, eight, nine names. It's evolving.

Okay, I'm going in, fuck it. I need profile

But keep your eyes out, okay?

If I need a pawn sacrifice, I'm going to give you the eyes

Okay?

Uh, can I take a beer, please? Thank you.

The bankers will, uh, give the number a yellow light,

so that gives us room for maneuvers

Okay.

Hey, Greg,   -What's, uh, what's up?

What's the counter?

What?   -Just saying, yeah

in case you guys want to sling some ideas around

Just... within the safety of the Quad

The Quad?   -Yeah, the Quad Squad.

The... the Roy Patrol. The... the old team

The fucking... the... da family

Da fuck?

Yeah, maybe you could get me a coffee or something

I just... I got a feeling

Hey.   -Hey!

Mind if I perch?

Sure. No problem,   -Yeah, great.

Lukas, you remember, we... we laughed

We were at Sun Valley.

We... we were mocking Sundar's cargo shorts,

the creases, and the.

Okay. Yeah. Okay.   -Yeah. Yeah.

Well, we were just discussing, Uh, is France gonna make it?

Sorry, in terms of... As in... Like, the..

As in, like, will they make... Will France make it?

Birth rate, youth unemployment, sclerotic state, um,

fucking angry Arabs, all that.   -Right.

Will they make it, or will they pull a Greece?

Well, what I.. I think what you need to know about..

from a... well, from a US news perspective,

is that we really don't give a fuck

Uh, US is..

US is late imperial, and we don't know.

Because we don't really wanna know

You know, we have our own Paris, and when it burns,

we'll build another.

Wow, Tom.

You know, I, uh, I read a great article recently

in The Economist about it...   -Oh,excuse me? The Economist?

S'il vous plait!! Tell us more.

No, well.. yeah...   -No, no. Go on. Go on, go on.

Just in terms of education and quality of life?

Old Lady France? Fucking don't fucking bet

against the old fucking, uh... the... the baguette, uh, you know.

The... the baguette might be

mightier than the bagel.   -Can I... sorry... who...

Who are you? I don't remember you from the list.

Me?   -Yeah.

Well, therein hangs a tale

Greg Hirsch. Or y. Gregory Hirsch

He's a cousin. He's Logan's nephew.

Wait. You serious?

He's my cousin. He's good.

The re's... There's more of them.

There's...

Wait. Are you... You're... Are you all related?

This is one big, uh, insular...   -No, no.

No, no, no.

Just us.

Yeah, you agree?   -I do. I do actually

Are you done, or...

I don't know, maybe it's funnier with subtitles

Yeah. Sorry, man. Sorry.

It's fine. I've just... I've seen enough of this shit.

But, uh, yeah, you do... you do what you like.

Yeah, we're just passing time till you come up with a counter

You wanna do this here?

All right.

Thanks, Ken.   -Yeah.

Give us a minute.   -Yeah.

Oka, well

I don't wanna preempt the board, but..

my view... Our view...

it's not necessarily compelling.

We're running the numbers,

but we want to explore options for us keeping ATN

Okay

Bad   -We just wanna hear you

on price for Dad's deal. No AT N.

You don't want ATN

Okay, sure, but we kinda do.   -You don't.

I've been talking to Oskar, and we see a way back

You see a way back?

Okay. Okay. You see a way back for our..

phenomenally lucrative and influential news operation?

You gonna save that?

Yeah, it's...   -Thanks, bro.

It's... It's fine, but the graph is horrible.

Well, look. We're just.

Honestly, we're concerned.

about the fit, about your vision.

And with half our value coming in stock, 50-50 split,

we stand to lose a lot of value if you... screw it up.

So it's complicated.   -No…

It's not complicated. I've seen it. It's, uh

it's.. it's a lot of yelling. Small men, big veins

Fat wallets.   -Sure, but long-term,

I don't think news for angry, old people works

don't. I would fold it in. Fat pipe that shit.

Make it more Bloomberg grey. You know?

Simple, cheap, huge.

IKE A'd to fuck.   -Dude, I gotta say...

I think maybe you don't understand what you're buying

And may be that's why there's a disconnect here on value

Oh, sure. Lecture me, Vaulter guy.

Hey. Took a big swing

If you look at experiences,

you look at the high ceiling on parks, cruises,

IP-turbo ed-residential from a trusted brand.

Did you call it " A trusted brand?

Yeah.   -Yeah.

No, no. It's a parts shop

Good parts, yes. Bad brand

Gotta say, I just think fundamentally you're wrong

Yeah, well, I don't care what you think

You're a tribute band.

We okay?

Yeah, we're okay. We're okay.

I'm just trying to make you fucking rich

Already rich.

Okay. Well, on the offer I think

I am what I am what I am.

Okay, Popeye. We'll, uh

we'll check in, take it back to the board

Right? Hate to see this break down.

Yeah, let's make it work. Let's make it work.

Okay.   -All right, it's time!

Time for sauna. Sauna! Sauna!

Come on. Sauna! Sauna! Sauna!

Oh, my God.

Poor bastards

Hanging in the window like Peking duck.

Hey.   -Hey.

Sorry about the shit weather here

You should've been here last week

Oh, yeah. Well, everything was better last week

So, Siobhan, this is Ebba, our head of comms.

Hey.   -Hi.

Ebba is like an estrogen air freshener

we keep around to try to keep us

uh... smelling clean.

It's okay, I keep notes

When I walk, it either goes in my book, or they pay me off.

You'll never walk. You fucking love it

Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. I love it.

So, uh... how bad was..

this thing?

This?   -Yeah.

The majestic stags sparring with their memory foam hard-ons?

It was a breathtaking spectacle.

Listen...

I like to fuck around.

I do. But... but I like to fuck around like..

psilocybin at breakfast, you know?

Uh-huh.   -When it comes to money, just.

say the fucking number.   -Uh-huh

Sure. So, what am I? The... the messenger girl?

Is it there?

Fucking deal?

Yeah, potentially

It's potentially there.

What do you think?

Hmm?   -How does it feel?

Oh, yeah. I don't know. Not great, but...

also, I guess that's the thing, right?

We're selling. It's like..

have we won or lost? It's kinda hard to tell

Because...

I think I'd like to tank the deal

Keep ATN?

I think tank the whole deal

Like, kill it. Blow it up

Well, that's quite the high-risk

piece of fucking sword swallowing

I like running the ship. I think we're good at it.

And I don't want to stop. I mean, do you?

Well, everyone wants the deal. It's Dad's deal

He's a bad fit.

Yeah.   -You know it. He's a bad fit

He doesn't get the company and I think he's gonna fuck it

We've seen him up close and he's a card trick

and he's gonna destroy everything Dad built

You want to, uh.. Wanna chew it with Shiv y?

Yeah.

I just think...   -What?

Can Pinky dance?

I mean, no. Obviously not. But...

You like it though

Go from fucking weekend warriors to bossing full-time?

It's Dad's deal.

It just... It feels.

fucking do the deal. Finish his breakfast, you know?

I don't know. What do you think he would do?

What do I think he would do?   -Yeah

Exactly whatever the fuck he wanted, right?

Well, that's right

Well, we have to make him walk, right?

So that he thinks it's his call?

Yeah.

I mean, if the Old Guard smells that we're getting smart

they're gonna shit their beans, go crying to the board

and we're fucking toast.   -Yeah. Sure.

It's a fucking tightrope walk on a straight razor

Five-hundred-foot reputational drop

Okay, but why is that making you smile?

That shouldn't make you smile

Who likes tightrope walking a straight razor?

Nut bag.   -I just think it's fucking feel the force time

Choose our adventure.

Full bore. Fuck the living shit out of this thing

You with me?

Yeah, let's do it.

Let's tank it. Let's fucking do it

All right.

I've... I can find it hard to see the angles on people

you know.

Like, I... I... I get into things, and then..

I don't have... I don't have very good boundaries

Like..

I'm doing it now.

Okay, so I think...

a meaningful bump gets you over the line

All right. So you're saying..

if I keep offering more and more money..

eventually, I'll get it.

Thanks, top mind

You got it.

What do you think of Ebba?

Yeah. I don't know

Ebba is not good

She's very...

Like she won't let me in.

What's your Karolina like?   -She's good

She's solid.

Here.  -Sure

Well, I...

I might be in a bit of a pickle.

Yeah?   -I  Yeah. People are judging me.

Yeah?   -Yeah.

Lots of judging.

So, what's going on with your husband situation thing?

Well, we're fucked

It's a disaster

I broke his heart and.

he broke mine..

and we lost our footing

I don't know.

Hey, I'm not gonna...

give you the whole backstory and everything, but

I was... I was seeing this girl

and after we broke up..

because of some things that we said

when things were nice and intense, you know

as sort of a nasty, friendly joke about.

about what I shouldn't do

I sent her some of my blood

Okay.

A half-a-liter frozen blood brick

As a joke, obviously.   -Half a liter?

Yeah.

And then... Well, I mean, obviously

first of all, good one.   -Yeah.

Well, she got a bit weirded when I did that, but I,

I just kept doing it. Again, and again, and again.

And then, it... it became not a joke..

and then a joke again.

And... and now, it's... apparently not a joke.

This is...

Well, who is this?

It's Ebba.

Actually, it's...

Yeah. It's a bit... It... it's a bit, uh.

A com... complex situation

But what... I'll... I'l I just..

deny it, right?

I'll call bullshit and just lawyer it out

Well, Deniability is difficult

given she has so much of your blood

Man, your head of comms?

I don't know who you got advising you on this

but whatever they're telling you

you gotta 10x it.

Cause people, you know, people don't know you,

and if this acquisition goes through

US media are gonna be all over you.

So if you're the creepy stalker guy

who sits in the dark writing code

dripping into an IV bag.

and harassing his direct reports, it's

it's gonna have an economic impact

It's bad.

Well, three-point PR plan just off the top of my head

Point one

Might be hard for you, but..

stop sending people your blood

and then, you know, like catch and kill may be?

Or just have like a really open meeting

Do not... Don't fire her.

No?   -Yeah, you know,

Gerri would be good on this. And I can..

I can give you in... some informal advice

if you like.   -I would like that.

I would.

I like you.

You're cool.

You're not judg y, and you... you.

Thanks

You can take a joke.

I like that.

Like your dad.

Yeah.

Hey, Kenny.   -Greg, hey

Listen, I need some help

Well, yeah, sure.   -Okay

What do you got? What do you got for me?

I have a contact.

They're gonna be calling you on this line

Any additional context? Or...   -Yeah, no

You're just telling a journalist the truth.

which is that nobody's getting along

the two cultures don't mesh, and the deal vibes are bad

Okay. Sour the vibes to give us juice in the room.

Yeah, something like that.   -Am I right?

Yeah.   -Quad Squad. That.

It's Quad Squad type shit.   -Yeah

You can do that?   -Yeah.

Okay.   -Oh, yeah

Jess, I need you to

liaise with their AV guy.   -Yeah. Okay, yeah.

Set up a screening

Hibernation, rough cut

Uh, 4 K, fucking giant screen, full three hours

Uh, for when? For...   -Tomorrow morning

Sure. Yeah.

It's waking up!

You a woke me from my hibernation.

Killing off Go Jo members one  -by one like Kali spit ron.

Or Zana plax.

In 4 DX, they move, they shoot water at you

Hey, you seen this?

Nasty little piece about out here?

You know, no one getting along, bad vibes.

You know where this is coming from?

Shiv...

Them. I'm sure.

They re probably trying to put the squeeze on you.

Hear you were getting pretty close with Lukas last night?

Yeah, you jealous? Just, you know,

working the case, looking for angles.

Right. You get anything we can use?

Where you going? Yeah, I'm gonna go back

It's so intriguing

I mean, honestly, no. I think he wants A TN for real,

and he's gonna go high to get it

So, what's the plan?

Up on the ridge. Crunch time.   -Okay, pitch is,

we retain ATN and we'll bite at 146

Or he takes A TN, but we need a crazy premium.

Goo'd? ?   -Yeah

Very good.   -Good.

Good.   -Yeah.

Good. Great.   -Yeah, let's go

Let's take it to the ridge

Rock it.

Rock it, fellas...   -Shut... Shut up.

Oh, what are yoUhearing? I hear that, uh,

Jimenez think s he's gonna be tap dancing

across Lake Michigan.   -You know,

you should be careful, Tom.   -Why?

These people are coming down from molly, and their pupils?

They're dilated

And your shoes are like looking at the sun.

No, they're dangerous

What are you doing? What are you doing?

What are you doing?   -I'm helping you, Tom.

This is why people don't take you seriously

'cause your shoes are so fucking white

Your earlobes are thick and chewy.

What the fuck?   -Yeah, like barnacle meat

How was your little chat with Lukas

It was good.   -Yeah.

I mean, he's boring, but he's very conventionally attractive.

He's broad. I used to think you were broad.

but you're, you know, compared to him, you're wiry.

You're like a fucking spe lunker.

Jesus fucking Christ. Goddamn it.

What?   -That's some fucking

Connor... Dad, it's... But it's not Dad... It's..

Fucking sent a picture. Jesus Christ.

Oh, I'm sorry.   -Yeah.

Do you wanna see it?

No, I don't.   -Yeah

I don't... Is it...

is it okay?

No. I mean, yeah, it's fine. It's fine, it's not.

It's just...Fuck!

Sending out cool tweet s?

People are fucking tiny, right?

But not us. Not us.

So, thanks for the link. I saw the movie.

Yeah, no worries. You know, it's, uh

early cut, still some work, but..

Yeah?   -we're excited

It's the big one.   -Oh, yeah?

Yeah. I mean, it needs to be, strategically

You know, few issues, but

but exciting.   -Yeah. But you know.

Everything is fine " Is the headline, so...

I feel like there's a " But " In here somewhere.

Yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean, the first two hours of the movie

is a sleeping robot, but we can fix it.

We got control of the cut. But the lowdown is.

is that it's spiraling and tomorrow, or...

soon, there's gonna be a press thing

about it being " In crisis " Or whatever, something like that

You know, Hollywood's always in fucking crisis, right?

Yeah, right. Right

But it's a big one, huh?

Yeah, fucking LA studio's out of control

It's cultural issues, but, you know, it's cool.

The fix is easy. We only.

We only flag it so you know we're not hiding.

All right. I appreciate that. Thanks

Hey, guys.

Are... are you for real?

What?   -The movie.

And what about these fucking press stories?

Are you Scooby-Dooing me here?

Is that where you went?

Hanna-Barbera fucking business school?

.. You're telling me the theme parks are haunted

and your big movie is shitty?

Are you tanking the deal?

No man. No.  -No.

We're just being open.

Cook on our models and the bank s models

Yeah, yeah.   -I think there needs to be more value

for the board to get conviction on this

Right. The banks. Yeah, yeah, yeah

The banks, of course.

Also the pace.

You know, we... we... we might need to slow it down

a little. It's a behemoth

Slow it down a bit.

And we got the election coming up.

and then there'll be the transition,

and we have relationships, so, you know,

in terms of regulatory issues.

Yeah, I preferred doing this with your dad

I mean, he was a prick, but at least he knew what he wanted.

Okay. Pedant's corner.

Our dad was not a prick, okay?

All right, sure. But he was.

There are just some issues, is the honest truth

Fucking streamers, studio news, it's a lot.   -Yeah.

Yeah, I need to make this happen fast

Okay?   -Totally. Totally.

We're committed, but, you know, this is a...

It's a long-distance run. It's not a sprint.

I think he'd be embarrassed if he saw you two now.

His two big boys playing Scooby-Doos

Am I gonna have to go around you?

Talk directly to the board?

Talk to the old ones?

Unbelievable

Rome...

Yeah

Hey, I was just thinking. Do you remember

when you asked me when my dad was gonna die?

Yeah, that was a joke, Roman.

You really couldn't push this a week, could you?

You just couldn't like.

There was no part of you that could just be like.

" Hey, let's reschedule and move this'cause, you know,

their dad just died and, you know."

I mean, my sister's kinda... She's fucked up about it,

and my brother's a mess, and I'm fucking... I'm gone.

I'm like I'm on the fucking... I'm dead. It's over for me.

It's okay, it's fine.

But you just drag us out here,

you in human fucking dog man. You...

Crazy.   -Easy, brother.

You fucking killed him too. You're the one who did it

You just... And you did. You drained the life out of him.

You dragged this thing out for six fucking months

and then you bring us out here now

You couldn't wait like a few days.

You actually couldn't do that for us. No idea, huh?

God!

This is good, Rome.   -Yeah, shut the fuck up, man.

We're not selling to you. Okay? We're not doing that

We are gonna grind you down, man

We are sand in the gears

Every e-mail is gonna take like six months

We're all gonna spend hundreds of millions of dollars,

and in the end, you're gonna get fucking bored and move on.

It's not happening, okay?

Really?   -Yeah.

Yeah, I fucking hate you.

And if you tell the board I said any of this,

I'm just gonna say it was a negotiating tactic,

and you know what? Maybe it is.

But it's not. So fuck you.   -Oh, wait, wait, wait.

You just fucked yourself.   -Did I?

Good.   -Really?

Yeah.   -Good.

Did yoUhear what your little brother said here?

Did yoUhear what I said?

Did yoUhear it? Yeah.   -Was that clear?

You know, it's uh,

it's a negotiating tactic, you stupid cunt.

All right. Okay.   -It is.

You piece of shit!

Did... YoUheard that, right?

It wasn't the plan, but maybe it plays.

You know, if a deal collapses in the woods

and no one hears it, is it an SEC violation?

All right, I feel like he looks solemn.

May be danger, may be no deal?   -No, no. Ken's unreadable.

It's Roman you wanna eyeball

I think they got it over the line.

You?

You.

How are you?

Thanks for ca...

Hey, it's Mattson.

Mattson.   -Mattson.

Yeah. Oh, oh.   -Yeah?

Uh, okay

Well, uh, thank you

Uh, do... I would be glad to pass that message along

Would you like to speak to one of them yourself?

They're both

Nope.

Revised offer.

One-ninety-two

Five-dollar bump, okay

Wow, he really wanted AT N

Hey, it's a home run, boys

Hail the conquering heroes

Your dad would be really proud

One-ninety-two?   -You're welcome

Amazing.   -Yeah, very good

Excellent.   -Yeah.

Let's run the numbers and take it to the board

Right.   - Shall we?

Good, good. Yeah, terrific.   -Okay.

One-ninety-two. It's undeniable.

One-ninety-two

We came, we saw, we pillaged

We raided the Vikings.

Yes!   -Are you kidding me?

One-ninety-two.   -Great job, guys.

Thanks.   -Thanks, Jess.

Hey.

So there's, uh, apparently a deal

Deal?   -Yeah, Matsson takes ATN

the whole caboodle

Okay.

Oh, come on, Tom, you can be happy.

It's, you know, it's The Great Escape

Well, we'll see

We'll see. Yeah.

Yeah, we're looking at some moves at ATN

I'm not happy, so

Okay.

You're really gonna do this?   -Yeah

Cyd's getting too close to Mencken.

Yeah, she's really just..

She's just a little bit power-crazed post-Dad

so she's gotta go.

You think?

Yeah, you wanna let her know?

Sure. Uh, sure. Yeah.

Don't get an erection, Tom. It's weird

You wanna get dinner when we get back?

Well, I don't know

Hang on. Important call.

Hey.   -Are you with your brothers?

Could you send me a photo of their faces?

Yeah, sure

Congrats, congrats, congrats

What... what... what's going on there?

I don't know. It's...   -What is that?

Is that... Is that the kill list?

It is, isn't it?   -Wait.

It's just, uh, Jess managed

to get a hold of something.   -Yeah, yes, it is.

Um, uh, early draft

GoJo finance list of potential severance costs

It's highly provisional

It's... it's caveat ed, subject to change

It would just be an interpretation.

Come on, Gerri. Don't leave us hanging

Who's on it?

Okay, if you insist.

In seemingly no particular order

um, just, uh, potentially surplus

to requirements are.

Ray.   -God fucking damn it

Mark.   -Shit..

Hugo.   -That slalom motherfucker!

Frank.

Naturally. It's just speculation

Karl.

Let the good times roll

Wait, wait. What about Karolina?

Okay.

She's not on the list, so retained.

Retained. Okay.   -And you?

Congratulations.   -Thank you.

Uh, also not on the list.

Tom? What about Tom? Tom must be on the list

Oh, my God.

I don't see him.   -Great fucking trip

Highly fucking productive

So much for being raised by wolves.

Congratulations, you guys.

Nothing to it. Right?

One-ninety-two.   -We did it
