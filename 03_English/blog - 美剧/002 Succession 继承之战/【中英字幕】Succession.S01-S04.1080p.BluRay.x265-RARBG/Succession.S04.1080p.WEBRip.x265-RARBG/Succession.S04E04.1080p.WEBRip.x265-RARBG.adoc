\N\N第 4 季  第 4 集

Hi. Hello.

Good morning, Siobhan.

Sorry to bother you today

Uh, hey. Sharon. Uh, hi. No problem.

I wanted to discuss your results and I didn't know,

but I thought you would want the chance to be aware,

if you're up to it.

Yeah, sure. Okay.

I won't draw it out. It's a good result

The journey we went on with the amniocentesis

after what the blood test showed us…

everything looks healthy

Okay. Good

Great. And you're still well? No spotting, no bleeding?

No. No.

Okay.

Well, in terms of all the results I have for you

there is nothing I think we should be concerned about.

Okay.

Great.   -So, Davina will reach out

to make an appointment for your 20-week scan.

But I'm thinking of you at this time

And if there's anything I can do.

Okay. Great. Thank you. Thanks, Sharon.

You know, you fucked me

You fucked me right in the ass here.

What you've done, Juliet, is you've taken a strap-on

and you fucked me right in the ass, yeah?

Call me. Please.

Have a seat.   -Thank you

I will see you later.   -Okay.

Yeah. Thanks.

Hello, Marcia.   -Hi, Kendall. Hi

Mes condoleances

Sorry for your loss

Thank you. Uh, likewise.   -Yes

It's a terrible shock.

Right.

And, uh, where... where have you...

When did you get in?

We spoke every morning and afternoon,

so I came as soon as I heard.   -Okay

Yeah, I mean, uh...

I honestly... I didn't think you guys were...

You know?   -We were very close.

It was complicated

but we spoke intimately every evening

Right. Okay

Graham, Janet.   -We're so sorry

Thank you so, so much

for your sending of flowers

Praying for you, Ken.   -Oh, thankyou

It's so nice to see you, dear one

Hey, brother.   -Sorry, Ken.

Thank you. Thanks, Cyd

Sorry for your loss

So sorry, Kendall.   -Thank you, Penny. Thanks.

Thanks, Mark.

Hey.   -Hey.

How you doing?

Hey.   -Hey.

What's up with Marcia?

Oh, the belle of the ball?   -Death becomes her.

And, like, where... where's... You know, where's Kerry?

In Marcia's trunk

Inside an anaconda. Inside a sarcophagus

You know that Marcia hasn't seen Dad

in, like, seven weeks. Says on his calendar.

Intimate calls every night

Did you get that one?   -No.

I think I might sue her

for making me think of Dad doing phone sex

No?

Yeah. No. I could do a phone sex bit if you want

I just thought you wouldn't be in the mood

Yeah, I'm actually... I'm fine

Like, I'm sure it'll crush me, eventually

Freight train a -coming! But today I'm... Yeah, I'm okay.

Yeah?   -Yeah.

I feel knocked out.

Yeah.   -I didn't sleep.

I wonder if maybe I've just thought about it so much

one way or another that I don't know

I've maybe pre  -grieved.   -Well, good for you. I mean,

I don't believe you, but...

No. Well

Either way, we should, you know, huddle

'cause...   -Yeah, yeah

for some of us, it's a sad day. But for others

it's Coronation Demolition Derby

What's the schedule?

Work call is 11:00, I think.

Hey. How we doing?

It's so strange being here.

Yeah.   -... without him.

Indeed. Indeed. So, what have I missed?

A lot of incoming

Lot of incoming.   -Yes.

Presidents. Prime ministers.

Yep. Just trying to keep everything stable.

Board on the line in, what, an hour, to pick a new top dog

And what's your sense, Frank? What are the, uh, CEO vibes?

Would anyone care for...

a look at the china?

He was gonna fire half that room.

Do people know that? Should we get that out there?

No. We don't want it to look like a shit show

You know, it's chaos narratives...

fratricide narratives, bad narratives

Hey. Hey. guys.   -Hi.

Oh, man.

I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry for your loss.

Thanks, man.   -Thank you

It's just great that we can all...

The family can support each other and stay strong through this

Yeah.   -Thanks, Greg

My guys.

My lovely guys.

Okay. Hey, hey. You know, we're not, like,

playing Chutes and Ladders. Okay? Our dad just died.

-And...   -No, I'm sorry

I'm sad.

And just thinking about how things will shake down

Right? There's the board meeting coming up...

any minute, and I talked to Ewan and he'll have a say

So...   -You... You need to get

a new mommy. Okay?

We're not your mommy.

I'm... I'm getting a call here. Could you maybe...

Thanks, Greg.   -Yeah. No, I mean it. Seriously.

Fuck right on off. Thank you.  -Sorry, guys.

Matsson. Do I?

Yeah.

Let's just... Let's... Let's...

just do five...   -Yeah

And get our ducks in a row. Yeah? I mean, we...

We fucking blurt and he puts it on his socials

and suddenly we sold Manhattan for glass beads

Right?   -Okay. I'll let it ring out

So, the aim is, we'd like to make an announcement today

Stating who we think would take over in the interim

ready for Monday.   -Right. And here's my position

I wonder if we don't wanna take control of the plane here.

Yeah, well. The... I guess the first thing is the GoJo deal.

The board, the shareholders, everyone's very keen.

So...   -No, exactly. And I tell you,

I worry about the kids' commitment to the deal

If we called around the board, Frank

you would hold a lot of sway on the interim appointment

They'd like senior management input, yeah

Right, and if the message we gave was to be, you know,

"But that the kids are... are...

Screw ups and dipshits.

Maybe, uh, not constitutionally

well  -equipped at this point...

to take on the role    -Yeah.

I guess the question then, uh, would just be

"Who might we favor?'

Gerri, obviously, is a safe pair of hands

She's done it recently.   -Yeah.

Although, obviously, generally speaking.

the CFO might be considered the natural interim

Yeah.

I guess you've already had your tilt at the windmill on here.

Exactly. I've already done it. And quite successfully

And it's an interim role...

to do the deal. I'd get it done

Buckle you into your golden parachute, Karl.

Well...

Don't push me out the plane so fast there, Gerr.

Well, with the old man gone.

I can't help but wonder if I don't have a little left to give.

Look. I think you're a corporate legend

What you did in the '90s with cable?

Huge.   -Logan was souring on you.

Well, Logan's not around anymore

I would just like to say...   -Yeah

...to this senior group of very respected greybeards

that all I have ever personally asked

is the chance to serve.

I mean, I'm sick with grief.

You're sick with grief?   -  -But I...

Well, you might wanna put down that fish taco

You're getting your melancholy everywhere.

Very funny, but...

were the opportunity to arise,

all I would say is that if there's a ring

my hat's in, respectfully.

Well, I would just say, um,

if we were to recommend you to the board...

the question they might ask

would... Can... can... Can I frame the question for you?

But as a friend.   -Sure.

Just so... so you'd be...  Sure.

... be prepared. The negative case would go.

you're a clumsy interloper and no one trusts you.

The only guy pulling for you is dead

And now, you're just married to the ex-boss' daughter

And she doesn't even like you

And you are fair and squarely fucked.

Jesus, Karl.

Frank.

Can I grab you for a second?   -Oh, sure. Yeah

Hi. This is, uh, Oskar

on Lukas's phone.

Oh, hey, Oskar. Uh, this is Roman Roy.

Lukas called but I was just rounding up

my chimpanzee friends 'cause they wanna say hi too.

Is he there?

Oh, uh. No. He, uh... He won't now, he says

Yeah, okay. All right

Um, so can you get him, please?

Yeah, well. He was... he was calling last chance,

unfortunately, because, y'know, we... we have this, uh,

a company strategy sesh this week

Hey, this is Kendall. Come on, man.

We dropped a call because we wanted to all beon

out of respect. Can you grab him?

It wasn't a power play

Oh, sure, man. No, that's cool. No, we know.

It's, uh... This isn't from him.

He's just on a super tight schedule now

Okay. Well, does he just not wanna say hi?

You know, is he still buying the company?

Oh, sure, man.

Maybe, if you don't squeeze too tight. No, no.

He's, uh... He's excited to speak to you guys

Who will be leading?

We're just huddling on that now.

We're a pretty fluid group.   -Yeah.

But listen, it seems like maybe

your retreat has come at a good time.

Yeah?

You guys get your ducks in a row.

We do our board, pick our captain.

We can reconfigure in a week or whatever

Yeah. Well, we d... we don't... we don't wanna lose momentum.

Uh  -huh. Okay. No, nor us

Y... you obviously know what happened here

yesterday, right?

Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah. We really feel for you guys

Bad one.

Yeah, yeah. Yeah, bad one. Thank you for that. Thanks

Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, could you guys

or whoever, one of the old guys you have,

like, be here in 24 hours to do this?

Y... Sorry, our... our dad just died

and we have the election coming up.

How would you feel about doing a meet in the U.S.?

To have here... This... This is the annual retreat.

We can't just drop it

No. I totally see that. Fine.

Marcia.   -Yeah.

I am so sorry for your loss

Thankyou. See how they run.

Yes. Scurrying like little rats.

Hi, Marcia.

Hi.   -I'm so sorry for your loss.

Thank you.

To you too, Connor.

Okay. Hi.

Thank you.   -Marcia, we'll catch up later

Yeah, of course.   -Okay

Okay.

Congratulations.   -Thank you

Look how far you've come.   -Yup

Well, look at us both. Right?

I'm sorry about everything. I mean,

after your wedding, to have to do this

Uh, we're gonna head off next week

You know, we've got a little trip planned out.

Wisconsin, Minnesota,

Michigan, Pennsylvania

Mm, the honeymoon states

Yeah, sorry

I'm just gonna...   -Right

I wanted to say, because.

these things could happen in a flash

But if and when the time comes

for you to consider selling this place

I would be...

I'm worried to even say the words

But I... I would be... I...   -No need to be ashamed

We're family.

I will be looking for between 60 and 70 million.

Oh, right. Okay.

Yeah.   -So, like...

Sixty three or...  -Done.

Done?   -Yeah. Done.

Okay.

Yeah.

Done.  Great.

Karl, hey.

Come here a second. I wanna talk to you about something

In my role as executor, I've, uh, had passed to me

a rather worrying piece of paper

Okay. And...

Who else knows?

As of now, as far as I know, just you and me.

So what are you thinking?

Well, I honestly didn't even wanna start thinking

till you were here.

I mean, could it, might it just go away?

I mean, it might get lost

I hope it doesn't.

But what if your hand goes a little wobbly

and the draft takes it away

and it gets flushed down a toilet by mistake

I'm kidding, of course.   -No, sure, you're.

You're speculating in a comic mode.

Yeah. In a humorous vain

We're not gonna let the little princess screw things up.

Right, Frank? If Gerri's going to block me, I want out.

I want my fucking package

I am halfway in on a Greek island

with my brother in-law.

Say, what's up, boys?   -Hi.

Okay

I've just been handed a piece of paper, Gerri

It's, uh... It has a list of wishes

in the event of Logan's death

Funeral arrangements, so on.   -May I?

Paragraph three.

And where was this found?

In his private safe

And this penciled addendum is what?

We haven't touched it. The underline in the pencil is his

Undated, apparently

Not even shared with his lawyer or myself, so.

So, what are you thinking?

Well, legally, since the family doesn't have full control,

Iegally, it... it wouldn't...   -Legally

it's up to the board to decide who's next, so...

Right.   -this is not germane.

Right, it's not germane. Not germane.

We were joking that it could fall in the toilet

Yes. Well, that is a very funny joke

You know,

they say it's a bad idea to make big decisions right after

Sure. But they also say

it's pretty smart not to pay realtors fees.

And it's such a bitch to get into these good buildings.

All right, well.

Hey, guys.

Hey, Con.

How are you faring?

How are you?   -Oh, you know.

Seen the obits?

Sure. You like the Globe photo?

Did any of you guys ever see him laugh like that?

Only if a hobo was on fire.

Yeah. I mean, to be honest, uh, Dad sounds amazing.

I'd like to have met Dad.

But you guys are okay, really?

Yeah.

Yeah, Roman has pre-grieved. Already gave at the office.

They don't fucking believe me

You know, from where I'm sitting.

you're the ones that look naive, okay?

I've been worried that this was gonna happen for ages

How you do in'?

I have no clue.

I'm okay.   -Yeah?

Yeah, I'm okay.

You okay?   -Me?

You're gonna laugh but in the middle of the night

I did a talk

like, a session. My therapist recommended someone,

and I got to him and he's... he's kind of good

I have his number if you want

Like, it's dumb but there's actually things you can do

I mean, sounds like you've got the best grief guy

I have a great grief guy. Fuck you.

You're gonna destroy this

Hi, guys. Uh, some more hard copies.

Obituaries.   -The reviews are in.

Great.

Yeah. They're mostly five stars.

And I think the board will assemble now at noon.

Okay, thanks, Hugo.

Okay. Ken.   -Yeah?

Can I, um... Can I ask you something?

Just for one second, sorry, just something quickly

Yeah.   -Just take a second

Private.

Ken, um, I may have, um...

caught myself up in a little bit of something

Probably nothing but, uh.

I'm... I'm sorry to bother you with this.

Okay. What?

Ijust found out that my daughter

she happened to sell a bunch of Waystar stock

just before the news about your father went, um...

went public

A total coincidence.

But I, uh... I don't want it to come up as an issue, y'know?

Did you speak to her on the day?

What are the phone records gonna say?

I can't recollect.

Hugo.

I don't even have a relationship with Juliet

that's the sad fact

The irony is, we hardly talk and, uh...

Thanks, Ken.

Anything good?

The Courier. You need a...

code book for this one. You ready?

Yeah.

"A complicated man."

Threw phones at staff

It's good.   -"Sharp reader of the national mood."

He's a bit racist.

Well, then. "He was very much a man of his era.

Again, racist.

Also, relaxed about sexual assault.

"Business genius."

Never paid a penny in U.S. Tax.

Oh, that's... Yeah.   -Boom.

"Well connected"

"Well connected" Now, that's not fair.

I feel like well  -connected is...

generally accepted to be a euphemism for pedophile

and no one ever suggested that he would, you know...

Fuck a child.   -Yeah

Yeah.

He wouldn't even hug his grandkids.

Hey, guys. Sorry. I think they wanna see you up in the library.

All right, let's go.

Thanks

Hey, Ken.

Hey, Tom.   -Hey, um, Ken, Ijust wanted to say, you know

I know there's a lot of water under the bridge, a lot of history

But as far as I am concerned, the... the big man passing

cleaned the slate. So, yeah. I just... Yeah.

I just wanna say that and you know, I wish, maybe

there's some things...

I could maybe take back, some words

And I'm sorry for your loss. But I want you to know

that I'm... that I'm here to serve. Right here

I like you, Tom.

Good luck.

Hey.   -Hello.

Hello.   -Yeah. Come on in. Have a seat.

What's up? Yeah, I know. We're in. Okay?

No, thanks.   -How are you doing?

Yeah. Hanging in.   -So, look.

I'm one of the executors of your dad's affairs.

This is not a legal matter.

But certain wishes have been discovered

And it appears at a certain point, undated,

it was suggested that it was your dad's wish that

Kendall take over as CEO.

Uh  -huh. From when?   -Well, it was in the safe.

Between pieces on the Raymada acquisition

and the first U.S. Virgin Islands reorganizations.

So, it's...   -It's old. It's... it's

So, as far as we can tell, from four years ago or so

Yeah. Then, it looks like there are

pencil addendums from another time, I...

We don't know its status. And I mean...

it doesn't hold any legal value.

But we wanted you to know

but we wouldn't want it to feel more significant than it should

Because the family no longer has majority control

of Waystar, so any such suggestions are non  -binding

Dad was the founder

So...   -O... of... of course,

it is from some time ago and things changed

And Logan was a man of different moods

Yeah. Yeah.

There are some additions in pencil

that he put in about artifacts.

And I think...  Can I?

We think from context,

uh, they were added maybe in the last 18 months

So, he underlined recently?

Underlined or crossed out?   -Shiv

Oh, no, no, no. I'm not saying for or against

I'm just... As a matter of fact, it's.

Are you serious?     -I mean,

I mean, it's kinda...   -Okay. Okay

let me see the thing

It's underlined or crossed out, it doesn't.

It doesn't really matter because it's...

Legally, it's the board,

yeah, who will choose.   -Exactly

The market, the shareholders, the board

we all want the sale to go through

So, it's an interim position, really

Sure. I mean, anyone could do that.

And since he said... I mean... I mean,

he has said...   -  -I mean, Ken.

Sure, man. I get it. But like, this... this thing is old

and you've tried to put him in jail, like.

twelve times since then. So...   -

I wonder what was the, you know...

the underlining or the crossing out

and the unknown age

if it... The document isn't essentially moot

You know, it's im... Impossible to decipher

Well, it sure as fucking shit doesn't say "Shiv."

Okay.   -So, what else

is in the fucking... Can you... I don't wanna...

Music, burial in the city, Catholic. You can see.

Should I get Greg now?

Just clear this up

Excuse me.

There's a mix of, uh, business and personal.

A watch for Colin.

Honestly, it looks like he drafted it himself

never sent it to his lawyer and just put it in the safe

I mean, mo... more of

a selection of musings, really

Some thoughts on the tax position

or some artwork in storage.   -What... what does he have?

He's got, like, a shit ton of, like, investment impressionisms

Right? Like, he's got, uh, three Gauguins

no one's seen for tax reasons, so

I think his suggestion was

it might be smart tax-wise

to just leave them in the Geneva vault

Oh, fuck it. Why not just burn them for the insurance, no?

Yeah, that would be the dream. Financially speaking

Hey, everyone.   -Yes

Hey, Greg.   -Greg

Hey.

In case it comes out

we wanted you to be aware that you're on a piece of paper

Uh, a side letter left by Logan with.

some wishes and disbursements.   -Okay. Yeah

In... in what, uh, capacity? In... in what fashion?

You're in addendum of miscellaneous matters

in pencil.

with a question mark.   -Nevertheless.

Dad may have said he wanted me to take over.

And so then, maybe the natural conclusion might perhaps be

I'd be his number two.

Nice try, kid.

He... he probably wrote it down so he can remember your name

We had a good rapport.   -You had a good rapport?

I feel like he already wanted to see less of you

That's probably, like, 50/50

fire Greg or kill Greg.

I think that it's not that kind of question mark.

I think it's uh um possibly...it's a wonder

It's a doodle. We just wanted you to be aware.

Oh, hey.

Sorry. Marcia wanted me to let you know that there's some words

down, some informal...   -Okay

Well, there's a lot to consider.

Should we reconvene before the board meeting

to pool thoughts?   -Yeah

Yeah.

Thank you.

Is it real, Frank?

I don't know.

My dad wanted me to take over?

Well,

sometimes. You know that he did. Sometimes.

He made me hate him, then he died.

I feel like he didn't like me.

I disappointed him

No. No. Come on.

We think these grand horror things,

at times like these, these ice shelves are gonna

come at us in the night and take our heads off. It's not true.

He was an old bastard. And he loved you

He loved you.

You think?

I think so.

If I get them in behind me, will you follow?

Ken, you've got stuff cooking

You seem so well.

You really want back in?

Part of me is just like

"Well, let's just give the poor orphan what he wants."

Sorry, I don't know what's wrong with me. That's not good

No, no, no. I get it, yeah

I mean, it is interim.

Well...

So long as it is

What do you mean? What are you thinking?

It's felt good. Us, right?

Yeah.   -And now, does this.

feel good? Like, does that feel good? It's.

How're you doing?

I don't know

You?

Well, he wasn't my dad but, you know,

he's...

It's sad.

Yeah.

I guess you already picked the wrong horse

You might've picked the dead horse.   -Don't

You'll regret it. Let me show you some kindness.

Not my thing.

You know, honestly.

I guess I'm just,

Slowly coming to accept that.

we killed him.   -Shiv.

No, we did. He died on the plane

And he wouldn't have been on the plane

except that we made him get on there

So that's just very cool.   -Anything could've happened

A million things could've happened

I just don't wanna fake myself out.

If we had said yes to GoJo, then...

he might've been around for 20 more years

So he could rock his grandkids to sleep

As he was evidently so keen to do.

Yeah.

Well, that's fucked now, isn't it? So.

Don't. Just stop

I'm angry.

My dad died. And my mom is a fucking disaster.

And my husband is

And Kerry, and Marcia, and.

It... it... it feels like I'm the only one who lost something

that they actually fucking

wanted here and it's not coming back, so...

Yeah

Siobhan, do you remember when

we first knew one another?

The first time in France when I flew to you?

And it was that very difficult time for you

And I'd sent you... all those handwritten notes.

And then the first time

that you were wearing that very... fine silk shirt

And I put my arm around you

I said, I kept asking, "Do you like this?

Do you like this?"

And you said, eventually, "I like it all."

Yeah, well...

That was a while ago, wasn't it?

Not that long

No, it was a while back

Colin does jeans?   -Yeah.

He doesn't know what the fuck to do with himself. Look at his arms.

He looks like a dog without its person

Fun.

Colin has a kid?

Shit. Didn't even notice.

What the fuck now?   -What do we think?

There's a dog... There's a dog in the house

Marcia.

Marcia, so, what's with the... the "Ruff-ruff"?

The Secret Service are conducting a sweep.

Jeryd Mencken is en route

I'm not sure that I want that today actually

I don't wanna see him.   -Yeah, he asked

He was a friend of your father's, no?

Come on. They spoke. But no, it-was transactional

Yeah. Not like all his real friends

from his men's group and choir

His two best friends.   -Come on, Rome. He didn't know him

'What's-his-face" And "Get-that-fucker-away-from-me."

He called him the spooky embryo

Yeah, okay. Look. It's

just there's all these fucking ghouls here.

So, come on.   -I just don't wanna see

his smirky, little autocratic face.

Probably gonna be president this time next week.

Okay. Well, I think I have a veto. My dad just died

I think I have a counter veto

cause, weirdly, my dad just died too

Guys, I think on a business level,

we need to have a relationship

Yeah. You do?

Now you do, huh?

Yeah.

Friends.   -God

This fucking day.   -Good friends, all.

When a great man passes

the angels of heaven weep. But when...

a giant of the conservative movement passes...

God. Now, we're having a kids' entertainer?

Who the fuck made him the king of the day?

Logan Roy was such a giant.

He was a man of humility, grace, dignity

Who died fishing his iPhone

from a clogged toilet.   -In public

he was a great communicator.   -Really?

A powerful man.   -Oh, man

So they say. Karl blocked it.

No.   -The man lives

on Wonder bread and steak frites

He hadn't had a shit for 20 years

He was a man of wisdom.

A man of humility. A man without vanity

He was a man who wasn't wearing his compression socks

So he could look hot for Kerry

... to make the world a better place.

He molded the country like clay in his hands

and made it into something beautiful

Into the shape of a dick.   -Come on.

He made it stronger. More coherent

When I think of L.R., I think

of a great lion of freedom.  I.   -Can you believe this shit?

He's trying to make Pop into a neoconservative.

He wasn't a neocon, he was a paleo libertarian

He was practically an anarcho-capitalist

Yeah, sure. I mean, if you like Benny Hill and Sinatra,

does that make you one of those things?

They're trying to body snatch him.

History's being written. The next 48 hours are crucial

Godspeed, for surely soon

Logan Roy will be running rolling news in heaven

How's it going?   -Hey

Shiv, I'm so sorry.   -Thank you

Hey, I'm so sorry, Shiv.   -Thanks

Thankyou for coming.   -Hey

Good of you to be here.

Oh, yeah, I'm so sorry. My dad was very affected

Yeah.

And so, why is he doing that with his face, can I ask?

That's just how his face looks these days

Oh, yeah? Frozen into a smile?

Please.   -He's... He's sad.

He knew your dad for a long time.

I'm sure... I'm pretty sure he just fucking winked at me

The news world...   -Sandy, it's Kendall

...is broken.

What is he doing?

I mean, I guess

they were close, Dad and him, so.

Yeah. Plus, he still has a board vote.

But, you know, I guess, who would you prefer

one of us or one of the old guard?

Everything all right?   -Yep

Oh, dear. Yes

Look who's crawled out of the woodwork

I told her not to do this. I don't understand.

Oh, God. Oh, she's coming over

Oh, it's so distasteful

Hi.   -Hello

I got your message but I just wanna go...

I just have some things of mine upstairs that I need

They're in a bag.

Kevin. Melanie.

I just need to go up, so...

Please. No.   -Thank you

Not upstairs.

I don't want her up.

Okay. I know...   -Come on. Easy. Easy

Don't look, Marcia

it's too unpleasant.  -Sorry, what's uh...

What's going on? You okay? Is this yours? You okay?

Yeah, I'm good. I'm good

I'm... I'm good.   -Cool? You're good?

Um, do you need me to help you...?

Sorry. I don't know if I have your private number.

Can you send that to me?

It's fine. I got it, I got it, I got it

Goddammit.

We were talking about getting married

and he was making arrangements about us, so could you check?

Yeah? Yeah, yeah. And, um...

He was gonna... He was gonna make a note

He was gonna write his lawyer or something

Please, can you check?

Can you check on it?   -I'm gonna check on it. I got it

Do I have your private number? I think...

Go ahead, take her out the back, yeah?

I can get it. I can get it.

Oh, God. Here come the waterworks

Out the back, Billy.

"Take her out the back, Billy." That's always nice to hear, huh?

Marcia, that was unnecessary, right?

We're calling Kerry a taxi to the subway

so that she can go home to her little apartment.

Nice.

Jesus.

How's your friend, Sandy?   -Yeah. "Who are you?

Why is this sex party so sad?"

Shiv, should we talk?

Yeah. We... we don't need to... Nothing needs to change too much.

Like, whatever you're thinking, you can... you can say

Fine. We should... We should definitely talk. Okay

Hey. Hey, Rome.

How are you doing?   -Hi. Great. How are you?

Yeah. I'm good. I'm okay

I just want to say, uh, tell me... tell me to fuckoff

if you like, really, but, you know, the, uh...

the piece of paper situation?

Yeah.   -Yeah. I heard about it.

And I, uh... I didn't wanna...

I don't wanna t... talk out of turn.

but we both know that Logan only wanted one person

to take over, and he just asked you back in

Look at you. Tommy -wommy. Tightrope Tommy

Riding his little subtle cycle across Niagara Falls, huh?

Tip -toe Tommy.   -Here to serve.

I'm... I'm here to serve.

Lip balm, Tom-wom. Lubing up his lips to kiss my butt

Hey.   -Hey, dude

That old fucking bastard.   -Yeah

Yeah.

I thought he'd be like my dad.

Ninety-five and just started suing the neighbor

What was it?   -Embolism. Pulmonary

Because I heard he saw

your Pierce business plan and choked laughing

You fucking prick

Hey.

Come on.

It's all right.

Hey.

So, uh...

Listen.

You gonna do the board call from here?

Uh, here or car

Because there's, uh...

there's a piece of paper with me on it.

That Dad said it should be me

Oh?

Okay.

Can you swing in for me?

You know me, you know my flaws.

It's short term.

I mean, you're really selling me right now. I mean...

I guess.

You know, my pubes got a little singed

the last time I went with you.   -Yeah

Remember? Yeah.   -Yeah

Well, yeah. That was, uh... That was a different...

different thing. For my family, I had to back down.

There was no card he wouldn't play against me.

Do you even fucking like the deal?

Yes. Yes, I do. Look, the deal has to happen.

We can't live in a haunted house

I have plans with the sibs

We... we'll take news and maybe fuse with Pierce,

but, you know, it'll be a feather in my cap

to bring in the deal

And you could bring it home? Dude. Ken

Is your fucking head on straight?

I'm twin track. I'm dead but I'm alive.

Yeah? Dive into work?

Dude, what are we gonna do?

Sit in the dark and d... drink Laphroaig?

And...

what's in it for me, Ken?

I don't know, man. Maybe do a solid

For your oldest pal the day after his dad died

How about that?

What do you think of the apartment, Mom?

Mm, it's very pleasant

We need to check all the walls

and see if they're structural. I'd actually like to make this

you know, bigger.   -Willa's mom.

God love her. Her plate is groaning

Hey, so listen. I think Stewy would swing behind one of us

Okay. Does she know she can go back?

And she dropped the grapes.   -Yeah

Her boat really came in, didn't it?

This is turning into the grand tour for her.

I guess the agenda for me is do we.

You know, do we agree to flying to Matsson?

You know that Connor's moving in, yeah?

Okay. What?

Well, Marcia gets it but she kinda

she... she sorta sold it to me.   -She did?

Let's all move in.

Grow old together,

share a bed like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory

We've got, like, ten till board time.

Yeah, you've spoken to Mom yet?

No. S... swapped messages. Shiv. Should... should.

Can we... can we... Should we talk?

Peter Munion was flying to Spain

and he tried to reroute to come directly here

because he wanted to be with us at this difficult time.

Oh, man.   -He sent a message

saying "It's a rum situation,"

and, "One in the eye for all of us,"

and also...   -Can you stop ignoring me?

Please, for fuck's sake, huh? Come on, please.

Let's talk about it.

We got somewhere. Us. We've got somewhere.

Yeah? Let's talk about it. I don't even care what happens

but let's not just give it to the fucking keystone fucks

because we didn't talk.

Con.

Oh, really?   -Do you mind?

Uh  -uh.   -Sorry, man

Mi casa es su casa.

So, what do you think?

You have an issue with me because

Yeah.

That's fine.

But I'd like it to be one of us. And yeah, uh, Dad said so.

Okay. Well, let's discuss but can you please just stop jonesing?

You're walking around the wake with a fucking hard-on.

I'm not. I'm...

All I am suggesting is that I swing it for us,

and then we move ahead, us three

Pierce, ATN, everything.

Okay, good. Great.

Well, I have some thoughts

Yeah. I guess I have some thoughts too

You're not pulling for Gerr-bear?

What, me? Hell no. No, I'm... I'm done

helping old ladies cross the street

But I do wonder about...

About me? Yeah.   -Yeah.

Okay.   -I think it needs to be me too.

Uh  -huh. Okay.

Yeah. We're doing what we do.

together.   -Well,

ultimately, that's how I want it

Man, come on. You're jerking over a piece of paper

that he scribbled your fucking name on.

There is an argument that you're the worst of both worlds

Different, but the same.

That plays, Shiv, it does, with the board

Same old but with a vibey new banner

COO is on the draft plan, right? Like,

right?   -Yeah.

I'm the COO.

And I know Matsson. And I was very close with Dad

We had a number of communications

that you were aware of and some that, honestly

now's not the time, but you were not.

And yeah, I just think we were close and honestly, Ken

it doesn't feel good, right?

For it to be just... you

Yeah.

So, them's my words.

Uh  -huh.

I see that.

Yeah. I see that, bro.

You do?   -Yeah.

I mean, Rome, it doesn't have to be just me.

I'm down. It makes sense.

M'kay.

And what about me?

Honestly, I just worry...

it looks like special pleading

Like, it's the COO's.

It's in the draft plan

I'm on the piece of paper

It... It needs to look fucking dry

and clean and tough

And I don't?

Yeah? I look too teary eyed and mascara streaked,

and like I might fucking faint?

It's clean enough.   -Shiv, it's not... it's not...

really... I don't think it works

You actually don't have experience.

It starts to look flaky.

I did the strategic review.

That was "Daddy make work."

And besides, I think two is cool but three is...

Like, three is...   -Three is a bit wonky

I mean, two is... fucking

and three is like some weird orgy for hippies.

I can't see the board going for three.

Well, I need to wet my beak

We'd only be fronting it.

I don't need to be front facing, and it's not about ego.

Really, it's the three bie. It's the team.

Yeah, you're inside everything.

Okay? This is like... I'm not trying to fuck anyone, okay?

This is just to sell, and yesterday was...

Come on. Like, yesterday was fucking... That was real

And I think we're...

I feel really good about this. This is... I think this is good

I need to be across everything.   -Everything. Yeah

Yeah. It's a holding position.

It's holding.

We'll do the deal. Spin ATN, fold in Pierce.

Six months, eight months.   -And that's all equal?

-Yeah.   -Equal as fuck, to the gram.

Cause you guys fuck me on this, and it'...

No.

This is a Dad promise. On yesterday

Yeah.   -On yesterday

On yesterday

Not gonna fuck you.

You guys wanna talk?

Ready?   -Yeah.

Okay

Okay?

Yeah?

I think, uh, pre-board,

we were just hoping it would be just us.

Oh, no. This is a good group

I'm just not sure it's appropriate for this discussion

Well, if you're uncomfortable, Frank, you can fuck off.

This is a lovely gang of pals having a chat. Okay?

Look, it's simple.

CoOs are on the draft emergency plan.

It looks perverse not to honor that

and it looks pointed for it not to be us.

Me and Roman step up

Well, uh,

when was the last time you spoke with your dad?

Like, 48 hours ago.   -And how'd that go?

It went well.   -Well?

Ken, the DOJ's all wrapped up

and everything you said about Logan amounted to nothing.

You're damaged goods

Whereas I shepherded in, um, a lot of cultural change.

I think we all know that Dad had soured on Gerri

I don't think there's anything on paper to that effect

But I'm not gonna push it.

We're obviously the people to take over for Dad

We were closest to him.

I think the board could have concerns

Well, Kendall's name is on a piece of paper

Logan said it should be Kendall

But when?   -A few times.

You've lost Logan.

And for his faults, he was the founder.

Ken and Roman

I think a Roy at Royco works

It's not for long.

So you can puppet master them.

Who? Me, Frank?   -Get the fuck outta here.

Come on.

There will be the renegotiation with Matsson.

I wanna do the deal and get out. We've got our own ideas

With ATN refreshed, there's a shape for things

For us, we have things cooking.   -Yeah

I mean, we... we know that the board is very excited

about the deal. So are we, it's a good deal

It is a good deal.   -Yeah.

History is happening.

Can you smell it?   -Sure

Roses and the rotting corpses.

Okay. Okay, it's done.

It's done. They voted it through

Ken and Rome?   -Ken and Rome step up from COO

Let's draft it, Hugo, right now.

Ken and Rome. All right!   -And I'll reply to...

Long live the king!

Long live the king!

And the other king.

Hi.

Everything well?   -Yeah. All great. All good

Great.

Yeah. Shut the fuck up

and stop laughing. It's not a comedy night

God. Ow! Ooh, shoot

Hey. Hey, honey.   -No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

Don't fucking touch me.

Stop... stop smiling!

No one comes in here

So, you're running the company

Congratulations

Yeah, yeah. Thankyou. Great day. Great week

Did you know he did Sudoku?

Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

he did them. I... I think I... I think I knew that

Oh, Jesus fucking Christ

You guys okay?   -Yeah.

Yeah?   -Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah.   -Okay, yeah. I'm sorry that we have to...

you know. But we are putting together the statement

announcing you and…

we'll go through all the biographical details

with your offices, and yeah, just wanted to check in

on Comms and PR.

And there's also a lot of guite difficult decisions, so...

Yes. I guess what we wanted to say

from a Comms point of view,

and listen, this is strictly Comms, but the markets

are gonna open on Monday

And, um, there are a number of ways

to solidify your guys' position. Okay?

When Logan was with us

we did everything we could to burnish his reputation

Now, you're taking over so we wanna do everything we can

to burnish your reputations

Yeah. I guess there are two ways to go

They're sort of.

Operation Embalm Lenin

or there's another way

Yeah, for the first option, we, you know.

just put together a nice package of photos with you and your dad.

You're a safe pair of hands, mention the piece of paper

And you're gonna follow what Logan Roy did to the letter.

Or there's a more complex, more fresh start

Go on.   -And this is, again

just a PR perspective, yeah?

There's gonna be an issue about your competence

And so, maybe, if we stress, for example

how involved you've already been previously

So, toughest version, we say that he was.

losing his focus towards the end

Okay. So, it's Operation Shit-On-Dad

No.

Yeah. Yes, it is.   -No

I think the piece of paper is strong

Okay.   -Okay.

You really think that people are gonna buy that

Dad was a fucking puppet?

It's just an option, Roman.

Logan Roy was a great man.

However, lately, the people around him

have been making the big decisions

His kids have been pulling the strings

I mean, we can go as far as you like.

I wouldn't, but it is our job

to say that we could go to Connor's mom.

Physical and verbal abuse. The Kerry situation

Okay. Well. That's... All right. Okay? Yeah, I... I... !

I do have, uh.

certain feelings of queasiness about, I guess

shitting on our dad while he's still up at Frank E. Campbell's

Yeah. Right now, I would say

considering our dad has just died

we should maybe not shit on Dad

Yeah. Thanks, Karolina.

You too, fuckface. But...

maybe don't bring us this disgusting shit ever again

Okay?   -Sure.

Thanks, anyway.   -Understood. Understood

Sorry. Thanks, Roman.   -Thanks, Hugo

Yep.Apologies

Hey, Hugo.

You know the stuff?

What stuff?

The bad Dad stuff.

Uh  -huh. Yeah.

It's what he would do. He'd want this for the firm.

Right. Okay.

So, action that. But soft, no prints.

Right. I mean, I don't wanna.

I'm a little concerned of freelance.

Can I get a sign off from Karolina and Roman?

No, pal. No. Down-low.

Just get on it.

Unless you want me to pull out the strap-on.
