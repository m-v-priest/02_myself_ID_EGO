\N\N第 4 季  第 2 集

Okay. Yeah. Everything..

Everything seems nailed down for tomorrow.

How you feeling?

Why does everyone ask how I'm feeling?

I'm sell in'. My decision. I'm feeling great

And yes, yes. Axe that chopper.

-They can fucking walk. -Right. Absolutely

-Office? -Uh, ATN

Surprise visit?

Happy Christmas, you clock-watching fucks.

But where they are, not to a significant degree.

Well, that may be true,

but NATO has a cultural weight.

So many olds.

Where are the hotties?

Yeah, I mean this needs the living shit kicked out of it.

A show about politics called Inside Baseball

What? -Yeah. How fuckin'confusing is that?

They have that?

Connor.

'Have we left yet?" Eyeballs emoji

Fingers crossed e moji and helicopter e moji

We're coming. -This is unbelievable.

Our PGN is just gonna crush this

Not quite yours yet.

Business retreat, Telly. PGN brainstorm.

Sunday Monday programming. Dookie

Tuesday, Wednesday programming. Dookie

Friday, Saturday programming. Massive stinky dog dookie

I gotta say, the upside is huge if we just broaden out

and stop over-indexing to college professors

Right?

Sorry, I just can't seem to tear my eyes away

from the bald man talking about NATO

-I have a boner... -So, my floaty, kinda

semi-pitch would be hardcore international news

from global-global to hyper local

Jess, would you watch that?

Uh, yeah... Uh, if it was on, totally

like, may be a focus on Africa?

Every day, just what is happening in Africa?

The Maghreb. Sub-Saharan East, Sub-Saharan West.

I would watch that shit

You would not watch that shit

-I would. -No, I mean, that... that sounds like

Homework : The Show.

No, the point is it's global reach

It's a network that teaches you how to watch it.

Or, shove all your... -Or?

.foreign report melatonin news hour

-info dumps in the daytime... -Yeah

Prime time, we go full Clockwork Orange, you know?

-Hey. -Yeah.

So, unfortunately, Gretchen Yung is conflicted out

Really? With Tom? He went with Gretchen?

Okay, uh, who's in... Who's in second position?

Crowley.

Okay. Uh, yeah, fine.

I contacted his office. He's also conflicted out.

Uh, and Kohl mayer, uh..

and Bulloch and, uh, and Camden?

Yeah. Yeah. Conflicted out. It's weird

Okay, great. I'll call you back

Okay, so, have we tied up all five now?

-Yep. -And they're all the ones

-that Mr. Roy's office gave us? -Yep.

Oh, God.

Hey, buddy.

Hey, hey, hey, hey. So, uh, so Logan's in

Logan's in?

What, upstairs? In the sales meeting?

No, he's on the floor, Tom. -He's on the floor?

Wait, explain to me exactly what he's doing

with his body and his face

I don't know.

He's just moseying. Terrifyingly mosey ing

He's wearing sunglasses inside

It looks like if...if Santa Claus was a hitman.

Okay. Okay, okay. Hold on. Hold steady. I'm coming in

Okay, Sergio, halt the car. Halt the car.

Okay, cancel the rest of my afternoon

-Hey. -Hey, Tom.

So, all the top attorneys are conflicted out. Yeah?

Dad teach you that? It's a fucking nice move.

Wow, does he wanna marry you now?

Um, I'm not sure I know what you mean

Oh, yeah, okay. So, you've met with or retained

every usable divorce lawyer in New York

just to fuck with me. Hmm?

I don't know, Shiv. I think may be Sara made a mistake.

You think I don't recognize my own dad's playbook?

Fuck you, Tom! -Shiv,

I... I did not intend for this to be aggressive

but I've seen what your family can do in these situations

and I want it to be amicable

I'm sure we can fi qure it out

Yeah, okay

You wanna be my dad's little bitch boy?

Why don't you deliver him a message, bitch boy?

Tell him to fuck off and stay out of my life

Okay, so what's happening? What's happening?

Okay, so he's stil I just kind a walking around

but with a slight sense that he might kill someone.

It's like Jaws.

If... if everyone in Jaws worked for Jaws.

Yeah.

-So, he did one big shout. -Right

He does not like

the countdown-to-election chyron s

he hates the new font, it's too small

It's too ingratiating. It's a really bad vibe.

What... what is this, do you think?

I don't know. Maybe he just wants to play your sex tape

on Late Night, Greg

No, the future starts now, Greg

You know, once... once the board rubber-stamps

and once the regulators nod the deal through

three, four months, Way star is gone.

This will be home.

So, he's gonna be here all the time?

In person? -Yeah. Yep. Yep.

Hanging around like the threat of nuclear war.

Here we go. -Go get him.

Hey, hey. Hey, sir, Mr. Boss Man.

One email

Fucking St akha nov ites in here

Please, don't exhaust yourself

What do you think of the, uh, election refit?

Oh, yeah, pretty fucking penny. It's an aircraft hangar

What's the air-con bill?

Well, yeah, Cyd really loves the sense of space

It's certainly interesting

Where is she?

Cyd? Oh, she doesn't tend to stay late

when it's opera season. Oh. Hey, Cyd

Oh, boss. I didn't see you. I was busy

But I can see that my social secretary's

been looking after you. -Have you watched the tape?

-Tom? -Hmm?

Kerry's tape. Have you watched it?

What do you think?

Of Kerry?

What do I think of her audition to be an anchor?

Yes

Well, did you... What... what do you think, Logan?

Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You go first

Well, I think... I think I liked it

-I mean, she's got something. -Oh, she really does.

Yeah, should we.

You thinking of giving her a slot?

Because I... I personally think

that... that could be a very interesting idea.

Right? -I'm keeping out.

She's my assistant.

It would be very unprofessional of me to get involved

Whatever you two geniuses think.

Now, I want to talk to them, a little speech

Somewhere down here in the middle

Man of the people.

Good evening, I'm Kerry Castell abate,

-and these are our top stories tonight. -Doing great so far

You look stupid

Missouri State poli... police... Missouri State Police

have issued an AMBER Alert... -Oh, my goodness.

As two children are believed to have been abducted

They were last seen outside the school gates

waiting for their mother to collect them

And then sudden smile

The police are appealing for anyone.

Must act natural to fool the humans.

And a new medical study has found that.

She's doing the shit out of this news

Can extend your life up to five years while three cups..

-Man, Dad was a god. -Can reduce it by two. Who knows?

Maybe it's time to switch to tea

But tomorrow, he's selling the empire to a 4chan Swede

and dishing out jobs for blow ies.

-Shiv? -Hey

Uh, Sandi, hi.

Uh, I hope you don't mind.

I was gonna try and send something

but I thought I'd just call'cause it's kind of urgent.

Hope that's okay. -Um, uh

yeah, no, of course. Um, what's up?

Is it about Connor's wedding?

Because that was such a regretful no.

No. No, no, no. This is completely different.

It's, uh, just about our chat and your pitch.

You know, I was just, well, thinking

may be I was a little hasty

Uh-huh! -Yeah.

And do your siblings feel the same or still no?

Well, no, I haven't had a chance

to talk to them about it yet, but I'm gonna bounce it around

see if I can't persuade them, because, you know,

I agree there's a... There's a lot of upside there

to get a little more money

Well, I mean, obviously, I agree,

but, uh, the board meeting is tomorrow, Shiv.

Uh, well, look, can I just.

Can I put you on alert,

just in case there is room for a discussion there?

And... and just to say that this is a live issue for me.

You know, may be..

Maybe we don't just wave this through. May be.

Maybe it pisses off my dad

but maybe that's okay

Yeah? -Yeah. Absolutely

Maybe we can circle back. Is that okay, Sandi?

And the USA Today..

Again, again, again. -It's so good. It's so good

Oh, what! Kinky!

One more. -Roll it through again

-Again -One more.

Go press the button.

Good evening, I'm Kerry Castell abate.

If he puts this on air, this is, like, easily packaged

as symptomatic of total loss of judgement and control. -Yeah.

Um, guys, they're actually.

Yeah, I know..

Transpo's on the tarmac.

It's waiting to take you to Connor's rehearsal

He's texting me.

Oh, he is? Yep. -This is... this is special

I... I'd prefer something a little more stable.

Yeah. Uh, no, there's no need for a song and dance.

Let's keep it cheap and cheerful

-Tom? -Yeah?

Will you, uh, do a little intro for me?

Sprinkle a little sugar? -Up... up there?

Yeah. -Of course.

On the... Yeah, sure. -Yeah.

Okay. Okay.

Hey, guys. Hey. Hi

Just want to say hi. Um, come on over.

Yeah, it's been a tough few weeks

Election coming into view, um..

Yeah, I appreciate you all and Cyd, my partner in crime.

And, uh, from my POV,you know,

keep cranking 'cause we're doing great

Up three percent in the demo week over week

But, you know, we can do more, uh

up 15 percent, uh,year over year.

And, uh..

Just... It's great work. And, uh, Just w... Real pleasure

to have the big man here to give us some, uh

some support. So, sir. Up you come

Okay. Come on up. Want help? No? Okay

I could give you a kiss from here

Good afternoon, everybody. Good afternoon.

Uh, 15 percent up year on year?

Well, it's a shame we're up 40 on costs,

but I guess... I guess it even s itself out in the end

I mean, does it?

Is 15 equal to 40, pal?

Is 15 equal to 40, pal?

-No. -No! Good!

Good head for numbers!

All right. You're good folks

You're the best or you wouldn't be in here.

But you've got to knuckle down for me

Way star, I can't say too much as yet.

but I'm going to be spending a lot more time in here

with you lot, because I love it in here.

I fucking love it!

So... I don't wanna know

about three percent week on week,

I wanna know that we're killing the opposition!

I wanna be cutting their throats!

Our rivals should be checking in

out the back of their chauffeured cars

because they can't believe what we did.

So fucking spicy, so true.

Something everyone knows but nobody says because.

they're too fucking lily-livered. Huh?

They can not believe what we said,

and the fact that we fucking said it!

They're fucking jam smears on the highway!

Now...

anyone, anyone who believes that I'm getting out

please shove the bunting up your ass

This is not the end.

I'm gonna build something better

Something faster, lighter, leaner, wilder

And I'm gonna do it from in here with you lot!

You're fucking pirates!

All right? All right? Yeah!

Who are you most excited about never having to see again

-once GoJo closes? -Uh, Hugo.

Frank Karl

-What about you? -Hey, uh

Wait，No.....no, -What？

We can't get on. -What?

don't know. Uh, there's a problem

-Excuse me. What? -There's a new policy.

-apparently. -What?

I don't know what this is

but, apparently, I'm not authorized

to let you take off

Who is? -The company has just sent word.

Uh, what? We are the company. -Yeah.

Our dad is the CEO. -Okay

Okay, okay. -Right?

-Yeah. -What?

-What? -What?

It's Dad.

He's fucking with us.

Right, he knows

we're out here making moves. -Okay

His feathers are ruffled

So, we're just gonna get on

and we're gonna figure it out later, okay?

I'm... I'm... I'm really sorry, I'm not able to let you board

-It's not authorized. -We have somewhere to be,

so we need to be on that chopper

and if we're not,

I'm gonna set aside several hundred thousand dollars

and I'm going to dedicate it to destroying your life

Is that great? How does that sound?

-I can't speak to that. --There she goes!

Okay, bye-bye. -Where's it going? What is this?

There goes Daddy

It's going back to the city. Buh-bye birdie

There it is. -Oh, man.

Wave bye to Daddy.

The fuck is this? Well, we're gonna be late now.

Connor's gonna shit.

It's gonna be a guilt trip to the fucking moon.

God dammit.

In Buddhism, sometimes your greatest tormentor

can also be, uh, your most perceptive teacher.

That's... that's really wise.

Um, hey, Buddha.

Nice Tom Fords.

-Okay, this is interesting. -Is it Con?

No, it's, um...

Where's the car? -It's, uh, Sandi and Stew y

they wanna... they wanna meet. Call or meet.

They'd prefer the meet

They're asking if we're gonna be back in the city..

-in the next one to two. -I mean, tonight?

No, it's about the board shit, right?

Like Stew y says that Sandi thinks

there's more juice to squeeze from the Swede

so they're just flying that again.

It's bullshit. -Yeah.

It's bullshit, Shiv. We've moved on.

-I agree with this... --Hey! Where's the car?

Fuckin'hippie. -Hey, where are they?

-They just left. --Yeah, they're... I..

He's just like... -Get a car!

I'm trying, I'm trying

Nothing from the board. I don't like this silence.

Give'em one last buzz round

Kerry, get Frank and Karl on to the independents.

Let's triple lock this down.

As severe thunderstorms are expected.

to hit Pennsylvania,

West Virginia, Virginia... -This shit's everywhere

And the Carolinas today

What is she doing? -To end our forecast...

-Hey. -Hi. We finished early, so..

Okay.

-What's going on? -Sorry?

Uh, just some prep for post-board meet,

the signing of the deal

It seems Mats son would love an actual photo op

I guess the question is,

is that something you would like?

-Or should we just... -What were you laughing at?

What?

What were you laughing at?

Uh, Gerri was... Um, we were chatting

and she said... something amusing, so..

Okay, okay, let's look at the options.

Um, look, I, uh...

I don't know if I should be seen shaking.

uh, Mats son's hand

I mean, he's been such a prick about the spin off.

Okay, uh, Karolina, can you do the option deck?

Well, you're ready to go in. -But can you do it?

Is your laptop not working?

Nope. -Well, just give it a go.

It appears to be working, give it a go.

Okay.

See if it... see if it works.

Here.

Severe storm.

So, here's the deck and it's... We got some great stuff here.

So, um, should we get into it? -Look, I don't wanna be

seen like some piece of fucking set dressing, okay?

I mean, the only thing is

everyone's saying the timing, the deal you've done,

don't you want your moment in the sun?

Oh, you working for Matsson already?

I'm still here, you know? I haven't gone. Huh?

You getting your Viking hat on early? Huh?

-No. -Nah.

Nah, this is bullshit.

Hugo, I think we might need someone

to go and suck off an independent director.

I'm concerned about the board. Put your fucking lipstick on.

Okay.

Is it worse to go up now?

I mean, I'd love to not go, but I think we kinda have

to drink at least a couple of

Martini Passive Agresso s just to make up, right?

Oh, you guys want a taxicab ride?

Taxicab? Come on, come on. Okay, what the fuck?

Flat rate. I'll give you good price.

Good price, good price. -Okay, what is this?

We're kinda pushed. -Yeah. Come on, man

is this a fucking ambush? Hi

No. We just wanted to do five in person.

Right, Sandi? -Yeah

we have a suite booked across the way

Well, guys, it's not exactly convenient

We're prepared to vote no on the GoJo deal

at the Way star board meeting tomorrow.

We think there's more money to be squeezed from the Swede,

and we think you're rushing this for emotional reasons

Hmm. Well, I don't think so. Okay, see you

The premiums look weak on market comparables, you know it

-Look at last week, Ro. -It's a different deal

it's not relevant. -Oh, come on, Ken

We want your dad to ask for more, but he stopped engaging

-He's palmed us off with Karl. -He does that

He can get the deal through without us

but if we can get you guys on our side,

we can force him back into the ring

for one last round

Okay, so I guess, like, board pushes back on price.

What's the big deal? -What's the big deal?

Okay. -Well, we'd have to weigh that

against the risk of blowing everything up

I think our position might be that

we're just done corn-holing our dad

But we... we just feel like your old man got hot for this.

Can't we cool him off?

Listen, listen. There's money for all of us

if we ask nicely. We push too hard, danger, danger

but, yeah, it's there. You know, it's there.

My dad is clear. He wants to vote no

-Yes. -Us, plus you guys, that's it

He's outvoted. This doesn't get through the board

Send it back to the table

-It doesn't need to go nuclear. -No. What..

Okay, it's not a big deal, let's just...

We'll think about it. Yeah

Okay, well, the board meeting's tomorrow

So, we need to know in the next hour or two

Okay. Sure. -'Kay?

So, it's either we vote yes tomorrow

and we all make billions of dollars,

or we sign up for your cool shit

and-then Dad dis inherits us entirely

That sounds like a toughie.

We'll think about it. Thanks. Bye

-Yeah. We gotta go. -Ken.

We're done. -Ken!

-I'll keep working. -Yeah. And I'll call Ken

-Oh, hey. -Hey.

So, you're here now, huh?

Yeah. No, sorry. What, are you leaving or..

You okay?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm... I'm just

I'm just going for a little drink

It's over? Is it done?

-The... the rehearsal? -Yeah.

No, no, but I.

I think they can take it from here on

Not vital from here, so...

I mean, the bride is normally..

I guess, is generally considered one of the first team..

in the old wedding, you know?

Yeah, right. Yeah, I should go.

You know, and, have a think. I'm in a bit of a fuzz

Everything feels very vivid today, doesn't it?

You okay?

What... what's... -Yeah. Fine.

What's going on?

You can't be jumping for joy the whole time, right?

No, I guess

Yeah, look... I should, I should go.

-Okay. -Yeah, bye.

Okay, bye.

Fairy-tale wedding

There goes the bride.

I have enough cash. -She is.

-I'll take her. -I mean, do we even go up?

It seems like it's over, so... -Well, I mean, yeah.

-I think we should. -What do you mean?

Yeah. Of course. --What do you mean? Yeah. No.

No, we're gonna... We... we have a lot to discuss

What? The fuck-y bullshit? No, come on.

Roman, look, a few weeks'pain could really set us up

And I think we over-promised

on Pierce and... -Just... It's a..

I just wanna...

Sandi mind game. -We're gonna go. Come on.

Fuck'em. Fuck those guys

Sure.

Finally. -Found him

Finally...

Here they are

-Hello, sir. Hugs ie. -We're so sorry, man

Thank you.

Yeah, Dad screwed us. Hey, bro.

Look at you. The Rebel Alliance.

How is it out in those hills?

Supply lines okay? Got enough to eat?

This is how it is, huh?

The battle royale. Me and Dad on one side.

you guys on the other?

You... you okay, man? We bumped into Will a

on the way in.

Yeah, I think it's all fine.

Yeah.

Will a stood up to do her speech and she said.

" I can't do this.

And she went to the bathroom for 40 minutes

with her so-called friends

Jesus. Oh, no, no, no. No, that is not... You're fine

That's totally fine. Don't worry about that

Just toss her another ten grand

or a snowmobile and some teeth whitening vouchers.

Any luck, Sylvia?

Will a's mom.

It's fine, Con.

-Okay so...This is so fucking weird

Do we regroup at my place?

Shiv. He's... Come on, he's looking a little rough

don't you think? -Well, sure.

I'm sorry that Dad fucked us, and I'm sorry that we're late

but we do need to decide fast, so.

-Well, I think we know, right? -Do we, though?

-Yeah. -They made some

pretty compelling arguments. -Sand i's a greedy little bitch

She's got her hand up the ass of the carcass of her dad,

and Stew y's just come along for the ride. It's a.

Fuck it. It's a packet of horseshit

Okay. What if I want to talk it through?

I just think... I think we rise above it, Shiv. Right?

No... May be.

Dad is not on it like he used to be

and maybe he's under played his hand

and the board are all a hand-fucking-picked

bunch of Japanese plastic cats just waving it through

Okay. Still incommunicado

I just really hope she's okay. So, what do you say?

Little bit of karaoke?

Or would it be possible to do anything other than that

-in the entire universe? -She's partying, I can party

I mean, we can go drink, right?

Little bachelor party for POTUS-SCROT US

Well, I mean, we three kind of.

-Sure. Everybody's busy. -We've got a...

Come on, let's give him a drink, sis

-Yeah. -Let's give him a drink.

Yeah, but not... but not... -Let's get him a drink

Your usual stupid places. Somewhere fun and real.

Away from the fancy dance. A real bar with chicks

And guys who work with their hands and grease,

and sweat from their hands

and have blood in their hair

I don't like these guys

They sound like a medical experiment gone wrong.

I don't know, he just said it's a big fucking problem

Well, why the kitchen? Should we hide the knives?

I don't know, he just said..

Loge. what's up?

Is all this pizza?

Why am I looking at all this pizza

It's killing me.

This is... It's out of control, Tom.

Right. -They send out for fresh pies

and there are two or three here already that are perfectly good

All you have to do is put them in the fucking microwave.

-Right. -Right. Noted.

I guess, just to say, it does tend to

it loses a s... There's a sog factor..

Greg, fuck off.

Okay.

it's not the pizza

I've been thinking about Kerry

Okay. Okay. Yeah, very excited. I mean, let's get into it.

She's a... she's a natural. She's got " It.

Is she the finished article?

Well, finished article, no

But you wouldn't expect her to be. -No.

No. She needs a little... Needs a little time.

May be, may be quite a bit of time.

Interesting

Yeah. She's, She's raw.

And I think, maybe we should think about

starting her way... under the radar.

And you know, she has a lot to learn.

A lot.

And I think... I think it can be damaging

to put talent out there too early

Smart.

Now, that's smart.

Yeah. Okay, sure. No problem

I'm not involved. I'm nowhere near this

-I know nothing. -Sure. Understood

America. -This is charming

I missed you

Okay, what's everybody having?

What do you want?

Do you think they know how to make a vodka tonic?

House red? Do I dare?

What? No, no, no. -That. Get that

Just a club soda with a sealed lid

Nothing from that tainted nozzle

Con, what do you want?

I'l I just have whatever a regular Joe would have.

Just, Belgian Weissbier. Not Hoegaarden, ideally

-Hey, have you seen this? -Hmm?

From " Heard on the Street "..

About what the Way star price will come out at?

Sandi shared, so I..

Hey, can I get, um, a vodka tonic

I'll have a bitters and soda.

You still, uh, with us, Con?

Oh, sure. Just Willa. I have her location shared

I just think it's a factory setting

It's not.

Yeah, well anyway, I'm reassured

She's definitely not on her way to Cuba

Well, her phone isn't. -Yeah, she's stopped moving

I guess she found a spot she likes

Sure. -On another man's dick

On a much bigger

nicer, harder, younger dick is all I'm saying.

Can we not? Can we not, d... -Okay. Sorry. I know

Dude. You know,'cause I'm feeling..

I'm... I'm having certain anxieties, huh? -Okay, sorry

I mean, I... I wanna have a good time.

Okay all right. -Let's have fun.

We can monitor her dot together

She's... What? -Let's get it up

on the big screen. -Why so long at the.

Her dot is at a aquarium supply retailer.

That doesn't make sense. Is that a drug thing?

I love him. -No

You sure?

I am sure.

It is. It's a drug thing

Sorry. -Now, she's a t a dry cleaner's

She's, uh, probably getting her panties cleaned

Mussed'em up a bit. That's really tough. -I'll be right back

What's wrong with you? -Drinks are right here.

I'm not saying it's your cum.

-No, stop. -Your cum, I'm sure, is very.

Stop. Stop. -Washable. Okay.

Yo, Lukas. What's up, brother?

'Sup?

I can't fucking sleep.

You sleep good?

Honestly, not really. No

Well, I've never met anyone I respect who sleeps good

Tell me about it. One eye open, bro. One eye open.

Yeah. And secondly, my... my team says

I shouldn't be talking to you about this.

but,whatever

Well, I've been... I've been hearing that, uh

the activists hustling on the price

are trying to get you to join their little, uh

scheisse party. Is that true?

Well, I can't, uh.

I can't give you a play-by-play, but..

Well, I.. I know that you tried to screw this deal with your dad

and I know your dad hates you now.

So...

You're out of options, huh?

And I've also been hearing that you've been going around

offering old ladies suitcases full of money

Well, if you want to have a full suitcase anytime soon,

you... you don't push me, okay? -Okay, dude

-You're... He's gonna sell. -I hear you, man.

But if he pushes me again, it won't be to me.

This isn't aggressive.

Like, uh, I've been told that sometimes when...

When I'm direct, it can code aggressive,

but it's not, it's just.

Look, I like you, I like you. I do

I thought clarity, you know, before any nukes get launched

Okay?

So, either back off, or I'm gonna walk

-I got you, loud and clear. -Okay.

I think that's it, K-Roy. -Yeah. Sweet dreams

Storm warnings have been issued in parts of the east,

as severe thunderstorms are expected to hit Pennsylvania

and the Cali... Carolinas today

And our forecast to la..

This is an incredibly delicate piece of diplomacy, Greg

Okay? It's like Israel-Palestine,

except harder and much more important

She's not gonna be happy

Right.

But I think I see a way through

-What's that? -You tell her

Yeah, in... interesting

I mean, I... I don't... I don't like it

Well, you're a little frustrated?

Yeah.

You wanted next-level tasks, right?

Yeah, but not like

telling our boss'girlfriend she can't be on TV

Honestly, I think... I think it tracks

This is what you do, all right?

You go to her and you say... Like you say

" It's really hard

even being the cousin of this family.

and you've seen what's happened to the kids

You know, things get muddled..."

And... and then you tell her she's good, but not too good

and then you... you... You make sure Logan's out of it

and I'm out of it and you tell her

that the focus group had thoughts

-Mm, okay. -And then you ask her, you know,

does she even really want it

handed to her on a silver platter?

You know, with all the resentments and accusations?

And then you can make it seem like it's her idea

-to cool things, right? -Okay

-Yeah? Good. -Yeah

But if she's like

" Fuck you, Greg, and I wanna be on TV tomorrow.

ATN is my home..." -Well, then, if that happens,

just back away to a position of safety

and I will march in and mop up the rage, okay?

All right.

Oh, god dammit.

Well, I'm having fun.

Hey, what's up? What did I miss?

We're eating

Yeah? -Right here.

Billy Ray Cyrus's Kentucky Fried Shit Shack

Well, they seem to have some hearty fare

What was that shit? -Uh, Stew y

Oh, great. What the fuck now?

Well, actually, guys, can I... can I..

Can I show you something?

-Yeah. -Oh, wings!

I wonder from which particular creature they snip these wings

It's, um... -Perhaps a mammal

On the comparables.

It's... it's actually pretty fucking intriguing

Okay. Well, it makes you think

May be Dad isn't on it like he used to be

You know, he's been pushed around by Mats son

and fucking being pushed around by Kerry.

Giving shows to his girlfriend? That's just..

Fuck, she's in the East River. She's in the fucking.

No. -What?

She's on the bridge

She's headed to, uh, Williamsburg

Not to be dicks, Con, but is it okay

if we do a little breakout chat,

just the three of us?

-We won't be long. -What?

Like, two minutes max. -Hey, fuck it.

Why don't we fold Con in?

Well, he's not on the board, so.

Yeah, but he has a share, so if the deal.

he loses his payout

Excuse me? -Oh, yeah. So, Shiv wants

to get us mixed up in some sort of drug de a

that will fuck the vote tomorrow

Uh, no. A small delay, we all want the deal

Okay. -And, look, I think I agree.

Oh, what the fuck now? -Yeah, just.

Seriously? -It's just

looking at the numbers...

-Yeah. -It's... it's compelling

-Yes. -It's compelling? Come on

So, you're gonna force Dad to grovel?

Oh, man. How long will a renegotiation take?

It's a play.

More money is more money and that's all there is to it.

Oh, I'm sorry.

What the fuck?

Uh, Roman...

The fuck is Dad messaging you for, Rome?

Uh, I don't know. Ask him

Stupid question.

You're not gonna read it?

Yea h, I'll read the... I will, yeah

I'll read it, sure, Um, uh, just a check-in.

Oh, yeah?

A check-in? -Yeah. Yeah.

Oh, yeah, you're right. Classic Dad.

He always just checks in

Just wants to see how you're doing

Okay, I sent him a text on

his birthday just saying, " Happy birthday.

Uh, " Sorry we missed it." -I'm sorry.

wait a minute. You texted him initially?

On his birthday. Yeah

We said no contact until he apologizes

Okay, well, so then, never?

You know what? -What?

I think I would like to see your phone.

-Oh, really? -Yeah.

Show me your phone. World's biggest What s App group

of people sharing pictures of your snatch

No, thanks. Fuck you. No. -Rome? Guys? Rome

What?

We have to trust each other here

So then fucking look. I don't give a shit.

Great. -It's dick pics anyway.

He's got a real taste for'em now. -Great.

It's this right here. Read. Who gives a shit?

Well, this is more than one text

-It's two, three. It's... -Yeah.

Yeah, it's more than one. Sorry.

It's a bit warm. -It's warm? Why? What did I say?

-" Take care." -" Take care "?

What am I supposed to say? " Happy birthday

Hope you fall down a flight of stairs, shithead.'

You know what? I feel a little bit weird

about this betrayal

The betrayal? -Yeah

Yes, the... the betrayal of,

" Happy Birthday, Dad. Take care. Roman.

You know what? -Yeah

Betrayal? -I do, too.

Okay, great. Fucking family guilt trip

European vacation. Let's do it

It's hard. It's been hard on everybody

You know that he advised To m on the divorce?

Gave him a Dad trick

Went and spoke to every pit bull in Manhattan, tied'em up

I got Mom med.

I mean, there's probably one more

horrible motherfucker lawyer

somewhere in the United States if you wanna look

but, um, yeah, that sucks, I'm sorry.

Guys, I feel like we need to stick together

And we should push back, and you should come with us

and we should put the squeeze on

Okay, but, we want to do Pierce, right?

We want to out, right? -Yes.

Yeah. Yeah, exactly. -Okay

Just with just a bit more money

Yes, but I don't think Mats son will go up in price

He won't. I know this because I have spoken to him

Oh, well, if that's... If that's what he said

then it must be true. Yeah. -Okay, seriously

I think he might walk. -Oh, might he?

-Yes. -Yeah, do you think

he could may be, like, is it a possibility

he could say a... A not... -Okay

Like a thing that isn't, a lie?

I mean, why would he say that?

Well, it's Negotiating 101, Rome.

Did they not teach you that in management training?

All right, but he... It sounded like he meant it.

Oh, yeah. That's Negotiating 102

-Okay. -It's pretty basic

Look, I know the conflict isn't nice,

but we over committed on Pierce... -Wait, what?

-And this gives the cash... -I don't give a shit

about conflict. -To make it right.

Like, I will conflict fucking conflict.

-Yes, you do. Oh, okay, fine. -No, I don't

Well, it is about Dad feelings for you then

Dad feelings? -Yeah

If anyone here has fucking Dad feelings,

it's holy shit, poking Satan with the fork

I'm genuine about us three.

And stop ganging up on me like you're Lennon and Mc Cartney

and I'm fucking George. I'm John, motherfuckers.

Ringo, Yoko.

He's still Connor, but

he won having drinks with us at an auction

Honestly, though

I think... going with Sandi and Stew y

is... is the best thing for us to do..

Yeah. As a team.

It's just a... it's just a move

It's a... it's a delay, a couple weeks

He'll get it. It's what Dad would do in his prime.

Exactly.

I guess if it's just a play, then yeah

Fuck, yea h, I'm in.

God fucking dammit

God fucking dammit. -Sorry. Sorry

You ruined it all, you fucking ruined it all

Con, Con, Con. -Sorry.

You fucked it up

-What do you wanna do? -What do I want to do?

I wanted to get married tomorrow

-Well... -I wanted to spend tonight

with my family and tomorrow with my dad

and I wanted to get my fucking money out

What else can we do?

I would like to sing one fucking song at karaoke

because I've seen it in the movies,

and nobody ever wants to go.

Hey, hey, Kerry, um, s... sorry.

can I possibly please, uh, grab you just for five minutes?

Quickly, please, right now? -Yeah, why not?

You've already grabbed every other woman in Manhattan.

Thank you. Let's... let's just head in here.

I just wanted to grab you for a quick moment

Um, uh, I... I hope I'm not getting above my station here.

Um, but I wanted to talk to you about the whole tape thing

Oh, I... I'm not sure I wanna talk to you about that

Oh, yeah. No, fair enough. Then, just as a friend I.

I wanted to give you a heads up on the down-low

on what the murmurs are, and say, you know

how careful I have had to be

about my particular position as a family member

and say how people chatter so unpleasantly

about accusations of legs-up

and unfair... -What is this, Greg?

Just…

Are... are you...

rushing things a bit?

And could... Could that, long term

-actually harm your position... -So, okay, Tom doesn't think

-I'm ready and he's sent you... -No, no, no.

No, no, no, not at all.

Uh, he thinks you're great

I mean, there's some little doubts from a focus group

and they're... -They focus-grouped me?

Yes. But... but the big picture is, what I'm saying.

You know, like, how Kendall and Shiv

-have an entitlement problem? -Okay, I'm sorry

What did they say, the focus group?

Uh, well, headlines, great..

just maybe not fully there.

And a few criticisms,

but... but... -Such as?

Uh, minor shit, like, nothing. I mean, may... Great package

Uh, may be a little, you know, arm... the arms aren't right

you know, or they're a little un-TV

The arms aren't right?

No... Yeah, but... but not a biggie

No, it's fixable with a few years

But, uh, no sorry, on TV, this is on TV

and it can happen th... that they shoot weird, the cameras..

So, who was in this focus group, Greg?

Just you?

-No. -Is it Tom?

-No. -Logan?

No.

It... it's a bunch

of grandpas and little twerp s and such.

Can I see it? -No.

Because? -Because it's private

-Well, it's not. -You can't.

What if Logan wants to see it? -It's... I'm sorry

it's confidential. -From the CEO?

-Yes. -Okay. If this focus group isn't real

I'm gonna take you apart like a human string cheese.

Understood

I did the job. I did the job

Heard from Connor.

Okay?

The kids, Sandi and Stewy, they have the numbers

to force us back to the table

W... what? What do you do? You want me to call?

You want me to ream'em out for you?

No. Delicate.

They have some juice here.

They have some fucking juice.

You should share your fucking dot with Willa

Then, she'll see that you're out having fun

I love karaoke,

it's great. Boo, boo! Your wedding is doomed

I said may be

Okay. -Thank you.

So, what happens now?

Uh, well, someone has to humiliate themselves

in the shame palace.

Think they have " Desperado " By The Eagles?

I would imagine they do. Longest night of my life

Oh, shit.

-What? --She's gone dark

Why has she gone dark? I mean, is this it?

Is she going off with some buck

and they're gonna, you know? -Hey, take it easy

May be... may be her phone just died.

Yeah. Have you ever considered

that she might not be right for you?

This could be good. Yeah?

Connor? -You'll meet someone else

You're not doing better than Will a

I would agree. Do not let Will a go

Romulus

So, Dad's on his way.

What? -He wants us to meet him

down at the car

when he gets here. -What the fuck?

How does he know we're here?

-How do you know he's coming? -Well, I told him

that it's the night of a thousand wobbles over here

and he needs to talk to you. -Oh, for fuck's sake, Con

My life isn't filled with secrets like some people.

I share things.

And I want my father to be at my wedding

You mean you want the money? -Well, no, Siobhan,

that was not my primary consideration.

I mean, what do we do? Do we... do we leave? I mean..

Will he come in? He's not coming in, right?

You know what? Just be water, my friend.

" Just be wat "... Wow, thanks, man

What happens if I kill a Buddhist?

Do I get reincarnated as a fucking Buddhist?

I hope not.

It's four in the morning. The end of December

I'm writing you now Just to see if you're better

New York is cold. But I like where I'm living

There's music On Clinton Street

All through the evening

This is Guantanamo-level shit

-I hear that you're building -What is this, Con?

Your little house...

I think I'd like to hear " Desperado." Please?

Deep in the desert

You're living for nothing.

Uh, okay. I don't know why Dad's calling me

Well, really he should be calling me.

What did we say? Don't answer it.

I'm not.

Hang up.

I could just, uh... Hey! I was gonna let it ring out

Oh, shit! Of course. I didn't think of that.

Mm, with a lock of your hair

Oh, my God.

Hey.

Oh, shit.

Can we, uh, go somewhere else? These lights are.

I could have a seizure

We're not going anywhere. -Fine. Very well

Okay.

Uh, we won't be needing you, Kerry. You can...

Oh, yeah. -Thank you

This here is a... A family fuck-fuck, so.

Ignore me.

Okay, let's get this figured out

and then I can let you get back to your fun

Well, it might've been a wasted trip

Wanna give us a quick blast of " New York, New York " And fuck off?

Well, I... I wanted to say something

Yeah? Reasons we should vote through the sale?

It's... No surprises there

Unless you do it to the tune of " The Girl From Ipanema.'

Well, um, it's not that. I mean, um, uh, aside from this

um, I guess I..

I guess I just...

I... I wanted you there a bit at my party

Holy shit

Did Dad just say a feeling?

Well, you know, I just..

I thought maybe it would be nice.

Oh, fuck. Now... now, it's all coming out.

Oh, my God, Mr. Melodrama over here

It's like a fucking telenovela

Come on, guys, he's trying something

Look, you knew I wanted Pierce

from way back.

And when I lost out.

that was not a good feeling

Yeah, no shit.

We practically had to walk back from Albany

Can we just... I'm sorry. Can we cut the shit?

It's obvious why you're here

Your father wanted to address the personal stuff

and not just launch into the business

Well, see, this isn't personal, Dad

Uh, this is a business decision. This is about the money.

Look, you're smart to ask about the money, you are.

But Mats son won't go there

You haven't been around this, but I've got done a good deal,

and you'll get enough to do whatever you want

I do ATN, you do Pierce.

It'll be a fresh start for all of us

It'll make things better, and it starts there.

All you have to do is vote yes and support the deal

Do you know what he's offering?

You can separate the personal and the business, you can...

Hmm. Reset your dynamic as a family

Oh, super.

We gonna be just how we, like, we used to be

and... and... and go on summer va cay together

and drive down Route One in an RV singing show tunes?

It may be more complicated than that.

Yeah, I mean, I guess

you're still in the honeymoon period

so... getting your own show on TV

Oh, are you not gonna be on TV now? No?

I'm sorry, is thATNot..

Has he fucked you on that?

That'll happen, the fucking

But congrats on losing your betrayal cherry

Enough.

I thought you'd be interested in an apology

but that... that's enough. -Wait, I'm sorry

An apology? We... we missed that.

Look, I don't do apologies.

but if it means so much to you..

then sorry

There's nothing you could say to me now

that I would ever believe.

This deal push could be worth 100 mil to us, Dad

How many sorry s do we get for that?

Okay, to be clear...

What are you actually sorry for, Dad?

Well, I'm sorry

for the helicopter for a start

You guys, he's sorry about the helicopter from today

Well, that's the big one, I guess.

Are we actually doing this, Dad? -Okay

Cause I think, you know..

Seriously, what fucked all this was when..

-with Mom and Italy... -Yeah, okay

I've had certain thoughts about that

Look, with the best of intentions,

I, uh, I got the structure of the holding company

the ownership structure of the, um, family trust

There is a lack of clarity and may be

maybe you got certain impressions..

Amazing. You sure you're not having that seizure?

I mean, he is trying, right? And what you said

you were interested in was an apology

Okay, then. Anything else?

Come on, Dad. What are you sorry for?

Sorry for fucking ignoring Connor

his whole life? -Bit strong

Hitting Rome when he was a kid?

Oh, no. I mean, everyone hit me.

I'm fucking annoying

For having Connor's mother locked up?

Can we not do a whole show trial here?

What about advising Tom on my divorce?

Yeah? I mean, that one... That took effort

That was above and beyond

Tom asked me for advice

I recommended someone he could speak to

You weren't around

If you'd been around, I would've offered you

the same advice.

But I can't help you if you won't see me.

Look, the bottom line is if we ask for more money.

Mats son walks. I know that. -No! You don't know that!

You don't know him!

You don't fucking know everything

Just'cause you say it doesn't make it true.

Everyone just fucking agrees with you and believes you

so it becomes true and then you can turn around

and say like, " Oh, you see? See? I was right."

But that is not how it is. You're a human fucking gaslight!

Fine.

Look, I... I just want to get us all together.

What you kids don't realize, this is a good deal

The world likes it. It makes sense.

But deals have a habit of disappearing

because pricks like Mats son get pissed off or snap. This..

This is fucking real

Okay, well, I think I can speak for everyone, can I?

When I say, " Go ask him for more money.

But why? -Just good business sense.

Gotta make our own pile

-Right, Dad? -Oh, come on!

Yeah, I mean, it's what my gut is telling me

and so I gotta listen to my gut. It's... it's all I got to go on.

Jesus.

You're such fucking dopes. You're not serious figures.

I love you...

but you are not...

serious people

Look at this prick. They should get out here.

Some cunt doing the tin cans for his supper

take a sip of that medicine.

This city... The rats are as fat as skunks

They hardly care to run any more.

I don't know. I don't fucking know.

The meeting's off

I need to see Mats son. It'll be you, me

Tom, Karl, Frank.

But no Gerri.  -Fine.

So, how was it for you? Fucking Dad

Amazing, just over too soon.

I could've kept going

Rome, we're kidding, man. Kidding

No, I know. It's fine. It's cool

Okay. I'm going home.

Well, I'm sure she'll be in touch, Con.

You know what? It's fine.

-Really? -Yeah.

The good thing about having a family

that doesn't love you is you learn to live without it

What? Con...

You're all chasing after Dad, saying.

" Love me, please love me. I need love.

-I need attention." -I think that's the opposite

of what just happened. -You're needy love sponges

And I'm a plant that grows on rocks

and lives off insects that die inside of me

Jesus Christ, Con

If Will a doesn't come back, that's fine.

Because I don't need love. It's like a superpower.

And if she comes back and doesn't love me.

that's okay, too,'cause I don't need it

Thanks for the party

Yeah, you're welcome.

Mark Raven head

and Jery d Mencken is coming up tomorrow night

It really is a must watch

Hey, Dad.

Hey! Lookie, lookie here. Twin Cities Tessie.

I thought I smelled dairy

So, um, that just felt a bit weird

and there was a lot going on, so..

Oh, we know what they're like

I've pushed the board meeting, I want you to come with me

and see Mats son tomorrow. I could use your help

Oh, yeah?

Uh, I mean, it's the wedding. Con's wedding

Uh, but that feels... Yeah, let's see.

Tom?

Yea h. I'll give you a moment. -Thank you

Okay, yeah, sure

Here. -Okay.

There's a Night of the Long Knives coming.

C yd's to as t. I'm reinventing ATN

I need a fire-breather

A ruthless fuck who'll do whatever it takes.

-May be I should go. -You're not Pierce.

Smart people know what they are

I mean, you really want me at A TN?

More, Romulus. More.

I need you.
