\N\N第 4 季  第 6 集

Take one. Mark.

Let us know when you're ready

What this new product offers is community

Safe, secure community, enriched with

the integrated interactions with the cherished family

of Way star's movie and TV characters.

I'm convinced that the Living Plus real estate brand

can bring the cruise ship experience to dry land

and provide a significant boost to the earnings

of our parks division.

I couldn't be more excited.

And I...   -Can I stop you there?

Sorry, the... The thought is…

Can we may be do just... just one more.

The thought was just maybe a touch more upbeat

That was the thought, was it?

Just be good to

get it as good as it can be

You think we should get it

"as good as it can be "?

Could... Could you may be sound

more excited when you say the word "excited "?

Okay. So... He's a little shiny

Can we... Can we get... Angela, are you nearby?

Just a little shine. Thank you

Can you please stop buzzing around me?

God, you're fucking useless, the lot of you

You're as bad my fucking idiot kids

That's... That's bullshit.

Sorry... sorry, Ken.

That... that's fine. That's a Valentine's card

Could we watch it again, actually?

Absolutely

Good to see you, Dad

I'm convinced that the Living Plus real estate brand.

Hey.   -Hey.

So?   -So, what?

What, you came 3000 kilometers

and you can't come another 20 meters?

Yeah,

see, I'm just stopping at a convenient location to refuel

and there is no reason for me to get off the plane. So...

Bye.

Hey.

Hi.   -Hey

Tired interior.

Don't criticize my jet interior. It hurts.

So?   -Nothing. Nothing...

Just thought I'd check in, you know

With the whole, the whole product launch, investor thing?

Living Plus.   -Yeah

Why... why are you doing this bullshit?

Well, it's on the calendar

And if we decided to cancel the product launch.

it would look like we were just minding the shop

until you came in.   -Well, you are, right?

I don't... I don't need it

It's fucking Land Cruises.

Living Plus.

Li... " Living Plus."   -Yeah

No, it's... it's Land Cruises.

'Hey. You know how shitty and heartbreaking it is

being locked up on a cruise?

How about that, but you also get to stay

in the same fucking place the whole time?"

I'm not gonna pursue, so why would you announce?

Well, that's presumptuous.   -Okay.

So, here's my situation...

The deal is going through, with velocity

and lots of it... Lots of you I... I really like

But lots of it I also really hate.

Lots of rooms I never want to go into, okay?

So there's... There's a..

If there's someone on the inside who... who understands all that

but also gets me...

That could be...

could be of, value

God.   -Come on. We're buddies.

Can we just talk, like...   -No, may be I hate you

No, you can't hate me, you don't know me well enough

May be I love my brothers very much

By the way, did they mention

that they went totally fucking mental on me

up above Andalsnes?

Totally unprofessional, totally dumb

Look. You spoke, I listened, but I... I gotta go now

I think my... Yeah, I can... My flight's leaving.

Yeah. Start the engines!

Okay. Well, you keep me looped.

My girl on the inside.   -Fuck you,

my boy on the outside.

You know, I'm gonna tell my brothers everything you said

Cool. Do that.

Nothing to hide, nothing I wouldn't tell them myself.

Okay.

Enjoy L. A.   -Bye.

Hey. Welcome.   -Hey, hey. Morning.

Morning.   -Welcome

Thanks. Thanks for, everybody, for finding time.

Our CEOs wanted to give us a sensitive..

Yeah.

In-person update on negotiations, correct?

Correct. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for being here, guys

I know everybody's swamped with, Investor Day

and we've... We've got the product launch

so... so... so, I'll make this brief, but..

Did I... I'm sorry, Shiv.

Look... Overall, very excited

Super excited.

Just, questions about, Mats son's full understanding

of the whole business

We're... we're pleased with the offer we extracted

It's... The price is great.

I mean, you knocked it out of the park, guys

I mean, really.   -Thanks!

Hear, hear. Hear, hear. But it's just.

as... a s we're preparing our board recommendation,

we wanted to share some confidential context

with this senior group and seek your advice

Yeah. I mean, long story short, Mats son exhibited some

what you'd call erratic behavior that made us concerned.

What... Well, what exactly happened?

Well... Yeah.   -Well, we were pushing him, gently

on what we wanted, how much, and then he fuckin'

How would you describe it like?   -I would describe it

as a meltdown, human Chernobyl.   -Yeah. Right

But, like, specifically.

Specifically, he was, like, shouting about how

you know, we didn't know what a good deal was,

and how he didn't even especially want the deal.

He didn't want the deal?

Yeah, like, his senior leadership team, liked it

but, you know, we better take what was on the table

But that... That smells like a negotiating tactic to me,

'cause he made the offer.   -I mean, may be.

It wasn't really coherent. He was sort of, like

saying that he was stringing us along

and that he could, you know, pull the deal and.

So, what are you suggesting?

Can we recommend a deal with a person of this character?

Given everything else and so on? Tweet s, drug rumors.

You know, 50 percent in stock, that means we are exposed.

Shall I go? Okay, it's a worry.

It's, a concern and I think we should monitor it closely

I don't think it hurts

I mean, he's, a genius

Nobody minds a genius acting weird.

Honestly, it probably kind of adds to the mystique.

And we know that his bank

and legal team are, right now.

progressing in a very professional manner

I just... What... what's... What's to worry? It's..

His reputation is priced in.   -Absolutely

Good. Yeah, okay, we feel covered

Sure. Yeah.   -Right? Just... Just

letting you guys know and, we should..

we should move ahead with what we know

Thank you for keeping us informed.

Thanks, guys.

Thanks, Frank.

Big day tomorrow. Big product launch.

HI

We... Sorry, we didn't mention

We... We were just... We're hoping to keep things dry

Yeah. Yeah?

Yeah.   -Yeah.

I think vanity stopped us, maybe.

We were proud of the deal, from raising it earlier. So..

Yeah. Sure.

What?   -I know you.

What?   -I fucking know you

What?   -" What "?

Yeah, what?   -" What?"

What?   -I Fucking hell.

Boys, you're not good at this

Hey, Dad? Shiv spilled chocolate milk

in the Range Rover."

Yeah?

You're trying to fuck the deal.   -No, we're not

No? Yeah?   -No, we're not trying to fuck the deal.

But you failed to mention this very

fucking interesting incident, even as a bit of gossip?

Shiv..

Yeah?   -No.

No? I'm wrong?

Go on, lie to me. Lie to my face

We're not sure about the deal

Thanks, fuck face. Excellent

Just, what am I...   -Yeah. I mean, no, great.

Throw me under the fuckin'... Great. Nice.

Shiv, I mean, the plan was to tell you. We were..

Honestly, we were protecting you.

Thanks so much

Yeah, don't get mud on my confirmation dress.

Thanks so fucking much.

Well, it did go nuts on the mountain, Shiv

He was talking shit about Dad.   -The plan was always

we were getting out clean...   -Yeah

Doing Pierce, buying Pierce together.

What the fuck happened?

Shiv, maybe we can keep it, and Pierce, all of us.

Man, you are fucking cocksuckers

Shiv, we're... I'm...

Sor... I mean, we're sorry. We are

We wouldn't have dicked you over

Yeah.

We wanted to keep you clean

Should we like..

Can we do the huggy thing?

Sure.   -Yeah?

Yeah.  -All right. I am sorry.

Sorry.

Cool?

Sorry.

Hello.   -I have a..

What?   -...appointment that I can't reschedule

So... Okay. Sure.

You're in here.   -We all set?

Think so. Investor relations in 20?

Yeah. Thanks

What do you wanna give me?   -I wanna give you..

Douche. What?   -A little preview of tonight's selection.

Hey. Hey.   -  -Hey...

Go on.   -Sorry.

All right. You okay?

I'm fine.

We had... We had this room booked

Okay. Right. No, I'll leave you to it.

I thought the room was... empty for...

You really okay?   -Yeah, fine

You sure?

Yes. I'm just very busy

And...

I have found I am too busy, what with my dad

And so, Sarah has sometimes found me somewhere

so that I can... have a moment to cry

Yeah.   -You're scheduling your grief?

Just... just fuck off. Yeah?

Hey. Come on. Shiv.

Come on.

Come on. It's okay. It's okay

It's okay.

" Sadly, my sons, Kendall and Roman Roy

are too tied up with important company business

to join us at this year's Investment Day.

We're not gonna keep that in?

Let's keep that in.

Does it feel cheesy to alternate

or... or should we do block one, block two?

No, it's fine. It's whatever. It's... Yeah

What do you think on... Thank you

What do you think on Mats son?

If you know, Operation Fruit Loop doesn't fly

Muster a share bloc?

Board, convince he's a value destroyer?

Regulatory shit? Hope the price runs away?

I don't know. Something.

Tell is says he doesn't have juice past 192

Well, something about this all does depress me.

Yeah? And, do you think it's the speech

written specifically for our late father,

or the fact we're planning to warehouse the elderly

and keep them drunk on content while we suck'em dollar dry?

I think it's the'90s pitch

" Personalized longevity programs.

I see them.   -What is that?

Is that something?

Can we see drafts, J?   -Yeah

Give me the double click on longevity

so I can see everything. Infinite brainbox

Yeah.

I can, ask Joy Palmer if the fucking

Kali spit ron director can come on board

and make everything more confusing and loud

Is that... is that now? Joy?   -Yeah. That's now.

All right, sprinkle some sugar.

Yeah. Will do.   -Full confidence. Yeah?

Gotta up our velocity, man.

Yeah. I mean, even she should be able to come up with a mega  -hit

from a couple extra content bill.

Just break the log jam, get the franchise pump pumping

Yeah? Pump it up.   -Pump it. Yeah. Fuck yeah

I'm gonna love-bomb that stuck-up bitch.

All right. Shoot it to the moon, Rome

Will do.   -New space cowboys in town.

Yeah. Who wants to fuck? I'm ready to fuck

Who ready for Fucky wood?

Hello.   -Roman Roy.

'Tis I.   -Hey.

How are you? Good to see you.

We'd all like to offer our sincere condolences

Thank you. That's... That's very nice.

Yes.   -Refused.

I have all the condolences I need.

Tummy full. Shall we?

Well, it just hasn't hit you yet

No. It's...   -You know, I'm sure it will

But you'll be okay. It takes time.

Okay. Well, many, many thanks. Many, many, many, many, many.

You'll be fine.   -Okay

And it's very exciting about the deal

What's he like?

Lukas? Great. Flaky. Really druggy, odd, not focused.

But, yeah. You know. Honestly, few issues.

I'm sure I can fix it, but..

So, I can't stand still. I.. I have thoughts

Well, of course. Everybody does.

What was that?   -A little Groucho Marx for ya

Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Inside cinema.   -Yeah, so I just sort a

wanted to may be just get it out of the way. Kali spitron?

I just wanna know who's getting fired for that shit show.

I mean, I can certainly loop you in, but it's complicated.

Okay.

Shall we just sidebar that? You know, that..

particular situation has lots of big personalities

Big personalities

Yeah, I can't see that happening again.

No, I've been taking it very seriously

Good. Okay. Well... Look, I... I... I'm..

I'm gonna turn on the money hose for you. Okay?

We wanna back you. We just wanna hear

that you're confident that we can the hit machine pump in'

Well, absolutely. Yeah

I mean, there is one thing that we have been concerned about

Okay. Hit me. I'm ready.

Let's do it.

The right ward lean from ATN.

Lots of people are concerned about democratic institutions.

Yeah. Yeah. Got it.

You want me to say more things.

We're getting a lot of questions about A TN's favorable coverage

on Mencken.

I mean, isn't there something you can do

to signal a distance?   -Yeah, yeah. Look.

Mencken's IP. just like anything. Yeah?

I don't like him, you don't like him. What are we gonna do?

But it's all in terms of talent. You know?

The company..

We have values here in this creative community

And I know, I get it. And I... And I love the values.

I mean, it's, an incredibly evolved

ruthlessly segregated city

you built on this geological fault here.

Let's get real.   -Look, we're trying.

I just... I sort of feel like... Yeah, I feel like..

you're not really listening to me?

I'm saying I'm gonna just dump a ton of money on you

and all we want is to get the hit pump pump in'

You understand, right?

Balance between streaming and theatrical.

Franchise creation. International marketing. Yeah?

Yeah, you can trust me. I got it. Very exciting.

All right.

You know...

Joy. I, I get it. I... You're thinking

" The fuck does this guy know about anything?

He's not his dad. He can't do it

Roman's track record is bullshit.

No, I'm sure you are where you are

for very good reason

I could just fire you. So...

That's a funny joke? I could

Look, I... I think...   -I'm not saying I am.

I'm just saying I could.

Although may be I should.   -No.

No, I said it. Now I feel like I gotta commit

Our tent pole is bullshit and out of control,

and you're not gonna fix it, so I'm calling it

I'm sorry. We're done.   -Are..

Yeah, we're... we're...   -Are you

This is... Yeah, I am. What I mean to say is the,

the... the company wishes to terminate your employment

HR will be in touch to start the termination process.

We wish you the best of luck on all your future endeavors.

This is a mistake.

Okay.

Hey, Jade...   -Yes?

Can... can we get.

Let's get Lana and Hugo on analyst double check, who's confirmed

And let's get Raj primed to throw some softballs. Okay?

And I think Shiv can just say

you know, this and this, and... and may be... maybe this

Give that to Roman. Just let'em know. Okay?

Yeah. I can let them know.

And in terms of lighting cues, just so we can brief Kush

and the AV team. What are you thinking

Ken...

Could we build me a Living Plus house?

As in...

Small, plywood, basic brickwork, nothing crazy

I could walk through it.

ATN on here. Face aging on the wall here.

May be clouds appear above the house. What do you think?

We can definitely check with the team. Denny?

It... it's certainly an exciting vision, but..

Don't say no, Denny.

This is for tomorrow?

Hollywood though. Right?

We need a house, practical build.

Here's the rule. Okay? No one can say no.

" Yes, Kendall. Thank you, Kendall

for the cool new rule.

Thank you, Kendall.   -Thank'you, Kendall

Thank you, Kendall.   -For the cool new rule.

Hey!

Good pep talk?

Yeah, good, good, full of joy.

It kind of turned into

Whatever, I'll catch you up in a bit.   -Okay, look

I've been looking through the launch deck

I have a big..

I have a... I have a big thought

It's looking great. Without an investor relation to withhold.

Would you excuse me for a moment? Thank you

Hey

Hi.   -Hey.

Enjoying the investor reception?

Sorry, I don't wanna cramp your style.

No, no, no.

I'm sure you're keen to get amongst it.

" It "?

Yeah, the... the vaginas of the cheerful women

who aren't tall enough to be models

Nah, I'm good. I'm good.

Okay.

So... Who do you like?

Yeah? Can I guess?

Could do.

Is that what you've been doing, going around and just, like

saying things to people? The leggy blondes?

The tan models.   -You know..

Like, leaning in, saying, " Hi. Hey, I'm Tom."

I think, I guess, if I was gonna say something

from the heart, I would say I'm sorry

You're sorry?   -Yeah, I'm sorry

I'm sorry for fucking you up.

You should be so lucky.

You hardly scratched the surface.

I was fucked up long before I met you

What, with TK?

Yeah. Yeah, with TK. The Washington situation.

You were the one after the one.

The actual one, and that's always.

You know, that's hard.

I think I got my chisel in on you.

Hardly a scratch

But you, I mean, I'm the whole story for you.

I just twisted your heart right up

Yeah, I guess.

Mary? Tom, please. I did a number on you

Mary? You didn't have... You didn't have a taste

of the dark meat before you met me.

I'd had my times.

You want to play bitey?

Bitey?   -We never played bitey?

No

Okay, well, you bite me.

I bite you, see who can take it.

Okay, sure.   -Give me your arm.

So, first one to stop, loses.

Bitey.

Bitey. Ready?   -Yeah, I guess

Is that all you got?

Motherfucker

Bitey!

You okay?

Yeah. Tom Wambsgans finally made me feel something

Nice.

So, I've been through the material and I have a pitch

Okay.

Unbelievable growth.

Price rocket.   -Okay

Drive the price, we make the deal impossible

So all you need is unbelievable growth?

Okay, all right, Dr.Sarcasmo. Did we ask you to squeak?

Stand easy there, pitch wall.   -If we can drive above 192

no one thinks Mats son has the juice

Okay, so...   -He has to walk

Chase him out on price?

I think we can get a tech valuation

for a real estate proposition on this

Living Plus?

Well... Can I just say.

I... I think it's hard to make houses seem like tech

cause we've had houses for a while now.

Just, we need to make analysts look at the company differently

I'm telling you, this is the killer app.

Maximize your physical potential

live... well, not... Not forever...

Why not forever?   -Well, sure. If not forever.

live more forever.

Pitch bot, is it dope?

It's kind a dope. Like a robot, please, pitch bot

It's kind of dope.

My God, you're fired.

We can push this to the moon.

But we don't have the numbers, right?

These are not... These are the old numbers.   -We'll have the numbers

We'll have the numbers?   -Yeah.

So then, what... where... where's our go  -to?

I guess the sweet spot would be

right after they get fucking delicious

and just before they get fucking stupid

Right.   -Right?

Greg, go find Jess, and what we talked about,

getting the edit.   -Robot out

Beat it, scrub.

You know, I like it.

I mean, I'm not crazy myself about dying. So

I know, right? It's bullshit

It was kind of not... It was very..

I just, you know.

It wasn't... I just didn't see it coming with Dad

Yeah.   -Yeah

It's very un-Dad.   -Very un-Dad

So I think people would be very intrigued

if there was another way through the whole situation.

You mean life?   -Life

Yeah. Yeah.   -  -Death, yeah.

Yeah, yeah. I mean, you know, get loaded onto a chip and

fired up someone's ass,

float around as a gas, live in a tortoise,

I don't know. There's got to be ways through

Death just feels very "one size fits all.

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Roman.   -Yeah

I want to talk to you.   -Gerri. I want to... Okay

The fuck is that?

I'm on a schedule. So, what is this?

What happened?

With what?   -With Joy?

She's not picking up.

She's got outside counsel?   -Yeah.

What the fuck happened?   -Look, I fired her. So?

Roman, you absolutely can not fire a studio executive

without speaking to Legal and HR

and... and, having someone else present,

in case...   -Right, right, except I can because I did.

What precisely did you say?

Because now we are open to litigation... Who cares?

And ridicule...

and now, we have to think of how to frame an apology

or row back...   -Jesus fucking Christ, I didn't fire her. Okay?

I said that she was fired to her, that's all

The fuck does that mean?

It means she's not going to be on the fucking street. Okay?

We'll kick her up to International,

or she walks and takes a fat fucking producer deal

You can work on the sweep up, okay? Chop-chop.

Joy has a lot of relationships. She has a lot of friends

So do I.   -And you are weak monarch

in a dangerous interregnum.   -No, no.

And I think you need to reconsider

This is something that Dad would have done,

and you know it.   -Well, maybe. But you're not your dad

Okay. Okay.

I mean, you're in a more complicated position, okay?   -No, I'm what's left.

Gerri, here's the fucking thing.

What?   -You hauling me out of things

telling me to reconsider good calls,

and using the F-word freely

it... it feels... it feels disrespectful.

I need you...

to believe that I am as good as my dad

Can you do that?

Say it or believe it?

You don't treat me with sufficient respect,

and that's a problem

Well, maybe I'll fire you, too.

Sure, I'm not on the kill list.   -So?

So, Mats son will be very angry.   -Fuck Mats son, I don't care.

Be serious, you're minding shop

Roman. No, no, no, no. Roman?

Yeah.   -You can not win against the money

The money is gonna wash you away. Your dad knew.

Tech is coming. We are over

Make your accommodation. Okay.   -This is a simple business decision.

You are not good at your job. May be Dad did know.

May be I'm firing you for a list of failures

I choose not to outline right now.

but including a failure to close of f our liabilities

vis-a-vis claims against Way star Cruises

in a timely manner.

That'll play nicely. Let's do that.

I am good at my job.   -Shall we get started

on the paperwork? You wanna do it yourself,

or do you want me to get somebody a bit sharper?

Bye!

You fucking ass hole!

Yeah. I think we can push. Push it, push it.

Hey. This is juicy as fuck, Rome.   -Yeah?

We're gonna work through the night.

Cool.   -Yeah

Hey, and, you okay to show face at the reception?

The party? Sure.   -After the thing?

Okay.   -Because I got the big eye on.

The ball is looking fat, bro.   -Good

I can see everything.   -Good, good, good

So, it's just... I think you should know.

I think we should let Joy go.

Okay. Yeah?   -Yeah. Yeah.

I mean, right now, it's kind of all about the move, so that's.

Yeah, that's... that's... Dude, that's baller for me

Yeah? Great.   -Yeah. yeah. Let's put an end to Joy

Great.   -Death to Joy

Gerri told me that that was a bad move

and I should sort a roll that back

so I, I fired Gerri.

Fuck off. You fired Gerri? Shiv's godmother, Gerri?

Yeah. Yeah, but we may need to roll back on that

I don't know, you may need to smooth over, whatever

Fuck it, bro. Why not? Drop her in the end zone.

I mean, look at you

Who... Who are you gonna fire next?

I mean, fire Frank

fire Karl, fucking eat Greg, and fire me, man.

Yeah, I don't know, it's big.   -You're on fire.

It feels big. It feels maybe it's a bit big.   -No, it's not big. It's not big

It's not too big? Yeah?   -Put on the Dad goggles. Right? It's nothing

Yeah?   -Nothing. " Dynamic Way star duo

shake up their senior leadership team."

Grumble quote, grumble quote, caveat

" Some are saying these two young turks

might just have what it takes to turn things around.'

Nice?

Very nice.

Hey, what do you think about the election party?

Your dad's party? You think maybe I should host?

Who's that? Striking Viking?

Yeah.

Let me ask you one thing

You're all in on Mats son?

Yeah. I guess

I mean, your brothers hate me, and you hate me

and you'll fire me. So, yeah

I don't entirely.

entirely know what to do

Regarding Mats son?

Yeah. Well, you know, we have a connection. So..

You have a connection?

Yeah. What?

What? It's just not, like..

Because you want to suck him off

you think that... That I must want to fuck him?

Think we're all gonna live together in a big old Mats son house.

you know, fucking each other and singing Mats son songs?

Still keeping all your options open, honey?

Yeah? You should be careful with that

Truth bombs from... t from the phony man.

I think... I think I want you. I think I would like this back

Well then, you shouldn't have betrayed me.

Phony.

If I try to say it. If I try to say the truth.

It's that when I met you, all my life..

I've been thinking a little bit about money..

and how to get money, and how to keep money

And you didn't ask me in.

Shiv, you kept me out.

And I always agreed to all the compartments,

but it seemed to me that I was gonna be caught

between you and your dad.

And I really, really, really love my career

and my money.

And, you know, the suits, and my watches, and..

Yeah. Sure, I know.

I like nice things, I do

And if you think that's shallow.

why don't you throw out all your stuff for love.

Throw out your necklaces and your jewels

for a date at a three-star Italian

Yeah? Come and live with me in a trailer park

Yeah? Are you coming?

Well, I'd follow you anywhere for love, Tom Wambsgans.

I'm convinced

that the Living Plus real estate brand

can bring the cruise ship experience to dry land

and provide a significant boost to the earnings

of our parks division.   -Okay, you can... You can stop it. So, that's.

So, what we want him to say... We want him to say

"double the earnings " instead of "a significant boost."

Well, I, I'm not sure

that I can do that.

But I bet you can.

Yeah. I can talk to the sound editor but

you know, without those words, without him saying...

No, yeah. You... you... you can build it from other bits

Well.   -In... in the..

Yeah, I don't know if I can.

Well, yeah, you can. I need you to

Well, I mean it's just that, technically

I don't think that I can do that

No, no. Look... That... that's enough

That's enough. Okay? That just.

Just fuckin' make it happen.

Make it happen. Okay?   -Okay

Or I get in trouble. And I don't wanna get in trouble

I wanna get in the good books

So, you help me get in the good books

Understand, Mr. Snippy-snip?

What if we doubled that?

What is that?

Well, I think you know the specific...   -Can we double it?

You know the specific business better than me,

but on units, if we go optimistic...

Go explosive, Pete.

I guess, the first wave being Florida

Colorado, Arizona, 500.   -Could that be 1,000?

I suppose. Yeah.   -And then the,

five and ten-year projections?

I mean, it needs to be super credible

Pete, it's gotta be credible.

New products and services

machine learning on the marketing

plus repackaging health data to third parties.

Easily, easily grow that.

I...   -Two, three percent per month

What... what does that... what does that do to CAGR?

Does it make it bigger, Pete?

It makes it a lot bigger.   -What? Fifty percent? Per year?

Five years, we 10x revenue? Yeah?   -Can I talk to Karl?

What is the biggest headline number that's credible?

The thing is, numbers aren't just numbers

They're numbers.   -That's you... you're talking gibberish, Pete.

I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm fucking with you. Pete.

If it feels scary.

it's because the potential is scary, Pete

Sure. No, good

Hey, I need you to be comfortable

because the analysts, they're gonna get into us on this

Are you confident? Are you confident, Pete?

I think we can make the argument.   -Dukes up?

We can make the argument. Yeah.   -Yeah. Yeah?

Great! Fuck yeah

Can you get the door?

Hey, Lukas. Hey, Sweedey

Hey!

So... Look, I figured that I should mention

we are gonna be pushing Living Plus

I don't want... I don't like real estate

It's not scalable,

and I don't want the hassle of unwinding.

Is... is there any way you can stop it?

No. No, I can't.

I mean, and like how?

I don't... I don't know. You can turn off the lights

or, bomb threat.

Look, I am being very generous telling you stuff,

because I feel like it's appropriate

given where we're at,

but I'm not about to start dropping stage weights on people's heads.

Look, let me have a think about it.

Okay?   -Okay. Bye.

Okay. Okay. Morning

Great. And then the light that comes through

How we doing?   -Good. The house

In the end, the guys couldn't achieve everything

This won't be just this, will it?

Well, no. We're... we're throwing something over it

We can do it with light

You did the clouds?

Yeah.   -Can I see'em?

Yeah. Yeah. John. Hit it. Hit on the clouds

Okay. Hold the work

Guys, this... That's... That's not the clouds

It's not the clouds at all.

I told you, I saw it in Berlin. It... the..

We... we were in touch with them, but.

Just...

et me think

What do you think, man? It's

It still fits? The words?

The words? The words. Yes.

Where did those fun little numbers.

Where did that come from?

From up here, Rome.   -From... From up there?

Hey. Projections, right?   -Sure.

I'm kidding. No, we have it. We have it. Pete has it.

Yeah?   -It's all good

Yeah. Hockey stick, we're pushing to the moon.

Right, Rome?

Yeah.   -To the moon.

Hey.   -Hello.

What do you think about the words?

Yeah, words are good. Words are okay

Yeah?   -Yeah.

And what about the numbers?

Yeah.

Yeah, I get the idea, but...

you know, those are big numbers.

I'm worried, Rome. He's... He's got that gleam in his eye.

It'll be okay.   -Jesus Christ, Rome.

What?   -This is not good

It's gonna be very fucking messy

You're out of control, he's out of control.   -It's fine

And this is going down. I think, should we just...

Should we pull the plug on today?

It's fine, it's fine. It's a decent play, I think.

Yeah. Sure.   -Yeah.

Made-up numbers and... and, shooting to the moon,

and imaginary clouds.   -Yeah

Dude, come on.   -No, I know. I just...

I think it's... Yeah, it's high risk

but I think, you know, we have to back it

You know he could do anything up there. And then..

you're a part of it.

Like, he has... harebrained schemes

I love him, but he cracks under pressure.

and I think we should protect him

We should stop this.

No, it's okay. Roman's here.

Hey, man. Come on in. Hey!   -Beautiful service

Hey. hey.   -Hi. How are you?

Yeah, good...   -Nice. Cool digs.

Flight jacket.

For the launch.   -For the launch

You wanna run it, should we run it?

I'm not doing the clouds

I decided.   -Well, yeah. Because they weren't clouds

Don't need'em. Don't need'em.

We're just gonna do an acoustic set. Ken and Rome unplugged.

Heads up, I've gone even bigger in Colorado.

Yeah?   -The numbers get crazy good

Yeah. Okay.   -Like, dude.

It's enough to make you lose your faith in capitalism.

Like you could say anything.   -Right. I'll bet

I got... I made you one.

But you should try it on.   -A jacket?

Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's for you

Yeah?   -Yeah

-Yeah, okay.  -Co-pilots. That's the idea. Flight jacket, co-pilots

I got you....

You got the pages?   -Well, in that case,

I should talk a little bit. I just...

What?

What?   -I think that I.

I don't know. May be...

May be, like.

we shouldn't do it?

Or like... may be postpone?

Don't..

Hey, man, it's fucking... It's okay. It's not.

Shit. You know, let's...

Maybe we just... dump it on fucking Ray.

I mean, look, it's his division, and... you know...

but maybe not do the whole..

This... This is the...

This is the... the idea, though.

I know.   -This is the..

Maybe I'm just worried that I can sell it. I don't know.

So, do we pull it?   -You think it's nuts?

No! No. I mean...   -No?

You know, I mean, pitching fuckin' playhouses

and living forever, and then doubling up

the fuckin'numbers.   -It's time. It's time.

It’s big-swing time  -I get it

We have to.   -I know. I know. I know.

I just, maybe... May be I just worry that it's..

Or that, you know, they're your words

You got the words. You got the fucking skills

and I just might, you know..

It's your vision, this whole thing.

and I've sort of been in... You know, I might fuck it.

Man.

I mean, we could also, like, raincheck this

do this some other time, and see if something else comes up.

Yeah.   -Okay. It's about time.

It's time? Great.   -Yep.

It's gonna be great. It is, you're gonna kill it

I read the thing, and I know you,

and this is gonna be, you know.

Good luck. Break... break that leg

Karl wants two

Hey, Karl.   -Yeah. Hi. Just..

Just to say good luck?   -Thanks, man

And, just to get some visibility, if that's okay

I...'Cause I just heard that, more tweaks

have been made in my arena.

It's cool. It is cool.   -Okay, well,

if I could just take a quick, quick peek

Karl, man, it's not a good time.

Then if you could just talk me through it.

Just... No, just so I'm comfortable in my own mind that I got your back

It is all good, Karl. Okay? It's all good.   -What we... we really need.

Now is not a good time.   -Just a sec. Hang on, just..

It's not a good time, Karl.   -Really? Well, listen to me

I took a lot of shit from your dad

because we've been through the mill

But I've been the CFO of major public companies

for over two decades

and I know a thing or two about a thing or two

And if you fuck up his deal

or you try to stand up numbers that I am not comfortable with

I swear to God...   -Hey, hey, hey

Hey. Easy. Easy. CEO. CFO

What? You gonna fire your chief financial officer a week in?

Your dad just gone?

You'd be fucking toast

You have my dick in your hand, Ken

But I've got yours in mine. So let's get real.

If you say anything that I don't like up there

or make me look foolish

I'll fucking squeal

Good luck. Good luck to you, buddy

we'll be there every step of the way

Okay.

It says here on my words that, " I'm glad to be here."

And, you know, I... I... I kinda am

so, thanks, prompter. Thanks

Don't talk to the teleprompter, amateur

Why is that bad?   -You don't do that.

Last time I was up at something like this

I was disrupting our annual meeting

And, now I'm CEO. Co-CEO

And, you know, I... I just want to say thank you.

I want to thank the whole Way star family

who have offered us so much love and support

over these last few tough days

So, yeah, we're so grateful. Thank you

It means a lot. It means a lot. Isn't that right, Dad?

My God. My fucking God

No way.   -I mean, this is new, this is all new.

We, we had our differences, yeah

But it is good to see you

Let's, get on with it, shall we?

Yeah, for sure... Sure thing. Sure..

Strangest double act ever.

I'll say.   -He never changes

Fucking amateur hour. Wake me up when it's over

I don't know if I can... I can watch this

She said while watching the fuck out of it

and getting turned on. I can hear how wet you are. It's gross

I mean, Jesus, Ken, keep it fucking light

Hey, you don't even have to worry about your speech

You just go on and mop up all the blood

Okay, so listen.

Today, I wanna share with you an extraordinary product

that my father was working on to the very end

It's an exciting new vision we call Living Plus

Yeah. Yeah. Living Plus!

Look, the world's tough

It's tough. It's getting tougher

What our incredible new product offers is a sanctuary

It's a place where it doesn't fee

you or your mom or dad are surviving life

It's somewhere you're really living

Living Plus.

Now, rebranded " Kendall Goes Woo-Woo

If I cringe any harder, I might become a fossil

Our brand-turbo ed Living Plus real estate communities

are going to guarantee three absolute essentials

One, total peace of mind

Discreet community protection and enhanced home monitoring

You'll have your keys but, yeah, you won't need'em.

Crime-free, hassle-free, and respectful

Two, fun.

This is good. Th... Is that you?

Is that yours? Very good.

Fun is what we're all about at Way star.

You know, by a lot of-metrics, the leading entertainment brand

in the world, So...

hyper local news, movie-themed events

advance screenings, ATN debate and discussions

multimedia events from cooking to premium access sports

We're talking integrated, everyday

character IP life enhancement

Maybe a director will swing by with a rough cut

Stars certainly will

Movies, shows, rides, experiences to enjoy at home

or with the family, who will not want to stop visiting

We can even tell them you're out if you need a break

We think... We think that security

plus entertainment is a pretty unbeatable offer. Right?

Well, one more thing

How about I told you it was all going to last forever?

Okay. Now we're leaving planet Earth.

Glad you're not strapped in?

Well, I can't, I can't. Not quite yet.

We're not there yet

But our central extraordinary offer

is health and happiness.

Because here's what makes this amazing new product

almost irresistible

Our incredible links with tech and pharmaceutical companies

which mean privileged access to life enhancement

and extension therapies that, right now

are the preserve of tech billionaires

But we're gonna deliver them at home, at scale

targeted and supported.

Hi.   -I don't like it.

Yeah.   -Can you stop it?

What? You don't wanna make prison camps for grannies?

So, what's the game?

Yeah, I mean, he's riding the bullshit unicycle.

but maybe someone could put a stick in the spokes?

Do we have anything behind me?

When I go on?   -I think nothing behind you.

The screen wilI just be black

But that's good 'cause then it's all about you.

Yeah.

We can get a light on you

Well, I would assume... I would hope I'm being spot lit

You know, my dad, he'd been around a little bit

would you say?

He... he... he was conservative on these matters

And in terms of earnings growth, he has this to say..

I'm convinced that the Living Plus real estate brand

can bring the cruise ship experience to dry land

and double the earnings of our parks division.

I couldn't be more excited

Double the earnings

Okay. That's not fucking cool.

Well...   -That's really well edited.

Can we really do it?

Are people who subscribe to Living Plus support

really gonna live ten, 20, 30, 40, 50 years more?

Is it worth it?

Living Plus is going to be a premium product.

Is it worth it?

Well, if you asked me, would I take an extra year,

right now, with my dad? Say the unsaid?

That would be priceless.

Yeah.

I miss you, Dad. I love you, Dad.

General buzz is...   -What? How is it?

Really good.   -Yeah?

People are liking it.   -Yeah.

They're likin'it.

Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!   -What?

" Do derick macht frei.'

That's a very nasty joke, right?   -Shit

Yeah. That's, what, a... It's a Holocaust joke

Look who it's from.   -From our acquirer, so we might need to strategize

Pull the Q and A. Can we let him know?

Can we let Kendall know?   -Fuck

We should try.   -Because he's about to base jump into a buzzsaw

Right, right.  Are... are you backstage?

This is kinda good for you, 'cause your presentation,

not great, and so now no one will be watching.

Detailed financials I will leave to Karl Muller,

our legendary CFO, there he is. Round of applause

Hi. Thank you.

But... but, any questions with a broader overview?

Okay, yeah, Raj

Good to see you guys

Hi. Congratulations on a great presentation

I just wanna know how you feel about Lukas Mats son's response?

His tweet right now?

Sorry. I'm... I'm... I'm catching up.

Well, he's, tweet ed the words

" Do derick macht frei.

Which is from the Naz...   -Yeah. I know what it's from

Give me a sec.

Okay.   -What's your response?

Well, I'm not gonna fave it.

Everybody knows here, you guys all know

we're looking at a deal with Lukas.

And, you know, I have so much time and respect for what he's built

Now, personally, I wouldn't have said that

And, apologies, sincere apologies for any offense caused

You know, he's...

He's very European....

And... and... and... if and

If and when we complete the deal

and he gets into the incredible opportunity this product presents

I think he'll be tweeting something different.

Maybe you're giving this too much attention than it deserves?

I know what I'm doing.   -Just... back off. Yeah?

What he's gonna do next, Mats son?

Well, that's why... Mats son? No

Tweet. Tweeting

He is... Right. No, no, he's handling himself very well.

Yeah.

He's smart, but we don't always come across as we intend

on social media

And one of the things about Living Plus, actually

is, that we see it going beyond

You know, it's kind of like social media

but it's better. You know, it's... it's..

It's physical social media in the real world

I... I think people are hungry for that connection.

I know I am.

Any... any more questions, any more? No?

They're... They're telling me that's my time.

Listen, it's been so fun sharing this with you

It's been so fun.

How am I supposed to follow this?

He's just promised them eternal life

Thank you, guys

Worked out. Yeah, walking on the moon.

I wanna make

what I think is a fairly historic announcement

I'm convinced that Roman Roy has a micro dick

and always gets it wrong

I wanna make what I think is a fairly historic announcement.

I'm convinced that Roman Roy

has a micro dick and always gets it wrong.

I wanna make what I think is a fairly historic announcement.

I'm convinced that Roman Roy

has a micro dick and always gets it wrong.

I wanna make what I think is a fairly historic announcement.

I think, if we're thinking of hosting.

I can't... I can't get into it. Any of our shit, yeah.?

I think it has to be, if this is okay with you

strictly party and strategy

Strictly. Entirely

I can't help it if I find strategy sexy, though.

I do. I really do.
