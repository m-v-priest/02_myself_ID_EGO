This is an episode about experiencing virtual reality. What is virtual reality? We'll find out in this episode. Let's get started.
[start of dialogue]
Tatiana: Why are you wearing those funny goggles?
Moustafa: I’m trying out a new kind of virtual reality.
Tatiana: You mean like flight simulators?
Moustafa: This is much more sophisticated. This system creates a complete sensory experience. I can see, hear, feel, and nearly taste this 3-D simulation.
Tatiana: I don’t see how it can do that.
Moustafa: With the help of these goggles and headphones, this computer program recreates what it’s like to actually be in a particular place, at a particular time. It even allows me to interact with different people and things.
Tatiana: I can see how that would be useful for gaming, but...
Moustafa: It’s not only for gaming. It’s useful for a host of other things, including relaxation. For instance, right now I’m experiencing what it’s like to be outdoors with the sun shining and the birds chirping.
Tatiana: If you open the door, you’ll see that the sun is shining and the birds are chirping.
Moustafa: Yes, but with virtual reality, I may never have to get out of this chair again. Now isn’t that progress?
[end of dialogue]
Tatiana asks Moustafa, “Why are you wearing those funny goggles?” The word “funny” here means odd, strange, or unusual. We also use the word “funny,” when something makes us laugh. But here, it's used to mean weird, or strange. “Goggles” (goggles) are things that you wear over your eyes like eyeglasses to protect them. The difference between regular eyeglasses and goggles is that goggles have protection on the side so that your eyes are completely protected or surrounded by the glass or usually, it's plastic that goggles are made out of. Sometimes, there's a combination of rubber and plastic for goggles.
Moustafa says, “I'm trying out a new kind of virtual reality.” “To try out” is a two-word phrasal verb that here means “to test something,” “to do something for the first time,” especially when you are trying to determine whether you like it or not and or whether you want to buy it or not. “To try out” can also mean to try to become a member of a team. That use of the phrasal verb is more common in schools. You can “try out” for the basketball team. You can try to become a member of the basketball team. But here, “to try out” means to test something. “Virtual reality” is a computer-made or computer-generated experience. Usually, it involves you wearing a special device that look like goggles that you put on your head, and it seems as though you are in a different place, or experiencing something that is not real. That's the meaning of the word “virtual” (virtual) in this phrase or term.
Tatiana says, “You mean like flight simulators?” A “flight (flight) simulator (simulator)” is a machine that is used to teach people how to fly an airplane. You're not actually in the airplane, but you're in a special machine that makes it seem as if you were in an airplane. “Flight simulators,” I guess, are a kind of virtual reality, but the virtual reality that people talk about nowadays usually involves something more sophisticated and often with just something over your eyes, or perhaps something in your ears, and over your eyes. Moustafa says, “This is much more sophisticated.” The word “sophisticated” (sophisticated) means here “advanced,” “more complex,” with more technology. He says, “This system creates a complete sensory experience.” The word “sensory” (sensory) relates to the five senses – taste, touch, smell, sight, and sound. Those are called the “five senses” (senses). Then, of course, there is the “sixth sense,” which is talking to dead people. You have to see the movie to understand what I mean by that.
Moustafa continues, “I can see, hear, feel, and nearly taste this 3-D simulation.” Well, I doubt it can feel anything although it's possible. A “3-D simulation” is a “three-dimensional” – “three-dimensional” refers to height, length, and width. Of course, it only seems as if it were 3-D. The real world is 3-D. But when you watch a movie, even a movie with virtual reality goggles, it isn't actually in three dimensions. It just seems as if it were. A “simulation” is a situation where you’re making something seem as if it were real even though it isn't.
Tatiana is confused. She says, “I don't see how it can do that.” Moustafa replies, “With the help of these goggles and headphones, this computer program recreates what it's like to actually be in a particular place at a particular time.” “Headphones” are things you put over your ears in order to hear music or some other sound that has been recorded. The verb “to recreate” (recreate) means to copy how something happened or how something was done, to give someone a similar experience. What Moustafa is saying here is that there is a computer program that allows you to recreate what it's like to be in a particular place and a particular time. Once again it's really like watching a movie that makes it seem as though you are there in the action. And that's what a 3-D movie tries to do.
Moustafa continues. “It even allows me to interact with different people and things.” “To interact” means to talk to or to communicate with another person. Tatiana says, “I can see how that would be useful for gaming, but…” “Gaming” (gaming) means playing video games, something that is very popular nowadays among many people but not me. I grew up in the late 70s, early 80s and video games were just getting started at that time and I never really got that interested in them but I know they are very popular among millions of people, just not me. Well, Tatiana thinks this virtual reality machine would be useful for gaming but she doesn't seem to think it would be useful for anything else. Moustafa disagrees, “It's not only for gaming,” he says. “It's useful for a host of other things including relaxation.” A “host (host) of something” is a large number of something. Moustafa is saying that virtual reality goggles can be used for many different things, including “relaxation” – the act of becoming calm. “For instance,” Moustafa says, “right now,” meaning at this time, “I'm experiencing what it's like to be outdoors with the sun shining and the birds chirping.”
“To be outdoors” (outdoors) means to be outside, not in a house or a building. The sun “shines” (shines) from the sky. “To shine” means for a light to be produced. The sound that birds make is sometimes described using the verb “to chirp” (chirp). We talk about birds “chirping.” In fact there's a bird chirping outside of my window right now. So, Moustafa is saying that he can experience things such as being outside in the sunshine with the birds chirping. Tatiana says, “If you open the door, you'll see that the sun is shining and the birds are chirping,” meaning in the real world.
Moustafa says, “Yes, but with a virtual reality I may never have to get out of this chair again.” He's saying that he will never have to get out of his chair to stand up and leave his house. He says, “Now, isn't that progress?” “Progress” (progress) is an improvement over time, often used when we're talking about technology, although I'm not sure if everything that technology has brought us has resulted in progress.
Now let's listen to the dialogue this time at a normal speed.

Current Uses of Virtual Reality
For many people, “virtual reality” is simply a “gaming platform” (a technology used to play video games), but others are finding more “practical” (useful) “applications” (uses) for the technology. This is especially true in medicine.
For example, virtual reality is being used to train “surgeons” to perform “delicate” (requiring careful, small movements) operations by allowing them to practice “techniques” (ways of doing things) in a virtual reality environment before they ever work on a real patient.
In other medical “settings” (environments), researchers have found that virtual reality can help “amputees” (people who have had an arm or leg cut off) “overcome” (no longer suffer from) “phantom pain” (feelings of pain in a body part that is no longer part of one’s body). Apparently, patients who report phantom pain can use virtual reality to “see” the missing limb and “control” its movement, which reduces or “eliminates” (gets rid of) the pain. Medical care providers have also begun using virtual reality to “distract” (divert attention; help someone avoid thinking about something) patients during painful operations or treatments.
“Returning soldiers” (people who fought in a war and are now back and no longer fighting) who suffer from “post-traumatic stress syndrome” (intense, frightening, and stressful feelings related to one’s past experiences) can use virtual reality with “supervision” (with another person monitoring and controlling the technology) to “relive” (experience again) their experiences during the war and learn to control their reaction to those memories and feelings.
Similarly, teachers are using virtual reality to help children with “autism” (a disorder that makes it difficult for people to control their emotions and interact with others) improve their ability to interact with others and “express” (show and share) their “emotions” (feelings).
