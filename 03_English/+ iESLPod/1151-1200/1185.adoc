This episode is a dialogue between Harry and Christina about people who try to bring things or bring people into another country illegally. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Christina: What is the holdup? There are cars backed up for half a mile.
Harry: I bet the Border Patrol is looking for smugglers.
Christina: Do you really think so? I wonder if there could be a drug mule in one of these cars carrying illegal drugs.
Harry: It might be drugs, but it could be any kind of contraband. I’ve heard that there’s a problem with gunrunning and other kinds of arms trafficking across these borders.
Christina: Maybe they’re looking for people trying to sneak into this country without permission.
Harry: Or they could be looking for people trying to import exotic species without permission.
Christina: What kinds of exotic species?
Harry: Plants and animals that aren’t allowed to be brought into this country, at least not without quarantine.
Christina: Plants? You mean like these herb plants I bought?
Harry: I doubt if they’re prohibited. Wait, you can’t leave the car!
Christina: What if this is contraband and they catch me with it?
Harry: They’ll confiscate it and send us on our way.
Christina: Are you sure?
Harry: Sure, I’m sure. They’d be much more interested in the bats I’m smuggling in my pants anyway.
Christina: What?!
[end of dialogue]
Christina says to Harry, “What is the holdup? There are cars backed up for half a mile.” A “holdup” (holdup) is a source of delay, something that slows you down, something that puts you behind schedule. “There’s a holdup in the front of the line because someone is having a problem with his credit card.” So the line isn’t moving. Nothing is going forward. A “holdup” is a reason for something that isn’t happening that should be happening.
I should mention, there’s a very different meaning of “holdup,” which is when people go into a store or a bank and try to get the money from the store or bank with a gun or some other sort of weapon. That is, if someone tries to steal money by going into the business, usually with some sort of weapon. It doesn’t even have to be a business. It could be a car or somewhere else. Here, we’re just talking about a delay.
Christina says, “There are cars backed up for half a mile.” “To be backed (backed) up” means that you have a lot of cars that are stopped or moving very slowly instead of going at the normal speed on that particular road or freeway. There are backed-up cars on the freeways of Los Angeles every day of the week. Harry says, “I bet the Border Patrol is looking for smugglers.”
Now we understand that Christina and Harry appear to be entering into another country. Maybe they went to Canada and are returning to the United States. Maybe they went to Mexico and are returning to the United States. The “border” (border) is the line that divides two countries. A “patrol” (patrol) is a group of police officers, soldiers, or government officials who are usually there to prevent crime or to do some sort of inspection. In the U.S., the Border Patrol is responsible for preventing people and things from coming into the United States illegally.
If you drive from Canada or Mexico into the United States, you have to stop at the Border Patrol on the border or right inside of the United States, and you will be asked a bunch of questions and they may look inside of your car. This happened to me several times as I came back from Mexico. The Border Patrol is sometimes looking for “smugglers” (smugglers). A “smuggler” is a person who tries to bring things or bring people illegally into another country.
Christina says, “Do you really think so? I wonder if there could be a drug mule in one of these cars carrying illegal drugs.” A “drug mule” (mule) is a person who carries illegal drugs from one place to another usually by hiding those drugs somewhere on or even in his body. We won’t talk about the places where the drugs may be hidden. “Illegal drugs” are drugs that are against the law – chemical substances whose sale and or use is against the law. Examples would be heroin or cocaine in the United States.
Harry says, “It might be drugs, but it could be any kind of contraband.” “Contraband” (contraband) is anything that is brought into a country illegally. It could be drugs. It could be guns. It could even be electronics or certain kinds of food or cigarettes – anything that is illegal to bring into another country. Harry continues, “I’ve heard that there’s a problem with gunrunning and other kinds of arms trafficking across these borders.”
“Gunrunning” (gunrunning) is bringing guns and other weapons into a country illegally. “Arms” (arms) refers to guns and other weapons. “Trafficking” (trafficking) is buying and selling things that are illegal to buy and sell. So “arms trafficking” would be illegally buying and selling guns and other weapons. Sometimes we, sadly, talk about “human trafficking” – buying and selling of human beings. Such is the world we live in.
Christina says, “Maybe they’re looking for people trying to sneak into this country without permission.” “To sneak (sneak) into” means to go into somewhere without being seen or observed, usually because you don’t have permission to go into that place. But it could just be to go into a place unobserved. Your teenage son may sneak into his room after midnight not wanting you to know that he didn’t get home by the time you told him to be home. In this case, we’re talking about people sneaking into a country – going into a country without permission and without being seen.
Harry says, “Or they could be looking for people trying to import exotic species without permission.” “To import” (import) means to bring something into another country, usually to sell it in that country. “Species” (species) refers to a kind of plant or animal. “Exotic (exotic) species” refers to species that are not normally found in a given area or a given country. They’re from another part of the world or another country. Christina then asks, “What kinds of exotic species?” Harry says, “Plants and animals that aren’t allowed to be brought into this country, at least not without quarantine.”
That’s not a very good definition by Harry of exotic species. There are plants and animals that you’re not allowed to bring into a country that are not exotic, meaning that are found normally in that country, but for a variety of reasons you’re not allowed to bring them in. This, by the way, is also sometimes the case when you go from state to state in the United States. Normally when you go from one state to another, there is no person there checking to see if you have certain items that you are bringing into that state, but there are exceptions to that.
Here in California, if you drive into the state of California, you will be stopped by a California officer, a government official, who will ask if you are bringing in certain kinds of plants or fruits. Because California has a large agriculture industry – that is, it grows a lot of food – it has to be careful that you’re not bringing in certain diseases with your plants that would affect the plants here in California. Hawaii also has a similar system where they may check to make sure you’re not bringing in certain kinds of fruit or plants into the state of Hawaii when you arrive at the airport.
Harry also mentions animals coming into the country that cannot be brought in “without quarantine” (quarantine). Certain animals can be brought into a country if they are allowed to spend time separated from other animals to make sure that they don’t have any illnesses or diseases. Christina says, “Plants? You mean like these herb plants I bought?” “Herbs” are basically plants whose leaves are used to season or flavor food – things like parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme – just like the song. You remember? “Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.” Simon and Garfunkel, people. Look it up on YouTube.
Anyway, Harry says, “I doubt if they’re prohibited.” If something is “prohibited” (prohibited), it is not allowed. It is forbidden. Harry then says to Christina, “Wait, you can’t leave the car!” Apparently Christina starts to get out of the car, probably to get rid of her herb plants that she thinks are prohibited. Christina says, “What if this,” meaning her herbs, “is contraband and they catch me with it?” meaning they find her with it.
Harry says, “They’ll confiscate it and send us on our way.” “To confiscate” (confiscate) is to take something from another person because you have the legal right to do so. A teacher may confiscate a student’s cell phone if he’s using the cell phone in class against the rules of the school. The police may confiscate illegal guns or drugs if they find you with them. “To send someone on his way” means to simply let someone leave without doing anything to them, without stopping them – to release someone whom you could have kept but decided not to.
In this case, Harry is saying that the people at the border – who in this case would be the customs officials, I think – would confiscate or take the illegal items but would not arrest them. They would let the people go – in this case, let Christina go. Christina says, “Are you sure?” Harry says, “Sure, I’m sure,” meaning yes, I’m sure. The officials, Harry says, would be much more interested in the bats he is smuggling in his pants.
A “bat” (bat) is a small flying mammal – kind of like a mouse with wings that flies at night. You know Batman? Well, Batman is based on the animal called a “bat.” And apparently Harry has bats in his pants, which sounds very painful, that he is trying to bring illegally into the country. He’s trying to smuggle them into the country. Christina apparently didn’t know that and is quite surprised at the end of the dialogue, as are all of us.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

What Else Does It Mean?
to sneak into
The phrase “to sneak into,” in this podcast, means to enter a place unseen, without being detected or observed: “The students snuck into the teacher’s office and looked for the answers to the exam.” The phrase “to sneak (something) past (someone)” means to hide something and move it past another person unnoticed: “How did you sneak that bottle of liquor past the security guards?” The phrase “to sneak up on (someone)” means to approach someone quietly so that the person does not hear or see it: “Don’t sneak up on me like that! You scared me!” Finally, the phrase “to sneak (something) from (someone)” means to steal a small item: “Did you ever sneak a few dollars from your sister’s purse?”
bat
In this podcast, a “bat” is a small, flying mammal, like a mouse with wings, that flies at night: “For Halloween, many people decorate their homes with images of bats and spiders.” In baseball, a “bat” is the wooden stick used to hit the ball: “Always make sure that you have enough room around you before swinging a bat, or you might hit someone in the head.” The phrase “to do (something) right off the bat” means to do something right away or immediately: “When making business small talk, it’s rude to start talking about work right off the bat.

Culture Note
Regulations Against Invasive Species
The National Invasive Species Act “prevents” (does not allow) “invasive species” from entering “U.S. waters” (waterways owned by the United States) by attaching to “ships” (large boats). “Invasive species” (species from elsewhere) are plants and animals that are not from a particular area, but have been brought there and “thrive” (live well and reproduce quickly), killing “native species” (species from that area; plants and animals that are originally from a particular area). For example, “mussels” (small sea animals in dark shells similar to clams) are often found in ships’ “ballast water” (water that ships carry for extra weight when they are not carrying very much), and when that ballast water is emptied in a different “port” (a place where ships rest next to land), the mussels become an invasive species.
The Alien Species Prevention and Enforcement Act “prohibits” (bans; does not allow) mailing certain plants and animals, specifically invasive species, through the mail. This is an effort to minimize the movement of invasive species in order to “protect” (help survive) native species.
There are several other laws against “particular” (specific) invasive species. For example, the Brown Tree Snake Control and Eradication Act covers how invasive brown tree snakes should be “dealt with” (handled) on the Island of Guam, a U.S. territory, and “takes measures” (does things) to prevent the brown tree snake from “spreading” (expanding its territory) to other areas.
The Nutria Eradication and Control Act provides funding to help the states of Maryland and Louisiana to control or “eradicate” (get rid of; kill) “nutria” (rodents that live in the water, similar to a river otter) and “restore” (improve something to return it to its former condition) “marshes” (swamp; very wet land) that have been damaged by invasive nutria
