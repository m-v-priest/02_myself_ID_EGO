This episode is a dialogue between Suzanna and Kenji about staying in a hotel that doesn’t cost very much. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Suzanna: Remind me why we’re staying in this fleabag motel in the seedy part of town?
Kenji: We agreed that we would skimp on the accommodations so we could spend more money on activities and eating out. Remember?
Suzanna: I remember, but I didn’t bargain for someplace as run-down as this. Look at the peeling wallpaper and moldy bathroom.
Kenji: It’s pretty bad, isn’t it? Look on the bright side. At least it’s not rat-infested.
Suzanna: That’s small comfort. Well, I think I’ll take a short nap before we go out for dinner. Uh!
Kenji: What’s the matter?
Suzanna: This comforter is filthy. I doubt housekeeping has changed it in months!
Kenji: Let’s get out of here and go get a drink. That should cheer us up.
Suzanna: Good idea. If I have more than one, maybe I won’t care so much where we’re staying.
Kenji: Given the state of this room, we might need an entire pitcher!
[end of dialogue]
Suzanna begins our dialogue by asking Kenji, “Remind me why we’re staying in this fleabag motel in the seedy part of town?” When someone begins a question with “Remind me why” or “Remind me,” usually the person is not very happy with the situation, or perhaps confused about something – something he doesn’t understand. For example, if you go to a movie and it’s a really bad movie, a movie recommended by your friend, you may say to your friend, “Remind me why we’re watching this stupid movie?” You’re criticizing, of course, your friend’s choice.
That’s what Suzanna is doing here. She’s in effect criticizing Kenji for having them stay in this “fleabag motel.” A “motel” (motel) is like a hotel but it’s usually smaller and less expensive. The “m,” I believe, originally comes from “motor,” meaning it was a hotel that was designed for people who were and are traveling by car. Usually a motel has doors that face out or that look out onto the parking lot where the cars are.
The term “fleabag” (fleabag) describes a hotel or perhaps another temporary housing place that is dirty, old, and usually falling apart, often with not very clean living conditions. The rooms aren’t clean. The hotel itself isn’t very clean. The word “fleabag” comes from “flea” (flea). A flea is a small animal that you usually associate with dogs, for example, or other small animals. Technically, a “flea” is a small insect that feeds off of the blood of another animal. If your dog has fleas, your dog will often scratch at the fleas or the flea bites.
“Fleabag,” then, would describe a very dirty, not very nice hotel or motel. Suzanne is wondering why they are staying “in this fleabag motel in the seedy (seedy) part of town.” The word “seedy” refers to an area, perhaps even a person who is somewhat suspicious, possibly even criminal. It could also describe a place that is dirty or disgusting or unsafe. If you say, “That’s a seedy character,” you mean that’s a person whom you can’t really trust, a person who might even be a criminal.
To describe a hotel as “seedy” would usually indicate that it’s not a very clean hotel, possibly even a hotel that is used for criminal activity, including prostitution. Kenji says, “We agreed that we would skimp on the accommodations so we could spend more money on activities and eating out. Remember?” “To skimp (skimp) on” something is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to spend a very small amount on something – much less than most people would normally spend – in order to save money, although you could also skimp on something because you don’t want very much of it.
There’s an adjective “skimpy” (skimpy) which describes someone who isn’t wearing very much clothing. If a woman is wearing a “skimpy outfit” (outfit), she’s not wearing very much clothing. A “bikini,” for example, might be described as being skimpy. But here, the phrasal verb “to skimp on” means not spending very much money. Kenji says that he and Suzanna agreed they would not spend very much money on accommodations. “Accommodations” (accommodations) refers to a place where you stay when you are traveling, such as a hotel.
Another word for “accommodations” is “lodging” (lodging). Although, you don’t hear that word as much anymore unless you’re talking about your expenses for your company. If you travel, your company might ask you to give them receipts for your lodging, for your accommodations, basically for your hotel room. Kenji says the agreement that he and Suzanna had was “to skimp on accommodations” so they could spend more money on “eating out” – that is, on eating in a restaurant.
Suzanna says she remembers this, “But,” she says, “I didn’t bargain for someplace as run-down as this.” If someone says, “I didn’t bargain (bargain) for “something, she means she didn’t anticipate or intend to do something. Usually when you say, “I didn’t bargain for this,” you mean you are surprised in a negative way because you didn’t expect this or you didn’t think you agreed to do this.
“To be run-down” means to be in very poor condition – to be very old, to be perhaps falling apart. You could describe a building as being “run-down.” “This apartment building is run-down.” It’s not taken care of very well. There are things that are broken. It might be a little dirty. That would all be part of this description of being “run-down.”
Suzanna says, “Look at the peeling wallpaper and moldy bathroom.” “Wallpaper” is paper, that usually has a certain color or decoration, that you put up on a wall instead of painting it. That’s why the term “wallpaper” makes so much sense. It’s paper that you put on the wall. If wallpaper isn’t put down properly, or if it’s very old, it will start to “peel” (peel). The verb “to peel” here means for the wallpaper to begin to come off the wall, especially from the top of the wall.
“To peel” can also mean to remove the outer layer of something. You could peel a potato. You could take the outer layer, what we would call the “skin” (skin) of the potato, off. So, “peeling wallpaper” is wallpaper that is falling off. A “moldy (moldy) bathroom” is one in which there is fungus – something that is caused usually by moisture. You don’t want mold in your bathroom. It can cause a lot of problems, including health problems.
Kenji said, “It’s pretty bad isn’t it,” meaning this motel is pretty bad. “Look on the bright side,” he says. This expression “to look on the bright (bright) side” is used when you are asking someone to find something good or positive in a bad situation. It’s another way of saying “be optimistic,” “be positive,” “look for the good things here.” He says, “At least it’s not rat-infested.”
The positive thing that Kenji points out about this motel is that it doesn’t have rats – small little animals that you don’t really want to see in your house or hotel room. The term “rat-infested” (infested) just means full of rats, or lots of rats. Suzanna says, “That’s small comfort,” meaning it’s a good thing but not very much.
“Well,” she says, “I think I’ll take a short nap” – a short time to sleep – “before we go out for dinner.” “Uh!” she says. Kenji says, “What’s the matter?” meaning what’s wrong. Suzanna says, “This comforter is filthy.” A “comforter” (comforter) is a thick, warm blanket that you put on a bed. If something is “filthy” (filthy) it’s very dirty, it’s very unclean.
Suzanna continues, “I doubt housekeeping has changed it in months!” In a hotel or a motel, there usually is a group of people who go around cleaning the rooms, usually every day. That group of people is called, collectively, “housekeeping” (housekeeping). These are the people – I’ll have to say, in most hotels in the United States, usually women – who go around and clean the rooms or who are supposed to clean the rooms. Suzanne is complaining that the comforter probably has not been “changed” or cleaned in many months.
Kenji says, “Let’s get out of here and go get a drink,” meaning an alcoholic drink. “That should cheer us up,” he says. “To cheer someone up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to make you happy. Suzanna says, “Good idea,” meaning yes, that is a good idea. “If I have more than one,” meaning more than one drink, “maybe I won’t care so much where we’re staying.”
Kenji says, “Given the state of this room, we might need an entire pitcher.” “Given” here means considering or in reference to. “The state of this room” refers to the condition of this room. Kenji is saying, then, that because of how bad this room is, “we might need an entire pitcher” (pitcher). A “pitcher” is a large container. Here Kenji is referring to a large pitcher of beer, I’m guessing.
Kenji is saying that because the room is in such bad condition, he and Suzanna might need to drink a whole pitcher of beer in order to feel better, in order to be cheered up enough so that they can continue staying in this fleabag motel.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
[start of dialogue]
Suzanna: Remind me why we’re staying in this fleabag motel in the seedy part of town?
Kenji: We agreed that we would skimp on the accommodations so we could spend more money on activities and eating out. Remember?
Suzanna: I remember, but I didn’t bargain for someplace as run-down as this. Look at the peeling wallpaper and moldy bathroom.
Kenji: It’s pretty bad, isn’t it? Look on the bright side. At least it’s not rat-infested.
Suzanna: That’s small comfort. Well, I think I’ll take a short nap before we go out for dinner. Uh!
Kenji: What’s the matter?
Suzanna: This comforter is filthy. I doubt housekeeping has changed it in months!
Kenji: Let’s get out of here and go get a drink. That should cheer us up.
Suzanna: Good idea. If I have more than one, maybe I won’t care so much where we’re staying.
Kenji: Given the state of this room, we might need an entire pitcher!

What Else Does It Mean?
run-down
The phrase “run-down,” in this podcast, means very old, not well maintained, and falling apart: “The university offers good classes with well-respected professors, but the facilities are run-down, so the students don’t enjoy attending their classes here.” A person who is “run-down” is very tired and has not been taking care of himself or herself: “Sheila is really run down after several months of working more than 80 hours each week.” To give someone the “rundown on (something)” means to provide a summary or other basic information about something, without many details: “Please give us the rundown on your sales strategy.” Finally, the phrase “to run (someone) down” means to drive one’s car into another person to hurt or kill that person: “The police are trying to figure out who ran down the old woman while she was crossing the street.”

Culture Note
Chateau Marmont Hotel
The Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles, California is “infamous” (famous for being bad) for the bad behavior of its guests. It was built in 1929 to look like a French “chateau” (a large house or castle in France), and “promoted” (advertised) as the city’s “finest” (fanciest and best) and most “exclusive” (available to only a small number of people) “residential” (for people to live in) apartment building. However, during the “Great Depression” (a period of time with a very poor economy; see English Café 327), “tenants” (people who rent a home or room) weren’t able to pay their rent on time, so the owner, Fred Horowitz, sold the building to a man named Albert Smith. Mr. Smith “converted” (changed the building’s purpose) the building into a hotel.
The hotel quickly became popular with “celebrities” (people who are famous, especially for acting, music, or sports) and “gained a reputation for” (became known for) being the place to go to “misbehave” (to behave badly; to break the rules).
“Stories abound” (there are many stories) about celebrities engaged in sexual “improprieties” (behaviors and actions that violate society’s standards) and drug use, as well as “heavy” (intense; a large amount of) partying. Actor James Dean once jumped out of a window at the hotel, and Judy Garland sang next to a piano in the “lobby” (the entrance and main gathering area in a hotel). Led Zepplin, The Doors, and other famous rock-and-roll musicians have misbehaved there as well. And, more recently, celebrities Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan were asked to leave due to their bad behavior.
