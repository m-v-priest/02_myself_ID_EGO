This episode is called “Making Funeral and Burial Arrangements.” Reiko and Lucas are having a conversation about what will happen when they die – what they want done with their body after they die. So, we’ll have vocabulary related to death. On that happy note, let’s get started!
[start of dialogue]
Reiko: When I die, I want a big funeral. The more mourners the better!
Lucas: Not me. I’m just the opposite. I don’t want any kind of funeral or wake. I just want to be cremated and have my ashes scattered.
Reiko: What? You don’t want to be buried in a beautiful casket with a big headstone? Better yet, how about being interred in a mausoleum?
Lucas: You’ve got to be kidding me! Why would I all want all of that hoopla? I’m dead. What difference would it make to me?
Reiko: It’s not for you. It’s for the mourners. Having a ceremony and a burial will help them grieve.
Lucas: Not my friends and family. The less fuss the better for them. Most of my family is buried in simple gravesites in non-denominational cemeteries.
Reiko: What’s the fun in that?
Lucas: I think you’re forgetting one thing: we’re talking about death. It’s not supposed to be fun and games!
[end of dialogue]
Reiko begins our dialogue by saying, “When I die, I want a big funeral.” A “funeral” is a ceremony that you have after a person dies; it is a way of allowing people to say goodbye. Funerals have been around for as long as we have any sort of recorded history in almost every culture. Sometimes the funeral is religious; sometimes it is not. Reiko says she wants a big funeral. She says, “The more mourners the better!” A “mourner” (mourner) is a person who is very sad because someone they know has died, usually a friend or a member of the family, or it could just be someone they know very well. “To mourn,” as a verb, means to feel sad because someone has died; you’re remembering that person. Often, mourners wear (at least in Western traditions) black if they are “in mourning,” that is, if they are observing the time of sadness, of grief, of sorrow after someone has died.

What Else Does It Mean?
wake
The word “wake,” in this podcast, means the period of time after death but before a funeral, when people meet in that person’s home to remember the person and talk about his or her life, usually while eating: “We’re making a lasagna to bring to Pete’s wake.” The phrase “in the wake of (something)” is used to talk about something that happens after something else and as a result of it: “Many people died in the wake of the flooding.” A “wake-up call” is a call that one requests at a hotel to help one wake up at a certain time the next morning: “Please give me a wake-up call at 6:45.” Another meaning of “wake-up call” is something that happens unexpectedly and makes one think about what one is doing and decide to change things: “Xiaofeng’s driving accident was a wake-up call that made her friends become better drivers.”
to scatter
In this podcast, the verb “to scatter” means to spread around or to put a small amount of something over a large area: “They scattered leaves on the table as decoration.” The verb “to scatter” can also mean for many people to leave an area in many different directions very quickly, usually because they are scared: “The birds scattered when the boy shouted.” The phrase “scattered showers” refers to short periods of rain that happen many times during the day: “Expect scattered showers this afternoon, with heavy rain tomorrow morning.” Finally, the word “scatterbrained” is used to describe someone who is very distracted and cannot remember things well, or doesn’t know what he or she is doing: “Shelby is so scatterbrained she doesn’t even remember where she parked her car.”
Culture Note
People often visit the gravesites of their “deceased” (dead) loved ones, but some people also like to visit the “tombs” (mausoleums; stone buildings for dead bodies) of famous people.
For example, the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii is where two of Hawaii’s “royal” (relating to kings and queens) families are buried. Visitors can go to a “chapel” (small church) and, behind the chapel, see the tombs of Hawaiian kings and their families.
Lincoln’s Tomb, in Springfield, Illinois, is the tomb of the United States’ 16th president, Abraham Lincoln. People can go there “to pay their respects” (to show one’s admiration for someone who has died) for his “role” (the way a person acted and the things he or she did) in U.S. history.
Many people who go to Washington, D.C. visit Arlington National Cemetery, which is a very large cemetery where more than 300,000 people are buried. Most of them fought in wars for the United States or were important “figures” (people) in “public services” (jobs where one works for the government and tries to help other people).
Arlington National Cemetery has a “monument” (something that is built to remember an important person or event) called the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It is “dedicated to” (said to be in honor of) all the “unknown soldiers” (people who die while fighting for their country, and whose bodies are found, although their names and identities are not known). The tomb is always “guarded” (watched over) by men in “uniform” (standard clothing), and people come to watch the “changing of the guard” (the ceremony where guards leave and new guards come).
