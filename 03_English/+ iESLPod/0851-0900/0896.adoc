Our dialogue today is between Lourdes and Valerie, about giving a speech – talking to a large group of people. Let’s get started.
[start of dialog]
Lourdes: I need help.
Valery: Sure, what’s up?
Lourdes: I’m supposed to give a speech at the start of the conference next month and I don’t know what to do.
Valery: It’s not that hard to plan out a speech. You start with an attention getter using humor or telling a personal story.
Lourdes: Okay, I guess I can do that.
Valery: After that, in your introduction, you should tell the audience what your speech is about in a thesis statement. Along the way, you should establish your credibility by mentioning why you’re qualified to talk about this topic.
Lourdes: All right.
Valery: Then, in the body of your speech, you want to state your main points, using supporting ideas, giving examples, and maybe using visuals.
Lourdes: Okay.
Valery: And finally, in the conclusion, you restate your main points and make some closing remarks. Simple, right?
Lourdes: Yeah, simple. One last question.
Valery: Shoot.
Lourdes: What are you doing the morning of June 20th, and how do you feel about standing in for a coworker who plans to be deathly ill?

Lourdes begins by saying to Valerie, “I need help.” Valerie says, “Sure, what's up?” What’s going on? What's happening? Lourdes says, “I'm supposed to give a speech at the start of the conference next month, and I don't know what to do.” A “speech” is a formal presentation, a spoken presentation in front of a group of people. Valerie says, “It's not that hard to plan out a speech.” “To plan out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to plan all of the details of something, to prepare for it completely, to have a very good idea about everything you're going to do. Valerie says, “It's not hard” – it's not difficult – “to plan out a speech.” “You start with an attention getter using humor or telling a personal story.” “To get someone's attention” means to get them to listen to you, to get them to listen to the things you are saying. An “attention getter” would be something at the beginning of your speech that will make everyone stop and listen to you. Sometimes you can tell a story, sometimes you can use humor. “Humor” (humor) just means a joke, something funny, something that will make people laugh.
Lourdes says, “Okay. I guess I can do that.” She's not too sure. Valerie says, “After that” – after the attention getter – “in your introduction, you should tell the audience what your speech is about in a thesis statement.” Your “introduction” is the opening of your speech, the first part of your speech. There's an old rule that when you give a speech, when you give a formal talk, first, you tell people what you're going to tell them. Say, “I’m going to talk about this and this and this.” Then you tell them those things in the same order – this and this and this – and then at the end, you tell them what you just told them, you summarize.
That's what Valerie is suggesting here. Lourdes should tell the audience – the people listening to her – what the speech is going to be about in a “thesis statement.” A “thesis (thesis) statement” is usually associated with formal writing, an essay. Valerie is using this idea to help Lourdes understand what she's supposed to do. Your thesis statement in an essay, in a written essay, is a short statement, usually one sentence, that gives the main idea of what you are going to talk about.
Valerie says, “Along the way, you should establish your credibility by mentioning why you are qualified to talk about this topic.” “Along the way” is an expression we use to mean “as you are doing something.” This expression is often used when we are talking about traveling. “I'm going to drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco, and along the way I'm going to stop at Fresno to visit my friend.” “Along the way” – as I am traveling from one place to another.
Valerie, when using this expression, is telling Lourdes that as she is giving her speech, she needs to establish her credibility. “To establish your credibility” (credibility) means to demonstrate that you are knowledgeable, that you are qualified, that you know something about this topic that gives you the authority, gives you the right, if you will, to talk about it. You know what you're talking about. If you're going to talk about the weather, you would want to know your audience will want to know why you are qualified to talk about the weather. Do you have a degree in the science of studying the weather, what’s called “meteorology”? That would help.
Valerie says that Lourdes should establish her credibility by mentioning why she's qualified to talk about this topic. “To be qualified” means to have the knowledge or experience to do something. Lourdes says, “Alright,” meaning okay.
Valerie says, “Then in the body of your speech, you want to state your main points using supporting ideas, giving examples, and maybe using visuals.” The “body (body)” of your speech is the main section, the main part, where you tell people with details, the things that you told them you were going to tell them about in your introduction. We call these your “main points.” Your main points are your most important points, the most important messages that you want to give to your audience about your topic.
Valerie suggests using supporting ideas when talking about your main points. “Supporting” means helping. “Supporting ideas” would be ideas that help people understand what your main point is. It could be evidence. It could be proof of what you are saying. You could also give them examples of what you are talking about to help them understand. “Maybe,” Valerie says, “you could use visuals.” “Visual” (visual) is something you can see. Visuals are things that you use, often in a presentation or a speech, that shows people what it is you are trying to tell them about. It gives them something to look at. If you're talking about geography, about where things are, a visual would be a map that would show people what you're talking about.
Lourdes says, “Okay.” Valerie then says, “And finally, in the conclusion, you restate your main points and make some closing remarks.” Your “conclusion” is at the end of your speech. “At the end of your speech,” Valerie says, “you should restate your main points.” “To restate” (restate) means to say again. The prefix “re-“ in English, is typically used to mean “again,” to do something again. A “replay” is to play something one more time. Valerie says, “You should restate,” or say again, “your main points and make some closing remarks.” “Closing remarks” are things you say at the very end of your presentation – the “close” of your presentation.
Valerie says, “Simple, right?” Lourdes says, “Yeah, simple. One last question.” Valerie says, “Shoot.” “Shoot” (shoot) is a phrase we use informally to tell the other person to continue asking the question. Usually, it's in response to another person who has said that he wants to ask you a question. You may have someone come up to you and say, “Can I ask you a favor?” Can I ask you to do something for me? And you say, “Shoot.” You mean, “Okay, ask me your favor. Tell me what you want me to do.” Lourdes wants to ask Valerie a question, so Valerie says, “Shoot.” “Go ahead.”
Lourdes says, “What are you doing the morning of June 20th, and how do you feel about standing in for a coworker who plans to be deathly ill?” Lourdes is asking Valerie what he's going to do on a certain day – June 20th – and how he feels about, what is his opinion, about “standing in for a coworker.” “To stand in for someone” is to take the place of another person when that person isn't available, to do what they're supposed to do, especially in a work environment. Lourdes is joking, of course. She's asking Valerie if he would like to give this speech, if he would like to “stand in” for his coworker. His coworker is the person he works with, in this case, Lourdes.
Lourdes plans to be “deathly ill” that day. “To be ill” means to be sick. “To be deathly ill” means to be so sick, you could die. Once again Lourdes is making a joke here. She's hoping that Valerie will agree to do this speech since he seems to know everything about giving speeches.
Being a teacher and former professor, I've given lots of speeches. I like giving speeches. I don't think I’m very good at giving speeches, but I like to give speeches. So, if your organization wants me to give a speech, send me an email. I might not know what I'm talking about, but I'm happy to give a speech!
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed
[start of dialog]
Lourdes: I need help.
Valery: Sure, what’s up?
Lourdes: I’m supposed to give a speech at the start of the conference next month and I don’t know what to do.
Valery: It’s not that hard to plan out a speech. You start with an attention getter using humor or telling a personal story.
Lourdes: Okay, I guess I can do that.
Valery: After that, in your introduction, you should tell the audience what your speech is about in a thesis statement. Along the way, you should establish your credibility by mentioning why you’re qualified to talk about this topic.
Lourdes: All right.

Lourdes: Yeah, simple. One last question.
Valery: Shoot.
Lourdes: What are you doing the morning of June 20th, and how do you feel about standing in for a coworker who plans to be deathly ill?

Culture Note
Types of Speeches
People are expected to make many different kinds of speeches, both “professionally” (at work) and “personally” (in daily life). One of the most common types of speeches, especially at work, is an “informative” speech, which is designed to share information. Informative speeches are often used to report on a project or study. “Academics” (people who work in universities) make informative speeches at conferences when they present the results of their research.
Other speeches are “persuasive” and are intended to convince other people to do certain things, “adopt certain beliefs” (take certain beliefs as their own), or perform certain actions. Politicians often make persuasive speeches to try to get their “constituents” (the people who are represented by a politician) to support them in some effort, or to try to get their colleagues to “enact” (make into law) a particular law.
“Entertaining” speeches are designed to “entertain” (interest and amuse) the listeners. Entertaining speeches are made for the audience’s enjoyment. An “after-dinner speech” (a speech made at a formal event after everyone has eaten) might be an entertaining speech that helps people relax after a long conference.
Some speeches are expected on “special occasions” (holidays or other days filled with special meaning). For example, before a wedding, close friends and family members of the “bride and groom” (the woman and man getting married) are expected to speak at the “rehearsal dinner” (a meal for everyone who will play an official role in the wedding). The “best man” (the groom’s best friend) and the father of the bride typically give a speech during the “wedding reception” (a party held after the wedding ceremony). And at a funeral, people may be asked to give a “eulogy” (a speech that remembers and praises someone who has died).
