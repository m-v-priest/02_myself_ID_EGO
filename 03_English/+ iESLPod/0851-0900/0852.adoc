This episode is a dialog between Tony and Amber about working in a factory – a place where things are made or manufactured. Let’s get started!
[start of dialog]
Tony: The plant manager says that you’re the new kid.
Amber: Yes, it’s my first day.
Tony: All right, you’ll be a line worker like the rest of us. Here’s your workstation. What you have to remember is that output and productivity are the most important things around here.
Amber: I understand, but...
Tony: Watch out for that forklift! You have to watch where you’re going or you’ll ruin our safety record.
Amber: Sorry. When will I get trained to use this machinery? I’ve never worked on an assembly line before to mass-produce anything.
Tony: I’m going to teach you, so pay attention. The other thing you have to worry about around here is quality control. If you don’t do things right, you’ll hear about it.
Amber: Okay, but...
Tony: Hey, sit down! As I said before, if you’re not careful, you’ll get your head taken off in this factory. Now, try to pay attention.
Amber: I’m trying, but it’s hard to do when my life is in danger every other minute.
Tony: [sighs] Rookies!
[end of dialog]
Tony begins our dialog by saying to Amber, “The plant manager says that you’re the new kid.” A “plant (plant) manager (manager)” is the most important supervisor in a factory, the most important boss. “Plant” here refers to a place where things are made. A factory, which is in the title of our episode, is also a place where things are made. The two words mean the same, “factory” or “plant.” When I say, “things are made,” I mean, typically, physical things – chairs or cars or doors. We’re not talking about computer software, for example, but the actual computers, the physical machines would be made in a plant or in a factory. Tony refers to the “plant manager,” calling Amber the “new kid,” meaning the new employee, in this case. It doesn’t mean that she’s actually a child.
Amber says, “Yes, it’s my first day.” Tony says, “All right, you’ll be a line worker like the rest of us.” A “line (line) worker” is a person who has a “low level job,” we would call it, not a very important or complicated job – usually, working on what’s called an “assembly line.” An “assembly line” is when you are making some product, some thing, and everyone does something in order. Often, you’re all standing next to each other. So, I may put in the first screw and I give it to you, and you put in a bolt, and then you give it to another person and they put a cover on, and then they give it to someone else, and you’re doing the same thing over and over again all day. That’s being a line worker.
Tony says to Amber, “Here’s your workstation.” Your “workstation” is the place, of course, where you work. It’s usually a small area, maybe a desk, but not a complete office, not an entire office of your own. In a factory, your workstation might just be a very small table, for example.
“What you have to remember,” Tony says, “is that output and productivity are the most important things around here.” “Output” (output) is what a person or a machine produces – what they make. A big factory may make thousands of telephones, cellular telephones, mobile phones, everyday or even every hour. That would be their output. “Productivity” refers to how much work you get done in a certain amount of time. When productivity increases, workers are able to produce more with the same amount of time. So, instead of producing a thousand cell phones a day, the same amount of workers with the same amount of time, produce ten thousand new cell phones. This is an increase in productivity, either because the workers are working harder or because the technology allows to be more productive, to have a higher output. Notice I use “high” or “low” for output. For productivity, we talk about it “rising” or “falling.”
Amber says, “I understand but…” Tony interrupts her and says, “Watch out for that forklift!” “Watch out” means “be careful.” A “forklift” (forklift) is a machine with a large, strong piece of metal in the front of it. Typically there’re like two bars, and they go underneath heavy objects and are able to lift them up and take them from one place to another. So, if you have a heavy box, you might have a forklift come, and it puts these two bars – flat bars – underneath it, and it looks kind of like a fork. So, that’s why it’s called a “forklift.” Then it is able to lift it up and move it to another location.
Tony says, “You have to watch where you’re going or you’ll ruin our safety record.” “Safety” is the opposite of having accidents. “Safety” refers to people not getting hurt, not getting injured, not getting killed. The “safety record of the factory,” or the plant, refers to how many people are injured in the factory every year, and many times, there are injuries. There are people who get hurt in factories or in plants.
Amber says, “Sorry. When will I get trained to use this machinery?” “Machinery” (machinery) are large pieces of equipment typically operated by electricity or some other power source. “Machinery” usually refers to a piece of equipment that makes something else, although not always.
Amber says, “I’ve never worked on an assembly line before to mass-produce anything.” An “assembly (assembly) line” is, as we referred to earlier, the process where you have many people working to build or create something, and each person does the same thing over and over again. I do one thing, then you do something, then the next person does something else. An “assembly line” can also have machines instead of people, and many of them do nowadays. “Assembly” comes from the verb “to assemble” (assemble) which means to put something together.
Amber says that she’s never worked on an assembly line before, “to mass-produce anything.” “To produce” means to make. “To mass- (mass) produce” means to make a large amount of things, especially things that are identical. They’re not made for an individual person. You make the same thing over and over again. Tony says, “I’m going to teach you, so pay attention,” meaning focus on what I’m saying.
“The other thing you have to worry about around here is quality control.” “Quality” is how good or bad something is. “Control” is making sure something is the way it’s supposed to be. So, “quality control” is testing the products, testing the things that are made to make sure that they were made correctly.
“If you don’t do things right,” Tony says, “you’ll hear about it.” This expression “you’ll hear about it,” means, usually, that you’ve done something wrong and that you are being told about it and probably will be punished for it. So, a child might be told by his parent, “If you cause any problems on the playground today, you’ll hear about it,” meaning I’m going to talk to you about it and it’s not going to be good news.
Amber says, “Okay but…” Tony again interrupts her and says, “Hey, sit down! As I said before, if you’re not careful, you’ll get your head taken off in this factory.” “To be taken off” means to be removed or separated. Tony is telling Amber to be careful. She apparently started to stand up and perhaps another machine was moving past her. The factory, of course, is the plant, the building where things are made. Tony says, “Now, try to pay attention.” Amber says, “I’m trying, but it’s hard to do when my life is in danger every other minute.” “Every other minute” means often, very often, very frequently.
Tony is not very happy with Amber. He sighs. He goes “(sighs) Rookies!” A “rookie” (rookie) is someone who is new to a job or new to an organization, someone who doesn’t have very much experience. We usually use this term in talking about sports, somebody who is new to the professional teams or the professional leagues. A baseball player from college, who then starts playing for one of the professional baseball teams like the Los Angeles Dodgers, that person would be called a “rookie” during their first year. They’re new. The term more generally means anyone who’s new to doing something; usually, someone with less experience.
Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

What Else Does It Mean?
plant manager
The phrase “plant manager,” in this podcast, means the main supervisor of a factory, or the person who is responsible for the operation of a factory and the work of the other employees: “The plant manager needs us to increase our output to prepare for the holiday sales.” A “middle manager” is someone who manages a small part of a company and is not the main manager: “I don’t want to be a middle manager for the rest of my life.” A “stage manager” is someone who is responsible of the technical aspects of a theatrical production: “The stage manager is trying to improve the lighting on the stage.” Finally, a “road manager” is someone who coordinates the technical arrangements for a musician or entertainer who is traveling: “The road manager has finished making all of the hotel reservations.”
every other minute
In this podcast, the phrase “every other minute” means very often or very frequently and repeatedly: “Please make a decision and stick with it instead of changing your mind every other minute!” The phrase “last-minute” describes something that is done immediately before it is due or required: “They made a last-minute decision to increase the ticket price right before ticket sales began.” The phrase “up-to-the-minute” means with the most current, updated information possible: “The news station does a good job of providing up-to-the-minute coverage of local news stories.” Finally, the phrase “by the minute” describes something that is continuing to grow or change in some way: “The situation is becoming more complicated and more dangerous by the minute.”
Culture Note
Rosie the Riveter
During World War II, many women “left the home” (got a job outside of the home) and began working in factories while the men were “at war” (fighting in the war). These women were “referred to” (called; spoken about as) “Rosie the Riveter.” The verb “to rivet” means to “fasten” (connect) two pieces of metal together with a small, straight piece of metal. Many women working in factories were riveting together large pieces of equipment, so from that, we get this “nickname” (an informal name used when talking to or about someone).
The phrase “Rosie the Riveter” first appeared in a song “of the same name” (with that title) in 1942, but the nickname really “took hold” (became popular and well known) with the production and distribution of a “poster” (a large piece of paper with an image and text, hung on a wall) by Howard Miller. The poster shows a woman, known as Rosie the Riveter, looking directly at the reader. She wears a red “handkerchief” (a square piece of fabric) over her hair and her “sleeves” (the part of a shirt covering one’s arms) are rolled up as she “flexes her bicep” (folds her arm to make the muscle between one’s elbow and shoulder appear larger). The top of the poster says, “We Can Do It!”
The original poster was intended to “boost” (increase) “morale” (positive thoughts and feelings) among female workers. Later, it became “associated with” (thought about in connection with) female “empowerment” (helping someone have the power to do something) and “feminism” (the belief that women are powerful and valuable and should be treated as men are treated).
