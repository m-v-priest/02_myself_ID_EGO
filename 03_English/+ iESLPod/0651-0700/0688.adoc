On this episode, we’re going to hear a dialogue between Jerry and Camila about what happens when two companies or two people decide to end their business partnership or relationship. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Jerry: Who’s going to break the news to Tech Experts?
Camila: You mean about pulling the plug on using their services?
Jerry: Yeah, the contract we signed with them last year is almost up, and as we decided last month, we’ll be going with another company.
Camila: I think we should hold off on telling them until after all of our current projects are done. We still have two more in the hopper.
Jerry: Okay, but I don’t want to drag our feet in telling them, even if we’re not happy with their service. As a professional courtesy, we should let them know soon.
Camila: That may be true with other companies, but Tech Experts has really let us down this past year. If we didn’t have an airtight contract with them, we would have switched companies long ago.
Jerry: Well, maybe they’ll learn from their mistakes. After all, they’ve been in business a long time.
Camila: Yeah, but old habits die hard. And if you ask me, the company is on its last legs. It’s only a matter of time before they lose most of their customers, at the rate they’re going.
Jerry: I don’t know about that, but I do know one thing. It’s a good thing you’re not their PR rep!
[end of dialogue]
Jerry says to Camila, “Who’s going to break the news to Tech Experts?” Tech Experts is the name of a company. The expression “to break the news” means to tell someone something that he or she does not want to hear, to give bad news to someone. People may say something like, “I hate to break the news, but it’s raining today and our baseball game is cancelled. We won’t be playing baseball.” So Jerry, here, is asking who’s going to break the news, who’s going to give this company they’ve been working with the bad news.
Camila says, “You mean about pulling the plug on using their services?” “To pull the plug” (plug) here means to end a project or to end a relationship or agreement. More generally, it means to stop doing something. The expression comes from or has its origin in the fact that when you have a machine many times it needs electricity, and the wire that runs between the machine and, for example, the wall, where there is a place to put the wire into to get electricity, that wire is called a “cord.” The thing that goes into the wall itself is called a “plug.” So, “to pull the plug” means the same as to disconnect, “to unplug,” you could also say, a machine. Here, it means to end a relationship. So, Camila answers Jerry’s question about who’s going to break the news to Tech Experts with another question, clarifying what news Jerry is talking about. She says, “You mean (the news) about pulling the plug on using their services (on keeping Tech Experts as one of the businesses they have a relationship with)?”
Jerry says, “Yeah (an informal way of saying yes), the contract we signed with them last year is almost up.” A “contract” is a legal agreement, typically written though it doesn’t have to be. “To be up” is an expression – a phrasal verb meaning to end, to finish at a particular time or date. Someone might say to you, “Your time is up.” A teacher, for example, to her students if they are taking a test and the hour is finished, she might say, “Your time is up,” you have no more time, you must stop. Well here, Jerry is saying that the contract is up, meaning the contract will end. He says, “as we decided last month, we’ll be going with another company,” meaning we’ll be using another company after the contract between their company and Tech Experts is finished.
Camila says, “I think we should hold off on telling them until after all of our current projects are done.” “To hold off on (something)” is a phrasal verb meaning to delay, to postpone, to wait to do something until later. For example: “John decided to hold off on asking the pretty girl in his Spanish class for a date until he ended his relationship with the other pretty girl from his math class.” Isn’t John a nice guy? He’s going to wait, he’s going to hold off on getting a new girlfriend until he gets rid of his old girlfriend. Camila uses this same structure, “to hold off on,” and then later in the sentence “until.” She says, “I think we should hold off on telling them until after all of our current projects are done.” For those interested in the grammar behind this expression, notice that “on” is a preposition, and so the object of the prepositional phrase must be a noun. “Telling” is a gerund, which is a form of a verb that acts as a noun. So, you can’t say, “I’m going to hold off on to tell him,” because “to tell” is a verb. You can say, “I’m going to hold off on telling him,” because “telling” is a noun in this case.
Anyway, getting back to the story, Camila says, “We still have two more in the hopper.” She means we have two more projects with this company in the hopper (hopper). Something that is “in the hopper” is something that is in process, things that you are currently working on. You haven’t finished them yet, but you are working on them or will be working on them very soon. Camila says we still have two projects with this company, we shouldn’t tell them we’re going to end after the expiration of their contract until we finish with these projects.
Jerry says, “Okay, but I don’t want to drag our feet in telling them.” “To drag your feet” means to do something very slowly, more slowly than you should, to delay, to procrastinate. “I’ve been dragging my feet on cleaning the kitchen.” Really I have, I need to clean my kitchen. My wife is not happy with me just between me and you, don’t tell anyone! Anyway, Jerry says, “I don’t want to drag our feet in telling them.” Notice “in” is also a preposition, and therefore it needs a noun, “telling” is a noun form and that works. You can’t say, “I don’t want to drag our feet in to tell them,” just like the previous example of “to hold off on.” Jerry says, “As a professional courtesy, we should let them know soon.” He’s saying even though they are not happy with the service that Tech Experts has given them, as a professional courtesy we should tell them about our decision soon. “Professional courtesy” is something that you do or say in business because it is considered the correct, the polite, the nice thing to do. You don’t have to do it, but it’s nice if you do do it.
Well, Camila doesn’t want to be nice. She says, “That may be true with other companies (that is, we should let them know as a professional courtesy), but Tech Experts has really let us down this past year.” “To let (someone) down” means to disappoint someone, to do something not as well as someone was expecting you to do, or not do what someone was expecting you to do. You let them down, they became disappointed. Camila says, “If we didn’t have an airtight contract with them, we would have switched companies long ago.” “Airtight” (one word) means very carefully written, something that has no mistakes, no errors. It’s often used to describe something in a legal situation, where a contract, for example, doesn’t have any weaknesses; there are no things you can use as an exception. That’s “airtight.”
Jerry says, “Well, maybe they’ll learn from their mistakes. After all, they’ve been in business a long time.” That is, Tech Experts will learn from their mistakes. Camila doesn’t agree; she says, “Yeah, but old habits die hard.” This expression means it’s difficult for people or organizations to change. They are much more likely to continue doing the same things they have done in the past even if they’re not very good or very successful. “Old habits die hard.” “Die hard,” just like the movie Die Hard, “to die hard” means it dies a difficult death, it is something that dies with a lot of pain perhaps. That’s also what is going on here when we say “old habits die hard,” it’s very difficult for you to change or kill your habits, the things you’re used to doing.
Camila says, “And if you ask me, the company is on its last legs.” “To be on your last legs” (legs), like the legs you walk on, means that you are about to die or about to fail, that you’re very weak, that you’re almost finished. In this case, we’re talking about a company on its last legs. Camila says, “It’s only a matter of time before they lose most of their customers.” “It’s only a matter of time” means that it is, we would say, “inevitable,” that is, it’s going to happen, it’s not something you can avoid. It will happen, it’s just a matter of when it will happen; it could be today, it could be next week, it could be 10 years from now, but eventually this thing will happen. Camila says it’s only a matter of time before Tech Experts loses most of their customers at the rate they’re going. The expression “at the rate they’re going” is used to show how someone is performing or acting, assuming that it will not change. So for example, you’re spending 10 dollars every week on buying sandwiches. At the rate you’re going, by the end of the year you will have spent 520 dollars on sandwiches if you continue doing what you have done in the past. That’s the idea.
Jerry says, “I don’t know about that (meaning I’m not sure you are correct), but I do know one thing. It’s a good thing you’re not their PR rep!” He’s making a little joke; he’s saying Camila is being so critical of the company it’s a good thing she doesn’t work as that company’s public relations or PR rep. “Rep” stands for representative. A “PR rep” is someone who works for a company who tries to give a positive image – a good image of the company, especially to news organizations, to newspapers, television stations, and so forth. “Public relations” is about getting a positive message out about your company to your customers or your potential customers, people who might want to buy your product or service.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue again, this time at a normal speed.

Culture Note
Common Legal Clauses
Legal contracts contain many common “clauses” (sections of a legal contract dealing with one particular part of the law) that are seen “over and over again” (many times). Often these clauses are just copied and pasted from one contract to the next, and only a small “portion” (part) of the contract is actually written “from scratch” (without using a model).
For example, an “arbitration clause” “stipulates” (states) how “conflicts” and “disputes” (disagreements) should be “resolved” (ended by reaching a solution). They often establish how the “parties” (the people or organizations that sign a contract) should communicate their dispute and when a “mediator” (a person who helps the parties resolve their conflict) should be brought into the situation. The clause also indicates whether the arbitration will occur within a specific “jurisdiction” (the area where a particular person or entity can make legal decisions).
Another common contract clause is the “statute of limitations.” This clause establishes the maximum amount of time after a particular event that something may happen. For example, a statute of limitations might state that people can be “prosecuted” (charged in court) for certain crimes for only five years after the crime occurred. If more than five years have “elapsed” (passed by), they cannot be taken to court for the crime.
An “attorney fees clause” establishes that if there is “litigation” (legal action) between the two parties, the party that does not win must pay all the “reasonable” (fair and just) “legal fees” (amounts of money paid to a lawyer) “incurred by” (needing to be paid by) the winning party.
