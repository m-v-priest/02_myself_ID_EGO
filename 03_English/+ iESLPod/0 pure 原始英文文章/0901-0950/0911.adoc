This episode is a dialog between Danny and Sybil about how you correct someone in a conversation. Let's get started.
[start of dialog]
Danny: You look like you need to relax.
Sybil: Excuse me?
Danny: What I mean is, you look like you could use some R and R.
Sybil: I didn’t know I looked tired and worn out.
Danny: No, what I’m trying to say is, people need leisure time once in a while.
Sybil: Yes, that’s certainly true.
Danny: The human body needs downtime to recuperate and to regenerate.
Sybil: Okay, I guess that’s true.
Danny: Let me rephrase that. People need time away from work to get ready for more work.
Sybil: Are you saying you’re planning on giving me more work?
Danny: No, no, no. Let me put it another way. It’s imperative that you don’t work this weekend.
Sybil: Why? What’s going on this weekend? Are you saying that something big is happening in the department this weekend and I’m being left out?
Danny: No, not at all. What I’m trying to say is...[sigh]...would you like to go out with me Saturday night?
Sybil: Oh, I guess I didn’t catch your drift earlier. You’re asking me out for Saturday.
Danny: Yes, I am.
Sybil: Then, I accept.
Danny: Really?
Sybil: Yes, as long as you promise never to ask me out on a first date ever again!
[end of dialog]
Danny begins a dialog by saying to Sybil, “You look like you need to relax.” You look like you need to be calmer, less worried, less anxious. Sybil says, “Excuse me?” The expression “excuse me” is used in a lot of different ways. Here it's used when someone says something to you and you don't really understand why they said it. You might also be a little upset or angry that they said this to you, so you're indicating your displeasure, the fact that you don't like what they said.
That's why Sybil says “Excuse me?” She's not very happy that Danny has told her that she needs to relax. Danny then corrects himself. He says, “What I mean is you look like you could use some R and R.” The phrase “what I mean is,” is used when you've just said something that the other person didn't understand, or you don't think the other person understood correctly, and you want to give another way of saying it. You want to say it in a different way. So, when Sybil says, “Excuse me,” indicating she didn't like what Danny said, Danny says, “What I mean is, you look like you could use some R and R.” “R and R” stands for “Rest and Relaxation.”
Sybil said, “I didn't know I looked tired and worn out.” Sybil thinks that Danny is criticizing her, in a way, saying that she looks tired and worn out. “To be worn (worn) out” means to be very tired, both physically and perhaps mentally. Danny realizes that Sybil still doesn't like the way he expressed his idea. So, he uses another phrase to correct himself again.
He says, “No, what I'm trying to say is, people need leisure time once in a while.” “What I'm trying to say is” means the same as “what I mean is.” It's an expression or a phrase you would use in a conversation when you need to correct yourself, or you need to say something in a different way. Danny says that people need leisure time once in a while. “Leisure” (leisure) means time that you do what you enjoy, time that you do some activity that isn't work.
Finally, Sybil seems to understand what he's saying. She says, “Yes, that's certainly true.” Danny continues, “The human body needs downtime to recuperate and to regenerate.” He is saying that our bodies, our physical bodies, need “downtime.” “Downtime” – one word – is time that you don't have anything scheduled. It’s time where you are just going to do whatever you feel like doing. It's similar to leisure, although you could have downtime at your work, where you don't have anything scheduled. You can relax a little, but still have to think of something to do. “Downtime” in this conversation, in this dialog, means something closer to leisure, relaxation.
“The body needs downtime,” Danny says, “to recuperate.” “To recuperate” (recuperate) means to recover, usually to recover from some sort of sickness or illness. In this case, the body needs time to recuperate, to get its energy back. “To regenerate” is another verb that Danny uses here. “Regenerate” (regenerate) means to become renewed, almost to take on a new life. It's not that common of an expression or a verb in cases such as this, but it's possible to say that the body needs time to regenerate. Literally, it means to “make again,” to generate again, to create again.
Sybil says, “Okay. I guess that's true.” Again, Sybil is not perhaps happy with what Danny has said, and Danny sensing this, seeing this, says, “Let me rephrase that.” “To rephrase” (rephrase) means to express an idea in a different way, especially if the first time you said it wasn't exactly what you wanted to say or was unclear. This is another way of correcting yourself, of saying, “Wait a minute. Let me say this in a different way.” Danny says, “Let me rephrase that. People need time away from work to get ready for more work.” Now Danny is presenting a little different idea. He’s saying that we need down time and leisure so that we can work even more.
Sybil says, “Are you saying you're planning on giving me more work?” Now we realize Danny appears to be Sybil’s boss. So, Sybil asks Danny if he is planning on giving her more work, and that's why he's telling her to relax and so forth. Danny says, “No, no, no. Let me put it another way.” “To put something another way” is to say it in a different way. This is another expression, another phrase you can use when you want to correct what you just said or when the person misunderstood you. “Let me put it another way.” It means the same as “Let me rephrase that.”
Danny says, “It's imperative that you don't work this weekend.” Something that is “imperative” (imperative) is something that is extremely important, something that is necessary, something that is required. Danny is saying, “It's imperative that you do not work this weekend.” Sybil says, “Why?” “What's going on? – What's happening? – “this weekend? Are you saying that something big is happening in the department this weekend and I’m being left out?” “To be left out” means not to be included in some activity or some discussion. We could also say “to be excluded.” That's “to be left out.”
Now Sybil is worrying that Danny doesn't want her to be part of something important. Danny says, “No, not at all,” meaning “No, you're not being left out.” “What I'm trying to say is,” and he sighs – he goes [sighing] – “would you like to go out with me Saturday night?” Danny, who remember, we think is Sybil’s boss, is asking her out on a date, is asking if she would like to go and spend time with him this weekend. He said, “Would you like to go out with me this weekend?” – Saturday night. “To go out with someone” means to go on a date with them. I'm not sure if this is a good idea for the boss to be asking one of his employees out on a date. Most companies don't like that. Well, Danny is doing it anyway!
Sybil says, “Oh, I didn't catch your drift earlier.” “To catch someone's drift” (drift) is an old expression meaning to understand the main idea of what someone else is saying, to get the general idea of what another person is telling you. Sybil says she did not catch Danny's drift earlier. She says, “You're asking me out for Saturday.” Danny says, “Yes, I am.”
Sybil says, “Then, I accept.” Danny says, “Really?” He’s surprised. And he should be. I mean, Danny is not an attractive person. I mean, he’s not as good-looking as Sybil. Danny says, “Really?” Sybil says, “Yes, as long as you promise never to ask me out on a first date ever again.” Sybil is making a little joke here. Of course, you can only ask someone out on a first date once. You can only do something the first time once. She's also saying that Danny did not do a very good job on asking her out on this date, and I think we can all agree that's true.
Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

downtime
The word “downtime,” in this podcast, means time that is open and unscheduled, when one does not have any responsibilities and one can relax: “If we get any downtime during the conference in New York City, I’d love to visit the Statue of Liberty.” The word “downtime” is also the period of time when a computer or a network is not working: “Nobody can promise 0% downtime.” The opposite word is “uptime,” used to describe when a computer is working normally: “Can you guarantee 99.9% uptime?” Finally, the word “overtime” describes hours worked by an employee who is paid by the hour outside of regularly scheduled hours, when he or she receives additional money per hour: “Truck drivers can make a lot of money in overtime.”

Culture Note
Autocorrection and Autocompletion
“Word processors” (computer programs that make it simpler to create written documents, such as Microsoft Word) have many “features” (characteristics; offerings) to help users prepare their documents. One popular feature is “autocorrection,” which automatically corrects words that users “mistype” (type incorrectly). For example, if a user types “yuor” the autocorrection feature will change it to “your” without “alerting” (notifying) the user. This is different than “spell check,” which alerts the user that a word is misspelled and offers several suggestions of similar words that are spelled correctly. Autocorrection also corrects capitalization problems. For example, if the first two letters of a word are capitalized, the autocorrection feature makes sure that only the first letter is capitalized. And if the first letter is “lowercase” (not capitalized) but the other letters are “uppercase” (capitalized), the autocorrection feature corrects the accidental use of “caps lock” (the key on a keyboard that changes all letters so that they are in uppercase).
An “autocompletion” feature, also known as “word completion,” is different, but uses similar technology. An autocompletion feature “anticipates” (predicts; guesses) what the user is going to type and “inserts” (puts in) that word before the user finishes typing it. This is now common on smart phones with very small keyboards that are difficult to type on. Once the user types the first few letters of a word, the autocompletion feature suggests a few words and the user can “tap” (gently touch) one of them to insert the word more quickly than he or she can finish typing it.
Autocorrection and autocompletion features can be very helpful, especially for poor “typists” (people who type), but they are not “foolproof”—that is, they can make mistakes. When using autocorrection and autocompletion features, carefully “proofreading” (checking text for errors) becomes more important than ever.
