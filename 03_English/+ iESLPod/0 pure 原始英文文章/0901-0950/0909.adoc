This episode is a dialogue between Kindo and Nookie about buying electronic books. Let's get started.
[start of dialog]
Kindo: What’s that?
Nookie: It’s my new e-book reader. I’m just downloading some new books onto it.
Kindo: I haven’t bought one yet. I’m old school. I still prefer a printed book.
Nookie: But if you haven’t tried it yet, how do you know you wouldn’t like it better? This e-book reader can store over 10,000 digital books and it’s easily portable. Imagine trying to carry an entire library from place to place.
Kindo: I don’t usually read 10,000 books all at once and I hear that there are a lot of incompatible formats out there. Each company is trying to edge out the others by establishing their format as the format. I think I’ll just wait until the dust settles.
Nookie: The different formats aren’t that big a deal. You can easily convert a book in one format to another.
Kindo: I like the look of text on a printed page.
Nookie: You mean that faded text on that yellowed page? On an e-book reader, you can adjust the text size, font, and even line spacing.
Kindo: Can I get all of the out-of-print books on my shelves in digital format?
Nookie: Well, I’m not sure.
Kindo: Until I can, I’ll stick to my low-tech books.
[end of dialog]
We begin the dialog with “Kindo” (his real name!) asking “Nookie,” which perhaps is a nickname, “What's that?” Nookie says, “It's my new e-book reader.” An e-book reader is a small electronic device, usually that you can hold in your hands, that has electronic books. Examples would be the Kindle, the Nook, the iPad, using the iBook software – all of these would be current examples of e-book readers, although the iPad is more than an e-book reader. That's what Nookie has.
Hey, maybe Nookie is related to “Nook” and “Kindo” is related to Kindle. Ahh…see, our Dr. Tse is very clever!
Anyway, Nookie says, “I'm just downloading some new books on to it.” “To download” means to transfer information from the Internet to your computer, or your phone, or whatever it is that you have. Nookie is downloading some books onto the new device. Kindo says, “I haven't bought one yet. I'm old school. I still prefer a printed book.” The expression “old school” means old-fashioned, preferring things from a long time ago. This is also a very common expression nowadays, when people are talking about the way they may do things. They may do them the way they used to be done many years ago, or it could be used to describe, as I think was one of the original uses, music. “I like old-school music from the 70’s and the 80’s.”
In our dialog, Kindo is “old school.” He says he prefers a “printed book.” A “printed book” would be a book on physical paper. The idea is that he likes doing things the way we used to do them. Nookie says, “But if you haven't tried it yet, how do you know you won't like it better? This e-book reader can store over 10,000 digital books.” “To store” (store) here, as a verb, means to keep something so that you can use it in the future. For electronics, for computers, “to store” means to have something on your permanent memory in your computer.
“Digital” (digital) refers to electronic information – things that are stored on the hard drive of a computer, for example, things that are stored typically in what is called “binary (binary) code” – with zeros and ones. Nookie says that her e-book reader can store over 10,000 digital books and it's “easily portable.” “To be portable” (portable) means that you can move it from one place to another. You can pick it up and move it to another place without any difficulty. Nookie says, “Imagine” – or try to imagine, try to think about – “trying to carry an entire library from place to place.” Nookie is saying that the e-book reader that she has is like having an entire library in your pocket, an entire library that you can carry from one place to another.
Kindo says, “I don't usually read 10,000 books all at once,” meaning I don't read 10,000 books at the same time. So, Kindo is suggesting here, perhaps, that's not such a big advantage. He also says that there are a lot of “incompatible formats” out there. “To be incompatible” (incompatible) means that you are not able to get along with, or you are not able to use one thing with another. When we talk about physical things, “incompatible” means that you can't use this thing with that thing. “Format” just refers to the way that a certain piece of information, in this case, an electronic book, is created and stored. It's the form that that particular piece of information takes. So, for example, if you have a Kindle e-reader, you use something called .MOBI, or least that's one of the formats that can be used. Microsoft Word is another format. PDF is a format. These are ways of transmitting information.
If you have “incompatible formats,” you have a file, an electronic piece of information, that can't be used with certain things. They're incompatible. They can't be used together. So, Kindo says that “Each company is trying to edge out the others by establishing their format as the format.” “To edge (edge) out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to try to push someone else out of a competition or to eliminate someone from a certain competition. In this case, it's the competition for consumers. “One company edges out another” is another way of saying one company is more successful than the other. One company is able to be the number one company in that particular area. In this case, we're talking about e-book readers.
Kindo says that “Each company is trying to edge out the others” – the other companies – “by establishing” – or by creating and trying to get other people to follow – “their format as the format,” meaning the only one that people should use. Kindo says, “I think I'll just wait until the dust settles.” “To wait until the dust settles” means that you have a situation where things are changing very quickly and they're going to continue to change, so that it doesn't make any sense for you to try to make a decision now. Just wait until things calm down. Wait until all of the changes are completed and then you can decide what to do. That's what Kindo is recommending. He’s going to wait until the “dust settles,” wait until we know which format of e-books will be the winner in this competition.
Nookie says, “The different formats aren't that big a deal.” They’re not that important. “You can easily convert a book in one format to another,” or another format. “To convert” means to change something so that you transform it in some way so as to allow you to use it, in this case, on a different e-reader.
But Kindo says, “I like the look of text” – or printed words – “on a printed page,” on paper page. Nookie says, “You mean that faded text on that yellowed page?” When text, when printed words on a piece of paper, become “faded,” they’re more difficult to see. They’re more difficult to read. Over time, of course, if you have something in the sun or out in the rain and then later you try to read it, it might be more difficult because the text has faded. It is no longer the same easy to see color that it used to be.
“Yellowed” simply means changing in color from, in this case, white paper to slightly yellow paper. You know how you have an old book and you open it up and it might be 50 years old? Sometimes you'll see that the paper has become a different color, like a yellow color. That's where this word “yellowed” comes from, as an adjective – a page that is yellow.
Nookie says, “On an e-book reader, you can adjust the text size, font, and even line spacing.” Nookie is giving the advantages of an e-book reader. She's saying you can adjust the “text size” – that's how big the letters are - “the font” – that's the form of the letter. There are different fonts you can use – and “line spacing.” “Line spacing” is the amount of space between one line of text and another line of text.
Kindo says, “Can I get all of the out-of-print books on my shelves in digital format?” Books that are “out-of-print” are books that are no longer being made, books that you can no longer buy new. “Out-of-print books” are books the companies have stopped printing, have stopped making.
Kindo asked Nookie a good question, whether the books that he owns that are out-of-print are available for an e-reader, are available in electronic format, or as he says, a “digital format.” Nookie says, “Well, I'm not sure.” Kindo says, “Until I can” – meaning until I am able to read all of my old books on an e-book reader” – I'll stick to” – or I will stay with – “my low-tech books.” “Low (low) – tech (tech)” is a term referring to “low technology” – technology that is very old, that is very simple, that has, perhaps been around for a long time. If you think of books, paper books, as a type of technology, then we’re talking about “low-tech,” something that doesn't require electronics or computers or anything like that. The opposite of low-tech would be “hi-tech.” “Hi-tech” would be the most sophisticated, advanced computers and other electronic equipment that are now available.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Kindo: What’s that?
Nookie: It’s my new e-book reader. I’m just downloading some new books onto it.
Kindo: I haven’t bought one yet. I’m old school. I still prefer a printed book.
Nookie: But if you haven’t tried it yet, how do you know you wouldn’t like it better? This e-book reader can store over 10,000 digital books and it’s easily portable. Imagine trying to carry an entire library from place to place.

Web Fiction
“Web fiction” describes a type of literature that is available only online—not “in print” (as a physical book or magazine and not as an ebook. Web fiction is most often published as a “serial” (a story made of many parts, each published at a different time). The individual “installments” (parts of a story) are rarely “compiled into” (put together as a whole) a single publication like an ebook.
A lot of web fiction is “interactive” (involving the participation of others) and readers are invited to contribute to the story. One of the earliest and most popular pieces of web fiction was “The Spot,” which was published online from 1995 to 1997. “The Spot” was an online show with many actors, and some of their “characters” (the roles the actors were portraying) “kept” (regularly wrote in) online diaries. “Fans” (people who liked the story) could give advice to the characters for dealing with certain situations. And sometimes the viewers’ advice helped to “shape” (change the direction of) the “storyline” (plot).
Most of the web fiction serials use more than simple text to “convey” (communicate) their stories. For example, web fiction might use pop-up windows to provide additional information about characters, short video “clips” (excerpts from a longer video), and interactive maps.
Web fiction “spawned” (created; led to the development of) blogs, and web fiction fans continue to “innovate” (do new and creative things). For example, some web fiction serials are now shared via Twitter and Facebook rather than a simple, independent website.
Most authors don’t “make” (earn) much money with web fiction, although some of them use online “tip jars” (requests for donations) and advertising to try to cover the costs of maintaining their series.
