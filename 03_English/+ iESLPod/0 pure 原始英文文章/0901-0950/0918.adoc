This episode is a dialogue between Lilly and Paul about getting ready for something disastrous, something very bad that might happen in the future. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Lilly: Quick, we need to go get some supplies. I was listening to talk radio on my way home from work, and this guy was on talking about how doomsday is coming and we need to prepare.
Paul: Oh no, not this again. You have to stop listening to that garbage on the radio. Listen, there is no impending doom, and this guy was just crying wolf.
Lilly: No, he wasn’t. He had proof that the world is going to end soon and he was sounding the alarm. Those people killed in the storm last week? They were the canaries in the coal mine. Disaster is coming!
Paul: Let me be the voice of reason for a minute. How many times have you believed that the world was ending in the past few years?
Lilly: A few times, but this is for real. There’ll be a disruption of services, a run on food and water, and chaos!
Paul: Let me ask you this: if the world is ending, aren’t we all just going to die?
Lilly: Not if you have an underground bunker. Start digging!
[end of dialogue]
Lilly begins our dialogue by saying to Paul, “Quick” – meaning do this quickly – “we need to go get some supplies.” “Supplies” are materials you use to do something else. Lilly says, “I was listening to talk radio on my way home from work and this guy” – this man – “was on” – was on the radio – “talking about how doomsday is coming and we need to prepare.” So, Lilly was driving home from work, and she was listening to “talk radio.” “Talk radio” refers to radio programs that don't have music but have people who are being interviewed or people who are talking, usually giving their opinions about something. In the United States, in the last 30 years or so, talk radio has become very popular, especially for political people – people who have strong political opinions, whether they're conservative or liberal. You can find a talk radio station that has mostly people who are on there talking about their political views. Many people associate talk radio, also, with not being very reliable, with having people on there who have very extreme views – views or opinions about things that are not ones that the majority of people would have.
This is what has happened to Lilly. She was listening to talk radio and some man, some guy, was on the radio – was on the radio program – talking about “doomsday.” “Doomsday” (doomsday) is the word we give for the day that the world will end. At some point in our future, something bad will happen and we will all die – the entire human race will die. That will be the “doomsday.” “Doom” (doom) is something bad – death, destruction.
Paul says, “Oh no, not this again.” That expression, “not this again,” means or implies that this is not the first time that Lilly has had this idea or has had a strange idea. Paul says, “You have to stop listening to that garbage on the radio.” “Garbage” (garbage) normally refers to something that is worthless, something that has no value. We might also use the word “trash.” In other English-speaking countries, they use the term “rubbish” (rubbish). In the U.S., we use more commonly the word “garbage.” Paul is referring here to things that are not worth listening to. He's talking about the garbage on the radio. He means that the people who are on there are idiots, that they're saying stupid things. Paul says, “Listen, there is no impending doom, and this guy was just crying wolf.” “Impending” (impending) is something that will happen soon, usually something negative that will happen soon. Paul is saying that there is no impending doom. There is nothing bad that is about to happen.
He says, “This guy was just crying wolf.” The expression “to cry (cry) wolf (wolf)” refers to an old story about the boy who cried wolf. This might even be one of the stories from Aesop, from the ancient world, from ancient Greece. “To cry wolf” means to refer to or to say that something bad is going to happen as a joke, as a trick. If you cry wolf, you are saying something bad is going to happen even when you know that it's not true.
In the original story, the boy was out to protect the sheep and other animals. If the boy saw a wolf, he was supposed to yell very loudly – to cry, which means here to yell very loudly – “Wolf!” so that all of the other adults would come and kill the wolf and protect the sheep. Well, the boy was lonely and wanted some attention. So, he cried wolf even though there was no wolf, and of course all the people came running. Well, he did this once. He did it twice. The third time he did it, there really was a wolf, but no one believed him – no one came running – because he had already cried wolf twice and it was just a joke. It was something that wasn't true.
The general idea, then, of this expression is that if you say something is true and it’s not, and you keep doing that, eventually people will not believe you. That's what Paul is saying that the guy on talk radio is doing. He's crying wolf. He's saying something bad will happen when he knows that there is nothing bad that will happen.
Lilly says, “No, he wasn't. He had proof that the world is going to end soon.” “Proof” (proof) is evidence. It's something that tells you something is true. Lilly says the man “was sounding the alarm.” “To sound the alarm” means to warn people about some danger, about some problem. Lilly says, “Those people killed in the storm last week? They were the canaries in the coal mine.”
This is another expression that refers to an old concept. A “canary” is a kind of bird. “Coal” (coal) is a very hard, black substance that you dig out of the ground to use as fuel, to use for energy. A “mine” (mine) is when you dig holes in the ground to get coal or some other object that is inside of the earth. In the old days, they used to put a canary inside of a coal mine, because if the canary smelled gas the canary would die, and that would be an early indicator that there was a problem – that there was gas and that the men who were working in the coal mine should leave. So, the canary was like a warning sign, a warning system that told you that there was a problem.
Lilly is saying that the people who were killed in this storm in the story last week were canaries in the coal mine. They were indicating that there was a greater danger to the rest of us. She says, “Disaster is coming.” “Disaster” is something horrible, something very bad that is going to hurt or kill many people. Sometimes, we use disaster to refer to something that's really bad – a very bad situation or even a very bad movie. If you say, “That movie was a disaster,” you mean it was a very poorly made movie, not a good movie at all.
Paul says, “Let me be the voice of reason for a minute.” “The voice of reason” is the person who is calm, the person who is logical. Paul says, “How many times have you believed that the world was ending in the past few years?” Paul is asking Lilly how many times she has had this idea that the world was going to end soon. Lilly says, “A few times, but this is for real.” This is actually going to happen, she says.
Lilly says that there will be “a disruption of services, a run on food and water, and chaos.” A “disruption” (disruption) is an interruption in something, a temporary stop of something. In this case, it will be a disruption of services, which might refer to electricity, or water, or transportation – anything required for us to survive. The expression “a run on something” refers to a situation where everyone goes out and tries to buy the same kind of thing. So, if there's going to be a lot of rain, there might be a run on umbrellas. “Umbrellas” are things we use to protect ourselves from the rain. Everyone is going to go out and try to buy umbrellas. There's going to be a run on umbrellas. “Chaos” (chaos) is a general word referring to lack of order. We might even use the word “disorder,” a situation where no one is in control, where the world is without any sort of authority, everything is going wrong, and there is no one there to take care of it.
Paul says, “Let me ask you this: if the world is ending, aren't we all just going to die?” Paul is asking why they should do anything if the world is going to end. There's nothing we can do to stop it. Lilly, however, doesn't agree. She says, “Not if you have an underground bunker.” Lilly is saying that we won't die if we dig a big hole in the ground and hide under the ground in a protected room. That's what an “underground bunker” (bunker) is. Lilly ends by saying, “Start digging!” “To dig” (dig) means to use usually a tool called a “shovel” that removes dirt and allows you to create a hole in the ground. Lilly is telling Paul to start digging into the ground so they can create this underground bunker. There are actually people in the United States who believe that they have to have that kind of protection, and they make their own bunkers. I don't know anyone personally who's done that, but I have read stories about it and heard about it on talk radio.
Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

What Else Does It Mean?
for real
The phrase “for real,” in this podcast, means actually happening, not imaginary or pretend: “When Jeremiah asked Bekka to marry him, she didn’t think it was for real.” The phrase “real life” means reality: “Falling in love is so beautiful in the movies, but it’s never like that in real life.” The phrase “get real” is used to tell another person to stop acting silly and take something seriously: “Do you really think anyone will buy your car for that much money? Get real!” Finally, the phrase “keep in real” means to behave honestly, not pretending to be different from how one really is: “High school students face a lot of peer pressure that makes it hard to keep it real.”
to dig
In this podcast, the verb “to dig” means to excavate, or to use tools to move earth away from an area to create a hole in the ground: “Ahmed spent last weekend digging holes for the fence posts.” The phrase “to dig it” is an older term that means to understand something and find it acceptable: “So that’s our plan. Can you dig it?” The phrase “to dig (one’s) heels in” means to be very stubborn and not do what other people want one to do: “The more her parents tried to get her to change her mind, the more she dug her heels in.” Finally, the phrase “to dig a hole for (oneself)” means to do or say the wrong thing and end up in a difficult situation: “Anyone who complains about a previous boss during a job interview is just digging a hole for himself.”
Culture Note
The Emergency Broadcast System
The Emergency Broadcast System (now officially known as the Emergency Alert System) is a system for “issuing” (sending) “warnings” (statements of bad things that might happen) to the “general public” (ordinary people; all people) in the United States during an emergency. The system was designed to be used in times of war, but it is more often used for “natural disasters” like “severe” (extreme; very strong) weather.
Most people are familiar with the Emergency Broadcast System because they have heard the “alerts” (notifications designed to get people’s attention) on the radio or seen them on TV. There is usually an unpleasant, “high-pitched” (with a high voice, like a soprano) “tone” (musical note). Then a voice makes the following announcement, or something similar:
This is a “test” (an attempt to try something and see if it is working correctly) of the Emergency Broadcast System. This is only a test. If this had been an “actual” (real) emergency, you would have been instructed “where to tune in” (which radio station or TV channel to visit) in your area for news and official information."
“Critics” (people who do not like something) sometimes argued that the Emergency Broadcast System was “ineffective” (not good at doing something) because it gave people a “false sense of security” (the incorrect belief that one is safe). They said that radio and television “broadcasters” (the people responsible for sharing radio and TV shows with the public) wouldn’t know what to do in an actual emergency, and instead needed greater training and more detailed instructions.
