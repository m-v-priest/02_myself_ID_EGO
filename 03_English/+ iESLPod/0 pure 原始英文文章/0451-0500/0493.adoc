This episode is a dialogue between someone who works at a “sandwich shop,” a restaurant that sells sandwiches, and a customer named Jared. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Employee: Welcome to Grubway. What can I get for you?
Jared: I’m still deciding. I’m trying to lose weight and I hear that eating a sandwich for lunch every day will help me do that. Do you guys have a BLT or a club?
Employee: We don’t have a BLT, but we do have a ham or turkey club.
Jared: Okay, I’ll take the club.
Employee: Ham or turkey?
Jared: Can I get half and half, or better yet, can I get double ham and double turkey?
Employee: Sure, no problem.
Jared: I’d like cheese on that, too.
Employee: Would you like your bread toasted and the cheese melted?
Jared: Uh, sure.
Employee: What else would you like on your sandwich, the works?
Jared: What comes with the works?
Employee: It includes lettuce, tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, olives, and pickles, and any spreads, condiments, or seasonings you’d like.
Jared: Oh, okay. I’ll have the works, but hold the pickles and olives. I’d like mayonnaise on the side, too, please. You know what? I’d like to add some chicken to that.
Employee: That’ll be $1.20 additional.
Jared: That’s fine. I’d also like extra cheese, and why don’t you add some roast beef, too?
Employee: Okay, I can do that. Will that be all?
Jared: Yeah, but while you’re at it, throw in two bags of chips and a couple of cookies.
Employee: Okay, I can ring you up down here.
Jared: Hey, tell me, how long before I start losing weight?
Employee: Well, that’s hard to say. You may want to look at the nutritional information chart to determine that.
Jared: Nah, I can already feel the pounds coming off!
[end of dialogue]
Our dialogue begins with the employee at the sandwich shop saying to Jared, the customer, “Welcome to Grubway.” There’s a famous sandwich shop here in the United States called Subway. It’s a chain; that is, there are many different restaurants like this where you can go and order a sandwich. You can either eat it at the restaurant or do what most people do, which is have it “to go,” meaning you take it with you.
The employee asks Jared, “What can I get for you (what kind of sandwich do you want)?” Jared says, “I’m still deciding (I’m still thinking about it),” he says, “I’m trying to lose weight and I hear that eating a sandwich for lunch every day will help me do that.” A few years ago, this chain of sandwich shops, Subway, had a famous commercial where they had one of their customers, whose name was Jared, come on and say that he lost weight because the only thing that he ate for a month or two months, or however long it was, was the Subway sandwiches. So Jared is, in our dialogue, thinking about the same thing. He says, “Do you guys have a BLT or a club?” “Guys,” here, is informal, meaning do you, people who work here. He’s talking to a woman, so we use the term “guys” (plural) to refer often to both men and women, boys and girls together.
A “BLT” is a sandwich with bacon, lettuce, and tomato. BTL – bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich; obviously there’s bread with the sandwich. A “club sandwich” is a sandwich that is made from three slices – three pieces of bread, and two or more different kinds of meat. Usually there’s lettuce and tomatoes and mayonnaise, perhaps other food in there; but it’s three pieces of bread, and then two different types or more of meat inside the sandwich. Usually it’s something like ham or turkey, perhaps chicken.
The employee says, “We don’t have a BLT, but we do have a ham or turkey club. Jared says, “Okay, I’ll take the club,” meaning that’s what I want to order. The employee says, “Ham or turkey?” Jared then says, “Can I get half and half?” “Half and half” means 50 percent of one thing and 50 percent of another. If you’re going to dinner with a vegetarian and you’re going to have, say, pizza, you might say, “Well, let’s get a pizza half and half, half vegetarian and half pepperoni.” I’ll eat the pepperoni side!
Well, Jared wants the sandwich half and half, half turkey half ham, and then he says, “or better yet, can I get double ham and double turkey?” “Double” means twice as much as normal. “Double” has a couple of different meanings however. You can take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations of those additional meanings.
The employee says, “Sure, no problem.” Jared says, “I’d like cheese on that, too.” The employee then asks, “Would you like your bread toasted and the cheese melted?” “To toast bread” means to make it brown and slightly hard; you put it next to a source of high heat, or you put it in a little machine called a “toaster.” “Melted” means that something is solid that becomes more like liquid. If you take a piece of cheese and put on a sandwich and then heat it, the cheese will melt.
Jared says, “Uh, sure. The employee then says, “What else would you like on your sandwich, the works?” When you order a sandwich or a hamburger and somebody asks if you want “the works” – or a hot dog, thinking of fast foods – what they mean is that they will give you everything possible, everything that you could get on the hamburger, sandwich, or hot dog. Well, Jared says, “What comes with the works?” meaning what does that include. The employee says, “It includes lettuce, tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, olives, and pickles, and any spreads, condiments, or seasonings you’d like.” A “spread” is a soft food or a thick liquid that you put on bread in a thin layer. For example, you can use strawberry jelly or strawberry jam; that could be used as a spread. You can make your own spread out of mayonnaise and perhaps some other food and put that on a sandwich. A “condiment” is a powder or a liquid that is added to food to give it more taste. The word “seasonings” is a powder or a dry herb, which is a small plant, that you add to something to give it more flavor. So for example, basil and oregano are two common seasonings in food.
Jared says, “Oh, okay. I’ll have the works,” meaning I want to order a sandwich with everything on it – the works. “But,” he says, “hold the pickles and olives.” When you are ordering food and you use the expression “hold,” such as “hold the pickles,” or “hold the lettuce,” you’re telling the employee – the waiter or waitress that you don’t want have something that is normally part of that dish – that is normally part of that meal. So if you are having, say, a cheeseburger that normally comes with lettuce, you might say, “I want one cheeseburger, hold the lettuce,” meaning don’t give me the lettuce. There was a famous television commercial when I was young, before the Internet was born, that had a song that was part of the commercial, and for some reason I have this weird memory of songs that are part of commercials or television programs, I’m not sure why. Anyway, the song for the commercial, what we would call the “jingle,” was: [Jeff sings]
Hold the pickles, hold the lettuce,
Special orders don’t upset us.
All we ask is that you let us have it your way.
Have it your way,
Have it your way at Burger King.
Thank you! “Have it your way” means you can have your sandwich however you want. It was an advertisement for a hamburger restaurant called Burger King, which is still in existence, although they don’t use that commercial anymore and haven’t since the 1970s.
Jared, continuing on with our story, wants the works, but he wants the pickles and olives held – he wants them to hold the pickles and olives. He says, “I’d like mayonnaise on the side, too, please.” Mayonnaise “on the side,” meaning separated from the rest of the food. If a sandwich normally has mayonnaise or mustard on it, or any other kind of food, you can ask for it “on the side,” especially if it’s a liquid, that’s the most common use of that.
Then Jared says, “You know what? I’d like to add some chicken to that.” The employee says, “That’ll be $1.20 additional,” meaning extra. Jared says, “That’s fine. I’d also like extra cheese, and why don’t you add some roast beef, too?” meaning please add some roast beef, an additional kind of meat. He says, “while you’re at it, throw in two bags of chips and a couple of cookies.” The expression “while you’re at it” is a phrase used to ask someone to continue something they are doing, but do something additional. Since the employee is getting Jared’s food, he says, “well, while you’re at it (since you are doing it anyway), also throw in (meaning include; add) two bags of chips (potato chips) and a couple of cookies.”
Then Jared asks, “how long before I start losing weight?” Well, of course, Jared has added all this extra food to the sandwich, so he probably won’t be losing any weight. The employee says, “that’s hard to say (that’s difficult to determine). You may want to look at the nutritional information chart to determine that.” The “nutritional information” is the information about how many calories, how much fat, how much sodium a food contains.
Jared says, “Nah (meaning ‘no’), I can already feel the pounds coming off!” “To come off” means to, in this case, reduce or become less. So he’s saying he can already feel the pounds, his extra weight in his body, coming off – disappearing. “To come” is used with lots of different prepositions as a phrasal verb; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Employee: Welcome to Grubway. What can I get for you?
Jared: I’m still deciding. I’m trying to lose weight and I hear that eating a sandwich for lunch every day will help me do that. Do you guys have a BLT or a club?
Employee: We don’t have a BLT, but we do have a ham or turkey club.
Jared: Okay, I’ll take a club.
Employee: Ham or turkey?
Jared: Can I get half and half, or better yet, can I get double ham and double turkey?
Employee: Sure, no problem.
Jared: I’d like cheese on that, too.

Culture Note
Americans often eat sandwiches for lunch. One common sandwich is a “submarine sandwich,” usually known as a “sub,” “hoagie,” “grinder,” or another name, depending on what part of the country you are in. A submarine sandwich is made by cutting a long “roll” (a type of bread) of French or Italian bread in half and filling it with meat, cheese, vegetables, and condiments. One popular type of submarine sandwich is a “meatball sub,” where a meatball is a large ball of ground beef that has been flavored with “spices” (seasonings) and covered with tomato sauce. A meatball sub might have three large meatballs and a lot of tomato sauce.
A “Reuben sandwich” is made on toasted rye bread that is filled with “corned beef” (a type of salty beef), cheese, and “Thousand Island dressing” (a thick sauce usually put on green salads).
“Sloppy Joes” are also popular sandwiches, although they are more common at dinnertime than lunchtime. A sloppy Joe is made by cooking “ground beef” (beef in very small pieces, usually used to make hamburgers) in a tomato sauce and then putting it on a “hamburger bun” (the round rolls normally used for hamburgers). The sandwich is called a “sloppy Joe” because it is impossible to eat it without getting “sloppy” (very messy), since the hamburger and sauce falls out as you eat the sandwich.
Finally, the “Philadelphia cheesesteak,” or “Philly cheesesteak,” is a special sandwich that originated in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is made with a long roll like a submarine sandwich, but it is filled with thin slices of “steak” (high-quality beef) that are covered with melted cheese.
