On this episode, we have a dialogue between the Celeste and Anwar about getting things in the mail – the old kind of mail, you know, not email. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Celeste: Did the mail come?
Anwar: Yes, you got some letters and a package.
Celeste: Oh, I hope that one of those envelopes has the photos Naomi promised us. Did you notice the postmark?
Anwar: No, but they’re sitting in the hall.
Celeste: Those photos are overdue and should have been delivered days ago. Naomi thought she might not have put enough postage on the envelope, but I thought it must have been misdelivered.
Anwar: You can look at it yourself. The package you received was sent using overnight delivery.
Celeste: I wonder who sent it and why they sent it using expedited service.
Anwar: I don’t know. Why don’t you go look?
Celeste: I wonder if there’s anything perishable in it or that’s time-sensitive in some way.
Anwar: I have no idea. There’s also a letter that’s been forwarded from our old address that has delivery confirmation.
Celeste: Oh, I wonder what that could be.
Anwar: You know what?
Celeste: What?
Anwar: All of those mysteries can be solved if you just go and open your mail.
Celeste: I know, but isn’t it more fun to speculate?
[end of dialogue]
Celeste begins our dialogue by asking Anwar, “Did the mail come?” Celeste is asking if the mail has arrived, if it has been delivered. Anwar says, “Yes, you got some letters and packages.” A “letter” is usually a piece of paper or several pieces of paper put in an envelope and then is given to the local post office to be delivered to another location – another house or a business.
An “envelope” (envelope) is basically a folded piece of paper that is glued together so that you can put another piece of paper, your letter, inside of it. You can put other things other than letters, pieces of paper with writing on them, in an envelope. You could also put a photograph in an envelope. Anwar says that Celeste got some letters and a package. The word “package” (package) is usually used to describe a box (it could be a small box, it could be a very large box) that is sent, again, through the mail – given to the post office or some other delivery service.
Here in the United States, in addition to the post office, we also have other private companies that will deliver your packages and letters. You have to pay more money, of course, for that to happen. Celeste says, “Oh, I hope one of those envelopes has the photos Naomi promised us.” Here we see the word “envelope” again, and in this case, the envelope has photos in it – or at least, that’s what Celeste hopes is in the envelope. Celeste says , “Did you notice the postmark?”
A “postmark” (postmark) is a little mark, usually made with ink, that is put on the package or the envelope when it is mailed. You put a little piece of paper called a “stamp” on the envelope or the package, and then the post office puts ink on that stamp so that you don’t use the stamp again and so that you know what day the letter or the envelope was processed by the post office in order to be delivered.
In the United States, many times official documents have to be mailed by a certain date, especially things you’re sending to the government. The governmnet doesn’t require that the envelope arrive by a certain date, but rather that it be postmarked by a certain date. So, to pay your income taxes each year, you have to make sure that the envelope is given to the post office and that the post office puts a postmark on it no later than April 15th. We would say the envelope has to be “postmarked” by the 15th of April. So, “postmark” can be used as a verb, or as a noun to refer to the actual mark of ink on the envelope or package.
Celeste is asking Anwar if he noticed the postmark, meaning if he looked at it. Anwar says, “No, but they’re sitting in the hall.” I should mention also that a postmark also usually contains the location of where the letter or package was mailed from – the location of the post office. Celeste says, “Those photos are overdue and should have been delivered days ago.” If something is “overdue” (overdue), it is past the deadline. It is something that should have been submitted or should have arrived earlier.
“To be delivered” means to be given to the person for whom the envelope or the package is intended. Celeste says, “Naomi thought she might not have put enough postage on the envelope, but I thought it must have been misdelivered.” “Postage” (postage) is the amount of money that you have to pay in order to send an envelope or a package. Usually this is done with what are called “postage stamps” (stamps) which are those little pieces of paper, with usually a picture on them of a famous person or of a famous place in your country, that are then placed on the envelope or the package.
Celeste thought the package might have been “misdelivered,” meaning it might have been given to the wrong person by the post office. That happens of course sometimes. Anwar says, “You can look at it yourself. The package you received was sent using overnight delivery.” “Overnight delivery” is when you give a letter or a package to the post office or to another private delivery service, and that package or envelope is delivered the next day. In fact, another word for or term for “overnight delivery” is “next-day delivery,” which is now the more common term.
Celeste says, “I wonder who sent it and why they sent it using expedited service.” The word “expedite” (expedite) means to make something go faster. So, “expedited service” would be delivery service that is faster than normal, faster than usual. Anwar is clearly not interested in answering all of Celeste’s questions. He says, “I don’t know” – I don’t know why they sent it using expedited service. “Why don’t you go look?” meaning stop bothering me and go look at the package yourself. It’s almost certain that Anwar and Celeste are married.
Celeste says, “I wonder if there is anything perishable in it or that’s time-sensitive in some way.” Sometimes you’ll use “expedited service” or “overnight delivery” because you’re sending food that is “perishable” (perishable). Perishable food is food that has to be put in a refrigerator or a freezer, otherwise, it will go bad. It will rot.
Some people send food that is perishable in special packages that have ice in them or some other material that keeps them cold. But, of course, they need to be placed in a refrigerator or freezer as soon as possible. That’s “perishable food” – anything that has to be refrigerated or frozen. The opposite would be “nonperishable food” – food that comes in cans, for example.
Celeste also wonders whether the contents of the package is something that is “time-sensitive.” If something is “time-sensitive,” it is required to be acted upon or to arrive within a very short period of time. Something that’s time-sensitive is something that has to be done right away, or very soon, or by a certain deadline. Again, Anwar isn’t interested in answering Celeste’s questions. He says, “I have no idea. There is also a letter that’s been forwarded from our old address that has delivery confirmation.”
When mail is “forwarded” (forwarded), it is sent to a different address, usually because someone has moved. If you move from one house or apartment to another house or apartment, usually the post office will forward your mail to your new address even though the address on the envelope or package is to your old address, to the house where you used to live. Usually they’ll do that for three or six months. After that, they may or may not, depending on how nice of a post office you have.
“Delivery confirmation” is a special service that the post office provides, as well as other private delivery companies, where the person who is sending the package can check to see if the package has in fact arrived – if it has been delivered. Celeste says, “Oh, I wonder what that could be?” meaning the other letter that had been forwarded. Anwar says, “You know what?” And Celeste responds, “What?” Anwar says, “All of those mysteries can be solved if you just go and open your mail.”
Anwar is getting impatient now with Celeste. He’s telling her to just go and open the mail so she doesn’t have to keep asking questions wondering what’s in the package and the letter. A “mystery” (mystery) is something that you don’t know – something that you want to know, but you don’t have an answer for. We can talk about a “murder mystery,” where you don’t know who killed a certain person.
Celeste says, “I know, but isn’t it more fun to speculate?” She realizes she can have her questions answered by just going and opening these letters and packages, but she thinks it’s “fun to speculate.” “To speculate” (speculate) means to wonder or guess about something without having any real evidence or proof. The noun form would be “speculation.”
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
[start of dialogue]
Celeste: Did the mail come?
Anwar: Yes, you got some letters and a package.
Celeste: Oh, I hope that one of those envelopes has the photos Naomi promised us. Did you notice the postmark?
Anwar: No, but they’re sitting in the hall.
Celeste: Those photos are overdue and should have been delivered days ago. Naomi thought she might not have put enough postage on the envelope, but I thought it must have been misdelivered.
Anwar: You can look at it yourself. The package you received was sent using overnight delivery.
Celeste: I wonder who sent it and why they sent it using expedited service.
Anwar: I don’t know. Why don’t you go look?
Celeste: I wonder if there’s anything perishable in it or that’s time-sensitive in some way.
Anwar: I have no idea. There’s also a letter that’s been forwarded from our old address that has delivery confirmation.
Celeste: Oh, I wonder what that could be.
Anwar: You know what?
Celeste: What?
Anwar: All of those mysteries can be solved if you just go and open your mail.
Celeste: I know, but isn’t it more fun to speculate?

letter

Culture Note
Suspicious Packages
A “suspicious package” is an envelope or package sent through the mail that “raises suspicion” (makes people feel uncomfortable because there seems to be a problem), specifically because it might contain a dangerous chemical or a “bomb” (something that can explode, causing injury or death).
People who work in “mail rooms” (departments that sort a large amount of mail and send letters and packages to the appropriate recipients) are trained to “spot” (find and identify) suspicious packages. They look for oil “stains” (marks) or “discoloration” (spots of a different color) on the envelope, or the use of large amount of tape or string. They also look for packages that smell strange or that have an unusual shape. Other signs of suspicious packages are addresses that hare “handwritten” (not typed) with strange, misspelled addresses, no “return address” (the name and address of the sender), and envelopes with “excessive postage” (far too many stamps). Often the suspicious packages are marked with phrases like “confidential,” “private,” or “for (a certain person’s) eyes only,” meaning that the sender wants only the recipient to open the envelope or package.
People who receive a suspicious package are advised to stop “handling” (touching and moving) the package immediately. They should leave the room or building and call “9-1-1” (the emergency phone number that puts people in touch with the police and other emergency services) as soon as possible. Then the police will send a “bomb squad” (people who are trained to “deactivate” (make inactive) explosive devices) to the site to further evaluate the envelope or package.
