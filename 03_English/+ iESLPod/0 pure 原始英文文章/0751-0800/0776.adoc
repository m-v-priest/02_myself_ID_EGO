This episode is a dialogue between Rene and Bruno about getting praise, when people say good things about you. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Rene: Hey, look who’s here. It’s the company’s golden boy.
Bruno: Very funny.
Rene: I’m not joking. First, you’re recognized at the annual meeting for your work in the company, and then you get a commendation from the city for your volunteer work. I’m basking in your reflected glory.
Bruno: I didn’t ask for either honor, as you well know. I’m not a glory hound.
Rene: Yes, and that’s what makes it even more galling. You don’t have to go seeking your glory; it comes to you.
Bruno: Knock it off! I like praise as much as the next guy, but I’d rather not be in the limelight.
Rene: I know. You’re exceptional and you’re modest about it. You’re the perfect guy. You leave us mere mortals in the dust.
Bruno: I’m leaving. I know you love giving me a hard time, but remember this: I give as good as I get – and I have a long memory!
[end of dialogue]
Our dialogue begins with Rene saying, “Hey, look who’s here.” What happens here is that Bruno is walking into the room, and Rene is talking about Bruno. She’s saying, “Hey, look who’s here.” Look at who has just come into the room. “It’s the company’s golden boy.” The expression “golden boy” refers to someone who’s very successful or gifted or talented that other people admire. Rene is being funny; she’s being sarcastic here; however, she isn’t really praising or saying nice things about Bruno. Bruno understands that; he says, “Very funny,” meaning he knows it’s not funny. Rene says, “I’m not joking. First, you’re recognized at the annual meeting for your work in the company.” “To be recognized” here means that someone says something nice about you, someone compliments you – praises you in public, usually in front of a group of people or in some newspaper or official publication. That’s to be recognized. “To recognize” can also mean that you see someone or something and you remember what it is because you’ve seen it before. But here, it just means to be praised, to be complimented on something.
Rene says, “First, you are recognized at the annual meeting (that is, a meeting for the whole company that happens once a year), then you get a commendation from the city for your volunteer work.” A “commendation” is an official often certificate or a letter that is given someone to thank them for their work. It’s an award that an organization or a government agency or a government organization might give someone for the work that they have done – the good work that they have done. In this case, Bruno has done volunteer work; he has worked without being paid for some group.
Rene says, “I’m basking in your reflected glory.” “To bask” (bask) usually means to sit in the sun so that you can get a tan, or simply for the pleasure of feeling the warmth of the sun. But it’s often used, this verb “to bask,” with the word “glory” to mean to enjoy all of the good things that are happening to you, the praise, the compliments that people are giving you. “I’m going to bask in the glory of my victory.” Everyone is thanking me or congratulating me, looking at me, saying nice things about me. I’m going to bask in that; I’m going to enjoy it. What Rene is saying, however, is a little different. She’s saying, “I’m basking in your reflected glory.” When light hits a mirror, it’s reflected, it goes off of the mirror and back out again. What Rene is saying is that she doesn’t have any glory of her own, no one is praising her, but people are praising Bruno and so she’s enjoying the praise that is reflected from Bruno to her because all of the wonderful things that Bruno has done and has been recognized for. Once again, she’s making a joke here.
Bruno says, “I didn’t ask for either honor, as you well know.” An “honor” (honor) is recognition or praise that you receive, usually from a powerful organization or person. The president may give you an honor, such as giving you an award for something. Bruno says that he didn’t ask for these honors; he didn’t try to get these honors. He says, “I’m not a glory hound.” A “glory hound” (hound) is someone who is always looking for praise, someone who always wants to be recognized, who wants everyone to say nice things about them. Rene says, “Yes,” she understands that Bruno is not a glory hound, “and that’s what makes it even more galling.” Something that is “galling” (galling) is something that is annoying or irritating because it seems unfair. Rene says, “You don’t have to go seeking your glory; it comes to you.”
Bruno says, “Knock it off!” “Knock it off” means stop it; it’s an informal expression that means stop doing what you’re doing. You don’t like it, you want the other person to stop it. A child may be screaming or talking loudly or crying, and the mother may say, “Knock it off,” meaning stop doing that. Bruno says, “Knock it off. I like praise as much as the next guy.” “Praise” is something nice that someone says about you. The expression “as much as the next guy” is used to emphasize that you are normal, that you are just like everyone else, that you are no different than everyone else. He says, “I like praise (I like to be complimented) as much as the next guy (just like everyone else), but I’d rather not be in the limelight.” The “limelight” (limelight – one word) means to have a lot of attention, when everyone is looking on you. It could mean that your picture is in the newspaper, and the television news is talking about you; that’s to be in the limelight
Rene says, “I know. You’re exceptional and you’re modest about it.” “Exceptional” means very good at something, better than anyone else, “extraordinary” we might say. Rene says that Bruno is exceptional and he’s modest about it. “To be modest” (modest) means to be humble, not to talk to other people about it. Here, “to be modest” means to be good, but not to talk about it to everyone else. Rene says, “You’re the perfect guy. You leave us mere mortals in the dust.” A “mortal” (mortal) is someone who will die, all of us human beings are mortal, but the expression “mere mortals” means ordinary people, people who aren’t extraordinary, who are not exceptional. “To leave (someone) in the dust” means to beat another person in a competition, to be superior to someone else, to win in such a way that the other person is not even close to you. Rene says to Bruno that he leaves mere mortals – us mere mortals the dust, he is much better than the rest of us.
Bruno says, “I’m leaving. I know you love giving me a hard time.” “To give (someone) a hard time” means to criticize someone, usually by making fun of them. Bruno says, “remember this: I give as good as I get.” The expression “to give as good as you get” means I can criticize jokingly, I can tease (tease) you just as much as you tease me – as you make fun of me, as you criticize me. “And,” Bruno says, “I have a long memory!” “To have a long memory” means that you will remember things for a long time. Wives have very long memories, they will remember things that you said and did years and years ago. All husbands know this!
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
[start of dialogue]
Rene: Hey, look who’s here. It’s the company’s golden boy.
Bruno: Very funny.
Rene: I’m not joking. First, you’re recognized at the annual meeting for your work in the company, and then you get a commendation from the city for your volunteer work. I’m basking in your reflected glory.
Bruno: I didn’t ask for either honor, as you well know. I’m not a glory hound.
Rene: Yes, and that’s what makes it even more galling. You don’t have to go seeking your glory; it comes to you.
Bruno: Knock it off! I like praise as much as the next guy, but I’d rather not be in the limelight.
Rene: I know. You’re exceptional and you’re modest about it. You’re the perfect guy. You leave us mere mortals in the dust.
Bruno: I’m leaving. I know you love giving me a hard time, but remember this: I give as good as I get – and I have a long memory!

in the dust

Culture Note
Employee Recognition
Many American employers have special “employee recognition” or “employee appreciation” programs in which they try to recognize their best employees for their contributions to the company.
Many companies “name” (recognize someone as) an Employee of the Month. They might have a “plaque” (a piece of wood hung on a wall to display small pieces of metal with written text) where they list all the Employees of the Month with their name and date, and possibly a photograph.
Some employee recognition programs offer awards. For example, an Employee of the Month might receive a small “monetary award” (money), a hat with the “company logo” (a small image that represents the company), or a “gift certificate” (a card or piece of paper that allows someone to spend a certain amount of money at a particular store or restaurant). Other companies might let their Employee of the Month use a special parking space close to the front door.
Other companies prefer to recognize employees for specific accomplishments. For example, a sales department might recognize the salesperson with the highest sales over a certain period of time. Other companies might “solicit” (request) “cost-reduction” (ways to lower the company’s expenses) suggestions from their employees and “issue” (make; create; give) a special award for employees whose suggestions are “implemented” or used, and save the company money.
Employee recognition programs can be a good way to “motivate” (make someone want to do something more or better) employees, but they can “backfire” (do the opposite of what they were intended to do) if employees “perceive” (believe; get the impression that) the awards are awarded unfairly.
