Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 770: Joining a Tour.
This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 770. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Joining a Tour.” We’re going to be taking a trip – a vacation, and we’re going to be going with a group of other people. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Darrel: What are you looking at?
Alice: Tours for our vacation. I was thinking that it’d be hard for us to get around on our own, so I think joining a tour is a good idea.
Darrel: Really? I thought we’d make our way around leisurely to see the sites. I don’t like the fast pace of tours. I’d rather have the time to take in each site, not rush through it just to say I’ve been there.
Alice: Tours come in all shapes and sizes. I’m sure we can find one that isn’t too fast-paced or strenuous for you.
Darrel: And I don’t want to eat all my meals with the tour group. I want some time to explore on our own.
Alice: All right, I’m looking at a tour that has the perfect itinerary. It’s also gotten rave reviews. It includes a tour guide, all admission fees, accommodations, ground transportation, and most of the meals. And there are several free mornings and afternoons built-in so we can explore on our own.
Darrel: I don’t know.
Alice: The alternative is for you to plan each stop of our trip.
Darrel: A tour is sounding better and better.
[end of dialogue]
Darrel begins by saying to Alice, “What are you looking at?” Alice says, “Tours for our vacation.” A “tour” (tour) is an organized journey to see a city or a place, usually it’s with a group of people, and there is someone leading the tour called the “tour guide.” Alice is looking for tours for her and Darrel’s vacation. She says, “I was thinking that it’d be hard for us to get around on our own,” meaning it would be difficult for us to go to this place, wherever they’re going, by themselves, “so I think joining a tour is a good idea,” signing up, paying and becoming a member of this group that will travel together.
Darrel says, “Really? I thought we’d make our way around leisurely to see the sites.” “To make our way around” means to go by yourself, not with another group, to find out the interesting things, to look at things by yourself; you don’t have anyone helping you. “Leisurely” (leisurely) is an adverb meaning slowly, in a very calm and relaxed, enjoyable way. The “sites” (sites) are places that you go to visit: it could be a famous building, it could be a beautiful park, it might to be a museum, anything that you would go as a tourist – as someone visiting another place – to see. That would be called a “site.” Darrel says he doesn’t like the fast pace of tours. The “pace” (pace) is the speed, how fast or how slow something goes. I can talk at a fast pace or I can talk at a slow pace. I can walk at a fast pace or walk at a slow pace. Darrel says, “I’d rather have the time to take in each site, not rush through it just to say I’ve been there.” “To take in” means to look at, to experience, to appreciate something. If you come to Los Angeles I would tell you to go and drive up along the ocean and take in the beautiful views – the beautiful scenery, the things that you can see: the ocean and so forth. Well Darrel says he wants time to take in each site – each place they visit, not rush through it just to say he’s been there. “To rush through (something)” is to do something very quickly, usually without enough time to do it well. He doesn’t want to go from one place to another place just to say that he was at those places, he wants to actually stop and enjoy them.
Alice says, “Tours come in all shapes and sizes.” The expression “to come in all shapes and sizes” means that there is a wide variety of options, a lot of different types, a lot of different ways that tours can be organized; they’re not all the same. Alice says, “I’m sure we can find one that isn’t (that is not) too fast-paced or strenuous for you.” When we say is something is “strenuous” (strenuous) we mean it’s difficult, it requires a lot of perhaps physical work or mental concentration. It’s a lot of work. Usually it’s used when we talk about physical work, like lifting heavy boxes for example. Alice thinks she can find a tour that isn’t too strenuous for Darrel.
Darrel says, “And I don’t want to eat all my meals with the tour group.” Your “meals” are your breakfast, your lunch, and your dinner. It’s often the case that on a tour you go to a restaurant and everyone eats together. Darrel doesn’t want to do that; he says, “I want some time to explore on our own.” “To explore” means to go to someplace you’ve never been before to try to learn new things, to discover new things. Darrel says he wants to explore. Alice says, “All right, I’m looking at a tour that has the perfect itinerary.” “Itinerary” is a planned scheduled for a trip. It shows exactly what you are going to be doing: first you get up at 8:00, then you eat breakfast, your bus leaves at 11:00, you arrive at the museum at 1:00, and so on. That’s an itinerary. Alice says this tour has gotten, or has received, rave reviews. “Rave reviews” are when people say that something is very wonderful; it’s excellent. You may, for example, be thinking of going to a restaurant, so you go online and you look at the reviews, what other people say about that restaurant. If they are saying they’re wonderful, then we say they are “rave (rave) reviews.” “Rave” has a couple of different meanings in English, however; take a look at our Learning Guide for some of those.
Alice says that this tour she found includes a tour guide (remember that’s the person who is the leader of the tour), all admission fees, accommodations, ground transportation, and most of our meals. An “admission fee” is the amount of money that you pay to get into a museum or to get into some famous historical site. The word “fee” (fee) is price. “Admission” is to get into something, to enter into something, or to become part of something. “Accommodations” is another word for the place where you are going to sleep at night; we sometimes called this “lodging” (lodging). “Lodging” and “accommodations” mean the same thing, it’s your hotel or whatever place you are staying at and sleeping at. “Ground transportation” refers to how you get from one place to another by car, bus, train, subway, anything that travels on the ground. It does not include air travel; we’re not talking about airplanes. But, we’re talking about all the other ways that you can travel without leaving the ground.
Alice says, “there are several free mornings,” meaning mornings that you don’t have anything planned, that you can do what you want, “and afternoons.” These free mornings and afternoons are built-in so they can explore on their own. When we say something is “built-in” we mean it’s included as part of the plan – as part of the itinerary. “We are planning that on the second day in the afternoon we won’t have any activities, you can do whatever you want.” That’s why Alice says they are built-in; they are part of the plan.
Darrel is not sure; he says, “I don’t know.” Alice says, “The alternative is for you to plan each stop of our trip.” The “alternative” means the other option or another way we can do this. She says the alternative is for Darrel to plan each stop – each day, each thing you do each day – for their trip. Darrel says, “A tour is sounding better and better.” Now that he has the option of doing everything himself or taking a tour, now he’s more interested in taking the tour!
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal pace.

Culture Note
Popular Family Vacation Destinations
U.S. News and World Report, a national newspaper, has created a list of the 15 best family vacation “destinations” (places to go) in the United States. Here are some of the “highlights” (most interesting or most important parts).
According to the report, the “top” (best; #1) destination for a family vacation is the Grand “Canyon” (a very deep, narrow valley cut into rocks or mountains by a river) in Arizona. The report “notes” (comments; mentions) that the Grand Canyon has many “natural attractions” (pieces of nature that are interesting to see), a railway, hiking, rafting, “kayaking” (a boat like a small canoe), and many restaurants.
The report’s second choice is Yosemite, a national park in California. Like the Grand Canyon, Yosemite offers “an abundance of” (many) natural attractions and outdoor activities. Yosemite is also “relatively” (pretty; fairly) close to San Francisco, where families can enjoy the “sights and sounds” (exciting aspects; interesting parts) of a large city.
The third destination on the list is Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. Disney World is a “theme park” (a large, outdoor area for entertainment, organized and designed around a theme) related to the Disney characters like Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. Disney World has many “rides” (large machines people sit in that move around for entertainment) and other “attractions” (things of interest) that are appropriate “for the entire family” (for people of all ages), as well as plenty of hotels, restaurants and swimming pools. Disney World “bills itself as” (calls itself; is marketed as) the happiest place on earth.
