This episode is called “Going on a Cruise.” It’s an episode that has a dialogue between Connie and Robert using vocabulary you would use if you went on a big ship going on a vacation, which is what a cruise is. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Connie: I’m so excited! We’re finally taking a cruise. Are you sure this is the embarkation area?
Robert: Yes, I’m sure. We go on board right here, see? Come on, let’s find our cabin.
Connie: Okay, but I want to go up on deck as soon as possible and look around the entire ship. Do you think they’ll let us go on the bridge and meet the captain?
Robert: I don’t think so. You know, I think we’re going the wrong way. I can’t find our cabin number.
Connie: Let’s see if we can find the purser or a steward to help us. Oh, never mind, here it is! Wow, this cabin is really small.
Robert: No worries. We won’t be spending much time in the cabin. When do we eat?
Connie: We can go down to the buffet right now for lunch, and I put us down for the main seating at 7:00 for dinner.
Robert: Whoa, what’s that?!
Connie: That’s the ship setting sail. You’re not going to be seasick, are you?
Robert: I don’t think so, but I’m really looking forward to our first port of call!

Connie begins our dialogue by saying, “I’m so excited! We’re finally taking a cruise,” a vacation where you eat, sleep and are entertained in a very large ship. Here in Los Angeles, you can take a cruise down to Mexico, you can take a cruise up to Alaska, you can take a cruise to South America or to Hawaii; all of these are places where you can go on a cruise. I’ve been on a cruise once, it was the worst experience of my life as a vacation. But, hey, doesn’t mean you will have a bad time! Connie says, “Are you sure this is the embarkation area?” “Embarkation” is when you get on the ship; it’s the process of getting on the ship when you first get to the ship. You park your car, or you get out of your taxi, and then you walk onto the ship; that’s the embarkation.
Robert says, “Yes, I’m sure. We go on board right here, see?” “To go on board” means to be on the ship, or it could mean on a boat, but here it means the big cruise ship. Robert says, “Come on, let’s find our cabin.” Your “cabin” is your little room (and I do mean little room – small, very small) where you sleep.
Connie says, “Okay, but I want to go up on deck as soon as possible.” “To go on deck” means to be on top of the ship. It’s a large, flat top of the ship. There’s nothing above you in other words – there’s no roof, no ceiling. By the way, “cabin” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations of that word and our next word, which is “bridge.” Connie says she wants to look around the entire ship and asks, “Do you think they’ll let us go on the bridge and meet the captain?” On a large ship, the “bridge” is the highest part of the ship, usually, where people are, and these are the people who control the ship; they control its speed and direction. That’s where you would find the captain. So, the captain is on the bridge; notice we don’t say “in the bridge,” we say “on the bridge.” The “captain” is, of course, the leader of the people who work on the ship – the person who is in charge, who’s the boss.
Robert says, “I don’t think so,” I don’t think we can meet the captain. “You know,” he says, “I think we’re going the wrong way. I can’t find our cabin number.” Connie says, “Let’s see if we can find the purser or a steward to help us.” On a ship – on a cruise ship, the “purser” (purser) is the person who works on the ship and whose job it is to help you have a good time and to make you more comfortable. Usually, the purser is assigned a certain number of cabins. In other words, they’re responsible for everyone in, say, these 20 cabins. The “steward” is the person who brings food and drink to people in their cabins. On American cruise ships, you usually can eat as much as you want; they have buffet lunches, dinners, and breakfast. On many cruise ships you can also order food; you can have food delivered to your little room (your cabin) for free. It’s not good food, but they definitely deliver it!
So Connie says, “Oh, never mind, here it is!” meaning she’s found their cabin. “Never mind” means what I said before isn’t important or is no longer important, don’t worry about it. She doesn’t need to find the purser and the steward in other words, because she found her cabin. And what does she say when she sees her cabin? “Wow, this cabin is really small.” She should have asked me, I could have told her!
Robert says, “No worries.” The expression “no worries” has become popular a lot in the last 10-15 years in the United States. It means no problem, there is nothing to worry about, or simply don’t worry about it. Robert says, “We won’t be spending much time in the cabin (we won’t be here very much). When do we eat?” That’s a good question, because that’s pretty much all you do on a cruise ship. You eat and eat and eat, and watch other people eat!
Connie says, “We can go down to the buffet right now for lunch.” The “buffet” is, you may know, a style of eating where you have a long table and you put all the food on the table, and everyone comes and takes as much food as they want typically. Connie says, “I put us down for the main seating at 7:00 for dinner.” Because there are so many people on a cruise ship, they assign you (or give you) a time when you can come and eat, if you are going to eat in the dinning room, in the main area where people eat.
Connie says she put her and her husband down for the main seating at 7:00 for dinner. “To put them down” means to sign them up, oddly enough it means the same. “To put us down” means to write our name down or to say that’s when we want to do something. Or if you’re volunteering for something, you would put your name on a list for example. The expression “put me down” can also used when, for example, someone is selling something to you and you need to order it, and then they’ll go and get it. You might use this expression, for example, if my niece is selling cookies for her Girl Scout troop (group of girls that get together and – I don’t know what they do). Anyway, you would say perhaps, “Put me down for three boxes of mints,” a type of chocolate cookie. But here, Connie means that she simply signed them up, or wrote their name down, for the main seating. “Seating,” here, means the time that you go into a restaurant and sit down to eat. As I said before, on a cruise ship they have different times – different seatings for each meal because there are too many people on the ship for everyone to fit; there’s no room in the dining room for everyone at the same time.
Robert says, “Whoa, what’s that?!” “Whoa” means I’m surprised; I’m, perhaps, scared. Connie says, “That’s the ship setting sail.” “To set sail” is for a boat to leave the land and go out into the water. Connie says, “You’re not going to be seasick, are you?” “To be seasick” is a type of motion sickness when you are on the water in a ship; you feel nauseous, your stomach doesn’t feel good, you feel dizzy, and so forth. Some people take special pills to prevent them from being seasick. I got seasick when I went on a cruise, even though I took the pills. So, doesn’t help me – but I’m sure you’ll have a good time!
Robert says, “I don’t think so (I don’t think I’m getting seasick), but,” he says, “I’m really looking forward to our first port of call!” Your “port of call” is a place where the cruise ship stops, usually for a short period, but it could be overnight or more. It allows you to get off the ship and to visit the place where it is stopped, and then you go back on the ship, and then you go somewhere else. If you take a cruise ship around the Mediterranean, the sea between Africa and Europe, you could go to many different ports of call – many different places you could stop and visit.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue at a normal speed.
[start of dialogue]
Connie: I’m so excited! We’re finally taking a cruise. Are you sure this is the embarkation area?
Robert: Yes, I’m sure. We go on board right here, see? Come on, let’s find our cabin.
Connie: Okay, but I want to go up on deck as soon as possible and look around the entire ship. Do you think they’ll let us go up on the bridge and meet the captain?
Robert: I don’t think so. You know, I think we’re going the wrong way. I can’t find our cabin number.

What Else Does It Mean?
cabin
The word “cabin,” in this podcast, refers to a small room where one sleeps on a large ship: “There was so much to do on the ship that they were in their cabin only to sleep.” A “cabin” is also a small wooden home in the mountains or in a forest, usually used for vacation: “They rented a cabin in the woods where they could spend all day in nature.” Or, “Little House on the Prairie is a book about a little girl who grew up in a log cabin.” On an airplane, a “cabin” is one part of a plane: “Have you ever sat in the first-class cabin?” Or, “There were too many screaming children in our cabin of the plane.”
bridge
In this podcast, the word “bridge” means the part of a large ship that is higher than the rest of the ship, where people work to control the ship’s speed and direction: “We were scared when we saw the frightened captain running toward the bridge.” Normally a “bridge” is the part of a road that goes over a river: “Drive over the bridge and then turn left.” The “bridge of (one’s) nose” is the top part of one’s nose, between one’s eyes: “Her glasses always slide down the bridge of her nose.” “Bridge” is also a challenging card game played by four people: “Do you prefer playing bridge or poker?” Finally, a “bridge” is a tiny piece of metal that holds an artificial tooth next to a real tooth: “The dentist says I need two bridges.”
Culture Note
Many Americans enjoy going on vacation cruises. Cruises are usually “all-inclusive packages,” meaning that everything is included. The lodging, meals, and entertainments are included in the price, so people only have to pay for airfare and alcohol once they’ve paid for the cruise.
Many single adults and couples enjoy going on “luxury cruises,” where everything is very comfortable and pleasant – and usually expensive. On a luxury cruise, people might expect to go to nice bars and restaurants, shop for fine jewelry or “liquor” (expensive alcohol), or get a massage. Luxury cruises also have “casinos” (large rooms where people can gamble, or play games for money) and theaters with live performances. People might “get dressed up” (wear very nice clothing) for special dinners on a luxury cruise.
Most families with young children prefer “family cruises” that are designed “with children in mind” (while thinking about children). Many of these cruises are “themed” (reflecting one major idea), such as Disney cruises where children can enjoy vacation with their favorite characters like Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. On a family cruise, there are many games, contests, and other organized activities for children. There are also many pools with “slides” (long pieces of plastic that one sits on and moves down before falling into the water).
Other types of cruises “cater to” (serve) specific types of people. For example, a
“singles cruise” is designed for people who are not married and are looking for a romantic relationship. A “retirement cruise” is designed for older people who have stopped working.
