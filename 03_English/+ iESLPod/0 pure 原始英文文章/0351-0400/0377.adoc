This episode is a dialogue between Kenji and a police officer, about his car that has been stolen. Let’s listen.
[start of dialogue]
Kenji: Hello, my car was stolen and I want to report it.
Officer: Where was it when it was stolen?
Kenji: It was parked outside of my apartment building. I went outside this morning to drive to work, and it was gone.
Officer: Okay, you need to fill out this form. Put down the make and model of the vehicle, the year, and the color. You’ll also need the license plate number. Do you know the vehicle’s VIN number?
Kenji: No, I don’t.
Officer: That’s okay. Just fill it out and we’ll launch an investigation.
Kenji: What do you think the chances are that I’ll recover my car?
Officer: That’s hard to say. If it was stolen by some kids who wanted to take a joyride, they’ll abandon it afterwards and you may get it back in one piece. If it was taken by professional car thieves, that’s a different story. They usually strip the cars of their parts and sell them to chop shops. You may not want your car back after it’s been stripped.
Kenji: I’ll just have to wish for the best.
Officer: We’ll notify you if we have some news.
Kenji: Thanks. In the meantime, I’d better get used to hoofing it around town!

The telephone conversation begins with Kenji saying, “Hello, my car was stolen and I want to report it (to report it stolen).” “Stolen” means it has been taken without his permission; it has been taken illegally. The police officer says, “Where was it when it was stolen (where was the car parked – where did you have the car when it got stolen)?” Kenji says, “It was parked outside of my apartment building. I went outside this morning to drive to work, and it was gone.” This happen to me once about, oh, 15 years ago, when I first moved to Los Angeles. I parked my car outside of my apartment building; I got up in the morning – this was a Saturday morning – to meet a friend for breakfast, and my car was gone! There was another car where I had parked my car. So, it’s not a very fun experience; I had to call the police.
Kenji says that he was going to work when he “found out,” or discovered his car was stolen. The officer says, “Okay, you need to fill out (or complete) this form (this piece of paper). Put down the make and model of the vehicle.” “To put down” means to write, in this case. The “make” of the vehicle is the name of the company who makes a specific product, such as Toyota or Ford or Mercedes Benz; these are the makes of cars. The “model” of the car is the specific car among the many that that company makes. So, if you drive a Toyota, you not only drive a Toyota, you drive a specific kind of Toyota – a Toyota Corolla; that would be the model of the car. So the make is Toyota; the model is Corolla. The “vehicle” is just another word for the car – the automobile.
So, the officer asks Kenji to put down – to write down the make and model of the vehicle, the year (what year it was made), and the color. She also asks him to write down the license plate number. The “license plate number” is actually, usually, a set of letters and numbers that are on the metal plate on the front and sometimes on the back of your car. These are plates, little pieces of metal, given by the government – the state government here in the U.S. – that identify your car, and only one license plate number is used for the car. In other words, no one else has that same combination.
The officer then asks Kenji, “Do you know the vehicle’s VIN number (or V-I-N number)?” “V-I-N” stands for vehicle identification number. It’s a long number that the maker of the car puts on the automobile that identifies that specific car, just like the license plate. Kenji says, “No, I don’t (I don’t know the number).” Most people don’t know the VIN number for their cars; they’re very long numbers – long set of numbers. The officer says, “That’s okay. Just fill it out and we’ll launch an investigation.” “To launch” means to begin, so they will begin an investigation; they will try to find out what happened to his car.
Kenji says, “What do you think the chances are that I’ll recover my car?” “To recover” means to get back something that you’ve lost or that has been stolen from you. Kenji is asking the officer what the chances are – how probably is it that he will get his car back. I can tell you that here Los Angeles the answer is not very probable at all! Although, I did get my car back, unfortunately it had had a couple of accidents before I got it back. The people who stole it had managed to hit another car with it, so I wasn’t able to really use it after that.
The officer says, “That’s hard to say (it’s difficult to tell you how good of a chance you have). If it was stolen by some kids who wanted to take a joyride, they’ll abandon it afterwards.” A “joyride” is when kids – teenagers, young adults – steal a car just to ride it around for fun. This is what happened to my car; it was stolen for a few days, and then it was abandoned. “To abandon” something means to leave it somewhere with no intention of returning (to) it, to give it up completely.
The officer says, “you may get it back in one piece.” “In one piece” means without any major damage; not destroyed, like my car was. “If it was taken by professional car thieves,” that is, someone who steals a car; we call that person a “car thief.” A “thief” is anyone who steals things. “If it was taken by professional car thieves, that’s a different story.” When someone says “that’s a different story,” they mean that’s a completely different situation, usually something that’s not good. “They usually strip the cars of their parts and sell them to chop shops.” So, when a professional thief steals a car, they “strip” the car, meaning they take it apart completely. They take off the doors, they take out the engine, they take off the wheels; they take it apart – they strip the car. “To strip” has a couple of different meanings in English – something of a dangerous word if you use it incorrectly. Take a look at our Learning Guide so that you don’t!
The officer says that they – the professional thieves – strip the cars of their “parts,” of the individual components or pieces, and sell them to chop shops. “To chop” is another word meaning to cut. A “chop shop” is a place where parts are taken from stolen cars and then sold. It’s a garage where the stolen cars are taken apart and then they sell the parts. So, it’s not a public place, because it’s illegal, of course, to steal a car, so chop shops are often places in bad neighborhoods or places where you don’t really know what is there. The officer says, “You may not want your car back after it’s been stripped.” So, if they take all the parts off of the car, you probably don’t even want the car back.
Kenji said, “I’ll just have to wish for the best,” meaning “I’m going to have to hope that there is good news.” The officer says, “We’ll notify you if we have some news.” Kenji says, “Thanks. In the meantime, I’d better get used to hoofing it around town!” “To hoof (hoof) it” means to walk, to travel by walking. It’s an informal expression. If someone says, “I’m going to hoof it to the store,” they mean “I’m going to walk to the store.” A “hoof,” as a noun, is the foot of an animal, like a horse has a hoof. Sometimes we call the feet of animals “paws,” such as with a dog or a cat.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

What Else Does It Mean?
model
The word “model,” in this podcast, means the specific product that a company sells: “This company makes three models of MP3 players. Which one do you like best?” “Model” can also mean a small or miniature version of something: “He liked to build model airplanes.” Or, “Before starting to build the new government building, the architect made a model to show what the new building will look like.” A “model” is also a person who is paid to wear a company’s clothing for advertising: “She is a model for a children’s clothing store.” Finally, “model” can also mean a standard or an example of something used for other people to follow: “He is a model citizen.” Or, “The new workers were shown a model of what they would be building.”
to strip
In this podcast, the phrase “to strip” means take apart completely or to remove the major parts of something: “The burglars stripped the store of all its computers.” The word “strip” also means a thin and narrow piece of something: “Can you cut the chicken into long strips?” Or, “I don’t think that even a small airplane can land on this thin strip of land.” Also, “strip” means to remove one’s clothes: “The kids stripped down to their bathing suits when they got to the swimming pool.” Finally, “strip” means to take away: “The country’s leader was stripped of her power and a new leader took her place.”
Culture Note
Oftentimes when a car is stolen in the United States, the car thief will take the car to a chop shop. At the chop shop the stolen car is “disassembled“ (taken apart). After the stolen car is disassembled, its parts are sold to “disreputable” (not trustworthy; not honest) auto service and auto body shops across the country that use these parts to repair their customers’ cars, usually without their customers knowing that the parts are stolen.
When a chop shop sells a stolen car’s parts, it is very difficult for the police to “track” (find; locate) those parts. Individual parts do not have a VIN number printed on it, so there is no way for the police to “identify” (recognize) or “trace” (locate the owner of) a part from a stolen car.
For this reason, it is not easy to avoid buying stolen parts unless you buy your car parts directly from a large auto supply store or a store that is part of a “chain” (a main company with many store locations). If you are getting your car repaired or serviced, you can take your car to the “dealership” (store that sells cars) where the car was purchased, or an “authorized” (having official permission to do business) service location. Those who don’t take their car to the dealership, but to an independent auto repair shop instead, can ask if the shop buys its parts directly from the dealership.
Interestingly, chop shops prefer to get older cars rather than newer cars because the parts for older cars are usually worth more money than parts to newer cars. It is easy for people to find new car parts at any auto store, but it’s difficult to find parts for older cars.
