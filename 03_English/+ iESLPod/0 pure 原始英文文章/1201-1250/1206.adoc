This episode is a dialogue between Emma and Ricardo about doing things I never do – outdoor sports and activities – while on vacation. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Emma: Are you ready?
Ricardo: Sure, but why are you dressed like that? I thought we were going to play golf with Kareem and Karen.
Emma: I told them we’re going rock climbing instead.
Ricardo: I was really looking forward to a game of golf.
Emma: You play golf all the time. How often do you get the chance to do other outdoor activities, such as horseback riding and zip-lining. We can do both this afternoon if you’re up for it.
Ricardo: I thought the point of this vacation was to rest and recharge.
Emma: We do need to recharge, but what we need is excitement, not rest. Maybe Kareem and Karen will want to join us tomorrow.
Ricardo: Why? What are we doing tomorrow?
Emma: How about a watersport, maybe kayaking, windsurfing, or water skiing? Too bad we can’t go scuba diving, but we can do some snorkeling.
Ricardo: I like the idea of spending some time on the water, but whale watching is more my speed.
Emma: Don’t you want to feel the wind through your hair and the excitement pumping through your veins?
Ricardo: I didn’t know you were such an adrenaline junkie.
Emma: Guilty as charged. I’m going to take skydiving lessons next month. Want to join me?
Ricardo: I consider skydiving a spectator sport!

There are two kinds of people in the world. There are those who like going outdoors and doing things, and then there are those who like being indoors and doing things that don’t require being in the sun or getting bitten by mosquitoes. I am one of the latter – that is, I am one of those who doesn’t really like being outdoors. But many people do like being outdoors, and so we’ll talk today about outdoor sports and activities, especially the sorts of things that people do on their vacation, or so I am told.
Our dialogue begins with Emma saying, “Are you ready?” Ricardo says, “Sure, but why are you dressed like that?” Ricardo can’t understand the way in which Emma is dressed, the clothing she has on. Ricardo says, “I thought we were going to play golf with Kareem and Karen.” “Golf” (golf) is a game in which players hit a small white ball with a long metal stick called a “club” (club). My father loved golfing. He used to go golfing two or three times a week after he retired from his job, when he was older.
Emma says, “I told them,” meaning Kareem and Karen, “we’re going rock climbing instead.” “Rock climbing” is a sport that involves going up a rock wall, or a side of a large rock, usually with ropes and other instruments for safety. Some people go rock climbing on the side of a mountain or a large rock, say, in the middle of the desert, which you can do here in Southern California. Other people go rock climbing on a wall where it isn’t actually a rock you’re climbing on, but rather a wall that is made to look like a big rock.
I tried going rock climbing once. I was trying to impress a beautiful girl – the sister of a woman I was working with at the time. This was, oh, 25 years ago. I absolutely hated it and I wasn’t very good at it. The girl was much better than I was and, well, I never saw her again. Anyway, rock climbing is what Emma is planning on doing.
Ricardo says, “I was really looking forward to a game of golf.” “To look forward to” something is to anticipate something in the sense that you want to do it. “I’m looking forward to having a glass of wine this afternoon.” I really want to have a glass of wine. Thinking about it makes me happy. That would be what Ricardo is doing here. He’s “looking forward,” or “was looking forward,” to a game of golf.
Emma says, “You play golf all the time. How often do we get the chance to do other outdoor activities, such as horseback riding and zip-lining.” “Horseback (horseback) riding” is when you get on top of a horse and go with the horse, usually at a slow speed, but sometimes at a fast speed, depending on how good you are at riding a horse. I have never been horseback riding. I’m kind of scared of the idea of getting on top of a horse. Maybe I should try a donkey or some animal that moves a little more slowly.
Emma mentions horseback riding and “zip-lining.” “Zip (zip) – lining (lining)” is an activity in which you are attached, you are connected, to a long cable (cable) – a metal rope, you can think of it as – that is high up in the air, and you actually ride, if you will, on this cable. You go down the cable, often over a beautiful area out in nature. I, of course, have never been zip-lining. It looks like fun. Maybe someday I’ll try it.
Emma says, “We can do both this afternoon if you’re for it.” “To be up for” something is to be ready to do something, especially something that might be a little difficult or challenging. Ricardo says, “I thought the point,” the reason, “of this vacation was to rest and recharge.” “To recharge” means to get your energy back, to make you feel like you can do something again, to make you feel as though you are ready to go back to work, for example. Many people go on vacation to “recharge,” to get their energy back by relaxing and doing things that are fun.
Emma says, “We do need to recharge, but what we need is excitement, not rest.” Some people go on vacation to rest. Some people go on vacation to do things that are exciting. Emma wants to do something that is exciting. She says, “Maybe Kareem and Karen will want to join us tomorrow.” Ricardo asks, “Why? What are we doing tomorrow?” Emma says, “How about a water sport?” A “water sport” is an activity that takes place in, of course, the water.
Emma mentions some water sports, including “kayaking,” “windsurfing,” and “water skiing.” “Kayaking” (kayaking) is going out in a little boat called a “kayak” that is designed for one person. “Windsurfing” (windsurfing) is the sport of riding on a small surfboard that has a sail attached. A “sail” (sail) is a flat piece of material or cloth that is able to use the wind to help you move forward. Windsurfing involves going fast on the water on a surfboard, a special kind of surfboard called a “sailboard.”
Another water sport Emma mentions is “water skiing” (skiing). Normally we think of “skiing” as something you do in the wintertime or in a cold place where there is snow. You move fast down a hill or a mountain. That would be “downhill skiing.” “Water skiing” is when you have skis and are being pulled by a boat and you move across the water, holding on to a rope that is attached to a boat. I have never gone water skiing or windsurfing or kayaking. I’m not really much interested in water sports.
Emma continues, “Too bad we can’t go scuba diving, but we can do some snorkeling.” “Scuba (scuba) diving (diving)” involves going under water while using some special equipment that allows you to breathe underwater. You have what’s called an “oxygen tank” (tank) on your back, and that allows you to breathe for a long time while you are underwater.
“Snorkeling” (snorkeling) is swimming just below the surface of the water. Your face is in the water but you are breathing through a special “tube” (tube), that is above the water and allows you to keep your face underwater while being able to breathe. Have I ever gone scuba diving or snorkeling? Of course not. I’m back at the hotel reading and having a drink.
Ricardo continues, “I like the idea of spending some time on the water, but whale watching is more my speed.” “Whales” (whales) are large mammals in the ocean. “Whale watching” is when you go out on a boat and look for whales in the ocean. You can do that here in Southern California, although I have never gone on a boat whale watching, myself. Ricardo says whale watching is more his “speed” (speed). The expression “more his speed” means more interesting to him – something that is a better match for his interests and his level of energy.
Emma says, “Don’t you want to feel the wind through your hair and the excitement pumping through your veins?” Emma is describing the experience that Ricardo can have if he goes windsurfing. She says Ricardo can feel the excitement “pumping (pumping) through his veins (veins).” “To have something pumping through your veins” means to, in this case, be filled with excitement, that makes your body feel the excitement.
Your “veins” are the parts of your body that move blood back and forth – your veins and your arteries. We use the verb “to pump” to describe the action the heart goes through in moving blood around the body, and therefore “pumping through your veins” describes the heart being so excited, pumping so much, that the blood is moving through your body more quickly.
Ricardo says, “I didn’t know you were such an adrenaline junkie.” An “adrenaline (adrenaline) junkie (junkie)” is a person who enjoys excitement, who gets energy from sometimes dangerous activities. Emma says yes, she is. But instead of just saying “yes,” she says, “Guilty as charged.” The expression “Guilty (guilty) as charged (charged)” is used to say that you agree with what someone says about you, but it’s a funny way of saying it because normally “to be guilty” of something is to have done something wrong.
Emma doesn’t think she’s done anything wrong. She’s just trying to be funny when she says “Guilty as charged.” She says, “I’m going to take skydiving lessons next month.” “Skydiving” (skydiving) is the rather insane activity of jumping out of an airplane and then opening up what is called a “parachute” (parachute). A “parachute” is a large piece of material that allows you to move down towards the ground slowly, so you don’t kill yourself. That’s “skydiving.”
Emma says, “Want to join me?” Ricardo answers, “I consider skydiving a spectator sport!” A “spectator” (spectator) is someone who watches a sporting event or activity. A “spectator sport,” then, would be a sport you would only want to watch, you wouldn’t want to participate in. Ricardo thinks that skydiving is a “spectator sport,” meaning he doesn’t want to do it himself. He thinks it’s too dangerous. And frankly, I agree with Ricardo.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
[start of dialogue]
Emma: Are you ready?
Ricardo: Sure, but why are you dressed like that? I thought we were going to play golf with Kareem and Karen.
Emma: I told them we’re going rock climbing instead.
Ricardo: I was really looking forward to a game of golf.
Emma: You play golf all the time. How often do you get the chance to do other outdoor activities, such as horseback riding and zip-lining. We can do both this afternoon if you’re up for it.

What Else Does It Mean?
to recharge
The verb “to recharge,” in this podcast, means to regain one’s energy, or to do something that makes one feel rested and energetic after a period when one has been extremely busy or stressed: “The past few months have been tough. I need a vacation so that I can recharge.” The verb “to recharge” also means to add energy to an electronic device by plugging it in: “Could I please use your electrical outlet to recharge my phone?” The verb “to discharge” means for someone to fire a gun: “Which soldier discharged his weapon first?” Finally, the verb “to discharge” means to officially and formally allow someone to leave: “Who discharged that patient? We should have kept him here for overnight observation.”
more (one’s) speed
In this podcast, the phrase “more (one’s) speed” means more appealing or interesting to someone, or more aligned with one’s interests and energy level: “Being in a bullfight would be exciting, but I think watching the bullfight is more my speed.” The phrase “to pick up speed” means to accelerate, or to begin to move more and more quickly: “The freight train is very heavy, so it takes a while for it to pick up speed.” The phrase “to bring (someone) up to speed” means to give someone an update, or to share all the most recent knowledge and information with someone: “We typically need two weeks to bring a new employee up to speed on all of our corporate policies.” Finally, the phrase “at full speed” means with as much energy, effort, and enthusiasm as possible: “We’ll all have to work at full speed in order to meet the deadline.”
Culture Note
Adventure Travel
Some people look for “R&R” (rest and relaxation) when they are on vacation, but other people are looking for excitement and adventure. Many “travel agencies” (companies that help people plan their vacations) and small companies now specialize in “adventure travel” to help people have the exciting vacation experiences they desire.
Adventure travel combines “exploration” (learning about new places by visiting them) with a little bit of “risk” (the possibility that one could get hurt or die) and “physical exertion” (using one’s body). Zip-lining, kayaking, and skydiving are all popular forms of adventure travel, but some people like to “take it further” (do something in a more extreme way).
For example, people who go “heli-climbing” ride in a helicopter to a “remote” (very far away from cities and other people) place, where they are left to “climb” (move upward using one’s body) to a “peak” (the highest part of a mountain). And “heli-skiing” is when people ride in a helicopter to go to a remote, “snow-capped” (with snow at the top) mountain and “ski” (glide over snow while wearing long, narrow, flat pieces under one’s boots) down the mountainside.
Many people enjoy “bungee jumping,” an activity in which they wear a “harness” (straps that are fastened around one’s body, like a vest) that is attached to a long, “stretchy” (able to get longer) elastic cord called a “bungee cord.” Then they jump from the top of a bridge or other position high up, falling very far and stretching out the cord, which then “snaps back” (becomes short or small again), pulling the person up before he or she hits the bottom surface).
