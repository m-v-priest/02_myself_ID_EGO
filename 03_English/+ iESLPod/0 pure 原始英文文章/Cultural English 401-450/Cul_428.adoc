Today we’re going to talk about another famous American, this time an American athlete by the name of Jim Thorpe. We’ll also talk about something called the United States Uniform Code of Military Justice and the common crimes that are covered under that code. And, as always, we’ll answer a few of the questions you have sent to us. Let's get started.
Our first topic on this Café is one of the twentieth century's most famous American athletes, Jim Thorpe. James Francis Thorpe, more commonly known as Jim Thorpe, is widely acknowledged, or said to be, the greatest all-around athlete that ever lived in the United States. Being an “all-around athlete” means that he could play many sports very well. He played baseball, American football, basketball, he ran track, and he won two Olympic gold medals.
Thorpe was born on May 28, 1887, in the small town of Prague, Oklahoma. We have many cities in the U.S. that are named after cities in Europe. Prague is obviously named after the city in the modern Czech Republic. Our Prague is located about 60 miles, that’s 96.5 kilometers, east of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Oklahoma is in the very center of the United States, north of the state of Texas.
Thorpe had a twin brother named Charlie. Charlie is another form of the name “Charles.” A “twin” (twin) is a brother or sister who is born at the same time, on the same day, as the other brother or sister. Two babies born at the same time are called “twins.” Three are called “triplets” (triplets). Four are called a lot of extra work for Mom and Dad.
Jim Thorpe was born on a “ranch” (ranch), which is similar to a farm but has animals, like cows, instead of crops or plants for food. Thorpe was a Native American, sometimes called an American Indian, and a member of the Sauk (Sauk) and Fox tribe, or group of Native Americans. His Native American name was “Wa-tho-huck,” which means “Bright Path” in English.
It was clear from an early age that Thorpe was a talented athlete. By the time he was 10 years old, he could ride horses, shoot guns, and swim very well. (Compare this to me, who at the age of 10 didn’t know how to ride a bike, much less a horse.) Thorpe and his twin brother, Charlie, were very close friends. Sadly, Charlie died of pneumonia, an infection of the lungs, in 1896, when he was only eight years old. Jim Thorpe was extremely sad about the loss of his brother and soon lost interest, or was no longer interested, in sports and in school.
In 1889, his parents sent him to Haskell Indian School, a school in the state of Kansas, which is close to Oklahoma. Haskell was a school only for Native Americans. In another sad moment of his life, his mother died in 1901 of blood poisoning (blood poisoning),or an infection of the blood, while giving birth to another baby. But the unhappiness did not stop there. His father also died of blood poisoning from an injury in 1904, shortly after Thorpe arrived at another school, the Carlisle Indian School, in 1903. Blood poisoning was common in the late 1800s and early 1900s because people didn’t understand the importance of cleaning wounds, washing hands, and keeping medical tools clean.
Though Thorpe had always been interested in sports, it was at Carlisle that his interest really grew. Carlisle was located in Pennsylvania, which is in the eastern part of the United States, near the state of New York. In 1907, he joined the “intramural” (intramural) football team. An “intramural team” is one that any student of the school can join and play on for fun. Thorpe was a very good football player. The school’s football coach noticed him and asked him to join the school’s regular team, the team that played against the teams from other schools. So Thorpe began playing football for the school in 1908.
Thorpe also joined the track team and focused on jumping and hurdles. Members of the “track (track) team” often run around all or part of a 400-meter track or circle as part of their competitions. Members of a track team also throw things and jump in the field in the center of the track. Thorpe focused on jumping and on hurdles. “Hurdles” (hurdles) are low structures with two flat sides and top that rests on the ground. They make a running race more difficult, because runners must jump over them while they are running around the track.
Thorpe got bored of school and left for two years, during the years of 1909 and 1910. During this time, he got a job playing baseball in North Carolina. In 1911, he went back to Carlisle and continued playing football and being on the track team. He also began training for the 1912 Olympic games. In addition to jumping and running, he learned other track skills like throwing. At the 1912 Olympic trials, where the athletes who will be members of the Olympic team are selected, Thorpe was placed on the American team.
At the Olympics, which took place that year in Stockholm, Sweden, Thorpe won two gold medals: one for the pentathlon and one for the decathlon. The “pentathlon” (pentathlon) is a track event where athletes compete in five different tasks: shooting (guns), fencing (fighting using swords), swimming, horse riding, and running. The “decathlon” (decathlon) is a track event where athletes compete in 10 different running, jumping, and throwing tasks. When the King of Sweden gave Thorpe his gold medals, he said, “You, sir, are the greatest athlete in the world.”
Unfortunately for Thorpe, in 1913 his medals were taken away from him; he had to give them back to the Olympic Committee. Why? Well, at that time, it was an Olympic requirement that all athletes be amateurs. This meant that they could not be paid to compete or play in their sport. Because Thorpe had been paid to play baseball briefly in North Carolina in 1909 and 1910, he was accused and found guilty of not being an amateur athlete. This happened even though the gold medals he won were not in baseball.
Thorpe’s medals were taken away and given to the athletes who placed second in those events. Although Thorpe was very upset by this, he didn’t let it stop him from playing sports. Over the course of the next 15 years, he played professional baseball, football, and basketball. He was also co-founder of an all-Native American football team called the “Oorang (Oorang) Indians.” He retired from, or stopped participating in, professional sports in 1928.
Like many Americans, Thorpe struggled during the Great Depression in the 1930s, when many people lost their jobs and the economy was in very bad shape. He had trouble finding work and took jobs in construction (building houses and buildings) and as a security guard (someone who guards or watches buildings). He moved out to California and became an actor in the movies, but only got small roles and was never very successful. He made very little money and did not live the rich, fancy life we now associate with professional American athletes.
When Thorpe was diagnosed with lip cancer in 1951, he had to seek charity, or help from others, to pay for the treatment because he had no money to pay for it himself. He died of a heart attack on March 28, 1953, leaving behind one wife, two ex-wives, and eight children. After his death, there were many people who were upset that Thorpe was not recognized as the incredible athlete that he was. For years, these people asked the Olympic Committee to give Thorpe’s gold medals back to him “posthumously” (posthumously), or after his death.
Finally, in 1982, Thorpe’s gold medals were restored, or returned to him, and he was once again considered as one of the winners of the Olympic games in Stockholm in 1912. Jim Thorpe is still considered to be one of the, if not the greatest athlete of all time by many people, and not just in the United States. What made Thorpe different from other athletes of his time and of today was not just his excellent athletic talent, but his ability to play multiple sports extremely well.
Let’s turn now to something called the United States Uniform Code of Military Justice. It is often simply called the “UCMJ” for short. The UCMJ is the set or collection of laws that are used by the United States military. The UCMJ was passed or approved by Congress in May of 1950 and was signed into law by President Harry S. Truman that year. It became effective – that is, people needed to follow it – beginning May 31, 1951.
Before the UCMJ was created, the military followed the Articles of War. The word “article” here just means laws or rules. The first Articles of War were created in 1775. They were then updated in 1776, 1806, 1874, 1916, 1920, and 1948. Finally, after World War II ended, members of the government created the UCMJ to make sure that all branches, or sections, of the United States military were following the same laws and rules for punishments.
There are five branches, or parts, of the military in the United States: the Air Force, the Army, the Coast Guard, the Marines, and the Navy. The Air Force is responsible for flying the planes. The Army is responsible for supplying the men needed to fight, especially on the ground. The Navy is responsible for the ships. The Marines are a special group considered to have some of the best and toughest soldiers, and are linked or connected to the Navy. Finally, the Coast Guard is responsible for protecting the waters around the United States itself.
Each of these branches or divisions of the military has active duty members and reserve members. “Active duty (active duty) members” are people whose full-time day job is to serve in the military. “Reserve members” have other jobs they do, such as banking or teaching, but offer to serve in the military a few times a year or when the military needs extra people.
All members of the United States military – both active duty and reservists when they are serving in the military and not doing their everyday jobs – are subject to, or have to follow, the UCMJ, which is of course separate from the “normal” laws that the rest of us have to follow. Students at the military schools in the United States are also subject to the UCMJ.
This means that students who attend the United States Military Academy (for the Army), the United States Naval Academy (for the Navy), the United States Coast Guard Academy, and the United States Merchant Marine Academy must abide by or follow the UCMJ. In addition, people who retire from the military and receive retirement pay or benefits such as medical care also must abide by the UCMJ.
The UCMJ has 12 sections that cover everything from exactly what the UCMJ is to the offenses or crimes, the types of trials, and the punishments allowed in the military. Perhaps the most common offense or crime tried under the UCMJ is being “absent without leave,” sometimes abbreviated “AWOL.” When military service members want to take a vacation or take some time off, known as “leave,” they must ask their commanding officer or boss for permission.
If the service member takes time off without asking for and receiving leave, they are considered “Absent Without Leave,” or away from their job without permission. If someone remains Absent Without Leave for 30 days or more, they can be tried for “desertion” (desertion) which is trying to leave the military permanently without permission.
When people join the military services in the U.S. – and remember, the United States has a completely voluntary military, so no one is forced or required to be there – they have to sign basically a contract that says they will stay a certain number of years. Usually four years is the least you can sign up for. If you try to leave before your time is up, you can be arrested and tried for desertion and then sent to prison. So, don’t do that!
Other offenses that are covered in the UCMJ have to do with protecting the country and respecting the military ranks or positions of power. For example, a service member can be tried for “espionage” (espionage), which is spying – getting and sharing of secret information on the United States with another country. They can also be tried for failure to obey or follow an order, sort of like the husband must obey the orders of his wife. Isn’t that right, husbands?
They can be tried for conduct or behavior unbecoming or not appropriate to a member. The UCMJ also includes laws and rules related to crimes like murder, sexual assault, and arson, or setting fire to something on purpose. It also has a law against cats – okay, maybe not that last one.
Most cases receive “non-judicial punishment.” Non-judicial (non-judicial) means that they are tried outside of a formal court with a judge. The service member will have a meeting with his or her chain of command or bosses, who will decide if that person is innocent or guilty. They will also decide what punishment the person should receive if they are guilty.
The most common punishments are a reduction in pay, which means that they get paid less for a certain amount of time, or a reduction in rank, which means they get demoted, or moved to a lower position of power in the military. The service member can also be confined, or kept in his room and not allowed to leave for a period of time.
More serious crimes go through a special legal process called a “court martial” (martial). A “court martial” is when the person goes to a court and is tried by lawyers before a judge, similar to our normal justice or legal system. The court process also operates or works very similarly to civilian, or non-military, courts except that everyone involved is a member of the military, including the lawyers and judges. There is a civilian court that can review, or go over, the decisions made by the military court, however, so if someone believes the military was unfair to them or did not follow its own rules, he or she can appeal.
“To appeal” (appeal) means to ask someone with higher or greater authority to overturn, or reverse, the decision against you. This court is called the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. The term “Armed Forces” is just another word for the military. This process makes sure that the UCMJ is being followed and that all service members are being treated fairly. So, if you ever decide to join the U.S. military, now you know what to expect: the UCMJ, and not very good food.
Now let's answer a few of your questions.
Our first question comes from Chandler (Chandler) in China. Chandler from China wants to know how the cell phone system works in the United States – specifically, how people pay for their cell phone service. Like most countries, the United States has a couple of different ways that you can pay for your cell phone or mobile phone service. There are two basic plans. One is called a “postpaid (postpaid) plan.” The other is called a “prepaid (prepaid) plan.”
A “postpaid plan” – say that ten times fast: “postpaid plan, postpaid plan, postpaid plan” – is where a customer pays a monthly bill. Every month, the telephone company will send them a bill, and they have to pay it. A “prepaid plan” is where you pay in advance, usually for a certain amount of time or for a certain number of minutes that you can use. For example, there is a plan that you can buy that will give you 1,000 minutes in a month and unlimited texting – you can text as many people as you want – and that might cost $20 every month.
A term you might hear related to prepaid cell phone plans is called “top up.” “Top up” is when you add money to your mobile phone in order to continue using it. Most of the big cell phone companies in the U.S. do offer top up cards that you can buy, and the more you pay, of course, the more minutes and other things you can use on your phone for that month or for the amount of time the card lasts. So, if you want to ask somebody about adding money to your account, you can say, “I want to add money to my account,” or you could say, “I want to top up my account.” It means the same thing.
Saboori (Saboori) in Iran wants to know the difference between an “abbreviation” and an “acronym.” An “abbreviation” (abbreviation) is basically a shortened form of any word that's used to represent the longer word. People, for example, will say “apps” (apps) as an abbreviation for “applications.” Sometimes abbreviations become so common that they become words themselves and nobody even thinks about the longer word that it is substituting for. Similarly, the word “carbohydrates” can be abbreviated by saying “carbs” (carbs).
An “acronym” (acronym) is different. An acronym is when you use typically the first letter of each word of a phrase or a title, and you use those letters to form another word. So, for example, we have “NASA” in the United States – (NASA), all capitalized. That stands for, or is an acronym for, “National Aeronautics and Space Administration.” It's the part of our government that takes care of space and exploring space.
There are other acronyms that are popular, many acronyms that are popular. “PETA,” for example, (PETA) is “People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.” You have diseases that sometimes are known by acronyms such as “SARS” – “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.”
The difference between an “abbreviation” and an “acronym” is that an abbreviation is basically a short form of the word, while an “acronym” is made by taking typically the first letter or first couple of letters of several different words and combining them together. “Acronyms” are usually pronounceable. You can pronounce them like a word.
It is possible to use initials – just the first letter of an organization, the first letter of the words in an organization's name – to represent that organization. That would be called, technically, an “initialism” (initiaIism). For example, “MLB” stands for “Major League Baseball.” “NBA” stands for “National Basketball Association.” Those aren't exactly acronyms, but they do use the first letters of the words in their titles. If you're saying the name of each letter, then it's an “initialism.” If you're pronouncing the whole thing as a word, then it's an “acronym.”
Finally, and briefly, Norbert (Norbert) in Germany, originally from Poland, wants to know the meaning of the phrase “matter of form” (form). If someone says, “It's merely a matter of form,” what do they mean? They mean that this is the official procedure or the activity that is required by certain rules and regulations, but it's not actually going to make a difference.
When we say something is a “matter of form,” we mean that you have to do it in order to accomplish what you want to accomplish according to the rules, but it won't really make any difference in terms of what actually happens. It's sort of just a rule or regulation that you have to follow.

What Insiders Know
Military Terms Used in Daily Life
Like any large organization, especially the government, the U.S. military has its own terms and phrases used within its organization. Some of those phrases have “caught on” (become popular) among civilians and are now used in everyday conversation. Here are a few of those terms.
“R & R,” pronounced “r and r,” stands for “rest and relaxation.” In the military, it is used to refer to time that soldiers are permitted to spent away from the military “base” (compound; military location) or “deployment” (work assignment, usually in another country). Civilians use it in daily life to mean “vacation.” For example:
“We’re really looking forward to some R&R after working so hard to complete this project.”
The term “lifer” is used in the military to mean someone who spends their entire career or working life in the military. In daily conversation, we use it to refer to someone who begins their career working for one company, is trained there, and remains working there until he or she “retires” (stops working for the rest of one’s life, usually because of age). For example:
“Gerard is a lifer, who has worked here since graduating high school.”
In the military, the acronym “AWOL” stands for “absent without leave,” meaning that a solider is away from his work or assignment without permission, either for a short time or permanently. In daily life, people normally use it jokingly at work when a co-worker isn’t where they’re supposed to be, or not doing what they normally do or is expected to do. For example:
“Jenny has been AWOL since lunch. Do you think she went home early or is she in a meeting somewhere?”
