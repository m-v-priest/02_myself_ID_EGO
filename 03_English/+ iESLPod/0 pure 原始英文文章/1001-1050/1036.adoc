This episode is a dialogue between Brad and Irene about farming – growing food. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Brad: Is this your first visit to this area?
Irene: It is, and I’m surprised to see so many farms. I thought farming was a dying industry.
Brad: Family farms and small-scale farming are disappearing, but agribusiness is alive and well, thanks to government subsidies.
Irene: Are they lucrative?
Brad: They can be, but the subsidies were originally given to protect the livelihood of farmers.
Irene: And that’s not what’s happening?
Brad: Well, agribusiness has edged out small-scale farms because output is the name of the game. A lot of small-scale farmers have thrown in the towel.
Irene: That’s a shame, but the subsidies are still used to protect domestic food production, right?
Brad: That may be, but we’re losing a way of life. I come from a long line of farmers.
Irene: And you’re not farming?
Brad: Nope.
Irene: What do you do?
Brad: I work for the government agency that gives out subsidies to the very farms that put us out of business.
Irene: That’s quite a twist of fate.
Brad: You said it.
[end of dialogue]
Our dialogue begins with Brad asking Irene, “Is this your first visit to this area?” Is this the first time you have been here? Irene says, “It is, and I’m surprised to see so many farms. I thought farming was a dying industry.” A “farm” is a large area of land where food is grown and animals are also kept, animals that are used eventually for food.
Irene thought that “farming was a dying industry.” An “industry” (industry) is a business, or more properly a kind of business ?– a part of the economy that includes similar kinds of businesses. So, we could have the “movie industry.” That would include all of the companies here in Los Angeles and other places that make movies.
Irene thought that farming was “a dying industry.” “Dying” comes from the verb “to die.” “To die” means to stop living, to no longer be living. “Dying” implies that something is still alive, but it’s going to be dead very soon. The idea here is that not that many people are going into farming and that the business of farming won’t be around for a long time, at least in the area that Brad and Irene are talking about.
Brad says, however, “Family farms and small-scale farming are disappearing, but agribusiness is alive and well, thanks to government subsidies.” A “family farm” would be a farm owned by ?– that’s correct – a single family. Back in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, most farms were probably owned by individual families that grew food for themselves and, of course, to sell to other people.
However, during the 1970s and 80s, many of these family farms disappeared – that is, they were no longer able to be profitable, and so the families either sold the farm to a large business or to someone who wanted to do something else with the land. “Agribusiness” (agribusiness) is formed from two different words, “agriculture” and “business.” “Agriculture” is another word to describe the growing of food. “Agribusiness” is a word we use to describe large companies that own farms.
Brad says that “agribusiness is alive and well.” That expression “to be alive and well” is quite common in English. It means to be doing very well, to have a lot of success. The agribusinesses are successful, according to Brad, “thanks to” – or because of –“government subsidies.” A “subsidy” (subsidy) is when someone gives you money to do something. In the United States, as in many countries, the government tries to protect farms and to protect the agricultural business by giving businesses and farmers money – money to grow certain kinds of food.
Now, the economic reasoning for this activity is somewhat questionable, according to some economists. Many economists say it doesn’t make sense for the government to pay people in farming when they don’t pay people in other businesses in order to survive. Of course, there are arguments on the other side – that is, there are people who think it does do some good.
Irene says, “Are they lucrative?” “They” here refers to the businesses involved in agriculture. The word “lucrative” (lucrative) means profitable. It means making a lot of money. If your business is lucrative, you are making a lot of money, you are getting rich. Brad says, “They can be,” meaning these businesses can be lucrative, “but the subsidies were originally given to protect the livelihood of farmers.”
Brad explains why the government started giving subsidies to farmers many years ago. The reason, and the reason that many governments give, for the subsidies is “to protect the livelihood of farmers.” “Livelihood” (livelihood) refers to one’s job or career – how you make a living, how you make money. My livelihood is working for the Center for Educational Development doing these podcasts. Other people’s livelihoods depend on different jobs that they have.
The “livelihood of farmers,” then, refers to the economic wellbeing of farmers, the jobs of farmers. When most farms were owned by families, the government felt it was important to protect these families to make sure that they didn’t, if you will, “go out of business.” Irene says, “And that’s not what’s happening?” She’s questioning Brad, asking him if that is not still the purpose of these government subsidies.
Brad says, “Well, agribusiness has edged out small-scale farms because output is the name of the game.” The phrasal verb “to edge (edge) – out” means to do better than someone or something else so that you become more powerful and the other person or thing becomes less powerful, less influential, less successful. Brad is saying that agribusiness “has edged out small-scale” – small – “farms.” It has become more successful. Why? Brad explains that “output is the name of the game.” “Output” is what you produce, what you make.
Agribusinesses are large companies that produce a lot of food, and that makes them more successful. The phrase “the name of the game” means the most important thing in deciding how the way things are done. The name of the game in college is getting good grades and saying nice things to your professor, which gives you good grades. Well, that’s not exactly true. Just because you say something nice to your professor doesn’t mean he or she will give you a good grade, but in my own experience, it doesn’t hurt – meaning it will never harm you.
The name of the game here in agribusiness is “output” – is producing a lot of food. Brad says, “A lot of small-scale farmers have thrown in the towel.” The expression “to throw in the towel” (towel) means to give up, to stop trying, especially when something seems too difficult. Irene responds, “That’s a shame.” The expression “that’s a shame” (shame) is used to express sadness about something that is happening, especially something that seems unfair, unjust.
Irene says “The subsidies are still used to protect domestic food production, right?” “Domestic” (domestic) here means within the country. The opposite of domestic would be “international.” This is another reason why governments give subsidies to farmers. It’s to protect the production of food within the country, so that in case there is a war or other problems, they don’t have to rely on or depend on other countries in order to get their food. At least, that’s one of the official reasons given. I think it probably is more political than that, but we won’t get into that here.
Brad says, “That may be,” meaning yes, it’s possible that these subsidies are used to protect domestic food production. “But,” he says, “we’re losing a way of life.” A “way of life” is a way of living, the way things are done, the culture of that particular area. Brad says, “I come from a long line of farmers.” If you say “I come from a long line” of something, you mean that you have many family members involved in a particular business or industry or area. There is also the implication here that this has been going on for many years, perhaps many generations.
For example, I come from a long line of plumbers – people who fix toilets and sinks. My grandfather was a plumber. My uncles were plumbers. My father was not a plumber – he was a teacher – but the McQuillans are known in the place where I grew up, St. Paul, Minnesota, as plumbers, and still today my cousins own McQuillan Brothers Plumbing. So, I come from a long line of plumbers. I can also say I come from a long line of teachers, because my father is a teacher, my sister and two of my brothers were teachers, I have nieces who are teachers. But we’re talking not about me, but about Brad.
Brad is asked by Irene, “And you’re not farming?” Brad says, “Nope.” “Nope” is an informal way of saying no. Irene says, “What do you do?” Brad says, “I work for the government agency,” the part of the government, “that gives out subsidies to the very farms that put us out of business.” Brad says that he works for the government agency, the part of the government, that actually gives the money, the subsidies, to these large agribusinesses. He uses the term “the very farms that put us out of business.”
The use of the word “very” here means these precise, or exact, things. It’s a word used to emphasize the next word, the following word. Usually this construction, this word, is used when you are pointing out something that is ironic, something that seems contradictory. For example, you could say “The very parents who complain about the schools not doing their job are the ones that never help their children with their homework.” That’s not true, but that would be an example of using this word “very” to specify a group who seems to be acting in some contradictory manner.
Irene says, “That’s quite a twist of fate.” A “twist (twist) of fate (fate)” is an unexpected change in events, especially one that is ironic. So in this case, Brad used to work on a family farm, and now he works for the government agency that gives money to the agribusinesses that in some ways put the family farms out of business. So, it’s “ironic” (ironic). It’s the opposite of what you would expect.
Brad ends the dialogue by saying, “You said it.” That expression “you said it” is often used when you want to agree with what the other person has said and emphasize how correct the other person is. I’d say we use this expression when the other person is saying something negative. For example, it’s really cold in here. You might say, “You said it.” It is cold in here. You are agreeing with the other person and emphasizing how correct you think the other person is.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

What Else Does It Mean?
to edge out
The phrase “to edge out,” in this podcast, means to outcompete, or to do better than someone or something else so that its power or influence weakens while one’s own power and influence increases: “Through product innovation and effective marketing, we’re edging out our competitors.” The phrase “to edge up/down” means to increase or decrease slightly: “Sales are edging up, but not as quickly as we’d hoped.” The verb “to edge” can mean to move slowly, with many small movements: “The students edged closer to the blackboard as they tried to understand the calculation.” Finally, when talking about lawn care, “to edge” means to cut the borders of a grassy area, especially next to pavement, so that it appears neat and orderly: “Did you edge the grass by hand, or did you use a machine?”
very
In this podcast, the word “very” is used to emphasize the word that follows it: “Aren’t those the very clothes that you were wearing yesterday?” Or, “The very moment he saw Evelyn, he knew he wanted to marry her.” The phrase “one’s very own” emphasizes that something belongs to oneself and to no one else: “Karina was only 23 years old when she bought her very own home.” The phrase “the very thought of (something)” or “the very idea of (something)” means just suggesting something: “The very idea of losing my job makes me feel sick.” Finally, the formal phrase “very well” indicates that one agrees to do something: “Very well, I’ll help you move on Friday, but you have to return the favor when I move next year.”
Culture Note
Types of Subsidies
Businesses can receive many types of subsidies, but they can be divided into two “categories” (groups): “direct subsidies” and “indirect subsidies.”
“Direct subsidies” include “cash grants” and “interest-free loan.” A “cash” (money) “grant” (money given or awarded to someone for a purpose) is a “direct” (without the involvement of another person or organization) payment to the “recipient” (the person or organization that receives something). An “interest-free loan,” like any other “loan” (money that is given to someone with the expectation that it will be paid back), involves a cash payment, but the recipient must pay it back. However, the recipient does not have to pay “interest” (a percentage of the original amount) as he or she would if receiving a loan from a bank.
“Indirect subsidies” do not involve the payment of cash to a recipient, but they still “benefit” (bring advantages to; help) the “beneficiary” (the person who receives the benefits of something). “Tax breaks,” or opportunities to save money on taxes, paying less than usual, are an example of indirect subsidies. For example, if a community wants to “attract” (bring in) a large manufacturer in order to create jobs, it might offer a tax break so that the company does not have to pay taxes for the land where the factory is built. Another example of an indirect subsidy is a “rent rebate,” where the government “reimburses” (pays back) the company or a “portion” (part) or all of its “rent payments” (money paid to use land or a building).
