This episode is called “Outsiders (people who live in other places) Moving In (to a new place; a new neighborhood).” Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Leti: I am sick and tired of people coming from the big cities into our small town and buying up all of the houses and acting like they own the place.
George: This is a dying town and it needs fresh blood. I don’t hear the business owners complaining about the new infusion of money into the town.
Leti: Oh, yeah? Well, the flip side is that their spending is jacking up prices and making it harder for families who have lived here for generations.
George: The times are changing and we need to adapt.
Leti: I say that the newcomers are the ones who need to adapt. After all, they’re moving to our town.
George: With that kind of us against them mentality, there may be a day when you succeed in driving out those newcomers.
Leti: I look forward to that day.
George: All I have to say is beware what you wish for!
[end of dialogue]
Leti begins by saying to George, “I am sick and tired of people coming from the big cities into our small town.” The expression “to be sick and tired” doesn’t mean you’re actually ill; you’re not really sick and you may not even be tired. It’s an expression we use to show that you are angry, that you are frustrated, especially about something that continues to happen over a long period of time. “I’m sick and tired of hearing you talk about your dog and how wonderful it is.” I’m tired of it; I don’t want to hear it anymore, you’ve been talking about it for many days now. Leti is sick and tired of people moving from big cities into her little, small town. She says they are “buying up all of the houses and acting like they own the place.” “To buy up” means the same as “to buy.” The “up” has a certain sense of emphasis, that it’s happening quickly perhaps, or that you are buying all that remains of something, not leaving anything for anyone else. The “outsiders,” people from outside of the little town, “are buying up all of the houses and acting like they own the place.” “To act like you own a place” means to feel too comfortable, or perhaps too confident in a place where you don’t really belong. If you visit someone else’s house that you don’t know very well, and you come into the house and say, “Hey, where’s the refrigerator? I’m hungry,” well, that’s acting like you own the place. It’s also considered rather rude to do such a thing. So, “to act like you own the place” would be to do things that you don’t really have a right to do.
Leti is angry at these outsiders, but George has a different opinion. George says, “This is a dying town.” “To die,” of course, means to end one’s life; a “dying town” would be a town that is no longer doing very well economically; people are leaving, there aren’t enough jobs, things like that. George says the town “needs fresh blood.” “Fresh blood,” here, means new people, people who have not been present before. He says, “I don’t hear the business owners complaining about the new infusion of money into the town.” The business owners, the people who own the stores and other businesses, are happy. They’re not complaining about the new infusion of money. An “infusion” (infusion) really in this case just means addition, something that is added to it larger or bigger. In this case, the town is getting richer because new people are coming in and bringing their money and spending their money in the town.
Leti says, “Oh, yeah? Well, the flip side is that their spending is jacking up prices.” The “flip (flip) side” of something is the opposite side of a certain argument or issue. I could say, “Well, it’s a beautiful, sunny day,” and you could say, “Well, the flip side is it’s going to be very hot.” So it’s the aspect or the thing that you’re not thinking about, usually opposite of what the other person is talking about. It could be positive; it could be negative. Back in the old days, when I was a child, they would sell records, and the records would have a song on each side, especially the small what were called “45s.” So you may have a very popular song on one side, and on the flip side another song by the same singer, perhaps a little less popular; we also called it the “B-side.” In any case, “flip side” here is used generally to mean the other aspect of something that you haven’t considered. Leti says the flip side of these new people moving in – these outsiders – is that their spending is jacking up prices. “To jack up” is a phrasal verb meaning to increase. It’s normally used with the word “prices.” We talk about “jacking up prices,” we’re talking about increasing prices, things are getting more expensive. When you have more people wanting to buy the same amount of things or the same things as other people the price will usually go up, because there are people who are willing to pay more money now. This makes it harder, Leti thinks, for the families who have lived here for generations. A “generation” is usually people who are born around the same time; some people consider 20 years a generation. But in any case, the term here means people who have lived here a long time. My family has lived in the United States for eight generations, which is about right, a little more than that maybe. In any case, a long time is what is meant by this expression. Within a family, a generation are the people who are all born as brothers and sisters or cousins. So my parents is one generation, and my brothers and sisters were the next generation, and my nieces and nephews – the sons and daughters of my brothers and sisters – are a separate generation. So when I say that we’ve lived here for eight generations, I mean my great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather – actually grandmother came to the United States; that was the first McQuillan that arrived here, at least from my family. So that’s what a generation is. Anyway, enough about my family; let’s get back to the story. Where were we? Oh, yeah.
George says, “The times are changing and we need to adapt.” “The times are changing” means the world is changing, things are not the same as they were before. He says we need to accept that, “we need to adapt.” “To adapt” (adapt) means to change in response to the changes in your situation or in your environment. “Adapt” has a couple of different meanings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.
Leti says, “I say (meaning my opinion) is that the newcomers are the ones who need to adapt.” The “newcomers” (newcomers – one word) are the people who have just moved into an area; they are new to the area. She says that they are the ones who need to change, to adapt themselves to the small-town life rather than changing it and making those who have lived there for generations adapt. She says, “After all, they’re moving to our town.”
George says, “With that kind of us against them mentality, there may be a day when you succeed in driving out those newcomers.” Let’s start with “us against them mentality.” “Us against them” is the idea that you and your group are opposed to another group, that you have opposite interests or perhaps competing interests; what’s good for them is not good for you, and what’s good for you is not good for them. That’s “us against them” or “us versus them.” “Mentality” is the way of thinking about something; we might call it your “perspective.” George says that with kind of thinking – that kind of perspective, “there may be a day when you succeed in driving out those newcomers,” meaning in the future – some day – you may be successful, you may actually drive out the newcomers. “To drive out” is a two-word phrasal verb that means to do something to make other people leave, especially a neighborhood or a town, to do things that will make them want to leave. There are other meanings of the verb “to drive,” and “to drive out,” as well as the verb “to adapt” that we talked about earlier. All of that information can be found in the Learning Guide for this episode.
George says that Leti and her attitude may drive out these newcomers. Leti says, “I look forward to that day.” “To look forward to (something)” is to be excited about it, to be waiting for it to happen, to want it to happen now. George says, “All I have to say is beware what you wish for!” George is telling Leti that she should “beware” or be careful of what she wishes for, or wants to happen. It’s a phrase we use to warn someone that if he or she gets what he or she wants there may be some bad things that they haven’t thought of, things that you may not expect, so that sometimes we need to be careful about wanting to change things.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Culture Note
The Consumer Price Index and the Cost of Living Allowance
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measurement of how the prices of “consumer goods” (things bought by individuals and families, not by businesses) change over time. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics identifies a “market basket” (a group of items that are bought and sold) of goods and services and determines how much it would cost to buy all of those goods and services each year.
The CPI is used to measure “inflation” (the decrease in the purchasing power of money over time). It is also used to indicate changes in the “real value” (how much an amount of money in the past is equivalent to today) of prices and income.
The Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) is similar to the CPI. It addresses how much the “cost of living” (the amount of money needed to purchase housing, food, clothing, transportation, etc.) is in different parts of the country. The COLA is used to “adjust” (make changes to) “salaries” (the amount of money one earned for working), usually once a year.
Many web pages help people compare the cost of living in different parts of the country. The cost-of-living “calculators” (formulas) can help people determine how much money they would need to maintain a “comparable” (similar) lifestyle in a different part of the country. For example, one calculator shows that the cost of living in Houston, Texas is 40% lower than the cost of living in Los Angeles, California. Therefore, someone living in Los Angeles “on” (with a certain amount of money) $60,000 per year could maintain the same lifestyle on $36,000 in Houston.
