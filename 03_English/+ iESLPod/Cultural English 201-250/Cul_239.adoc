On this Café, we’re going to talk about the Central Intelligence Agency, known more popularly as the CIA. That’s the government agency that is involved in gathering information about other countries. We’ll also talk about The Wizard of Oz, which is a very well-known book and even more well-known movie. As always, we’ll also answer a few of your questions. Let’s get started.
We begin this Café begins with a discussion about the CIA, which stands for the Central (or main) Intelligence Agency. The word “intelligence” normally refers to how smart someone is. However, intelligence can also refer to the ways that countries gather secret information about other countries or groups; it could also refer to how businesses and organizations try to gather information about their competitors – the other companies.
During World War II, the United States had an intelligence agency known as the Office of Strategic Services, or OSS. The OSS was the first organization to try to coordinate intelligence efforts for the entire country – for the entire government. Before the OSS was formed – before it began, many different U.S. government agencies were involved in a little bit of intelligence work here, a little bit there, but it wasn’t a very effective way to gather information – It didn’t work very well. The OSS was much better at collecting intelligence, but it was a wartime agency, created only for the period of time when the United States was fighting in World War II.
After World War II, in 1947, the United States decided to create its first peacetime intelligence agency, the CIA. “Peacetime” (one word) is the opposite of “wartime,” it refers to the periods of time when the country is not fighting a war. Today, the CIA “primarily,” or mostly, gathers and collects information about foreign governments, corporations, groups, and individuals. It then uses that information to provide advice to “policymakers,” the people in the government who actually create the laws and carry out, or execute the laws – enforce the laws. The CIA’s “headquarters,” its main offices are in Langley, Virginia, very close to Washington, D.C. Sometimes you will hear in movies or television programs people talking about Langley. Well, they’re referring to Langley, Virginia, where the CIA is located, so it’s another word for the CIA.
The CIA’s work is, as you can guess, very “secretive,” meaning that very few people know what the agency actually does. This, of course, invites a lot of speculation. “Speculation” is when people wonder about something, they begin to have their own ideas for what they think might be true, even though there isn’t a lot of good information to base those ideas on. For example, if a teenager’s behavior changes suddenly, the parents might engage in speculation: maybe he’s having problems at school, maybe he’s involved with drugs. They don’t really know – they’re speculating. The verb is “to speculate.”
Many novels and movies have speculated about what it must be like to work inside the CIA, and they speculate about what exactly the CIA does. One author in particular, Tom Clancy (Clancy), often writes about espionage and covert operations by the CIA. “Espionage” (espionage) is just another word for “spying,” sending people into another country secretly to gather information, or perhaps paying citizens of another country to send secret information back to your country. That’s espionage. Something that is “covert” (covert) is something that is hidden or secret, so a covert operation is an organized action that is secret; the idea is very few people know about it.
You may have seen movie The Hunt for Red October, which was based on Tom Clancy’s first novel. The main character in the book and the movie is a CIA analyst, someone who analyzes – who looks at information to figure out what it means. This analyst helps bring in a Russian “submarine,” a special kind of boat that travels underneath the water. It’s probably a somewhat romantic view of the CIA’s work. One can guess that – one can speculate that a lot of the work involved is rather boring, looking at newspapers, documents, trying to figure out what’s going on in a different country; it may not be as exciting as you think.
Because the CIA is so secretive, however, and because its work has serious “implications,” or consequences for international relations, it’s also a very “controversial” part of the U.S. government, meaning that people don’t always agree that what the CIA is doing is a good thing. For example, some people have said that the CIA has been involved in torture. “Torture” (torture) is the practice of using pain and fear to get people to do what you want them to do, usually to get them to tell you some secret piece of information. Sometimes we use this word in normal conversation as joke. We’ll say, for example: “Listening to the music of the Bee Gees is torture.” It really is torture!
The CIA has been “accused,” people have said that it has engaged in torture. The CIA has also conducted experiments, according to some people, on humans to find out how chemicals can be used to get information. The CIA itself rarely defends itself in public, but when it has it’s argued that it’s extremely important to study these techniques to help protect the country.
The CIA has also been accused of being involved in assassination attempts. “Assassination” (assassination) is when you murder – when you kill an important person, often a government leader. Some of these assassination attempts have been in support of what is called “regime change.” Regime change is what happens when someone or a small group of people overthrow a government; they remove the current government and they take power in the country. Some people argue that the CIA should have a role in promoting or encouraging certain regimes to change. Other people think this is an inappropriate; this is not what the CIA should be doing.
So, it’s always very controversial, especially nowadays to talk about the CIA, but really it has been controversial for its entire existence, since 1947. Of course, many people argue that the CIA is necessary to help keep the country safe.
Now let’s turn to a “lighter,” more happy or less serious topic. We’re going to talk about The Wizard of Oz. A “wizard” (wizard) is a person who is said to have magical powers. Think of Harry Potter, for example. Traditionally, wizards are old men with long, white beards; the traditional dress is that they have a very tall hat that comes to a single point, what we would call a pointed hat. Wizards traditionally carry a “wand” (wand), which is a special stick that lets them perform their magic. If you read the Harry Potter books or have seen the Harry Potter movies, you see young wizards like Harry, but they also have a wand.
The idea for The Wizard of Oz came from a children’s book that was published in 1900, called The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. It was written by Frank Baum and W.W. Denslow. In 1939, someone made this book into a movie called The Wizard of Oz, and most Americans are more familiar with the movie than they are with the book. In fact, I’m guessing hardly anyone has read the book. But almost all American children grow up watching this movie on television at some time; I know I did.
When the story begins, there’s a young girl named Dorothy, and she lives on a farm in the state of Kansas, which is right in the center of the U.S. She lives there with her little dog named Toto, but she isn’t very happy living in Kansas – and who is? She thinks her life is boring. So when a “tornado,” which is a very strong, powerful windstorm, causes a window to hit her on the head, she becomes “unconscious,” or she begins to sleep – she’s not aware of where she is. However, we don’t know that, because the story actually shows her house being carried up into the sky, and she and her dog are taken away to this magic place called the Land of Oz. “Oz” (Oz) doesn’t mean anything in particular; it’s just a made-up name.
Well, when the house lands, a “witch” (witch), which is another person (a female; a woman) who has magical powers, and this witch tells Dorothy that she needs to follow the yellow brick road. “Brick” is a material that you can make houses out of; it’s usually square, about – I don’t know – two or three inches tall and five or six inches wide, and you put one brick on top of the other to build a house or a building. Sometimes bricks are used on streets and sidewalks, and that’s what is happening here. There’s a path – a street, if you will, called the yellow brick road, and the entire movie is about how Dorothy goes and walks along this yellow brick road in order to meet the Wizard of Oz. The Wizard of Oz is going to help her get back home, that’s why she is trying to find the Wizard of Oz.
So, of course, many strange things happen to her. She meets three characters who become her friends. The first character is a scarecrow. A “scarecrow” is normally a figure that is made to look like a man that a farmer puts in his or her fields to scare – to get the crows to go away. “Crows” are birds that can sometimes eat the things that are growing on the farm, and so farmers don’t like crows. We have crows that come outside of our house, usually about 6:00 in the morning, and they’re very loud. I sometimes go outside and clap my hands and try them to go away. Normally they don’t listen to me – like most people!
Anyway, each of these characters is missing something in their life. For the scarecrow, he doesn’t have a brain; he’s missing intelligence. Dorothy also makes friends with a man made of “tin,” which is a kind of metal that you use to make cans for storing food. So if you buy food in a can, it’s usually a tin can – a metal can. The Tin Man goes with Dorothy because he is lacking a heart. Finally, Dorothy makes friends with a lion, who’s called the Cowardly Lion. “To be cowardly” means to be afraid; it’s the opposite of courage or bravery. So, the Cowardly Lion is missing courage, and that’s what he wants to get from the Wizard of Oz.
I don’t want to tell you the rest of the “plot,” what happens in the movie. I would recommend trying to find this movie. It was made in the late 30s. The dialogue is sometimes a little slower in the movies that were made back then, so they are sometimes a little easier to understand. I think if you see it you will enjoy it. It’s certainly a very important part of popular culture in the United States.
There are many songs – it’s a musical, basically – there are many songs in the movie. I mentioned the yellow brick road; this is one of the songs: “Follow the Yellow Brick Road.” Everyone who has seen this movie knows this song: [Jeff sings]
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.
Follow, follow, follow, follow,
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.
And so on. There’s also a famous song by the actress who plays Dorothy, Judy Garland. She sings a very popular song called “Over the Rainbow.” A “rainbow” appears in the sky after it rains sometimes. It is of many different colors; it’s a very beautiful sight. It’s usually in the shape of an “arc” (arc), sort of like a half of a circle. The song became very popular in the United States, and it’s still one that most people know. It goes something like this: [Jeff sings]
Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up high.
There’s a land that I heard of once in a lullaby.
I know, a little out of tune! The lyrics – the words of the song begin “Somewhere, over the rainbow (somewhere on the other side of the rainbow, where the rainbow ends), way up high (high up in the sky). There’s a land that I heard of (that I had heard someone talking about) once in a lullaby.” A “lullaby” is a song that you sing to a young baby to get it to fall asleep. There are many famous lullabies that mothers will sing to their children, or fathers to their children, in order to get them to sleep.
There are other popular songs from this movie, and characters. For example, there is a good witch and there’s a bad witch. The bad witch is called the Wicked Witch. “Wicked” is just another word for being bad. There are also some imaginary characters called Munchkins, who are very short. We sometimes refer to children jokingly as being a Munchkin. If you’re an adult, and someone call you a Munchkin, they’re saying you are very short; it’s an insulting term.
Many of the “lines,” many of the things that the characters say in this movie have become part of American culture. For example, when Dorothy’s house lands, or comes down from the sky in the Land of Oz and she steps out of the house, she sees a lot of strange things and she says to her dog, Toto, “Toto, I have a feeling we’re not in Kansas anymore.” You’ll sometimes here Americans say that when they are experiencing something very unusual in a particular place. There are other famous lines from the movie as well.
Now let’s answer a few of your questions.
Our first question is from Ronaldo (Ronaldo) in Brazil. Ronaldo wants to know how we use the word “deliverable” as a noun.
“Deliverable,” or the plural “deliverables,” has become a very popular word in American business. Basically, it’s a term that is used in project management, when you are organizing, planning, and trying to manage a big project. A deliverable is something that is produced or created as a result of the project, usually something that will be delivered, or given to, the customer, or perhaps another part of the company to work on. It could be a document, it could be a report, it might be a piece of software; anything that your company produces can be a deliverable. But the term is especially used when you are in a big project, and you’re talking about things that you have to do, and then what is the result at the end. It has become part of what we would call corporate “jargon,” the special words and phrases that are used by a particular group.
“Deliverable,” when we are talking about project management, is different from another popular term in American business, “milestone” (milestone – one word). A milestone is an important action or event in the progress of creating the deliverable. So, you might have a two-week project, and you have certain milestones, certain things that you will do – A, B, and C – that you will accomplish along the way of producing the deliverable. So after you pass these milestones, then you get to your deliverable – you get to the final result.
Ningning (Ningning) in China wants to know the difference between “stress” (stress) and “pressure” (pressure). The two words can be used similarly; they have similar meanings when we are talking about using some sort of force – some sort of energy that is being exerted. That is, it is being directed to something else. We could talk about the pressure from the helium gas in the balloon, or the stress from the helium gas in the balloon. So stress and pressure have particular meanings when we are talking about using physical force.
A “stress,” specifically, is a force that is used when something pushes or pulls, or what we would call twists (that is, one ends moves in one direction, the other one moves in another direction), or pushes down on something. For example, running can put stress on your knees, because your body is pushing down on your knees.
“Pressure” is a general term used to describe putting the force of one thing onto something else, usually by touching it. So for example, if it is snowing and there is a lot of snow on the top of your house – on your roof, we might say that there is too much pressure from the snow on the roof. It’s going to damage, or hurt your roof.
That’s stress and pressure when we are talking about physical things; these terms can also be used in talking about mental or emotional issues. “Stress” means the feeling of tension, the feeling of being anxious, worried, or upset. “Pressure,” when we talk about it from an emotional point of view, means having a lot of serious issues or problems that you have to deal with. We often say, “He’s under a lot of pressure,” he has a lot of problems. Because he’s under so much pressure, he feels a lot of stress.
“Stress” has a final, third meaning, which means to emphasize something. For example, in English the word “English” is stressed on the first syllable, that’s where the emphasis goes.
Gustavo (Gustavo) in Uruguay he wants to know the meaning of the phrase he heard somewhere: “you had me at ‘hello.’” Aw, you had me at “hello”!
This is an expression used to show your affection – your attraction to another person. It’s a very romantic thing for someone to say. You’re saying that as soon as the other person said hello to you, you were like completely in love with them, you were attracted to them.
It comes from a movie from 1996 called Jerry Maguire; that was its name in English. It starred my twin, Tom Cruise, and the actress Renee Zellweger. When Tom Cruise, who plays Jerry Maguire, expresses his love for Dorothy, who is played by Renee Zellweger, in a long speech at the end of the movie, Dorothy finally says, “Shut up. Just shut up (she’s telling him he’s talking too much). You had me at ‘hello,’” meaning you don’t have to say all of those things. Just saying “hello” was enough to make me fall in love with you.
There’s also a song called “You Had Me at Hello” by a group called A Day to Remember, and a similar song, “You Had Me From Hello,” sung by someone named Kenny Chesney. Don’t ask me to sing either song, I’ve never heard of either one! But I have seen the movie Jerry Maguire, and if you haven’t, it’s a fun movie to watch.

What Insiders Know
Mad Magazine’s Spy vs. Spy
Mad magazine began in 1952 as a “humor” (funny) magazine intended for older children, teenagers, and adults. Many magazines published afterwards tried to “imitate” (be like the original), but Mad magazine was the most influential of its kind. Many of its characters are still part of American popular culture.
One “recurring” (happening again and again) part of the magazine since 1961 is a comic strip called Spy vs. (versus) Spy. A “comic strip” is a “sequence” (one after another) of drawings that tell a funny story. While some comic strips have written words to tell the story, Spy vs. Spy consisted only of drawings.
Spy vs. Spy “featured” (had as its main characters) two spies who were “identical” (the same) except that one is dressed “entirely” (completely) in black and one dressed entirely in white. The two spies constantly try to kill each other, “coming up with” (inventing; creating) more and more “intricate” (with many parts; complicated) ways of “doing away with” (killing) the other. In a typical comic strip, one spy sets a “booby trap” (a thing designed to catch or harm someone) for the other. Sometimes the booby trap works and the spy is killed (until the next comic strip, of course), but other times, the other spy comes up with a “counter” (working against) plan that kills the spy who set the original booby trap. The “appeal” (attractiveness) of the comic strip is to see what crazy and unusual things each spy comes up with to try to “get rid of” (eliminate) the other.
Spy vs. Spy was created by Antonio Prohias, who came to the United States from Cuba in 1960. He wanted to show the “futility” (pointlessness) of countries fighting each other, with the fighting getting more and more “intense” (at a high degree; very serious) all the time. The comic strip tries to communicate this message in a funny and clever way.
