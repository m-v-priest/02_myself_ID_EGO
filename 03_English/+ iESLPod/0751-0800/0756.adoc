This episode is a dialogue between Maya and Diego about having business meetings. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Diego: Okay, why don’t you brief me on what you’ve planned for the meeting tomorrow?
Maya: Sure. At the meeting of the managers tomorrow, we’ll begin with introductions. Since you’re the most senior manager, the job falls to you.
Diego: I don’t think we need to stand on ceremony. Have Alexi do the introductions.
Maya: All right. Then, we’ll follow the agenda and discuss each item of business. I have you down to lead the discussions.
Diego: I don’t think we need the meeting to be so structured. If we follow the agenda point-by-point, we’ll never find out what’s really on the minds of the managers, what issues they think are of paramount importance. I think I’ll open the floor to anyone who wants to raise an issue.
Maya: Wouldn’t that turn into a free for all? I’m not sure we’ll get much accomplished.
Diego: Sometimes, it’s not as important to accomplish something as it is to take the pulse of the group. If we want to know what issues are on the managers’ minds, we first need to let the managers speak freely. Agreed?
Maya: Uh, sure. You’re the boss. Should I also cancel the lunch I’ve ordered so you can make up your minds about food later?
Diego: Absolutely not! The one thing that’s not open for discussion is what I’m eating for lunch.

Our dialogue begins with Diego saying, “Okay, why don’t you brief me on what you’ve planned for the meeting tomorrow?” “To brief” (brief) someone on something means to give them very quickly the most important information. We usually, when there isn’t a lot of time, we use this expression. Tell me just the most important things I need to know. Of course, the word “brief” as an adjective means to be short. Here, we use it as a verb meaning to give me information quickly.
Maya says, “Sure. At the meeting of the managers tomorrow, we’ll begin with introductions,” meaning we’ll find out the name and the job of everyone there at the meeting. Maya says, “Since you (Diego) are the most senior manager, the job falls to you.” “Senior” means the one with the most experienced here. It can also mean older, but here in a company setting, the senior executives are those who have the most experience. Those are often the ones who are the oldest, as well. “The job falls to you,” Maya says. “To fall to (someone)” means to be your responsibility because of the way the rules or expectations are in this organization. “This job falls to you,” it’s your job, your responsibility; you have to do it.
Diego says, “I don’t think we need to stand on ceremony.” The expression “to stand on ceremony” means to be very formal, to not be casual, to follow all of the rules. But even though Diego is the senior manager, he doesn’t want to follow the tradition of him doing the work; he suggests Alexi do the introductions.
Maya says, “All right. Then, we’ll follow the agenda and discuss each item of business.” An “agenda” (agenda) is a written plan about what you are going to talk about in a meeting: first you’re going to talk about this, then you’re going to talk about that. Usually, if it’s a business meeting, you have a piece of paper that tells you, in order, the things that you’re going to talk about at that meeting, especially if it’s a very formal meeting. Maya says they’re going to discuss each item of business. At a meeting, an “item of business” is any topic or subject that’s going to be discussed. It doesn’t have to be actually related to business. You could have a formal meeting for an organization at your church or an organization in your community, and if you have a meeting of the leaders – of the directors – you might have different things on the agenda, each one of those would be an “item of business,” even though we’re not talking about a business like making money. Maya says, “I have you down to lead the discussions.” “I have you down” means I have written down – I have put down your name on a piece of paper, or I have your commitment, or I know that you are going to do this thing.
But Diego says, “I don’t think we need the meeting to be so structured.” The title of this episode is “Having (or holding) Structured and Unstructured Meetings.” “Structured” would be something that is planned very carefully: first you do this, then you do that. You follow the rules of a formal meeting very carefully, and everything is planned. Diego says, “If we follow the agenda point-by-point, we’ll never find out what’s really on the minds of the managers.” “Point-by (by) -point” means one thing at a time, one item of business at a time. Diego says that if we hold the meeting – if we conduct the meeting this way we won’t really find out what the managers at the meaning are thinking, what is “on their minds,” which means what are they thinking. Diego want to find out what the managers think is of paramount importance. “Paramount” (paramount) means extremely important, more important than anything else. If someone says, “this is of paramount importance,” they mean it is very important, highly important. Diego says, “I think I’ll open the floor to anyone who wants to raise an issue.” “To open the floor” is when the leader of a meeting says anyone can now speak about whatever topic they want to talk about. That would be a very “unstructured” meeting, a meeting that wasn’t planned carefully. Diego says he’ll open the floor to anyone who wants to raise an issue. “To raise an issue” means to mention a concern or a worry that hasn’t yet been discussed, or to ask a question that hasn’t been discussed.
Maya said, “Wouldn’t that turn (the meeting) into a free for all?” The expression “free for (for) all (all)” means to have a situation where everyone is talking at the same time. It’s very disorganized, not just unstructured, but lacking any sort of organization, being not very productive because everyone’s talking at the same time. Maya says, “I’m not sure we’ll get much accomplished (we’ll get a lot of things done).”
Diego says, “Sometimes, it’s not as important to accomplish something as it is to take the pulse of the group.” The expression “to take the pulse” (pulse) means to understand the way people are thinking or to understand the current situation, especially as it relates to people’s feelings and opinions. Literally, in your body your pulse is the blood that is going through your body. You can measure your pulse in a couple of different places: inside of your wrist, at the end of your arm, is one place. But as an expression, “to take the pulse” of a group of people means to get a good idea about what they are feeling and thinking. Diego says, “If we want to know what issues are on the managers’ minds, we first need to let the managers speak freely.” “To speak freely” means to speak openly, usually not to have to worry that you are going to be criticized, to speak without having to worry about how the other people, perhaps, are reacting. Diego says, “Agreed?” meaning do you agree with me, Maya.
Maya says, “Uh, sure. You’re the boss (you’re the person in charge). Should I also cancel the lunch I’ve ordered so you can make up your minds about food later?” “To make up your mind” means to decide, to make a decision. Maya’s saying well, maybe we shouldn’t have a planned lunch; you guys can just decide what you want to eat later. Diego says, “Absolutely not! The one thing that’s not open for discussion is what I’m eating for lunch.” So, Diego is willing to have people talk about whatever they want, but when it comes to lunch, deciding what he’s going to eat, he’s going to make a decision. “To be open for discussion” means that people can give their opinions, it hasn’t been decided yet. When it’s not open for discussion, a decision has already been made, and apparently Diego has made a decision about what he wants and everyone else will eat for lunch.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

to fall to
The phrase “to fall to (someone),” in this podcast, means to be someone’s responsibility, especially as the result of rules or expectations: “When Jesse lost his job, all of the childcare and housework fell to him.” The phrase “to fall into” means to begin doing something almost by accident, without having planned to do it: “Most people study accounting before becoming tax preparers, but Hannah kind of fell into it when she realized how much she enjoyed doing her own taxes.” The phrase “to fall back on” means to rely on something: “If your band isn’t successful, you can always fall back on your engineering degree.” Finally, the phrase “to fall for (someone)” means to fall in love or begin to have a romantic interest in someone: “Lionel fell for Betty the first moment he saw her.”
free for all
In this podcast, the phrase “free for all” means a situation where everyone is speaking at the same time in an unorganized way: “Teachers ask students to raise their hands so that the classroom doesn’t become a free for all.” A “free for all” can also be a fight that doesn’t have any rules and that involves many people: “Two boys started fighting at school today, but it quickly became a free for all involving almost all of the students in the classroom.” The phrase “for free” means without a price or charge: “The company gives away pens and magnets for free.” Finally, the phrase “free and clear” means without any consequences or without any responsibilities: “Even though witnesses had seen him steal the stereo, he walked away free and clear.”
Culture Note
Business Meeting Agendas
At most business meetings, each “attendee” (person who participates in a meeting) is given a copy of the agenda. The agenda lists each item of business and the approximate length of time that will be “devoted to” (set aside for; intended for) each topic.
A business meeting agenda “typically” (usually) begins with a “call to order,” where the “facilitator” (the person who leads the meeting) asks for everyone’s attention and officially starts the meeting.
The next item on the agenda is often review and approval of the “minutes” (written notes) from the last meeting. Sometimes someone is asked to read the minutes “aloud” (with a spoken voice, so everyone can hear) before everyone votes to approve the minutes.
The rest of the agenda is often divided into three parts: “old business,” “new business,” and “other items.” Under old business, people report on what they have done related to things that are discussed during each meeting, or that were discussed in the last meeting. Under new business, the facilitator presents new items of business that need to be discussed. Under “other items,” people are invited to “bring up” (begin discussing) anything else that was not listed on the agenda.
Throughout the meeting, someone is “tasked with” (responsible for) making a list of the “action items,” or things that must be done before the next meeting, as well as who is responsible for each action item. Toward the end of the meeting, that person reviews those action items to make sure everyone understands who is responsible for doing what before the next meeting.
The end of the meeting is usually spent identifying the date, time, and location of the next meeting.
