This episode is a dialog between Vera and Keigo about government officials, government workers, who aren’t honest. Let’s get started.
[start of dialog]
Vera: I can’t believe that Stan has been arrested. I know that he wasn’t always on the up-and-up, but he’s being accused of influence pedaling and taking bribes.
Keigo: Stan has been getting kickbacks for years. Everybody knew that if you wanted to get what you wanted from this department, you had to grease Stan’s palms. There isn’t a more corrupt official than Stan.
Vera: But he was always so nice to me.
Keigo: That was part of the problem. He was always good to his friends and family. That’s why he’s also known for his nepotism and cronyism. He gave friends and family plum jobs with big salaries. He had an entire good old boy network.
Vera: Do you really think he’ll go to jail?
Keigo: I’m sure of it. On second thought, if he can find a judge who’s on the take and is as corrupt as he is, he has a fighting chance.
[end of dialog]
Vera begins by saying, “I can’t believe that Stan has been arrested.” “To be arrested,” (arrested) means that the police take you from your home or your work, or wherever you are and bring you to a police station, usually because you have done something wrong. If you break a law, if you do something illegal, you can be arrested or taken by the police. Vera says, “I know that he wasn’t always on the up and up, but he’s being accused of influence peddling and taking bribes.” “On the up and up” is an expression meaning to be completely honest, not to be hiding anything, not to be lying or stealing. To be on the up and up – you’re being honest, you’re being sincere.
Vera says “Stan wasn’t always on the up and up,” meaning he wasn’t always honest, “but he’s being accused of influence peddling and taking bribes.” “To be accused of” something is for other people to say that you have done something wrong. The police say that you broke the law or your sister-in-law says that you didn’t wash the dishes as you had promised. You are being accused of something. Someone else is saying that you did something wrong.
Vera’s friend, I guess, Stan, is being accused of “influence peddling.” “Influence peddling” (peddling) is using your personal or professional connections with government officials – usually government officials, it could be other officials – in order to get them to make decisions that favor you. So, let’s say you own a large construction company. You build buildings. You build bridges and roads, and you have a friend who works for the government. Well, you take this friend to dinner, you, maybe, send him and his family on a vacation, you give him a new car, you’re trying to use your connection with that person to influence his decision, because he’s going to decide who gets the new government work, government contract, to work on, say, building a new road.
He gives you the contract because you have been using your influence, you have been influence peddling. “Influence peddling” doesn’t mean, in all cases, you’ve given the person money, however. If you give someone money, that’s called a “bribe” (bribe) which might be part of your influence peddling, I would suppose. A “bribe” is money given to someone illegally to do something or unethically, to do something. I should mention that the word “peddling” is from the verb “to peddle” which, in this case, means to sell. So, we talk about someone peddling something, we mean they’re out selling it, often on the street to people who are walking by. “Influence peddling” is, in a way, selling your influence, or using your influence to have a decision made in a certain way.
Keigo says, “Stan has been getting kickbacks for years.” “Kickbacks” (kickbacks) – one word – is money that you secretly pay someone in return for the help you got to sell something or to get a contract or to get an opportunity. Typically, a kickback is when, for example, I work for a bank, and I agree to give you a loan. I agree to give you money to help with your business but I say to you, “Well, if I give you this loan, you have to give me $500 – just me, not the bank.” In other words, you’re doing something that the bank isn’t giving you permission to do. That’s a kickback, when you ask for something back, usually, in a business transaction, in the case of buying or selling something.
Keigo says, “Everyone knew that if you wanted to get what you wanted from this department” – this government department – “you had to go grease Stan’s palms.” “To grease (grease) someone’s palms (palms)” means to give them a bribe. It’s an expression meaning to give money to someone illegally in order to get something done. So, if you give a government official money in order to get a contract or permission to do something, that would be greasing that person’s palms, whoever you gave the money to. Keigo says, “Everybody knew that if you wanted to get what you wanted from this department, you had to grease Stan’s palms. There isn’t a more corrupt official than Stan.” “Corrupt” (corrupt) is dishonest, someone who, for example, takes money, takes bribes, in exchange for certain favors, certain influence. That would be a corrupt official, a corrupt leader.
Vera says, “But he was always so nice to me.” Keigo says, “That was part of the problem. He was always good to his friends and family. That’s why he’s also known for his nepotism and cronyism.” “Nepotism” (nepotism) means giving jobs to your family members, especially government jobs. “Nepotism” is illegal in most places. You can’t just give your brother a job if you work in the government, because he’s your brother. If he’s the most qualified or best person, then that might be okay. “Nepotism,” however, is giving your close family members, your brother-in-law, your sister-in-law, your cousin, a job in, typically, the government, although it might be in another organization.
“Cronyism” (cronyism) means doing the same thing but for your friends; that is, giving jobs to your friends or other people because they are your friends, not because they are good at what they do. So “nepotism” is what we would call favoritism for your relatives. “Cronyism” is favoritism for your friends. “Favoritism” means giving favors or doing something good for that person just because they have that certain connection.
Keigo says, “He gave friends and family plum jobs with big salaries.” A “plum (plum) job” is a very desirable job, a well-paying job, a good job, one of the best jobs in the organization. “Plum” is a fruit that you eat – I have to think, yes, plum is a fruit that you eat from a tree. But the expression “plum job” means a very good job.
Keigo says, “He had an entire good old boy network.” The expression “good old boy” is one that refers to a group of, typically, men who have very strong personal and professional relationships and usually, when there is something to be done, they give that work to people in their own group. The word “network” just means a group of people. Usually, when we say a “good old boy network,” we mean a group of white men who are not allowing women or those who are minorities to be part of their circle and to get the same kind of treatment as those in their own “good old boy network.”
Vera says, “Do you really think he’ll go to jail?” We’re talking about Stan here. “Jail” (jail) is the same as prison. Keigo says, “I’m sure of it.” Then he says, “On second thought, if he can find a judge who’s on the take and is as corrupt as he is, he has a fighting chance.” “On second thought” is a phrase we use when we want to change our opinion, change something about what we just said. So, Keigo starts by saying that he’s sure that Stan will go to jail, then he changes his opinion. He says, “On second thought, if he can find a judge who is on the take and is as corrupt as he is, he has a fighting chance.” “To be on the take” (take) means that you are receiving bribes, that people are paying you money illegally to do things. “To have a fighting chance” means that there is a possibility of you winning. It’s going to be difficult but it is possible. What Keigo was saying here is that if Stan can find another government official, a judge, who will accept bribes, he might be able to avoid going to jail.
Now let’s listen to the dialog, this time at a normal speed.

Vera: I can’t believe that Stan has been arrested. I know that he wasn’t always on the up-and-up, but he’s being accused of influence pedaling and taking bribes.
Keigo: Stan has been getting kickbacks for years. Everybody knew that if you wanted to get what you wanted from this department, you had to grease Stan’s palms. There isn’t a more corrupt official than Stan.

Culture Note
The Whistleblower Protection Act
A “whistleblower” is someone who tells the media or the public about something wrong or dishonest that a company, government agency, or individual has done, especially when the action is against the law. Whistleblowers might be so “shocked” (surprised in a negative way) by what they have “witnessed” (seen or heard) that they want the rest of the world to know about it. But “blowing the whistle” (telling the truth about some hidden, dishonest activity) can be “risky” (with danger) for the whistleblower. Often whistleblowers risk losing their job or, in some cases, could even be “putting their life in danger” (doing something that brings a risk of death).
Whistleblowers “commonly” (often; typically) come forward to share information about illegal actions or the acceptance of bribes. In some cases, they are reporting about a “waste” (poor use) of “funds” (money). Other whistleblowers are sharing information about “safety code” (rules designed to keep people safe) “violations” (rule-breaking) that “endangers” (puts in danger) public health.
The Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 is a law that protects whistleblowers to “encourage” (help something to happen) to “come forward” (tell the truth when it is difficult or dangerous to do so). Any “authority” (person or organization with power) that “threatens” (says that something bad will happen; warns) to “take action against” (do something negative to) a whistleblower is violating the law.
However, even when the law is “enforced” (making people follow a law) as it should be, the whistleblower is in a difficult situation. The company or agency might not be allowed to tell the whistleblower to leave, but the workplace is probably an uncomfortable environment for anyone who has “tattled on” (said that someone has done something wrong) colleagues.
