This episode is a dialogue between Xavier and Aaliyah about getting old. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Xavier: What crazy new creams are you trying this week?
Aaliyah: I’ll have you know I only use anti-aging products that are scientifically proven.
Xavier: Yeah, like that cream that promised to restore your youthful appearance in just two weeks. When are you going to realize beauty products are sold using false claims and promises?
Aaliyah: What about you? You jump on the bandwagon of every health fad. Aren’t you eating a bunch of so-called superfoods?
Xavier: That’s based on science. The goal is longevity.
Aaliyah: And this expensive new computer program?
Xavier: It’s to ward off dementia and Alzheimer’s. I’m keeping my mind active.
Aaliyah: So we’re both trying to fight the effects of aging.
Xavier: I guess that’s true, but I’m going to outlive you.
Aaliyah: Yes, but before I kick the bucket, I’m going to look marvelous!
[end of dialogue]
Xavier says to Aaliyah, “What crazy new creams are you trying this week?” “Cream” (cream) is another word for “lotion” (lotion). “Cream” or “lotion” is a very thick liquid that you put on your skin, either as medicine because you have some problem with your skin, or to make your skin look more beautiful. Xavier is asking Aaliyah “what crazy new creams” she’s trying this week. The word “crazy” here probably just means unusual or strange or different.
Aaliyah responds, “I’ll have you know I only use anti-aging products that are scientifically proven.” The phrase “I’ll have you know” is used to present information to another person when you think that other person doubts you, or perhaps is attacking you, and you want the other person to know the truth. You want to tell the other person that he is wrong to attack you.
Aaliyah believes that Xavier is criticizing her. That’s because he uses that word “crazy” new creams. Aaliyah says, “I’ll have you know I only use anti-aging products that are scientifically proven.” “Anti-aging” refers to efforts to slow down or prevent the effects of getting older. Some companies sell certain creams or lotions that people can put on their skin that are supposed to prevent your skin from looking old, from looking as though you are getting old.
“Anti-aging” has become a popular commercial idea in the U.S. as people are getting older, especially people my age who have money to buy things that will, they think, prevent them from looking as old as they really are. I don’t buy these products myself, but other people do and Aaliyah is one of them. She only buys products that are “scientifically proven” – that is, for which there is some scientific research or scientific studies that show that this particular thing will actually help you.
Xavier doesn’t believe Aaliyah. He says, “Yeah, like that cream that promised to restore your youthful appearance in just two weeks.” “To restore” (restore) is to return something to the way it was before, to return something to its previous condition. Xavier refers to a cream that Aaliyah bought that was supposed to restore her “youthful appearance.” “Youthful” (youthful) refers to looking or feeling younger than you actually are.
Xavier says, “When are you going to realize beauty products are sold under false claims and promises.” Something that is “false” (false) is something that is not true, a lie. A “claim” (claim) is when someone makes a statement about something, when someone says something is true about a certain product or thing or person. A “false claim,” then, is the same thing as a lie, a “false statement” – an untrue statement about something. Xavier is saying that beauty products are sold using false claims, meaning the companies say things that aren’t true.
Aaliyah says to Xavier, “What about you?” meaning you are doing some of the same things that you are telling me not to do. She continues, “You jump on the bandwagon of every health fad.” The expression “to jump on the bandwagon” (bandwagon) means to begin doing something that is popular among a lot of other people or to start doing something just because a lot of other people are doing it. A “fad” (fad) is something that becomes popular very quickly, but lasts only a short period of time.
A common example of this would be certain popular dances. Everyone starts doing this dance, and then six months later, nobody is doing it. Here in the U.S. there are always dance fads. The “Macarena” from the 1990s would be an example of a “dance fad” – where everyone was dancing it, and then two or three months later, no one was dancing it – or at least here in the U.S. So there are “dance fads.” There are “clothing fads.” There are all sorts of “fads” – things that become popular very quickly, but are only popular for a short period of time.
Aaliyah says, “Aren’t you eating a bunch of so-called superfoods?” Aaliyah is criticizing Xavier for “jumping on the bandwagon” of a health fad. This health fad refers to eating “so-called superfoods.” A “superfood” (superfood) is a food that is supposed to be very good for you, very healthy. You may read in the paper about how blueberries are a “superfood.” They are supposed to do all sorts of wonderful things for you if you eat them. Aaliyah calls them not “superfoods” but “so-called super foods.”
The phrase “so-called” (called) is used to refer to something when you don’t really approve of or like that name or term, or you think it is somehow inappropriate or even wrong. “His so-called friend hit him on the head.” The term “so-called” is used there because your friend doesn’t normally hit you on the head, so you would be sort of odd describing that person as a real friend. So you would say “his so-called friend.” Perhaps he thought that person was his friend. Aaliyah is referring to these foods as “so-called superfoods,” meaning she doesn’t really believe they are superfoods.
Xavier disagrees. He says, “That’s based on science. The goal is longevity.” “Longevity” (longevity) refers to the ability to live for a long time. So we find out that Xavier has been eating things so he can live for a long time, and Aaliyah has been putting things on her skin so it will look like she is not old. Remember, this episode is all about fighting the effects and signs of aging – the things that will happen because you get old and indications that you are getting old.
Aaliyah says to Xavier, “And this expensive new computer program?” She’s asking about some new piece of software that Xavier bought. Xavier says that the computer program is “to ward off dementia and Alzheimer’s.” “To ward (ward) off” something is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to prevent something so that it doesn’t cause damage, or to stop something from having negative effects on you.
The computer program is supposed to “ward off dementia” (dementia). “Dementia” is when people have difficulty remembering things. They may even have changes in their personality. These are conditions that are sometimes associated with people getting very old, although not everyone who gets old has dementia. It’s when your mind begins to lose its memory and perhaps change your behavior. “Alzheimer’s” is a disease that causes a person’s brain to weaken over time. It also makes it more difficult to remember people, to remember facts, even to recognize people in your life.
Xavier thinks that this computer program will help “ward off” the effects of dementia and Alzheimer’s. He says, “I’m keeping my mind active.” “Active” (active) has a couple of different meanings. Here, it refers to someone actually doing something either with his body or with his mind. Xavier believes that if he keeps his mind active, if he keeps thinking about things and analyzing things, doing things with his brain, he will somehow be able to ward off the effects of old age.
Aaliyah then says, “So we’re both trying to fight the effects of aging” – that is, we’re trying to stop the bad things that might happen to us as we get older, both to our bodies and to our minds. Xavier says, “I guess that’s true, but I’m going to outlive you.” “To outlive” (outlive) someone is to live longer than another person. Women typically outlive men of the same age or who were born at the same time. We’re not sure if Xavier and Aaliyah are married to each other, but from the way they talk to each other, it certainly sounds like it.
Aaliyah says, “Yes, but before I kick the bucket, I’m going to look marvelous.” The phrase “to kick (kick) the bucket (bucket)” means to die. It’s an informal expression meaning to die. If someone “kicks the bucket,” someone has died. It’s sort of a funny phrase. You wouldn’t want to use it to describe the death of someone close to you.
Aaliyah’s kind of making a joke. She’s saying that before she dies, before she kicks the bucket, she’s going to look “marvelous” (marvelous). “Marvelous” means wonderful, very good. Aaliyah says she may die before Xavier, but she’s going to look wonderful when she does, because of course, she’s using all of this anti-aging cream on her skin.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

What Else Does It Mean?
cream
The word “cream,” in this podcast, means a lotion, or a very thick liquid applied to skin for cosmetic (beauty) or medicinal purposes: “The pharmacist recommended rubbing this cream into the skin to reduce muscle pain.” The word “cream” also refers to the fatty part of whole milk that rises to the top of the liquid: “Do you want some cream in your coffee?” The phrase “the cream of the crop” means the best of the group: “These students are the cream of the crop.” When talking about cooking, the verb “to cream” means to stir or mix two or more things together very quickly, especially using an electric machine: “First cream the butter and sugar, and then add the eggs and vanilla.” Finally, as a verb, “to cream” means to win by a lot, especially in sports: “We creamed that other team and won 20–3!”
active
In this podcast, the word “active” means with movement and activity, continuing to develop and interact: “Doctors recommend being active each day, even if you’re just going on a short walk.” If someone has “an active imagination,” he or she thinks creatively and has many interesting ideas: “Sheila wrote a story about a pig that could read people’s minds. She has such an active imagination!” The word “active” sometimes means intentional or purposeful: “For the past 10 years, Jerome has been an active member of the American Marketing Association.” Finally, an “active volcano” is a mountain that is likely to erupt (have hot liquid and rocks come out of the top) soon: “Hawaii has several active volcanos that tourists like to visit.”
Culture Note
American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine
Founded in 1993, the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine is a nonprofit organization that “promotes” (encourages and supports) the development and use of anti-aging medicine. It has “trained” (educated) and “certified” (awarded a diploma to) about 26,000 healthcare professionals, but many “respected” (admired by others) organizations and individuals do not believe the organization’s claim and “refuse” (will not accept, have, or do) to recognize anti-aging medicine as a medical “field” (an area of study). For example, the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) and the American Medical Association (AMA) do not recognize the field.
Some of the recommendations of the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine are “widely respected” (respected and agreed to by many people) in the medical community. For example, almost everyone agrees that a “healthy diet” (eating good, nutritious foods) and “exercise” (physical movement and activity) can minimize the effects of aging. But the American Academy of Anti-Aging promotes “hormone treatment” (the use of chemicals that are found naturally in the body) and other practices that other “medical practitioners” (doctors and other people who practice medicine) do not “condone” (approve of).
“Adherents” (people who follow something) of the organization say that it conducts valuable research, but “opponents” (people who are against something) argue that the so-called research is “quackery” (fraudulent practices related to medicine intended to trick people). Opponents “accuse” (say that something is wrong or illegal) the organization’s “journal” (academic publication) of pretending to present scientific medical research when it is really just advertising “unproven” (not yet shown to work) anti-aging products in order to “make a profit” (earn money).
