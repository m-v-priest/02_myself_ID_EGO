This episode is about going to a hospital and getting a special kind of drug so that you don’t feel any pain. I want that. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Nurse: I’m here to prep you for your procedure. Did the doctor already talk to you about the general anesthetic you’ll be getting?
Bruce: I don’t need a general anesthetic. I want to be conscious during the procedure.
Nurse: You’ll be inhaling a general anesthetic and getting an intravenous muscle relaxant. That’s standard for this procedure.
Bruce: I’m not a wimp. Tell the doctor all I need is a local anesthetic to numb the area.
Nurse: You’ll need something stronger. You don’t want to feel any sensation or pain during the procedure.
Bruce: I’m not afraid of a little pain. Bring it on!
Nurse: Anyway, the general anesthetic will wear off soon after the procedure. However, the doctor will keep you under sedation for the rest of the day so you can rest.
Bruce: Forget it. When it’s done, I’m going home. I’m not staying here overnight.
Nurse: That’s not advisable. You need to remain under observation for 24 hours.
Bruce: That’s for other people. I’m tough. I’ll be up and ready to go. What’s that needle for?
Nurse: It’s to give you a shot before your procedure.
Bruce: [whimpers] I don’t like needles. Get that away from me!
[end of dialogue]
Our dialogue begins with a nurse saying to Bruce, “I’m here to prep you for your procedure.” “To prep” (prep) means “to prepare.” “Prep” comes from the verb “prepare.” It’s a short form of that verb. “To prep” means to make someone ready for something – in this case, the nurse is prepping Bruce for his “procedure,” something that the doctor is going to do to him.
She then asks Bruce, “Did the doctor already talk to you about the general anesthetic you’ll be getting?” An “anesthetic” (anesthetic) is medicine that is given to you to prevent you from feeling pain. A “general anesthetic,” however, is medicine that usually makes you unconscious. This is something that is used, for example, when you are going to have what is referred to as a “major,” or important, “surgery” (surgery). A “surgery” is when a doctor goes inside of your body, cuts into your body, to do something we hope that will make you better.
So, a “general anesthetic” is something that usually puts you to sleep. This is compared to a “local (local) anesthetic,” which just makes certain parts of your body no longer feel anything so that the doctor can work on a certain part of your body without putting you completely to sleep. Bruce says that he doesn’t want a general anesthetic. He wants “to be conscious (conscious) during the procedure.” “To be conscious” is to be awake. It’s the opposite of “to be unconscious,” which is to be basically asleep.
Don’t confuse the word “conscious” with a similar sounding word, “conscience” (conscience). “Conscience” refers to your feelings of right and wrong. “Conscious” refers to being awake.
The nurse says, “You’ll be inhaling a general anesthetic and getting an intravenous muscle relaxant.” “To inhale” (inhale) means to breathe in, to bring in air or something else into your body, specifically into your “lungs” (lungs). Your “lungs” are what you use to breathe. Former president Bill Clinton famously said, when asked if he had ever smoked marijuana, that yes, he had, but he “didn’t inhale” – that is, he didn’t put the marijuana smoke into his lungs. We love politicians.
Anyway, the nurse says that Bruce is going to be inhaling a certain kind of gas which is a general anesthetic and getting an “intravenous muscle relaxant.” “Intravenous” (intravenous) refers to something going through your veins, which is a part of your body that carries blood. “Muscles,” of course, are those parts of your body that move your body parts, your bones, back and forth. A “relaxant” (relaxant) is something that relaxes you, make your muscles loose and, we would say, “limp” (limp), which is the opposite of “firm.”
So an “intravenous muscle relaxant” is basically an injection – that is, something that is put into your body with something called a “needle” (needle). A “needle” is a small thin metal tube, basically, that goes into your skin so that drugs can be put into your body.
The nurse is going to give Bruce a general anesthetic, which he will breathe in to his lungs, as well as what we would call simply a “shot” (shot), which is taking a needle and putting something into your body.
Bruce says, “I’m not a wimp.” A “wimp” (wimp) is a weak person who is not brave, who is not courageous, who is afraid of pain. Bruce says, “I’m not a wimp. Tell the doctor all I need is a local anesthetic to numb the area.” We explained “local anesthetic” as being a drug that prevents pain in a certain part of your body. The verb “to numb” (numb) means to cause you to lose feeling in a certain part of your body. If you lose feeling, you won’t feel pain there. That’s the purpose of a “local anesthetic.”
When you go to the dentist who works on your teeth, the dentist will often give you a “local anesthetic” to numb the parts of your mouth where the dentist will be working. The nurse says, however, that Bruce needs something stronger. “You don’t want to feel any sensation or pain during the procedure,” she says. “Sensation” (sensation) here means feeling something that you can feel when someone touches you – that’s a “sensation,” or at least one possibility of a sensation.
Bruce says, “I’m not afraid of a little pain. Bring it on!” That phrase “Bring it on” is used to show that you are ready for some problem or difficult situation or challenge. The nurse says, “Anyway, the general anesthetic will wear off soon after the procedure.” She’s explaining to Bruce that after the doctor has finished with his procedure, whatever it is, the general anesthetic “will wear off.” “To wear (wear) off” means to slowly, gradually, lose strength or effectiveness.
If you take a pill, if you swallow a pill that has medicine, eventually the medicine will probably “wear off,” meaning it will no longer be effective, perhaps two hours or five hours from when you take it. The nurse explains that the doctor will keep him “under sedation for the rest of the day.” “Sedation” (sedation) is when you are given drugs that don’t necessarily make you fall asleep but make you very calm, make you very relaxed.
Bruce says, however, “Forget it,” meaning no, I don’t want that. “When it’s done,” meaning when the procedure is finished, “I’m going home. I’m not staying here overnight,” meaning he doesn’t want to sleep at the hospital until the next day. The nurse says, “That’s not advisable.” “Advisable” (advisable) means recommended or useful or helpful.
The nurse says that Bruce’s idea of just leaving right after this procedure is “not advisable.” It’s not a good idea. “You need to remain under observation for 24 hours.” The phrase “under observation” means that someone is watching you or someone is monitoring you to make sure there aren’t any more problems. That happens a lot at a hospital. We say someone is “under observation” when the doctor and the nurses keep the person in the hospital to make sure there aren’t any more problems.
Bruce says, “That’s for other people. I’m tough,” meaning I’m strong. I’m brave. “I’ll be up and ready to go,” meaning after the procedure he’ll be ready to go home. Then he says to the nurse, “What’s that needle for?” The nurse says, “It’s to give you a shot,” an injection, “before your procedure.” The nurse is going to take the needle and inject, or put into his body, the drug.
Bruce suddenly, who said he was very tough and strong, starts to whimper. “To whimper” (whimper) means to make a small sound that indicates that you’re very scared. Bruce says, “I don’t like needles. Get that away from me!” We learn, of course, that Bruce isn’t as tough as he says he is.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

The phrase “to wear off,” in this podcast, means to gradually lose effectiveness or strength: “People who move to other countries often love everything at first, but those emotions wear off as people learn more about the new culture.” The phrase “to wear out” means to make someone very tired: “Wow, that long walk around the lake really wore me out!” The phrase “to wear out” can also mean to damage something or make it seem old through use: “I’m amazed by how quickly our boys wear out their shoes!” Finally, the phrase “to wear away” means to erode or to become thinner and weaker over time: “The carpet is wearing way in the hallways where people walk the most.” Or, “Paint wears away quickly in places where there is a lot of wind and rain.”
needle
In this podcast, a “needle” is a very small, thin metal tube with a pointed end, used to insert medicine through the skin and into the body: “The student nurses have to learn how to place a needle in the patient’s arm quickly and accurately.” When talking about sewing, a “needle” is a very small, thin piece of metal with a tiny hole at one end through which thread is placed: “Can you help me thread this needle?” Or, “Please use a smaller needle for the stitches, or it will leave holes in the fabric.” Finally, the phrase “like looking for a needle in a haystack” describes trying to find something that is almost impossible: “Trying to find a phone number for a real person at the phone company rather than a computer-generated recording is like looking for a needle in a haystack.”
Culture Note
The Classic Game “Operation”
“Operation” is a “table game” (a game played at a table, not while moving around) that was created in 1965. It is a “battery-operated” (uses batteries to run) box with the “image” (picture or drawing) of a human body that has many holes cut out of it. The game begins with a small plastic body part or other object placed in each hole, and the players must use small “tweezers” (a small metal tool used to pinch and grab objects) to pull the objects out without touching the “edges” (sides) of each hole. If the metal tweezers touch the metal edge of the hole, there is buzzing sound and the patient’s red lightbulb nose “lights up” (a light turns on). Then it is the next player’s turn.
The body parts include an “Adam’s apple,” which is the “common term” (used by ordinary people, not by doctors) used to refer to the “lump” (raised area) in a man’s neck that moves when he speaks. There is also a “broken heart” that represents “heartbreak” (feelings of sadness and loss, especially when a relationship ends). Players can try to pick up “butterflies in the stomach” which represent feelings of nervousness or anxiety, especially before performing or speaking in public. And they can try to pick up the “bread basket,” which is a plastic slice of bread and a reference to a common term for one’s stomach.
In 2004, the game makers, Milton Bradley, asked players to vote on a new piece to add to the game. They selected an ice-cream cone in the brain to refer to a “brain freeze,” or the intense headache many people feel when they eat something that is very cold too quickly.
