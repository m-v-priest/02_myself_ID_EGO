This episode is a dialogue about cleaning the house. Let’s get started.
[start of dialogue]
Malcolm: Do we really need to start doing spring cleaning today?
Lorna: We really should. The drapes need to be washed, the walls need to be wiped down, and the attic needs cleaning out. And we really should clean the upholstery on the sofa and dining chairs.
Malcolm: That’s a lot of work for two people.
Lorna: And I haven’t even mentioned what needs to be done in the kitchen. We need to defrost the freezer, clean the oven, clean out the cabinets, and scrub the floors.
Malcolm: I’m not sure I have the energy for all that.
Lorna: We also need to wash the windows, window screens, and windowsills, steam clean the carpets, and sweep out the garage.
Malcolm: If we hope to do all of that this weekend, then I think we need reinforcements.
Lorna: What do you have in mind?
Malcolm: I’m not the high school football coach for nothing.
Lorna: You mean . . .?
Malcolm: I think the guys need an extra-hard workout this weekend.
[end of dialogue]
We begin this episode with Malcolm asking Lorna, “Do we really need to start doing spring cleaning today?” “Spring cleaning” is something that Americans traditionally do in the springtime. It means to clean your entire house – to give a very thorough, detailed, if you will, cleaning of your house and organizing of things before summertime, I guess. We tend to do it in the spring – at least, that is what has traditionally been the case – but really the expression refers to a very thorough cleaning and organization of your house.
Malcolm wants to know if they have to start doing spring cleaning today, and Lorna says, “We really should” – we really ought to. “The drapes need to be washed, the walls need to be wiped down, and the attic needs cleaning out.” The “drapes” (drapes) are the coverings, that are typically made of cloth, that cover your windows. You can have a lot of different things that cover your windows. You could have shades, you could have blinds, or you could have drapes. Drapes are made of cloth, usually – a thick material that hangs down and covers the window when you want it covered.
“To wipe down” something is to clean it, usually by using a paper towel or a cloth that is wet. You take the cloth or the towel and you move it in an up-and-down direction in order to clean something. In this case, we’re wiping down the walls, which are probably dirty.
Finally, Lorna mentions the attic that needs cleaning out. The “attic” (attic) is located at the very top of a house, immediately below the roof. Not all houses have attics. If your roof is flat, you don’t have an attic. But if your roof comes to a point, then you typically will have some space between the wall and the top of the house, whatever floor that is.
If you have a two-story house, a two-level house, there’ll be space between the ceiling of the second floor and the top of the roof. That space is called an “attic” and is typically used for storage, for keeping things – boxes and other things – that you don’t need to have out to use, but want to keep. In some big houses, the attic is actually finished off – that is, walls are put up so that you can actually sleep there. In my house that I grew up in as a child, our attic was finished, which meant that you could go up there and sleep – and indeed, that’s where four of my brothers slept when I was growing up, and I eventually slept there when I got older.
But enough about me – back to Malcolm and Lorna and the attic that needs cleaning out. “To clean out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to clean completely. The “out” is used mostly for emphasis here to indicate that you are doing something very thoroughly. “I need to clean out my desk.” I need to get everything out of my desk. That actually is a phrase that you might hear if you are fired. You may tell someone to clean out their desk, meaning take all of your things with you because you don’t work here anymore. Here we’re just talking about cleaning out the attic in the house.
Lorna continues, “And we really should clean the upholstery on the sofa and dining chairs.” “Upholstery” (upholstery) is the cloth that covers the chair or the couch or some place where you sit. You have upholstery in your car, for example, over the seats that you sit on. You have upholstery on a sofa or a couch. You have upholstery, typically, on nice chairs. If the chair is made of wood and there is no cushion on it, then it doesn’t have any upholstery, typically. But if there is a cushion that makes it soft and nice to sit on, then usually that will have upholstery on it – that chair will have upholstery.
Malcolm, who obviously doesn’t want to work very hard, says, “That’s a lot of work for two people.” Lorna continues, “And I haven’t even mentioned” – I haven’t even said anything about – “what needs to be done in the kitchen. We need to defrost the freezer, clean the oven, clean out the cabinets, and scrub the floors.” “To defrost (defrost) a freezer (freezer)” is to turn the freezer off and let all of the ice – if there is ice inside of the freezer – melt in order to clean it out thoroughly.
A “freezer” is a place where you put food that you want to keep frozen – below 32 degrees Fahrenheit. “To defrost” means to clean out all the ice. And the old freezers – and I don’t think this is as common anymore – you used to have to defrost your freezer every few months or so if you wanted to clean it, because it would collect all sorts of ice inside of the freezer. At least, when I was growing up, that was the case with the freezer we had.
“Cabinets” (cabinets) are also called “cupboards” (cupboards). They’re basically wooden boxes with a door on them that are in your kitchen or other parts of your house where you keep things. “Kitchen cabinets” usually have dishes and pans and probably some food in them. Lorna is talking about cleaning out the cabinets – taking everything out of them and cleaning them. She also mentions “scrubbing the floors.” “To scrub” (scrub) usually means to rub something very hard in order to clean it – to move a cloth or perhaps some other instrument in order to clean something that is dirty and that requires that you use some physical force to get it clean.
Malcolm, again, seems to question whether he really has the strength to do this. He says, “I’m not sure I have the energy for all that.” But Lorna continues, “We also need to wash the windows, window screens and windowsills, steam the carpets, and sweep out the garage.” The “window screens” (screens) are basically thin pieces of wire or plastic that are put up in your window to allow you to open the window without having insects and other things from the outside come inside your house. So you open up, say, your glass window, but you don’t want bugs or mosquitoes or something to fly into your house, so you put up a metal screen that allows the air to come in and out, but nothing else.
Lorna says they have to wash the “window screens and windowsills” (windowsills). A “windowsill” is a flat piece of wood at the bottom of the window. It’s sort of the bottom part of the window. Lorna mentions “steam cleaning the carpets.” “To steam (steam) clean the carpets” is to use a machine that cleans the carpets or other cloth furniture that you have using water vapor, which is what steam is. If you take water and you heat it up, you will create water vapor, or steam. These are machines that used to be popular – I’m sure you can still find them today; they’re still used today – that clean carpets quickly and thoroughly by using hot steam as part of the process.
Lorna also mentions sweeping out the garage. “To sweep” (sweep) is to use a broom in order to push dust and dirt on the floor into something called a “dustpan” in order to clean the floor. The use of the word “out” here is once again mostly for emphasis. “To sweep out” means to clean and sweep very thoroughly.
Malcolm says, “If we hope to do all of that this weekend, then I think we need reinforcements.” “Reinforcements” here refers to other people who can help you. Normally, we use that term in the military when we’re talking about fighting a war and you need more soldiers, you need more troops. You bring in new men and women to help you fight. Those would be reinforcements. Here, Malcolm is using it sort of as a joke. He’s not actually talking about fighting a war. He’s talking about doing the cleaning.
Lorna says, “What do you have in mind?” Malcolm says, “I’m not the high school football coach for nothing.” We use an expression such as this, “I’m not a high school football coach for nothing,” to indicate that there is some benefit to this situation – some additional benefit, in this case, to the situation. What Malcolm is suggesting is that, because he is the coach of the local high school football team, he can get the boys from the football team to come over and help do the spring cleaning.
Lorna says, “You mean . . .?” Malcolm then replies, “I think the guys need an extra-hard workout this weekend.” A “workout” (workout) is a period of time when you exercise, which for me is usually never. What Malcolm is saying here is that he’s going to bring the members of the football team into his house to help him clean it.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
[start of dialogue]
Malcolm: Do we really need to start doing spring cleaning today?
Lorna: We really should. The drapes need to be washed, the walls need to be wiped down, and the attic needs cleaning out. And we really should clean the upholstery on the sofa and dining chairs.
Malcolm: That’s a lot of work for two people.
Lorna: And I haven’t even mentioned what needs to be done in the kitchen. We need to defrost the freezer, clean the oven, clean out the cabinets, and scrub the floors.
Malcolm: I’m not sure I have the energy for all that.
Lorna: We also need to wash the windows, window screens, and windowsills, steam clean the carpets, and sweep out the garage.
Malcolm: If we hope to do all of that this weekend, then I think we need reinforcements.
Lorna: What do you have in mind?
Malcolm: I’m not the high school football coach for nothing.
Lorna: You mean . . .?
Malcolm: I think the guys need an extra-hard workout this weekend.

What Else Does It Mean?
to wipe down
The phrase “to wipe down,” in this podcast, means to move a cloth or paper towel over a surface to clean it: “Wiping down the table can make it look cleaner, but it doesn’t disinfect it.” The phrase “to wipe (something) up” means to use a cloth or paper towel to pick up a liquid: “If something spills, please wipe it up before it dries and becomes harder to clean.” The phrase “to wipe (someone) out” means to make someone feel very tired: “A 10-mile run would wipe me out!” Finally, the phrase “to wipe (something) away” means to make something disappear or no longer exist: “If people continue to cut down the forests, they’ll wipe these animals away forever.”
to scrub
In this podcast, the verb “to scrub” means to clean something by rubbing it very hard and repeatedly, usually with a sponge or a cloth: “No matter how much I scrub this pot, I can’t get rid of that burnt soup.” A “scrub brush” is a sponge or a similar tool with a rough edge used to remove dried food or other substances from dishes or pots: “Are you sure this scrub brush won’t scratch the wine glasses?” When talking about cosmetics, a “facial scrub” or a “body scrub” is a product that cleans the skin while removing dirt and dead skin cells: “This facial scrub is supposed to make you look 10 years younger.” Finally, “scrubs” are the loose clothing worn by medical professionals: “The pediatrician often wears scrubs with cartoon characters that her young patients like.”
Culture Note
Types of Cleaning Professionals
Many people “earn a living” (make money) by cleaning other people’s homes and businesses. The people who clean “commercial buildings” (buildings used for business, not homes) are often called “janitors” or “custodians.” A “school janitor” is responsible for cleaning classrooms, hallways, and bathrooms after the students have left for the day. The term “custodian” is often considered more polite, but it has the same meaning. A custodian cleans a school or office buildings after the other workers “have left for the day” (have gone home after a day of work).
A “housecleaner” is someone who cleans other people’s homes. Most housecleaners come into a home every week or every other week and perform basic cleaning services. Some housecleaners might “assist” (help) with laundry, too, but this would be “beyond the scope of” (more than) what most house cleaners do. Sometimes housecleaners work in “pairs” (groups of two) or small teams, especially when they work for an “agency” (a company that matches housecleaners with homeowners who need help). The homeowner usually provides the “cleaning supplies” (chemicals and tools used for cleaning) and detailed instructions regarding how the home should be cleaned.
Very wealthy “households” (homes and the people living in them) might “employ” (give a job to) a part- or full-time “maid,” or a woman who cleans the home. A maid typically works for only one family in one house and provides services that other types of housecleaners wouldn’t be expected to do. For example, a maid might also be responsible for purchasing cleaning supplies and/or groceries, or possibly even assist with childcare.
