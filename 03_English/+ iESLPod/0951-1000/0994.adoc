Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 994 – Describing Accuracy and Inaccuracy.
This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 994. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

[start of dialogue]
Rona: This is impossible. I’m never going to hit the target. Why is it that I’m the only one in this archery class who has no aim?
Leonardo: You’re doing fine. I can tell you’re new to this. It takes some practice to develop any precision.
Rona: But you seem to be picking it up quickly.
Leonardo: I’m taking this class as a refresher. My father taught me the rudiments of archery when I was a kid, and I thought I would take it up again.
Rona: You’re really good. You’ve hit the bullseye three times already.
Leonardo: I’m using a much more forgiving bow than you are. If I aim for the target, I can usually get the arrow in the neighborhood of the bullseye.
Rona: You’re just trying to make me feel better. I’m hitting wide of the mark every time!
Leonardo: I think your arms are too tense and that tension is ruining your accuracy. Here, let me help you.
Rona: Watch out. With my aim, I could take you out.
Leonardo: I’ll take my chances.
[end of dialogue]
The topic of this episode is describing accuracy and inaccuracy. “Accuracy” (accuracy) can refer to whether something is true or correct. “Accuracy” is also used sometimes to refer to precision – whether something that you are trying to accomplish is done not only correctly, but precisely; that you are able, for example, to throw something and hit what you are trying to hit. If you hit it, you are being accurate. You are, in a sense, accomplishing what you are trying to accomplish. We see the latter use of that term “accuracy” in this dialogue. “Inaccuracy,” of course, would mean not accurate.
Rona starts by saying, “This is impossible. I’m never going to hit the target.” A “target” (target) is a person or thing that you are trying to hit. That’s why we are talking about accuracy in this dialogue, because we’re talking about trying to hit something for sport, as in part of a game. This is the sport of “archery” (archery). “Archery” is using what’s called a “bow” and “arrow” to hit a target.
The “bow” is usually a piece of metal or wood that has a string attached on the top and the bottom. You put a long, narrow piece of wood or metal in the string, and you pull the string back in order to shoot it. That long narrow thing is called the “arrow” (arrow). Archery is a sport that uses bows and arrows. In this dialogue, Rona asks, “Why is it I’m the only one in this archery class who has no aim?” She’s trying to make the arrow hit the target, but she says she has “no aim” (aim). “Aim” here is the ability to direct something such as an arrow so that it will hit your target.
Usually in archery the target is a series of circles, and you’re supposed to hit the middle circle in the center, and that is your goal. Rona says she doesn’t have very good aim. She isn’t able to direct the arrow so that it hits the target properly. Leonardo says, however, “You’re doing fine. I can tell you’re new to this. It takes some practice to develop any precision.” “Precision” (precision) is being able to be exact. Here, it’s just another word for accuracy.
Rona says, “But you seem to be picking it up quickly.” “To pick something up” is a phrasal verb which here means to learn how to do something. You can also pick something up literally, with your hand – you can put your hand down and pick up a pen, for example – but in this case, it means to learn something quickly.
Leonardo says, “I’m taking this class as a refresher.” A “refresher” is when you do something that you already have learned how to do, but need to be reminded again. You need to practice, perhaps, this skill some more. A refresher would be a class you take to remind you how to do the things you’ve already learned how to do. Leonardo says, “My father taught me the rudiments of archery when I was a kid, and I thought I would take it up again.” The “rudiments” (rudiments) of something are the basics of something, the basic skills to do something.
“To take something up” is to learn how to do something, to begin to learn how to do something. “To take up playing the piano,” for example, would be to learn how to play the piano, to start learning how to play the piano. So, “to take up” something is to start learning how to do something. “To pick up something quickly” is to learn something quickly. “To take up” emphasizes the fact that you’re just beginning to learn something, that you are starting to learn it.
Rona says to Leonardo, “You’re really good. You’ve hit the bullseye three times already.” A “bullseye” (bullseye) is the center of the target. Remember, I was talking about how targets in archery are usually circles, what we would call “concentric circles” – circles that go around other circles. Well, the center circle is the “bullseye.” Leonardo says, “I’m using a much more forgiving bow than you are.” The word “forgiving” here means that you can make more mistakes with it and it will still work okay; it will function properly even though you’re not great at using it.
Leonardo says, “If I aim for the target” – if I try to shoot at the target – “I can usually get the arrow in the neighborhood of the bullseye.” “In the neighborhood of” here means close to – not exactly on the target, not exactly where you want it to go, but close to there. Rona says, “You’re just trying to make me feel better” – you’re just trying to make me happier because I’m not very good at this.
She says, “I’m hitting wide of the mark every time.” The phrase “wide (wide) of the mark (mark)” means not close to where you are supposed to be, in this case, shooting the arrow. So, hitting it “wide of the mark” means not being very close at all. Leonardo says, “I think your arms are too tense and that tension is ruining your accuracy.” If you describe someone’s arms and legs as “tense” (tense), you mean that they’re very tight. Tense is the opposite of relaxed. “Accuracy,” we’ve already discussed, is precision.
Leonardo then offers to help Rona, and Rona says, “Watch out,” meaning be careful. “With my aim, I could take you out.” Rona is making a joke here. “To take someone out” here means to kill someone, to end someone’s life. Rona says, “With my aim” – since I’m such a bad shot, since I’m such a bad archer – I could kill you just by shooting my arrow. By accident, of course.
Leonardo, of course, is interested in Rona. He’s interested, in fact, in taking Rona out, but not in killing her – in taking her on a date. That’s interesting. I’ve never thought about the fact that we use that phrasal verb “to take out” to mean both to take someone on a romantic date and to kill someone. Interesting. There might be some relationship there. I don’t know.
Leonardo says at the end, “I’ll take my chances.” He again is joking. He says, “I’ll take my chances,” meaning I will do this even if it is risky and dangerous, because I want to help you – because, of course, he likes her.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
[start of dialogue]
Rona: This is impossible. I’m never going to hit the target. Why is it that I’m the only one in this archery class who has no aim?
Leonardo: You’re doing fine. I can tell you’re new to this. It takes some practice to develop any precision.
Rona: But you seem to be picking it up quickly.
Leonardo: I’m taking this class as a refresher. My father taught me the rudiments of archery when I was a kid, and I thought I would take it up again.
Rona: You’re really good. You’ve hit the bullseye three times already.
Leonardo: I’m using a much more forgiving bow than you are. If I aim for the target, I can usually get the arrow in the neighborhood of the bullseye.
Rona: You’re just trying to make me feel better. I’m hitting wide of the mark every time!
Leonardo: I think your arms are too tense and that tension is ruining your accuracy. Here, let me help you.
Rona: Watch out. With my aim, I could take you out.
Leonardo: I’ll take my chances.

Culture Note
Saxton Pope
Saxton Pope, born in 1875, is known as the “father of” (person who started or created) modern bow hunting. His father, Benjamin Franklin Pope, was an army officer and a doctor, and because of this, Saxton Pope spent most of his childhood in military camps and “frontier towns” (a town or city close to the boundary between two countries, states, or regions), where he developed outdoor skills. As a “youngster” (child), he spent his days in the “woods” (area with a lot of trees and plants).
Despite this unusual childhood, Saxton Pope “followed in his father’s footsteps” (did the same thing his father had done) and attended medical school. He graduated in 1889 and became a “surgical instructor” (a teacher showing medical students how to open the body to repair it) in 1912.
In a “museum” (building where art or historical items are place so others can see them) located near the building where Pope taught, a member of the Yahi Indian tribe named Ishi was employed as a “janitor” (person whose job is to clean buildings). Ishi was brought to the museum to be studied by Professor T.T. Waterman of the University of California. Ishi had “very little immunity” (for the body to easily develop illnesses or diseases) to disease and had been in the hospital frequently. This is where Pope met Ishi and the two became very close friends. Ishi taught Pope the language of the Yahi tribe, their “folklore” (traditional customs and stories), and eventually, taught Pope how to make bows and arrows, and how to “hunt” (find and kill animals for food or sport), just as the Yahi tribe did. They two remained very close friends until Ishi’s death in 1916.
After Ishi’s death, Pope continued to develop his skills with the bow. Later in life, Saxton Pope wrote an “influential” (important; having a lot of impact) book called Hunting with the Bow and Arrow, which “remains in print” (continues to be printed and available for purchase). The Pope and Young Club, an organization “dedicated to” (existing for the purpose of) hunting with a bow is named after Pope and his friend and “fellow” (also like him) bow hunter, Arthur Young.
