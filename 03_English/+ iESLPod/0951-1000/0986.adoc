Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 986 – Buying and Selling Family Heirlooms.
This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 986. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

[start of dialogue]
Anne: Where are you going with that?
Ivan: I’m taking this clock to an antique dealer. Rather than having it gather dust on the mantelpiece, I thought I’d get it appraised and maybe sell it.
Anne: You can’t sell that! It belonged to our grandfather. It’s a family heirloom.
Ivan: It’s not a family heirloom. It’s just a clock that Grandpa had in his house. He didn’t mean for it to be passed down from one generation to another. I don’t even know if it’s valuable or collectable. These clocks could be a dime a dozen.
Anne: But it’s valuable to me. It has sentimental value. As a little girl, I remember visiting Grandpa and seeing that clock on his shelf. If I had inherited it, I know I wouldn’t be looking to sell it to make a quick buck.
Ivan: I’m not looking to make a quick buck, but what if Grandpa left it to me because he knew I would be able to put the money that it would fetch to good use.
Anne: Well, are you? Are you going to put the proceeds to good use?
Ivan: Sure, of course I am.
Anne: Are you going to tell me what you’re spending it on?
Ivan: Not on your life!
[end of dialogue]
Anne begins this dialogue by saying to Ivan, “Where are you going with that?” Ivan says, “I’m taking this clock to an antique dealer.” “Antique” (antique) refers to something that is very old. An “antique dealer” (dealer) is someone who buys old things such as jewelry, pieces of furniture, artwork, or other things that are old and perhaps valuable. An antique dealer, of course, tries to buy things at a low price and then sell them at a high price just like any good businessperson. “Antiques” with an “s” at the end is used to describe these items – the things that you would bring to an antique dealer.
Ivan says, “Rather than having it gather dust on the mantelpiece, I thought I’d get it appraised and maybe sell it.” Ivan has taken a clock to an antique dealer in order to “get it appraised,” he says, “rather than having it gather dust.” “To gather dust” (dust) means to sit unused for a long time. “Dust” refers to the little pieces of dirt that accumulate, that collect, on top something if you don’t move it for a very long time. That’s why every week or two, you may need to dust your house. You may need to go around and clean the little bits of dirt off of your tables and other things that would collect dirt.
If something has a lot of dust on it, it hasn’t been moved or used in a long time, and that’s the real meaning of this expression, although in the case of an old clock, it might have literally – actually – been gathering dust. A “mantelpiece” (mantelpiece) is a shelf, a place to put something above a fireplace usually in the living room, or sometimes it might be called the “family room,” of a house. A mantelpiece is a place where you might put old photographs and an old clock.
Ivan says he wants to get this clock “appraised.” “To appraise” (appraise) means to assess or to give a value to something – to give an opinion about how much something is worth. You could have your house appraised. If you were trying to get a loan, someone would come and tell you how much your house is worth. When you go to an antique dealer to get something appraised, you’re asking the antique dealer how much money you could get if you sold that item. Anne does not like this idea at all. She says, “You can’t sell that. It belonged to our grandfather” – our grandfather owned it. “It’s a family heirloom.”
A “family heirloom” (heirloom) is something that belongs to your family that has been passed on, or given, from one generation to another. Usually, it’s something that’s considered valuable. So, for example, if your grandfather had an expensive ring, or your grandmother had some nice jewelry, that might be considered a family heirloom. Your grandmother gave it to your mother, and your mother gives it to you, and you give it to your daughter, and so forth. Those are family heirlooms, valuable things, but sometimes are valuable not because they’re worth a lot of money; sometimes they’re valuable for what we might call “sentimental reasons,” and we’ll explain that in a second.
Ivan says, “It’s not a family heirloom. It’s just a clock that Grandpa had in his house. He didn’t mean for it to be passed down from one generation to another.” Ivan says “Grandpa didn’t mean for it” – meaning he wasn’t intending, he wasn’t planning for it – “to be passed down.” “To be passed down” means to give one object, usually something that is old to someone younger than you are – to the next generation. For example, when I die, my microphone that I use for podcasting will be passed down to one of my nieces and nephews. It’s going to become a family heirloom, I’m sure.
“Generation” refers to a group of people who are born at approximately the same time. In a family, a generation would be all of the brothers and sisters in a family. Your father and mother are another generation, and your grandparents are another generation, and your nieces and nephews are a younger generation. You have younger generations and older generations. Ivan says this clock was not meant “to be passed down from one generation to another.” He says, “I don’t even know if it’s valuable or collectable.” “To be collectable” (collectable) is to be something that people want to own. Things that are collectible are usually things that are worth some money, that have some value.
Ivan says, “These clocks could be a dime a dozen.” That expression, “a dime (dime) a dozen,” refers to something that is very common, very popular, and therefore not worth a lot of money. A “dime” is 10 cents in American currency. A “dozen” is 12 of something. So, if you can buy 12 of something for a dime, it’s probably not a very valuable item. We usually use this expression to refer to things that are not rare – of which many have been made.
Anne objects. She says, “But it’s valuable to me. It has sentimental value.” “Sentimental (sentimental) value” refers to your emotional attachment to some object. It might not be worth anything to anyone else. It might not be very valuable in itself, but it’s something that means something to you. So, the first love letter that your husband wrote you or the first rose that you gave your wife – these would be things that might have sentimental value. No one else is going to buy an old rose or a piece of paper that has a love letter on it. These are things that are valuable to you. They have sentimental value.
Anne continues, “As a little girl, I remember visiting Grandpa and seeing that clock on his shelf. If I had inherited it, I know I wouldn’t be looking to sell it to make a quick buck.” “To inherit” (inherit) is to receive money or objects from someone who has died. You can inherit something from your parents. For example, they may give you things or give you money when they die. “To make a quick buck” (buck) means to try to make money quickly and easily. A “buck” is a dollar. It’s an informal term for one American dollar. “To make a quick buck” is an old expression meaning to try to make money quickly and easily.
Ivan says, “I’m not looking” – I’m not trying – “to make a quick buck. But what if Grandpa left it to me because he knew I would be able to put the money that it would fetch to good use.” “To fetch” (fetch) here means to bring money or to bring something to you. When we talk about what price this will fetch, we mean how much money will we get, what price it will be. What Ivan is saying here is that Grandpa may have left this clock to him because Grandpa knew that Ivan would put the money that he would get from it – the money he would fetch – to good use. “To good use” here means for a good purpose.
Anne says, “Well, are you? Are you going to put the proceeds to good use?” “Proceeds” (proceeds) is money that you get from selling something. There’s always an “s” on the end if it’s used as a noun in this way: “proceeds.” Ivan says, “Sure. Of course I am” – of course I’m going to put it to good use. Anne says, “Are you going to tell me what you’re spending it on?” Anne wants to know what Ivan is going to do with the money he gets from selling the old clock.
Ivan, however, refuses to tell her. He says, “Not on your life!” That expression, “not on your life,” means no way. It’s a phrase used to show that you are not going to do that, no matter what happens. Of course, we suspect that perhaps Ivan is not going to put the money to good use, but is going to go gambling, or perhaps go drinking with his friends, or something that we would not normally consider to be a good use.
Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
[start of dialogue]
Anne: Where are you going with that?
Ivan: I’m taking this clock to an antique dealer. Rather than having it gather dust on the mantelpiece, I thought I’d get it appraised and maybe sell it.
Anne: You can’t sell that! It belonged to our grandfather. It’s a family heirloom.
Ivan: It’s not a family heirloom. It’s just a clock that Grandpa had in his house. He didn’t mean for it to be passed down from one generation to another. I don’t even know if it’s valuable or collectable. These clocks could be a dime a dozen.
Anne: But it’s valuable to me. It has sentimental value. As a little girl, I remember visiting Grandpa and seeing that clock on his shelf. If I had inherited it, I know I wouldn’t be looking to sell it to make a quick buck.
Ivan: I’m not looking to make a quick buck, but what if Grandpa left it to me because he knew I would be able to put the money that it would fetch to good use.
Anne: Well, are you? Are you going to put the proceeds to good use?
Ivan: Sure, of course I am.
Anne: Are you going to tell me what you’re spending it on?
Ivan: Not on your life!

Culture Note
Places for Antiquing
Some people go antiquing as a “hobby” (something enjoyable that people do in their free time). They look for interesting or valuable “antiques” (old objects that are not made any more). Some people collect the antiques for their own use, while others try to purchase valuable antiques at a low price so that they can sell them at a higher price and make a “profit” (money that one gets to keep in a business transaction).
There are many “antique shops,” or stores that specialize in antiques, but many people who enjoy antiquing enjoy the “hunt” (the process of looking for something). Instead of shopping at antique stores, they prefer to find the “pieces” (objects of interest) on their own. These people often go to “garage sales” (events where people put used objects in front of their home to sell them) and “estate sales” (garage sales that are held after people die), hoping to find a great “bargain” (something that is sold for less that it is worth).
Other people go antiquing at “flea markets,” which are large outdoor markets where many people bring objects that they want to sell. The prices at flea markets “tend to be” (are usually) higher than the prices at garage sales, but less than the prices in antique stores, because the flea market “vendors” (salespeople) do not have to pay the “overhead” (fixed costs, like rent and utilities) associated with a store location.
People who are “in the market for” (wanting to buy) higher-priced antiques generally shop at “auctions,” where more expensive objects are common. An auction is an event where many people “bid on” (say how much they are willing to pay for) objects, which are then sold to the “highest bidder” (the person who is willing to pay the most for something).
