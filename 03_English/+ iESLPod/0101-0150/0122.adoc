Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 122 – Packing Toiletries for a Trip.
This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 122. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.
Today’s podcast is about packing for a trip. Let’s go!
[start of story]
It was going to be my wife's 30th birthday, and I was surprising her with a trip to San Diego for the weekend. Since it was going to be a surprise, I needed to pack both of our bags before picking her up from work and hitting the road.
Packing my stuff was easy, of course. I knew that the hotel would have shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion, so I didn't pack any. I packed my wife’s brush, comb, hair dryer, nail clippers, and emery board. I made sure that I didn't forget any of her makeup: foundation, mascara, eye shadow, blush, and lipstick.
I had everything we needed for our little trip. I was sure my wife would be surprised, and I know she loves surprises!

Today we’re talking about going on a trip, and before going on a trip – going somewhere else – you have to “pack.” “To pack” (pack) means to put clothing in a bag or in a suitcase. A “suitcase” (suitcase) is a bag in the shape of a box that you put your clothing into to carry it when you’re going on a trip. Some of the things you need to pack are “toiletries.” “Toiletries” (toiletries) are all the things that you need for your teeth and for your hair and for washing and so forth.
In the story, my wife’s 30th birthday was coming up, and “I was surprising her with a trip to San Diego.” “To surprise” someone means to do something unexpected, something they don’t expect. I was going to surprise her by taking her on a trip to San Diego. “San Diego” is a city in California about a hundred miles south of Los Angeles. It takes about two hours to drive from my house here in Los Angeles to San Diego. San Diego is a popular place for people in Los Angeles to go for the weekend because it’s a smaller town and a very nice area.
The trip was going to be a surprise, so “I needed to pack both of our bags” – my suitcase and her suitcase – before “picking her up from work.” “To pick someone up” means to go to the place where that person is and to give him or her a ride in your car – to drive that person somewhere in your car. After I picked her up from work, we would be “hitting the road.” “To hit (hit) the road” means to begin your trip, to start travelling, to start driving. “What time are you going to hit the road tomorrow?” “Well, I have to be at work by eight o’clock, so I will hit the road at seven thirty.”
I said that “packing my stuff was easy, of course.” “My stuff” (stuff) here means my things. I knew the hotel would already have “shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion.” “Shampoo” (shampoo) is a liquid soap for washing your hair. “Conditioner” (conditioner) is what you can put on your hair after you use the shampoo to make your hair softer. I don’t use “conditioner.” I don’t use shampoo either, because I don’t have any hair. “Body lotion” is a kind of “lotion” (lotion), which is something you put on your skin to make it soft and smooth. “Body lotion” is for your body, “face lotion” is for your face, and so forth.
I had to pack my wife’s things, so I packed her “brush,” “comb,” and “hair dryer.” Both a “brush” (brush) and a “comb” (comb) are things that women and men can use to arrange their hair, to make their hair neat. A brush is wide and has many rows of what are called “bristles” that go through your hair. A comb is thin and flat with little pieces of plastic called “teeth” that also go through your hair. And a “hair dryer” – two words, (hair) (dryer) – is a little machine that blows hot air. It is like a heater that blows hot air to dry your wet hair after you wash it.
I also packed my wife’s “nail clippers” and “emery board.” “Nail (nail) clippers (clippers)” are for trimming or cutting your “nails,” which are the same as “fingernails.” Fingernails grow at the ends of your fingers, and “toenails” grow at the ends of your toes. And “to clip” means to cut. So, a “nail clipper” is for cutting your nails. An “emery board” – two words, (emery) (board) – is used to “file” your nails, or to make the edges of your nails smooth so there aren’t any rough parts.
(I have to say that I had no idea about many of these things; I had to ask my wife to explain them to me to do today’s episode. Most men don’t, I think, know much about these things.)
Finally, “I made sure that I didn’t forget any of her makeup.” “Makeup” (makeup) is a general word for all of the things that women and sometimes men put on their faces. I packed my wife’s “foundation,” “mascara,” and “eye shadow.” “Foundation” (foundation) can either be a powder, which is loose and dry, or it can be a liquid, which is wet. Foundation makes your skin look all the same color and very smooth-looking, and it is the first step in putting on makeup – that’s what my wife tells me.
”Mascara” (mascara) is the makeup that you put on your eyelashes. Your “eyelashes” (eyelashes) are the little hairs that grow out of your eyelids. Your “eyelid” is the skin that covers your eye when you close your eye. So, your eyelashes grow out of your eyelids, and you put mascara on your eyelashes to make them darker and to make them look longer. And “eye shadow” (shadow) is a powder that you put on your eyelids. Eye shadow comes in all different colors, I’m told.
I also packed her “blush” and “lipstick.” “Blush” (blush) is what you put on your cheeks. Your “cheeks” (cheeks) are the part of your face below your eyes, and some women use blush to make this area look more pink or red. And finally, there is “lipstick.” “Lipstick” (lipstick) goes on your lips, which are the parts of your mouth that are pink or red. Lipstick is most often a pink or red color, but it also comes in many other colors, as well.
I now had everything for our trip, and we were ready to go!
Now let’s listen to the story again, this time at a normal speed.

Culture Note
Women’s Toiletries Women often pack many “toiletries” (things that are used for cleaning oneself and/or making oneself more beautiful) when they travel. The ones “mentioned” (discussed; talked about) in today’s script are “just the beginning” (only a start; not a detailed list that includes everything). Most women use “deodorant” (a substance placed under one’s arms to prevent or cover bad smells) and/or “antiperspirant” (a substance placed under one’s arms to prevent or reduce sweat). Many women also use “talcum powder,” which is a white powder that smells nice and is put on one’s skin after bathing to “absorb” (soak up) any “moisture” (liquid). For the shower, women might pack “body wash” (liquid soap for the body) or an “exfoliating scrub” (a cream with many small, hard pieces that is rubbed against the skin to remove dead skin cells). A “toiletries kit” (a bag for holding toiletries) might also have a “razor” (a small tool with a plastic handle at one end and sharp metal blades at the other end, used to remove hair) and “shaving cream” (a foam used to soften hair and skin) so that the woman can shave her legs and “armpits” (the small area under one’s arm). Other common “cosmetics” (make-up) include “eye creams” (creams placed around one’s eyes to avoid wrinkles) and “sunscreen” (a cream used to provide protection from sun damage). Many women also pack an “eyelash curler” (a small, metal tool used to curl one’s eyelashes upward), “lip balm” (a clear substance applied to one’s lips to protect them and keep them moist), and “lip gloss” (a clear or slightly colored substance applied to one’s lips to make them shiny).
