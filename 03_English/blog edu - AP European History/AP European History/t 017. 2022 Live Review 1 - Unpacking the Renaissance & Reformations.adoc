==== 文艺复兴

今天，我们将带您踏上佛罗伦萨狭窄的鹅卵石街道之旅——米开朗基罗、马基雅维利、达芬奇, 以及著名的美第奇家族成员, 在 1400 年代后期走过的街道，那个时代被称为"文艺复兴时期"。

我们还将探讨一位德国僧侣, 如何挑战整个欧洲最强大的权威，并**通过一个被称为"宗教改革"的时代, 改变了历史的进程。**

大家好！我是凯蒂·兰西。我在佛罗里达州迈阿密的珊瑚礁高中任教。

大家好！我叫托德·比奇。我在明尼苏达州苹果谷的东景高中任教，那里是明尼阿波利斯的一个郊区。欢迎来到 AP 直播复习！

好的，在我们开始今天的内容时，我们将向您介绍我们计划教给您的内容, 以及我们的时间表。我们进行这些复习的目的, 是真正补充您今年在 AP 欧洲历史课程中所做的学习。

我们将在每节课中探讨重要的内容。我们将为您提供练习即将到来的 AP 考试的作业。我们也希望您能参与到家庭作业中。我们提供的练习, 是为了帮助您在考试中取得更大的成功。在接下来的每一节课中，我们将帮助您分析您给出的答案，我们将帮助您理解您正在学习的内容，并帮助您为 AP 考试做好准备。

最后，我们也希望这些复习课程, 能帮助您感受到一种社区感。全国各地以及世界各地的国际学校, 都有学生正在为即将到来的考试做准备。所以请记住，您并不孤单，每个人都在练习。希望我们的答案和内容片段, 能在接下来的课程中对您有所帮助。

在第一个学习周——第一、二、三和四节课——这是第一节课，我们的内容回顾将带您了解第一个时期，即 1450 年至 1648 年。今天，我们将讨论文艺复兴和宗教改革。这将是我们的两个内容片段。我们今天要分析的技能发展, 是如何回答简答题，也称为 SAQ。

然后对于家庭作业，我们将为您提供 SAQ 简答题的选择。您可以在屏幕上看到我们即将推出的第二、三和四节课的内容。您还可以看到, 每日 AP 复习视频也遵循着相同的结构。您可以看到技能发展，所以如果您想知道，“我什么时候能学到关于 LEQ 或 DBQ 的内容？”您可以看到我们即将推出这些内容。我们明天将讲解如何在论文段落中撰写背景。所以我们希望您能参加每一节课，这将有助于您为即将到来的考试做好准备。

当然。同样重要的是要提醒您，**我们不可能涵盖您的老师们全年已经涵盖的所有内容。所以我们只是想真正关注您在每个单元中需要的核心内容。**因此，您今天在这里看到的幻灯片是关于我们的内容片段将是什么。

好的，我们将从第一单元的"意大利文艺复兴"开始。您可以在屏幕上看到我们课程和考试描述的一部分。我们现在要讨论的历史发展是，包括彼特拉克在内的意大利**文艺复兴人文主义者, 促进了古典文学的复兴，并创造了研究古代文本的新方法。一些文艺复兴人文主义者, 也进一步发展了"世俗主义"和"个人主义"的价值观。**

快速看一下, 您可以看到的佛罗伦萨市和主教座堂的图像，以及那座建筑的重要性。我相信您的老师在年初已经讲过或确实讲过。因此，我们现在真正关注的是这座神奇的佛罗伦萨市，所有这些知识和学习都真正开始涌现。

您可以在图像中看到彼特拉克。他是我们的"人文主义之父"，所以我想让您看到他的形象。*#文艺复兴的真正特征是: 对回顾古希腊和古罗马的浓厚兴趣。他们研究文学和哲学，并通过回顾过去, 并将其带向前, 来发展关于人类和人性的新思想。#*

这实际上再次始于彼特拉克，您可以在右边的图像中看到他。彼特拉克认为我们生活在一个光辉的时代，作家和艺术家们将带来古典过去的荣耀——回顾古希腊和古罗马，并将事物带入文艺复兴时期的现在。

他强烈主张一种古典学术，这将成为文艺复兴的知识中心，它被称为**##人文主义。这是一项强调对希腊和拉丁文学进行"批判性研究"的研究计划。##它也重视人性和人类成就的价值。**

因此，随着这种促进古典文本复兴的运动，文艺复兴人文主义者真正重视的其他意识形态，如世俗主义和个人主义。因此，这些与人文主义紧密相连。*##人文主义者将他们的注意力集中在"现在"，因此在中世纪一直非常重要的"来世"变得不那么重要了。##对它的强调减少了。*

**"个人主义"也成为意大利的一个突出主题。哲学家们将撰写关于人类潜力的文章，**他们将根据个人应该追求或努力成为的那种人, 来发展自己的信仰。因此，这都是意大利文艺复兴的开始。

随着我们在文艺复兴时期向前发展，我们也看到了您在屏幕上看到的这个关键概念，即回顾古希腊和古罗马带来了对其政治制度的钦佩，并支持了一种叫做"公民人文主义"的复兴。我们稍后会讨论这个问题。

意大利城邦中的"公民人文主义"文化, **产生了关于个人应该如何表现, 以及统治者应该如何表现的世俗或非宗教模式。**我将给您一些关于这两者的例子。

因此，您可以在屏幕上看到图像。那是卡斯蒂廖内，由著名的——我在我的课堂上这样说——“忍者神龟”拉斐尔，伟大的文艺复兴艺术家拉斐尔所画。那是他的肖像。拉斐尔画了他的肖像这一事实, 真正表明了他在那个时代的重要性。

因此，我们正在研究"世俗的行为模式"。因此，当我们总体上看待文艺复兴时，我们看到公民人文主义的这种思想真正走到前台, 并变得非常重要。美第奇家族——从幕后和前台统治佛罗伦萨的非常强大的银行家族——伟大的洛伦佐，洛伦佐·德·美第奇，他以倡导这种叫做**"公民人文主义"的思想** 而闻名。

*这再次从古希腊中汲取，以那里的思想为模型。#它认为, 知识分子有责任参与政治, 并帮助社区。人们非常坚信，一个人必须不仅仅是被动的，他们必须主动行动，他们必须参与。#*

因此，当我们谈论个人行为时，您可以在屏幕上看到我们的卡斯蒂廖内写了**一本非常著名和广为人知的书，叫做《廷臣之书》。这实际上是一本关于如何成为理想绅士的培训手册。这是一本关于想要在社会上攀登的人的指南(成功学?)。**

它描述了绅士应该具备的广泛的学术背景，以及不同的特征，例如身体非常健康, 以及在数学、音乐和舞蹈等方面的技能。因此，这是一本非常畅销的书。它被翻译成多种语言，并在整个欧洲广泛阅读。因此，它确实非常有影响力。

从政治行为手册的思想来看，我认为使用**马基雅维利的《君主论》**作为我们的说明性例子非常重要。因此，这绝对是可以在文艺复兴时期找到的最佳例子。

在这本书中，**马基雅维利使用古典和当前的例子, 来论证有效的统治者需要具备的品质。**他这样做, 是**因为他亲自经历了佛罗伦萨二十多年的权力斗争。**我喜欢和我的学生一起读这本书，我们有时会谈论一些有趣的名言，比如**他认为, 统治者必须既像狐狸又像狮子——你需要狡猾和智慧的品质，但也需要力量和勇敢以及这些东西的品质。**

因此，显然，《君主论》仍然是政治学中非常重要的著作。它经久不衰，这些都来自文艺复兴时期的行为模式。

*在意大利文艺复兴之后，我们开始看到一场向北方的运动。因此，北方文艺复兴保留了更多的宗教焦点——比意大利文艺复兴更不世俗*——这导致了更多以人为中心的自然主义，它认为个人和日常生活是艺术表现的适当对象。

因此，我想你们大多数人, 可能都很熟悉意大利文艺复兴时期的艺术家，但艺术确实随着它的发展而发生了一些变化。我们将对意大利文艺复兴时期的艺术, 和北方文艺复兴时期的艺术, 进行一些比较。

因此，如果您有兴趣, 并且想要更多来自文艺复兴时期的特定作品的例子，您可以在屏幕上看到 AP 课堂中的一些 AP 每日视频，您可以去观看。因此，您可以查看并看到特定的艺术作品，它们在第二个视频中的 AP 每日 1.2 和 AP 每日 1.3 中。

因此，当我们比较意大利和北方文艺复兴时期的艺术时，在意大利，我们真正想谈论的是, 谁在为艺术买单。因此，**在意大利文艺复兴时期，最大的艺术赞助人之一是天主教会。天主教会委托创作了许多许多重要的作品。**我相信您的老师在您的学年开始时, 向您展示了这些作品。

您看到了像米开朗基罗的西斯廷教堂, 和他的《大卫》这样的作品，还有许多由天主教会出资的非常令人难以置信的艺术作品。**此外，我们将看到富裕的家庭也将赞助艺术家。**我们将看到美第奇家族将购买大量艺术品, 以及其他富裕的家庭。

在北方文艺复兴时期，我们看到了转变。我们看到, 我们仍然需要财富来购买艺术品，因此我们看到了将成为其中的一部分的富裕商人，*君主也将成为艺术的赞助人。*

**由于意大利文艺复兴时期, 对古希腊和古罗马的关注，我们有时也会看到艺术中描绘的主题有所不同。我们在那些艺术品中看到了许多神话人物，我们也看到了宗教人物和场景。**因此，这当然是意大利文艺复兴时期的一个非常重要的 focus。

*##当我们转向北方时，我们开始看到艺术中描绘的其他事物。我们看到了农民在他们的日常生活中做他们的日常事情，##这些都被认为是重要的，而我们在意大利文艺复兴时期并没有真正看到这一点。#我们看到了肖像和自然场景，人们家中的内部——家庭内部。并且由于宗教的强调，我们在北方看到了较少的裸体。#*

用于艺术的实际材料, 在意大利和北方文艺复兴时期之间也发生了变化。因此，*在意大利文艺复兴时期，我们看到了许多壁画。我们看到了大理石被用作雕塑的媒介，因为意大利的大理石非常丰富。*

**当我们转向北方时，这种情况也发生了变化。我们看到了大量的油画，**这对于北方来说非常重要，*以及木材也将成为一种使用的媒介。我们从北方文艺复兴时期得到了木刻。*

*#意大利非常注重科学比例，当我们转向北方时，我们真正将 focus 转移到色彩和细节上。#*

这两种艺术运动也有共同之处。它们都有宗教题材。它们对两者来说都非常重要。我们还看到它们都将使用来自意大利文艺复兴的新"线性透视"，这将在它们之间共享。

如果您正在寻找更具体的艺术作品，请查看幻灯片上的 AP 每日视频。它们也都使用自然主义，并且肯定有一些相似之处。

这也是我们在课程中第一次谈论"比较的历史推理过程"的技能。因此，像这样的图表, 是思考您的细节和证据的好方法，如果您正在比较和对比两个不同的事物。

我们想谈论的关于文艺复兴的最后一件事, 与基督教人文主义的思想有关。基督教人文主义, 体现在许多这些基督教人文主义者的著作中，特别是我们稍后会谈到的伊拉斯谟。

**#这些思想家们正在真正地接受文艺复兴的思想，他们正在利用它来进行宗教改革。#**我们将看到这将如何直接导致托德稍后要谈论的内容。

因此，我们有这些北方文艺复兴时期的人文主义者，让我们花一点时间看一下我们在这里的图像，因为其中一个我将要谈论——不是马上，但我们将要谈论——**托马斯·莫尔爵士。**他是一位英国人文主义者，*他写了一本书，《乌托邦》。*

您可以在这里看到，这是他对乌托邦岛屿的设想。当然，这已经成为我们词汇中的一个词。

因此，当我们谈论北方文艺复兴时期的人文主义者时，我们想从伊拉斯谟开始。伊拉斯谟是我们的人文主义王子。他绝对是最著名的北方人文主义者。他成为了一位非常著名的改革家，*#他想要真正找到一种方法, 将古典思想——如"人文主义"和"公民美德"——与来自《圣经》的基督教思想，如爱和虔诚结合在一起。#*

因此，他不仅像意大利人文主义者那样回顾古典来源，他还回顾了来自教会神父的原始古代基督教来源。因此，他试图真正地将这两件事结合在一起。

伊拉斯谟还创建了希腊语版的《新约》，他以一部讽刺作品《愚人颂》而闻名。在这部讽刺作品中，*他真正地批评了宗教和政治机构。*

**他认为教育是改革的关键。**他创建了《新约》的拉丁语译本。由于他对天主教会的批评，他被指控为马丁·路德孵化的蛋。因此，他对天主教会的批评——他当然不会孤单，并且会有其他改革家会接受他的最初思想。托德将在稍后谈论这些。

然后回到我们开始时的图像，托马斯·莫尔是一位英国人文主义者，他在 1516 年写了《*乌托邦*》。在这里，他描述了他的理想之地，对吧？这就是这个词在我们语言中的含义——*他谈论的是一个在欧洲之外的岛屿，所有儿童都接受古典教育，那里没有贫困或不和，政府已经解决了所有问题。*

**那里有宗教宽容，没有异议或分歧。**因此，当然，他的乌托邦思想已经成为一个我们现在用来形容我们对事物应该如何的完美想法的词。

好的，嗨！好的，谢谢，凯蒂。

因此，我们将从"文艺复兴"时期, 进入"宗教改革"时期，凯蒂通过谈论人文主义者, 将我们引入了这一时期。

==== 宗教改革 -> 诞生新教

接下来我们将从文艺复兴时期进入宗教改革时代，凯蒂通过谈论人文主义者，某种程度上已经引领我们进入了这个主题。

*在宗教改革时代，我们将会看到像马丁·路德和约翰·加尔文这样的改革者，他们开始对天主教会提出批评。他们所批评的内容其实早已有人讨论过，但现在将由有学识的人真正深入探讨这些问题，并以一种更为公开的方式展开讨论。*

改革者路德、加尔文等人, 将对基督教教义和实践, 提出新的诠释。

我们先从这里开始。这是教皇尤利乌斯二世的画像，他担任教皇一职。在本课程的这部分内容中，你需要了解的一点是，*教会是主要的权威机构。它不仅是宗教权威，在欧洲大部分地区还扮演着世俗权威的角色。教会拥有巨大的政治权力，并且这种权力广泛渗透到人们生活的方方面面。*

在很多方面，教会的影响是积极的，但现在我们将看到这些新改革者是如何对其中一些方面提出批评的。

教皇尤利乌斯二世, 原名朱利亚诺·德拉·罗韦雷——这是他的意大利名字。他从1503年开始担任教皇，直至1513年去世。这幅肖像据说是他在1510年左右的雕刻像。

正如我提到的，**在16世纪早期，天主教会是所有社会阶层的生活中心。大多数人都非常虔诚。**凯蒂之前引领我们讨论了从中世纪到文艺复兴的转变。*中世纪的思维方式, 在很大程度上仍占据主导，#当时人们的日常生活中，很大一部分时间都在思考"来世", 以及如何为"来世"做准备。#*

与此同时，当时人们对教会也有诸多不满。像凯蒂提到的人文主义者这样的受过教育的平信徒、城市居民、村民、工匠，甚至一些教会官员自身，都从教会内部审视并指出：“我们需要做出一些改进。”

他们所指出的教会混乱和弊端, 有哪些迹象呢？其一是**神职人员的不道德行为。**当你想到社区里的神职人员，比如你当地的神职人员时，*人们将他们视为行为榜样，是我们仰望并试图效仿的对象。#如果他们行为不道德，我们就会开始质疑：“为什么他们可以那样行事，却告诉我们要以不同的方式行事(不能那样做)？”#*

接下来是**神职人员的缺勤现象、兼职现象, 以及知识匮乏的问题。**这里的第二点“神职人员无知”存在一定的因果关系，*因为我们刚刚从中世纪晚期的黑死病和瘟疫中走出来*（事实上，有些影响仍在持续）。

*#在瘟疫期间，照顾病人的是神职人员、牧师和修女。随着瘟疫逐渐消退，这些地方教区的牧师和修女越来越少。为了应对这一情况，天主教会几乎是在仓促地开展关于如何成为神职人员的"速成培训"#*（如果你愿意这样理解的话）。

**正因如此，他们不懂拉丁语。**当他们站在众人面前试图用拉丁语主持弥撒却又不懂拉丁语时，效果自然很糟糕。这就是问题所在。

*还有缺勤和兼职现象。“缺勤”正如其字面意思——他们不在岗，没有出现。而“兼职”则是因为神职人员短缺，一些人需要负责不同城镇的教区事务，这也引发了不满。*

最后，*作为教会成员，##神职人员享有特权——他们不必纳税，也不必承担许多普通人必须承担的事务。##这也引发了人们的不满情绪。*

好的，我们快速转换一下话题。刚才这些内容, 为你提供了当时的一些背景情况。现在我们要谈谈其中的一些关键人物。

你看到的这幅图是一幅插图，描绘了多明我会传教士约翰·台彻尔, 在教堂内售卖"赎罪券"的场景。这是一幅很生动的图像，你可以看到桌上的硬币、正在收集硬币的牧师，还有一张纸或便条。人们排着队，似乎都迫不及待。

*赎罪券是对罪孽的宽恕。#你不仅可以为自己的罪孽获得宽恕，也可以为家族中已故的亲人赎罪。人们认为这些亲人可能被困在炼狱里，无法升入天堂，而购买赎罪券, 则是将他们拯救进天堂的一种方式。#*

可以说，这是一台赚钱机器。在某种程度上，这是天主教会在人们可能并不富裕的时期, 筹集资金的一种手段。

接下来我们谈谈**马丁·路德。**他是一名奥古斯丁会修士，属于德国的奥古斯丁修会。通过对《新约》的研究，**#他开始相信“因信称义”——仅凭信仰即可获得救赎。这与天主教会所教导的截然不同，#**他个人也是经历了一番心路历程才得出这一结论。

**他认为，##是《圣经》向人们启示了上帝，而非"天主教会的传统和迷信"。##因此，他将与教会的一些教义决裂。**我刚刚提到教会是权威机构，因此这一举动将引发分歧，并引起关注。

在他所处的时代，教皇利奥十世批准发行一种特殊的赎罪券，用于资助罗马圣彼得大教堂的建设——这是世界上最大的基督教大教堂。正因如此，需要大量资金。

在德意志诸邦，**这些"赎罪券"的销售**由台彻尔负责，他承诺, 购买赎罪券将完全赦免购买者或其亲人在炼狱中的罪孽。他**甚至有一句宣传口号：“当钱箱中的硬币叮当响，炼狱中的灵魂便得释放。”**这就像是14至15世纪教会的一种营销手段。

**在这种情况下，德国的资金不断流向罗马，**人们的不满情绪也与日俱增。

这幅路德张贴《九十五条论纲》的图片带有卡通风格，我每次看到都会发笑，因为你最常看到的场景是——教堂的门只是人们张贴公告的地方，人们可以在那里阅读公告。

图中描绘的是他仿佛在说“我要把这个贴在这里”，而旁观者则像是在说“天哪，他真的要这么做”。我认为实际情况可能并非如此，但这幅作品通过这种轻松的方式让我们发笑。

我们现在来谈谈这种抗议式的改革。**路德对赎罪券深感不安，**随着他不断思考，他又提出了其他不满。*这些不满便构成了《九十五条论纲》的内容。*

作为回应，*他在10月31日——万圣节前夜，将"论纲"(大字报)钉在了维滕贝格的教堂门上。因为万圣节前夜的次日是圣徒日，他知道人们会来教堂，从而看到这些论纲。借助印刷术，他得以迅速将"论纲"用拉丁语和德语方言印刷出来，使其广泛传播，思想也得以迅速扩散。*

路德继续写作，敦促教会进行改革，他希望看到改变。他的作品遭到罗马方面的谴责，他本人也面临被逐出教会的威胁。被逐出教会是一件大事——这就像是被逐出社区，遭到排斥。

1521年，当时的神圣罗马帝国皇帝查理五世, 召开了一次“帝国议会”（即由显赫贵族和神职人员组成的会议），地点在德国的沃尔姆斯市。他召路德出席。

路德到场后，他们问：“这是你写的吗？这是你做的吗？”他回答：“是的，是我做的。”他们希望他放弃（即收回他所写和所说的内容），但他拒绝了，尽管面临被逐出教会的威胁。

这一事件被称为“沃尔姆斯宗教会议”，**##它导致了德意志诸邦的宗教分裂。##哈布斯堡家族的查理五世, 后来于1555年签署了《奥格斯堡和约》**——这是历史上你必须知道的一个日期。当你知道1555年的《奥格斯堡和约》时，你就可以思考之前和之后发生了什么，这非常重要。

*#该和约规定，新教（这种抗议形式的宗教）现在被允许存在，该地区的德国诸侯, 可以选择自己的领地是"天主教"领地, 还是现在所称的"路德教"领地。#*

*居住在这些领地的人们, 也需要皈依该领地诸侯所选择的宗教。*

那么在地图上这是什么样的呢？我真希望能把地图放大，但你可以看到，这种粉红色（橙色）区域, 主要是**"路德新教"地区。你可以看到斯堪的纳维亚国家——挪威、瑞典、芬兰，还有勃兰登堡（这是普鲁士的一部分）。**

*你可以看到它是如何传播的——荷兰也是如此，然后向南延伸至德国南部和奥地利部分地区*。但你也会看到这些淡黄色区域是信仰摇摆不定的地区，而那些地区将继续保持天主教信仰。

因此，**位于因斯布鲁克的哈布斯堡家族所在地奥地利，仍然是坚定的天主教地区，并一直保持天主教信仰。**于是你开始看到曾经完全由天主教控制的局面被打破。

**德国境内第一个正式接受"宗教改革"的地区, 是**克里斯蒂安三世统治下的**丹麦和挪威王国。这将是由国家支持的路德教。*

虽然在丹麦，改宗过程顺利且迅速，但在挪威北部和冰岛，由于阻力的存在，改宗过程更为缓慢，但最终还是完成了。

在瑞典，古斯塔夫·瓦萨帮助将新教引入该地区。*随后，我们开始看到其他改革者涌现。*

*基于上帝的"绝对主权"和"全能"这一理念，#瑞士人约翰·加尔文得出结论：人类无法自救。路德说“你的救赎仅通过信仰而来”，而约翰·加尔文则说“实际上，我认为人类无能为力，上帝在创世之初就已决定谁将得救、谁将不得救”。#*

**#这一理念被称为“预定论”#，**它与约翰·加尔文, 以及我们所称的加尔文宗相关联。

**加尔文随后在瑞士日内瓦建立了自己的城市政府，**并试图在日内瓦规范人们的行为，以在人间建立一个神圣的城市。因此，*任何《圣经》中没有记载的事情都不允许做。(基督教原教旨主义?)*

**在加尔文统治的日内瓦，打牌、跳舞和其他娱乐活动都被禁止。**他的一位学生名叫约翰·诺克斯，是一位在日内瓦跟随加尔文学习的牧师。他帮助苏格兰议会在那里建立了**加尔文宗教会——这是苏格兰的官方国教会，即长老会。**

因此，你可以在地图上看到苏格兰地区的紫色区域，而英格兰则是圣公宗的颜色，这为后来的紧张局势、战争和冲突埋下了伏笔。

好的。我很高兴听到你提到“关键日期”这个概念。你知道，*我不希望AP欧洲史课程只是让学生记忆大量日期，但我认为他们确实需要了解一些重要日期，并在课程中建立时间顺序感，这非常重要。*

我很高兴你提到这一点，因为这是我一直在和学生强调的。尤其是考试临近，我们希望确保你记住一些关键日期。

==== 题目练习

我们希望确保你对事件发生的时间顺序, 有清晰的认识，因为你可能需要在考试的不同部分展示这一点。今天我们要讨论的是SAQ（短回答问题）。

你将回答三个问题，有40分钟时间完成这三个问题，占总分的20%。我们将在后续课程中, 详细介绍考试形式。

但这是你需要知道的。*当你回答这些问题时，你实际上是在分析历史学家的解释，审视历史资料，并思考关于历史的命题。*

这些都是你需要完成的任务。问题将为你提供"展示所学知识"的机会。我相信你们很多人已经在自己的课堂上练习过这些内容。

SAQ可能包括文本、图像、带有统计数据的图表, 或地图。最后，你需要在最后一个必答SAQ的两个选项中选择一个，该问题将聚焦于你可以选择的不同时间段。

一般来说，SAQ的情况如下——托德，如果你愿意继续的话——不，谢谢你，你已经在那里了。

你需要从四个问题中, 回答三个。

**SAQ 1是必答题，**每个参加AP考试的学生都必须回答，*其中将包含一个或可能两个二手资料的解释。 这些通常是历史学家对某一重要历史事件的解读，* 聚焦于1600年至2001年之间的发展或进程。这是SAQ 1的时间范围。

**SAQ 2也是必答题，**每个学生都需要回答，**内容将是一手资料，**时间范围同样在1600年至2001年之间。*很可能是一幅图像，但也可能是文本、图表或该时期的地图。* 因此，SAQ 2的内容将是一手资料。

**对于SAQ 3，你可以在两个问题中选择一个，选择你认为能够更好、更有力回答的那个。**第一个问题将涵盖1450年至1648年的时间段，第二个问题将涵盖1648年至1815年——即AP欧洲史课程的前两个时间段。

**SAQ 4将涵盖课程的后期内容，**时间范围大致从1815年到课程所涉及的现代时期。

**SAQ 3和4没有资料，**我们稍后会展示一个例子。它们只是你需要完成的任务，SAQ 3和4不附带材料。但你可以选择自己更喜欢的那个问题。

托德将详细解析SAQ，并进一步讨论其格式和所需技能。

好的，**当你遇到短回答问题（SAQ）时，我们需要讨论这些“任务词”。**这是评估内容和技能的直接任务。

每个SAQ有三个部分：A、B和C，每个部分各占1分。因此，我们首先需要做的, 是理解题目要求，以及每个部分所使用的"任务动词"。

**任务词可能是“识别”，这意味着指出或提供关于特定主题的信息，无需详细阐述或解释。**然而，你需要用完整的句子书写，不应以短语或项目符号列表的形式回答，这样效果不好，必须使用完整的句子。

*任务词也可能是“描述”，即提供特定主题的相关特征，只需告诉我们发生了什么。*

**或者是“#解释#”，**这一要求更高。**#你需要提供关于关系、过程、模式、立场、情况或结果如何发生, 或为何发生的信息，需使用证据和/或推理。(即你真正来做论文, 因果分析, 麦肯锡分析思维, 来得出你自己的结论, 很棒!)#**换句话说，*告诉我们发生了什么，以及如何发生、为何发生或由于什么而发生。*

在考试中回答短回答问题时，你需要为每个回答标注A、B、C部分。因此，使用提示语的主干来回应问题。

当回答“解释”类提示时，确保包含“如何”“为何”或“因为”等词汇。你已经陈述了某件事，比如“这已经发生”，确保补充说明：“这发生是因为……”或“这就是为什么这件事在此时发生”。

举个可能的任务示例：
A部分要求解释, 16世纪英国的历史状况如何导致政治变革。同样，内容上你需要了解16世纪的英国，才能大致知道他们所谈论的政治变革是什么。

这是一个关于如何回应问题主干的示例回答，同样是使用提示语的主干来回应问题。

开始写作时可以这样：“16世纪英国的历史状况导致政治变革，因为……”或“由于……”，然后加入你的回答和思考，举例也会很有帮助。

*我们也鼓励你使用我们称为“T-E-A”的结构：T代表主题句（Topic Sentence），E代表证据和例子（Evidence and Example），A代表分析（Analysis）。(#思维分析模型, 你用金字塔原理, 麦肯锡方法就行了.#)*

因此，当你构思段落回答时，需要具备这种结构——**主题句、证据、例子。**有些老师可能教过你使用**CRE结构(模型)，即主张（Claim）、推理（Reasoning）、例子（Example），这也是个好方法。**

无论你的老师教过哪种结构，请使用它。这是凯蒂和我在课堂上使用的模型结构，因此我们在此推荐。这是一种最佳实践，适用于短回答问题, 和我们将在后续复习中讨论的论文回答。

我认为凯蒂将开始带大家了解一个二手资料的SAQ示例。

好的，你在屏幕上看到的, 是一位历史学家对法国大革命事件的简短分析。让我们快速通读一遍： +
“如果我们从查理一世统治下的内战开始算起，直到1688年威廉三世遇刺，英国的革命时期可以说持续了近50年。这50年的努力，除了建立"现行宪法"外，没有其他真正和永久的目标。这部宪法是欧洲现存的正义和道德伟大的最杰出丰碑。
人类思想中引发英国革命的同一股思潮，也是1789年法国革命的起因。
两者都属于社会秩序进步中的新时代——"代议制政府"的建立，这是人类努力的方向。”

当你试图理解作者在这段文字中的观点时，学生需要阅读这段话，理解作者的论点，然后才能回答与之相关的问题。

第一个任务A是“描述”，题目要求：“描述作者关于文中所讨论的革命的一个论点。”
因此，你需要具备历史解释的技能——能够阅读并理解作者提出的论点。

然后是任务B，*要求：“识别资料中未提及的一个证据，以支持作者关于代议制政府的主张。”(#即你提出新的证据, 来支持对方的观点.#)*
因此，你需要思考自己对该时期的了解，哪些内容可以实际支持文中作者的观点，即你掌握的历史知识是什么。

任务C则要求更深入思考，题目是：*“解释你所知道的历史知识中，作者关于法国大革命观点的一个局限性。”*
因此，你需要利用对该主题的了解进行解释——不仅仅是识别，还要深入分析作为学生所**学过的关于法国大革命的知识，如何削弱作者的论点。(#即犹如和网上辩论, 提出证据, 来驳倒对方#)**

这是三个截然不同的任务，你确实需要花时间阅读文章，并认真思考作者的论点, 以及你对作者所提及时期的了解。

谢谢，凯蒂。

SAQ 2将是一手资料，在这个例子中，他们提供了一幅图像。当提供图像时，通常也会给出资料来源说明。

我告诉我的学生：“先读资料来源说明，让自己进入相应的思维模式。” 这幅图是法国艺术家描绘的1667年科尔伯特向路易十四介绍皇家科学院成员的场景。

如果你已经完成了阅读，就会知道科尔伯特和路易十四是谁。如果你的学生像我的学生一样，可能会想：“天哪，这是很久以前的事了。” 这就是复习的意义——这就是为什么要复习，为什么要看我们的视频。回去复习，确保你关注科尔伯特和路易十四的相关内容。

然后我们来看这幅图像，场景是在凡尔赛宫，我们开始思考：“哦，这一定是路易十四，对吧？他是坐着的国王，手持权杖，象征着他是掌权者。有人在引荐——这是皇家科学院，所以我们看到这里挂着的地球仪、地图等物品。”

这为我们提供了图像信息，现在我们来看任务。
任务
A是要求“描述图像描绘科学革命显著特征的一种方式”。要回答这个问题，我得先知道科学革命的主要特点是什么，以及如何将这些特点与图像中的内容联系起来。比如，图像中展示的皇家科学院成员围绕着科学仪器（如地球仪、地图、望远镜等）进行研究和讨论，体现了科学革命时期对实证观察、实验研究和知识系统化的重视，这些仪器象征着人类通过理性探索自然规律的科学精神，反映了科学革命中科学机构的建立和科学协作的兴起这一显著特征。

B任务是“描述路易十四委托绘制这幅画的可能目的”。艺术家是受画面的主要人物路易十四委托或资助的，那么路易十四为什么要做这样的事呢？可能是为了彰显自己对科学的支持与赞助，通过将自己塑造为科学发展的庇护者形象，来提升王室的威望和文化影响力，向臣民和其他国家展示法国在科学领域的领先地位和繁荣景象，巩固自身作为开明君主的统治合法性，同时也激励更多学者为王室和国家服务。

C任务是“解释图像中所示的发展在启蒙运动时期如何变化或延续”。我们知道科学革命引领了启蒙运动，现在这个问题直接询问这些发展在时间上的变化或延续。例如，图像中所体现的科学探索精神和对理性的推崇在启蒙运动时期得到了延续，并且进一步发展。科学革命时期奠定的科学方法和实证精神成为启蒙运动思想家批判传统权威、构建新的社会政治理论的基础。启蒙运动时期，科学知识更加普及，科学与哲学紧密结合，思想家们不仅继续探索自然科学，还将理性主义应用于社会、政治、伦理等各个领域，推动了启蒙运动对人类社会全面革新的追求，这是对科学革命所开启的理性传统的延续与深化。同时，启蒙运动时期出现了更多的学术团体和公共知识分子，科学交流的范围更加广泛，从宫廷主导逐渐向社会大众扩散，这是科学发展在传播方式和社会基础上的变化。

我很喜欢这幅图像，它很好地将历史人物和科学发展的场景结合在一起，直观地展现了那个时代的特征。

正如之前所说，这前两个SAQ是你们必须完成的。接下来我们看SAQ 3和4，它们是直接的任务题，但不像SAQ 2那样参考历史学家的解释或一手资料。SAQ 3将只有这些直接的任务，没有材料。屏幕上显示的是最近AP考试中的一个例子。

题目要求：
A) 描述1450年至1700年期间, 宗教在欧洲日常生活中作用的一个具体变化实例。 +
这里我们要关注“变化”的推理过程。

B任务则从另一面提问，要求：
B) 描述宗教作用的一个具体延续实例。
这是你们在课堂上肯定练习过的推理过程之一——事物在变化，但有些也保持不变。

在我们的内容部分，已经讨论了宗教方面的一些重大变化，那么B任务中宗教有什么不变的呢？

C是更深层次的解释，要求：
C) 用1450年至1700年的一个具体例子，解释政治权威如何试图控制宗教信仰或实践。
我的学生很喜欢这个SAQ，它非常直接，真正考验你们的知识，你们有机会展示自己所知。但要记住，C部分不仅仅是列举或指出一个试图控制的政治权威，而是要解释这个政治权威如何尝试控制，甚至为什么这么做，需要更深入的分析。

正如凯蒂提到的，这是一个可以选择的题目，没有需要查看的材料或来源，这些只是直接的问题，但你可以选择：“我想回答这些早期的问题还是一组后期的问题？”

以下是后期的一组题目，A任务是：
A) 描述1900年至1945年期间国家在欧洲日常生活中作用的一个具体变化实例。
你会发现“描述一个具体的变化实例”有很多相似之处，但我们在内容上有所不同，这是后期的内容。

那么B任务是：
B) 描述1945-2000年期间西欧国家在日常生活中作用的一个具体变化实例。
现在，我需要你注意这里提到了“西欧”，所以你要确保关注每个单词，确保回答符合问题要求。

C任务是：
C) 用1945年至2000年的一个具体例子，解释东欧国家如何试图限制个人权利。
这里的C任务和上面的C提示一样，是“解释”任务，但现在我们把地区聚焦在东欧国家，所以要确保关注问题的每个小部分。

但你可以选择：“我想做早期的还是晚期的？”然后你就可以坐下来完成A、B、C任务。

当然。托德，如果你不介意，我还想强调一件我认为非常重要的事情，那就是对于考试中的每个问题，学生真的需要花时间确保自己认真阅读了问题。

我知道考试临近，人们会有很多肾上腺素，有时会有快速答题的倾向。如果你这样做，并且错过了像“西方”或“东方”这样的重要词汇，那么如果你提供的证据不符合问题的实际要求，就不能算作有效证据。

在AP考试中，仔细阅读提示并真正思考提示的要求是非常非常重要的，因为我知道大家有快速答题的倾向。

好的，我们想给你们提供练习机会。我知道考试临近，所以如果你在电脑或笔记本电脑上观看，可以拿起手机扫描二维码，或者欢迎你输入屏幕上看到的短网址，因为我们有一个谷歌云端硬盘，里面有多个练习内容。

今天的练习是短回答问题，供你练习。在下一次课程中，我们要做的是真正示范答案，托德会再次回顾本周内容以及我们接下来的方向。

是的，再强调一次——你显然可以暂停视频，但这是二维码或网址。

这是我们AP Live第一周的学习内容。今天是第1节——我们对文艺复兴、宗教改革进行了内容回顾，我们讨论了SAQ并进行了拆解。

正如凯蒂刚才指出的，你的作业是写SAQ。明天——或者更准确地说，下一节课——我应该说是第2节，内容是关于专制主义、宪政主义，然后我们会看一些作为作业布置的SAQ示例。我们会深入分析，告诉你为什么它得分或不得分。

然后你的技能提升部分是我们将开始看论文回答，我们会一步一步来——如何为LEQ（长论文问题）和DBQ（文献分析题）构建背景介绍和论点。

所以作业就是写背景和论点——那些背景/论点段落。

有什么好策略让我们进入状态吗？我们会和你一起完成这八节复习课，我们会让你们做好充分准备。我们很兴奋，因为我们知道你们在这一切中都会表现得非常出色。

当然。

好的，凯蒂，非常感谢你。

是的，也谢谢你。你知道在意大利人们怎么称呼假面条吗？

我不知道，托德。意大利怎么说？

是“impasta”（音似“重要的是”）！凯蒂，“impasta”——大家都知道这个！“impasta”！

我们应该提醒大家他们要经历八节充满糟糕爸爸笑话的课程吗？我们应该吗？

谁说它们糟糕了？

谁说它们糟糕了？

保重，我们期待很快见到你们。保重，谢谢大家，再见！

Today we're going to take you on a journey through the narrow, cobbled streets of Florence—the same streets where Michelangelo, Machiavelli, Leonardo, and the well-known members of the Medici family walked in the late 1400s, a time known as the Renaissance.

We'll also explore how a German monk challenged the most powerful authority in all of Europe and changed the course of history through a time known as the Age of Reformation.

Hi everyone! I'm Katie Lancey. I teach at Coral Gables Senior High School, which is in Miami, Florida.

Hi everybody! My name is Todd Beach. I teach at East View High School in Apple Valley, Minnesota, which is a suburb of Minneapolis. And welcome to AP Live Review!

All right, so as we get started today, we're going to kind of talk you through what we're going to plan to teach you and what our schedule is going to be. Our purpose in these reviews is really to supplement the learning that you have done this year in your AP European History course.

We are going to explore essential content in each lesson. We're going to give you assignments to practice for the upcoming AP exam. We're also going to hope that you will engage in the homework. The practice that we're providing is to help you be more successful on the exam. And in each succeeding session, we're going to help you unpack the answers that you've given, and we're going to help you understand what you're learning and help you prepare for the AP test.

And finally, we also want these review sessions to help you feel a sense of community. There are students all across the country and from international schools around the world who are all getting ready for this exam that's right around the corner. So remember that you're not alone, and everybody's practicing. And hopefully, our answers and our content pieces will help you as we go through these next sessions.

During this first learning week—sessions one, two, three, and four—this is session number one, and our content review is going to take you through the very first period, that's 1450 to 1648. And today, we're going to talk about Renaissance and Reformations. Those will be our two content pieces. The skill development we're going to unpack today is how to respond to the short answer question, also known as the SAQ.

And then for homework, we will give you a choice of SAQ short answer questions to write. You can see what we have upcoming for session two, session three, and session four on the screen. And you can see also that the daily AP review videos kind of follow the same structure for us. You can see the skill development, so if you're wondering, "When will I learn about LEQ or the DBQ?" you can see that we have that coming up. We have how to write your context in the thesis paragraph on deck for tomorrow. So we hope that you'll join us for each session, and that will help you prepare for your upcoming exam.

Absolutely. It's also important to remind you that we can't possibly cover everything that your teachers have already covered all year. So we're just trying to really focus on the essential content that you need in each of these units. And so you see this slide up here today about what our content pieces are going to be.

All right, so we're going to start in Unit 1 with the Italian Renaissance. And you can see up on the screen a piece of our Course and Exam Description. And the historical development that we're going to talk about now is that Italian Renaissance humanists, including Petrarch, promoted a revival in classical literature and created new approaches to ancient texts. Some Renaissance humanists also furthered the values of secularism and individualism.

And take a look real quick at that image you can see of the city of Florence and the Duomo, and how important that building was. I'm sure your teacher has talked about it or did talk about it at the beginning of the year. And so we're really focusing in right now on this amazing city of Florence, where all of this knowledge and learning really starts to kind of emerge.

You can see on the image there we have Petrarch. He is our father of humanism, and so I wanted you to see his image. The Renaissance is really characterized by this deep interest in looking back at ancient Greece and ancient Rome. They look at literature and philosophy, and there are new ideas about humans and human nature that are developed by looking back at the past and bringing that forward.

And this really again begins with Petrarch, who you see there in the image on the right. Petrarch believed that we were living in this glorious era where writers and artists would bring forward the glory of the classical past—looking back at ancient Greece and ancient Rome and bringing things forward into the present during the Renaissance.

He advocated strongly for a kind of classical scholarship, and that would become the intellectual centerpiece of the Renaissance, and it's called humanism. This was a program of study that emphasized the critical study of Greek and Latin literature. And it also valued the worthiness of human nature and human accomplishments.

So along with this promoting of the revival in classical texts, there's also other ideologies that Renaissance humanists really value, like secularism and individualism. And so these are very closely intertwined with humanism. Humanists focus their attention on the present, and so the afterlife that had been so important in the Middle Ages kind of became less important. There's less of an emphasis on that.

And individualism also becomes a prominent theme in Italy. Philosophers will write about the potential of man, and they'll develop their own beliefs based on the kind of person an individual should aim or strive to be. And so this is all sort of the beginning of the Italian Renaissance.

As we move forward in the Renaissance, we also see this key concept that you see on the screen, and that is looking back at ancient Greece and ancient Rome brought this admiration for its political institutions, and it supported a revival of something called civic humanism. And we'll talk about that in a moment.

And the civic humanist culture in the Italian city-states produced secular or non-religious models for how individuals should behave and also for political behavior—how rulers should behave. And I'll give you a couple of examples of both of those.

So you can see the image on your screen. That's Castiglione, painted by the famous—I do this in my class—"ninja turtle" Raphael, the great Renaissance artist Raphael. And that's his portrait. And the very fact that Raphael painted his portrait really shows that he was important during this time.

So we're looking at models of behavior that are secular. And so when we're looking at the Renaissance in general, we see this idea of civic humanism really come to the forefront and be very important. And the Medici family—the very powerful banking family that ruled Florence from behind the scenes and out front as well—Lorenzo the Magnificent, Lorenzo de' Medici, he was very well known for being an advocate of this idea called civic humanism.

And this again gets pulled forward from ancient Greece, modeled on the ideas from there. It's the belief that it's really an intellectual's duty to be involved in politics and to help the community. It was very strongly believed that someone had to be more than just passive in society, that they had to act and they had to take part.

So when we're talking about individual behavior, our Castiglione that you can see there on the screen wrote a very, very famous and well-known book called *The Book of the Courtier*. And this was really a training manual on how to be an ideal gentleman. It was a how-to book for somebody who wanted to kind of climb socially.

And it described the broad academic background that a gentleman should have, along with different traits like being really physically fit and skills in things like math and music and dance. So this was quite a bestseller. It was translated into many languages, and it was widely read throughout Europe. So it was really very influential.

And from the ideas of manuals for political behavior, I think it's really important to use as our illustrative example Machiavelli's *The Prince*. So it's definitely the best example that can be found during the Renaissance.

In this book, Machiavelli uses classical and current examples to argue about the qualities that effective rulers need to have. And he did this because he personally lived through power struggles in Florence for over two decades. And I like to read this with my students, and we talk sometimes about the little fun quotes, like he believed that a ruler had to be both like a fox and like a lion—that you need qualities of cunning and intelligence but also qualities of strength and bravery and those kinds of things.

So obviously, *The Prince* is still a really important work in political science. It's endured today, and these come out of models for behavior during the Renaissance.

After the Renaissance in Italy, we start to see a movement into the North. And so the Northern Renaissance retains more of a religious focus—more less secular than the Italian Renaissance—and that resulted in more human-centered naturalism that considered individuals and everyday life appropriate objects of artistic representation.

So I think most of you from your classes are probably quite familiar with the artists of the Italian Renaissance, but art really changes some as it moves. And we're going to do a little comparison between art in the Italian Renaissance and art during the Northern Renaissance.

So if you're interested and you want more examples of specific works from the Renaissance, you can see on the screen that there's some AP Daily videos in AP Classroom that you can go watch. So you can look and see the specific works of art, and they're in AP Daily 1.2 and AP Daily 1.3 in the second videos.

So as we're looking at a comparison of Italian and Northern Renaissance art, in Italy, we really want to talk about who's paying for the art. So in the Italian Renaissance, one of the biggest patrons of the art was the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church was commissioning many, many important works. And I'm sure that your teachers showed you those at the beginning of your school year.

You saw things like Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel and his *David*, and there's so many really incredible works of art that are paid for by the Catholic Church. Also, we have wealthy families that are going to patronize the artists. We're going to see the Medici family that will purchase a lot of art and other wealthy families as well.

And in the Northern Renaissance, we see a shift. We see that we still need wealth to buy the art, so we see wealthy merchants that are going to be a part of that, and also monarchs are going to be the patrons of the arts.

We also see a bit of a difference sometimes in subjects that are depicted in the art because of that focus on ancient Greece and Rome during the Italian Renaissance. We see a lot of figures of mythology that are portrayed in those artworks, and we also see religious figures and scenes. So that's certainly a really big focus during the Italian Renaissance.

And as we shift into the North, we start to see other things that are depicted in art. We see peasants in their everyday life doing their everyday things, and those are really deemed important, whereas we don't really see that in the Italian Renaissance. We see portraits and nature scenes, the interiors of people's homes—domestic interiors. And because of maybe the religious emphasis, we see fewer nudes in the North.

And the actual materials that are used for art also shift between the Italian and Northern Renaissance. So in the Italian Renaissance, we see a lot of frescoes. We see marble being used as a medium for sculptures because Italy is so plentiful with it.

And as we move into the North, that changes as well. We see a lot of oil paints, which is very important for the North, as well as wood being a medium that's going to be used. We get woodcuts out of the Northern Renaissance.

There's a big focus in Italy on scientific proportion, and we really shift that focus to sort of color and detail when we move North.

Both of these art movements have things in common as well. Both of them do have religious subject matter. They're really important for both. We also see that they're both going to use the new linear perspective that comes out of the Italian Renaissance that's going to be shared between them.

And it's definitely—if you're looking for more specific works of art, you can check out the AP Daily videos that are on the slide there. They both also use naturalism, and there are definitely some similarities.

So this is also kind of the first time in our course that we've talked about the skill of the historical reasoning process of comparison. So looking at a chart like that is a really good way to think about what your details might be and your evidence if you're comparing and contrasting two different things.

And the last thing we want to talk about as far as the Renaissance has to do with the idea of Christian humanism. And Christian humanism is embodied in the writings of many of these Christian humanists, but particularly Erasmus, who we'll talk about in a minute.

And these are thinkers that are really taking the ideas of the Renaissance and they're using this to reform religiously. And we're going to see how this is going to lead right into what Todd's going to talk about in a moment.

So we have these Northern Renaissance humanists, and let's take a look for a minute at the image that we have here because one of them I'm going to talk about—not right away, but we're going to talk about—Sir Thomas More. And he is an English humanist, and he writes a book, *Utopia*.

And you can see here, this is sort of a map of what this island of Utopia would look like that he's envisioning. And of course, that's become a word that's in our vocabulary now.

So when we're talking about Northern Renaissance humanists, we want to start with Erasmus. Erasmus is our prince of humanists. He's definitely the most famous Northern humanist. He becomes a very famous reformer, and he wants to really find a way to bring the classical ideas—like humanism and civic virtue—and bring them together with Christian ideas from the Bible, things like love and piety.

So he's not only looking back at classical sources the way that the Italian humanists were, he's looking at those along with original ancient Christian sources from church fathers. So he's trying to really marry these two things together.

Erasmus also created a Greek version of the New Testament, and he's very famous for a work that's a satire called *The Praise of Folly*. And in the satire, he's really criticizing both religious and political institutions.

He believed that education was the key for reform. He created a Latin translation of the New Testament. And because of his criticism of the Catholic Church, he's accused of laying the egg that Martin Luther hatched. So his criticism of the Catholic Church—he's certainly not going to be alone in that, and there are going to be other reformers that are going to pick up on his initial ideas. And Todd's going to talk about those in just a minute.

And then back to the image that we started with, Thomas More is an English humanist, and he wrote *Utopia* in 1516. And here he describes his ideal place, right? And that's what that word has come to mean in our language—that he's talking about an island outside of Europe where all children receive an education in the classics, where there's no poverty or discord, and that the government has solved all the problems.

There's religious toleration, and there's no dissent or disagreement. And so of course, that idea of his Utopia has become a word that now we associate with our perfect idea of how things should be.

All right, hi! Okay, thanks, Katie.

So we're going to move from Renaissance into the Age of Reformation, and Katie kind of led us right into that with talking about the humanists.

So in the Age of Reformation, we're going to see reformers such as Martin Luther and John Calvin pick up on the criticism of the Catholic Church. And what they're criticizing are things that people have been talking about, but now we're going to bring kind of learned people to really talk about that and have that kind of discussion in a much more public way.

Reformers Luther, Calvin—they're going to bring into these kind of new interpretations of Christian doctrine and practice.

So we'll begin here. Here's just an image of Pope Julius II, and he's going to hold the office of pope. One of the things you need to understand about this part of the course is the church is this major authority. They are not only religious authority, but they're kind of secular authority throughout much of Europe. They have kind of a real great political power, and that kind of pervasive avenues all over people's lives.

And in much of it is in a very good way, but now we're going to see how some of that is being criticized by these new reformers.

So we have Pope Julius II—born Giuliano della Rovere—this would be Italian name. And he holds the office of pope from 1503 until his death in 1513. And this is supposedly this image of him about 1510 and engraving.

So in the early 16th century, the Catholic Church is the center of life for all social classes, as I mentioned. Most people are very deeply pious. Katie kind of led us in talked about this shift from Middle Ages into Renaissance. And so much of the thinking is this Middle Age-type thinking where much of today is spent about thinking about our afterlife and how I prepare myself for the afterlife.

There's also why people are also having a wide range of grievances with the church at this time. Educated lay people such as the humanist that Katie talked about, urban residents, villagers, artisans, some church officials themselves look within the church and say, "We need to make some things better."

What are some of the signs of disorder that they're pointing to and abuse in the church? So one is clerical immorality. As you think about clerics and your local clerics in the community, you see them. People see them as kind of a model of behavior. These are the people we look up to, how we try to emulate ourselves. And if they're behaving immorally, then we start to question, "Why do they get to behave that way, and then they tell us to behave a different way?"

The next thing is going to be this idea of absenteeism and pluralism, as well as clerical ignorance. So there's a little cause and effect here with number two, clerical ignorance, because we've just emerged—in fact, some of this is still going on—as the Black Death and the plague from the late Middle Ages.

And the people who would administer to the sick are clerics, priests and nuns. And as the plague resides, we have fewer and fewer priests and nuns in these local parishes. And to kind of respond to that, the Catholic Church is kind of ushering through a very quick, if you will, tutorial about how to be a cleric.

And because of that, they don't know Latin. And when they get up in front of the people and they try to speak the Mass in Latin and they don't know it, it just doesn't land very well. And so there's that.

There's also absenteeism and pluralism. Absenteeism is what that word is—we're not, they're not present; they don't show up. And then pluralism is that because there's this lack—because there are just not enough clerics—some are supposed to be in charge of dioceses in different towns, and that doesn't sit well either.

And then finally, there are privileges because as clerics, as part of the church, they don't have to pay taxes. They don't have to do a number of things that everyday people have to do. And so there's a little resentment that's built up around that as well.

Okay, so we're going to shift really quick. It kind of gives you some context about what's going on. And now we're going to talk about some of these main characters.

And you're looking at this image—it's an illustration of the Dominican preacher Johann Tetzel selling indulgences. That's the thing inside a church. And so we have this really kind of nice image selling them. You see coins on the table there and a priest collecting them, and then it's kind of a piece of paper or a note. And then you see people lined up; they're all ready to go.

And what the indulgence is is it's a forgiveness of sins. And you can also get a forgiveness of your own sins, but you can get a forgiveness of sins for others in your family who may have already passed. And there's this idea that they may be stuck in purgatory, and they may not be on their way up to heaven, and here's a way to spring them into heaven.

And so it's a money-making machine, if you will. It's a branding—it's a way that the Catholic Church is raising revenue at a time when sometimes people don't really have the money to do this.

So here we start with Martin Luther. He's an Augustinian monk, a German monk of the Augustinian order. And through his study in the New Testament, he comes to believe that salvation is obtained by faith alone. So this is a very different way of thinking than has been taught in the Catholic Church. And he kind of goes through a personal journey to get at this.

He believed the scriptures revealed God to people, not the traditions and all the superstitions of the Catholic Church. And so he's going to break with some of the church teachings. And I just got done telling you that the church is this big authority, and so this is going to cause a rift, and it's going to get noticed.

During his time, Pope Leo the 10th is authorizing a special indulgence, as we mentioned, to finance the building of Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome—the world's largest Christian cathedral, the basilica in Rome. And because of that, it takes a lot of money.

In the German states, then, these sales are run by Tetzel, who promises that the purchase of the indulgence will bring full forgiveness of one's sins or the sins of a loved one from purgatory. And he's even got a branding slogan: "When the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory springs." And so it is like a 14th-, 15th-century branding marketing thing that the church has going on.

And German money then in this instance is funneling out of Germany going into Rome, and their resentment grows.

This image here of Luther nailing the 95 Theses—it's kind of cartoonish, and I kind of chuckle a bit because you see the most often—it was just a kind of a place where people posted things on the church door, you know, bulletins so people could read them.

And here he is like, "I'm going to put this up here," and these people onlookers are like, "Oh my gosh, he's really going to do it." I don't think it probably played out that way, but they're taking a little bit of levity and making us laugh a little bit from this artwork.

So we're here for the protesting this type of reform. So Luther is deeply troubled by the indulgences, and as he starts to think about it, he comes up with other grievances. And these are the 95 Theses.

In response, he nails it to the church door in Wittenberg on October 31st—All Hallows Eve—because on All Hallows Eve, the next day is Saints' Day, and he knows people will come to the church; they will see this. And because of the printing press, he can now quickly print these things in Latin and in the German vernacular so they're widely disseminated, and the ideas spread very quickly.

Luther continues to write, urging reform in the church. He wants things changed. His works are going to be condemned by Rome, and he is threatened with excommunication. This is a huge deal—to be excommunicated from the church is like to be pushed out of a community, to be shunned.

And so in 1521, the Holy Roman Emperor at the time is Charles V, and he's going to call what is called a diet—or a meeting, an assembly of notable nobility and clergy in the city of Worms in Germany. And he calls Luther to appear.

Luther shows up. They say, "Did you write this? Did you do this?" He says, "Yes, I did." They expect him to recant or to take back what he's written and what he's said, and he refuses, even though he's threatened with excommunication.

So this event is called the Diet of Worms, and it's this religious division in the German states. Charles V, who is a Habsburg, agrees later on to the Peace of Augsburg in 1555. That's a must-know date for you in history. You have to have some of these anchor dates when you know Peace of Augsburg—1555—then you can think what happened before and what happened after. It's really, really important.

What this does though is it stipulates that Protestantism—this protesting form of religion—is now going to be allowed, and the German princes of the area can choose whether they will be Catholic lands or what is now being called Lutheran lands.

And the people who live in those lands will also need to convert if to that land—to the religion chosen by that particular prince.

So what does that look like on a map? And I really wish I could just blow this up and make it bigger, but you can kind of see that this pinkish color—this orange—is mostly Lutheran. So you see the Scandinavian countries—Norway, Sweden, Finland. You see Brandenburg—that's a part of Prussia.

And you can see how it's spreading—the Netherlands as well. And then it's kind of going down into lower Germany, parts of Austria. But you also see these pieces that are kind of yellowish are areas of wavering adherence, and that is that they're going to remain Catholic.

And so Austria, which is the seat of the Habsburg in Innsbruck, they're very Catholic and remain Catholic as well. And so you start to see this breaking up of what was once totally Catholic-controlled.

So the first area inside of Germany to officially accept the Reformation are the kingdoms of Denmark and Norway under King Christian III. It will be state-sponsored; it is Lutheranism.

While that process of conversion went smoothly and quickly in Denmark, it happens more gradually in northern Norway and over in Iceland due to resistance, but it does occur.

In Sweden, Gustavus Vasa helped bring Protestantism to the region. And then we start to see other reformers popping up.

So proceeding from this idea of God's absolute sovereignty and God's omnipotence, John Calvin—who's Swiss—will conclude that human beings can do nothing to save themselves. Where Luther says, "Your salvation comes through faith alone," John Calvin says, "Actually, I don't think you can do anything. I think God is already pre-decided. God has determined at the beginning of time who will be saved and who will not be saved."

And this idea is known as predestination. It's associated with John Calvin and what we call Calvinism.

Calvin then is going to set up his own city government in Geneva, Switzerland, and he's going to attempt in Geneva to regulate people's conduct in order to create a godly city on earth. So if it's not in the Bible, it cannot be done.

Card playing, dancing, other forms of recreational activity are banned in Calvin's Geneva. One of his students will be a man named John Knox—a minister who studies in Geneva with Calvin. He's instrumental in getting the Scottish Parliament to set up a Calvinist church there—the official state church of Scotland, Presbyterianism.

And so you see on the map this kind of purple color in Scotland, whereas you see this Anglican color in England, setting up other other tensions and wars and battles that will come later.

Okay, all right. And I was really glad to hear you mention that idea of anchor dates. You know, I don't like AP Euro to be about students having to memorize a lot of dates, but I think it's really important that they do know some of these important dates and that they have a sense of chronology in the class.

So I'm glad that you mentioned that because it's something that I'm always doing with my students. And especially as the exam is right around the corner, we want to make sure that you have some of these like sort of buzz dates that you know.

And we want to make sure you have a sense of chronology of how things happen because you're going to possibly have to show that on different parts of the exam. And the one that we're going to talk about today—we're going to talk about the SAQs or the short answer questions.

So you're going to answer three questions. You have 40 minutes to answer those three questions, and it's 20 percent of the score. And we will in a later session go over more details about the format of the test.

But this is what you need to know. And as you are answering these questions, you're really analyzing historians' interpretations. You're looking at historical sources, and you're looking at propositions about history.

So these are things that you need to do. You're going to have questions that provide opportunities for you to demonstrate what you know best. And so I'm sure that many of you have practiced these in your own classes.

The SAQs can include texts. They can include images. There can be a graph with statistics. There can be a map. And then finally, you're going to choose between two options for the final required SAQ, and that will focus on a different time period that you get to choose.

So as we're looking at the SAQs generally—and Todd, if you'll move on—no, thank you. You're there.

There's three questions that you're going to answer out of four. So SAQ 1 is a required question. Every student taking the AP exam has to answer it, and that will include one or possibly two secondary source interpretations.

These are usually interpretations of a historian about an important historical event, and they focus on developments or processes between the year 1600 and 2001. So that's your time frame for SAQ 1.

SAQ 2 is also required. Every student needs to write that answer, and that will be a primary source. It will also be between 1600 and 2001. It can very likely be an image, but it could also be a text. It could be a chart. It could be a map from the time period.

So that'll be a primary source for SAQ 2. And then for SAQ 3, you get to choose between two questions, and you choose the one that you feel that you can do a better and stronger answer for.

The first one will be covering the time period 1450 to 1648, and the second one will cover 1648 to 1815—so anywhere in that the first two time periods of AP Euro.

And then SAQ number four will cover the later part of the course, and it can be anywhere from 1815 pretty much through the present of the course.

There will not be a source for SAQ 3 or 4, and we'll show you an example of those in a minute. They'll just be the tasks that you have to do, and there will be no stimulus attached to SAQ 3 or 4. But you do get to choose the one that you like better.

And Todd's going to unpack the SAQ and talk a little bit more about format and skills.

Okay, so when you get to the short answer question—the SAQ—there are these task words that we need to talk about. So straightforward task assessing content and skills.

There are three parts for each SAQ—A, B, and C. Each part counts as one point. So one of the first things we need to do is understand what we're being asked and what is that task verb used for each part.

So it could be to "identify," and that means to indicate or provide information about a specific topic without elaboration or explanation. However, you do need to write in complete sentences. You should not bullet list in phrases. That would not go over well. You need to have full sentences.

"Describe" could be the task word—provide just relevant characteristics of a specific topic. Just tell us what happened.

Or "explain." Explain is a little higher bar. So you need to provide information about how or why a relationship, process, pattern, position, situation, or outcome occurs, using evidence and/or reasoning. So in other words, tell us what happened and the how, why, or because of what happened.

When you respond to the short answer question in the exam, you want to label each response—your A, your B, and your C. So use the stem of the prompt to respond to the prompt.

So when responding to "explain" prompts, be sure you include that "how," "why," or "because." And just use that language. You've said something; you've said, "This has occurred." Make sure you're adding on to it: "This occurred because," or "This is why this is happening at this time."

So an example task that you might see:

A is to explain how the historical situation in England led to political change in the 1500s. So again, the content is, "Oh my gosh, I have to know England 1500s to even have a broad idea of what kind of political change they're talking about."

Here's a sample response about just the stem of how you want to respond, and this is again using the stem of the prompt to respond to the problem.

Get yourself into that writing: "The historical situation in England led to political change in the 1500s because," or "due to," and then you're going to put in your response and your thinking. And examples would be really helpful too.

We also encourage you to use something we call a T-E-A structure. T being for topic sentence, E being for the evidence and example, and A for analysis.

So when you think about, "I'm going to make a paragraph response," and it needs to have this kind of structure—topic sentence, evidence, example—some teachers may have taught you to use like CRE, which means claim, reasoning, example. Then that's a great idea too.

So whatever structure your teachers taught you, please use that. This is the one that Katie and I use in our classes, and so that's why we're offering it here. So it's a best practice that'll work for both the short answer question and for your essay responses that we're going to cover later in these reviews.

And Katie's going to start and walk you through, I think, as a secondary source SAQ.

Okay, so what you're seeing on the screen is like a short segment from a historian's look at the events of the French Revolution. Let's just read it together really quickly.

It says, "The revolutionary period of England may be said to have lasted nearly 50 years if we reckon from the beginning of the civil wars under Charles the First to the assassination of William III in 1688. These the efforts of these 50 years had no other real and permanent object than the establishment of the current constitution, which is the finest monument of justice and moral greatness existing in Europe.

"The same movement in the minds of men that brought about the revolution in England was the cause of that of France in 1789." Again, there's some other anchor dates just to point that out.

"Both belong to a new era in the progress of social order—the establishment of representative government, a point towards which humanity is directing itself."

So as you're looking at understanding what the author is saying in this paragraph, the student would want to have a look at this paragraph, read through it, understand what the author's argument is so that then you can look at the tasks that you need to answer that are related to this.

So the first task is A—describe. And it says, "Describe one argument the author makes regarding the revolutions discussed in the passage."

So you had to have the historical skill of interpretation—being able to read and understand the argument that the author is making.

And then you move on to B, and B asks you to "identify one piece of evidence not found in the source that would support the author's claim regarding representative government."

So you are looking at what do you know about the time period that could actually support what the author of the passage is saying. So what historical knowledge do you have?

So you're going to be trying to identify that historical knowledge. And then C asks you to dig a little deeper and think about what historical knowledge can you explain that is a limitation of the author's view about the French Revolution.

So what do you know about the topic that you can dig into and explain—not just identifying but also really getting into a deeper look at how or why that you know as a student that you've learned about the French Revolution that kind of undermines the argument that the author is making.

So these are three pretty distinct tasks, and you really want to take a moment and read the passage and take a moment and really think about what that argument is and what you know about the time periods that the author is referring to.

Thanks, Katie.

SAQ 2 is going to be a primary source, and in this instance, they've given us an image. So when they give us an image, they're also going to give you a source line.

So I was telling my students, "Read the source line first. Get yourself in that mindset." And so this is this French artist and has Colbert presenting the members of the Royal Academy of Science to Louis XIV, 1667.

So if you've done your reading, you know who Colbert is. You know who Louis XIV is And if you're probably like my students, you're like, "Gosh, that was a while ago." That's part of the review—it's why you review. It's why you're watching our videos. Go back, make sure you're paying attention to who Colbert is and Louis XIV.

And then we can take a look at the image. We see it's at Versailles, and then we start thinking, "Oh, this must be Louis, right? He's the king sitting down. He's holding this staff representing that he's the one in charge." We have people presenting—it's the Royal Academy of Science, so we see all these globes and maps and things being hung up here.

So this gives us the image, and now we're going to look at our tasks.

The A task is to ​​describe one way in which the image depicts the significant feature of the Scientific Revolution​​. To respond to this question, then I have to know what the Scientific Revolution was about—what were the principal characteristics of the Scientific Revolution—and how can I connect them to what's going on in the image.

The B task is to ​​describe King Louis XIV's likely purpose in commissioning the painting​​. So the artist has been commissioned or paid by the main subject here, which is Louis, and why would Louis be doing something like that? That's what we're asking—describe why.

And then our C task is to ​​explain​​—so you can see the "describe, describe," and now we're working on "explain," which means we have to do the "how," "why," or "because."

​​Explain one way in which development shown in the image changed or continued during the Enlightenment.​​ So we know the Scientific Revolution leads to this period of Enlightenment, and now we have a question that's directly asking about change or continuity of these developments over time.

So really nice put-together SAQ there that is assessing a number of things that the students need to know.

I really like that image.

As I said before, those will be the first two SAQs that you have to do. And then we move on to SAQ 3 and 4, which are just straightforward tasks, but they don't refer to either a historian's interpretation or to a primary source, as SAQ 2 is going to refer to.

And SAQ 3 will just have these sort of straightforward tasks without a stimulus. So an example of one from the most recent AP exam is the one that you're seeing on the screen.

And this is they're asked to:

​​A) Describe one specific example of a change in the role of religion in European daily life during the period 1450 to 1700.​​

Right, so we're looking here at the reasoning process of change.

The B task kind of takes the other side of that and asks them to:

​​B) Describe one specific example of continuity in the role of religion.​​

So this is one of the reasoning processes I'm sure you've already practiced in class—that things are changing, but some things also stay the same.

So we've already talked in our content piece about some pretty significant changes in religion, but then what doesn't change about religion in the B task?

And then the C is that deeper explanation, and they'd like:

​​C) Using a specific example from 1450 to 1700, explain how political authorities attempted to control religious beliefs or practices.​​

So this is—my students really liked this SAQ. It's very straightforward. It's really testing your knowledge, and you have a moment to showcase what you know. But again, remember that C is talking about more than just sort of naming or identifying a political authority that is trying to control but rather to explain how that political authority tried to control or even why. And going a little deeper—explanation requires more.

So you will also—this is the one where you get choice, as Katie mentioned. There's no stimulus or source to look at. These are just straightforward questions, but you can choose: "Do I want these earlier questions or a set of later questions?"

So here are the later set, and the A task is to:

​​A) Describe one specific example of change in the role of the state in European daily life from the period 1900 to 1945.​​

And so you see there's a lot of parallel between describing one specific example of change—describe one specific example of change—but we're changing what is different in the content, and this is later content.

So the B task then is going to be to:

​​B) Describe one specific example of change in the role of the state in daily life in Western Europe in the period 1945–2000.​​

Now, I would need you to notice they talked about Western Europe here, so you want to make sure that you're looking at every word and making sure that you're answering the question.

And then the C task is:

​​C) Using a specific example from the period 1945 to 2000, explain how Eastern European states attempted to limit individual rights.​​

So we have that "explain" task in the C task here, just as we do in the C prompt above, but now we've focused the region on Eastern European states. So make sure you're paying attention to each little part of the question.

But you have choice here: "Do I want to do the early one or the late one?" And then you sit and write your A, B, and C tasks.

Absolutely. And Todd, if you don't mind, I also want to emphasize something that I think is so important, and that is for every question on the exam, students really taking a moment to make sure that they're doing a good job reading the question.

I know that exam is right around the corner, and there's a lot of adrenaline associated with that. And so there's sometimes this tendency to go really quickly. And if you do that and you miss important words like "Western" or "Eastern," then you're going to be providing evidence that doesn't actually qualify as evidence if it's not adhering to the actual question as it's asked.

So it's really, really important on the AP exam that you read the prompts carefully and that you really think about what the prompts are asking because I know that there's this tendency to go fast.

Okay, so we want to give you practice. I know that exam is right around the corner, so if you're watching this on your computer or your laptop, you can grab your phone and scan the code, or you're welcome to type out the tiny URL that you see on the screen because we have a Google Drive, and that Google Drive has multiple pieces of practice in it.

And today, the practice is going to be short answer questions for you to practice. And then on our next session, what we're going to do is really model the answers, and Todd, you're going to go over kind of again the week and where we're going from here.

Yep, so one more time—there you can pause the video obviously, but there you go for the QR code or the URL.

And then here's our learning for this first week of AP Live. And so today was Session 1—we did the content review of Renaissance, Reformation. We talked—broke down the SAQ today.

Your homework, as Katie just pointed out, is writing the SAQ. Tomorrow—or excuse me, the next session—I should say Session 2 is about absolutism, constitutionalism, and then we'll look at some samples of the SAQ that was assigned as homework. So we'll look at—we'll unpack it. We'll tell you why it earned points or did not earn points.

And then your skill development is we're going to start looking at essay responses. We're going to take it a piece at a time—how do you construct contextualization and thesis for the LEQ and DBQ?

And so the homework will be just writing context and thesis—those context/thesis paragraphs.

What's a good strategy to get us into that? We're going to be with you to do these eight sessions of review. We're going to get you guys so ready. We're excited because we know that you're going to just do a super job on all this.

Absolutely.

All right, Katie, thank you so much.

Yeah, thank you too. Hey, do you know what in Italy they call a fake noodle?

I don't know, Todd. What in Italy?

It's an impasta! Katie, impasta—everyone knows this! Impasta!

Should we warn everybody that they're in for eight sessions of really bad dad jokes? Should we?

Who says they're bad?

Who says they're bad?

Take care. We look forward to seeing you guys soon. Take care. Thanks, everybody. Bye-bye!
