you both for dinner. I mean...I would like to

- "To have you both for dinner" 直译是“*把你们俩当晚餐*”，这听起来像是字面上的意思，暗示把人当作食物，通常在这种情况下是一个幽默的错误或不合适的说法。这个表达可能会引起误解，给人一种威胁或幽默的感觉。

- "To have you both *over* for dinner" 是一种常见的邀请说法，意思是“*请你们俩来我家吃晚餐*”。这里的**“over”表示邀请别人到自己家中聚餐。**

所以，第二个表达是正确的且常用的，第一种则因为没有 "over" 可能会引起误解。

== ★ the Miranda Rights 米兰达权利

Anyone who has watched a cop drama 戏；剧 on television has probably heard of Miranda rights, which serve to protect criminal suspects’ 嫌疑犯 constitutional 宪法的；宪法规定的 rights. When law enforcement 执法部门 takes a suspect into custody 监禁，拘留, they are required to inform (v.)通知，告知 the suspect of their Miranda warnings before an interrogation 审问，盘问 can take place. Here is what you need to know about Miranda rights and how they work.

[.my2]
看过电视警匪剧的人可能都听说过米兰达权，它旨在保护犯罪嫌疑人的宪法权利。当执法部门拘留嫌疑人时，他们必须在审讯之前告知嫌疑人米兰达警告。以下是您需要了解的有关米兰达权利及其运作方式的信息。

Who is Ernesto Miranda?

[.my2]
埃内斯托·米兰达是谁？

Miranda rights are named after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case Miranda v. Arizona (1966). Ernesto Miranda was arrested for stealing $8 from an Arizona bank worker. After two hours of questioning, Miranda confessed (v.)坦白；承认 *not only* to the robbery 盗窃，抢劫 *but also* to kidnapping 绑架；诱拐 and rape. When he was brought in for questioning, he was never told that he did not have to speak to _law enforcement_ 执法部门 officers or that he could consult (v.)咨询，请教 with a lawyer. He simply confessed (v.)坦白；承认 to the crimes and was found guilty.

[.my2]
米兰达权利以具有里程碑意义的美国最高法院案例米兰达诉亚利桑那州（1966）命名。埃内斯托·米兰达 (Ernesto Miranda) 因从亚利桑那州银行工作人员偷窃 8 美元而被捕。经过两个小时的审问，米兰达不仅承认了抢劫的事实，还承认了绑架和强奸的事实。当他被带去接受讯问时，他从未被告知他不必与执法人员交谈，也没有被告知他可以咨询律师。他只是承认了罪行并被判有罪。

Miranda's conviction 定罪，判罪 was appealed 上诉；申诉 to the United States Supreme Court. The justices 法官 ruled that the statements 后定 _Miranda made to the police_ could not be used as evidence against him because he had not been advised 通知，告知 of his Constitutional rights. Since this decision, law enforcement officials are required to recite (v.)背诵，朗诵；详述，列举 the Miranda warning to suspects before any questioning 盘问，询问 is conducted 组织；安排；实施；执行.

[.my2]
米兰达的定罪被上诉到美国最高法院。法官裁定米兰达向警方所作的陈述不能用作对他不利的证据，因为他没有被告知他的宪法权利。自这一决定以来，执法人员必须在进行任何讯问之前向嫌疑人背诵米兰达警告。

The Miranda case did not establish new rights but rather instituted 创立；设置 further protection of Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.

[.my2]
米兰达案并未确立新的权利，而是对第五和第六修正案权利进行了进一步保护。

Miranda rights protect the Fifth Amendment, which safeguards (v.)保护；为……提供防护措施 individuals from self-incrimination 自认犯罪；自我牵累 in criminal cases, and the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees (v.)保证；担保；保障 criminal suspects the right to a lawyer.

[.my2]
米兰达权利保护第五修正案，保障个人在刑事案件中免于自证其罪，以及第六修正案，保障犯罪嫌疑人聘请律师的权利。

The components of the Miranda Warning

[.my2]
米兰达警告的组成部分

The following is the standard Miranda warning: "You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to speak to an attorney and to have an attorney present during any questioning. If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be provided for you at government expense."

[.my2]
以下是标准的米兰达警告：“你有权保持沉默。你所说的任何话都可能并且将会在法庭上被用来对你不利。你有权与律师交谈并在任何情况下都有权让律师在场。如果你请不起律师，政府会出钱为你提供一名律师。”

Each state makes its own rules about exactly what must be told to suspects who have been arrested or are being held for interrogation (n.)审问，盘问 by police, but the Supreme Court’s decision requires these four points to be clearly communicated 传达，传递（想法、感情、思想等）.

[.my2]
每个州都制定了自己的规则，规定必须向已被逮捕或被警察拘留审讯的嫌疑人具体告知什么内容，但最高法院的裁决要求明确传达这四点。

1.You have the right to remain silent

[.my2]
1.你有权保持沉默

Silence cannot be used against defendants 被告 in court. However, there is a term *known as* _“pre-Miranda” silence_, which occurs when _a criminal suspect_ has not been read his or her Miranda rights and still remains silent. In that case, silence can be seen as unusual and suspect. Suspects who state something like, “My attorney has always told me not to give statements without him present,” may avoid the negative consequences of refusing to speak.

沉默不能在法庭上被用来对抗被告。然而，有一种被称为“米兰达权利告知前沉默”的情况，这是指犯罪嫌疑人在未被告知其米兰达权利时保持沉默。在这种情况下，沉默可能被视为不寻常且可疑。如果嫌疑人说出类似“我的律师一直告诉我，没有他在场不要发表任何声明”的话，可能会避免因拒绝说话而产生的负面后果。


The right to remain silent has long been recognized （正式）认可，接受，赞成 by the Supreme Court as requiring a high degree of protection. Since Miranda v. Arizona was decided in 1966, procedural  程序上的 safeguards have been put in place to inform 通知，告知 individuals of this right upon(=on) arrest.

Yet, a _gray area_ exists when it comes to the use of an individual's silence post-arrest 逮捕后的. It may *surprise* (v.) some *that* _a point in time_ 时间点 exists (v.) when an individual has not yet been read their Miranda rights post-arrest. Several _circuit （绕……）环行 courts_ 巡回法院 have taken the position that any silence that follows (v.)跟随；在……后发生 arrest but precedes (v.)在……之先；优于 the reading of Miranda rights can be used against an individual as evidence of their guilt.

`主` The unresolved circuit (n.)（法官的）巡回审判 split (v.)分裂，使分裂（成不同的派别） on the issue of post-arrest pre-Miranda silence `谓` continues *to pose a threat to* 对…构成威胁 one of the most fundamental rights 基本权利 afforded to individuals.

Resolution is not *out of* the Court's *reach* 波及范围；影响范围. By incorporating (v.)将…包括在内；包含；吸收；使并入 _existing (a.) precedent_ 先例，前例 and establishing (v.) _a bright-line (a.)（尤指法律上）有明确标准的，有明确方针的 rule_ which would require (v.) formal arrest 正式逮捕 to immediately trigger (v.) Miranda's procedural safeguards 程序保障, the Court can ensure that `主` _the constitutional guarantees_  which are so deeply rooted in our justice system `谓` may continue to prosper (v.)繁荣，成功.

[.my2]
最高法院长期以来一直认为保持沉默的权利需要高度保护。自 1966 年米兰达诉亚利桑那州案判决以来，已经制定了程序保障措施，在个人被捕时告知其这项权利。 +
然而，在利用个人被捕后的沉默方面, 存在灰色地带。一些人可能会感到惊讶，在某个时间点上，一个人在被捕后尚未被宣读其米兰达权利。一些巡回法院采取的立场是，逮捕后但在宣读米兰达权利之前的任何沉默都可以用来针对个人作为其有罪的证据。在逮捕后米兰达之前的沉默问题上悬而未决的巡回法院的分歧, 继续对个人最基本的权利之一构成威胁。解决方案并非超出法院的能力范围。通过纳入现有先例, 并建立明确的规则，要求正式逮捕才能立即触发米兰达的程序保障，法院可以确保深深植根于我们司法系统的宪法保障能够继续繁荣。


2.Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law

[.my2]
2.你所说的任何话都可能在法庭上对你不利

All suspects have the right to remain silent. Those who give up that right face (v.) the prospect that their statements will be used against them in court. This can be tricky 难对付的，棘手的, as many times the only evidence against a defendant 被告，被告人 is a confession 供认，供状；承认，坦白. Defense lawyers contend （尤指在争论中）声称，主张，认为 that many innocent suspects, intimidated (v.)威胁，恐吓 by arrest and interrogation 审问，盘问, may speak to police without realizing (v.)理解；领会；认识到；意识到 the danger.

[.my2]
所有嫌疑人都有权保持沉默。那些放弃这一权利的人, 将面临"他们的陈述"将在法庭上被用来对付他们的前景。这会很棘手，因为很多时候，对被告不利的唯一证据就是"他们之前的认罪"。辩护律师认为，许多无辜的嫌疑人, 受到"被逮捕和审讯"的恐吓下，可能会在没有意识到"他们这样做会给自己带来危险"的情况下, 就向警方交谈。

3.You have the right to have an attorney present

[.my2]
3.您有权请律师在场

This gives a suspect the right to have _legal counsel_ (辩护律师) 法律顾问 present at the time of the interrogation  审问，盘问. A suspect must *be clearly informed* that he or she has the right to consult 咨询，请教；商量，商讨 with an attorney and have an attorney present before answering any questions from police. If the police try to question a suspect after an arrest, they must stop the interrogation if the suspect requests an attorney.

[.my2]
这赋予嫌疑人在审讯时有律师在场的权利。必须明确告知嫌疑人，他或她有权咨询律师并在回答警方的任何问题之前有律师在场。如果警方在逮捕嫌疑人后试图讯问嫌疑人，并且嫌疑人请求律师，他们必须停止讯问。

4.If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you

[.my2]
4.如果您无力聘请律师，我们将为您指定一名律师

In order *to make sure* a person being interrogated has a clear understanding of his or her rights, the suspect must be told that a lawyer will be appointed without charge if needed. Without this additional advisory 官方警告；警报, `主` the caution 提醒，告诫 of _the right to consult (v.) with an attorney_ `谓` could be misunderstood (v.)误解，误会 and rendered (v.)使成为，使处于某种状态 meaningless.

[.my2]
为了确保受审者清楚了解自己的权利，必须告知嫌疑人，如果需要，将免费指定律师。如果没有这个额外的建议，"咨询律师的权利"的警告, 可能会被误解, 并变得毫无意义。

When are Miranda rights required?

[.my2]
什么时候需要米兰达权利？

Miranda rights must be read before custodial (a.)监禁的；拘留的 police interrogation.

[.my2]
在拘留警察审讯之前必须阅读米兰达的权利。

In the context 背景，环境；上下文 of Miranda rights, `主` whether someone is considered to be in custody 监禁，拘留 `谓` *depends on* whether a reasonable individual in the suspect’s position would feel that they could exercise 运用，行使 their right against self-incrimination and the level of restriction （受）限制（状态），（受）约束（状态） on the suspect’s freedom.

[.my2]
在米兰达权利的背景下，某人是否被视为被拘留, 取决于一个合理的个人在嫌疑人的立场上是否会认为他们可以行使其"反对自证其罪"的权利, 以及对嫌疑人自由的限制程度。

For example, a person who is arrested and taken to jail can be considered to be in police custody.
例如，一个人被逮捕并入狱可以被视为被警方拘留。

Interrogation is when police question a suspect as part of a criminal investigation. Custodial interrogation is when a suspect is questioned while they are in police custody, but interrogation can also happen outside of custody.
审讯是指警察在刑事调查中询问嫌疑人。拘留审讯是指嫌疑人在警方拘留期间接受讯问，但审讯也可以在拘留之外进行。

For instance, if a suspect is arrested by a police officer and then questioned at the local police station, that could be considered custodial interrogation, and the police would be required to read the suspect the Miranda warnings before questioning. If the police question a suspect who isn’t in custody, that is called non-custodial interrogation.
例如，如果嫌疑人被警察逮捕，然后在当地警察局接受讯问，这可能被视为拘留审讯，警察在讯问之前需要阅读嫌疑人的米兰达警告。如果警方讯问未被拘留的嫌疑人，则称为非拘留审讯。

When are Miranda rights not required?
什么时候不需要米兰达权利？
The Miranda decision is intended to make suspects aware of their constitutional rights. Police can ask routine questions—such as name, address, date of birth, and social security number—without reading Miranda rights.
米兰达案的判决旨在让嫌疑人意识到他们的宪法权利。警察可以询问常规问题，例如姓名、地址、出生日期和社会安全号码，而无需阅读米兰达权利。

Law enforcement does not have to read Miranda rights in certain situations, such as the following:
在某些情况下，执法部门不必阅读米兰达权利，例如以下情况：

When voluntary statements are given outside of interrogation
在审讯之外做出自愿陈述时
When public safety is at risk
当公共安全面临风险时
If the suspect waives their Miranda rights
如果嫌疑人放弃米兰达权利
During ordinary traffic stops
在普通交通停车期间
Keep in mind that if a suspect confesses to a crime before receiving the Miranda warnings, the confession may later be used as evidence in court.
请记住，如果嫌疑人在收到米兰达警告之前承认犯罪，该供述可能会在法庭上用作证据。

Waiving and invoking Miranda rights
放弃和援引米兰达权利
A suspect must state that they are invoking their Miranda rights. It’s not enough to simply remain silent: The suspect should explicitly inform law enforcement that they are invoking their Miranda rights.
嫌疑人必须声明他们正在援引米兰达权利。仅仅保持沉默是不够的：嫌疑人应该明确告知执法部门他们正在援引米兰达权利。

Suspects can invoke their Miranda rights by saying something like, “I want to invoke my right to remain silent, and I need to talk to a lawyer before answering questions.”
嫌疑人可以通过这样说来援引米兰达权利：“我想援引我保持沉默的权利，我需要在回答问题之前与律师交谈。”

If a person is arrested but decides to talk to the police despite the warning, they do have the right to change their mind. They can invoke their Miranda rights at any time during questioning, meaning they can decide to stop answering questions or only talk to police officers with a lawyer present.
如果一个人被捕但不顾警告决定与警方交谈，他们确实有权改变主意。他们可以在审讯期间随时援引米兰达权利，这意味着他们可以决定停止回答问题或仅在有律师在场的情况下与警察交谈。

It’s important to note that even if a suspect invokes their Miranda rights, they can still waive those rights, either implicitly or expressly.
值得注意的是，即使嫌疑人援引米兰达权利，他们仍然可以隐式或明示放弃这些权利。

A suspect can waive their rights implicitly by talking to police after receiving the Miranda warnings, or they can waive their rights expressly by stating that they want to relinquish their rights.
嫌疑人可以在收到米兰达警告后通过与警方交谈来暗示放弃自己的权利，也可以通过声明他们想放弃自己的权利来明确放弃自己的权利。

What are the consequences of not being read my Miranda rights?
不阅读我的米兰达权利会产生什么后果？
If the police do not provide a Miranda warning before an interrogation, any information they obtain from you may be inadmissible in court.
如果警察在审讯前没有提供米兰达警告，他们从您那里获得的任何信息可能在法庭上不被采纳。

However, there are some exceptions, such as when there is a danger to public safety or if you voluntarily provide information before custodial interrogation.
然而，也有一些例外，例如当公共安全面临危险或您在拘留审讯前自愿提供信息时。

FAQs  常见问题
Are there any exceptions to the Miranda rule?
米兰达规则有任何例外吗？
Police can ask basic questions—such as those used to identify a suspect—without giving Miranda warnings. Law enforcement does not have to read Miranda rights if a suspect has waived their Miranda rights, if public safety is threatened, or if a suspect voluntarily provides information outside of a custodial interrogation.
警察可以询问基本问题，例如用于识别嫌疑人的问题，而无需向米兰达发出警告。如果嫌疑人放弃了米兰达权利、公共安全受到威胁或者嫌疑人在拘留审讯之外自愿提供信息，执法部门就不必解读米兰达权利。

Can the police use my statements against me if I don't understand my Miranda rights?
如果我不了解我的米兰达权利，警察可以利用我的陈述来对付我吗？
If you were improperly warned, your statements cannot be used against you at trial. However, the statements may be used for other purposes (such as for impeachment), and information from voluntary confessions may be used in certain circumstances.
如果您受到不当警告，则您的陈述不能在审判中用于对您不利。然而，这些陈述可以用于其他目的（例如弹劾），并且在某些情况下可以使用自愿供述的信息。

What should I do if I believe my Miranda rights were violated?
如果我认为我的米兰达权利受到侵犯，我该怎么办？
If you believe your Miranda rights have been violated, you should contact a criminal defense attorney to ensure that your rights are protected.
如果您认为您的米兰达权利受到侵犯，您应该联系刑事辩护律师，以确保您的权利受到保护。

What happened to Ernesto Miranda?
埃内斯托·米兰达怎么了？
Ernesto Miranda did, indeed, get a new trial based on the Supreme Court ruling, and his original confession was thrown out. However, based on the evidence, Miranda was convicted and served 11 years in prison before being paroled in 1972.
埃内斯托·米兰达确实根据最高法院的裁决进行了新的审判，他原来的供词被驳回了。然而，根据证据，米兰达被定罪并入狱11年，然后于1972年假释。

In 1976, at the age of 34, Miranda was murdered. Police arrested a suspect in the killing who, after choosing to exercise his Miranda right to remain silent, was released without being charged with the crime.
1976年，34岁的米兰达被谋杀。警方逮捕了一名杀人嫌疑人，该嫌疑人在选择行使米兰达保持沉默的权利后被释放，但没有被指控犯罪。
