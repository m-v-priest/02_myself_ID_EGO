== Elementary ‐ Global View ‐ Global Warming (C0102)

image:/img/svg 006.svg[,80%]




A: And therefore 因此，所以, global warming is the
greatest deception 欺骗，蒙骗；骗术，骗局 of the early 21st century.
Questions 有问题吗?

[.my1]
.案例
====
在这里，"Questions?" 是一个简短的提问，意思是“有问题吗？” 或 “有什么问题吗？” 它通常用于演讲或讲座结束时，邀请听众提出问题。
====

B: Uh& yeah. In the lecture 讲座，讲课，演讲 you said there's
more evidence in the scientific record 科学记录
supporting (v.) global cooling 全球变冷?

A: Well, yes, essentially 本质上，根本上, the historical record
supports (v.) a theory of climate cycles 气候变化周期. Warming
and cooling are cooperating 合作；配合 processes in the
planetary 行星的；（与）地球（有关）的 eco-system.

[.my2]
是的，本质上，历史记录支持气候周期的理论。变暖和变冷是行星生态系统中相辅相成的过程。

B: If that's true and the planet is getting
cooler, what explains (v.) the rapid melting （使）融化 of the
polar极地的  ice caps 帽 and the dramatic rise in the
global average  平均水平,平均值 temperatures?

[.my2]
如果这是真的，而且地球正在变冷，那么如何解释极地冰盖的迅速融化, 和全球平均气温的急剧上升呢？


A: But are global temperatures rising? If you
look at the data from nineteen seventy-five
you'll...

B: You'll be misled
(v.)把……带错方向（mislead 的过去式）. If you were serious, you
would look at the record starting in the
1880s. Then you would see how dramatically
the earths temperature has changed.

A: Young lady, *I beg to differ* 恕我不敢苟同. Look, the point
of the lecture （通常指大学里的）讲座，讲课，演讲 was to emphasize that there is
evidence for both sides, and I’m *putting forth* 提出，提议
the argument 论据；理由；论点 that there’s greater evidence
in support of the global cooling hypothesis 假说，假设.
Look, it’s an indisputable 不容置疑的，无可争辩的 fact that the public
is being manipulated 任人摆布,操纵 and scared into
believing there's some kind of climate crisis;
this scaremongering (n.)散布恐怖消息，制造恐慌 is done, quite simply,
for political reasons.

[.my2]
小姑娘，我不同意。看，这场讲座的重点是强调两方都有证据支持，我提出的论点是支持全球变冷假说的证据更多。看，毫无争议的事实是，公众正被操控并被吓唬着相信有什么气候危机；这种制造恐慌的行为，很简单地，是出于政治原因。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.put forward/forth something
to suggest an idea for consideration: +
- None of the ideas that I put forward have been accepted. +
- He put forth a clear, logical argument.
====

B: But even without the uncomfortable
reality that greenhouse gases like carbon
dioxide *contribute to* global warming, isn't the
topic *appropriate (a.)合适的；恰当的 for* politicians to discuss (v.)?

[.my2]
但是，即使没有"温室气体（如二氧化碳）对全球变暖的贡献"的令人不舒服的现实，气候问题难道不应该是政治家们讨论的话题吗？


A: Not if they want to use your tax dollars 税款
and mine to fund (v.) completely unnecessary
initiatives 倡议；新方案.

[.my2]
如果他们想用你的税钱和我的税钱, 来资助完全不必要的举措，那就不是了。


B: Yeah, like conservation 保护，保存；节约，防止浪费, protecting
endangered (a.)（动植物）濒危的 species （动植物的）种，物种；种类 and *investing in*
renewable energy. *At the very least* 至少；起码, you
have to concede （通常指不情愿地）承认 that this debate has the
potential （事物的）潜力，可能性 to  end (v.) our dependence  依赖，依靠  on foreign
oil. `主` *Buying (v.) oil* `谓` supports (v.) _autocratic (a.)独裁的，专制的 countries_
that use (v.) these revenues 收入；税收 to _devastating (a.) ends_ (n.)目的；目标.

[.my2]
是啊，比如保护环境、保护濒危物种和投资可再生能源。至少，你必须承认，这场辩论有可能结束我们对外国石油的依赖。购买石油支持的是专制国家，这些国家用这些收入, 做出毁灭性的行为。

A: Why, I've never been so disrespected (v.)不尊重，轻视 in all
of my days. I’m a professor, a scientist and
researcher of high regard 尊重；尊敬；敬佩.

[.my2]
为什么，我一生中从未如此受到不尊重。我是教授，是一位备受尊敬的科学家和研究员。

B: Yeah, and a duplicitous (a.)奸诈的；双重的；搞两面派的 one at that.
Everyone knows you're *in the pocket 受某人的控制（或极大影响）；在某人掌握之中 of* the
oil lobby 游说团体. Why should we trust (v.) your so-called
findings (n.)发现，调查结果；检验发现的情况 *more than* tobacco institute （教育、专业等）机构，机构建筑 studies (n.)
which say _smoking doesn't harm (v.) health_?
You're full of it 充满谎言.

[.my2]
是的，你还是一个虚伪的。大家都知道你是石油游说团体的走狗。为什么我们要相信你所谓的研究结果，胜过那些烟草研究所说的"吸烟对健康无害"的研究？你简直是在胡说八道。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.someone is full of it
someone is wrong or not telling the truth.
====

A: Some people just cannot handle (v.) 处理，应付（局势、人、工作或感情） civil 公民的，国民的;有礼貌的；客气的;民事的（非刑事的） debate!

[.my2]
有些人根本无法进行理性的辩论！

here in Aspen, Colorado where the sun is
shinning, and we’ve got twelve inches of
fresh powder 细雪，粉状雪. It doesn’t get much better
than this 没有比这更好的了.

on
the slopes. We don’t want you hitting any of
those moguls 雪丘，雪墩，“猫跳”（滑雪坡道上需跳越的硬雪堆）;大亨；有权势的人;莫卧儿人!

[.my2]
首先，把靴子穿好。你要确保靴子贴合脚部，对了，现在把它们扣进绑定器里。还有，你也需要一副好的护目镜来保护眼睛。今天阳光很强烈，雪坡上的反光会很刺眼。我们可不希望你撞上那些雪丘！

[.my1]
.案例
====
.You're going to want to (do / have) something
This expression is used to talk about something that a person doesn't want now, but you think they will want it in the future, when the situation is different. This is often used when someone is planning ahead for something, like a trip, and you're trying to think of what they will need in the future.

这个表达方式用来谈论一个人现在不想要的东西，但你认为他们将来在情况不同时, 会想要它。当某人提前计划某件事（例如旅行），而您试图考虑他们将来需要什么时，通常会使用此方法。

In normal conversation, "going to" would be pronounced "gonna". +

A: Bob, since you’re a beginner (n.)初学者；新手 skier and
might take a few spills （尤指从自行车或船上）摔下，跌落;（使）洒出，泼出，溢出, it is a good idea to
have a good warm pair of dry ski gloves.

鲍勃，既然你是滑雪初学者，可能会摔几次，建议准备一副暖和、干燥的滑雪手套。

C: Easy there, Rick! Well, let’s head (v.)朝（某方向）行进 on over
to the chairlift （统称）登山吊椅, and test your skills! All right,
we’re up here on the bunny 兔子 hill, so, Bob, why

run, Rick! Nice carving 雕刻! You’ve got some mad

[.my1]
.案例
====
.chairlift
image:/img/chairlift.jpg[,15%]

.That was sick
在这里，"sick" 是俚语，表示 "非常棒"、"酷毙了" 或 "令人惊叹" 的意思。这种用法是积极的，与其字面意义（生病）完全不同。 +
因此，"That was sick" 可以理解为：
“那真是太棒了！” 或 “绝了！”
====

A: You wanna see gnarly (a.)呱呱叫的；极好的? Well, see that
bump over there, I’m going to catch some
major air.

[.my2]
你想看更厉害的？看那边的凸起，我要飞起来抓点大空气！

[.my1]
.案例
====
.You wanna see gnarly
在俚语中，"gnarly" 通常表示 "很棒的" 或 "非常刺激的"，尤其是在极限运动（比如滑雪、冲浪或滑板）中，**形容一个特别难但很酷的动作或体验。**同时，它也可以表示某些事情很极端或棘手，但在这里的语境中，它是积极的，表示 "特别酷"。

所以这句话 "You wanna see gnarly?" 的意思是：
“你想看看更酷的吗？”

.I’m going to catch some major air.
"Catch some major air" 是一种俚语，通常用于极限运动（如滑雪、滑板或自行车特技）中，意思是 "*跳得很高或飞得很远*"。

具体来说： +
"Air" 指的是在空中腾跃的时间或高度。 +
"Major" 强调程度，表示非常高或很大的跳跃。 +

在这里，"I’m going to catch some major air." 的意思是：
“我要跳一个非常高的/非常酷的动作。”
====

C: Butt 屁股 plant 栽种；种植；播种!

[.my2]
摔了个屁股墩！

[.my1]
.案例
====
"Butt plant" 是一种幽默的表达，用来描述某人跌倒时 屁股着地 的情况，特别是在滑雪、滑板或类似运动中。 +
"Butt" 指屁股。 +
"Plant" 在这里的意思是“扎下去”或“种植”，形象地表示某物突然触地。

因此，"Butt plant" 的意思就是 摔倒时屁股先着地，通常用来开玩笑或者调侃某人摔倒的样子。
====

B: Ha ha ha! He lost his skis 滑雪板! Yard （某种用途的）区域，场地；（小屋的）后院，院子 sale!!!

[.my2]
哈哈哈！他的滑雪板掉了！全场甩卖（yard sale）！！！

A: Ahem, well. Thanks for joining us here
today, I think that about does it 我想差不多就是这样了. Bob, Ian,
time for some après-ski 滑雪后的社交娱乐?

[.my2]
嗯……好吧，谢谢大家今天的收看。我想今天节目就到这里了。鲍勃，伊恩，一起去滑雪后喝点东西（après-ski）怎么样？

[.my2]
给您，先生。女士的鹅肝酱，您的蘑菇汤。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.foie gras
鹅肝是法国的传统名菜，法语称为“Foie Gras”，直译成中文为“肥肝”。其中，“Foie”是肝的意思，“Gras”是肥的、脂肪的意思。

image:/img/foie gras.jpg[,15%]
====

something else?

A: *Take* this _foie gras_ *back* as well, it’s
rubbery (a.)似橡胶的；有弹性的;(腿或膝盖) 虚弱的；软弱无力的 and completely overcooked 煮得过久的. And
look at the portion （食物的）一份，一客 size! How can you charge (v.)
twenty-five dollars for a sliver （切下或碎裂的）小块，薄片 of _duck liver_ 鸭肝?

[.my2]
把这块鹅肝也拿回去，它太软了，而且完全煮过头了。再看看份量！一条鸭肝你怎么能要价25美元呢？

B: Right away 立刻,马上... sir.

C: Honey come on! The _foie gras_ was fine,
why are you *making such a big deal* 小题大做? Are you
trying to get our meal comped (v.)免费提供，赠送 again?

[.my2]
亲爱的，快点！鹅肝酱很好，你干嘛小题大做？你是不是又想让餐厅免费给我们这顿饭？

[.my1]
.案例
====
.make a big deal
If someone makes a big deal out of something, they make a fuss about it or treat it as if it were very important. 小题大做,大惊小怪

.make a big deal (out) of (something)
to treat (something) as very important or too important.

.Are you trying to get our meal *comped* again?
句子中的 "comped" 是 "(a.) complimentary 免费的；赠送的" 的缩写形式，用于非正式语境，意思是 "免费赠送" 或 "免单"。在餐饮业中，"to comp a meal" 意味着餐厅为顾客免去餐费，通常是因为服务问题或食物质量问题。

在这句话里，"Are you trying to get our meal comped (v.) again?" 的意思是：
“你是不是又想让他们把我们的餐费免掉？” +
这带有一种戏谑或责备的语气，暗示对方可能经常因为挑剔食物或找麻烦, 来争取免单。

虽然 "complimentary" 是形容词，但 "comp" 已经从中演变为一个动词.

comped 既可以用作动词，也可以作形容词化的表达。

1.作为动词（过去分词）使用 +
在 "Are you trying to get our meal comped (v.) again?" 中，"comped" 是动词 "to comp" 的过去分词，作宾补，表示 “让我们的餐费被免掉”。

2.作为形容词使用（过去分词作形容词） +
如果用在句子中形容某件事物，比如： +
- "Our meal was comped (a.)."（我们的餐费被免掉了。） +
-  "The tickets are comped (a.)."（这些票是免费的。） +
在这种情况下，"comped" 的功能类似于形容词，但它的本质依然是过去分词。

[.my2]
既然我们已经讨论了我们灾难性的第一季度的血腥细节！给我们一些好消息。我们这个月的销售情况如何？

[.my1]
.案例
====
.gory
-> 来自gore, 刺伤。
====

B: Uh well...would you like the bad news first
or the really bad news?

[.my2]
你想先听"坏消息", 还是"真正的坏消息"？

A: What? Ed, don’t tell me you only have bad
news!

B: Well sir, our sales have dropped, no
plunged (v.)使突然前冲（或下落）;暴跌；骤降；突降, fifty percent in the past month
alone. We are currently overstocked (a.)库存过多 and
overstaffed (a.)人浮于事的；人员过多的 and our profits 利润；收益；赢利 are falling fast.
The market is in recession （经济的）衰退（期） and we have no
way of moving our inventory （商店的）存货，库存, or *getting rid of* 摆脱；丢弃；扔掉

packages_ （必须整体接收的）一套东西，一套建议；一揽子交易. It’s a real mess （组织欠佳等导致的）麻烦，困境，混乱.

[.my2]
我们的销售额下降了，不是暴跌，仅上个月就下降了50%。我们目前库存过剩，人手过剩，利润也在迅速下降。市场正在衰退，我们没有办法转移库存，也没有办法解雇我们的员工。如果我们考虑裁员，那将会花费我们一大笔钱，因为新的薪酬规定。真是一团糟。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.inventory
-> in-,进入，使，-vent,来，来到，词源同advent,venture.即来到，到达，引申词义找到，发现，后用于指发现的存货，清单等。
====

A: *For crying out loud* （表示愤怒或失望）哎呀，我的天哪，真是岂有此理... How fast are we
losing (v.) money?

[.my2]
我的天啊……我们亏损的速度有多快？

B: Um...how can I put this? Let’s just say
that at this pace 步速，（移动的）速度；（发生、进展、发展的）速度，节奏, we will *be filing (v.)（file 的现在分词形式） for*  提起（诉讼）；提出（申请）；送交（备案） _Chapter
eleven_ in less than three months.

[.my2]
我该怎么说呢？照这样下去，我们不到三个月就要申请破产保护了。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.file
(v.)( law 律) ~ (for sth) : to present sth so that it can be officially recorded and dealt with 提起（诉讼）；提出（申请）；送交（备案）

.Chapter leven
Chapter Eleven 是美国《破产法》（U.S. Bankruptcy Code）中的第十一章，专门用于公司或个人进行 "重组破产"（reorganization bankruptcy）。它允许企业在债务压力下继续运营，同时制定计划来偿还债权人, 并恢复盈利能力。 + +
在这个对话中，"filing for Chapter eleven" 的意思是企业即将面临严重的财务困境，不得不申请破产保护, 以避免倒闭。

Chapter Eleven 的具体内容和作用：

- 保护企业免受债权人起诉 : +
一旦企业提交 Chapter 11 申请，就会**进入"破产保护"阶段，暂时停止所有债权人的催收, 或起诉行动。**

- 继续运营: +
与 Chapter 7 清算破产不同，*Chapter 11 允许企业继续运营，而不是直接清算资产。*

- 债务重组: +
*申请破产的公司, 需要提交一份"重组计划"（reorganization plan），说明如何偿还债务, 并恢复盈利。*

- 债权人投票: +
债权人和法院, 需要批准这份重组计划。

.We will be filing for
使用 "we will be filing (v.) for" 而不是 "we will file (v.) for" 是因为两种表达方式在语气和含义上有细微的差别。

- 这里使用进行时态 "will be filing(v.) for"，突出了**破产申请是一个可能即将发生的过程**，而不是单一的、具体的动作。
- "will file (v.) for" 强调破产申请**是一个明确的计划或决策，是公司已经决定要采取的下一步行动。** 比如："We will file (v.) for Chapter eleven tomorrow." 这表明已经下定决心，动作即将执行。

因此, 文中用了 We will be filing for, 这种说法带有一种被动或无奈的语气，表明这是环境压力或现实导致的结果，而不是公司的主动选择。
====

A: What! Geez 天啊! How could this have
happened? So what’s the bad news?

B: Oh, that’s the really bad news. Our
supplier suffered (v.)遭受，经历 QC 质量控制（Quality Control） problems and, well, half
of our production is faulty 有故障的，有缺陷的. We’re going to
have to recall 召回（运动员），使归队； 收回（有问题的产品） all items sold in the last
quarter. And the worst part? We’re going to
have to shoulder (v.)承担，担负 this cost.


[.my2]
哦，这真是个坏消息。我们的供应商出现了质量控制问题，我们一半的产品都有问题。我们将不得不召回上一季度售出的所有商品。最糟糕的是什么？我们将不得不承担这笔费用。

A: Are you joking? *Get* the supplier *on the
line* 联系某人 now! They have to assume (v.)承担（责任）；就（职）；取得（权力） the costs of
this mess!

[.my2]
你在开玩笑吗？马上给供应商打电话！他们必须承担这个烂摊子的代价！

[.my1]
.案例
====
"Get someone on the line" 是一个英语习语，意思是联系某人，通常指通过电话。 +
"Get the supplier on the line now!" 是：“马上给供应商打电话联系！”。
====

B: We tried that, sir. The factory has *gone
under*  (商行) 倒闭; (项目) 失败 and the owner apparently 据…所知；看来；显然 has fled (v.) the
country.

[.my2]
我们试过了，先生。工厂倒闭了，厂主显然已经逃出国了。

A: We’re doomed 注定的，命定的；注定要失败的!

[.my2]
我们完蛋了

B: There is some really good news though 虽然，尽管；可是，不过!

A: Really? What!

B: I got offered a new job!

[.my2]
我得到了一份新工作！

[.my1]
.案例
====
“I #got offered# a new job!” 里的 “got offered” 是 “get + 过去分词” 的被动语态，用来表达“某人受到了某种行为”的意思。

在这里，“I *got offered* a new job” 的意思是：“我**被提供**了一份新工作。” *这是一种口语化的表达，与 “I #was offered# a new job” 意思相同，但 “got offered” 更加随意, 且常见于日常对话。*

这种用法在口语中非常普遍，*用来表达“某件事发生在我身上”或“我受到了某种待遇”*，例如： +
- I *got invited* to the party. （我被邀请去参加派对。） +
- She *got promoted* last week. （她上周被升职了。） +
总结：*这里的 “get done” 是一种##被动语态##，表示事情是由外力作用于主语而发生的。*

with my main man, Bob Copeland.

B: Thank you, Rick! As you can see, ladies
and gentleman, we are here in beautiful
Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the
world are trying to win the grand prize of one
million dollars!

A: Whoa, that’s a lot of cash! Let’s go to the
course and see how Tiger Woods is doing.

B: All right, were’re here at the eighth hole.
It’s a par four, and has some very difficult
hazards which many golfers find difficult to
avoid. Although, I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a
hole in one on this very same hole!

A: Tiger Woods is about to tee off, and let’s
see if he has the same luck as Jack. Tiger is
asking his caddie for his driver and, he
seems to be very nervous.

B: Oh no! Not a good swing at all! It’s
definitely not his day today. On the seventh
hole he got a bogey and before that he
barely made par. He will definitely not get a
birdie on this shot.

A: It seems that his ball has flown

B: Yes, yes I did. Please come in! I’m so glad
you came! This old house is falling apart!
Come on into the bathroom. See, here,
there’s water leaking everywhere!

A: I see. Let me have a look. It seems that
your toilet is clogged, and that’s why it won’t
flush. Let me just get my plunger. No, that’s
not working either. I suspect that there’s
some sort of foreign object in the pipes that’s
causing a blockage. That’s what’s making
your toilet overflow.

B: Oh, that must be because of my fouryear-
old daughter. She is always flushing
things down the toilet. You know how kids
are.

A: Yeah, I have a little one myself. Anyway,
these water pipes are really rusty, so they
also should be changed. That could be
causing water to not drain completely; that
might lead to more problems in the future. I
would also suggest fixing this faucet that
isn’t shutting off properly. I could have it all
finished by today if it’s urgent.

B: That would be great! Is it expensive?

A: Let’s see... I would say about eight
hundred dollars.

B: What? That’s more than I make in a day

== Elementary‐The Office‐You MissedTheDeadline! (C0116)

A: And so, I just wanted to check in with you
and find out where we are with this project.
As you know, you’ve missed a fairly
significant deadline last week, and this will
negativity impact the team’s ability to move
forward with the next stages of this project.

B: I know, I’m really sorry that I missed the
deadline. But really, it wasn’t my fault. You
see, we had all of these unexpected technical
problems at the last minute, and that I
couldn’t get into the database and extract
the kind of information that I needed for the
data analyis. You know, if the tech guys
would have done their job and kept the CRM
stable, then I wouldn’t have missed my
deadline.

A: Oh, come on! An excuse like that is
tantamount to lying. You’re essentially
blaming the tech team for your time
management issues, rather than accepting
responsibility for the fact that you were
procrastinating for the past two weeks.

B: No, I’m not trying to pass the buck here; I
know that it was me who is ultimately
responsible for getting this done. But the
thing is, I could have finished on time if the
system hadn’t gone down. And you know,
with everything I’ve got going on now, I can’t
afford to waste time dealing with technical
problems. I’ve got a lot on my plate and
there are only twenty-four hours in a day...

A: I’m not going to accept this excuse.
You’re using these small technical glitches as
a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact
that you’ve missed your deadline. Look, we
have standards and I expect you to live up to
those standards. No more phoney excuses. If
you’re in over your head, you tell me. No
more missed deadlines. Now, I want that
data on my desk by nine am!
