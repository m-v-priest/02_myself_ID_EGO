== Elementary ‐ The Weekend ‐ 1970’s (C0101)

A: Hey man! How’s it hanging?

B: Hey man! Everything is just groovy baby!

A: Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday?
I heard it was far out, man!

B: I wanted to, but I ran into this foxy lady
that just moved to my block! I was chatting
her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her
place.

A: Right on, right on! Well, Jim went to the
rink with Sherry and he said it was dy-nomite!
He was low on bread, but Sherry paid
for everything.

B: Gravy! Jim is such a jive turkey man. He
is always hitting me up for cash. Anyway,
you wanna book and go grab some grub?

A: Yeah man, I’m starving!

== Elementary ‐ Global View ‐ Global Warming (C0102)

A: And therefore, global warming is the
greatest deception of the early 21st century.
Questions?

B: Uh& yeah. In the lecture you said theres
more evidence in the scientific record
supporting global cooling?

A: Well, yes, essentially, the historical record
supports a theory of climate cycles. Warming
and cooling are cooperating processes in the
planetary eco-system.

B: If thats true and the planet is getting
cooler, what explains the rapid melting of the
polar ice caps and the dramatic rise in the
global average temperatures?

A: But are global temperatures rising? If you
look at the data from nineteen seventy-five
youll&

B: Youll be misled. If you were serious, you
would look at the record starting in the
1880s. Then you would see how dramatically
the earths temperature has changed.

A: Young lady, I beg to differ. Look, the point
of the lecture was to emphasize that there is
evidence for both sides, and I’m putting forth
the argument that there’s greater evidence
in support of the global cooling hypothesis.
Look, it’s an indisputable fact that the public
is being manipulated and scared into
believing theres some kind of climate crisis;
this scaremongering is done, quite simply,
for political reasons.

B: But even without the uncomfortable
reality that greenhouse gases like carbon
dioxide contribute to global warming, isnt the
topic appropriate for politicians to discuss?

A: Not if they want to use your tax dollars
and mine to fund completely unnecessary
initiatives.

B: Yeah, like conservation, protecting
endangered species and investing in
renewable energy. At the very least, you
have to concede that this debate has the
potential to end our dependence on foreign
oil. Buying oil supports autocratic countries
that use these revenues to devastating ends.

A: Why, Ive never been so disrespected in all
of my days. I’m a professor, a scientist and
researcher of high regard.

B: Yeah, and a duplicitous one at that.
Everyone knows youre in the pocket of the
oil lobby. Why should we trust your so-called
findings more than tobacco institute studies
which say smoking doesnt harm health?
Youre full of it.

A: Some people just cannot handle civil
debate!

A: I want to know where this relationship is

A: I’m awesome. Well, I guess that’s my

B: Honey...

A: Look, if you don’t love me, it’s not a thing,
alright, we’ve had our laughs, but I don’t

A: That’s right, Bob, but today we have a
special treat for our viewers. We’re joined
here by Ian Roussy, the four-time giant
slalom champion. And on this
special edition of the show, Ian is going to
teach
us the basics of skiing! So, let’s hit the
slopes!

C: Well, first off, let’s get those boots on.
You’re going
to want to make sure your boots fit snugly.
That’s right; now snap them into your
bindings.
And you’re also going to want a good pair of
goggles
to protect your eyes. It’s a bright day today,
so there’s going to be a lot of glare out there
on
the slopes. We don’t want you hitting any of
thosemoguls!

A: Bob, since you’re a beginner skier and
might take a few spills, it is a good idea to
have a good warm pair of dry ski gloves.

C: Easy there, Rick! Well, let’s head on over
to the chairlift, and test your skills! All right,
we’re up here on the bunny hill, so, Bob, why
don’t you do a few snow-plow turns. Gnarly
run, Rick! Nice carving! You’ve got some mad
skills! That was sick!

A: You wanna see gnarley? Well, see that
bump over there, I’m going to catch some
major air.

C: Butt plant!

B: Ha ha ha! He lost his skis! Yard sale!!!

A: Ahem, well. Thanks for joining us here
today, I think that about does it. Bob, Ian,
time for some après-ski?

C: No way, man! We’re off to grab some
freshies!!!

== Elementary ‐ The Office ‐ Job Well Done(C0105)

A: And so, that concludes my outline for our
marketing strategy next year. Thank you
very much for your time.

B: Hey, that was quite the Presentation!
Honestly, I was completely blown away by
your strategy outline. I’ve gotta say, Alex,
you really wowed me today.

A: Aw, come on; it was nothing. Im just
doing my job.

B: No, I think you deserve some recognition
here; I mean, if I look back on your previous
Presentations, this is a huge improvement.

A: Well, Kristin did give me a hand with the
slides. Shes a real wiz on PowerPoint.

B: And I saw that you took on board my
feedback about pricing strategies. I really
appreciate you taking the time to think
though my suggestions.

A: Yeah, well, that was some good advice.
You made some really good points.

B: Well, I just wanted to say well done.
Really you did a great job.

== Elementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ Mobile Phone Plan (C0106)

B: Yeah, I’ve just moved here, and I’d like to
activate my cell phone, and I’m not sure if I
should go with a prepaid plan, or a monthly
rate plan.

A: I see. Well, can I have a look at your
phone? Unfortunately, this phone can’t be
used in the US; it’s not compatible with our
3G network.

B: What? Really? I don’t really want to have
to buy a new phone.

A: Well, you’re in luck! You see, if you sign
up for our three-year plan, we’ll throw in a
handset for free.

B: Really? What’s the catch?

A: There’s no catch! You just choose a plan,
sign a three-year contract and, that’s it!
Actually, we’re running a special promotion
right now, and we’re giving away a
Blackberry Curve with our special Mega Value
forty dollar plan.

B: So what does this plan include?

A: Well, you get nine hundred anytime

== Elementary‐Daily Life Complaining at a Restaurant (C0107)

A: Excuse me, waiter? Waiter!

B: Yes, sir? What can I do for you?

A: I’ve been sitting here for the past twenty
minutes and no one has offered me a glass
of water, brought any bread to the table and
our appetizers haven’t been served yet! You
know, in this kind of establishment, I’d
expect much better service.

B: I am sorry, sir. I’ll check on your order
right away.

C: Relax honey, the place is busy tonight, but
I’ve heard the food is amazing. Anyway...

B: Here you are, sir. The foie gras for the
lady, and a mushroom soup for you.

A: Waiter, I ordered a cream of mushroom
soup with asparagus. This soup is obviously
too runny, and it’s over-seasoned. It’s
completely inedible!

B: Okay, I do apologize for that. Can I bring
you another soup, or would you like to order
something else?

A: Take this foie gras back as well, it’s
rubbery and completely overcooked. And
look at the portion size! How can you charge
twenty-five dollars for a sliver of duck liver?

B: Right away... sir.

C: Honey come on! The foie gras was fine,
why are you making such a big deal? Are you
trying to get our meal comped again?

A: What do you mean? We are paying for
this. If I’m shelling out my hard earned
bucks, I expect value for money!

B: Here you are, sir. I hope it is alright now.
The chef has prepared it specially for you.

A: Yes, fine.

C: Honey, are you alright?

== Elementary ‐ The Office ‐ Bad news, boss. (C0108)

A: ... Now that we have been over the gory
details of our disastrous first quarter, Ed!
Give us some good news. How are things
looking for us in terms of sales this month?

B: Uh well...would you like the bad news first
or the really bad news?

A: What? Ed, don’t tell me you only have bad
news!

B: Well sir, our sales have dropped, no
plunged, fifty percent in the past month
alone. We are currently overstocked and
overstaffed and our profits are falling fast.
The market is in recession and we have no
way of moving our inventory, or getting rid of
our staff. If we consider redundancies, it
would cost us a fortune because of the new
regulations governing compensation
packages. It’s a real mess.

A: For crying out loud... How fast are we
losing money?

B: Um...how can I put this? Let’s just say
that at this pace, we will be filing for Chapter
eleven in less than three months.

A: What! Geez! How could this have
happened? So what’s the bad news?

B: Oh, that’s the really bad news. Our
supplier suffered QC problems and, well, half
of our production is faulty. We’re going to
have to recall all items sold in the last
quarter. And the worst part? We’re going to
have to shoulder this cost.

A: Are you joking? Get the supplier on the
line now! They have to assume the costs of
this mess!

B: We tried that, sir. The factory has gone
under and the owner apparently has fled the
country.

A: We’re doomed!

B: There is some really good news though!

A: Really? What!

B: I got offered a new job!

A: We need to talk.

B: Okay...

A: I’ve been thinking, and well, I think we
need to start seeing other people.

B: What? Why? I mean, we’ve had our ups
and downs, and we have the occasional
disagreement, but we’re happy together,
aren’t we?

A: That’s just it, I’m not happy anymore,
Tim. It’s not you, it’s me. I know that I can
be hard to deal with, and you are a great
guy! You are the type of guy that any woman
would kill for!

B: So, what are you saying? You’re breaking
up with me because I’m perfect?

A: Tim, you are too good for me. You
deserve someone who can make you smile
and make you happy the way that you made
me happy. Oh, I could say that I’ll be all you
need, but that would be a lie. I know I’d only
hurt you, I know I’d only make you cry.

B: Baby, come on. Don’t do this to me!
Whatever it is, we can work it out. Just give
me another chance! I know that we can get
through this, but we gotta stick together!
Don’t leave me.

A: I can’t, Tim. I hope someday you can find
some way to understand I’m only doing this
for you. I don’t really wanna go but, deep in
my heart I know this is the kindest thing to
do.

B: Laura...

A: Here are your keys. I’ll send my sister to
pick up the rest of my things next week. I’m
sorry, Tim. I wish you all the best, and I
hope that one day we can meet again. I’ll
always love you. Goodbye.

like to sign up for my courses for next
semester.

B: Yes, of course. I need your student ID
please.

A: Here you are.

B: Okay, Susan. It says here that you are a
business major and you are in your second
year. Is this information correct?

A: Yes. I do want to take some additional
credits this year to get a minor in
psychology.

B: Sure. That’s not a problem. Do you have
the list of courses you want to take this
semester?

A: Yeah. Here’s my list. I’m not sure if the
class schedule will allow me to take all of
them though.

B: Yeah, that’s perfect. What about the

fundamental linguistics, consumer
psychology and neuroanatomy.

== Elementary ‐ The Weekend ‐ Golf (C0111)

A: Good morning golf aficionados! My name
is Rick Fields, and you guessed it, I am here
with my main man, Bob Copeland.

B: Thank you, Rick! As you can see, ladies
and gentleman, we are here in beautiful
Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the
world are trying to win the grand prize of one
million dollars!

A: Whoa, that’s a lot of cash! Let’s go to the
course and see how Tiger Woods is doing.

B: All right, were’re here at the eighth hole.
It’s a par four, and has some very difficult
hazards which many golfers find difficult to
avoid. Although, I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a
hole in one on this very same hole!

A: Tiger Woods is about to tee off, and let’s
see if he has the same luck as Jack. Tiger is
asking his caddie for his driver and, he
seems to be very nervous.

B: Oh no! Not a good swing at all! It’s
definitely not his day today. On the seventh
hole he got a bogey and before that he
barely made par. He will definitely not get a
birdie on this shot.

A: It seems that his ball has flown
somewhere deep in the trees. He is having a

call animal control!

== Elementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ Dr. Plumber (C0112)

A: Good afternoon! Did you call for a
plumber?

B: Yes, yes I did. Please come in! I’m so glad
you came! This old house is falling apart!
Come on into the bathroom. See, here,
there’s water leaking everywhere!

A: I see. Let me have a look. It seems that
your toilet is clogged, and that’s why it won’t
flush. Let me just get my plunger. No, that’s
not working either. I suspect that there’s
some sort of foreign object in the pipes that’s
causing a blockage. That’s what’s making
your toilet overflow.

B: Oh, that must be because of my fouryear-
old daughter. She is always flushing
things down the toilet. You know how kids
are.

A: Yeah, I have a little one myself. Anyway,
these water pipes are really rusty, so they
also should be changed. That could be
causing water to not drain completely; that
might lead to more problems in the future. I
would also suggest fixing this faucet that
isn’t shutting off properly. I could have it all
finished by today if it’s urgent.

B: That would be great! Is it expensive?

A: Let’s see... I would say about eight
hundred dollars.

B: What? That’s more than I make in a day
and I’m a heart surgeon!

C: Sorry I’m late everyone. There was a
huge traffic jam on the highway this
morning.

D: Morning everyone! Were you stuck in
traffic as well, Jess? There was a huge pileup
on the highway and traffic was backed up for
miles.

B: Scott just called and said that he’s
running late. His last meeting ran over, but
he’s on his way now.

== Elementary‐The Office‐You MissedTheDeadline! (C0116)

A: And so, I just wanted to check in with you
and find out where we are with this project.
As you know, you’ve missed a fairly
significant deadline last week, and this will
negativity impact the team’s ability to move
forward with the next stages of this project.

B: I know, I’m really sorry that I missed the
deadline. But really, it wasn’t my fault. You
see, we had all of these unexpected technical
problems at the last minute, and that I
couldn’t get into the database and extract
the kind of information that I needed for the
data analyis. You know, if the tech guys
would have done their job and kept the CRM
stable, then I wouldn’t have missed my
deadline.

A: Oh, come on! An excuse like that is
tantamount to lying. You’re essentially
blaming the tech team for your time
management issues, rather than accepting
responsibility for the fact that you were
procrastinating for the past two weeks.

B: No, I’m not trying to pass the buck here; I
know that it was me who is ultimately
responsible for getting this done. But the
thing is, I could have finished on time if the
system hadn’t gone down. And you know,
with everything I’ve got going on now, I can’t
afford to waste time dealing with technical
problems. I’ve got a lot on my plate and
there are only twenty-four hours in a day...

A: I’m not going to accept this excuse.
You’re using these small technical glitches as
a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact
that you’ve missed your deadline. Look, we
have standards and I expect you to live up to
those standards. No more phoney excuses. If
you’re in over your head, you tell me. No
more missed deadlines. Now, I want that
data on my desk by nine am!
