== The Weekend ‐ Breaking Up (C0281)
Lydia: Hello?
Maggie: Hey! Do you want to go out
tonight?
Lydia: No, I think I’ll pass. Mark broke up
with me. I feel awful.
Maggie: What?!? What happened? Just last
week you were talking about going on
vacation together!
Lydia: I don’t know what I did wrong. He
said he needed some space to figure things
out... He said I didn’t do anything wrong,
that I’m a great person... just not the one for
him...
Maggie: Ugh! That’s so cliche. Mark’s not
worth your time, Lydia. You deserve so much
better!
Lydia: I know we had hit a rough patch but I
had hoped we could work it out next
weekend, when we both had some time off...
I think he found someone else. I had been
getting suspicious because he had been
spending a lot of time with a coworker...
Maggie: Whatever. He’s a jerk, forget about
him! There are many more fish in the sea.
Lydia: Talk about being clich ′ e, Maggie! But
you’re right. There’s no use for me to sulk
around... Let’s go out tonight!

== Global View ‐ Physics (C0282)
Prof. Brown: Good morning, everybody.
Welcome to Physics 101. My name is Ed
Brown, and I will be your professor for this
semester. Since today is our first class, I
wanted to give you an overview of what this
course will look like, how you will be graded,
and what we will cover this semester.
Matt: Will we be focusing more on
theoretical physics or experimental physics,
Professor?
Prof. Brown: This is an introductory course,
and my aim is to give you a broad overview
of the field of physics. The term “ physics”
encompasses many different areas of
research and study, and I hope this course
will provide you with conceptual
understanding of physics, which will prove
useful whether or not you choose to further
your study in this field.
Prof. Brown: We will begin the course by
looking at the fundamental concepts of
physics, then by the middle of the semester
we will begin exploring the more theoretical
side of physics. It is essential that you first
have a firm grasp of the fundamentals, so
that you can better understand the
theoretical concepts when we get to them.
Matt: Will we learn about black holes,
wormholes, and string theory?
Prof. Brown: We will learn about the
general theory of relativity, including black
holes. We will also explore developing
theories in quantum mechanics, such as
string theory. We will discuss some
94
Englishpod Dialogues
hypothetical features of space-time, like
wormholes.
Prof. Brown: We will also explore some of
the more influential developments in the
fields of thermodynamics, electromagnetism,
and nuclear physics, all of which have had
significant impacts on modern life. Now, I am
going to have the TAs pass out the syllabus
for this class, so you can see how this course
will be graded.
Matt: Oh man, looks like this isn’t gonna be
the easy A I thought it’d be!

== The Office ‐ Presentation Series 5 ‐ Deferring Questions (C0283)

Mr. Ford: Now, as we have already
discussed there is a huge untapped market
out there both in Asia, in other developing
markets, and in the more mature markets for
us to push into. Now of course, this
represents an enormous challenge with
enormous rewards for the winners, but for
any new product we need a great marketing
message and marketing campaign
Mr. Ford: It needs to be directed and
focused at our target consumer, and needs to
be pitched at exactly the right level. The
question we must first address is of course,
who is our target consumer and secondly
what do they expect from the next
generation Alpha lap-top?
Mr. Ford: Let’s first of all tackle the first
question. Our target consumer for the x420
is the middle class, white collar worker with
an above average income. However, as we
mentioned before the total number of
computer owners is expanding rapidly and
we need to broaden our audience for this
product.
Mr. Ford: For example, the x420 is also
ideally suited to the younger student sector,
who might use laptops both for study and
gaming. There is no doubt that.
Audience Member: Mr. Ford, if I could just
interrupt a moment. You say that the
computer is suitable for students, but don’t
you think the price of the x420 is just too
much for most students?
Mr Ford: Well, that’s a fair point. If you
don’t mind I’d like to tackle your question a
little bit later in the Q and A section. Is that
okay?
Audience Member: Yes sure.
Mr Ford: Okay, so as I was saying we have
an exciting campaign planned for the x420.
Firstly, we will have a nationwide television
campaign, as well as advertising on radio
and also in many computer publications. We
also intend to.
Audience Member: I’m sorry to stop you
Mr. Ford, but do you really think that a
television campaign is cost effective. I mean,
how much is that going to cost?
Mr Ford: Well I don’t have the figures to
hand, but I’d be happy to discuss those
figures with you after the presentation. Okay
let me just go on to talk a little more about
the exciting campaign we have in store.

== Daily Life ‐ Tune Up (C0284)

A: Welcome to Al’s Garage. What seems to
be the problem?

B: No problem at all! I am taking a long road
trip and I want to make sure my car is in
good mechanical condition.

A: Very wise decision. When was the last
time you had a tune up?

B: Not that long ago, I think it was four
months ago.

A: We usually recommend that you bring
your car in every five thousand kilometers.

B: Why? I mean, what exactly do you do to a
car that you need to check it so often?

A: First of all, we change the motor oil and
oil filter. If you don’t do this, it can cause
your engine to wear faster and that means
you would probably have to change the
pistons and intake valves.

B: I see. What else?

A: We also check your spark plugs, fuel filter,
and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid.
We also check the clutch and brakes to
determine when you will need new ones.

B: Ok, well, when you put it that way, it
95
Englishpod Dialogues
doesn’t seem like a waste of time and
money.

A: Trust me, regular tune ups will keep your
car running smoothly and avoid break
downs.

== Daily Life ‐ Handyman (C0285)

A: The air conditioning is not working! We
need to call a handyman before we start to
fry in here!

B: Dan is on top of that. I think they are also
getting the handyman to fix the bathroom
toilet that keeps clogging up.

A: That would be convenient. They might as
well ask him to fix the electrical wiring. The
circuit breakers keep going out all the time.
It’s really annoying!

B: Yeah you are right. This office is falling
apart! Frank told me the other day that the
gutters outside were clogged and that’s why
the parking lot was flooded.

A: I know! I was in ankle deep water trying
to get to my car that day! The handyman
definitely has his work cut out for him.




'''

== The Office ‐ Presentation Series 6 ‐ Addressing the Audience (C0286)

Mr. Ford: The campaign that we have in
store for the x420 is exciting, imaginative
and revolutionary. We have spent two years
listening to and responding to feedback from
customers and staff alike.
Mr. Ford: I would like to say that without
the assistance and support of each and every
one of you we really could not have devised
this campaign. I’d like to take my hat off and
really thank you all for the wonderful work
you’ve done so far, not only in helping
support our marketing efforts, but also in
your continuing your commitment to Alpha
computers.
Mr. Ford: There’s no doubt in my mind that
we have a great workforce here and together
we can really push Alpha computers to a
whole new level of success.
Mr. Ford: On the subject of the campaign let
me ask you all a question. How do we define
the perfect lap-top? Is it about affordability,
quality, speed, reliability? What do you look
for in a consumer? Well, I believe the answer
lies in a combination of all of these elements.
Mr. Ford: Our campaign will really hammer
home the point that the x420 is a stateofthe-
art laptop for all of your computing
needs. With our television campaign we hope
to really reach out to a huge audience. Mr.
Ford: We have a great ad campaign planned
focusing on the fantastic USP’ s of the x420.
We have hired one of the best PR companies
to work with us on the campaign, and have
already completed three separate TV
adverts, all focusing on one key feature of
the x420.
Mr. Ford: I’m excited to say that today, for
the first time, we will unveil to all of you here
the first of these advertisements!

== Daily Life ‐ High School Reunion (C0287)

A: I hate coming to high school reunions.

B: It will be great honey. We will get to see
your old classmates and catch up to see how
they have been doing.

A: Yeah I guess so. Oh look! There is Robert
Matthews! Rob!

C: Hey Bill! Wow great to see you!

A: Likewise! It’s been a long time! This is my
wife Dorthy.

C: Pleasure to meet you. So Bill, how have
you been?

A: Can’t complain! We have 2 children who
are in college and my business is going well.
What about you?

C: Ah you know me! I am a dedicated
bachelor. I never married although I do have
a beautiful daughter with Mary, you
remember her? We were high school
sweetheart, didn’t really work out between
us, but I really can’t complain either.

A: That’s good. Have you seen Frank? I was
hoping he would come tonight.

C: You didn’t hear? Frank passed away last
96

year.

A: Are you serious?

C: Nah! I’m just yanking your chain. He’ll be
here soon. I saw him just last week and he
told me he would show up.

== The Weekend ‐ Getting A Tattoo (C0288)

A: I have made up my mind. I am getting a
tattoo.

B: Really? Are you sure?

A: Yeah! Why not? They are trendy and look
great! I want to get a dragon on my arm or
maybe a tiger on my back.

B: Yeah but, it is something that you will
have forever! They use indelible ink that can
only be removed with laser treatment. On
top of all that, I have heard it hurts a lot!

A: Really?

B: Of course! They use this machine with a
needle that pokes your skin and inserts the
ink.

A: Oh, I didn’t know that! I thought they just
paint it on your skin or something.

B: I think you should reconsider and do
some more research about tattoos. Also, find
out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and
make sure they used sterilized needles, and
that the place is hygienic.

A: Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing!

== The Office ‐ Presentation Series 7 ‐ Handling Technical Problems (C0289)
Mr. Ford: Okay, so if we could dim the lights
Jonathan, we can kick-off with the first TV
advert. Please note that we are still in the
early days with this advert, so it might seem
a bit rough round the edges. Okay, so. just
need to click this and the advert should pop
up on the screen...
Mr. Ford: Hmmmmmm. Sorry about this.
Bear with me me a second. There seems to
be a problem with the projector. Let me see.
could you lend a hand a second? Jonathan:
It looks like the projector is not recognizing
the computer. Let me check the connection a
second... Well the connection seems okay,
and the computer is running normally.
Mr. Ford: Okay. Sorry guys. Obviously a
problem with the system. Let’s just reboot
and start over. Let’s see if this resolves the
issue.
Jonathan: Right, let’s try again. No, still
nothing Michael. There might be a technical
issue with the projector. I think maybe the
projector has overheated. We might need to
cool it down for ten minutes and start again.
I’ll call IT support to come over right now.
Mr. Ford: Okay guys. Unfortunately
technical problems do crop up from time to
time, don’t they? But it’s not a huge
problem. In the meantime while the IT guys
get to work on that I can talk a little bit more
about the advertising concept and what we
are looking to achieve overall with this
campaign.

Shop assistant: Good afternoon, sir, is
there anything I can help you with today?
Mark: umm... yeah! I’m looking for a nice
gift to give my girlfriend. Our fifth
anniversary’s next Friday. Shop assistant:
Well, I would be happy to assist you in
choosing the perfect gift for her. Is there
anything particular that you have in mind?
Mark: No, not really... I’m completely at a
loss.
Shop assistant: Well, you can give her a set
of pearl earrings, or this beautiful heartshaped
pendant. What is her favorite
gemstone?
Mark: That purple one. I’m sorry...I’ve never
bought jewelery for anyone and I’m kind of
nervous.
Shop assistant: Don’t worry, we specialize
in providing our customers a relaxed,
pressure-free shopping environment. That
stone is an amethyst. We have a range of
beautiful amethyst pieces. Take a look at this
bracelet. It’s 18K rose-gold, studded with
amethyst and blue topaz. It’s a great

Mark: Oh...wow. That’s really pretty. Jess

something a little more delicate, perhaps a

a locket. You could also get her a
timepiece—it’s both glamorous yet
functional. If you tell me a little more about
your girlfriend, maybe I can help
you find something for her. Mark: Jess? Well,
she’s very smart, and has a great sense of
humor. She’s very feminine...
Shop assistant: Perhaps you could give her
a ring?
Mark: Well...actually...I was thinking about
asking Jess to marry me...I’ve just been so
nervous.
Shop assistant: Well sir, I believe your fifth
anniversary is a great time to propose!
Mark: Okay, I’ve decided. I’m going to pop

Can I get you anything to drink?
Manny: A Coke for me, please.
Andrea: I’ll have a Sprite.
Waitress: Okay, I’ll go get that for you. Are

Andrea: Do you use MSG?
Waitress: No ma’am, we are MSG-free.
Andrea: Oh man, I haven’t had Chinese food
in so long! I want everything! This place has
the BEST sesame chicken.
Manny: Yeah, I’ve been craving Chinese for
such a long time. I used to get take-out all
the time. It’s definitely been a while. Let’s
start off with some crab rangoon.
Andrea: Ooh yeah, that sounds good. I think
I’m going to get the sesame chicken with
fried rice, a spring roll, and egg drop soup.
Manny: It’s so tempting to order everything
on the menu, it all looks so appetizing! I
think I’ll get General Tso’s chicken, hot and
sour soup, fried wontons, and white rice.
Andrea: Aren’t you supposed to be on a
diet? You should at least get brown rice.
Manny: I don’t think so! I hate brown rice,
and I’m so sick of eating healthy all the time.
I’ve been eating so much salad I swear I’ve
forgotten what meat tastes like! There’s no
better remedy than some nice, greasy,

== The Office ‐ Presentation Series 8 ‐ Common Presentation Mistakes (C0292)
Mr. Ford: So as I mentioned previously the
campaign advertisement will focus on those
key elements that every consumer looks for
in a quality laptop: affordability, quality,
speed and reliability. We have pulled out all
the stops to produce a product that really
rivals all our competitors.
Mr. Ford: Actually, just to illustrate my point
let me give you an anecdote here. I
remember last year I was playing golf with
one of our key suppliers. It was a lovely
summer afternoon. Anyway, I invited our
supplier for a game of golf, and wanted to
get his input on the new x420.
Mr. Ford: Actually, I often get together with
him for a good game of golf. It really is a
wonderful way to relax. To be honest, I’m not
that great at golf, but I have improved in the
last few years. But the key to golf is practice,
practice, practice. I’ve lost my thread. What
was I talking about again?
Jonathan: I think you were discussing the
campaign advertisement Michael.
Mr. Ford: Yes, excuse me. I’m afraid I got
sidetracked there. Yes anyway, the
campaign. Well, erm. let me see. Is the
projector working yet Jonathan?
Jonathan: No sorry, IT are still fixing it.
Mr. Ford: Ahh okay, erm... all the
information on the campaign is on the
98

PowerPoint. I haven’t actually got my notes
with me...ermlet me see, erm.....
Audience Member: Mr. Ford, could you at
least tell us the schedule for the campaign?
When are the first advertisements scheduled
for?
Mr. Ford: That’s a good question.
Unfortunately I erm...don’t have that
information on me. I will have to get back to
you on that point.
Jonathan: Okay Michael, the projector is
fixed. I think we’re ready.
Mr. Ford: Thank goodness. Okay everyone,
sorry for the delay. So without further ado
the new x420 marketing campaign! Enjoy!
oh ermmm. I’m terribly sorry, this is not the
advert, this is my golfing holiday in
Barbados. I think I must have brought the
wrong file. Can we take five?

== Advanced Media ‐ Cheese Lovers (F0293)

A: Hello everyone my name is Laurie and I
want to welcome you to this course. We will
learn all about one of the oldest yet most
delicious foods on this planet; cheese! Let’s
get started!

A: Cheese is usually categorized intofour
types: soft, semi- soft semi-hard and hard.
The designation refers to the amount of
moisture in the cheese, which directly affects
its texture. Making cheese is an ancient
practice, dating back thousands of years, and
the home cheese maker can usually find
recipes for cheese that falls into any of the
four categories.

A: Soft cheese includes cottage cheese,
cream cheese, ricotta, brie, bleu, roquefort,
mozzarella, meunster and similar cheeses.
These cheeses generally pair well with fruit
or meats, or can be used as breakfast
cheeses in an omelette Nor as pasta fillings.
They are usually mildly flavored and very
high in moisture.

A: American, Colby, co-jack and similar
cheeses are inthe semi-soft category. These
are slightly stronger in flavor and cover a
wide range of uses. Co-jack cheese, a blend
of Colby and Monterrey jack is one of the
most popular. This allows the sharper flavor
of Colby to be combined with the milder jack
cheese, and also melts better than plain
Colby. Grilled cheese sandwiches often use
American cheese, and Mexican cheeses such
as Asadero and Queso Fresco are becoming
more popular.

A: Hard cheeses include Parmesan, Romano,
Asiago, Swiss, Gruyere and others. Parmesan
and Romano are most familiar as the grated
powder used to top spaghetti, but they are
also used as accompaniments for fruit, wine,
nuts and other appetizer items. Swiss is a
popular sandwich cheese and melts well,
unlike some other hard cheeses.

== Daily Life ‐ Picking A University (C0294)

A: I’ve never heard of AmLion College. Could
you...

B: Of course sir, let me give you a brief
overview. AmLion College is located in the
center of New York city. The school covers a
wide range of academic subjects; and eighty
percent of the courses are transferable to
other state universities. And, last year
AmLion College was ranked number one in
terms of graduate employment.

A: Interesting, and what about the tuition
fees, then?

B: You’ll be looking at somewhere around
fifteen thousand US dollars per semester.

A: Okay, well.

B: And, did I mention our on-campus
housing? Students can stay in our newly
renovated dorms for as little as three
thousand dollars per month!

A: Sounds good. Well. I’ll just grab one of
your flyers.

B: Sir, you got the wrong flyer. Sir, sir!

== The Office ‐ Presentation Series 9 ‐ Summary and Conclusion (C0295)

Mr. Ford: Right everyone. I apologize that I
can’t show you the marketing campaign
today, but next week you will all have the
99
Englishpod Dialogues
opportunity to see if for yourselves, and I
have no doubt that you will be impressed.
Let me wrap up the presentation by
summarising my key points.
Mr. Ford: As I mentioned at the outset,
2010 represents a key year for Alpha
computers. The recession is hopefully behind
us. It is clear to everyone in the computer
industry that demand is booming, especially
in the developing markets.
Mr. Ford: If we are to succeed in this
ultracompetitive field then we really need to
push forward and offer our customers
products that meet their needs on all levels.
As I hope I have illustrated, the x420
represents the kind of computer that can
really satisfy those needs.
Mr. Ford: I gave you an idea of the kind of
revenue we expect to hit in 2010 with the
new x420 range, and believe me, this is
really just the beginning. Once we establish
the x420 in the market we have plans to
continue to expand our range with ever more
revolutionary and impressive products.
Mr. Ford: Alpha computers is dedicated to
innovation and improvement. I really see no
limit to our potential as long as we stick to
the principles I stressed earlier: quality,
excellence and service.
Mr. Ford: Before we move on to the Q and A
section I’d really like to leave you with a
quote that really sums up everything that
we’ve discussed today, and hopefully it will
provide you with the same inspiration that it
gives me.
Mr. Ford: As the great Henry Ford once said
” Quality means doing it right, when no one
is looking” Well, in fact our customers are
looking; they are looking for
us to lead the way and to give them the
quality that our competitors cannot. We
cannot let them down!

== Global View ‐ Vegan Or Vegetarian? (C0296)

A: Hey Julie, you want to go grab something

B: Sure! What do you feel like having?

A: I really feel like having a big juicy steak!

B: Oh. ok. I don’t eat meat, but that’s fine, I
am sure wherever we are going they will
have other options right?

A: I didn’t know you were a vegetarian!

B: I’m not, I am a vegan.

A: A what?

B: A vegan. I don’t eat or use any animal
based products. I don’t wear leather, eat
eggs, drink milk or anything that comes from
an animal. I used to be a pescatarian before,
which basically means you don’t eat meat,
but still have fish and seafood.

A: Wow! That’s interesting! It must be tough!

B: It’s a bit difficult to find vegetarian
friendly restaurants sometimes, but since
more and more people are vegetarians or
vegans nowadays, it’s getting a bit less
difficult.

with cream mushroom sauce, but the prawn
fettuccine is also very nice.

Sincere thanks
Michael. Jonathan: Now, I’m sure many of
you will be keen to ask some questions, so
100
Englishpod Dialogues
I’d like to open it up a Q and A session.
Please raise your hand if you have any
questions at all. Janice, go ahead.
Janice: Yes thank you Jonathan. I would just
like to go back to the comment Mr. Ford
made in regards to our competitors,
particularly Orange. Now as you know,
Orange has established themselves as the
market leader in the high-end lap-top
market.
Janice: How does Mr. Ford expect to
compete with a company that has such a
huge reputation and huge resources?
Mr. Ford: Well Janice, first of all, thanks for
a very good question. I think you have hit
the nail on the head actually. Orange are the
global leaders precisely because of their size
and power.
Mr. Ford: But, although we can’t compete in
terms of size I do believe we hold an
advantage in terms of dedication to customer
service. Yes, I admit this is a David and
Goliath battle,but don’t forget who won that
contest.
Frank: Ermmm, Mr Ford. Could you
elaborate on the actual technical details of
the x420 a little more?
Mr. Ford: I’d love to but I think we are a
little pressed for time right now. However
Jonathan has all the technical specs for you
on the powerpoint presentation, which you
can look over in your own time.
Marcie: Mr. Ford. One final question. Would
you like to join me for a game of golf this
Sunday?

A: Wait a minute, you mean you met her

B: Yeah! I signed up for a website called

details and preferences, like if you are a
smoker or if you have any pets. Then you
find people that have similar characteristics
and you can email them or chat.

A: That is kind of weird! What if she is a
psycho or something like that?

B: It’s the same as meeting people anywhere
and dating them! I am just tired of going to
