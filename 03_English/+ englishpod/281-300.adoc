== Daily Life ‐ Tune (v.)（给乐器）调音，校音;调节（发动机）；调整，使适合 Up  (C0284)

[.my1]
.案例
====
- tune up | tune sth up:  +
to adjust musical instruments so that they can play together（乐队等为乐器）调音，定弦
====

A: Welcome to Al’s Garage 车库；加油站，汽车修理厂. What seems to
be the problem 有什么问题吗?

B: No problem at all! I am taking a long road
trip and I want to make sure my car is in
good mechanical condition 机械条件;机械状况.

A: Very wise （行为或决定）明智的，高明的 decision. When was the last
time you had a _tune up_ 调整（发动机或自行车传动系统）以提高性能?

[.my1]
.案例
====
- ​tune up​: /tuːn ʌp/ n. a series of adjustments made to a car’s engine to ensure it runs smoothly (调校).
====

B: Not that long ago 没那么久, I think it was four
months ago.

A: We usually recommend that you *bring*
your car *in* every five thousand kilometers.

B: Why? I mean, **what exactly do you do** to a
car that you need to check it so often?

A: First of all, we change the _motor oil_ 机油 and
_oil filter_ 油滤器. If you don’t do this, it can cause
your engine to wear (v.)磨损；消耗；用旧 faster and that means
you would probably have to change the
pistons 活塞 and _intake 摄入，吸入 valves_ (阀门；[解剖]瓣膜) 进气阀.

[.my2]
我们会更换"发动机油", 和"机油滤清器"。如果不这样做，可能会导致"发动机"磨损加快，这意味着您可能不得不更换"活塞"和"进气阀"。


[.my1]
.案例
====
- oil filter​:  n. a device that removes impurities 杂质 from the engine oil (机油滤清器). 油滤器：一种设计用于**去除**发动机油、变速器油、润滑油, 或液压油中的**杂质**的过滤器

.intake valves
​ /ˈɪn.teɪk vælvz/ n. components that control the flow of air and fuel into the engine (进气阀). +
进气门：内燃机中的一种阀门，用于控制空气和燃料混合物进入燃烧室。 +

image:/img/intake valves.jpg[,15%]

image:/img/diesel-engine-sequence-fuel-intake-valve-cycle.webp[,80%]

进气门，也就是intake valves，是发动机内部非常关键的小部件。想象一下，发动机就像一个不断重复呼吸的强力机器。进气门就是这个机器的“鼻孔”或“嘴”，负责在发动机运行时“吸气”。

当发动机启动后，每个气缸都会经历一系列的步骤，其中一个是“进气行程”。在这个时候，进气门会按照精确的时间打开，允许空气（在汽油发动机中，通常是空气和汽油混合物）进入气缸。这个过程就像是你深呼吸时鼻子和嘴巴张开，让新鲜空气进入肺部一样。

进气门的大小、开启和关闭的时机（这通常由凸轮轴控制）对发动机的性能至关重要。它们确保在正确的时间有足够的混合气进入，从而让发动机能够高效地做工，推动汽车前进。一旦气缸完成了做工，进气门会关闭，准备下一次的进气，整个过程循环往复，让发动机持续运转。所以，可以说进气门是发动机高效工作的起点。

====

B: I see. What else?

A: We also check your _spark plugs_ 火花塞, fuel filter 燃油滤清器,
and other oil levels such as *hydraulic （通过水管等）液压的，水力的 fluid* 液压油.
We also check the clutch  离合器踏板 and brakes to
determine when you will need new ones.

[.my2]
我们还会检查火花塞、燃油滤清器, 以及其他油液，比如液压油。我们还会检查离合器和刹车，以确定您何时需要更换新的。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.spark plugs​
/spɑːrk plʌɡz/ n. components that ignite the fuel-air mixture in an engine (火花塞). +
一种用于内燃机中的零件，通过产生火花, 来点燃混合气体，使发动机正常工作。

image:/img/spark plugs.jpg[,15%]



.fuel filter​
/ˈfjuː.əl ˈfɪl.tər/ n. a device that removes impurities from the fuel (燃油滤清器). +
汽车内燃机"燃油管路"上的一个附件，用于在进入"化油器"之前, 过滤液体。 +

燃油滤清器（Fuel filter）, 有柴油滤清器（Diesel filter）、汽油滤清器（Fuel Filter）和天然气滤清器（Gas filter）三类。*"燃油滤清器"的作用, 是阻止"燃油"中的颗粒物、水及不洁物，保证燃油系统精密部件, 免受磨损及其他损害。*

image:/img/fuel filter.jpg[,15%]



.hydraulic fluid​
/haɪˈdrɔː.lɪk ˈfluː.ɪd/ n. a liquid used to transmit power in hydraulic systems (液压油). +
一种通常具有低粘度的液体，用于液压机构中的液压操作。

.clutch
/klʌtʃ/ n. a device that connects and disconnects the engine from the transmission (离合器).

B: Ok, well, when you put it that way 既然你这么说, it
doesn’t seem like a waste of time and
money.

A: Trust me, regular *tune ups* 调整（发动机或自行车传动系统）以提高性能 will keep your
car running smoothly and avoid *break downs* 停止运行;故障.

== The Office ‐ Presentation Series 6 ‐ Addressing the Audience (C0286)

Mr. Ford: The campaign that we have in
store for the x420 is exciting, imaginative
and revolutionary. We have spent two years
listening to and responding to feedback from
customers and staff alike.
Mr. Ford: I would like to say that without
the assistance and support of each and every
one of you we really could not have devised
this campaign. I’d like to take my hat off and
really thank you all for the wonderful work
you’ve done so far, not only in helping
support our marketing efforts, but also in
your continuing your commitment to Alpha
computers.
Mr. Ford: There’s no doubt in my mind that
we have a great workforce here and together
we can really push Alpha computers to a
whole new level of success.
Mr. Ford: On the subject of the campaign let
me ask you all a question. How do we define
the perfect lap-top? Is it about affordability,
quality, speed, reliability? What do you look
for in a consumer? Well, I believe the answer
lies in a combination of all of these elements.
Mr. Ford: Our campaign will really hammer
home the point that the x420 is a stateofthe-
art laptop for all of your computing
needs. With our television campaign we hope
to really reach out to a huge audience. Mr.
Ford: We have a great ad campaign planned
focusing on the fantastic USP’ s of the x420.
We have hired one of the best PR companies
to work with us on the campaign, and have
already completed three separate TV
adverts, all focusing on one key feature of
the x420.
Mr. Ford: I’m excited to say that today, for
the first time, we will unveil to all of you here
the first of these advertisements!

rivals all our competitors.
Mr. Ford: Actually, just to illustrate my point
let me give you an anecdote here. I
remember last year I was playing golf with
one of our key suppliers. It was a lovely
summer afternoon. Anyway, I invited our
supplier for a game of golf, and wanted to
get his input on the new x420.
Mr. Ford: Actually, I often get together with
him for a good game of golf. It really is a
wonderful way to relax. To be honest, I’m not
that great at golf, but I have improved in the
last few years. But the key to golf is practice,
practice, practice. I’ve lost my thread. What
was I talking about again?
Jonathan: I think you were discussing the
campaign advertisement Michael.
Mr. Ford: Yes, excuse me. I’m afraid I got
sidetracked there. Yes anyway, the
campaign. Well, erm. let me see. Is the
projector working yet Jonathan?
Jonathan: No sorry, IT are still fixing it.
Mr. Ford: Ahh okay, erm... all the
information on the campaign is on the
98
Englishpod Dialogues
PowerPoint. I haven’t actually got my notes
with me...ermlet me see, erm.....
Audience Member: Mr. Ford, could you at
least tell us the schedule for the campaign?
When are the first advertisements scheduled
for?
Mr. Ford: That’s a good question.
Unfortunately I erm...don’t have that
information on me. I will have to get back to
you on that point.
Jonathan: Okay Michael, the projector is
fixed. I think we’re ready.
Mr. Ford: Thank goodness. Okay everyone,
sorry for the delay. So without further ado
the new x420 marketing campaign! Enjoy!
oh ermmm. I’m terribly sorry, this is not the
advert, this is my golfing holiday in
Barbados. I think I must have brought the
wrong file. Can we take five?

== Advanced Media ‐ Cheese Lovers (F0293)

A: Hello everyone my name is Laurie and I
want to welcome you to this course. We will
learn all about one of the oldest yet most
delicious foods on this planet; cheese! Let’s
get started!

A: Cheese is usually categorized intofour
types: soft, semi- soft semi-hard and hard.
The designation refers to the amount of
moisture in the cheese, which directly affects
its texture. Making cheese is an ancient
practice, dating back thousands of years, and
the home cheese maker can usually find
recipes for cheese that falls into any of the
four categories.

A: Soft cheese includes cottage cheese,
cream cheese, ricotta, brie, bleu, roquefort,
mozzarella, meunster and similar cheeses.
These cheeses generally pair well with fruit
or meats, or can be used as breakfast
cheeses in an omelette Nor as pasta fillings.
They are usually mildly flavored and very
high in moisture.

A: American, Colby, co-jack and similar
cheeses are inthe semi-soft category. These
are slightly stronger in flavor and cover a
wide range of uses. Co-jack cheese, a blend
of Colby and Monterrey jack is one of the
most popular. This allows the sharper flavor
of Colby to be combined with the milder jack
cheese, and also melts better than plain
Colby. Grilled cheese sandwiches often use
American cheese, and Mexican cheeses such
as Asadero and Queso Fresco are becoming
more popular.

A: Hard cheeses include Parmesan, Romano,
Asiago, Swiss, Gruyere and others. Parmesan
and Romano are most familiar as the grated
powder used to top spaghetti, but they are
also used as accompaniments for fruit, wine,
nuts and other appetizer items. Swiss is a
popular sandwich cheese and melts well,
unlike some other hard cheeses.

== Daily Life ‐ Picking A University (C0294)

A: I’ve never heard of AmLion College. Could
you...

B: Of course sir, let me give you a brief
overview. AmLion College is located in the
center of New York city. The school covers a
wide range of academic subjects; and eighty
percent of the courses are transferable to
other state universities. And, last year
AmLion College was ranked number one in

A: Interesting, and what about the tuition
fees, then?

B: You’ll be looking at somewhere around
fifteen thousand US dollars per semester.

A: Okay, well.

B: And, did I mention our on-campus
housing? Students can stay in our newly
renovated dorms for as little as three
thousand dollars per month!

A: Sounds good. Well. I’ll just grab one of
your flyers.

== The Office ‐ Presentation Series 9 ‐ Summary and Conclusion (C0295)

Mr. Ford: Right everyone. I apologize that I
can’t show you the marketing campaign
today, but next week you will all have the
99
Englishpod Dialogues
opportunity to see if for yourselves, and I
have no doubt that you will be impressed.
Let me wrap up the presentation by
summarising my key points.
Mr. Ford: As I mentioned at the outset,
2010 represents a key year for Alpha
computers. The recession is hopefully behind
us. It is clear to everyone in the computer
industry that demand is booming, especially
in the developing markets.
Mr. Ford: If we are to succeed in this
ultracompetitive field then we really need to
push forward and offer our customers
products that meet their needs on all levels.
As I hope I have illustrated, the x420
represents the kind of computer that can
really satisfy those needs.
Mr. Ford: I gave you an idea of the kind of
revenue we expect to hit in 2010 with the
new x420 range, and believe me, this is
really just the beginning. Once we establish
the x420 in the market we have plans to
continue to expand our range with ever more
revolutionary and impressive products.
Mr. Ford: Alpha computers is dedicated to
innovation and improvement. I really see no
limit to our potential as long as we stick to
the principles I stressed earlier: quality,
excellence and service.
Mr. Ford: Before we move on to the Q and A
section I’d really like to leave you with a
quote that really sums up everything that
we’ve discussed today, and hopefully it will
provide you with the same inspiration that it
gives me.
Mr. Ford: As the great Henry Ford once said
” Quality means doing it right, when no one
is looking” Well, in fact our customers are
looking; they are looking for
us to lead the way and to give them the
quality that our competitors cannot. We
cannot let them down!

== Global View ‐ Vegan Or Vegetarian? (C0296)

A: Hey Julie, you want to go grab something
to eat?

B: Sure! What do you feel like having?

A: I really feel like having a big juicy steak!

B: Oh. ok. I don’t eat meat, but that’s fine, I
am sure wherever we are going they will
have other options right?

A: I didn’t know you were a vegetarian!

B: I’m not, I am a vegan.

A: A what?

B: A vegan. I don’t eat or use any animal
based products. I don’t wear leather, eat
eggs, drink milk or anything that comes from
an animal. I used to be a pescatarian before,
which basically means you don’t eat meat,
but still have fish and seafood.

A: Wow! That’s interesting! It must be tough!

B: It’s a bit difficult to find vegetarian
friendly restaurants sometimes, but since
more and more people are vegetarians or
vegans nowadays, it’s getting a bit less
difficult.

== The Weekend ‐ Ordering At An Italian Restaurant (C0297)

A: Good evening ladies. My name is Josh and
I’ll be your server tonight. May I take your
order?

B: Do you have any recommendations?

A: Well, I personally like the chicken penne
with cream mushroom sauce, but the prawn
fettuccine is also very nice.

B: Hmm. I’d like to have the grilled chicken,
but can I have spaghetti instead of penne?

A: Of course, mam. And for you?

C: I... ah..I’ll have the horse tripe.

== The Office ‐ Presentation Series 10 ‐ The Q and A Session (C0298)

Jonathan: Well everyone, I’m sure you’d
like to join me in thanking Michael for what
was a really inspirational presentation.
Sincere thanks
Michael. Jonathan: Now, I’m sure many of
you will be keen to ask some questions, so
100
Englishpod Dialogues
I’d like to open it up a Q and A session.
Please raise your hand if you have any
questions at all. Janice, go ahead.
Janice: Yes thank you Jonathan. I would just
like to go back to the comment Mr. Ford
made in regards to our competitors,
particularly Orange. Now as you know,
Orange has established themselves as the
market leader in the high-end lap-top
market.
Janice: How does Mr. Ford expect to
compete with a company that has such a
huge reputation and huge resources?
Mr. Ford: Well Janice, first of all, thanks for
a very good question. I think you have hit
the nail on the head actually. Orange are the
global leaders precisely because of their size
and power.
Mr. Ford: But, although we can’t compete in
terms of size I do believe we hold an
advantage in terms of dedication to customer
service. Yes, I admit this is a David and
Goliath battle,but don’t forget who won that
contest.
Frank: Ermmm, Mr Ford. Could you
elaborate on the actual technical details of
the x420 a little more?
Mr. Ford: I’d love to but I think we are a
little pressed for time right now. However
Jonathan has all the technical specs for you
on the powerpoint presentation, which you
can look over in your own time.
Marcie: Mr. Ford. One final question. Would
you like to join me for a game of golf this
Sunday?

== Daily Life ‐ Returning A Product (C0299)

A: Hi I would like to return this TV.

B: Sure, do you have the receipt?

A: Yeah here you go. Actually I also want to
return this keyboard.

B: Ok, may I ask what is the reason for
returning these products?

A:: The TV flickers a lot when I am watching
a movie and at times the image is not very
clear.

B: I see, and what about the keyboard?

A: I spilled some coffee on it and now it
won’t work.

B: I am sorry sir, but we can only exchange
or refund defective products, we cannot take
responsibility for misuse or damages.

A: Fine! I don’t know why they make these
things so delicate anyways.

== Daily Life ‐ Online Dating (C0300)

A: Do you want to hang out tomorrow?

B: Oh, I can’t. I have a date!

A: Really? Wow with who?

B: This girl I’ve been chatting with forthe
past couple of months. She’s really cool and
she’s driving over here this weekend.

A: Wait a minute, you mean you met her
online?

B: Yeah! I signed up for a website called
match. and it is great! You fill in all your
details and preferences, like if you are a
smoker or if you have any pets. Then you
find people that have similar characteristics
and you can email them or chat.

A: That is kind of weird! What if she is a
psycho or something like that?

B: It’s the same as meeting people anywhere
and dating them! I am just tired of going to
bars or being set up for dates by my friends!
I think this is a really cool alternative,
especially if you are a bit shy.

A: I guess it does seem logical. I’ll have to
check it out!
