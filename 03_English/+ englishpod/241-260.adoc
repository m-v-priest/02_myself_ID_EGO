== The Office ‐ Interview Skills 3 ‐ Education Background (C0241)
Mr. Parsons: Now, if I look here I see that
you completed a BA in English?
Rebecca: Yes, that’s right. After graduating
from high school in New York I attended York
University in the UK. My major was English,
and my minor was business studies . I
completed my BA in 2004.
Mr. Parsons: Yes, I’m pleased to see that
you also got a distinction.
Rebecca: Yes that’s right. I’ve always
enjoyed studying. My friends say I’m a bit of
a bookworm, but my father always pushed
us to succeed academically.
Mr. Parsons: Well, it looks like his
encouragement paid off Rebecca. So how
about extracurricular activities at University
Rebecca: Well I’ve always been keen on on
writing, so I became the editor for the
University student magazine, which I really
loved. Also I volunteered for a group called
Shelter, to help the homeless in York.
Mr. Parsons: What did that involve?
Rebecca: Providing warm meals and shelter,
especially in the winter months . I found it
really fulfilling to be part of that group .
Mr. Parsons: I’m sure. Okay, now let’s move
on to your work experience, shall we?
Rebecca: Yes, okay.

== Global View ‐ Learning The Piano (C0242)
Charles: Hi Cody, how did practicing go this
week?
Cody: Well I had several tests and an oral
presentation this week so I didn’t get a
chance to memorize the second page, but I
think I mastered the tricky section.
Charles: Great! Warm up with some scales
and arpeggios first. Good, good. This week,
work on keeping the rhythm steady when
you play the last part with the sixteenth note
. Now let’s take a look at this tricky section.
Cody: Charles? Before I start I was
wondering if it was ok if I put a small
crescendo in here and then decrescendo
back to pianissimo again over here?
Charles: It might work. I’ll have to hear it .
Show me what you’ve done. Not bad , not
bad .
Cody: It was horrible! I played play it much
better at home! Charles: It’s just nerves.
Just play the right hand for now. One two
three four five six, ta ti tri-ple-ti. Good, good.
Don’t forget the accidentals! The key
signature says that note should be a G-sharp
but now it’s a G-natural. Now add the bass
clef. You’re going too fast. Remember the
tempo for this piece is andante.
Cody: Is that better?
Charles: Yes, much better. Watch where you
lift your foot off the pedal. What was that?
Cody: Sorry! The stretch for that octave is
always hard to make.
Charles: That’s ok, keep going, you’re
moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch
your dynamics! Keep your elbows lifted.
Remember to stroke the keys, don’t pound.
That’s better! Remember that as a pianist or
any other musician, your technique will be
what separates you from the pack just as
much or more so as your musicianship.

== The Office ‐ Interview Skills 4 ‐ Talking About Work Experience (C0244)

Mr. Parsons: Right Rebecca. Now I see that
after graduating from University your first
job was.......
Rebecca: For a local paper in York called the
York Herald. Actually, I started with them as
an intern in the beginning. I was really keen
on getting some experience in the
journalistic world, and this seemed like a
good first step.
Mr. Parsons: Certainly. And after your
internship
Rebecca: They seemed impressed, and
offered me a position as a junior local news
reporter. I ended up staying two years there
actually. I was in charge of the sports news
section of the newspaper. I really enjoyed it
there, and it really helped me build my skills.
Mr. Parsons: Yes I see. But you decided to
leave them in 2006 right
Rebecca: Yes, that’s right. My husband and
I moved to London, and so I managed to find
a position with a National newspaper based
in London
Mr. Parsons: The London Weekly right
Rebecca: Yes, in some ways it was a step
down from my previous job but it did offer
me much better prospects for the future.

have an express train departing every

== The Office ‐ Interview Skills 5 ‐ Discussing Reasons For Leaving Previous Position (C0247)
Mr. Parsons: Okay, now I’d like to find out
more about your last job. I see you spent
almost four years at the London Weekly , is
that right?
Rebecca: Yes, that’s right. To be honest, the
first year was quite tough for me. I was
really just treated more like an intern. I
didn’t have many responsibilities and I found
it quite frustrating.
Mr. Parsons: So, what changed?
Rebecca: Well slowly but surely I proved
myself, and the new editor liked me so he
promoted me to features writer .
Mr. Parsons: Wow, a real step up!
Rebecca: Yes I was responsible for
restaurant and food reviews mostly. I spent
restaurant years in that position, but to be
honest it wasn’t an area of journalism I
wanted to stay in long-term.
Mr. Parsons: I see, so why did you decide
to leave finally?
Rebecca: I just felt that the paper couldn’t
offer me any new opportunities. I really
needed a more challenging role to be honest.

== Daily Life ‐ Dinnerware (C0248)

A: Honey can you set the table?

B: Um, sure. What are we having for dinner?
Do I need to put out anything in particular?

A: Well, make sure to put out the pepper and
salt shakers. I don’t know if your brother is
coming tonight so set an extra place mat just
in case.

B: Ok, should I use the fancy silverware?

A: Yeah go ahead, forks, spoons and knives.
I roasted some meat so be sure to put out
some steak knives as well.

B: I’ll also set some cups and saucers for
some coffee after dinner.

A: Honey? Have you seen our soup bowls?

B: They are in the cupboard where you keep
the gravy boat and serving dishes. Just be
careful because the wine glasses are also
there.

A: Oops!

'''

== The Weekend ‐ Making A Sandwich (C0249)

A: Welcome to our show! Today, I am going
to show you how to make the perfect
mouthwatering sandwich! Are you ready?
Let’s get started !

A: Let’s start with the basics :bread. Bread is
an important ingredient here. You need to
remember one thing -choose the bread
according to the following
criteria :freshness, crumb and color. If you
want a closed sandwich I recommend you
first toast your bread in a toaster or oven, or
grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.

A: Now that our bread is ready, let’s talk
82
Englishpod Dialogues
about the ingredients ! Of course, each
person’s palate is different, but I’m going to
give you a few tips that you’ll be able to use
when turning any sandwich into the perfect
sandwich. I would strongly recommend you
put fresh vegetables in your sandwich.

A: Do not undervalue them as they play a
big role in forming the taste and will make
the sandwich more refreshing and light. The
best choices here are evident- cucumbers,
tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper pepper or
chilli, lettuce and, of course, herbs- you can’t
go wrong with them. As for aubergines,
mushrooms and asparagus, I would
recommend you first grill them slightly with a
little touch of olive oil.

A: Last but not least, we have a wide variety
of condiments that we can add to our perfect
sandwich. We can be subtle and just add a
touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine
mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup or even
caviar to achieve a stronger flavor! It’s
always a good idea to cut your sandwich in
triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all
your ingredients falling out and staining your
shirt!

A: That’s all the time we have for today, but
join us next time where we’ll be going over
how to make the perfect lasagna! Till next
time!

== The Office ‐ Interview Skills 6 ‐ Describing Ones Strengths (C0250)
Mr. Parsons: Okay Rebecca. Now youyou’ve
given me a good idea of your work and
academic background, but what about you as
a person? How would you describe your key
strengths?
Rebecca: Well Mr. Parsons, as I mentioned
before I’m someone who needs new
challenges. I’m really focused and hard hardworking.
I think my academic results prove
this.
Mr. Parsons: Yes, true, but how about other
personal qualities? Hmmmmm, that's a
tough question. But I would have to say my
passion. I'm really passionate about
journalism and passionate about my career.
Rebecca: Well I believe I’m a good teamplayer,
but I can also work well
independently. I’m very enthusiastic and ,
well I hope my colleagues would agree, I’m
fun to work with.
Mr. Parsons: What would you say is your
most positive quality?
Rebecca: Hmmmmm, that’s a tough
question. But I would have to say my
passion. I’m really passionate about
journalism and passionate about my career.

== The Weekend ‐ Buying Makeup (C0251)

A: I’m hungry, let’s go grab a bite to eat.

B: Yeah me too. Oh! Can we stop at the shop
really fast? I lost my makeup bag at the
airport and I want to pick up a few things.

A: Will you take long?

B: No! Five minutes I promise!

A: Come on! We have been here for almost
an hour! I thought you said you were only
going to get a few things! How long does it
take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail
polish!

B: Are you crazy! You have no idea what you
are talking about! Just for my eyes I have to
get eyeliner, an eyelash curler, eye shadow,
an eyebrow pencil and mascara. Then I need
to get foundation, liquid foundation.

A: Whoa whoa whoa! Are you nuts? How
much is all this going to cost? I’m looking at
the price at each one of these little things
and it’s outrageous! This is basically a
crayon!

B: What about you? You spend as much or
more money on your razors, after shave,
cologne and gel! Not to mention how much
you spend on clothes and...

A: Fine! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon!

'''

== Global View ‐ Contraceptives (C0252)

A: Alright, settle down everyone. As part of
this school’s curriculum we’ll be covering sex
ed this week.

A: Now I want everyone to take this class
83
Englishpod Dialogues
seriously, sexual education is very important
and I want you to ask as many questions as
you can think of. Remember, there are no
stupid questions here.

B: Miss Carlton? What exactly is sexual
education? Are you going to teach us like
Kama sutra stuff like that?

A: No Jason, that’s not exactly what sex ed
is. Basically, we will talk about sexually
transmitted diseases, contraceptives and how
the male and female bodies work.

B: My older sister is in college and she takes
what she and her friends call the pill. I never
really understood what that is, but I know it
has to do with sex or something.

A: Good point Jason! This will be the topic of
our first class, contraceptives. As you
mentioned, the pill is one of the many that
exist. The birth control pill is taken daily by a
woman in order to prevent unwanted
pregnancy, but it does not protect her from
contracting STD’s from an infected person.
Another popular method is using condoms.
This is probably the best method if you have
sex, since it not only prevents a woman from
getting pregnant but also protects both from
STD’s. Yes Jason?

B: What are condoms made out of? How
exactly is it that a woman gets pregnant?

A: Condoms are usually made out of an
elastic material called Latex. As for your
other question, that’s a whole new class.

==  The Office ‐ Interview Skills 7 ‐ Describing OnesWeaknesses (C0253)
Mr. Parsons: Okay Rebecca, well I think
you’ve given me a clear impression of your
positive qualities, but let’s talk a little bit
about your weaknesses.
Rebecca: Okay, well it’s always more
difficult to describe them isn’t it?
Mr. Parsons: Definitely, but if you had to
pinpoint one weakness what would it be?
Rebecca: Well as I mentioned before, I do
tend to get frustrated if I don’t see progress
in my work or career. I suppose I’m quite a
restless character. My father always taught
me to be a high achiever so.
Mr. Parsons: So would you say if things
don’t go your way at work it could easily get
you down?
Rebecca: Well, in a way yes. But I must say
that even if I’m not completely happy in my
work I always give 110% I would never shirk
my responsibilities. I suppose sometimes
Iexpect too much too soon.
Mr. Parsons: Well, you know journalism is a
highly competitive world, so you do need to
keep pushing yourself it’s true. Okay well lets
move on to talk about the job position here
shall we?
Rebecca: Yes please.

boiled eggs, some french toast and
buttermilk pancakes!

A: Wow! You really went all out! Did you
make any coffee?

B: Yeah, just the way you like it! I also put

A: Looks good! I’ll squeeze us some fresh
orange juice.

B: Get the jam and butter while you are in
there! Oh! And don’t forget the syrup!

== Global View ‐ The Miracle Of Life (C0255)

A: Continuing with our class, today we are
going to study briefly the miracle of life.
Many of you may think you already know
how babies come to be, but I am sure that
some of the things that we will be talking
about today may surprise you. Billy can you
turn on the projector please? Thanks. Ok,
84
Englishpod Dialogues
does anyone know what this is?

B: Looks like a goat head to me!

A: Nice try, but this is a woman’s womb
which contains her uterus and ovaries. The
ovaries are packed with eggs and each
month during the middle of the menstrual
cycle, the ripest one will be sucked up by one
of the fallopian tubes. This is called ovulation
and the exact time of ovulation depends on
the length of your cycle. In an average 28
day cycle, ovulation will most likely happen
between the 12th and 15th days, counting
day 1 as the first day of your last period.

B: That’s amazing! So each month, the
woman produces these eggs and then waits
for them to be fertilized?

A: Actually, every woman is already born
with over four hundred thousand eggs! Some
will start dying off immediately and others
released during her fertile period.

B: What about the guys? I know they
produce sperm and stuff.

A: That’s right! The man’s body has a tiny
factory that produces sperm twenty four
hours a day! Each ejaculation will release
about a hundred million sperm so the factory
is always pretty busy. The sole purpose of a
sperm’s life is to fertilize the woman’s egg.

B: So, then we basically need to put oneand-
one together so we can have babies
right?

A: Yes, the man will have an orgasm during
intercourse and ejaculate sperm and semen.
Now this is where the race begins and all
those millions of sperm will race and swim
from the cervix, through the uterus to the
fallopian tubes. This could take anywhere
from forty five minutes to twelve hours! Not
all of them make it, since some go the wrong
way and get lost or simply die. Many will
actually reach the egg but only one will
penetrate it and fertilize it. Once this
happens, the egg instantly changes and
creates a protective shield once the sperm is
safely inside.

B: And then? That’s it?

A: Well, the egg will be fertilized within about
24 hours of its release. The genetic material
from the sperm combines with the genetic
material in the egg to create a new cell that
will rapidly start dividing. The woman is not
actually pregnant until that bundle of new
cells, known as the embryo, travels the rest
of the way down the fallopian tube and
attaches itself to the wall of her uterus. Any
other questions? Then let’s move on.

== The Office ‐ Interview Skills 8 ‐ Discussing Salary and Benefits (C0256)
Mr. Parsons: Okay, well I’m sure you have a
number of questions to ask me regarding the
position.
Rebecca: Yes, well Miss Childs did give me
an overview of the position over the phone,
but there were some details I’d like to clarify.
Mr. Parsons: Well feel free to ask me
anything, and I’ll try to fill in the details.
Rebecca: Could I first ask about the
remuneration package?
Mr. Parsons: Yes of course. That’s quite an
important point isn’t it? As a junior sub editor
we offer a starting salary of 150,000 HK
dollars per annum. This doesn’t include a
generous housing allowance also.
Rebecca: I understand. And are there other
bonuses included?
Mr. Parsons: Well apart from full health
insurance we do offer a company staff bonus
scheme linked to readership numbers. But
we could go through all the details of that at
a later date.
Rebecca: Well Mr. Parsons, I am flexible
when it comes to salary. The opportunity to
work in Hong Kong for you is the most
important thing for me.
Mr. Parsons: Excellent. Well, what other
questions do you have Rebecca?

A: Ummm. no.

B: It’s only the day when the world’s biggest
sporting event is kicking off.

A: What?

B: The World Cup! The first match is today!
It’s Mexico vs. South Africa! It’s going to be a
really good match! Both teams have a very
strong offense and have skilled players. I
think that South Africa will probably
dominate the first half since they are the
host country, and all.

A: I have no idea what you’re talking about.
The only sporting event we watch at home is
the Super Bowl.

B: This is bigger than the Super Bowl, man!
Teams from 32 countries compete against
each other every four years and fight to win
that trophy. They first start in a group stage
with bigger groups, each group having 4
teams. The top 2 teams pass on to an
elimination stage before going on to the
quarterfinals and semifinals.

A: Sounds interesting, but soccer doesn’t
really appeal to me.

B: Are you kidding? Over seven hundred
million people watched the final match of the
World Cup! It’s a very exciting and nerve
wracking sport! Each nation is cheering on
their team, hoping they will become the next
champion. So far Brazil is the team with the
most titles under their belt; they’re really
good!

A: All I know about soccer is that you can’t
use your hands and that players are always
falling down, trying to get a free kick or
penalty kick. It seems like a sissy sport to
me!

B: Whatever dude, I’m going to go watch the
opening match.

150 employees based in Hong Kong with
another 400 in our head office in Beijing. The
news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises

Mr. Parsons: Well, as you know Rebecca, in
journalism work hours are not exactly 9-5.
You could be on call at any time. We do have
to work very unsociable hours at times.
Rebecca: Well I am used to that Mr.
Parsons, so that’s not really a shock for me.

B: Yeah it will be fun! I have a 9mm pistol
that is really easy to shoot. I also have a
revolver that’s really fun too! They have big
targets at the range that we could use to
practice and improve your aim.

A: Yeah that would be cool! Maybe I can also
have a try at other weapons like a machine
gun or a shotgun! Maybe even a rocket
launcher or an anti tank missile! Or what
about a flame thrower!

B: Whoa, take it easy there Rambo. Don’t
get carried away. These weapons are not
toys, and you must first learn how to handle
them properly. There are basic rules that you
must abide by in order to be safe. For
example, never handle a weapon that you
haven’t inspected yourself. Always make sure
there isn’t anything in the chamber, and
never put your finger on the trigger unless
you are ready to shoot!

A: Wow, I didn’t know! It always looks so
cool and easy in the movies!

B: The reality is different you know, running
