== Global View ‐ Thai Food (C0321)

A: What did you cook?

B: Well, as you know I was in Thailand last
month,and I took a cooking class! So I
prepared some ofmy favorite dishes.

A: Great idea! As long as I don’t get food
poisoning!So what is onthe menu tonight?

B: Ok, for starters we have Tom Yam soup.
It’s a bit spicy, but really good!

A: This is delicious! The ginger and
lemongrass really gives it a nice taste!

B: Now this next dish is one of the most
famous. Foreignerscall it papaya salad butthe
proper name is Tom Sam. It is a spicy salad
made from a mix of fresh vegetables
including shredded unripened papaya and
tomato.

A: This is delicious! The combination of sour
and spicy is really interesting! I could have
this everyday!

B: Ok, now forthe last and best dish in my
opinion. This is called Pad Thai. It’s stir-fried
noodles with eggs, fish sauce, tamarind
juice, red chili pepper plus bean sprouts,
shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed
peanuts and coriander. It’s practically
Thailand’s national dish!

A: Wow, this is great! I never knew Thai food
was so creative and delicious!

B: Wantsome more?

A: I’m stuffed!

A: So what are you doing for Thanksgiving?

B: Not much really. It’s more of an American
tradition, so back home we don’t really
celebrate it. In fact, I am not even sure of
what exactly is being celebrated!

A: Well you know, it’s a time to get together
with all your family and be thankful for
everything!

be?

arrived there because of religious
persecution from England and King James.
Once inthe New World, they befriended an
native named Squanto, who taught them
how to harvest food from the area such as
corn.

B: Interesting! I am amazed how big and
delicious thanksgiving dinners are!

A: Come to my house for Thanksgiving! We
are having turkey, pumpkin pie, mashed
potatoes with gravy, and lots of stuffing!

all the grades?

A: He’s in the third grade Sam! You see
under each subject that he is being taught in
school, he receives a mark from one to
three. A one means his achievement or work
is excellent. Here in Science for example he
got a two, which means its satisfactory.

B: What about here in physical education?

A: He got a three here which means it’s
unsatisfactory. We should work on that with
him.

B: So confusing! In my day we got an A or B
if we were doing well and if we failed an
exam we would get an F!

== Global View - The Night Before Christmas (C0337)

It was the night before Christmas, when all
through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a
mouse;
The stockings were hung bythe chimney with
care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be
there;
The children were nestled all snug in their
beds,
111
Englishpod Dialogues
And mama in her ’kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled down for a long winter’s nap,
When out on the lawn there arose such a
clatter, I sprang from the bed to see what
was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash, Tore
open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen
snow
Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below,
When, what to my wondering eyes should
appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny
reindeer,
With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they
came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called
them by name;
” Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer
and Vixen!
On, Comet! on Cupid! on, Donder and
Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the
wall!
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane
fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to
the sky, So up to the house-top the coursers
they flew,
With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas
too.
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof.
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning
around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a
bound.
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to
his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes
and soot;
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler just opening his
pack.
His eyes – how they twinkled! his dimples
how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a
cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a
bow,
Andthe beard of his chin was as white as the
snow;
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his
teeth,
Andthe smoke it encircled his head like a
wreath;
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook, when he laughed like a bowlful
of jelly.
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old
elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of
myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to
dread;
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his
work,
And filled allthe thestockings; then turned
with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, upthe chimney he rose;
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a
whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a
thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of
sight,
” Christmas to all, and to all a good-night.

A: What? Leftovers of what and from when?

B: From last night! I took the left over
turkey, mixed it with some diced peppers and
onions, added a little bit of mayonnaise and
made some sandwiches!

A: Isn’t that dangerous though? I mean
bacteria and germs reproducing on food that
was left out or reheated?

B: Well, I didn’t leave the turkey out at room
temperature for more than an hour and I
refrigerated it soon after we finished eating.

I put it in the oven for fifteen minutes at one
hundred degrees Celsius.

help him with math. I would also recommend
he stay after school twice a week for tutoring
sessions. It will really help a lot.
