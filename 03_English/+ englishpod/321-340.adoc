== The Office ‐ Small Talk 7 ‐ Talking About A Trip (C0325)

Jim: Hey Michelle. Good to see you. Are you
at lunch?

[.my2]
很高兴见到你。你在吃午饭吗？

Michelle: Oh hi Jim. No I just got back. I
thought you were on vacation now.

[.my2]
没有，我刚回来。我以为你现在在度假呢。

Jim: No, I wish I was! I just got back from
Spain actually.

Michelle: Oh wonderful! Have you been
there before or was it your first time?

[.my2]
你以前去过那里吗？还是第一次去？

Jim: My first time. I’ve traveled around
Europe a lot, but this was my first time to
Spain. It was amazing, and the weather was
just beautiful! No rain, and just 只有 sun, sun,
sun....

Michelle: I’m so *jealous 妒忌的 of* you. I’ve never
been anywhere in Europe. I’ve always
dreamed of traveling around and seeing the
sights 风景，名胜；视野.

Jim: Well, I really recommend Spain. You
really should go. Anyway, it’s been great *to
catch up* 叙旧;追赶上, but I must be going, this is my
floor. *Speak again soon* I hope.

[.my2]
这是我的楼层。希望很快再聊。

[.my1]
.案例
====
- "*Speak again soon* I hope" 并不是倒装句。在这里，“I hope”是一个插入语，用来表达说话者的愿望或期待。正常语序也可以表达为 "I hope we can speak again soon." 但日常口语中，人们可能会把这种表达方式稍微调整，使其听起来更加自然或非正式。这种用法更贴近于口语的流畅性和情感的直接表达，而不是语法上的倒装结构。

这里发生了以下变化： +
省略了 "that"： 在正式的英语中，"I hope (that) we..."，但口语中 "that" 经常被省略。 +
语序颠倒： "Speak again soon" 被提前，"I hope" 放在了后面。

虽然它不是严格意义上的语法倒装（如疑问句中的倒装），但它确实改变了正常的语序，以达到特定的表达效果。它是一种口语中常见的表达方式，带有希望的语气。
====

Michelle: For sure. Take care.

[.my2]
当然。保重。

== Global View - The Night Before Christmas (C0337)

It was the night before Christmas, when all
through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a
mouse;
The stockings were hung bythe chimney with
care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be
there;
The children were nestled all snug in their
beds,
111
Englishpod Dialogues
And mama in her ’kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled down for a long winter’s nap,
When out on the lawn there arose such a
clatter, I sprang from the bed to see what
was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash, Tore
open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen
snow
Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below,
When, what to my wondering eyes should
appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny
reindeer,
With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they
came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called
them by name;
” Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer
and Vixen!
On, Comet! on Cupid! on, Donder and
Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the
wall!
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane
fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to
the sky, So up to the house-top the coursers
they flew,
With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas
too.
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof.
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning
around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a
bound.
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to
his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes
and soot;
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler just opening his
pack.
His eyes – how they twinkled! his dimples
how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a
cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a
bow,
Andthe beard of his chin was as white as the
snow;
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his
teeth,
Andthe smoke it encircled his head like a
wreath;
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook, when he laughed like a bowlful
of jelly.
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old
elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of
myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to
dread;
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his
work,
And filled allthe thestockings; then turned
with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, upthe chimney he rose;
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a
whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a
thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of
sight,
” Christmas to all, and to all a good-night.

onions, added a little bit of mayonnaise and

refrigerated it soon after we finished eating.

Also, when reheating,
I put it in the oven for fifteen minutes at one

he stay after school twice a week for tutoring
