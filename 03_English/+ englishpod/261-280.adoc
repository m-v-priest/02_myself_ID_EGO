warm and humid all weekend. In the

[.my2]
恐怕我们要度过一个艰难的周末了，Mark。有一个风暴系统正在东海岸移动。今天一整天都会下毛毛雨，今晚有60%的概率会有雷暴。整个周末都会温暖潮湿。在中西部地区，预计会有强风，最低温度在40华氏度左右。

Saturday.

====
- dreary -> 来自PIE*dhreu, 滴，掉落，词源同drip, drop. 原义为滴血的，引申义沉闷的，阴深的。
====

B: It gets better on Sunday, though 不过，可是，然而. The
storm systems move (v.) east and the skies will
*clear up* 放晴 at night. It will still be rather cool,
with highs 最高温度 in the low 下限附近 50s. The West Coast
will be experiencing some unusually chilly
weather, but at least the sun will come out. I
advise (v.) weekend travelers to be careful,
especially while driving. Back to you, Mark.

[.my2]
不过，周日天气会好转。风暴系统将向东移动，晚上天空会放晴。天气仍然相当凉爽，最高温度在50华氏度出头。西海岸将经历一些异常寒冷的天气，但至少太阳会出来。我建议周末出行的旅行者要小心，尤其是在开车时。Mark，交还给你。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.with highs in the low 50s

这句话描述的是气温情况，*"low" 是指温度在50度*（假设是华氏温度）**的较低范围内。**所以，这句话的意思是最高气温会**维持在50度 Fahrenheit 的下限附近，**即大约在50到54度F之间，天气比较凉爽。

“in the low 50s”: 这里的 s, 并不是指单位，而是指温度的范围。用来表示50到59这个十年代的口语化用法, 在温度表述上的延伸，意为"接近50度, 但略低的几度"，比如51度、52度等，都是50年代（在这个上下文中指的是温度的十年代比喻，并非实际的年代）的低温部分。所以，没有具体的单位，它只是用来形容温度的一个习惯表达。

在 "low 50s" 中的 **"s" 表示的是一个范围，而不是复数。**它表示的是 "50 到 54 之间的温度"。

具体来说： +
*50s: 指的是 50 到 59 之间的温度。* +
*low 50s: 指的是 50 到 54 之间的温度。* +
*high 50s: 指的是 55 到 59 之间的温度。* +
这种用法在描述温度、年龄、年代等数字范围时很常见。

例如： +
"He's in his 30s." (他三十多岁。) +
"The 1990s were a time of great change." (20世纪90年代是一个剧烈变革的时期。)

因此，在您提供的句子中，“low 50s”表示白天的最高温度将在 50 到 54 度之间。


====

A: Thanks John, and *there you have it* 就是这样! Looks
like it’s a weekend to stay at home!

[.my2]
以上就是天气情况！

[.my1]
.案例
====
- "*there you have it*" is used *to conclude or summarize information*. +
就是这样：用于表示某件事情已经被清晰明确地展示、描述或陈述了。

B: Hi I need to transfer some money to
another account. It’s urgent.

A: Okay, have you made a wire transfer at
our bank before ?

B: No. I’ve never made a transfer before.

A: It’s alright, I will take you through the
procedure. Are you transferring funds to a
company or an individual account?

B: A company account. I need to pay a bill.

A: Okay, I’ll need the name of the company
and their bank routing number as well as
their bank’s address and phone number.

B: I have all the information in this folder.

A: Well You’ve come prepared .You have all
the necessary materials so we can go ahead

== The Office ‐ Purchasing Manager (C0268)

A: Good morning, Angela, how have you
been lately?

B: Morning, Michael. I’ve been very busy
lately. One of our other vendors is going out
of business and I’ve been searching for a
suitable replacement.

A: Well, rest assured that you can count on
us to be here for the long run sit down.
Coffee?

B: No, thanks. I’ve been trying to cut down
on the caffeine .

A: Haha, I could never do that. I’d be a
zombie if I didn’t have my morning coffee fix.
Let’s get down to business then.

B: Yes. I’ve come to talk with you about
ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our
new MePhone. The demand for phone
cameras is growing, and Pear has been
falling behind in the market.

A: That’s great! I’m glad to hear that Pear
has finally jumped on the bandwagon. Right
now our contract is for the five megapixel
cameras. Is Pear still interested in having
those?

B: No, we’re changing all the cameras to
eight megapixels. We were hoping that by
making your company our sole supplier for
cameras we could negotiate a better deal.

A: Surely. Let’s get started by drafting a new
contract.

'''

== The Office ‐ Marketing Plan (C0269)

A: Okay everyone, let’s begin. I called you
here today to evaluate our marketing
strategy during this recession. I wanted to
re-emphasize our corporate mission of
Aiming to give our customers the best coffee
and service in a clean and welcoming
atmosphere.

B: Several other shops have reduced the
prices for their coffees and are drawing in
more customers. Why aren’t we doing the
same thing?

A: I know that recent sales have been slow,
but we are not going to reduce our prices to
the level of our competitors. We offer a
superior product and our focus is on longterm
growth rather than shortterm sales. If
we lower our prices, we run the risk of
devaluing our product.

B: Customers don’t care about the coffee
anymore. They only care about the price.

A: I disagree. Highly discerning customers
know that our coffee is far better than the
coffee you buy at the other places. Our
coffee bean are artisan roasted and we use
state-of-the-art equipment to brew our
coffees. When you compare the coffees sideby-
side our coffee wins the taste test every
time. We have never sought to appeal to the
mass market with cheap coffee drinks, and
we will not do so now.

C: That’s true. We’ve certainly achieved top
89
Englishpod Dialogues
of mind awareness when it comes to the best
best tasting brews and it’s important to
distinguish ourselves from our competitors. I
think the main question is how we can show
our appreciation to our customers.

A: That’s the main question I would like to
discuss today.

B: Money is tight for everyone these days so
even our most loyal customers may be
reconsidering the money they pay for their
morning coffee. Since the superiority of our
coffee beans is one of our core competencies
why don’t we sell the beans for people to
brew coffee at home.

C: That could definitely be a way we could
expand our company, but would we be
undermining the essence of the company
that way?

A: Let’s brainstorm some more ideas, and do
some research. The customer always comes
first, and what the customer wants, the
customer gets. Maybe it’s time we started
selling coffee beans.

== Daily Life ‐ Buying A Suit (C0270)

A: Hello sir, what can I do for you today?

years since I visited Beijing ,and it’s clear to
me that operations here are obviously going
from strength to strength.

B: The Alpha brand continues to grow in
leaps and bounds in China, and that is
certainly down to the hard work of all of you
here. So congratulations to all of you.

B: I’d like to start by outlining the key points
of my presentation this afternoon and giving
you an idea of the topics that will be
discussed. The presentation today is divided
into five main parts.

B: First of all, I’d like to briefly touch on the
background of the new x420 line; how the
whole concept has come about and how the
new product fits into our existing brand line.

B: Secondly I’dlike to present data on
projected sales for the x420. We will then go

Grace: You sound exhausted. Maybe you
should hire a nanny to help you out! She can
pick the kids up and take them to their afterschool
activities. She can also help you do
some household chores, and run some
errands.
Mel: Oh, I don’t know... it’s hard to find the
right nanny .You have to consider her
previous work experience, the responsibilities
you give her, and how she interacts with the
kids. I would love to have someone to help
me out, though.
Grace: I think you should definitely consider
it! This way you won’t have to juggle such a
busy schedule, and you’ll still get to spend
time with the kids in the evenings. I can
refer you this great nanny Amy. She used to
work for my neighbors, before they moved
away. She’s very responsible, a good cook,
and great with kids.
Mel: Oh, that’s great. Thanks Grace. Can you
give me her number? I’ll talk it over with Dan

Angela: Hey Lydia, what are you reading?
Lydia: I’m looking at my horoscope for this
month! My outlook is very positive. It says
that I should take a vacation to someplace
exotic, and that I will have a passionate
summer fling!
Angela: What are you talking about? Let me
see that. . . What are horoscopes?
Lydia: It’s a prediction of your month, based
on your zodiac sign . You have a different
sign for the month and date you were born
in. I was born on April 15th, so I’m an Aries.
When were you born?
Angela: January 5th.
Lydia: Let’s see. . . you’re a Capricorn. It
says that you will be feeling stress at work,
but you could see new, exciting
developments in your love life . Looks like
we’ll both have interesting summers!
Angela: That’s bogus. I don’t feel any stress
at work, and my love life is practically
nonexistent. This zodiac stuff is all a bunch
of nonsense.
Lydia: No it’s not, your astrology sign can
tell you a lot about your personality. See? It
says that an Aries is energetic and loves to
socialize. Angela: Well, you certainly match
those criteria, but they’re so broad they
could apply to anyone. What does it say
about me?
Lydia: A Capricorn is serious-minded and
practical. She likes to do things in
conventional ways. * laughs * That sounds
just like you!

== The Office ‐ Presentation Series 2 ‐ Talking about numbers, charts and graphs (C0274)

Mr Ford: As all of you are well aware,
competition in the laptop computer sector is
intense.
Mr Ford: We continue to fight with our
competitors for market share, and this is the
case both in the developed markets in the
West, as well as more developing markets in
Asia and Africa.
Mr Ford: You may ask yourself, why is this
market so cut-throat? Well the answer is
simple. There is a huge untapped potential
market out there, with a huge untapped
potential for profit.
Mr Ford: If I bring up the first graph here, it
shows the increase in terms of number of
computer owners across the globe.
Mr Ford: As you can see in the 1980’s
computer ownership amounted to around
0.5% of the total world population. Since the
1990’s, computer ownership has risen
dramatically.
Mr Ford: In the new millennium we saw an
even larger explosion in computer owners ,
91
Englishpod Dialogues
with figures rising to around 4- 5%, an
increase of 1000 % percent compared with
the 1980’s .
Mr Ford: If we move on to discuss the
figures for China specifically we can see in
Chart B that the overall figure for computer
ownership stands at around 60 million, which
represents a huge increase in a very short
time period.
Mr Ford: Now of course 60 million is just a
drop in the ocean if you compare the total
population of China, and this is a key reason
why the personal computer market is such a
hot market.
Mr Ford: For us at Alpha, and of course for
all our competitors as well, we have millions
of potential customers who are looking to
join the internet generation.
Mr Ford: If we do this right we really can
reap huge rewards in a very short time
frame. I’d now like to move on to discuss the
x420 brand itself, and compare and contrast
with some of our key competitors.

x420 stand out from all the others? This is a
key question, and is something I’d like to
explore in a little depth. Firstly, the x420 has
a range of USPs that really make it a cut
above the rest.
Mr. Ford: The first thing to mention is that
the x420 is the first in a new generation of
ultralight laptop computers. It is only 2lbs,
which compares very favorably with all our
key competitors. In terms of computer
performance, for such a light machine it’s
very powerful. 4Gb of RAM, with an ultra-fast
processor.
Mr. Ford: The most advanced video and
sound cards on the market are installed with
a crystal-clear 15-inch LCD display. The x420
really stands out as next generation laptop.
Compared with our previous x540 range it
really is in a league of its own .
Mr. Ford: Now, if we go on to look at
92
Englishpod Dialogues
projected sales for the x420 we can see that
sales revenue for 2010 is expected to hit at
least 20 million dollars. Now this is really a
conservative estimate.
Mr. Ford: If our marketing campaign is
successful I’m confident that we could see a
doubling of this figure at the very least. Now
please bear in mind that this is only for the
first year of production.
Mr. Ford: I’m certain that in the coming
three years the x420 will actually overtake all
our existing products, both in terms of sales
and revenue. Okay, now let’s move on to
discuss our marketing concept and look more
closely at our key competitors.

== Global View ‐ At The Car Dealership (C0278)

A: Hi there! I am looking for a new car. I

trade in.

B: I see. You are in luck this month because
all of our models are on sale! it is a perfect
time to buy a new car since it’s the end of
the year,

A: Perfect! I like this one.

B: That is the Ford Focus. A very light but
powerful vehicle. It comes with dual side
airbags, power steering and power windows,
tinted windows and your choice of either
automatic or manual transmission.

A: Sounds like a good car! How many miles
to the gallon?

B: It is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you
about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the
highway.

A: That is really convenient. Especially now
that fuel prices are so high! What’s under the
hood?

B: A very powerful 2.5-liter turbocharged
engine, Trust me, this car is fast!

A: Now for the most difficult question. What
is the price tag for this lovely vehicle?

B: Very affordable sir. You can take it out of
this lot today with 0% down payment and no

== The Office ‐ Presentation Series 4 ‐ Discussing the Competition (C0280)

Mr. Ford: Now, of course, with all this
cutting-edge technology there must be a
catch, you might ask yourself. I bet the retail
price will be too much for most consumers,
you might say. Well, you’d be wrong!
Mr. Ford: Yes, of course the x420 is aimed
at the luxury market, but if you compare the
price of our leading competitors, the x420
represents incredible value for money. At
only15,000RMB it is far more affordable and
far more attractive than almost every leading
brand and model.
Mr. Ford: So, what differentiates us from
our competitors? Well, if we compare
Orange’s luxury MP40 range then we can
really highlight some of the differences.
Mr. Ford: Now, of course Orange has an
enviable record for producing revolutionary
93
Englishpod Dialogues
and top class products, and I must admit the
MP40 is a breathtaking machine. However,
for most consumers the MP40 is simply far
too expensive to consider.
Mr. Ford: Compared with the x420 it is more
expensive and there’s no doubt that
considering the quality and workmanship
that goes into the x420 we really win hands
down on value for money.
Mr. Ford: Also, if you compare the after
sales service we offer I think we can proudly
boast the best customer service facilities in
the whole lap-top sector. As opposed to most
of our rivals, we guarantee quality, we
guarantee service and we guarantee
reliability.
Mr. Ford: The questions we must ask
ourselves are ” What does the Alpha brand
stand for? and also ” How can we set
ourselves apart from our competitors? The
answer to both of these questions is the
same my friends.
Mr. Ford: Alpha stands first and foremost for
quality, for excellence and for service. If we
always stick to this philosophy then I’m
confident that we will really be able to
expand our market share significantly. Okay,
let me move on now to give you an idea of
our marketing campaign for the x420
