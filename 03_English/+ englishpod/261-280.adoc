== Daily Life ‐ Describing Someone’s Face (C0261)

A: Let’s play a game!

B: Ok! How about Scrabble?

A: No no, a friend of mine taught me this
really fun game. I’m going to describe
someone’s face, and you guess who it is!

B: Ok!

A: Let’s see. He has a roman nose, bushy
eyebrows and dimples!

B: Our cousin Pete! My turn! She has a
pointy nose, sunken eyes and a mole on her
chin!

A: Aunt Rose! That mole is so huge! Ok, my
turn. He has a crooked nose and full lips. He
has quite a few freckles and an oval face.
Oh, he is also bald!

B: Your future husband!

A: Not funny.

== The Office ‐ Interview Skills 10 ‐ Concluding The Interview (C0262)
Mr. Parsons: Well Rebecca, is there
anything else you need to know for now?
Rebecca: I don’t think so Mr. Parsons. I
think you have covered all the main points
for me.
Mr Parsons: Okay well listen, here is my
business card with my mobile number. If any
other questions spring to mind don’t hesitate
to contact me. Of course you can also call
Miss Childs too.
Rebecca: Great. Ermm, when can I expect
to hear from you?
Mr. Parsons: Well, we are finishing the
shortlist interviews tomorrow, so we will
certainly have a decision made by early next
week. Miss Childs will call you to discuss
more on Monday or Tuesday. How does that
sound?
Rebecca: That sounds perfect. Thank you
very much for taking the time to speak to me
Mr. Parsons.
Mr. Parsons: The pleasure’s all mine
Rebecca.
Rebecca: I hope to hear from you very
soon.
Mr. Parsons: Absolutely. Thanks for coming
Rebecca. Goodbye.

== Global View ‐ Nationalities (C0263)

A: Hey! How was your first day of class? I’m
in level two and I’m loving my class this
semester! It’s great being in a class of
international students!

B: Mine was ok, except that no one in my
class speaks English. I guess it will force me
to converse in Chinese more in class so at
least I should improve a lot this semester.

A: That’s both fortunate and unfortunate. It’s
the United Nations in my class! We have
people from all over the world! There are
three Germans, a Pole, a Scottish, two
French, an American, a Brazilian, a Chilean, a
New Zealander, though he prefers to call
himself a Kiwi. Who else do we have? Oh, we
also have a Moroccan, a Togolese, a
87
Englishpod Dialogues
Pakistani, and two Indonesians!

B: That’s quite the array of nationalities.
Everyone in my class is from Asia, except
me. There are a few South Koreans, several
Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean,
Filipino, Kazakhstani, and one Russian.

A: Well, I think you’re pretty lucky actually.
You’ll have the opportunity to learn so much
about Asian culture.

B: I guess so, but I think it’s going to be
hard to relate to my classmates, especially
with the language barrier. I think I might
change classes.

A: Don’t! Stay the course! Your spoken
Chinese will be eternally grateful. I bet you it
will even surpass mine with all that practice.

B: I highly doubt it. Your girlfriend is
Chinese.

A: Well, there is that, yes.

'''

== Daily Life ‐ Toothache (C0264)

A: What seems to be the problem?

B: I have a really bad toothache! My cheek is
swollen and I can’t eat anything.

A: Let’s have a look. Hmmm. This doesn’t
look too good. I think we may have to pull
out your wisdom tooth. It’s pressing against
your molars and that’s one of the reasons
you are experiencing so much pain.

B: When you pull my tooth will you also have
to extract the nerve and the root?

A: First we will take some x-rays and see
what we’re dealing with. I also noticed a
small cavity up front here, so you are going
to need a filling.

B: I guess that’s what I get for not flossing
or brushing my teeth three times a day.

A: It could be that, or maybe you are eating
too many sweets. In any case, I’ll administer
an anesthetic and you won’t feel a thing!

'''

== The Weekend ‐ Pest Control (C0265)

A: Hi, did you call for an exterminator?

B: Yes! Thank goodness you’re here. These
bugs are driving us crazy!

A: What sort of pest are we dealing with?

B: We just bought this house and it is
infected with just about everything. We have
termites in the wood, cockroaches all over
the place, and last night I saw a huge rat out
in the backyard!

A: Well, there’s nothing we can’t handle. I’ll
spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of
the cockroaches, but the termites will be
harder to get rid of. We will have to cover the
entire house and fumigate it. Unfortunately
that means you will have to find a place to
stay for the next three days.

B: No problem, just get rid of the bugs!

'''

== Daily Life ‐ Weather Report (C0266)

A: Those are today’s top stories. Now let’s go
to John for the weather. John, what does the
forecast look like for our weekend travelers?

B: I’m afraid we’re in for a rough weekend,
Mark. There is a storm system moving
through the East Coast. It will be drizzling all
day today, and there’s a 60 percent chance
of thunderstorms this evening. It will be
warm and humid all weekend. In the
Midwest, expect strong winds and a low of
around 40 degrees.

A: That’s pretty chilly for the summer! Will it
rain on Saturday?

B: Unfortunately, yes. It will be clear early
Saturday morning but there is a high chance
of showers and thunderstorms later in the
day. There is a severe thunderstorm warning
for some parts of the Southeast. Folks in
those areas might see some hail and
flooding, especially in areas that have been
experiencing record high rainfalls.

A: That certainly sounds like a dreary
Saturday.

B: It gets better on Sunday, though. The
storm systems move east and the skies will
clear up at night. It will still be rather cool,
with highs in the low 50s. The West Coast
will be experiencing some unusually chilly
weather, but at least the sun will come out. I
advise weekend travelers to be careful,
especially while driving. Back to you, Mark.

A: Thanks John, and there you have it! Looks
88
Englishpod Dialogues
like it’s a weekend to stay at home!

== Daily Life ‐ Making A Bank Transfer (C0267)

A: Good Morning welcome to Bank of the
USA. How may I help you today?

B: Hi I need to transfer some money to
another account. It’s urgent.

A: Okay, have you made a wire transfer at
our bank before ?

B: No. I’ve never made a transfer before.

A: It’s alright, I will take you through the
procedure. Are you transferring funds to a
company or an individual account?

B: A company account. I need to pay a bill.

A: Okay, I’ll need the name of the company
and their bank routing number as well as
their bank’s address and phone number.

B: I have all the information in this folder.

A: Well You’ve come prepared .You have all
the necessary materials so we can go ahead
and make the transfer right now. It’s a
simple transaction, and we can process it
today.

B: Oh, that’s such a relief. I didn’t want the
payment to be overdue. Thank you so much .

A: It’s my pleasure.

'''

== The Office ‐ Purchasing Manager (C0268)

A: Good morning, Angela, how have you
been lately?

B: Morning, Michael. I’ve been very busy
lately. One of our other vendors is going out
of business and I’ve been searching for a
suitable replacement.

A: Well, rest assured that you can count on
us to be here for the long run sit down.
Coffee?

B: No, thanks. I’ve been trying to cut down
on the caffeine .

A: Haha, I could never do that. I’d be a
zombie if I didn’t have my morning coffee fix.
Let’s get down to business then.

B: Yes. I’ve come to talk with you about
ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our
new MePhone. The demand for phone
cameras is growing, and Pear has been
falling behind in the market.

A: That’s great! I’m glad to hear that Pear
has finally jumped on the bandwagon. Right
now our contract is for the five megapixel
cameras. Is Pear still interested in having
those?

B: No, we’re changing all the cameras to
eight megapixels. We were hoping that by
making your company our sole supplier for
cameras we could negotiate a better deal.

A: Surely. Let’s get started by drafting a new
contract.

'''

== The Office ‐ Marketing Plan (C0269)

A: Okay everyone, let’s begin. I called you
here today to evaluate our marketing
strategy during this recession. I wanted to
re-emphasize our corporate mission of
Aiming to give our customers the best coffee
and service in a clean and welcoming
atmosphere.

B: Several other shops have reduced the
prices for their coffees and are drawing in
more customers. Why aren’t we doing the
same thing?

A: I know that recent sales have been slow,
but we are not going to reduce our prices to
the level of our competitors. We offer a
superior product and our focus is on longterm
growth rather than shortterm sales. If
we lower our prices, we run the risk of
devaluing our product.

B: Customers don’t care about the coffee
anymore. They only care about the price.

A: I disagree. Highly discerning customers
know that our coffee is far better than the
coffee you buy at the other places. Our
coffee bean are artisan roasted and we use
state-of-the-art equipment to brew our
coffees. When you compare the coffees sideby-
side our coffee wins the taste test every
time. We have never sought to appeal to the
mass market with cheap coffee drinks, and
we will not do so now.

C: That’s true. We’ve certainly achieved top
89
Englishpod Dialogues
of mind awareness when it comes to the best
best tasting brews and it’s important to
distinguish ourselves from our competitors. I
think the main question is how we can show
our appreciation to our customers.

A: That’s the main question I would like to
discuss today.

B: Money is tight for everyone these days so
even our most loyal customers may be
reconsidering the money they pay for their
morning coffee. Since the superiority of our
coffee beans is one of our core competencies
why don’t we sell the beans for people to
brew coffee at home.

C: That could definitely be a way we could
expand our company, but would we be
undermining the essence of the company
that way?

A: Let’s brainstorm some more ideas, and do
some research. The customer always comes
first, and what the customer wants, the
customer gets. Maybe it’s time we started
selling coffee beans.

'''

== Daily Life ‐ Buying A Suit (C0270)

A: Hello sir, what can I do for you today?

B: Hi, I need a new suit. I have an important
interview next week, so I really need to look
sharp.

A: No problem! We have a broad selection of
suits, all tailored made so that it will fit
perfectly.

B: Great! I want a three piece suit,
preferably made from Italian cashmere or
wool.

A: Very well sir. Would you like to have some
shirts made also?

B: Sure. I’ll also take some silver cuff link
and a pair of silk ties.

A: Very good. Now, if you will accompany
me, we can take your measurements and
choose the patterns for your suit and shirts.

== The Office ‐ Presentation Series 1 ‐ The Overview and the Agenda (C0271)

A: Hi everyone, Can everyone hear me?Can
you guys at the back hear everything?

A: Okay great. Well I think all of you know
why we are here this afternoon. As most of
you are aware 2010 marks an important
moment for Alpha computers.

A: We have bounced back from the recession
and now we are set to launch our new line of
laptop and desktop computers.

A: I’m really pleased to welcome Michael
Ford, the Global Marketing Manager for Alpha
computers, who has flown in from California
to give all of you an overview of the
marketing campaign and to answer any
questions you may have. So please give a
warm welcome to Mr. Ford.

B: Thank you Jonathan. It really is a
pleasure to be here today. It has been three
years since I visited Beijing ,and it’s clear to
me that operations here are obviously going
from strength to strength.

B: The Alpha brand continues to grow in
leaps and bounds in China, and that is
certainly down to the hard work of all of you
here. So congratulations to all of you.

B: I’d like to start by outlining the key points
of my presentation this afternoon and giving
you an idea of the topics that will be
discussed. The presentation today is divided
into five main parts.

B: First of all, I’d like to briefly touch on the
background of the new x420 line; how the
whole concept has come about and how the
new product fits into our existing brand line.

B: Secondly I’dlike to present data on
projected sales for the x420. We will then go
on to discuss our key rivals in this sector.
Then I would like to go on to outline the
campaign concept for the x420.

B: Finally I’m happy to open up the
discussion for any questions or points you
might have for me.

== Daily Life ‐ Getting A Nanny (C0272)
Grace: Hey Mel! Are you up for some tennis
today?
Mel: Sorry, I can’t! I have to go to work, pick
up Jake and Maddie from school, and make
them an afternoon snack, then take Jake to
90
Englishpod Dialogues
soccer practice and Maddie to dance class.
Grace: You sound exhausted. Maybe you
should hire a nanny to help you out! She can
pick the kids up and take them to their afterschool
activities. She can also help you do
some household chores, and run some
errands.
Mel: Oh, I don’t know... it’s hard to find the
right nanny .You have to consider her
previous work experience, the responsibilities
you give her, and how she interacts with the
kids. I would love to have someone to help
me out, though.
Grace: I think you should definitely consider
it! This way you won’t have to juggle such a
busy schedule, and you’ll still get to spend
time with the kids in the evenings. I can
refer you this great nanny Amy. She used to
work for my neighbors, before they moved
away. She’s very responsible, a good cook,
and great with kids.
Mel: Oh, that’s great. Thanks Grace. Can you
give me her number? I’ll talk it over with Dan
and give her a call tomorrow. Maybe this way
I won’t be so tired every day, and Dan and I
might even get to go on a date once in a
while .

== The Weekend ‐ The Zodiac and Horoscopes (C0273)

Angela: Hey Lydia, what are you reading?
Lydia: I’m looking at my horoscope for this
month! My outlook is very positive. It says
that I should take a vacation to someplace
exotic, and that I will have a passionate
summer fling!
Angela: What are you talking about? Let me
see that. . . What are horoscopes?
Lydia: It’s a prediction of your month, based
on your zodiac sign . You have a different
sign for the month and date you were born
in. I was born on April 15th, so I’m an Aries.
When were you born?
Angela: January 5th.
Lydia: Let’s see. . . you’re a Capricorn. It
says that you will be feeling stress at work,
but you could see new, exciting
developments in your love life . Looks like
we’ll both have interesting summers!
Angela: That’s bogus. I don’t feel any stress
at work, and my love life is practically
nonexistent. This zodiac stuff is all a bunch
of nonsense.
Lydia: No it’s not, your astrology sign can
tell you a lot about your personality. See? It
says that an Aries is energetic and loves to
socialize. Angela: Well, you certainly match
those criteria, but they’re so broad they
could apply to anyone. What does it say
about me?
Lydia: A Capricorn is serious-minded and
practical. She likes to do things in
conventional ways. * laughs * That sounds
just like you!

== The Office ‐ Presentation Series 2 ‐ Talking about numbers, charts and graphs (C0274)

Mr Ford: As all of you are well aware,
competition in the laptop computer sector is
intense.
Mr Ford: We continue to fight with our
competitors for market share, and this is the
case both in the developed markets in the
West, as well as more developing markets in
Asia and Africa.
Mr Ford: You may ask yourself, why is this
market so cut-throat? Well the answer is
simple. There is a huge untapped potential
market out there, with a huge untapped
potential for profit.
Mr Ford: If I bring up the first graph here, it
shows the increase in terms of number of
computer owners across the globe.
Mr Ford: As you can see in the 1980’s
computer ownership amounted to around
0.5% of the total world population. Since the
1990’s, computer ownership has risen
dramatically.
Mr Ford: In the new millennium we saw an
even larger explosion in computer owners ,
91
Englishpod Dialogues
with figures rising to around 4- 5%, an
increase of 1000 % percent compared with
the 1980’s .
Mr Ford: If we move on to discuss the
figures for China specifically we can see in
Chart B that the overall figure for computer
ownership stands at around 60 million, which
represents a huge increase in a very short
time period.
Mr Ford: Now of course 60 million is just a
drop in the ocean if you compare the total
population of China, and this is a key reason
why the personal computer market is such a
hot market.
Mr Ford: For us at Alpha, and of course for
all our competitors as well, we have millions
of potential customers who are looking to
join the internet generation.
Mr Ford: If we do this right we really can
reap huge rewards in a very short time
frame. I’d now like to move on to discuss the
x420 brand itself, and compare and contrast
with some of our key competitors.

== Daily Life ‐ Kitchen Appliances (C0275)

A: I have been looking at this online catalog
for over an hour and I still haven’t finished
getting all the kitchen appliances that we
need!

B: What are you getting?

A: Well, the first thing on my list is a new
blender. I decided to also get a juicer and a
new coffee maker.

B: Don’t forget to also get a new mixer. I
lent the old one to my brother and he broke
it.

A: Yeah I know. I also decided to throw away
the old toaster and get a new one. I am also
getting a rice cooker and steamer to make
some nice steamed fish or veggies.

B: I’m actually thinking of completely
refurnishing the kitchen and getting a new
stove, oven, dishwasher and trash
compacter.

A: That’s a good idea ! The kitchen will look
amazing!

'''

== Daily Life ‐ Telephone Services (C0276)

A: Telco Mobile, how can I help you?

B: Yes, I’d like to activate my voice mail
service please.

A: Certainly sir, we currently have a special
promotion where we include voice mail
services, call waiting and also three way
calling.

B: Sure that sounds great! Are there any
other fees?

A: Not at all. No hidden fees or surcharges, it
is a flat monthly rate.

B: Perfect. I also wanted to know if there is
any call forwarding service? I am usually out
of town and would like my calls to be
forwarded to a local number.

A: Yes of course. We can activate all these
services in about an hour.

'''

== The Office ‐ Presentation Series 3 ‐ Maki
ng Comparisons (C0277)
Mr. Ford: Now a key question you might ask
yourself is what differentiates the new x420
line with our previous models, and also of
course with some of our competitors.
Mr. Ford: In other words what makes the
x420 stand out from all the others? This is a
key question, and is something I’d like to
explore in a little depth. Firstly, the x420 has
a range of USPs that really make it a cut
above the rest.
Mr. Ford: The first thing to mention is that
the x420 is the first in a new generation of
ultralight laptop computers. It is only 2lbs,
which compares very favorably with all our
key competitors. In terms of computer
performance, for such a light machine it’s
very powerful. 4Gb of RAM, with an ultra-fast
processor.
Mr. Ford: The most advanced video and
sound cards on the market are installed with
a crystal-clear 15-inch LCD display. The x420
really stands out as next generation laptop.
Compared with our previous x540 range it
really is in a league of its own .
Mr. Ford: Now, if we go on to look at
92
Englishpod Dialogues
projected sales for the x420 we can see that
sales revenue for 2010 is expected to hit at
least 20 million dollars. Now this is really a
conservative estimate.
Mr. Ford: If our marketing campaign is
successful I’m confident that we could see a
doubling of this figure at the very least. Now
please bear in mind that this is only for the
first year of production.
Mr. Ford: I’m certain that in the coming
three years the x420 will actually overtake all
our existing products, both in terms of sales
and revenue. Okay, now let’s move on to
discuss our marketing concept and look more
closely at our key competitors.

== Global View ‐ At The Car Dealership (C0278)

A: Hi there! I am looking for a new car. I
have this old Ford Pinto that I would like to
trade in.

B: I see. You are in luck this month because
all of our models are on sale! it is a perfect
time to buy a new car since it’s the end of
the year,

A: Perfect! I like this one.

B: That is the Ford Focus. A very light but
powerful vehicle. It comes with dual side
airbags, power steering and power windows,
tinted windows and your choice of either
automatic or manual transmission.

A: Sounds like a good car! How many miles
to the gallon?

B: It is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you
about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the
highway.

A: That is really convenient. Especially now
that fuel prices are so high! What’s under the
hood?

B: A very powerful 2.5-liter turbocharged
engine, Trust me, this car is fast!

A: Now for the most difficult question. What
is the price tag for this lovely vehicle?

B: Very affordable sir. You can take it out of
this lot today with 0% down payment and no
interest for the first year! You can test drive
it now and we can sign the papers when we
get back.

A: Great! Let’s do it!

== Global View ‐ Drugs (C0279)

A: Hey man, you wanna buy some weed?

B: Some what?

A: Weed! You know? Pot, Ganja, Mary Jane
some chronic!

B: Oh, umm, no thanks.

A: I also have blow if you prefer to do a few
lines.

B: No, I am ok, really.

A: Come on man! I even got dope and acid!
Try some!

B: Do you really have all of these drugs?
Where do you get them from?

A: I got my connections! Just tell me what
you want and I’ll even give you one ounce
for free.

B: Sounds good! Let’s see, I want.

A: Yeah?

B: I want you to put your hands behind your
head! You are under arrest!

'''

== The Office ‐ Presentation Series 4 ‐ Discussing the Competition (C0280)

Mr. Ford: Now, of course, with all this
cutting-edge technology there must be a
catch, you might ask yourself. I bet the retail
price will be too much for most consumers,
you might say. Well, you’d be wrong!
Mr. Ford: Yes, of course the x420 is aimed
at the luxury market, but if you compare the
price of our leading competitors, the x420
represents incredible value for money. At
only15,000RMB it is far more affordable and
far more attractive than almost every leading
brand and model.
Mr. Ford: So, what differentiates us from
our competitors? Well, if we compare
Orange’s luxury MP40 range then we can
really highlight some of the differences.
Mr. Ford: Now, of course Orange has an
enviable record for producing revolutionary
93
Englishpod Dialogues
and top class products, and I must admit the
MP40 is a breathtaking machine. However,
for most consumers the MP40 is simply far
too expensive to consider.
Mr. Ford: Compared with the x420 it is more
expensive and there’s no doubt that
considering the quality and workmanship
that goes into the x420 we really win hands
down on value for money.
Mr. Ford: Also, if you compare the after
sales service we offer I think we can proudly
boast the best customer service facilities in
the whole lap-top sector. As opposed to most
of our rivals, we guarantee quality, we
guarantee service and we guarantee
reliability.
Mr. Ford: The questions we must ask
ourselves are ” What does the Alpha brand
stand for? and also ” How can we set
ourselves apart from our competitors? The
answer to both of these questions is the
same my friends.
Mr. Ford: Alpha stands first and foremost for
quality, for excellence and for service. If we
always stick to this philosophy then I’m
confident that we will really be able to
expand our market share significantly. Okay,
let me move on now to give you an idea of
our marketing campaign for the x420
