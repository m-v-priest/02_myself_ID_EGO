someone to look after drafting our plan;
Ralph, I’d like you to head up this project.

C: Sure, no problem. What issues do you
want me to consider?

B: Well, let’s see, there are a few points we
need to be thinking about. . . first, I’ll need
you to analyze our numbers and figure out
what kind of financial impact an outbreak
might have.

A: You’ll also need to think about how we can
avoid any of our employees getting infected;
think of ways to reduce employee-customer
contact, perhaps some IT solutions that will
allow our people to work from home.

C: I guess you’ll need me to forecast
employee absences as well, right? And I’ll
think about the impact this will have on our
clients. Hey, what about vaccines? Should we
be thinking about getting vaccines for our
employees?

A: Exactly right. So, I’ll leave this to you,
and we’ll review the draft plan in two weeks.

== 029. Elementary ‐Advanced ‐ Investing in Emerging Markets (E0029)

A: Dad, I’d like to borrow some money.

B: Sure, Johnny, how much do you need?
Five bucks?

A: Come on, Dad, I need thirty thousand. I
wanna get into the market. You know, I’m
tired of hearing all this news about the
economic downturn, the inevitable recession,
people stuffing their money in their
mattresses. I look at this as an opportunity.
This is a chance for me to get a jump start
on building my nest egg.

B: I don’t know about that; with all the
uncertainty in the markets right now, it
would be a very unwise decision to invest. I
don’t know if you’re aware son, but there has
been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently.
There have already been half a million layoffs
in the last few months, and we have no idea
how the proposed stimulus package will
impact the economy. There’s just too much
instability. I wouldn’t feel comfortable
investing in this climate.

A: But look at it this way, every challenge is
an opportunity. And anyway, I’m not talking
about investing in the domestic market.
There are emerging markets that promise
great returns. Look at China, for example;
they have 1.4 billion people, half a billion of
whom have recently entered the middle
class. Here alone, the aggregate demand for
consumer goods rePresents an amazing
wealth generating opportunity.

B: Come on, son, you’re looking at this too
naively, the Chinese market has exhibited a
great deal of instability, and their currency
has been devalued by almost a whole
percentage point.

A: Fine, then! If that’s the way you feel, so
be it. But you’re losing out on a great
opportunity here. I’m going to go hit up Mum
for the cash.

reason...
