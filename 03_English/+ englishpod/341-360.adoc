== Daily Life - Baking A Cake (C0341)

A: Ok, so are you ready to learn how to bake
a cake?

B: Almost, let me just put my apron on.

A: Ok, so the first thing we are going to do is
preheat the oven, that way we have it at the
desired temperature once we finish preparing
everything.
Set it to three hundred and seventy five
degrees
Fahrenheit.

B: Got it.

A: No we are gonna make the batter. Take
some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until
you have a nice consistency. Then add some
vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing.

B: Do I have to use a whisk or can I use the
electric mixer?

A: Go ahead and use the mixer, but put it on
medium speed. I’m gonna sift the flour and
baking powder separately and then we can
mix it with milk and the rest of the
ingredients.

B: Ok, so now we need a baking pan right?

A: Yeah, but grease and flour it first so the
cake won’t stick to it when it bakes.

B: Done. So how long do we bake it for?

A: We can leave it in there for about twenty
five minutes.
Then we let it cool for ten minutes before we
remove the cake from the pan.

B: Wow! This was a lot easier than I thought!

A: That’s cool, does your personal trainer
basically teach you how to work out?

B: Yeah. He makes a work put plan
depending on the areas I want to work on, or
the muscles I want to build. Like for example
in order to get better muscle tone in my abs,
pecs and biceps, he makes me work out with
free weights. Then for my quads, calves and
hamstrings, I do leg lifts or squats.

A: Sounds like you are really getting in

== Global View - All About Wines (C0346)

Salesperson: Hello there, welcome to
WineWorld. Let me know if I can help you
out at all.
Customer: Um, yes, please, I could really
use some help. I’m going over to my boss’
house for dinner tonight and don’t know
what kind of wine I should bring.
Salesperson: OK, do you know what kind of
food will be served?
Customer: Well, his wife is Japanese. He said
she makes really good sushi.
Salesperson: Hmm, that’s a bit of a
challenge. Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair
with wine.
Well, let’s see. have to be a white wine, of
course.
Customer: Why? Wouldn’t a red wine go well
with sushi?
Salesperson: No, I don’t think so. Sushi is a
very delicately flavored food, and red wine
would be a jarring contrast. You need a white
wine, which has more subtle flavors, to
complement the fish.
Customer: I see. So should I get a bottle of
Chardonnay? That’s a white wine, right?
Salesperson: Yes, Chardonnay is a white
wine, but
I’m not sure it’d be your best bet.
Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied
whites, and tends to be a bit oaky. I’d
suggest that you go for something
brighter, like this Sauvignon Blanc from New
Zealand.
Customer: Sauvignon Blanc? What’s that?
Salesperson: That’s another varietal, or type
of grape, just like Chardonnay.
Customer: Let’s see. The label says it’s got
”attractive citrus and grassy aromas that
give way to crisp, mineral flavors and a
bonedry finish. Serve chilled.” Oh, no, how
long will it take to chill the wine? I’m on my
way to the dinner now.
Salesperson: It’s OK, don’t worry, we’ll just
choose a wine from the cooler. We don’t have
quite as extensive a selection over here,
but...this Rhone Valley white would be lovely.
Customer: All right. What varietal is that?
Salesperson: Well, this is a French wine, so
they don’t always specify the varietal on the
label.
The French believe that the soil a grape is
grown in is one of the most important factors
in the final flavor of the wine.
This wine is probably a blend of a few
different types of grapes, mostly Viognier,
I’d guess.
Customer: And you think this is a good wine?
Salesperson: Yes, this is one of our bestsellers.
It’s not quite as dry as the Sauvignon
Blanc we were looking at earlier, which
means it’s more approachable. It’s light and
crisp, with a bit of a vanilla aroma.
Customer: Perfect! I’ll take it!

== The Weekend - Talking About Skincare (C0348)

A: You want to go get a facial with me today?

B: Dude, what are you talking about? Only
girls do that.

A: Not at all, guys also get facials, manicures
and pedicures. There is nothing wrong with
looking after your skin and looking good.

B: True. So what do they do to you at your
beauty spa?

A: Well, first they exfoliate my face, getting
rid of all the dead skin. Then I get a face
mask with nutrients that keep my skin
healthy and young. Afterwards, they apply
some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a
million bucks.

B: That doesn’t really sound like something I
would be interested in. In any case, I just
wash my face every night and use sunscreen
during the day.

A: Well you should come with me one day,
I’m sure you’ll love it.

B: Uh... no.


'''

== Global View - Chinese Medicine (C0349)

A: What’s wrong?

B: I have a headache. These past few days
I’ve been living off painkillers. Man, I feel like
my head is going to explode.

A: You should get acupuncture treatment. My
mom was always having headache issues
and it was acupuncture that cured her.

B: The results are too slow. On top of that,
just the thought of smoking needles poking
into my flesh frightens me.

A: They don’t just randomly stick you, they
find your pressure points. The heat allows
the body to immediately respond to the
treatment, restoring the body’s ”chi”.

B: But I get scared the moment I see a
needle. How could I stand having needles in
my body for hours on end?

A: The needles are very thin, and as long as
the doctor’s technique is good, and the
patient himself is relaxed, it won’t hurt–on
the contrary it will actually alleviate pain.
Now there are high-tech
needles that are micro thin; they don’t hurt
at all.
However, if you are really scared of
acupuncture, scraping or cupping are also
options.

B: Scraping is too terrifying. When they
finish scrapping, your body is all red, as if
you were just tortured.
Cupping is the same, your body ends up with
red circles all over it–looks like someone beat
you up.

A: This only signifies that the toxins have left
the body. Actually, there is only discomfort
during the treatment process. Once it’s over
you feel very comfortable.

B: Chinese medicine is strange. The patients
are already
ill, and then the doctor makes them suffer
more.

A: This is the only way to get at the problem.
Anyway, if you want to relieve the pain, You
are just going to have to be tough and do it.

B: Forget it. I don’t want to inflict any more
pain on myself. In a little while I’ll go and
buy some more painkillers and take a nap.

A: What are you doing this weekend?

B: A bit of both. Some cousins, aunts and
uncles will be there, but also some friends
from the neighborhood.

A: Is your great uncle Rick going to be
there? He is really funny.

B: Yeah he is going to be there with his stepson

Hepatitis B shots. He is 14 months old, so he

Measles shots.

B: What about Rubella and Mumps?

A: Well, I can only give him these for now,
and after a couple of weeks I can administer
the rest.

B: Ok great. Doctor, I think I also may need
a
Tetanus booster. Last time I got it was
maybe fifteen years ago!

A: We will check our records and I’ll have the
nurse administer the booster as well. Now,
please hold
Ricky’s arm tight, this may sting a little.

new seven wonders of the world and people
could vote for them online.

B: Wow, that’s really interesting. So who
won?

A: Well, the Great Wall of China, the Taj

in Jordan,
Machu Picchu in Peru and the pyramid in
Chichenitza in Mexico.

year.

how’ve you been?
Settling into college life OK?

A: Yeah, I think so! I pledged Phi Iota Alpha,
so I’m living at the frat house now.

B: Oh, so you’re a frat boy now, huh?

A: Yeah, yeah, I know, it’s totally clich ´ e,
but really, I think it’s been a good decision.
I’ve got a lot of support and good
suggestions from the guys.
What about you? What have you been up to?

B: Not much. I’m still living at home and
commuting to school. I ended up dropping
that metalworking class I was so excited
about. It just wasn’t as interesting as I’d
hoped. The guidance counselor suggested
that I focus on my prerequisite courses so
that I can make sure the credits count.

A: That sounds smart. . . but kind of boring.

B: Yeah, it is, a little bit. I joined the Great
Outdoors
Club, though, which has been a lot of fun.
We’ve gone on two camping trips already,
and I’ve made some good friends.

A: That’s cool. Hey, so have you decided on
your major yet?

B: Definitely pre-med. What about you?

A: I still have no clue. . . but we don’t have

Oops, I’m late for class. Gotta run!

== Global View - Homeschooling (C0354)

A: I think we should home school our
children when we decide to have kids.

B: What? Why?

A: Well, our public schools here are not very
good and private school are just too
expensive. I have been reading up on home
schooling and it has a lot of advantages.

B: Like what? I think that by doing
something like that we would be isolating our
children from social interaction.

A: Well, first of all, I would be able to teach
them everything they learn in school in a
more relaxed and fun way. I also think that
having a one-on-one class is much better

strengths or weaknesses.

B: I think neither your parents or mine would
agree to such an idea.

A: I will bring it up over Sunday brunch.

chickens which are super grown in order to
