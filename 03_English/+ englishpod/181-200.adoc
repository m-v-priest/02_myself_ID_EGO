our presents! Can we go open them? Please!
Please!

A: What do you think of this one?

B: Eh, so so.

A: And this one? Too flashy?

B: Nah, not too flashy.

A: Uhg! And this sweater from my aunt?
Isn’t it hideous?

B: I guess.

A: Are you even listening? I’m trying to have
a conversation with you.

you’re yapping on about your new clothes!

A: Well I have to decide which gifts to keep
and which to exchange for better ones when
I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon!

B: Well could you do me the favor of making
this quick? It’s the third quarter and you’ve
been blabbering on since the first!

A: Oh, your precious game. You watch the
same game every year, and each year your
beloved hometown team loses by at least
three goals!

B: Oh no you didn’t. You didn’t just insult the
Salsbury Seals, did you? Why don’t you just.
just go and return all of those stupid clothes
and not come back until the sales are over?

A: I might just! Enjoy your stupid game!

B: And Merry Christmas!

A: Merry Christmas!

== Elementary ‐Daily Life ‐ Fresh Start (C0184)

A: Now that it’s the new year, I’ve decided to
turn over a new leaf.

B: Yeah? You finally decided to wipe the slate
clean?

A: You got it! I have a new job, I’m living in
a new city, with new friends! This is my
opportunity to make some small changes in
the way I live my life.

B: So what are you going to do? Take up an
art class or something?

A: Well, first of all, I’ve decided to stop
smoking. It’s not that I’m pinching pennies
or anything, it’s just that I’ve been smoking
since I was sixteen, and I think it’s time to
stop.

B: I’m with you on that one. Anything else
you’re planning on doing?

A: One last thing, I’ve decided to come out
of the closet.

B: It’s about time!

'''


== Elementary ‐The Weekend ‐ Farm Animals (C0185)

A: Isn’t this great? I always wanted to own a
farm, live out in the country, grow my own
food!

B: This is very beautiful. Though I have to
confess, I don’t know the first thing about
farming!

A: That’s fine! Don’t worry about it!

B: What was that?

A: Relax, it was just a goat!

B: And that?

A: It’s just the cows that are grazing over
there. We can milk them later.

B: What was that?

A: Honey, seriously, It’s just a sheep. Relax!

A: Relax, that was just the horses and
donkeys that are in the stable .

B: You know what? I don’t think I can hack it
here out in the countryside. I’m going back
to the city!

'''


== Elementary ‐The Office ‐ Business Plan (C0186)

A: I’ve had it! I’m done working for a
company that is taking me nowhere!

B: So what are you gonna do? Just quit?

A: That’s exactly what I am going to do! I’ve
decided to create my own company! I’m
going to write up a business plan, get some
investors and start working for myself!

B: Have you ever written up a business plan
before?

A: Well, it can’t be that hard! I mean, all you
have to do is explain your business, how you
are going to do things and that’s it, right?

B: You couldn’t be more wrong! A well
written business plan will include an
executive summary which highlights the idea
of the business in two pages or less. Then
you need to describe your company with
information such as what type of legal
structure it has, history, etc.

A: Well that seems easy enough.

B: Wait, there’s more! Then you need to
introduce and describe your goods or
services. What they are and how they are
different from competitors’? Then comes the
hard part, a market analysis. You need to
investigate and analyze hundreds of
variables! You need to take into consideration
socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to
how many children on average the
population has! All this information is useful
so that you can move on to your strategy
and implementation stage, where you will
describe in detail how you will actually
execute your idea.

A: Geez. Is that all?

B: Almost, the most important piece of
information for your investors will be the
financial analysis. Here you will calculate and
estimate sales, cash flow and profits. After
all, people will want to know when they will
begin to see a return on their investment!

A: Umm. I think I’ll just stick to my old job

and save myself all the hassle of trying to
start up a business!

== Elementary ‐Daily Life ‐ Going On A Diet (C0187)

A: Oh man! I’ve been starving myself for
days now and I haven’t lost an ounce!

B: Are you trying to lose weight?

A: Yeah, my friend is getting married next
month and I’m supposed to be a bridesmaid.
I have to fit into my dress and look nice for
her wedding, but I haven’t lost any weight!
Look at these love handles.

B: You don’t have to starve yourself to lose
weight. I think that’s where you’re going
wrong.

A: Why? If I eat less, then my body will start
eating away at my fat reserves right?

B: Not really. You should try to not eat foods
high in calories, salts or saturated fats. Stay
away from oily food and artificial flavors.

A: So you are saying that I should eat, but I
should just watch what I eat?

B: Yes! You can also try to reduce your
intake of carbohydrates and foods that are
high in cholesterol. You can have steamed
veggies or increase your protein intake found
in chicken or fish.

A: If I do all this do you think I can lose
twenty pounds in four weeks?

B: Don’t count on it.

== Elementary ‐The Office ‐ Asking For A Raise (C0188)

A: Excuse me sir, may I talk to you?

B: Bill! Sure, come on in. What can I do for
you?

A: Well sir, as you know, I have been an
employee of this prestigious firm for over ten
years.

B: Yes.

A: I won’t beat around the bush. Sir, I would
like a raise. I currently have three companies
after me and so I decided to talk to you first.

B: A raise? Son, I would love to give you a
raise, but this is just not the right time.

A: I understand your position, and I know
that the current economic downturn has had
a negative impact on sales, but you must
also take into consideration my hard work,
pro-activeness and loyalty to this company
for over a decade.

B: Taking into account these factors, and
considering I don’t want to start a brain
drain, I’m willing to offer you a ten percent
raise and an extra five days of vacation time.
How does that sound?

A: Great! It’s a deal! Thank you, sir!

B: Before you go, just out of curiosity, what
companies were after you?

A: Oh, the electric company, gas company
and water company!

'''


== Elementary‐ Daily Life‐ Buying A New Mobile Phone (C0189)

A: Hello sir, may I help you?

B: Yeah, I accidentally dropped my phone in
the toilet.

A: I see. Well, you have come to the right
place. We have over one hundred models of
more than twenty leading mobile phone
manufacturers.

B: Sounds good. I don’t want it to be too
expensive, maybe something mid-range.

A: We have this new HTC smart phone. It
comes with the Android OS so you can
download applications. It also has a built-in
camera, mp3 player and touch screen. It
works on the 3G network so you have fast
access to the internet wherever you are.

B: What about Wi-fi?

A: Of course! You can access the internet
from any hotspot as well as from home.

B: One last thing. Is it waterproof?

'''


== Elementary ‐The Weekend ‐ Family Barbecue (C0190)

A: Is everything ready for the big family
barbecue tomorrow?

B: Yep. The steaks and chicken are
60
Englishpod Dialogues
marinated and I also bought hamburger
buns.

A: We should also cook a couple dozen hot
dogs and kebabs.

B: Yeah, good idea. We can put some lawn
furniture outside next to the grill. I also set
up the tent outside so we can hide from the
sun if it gets too hot.

A: Great! I asked Grace to bring cups and
serviettes as she is also bringing two big
coolers for the beers.

B: This is gonna be a great barbecue!

'''


== Elementary‐Global View ‐ Daylight Savings Time (C0191)

A: Did you set your clock forward for daylight
savings time?

B: What? Why do we have to do that?

A: Well, at the start of the spring we usually
have more daylight in the mornings and less
in the afternoon. This is basically due to our
position on the planet and the rotation of the
earth. In any case, to take better advantage
of the daylight available, we compensate by
moving our clocks forward one hour.

B: I see. That’s convenient! I never
understood things like this, such as GMT. I
never know what time zone we are in or
when to change my clock!

A: That just stands for Greenwich Mean
Time. Here in California, we are in Pacific
Standard Time, that is eight time zones west
of Greenwich. Remember when we were in
Beijing? Well, then we were in China
Standard Time, and that’s eight time zones
east of Greenwich!

B: That’s why it was so weird traveling from
Beijing to LA! Because of the huge time
difference, even though we left Beijing at
noon and flew for more than eight hours, we
still arrived in LA the same day at noon! It’s
like we went back in time!

== Elementary ‐Global View ‐ Natural Disasters (C0192)
Bob: Those are the headlines for today, and
now for the international weather report with
Mike Sanderson.
Mike: Thank you, Bob! This past week has
been the beginning of Armageddon for many,
a series of unprecedented meteorological
events occurred around the world. In
Switzerland, a major avalanche was reported
in the Alps. Fortunately, no one was injured.
Due to to the extreme cold this winter, a
blizzard has struck the US Midwest, causing
classes in schools and universities to be
temporarily canceled.
Mike: Moving to to Latin American, Ecuador
has suffered a six month drought that has
not only affected farming, but has also forced
the closure of the hydroelectric power plant
that provides electricity for the entire
country. In Chile, a major earthquake that
registered seven point five on the Richter
scale struck the southern region. Losses are
reported to be in the billions. Authorities
have not yet released an official statement.
Bob: Not a great week for the world! Any
good news?
Mike: I’m afraid not, Bob. One of the major
volcanoes in Mexico has erupted, causing
major floods and landslides in the region.
Meanwhile, Mexico ’s coast has been hit by
hurricane Liliana and officials say that all the
seismic activity leads them to believe that a
tsunami may hit Central America, affecting
Honduras, Guatemala and Panama. That’s all
the news we have for today, but stay tuned
for updates on the six o’clock news. Back to
you Bob.

== Elementary‐Daily Life‐ Building Your Dream Home (C0193)

A: Mr. and Mrs. Robinson! Let’s get straight
to it. You have saved up your money for
years and are now ready to build your dream
home. What did you have in mind?

B: A suburban bungalow straight out of the
sixties! A perfect lawn with minimal
61
Englishpod Dialogues
landscaping. A brick patio in the backyard
with an old-fashioned grill, quaint lawn
furniture, and a swimming pool. A two-car
carport, pastel siding and a gable roof.
Completed with white shutters and a white
picket fence !

C: Uh, honey?

B: In the living room we would have mossgreen
rugs and a fireplace with a stone
mantle and wood paneling on the walls. In
the kitchen, the cupboards would be a pale
yellow and we would have a turquoise metal
oven and vinyl flooring -

C: Umm, sweetie, but I was thinking of a
more modern style house. An open concept
house, all glass, wood, metal, and concrete.

B: But sweetums, there is always a lot of
wasted space in those kinds of homes.
Besides, it’s just a fad. It doesn’t have the
homey feeling the old homes do.

C: Sweetie-pie it’s not a lot of wasted space.
It is relaxing and the house would be ecofriendly
with an in-floor heating system and
designed to retain the heat of the sun in the
winter and keep the house cool in the
summer. We would have solar panels on the
roof -

B: Do you know how much those things
cost?

C: What about your vintage furniture,
dearest? And instead of a lawn, which is also
a lot of wasted space and would require
environmentally harmful pesticides, we
would have a fish pond in the backyard and a
garden that would cover the whole yard so
we could grow our own food!

B: But buttercup, I thought you always said
that you loved visiting your grandmother’s
house!

C: And I thought you, Mr. Scientist, were all
up on saving the planet with your
technological advancements!

A: Umm well I am just going to go get some
coffee while you two keep discussing.

== Elementary ‐The Weekend ‐ Stir Fry (C0194)

A: Oh, man. I had the best supper last night.
My wife made a stir fry and it was amazing!

B: I love stir fry Crispy bite-sized vegetables
covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster
sauce. Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts.
Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger!
Mmm! Mmm! It’s almost lunchtime. I would
die for a plate of stir fry right now!

A: Well, you can keep the vegetables, I’ll
take the meat. The stir fry my wife made
was really hearty, with chunks of beef and
slivers of bell peppers and onion...

B: What? You call that a stir fry? More meat
than vegetables? That’s the worst insult you
could throw at a Chinese stir fry What a
disgrace to the wok she fried it in! What you
had is equivalent to a fajita without the
wrap! Silly Americans!

'''


== Elementary ‐Global View ‐ Job Hunting (C0195)

A: Woo hoo! This just might be the start of
the rest of my life!

B: What happened?

A: I’m in the market for a job! I went on a
website with hundreds of job listings in the
area and browsed through them until I got
the names of a few employers I would like to
work for. I have the resume I wrote for
English class last month and a cover letter
will be a piece of cake to write. I’ve even
done my research and found the names of
the managers so I can address the letters
personally. And you know I can be charming
in interviews. Goodbye my penniless days!
Hello salary and a career!

B: Ben, we’re fifteen. What kind of job are
you looking for?

A: Oh, just for a position as a gas station
attendant. You know, starting at a simple
lowly job, just like all the greats before they
made it big in the world.

B: Uh-huh.

A: But I’m just in it for the money, right?
How else am I going to be able to afford to

keep taking Angela to the movies? Besides, I
love the smell of gasoline, don’t you?

== Elementary ‐Daily Life ‐ Going To The Tailor (C0196)

A: Welcome to Bill’s Fabric World. What can I
do for you today?

B: I was wondering if you guys also tailor
clothes?

A: Sure we do! We have the best tailors in
the country! What is it that you need
exactly?

B: Well, I’m looking to get a custom-made
suit.

A: Excellent! We have the finest cashmeres
at affordable prices. How about we get you
measured? Let’s start off by measuring the
width of your shoulders. Now, let’s measure
the length of your arms and this bit around
your neck here.

B: Can you make sure you leave a little extra
space in the collar? My neck gets easily
irritated.

A: No problem! Now for your pants, let me
just measure your waist and the inseam.

B: You might also want to leave a little extra
room in the waist area. I tend to gain a few
pounds over the holidays.

A: OK. Now you can pick your fabric and
pattern design. Please follow me.

== Elementary ‐Global View ‐ Calling 911 (C0197)

A: Alright class, now that we’re all dressed
up let’s see what professions you chose. Ah,
I see a fireman, a police officer, a medic, and
a lifeguard! Can anyone tell me what these
people have in common?

B: They save people from bad things?

A: That’s right! Now class, if something bad
happened and you had to get help, do you
know what phone number you would call?

C: 911!

A: Yes, you would pick up the phone and dial
911. What are some emergency situations
where you would need to dial 911?

B: If my grandpa has a heart attack!

C: If there is an accident!

B: If a robber breaks into the house!

C: If the fire alarm goes off!

B: Pff! I wouldn’t call 911 if the fire alarm
went off in my house. The only time that
ever happens is when we’re having spaghetti
for supper, and Mom burns the garlic bread,
as usual.

'''


== Elementary ‐Daily Life ‐ Applying CPR (C0198)

A: Hello everyone and welcome to our CPR
for beginners course. First of all, does
anyone know what CPR stands for?

B: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation!

A: That’s right! We apply CPR in the case of
cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest.

B: What does that mean?

A: Well, basically if your heart stops pumping
blood, or your lungs stop pumping air, then
we need to get them going again! That’s
when we have to apply this procedure. Let’s
begin! I need a volunteer.

B: Me! Me!

A: Alright, come here and lay flat on your
back. Let’s suppose this young woman has
stopped breathing. We must lift the person’s
chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get
into the lungs. Then we place our mouth over
the other person’s mouth and blow air two or
three times, like this.

B: Wait, what are you doing? I’m a married
woman! You can’t just try to kiss me like
this!

A: Ma’ am I’m not trying to kiss you! I am
trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in
the case of an emergency.

B: Well, ok. But no French kissing!

A: As I was saying, we blow air through the
mouth in this manner. Once this is done, we
must try to get the heart going again. To do
this, we place our hands over the person’s
chest, and press down firmly two or three
times.

== Elementary‐Global View‐ Learning About First Aid (C0199)

A: Hey Joe! Where have you been these past
few days?

B: I’ve been busy with a first aid course that
I started about a week ago at the Red Cross.

A: Cool! I’ve always wanted to do something
like that! Have you learned anything useful?

B: For sure! I mean we’ve learned how to
apply pressure to stop bleeding, how to
check for a pulse, and even how to apply
CPR!

A: Have you treated any real emergencies?

B: Well, they took us along with some
paramedics. There was this guy who fell off
his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as
well as a couple of compound fractures. His
wounds were pretty serious so they had to
rush him to the hospital. It was intense!

A: I can imagine! I tend to faint when I see
blood, so I think I won’t be taking up a
course like that anytime soon!

'''


== Elementary ‐Daily Life ‐ Junk Food (C0200)

A: I’m hungry, let’s grab a bite to eat.

B: Sure! How about we go home and prepare
a couple of sandwiches?

A: Nah! Let’s go get a burger and fries.

B: All you ever do is have unhealthy fast
food Pizza, fries, burgers and hot dogs! You
have to start eating better!

A: What are you talking about? I have salads
sometimes.

B: Yeah right! I’m serious! You should also
cut down on your sugar intake as well. You
drink carbonated drinks that are high in
fructose syrup! It’s really not healthy!

A: Fine! I’ll start drinking and having home
cooked meals that are low in fat. Are you
happy now?

B: It’s a start, but I’ll be happy when I see
you stick to your promise!
