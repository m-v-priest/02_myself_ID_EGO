.案例
====
在“Fine! *Not like* Santa brought me any gifts!”这句话中，*“not like”表达的是一种轻蔑或讽刺的语气*，大致可以理解为：
“又不是说”,
“好像”,
“*才不是*”,
“并不是”,
具体来说，这句话的意思是：

他们用讽刺的语气说，好像（或才不是）圣诞老人给他们带来了任何礼物。

因此，这句话的整体情绪是： +
一种被忽视或被遗忘的感觉。 +
一种带有讽刺意味的抱怨。 +

因此，根据语境，这句话的更贴切的中文翻译可以为： +
“好吧！又不是说圣诞老人给我带了什么礼物！” +
“哼！好像圣诞老人给我送过礼物似的！” +
“切！并不是圣诞老人给我送礼物了！”

"not like" 这个短语在英语口语中比较常见，用来表达轻蔑、讽刺、惊讶等语气。以下是一些例子，以及它们的解释：

decided to create my own company! I’m
going to write up a business plan, get some
investors and start working for myself!

before?

have to do is explain your business, how you
are going to do things and that’s it, right?

B: You couldn’t be more wrong! A well
written business plan will include an
executive summary which highlights the idea
of the business in two pages or less. Then
you need to describe your company with
information such as what type of legal
structure it has, history, etc.

A: Well that seems easy enough.

B: Wait, there’s more! Then you need to
introduce and describe your goods or
services. What they are and how they are
different from competitors’? Then comes the
hard part, a market analysis. You need to
investigate and analyze hundreds of
variables! You need to take into consideration
socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to

population has! All this information is useful
so that you can move on to your strategy
and implementation stage, where you will
describe in detail how you will actually
execute your idea.

information for your investors will be the
financial analysis. Here you will calculate and

B: You don’t have to starve yourself to lose
weight. I think that’s where you’re going
wrong.

eating away at my fat reserves right?

away from oily food and artificial flavors.

should just watch what I eat?

intake of carbohydrates and foods that are

that the current economic downturn has had
a negative impact on sales, but you must
also take into consideration my hard work,
pro-activeness and loyalty to this company
for over a decade.

B: Taking into account these factors, and
considering I don’t want to start a brain
drain, I’m willing to offer you a ten percent
raise and an extra five days of vacation time.
How does that sound?

A: Great! It’s a deal! Thank you, sir!

B: Before you go, just out of curiosity, what
companies were after you?

and water company!

serviettes as she is also bringing two big
coolers for the beers.

B: This is gonna be a great barbecue!

'''


== Elementary‐Global View ‐ Daylight Savings Time (C0191)

A: Did you set your clock forward for daylight
savings time?

B: What? Why do we have to do that?

A: Well, at the start of the spring we usually
have more daylight in the mornings and less
in the afternoon. This is basically due to our
position on the planet and the rotation of the
earth. In any case, to take better advantage
of the daylight available, we compensate by
moving our clocks forward one hour.

B: I see. That’s convenient! I never
understood things like this, such as GMT. I
never know what time zone we are in or
when to change my clock!

A: That just stands for Greenwich Mean
Time. Here in California, we are in Pacific
Standard Time, that is eight time zones west
of Greenwich. Remember when we were in
Beijing? Well, then we were in China
Standard Time, and that’s eight time zones
east of Greenwich!

B: That’s why it was so weird traveling from
Beijing to LA! Because of the huge time
difference, even though we left Beijing at
noon and flew for more than eight hours, we
still arrived in LA the same day at noon! It’s
like we went back in time!

Bob: Those are the headlines for today, and
now for the international weather report with
Mike Sanderson.
Mike: Thank you, Bob! This past week has
been the beginning of Armageddon for many,
a series of unprecedented meteorological
events occurred around the world. In
Switzerland, a major avalanche was reported
in the Alps. Fortunately, no one was injured.
Due to to the extreme cold this winter, a
blizzard has struck the US Midwest, causing
classes in schools and universities to be
temporarily canceled.
Mike: Moving to to Latin American, Ecuador
has suffered a six month drought that has
not only affected farming, but has also forced
the closure of the hydroelectric power plant
that provides electricity for the entire
country. In Chile, a major earthquake that
registered seven point five on the Richter
scale struck the southern region. Losses are
reported to be in the billions. Authorities
have not yet released an official statement.
Bob: Not a great week for the world! Any
good news?
Mike: I’m afraid not, Bob. One of the major
volcanoes in Mexico has erupted, causing
major floods and landslides in the region.
Meanwhile, Mexico ’s coast has been hit by
hurricane Liliana and officials say that all the
seismic activity leads them to believe that a
tsunami may hit Central America, affecting
Honduras, Guatemala and Panama. That’s all
the news we have for today, but stay tuned

to it. You have saved up your money for
years and are now ready to build your dream
home. What did you have in mind?

B: A suburban bungalow straight out of the
sixties! A perfect lawn with minimal

landscaping. A brick patio in the backyard
with an old-fashioned grill, quaint lawn
furniture, and a swimming pool. A two-car
carport, pastel siding and a gable roof.
Completed with white shutters and a white
picket fence !

C: Uh, honey?

B: In the living room we would have mossgreen
rugs and a fireplace with a stone
mantle and wood paneling on the walls. In
the kitchen, the cupboards would be a pale
yellow and we would have a turquoise metal
oven and vinyl flooring -

C: Umm, sweetie, but I was thinking of a
more modern style house. An open concept
house, all glass, wood, metal, and concrete.

B: But sweetums, there is always a lot of
wasted space in those kinds of homes.
Besides, it’s just a fad. It doesn’t have the
homey feeling the old homes do.

C: Sweetie-pie it’s not a lot of wasted space.
It is relaxing and the house would be ecofriendly
with an in-floor heating system and
designed to retain the heat of the sun in the
winter and keep the house cool in the
summer. We would have solar panels on the
roof -

B: Do you know how much those things
cost?

C: What about your vintage furniture,
dearest? And instead of a lawn, which is also
a lot of wasted space and would require
environmentally harmful pesticides, we
would have a fish pond in the backyard and a
garden that would cover the whole yard so
we could grow our own food!

B: But buttercup, I thought you always said
that you loved visiting your grandmother’s
house!

C: And I thought you, Mr. Scientist, were all
up on saving the planet with your
technological advancements!

A: Umm well I am just going to go get some
coffee while you two keep discussing.

B: What? You call that a stir fry? More meat

just measure your waist and the inseam.

B: You might also want to leave a little extra
room in the waist area. I tend to gain a few
pounds over the holidays.

A: OK. Now you can pick your fabric and
pattern design. Please follow me.

== Elementary ‐Global View ‐ Calling 911 (C0197)

A: Alright class, now that we’re all dressed
up let’s see what professions you chose. Ah,
I see a fireman, a police officer, a medic, and
a lifeguard! Can anyone tell me what these
people have in common?

B: They save people from bad things?

A: That’s right! Now class, if something bad
happened and you had to get help, do you
know what phone number you would call?

C: 911!

A: Yes, you would pick up the phone and dial
911. What are some emergency situations
where you would need to dial 911?

B: If my grandpa has a heart attack!

C: If there is an accident!

B: If a robber breaks into the house!

C: If the fire alarm goes off!

B: Pff! I wouldn’t call 911 if the fire alarm
went off in my house. The only time that
ever happens is when we’re having spaghetti
for supper, and Mom burns the garlic bread,
as usual.

== Elementary ‐Daily Life ‐ Applying CPR (C0198)

A: Hello everyone and welcome to our CPR
for beginners course. First of all, does
anyone know what CPR stands for?

B: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation!

A: That’s right! We apply CPR in the case of
cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest.

B: What does that mean?

A: Well, basically if your heart stops pumping
blood, or your lungs stop pumping air, then
we need to get them going again! That’s
when we have to apply this procedure. Let’s
begin! I need a volunteer.

B: Me! Me!

A: Alright, come here and lay flat on your
back. Let’s suppose this young woman has
stopped breathing. We must lift the person’s
chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get
into the lungs. Then we place our mouth over
the other person’s mouth and blow air two or
three times, like this.

B: Wait, what are you doing? I’m a married
woman! You can’t just try to kiss me like
this!

A: Ma’ am I’m not trying to kiss you! I am
trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in
the case of an emergency.

B: Well, ok. But no French kissing!

A: As I was saying, we blow air through the
mouth in this manner. Once this is done, we
must try to get the heart going again. To do
this, we place our hands over the person’s
chest, and press down firmly two or three
times.

B: Wait, what are you doing! You can’t just

== Elementary‐Global View‐ Learning About First Aid (C0199)

A: Hey Joe! Where have you been these past
few days?

B: I’ve been busy with a first aid course that
I started about a week ago at the Red Cross.

A: Cool! I’ve always wanted to do something
like that! Have you learned anything useful?

B: For sure! I mean we’ve learned how to
apply pressure to stop bleeding, how to
check for a pulse, and even how to apply
CPR!

A: Have you treated any real emergencies?

B: Well, they took us along with some
paramedics. There was this guy who fell off
his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as
well as a couple of compound fractures. His
wounds were pretty serious so they had to
rush him to the hospital. It was intense!

A: I can imagine! I tend to faint when I see
blood, so I think I won’t be taking up a
course like that anytime soon!

== Elementary ‐Daily Life ‐ Junk Food (C0200)

A: I’m hungry, let’s grab a bite to eat.

B: Sure! How about we go home and prepare
a couple of sandwiches?

A: Nah! Let’s go get a burger and fries.

B: All you ever do is have unhealthy fast
food Pizza, fries, burgers and hot dogs! You
have to start eating better!

A: What are you talking about? I have salads
sometimes.

B: Yeah right! I’m serious! You should also
cut down on your sugar intake as well. You
drink carbonated drinks that are high in
fructose syrup! It’s really not healthy!

A: Fine! I’ll start drinking and having home
cooked meals that are low in fat. Are you
happy now?

B: It’s a start, but I’ll be happy when I see
you stick to your promise!
