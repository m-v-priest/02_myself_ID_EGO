you still haven’t given me your half.

B: Yeah I wanted to talk to you about that. I
agreed we would go halves on allthe bills,

A: Unfair! Why?

B: Well, you have long hair and use the
hairdryer every morning. I don’t. You leave
your computer on all night downloading
torrents. I don’t. You see what I’m getting at
here?

A: You leave the air conditioner on day and
night! You also take 30 minute showers
which means you are using way more gas

B: Well, while we are at it, stop bringing your

online quick and easy.

A: I see, but how do you pay for it? How do
you know you aren’t going to be ripped off
by the seller?

B: Well, the website handles a point system
where if the seller does something wrong,
people comment negatively and then you
know that he or she may not be trustworthy.

A: Wow, that sounds pretty safe. So how do
you pay? Do you need a credit card?

B: You can use a credit card or your debit
card. They also let you use the PayPal
system which is really safe and fast. I have
never had any problems with someone
hacking my information or anything.

NASDAQ is down 200 points, the DOW

week ago.

B: How is this possible? You are supposed to
be talking to our stockbrokers and making
sure that our securities and investments are
safe and making a profitable return!

A: I know sir! We didn’t expect a bull market
to become a bear market all of a sudden. On
the other hand, you still have some high
yield trash bonds and government bonds that
will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses
and reinvest in emerging markets. We could
potentially make this tragedy work for us and

this. If they find out, it’s the end of this

really liked you anyway!
Je: Whatever! Alright, I’ll concede the silly
gramophone, if you’ll agree that I get the
silver tea set.
Joanne:How typical, when are you ever
going to use a silver tea set? Fine! I don’t
want to drag this out any longer than
necessary. What’s next? What about these
old photographs?
Je: Which ones? Let me have a look. Wow,
look at that! That brings back memories. . . .
That?
Joanne:Our trip to Italy! I remember that
day. We were going to visit the Trevi
fountain, and we got caught in the rain. . . .
Je: . . . and you looked so adorable with your
hair all wet. I had to take a picture of you
standing there in that little alley, smiling and
laughing in the rain. . . .
Joanne: Oh, we really did have fun back
then didn’t we?
Je: Oh, Joanne, are we making a big
mistake? I know our relationship has been on
the rocks for sometime but are you sure we
can’t reconcile and try again? I still love you.
Joanne:Oh Jeff! I love you too! I’m so glad
we didn’t have to decide who keeps the
motorcycle.
Je: The motorcycle? But that’s mine!

living room? I don’t think so!
