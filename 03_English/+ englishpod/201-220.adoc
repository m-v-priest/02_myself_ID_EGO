the postcards and I need to weigh that
package, too.

A: Well, it depends. Do you want to send it
via priority, express or standard mail?

working days . Priority is a bit faster and will
arrive in about five to eight working days.
Express is the fastest, but it’s also the most

can track your package online.

via priority mail. Please be extra careful, the
contents of the package are fragile.

the jury, My client, Robert Malone, has been
accused of a crime he did not commit. The

== Elementary ‐The Office ‐ Closing The Deal (C0205)
Mr. Smith: I’m glad you could find time to
meet with me, Mr. Johnson. I can’t think of a
nicer environment for our meeting today, the
ambiance here is lovely!
Mr. Johnson: No problem, if possible I
always combine business with pleasure. Now,
let’s hear more about these chocolates you’re
offering.
Mr. Smith: Well, as you know, I have
recently become the sole distributor for
Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the
United States. They’re a new manufacturer
and are looking to break into the luxury
market. Naturally, your restaurant sprang
into my mind immediately. I think your brand
exemplifies many ofthe same traits as
Grangers and serving these chocolates would
really add to your reputation for providing
elegant, luxurious, first class dining.
Mr. Johnson: Hmmm, sounds interesting. . .
. gourmet chocolates , where are they
produced? Belgium?
Mr. Smith: Actually, the factory is located in
Scotland.
Mr. Johnson: Really? I didn’t think they
were known for their luxury chocolate
production. . .
Mr. Smith: That’s what makes this such a
fantastic opportunity! The government is one
hundred percent supportive of creating new
export markets and has guaranteed a low
tariff for all wholesale orders of over one
thousand units. They’ve also reduced the red
65

tape involved at customs as well. Here, I
brought these especially for you, try one!
Mr. Johnson: Oh, thanks. Mmm, hmm,
creamy texture, smooth. . . .
Mr. Smith: Unique aren’t they? I bet you’ve
never tasted anything like it! Quality is
assured as I personally visit the factory to
make sure no one’s cutting corners with the
ingredients. Only the cr `eme de la cr `eme
make it through inspection.
Mr. Johnson: Yes, very interesting
flavors. . . . . . . Slightly spicy, very unique,
that’s for sure. Exactly what ARE the
ingredients?
Mr. Smith: I have it on highest authority
that this traditional secret recipe has been
handed down inthe Granger family for
generations. I’m sure you can keep a secret.
Buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar and Haggis.
Mr. Johnson: Haggis? What’s Haggis?
Mr. Smith: It’s a traditional Scottish
delicacy; you take sheep’s liver, heart and
lung and stuff it inside ofthe sheep’s
stomach.
Mr. Johnson: Ah, get back to you.
Mr. Smith: Mr. Johnson? Mr. Johnson?

A: Charlie, do you have a second?

B: Yeah what’s up?

A: Well, I went and paid the bills today and
you still haven’t given me your half.

B: Yeah I wanted to talk to you about that. I
agreed we would go halves on allthe bills,
but frankly I think it’s unfair.

A: Unfair! Why?

B: Well, you have long hair and use the
hairdryer every morning. I don’t. You leave
your computer on all night downloading
torrents. I don’t. You see what I’m getting at
here?

A: You leave the air conditioner on day and
night! You also take 30 minute showers
which means you are using way more gas
and water than me!

B: Well, while we are at it, stop bringing your
friends over for drinks every weekend. You
always leave a mess and keep me up all

A: What are you doing?

B: I’m just looking for a nice pillow on Ebay.

A: You are shopping for a pillow online?
That’s absurd!

B: Why? I don’t have to leave the house or
browse a dozen stores to find what I’m
looking for. This way, I just search for it
online quick and easy.

A: I see, but how do you pay for it? How do
you know you aren’t going to be ripped off
by the seller?

B: Well, the website handles a point system
where if the seller does something wrong,
people comment negatively and then you
know that he or she may not be trustworthy.

A: Wow, that sounds pretty safe. So how do
you pay? Do you need a credit card?

B: You can use a credit card or your debit
card. They also let you use the PayPal
system which is really safe and fast. I have
never had any problems with someone
hacking my information or anything.

A: Do you think I can find a sweater for my
dog online?

B: You can find anything! Are you sure you
want to start shopping online though? Once
you step into this world, there is no turning
back!

A: Let’s do it!

A: Well, the stock market just took a huge

66

B: What do you mean? What happened?

A: There are many factors that weigh in, but
NASDAQ is down 200 points, the DOW
JONES indicator also suffered! Our portfolio
is worth half of what it was worth points
week ago.

B: How is this possible? You are supposed to
be talking to our stockbrokers and making
sure that our securities and investments are
safe and making a profitable return!

A: I know sir! We didn’t expect a bull market
to become a bear market all of a sudden. On
the other hand, you still have some high
yield trash bonds and government bonds that
will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses
and reinvest in emerging markets. We could
potentially make this tragedy work for us and
make us think outside the box.

B: Do what you have to do! One other thing,
don’t tell the rest of the stockholders about
this. If they find out, it’s the end of this
company!
