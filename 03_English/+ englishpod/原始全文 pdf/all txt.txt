B: So what are you going to do? Take up an

A: Well, first of all, I’ve decided to stop

decided to create my own company! I’m
going to write up a business plan, get some
investors and start working for myself!

B: Have you ever written up a business plan
before?

A: Well, it can’t be that hard! I mean, all you
have to do is explain your business, how you
are going to do things and that’s it, right?

B: You couldn’t be more wrong! A well
written business plan will include an
executive summary which highlights the idea
of the business in two pages or less. Then
you need to describe your company with
information such as what type of legal
structure it has, history, etc.

A: Well that seems easy enough.

B: Wait, there’s more! Then you need to
introduce and describe your goods or
services. What they are and how they are
different from competitors’? Then comes the
hard part, a market analysis. You need to
investigate and analyze hundreds of
variables! You need to take into consideration
socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to
how many children on average the
population has! All this information is useful
so that you can move on to your strategy
and implementation stage, where you will
describe in detail how you will actually
execute your idea.

A: Geez. Is that all?

B: Almost, the most important piece of
information for your investors will be the
financial analysis. Here you will calculate and
estimate sales, cash flow and profits. After
all, people will want to know when they will
begin to see a return on their investment!

A: Umm. I think I’ll just stick to my old job

B: You don’t have to starve yourself to lose
weight. I think that’s where you’re going
wrong.

A: Why? If I eat less, then my body will start
eating away at my fat reserves right?

B: Not really. You should try to not eat foods
high in calories, salts or saturated fats. Stay
away from oily food and artificial flavors.

A: So you are saying that I should eat, but I
should just watch what I eat?

B: Yes! You can also try to reduce your
intake of carbohydrates and foods that are
high in cholesterol. You can have steamed
veggies or increase your protein intake found
in chicken or fish.

Elementary‐Global View ‐ Daylight Savin
gs Time (C0191)

A: Did you set your clock forward for daylight
savings time?

B: What? Why do we have to do that?

A: Well, at the start of the spring we usually
have more daylight in the mornings and less
in the afternoon. This is basically due to our
position on the planet and the rotation of the
earth. In any case, to take better advantage
of the daylight available, we compensate by
moving our clocks forward one hour.

B: I see. That’s convenient! I never
understood things like this, such as GMT. I
never know what time zone we are in or
when to change my clock!

A: That just stands for Greenwich Mean
Time. Here in California, we are in Pacific
Standard Time, that is eight time zones west
of Greenwich. Remember when we were in
Beijing? Well, then we were in China
Standard Time, and that’s eight time zones
east of Greenwich!

B: That’s why it was so weird traveling from
Beijing to LA! Because of the huge time
difference, even though we left Beijing at
noon and flew for more than eight hours, we
still arrived in LA the same day at noon! It’s
like we went back in time!

B: In the living room we would have mossgreen
rugs and a fireplace with a stone
mantle and wood paneling on the walls. In
the kitchen, the cupboards would be a pale
yellow and we would have a turquoise metal
oven and vinyl flooring -

C: Umm, sweetie, but I was thinking of a
more modern style house. An open concept
house, all glass, wood, metal, and concrete.

B: But sweetums, there is always a lot of
wasted space in those kinds of homes.
Besides, it’s just a fad. It doesn’t have the
homey feeling the old homes do.

C: Sweetie-pie it’s not a lot of wasted space.
It is relaxing and the house would be ecofriendly
with an in-floor heating system and
designed to retain the heat of the sun in the
winter and keep the house cool in the
summer. We would have solar panels on the
roof -

B: Do you know how much those things
cost?

C: What about your vintage furniture,
dearest? And instead of a lawn, which is also
a lot of wasted space and would require
environmentally harmful pesticides, we
would have a fish pond in the backyard and a
garden that would cover the whole yard so
we could grow our own food!

we need to get them going again! That’s
when we have to apply this procedure. Let’s
begin! I need a volunteer.

B: Me! Me!

A: Alright, come here and lay flat on your
back. Let’s suppose this young woman has
stopped breathing. We must lift the person’s
chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get
into the lungs. Then we place our mouth over
the other person’s mouth and blow air two or
three times, like this.

B: Wait, what are you doing? I’m a married
woman! You can’t just try to kiss me like
this!

A: Ma’ am I’m not trying to kiss you! I am
trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in
the case of an emergency.

B: Well, ok. But no French kissing!

A: As I was saying, we blow air through the
mouth in this manner. Once this is done, we
must try to get the heart going again. To do
this, we place our hands over the person’s
chest, and press down firmly two or three
times.

agreed we would go halves on allthe bills,
but frankly I think it’s unfair.

A: Unfair! Why?

B: Well, you have long hair and use the
hairdryer every morning. I don’t. You leave
your computer on all night downloading
torrents. I don’t. You see what I’m getting at

A: You leave the air conditioner on day and

A: You are shopping for a pillow online?
That’s absurd!

B: Why? I don’t have to leave the house or
browse a dozen stores to find what I’m
looking for. This way, I just search for it
online quick and easy.

A: I see, but how do you pay for it? How do
you know you aren’t going to be ripped off
by the seller?

B: Well, the website handles a point system
where if the seller does something wrong,
people comment negatively and then you
know that he or she may not be trustworthy.

A: Wow, that sounds pretty safe. So how do
you pay? Do you need a credit card?

B: You can use a credit card or your debit
card. They also let you use the PayPal
system which is really safe and fast. I have
never had any problems with someone
hacking my information or anything.

A: Do you think I can find a sweater for my
dog online?

A: There are many factors that weigh in, but
NASDAQ is down 200 points, the DOW

week ago.

B: How is this possible? You are supposed to
be talking to our stockbrokers and making
sure that our securities and investments are
safe and making a profitable return!

A: I know sir! We didn’t expect a bull market
to become a bear market all of a sudden. On
the other hand, you still have some high
yield trash bonds and government bonds that
will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses
and reinvest in emerging markets. We could
potentially make this tragedy work for us and

int (C0222)

A: So what’s your guys’ take on all this
global warming hysteria in the media?

B: It’s pretty serious, man. There have been
tons of scientific studies and the scientific
community says that the earth is heating up.
We need to make some drastic changes to
our lifestyle if we want to preserve our
planet.

A: I don’t know. It sounds like a bunch of
mumbo jumbo if you ask me. ”Save the
earth!” The earth will save itself. It’s survived
worst disasters in the past. I mean, honestly,
we live in the boonies. There’s no way
anyone here is ever going to walk or bike to
work, especially in the winter. And we have
no bus system. My house is forty years old
and it would take a lot of money to get it
refitted to be ”green” and ”energy-efficient”.

C: Well I don’t really know if I believe in
global warming either, or whether or not it
was our doing or a natural change the earth
is going through, but you have to admit that
we’re living pretty irresponsibly here in the
west.

A: I guess...

C: I think the issue at hand is sustainability.
We’ve only got this one earth we can live on,
and our resources are quickly disappearing
because of our own carelessness and our
inability to think of anyone but ourselves and
anything but the present.

B: So, like I was saying, we need to change
the way we live. We need to reduce our
carbon footprint.

C: But it doesn’t have to be that drastic.
Hybrid vehicles and solar panels are too
expensive to be feasible right now. And we
don’t have to be hippies living off the land
and buying everything organic either, though
it helps.

B: I car pool to work everyday with some
buddies of mine. I have a rain barrel outside
my house I use to water my plants and my
lawn in the summer, and I make sure I
always bring reusable bags with me when I
get my groceries. And we just started using
bio-degradable plastic made from corn oil for
take-out orders at my family’s restaurant.
Remember the three R’s? Reduce. Reuse.
Recycle.

C: Exactly, it’s just small simple changes, like
buying energy-saving light bulbs, starting a
compost bin, recycling bottles and papers,
using reusable water bottles, stop using
disposable cups and cutlery.

A: Trina, will you marry me?

B: Yes! Yes! And yes! Jared of course I’ll
marry you!

A: Oh Babe, I can’t wait to spend the rest of
my life with you! I can’t wait for all the
adventures we’re going to have, for all the
fights and the laughter. I can’t wait to grow
old and wrinkly with you.

B: Oh Jared! I can’t wait for our wedding! I
hope you don’t mind, but I’ve already chosen
a date! Six months from now in the summer!
Melissa saw you buying the ring last month
so I’ve had plenty of time to start planning!

A: She what?

B: Oh don’t worry sweetie, I didn’t know
when you were going to propose. It was still
a nice surprise! As I was saying, I’ve got it all
planned out. There’s almost nothing left to
do! I wrote up our guest list and we will have
roughly four hundred guests
attending.

A: four hundred?

B: No need to sweat it. My parents agreed to
pay for most of the wedding, which is going
to be low budget anyway. So roughly four
hundred people, which means that the hall at
Northwood Heights will be our reception
venue. I thought it would be nice if we had
the wedding at your parents’ church and my
uncle of course would be officiating. We’ll
meet with him soon for some pre-wedding
counseling. The music for the wedding
ceremony was a no-brainer. My step-sister
and her string quartet will take care of that.
My cousin will be the official photographer. I
thought it would also be nice if his daughter
could sing a solo. Did you know that she’s
going to be a professional opera singer?

A: Ah...

B: And then of course the ladies at the
church would love to be our caterers for the
banquet and we’ll get the Youth Group to
serve us. I was thinking that your friend’s
band could be our entertainment for the
night. though they might have to tone it
down a bit. Or we could hire a DJ. Your
sister’s husband could get us a discount with
that company that does the decor at
weddings. What’s their name again? I was
thinking that we could have an island
paradise- themed wedding and our theme
color would be a soothing blue like
Aquamarine.
And there will be a huge seashell on the wall
behind the podium where we’ll make our
toasts! What do you think of small packages
of drink mixes for our wedding favors? Who
else am I missing? Oh, your uncle could be
our florist and his wife could make our
wedding cake!

A: Wow.

B: See? It’s going to be wonderful! Oh this
wedding is going to be everything I ever
dreamed of.

A: If I survive the next six months.

Don’t stray too far. Wait! Leave your sandals
here or put on your wet shoes.

A: And stay in the shallow area. I don’t want
to see you go any farther than that sandbar!
It’s too deep out there and we didn’t bring
your floaties.

B: You’re back already? The water was too
cold, huh? I’ll tell you a secret. Do you see
that small pool of water over there? It’ll be
warmer in there. Go see if you can find some
seashells or catch some minnows.

you have in mind?
Mom: Black. Classic.
Salesgirl: Of course. We’ve got this style

open-toe shoe, you can wear it any time of
the year. They look great on everyone.
Mom: Umm. too shiny. And I wear
pantyhose with my shoes so let’s look for a
closed-toe shoe.
Salesgirl: Ok, these are a very nice pair of
leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they
are very comfortable.
Mom: I don’t like the pointed toes. Let me
take a look at what else you have. Too high.
That one looks like the back would cut into
my heel. I have a high instep so I doubt that
one will fit properly. I don’t want bows. I find
slingbacks very uncomfortable. Those might
as well be stilettos. Too modern. Ah, finally,
this is what I’m looking for.
Salesgirl: What size?
Mom: Seven-and-a-half.
Salesgirl: Here we are How does it fit?
Mom: Hmmm. not good. They’re too tight.
The length is right, but the shoe is too
narrow and it’s pinching my toes. And there’d
be no room for my insoles. You know what? I
don’t think I have the patience for this today.
They just don’t make shoes like they used to.

trouble sleeping these past few weeks. I
usually lie in bed for hours trying to get to
sleep . I’ve tried stretching and different
breathing techniques before going to bed .
I’ve tried eating and not eating different
foods. I’ve even tried counting sheep! And
then when I finally get to sleep , I have these
really disturbing nightmares, so I usually
wake up in a panic and more tired than
before I went to sleep .
Jill: Wow, maybe you should get that
checked out. Maybe you’re stressed?

C: Just take some sedatives! Works for me!
Every so often having some melatonin on
hand helps me when I have trouble sleeping.
It works on all kinds of sleeping disorders.
It’s the stuff pilots use to regulate their
sleeping patterns.
Jill: I heard of that. But does that apply to
Alex’s situation?

C: Ya sure, why not? Sounds like he only has

taking melatonin do the trick.

(C0237)
Jacob: Stephanie! Did you just get to
school? But you were up and about when I
left the dorm this morning! That was about
an hour and a half ago. This happens all the
time! Why do you always take so long to get
ready the morning?
Stephanie: It’s a skill. What can I say? I
don’t know why, I just have a long routine.
Jacob: Please explain because it makes no
sense to me. How can a girl’s routine be so
complicated? You get up, you shower, you
get dressed , you brush your teeth, you’re
out the door. Half an hour, tops.
Stephanie: Jacob, you have the luxury of
having a haircut that rarely needs styling. I
don’t. I have to set aside about an hour and
a half to get ready in the mornings. Every
day, I wake up and head straight for the
shower. Every second day, I wash my hair. If
it’s a hair-washing day, I frequently need to
wash my hair twice because it gets really
oily. Then I usually put in a conditioner and
have to rinse that out too. Because my hair
is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower
in under twenty minutes. Afterwards, I often
put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I
wait for it to brew. I take a long time to get
dressed in the morning. Every now and then
I remember to choose my outfit the night
before , but usually I do it in the morning. In
all, getting dressed takes about half an
hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry
so then I have to style my hair. From time to
time I’ll put my hair up, but oftentimes I
blowdry it straight. And then, because of the
texture of my hair, I regularly have to flatiron
it to keep it from frizzing. That’s another
twenty minutes or so. After that, I have my
daily makeup routine.
Jacob: True, I hardly ever see you without
your hair done and your makeup on, even
when you show up to class in sweatpants.
Tell me, how long does it take you to choose
that outfit in the morning?

questions please feel free to ask me.
Mr. Parsons: Well yes, I do have a number
of questions, but perhaps first you could give
me a brief overview I’d like to get a little bit
of an idea of your background.
Rebecca: yes of course. Well as you can see
from the resume I’m up and grew up in
Brooklyn, New York, although our family
moved to London when I was quite young, at
around rook.
Mr. Parsons: Ah I see, so you were actually
educated in Europe?
Rebecca: yes precisely. Although I was born
in the US, I would definitely call London
home. But as you see I’ve actually spent a
lot of my life moving from country to
country. My Father was inthe oil business
before he retired so we also spent a number
of years in Saudi Arabia too.
Mr. Parsons: Very interesting. So it seems
you had quite an adventurous childhood.

A: How long does it take to get there?

B: About twelve hours. We currently have
tickets available only for first class on the
express train. If you’d like, you can choose a
sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit
less expensive.

A: Yeah, I think that is the best option. Do
you serve food on the train? Twelve hours is
such a long time!

B: Yes of course. There is a dining car
towards the front of the train where they
serve meals at all times. We do provide
complimentary water and coffee for all of our
passengers.

A: Great! I’ll take it.

B: Here you are sir. Your train leaves from
platform number nine at nine on the dot.
Remember to be here at least thirty minutes
before your scheduled departure time or else
you might miss your train!

A: I understand. Thank you very much !

B: Have a great trip.

ng Reasons
For Leaving Previous Position (C0247)
Mr. Parsons: Okay, now I’d like to find out
more about your last job. I see you spent
almost four years at the London Weekly , is
that right?
Rebecca: Yes, that’s right. To be honest, the
first year was quite tough for me. I was
really just treated more like an intern. I
didn’t have many responsibilities and I found
it quite frustrating.
Mr. Parsons: So, what changed?
Rebecca: Well slowly but surely I proved
myself, and the new editor liked me so he
promoted me to features writer .
Mr. Parsons: Wow, a real step up!
Rebecca: Yes I was responsible for
restaurant and food reviews mostly. I spent
restaurant years in that position, but to be
honest it wasn’t an area of journalism I
wanted to stay in long-term.
Mr. Parsons: I see, so why did you decide
to leave finally?
Rebecca: I just felt that the paper couldn’t
offer me any new opportunities. I really
needed a more challenging role to be honest.
Daily Life ‐ Dinnerware (C0248)

A: Honey can you set the table?

B: Um, sure. What are we having for dinner?
Do I need to put out anything in particular?

A: Well, make sure to put out the pepper and
salt shakers. I don’t know if your brother is
coming tonight so set an extra place mat just
in case.

B: Ok, should I use the fancy silverware?

A: Yeah go ahead, forks, spoons and knives.
I roasted some meat so be sure to put out
some steak knives as well.

B: I’ll also set some cups and saucers for
some coffee after dinner.

A: Honey? Have you seen our soup bowls?

B: They are in the cupboard where you keep
the gravy boat and serving dishes. Just be
careful because the wine glasses are also
there.

A: Oops!
The Weekend ‐ Making A Sandwich (C02
49)

A: Welcome to our show! Today, I am going
to show you how to make the perfect
mouthwatering sandwich! Are you ready?
Let’s get started !

A: Let’s start with the basics :bread. Bread is
an important ingredient here. You need to
remember one thing -choose the bread
according to the following
criteria :freshness, crumb and color. If you
want a closed sandwich I recommend you
first toast your bread in a toaster or oven, or
grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.

A: Now that our bread is ready, let’s talk
82
Englishpod Dialogues
about the ingredients ! Of course, each
person’s palate is different, but I’m going to
give you a few tips that you’ll be able to use
when turning any sandwich into the perfect
sandwich. I would strongly recommend you
put fresh vegetables in your sandwich.

A: Do not undervalue them as they play a
big role in forming the taste and will make
the sandwich more refreshing and light. The
best choices here are evident- cucumbers,
tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper pepper or
chilli, lettuce and, of course, herbs- you can’t
go wrong with them. As for aubergines,
mushrooms and asparagus, I would
recommend you first grill them slightly with a
little touch of olive oil.

A: Last but not least, we have a wide variety
of condiments that we can add to our perfect
sandwich. We can be subtle and just add a
touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine
mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup or even
caviar to achieve a stronger flavor! It’s
always a good idea to cut your sandwich in
triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all
your ingredients falling out and staining your
shirt!

A: That’s all the time we have for today, but
join us next time where we’ll be going over
how to make the perfect lasagna! Till next
time!

Strengths (C0250)
Mr. Parsons: Okay Rebecca. Now youyou’ve
given me a good idea of your work and
academic background, but what about you as
a person? How would you describe your key
strengths?
Rebecca: Well Mr. Parsons, as I mentioned
before I’m someone who needs new
challenges. I’m really focused and hard hardworking.
I think my academic results prove
this.
Mr. Parsons: Yes, true, but how about other
personal qualities? Hmmmmm, that's a
tough question. But I would have to say my
passion. I'm really passionate about
journalism and passionate about my career.
Rebecca: Well I believe I’m a good teamplayer,
but I can also work well
independently. I’m very enthusiastic and ,
well I hope my colleagues would agree, I’m
fun to work with.
Mr. Parsons: What would you say is your
most positive quality?
Rebecca: Hmmmmm, that’s a tough
question. But I would have to say my
passion. I’m really passionate about
journalism and passionate about my career.
The Weekend ‐ Buying Makeup (C0251)

A: I’m hungry, let’s go grab a bite to eat.

B: Yeah me too. Oh! Can we stop at the shop
really fast? I lost my makeup bag at the
airport and I want to pick up a few things.

A: Will you take long?

B: No! Five minutes I promise!

A: Come on! We have been here for almost
an hour! I thought you said you were only
going to get a few things! How long does it
take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail
polish!

B: Are you crazy! You have no idea what you
are talking about! Just for my eyes I have to
get eyeliner, an eyelash curler, eye shadow,
an eyebrow pencil and mascara. Then I need
to get foundation, liquid foundation.

A: Whoa whoa whoa! Are you nuts? How
much is all this going to cost? I’m looking at
the price at each one of these little things
and it’s outrageous! This is basically a
crayon!

B: What about you? You spend as much or
more money on your razors, after shave,
cologne and gel! Not to mention how much
you spend on clothes and...

A: Fine! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon!
Global View ‐ Contraceptives (C0252)

A: Alright, settle down everyone. As part of
this school’s curriculum we’ll be covering sex
ed this week.

A: Now I want everyone to take this class
83
Englishpod Dialogues
seriously, sexual education is very important
and I want you to ask as many questions as
you can think of. Remember, there are no
stupid questions here.

B: Miss Carlton? What exactly is sexual
education? Are you going to teach us like
Kama sutra stuff like that?

A: No Jason, that’s not exactly what sex ed
is. Basically, we will talk about sexually
transmitted diseases, contraceptives and how
the male and female bodies work.

B: My older sister is in college and she takes
what she and her friends call the pill. I never
really understood what that is, but I know it
has to do with sex or something.

A: Good point Jason! This will be the topic of
our first class, contraceptives. As you
mentioned, the pill is one of the many that
exist. The birth control pill is taken daily by a
woman in order to prevent unwanted
pregnancy, but it does not protect her from
contracting STD’s from an infected person.
Another popular method is using condoms.
This is probably the best method if you have
sex, since it not only prevents a woman from
getting pregnant but also protects both from
STD’s. Yes Jason?

B: What are condoms made out of? How
exactly is it that a woman gets pregnant?

A: Condoms are usually made out of an
elastic material called Latex. As for your
other question, that’s a whole new class.

Weaknesses (C0253)
Mr. Parsons: Okay Rebecca, well I think
you’ve given me a clear impression of your
positive qualities, but let’s talk a little bit
about your weaknesses.
Rebecca: Okay, well it’s always more
difficult to describe them isn’t it?
Mr. Parsons: Definitely, but if you had to
pinpoint one weakness what would it be?
Rebecca: Well as I mentioned before, I do
tend to get frustrated if I don’t see progress
in my work or career. I suppose I’m quite a
restless character. My father always taught
me to be a high achiever so.
Mr. Parsons: So would you say if things
don’t go your way at work it could easily get
you down?
Rebecca: Well, in a way yes. But I must say
that even if I’m not completely happy in my
work I always give 110% I would never shirk
my responsibilities. I suppose sometimes
Iexpect too much too soon.
Mr. Parsons: Well, you know journalism is a
highly competitive world, so you do need to
keep pushing yourself it’s true. Okay well lets
move on to talk about the job position here
shall we?
Rebecca: Yes please.
The Weekend ‐ Making Breakfast (C0254

A: Smells good! What’s for breakfast?

B: Well, since we are getting up so late, I
decided to make a big breakfast!

A: Nice! Brunch!

B: Kind of, so I made scrambled and soft
boiled eggs, some french toast and
buttermilk pancakes!

A: Wow! You really went all out! Did you
make any coffee?

B: Yeah, just the way you like it! I also put
out some cereal and muesli if you feel like
having something more light.

A: Looks good! I’ll squeeze us some fresh
orange juice.

B: Get the jam and butter while you are in

Global View ‐ The Miracle Of Life (C0255
)

A: Continuing with our class, today we are
going to study briefly the miracle of life.
Many of you may think you already know
how babies come to be, but I am sure that
some of the things that we will be talking
about today may surprise you. Billy can you
turn on the projector please? Thanks. Ok,
84
Englishpod Dialogues
does anyone know what this is?

B: Looks like a goat head to me!

A: Nice try, but this is a woman’s womb
which contains her uterus and ovaries. The
ovaries are packed with eggs and each
month during the middle of the menstrual
cycle, the ripest one will be sucked up by one
of the fallopian tubes. This is called ovulation
and the exact time of ovulation depends on
the length of your cycle. In an average 28
day cycle, ovulation will most likely happen
between the 12th and 15th days, counting
day 1 as the first day of your last period.

B: That’s amazing! So each month, the
woman produces these eggs and then waits
for them to be fertilized?

A: Actually, every woman is already born
with over four hundred thousand eggs! Some
will start dying off immediately and others
released during her fertile period.

B: What about the guys? I know they
produce sperm and stuff.

A: That’s right! The man’s body has a tiny
factory that produces sperm twenty four
hours a day! Each ejaculation will release
about a hundred million sperm so the factory
is always pretty busy. The sole purpose of a
sperm’s life is to fertilize the woman’s egg.

B: So, then we basically need to put oneand-
one together so we can have babies
right?

A: Yes, the man will have an orgasm during
intercourse and ejaculate sperm and semen.
Now this is where the race begins and all
those millions of sperm will race and swim
from the cervix, through the uterus to the
fallopian tubes. This could take anywhere
from forty five minutes to twelve hours! Not
all of them make it, since some go the wrong
way and get lost or simply die. Many will
actually reach the egg but only one will
penetrate it and fertilize it. Once this
happens, the egg instantly changes and
creates a protective shield once the sperm is
safely inside.

B: And then? That’s it?

A: Well, the egg will be fertilized within about
24 hours of its release. The genetic material
from the sperm combines with the genetic
material in the egg to create a new cell that
will rapidly start dividing. The woman is not
actually pregnant until that bundle of new
cells, known as the embryo, travels the rest
of the way down the fallopian tube and
attaches itself to the wall of her uterus. Any
other questions? Then let’s move on.
The Office ‐ Interview Skills 8 ‐ Discussi
ng Salary and Benefits (C0256)
Mr. Parsons: Okay, well I’m sure you have a
number of questions to ask me regarding the
position.
Rebecca: Yes, well Miss Childs did give me
an overview of the position over the phone,
but there were some details I’d like to clarify.
Mr. Parsons: Well feel free to ask me
anything, and I’ll try to fill in the details.
Rebecca: Could I first ask about the
remuneration package?
Mr. Parsons: Yes of course. That’s quite an
important point isn’t it? As a junior sub editor
we offer a starting salary of 150,000 HK
dollars per annum. This doesn’t include a
generous housing allowance also.
Rebecca: I understand. And are there other
bonuses included?
Mr. Parsons: Well apart from full health
insurance we do offer a company staff bonus
scheme linked to readership numbers. But
we could go through all the details of that at
a later date.
Rebecca: Well Mr. Parsons, I am flexible
when it comes to salary. The opportunity to
work in Hong Kong for you is the most

B: It’s only the day when the world’s biggest
sporting event is kicking off.

A: What?

B: The World Cup! The first match is today!
It’s Mexico vs. South Africa! It’s going to be a
really good match! Both teams have a very
strong offense and have skilled players. I
think that South Africa will probably
dominate the first half since they are the
host country, and all.

A: I have no idea what you’re talking about.
The only sporting event we watch at home is
the Super Bowl.

B: This is bigger than the Super Bowl, man!
Teams from 32 countries compete against
each other every four years and fight to win
that trophy. They first start in a group stage
with bigger groups, each group having 4
teams. The top 2 teams pass on to an
elimination stage before going on to the
quarterfinals and semifinals.

A: Sounds interesting, but soccer doesn’t
really appeal to me.

B: Are you kidding? Over seven hundred
million people watched the final match of the
World Cup! It’s a very exciting and nerve
wracking sport! Each nation is cheering on
their team, hoping they will become the next
champion. So far Brazil is the team with the
most titles under their belt; they’re really
good!

A: All I know about soccer is that you can’t
use your hands and that players are always
falling down, trying to get a free kick or
penalty kick. It seems like a sissy sport to
me!

B: Whatever dude, I’m going to go watch the

150 employees based in Hong Kong with
another 400 in our head office in Beijing. The
news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises
around 80 staff.
Rebecca: I see. And how about the working
hours?
Mr. Parsons: Well, as you know Rebecca, in
journalism work hours are not exactly 9-5.
You could be on call at any time. We do have
to work very unsociable hours at times.
Rebecca: Well I am used to that Mr.
Parsons, so that’s not really a shock for me.

B: Yeah it will be fun! I have a 9mm pistol
that is really easy to shoot. I also have a
revolver that’s really fun too! They have big
targets at the range that we could use to
practice and improve your aim.

A: Yeah that would be cool! Maybe I can also
have a try at other weapons like a machine
gun or a shotgun! Maybe even a rocket
launcher or an anti tank missile! Or what
about a flame thrower!

B: Whoa, take it easy there Rambo. Don’t
get carried away. These weapons are not
toys, and you must first learn how to handle
them properly. There are basic rules that you
must abide by in order to be safe. For
example, never handle a weapon that you
haven’t inspected yourself. Always make sure
there isn’t anything in the chamber, and
never put your finger on the trigger unless
you are ready to shoot!

A: Wow, I didn’t know! It always looks so
cool and easy in the movies!

B: The reality is different you know, running
and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in
the movies! So are you ready?

A: Hey! How was your first day of class? I’m
in level two and I’m loving my class this
semester! It’s great being in a class of
international students!

B: Mine was ok, except that no one in my
class speaks English. I guess it will force me
to converse in Chinese more in class so at
least I should improve a lot this semester.

A: That’s both fortunate and unfortunate. It’s
the United Nations in my class! We have
people from all over the world! There are
three Germans, a Pole, a Scottish, two
French, an American, a Brazilian, a Chilean, a
New Zealander, though he prefers to call
himself a Kiwi. Who else do we have? Oh, we
also have a Moroccan, a Togolese, a

B: That’s quite the array of nationalities.
Everyone in my class is from Asia, except
me. There are a few South Koreans, several
Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean,
Filipino, Kazakhstani, and one Russian.

A: Well, I think you’re pretty lucky actually.
You’ll have the opportunity to learn so much
about Asian culture.

B: I guess so, but I think it’s going to be
hard to relate to my classmates, especially
with the language barrier. I think I might
change classes.

A: Don’t! Stay the course! Your spoken
Chinese will be eternally grateful. I bet you it
will even surpass mine with all that practice.

B: I highly doubt it. Your girlfriend is
Chinese.

A: Well, there is that, yes.

A: What seems to be the problem?

B: I have a really bad toothache! My cheek is
swollen and I can’t eat anything.

A: Let’s have a look. Hmmm. This doesn’t
look too good. I think we may have to pull
out your wisdom tooth. It’s pressing against
your molars and that’s one of the reasons
you are experiencing so much pain.

B: When you pull my tooth will you also have
to extract the nerve and the root?

A: First we will take some x-rays and see
what we’re dealing with. I also noticed a
small cavity up front here, so you are going
to need a filling.

B: I guess that’s what I get for not flossing
or brushing my teeth three times a day.

A: It could be that, or maybe you are eating
too many sweets. In any case, I’ll administer
an anesthetic and you won’t feel a thing!
The Weekend ‐ Pest Control (C0265)

A: Hi, did you call for an exterminator?

B: Yes! Thank goodness you’re here. These
bugs are driving us crazy!

A: What sort of pest are we dealing with?

B: We just bought this house and it is
infected with just about everything. We have
termites in the wood, cockroaches all over
the place, and last night I saw a huge rat out
in the backyard!

A: Well, there’s nothing we can’t handle. I’ll
spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of
the cockroaches, but the termites will be
harder to get rid of. We will have to cover the
entire house and fumigate it. Unfortunately
that means you will have to find a place to
stay for the next three days.

B: No problem, just get rid of the bugs!
Daily Life ‐ Weather Report (C0266)

A: Those are today’s top stories. Now let’s go
to John for the weather. John, what does the
forecast look like for our weekend travelers?

B: I’m afraid we’re in for a rough weekend,
Mark. There is a storm system moving
through the East Coast. It will be drizzling all
day today, and there’s a 60 percent chance
of thunderstorms this evening. It will be
warm and humid all weekend. In the
Midwest, expect strong winds and a low of
around 40 degrees.

A: That’s pretty chilly for the summer! Will it
rain on Saturday?

B: Unfortunately, yes. It will be clear early
Saturday morning but there is a high chance
of showers and thunderstorms later in the
day. There is a severe thunderstorm warning
for some parts of the Southeast. Folks in
those areas might see some hail and
flooding, especially in areas that have been
experiencing record high rainfalls.

A: That certainly sounds like a dreary
Saturday.

B: It gets better on Sunday, though. The
storm systems move east and the skies will
clear up at night. It will still be rather cool,
with highs in the low 50s. The West Coast
will be experiencing some unusually chilly
weather, but at least the sun will come out. I
advise weekend travelers to be careful,
especially while driving. Back to you, Mark.

B: No. I’ve never made a transfer before.

suitable replacement.

A: Well, rest assured that you can count on
us to be here for the long run sit down.
Coffee?

B: No, thanks. I’ve been trying to cut down
on the caffeine .

A: Haha, I could never do that. I’d be a
zombie if I didn’t have my morning coffee fix.
Let’s get down to business then.

B: Yes. I’ve come to talk with you about
ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our
new MePhone. The demand for phone
cameras is growing, and Pear has been
falling behind in the market.

A: That’s great! I’m glad to hear that Pear
has finally jumped on the bandwagon. Right
now our contract is for the five megapixel
cameras. Is Pear still interested in having
those?

B: No, we’re changing all the cameras to
eight megapixels. We were hoping that by
making your company our sole supplier for
cameras we could negotiate a better deal.

A: Surely. Let’s get started by drafting a new
contract.
The Office ‐ Marketing Plan (C0269)

A: Okay everyone, let’s begin. I called you
here today to evaluate our marketing
strategy during this recession. I wanted to
re-emphasize our corporate mission of
Aiming to give our customers the best coffee
and service in a clean and welcoming
atmosphere.

B: Several other shops have reduced the
prices for their coffees and are drawing in
more customers. Why aren’t we doing the
same thing?

A: I know that recent sales have been slow,
but we are not going to reduce our prices to
the level of our competitors. We offer a
superior product and our focus is on longterm
growth rather than shortterm sales. If
we lower our prices, we run the risk of
devaluing our product.

B: Customers don’t care about the coffee
anymore. They only care about the price.

A: I disagree. Highly discerning customers
know that our coffee is far better than the
coffee you buy at the other places. Our
coffee bean are artisan roasted and we use
state-of-the-art equipment to brew our
coffees. When you compare the coffees sideby-
side our coffee wins the taste test every
time. We have never sought to appeal to the
mass market with cheap coffee drinks, and
we will not do so now.

C: That’s true. We’ve certainly achieved top
89
Englishpod Dialogues
of mind awareness when it comes to the best
best tasting brews and it’s important to
distinguish ourselves from our competitors. I
think the main question is how we can show
our appreciation to our customers.

A: That’s the main question I would like to
discuss today.

B: Money is tight for everyone these days so
even our most loyal customers may be
reconsidering the money they pay for their
morning coffee. Since the superiority of our
coffee beans is one of our core competencies
why don’t we sell the beans for people to
brew coffee at home.

C: That could definitely be a way we could
expand our company, but would we be
undermining the essence of the company
that way?

A: Let’s brainstorm some more ideas, and do
some research. The customer always comes
first, and what the customer wants, the
customer gets. Maybe it’s time we started
selling coffee beans.
Daily Life ‐ Buying A Suit (C0270)

A: Hello sir, what can I do for you today?

B: Hi, I need a new suit. I have an important
interview next week, so I really need to look
sharp.

A: No problem! We have a broad selection of
suits, all tailored made so that it will fit
perfectly.

B: Great! I want a three piece suit,
preferably made from Italian cashmere or
wool.

A: Very well sir. Would you like to have some
shirts made also?

B: Sure. I’ll also take some silver cuff link
and a pair of silk ties.

A: Very good. Now, if you will accompany
me, we can take your measurements and
choose the patterns for your suit and shirts.
The Office ‐ Presentation Series 1 ‐ The
Overview and the Agenda (C0271)

A: Hi everyone, Can everyone hear me?Can
you guys at the back hear everything?

A: Okay great. Well I think all of you know
why we are here this afternoon. As most of
you are aware 2010 marks an important
moment for Alpha computers.

A: We have bounced back from the recession
and now we are set to launch our new line of
laptop and desktop computers.

A: I’m really pleased to welcome Michael
Ford, the Global Marketing Manager for Alpha
computers, who has flown in from California
to give all of you an overview of the
marketing campaign and to answer any
questions you may have. So please give a
warm welcome to Mr. Ford.

B: Thank you Jonathan. It really is a
pleasure to be here today. It has been three
years since I visited Beijing ,and it’s clear to
me that operations here are obviously going
from strength to strength.

B: The Alpha brand continues to grow in
leaps and bounds in China, and that is
certainly down to the hard work of all of you
here. So congratulations to all of you.

B: I’d like to start by outlining the key points
of my presentation this afternoon and giving
you an idea of the topics that will be
discussed. The presentation today is divided
into five main parts.

B: First of all, I’d like to briefly touch on the
background of the new x420 line; how the
whole concept has come about and how the
new product fits into our existing brand line.

B: Secondly I’dlike to present data on
projected sales for the x420. We will then go
on to discuss our key rivals in this sector.
Then I would like to go on to outline the
campaign concept for the x420.

B: Finally I’m happy to open up the
discussion for any questions or points you
might have for me.
Daily Life ‐ Getting A Nanny (C0272)
Grace: Hey Mel! Are you up for some tennis
today?
Mel: Sorry, I can’t! I have to go to work, pick
up Jake and Maddie from school, and make
them an afternoon snack, then take Jake to
90
Englishpod Dialogues
soccer practice and Maddie to dance class.
Grace: You sound exhausted. Maybe you
should hire a nanny to help you out! She can
pick the kids up and take them to their afterschool
activities. She can also help you do
some household chores, and run some
errands.
Mel: Oh, I don’t know... it’s hard to find the
right nanny .You have to consider her
previous work experience, the responsibilities
you give her, and how she interacts with the
kids. I would love to have someone to help
me out, though.
Grace: I think you should definitely consider
it! This way you won’t have to juggle such a
busy schedule, and you’ll still get to spend
time with the kids in the evenings. I can
refer you this great nanny Amy. She used to
work for my neighbors, before they moved
away. She’s very responsible, a good cook,
and great with kids.
Mel: Oh, that’s great. Thanks Grace. Can you
give me her number? I’ll talk it over with Dan
and give her a call tomorrow. Maybe this way
I won’t be so tired every day, and Dan and I
might even get to go on a date once in a
while .
The Weekend ‐ The Zodiac and Horoscop
es (C0273)
Angela: Hey Lydia, what are you reading?
Lydia: I’m looking at my horoscope for this
month! My outlook is very positive. It says
that I should take a vacation to someplace
exotic, and that I will have a passionate
summer fling!
Angela: What are you talking about? Let me
see that. . . What are horoscopes?
Lydia: It’s a prediction of your month, based
on your zodiac sign . You have a different
sign for the month and date you were born
in. I was born on April 15th, so I’m an Aries.
When were you born?
Angela: January 5th.
Lydia: Let’s see. . . you’re a Capricorn. It
says that you will be feeling stress at work,
but you could see new, exciting
developments in your love life . Looks like
we’ll both have interesting summers!
Angela: That’s bogus. I don’t feel any stress
at work, and my love life is practically
nonexistent. This zodiac stuff is all a bunch
of nonsense.
Lydia: No it’s not, your astrology sign can
tell you a lot about your personality. See? It
says that an Aries is energetic and loves to
socialize. Angela: Well, you certainly match
those criteria, but they’re so broad they
could apply to anyone. What does it say
about me?
Lydia: A Capricorn is serious-minded and
practical. She likes to do things in
conventional ways. * laughs * That sounds
just like you!
The Office ‐ Presentation Series 2 ‐ Talki
ng about numbers, charts and graphs (
C0274)
Mr Ford: As all of you are well aware,
competition in the laptop computer sector is
intense.
Mr Ford: We continue to fight with our
competitors for market share, and this is the
case both in the developed markets in the
West, as well as more developing markets in
Asia and Africa.
Mr Ford: You may ask yourself, why is this
market so cut-throat? Well the answer is
simple. There is a huge untapped potential
market out there, with a huge untapped
potential for profit.
Mr Ford: If I bring up the first graph here, it
shows the increase in terms of number of
computer owners across the globe.
Mr Ford: As you can see in the 1980’s
computer ownership amounted to around
0.5% of the total world population. Since the
1990’s, computer ownership has risen
dramatically.
Mr Ford: In the new millennium we saw an
even larger explosion in computer owners ,
91
Englishpod Dialogues
with figures rising to around 4- 5%, an
increase of 1000 % percent compared with
the 1980’s .
Mr Ford: If we move on to discuss the
figures for China specifically we can see in
Chart B that the overall figure for computer
ownership stands at around 60 million, which
represents a huge increase in a very short
time period.
Mr Ford: Now of course 60 million is just a
drop in the ocean if you compare the total
population of China, and this is a key reason
why the personal computer market is such a
hot market.
Mr Ford: For us at Alpha, and of course for
all our competitors as well, we have millions
of potential customers who are looking to
join the internet generation.
Mr Ford: If we do this right we really can
reap huge rewards in a very short time
frame. I’d now like to move on to discuss the
x420 brand itself, and compare and contrast
with some of our key competitors.
Daily Life ‐ Kitchen Appliances (C0275)

A: I have been looking at this online catalog
for over an hour and I still haven’t finished
getting all the kitchen appliances that we
need!

B: What are you getting?

A: Well, the first thing on my list is a new
blender. I decided to also get a juicer and a
new coffee maker.

B: Don’t forget to also get a new mixer. I
lent the old one to my brother and he broke
it.

A: Yeah I know. I also decided to throw away
the old toaster and get a new one. I am also
getting a rice cooker and steamer to make
some nice steamed fish or veggies.

B: I’m actually thinking of completely
refurnishing the kitchen and getting a new
stove, oven, dishwasher and trash
compacter.

A: That’s a good idea ! The kitchen will look
amazing!
Daily Life ‐ Telephone Services (C0276)

A: Telco Mobile, how can I help you?

B: Yes, I’d like to activate my voice mail
service please.

A: Certainly sir, we currently have a special
promotion where we include voice mail
services, call waiting and also three way
calling.

B: Sure that sounds great! Are there any
other fees?

A: Not at all. No hidden fees or surcharges, it
is a flat monthly rate.

B: Perfect. I also wanted to know if there is
any call forwarding service? I am usually out
of town and would like my calls to be
forwarded to a local number.

A: Yes of course. We can activate all these
services in about an hour.
The Office ‐ Presentation Series 3 ‐ Maki
ng Comparisons (C0277)
Mr. Ford: Now a key question you might ask
yourself is what differentiates the new x420
line with our previous models, and also of
course with some of our competitors.
Mr. Ford: In other words what makes the
x420 stand out from all the others? This is a
key question, and is something I’d like to
explore in a little depth. Firstly, the x420 has
a range of USPs that really make it a cut
above the rest.
Mr. Ford: The first thing to mention is that
the x420 is the first in a new generation of
ultralight laptop computers. It is only 2lbs,
which compares very favorably with all our
key competitors. In terms of computer
performance, for such a light machine it’s
very powerful. 4Gb of RAM, with an ultra-fast
processor.
Mr. Ford: The most advanced video and
sound cards on the market are installed with
a crystal-clear 15-inch LCD display. The x420
really stands out as next generation laptop.
Compared with our previous x540 range it
really is in a league of its own .
Mr. Ford: Now, if we go on to look at
92
Englishpod Dialogues
projected sales for the x420 we can see that
sales revenue for 2010 is expected to hit at
least 20 million dollars. Now this is really a
conservative estimate.
Mr. Ford: If our marketing campaign is
successful I’m confident that we could see a
doubling of this figure at the very least. Now
please bear in mind that this is only for the
first year of production.
Mr. Ford: I’m certain that in the coming
three years the x420 will actually overtake all
our existing products, both in terms of sales
and revenue. Okay, now let’s move on to
discuss our marketing concept and look more
closely at our key competitors.
Global View ‐ At The Car Dealership (C02
78)

A: Hi there! I am looking for a new car. I
have this old Ford Pinto that I would like to
trade in.

B: I see. You are in luck this month because
all of our models are on sale! it is a perfect
time to buy a new car since it’s the end of
the year,

A: Perfect! I like this one.

B: That is the Ford Focus. A very light but
powerful vehicle. It comes with dual side
airbags, power steering and power windows,
tinted windows and your choice of either
automatic or manual transmission.

A: Sounds like a good car! How many miles
to the gallon?

B: It is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you
about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the
highway.

A: That is really convenient. Especially now
that fuel prices are so high! What’s under the
hood?

B: A very powerful 2.5-liter turbocharged
engine, Trust me, this car is fast!

A: Now for the most difficult question. What
is the price tag for this lovely vehicle?

B: Very affordable sir. You can take it out of
this lot today with 0% down payment and no
interest for the first year! You can test drive
it now and we can sign the papers when we
get back.

A: Great! Let’s do it!
Global View ‐ Drugs (C0279)

A: Hey man, you wanna buy some weed?

B: Some what?

A: Weed! You know? Pot, Ganja, Mary Jane
some chronic!

B: Oh, umm, no thanks.

A: I also have blow if you prefer to do a few
lines.

B: No, I am ok, really.

A: Come on man! I even got dope and acid!
Try some!

B: Do you really have all of these drugs?
Where do you get them from?

A: I got my connections! Just tell me what
you want and I’ll even give you one ounce
for free.

B: Sounds good! Let’s see, I want.

A: Yeah?

B: I want you to put your hands behind your
head! You are under arrest!
The Office ‐ Presentation Series 4 ‐ Discu
ssing the
Competition (C0280)
Mr. Ford: Now, of course, with all this
cutting-edge technology there must be a
catch, you might ask yourself. I bet the retail
price will be too much for most consumers,
you might say. Well, you’d be wrong!
Mr. Ford: Yes, of course the x420 is aimed
at the luxury market, but if you compare the
price of our leading competitors, the x420
represents incredible value for money. At
only15,000RMB it is far more affordable and
far more attractive than almost every leading
brand and model.
Mr. Ford: So, what differentiates us from
our competitors? Well, if we compare
Orange’s luxury MP40 range then we can
really highlight some of the differences.
Mr. Ford: Now, of course Orange has an
enviable record for producing revolutionary
93
Englishpod Dialogues
and top class products, and I must admit the
MP40 is a breathtaking machine. However,
for most consumers the MP40 is simply far
too expensive to consider.
Mr. Ford: Compared with the x420 it is more
expensive and there’s no doubt that
considering the quality and workmanship
that goes into the x420 we really win hands
down on value for money.
Mr. Ford: Also, if you compare the after
sales service we offer I think we can proudly
boast the best customer service facilities in
the whole lap-top sector. As opposed to most
of our rivals, we guarantee quality, we
guarantee service and we guarantee
reliability.
Mr. Ford: The questions we must ask
ourselves are ” What does the Alpha brand
stand for? and also ” How can we set
ourselves apart from our competitors? The
answer to both of these questions is the
same my friends.
Mr. Ford: Alpha stands first and foremost for
quality, for excellence and for service. If we
always stick to this philosophy then I’m
confident that we will really be able to
expand our market share significantly. Okay,
let me move on now to give you an idea of
our marketing campaign for the x420
The Weekend ‐ Breaking Up (C0281)
Lydia: Hello?
Maggie: Hey! Do you want to go out
tonight?
Lydia: No, I think I’ll pass. Mark broke up
with me. I feel awful.
Maggie: What?!? What happened? Just last
week you were talking about going on
vacation together!
Lydia: I don’t know what I did wrong. He
said he needed some space to figure things
out... He said I didn’t do anything wrong,
that I’m a great person... just not the one for
him...
Maggie: Ugh! That’s so cliche. Mark’s not
worth your time, Lydia. You deserve so much
better!
Lydia: I know we had hit a rough patch but I
had hoped we could work it out next
weekend, when we both had some time off...
I think he found someone else. I had been
getting suspicious because he had been
spending a lot of time with a coworker...
Maggie: Whatever. He’s a jerk, forget about
him! There are many more fish in the sea.
Lydia: Talk about being clich ′ e, Maggie! But
you’re right. There’s no use for me to sulk
around... Let’s go out tonight!
Global View ‐ Physics (C0282)
Prof. Brown: Good morning, everybody.
Welcome to Physics 101. My name is Ed
Brown, and I will be your professor for this
semester. Since today is our first class, I
wanted to give you an overview of what this
course will look like, how you will be graded,
and what we will cover this semester.
Matt: Will we be focusing more on
theoretical physics or experimental physics,
Professor?
Prof. Brown: This is an introductory course,
and my aim is to give you a broad overview
of the field of physics. The term “ physics”
encompasses many different areas of
research and study, and I hope this course
will provide you with conceptual
understanding of physics, which will prove
useful whether or not you choose to further
your study in this field.
Prof. Brown: We will begin the course by
looking at the fundamental concepts of
physics, then by the middle of the semester
we will begin exploring the more theoretical
side of physics. It is essential that you first
have a firm grasp of the fundamentals, so
that you can better understand the
theoretical concepts when we get to them.
Matt: Will we learn about black holes,
wormholes, and string theory?
Prof. Brown: We will learn about the
general theory of relativity, including black
holes. We will also explore developing
theories in quantum mechanics, such as
string theory. We will discuss some
94
Englishpod Dialogues
hypothetical features of space-time, like
wormholes.
Prof. Brown: We will also explore some of
the more influential developments in the
fields of thermodynamics, electromagnetism,
and nuclear physics, all of which have had
significant impacts on modern life. Now, I am
going to have the TAs pass out the syllabus
for this class, so you can see how this course
will be graded.
Matt: Oh man, looks like this isn’t gonna be
the easy A I thought it’d be!
The Office ‐ Presentation Series 5 ‐ Defer
ring Questions (C0283)
Mr. Ford: Now, as we have already
discussed there is a huge untapped market
out there both in Asia, in other developing
markets, and in the more mature markets for
us to push into. Now of course, this
represents an enormous challenge with
enormous rewards for the winners, but for
any new product we need a great marketing
message and marketing campaign
Mr. Ford: It needs to be directed and
focused at our target consumer, and needs to
be pitched at exactly the right level. The
question we must first address is of course,
who is our target consumer and secondly
what do they expect from the next
generation Alpha lap-top?
Mr. Ford: Let’s first of all tackle the first
question. Our target consumer for the x420
is the middle class, white collar worker with
an above average income. However, as we
mentioned before the total number of
computer owners is expanding rapidly and
we need to broaden our audience for this
product.
Mr. Ford: For example, the x420 is also
ideally suited to the younger student sector,
who might use laptops both for study and
gaming. There is no doubt that.
Audience Member: Mr. Ford, if I could just
interrupt a moment. You say that the
computer is suitable for students, but don’t
you think the price of the x420 is just too
much for most students?
Mr Ford: Well, that’s a fair point. If you
don’t mind I’d like to tackle your question a
little bit later in the Q and A section. Is that
okay?
Audience Member: Yes sure.
Mr Ford: Okay, so as I was saying we have
an exciting campaign planned for the x420.
Firstly, we will have a nationwide television
campaign, as well as advertising on radio
and also in many computer publications. We
also intend to.
Audience Member: I’m sorry to stop you
Mr. Ford, but do you really think that a
television campaign is cost effective. I mean,
how much is that going to cost?
Mr Ford: Well I don’t have the figures to
hand, but I’d be happy to discuss those
figures with you after the presentation. Okay
let me just go on to talk a little more about
the exciting campaign we have in store.
Daily Life ‐ Tune Up (C0284)

A: Welcome to Al’s Garage. What seems to
be the problem?

B: No problem at all! I am taking a long road
trip and I want to make sure my car is in
good mechanical condition.

A: Very wise decision. When was the last
time you had a tune up?

B: Not that long ago, I think it was four
months ago.

A: We usually recommend that you bring
your car in every five thousand kilometers.

B: Why? I mean, what exactly do you do to a
car that you need to check it so often?

A: First of all, we change the motor oil and
oil filter. If you don’t do this, it can cause
your engine to wear faster and that means
you would probably have to change the
pistons and intake valves.

B: I see. What else?

A: We also check your spark plugs, fuel filter,
and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid.
We also check the clutch and brakes to
determine when you will need new ones.

B: Ok, well, when you put it that way, it
95
Englishpod Dialogues
doesn’t seem like a waste of time and
money.

A: Trust me, regular tune ups will keep your
car running smoothly and avoid break
downs.
Daily Life ‐ Handyman (C0285)

A: The air conditioning is not working! We
need to call a handyman before we start to
fry in here!

B: Dan is on top of that. I think they are also
getting the handyman to fix the bathroom
toilet that keeps clogging up.

A: That would be convenient. They might as
well ask him to fix the electrical wiring. The
circuit breakers keep going out all the time.
It’s really annoying!

B: Yeah you are right. This office is falling
apart! Frank told me the other day that the
gutters outside were clogged and that’s why
the parking lot was flooded.

A: I know! I was in ankle deep water trying
to get to my car that day! The handyman
definitely has his work cut out for him.
The Office ‐ Presentation Series 6 ‐ Addr
essing the Audience (C0286)
Mr. Ford: The campaign that we have in
store for the x420 is exciting, imaginative
and revolutionary. We have spent two years
listening to and responding to feedback from
customers and staff alike.
Mr. Ford: I would like to say that without
the assistance and support of each and every
one of you we really could not have devised
this campaign. I’d like to take my hat off and
really thank you all for the wonderful work
you’ve done so far, not only in helping
support our marketing efforts, but also in
your continuing your commitment to Alpha
computers.
Mr. Ford: There’s no doubt in my mind that
we have a great workforce here and together
we can really push Alpha computers to a
whole new level of success.
Mr. Ford: On the subject of the campaign let
me ask you all a question. How do we define
the perfect lap-top? Is it about affordability,
quality, speed, reliability? What do you look
for in a consumer? Well, I believe the answer
lies in a combination of all of these elements.
Mr. Ford: Our campaign will really hammer
home the point that the x420 is a stateofthe-
art laptop for all of your computing
needs. With our television campaign we hope
to really reach out to a huge audience. Mr.
Ford: We have a great ad campaign planned
focusing on the fantastic USP’ s of the x420.
We have hired one of the best PR companies
to work with us on the campaign, and have
already completed three separate TV
adverts, all focusing on one key feature of
the x420.
Mr. Ford: I’m excited to say that today, for
the first time, we will unveil to all of you here
the first of these advertisements!
Daily Life ‐ High School Reunion (C0287)

A: I hate coming to high school reunions.

B: It will be great honey. We will get to see
your old classmates and catch up to see how
they have been doing.

A: Yeah I guess so. Oh look! There is Robert
Matthews! Rob!

C: Hey Bill! Wow great to see you!

A: Likewise! It’s been a long time! This is my
wife Dorthy.

C: Pleasure to meet you. So Bill, how have
you been?

A: Can’t complain! We have 2 children who
are in college and my business is going well.
What about you?

C: Ah you know me! I am a dedicated
bachelor. I never married although I do have
a beautiful daughter with Mary, you
remember her? We were high school
sweetheart, didn’t really work out between
us, but I really can’t complain either.

A: That’s good. Have you seen Frank? I was
hoping he would come tonight.

C: You didn’t hear? Frank passed away last
96
Englishpod Dialogues
year.

A: Are you serious?

C: Nah! I’m just yanking your chain. He’ll be
here soon. I saw him just last week and he
told me he would show up.
The Weekend ‐ Getting A Tattoo (C0288)

A: I have made up my mind. I am getting a
tattoo.

B: Really? Are you sure?

A: Yeah! Why not? They are trendy and look
great! I want to get a dragon on my arm or
maybe a tiger on my back.

B: Yeah but, it is something that you will
have forever! They use indelible ink that can
only be removed with laser treatment. On
top of all that, I have heard it hurts a lot!

A: Really?

B: Of course! They use this machine with a
needle that pokes your skin and inserts the
ink.

A: Oh, I didn’t know that! I thought they just
paint it on your skin or something.

B: I think you should reconsider and do
some more research about tattoos. Also, find
out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and
make sure they used sterilized needles, and
that the place is hygienic.

A: Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing!
The Office ‐ Presentation Series 7 ‐ Hand
ling Technical Problems (C0289)
Mr. Ford: Okay, so if we could dim the lights
Jonathan, we can kick-off with the first TV
advert. Please note that we are still in the
early days with this advert, so it might seem
a bit rough round the edges. Okay, so. just
need to click this and the advert should pop
up on the screen...
Mr. Ford: Hmmmmmm. Sorry about this.
Bear with me me a second. There seems to
be a problem with the projector. Let me see.
could you lend a hand a second? Jonathan:
It looks like the projector is not recognizing
the computer. Let me check the connection a
second... Well the connection seems okay,
and the computer is running normally.
Mr. Ford: Okay. Sorry guys. Obviously a
problem with the system. Let’s just reboot
and start over. Let’s see if this resolves the
issue.
Jonathan: Right, let’s try again. No, still
nothing Michael. There might be a technical
issue with the projector. I think maybe the
projector has overheated. We might need to
cool it down for ten minutes and start again.
I’ll call IT support to come over right now.
Mr. Ford: Okay guys. Unfortunately
technical problems do crop up from time to
time, don’t they? But it’s not a huge
problem. In the meantime while the IT guys
get to work on that I can talk a little bit more
about the advertising concept and what we
are looking to achieve overall with this
campaign.
The Weekend ‐ Buying Jewelery (C0290)
Shop assistant: Good afternoon, sir, is
there anything I can help you with today?
Mark: umm... yeah! I’m looking for a nice
gift to give my girlfriend. Our fifth
anniversary’s next Friday. Shop assistant:
Well, I would be happy to assist you in
choosing the perfect gift for her. Is there
anything particular that you have in mind?
Mark: No, not really... I’m completely at a
loss.
Shop assistant: Well, you can give her a set
of pearl earrings, or this beautiful heartshaped
pendant. What is her favorite
gemstone?
Mark: That purple one. I’m sorry...I’ve never
bought jewelery for anyone and I’m kind of
nervous.
Shop assistant: Don’t worry, we specialize
in providing our customers a relaxed,
pressure-free shopping environment. That
stone is an amethyst. We have a range of
beautiful amethyst pieces. Take a look at this
bracelet. It’s 18K rose-gold, studded with
amethyst and blue topaz. It’s a great
statement piece.
97
Englishpod Dialogues
Mark: Oh...wow. That’s really pretty. Jess
would love that. But...I was thinking of
something a little more delicate, perhaps a
necklace?
Shop assistant: We have this beautiful
platinum pendant, or you could also get her
a locket. You could also get her a
timepiece—it’s both glamorous yet
functional. If you tell me a little more about
your girlfriend, maybe I can help
you find something for her. Mark: Jess? Well,
she’s very smart, and has a great sense of
humor. She’s very feminine...
Shop assistant: Perhaps you could give her
a ring?
Mark: Well...actually...I was thinking about
asking Jess to marry me...I’ve just been so
nervous.
Shop assistant: Well sir, I believe your fifth
anniversary is a great time to propose!
Mark: Okay, I’ve decided. I’m going to pop
the question!
Shop assistant: Fabulous! We should look at
engagement rings then! Now that’s a whole
other section.
Daily Life ‐ Ordering Chinese Food (C029
1)
Waitress: Hi, welcome to Happy Buddah!
Can I get you anything to drink?
Manny: A Coke for me, please.
Andrea: I’ll have a Sprite.
Waitress: Okay, I’ll go get that for you. Are
there any questions with the menu?
Andrea: Do you use MSG?
Waitress: No ma’am, we are MSG-free.
Andrea: Oh man, I haven’t had Chinese food
in so long! I want everything! This place has
the BEST sesame chicken.
Manny: Yeah, I’ve been craving Chinese for
such a long time. I used to get take-out all
the time. It’s definitely been a while. Let’s
start off with some crab rangoon.
Andrea: Ooh yeah, that sounds good. I think
I’m going to get the sesame chicken with
fried rice, a spring roll, and egg drop soup.
Manny: It’s so tempting to order everything
on the menu, it all looks so appetizing! I
think I’ll get General Tso’s chicken, hot and
sour soup, fried wontons, and white rice.
Andrea: Aren’t you supposed to be on a
diet? You should at least get brown rice.
Manny: I don’t think so! I hate brown rice,
and I’m so sick of eating healthy all the time.
I’ve been eating so much salad I swear I’ve
forgotten what meat tastes like! There’s no
better remedy than some nice, greasy,
calorieladen Chinese food. I might even get
an order of broccoli beef!
Andrea: Gosh, I’m so hungry! Let’s call the
waitress over!
The Office ‐ Presentation Series 8 ‐ Com
mon Presentation Mistakes (C0292)
Mr. Ford: So as I mentioned previously the
campaign advertisement will focus on those
key elements that every consumer looks for
in a quality laptop: affordability, quality,
speed and reliability. We have pulled out all
the stops to produce a product that really
rivals all our competitors.
Mr. Ford: Actually, just to illustrate my point
let me give you an anecdote here. I
remember last year I was playing golf with
one of our key suppliers. It was a lovely
summer afternoon. Anyway, I invited our
supplier for a game of golf, and wanted to
get his input on the new x420.
Mr. Ford: Actually, I often get together with
him for a good game of golf. It really is a
wonderful way to relax. To be honest, I’m not
that great at golf, but I have improved in the
last few years. But the key to golf is practice,
practice, practice. I’ve lost my thread. What
was I talking about again?
Jonathan: I think you were discussing the
campaign advertisement Michael.
Mr. Ford: Yes, excuse me. I’m afraid I got
sidetracked there. Yes anyway, the
campaign. Well, erm. let me see. Is the
projector working yet Jonathan?
Jonathan: No sorry, IT are still fixing it.
Mr. Ford: Ahh okay, erm... all the
information on the campaign is on the
98
Englishpod Dialogues
PowerPoint. I haven’t actually got my notes
with me...ermlet me see, erm.....
Audience Member: Mr. Ford, could you at
least tell us the schedule for the campaign?
When are the first advertisements scheduled
for?
Mr. Ford: That’s a good question.
Unfortunately I erm...don’t have that
information on me. I will have to get back to
you on that point.
Jonathan: Okay Michael, the projector is
fixed. I think we’re ready.
Mr. Ford: Thank goodness. Okay everyone,
sorry for the delay. So without further ado
the new x420 marketing campaign! Enjoy!
oh ermmm. I’m terribly sorry, this is not the
advert, this is my golfing holiday in
Barbados. I think I must have brought the
wrong file. Can we take five?
Advanced Media ‐ Cheese Lovers (F0293
)

A: Hello everyone my name is Laurie and I
want to welcome you to this course. We will
learn all about one of the oldest yet most
delicious foods on this planet; cheese! Let’s
get started!

A: Cheese is usually categorized intofour
types: soft, semi- soft semi-hard and hard.
The designation refers to the amount of
moisture in the cheese, which directly affects
its texture. Making cheese is an ancient
practice, dating back thousands of years, and
the home cheese maker can usually find
recipes for cheese that falls into any of the
four categories.

A: Soft cheese includes cottage cheese,
cream cheese, ricotta, brie, bleu, roquefort,
mozzarella, meunster and similar cheeses.
These cheeses generally pair well with fruit
or meats, or can be used as breakfast
cheeses in an omelette Nor as pasta fillings.
They are usually mildly flavored and very
high in moisture.

A: American, Colby, co-jack and similar
cheeses are inthe semi-soft category. These
are slightly stronger in flavor and cover a
wide range of uses. Co-jack cheese, a blend
of Colby and Monterrey jack is one of the
most popular. This allows the sharper flavor
of Colby to be combined with the milder jack
cheese, and also melts better than plain
Colby. Grilled cheese sandwiches often use
American cheese, and Mexican cheeses such
as Asadero and Queso Fresco are becoming
more popular.

A: Hard cheeses include Parmesan, Romano,
Asiago, Swiss, Gruyere and others. Parmesan
and Romano are most familiar as the grated
powder used to top spaghetti, but they are
also used as accompaniments for fruit, wine,
nuts and other appetizer items. Swiss is a
popular sandwich cheese and melts well,
unlike some other hard cheeses.
Daily Life ‐ Picking A University (C0294)

A: I’ve never heard of AmLion College. Could
you...

B: Of course sir, let me give you a brief
overview. AmLion College is located in the
center of New York city. The school covers a
wide range of academic subjects; and eighty
percent of the courses are transferable to
other state universities. And, last year
AmLion College was ranked number one in
terms of graduate employment.

A: Interesting, and what about the tuition
fees, then?

B: You’ll be looking at somewhere around
fifteen thousand US dollars per semester.

A: Okay, well.

B: And, did I mention our on-campus
housing? Students can stay in our newly
renovated dorms for as little as three
thousand dollars per month!

A: Sounds good. Well. I’ll just grab one of
your flyers.

B: Sir, you got the wrong flyer. Sir, sir!
The Office ‐ Presentation Series 9 ‐ Sum
mary and
Conclusion (C0295)
Mr. Ford: Right everyone. I apologize that I
can’t show you the marketing campaign
today, but next week you will all have the
99
Englishpod Dialogues
opportunity to see if for yourselves, and I
have no doubt that you will be impressed.
Let me wrap up the presentation by
summarising my key points.
Mr. Ford: As I mentioned at the outset,
2010 represents a key year for Alpha
computers. The recession is hopefully behind
us. It is clear to everyone in the computer
industry that demand is booming, especially
in the developing markets.
Mr. Ford: If we are to succeed in this
ultracompetitive field then we really need to
push forward and offer our customers
products that meet their needs on all levels.
As I hope I have illustrated, the x420
represents the kind of computer that can
really satisfy those needs.
Mr. Ford: I gave you an idea of the kind of
revenue we expect to hit in 2010 with the
new x420 range, and believe me, this is
really just the beginning. Once we establish
the x420 in the market we have plans to
continue to expand our range with ever more
revolutionary and impressive products.
Mr. Ford: Alpha computers is dedicated to
innovation and improvement. I really see no
limit to our potential as long as we stick to
the principles I stressed earlier: quality,
excellence and service.
Mr. Ford: Before we move on to the Q and A
section I’d really like to leave you with a
quote that really sums up everything that
we’ve discussed today, and hopefully it will
provide you with the same inspiration that it
gives me.
Mr. Ford: As the great Henry Ford once said
” Quality means doing it right, when no one
is looking” Well, in fact our customers are
looking; they are looking for
us to lead the way and to give them the
quality that our competitors cannot. We
cannot let them down!
Global View ‐ Vegan Or Vegetarian? (C02
96)

A: Hey Julie, you want to go grab something
to eat?

B: Sure! What do you feel like having?

A: I really feel like having a big juicy steak!

B: Oh. ok. I don’t eat meat, but that’s fine, I
am sure wherever we are going they will
have other options right?

A: I didn’t know you were a vegetarian!

B: I’m not, I am a vegan.

A: A what?

B: A vegan. I don’t eat or use any animal
based products. I don’t wear leather, eat
eggs, drink milk or anything that comes from
an animal. I used to be a pescatarian before,
which basically means you don’t eat meat,
but still have fish and seafood.

A: Wow! That’s interesting! It must be tough!

B: It’s a bit difficult to find vegetarian
friendly restaurants sometimes, but since
more and more people are vegetarians or
vegans nowadays, it’s getting a bit less
difficult.
The Weekend ‐ Ordering At An Italian Re
staurant (C0297)

A: Good evening ladies. My name is Josh and
I’ll be your server tonight. May I take your
order?

B: Do you have any recommendations?

A: Well, I personally like the chicken penne
with cream mushroom sauce, but the prawn
fettuccine is also very nice.

B: Hmm. I’d like to have the grilled chicken,
but can I have spaghetti instead of penne?

A: Of course, mam. And for you?

C: I... ah..I’ll have the horse tripe.
The Office ‐ Presentation Series 10 ‐ The
Q and A
Session (C0298)
Jonathan: Well everyone, I’m sure you’d
like to join me in thanking Michael for what
was a really inspirational presentation.
Sincere thanks
Michael. Jonathan: Now, I’m sure many of
you will be keen to ask some questions, so
100
Englishpod Dialogues
I’d like to open it up a Q and A session.
Please raise your hand if you have any
questions at all. Janice, go ahead.
Janice: Yes thank you Jonathan. I would just
like to go back to the comment Mr. Ford
made in regards to our competitors,
particularly Orange. Now as you know,
Orange has established themselves as the
market leader in the high-end lap-top
market.
Janice: How does Mr. Ford expect to
compete with a company that has such a
huge reputation and huge resources?
Mr. Ford: Well Janice, first of all, thanks for
a very good question. I think you have hit
the nail on the head actually. Orange are the
global leaders precisely because of their size
and power.
Mr. Ford: But, although we can’t compete in
terms of size I do believe we hold an
advantage in terms of dedication to customer
service. Yes, I admit this is a David and
Goliath battle,but don’t forget who won that
contest.
Frank: Ermmm, Mr Ford. Could you
elaborate on the actual technical details of
the x420 a little more?
Mr. Ford: I’d love to but I think we are a
little pressed for time right now. However
Jonathan has all the technical specs for you
on the powerpoint presentation, which you
can look over in your own time.
Marcie: Mr. Ford. One final question. Would
you like to join me for a game of golf this
Sunday?
Daily Life ‐ Returning A Product (C0299)

A: Hi I would like to return this TV.

B: Sure, do you have the receipt?

A: Yeah here you go. Actually I also want to
return this keyboard.

B: Ok, may I ask what is the reason for
returning these products?

A:: The TV flickers a lot when I am watching
a movie and at times the image is not very
clear.

B: I see, and what about the keyboard?

A: I spilled some coffee on it and now it
won’t work.

B: I am sorry sir, but we can only exchange
or refund defective products, we cannot take
responsibility for misuse or damages.

A: Fine! I don’t know why they make these
things so delicate anyways.
Daily Life ‐ Online Dating (C0300)

A: Do you want to hang out tomorrow?

B: Oh, I can’t. I have a date!

A: Really? Wow with who?

B: This girl I’ve been chatting with forthe
past couple of months. She’s really cool and
she’s driving over here this weekend.

A: Wait a minute, you mean you met her
online?

B: Yeah! I signed up for a website called
match. and it is great! You fill in all your
details and preferences, like if you are a
smoker or if you have any pets. Then you
find people that have similar characteristics
and you can email them or chat.

A: That is kind of weird! What if she is a
psycho or something like that?

B: It’s the same as meeting people anywhere
and dating them! I am just tired of going to
bars or being set up for dates by my friends!
I think this is a really cool alternative,
especially if you are a bit shy.

A: I guess it does seem logical. I’ll have to
check it out!
The Weekend ‐ Vampires (C0301)

A: You want to go tothe movies tonight?

B: Sure! What’s playing?

A: The new Twilight movie!

B: Twilight? As inthe vampire movies? No
way I am watching that. I don’t understand
why everyone isso excited about these films
about vampires. It doesn’t make sense.

A: Of course it does. It’s like a modern tale
of Romeo and Juliet. You have a couple that
101
Englishpod Dialogues
is in love but can’t be together because they
are so different. Add in the fact that
immortality and super human strengthis
really sexy and there you have it! Plus the
cast is hip, young people that make the
movie even more enticing.

B: I don’t buy into that. I think it’s just a fad.
Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will
be into werewolves or zombies!
Global View ‐ Phobias (C0302)

A: Are you excited about your trip next
month?

B: Yes and no. I can’t wait to go to Europe,
but at the same time I am terrified.

A: Why?

B: Well, I have aerophobia. I have a chronic
fear of flying.

A: Oh really? I have an uncle who is also
terrified of flying. It’s not that bad though, I
mean, it is pretty scary to be in this big
machine flying through the air at seven
hundred miles per hour. I actually have
arachnophobia.

B: You’re scared of spiders? I actually have
two more phobias. Acrophobia and
glossophobia.

A: I guess that explains why you are afraid
of flying, but public speaking is not that bad.

B: Are you kidding? When I get on stage, my
palms start to sweat, I get really nervous
and I can hardly speak.

A: Well, I must confess I am a bit
claustrophobic. I hate being in an elevator
for more than 5 seconds.

B: We are such weirdos right?
Daily Life ‐ Mexican Food (C0303)

A: Hello sir, welcome to Pistolera restaurant.
May I take your order?

B: Yes, I would like the chicken cheese
enchiladas with a side of guacamole.

A: I’m sorry sir, but we ran out of chicken.
May I suggest our delicious beef burritos or
cheese quesadillas? Both include a side of
guacamole and jalapenos.

B: Sure I’ll have the burrito.. Do you have
nachos?

A: Of course sir. Our nachos come with
melted cheese and chili.

B: Sounds good.

A: Would you like anything to drink?

B: Sure, I’ll have a Corona.
Daily Life ‐ Neat Freak (C0304)

A: Ugg, this bathroom is a pigsty!

B: Helen, why do you keep flushing the
toilet? What’s wrong?

A: I just can’t stand it. It’s really gross in
here! There’s a stain on the toilet seat, and
the floor was wet and slippery. So I cleaned
it!

B: You did what? Helen, I know it’s gross,
but I’ve seen many public washrooms that
are much worse. Why are you cleaning the
counter top? are you out of your mind?

A: I can’t help myself; it’s just so disgusting
in here!

B: Helen, this is not like your own bathroom.
Just leave it to the cleaners,okay?

A: Hang on. I’m just gonna quickly wipe the
sink and sweep the floor.

B: You’re such a neat freak! I’m outta here!
The Weekend ‐ Bowling (C0305)

A: Alright, so the first thing that you need to
know about bowling is that you should never
cross that line where the lane begins.

B: Why not?

A: Because they polish and oil it to make the
ball slide down. If you step there you will slip
and fall.

A: OK, so I got my bowling shoes, my ball,
our names on the scorecard, so now, how
the heck do I play this?

A: You throw the ball down the lane and try
to knock down all the pins. If you do, that is
called a strike. If you don’t knock them all
down on the first try, then you get a chance
to get the spare. After ten frames, we add up
the points and see who has the most. Three
hundred is a perfect score, but very hard to
102
Englishpod Dialogues
get.

B: Got it! OK, I’m gonna give it a go. Oh no!
My ball went in the gutter!

A: I told you, its harder than you think. Now
let a pro show you how it’s done.
The Weekend ‐ Pick Up Lines (C0306)

A: Let’s got out tomorrow night. We can go
to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend.

B: I don’t think that’s a good idea. I am just
not good with approaching someone and
starting up a conversation.

A: Maybe you just need a few pick up
lines,you know, break the ice.

B: Pick up lines don’t work!

A: Come on! You can just walk up to a girl
and say: “If you were a booger I’d pick you
first.”

B: What? Come on! That’s just lame! No girl
would fall for that!

A: Fine, then you can say: “So there you
are! I’ve been looking all over for YOU, the
woman of my dreams!”

B: That’s a good one! I think that’s pretty
funny.

A: Yeah, so you make her laugh, you make a
fool of yourself a little bit and then you buy
her a drink.

B: Ok, how does this sound: “I was so
enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that
wall over there. So I am going to need your
name and number for insurance purposes.”

A: Nice! Let’s go!

Michelle: That’s cool! How’s it going?
James: Well, I’m finding the classes pretty

Oh, and there’s a Snoopy on it which is

B: Those are my undies!
Global View ‐ Indian Food (C0309)

A: So where is this mystery restaurant that
we are going to?

B: It’s an Indian restaurant! I know you have
never had Indian food, so I thought you
might want to try.

A: That sounds great! I am craving some
type of beef dish.

B: Well, Indian cuisine actually doesn’t serve
beef. You see, cows are a sacred animal, a
very important element inthe Hindu religion,
so beef is not eaten.

A: I see, so what are we having? Chicken?

B: There are many amazing dishes to choose
from. We can havesome chicken tikka
masalawhich is an amazing curry. It’s a bit
spicy, but I think you can handle it.

A: Sounds good! I have always heard that
103
Englishpod Dialogues
Indian spices give a rich flavor to food.

B: Yeah. Also, we can have some Naan bread
which is baked in a tandoori oven. Since you
don’t use any utensils to eat, you can use
this bread to scoop upthe curry or rice.

A: What about veggies?

B: They have a good variety of vegetable
based dishes like palak paneer, vegetable
samosas or Daal.

A: It all sounds exquisite! I can’t wait!

How about you?
Maria: I’m actually inthe wine business.
Michelle: That sounds really great. I love
wine myself! Is this your first time to
Shanghai Maria?
Maria: No actually, I often visit. I usually
come to China for business at least once a
year. Also, I love the restaurants in
Shanghai, so that’s a good reason to come.
Michelle: Me too. Actually, there’s a great
Brazilian restaurant I recommend. I mean,
the food is delicious butthe service isn’t so
good. I often like to get together with friends

The Office ‐ First Paycheck (C0317)
Emily: Hey, Susan. Have you got a sec? I
have some questions about my paycheck.
Susan: You bet, Emily. Pull up a chair.
Emily: Well, this is my first paycheck here
inthe States and there are a few things I
don’t understand. First off, what is this FICA,
and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions
both for Medicare and for my health
insurance plan?
Susan: OK, let’s start from the top of your
pay stub. This number here represents your
gross pay.
Emily: Yes, that’s easy enough to
understand.
Susan: Then here we have a series of
deductions. First off are the federal ones.
FICA stands for Federal Insurance
Contribution Act, or something like that. It’s
your federal income tax. And then there’s
Social Security and Medicare, which are both
federal programs to help you out after you
retire or if you were unable to work.
Emily: All right, I see. So the Medicare isn’t
actually a health insurance I can use now.
Susan: That’s right. Below the federal
deductions are the state deductions. There’s
the state income tax, and then this SUI
SDItax you were asking about is paying into
an unemployment and disability fund that
our state has set up, but you can see it’s a
pretty small quantity that they take.
Emily: Yeah, I don’t mind giving them a
dollar fifty for that. So there are two
separate income taxes – one at a state level
and one at a federal level?
Susan: That’s right. Not all states have an
income tax. Some use higher property taxes
or sales taxes instead.
Emily: I see. All right, well I think everything

Global View - The Night Before
Christmas (C0337)
It was the night before Christmas, when all
through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a
mouse;
The stockings were hung bythe chimney with
care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be
there;
The children were nestled all snug in their
beds,
111
Englishpod Dialogues
And mama in her ’kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled down for a long winter’s nap,
When out on the lawn there arose such a
clatter, I sprang from the bed to see what
was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash, Tore
open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen
snow
Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below,
When, what to my wondering eyes should
appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny
reindeer,
With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they
came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called
them by name;
” Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer
and Vixen!
On, Comet! on Cupid! on, Donder and
Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the
wall!
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane
fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to
the sky, So up to the house-top the coursers
they flew,
With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas
too.
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof.
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning
around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a
bound.
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to
his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes
and soot;
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler just opening his
pack.
His eyes – how they twinkled! his dimples
how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a
cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a
bow,
Andthe beard of his chin was as white as the
snow;
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his
teeth,
Andthe smoke it encircled his head like a
wreath;
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook, when he laughed like a bowlful
of jelly.
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old
elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of
myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to
dread;
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his
work,
And filled allthe thestockings; then turned
with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, upthe chimney he rose;
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a
whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a
thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of
sight,
” Christmas to all, and to all a good-night.

some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until
you have a nice consistency. Then add some
vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing.

B: Do I have to use a whisk or can I use the
electric mixer?

A: Go ahead and use the mixer, but put it on
medium speed. I’m gonna sift the flour and
baking powder separately and then we can
mix it with milk and the rest of the
ingredients.

B: Ok, so now we need a baking pan right?

A: Yeah, but grease and flour it first so the
cake won’t stick to it when it bakes.

B: Done. So how long do we bake it for?

A: We can leave it in there for about twenty
five minutes.
Then we let it cool for ten minutes before we
remove the cake from the pan.

B: I can’t, I have to go tothe gym.

A: Come on! You can go tomorrow, just skip
it today.
It’s not as if you are gonna get in trouble!

B: Actually I will! I am working out with a
personal trainer that gets on my case if I
don’t go. I like it, because it makes me feel
more obligated to go and get healthy.

A: That’s cool, does your personal trainer
basically teach you how to work out?

B: Yeah. He makes a work put plan
depending on the areas I want to work on, or
the muscles I want to build. Like for example
in order to get better muscle tone in my abs,
pecs and biceps, he makes me work out with
free weights. Then for my quads, calves and
hamstrings, I do leg lifts or squats.

A: Sounds like you are really getting in

Global View - All About Wines (C0346)
Salesperson: Hello there, welcome to
WineWorld. Let me know if I can help you
out at all.
Customer: Um, yes, please, I could really
use some help. I’m going over to my boss’
house for dinner tonight and don’t know
what kind of wine I should bring.
Salesperson: OK, do you know what kind of
food will be served?
Customer: Well, his wife is Japanese. He said
she makes really good sushi.
Salesperson: Hmm, that’s a bit of a
challenge. Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair
with wine.
Well, let’s see. have to be a white wine, of
course.
Customer: Why? Wouldn’t a red wine go well
with sushi?
Salesperson: No, I don’t think so. Sushi is a
very delicately flavored food, and red wine
would be a jarring contrast. You need a white
wine, which has more subtle flavors, to
complement the fish.
Customer: I see. So should I get a bottle of
Chardonnay? That’s a white wine, right?
Salesperson: Yes, Chardonnay is a white
wine, but
I’m not sure it’d be your best bet.
Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied
whites, and tends to be a bit oaky. I’d
suggest that you go for something
brighter, like this Sauvignon Blanc from New
Zealand.
Customer: Sauvignon Blanc? What’s that?
Salesperson: That’s another varietal, or type
of grape, just like Chardonnay.
Customer: Let’s see. The label says it’s got
”attractive citrus and grassy aromas that
give way to crisp, mineral flavors and a
bonedry finish. Serve chilled.” Oh, no, how
long will it take to chill the wine? I’m on my
way to the dinner now.
Salesperson: It’s OK, don’t worry, we’ll just
choose a wine from the cooler. We don’t have
quite as extensive a selection over here,
but...this Rhone Valley white would be lovely.
Customer: All right. What varietal is that?
Salesperson: Well, this is a French wine, so
they don’t always specify the varietal on the
label.
The French believe that the soil a grape is
grown in is one of the most important factors
in the final flavor of the wine.
This wine is probably a blend of a few
different types of grapes, mostly Viognier,
I’d guess.
Customer: And you think this is a good wine?
Salesperson: Yes, this is one of our bestsellers.
It’s not quite as dry as the Sauvignon
Blanc we were looking at earlier, which
means it’s more approachable. It’s light and
crisp, with a bit of a vanilla aroma.
Customer: Perfect! I’ll take it!

A: Good afternoon, passport and arrival card
please.

B: Here you are.

A: Where are you coming from?

B: China.

A: Is this your country of birth or residence.

B: I just work there.

A: What is the purpose of your visit to the
United States?

B: I’m here on vacation.

A: How long do you plan to stay in the
United States?

B: Almost three weeks.

A: Sir, you didn’t fill out the information on
your arrival card of where you will be
staying.

B: Oh, I’m sorry, but there are a couple of
different places I will travel to within the
United States, so I wasn’t sure what to put.

A: You must specify an address of the place
where you will spend most of your time.

B: Ok, here you are.

A: Do you have enough means to support
yourself while you are here?

The Weekend - Talking About Skincare
(C0348)

A: You want to go get a facial with me today?

B: Dude, what are you talking about? Only
girls do that.

A: Not at all, guys also get facials, manicures
and pedicures. There is nothing wrong with
looking after your skin and looking good.

B: True. So what do they do to you at your
beauty spa?

A: Well, first they exfoliate my face, getting
rid of all the dead skin. Then I get a face
mask with nutrients that keep my skin
healthy and young. Afterwards, they apply
some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a
million bucks.

B: That doesn’t really sound like something I
would be interested in. In any case, I just
wash my face every night and use sunscreen
during the day.

A: Well you should come with me one day,
I’m sure you’ll love it.

B: Uh... no.
Global View - Chinese Medicine (C0349)

A: What’s wrong?

B: I have a headache. These past few days
I’ve been living off painkillers. Man, I feel like
my head is going to explode.

A: You should get acupuncture treatment. My
mom was always having headache issues
and it was acupuncture that cured her.

B: The results are too slow. On top of that,
just the thought of smoking needles poking
into my flesh frightens me.

A: They don’t just randomly stick you, they
find your pressure points. The heat allows
the body to immediately respond to the
treatment, restoring the body’s ”chi”.

B: But I get scared the moment I see a
needle. How could I stand having needles in
my body for hours on end?

A: The needles are very thin, and as long as
the doctor’s technique is good, and the
patient himself is relaxed, it won’t hurt–on
the contrary it will actually alleviate pain.
Now there are high-tech
needles that are micro thin; they don’t hurt
at all.
However, if you are really scared of
acupuncture, scraping or cupping are also
options.

B: Scraping is too terrifying. When they
finish scrapping, your body is all red, as if
you were just tortured.
Cupping is the same, your body ends up with
red circles all over it–looks like someone beat
you up.

A: This only signifies that the toxins have left
the body. Actually, there is only discomfort
during the treatment process. Once it’s over
you feel very comfortable.

B: Chinese medicine is strange. The patients
are already
ill, and then the doctor makes them suffer
more.

A: This is the only way to get at the problem.
Anyway, if you want to relieve the pain, You
are just going to have to be tough and do it.

B: Forget it. I don’t want to inflict any more
pain on myself. In a little while I’ll go and
buy some more painkillers and take a nap.
Daily Life - Talking About Relatives
(C0350)

A: What are you doing this weekend?

B: My brother in law is having a small get
together at his house and he invited me.

A: Is it a family thing or just friends?

B: A bit of both. Some cousins, aunts and
uncles will be there, but also some friends
from the neighborhood.

A: Is your great uncle Rick going to be
there? He is really funny.

B: Yeah he is going to be there with his stepson
and his ex-wife.

A: You mean your sister?

B: No, Rick is actually my great uncle, so he
is my grandmother’s brother.

A: You lost me.

B: I’ll explain later, let’s go.
Daily Life - Vaccinations (C0351)

Englishpod Dialogues
vaccination record, Ricky has received his
Polio, Tetanus and
Hepatitis B shots. He is 14 months old, so he
is due for Hepatitis A, Chickenpox and
Measles shots.

B: What about Rubella and Mumps?

A: Well, I can only give him these for now,
and after a couple of weeks I can administer
the rest.

B: Ok great. Doctor, I think I also may need
a
Tetanus booster. Last time I got it was
maybe fifteen years ago!

A: We will check our records and I’ll have the
nurse administer the booster as well. Now,
please hold
Ricky’s arm tight, this may sting a little.
Global View - The 7 Wonders Of The
World (C0352)

A: Have you seen this news article?
Apparently an
organization has made a list to name the
new seven wonders of the world and people
could vote for them online.

B: Wow, that’s really interesting. So who
won?

A: Well, the Great Wall of China, the Taj
Mahal in
India.

B: I’ve been there! It really is an amazing
work of architecture and art. The entire
complex is made of white marble and in the
interior of the tomb, the walls are covered
with gems and emeralds!

A: Cool! Also amongst the winners is Petra,
in Jordan,
Machu Picchu in Peru and the pyramid in
Chichenitza in Mexico.

B: Wait a minute! It also says that the Christ
Redeemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum
in
Rome are wonders. I would love to go to
Italy and see the Colosseum, stand in the
middle like a gladiator!

A: Well, let’s see if we can find some cheap
airfare and we can go towards the end of the
year.

B: Good idea!
Global View - College Life (C0353)

A: Hey, Jordan, is that you? Long time no
see!

B: Oh, hey, no kidding! I haven’t seen you
since orientation three months ago! So
how’ve you been?
Settling into college life OK?

A: Yeah, I think so! I pledged Phi Iota Alpha,
so I’m living at the frat house now.

B: Oh, so you’re a frat boy now, huh?

A: Yeah, yeah, I know, it’s totally clich ´ e,
but really, I think it’s been a good decision.
I’ve got a lot of support and good
suggestions from the guys.
What about you? What have you been up to?

B: Not much. I’m still living at home and
commuting to school. I ended up dropping
that metalworking class I was so excited
about. It just wasn’t as interesting as I’d
hoped. The guidance counselor suggested
that I focus on my prerequisite courses so
that I can make sure the credits count.

A: That sounds smart. . . but kind of boring.

B: Yeah, it is, a little bit. I joined the Great
Outdoors
Club, though, which has been a lot of fun.
We’ve gone on two camping trips already,
and I’ve made some good friends.

A: That’s cool. Hey, so have you decided on
your major yet?

B: Definitely pre-med. What about you?

A: I still have no clue. . . but we don’t have
to declare a major ‘til our sophomore year,
so I’ve got time!
Oops, I’m late for class. Gotta run!

B: OK, take care! Hey, nice running into you!

A: Yeah, you too!
Global View - Homeschooling (C0354)

A: I think we should home school our
children when we decide to have kids.

B: What? Why?

A: Well, our public schools here are not very
good and private school are just too
expensive. I have been reading up on home
schooling and it has a lot of advantages.

B: Like what? I think that by doing
something like that we would be isolating our
children from social interaction.
117
Englishpod Dialogues

A: Well, first of all, I would be able to teach
them everything they learn in school in a
more relaxed and fun way. I also think that
having a one-on-one class is much better
since you can focus more on his or her
strengths or weaknesses.

B: I think neither your parents or mine would
agree to such an idea.

A: I will bring it up over Sunday brunch.

B: Good luck with that!
Daily Life - Lending Money (C0355)

A: Can I borrow five bucks?

B: No!

A: Come on! I’ll pay you back on Tuesday.

B: Last time I lent you money, you never
paid me back.

A: I promise if you lend me five dollars
today, I will repay you in full next week.

B: Ok, but I’m taking your skateboard as
collateral.

A: Fine! I can’t believe you don’t trust me.

B: It’s nothing personal, just business.
Daily Life - Coins and Money (C0356)

A: Help me organize these coins.

B: That’s a lot of money! What did you do?
Break the piggy bank?

A: Yeah, I’m gonna go to the bank and
change it for bills, but first I have to separate
them into little piles.

B: Ok, I’ll find all the quarters and dimes
while you sort the nickels and pennies.

A: Great, then we can add everything up and
take it to the bank.

B: I found some coins that are not from
here.

A: Oh yeah, those are from my trip to
London. I have a couple of different pence,
but in all it won’t add up to one pound.

B: Are you sure the bank will change these
coins for you?

A: Hopefully!

Daily Life - Text Me (C0358)

A: Why didn’t you text me last night?

B: What? I sent you three or four messages!

A: I didn’t get any of them. I was waiting for
you to text me the address of where the
party was and I never got your message.

B: Why didn’t you just call? I hate sending
SMS messages.

A: Well, because I didn’t have any credit on
my phone. I used it all up this month.

B: I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan?

A: I do, but if I don’t have any credit in my
phone, it won’t let me call or send messages.

B: No wonder you didn’t get my texts!
Global View - E-mail Scam (C0359)

A: I got an urgent email from Tom! He says
he is in
London and got robbed and needs us to wire
him some money for his hotel.

B: What? That sounds really dodgy tome.

A: No way, Tom is an honest person, he
wouldn’t lie tome.

B: No I mean, it seems like someone may
have hacked his email account and sent that
out. I mean think about it, why would he
email you instead of calling you.

A: Do you really think someone is trying to
scam people into sending money?

B: For sure! There are so many con artists
out there, you never really know.
Global View - Urban Legends (C0360)

A: Have you read all these crazy things that
are going on around the world?

B: What do you mean?

A: I was reading about how some people get
tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and
have their organs removed! Then they are
sold on the black market.
118
Englishpod Dialogues

B: Don’t tell me you actually believe all that?
Don’t be so gullible, they are just urban
legends. They are just stories people make
up to scare you.

A: Well, I was also reading about how some
popular songs have subliminal or even
satanic messages if you play them
backwards! Can you believe that?

B: You really think an artist or songwriter is
going to go through the trouble of putting
subliminal or satanic messages in a song?
Don’t be so naive!

A: Well maybe you are right, but how about
the story of how KFC has rows of headless
chickens which are super grown in order to
get bigger chickens faster!

B: Sounds a bit too far fetched to be true
don’t you think?
Daily Life - Fast Food (C0361)

A: I’m hungry, let’s order up something to
eat.

B: Ok, maybe we can order a soup and a
salad from the restaurant down the street.

A: I was thinking of getting a hamburger,
fries and a chocolate sundae.

B: You eat too much junk food. That sort of
stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high
in cholesterol.

A: Well I never seem to gain weight so I
don’t mind.

B: It’s not only about getting fat or not, it’s
about being healthy. You could really have
some health problems later on.

A: How about pizza or maybe some fried
chicken!
Better yet, let’s order some hot dogs!

B: You are a lost cause.
Daily Life - What Mood Are You In?
(C0362)

A: Are you ok? You seem a bit anxious.

B: Yeah I’m OK, I have been having a lot of
mood swings lately. I think it has to do with
the pills my doctor prescribed that are
causing chaos on my hormones.

A: So you mean you feel ecstatic one minute
and then blue the next?

B: Yeah, it’s weird. For example just this
morning
I was feeling detached and lonely, even
though there was really no reason to feel
that way.

A: Well, maybe your mood will swing
positively and you will feel confident, brave
and hopeful!

B: I hope you are right.
Daily Life - Living With Your Parents
(C0363)

A: Why did your girlfriend break up with you?

B: I don’t know, she said she was tired of me
not manning up and being more
independent, which I think is all a bunch of
crap.

A: Well, you still live with your parents, so
she does have a point.

B: What do you mean? Lots of people live
with their parents, especially when rent is so
expensive and the slump in the economy.

A: Yeah, but you are almost forty! Plus, you
make good money so there is really no
excuse. It’s simply because you are a
momma’s boy.

B: Whatever dude, I have everything I need,
why would I move out! Have a great roof
over my head, my mom does my laundry
and cooks for me, what else could a guy ask
for!

A: Let’s agree to disagree.
Daily Life - Hiring Help (C0364)

A: Can you help me write a newspaper ad?

B: Sure, what are you looking to buy or sell?

A: Actually, I want to hire someone to help
me around the house.

B: Oh, you want to get a maid?

A: Well, I think it’s better if you call her a
cleaning lady or domestic help.

B: Ok, so what do you want her to do?

A: Well, let’s see. I want her to come in three
times a week for a couple of hours to clean
the kitchen, bathroom and maybe do some
cooking.

B: Got it. And how much do you offer per
month?

A: I would pay her hourly, I don’t know what
the going rate is though.

B: I know for sure it’s more than minimum
wage but maybe you should just negotiate
119

with the person that answers the ad.

A: Great! Thanks for your help!
Daily Life - Household Chores (C0365)

A: Kevin, what is this mess? It looks like a
pigsty in here! Clean this up!

B: Ok dad, I will do it in a minute, let me just
finish this level of this game.

A: No, I said now! Plus, you are grounded,
you’re not allowed to play video games. I
want you to make your bed, do the laundry
and then come downstairs and sweep the
floors.

B: That’s so unfair!

A: You have to pull your weight around here
young man. My house, my rules.

B: But I already mopped the floors, dusted
the furniture and vacuumed the rugs!

A: That’s great, but you still have work to do,
so get to it.
