这段英语看起来很奇怪，因为它是用了一种叫做 Pig Latin（猪拉丁文） 的文字游戏改写的英语。Pig Latin 是一种将单词重新排列或修改的趣味语言，经常用于英语国家作为一种轻松或秘密交流的方式。

在 Pig Latin 中，规则通常是：

1.如果单词以"辅音"开头，将这个辅音移到单词末尾，并加上 "_ay_"。例如：

- "hello" → "ello-h__ay__"
- "Daniel" → "Aniel-d__ay__"

2.如果单词以"元音"开头，直接在单词后加上 "yay" 或 "ay"。例如：

- "I" → "I-_yay_"

3.某些变体中可能会有其他规则，但上述是最常见的。

这段话是正常英语改写成 Pig Latin 的样子。如果将其翻译回普通英语，大致如下：

A: Hello, Daniel speaking, how may I help you? +
B: Hey, Daniel, Julie here. +
A: Hey, Julie, how are you? +
B: Actually, I’m feeling quite ill today. +
A: I’m sorry to hear that. But what’s wrong? +

A: I see. So you’re calling in sick? +

== 078. Elementary ‐ The Weekend ‐ International Workers Day (C0078)

A: Alright everyone settle down. Let’s get
started. As you know, an important aspect of
becoming a good citizen is understanding the
genesis of our legal system. It is not enough
to simply memorize our laws, it is necessary
that we comprehend why and how they were
formed. This brings me to our topic for today.
Does anyone know what we celebrate on May
first?

B: Cinco de mayo?

A: No, that’s May fifth in Spanish, James, no
wonder you are failing my Spanish class. No,
May first is International Workers’ Day.

B: Do we get a day off from school then?

A: No! It is not considered to be a national
holiday here in the US, but in other countries
it is.

B: Aww, man!

A: In the nineteenth century, working
conditions were appalling, with workers being
forced to work ten, twelve, and fourteen
hours a day. Support for the eight-hour work
day movement was growing rapidly, despite
the indifference and hostility of many union
leaders, and by April 1886, 250,000 workers
were involved in the May Day movement.
Previous legislative attempts to improve
working conditions had failed, so labor
organizers took drastic measures. They
passed a resolution stating that eight hours
would constitute a legal day’s work. And, on
May First 1886, the resolution took effect.

B: Cool! Is that why we only work eight
hours now?

A: Yes! But the happy ending came at a high
price. On May third, 1886, police fired into a
crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper
Works Factory, killing four and wounding
many. A mass meeting was called for the
next day to protest the brutality.

B: And then what happened?

A: Well, as we say, the rest is history...

job!

you, not a day has gone by when I haven’t
thought of you. And now that I’m with you
again, I’m... I’m just scared, Veronica. The
closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The
thought of not being with you, I mean, I just
can’t handle it! We were made for each
other, Veronica. You are my everything, my
soul mate. What can I do?

A: Just hold me... I’ll always be here for you,
no matter what. And together, we can tackle
whatever life throws at us. I believe in us,
Veronica.

B: I’m so happy to hear that! I knew we
belong together. I love you so much.
