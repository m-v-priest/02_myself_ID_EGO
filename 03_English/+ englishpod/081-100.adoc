sung, and the umpire has started the game.
It’s time to play ball!

A: A very nice curve ball by the pitcher. The
catcher gives him the sign, he winds up and
Vargas gets a line drive!

B: The players are scrambling to get the ball.
Vargas gets to first base and he’s still going!
The outfielder throws it to second! Vargas
slides! He’s safe!

A: Great play!

B: We have a runner on third and up at bat
is Brian Okami! There’s the pitch, he hits it!
It’s going, going, that ball is gone!

== Elementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ At The Airport (C0089)

A: Next please! Hello sir, may I see your
passport please?

B: Yes, here you go.

A: Will you be checking any bags.

B: Yes, I’d like to check three pieces.

A: I’m sorry, sir. Airline policy allows only two
pieces of checked luggage, at twenty
kilograms each, plus one piece of carry-on
luggage. I will have to charge you extra for
the additional suitcase.

B: What? Why! I am taking an
intercontinental flight! I’m flying sixteen
thousand kms! How am I supposed to only
take two, twenty kilo bags? That’s absurd!

A: I am sorry, sir, there’s nothing I can do.
You cannot board the flight with that large
bag either. Carry-on bags must fit in the
over-head compartment or under your seat.
That bag is clearly too big.

B: Now I see. You charge next to nothing for
an international ticket, but when it comes to
charging for any other small thing, you
charge an arm and a leg! So tell me, miss,
how much will I have to pay for all of this.

guys? I didn’t know you have a gun! What’s
going on!

A: I will come clean as soon as we get to
safety, OK? For now, you have to trust me,
please! I would never do anything to hurt
you.

B: Steven, I...

A: Okay, run! I haven’t been completely
honest with you Veronica, I’m sorry. I’m not
a fireman. I’m not even from the United
States. I’m a spy for the Indian government.

B: What? Why didn’t you tell me before?
What are you doing here?

A: When I was a young boy, I used to play
cricket my father back in my hometown of
Hyderabad. It was a peaceful town, and my
father was a renowned chemist. One day, he
was approached by members of the CIA,
claiming that my father had made the
discovery of the millennium in his small lab
back at the university where he taught biochemistry.
I never saw him again. I vowed to
discover the whereabouts of my father and
consequently joined the Indian Intelligence
Bureau.

B: What does that have to do with those
men shooting at us? Most importantly, why
did you lie to me!

A: I’m sorry, I wasn’t supposed to meet you.
I wasn’t supposed to fall in love with you, but
you have to believe me when I tell you that
what I feel for you is real.

B: I can’t believe this! Why are all these
things happening to me! I can’t take it
anymore! Let me out of the car!

never seen so many stars before! It’s
beautiful!

B: See that constellation there? That’s Orion!
And the very bright star? Well, it’s not a star
since it doesn’t blink. That’s actually Venus.

A: What’s that big flashy one?

B: I don’t know... I think it’s a UFO!

C: Greetings earthlings. I come from afar,
from a distant galaxy known only to a few.

A: Why are you here? Where did you come
from?

C: We have been observing you for the last
three thousand years. We have seen the
amazing capacity that humans have to create
such wonders as the Taj Mahal or
masterpieces such as the Haffner symphony.
Unfortunately, your intelligence and creativity
does not come without consequence. Your
ambition and desire for more will be your
downfall, and we are here to save your
planet from you.

B: You think you have us figured out? What
gives you the right to come and judge us?
Who are you to play God with our fate?

C: Silence human! It is that belligerent
attitude that has caused years of pain and
anguish among yourselves! Now you will pay
the price!

== Elementary ‐ Intermediate ‐ Volleyball (C0093)

A: It’s a beautiful day here in New Zealand at
the Men’s Volleyball world championship. My
name is Rick Fields and I’m joined by the
man with the plan, Bob Copeland.

B: Thank you, Rick. We’ve got a very exciting
encounter ahead of us today as two
powerhouse teams, Brazil and China, face off
against each other and try to qualify for the
next round. Without a doubt, both teams are
in top shape and this will prove to be a
competitive match.

A: The ref signals the start of the game and
here we go. Ribeiro serves and China quickly
receives the ball. Chen bumps it to the
setter, and... a very nice set by Chen!

B: Xu spikes it! Wow, what a great hit! The
Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and
tried to block him but he managed to get the
ball in! Great play.

A: It’s China’s service now. What a superb
jump serve by Li, oh, and we have a let
serve. The ball was coming in fast and
almost made it over the net.

B: Brazil calls for a time out and we’ll be
right back, after a short commercial break.

== Elementary ‐ Global View ‐ Big Bang Theory (C0094)

A: What’s up? You don’t look too good.

B: Yeah, my head hurts, that’s all. I’ve been
in physics class all day. It’s killer!

A: I liked physics. It’s all math, really; arcs,
curves, velocity, cool stuff.

B: Yeah, yeah, but today’s lesson was all
about the creation of the universe.

A: A physics class about the creation of the
universe? That’s some pretty unscientific
language there. Sounds more religious to
me.

B: It’s all religion. Take the theory of the Big
Bang. How is it possible that all of the stuff in
the universe comes from an explosion?
That’s no better than Atlas carrying the globe
on his back or African myths about turtles
and stuff.

A: Turtles? Whatever... Look, all that’s
required for the creation of matter an
imbalance of particles and anti-particles. At
least, that’s what the math says.

B: Math, shmath. What’s the evidence?

A: There is evidence! You know Edwin
Hubble? He’s the guy who in the early
twentieth century was the first scientist to
measure the drift of matter in the universe,
thus advancing notions of an expanding
universe. What would it be expanding from?
Well, the Big Bang... DUH!

B: Anyway, it’s just a theory. Why do people
go around touting theories? Where’s the
scientific rigor in that?

A: Dude, don’t equivocate. A theory only
becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous
testing. You slept through class, didn’t you?

B: Agh! You’re making my head hurt again!
Quit with the questions!

A: He’s doing well. We went out for a couple

B: Oh yeah?

A: Well, we were talking and catching up on
what we’ve been doing, talking about work

mouse run under his chair and he completely
lost it! He started freaking out, and
screaming...

B: Ha ha, really?

A: Yeah, and the funniest thing was, that he
jumped on to his chair and started shrieking
like a girl. You had to be there! Everyone was
staring and laughing... it was hilarious!

in the evening. Things are looking a bit
better for the South; we’ll see cloudy skies
with a chance of showers. Later in the day,
we can expect partly cloudy skies, with a
forecast high of thirty-eight degrees.

A: You heard it folks! It’s gonna be a cold
one!

== Elementary ‐ Global View ‐ Movie Review (C0099)

Englishpod Dialogues

A: Welcome back movie lovers to another ”
Premier Movie Review”. My name is Richard
Clarke and I am joined today by the very
erudite DavidWatson.

B: Thank you Dick. Today we are going to
talk about the movie ” Lion King”. Tell me
Dave, what is your impression of this film?

A: Well, I think this film is simply a fable,
depicting man’s eternal greed for power, and
in my opinion, it’s a very fine film. Even
despite the accusations of plagiarism
traditional folk tales from other countries.
The musical score was amazing, the
animation was very well done, and the story
was simply enchanting.

B: I think otherwise. Even though the
animation was technically strong, and as you
say, the score and songs performed by Elton
John were great, the film lacks a certain
originality; it lacked heart. And I would dare
to say, it was too predictable.

A: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It’s a Grated
movie! It’s for the kids! It’s not a
thriller!

B: Well, that’s just it. It did have some very
dramatic and intense scenes. For example
when Mufasa dies, or the dark, grim
portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear.
Mufasa dies, Simba runs away thinking it’s
his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake
what is rightfully his. It’s just too cliché.

A: How can it be cliché? It’s a fable! It’s
telling a time-honoured story! The movie
make a point of how the hunger for power
leads to corruption, and teaches children the
value of respect, life and love.

B: You have always been so soft, Dave!

A: Open your heart Dick. Don’t shut us out.

B: Anyway... That’s all for today folks! Join
us next time as we talk about &quot;How to
lose a guy in 10 days&quot; I’m sure you’ll
love that one Dave!
