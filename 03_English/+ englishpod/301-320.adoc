== The Weekend ‐ Vampires 吸血鬼（夜间走出坟墓吸吮活人血的游魂） (C0301)

A: You want to go to the movies tonight?

[.my2]
你今晚想去看电影吗？

[.my1]
.案例
====
- "You want to" is used to make an invitation or suggestion.
====

B: Sure! What’s playing?

A: The new Twilight 黄昏，薄暮时分；暮光，暮色 movie!

[.my2]
新的《暮光之城》电影！

B: Twilight? As 就像 in the vampire movies? *No
way* 不可能,没门 I am watching that. I don’t understand
why everyone is so excited about these films
about vampires. It doesn’t make sense.

[.my2]
《暮光之城》？就是那些吸血鬼电影？我绝对不看。我不明白为什么大家对这些吸血鬼电影这么兴奋。这完全没有道理。

A: Of course it does. It’s like a modern tale 故事，传说
of _Romeo and Juliet_. You have a couple 一对夫妇，一对情侣 that
 is *in love* but can’t be together because they
are so different. Add *in the fact that*
immortality 永生；不朽；不灭 and _super human strength_ is
really sexy *and there you have it* 就是这样,就这样成了! Plus the
cast 演员阵容 is hip (a.)（衣服、音乐等方面）时髦的，赶时髦的, young people that make the
movie even more enticing  有诱惑力的；诱人的；有吸引力的.

[.my2]
当然有道理。它就像现代版的《罗密欧与朱丽叶》。有一对恋人相爱，但因为他们的差异而无法在一起。再加上永生和超人的力量真的很性感，这就是它的魅力所在！而且演员们都很时尚年轻，这让电影更加诱人。(年轻人让这部电影更加吸引人。)

[.my1]
.案例
====
."and there you have it"
在这里可以理解为「你看，就是这么回事/就这样成了」，是一种口语化的总结表达。类似于说「把这些东西组合在一起，就得到了最终的结果」。

作者前面列举了故事的核心元素： +
类似《罗密欧与朱丽叶》的禁忌之恋； +
永生和超能力的性感设定； +
年轻时髦的演员阵容。 +

说完这些后，用 "and there you have it" 来收尾，相当于说：
「把这些吸引人的元素全部加在一起，整个故事的魅力就完整展现出来了！」
====

B: I don’t *buy #into#* 买进;相信，接受 that. I think it’s just a fad 一时的风尚；短暂的狂热.
Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will
be *#into#* werewolves 狼人 or zombies 僵尸!

[.my2]
我不相信这些。我觉得这只是一时的风尚。很快这就会过去，然后大家都会迷上狼人或僵尸！

== The Office ‐ First Paycheck (C0317)
Emily: Hey, Susan. Have you got a sec? I
have some questions about my paycheck.
Susan: You bet, Emily. Pull up a chair.
Emily: Well, this is my first paycheck here
inthe States and there are a few things I
don’t understand. First off, what is this FICA,
and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions
both for Medicare and for my health
insurance plan?
Susan: OK, let’s start from the top of your
pay stub. This number here represents your
gross pay.
Emily: Yes, that’s easy enough to
understand.
Susan: Then here we have a series of
deductions. First off are the federal ones.
FICA stands for Federal Insurance
Contribution Act, or something like that. It’s
your federal income tax. And then there’s
Social Security and Medicare, which are both
federal programs to help you out after you
retire or if you were unable to work.
Emily: All right, I see. So the Medicare isn’t
actually a health insurance I can use now.
Susan: That’s right. Below the federal
deductions are the state deductions. There’s
the state income tax, and then this SUI
SDItax you were asking about is paying into
an unemployment and disability fund that
our state has set up, but you can see it’s a
pretty small quantity that they take.
Emily: Yeah, I don’t mind giving them a
dollar fifty for that. So there are two
separate income taxes – one at a state level
and one at a federal level?
Susan: That’s right. Not all states have an
income tax. Some use higher property taxes
or sales taxes instead.
Emily: I see. All right, well I think everything
else I can figure out on my own. The
deductions for health insurance and my
401(K) are pretty self-explanatory. Thanks
for your help, Susan.
Susan: No problem! All those deductions do
add up, and nobody’s net pay is as high as
they’d like. I can understand why you’d want
some explanation.
Emily: Yeah, I guess it’s the same in the UK,
I just never paid much attention. See you
later!

Actually, could you recommend what to eat
here? I’ve never been here before.
Michelle: Sure. Well, the avocado sandwich
is delicious, and it’s the healthiest thing on
the menu. Personally, I think the beef salad
is the tastiest choice. I usually get that. Also,
the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in
town!
Older gentle- man: Well, thanks for the
suggestions. Michelle: Oh, don’t mention it.

== Global View ‐ Taking The GMAT (C0320)

Ash: I can’t seem to progress up the career
ladder no matter how hard I try and I have
been here for 2 years already!
Mindy: Well, have you thought of getting an
MBA? I heard it does wonders in getting you
to the top.
Ash: An MBA hey. . . well my degree wasn’t
in business, the business schools won’t be
interested in me.
Mindy: Nonsense! The business schools
measure your ability through a test called
GMAT.
Ash: GMAT? What does that stand for and
what will the test contain?
Mindy: Graduate Management Admission
Test, it contains three parts; Analytical
Writing Assessment, the Quantitative section,
and the Verbal section. Not only does the
test mark you on the number of questions
answered but also on the difficulty.
Ash: Okay this sounds a little tough, how am
I supposed to practice for this?
Mindy: Up to you, you could have a one on
one session with a tutor or group sessions,
you can also use free or private computer
software. Going to church might help as well!
Ash: No matter what I do I’m going to ace
this test and go on to become a corporate fat
cat!
Mindy: Umm.. . That’s the spirit!
