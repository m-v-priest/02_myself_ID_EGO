== Elementary ‐Daily Life ‐ Car Trouble (C0221)

A: Car trouble center. How may I help you?

Englishpod Dialogues

B: My car won’t start! Stupid old car!

A: Hold on, before you kick your car let’s go
through some possible problems.

B: Fine.

A: Ok, first of all, can you turn the key in the
ignition?

B: Yeah! I am here with my friend and he
thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter
motor.

A: Those are possible problems, but tell me,
when you turn the key, do you hear the
starter motor crank?

B: Yeah, it sounds like it usually does when I
start the car, but nothing else happens. The
engine won’t start. Should I maybe press the
accelerator?

A: No. If you step on the accelerator pedal
you can flood the carburetor and your car will
never start.

B: So what do you think it is?

A: I know this may seem like a silly question,
but does your car have gasoline?

B: Umm. yeah! Right! I got the car started!
Thanks for your help! I told you to fill the
tank!

== Elementary ‐Global View ‐ Carbon Footprint (C0222)

A: So what’s your guys’ take on all this
global warming hysteria in the media?

B: It’s pretty serious, man. There have been
tons of scientific studies and the scientific
community says that the earth is heating up.
We need to make some drastic changes to
our lifestyle if we want to preserve our
planet.

A: I don’t know. It sounds like a bunch of
mumbo jumbo if you ask me. ”Save the
earth!” The earth will save itself. It’s survived
worst disasters in the past. I mean, honestly,
we live in the boonies. There’s no way
anyone here is ever going to walk or bike to
work, especially in the winter. And we have
no bus system. My house is forty years old
and it would take a lot of money to get it
refitted to be ”green” and ”energy-efficient”.

C: Well I don’t really know if I believe in
global warming either, or whether or not it
was our doing or a natural change the earth
is going through, but you have to admit that
we’re living pretty irresponsibly here in the
west.

A: I guess...

C: I think the issue at hand is sustainability.
We’ve only got this one earth we can live on,
and our resources are quickly disappearing
because of our own carelessness and our
inability to think of anyone but ourselves and
anything but the present.

B: So, like I was saying, we need to change
the way we live. We need to reduce our
carbon footprint.

C: But it doesn’t have to be that drastic.
Hybrid vehicles and solar panels are too
expensive to be feasible right now. And we
don’t have to be hippies living off the land
and buying everything organic either, though
it helps.

B: I car pool to work everyday with some
buddies of mine. I have a rain barrel outside
my house I use to water my plants and my
lawn in the summer, and I make sure I
always bring reusable bags with me when I
get my groceries. And we just started using
bio-degradable plastic made from corn oil for
take-out orders at my family’s restaurant.
Remember the three R’s? Reduce. Reuse.
Recycle.

C: Exactly, it’s just small simple changes, like
buying energy-saving light bulbs, starting a
compost bin, recycling bottles and papers,
using reusable water bottles, stop using
disposable cups and cutlery.

A: Like the ones we’re drinking out of?

B: Yeah.

Officer: A goatee? Was it like Paul’s?
Brown:
Sally: Ah yes, that’s it, he had a

== Elementary ‐Global View ‐ Crime Scene (C0224)
Detective MeGee: Alright, Officer McGraw,
Give it to me straight, what are we looking at
here?
McGraw: Detective MeGee! We’re glad to
see you! We could sure use your expertise on
this one. It’s a break-in, but nothing seems
to have been stolen. We received a call from
the Bear family at around ten thirty this
morning. They had gone out for a walk
before breakfast and came home to this
mess! Broken chairs and porridge all over the
place! Apparently, Momma Bear had made
the porridge a little too hot, you see, and
they were waiting for it to cool down.
Detective MeGee: Okay then, let’s start
examining the evidence. . . . Have the
forensics team been in yet?
McGraw: Yes sir. They found some
fingerprints on the bowls and are analyzing
them back at the lab as we speak. Hopefully,
they will be able to identify the burglar soon.
Detective MeGee: Hmmmm,Ah ha! What’s
this? A strand of golden hair. . . . . . this is a
very important piece of trace evidence
McGraw. It tells me the suspect has long
golden hair. . . . . . . very few men have long
golden hair. . . . . . . our criminal could be a
woman. . . . . .
McGraw: A woman? Was she working alone?
Did she have an accomplice?
Detective MeGee: An accomplice? No, no
McGraw, she was definitely working alone.
See here, there are footprints in the
porridge, here on the floor. . . . footprints,
tells me that our suspect is small. . . . could
possibly be a child.
McGraw: A child? Surely not, sir. . .
Detective MeGee: We must follow the
clues, McGraw! The evidence doesn’t lie!
Now, let’s reconstruct the crime. . . . . . the
suspect came in, sat in each chair breaking
the smallest one into little pieces. Next, the
porridge. she obviously tried to eat it and
because it was so hot, she dropped it on the
floor. . . . this mess. interesting. These
footprints seem to lead upstairs. McGraw, did
your officers clear the scene?
McGraw: Well, there was no one down here.
. . andmaybe we forget to check upstairs.
Goldylocks: Hey! What’s with all the noise?
I’m trying tosleep up here!
Detective MeGee: There she is! Get her!

Ralph: I get in the box.
Frankie: Right, you get in the box. I’ll make

the bank manager is leaving early on

He and the wife are having a romantic
rendezvous in the country, so any packages
delivered will be left unopened in his office

mix-up with the delivery I made and take the

== Elementary ‐Global View ‐ Fundraiser (C0226)

A: Ok Mark, it’s your turn to ring the
doorbell. I did it last time.

B: I hate going door to door, and I hate
asking for money.

A: But we need to raise enough money for
the school fundraiser so that our class can
win the pizza party! You do want to have a
pizza party, don’t you?

B: Yes, but...

A: Just go already!

B: No one’s coming.

A: Try again.

B: Maybe there’s no one home.

A: Of course there’s someone home! There
are two cars in the driveway and I see lights
on in the house! Hello! Anybody home? We
would like to know if you want to sponsor us
in our school fundraiser. Fifty percent of the
profits go towards the new school
playground!

B: I don’t know why anyone would want
what’s in this catalog anyway. It’s just a
bunch of tacky Christmas ornaments, Cd’s of
old people singing Christmas songs, and
special crackers and cheeses and boxes of
chocolates.

A: You don’t like chocolates?

B: Not this kind. They’ve got weird names
like ganache and praline.

A: Look! I just saw someone walking around

A: Hi, sir. Would you like to sponsor us or
make a donation to.

C: What grade are you kids in?

A: Grade seven.

== Elementary ‐Daily Life ‐ Wedding Planning (C0227)

A: Trina, will you marry me?

B: Yes! Yes! And yes! Jared of course I’ll
marry you!

A: Oh Babe, I can’t wait to spend the rest of
my life with you! I can’t wait for all the
adventures we’re going to have, for all the
fights and the laughter. I can’t wait to grow
old and wrinkly with you.

B: Oh Jared! I can’t wait for our wedding! I
hope you don’t mind, but I’ve already chosen
a date! Six months from now in the summer!
Melissa saw you buying the ring last month
so I’ve had plenty of time to start planning!

A: She what?

B: Oh don’t worry sweetie, I didn’t know
when you were going to propose. It was still
a nice surprise! As I was saying, I’ve got it all
planned out. There’s almost nothing left to
do! I wrote up our guest list and we will have
roughly four hundred guests
attending.

A: four hundred?

B: No need to sweat it. My parents agreed to
pay for most of the wedding, which is going
to be low budget anyway. So roughly four
hundred people, which means that the hall at
Northwood Heights will be our reception
venue. I thought it would be nice if we had
the wedding at your parents’ church and my
uncle of course would be officiating. We’ll
meet with him soon for some pre-wedding
counseling. The music for the wedding
ceremony was a no-brainer. My step-sister
and her string quartet will take care of that.
My cousin will be the official photographer. I
thought it would also be nice if his daughter
could sing a solo. Did you know that she’s
going to be a professional opera singer?

A: Ah...

B: And then of course the ladies at the
church would love to be our caterers for the
banquet and we’ll get the Youth Group to
serve us. I was thinking that your friend’s
band could be our entertainment for the
night. though they might have to tone it
down a bit. Or we could hire a DJ. Your
sister’s husband could get us a discount with
that company that does the decor at
weddings. What’s their name again? I was
thinking that we could have an island
paradise- themed wedding and our theme
color would be a soothing blue like
Aquamarine.
And there will be a huge seashell on the wall
behind the podium where we’ll make our
toasts! What do you think of small packages
of drink mixes for our wedding favors? Who
else am I missing? Oh, your uncle could be
our florist and his wife could make our
wedding cake!

A: Wow.

B: See? It’s going to be wonderful! Oh this
wedding is going to be everything I ever
dreamed of.

A: If I survive the next six months.

B: Ok kids, here’s a beach ball and a Frisbee,
a pail and a shovel. I want to see an
impressive sandcastle by the time we leave.
Don’t stray too far. Wait! Leave your sandals
here or put on your wet shoes.

A: And stay in the shallow area. I don’t want
to see you go any farther than that sandbar!
It’s too deep out there and we didn’t bring
your floaties.

B: You’re back already? The water was too
cold, huh? I’ll tell you a secret. Do you see
that small pool of water over there? It’ll be
warmer in there. Go see if you can find some
seashells or catch some minnows.

A: What is that? A jellyfish? Jeremy, put that
down right now! It could sting you!

B: What type of tools?

A: You know, the basics. A rake, shovel,
spade and a hoe.

B: Right. Well it seems like you have all your

you have in mind?
Mom: Black. Classic.
Salesgirl: Of course. We’ve got this style
here that is very popular. Because it’s an
open-toe shoe, you can wear it any time of
the year. They look great on everyone.
Mom: Umm. too shiny. And I wear
pantyhose with my shoes so let’s look for a
closed-toe shoe.
Salesgirl: Ok, these are a very nice pair of
leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they
are very comfortable.
Mom: I don’t like the pointed toes. Let me
take a look at what else you have. Too high.
That one looks like the back would cut into
my heel. I have a high instep so I doubt that
one will fit properly. I don’t want bows. I find
slingbacks very uncomfortable. Those might
as well be stilettos. Too modern. Ah, finally,
this is what I’m looking for.
Salesgirl: What size?
Mom: Seven-and-a-half.
Salesgirl: Here we are How does it fit?
Mom: Hmmm. not good. They’re too tight.
The length is right, but the shoe is too
narrow and it’s pinching my toes. And there’d
be no room for my insoles. You know what? I
don’t think I have the patience for this today.
They just don’t make shoes like they used to.

a half to get ready in the mornings. Every
day, I wake up and head straight for the
shower. Every second day, I wash my hair. If
it’s a hair-washing day, I frequently need to
wash my hair twice because it gets really
oily. Then I usually put in a conditioner and
have to rinse that out too. Because my hair
is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower
in under twenty minutes. Afterwards, I often
put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I
wait for it to brew. I take a long time to get
dressed in the morning. Every now and then
I remember to choose my outfit the night
before , but usually I do it in the morning. In
all, getting dressed takes about half an
hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry
so then I have to style my hair. From time to
time I’ll put my hair up, but oftentimes I
blowdry it straight. And then, because of the
texture of my hair, I regularly have to flatiron
it to keep it from frizzing. That’s another
twenty minutes or so. After that, I have my
daily makeup routine.
Jacob: True, I hardly ever see you without
your hair done and your makeup on, even
when you show up to class in sweatpants.
Tell me, how long does it take you to choose
that outfit in the morning?

== Elementary ‐The Office ‐ Interview Skills Part 2 ‐ Discussing Your Background (C0238)
Mr. Parsons: Now, Miss Childs passed on
your resume to me and I’ve had the chance
to look it over and I must say I’m quite
impressed.
Rebecca: Thank you very much. I’ve tried to
keep it short and clear. If there’s any
questions please feel free to ask me.
Mr. Parsons: Well yes, I do have a number
of questions, but perhaps first you could give
me a brief overview I’d like to get a little bit
of an idea of your background.
Rebecca: yes of course. Well as you can see
from the resume I’m up and grew up in
Brooklyn, New York, although our family
moved to London when I was quite young, at
around rook.
Mr. Parsons: Ah I see, so you were actually
educated in Europe?
Rebecca: yes precisely. Although I was born
in the US, I would definitely call London
home. But as you see I’ve actually spent a
lot of my life moving from country to
country. My Father was inthe oil business
before he retired so we also spent a number
of years in Saudi Arabia too.
Mr. Parsons: Very interesting. So it seems
you had quite an adventurous childhood.
Rebecca: Absolutely! We were never still for
too long. But now I’m really looking to settle
down.
Mr. Parsons: I see. Okay, well let’s move on
to discuss your education shall we?
Rebecca: Sure.
