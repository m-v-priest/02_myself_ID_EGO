== Elementary ‐Daily Life ‐ Car Trouble 汽车故障 (C0221)

A: Car trouble center. How may I help you?

B: My car won’t start! Stupid old car!

A: Hold on, before you kick your car let’s *go
through* 检查 some possible problems.

B: Fine.

A: Ok, first of all, can you turn the key in the
ignition  着火，点燃；点火装置，点火开关?

[.my2]
您能转动点火开关的钥匙吗？

B: Yeah! I am here with my friend and he
thinks it may be the _spark 火花，火星 plug_ 火花塞 or the _starter
motor_ 启动马达.

[.my2]
他认为可能是火花塞或启动马达的问题。

[.my1]
.案例
====
- spark plug +

- starter motor +
image:/img/starter motor.jpg[,15%]
====

A: Those are possible problems, but tell me,
when you turn the key, do you hear the
_starter motor_ 启动马达  crank  (v.)转动（内燃机的）曲轴?

B: Yeah, it sounds like it usually does when I
start the car, but nothing else happens. The
engine won’t start. Should I maybe press (v.) the
accelerator 油门；催化剂；[机] 加速装置?

[.my2]
能，听起来就像平时启动车时的声音，但其他什么也没发生。发动机就是发动不了。我是不是该踩油门？

A: No. If you step on the _accelerator pedal_ 油门踏板
you can flood the carburetor 汽化器；化油器 and your car will
never start.

[.my2]
不要。如果您踩油门，可能会淹没化油器，您的车就永远发动不了了。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.carburetor
-> 来自词根carb, 碳。-ure, 名词后缀。-etor, 名词后缀。

化油器(Carburetor)是一種把燃料混入空氣的裝置。

為什麼引擎要在燃燒前, 把"燃料"和"空氣"預先混合好呢？**要燃料完全在氣缸中燃燒，就必須想辦法加大表面積。如果可以把燃料化作霧氣一般，每一小滴的燃料四週, 就會有非常充足的空氣, 可以提供燃燒時需要的氧氣，有接近無限大的表面積。**那么有沒有方法可以不間斷地將燃料化為霧氣？"化油器"就可以做到.
====

B: So what do you think it is?

A: I know this may seem like a silly 愚蠢的，傻的 question,
but does your car have gasoline 汽油?

B: Umm. yeah! Right! I got the car started 我把车发动起来了!
Thanks for your help! I told you to fill the
tank!

====
A _carbon footprint_ is the total amount of greenhouse (a.)温室效应的 gases (including _carbon dioxide_ and methane 甲烷，沼气) that are generated by our actions.

碳足迹是由我们的作用产生的温室气体（包括二氧化碳和甲烷）的总数。

The average carbon footprint for a person in the United States is 16 tons, one of the highest rates in the world. Globally, the average carbon footprint is closer to 4 tons. To have the best chance of avoiding a 2℃ rise in global temperatures, the average global _carbon footprint_ per year needs to drop to under 2 tons by 2050.

美国一个人的平均碳足迹是16吨，是世界上最高的碳足迹之一。在全球范围内，平均碳足迹接近4吨。为了避免全球温度升高2 2的最佳机会，到2050年，全球平均碳足迹需要下降到2吨以下。

community_ (社区，社会) 科学界 says that the earth is heating up.
We need to make some drastic 剧烈的；极端的 changes to
our lifestyle 生活方式 if we want to preserve our
planet.

[.my2]
这很严重，伙计。有大量的科学研究，科学界也指出地球正在变暖。如果我们想要保护我们的星球，就需要对我们的生活方式做出一些剧烈的改变。

A: I don’t know. It sounds like a bunch of
_mumbo 废话，胡言乱语 jumbo_ (a.巨大的；特大的) 晦涩难懂的话；胡言乱语 if you ask me. ”Save the
earth!” The earth will save itself. It’s survived
worst disasters in the past. I mean, honestly,

[.my2]
我们住在乡下。这里的人不可能步行或骑自行车去上班，尤其是在冬天。而且我们也没有公交系统。我的房子有40年了，要把它改造成“环保”和“节能”的，需要花很多钱。

C: Well I don’t really know if I *believe in*
global warming either, or *whether or not* it
was our doing or a natural change 后定  the earth
is going through, but you have to admit that
we’re living pretty irresponsibly 不负责任地 here in the
west.

[.my2]
我也不确定我是否相信全球变暖，或者这是我们的行为还是地球正在经历的自然变化.

A: I guess...

[.my2]
我想是吧


C: I think _the issue at hand_ 当前的问题；手头的问题 is sustainability (n.)持续性，能维持性.
We’ve only got this one earth we can live on,
and our resources are quickly disappearing
#because of# ①our own carelessness  粗心大意 ② #and# our

man.

[.my2]
是的，拉尔夫，仔细听好了。这很重要，你不想再回到监狱里，对吧？你的角色在这里非常重要，我们都在依赖你，伙计。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.mothball
樟脑丸的英文名字。其实，它叫mothball[ˋmɔθbɔl]。Moth这个词原本是“蛾”的意思，因为樟脑丸主要是用来防衣蛾的，所以在英文中用了这个字。不过，这里的樟脑是指从樟树中提取的物质。原本的樟脑丸应该是用天然樟树提取物制成的，但现在大部分便宜的樟脑丸都是化学合成的。

樟脑丸（英语：Mothball），又称卫生球、卫生丸、防蛀球、臭蛋、臭丸，*是一类用作杀虫剂、除臭剂的球状固体，主要用于防治衣物中的虫害（主要是衣蛾）和防霉。* 樟脑丸得名自"樟树"树干中含有的"樟脑"。

过去的卫生球使用易燃的"萘"(nài) 与"萘酚"，因此又称为萘丸；现在则大部分被对"二氯苯"所取代。

- 成人食入2克"樟脑"即可引发严重中毒，食入4克可致命。 +
- "萘"的致死剂量估计在1-2克左右。
- 对"二氯苯"的毒性较萘低，成人可以承受20克的口服剂量。美国卫生及公共服务部认为，*对"二氯苯"可以“合理推定为致癌物质”。*

image:/img/mothball.jpg[,15%]

另外，由于现在使用樟脑丸的人不多，这个词也被用来指那些已经收起来不用的东西。用法是bemothballed 或 be put into mothballs。


- The smell of mothballs is very pungent. (樟脑丸的味道很刺鼻。)
- The expensive blender （美）搅拌机；掺和者；混合物 I bought three years ago `谓` has been mothballed. (我三年前买的昂贵果汁机, 已经被束之高阁。)

.This here
这个：指代离说话者较近的某个物体或事物。

.slammer
-> 俚语，来自 slam,关门，猛关，猛摔。

for the manager. Now, according to Jimmy,
the bank manager is leaving early on
Tuesday ’cause it’s his wedding anniversary 周年纪念（日）.
He and the wife are having a romantic
rendezvous （尤指秘密的）约会，会面 in the country, so any packages
delivered will be left unopened  未开启的，未打开的 in his office
until he gets back late on Wednesday. . . .

[.my2]
对，你进入箱子。我会确保它被完全密封，然后假扮成送货员，我会为经理投递一个“特殊包裹”。现在，根据吉米的情报，银行经理周二会提前离开，因为那天是他的结婚纪念日。他和妻子会在乡下进行一次浪漫的约会，所以任何投递的包裹, 都会原封不动地留在他的办公室，直到他周三晚回来……



Sammy: . . . . . . Which gives us access to

my life with you! I can’t wait for all the
adventures we’re going to have, for all the
fights and the laughter. I can’t wait to grow
old and wrinkly with you.

B: Oh Jared! I can’t wait for our wedding! I
hope you don’t mind, but I’ve already chosen
a date! Six months from now in the summer!
Melissa saw you buying the ring last month
so I’ve had plenty of time to start planning!

A: She what?

B: Oh don’t worry sweetie, I didn’t know
when you were going to propose. It was still
a nice surprise! As I was saying, I’ve got it all
planned out. There’s almost nothing left to
do! I wrote up our guest list and we will have
roughly four hundred guests
attending.

A: four hundred?

B: No need to sweat it. My parents agreed to
pay for most of the wedding, which is going
to be low budget anyway. So roughly four
hundred people, which means that the hall at
Northwood Heights will be our reception
venue. I thought it would be nice if we had
the wedding at your parents’ church and my
uncle of course would be officiating. We’ll
meet with him soon for some pre-wedding
counseling. The music for the wedding
ceremony was a no-brainer. My step-sister
and her string quartet will take care of that.
My cousin will be the official photographer. I
thought it would also be nice if his daughter
could sing a solo. Did you know that she’s
going to be a professional opera singer?

A: Ah...

B: And then of course the ladies at the
church would love to be our caterers for the
banquet and we’ll get the Youth Group to
serve us. I was thinking that your friend’s
band could be our entertainment for the
night. though they might have to tone it
down a bit. Or we could hire a DJ. Your
sister’s husband could get us a discount with
that company that does the decor at
weddings. What’s their name again? I was
thinking that we could have an island
paradise- themed wedding and our theme
color would be a soothing blue like
Aquamarine.
And there will be a huge seashell on the wall
behind the podium where we’ll make our
toasts! What do you think of small packages
of drink mixes for our wedding favors? Who
else am I missing? Oh, your uncle could be
our florist and his wife could make our
wedding cake!

A: Wow.

B: See? It’s going to be wonderful! Oh this
wedding is going to be everything I ever
dreamed of.

A: If I survive the next six months.

impressive sandcastle by the time we leave.
Don’t stray too far. Wait! Leave your sandals
here or put on your wet shoes.

A: And stay in the shallow area. I don’t want
to see you go any farther than that sandbar!
It’s too deep out there and we didn’t bring
your floaties.

B: You’re back already? The water was too
cold, huh? I’ll tell you a secret. Do you see
that small pool of water over there? It’ll be
warmer in there. Go see if you can find some
seashells or catch some minnows.

down right now! It could sting you!

== Elementary ‐Daily Life ‐ Buying Women’s Shoes (C0231)
Mom: Hi, excuse me Miss? I’m looking for a
dress shoe. My usual pair that I’ve had for
years have finally been stretched out of
shape. They don’t provide any support
anymore.
Salesgirl: Sure, what kind of shoe are you
looking for? We’ve got strappy sandals, sleek
75
Englishpod Dialogues
high heels, edgy pumps, or if you’re looking
for something a little more practical, we’ve
got Mary Janes, ballerinas.
Mom: Show me some classic high heels,
please.
Salesgirl: Ok, right this way. What color did
you have in mind?
Mom: Black. Classic.
Salesgirl: Of course. We’ve got this style
here that is very popular. Because it’s an
open-toe shoe, you can wear it any time of
the year. They look great on everyone.
Mom: Umm. too shiny. And I wear
pantyhose with my shoes so let’s look for a
closed-toe shoe.
Salesgirl: Ok, these are a very nice pair of
leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they
are very comfortable.
Mom: I don’t like the pointed toes. Let me
take a look at what else you have. Too high.
That one looks like the back would cut into
my heel. I have a high instep so I doubt that
one will fit properly. I don’t want bows. I find
slingbacks very uncomfortable. Those might
as well be stilettos. Too modern. Ah, finally,
this is what I’m looking for.
Salesgirl: What size?
Mom: Seven-and-a-half.
Salesgirl: Here we are How does it fit?
Mom: Hmmm. not good. They’re too tight.
The length is right, but the shoe is too
narrow and it’s pinching my toes. And there’d
be no room for my insoles. You know what? I
don’t think I have the patience for this today.
They just don’t make shoes like they used to.
I’ll come back another time.
Salesgirl: Have a nice day, Ma’am.

blocked up as well – I really feel terrible.

breathe in and out slowly for me while I
listen to your chest? You really are all bunged
up, you don’t sound too good at all. Ok I’m
going to set you up with a bunch of
antibiotics. You will need to take these

every evening. You will also have to take this
cough medicine three times a day after
meals. Finally, I am giving you an inhaler to

Jill: Alex, what’s up with you? You look
dreadful!
Alex: Hey Jill, I don’t know. I’ve been having
trouble sleeping these past few weeks. I
usually lie in bed for hours trying to get to
sleep . I’ve tried stretching and different
breathing techniques before going to bed .
I’ve tried eating and not eating different
foods. I’ve even tried counting sheep! And
then when I finally get to sleep , I have these
really disturbing nightmares, so I usually
wake up in a panic and more tired than
before I went to sleep .
Jill: Wow, maybe you should get that
checked out. Maybe you’re stressed?

C: Just take some sedatives! Works for me!
Every so often having some melatonin on
hand helps me when I have trouble sleeping.
It works on all kinds of sleeping disorders.
It’s the stuff pilots use to regulate their
sleeping patterns.
Jill: I heard of that. But does that apply to
Alex’s situation?

C: Ya sure, why not? Sounds like he only has
transient insomnia since it’s a recent thing so
taking melatonin do the trick.
Jill: But shouldn’t he be looking into WHY it’s
been happening?

C: Well aren’t you the little psychologist? Our
buddy’s having trouble sleeping, it’s easy and
curable. It’s not something freakish like if he
was a sleepwalker.

== Elementary ‐Daily Life ‐ Morning Routine (C0237)
Jacob: Stephanie! Did you just get to
school? But you were up and about when I
left the dorm this morning! That was about
an hour and a half ago. This happens all the
time! Why do you always take so long to get
ready the morning?
Stephanie: It’s a skill. What can I say? I
don’t know why, I just have a long routine.
Jacob: Please explain because it makes no
sense to me. How can a girl’s routine be so
complicated? You get up, you shower, you
get dressed , you brush your teeth, you’re
out the door. Half an hour, tops.
Stephanie: Jacob, you have the luxury of
having a haircut that rarely needs styling. I
don’t. I have to set aside about an hour and
a half to get ready in the mornings. Every
day, I wake up and head straight for the
shower. Every second day, I wash my hair. If
it’s a hair-washing day, I frequently need to
wash my hair twice because it gets really
oily. Then I usually put in a conditioner and
have to rinse that out too. Because my hair
is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower
in under twenty minutes. Afterwards, I often
put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I
wait for it to brew. I take a long time to get
dressed in the morning. Every now and then
I remember to choose my outfit the night
before , but usually I do it in the morning. In
all, getting dressed takes about half an
hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry
so then I have to style my hair. From time to
time I’ll put my hair up, but oftentimes I
blowdry it straight. And then, because of the
texture of my hair, I regularly have to flatiron
it to keep it from frizzing. That’s another
twenty minutes or so. After that, I have my
daily makeup routine.
Jacob: True, I hardly ever see you without
your hair done and your makeup on, even
when you show up to class in sweatpants.
Tell me, how long does it take you to choose
that outfit in the morning?

Mr. Parsons: Now, Miss Childs passed on

to look it over and I must say I’m quite
impressed.
Rebecca: Thank you very much. I’ve tried to
keep it short and clear. If there’s any
questions please feel free to ask me.
Mr. Parsons: Well yes, I do have a number
of questions, but perhaps first you could give
me a brief overview I’d like to get a little bit
of an idea of your background.
Rebecca: yes of course. Well as you can see
from the resume I’m up and grew up in
Brooklyn, New York, although our family
moved to London when I was quite young, at
around rook.
Mr. Parsons: Ah I see, so you were actually
educated in Europe?
Rebecca: yes precisely. Although I was born
in the US, I would definitely call London
home. But as you see I’ve actually spent a
lot of my life moving from country to
country. My Father was inthe oil business
before he retired so we also spent a number
of years in Saudi Arabia too.
Mr. Parsons: Very interesting. So it seems
you had quite an adventurous childhood.
Rebecca: Absolutely! We were never still for
too long. But now I’m really looking to settle
down.
Mr. Parsons: I see. Okay, well let’s move on
