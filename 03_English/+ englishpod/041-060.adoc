chance was to fight back!

A: So, Casey, how are things going with the
photos for the press kit?

B: Yeah, I’ve been meaning to talk to you
about that. I might need to ask for an
extension on that deadline.

A: You’ve had over a month to get this
finalized! Why are things delayed?

B: Well, the thing is, we ran into a lot of
problems. . .

A: I’m not looking for excuses here. I just
want to get this finished on time!

B: I know, and I apologize for the delay. But
some things were just beyond my control. I
had trouble booking the photographer, and
then Michael was sick for three weeks, so I
couldn’t include him in the photos, and the
design team lost all the files, so I had to redo
the pictures.

A: I’m not going to put this off any longer,
Casey! I want those photos ASAP!

don’t think he’s seeing someone else, do

== 047. Elementary ‐ Advanced ‐ Just In Time Strategy (E0047)

A: I called this meeting today in order to
discuss our manufacturing plan. As I’m sure
you’re all aware, with the credit crunch, and
the global financial crisis, we’re obligated to
look for more cost efficient ways of producing
our goods. We don’t want to have to be
looking at redundancies. So, we’ve outlined a
brief plan to implement the just-in-time
philosophy.

B: We have two basic points that we want to
focus on. First of all, we want to reduce our
lead time.

C: Why would want to do that? I think this is
not an area that really needs to be worked
on.

B: Well, we want to reduce production and
delivery lead timesfor better overall
efficiency.

A: Right, production lead times can be
reduced by moving work stations closer
together, reducing queue length, like for
example, reducing the number of jobs
waiting to be processed at a given machine,
and improving the coordination and
cooperation between successive processes.
Delivery lead times can be reduced through
close cooperation with suppliers, possibly by
inducing suppliers to locate closer to the
factory or working with a faster shipping
company.

C: I see& That makes sense.

B: The second point is that we want to
require supplier quality assurance and
implement a zero defects quality program.
We currently have far too many errors that
lead to defective items and therefore, they
must be eliminated. A quality control at the
source program must be implemented to
give workers the personal responsibility for
the quality of the work they do, and the
authority to stop production when something
goes wrong.

C: I’m with you on this one. It’s essential
that we reduce these errors; we’ve got to
force our suppliers to reduce their mistakes.

A: Exactly. Well, let’s look at how we’re going
to put this plan into action. First...(fade out)
