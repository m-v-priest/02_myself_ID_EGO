== 047. Elementary ‐ Advanced ‐ Just In Time Strategy (E0047)

A: I called this meeting today *in order 目的是；以便；为了 to*
discuss our manufacturing 制造，制造业 plan. As I’m sure
_you’re all aware_, with the _credit crunch_ (压碎声；碎裂声;紧要关头；困境；症结；令人不快的重要消息)信贷紧缩, and
the global financial crisis, we’re obligated (a.)（道义或法律上）有义务的，有责任的，必须的 *to
look for* more cost efficient ways of producing (v.)
our goods. We don’t want to have to be
*looking at* redundancies (n.)（因劳动力过剩而造成的）裁员，解雇. So, we’ve outlined a
brief plan to implement (v.)执行，贯彻 the just-in-time (a.)适时（制）（只有在需要时,才将零部件或原材料送货到厂）;无库存制度
philosophy .

[.my2]
我今天召开会议是为了讨论我们的生产计划。我相信你们都知道，在信贷紧缩, 和全球金融危机的情况下，我们有义务寻找更具成本效益的方式, 来生产我们的产品。我们不想看到裁员。因此，我们概述了一个实现准时制哲学的简短计划。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.We don’t want to have to *be looking at* redundancies.
进行时态（"be looking at"）突出了动作正在进行, 或者可能**"在未来某一段时间持续进行"的可能性。**在这个上下文中，"be looking at redundancies" 表示他们不希望进入“不得不认真考虑裁员”的状态，强调一种不愿进入的长期情境或过程。

如果改成
"We don’t want to have to *look at* redundancies": +
"look at redundancies" 会显得更为果断，强调"**立即需要**进行裁员"的可能性。 +
“我们不希望不得不考虑裁员。”
这听起来更明确，可能让语气显得更为严肃和紧迫。

总结: +

"be looking at"	更柔和，强调一种可能会持续的状态或情境，适合表示希望避免进入这种阶段。 +
"look at"	更直接，强调裁员这个动作本身，语气更果断，听起来更紧迫。
====


B: We have two _basic points_ that we want to
focus on. First of all, we want to reduce our
_lead time_ 订货交付时间.

[.my2]
我们有两个基本点要重点关注。首先，我们想缩短交货时间。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Lead Time
前置时间（Lead time）是供应链管理中的一个术语，*是指从"采购方"开始下单订购, 到"供应商"交货, 所间隔的时间*，通常以天数或小时计算。

image:/img/Customer-Lead-Time.png[,100%]
====


C: Why would want to do that? I think this is
not an area that really needs *to be worked on* 努力改善（或完成）.

B: Well, we want to reduce production and
delivery _lead times_ for better overall
efficiency 效率，效能.

[.my2]
我们想缩短生产和交货时间，以提高整体效率。

A: Right, production _lead times_ can be
reduced by moving work stations closer
together, reducing queue （人、汽车等的）队，行列 length, like for
example, reducing the number of jobs
waiting to be processed at a given machine,
and improving the coordination 协作；协调；配合 and
cooperation 合作；协作 between successive (a.)连续的；接连的；相继的 processes. +
Delivery _lead times_ can be reduced through
_close cooperation_ 密切合作 with suppliers, possibly by
inducing (v.)劝说，诱使 suppliers to locate (v.) closer to the
factory or *working with* a faster shipping
company.

[.my2]
是的，生产提前期可以通过将工作站移得更近，减少队列长度，例如，减少在给定机器上等待处理的工作数量，以及改善连续过程之间的协调和合作来缩短。交货提前期可以通过与供应商的密切合作来缩短，可能是通过诱导供应商靠近工厂, 或与更快的运输公司合作。



C: I see & That makes sense 有意义;讲得通；有道理.

B: The second point is that we want to
require (v.)需要；要求做（某事），规定 supplier _quality assurance_ 质量保证 and
implement a _zero defects 缺点，缺陷，毛病 quality program_.
We currently have _far too many_ errors that
*lead to* defective (a.)有缺点的；有缺陷的；有毛病的 items and therefore, they
must be eliminated 被淘汰；消除；排除. A _quality control_ at _the
source program_ must be implemented to
give workers _the personal responsibility_ for
the quality of the work they do, and the
authority 权；职权 to stop production when something
goes wrong.

[.my2]
第二点是, 我们希望要求供应商提供"质量保证", 并实施"零缺陷质量计划"。我们目前有太多的错误导致有缺陷的产品，因此，它们必须被消除。必须实施源程序的质量控制，使工人对他们所做的工作的质量负责，并在出现问题时, 有权停止生产。

C: I’m with you on this one. It’s essential
that we reduce these errors; we’ve got to
force our suppliers to reduce their mistakes.

A: Exactly. Well, let’s look at how we’re going
to put this plan into action. First...(fade out)

so much! I’ve really missed you. I was wrong
to get upset over nothing.

B: I’m sorry I haven’t called or anything, but
right after you decided you wanted a break, I
was called up north to put out some major
forest fires! I was in the middle of nowhere,
working day and night, trying to prevent the
blaze from spreading! It was pretty intense.

have some exciting news... I think I’m
pregnant!

news! I’ve always wanted to be a father!
We’ll go to the doctor first thing in the
morning!

C: We have your test results back and,
indeed, you are pregnant. Let’s see here...

approximate due date is October twentyseventh
two thousand and nine, so that
means that the baby was conceived on
February third, two thousand and nine.

B: Are you sure? Are these things accurate?

C: Well, yes sir, they are.

A: What’s wrong? Why are you asking these
questions?

B: This baby isn’t mine! I was away the first
week of February at a training seminar!
