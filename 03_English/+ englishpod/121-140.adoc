== Elementary ‐ Global View ‐ Presidential Speech (C0121)

A: Good evening, my fellow Americans.
Three days from now, after a half-century of
service of our country, I shall lay down the
responsibilities of office as, in a traditional
and solemn ceremony, the authority of the
Presidency is vested in my successor. This
evening I come to you with a message of
leave-taking and farewell, and to share a few
final thoughts with you, my countrymen.

A: Like every other citizen, I wish the new
President, and all who will labor with him,
Godspeed. I pray that the coming years will
be blessed with peace and prosperity for all.

A: Our people expect their President and the
Congress to find essential agreement on
questions of great importance, the wise
resolution of which will better shape the
future of our great nation. My own relations
with Congress began on a remote and
tenuous basis when, long ago, a member of
the Senate appointed me to West Point. I
then had the pleasure of building more
intimate relationship with Congress during
the war and immediate post-war period.
Finally, we have progressed to the mutually
interdependent relationship we’ve had during
these past eight years.

fewer. It looks like you have more than
fifteen items there.

Fifty dollars would be great.

dollars and thirty-three cents. Here is your

== Elementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ Tools (C0124)

A: Alright, ladies and gentlemen. We’ve been
hired to build a deck on this here house, and
turn this boring and drab lawn into a
backyard oasis. There is one catch, though.
We’ve only got one day to finish this, so I’m
gonna need everyone to give one hundred
and ten percent today. It’s going to be tough,
but we’ve got a great team here, and I know
that together we can tackle this project. That
being said, let’s get to work!

B: That’s right. Now, remember, we’ve been
over the plans, but we really need to make
sure that everything is up to code. The home
inspectors here are pretty thorough, so
please make sure you follow the plans
exactly. And remember the carpenter’s rule
of thumb: measure twice and cut once.

A: Okay, guys. Let’s get at it. Bob! Pass me
that hammer! The nails won’t go in; the
wood is too hard. I think I’m gonna need the
nail gun. That did it!

C: Do me a favor and help me cut this twoby-
four, will ya? Pass me the circular saw,
and grab hold of the end of the board. Now
help me drill some holes in it so we can place
the bolts.

B: I think you should sand the edges. Look
at all these splinters, someone could get
hurt. Geez...you gotta take pride in your
work!

C: Yeah, you’re right. Pass me the sander
and I’ll take care of it.

A: Julia! Get over here with the level,
measuring tape and that box of screws!

C: Oh, no! Look out below!

== Elementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ No Smoking! (C0125)

A: It smells like an ashtray in here!

B: Hi honey! What’s wrong? Why do you
have that look on your face?

A: What’s wrong? I thought we agreed that
you were gonna quit smoking.

B: No! I said I was going to cut down which
is very different. You can’t just expect me to
go cold turkey overnight!

A: Look, there are other ways to quit. You
can try the nicotine patch, or nicotine
chewing gum. We spend a fortune on
cigarettes every month and now laws are
cracking down and not allowing smoking in
any public place. It’s not like you can just
light up like before.

B: I know, I know. I am trying but, I don’t
have the willpower to just quit. I can’t fight
with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes
in the morning with coffee or after lunch!
Please understand?

A: Fine! I want a divorce!

== Elementary‐ Global View ‐ Presidential Speech II (C0129)

A: We now stand ten years past the midpoint
of a century that has witnessed four major
wars among great nations. Three of these
involved our own country. Despite the
carnage of these conflicts, America is today
the strongest, the most influential and most
productive nation in the world. We are
understandably proud of this preeminence,
yet we realize that America’s leadership and
prestige depend, not merely upon our
unmatched material progress, riches and
military strength, but on how we use our
power in the interests of world peace and
human betterment.

A: Throughout America’s adventure in free
government, such basic purposes have been
to keep the peace; to foster progress in
human achievement, and to enhance liberty,
dignity and integrity among peoples and
among nations.

A: We pray that peoples of all faiths, all
races, all nations, may have their great
human needs satisfied; that those now
denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to
the full; that all who yearn for freedom may
experience its spiritual blessings; that those
who have freedom will understand, also, its
heavy responsibilities; that all who are
insensitive to the needs of others will learn
charity; that the scourges of poverty, disease
and ignorance will be made to disappear
from the earth, and that, in the goodness of
time, all peoples will come to live together in
a peace guaranteed by the binding force of
mutual respect and love.

A: Now, on Friday noon, I am to become a
private citizen. I am proud to do so. I look
forward to it. Thank you, and good night.

== Elementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ Going To The Gym (C0130)

A: Hey there, you look a little lost. Are you
new here?

B: Yeah how’d you know?

A: You can always spot the newbies. I can
give you a few pointers if you want. Were
you trying to use this machine here?

B: Yeah! I just started my training today and
I’m not really sure where to begin.

A: It’s ok, I know how it is. This machine
here will work out your upper body, mainly
your triceps and biceps. Are you looking to
develop strength or muscle tone and
definition?

B: Well, I don’t want to be ripped like you! I
just want a good physique with weights and
cardio.

A: In that case you want to work with less
weight. You can start off by working ten to
fifteen reps in four sets. Five kilo weights
should be enough. Now it’s very important
that you stretch before pumping iron or you
might pull a muscle.

B: Got it! Wow is that the weight you are
lifting? My goodness that’s a lot of weight!

A: It’s not that much. Just watch... I’m ok...

would you do if you won the lottery?

A: Let’s see.... If I won the lottery, I would
buy two tickets for a trip around the world.

B: If you buy me a ticket I will go with you

A: Howdy! Nice car! What seems to be the
problem?

B: I don’t know! This stupid old car started
spewing white smoke and it just died on me.
Luckily, I managed to start it up and drive it
here. What do you think it is?

A: Not sure yet. How about you pop the hood
and we can take a look. Hmmm, it doesn’t
look good.

B: What do you mean? My daddy gave me
this car for my birthday last month. It’s
brand new!

A: Well missy, the white smoke that you saw
is steam from the radiator. You overheated
your engine so now the pistons are busted
and so is your transmission. You should have
called us and we could have towed you over
here when your car died.

B: Ugh... So how long is this going to take?
An hour?

A: I’m afraid a bit more than that. We need
to order the spare parts, take apart your
electrical system, fuel pump and engine and
then put it back together again. You are
going to have to leave it here for at least two
weeks.

B: What! How am I supposed to get to
school or go shopping? This is not
happening!

== Elementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ Doing Laundry (C0133)

A: Ok, let’s go through this one more time. I
don’t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses!

B: I know, I know. OK, so I have to separate
the colors from the whites and put them in
this strange looking contraption so called
washing machine.

A: Right. You have to turn it on and program
it depending on what type of clothes you are
washing. For example for delicates, you
should set a shorter washing cycle. Also, be
sure to use fabric softener and this detergent
when washing.

B: So complicated! Ok, what about this red
wine stain? How do I get it out?

A: Since this is a white t-shirt, you can just
pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do
the trick.

B: Cool. Then I can just throw everything in
the dryer for an hour and its all set right?

A: No! Since you are washing delicates and
cotton, you should set the dryer to medium
heat and for twenty minutes.

B: You know what? I’ll just have everything
dry cleaned.

works. Three HDMI connectors, USB, VGA

without a doubt the complete home theater

B: This is exactly what I need! Can you
imagine watching movies or playing video

B: Carrie, are you ok? You seem a bit down.

A: I just got off the phone with my
boyfriend. He is always getting upset and
losing his temper over nothing. It’s so hard
to talk to him at times.

B: Maybe it’s just that he is stressed out
from work or something. He does have a
pretty nerve wracking job you know.

A: Yeah but, he is always in a really foul
mood. I try to find out what’s bothering him
or get him to talk about his day but, he
always shuts down and brushes me off.

B: Men are like that you know. They can feel
nervous, anxious or on edge and the only
way they can express it is by trying to hide it
through aggressiveness.

A: I guess you are right. What do you think I
should do? He wasn’t always this grouchy
you know...

is down and if that doesn’t work, I say get
rid of him and get a new one!

== Elementary ‐ Global View ‐ Gambling (C0136)

A: Did you hear? The state is thinking of
legalizing gambling in our city! Soon we are
gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here
which will be good for our business!

B: Are you serious? Gambling is a vice
industry built on deception and fed by the
intentional exploitation of human weakness
for the sole purpose of monetary gain! It
disgusts me.

A: What are you talking about? How does it
exploit people?

B: Well, to begin with, Gambling is addictive,
ruins marriages, destroys families and
bankrupts communities. Once you are
addicted it is very difficult to stop. People
have lost their houses, cars and been left out
on the street after becoming addicted.
Secondly, it exploits because men become
addicted to gambling most often because of
the action and risk. Women gamble to
escape, and senior citizens will start
gambling for the social interaction. Underage
gamblers often start gambling on sports with
friends and then illegal bookies.

A: Geez! Now that I think about it, maybe
legalizing gambling isn’t such a good idea!
Although, I have been to Las Vegas, and I
didn’t become addicted or anything like that.

B: You cannot predict who will become
addicted to gambling. Now excuse me, I
have a protest rally to organize!

The first one is the cheapest but most basic

B: I have no idea what kbps means. I just
want to be able to get online, play games
and chat with my friends. Oh, and watch
movies online as well.

A: Well, this connection might be a bit too
slow for your needs. I suggest you get the
premium package for fifty dollars a month
which includes a connection speed of two
megabytes. That way you can play games
online without any lag. This package also
includes a wireless router and a personal
firewall absolutely free!

Daddy: Ok, each player gets 16 pieces. You
can be the white ones and I’ll play with the
black pieces. Now in the front, you set up the
pawns. Those are the least valuable pieces
and can only move one space forward. When
you are about to capture another piece, it
can move one space diagonally.
Bobby: What about all these other pieces?
Daddy: See this one that looks like a tower?
It’s called the rook. The one with the tall hat
is called the bishop. See this little horsey?
This is called the knight, it’s a very important
piece so it’s best to not let your opponent
capture it.
Bobby: And these two? They are husband
and wife?
Daddy: That’s right! That’s the queen and
that’s the king. If the other player captures
