Defining what constitutes Western Europe can be difficult. Indeed, what people think of as Western Europe has evolved over the course of time.

[.my2]
定义西欧的构成可能很困难。事实上，人们眼中的西欧已经随着时间的推移而演变。

|-> 二战期间
|During the two World Wars, Western Europe generally referred to the Allied powers and neighboring neutral countries. Germany was excluded from this definition as it was an enemy state, as was Italy during WWII.

[.my2]
两次世界大战期间，西欧一般泛指"协约国"及其周边中立国。德国被排除在这一定义之外，因为它是敌国，就像二战期间的意大利一样。

|-> 冷战期间
|During the Cold War, however, the definition of Western Europe was expanded to include the former West Germany and Italy, as opposed to the Eastern bloc countries led by the Soviet Union.

The fall of the so-called Iron Curtain and the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union supposedly ended the division between east and west on the European continent. But even three decades after the fall of the Iron Curtain, it is not uncommon for people to talk of Eastern and Western Europe as they were defined during the Cold War.

[.my2]
然而，在冷战期间，西欧的定义, 扩大到包括"前西德"和意大利，而不是苏联领导的东欧集团国家。所谓铁幕的倒塌, 以及东欧和苏联共产主义的崩溃, 据称结束了欧洲大陆东西方的分裂。但即使在铁幕倒塌三十年后，人们谈论冷战期间定义的东欧和西欧也并不罕见。

|-> 如今，联合国对西欧的定义
|Today, the United Nations defines Western Europe in a way similar to the old Cold War definition, but excludes the UK, the Scandinavian countries, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece. The UN assigns these aforementioned countries to other subregions of Europe. The 9 Western European countries are:

Austria +
Belgium +
France +
Germany +
Liechtenstein +
Luxembourg +
Monaco +
Netherlands +
Switzerland +

[.my2]
如今，联合国对西欧的定义, 与冷战时期的定义类似，但不包括英国、斯堪的纳维亚国家、西班牙、葡萄牙、意大利和希腊。联合国将上述国家分配给欧洲其他次区域。因此, 西欧9个国家是： +
Austria 奥地利 +
Belgium 比利时 +
France 法国 +
Germany 德国 +
Liechtenstein 列支敦士登 +
Luxembourg 卢森堡 +
Monaco 摩纳哥 +
Netherlands 荷兰 +
Switzerland 瑞士 +
