For many Indigenous peoples, their religious belief systems were animistic, meaning the spiritual world resided not just in humans but also in animals, plants, and even rocks. This belief was very different from monotheism, in which all spiritual power resided in one single divine being.

Like humans, animals, and plants, the earth possessed sacred power; therefore, it could not be owned. The concept of owning land seemed nonsensical to many Indigenous groups, and their corresponding lack of emphasis on private property was one reason Europeans sometimes found it easy to lay claim to lands inhabited by native peoples.

对于许多原住民来说，许多宗教信仰体系, 都是"万物有灵论"的，这意味着"精神世界"不仅存在于人类之中，还存在于动物、植物, 甚至岩石中。这种信仰与"一神论"(如基督教)非常不同，"一神论"中所有的精神力量, 都存在于一个神圣的存在中。

和人类、动物、植物一样，大地也拥有神圣的力量。因此，它不能被拥有。对于许多原住民群体来说，"拥有土地"的概念似乎毫无意义，因此他们相应地缺乏对"私有财产"的重视，这就是欧洲人有时发现"很容易对原住民居住的土地提出要求"的原因之一。
