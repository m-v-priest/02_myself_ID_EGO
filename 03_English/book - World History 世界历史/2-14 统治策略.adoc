== (古罗马) 对敌战争的策略

proved quite successful.

罗马元老院制定了一些战争政策，事实证明这些政策相当成功。

'''

=== 分而治之

One was to divide and conquer. The Romans always tried to defeat one enemy at a time and avoid waging war against a coalition. Thus they often attempted to turn their enemies against each other.

一是分而治之。罗马人总是试图一次击败一个敌人，并避免与"敌人联盟"发动战争。因此，他们经常试图让敌人互相攻击。

'''

=== 打是为了谈, 用己方的胜利来作为谈判筹码

Another tactic was to negotiate from strength. Even after suffering enormous defeats in battle, Rome would continue a war until it won a major engagement and reach a position from which to negotiate for peace with momentum on its side.

另一种策略是, 通过实力进行谈判。即使在战斗中遭受巨大失败，罗马仍会继续战争，直到赢得一场重大交战， 并占据有利地位后再来进行和平谈判。

'''

===  建立殖民地, 作为边防线

Yet another successful strategy was to establish colonies in recently conquered lands to serve as the first line of defense if a region revolted against Rome.

另一个成功的策略, 是在最近被征服的土地上建立殖民地，作为第一道防线, 来防范一个地区的"反罗马者"。

'''

===  建立盟友

Romans also transformed former enemies into loyal allies who could enjoy self-government as long as they honored Rome’s other alliances and provided troops in times of war. Some even received Roman citizenship.

罗马人还将昔日的敌人变成了忠诚的盟友，只要他们尊重罗马的其他联盟者, 并在战争时期提供军队，他们就可以享受自治。有些人甚至获得了罗马公民身份。

'''

==  伊斯兰的统治策略

=== 在穆斯林还对管理国家缺乏经验的时候, 就暂时利用非穆斯林人, 直到他们失去利用价值为止.

Within the running of the state, too, many government officials in these early decades—in positions from tax collector to scribe at the court of the ruler—were non-Muslim holdovers from the Byzantines and Persians. They helped the early Muslim rulers establish and administer a government the size of which they had never experienced.

But by the eighth century they were rapidly being shunned in favor of Arabs. In some cases, non-Muslims were passed over for the best positions.

穆斯林最初对管理国家无经验, 就暂时利用许多非穆斯林者 — 拜占庭人和波斯人, 来做政府的官员, 从税吏, 到宫廷抄写员. 但到了8世纪，穆斯林统治者有了治国经验后,  就将非穆斯林者踢开. 在某些情况下，非穆斯林被排除在最佳职位之外.

'''

===  先暂时利用前朝文化, 来安抚前朝遗老, 之后再慢慢”去前朝化”

The culture started to change after the second Islamic civil war in the early 690s. The victors, a branch of the Umayyad family, began to make the empire look increasingly Arab. Their governmental reforms included the gradual removal of signs and symbols associated with the old Byzantine and Persian rulers, such as Christian crosses on coins ).

他们开始使帝国看起来越来越阿拉伯化。政府改革包括, 逐步取消与旧拜占庭和波斯统治者相关的标志和符号，例如硬币上的基督教十字架。

(如同共产党中国, 夺取江山后, 先临时让民国议会那一套短暂存在下去, 等时机成熟再废弃掉它们, 直接一党专政独裁.  又如同现现在中国, 去西方化，而宣扬中国传统的糟粕，国学, 中医等)

'''

===  扩张领土时, 优先通过和平协议的方式, 而非武力战争

Calling these events the “Arab-Muslim conquests” is somewhat misleading, however. While the first years of expansion did see several major battles, most of the territory came under Islamic control through peace agreements. Cities and regions agreed to terms of surrender that protected their residents, many of their belongings, and their right to practice their religion. 

大部分领土, 是通过"和平协议"受到伊斯兰控制的。只要对方同意投降，你(征服者) 就同意保护对方的居民、财产, 和其宗教权。

'''

===  对方只要缴税, 就能其继续保有其宗教信仰自由

Especially during the seventh century, the Muslims maintained a policy of noninterference toward the religious practices of subject populations. As long as they paid taxes to their new Muslim government, the conquered could live in the Islamic state and still practice their religion somewhat freely.

特别是在七世纪，穆斯林对臣民的宗教活动实行不干涉政策。只要他们向新的穆斯林政府纳税，被征服者就可以生活在伊斯兰国家，并且仍然可以自由地信奉他们的宗教。

'''

===  穆斯林一般不与非穆斯林结婚, 因此阻碍了穆斯林信徒数量的发展

What was it like for Indigenous peoples of captured territories to live under Islamic rule during the Umayyad and Abbasid periods? What is surprising is that the majority of these inhabitants were not Muslims themselves.

For example, a Muslim generally could not marry a non-Muslim under Islamic law, but if such a marriage occurred, a Muslim woman’s future husband had to convert to Islam to marry her, and the children of a Muslim husband had to be raised as Muslim. Thus, it seems likely that the process of conversion to Islam at this time was quite slow and that the Muslims remained a numeric minority for centuries even though they wielded the majority of power in the empire.

在倭马亚王朝和阿拔斯王朝时期，被占领领土上的原住民在伊斯兰统治下生活是什么样的？令人惊讶的是，这些居民中的大多数本身并不是穆斯林。

根据伊斯兰法律，穆斯林一般不能与非穆斯林结婚，但如果发生这种婚姻，穆斯林妇女未来的丈夫, 必须皈依伊斯兰教, 才能与她结婚. 而穆斯林丈夫的孩子, 必须以穆斯林的身份抚养长大。因此，此时皈依伊斯兰教的过程似乎相当缓慢，尽管穆斯林在帝国中掌握着多数权力，但几个世纪以来 他们仍然是少数。

'''

== 蒙元的统治策略

=== 四等人制, 用流动性的外族, 来统治汉族. 因为流动性, 外族对汉人就没有情感联系, 也不可能建立起深耕权势

Kublai Khan’s most drastic change was to replace the Confucian system of class distinctions based on economic function with one based on ethnicity. 

At the top of the Yuan class structure were Mongols, followed by non-Chinese people, who were Europeans or previous steppe inhabitants like the Jurchen, Tangut, and Khitan. 

The bottom two classes were Chinese people: those of Han ethnicity who had been ruled by the Jin in the north, and the remaining Song Chinese who lived in the south. Mongols could not marry people from these bottom two classes.

一等: 蒙古人

二等: 非汉族人，包括欧洲人,  或以前的草原人民，如女真人、西夏人和契丹人.

三等: 金人统治下的汉族

四等: 宋人

蒙古人不能与三等和四等人通婚.

In the Yuan dynasty, although some Chinese officials maintained their positions at the local level, the most lucrative and prestigious jobs were held primarily by Mongols and non-Chinese outsiders.

The Song Chinese, who were at the bottom of the four-class system, were governed by two administrators, one a Chinese person and one a Mongol or non-Chinese person. Both were imperial appointees. The Chinese administrator was under the supervision of and responsible to his counterpart. People in all these positions were rotated periodically, so they could not build up a power base. 

元朝的政府人员, 主要由外国人，而非汉人来担当。尽管在一些地方一级的职位，由汉人来担当. 但最赚钱、最有声望的职位, 主要由"蒙古人"和"非汉人的外来者"担任。

汉人族群由两名行政人员统治，一名是汉人(乙)，一名是蒙古人或非汉人(甲)。两人都是皇帝任命的。乙受甲的监督, 并对其负责. 甲乙的职位都是周期性轮换的，因此无法建立权力基础。

(汉族受到种族歧视和压制. 但从另一面来看, 元朝的国际化做的还是可以的, 有很多外国人在华, 甚至能从政做官. 你能想象现在西方人能在中国当市长, 省长, 部长的情形么? )

Some non-Chinese administrators over the Song had not intended to work in the Yuan government. They came seeking some favor, often the right to trade, in exchange for which the emperors required them to perform administrative tasks. Among these bureaucrats taken as hostages, most were Muslim traders from other parts of the Mongol Empire. Regardless of how well they did their jobs, such bureaucrats were not likely to bond with the population and create a power base from which to challenge imperial authority.

宋朝的一些非汉人管理者, 并不打算在元朝政府工作。他们是前来寻求一些好处的，通常是为了"贸易权"，作为交换，皇帝要求他们执行行政任务。他们中大多数都是来自蒙古帝国其他地区的穆斯林商人。不管他们的工作做得有多好，这些官僚不太可能与民众建立联系, 也不可能建立起挑战帝国的权力基础。

'''

===  短暂恢复科举制, 但用配额来限制汉人录取人数

Following Kublai’s death in 1294, his system’s flaws became apparent. In 1315, his great-grandson Buyantu reinstated the mandarin exam system. Non-Chinese people took different (and shorter) exams than the Chinese people, and between 25 and 50 percent of those who passed had to be non-Chinese people. The effect of this quota was magnified because Song Chinese people made up more than 90 percent of the population, according to Yuan censuses. Between the differences in the exams and the quota system, it was much easier for Mongols and non-Chinese to pass than for Chinese.

考试中, 规定配额, 25-50%必须为”非汉人”.

==  (西班牙) encomienda system 监护制 (16世纪初, 对殖民地开始执行)

By 1502, they had created the encomienda system.

到 1502 年，他们创建了"监护制"(encomienda).

The term encomienda comes from the Spanish word encomendar, which means “to entrust.” The encomienda was a system of entrusting valuable territories and peoples to those who had proven to the crown that they were worthy of that trust. The Spanish government gave each grantee, known as an encomendero, the right to demand labor from Indigenous people living in a specific area. In exchange, the Spaniards were supposed to provide guidance, education, and leadership to these Native Americans. 

While encomiendas did not technically include the ownership of any land, encomenderos often took possession of lands where the people under their control lived. Sometimes the system of forced labor even devolved into what was functionally, if not legally, slavery.

“encomienda”一词源自西班牙语“encomendar”，意思是“委托”。Encomienda 是一种将宝贵的领土和人民, 委托给那些向王室证明自己值得信赖的人的制度。西班牙政府赋予每位受赠者（称为encomendero）在特定区域内要求土著人民提供劳动力的权利。作为交换，这些西班牙人应该为这些美洲原住民提供指导、教育和领导。

尽管encomienda制度在技术上并不包括对任何土地的所有权，但encomenderos通常会占有他们控制下人民所居住的土地。有时，这种强迫劳动制度, 甚至演变为事实上（尽管在法律上并非如此）的奴隶制。

The Spanish often mistreated Native Americans, but writers from Spain’s colonial rivals, most notably the English, frequently exaggerated Spanish cruelty to justify their own colonial abuses.

西班牙人经常虐待美洲原住民，但来自西班牙殖民竞争对手（尤其是英国人）的作家, 经常夸大西班牙人的残酷行为，以证明自己的殖民虐待行为是正当的。

'''

==  (西班牙) 探索美洲时, 所采用的模式 → encomendero

Spain’s exploration of the new continents continued, led by conquistadors. Some of these explorers were nobles or had military training and had fought against the Muslims in Spain; others were landless and wished to improve their lot in life.

西班牙在征服者的带领下, 继续探索(美洲)新大陆。这些探险家中有些是贵族，有些受过军事训练，曾在西班牙与穆斯林作战；有些则曾受过军事训练。其他人则没有土地，希望改善生活。

One instrument by which the Spanish government compensated conquistadors was the encomienda, a hereditary grant that entitled the holder, called an encomendero, to the labor of a specified number of conquered people, or to a tribute of precious metals or agricultural produce.

西班牙政府用来补偿征服者(探险者)的一种手段, 是委托制度（encomienda），这是一种世袭的特权，授予持有人（称为委托领主，encomendero）"从指定数量的被征服人民中,获取劳动力"的权利，或者获得贵金属, 或农产品的贡赋。

==  (葡萄牙) 进行联盟, 以分化瓦解敌人(印度)

Establishing a pattern that they and other Europeans later replicated throughout India, the Portuguese sought to divide and conquer by entering into alliance with some local rulers to the disadvantage of others, a strategy made easier in later decades by the weakening of the Mughal Empire.

葡萄牙人建立了一种后来在印度各地复制的模式，他们试图通过与一些当地统治者结盟, 而不利于其他统治者, 来分而治之，这种策略在后来的几十年中, 随着莫卧儿帝国的衰弱, 而变得更加容易。

'''

==  (法国) 与北美原住民结盟

The French probably enjoyed the friendliest relationships with Native Americans of any European colonizers. Unlike their rivals, they usually attempted to solve the shortage of labor by allying themselves with Native Americans.

Also, because few French women came to New France, many French colonists married Native American women, leading to the creation of a multicultural and multiracial society.

在所有欧洲殖民者中，法国人与美洲原住民的关系, 可能是最友好的。与竞争对手不同，他们通常试图通过与美洲原住民结盟, 来解决劳动力短缺问题。 +
此外，由于很少有法国妇女来到新法兰西，许多法国殖民者与美洲原住民妇女结婚，导致了多元文化和多种族社会的建立。

In 1627, Cardinal Richelieu, chief minister to King Louis XIII, provided a spiritual justification for Franco-Indian partnerships in the Ordonnance of 1627. The Ordonnance read in part, “The descendants of the French who are accustomed to this country [New France], together with all the Indians who will be brought to the knowledge of the faith and will profess it, shall be deemed and renowned natural Frenchmen, and as such may come to live in France when they want, and acquire, donate, and succeed and accept donations and legacies, just as true French subjects, without being required to take letters of declaration of naturalization.”

1627年，法国国王路易十三的首相红衣主教黎塞留, 在1627年《敕令》中, 为法印（法国与印第安人）合作提供了精神上的理由。《敕令》部分内容写道：“那些习惯于此地（新法兰西）的法国后裔，以及所有将被引导了解该信仰, 并承认该信仰的印第安人，应被视为并被称为天然的法国人，作为法国人，他们可以在任何时候来到法国定居，拥有、捐赠、继承和接受赠予和遗产，就像真正的法国臣民一样，而无需申请归化声明书。”(如同英国人将香港人视为英联邦子民)

==  殖民地地位, 在工业化时代时, 发生了变化 → 母国人不再到殖民地定居了, 不像早期时英国人移民到北美那样

The new colonies were quite different from those that European powers had established in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It was not generally expected that large numbers of Europeans would relocate to Africa or Asia and make permanent homes there, and the colonies were not intended to have quite the same relationship to the home country that earlier “settler colonies” had had. The U.S. treatment of the Philippines and Filipinos was fundamentally different from what North American colonists had experienced from Great Britain, for example. The industrial nations intended to exploit the resources and people of the colonies they established, not settle them.

19世纪的殖民地, 与早期16,17世纪的殖民地有很大不同. 人们一般认为, 欧洲人不会移民到亚非的殖民地来定居. 母国对这些殖民地的定位, 也不同于早期两者的关系. 例如, 美国对菲律宾的态度, 就完全同于早年英国对北美殖民地的态度. 工业化国家只是想利用殖民地的资源, 而非在那里定居, 来发展殖民地. (即更加功利化，将殖民地"工具化")

Politically: Repeated breach of pledges to give the natives a fair and reasonable share in the higher administration of their own country, which has much shaken confidence in the good faith of the British word. Political aspirations and the legitimate claim to have a reasonable voice in the legislation and the imposition and disbursement of taxes, met to a very slight degree, thus treating the natives of India not as British subjects, in whom representation is a birthright. Consequent on the above, an utter disregard of the feelings and views of the natives.

(印度对英国的看法: ) 政治上：一再违反"给予当地人合理、公平参与本国(印度)高层管理"的承诺，极大地动摇了人们对英国信誉的信心。政治诉求, 和要求在立法、税收征收与分配中拥有合理发言权的合法主张，仅得到了极少的回应，这表明印度人不被视为英国臣民，而"代表权"是英国人与生俱来的权利。因此，当局对当地人民的情感和意见, 表现出完全无视。

The natives call the British system Sakar ki Churi, the knife of sugar. That is to say, there is no oppression, it is all smooth and sweet, but it is the knife, notwithstanding.

当地人将英国的统治系统称为 Sakar ki Churi，即糖刀。也就是说，没有任何压迫感，一切都是顺滑而甜蜜的，但尽管如此，那依然是刀。

There were some exceptions. The North African colony of Algeria, which France had taken control of in 1830, was incorporated as part of France in 1848. Many French people and other Europeans immigrated to the coastal regions of Algeria and Tunisia with government encouragement in the nineteenth century. Many Europeans also settled in the British and Dutch colonies in southern Africa. However, this was not the imperial norm.

也有一些例外。1830年法国占领的北非殖民地阿尔及利亚, 于1848年并入了法国。19世纪，在政府的鼓励下，许多法国人和其他欧洲人, 移民到阿尔及利亚和突尼斯的沿海地区。许多欧洲人也在南非的英国和荷兰殖民地定居。然而，这并不是帝国的常态。
