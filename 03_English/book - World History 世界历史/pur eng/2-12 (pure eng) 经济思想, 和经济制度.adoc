==  丝绸之路

The Silk Roads in the First Century CE.


image:/img/0018.jpg[,100%]

The Silk Roads network was not a single route but many, including caravan routes that linked to the main trading regions, oasis towns, and overseas routes—the so-called Maritime Silk Roads—throughout the Indian Ocean.

Given the length of the route, few merchants covered it in its entirety. Goods changed hands many times over these long distances, being exchanged between merchants who each traveled only part of the “road,” and their price increased the farther they went from their origin.



The Silk Roads made up one of the greatest trade routes in world history, which reached its heyday between the fifth and eighth centuries. +
The Silk Roads facilitated the exchange of goods such as silk and spices, technologies such as papermaking, and cultural traditions and religions such as Buddhism and Islam.

==  重商主义 (16,17世纪流行)

=== Mercantilism 重商主义理论

In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, mercantilist theory was embraced by most European nations, especially France and England. Perhaps as much as religious fervor and a thirst for knowledge, this premise drove exploration and the establishment of colonies.

|-> 一个国家的金银越多, 越好 → 地球上的金银是有限的, 所以国家间的经济竞争就是零和博弈

|A nation’s power depended on the amount of gold and silver it held. The world’s wealth as measured in gold and silver was finite, so a gain for one nation was a loss for another. According to mercantilism, there could be only one victor in economic competition.



Because mercantilist theory saw economic gain for one nation as necessarily a loss for others, European nations engaged in trade wars as each tried to use tariffs to bar others from its markets.   +
At times, real wars accompanied trade wars. England and the Netherlands fought four wars over the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, partially to gain control of transatlantic trade. England also fought France for access to the markets of India.


|-> 如果积累金银? 保持"贸易顺差", 多出口, 少进口

|Amassing national wealth depended on maintaining a favorable balance of trade, a situation in which a country exports goods of greater value than it imports.  Indeed, the ideal was to import nothing and produce everything in the home country, including agricultural produce.


It elevated the interests of merchants and manufacturers over those of workers and consumers by arguing that wages should be kept low. More money would thus remain in employers’ hands, and people would be discouraged (or prevented) from buying luxury goods that could instead be exported for profit.


|-> 政府应该监管商业, 用关税来阻碍他国产品进口, 以帮助本国行业的发展
|
- Governments commonly prohibited certain imports to prevent them from competing with domestic industry. In 1539, for example, to protect domestic textile manufacturing, France banned the import of goods made of wool.
- Governments also imposed high tariffs, or taxes on imported goods. These made foreign products more expensive and thus promoted development of a nation’s own industries.



- Governments might also grant firms monopolies over certain kinds of domestic production, establish and provide financial support for certain industries to ensure domestic self-sufficiency, and pay for internal improvements, such as new roads, to promote domestic manufacturing and commerce.
- Like France, both England and the Netherlands granted monopolies on foreign trade to private companies—the British East India Company and the Dutch East India Company. The purpose was to prevent competition among merchants that might drive up the prices they were willing to pay for foreign goods and drive down the prices they charged for domestic goods sold abroad.




|-> 殖民地是必要的, 因为殖民地可以为母国提供原材料. 然后母国生产的产品, 可以卖给殖民地人民.(这就是对殖民地的剥削了)

|A colonial empire was necessary for economic domination. Colonies could supply raw materials for domestic consumption, so there was no need to purchase these resources from others. Colonial populations, in turn, provided a ready market for goods made in the home country.

To ensure that colonies added to their national wealth, European countries that established them usually required that they trade only with the home country. Thus, for example, England’s colonies in North America could sell what they produced only in England.



The industrializing powers could satisfy their needs for raw materials and markets only by reaching outside their borders to places in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Ocean. To amass large profits, however, they needed to extract raw materials at such low prices that it was unlikely Africans, Asians, and Pacific Islanders would consent to them. In addition, and also unlikely, these nations would have to agree to purchase manufactured goods from their industrialized partners even though they might be able to produce such things for themselves.

Business owners and politicians in industrialized nations thus believed they needed to gain control over these distant countries and rule them as part of an empire. Quite often, military conquest was the means by which they did so. Once these foreign territories were secured, markets established, and funds invested, the imperial powers then needed to prevent encroachment on their possessions by other industrial powers. This led to them to exercise even greater control over their colonies and often to attempt to conquer neighboring regions.

Great Britain, for example, competed with Russia for control of Afghanistan largely to limit Russian access to Britain’s prize colony of India.


The perceived need to extract raw materials from colonies to benefit the home country’s interests often led governments to restrict colonies’ economic growth.


|-> 殖民地只准与母国做生意, 以实现内循环.
|
- Spain exercised the strictest control over colonial commerce. Trade was limited to only a few ports in the Spanish colonies and the port of Seville in Spain.
- Those seeking to engage in trade had to procure a license to do so, at considerable expense.



|-> 发展海军和海外港口基地, 来保卫母国的殖民地, 和保护本国的国际贸易.

|They also maintained large navies to protect international trade and defend foreign colonies.

The ships that transported raw materials and finished products required ports where they could refuel and resupply, as did the navies that kept them safe.


As more of the industrialized nations embarked on empire building, and as reaching international markets became an expected part of their strategy, the value of having strong navies to protect commercial trade only grew. Maintaining supply and fueling stations around the world to service these navies and fleets of merchant ships became a key argument in favor of developing more colonies.

=== 对"重商主义"的批评

Mercantilism also had many critics. Many Europeans argued that the assumptions underlying mercantilist theory were flawed, and that putting it into practice was often harmful.

|-> 一国金银越多, ①会导致物价上涨, ②通胀, 即物以稀为贵, 金银越多, 金银本身的价格就越低.

|Eighteenth-century Scottish philosopher David Hume argued that as more gold circulated in a country’s economy, prices would rise, eventually becoming so high that no one would purchase goods. If abundance reduced the value of an item, then the more gold and silver a nation acquired, the less valuable it would be.




|-> 世界各国的经济贸易, 并非零和博弈

|The eighteenth-century philosopher and economist Adam Smith, also a Scot, criticized mercantilism as well. Smith argued that economic gain for one nation did not mean economic loss for others. Rather, trade could be mutually beneficial for all. It made little sense for a nation to produce everything it needed.


|-> 政府放松监管, 有利于经济发展

|Smith also opposed government regulation of the economy. In his view, competition among the producers of goods and the influence of the market (that is, the desires of buyers and sellers) made for a healthy economy.

==  "风险投资"体系的建立 : commenda 系统

The commercial empire that funded European overseas exploration began in the Italian city-states of the Middle Ages, but the investment system on which it was based did not originate there. This system, called commenda, established a sort of financial patronage by which investors funded merchants to expand their trading enterprises and earned a more extensive business network in the process.

By the late fifteenth century, Italian city-states were supporting a variety of small family-owned businesses and large companies. Capital was concentrated in land and commerce rather than in industrial pursuits, but credit was widely used. Across Europe, risk-sharing business ventures and joint investment schemes were already commonplace among merchants.

==  探索新航路 (16世纪)  (为了跳过中间商, 获取原材料产地)

=== 探索新航路的动机 → 为了跳过中间商, 获取原材料产地

With the collapse of Constantinople and the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottomans in 1453, Muslims now controlled their tenuous overland connections to South and East Asia. As a result, they now had to go through Muslim intermediaries to purchase valuable spices such as cinnamon, pepper, cloves, and nutmeg that grew in only a few key locations. 

European nations, therefore, wanted to find an all-water passage to India and the chain of sparsely populated Indonesian islands known as the Spice Islands.


The sixteenth century was a time of exploration and the beginning of global ocean trade.

|In the first millennium CE, Arab sailors in the Middle East had created the lateen sail, a triangular sail that allowed ships to travel against the wind. The square European sail gave ships power, but the lateen sail increased their ability to maneuver. When Europeans combined the two kinds of sail on three-masted ships, they could navigate confidently in any direction.


The sternpost rudder, created in China in the thirteenth century, also allowed for steering against the currents.


|-> 解决了: 方位指引 (古希腊星盘, 和 中国指南针)

|The adoption of these inventions allowed Europeans to abandon their long-standing practice of navigating by sailing along a coastline. Now they could venture into the open ocean, beyond sight of land.

|Especially in the Chesapeake Bay colonies of Virginia and Maryland, where tobacco constituted the main cash crop, tobacco cultivation quickly drained the soil of nutrients, leading English settlers to push further westward in search of land for new fields.

|When investors founded the British East India Company in 1600, they initially focused on trading in spices. As spices decreased in price and profit, however, the Company turned its attention to textiles produced by highly skilled Indian artisans. Finally, when the value of hand-woven fabric began decreasing in the early nineteenth century, the company pivoted to trading Indian-produced opium for Chinesegrown tea.

==  契约仆人 (殖民地移民的生存方式之一)

The colonies attracted many landless, unemployed young European men and women, too, who traveled to North America as indentured servants, bound by a contract to work for an agreed-upon number of years. After the landowner who paid for their passage had been compensated by their years of labor, indentured servants received their freedom and typically a grant of land as well.


Like their rivals the Spanish, English colonists struggled to produce agricultural goods using only their own labor. Instead, they relied heavily on indentured servants, European immigrants who typically agreed to work four to seven years in exchange for transportation to the colony and the hope of a new life there after completing their service.


In the United States, indentured servitude had been common during the colonial period, and it was the means by which many Europeans obtained passage to North America. The practice had largely died out in the United States by the middle of the nineteenth century but still existed in a few places. 


'''

==  奴隶制 (殖民地经济发展模式之一)

Coffee and sugar cane, introduced to the Americas by Europeans, grew exceedingly well in the tropical climates of the Caribbean, Central America, South America, and the southernmost portions of North America. This need for labor eventually led to the plantation-style slavery that took hold in parts of the United States, islands in the Caribbean, and areas of South America such as Brazil.


European colonists in Virginia, like those in Mexico, South America, and the Caribbean, sought ways to maintain a permanent labor force, especially when it proved difficult to recruit sufficient indentured servants from Europe. Attempts to coerce the labor of fellow Europeans would have met with too much resistance.  +

Faced with a growing underclass of embittered poor White former servants, who in 1676 sought to overthrow the colony’s government, Virginia’s elite sought to solve their problems by drawing legal distinctions between people of European and African ancestry. Racism became the basis on which the colonial labor system was built.


By the end of the nineteenth century, chattel slavery, in which one human being is owned by another and can be bought or sold, lingered in only a few places on the globe. Some nations had already abolished slavery before the Second Industrial Revolution began. 

Japan officially did so in the sixteenth century. 

Britain abolished the slave trade and ended slavery completely in 1834. 

France banned slavery in 1848, freeing nearly all enslaved people in the Caribbean. 

In India, the Penal Code of 1861 punished those who attempted to enslave others. 

The Netherlands and the United States were among the last industrialized nations to end the practice, with the Dutch freeing enslaved people in the South American colony of Suriname in 1863 and the United States abolishing slavery with the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to its Constitution in 1865.

Slavery continued in other parts of the Western Hemisphere, with Brazil not abolishing it until 1888.

Most Latin American nations ended slavery following their wars of independence in the early nineteenth century. Brazil, however, with its primarily agricultural economy, long resisted reformers’ calls for emancipation. In 1850, the country finally bowed to pressure from its chief trading partner, Great Britain, which had assumed the moral duty of abolishing slavery around the world soon after it liberated its own enslaved people.

==  资本主义 (From Mercantilism to Capitalism 经济学思想, 从”重商主义”进步到”资本主义”)

Mercantilism, which advocated building a nation’s power by increasing trade through exports, had originally propelled colonization. But as people around the world gained their political freedom, they also became interested in economic freedom, and mercantilism fell out of favor.

Capitalism, a system in which prices and costs, not government intervention, serve to regulate the supply and demand of goods traded for individual profit, became popular.


Adam Smith was a Scottish political economist and philosopher best known for writing the book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776), often referred to by its shortened title The Wealth of Nations. Earlier scholars had written about various aspects of economics, but with this book Smith became the first person to produce a comprehensive philosophical examination of the way nations should manage their economies.


'''

==  第一次工业革命 (约1760年代- 1830/1840年代)


=== 农业革命 (17世纪中期)

Beginning in the mid-1600s, the British enjoyed an agricultural revolution that allowed smaller numbers of farmers employing fewer farm laborers to produce a surplus of food, and that in turn led to a population increase.


'''

===  小屋(农舍)劳动 (18世纪) → 农民在自己的家里给企业主打工

In the 1700s, entrepreneurs in England found a way to make use of unemployed or underemployed farm laborers and their families. These entrepreneurs provided farm families with raw materials and asked them to produce finished goods in their cottages, a system that became known as cottage labor. Rural women spun wool or flax into thread, and men then wove it into woolen cloth or linen. Some farm families made bonnets from straw. Other people made nails, knit hosiery, or made lace. The entrepreneur collected their finished products, paid them for their labor, and sold the finished goods in towns and cities.
Because the farm laborers were not skilled artisans, they could not command high wages, and the entrepreneurs reaped great profits.


'''

===  企业主在城市建立工厂 → 小屋劳动模式渐废

In time, entrepreneurs began to gather laborers together in one location, a factory. This decision gave them greater control over production because they could hire managers to supervise the workers’ labor. It was also easier to install machines in factories than in laborers’ cottages. Factories came to be concentrated in towns and cities. As work moved to urban areas, so too did men and women who could not find work on farms. By the late 1700s, British business owners, supported by government policies inspired by Adam Smith, were setting up factories and hiring many of these migrant workers.


'''

===  机械化 (18世纪末) → 为工业革命打下技术基础

In the late 1700s, western European nations began to adopt mechanization, the use of machines to replace the labor of animals and humans. Mechanization set the stage for the Industrial Revolution, a transition away from societies focused on agriculture and handicraft production to socioeconomic systems dominated by the manufacture of goods, primarily with machines.


'''

=== 工业革命 (约1760年代- 1830/1840年代)

During the Industrial Revolution, factories increasingly relied on machine power, most importantly the steam engine. A steam engine uses heat to transform water into steam, which expands and drives a piston to perform work.


Great Britain was the first nation to enter the Industrial Revolution, beginning to mechanize the production of goods in the eighteenth century. It was followed by the United States, France, Belgium, and, in the first half of the nineteenth century, by Germany.

These nations harnessed the power first of water and then of steam and began the mass production of goods such as textiles, iron, and steel. Perhaps most significantly, they also manufactured machines that produced parts for other machines.


Russia lacked many advantages for industrializing that other countries possessed. It did not have many artisans. Russia’s population also consisted of many serfs who, unlike American and British farmers, were bound to the land and could not seek opportunities elsewhere such as in factories.  In 1861, it abolished serfdom, providing potential workers for factories.

|埃及, 拉美 → 觉得自己只要卖卖原材料就好了

|As the United States and European nations industrialized, African, Latin American, and Asian nations, with the exception of Japan, did not. Historians disagree about the reasons for this Great Divergence.

Countries such as Egypt and the Latin American nations realized their strengths lay better in producing raw materials for the industrializing nations than pursuing widespread industrialization. In each nation, a unique set of circumstances influenced the path taken.


|印度 → 被母国英国压制其工业化


|India’s industrial endeavors were greatly affected by its relationship with Britain, which had begun trading in India in the 1600s. Britain, however, had no intention of allowing its colony to become its economic rival. Like all colonies, India was meant to enrich Britain, not compete with it. Thus began a process often referred to as deindustrialization, a reduction in a nation’s or region’s industrial activity.


|中国 → 在东亚一家独大, 周边缺乏竞争, 成为了温室里的懒汉

|China also did not become an industrial power in the nineteenth century. Historians have offered a variety of reasons.

First, no challengers in East Asia could match China in size, wealth, and military strength, so it had no need to compete with anyone.

Second, because China’s population was large and often poor, labor was abundant and employers did not have to offer high wages to attract employees or replace workers with labor-saving machinery.

|===

'''

== 第二次工业革命 (1870-1945)

The Second Industrial Revolution began in the second half of the nineteenth century and lasted until the start of World War I.


Between the middle of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, these nations embarked on a new phase of industrialization. European and U.S. industry was transformed again by new sources of power, technological innovations, new forms of transportation, and growing communications networks. This process is often called the Second Industrial Revolution. 

At the same time, industrialization began outside the United States and western and central Europe, especially in Russia and Japan.



'''

==  农奴制

Serfdom also largely disappeared in the second half of the nineteenth century. Serfs were unfree peasants who were legally bound to work the land on which they lived, land that was owned by another. Russia held nearly all Europe’s remaining serfs. Approximately eleven million were owned by private citizens, and another twelve to thirteen million were owned by the state. Tsar Alexander II abolished serfdom in Russia in 1861. In some parts of the Russian empire, serfdom lingered on for a few more decades.


'''

==  Penal Labor (犯罪者的惩罚性)劳役

Forced labor assigned as punishment to those convicted of crimes, known as penal labor, was also employed in the second half of the nineteenth century. From 1788 to 1868, British convicts, most of whom had been found guilty of nonviolent crimes, were given the choice of languishing in a cell or being transported to the colony of Australia. If they chose Australia, after an ocean journey that might last eight months, they had to endure seven to ten years of labor. The unlucky might be assigned to work gangs, building roads or constructing government buildings. Others went to work for farmers or merchants. After they had served their sentences, they were free to remain in Australia as settlers or return to England.



Many other countries, such as the United States, also used convicts for labor or rented them for use by private citizens. People found guilty of and imprisoned for actual crimes were also often required to perform free labor, either inside or outside the prison. Prisoners were often used to build roads in the southern United States.
