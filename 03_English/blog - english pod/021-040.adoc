"Get a jump start" 意思是 “抢先开始” 或 “占得先机”。
在这个语境中，话者希望借此机会提前进入市场投资，从而在别人还在观望或害怕的时候获得领先优势。

"Nest egg" 是一个常见的习语，指的是 “储备金” 或 “存款”，通常用于形容为未来（如退休）存下来的资金。
在这里，话者将其视为一种长期投资，意图通过这笔钱为自己的未来积累财富。

话者想借三万美元进入市场，在其他人担忧经济衰退时抓住机会，尽早开始为自己的储备金打基础并谋取未来的财务安全。

我不知道。鉴于目前市场的不确定性，投资将是一个非常不明智的决定。我不知道你知不知道，孩子，最近市场出现了很多动荡。在过去的几个月里，已经有50万人失业，我们不知道拟议的刺激方案将如何影响经济。不稳定因素太多了。我觉得在这种环境下投资是不舒服的。

A: But look at it this way, every challenge is
an opportunity. And anyway, I’m not talking
about investing in the domestic market.
There are emerging markets that promise (v.)
great returns. Look at China, for example;

whom have recently entered the middle
class. Here alone, _the aggregate (a.)总计的，合计的 demand_ for
_consumer goods_ 消费品 rePresents (v.) an amazing
_wealth generating_ 创造财富 opportunity.

[.my2]
但换个角度看，每一个挑战都是一个机会。不管怎样，我说的不是投资国内市场。
有些新兴市场有望带来巨大回报。以中国为例；中国有14亿人口，其中5亿人刚刚进入中产阶级。仅在这里，对消费品的总需求就代表着一个惊人的创造财富的机会。

B: Come on, son, you’re looking at this too
naively 无邪地；天真烂漫地, the Chinese market has exhibited 展出；表现出 a
great deal of 许多,大量的,很多 instability, and their currency 通货，货币

be it. But you’re *losing out 得不到（需要或觉得应有的东西） on* a great
opportunity here. I’m going to go *hit up* 向（某人）要求（钱等） Mum

[.my3]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|Debit card (相当于支付宝) |Credit card (相当于小额贷款)

|扣賬卡（Debit card）即是直接與銀行戶口綁定的銀行卡，持有人可用作消費簽賬或提款，交易金額會直接從戶口結餘扣除。換言之，*持有人不可以「先使未來錢」，在消費之前必須確保銀行戶口裡有足夠結餘支付，方可順利憑卡進行交易。*
|使用信用卡（Credit card）

.Overdraft Protection
透支保护：一种银行服务，用于防止账户透支。当账户余额不足时，银行会自动从其他账户或信用额度中转移资金，以避免透支费用或拒付。

Overdraft protection is an optional service that *prevents* charges 费用 to a bank account (primarily checks, ATM transactions （一笔）交易，业务，买卖;办理；处理, debit-card charges) *from* being rejected 拒绝，驳回；不同意 when they exceed 超过，超出；超越（限制） the available funds 可用资金 in the account. Overdraft protection, sometimes called cash-reserve 现金储备 checking, is used most frequently as a cushion 垫子，缓冲垫 for _checking accounts_ 支票账户, but it also can be applied to _savings accounts_.


透支保护是一项可选服务，可防止向银行帐户收取的费用（主要是支票、ATM 交易、借记卡费用）在超过帐户中的可用资金时被拒绝。透支保护，有时称为现金储备检查，最常用作支票账户的缓冲，但也可应用于储蓄账户。

With overdraft protection, even if the account has insufficient 不充分的，不够重要的 funds, the bank will cover the shortfall 缺口；差额；亏空 so that the transaction  交易，买卖，业务 goes through. When a customer *signs up 报名（参加课程） for* overdraft protection, they designate (v.)命名；指定;选定，指派，委任（某人任某职） a backup account 备份帐户 for the bank to use (v.) as the source to cover any overdrafts —usually a linked savings account, credit card, or line of credit 信用额度.

However, the bank charges (v.) the customer for this service in a few ways, for example, through _overdraft fees_ 透支费用 to process (v.) any transactions that overdraw (v.)透支 the account.

有了透支保护，即使账户资金不足，银行也会补足不足的部分，以便交易顺利进行。当客户注册透支保护时，他们会指定一个备用账户供银行用​​作支付任何透支的来源——通常是链接的储蓄账户、信用卡或信用额度。然而，银行通过多种方式向客户收取此项服务的费用，例如通过"透支费"来处理任何透支账户的交易。

Without overdraft protection, `主` transactions that have insufficient funds to cover them `谓` are returned unpaid—that is, _checks_ bounce (v.)拒付，退回（支票等） and _debit transactions_ are refused, which can be expensive and disruptive (a.)引起混乱的；扰乱性的；破坏性的 for the customer. Many banks charge (v.) overdraft and non-sufficient funds (NSF) fees (traditionally between $30 and $35, per transaction, on average, although several larger banks began reducing or eliminating 消除 the NSF fee *as of* 从…开始，截至… late 2022) for accounts that don't have sufficient funds.


如果没有透支保护，资金不足以支付的交易将被退回未付款，也就是说，支票被退回并且借记交易被拒绝，这对客户来说可能是昂贵的且具有破坏性。许多银行对资金不足的账户收取透支和资金不足 (NSF)费用（传统上每笔交易平均在 30 至 35 美元之间，尽管几家较大的银行从 2022 年底开始减少或取消 NSF 费用）资金。

If you bounce a check, you can incur (v.)带来（成本、花费等）；招致，遭受 a variety of 各种各样的 charges or, in extreme cases, your bank can close your account, which also affects your ability to open a new checking account.

如果您退回支票，您可能会产生各种费用，或者在极端情况下，您的银行可能会关闭您的账户，这也会影响您开设新支票账户的能力。






What's more, *not only* can the bank refuse (v.) payment and charge (v.) the account holder, *but* a penalty （因违反法律、规定或合同而受到的）处罚，刑罚 or fee may also be charged by the merchant 商人 for the failed transaction.

更重要的是，银行不仅可以拒绝付款并向账户持有人收取费用，商户还可能对失败的交易收取罚款或费用。

As soon as the overdraft protection service is triggered, the linked account is charged a _transfer fee_ 过户手续费 to move funds to cover (v.) the shortfall. The account holder may also be charged *either* an additional fee every month that overdraft protection is used *or* a fixed _monthly fee_ for continuous protection.

一旦透支保护服务被触发，关联账户就会被收取转账费，以转移资金以弥补缺口。账户持有人还可能因使用透支保护而每月被收取额外费用，或因持续保护而每月被收取固定费用。
