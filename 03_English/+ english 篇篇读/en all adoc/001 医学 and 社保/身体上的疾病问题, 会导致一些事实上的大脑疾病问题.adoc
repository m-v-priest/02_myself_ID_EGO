越来越多的证据表明，在某些情况下，一系列感染, 可能引发强迫症、抽动、焦虑、抑郁, 甚至精神病等病症。感染只是这个难题的一小部分。越来越清楚的是，"炎症性疾病"和"代谢状况", 也会对心理健康产生相当大的影响，尽管精神科医生很少寻找它们。所有这些都是精神病学中重大问题的症状。

.tic，tics
是一种突发、重复的不随意运动（motor movement）或发声（vocalization），其无节律性且涉及某范围独立的肌肉群。 抽动通常快速且短暂，且可能类似于正常的行为特征或手势。 +

医学术语“抽动”大多**分为"运动性抽动"和"发声性抽动"。** +

然而，有时二者不易分清，甚至有"感觉性抽动"（sensory tics），即在前二者发作之前, 有身体局部不适感，或被认为是先兆症状（前驱症状）。

.inflammatory disorders
炎症性疾病：一类由于机体免疫系统异常反应, 或感染等原因, 引起的疾病，通常表现为组织或器官的炎症反应。

[.my2]
修改后的理解, 可能会对目前治疗不佳的数百万患有精神健康问题的人, 产生深远的影响。例如，超过90%的"双相情感障碍"患者, 在其一生中, 会出现病情反复发作的情况；在患有"强迫症" (OCD) 的儿童中，超过 46% 的儿童未获得缓解。大约 50-60% 的抑郁症患者, 在尝试多种不同的药物后, 最终得到缓解。

The field of psychiatry /has historically been #focused around# the description and classification 分类；归类；分级 of symptoms, rather than #on# underlying causes.

At the same time, depression and anxiety come in many different subtypes 子类型 — panic disorder 恐慌症 with and without agoraphobia 公共场所恐惧, for example, are distinct 截然不同的；有区别的；不同种类的 diagnoses 诊断；（问题原因的）判断 — not all of which may be meaningfully distinct.

This can lead to _patient groups in drug trials_ being #so# diverse (a.)不同的；相异的；多种多样的；形形色色的 #that# drugs and therapies fail (v.) /simply because `主` the cohort being studied `谓` has too little in common.

[.my2]
精神病学领域, 历来关注症状的描述和分类，而不是根本原因。精神疾病诊断和统计手册 (DSM)，有时被称为精神病学圣经，于 1952 年问世，包含描述、症状, 和诊断标准。一方面，它为诊断带来了有益的一致性。但另一方面，它将患者分组，却对其病情背后的潜在机制没有任何了解。例如，"抑郁症"和"焦虑症"的症状, 有很多重叠之处，以至于有些人怀疑它们实际上是否是不同的疾病类别。与此同时，抑郁症和焦虑症, 有许多不同的亚型——例如，"伴有"或"不伴有"广场恐惧症的恐慌症, 是不同的诊断——并非所有亚型, 都具有有意义的区别。这可能导致药物试验中的患者群体如此多样化，以至于药物和疗法, 仅仅因为所研究的群体没有太多共同点而失败。

== (pure) Many mental-health conditions have bodily triggers




Evidence is accumulating that an array of infections can, in some cases, trigger conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, tics, anxiety, depression and even psychosis. And infections are one small piece of the puzzle. It is increasingly clear that inflammatory disorders and metabolic conditions can also have sizeable effects on mental health, though psychiatrists rarely look for them. All this is symptomatic of large problems in psychiatry.



A revised understanding could have profound consequences for the millions of people with mental-health conditions that are currently poorly treated. For example, over 90% of patients with bipolar disorder will have recurrent illness during their lives; and in children with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) over 46% do not achieve remission. Some 50-60% of patients with depression eventually respond after trying many different drugs.



The field of psychiatry has historically been focused around the description and classification of symptoms, rather than on underlying causes. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), sometimes known as the bible of psychiatry, emerged in 1952 and contains descriptions, symptoms and diagnostic criteria. On the one hand, it has brought helpful consistency to diagnosis. But on the other, it has grouped patients into cohorts without any sense of the underlying mechanisms behind their conditions. There is so much overlap between the symptoms of depression and anxiety, for example, that some wonder if these are actually even separate categories of illness. At the same time, depression and anxiety come in many different subtypes—panic disorder with and without agoraphobia, for example, are distinct diagnoses—not all of which may be meaningfully distinct. This can lead to patient groups in drug trials being so diverse that drugs and therapies fail simply because the cohort being studied has too little in common.



Previous attempts to find causal mechanisms for mental-health conditions have run into difficulty. In 2013 the National Institute of Mental Health, an American government agency, made a heroic gamble to move away from research based on the DSM’s symptom-based categories. Money was funnelled into basic research on disease processes of the brain, hoping to directly connect genes to behaviours. Some $20bn of new research was funded but the idea failed spectacularly—most of the genes uncovered had tiny effects.

A key moment came in 2007, when work at the University of Pennsylvania showed that 100 patients with rapidly progressing psychiatric symptoms or cognitive impairments actually had an autoimmune disease. Their bodies were creating antibodies against key receptors in nerve cells known as NMDA receptors. These lead to brain swelling and can trigger a range of symptoms including paranoia, hallucinations and aggression. The disease was dubbed “anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis”. Most important of all, in many cases it was treatable by removing the antibodies, or using immunotherapy drugs or steroids. Studies of patients having a first episode of psychosis have found that between 5% and 10% also have brain-attacking antibodies.



It seems likely that, in rare cases, OCD can be caused by the immune system, too.  One 64-year-old man reported spending an extraordinary amount of time obsessively trimming his lawn only to look back on this behaviour the next day with feelings of regret and guilt. Researchers found these symptoms were being caused by antibodies attacking the neurons in his brain.



More recently, Belinda Lennox, head of psychiatry at the University of Oxford, has conducted tests on thousands of patients with psychosis. She has found increased rates of antibodies in the blood samples of about 6% of patients, mostly targeting the NMDA receptors. She says it remains unknown how a single set of antibodies is capable of producing clinical presentations ranging from seizures to psychosis and encephalitis. Nor is it known why these antibodies are made, or if they can cross the blood-brain barrier, a membrane that controls access to the brain. She assumes, though, that they do—preferentially sticking to the hippocampus, which would explain how they affect memory and lead to delusions and hallucinations.



Dr Lennox says a shift in medical thinking is needed to appreciate the damage the immune system can do to the brain. The “million dollar question”, she says, is whether these conditions are treatable.  Work on patients with immune-driven psychosis suggests that a range of strategies including removing antibodies and taking immunotherapy drugs or steroids can be effective treatments.


Another important discovery is that metabolic disturbances can also affect mental health. The brain is an energy-hungry organ, and metabolic alterations related to energy pathways have been implicated in a diverse range of conditions, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, psychosis, eating disorders and major depressive disorder.




...One active area of research at the clinic is the potential benefits of the ketogenic diet, in which carbohydrate intake is limited. This diet forces the body to burn fat for energy, thereby creating chemicals known as ketones which can act as a fuel source for the brain when glucose is in limited supply.


13 trials are under way worldwide looking at the effects of metabolic therapies on serious mental illness. Preliminary results have shown a “large group of people responding in an incredibly meaningful way. These are people that have failed drugs, talk therapy, trans-cranial stimulation and maybe electroconvulsive-shock therapy.” He says that he keeps meeting psychiatrists who have come to the metabolic field because of patients whose low-carb diets were followed by huge improvements in mood. Results from randomised controlled trials are expected in the next year or so.


It is not only understanding of the immune and metabolic systems that is improving. Vast quantities of data are now being parsed with unprecedented speed, sometimes with the help of artificial intelligence (AI), to uncover connections previously hidden in plain sight.


This could at long last bring biology more centrally into the diagnosis of mental health, potentially leading to more individualised treatments, as well as better ones. In early October 2023, UK Biobank, a biomedical database, published data revealing that people with depressive episodes had significantly higher levels of inflammatory proteins, such as cytokines, in the blood. A study last year also found about a quarter of depressed patients had evidence of low-grade inflammation. This could be useful to know as other work suggests patients with inflammation respond poorly to antidepressants.


All such developments are promising. But many of the field’s problems could be resolved by relaxing the distinctions that exist today between neurology, which studies and treats physical, structural and functional disorders of the brain, and psychiatry, which deals with mental, emotional and behavioural disorders. Dr Lennox finds it extraordinary that the treatment options differ so completely if a patient ends up on a neurology ward or a psychiatric ward. She wants antibody testing to be more routine in Britain when someone presents with a sudden post-viral mental illness that does not get better with standard treatments.

Those with ME/CFS, a post-infectious condition which comes with a series of cognitive problems such as attention and concentration deficits, were once dismissed as malingering or diagnosed with “yuppie flu”. New work suggests it is associated with both immune and metabolic dysfunction.
