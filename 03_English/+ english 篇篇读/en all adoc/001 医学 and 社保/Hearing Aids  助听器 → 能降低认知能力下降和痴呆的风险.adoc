最近的研究表明，#即使老年人轻度或中度听力损失, 也与认知能力加速下降有关。#
##听力损失的人更有可能患上"痴呆症"，##而且这种可能性, 随着听力损失的严重程度而增加。
2020 年，《柳叶刀》痴呆症委员会, 将听力损失, 确定为主要可改变其影响的"中年风险因素", 该风险因素会影响该疾病(老年痴呆)的后期发展。 +

When hearing loss is untreated, the brain's organization changes. In adults with mild hearing loss, studies show a decrease in gray matter.

Hearing loss is also associated with more falls, higher health-care costs, and increased loneliness and social isolation. Hearing is fundamental to healthy aging.
