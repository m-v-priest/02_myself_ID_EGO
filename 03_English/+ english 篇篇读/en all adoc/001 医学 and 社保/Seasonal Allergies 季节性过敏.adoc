Flowers and trees are in bloom —and so are _pollen 花粉 allergies_ 过敏；敏感.
The sneezes, _runny 流鼻涕的；流眼泪的;太稀的；水分过多的 noses_ and _itchy 发痒的 eyes_ that typically come with seasonal allergies /are both miserable and extremely common.  About _one in four_ U.S. adults /`谓` reported having _seasonal allergies_ in 2021, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And symptoms are getting worse and lasting (v.) longer: climate change is lengthening (v.)（使）延长 the growing season （植物的）生长季节 /and *exposing* (v.) plants *to* higher _carbon dioxide_ levels, causing them to produce more pollen.


[.my2]
花草树木盛开，花粉过敏也是如此。季节性过敏通常会导致打喷嚏、流鼻涕, 和眼睛发痒. 根据美国疾病控制与预防中心的数据，2021 年约有四分之一的美国成年人报告患有季节性过敏。而且症状变得越来越严重，持续时间也越来越长：气候变化正在延长生长季节，使植物暴露在更高的二氧化碳水平下，导致它们产生更多的花粉。


A human immune system has two parts: One mounts (v.)准备；安排；组织开展 a general reaction 全身反应 to any foreign substance. Meanwhile the other *responds to* specific substances /that the body has encountered before. The immune system will remember and develop (v.) dedicated resources 专用资源 to fight off 击退 those previous threats /if the body *runs into* 遭遇，撞上，碰上 them again /in the future. Allergies are such a target-specific 目标明确的 immune response, and any substance that causes this kind of reaction /is dubbed (v.)把…戏称为；给…起绰号 an allergen 过敏原，变应原（能引起变态反应或过敏的物质）. “We can become allergic (a.)（对…）变态反应的，变应的，过敏的 to any protein, really,”

[.my2]
人体免疫系统由两部分组成：第一部分, 对"任何异物"产生一般反应。与此同时，另一种, 对"身体以前遇到过的特定物质"做出反应。如果身体将来再次遇到这些威胁，免疫系统将记住, 并开发专用资源来抵御以前的威胁。*过敏是一种针对特定目标的免疫反应，任何引起这种反应的物质都被称为"过敏原"。 “实际上，我们可能对任何蛋白质过敏."*

How an allergy develops (v.) in the first place /is still a bit of a mystery 神秘的事物,谜 —but researchers have some solid 可靠的；可信赖的；坚实的 theories. Scientists know (v.)  babies aren’t born with specific allergies 敏感症,  and they can come and go 来来去去 throughout 自始至终；贯穿整个时期 someone’s life. Evidence also suggests /genetics plays a role: children of parents with allergies /are more likely to have them, too.

[.my2]
过敏最初是如何形成的, 仍然是一个谜，但研究人员有一些可靠的理论。科学家们知道, 婴儿并不是天生就有特定的过敏症，而且这些过敏症可能会在人的一生中出现或消失。有证据还表明，遗传因素也发挥了一定作用：父母患有过敏症的孩子, 也更有可能患有过敏症。


Allergy formation 组成；形成 is also determined (v.)决定；形成；支配；影响 by how reactive the immune system happens to be /during the first exposure to a substance. If the system is particularly reactive, it’s likely to deem (v.)认为；视为；相信 the substance a threat /*to watch out for* 戒备；小心提防 in the future. Different exposure routes 暴露途径 can also affect (v.) the likelihood of developing allergies. For example, a person’s immune system is more accustomed to seeing new substances *pass (v.) through* the gut, so it is less likely *to respond to* such substances #than# it might be to compounds (n.)混合物，化合物 后定 first encountered (v.) through the skin —which rarely *lets (v.) in* _outside material_.

[.my2]
**过敏的形成, 还取决于免疫系统在第一次接触某种物质时的反应程度。如果系统特别反应，它可能会认为该物质是未来需要警惕的威胁。** +
*不同的接触途径, 也会影响发生过敏的可能性。例如，一个人的免疫系统更习惯于看到新物质通过肠道，因此它对这些物质的反应可能性, 低于对首先通过皮肤遇到的化合物的反应——皮肤很少让外界物质进入。*

But why is the immune system so markedly 显著地，明显地 sensitive to pollen?
Pollen is difficult *to acclimate (v.)（使）习惯（新地方、新情况、新气候）；（使）服水土 to* /because it’s seasonal (a.)季节性的；随季节变化的 *rather than* consistently present (v.) in the environment. In addition 此外，另外, _the tiny 极小的；微小的；微量的, airborne 空气传播的 pollen grains_ 颗粒；细粒 that cause (v.) allergies /can easily make their way past the nose /and deeper into _the respiratory tract_ 呼吸道. In general, however, allergies develop (v.) /because the immune system is reactive when it first meets (v.) an allergen; the conditions don’t arise (v.)发生；产生；出现 from any specific characteristic 特性 of the pollen itself.

[.my2]
但为什么免疫系统对花粉如此明显敏感呢？花粉很难适应，因为它是季节性的，而不是持续存在于环境中。此外，引起过敏的空气传播的微小花粉粒很容易穿过鼻子，深入呼吸道。然而，一般来说，过敏的发生是因为免疫系统在第一次遇到过敏原时会做出反应。这些情况并不是由花粉本身的任何特定特征引起的。

首先，尽可能减少接触"已知过敏原"。这可以包括监测当地的花粉水平，以确定何时外出，并关闭窗户以保持房屋无花粉。当您确实出现症状时，"抗组胺药"和其他非处方药, 可以帮助控制瘙痒、打喷嚏和流泪。


If these approaches aren’t sufficient, consider (v.) talking to an allergist 过敏症专科医师 about immunotherapy 免疫疗法, which most commonly means _allergy shots_ 过敏疫苗注射.

== (pure) Why Seasonal Allergies Are So Miserable




Flowers and trees are in bloom—and so are pollen allergies.
The sneezes, runny noses and itchy eyes that typically come with seasonal allergies are both miserable and extremely common.  About one in four U.S. adults reported having seasonal allergies in 2021, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And symptoms are getting worse and lasting longer: climate change is lengthening the growing season and exposing plants to higher carbon dioxide levels, causing them to produce more pollen.




A human immune system has two parts: One mounts a general reaction to any foreign substance. Meanwhile the other responds to specific substances that the body has encountered before. The immune system will remember and develop dedicated resources to fight off those previous threats if the body runs into them again in the future. Allergies are such a target-specific immune response, and any substance that causes this kind of reaction is dubbed an allergen. “We can become allergic to any protein, really,”



How an allergy develops in the first place is still a bit of a mystery—but researchers have some solid theories. Scientists know babies aren’t born with specific allergies, and they can come and go throughout someone’s life. Evidence also suggests genetics plays a role: children of parents with allergies are more likely to have them, too.


Allergy formation is also determined by how reactive the immune system happens to be during the first exposure to a substance. If the system is particularly reactive, it’s likely to deem the substance a threat to watch out for in the future. Different exposure routes can also affect the likelihood of developing allergies. For example, a person’s immune system is more accustomed to seeing new substances pass through the gut, so it is less likely to respond to such substances than it might be to compounds first encountered through the skin—which rarely lets in outside material.


But why is the immune system so markedly sensitive to pollen?
Pollen is difficult to acclimate to because it’s seasonal rather than consistently present in the environment. In addition, the tiny, airborne pollen grains that cause allergies can easily make their way past the nose and deeper into the respiratory tract. In general, however, allergies develop because the immune system is reactive when it first meets an allergen; the conditions don’t arise from any specific characteristic of the pollen itself.

Environmental allergies are mediated by a protein called immunoglobulin E, or IgE. Such an allergy’s initial development triggers the production of IgE molecules that are able to bind to the specific allergen. When the immune system detects the allergen again, it churns out IgE proteins, which bind to the surface of the body’s protective mast cells as scouts. When a scout IgE binds to the allergen, the mast cell releases a cocktail of chemicals—including histamines and other inflammatory substances that trigger the congestion, watery eyes and sneezing that we associate with allergies. An allergic response tends to remain strongest in the body part where the allergen was mainly encountered—so inhaling pollen might make your nose run, whereas getting it in your eyes might make them water.


While it might be tempting to hate on IgE and mast cells, this branch of the immune system has a long history of protecting people from parasitic infections. Modern humans don’t encounter these threats as often, so it’s easy to paint allergies as an overreaction.



Allergies are your body’s immune system thinking that it’s doing the right thing. The immune system is always trying to differentiate between self and not self. That’s what has kept us alive.




She, Weis and Jerath offer a three-pronged approach to living with allergies.


First, reduce exposure to known allergens when possible. This can include monitoring local pollen levels to determine when to spend time outside and leaving your windows closed to keep your house pollen-free. When you do have symptoms, antihistamines and other over-the-counter medicines can help manage itching, sneezing and watery eyes.



If these approaches aren’t sufficient, consider talking to an allergist about immunotherapy, which most commonly means allergy shots. These shots contain a personalized mixture of your allergens at low doses and act to desensitize your immune system, teaching it to tolerate these materials rather than unleash mast cells in their presence. In the U.S., immunotherapy is also available in tablet form for grass and ragweed pollens, as well as dust mites.

It does take time to see results: treatment with allergy shots can take about six months to improve symptoms and five years to complete, Jerath says. Still, she says, this approach is an impressive way to actually diminish allergies instead of just treating their symptoms. “It’s a little bit mind-blowing,” she adds, “to think about the fact that you can actually retrain the immune system.”
