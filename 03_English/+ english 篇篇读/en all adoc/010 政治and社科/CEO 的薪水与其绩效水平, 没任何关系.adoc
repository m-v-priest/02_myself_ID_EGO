“在美国，高管的薪酬往往与其业绩极不相符……形势不利于投资者。”2006年，传奇投资人、热血资本家沃伦•巴菲特(Warren Buffett)就是用这句话, 挑战了美国企业界对CEO薪酬的惯常看法。该惯常看法认为，老板应该得到丰厚的报酬，因为这些报酬与公司的财务表现紧密相关。但14年的证据表明，这个惯常观点看起来仍然不可靠。

批评人士指出，除了存在"奖励运气,而不是技能"的问题之外，还有其他问题。其中一个就是老板的寻租行为，他们能从薪酬设定的不透明上, 获得利益. 薪酬设定的过程就是个黑箱, 斯坦福大学商学院研究生院的大卫·拉克解释说。哈佛法学院的卢西恩·贝布丘克(Lucian Bebchuk)是该领域的另一位专家，他认为，美国的CEO往往实际权力高于董事会议室中的其他人, 因此对这个不透明的薪酬设定过程, 有着太大的影响力。老板们对自己薪酬的影响力, 是“比其他任何人都大”的。

使用薪酬顾问会带来的最大问题是, 他们使用的"薪酬标杆分析法"，这导致了老板们的整体薪酬不断上涨。正如CalPERS的Nzima先生观察到的那样，“每个人想要得到薪酬目标, 要么是中位数，要么是高于中位数的，所以无论他们的实际业绩表现如何，薪酬中位数总是会更高。”另一家为客户提供薪酬咨询的咨询公司美世(Mercer), 其格雷格·帕辛(Gregg Passin)承认, 棘轮效应是真实存在的。“我不能否认，”他说。他的公司建议，一些老板(CEO)，比如首次担任首席执行官的人，薪酬应该低于中位数。

== <pure> Pay guaranteed, performance optional


“TOO OFTEN, executive compensation in the US is ridiculously out of line with performance… The deck is stacked against investors.” It was with these words that in 2006 Warren Buffett, a legendary investor and red-blooded capitalist, challenged the received wisdom in corporate America about CEO pay. This maintains that bosses deserve generous rewards because these are tightly linked to their companies’ financial performance. Fourteen years’ worth of evidence later the received wisdom is still looking shaky.


In 2017 MSCI, a research firm, published its analysis of realised chief-executive pay between 2007 and 2016 at more than 400 big public American firms. At more than three-fifths of the firms, it showed no correlation with ten-year total returns (see chart 2). Some firms overpaid lousy bosses; others underpaid successful ones. Pay-for-performance “may be broken”, MSCI concluded. A recent paper co-authored by Lucas Davis of the Haas School of Business finds “strong evidence” that bosses of energy firms see clear pay gains when stock valuations rise as a result of an oil-price spike which they have no way to influence.

A fresh analysis by Equilar, commissioned by CalPERS, a big Californian public pension fund, identifies similar trends. It looked at the past five years of realised CEO pay for most firms in the Russell 3000 and compared this with the companies’ total returns. The bosses in the top pay quartile made twelve times what those in the bottom quartile did, but produced financial returns only twice as good. The bosses in the second-lowest pay quartile made nearly three times as much as those in the bottom quartile, even though their firms’ total returns were actually worse. “There is no evidence that boards can tell in advance who is a talented CEO,” sums up Simiso Nzima of CalPERS.


Critics point to problems besides rewarding luck instead of skill. One is rent-seeking by bosses, who can take advantage of the opacity that tends to surround pay-setting. The process was long a dark art, explains David Larcker of Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business. Lucian Bebchuk of Harvard Law School, another expert in the field, has argued that American CEOs, who tend to tower over their boardrooms, have too much influence over this opaque process. He concedes that bosses retain “more influence over their own pay than any other person”.


Compensation committees often rely on advice — and political cover — from pay consultants. A recent study of 2,347 firms, by Kevin Murphy of the Marshall School of Business and colleagues, finds that companies using consultants pay more. Independently, those with higher pay and more complex pay plans are also likelier to hire advisers. Most problematic is their use of pay benchmarking, which has led to the ratcheting-up of pay for all bosses. As Mr Nzima of CalPERS observes, “Everyone is targeting [underline]#either# median [underline]#or# above-median pay, so median is always going higher regardless of actual performance.” Gregg Passin of Mercer, another consultancy which advises clients on pay, accepts that the ratchet effect is real. “I can’t deny it,” he says. His firm recommends that some bosses, such as first-time CEOs, should be paid below the median.

America’s influential Council of Institutional Investors, which represents big asset managers, last year called for simplifying pay structures. CalPERS wants to replace common pay packages, such as those based on three-year performance, with plans reflecting rigorous five-year performance measures, or delay payouts from equity grants for at least five years. It is also rebelling against using median pay as the favoured benchmark.
