== Doctors Complete (v.) First Successful Face and Whole-Eye Transplan 医生完成首例成功的面部和全眼移植手术

[.my2]
本周，医生宣布他们已经成功完成了首例部分面部和整个眼睛的移植手术。  +
他的移植眼睛还没有视力，而且可能永远无法恢复视力，但早期证据表明眼睛本身是健康的，并且可能能够将神经信号传输到大脑。 
主要障碍是实现视神经的再生，视神经将视觉信号从视网膜传送到大脑；这一步骤尚未在人类身上成功证实。 +

== Doctors Complete First Successful Face and Whole-Eye Transplan

This week doctors announced they had completed the first successful transplant of a partial face and an entire eye.

He does not yet have vision in the transplanted eye and may never regain it there, but early evidence suggests the eye itself is healthy and may be capable of transmitting neurological signals to the brain.

the main obstacle is achieving regeneration of the optic nerve, which carries visual signals from the retina to the brain; this step has not yet been successfully demonstrated in humans.

Cutting-edge three-dimensional (3D) computer surgical planning, along with patient-specific 3D cutting guides, enabled precise alignment of bones and optimal placement of implantable plates and screws.

Face and cornea transplants have been performed before, yet to the NYU Langone team’s knowledge, this is the first time a whole eye has been transplanted successfully (with or without a face). The first partial face transplant was performed in 2005 in France.

The decision was made to transplant the donor’s eye as well, because even if James never regained sight, the organ would help restore his face’s appearance. Like any transplant, there was a chance his immune system would reject the eye—but he would already need to take immunosuppressant medication for the face transplant.

The portions of the face that were transplanted included the nose, left eyelids and eyebrow, lips, underlying skull, nasal and chin bones, cheekbones, and all of the muscle and nerve tissue under the right eye. The entire left eye and optic nerve were transplanted, and stem cells from the donor’s bone marrow were transplanted along with them in the hopes of helping the optic nerve regenerate.

James has since made a good recovery. He is able to talk, and although he does not have much ability to move his lips and facial muscles yet, Rodriguez says he will recover a lot of that ability with time.

As of six months post-transplantation, James does not yet report any vision in the transplanted eye.

Cross-sectional imaging of the donated eye’s macula (the central part of the retina) showed it was thinner after the transplant—but this had been expected because the blood supply had been necessarily disrupted, and a fair number of photoreceptors—light-sensitive cells in the retina—were still present, Dedania says. The photoreceptors appear to be responsive to light in preliminary tests. The medical team plans to conduct more rigorous follow-up testing soon to confirm this, however.

Scientists have been working toward whole-eye transplantation for many years.

Until these questions are addressed, “I’m doubtful that you will get a successful transplant in terms of restoring function."
