== New Studies Show Drops in World Insect Population 新研究显示世界昆虫数量下降


A new group of studies suggests Earth is losing around 1 to 2 percent of its insects each year. The losses are blamed on climate change, pollution, agriculture, land use changes and chemicals.

another issue is that many people simply hate insects. She added that this is true even though the small creatures do a lot of good. They pollinate (v.)授粉；传粉 the world’s foods, *get rid of 去除,消弭 waste* and play an important part in the food chain.

一组新的研究表明，地球每年正在失去大约 1% 到 2% 的昆虫。这些损失归咎于气候变化、污染、农业、土地利用变化和化学品。

另一个问题是许多人根本讨厌昆虫。她补充说，尽管这些小生物做了很多好事，但事实确实如此。它们为世界上的食物授粉，消除废物，并在食物链中发挥着重要作用。

Drier weather in the U.S. West, driven by climate change, means less milkweed 乳草属植物 for butterflies to eat. And changes in American agriculture remove (v.) weeds and flowers they need for  nectar 花蜜.

由于气候变化，美国西部天气变得干燥，意味着可供蝴蝶食用的马利筋减少。美国农业的变化, 消除了它们获取花蜜所需的杂草和花朵。
