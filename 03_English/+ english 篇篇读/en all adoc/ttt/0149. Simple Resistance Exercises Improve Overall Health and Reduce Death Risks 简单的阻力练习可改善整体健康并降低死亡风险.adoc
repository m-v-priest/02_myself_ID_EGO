== Simple Resistance Exercises Improve Overall Health and Reduce Death Risks 简单的阻力练习可改善整体健康并降低死亡风险


there’s growing evidence that muscle-strengthening routines confer a host of physical and cognitive advantages, some of which can’t be achieved through aerobic workouts alone.

越来越多的证据表明，"肌肉强化训练"可以带来许多身体和认知优势，其中一些优势无法仅通过"有氧运动"来实现。


we need to get in reps—as in curls, push-ups and squats. That’s why the federal Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, the World Health Organization, and others specify two or more sessions a week of muscle-strengthening activities. They mean weight-bearing exercises of moderate or greater intensity involving all major muscle groups.

**我们需要进行重复次数，例如弯举、俯卧撑和深蹲。**这就是为什么美国联邦体育活动指南、世界卫生组织和其他机构规定: 每周进行两次或两次以上的肌肉强化活动。它们意味着涉及所有主要肌肉群的中等或更大强度的负重运动。



Like aerobic exercise, resistance training increases heart rate and makes the lungs work more to keep the additional blood flow filled with oxygen. But the primary benefit of muscle-strengthening activity comes from the way it taxes the muscles. Pushing or pulling against resistance generates microscopic tears in muscle tissue. These tiny tears are not really damaging: they prompt the muscle to repair itself and build more fibers to become stronger.

与有氧运动一样，阻力训练会提高心率，并使肺部更加努力地工作，以保持额外的血流充满氧气。但肌肉强化活动的主要好处, 来自于它对肌肉的负荷方式。抵抗阻力的推或拉, 会在肌肉组织中产生微小的撕裂。*这些微小的撕裂并没有真正的破坏性：它们会促使肌肉自我修复, 并形成更多的纤维以变得更强壮。*



In 2022 an analysis of several studies found that muscle-strengthening exercises were associated with a 10 to 17 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality than in people who didn’t do such exercises. And the same year, Gorzelitz and her colleagues used data on nearly 100,000 older Americans to show that those who did both aerobic and resistance training had the lowest mortality risk in the entire group. Weightlifting, by itself, also reduced the risk of death from all causes as well as from cardiovascular disease specifically.

2022 年，对多项研究的分析发现，**与不进行肌肉强化锻炼的人相比，进行肌肉强化锻炼的人, "全因死亡率"风险降低 10% 至 17%。**同年，戈泽利茨和她的同事利用近 10 万美国老年人的数据表明，*同时进行"有氧运动"和"阻力训练"的人, 在整个群体中的死亡风险最低。举重本身也可以降低各种原因造成的死亡风险，特别是"心血管疾病"的死亡风险。*

.全因死亡率
是指一定时期内, "各种原因导致的总死亡人数"与该"人群人口数"之比。它包括了所有死因的死亡率，即不论任何疾病原因导致的死亡，都算作死亡人数。

These activities don’t just keep us alive—they keep us healthier while we are living. We lose 3 to 8 percent of our muscle mass every decade after the age of 30 and more after age 60. But muscle strengthening allows us to push back against the aging process and build lean body mass. This fosters metabolic health and keeps us lifting our own suitcases and carrying our own groceries. Resistance training also builds better bones—muscles pull on bones, and in response, bones add new cells and get stronger, increasing bone mineral density, which is especially important for women as they age.

这些活动不仅让我们活着，还让我们在活着的时候保持健康。 **30 岁以后，我们每十年就会失去 3% 到 8% 的肌肉质量，而 60 岁以后，肌肉质量会减少更多。但"肌肉强化"可以让我们延缓衰老过程，增强瘦体重。**这促进了新陈代谢的健康，让我们能够自己提起行李箱并携带自己的杂货。*阻力训练还可以塑造更好的骨骼——肌肉拉动骨骼，作为回应，骨骼会增加新细胞并变得更强壮，从而增加骨矿物质密度，这对于随着年龄增长的女性尤其重要。*

In cancer survivors, studies show that muscle-strengthening exercises improved cancer-related fatigue and health-related quality of life. Resistance training also helps to prevent and control diabetes, in part by improving blood glucose storage and circulation. And studies have found that strength training is associated with reductions in anxiety and depression.

在癌症幸存者中，研究表明, "肌肉强化锻炼"可以改善癌症相关的疲劳和健康相关的生活质量。阻力训练还有助于预防和控制糖尿病，部分原因是改善血糖储存和循环。研究发现, *"力量训练"与"减少焦虑和抑郁"有关。*

It’s often wise to work large muscle groups before smaller ones, and it’s critical to allow sufficient rest between workouts. Those rest periods allow the all-important repair process to begin.

[.my2]
*通常明智的做法是先锻炼大肌肉群，然后再锻炼较小的肌肉群，并且在锻炼之间留出足够的休息时间也至关重要。这些休息时间可以让最重要的修复过程开始。*

Any form of resistance training will do—pulling on strong elastic bands, push-ups, free weights or weight machines—so long as it puts strain on your muscles. Experts advise that people start small so as not to get hurt. With weights, “you don’t have to immediately jump to hang cleans and deadlifts.”

任何形式的阻力训练都可以——拉动强力弹力带、俯卧撑、自由重量训练, 或举重器械——只要它能给你的肌肉带来压力。专家建议人们从小事做起，以免受到伤害。有了重量，“你不必立即跳起来进行悬垂和硬拉."



It’s important to increase weight and intensity over time, a concept known as progressive resistance. Completing three sets with a five-pound dumbbell is challenging for a beginner but provides little benefit to a gym regular. “If you keep doing the same thing over and over again, no adaptations occur.”

*随着时间的推移, 增加重量和强度非常重要，这一概念称为"渐进阻力"。用五磅重的哑铃完成三组, 对于初学者来说是一项挑战，但对健身房的常客来说几乎没有什么好处。 “如果你一遍又一遍地做同样的事情，就不会发生适应.”*
