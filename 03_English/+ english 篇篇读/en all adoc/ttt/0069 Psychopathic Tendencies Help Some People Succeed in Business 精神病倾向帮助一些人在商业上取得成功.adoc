精神病是多种相互作用特征的综合体。传统的精神病态思维模型, 关注的是卑鄙和去抑制。从心理学的角度来说，卑鄙是指不顾他人而积极寻求资源。抑制解除表现为缺乏冲动控制。具有这两种特质的人很少或根本没有同理心，并且很难控制自己的行为，往往会带来暴力后果。

作为最近重新思考的一部分，心理学家引入了一个新因素：大胆，他们将其定义为社会主导地位、情绪弹性和冒险精神的结合。

你可以将大胆视为在与他人互动时表现出的无所畏惧，在这种情况下，你不会轻易被吓倒，你会更加自信，甚至会在他人面前占主导地位。

在高度卑鄙和去抑制的基础上加上大胆，你可能会发现一个精神病患者更能够利用他们的社会自信来掩盖他们的极端行为，从而在领导职位上表现出色。事实上，大胆的程度, 可能与具有传统精神病特征的人能否使自己的生活取得成功, 密切相关。

有些人甚至认为，精神变态的特征和相关倾向，如无所畏惧和自恋，可以使人们表现出英雄的行为。例如，2018 年的一项研究表明，急救人员在精神变态指标上的得分显着高于平民，包括无所畏惧的支配力、大胆和寻求刺激。

某些精神病态特征可能是积极的这一想法并不适合所有人。新加坡社会科学大学前组织心理学顾问克劳斯·J·坦普勒 (Klaus J. Templer) 表示：“关于这个问题，存在着一场非常非常大的争论。”

A 2021 study asked (v.) more than 1,000 students to agree or disagree with statements to probe (v.)追问；探究 traits including meanness (“*I do not mind* if `主` someone I dislike `谓` gets hurt”), disinhibition (“I have taken money from someone’s purse or wallet without asking”) and boldness (“I’m a born leader”).

坦普勒说，批评者对"将大胆作为精神变态特征的定义"提出了质疑。 2021 年的一项研究要求 1,000 多名学生同意或不同意一些陈述，以探究一些特质，包括卑鄙（“我不介意我不喜欢的人受到伤害”）、去抑制（“我不经询问就从某人的钱包或钱包里拿了钱”）和大胆（“我是天生的领导者”）。

结果表明，仅"刻薄"和"去抑制"程度的提升, 就可以解释自我报告的"反社会行为"的差异，例如攻击性、违反规则和吸毒。换句话说，"大胆程度"所起的作用, 在很大程度上是无关紧要的。

但帕特里克认为, 有些人不符合这种解释。其他研究发现，有些人在"卑鄙"或"抑制解除"方面得分高于大多数人，但他们似乎不会因反社会行为而陷入麻烦。"大胆"可能会带来不同：一些研究表明，"大胆"可以在幸福感和工作场所行为方面, 起到保护作用。

“他们会发现更容易与人闲聊和利用人等等，”帕特里克说。他补充说，这种成功的精神病患者, 可能完全不值得信任，但他们最初给人的印象是自信和有能力的。 “这就是大胆带来的东西。”

部分问题在于，试图研究精神病积极特征的研究人员没有自己版本的筛查工具来识别更严重的病例。为了弥补这一差距，华莱士帮助制定了成功的精神病态量表：该量表包含 54 个问题，旨在识别和评估普通人群的精神病态特征。“我认为这个规模是必要的，因为目前成功的精神病研究几乎就像在黑暗中摸索一样，”她说。“对于那些具有典型精神病特征的人，以及他们如何应对日常生活，我们还有很多不了解的地方。”

==== Psychopathic Tendencies Help Some People Succeed in Business

Psychopathy is a composite of several interacting traits. The traditional model of a psychopathic mind focuses on meanness and disinhibition. In psychological terms, meanness is aggressive resource-seeking without regard for others. Disinhibition shows itself as a lack of impulse control. People high in both traits feel little or no empathy and find it hard to control their actions, with often violent consequences.


As part of the recent rethink, psychologists have introduced a new factor: boldness, which they define as a mix of social dominance, emotional resiliency and venturesomeness.

You can think of boldness as fearlessness expressed in the realm of interactions with other people where you’re not intimidated easily, you’re more assertive, even dominant with other people.




you could have a psychopath who’s more able to use their social confidence to mask the extremes of their behavior and so excel in leadership positions. In fact, it may be that the degree of boldness correlates closely with whether someone with traditionally psychopathic traits can make their life a success.


Meanness, for example, often shows itself as a lack of empathy. “Within the corporate world, you want someone who can perform under pressure and make quick decisions, perhaps without displaying high levels of empathy, because they need to be able to make those cutthroat choices.



A 2016 study of employees in an Australian advertising agency, for example, found that senior executives scored higher than more junior staff on measures of behaviors linked to psychopathic traits — such as being initially charming, poised and calm, but also egocentric, remorseless and lacking in self-blame.


Some have even suggested that psychopathic traits and associated tendencies such as fearlessness and narcissism can make people behave in a heroic way. A 2018 study, for example, suggested that first responders scored significantly higher than civilians on measures of psychopathy, including fearless dominance, boldness and sensation-seeking.


The idea that some psychopathic traits could be positive does not sit well with everyone. “There has been a big, big fight about this,” says Klaus J. Templer, an organizational psychology consultant formerly of the Singapore University of Social Sciences.


Critics take issue with the inclusion of boldness as a defining psychopathic trait, Templer says. A 2021 study asked more than 1,000 students to agree or disagree with statements to probe traits including meanness (“I do not mind if someone I dislike gets hurt”), disinhibition (“I have taken money from someone’s purse or wallet without asking”) and boldness (“I’m a born leader”).


The results suggested that increased levels of meanness and disinhibition could explain the variance in self-reported antisocial behaviors, such as aggression, rule-breaking and drug-taking. In other words, boldness was largely irrelevant.


But Patrick thinks some people don’t fit that interpretation. Other research has identified people who score higher than most on meanness or disinhibition, but who don’t seem to get into trouble for antisocial behavior.

“They would find it easier to kind of schmooze with people and use people and so forth,” Patrick says. This type of successful psychopath may turn out to be completely untrustworthy, but they initially come across as assertive and capable, he adds. “That’s what boldness brings to the table.”
