尽管如此，仍有零星的证据表明，美国人对移民们日益增长的反感, 给一些工人带来了好处. 哈佛大学(Harvard University)的戈登•汉森(Gordon Hanson)认为，低技能移民的数量减少, 其影响, 在三个特定的职业中表现最突出: 即, 管家、建筑与地面维护工人, 和干墙安装工. 因为这些工作严重依赖外来的移民劳工，他们所提供的服务, 是无法通过国际贸易来进口的。根据《经济学人》的计算，这些职业的平均工资增长速度, 要比其他低薪工作快得多。

短期内明显的工资增长, 可能会鼓励政客们走得更远。受到总统法案的鼓舞，一些共和党参议员, 正在推动将移民人数削减一半，他们说，这样做, 是为了提高工人的工资。但是最近发表的几篇学术论文指出，当美国限制移民时，这些事件最终对本国工人没有什么好处，甚至可能伤害他们。

从所有这些论文中得出的教训是，随着时间的推移，经济会逐渐适应移民数量的下降。短期内，随着劳动力供应下降，本地工人很可能会得到工资上涨。但随后, 企业会重新调整生产方向，转向劳动密集型程度较低的生产上; 以前是由外国移民所做的工作, 现在由当地人来做, 但薪水可能变得更低; 而且在老板们转而投资于节省劳动力的机器后, 国内剩下的工人, 其工资也会被降低。

== <pure> Immigration to America is down. Wages are up


There are nonetheless scraps of evidence that  some workers  are benefiting from America’s growing antipathy to immigrants. Gordon Hanson of Harvard University suggests that if the impact of reduced low-skill migration is showing up anywhere, it will be in three particular occupations: housekeepers, building-and-grounds maintenance workers, and drywall installers. These occupations rely heavily on immigrant labour and  the services they provide  cannot be traded internationally. Average wages in those occupations are rising considerably faster than wages in other low-paid jobs, according to calculations by The Economist.


The apparent short-term boost to wages may encourage politicians to go further. Inspired by the president, some Republican senators are pushing to cut immigration by half  in order, they say, to boost workers’ wages. But  several recently published academic papers, looking at other occasions when America has clamped down on immigration,  suggest that these episodes ultimately offer little benefit to native workers — and may even harm them.

The lesson from all these papers is that, over time, the economy adjusts to a fall in the number of immigrants. In the short term, native workers may well see a wage boost  as labour supply falls. But businesses then [underline]#reorient# production [underline]#towards# less labour-intensive products; natives take jobs (previously occupied by foreign-born folk, which may be worse paid); and bosses invest in labour-saving machinery, which can reduce the pay of remaining workers.
