如果一个人性格中具有黑暗的一面，那么他看起来可能比性格更稳定的人更性感。 +
科学家们对100名受试者进行了性格测试，以评估他们的黑暗性格，即权谋主义、自恋和精神病态。然后为每位受试者拍不同的两组照片。一组是所谓的“装酷”，参与者穿衣时尚，显得很有个性。在“条件朴素”这一组，他们尽可能显得中性：头发被拉回原样，换上了灰色长运动裤和T恤，不化妆，也不戴任何饰品，就连面部表情也显得很中性化。 +
之后将这些照片拿给志愿者看，让他们评价这些人的魅力指数。结果志愿者普遍认为，具有黑暗性格的人在“装酷”的时候更有魅力。而那些不具有黑暗性格的人即使盛装打扮，烫染了头发也并不显得有魅力。这项研究发表在《社会心理和人格科学》杂志上。

伊利诺伊州布拉德雷大学进行的另一个研究，对象扩及57国、35000人，也发现坏男人较能赢得女性青睐。研究主持人史密特教授说：“黑暗性格分数越高的男人，越会逢场作戏、短暂谈爱，放诸四海皆然，不受文化或国家限制。”

In fact, people with dark personalities may look hotter when they try harder than do those with more stable character traits.

Scientists gave personality tests to more than 100 subjects to rate them for what's called Dark Triad trait — that's Machiavellianism, narcissism and psychopathy. They then took different photographs of each subject.

One was a so-called “adorned condition” where the participants were turned out clothed and styled.
In the “unadorned condition” they were presented [as neutrally as possible]: their hair was pulled back, they changed into grey sweat pants and tee shirts, and they wore no makeup or other adornments. And they maintained neutral facial expressions.

The pictures were then shown to volunteers who rated them for attractiveness. And the people who exhibited the Dark Triad traits were rated as significantly more attractive in the adorned state than in their unadorned state. But the subjects who did not have dark traits did not get an attractiveness boost from getting dressed up and coiffed. The study is the journal Social Psychological Personality and Science.
