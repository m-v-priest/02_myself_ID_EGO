==  Memorable images make time pass more slowly 难忘的画面让时间过得更慢


TIME *FAMOUSLY speeds up* /when you are having fun. But it slows down, it turns out, when one *looks at* something 后定 worth remembering.

[.my2]
当你玩得开心时，时间会过得很快。但事实证明，当一个人看到一些值得记住的东西时，它就会变慢。


They showed _several dozen participants_ images of different scenes — *from* empty box rooms *to* filled (a.) stadiums — for between 300 and 900 milliseconds 毫秒. After each one /the participants had to say /if `主` #the time# 后定 spent looking at the image `系` #was# short or long. Their responses revealed (v.) that, when the images featured (v.)以……为特色 large scenes, such as a vacant 空着的；未被占用的 warehouse, more time seemed to have passed. The opposite happened /when the images *were* of spaces 后定 cluttered with objects, such as an overfull 过多的；太满的 garage 停车房；车库;（兼营汽车销售、修理及加油的）汽车修理厂.

他们(A team led by Martin Wiener, a cognitive neuroscientist 认知神经科学家 at George Mason University in America ) 向几十名参与者展示了不同场景的图像——从空荡荡的包厢, 到人满为患的体育场——持续 300 到 900 毫秒。每一张图片结束后，参与者都必须说出观看图像的时间, 是短还是长。他们的反应表明，*当图像出现大场景时，例如空置的仓库，似乎已经过去了更长的时间。当图像中的空间杂乱地堆满物体（例如超满的车库）时，就会发生相反的情况。*


Humans better remember pictures `谓` *focused on* people, actions and centrally placed objects. Dr Wiener’s team used images from a 60,000-image _data set_ 数据集, where each image had been judged [on its memorability  值得记忆；难忘的人] (a man with flowers in his beard 胡须: memorable 值得纪念的；难忘的. Foliage （植物的）叶；枝叶: less so 不那么).

**人类更容易记住以人物、动作, 和位于中心的物体为中心的图片。**维纳博士的团队使用了来自 60,000 张图像数据集的图像，其中每张图像都根据其记忆性进行评判（*胡子上插着鲜花的男人：令人难忘。树叶：不太好记*）。

The more memorable the image, the more it seemed to stretch (v.) time. It also worked *in reverse*: when participants were called back to the lab /a day later, they were better at remembering (v.) the time-slowing pictures.

**图像越令人难忘，时间似乎就越被拉长。**它也起到了相反的作用：当参与者一天后被叫回实验室时，他们更容易记住时间放慢的图片。

"处理速度"究竟如何导致"时间感知"改变, 尚不清楚，但研究人员认为，这种联系在于大脑如何优先考虑传入的信息。他们提出了一种新模型，在该模型中，大脑在遇到重要、相关或难忘的事情时会尝试进行更多处理。他们认为，这样做是为了让时间看起来过得更慢，这可能是在身体做出反应之前"完成更多处理"的一种方式。维纳博士说，例如，如果一个人与捕食者面对面，更持续的思想爆发可能会有用。

== (pure) Memorable images make time pass more slowly




TIME FAMOUSLY speeds up when you are having fun. But it slows down, it turns out, when one looks at something worth remembering.


They showed several dozen participants images of different scenes—from empty box rooms to filled stadiums—for between 300 and 900 milliseconds. After each one the participants had to say if the time spent looking at the image was short or long. Their responses revealed that, when the images featured large scenes, such as a vacant warehouse, more time seemed to have passed. The opposite happened when the images were of spaces cluttered with objects, such as an overfull garage.



Humans better remember pictures focused on people, actions and centrally placed objects. Dr Wiener’s team used images from a 60,000-image data set, where each image had been judged on its memorability (a man with flowers in his beard: memorable. Foliage: less so).


The more memorable the image, the more it seemed to stretch time. It also worked in reverse: when participants were called back to the lab a day later, they were better at remembering the time-slowing pictures.


Exactly how processing speed leads to altered time perception is still unclear, but the researchers believe the connection lies in how the brain prioritises incoming information. They propose a new model in which the brain tries to do more processing when it encounters something important, relevant or memorable. It does so, they suggest, by making seconds seem to pass slower, possibly as a way to get more processing done before the body reacts. If a human came face-to-face with a predator, for example, a more sustained burst of thought might be useful, says Dr Wiener.
