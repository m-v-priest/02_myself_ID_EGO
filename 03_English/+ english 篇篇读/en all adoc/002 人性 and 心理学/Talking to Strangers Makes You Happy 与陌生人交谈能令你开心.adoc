But *contrary to* 与……相反 what we might think, we’d be happier /if we did *strike up* （和某人）建立友谊，开始来往，交谈起来 a conversation with a total stranger.

[.my2]
想象一下您乘坐地铁、登机或进入候诊室的次数。您很可能避免与任何其他通勤者或患者接触。但与我们想象的相反，如果我们与一个完全陌生的人交谈，确实会令我们感到更高兴。

In a study, commuters in Chicago were asked to #either# talk with a stranger on a train, #or# sit quietly alone, or just do whatever they’d normally do on their commute 通勤. Then, they responded to a survey about how they felt.

在一项研究中，芝加哥的通勤者被要求, 要么在火车上与陌生人交谈，要么独自安静地坐着，要么只是做他们日常在通勤时会做的事情。然后，他们回答了一项有关他们感受的调查。



Turns out 结果是,事实证明 those who engaged with strangers /had the most pleasurable experience /and those who remained solitary (a.)独自的；单独的 /had the least enjoyable experience.

These answers were compared with another group /that did not participate but instead had to predict how they might feel in each situation. This group thought (v.) /talking with strangers would be the least enjoyable, by far.

事实证明，那些与陌生人交往的人, 有最愉快的经历，而那些保持孤独的人, 则有最不愉快的经历。这些答案与另一组被试进行了比较, 后者一组没有参与此次试验, 但必须来预测一下他们在每种情况下会有如何的感受。到目前为止, 这后一组的群体预测认为，与陌生人交谈是最不愉快的。

So despite *being* social animals /and enjoying social engagement, we avoid chatting with strangers. Why? Well, according to a follow up  对…采取进一步行动；…后接着 study /it’s because we think, wrongly, that strangers don’t want to talk with us. The one way to get over 克服，战胜（问题、困难）；（使）渡过；走完 this /is to practice (v.) reaching out （使）伸出 – who knows, commuting could become more enjoyable.

因此，尽管我们是社交动物, 并享受社交活动，但我们会避免与陌生人聊天。为什么？嗯，根据一项后续研究，这是因为我们错误地认为陌生人不想与我们交谈。克服这个问题的一种方法是练习伸出手——谁知道呢，通勤可能会变得更加愉快。

== (pure) Talking to Strangers Makes You Happy

Consider the times you’ve hopped on a subway, boarded a plane or entered a waiting room. Chances are, you probably avoided engaging with any fellow commuters or patients. But contrary to what we might think, we’d be happier if we did strike up a conversation with a total stranger.

In a study, commuters in Chicago were asked to either talk with a stranger on a train, or sit quietly alone, or just do whatever they’d normally do on their commute. Then, they responded to a survey about how they felt.

Turns out those who engaged with strangers had the most pleasurable experience and those who remained solitary had the least enjoyable experience. These answers were compared with another group that did not participate but instead had to predict how they might feel in each situation. This group thought talking with strangers would be the least enjoyable, by far.

So despite being social animals and enjoying social engagement, we avoid chatting with strangers. Why? Well, according to a follow up study it’s because we think, wrongly, that strangers don’t want to talk with us. The one way to get over this is to practice reaching out – who knows, commuting could become more enjoyable.
