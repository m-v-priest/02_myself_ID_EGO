== Why so few rapists are convicted (v.)证明……有罪；宣判（某人）有罪


Rape is one of the hardest crimes to prosecute 起诉；控告；检举. After a murder, there is a corpse 尸体. After a rape, by contrast 相比之下, there may be no physical evidence at all.

[.my2]
强奸是最难起诉的罪行之一。谋杀之后，会有一具尸体。相比之下，强奸之后可能根本就没有物证。

Often, 主 the only evidence that a crime has even occurred 系 is the word of the victim 受害者, flatly (ad.)断然；斩钉截铁地 contradicted 反驳；驳斥 by the defendant.

[.my2]
通常，犯罪发生的唯一证据, 就是受害者的话，而被告则断然否认。

When it is essentially 本质上；根本上 her word against his, it can be extremely difficult to prove *beyond reasonable doubt* 无疑地; 确实地; 排除合理的怀疑;无可置疑 that the accuser 原告 is telling the truth and the defendant 被告 is lying.

[.my2]
当她的话与他的相反时，就很难确实地证明, 原告说的是实话，而被告在撒谎。

It is doubly (ad.)更加；越发；倍加 so /when _the general public_  — and therefore jurors 陪审员 —  have deep misconceptions 错误认识；误解 about what _a typical rape_ looks like, and what _a credible  可信的；可靠的 allegation_ （无证据的）说法，指控 sounds like.

[.my2]
当公众——因而也是陪审员们——对典型的强奸是什么样子，以及可信的指控听起来像是什么样子, 有很深的误解时，情况就更是如此。

People often think of rape as involving things 后定 conspicuously 显著地，明显地 missing (v.) from Jane’s account: a predatory (a.)（在金钱或性关系上）欺负弱小的，压榨他人的;捕食性的 stranger, a weapon used (v.) to threaten or hurt, a secluded (a.) 僻静的；清静的；不受打扰的 location and a victim anxious (a.) to report (v.) the crime *straight away* 立即；马上.

[.my2]
许多面对这两种说法的人, 会觉得乔的说法更可信。人们通常认为, 强奸会涉及简的描述中明显缺失了的几样东西：在性需求上呈掠食性的陌生人，用于造成威胁或伤害人的武器，一个隐蔽的作案地点，以及一位急于立马报案的受害者。

They are mistaken. “Most common knowledge about _sexual assault_ is wrong,” said Barbara Ziv, a forensic 法医的;与法庭有关的 psychiatrist 精神病学家；精神科医生.

"他们的这种认识是错的", 法医精神病学家芭芭拉·齐夫(Barbara Ziv)说.

== <pure> Why so few rapists are convicted


Rape is one of the hardest crimes to prosecute. After a murder, there is a corpse. After a rape, by contrast, there may be no physical evidence at all. Often, the only evidence that a crime has even occurred is the word of the victim, flatly contradicted by the defendant. When it is essentially her word against his, it can be extremely difficult to prove [beyond reasonable doubt] that the accuser is telling the truth and the defendant is lying. It is doubly so [when the general public  — and therefore jurors — have deep misconceptions about what a typical rape looks like, and what a credible allegation sounds like].

Many people faced with these two accounts will find Joe’s more credible. People often think of rape as involving things (conspicuously missing  from Jane’s account): a predatory stranger, a weapon used to threaten or hurt, a secluded location and a victim anxious to report the crime [straight away]. They are mistaken. “Most common knowledge about sexual assault is wrong,” said Barbara Ziv, a forensic psychiatrist.

Many reports are made [long after the event]; more than a quarter of attacks reported in England and Wales in 2017  took place over a year before. Some 80% of rapes (reported) are committed by a person (known to the victim).

Sexual assault typically involves neither weapons nor visible injuries. The 2017 Crime Survey for England and Wales found the most common location to be the victim’s home (39%) and the second most common the offender’s home (24%). Just 10% happen in a public place such as a park or the street. 主 Nearly a third of people claiming to be the victims of rape said {they told no one}; over half told an acquaintance; fewer than one in five told the police.

Victims may not report their ordeal for a number of reasons, such as embarrassment or thinking it will not help. They may remain in contact with their assailant for work reasons. They may flirt with him or have sex with him again as a way to regain, or establish, a sense of control over their relationship.

Jurors can find this hard to fathom. Defence lawyers exploit their confusion. [Soon after allegations against Mr Weinstein surfaced] two New York Times reporters revealed {how Mr Weinstein’s then lawyer, Lisa Bloom, had tried to reassure board members of his company by saying photographs  would soon be published of “several of the accusers in very friendly poses with Harvey after his alleged misconduct”}. When such evidence reveals a continued relationship that the accuser has sought to hide, it can be relevant. The mere fact of a continued relationship, though, says little.

The absence of a weapon; missing, imprecise or mistaken memories; delayed reporting; prior acquaintance; claims of consent — they all make a rape complaint more likely to be dismissed by investigators, even though they are extremely common.

And by the fact that Mr Weinstein doesn’t look like George Clooney, adds Bennett Capers, a professor at Brooklyn Law School. [If Joe is good-looking] both men and women are more likely to believe him than if he is not.

The greater the power differential between rapist and victim, the likelier he is to get away with it, reckon criminal-justice scholars. Jurors are especially likely to disbelieve victims if they are sex workers, drug addicts or teenagers.


In a study (recently released by America’s National Criminal Justice Reference Service), researchers followed the flow of reports of rape and attempted rape in six American jurisdictions between 2008 and 2012. [Of 2,887 reports by women] just a fifth led to an arrest. Only 1.6% of incidents (reported)  led to a trial. “Police and prosecutors selected cases based on what they thought a jury would believe,” says Linda Williams, one of the study’s authors.

Rape was second only to robbery as the least-solved violent crime. Lower clearance rates might be a sign that police are keeping complex cases open for longer. But it could equally indicate that more rapes are going unsolved.


The ways in which the mind remembers, and forgets, assault  can work to the accuser’s disadvantage. Memory of trauma can record some particulars [in excruciating detail] while leaving other details hazy or forgotten.

Alcohol adds to the difficulties. [In England and Wales] over a third of self-reported rape victims said they had drunk alcohol when they were attacked. Heavy drinking can cause blackouts as well as removing the capacity for consent. Even moderate drinking can blur the memory of peripheral details.


The body, too, does not necessarily record the evidence people might expect. Non-consensual sex does not always lead to injury or physical trauma. One reason is “tonic immobility”, a dissociative response in which the body goes limp. Two thirds of rape of victims questioned in a Swedish study reported symptoms of tonic immobility. “Victims are still suspected of lying if their vulvas aren’t visibly shredded after a rape,” writes Kate Harding, a feminist author, in “Asking for It”.
