== A manager’s manifesto 宣言 for 2020

[.my1]
.案例
====
.manifesto
(n.) a written statement in which a group of people, especially a political party, explain their beliefs and say what they will do if they win an election 宣言 +
- an election manifesto 竞选宣言
====

1-. Give out some praise. People don’t come to work just for the money. They like to feel they are making a valuable contribution. Praise doesn’t have to happen every day /and it cannot be generic (a.) 一般的；普通的；通用的.

[.my2]
给予一些赞美。人们来工作,不只是为了钱。他们喜欢感觉到自己做了有价值的贡献。你不需要每天都给予赞美，但赞美时,也不能泛泛而谈。

Pick something specific 后定 that a worker has done which shows extra skill or effort /and single them out  单独挑出; ideally (ad.)完美的；理想的；最合适的 so that 因此 others can hear the compliment 赞扬；称赞.
This is particularly important for the most junior 地位（或职位、级别）低下的 employees, who will feel anxious about their status.

[.my2]
挑选出某位员工做过的能表现出他们行使了额外技能或努力的事例，将这位员工挑选出来, 表扬他; 最理想的是让别人听到你的赞美。这对初级的员工尤为重要，因为他们一般会对自己的地位, 感到焦虑。




2-. Remember that you set the tone.
If a manager is angry and swears  咒骂；诅咒；说脏话 a lot, that will be seen as acceptable behaviour.
If bosses barely 几乎不；几乎没有 communicate, they are unlikely to receive useful feedback.
And if a manager frequently belittles  (v.)贬低；小看 a particular employee, that person is unlikely to get the respect of their colleagues.


[.my2]
记住，你定下了基调(即, 你的言行是怎样的, 你部门的文化就是怎样的)。
如果一个经理易怒，经常骂人，则这将被你的部属视为可以接受的行为(上梁不正下梁歪)。如果老板很少与员工交流，那他们就不太可能得到员工们对其有用的反馈。如果他们不能兑现自己的承诺，则员工们也不太可能与其合作。如果一个经理经常贬低某个员工，则他(即被贬低的员工)就不太可能得到其他同事的尊重。



4-. *Make* your priorities 优先事项；最重要的事；首要事情 for the next year *clear*, and communicate (v.) them well.
Is the company or division （机构的）部门) trying to launch a new product? Or to boost (v.) sales of existing products? Or to control costs? If you are not sure, then 主 those who work for you 谓 will have no idea. That can lead to a lot of wasted effort.

[.my2]
明确明年的工作重点，并做好沟通。公司(或部门)正在尝试推出新产品吗? 或者是要促进现有产品的销售? 还是需要控制成本? 这会导致大量的努力被白费。

5-. To that end 为了实现那个目标, cut out 删除；删去;裁剪 the jargon 行话；黑话；行业术语；切口.
The use of pretentious 炫耀的；虚夸的；自命不凡的 phrases and complex acronyms 首字母缩略词 /is generally designed to obfuscate (v.) （故意地）混淆，使困惑，使模糊不清 rather than 而不是 elucidate (v.) 阐明；解释；说明.
In Bartleby’s experience, 主 the reason people use unclear language 系 is that they have nothing clear to say.

[.my2]
去使用自命不凡的短语, 和复杂的缩写词的这种行为, 往往目的是为了"故意令人难以理解", 而不是为了"阐明清楚"。根据巴特比的经验，人们之所以使用含糊不清的语言，是因为他们没有明确的话要说。


If you are sending a general memo to all the staff, look carefully through it /and ask whether you would have understood it on your first day of work. If not, make it simpler.
Remember George Orwell’s maxim 格言；箴言；座右铭: “Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word  /if you can think of an everyday English equivalent (n.) 相等的东西；等量；对应词.” It applies to other tongues  说话方式,语言, too.

[.my2]
如果你要给所有的员工发一份备忘录，先仔细看一遍，问问自己在第一天上班时是否就理解它。如果不是，就让这些话语变得更简单。记住乔治•奥威尔(George Orwell)的格言:“如果你能想出一个日常英语中的对等词，就永远不要去使用外国短语、科学词汇或行话。” 它也适用于其他语言。

[.my1]

“would have understood it”是英语语法中的一种虚拟完成时态。它用于描述过去的假设情况，但实际上并没有发生。 +

== <pure> A manager’s manifesto for 2020




1-. Give out some praise. People don’t come to work just for the money. They like to feel  they are making a valuable contribution. Praise doesn’t have to happen every day and it cannot be generic. Pick something specific that a worker has done which shows extra skill or effort and single them out; ideally so that others can hear the compliment. This is particularly important for the most junior employees, who will feel anxious  about their status.


2-. Remember that you set the tone. If a manager is angry and swears a lot, that will be seen as acceptable behaviour. If bosses barely communicate, they are unlikely  to receive useful feedback. If they fail to keep their promises, workers will be less likely  to co-operate. And if a manager frequently belittles a particular employee, that person is unlikely to get the respect of their colleagues.


4-. Make your priorities (for the next year) clear, and communicate them well. Is the company (or division) trying to launch a new product? Or to boost  sales of existing products? Or to control costs? If you are not sure, then  those who work for you will have no idea. That can lead to a lot of wasted effort.

5-. To that end, cut out the jargon. The use of pretentious phrases and complex acronyms is generally designed to obfuscate  rather than elucidate. In Bartleby’s experience, the reason (people use unclear language) is that they have nothing clear to say. If you are sending a general memo to all the staff, look carefully through it and ask {whether you would have understood it [on your first day of work]}. If not, make it simpler. Remember George Orwell’s maxim: “Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word [if you can think of an everyday English equivalent].” It applies to other tongues, too.
