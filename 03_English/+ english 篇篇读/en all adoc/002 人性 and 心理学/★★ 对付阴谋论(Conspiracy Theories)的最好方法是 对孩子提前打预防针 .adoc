A new review finds that `主` only some methods to counteract (v.)抵制；抵消；抵抗 conspiracy 密谋策划；阴谋 beliefs 阴谋论信念 `系` are effective. Here’s what works (v.) and what doesn’t.

The study is a review of research 后定 on attempts to counteract (v.) conspiratorial thinking, and it finds that /common strategies that involve counterarguments  抗辩; 反驳 and fact-checking 核实,真相核查 /`谓` largely fail to change (v.) people’s beliefs.

“We’re still in #the early days#, unfortunately, #of# having a silver bullet that will tackle (v.)应付，处理，解决（难题或局面） misinformation [as a whole 总的来说],” says Cian O’Mahony, a doctoral  博士的；博士学位的 student in psychology at University College Cork in Ireland, who led the study.

“不幸的是，我们仍处于早期阶段，我们还处于解决整个错误信息的灵丹妙药的早期阶段，”领导这项研究的爱尔兰科克大学心理学博士生 Cian O'Mahony 说。

有几类干预措施。其中一项包括"启动研究"，它使用一个不相关的任务来改变一个人的心态。例如，被试者可能会被要求读一篇字体很难阅读的文章，这需要花费更多的精力来吸收信息, 并激起"分析性思维"。然后，研究人员可能会向参与者展示一个阴谋论，看看那个启动任务, 是否会降低他们对此阴谋论的信念。这些研究表明，启动任务大多起作用，但通常只有很小的影响。 +
另一种"用事实来反驳阴谋论"的策略, 也只显示出"很小"或"小"的效果。 +
最无效的辩论策略包括: 试图申诉于阴谋论信徒的同理心, 或嘲笑他们的信仰。

Politicians use this “inoculate (v.)（给…）接种，打预防针 against inoculation” strategy [in the real world].

[.my2]
**更有希望的方法, 是"接种教育"，它提前警告人们他们可能会看到阴谋论，并为他们提供反对的理由。**在"减少阴谋论信仰"中, 这些方法有从"中"到"大"的影响力。但是, "接种"策略, 也可能会被反向应用。一项研究发现，如果一个阴谋论贩子, 事先警告潜在信徒, 不要去做接种，那么该"接种策略"将不再有效。政治家在现实世界中, 已经在使用这种对"接种"打"反接种疫苗” 的策略。例如，佛罗里达州州长罗恩·德桑蒂斯 (Ron DeSantis) 用这种策略来附和他的论点，他说:"教师正在向学生灌输'醒过来'的议程，并用诸如'任何告诉你这件事没有发生的人, 都是在骗你'之类的短语。你们不要相信那些老师说的话!"

避免"阴谋论思维"的最佳方式, 机会, 可能还是需要花费大力气才能实现。在新的分析中，"能带来最大的影响"的策略之一, 来自一项涉及为期三个月的大学课程的研究，该课程旨在区分科学与伪科学。在这项研究中，三位教师, 教授学生"批判性思维技能"，帮助他们理解人类常见的感知和逻辑错误。结果是"阴谋论信念"减少了。 “虽然这只是一项单一的研究，但它确实强调了要"明确教授这些技能"的必要性，”奥马霍尼说。

如果说, "改变根深蒂固的阴谋论信念"很难，那么让人们相信阴谋论, 其实也很难，这与流行的观念相反。乌辛斯基说，改变任何一种根深蒂固的信念, 都是具有挑战性的. 尤其是当这些信念与某人的"世界观"密切相关时。有时候人们选择他们想要的信仰，或做他们想做的事，只是源于他们认为自己应该是谁。(屁股决定脑袋)

对于有兴趣挑战阴谋论思维的个人，<新评论>刊物的作者提供了一些"有用的策略"提示： +
1.不要诉诸情感。研究表明，"情绪策略"对改变信念不起作用。 +
2.不要陷入"对事实论据的争论"。作者发现，关于阴谋论的事实, 或相信"特定阴谋会带来何种后果"的争论, 作用也没有太大的不同。 +
3.*注重"预防性策略", 即实现打疫苗。最好的策略似乎包括: 在人们接触到特定信念之前, 就帮助他们识别不可靠的信息, 和不可信的来源。* +
4.支持"教育和分析"。将人们置于"批判性分析思维模式", 并明确教导他们如何评估信息, 这种方式, 似乎才最能防止阴谋论。

== <pure> Conspiracy Theories Can Be Undermined with These Strategies, New Analysis Shows


A new review finds that only some methods to counteract conspiracy beliefs are effective. Here’s what works and what doesn’t.

The study is a review of research on attempts to counteract conspiratorial thinking, and it finds that common strategies that involve counterarguments and fact-checking largely fail to change people’s beliefs. The most promising ways to combat conspiratorial thinking seem to involve prevention, either warning people ahead of time about a particular conspiracy theory or explicitly teaching them how to spot shoddy evidence.

“We’re still in the early days, unfortunately, of having a silver bullet that will tackle misinformation as a whole,” says Cian O’Mahony, a doctoral student in psychology at University College Cork in Ireland, who led the study.

There were a few categories of interventions. One consisted of priming studies, which used an unrelated task to shift someone’s mindset. For instance, participants might be asked to read a passage in a hard-to-read font, which requires more work to take in information and prompts an analytic mindset. Then researchers might present the participants with a conspiracy theory to see if this task decreases belief. These studies suggested that priming mostly worked, but it generally had only small effects. Another strategy of arguing against conspiracy theories with facts also showed only very small to small effects. The least effective arguments involved appealing to a believer’s sense of empathy or mocking them for their beliefs.

More promising were inoculation studies, which warned people ahead of time that they might see a conspiracy theory and gave them an argument against it. These had medium to large impacts on decreasing conspiracy belief. Inoculation can backfire, however. One study found that if a conspiracy peddler warned against an inoculation approach, that inoculation would no longer work. Politicians use this “inoculate against inoculation” strategy in the real world. For example, Florida governor Ron DeSantis has taken to accompanying his arguments that teachers are indoctrinating students with a “woke” agenda with phrases such as “Anyone that tells you it’s not happening is lying to you.”

The best opportunity to avoid conspiratorial thinking may be the most labor-intensive. In the new analysis, one of the largest effects came from a study that involved a three-month university class aimed at distinguishing science from pseudoscience.

The result was a reduction in conspiracy beliefs. “This was a singular study, but it did highlight teaching these skills explicitly,” O’Mahony says.

If it’s hard to change entrenched conspiracy beliefs, the silver lining is that it’s also hard to make people believe in conspiracies, contrary to popular conception.  Changing entrenched beliefs of any kind is challenging, Uscinski says, especially if those beliefs are closely tied to someone’s worldview.

3.Focus on prevention. The best strategies seem to involve helping people recognize unreliable information and untrustworthy sources before they’re exposed to a specific belief.

4.Support education and analysis. Putting people into an analytic mindset and explicitly teaching them how to evaluate information appears most protective against conspiracy rabbit holes.
