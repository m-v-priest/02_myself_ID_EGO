== 如何让你对自己选择更满意

Decisions can be hard. We may be haunted (表情)焦虑的,忧心忡忡的,闹鬼的 by the path not taken.

But the best way to feel better about the one choice we do make /may be to put up a literal 字面上的,原义的,确确实实的 barrier 障碍 to any of the other choices.

In a recent study, some participants had to choose a chocolate from a box 后定 holding a selection 可供选择的事物 of 24 chocolates. Others picked from a box containing just six chocolates. Each box had a transparent lid 盖子. Some were told to just pick (v.) one and taste it. Others had to pick one, but close the lid again before tasting it. Then all participants were asked to rate 评级 their chocolate.

`主` #Those# who *put* a transparent lid *back* on the box *immediately* after choosing from the 24 chocolates /`谓` #enjoyed# their candy *more than* those who lingered 继续存留,留恋；不愿离开 with the lid open — even though both groups could see the chocolates not chosen!

What about the six-chocolate box? Closing the lid had no effect on chocolate rankings. The study is the Journal of Consumer Research.

The researchers say /other studies show that /when we start with fewer options /we don't tend to ruminate (v.) on 沉思;琢磨;认真考虑 other choices, or even compare (v.)对比 options. We simply like what we get.

Just don't put back any half eaten chocolates.

做选择并不容易, 尤其是选择太多时.  +
试验:

[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]

|Header 1 |Header 2

|甲盒子中(盒子有透明盖子), 有24种巧克力
|乙盒子中(盒子有透明盖子), 有6种巧克力

|- A组人: 选一块巧克力, 在盖子开着的情况下, 吃巧克力.
- B组人: 选一块巧克力, 把盖子盖上后, 再吃巧克力. -> 报告说, 比A组人更喜欢他们选的巧克力.
|- A组人 和 B组人, 对巧克力的评价没有区别.
|===

结论就是: 当你只有较少的选择时, 你就不太会去纠结你没选的那些东西. 也不太会去进行更多比较. 这样, 你就更容易对自己所得到的东西感到满意.
