== Your Kid Is Probably Not an ‘Orchid’ or a ‘Dandelion’— But Could Be Both. 你的孩子可能不是“兰花”或“蒲公英”，而可能两者都是

Not all children, adolescents 青少年 or even adults are equally susceptible  (a.)易受影响（或伤害等）；敏感 to the effects of experience.

事实是，与许多其他领域一样，发展科学主要关注平均效应，这些效应可以掩盖也可以揭示很多东西。并非所有的儿童、青少年甚至成年人都同样容易受到经验的影响。*正如我过去的研究表明的那样，有些孩子受环境的影响很大，而其他孩子似乎不受影响。出于这个原因，前一组从干预中受益，并遭受诸如严厉惩罚或同伴拒绝等不利经历。但后者的孩子受这些相同暴露的影响要小得多。*

..._the popularized terminology_ （某学科的）术语 of “orchid 兰科植物；兰花 children” for those especially susceptible to environmental influences /and “dandelion 蒲公英 children” for kids that seemed to be minimally 最低限度地；最低程度地 shaped by such effects. Some researchers *have taken* that flower language *further*, positing (v.)假定; 假设 the existence of “tulips 郁金香,” who *are moderately 有合理限度地，适中地 influenced* (v.) by their experiences.

But _this line 种类；类型 of thinking_ risks (v.) implying 暗示，暗指 that, at any given level — orchid, tulip 郁金香 or dandelion 蒲公英 — young people will be influenced by all aspects of their environment [to the same extent]. I have always had questions about that point.

**术语“兰花型儿童”指的是那些特别容易受到环境影响的人，而“蒲公英型儿童”指的是似乎很少受这种影响影响的孩子。一**些研究人员进一步采用了这种用花来做比喻的术语，*他们假定还存在“郁金香型儿童”，即他们只会受到其经历的"适中"程度的影响。* +
*但这种思路有可能暗示，在任何给定的层次——兰花、郁金香或蒲公英——年轻人都会在相同程度上受到环境各个方面的影响。我一直对这一点有疑问。*

.orchid
/ˈɔːrkɪd/ +
-> 英语中表示“兰花”的单词orchid来自希腊语orchis（睾丸）。因为兰花是孖根植物，根部与男子睾丸一样成双成对且形状相似。在古英语中“兰花”和“睾丸”都是orchid，后来为了避免误解和文雅，就用testicle来表示“睾丸”，而用orchid 专指兰花。

.dandelion
/ˈdændɪlaɪən/ +
-> 汉语通称“蒲公英”，别称“黄花地丁”。由于这种植物叶子呈齿状，所以法语称dent de lion．意即tooth of the lion（狮子的牙齿）。

In several studies, we have looked at multiple environmental influences and their effects on large groups of children. We have found an intriguing 非常有趣的；引人入胜的 pattern: While 虽然；尽管 true tulips, dandelions 蒲公英 and orchids may exist, many kids are indeed a mosaic 镶嵌图案；马赛克.

在几项研究中，我们研究了多种环境影响及其对大群儿童的影响。我们发现了一个有趣的模式：*虽然真正的郁金香、蒲公英和兰花可能存在，但许多孩子确实是马赛克。最后一类中的儿童对某些影响敏感，但对其他影响不敏感。此外，他们的易感性可能会因时间而异：也就是说，当他们在发育过程中接触到特定的经历时.*

*In line with* 符合；与……一致 past work, some children —7 percent —were “orchids,” highly influenced by both parents and peers. In those cases, `主` positive, supportive relationships with family and friends /`系`  were linked to better adolescent 青少年,青春期的 adjustment — and `主` conflicted, difficult connections early in life /`系`  were associated with poorer functioning in adolescence. We also identified 10 percent of children who were “dandelions,” highly unsusceptible to both of these social influences, with no clear connection between the quality of their relationships and later behavior.

The middle ground 中间地带, however, was not simply “tulips” 后定 with moderate sensitivity to their relationships. In fact, 15 percent of kids proved (v.) highly susceptible to peers but not parents, and 19 percent showed the reverse pattern. Thus, there were quite a few “mosaics.”

与过去的研究一致，有些孩子(占7%)是“兰花型”的，他们会受到父母和同龄人的高度影响。在这些情况下，与家人和朋友的积极、支持的关系, 与他们更好的青春期适应有关，而生命早期的冲突、困难的关系, 与他们青春期功能较差有关。我们还确定了10%的孩子是“蒲公英”，他们对这两种社会影响都非常不敏感，他们的人际关系质量, 和后来的行为之间没有明确的联系。 +
然而，在中间地带中, 不仅仅只有对关系具有适度敏感性的“郁金香”型的人。事实上，有15%的孩子, 被证明非常容易受到同伴而不是父母的影响，有19%的孩子, 则表现出相反的模式。因此，有相当多的“马赛克”类型的孩子存在。

在最近的另一项研究中，我们仔细研究了一个普遍持有的假设，即"生命的前三到五年, 对塑造我们将成为什么样的人, 影响最大"。这一次，我们审查了每年进行的评估，这些评估是作为为 605,344 名丹麦儿童收集的公共记录的一部分。该数据集包括有关父母离婚、心理健康问题、监禁、失业和死亡的信息。值得注意的是，我们样本中的很多（尽管不是全部）年轻人, 在 5 岁之前, 和 13 至 18 岁之间, 都经历过艰难的家庭生活。 +

我们还有关于孩子在 18-19 岁时是否有问题的信息，例如没有完成学业, 或接受过心理健康诊断。当我们分析数据时，*我们发现, 不到三分之二的儿童 (62.1%) 看起来像兰花、郁金香或蒲公英类型，他们在两个发育阶段, 对逆境（或没有逆境）的敏感性相似。然而，在剩下的 600,000 多人中，有相当一部分是无可争议的马赛克类型：6.5% 的孩子非常容易受到早年逆境的影响，但他们在青春期阶段却非常不易受到影响. 而 6.7% 的孩子则相反。*

== <pure> Your Kid Is Probably Not an ‘Orchid’ or a ‘Dandelion’—But Could Be Both


The truth is that developmental science, like many other fields, is mostly focused on average effects, which can mask as much as they illuminate. Not all children, adolescents or even adults are equally susceptible to the effects of experience. As my past research has shown, some children are highly influenced by their environment, whereas others seem unsusceptible. For this reason, the former group benefits from interventions and suffers from adverse experiences such as harsh punishments or peer rejections. But the latter children will be much less affected by these same exposures.


But this line of thinking risks implying that, at any given level—orchid, tulip or dandelion—young people will be influenced by all aspects of their environment to the same extent. I have always had questions about that point.

In several studies, we have looked at multiple environmental influences and their effects on large groups of children. We have found an intriguing pattern: While true tulips, dandelions and orchids may exist, many kids are indeed a mosaic. The children in this last category are sensitive to some influences but not others. Plus their susceptibility may differ depending on timing: that is, when in their development they are exposed to a given experience.

In line with past work, some children—7 percent—were “orchids,” highly influenced by both parents and peers. In those cases, positive, supportive relationships with family and friends were linked to better adolescent adjustment—and conflicted, difficult connections early in life were associated with poorer functioning in adolescence. We also identified 10 percent of children who were “dandelions,” highly unsusceptible to both of these social influences, with no clear connection between the quality of their relationships and later behavior.

The middle ground, however, was not simply “tulips” with moderate sensitivity to their relationships. In fact, 15 percent of kids proved highly susceptible to peers but not parents, and 19 percent showed the reverse pattern. Thus, there were quite a few “mosaics.”

In another recent study, we took a closer look at a widely held assumption that the first three to five years of life are the most influential in shaping who we will become. This time, we reviewed assessments taken each year as part of the public records collected for 605,344 Danish children. This data set included information on parents’ divorce, mental health difficulties, incarceration, unemployment and death. Notably, a good many—though not all—of the young people in our sample were exposed to a difficult home life both before age five and between ages 13 and 18.

We also had information about whether the children had problems at ages 18-19, such as not completing schooling or receiving a mental health diagnosis. When we analyzed the data, we found that just under two thirds of the children (62.1 percent) looked like orchids, tulips or dandelions, with similar susceptibility to adversity (or its absence) at both developmental periods. Quite a few of the 600,000-plus individuals remaining were indisputable mosaics, however: 6.5 percent of kids were highly vulnerable to early-life adversity but highly unsusceptible in adolescence, and 6.7 percent manifested the reverse profile.

We conducted a third study that focused on some 40 different environmental effects for children between three months and 4.5 years of age. The factors we considered included family income, maternal depression and parenting behavior, as well as features of day care, such as quality of caregiving and the hours, months and years spent in such care. We linked these factors to both desirable traits—for instance, strong social and language skills—and undesirable ones—such as aggression and disobedience—just before the children started formal schooling at age 4.5. Once again, we found some orchids and dandelions, but the overwhelming majority of children were mosaics.

In other words, we should recognize each child as unique when it comes to what will and won’t shape their development.
