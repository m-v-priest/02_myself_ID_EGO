== The subtle ways that discrimination works 产生歧视的微妙方式

It starts at the recruitment 招聘 stage.
Women are put off  取消，撤销（与某人的会晤或安排）,使失去兴趣（或热情） from applying for jobs /that use words in their adverts 广告 such as “aggressive” or “ambitious”.
When one company changed its ad to focus on qualities such as enthusiasm and innovation 创新, and used a photo of a woman rather than a man, the proportion of female applicants  申请人（尤指求职） rose (v.) from 5% to 40%.

这种偏见, 从招聘阶段开始就显现出来。
当招聘广告中使用了“有进取心”或“雄心勃勃”等字眼时, 女性去申请这些工作, 却会被拒之门外。
但当一家公司把广告的重点, 放在热情和创新等品质上，并且使用女性而非男性的照片作为画面时，女性申请者的比例就从5%上升到了40%。

克里亚多·佩雷斯女士认为，当评估他们的表现时，女性会因为专横、粗暴或咄咄逼人的, 而受到批评，而男性则会被鼓励去变得更具攻击性。
*但是，当女性反过来去变得热情友好，她们又会被批评为不够专业* (里外都有话说, 欲加之罪何患无辞)。

2007年的一篇论文显示，那些认为自己在招聘时客观的人, 更有可能聘用另一名男性，而不是拥有相同资历的女性。
正如两位作者都认为的那样，防止歧视, 并不取决于白人男性自认为是否开明，而是取决于那些能换个角度看问题, 即能从女性的角度来看待工作环境的人, 所做出的决定。

== <pure> The subtle ways that discrimination


It starts at the recruitment stage. Women are put off from applying for jobs that use  words in their adverts such as “aggressive” or “ambitious”. When one company changed its ad to focus on qualities such as enthusiasm and innovation, and used a photo of a woman rather than a man, the proportion of female applicants rose from 5% to 40%.

When their performance is reviewed, Ms Criado Perez argues that women are criticised for being bossy, abrasive or strident, whereas men are encouraged to be more aggressive. But if women are warm and friendly, they get criticised for being insufficiently professional.


Those who believe {they are objective when recruiting} are nevertheless more likely to hire another man than a woman (with identical qualifications), as a paper from 2007 showed.

As both authors argue, preventing discrimination depends not on white men (discovering their inner liberal) but on decisions (being taken by those with broader perspectives).
