In a city of perfect people, +
no one was more perfect than Brooke. +
She was an interior designer who only dated A-list guys. +
For Brooke, every Saturday night was like the senior prom. +
So when she got married, +
we were all dying to see which one had made the cut. +
Hey! +
Was I the only one who remembered +
that Brooke once described this man +
as more boring than exposed brick? +
Molly, thank you so much. +
It was your average $100,000 wedding. +
Investment bankers and the women who hate them, +
classmates from Steiner, Dalton, and Brown. +
And us. +
We looked like The Witches of Eastwick . +
A wedding this size always has two singles tables. +
We were at the other one. +
Hello. +
Hi. I'm Bernie Turtletaub, friend of the groom. +
It was The Turtle. +
A Manhattan legend known for two things. +
Good investments and bad breath. +
God, my feet are killing me. +
Here, sit down. I can't. +
This outfit only works if I'm standing. +
Oh, I think it works either way. +
You know, I-- I think I'm at that table over there. +
Your friend is gorgeous. +
What do I have to do to get to know her better? +
Do you think the pears in this tart are Bosc or Bartlett? +
Who cares? +
Two hours later, we were bored. +
Supplies were dwindling, +
and one of our passengers had jumped ship. +
So are we going to stick around and catch the bouquet? +
That is so not going to happen. +
Bosc! They've got to be Bosc. +
Oh, can you believe I finally did it? +
Mm! You're next! +
Bill's got some great single friends. +
It's always better to marry someone +
who loves you more than you love them. +
People are always telling me things +
I don't want to hear. +
But this one crossed the line. +
Hey. Did I wake you? +
Not at all. +
Question. +
Why do people get married +
if they're not in love? +
I don't know. +
Companionship. Guilt... +
Political asylum? +
Well, why did you get married? +
I was a fool in love. +
Oh, that is so sweet. +
Hmm. And then, I was a fool in divorce court. +
Yeah, and now, you're just a fool. +
Exactly, which is why I'm never getting married again. +
Suddenly, I had to concentrate on breathing. +
Are you in bed with someone? +
No, are you? +
Just three slices of wedding cake. +
Are you jealous? +
That depends. +
What are your plans for the frosting? +
Goodnight. +
Goodnight. +
I hung up the phone, wondering... +
could I date a man who would never get married? +
Wow! A guy who doesn't want to get married! Film at 11:00! +
Don't tell me you're surprised by this. +
You know who wants to get married? +
Men who miss their mommies. +
Maybe this wasn't my target audience. +
Am I the only one who thinks this is a major bummer? +
What if you spend five years with him, +
and in the end, you have nothing to show for it? +
I wasn't even thinking about getting married +
until he told me I couldn't think about it. +
Now, it's all I can think about. +
Oh, just be cool. You don't care. +
Then, he'll wonder why you don't, +
which will make him realize that he does, +
and then it's a whole new ball game. +
So in your world, it's always sixth grade? +
I think that a relationship has to be based on +
honesty and communication +
if it has any chance of succeeding. +
Okay, if you were 25, that would be adorable, +
but you're 32 now, so that's just stupid. +
Well, I can't just ignore it, can I? +
Yes! -No. +
What's the big deal? +
In 50 years, men are gonna be obsolete anyway. +
I mean, already you can't talk to them. +
You don't need them to have kids with. +
You don't even need them to have sex with anymore, +
as I've just very pleasantly discovered. +
Uh-oh, sounds like somebody just got their first vibrator. +
Not first, ultimate. +
And I think I'm in love. +
-Oh, please... +
Stop! This is so sad! +
Come on, I'm not gonna replace a man +
-with some battery-operated device. Yes. you say that, +
but you haven't met "The Rabbit." +
Oh, come on. If you're going to get a vibrator, +
at least get one called "The Horse." +
A vibrator does not call you on your birthday. +
A vibrator doesn't send you flowers the next day. +
And you cannot take a vibrator home +
to meet your mother. +
Well, I know where my next orgasm is coming from. +
Who here can say as much? +
That night, Samantha went on a date +
with a flesh and blood man, +
while the three of us went in search of +
furrier companionship. +
Ladies, I'd like you to meet "The Rabbit." +
$92? +
Please! Think about the money we spend on shoes. +
Well, I have no intention of using that. +
I'm saving sex for someone I love. +
Fantastic, is there a man in the picture? +
Look! +
Oh, it's so cute. +
Oh, I thought it would be all scary and weird, but it isn't. +
It's-- it's pink for girls. +
And look, the little bunny, and his little face! +
Like Peter Rabbit. +
Yeah, and it's even got a remote. +
I mean, how lazy do you have to be? +
Later that night, back at the briar patch... +
Oh, wow. +
-Hello. +
You are not going to believe the evening I have had. +
Are you listening to me? +
Yeah. +
Jerry, who Samantha met at Brooke's wedding, +
took her to Lava, New York's restaurant du jour. +
From the moment I saw you at that wedding, +
I knew we'd be having dinner together. +
Well, aren't you cocky? +
I'm the kind of guy, I see something, +
I like it, +
I go after it. +
You sound like my kind of guy. +
Hold that thought. I'll be right back. +
Okay. +
Ten minutes and a couple of cocktails later... +
Where the hell is he? +
Excuse me. +
He obviously had seen something else he liked +
and gone after it. +
Then, just when she thought her evening +
couldn't get any worse... +
Samantha? Hey, Samantha! +
It's me. +
Bernie Turtletaub, from the wedding. +
Oh, right. +
Are you here all by yourself? +
Uh, well, sort of. I'm... +
Well, sit down. Join me! +
God, you look great. +
What Samantha needed now more than anything +
was a compliment from anyone. +
I can't believe the synchronicity. +
I was just thinking about you! +
Uh-huh. +
So... do you like this shirt? +
My ex-girlfriend picked it out for me. +
Honey, no offense, but you're breath... +
I know. +
It's these Chinese herbs I'm taking. +
You know, for longer life. +
Well, with breath like that +
you're gonna live a very long life, alone. +
I killed the last woman who talked to me like that. +
Samantha was impressed. +
The Turtle had attempted a joke. +
This is from Parma. +
You know, a lot of people can't tell the difference +
between prosciutto and bresaola. +
Once we get the breath under control, +
I'm going to take him shopping for a whole new wardrobe. +
He's a cute little fixer-upper. +
Sweetheart, he's a man, not a brownstone. +
Honey, when I'm through with him, +
he'll be Gracie Mansion! +
Samantha and The Turtle? +
But then again, I'm dating a man who will never get married, +
and Miranda is having a meaningful relationship +
with something that comes in a box from Japan. +
In a city of great expectations, +
is it time to settle for what you can get? +
I needed some answers. +
Later that week, I met Brooke. +
Just back from her honeymoon, she was all business. +
The business of marriage. +
Yes, I'd like to return these. +
Is there any way you can melt them down +
into one decent gift? +
His friends. +
So... how is it being married? +
Oh, it's fabulous. +
I feel like an enormous weight has been lifted. +
And that's a good thing. +
What's that supposed to mean? +
Oh, just, um... +
I mean, just means you're, you're-- +
I meant you're happy with Allen, right? +
Yes, I'm happy! +
Well, then, I'm happy for you. +
Hey, listen, um... +
I hope I didn't give you the wrong idea. +
I-- I think Allen's great. +
I just, I mean, he's incredibly successful-- +
Look, we all think we're Carolyn Bessette. +
One day John-John's out of the picture +
and we're happy just to have some guy +
who can throw around a Frisbee. +
Oh! Well, look who's here. Hey, you two! +
Hey! +
-Oh, my God! -What a small world! +
I couldn't believe it. +
It was The Turtle, wearing Helmut Lang. +
Wow, he looks great. +
Doesn't he? +
Oh. Oh. +
Oh, he twirls. +
What do you think? +
Fabulous. +
He's like a whole new person. +
-Don't I have a three o'clock? -Oh, that's right. +
I'm taking him to Bliss for a facial. +
-Oh, enjoy. -See you later. +
-Bye. -Bye. +
Oh, you know, I have to run too. +
-Oh. -I'll call you. +
Okay. +
Smart girl. She seems happy. +
Samantha left with The Turtle. +
Brooke left with a better gift. +
And I left wondering +
if everyone in Manhattan was settling. +
My Zen teacher once told me +
that there was nothing like yoga to quiet a busy mind. +
Just as I had reached the moment of no thought... +
I think I broke my vagina. +
Oh, Char, am I pulling too hard? +
No, metaphorically I mean, with the Rabbit. +
Oh, so you've been using it? +
Yes, and I'm scared if I keep using it, +
I'll never be able to enjoy sex with a man again. +
Why? +
Well, have you ever been with a man, +
you know, and he's, like, he's doing everything, and it feels good. +
But somehow you, you just can't manage to, um... +
-Cum? -Shh. Yeah. +
Well, it's weird, 'cause with the Rabbit, +
it's like every time, boom! +
And one time, I came for like, five minutes. +
Well, Charlotte, honey, it's not illegal. +
Yeah, but no man ever did that. +
I mean I'm scared. What am I gonna do? +
Well, you know, you could still enjoy sex with the man +
and the Rabbit. +
No, no, no, I am done with it. +
That's it. I am never gonna touch that thing again. +
Oh... +
Oh, um, uh, I've got to cancel on the ballet tonight. +
Oh. Why? +
Oh, I'm, uh, expecting a, uh, a phone call... +
a long-distance phone call. Transatlantic. +
Charlotte could never tell a decent lie. +
I knew an addict when I saw one. +
Oh, God I love Sleeping Beauty ! +
The music, the sets, the costumes! +
It's so romantic! +
You only like it because she gets to sleep +
for 100 years and she doesn't age. +
I invited Stanford to the ballet. +
I knew he was available. +
Hey, Stanford, cute, huh? +
I've had it with the whole gay scene. +
It's so competitive. +
You won't believe what happened to me last week. +
Evidently, Stanford, tired of bars and blind dates, +
decided to place a personal ad. +
He scheduled a rendezvous with the only respondent +
on a cold, Sunday afternoon. +
Twenty minutes and three false alarms later, +
Stanford was ready to call it quits. +
Stanford? +
Yes. +
Sorry, this is not gonna happen. +
It's so brutal out there. +
Even guys like me don't want guys like me. +
I just don't have that gay look. +
I don't know, you look pretty gay to me. +
Come on, maybe it's just a phase. +
Puberty is a phase. +
Fifteen years of rejection is a lifestyle. +
I mean, sometimes I think I should just marry a woman +
and get all the money. +
What, is there a cash prize? +
Oh, yeah. My grandmother gives everyone in the family +
their inheritance when they get married. +
She doesn't know you're gay? +
She doesn't believe in gay. +
Oh, really? That's funny. +
Big doesn't believe in marriage. +
Maybe you should propose to me, +
and we'll all live happily ever after. +
You really do want it all. +
I don't know. Maybe nobody gets it all. +
Though, you do have a point. +
We're best friends. +
We make each other laugh. +
We both sleep with men! +
You know, this is not a bad idea at all. +
Well, actually, I was kidding. +
I'm not! Think about it. +
Who else will keep you in expensive shoes +
and encourage you to cheat? +
Now you're talking! +
Friday night at the ballet +
with a man who shared my passion for hot men in tights. +
Saturday afternoon in bed with a man +
who shared my passion for passion. +
Maybe there was such a thing as having it all. +
What's that smile about? +
Oh, I got a marriage proposal last night. +
Really? +
-Mm. -From whom? +
A very handsome, witty, young man +
about to come into his inheritance. +
Oh, I see. +
Anyone I know? +
Actually his name is Stanford, +
Stanford Blatch. +
I thought he was gay. +
He is. +
That should make for an interesting column. +
What are you going to do about sex? +
I have you. +
Oh. +
I guess you've got it all figured out, +
Mrs. Blatch. +
The more he mocked me, +
the more convinced I became +
that this idea was genius. +
That night, Miranda and I had plans +
to join Charlotte for a gallery opening +
in Chelsea when-- +
-Hello. Carrie, it's Charlotte. +
Oh, I'm really sorry, but I'm gonna have to cancel. +
Yeah, I'm totally wiped out. +
Uh-huh. +
Wiped out. +
That was "Charlotte speak" for +
"I'm spending the night with my vibrator." +
But you guys have fun, though. +
There was only one thing to do. +
A Rabbit intervention. +
Come on, let's go. +
Okay, where is it? +
What are you talking about? +
The Rabbit, Charlotte, give us the Rabbit. +
Hey, hey, hey, it's a vibrator! +
It's not like it's crack. +
No! +
Oh, Charlotte, you hid the Rabbit +
behind a stuffed rabbit? +
That is so you. +
You guys have a lot of nerve coming in here. +
You're the one who made me get it. +
I thought you could handle it. +
It's no big deal. +
I'd just rather stay home with the Rabbit +
than go out and deal with men. +
All right. You're right. +
I'll go get dressed. +
With a little help from her friends, +
Charlotte decided that +
she wasn't going to settle for herself. +
While Samantha was doing everything in her power +
to remake The Turtle +
into a man she could fall in love with. +
How's your dinner? +
It's questionable. +
I can't figure out whether the mushrooms in this sauce +
are shiitake or chanterelle. +
They're definitely not porcini. +
Maybe they're wood ear. +
Maybe it doesn't matter. +
My God, they're trompettes! +
It was then that Samantha realized +
that even with all her effort, +
he was still just The Turtle in black. +
You know... I'm not feeling very well. +
I think I'm going to have to send myself home. +
I'll call you. +
Excuse me. +
Do you like this shirt? +
My ex-girlfriend picked it out. +
After 12 phone calls and three e-mails, +
Stanford badgered me into at least meeting his grandmother. +
I love that suit you're wearing. +
Designed by Coco Chanel herself. +
Seriously? +
Oh, Grandmother's been wearing that same suit +
for 40 years. +
And it still fits. +
-It never goes out of style. -Never. +
I have it in blue, black, pink. +
And eggshell! +
Exactly. +
Stanford tells me you're a writer. +
Yes, I have a column in The Star . +
I was a career woman many, many years ago. +
But I gave it up to have children. +
Oh, wow! +
Is this you? +
Not a bad looking girl. Don't you think? +
No. +
Doesn't she look exactly like Deborah Kerr +
in An Affair to Remember ? +
She does. +
Oh, my God! +
This has to be Stanford. +
-You're the same person! -Okay, that's enough. +
Oh, come on, this is fun. +
I had no idea you had such a big family. +
And how about you, honey? +
Do you want a family? +
As I looked around at all the memorabilia +
and family photographs, +
the faces of brides and grooms, +
children and grandchildren, +
I realized... +
-Yes, I do. +
Uh, Stanny, be a dear. +
Go in the kitchen and get me some matches. +
Of course. +
I love my Stanford. +
He's a very sweet boy. +
But you know, he is a fruit. +
I realized then that the only inheritance Stanford was going to get +
from his grandmother was her collection of Chanel suits. +
Salt... yeah. +
That night at dinner, I knew I would have to break the news to Mr. Big. +
What do you think? +
Look, I do want to get married someday. +
I mean, maybe not today, but I just-- I don't want to-- +
I can't date somebody that won't. +
You know, what's the point? +
Definitely too much salt. +
I mean, it's all in the timing. +
You gotta brown the garlic +
before you put in the onions. +
Know what I mean? +
I thought we were having fun. +
It's bitter, +
but definitely has possibilities. +
You got a little bit of sauce on the lip right... +
there. +
My Zen teacher also said +
the only way to true happiness +
is to live in the moment +
and not worry about the future. +
Of course, he died penniless and single. +
\N“龟兔赛跑” +
\N在这个充满理想人物的城市里 +
\N不会有人过得比布鲁克更完美 +
\N她是个室内设计师 约会通常只有固定的阶层 +
\N对她而言周六的夜晚 就像是高中舞会 +
\N因此当她结婚时我们都急着 看看是谁有这个能耐 +
\N难道只有我记得她曾说过 这个男人 +
\N无聊得像块砖头吗 +
\N这是个花费约十万美金的 普通婚礼 +
\N来的有女人讨厌的银行投资客 +
\N还有斯坦纳高中的同学 戴尔顿和布朗 +
\N再来是我们 +
\N我们看起来真像四个老巫婆 +
\N这种规模的婚礼都会留两桌 给单身者认识的机会 +
\N我们坐的是另外一桌 +
\N你好 +
\N你好﹐我叫柏尼托德陶 是新郎的朋友 +
\N那只乌龟也来了 他是曼哈顿的传奇 +
\N以精准的投资和口臭闻名 +
\N我的脚快痛死了 +
\N-快来坐下吧 -不﹐这衣服只有站着还能看 +
\N我倒觉得换个方式看也不错 +
\N我的桌子在那边 +
\N你的朋友真美 +
\N我要怎么做 才能进一步认识她？ +
\N你想这个水果蛋糕里放的 是波斯克梨还是巴特利梨？ +
\N谁会管这些啊？ +
\N两小时后我们都觉得无聊透顶 +
\N-菜也越上越少 -我们的一位船友甚至跳船了 +
\N我们要不要过去抢捧花？ +
\N我们不可能结婚的 +
\N这一定是波斯克梨 +
\N你们相信我还是结婚了吗 +
\N你是下一个 比尔有几个单身的朋友很不错 +
\N嫁个爱你的人 比嫁个你爱的人要好多了 +
\N大家总爱说些我不想听的话 +
\N但这次也实在太过分了 +
\N-我把你吵醒了吗 -没有 +
\N我问你﹐两个人既然不相爱 为何要结婚？ +
\N不知道 也许是需要伴侣﹑内疚 +
\N或想寻求政治庇护吧 +
\N那你为何结婚？ +
\N-我以前是恋爱中的傻子 -说得真好听 +
\N-后来成了离婚法庭里的傻子 -现在只是个傻子 +
\N完全正确 所以我绝对不会再婚 +
\N忽然间我开始全神贯注 听他的呼吸 +
\N-你的床上还有人吗 -没有﹐你有吗 +
\N只有三块结婚蛋糕 你会吃醋吗 +
\N视情况决定 你打算怎么处理那些糖霜？ +
\N-晚安 -晚安 +
\N挂上电话之后我就想… 我要和一个不婚的男人交往吗 +
\N一个不婚的男人 这简直是午夜级的电影嘛 +
\N-别告诉我你听了很惊讶 -你认识想结婚的男人吗 +
\N-我只认识会想老妈的男人 -看来她们不是我倾吐的对象 +
\N也许只有我讨厌结婚这件事吧 +
\N要是你和他在一起五年 了无新意了怎么办？ +
\N在他说这话之前我没想过婚姻 +
\N-现在却满脑子都是这件事 -冷静点﹐你根本不在乎婚姻 +
\N他以后会纳闷你怎么不在乎 而他竟然比你还在乎 +
\N你们就可以重新比过了 +
\N你一直搞这种六年级的把戏吗 +
\N我认为婚姻关系必须建立在 +
\N互信和沟通上 +
\N若你还25岁这个想法是很可爱 但32岁还这么想就太蠢了 +
\N我总不能对男人视而不见吧？ +
\N这有什么大不了的？ 50年后男人就过时了 +
\N你不能跟他们聊天 也不需要他们来生孩子 +
\N甚至不需要找他们燕好 这是我的最新发现 +
\N看来有人买了第一支按摩棒 +
\N不是第一支﹐是最后一支 我觉得我爱上它了 +
\N别说了﹐这也太悲哀了吧 +
\N我才不会用装了电池的器材 来取代男人 +
\N那是因为你没看过“兔子” +
\N拜托﹐你既然要买个按摩棒 至少挑个叫“种马”的牌子吧 +
\N按摩棒不会在生日上门找你 +
\N也不会送你花 你总不能带它回家见你妈吧？ +
\N我知道我的高潮点在哪里 +
\N你们有谁知道吗 +
\N那天晚上莎曼珊与一个 活生生的男人出去约会 +
\N我们三个却跑去找另一种 伴侣关系 +
\N两位﹐这就是“兔子” +
\N美金92元？ +
\N拜托 我们都花多少钱买鞋子啊 +
\N我才不用这种东西 我要把性爱留给我爱的男人 +
\N好极了﹐你有这号人物吗 +
\N你们看﹐它好可爱 +
\N我还以为它一定会很古怪吓人 这是专为女人设计的粉红色 +
\N这只兔子还有张彼得兔的脸 +
\N这里还有个遥控器 你想多懒就可以多懒 +
\N那天晚上当我回到家后… +
\N喔 +
\N哪位？ +
\N你绝对不信我今晚的遭遇 +
\N-你有听我说话吗 -有啊 +
\N莎曼珊在布鲁克的婚礼上 认识了杰瑞 +
\N他带她到纽约的熔岩法国餐厅 +
\N当我在婚礼看到你时 +
\N我就知道我们会一起晚餐 +
\N你也太自信了吧？ +
\N我对这种事的直觉向来很准 +
\N只要我喜欢就会急起直追 +
\N我喜欢你这种人 +
\N-保持这种想法﹐我马上回来 -好 +
\N十分钟后莎曼珊已喝了 几杯鸡尾酒 +
\N他上哪儿去了？ +
\N借过 +
\N他显然找到了急起直追的对象 +
\N正当她认为这个晚上的情况 不可能再糟的时候 +
\N莎曼珊 +
\N是我﹐柏尼托德陶 我们在婚礼上见过 +
\N-没错 -你是自己来的吗 +
\N-可以这么说﹐我是… -快来陪我坐吧 +
\N天啊﹐你真美 +
\N莎曼珊现在正需要 任何一个人的恭维 +
\N怎么会这么巧？我正在想你 +
\N你喜欢这件衬衫吗 这是我的前女友帮我选的 +
\N我无意冒犯﹐但是你的口气… +
\N我知道﹐我有吃一种中药 吃了可以长寿 +
\N有你这种口气绝对可以 孤独地活得很久 +
\N上一个对我说这种话的女人 已经被我杀了 +
\N莎曼珊大感意外 这只乌龟竟然还懂得幽默 +
\N等我习惯他的口臭之后 我就带他一起去逛街 +
\N他还挺有可塑性的 +
\N拜托﹐他是个男人 不是建筑砂石 +
\N等我和他交往之后 他就会变成格雷西大厦 +
\N莎曼珊和乌龟交往？ +
\N我在跟一个不婚的男人来往 +
\N米兰达则是和一个 来自日本的机器难分难舍 +
\N在这个充满期待的城市里 是否该厘清自己能掌握什么呢 +
\N我需要答案 几天后我遇到了布鲁克 +
\N她刚度完蜜月回来 但这场蜜月却有如一笔生意 +
\N我想退还这些东西 +
\N能不能用它们换个 好一点的礼物？ +
\N是他的朋友送的 +
\N你的婚后生活如何？ +
\N好极了 就好像重了好几公斤 +
\N-这是好事吗 -你这话是什么意思？ +
\N我只是想问你和艾伦快乐吗 +
\N-我很快乐 -那我也为你高兴 +
\N我希望这话不会误导你 +
\N我认为艾伦很不错﹐只是… 他的事业非常成功 +
\N我们都认为我们是卡洛琳巴塞 +
\N哪天我们却会很高兴遇到一个 会丢飞盘的人 +
\N-你看那是谁？你们好 -这个世界真小 +
\N我真不敢相信 乌龟竟然穿起了苏格兰裙 +
\N-他这身行头真帅 -是吗 +
\N-他竟然在秀他的衣服 -还不错吧？ +
\N-太棒了 -他就像脱胎换骨了一样 +
\N-我三点是不是还有事？ -对了﹐我要带他做脸部按摩 +
\N-回头见 -再见 +
\N-我也得走了﹐我再打给你 -好 +
\N她很聪明﹐她看起来很快乐 +
\N莎曼珊和乌龟一起离开 布鲁克也带着新的礼物走了 +
\N我却在想曼哈顿的人 是否都定下来了 +
\N我坐褝的师父告诉我瑜珈 最能平静骚动的心 +
\N正当我到达放空的境界时… +
\N-我的阴道破了 -我拉得太用力了吗 +
\N我只是打个比方 我指的是“兔子” +
\N你已经开始用了？ +
\N没错﹐我怕要是继续用下去 以后就无法和男人燕好 +
\N为什么？ +
\N你是否曾遇过一个 对你体贴入微的男人 +
\N你和他在一起感觉很棒 但你却没办法… +
\N-高潮？ -对 +
\N可是我和兔子就不同 我每次都能高潮 +
\N有一次我还来了五分钟 +
\N夏绿蒂﹐这又不犯法 +
\N没有男人做得到 我好怕﹐我该怎么办？ +
\N你还是可以找男人和兔子 享受鱼水之欢 +
\N没办法﹐我已经用过了 以后我绝不再碰那玩意 +
\N我今晚不能去看芭蕾舞剧了 +
\N-为什么？ -因为我在等… +
\N一通大西洋彼岸的长途电话 +
\N夏绿蒂永远不擅长说谎 有人上瘾绝逃不过我的法眼 +
\N天啊﹐我好爱睡美人 它的音乐﹑场景﹑服装… +
\N都浪漫极了 +
\N这是因为她睡了100年 却一点也不老 +
\N当晚我请史丹佛去看芭蕾舞剧 因为我知道他有空 +
\N史丹佛﹐他们很可爱对吧？ +
\N我真不想看到别的男同志 +
\N太竞争了 你绝不相信我上星期的遭遇 +
\N他显然厌倦了酒吧和盲目约会 +
\N才决定刊登广告 +
\N他和唯一回覆的人约好 +
\N在寒冷的周日午后见面 +
\N20分钟内他表错了三次情 +
\N于是他便宣告放弃 +
\N-史丹佛？ -我是 +
\N抱歉﹐我们不可能有发展的 +
\N外面的世界太残酷了 +
\N连长相和我相当的都看不上我 我的样子根本不适合当同性恋 +
\N这倒不尽然 我就觉得你挺帅的 +
\N-也许你只是时运不济 -青春期只有一个阶段 +
\N15年饱受拒绝 会成为一种行为模式 +
\N我有时会想干脆娶个女人 拿了钱就算了 +
\N有人用钱奖励你结婚吗 +
\N没错﹐我奶奶会在每个子孙 +
\N婚后分他一份遗产 +
\N-她不知道你是同性恋？ -她不相信有同性恋 +
\N是吗？大人物也不相信婚姻 +
\N也许你应该向我求婚 我们就能快乐的过日子了 +
\N你还真是贪心 +
\N也许没有人能样样兼得吧 +
\N不过你说的有道理 +
\N我们是好朋友 又能逗彼此开心 +
\N-我们都和男人睡觉 -这个主意真的不赖 +
\N-我是开玩笑的 -我可不是﹐你想想看 +
\N谁能供你买昂贵的皮鞋 又鼓励你欺骗他？ +
\N有道理 +
\N周五晚上我和一个男人分享 我的情欲和紧身裤的芭蕾舞者 +
\N周末下午却与一个男人 分享我的热情 +
\N也许世上真有样样兼得的好事 +
\N你在笑什么？ +
\N昨晚有人向我求婚 +
\N真的？是谁？ +
\N一个英俊诙谐 又将继承一笔遗产的年轻人 +
\N原来如此﹐我认识他吗 +
\N他叫史丹佛﹐史丹佛巴勒奇 +
\N-他不是男同性恋吗 -没错 +
\N这下你的专栏又有主题可写了 +
\N你打算怎么解决性的问题？ +
\N我有你啊 +
\N看来你都计划好了 巴勒奇太太 +
\N他越是嘲笑我 +
\N就越让我觉得这方法可行 +
\N当晚我和米兰达决定和夏绿蒂 参加一个画廊的开幕酒会 +
\N-哪位？ -凯莉﹐是我夏绿蒂 +
\N抱歉﹐我得取消今晚的约会 +
\N我被彻底摧毁了 +
\N摧毁？这是夏绿蒂的说法 +
\N意思就是 “我要和我的按摩棒共度今晚” +
\N祝你们玩得愉快 +
\N现在只有一个办法 就是阻止那只兔子 +
\N该出发了 +
\N它在哪里？ +
\N-你在说什么？ -把兔子交出来﹐夏绿蒂 +
\N拜托﹐那只是个按摩棒 又不是古柯碱 +
\N夏绿蒂 你竟然把它藏在兔娃娃后面 +
\N你太夸张了 +
\N你们竟然还敢闯进来 这可是你劝我买的 +
\N我以为你能处理得很好啊 +
\N这又没什么﹐我只是想留在家 省得出去应付男人嘛 +
\N好吧﹐你们说得对 我去换衣服 +
\N藉由我们这帮好友的帮助 +
\N她终于决定不自己解决需要 +
\N莎曼珊用尽一切方法 +
\N将乌龟改造成她会喜欢的典型 +
\N-晚餐还可口吗 -好奇怪 +
\N我吃不出这是松菇 还是酒杯蘑菇 +
\N绝对不是猪菇 +
\N或许是木耳 +
\N或许没那么重要吧 +
\N天啊﹐这是喇叭菇 +
\N这时候莎曼珊才了解到 即使她费尽心机 +
\N他仍然是个无可救药的乌龟 +
\N我突然觉得不太舒服 我还是先回家好了 +
\N我再打电话给你 +
\N小姐﹐你喜欢这件衬衫吗 +
\N是我的前女友为我挑选的 +
\N在通过12通电话 和三封电子邮件之后 +
\N史丹佛缠着我一定要 见他的奶奶 +
\N-我好喜欢你这身套装 -这是香奈儿亲手设计的 +
\N-真的吗 -奶奶这件套装买了40年了 +
\N现在还是很合时宜 从来没过时 +
\N我有蓝﹑黑﹑粉红… +
\N-还有乳白色的 -没错 +
\N-史丹佛说你是个作家 -对﹐我为星辰日报写专栏 +
\N多年前我也是个职业妇女 +
\N后来为了生孩子放弃了 +
\N这是你吗 +
\N-长得还不错吧？ -当然 +
\N她是不是很像北非谍影里的 黛博拉卡尔？ +
\N没错 +
\N我的天﹐这一定是史丹佛吧 你一点都没变 +
\N-够了 -有什么关系嘛 +
\N我从不知道你有个大家族 +
\N你呢？你想要一个家庭吗 +
\N当我看着那些家族的纪念照 +
\N新郎﹑新娘﹑子子孙孙时 +
\N我突然了解到… +
\N我愿意 +
\N史丹佛﹐乖孙子 到厨房去帮我拿几根火柴来 +
\N好 +
\N我很爱史丹佛﹐他是个好孩子 但他却是个男同性恋者 +
\N这时我才了解到史丹佛 能从他奶奶那里继承的… +
\N是她的香奈儿套装 +
\N盐巴 +
\N那天晚餐时 我知道我得向大人物坦白 +
\N-怎么样？ -我总有一天要结婚的 +
\N或许不是今天﹐但是… 我不能和一个不婚的男人交往 +
\N盐加得太多了 +
\N时间的拿捏很重要 +
\N大蒜得煮烂再把洋葱丢下去 你懂我的意思吗 +
\N我觉得我们处得很愉快 +
\N好多了 不过还有改善的空间 +
\N你的嘴唇上沾了点酱汁 +
\N我坐褝的师父曾经说过 想得到真正的幸福 +
\N只有活在当下﹐别去想未来 +
\N后来他死的时候既未结婚 又身无分文 +
