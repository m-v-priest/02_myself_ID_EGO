Last night, my friend Miranda got invited 被邀请 to a dinner party by a man she hardly 几乎不，几乎没有；刚刚，才 knew. +
She was the date 约会对象 of Nick Waxler,
a fairly successful sports agent 体育经纪人
who once told her she had nice legs. +

[.my2]
她当时跟尼克瓦克勒约会 他是个成功的运动经纪人 +
还曾说过她有双漂亮的腿

Okay,
old _movie stars_ you'd have liked to fuck
when they were young. +
Alive or dead? +
It doesn't matter, I'll start. +
Veronica Lake,
the year she made Sullivan's Travels . //她拍“苏利文游记”时 +
Dave? +
Huh. I'd have to say Sophia Loren. +
Probably 'cause my dad *had this thing for* 对...有好感、有意思 her. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.have a thing for someone
当别人跟你说 I have a thing for you，可不是有东西要给你，而是“对你有好感、有意思”，相当于I like you，指还没确定恋情的阶段。


如果“对某事有强烈的喜欢或讨厌”，可以用 Have a thing about sth。

.HAVE A ˈTHING ABOUT SB/STH
( informal ) to have a strong like or dislike of sb/sth in a way that seems strange or unreasonable （莫名其妙地）对…有好感，对…有偏见 +
•She has a thing about men with beards. 她对留胡子的男人有强烈的感觉。
====

-Uh, we won't go there. +
Montgomery Clift. +
He was gay. +
Oh. +
Marilyn Monroe, +
before the Kennedys got to her. Honey? +
-Bing Crosby. +
Ah! I stand by my choice. 我坚持我的选择。 +
Sean Connery, +
yesterday, today, and tomorrow. +
For a first date, Miranda felt like _she was hitting it out of the ballpark_ 棒球场；活动领域. +
Thanks. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.You hit it out of the ballpark.  你工作表现很棒
the ballpark 源自棒球术语，意思是“将球击出场外(全垒打)”，引申为“非常成功”。 +
- She’s quite sure she hit that driving test out of the ballpark. 她很确信她在驾驶考试中表现很棒。
====

So how long have you known Nick? +
We've been riding the same elevator line for years +
and then we had lunch 吃午餐 a few weeks ago +
and then he invited me here to dinner. +
Well, we adore 热爱，爱慕（某人） him. +
He's very smart. +
I guess he *took* our little ultimatum 最后通牒 *seriously*. +

[.my2]
我猜他把我们的最后通牒当真了。

Deanne. +
What are you talking about? +
They told Miranda +
that Nick *had this thing for* models. //尼克偏好模特儿 +
Okay, old movie stars +
you would have liked to fuck when they were young. +
I'll start. +
Veronica Lake, +
the year she made Sullivan's Travels . +
Dave? +
I'd have to go with Sophia Loren. +
Probably, my dad *had a thing for* her. +
Montgomery Clift. +
Marilyn Monroe. +
Bing Crosby. +
Yvette? +
Um, I don't know, Charlie Sheen? +
They'd come to dinner, push their food around, +
and pout (v.)撅嘴. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
“push their food around” 是指用餐时用餐具随意拨弄食物，而不是认真地吃。这通常表示对食物或整个用餐过程缺乏兴趣或不满。
====

Veronica Lake. +
Sophia Loren. +
Montgomery Clift. +
Marilyn Monroe. +
Bing Crosby. +
Marissa? +
She, um... +
had to make a phone call. +
It got to be a problem. +
They decided to take action. +

Can't you find a woman +
who can carry on 继续做；坚持干 a decent conversation （非正式的）谈话，交谈? +
Yeah, Nick. And eat without purging 清除，清洗（组织中的异己分子）. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
“eat without purging” 是指吃完东西后不进行催吐。这里的 “purging” 是指一种饮食失调行为，即通过自我催吐来清除体内食物。
====

-What are you saying? +
You can't bring around any more of these so-called models, Nick. +
Uh-uh, it's too depressing 令人沮丧的. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
“Bring around” 是带来或带到某个地方。
====

Okay, okay. +
I'll see what I can do. +
And then he brought you. +
So obviously not a model. +
In a good way! +
Nick dates (v.) models? +
Miranda confronted him, +
and it didn't take him long to fold (v.)认输;折叠，对折（纸、织物等）. +
Well, it's true. It's true, okay? +
I'm obsessed (a.)（对……）着迷的，（受……）困扰的. +
Obsessed (a.) with models. +
-Correct. -So what am I? +
Your intellectual beard for the evening? +
Look, don't be pissed (a.)烂醉的；醉醺醺的, all right? +
You got to admit, you met some nice people. +
All right, you had a good time. +
You were on a date with a modelizer +
and you didn't even know it? +
If men like Nick are dating models, +
what chance do ordinary women have? +
I mean, do you have to be a supermodel to get a date in New York? +
Modelizers are a particular breed. +
They're a step beyond womanizers +
who will sleep with just about anything in a skirt. +
Modelizers are obsessed, +
not with women, but with models, +
who, in most cities, are safely confined to billboards and magazines, +
but in Manhattan, actually run wild on the streets, +
turning the city into a virtual model country safari, +
where men can pet the creatures in their natural habitat. +
As if we didn't have enough problems. +
They're stupid and lazy +
and they should be shot on sight. +
I've been out with a lot of guys +
and they say I am just as beautiful as a model, +
but I work for a living. I mean, I'm like, well, +
I'm like a model who's taken the high road. +
The advantages given to models +
and to beautiful women in general +
are so unfair, it makes me want to puke. +
Sweetheart, you shouldn't say that, you are so cute. +
Cute doesn't cut it in this town. +
What's cute compared to supermodel? +
There's nothing like raising the subject of models +
among four single women +
to spice up an otherwise dull Tuesday night. +
They have this distant, sexy look. +
That's not sexy, it's starvation. +
That's starvation in the best restaurants. +
Yeah. What I want to know is, +
when did all the men get together and decide +
that they would only get it up for giraffes with big breasts? +
In some cultures, heavy women with mustaches +
are considered beautiful. +
And you're looking at me while you're saying that? +
We should just admit that we live in a culture +
that promotes impossible standards of beauty. +
Yeah, except men think they're possible. +
-Yeah. -I just know no matter how good I feel about myself, +
if I see Christy Turlington, I just want to give up. +
I just want to tie her down and force feed her lard, +
but that's the difference between you and me. +
What are you talking about? +
Look at you two, you're beautiful. +
I hate my thighs. +
Oh, come on! +
I can't even open a magazine +
without thinking, "thighs, thighs, thighs." +
Well, I'll take your thighs and raise you a chin. +
I'll take your chin and raise you a... +
-What? -Oh, come on. +
Hey, I happen to love the way I look. +
You should, you paid enough for it. +
Hey, I resent that. +
I do not believe in plastic surgery. +
Well, not yet. +
I find it fascinating that four, +
beautiful, flesh and blood women +
could be intimidated by some unreal fantasy. +
I mean look. Look at this. +
Is this really intimidating to any of you? +
I hate my thighs. +
-Pass the chicken. -You know, I have that dress. +
Suddenly, I was interested. +
If models could cause otherwise rational individuals +
to crumble in their presence, +
exactly how powerful was beauty? +
There are two types of guys that fall for beautiful women. +
Either they're slimeballs that are just out to get laid, +
or they fall in love with you instantly. +
It's pathetic. +
Why fuck the girl in the skirt, +
if you can fuck the girl in the ad for the skirt? +
Being beautiful is such a power. +
You can get whatever you want. +
You can get anything. +
I've been offered trips to Aspen, +
weekends in Paris, +
Christmas in St. Barts. +
A motorcycle, +
juicer. +
It's not like models don't have brains. +
They have them. +
They just don't need to use them. +
Most guys just think you're dumb, +
but I'm really very literary. +
I read. +
I'll sit down and I'll read a whole magazine +
from cover to cover. +
Some scuba gear. +
A Herb Ritts photo. +
A Bvlgari necklace. A breast job. +
My friends think I'm shallow. +
Sometimes I think they're right. +
Other times, I think, +
"Hey, I'm fucking a model." +
Models are a lot looser than you think. +
It's way easier to screw a model than a regular girl +
'cause that's what they do all the time. +
It's how regular people are when they're on vacation. +
Barkley, a notorious modelizer, +
was one of those SoHo wonders +
who maintained a fabulous lifestyle, +
despite never having sold a single painting. +
So you're saying it's easy to meet them? +
No, it's not so easy. +
The trick is, you gotta treat them like they're regular girls. +
You gotta be able to roll into a place, +
walk up to the hottest thing there. +
Otherwise, you're finished. +
It's kind of like being around dogs. +
You gotta show no fear. +
Things? +
You call them things? +
Yeah. +
Well, they are things. +
They're beautiful things, +
and that's what my life's about, you know? +
Beauty. +
Come here, I want to show you something. +
This is my real art, +
only I can't really show it to the public. +
Well, not yet at least. +
Sit down. +
That's Vanessa. +
That's Tanya, +
Elana, +
Katrina. +
I couldn't believe it. +
The man had slept with half the perfume ads +
in September's Vogue . +
Do they-- +
do they know about this? +
Maybe. +
Oh, look at that one. +
She does runway now, +
but I think she's gonna be huge someday. +
I didn't know what to say. +
There really wasn't anything to say except... +
Do you have a light? +
Yeah, sure. +
Later that day, I was relieved to discover +
that at least one eligible bachelor +
got his kicks off the runway. +
So I totally dig your friend, Miranda. +
You're kidding. That's great! +
Yeah, I think she is so sexy and smart, +
and did she tell you that we made out? +
No. +
Yeah, it was totally hot. +
Wow. So why don't you call her? You should call her. +
-She would love that. -I did, like 100 times. +
She totally won't return my phone calls. +
I don't know. Did she say anything about me? +
No. +
I don't know, maybe she's just busy, +
or I don't know, am I not cute enough for her? +
Of course, you are. Skipper, you're adorable. +
Well, I don't know. Find out for me. +
I want to see if I still have a chance. +
Right now, in front of you? +
Go ahead. I can handle it. +
Hi, this is Miranda. Please leave me a message. +
Oh, it's her machine. +
Hey, this is Skipper. +
I'm in the street with Carrie. +
I just told her how you won't call me back. +
So now you have to call me back. +
You better call me back! +
No, I'm kidding. I'm joking. +
Um, but seriously, I hope you call me back, +
and, um, did I mention this was Skipper? +
I believe there is a curse put on the head +
of anybody who tries to fix up their friends. +
Where better to find modelizers in their natural habitat +
than a fashion show? +
Luckily, my friend Stanford Blatch +
had a client in the hottest show in town. +
"The Bone" is like the human equivalent of the sable coat. +
He's so beautiful that I find that sometimes +
I have to look away. +
Do you see him? +
Right over there. +
-Where? -Oh, my God, look at him. +
It's like he travels with his own personal lighting director. +
Derek, a.k.a. "The Bone," +
was the world's biggest underwear model +
and Stanford's most important client, +
as well as the subject of his single-minded obsession. +
Hey, Stanny. +
Um, Derek, I would like you to meet a very dear friend, +
Carrie Bradshaw. +
-Hi. -Hi. +
Nice to meet you. +
Carrie writes the column "Sex in the City." +
Wow, that's great. +
-Oh, have you read it? -Uh, no. +
You know, the other day, Derek and I were walking past his billboard, +
and he told me he'd like to get a piece of it +
for his apartment, like maybe his nose. +
And I said, "You should get the bulge in your pants, +
that way, when woman ask how big you are, +
you can say, '14 feet.'" +
That would be very funny, wouldn't it? +
Yeah. Yeah. +
Everybody's talking about you. +
You are so great. +
You're gonna be a star, have I told you that enough times? +
You're a star, you're a star, you're a star. +
Well, we better let you get dressed. +
I am dressed. +
Oh. +
We'll, uh, see you after the show. +
Bye. +
Okay, bye. +
Can you believe anyone that beautiful can be that nice? +
I keep dreaming that someday he's just gonna turn around and say, +
"Stanford, I love you." +
Is he gay? +
He denies it. +
How can anyone that gorgeous be straight? +
Sweetie, over here! +
Samantha Jones never missed a major fashion show. +
She was one of the only people I knew +
who thought that proximity to beauty +
made her feel more attractive. +
Hey, sweetie, so wait, what happened? +
You couldn't find seats right on the runway? +
Oh, you can see all the flaws from this angle. +
Hey, Carrie. +
Hey! Hi, Barkley, how are you? +
You going to the party afterwards? +
Um, I don't know. +
Of course we are. +
Hi, I'm Samantha. +
Barkley. +
Martini straight up or with a twist? +
Straight up. +
Really? He's very cute. +
You're not dating him, are you? +
Oh, God, no, he's a total modelizer. +
Is he, uh, dating any one model in particular? +
Actually, he's sleeping with all of them in general. +
Only models? +
Only models. +
Later that night, we all went downtown for a party. +
I was beginning to float away on a sea of sweet potato puffs +
with smoked salmon and sour cream when... +
It was Mr. Big, +
major tycoon, major dream boat, +
and majorly out of my league. +
I thought I saw you on the runway. +
Oh, hi. +
I started reading your column after we met. +
You did? +
Yeah, cute. +
"Cute." +
Well... +
Yeah, cute. +
What are you writing about this week? +
Um, well, I'm working on a story about... +
men who date models. +
Any thoughts? +
Only that they're very lucky. +
So what have you discovered about these men +
who are dating models? +
Well, I'm discovering +
that some of them treat it as a competitive sport, +
and others I think just need the validation. +
And probably others just have a thing +
for exceptionally beautiful women. +
Exactly. +
And there's something wrong with that? +
No, there's nothing wrong. +
I just think it might become a bit monotonous. +
Puff? +
Um, no, thanks. +
Oh! Excuse me, baby. +
So where do you, uh, write these stories? +
My cute stories? +
Yeah, I mean have you got an office or anything? +
No. Well, about half the time I'm at my apartment, +
and the other half I'm over at this coffee shop +
on 73rd and Madison. +
Oh, uh, Carrie, I'd like you to meet Misha. +
Oh, hi. +
You were great in the show. +
Thank you. +
Suddenly, I felt like I was wearing patchouli +
in a room full of Chanel. +
Well, it was nice talking to you. +
Oh, see you around sometime... +
I hope. +
The truth was, I thought I had come to terms with my looks +
the year I turned 30, +
when I realized that I no longer had the energy +
to be completely superficial. +
Your friend Barkley, +
he's really been coming on to me. +
Do you actually think he believes I'm a model? +
Well, whatever it is, you don't want to go there. +
Why not? +
He has this thing for secretly taping his conquests. +
-Really? -Mm-hmm. +
What a pervert. +
As Samantha began to get ready for her close-up, +
I felt it was time to call it a night. +
I had never felt so invisible in my entire life. +
Taxi! +
Carrie. +
Hey! Hi! +
Did, um, did Stanford leave? +
No, he's in there giving a neck massage to a Versace model. +
Oh. +
So where are you going now? +
Oh, I'm going home. +
Can I come? +
You want to come home with me? +
Sure, if it's quiet. +
I can't take these crowds. +
The things you gotta do in the name of research. +
Shouldn't you be spending the night +
with some girl from the show? +
No, I never date models. +
I think they're stupid. +
I wondered if there wasn't some kind of physics for beauty. +
Maybe two models repelled, +
Maybe models could only be attracted to ordinary humans. +
So, I think it's so cool that you write. +
Thanks. +
I wish I could write. +
I got all these intense thoughts, +
but I can't keep them in my head long enough +
to get them down on paper. +
Well, that's the big trick. +
The truth is, I'm totally neurotic. +
One minute, I can be walking down the street, totally cool, +
and the next minute I'm depressed for no reason. +
I'm totally self-conscious. +
Like before I say something, I say it in my head first +
so it doesn't come out wrong. +
Doesn't that seem like a waste of time? +
It only takes a second. +
And sometimes I get so distracted. +
What's distracting you now? +
Your nose. +
Thanks a lot. +
-I hate my nose. -No, it's just so cute. +
I hate my nose, too. +
It's too big, but I think it depends on my hair. +
Yeah... +
I see what you mean. +
So what do you want to be when you grow up? +
Oh, well, I think this might be it. +
What do you want to be when you grow up? +
I'd like to move back to Iowa and have kids, +
and be a cop. +
I felt like I was in my bedroom when I was 16, +
and I used to hang out with this guy who was really beautiful +
and my parents thought I was helping him +
with his chemistry homework. +
Do you mind if we just lie here? +
I get so lonely in the city. +
Sometimes it's just nice to lie with someone. +
Sure. +
We could do that. +
It was hard to imagine that anyone so beautiful +
could ever be lonely. +
Meanwhile, somewhere below 14th street, +
two ordinary Joes +
were doing their own lonely late-night thing. +
Anything else, miss? +
No, that's it. +
Just cat food? +
Yes, just cat food. +
Hey. +
Oh, hi, Skipper. +
So like, um, how come you haven't been returning any of my calls? +
I'm sorry, it's been a really busy week. +
I thought we had a connection. +
Oh, I don't know. +
Could I get my change? +
You mean you get that way with every guy that you're with? +
No, it's just... +
Don't you want to go out with a girl your own age? +
It's got nothing to do with age. +
I-- I think you're luminous. +
You think I'm luminous? +
Totally. +
Miranda couldn't resist the vision of herself +
reflected in Skipper's slightly smudged lenses. +
All right, let's get out of here. +
Okay, yeah, let me just pay for my Cap'n Crunch . +
There's cereal at my place. +
Oh. +
And Samantha found the ultimate validation, +
sex with Barkley. +
So, uh... +
Where is it? +
What? +
The camera. +
Your friend Carrie tell you about that? +
Uh-huh. +
Don't worry, I only tape models. +
I won't mind. +
Fine, I'll make an exception. +
Samantha demanded nothing less than the same consideration +
given every other model in town. +
Hello. +
Carrie, it's Stanford. +
Do you have any idea what happened to Derek last night? +
Actually, +
you'll never believe it, but... +
Yes? +
It's Stanford. +
Hi, Stanford. +
Uh, uh, Derek? +
Could you put Carrie back on the phone? +
Sure. +
Hello. +
How could you? +
I didn't. +
We just talked. +
Oh, I knew he was gay. +
It's amazing what you'll do to be with these models. +
I've got to retire soon. +
They keep me from getting work done. +
They make me fuck up my life. +
Look at me! +
I'm an old man at 34! +
I began to realize that being beautiful +
is like having a rent-controlled apartment overlooking the park, +
completely unfair, and usually bestowed +
upon those who deserve it least. +
I'm not interrupting your work, am I? +
Hey, what a surprise. +
I can't stay. I'm late for a meeting, +
but I've been thinking about that article you're writing, +
about men who date models. +
Yeah, what about them? +
First of all, +
there are so many goddamn gorgeous women out there in this city. +
What an amazing observation. +
But the thing is this, +
after a while, +
you just want to be with the one that makes you laugh. +
Know what I mean? +
Okay. +
See ya. +
I take that back... +
beauty is fleeting, +
but a rent-controlled apartment overlooking the park is forever. +



“完美与平凡” +
一位跟米兰达不是很熟的男人 昨晚邀她参加一个晚餐派对 +
她当时跟尼克瓦克勒约会 他是个成功的运动经纪人 +
还曾说过她有双漂亮的腿 +
在他们还年轻时 你想跟他们上床的电影明星 +
在不在世都可以吗？ +
可以﹐从我先开始 +
维洛妮卡拉克 +
她拍“苏利文游记”时 +
大维 +
苏菲亚萝兰 +
我爸一直很喜欢她 +
-别做梦﹐蒙哥马利克里夫 -他是同性恋 +
玛丽莲梦露 在甘迺迪兄弟上了她之前 +
平克劳斯贝 +
我想好了 +
史恩康纳莱 不论是过去﹑现在还是未来 +
第一次约会时米兰达觉得 自己像是击出了全垒打 +
-谢谢 -你认识尼克多久了？ +
我们多年来一直搭同一部电梯 +
几星期前开始共进午餐 然后他邀请我来吃晚餐 +
-我们都很喜欢他 -他很聪明 +
-他听进我们最后的通牒了 -迪妮 +
你是什么意思？ +
她们告诉米兰达 尼克偏好模特儿 +
在他们年轻时你想跟他们 上床的老电影明星﹐我先来 +
维洛妮卡拉克 拍“苏利文游记”时 +
-大维 -苏菲亚萝兰 +
我爸一直很喜欢她 +
-蒙哥马利克里夫 -玛丽莲梦露 +
平克劳斯贝 +
-伊薇 -我不知道﹐查理辛 +
她们来吃晚餐 玩弄食物﹐嘴巴噘得高高地 +
-维洛妮卡拉克 -苏菲亚萝兰 +
-蒙哥马利克里夫 -玛丽莲梦露 +
-平克劳斯贝 -玛丽莎 +
她得去打电话 +
他一定有问题 于是他们决定采取行动 +
你难道找不到 谈吐合宜的女人吗？ +
-对﹐且吃完东西不必吃泻药 -你在说什么？ +
你不能再带模特儿来 +
你们太严厉了吧 +
好吧﹐我会想办法的 +
-于是他带你来 -很明显地你不是模特儿 +
-一点都没错 -尼克都跟模特儿约会？ +
米兰达跟他杠上了 没多久他就弃械投降 +
那是真的﹐好吗？ +
-我的确有病 -你迷恋模特儿 +
-没错 -而我是个聪明的丑八怪？ +
别生气﹐你必须承认 你认识了一些好人 +
而且玩得很开心 +
你跟一个模特儿狂约会 而你根本不知道这一点？ +
如果尼克那种人能约到模特儿 一般女人还有什么机会？ +
在纽约只有超级模特儿 才有约会的机会吗？ +
模特儿狂是很特别的族群 +
他们排名仅次于女人狂之后 +
女人狂 跟所有穿裙子的东西上床 +
模特儿狂是种迷恋 他们迷恋模特儿﹐而非女人 +
在大部分的城市模特儿 只能在看板及杂志上看到 +
在曼哈顿她们到处都是 +
把纽约变成 充满模特儿的原始大地 +
男人能将她们 豢养在原本的栖息地 +
我们的问题已经更多了 +
她们又蠢又懒 一看到她们就该格杀勿论 +
很多男人说我有模特儿的美貌 但我自食其力 +
我像是攀上巅峰的模特儿 +
模特儿跟美女拥有的优势 +
是那么地不公平 这让我觉得想吐 +
-但你很可爱啊 -可爱在纽约不吃香 +
可爱哪比得上超级模特儿 +
四个单身女子 一谈起模特儿莫不咬牙切齿 +
这让沉闷的星期二夜晚 增添几分趣味 +
-她们长得既冷冷漠又性感 -那不是性感﹐是饥饿才对 +
那些饥饿的女人 能在最高级的餐厅用餐 +
我想知道男人何时一致决定 +
只在看到大波霸时 长颈鹿才会勃起？ +
在某些文化中长胡子的胖女人 被认为是大美人 +
你说那句话时 眼睛是在盯着我看吗？ +
我们的文化 为美丽树立了不可能的标准 +
-但男人觉得那是可能的 -是啊 +
不管我觉得多自在 看到克里斯蒂特林顿我就输了 +
我想强迫她吃猪油 那就是我们之间的不同 +
你在胡说什么？ 看看你们两个﹐你们很漂亮的 +
-我讨厌我的大腿 -少来了 +
我看杂志时 会不由自主地想着“大腿” +
我要你的大腿 把我的下巴给你 +
我要你的下巴﹐给均KA +
-什么？ -少来了 +
-我喜欢自己的长相 -没错﹐为了它你花大把银子 +
我不喜欢那样子 我不相信整型手术 +
是时间未到 +
我觉得很有趣 四个如假包换的大美女 +
被不真实的幻想所恐吓 我是说… +
看看这个 +
这真的吓到你们了吗？ +
-我讨厌我的大腿 -把鸡肉递过来 +
那件洋装我也有 +
突然间我感到有兴趣 +
如果模特儿能让理性的人 对自己毫无信心 +
美丽的力量有多大呢？ +
两种男人会爱上美女 +
失业的可怜虫 +
以及会立刻陷入爱河的男人 那真是太可悲了 +
如果你能上穿裙子广告模特儿 干嘛跟穿裙子的女孩上床 +
长得漂亮是一种力量 你要什么就有什么 +
什么东西都能够得到 曾有人请我到阿斯彭度假 +
到巴黎度周末 到圣巴尔斯岛过圣诞节 +
摩托车﹐美酒… +
模特儿并非没有脑袋 她们真的有 +
只不过她们从来不用脑袋 +
大部分男人觉得模特儿很笨 但我很有文学素养﹐我会看书 +
我会坐下来一页页地看杂志 +
还有潜水装 +
帮赫伯瑞兹拍照 +
为宝格丽的项链作广告 靠我的胸部来赚钱 +
我朋友觉得我很肤浅 有时我认为他们说得对 +
但在其他的时候我会想 “我可是在跟模特儿胡搞” +
模特儿没你想像中 那么高不可攀 +
跟模特儿胡搞 要比跟普通女孩胡搞容易 +
因为对她们来说是家常便饭 +
一般人只会在度假时胡搞 +
巴克利是声名狼藉的模特儿狂 也是苏活族的传奇人物之一 +
他过着舒服的生活 +
但连一幅画都没卖掉 +
-很容易就能认识她们吗？ -没那么容易 +
重点是 要把她们当成一般女孩看待 +
一看到她们就得发动攻击 然后就没搞头了 +
那就跟溜狗一样 你得拿出勇气来 +
-你把她们当成东西看待？ -对 +
她们是东西 她们是美丽的东西 +
那就是我的生活﹐你懂吗？ +
我追逐美丽 +
我有样东西要给你看看 +
这是我真正的艺术创作 但无法将它们公诸于世 +
至少现在还不行﹐坐吧 +
她是凡妮莎﹐还有谭雅 +
伊拉娜跟克芮蒂娜 +
我不敢相信 +
这家伙跟九月“时尚杂志” 一半的香水广告模特儿上过床 +
她们知道吗？ +
或许知道吧﹐你看那个 +
她才刚当上模特儿 但有一天她会成为超级名模 +
我不知道该说什么 只能说… +
-有火吗？ -有啊 +
那天稍后我很高兴地发现了 +
至少有个黄金王老五 不屑跟模特儿往来 +
-我真的爱上你朋友米兰达 -你是在开玩笑吧﹐太棒了 +
她既性感又聪明 +
她有告诉你 我们上床了吗？ +
有啊﹐真是热情如火 +
你为什么不打电话给她？ 她一定会很高兴的 +
我打过一百次了 但她没回我电话 +
我不知道﹐她有提起我吗？ +
-没有 -或许她很忙 +
-她觉得我不够可爱吗？ -当然不是﹐你很可爱 +
我不知道﹐帮我问问看 我想知道还有没有机会 +
-在你面前打？ -打吧﹐我承受得了 +
我是米兰达﹐请留言 +
是答录机 +
我是史奇普﹐我跟凯莉在一起 我跟她说你不会回我电话 +
你现在得回我电话 你最好快打电话给我 +
我是在开玩笑的 +
说真的﹐我希望你回我电话 +
我提醒过我是史奇普吗？ +
我相信帮朋友拉红线 一定会被诅咒 +
有什么地方比服装秀会场 更容易找到模特儿狂呢？ +
还好我朋友史丹佛巴勒奇 有客户参加了最热门的服装秀 +
“骨头”就像是 人类中的貂皮大衣 +
他真的是太美了 有时我发现自己得把眼光移开 +
你看到他了吗？ +
-就在那边 -在哪里？ +
天啊﹐你看看他 他带着私人打光师巡回走秀 +
德瑞克别名“骨头” +
他是最红的内衣模特儿 史丹佛最重要的客户 +
也是他单相思的对象 +
你来了﹐史丹佛 +
德瑞克 这位是我的好友凯莉布雷萧 +
很高兴认识你 +
凯莉是“欲望城市”专栏作家 +
-你看过这个专栏吗？ -没有 +
有天德瑞克跟我 走过他的广告看板下方 +
他告诉我他想把一片看板 譬如说鼻子的部分拿回家去 +
我说“拿内裤凸出那一块 当女人问你有多大时” +
“你可以告诉她 我有十四寸大” +
那真的很好笑﹐对吧？ +
大家都在谈论你 你真的是太棒了 +
你会是个大明星的 我告诉过你多少次了 +
我们最好让你去换衣服 +
我已经换好了 +
-结束后见 -没问题 +
再见 +
你能相信那么帅的男人 会那么有礼貌吗？ +
我一直梦想有一天他会说 “史丹佛﹐我爱你” +
-他是同性恋吗？ -他否认 +
那么帅的男人 怎么可能是异性恋？ +
亲爱的﹐快过来 +
莎曼珊从未错过大型服装秀 +
她认为接近俊男美女 +
能让自己更有吸引力 +
发生了什么事？ 你在展示台边找不到位置吗？ +
从这个角度 你能看到所有的缺点 +
-你好﹐凯莉 -巴克利﹐你好吗？ +
-你要参加庆功派对吗？ -我不知道 +
我们当然要参加 你好﹐我是莎曼珊 +
我是巴克利 +
他是不是同志？ +
不是 +
真的吗？他好可爱 你们没在约会吧？ +
天啊﹐没有﹐他只爱模特儿 +
他现在跟某位模特儿约会吗？ +
事实上他跟她们都睡过 +
-他只跟模特儿上床？ -没错 +
稍后我们都参加了庆功派对 +
我陷在甜马铃薯泡芙堆里 +
还有腌鲑鱼跟酸奶酪 就是那么巧… +
大人物出现了 +
他是商业大亨﹐也是个万人迷 他跟我不是同一个世界的人 +
我就知道我看到的人是你 +
你好 +
在我们认识后 我开始看你的专栏 +
-是吗？ -没错﹐挺可爱的 +
“挺可爱的”？ +
没错﹐挺可爱的 你这星期要写什么？ +
我正在写 +
跟模特儿约会的男人 你有什么想法吗？ +
他们的运气很好 +
跟模特儿约会的男人 你有什么了解？ +
我发现他们之中有些人 把这样的行为当成体育竞赛 +
其他人则只是需要被认可 +
或许其他人是迷恋超级美女 +
没错 +
-那有什么不对吗？ -不会啊 +
我只是觉得有点单调 +
要吃泡芙吗？ +
-不﹐谢谢你 -对不起 +
你都在哪里写作？ +
-你是指“可爱的”文章吗？ -你有办公室吗？ +
没有 有一半的时间我待在家里 +
其他时间我都在七十三街 跟麦迪逊街口的咖啡馆 +
凯莉﹐这位是米夏 +
-你在伸展台上很漂亮 -谢谢你的夸奖 +
突然间我觉得 自己像是天鹅堆里的丑小鸭 +
很高兴能跟你聊天 +
再见 +
希望能再见 +
我以为过了三十岁 我可以不在乎自己的长相 +
我了解 我不再有力气去做肤浅的事 +
你朋友巴克利来约我 +
他认为我是模特儿吗？ +
-不论原因为何﹐别去 -为什么？ +
他会偷偷录下交欢的过程 +
真的吗？ +
真是个变态 +
当莎曼珊准备好上镜头时 +
我觉得我该回家了 +
我从未觉得如此渺小过 +
计程车 +
-凯莉 -你好﹐史丹佛离开了吗？ +
他在帮凡赛斯模特儿按摩脖子 你要去哪里？ +
-我要回家 -我能跟你去吗？ +
你要跟我回家？ +
对﹐只要你家很安静 我受不了人很多的地方 +
我是为了研究才这么做 +
你不跟女模特儿共度春宵吗？ +
不﹐我从不跟模特儿约会 我觉得她们很笨 +
我纳闷着 是否有美丽的物理学法则 +
或许两个模特儿会互相排斥 +
或许模特儿只能吸引一般人 +
-我觉得能写作很酷 -谢谢 +
真希望我也能写作 我有很多不错的想法 +
但还来不及把它们写下前 便忘得精光 +
-这是有窍门的 -我有神经过敏的毛病 +
前一分钟我还很酷地走在街上 +
下一分钟 我毫无理由地感到沮丧 +
我总是羞于启口 +
我会先想一想再说话 免得说错了话 +
-那不会很浪费时间吗？ -只要几秒就能搞定 +
-有时我会分心 -现在什么东西让你分心？ +
-你的鼻子 -谢了﹐我讨厌我的鼻子 +
不﹐你的鼻子很可爱 我也讨厌我的鼻子 +
我的鼻子太大了 但那要视我的头发而定 +
没错 +
我了解你的意思 +
你希望长大后做什么？ +
我已完成了梦想﹐就是写作 +
你长大想做什么 +
我想搬回爱荷华州 生儿育女﹐当个警察 +
这就像我十六岁时跟帅哥鬼混 +
我父母以为我在教他功课一样 +
我们能躺一下吗？ 在纽约我觉得很寂寞 +
有时能跟某人躺在一起 就是一种幸福 +
没问题 +
很难想像 那么帅的人会觉得寂寞 +
同时两个凡夫俗子 寂寞地过着他们的夜晚 +
-还要别的东西吗？小姐 -不必了 +
-你只买猫食？ -没错 +
-你好 -史奇普 +
你为什么不回我电话？ +
抱歉﹐这星期我很忙 +
-我还以为我们算是在交往 -我不知道 +
麻烦把零钱找给我 +
你跟每个男人都这样吗？ +
不﹐我只是… +
你不想 跟同年龄的女孩约会吗？ +
这跟年龄无关 我觉得你很聪明 +
-你觉得我很聪明 -没错 +
米兰达抗拒不了 自己在模糊镜片上的倒影 +
-好了﹐我们快走了 -我得付玉米片的钱 +
我家有玉米片 +
莎曼珊找到了最有力的证据 +
她跟巴克利上床了 +
好了 +
-在哪里呢？ -什么东西啊？ +
摄影机 +
凯莉跟你提过那玩意？ +
别担心﹐我只拍模特儿 +
-我不会介意的 -好吧﹐我可以破例一次 +
莎曼珊要求 跟每个模特儿一样的待遇 +
-你好 -凯莉﹐我是史丹佛 +
你知道德瑞克昨晚去哪里吗？ +
-事实上你不会相信的﹐但… -什么事？ +
是史丹佛打来的 +
你好﹐史丹佛 +
德瑞克 麻烦你请凯莉来听电话 +
没问题 +
你怎么能这么做？ +
-我没有﹐我们只是在聊天 -我就知道他是同性恋 +
跟模特儿在一起真的很辛苦 +
我很快就得退休 她们害得我工作做不完 +
她们害得我搞砸了我的人生 看看我这个鬼样子 +
我是个三十四岁的老头 +
我开始了解当帅哥美女 +
就像是租下 一间俯视公园美景的出租公寓 +
那根本就不公平 该把它送给那些有资格的人 +
-我没打扰你工作吧？ -真是个大惊喜 +
我已经迟到了﹐没办法久留 但我在想跟模特儿约会的男人 +
-他们怎么了？ -首先 +
纽约有许多美女 +
你真是好眼力 +
但事实上 +
过了一阵子后 你只想跟能逗你笑的人在一起 +
了解我的意思了吗？ +
再见 +
我收回那句话﹐美丽是短暂的 +
一间俯视公园美景的出租公寓 却是永远 +
