*3人行* +
从前在名叫曼哈顿的魔幻之地 +
一个年轻女子恋爱了 +
在鼻咽癌单身汉慈善拍卖会上 夏绿蒂跟杰克看对眼 +
她在纽约的所有疾病慈善会上 追逐着他的身影 +
色素性视网膜炎慈善会后 他们正式约会 +
杰克非常适合她 +
他是建筑师﹐慈善家 他们之间的性无以伦比 +
某天晚上 杰克丢出一个必然的问题 +
那么… +
-你有什么幻想？ -天啊 +
我想自己开一间画廊 在缅因州有栋小别墅 +
事实上我指的是 像在飞机洗手间上乱搞的幻想 +
关于飞机跟乱搞 夏绿蒂最接近的幻想 +
是她的行李掉了 +
我一直想在我爸妈的床上做爱 +
-挺狂野的﹐我喜欢 -你呢？ +
-你﹐我跟另一个女人一起做 -少来了 +
我是认真的 +
夏绿蒂 你不知道自己多性感﹐对吧？ +
你抚摸另一个女人 +
光是想我就硬了起来 +
-杰克想玩三P -当然﹐每个男人都想玩三P +
三P等于是九十年代的吹箫 +
-八十年代的吹箫是什么？ -肛交 +
别理他 他只是想试探你是不是同性恋 +
-没做过就别乱说 -我大学时曾玩过三P +
当时我喝醉了 醒来时穿着别人的胸罩 +
玩三P时一定要当来宾 +
走进去后搞完就离开 +
-那个代打者 -没错﹐那才是最好玩的 +
你能享受鱼水之欢 不必怀疑你跟男朋友的关系 +
-你没有男朋友 -所以我做爱时很尽兴 +
-我从没玩过三P -因为你老在交男朋友 +
-我永远都不会玩三P -当然 +
你会玩三P？ 你连丁字裤都不穿的 +
-杰克说我很性感 -他是在哄你 +
你得先觉得自己很性感 才会想要玩三P +
突然间你在吻另一个女人 他在一边打手枪 +
拜托 +
另一个女人绝不能是你朋友 +
找在酒吧或其他地方认识的人 +
-真浪漫 -不﹐我觉得跟朋友做较安全 +
跟我可以相信的人做 譬如说凯莉 +
天啊﹐我受宠若惊 +
但我要跟有经验的人做 譬如说莎曼珊 +
谢谢 +
跟夏绿蒂这种菜鸟做 也挺性感的 +
真的吗？ +
天啊﹐不﹐别理我 +
-少来了 -我愿意跟你们做 +
这就像在挑躲避球的队友 +
莎曼珊说得对吗？ 三P是新的性流行吗？ +
毫无疑问地男人爱死三P了 +
我开始认真地去找 发现他们无所不在 +
毕竟在生活中无三不成礼 +
全脂低脂脱脂﹐最初商业经济 摩伊﹑赖利﹑柯力 +
或许我们一直都不想 只跟另一个人做 +
或许三P 是未来男女关系的趋势 +
同时莎曼珊在大演 +
我称之为“莎曼珊 爱上有妇之夫”的戏码 +
-我爱死你不是我太太了 -我也一样 +
我喜欢你摆动屁股的样子 +
萝丝连胸罩都不肯脱 +
肯三十七岁 他是葡萄酒进口商 +
他的婚姻不幸福 太太是标准办公室家具设计师 +
这段外遇对他来说 +
是除了94年的 +
五小时后 夏绿蒂的夜晚才刚刚开始 +
她跟杰克有个浪漫的约会 在读写障碍慈善会上跳舞 +
你觉得她如何？ +
-她性感吗？ -杰克 +
你说对了 +
-或许她比较适合你的品味 -别说了 +
-你有火吗？ -抱歉﹐我不抽烟 +
太可惜了 +
你看到没有？她在跟我们调情 +
她在跟你调情 +
夏绿蒂﹐你很诱人 只是你并不知道 +
你经常散发出性魅力 +
就像你体内有熊熊烈火一样 +
无法跟你融为一体 她会发疯的 +
谁知道她是喝多了 还是她在发抖 +
但夏绿蒂突然觉得一阵暖意 +
-她把手放在我腿上 -我该邀请她加入我们吗？ +
那晚她大开眼界 +
夏绿蒂自从当上啦啦队员后 再也没有这么兴奋过 +
你觉得你的梦有什么含意？ +
我﹑夏绿蒂﹑莎曼珊跟凯莉 在沙堆里﹐她们不跟我玩 +
拜托﹐这很明显 +
米兰达在处理她自己的梦魇 +
我知道那很幼稚﹐却颇为困扰 我有吸引力﹐又聪明 +
大家都应该想跟我玩三P +
你是说你喜欢上你的女性朋友？ +
不﹐但如果你朋友不肯跟你玩 还有谁会跟你玩？ +
那只是一个梦 +
那个梦太逼真了 我没办法不想到它 +
-我还挺喜欢那个梦的 -太棒了 +
做梦是很棒的实验方法 +
那像是买下一件洋装 但不把标签撕掉 +
你觉得那表示我该玩三P吗？ +
杰克说我体内有熊熊烈火 +
-告诉他有灭火器这种东西 -我是认真的 +
-别为了让杰克快乐而那么做 -或许那么做我们会更亲密 +
你不觉得那很奇怪吗？ +
跟一个你不认识的人睡觉 只为了跟杰克更亲密？ +
但我们对枕边人又了解多少？ +
夏绿蒂就是那样﹐当你觉得 她是个脑袋空空的拜金女时 +
她会说出达赖喇嘛式的名言 +
我的头发太亮了吗？ +
然后她又扯到别的地方去 +
但还有一个更大的问题 +
如果连夏绿蒂都想玩三P 谁不想呢？ +
“村声”里 寻找三P对象的广告 +
比月租一千块的 小型烂工作室出租广告还多 +
但谁会回应这些广告呢？ +
华尔街老板寻找两个好色女 +
在我的避暑小屋开性派对 胖女人勿试 +
甜美的郊区老师 寻找两个男人来满足她的幻想 +
黑人或西班牙人都可 我会准时到达 +
我现在就要你的老二 +
X档案迷夫妻为满足绑架幻想 寻找长得像史考莉的女孩 +
我是有大咪咪的美女 你们是有品味的夫妻 +
让我们来体验这个城市的一切 +
我什么都愿意做 +
我似乎是唯一 +
仍相信一对一爱情的人 +
大人物跟我会在彼此家中过夜 +
哪一条？ +
这条 +
你最好小心一点 我可能会上瘾的 +
为什么帮男人打领带 +
有时比帮男人 解开领带还性感？ +
午休时你要做什么？ 我可以溜出来一小时 +
抱歉﹐我没空 +
-我得去跟别人面谈 -谈什么？ +
三P性游戏﹐你玩过吗？ +
当然﹐谁没玩过？ +
真的吗？你跟谁？ +
我前妻 +
突然间 我将写专栏的事抛诸脑后 +
-你结过婚？ -是啊﹐我以为我告诉过你 +
你没说过 +
-他有前妻﹐情况有了新变化 -他们性生活狂野﹐还玩三P +
年轻时我们的性生活都很狂野 但现在只能慢慢来 +
-狂野还是比慢慢来好 -但现在他没跟她在一起了 +
因为他们不再有狂野的性生活 +
-肯的太太不肯帮他吹 -我一点都不感到安慰 +
他永远都不会为你离开他太太 男人永远都不会那么做 +
谢天谢地﹐谁都不想惹麻烦 我不用去忍受那些事 +
你说起话来 跟厕所清洁剂推销员一样 +
这个颜色能挑起你的情欲吗？ +
米兰达下定决心 +
-有点橘 -现在只剩一个办法 +
-在他离开我前先离开他？ -别闹了﹐去探探他前妻底细 +
夏绿蒂说得对 我们真的不了解枕边人 +
毕竟我又了解大人物什么呢？ +
只知道他前妻叫芭芭拉 她在出版界工作 +
我打算用 出罗曼史的企划案来钓她 +
她很可能会拒绝我 但我可以跟她面对面谈谈 +
是凯莉吗？ +
快进来﹐芭芭拉已经在等你了 +
谢谢﹐再见 凯莉布雷萧﹐我真的很高兴 +
请坐﹐我是你的超级书迷 +
有品味又漂亮﹐她无懈可击 +
特殊奥运主席 +
抱歉﹐我还没空把它挂起来 我很期待你的企划案 +
我不知道你对写童书有兴趣 +
谁不喜欢童书呢？ +
罗曼史的企划案失败 +
于是我做了所有作家会做的事 我开始随口瞎掰 +
故事的主角是个小女孩 +
她叫做凯西 +
-小凯西 -小凯西有何过人之处？ +
她有魔法… +
香烟 +
她有魔法香烟？ +
对﹐小凯西有魔法香烟 +
只要一把烟点燃 她想去哪里都可以 +
她可以去阿拉伯﹑新泽西 +
当然内容还可以改 +
你要写一本关于抽烟的童书？ +
那是给大人看的童书 +
-你真是天才﹐我喜欢 -我就知道你会喜欢 +
我一直想做游走边缘的题材 这本书可能会大红大紫 +
我受不了﹐她聪明漂亮 她迷倒我了 +
我得杀了她 +
莎曼珊 将跟外遇对象的太太见面 +
-抱歉 -对不起﹐是你啊 +
-莎曼珊 -你们认识？ +
-没错 -我们不熟 +
萝丝﹐这位是莎曼珊 她跟我买过葡萄酒 +
-莎曼珊﹐这位是我太太萝丝 -你好 +
-你好 -我们该走了﹐再见 +
那天下午莎曼珊不到两分钟 完全地击垮了一个男人 +
米兰达越深入分析 就越难释怀 +
我们四个搭计程车时 她们就是不跟我坐 +
她们要我跟司机坐 他长得像帕瑞吉家族的克里斯 +
你还在为朋友 不肯跟你发生性关系而难过 +
我要问你一件事 +
你愿意跟我玩三P吗？ +
我们得谈谈 你为什么要问我这个问题 +
你不愿意吗？ +
那晚我以为 我能忘了芭芭拉的事 +
毕竟大人物现在跟我在一起 +
你在咬他的耳垂？ 真的是太棒了 +
我来教你该怎么做才对 +
看来谁都避免不了三P性关系 +
即使现在躺在床上的人是你 +
但在那之前 曾有人依偎在他身边 +
怎么了？你要去哪里？ +
-我在想事情 -不会吧﹐你在想什么？ +
你前妻的胸部﹑嘴唇跟长腿 +
我在想专栏的事 +
我没告诉你我结过婚 因为那是很久以前的事 +
-发生了什么事？ -我们貌合神离﹐后来离婚了 +
别谈过去的事了 +
大人物并不了解 我无法释怀过去 +
隔天芭芭拉约我吃午餐 +
-谢谢你赶来 -谢谢你约我吃饭 +
你换了发型 +
谢谢 +
-我有坏消息要通知你 -我跟大人物复合了 +
大头们不喜欢小凯西的故事 +
就算好书送上门来 他们也不知道 +
-对啊﹐别理他们 -我还是很喜欢你的企划 +
听起来或许很煽情 +
我真的很想跟你做朋友 +
做朋友？ +
两小时后我跟敌人共枕 +
-你没过婚吗？ -很久以前结过一次 +
-真的吗？发生了什么事？ -他喜欢四处偷腥 +
连我最好的朋友都不放过 +
你有男朋友吗？ +
没有 +
对莎曼珊来说 坏消息正要传来 +
-你好 -结束了﹐我告诉我太太了？ +
-你是哪位？ -我是肯 +
-你把我们的事告诉萝丝？ -我爱上你了 +
-现在我们能在一起了 -不 +
等一下 +
-你好 -是莎曼珊吗？ +
我是萝丝辛勒﹐肯的太太 +
-我查到你的电话号码 -等一下 +
-听我说﹐你爱你太太 -不﹐我爱的是你 +
不 +
莎曼珊不伤大雅的外遇事件 变成一场恶梦 +
-说吧 -我不知道你是谁 +
肯跟我彼此相爱 +
-那是当然的事 -我们的关系密不可分 +
我一定会维持这段婚姻 +
那太好了﹐听着﹐萝丝 这是个天大的错误 +
除了性﹐那不具任何意义 +
没错 +
如果性冒险能维持婚姻 +
我准备跟均KA +
还有他一同上床 +
不 +
莎曼珊是特别来宾 她不喜欢当固定班底 +
那晚在募款舞会中 +
夏绿蒂放纵于她的幻想中 +
很难想像一个小小的面具 能让人完全抛去束缚 +
谁是你要的那一型？ +
-你喜欢孔雀吗？ -你呢？ +
然后夏绿蒂 做了令人难以想像的事 +
天啊﹐她对我眨眼 +
-太棒了 -我得离开这里 +
-你没事吧？ -应该没事 +
-你觉得如何？ -怪怪的 +
我挺喜欢的 +
-我还有一个幻想 -是什么呢？ +
在宾客满堂的派对中 溜到楼上的房间做爱 +
我能加入你们吗？ +
她明白那一刻终于来了 +
她想放纵于情欲中 就得把握这一刻 +
不幸的是 先一头栽进去的人是杰克 +
看来另一个女人 比夏绿蒂更性感 +
她不是这场幻想的特别来宾 +
同时在市区的酒吧中… +
-你是米兰达吗？ -你好 +
真的是太好了 +
大部分回应我们广告的女人 都有点… +
-她们丑毙了 -跟你完全不同 +
-谢谢 -我们从没做过这种事 +
这是马克的梦想 也是我送他的三十岁生日礼物 +
你怎么不送他笔呢？ +
你今晚有事吗？ +
我得话把说清楚 你们想跟我玩三P +
如果你很忙﹐我们能了解 +
听我说 我得去打通电话﹐好吗？ +
那晚米兰达终于得到了肯定 +
心理医生建议她 一星期去找他三次 +
我八天没跟大人物见面 +
-真的﹐还挺好吃的 -是啊 +
事实上食物烂透了 我们跟陌生人一样 +
到底发生了什么事？ +
你告诉我你结过婚 +
你们还玩过三P 对﹐是我开口问的 +
但你丢了一颗大炸弹 却不跟我说个清楚 +
甚至没告诉我 你们为什么要分手 +
-我背着她偷人 -我知道﹐午餐时她告诉我了 +
我知道你已经知道了 她告诉我她已经跟你说过 +
是她跟你说的？还有这件事 +
你没告诉我你们还有联络 +
-我跟我所有的前妻都有联络 -那一点都不好笑 +
等一下 +
我们会玩三P 因为我们在寻找适合自己的人 +
你认识任何适合我的人吗？ +
我们言归于好 我了解到玩三P的真正意义 +
很简单 +
因为两人之间不再亲密 +
Once upon a time, +
in a magical land called Manhattan, +
a young woman fell in love. +
Charlotte and Jack locked eyes +
at a black-tie benefit for Epstein/Barr. +
She chased him through every disease in New York. +
They've been officially dating +
since retinitis pigmentosa. +
Jack was perfect for her. +
Architect, philanthropist, +
and the sex was amazing. +
Late one night, +
Jack popped the inevitable question. +
-So... -Mm? +
What are your fantasies? +
Oh, God. +
I'd love to own my own gallery, +
and maybe a little cottage in Maine. +
Well, actually I meant more like +
screwing in an airplane bathroom kind of fantasies. +
Oh. +
The closest Charlotte had ever come +
to getting screwed on a plane +
was the time she lost all her luggage +
on a flight to Palm Beach. +
Well, I've always wanted to do it in my parents' bed. +
Wild, I like it. +
What about you? +
You, me, and another woman. +
Come on! +
I'm serious. +
Charlotte, you have no idea how sexy you are, +
do you? +
The idea of you touching another woman... +
God, it makes me hard just thinking about it. +
Wow. +
Jack wants us to do a threesome! +
Of course, he does, every guy does. +
Threesomes are huge right now. +
They're the blow job of the '90. +
What was the blow job of the '80s? +
Anal sex. +
Any sex, period. +
Don't let him pressure you into it. +
It's just this guy's cheap ploy +
to watch you be a lesbian for a night. +
Don't knock it until you've tried it. +
I had a threesome once, I think. In college. +
I was drunk. I woke up in someone else's bra. +
The only way to do a threesome +
is to be the guest star. +
The guest star? +
The girl the couple gets to come in, +
screw, and leave. +
The pinch hitter. +
Exactly. It's perfect. +
All the great sex without wondering +
what it will do to your relationship. +
But you don't have relationships. +
Which is why I have great sex. +
I've never done a threesome. +
Because you have relationships. +
Well, I've never done a threesome. +
Oh, come on. Of course, you haven't. +
You in a threesome? You won't even wear a thong! +
Well, Jack thinks I'm sexy. +
He's just buttering you up. +
First, you start thinking you're hot, +
then he brings up the threesome thing, boom! +
Suddenly you're kissing another woman while he beats off. +
Please. +
Just make sure that the other woman +
isn't a friend. +
Use somebody random. +
You know, somebody you meet in a bar or something. +
That's romantic. +
No, I think that I'd feel safer with a friend, +
with someone I could trust, like Carrie. +
Oh, gee, I'm flattered. +
But um... I'd go with someone who has a little more experience, like Sam. +
Well, thanks. +
But there is something sexy about a first-timer +
like Charlotte. +
Really? +
Mm-hmm. +
Oh, great, no, forget about me. +
Oh, oh. -Oh, come on. +
You know, I'd do it with you guys! +
It's like... +
It's like picking teams for dodgeball all over again. +
Was Samantha right? +
Were threesomes the new sexual frontier? +
♪ One, two, three True love ♪ +
No question. +
Guys were infatuated with threesomes. +
And when I started looking, they were everywhere. +
After all, +
our lives are built on threesomes. +
Fat, low-fat, non-fat, first, business, economy. +
Moe, Larry, Curly. +
Maybe we were never meant to do it +
with only one other person. +
Maybe threesomes were the relationship of the future. +
Meanwhile, Samantha had been busy +
guest starring in a show I like to call +
"Sam Does the Married Guy." +
I love that you're not my wife. +
I love that too. +
I mean, that thing you do with your hips, +
Ruth won't even get on top. +
Ken was 37, a wine importer, +
unhappily married to a woman +
who designed modular office furniture. +
This affair was the most exciting thing +
that had happened to him since the '94 Montrachet. +
Five hours later, Charlotte's night was just beginning. +
She and Jack had just had another fantastic date, +
dancing for dyslexia. +
So, uh, what do you think of her? +
Is she hot? +
Jack! +
Yeah, you're right. +
Maybe she's more your taste. +
Stop it. +
Have a light? +
Sorry, I don't smoke. +
That's a shame. +
Did you see that? +
She was flirting with us. +
I think she was flirting with you. +
Charlotte, you are such a turn-on. +
And you have no idea. +
You're giving off this sexual energy all the time. +
A vibe like you've got a fire inside of you. +
She'd be crazy not to be into you. +
Who knows whether it was her vodka or her vibe, +
but Charlotte suddenly did feel a little warm. +
I think she put her hand on my leg. +
So should I ask her to join us? +
That night, she had an eye-opening experience. +
Charlotte hadn't been that excited +
since she tried on her JV cheerleading uniform for the first time. +
So what do you think your dream meant? +
I'm in the sand box with Charlotte, Sam, and Carrie. +
None of them will play with me. Please, it's obvious. +
Across town, Miranda was dealing with her own nightmare. +
Look, I know it's juvenile, but it bothers me. +
I'm attractive, I'm smart, right? +
Plenty of people should want me for a threesome. +
So you're saying that you're attracted to your girlfriends? +
No! +
But if your friends won't go down on you, +
who will? +
Well, that's some dream. +
It was so real. +
I can't stop thinking about it. +
-And I think I enjoyed it. -That's great. +
Dreams are a really good way to experiment. +
It's like buying a dress and keeping the tags on. +
But do you think it means I should do it? +
Have a threesome? +
Jack says that I have a fire inside me. +
You tell him they make a cream for that. +
I'm serious! +
I don't know. It's your call. +
But don't do it just to make Jack happy. +
Maybe it would bring us closer. +
Sweetie, don't you think it's weird +
that you're thinking of sleeping with someone you don't know +
to get closer to Jack? +
But how well do we ever know the people we sleep with? +
That was the thing about Charlotte. +
Just when you were about to write her off +
as a Park Avenue Pollyanna, +
she'd say something so right on, +
you'd think she was the Dalai Lama. +
Do you think my hair is too shiny today? +
And then she'd say something else. +
Do you? +
But the bigger question remained, +
if Charlotte was actually considering a threesome, +
who wasn't? +
The Village Voice had more ads +
looking for threesomes +
than it did for small, +
rat-infested studios +
renting at $1,000 a month. +
But who actually answered these ads? +
Wall Street honcho seeks two horny gal pals +
for an East Hampton fuck-fest at my summer home. +
No fatties, please. +
Sweet, suburban schoolteacher +
seeks two men to fulfill her wildest fantasies. +
You be black or Hispanic, I'll be on time. +
I need your dick now. +
X-Files fanatic twosome +
seeks Scully look-alike for abduction fantasy. +
Me, gorgeous with big boobs. +
You, a couple with class. +
Let's experience everything the city has to offer. +
I'm into museums, blow jobs, theater, +
and golden showers. +
I seemed to be the only person in New York +
who still believed in the one-on-one relationship. +
Mr. Big and I were actually doing sleepovers. +
Which one? +
This one. +
You better be careful, +
I could get used to this. +
Why is it that putting a tie around a man's neck +
is sometimes even sexier than taking it off? +
What are you doing for lunch today? +
I could maybe swing an hour between meetings. +
Oh, no, sorry, I can't. +
I have to interview someone. +
About what? +
Threesomes. +
Ever done one? +
Sure, who hasn't? +
Really? +
With who? +
My ex-wife. +
Suddenly, my column was the last thing on my mind. +
You were married? +
Yeah, I, uh, thought I told you. +
No, no, you didn't. +
An ex-wife, that's a new twist. +
Yeah, and they had wild sex, threesomes. +
We don't have wild sex. +
We used to, but now we have sweet sex. +
Wild always beats out sweet. +
But he's not with her anymore. +
Well, probably because they stopped having wild sex. +
You know, that's why Ken's fucking me. +
His wife won't even give him a blow job. +
Is that supposed to make me feel better? +
He's never gonna leave his wife for you, you know. +
They never do. +
Thank God. Who needs the trouble? +
This is ideal, no muss, no fuss. +
Sounds like you're selling toilet bowl cleaner. +
Does this color turn you on? +
You had to hand it to Miranda, she was determined. +
It's a little bit orange. +
You know, there's only one thing left to do. +
What, leave him before he leaves me? +
You kidding? +
Check out the ex. +
Charlotte was right. +
We don't really know the people we sleep with. +
After all, what did I really know about Mr. Big? +
Except he had an ex-wife named Barbara +
who I quickly discovered, worked in publishing. +
My plan was simple. +
I'd pitch her a steamy, bodice-ripping paperback, +
which she'd probably reject, +
but at least I'd get five minutes +
face-to-face with her. +
Carrie? +
Come right in, Barbara's ready for you. +
Thanks, bye. +
Carrie Bradshaw, I am so excited. +
Oh. -Sit down. +
I am a huge fan of your work! +
Good taste and beautiful. Could it get worse? +
Whoa. +
Special Olympics chairwoman. +
Sorry, I haven't hung it yet. +
So, I'm dying to hear your pitch. +
I never knew you were interested in writing children's books. +
Well, who doesn't love children's books? +
Five minutes of bodice-ripping material out the window. +
So I did what any writer would do. +
I pulled an idea out of my ass. +
Well, my story is about a little girl, +
named Cathy. +
Little Cathy. +
And what makes little Cathy special? +
Well, she's got these magic... +
cigarettes. +
She has magic cigarettes? +
Yes, little Cathy and her magic cigarettes. +
And whenever she lights up, she can go anywhere +
in the whole wide world. You know, Arabia, New Jersey. +
I mean that stuff is all gonna be worked out, of course. +
You wanna write a children's book about smoking? +
Well, it's a children's book for adults. +
You are outrageous. I love it! +
I thought you might. +
I've been dying to do something with an edge. +
This could be great. +
It was the last straw. +
She was smart, beautiful, and she got me. +
I'd have to kill her. +
Meanwhile, Samantha was about to have her own +
close encounter with the third kind. +
-Oh, I'm sorry. -Sorry. +
-Ken. -Sam! +
You two know each other? +
-Sure. -Not really. +
Uh, Ruth, this is Sam, Samantha. +
She bought some Pinot Noir from me. +
Uh, Sam, this is my wife, Ruth. +
-Hi. -Hi. +
Okay, we should be going, see ya. +
That afternoon was a first for Samantha. +
She successfully screwed a guy in under two minutes. +
The more Miranda analyzed, +
the worse her nightmares got. +
So, the four of us get into a cab, +
only they won't let me sit in back with them. +
They make me ride up front with the driver, +
who happens to be the original Chris +
from The Partridge Family . +
What I'm hearing is that you're still very upset +
about being sexually rejected by your friends. +
Let me ask you something? +
Would you do a threesome with me? +
I think we need to talk about why you're asking me that. +
I take that as a "no"? +
That night, I thought I could put the whole Barbara thing +
out of my mind. +
After all, Mr. Big was with me now. +
Nibbling his earlobes? +
How sweet. +
Let me show you how it's really done. +
So I guess you couldn't avoid a threesome, +
because even if you're the only person in the bed, +
someone has always been there before you. +
Hey, what just happened? +
Where'd you go? +
I was preoccupied. +
No kidding. About what? +
Your ex-wife's breasts, your ex-wife's lips, +
your ex-wife's long legs. +
My column. +
You know, I didn't tell you I was married +
because it was a long time ago. +
What happened? +
Alienation of affection, followed by divorce. +
Hmm. +
Let's not talk about the past, please. +
What Mr. Big didn't realize was +
the past was sleeping right next to me. +
Hey. +
The next day, the flesh and blood Barbara +
asked me to lunch. +
-Hi. -Hi. +
Thanks for meeting me. +
Oh, thanks for inviting me. +
Wow, you changed your hair. +
Oh, thanks. +
Listen, I have some not-great news. +
I'm back with Mr. Big? +
The head guys didn't go for Little Cathy . +
But fuck 'em, they wouldn't know a good book if it bit 'em in the ass. +
Yeah, fuck 'em. +
I still love the project, +
and at the risk of sounding like a groupie, +
I'd really like it if we could become friends. +
Friends? +
Two hours and four Chardonnays later, +
I was sleeping with the enemy. +
So never been married? +
Mm, once. Long time ago. +
Really? What happened? +
He had a wandering eye. +
It wandered right over to my best friend. +
So what about you? Are you seeing anyone? +
No one special. +
For Samantha, the shit was about to hit the phone. +
-Hello. +
It's over. I told my wife! +
Who is this? +
It's Ken. +
Wait, you told Ruth about us? +
I'm in love with you. +
Now we can be together. +
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no! +
-Hang on. +
-Hello. -Samantha? +
This is Ruth Scheer. Ken's wife. +
Yeah, I found your number in his sock drawer. +
Hang on. +
Listen to me, you love your wife. +
No, I'm in love with you! +
No, no, no, no, no, no! +
Sam's no muss, no fuss affair +
was starting to feel very mussy. +
I'm back. +
I don't know who you are, +
but Ken and I love each other very much. +
Of course you do. +
And we have an unshakable bond. +
Whatever it takes, I'm gonna keep this marriage together. +
Good for you! Now, listen, Ruth, this was a huge mistake. +
It didn't mean anything. +
It was just sex. +
Well, exactly! +
And if being sexually adventuresome +
will keep this marriage together, +
then I am prepared to join you... +
with him. +
In bed. +
Oh, no. +
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. +
Samantha was a guest star. +
Series regular was not in her contract. +
That night at the Attention Deficit Disorder masked ball, +
Charlotte felt free to indulge her fantasy. +
It's amazing what some sequins on a stick +
can do to free up inhibitions. +
So who here is your type? +
Do you like peacocks? +
Do you? +
Then Charlotte did the unthinkable. +
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, she winked at me. +
Excellent. +
I need to get out of here. +
Hey, you okay? +
Yeah, yeah, I think so. +
So how'd it feel? +
Weird. +
Well, I enjoyed it. +
I do have another fantasy. +
What's that? +
Doing it upstairs at a party. +
Can I join you? +
She realized that this was her moment. +
If she was going to take the plunge, +
it was now or never. +
Unfortunately, it was Jack who plunged first. +
Apparently, someone else's fire +
was a little stronger than Charlotte's. +
She was not the guest star in this fantasy. +
Meanwhile, at a bar downtown... +
Miranda? +
Hi. +
What a relief. +
Oh! +
Most of the women who answered our ad, well, +
they were, you know, kind of... +
-Butt ugly. -Yeah. +
Oh, nothing like you. +
Thanks. +
We've never done anything like this before. +
It's a huge fantasy of Mark's. +
I offered to do it for his 30th birthday. +
Whatever happened to giving a nice pen? +
So are-- are you doing anything tonight? +
Let me just be clear here. +
You want to do a threesome with me. +
Yeah. +
You know, if you're busy, we understand. +
I tell you what, let me just make a quick phone call, okay? +
That night, Miranda finally got her validation. +
Her shrink had suggested she come three times a week. +
I didn't see Mr. Big for eight days. +
Well, that was a great meal. +
Yeah, it was. +
Actually, the food was terrible +
and we were both talking to each other like strangers. +
What is wrong? +
Look. +
You tell me you have an ex-wife, +
you tell me you guys had a three-way. +
Yes, I asked. +
But you drop this big bomb, +
and you don't even give me any details. +
You don't even tell me why you broke up. +
I cheated on her. +
Yeah, I know, she told me at lunch. +
I know you know. She told me she told you. +
-She told you? -She told me. +
See that's another thing. +
You didn't tell me that you're still talking to her. +
I still talk to all my ex-wives. +
I'm so not finding that funny. +
Oh, come-- Listen, wait a minute. +
You know, the reason we had the threesome +
is because we were both looking +
for something or someone else. +
Do you know anyone who's right for me? Mmm? +
♪ I know how tricky things can be ♪ +
♪ But I really do believe that... ♪ +
And then it was just the two of us. +
And I realized the real appeal of the threesome, +
it was easy. +
It's intimacy that's the bitch. +
♪ Listen here ♪ +
♪ Some things are meant to be ♪ +
♪ Tried to take it slow ♪ +
♪ Tried to lose control... ♪ +
