'''

The island of Manhattan is a cozy village +
populated by more than seven million fascinating individuals +
who all behave like they own the sidewalk. +
But lately, it seemed as if the entire city +
had been magically reduced to only two people... us. +
Four-hour conversations flew by in a space of 15 minutes, +
and a few days apart felt like weeks. +
I realized that Einstein's law of relativity +
would have to be amended to include a special set of rules, +
those to explain the peculiar effects of infatuation. +
-Hello? Hi! +
I'm trying to get hold of a Miss Carrie Bradshaw. +
She used to be a friend of mine. +
Ha. Good morning. +
Wait, I think I recognize that voice. +
God, I can't believe it's been so long. +
I've been meaning to call you. I've just been-- +
Fucking your brains out? +
Yeah, well, that's the least of it. +
You know what? I don't think +
that I have been hit this hard since... +
No, you know what? I'm not gonna compare it to anything else +
because everything else has always ended. +
So will I actually get to see you sometime? +
Yeah, absolutely. How about tonight? +
Yeah, tonight'll work. +
All right, so I'll call Charlotte and Samantha +
and see if they're free, 'cause Big's got this dinner thing so, +
we didn't have any plans anyway-- +
God, would you listen to yourself? +
Yeah, I know. +
I've become one of those women we hate. +
Yes, you have. +
I can't talk now. I'll call you later. +
-Okay? -All right, bye. +
As I hung up, +
I realized I'd committed the cardinal sin... +
I'd forsaken my girlfriends for my new boyfriend. +
That night, I faced the tribunal. +
We really weren't that concerned. +
Just completely hurt and offended. +
Actually, you missed a lot. +
I know, I am trying to... +
Miranda had worked on a big successful merger. +
Samantha was obsessed with the idea of a new apartment. +
And Charlotte, +
Charlotte was practically engaged. +
They met the day after I dropped off the edge of the earth. +
His name was Michael Conway. +
He was from a good New York family, +
and he absolutely adored Charlotte. +
I think this might be it. +
I think this might be the one. +
We've met him. He's perfect. +
Even his fucking dog is perfect. +
But... there is one thing. +
Last night, after Michael took Charlotte to the Philharmonic, +
they went back to his place +
and began the classic dating ritual, +
the blow job tug of war. +
Oh, come on. +
Not tonight. +
When? +
Mm... sometime. +
The truth is, I hate doing it. +
Honey, you can't be serious. +
Are you telling us you never perform this act? +
She'll juggle, she'll spin plates, but she won't give head. +
I don't like putting it in my mouth. +
I have a very sensitive gag reflex +
and it makes me want to puke. +
That's one way to say no. +
It's not like I haven't tried. I practiced on a banana. +
I pretended it was a Popsicle but... +
I just don't like it. +
Personally, I'm loving it, +
up to the point where the guy wants me to swallow. +
Well, that's just really a judgment call. +
Some men just take it so personally if you don't. +
Some guys don't give you a choice. +
Well, that's just bad behavior. +
Are you honestly telling me you like it? +
Well, it's not my favorite thing on the menu, +
but, you know, I'll order it from time to time, +
and with the right guy, +
it can be nice. +
Oral sex is like God's gift to women. +
You can get off without worrying about getting pregnant. +
Plus the sense of power is such a turn-on. +
Maybe you're on your knees, but you got him by the balls. +
Now you see, that is the reason +
that I don't want to go down this road. +
Sweetheart, if you're gonna get all choked up about it... +
Just don't do it, don't do it. +
But if you don't go down on him, +
how can you expect him to go down on you? +
I don't. +
Oh, well, forget it! +
I only give head to get head. +
Me, too. +
A few hours and a couple of bottles of Pinot Grigio later, +
vows of friendship renewed, +
we were almost out the door when... +
Hey, isn't that Mr. Big? +
Yeah. +
Oh, I'm gonna go over and say hi. +
Ditching us now would be really bad form. +
I'm not gonna ditch you. +
Surprise. +
Hey, Carrie! +
-How are you? -Good, good. +
I was just here with my posse having dinner, +
and I saw you. +
Oh, Carrie, +
this is Julia Woods. +
-Julia, Carrie Bradshaw. -Let's go. +
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. +
Um, can I talk to you for a second? +
Sure. +
-Excuse me. Mm-hmm. +
Are you on a date? +
Sort of. +
I thought you said you had a business thing tonight. +
I said "a dinner thing." +
Well, she's stunning, +
and I should know because frankly, she stunned me. +
Well, enjoy your dinner. +
Are you okay? +
Oh, sure, sure, I was just, you know, +
I just didn't realize you were dating other women. +
-Well, not a lot of other women. -Oh. +
Why don't we talk about this Saturday? +
Sure, sure, sure. +
So, um, then, enjoy your dinner. +
Oh, already said that, well, enjoy it twice. +
All right, here we go. +
I can't believe it. He's seeing other women. +
Prick. +
True, we had never discussed exclusivity. +
But while for me the idea of seeing another man +
would be like trying to fit another outfit +
into an already overstuffed suitcase, +
Big was happily dating another woman +
like it was the most natural thing in the world. +
Is it that men have an innate aversion to monogamy, +
or is it more than that? +
I wondered. +
In a city like New York, +
with its infinite possibilities, +
has monogamy become too much to expect? +
I've been involved in a monogamous relationship +
for over a year now. +
It's been wonderfully fulfilling. +
Of course, my definition of monogamy +
includes sex with prostitutes. +
The problem with monogamy, +
it's just so incredibly dull. +
My lover and I have a kind of '90s monogamy. +
We have sex with other people, +
but we don't exchange fluids or phone numbers. +
Hello. +
Monogamy is fabulous. +
It gives you a deep and profound connection to another human being +
and you don't have to shave your legs as much. +
Of course, I'm monogamous. +
Why, what have you heard? +
This is the C-line. +
This is the best in the building. +
Have you ever seen any place like this? +
Is this to die? +
It's nice. +
Hold this. +
Just a second. +
Excuse me. +
Excuse me, was someone looking for a view? +
Oh, Pamela, it's beautiful, +
but it's a little out of my price-- +
I know, I know, so sue me. +
I just love to show the crème de la crème. +
I will break my ass for you, sweetheart. +
I just want to ask you for one small favor in return. +
My first born? +
No, sweetheart, I don't even want my own kids. +
Promise me that you won't work with any other broker. +
Of course! +
Samantha didn't believe in monogamy, +
especially when it came to real estate agents. +
This is a pre-war six. +
Notice the classic lines. +
Very solidly built. +
Although Pamela had the hottest contacts in town, +
Rick did have a slight competitive edge. +
He gave Samantha the opportunity +
to combine her two greatest loves, +
sex and real estate. +
That afternoon, I dragged my poor tortured soul +
out to lunch with Stanford Blatch, +
and attempted to stun it senseless with Cosmopolitans. +
Here you go. +
Monogamy is on the way out again. +
It had a brief comeback in the '90s, +
but as the millennium approaches, +
everyone's leaving their options open. +
Come on, you wouldn't commit to a nice guy given the option? +
I can't even commit to a long-distance carrier. +
You know what you are? You're a whore. +
I wish that were true. +
Hey, Stanford. +
Hey, Jared, how are you? +
My book just got a kick-ass review in Entertainment Weekly . +
How marvelous. +
Oh, Jared, have you met Carrie Bradshaw? +
No, but I've read your column. +
-Nice shit. Thanks. +
You should write about me sometime. +
My life is so fucked up right now. +
Oh, Carrie, +
Jared is the writer of the book Avenue B , +
and New York Magazine just named him +
one of the 30 coolest people under 30 in the city. +
Wow, what an honor. +
You know, if they were doing the 30 sexiest women under 30, +
I'm sure you'd go right to the top of the list. +
You're quite the storyteller, aren't you? +
That's no lie. +
The magazine's throwing us a party tomorrow night at Luna. +
I'll be sure and put your names at the door. +
Oh, thanks. +
So you'll be there? +
I'll do my best. +
Groovy. +
Ciao. +
What was happening to me? +
I used to get a secret rush from men who hit on me +
during their 15 minutes of fame. +
In this case, it merely felt exhausting. +
Hello. +
Well, hello. +
Oh, hi. +
I'm just calling to confirm tomorrow night. +
Are we still on? +
Yeah, of course, we are. Why wouldn't we be? +
I was striving for noncommittal, +
but I was worried I had just bordered on shrill. +
I'll pick you up at 8:00. +
Um, yeah, 8:00's fine. +
I miss you, baby. +
Yeah, me too. +
There were so many questions I wanted him to answer, +
but would not ask. +
Not tonight at least. +
No, tonight, I would ask Miranda. +
He said, "I miss you, baby." +
Do you think that was meant to be some kind of coded mea culpa? +
You mean like what he really meant was, +
"I've been a complete idiot, please forgive me +
for having dinner with that other woman"? +
-Yeah, exactly. -Could be. +
Well, no, because that would mean that everything that he ever said +
that I interpreted as sincere is subject to interpretation. +
In that case, what I perceive as his feelings for me +
may only really be reflected projections of my feelings for him. +
What? +
Oh, God, I'm freaking. I gotta stop. +
Gotta stop. +
Hey, Carrie! +
Oh! Hey! +
Hey, you guys, great to see you. +
What are you up to? +
Um, just hanging. +
Oh, hey, Alison, this is Miranda and Carrie. +
Miranda and Carrie, this is Alison. +
-Hello. -Hi. Nice to meet you. +
-I've heard so much about you. -Oh, me too. +
We're all such big fans of your column over at Vogue . +
You work at Vogue ? +
Yeah, designer relations. +
Skipper and I just had the most incredible meal. +
Oh, it's this little hole in the wall. +
This darling French bistro, that I am telling you, +
I lived a year in Paris and never ate so well, +
-and cheap. -Really? +
Go quick before The Times destroys it with a rave. +
Okay. +
Anyway, it's great to see you guys. +
Yeah, great meeting you. +
-You too. -Good night. +
Bye! +
Who was that self-important bitch? +
I think that was Skipper's new girlfriend. +
Well, she seemed all right. +
I didn't think that was his type. +
Well, that's true, Miranda. You're his type. +
But you broke up with him, remember? +
Something looks different. +
Has he been working out? +
Hey, Skipper here. Leave me a message. +
Hi, Skipper. It's Miranda. +
Um, I just wanted to say it was great running into you today, +
and, uh... +
you looked great. +
Did you do something different to your hair? +
Hello? Miranda. +
Hey, I can't talk right now. +
That's okay. +
I just wanted to say maybe, you know, +
I thought we could have dinner some night. +
Seriously? +
Yeah, I miss you. +
I'll call you later. +
Is everything okay? +
Uh, Alison, um, I think you're great, +
and, uh... +
But I've gotta be totally honest with you. +
The woman who I think I love just called +
and asked me back. +
You're breaking up with me while you're still inside of me? +
As Skipper rededicated his singular affection for Miranda, +
Charlotte was receiving her own declaration of monogamy. +
What do you think about +
not seeing anyone else but each other? +
Really? +
Yeah. +
That might be a good idea. +
I think it's the best idea I've ever had in my life. +
Well, in that case, absolutely. +
And while Charlotte embraced fidelity, +
and Samantha flaunted her infidelity... +
I found myself caught somewhere in between. +
So who's very crowded apartment are we in? +
Max. He's an old friend of mine. +
And remember, Becky is his second wife. +
She's a doll. You'll love her. +
Hey, there, stranger. +
Melissa. +
This is Carrie Bradshaw. +
Hi, love your column. Never miss it. +
-Oh, wow, thanks. -I've been trying to call you. +
-Ah, yeah, you know-- -You still have my passport. +
She's a friend I once traveled with. +
Internationally, I would imagine. +
-Let's find Max. -Mm-hmm. +
Hey, Max! +
Excuse me. Hey! Excuse me. +
-Hey. -Glad you could make it. +
Max, I want you to meet someone very special. +
Julia. +
Actually, it's Carrie. +
Carrie! Well, welcome. +
Carrie writes this fantastic column in The New York Star . +
It's called "Sex and the City." +
Well, if you're looking for material, you're dating the right man. +
Uh, thank you, Max. Thank you very much. +
Are we dating? +
I thought we were just sleeping together. +
Oh, well, I'm sure after tonight, +
we won't be doing much of either. +
Excuse me. +
I'll be right back. +
Carrie. +
You've got to be kidding. +
How many women are you dating? +
In the tristate area? +
Well, let's see, there's me, um, Julia. +
Oh, and let's not forget international Melissa. +
Carrie, I'm not doing this here. +
Fine. +
Can we just enjoy the party? +
I don't know. +
Come on, I mean, what do you want from me? +
What do I want from you? +
Nothing. +
I don't want anything from you. +
I have to go, I'm sorry. +
I felt like a fool. +
I had gone so far out +
on a limb with my feelings +
that I didn't realize I was standing out there alone. +
When life gets this confusing, +
sometimes there's only one thing to do, +
attend a fabulous party. +
Hey, Stanford. +
Carrie! What a surprise! +
-Where's, um-- -Oh, don't ask. +
What happened? +
He became predictable. +
How predictable? +
Hey, you made it. +
Hey, Jared. +
I'll get you a drink. +
Cosmopolitan. Thanks. +
In a room where everyone was gorgeous, cool, and under 30, +
monogamy suddenly began to seem like a quaint notion. +
God, that was like so great. +
Mm-hmm. +
Don't you just want to lie like this forever? +
Well, for a few minutes anyway. +
I missed you. +
And I want you to know that that other woman +
doesn't mean a thing to me. +
Oh, that's all right. +
I don't mind if you keep seeing her. +
Oh, God, no. +
I broke up with her the second that you called. +
Skipper, you didn't have to do that. +
Of course, I did. +
I was so happy to hear from you +
that we were still doing it while I was talking to you +
and I didn't even realize it. +
You're kidding, right? +
No. Isn't that crazy? +
Yeah, that's exactly what it is, crazy. +
Listen, Skipper, +
I'm not ready for a full-blown relationship thing. +
What? +
I mean, we can see each other +
and still see other people, right? +
No, no, we can't. +
At least, I can't. +
Why did you call me back anyway? +
I'm-- I'm sorry, I thought... +
I-- I'm not your private stud horse, you know. +
Miss dial-a-fuck. +
-Come here. -You know... +
Come back. +
I'm tired of being jerked around. +
I hope you find what you're looking for. +
While Miranda misjudged the intensity of Skipper's feelings, +
Michael left Charlotte no doubt about his. +
You're amazing. +
You've got everything I'm looking for, +
and I've never found before in one woman. +
Brains, taste, class... +
And you're very, very, sexy. +
Thank you. +
What's the problem? +
I hate doing it. +
You hate giving blow jobs? +
It's not that big of a deal, is it? +
Well, sort of. +
Can't you just do it for me? +
Would you really want me to do something that I didn't want to do? +
You'll get used to it. +
No, I won't. +
I never have. Sorry. +
Well, I plan on getting a lot of blow jobs in the future, +
and I'm hoping that you're around when I get them. +
What's that supposed to mean? +
It means I'll have to find them somewhere else. +
You're telling me +
that you would give up a woman who really cares for you, +
who would share your hopes and your fears, +
and your dreams, +
the future possible mother of your children, +
all for a blow job? +
You're right. +
Will you at least lick my balls? +
Goodbye, Michael. +
Michael was upset, but Butterscotch seemed pleased. +
She was finally back in her monogamous relationship. +
Half past midnight in a city that never sleeps, +
neither did the real estate market. +
It's beautiful. +
Isn't it? +
It went on the market at midnight +
and you're the first one to see it. +
Two bedrooms, pre-war, +
fireplace and views. +
Everything you wanted. +
I love it. I really love it. +
I knew you would. +
Let's celebrate. +
Oh, my God. +
I can't believe that you are working with another broker. +
I can't believe you weren't gonna show me this apartment. +
2:00 a.m. and I already had a new man in my life. +
You know, the greatest thing about writing a successful book, +
besides the validation, the acclaim, +
is knowing that I'm pumping my ideas into the world. +
I thought it was the fact that you could behave like an utter asshole +
and people would find you amusing. +
I'm like in love with you. You know that? +
I'm like fucking in love with you. +
Will you go home with me tonight? +
Give me a minute. I just have to make a call. +
Hello. +
I just wanted to let you know +
that I'm at this very cool party +
for very cool people under 30 +
and this very cool novelist wants to take me home. +
What? What the hell happened to you? +
His name is Jared. +
He's really cute, and really successful, +
and he just put his arms around me. +
Here, say hello, Jared. +
Hello, Jared. +
That was Jared. +
Carrie, just get over here. +
No, you get over here. +
I can't. I don't know where you are. +
I'm at the Luna Park Cafe. Just meet me out front. +
Your name's not on the list. +
Forty-five minutes later, +
I realized I was alone in a park at 3:00 a.m. +
And that it was time to call it a night. +
What are you doing back here? You said to meet out front. +
This is the front. +
This isn't the front. This is the back. +
I've been waiting out front for 30 goddamn minutes. +
You see those doors? That's the front. +
You were waiting at the street entrance. +
The street entrance is the front entrance. +
Depending on where you're coming from. +
Okay. +
I'm here. Now, what's going on? +
I've done the merry-go-round. +
I've been through the revolving door. +
I feel like I met somebody +
I can stand still with for a minute and... +
Don't you want to stand still with me? +
You dragged me out to a park at 3:00 in the morning +
to ask me if I want to stand still with you? +
Yes. +
In a city of infinite options, +
sometimes there's no better feeling +
than knowing you only have one. +

\N我会努力帮你谈谈看 但你得帮我一个忙 +
\N把我的长子过继给你？ +
\N不﹐我连自己的孩子都不想养 +
