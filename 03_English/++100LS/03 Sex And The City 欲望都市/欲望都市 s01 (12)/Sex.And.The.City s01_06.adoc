Two weeks ago, I had my picture taken. +
Look up. Good, good. +
It was a promotional photo for my column, +
scheduled to run on the side of a bus. +
I had misgivings. +
Which were somewhat mollified +
when they told me I could keep the dress. +
Friday night. +
In lieu of any actual social life of their own, +
Samantha, Miranda, and Charlotte +
had all stopped by +
to live vicariously through my first official date +
with Mr. Big. +
Carrie! +
Oh, honey, it's fabulous. +
Bravo! +
It's tits on toast, baby. But you make it work. +
-Well, let's just say it, +
it's the "naked dress." +
I mean, you're obviously gonna have sex with him tonight. +
Come on, it's our first date! +
She's not gonna have sex. +
She's just gonna look like sex. +
That's right, I'm just the trailer. +
Please, if it happens, it happens. +
Bottoms up. -Wait a second. +
Ooh... +
I thought you were serious about this guy. You can't +
sleep with him on the first date. +
Oh, God, here she goes again with "the rules." +
The women who wrote that book, +
they wrote it because they couldn't get laid. +
So they constructed this whole bullshit theory +
to make women who can get laid feel bad. +
But if you're serious about a guy, +
then you have to keep him in a holding pattern +
for at least five dates. +
Oh, you've gone up. +
Yes, because the number of dates +
that you wait to have sex with a man +
is directly proportional to your age. +
Forget the math. +
Just don't fuck on a first date, you're fine. +
-Third date. -Too soon! +
Reality check. +
A guy can just as easily dump you +
if you fuck him on the first date +
as he can if you wait until the 10th! +
When have you ever +
been on a 10th date? +
And by then at least you're emotionally involved. +
Exactly. I mean, +
isn't it better to find out if the sex +
is good right off the bat, +
before anybody's feelings get hurt? +
But it's okay to have hurt feelings. +
And you always handle those so well. +
Well, there is something to be said for restraint. +
When did you become such a Victorian? +
The Victorians were on to something. +
They valued romance. +
True romance cannot exist without good sex. +
And yet you can have good sex with someone +
you don't like or respect. +
Or even remember. +
Alright, well, ladies, I'm just going to dinner. +
Goodnight. +
Bye, have fun. +
Bye. +
The truth is, I was dying to sleep with him. +
But isn't delayed gratification +
the definition of maturity? +
Interesting dress. +
Meaning? +
Interesting dress. +
Don't worry. I'm perfectly capable of restraining myself. +
So am I. +
I can't be hemmed in by rules. +
I go with my emotions. +
I mean, some of the greatest romances of all time +
began with sex on the first date... +
I bet. +
I will not be the first one to speak. +
And if he never calls me again, +
I'll always think of him fondly... +
As an asshole. +
That was really... +
I mean, can you believe we, on the first date? +
I mean, I didn't plan that, you know. I... +
What do you think? +
Well... +
-Oh... +
Uh, I thought it was pretty fucking great. +
But what do I know? +
You feel like having some Szechuan? +
Had Mr. Big discovered my weakness +
for great sex and greasy Chinese? +
Or was going out to dinner +
simply a diversionary tactic to keep me +
from spending the night? +
Before I was able to completely indulge my paranoia... +
It was my pal, Mike Singer. +
We've known each other for ten years, +
but never had sex, +
because we want to know each other for another ten years. +
Hey! +
Carrie, what are you doing here? +
-Well, I'm with, umm... -Oh, that's him. +
No, no, I'll tell you all about it later. I'll tell you later. +
-You look great. +
-Not too naked? -Uh... +
Just naked enough. +
Hmm... +
Hi, I'm Carrie Bradshaw. +
I'm an old friend of Mike's. +
I'm Libby Biyalick. +
It's so nice to finally meet a friend. +
So, I'll call you. +
Okay, great. Well, have a good dinner. +
Nice to meet you. +
I left the table wondering why +
Mike didn't want to introduce me to his date. +
Jab, cross! Again! Jab, cross! +
That very same night, +
something absolutely amazing happened to Miranda. +
Come on! Jab, cross, kick! +
Oh my God, oh my God! I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean-- +
She met someone in gym class. +
Are you...? Oh, God. +
Are you sure you're okay? +
I'm fine, really. +
So, what exactly about my head pissed you off? +
I wish there was something I could do. +
Well, you could buy me dinner sometime. +
-And a CAT scan. +
His name was Ted Baker. +
He was 32 years old, a sports medicine doctor +
with an apartment overlooking the Natural History Museum. +
Three prior serious relationships, +
none resulting in marriage. +
A kiss to make it better. +
So, really, can I call you sometime? +
Sure. +
He left a message on my machine when I got home. +
He wants to go out this week. +
Hey, that's fantastic! +
No, it's too quick. +
I think maybe that kick in his head scrambled his brains. +
No, too quick is sleeping with him on the first date. That's too quick. +
You both got excited and you went for it. +
Stop blaming yourself. +
No, I don't blame myself. +
-I blame the dress, the dress. +
The dress led me on, it had a life of its own. +
Oh, then we went to this Chinese restaurant afterwards, +
and you'll never guess who I ran into. +
-Who? -Mike Singer, out on a date. +
The whole world's in love. +
Oh. I'm not sure, I don't know. He was acting +
very weird. Like, he, uh... +
like he didn't want me to meet her or something. +
What's her name? +
Her name was Libby Biyalick. +
Mike told me everything that afternoon, +
while I helped him pick out sheets +
at Bed Bath & Beyond. +
So, how long have you been seeing her? +
A while. +
-Is this a painful topic? +
No, it's just, she's not someone I date openly. +
Why, is she married? +
No. +
Is she a cousin? +
No. +
Look, the thing is, she's smart, +
she's incredibly sweet, and the sex is great. +
Well, she's just not the one I see myself with. +
Why not? +
It was about three months ago. +
Mike had been dumped by Fiona Brooks, +
a cellist for the Philharmonic, +
who he was trying to forget as quickly as possible. +
They had both loved to cook, +
and shopping for the week was a Saturday morning ritual. +
So he was feeling particularly vulnerable when... +
Care to try some aged sheep's milk cheese +
from the Tyrolean Alps? +
Thanks. +
Mmm, it's good. +
It's made by monks. +
-Really? -Trappist monks. +
Fresh goat cheese from the Napa Valley. +
It's delicious. +
L'explorateur. +
It's a triple cr√®me from France. +
Mike found himself very uninhibited. +
Since he didn't think Libby was that gorgeous, +
there wasn't any pressure. +
The next morning, he woke up and felt at ease, +
very relaxed. +
I'm a creative director of an ad agency, +
but eventually I'd love to have my own shop. +
I'd love to have my own shop, too. +
Well, cheese shop, I mean. +
She was one of the only women he'd ever met +
who he felt he could just be with. +
So what's the problem? +
Look, she's not beautiful, +
and we don't have a lot in common. +
I mean, you know, most of her friends are in dairy. +
But she's warm, and unpretentious, +
and it is the best sex I've ever had in my life. +
What are you afraid of? What other people are going to think? +
Look, all I know is that +
she's not the right woman for me in the larger sense. +
So I keep her a secret. +
I couldn't decide whether Mike was being +
shallow or honest. +
But the question nagged me for days. +
How many of us out there are having great sex +
with people we're ashamed to introduce to our friends? +
Have I ever had fabulous sex with someone +
I didn't want to admit to? Hmm... +
Mm. Did I ever tell you about that jazz musician +
who lived with his mother in Queens? +
Yeah, Alex. +
What about the window washer? +
The one who doesn't wear any underwear? +
I met this gorgeous kid in Spy Bar last year. +
He turned out to be in high school. +
Evidently, Samantha had had lots of sex, +
none of which was secret. +
Fine, it just proves that I'm not ashamed of anyone +
who I've slept with. +
Okay, here it is. +
Up here. +
Oh, you look-- +
Naked. +
There it was, +
the dress that lead me down +
the garden path with Mr. Big. +
I shouldn't be embarrassed? +
No, you look fabulous! +
Besides, there's no such thing as bad publicity. +
Yeah. You would say that, you're a publicist. +
You know, we need to go someplace absolutely fabulous +
where we can toast you, where the bus goes by. +
And you can invite Mr. Big. +
No, no, I don't think so. I haven't heard from him +
since we spent the night together. +
Oh, sweetie, forget about him. +
You are going to be on the side of a bus. +
Ten million men are going to be drooling over you +
every morning on their way to work. +
It's the best personal ad I've ever seen in my life. +
Samantha had a particular knack +
for turning a desperate situation into a hopeless one. +
Oh, speaking of secret sex, +
did Charlotte ever tell you about the rabbi? +
The rabbi? +
Excuse me? +
You know who I'm talking about. +
I cannot believe that the two of you came down here +
to interrogate me at work! +
I'm sorry, it's my fault. +
Anyway, he wasn't a rabbi. +
He was a Hasidic folk artist from Brooklyn. +
Close enough. +
Evidently, Charlotte had seen Shmuel's work +
in an exhibition, +
and scheduled an appointment to meet him at his studio. +
These are outstanding, so much life. +
You have a beautiful way with light. +
Thank you. +
Now this one is really special. +
That's my Yeshiva. +
I wanted to capture the exuberance of youth. +
Charlotte quickly became intoxicated by his talent, +
his strangeness and the smell of his wool. +
Magical. +
It was so sexy, so forbidden. +
Daddy's little Episcopalian princess +
in the arms of one of God's chosen people. +
We would talk about art and sex and the Torah. +
Well, why didn't you introduce him to anybody? +
I was embarrassed. +
I mean, I couldn't really date him. +
And he couldn't date me. +
I mean, what would people think? +
If the sex is good, who cares what anybody thinks? +
Now you cannot put this in your column. Promise? +
I promise. +
Was secret sex the ultimate form of intimacy, +
since it existed in a pure state, +
exempt from the judgment of the world? +
Or is it just another way in which we deny our feelings +
and emotionally compartmentalize our lives? +
Hello? +
Do you miss me yet? +
Who is this? +
How've you been? +
Oh, great. +
Fabulous, fantastic actually, and you? +
Well, at the risk of sounding trite... +
I haven't been able to stop thinking about you. +
I adore trite. +
Listen, we should have a real first date. +
You know, the traditional American type. +
Dinner and a movie. +
Of course, knowing us, we'll skip the movie. +
Just as long as we don't skip dinner. +
What a relief. +
I had just escaped the sex on the first date curse. +
Whew! +
That weekend, I was out with a man whose name +
I wanted to shout from the rooftops. +
Let me get this straight, +
your picture is going to be on a bus? +
That's right. +
A cross town bus, or a downtown bus? +
The M2. It goes right down Fifth. +
That's a good line. +
I'm getting together a group of my friends +
tomorrow afternoon to watch it go by. +
I thought, maybe if you weren't doing anything-- +
Hey, how are you? +
Hey, how are you? It's good to see you. +
-You remember Phyllis. -Of course, Phyllis. +
-How are you? -Everything good? +
Yeah, everything's dandy. +
Well, that's what I hear. +
-So, uh, good to see you. -Good to see you again. +
-Good seeing you. -Bye-bye, cheers. +
-Who was that? -Just some guy +
I skied with in Aspen. +
I didn't understand. +
Had I suddenly become the invisible woman? +
I tried not to let it bother me. +
I also tried not to let it bother me +
that he took me back to Fung Wa, +
scene of our post-coital dinner. +
Oh, I can't make your party tomorrow. +
Oh, no. +
I wanted to introduce you to some of my friends. +
Well, I'll be home later if you miss me. +
As I surveyed the room, +
I realized it smelled like a cheap date +
you don't want anyone to meet. +
I told Mr. Big I was on a deadline +
and I had to get home. +
-Hello? -Listen, I have a question. +
Of all the restaurants in Manhattan, +
why did you take Libby to Fung Wa? +
Well, it's pretty obscure. +
Not much of a chance of running into anybody I know. +
So, you mean it's the kind of a place +
that men take women they don't want to be seen with in public? +
Yes, it is perfect for that. +
Oh, sorry. +
The evidence was mounting. +
Was it possible that I had become +
Mr. Big's secret sex girl? +
The next morning, +
Miranda discovered a shocking sex secret of her own. +
She had just spent a wonderful night with Ted, +
who had to leave early in the morning +
to catch a flight to D.C. for a spinal conference. +
I can go home, it's no big deal. +
No, stay, it's 6:00 a.m. +
I'll be back tonight. Want to do something? +
-I'd love to. -Alright, I'll call you at work. +
Have a good flight. +
Miranda waited for the dead bolt to drop, +
and then used the opportunity to ransack Ted's apartment +
and look for pictures of old girlfriends. +
She was not at all prepared for what she found. +
Yeah? Do you feel your cock where it wants to e every night? +
Every single night when you come home +
and everything's done in the house +
and I've been doing it all day long... +
I don't know what to do. +
I can't admit to having found this, +
but now I don't know if I want to see him again. +
How can you judge him until you spank him? +
I'm only kidding. +
But, I mean, obviously this is what he's into. +
Maybe it's just his fantasy life. +
Later that day, +
the cream of New York gathered to toast +
the maiden voyage of my bus. +
Where's Mr. Big? +
Oh, he couldn't make it. +
What do you mean he couldn't make it? +
I don't know, it's a work thing. +
Oh, but this is your bus party! +
Oh, I told you, you shouldn't have... +
Well, never mind. +
What, he's not here because I slept with him on the first date? +
Basically, yes. When you sleep with a man on the first date, +
the relationship will never be anything more than just sex. +
-Uh-huh. Okay, thank you. +
-Cheers! -Cheers! +
I didn't want to admit that she was right. +
Ah, here it comes, here it comes! +
I just wanted to see my bus and get the hell out of there. +
-Oh, shit. Carrie! +
-Hi, did I miss it? -Hey! Hi. +
Not yet, no. +
Hey, I thought you were going to bring Libby... +
Oh, yeah. I finally asked her to join me in public +
and she turns me down. +
Why? +
She told me that she met somebody else +
who doesn't have my problems with intimacy. +
Oh, I'm sorry. +
Uh! Quiet, +
here you come! +
Ohh... +
Aw, don't worry, sweetie, don't worry. Eh... +
Nobody in New York notices a bus +
until it's about to hit them. +
That's right. +
Meanwhile, +
Miranda spent another wonderful evening with Ted +
and began to re-evaluate her options. +
That was one of the most amazing meals +
I have ever had. Thank you. +
My pleasure. +
You know, I missed you today. +
-You did? +
I guess I've just been waiting all this time +
for a good kick in the head. +
And here I thought that all you really wanted +
was a good spanking. +
Excuse me? +
You heard me. +
Oh. +
Ted didn't take Miranda home that night. +
He never took her calls or returned her messages. +
And she never saw him at the gym again. +
Very late that night, +
fueled by a massive quantity of champagne, +
I decided to say goodbye to Mr. Big. +
I just came here to tell you that +
if you're embarrassed or ashamed +
to be involved with me in any way, +
that we can no longer see each other. +
The truth is, I blamed myself. +
I wore the naked dress on our first date, +
I slept with him too fast, +
and now I'm on a Fifth Avenue bus with a penis on my head. +
What are you talking about? +
You won't introduce me to your friends, +
you bring me back to that restaurant +
where men take women they don't want to be seen with, +
you won't come out and meet my friends. +
You have me in a niche. +
Certain events, certain restaurants, +
certain people. +
Like I'm only a particular fragment of the kind of person +
you think that you should be dating. +
But I've only gotten to know a particular fragment. +
Although, I'm beginning to know more. +
No, this is not me. +
This is me reacting to your perception of me. +
Oh, okay. +
Well... +
I think Fung Wa's is +
the best Chinese food +
in the city, so that's why we went there. +
And, uh... +
Oh... The guy we met in the street, +
I couldn't remember his name, +
which possibly means I have Alzheimer's. +
So that's what that was about. +
And this afternoon I had courtside tickets +
to the Knicks, +
and that's all folks! +
I should have been jumping for joy, +
but I only felt a hard knot of fear. +
So you and me... +
Then maybe this is for real? +
Could be... +
