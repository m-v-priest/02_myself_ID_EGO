'''

Let's be honest. +
Sometimes there is nothing harder in life +
than being happy for somebody else. +
Like lottery winners +
or extremely successful people who are twenty-seven. +
And then there's that hell on earth +
that only your closest friends can inflict on you. +
The baby shower. +
You could not drag me to that thing +
if you put a grappling hook in my mouth. +
Frankly, I think it's sad. +
The way she's using a child to validate her existence. +
Exactly. +
Why can't she just use sex +
and a nice cocktail like the rest of us? +
I'm happy for her. I am. +
If I see another crepe paper stork, +
I'm gonna rip its cardboard beak off. +
Can I ask you... +
would any baby shower bother you +
or is this one worse because it's Laney's? +
Laney Berlin. +
You can't really describe he. +
You just had to know her. +
Chances are eight years ago, you probably did. +
So help me. +
She fucks on my couch, +
she buys it. +
Isn't that how you got the couch from me? +
Hey, Laney, show us your tits! +
Oh, give it a rest. +
You guys have seen enough of my tits. +
Laney did A&R for a record label, +
or as she used to call it, sex with an expense account. +
Every time she went on a scouting trip, +
she came back with some hot new group +
and a gynecological condition no one had ever heard of. +
Those things make so many public appearances, +
they need a booking agent. +
Look at her. +
The poster girl for low self-esteem. +
You know, I have low self-esteem but I express it the healthy way +
by eating a box of Double Stuf Oreos. +
She's so sad. +
Take it off! +
Samantha and Laney had a long standing rivalry. +
Both wild, both sexy. +
Both incredibly insecure. +
Two years ago, Laney did the most shocking thing of all. +
She met a Wall Street investment banker, +
married him and moved to Connecticut. +
That wasn't supposed to happen. +
She was supposed to have sex with Sid Vicious +
and move to heroin. +
Come on, you guys, it'll be fun. +
We've never even been to visit her in Connecticut. +
Exactly. There's a reason for that. +
-Lyme disease? -That's another good one. +
But it's a baby shower. +
No, it's a cult. +
It's a cult? What are you talking about? +
Listen to me. +
They all think the same, dress the same +
and sacrifice themselves +
babies. +
She's insane. +
Hey, I've lost two sisters to the motherhood. +
I know what I'm talking about. +
I think we should go, it's the right thing to do. +
Give me one good reason. +
Okay, +
you're driving down the road, you see a sign, +
it says, "Two-headed snake." +
You pull over. +
Wild Laney is having a baby shower, you pull over. +
She's got a point. It's the right thing to do. +
Just imagine how fat she must be. +
As I penciled in the date, +
I noticed something missing. +
In between the Versace show and dinner at Moomba, +
there it wasn't. +
My period... four days late. +
That Saturday, +
also known as seven days late, +
four city girls set off to visit the country mice. +
Are we there yet? +
I've already had two of these, +
so we're gonna be stopping a lot. +
Hey, nice outfit. +
Is there gonna be some belly dancing at the shower? +
Yeah, right after the gifts. +
Oh, shit. I totally spaced. +
I forgot to buy her a present. +
How tacky is it to give the mother to be +
a fistful of cash? +
Oh, don't worry about it. +
You can go in on mine. +
You bought a pregnant woman a bottle of scotch? +
The invitation said BYOB. +
That meant bring your own baby. +
-What did you get her? -Condoms. +
Seriously, what'd you get her? +
Seriously. +
They're pastel. +
-Oh. Hey, guys! Wait, wait! +
Hey, guys, wait for me! +
-Oh, my God. Wait! +
Look at the size of that thing. +
We can drive that to Connecticut. +
I'm putting my name on that card. +
All right. +
Go, go, go, go, go. +
Does anybody know how to drive? +
As I turned the mid-size coupe on to Holly Hock lane, +
I was struck by how a place so filled with nature +
could look so unnatural. +
Oh, Toto. +
I don't think we're in Manhattan anymore. +
Oh, her house is beautiful. +
Oh, and look at her dog. +
Hey, boy. +
Hey, boy, come here, boy. +
Come here, boy. +
Why didn't he come? +
Invisible electric fencing. +
It's the latest thing. +
My sister has it. +
Okay. +
Ready, girls? +
Let's go. +
Ooh, Charlotte, sweetie, don't forget our gift. +
Come on. +
Oh, look at you, you're huge. +
I know, isn't it great? +
I can eat anything I want. Jealous? +
-Come on in. +
Come in, come in. +
Brigid, Roxanne, these are my friends from the city. +
Hi. -We didn't think you'd make it. +
Oh, we got lost. +
We took the wrong bridge. +
Oh, remember that feeling like if you left +
Manhattan even for a second, +
you'd fall off the edge of the Earth? +
Oh, God, don't remind me. +
Hi. +
Oh, my God. +
It's the Bellini baby basket. +
Aww! +
Oh, look. +
Everybody, it's the Bellini baby basket. +
Speaking of bellini's, +
I'm gonna have a big drink. +
Jealous? +
Is she still bar hopping and bed hopping? +
It's so sad, isn't it? +
When that's all you have. +
Okay, this is Rebecca. +
-Hi. Hi. +
Susan. +
-Hello. -Hello. +
Mindy. -Hey. +
Don't get up, sweetheart. +
She's doing this in vitro thing. +
She's not supposed to move at all. +
And that's Betsy and her boy, Harry. +
They're inseparable. They do everything together. +
We call them our old married couple. +
Except it's not really that funny +
now that Betsy and her husband are getting divorced. +
Laney, we need you. +
So, all I have to do to meet the ideal man is... +
give birth to him. +
I love my son. +
Andy's eleven months old. +
He is a God and I tell him so every day. +
Thirty years from now, +
what do you think the chances are that some woman's +
gonna be able to make Andy happy? +
I'm gonna go with zero. +
Oh, it's adorable. +
Look at that Charlotte. +
Oh, I wish they made this in my size. +
I told you, it's a cult. +
We can't separate. +
Once they isolate you from the herd, it's all over. +
As I watched Laney tear open a terry cloth baby bib +
with the same enthusiasm she once reserved for tearing off +
rock stars' pants, I couldn't help but wonder... +
was I next? +
You know what, I have to pee. +
If you're not back in five minutes, I'm coming after you. +
The truth is I needed to escape. +
The party had turned into a preview, +
a preview of a life I didn't know if I was ready for. +
Even seven months pregnant, +
Laney couldn't keep her clothes on. +
Clearly a part of the old Laney had survived. +
But I wondered, what was still buried +
deep inside the mommies downstairs? +
Before I married my husband, I slept around with everybody. +
Now I have an internet lover. +
-No one knows. +
When I was senior vice president, +
212 people reported to me on a daily basis. +
Now I just yell at the gardener... +
who doesn't understand a single word. +
I'm exactly the same. +
I love my life. +
But every now and then I can't help but think about... +
Lisa. +
Sometimes I climb up into the kids' tree house +
with my walkman, +
light up a joint and listen to Peter Frampton. +
There's a woman in there breastfeeding a child +
who can chew steak. +
You know how I feel about that? +
If you can ask for it, you're probably too old to have it. +
Jeremy, no! +
I just realized, +
maybe it's maturity or the wisdom that comes with age, +
but the witch in Hansel and Gretel , +
she's very misunderstood. +
I mean, the woman builds her dream house +
and these brats come along and start eating it. +
I just have to tell you your home is beautiful. +
Thank you. +
I know it's a big change. +
But at some point you have to get serious and settle down. +
I mean, life is not a Jacqueline Susann novel. +
Four friends looking for life and love in the big city. +
No. +
Stop it. +
You are not gonna clean up at your own shower. +
Yeah, relax, 'cause once little Todd or Shayla comes around, +
you'll never stop cleaning up. +
Shayla? Did you say Shayla? +
It's so unique, isn't it? +
It's so my name. +
I thought your name was Charlotte. +
No, it's not my name. +
It's my name. +
My secret baby name that I made up when I was +
eleven years old for my daughter when I had her. +
I told you. +
Don't tell me you don't remember. +
No, I'm sorry. I-- I really don't. +
A complete lie. +
She remembered. +
We all remembered. +
Charlotte had made us all swear never to use it. +
Anyway, I think my husband heard it somewhere else. +
Really, where? Because I didn't tell him. +
I can't believe you're freaking out over a name. +
I mean, you're not even pregnant. +
That's not the point! +
What's going on? +
She stole my baby name. +
-You bitch! +
Let's go. +
Beers and bar nuts at Flanagan's off route five +
were the perfect antidote to Laney's house of humiliation. +
If I hadn't waited this long to have a baby, +
that name would be mine. +
Oh, Charlotte, come on. You're still young. +
You have plenty of time to have children. +
No, no I don't. +
I don't want to be one of those forty-year-old moms. +
No, no offense. +
Well, I don't want to be one of them either. +
There are no frozen eggs in my freezer. +
Was the bathroom clean? +
What do you think? +
This is why I hate baby showers. +
Always leave feeling depressed. +
Patty, another round. +
Well, I for one love my life and I will not be +
made to feel inadequate by all this baby talk. +
I spoke to a woman with a master's in finance. +
-All she wanted to talk about was her Diaper Genie. +
Oh, come on, you guys, it doesn't have to be like that. +
You don't have to lose yourself to have a kid. +
I know plenty of cool, hip mothers who live in the city +
and who still have great careers and stuff. +
-Who? -Who? +
I'm late. I missed my period. +
Patty, honey, where are those beers? +
How late? +
I don't know, just a few... seven days. +
Oh, honey, gray area. +
True, you're in front of the firing squad, +
but you haven't been shot. +
I was once ten days late. +
Really? +
Were you having sex? +
No. +
-What are you gonna do? +
You gonna tell Mr. Big? +
No, I am not gonna tell him until I know what I... +
Until I know how I... What-- +
No, I'm, I am not going to tell him +
until I know how to finish the sentence. +
What did I miss? +
Nothing. +
That night, Charlotte got out her wish box where she kept +
reminders of all the things she hoped for in life. +
A gift for Shayla. +
A townhouse in the city. +
A beach house in East Hampton. +
Her dream man. +
Her back-up dream man. +
It's very strange when the life you never had +
flashes before your eyes. +
Carrie held hostage, day eight. +
Miranda and I went shopping. +
I'm on total ovary overload. +
Which kind do I get? +
Here, this one's on sale. Half off. +
Sweetie, I just spent three hundred and ninety-five dollars +
on a pair of open toed Gucci's last week. +
-This is not the place to be frugal. -All right. +
Well, what about this one? +
Oh, First Response. I remember First Response. +
I had a very reassuring moment once with First Response. +
Oh. +
Here's hoping. +
Cosmetics, pick up line two. Line two, Cosmetics... +
What if I am? +
If you am, you am. +
I don't think I'd be very good at this. +
I mean, am I maternal? +
-Um... -You know, when I was a little girl, +
I left my favorite baby doll out in the rain for four days. +
Her face peeled off. +
That can't be good. +
Yeah, but, I mean, if you-- +
I shaved my Barbie's head when I was mad at her. +
When I was little, I took a rubber band +
and put it around my dog Pepper's snout. +
-What? -Oh, God. +
Can you picture it? +
Us with... +
Kids? +
Babies. +
I'll probably end up with five. +
Five hours and two packs of gum later, +
I decided I couldn't take the test +
till I knew exactly how I felt about the results. +
Either way... +
Hello. +
It's Laney. +
Oh, hi. +
I just wanted to tell you it was so great to see you guys the other day. +
I know I was a big bitch, +
but you gotta know my hormones are going wild. +
The truth is Laney's hormones have been +
going wild since she was ten. +
And seeing you made me remember how much fun we used to have. +
Yeah, we did. +
It's amazing how much time has gone by. +
Tell me about it. +
But I miss us. +
I really do. +
We should get together more often. +
Mm-hmm. +
But, I mean, we should get together. +
Not just say we're going to, but really do it. +
Absolutely. +
Listen, I've got to go. I'm running late. +
Where you off to? +
Um, actually Samantha's having one of her parties. +
-She is? -Yeah. +
Oh, man. +
See, that's the kind of thing-- I love Samantha's parties. +
Why didn't you tell me? +
Next time, I promise, all right? +
Okay, bye. +
Faced with her own inadequacy, +
Samantha did something only Samantha could do. +
She threw an "I don't have a baby" shower +
to let everyone know she was fabulous. +
Great to see you. +
Oh, I don't have a baby! +
Everybody drink! +
Are you having fun? +
Yes, I am, but not quite as much fun as Miranda. +
Still convinced that marriage plus baby equals death, +
Miranda chose life. +
Also known as Ed, Samantha's accountant. +
If she fucks on that couch, she buys it. +
Ah... +
Hey, you guys. +
The entertainment has arrived. +
What are you doing here? +
What I do best. +
Partying! +
Here, maybe we better sit down. +
Fuck no. Where's the bar? +
Somebody get me a drink! +
No, I don't know, Laney. You think that's a good idea? +
Fuck yeah, I'm due any day. +
What's one little drink gonna matter? +
Maybe it will help me go into labor. +
She gives birth on that couch, she buys it. +
What are you doing here? +
What is she doing here? +
-I missed you guys. Oh, us, us? +
The pathetic, live for the moment, +
New York single girls who think that life +
is a Jacqueline Susann novel? +
Look, I'm sure you get asked this all the time, but... +
what is your problem? +
My problem? +
Just that I had a dream and you killed it in a nutshell. +
Really? Well, then you're lucky. +
Because at least you know what happened to your dream. +
I have absolutely no idea what happened to mine. +
I spent the next hour keeping Charlotte away from Laney +
and Laney away from the vodka. +
Well, well, well, look who came up for air. +
He's a good kisser and he's gonna do my taxes for free. +
Excuse me. Sorry. +
Hey, Carrie. +
Hey, Jonathan. +
Listen, I've just been talking to your friend, Charlotte. +
She's really great. Is, um, she seeing anybody? +
Wide open. +
Just don't mention the name "Shayla." +
Sorry? +
Nothing. It's a private joke. +
Go forth... and date. +
His name was Jonathan Bicks. +
He was a trader at Bear Stearns +
and had just closed escrow on a house in the Hamptons. +
Charlotte suddenly realized all was not lost. +
As she sipped her beer, +
she mentally scotch-taped her dream house +
back together again. +
This party sucks. +
Laney, maybe we should think about getting you home, all right? +
No, I don't want to go back there. +
Hey, you fuckers! Who wants to see my tits? +
I'll take a look. +
Laney, Laney, come on, come back. Don't do this. +
Relax. This is gonna be fun. +
All right, look. Now we're gonna have a party. +
All right. Pregnant lady showing her tits! +
Whoo! +
Oh, my God. +
This is at once so sad +
and the most fabulous validation I've ever gotten in my life. +
This is weird. +
I-- I don't-- I... +
I don't think I can do this. +
No biggie. +
Despite her best efforts to run free, +
it appeared that Laney Berlin's invisible electric fence +
stretched all the way to Manhattan. +
No, no, I know I can do it. +
Just-- just give me one more chance. +
Laney, Laney, it's not who you are anymore. +
It's all right. +
But I didn't know that was gonna happen. +
No-- nobody told me that was gonna happen. +
I mean, somebody should warn you. +
All right. +
One day you're gonna wake up +
and you're not gonna recognize yourself. +
Can you take her to Connecticut? +
I spent the entire next day sitting on a park bench +
watching children play. +
If I had to, could I do this? +
Would I be any good? +
Would I somehow manage to stay me? +
Hello. +
Oh, my. +
Oh, sorry. +
That's okay. +
She's adorable. +
Yeah, most of the time. +
You want to go home? Yeah. +
Yeah, yeah. +
-Bye. Bye-bye. +
Bye. +
On the way home, I got my period. +

\N如果她们让你落单 下场就很惨 +
\N当我看着兰妮撕开棉织围兜时 +
\N脸上兴奋的表情 就像她扯开摇滚巨星裤子一样 +
\N我不禁要问 +
\N下一个会是我？ +
\N我要去洗手间 +
\N如果你五分钟内不回来 我就去找你 +

\N显然过去的兰妮还是存在的 +
\N我不禁感到好奇 这些妈咪内心究竟有何秘密？ +
\N结婚前﹐我到处和人上床 +
\N现在我有个网路情人 但没人知道这秘密 +
\N我还是资深副总裁时 每天有212位员工要向我报告 +

\N我还是一样﹐热爱我的生活 +
\N现在无时无刻我都只想到莉莎 +
\N有时我会带着随身听 爬到孩子们的树屋 +
\N点根大麻﹐听彼得费普顿的歌 +
\N喂乳的孕妇能大吃牛排 +
\N你知道我是什么感觉？ +
\N如果你想这么做 那可能也过了年纪了 +
\N杰瑞米﹐不可以 +
\N我刚恍然大悟 或许成长该伴随着成熟与智慧 +
\N但“韩森和葛莉特”童话中的 巫婆弄错了 +
\N女人建造了自己的梦幻之屋 +
\N但爱捣蛋的小鬼们 却纷纷来破坏 +
\N-你家真是漂亮 -谢谢 +
\N这是人生的重大改变 +
\N但到了某个时刻 就得认真看待人生﹐安定下来 +
\N生活可不是像贾桂琳苏珊小说 四个好友在城市中寻找真爱 +
\N住手 这是你的送礼会﹐不用自己清 +
\N对﹐放轻松 一旦陶德或夏拉出生后 +
\N-你就有得忙了 -你刚说“夏拉”？ +
\N-这名字很特殊吧？ -那是我的名字 +
\N-你应该是夏绿蒂吧？ -不﹐是我取的名字 +
\N那是我11岁时 +
\N为以后的女儿所取的名字 我告诉过你 +
\N你没告诉过我﹐我不记得了 +
\N抱歉﹐真的没有 +
\N简直是在说谎﹐她记得的 我们全都记得 +
\N夏绿蒂还要我们大家发誓 绝不能用这个名字 +
\N可能是我先生在哪儿听到的 +
\N是吗？在哪？ 我可没告诉他 +
\N-你居然会为个名字这么激动 -你根本都还没怀孕 +
\N-这不是重点 -怎么了？ +
\N-她偷了我女儿的名字 -贱货 +
\N走吧 +
\N坐在第五大道的弗兰格酒吧里 开怀畅饮 +
\N是消除在兰妮家所受屈辱的 最佳疗伤法 +
\N假如我早点生 那名字就是我的 +
\N夏绿蒂﹐你还年轻 +
\N要生孩子﹐时间多得是 +
\N才不是 我才不要当个40岁的妈妈 +
\N-没有冒犯之意 -我也不想当高龄产妇 +
\N我可能也很难怀孕 +
\N-化妆室干净吗？ -你觉得呢？ +
\N所以我才这么讨厌送礼会 参加后总是心情沮丧 +
\N派提﹐再来一巡 +
\N我可是热爱我的生活 +
\N我才不会因为这种无聊事 就觉得自己不如人 +
\N我和位财经女强人谈话时 +
\N她的话题都绕着尿布打转 +
\N根本没必要这样 不用为孩子而牺牲掉自己 +
\N我知道城里有很多时髦的辣妈 +
\N而且成功事业 +
\N谁？ +
\N-我的月事晚了 -派提﹐酒怎么还没来？ +
\N晚了多久？ +
\N-几天而已﹐一星期 -亲爱的﹐灰色地带 +
\N没错﹐你只是准备行刑 还没被枪决 +
\N-我有次晚了十天 -是吗？你有做爱？ +
\N没有 +
\N你打算怎么做？告诉大人物？ +
\N不﹐我不打算告诉他 除非我知道… +
\N我知道该怎么… +
\N除非我知道该怎么说完这句话 +
\N-我错过了什么？ -没有 +
\N当晚夏绿蒂拿出她的愿望箱 +
\N她把这一生所许过的愿望 都放在里面 +
\N给夏拉的礼物 +
\N在城里拥有一间大宅邸 在东汉普顿有间海滨别墅 +
\N白马王子 +
\N后补的白马王子 +
\N令人奇怪的是 脑中居然没有你这一生的画面 +
\N于是早上八点时 我抓了个人质米兰达去逛街 +
\N子宫好像觉得快爆掉了 我该买哪一种？ +
\N这个﹐拍卖品﹐只要半价 +
\N我上星期刚花395美元 买了双古奇的开趾凉鞋 +
\N-现在不是省钱的时刻 -好吧 +
\N这个呢？ +
\N一试就灵 +
\N我记得以前用过这牌子来覆验 +
\N以防万一 +
\N-如果我怀孕怎么办？ -就接受现实 +
\N我对这种事根本不在行 我像是具有母爱的人？ +
\N小时候我连续四天把洋娃娃 放在外面淋雨﹐弄得面目全非 +
\N-这可不是好征兆 -对﹐但… +
\N有次我很生气 还把它的头发剃光 +
\N小时候我把橡皮筋 +
\N绕在我的狗“胡椒”的 鼻子上 +
\N-怎么了？ -天啊 +
\N-你能想像那画面﹐我们有… -孩子 +
\N-怀孕 -我可能办不到 +
\N经过五个钟头 吃了两包口香糖后 +
\N我决定除非自己已作好准备 否则就不看检查结果 +
\N绝对不看 +
\N-你好 -我是兰妮 +
\N只是想告诉你 很高兴见到你们 +
\N我知道自己不对 可能是荷尔蒙作崇 +
\N事实上兰妮的贺尔蒙 从十岁起就开始作崇了 +
\N看到你们让我想起 以前快乐的时光 +
\N对﹐以前狂欢作乐的日子 +
\N还用你说 但我真的很想念大家 +
\N我们应该常聚聚 +
\N我说的是在一起聚聚 +
\N不是说说而已 而是真的找时间聚聚 +
\N-好﹐但我得走了﹐要迟到了 -你要去哪里？ +
\N-莎曼珊办了个派对 -是吗？ +
\N-对 -真好 +
\N这就是我怀念的地方 我喜欢莎曼珊的派对 +
\N-你怎么不通知我？ -下次好吗？我保证 +
\N好吧﹐再见 +
\N面对自己不如人之处 +
\N莎曼珊决定有所行动 做些她最擅长的事 +
\N她办了个 “我没有小孩”的送礼会 +
\N让大家知道她的迷人之处 +
\N很高兴见到你 我没有小孩﹐大家尽量喝 +
\N-好玩吧？ -对﹐但没米兰达那么好玩 +
\N米兰达仍然相信 有了婚姻小孩生活就无望了 +
\N她选择即时享乐 +
\N他是莎曼珊的会计师艾德 +
\N若她在沙发上搞﹐就得买下来 +
\N大家好﹐好戏上场了 +
\N-你来做什么？ -做我最擅长的事﹐狂欢 +
\N-我们还是坐下吧 -吧台在哪儿？ +
\N-给我杯饮料 -这样好吗？ +
\N反正我随时都会生 喝杯酒有什么关系？ +
\N说不定还有助于生产 +
\N她敢在沙发上生﹐就得买 +
\N你在这里做什么？ 她来这里做什么？ +
\N-我想念大家 -想念我们？ +
\N是谁说活在贾桂琳苏珊小说中 四个可悲单身女郎？ +
\N你一定常在想这个问题 但你到底哪里有问题？ +
\N我的问题？ +
\N简单说﹐就是你毁了我的梦想 +
\N是吗？那么你们可真幸运 还知道梦想的结果 +
\N我却连自己在做什么都不知道 +
\N兰妮 +
\N接下来的一个小时 我忙着把她们两个分开 +
\N也忙着帮不让兰妮 喝太多伏特加酒 +
\N看谁出现了？ +
\N他是个亲吻高手 还免费帮我报税 +
\N-对不起﹐凯莉 -你好﹐强纳森 +
\N我刚和你朋友夏绿蒂谈了很久 她真的很迷人 +
\N-她有和谁约会？ -待字闺中 +
\N-只要别提夏拉这名字就好 -对不起？ +
\N没什么﹐私人笑话 放手去追吧 +
\N他是强纳森比克斯 +
\N是位房地产商 刚成交了一笔汉普顿的房子 +
\N夏绿蒂突然觉得 她并非失去一切 +
\N当她啜饮啤酒时 +
\N脑子里已开始策划 她的梦幻之屋 +
\N这派对烂透了 +
\N兰妮﹐我送你回去吧？ +
\N不﹐我不要回去 +
\N各位﹐谁想看我的咪咪？ +
\N-我 -兰妮﹐回来﹐别这样 +
\N放轻松﹐会很好玩的 +
\N好﹐开始狂欢了 +
\N孕妇要秀她的咪咪了 +
\N天啊 +
\N我本来还以为自己很可悲 +
\N但这让我再次确认 我的生活是美好的 +
\N有点怪 +
\N我办不到 +
\N算了吧 +
\N兰妮除了想重获自由生活外 +
\N显然她的隐形电墙 +
\N也蔓延到曼哈顿了 +
\N我知道自己办得到 只要再给我次机会 +
\N你已经不是以前的你了 没关系的 +
\N但我不知道事情怎会变成这样 +
\N没人告诉会变成这样 +
\N-应该有人要警告我 -没关系 +
\N有一天当你醒来时 却再也认不出自己 +
\N麻烦载她到康涅狄格州 +
\N隔天我花了一整天 坐在公园里看着小孩玩耍 +
\N如果我有孩子 我能应付得来吗？ +
\N当个称职的妈妈？ +
\N我该如何保住自我？ +
\N你好﹐天啊 +
\N-抱歉 -没关系﹐她好可爱 +
\N对﹐大部分时间是 你要回家吗？ +
