'''

The most powerful woman in New York is not Tina Brown, +
or Diane sawyer or even Rosie O'Donnell. +
It's the hostess at Balzac, which had overnight +
become the only restaurant that mattered. +
And we were there to celebrate the moment. +
This is humiliating. +
We've been waiting for 45 minutes. +
I think I'm gonna faint. +
Doesn't she know who we are? +
Who are we? +
I own my own P.R. firm, +
you write a newspaper column. +
This should not be happening. +
I'm going back up there. +
Excuse me. Hello, excuse me. +
Hello! +
We've been waiting 45 minutes. +
Look, I'm not sure you understand, but... +
I'm kind of somebody, +
and she's definitely kind of somebody, +
and we really need to eat now. +
I'm sorry. +
Excuse me. +
Give me a twenty. +
You must be joking. +
Do you think I should make it a fifty? +
If I had 50 dollars with me, +
do you think I'd give it to that girl? +
She cannot do this to us. +
-We're leaving. -Oh, God. +
Let me tell you something, +
I was that woman ten years ago. +
But I wielded my power in a benevolent manner. +
Can we please talk about this over lunch somewhere else? +
What, somewhere like New Jersey, +
where we might actually get seated? +
Do you realize if she were a man, +
not only would we be eating right now, +
but they'd be sending over free drinks. +
Well, listen, I know a great Thai place around the corner +
where the owner's son practically always sends over +
a complimentary order of mee krob. +
How sad. Do you think we can get it to go? +
A short time later, Samantha headed back to her office, +
while I decided to investigate this theory I had about shopping +
as a way to unleash the creative subconscious. +
Alright, I'm gonna take them. +
I was already planning on returning them when... +
Miss? +
They told me to do that, +
and now they want to talk to you. +
Scusa. +
That won't be necessary. +
-Oh, my God! +
-I don't believe it! +
When did you get to town? +
Just yesterday. +
Darling, you look fantastic! +
Oh, I can't let you do this. +
Of course you can, and you can pay me back never. +
Besides, it's on Carlo. +
Oh, wow. +
When did you two... +
About two months. +
His family has this gigantic ranch in Argentina. +
Very, very wealthy. +
He has a tiny little penis, +
but he knows exactly how to use it. +
Wave, darling, wave. +
-Ciao, ciao, ciao. +
Well, that's very nice of you, but I just, I can't accept these. +
But of course you can. +
When have I ever given you a birthday present +
or a Christmas present? +
I mean, you're like a sister to me, +
yet I never see you! Oh! +
The truth was, we'd only met a few times. +
Most people would classify Amalita as Eurotrash, +
I thought she was fun. +
So, call me. +
I'm staying at the Four Seasons with Carlo. +
Don't you live in the city? +
I'm a citizen of the world. +
A citizen of the world, darling. +
Now take the shoes and we'll talk soon, eh? +
-I can't-- I can't do this. -Of course you can! +
-Thank you. -Go, go, amore . +
Ciao! +
I couldn't understand a word she was saying, +
but I felt I had in my possession +
all the Italian I'd ever need to know. +
Dolce, Dolce, Dolce. +
While at home, all the English I seemed to encounter +
was bills, bills, bills. +
I envied Amalita. +
Her life was a blur of rich men, +
designer clothes and glamorous resorts. +
She didn't actually work for a living, +
yet possessed a dazzling sexual power +
that she exploited to her full advantage, +
which presented a certain conundrum. +
Where's the line between professional girlfriend +
and just plain professional? +
Women have the right to use every means at their disposal +
to achieve power. +
Short of sleeping their way to the top. +
Not if that's what it takes to compete. +
But that's exploitation! +
Of men! +
Which is perfectly legal. +
Saturday night, in an effort to save money, +
and maybe even pick up a few extra bucks, +
I invited the girls over for poker. +
-I'll buy two. -I'm in for three. +
So you advocate a double standard. +
Women can use their sexuality to get ahead whenever possible, +
but men should not be allowed to take advantage of it? +
No, I'm just saying that men and women +
are equal opportunity exploiters. +
What if you sense that someone is giving you +
a professional advantage because they find you charming? +
"Charming"? +
This I got to hear. +
Well, a few days ago, Neville Morgan, +
the notoriously reclusive painter, +
paid a visit to the gallery. +
Neville was making his yearly pilgrimage to Manhattan +
to check out what was new and hot on the art scene. +
And he found it... +
Charlotte. +
It was only a matter of moments +
before he invited her to his farm upstate +
to view his latest work. +
So, if I could get him to show at the gallery, +
it would be an incredible coup, +
but what if he wants me to, you know... +
Hold his brush? +
If he so much as suggests what she's suggesting, +
you give me a call and we'll sue the hell out of him. +
That's the only proper way to trade sex for power. +
I can't believe what I'm hearing. +
You're like the Harvard Law Lorena Bobbit. +
Uh, it's Skipper, I told him I was here +
and he insisted on picking me up. +
But he's not supposed to be here 'til eleven. +
Aw, he's like a sweet little seal pup. +
That you sometimes want to club. +
You're an hour early. +
Oh, I can wait in the hall. +
No, Skipper, come in. +
It's alright. +
I'm leaving anyway. +
You guys have cleaned me out. +
Goodnight, ladies! +
Charlotte, keep me posted. +
A couple of hours later, +
I was looking forward to calling it an early night, when... +
Hello? +
Carrie, you bitch, what are you doing? +
Actually, I'm getting ready to go to sleep. +
Why don't you come and join us? +
We're at Balzac, +
and there is someone here I'm dying for you to meet. +
Oh, I'd love to, +
but I'm really trying to cut back. +
You know, pinch a few pennies. +
You are crazy, you know that? +
Why don't you just come down here +
and be your fabulous self? +
The truth was, I could barely afford that either. +
But I rationalized that my new shoes shouldn't be punished +
just because I can't budget. +
Hi. +
Sorry, uh, you're not on the list. +
Oh, no, no, I don't need a list. +
My friends are already in. +
Darling, what took you so Long? +
You won't believe what Carlo bought me this afternoon +
-at Van Cleef & Arpels. -Oh. What? +
-Oh my God, that's gorgeous. +
Twelve thousand dollars. +
-Oh, wow. -Mmm. +
Listen, I want you to come and meet +
the world's most fabulous man! +
Sounds like a trendy sideshow act. +
You're crazy! +
Carrie, I'd like you to meet my boyfriend, Carlo... +
Hi. +
...and his friend Gilles. +
Hello. +
Nice to meet you. +
Gilles is an architect from Paris. +
Oh, how long are you here for? +
Just a couple of days on business. +
I've told Gilles all about you. +
I told him you are the most beautiful, +
talented and fascinating woman in New York. +
And single. +
How is this possible? +
Oh, I get it. You're a... +
You're an architect and a comedian. +
I don't understand. +
Oh, nothing, nothing. +
I'm just, uh... I'm just being un peu stupide. +
You? +
Never. +
I suddenly recalled my terrible weakness +
for gorgeous French architects. +
Can I get anyone something else? +
Um... +
Would you like another bottle of wine? +
Wonderful. +
And what will the rest of you be having? +
During the next couple of hours, +
I put my journalistic skills to good use. +
I discovered that Gilles was recently divorced +
with a five-year-old daughter, Beatrice, +
who lived with her mother in Paris. +
He was passing through New York on his way to Brazil +
to supervise construction of a new hotel. +
I think you're too beautiful to be a writer. +
Hmm, I think you're too charming to be an architect. +
I think you should give up your life here +
and move with me to Paris immediately. +
I thought you were spending the next six months in Brazil. +
You can join me there first. +
Oh, don't tempt me. +
I'm so broke these days, +
I might take you up on that offer just to save in rent. +
Writing does not pay well? +
No, no, it does, it does. +
It's just, um... +
I have this little substance abuse problem. +
Expensive footwear. +
I see. +
I'm only here for the weekend, +
but I would love to see you tomorrow, +
maybe you could show me the town. +
Why? You've never been to New York? +
Oh, about twelve times. +
But I've never seen it with someone like you. +
You really have that certain je ne sais quoi, don't you? +
Yes. +
And so do you. +
So, um... +
I'll see you tomorrow. +
Goodnight. +
Bonsoir. +
Sure, +
divorced, French, and almost uncomfortably handsome. +
But I felt like I was floating on air. +
The next morning, I was brought back down to earth +
as I confronted +
a closet full of clothes, nothing to wear. +
Just a minute! +
Who is it? +
-Skipper. -Oh. +
-Hey! -Hey. +
I'm sorry, I should go. This... +
No, no, no, Skipper, Skipper, come on in. +
What is it? +
It's Miranda, she's got me totally w-- whacked. +
It's like I-- I'm obsessed. It's... +
And I, and I know that I shouldn't be, +
because I can sense that it's, it's totally turning her off, but... +
Here. +
I-- I can't control it, I can't. +
It's like she's got this power over me +
and-- and I'm helpless. +
Keep going, I just, I have to get dressed, all right? +
Is it possible to be addicted to a person? +
I mean, the sex is so awesome, +
that it's like, it's all I can think about. +
You know? I-- I've never considered myself a, a... +
you know, a-- a horn-dog before, +
but I'm worried I might be starting to scare her off. +
Well, is that what she said? +
No, but mostly we just have sex in the afternoon. +
She never lets me spend the night. +
Well, I have an idea. +
Why don't the two of you... +
just spend a night together, you know, +
and not have sex? +
That would be hard. +
That would be really hard. +
Well, I think it's really important that you try. +
I don't even shower afterwards. +
I-- I-- I like to spend the whole day +
smelling like Miranda. +
I began to fear that Miranda's sexuality +
was overpowering poor Skipper. +
Later, I spent the most incredibly romantic afternoon with Gilles. +
I felt like I had landed in a Claude Lelouch film... +
A man and a slightly neurotic woman. +
Wait, wait. +
I kind of have this rule. +
I don't sleep with men I've only known a day. +
I see. +
I gave in. +
After all, it was already tomorrow in Paris. +
You look so beautiful when you sleep. +
I didn't want to disturb you. +
Are you leaving so early? +
I've got a plane. +
I'll get up. +
No, no, stay in bed, order room service. +
Enjoy yourself, eh? +
Well, I-- I can just get dressed. +
Relax. +
I'll call you. +
Okay. +
Bon voyage! +
As he walked out the door, it suddenly dawned on me +
that he didn't have my phone number, +
and I didn't have his phone number. +
But he had left me a note... +
with a thousand dollars in cash! +
"Thanks for the beautiful day." +
Must have been a hell of a beautiful day. +
Well, it was. +
We had such a fantastic connection, +
then he leaves me money. +
I don't understand. +
What exactly about me screams "whore"? +
Besides the thousand dollars on the end table? +
I just can't believe that you had dinner at Balzac. +
Wait a minute, I thought I ordered two eggs Benedict +
and one spinach omelet. +
It's all right, I'll take the omelet. +
You know what, you guys? This isn't right. +
We're gonna pay for all this ourselves, alright? +
He said order anything. +
The room service is one thing, but the money, uh-uh. +
What are you getting so uptight about? +
I mean, money is power, sex is power, +
therefore, getting money for sex +
is simply an exchange of power. +
Don't listen to the dime store Camille Paglia. +
I don't know whether to take it as an incredible compliment +
or an incredible insult. +
Just take it, period. +
Well, I wouldn't know how to return it anyway, +
because the one thing he didn't leave me was his phone number. +
He paid in full, what more is there to talk about? +
Who is this Amalita Amalfi character, anyway? +
I'm concerned that you've been drafted +
into a ring of high class hookers. +
She isn't a hooker. +
She's... She's like an international party girl. +
She's a hooker with a passport. +
Did you ever have any conversations about money? +
No, I mean, I did allude to the fact +
that I was a bit cash poor these days. +
So maybe it's supposed to be a loan? +
I don't remember filling out an application. +
Sweetheart, men give, women receive. +
It's biological destiny. +
Hello! Do you really want to be saying that? +
I mean, that's exactly the kind of argument men have been using +
-since the dawn of time to exploit women! Wait a minute... +
You guys, you guys, you guys. I'm just gonna-- You know what? +
I'm gonna write the whole thing off as a bad date with a cash bonus. +
You know, that salmon is really good. +
I think we should order another one. +
As I struggled with the dilemma +
of how to manage my newfound money... +
Charlotte arrived at the secluded Connecticut home +
of the painter Neville Morgan, +
in an attempt to secure his latest work. +
Hi, welcome. +
Hi, I feel so privileged. +
Meeting you is, without a doubt, +
the high point of my career. +
Thank you. +
I'm frankly surprised that someone as young as you +
is even familiar with my work. +
Are you serious? I studied you in college! +
Oh, my God. +
-I apologize, I really do. +
Oh, you're much too modest. +
Ah, here we are. +
Excuse me. +
Now, the canvases you're about to see +
are what I consider to be the apotheosis +
of every great idea I've ever had. +
It's the closest I've ever come +
to pure universal God force. +
The cunt. +
Uh... Oh my. +
They're very powerful. +
Exactly! +
The most powerful force +
in the universe. +
The source of all life +
and pleasure, +
and beauty. +
That's true. +
I used to paint full nudes, +
but as I got older, I realized +
that the truth +
was to be found only in the cunt. +
Charlotte hated the "C" word, +
but Neville Morgan was not a man to be corrected. +
Hi. +
I thought you might like something to drink. +
Charlotte, +
this is my wife, Gertrude. +
It's a pleasure. +
Lemonade and cookies? +
Thank you. +
Each of these portraits... +
is of a woman... +
who has touched my life. +
Incredible. +
I wonder... +
would you consider posing for me some time? +
Me? I-- I-- I... +
Uh, well... +
Um, I'm very flattered. +
Excellent. +
So long as you're here, +
I could sketch you this afternoon. +
I bet you have a beautiful cunt, dear. +
As Charlotte pondered how far she would go +
for her love of art and the gallery... +
Another Saturday night, +
with my hooker money still burning a hole in my pocket, +
Samantha and I showed up at Balzac. +
She reasoned that since I was there once, +
I was as good as in. +
I don't understand. +
I made this reservation weeks ago, +
and she's already been here. +
I'm sorry. +
Is there a host that I might talk to? +
I will snap her. +
I will put her over my knee +
and I will snap her like a twig. +
I'm sorry. +
I'm hungry. +
I'm going to go to the bathroom, +
and then we're leaving, right? +
Ah! Carrie, Carrie, Ciao! Ciao! +
Come here! +
They all looked so chic and glamorous, +
part of me wanted to grab Samantha and make a run for it, +
while another part... +
Hi, how are ya? +
Carrie, I want you to meet Mario, Alan, +
Justine and Peter. +
Hi. +
Mario's family has one of those gorgeous palazzo's +
on the Grand Canal in Venezia +
and we're all going there next week for the film festival. +
You should join us. +
Absolutely, yes. +
You must bring your little laptop and write all about it. +
You'd be mad not to go! +
Mario, Carrie is one of the most fascinating, +
talented and beautiful women in New York. +
I have no doubt. +
I've never been to Venice. +
No! +
Venice is the most beautiful, +
the most romantic city in the world. +
Really? +
I, uh, I-- I-- I heard it was sinking. +
That's why you must come immediately. +
Before it's all gone. +
I couldn't say I wasn't tempted. +
I realized that I could leverage myself +
like the human equivalent of a sexy junk bond. +
I'd parlay that thousand dollars into a trip to Venice, +
into a nice piece of jewelry, +
a rich husband, followed by a richer divorce. +
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to say goodbye. +
I'm here with a friend. +
She's waiting for me at the bar. +
What a pity. +
Call me, +
I'm staying at The Carlyle with Peter. +
Okay, ciao. +
Ciao. +
Just because Venice was sinking +
didn't mean my morals had to go down with it. +
And as for Gilles and the thousand dollars, +
I figured there was nothing to be done. +
For better or worse, +
I had just established my rate for a one night stand. +
Excuse me. +
And then the most powerful woman in Manhattan +
asked me for a favor. +
Do you have a tampon? +
Oh, sure! +
Of course. +
Thanks a lot. +
I never told Samantha the source of my newfound power. +
But from that moment on, +
we never had a problem getting a table at Balzac again. +
A couple of weeks later, +
we were all there to celebrate Charlotte's coup. +
Hi. +
Excuse me just a second. +
Are you number nine? +
Oh, my God, +
I am so not number nine. +
Five. +
Yeah, right. +
It's this, right? +
-No? +
Well? +
Really? +
They say a picture is worth a thousand words. +
But in this case... +
I was speechless. +
\N“女性的权力” +
\N纽约最有权势的女人 不是蒂娜布朗 +
\N或黛安索耶 也不是萝西欧唐纳 +
\N而是巴尔札克餐厅 负责带位的接待员 +
\N那儿已成为唯一有分量的餐厅 +
\N我们也赶上了这股热潮 +
\N这真是太侮辱人了 我们已经等了45分钟了 +
\N-我快要昏倒了 -难道她不知道我们是谁？ +
\N我们是谁？ +

\N你觉得需要50块吗？ +
\N如果我有50块 你认为我会给她吗？ +
\N她不能这么对我们﹐我们走 +
\N我告诉你﹐十年前我跟她一样 +
\N但我不会这样趾高气扬 +
\N可以等我们找到地方 吃午餐时再谈吗？ +
\N譬如说像新泽西那种 一定有位子的地方吗？ +
\N你搞清楚﹐如果她是个男人 +
\N我们现在不止有东西吃 他们还会自动送上免费饮料 +
\N听着﹐我知道转角有一家 很棒的泰国菜 +
\N老板的儿子每次都会 附赠泰式炒面 +
\N真可悲 你想我们可以外带吗？ +
\N不久﹐莎曼珊回她的办公室 +
\N而我决定去验证一个关于购物 +

\N好﹐我就要这双 +
\N当我心中正盘算将鞋子退还… +
\N小姐？ +
\N他们叫我这么做 麻烦你听一下电话 +
\N-借过﹐没这个必要 -天啊﹐我真不敢相信 +
\N-你什么时候到的？ -昨天才到 +
\N-亲爱的﹐你美极了 -我不能接受你的好意 +
\N你当然可以﹐别客气 再说﹐是卡罗付的钱 +
\N-你们两个什么时候… -大约两个月了 +
\N他的家族在阿根廷 拥有一座大农场﹐非常有钱 +
\N虽然他那话儿小得不得了 但他掌握了绝妙的使用方法 +
\N挥挥手﹐亲爱的 +
\N你真好﹐但我不能接受 +
\N当然可以 +
\N我几时送过你生日或圣诞礼物 +
\N你就像是我的姐妹 虽然我们并不常见面 +
\N事实上我们只见过几次面 +
\N大多数人将艾玛莉塔归类为 欧洲享乐派﹐我觉得她很风趣 +

\N-你在这里没有置产吗？ -我四海为家 +
\N亲爱的﹐我四海为家 鞋子拿着﹐我们再找时间聊聊 +

\N回到家里﹐映入眼帘的英文字 全是“帐单” +
\N我羡慕艾玛莉塔 +
\N她的生活由有钱人﹑名牌服饰 以及迷人的度假胜地交织而成 +
\N她不需要工作赚钱 却靠着自身魅力 +
\N发挥得淋漓尽致 +
\N这便浮现了一个问题 +
\N究竟称职的女友 和以当女伴为专职 +
\N两者之间的界线是什么？ +
\N女人有权不择手段获得权力 +
\N-除了上床之外 -如果必要又有何不可 +
\N-那是一种剥削 -对男人﹐这完全合法 +
\N周末夜﹐为了节省开支 +
\N也许还可以赚点小钱 +
\N我邀请她们到家里打牌 +
\N-我出二张 -我三张 +
\N你根本是双重标准 +
\N女人可以随时用性往上爬 +
\N男人却不该被允许这么做？ +
\N我只是说男人和女人 均享有同等的机会 +
\N如果你发现 有人因觉得你很迷人 +
\N而让你在工作上占到便宜呢？ +
\N-迷人？ -这我倒要听听了 +
\N几天前﹐声名狼藉的隐居画家 纳维耶摩根 +
\N来画廊参观 +
\N纳维耶正在曼哈顿 进行他的年度观摩 +
\N看看艺术界有何新的热门作品 +
\N而他发现了…夏绿蒂 +
\N他邀请她去郊区的农场 参观其最新力作 +
\N不过是时间早晚的问题 +

\N这将是个了不起的成就 但若他要我… +
\N-你知道的 -帮他口交？ +
\N若他真如她所暗示 对你提出这种要求 +
\N你给我一通电话 我们绝对告到他身败名裂 +
\N那是唯一用性来交换权力的 合理方法 +
\N真不敢相信我所听到的 +
\N你的语气就像是萝瑞娜巴比特 +
\N是史奇普﹐我跟他说我在这里 他坚持要来接我 +
\N但他应该11点才到 +
\N-他真像个体贴的小男人 -但有时候欠揍 +
\N-你早到一小时 -我可以在大厅等 +
\N-史奇普﹐进来吧 -没关系﹐反正我也要走了 +
\N你们这些家伙把我给榨干了 再见 +
\N夏绿蒂﹐随时让我知道情况 +
\N几个小时后 我正打算早点睡﹐却… +

\N我跟他说你是全纽约 +
\N最漂亮﹑最有才华的美女 +
\N而且还是单身贵族 这怎么可能？ +
\N我知道了 你是建筑师兼喜剧演员 +
\N-我不明白 -我只是说傻话 +
\N你？绝不可能 +
\N我突然意识到自己对于迷人的 法国建筑师毫无招架之力 +
\N还需要什么吗？ +
\N-要不要再开一瓶酒？ -好极了 +
\N那其他人还想来点什么？ +
\N接下来的几个小时 我拿出新闻工作者的看家本领 +
\N我打听到吉尔最近刚离婚 +
\N他的女儿和前妻住在巴黎 +
\N纽约之行后他还要前往巴西 +
\N为一家新旅馆监工 +
\N你太漂亮了﹐不可能是个作家 +

\N你不是要在巴西停留六个月？ +
\N-你可以先陪我一起去 -别诱惑我 +
\N我现在手头很紧 很可能会为了省租金而答应你 +
\N-写作酬劳不好吗？ -不﹐很不错﹐只是… +

\N是你 +
\N-对不起﹐我还是走好了 -不﹐史奇普﹐快进来 +
\N什么事？ +
\N米兰达把我弄得筋疲力尽 我好像迷恋上她了 +
\N我知道这样让她胃口尽失 +
\N但是我控制不了自己 +
\N仿佛我被她吃定了似的 我却无计可施 +
\N继续说﹐我得换衣服﹐好吗？ +
\N有可能对一个人着迷吗？ +
\N我们的性生活棒呆了 我满脑子都是那档事 +
\N以前我从不认为自己… +
\N你知道﹐这么性致勃勃 +
\N我担心这样下去会把她吓跑 +
\N她这么说吗？ +
\N我们只在下午做爱 她从不让我过夜 +
\N我有个主意 +
\N你们两个何不试试 一起过夜却不做爱？ +
\N那太困难了 +
\N我觉得去尝试一下很重要 +
\N我办完事后甚至不洗澡 +
\N我喜欢一整天身上都有 米兰达的味道 +
\N我开始担心米兰达的魅力 +
\N对可怜的史奇普而言 太过强势了 +
\N稍后﹐我和吉尔共度了一个 最浪漫的午后时光 +
\N我感觉仿佛坠入 克劳德雷路许的电影中 +
\N一个男人 和一个有点神经质的女人 +
\N慢着…我有个规矩 +
\N我不跟只认识一天的男人上床 +
\N我懂了 +
\N我投降了 毕竟在巴黎﹐这已经是明天了 +
\N你睡梦中的样子好美 我不想吵醒你 +
\N-你这么早就要走了吗？ -我得赶飞机 +
\N-我起来 -不﹐你躺着 +
\N叫客房服务﹐好好享受 +
\N-我可以起来穿衣服 -放轻松… +
\N-我再打电话给你 -好 +
\N一路顺风 +
\N他离去之后我才发现 +
\N他根本没有我的电话 而我也没有他的电话 +
\N但他留了张纸条给我… +
\N还附上一千元现金 +
\N“谢谢你给我美好的一天” 肯定美好到极点了 +
\N的确是 +
\N我们相处非常愉快﹐性情相投 但他却留钱给我 +
\N我不明白﹐他当我是妓女吗？ +
\N-除了桌上的一千块？ -你竟然在巴尔札克用餐 +
\N我点的是两份松饼夹蛋 和一份菠菜蛋卷 +
\N-蛋卷给我 -这些我们要自己付钱对吧？ +
\N他说尽管点 +
\N客房服务是一回事 但钱…万万不可 +
\N你紧张什么？ +
\N金钱就是权力﹐性就是权力 +
\N用钱换性只是一种权力的交换 +
\N别听卡蜜尔佩格莉亚胡说八道 +
\N我该把这当作无上的恭维 还是莫大的侮辱？ +
\N收下就对了 +
\N我无法将钱退还给他 因为他没留下电话号码 +
\N他已经全部付清了 还有什么话好说？ +
\N艾玛莉塔阿玛菲到底是谁？ +
\N我担心你陷入 一伙高级妓女的圈套了 +
\N她不是妓女 她像是个国际玩伴女郎 +
\N那她是个持有护照的妓女 你们曾经谈过钱的事吗？ +
\N没有﹐不过我倒是提过 最近我手头比较紧 +
\N那么也许这是一笔借款？ +
\N我不记得曾提出申请 +
\N男人给﹐女人收 这是与生俱来的定律 +
\N你真的这么认为吗？ +
\N那是自从盘古开天以来 +
\N男人一直用来剥削女人的藉口 +
\N就让这件事到此为止﹐当作是 一次有现金红利的失败约会 +
\N这鲑鱼美味极了 我觉得应该再多点一份 +
\N正当我烦恼该如何处理 那笔新发现的钱时 +
\N夏绿蒂抵达画家纳维耶摩根 位于康乃迪克州的僻静住宅 +
\N为的是获得他最新力作 独家展览的机会 +
\N你好﹐欢迎 +
\N我觉得好幸运 和你会面是我事业中的高峰 +
\N谢谢你﹐很惊讶像你这么年轻 竟然熟悉我的作品 +
\N别开玩笑了 我大学时便研究你的画风 +
\N-我的天﹐真的很抱歉 -你太客气了 +
\N就是这里﹐不好意思 +
\N你将看到的油画是我心目中 +
\N所有绝妙灵感的完美呈现 +
\N此刻是我最接近 纯粹的全能上帝的力量 +
\N女性的阴部 +
\N我的天 +
\N-它们非常惊心动魄 -没错 +
\N宇宙间最强大的力量 +
\N所有生命﹑欢愉和美的源头 +
\N是的 +
\N以前我画裸体画像 但随着年龄增长 +
\N我发现只有在阴部 才能寻到真理 +
\N夏绿蒂不喜欢听到那个字 +
\N但纳维耶摩根是不容纠正的 +
\N你好﹐我想你可能想喝点东西 +
\N-夏绿蒂﹐这是我太太姬楚 -幸会 +
\N-来点柠檬水和饼干？ -谢谢你 +
\N每一幅画都是曾经 走入我生命的女人 +
\N真是大开眼界 +
\N我在想﹐不知你是否愿意 当我的模特儿？ +
\N我？这… +
\N这… +
\N我受宠若惊 +
\N太好了﹐既然你来了 今天下午我可以先画草图 +
\N亲爱的 我敢说你的阴部一定很美 +
\N当夏绿蒂思量她对艺术的热爱 究竟能让她牺牲到什么地步… +
\N另一个周末夜 +
\N口袋里带着那笔 蠢蠢欲动的“夜度资” +
\N我和莎曼珊 出现在巴尔札克餐厅 +
\N她认为既然我曾进去过一次 从此便能通行无阻 +
\N我真不明白 我几个星期前就订位了 +
\N而且她还曾经在这里用餐 +
\N-很抱歉 -找你们主管﹐我跟他说 +
\N我要把她劈成两半 让她跪在我膝下 +
\N像折树枝般将她折成两半 +
\N对不起﹐我好饿 +
\N等我去完洗手间 我们就离开这里好吗？ +
\N凯莉 +
\N过来这里 +
\N他们看起来全都既潇洒又迷人 +
\N一部分的我 想拉着莎曼珊转身就走 +
\N然而另一部分的我… +
\N你好吗？ +
\N我希望你见见 马利欧﹑亚伦﹑贾斯汀和彼得 +
\N你们好 +
\N马利欧的家族在威尼斯的 大运河边有幢豪宅 +
\N下星期我们都要去那里 参加电影节 +
\N-你应该跟我们一起去 -一点也没错 +
\N带着你的手提电脑 把你的所见所闻写下来 +
\N你若不去一定是疯了 +
\N凯莉是全纽约最漂亮 +
\N最有才华的美女之一 +
\N-这点无庸置疑 -我从没去过威尼斯 +
\N不会吧 +
\N威尼斯是世界上 最美丽﹑浪漫的城市 +
\N真的吗？我听说它正在下沉 +
\N那你就更应该去了 在它完全消失以前 +
\N我不能说我有没动心 +
\N我发现我可以利用 杠杆原理举债经营 +
\N就像投资一项性感的垃圾债券 +
\N我可以把那一千块拿来下注在 威尼斯之旅 +
\N精美的珠宝﹑有钱的丈夫 和离婚后的优越生活 +
\N抱歉﹐我得道别了 我跟朋友一起来﹐她正在等我 +
\N真可惜 +
\N打电话给我 我和彼得住在卡莱尔饭店 +
\N-好的﹐再见 -再见 +
\N威尼斯正在下沉 +
\N不代表我的人格也要跟着沦陷 +
\N至于吉尔和那一千块钱 我想没什么好在意的 +
\N不管怎样 +
\N我已经为一夜情定好了价码 +
\N不好意思 +
\N曼哈顿最有权势的女人 请我帮她一个忙 +
\N请问你有没有卫生棉？ +
\N当然有 +
\N谢谢 +
\N我没告诉莎曼珊 我新权力的来源为何 +
\N不过从那时起 +
\N我们再也不曾被挡在 巴尔札克餐厅门外了 +
\N几个星期后﹐我们聚在一起 庆祝夏绿蒂的成功 +
\N你好﹐不好意思﹐我们先走 +
\N-你是第九号吗？ -我的天啊 +
\N-我才不是第九号 -第五 +
\N才怪 +
\N是这个吧？不是？ +
\N那么是… +
\N真的？ +
\N有人说一幅画千言万语说不尽 +
\N但面对这一幅… +
\N我哑口无言 +
