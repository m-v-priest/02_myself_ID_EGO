Once upon a "second time around..." + 
...in a mythical land + 
between Carmine and Mulberry streets, + 
two mere mortals were having a wonderful time. + 
-Hey, Paisan! -Carlo! + 
Come stai? + 
Carrie, this is the gangster I was telling you about. + 
Gangster? No, no, no, no, no gangster. + 
Really, come this way. + 
Ah, grazie. + 
-Carrie, this is Paolo. Hello. + 
Paolo, this is my girlfriend, Carrie. + 
Bread? + 
You've never called me your girlfriend before. + 
Sure, I have. + 
Just not to your face. + 
Bravo! + 
Hey, grazie, grazie! + 
And now you, + 
you wise guy, come on, it's your turn. + 
-Come on. -Me? + 
Come on. -Okay. + 
-No, no, no, not-- not funny, Mr. Sambuca. -No, relax. + 
I'm a regular. + 
-I'm a regular. I'm a regular. -A regular? + 
I'd like to dedicate this song to the lovely lady + 
sitting right over there. + 
? When I was 17 ? + 
? It was a very good year ? + 
? It was a very good year ? + 
? For small town girls and soft summer nights ? + 
? We'd hide from the lights ? + 
? In the village green ? + 
? When I was 17 ? + 
It was perfect, I felt like I was in heaven. + 
Meanwhile, across town, Miranda was in hell. + 
...douche products... + 
Or its modern day equivalent, + 
the comedy club. + 
Are we having fun yet? + 
Yeah, when does the comedy start? + 
I've never been this close to suicide. + 
...not pussy... + 
I'll get the check. + 
If you ditch me in this place, + 
I will hunt you down, and kill you. + 
All right? You wanna walk up... + 
Alan Miller was a divorced architect + 
Miranda met in aisle number three + 
at the Food Emporium. + 
They immediately bonded over a shared hatred + 
of designer croutons. + 
And I don't know about all you other guys, + 
but if all I was interested in was freshness, + 
then I would be fucking my salad crisper! + 
Yo, Red! + 
You wanna answer your fuckin' phone? + 
It's, uh... It's not my phone. + 
Go ahead, answer it. + 
Answer it! + 
Alan Miller's phone. + 
No, this is his date, who's this? + 
Who is it? + 
I'm sorry, his date can't speak right now, + 
whom may I say is calling? + 
His wife! + 
Hey, lug nuts, your wife's on the phone. + 
You told me you were divorced. + 
I'm not really divorced. + 
I'm really separated. + 
No, we're really separated. + 
See, this is me, separating. + 
Yo, Red, not so fast. + 
I'll fuck you. + 
Honey... + 
If they're not married, they're gay, + 
or burned from a divorce, or aliens from the planet + 
"Don't Date Me"! + 
It's amazing how many of them walk among us now. + 
Only recognizable by their slightly larger heads. + 
I asked him, point blank, + 
how long have you been divorced? + 
Three years, just like that, three years. + 
Guys are such liars. + 
And 97% of them can't fuck you worth a damn! + 
He tells me how much he likes me, and boom, + 
I believe him. + 
Am I that needy? + 
Well, maybe he really did like you. + 
I swear, if you Pollyanna-out on me today, + 
I'm gonna have to hit you with this rice pudding. + 
This married man fell madly in love + 
with my friend Amanda's friend Ashley, + 
and he said he would get a divorce and he did. + 
And they got married and they moved to Connecticut, + 
and he is this amazing husband and father. + 
Never happened. + 
-Excuse me? -Urban relationship myth. + 
Unbelievable fairy tales concocted by women + 
to make their love lives seem less hopeless. + 
Exactly, except it makes you feel even more hopeless + 
because this fabulous magical relationship + 
is never happening to you. + 
It did happen! + 
It's right up there with the one about + 
the guy who couldn't commit + 
and the woman broke up with him + 
and moved away to Kansas or some place, + 
and then one night, she comes walking home... + 
In the rain! + 
Always, in the rain. + 
And he's standing there in front of her door + 
with an engagement ring + 
and he says, "Marry me" + 
and they live happily ever after. + 
But it can happen. + 
People do live happily ever after. + 
It happened to my friend Amanda's friend. + 
It's always a friend who knows a friend who knows a friend. + 
Charlotte, honey, + 
have you actually ever known anyone + 
who's relationship changed magically overnight? + 
Yes. + 
Look at Carrie and Big. + 
Their relationship is totally different + 
than it used to be. + 
How, tell me, how is it different? + 
It just is, I can't explain it, it's... + 
Actually I can, but you're so scary right now, I won't. + 
No, really, tell me. + 
It's just a feeling. + 
I don't know, something shifted, it's like, um... + 
maybe we both know that if we came together again, + 
it must be for a reason. + 
What, why is that so hard to believe? + 
How much time have you got? + 
That afternoon, + 
I got to thinking about myths and relationships. + 
Heroes, boyfriends, cyclopses, divorced guys. + 
Are they really that different? + 
The primitive Greeks clung desperately to myths + 
to explain the random hopelessness + 
of their miserable lives. + 
Do modern day singles need modern day myths + 
just to help us get through + 
our random and sometimes miserable relationships? + 
And what about Big and me? + 
After what seemed like an eternity + 
of not quite fitting together, + 
we suddenly fit. + 
Had the relationship, God smiled, + 
or was that something I desperately needed to believe? + 
Are we willing to believe anything to date? + 
While Samantha had little belief in the idea + 
of happily ever after, + 
she had a very strong belief in the idea + 
of a smart cocktail at the end of the work day. + 
Samantha, a Cosmopolitan, and Donald Trump. + 
You just don't get more New York than that. + 
Listen, Ed, I've gotta go. + 
Yeah, good, Donald. + 
-But think about it. -Yeah. + 
I'll be at my office at Trump Tower. + 
Good. + 
Excuse me. + 
I was so distracted by your beauty, + 
I think I just agreed to finance Mr. Trump's + 
new project. + 
You owe me me 150 million dollars. + 
Will you take a check? + 
May I buy you a drink? + 
I already have one, thanks. + 
Can I buy you an island? + 
I don't know, can you? + 
The name's Ed. + 
Samantha. + 
So, Samantha, do you come here often? + 
Honey, that line's older than you are. + 
You are a pistol. + 
Ed, you have no idea. + 
A bottle of their best champagne later, + 
Samantha had learned that Ed was single, + 
available, and a millionaire many, many times over. + 
What's your age ceiling with men? + 
Fifty? + 
Factor in millions and millions of dollars. + 
Fifty? + 
Well, I just met the cutest older man. + 
How old, fifty? + 
Sixty? + 
Sweetie, is he on Medicare? + 
I'm guessing 72, a young 72. + 
Your silence reeks of ageism. + 
Are you serious? + 
He took me to dinner at Jean-Georges, + 
we got right in, no reservation needed. + 
I wasn't aware that Jean-Georges + 
had an early-bird special! + 
He's vibrant and powerful and generous. + 
And he's just looking for someone to have a little fun with. + 
And would that include bedroom fun? + 
We haven't discussed it yet. + 
Are you telling me that you are seriously capable + 
of having sex with a senior? + 
Well, you know the saying. + 
All cats look the same in the dark. + 
It was pure urban legend. + 
Alligators in the sewer, + 
pets in the microwave + 
and now an old man in Samantha. + 
Is this a piece of veal or is this a piece of veal? + 
That is a piece of veal. + 
In every myth, there comes a point + 
when the mere mortals are given a test. + 
The way they respond + 
usually determines whether they find paradise + 
or are tied to a big rock for all eternity. + 
I have a huge request. + 
I want you to know my friends better. + 
I know your friends fine. + 
Charlotte is the brunette. + 
Miranda's the redhead. + 
And Samantha is trouble. + 
Okay, then I want them to know you better. + 
They've never really spent time with you, and... + 
you're so funny and cute. + 
Carrie, what is it you need? + 
I want us all to have dinner Saturday night at Denial. + 
Denial was a very popular Manhattan hot spot. + 
Apparently, everyone in Manhattan + 
wanted to be in denial. + 
Okay. + 
Why are you suddenly so... + 
Cute? + 
Yes. + 
Why are you so cute? + 
Hello. + 
Hey, where are you? + 
I've been waiting here forever. + 
Didn't you get my message? + 
I left it on your machine like an hour ago. + 
No, I didn't call home, is everything alright? + 
I thought you were dead or something. + 
No, no, I'm fine, I'm at Big's. + 
You're at Big's? + 
You and I are having dinner tonight. + 
Well, he got this veal. + 
You blew me off + 
for a piece of politically incorrect meat? + 
Well, he wanted to make me dinner. + 
So, you just dropped your life + 
and ran right on over to his! + 
Um, I really can't get into that right now. + 
You know what? + 
Your relationship is exactly the same as always. + 
It's all about him. + 
Could you put Miranda on, please? + 
Enjoy your veal. + 
Problem? + 
No, no. + 
I'll have another glass of wine. + 
Please. + 
Please what? + 
"I'll have another glass of wine, please." + 
Um, are you allowed to talk to me like that? + 
Yeah, I think I am. + 
Enjoy. + 
Thank you. + 
Steve. "Thank you, Steve." + 
Look, that's really very cute, + 
but I'm not really in the mood. + 
"I'm not really in the mood, Steve." + 
I'm not a total bitch, + 
I just had a fight with somebody. + 
Yeah, I heard, boyfriend? + 
That's none of your business. + 
Girlfriend? + 
-Butcher. -Butcher? + 
The veal... I took a shot. + 
What are you reading? + 
"The Joy of Bartending," Hemingway. + 
So, what, you're funny? + 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down... That's a nice C?tes du Rh?ne. + 
Enjoy. + 
Nah, it's on me. + 
And why would that be? + 
A bribe, so you'll hang out and talk. + 
If you leave, + 
I'll have to listen to those NYU kids + 
with the Amstel Lights discuss Fiona Apple. + 
I'm begging you. + 
But they did a little more than talk. + 
After work they went back to her place, + 
where Steve, the bartender, + 
served Miranda two orgasms, + 
straight up. + 
So, uh... that was, uh... really special. + 
Sure... + 
Is that your shirt over there? + 
Yeah. + 
So, can I get your phone number? + 
Why? + 
To call you up and ask you for a date. + 
Look... + 
Steve... "Look, Steve." + 
You don't have to do this. + 
You don't have to make believe you're gonna call. + 
Let's just call this what this was. + 
A one night stand. + 
You're a real pisser. + 
Stop by the bar, see me sometime. + 
Sure, okay, whatever. + 
Thanks, bye. + 
Great sex. + 
Three dinners and two extravagant lunches later, + 
Ed invited Samantha over to his townhouse. + 
Up until now, + 
Samantha would never have believed + 
she would consider a relationship with an older man. + 
But, there was something about Ed. + 
Oh! + 
Well, how did that get there? + 
I wonder if... + 
Oh, oh! + 
Oh, Ed, no. + 
Uh-huh. + 
After an impressive six course dinner, + 
Ed put the moves on Samantha. + 
Ed's moves were from a different dating time. + 
Moves Samantha had heard of or seen in old movies, + 
but moves she never thought she'd experience firsthand. + 
I used to groove with these cats in Cuba. + 
What's the matter, Ed? + 
-Can't afford the light bill? + 
You're fun... A toast to fun. + 
Mmm. + 
Oh, what the hell. + 
I'm gonna lay my cards on the table. + 
Samantha, + 
I figure I've only got a handful of good years left. + 
-Oh, no, Ed... -No, ten to twelve, tops. + 
And I'm looking for someone to have some fun with. + 
Now, I'm aware that a gorgeous woman like you + 
can get any young man you want. + 
-Well... -So, I'm willing to make it worth your while. + 
And speaking of wild, don't worry. + 
I got a big old pocket full of Viagra. + 
Why, Ed, that's not Viagra. + 
Samantha was suddenly living + 
her own urban relationship myth. + 
The woman who stopped for a cocktail after work + 
and lived happily ever after. + 
For ten to twelve years, tops. + 
I think in the dark is sexier. + 
Could you get that light behind you? + 
-Oh. + 
In the dark, Samantha learned + 
that all cats not only look the same, + 
but they felt the same. + 
Ed's lips were not the lips of an older man. + 
Ed's touch was not the touch of an older man. + 
Excuse me, baby, little boy's room. + 
Unfortunately, Ed's ass + 
was the ass of an older man. + 
She told him it was a bad reaction + 
to the shellfish from dinner. + 
Saturday afternoon, Miranda was at home + 
enjoying a cup of coffee and her New York Times + 
when fate came knocking. + 
Yes? + 
It's Steve. + 
Steve who? + 
Steve Brady, the bartender. + 
What do you want? + 
You want your neighbors to hear? + 
Hey, hi. + 
Thanks for letting me in. + 
Did you forget something the other night? + 
No, I didn't have your number + 
and I wanted to tell you something. + 
I like you. + 
Translation, I think you're an easy lay + 
and I'd like to have sex again. + 
No, it's not like that. + 
Have dinner with me. + 
Why? + 
I don't know, because we're hungry. + 
I can't have dinner with you, I don't even know you. + 
You slept with me. + 
It's a different thing. + 
How about tonight? + 
No, I have plans. + 
You don't have plans. + 
-I have plans. -What plans? + 
Quick, before you make one up. + 
I'm meeting my friends downtown at Denial for dinner. + 
Yeah? My buddy works over there. + 
I'll meet you for a drink, what time? + 
Seven. + 
Okay. + 
What time are you really meeting them? + 
Nine. + 
Mm! + 
At 8:15, I arrived at Big's. + 
One quick drink at his place, + 
and we'd be out the door. + 
I told myself all day + 
it was just another dinner with friends. + 
But, as I stood waiting, + 
in my new, very favorite dress, + 
I realized it meant a lot more. + 
Hey, baby, c'mon in. + 
Well, you are not properly attired + 
to meet my friends, mister, now hop to it. + 
Yeah, about that... uh... + 
Do you mind if I don't go? + 
I mean, I've been out all day, + 
it's gonna rain. + 
But my friends are expecting you. + 
Yeah, I know, but they're your friends, and... + 
they'll be fine with just you. + 
Is it okay? + 
Sure. + 
I was afraid if I looked up into his eyes, + 
I'd turn to stone. + 
How could I have let myself believe + 
things would be different the second time around? + 
I've never even heard of an urban relationship myth + 
in which a self-centered, 42-year-old baby + 
magically transformed into a grown man + 
that you could bring out in public. + 
They won't seat us until all of our party is here. + 
Oh. -How long do you think Big will be? + 
I'm not sure, he's coming from work. + 
I didn't have the strength to tell them about my fallen hero. + 
At least not without a cocktail. + 
I figured as long as I was in denial, + 
I might as well stay there. + 
Mmm! Look at you. + 
Well, if you want good service, send a bartender. + 
And if you want a good fuck, + 
go home with one. + 
Hello, it was funny! + 
Miranda, can I talk to you over there? + 
For a second. + 
The Gods are punishing me for having casual sex. + 
Oof. + 
Thank you. + 
One quick question and I'm out of here. + 
Why do you hate guys so much? + 
Excuse me? + 
We just met, + 
so I know that ain't all about me. + 
Wait, wait, wait! + 
What, what do you want? + 
I just wanna get to know you better. + 
Do me a favor, + 
can you, for one second, + 
believe that maybe I'm not some full of shit guy? + 
That maybe I do like you? + 
That maybe the other night was special? + 
Do you think that maybe you can believe that? + 
No. + 
Maybe I've just slept with too many bartenders. + 
Are you okay? + 
I don't wanna talk about it. + 
Nice meeting you all, excuse me. + 
Guys, maybe we should just get a table for us four. + 
I knew it, Big's not coming. + 
Men are shit. + 
Miranda, what are you talking about? + 
He's coming, isn't he? + 
I didn't know if I had the heart + 
to tell me Charlotte that happily ever after + 
really was just a myth. + 
See, there he is! + 
-Hey... whoa! -Hey. + 
Boy, it's really coming down out there. + 
You remember my friends? + 
Of course, I do. + 
-Hello, ladies. -Hello. + 
Seeing Big show up for me like that + 
shook Miranda's lack of belief system + 
to the very core. + 
Excuse me. + 
More drinks? + 
And just like that, Miranda left denial. + 
Steve! + 
Maybe I can believe it. + 
From that night on, + 
promiscuous women everywhere would tell the tale + 
of the one night stand + 
that turned into a relationship. + 
And as for Big and me... + 
So, Samantha, tell me... + 
Did you ever get it on with that old coot? + 
That was the night we stopped being a myth + 
and started becoming real. + 
欲望城市 + 
（性爱专家凯莉布雷萧） + 
，男人、神话、威而钢 + 
从前… + 
位于卡麦街和桑树街间 一处神秘之地… + 
有两个人玩得正开心 + 
保罗，你好吗？ + 
这位就是我跟你提过的恶棍 + 
恶棍？我才不是，往这边走 + 
谢谢 + 
凯莉，他是保罗 + 
保罗，她是我女朋友凯莉 + 
要不要吃面包？ + 
你从来没称呼我是你女朋友 + 
当然有，只是没在你面前说 + 
唱得好 + 
-唱得好 -谢谢… + 
现在，自命不凡的家伙 轮到你了，上来吧 + 
-我？好 -别去… + 
放心，这是家常便饭 + 
我想把这首歌 献给坐在那边的迷人小姐 + 
这一切十分完美 我感觉仿佛置身天堂 + 
在此同时，米兰达却深陷地狱 + 
冲洗产品 + 
用现代话说就是：搞笑俱乐部 + 
-你笑得出来吗？ -到底何时才开始搞笑？ + 
我从未这么想自杀 + 
-我去结帐 -你若丢下我跑掉我会杀了你 + 
亚伦米勒是米兰达在餐馆 认识的离婚建筑师 + 
他们立刻发现 彼此都对烤面包丁深恶痛绝 + 
如果我只对新鲜感兴趣 + 
我就会和我的沙拉脆片做爱 + 
红头发的 + 
你要不要接该死的电话？ + 
那…不是我的电话 + 
没关系，你接 + 
接电话… + 
这是亚伦米勒的电话 + 
-不，我是他女友，你是谁？ -谁打来的？ + 
抱歉，他女友现在不能说话 请问你哪位？ + 
他老婆 + 
笨蛋，你老婆打电话来 + 
你说你已经离婚了 + 
我还没有真正离婚 我们只是分居 + 
不，我们才要分手 看到没？这就是我，我要走了 + 
红头发的，别走这么快 我跟你上床 + 
亲爱的？ + 
如果他们未婚 一定是同性恋或离过婚 + 
要不就是外太空来的异形 别跟我约会 + 
他们数量惊人 在我们身边游走 + 
只能靠他们较大的头来辨认 + 
我问他“你离婚多久了？” + 
“三年”，一点也不心虚 男人都是骗子 + 
而百分之97不能跟你做爱的 男人更是毫无价值 + 
他告诉我他多喜欢我，我竟然 相信他，我有这么饥渴吗？ + 
也许他真的喜欢你 + 
你今天再跟我说这种话 我就拿这个米布丁砸你 + 
有个已婚男子 + 
疯狂爱上 我朋友阿曼达的朋友艾许莉 + 
他说他会离婚 结果他真的离了 + 
后来他们结了婚 他是一个很棒的丈夫和父亲 + 
不可能有这种事 + 
女人编织的都会感情神话 + 
好让她们自己的感情生活 显得似乎不那么绝望 + 
只可惜这令人更加绝望 + 
因为这种事 绝不会发生在你身上 + 
真的会发生 + 
就像一个和男友分手的女人 决定搬到堪萨斯州 + 
-她走路回家… -下着雨 + 
总是下着雨 + 
他站在门口 手里拿着订婚戒指 + 
他说“嫁给我” 然后他们从此幸福美满 + 
那有可能发生 真的有人过着幸福美满的日子 + 
我朋友阿曼达的朋友就是一例 + 
总是朋友的朋友的朋友… + 
你认识的人中 + 
有谁的感情生活 一夜之间有了极大的改变？ + 
有 + 
凯莉和大人物 他们的关系和以前完全不同 + 
-怎么不同？告诉我 -就是不同 + 
我说不上来…事实上，我可以 但你现在太吓人，所以我不说 + 
不，真的，告诉我 + 
这只是…一个感觉 + 
情况改变了，像是… + 
可能我们都知道我们会复合 + 
一定有它的原因 + 
-为什么这么难相信？ -你有多少时间听我说？ + 
那天下午 我思考神话和感情的关系 + 
英雄、男朋友 独眼巨人、离过婚的男人 + 
他们真的有那么大的差异吗？ + 
远古的希腊人对神话坚信不移 + 
并藉此解释 他们悲惨生活中偶然的绝望 + 
现代的单身男女 是否需要现代神话 + 
好帮助我们度过偶然 而且有时痛苦的恋情？ + 
那大人物和我呢？ + 
在似乎永无止尽的格格不入后 我们突然契合了 + 
是爱神微笑了 或是我需要相信这一点？ + 
我们是否还愿意相信任何事？ + 
尽管莎曼珊对于 “从此幸福美满”心存怀疑 + 
她倒是相信下班后 来杯时髦的鸡尾酒绝对有益 + 
莎曼珊，一杯四海为家 以及唐纳川普 + 
这种事只有在纽约才会发生 + 
听着，艾德，我得走了 + 
考虑一下，我会在川普大楼的 办公室等你消息 + 
不好意思 + 
你的美貌让我分心 + 
我刚同意投资 川普先生新的企划案 + 
-你欠我一亿五千万 -你收支票吗？ + 
-我可以请你喝一杯吗？ -我已经有一杯了，谢谢 + 
我可以买一座小岛给你吗？ + 
-我不知道，你能吗？ -我叫艾德 + 
我是莎曼珊 + 
莎曼珊，你常来这里吗？ + 
亲爱的，这词儿比你还老呢 + 
-你真风趣 -你有所不知 + 
喝了一瓶香槟之后 + 
莎曼珊得知艾德单身 没有对象 + 
而且还是个亿万富翁 + 
-你能接受最老到几岁的男人 -五十 + 
-如果他坐拥数亿家产？ -五十 + 
-我认识一个最可爱的老家伙 -多大年纪？五十？ + 
六十？ + 
-他得参加医疗保险了吗 -我猜是72，但外表很年轻 + 
-你的沉默有歧视老人的意味 -你是认真的吗？ + 
他带我去“尚乔治”吃饭 不需要预约 + 
我不知道他们有 专为老人设计的特餐 + 
他有权势又大方 只是想找人陪他享乐 + 
-那包括闺房之乐吗？ -我们还没讨论这一点 + 
你的意思是你真的能够 和上了年纪的男人做爱？ + 
你知道那句谚语 “所有的猫在黑暗中都一样” + 
这是十足的当代传说 下水道的鳄鱼 + 
微波炉内的宠物 现在则是莎曼珊和老头子交往 + 
这样是一块牛肉 还是这样是一块牛肉？ + 
那是一块牛肉 + 
在每个神话中 凡人都得接受考验 + 
他们回答的方式 决定是否能找到天堂 + 
或者永世不得翻身 + 
我有个很大的请求 我希望你多了解我的朋友 + 
我很了解你的朋友 夏绿蒂是黑发… + 
米兰达是红发… + 
而莎曼珊是麻烦 + 
那我想让她们多了解你 她们没有跟你相处过 + 
你是这么的风趣、可爱 + 
凯莉，你要我怎么样？ + 
我希望星期六晚上 你和我们一起去“否认”吃饭 + 
“否认”是曼哈顿一家 受欢迎的热门餐厅 + 
显然每个人对“否认” 都趋之若鹜 + 
-好 -你怎么突然变得这么… + 
-可爱？ -对，你怎么这么可爱？ + 
你在哪里？我已经等你很久了 + 
你没收到我的留言吗？ + 
你没事吧？我还以为你死了 + 
-我很好，我在大人物家 -你在大人物家？ + 
-你跟我约好今晚一起吃饭的 -他做了牛肉 + 
你为了一块不识时务的牛肉 放我鸽子？ + 
他想做晚餐给我吃 + 
所以你就放下自己的生活 向他飞奔而去？ + 
我现在真的不想谈这个 + 
你知道吗？ + 
你们之间的关系一点也没变 总是以他为主 + 
-可以请米兰达听电话吗？ -好好享受你的牛肉吧 + 
-有问题吗？ -没有 + 
再给我一杯酒 + 
要说请 + 
-什么？ -请再给我一杯酒 + 
你可以那样跟我说话吗？ + 
是的，我想可以，慢用 + 
-谢谢 -谢谢，史蒂夫 + 
很有趣，但我没那个心情 + 
我没那个心情，史蒂夫 + 
我人不坏，只是刚跟人吵完架 + 
我听到了，男朋友？ + 
-那不干你的事 -女朋友？肉贩？ + 
-肉贩？ -你说牛肉，我乱猜的 + 
你在读什么？ + 
“当酒保的乐趣” 海明威写的 + 
那又怎样？表示你很幽默？ + 
慢慢喝 那是好酒，要细细品味 + 
不用了，我请客 + 
-为什么？ -贿赂，你才会留下来聊天 + 
如果你走了，我就得听那些 小伙子讨论费欧娜艾波 + 
我求你 + 
他们不只是聊天 下班后，他们回到她家 + 
酒保史蒂夫为米兰达 接连送上两次高潮 + 
那么… + 
这经验很特别 + 
没错，那是你的上衣吗？ + 
-可以给我你的电话吗？ -为什么？ + 
方便打给你，约你出来 + 
-听着… -听着，史蒂夫 + 
你不必假装会打电话给我 + 
我们都知道这只不过是一夜情 + 
你这个人真妙 + 
有空来酒吧坐坐 + 
当然，随便，谢了 + 
再见…床上功夫不错 + 
三顿晚餐以及两次奢华午餐后 + 
艾德邀请莎曼珊到他家 + 
以前她绝不会相信 + 
自己会考虑跟老男人交往 + 
但艾德与众不同 + 
那东西怎么会跑到那里？ + 
不知道这里… + 
艾德，不会吧 + 
在令人印象深刻的六道菜后 艾德对莎曼珊展开攻势 + 
艾德的攻势年代久远 + 
莎曼珊只有在老电影里见过 + 
但没想到会亲身体验 + 
我过去经常在古巴快活 + 
怎么了，艾德？ 付不起电费吗？ + 
你真幽默，敬幽默一杯 + 
管他的 + 
我就打开天窗说亮话吧 + 
莎曼珊，我时日不多了 + 
顶多10到12年 我想找个陪我一起享乐的人 + 
我知道像你这么美丽的女人 要找怎样年轻的男人都行 + 
所以我愿意给你一点回报 + 
说到野性，别担心 + 
我有的是威而钢 + 
艾德，那可不是威而钢 + 
莎曼珊正在实践 她的都会感情神话 + 
一个下班后喝杯鸡尾酒的女人 从此过着幸福美满的日子… + 
最多10到12年 + 
我想在黑暗中比较性感 + 
能关掉你身后的灯吗？ + 
在黑暗中，她发现所有的猫 不仅看起来一样，感觉也一样 + 
艾德的吻跟一般老男人不同 + 
艾德的抚摸跟一般老男人不同 + 
抱歉，宝贝，我要去厕所 + 
不幸的是 艾德的屁股老态毕露 + 
她告诉他因晚餐吃了贝类食物 而身体不舒服先行告退 + 
米兰达正在享受一杯咖啡 以及阅读纽约时报的悠闲时光 + 
命运却来敲门 + 
-谁？ -史蒂夫 + 
-哪个史蒂夫？ -史蒂夫布莱迪，当酒保的 + 
-你想怎样？ -你想让邻居听到吗？ + 
嗨 + 
-谢谢你让我进来 -你忘了什么吗？ + 
不，我没有你的电话 而我想告诉你…我喜欢你 + 
你的意思是：跟你上床很容易 我想再来一次 + 
不是那样的 + 
-跟我吃晚饭 -为什么？ + 
我不知道，因为肚子饿 + 
我甚至不认识你 + 
-你跟我上过床 -那不一样 + 
今晚可以吗？ + 
-不行，我有计划了 -你才没有计划 + 
-我有 -是什么？快说，免得你骗人 + 
我跟朋友约好在“否认”吃饭 + 
我去找你喝一杯，几点？ + 
七点 + 
你到底跟她们约几点？ + 
九点 + 
八点十五，我到了大人物家 + 
准备很快喝杯酒便出门 + 
我跟自己说只是跟朋友吃顿饭 + 
但当我穿着新买的衣服 站在门外等待 + 
我发现意义远大于此 + 
宝贝，进来吧 + 
你的穿着不适合跟我朋友见面 快去换衣服 + 
关于那件事… + 
你介意我不去吗？ 我在外忙了一天，又快下雨了 + 
可是我的朋友都在等你 + 
我知道，但她们是你朋友 你去就够了 + 
-可以吗？ -当然 + 
我害怕若抬头注视他的眼睛 我会变成石头 + 
我怎么会相信 我们的关系第二次便会好转？ + 
我从未听说过 在都会感情神话中 + 
一个42岁的婴儿 不可思议地变成一个 + 
可以带到公开场合的成熟男人 + 
人没到齐他们不肯带位 大人物还要多久才到？ + 
我不确定，他从公司过来 + 
我无法告诉她们我的坠落英雄 怎么了，至少等我喝一杯再说 + 
只要我在“否认” 我可能会一直待在那里 + 
你看你 + 
如果你想要殷勤的服务 派一个酒保去 + 
如果你想要完美的性爱 就带一个回家 + 
怎么了？这很好笑 + 
米兰达，可以跟你说句话吗？ + 
老天在惩罚我随便和人上床 + 
谢谢 + 
问你一个问题我就走 你为什么这么恨男人？ + 
你说什么？ + 
我们才刚认识 所以我知道你不是针对我 + 
-等一下… -你到底想怎么样？ + 
我只想更进一步了解你 帮我一个忙好吗？ + 
你能不能试着相信 或许我不是个坏人？ + 
或许我是真的喜欢你？ 或许那一晚很特别？ + 
-你能相信吗？ -不能 + 
或许我跟太多酒保上过床了 + 
-你还好吧？ -我不想谈 + 
幸会，失陪了 + 
也许我们应该 要一张四个人的桌子 + 
我就知道，大人物不会来了 男人都是烂货 + 
-别胡说，他会来吧？ -我不知道我是否说得出口 + 
告诉夏绿蒂“从此幸福美满” 真的只是个神话 + 
他来了 + 
-外面雨下的真大 -你还记得我的朋友吗？ + 
我当然记得，你们好 + 
看见大人物为我现身彻底动摇 米兰达对男人的不信任 + 
抱歉失陪 + 
就这样，米兰达离开“否认” + 
史蒂夫 + 
史蒂夫 + 
或许我能相信 + 
从那时起 男女关系复杂的女人 + 
也将诉说着一夜情 变成真感情的故事 + 
至于大人物和我… + 
莎曼珊，告诉我 你有没有跟那老头上床？ + 
从那晚起，我们不再是神话 而开始步入真实 +
