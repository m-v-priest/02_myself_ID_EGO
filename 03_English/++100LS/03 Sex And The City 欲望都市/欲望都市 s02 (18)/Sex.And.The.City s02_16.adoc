My friend Charlotte was dating Dr. Bram Walker... +
a very hard-working orthopedic surgeon. +
Bram? +
What? +
Were you asleep? +
No, no, I was just resting my eyes. +
Oh, my God. +
Okay, I fell asleep for one second. +
Oh, oh, my God, I... +
I've been up since five, I had three carpal tunnels. +
It's very exhaustive reconstructive work. +
He fell asleep when he was making love to me. +
-Oh. -He fell asleep! +
Sweetie, he was tired. +
This has nothing to do with you. +
Has a man ever fallen asleep making love to you? +
No, but I'm sure many of them wanted to. +
I can't believe this happened to me! +
You want some herb tea? How about some herb tea? +
I must be really bad in bed. +
You are not bad in bed. +
Okay, I've got, uh, Constant Comment and Tummy T-- +
Charlotte, honey, you want some Tummy Tamer? +
Of course it's her. +
And I have to say, +
I'm not surprised. +
Ever seen her on a StairMaster? +
Nothing happening below the waist. +
Nada. No sale. +
How can you say that? +
Even if she was bad in bed, which she isn't, +
is it really that important? +
Absolutely. +
Who we are in bed, is who we are in life. +
I never met a man who was bad in bed +
who was good at life. +
And just for the record, in bed, you are... +
Don't make me state the obvious. +
How can you be so sure? +
Well, no one ever took a nap while fucking me and... +
I get affirmations all the time. +
Why, just last week... +
It seems, last week, +
Samantha was invited to dinner +
by a gay couple she'd known for years... +
David and David. +
Well, thanks for a lovely dinner. +
It was fun. +
Well, I have to admit, we have an ulterior motive. +
What? +
We were wondering if you were seeing anybody +
special right now? +
Well, actually, no. +
Do you have a hot guy for me? +
-Hmm? +
Two. +
-No! -Yes! +
We want to have sex with a woman. +
Are you serious? +
Totally, I've always been curious +
what it would be like. +
Neither one of us has ever done it +
and we thought it might be fun. +
And then we were like, well, +
if we were gonna do it with a woman, +
who would it be? +
And then we were like, aw, +
-Samantha. -Totally. +
We decided of all the beautiful women we know, +
you were probably the best in bed. +
Totally. +
-Look at that! +
So I'm thinking about doing it. +
-They're cute, they're healthy. -They're gay! +
You know, for a sex columnist +
you have a very limited view of sexuality. +
Gay as pink suede. +
Wake up! It's 2000. +
The new millennium won't be about sexual labels, +
it'll be about sexual expression. +
It won't matter if you're sleeping with men or women. +
It'll be about sleeping with individuals. +
Or in your case, twos or threes. +
Soon everyone will be pansexual. +
It won't matter if you're gay or straight. +
Just if you're good or bad in bed. +
Exactly. +
That night I got to thinking about bed. +
Are we secretly being graded every time we invite someone +
to join us in it? +
A+, B, D, incomplete. +
Is making love really nothing more than a pop quiz? +
And if sex is a test, +
how do we know if we're passing or failing? +
How do you know if you're good in bed? +
Later that week, I was walking home +
thinking about my own sexual report card when... +
Ow! +
God! What the hell was-- +
-I am-- -What was that? +
Christ, I'm sorry. I-- I didn't see you. +
I just threw my cigarette. +
I thought I was stung by a bee. +
Jesus! +
I-- I'm sorry. +
I did-- Did it leave a mark? +
You can't smoke in the restaurant. +
You know, I'm a smoker. +
Yeah, I'm a smoker too, but come on, pally, +
watch where you throw those things, huh? +
No, it didn't leave a mark. +
As the pain subsided, my mind was free to notice +
how incredibly cute this guy was. +
Look, I am sorry. +
My name's Patrick. Patrick Casey. +
Carrie Bradshaw, burn victim. +
How-- how weird was that? +
I mean, that was-- that was intense. +
But you-- you gotta admit, +
it's a pretty clever way to meet the ladies. +
Oh, so you got a little comedy routine +
going there, huh, Patrick? +
A little bit. +
But listen, I-- I really feel bad. +
So at least let me buy you a cup of coffee +
or some burn salve? +
Not funny yet. +
Sorry. -But it might be... +
after a cappuccino. +
There's a place right around the corner. +
We can smoke there. +
Three Marlboros and two Marlboro Lights later, +
I had learned that Patrick was a composer +
who wrote music for the movies. +
So what type of movies do you compose for? +
Really bad ones. +
You know, +
"I Screamed When I Knew What You Did Last Summer On Elm Street," type. +
Well, as long as you're challenged by what you do. +
Oh, damn it! +
Patrick Casey, whoever you are. +
I'm late. I have to go. +
Aww. +
Thank you for the coffee. +
And maybe one day you'll give me scar tissue again. +
You're great. +
Thanks. +
As I walked away, I started to think. +
How many cute, smart, single smokers +
are there left in the world? +
Seven? +
I decided to do something I almost never do... +
give a man my phone number. +
Hi. This whole burn lawsuit I plan to initiate, +
it might get a little crazy. +
So here is... +
my phone number. +
You'll need that for your attorney... +
Or if you want to have coffee again some time. +
I left feeling great. +
It was such a cute approach. +
How could he not call? +
Come on, how could he not call? +
It's been three days. +
Give him 12 more hours and then send him off +
to the island of lost men. +
Well, I don't wanna send him there, I like him. +
Could you believe that someone actually had the nerve +
to call this color Florentine peach? +
I can't believe you had the nerve +
to spend this much on sheets. +
It's an experiment. +
I'm trying to change my bed Karma. +
I figure if I can make my bed a place I really want to be... +
others will feel the same way. +
Ah! The field of dreams. +
Exactly. If you build it, he will come. +
The thing that gets me is I'm not usually wrong +
about the phone-number-size-up. +
I don't put it out there +
unless I'm pretty damn sure it's coming back. +
I'm either really loving or hating the color. +
He thinks I'm ugly. +
Oh, my God... get a grip. +
A guy doesn't call you for three days and you're ugly? +
What's your point? +
Pillowcase. +
It's amazing. +
We can feel totally good about ourselves, +
and then it all goes out the window +
if the guy doesn't mirror that right back to us. +
This has a little weird thing here. +
Damnit. +
Does everything I bring into this bedroom +
have to have a flaw? +
Ha, ha! +
The next day I was in the village +
looking for the perfect $7 vintage dress +
to go with my $300 shoes, when... +
I had a choice. +
I could turn around and run away, +
or I could smile, be brave, and walk on over. +
Hey, hi. +
So what, Saturday's the day you stand on the street +
and smoke in the village? +
Hi, I'm Carrie. +
We're kind of in the middle of something. +
Oh, right, sure, sure, right. +
Uh, okay, bye. +
I was just on my way to Perry street. +
This is Perry street. +
Bleecker. Bleecker, I meant Bleecker. +
Okay, bye. And goodbye to you, too. +
Carrie! +
Listen, let me explain. I-- +
No, no, no, I'm embarrassed. +
You know, you're obviously, you're in the middle of a thing +
with your lover or whoever, +
-and I'm standing there all-- -No, no, no, I-- +
I'm not gay. +
I'm an alcoholic. +
We were just waiting for a meeting to start. +
and I wanted to introduce you, +
but it's supposed to be anonymous, so... +
Well, you know, I-- I really wasn't getting the gay vibe from you, +
it's just, uh, he was so cute and-- and-- +
-I never called. -Right. +
I was freaked. +
You know, I've only been in the program 11 months +
and my sponsor said I really shouldn't get involved +
with someone for a year, and... +
So... +
Well, okay. +
So, maybe you'll call me in a month. +
It doesn't bother you that I'm an alcoholic? +
No, God, no. +
No, I love alcoholics. +
Hell, I hope to be one someday. +
That was a joke. +
That's not funny, yet. +
But it might be after a cappuccino. +
You know, what the fuck... +
It's only a couple of weeks. +
Would you like to go out on a date sometime? +
I can't think why not. +
You call me. +
So I accepted his kind invitation. +
Because when you think about it, +
aren't we all in recovery from something? +
Drinking? Drugging? +
Our last relationship? +
On our first date, Patrick and I went for coffee. +
Hey, I'm really compulsive. +
If I open up a bag of Chips Ahoy, I-- I gotta eat the whole thing. +
I'm like that with Reese's Pieces. +
Reese's Pieces and shoes. +
Wouldn't the shoes be a little tough on digestion? +
Well, this is me. +
Thank you, Mr. Casey, I had a great time. +
Oh, no, Miss Burn Victim, I had the great time. +
Then, I gave him my very best +
lean-in-and-kiss-me-goodnight move. +
Well, that was... +
Our next date, over dinner, +
he told me about working his 12 steps. +
And after dinner, I stood on my third step +
trying to work him. +
That smell is amazing. What is that? +
Me. +
I'll, uh, call you. +
I couldn't figure it out. +
I knew he wanted me because during my +
lean-in-and-kiss-me goodnight move, +
I'd accidentally on purpose felt his pop-up and say hello. +
So what was going on? +
By the third date I wanted him even more +
than a fistful of Reese's Pieces. +
Well, then, goodnight. +
That was that. I'd hit my humiliation limit. +
And then I thought, +
how many cute, smart, sexy, single, smoking alcoholics +
are there left in the world? +
Five? +
Do you want to come up? +
Yeah. +
But you see, the thing is... +
I-- I've never had sex sober. +
I've always been drunk or high. +
I don't know if I'll be any good. +
Oh, what the hell. +
Let's take it one step at a time. +
Oh! Oh! +
Ahhhh! +
Oh! Woo! +
Oh, sex... +
is amazing. +
It feels so fucking amazing. +
Do other people know about this? +
I mean... whoa! +
Yeah! +
All right! I did it! +
Sex without beer! +
Yeah! +
Woo-hoo! +
Easy, cowboy. +
You! +
What about you! +
You are the best. +
Well, you weren't half bad yourself. +
No! +
You are the best. +
You're the best. +
I aim to please. +
After we have a cigarette, +
can we do it again? +
I'm gonna have a Spanish omelet, +
hash browns, some more coffee, +
and orange juice. +
Oh, and, um, can I have some rice pudding for later? +
Thanks. +
Storing up for winter? +
No, I'm starving. +
Patrick and I... all last night +
and I'm just-- +
No, don't stop, it's okay. +
I mean, just because I'm bad in bed +
doesn't mean everybody has to be. +
Okay, one more time. +
-You are not bad in bed. -Oh, really? +
Has a man ever fallen asleep making love to you? +
No, but I once fell asleep when a guy was doing me. +
It was the ludes. +
It's okay. +
I'm mature enough to realize that +
while I may be good at some things, +
like accessories... +
that I might need help in others like... +
Fucking? +
Making love. +
So... +
I'm taking a class. +
A fucking class? +
-No, a Tantric sex workshop. +
Well, just don't drink any suspicious Kool-Aid +
or put on new Nikes. +
Oh, it's not like that. +
It's taught by this very well respected woman psychologist. +
It's called, "How to Please a Man." +
I know how to please a man. +
You just give away most of your power. +
Look, I have a trainer for the gym. +
I can have a trainer for... +
Fucking? +
Please stop saying that. +
Are you-- are you actually going to do this? +
Yep. +
And, uh, seating was limited, +
so I signed you guys up. +
-Please, please? -I-- I... +
I can't go alone. +
And if Bram ever falls asleep on me again, +
I will die. +
Please, pretty please, +
pretty please with sugar on it? +
Christ, I'm in. +
What the hell, I don't exactly have them hanging from the rafters. +
"How to Please a Man." +
I could teach the damn class. +
All right. +
That night, while David and David got undressed +
and waited for her in the bedroom, +
Samantha began to wonder +
if maybe she was about to go too far. +
Was she actually capable of being this sexually free? +
Or was she getting in over her head? +
She decided, before there were any regrets, +
they should all talk about it a little more. +
Listen, David and David, maybe... +
You look amazing. +
-Just like Jean Harlow in Red Dust . +
Samantha loved the Samantha mirrored at her through the eyes of the David's. +
-What the hell? +
Oh! +
They're so soft. +
I know. +
I can't do this. +
Neither can I. +
But I-- +
We're just getting start-- +
No. Can't. I'm sorry. +
Sorry. +
It's very pretty, but... +
no. +
It's not you. It's us. +
I have an idea. +
Let's all put on our clothes and go out for gelati! +
-Cheesecake. -Whatever. +
Suddenly, Samantha wasn't feeling so good +
about herself in bed. +
Oh, yikes. +
I gotta go or I'm going to be late for the Tantric Workshop thing. +
Oh, baby, you don't need a workshop. +
Mmm, you are amazing. +
Now, come on. Come on. One more time. +
We did it last night and all this morning. +
I could have sex with you morning, noon, and night. Now, come on. +
That's when I realized it. +
Mr. Compulsive wasn't in bed with me... +
More, come on. +
He was in bed with a big bag of Chips Ahoy. +
More. +
The intent of Tantric, +
"Sacred sexuality," +
is to experience and merge with the divine. +
I think Patrick's addicted to me. +
It's like he's replaced drinking with me. +
Yeah, "Program guys" are tough. +
I dated a guy who was in Overeaters Anonymous. +
And every time we had a fight, +
he'd binge eat hot fudge sundaes. +
Shh. +
In other words, ladies, +
to drive your man crazy. +
He wants to have sex all the time. +
It's getting a little out of hand. +
Well, at least he wants to fuck you. +
They were gay. +
So? +
One minute they were interested +
and then, suddenly they weren't. +
What did I do to turn them off? +
Not having a dick would be the thing that you did +
-to turn them off. +
You guys, I'm serious. This is rude. +
And use it to bring any man to his knees +
with love, of course. +
Where was this bitch last night when I needed her? +
Shh. Shh! Be quiet and you might learn something. +
This lady is supposed to be a genius. +
If she's so good, +
why is she having this workshop in her apartment? +
I don't know. +
Tantric sex is not about talk, +
it's about action. +
Delayed action. +
So... +
without further "delay," +
let me introduce my husband... +
Dr. Ronny Shapiro. +
I will demonstrate +
the very effective lingam massage. +
I think I know why we're in an apartment. +
The receiver lies on his back before the giver, naked. +
Genitals clearly exposed for the massage. +
You're not writing. +
Take your time doing this... +
An hour and a half later, +
crippled by our inability +
to look away from a car crash, +
we watched as the Dr. Shapiro illustrated Tantric sex. +
Massage the head of the lingam +
as if you are using an orange juicer. +
Well, there go my good feelings about breakfast. +
Stop it! You're embarrassing me. +
Oh, we're the embarrassing part? +
Now, place your right hand +
on the receiver's root chakra. +
-Root! +
The root chakra is located between +
the anus and the genitals. +
Well, I think that I just got my 50 bucks worth, so... +
Gently rock your hand to awaken this chakra. +
Clinically referred to as perineum. +
Perineum, Not without an engagement ring. +
Will the women who are laughing +
compose themselves? +
-Thank you. +
Orgasm is not the goal of lingam massage, +
but can be a pleasant and very welcome side effect. +
Watch what I'm doing here. +
If you can master this, +
your man will always be faithful. +
Because once they go Tantric, they don't go back. +
You go, girl. +
See that, can you all see this? +
Oh, my God! +
He's gonna-- +
Oh, God. +
And just like that, Miranda got hit by old faithful. +
-Oh! +
What's funny? +
That night, after we talked Miranda in from the ledge, +
I met Patrick for a movie. +
So I was telling my sponsor today how I felt about you, +
and suddenly I realized, +
duh, maybe I should just tell you. +
Oh. +
Carrie... I love you. +
There it was... +
the little phrase every girl is dying to hear +
a week and a half into a relationship. +
Oh, wow. +
Well, thanks and that's, uh, so... +
-Wow. -What? +
Too soon. Is that what you're thinking? +
Well, we have been going out like a minute. +
Oh, fuck that shit. I don't want to play games. +
I'm just trying to own my feelings. +
I-- I love you. I said it. +
Mr. Casey, you do not love me... +
You love you not drinking with me. +
No, I love you. +
Okay, look... +
Gosh, I am, I-- it's-- I'm so flattered, +
but I just think maybe we should, +
we should slow down a little here. +
-What does that mean? +
It just-- it means that, you know, it's-- +
things are going very fast, and I just, +
it-- you know, you have all these new feelings. +
-'Cause you're not drinking-- -No, no, no. +
Don't give me that program bullshit. +
This has nothing to do with drinking. +
I love you. +
Maybe we should spend a little time apart. +
I'll call you tomorrow. +
I'm not coming up? +
Just a couple nights. +
Are you breaking up with me? 'Cause if you break up-- +
Patrick, I'm not, I'm not breaking up with you. +
I'm just going inside. +
So call me tomorrow. +
We'll do something next week, okay? +
What, what am I gonna do now? +
Well, you should go to a meeting. +
And then you go home and call me tomorrow. +
Okay? Goodnight. +
I'll see you next week. +
Go. +
Get yourself some cookies. +
Meanwhile, across town at Charlotte's... +
Oh, my God, Charlotte, what are you doing? +
Oh. Oh, God. +
Oh! Mmm. +
Oh, Charlotte, you are good. +
Sweet Christ. You are good. +
Charlotte considered it +
the best 50 bucks she'd ever spent. +
It cost Miranda a little more, +
but across town in her bed, things were good as well. +
Carrie! +
Patrick, what are you doing? +
Huh? You, you bitch! +
Shit! +
I loved you. +
And you didn't love me. +
You fucking made me date you before the month. +
And now I'm drunk. +
-Shh! -And I don't care! +
-Carrie! +
I love you, Carrie! +
I love you! +
Make love to me! +
What are you doing? +
God, don't take your clothes off. +
My first impulse was to go down and rescue him, +
but as I learned on our second date, +
that would be codependent. +
Still, I felt I had to do something. +
Here, put this on, you'll get a cold. +
I hope I fucking die! +
Quiet, asshole, I'll call the cops! +
Oh, shut the fuck up, dick weed! +
Carrie! +
You were the best fuck I ever had! +
Three weeks later, I got a letter from Patrick, +
saying he was back in the program +
and wanted to make amends. +
I never saw him again, but I always wondered two things... +
Carrie! +
Was he able to stay sober? +
Am I really that good in bed? +
欲望城市 +
（性爱专家凯莉布雷萧） +
“是非对错” +
夏绿蒂这阵子正在与 布莱姆沃克医生交往 +
他是个勤奋的整形外科医生 +
布莱姆？ +
-布莱姆？ -干嘛？ +
你睡着了吗？ +
-没有，我只是在闭目养神 -我的天 +
-好吧，我只睡了一秒钟 -我的天 +
我从五点到现在都没睡 连续做了三个累人的重建手术 +
他和我做爱的时候竟然睡着了 +
他只是累了，这与你无关 +
男人和你做爱的时候 有睡着过吗？ +
没有，我想他们多半都想睡吧 +
-没想到这种事会落到我身上 -你要不要喝点药草茶？ +
-我在床上的表现一定很差劲 -你的表现不差劲 +
我这里有安抚情绪的 还是你想喝缓和腹部的茶？ +
当然是她的关系 这点我完全不惊讶 +
你看她做过踏板运动吗？ 她的腰部以下都没有改变 +
就算她的技巧不高明 这很重要吗？ +
当然重要 床上的表现可以看出一个人 +
我没看过床上表现差劲的男人 在生活中有成就的 +
那你在床上的表现又如何？ +
-这需要我赘言吗？ -你怎么能这么肯定？ +
从来没有男人和我做爱睡着的 +
而且我每次都会得到证实 不过上星期… +
上星期有一对同性恋 请莎曼珊吃饭 +
她认识他们好几年了 +
他们两个都叫大卫 +
谢谢你们邀我晚餐，我很愉快 +
-其实我们是别有用心 -什么？ +
你现在有和谁在交往吗？ +
没有，你们要为我介绍谁吗？ +
有两个 +
-不会吧？ -你猜对了 +
我们想找个女人做爱 +
-你们是说真的吗？ -我一直很想体会那种感觉 +
我们都没和女人做过 那一定很有趣 +
我们想如果要找个女人 要找谁好呢？ +
我们就立刻想到了你 +
我们决定找个我们认识的 最漂亮的女人 +
-你的技巧一定也最出色 -没错 +
我答应他们考虑考虑 毕竟他们都是英俊的猛男 +
-他们是同性恋 -这是对性的一种狭隘的迷思 +
-男同性恋不是正常男人 -拜托，都已经两千年了 +
未来的一千年将是个 以性来表达的时代 +
这与你和男人或女人上床无关 +
-对方只是一个个体 -你现在是在搞三P +
大家很快就会彼此交流 这和是不是同性恋无关 +
-重要的是你在床上的表现？ -没错 +
当晚我便在思考房事的问题 +
我们每次邀人共赴云雨时 是否都被打了分数？ +
诸如甲乙丙等或是不及格？ +
做爱和随堂测验 成了一回事吗？ +
如果性爱是一门测验 我们怎知是否及格了？ +
又怎么知道自己的表现如何？ +
那个星期我都在思考 我的性爱报告 +
搞什么？那是什么东西？ +
抱歉，我没看到你 我刚才在丢烟蒂 +
我还以为被蜜蜂螫了 +
抱歉，烫伤了吗？ +
餐厅里不能吸烟 我又是个老烟枪 +
我也是个老烟枪 但你丢东西应该小心点 +
我没有被烫伤 +
当疼痛消退之后 我才注意到这个人好帅 +
抱歉，我叫派崔克凯西 +
我叫凯莉布雷萧，烫伤患者 +
这种控诉太过强烈了 +
不过这样搭讪倒是挺高竿的 +
-原来这是你演的一出喜剧？ -有点那个意味 +
真的很抱歉 +
我请你喝杯咖啡作为补偿 +
不好笑 不过喝咖啡这提议不错 +
街角有家咖啡店 那里可以抽烟 +
在抽过两、三支烟之后 +
我发现派崔克在做电影配乐 +
你做的是哪种电影？ +
那都是些三流片 +
好比“去年夏天夜惊魂” 之类的电影 +
只要你对电影还有抱负就够了 +
糟糕，派崔克凯西 +
不管你叫什么，我必须走了 +
谢谢你的咖啡 改天我再控诉内心受到的创伤 +
-你真会说话 -谢谢 +
当我离开的时候才想到 +
世上有几个长相与头脑兼具的 单身老烟枪？ +
七个吗？ +
接着我便做出破天荒的举动 给他我的手机号码 +
我这件烫伤诉讼 可能会有点难搞 +
这是我的电话号码 +
你请律师时会用到 +
或许下次可以再请我喝咖啡 +
这招让我自己都得意不已 他不打给我才有鬼 +
都过了三天他怎么还没打来？ +
再等他12小时 到时候就把他踢到荒岛去 +
我不想踢他走，我喜欢他 +
你相信有人把这种颜色 叫做佛罗伦斯桃红吗？ +
你怎么舍得在床单上 花这么多钱？ +
我在做一项试验 改变我的命运 +
我想如果能把床 布置成我的梦想乐园 +
别人也会感同身受 +
-你是说梦想乐土 -没错，所谓心想事成 +
没想到我给了电话的人 竟然不回我电话 +
我都是看准对象才给电话的 +
我现在对这个颜色 还没有明显的喜好 +
-他一定认为我很“爱国” -拜托，别闹了 +
一个家伙三天不打电话给你 你就变成丑女了吗？ +
-你想说什么？ -枕头套给我 +
我们原先都觉得自己很好 +
可是一走出去 男人要是不看我们… +
这实在太荒谬了，该死 +
我费心打理的卧室 竟然还是有瑕疵 +
第二天我在街上找寻廉价洋装 +
好搭配我花三百美金买的鞋子 +
其实我这时候可以转身离去 +
但我却面带微笑 深呼吸一口气就走了过去 +
好好的星期六 你竟然站在大街上抽烟？ +
-你好，我叫凯莉 -我们正在谈事情 +
好的，我了解 +
-再见，我正要去佩里街 -这就是佩里街 +
我是说布利克街 再见，不打搅你们了 +
-凯莉，你听我解释 -不用，我是自找难堪 +
你显然正在和你的爱人谈事情 +
不，我不是同性恋 我只是有酗酒的毛病 +
我们正在这里等着聚会 +
我本来想为你介绍 但是我不能透露会友的名字 +
我并不是觉得你们像同性恋 +
只是他长得很帅，再加上… +
-我没打电话给你 -没错 +
我戒酒已经11个月了 +
我的监护人要我在一年内 不能谈感情 +
好吧，那你一个月后再打给我 +
你不在意我是个酒鬼吗？ +
不会，我喜欢酒鬼 我甚至也想当个酒鬼 +
-我开玩笑的 -一点也不好笑 +
喝杯咖啡也许就不一样了 +
其实也不过只剩下几星期 你改天愿意出去吗？ +
有何不可？你再联络我 +
于是我便接受了他的邀约 +
其实每个人都在戒某些东西 好比戒酒、戒毒 +
甚至是戒上一段感情吗？ +
我们第一次约会是出去喝咖啡 +
我有点强迫症的毛病 只要打开一包洋芋片 +
就一定要整包吃完 +
蕊丝皮鞋一出新款 我也一定会去买 +
吃鞋子不太好消化吧？ +
我家到了 +
谢谢你，凯西先生 我玩得很愉快 +
烫伤小姐，我也过得很愉快 +
于是我示意他给我一个告别吻 +
第二次出去晚餐时他谈了 许多有关音乐的事 +
饭后我站在楼梯上企图勾引他 +
好香，这是什么味道？ +
我 +
我再打电话给你 +
我实在想不通 +
我知道他想要我 因为在我靠近的时候 +
意外的感觉到他的小弟弟 正在对我“举枪致敬” +
但他怎么没采取行动？ +
第三次约会时我对他的渴望 已经超过蕊丝皮鞋了 +
好了，晚安 +
我的羞辱已经到达了极限 +
但我又想到这个世上… +
还剩几个聪明的帅哥？ 五个吗？ +
-你想上去吗？ -想 +
但是我从来没在 清醒的时候做爱过 +
我总是喝得酩酊大醉 我不肯定自己的表现如何 +
管他的，船到桥头自然直 +
性爱真是太神奇了 +
真是不可思议 别人有这种感觉吗？ +
太棒了，我再也不怕做爱了 +
-冷静点，牛仔 -至于你… +
-你真是妙不可言 -你也不差 +
不，你是最棒的 +
我是很努力 +
等我们抽完这根烟… +
可以再来一次吗？ +
我要一份蛋饼、马铃薯煎饼 再来一杯咖啡和柳橙汁 +
稍后再来一份布丁，谢谢 +
-你在准备冬眠吗？ -不，我快饿死了 +
我和派崔克忙了一夜 把我饿坏了 +
你尽管说，我的表现差 不表示你们都要和我一样 +
你在床上的表现一点也不差 +
有人在和你做爱的时候 睡着吗？ +
没有，但我有一次差点睡着 +
无所谓，我是个成年女人 +
我很清楚我对服饰搭配很在行 +
但某些事却需要别人帮助 +
-好比上床？ -做爱 +
所以我去报了一堂课 +
-学习床上技巧吗？ -不，是性爱研讨会 +
你只要别喝什么诡异的饮料 或穿新布鞋就行了 +
讲师是一位 德高望重的心理学家 +
这堂课叫“如何愉悦男人？” +
只要放弃你的权力 就能愉悦男人 +
我到健身房会找教练 当然也可以找人… +
-教你做爱？ -别再说这个字了 +
你真的要去上课？ +
对，人数还有限制 我就帮你们报了名 +
拜托，我不能一个人去 +
布莱姆要是再在我身上睡着 我一定会死，拜托 +
-求求你们，好姐妹 -我去 +
好吧，其实去听听也无妨 +
如何愉悦男人？ 我都可以开班授课了 +
好吧 +
当晚两个大卫先脱了衣服 在卧室里等她 +
莎曼珊才开始犹豫 这次玩得会不会太过火了 +
她能接受这种放荡的性爱吗？ +
还是她只是一时鬼迷心窍？ +
她认为在后悔之前 他们应该再商量一次 +
大卫，我想或许… +
-你真的好美 -就像“红尘”里的珍哈露 +
莎曼珊立刻爱上了 他们眼中的自己 +
试试又有何妨 +
-真软 -没错 +
-我做不下去 -我也是 +
但是我…我们才刚开始 +
不，我做不下去，抱歉 +
抱歉，你的确秀色可餐 但我做不到 +
问题不在你，是在我们 +
不如这样吧？ 我们穿上衣服去吃意大利果冻 +
-或是起司蛋糕 -都好 +
莎曼珊突然对自己丧失了信心 +
我得走了 不然会赶不上那个研习会 +
宝贝，你根本不用听那劳什子 +
你是个中高手，我们再来一次 +
昨晚和今早做得还不够吗？ +
和你整天整夜做爱我也不会腻 +
这时我了解到这个大男人 根本不是和我做爱 +
他是在和一大袋的洋芋片挣扎 +
“坦特罗”的意思就是 神圣的性爱 +
体验神人合一的感受 +
我看派崔克已经迷上我了 他想用我来取代酗酒 +
在戒酒的家伙都很难搞 我和一个暴食症患者交往过 +
我们只要一吵架 他就会开始狂吃圣代 +
换句话说 你能让你的另一半疯狂 +
他整天都想和我做爱 我都快控制不了了 +
-至少他还想碰你 -他们是同性恋 +
那又怎样？前一秒还兴致高昂 下一秒就没了兴致 +
我到底做错了什么？ +
错就错在你没有老二 +
姐妹们，这太没礼貌了 +
你可以用爱让任何一个男人 对你俯首称臣 +
我昨晚需要她的时候 这个女人在哪里？ +
安静听你们就会学到东西 她是这方面的天才 +
她如果真的这么行 +
-干嘛在公寓里开这个研习会 -不要问我 +
“坦氏性爱”不重理论 而重于行动 +
我们也要为大家示范 +
现在就立刻开始 +
容我介绍我的先生 +
罗尼莎菲洛博士 +
由我来示范… +
最有效的生殖器按摩术 +
我终于明白为什么在这开课了 +
接受按摩者必须赤裸的 躺在按摩者前方 +
让生殖器完全曝露出来 +
你根本没在做笔记 +
按摩需要耐心 +
如果是车祸一个半小时后 或许还看不到车祸的真相 +
但这对夫妇却呈现了 坦氏性爱的效果 +
把你的手当成果汁机一样 按摩龟头部分 +
我早上吃的东西快吐出来了 +
别吵了，别丢我的脸好吗？ +
现在丢脸的是我们吗？ +
接着抬起右手 +
握住对方的命根子 +
命根子 +
它就位在肛门和外生殖器之间 +
看来这五十元美金很值得 +
轻轻的唤醒这个部分 +
这个部位在医学上叫做会阴 +
在拉丁语的意思就是 “结婚一定要有婚戒” +
请那位在笑的小姐安静，谢谢 +
高潮虽然不是这种按摩的目的 +
却是种非常愉悦的副作用 +
请各位注意 +
只要掌握住诀窍 保证男人会永远效忠于你 +
因为他们只要做过这种按摩 就永远忘不了 +
加油 +
看到没？看清楚了没有？ +
我的天，他快要… +
米兰达还被他的精液喷到了 +
有这么好笑吗？ +
那天稍晚我和派崔克去看电影 +
我今天和监护人谈起 我对你的感觉 +
我觉得我应该告诉你 +
凯莉 +
-我爱你 -老实说 +
这是每个女人在交往之后 +
都想听到的一句话 +
谢谢你，我真的觉得… +
你觉得进展得太快了吗？ +
我们只交往了几天而已 +
可是我不想玩游戏 我只想忠于自己的感觉 +
我爱你 +
凯西先生，你并不是爱我 而是爱上清醒的感觉罢了 +
不，我爱你 +
你听我说… +
我真的受宠若惊 +
我们或许该放慢一点 +
-什么意思？ -事情发展得太快了 +
你初次体验到不喝酒的感觉 +
不，别对我说这些聚会的说辞 +
这件事和喝酒无关 +
我爱你 +
或许我们该分开几天 +
-我明天打电话给你 -我不能上楼去吗？ +
-忍耐几晚就好了 -你要和我分手吗？ +
派崔克，我不是要和你分手 我只是要进屋去 +
你明天打电话给我 我们下星期再碰面好吗？ +
-那我现在怎么办？ -你应该去聚会了 +
然后回家，明天打电话给我 +
晚安，下星期见 +
走吧 +
买点饼干来吃 +
这时候夏绿蒂正在家里… +
夏绿蒂，你在做什么？ +
夏绿蒂，你真棒 我的天，你真棒 +
夏绿蒂认为那是她花过 最值得的五十元美金 +
米兰达花的钱虽然比较多 但结果也不错 +
凯莉 +
派崔克，你在做什么？ +
-你这个臭婆娘 -该死 +
我爱你，你却不爱我 +
你让我在完成戒酒前一个月 就和你约会 +
现在我又开始酗酒了 我不在乎 +
凯莉，我爱你 +
我爱你，和我做爱 +
你在做什么？别把衣服脱掉 +
我第一个念头是冲下去救他 +
但我在和他第二次出去时知道 这会变成一种惯性 +
但我还是想做点什么 +
把这穿上，你会着凉的 +
我真希望我死掉 +
-你再不安静我就报警 -你给我闭嘴 +
凯莉，你是我上过最棒的女人 +
三星期后派崔克写了封信给我 说他又回去戒酒了 +
之后我没有再见过他 但我一直在想两件事情 +
一是他戒酒有没有成功？ 还有我在床上真的这么棒吗？ +
