In life, certain events come along so rarely, +
that when they do, +
special attention must be paid. +
Events like Halley's comet, solar eclipses, +
getting that second latte for free. +
And one night at a salsa club +
in very downtown Manhattan, +
four single girlfriends all found themselves +
without a relationship at the exact same time. +
She's not bad. +
Here's to us, without men. +
-Wooh! Here, here. +
I'm not toasting to that, it's bad luck. +
Ha! +
If I end up old and alone, it's all your fault. +
Oh, Charlotte, sweetie, we're all alone, +
even when we're with men. +
Yeah, you tell her, Mr. Sister. +
My advice to you, is to embrace that fact, +
slap on some armor and go through life like I do. +
Enjoying men but not expecting them to fill you up. +
Except when, well, you know... +
We know, we know, we know. +
Excuse me, I was wondering if you'd like to dance. +
Oh, well, thanks, but tonight it's just us girls. +
I'm William, +
one of the club owners. +
Samantha. +
If you ever feel like a dance, we could have some fun. +
I'm impressed, not dumping us for a guy. +
Is that the kind of girl you think I am? +
-Well... -Oh, you guys, I gotta go, I'm getting my picture taken +
for that magazine article in the morning. +
What magazine article? +
All press needs to be cleared through me. +
It's New York Magazine , +
they're doing a profile of 20 Manhattan singles, +
and it's called "Single and Fabulous". +
Why wasn't I picked? +
I'm single and I'm definitely fabulous. +
Well, I was picked because Stanford's new boyfriend, Nevin... +
-Nevin? -...is the assistant photo editor. +
No, Carrie, you cannot leave, we never go dancing. +
-Come on, one more drink. -All right, one drink. +
One. One drink. +
To hot men. +
One drink turned into many, +
and before I knew it, +
I was dragging my tired, +
yet single and fabulous ass home at dawn. +
Ho! +
I decided my best bet +
to avoid looking like I'd been up all night +
was to stay up all morning. +
It's Stanford, you're 40 minutes late. +
I'm at the photo shoot and everyone's freaking out! +
I'm there, 20 minutes. +
-20 minutes? -I said 20 minutes! +
Oh, God, I could not get a cab. +
So what did you do, +
grab on to a bumper and let one drag you here? +
Oh, stop, I was up all night. +
And I need a coffee the size of my head. +
Um, Carrie, this is Nevin. +
Oh, gosh, hi. +
Stanford has told me so much about you. +
It's really nice to finally meet you. +
Hello, you're about a fucking month late! +
Follow me. +
-Jesus! -Don't look at me, +
you're the one who's about a fucking month late. +
My poncho! +
-Hi, I am so, so sorry. -It's fine. +
-Could you sit? -Sure. +
Oh, we're gonna-- There's gonna be time for makeup, right? +
-Yeah. -Thank God! +
I just wanna do a few test shots +
before I check the lighting. +
Hey, coffee, please. +
Oh, do you mind if I smoke? +
I don't care if you shoot up. +
Listen, I never keep people waiting. +
I just-- I got to bed really late last night. +
And it's my personal belief, I lapsed into a coma. Mmm. +
-Oh, thank you. -They only had decaf. +
What? +
Being single and fabulous +
also frees up one's weekends. +
Saturdays usually spent browsing with him in SoHo +
are left to more practical things like power walking +
with your single and fabulous girlfriends. +
We're walking way too slow. +
We're not burning off anything. +
Let's gossip to get our heart rates up. +
Hey, Miranda. +
Josh, hey, hi, how are you? +
Good, great, training for the marathon. +
Right, right, I forgot you do that. +
Five years in a row. +
Well, you got my number, so, give me a call. +
Cute, who's that? +
An ophthalmologist I once faked orgasms with. +
Okay, we're officially stopping... +
The idea that Miranda would fake anything +
stopped me cold. +
I only slept with him twice. +
The first time I faked it +
because it was never gonna happen. +
And the second time I had to fake it because I faked it the first time. +
Oh, naturally. +
And I didn't wanna fake it again, +
so I forgot to return his last call. +
You broke up with an ophthalmologist over that? +
Orgasm, major thing in a relationship? +
Yeah, but not the only thing. +
Orgasms don't send you Valentine's day cards, +
and they don't hold your hand in a sad movie. +
Mine do. +
You're seriously advocating faking? +
No, but if you really like the guy, +
what's one little moment of "ooh, ooh", +
versus spending the whole night in bed alone? +
These are my options? +
And who's to say that one moment +
is any more important than when he gets up +
and pours you a cup of coffee in the morning? +
Let's go! +
I'll take an orgasm +
over a cup of French drip Colombian any day. +
See, for me, it's a toss-up. +
Hey, the usual, please. +
Having smoked all my cigarettes +
during our workout, +
I stopped for fresh supplies when... +
There I was. +
Hanging right next to Martha Stewart Living. +
Carrie Bradshaw, dying of embarrassment. +
"Single and Fabulous", question mark? +
There was no question mark implied. +
I would never have agreed to be in an article +
"Single and Fabulous", question mark. +
-I was set up. -Oh, I agree. +
You're single, fabulous, and fucked. +
Not after that picture, I won't be. +
They said "Single and Fabulous" exclamation point. +
They did not say "Single and Fabulous" question mark. +
That question mark is hostile. +
Miranda, can't we sue them or something? +
For what, mispunctuation? +
It's too late to sue. I'm all over the city looking like, +
like something that got caught in a drain. +
Okay, you know what? I just quit smoking. +
"Single was fun at 20. +
But you wanna ask these women, +
how fun will all night club hopping be at 40?" +
-Who's out all night? -Who's 40? +
Do you know what I say? +
Fuck them, exclamation point. +
Fuck them! +
Yeah, fuck them! +
Charlotte said fuck. +
Every couple of years, +
an article like this surfaces as a cautionary tale +
to scare young women into marriage. +
Oh, I'm a cautionary tale? Shoot me. +
"Filling their lives with an endless parade +
of decoys and distractions to avoid the painful fact +
that they're completely alone." +
How is that helping? +
This piece of trash has nothing, +
I repeat, nothing to do with us. +
Exactly, we are single and fabulous. +
Absolutely. +
But I had a sneaking suspicion +
they didn't quite believe it. +
Somehow, the question mark had leapt off my cover +
and onto each of them, +
because, within a week... +
Ooh, oh! +
Miranda met Josh for old time's sake. +
Oh. Oh! +
Samantha met William for a dance. +
And Charlotte met a deadline head on. +
So, I'm moving to Salt Lake City. +
What? Why? +
The acting thing in New York is definitely not happening, you know... +
I have a chance to get on a Christian soap opera +
if I move out west. +
Wow, a Christian soap opera? +
Yeah. +
"The Days of our Mormon Lives" or some shit. +
Hand me the receiver cable. +
The... jeez. +
What are you gonna do around here without me? +
Tom was an out of work actor friend +
Charlotte had come to depend on to do the occasional male things +
she needed done around her apartment. +
Because he was an out of work actor, +
he had a lot of time. +
And because he had a lot of time, +
he had a lot of tools. +
Okay, that is the VCR. +
After I rewire your lamp, I'm out of here. +
Unless you have something else you need done. +
Charlotte made a decision. +
She decided she wasn't gonna let her Mr. Fix-it get away. +
While women are certainly no strangers to faking it, +
we faked our hair color, cup-size, hell, +
we've even faked fur, +
I couldn't help but wonder, +
has fear of being alone +
suddenly raised the bar on faking? +
Are we faking more than orgasms? +
Are we faking entire relationships? +
Is it better to fake it than be alone? +
Well, you know, my boyfriend and I were really compatible. +
Except for one thing. +
He liked thin, blond, waspy types, so... +
Now I am. +
I think my wife's an idiot. +
Every day with her +
is like a trip to idiot island. +
I don't tell her how I really feel. +
I'm pretty sure she'd leave me. +
I don't understand sign language. +
A glamorous city like New York +
offers a sea of single and fabulous things +
for the fabulous and single to do. +
As long as that magazine's on the newsstand, +
I'm not going out in public +
for fear of being scorned and chased with sticks. +
Hey, one, one! +
I'm not smoking. +
Look at this, he climbs on top of her, +
and the next thing you know, she's coming. +
No wonder men are so lost. +
They have no idea there's more work involved. +
So, still faking it? +
-Yep. -Is he that bad in bed? +
No, he's just... he's a guy. +
They can rebuild a jet engine, +
but when it comes to a woman... +
What's the big mystery? +
It's my clitoris, not the sphinx! +
I think you just found the title for your autobiography. +
You know, it's really not their fault. +
They don't come with a manual. +
If I had a son, I'd teach him all about the vagina. +
If you had a son, we'd call social services. +
The other night, he told me +
he really likes that I can come while he's fucking me. +
How can he actually believe that that's all it takes? +
Because you're faking it! +
I'm really hating myself right now. +
Could you please just tell me why? +
He's a nice guy. He means well. +
Oh, so it's codependent coming. +
Oh, well, I have to go. I got a date. +
I'm meeting William after work, and then, who knows? +
But from the way he dances, +
I'm fairly certain I won't have to fake anything. +
This is a great club. +
Wait until you see my club in the Hamptons. +
Salsa East. +
Do you like the Hamptons? +
No, love, love the Hamptons. +
I'm renting a great house in East Hampton. +
We can go out on the weekends. +
We can go sailing, +
and cook big old lobsters. +
We can walk on the beach. +
At first Samantha listened, +
fascinated, detached. +
It was rare to hear a man use the "we" word +
so comfortably so early on. +
Or we could just lay around and do this. +
Whatever we want. +
But pretty soon she gave in. +
She lay back, opened up, and let the "we" wash over her. +
-Hello. Guess where I'm spending the summer? +
I don't know, Gucci? +
East Hampton. +
William's renting a house, +
and he asked me to spend the summer with him. +
Isn't it a little early? +
Honey, no. +
All the great places are taken by January. +
No, I mean early in the relationship. +
You should have heard him last night. +
"We" can cook, "we" can swim. +
Oh, he's a "we" guy. +
Oh, so he's a "we" guy, who cares? +
We are going to spend the summer in East Hampton +
and the "we" I'm referring to right now, +
is you and me. +
They say that every great actor +
knows when to stop performing. +
I'm getting close, come with me. +
Oh, come with me. +
For Miranda Hobbes, +
it was that Saturday night at exactly 10:40. +
Ooh! Come with... +
Ohhh... +
Oh, God. +
Wow. +
Hey, is everything all right? +
Mm-hmm. +
Are you sure? +
'Cause you didn't cum. +
Did you? +
-No. -Oh. +
Did I do something wrong tonight? +
'Cause, I mean, you came every other time. +
What? Hey, tell me. +
Well, I didn't exactly cum all those other times. +
You faked it? +
Well, how many of the other times? +
All of the other times? +
Oh, do you have like a physical problem or something? +
Me? What makes you assume it's me? +
Oh, no offense, it's just... +
Nobody I've ever slept with has had to, you know, fake it. +
You know, a lot of women fake it, +
and up until five minutes ago, +
you didn't know that I was faking it, so... +
Well, what are you saying? +
All the women I've ever slept with have been faking it? +
What are you looking at? +
Nothing. I was just running a list in my head. +
Look, Josh, a woman's anatomy is a little more complicated-- +
Hey, hey, I know all about a woman's anatomy. +
I'm a doctor. +
You're an eye doctor. +
Okay, give me some tips. +
-Pardon me? -Tips, tips to get you off. +
I am nobody's charity case. +
I run the marathon for Christ's sake. +
Okay, well, do you know how the clitoris works? +
-Yes. -Do you know where it is? +
-Yes. -Well, it's about two inches +
from where you think it is. +
Oh, my God. +
Relax, I'll show you. +
Later that week, +
I went over to Charlotte's +
to see some of Tom's handiwork. +
So after we finish in here with the lighting, +
we're gonna start in on the kitchen, +
we're gonna re-tile everything. +
First Samantha and now Charlotte went +
"we", "we", "we", all about her home. +
Well, that's amazing! +
How are you gonna get all that done before you leave? +
-I'm not leaving. -Oh. +
I've decided to stay. +
I have to go over to my place and get a voltmeter. +
-All right? -Okay. +
I'll be right back, okay? +
Bye, honey. +
"Bye, honey"? +
Yeah. +
When he told me he was leaving, +
I suddenly had all these feelings, +
like, what if he was the one? +
He'd been right under my nose the entire time +
and I'd never even seen him. +
I let the whole, "almost 40, out of work actor thing" +
get in the way. +
But Carrie, he is strong, and masculine, +
and he can fix things around the house. +
Charlotte, you can't create a relationship +
with a guy just because he can caulk your tub. +
Yes, you can. +
As I walked home, I couldn't help but wonder, +
when did being alone become the modern-day equivalent +
of being a leper? +
Will Manhattan restaurants +
soon be divided up into sections? +
Smoking, non-smoking, single, non-single? +
Yeah, the usual, please. +
And then I had a frightening thought. +
Maybe I was the one who was faking it. +
All these years faking to myself that I was happy being single. +
Yes, it's me. +
And there it was, pity. +
Pity from the man who sells me my Marlboro Lights. +
It was the final straw. +
I decided I wasn't gonna let a magazine, +
or my friends, or the surgeon general +
stop me from being who I was, +
single and fabulous, exclamation point. +
-Tartini? -Excuse me? +
Tartini, cranberry-flavored vodka. +
-Tartini. -Oh, Christ. +
I've been out of commission for four days, there's a new drink? +
I'd invited Stanford to join me +
at a fabulous party downtown +
to honor the fabulous conceptual photographer, +
Ellen von Unwerth. +
Unfortunately, he invited his new boyfriend, +
Nevin von Bitchy. +
Hi, I hate you. +
Join the club, I hate me, too. +
I'm so sorry about the cover. +
-I had nothing to do with it. -Who cares? +
Next week you'll have a coke-dealing slumlord +
on the cover, and I'll be history. +
You are fabulous. +
Excuse me. +
You realize you're going to have to dump him. +
I can't, we're getting a summer share in Sagaponack. +
Tartini! +
While Stanford and I did downtown... +
Samantha was uptown, waiting for William +
at her favorite romantic restaurant. +
Alone? +
No, I'm waiting for someone. +
At first she thought she had the wrong time. +
But when he still wasn't there 20 minutes later, +
she called her machine. +
No message. +
I don't know what's keeping him. +
Could you ask the waiter to bring me a red wine? +
She hadn't expected to be caught out in public alone +
without a book, or a project, +
or any of her dining-out-alone armor. +
She had nothing to do but sit and wait for him. +
By now, she knew that "we" William +
wasn't ever going to show up. +
He was one of those men who faked a future +
to get what he wanted in the present. +
More water? +
No, no more water. +
She felt exposed, vulnerable, like a fool. +
Oh! +
My God, people are looking. +
-I'm so embarrassed. It's okay, it's okay. +
Where's the ladies'... +
This way. +
Show me the ladies' room. +
You okay? +
Thank you. You're very sweet. +
I'm not usually like this. +
I can't believe I fell for some guy's line. +
But, sometimes you just need to hear "we". +
You know? +
Samantha let the Pakistani busboy kiss her. +
After all, he'd been so sweet and attentive with the bread. +
You take me home, you're not alone. +
As Samantha looked into his sweet and hopeful eyes, +
she realized something. +
No matter how much it hurts, +
sometimes it's better to be alone than fake it. +
Meanwhile, downtown... +
I just heard the funniest thing I'd ever heard +
from a man I just met. +
Oh, my God. I'm sorry, oh, your pants... +
I'm sorry. +
It's fine. -God, I'm sorry. +
Well, fuck you! +
Exclamation point. +
Okay, you little tartini, time to go home. +
-What? -You've had enough. +
Oh, c'mon, it's early. +
It's 2:00 a.m. on a Tuesday. +
Oh, Stanford, just go. +
Go, go, go home, +
take your tired, fabulous ass home. +
I want to meet cute guys. +
Everyone here is gay, gay, gay. +
I don't think so. +
You need a light? +
His name was Jake. +
He was everything I was looking for that night. +
Single, straight, and a smoker. +
There wasn't quite as much smoke uptown. +
How's that? Ooh! Is that better now? +
Oh, how about now, how about now? +
Miranda's two-day tutorial with her ophthalmologist +
had turned lovemaking into a kind of naked eye exam. +
Maybe we should just +
try and let it happen for a second. +
-I wanna do it right. -Yeah. +
Oh, oh, how's that, how's that? +
Even with all Josh's good intentions, +
Miranda found herself no closer. +
She realized she was not a jet engine. +
She was a lot more complicated. +
It would never work between them. +
I'm close, I'm close. Are you close? I'm close. +
She wanted to give him something +
for learning so much and trying so hard. +
So, Miranda came. +
She came out of retirement for one final performance. +
-Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! +
I'm the man. +
Oh! +
-Hey! -Hey! +
You wanna go for a ride in my Porsche? +
Fabulous. +
I need some smokes. +
Do you want anything? +
I'll be right back. +
Hey, how you doing? +
I want a pack of Marlboro Lights. +
I looked at myself in the mirror. +
What had I been so afraid of all week? +
I was still young, still desirable. +
I would never wind up alone. +
Is this you? +
And there it was. +
My question mark staring me right in the face. +
Was that me? +
And then I realized, if I went home with him, +
it would be the only time I'd ever slept with a man +
to validate my life. +
The question mark would no longer be a question, +
it would be a fact. +
You know what, I gotta go home. +
No way, I'm not letting you out. +
Fine. +
Charlotte... +
I think I should go to Salt Lake City. +
Give it a try. +
Oh, no, really? +
Charlotte was faking it. +
She'd realized two days ago +
that while she had no problem +
with the idea of faking orgasms, +
she could never fake intimacy. +
My heart's still in acting. +
I'm not ready to let it go. +
Tom was faking, too. +
He was mostly just sick of New York +
and needed an excuse to leave. +
I'll miss you. +
I'll miss you, too. +
It was a perfectly timed double fake. +
Under any other circumstances, they could have shared a very long life together. +
Over the next week, things pretty much returned to normal. +
Miranda, babe, it's Josh. +
I'm home, give me a call. +
Miranda forgot to return Josh's last call. +
Samantha made peace with her feelings +
about "we" William, +
and Charlotte learned you don't have to rely +
on men's affections +
to get things fixed around the house. +
You can pay them. +
And as for me, after I was recycled, +
I decided instead of running away +
from the idea of a life alone, +
I'd better sit down and take that fear to lunch. +
Waiting for someone? +
Oh, no, it's just me. +
Thanks. +
So, I sat there +
and had a glass of wine, +
alone. +
No books, no man, no friends, no armor, +
no faking. +

，单身有罪？ +
人生有某些事难得一见 +
一旦发生了便得特别注意 +
像是哈雷慧星、日蚀 +
免费拿铁续杯 +
有一晚，在曼哈顿下城 一家具拉丁风格的夜总会 +
四名单身女子发现她们 +
同时都没有男友 +
-敬没有男人的我们 -我才不干杯，这是厄运 +
若我最后孤独终老 便是你的错 +
就算有男友我们也一样孤独 +
你跟她说吧 +
我给你一个忠告 欣然接受现实 +
学学我的人生观：享受男人 但别指望他们填补你的空虚 +
-除了…你知道的 -我们知道 +
你想跳支舞吗？ +
谢了 但今晚是我们姐妹的聚会 +
-我是威廉，本店的老板之一 -我是莎曼珊 +
如果你想跳舞 我们可以一起玩 +
我好感动 你竟然没有见色忘友 +
-你以为我是那种人吗？ -我得走了 +
明天早上杂志要帮我拍照 +
什么杂志？要得我通过才行 +
纽约杂志要制作20位 曼哈顿单身者的专题报导 +
-名为“单身贵族” -为什么不选我？ +
史丹佛的新男友是助理编辑 +
你不能走，我们很少一起跳舞 +
-好吧，再喝一杯 -敬…热情的男人 +
一杯变成了许多杯 在我意识到这事实前… +
我在黎明时份 拖着疲累的身体回家 +
为了避免看起来 像整晚没睡的样子 +
我决定保持清醒 +
我是史丹佛，你已迟到 40分钟，大家都快抓狂了 +
我20分钟内赶到，我说20分钟 +
-我叫不到计程车 -所以你才这么慢吞吞？ +
我整晚没睡 我需要喝一大杯咖啡 +
凯莉，这是奈文 +
史丹佛跟我说了好多你的事 +
你好，你他妈的真会迟到 跟我来 +
别看我，谁叫你要迟到 +
帮我拿披风 +
-我真的很抱歉 -你可以坐着吗？ +
有时间让我化妆吧？ +
-谢天谢地 -我先拍几张照片作测试 +
我要咖啡 +
-你介意我抽烟吗？ -就算你开枪我也不介意 +
我从不让人枯等 我太晚上床了 +
我想我陷入了昏睡状态 +
-谢谢 -只有卖低咖啡因的 +
身为单身贵族，周末便有空闲 +
往常和男友打发时间的星期六 +
变成跟同样是单身贵族的朋友 做快走运动 +
我们走得太慢了 +
来讲八卦让心跳加速一下吧 +
-米兰达 -乔许，你好吗？ +
很好 我正为马拉松比赛做训练 +
-对，我都忘了 -连续五年了 +
打电话给我 +
他是谁？ +
一个曾让我 假装高潮的眼科医生 +
暂停一下 +
米兰达会假装任何事 真是出乎我意料 +
我只跟他上过床两次 +
我第一次假装是因没达到高潮 而第二次便得继续假装 +
我不想再装下去 所以没回他电话 +
你们就为了这原因分手？ +
高潮在一段感情中十分重要 +
是没错，但高潮不会送你卡片 +
或在看悲剧电影时握着你的手 +
你真的主张伪装？ +
如果你喜欢他，叫个一分钟 +
和孤枕难眠要选哪个？ +
只有这两个选择吗？ +
难道高潮比他在早上 +
为你冲一杯咖啡还重要？ +
我宁愿要高潮 而放弃一杯法式滴滤咖啡 +
对我来说，这很难决定 +
老牌子 +
由于烟都抽完了 我停下来补货，却发现… +
我就在那里… +
挂在“玛莎史都华生活”旁边 +
凯莉布雷萧，死于极度困窘 +
“单身贵族加问号？” +
我绝不会同意出现在标题是 “单身贵族加问号”的文章内 +
-我被设计了 -你确实是迷人的单身贵族 +
那张照片登了之后就不是了 +
他们说是单身贵族加惊叹号 而非单身贵族加问号 +
那个问号充满敌意 +
-不能告他们吗？ -什么罪名？打错标点符号？ +
我看起来像是 从排水管捞起来的模样 +
我要戒烟了 +
“20岁单身很棒，但40岁时 整晚在夜总会狂欢有趣吗？” +
-谁整晚在外面玩？ -谁40岁？ +
去他们的，惊叹号 +
-去他们的 -没错，去他们的 +
-夏绿蒂说脏话 -每隔几年 +
就会有个警世故事 来惊吓年轻女孩走入婚姻 +
我成了警世故事？杀了我吧 +
“她们以无止尽的娱乐 填满生活” +
“藉此逃避她们孤独的事实” +
念那个有什么用？ 这篇垃圾跟我们没关系 +
-没错，我们是单身贵族 -完全正确 +
我怀疑她们并不相信这句话 +
封面的问号已潜入她们心中 +
在一周之内… +
看在往日旧情的份上 米兰达又和乔许见面了… +
莎曼珊和威廉共舞… +
而夏绿蒂面临了感情的临界点 +
-我要搬去盐湖城 -什么？为什么？ +
我在纽约无戏可拍 +
如果搬去西部，便有机会演出 一部基督教肥皂剧 +
基督教肥皂剧 +
“摩门教徒的时代” +
把接收器的电线给我 +
少了我你该怎么办？ +
汤姆是个失业的演员 夏绿蒂依赖他 +
为她的公寓 做一切需要男人干的活 +
因为失业，所以他时间很多 +
因为他时间很多 于是他的工具也多 +
录影机装好了 +
我帮你换好灯之后就走 +
除非还有什么需要做的事 +
夏绿蒂决定 不让她的修理先生离开 +
女人对于伪装毫不陌生 +
我们戴假发、改变肤色 谎称罩杯尺寸，连毛皮都作假 +
对于孤单的恐惧是否 已突然提高伪装的标准？ +
我们不只是伪装高潮吗？ 我们是否整段恋情都在伪装？ +
伪装比孤单好吗？ +
我男友和我很合得来 除了一件事 +
他喜欢纤细的金发女子 所以…现在我成了这模样 +
我太太是个白痴 每天都像是去白痴岛一日游 +
我没告诉她我真正的感觉 我肯定她会离开我 +
我看不懂手语 +
像纽约这样的城市 +
为单身贵族提供许多消遣 +
只要那本杂志还在市面上贩售 我就不去公共场合 +
我不抽烟 +
他才刚趴到她身上 下一秒她就达到高潮了 +
男人不知道这还得下许多工夫 +
-你还在假装 -他有那么差劲吗？ +
不，他只是…他是个男人 +
他们会改造喷射引擎 但一面对女人… +
有这么难以理解吗？ 只不过是我的阴蒂，不是猜谜 +
听来像是你的自传 +
这不是他们的错 他们并非生来带着一本说明书 +
如果我有儿子 我会教他认识阴道所有的构造 +
如果你有儿子 我们会通知社福单位 +
他告诉我他真的很喜欢 我跟他做爱时达到高潮 +
他怎能相信 只要这么一点努力就能完成？ +
-因为你在假装 -现在我恨死自己了 +
告诉我你为何这么做 +
-他是个好人，他很善良 -所以这算是礼尚往来？ +
我得走了，我和威廉约好见面 接下来，谁知道？ +
从他的舞姿看来 我不必伪装任何事 +
这是个很棒的夜总会 +
等你看过 我在汉普顿的夜总会再说 +
-你喜欢汉普顿吗？ -不，我爱死汉普顿了 +
我在那里租了一栋别墅 周末时我们可以去玩玩 +
我们可以乘船出海 +
我们可以烹调大龙虾 我们可以在沙滩漫步 +
一开始，莎曼珊听得入神 +
很少听到男人 这么快就把“我们”挂在嘴边 +
或者我们可以一直做这件事 +
什么都行 +
不久她便投降 躺下来，奉献自己 +
让“我们”在她身上漫游 +
你猜我要去哪里过夏天？ +
-古驰名店？ -东汉普顿 +
威廉邀我和他一起去过夏天 +
这不会太早吗？ +
所有好房子在一月就被订光了 +
我是说以你们交往的程度 +
你应该听听他昨晚说的话 我们可以下厨、我们可以游泳 +
-他是“我们”一族的男人？ -谁在乎？ +
我们将去东汉普顿过夏天 +
而这里的“我们”是指你和我 +
所有好演员都知道 何时该停止表演 +
我快到达高潮了 跟我一起来吧 +
对米兰达而言，星期六晚上 10点40分便是时候 +
跟我一起… +
一切都还好吗？ +
你确定？因为你没达到高潮 +
-你有吗？ -没有 +
今晚我做错什么了吗？ +
以前你每次都达到高潮 +
怎么了？告诉我 +
我并非每次都达到高潮 +
你是装出来的？有几次？ +
每一次 +
你身体有毛病吗？ +
你凭什么认为是我的问题？ +
无意冒犯，只是以前 跟我上过床的女人都不必假装 +
很多女人都会假装高潮 我不说你根本不知道我在假装 +
你的意思是 跟我上过床的女人都是装的？ +
你在看什么？ +
没有，我只是在脑中浏览名单 +
女人身体的构造比较复杂 +
我知道，我是个医生 +
你是眼科医生 +
-给我一点诀窍 -你说什么？ +
让你达到高潮的诀窍，我不要 别人同情，我可是马拉松好手 +
你知道阴蒂有何作用吗？ +
你知道它在哪里吗？ +
它的位置比你所想的 还要深两英寸左右 +
放轻松，我让你瞧瞧 +
那一周，我去夏绿蒂家 看汤姆精湛的手工艺 +
我们把灯装好之后 我们要在厨房重新铺瓷砖 +
现在夏绿蒂谈到她的房子 也满口都是“我们” +
你走之前怎么做得完？ +
我不走了，我决定留下来 +
我得去拿电压计 +
-我马上回来 -再见，亲爱的 +
“再见，亲爱的”？ +
当他说要离开时 我突然对他有了感觉 +
他一直在我身边 我却没发现他的存在 +
我让“失业演员”的阴影 妨碍了我们的发展 +
他强壮又有男子气概 他会修这屋里的东西 +
你不能因为一个男人 会修你的浴缸就跟他交往 +
可以 +
我忍不住纳闷 +
何时孤单一人 变成了现代受排斥的对象？ +
以后餐厅会不会区分成 +
吸烟和非吸烟区 单身和非单身区？ +
老牌子，麻烦你 +
我脑中浮现一个可怕的想法 或许是我在假装 +
我假装单身是一件快乐的事 +
对，那就是我 +
卖香烟的小贩 竟对我投射同情的目光 +
那真是最后一击 +
我不要让一本杂志 或我的朋友们 +
阻止我做自己 我是单身贵族，惊叹号 +
-你说什么？ -蔓越莓口味的伏特加 +
我才四天没来就有新饮料了？ +
我邀请史丹佛参加下城一个 +
向知名摄影师艾伦朗恩文 致敬的派对 +
不幸的是 他也邀请了他的新男友 +
-你好，我恨你 -玩得愉快，我也很恨我自己 +
封面的事我很抱歉 这与我无关 +
下个礼拜会有新的封面人物 我便成了历史 +
你真棒，失陪了 +
你得甩了他 +
不行，我们夏天要一起 分租房子 +
当我们在下城狂欢时… +
莎曼珊在她最爱的浪漫餐厅 等待威廉 +
-一个人吗？ -不，我在等人 +
她以为她记错时间 但当他迟迟没出现 +
她打到他的答录机，没有留言 +
不知道他被什么事耽搁了 +
你能叫侍者送一杯红酒来吗？ +
她没料到会在公共场合落单 +
手边没有一本书 或她单独外出用餐的盔甲 +
她无计可施 只好继续坐着等他 +
她知道威廉不会来了 +
为了得到现在想要的东西 他编织美好的未来 +
-还要水吗？ -不用了 +
她觉得暴露而脆弱，像个傻瓜 +
大家都在看，我觉得好丢脸 +
洗手间在哪里？ +
-你还好吗？ -谢谢，你真体贴 +
平常我不是这样子的 +
我不敢相信我竟会被 一个男人的花言巧语迷惑 +
有时女人就是想听听“我们” +
莎曼珊让那个侍者亲吻她 +
他处理面包时非常温柔且用心 +
带我回家，你便不寂寞 +
莎曼珊注视他充满希望的眼神 她体会到一件事 +
即使很难受 有时孤单比伪装好 +
我从刚认识的男人口中 听到这辈子最好笑的事 +
对不起，你的裤子… +
没关系 +
去你的，惊叹号 +
该回家了，你喝够了 +
-还早 -已经凌晨两点了 +
你走吧，回家去吧，史丹佛 带你疲惫、漂亮的屁股回家 +
-我想认识帅哥 -这里每个人都是同性恋 +
我可不这么认为 +
需要火吗？ +
杰克是当晚最符合我需求的人 +
单身、异性恋、会抽烟 +
上城没这么多烟 +
怎么样？好多了吗？ 现在如何？ +
米兰达对眼科医生的个别指导 +
使做爱成了视力检查 +
也许我们该尝试让它发生 +
我希望能做对，这样如何？ +
即使他有心学习 米兰达仍感觉不出差别 +
她不是喷射引擎 她的身体复杂多了 +
永远不会成功的 +
我快到了…你呢？ +
她想奖励他如此努力 +
于是米兰达也到达高潮了 +
这是她最后一次演出的告别秀 +
我是男子汉 +
-想不想坐我的跑车去兜风？ -太好了 +
我得去买烟，你需要什么吗？ +
我很快就回来 +
我看着镜中的自己 我到底在怕什么？ +
我仍然年轻有魅力 我绝不会孤独终老 +
-这是你吗？ -又来了 +
那问号在我面前瞪着我 +
那是我吗？ 我意识到若我跟他回家 +
那将是我唯一一次为了证明 自己的价值而和男人上床 +
那问号便会成为事实 +
-我要走了 -不行，我不让你下车 +
好 +
我想我应该去盐湖城试试看 +
-真的吗？ -夏绿蒂正在伪装 +
虽然她对伪装高潮没有异议 +
她却无法伪装亲密关系 +
我还是热爱演戏 我不打算放弃 +
汤姆也在伪装 他对纽约感到厌烦 +
-需要一个藉口离开 -我会想你的 +
我也是 +
这是个双重伪装的绝佳时机 +
在其他情况下 他们原本可以携手共度人生 +
一切回归正常 +
米兰达，我是乔许 打电话给我 +
米兰达忘记回乔许电话 +
莎曼珊向威廉讨回了公道 +
夏绿蒂发现不必为了修东西 +
而和男人有感情瓜葛 你可以付钱请工人来做 +
在我被回收之后 +
我决定不再逃避孤独生活 +
反而要怀抱那份恐惧去吃午餐 +
-在等人吗？ -没有 +
我就坐在那里 独自喝着一杯酒 +
没有书、没有男人、没有朋友 +
没有盔甲、没有伪装 +
