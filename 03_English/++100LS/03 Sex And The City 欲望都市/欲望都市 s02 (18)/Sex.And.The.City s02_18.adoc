Life is all about making choices. +
Some choices, like who you marry, are big. +
While others... are even bigger. +
Hey, what do you think? +
The five dollar ones that last three days +
or the ten dollar ones that last five days? +
Either one. +
Three days. +
Five dollars. +
Another choice is how to deal with an ex-boyfriend. +
Some women handle it coolly, calmly, while others... +
Fuck! +
Steve. +
-Go, go! -Oh, hey! Five dollar. +
You pay! Come back here! +
He just looked so hurt +
like a kid in one of those big-eyed velvet paintings. +
-Oh, poor Steve. -Well, I'm sorry, I panicked. +
What was I gonna do, stand around and chitchat about the weather? +
The man has been inside me, for God's sakes. +
-Could I get some more Sweet 'N Low? Yeah, sure. +
I have never been able to be friends +
with an ex-boyfriend. +
I meet those couples who stay friends +
and I think how? How do they do that? +
I've never been able to be friends with any man. Why would I? +
Women are for friendships, men are for fucking. +
Honey, you have got to learn to form an opinion. +
Friendship is the bonus of a relationship. +
If they don't want the relationship, +
they don't get me as a friend. +
So, what, if you don't make it as a couple, +
you withhold your friendship as punishment? +
Well, you make it sound so bad. +
Black widow spiders bite the heads off of their mates +
when they're through with them. +
I think withholding friendship is letting them off easy. +
Hey, can you imagine, you guys? Instead of the whole awful breaking up scene, +
you're just like, "Hey, you, come here." +
And you're just, argghhh! +
And chomp their head off. +
-Believe me, +
I would love to be one of those people who's all, +
"We loved, thank you, you enriched my life, +
now, go, prosper." +
But I'm much more, +
"We didn't work out, you need to not exist." +
What? +
It's just... it's just so childish. +
Not you, the whole situation. +
I mean... we keep dresses we'll never wear again, +
and we throw away our ex-boyfriends. +
I'm not, I'm not saying that I'm any better. +
I mean, I'm not, you know, I haven't been able to be friends with Big, but... +
if you love someone and you break up, +
where does the love go? +
To their next girlfriend. +
Oh, no, no, no, no. +
That is a different love. +
There is no way that the love that I had with Big +
is the same thing that he has with Natasha. +
Natasha? +
When'd you stop calling her +
the idiot stick figure with no soul? +
About three weeks ago when I saw them at Café M. +
He was holding her hand and smiling and... +
I finally got it. +
They're happy... slash... we're over. +
And it was okay. +
Natasha, what a bullshit name. +
-Totally. -Stupid. +
Yeah, it's complete bullshit. +
Later that night, I got to thinking about the ex-factor. +
In mathematics, we learned that "X" stands for the unknown. +
"A" plus "B" equals "X." +
But what's really unknown is... +
what plus what equals friendship with an ex? +
Is this an unsolvable equation? +
Or is it possible to transform a once passionate love +
into something that fits nice and easily +
onto the friendship shelf? +
I couldn't help but wonder... +
Can you be friends with an ex? +
That Sunday afternoon, Miranda was sitting at home +
enjoying a Biscotti and the paper when... +
There it was... +
her ex's head. +
I hear you breathing. +
Yeah. Uh, hi. +
That was a shitty, shitty thing you did +
running away from me on the street. +
I didn't run. +
You ran. +
Well, I wasn't expecting to see you and I'm-- I-- +
It really hurt my feelings. +
Well, I don't do very well with ex-boyfriends, +
and... +
Miranda, this is me. +
Steve. +
Yeah. +
I held your head while you were sleeping. +
I'm sorry. +
-I'm so sorry. -It's okay, it's okay. +
I just, I hadn't seen you in so long +
and I missed you, +
and then I did that shitty thing. +
-It wasn't that shitty, really. -It was. +
It was a shitty thing. +
I'm a shitty person. +
You are not a shitty person. +
I am! I am shitty. +
You would never do anything that shitty. +
What do you call showing up at your apartment +
in the middle of the afternoon and calling you shitty? +
Yeah, that was pretty shitty. +
You, you got a "bat in the cave." +
I miss you. +
Whenever something funny happens, +
I always wanna tell you about it. +
So tell me. +
Just 'cause we didn't make it as a couple +
doesn't mean we can't have a friendly meal +
once in a while, does it? +
I guess not. +
So what are you doing Friday? +
I have a date. +
Looking forward to it, are you? +
As Miranda made plans to have dinner with her last love... +
Charlotte came face to face with the memory of her first... +
her horse, Taddy. +
Charlotte's relationship with Taddy ended sadly +
when he threw her during a teen equestrian competition, +
causing her to break her collarbone +
and lose the blue ribbon. +
Her father promptly sold Taddy to another family +
and she hadn't been on a horse since. +
Charlotte wondered if maybe it was time +
to get back in the saddle again. +
Meanwhile, across town, +
Samantha was about to see a stallion of her own. +
Hi. +
I gotta tell you, you look amazing. +
Excuse me, but do I know you? +
No, not yet. +
But I was thinking that maybe +
you'd like to have dinner with me sometime. +
And what makes you think I'd like that? +
From the way you were just checking me out. +
Well, you get ten points for directness. +
Do I also get your phone number? +
I'm not sure yet. +
I tell you what. +
Here's my business card. +
You call me. +
Blatantly picking a woman up on the street. +
How'd you get to be so cocky? +
I was just born that way, I guess. +
At least consider meeting me for a friendly little drink. +
I'll think about it, Mr. Cocky. +
Please do. +
It was later that week when I spotted +
a Laura Ashley dress circa 1988 +
still hanging in my closet, that I decided +
it was time to give my ex a friendly phone call. +
-Hello? +
I hadn't planned on the idiot stick figure +
with no soul answering. +
Then I remembered... Big had caller ID. +
Shit! +
-Hello? -Well, hello yourself. +
Hey, hello. +
Did you just call? +
No, well, uh, yes, +
but I-- I didn't, I didn't get to talk because, uh, +
I, uh, I hit the, accidentally I hit the, the thing, thing, so, you know, it, it hung up, +
uh, well, so, yes. +
And I, um... +
I, uh, I heard, um, Natasha, so apologize to her. +
So how is Natasha? +
Uh... +
great, um... +
she's great. +
How are you? +
I am a-okay. +
You sound a little nuts. +
Come on, can't you let one go by? +
This is weird, +
the first call. +
Right. +
Maybe I'd, I'd, I'd do better +
if I went with my little prepared speech. +
Oh, you have a speech, do you? +
Okay. +
I was wondering what you thought of +
instead of pretending each other doesn't exist... +
we try to be friends or something. +
Well, I'd like that. +
I've been meaning to call you, +
but I didn't know if you wanted to hear from me, so I... +
Do you want to have a lunch or something? +
Let's have a lunch. +
Thank you. +
Hi. -Hi. +
I have a 1:00 reservation. Bradshaw. +
I used to make our lunch reservations in Big's name. +
But today, I put it in mine. +
Because that's what friends do. +
Yes, the other party is already here. +
Thank you. +
Hey. +
-Hey. -Hi. +
Are you hungry? 'Cause I'm hungry. +
I got up at 6:00, worked out, +
hardly had any breakfast. +
They have a great Cobb salad here. +
So, what do you say, shall we eat? +
-Let's eat. -We'll eat. +
And that's when I realized it... +
Big was nervous. +
It was odd. +
The new friend part of me +
felt incredibly compassionate, +
while the old girlfriend part of me felt incredibly smug. +
Oh! You okay? +
Yeah, fine. +
-Thank you. -Mm-hmm. +
Thank you. +
Well, you look good. +
Thank you, so do you. +
-Good afternoon. -Yeah. Thank you. +
The Cobb salad is very good here. +
Can I get you something to drink? +
Um, iced tea. +
Uh, a mineral water. +
-Scotch. -Cosmopolitan. +
An hour later, I had solved the unsolvable friendship equation. +
 +
Cosmopolitans plus scotch equals friendship with an ex. +
-God! +
And what about your music? +
If I had to listen to freakin' "Blood, Sweat, and Tears" one more time. +
Hey, "Blood, Sweat, and Tears" is great stuff. +
Ten minutes after we're awake? +
Okay. +
Tell me about the girl. +
-Really? -Yeah! +
Friends talk about their relationships, +
so, uh, go ahead, friend, tell me about the girl. +
Well... +
uh, um, she's, she's very sweet-- +
Okay, enough! +
Don't tell me about the girl. +
No can do. +
Uh, maybe we should make a pact. +
We don't talk about our relationships +
until they get really serious or something. +
Okay? +
Carrie... +
it is serious. +
We're engaged. +
I wanted you to hear it from me. +
Ow. +
I just got a splitting headache. +
Well... I-- I didn't know how to tell you, and... +
-and when you called for lunch-- -Engaged? +
How can you be engaged? +
You have a problem with commitment, remember? +
In fact, you told me you never wanted to get married again, +
ever. +
Well, things change. +
Meaning what? You just didn't want to marry me? +
-Look, Natasha and I-- -Don't say her name to me! +
Don't you dare say her name to me! +
You string me along for two years +
and then you marry some 25-year-old girl +
after only five months? +
-I did not string you along. -Okay, yeah, right. +
Fine, that's right, you didn't string me along. +
You know what, I have to go. I have a headache. +
-You okay? -Yeah, I'm fine. +
Here-- -Don't help me! +
Don't you help me! +
Carrie, hold on, wait. +
-Wait, wait. -What? What, what is it? +
Don't end it like this-- +
No, you're the one that ended it like this. +
I was trying to be friendly. So you know what? +
This seems like a, a much better way to end things. +
So go, go. +
Be engaged, get married to, um, +
uh, Najinski, or whatever her name is. +
Have a nice life. +
Don't worry about me, I'm fine. +
-Ooh! -Oh! +
These steps are very dangerous. +
-Oh! +
The next day, I had promised to hold Charlotte's hand +
while she attempted to go riding. +
Turned out she needed to hold mine as well. +
How you doing? +
Aside from the fact that my ex is engaged to a teenager +
and I've got horse shit on my $300 goddamn shoes, +
I'm doing okay. +
Well, I think you're amazing. +
I-- I would be in a hospital or something. +
-What the fuck is his problem? +
Oh, he, he's just got a stubborn streak. +
I mean, some horses, they, they never really like to be ridden. +
Taddy was like that when I first got him, +
but then once I broke him in... +
then he loved it. +
You know what? +
I broke in Big. +
I did. I broke him in. +
And now, the idiot stick figure +
with no soul gets to ride him. +
Carrie, I'm... +
I'm really sorry. +
I know you are, sweetie. +
Thanks. +
Oh, damn! Damn! +
You see, this is what happens. +
You try to be friendly with an ex +
and you wind up knee deep in shit! +
Perfect. +
Here you go, this is Pal. He's a good boy. +
Oh, and he's brown. +
Taddy was brown, but, +
but he had white spots on his flank. +
Just stay till I'm on the horse, +
then you can go, okay? +
Yeah, I'm here, it's all lovely. +
Go have fun. +
Hey, Pal. +
Here you go, foot in and up you go. +
As Charlotte placed her boot in the stirrup... +
all her bad memories of Taddy and broken bones +
and lost ribbons flooded over her. +
No! +
Can't. +
No, I can't. +
-Let's go. -You just paid. +
I said I can't! +
Hey, he's all saddled up. -I'm sorry. +
After a few "get to know each other phone calls," +
Samantha took up Mr. Cocky on his offer of a friendly drink. +
Turns out it was a very friendly drink. +
-Baby. -Oh! +
I want you to know that I never pick up guys on the street, +
unless they're very cute. +
So, get over here, you cutie, you. +
You know, before we go any further, +
I got-- I gotta warn you about somethin'. +
Warn me about what? +
I'm very well endowed. +
Ding, ding, ding. Jackpot. +
No, no, no, no. I'm serious. It's... +
It's huge. +
I mean... +
most women, they just can't handle it. +
Well, um, I'm not most women. +
So, unzip, and get over here. +
Samantha suddenly understood what made Mr. Cocky so cocky. +
I'm telling you, Carrie, +
it was like a wall of flesh coming at me. +
There is nothing scarier than a really big one coming at you. +
I didn't even want to get my mouth near it. +
I was afraid I'd get lockjaw. +
I mean, it was quite a shock. +
His hands are relatively tiny. +
Oh, don't tell me you believe that. +
Well, not anymore. +
I am really gonna have to psych myself up +
before I try it again. +
You're gonna try it again? Why? +
Because it's there. +
Sweetie, it's a penis, not Mount Everest. +
Well, let me tell you, if it was Mount Everest, +
last night I could only make it to Base Camp One. +
Wowsa! +
You dated Mr. Big, +
I'm dating Mr. Too Big. +
You know what, you're unbelievable. +
You, you broke up with James because he was too small, +
this guy's too big. +
Who are you, Goldicocks? +
Yep. +
I'm looking for one that's just right. +
That night, after a friendly dinner, +
Steve and Miranda began to explore +
their newfound friendship. +
You know, if you were a real friend, you'd let me keep it. +
Yeah, sorry, that's one of the conditions of a break-up. +
You gotta give me back my fire department t-shirt. +
It fits me perfectly. +
Boo-hoo, tell it to the judge. +
Please? +
Nope. +
So thanks for coming out for dinner. +
Well, thanks for letting me pay, finally. +
Hey, that's what friends do, isn't it? +
Well, goodnight. +
Right, that's what friends do, isn't it? +
Hey, I got another question for you. +
Do friends kiss... +
here? +
No. +
Oh. +
Do friends kiss here? +
No. +
Oh. +
Do friends kiss... +
Yeah. +
So we had good reasons for breaking up, right? +
Yeah. +
Money, schedules, goals. +
Good reasons. +
So what now? +
Are we still just friends? +
Yeah, we're still just friends. +
Friends who have sex. +
Oh. +
And in a bed across town... +
You ready? +
Wait. +
After two advanced yoga classes +
and a hit of the best Hawaiian Gold she could find, +
Samantha was ready to take another run at Mount Everest. +
Okay, here we go. +
Nice and easy. +
Okay. +
That's it. +
-Mm-hmm. +
Easy-- ah, ah! +
-Easy. +
Okay. +
Oh. -Oh, good. +
Okay, here we go. +
-Here we go? -Yeah. +
You mean, we're not there yet? +
-No. -Okay, stop. +
Whoa, boy. +
Whoa, whoa. +
Can we just be friends? +
And just like that, +
Samantha made her very first male friend. +
The next day in Central Park, +
Charlotte was making a new friend as well. +
Whoa, whoa. +
Good, Pal. +
She had decided she and Pal +
were moving too fast. +
Before they could go any further, +
they needed to slow down and get to know each other better. +
Aw, you're a good boy, Pal. +
Does that feel good? +
Do you like that? +
Oh, my Taddy liked that, too. +
Yes, I love my Taddy so much. +
Oh, good boy. +
And with that gentle nudge from her new pal... +
all Charlotte's bad feelings about Taddy lifted +
and she remembered just how much +
she had loved his cute white spots. +
Easy, easy. +
Okay. Go, boy, go! +
Woo-hoo! +
Hey, it's Carrie... I'm shoe shopping. +
It's me... are you there? +
Pick up if you're there. +
You're not there. +
Okay. +
Well, I'm calling to say I feel bad about last week. +
I... +
I didn't mean for it to happen like that. I... +
I thought you needed to know. +
I hated the idea of someone else telling you. +
Christ, I feel like a real shit. +
I'm sorry. +
I'm, I'm really sorry... +
I would, you know, I would never, ever hurt you deliberately-- +
I know you wouldn't. +
You're there? +
Yeah, I'm here. +
So... like I was saying... +
I'm sorry. +
No, I'm sorry, too. +
I shouldn't have reacted like that. +
I just... +
It was just such a shock. +
I guess it was a shock I needed to hear to move on or something. +
Yeah. +
I wish you all the best. +
I do. +
I hope you and Natasha will be very happy. +
Do you mean that? +
No, +
but I will. +
Really, really. +
I hope someday very soon we can all meet for a drink +
and be great friends. +
You know, like they do in the movies. +
So... +
Bye. +
And I actually managed to hold on to those friendly feelings, until... +
I can't believe my ex-boyfriend is six blocks away +
at the Plaza right now having an engagement brunch. +
I can't believe he had the nerve to invite you. +
Oh, no, no, no, it's, it's my own fault. +
I had to make the big, "let's be friends" speech. +
But who am I kidding? +
Big and I were never friends, +
we were something else. +
Something that apparently did not end with +
an engagement party at the Plaza. +
-Do we want another round? -What do you think? +
-Four more, please. -Coming right up. +
You know, I think I can actually +
"feel" them over there eating shrimp. +
It's just... +
why her? +
I mean, really... +
Why her? +
One word. +
Hubble. +
Oh, my God. +
Hubble! +
It is! It is so Hubble. +
-Who's Hubble? -Hubble! +
Robert "Hubble" Redford in The Way We Were . +
Oh, I love that movie. +
No, I love, love, love, that movie. +
Never saw it. +
Oh, my God! -What are you, an alien? +
How could you not have seen The Way We Were ? +
Chick film. +
Okay, Robert Redford is madly in love with Barbra Streisand... +
"Katie." +
K-K-K-Katie! +
Oh, K-K-K-Katie, right. +
Yeah, but he can't be with her +
because she's too complicated, +
and she has wild, curly hair. +
Hello? C-c-c-curly. +
Yeah. So he leaves her +
and marries this simple girl with straight hair. +
Ladies, +
The world is made up +
The simple girls and the Katie girls. +
I'm a Katie girl. And where are our drinks? +
I always, always, always cry at the last scene of that movie, +
when she sees him in front of the hotel with his new wife. +
The simple girl. +
And she reaches up and-- +
And smooths his hair away. +
And she says to him, +
"Your girl is lovely, Hubble." +
And then, the music comes in. +

I miss James. +
Excuse me? +
After I left my friends, I found myself pulled +
to the site of the big engagement party. +
I had no intention of going in, but it was on my way home. +
Uh, one second. +
I had a choice. +
I could run, or I could stand and ask him the question +
that if I didn't ask, +
would haunt me the rest of my life. +
I thought by the time I got here, +
I'd know what to say. +
And? +
Well... +
you're late. +
The party's over. +
I'll say it is. +
Funny. +
Anyway, I was just on my way home and-- +
Hey. +
I have a question for you. +
Why wasn't it me? +
-Carrie-- -No, seriously. +
I really need to hear you say it. +
Come on, be a friend. +
I don't know. +
It just got so hard... +
And she's... +
Yeah. +
Your girl is lovely, Hubble. +
I don't get it. +
And you never did. +
Easy girl, easy. +
Eas-- +
Then I had a thought, maybe I didn't break Big. +
Maybe the problem was he couldn't break me. +
Maybe some women aren't meant to be tamed. +
Maybe they need to run free until they find someone +
just as wild to run with. +
欲望城市 +
（性爱专家凯莉布雷萧） +
，这时我终于明白 +
人生总是不停在做选择 +
有些选择很重大 好比说跟谁结婚 +
但有些则更加重大 +
买五块钱维持三天的 还是十块钱维持五天的？ +
-都好 -买三天的 +
五块钱 +
另一个选择是如何面对前男友 +
有些女人很冷静，而有些则… +
妈的，是史蒂夫 +
快走… +
赔我五块钱，回来 +
他看起来很受伤 像那些画中的孩子 +
-可怜的史蒂夫 -对不起，我一时慌了 +
我不想跟他聊天气之类的话题 我跟那男人上过床 +
-再给我一包低糖好吗？ -我没办法跟旧情人做朋友 +
我碰到和前男友维持友谊的人 就会想“她们怎么做到的？” +
我从来不跟男人做朋友 +
要友谊找女人就好 男人是用来上床的 +
-你得学着有自己的主张 -友谊是额外的好处 +
如果他们不想谈感情 那就做不成朋友了 +
-你收回友谊作为惩罚？ -你干嘛讲那么难听 +
黑寡妇蜘蛛办完事后 便把伴侣的头咬下来 +
收回友谊可以让他们自在离开 +
免了分手那幕，你说“过来” 然后大口把他们的头咬下来 +
我很欣赏那种 +
“我们相爱过，谢谢你丰富 我的生命，现在各奔前程吧” +
但我比较像是 “我们合不来，你最好消失” +
-怎么了？ -真的好幼稚 +
不是说你，是整个情况 +
我们留着再也不穿的衣服 +
却把前男友像垃圾一样扔掉 +
我不是说我自己处理得多好 +
我还无法跟大人物做朋友 +
但若你爱过一个人然后分手了 那份爱到哪儿去了？ +
-移情到下一个女友身上 -不…那是不一样的爱 +
我跟大人物之间的感情 +
绝对和他与娜塔莎之间不同 +
你什么时候开始不再叫她 “缺少灵魂的空洞白痴”？ +
大约三周前我在餐厅见到他们 +
他握着她的手微笑 +
我终于明白了 他们很快乐，我们结束了 +
而我觉得没关系 +
-娜塔莎？什么烂名字 -一点也没错 +
-愚蠢 -烂到极点 +
当晚，我思考着“X”因子 +
在数学中，X代表未知数 +
A加B等于X +
但未知的是什么加什么 会等于和前男友的友谊？ +
这是个无解的方程式吗？ +
或者有没有可能 将昔日热烈的感情 +
转化成一份恰好的友谊？ +
我不禁纳闷 和旧情人可以做朋友吗？ +
星期天下午当米兰达坐在家中 +
享受着饼干和报纸… +
她前男友就站在外面 +
我听见你的呼吸声 +
嗨 +
你从我面前跑开真是恶劣 +
-我没有跑 -你有 +
-我没想到会看见你，而且… -那真的伤了我的心 +
我不知道该怎么和前男友相处 +
米兰达，是我…史蒂夫 +
你入睡时是我抱着你的头 +
对不起，我很抱歉 +
没关系… +
我们好久没见面，我很想你 +
但我却做了这么恶劣的事 +
-没那么恶劣，真的 -有，我是个恶劣的人 +
-你不是个恶劣的人 -我很恶劣 +
你绝不会做出这么恶劣的事 +
那我跑来你家骂你恶劣 又怎么说？ +
-没错，那挺恶劣的 -你鼻涕快流出来了 +
我很想你 +
每当有好笑的事发生 我总是想告诉你 +
那就告诉我，我们当不成情人 +
不表示不能像朋友 偶尔一起吃个饭，对吧？ +
-是 -你星期五要做什么？ +
-我有约会了 -你很期待吧？ +
正当米兰达计划和前男友 一起吃晚餐 +
夏绿蒂面对记忆中的初恋… +
她的爱马，泰迪 +
夏绿蒂和泰迪的关系 悲伤地结束 +
它在一场比赛中将她摔下马 +
害她摔断锁骨，并且输掉冠军 +
她父亲把泰迪卖给别人 +
从那时起她再也没骑过马 +
夏绿蒂考虑 是否到了该重回马鞍的时候 +
同时，在城的另一头 +
莎曼珊即将棋逢对手 +
我非告诉你不可，你好漂亮 +
-不好意思，我们认识吗？ -还没有 +
但改天或许你愿意 跟我共进晚餐？ +
-你凭什么认为我会答应？ -从你注视我的眼神 +
你的率直可以得十分 +
-我也得到你的电话了吗？ -我还不确定 +
这样吧 +
这是我的名片，你跟我联络 +
公然在大街上和女人搭讪 +
-你怎么会这么自大？ -我想是天生的吧 +
至少考虑出来跟我喝一杯 交个朋友 +
我会的，自大先生 +
请尽管这么做 +
当我发现衣柜里还挂着一件 大约1988年的旧洋装时 +
我决定是时候打电话给前男友 伸出友谊之手 +
我没料到会是那个缺少灵魂的 空洞白痴接的电话 +
接着我想起 大人物家有来电显示 +
该死 +
-你好 -刚才是你打的吗？ +
不…对，但我还没来得及讲话 +
因为…我不小心撞到…东西 +
所以挂断了，没错，是我打的 +
我听到娜塔莎的声音 替我向她道个歉 +
娜塔莎好吗？ +
她很好 +
-你好吗 -我一切顺利 +
-你的语气听起来傻呼呼的 -拜托，你不能放过我一次吗 +
-这很怪，分手后第一次联络 -没错 +
也许我照着准备的讲稿念 会好一点 +
你有讲稿？ +
我在想… +
不知道你觉得… +
别再假装彼此不存在 +
我们试着做朋友如何？ +
我很乐意 +
我本来要打给你 但我不知道你想不想接我电话 +
-你愿意一起吃午餐吗？ -我们一起吃午餐吧 +
我订了一点的位子，布雷萧 +
以前我习惯报大人物的名字 +
但今天我用自己的名字订位 这是朋友的做法 +
另一位已经到了 +
你饿了吗？我很饿 +
我六点就起床，几乎没吃早餐 +
这里的玉米沙拉很棒 +
-你说呢？可以吃饭了吗？ -我们吃饭吧 +
我那时发现到：大人物很紧张 +
奇怪的是，身为新朋友 这部分的我觉得非常同情 +
但过去当女朋友那部分的我 却觉得沾沾自喜 +
-你还好吧？ -没事 +
-你看起来气色很好 -谢谢，你也是 +
午安 +
-这儿的玉米沙拉很好吃 -请问需要什么饮料？ +
-冰茶 -矿泉水 +
-威士忌 -柯梦波丹 +
一小时后 我已解开了无解的友谊方程式 +
答案似乎是… +
柯梦波丹加上威士忌 等于和前男友的友谊 +
-老天 -还有你的音乐 +
我终于不必再听 “血汗泪合唱团”了 +
-他们的音乐很棒 -起床后十分钟听那种东西？ +
好了…跟我说说你女朋友的事 +
-真的？ -朋友之间会谈论感情生活 +
说吧，朋友 谈谈你女朋友的事 +
她很温柔… +
够了，别跟我说她的事 我听不下去 +
我们订个协议吧 +
除非是很认真的感情 否则我们不跟对方说 +
凯莉… +
这次是认真的 +
我们订婚了 +
我希望由我亲口告诉你 +
-我现在头痛欲裂 -我不知道该怎么告诉你 +
-当你打来时… -订婚？ +
你怎么可能订婚？ 你这个人恐惧承诺，记得吗？ +
事实上 你跟我说你再也不想结婚了 +
-事情会改变 -你只是不想娶我？ +
-听着，娜塔莎和我… -别在我面前提她的名字 +
你玩弄了我两年 +
然后才过五个月 你就要娶一个25岁的女人 +
-我没有玩弄你 -随便，好，你没有 +
我要走了，我头很痛 +
-你没事吧？ -我很好 +
别碰我，不要你帮忙 +
-凯莉，等一下，别走 -你还想干嘛？ +
-别这样离去 -是你造成的 +
我想保持友谊 但这种结束方式似乎好得多 +
去吧，尽管订婚，跟那个叫… +
娜金斯基还是什么的女人结婚 不用管我，我好得很 +
这些阶梯很危险 +
隔天，我答应夏绿蒂 在她尝试骑马时要陪着她 +
-我也需要她的支持 -你还好吗？ +
除了我前男友 跟一个年轻小妞订婚 +
而我价值三百块的鞋子 沾到马粪？ +
我很好 +
我觉得你很坚强 换做是我可能已进了医院 +
-它到底有什么毛病？ -它只是性情倔强 +
有些马不喜欢被骑 +
泰迪一开始也是这样 但它一旦被我驯服就很温驯 +
你知道吗？我驯服了大人物 +
现在那缺少灵魂的空洞白痴 却坐享其成 +
凯莉，我真的很难过 +
我知道，亲爱的，谢了 +
该死，现实就是如此 +
你试着跟前男友做朋友 最后却弄得自己一身屎 +
太好了 +
这是派尔，它很乖 +
它是棕色的，泰迪也是 但它腹部有白色的斑点 +
等我上马之后你就可以走了 好吗？ +
我会等你，在这里很愉快 去玩吧 +
-派尔 -脚踩着马蹬然后上去 +
当夏绿蒂把脚套进马蹬时 所有关于泰迪 +
摔断骨头以及痛失冠军的 可怕记忆全涌上心头 +
不行 +
我做不到 +
不，我没办法，我们走吧 +
-我说我没办法 -它已经套上马鞍了 +
几通电话之后 +
莎曼珊答应自大先生的邀约 出去喝一杯 +
到最后已经超越朋友的界线 +
我从来不在街上钓凯子 除非他们非常迷人 +
过来吧，你这迷人的家伙 +
在我们更进一步之前 我得警告你一件事 +
什么事？ +
-我本钱很雄厚 -中头奖了 +
我是说真的 +
它很大 +
大多数的女人无法接受 +
我不是大多数的女人 拉下拉练…过来吧 +
莎曼珊突然明白 为什么自大先生会如此骄傲了 +
那仿佛整面肉墙向我直扑而来 +
没什么比一根大棒子 冲向你更可怕 +
我的嘴巴根本不想靠近它 我怕会肌肉痉挛 +
我真的很吃惊，他的手算小的 +
-别告诉我你信那一套？ -现在不信了 +
再试一次前我得为自己打打气 +
-你还要再试一次？为什么？ -因为它就在那里 +
-只是命根子不是埃佛勒斯峰 -如果它是埃佛勒斯峰 +
昨晚我才刚登上基地营呢 +
之前你和大人物交往 现在我和“超大人物”约会 +
真是难以置信 你因詹姆斯尺寸太小和他分手 +
现在这个又太大 你是谁？性爱女神吗？ +
我理想中的对象要刚刚好 +
当晚，一顿友好的晚餐后 +
史蒂夫和米兰达 开始探索他们的新友谊 +
如果你真的是朋友 你会让我留着它 +
你得把我消防队的T恤还给我 +
-我穿非常合身 -去跟法官说吧 +
-拜托？ -不行 +
-谢谢你答应出来吃晚餐 -谢谢你…终于肯让我付钱 +
朋友是这样的，不是吗？ +
晚安 +
对，朋友是这样的，不是吗？ +
我还有一个问题要问你 +
朋友会亲… +
这里吗？ +
不会 +
朋友会亲这里吗？ +
不会 +
那朋友会亲… +
会 +
我们分手有很好的理由对吧？ +
没错，金钱、未来计划、目标 +
好理由 +
那现在呢？ +
-我们仍只是朋友吗？ -对，我们仍只是朋友 +
会上床的朋友 +
在这城市的另一头… +
-准备好了吗？ -等等 +
等等 +
上完两堂进阶瑜珈课 +
以及抽了她所能找到最棒的烟 +
莎曼珊准备好 再次挑战埃佛勒斯峰 +
来吧 +
慢慢来 +
就是这样 +
慢慢来… +
轻一点 +
很好 +
太棒了 +
要开始了 +
要开始了？ 你是说你还没进去？ +
-还没 -停下来 +
老天 +
我们能不能只当朋友就好？ +
就这样，莎曼珊交了生平 第一个男性朋友 +
隔天在中央公园 夏绿蒂也在交朋友 +
她觉得她和派尔进展太快了 +
他们应该把步调放慢 多认识彼此 +
你很乖，派尔，那样舒服吗？ +
你喜欢吗？我的泰迪也很喜欢 +
我好爱我的泰迪，好马儿 +
她的新伙伴轻轻推了她一下 +
使夏绿蒂对泰迪的反感消失了 +
她回想起过去 她曾经多爱它漂亮的白色斑点 +
放轻松… +
走吧 +
-我是凯莉，我出门买鞋了 -是我，你在家吗？ +
如果你在家就接电话 +
你不在家 +
我打来是想说 上星期的事我觉得很抱歉 +
我不是有意造成那种局面 +
你必须知道这件事 而我不想让别人告诉你 +
老天，我觉得自己很混帐 对不起，我真的很抱歉 +
你知道我绝不会故意伤害你 +
我知道你不会 +
-原来你在家？ -对，我在家 +
-那…就像我说的，我很抱歉 -我也很抱歉 +
我不该有那么大反应 我只是… +
这消息让我很震惊 +
我想这是必要的打击 好让我继续往前走 +
是 +
我衷心祝福你，真的 +
我希望你和娜塔莎过得很幸福 +
-那是真心话吗？ -不是 +
但我会的，真的，我希望… +
将来有一天，很快… +
我们大家能一起出来喝东西 当好朋友 +
就像电影里演的那样 +
那么… +
再见了 +
再见 +
事实上，我真的打算 维持那份友好的感觉，直到… +
（我们订婚了） +
我不敢相信我的前男友 现在正在六条街外的饭店 +
举行订婚宴 +
我不敢相信他竟然有脸邀请你 +
那是我的错，是我自己 要对他发表“友好宣言” +
我在开什么玩笑？我们从来 都不是朋友，我们是其他关系 +
显然是那种最后不会在饭店 举行订婚派对的关系 +
还要再一轮饮料吗？ +
麻烦再来四杯 +
我想我可以感觉到 他们正在那边吃虾子 +
只是…为什么是她？ +
说真的，为什么是她？ +
-一句话：赫伯 -赫伯 +
我的天，赫伯 没错，真的好赫伯 +
-谁是赫伯？ -赫伯 +
劳勃瑞福在“往日情怀”中 饰演的赫伯 +
-我好爱那部电影 -我超…超爱那部电影 +
-没看过 -我的天 +
你怎么可能没看过 “往日情怀”？ +
少女看的片子 +
劳勃瑞福疯狂地爱着 芭芭拉史翠珊 +
-凯蒂 -凯…凯蒂 +
凯…凯蒂，没错 +
但他不能跟她在一起 因为她太复杂了 +
而且还有一头狂野的卷发 +
卷…卷发 +
所以他离开她 娶了一个直发的单纯女孩 +
我突然有所领悟 +
这世界只有两种类型的女人 +
单纯型和凯蒂型 +
我就是凯蒂型 饮料到底送来了没？ +
我每次看那部电影的 最后一幕都会哭 +
当她在旅馆前 看见他和他新婚妻子 +
那单纯女孩 +
-她抬起手… -拨开他的头发 +
对他说 “你太太很漂亮，赫伯” +
然后音乐进来了 +
-（回忆…） -我的天，真好听 +
（像是我遥远心境的一角） +
（往日情怀的…） +
（模糊记忆） +
我最爱的部分让我来 （是否…） +
（是否当时一切都太单纯？） +
（或者时光改写了每行诗？） +
（如果我们有机会重来） +
（告诉我，会有结果吗？） +
（可能吗？） +
我想念詹姆斯 +
你说什么？ +
和朋友们散会后，我发现自己 +
不由自主往订婚派对的 地点走去 +
我并不想进去 但那在我回家的路上 +
等我一会 +
我有个选择 我可以跑走，或问他一个… +
如果不问 会困扰我一辈子的问题 +
我以为在我到达之前 我就会知道该说什么 +
然后呢？ +
你迟到了，派对结束了 +
我想是吧 +
有意思 +
我只是回家时顺路经过 +
我有个问题要问你 为什么不是我？ +
不，我是认真的 我真的需要听你亲口说 +
拜托，我们是朋友 +
我不知道 +
就是很难 +
-而她… -是 +
你太太很漂亮，赫伯 +
-我不明白 -你永远也不会明白 +
别激动 +
那时我想到 也许我并未驯服大人物 +
也许问题在于他无法驯服我 +
也许有些女人注定不该被驾驭 +
也许她们需要自由奔驰 直到她们找到… +
性情相投的伴侣一起同行 +
