'''
I ran into my friend Skipper on the street the other day. +
He was bruised and frantic. +
He'd just broken up with another girl. +
I mean, I thought everything was going fine. +
That's when they tiptoe up and clobber you. +
Well, what did she say she thought was wrong? +
Skipper, you're a very sweet guy. +
I mean, this isn't about anything you did. +
It's just that we're in very different places right now. +
We want different things from life. +
I feel like I need to spend more time alone. +
So, actually, we want the same thing. +
We both want to spend more time with you. +
Three months before that +
it was a dental hygienist named Tiffany. +
The timing is wrong, that's all. +
You're one of the nicest guys I've ever known. +
It's just that I feel like +
I've reached a time in my life +
when I need to focus on my career. +
And I don't want to feel guilty about that. +
But I don't want you to give up your career. +
I know, I know. +
You've been great. +
You really deserve someone who will appreciate you. +
I just don't feel like I have anything to give at the moment. +
And last year, it was Miranda. +
I feel like I need to spend more time alone. +
I-- I've just reached a point in my life +
where I need to focus on my career. +
I just don't think that I have anything to give at the moment. +
Skipper, what else can I say? +
I have such horrible luck with women. +
I totally should've seen this coming. +
But, of course, I didn't. +
Because they wait for you +
to get relaxed, and get comfortable, +
before they bring the ice pick down right between your eyes. +
Not all women. +
Just the types of women +
you seem to be attracted to. +
Yeah, over, and over, and over again. +
Well, those ladies don't know what they're missing +
and missing, and missing. +
Skipper's pattern was clear to both of us... +
He was a sweet guy who was perpetually attracted to women +
who were looking for jerks. +
Later that night, on a date across town, +
Miranda was repeating a pattern of her own. +
She had been dating a lawyer she met +
when they got into a big fight in court. +
A frequent guest on MSNBC, +
Kevin was not just argumentative, +
he was an anger professional. +
You know, I think I gotta revise my opinion +
that you gotta be an idiot to want to go out to a movie these days. +
I mean, it was worth the 19 bucks, +
plus ten dollars in snacks and water +
just to hear that bus driver behind us +
explaining filmmaking to his wife. +
He certainly had some wonderful insights to share. +
But at least, on the bright side, +
it was an interesting movie, right? +
Yeah, right! It was a real Citizen Kane . +
Well, I thought the actor who played "Carlo" +
was kind of charming. +
That moron looks like he walked into work +
before the anesthesia wore off from his lobotomy. +
All right, all right, I'll just get us a cab, okay? +
Taxi! +
You gotta face uptown +
to get a cab around here. +
I've caught plenty of cabs this way. +
Yeah, in never-never land, +
where people constantly confuse +
a complete lack of talent with charm. +
Come on, Gene Shalit, get in the damn cab. +
Come on. +
Get in, sore loser. +
Come on, in. +
-In, come on. -Jesus! +
Miranda hated how he ordered her around +
and told her what do... +
Every place except one. +
Put your hands up over your head. +
Spread your legs. +
The weird thing is +
when he tells me what to do in life, it drives me crazy. +
But when he tells me what to do during sex, +
it really drives me crazy. +
It's totally hot! +
That looks like a good spot. +
Everybody, check for park poo. +
I mean, isn't that funny? +
That what I hate in life, I love in sex? +
So how about if you limit your contact with him to just sex? +
Oh, that's a nice, healthy relationship. +
The thing is, I'm not ready yet to throw in the towel. +
No, you're just ready to wrap it around his neck. +
He's going through a very stressful time, +
waiting to make partner at his firm. +
When that finally works out, +
I think maybe he'll lighten up a bit. +
Or maybe you should just face the fact +
that you're attracted to angry guys. +
Deviled eggs? +
Wait a second... hold the eggs! +
What about Skipper? He never got angry. +
Yeah, and you dumped him. Fits a pattern. +
I don't have a pattern. +
In math, randomness is considered a pattern. +
Yes, and I'm what they call a prime number. +
She's got a very obvious pattern, you know. +
I do? What? Tell me! +
You wait for a perfect guy to ask you on a perfect date... +
And when he does, you project this huge fantasy on him, +
setting up these enormous expectations... +
Which promptly blow up in your pretty little face. +
You put all your deviled eggs in one basket, so to speak. +
That's a horrible pattern. +
Well, spread it around a little more. +
Date a few guys at once +
and then you won't feel so disappointed. +
Are you asking Charlotte to juggle? +
It's all about multi-tasking. +
None of us can afford to fall into this +
"one man at a time" pattern. +
I mean, look at how much time you wasted with Big. +
Yeah, but Big was an aberration. +
Next time I meet a handsome, wealthy, +
and emotionally unavailable 43-year-old man, +
I'll know what to expect. +
Will you? +
Or will you just make +
the same mistake all over again? +
I wondered... +
were we all just victims of conditioned responses? +
Doomed to repeat the same unconscious relationship patterns? +
Were we all, in fact, +
just dating the same person over and over again? +
Well, I guess I have dated quite a few artists. +
But I don't think they were all the same person. +
Okay, yes, +
they were all narcissists with commitment phobias +
and substance abuse issues, +
but in my opinion, +
the painters were very different from the sculptors. +
Handsome waspy assholes who treat me like shit. +
I only date girls with Sony PlayStations. +
Or breasts. +
That night, Samantha became acquainted +
with the new neighbors next door. +
Though she had never met them face to face, +
she already knew them intimately. +
The idea that someone else was having great sex and flaunting it, +
was more than she could bear. +
So she decided, if you can't join 'em, +
beat it. +
It all fit Samantha's pattern to a "T"... +
having a wall between her and the person +
she was having sex with. +
After a few weeks of not seeing Big, +
I was beginning to fall into some familiar patterns of my own. +
Staying out till 3:00 and sleeping till noon, +
ordering take out from the same greasy Chinese, +
and calling old friends +
who would always be there for me when I was feeling... +
restless. +
McFadden. +
Hey, John, it's Carrie. +
Carrie, hey, yeah, how are you? Long time. +
Yeah, I know, I know. Listen, um... +
I thought if you weren't doing anything, +
you might want to meet for a drink after work. +
Yeah, sure, that would be great. +
Uh, how about um... sixish? +
I could probably be there about 6:30. +
Perfect, I'll see you then. +
That evening, at 6:30 sharp... +
Hey. +
Hey, wow, it's great to see you. +
You, too. -Wow. +
Come on in. I was just gonna, um, open up a bottle of red. +
Oh, red, yeah, beautiful. +
I just, uh... I gotta be somewhere by 8:30. +
Oh, that's okay, I've got dinner plans at 8:00. +
Oh, okay. +
Mmm. +
John was as dependable a pal as a gal could ever hope for. +
Fun, comfortable, and easy to be with. +
The kind of guy who you could shed all inhibitions +
and really be yourself around. +
No muss... no fuss. +
So, how's the uh... +
goin'? +
Great. +
-It's great. -Great. +
How's work with you? +
Never dull. Never dull. +
How's your uh, younger sister doing? +
Brother. +
The one that moved to, uh... Phoenix? +
Tallahassee. +
-Right. Right. +
So how- how's he doing down there? +
He's doing great, thanks for asking. +
-Sure. -Yeah. +
And then I realized it. +
I didn't have a relationship pattern, +
I had a between-relationship pattern. +
I always went back to John after every devastating, +
soul-shattering, gut-wrenching break up. +
He was sweet, handsome, uncomplicated... +
A real shot in the arm for my sexual self-esteem. +
Thanks for the call, gorgeous. +
Sure put a cherry on my sundae. +
Why had I been keeping him on the bench all these years? +
Did I really believe a relationship had to be difficult in order to work? +
Hey, do you want to have dinner Friday night? +
Dinner? +
Uh... yeah, sure. +
I should check my schedule, but I think I can make it. +
Great. +
You want to say, like uh... +
8:00? +
How about 8:15? +
And just like that, I broke my pattern. +
Carrie, you can't date your fuck buddy. +
Mm, say it a little louder. +
I don't think the old lady +
in the last row heard you. +
You're gonna take the only person in your life +
that's there purely for sex, no strings attached, +
and turn him into a human being? +
Why? +
Excuse me? "Fuck buddy"? +
What is a "fuck buddy"? +
-Oh, come on. +
A "fuck buddy" is a guy you probably dated once or twice, +
and it didn't really go anywhere, +
but the sex is so great, +
you sort of keep him on call. +
Oh, he's like "dial-a-dick." +
You-- you mean you just call this guy up +
when you're... you know, horny? +
-Mm-hmm. -Yes. +
And he just comes right over? +
Well, he's not a slave, sweetheart. +
He does have a life. +
But you don't really have to know about it. +
And you're generally guaranteed delivery within Manhattan +
in six hours or less. +
And you guys all have one? +
Well, mine moved to Chicago. +
But now we have phone sex. +
What's he doing in Chicago? +
I have absolutely no idea. +
A few moments later, emboldened by our conversation, +
and high from too many tantric headstands, +
Charlotte asked a man out for the first time. +
Man, that class was tough. +
I've never sweated so much in my entire life. +
Would you like to go out to dinner Friday night? +
Sure. +
I wondered... +
If Charlotte could break her pattern +
and start asking out every man in Manhattan, +
why couldn't I start having a deeper relationship +
with the man I have shallow sex with? +
Wow. +
You're all dressy. +
Yeah. +
Well, I guess... +
Thanks. +
The fact was, I wanted to tell him +
that he'd never actually seen me in clothes. +
Uh, so do you want a-- a glass of wine first, or do you just want-- +
No, I'm fine, thanks. +
Hey, wait, wait, wait. +
-Wait. -Oh. +
I made reservations. +
Huh? +
At a Sushi restaurant. +
Oh. Oh, cool, I see... +
No! I mean, God! +
I me-- I mean Sushi! +
Japa-- Japanese food. +
Oh, when you said dinner, you meant dinner. +
-Yeah. -Oh, no. +
It's just that, whenever we've had dinner, +
we've always, you know... +
Yeah, I know, I know. +
Oh. +
All right, I'm gonna-- Um, I'm just gonna get my purse. +
Like most first dates, we were off to an awkward start. +
Um, the yellowtail sashimi, +
two pieces of salmon sushi +
and a spicy tuna hand roll. +
Oh, do you like eel? +
Uh, no way. +
I-- I'll have the chicken teriyaki, well done, okay? +
No, the sushi's so amazing here. +
No, I just-- I can't deal with the raw stuff, +
you know, it just doesn't work. +
Well, why didn't you tell me? +
We could have gone someplace else. +
No, don't worry about it. +
If I'm hungry, I'll grab a burger after. +
Okay. +
Oh, hey, hey listen, before I forget, +
this is for you. +
Well. +
Thanks. What is it? +
Forty minutes free long distance, +
continental U.S., no strings attached. +
It's to promote our new 7-7-3 service. +
See, seven days, seven hours, +
three dollars a day. +
Oh, wow. Thank you. +
So, you like-- +
Think these gimmicks up? +
Sort of, I mean, officially, I sell time. +
But I get these incentive minutes +
which I can distribute at my own discretion. +
Oh. So if I'm lucky, +
I might get a whole hour next time? +
I don't think so. +
But if you're currently an MCI customer +
and you switch, +
then you get two hours for free. +
I was kidding. +
Oh, right, gotcha. +
-Right. +
So, maybe we should just, uh, order some sake? +
Oh, yeah, sure. Hey, sake to me! +
We went back to my place for a quickie. +
I needed to erase the stagnant memory of the past two hours. +
Was it really possible that someone so stimulating in bed +
could be so tedious in life? +
Ahh! +
Meanwhile, Samantha was actually beginning to look forward +
to the company of her new neighbors. +
Every night, like clockwork, +
right after the end of the 11:00 news... +
Samantha relished her role as the invisible guest vocalist +
to an unseen band. +
Until one night, she wasn't so invisible. +
Oh! +
That Saturday, Miranda planned for us all to meet +
her latest fling for brunch. +
Apparently, he had flung himself elsewhere. +
He should be here any minute, really. I-- +
Hey, don't worry about it, if it's just us, fine. +
It's not like we've got anywhere else to go. +
I do, I have a date tonight. +
With whom? +
That yoga guy. +
I asked him out. +
-Mmm! -Wow, I'm impressed. +
You know, once I broke the ice with him, +
it was just like riding a bike. +
I have so many dates this week, +
that I had to schedule two in one night. +
-You double-booked? -Well, I had to. +
This one guy was going out of town for three weeks, +
and the other guy, I didn't want to cancel. +
So how do you conceive pulling this one off? +
Early dinner with bachelor number one, +
late supper with bachelor number two. +
My God, you're turning into a man. +
Apparently, Charlotte had done more than break a pattern. +
She had actually changed genders. +
I just don't know how I'm ever gonna eat two dinners in a row. +
And then, just like that, she was a woman again. +
Sorry, babe. The idiot who drove me here +
apparently passed his driving test in Bangladesh. +
I'm just happy to get off that fuckin' rickshaw in one piece. +
-Kevin, this is Carrie... -Hey. +
...and Samantha, and Charlotte. +
-This is Kevin. -Ah, it's nice to meet ya. +
I-- I have to go make a quick phone call, +
I'll be right back. +
Waitress! Draft beer here! +
He's cute. +
In a tightly wound sort of way. +
He's finding out on Tuesday whether he made partner. +
I'm keeping my fingers crossed +
that he'll unwind some after that. +
What are you doing? +
I just-- I don't want him going off on the waitress. +
That evening, Charlotte set out to break her pattern. +
A casual meal with Eric from yoga, +
where they discovered a mutual love for long drives up Maine coasts, +
and reruns of Nanny and the Professor . +
She was psychic, wasn't she? +
Absolutely. +
No, but it was very subtle, +
very sophisticated. +
I don't even think that kids today would understand it. +
No. I tell you something, when I have kids, +
I'm gonna be a total Nazi with the remote. +
I want them to read. +
How many kids do you want to have? +
Two. +
One of each. +
-Sounds perfect. +
Just as Charlotte began to swim in visions +
of family summers in Kennebunkport, +
she realized she was late for the second shift. +
Oh, my God. +
What's wrong? +
My throat. It-- it's so sore. +
I've just been fighting this, uh, cold all week. +
Oh, well, let, let me get the check. +
I'm, I'm so sorry. +
I had a really great time. +
Yeah. Me, too. +
While Charlotte was off to her next engagement, +
Samantha was imagining an engagement of her own. +
Excuse me, Jesus! +
Hi, I was just wondering, +
do you know who lives in that apartment right there? +
Yes, yes, very nice. +
Musician, his wife, a dancer. +
Really? +
And are they... nice looking? +
Yes, very nice. +
Very good. +
Okay, then. Carry on. +
Later that night, Charlotte was returning from a second dinner +
of steamed mussels and french fries with bachelor number two, +
an art-loving commodities broker. +
-Hey, I had a really great time. -Hey. +
Me, too. +
Oh. +
Excuse me. +
So, can I call you? +
Definitely. +
Okay. +
Charlotte? +
Eric... what are you, what are you doing here? +
I was just leaving you some chicken soup, +
for your throat. +
But I see you've healed. +
Who is this guy? +
I'm the guy she had dinner with before you. +
You... you double-booked us? +
Hey, hey, don't feel bad, bud. +
At least you got the late shift. +
I mean, you get to take her upstairs. +
I don't think so. +
Hey, you know what? Enjoy the soup. +
Hey, you goin' uptown? +
Yeah, West Side. +
Wanna share a cab? +
Sure. +
From that moment on, Charlotte developed a new pattern. +
She made it a rule never to take advice +
from her friends again. +
Very late that night, +
Samantha decided to roll out the welcome mat +
for her new neighbors. +
The musician and the dancer +
turned out to be a middle-aged Eastern European couple. +
He played in a polka band, she was a dancer... +
once upon a time. +
Samantha? +
Would you mind keeping it down? +
I'm trying to get some sleep. +
Samantha broke a pattern after all. +
She decided to move her bed to the opposite wall. +
Later that week, Kevin experienced a dream come true. +
He was made a full partner at the law firm where he worked. +
He took Miranda out to celebrate. +
A toast. +
To a very happy occasion. +
Yeah. I'm falling all over myself with glee. +
Now I get to work 60 hours a week +
for pretty much the same salary. I'm walking on air. +
Can't we enjoy your success for one fucking second? +
You know, it just pisses me off you don't get how much pressure I'm under. +
You really do live in never-never land, don't ya? +
And by the way, +
if there's a difference between this $100 bottle of champagne +
and the crap they sell for 29 bucks, +
it takes a more delicate palate than mine to detect it, +
I don't know. +
Well, I like the champagne, +
and the bread is fabulous. +
Oh, my God, look at those flowers. +
Don't piss me off. +
Where are you goin'? +
Back to never-never land. +
And by the way, never, never call me again. +
Have a nice day. +
What? +
Miranda broke her pattern +
in a way that she had never expected. +
The angry guy had turned her into a cockeyed optimist. +
There could not have been a more perfect moment +
for her to run into Skipper for the first time since she'd dumped him. +
Hey, Skipper! +
Hey, slow down a minute. +
Hey, you know what? Don't tell me what to do, okay? +
I just wanted to say hello. +
How've you been? +
How've I been? +
You know, you got a lot of nerve talking to me +
like nothing happened, ever since you tossed me out like bad milk. +
You know, I'll tell you how I've been, friggin' wonderful, +
now that I've got you out of my system. +
Well, can't I just talk to you for a minute? +
Could I buy you a beer or something? +
Miranda had never seen him as angry as this before. +
Much to her horror, she was attracted. +
That's the thing about patterns. +
They don't just break because you tell them to. +
Have you been working out? +
And a few nights later, John and I went out for a movie. +
I refused to believe that a passionate sexual connection +
could not be translated into a meaningful friendship, at the very least. +
So did you like the movie? +
Was it a comedy? +
-No. -I didn't think so. +
Isn't this the most amazing block? +
All these brownstones are over 100 years old. +
You know, it's like being in the New York +
of Edith Wharton and Henry James. +
Yeah. +
Sometimes I can't believe how lucky I am to live right here. +
What? +
Your tits look really great in that thing. +
At that moment, I knew we only had two things in common. +
Listen, I'd invite you in, but... +
-No, that's okay. +
I got to be up really early tomorrow, so... +
Okay. +
I'll call you. +
Goodnight. +
I knew it was the last time we'd ever see each other. +
And just like that, I was thrown right back into my old pattern... +
greasy Chinese, sleeping till noon, +
and feeling... +
restless. +
欲望城市 +
（性爱专家凯莉布雷萧） +
，做爱伙伴 +
前几天我遇见一位朋友史奇普 +
他刚跟一位女生分手 +
就在我以为我们之间很顺利时 她们突然间提出分手 +
她认为是哪里出了错？ +
你很贴心 +
这不是因为你做错什么 +
我们在不同的处境 +
我们对生活的追求不同 我需要多一点独处的时间 +
我们有着相同的需要： 花多一点时间跟你在一起 +
三个月前，一位名叫蒂芙妮的 牙医保健员也这么说 +
现在的时机不对 你是我认识最好的人之一 +
我觉得现阶段我需要 将重心放在事业上 +
我不想有罪恶感 +
我不希望你放弃你的事业 +
我知道，你一向很好 +
你值得与更珍惜你的人交往 +
我目前不能给你任何承诺 +
去年，米兰达说过同样的话 +
我需要多一点时间独处 +
我觉得现阶段我需要 将重心放在事业上 +
我目前不能给你任何承诺 +
我还能说什么？ +
我真是没有女人缘 +
我应该料到结果会这样 +
女人总是等到我觉得 一切都安定了 +
却又一刀刺进我双眼间 +
你总是被这样的女人吸引 +
一而再，再而三 +
她们不知道自己错过了什么 +
史奇普的遭遇有一个模式： +
他是好人，却总是为 喜欢坏男人的女人吸引 +
在城中的一次约会中 米兰达重复她自己的模式 +
她和法庭上遇见的律师约会 +
全国广播公司的常客 +
凯文不只好辩，也很擅长生气 +
我得修正对于看电影 是白痴的看法 +
花二十九块看电影 外加点心饮料是值得的 +
听后座的公车司机批评电影 +
他有极佳的洞察力 再说，那是一部有趣的电影 +
一部真正的“大国民” +
饰演卡罗的演员很迷人 +
看来脑白质切断术 没有彻底改善他的迟钝 +
我来拦计程车 +
你得面朝住宅区才拦得到 +
我这样拦过很多计程车 +
在梦幻国，人们总是误把 没有天分当作迷人 +
快一点进这辆该死的计程车 +
快 +
快一点，输不起的人，快进去 +
-进去 -老天 +
米兰达讨厌他爱发号司令 除了在一个地方 +
把手举到头上 +
把腿张开 +
奇怪的是我讨厌他 平时告诉我该怎么做 +
但要是在做爱的过程中 真令我神魂颠倒 +
-那里似乎不错 -小心公园里的大便 +
这岂不是很可笑？ +
我日常生活中讨厌的 居然在性生活令我愉快 +
你干脆只把他当作性爱的对象 +
这样的关系真健康呢 +
-我还没准备放弃 -干脆勒死他算了 +
他因为等着当公司合伙人 所以压力很大 +
当事情解决了，他会变好的 +
或是干脆承认你喜欢 脾气暴躁的家伙 +
吃蛋吗？ +
不要管蛋了，史奇普怎么办？ 他从来不生气 +
-你把他甩了，符合这个模式 -我没有什么模式 +
-数学里，乱数也是一种模式 -我就是所谓的质数 +
-她有一个明显的模式 -是吗？是什么？ +
你在等待一个 完美的男人和约会 +
然后你把这样的幻想 投射在他身上，对他有所期待 +
-接着就在你美丽的脸前爆炸幻灭 -蛋要放在不同篮子里 +
-真是个糟糕的模式 -分散风险 +
一次多跟几个男士约会 比较不会感到失望 +
-你要夏绿蒂踏船？ -这是执行多重任务 +
我们不能接受 “一次一个男人”的模式 +
你看你在大人物身上 浪费多少时间 +
大人物是个错误 下次我会找一个英俊 +
可谈感情的四十三岁男子 我知道我该期待什么 +
或者你又会犯相同错误？ +
我在想，我们是不是 条件反射的受害者 +
注定要无意识地重复 某种感情模式？ +
重复与某种特定 类型的人交往？ +
我跟很多艺术家交往过 他们都不尽相同 +
好吧，他们都是有 承诺恐惧症的自恋鬼 +
而且滥用物质 +
但是画家跟雕刻家很不一样 +
英俊，但不懂善待女人 +
我只跟有游戏机 和大胸脯的女人交往 +
那一晚 莎曼珊认识了她的新邻居 +
虽然她没见过他们 却已经对他们了若指掌 +
但她不能忍受别人享受性爱 却没她的份 +
所以她当下决定 如果不能加入，就打败他们 +
这是典型的莎曼珊模式 +
与她的性对象保持一墙之隔 +
跟大人物分手后几个礼拜 我掉进我自己的模式 +
在外面玩到三更半夜 然后一觉到中午 +
在同一家中国餐馆叫外卖 +
在我感到不安的时候 打电话给会支持我的老朋友 +
麦法登 +
-约翰，我是凯莉 -凯莉，你还好吗？好久不见 +
我知道 下班后想不想出来喝杯酒？ +
-当然，好提议 -到“六”酒吧怎么样？ +
-我六点半可以到那里 -到时候见 +
那一晚，准时六点半… +
-很高兴见到你 -我也是，请进 +
-我开了一瓶红酒 -红酒，很棒 +
我八点半要离开 +
好，我八点也有晚餐邀约 +
约翰是所有女人理想中的朋友 +
有趣，令人舒服，好相处 +
跟他在一起，可以做自己 +
不会吵架，没有忧愁 +
你最近还好吗？ +
-很好，你的工作呢？ -从不无聊 +
-你妹妹怎么样？ -是弟弟 +
-搬到凤凰城那一个？ -是塔拉哈西 +
-在那边怎么样？ -他很好，谢谢你关心 +
当时我明白了一件事 我没有感情的模式 +
我只有感情空白期模式 +
每次当我历经分手的创伤后 我总会找约翰 +
他很贴心，英俊，不复杂 +
对我的女性自尊是个抬举 +
谢谢你打给我，美女 +
你令我的生命锦上添花 +
这么多年来我为什么 还把他当候补？ +
经营一段感情有这么难吗？ +
你星期五想共进晚餐吗？ +
晚餐，好，我看一下行程 我想没问题 +
-很好，八点钟怎么样？ -八点十五分 +
就这样，我打破我的模式 +
你不能跟做爱伙伴约会 +
再大声一点 后面那位女士没听到 +
把纯粹用来享受性爱的人 +
当个人一样对待，何必呢？ +
“做爱伙伴”？ 什么是做爱伙伴？ +
少来了 +
做爱伙伴就是约过几次会的人 +
你们之间的性太美好了 所以一直留着他 +
-就像随传随到的小弟弟 -你只是… +
在性欲来时打给他？ +
-没错 -他真的会到？ +
-他有自己的人生 -这你不需要知道 +
在曼哈顿六小时内一定送达 +
你们都有？ +
我的搬到芝加哥了 现在只隔着电话做爱 +
-他在芝加哥做什么？ -我不知道 +
不久后，受到我们对话的鼓舞 +
夏绿蒂第一次邀男士出去 +
课程好难 我从没流过这么多汗 +
你星期五想不想跟我吃晚餐？ +
好 +
我在想，要是夏绿蒂都能 打破模式主动邀约男生 +
我为什么不能和做爱伙伴 +
展开一段较深刻的关系？ +
你穿得好漂亮 +
我也这么想，谢谢 +
其实我本来想说 他从没看过我打扮 +
-想不想先喝杯酒？ -不用了，谢谢 +
等一下 +
我在寿司店订了位 +
那很棒 +
不是，我是说… +
寿司，日本料理 +
你说“吃晚餐”是 真的吃晚餐？ +
每次我们说吃晚餐，总是… +
我知道 +
我去拿钱包 +
就像第一次约会 我们一开始很尴尬 +
黄尾鲽鱼，两份鲑鱼寿司 +
再一份辣的鲔鱼手卷 你喜欢鳗鱼吗？ +
不喜欢，我要烤鸡，全熟 +
-这里的寿司很好吃 -我不吃生的东西 +
你怎么不告诉我？ +
没关系，我等一下买个汉堡 +
好 +
在我忘记之前… +
-这是给你的 -谢谢，是什么？ +
可以在美国境内 打长途四十分钟 +
这是为了促销我们新的方案 +
一周七天，七小时，一天三块 +
-谢谢，你… -你看这些小玩意 +
我是卖时间的 但我有时可以得到这些 +
幸运的话 我下次可以免费拿到一小时 +
你如果是MCI网路公司的顾客 可以免费得到两小时 +
-开玩笑的 -这样… +
我们点清酒吧 +
好，把清酒给我 +
我们回到我家速战速决 +
我得将前两个小时的记忆销毁 +
一个在床上这么厉害的人 平时怎么会这么无聊？ +
莎曼珊很期待与新邻居见面 +
每一晚，在十一点新闻过后 +
莎曼珊就像隐形乐团里 隐形的歌手 +
直到某一晚，她不再是隐形人 +
星期六，米兰达邀我们 跟她的对象见面 +
很显然地，他迟到了 +
-他应该快到了 -没关系 +
-我们也不知道去哪里 -我今晚有约会 +
-我约一个瑜珈课的男生出去 -我很惊讶 +
僵局一打破，接下来就不难了 +
我有很多约会，今晚就有两个 +
你一次约两个人？ +
我不得不，有一个就要出城了 另一个我推不掉 +
你要怎么应付？ +
早一点跟一号吃晚餐 之后再跟二号吃 +
你快变成男人了 +
夏绿蒂不只打破了模式 她还变了性 +
我怎么可能连吃两顿晚餐？ +
就这样，她又变回女人了 +
抱歉，那个白痴司机 把我载到孟加拉了 +
很高兴我还能完整无损的到达 +
凯莉，莎曼珊，夏绿蒂 这是凯文 +
我得打通电话 +
服务生，生啤酒 +
-他很可爱 -紧绷得很可爱 +
他星期二就会知道 能不能成为合伙人 +
我希望之后他能放松一些 +
你在做什么？ +
我不希望他骂服务生 +
夏绿蒂正在打破她的模式 先和瑜珈课的艾力克吃饭 +
发现他们都喜欢同一部影集 +
她是个灵媒，对吧？ +
那真的很难以捉摸 +
今日的孩子不会懂的 +
要是我有小孩，我一定要 很专制地强迫他们阅读 +
-你想要几个小孩？ -两个，一男一女 +
听起来很棒 +
当夏绿蒂开始沉入 自己的幻想时 +
她发现自己快迟到了 +
-我的天 -怎么了？ +
我的喉咙好痛 +
我感冒一个礼拜了 +
我来付钱 +
抱歉，我过得很愉快 +
我也是 +
当夏绿蒂赶到下一个约会 +
莎曼珊正在幻想她自己的约会 +
（莎曼珊，过来打声招呼） +
（希望我们能打破心墙） +
抱歉，请问一下 +
你知道是谁住在里面吗？ +
知道，他们人很好 +
他是音乐家，老婆是舞蹈家 +
真的？长得好看吗？ +
是的，很好，非常好 +
好，继续 +
夏绿蒂刚与热爱艺术的 单身汉二号 +
吃完第二顿晚餐 +
-我今晚很愉快 -我也是 +
抱歉 +
-我可以打电话给你吗？ -当然可以 +
好 +
夏绿蒂？ +
艾力克，你在这里做什么？ +
我帮你带了点鸡汤 治你的喉咙 +
-但我看你好像痊愈了 -他是谁？ +
-我在你之前跟她吃过晚餐 -你同时跟我们约会？ +
不要觉得难过 你应该带她上楼 +
-我不要 -你好好享用鸡汤吧 +
-你要到上城区吗？ -对，西边 +
-要不要一起坐计程车？ -好 +
夏绿蒂发展出一套新模式 +
她决定再也不采信朋友的意见 +
当天晚上 +
莎曼珊决定要给邻居 一个热烈的欢迎 +
他们是中年的东欧夫妇 +
他弹奏波尔卡舞曲 她是个舞者…很久以前是 +
莎曼珊？ +
麻烦你们小声一点 我想要睡个觉 +
莎曼珊终于打破她的模式 +
她决定将床搬到另一面墙 +
那个星期，凯文的梦想成真了 +
他终于成为公司的合伙人 +
他带着米兰达去庆祝 +
为一个快乐的场合举杯庆祝 +
我现在一个星期得工作 六十小时，没加薪 +
我们不能享受你的成功吗？ +
你不知道我身处的压力 +
你真的是住在幻想国 +
这香槟根本不值100元 +
29元的平价酒 都比它多了些香气 +
我喜欢香槟，面包也很棒 +
-你看这些花 -不要惹我生气 +
-你要去哪里？ -回到幻想国 +
还有，不要再打电话给我了 祝你愉快 +
什么？ +
米兰达从没想过结果会是这样 +
易怒的家伙 把她变成自大的乐观主义者 +
再没有比这个更巧的事了 +
在甩掉史奇普后第一次遇见他 +
史奇普 +
-等一下 -不要告诉我该怎么做 +
我只想打声招呼，你还好吗？ +
在你把我像发酸的牛奶 扔掉之后 +
你居然还敢跟我说话 +
你离开后我过得很好 +
我能不能跟你聊一会儿？ 请你喝杯啤酒？ +
米兰达没有看他这么生气过 +
令她恐慌的，她被他吸引了 +
模式不会随你所欲而打破 +
你最近有健身吗？ +
几天后的晚上 约翰跟我去看电影 +
我拒绝相信性关系 +
不能转化成真正的友谊 +
-你喜欢这部电影吗？ -那是喜剧吗？ +
-不是 -我不这么认为 +
这个街区真是太棒了 这些赤褐砂石已经一百年了 +
就像根艾迪丝华顿 和亨利詹姆斯同处纽约 +
有时候我觉得住在这里 真是太幸运了 +
-什么？ -你的奶头看起来好美 +
就在那时候 我知道我们只有两个共同点 +
我想邀请你进来，不过… +
没关系，我明天得早起 +
好 +
-我再打给你 -晚安 +
我知道这是我们最后一次见面 +
就这样我又回到我之前的模式 +
油腻的中国菜，睡到中午 +
感到不安… +
