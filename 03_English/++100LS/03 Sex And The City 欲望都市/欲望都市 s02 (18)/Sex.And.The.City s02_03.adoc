Manhattan... +
For millions of our forefathers, +
the gateway to hope, opportunity and happiness +
beyond their wildest dreams. +
Today that hope is still alive. +
It's called the first date. +
On Saturday nights every restaurant in lower Manhattan +
resembles its own little Ellis Island. +
Hordes of single women crowded into a hot cramped space +
hoping to make it to their final destination... +
The state of matrimony. +
Or at least to get a hot meal in transit. +
Samantha didn't believe in the first date. +
But she did believe in sex after it. +
Mmm. +
Ooh, I think you missed a drop. +
Harrison was a very successful litigator +
who took steam baths with Ron Perlman +
and owned an an apartment on the 39th floor of Museum Tower, +
an excellent first date pedigree. +
After dinner, +
Harrison invited Samantha up to see his view. +
I think you should know my specialty is sexual harassment. +
Really? +
So is mine. +
This is a classic case. +
A classic case of entrapment. +
Beautiful woman, +
-mind altering wine. -Mm-mmm... +
I could claim temporary insanity. +
I do have a prior record of driving men a little crazy. +
You fit the profile. +
Most sexual harassment cases are brought by older women. +
I'm sorry? +
No offense, but c'mon, what are you, 40, 41? +
Samantha had celebrated her 35th birthday +
for as long as we could remember. +
I'm just gonna freshen up. +
Well, I think you're pretty fresh already. +
♪ I'm too sexy for my shirt ♪ +
♪ Too sexy for my shirt ♪ +
♪ So sexy it hurts ♪ +
♪ I'm too sexy for your body ♪ +
Hey sexy, I'm over here. +
There, next to his Brooks Brothers suits, +
was the world's smallest cedar-lined den of iniquity. +
Slap me. +
You've got to be kidding. +
Oh, c'mon. +
Slap me hard. +
Apparently the view left a little to be desired. +
The next night, Samantha invited us to a party she was throwing +
for the new coffee table book du jour. +
The book was awful, +
but the hors d'oeuvres were fabulous. +
Well, you got to give the guy credit. +
It takes a lot of work to get all rigged up like that. +
Yeah, most of my first dates don't even open the cab door. +
Hey, what if he's still hanging there? +
The super would find him eventually. +
You see, this is why I don't date. +
The men out there are freaks. +
Well, that's completely unfair. +
I'm sorry, if a man is over 30 and single +
there's something wrong with him. +
It's Darwinian. They're being weeded out from propagating the species. +
Okay, what about us? +
We're just choosy. +
I'm getting more shrimp. +
You know what the worst part of the date was? +
Harrison actually thought I was 40. +
-Really? -Really. +
Do you think I look 40? +
If Samantha's past four birthdays taught me anything, +
it was that there is only one answer to a question like that. +
You don't look a day over 35. +
This is a great party. +
I just met the most amazing guy, +
Mitchell Saylor. +
When Charlotte really liked a guy, +
she said his whole name. +
It helped her to imagine their future monogrammed towels. +
Mitch Saylor? +
Yeah, do you know him? +
Oh, honey, I know of him. +
Well, well, what is that supposed to mean? +
Ladies, I suggest you join me in the bathroom. +
-He's "Mr. Pussy." -Mr. Who? +
Suddenly Charlotte's monogrammed towels +
were looking very different. +
He's renowned, he loves going down on women. +
He's so cute to be so nasty. +
That's disgusting! +
I told you there'd be something. +
He's a legend. He's just amazing at eating pussy. +
Would you please just stop calling it that? +
Oh, fine, going down, giving head. +
Eating out? +
I never understood that, shouldn't it be eating in? +
Stop it, stop it, stop it! +
You do do that, right? +
Of course! +
I just... I don't have to talk about it. +
The reality was, +
the only thing that went down with any regularity on Charlotte's dates +
was a gold American Express card. +
Forget it. I'm not dating anyone who is known as "Mr. Pussy." +
Why not? +
Well, maybe I want more than that. +
Oh, sweetie, if a man is good at that, there is nothing more. +
-Amen. -Amen. +
You have to be talking about Mitch Saylor. +
He's unbelievable. +
I dated him for a month. +
He was so good, I actually passed out when I came. +
Enjoy. +
Well, the guy's got good word of mouth. +
Oh, my God, right over there. That's... that's him. That's Mr... +
Unlike Miranda, +
I wasn't ready to accept that all single men were freaks. +
I was so optimistic that I had actually agreed +
to go on my first blind date in two years. +
P.J. was a very successful independent movie producer. +
His documentary on endangered seagulls +
had just aired to excellent reviews on PBS. +
So documentary films, that must be fun. +
Look, let's be realistic. +
I'm only doing this docu bullshit to earn a rep, you know? +
I mean, ultimately I want to parlay into the action movie arena. +
I want to make money. +
I'm not afraid to say it, okay? I love money. +
I would sell toilet bowls if it would make me a millionaire. +
What about the seagulls? +
Fuck the seagulls. +
Step right up, folks. +
Two vodkas and a 12 dollar pasta +
buys your admission to see the man with no soul. +
Observe if you dare, this chilling sight. +
Bachelor number two seemed promising. +
Just so you know, I can't see a movie without popcorn. +
-I'm a junior mints kind of guy. -Mmm. +
This relationship is probably doomed. +
You want to lean a little closer? +
Maybe hear our entire conversation? +
Hey, here's a better idea, +
why don't you and your fucking girlfriend +
just sit on our laps during the movie? +
Then you won't miss a fucking word, dick! +
Ladies and gentlemen, stand far away from... +
the man with two faces. +
They say the third time's the charm. +
Max was a broker who had made two million on bonds last year. +
We had a great dinner in Little Italy. +
Not only did Max have two million, +
he also appeared to have a lending library in his pants. +
Parents, please keep the kiddies away from the cage of... +
The man who steals cheap used books for no reason. +
Okay, now I was afraid. +
Apparently the men in the dating world had devolved +
since the last time I visited. +
Maybe Miranda was right. +
Maybe they should never have outlawed freak shows, +
because at least then the freaks were rounded up in one place. +
Now they're out there among us, roaming free. +
Is it true? +
Are all men freaks? +
Apparently Charlotte's week went a little better than mine. +
On Monday night she was finally ready +
to let Mitch under her sheets... +
Way under. +
Sorry. +
It tickles. +
Just relax. +
Relax. +
That night Charlotte came harder than she ever had before. +
That is, until Tuesday. +
Oh! Oh, yes, oh, yes! +
- [Carrie] Wednesday... -Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes! Uh-huh... +
Thursday... Uh-huh... +
Friday.. . -Oh God! Oh! +
Friday... -Oh God! Oh,God! Ah... +
Oh! Oh, God! +
Friday... -Oh, God! Oh, God! +
Oh, God! Oh... +
That night Charlotte saw God seven times. +
For a lapsed Episcopalian, it was a very good Friday. +
If Mitch was a freak, +
Charlotte was ready to run away and join the circus. +
Meanwhile, all I wanted to do was run away. +
Rough night? +
Bad date. +
Been there. +
He was a kleptomaniac. +
Last month I went out with a woman who slept with her shoes on. +
Hi, Carrie. +
Ben. +
I was instantly attracted. +
But I was pretty sure I could feel webs between his fingers. +
So when did you guys all become freaks? +
Us? +
No, the shoe woman seemed totally normal. +
Then a month in I discover she's a freak. +
They hide it really well. +
That's why I don't date anymore. +
Women are bizarre. +
Thank you. +
Sometimes in a good way. +
I once saw the world's fattest twins at a state fair. +
They were both married. +
Their wives were very skinny. +
Maybe it was an optical illusion. +
Maybe. +
Would you have dinner with me? +
I thought you didn't date. +
I don't. It... it would be a non-date. +
A non-date. +
Maybe. +
Is that a yes? +
Let's call it a non-no. +
And it was then that the most freaky thing happened. +
There in the middle of Manhattan, +
two complete strangers gave out their unlisted phone numbers. +
Meanwhile, Samantha was about to have her own chance encounter. +
Samantha? +
Monica! +
Look at you. +
You look amazing. +
Don't I? It's the work. +
I had the fat from my ass injected into my face. +
And look, like a baby's bottom. +
-Unbelievable. -Isn't it? +
Fat from my own ass. +
Oh, and the best part is, you get to eat like a pig before, fatten up your ass. +
And then a week later, poof! It's in your face. +
Gotta go, bye. +
An hour later, Samantha had her first Big Mac +
and an appointment with the most expensive plastic surgeon +
on Upper Fifth. +
Meanwhile, I had my own ass to be obsessed with +
and it belonged to Ben, +
an editor at a hip political magazine +
who made me laugh. +
This is me. +
Then I guess this is goodnight. +
You know, uh... +
Normally I would try to get upstairs, but... +
since this is a non-date. +
So no kiss. +
Well... +
Maybe a non-kiss. +
There was nothing "non" about it. +
A week and three non-dates later, +
Samantha summoned us to make an announcement. +
You've got to be kidding. +
It's sitting in a fat repository in Queens as we speak. +
And in three days it will be in my face +
and I will look fabulous. +
I can't believe this. We spend our lives trying to hide the fat in our ass, +
and you're gonna put it right out there on your face? +
I just have to wear this girdle for a week to keep my skin tight. +
-Oh! -Yikes. +
Wow, look at that, huh. +
Well, that's a girdle with a hole. +
Well, of course it has a hole, it's for peeing, etcetera. +
Etcetera? +
Last night I slept with a Calvin Klein model. +
I've never felt sexier. +
I think the fat's already gone to your head. +
Could you please put your skirt down? +
Oh, right. -God. +
Whatever happened to aging gracefully? +
It got old. +
I got to go, I'm meeting Mitch at my apartment. +
Ooh, so how is he? +
He is amazing. +
He makes me so happy. I think we have a real chance at a future together. +
You and Mr. Pussy. +
His name is Mitchell. +
Hang on, honey. +
You don't fall in love with Mr. Pussy. +
You enjoy him and then set him free. +
To Samantha, Charlotte had committed the ultimate sin. +
She was bogarting Mr. Pussy. +
He's a freak! +
Aside from technique what do you even know about the guy? +
-Do you even talk? -Do you even fuck? +
-Stop it. Sweetie, Miranda has a point. +
I mean, have you guys had dinner together, +
have you seen a play, anything? +
No, but we could. +
You know what? I think you've fallen into the sex haze. +
You know, where the sex is really great +
and then you start acting like a crazy person. +
Then you start to imagine the relationship is something it's not. +
Charlotte's not having a relationship. +
She's having multiple orgasms. +
He makes me happy. +
Hoping to prove Miranda wrong, +
I had convinced her to come out on a double non-date +
with Ben's friend Luke. +
Things were actually going remarkably well. +
Favorite ice cream. +
Strawberry. +
Oh, I see, you're boring. +
I like to see it as traditional. +
Traditional? Traditional can be good. +
Nothing makes you feel like more of a non-couple +
than creating another non-couple. +
Unfortunately, our smugness was a little premature. +
So, what are you doing this weekend? +
Uh, big plans. +
I'm gonna go see my granddad in Connecticut. +
Uchh... Connecticut? +
What's wrong with Connecticut? +
I hate the country. +
I haven't left Manhattan in ten years. +
And you're proud of that? +
Everything you want is right here. +
Culture, food, the park. +
Cabs at three a.m., why leave? +
Perhaps to experience a world outside Manhattan. +
There is no world outside Manhattan. +
I had unwittingly set Miranda up on a date with "Manhattan Guy," +
a genetically mutant strain of single man that fed on Zabar's +
and midnight shows at the Angelika. +
No, thanks. +
I like the city. +
I also happen to like the country. +
This does not make me a freak. +
You're obviously not from here. +
I have to go feed my cat. +
Miranda had invoked our code phrase. +
Honed over years of bad parties, awful dates, +
and phone calls that wouldn't end. +
Unfortunately, I wasn't ready to accept defeat. +
I thought you already fed your cat. +
I have to feed it again. +
Cat people are freaks. +
-Where are you going? -Home. +
The man has not left Manhattan in a decade, Carrie. +
He's obviously a freak. +
And by the way, if Luke's a freak, +
Ben is bound to be a freak too. +
You can tell everything about a person +
by who their friends are. +
God, I hope not. +
That night I couldn't get Miranda's freaky comment +
out of my head. +
So... +
Is there anything weird about you I should know +
before this gets any more compromising? +
Well, now that you mention it, there is. +
Oh... +
It's adorable. +
Yeah, it's a souvenir from a drunken bachelor party a few years ago. +
Yeah, my friend's marriage didn't last, +
-but Tweety Bird did. -Mmm. +
So what about you? +
You're probably perfect, huh? +
No. +
Three stitches. +
I got into a fight with a third grade bully. +
You're scrappy. +
I like scrappy. +
And then the amazing tattooed man made love to me. +
And it didn't feel weird at all. +
While Miranda was busy feeding her pussy, +
Charlotte was trying to do everything but. +
Did you ever go to summer camp? +
There, over the exotic fruit plate, +
Charlotte tried to make a relationship happen. +
I loved camp. +
I went to this place in Maine called Minihaha. +
We used to play these big games of color war. +
I was always a red. +
It was so much fun. +
And then they made us stop +
because they said that it glorified warfare. +
You're awfully quiet tonight. +
What are you thinking about? +
Charlotte realized Miranda was right. +
She had stayed too long at the fair. +
From that moment on, +
Charlotte couldn't be in the same room with a fig. +
Some people might call that a little odd. +
Meanwhile, Samantha was about to get her own special showing. +
Voila. +
I love it, what else can you do? +
To Samantha, surgery was like being at Barney's. +
Once you're in the door, you might as well shop. +
We can always lift a little here. +
Take care of these lines. +
Here... +
In five years we can augment the breasts, +
pick them up a little, in ten years, a tummy tuck. +
Uh-huh... Oh, lipo. +
Yeah, yeah. The hip and the thigh area. +
Doctor, you're-- you're needed on the phone. +
Knee lift. +
Samantha felt like she had walked into a fun house. +
Only it wasn't particularly funny. +
I'm late for my soccer game. +
Stay here. +
I'll be back in two hours. +
It had happened. +
We had done it and now I really liked him. +
I was deep into the sex haze, and completely freaked out. +
There had to be something sick and off about him. +
If the rest of the species had devolved, +
Ben would have to be a freak to survive. +
I had to find out what was wrong +
before I wasted the next six months. +
It started innocently enough. +
I just wanted to see what the guy ate... +
Listened to... +
Dated. +
Then it took on a life of its own. +
Somewhere in this hip, normal looking apartment, +
was the clue to Ben's inner freakiness. +
And I wasn't gonna rest until I found it. +
There it was, taunting me. +
Ben's secret box of freakdom. +
Home of elicit photos, love letters, +
maybe an old marriage license. +
Carrie. -Oh! +
What the hell are you doing? +
I don't know. +
I can't explain it. I... +
I guess I was... +
Looking for something. +
Something? +
Something... freaky. +
It's my cub scout badge collection. +
I was gonna skip the game to be with you. +
I thought you were actually a normal one. +
I was. +
I'm gonna go. +
Good idea. +
That was the day I came face to face with my freak. +
The frightening woman whose fear ate her sanity. +
The truth is, it isn't just the men. +
It's all of us. +
Anyone who's single in Manhattan +
gets a little freaked out from time to time. +
But we keep trying, because you have to figure, +
if the world's fattest twins can find love +
there's hope for all of us. +
Somewhere out there +
is another little freak who will love us, understand us, +
and kiss our three heads and make it all better. +
And in the meantime, +
we always have Manhattan. +
欲望城市 +
（性爱专家凯莉布雷萧） +
，怪人秀 +
曼哈顿，对我们的前人而言 +
是通往希望与幸福的入口 +
今日，那个希望仍然存在 那就是第一次约会 +
周六夜晚，每一家餐厅 都像座小型的埃利斯岛 +
成群的单身女子聚集 +
希望能实现她们 最终的目标：步入礼堂 +
或是至少好好饱餐一顿 +
莎曼珊不相信第一次约会 她只相信随之而来的性 +
你掉了一滴 +
哈里森是个成功的诉讼律师 和朗柏尔曼洗过蒸汽浴 +
住在高级大厦的三十九楼 +
第一次约会的绝佳人选 +
晚餐后，哈里森邀请莎曼珊 到家中看夜景 +
-我的专长是性骚扰 -真的吗？我也是 +
这是一桩典型的案例 一桩典型引诱的案例 +
美丽的女人 让人意乱神迷的酒… +
-我可以声称是一时意乱 -我曾让男人神魂颠倒 +
你正是典型的案例 性骚扰者通常是年纪大的女人 +
-你说什么？ -绝无冒犯之意 +
不过，你几岁了？ 四十？四十一？ +
自我们有印象以来 莎曼珊一直是三十五岁 +
-我去梳洗一下 -你一点都不需要 +
性感宝贝，我在这里 +
就在他的衣柜旁边 +
有着世界上最迷你的变态屋 +
-掌掴我 -你开玩笑的吧 +
来吧，用力地掌掴我 +
很显然的，那场景令人不悦 +
隔晚，莎曼珊约我们参加派对 +
在一家不接受订位的新餐厅 +
那里的开胃菜真的是太棒了 +
要这么狼狈还真不简单 +
我的约会对象甚至 不帮我开计程车门 +
-要是他还关在里面呢？ -管理员会找到他的 +
-所有的男人都是怪人 -这样说不公平 +
要是男人超过三十岁还是单身 那他一定有问题 +
他们在进化过程中被淘汰 +
-那我们怎么说？ -我们只是太挑剔了 +
我要多一点虾子 +
最糟糕的是 他以为我四十岁了 +
-真的？ -真的，我看起来有四十吗？ +
莎曼珊过去四年的生日 告诉我们一件事 +
这个问题只有一个答案 +
你看起来不超过三十五 +
这个派对真不错，我遇见一个 很棒的人，米契赛勒 +
当夏绿蒂喜欢一个人的时候 她会说他的全名 +
这有助于她幻想他们的未来 +
-米契赛勒？ -你认识他？ +
我很了解他 +
什么意思？ +
姐妹们，请跟我到洗手间 +
-他是小妹妹先生 -什么先生？ +
突然间夏绿蒂的未来蒙上阴影 +
-他喜欢替女人口交 -他看起来不像那种人 +
好恶心 +
-我就说一定有什么不对劲 -他独钟舔小妹妹这件事 +
-不要再那样说了 -好吧，口交，舔蜜桃 +
-吸出来？ -应该是舔进去吧？ +
-住口… -你不排斥吧？ +
当然，但是我不喜欢谈论 +
夏绿蒂约会的对象 有一个共通点 +
他们都有美国运通金卡 +
我才不跟被称作 小妹妹先生的人约会 +
-为什么不？ -我想要的不只那些 +
一个男人在这方面很行 你就别无所求了 +
你一定是在说米契赛勒 他真的很棒 +
我跟他约会了一个月 +
他让我高潮来时差点昏厥过去 +
好好享受吧 +
大家都对他赞不绝“口” +
我不同意米兰达的说法 单身男子不一定是怪人 +
我近乎绝望 我考虑两年后接受相亲安排 +
皮杰是个成功的独立制片 +
他拍摄濒临绝种海鸥的 纪录片广受好评 +
纪录片，一定很有趣 +
我拍纪录片的目的 只是为了赢得一点名气 +
我的最终目的是赚钱 +
我爱钱，要是卖马桶能致富 我也会卖 +
-那些海鸥怎么办？ -去他的海鸥 +
各位看倌 两杯伏特加就能让人见识到… +
没有灵魂的男人 +
看过这些令人心寒的例子 单身汉二号似乎很有希望 +
我看电影不能没有爆米花 +
我个人偏好薄荷糖 这段关系似乎被下了诅咒 +
想再更靠近一点吗？ 偷听我们所有谈话？ +
你跟你女朋友不如 坐在我们腿上看电影 +
这样就可以一字不漏听个够 +
各位先生女士，请不要接近… +
双面人 +
有人说第三次的约会最甜美 +
麦斯买卖债券赚了两百万 +
我们在小意大利 享用了完美的晚餐 +
麦斯不只拥有两百万 +
他的裤袋里显然有一座 借来的图书馆 +
各位家长 请让你们的小孩远离… +
无故偷窃廉价二手书的人 +
现在我开始害怕了 +
可以约会的男人似乎已经退化 +
或许怪人秀应该要被合法化 +
至少以前怪人集中在一处 现在他们四处游荡 +
真的是这样吗？ 男人全都是怪人？ +
夏绿蒂的一周比我的好一些 +
周一夜晚，她终于准备好 让米契钻进她的被窝 +
从下面 +
-抱歉，我会痒 -没关系，放轻松… +
那一晚 夏绿蒂的高潮来得比以前激烈 +
直到星期四… +
星期三… +
星期二… +
-星期五… -我的天… +
-星期五… -天…我的天… +
-星期五 -天…我的天… +
那一晚，夏绿蒂见了上帝七次 +
对于一个圣公会成员而言 那是个很棒的星期五晚上 +
如果米契是怪人 夏绿蒂已经决定投奔到马戏团 +
在此同时，我只想要逃走 +
难熬的一晚？ +
-糟糕的约会 -我也有过 +
他有窃盗癖 +
上个月我跟一个 穿鞋睡觉的女人约会 +
凯莉 +
班恩 +
我马上就被吸引了 +
但我可以感觉到 他指间的蜘蛛网 +
-男人何时全成了怪人？ -我们？ +
穿鞋睡觉的女人看起来正常 但我马上发现她是怪人 +
她们都隐藏得很好 所以我不再约会了 +
-女人很奇怪 -谢谢 +
奇怪不一定不好 +
我曾在一个博览会 看过世上最胖的双胞胎 +
他们的老婆却骨瘦如柴 +
-或许那是错觉 -或许吧 +
能跟我吃顿饭吗？ +
-你不是不约会 -这是个“非约会” +
“非约会”？ +
或许吧 +
-这是答应了吗？ -这是“不是不答应” +
于是，最奇怪的事发生了 +
就在曼哈顿中心 +
两名陌生人交换了 最私人的电话号码 +
莎曼珊正要遭逢 意想不到的偶遇 +
-莎曼珊？ -莫妮卡 +
看看你，气色真好 +
可不是，我把臀部的脂肪 注射到脸上 +
-看，就像婴儿的屁股 -真不可思议 +
可不是吗？我臀部的脂肪 +
最好的是你可以 大吃大喝养肥屁股 +
一个星期后就跑到你脸上了 +
得走了 +
一个小时后 莎曼珊吃了久违的麦香堡 +
并和最昂贵的外科医师有约 +
也有一个臀部深深吸引着我 那就是班恩的 +
他是嬉皮政治杂志的编辑 很会逗我笑 +
-那是我 -这代表着该说晚安了 +
通常我会试图上楼，但既然… +
这是一个“非约会”… +
所以不能亲吻？ +
或许可以有“非亲吻” +
这当中没有“不”的成分在 +
一个礼拜后 莎曼珊做出惊人的宣言 +
你没有开玩笑 +
它还躺在皇后区的脂肪储藏库 +
三天后就会到我脸上 我将会美得不得了 +
我们每天想尽办法 掩饰臀部的脂肪 +
你却要将它放在脸上 +
我得穿束裤一个礼拜 +
你看 +
上面有一个洞 +
当然要有洞 用来尿尿…之类的 +
我昨天跟卡文克莱的 模特儿睡觉 +
-脂肪已经跑进你的脑袋 -把裙子放下 +
难道不能优雅地变老？ +
-旧观念了 -我得走了，我要跟米契见面 +
他还好吗？ +
他太棒了，我们可能有未来 +
-你跟小妹妹先生？ -他的名字是米契 +
你不能爱上小妹妹先生 +
享受过后就放他自由 +
对莎曼珊而言 夏绿蒂犯下一个终极的错误 +
她把小妹妹先生英雄化 +
他是个怪人 你对他了解多少？ +
-你们聊天吗？ -或是做爱？ +
-不要说了 -米兰达说得有理 +
你们吃过晚餐吗？ 去看过表演？ +
没有…我们可以 +
你被性爱迷惑了 +
因为太美好了 你开始变得不正常 +
以为这是一段关系，事实不然 +
夏绿蒂有的是数不清的高潮 而不是一段关系 +
他让我快乐 +
为了证明米兰达说错了 +
我邀她和班恩的朋友路克 来一次双对约会 +
事情进行得非常顺利 +
-最爱的冰淇淋口味？ -草莓 +
-我知道了，你很无趣 -我觉得这是传统 +
传统可以是好的 +
这样的感觉真的是太棒了 +
制造出另一对“非情侣” +
然而我们得意得太早 +
你这个周末要做什么？ +
我要去康乃狄格探望爷爷 +
康乃狄格？ +
-康乃狄格有什么不好？ -我讨厌乡下 +
-我十年没离开曼哈顿了 -你沾沾自喜？ +
你想要的一切这里都有 +
文化，美食，公园 半夜三点的计程车，何必离开 +
去体验曼哈顿以外的世界？ +
曼哈顿以外没有世界 +
我安排米兰达和一个 曼哈顿男人约会 +
一个靠午夜场表演长大的 突变种单身汉 +
我喜欢城市 +
我也喜欢乡下 我这样并不奇怪 +
你一定不是这里出身的 +
我得回家喂猫了 +
米兰达说了我们的密语 +
在无数次糟糕派对 和约会中解救我们 +
但我还不想投降 +
-你不是喂过猫了？ -我得再喂一次 +
养猫的都是怪人 +
-你要去哪里？ -回家 +
那个男人十年不曾离开曼哈顿 他是个怪人 +
要是路克是怪人 班恩一定也是个怪人 +
你可以从一个人交往的朋友 看出他的个性 +
天，希望不是这样 +
那一晚，我不断地回想 米兰达的怪人理论 +
那么… +
你有没有什么 我不知道的怪癖？ +
你终于问了，在这里 +
很可爱 +
单身汉派对酒后的纪念品 +
我朋友的婚姻没了 但小鸟却还在 +
你呢？或许你很完美 +
缝过三针 +
我跟三年级的恶霸打架 +
你真爱逞凶斗狠，我喜欢 +
然后这位刺青的男子跟我做爱 +
一点也不奇怪 +
当米兰达在喂猫的同时 夏绿蒂想尽办法聊天 +
你有去过夏令营吗？ +
就在异国水果区旁边 夏绿蒂试着展开一段关系 +
我爱露营，曾在缅因州露营 +
我们会玩战争游戏 我总是在红队，很好玩 +
后来大人决定不举行 因为他们觉得这是赞扬战争 +
你今晚异常安静 你在想什么？ +
夏绿蒂相信米兰达是对的 她在博览会流连太久了 +
从此以后 夏绿蒂开始痛恨无花果 +
有些人或许觉得她很奇怪 +
在此同时，莎曼珊即将重生 +
太完美了，你还可以做什么？ +
对莎曼珊而言 手术就像逛百货公司 +
既然来了，就顺便逛逛 +
我们可以把这里抬高一点 +
雕塑出这些线条 +
五年后，可以隆乳 +
把它们抬高一点 十年后，可以做肚子 +
还有嘴唇 +
臀部跟大腿这边 +
医生，有你的电话 +
提高膝盖 +
莎曼珊觉得自己站在哈哈镜前 +
只是一点都不好笑 +
我足球赛要迟到了 +
不要走，我两个小时后回来 +
就这样发生了 我们做爱，我很喜欢他 +
我深深地被性爱迷惑 完全失控 +
他一定有什么病态之处 +
要是男人这个物种退化了 班恩一定是存活下来的怪人 +
我得在浪费青春之前 找出哪里有问题 +
一开始还算正常 我想知道他吃什么 +
听什么… +
跟谁约会 然后就一发不可收拾 +
在这栋公寓的某处 一定有着班恩怪异的线索 +
我不找到不罢休 +
它就躺在那里，取笑我 班恩的秘密怪异盒 +
里面藏着不正当的照片，情书 或是他以前的结婚证书 +
你在做什么？ +
我不知道，我无法解释 +
我想…我在找某样东西 +
某样东西？ +
某样怪异的东西 +
是我的童子军徽章收藏盒 +
我取消比赛来陪你 +
-我以为你很正常 -曾经是 +
-我要走了 -好提议 +
就在那天 我遇见了奇怪的自己 +
一个理智被恐惧吃掉的疯女人 +
不只是男人，而是每一个人 +
每一个曼哈顿的未婚男女 有时会做出怪异的举动 +
但是我们仍不放弃 +
最胖的双胞胎可以找到真爱 我们也可以 +
在某处总有另一个小怪人 +
会爱我们，了解我们 +
亲吻我们的三个怪头 安慰我们 +
同时，我们永远拥有曼哈顿 +
