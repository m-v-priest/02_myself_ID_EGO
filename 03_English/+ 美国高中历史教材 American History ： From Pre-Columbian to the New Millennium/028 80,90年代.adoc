.Ronald Wilson Reagan 罗纳德·里根

image:/img/Official_Portrait_of_President_Reagan_1981.jpg[,30%]


第40任美国总统（1981年－1989年）.

里根推行的经济政策为供应面经济学，被人称为"里根经济学". +
也被称为"trickle-down economics 涓滴效应学 "（不进行财富再分配，而是反过来使有钱人更富有，大企业随后大量花费及投资，使社会各阶层皆获益）.

.trickle-down economics : 下渗经济学 /涓滴经济学
用于描述给富人及企业减税, 可惠及所有人包括贫苦大众的经济政策.

*该主张认为, 政府对富人阶级减免税收, 与向企业提供经济上的优待政策，将可改善经济整体，最终会使社会中的贫困阶层人民也得到生活上的改善。*

该主张反对以"征税手段"来减少社会中的贫富差距，也往往削减对贫穷阶层进行社会救助。

但这也会导致社会贫富差距扩大.

**美国经济在历经1981－1982年的急剧衰退后，于1982年开始了非常茁壮的经济成长，到他任期结束并一直持续。**

**他始终强调他对于"联邦政府在处理问题上的能力"抱持着怀疑态度，尤其是在经济问题方面。**他的解决方式是撤回政府的干涉吗并减少税率和商业管制，以此让自由市场机制能自动修正所面临的问题。他在就职典礼那天曾说过：“*政府并不是解决问题的方法，政府本身才是问题所在。*"

里根在政治意识形态上, 贯彻了反共主义与民主资本主义。*1989年, "里根"离任时的支持率为68%，使他同"富兰克林·罗斯福", 及之后的"比尔·克林顿", 并列成为近现代史上"离任时拥有最高支持率"的总统。*

His message was clear. +
Government has become too big and needs (v.) *to be trimmed (v.) down* （使）变小；缩减 to size. +
Taxes are insanely 疯狂地；狂暴地；精神错乱地 high /and need to be cut to stimulate (v.)促进，激发（某事物） growth and investment. +
Military spending should be increased /to fix the degenerating 衰退，退化 state of the American war machine. +
Morality and character need to be reemphasized (v.)再度强调，重新强调 in American life. +

The United States is still the largest superpower in the world with the best system of government. +
It's time to feel (v.) good about being an American again.

[.my2]
他的信息很明确。政府已经变得太大，需要缩减规模。税收非常高，需要削减以刺激增长和投资。应该增加军费开支，以修复美国战争机器日益恶化的状况。在美国生活中, 需要重新强调道德和品格。美国仍然是世界上最大的超级大国，拥有最好的政府体系。是时候再次为自己成为一名美国人而感到高兴了。


Reagan's election brought (v.) a dramatic change to the federal government. +
No president, Republican or Democrat, had attempted to reduce the size of the federal government since Franklin Roosevelt initiated (v.)开始；发起；创始 his New Deal. +
The tax cut 减税 that was handed (v.) to the American people  `谓`  benefited _wealthy (a.)富有的；富裕的；富饶的 Americans_ most, with the hope that their increased income `谓` would *trickle (v.)（使）滴，淌，小股流淌 down to* poorer Americans — the so-called trickle-down theory 涓滴理论. +

The economic stagnation （一国经济的）不景气，停滞；（水）不流动 of the 1970s did come to an end, but *at the cost of* huge federal deficits  [财政]赤字，亏损 and the increasing poverty rate.

[.my2]
*里根的当选, 给联邦政府带来了巨大的变化。自富兰克林·罗斯福发起新政以来，没有一位总统，无论是共和党还是民主党，试图缩小联邦政府的规模。给予美国人民的减税政策, 使富裕的美国人受益最多，他们希望他们增加的收入能够惠及较贫穷的美国人——即所谓的"涓滴理论"。 20 世纪 70 年代的经济停滞确实结束了，但代价是巨额联邦赤字, 和不断上升的贫困率。*

.Iran-Contra Scandal
chatgpt: 在这里，"Contra" 指的是尼加拉瓜的反政府武装力量，即“反抗军”（Contras）。在1980年代，"伊朗门"（Iran-Contra Scandal）是美国历史上一个重大政治丑闻，涉及美国政府非法向伊朗出售武器, 并将所得资金秘密转移给尼加拉瓜的反政府武装“反抗军”，以资助他们对抗尼加拉瓜的桑地诺政府。

维基: 1983年起，10多名美国公民被黎巴嫩真主党绑架。时任美国中央情报局局长威廉·卡西, 从以色列外交官大卫·金奇那里获悉，正处于两伊战争的伊朗, 急需武器装备. 而伊朗与真主党关系密切，如果能够向伊朗提供军火，让其从中发挥影响，则有可能促使真主党释放美国人质，同时还可以改善不断恶化的美伊关系，减缓伊拉克在海湾地区的扩张。

由于伊朗为美国的敌人，美国国会禁止向其出售武器，因此本计划所有的武器, 都是秘密通过第三方出售。促使更多的美国人质被释放。

同时，奥利弗·诺斯还负责给尼加拉瓜的反政府武装康特拉提供援助。由于之前国会通过了博兰修正案 ，该法案限制美国政府援助康特拉，因此中情局采纳军火商的建议，将卖导弹的钱转移一些“回扣”给中情局，中情局再用这笔钱, 支援康特拉颠覆尼加拉瓜政权的活动。

[.my2]
1980 年竞选期间，罗纳德·里根宣布了解决国家经济混乱的良方。*他声称，过度的税收负担、过度的政府监管, 和大规模的社会支出计划, 阻碍了经济增长。里根提议在其总统任期的前三年, 分阶段减税 30%。减税的大部分将集中在高收入阶层。这一计划背后的经济理论, 被称为“供给侧经济学”或“涓滴经济学”。*



Tax relief 税收减免 for the rich `谓` would enable (v.) them to spend and invest (v.) more. +
This new spending `谓` would stimulate (v.) the economy and create new jobs. +
Reagan believed that /a tax cut of this nature 种类；类型 `谓` would ultimately generate (v.) even more revenue 收入，收益 for the federal government. +
The Congress was not *as sure as* Reagan, but they did approve _a 25% cut_ during Reagan's first term.

[.my2]
*这个计划的结果好坏参半。最初，美联储认为, "减税"将重新引发"通货膨胀", 并提高"利率"。这引发了1981年和1982年的严重衰退。"高利率"导致国际汇市上, 美元升值，使得美国商品在国外更加昂贵。结果，出口减少，而进口增加。最终，经济在 1983 年稳定下来，里根政府的剩余几年, 呈现出国家经济增长。*

The defense industry 国防工业 boomed as well. +

国防工业也蓬勃发展。里根坚称，在核防御方面，美国对苏联敞开了“脆弱之窗”。大量政府合同被授予国防公司, 以升级国家军队。里根甚至提出了一种名为“战略防御计划”的天基导弹防御系统。科学家们对击落敌方导弹的激光制导系统的可行性, 表示怀疑。批评者称该计划为“星球大战”。

波罗的海国家：指位于波罗的海东岸的三个国家，即爱沙尼亚、拉脱维亚和立陶宛。这三个国家都是北约、欧盟、欧元区和经合组织的成员。 +
波罗的海三个国家, 均被世界银行列为"高收入经济体"，并保持着非常高的"人类发展指数"。

第一次世界大战（1914-1918）后，“波罗的海国家”一词指的是波罗的海沿岸从前俄罗斯帝国获得独立的国家。该术语包括爱沙尼亚、拉脱维亚、立陶宛, 以及芬兰（后来改为北欧国家）。 +
第二次世界大战（1939-1945）后，该术语被用来统称 1991 年之前被苏联占领的三个国家：爱沙尼亚、拉脱维亚, 和立陶宛。与此同时，芬兰却被称为另一个地缘政治集团的成员：北欧国家。


image:/img/BALTIC STATES.png[,60%]

1940年6月，红军占领了爱沙尼亚、拉脱维亚和立陶宛的全部领土，并建立了新的亲苏联傀儡政府。随后一致申请加入苏联.  +
苏联试图通过驱逐和将俄语作为唯一的工作语言, 等手段将其占领的领土"苏维埃化"。 1940年至1953年间，苏联政府将超过20万波罗的海国家的人, 驱逐到苏联的偏远地区。此外，至少有75,000人被送往"古拉格集中营"。大约 10% 的波罗的海成年人, 被驱逐出境或送往劳改营。

1941 年，苏联对波罗的海国家的占领, 因纳粹德国入侵该地区而中断。 +
苏联于 1991 年 9 月 6 日承认三个波罗的海国家的独立。 +

这三个国家都宣称自己是1918年至1940年存在的主权国家的恢复者，并强调他们的论点，即苏联在冷战时期对波罗的海国家的统治, 是非法占领和吞并。

2002年，波罗的海各国政府申请加入"欧盟", 并成为"北约"成员国。三国均于 2004 年 3 月 29 日成为北约成员国，并于 2004 年 5 月 1 日加入欧盟。

.Gulag
劳动改造营管理总局，简称"古拉格", 指的是苏联的监狱和劳改营网络，并在更广泛的意义上，代表整个苏联强迫劳动系统。 +
1918年至1960年间，古拉格成为苏联政府国家安全部门一个下属机构，负责管理全国的劳改营，其中在“去斯大林化”以及“赫鲁晓夫解冻”时期大规模缩减，直至被废除.

从1930年到1953年，至少有1800万人被关押在集中营中，超过270万人死于集中营或流放. 在斯大林生命的最后几年，古拉格的囚犯人数达到了最高水平，约为250万。

专家们现在推论, 苏联总共有大约2870万到3200万人, 被迫进行强迫劳动。

.克林顿医保改革

美国医疗问题主要体现在： +

- 很多人没有医疗保险，据1991年的人口普查统计，当时约有3 700万人没有任何医疗保险，占总人口的15％.
- 医疗费用高，1992年美国医疗总费用占到GDP的14％，而且有不断增长的趋势。

1993年10月，克林顿正式向国会递交了长达1 342页的《医疗保障法案》(Health Security Act)，其内容包括：

- 扩大医保覆盖范围。强制雇主补助员工, 来购买"私营医疗保险"，保险费由雇主承担80％、员工缴纳20％。政府对小企业、失业者和穷人提供医疗补贴。
- 建立"健康同盟"。这是病人和医生间的"非盈利性中介组织"，加入"健康同盟"必须缴纳一定的保险费，**同盟则为成员提供各种医疗保险方案的信息，帮助成员选择优质、经济的保险方案，**并替他们付款。*组建"健康同盟"的目的是将以往分散的单个病人联合起来，在与保险公司、医院和医生进行价格谈判时，可以发挥团体优势，从而降低医疗费用*，提高医疗质量。

经过持续的激烈辩论，几经修订，克林顿医保方案最终也没有通过。主要原因是:

- **医疗保险行业也反对，他们担心在新体制下, 会受到政府的严格监管，**从而丧失自主权力和盈利空间。

=== The Reagan Years 里根时代 (1980年代)

Americans were fed up.

In 1980, confidence in the American economy and government hit rock bottom. Looking for a change and the promise of a better future, voters turned to RONALD REAGAN for answers.


His message was clear. Government has become too big and needs to be trimmed down to size. Taxes are insanely high and need to be cut to stimulate growth and investment. Military spending should be increased to fix the degenerating state of the American war machine. Morality and character need to be reemphasized in American life. The United States is still the largest superpower in the world with the best system of government. It's time to feel good about being an American again.


Reagan's election brought a dramatic change to the federal government. No president, Republican or Democrat, had attempted to reduce the size of the federal government since Franklin Roosevelt initiated his New Deal. The tax cut that was handed to the American people benefited wealthy Americans most, with the hope that their increased income would trickle down to poorer Americans — the so-called trickle-down theory. The economic stagnation of the 1970s did come to an end, but at the cost of huge federal deficits and the increasing poverty rate.

The 1980s were a decade of scandals. The Iran-Contra Scandal proved that White House officials were willing to break the law to carry out their political agenda. Religious leaders like JIM BAKKER and JIMMY SWAGGERT became mired in dirty sex scandals. Moral turpitude ended the political career of Colorado Democrat GARY HART, who might well have been president one day. A SAVINGS AND LOAN SCAM fleeced American taxpayers for billions and billions of bailout dollars.

As the decade came to a close, it became clear that the malaise of the 1970s was over. The United States received a boost of confidence when the Cold War came to an end in 1991. The menace of a threatening Soviet Union now belonged to history, and the United States claimed the status of the only remaining superpower in the world.

'''

==== "Morning in America"

The long national nightmare was over.

The United States was filled with hard-working, God-fearing citizens who cared about their fellow Americans. Inflation and unemployment were problems of government, not the national character. Vietnam was over; America was the most powerful nation in the world. The Soviet Union was an evil empire. Old-fashioned initiative and ingenuity would maintain America's competitive edge in commerce.

These themes soothed a nation sick with the malaise of the 1970s. When all had seemed lost, a grandfatherly figure stepped forth and optimistically reassured Americans that the age-old beliefs they held about the grandeur of the United States were not myths.

This man, Ronald Wilson Reagan, understood the sprit of the times, and his message, personality, and politics dominated the 1980s.

Traditionally, working-class Americans, Southerners, Catholics, and urban dwellers had strong ties to the Democratic Party. The Republicans relied heavily on support from the rural Midwest, Protestant leaders, and wealthier voters. Ronald Reagan built a new coalition for the Republican Party in his quest for the Presidency in 1980.



Working Americans were shocked to see unemployment rates nearing double digits. Inflation was pushing the middle class into tax brackets previously reserved for the affluent classes. Reagan promised to reduce their level of misery with sound fiscal policy. Southerners disgruntled by affirmative action and busing found friendly ears in the Reagan campaign. The endorsement of Reagan by the Protestant establishment did not deter devout Catholics from voting Republican, since Reagan promised to oppose abortion rights and promote family values.

Crime-plagued city denizens looked to Reagan for comfort as he portrayed himself as the law and order candidate. Americans across demographic lines were warmed by his promises for a stronger America domestically and overseas. Very quickly, these "REAGAN DEMOCRATS" crumbled the old alignment. Jimmy Carter, his opponent in the 1980 election, never stood a chance.

'''

==== Reaganomics


The media called it Reaganomics.

During the campaign of 1980, Ronald Reagan announced a recipe to fix the nation's economic mess. He claimed an undue tax burden, excessive government regulation, and massive social spending programs hampered growth. Reagan proposed a phased 30% tax cut for the first three years of his Presidency. The bulk of the cut would be concentrated at the upper income levels. The economic theory behind the wisdom of such a plan was called SUPPLY-SIDE or TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS.



Tax relief for the rich would enable them to spend and invest more. This new spending would stimulate the economy and create new jobs. Reagan believed that a tax cut of this nature would ultimately generate even more revenue for the federal government. The Congress was not as sure as Reagan, but they did approve a 25% cut during Reagan's first term.

The results of this plan were mixed. Initially, the FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD believed the tax cut would re-ignite inflation and raise interest rates. This sparked a deep recession in 1981 and 1982. The high interest rates caused the value of the dollar to rise on the international exchange market, making American goods more expensive abroad. As a result, exports decreased while imports increased. Eventually, the economy stabilized in 1983, and the remaining years of Reagan's administration showed national growth.

The defense industry boomed as well. Reagan insisted that the United States was open to a "WINDOW OF VULNERABILITY" to the Soviet Union regarding nuclear defense. Massive government contracts were awarded to defense firms to upgrade the nation's military. Reagan even proposed a space-based missile defense system called the STRATEGIC DEFENSE INITIATIVE. Scientists were dubious about the feasibility of a laser-guided system that could shoot down enemy missiles. Critics labeled the plan "STAR WARS."


Budget deficits

Ronald Reagan's increased spending and accompanying tax cuts resulted in dramatic budget deficits during the 1980s. A deficit occurs when spending exceeds revenues in any year.



Economists disagreed over the achievements of REAGANOMICS. Tax cuts plus increased military spending would cost the federal government trillions of dollars. Reagan advocated paying for these expenses by slashing government programs. In the end, the Congress approved his tax and defense plans, but refused to make any deep cuts to the welfare state. Even Reagan himself was squeamish about attacking popular programs like Social Security and MEDICARE, which consume the largest percentages of taxpayer dollars. The results were skyrocketing deficits.

The national debt tripled from one to three trillion dollars during the REAGAN YEARS. The President and conservatives in Congress cried for a balanced budget amendment, but neither branch had the discipline to propose or enact a balanced budget. The growth that Americans enjoyed during the 1980s came at a huge price for the generations to follow.

'''

==== Foreign and Domestic Entanglements


Ronald Reagan, Cold Warrior.


He believed the United States could ill afford to sit passively while communism expanded aggressively. He announced the REAGAN DOCTRINE, which pledged American support to "FREEDOM FIGHTERS" opposing Communism any where on the globe.

'''

==== The End of the Cold War


When Mikhail Gorbachev assumed the reins of power in the Soviet Union in 1985, no one predicted the revolution he would bring. A dedicated reformer, Gorbachev introduced the policies of glasnost and perestroika to the USSR.

The unraveling of the SOVIET BLOC began in Poland in June 1989. Despite previous Soviet military interventions in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Poland itself, Polish voters elected a noncommunist opposition government to their legislature. The world watched with anxious eyes, expecting Soviet tanks to roll into Poland preventing the new government from taking power.



Gorbachev, however, refused to act.

Like dominoes, Eastern European communist dictatorships fell one by one. By the fall of 1989, East and West Germans were tearing down the BERLIN WALL with pickaxes. Communist regimes were ousted in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. On Christmas Day, the brutal Romanian dictator NICOLAE CEAUSESCU and his wife were summarily executed on live television. Yugoslavia threw off the yoke of communism only to dissolve quickly into a violent civil war.

Demands for freedom soon spread to the Soviet Union. The BALTIC STATES of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania declared independence. Talks of similar sentiments were heard in UKRAINE, the CAUCASUS, and the CENTRAL ASIAN states. Here Gorbachev wished to draw the line. Self-determination for Eastern Europe was one thing, but he intended to maintain the territorial integrity of the Soviet Union. In 1991, he proposed a Union Treaty, giving greater autonomy to the Soviet republics, while keeping them under central control.


When Mikhail Gorbachev assumed power of the Soviet Union in 1985, he instituted the policies of glasnost and perestroika in hopes of sparking the sluggish economy. What resulted from this taste of freedom was the revolution that ended the Cold War.

That summer, a coup by conservative hardliners took place. Gorbachev was placed under house arrest. Meanwhile, BORIS YELTSIN, the leader of the RUSSIAN SOVIET REPUBLIC, demanded the arrest of the hardliners. The army and the public sided with Yeltsin, and the coup failed. Though Gorbachev was freed, he was left with little legitimacy.

Nationalist leaders like Yeltsin were far more popular than he could hope to become. In December 1991, Ukraine, BYELORUSSIA, and RUSSIA itself declared independence and the Soviet Union was dissolved. Gorbachev was a president without a country.

Americans were pleasantly shocked, but shocked nonetheless at the turn of events in the Soviet bloc. No serious discourse on any diplomatic levels in the USSR addressed the likelihood of a Soviet collapse. Republicans were quick to claim credit for winning the Cold War. They believed the military spending policies of the Reagan-Bush years forced the Soviets to the brink of economic collapse. Democrats argued that containment of communism was a bipartisan policy for 45 years begun by the Democrat Harry Truman.

Others pointed out that no one really won the Cold War. The United States spent trillions of dollars arming themselves for a direct confrontation with the Soviet Union that fortunately never came. Regardless, thousands of American lives were lost waging proxy wars in Korea and Vietnam.

Most Americans found it difficult to get used to the idea of no Cold War. Since 1945, Americans were born into a Cold War culture that featured McCarthyist witchhunts, backyard bomb shelters, a space race, a missile crisis, détente, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the Star Wars defense proposal. Now the enemy was beaten, but the world remained unsafe. In many ways, facing one superpower was simpler than challenging dozens of rogue states and renegade groups sponsoring global terrorism.

Americans hoped against hope that the new world order of the 1990s would be marked with the security and prosperity to which they had become accustomed.


'''

=== Toward a New Millennium

The last decade of the 20th century was marked with dizzying change for the United States. With the Soviet Union out of the picture, American diplomats sought to create a "NEW WORLD ORDER" based on democracy, free-market capitalism and the Western lifestyle.

'''


==== Operation Desert Storm

The first major foreign crisis for the United States after the end of the Cold War presented itself in August 1990. Saddam Hussein, the dictator of Iraq, ordered his army across the border into tiny Kuwait. This was no ordinary act of aggression. Iraq's army was well equipped. The United States had provided massive military aid to Iraq during their eight-year war with Iran, giving them the fourth largest army in the world.

Kuwait was a major supplier of oil to the United States. The Iraqi takeover posed an immediate threat to neighboring Saudi Arabia, another major exporter of oil. If Saudi Arabia fell to Saddam, Iraq would control one-fifth of the world's oil supply. All eyes were on the White House, waiting for a response. President Bush, who succeeded President Reagan, stated simply: "This will not stand."




In the last months of 1990, the United States participated in the defense of Saudi Arabia in a deployment known as Operation Desert Shield. Over 500,000 American troops were placed in Saudi Arabia in case of an Iraqi attack on the Saudis. The U.S. further sought multilateral support in the United Nations Security Council. Traditionally, Iraq was an ally of the Soviet Union, who held a veto power over any potential UN military action. Looking westward for support for their dramatic internal changes, the USSR did not block the American plan. The UN condemned Iraq and helped form a coalition to fight Saddam militarily.

Bush, remembering the lessons of Vietnam, sought public support as well. Although there were scant opponents of the conflict, the vast majority of Americans and a narrow majority of the Congress supported the President's actions. When all the forces were in place, the United States issued an ultimatum to Saddam Hussein: leave Kuwait by January 15,1991 or face a full attack by the multinational force.


January 15 came and went with no response from the Iraqis. The next night Desert Shield became Desert Storm. Bombing sorties pummeled Iraq's military targets for the next several weeks. On many days there were over 2500 such missions. Iraq responded by launching Scud missiles at American military barracks in Saudi Arabia and Israel. Attacking Israel was a stratagem to persuade all the neighboring Arab nations to join the Iraqi cause. After intense diplomatic pressure and negotiation, the Arab nations remained in opposition to Iraq.

On February 24, the ground war began. Although the bombing lasted for weeks, American ground troops declared Kuwait liberated just 100 hours after the ground attack was initiated. American foot soldiers moved through Kuwait and entered southern Iraq. This posed a dilemma for the United States. The military objectives were complete, but Saddam, the perpetrator of the unprovoked invasion of Kuwait, was still ruling Iraq from Baghdad. President Bush feared that the allies would not support the occupation of Baghdad. Concerns were raised that if Saddam's regime were toppled, the entire nation could disintegrate into a civil war. Soon Iraq agreed to terms for a ceasefire, and the conflict subsided.



Iraq did not leave Kuwait untouched. Millions of dollars of valuables were plundered by the occupying troops. As Iraq retreated, they detonated explosives at many of Kuwait's oil wells. The disaster to the environment grew as Iraq dumped oil into the Persian Gulf. The costs were enormous, and casualty figure staggering. Although estimates range in the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi deaths, only 148 Americans were killed in the battle. This was primarily because of the technological advances of the United States.

The United States passed its first test of the post-Cold War world. Skillful diplomacy proved that the United Nations could be used as an instrument of force when necessary. Although Moscow did not contribute troops to the operation, they gave tacit approval for the attack. The potential for multinational cooperation was demonstrated. The largest American military operation since Vietnam was completed with smashing success. Most Americans felt confident in their military and technological edge once more. President Bush promptly declared that the "new world order had begun."


'''

====  A Baby Boomer in the White House


President Bush enjoyed an approval rating in March 1991 of 91 percent for his handling of Operation Desert Storm. As the Presidential race for 1992 began to unfold, many potential candidates were scared to challenge him and look to 1996 as a better opportunity. But the recession that battered the American economy would not go away. As growth remained low and unemployment persisted, some of the shine began to wear off the President. Not since JAMES MONROE'S second term in 1820 had a sitting President been re-elected during an economic slump.



Enter Bill Clinton.

The two candidates could hardly have been more different. Bush was a hero of World War II and had extensive Washington experience, including heading the CIA, Ambassador to the United Nations, and eight years as Vice-President.

Clinton was born after World War II and did not fight in Vietnam, so he faced constant charges of dodging the draft. He had no experience on the federal level of government; he simply was the popular governor of Arkansas. Throughout the campaign, scandal after scandal hit Clinton. Charges of adultery were addressed on television. When accused of smoking marijuana in the 1960s, Clinton confessed — but added that he did not inhale. Rumors of a real estate scandal called WHITEWATER surfaced from time to time. Clinton was no "Teflon" candidate. Everything stuck to him, but none of it mattered in the end.

His campaign adviser posted a sign over his desk that read simply: "IT'S THE ECONOMY, STUPID." With a charismatic smile and a gentle, sincere voice, Clinton hammered away at the recession, and promised new ideas and a break with twelve years of Republicans in the White House.


Election Day belonged to Bill Clinton. Although he garnered only 43% of the popular vote, he beat President Bush handily in the electoral tally. Bush earned 38% of the vote, and Perot reached an impressive 19% of American voters. Much of Clinton's support came from baby boomers. Clinton's victory marked an end to the domination of politics by the World War II generation. Americans who had come of age during the turbulent sixties and seventies now had a representative in the White House.

'''

==== 克林顿医改 (失败)

It seemed like Bill Clinton had everything going for him. He defeated an incumbent President and became the first Democrat to win the White House since Jimmy Carter defeated Gerald Ford. He had a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate to work with him.

One of the first major initiatives he began was health care reform. Many Americans were concerned about spiraling medical costs. Medicare did not cover prescription drugs and only paid a portion of health care costs. Over 20 million Americans had no HEALTH INSURANCE whatsoever. Clinton assembled a task force to study the problem and assigned his wife HILLARY to head the committee. She became the most politically active first lady since Eleanor Roosevelt.

Eventually Clinton presented a plan to limit costs and insure each American citizen to the Congress. Powerful interest groups representing doctors and insurance companies opposed Clinton. Many in the Congress thought the program too costly. Conservatives compared the plan to socialized medicine. Despite a "friendly" Democratic Congress, the Clintons' proposal was defeated.


As the year 2000 approached, partisan politics were as toxic as ever. Republicans claimed that they fixed the economy and Clinton got the credit. Regardless of who gets the credit or blame, the 1990s were a decade of very steady economic growth. The crippling budget deficits of the 1980s were finally brought under control, and Americans enjoyed low inflation, low unemployment, low interest rates and a booming stock market. Even the bad blood between the two parties could not change that.

'''


==== The End of the American Century


The NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT (NAFTA) ended economic barriers with Canada and Mexico and promised even more prosperity.


Why then did so many Americans feel uneasiness and uncertainty as the 21st century approached? Economic challenges were created by the prosperous Pacific Rim and a stronger European Union. Despite prosperity, real incomes stagnated for the bottom half of American wage earners. Although legal barriers to equality were largely eliminated for American minority groups, economic equality was but a dream. Women made advances toward equity, but still earned less than 75 cents for every dollar earned by American males. Many Americans felt they were working longer hours for less.


Pessimists depicted America as a civilization in decline. The rise of the divorce rate led to many children being raised in broken homes. Gun violence was a major problem. SCHOOL SHOOTINGS became commonplace.

Will the 21st century also be an American century? Or will the United States be eclipsed by new superpowers like China or the EUROPEAN UNION? Only time will reveal the answers.

In the meanwhile, the United States will rely on its history of increasing democracy and respect for human rights, its dynamic diversity, and the innovative character of its people to seek new solutions to whatever problems may arise.
