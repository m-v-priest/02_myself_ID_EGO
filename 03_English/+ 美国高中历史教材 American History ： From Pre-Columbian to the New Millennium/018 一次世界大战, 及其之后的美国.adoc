=== America in the First World War 第一次世界大战中的美国


Isolation 隔离；隔离状态 was a long American tradition.
Since the days of George Washington, Americans struggled to remain protected by the mighty oceans on its border. +
When European conflicts erupted, as they frequently did, many in the United States claimed exceptionalism 例外论；例外主义.
America was different.
Why get involved in Europe's self-destruction?

When the ARCHDUKE 大公（旧时奥地利皇太子） OF AUSTRIA-HUNGARY 奥匈帝国 was killed in cold blood, igniting (v.)（使）燃烧，着火；点燃 the most destructive war in human history, the initial reaction in the United States was the expected (a.)预料的；预期的 will (n.) for neutrality. +

As a nation of immigrants, The United States would have difficulty picking a side. +
Despite the obvious ties to Britain based on history and language, there were many United States citizens who claimed Germany and Austria-Hungary as their parent lands. +
Support of *either* the ALLIES *or* the CENTRAL POWERS `谓` might prove divisive (a.)有争议的，造成分裂的.

[.my2]
**孤立主义是美国的一项悠久传统。**自乔治·华盛顿时代以来，美国人一直努力通过其边界的浩瀚海洋来保护自己。当欧洲的冲突频发时，许多美国人声称自己是例外的。美国是不同的。为什么要卷入欧洲的自我毁灭？当奥匈帝国的大公在冷酷地被杀害，引发了人类历史上最具破坏性的战争时，美国的最初反应是期望保持中立。**作为一个移民国家，美国将很难选择站在哪一边。尽管基于历史和语言的明显联系，与英国的联系显而易见，但有许多美国公民声称德国和奥匈帝国是他们的祖国。支持协约国或中央同盟国, 可能会引发分歧。**

In the early days of the war, as Britain and France struggled (v.)斗争；抗争 against Germany, American leaders decided it was in the national interest to continue trade with all sides as before. +
A neutral nation cannot impose (v.)强制推行，强制实行 an embargo 禁运，贸易禁运 on one side and continue trade (v.) with the other and retain its neutral status. +
In addition, United States merchants and manufacturers feared that a boycott （对某事物的）抵制 would cripple (v.)使残疾，使成为跛子 the American economy. +

Great Britain, with its powerful navy, had different ideas. +
A major part of the British strategy was to impose a blockade （尤指对港口的）包围，封锁 on Germany. +
American trade (n.) with the Central Powers simply `谓` could not be permitted. +

The results of the blockade were astonishing. +
Trade with England and France `谓` more than tripled (v.)成三倍，增至三倍 between 1914 and 1916, while trade with Germany was cut (v.) by over ninety percent. +
It was this situation that prompted submarine warfare 战；作战；战争 by the Germans against Americans at sea. +
After two and a half years of isolationism 孤立主义, America entered the Great War.

[.my2]
*战争初期，当英国和法国与德国作斗争时，美国领导人认为像以前一样继续与各方进行贸易,* 符合美国国家利益。**中立国​​不能"对一方实施禁运, 而继续与另一方进行贸易"并保持中立地位。此外，美国商人和制造商担心, 抵制会削弱美国经济。**拥有强大海军的英国, 却有不同的想法。**英国战略的一个主要部分, 是对德国实施封锁。****美国与同盟国的贸易, 根本不可能被德国允许。**封锁的结果令人震惊。 1914 年至 1916 年间，*与英国和法国的贸易增加了两倍多，而与德国的贸易则减少了百分之九十以上。正是这种情况, 促使德国人在海上对美国人发动潜艇战。经过两年半的孤立主义，美国加入了第一次世界大战。*


The contributions of the United States military to the Allied effort `系` were decisive (a.)决定性的；关键的. +
Since the Russians decided to quit the war, the Germans were able to move many of their troops *from* the eastern front *to* the stalemate (n.)僵局；和棋 in the West. +
The seemingly infinite (a.)无限的；无穷尽的 supply of fresh American soldiers `谓` countered  (v.)抵消，抵制 this potential advantage and was demoralizing (v.)使泄气；使意志消沉；使士气低落 to the Germans. +
American soldiers entered the bloody trenches 战壕 and by November 1918, the war was over. +

[.my1]
.案例

.stale·mate
-> 来自古义 stale,固定的，僵持的，mate,杀，将军，词源同 checkmate.引申比喻义僵局。

.demoralize
-> de-, 不，非，使相反。moral, 道义，士气。即使士气低落。

====


Contributions to the war effort were not confined to the battlefield 战场；沙场. +
The entire American economy was mobilized (v.) to win the war. +
*From* planting extra vegetables *to* keeping the furnace 火炉，熔炉 turned off, American civilians 平民 *provided* extra food and fuel *to* the war effort. +
The United States government engaged in 参与,从事 a massive propaganda campaign to raise (v.) troops and money. +
Where dissent (n.)（与官方的）不同意见，异议 was apparent, it was stifled (v.)（使）窒息;无法自如地呼吸;压制；扼杀；阻止；抑制, prompting (v.) many to question (v.) whether American _civil liberties_ 公民自由；公民权力 were in jeopardy 处于危险境地；受到威胁. +

In the end, the war was won, but the peace was lost. +
The Treaty of Versailles 凡尔赛（法国城市） as presented by President Wilson `谓` was rejected by the Senate. +
Two dangerous decades of political isolationism `谓` followed, only to end (v.) in an ever more cataclysmic (a.)灾难性的；极不成功的；大变动的 war.

[.my2]
美国军队对盟军的贡献, 是决定性的。自从俄罗斯人决定退出战争后，德国人就能够将许多军队, 从东线转移到西线的僵局中。看似无限的美国新兵供应, 抵消了这一潜在优势，并使德国人士气低落。美国士兵进入血腥的战壕，到 1918 年 11 月，战争结束了。美国对战争的贡献并不局限于战场。整个美国经济都被动员起来, 以赢得战争。**从种植额外的蔬菜, 到关闭炉子，美国平民为战争提供了额外的食物和燃料。美国政府进行了大规模的宣传活动, 来筹集军队和资金。任何明显的异议, 都会被压制，这促使许多人质疑美国的公民自由是否处于危险之中。**  最终，战争胜利了，却失去了和平。威尔逊总统提出的《凡尔赛条约》被参议院否决。随后的两个危险的政治孤立主义十年，最终以一场更加灾难性的战争结束。

==== Farewell to Isolation 告别隔离



With American trade becoming more and more lopsided (a.)一侧比另一侧低（或小等）的；向一侧倾斜的；不平衡的 toward the Allied cause, many feared that it was only a matter of time before the United States would be at war. +
`主` The issue that propelled (v.)推动；驱使 most American fencesitters 观望者，中立者 *to side (v.)支持某人（反对…）；和某人站在一起（反对…） with* the British `系` was German submarine warfare.

[.my2]
**随着美国的贸易越来越向盟军倾斜，许多人担心, 美国陷入战争只是时间问题。**促使大多数美国骑墙派最终站在英国一边的原因, 是德国潜艇战。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.lop·sided
-> lop,垂下，耷拉，side,边。即向一侧倾斜的。
====

The British, with the world's largest navy, had effectively shut (v.)  down （使）关张，停业，倒闭 German maritime trade. +
Because there was no hope of catching the British in numbers of ships, the Germans felt that the SUBMARINE was their only key to survival. +
One "U-BOAT" could surreptitiously 偷偷地；秘密地；不正当地 sink (v.)使下沉；使沉没 many battleships, only to slip (v.) away unseen. +
This practice would stop *only if* the British would lift their blockade.

[.my2]
英国拥有世界上最大的海军，实际上已经封锁了德国的海上贸易。由于没有希望在数量上追上英国人，德国人认为潜艇是他们生存的唯一关键。一艘“U型潜艇”可以秘密击沉许多战列舰，却又悄无声息地溜走。只有英国解除封锁，这种做法才会停止。



The isolationist American public had little concern if the British and Germans tangled on the high seas. +
The incident that changed everything `系`  was the sinking of the LUSITANIA. +
The Germans felt they had done their part to warn (v.) Americans about the danger of overseas travel.

[.my2]
奉行孤立主义的美国公众, 并不担心英国和德国在公海上发生争执。改变一切的事件是"卢西塔尼亚号"的沉没。德国人认为他们已经尽了自己的一份力量, 来警告美国人海外旅行的危险。

The German government purchased _advertisement space_ in American newspapers warning that `主` Americans who traveled on ships carrying war contraband (n.)（非法带入或带出国境的）禁运品，走私货 `谓` risked submarine attack. +
When the Lusitania departed (v.) New York, the Germans believed the massive _passenger ship_ 客船 was loaded with munitions 军需品；军火 in its _cargo hold_ 货舱. +
On May 7, 1915, a German U-boat torpedoed (v.)用鱼雷袭击（或击沉） the ship without warning, *sending* 1,198 passengers, including 128 Americans, *to* an icy grave. +
The Lusitania, as it turned out, was carrying over 4 million rounds 圆形物体；圆块;一次射击；一发子弹 of ammunition 弹药，军火.

[.my2]
**德国政府在美国报纸上购买了广告版面，警告乘坐"载有战争违禁品的船只"旅行的美国人, 有遭到潜艇袭击的危险。**当卢西塔尼亚号离开纽约时，德国人认为, 这艘巨大的客轮的货舱里装满了弹药。1915年5月7日，一艘德国潜艇在没有任何警告的情况下, 用鱼雷击沉了这艘船，导致1198名乘客(包括128名美国人)葬身冰冷的坟墓。事实证明，卢西塔尼亚号载有400多万发子弹。

[.my1]
.案例

.con·tra·band
-> contra-, 相对，相反。-ban, 命令，禁令。拼写受band影响。
====

The sinking of _the British ship RMS Lusitania_ in 1915, helped *move* American public opinion *away* from neutrality. +
Nearly 1200 civilians lost (v.) their lives in the German torpedo attack, 10% of them American.

[.my2]
1915 年英国皇家邮轮卢西塔尼亚号沉没，使美国公众舆论不再保持中立。近1200名平民在德国鱼雷袭击中丧生，其中10%是美国人

President Wilson was enraged 使发怒；触怒. +
The British were breaking the rules, but the Germans were causing deaths.

[.my2]
威尔逊总统被激怒了。英国人违反了规则，但德国人却造成了死亡。

Wilson's Secretary of State, William Jennings Bryan, recommended a ban on American travel on any ships of nations 后定 at war. +
Wilson preferred a tougher 严厉的；强硬的；无情的 line against the German Kaiser 凯撒;（德国）皇帝. +
He demanded (v.)强烈要求 an immediate end to submarine warfare, prompting Bryan to resign (v.) in protest 抗议；抗议书（或行动）；反对. +
The Germans began (v.) a 2-year practice of pledging (v.)保证；（使）保证；承诺给予（或提供） to cease (v.) submarine attacks, *reneging (v.)违背（诺言）；背信弃义；食言 on* that pledge  (n.)誓言，保证，承诺, and issuing (v.)宣布；公布；发出 it again /under U.S. protest 抗议，反对.

[.my2]
威尔逊的国务卿威廉·詹宁斯·布莱恩, 建议禁止美国乘坐任何交战国家的船只。威尔逊更倾向于对德国皇帝采取更强硬的路线。他要求立即停止潜艇战，促使布莱恩辞职以示抗议。德国人开始了为期两年的承诺停止潜艇攻击的做法，后来又违背了这一承诺，并在美国的抗议下再次发出这一承诺。

[.my1]

Wilson had other reasons for leaning toward the Allied side. +
He greatly admired the British government, and `主` democracy in any form `系` was *preferable (a.)较适合；更可取 to* German authoritarianism 独裁主义；权力主义. +
The historical ties with Britain seemed to draw (v.) the United States closer to that side.

[.my2]
威尔逊选择倾向于盟军, 还有其他的原因。他非常钦佩英国政府，任何形式的"民主", 都比德国的"威权主义"更可取。与英国的历史联系, 似乎使美国更接近英国。

Many Americans felt a debt to France for their help in the American Revolution. +
Several hundred volunteers, appropriately 适当地，恰当地 named the LAFAYETTE ESCADRILLES （尤指一战的）法国飞行中队, already volunteered to fight (v.) with the French in 1916. +
In November of that year, Wilson campaigned 进行竞选活动，发起运动 for re-election with a peace platform （政党的）纲领，政纲，宣言. +
"He kept us out of war," read 写着；写成 his campaign signs, and Americans narrowly returned (v.) him to the White House. +
But peace was not to be.

[.my2]
许多美国人感到欠法国对美国革命的帮助。 1916 年，数百名志愿者（被恰当地称为“拉斐特救兵团”）自愿加入法国人的战斗。当年 11 月，威尔逊以和平纲领竞选连任。他的竞选标语上写着“他让我们远离战争”，美国人险些让他重返白宫。但和平并没有实现。

.Lafayette Escadrille
Lafayette Escadrille 是第一次世界大战（1914-1918 年）期间法国空军部队 Escadrille N 124 的名称。这支航空军部队主要由驾驶战斗机的美国志愿飞行员组成。它的名字是为了纪念美国独立战争中的法国英雄拉斐特侯爵。 1917 年 9 月，Escadrille 被转移到美国陆军.

In February 1917, citing (v.)引用；引证 the unbalanced U.S. trade with the Allies, Germany announced a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare. +
All vessels spotted in the war zone would be sunk immediately and without warning. +
Wilson responded by severing (v.)切开；割断;断绝；中断 diplomatic relations with the German government.

[.my2]
1917年2月，德国以"美国与盟国的贸易不平衡"为由，宣布了无限制"潜艇战"政策。所有在战区发现的船只, 都将在没有任何警告的情况下, 立即被击沉。威尔逊的回应是, 断绝与德国政府的外交关系。

Later that month, British intelligence intercepted (v.)拦截；拦阻；截住 the notorious 声名狼藉的，臭名昭著的 ZIMMERMANN TELEGRAM. +
The German foreign minister sent a message 后定 courting (v.)（为有所求，尤指寻求支持而）试图取悦，讨好，争取 support from Mexico *in the event* 万一如果 the United States should enter the war. +
Zimmermann promised 允诺，许诺 Mexico a return of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona — territories it had lost in 1848.

[.my2]
当月晚些时候，英国情报部门截获了臭名昭著的"齐默曼电报"。德国外交部长发出信息，寻求墨西哥在美国参战时提供支持。齐默尔曼向墨西哥承诺, 归还德克萨斯州、新墨西哥州, 和亚利桑那州 ——墨西哥在 1848 年失去的领土。


[.my1]

.intercept
-> inter-,在内，在中间，相互，-cept,拿，握，词源同capable,capture.引申词义阻截，拦截。


.齐默尔曼电报
德国建议, 墨西哥可以与德国结成对抗美国的军事联盟. +
内容是:

- 我们计划于2月1日开始实施"无限制潜艇战"(不予以警告, 就攻击商船)。与此同时，我们将竭力使美国保持中立。
- 如计划失败，我们建议在下列基础上同墨西哥结盟：我们将会向贵国提供大量资金援助：**墨西哥也会重新收复在新墨西哥州、得克萨斯州，和亚利桑那州失去的国土。**建议书的细节将由你们草拟。
- 请务必于得知将会与美国开战时（把此计划）以最高机密告知贵国总统，并鼓励他邀请日本立刻参与此计划；同时为我们与日本的谈判进行斡旋。
- 请转告贵总统，我们强大的潜水艇队的参与, 将可能逼使英国在几个月内求和。

最后，墨国认为联盟计划不可行。因为：

- 试图收复失去的国土, 一定会令墨国与军事上更加强大的美国开战。
- *无论德国是否真的会有那么慷慨，它的财政支持仍然将会几乎一文不值，因为墨国没有可能使用那些财政支持, 去获取武器和其它军事装备。美国拥有全美洲唯一具有规模的武器制造商，而且英国皇家海军, 长期控制跨大西洋航线，令德国无从提供些足供墨国收复失土的武器和军事设备。*
- 即使墨国成功收复失地，容纳或安抚当地的英语人口, 将会是一个严苛且困难的考验。

齐默尔曼电报的曝光, 促使同年4月6日美国向德国的宣战。

War Declared on Germany

[.my2]
对德国宣战

A tempest 大风暴；暴风雨；暴风雪 of outrage followed. +
More and more Americans began to label (v.) Germany as the true villain 反面人物，反派主角;恶棍；坏蛋 in the war. +
When German subs 潜艇 sank several American commercial ships in March, Wilson had an even stronger hand to play. +
On April 2, 1917, he addressed the Congress, citing a long list of grievances 抱怨，不平 against Germany. +
Four days later, by a wide margin in each house 议院；议会；国会, Congress declared war on Germany, and the U.S. was plunged into the bloodiest battle in history.

[.my2]
随之而来的是一阵愤怒的暴风雨。越来越多的美国人开始将德国视为战争中真正的恶棍。当德国潜艇三月份击沉几艘美国商船时，威尔逊的表现更加出色。 1917 年 4 月 2 日，他在国会发表讲话，列举了一长串对德国的不满。四天后，国会以参众两院的巨大优势对德国宣战，美国陷入了历史上最血腥的战斗。

.villain
-> 来源于拉丁语villa(别墅,田庄,农场)。 词根词缀： villa田庄(a略) + -ain名词词尾,人 → 乡村乃粗俗之地,坏人较多 同源词：villa

.had an even stronger hand to play
chatgpt的解释: +
的意思是“拥有了更有力的筹码可以使用”。 +

这里的 "play hand" 属于英文短语 "have a strong hand to play" 或 "play one's hand" 的变体。这个短语来源于牌类游戏，意思是“拥有有力的筹码或有利的条件可以使用”。在这段文字中，它被用来比喻伍德罗·威尔逊在政治和外交上的有利局势。 +
具体来说，**这里的 "hand" 代表可利用的优势或策略，**而 "play" 意味着利用这些优势或策略来达成某种目标。因此，"had an even stronger hand to play" 意思是“拥有更强的优势或更有力的理由可以使用”。

外网在线辞典查到的解释: +

have a strong hand : +
1. In card games, to have been dealt a selection of cards that is quite likely to be better than those of other players. 在纸牌游戏中，所发的牌很可能比其他玩家的牌更好。 +

- I could tell from his eyes that *he had a strong hand*. Sure enough, he ended up with a royal flush at the end.
从他的眼神中我可以看出他得到了一副好牌。果然，最后他拿到了皇家同花。


2.By extension, to be in a position that affords (v.) one a lot of leverage 影响力，手段；杠杆力，杠杆作用 over others.
延伸的意思是: 处在一个很有利的位置上, 该位置使他能比别人有着更大的影响力。 +

- The country provides manufacturing opportunities for large companies around the globe, so *it has a strong hand* whenever new restrictions and regulations are proposed. +
该国为全球大公司提供制造机会，因此每当提出新的限制和法规时，该国都会发挥强有力的作用。
- Our union used (v.) to *have a strong hand* to negotiate with upper management, but they've been giving up our rights little by little over the years.
我们工会过去在与高层谈判时, 有很强的手段，但这些年来, 他们一直在一点一点地放弃我们的权利。

====

Still, the debate *lived on* 继续活着；继续存在. +
Two Senators and fifty Representatives voted against the war resolution, including the first female ever to sit in Congress, JEANNETTE RANKIN of Montana. +
Although a clear majority of Americans now supported the war effort, there were large segments of the populace who still needed convincing 使确信，使信服；说服，劝服.

[.my2]
尽管如此，争论仍在继续。两名参议员和五十名众议员投票反对这项战争决议，其中包括第一位进入国会的女性蒙大拿州的珍妮特·兰金。尽管现在绝大多数美国人支持战争努力，但仍有很大一部分民众需要说服。

[.my1]
.案例
====
chatpgpt: +
"ever to" 是一个固定表达，用来强调某件事情在历史上第一次发生。具体来说，这里的 "the first female ever to sit in Congress" 意思是“历史上第一位进入国会的女性”。"ever" 强调了这是第一次，具有前所未有的意义。

Conscription 征兵；征兵制度 was unavoidable, and Congress passed the SELECTIVE SERVICE ACT in May 1917.

[.my2]
第一个问题是, 筹集必要的军队数量。招募当然是首选方法，但仅仅靠志愿者并不能达到所需的数量。征兵是不可避免的，国会于 1917 年 5 月通过了《兵役法》。

[.my2]
1917 年，布尔什维克在一场国内革命中夺取了俄国政权，德国与俄国新政府签署了和平条约。于是, 德国人现在就有能力将许多在东线作战的士兵, 转移到陷入僵局的西线中去。因此, 如果没有美国军队的新补给，战争可能会走上一条截然不同结果的道路上去。

As the war drew to a close, Woodrow Wilson set forth his plan for a "JUST PEACE." Wilson believed that fundamental flaws in international relations created an unhealthy climate that led inexorably to the World War. +
His FOURTEEN POINTS outlined his vision for a safer world. +
Wilson called for an end to secret diplomacy, a reduction of armaments, and freedom of the seas. +
He claimed that reductions to trade barriers, fair adjustment of colonies, and respect for national self-determination would reduce economic and nationalist sentiments that lead to war. +
Finally, Wilson proposed an international organization comprising representatives of all the world's nations that would serve as a forum against allowing any conflict to escalate. +
Unfortunately, Wilson could not impose his world view on the victorious Allied Powers. +
When they met in Paris to hammer out the terms of the peace, the European leaders had other ideas.

.Thomas Woodrow Wilson 伍德罗·威尔逊

image:/img/Thomas Woodrow Wilson.jpg[,30%]

美国第28任总统 (1856年12月28日—1924年2月3日)，他的主张被后人称为"威尔逊主义"。

在战争的最后阶段，他发表"十四点和平原则"，从中阐述他所认为的能够避免世界再遭战火的新世界秩序。1919年赴巴黎筹建"国际联盟"以及拟定"凡尔赛条约"，并尤其关注自战败帝国中建立新国家的问题。

在与共和党控制的参议院围绕美国加入国联一事而进行激烈斗争时，因中风而昏倒。由于拒绝妥协，威尔逊最终未能使加入国联案在"参院"通过。尽管没有美国的加入，"国联"还是于1920年成立。

*威尔逊所秉持的国际主义，也被后人称为“威尔逊主义”，主张美国登上世界舞台来为民主而战斗，支持众小民族（如波兰）建立民族国家。这成为以后美国外交政策中一个颇有争议的理念，为理想主义者所效仿，却为现实主义者所排斥。*

十四点和平原则的要点：

- 无秘密外交。
- 航海自由。
- 消除国际贸易障碍。
- 限制军备。
- 平等对待殖民地人民。
- 奥匈帝国等的"民族自决"。
- 成立国际联盟以维持世界和平。


"十四点和平原则"具有开创性，它首次否认了大国之间扩张军力的合理性，并对"由国家之间的军事扩张而造成的不信任"进行了强烈的抨击。这对于当时富有侵略性的世界格局影响巨大；

同时，其学说对后世也产生了的重要的影响，*"联合国"实质上就是以威尔逊倡导的"国际联盟"为蓝本建立起来的。*

如果国家之间的联合与合作, 是建立在"利"益的基础上，*而"利益的摩擦"并没有一个组织通过一定的手段（包括经济的和政治的）来约束，那么"国际法"也就无法真正得到贯彻* -- 即国际社会仍然会处于"无政府状态"——国家之间必然会因产生不信任而导致分歧，**而此时的国际组织没有足够的力量去压制这种分歧，**这样的国际组织必然会产生分裂。

十四点和平原则难以达成，悬而未决的问题依旧存在，埋下了"第二次世界大战"爆发的导火线.

The Paris Peace Conference

[.my2]
巴黎和会

Most of the decisions made at the PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE were made by the BIG FOUR, consisting of President Wilson, DAVID LLOYD GEORGE of Great Britain, GEORGES CLEMENCEAU of France, and VITTORIO ORLANDO of Italy. +
The European leaders were not interested in a just peace. +
They were interested in retribution. +
Over Wilson's protests, they ignored the Fourteen Points one by one. +
Germany was to admit guilt for the war and pay unlimited reparations. +
The German military was reduced to a domestic police force and its territory was truncated to benefit the new nations of Eastern Europe. +
The territories of ALSACE AND LORRAINE were restored to France. +
German colonies were handed in trusteeship to the victorious Allies. +
No provisions were made to end secret diplomacy or preserve freedom of the seas. +
Wilson did gain approval for his proposal for a LEAGUE OF NATIONS. +
Dismayed by the overall results, but hopeful that a strong League could prevent future wars, he returned to present the TREATY OF VERSAILLES to the Senate.

[.my2]
**巴黎和平会议上, 做出的大部分决定, 都是由四巨头做出的，**即威尔逊总统、英国的戴维·劳埃德·乔治, 法国的乔治·克列孟梭, 和意大利的维托里奥·奥兰多。**欧洲领导人对公正的和平不感兴趣。他们对报复感兴趣。他们不顾威尔逊的抗议，一一无视十四点。**德国承认对战争有罪, 并支付无限的赔款。德国军队被缩减为国内警察部队，其领土也被缩减以让东欧新国家受益。阿尔萨斯和洛林的领土, 归还法国。**德国殖民地, 被交给胜利的同盟国托管。没有制定结束"秘密外交"或"维护海洋自由"的条款。威尔逊的"国际联盟"提案确实获得了批准。他对总体结果感到沮丧** ，但希望强大的联盟能够防止未来的战争，他返回美国, 并向参议院提交了《凡尔赛条约》。

Defeating the League of Nations

[.my2]
击败国际联盟

Unfortunately for Wilson, he was met with stiff opposition. +
The Republican leader of the Senate, HENRY CABOT LODGE, was very suspicious of Wilson and his treaty. +
ARTICLE X OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS required the United States to respect the territorial integrity of member states. +
Although there was no requirement compelling an American declaration of war, the United States might be bound to impose an economic embargo or to sever diplomatic relations. +
Lodge viewed the League as a supranational government that would limit the power of the American government from determining its own affairs. +
Others believed the League was the sort of entangling alliance the United States had avoided since GEORGE WASHINGTON'S FAREWELL ADDRESS. +
Lodge sabotaged the League covenant by declaring the United States exempt from Article X. +
He attached reservations, or amendments, to the treaty to this effect. +
Wilson, bedridden from a debilitating stroke, was unable to accept these changes. +
He asked Senate Democrats to vote against the Treaty of Versailles unless the Lodge reservations were dropped. +
Neither side budged, and the treaty went down to defeat.

[.my2]
**不幸的是，对于威尔逊来说，他遭到了强烈的反对。**参议院共和党领袖亨利·卡博特·洛奇, 对威尔逊和他的条约, 非常怀疑。国际联盟第十条要求, 美国尊重成员国的领土完整。尽管没有强制美国宣战的要求，但美国可能必须实施"经济禁运"或"断绝外交关系"。**洛奇认为, 联盟是一个超国家政府，它将限制美国政府决定其自身事务的权力。**其他人则认为，自乔治·华盛顿的告别演说以来，美国一直在避免建立"国联"这种纠缠不清的联盟。洛奇宣布美国不受第十条约束，从而破坏了"国联"盟约。他为此对条约提出了保留或修正案。威尔逊因中风卧床不起，无法接受这些变化。他要求"参议院"民主党人投票反对《凡尔赛条约》，除非洛奇的保留被放弃。双方都没有让步，条约最终宣告失败。

Why did the United States fail to ratify the Versailles Treaty and join the League of Nations? Personal enmity between Wilson and Lodge played a part. +
Wilson might have prudently invited a prominent Republican to accompany him to Paris to help ensure its later passage. +
Wilson's fading health eliminated the possibility of making a strong personal appeal on behalf of the treaty. +
Ethnic groups in the United States helped its defeat. +
German Americans felt their fatherland was being treated too harshly. +
Italian Americans felt more territory should have been awarded to Italy. +
Irish Americans criticized the treaty for failing to address the issue of Irish independence. +
Diehard American isolationists worried about a permanent global involvement. +
The stubborness of President Wilson led him to ask his own party to scuttle the treaty. +
The final results of all these factors had mammoth longterm consequences. +
Without the involvement of the world's newest superpower, the League of Nations was doomed to failure. +
Over the next two decades, the United States would sit on the sidelines as the unjust Treaty of Versailles and the ineffective League of Nations would set the stage for an even bloodier, more devastating clash.

[.my2]
美国为何未能批准《凡尔赛条约》, 并加入国际联盟？威尔逊和洛奇之间的个人恩怨, 起了一定作用。威尔逊可能会谨慎地邀请一位著名的共和党人, 陪同他前往巴黎，以帮助确保该法案随后获得通过。威尔逊的健康状况日益恶化，使他不可能代表条约提出强烈的个人呼吁。美国的少数民族群体, 也助力了其失败。德裔美国人认为, 他们的祖国受到了过于严厉的对待。意大利裔美国人认为, 应该将更多领土授予意大利。爱尔兰裔美国人, 批评该条约未能解决爱尔兰独立问题。顽固的美国孤立主义者, 担心永久被卷入全球。威尔逊总统的固执, 导致他要求自己的政党破坏该条约。所有这些因素的最终结果, 产生了巨大的长期影响。**如果没有世界最新超级大国的参与，国际联盟注定会失败。在接下来的二十年里，美国将袖手旁观，因为不公正的凡尔赛条约, 和无效的国际联盟, 将为一场更血腥、更具破坏性的冲突的发生, 奠定下了基础。(如同 联合国对中国没有控制力, 只会导致中国未来对台湾的吞并.)**

Yet for all its promise, prohibition was repealed fourteen years later, after being deemed a dismal failure.

Disadvantages to Prohibition

[.my2]
禁酒带来的缺点


While the number of drinkers may have decreased, the strength of the beverages increased. +
People drank as much as they could as fast as they could to avoid detection. +
Because alcoholic production was illegal, there could be no regulation. +
Desperate individuals and heartless profiteers distilled anything imaginable, often with disastrous results. +
Some alcohol sold on the black market caused nerve damage, blindness, and even death.

[.my2]
虽然饮酒者的数量可能减少了，但饮料的浓度却增加了。人们尽可能快地喝尽可能多的酒以避免被发现。由于酒精生产是非法的，因此无法进行监管。绝望的个人和无情的奸商会提炼出任何可以想象到的东西，往往会带来灾难性的结果。黑市上出售的一些酒精会导致神经损伤、失明，甚至死亡。



The Eighteenth Amendment was different from all previous changes to the Constitution. +
It was the first experiment at social engineering. +
Critics pointed out that it was the only amendment to date that restricted rather than increased individual rights. +
Civil liberties advocates considered prohibition an abomination. +
In the end, economics doomed prohibition. +
The costs of ineffectively policing the nation were simply too high. +
At the deepest point of the Great Depression, government officials finally ratified the TWENTY-FIRST AMENDMENT, repealing the practice once and for all.

第十八修正案不同于以往所有的宪法修改。这是社会工程学的第一个实验。批评者指出，这是迄今为止唯一"限制而不是增加个人权利"的修正案。公民自由倡导者认为, 禁令是令人憎恶的。最终，经济学注定了禁令的失败。国家治安不力的代价实在太高了。在大萧条最严重的时候，政府官员最终批准了第二十一条修正案，一劳永逸地废除了这种做法。

.Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution 美国宪法第十八修正案

是美国宪法历史上宣告"酒类酿造、运输和销售是违法的"一个修正案，实质上颁布了酒类饮料的禁制令。另外制定的沃尔斯泰德法, 则颁布了执行第十八修正案的细节，并定义何种“致醉”酒类饮料是被禁止的，以及何种是被排除于禁酒令外的，如药用, 或宗教仪式用酒类。

在修正案生效后，警察、法院、和监狱, 被"禁酒令"相关的新案件淹没；组织犯罪以倍数成长，收贿贪污在执法人员间快速的扩散。最后，第十八修正案于1933年第二十一修正案生效后被废除，是美国宪法至今唯一被废除的修正案。

宪法第十八修正案, 和沃尔斯泰德法, 一起开启了美国禁酒的历史。

- 禁酒令虽然阻止了人们在公共场合饮酒，却也滋生了私酿酒行业的兴起。
- 由于缺乏法律的监管，私酿酒的品质低下，影响了饮酒者的身体健康；
- 由于私酿酒利润率高昂，促使人们铤而走险参与酿酒活动，许多黑社会团体正是从酿酒、走私、贩卖酒水中获得了大量资金来源。
- 为了方便自己的酒水销售，它们又贿赂、勾结警察和政府官员，造成腐败滋生。

由于诸如此类的种种原因，禁酒运动开始受到人们的反对。

It was time for a cultural celebration. +
 African Americans had endured centuries of slavery and the struggle for abolition. +
 The end of bondage had not brought the promised land many had envisioned. +
 Instead, WHITE SUPREMACY was quickly, legally, and violently restored to the New South, where ninety percent of African Americans lived. +
 Starting in about 1890, African Americans migrated to the North in great numbers. +
 This GREAT MIGRATION eventually relocated hundreds of thousands of African Americans from the rural South to the urban North. +
 Many discovered they had shared common experiences in their past histories and their uncertain present circumstances. +
 Instead of wallowing in self-pity, the recently dispossessed ignited an explosion of cultural pride. +
 Indeed, African American culture was reborn in the HARLEM RENAISSANCE.

[.my2]
是时候进行文化庆祝了。非裔美国人忍受了几个世纪的奴隶制, 和争取废除奴隶制的斗争。奴役的结束, 并没有带来许多人所设想的应许之地。相反，白人至上主义迅速地、合法地和暴力地在新南方恢复，那里有90%的非洲裔美国人居住。大约从1890年开始，非裔美国人大量移民到北方。这次大迁徙, 最终将成千上万的非裔美国人, 从南方农村迁移到北方城市。许多人发现, 他们在过去的历史, 和当前不确定的环境中, 有着共同的经历。最近被剥夺财产的人, 没有沉湎于自怜之中，而是点燃了文化自豪感的爆发。事实上，非裔美国人文化, 在哈莱姆文艺复兴中获得了重生。

The Great Migration began because of a "push" and a "pull." Disenfranchisement and Jim Crow laws led many African Americans to hope for a new life up north. +
Hate groups and hate crimes cast alarm among African American families of the Deep South. +
The promise of owning land had not materialized. +
Most blacks toiled as sharecroppers trapped in an endless cycle of debt. +
In the 1890s, a boll weevil blight damaged the cotton crop throughout the region, increasing the despair. +
All these factors served to push African Americans to seek better lives. +
The booming northern economy forged the pull. +
Industrial jobs were numerous, and factory owners looked near and far for sources of cheap labor.

[.my2]
大迁徙是在“推”和“拉”的作用下开始的。剥夺公民权和种族隔离法, 导致许多非裔美国人希望在北方过上新生活。仇恨团体和仇恨犯罪, 给南方腹地的非裔美国家庭敲响了警钟。拥有土地的承诺并未实现。大多数黑人都以佃农的身份辛苦劳作，陷入无休止的债务循环之中。 1890 年代，棉铃象甲枯萎病, 损害了整个地区的棉花作物，加剧了人们的绝望。所有这些因素, 都促使非裔美国人迁移去寻求更好的生活。蓬勃发展的北方经济形成了拉力。工业工作岗位数量众多，工厂主四处寻找廉价劳动力来源。


Unfortunately, northerners did not welcome African Americans with open arms. +
While the legal systems of the northern states were not as obstructionist toward African American rights, the prejudice among the populace was as acrimonious. +
White laborers complained that African Americans were flooding the employment market and lowering wages. +
Most new migrants found themselves segregated by practice in run down urban slums. +
The largest of these was Harlem. +
Writers, actors, artists, and musicians glorified African American traditions, and at the same time created new ones.

[.my2]
不幸的是，北方人并没有张开双臂欢迎非洲裔美国人。虽然北部各州的法律制度, 并不那么阻碍非裔美国人的权利，但民众的偏见却同样激烈。白人劳工抱怨非裔美国人涌入就业市场, 并降低了工资。大多数新移民发现, 自己被隔离在破败的城市贫民窟里。其中最大的是哈林区。作家、演员、艺术家和音乐家, 颂扬非裔美国人的传统，同时创造新的传统。

很多批判家指出，哈莱姆文艺复兴企图创立一个新的，与白人文化、欧洲文化从根本上完全分离的文化.

==== Domestic and International Politics 国内和国际政治

Despite all the verve of the American social scene in the 1920s, the Presidential leadership of the decade was quite unremarkable.

[.my2]
*尽管 20 年代美国社会风光无限，但这十年的总统领导却相当平淡。*

On the international scene, two themes dominated American diplomacy. +
The first was to take steps to avoid the mistakes that led to World War I. +
To this end, President Harding convened the WASHINGTON NAVAL ARMS CONFERENCE in 1921. +
The United States, Great Britain, and Japan agreed to a ten-year freeze on the construction of battleships and to maintain a capital ship ratio of 5:5:3. +
They also agreed to uphold the OPEN DOOR POLICY and to respect each other's holdings in the Pacific. +
In 1928, the United States and France led an initiative called the KELLOGG-BRIAND PACT, in which 62 nations agreed to outlaw war. +
These two measures showed the degree to which Americans hoped to forestall another disastrous war. +
The second priority dealt with outstanding international debt. +
While practicing political isolation, the United States was completely entangled with Europe economically. +
The Allies owed the United States an enormous sum of money from World War I. +
Lacking the resources to reimburse America, the Allies relied on German reparations. +
The German economy was so debased by the Treaty of Versailles provisions that they relied on loans from American banks for support. +
In essence, American banks were funding the repayment of the foreign debt. +
As Germany slipped further and further into depression, the United States intervened again. +
The DAWES PLAN allowed Germany to extend their payments on more generous terms. +
In the end, when the GREAT DEPRESSION struck, only Finland was able to make good on its debt to the United States.

[.my2]
在国际舞台上，两个主题主导着美国外交。首先是采取措施, 避免重蹈导致第一次世界大战的错误。为此，哈定总统于 1921 年召开了华盛顿海军武器会议。美国、英国和日本同意, 将武器冻结十年。建造战列舰并保持主力舰比例为5:5:3。他们还同意坚持"门户开放"政策, 并尊重彼此在太平洋地区的资产。 1928 年，美国和法国发起了一项名为《凯洛格-布里安条约》的倡议，其中 62 个国家同意禁止战争。这两项措施显示了美国人希望阻止另一场灾难性战争的程度。 +
第二个优先事项涉及"未偿国际债务"。美国在实行政治孤立的同时，在经济上与欧洲完全纠缠在一起。第一次世界大战期间，协约国欠美国巨额资金。**由于缺乏偿还美国的资源，协约国只能依靠德国的赔款。**德国经济因《凡尔赛条约》的规定而严重受损，以至于他们依赖美国银行的贷款来支持。实质上，美国银行正在为偿还外债提供资金。**当德国越来越陷入萧条时，美国再次进行干预。** DAWES 计划允许德国以更慷慨的条件延长付款期限。*最终，当大萧条袭来时，只有芬兰能够偿还欠美国的债务。*

.Kellogg–Briand Pact 关于废弃战争作为国家政策工具的普遍公约. +
亦称《巴黎非战公约》 Pact of Paris.

是1928年8月27日在巴黎签署一项国际公约，该公约规定, 放弃"以战争作为国家政策的手段", 和只能"以和平方法解决国际争端"，虽然在条约签署后在第二次义衣战争、第二次世界大战等大型战争中, 公约并没有起到遏止效果，但是该项公约是人类第一次放弃"战争作为国家的外交政策"。

公约内容:

- 各缔约国, 以各自人民的名义庄严宣告，各国谴责为解决国际争端而诉诸战争，并**废弃"战争"作为各国彼此关系中的国家政策工具。**
- 各缔约国同意，各国之间若发生任何性质或起因的争端或冲突，*只能以"和平方式"加以处理或解决。*

.Dawes Plan 道威斯计划
在1923年由美国提出，用以舒缓德国因"凡尔赛条约"赔款, 而承受的巨大财政压力。1919年，第一次世界大战结束。盟军要求德国按照条约赔偿66亿英镑，令德国经济严重衰退。1923年，由于德国未能及时赔偿，法国军队与比利时军队占领德国西部工业重镇、盛产煤及钢铁的鲁尔区。这不但令德国人民震怒，而且还增加其经济负担。

为了解决困局和让德国继续赔偿，盟军赔款委员会, 任命美国行政管理和预算局局长查尔斯·盖茨·道威斯, 主持计划，希望寻求让各方同意的方案。*德国会得到主要来自美国的外国贷款.*

虽然德国经济复苏，能够迅速赔款，但不久后又见困乏，难以长久维持赔偿。结果，美国在1929年改用"扬计划"来帮助德国。

.Young Plan 扬格计划
是由美国实业家、商人、律师及外交官欧文·D·扬（Owen D. +
Young）提出的计划，借以协助德国在第一次世界大战后偿还赔款。

赔款分为两部分：三分之一是“无条件赔款”；其余是可延期赔款：可由"交通税"或"财政预算"中抽出款项。为了让赔款过程顺利，盟国成立了"国际结算银行"处理赔款。

**但是，在计划实行之前，1929年的经济大萧条造成大量问题：美资银行急需从欧洲取回现金，**加上贸易衰退，造成不少阻力；经济衰退导致经济民族主义，阻碍贸易复苏；德国失业率持续高企，1931年时是33.7%，1932年则是40%。

多国代表明白，大萧条已令德国无法再继续付还赔款，所以他们同意：

- 不再压迫德国马上赔款；
- **免除德国九成债项，**并要她发债券 -- 这如同不用她赔偿，因为赔款由原本的 330亿, 减至 7.14亿美元。
- 代表也通过非正式协定：**只要美国减免盟军所有战争债款，以上条款才会生效，**因为胡佛认为，延期偿付权根本与债款无关。延期偿付权届满后，德国仍要按"杨格计划"的规定赔款。

但以上计划最后都全数失败：*德国一直没有再继续赔偿，纳粹党上台以后，他们更不承认任何赔款。*

=== America in the First World War


Isolation was a long American tradition. Since the days of George Washington, Americans struggled to remain protected by the mighty oceans on its border. When European conflicts erupted, as they frequently did, many in the United States claimed exceptionalism. America was different. Why get involved in Europe's self-destruction? When the ARCHDUKE OF AUSTRIA-HUNGARY was killed in cold blood, igniting the most destructive war in human history, the initial reaction in the United States was the expected will for neutrality. As a nation of immigrants, The United States would have difficulty picking a side. Despite the obvious ties to Britain based on history and language, there were many United States citizens who claimed Germany and Austria-Hungary as their parent lands. Support of either the ALLIES or the CENTRAL POWERS might prove divisive.

In the early days of the war, as Britain and France struggled against Germany, American leaders decided it was in the national interest to continue trade with all sides as before. A neutral nation cannot impose an embargo on one side and continue trade with the other and retain its neutral status. In addition, United States merchants and manufacturers feared that a boycott would cripple the American economy. Great Britain, with its powerful navy, had different ideas. A major part of the British strategy was to impose a blockade on Germany. American trade with the Central Powers simply could not be permitted. The results of the blockade were astonishing. Trade with England and France more than tripled between 1914 and 1916, while trade with Germany was cut by over ninety percent. It was this situation that prompted submarine warfare by the Germans against Americans at sea. After two and a half years of isolationism, America entered the Great War.


The contributions of the United States military to the Allied effort were decisive. Since the Russians decided to quit the war, the Germans were able to move many of their troops from the eastern front to the stalemate in the West. The seemingly infinite supply of fresh American soldiers countered this potential advantage and was demoralizing to the Germans. American soldiers entered the bloody trenches and by November 1918, the war was over. Contributions to the war effort were not confined to the battlefield. The entire American economy was mobilized to win the war. From planting extra vegetables to keeping the furnace turned off, American civilians provided extra food and fuel to the war effort. The United States government engaged in a massive propaganda campaign to raise troops and money. Where dissent was apparent, it was stifled, prompting many to question whether American civil liberties were in jeopardy. In the end, the war was won, but the peace was lost. The Treaty of Versailles as presented by President Wilson was rejected by the Senate. Two dangerous decades of political isolationism followed, only to end in an ever more cataclysmic war.


'''

==== Farewell to Isolation



With American trade becoming more and more lopsided toward the Allied cause, many feared that it was only a matter of time before the United States would be at war. The issue that propelled most American fencesitters to side with the British was German submarine warfare.

The British, with the world's largest navy, had effectively shut down German maritime trade. Because there was no hope of catching the British in numbers of ships, the Germans felt that the SUBMARINE was their only key to survival. One "U-BOAT" could surreptitiously sink many battleships, only to slip away unseen. This practice would stop only if the British would lift their blockade.



The isolationist American public had little concern if the British and Germans tangled on the high seas. The incident that changed everything was the sinking of the LUSITANIA. The Germans felt they had done their part to warn Americans about the danger of overseas travel.

The German government purchased advertisement space in American newspapers warning that Americans who traveled on ships carrying war contraband risked submarine attack. When the Lusitania departed New York, the Germans believed the massive passenger ship was loaded with munitions in its cargo hold. On May 7, 1915, a German U-boat torpedoed the ship without warning, sending 1,198 passengers, including 128 Americans, to an icy grave. The Lusitania, as it turned out, was carrying over 4 million rounds of ammunition.


The sinking of the British ship RMS Lusitania in 1915, helped move American public opinion away from neutrality. Nearly 1200 civilians lost their lives in the German torpedo attack, 10% of them American

President Wilson was enraged. The British were breaking the rules, but the Germans were causing deaths.

Wilson's Secretary of State, William Jennings Bryan, recommended a ban on American travel on any ships of nations at war. Wilson preferred a tougher line against the German Kaiser. He demanded an immediate end to submarine warfare, prompting Bryan to resign in protest. The Germans began a 2-year practice of pledging to cease submarine attacks, reneging on that pledge, and issuing it again under U.S. protest.

Wilson had other reasons for leaning toward the Allied side. He greatly admired the British government, and democracy in any form was preferable to German authoritarianism. The historical ties with Britain seemed to draw the United States closer to that side.

Many Americans felt a debt to France for their help in the American Revolution. Several hundred volunteers, appropriately named the LAFAYETTE ESCADRILLES, already volunteered to fight with the French in 1916. In November of that year, Wilson campaigned for re-election with a peace platform. "He kept us out of war," read his campaign signs, and Americans narrowly returned him to the White House. But peace was not to be.



In February 1917, citing the unbalanced U.S. trade with the Allies, Germany announced a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare. All vessels spotted in the war zone would be sunk immediately and without warning. Wilson responded by severing diplomatic relations with the German government.

Later that month, British intelligence intercepted the notorious ZIMMERMANN TELEGRAM. The German foreign minister sent a message courting support from Mexico in the event the United States should enter the war. Zimmermann promised Mexico a return of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona — territories it had lost in 1848.



War Declared on Germany

A tempest of outrage followed. More and more Americans began to label Germany as the true villain in the war. When German subs sank several American commercial ships in March, Wilson had an even stronger hand to play. On April 2, 1917, he addressed the Congress, citing a long list of grievances against Germany. Four days later, by a wide margin in each house, Congress declared war on Germany, and the U.S. was plunged into the bloodiest battle in history.

Still, the debate lived on. Two Senators and fifty Representatives voted against the war resolution, including the first female ever to sit in Congress, JEANNETTE RANKIN of Montana. Although a clear majority of Americans now supported the war effort, there were large segments of the populace who still needed convincing.

'''

==== Over There 在那边 (美国士兵在欧洲土地上的参战)


United States Army


The United States was developing a nasty pattern of entering major conflicts woefully unprepared.

When Congress declared war in April 1917, the army had enough bullets for only two days of fighting. The army was small in numbers at only 200,000 soldiers. Two-fifths of these men were members of the NATIONAL GUARD, which had only recently been federalized. The type of warfare currently plaguing Europe was unlike any the world had ever seen.

The Western front, which ran through Belgium and France, was a virtual stalemate since the early years of the war. A system of trenches had been dug by each side. Machine-gun nests, barbed wire, and mines blocked the opposing side from capturing the enemy trench. Artillery shells, mortars, flamethrowers, and poison gas were employed to no avail.

The defensive technology was simply better than the offensive technology. Even if an enemy trench was captured, the enemy would simply retreat into another dug fifty yards behind. Each side would repeatedly send their soldiers "over the top" of the trenches into the no man's land of almost certain death with very little territorial gain. Now young American men would be sent to these killing fields.


The first problem was raising the necessary number of troops. Recruitment was of course the preferred method, but the needed numbers could not be reached simply with volunteers. Conscription was unavoidable, and Congress passed the SELECTIVE SERVICE ACT in May 1917.

All males between the ages of 21 and 30 were required to register for military service. The last time a DRAFT had been used resulted in great rioting because of the ability of the wealthy to purchase exemptions. This time, the draft was conducted by random lottery.

By the end of the war, over four and a half million American men, and 11,000 American women, served in the armed forces. 400,000 African Americans were called to active duty. In all, two million Americans fought in the French TRENCHES.

The first military measures adopted by the United States were on the seas. Joint Anglo-American operations were highly successful at stopping the dreaded submarine. Following the thinking that there is greater strength in numbers, the U.S. and Britain developed an elaborate convoy system to protect vulnerable ships. In addition, mines were placed in many areas formerly dominated by German U-boats. The campaign was so effective that not a single American soldier was lost on the high seas in transit to the Western front.

The AMERICAN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE began arriving in France in June 1917, but the original numbers were quite small. Time was necessary to inflate the ranks of the United States Army and to provide at least a rudimentary training program. The timing was critical.

When the Bolsheviks took over Russia in 1917 in a domestic revolution, Germany signed a peace treaty with the new government. The Germans could now afford to transfer many of their soldiers fighting in the East to the deadlocked Western front. Were it not for the fresh supply of incoming American troops, the war might have followed a very different path.

The addition of the United States to the Allied effort was as elevating to the Allied morale as it was devastating to the German will. Refusing to submit to the overall Allied commander, GENERAL JOHN PERSHING retained independent American control over the U.S. troops.

Paris: Ooh, La La

The new soldiers began arriving in great numbers in early 1918. The "DOUGHBOYS," as they were labeled by the French were green indeed. Many fell prey to the trappings of Paris nightlife while awaiting transfer to the front. An estimated fifteen percent of American troops in France contracted venereal disease from Parisian prostitutes, costing millions of dollars in treatment.


The African American soldiers noted that their treatment by the French soldiers was better than their treatment by their white counterparts in the American army. Although the German army dropped tempting leaflets on the African American troops promising a less-racist society if the Germans would win, none took the offer seriously.



on November 11, 1918, the German government agreed to an armistice. The war was over. Over 14 million soldiers and civilians perished in the so-called GREAT WAR, including 112,000 Americans. Countless more were wounded.

The bitterness that swept Europe and America would prevent the securing of a just peace, imperiling the next generation as well.

'''

==== Over Here 在这里 (美国本土的战争动员)

Library of Congress

Originally designed as a magazine cover, James Montgomery Flagg's image of Uncle Sam soon became the "most famous poster in the world," with 4 million copies printed in 1917 alone.



The First World War was a total war. In previous wars, the civilian population tried to steer clear of the war effort. Surely expectations were placed on civilians for food and clothing, and of course, since the 19th century, troops were conscripted from the general population. But modern communication and warfare required an all-out effort from the entire population. New weapons technology required excess fuel and industrial capacity. The economic costs of 20th century warfare dwarfed earlier wars, therefore extensive revenue raising was essential. Without the support of the whole population, failure was certain. Governments used every new communications technology imaginable to spread pro-war propaganda. American efforts geared to winning World War I amounted to nothing less than a national machine.

Rallying the Country

Once Congress declared war, President Wilson quickly created the COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC INFORMATION under the direction of GEORGE CREEL. Creel used every possible medium imaginable to raise American consciousness. Creel organized rallies and parades. He commissioned GEORGE M. COHAN to write patriotic songs intended to stoke the fires of American nationalism. Indeed, "OVER THERE" became an overnight standard. JAMES MONTGOMERY FLAGG illustrated dozens of posters urging Americans to do everything from preserving coal to enlisting in the service. Flagg depicted a serious UNCLE SAM staring at young American men declaring "I Want You for the U.S. Army." His powerful images were hard to resist. An army of "FOUR-MINUTE MEN" swept the nation making short, but poignant, powerful speeches. Films and plays added to the fervor. The CREEL COMMITTEE effectively raised national spirit and engaged millions of Americans in the business of winning the war.


Dealing With Dissenters

Still there were dissenters. The American Socialist Party condemned the war effort. Irish-Americans often displayed contempt for the British ally. Millions of immigrants from Germany and Austria-Hungary were forced to support initiatives that could destroy their homelands. But this dissent was rather small. Nevertheless, the government stifled wartime opposition by law with the passing of the ESPIONAGE AND SEDITION ACTS OF 1917. Anyone found guilty of criticizing the government war policy or hindering wartime directives could be sent to jail. Many cried that this was a flagrant violation of precious civil liberties, including the right to free speech. The Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision on this issue in the SCHENCK V. UNITED STATES verdict. The majority court opinion ruled that should an individual's free speech present a "clear and present danger" to others, the government could impose restrictions or penalties. Schenck was arrested for sabotaging the draft. The Court ruled that his behavior endangered thousands of American lives and upheld his jail sentence. Socialist Party leader Eugene V. Debs was imprisoned and ran for President from his jail cell in 1920. He polled nearly a million votes.


There was a sinister side to the war hysteria. Many Americans could not discern between enemies abroad and enemies at home. German-Americans became targets for countless HATE CRIMES.


Once support for the war was in full swing, the population was mobilized to produce war materiel. In 1917, the WAR INDUSTRIES BOARD was established to coordinate production of munitions and supplies. The board was empowered to allocate raw materials and determine what products would be given high priority. Women shifted jobs from domestic service to heavy industry to compensate for the labor shortage owing to military service. African Americans flocked northward in greater and greater numbers in the hope of winning industry jobs. Herbert Hoover was appointed to head the FOOD ADMINISTRATION. Shortages of food in the Allied countries had led to shortages and rationing all across Western Europe. Hoover decided upon a plan that would raise the necessary foodstuffs by voluntary means. Americans were encouraged to participate in "MEATLESS MONDAYS" and "WHEATLESS WEDNESDAYS." Additional food could be raised by planting "VICTORY GARDENS" in small backyard patches or even in window boxes on fire escapes. President Wilson showed his support by allowing a flock of sheep to graze on the White House lawn. Similar measures were employed by the Fuel Administration. The government also adopted DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME to conserve energy.

World War I was the most expensive endeavor by the United States up to that point in history. The total cost to the American public amounted to over $110 billion. Five successful LIBERTY BOND DRIVES raised about two-thirds of that sum. Of course, bonds are loans to be paid by future generations. The first INCOME TAX under the Sixteenth Amendment was levied. The tax rate at the top level was 70%. All in all, great sacrifices were made on behalf of the United States people in their venture to make the world safe for democracy.

==== The Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations



As the war drew to a close, Woodrow Wilson set forth his plan for a "JUST PEACE." Wilson believed that fundamental flaws in international relations created an unhealthy climate that led inexorably to the World War. His FOURTEEN POINTS outlined his vision for a safer world. Wilson called for an end to secret diplomacy, a reduction of armaments, and freedom of the seas. He claimed that reductions to trade barriers, fair adjustment of colonies, and respect for national self-determination would reduce economic and nationalist sentiments that lead to war. Finally, Wilson proposed an international organization comprising representatives of all the world's nations that would serve as a forum against allowing any conflict to escalate. Unfortunately, Wilson could not impose his world view on the victorious Allied Powers. When they met in Paris to hammer out the terms of the peace, the European leaders had other ideas.



The Paris Peace Conference

Most of the decisions made at the PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE were made by the BIG FOUR, consisting of President Wilson, DAVID LLOYD GEORGE of Great Britain, GEORGES CLEMENCEAU of France, and VITTORIO ORLANDO of Italy. The European leaders were not interested in a just peace. They were interested in retribution. Over Wilson's protests, they ignored the Fourteen Points one by one. Germany was to admit guilt for the war and pay unlimited reparations. The German military was reduced to a domestic police force and its territory was truncated to benefit the new nations of Eastern Europe. The territories of ALSACE AND LORRAINE were restored to France. German colonies were handed in trusteeship to the victorious Allies. No provisions were made to end secret diplomacy or preserve freedom of the seas. Wilson did gain approval for his proposal for a LEAGUE OF NATIONS. Dismayed by the overall results, but hopeful that a strong League could prevent future wars, he returned to present the TREATY OF VERSAILLES to the Senate.

Defeating the League of Nations

Unfortunately for Wilson, he was met with stiff opposition. The Republican leader of the Senate, HENRY CABOT LODGE, was very suspicious of Wilson and his treaty. ARTICLE X OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS required the United States to respect the territorial integrity of member states. Although there was no requirement compelling an American declaration of war, the United States might be bound to impose an economic embargo or to sever diplomatic relations. Lodge viewed the League as a supranational government that would limit the power of the American government from determining its own affairs. Others believed the League was the sort of entangling alliance the United States had avoided since GEORGE WASHINGTON'S FAREWELL ADDRESS. Lodge sabotaged the League covenant by declaring the United States exempt from Article X. He attached reservations, or amendments, to the treaty to this effect. Wilson, bedridden from a debilitating stroke, was unable to accept these changes. He asked Senate Democrats to vote against the Treaty of Versailles unless the Lodge reservations were dropped. Neither side budged, and the treaty went down to defeat.

Why did the United States fail to ratify the Versailles Treaty and join the League of Nations? Personal enmity between Wilson and Lodge played a part. Wilson might have prudently invited a prominent Republican to accompany him to Paris to help ensure its later passage. Wilson's fading health eliminated the possibility of making a strong personal appeal on behalf of the treaty. Ethnic groups in the United States helped its defeat. German Americans felt their fatherland was being treated too harshly. Italian Americans felt more territory should have been awarded to Italy. Irish Americans criticized the treaty for failing to address the issue of Irish independence. Diehard American isolationists worried about a permanent global involvement. The stubborness of President Wilson led him to ask his own party to scuttle the treaty. The final results of all these factors had mammoth longterm consequences. Without the involvement of the world's newest superpower, the League of Nations was doomed to failure. Over the next two decades, the United States would sit on the sidelines as the unjust Treaty of Versailles and the ineffective League of Nations would set the stage for an even bloodier, more devastating clash.

=== The Decade That Roared

The 1920s saw the culmination of fifty years of rapid American industrialization. The standard of living increased as the economy grew stronger and stronger. The results were spectacular. The America of 1929 was vastly different from the America of 1919.

Perhaps no invention affected American everyday life in the 20th century more than the automobile.

Although the technology for the AUTOMOBILE existed in the 19th century, it took HENRY FORD to make the useful gadget accessible to the American public.


==== 禁酒令的失败

When the states ratified the EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENT in 1919, the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages was outlawed. Yet for all its promise, prohibition was repealed fourteen years later, after being deemed a dismal failure.


Disadvantages to Prohibition


While the number of drinkers may have decreased, the strength of the beverages increased. People drank as much as they could as fast as they could to avoid detection. Because alcoholic production was illegal, there could be no regulation. Desperate individuals and heartless profiteers distilled anything imaginable, often with disastrous results. Some alcohol sold on the black market caused nerve damage, blindness, and even death.



The Eighteenth Amendment was different from all previous changes to the Constitution. It was the first experiment at social engineering. Critics pointed out that it was the only amendment to date that restricted rather than increased individual rights. Civil liberties advocates considered prohibition an abomination. In the end, economics doomed prohibition. The costs of ineffectively policing the nation were simply too high. At the deepest point of the Great Depression, government officials finally ratified the TWENTY-FIRST AMENDMENT, repealing the practice once and for all.

It was time for a cultural celebration.  African Americans had endured centuries of slavery and the struggle for abolition.  The end of bondage had not brought the promised land many had envisioned.  Instead, WHITE SUPREMACY was quickly, legally, and violently restored to the New South, where ninety percent of African Americans lived.  Starting in about 1890, African Americans migrated to the North in great numbers.  This GREAT MIGRATION eventually relocated hundreds of thousands of African Americans from the rural South to the urban North.  Many discovered they had shared common experiences in their past histories and their uncertain present circumstances.  Instead of wallowing in self-pity, the recently dispossessed ignited an explosion of cultural pride.  Indeed, African American culture was reborn in the HARLEM RENAISSANCE.

The Great Migration began because of a "push" and a "pull." Disenfranchisement and Jim Crow laws led many African Americans to hope for a new life up north. Hate groups and hate crimes cast alarm among African American families of the Deep South. The promise of owning land had not materialized. Most blacks toiled as sharecroppers trapped in an endless cycle of debt. In the 1890s, a boll weevil blight damaged the cotton crop throughout the region, increasing the despair. All these factors served to push African Americans to seek better lives. The booming northern economy forged the pull. Industrial jobs were numerous, and factory owners looked near and far for sources of cheap labor.



Unfortunately, northerners did not welcome African Americans with open arms. While the legal systems of the northern states were not as obstructionist toward African American rights, the prejudice among the populace was as acrimonious. White laborers complained that African Americans were flooding the employment market and lowering wages. Most new migrants found themselves segregated by practice in run down urban slums. The largest of these was Harlem. Writers, actors, artists, and musicians glorified African American traditions, and at the same time created new ones.

==== Domestic and International Politics

Despite all the verve of the American social scene in the 1920s, the Presidential leadership of the decade was quite unremarkable.

On the international scene, two themes dominated American diplomacy. The first was to take steps to avoid the mistakes that led to World War I. To this end, President Harding convened the WASHINGTON NAVAL ARMS CONFERENCE in 1921. The United States, Great Britain, and Japan agreed to a ten-year freeze on the construction of battleships and to maintain a capital ship ratio of 5:5:3. They also agreed to uphold the OPEN DOOR POLICY and to respect each other's holdings in the Pacific. In 1928, the United States and France led an initiative called the KELLOGG-BRIAND PACT, in which 62 nations agreed to outlaw war. These two measures showed the degree to which Americans hoped to forestall another disastrous war. The second priority dealt with outstanding international debt. While practicing political isolation, the United States was completely entangled with Europe economically. The Allies owed the United States an enormous sum of money from World War I. Lacking the resources to reimburse America, the Allies relied on German reparations. The German economy was so debased by the Treaty of Versailles provisions that they relied on loans from American banks for support. In essence, American banks were funding the repayment of the foreign debt. As Germany slipped further and further into depression, the United States intervened again. The DAWES PLAN allowed Germany to extend their payments on more generous terms. In the end, when the GREAT DEPRESSION struck, only Finland was able to make good on its debt to the United States.
