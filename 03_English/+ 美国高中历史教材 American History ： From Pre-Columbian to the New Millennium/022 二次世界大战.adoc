=== America in the Second World War 第二次世界大战中的美国

For the second time in the 20th century, the United States became involved in a devastating (a.)破坏性极大的；毁灭性的 world conflict.

[.my2]
美国在20世纪, 第二次卷入毁灭性的世界冲突。

The mobilization 动员；调动 effort of the government in WORLD WAR II eclipsed  (v.)遮住…的光;使失色；使相形见绌；使丧失重要性 even that of World War I. +
With major operations 大手术,大规模作战  in both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters, American industries literally 按照字面意义地，（强调事实可能令人惊讶）真正地，确实地 fueled (v.)  two wars simultaneously 同时地. +
The social and economic consequences were profound （影响）深刻的，极大的. +

The GREAT MIGRATION OF AFRICAN AMERICANS from the rural South to the industrial North `系` was accelerated  加速的；加快的.  +
New opportunities opened for women. +
Americans finally enjoyed a standard of living (n.) higher than the pre-Depression years.

[.my2]
**政府在第二次世界大战中的动员力度, 甚至超过了第一次世界大战。**美国工业在大西洋和太平洋战区, 都有重要行动，实际上同时助长了两场战争。**社会和经济后果是深远的。**非裔美国人从南方农村向北方工业大迁徙的速度加快。*为女性带来了新的机遇。美国人终于享受到了比大萧条前更高的生活水平。*

[.my1]
.案例
====
.eclipse
-> ec-, 向外。-lipse, 留下，词源同 leave, ellipse. 即留下一块阴影的。
====

But the war effort also had a darker side. +
Civil liberties were compromised (v.)（为达成协议而）妥协，折中，让步;违背（原则）；达不到（标准）, particularly for the 110,000 Japanese Americans who were forcibly (ad.)用强力；用武力 uprooted (v.)将…连根拔起;（使）离开家园（或熟悉的地方等） from their West Coast homes to be sent to remote relocation camps.

[.my2]
**但战争努力, 也有阴暗的一面。公民自由受到损害，**尤其是 110,000 名日裔美国人，他们被强行从西海岸的家园连根拔起，送往偏远的安置营。



In both Europe and Asia, the Axis powers had established a firm foothold （可以此发展或取得成功的）稳固地位，立足点 *prior to* American entry (n.) into the conflict. +
Slowly, but surely the Allies closed the ring on Nazi Germany after turning points 转折点 at El Alamein and STALINGRAD 斯大林格勒. +
Once Italy quit the Axis and the Allies landed successfully at NORMANDY, it was only a matter of time before the Nazi machine was smashed. +

Similar failures marked the early war in the Pacific, as the Japanese captured the Philippines. +
But once Japanese offensive capabilities were damaged at Midway, the United States "ISLAND HOPPED (v.)跳跃" its way to the Japanese mainland.

[.my2]
在欧洲和亚洲，轴心国在美国介入冲突之前, 就已经站稳了脚跟。在阿拉曼和斯大林格勒的转折点之后，盟军缓慢但坚定地关闭上了对纳粹德国的包围圈。一旦意大利退出轴心国、盟军成功登陆诺曼底，纳粹机器被粉碎只是时间问题。类似的失败也出现在太平洋战争初期，当时日本占领了菲律宾。但一旦日本的进攻能力在中途岛遭到破坏，美国就“跳岛”前往日本本土。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.El Alamein
阿拉曼战役.
是第二次世界大战中"北非战场"的转折点。这次战役从1942年10月23日一直持续到11月3日。**盟军在阿拉曼的胜利, 致使意大利和德国欲占领埃及、控制苏伊士运河, 及中东油田的希望破灭。**这次战役结束了非洲装甲集团军的攻势，**此场战役后, 轴心国于北非战场转入战略撤退。**

*"阿拉曼战役"与同时期的"斯大林格勒战役"与"瓜达康纳尔战役", 成为同盟国进入"战略反攻阶段"的开始。*

.Suez Canal 苏伊士运河

image:/img/Suez Canal 1.png[,70%]

image:/img/Suez Canal 2.png[,45%]

image:/img/Suez Canal 4.png[,100%]

全长约164公里. +
这条运河连结了欧洲与亚洲之间的南北双向水运，船只不必绕过非洲南端的"好望角"，大大节省航程。

运河当前由埃及的苏伊士运河管理局拥有和管理。*由于位置极具战略价值，根据君士坦丁堡公约，“运河在战时也可像和平时期一样，任何商用及军用船只均可使用，而无需悬挂区别旗帜。”*

法兰西第二殖民帝国, 因为美洲的殖民地被英国所夺，所以重点向东方发展。打通"苏伊士运河"对法国意义更为重大。运河于1869年11月17日通航。

[.my2]
战争期间也出现了新技术。"雷达"帮助英国定位来袭的德国飞机，"声纳"使潜艇探测变得更加可行。德国 V-1 和 V-2 火箭弹, 开创了远程战争的新时代。但没有任何一种武器的破坏力可以与原子弹相比，原子弹是在美国政府牵头的大规模秘密研究项目后开发出来的。

在所有被囚禁的日裔美国人中，62％是美国公民。直到二战结束, 美国才陆续解散了这些集中营。

**为了避免日裔美国人擅自离开禁区，美国政府禁止他们自银行账户中提款。日裔美国人被给予48小时离开集中营收拾简单的行李。**他们只被允许带一个包, 且不能携带收音机或相机。

**这些拘留营位于各州最贫瘠、荒芜的土地上，四周围着铁丝网和瞭望塔，**从外观上看，与德国纳粹的集中营并无二致，罗斯福总统都不止一次地把它们称为“集中营”。在拘留营内，**分配给一个6口或7口之家的住房只有30平方米，房间里没有独立的煤气炉和自来水，数个家庭共用一个洗衣间、一个餐厅和一个厕所。露天的淋浴间也是数个家庭共用的，瞭望塔上的哨兵可以清楚地看到在淋浴间里洗澡的人。**

=== America in the Second World War

For the second time in the 20th century, the United States became involved in a devastating world conflict.

The mobilization effort of the government in WORLD WAR II eclipsed even that of World War I. With major operations in both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters, American industries literally fueled two wars simultaneously. The social and economic consequences were profound. The GREAT MIGRATION OF AFRICAN AMERICANS from the rural South to the industrial North was accelerated. New opportunities opened for women. Americans finally enjoyed a standard of living higher than the pre-Depression years.

But the war effort also had a darker side. Civil liberties were compromised, particularly for the 110,000 Japanese Americans who were forcibly uprooted from their West Coast homes to be sent to remote relocation camps.



In both Europe and Asia, the Axis powers had established a firm foothold prior to American entry into the conflict. Slowly, but surely the Allies closed the ring on Nazi Germany after turning points at El Alamein and STALINGRAD. Once Italy quit the Axis and the Allies landed successfully at NORMANDY, it was only a matter of time before the Nazi machine was smashed. Similar failures marked the early war in the Pacific, as the Japanese captured the Philippines. But once Japanese offensive capabilities were damaged at Midway, the United States "ISLAND HOPPED" its way to the Japanese mainland.



New technologies emerged during the war as well. RADAR helped the British locate incoming German planes, and SONAR made SUBMARINE detection much more feasible. GERMAN V-1 AND V-2 ROCKETS ushered in a new age of long-range warfare. But no weapon compared in destructive capacity to the atomic bomb, developed after a massive, secret research project spearheaded by the United States government.

World War II was fought over differences left unresolved after World War I. Over 400,000 Americans perished in the four years of involvement, an American death rate second only to the Civil War. Twelve million victims perished from Nazi atrocities in the HOLOCAUST. The deaths of twenty million Russians created a defensive Soviet mindset that spilled into the postwar era. After all the blood and sacrifice, the Axis powers were defeated, but the GRAND ALLIANCE that emerged victorious did not last long. Soon the world was involved in a 45-year struggle that claimed millions of additional lives — the Cold War.


'''


====  Wartime Strategy


Three days after Congress declared war on Japan, Germany responded by declaring war on the United States.

Japan had an advance pledge of support from Hitler in the event of war with the United States. Now President Roosevelt faced a two-ocean war — a true world war. Despite widespread cries for revenge against Japan, the first major decision made by the President was to concentrate on Germany first. The American Pacific Fleet would do its best to contain Japanese expansion, while emphasis was placed on confronting Hitler's troops.



Roosevelt believed that a Nazi-dominated Europe would be far more impregnable than any defenses Japan could build in the Pacific. American scientists worried that, with enough time, German scientists might develop weapons of mass destruction. Once Hitler was defeated, the combined Allied forces would concentrate on smashing Japanese ambitions.

American military leaders favored a far more aggressive approach to attacking Germany than their British counterparts. A cross-channel invasion of France from Britain would strike at the heart of Nazi strength, but the British command was dubious. Winston Churchill feared that should such an operation fail, the loss of human life, military resources, and British morale could be fatal.

Instead, Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to implement an immediate blockade of supplies to Germany and to begin bombing German cities and munitions centers. The army would attack Hitler's troops at their weakest points first and slowly advance toward German soil. The plan was known as "CLOSING THE RING." In December 1941, Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to attack German holdings in North Africa first.

That maneuver was finally executed in October 1942. Nazi troops were occupying much of the African Mediterranean coast, which had been controlled by France prior to the war. Led by BRITISH GENERAL BERNARD MONTGOMERY, British forces struck at German and Italian troops commanded by the "DESERT FOX," German FIELD MARSHAL ERWIN ROMMEL, at EL ALAMEIN in Egypt. As the British forced a German retreat, Anglo-American forces landed on the west coast of Africa on November 8 to stage a simultaneous assault. Rommel fought gamely, but numbers and positioning soon forced a German surrender. The Allies had achieved their first important joint victory.


Simultaneously, the Soviets turned the tide against Nazi advances into the Soviet Union by defeating the German forces at Stalingrad. When springtime came in 1943, the Allies had indeed begun to close the ring.



Once Northern Africa was secured, the Allies took the next step toward Germany by launching invasions of Sicily and Italy. American and British leaders believed that when the Italian people faced occupation of their homeland, they would rise up and overthrow Mussolini. Fearing that the Allies would have a free road up to the border of Austria, German forces began to entrench themselves in Italy.

Despite German presence in Italy, Mussolini was arrested and the Italians surrendered to the Allies on September 3. There was no free road to Austria, however. German forces defended the peninsula ferociously, and even when the European war ended in May 1945, the Allies had failed to capture much of Italy.

'''


==== The American Homefront

America was the largest military power in the world — in theory.

The large population, generous natural resources, advanced infrastructure, and solid capital base were all just potential. Centralization and mobilization were necessary to jump-start this unwieldy machine. Within a week of Pearl Harbor, Congress passed the WAR POWERS ACT, granting wide authority to the President to conduct the war effort. Throughout the war hundreds more alphabet agencies were created to manage the American homefront.

First the United States needed to enlarge its armed forces. Because of the peacetime draft, the UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES boasted over 1.5 million members. By the end of the war, that number rose to 12 million. A more expansive draft and a vigorous recruitment campaign produced these results. Prodded by ELEANOR ROOSEVELT, FDR created women's auxiliary forces for the army (WACS), navy (WAVES), air force (WASPS), and Coast Guard (SPARS). The colossal ranks of the armed services created a huge labor shortage.

Toward this end a "WORK OR FIGHT" propaganda campaign was waged. "ROSIE THE RIVETER" posters beckoned housewives to leave the home and enter the nation's factories. About 6.5 million females entered the workforce during the war years, many for the first time. African Americans continued the Great Migration northward, filling vacated factory jobs. Mexican Americans were courted to cross the border to assist with the harvest season in the BRACERO GUEST-WORKER PROGRAM. Thousands of retirees went back on the job, and more and more teenagers pitched in to fill the demand for new labor.


The United States government spent over twice as much money fighting World War II as it had spent on all previous programs since its creation. Tax rates were raised to generate revenue and control inflation. Some people paid 90% of what they earned toward taxes!

Still, more money was needed so the government again launched Liberty and VICTORY LOAN DRIVES like those that helped finance the First World War. In addition, the size of the federal government more than tripled from about a million workers in 1940 to almost 3.5 million in 1945.

The United States managed to raise enough food and raw materials in the First World War through voluntary measures. This time, federal officials agreed that only through RATIONING could the demands be met. Americans were issued books of stamps for key items such as gasoline, sugar, meat, butter, canned foods, fuel oil, shoes, and rubber. No purchase of these commodities was legal without a stamp. VICTORY SPEED LIMITS attempted to conserve fuel by requiring Americans to drive more slowly. Rotating blackouts conserved fuel to be shipped overseas. Groups such as the Boy Scouts led scrap metal drives. Consumer goods like automobiles and refrigerators simply were not produced. Women drew lines down the backs of their legs to simulate nylon stockings when there were such shortages. Backyard gardens produced about 8 million tons of food.

At tremendous cost to the American taxpayer, the American people vanquished two evils: the AXIS POWERS and the Great Depression.



'''

==== D-Day and the German Surrender



The time had finally come. British and American troops had liberated North Africa and pressed on into Italy. Soviet troops had turned the tide at Stalingrad and were slowly reclaiming their territory. The ENGLISH CHANNEL was virtually free of Nazi submarines, and American and British planes were bombing German industrial centers around the clock.

Still, Hitler refused to surrender and hid behind his ATLANTIC WALL. Since the outbreak of war, Stalin was demanding an all-out effort to liberate France from German occupation. An invasion force greater than any in the history of the world was slowly amassing in southern Britain toward that end.



A great game of espionage soon unfolded. If the Germans could discover when and where the attack would occur, they could simply concentrate all their efforts in one area, and the operation would be doomed to failure. The Allies staged phony exercises meant to confuse German intelligence. Two-dimensional dummy tanks were arranged to distract air surveillance. There was considerable reason to believe the attack would come at CALAIS, where the English Channel is narrowest. In actuality, OPERATION OVERLORD was aiming for the NORMANDY PENINSULA on the morning of June 4, 1944.



After D-DAY, the days of the German resistance were numbered. Paris was liberated in August 1944 as the Allies pushed slowly eastward. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union was moving into German territory as well. Hitler, at the BATTLE OF THE BULGE, launched a final unsuccessful counteroffensive in December 1944. Soon the Americans, British, and Free French found themselves racing the Soviets to Berlin.


Following the defeat of the Nazi regime, the full extent of the Holocaust was at last revealed.  Approximately 12,000,000 people were killed between 1933-45.


Along the way they encountered the depths of Nazi horrors when they discovered concentration camps. American soldiers saw humans that looked more like skeletons, gas chambers, crematoriums, and countless victims. Although American government officials were aware of atrocities against Jews, the sheer horror of the Holocaust of 12 million Jews, homosexuals, and anyone else Hitler had deemed deviant was unknown to its fullest extent.

When the Allies entered Berlin, they discovered that the mastermind of all the destruction — Adolf Hitler — had already died by his own hand. With little left to sustain any sort of resistance, the Germans surrendered on May 8, 1945, hereafter known as V-E (VICTORY IN EUROPE) DAY.

'''

==== 51d. War in the Pacific


Defeating Germany was only part of America's mission.

Pearl Harbor was only the beginning of Japanese assaults on American holdings in the Pacific. Two days after attacking Pearl Harbor, they seized Guam, and two weeks after that they captured WAKE ISLAND. Before 1941 came to a close, the Philippines came under attack.

Led by GENERAL DOUGLAS MACARTHUR, the Americans were confident they could hold the islands. A fierce Japanese strike proved otherwise. After retreating to strongholds at BATAAN AND CORREGIDOR, the United States had no choice but to surrender the Philippines. Before being summoned away by President Roosevelt, General MacArthur promised: "I SHALL RETURN."

Before he returned however, the Japanese inflicted the BATAAN DEATH MARCH, a brutal 85-mile forced on American and Filipino POWs. 16,000 souls perished along the way.


In June 1942, Japan hoped to capture Midway Island, an American held base about 1000 miles from Hawaii. Midway could have been used as a staging point for future attacks on Pearl Harbor. The United States was still benefiting from being able to decipher Japanese radio messages. American naval commanders led by CHESTER NIMITZ therefore knew the assault was coming.

Airplane combat decided the BATTLE AT MIDWAY. After the smoke had cleared, four Japanese aircraft carriers had been destroyed. The plot to capture Midway collapsed, and Japan lost much of its offensive capability in the process. After the Battle of Midway, the Japanese were forced to fall back and defend their holdings.


In 1941, Gen. Douglas MacArthur was forced to surrender the Philippines, but made his famous promise of "I shall return." Three years later, he made good on his promise to liberate the islands.

Island hopping was the strategy used by the United States command. Rather than taking every Japanese fortification, the United States selectively chose a path that would move U.S. naval forces closer and closer to the Japanese mainland. In October 1944, MacArthur returned to the Philippines accompanied by a hundred ships and soon the islands were liberated. The capture of IWO JIMA and OKINAWA cleared the way for an all-out assault on Japan. Despite heavy losses, the Japanese refused to surrender. They intensified the attacks on American ships with suicide mission KAMIKAZE flights.


In April 1945, President Roosevelt died of a brain hemorrhage, and HARRY TRUMAN was unexpectedly left to decide the outcome of the war in the Pacific.

'''


==== Japanese-American Internment

Publicly posted instructions for Japanese-Americans to turn themselves in
Many Americans worried that citizens of Japanese ancestry would act as spies or saboteurs for the Japanese government. Fear — not evidence — drove the U.S. to place over 127,000 Japanese-Americans in concentration camps for the duration of WWII.

Over 127,000 United States citizens were imprisoned during World War II. Their crime? Being of Japanese ancestry.

Despite the lack of any concrete evidence, Japanese Americans were suspected of remaining loyal to their ancestral land. ANTI-JAPANESE PARANOIA increased because of a large Japanese presence on the West Coast. In the event of a Japanese invasion of the American mainland, Japanese Americans were feared as a security risk.

Succumbing to bad advice and popular opinion, President Roosevelt signed an executive order in February 1942 ordering the RELOCATION of all Americans of Japanese ancestry to CONCENTRATION CAMPS in the interior of the United States.

Evacuation orders were posted in JAPANESE-AMERICAN communities giving instructions on how to comply with the executive order. Many families sold their homes, their stores, and most of their assets. They could not be certain their homes and livelihoods would still be there upon their return. Because of the mad rush to sell, properties and inventories were often sold at a fraction of their true value.


After being forced from their communities, Japanese families made these military style barracks their homes.



Until the camps were completed, many of the evacuees were held in temporary centers, such as stables at local racetracks. Almost two-thirds of the interns were NISEI, or Japanese Americans born in the United States. It made no difference that many had never even been to Japan. Even Japanese-American veterans of World War I were forced to leave their homes.

Ten camps were finally completed in remote areas of seven western states. Housing was spartan, consisting mainly of tarpaper barracks. Families dined together at communal mess halls, and children were expected to attend school. Adults had the option of working for a salary of $5 per day. The United States government hoped that the interns could make the camps self-sufficient by farming to produce food. But cultivation on arid soil was quite a challenge.



Most of the ten relocation camps were built in arid and semi-arid areas where life would have been harsh under even ideal conditions.




Evacuees elected representatives to meet with government officials to air grievances, often to little avail. Recreational activities were organized to pass the time. Some of the interns actually volunteered to fight in one of two all-Nisei army regiments and went on to distinguish themselves in battle.




On the whole, however, life in the relocation centers was not easy. The camps were often too cold in the winter and too hot in the summer. The food was mass produced army-style grub. And the interns knew that if they tried to flee, armed sentries who stood watch around the clock, would shoot them.

FRED KOREMATSU decided to test the government relocation action in the courts. He found little sympathy there. In KOREMATSU VS. THE UNITED STATES, the Supreme Court justified the executive order as a wartime necessity. When the order was repealed, many found they could not return to their hometowns. Hostility against Japanese Americans remained high across the West Coast into the postwar years as many villages displayed signs demanding that the evacuees never return. As a result, the interns scattered across the country.

In 1988, Congress attempted to apologize for the action by awarding each surviving intern $20,000. While the American concentration camps never reached the levels of Nazi death camps as far as atrocities are concerned, they remain a dark mark on the nation's record of respecting civil liberties and cultural differences.


'''

==== The Manhattan Project



Early in 1939, the world's scientific community discovered that German physicists had learned the secrets of splitting a uranium atom. Fears soon spread over the possibility of Nazi scientists utilizing that energy to produce a bomb capable of unspeakable destruction.

Scientists ALBERT EINSTEIN, who fled Nazi persecution, and ENRICO FERMI, who escaped Fascist Italy, were now living in the United States. They agreed that the President must be informed of the dangers of atomic technology in the hands of the Axis powers. Fermi traveled to Washington in March to express his concerns to government officials. But few shared his uneasiness.


Einstein penned a letter to President Roosevelt urging the development of an atomic research program later that year. Roosevelt saw neither the necessity nor the utility for such a project, but agreed to proceed slowly. In late 1941, the American effort to design and build an ATOMIC BOMB received its code name — the MANHATTAN PROJECT.

At first the research was based at only a few universities — Columbia University, the University of Chicago and the University of California at Berkeley. A breakthrough occurred in December 1942 when Fermi led a group of physicists to produce the first controlled NUCLEAR CHAIN REACTION under the grandstands of STAGG FIELD at the University of Chicago.


After this milestone, funds were allocated more freely, and the project advanced at breakneck speed. Nuclear facilities were built at Oak Ridge, Tennessee and Hanford, Washington. The main assembly plant was built at LOS ALAMOS, NEW MEXICO. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER was put in charge of putting the pieces together at Los Alamos. After the final bill was tallied, nearly $2 billion had been spent on research and development of the atomic bomb. The Manhattan Project employed over 120,000 Americans.

Secrecy was paramount. Neither the Germans nor the Japanese could learn of the project. Roosevelt and Churchill also agreed that Stalin would be kept in the dark. Consequently, there was no public awareness or debate. Keeping 120,000 people quiet would be impossible; therefore only a small privileged cadre of inner scientists and officials knew about the atomic bomb's development. In fact, Vice-President Truman had never heard of the Manhattan Project until he became President Truman.

Although the Axis powers remained unaware of the efforts at Los Alamos, American leaders later learned that a Soviet spy named KLAUS FUCHS had penetrated the inner circle of scientists.



By the summer of 1945, Oppenheimer was ready to test the first bomb. On July 16, 1945, at TRINITY SITE near ALAMOGORDO, NEW MEXICO, scientists of the Manhattan Project readied themselves to watch the detonation of the world's first atomic bomb.

The world had entered the nuclear age.

'''

==== The Decision to Drop the Bomb


America had the bomb. Now what?

When Harry Truman learned of the success of the Manhattan Project, he knew he was faced with a decision of unprecedented gravity. The capacity to end the war with Japan was in his hands, but it would involve unleashing the most terrible weapon ever known.

American soldiers and civilians were weary from four years of war, yet the Japanese military was refusing to give up their fight. American forces occupied Okinawa and Iwo Jima and were intensely fire bombing Japanese cities. But Japan had an army of 2 million strong stationed in the home islands guarding against invasion.



For Truman, the choice whether or not to use the atomic bomb was the most difficult decision of his life.

First, an Allied demand for an immediate unconditional surrender was made to the leadership in Japan. Although the demand stated that refusal would result in total destruction, no mention of any new weapons of mass destruction was made. The Japanese military command rejected the request for unconditional surrender, but there were indications that a conditional surrender was possible.

Regardless, on August 6, 1945, a plane called the ENOLA GAY dropped an atomic bomb on the city of HIROSHIMA. Instantly, 70,000 Japanese citizens were vaporized. In the months and years that followed, an additional 100,000 perished from burns and radiation sickness.


Two days later, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan. On August 9, a second atomic bomb was dropped on NAGASAKI, where 80,000 Japanese people perished.

On August 14, 1945, the Japanese surrendered.


Other critics argued that American diplomats had ulterior motives. The Soviet Union had entered the war against Japan, and the atomic bomb could be read as a strong message for the Soviets to tread lightly. In this respect, Hiroshima and Nagasaki may have been the first shots of the Cold War as well as the final shots of World War II.

Truman stated that his decision to drop the bomb was purely military. A Normandy-type amphibious landing would have cost an estimated million casualties. Truman believed that the bombs saved Japanese lives as well. Prolonging the war was not an option for the President. Over 3,500 Japanese kamikaze raids had already wrought great destruction and loss of American lives.

The President rejected a demonstration of the atomic bomb to the Japanese leadership. He knew there was no guarantee the Japanese would surrender if the test succeeded, and he felt that a failed demonstration would be worse than none at all. Even the scientific community failed to foresee the awful effects of RADIATION SICKNESS. Truman saw little difference between atomic bombing Hiroshima and FIRE BOMBING Dresden or Tokyo.

Pandora's box was now open. The question that came flying out was, "How will the world use its nuclear capability?" It is a question still being addressed on a daily basis.
