=== The Vietnam War 越南战争

The VIETNAM WAR was the second-longest war in United States history, after the war in Afghanistan.

[.my2]
越南战争是美国历史上第二长的战争，仅次于阿富汗战争。

`主` Promises 承诺，诺言 and commitments to the people and government of South Vietnam to keep communist forces from overtaking them `谓`  reached back into the Truman Administration. +
Eisenhower placed (v.) military advisers and CIA operatives 操作者；作业人员 in Vietnam, and John F. Kennedy sent American soldiers to Vietnam. +
Lyndon Johnson ordered the first real combat by American troops, and Richard Nixon concluded (v.)（使）结束，终止 the war.

[.my2]
杜鲁门政府向南越人民和政府, 做出了阻止共产主义势力超越南越的承诺和承诺。艾森豪威尔在越南派遣军事顾问和中央情报局特工，约翰·肯尼迪则派遣美国士兵前往越南。林登·约翰逊下令美军进行第一次真正的战斗，理查德·尼克松结束了战争。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Promises 和 commitments 的区别
- promise（承诺、诺言） : 可以是正式的或非正式的，*通常不涉及具体的行动计划或责任。*
- commitment（承诺、责任、义务） : 是一种更加正式和深刻的承诺，*通常涉及具体的责任和义务，暗示一定的行动或表现。* 因此, 它通常比“promise”更具约束力，强调持续的责任和投入。
====


Despite the decades of resolve (n.)决心；坚定的信念, billions and billions of dollars, nearly 60,000 American lives and many more injuries, the United States failed to achieve its objectives.

[.my2]
尽管几十年来下了决心，投入了数十亿美元，造成近 60,000 名美国人丧生和更多人受伤，但美国仍未能实现其目标。

One factor that influenced the failure of the United States in Vietnam `系` was lack of public support. +
However, `主` #the notion# 观念；信念；理解 that the war initially *was prosecuted* (v.)继续从事（或参与） by the government *against* the wishes 心愿;想要的东西；希望的事 of the American people `系` #is false# 错误的，不真实的. +

image:/img/123.svg[,100%]

`主` The notion that the vast majority of American youths `谓`  took 采取（措施）；采用（方法） to the streets to end (v.) the Vietnam War `系` is equally false. +
Early initiatives 倡议；新方案 by the United States under Truman, Eisenhower, and Kennedy `谓` received broad support.

[.my2]
影响美国在越南失败的因素之一, 是缺乏公众支持。然而，#有关#"最初战争是在违背美国人民意愿的情况下, 由政府进行"#的观念, 是错误的#。关于"绝大多数美国年轻人走上街头, 要求结束越南战争"的观念同样是错误的。在杜鲁门、艾森豪威尔和肯尼迪领导下，美国早期的行动得到了广泛支持。




Only two members of the United States Congress `谓` voted against granting (v.) Johnson broad authority to wage (v.)  the war in Vietnam, and most Americans supported (v.) this measure as well. +
The antiwar movement in 1965 was small, and news of its activities was buried (v.) in the inner pages 内页 of newspapers, if there was any mention at all. +
Only later in the war `谓` did public opinion sour （牛奶等）变味，酸腐;（使）变坏，恶化.

[.my2]
只有两名美国国会议员, 投票反对授予约翰逊在越南发动战争的广泛权力，大多数美国人也支持这一举措。 1965年的反战运动规模很小，有关其活动的新闻即使有提及，也被埋在报纸的内页中。直到战争后期，公众舆论才开始恶化。

The enemy was hard to identify. +
The war was not fought between conventional 传统的；习惯的 army forces. +
The Viet Cong 越共游击队 blended (v.)使混合；掺和 in with the native population 本地人 and struck by ambush  (n.)伏击，埋伏, often at night. +
Massive American _bombing campaigns_ hit (v.) their targets, but failed to make the North Vietnamese concede (v.)（尤指勉强地）让与，让步；允许;承认（某事属实、合乎逻辑等）. +

Promises made by American military and political leaders that _the war would soon be over_ `谓` were broken.

[.my2]
敌人很难辨认。战争不是在常规军队之间进行的。越共与当地居民混在一起，经常在夜间遭到伏击。美国的大规模轰炸袭击了目标，但未能使北越认输。美国军事和政治领导人关于战争很快结束的承诺, 被打破了。

====

And night after night, Americans turned on the news to see _the bodies of their young_ flown (v.)（fly的过去分词） home in bags. +
`主` _Draft 征募；征召 injustices_ like _college deferments_ (n.)延期，推迟 `谓` surfaced, *hearkening (v.)倾听；聆听 back to* 使想起；和（过去的事物）相似 the similar controversies 争论；辩论 of the Civil War. +
_The average age_ of the American soldier in Vietnam was nineteen. +
As the months of the war `谓` became years, the public became impatient.

[.my2]
夜复一夜，美国人打开新闻, 看到他们孩子的尸体被装在袋子里空运回家。诸如大学延期入学之类的征兵不公正现象也浮出水面(但**上大学虽然可以推迟服兵役, 但并不能豁免服役**)，让人回想起美国内战时期的类似争议。**在越南的美国士兵, 平均年龄只有十九岁。**随着战争从几个月变成几年，公众变得不耐烦了。

•The newest styles *hark back to* the clothes of the Seventies. 最新的款式使人想起七十年代的服装。

.Draft injustices like college deferments surfaced, *hearkening back to* the similar controversies of the Civil War.

chatgpt: 在这句话中将 "hearkening back to" 改成 "hark back to" 是可以的，并且两者在意思上没有区别。它们都表示“回顾”或“追溯到”。"Hark back to" 是较常见的用法，且更加简洁。

The legacy of bitterness divided (v.) the American citizenry 全体市民（或公民） and influenced (v.) foreign policy into the 21st century.

[.my2]
痛苦的遗产使美国公民分裂，并影响了进入 21 世纪的外交政策。

**约翰逊被受共和党建议提出了“伟大社会”这一立法举措，推动维护民权、公共广播、联邦医保、医疗补助、教育援助、艺术、城市及乡村发展、公共服务及“向贫穷宣战”。**在约翰逊任内，向贫穷宣战政策及经济的发展, 使数百万美国人脱离了贫困阶层。

*约翰逊同时签署了一系列民权法案，禁止在公共设施、跨州贸易、工作场所及住房领域进行种族歧视，*《选举权法案》则取缔了南方一些州对非裔美国人"选举权"进行的限制。 +
《1965年移民及国籍法案》则改革了美国的移民体系，以种族为尺度的移民配额制度终结，以国籍为尺度的制度开始实施。

史学家称, "新政"时期后的美国现代自由主义, 在约翰逊任内达到了顶峰。由于其在国内政绩优异，推动立法对民权、枪支管制、原野保护, 及社会保险等有重大影响，尽管他对外在越战上受挫，许多史学家对其评价仍旧颇为积极，在美国总统排名中依旧较为靠前。

美国还轰炸了胡志明小道，这是北越用来援助"越共"的补给线。这条路线蜿蜒穿过老挝和柬埔寨，因此爆炸事件对国会和美国人民保密。整个二战期间，落在越南的炸弹数量, 比盟军对轴心国使用的炸弹数量还多。

|二噁英有剧毒，可导致生殖和发育问题，损害免疫系统，干扰激素并导致癌症。

一旦进入人体，由于其化学稳定性和**被脂肪组织吸收**的能力，二噁英会持续存在很长时间，并储存在体内。**它们在人体内的半衰期估计为7至11年。** +
在环境中，二噁英往往在食物链中积累。*动物在食物链中的地位越高，体内二噁英的浓度就越高。*

|来源
|二噁英主要是工业过程的副产品，但也可能是火山爆发和森林火灾等自然过程的产物。**它们是许多制造过程中不需要的副产品，**包括**冶炼、纸浆的氯漂白, 以及某些除草剂和杀虫剂的制造。** +
不受制约的**废物焚烧炉（固体废物和医院废物）**, 通常是**不完全燃烧**导致环境释放的最严重罪魁祸首。现有技术可通过受控废物焚烧, 实现较低的二噁英排放。

凝固汽油弹, 是几种武器用途的可燃液体之总称，大多以胶状汽油为主成分。主要通过黏附在人员表面持续燃烧, 来造成伤害。

早期的流质燃剂, 容易喷溅, 又难以附着在目标物上，难达到集中杀伤的目的。美国发现改**用"胶状汽油"（gasoline gel）可以提升喷火器的射程与效用.** +
**但是制造"胶状汽油", 须使用大量的"天然橡胶"，**但天然橡胶不仅价格昂贵、产量较低，且在二战初期，日军占领了马来西亚、印度尼西亚、越南和泰国等天然橡胶的主要产地后，同盟国的橡胶来源基本上被切断。

因此, 美国研发出能大规模工业生产的"合成橡胶"，并且可以用于汽车轮胎、坦克履带, 和雨衣等各种用途。并**研发出可应用于"合成橡胶"的"凝固汽油".**

燃烧汽油弹另外一个实用但危险的效果，是**它会“急速消耗附近空气中的氧气，并产生大量的一氧化碳”，进而造成邻近的生物窒息，**通常用于大吨数炸弹时会发生此效应。

凝固汽油弹在朝鲜战争中被广泛应用，在越南战争中达到了顶峰.

During the BUDDHIST holiday of TET, over 80,000 Vietcong troops emerged (v.) from their tunnels and attacked (v.) nearly every _major metropolitan (a.)大城市的；大都会的 center_ in South Vietnam. +
Surprise strikes were made at the American base at DANANG 岘港, and even the seemingly impenetrable 不可进入的；穿不过的；无法透视的 American embassy 大使馆；（统称）使馆官员 in SAIGON was attacked.

[.my2]
在佛教节日春节期间，超过 80,000 名越共军队从地道中涌出，袭击了南越几乎所有主要大都市中心。美国在岘港的基地遭到突然袭击，甚至看似坚不可摧的美国驻西贡大使馆, 也遭到袭击。

During the weeks that followed, the South Vietnamese army and U.S.
ground forces 地面部队 recaptured (v.)重新捕获，夺回 all of the lost territory, inflicting (v.)使遭受打击；使吃苦头 twice *as many* casualties on the Vietcong *as* suffered by the Americans.

[.my2]
1965 年“滚雷行动”开始时，只有 15% 的美国公众反对越南战争。直到 1968 年 1 月，距离春节仅几周，只有 28% 的美国公众称自己为“鸽派”。但到了 1968 年 4 月，即春节攻势六周后，反对战争的‘鸽派’, 以42%比41%的比例, 超过了支持战争的‘鹰派’。 +
即 反对战争的美国公众（称为 "DOVES"）的比例为42%，而支持战争的公众（称为 "HAWKS"）的比例为41%。

Only 28% of the American people were satisfied with President Johnson's handling (n.)（形势、人、动物等的）处理，对付，对待 of the war. +
The Tet Offensive convinced (v.)使确信，使信服；说服，劝服 many Americans that government statements (n.)声明，报告；说明，说法 about _the war being nearly over_ `系` were false. +

[.my1]

[.my2]
春节过后，威斯特摩兰将军请求增派 20 万军队，以对越共施加更大压力。他的请求被拒绝了。约翰逊总统知道，动用如此多的后备力量，让美国承诺提供近四分之三的百万士兵，这在政治上是站不住脚的。

When the war in Vietnam began, many Americans believed that `主` defending South Vietnam from communist aggression `系` was in the national interest. +
Communism was threatening free governments across the globe. +
Any sign of non-intervention from the United States `谓` might encourage revolutions elsewhere.

[.my2]
当越南战争开始时，*许多美国人认为保卫南越免受共产主义侵略, 符合美国国家利益。共产主义正在威胁全球的自由政府。美国任何不干预的迹象, 都可能会鼓励其他地方的革命。*

As the war dragged on 拖长, more and more Americans grew *weary (a.)疲劳的，疲倦的，疲惫的;（对…）不再感兴趣，不再热心，感到不耐烦 of* mounting (a.)上升的，增长的 casualties and escalating (a.)逐步上涨的 costs. +

胡志明是越南最受欢迎的领导人，而美国支持的是一个不民主、腐败的军事政权。年轻的美国士兵正在遭受痛苦和死亡。他们在经济问题上的论点没有那么复杂，但同样对战争努力持批评态度。军费开支只是从福利、住房和城市更新等“伟大社会”社会项目中拿走了钱。

The Draft

草案

The draft was another major source 来源，出处 of resentment 愤恨，怨恨 among college students. +
The age of the average American soldier serving in Vietnam `系` was 19, seven years younger than its World War II counterpart. +
Students observed that /young Americans were legally old enough to fight (v.) and die, but were not permitted to vote (v.) or drink alcohol. +
Such criticism (n.)批评；批判；责备；指责 led to the 26TH AMENDMENT, which granted suffrage 选举权；投票权 to 18-year-olds.

[.my2]
该草案是大学生不满的另一个主要根源。*在越南服役的美国士兵的平均年龄为 19 岁，比二战时期的士兵年轻 7 岁。学生们观察到，年轻的美国人在法律上已经达到了可以战斗和死亡的年龄，但不允许投票或喝酒。此类批评导致了第 26 条修正案的出台，该修正案赋予 18 岁青少年选举权。*

第二十六修正案的内容是: 年满十八岁和十八岁以上的合众国公民的"选举权"，不得因为年龄而被合众国或任何一州加以拒绝或限制。 +
*即, 自1972年起，年满18岁的美国公民, 正式享有投票权。*

=== The Vietnam War

The VIETNAM WAR was the second-longest war in United States history, after the war in Afghanistan.

Promises and commitments to the people and government of South Vietnam to keep communist forces from overtaking them reached back into the Truman Administration. Eisenhower placed military advisers and CIA operatives in Vietnam, and John F. Kennedy sent American soldiers to Vietnam. Lyndon Johnson ordered the first real combat by American troops, and Richard Nixon concluded the war.

Despite the decades of resolve, billions and billions of dollars, nearly 60,000 American lives and many more injuries, the United States failed to achieve its objectives.

One factor that influenced the failure of the United States in Vietnam was lack of public support. However, the notion that the war initially was prosecuted by the government against the wishes of the American people is false. The notion that the vast majority of American youths took to the streets to end the Vietnam War is equally false. Early initiatives by the United States under Truman, Eisenhower, and Kennedy received broad support.

Only two members of the United States Congress voted against granting Johnson broad authority to wage the war in Vietnam, and most Americans supported this measure as well. The antiwar movement in 1965 was small, and news of its activities was buried in the inner pages of newspapers, if there was any mention at all. Only later in the war did public opinion sour.

The enemy was hard to identify. The war was not fought between conventional army forces. The Viet Cong blended in with the native population and struck by ambush, often at night. Massive American bombing campaigns hit their targets, but failed to make the North Vietnamese concede. Promises made by American military and political leaders that the war would soon be over were broken.

And night after night, Americans turned on the news to see the bodies of their young flown home in bags. Draft injustices like college deferments surfaced, hearkening back to the similar controversies of the Civil War. The average age of the American soldier in Vietnam was nineteen. As the months of the war became years, the public became impatient.



Only a small percentage of Americans believed their government was evil or sympathized with the Viet Cong. But many began to feel it was time to cut losses.

President Nixon signed a ceasefire in January 1973 that formally ended the hostilities. In 1975, communist forces from the north overran the south and unified the nation. Neighboring CAMBODIA and LAOS also became communist dictatorships. At home, returning Vietnamese veterans found readjustment and even acceptance difficult. The scars of Vietnam would not heal quickly for the United States.

The legacy of bitterness divided the American citizenry and influenced foreign policy into the 21st century.


'''


==== Early Involvement


Ho Chi Minh's resistance to colonial powers in Indochina led to the formation of the Marxist liberation movement known as the Viet Minh. The United States provided financial support to France's fight against Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh from the 1940s until direct U.S. involvement.

While Americans were girding to fight the Civil War in 1860, the French were beginning a century-long imperial involvement in Indochina. The lands now known as Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia comprised INDOCHINA. The riches to be harvested in these lands proved economically enticing to the French.


After World War I, a nationalist movement formed in Vietnam led by HO CHI MINH. Ho was educated in the West, where he became a disciple of Marxist thought. Ho resented and resisted the French. When the Japanese invaded Vietnam during World War II, they displaced French rule. Ho formed a liberation movement known as the Viet Minh. Using guerrilla warfare, the VIET MINH battled the Japanese and held many key cities by 1945. Paraphrasing the Declaration of Independence, Ho proclaimed the new nation of Vietnam — a new nation Western powers refused to recognize.

France was determined to reclaim all its territories after World War II. The United States now faced an interesting dilemma. American tradition dictated sympathy for the revolutionaries over any colonial power. However, supporting the Marxist Viet Minh was unthinkable, given the new strategy of containing communism.

Domino Theory

American diplomats subscribed to the DOMINO THEORY. A communist victory in Vietnam might lead to communist victories in Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Such a scenario was unthinkable to the makers of American foreign policy.


President Truman decided to support France in its efforts to reclaim Indochina by providing money and military advisers. The United States financial commitment amounted to nearly $1 billion per year.

The French found Ho Chi Minh a formidable adversary. Between 1945 and 1954 a fierce war developed between the two sides. Slowly but surely, the Viet Minh wore down the French will to fight. On May, 8th, 1954 a large regiment of French troops was captured by the Vietnamese led by communist general VO NGUYEN GIAP at DIEN BIEN PHU.

A Nation Divided

The rest of the French troops withdrew, leaving a buffer zone separating the North and South. Negotiations to end the conflict took place in Geneva. A multinational agreement divided Vietnam at the 17th parallel. The territory north of this line would be led by Ho Chi Minh with Hanoi its capital.

The southern sector named Saigon its capital and Ngo Dinh Diem its leader. This division was meant to be temporary, with nationwide elections scheduled for 1956. Knowing that Ho Chi Minh would be a sure victor, the South made sure these elections were never held.

During the administrations of Eisenhower and Kennedy, the United States continued to supply funds, weapons, and military advisers to SOUTH VIETNAM. Ho Chi Minh turned NORTH VIETNAM into a communist dictatorship and created a new band of GUERRILLAS in the South called the Viet Cong, whose sole purpose was to overthrow the military regime in the South and reunite the nation under Ho Chi Minh.

The United States was backing an unpopular leader in NGO DINH DIEM. Diem was corrupt, showed little commitment to democratic principles, and favored Catholics to the dismay of the Buddhist majority. In November 1963, Diem was murdered in a coup with apparent CIA involvement.

Few of Ngo's successors fared any better, while Ho Chi Minh was the Vietnamese equivalent of George Washington. He had successfully won the hearts and minds of the majority of the Vietnamese people. Two weeks after the fall of Diem, Kennedy himself was felled by an assassin's bullet.

By the time Lyndon Johnson inherited the Presidency, Vietnam was a bitterly divided nation. The United States would soon too be divided on what to do in Vietnam.



'''

==== Years of Escalation: 1965-68


It was David vs. Goliath, with U.S. playing Goliath.

On August 2, 1964, gunboats of North Vietnam allegedly fired on ships of the United States Navy stationed in the GULF OF TONKIN. They had been sailing 10 miles off the coast of North Vietnam in support of the South Vietnamese navy.

When reports that further firing occurred on August 4, President Johnson quickly asked Congress to respond. With nearly unanimous consent, members of the Senate and House empowered Johnson to "take all necessary measures" to repel North Vietnamese aggression. The Tonkin Gulf Resolution gave the President a "BLANK CHECK" to wage the war in Vietnam as he saw fit. After Lyndon Johnson was elected President in his own right that November, he chose escalate the conflict.

Operation Rolling Thunder

In February 1965, the United States began a long program of sustained bombing of North Vietnamese targets known as OPERATION ROLLING THUNDER. At first only military targets were hit, but as months turned into years, civilian targets were pummeled as well.

The United States also bombed the Ho Chi Minh trail, a supply line used by the North Vietnamese to aid the VIETCONG. The trail meandered through Laos and Cambodia, so the bombing was kept secret from the Congress and the American people. More bombs rained down on Vietnam than the Allies used on the Axis powers during the whole of World War II.

Additional sorties delivered defoliating agents such as AGENT ORANGE and napalm to remove the jungle cover utilized by the Vietcong. The intense bombardment did little to deter the communists. They continued to use the Ho Chi Minh trail despite the grave risk. The burrowed underground, building 30,000 miles of tunnel networks to keep supply lines open.

Ground Troops

Agent Orange +
Often unable to see the enemy through the dense growth of Vietnam's jungles, the U.S. military sprayed a chemical herbicide known as "Agent Orange" in an attempt to destroy the trees. Currently, debate rages on whether or not exposure to this compound is responsible for disease and disability in many Vietnam veterans.

It soon became clear to GENERAL WILLIAM WESTMORELAND, the American military commander, that combat troops would be necessary to root out the enemy. Beginning in March 1965, when the first American combat troops waded ashore at Danang, the United States began "search and destroy" missions.

One of the most confounding problems faced by U.S. military personnel in Vietnam was identifying the enemy. The same Vietnamese peasant who waved hello in the daytime might be a VC guerrilla fighter by night. The United States could not indiscriminately kill South Vietnamese peasants. Any mistake resulted in a dead ally and an angrier population.

Search and destroy missions were conducted by moving into a village and inspecting for any signs of Vietcong support. If any evidence was found, the troops would conduct a "ZIPPO RAID" by torching the village to the ground and confiscating discovered munitions. Most efforts were fruitless, as the VC proved adept at covering their tracks. The enemy surrounded and confounded the Americans but direct confrontation was rare.


By the end of 1965, there were American 189,000 troops stationed in Vietnam. At the end of the following year, that number doubled. Casualty reports steadily increased. Unlike World War II, there were  few major ground battles.

Most Vietnamese attacks were by ambush or night skirmishes. Many Americans died by stepping on landmines or by triggering BOOBY TRAPS. Although Vietnamese body counts were higher, Americans were dying at rate of approximately 100 per week through 1967. By the end of that year there were nearly 500,000 American combat troops stationed in Vietnam.

General Westmoreland promised a settlement soon, but the end was not in sight.


'''


==== The Tet Offensive


During the BUDDHIST holiday of TET, over 80,000 Vietcong troops emerged from their tunnels and attacked nearly every major metropolitan center in South Vietnam. Surprise strikes were made at the American base at DANANG, and even the seemingly impenetrable American embassy in SAIGON was attacked.

During the weeks that followed, the South Vietnamese army and U.S. ground forces recaptured all of the lost territory, inflicting twice as many casualties on the Vietcong as suffered by the Americans.

The showdown was a military victory for the United States, but American morale suffered an insurmountable blow.

Doves Outnumber Hawks

When Operation Rolling Thunder began in 1965, only 15 percent of the American public opposed the war effort in Vietnam. As late as January 1968, only a few weeks before Tet, only 28 percent of the American public labeled themselves "doves." But by April 1968, six weeks after the TET OFFENSIVE, "DOVES" outnumbered "HAWKS" 42 to 41 percent.

Only 28% of the American people were satisfied with President Johnson's handling of the war. The Tet Offensive convinced many Americans that government statements about the war being nearly over were false. After three years of intense bombing, billions of dollars and 500,000 troops, the VC proved themselves capable of attacking anywhere they chose. The message was simple: this war was not almost over. The end was nowhere in sight.

Sagging U.S. Troop Morale

Declining public support brought declining troop morale. Many soldiers questioned the wisdom of American involvement. Soldiers indulged in alcohol, marijuana, and even heroin to escape their daily horrors. Incidents of "FRAGGING," or the murder of officers by their own troops increased in the years that followed Tet. Soldiers who completed their yearlong tour of duty often found hostile receptions upon returning to the states.

General William Westmoreland

Following the Tet Offensive, General William Westmoreland called for an additional 200,000 troops to help break the resolve of the Vietcong. But President Lyndon B. Johnson's rejection of the proposal showed that America's commitment to the war in Vietnam was waning.

After Tet, General Westmoreland requested an additional 200,000 troops to put added pressure on the Vietcong. His request was denied. President Johnson knew that activating that many reserves, bringing the total American commitment to nearly three quarters of a million soldiers was not politically tenable.

The North Vietnamese sensed the crumbling of American resolve. They knew that the longer the war raged, the more antiwar sentiment in America would grow. They gambled that the American people would demand troop withdrawals before the military met its objectives.

For the next five years they pretended to negotiate with United States, making proposals they knew would be rejected. With each passing day, the number of "hawks" in America decreased. Only a small percentage of Americans objected to the war on moral grounds, but a growing majority saw the war as an effort whose price of victory was way too high.

'''


==== The Antiwar Movement


Of all the lessons learned from Vietnam, one rings louder than all the rest — it is impossible to win a long, protracted war without popular support.

When the war in Vietnam began, many Americans believed that defending South Vietnam from communist aggression was in the national interest. Communism was threatening free governments across the globe. Any sign of non-intervention from the United States might encourage revolutions elsewhere.

As the war dragged on, more and more Americans grew weary of mounting casualties and escalating costs. The small antiwar movement grew into an unstoppable force, pressuring American leaders to reconsider its commitment.

PEACE MOVEMENT leaders opposed the war on moral and economic grounds. The North Vietnamese, they argued, were fighting a patriotic war to rid themselves of foreign aggressors. Innocent Vietnamese peasants were being killed in the crossfire. American planes wrought environmental damage by dropping their defoliating chemicals.

Ho Chi Minh was the most popular leader in all of Vietnam, and the United States was supporting an undemocratic, corrupt military regime. Young American soldiers were suffering and dying. Their economic arguments were less complex, but as critical of the war effort. Military spending simply took money away from Great Society social programs such as welfare, housing, and urban renewal.

The Draft

The draft was another major source of resentment among college students. The age of the average American soldier serving in Vietnam was 19, seven years younger than its World War II counterpart. Students observed that young Americans were legally old enough to fight and die, but were not permitted to vote or drink alcohol. Such criticism led to the 26TH AMENDMENT, which granted suffrage to 18-year-olds.



Because DRAFT DEFERMENTS were granted to college students, the less affluent and less educated made up a disproportionate percentage of combat troops. Once drafted, Americans with higher levels of education were often given military office jobs. About 80 percent of American ground troops in Vietnam came from the lower classes. Latino and African American males were assigned to combat more regularly than drafted white Americans.

Antiwar demonstrations were few at first, with active participants numbering in the low thousands when Congress passed the TONKIN GULF RESOLUTION. Events in Southeast Asia and at home caused those numbers to grow as the years passed. As the Johnson Administration escalated the commitment, the peace movement grew. Television changed many minds. Millions of Americans watched body bags leave the Asian rice paddies every night in their living rooms.


Give Peace a Chance

The late 1960s became increasingly radical as the activists felt their demands were ignored. Peaceful demonstrations turned violent. When the police arrived to arrest protesters, the crowds often retaliated. Students occupied buildings across college campuses forcing many schools to cancel classes. Roads were blocked and ROTC buildings were burned. Doves clashed with police and the National Guard in August 1968, when antiwar demonstrators flocked to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago to prevent the nomination of a prowar candidate.



Despite the growing antiwar movement, a silent majority of Americans still supported the Vietnam effort. Many admitted that involvement was a mistake, but military defeat was unthinkable.

When Richard Nixon was inaugurated in January 1969, the nation was bitterly divided over what course of action to follow next.

'''


==== Years of Withdrawal


President Nixon had a plan to end American involvement in Vietnam.

By the time he entered the White House in 1969, he knew the American war effort was failing. Greater military power may have brought a favorable outcome, but there were no guarantees. And the American people were less and less willing to support any sort of escalation with each passing day.

Immediate American withdrawal would amount to a defeat of the noncommunist South Vietnamese allies. Nixon announced a plan later known as VIETNAMIZATION. The United States would gradually withdraw troops from Southeast Asia as American military personnel turned more and more of the fighting over to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. In theory, as the South Vietnamese became more able to defend themselves, United States soldiers could go home without a communist takeover of Saigon.

Troop withdrawals did little to placate the antiwar movement. Demonstrators wanted an immediate and complete departure. Events in Vietnam and at home gave greater strength to the protesters.

In the spring of 1970, President Nixon announced a temporary invasion of neighboring Cambodia. Although Cambodia was technically neutral, the Ho Chi Minh trail stretched through its territory. Nixon ordered the Viet Cong bases located along the trail to be bombed.

Kent State and MY LAI MASSACRES

Peace advocates were enraged. They claimed that Nixon was expanding the war, not reducing it as promised. Protests were mounted across America.

At KENT STATE UNIVERSITY, students rioted in protest. They burned down the ROTC building located on campus, and destroyed local property. The governor of Ohio sent the National Guard to maintain order. A state of high tension and confusion hung between the Guard and the students. Several soldiers fired their rifles, leading to deaths of four students and the wounding of several others. This became known as the Kent State massacre.


The following year the American public learned about the My Lai massacre. In 1968, American soldiers opened fire on several hundred women and children in the tiny hamlet of My Lai. How could this happen? It was not unusual for Viet Cong guerilla activity to be initiated from small villages. Further, U.S. troops were tired, scared, and confused.

At first the Lieutenant who had given the order, WILLIAM L. CALLEY, JR., was declared guilty of murder, but the ruling was later overturned. Moral outrage swept through the antiwar movement. They cited My Lai as an example of how American soldiers were killing innocent peasants.

The Pentagon Papers

In 1971, the New York Times published excerpts from the PENTAGON PAPERS, a top-secret overview of the history of government involvement in Vietnam. A participant in the study named DANIEL ELLSBERG believed the American public needed to know some of the secrets, so he leaked information to the press. The Pentagon Papers revealed a high-level deception of the American public by the Johnson Administration.

Evacuation of Saigon

The North Vietnamese Army captured Saigon in April, 1975, and renamed the capital Ho Chi Minh City. It was at this time that the last remaining American personnel in Vietnam were forced to flee.

Many statements released about the military situation in Vietnam were simply untrue, including the possibility that even the bombing of American naval boats in the Gulf of Tonkin might never have happened. A growing credibility gap between the truth and what the government said was true caused many Americans to grow even more cynical about the war.

By December 1972, Nixon decided to escalate the bombing of North Vietnamese cities, including Hanoi. He hoped this initiative would push North Vietnam to the peace table. In January 1973, a ceasefire was reached, and the remaining American combat troops were withdrawn. Nixon called the agreement "peace with honor," but he knew the South Vietnamese Army would have difficulty maintaining control.

The North soon attacked the South and in April 1975 they captured Saigon. Vietnam was united into one communist nation. Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City. Cambodia and Laos soon followed with communist regimes of their own. The United States was finally out of Vietnam. But every single one of its political objectives for the region met with failure.

Over 55,000 Americans perished fighting the Vietnam War.
