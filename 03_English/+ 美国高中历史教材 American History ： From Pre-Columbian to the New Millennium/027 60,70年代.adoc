在国内，肯尼迪在一定程度上延续了自由民主党人罗斯福和杜鲁门的传统。他签署了提高最低工资, 和增加社会保障福利的立法。他筹集资金用于精神疾病研究，并拨款发展贫困农村地区。他支持詹姆斯·梅雷迪思进入密西西比大学就读，并命令他的当司法部长弟弟罗伯特·肯尼迪, 保护南方的自由乘车者，这表明了他对民权运动的认可。

Although occupied with the Vietnam War, Nixon also initiated several new trends in American diplomatic relations. +

Given 考虑到；鉴于 the long history of animosity (n.)憎恶，仇恨，敌意 between those two nations, Nixon and his adviser HENRY KISSINGER 基辛格, decided to exploit (v.)利用（…为自己谋利） that rivalry (n.)竞争，较量 to win (v.) advantages for the United States. +
That policy became known as triangular diplomacy.

[.my2]
**与他的前任不同，理查德·尼克松渴望以其在"外交政策"方面的专业知识而闻名。**尽管忙于越南战争，尼克松也开创了美国外交关系的几个新趋势。*尼克松认为，共产主义世界由两个敌对大国组成——苏联和中国。鉴于这两个国家之间长期以来的敌对历史，尼克松和他的顾问亨利·基辛格决定利用这种竞争, 为美国赢得优势。这项政策被称为"三角外交"。*

As President Nixon's _national security adviser_, Henry Kissinger made a secret trip to arrange (v.)安排，筹备 the first-ever (a.)首次的，前所未有的 Presidential visit to China in 1972. +
He would become Nixon's _secretary of state_ 国务卿 the next year.

[.my2]
作为尼克松总统的国家安全顾问，亨利·基辛格于1972年秘密出访，安排总统首次访华。次年他就任尼克松的国务卿。

As expected 正如所料, this maneuver 细致巧妙的移动，机动动作；策略，手段 caused (v.) concern  担心，忧虑 in the Soviet Union. +

[.my2]
不出所料，这一举动引起了苏联的担忧。尼克松希望与苏联建立缓和关系，即缓和紧张局势。 1972 年 5 月，尼克松对莫斯科进行了一次同样重要的访问，以支持核武器协议。这次访问的成果是《战略武器限制条约》（SALT I）。美国和苏联承诺, 限制双方建造的洲际弹道导弹的数量，并阻止反弹道导弹系统的发展。

Anticommunism was raging (v.)发怒，怒斥；猛烈地继续，激烈进行；迅速蔓延 in the United States. +

Although the Cold War still burned hotly across the globe, the efforts of Nixon and Kissinger led to a temporary thaw (n.)解冻时期；融化季节.

[.my2]
可以说，尼克松可能是唯一能够完成这一安排的总统。反共主义在美国甚嚣尘上。美国人会对任何与苏联或中国讲和的尝试, 抱有极大的怀疑。考虑到尼克松在其早期职业生涯中作为坚定的"红色诱饵者"的声誉，没有人会挑战他的反共资格。他的提议主要被美国公众接受。尽管冷战仍在全球范围内激烈进行，但尼克松和基辛格的努力使冷战暂时解冻。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Details of illegal, unethical, and immoral acts. 其中, unethical 和 immoral  有什么区别?

chatgpt: +
“Unethical”和“immoral”虽然都涉及不道德的行为，但它们的侧重点略有不同。

- Unethical：指**违反职业道德或专业规范的行为。**通常与某个特定的职业、行业或团体的行为标准相关。例如，一个医生违反了医疗伦理，或者一个律师违反了法律职业道德，都可以称之为 unethical。
- Immoral：指**违反普遍社会道德或个人良心的行为。**它的范围更广泛，与普遍接受的道德标准和价值观有关。例如，欺骗、偷窃或伤害他人, 都被普遍认为是 immoral。

本句中, 这两个词一起使用，强调了白宫工作人员的行为, 既违反了职业道德规范，又违背了社会普遍认可的道德标准。

[.my2]
许多美国人通过向内转, 来应对当前的疾病。奇特的时尚和令人震惊的时尚，如裸奔、情绪戒指, 和宠物石头, 变得普遍。年轻的美国年轻人结束了每周的工作，到迪斯科舞厅寻求逃避。围绕“道德沦丧”的争议浮出水面，涉及到"吸毒增加"、"性行为泛滥", 和"离婚率上升"等问题。结果，一场强大的宗教运动转向政治，希望改变方向，走向更加纯真的时代。

.streak
-> 改写自 streek,快走，疾行，方言变体自 stretch,展开，伸长，来自古英语 streccan,展开，伸长。

词义"裸奔"来自一则小故事，在 1973 年，美国马里兰大学突然出现了几百人的裸奔队伍，一 个记者偶然看到了这一幕，在报道时兴奋的大叫：“They are streaking (v.) past me right now. It's an incredible sight.”原义要表达的是，“他们刚刚在我身边跑过，真是一个难以置信的画面”， 后随着这则新闻报道的播出，有意无意的就赋予了该词裸奔的含义。

.mood rings
心情戒指：一种戒指，其上的宝石或材料会随着佩戴者的体温变化而改变颜色，被认为可以反映佩戴者的心情。

.pet rock
宠物石头：一块被当作宠物般养护的石头，通常作为新奇物品购买，并以开玩笑的方式对待，仿佛它有着与真实动物一样的需求。

.turned (v.) political (a.)
动词后面可以跟形容词，这种结构并不奇怪。在英语中，有些动词（如turn, become, get, seem, appear等）后面常常跟形容词，以描述主语的状态或变化。这里的“turned”是一个连系动词（linking verb），意思是“变得”或“转变为”，后面的“political”用来描述这种变化的结果。

所以，“turned political”意为“变得政治化”或“转向政治”。

句子结构是正确的，不用担心。类似的结构还有： +
- She became angry.（她变得生气了。） +
- The sky *turned red*.（天空变红了。） +
在这些例子中，动词后面都跟了形容词来描述状态的变化。

==== Undoing a President  推翻(尼克松)总统


...By this time, the HOUSE _JUDICIARY (a.n.)司法部，司法系统；法官，审判员 COMMITTEE_ had already *drawn up* 起草 ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT 弹劾条款, and Nixon knew (v.) he did not have the votes 选票；选举；得票数 in the Senate to save his Presidency.

[.my2]
此时，众议院司法委员会已经起草了弹劾条款，尼克松知道, 他在参议院没有足够的票数, 来挽救他的总统职位。

On August 8, 1974, Nixon resigned the office, becoming the first President to do so. +

His successor, Gerald Ford, promptly awarded (v.) Nixon a full pardon 赦免；宽恕，原谅 for any crimes 犯罪 后定 he may have committed (v.)做出（错或非法的事）；犯（罪或错等） while in office. +
The press and the public *cried foul* ((n.)犯规) 抱怨,指责某事不公正或不诚实, but Ford defended (v.) his decision by insisting (v.) the nation was better served (v.) by ending (v.) the long, national nightmare.

[.my2]
1974年8月8日，尼克松辞职，成为第一位辞职的总统。他的继任者杰拉尔德·福特, 立即授予尼克松全面赦免他在任期间可能犯下的任何罪行。媒体和公众大声疾呼，但福特为自己的决定辩护，坚称结束这场漫长的全国性噩梦, 对国家更有利。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Cried foul
Cried foul 是一个习语，意思是“抱怨”或“指责某事不公正或不诚实”。 +
“The press and the public *cried foul*” 表示媒体和公众抱怨或指责福特总统对尼克松的全面赦免是不公正的。

.by #ending# (v.) the long, national nightmare  这里为什么用了 ending , 而不用 ended?
chatgpt: +
*“by ending”形成了一个介词短语，#介词(比如这里的 by)后, 要跟名词性质的词. 所以 ending 是作为"动名词"来用的.# +
而如果改成 ended 的话, 就变成是"动词"的"过去式"或"过去分词"形式了，而不是"名词性质"的名词或动名词，不能在介词“by”后面直接使用。*

网上的讲解: +
介词后面一定跟名词，当介词后面是动词的时候，我们需要让这个动词长得像名词，变成doing，那就是"动名词"。doing 拥有名词的词性，但它本身仍旧表示一个动作。例如：

- I went out *without doing* my homework。
- I’ m *against saying* anything. 我反对说话。
- She kept herself *from laughing*. 她忍住没笑。
- *After swimming* I felt cold. 游完泳我感到冷。
- He is good *at diving*. 他擅长跳水。
- He worried *about making* mistakes. 他担心犯错误。
- They’re thinking *of moving* to America. 他们想搬到美国去。
- This is a tool *for opening* tins. 这是一个开罐头的工具。
- He left *without paying* his bill. 他没有付账就走了。
- I have no experience *in teaching* English. 我没有教英语的经验。
- They escaped *by sliding* down a rope. 他们是从一根绳子上滑下来逃走的。
- I am used to waking up early. 我习惯于早起。 <- #这里, “to”后面跟的是动名词，因此“to”是作为介词，表示习惯。#

当然, 也有些介词, 后面接的宾语, 是"不定式"形式的. 如: except, but 这些介词: +

- They desired nothing *but to succeed*. 他们只想成功。 +
- They did nothing *but complain*. 他们老是一个劲地抱怨。 +

- It had no effect *except to make* him angry. 除惹他生气外，没产生任何效果。 +
- I can do everything *except cook*. 除了做饭我什么事都会做。 +

During his years in office, Nixon had *brought* a controversial  (a.)有争议的，引发争论的 end *to* the Vietnam War, opened (v.) communication 表达；交流；交际；传递 with Red China, watched NASA *put* astronauts *on* the moon, and presided (v.)主持（会议、仪式等）；担任（会议）主席 over _a healing (a.n.v.)康复；治疗；（情感创伤的）愈合 period_ in American history in the early 1970s. +
Despite these many accomplishments, _Watergate's shadow_ occludes (v.) Nixon's legacy.

[.my2]
尼克松在执政期间, 结束了有争议的越南战争，与红色中国建立了联系，见证了美国宇航局将宇航员送上月球，并在 20 世纪 70 年代初主持了美国历史上的一段治愈时期。尽管取得了如此多的成就，水门事件的阴影遮蔽了尼克松的遗产。

2.a general feeling of being ill/sick, unhappy or not satisfied, without signs of any particular problem 莫名的不适（或不快、不满等） +
SYN unease +
•a serious malaise (n.) among the staff 员工极为不满的情绪

-> 前缀 mal-常表示负面含义，来自拉丁语malus“坏的”，所以我直接归为否定前缀，如malady（疾病），malaria（疟疾）；词根aise和单词ease（安逸）同源，来自同一个古法语单词；它的字面义为“不安逸，不舒服”，所以表“身体不适”。

Now _the unemployment rate_ was nearing (v.) the dangerous ten percent line. +
Americans asked (v.) the question: what went wrong?

[.my2]
过去二十年里，通货膨胀率一直以百分之一到百分之三的速度缓慢增长，现在却飙升至两位数。自 1945 年以来，大多数年份都实现了充分就业，即失业率在 5% 或更低。现在，失业率已接近危险的 10% 线。美国人问：出了什么问题？



Economists had long held that /inflation and unemployment `系` were polar (a.)极地的；近地极的；南极（或北极）的;完全相反的；截然对立的 forces. +
High inflation meant (v.) a great deal of spending; therefore, many jobs would be created. +
Unemployment `谓` created (v.) jobless Americans *with* less money to spend; therefore, prices would stay (v.) the same /or fall (v.). +

Experts and commoners 平民 *debated* (v.) the roots of this problem *with differing (a.) opinions*.

[.my2]
*经济学家长期以来一直认为, "通货膨胀"和"失业"是处在两极的力量。"高通胀"意味着大量支出；因此，将会创造许多就业机会。"失业"导致美国人失业，可花的钱也减少了；因此，价格将保持不变或下降。令人惊讶的是，美国在 20 世纪 70 年代同时经历了"高失业率"和"高通胀"，这种现象被称为"滞胀"。专家和民众对于这个问题的根源争论不休，意见不一。*

[.my1]

One possibility was the price of oil. +
When Israel defeated its Arab neighbors in _the Yom Kippur 犹太人的赎罪日 War_ of 1973, Arab _oil producers_ 制造商 retaliated (v.)报复，复仇 against Israel's allies by leading _the ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM 石油，原油 EXPORTING COUNTRIES_ (OPEC) to enact (v.) an embargo. +

Automobiles and drivers sat (v.) in long gas lines 在长长的加油队伍中 at service stations.

[.my2]
一种可能性是石油价格。当以色列在1973年的"赎罪日战争"中, 击败其阿拉伯邻国时，阿拉伯石油生产国通过领导"石油输出国组织"（OPEC）实施禁运, 来报复以色列的盟友。由于供不应求，美国的石油价格立即飙升。汽车和司机在加油站排成了长队。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Yom Kippur
赎罪日, 是犹太人每年最神圣的日子，当天会全日禁食, 和恒常祈祷。据称是上帝透过摩西与亚伦，要求犹太人遵守的。"旧约"明载赎罪节的规定：“以色列要永远遵守下列条例。每年七月初十，以色列人, 和住在他们中间的外侨, 必须禁食，不准工作。那一天要行赎罪礼，洁净他们，使他们得以在上主面前洁净……这些条例必须永远遵守。”

.out·strip

.Automobiles and drivers sat (v.) in long gas lines at service stations.

可以翻译为：“汽车和司机在加油站排成了长队。” +
**这里的“in”表示“处于”或“在……中”的状态。**具体来说，“in long gas lines”意思是“在长长的加油队伍中”。 +
**“sat”在这里并不是字面意义上的“坐”，而是表示“等待”或“停留”，**形象地描述了汽车和司机在加油站排队的情景。 +
所以，用“in”是为了表达汽车和司机处在长长的加油队伍中的情境。

The price of _a gallon 加仑 of gasoline_ more than tripled (v.) from the 1970 to 1980.

[.my2]
石油价格独立于其他因素，例如"工人生产率下降"和"外国竞争"，这些因素导致了更高的失业率。石油价格还影响所有消费品的价格。需要用到石油生产的产品, 现在成本变得更高。任何通过卡车或飞机运输的商品, 都会将其新的成本费用, 转嫁给消费者。随着十年的发展，石油禁运被解除，但欧佩克每年都在稳步提高价格。从 1970 年到 1980 年，每加仑汽油的价格上涨了两倍多。

理查德·尼克松**试图首先通过削减政府支出来, 对抗通货膨胀，**但最终通过对整个国家实施工资和价格控制。 1974 年，杰拉尔德·福特目睹通货膨胀率飙升至 11% 以上。他发起了一场名为“立即鞭打通货膨胀”(WIN) 的大规模宣传运动，要求美国人自愿控制支出、工资要求, 和物价上涨。经济形势加上"水门事件"的幻灭，导致福特在 1976 年总统选举中, 败给吉米·卡特 (JIMMY CARTER)。

卡特尝试减税和削减开支，但在他领导下的1980年夏天，年通货膨胀率高达18%。与此同时，失业率在6%到8%之间波动。经济困境很可能是卡特在 1980 年大选中输给罗纳德·里根的决定性因素。

.Iran hostage crisis 伊朗人质危机
为1979年伊朗爆发伊斯兰革命后，"美国驻伊朗大使馆"被占领，66名美国外交官和平民被扣留为人质的危机。这场人质危机始于1979年11月4日，一直持续到1981年的1月20日，长达444天。很多人至今仍认为，这场人质危机导致了当时的美国总统吉米·卡特竞选连任失败。

数十年来，美国一直是伊朗国王"穆罕默德·礼萨·巴列维"的主要支持者。**前后八位美国总统为巴列维国王提供了大量的军事和经济援助，用以换取伊朗的石油供应，以及在中东的战略存在。**那些反对巴列维国王的人（因为他1960年代早期曾许诺自由及改革，后却食言）对于美国的做法非常反感乃至愤怒。而巴列维国王按照西方的生活方式生活，让国内的宗教保守人士十分愤怒。社会及宗教人士的不满情绪汇合在一起，最终爆发了伊朗革命将"巴列维"推翻。1979年1月他流亡国外。

美国曾想减少伊斯兰革命对自身的影响，并也曾尝试与伊朗的新政权建立关系。但是1979年10月，巴列维前往美国治疗淋巴瘤，此事激怒了伊朗的革命者。

发生人质事件后, **美国总统吉米·卡特立即对伊朗施加了经济和外交压力：终止从伊朗进口石油；一些伊朗人被美国驱逐出境；冻结大约价值80亿美元的伊朗人的在美资产。1980年4月，美国宣布与伊朗断交。**

伊朗向美国提出了一系列要求作为释放人质的条件，其中包括：遣返被废黜的国王，向伊朗做出一些外交姿态包括为此前美国在伊朗的一系列行为（特别是美国在1953年支持反对莫沙德哈的政变）道歉，并保证今后不再干涉伊朗。

虽然谈判似乎陷入胶着，但1980年7月27日巴列维国王在埃及逝世，9月不久两伊战争又爆发。此后，伊朗变得越来越希望能够解决人质危机。

而在美国方面，卡特在11月的总统竞选中败给罗纳德·里根，大部分分析家认为其在人质危机中表现出的无能是其失败的主要原因。但是也有传言说正是伊朗政府与里根的参谋团之间的非法交易，导致了人质释放时间的推迟。因为后者非常不想见到“十月惊喜”，也就是在大选开始前出现会导致选票大量流向卡特的事件出现，例如人质获释。

作为释放人质的交换条件，美国同意解冻此前所冻结的80亿美元资产，并保证不就此事起诉伊朗。1981年1月20日，就在里根的总统就职典礼后几分钟，所有的人质获释并交返美方。

2015年，52名扣押达444天的人质，每人能获得440万美元的赔偿，相当于1天赔偿近10,000美元。

=== Politics from Camelot to Watergate

Lyndon Johnson hoped to complete Kennedy's work. His Great Society plan declared a "war on poverty" that produced a glut of legislation unseen since the days of Franklin Roosevelt's Hundred Days. Welfare benefits were increased, health care costs were defrayed, and funds were allotted for cleaning the air and water, rebuilding cities, and subsidizing the arts and humanities.

A Civil Rights Act ended legal discrimination in public accommodations with regard to race.

Unfortunately for Johnson, the domestic minded president became mired in a foreign imbroglio — the war in Southeast Asia. Vietnam would taint his legislative successes and end the possibility of a second Johnson term.

By 1968, the zeal for domestic reform was squelched by an increasingly popular war. Families and friends across America were divided by the conflict. Assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy only fanned the flames, and by the end of the decade most Americans were weary of war, rioting, and political crusades — Americans sought a return to normalcy.

'''

==== Kennedy's New Frontier

Domestically, Kennedy continued in the tradition of liberal Democrats Roosevelt and Truman to some extent. He signed legislation raising the minimum wage and increasing Social Security benefits. He raised money for research into mental illness and allocated funds to develop impoverished rural areas. He showed approval for the civil rights movement by supporting James Meredith's attempt to enroll at the University of Mississippi and by ordering his Attorney General, brother Robert Kennedy, to protect the freedom riders in the South.


However, most of Kennedy's more revolutionary proposals languished in the conservative Congress. He wished to protect millions of acres of wilderness lands from developments, but the Congress refused. His efforts to provide federal funds to elementary and secondary schools were denied. His Medicare plan to provide health insurance for the nation's elderly failed to achieve the necessary support. Congress was dominated by a coalition of Republicans and conservative Southern Democrats who refused to expand the New Deal any further.

In his abbreviated Presidency, Kennedy failed to accomplish all he wanted domestically. But the ideas and proposals he supported survived his assassination. Medicare, federal support for education, and wilderness protection all became part of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society.

Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated Kennedy in November, 1963. His death provided a popular mandate for these important programs. In the tumultuous years that followed, many yearned for the happy Kennedy years — a return to Camelot.


'''


==== Lyndon Johnson's "Great Society"


Lyndon Baines Johnson moved quickly to establish himself in the office of the Presidency. Despite his conservative voting record in the Senate, Johnson soon reacquainted himself with his liberal roots. LBJ sponsored the largest reform agenda since Roosevelt's New Deal.

The aftershock of Kennedy's assassination provided a climate for Johnson to complete the unfinished work of JFK's New Frontier. He had eleven months before the election of 1964 to prove to American voters that he deserved a chance to be President in his own right.

Two very important pieces of legislation were passed. First, the Civil Rights Bill that JFK promised to sign was passed into law. The Civil Rights Act banned discrimination based on race and gender in employment and ending segregation in all public facilities.


Johnson also signed the omnibus ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 1964. The law created the Office of Economic Opportunity aimed at attacking the roots of American poverty. A Job Corps was established to provide valuable vocational training.

Head Start, a preschool program designed to help disadvantaged students arrive at kindergarten ready to learn was put into place. The VOLUNTEERS IN SERVICE TO AMERICA (VISTA) was set up as a domestic Peace Corps. Schools in impoverished American regions would now receive volunteer teaching attention. Federal funds were sent to struggling communities to attack unemployment and illiteracy.

As he campaigned in 1964, Johnson declared a "war on poverty." He challenged Americans to build a "Great Society" that eliminated the troubles of the poor. Johnson won a decisive victory over his archconservative Republican opponent Barry Goldwater of Arizona.

American liberalism was at high tide under President Johnson.

- The Wilderness Protection Act saved 9.1 million acres of forestland from industrial development.

- The Elementary and Secondary Education Act provided major funding for American public schools.

- The Voting Rights Act banned literacy tests and other discriminatory methods of denying suffrage to African Americans.

- Medicare was created to offset the costs of health care for the nation's elderly.

- The National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities used public money to fund artists and galleries.

- The Immigration Act ended discriminatory quotas based on ethnic origin.

- An Omnibus Housing Act provided funds to construct low-income housing.

- Congress tightened pollution controls with stronger Air and Water Quality Acts.

- Standards were raised for safety in consumer products.

Lyndon B. Johnson signs Civil Rights Act
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was part of Lyndon B. Johnson's "Great Society" reform package — the largest social improvement agenda by a President since FDR's "New Deal."

Johnson was an accomplished legislator and used his connections in Congress and forceful personality to pass his agenda.

By 1966, Johnson was pleased with the progress he had made. But soon events in Southeast Asia began to overshadow his domestic achievements. Funds he had envisioned to fight his war on poverty were now diverted to the war in Vietnam. He found himself maligned by conservatives for his domestic policies and by liberals for his hawkish stance on Vietnam.



By 1968, his hopes of leaving a legacy of domestic reform were in serious jeopardy.

==== Triangular Diplomacy: U.S., USSR, and China

predecessor, RICHARD NIXON longed to be known for his expertise in FOREIGN POLICY. Although occupied with the Vietnam War, Nixon also initiated several new trends in American diplomatic relations. Nixon contended that the communist world consisted of two rival powers — the Soviet Union and China. Given the long history of animosity between those two nations, Nixon and his adviser HENRY KISSINGER, decided to exploit that rivalry to win advantages for the United States. That policy became known as triangular diplomacy.

As President Nixon's national security adviser, Henry Kissinger made a secret trip to arrange the first-ever Presidential visit to China in 1972. He would become Nixon's secretary of state the next year.

As expected, this maneuver caused concern in the Soviet Union. Nixon hoped to establish a DÉTENTE, or an easing of tensions, with the USSR. In May 1972, Nixon made an equally significant trip to Moscow to support a nuclear arms agreement. The product of this visit was the STRATEGIC ARMS LIMITATION TREATY (SALT I). The United States and the Soviet Union pledged to limit the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles each side would build, and to prevent the development of anti-ballistic missile systems.


Arguably, Nixon may have been the only president who could have accomplished this arrangement. Anticommunism was raging in the United States. Americans would view with great suspicion any attempts to make peace with either the Soviet Union or China. No one would challenge Nixon's anticommunist credentials, given his reputation as a staunch red-baiter in his early career. His overtures were chiefly accepted by the American public. Although the Cold War still burned hotly across the globe, the efforts of Nixon and Kissinger led to a temporary thaw.


'''

=== Shaping a New America

As awareness was being raised across America about civil rights for African Americans, it was only natural that other groups who felt marginalized by the American mainstream to make demands of their own. Not since the drive for suffrage had a drive for women's rights met with much success. A new FEMINIST MOVEMENT emerged in the 1960s pressing for modern reforms.

With few exceptions, women were excluded from the highest paying jobs, earning only a fraction of the wages of their male counterparts. The 1950s cult of the housewife discouraged women from holding full-time jobs and from seeking higher degrees. The call for legality and availability of birth control options like the pill galvanized many of feminists. Eventually, the right to obtain a safe, legal abortion became a new milestone. These demands and others led to the proposal of an Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution, which would forever ban sex discrimination in the nation's laws and practices.



LATINO AMERICANS and NATIVE AMERICANS had also languished in the bottom economic strata throughout much of the prosperous 1950s. Radical and moderate ethnic leaders organized to close this gap. By the end of the decade, the time was ripe for gay Americans to demand equality as well. The politics of identity dominated America as these and other disadvantaged American groups found their voices of protest.

Another battle cry was sounded to save the planet from environmental destruction. Toxic emissions, deadly pesticides, and fears of nuclear holocaust brought many concerned Americans together in the earth awareness movement. This time "GREEN" ACTIVISTS went beyond conservation of resources to demand regulation of economic activities that could hurt the nation's environment.

In the 1960s, the first baby boomers entered college. These students were the largest class of young Americans ever to enter the halls of ivy. Unlike the "Silent Generation" of 1950s youth, the baby boomers were vocal about reforming democracy in the United States and the American presence abroad. College administrators were confronted with inspired students requesting reforms of the core academic curriculum, greater opportunities for free speech, and more relaxed college rules. A small, but highly visible segment of students withdrew from the mainstream and created a counterculture with profound impact on American values, fashion, and music.


'''

=== A Time of Malaise  不适的时期 (1970年代)

Something was terribly wrong in America in the 1970s.

The United States was supposed to be a superpower, yet American forces proved powerless to stop a tiny guerrilla force in Vietnam. Support for Israel in the Middle East led to a rash of terrorism against American citizens traveling abroad, as well a punitive oil embargo that stifled the economy and forced American motorists to wait hours for their next tank of gasoline.

A hostile new government in Iran held fifty-two American citizens hostage before the eyes of the incredulous world. The détente with the Soviet Union of the Nixon years dissolved into bitter animosity when a second arms control agreement failed in the Senate and a Soviet army of invasion marched into Afghanistan. The United States military juggernaut seemed to have reached its limits.



At home, the news was no better. The worst political scandal in United States history forced a president to resign before facing certain impeachment. Months of investigation turned into years of untangling a web of government deceit. Details of illegal, unethical, and immoral acts by members of the White House staff covered the nation's newspapers. Upon resignation, the president was granted a full and complete pardon. Many Americans wondered what happened to justice and accountability.

The booming economy sputtered to a halt. Inflation approached 20% and unemployment neared 10% — a combination previously thought to be impossible. Crime rates rose as tales of the decaying inner cities fell on deaf ears. A nuclear disaster of unspeakable proportions was barely averted at the Three Mile Island fission plant in Pennsylvania.



Many Americans coped with the current ailments by turning inward. Outlandish fashion and outrageous fads such as streaking, mood rings, and pet rocks became common. Younger Americans finished their workweeks and sought escape in discotheques. Controversy surrounding "DECAYING MORALITY" surfaced with regard to increased drug use, sexual promiscuity, and a rising divorce rate. As a result, a powerful religious movement turned political in the hopes of changing directions toward a more innocent time.

The United States celebrated its bicentennial anniversary in 1976 without the expected accompanying optimism. Instead, while many reflected on the past laurels of American success, an overarching question was on the minds of the American people: what had gone wrong?

'''

==== Undoing a President


...By this time, the HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE had already drawn up ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT, and Nixon knew he did not have the votes in the Senate to save his Presidency.

On August 8, 1974, Nixon resigned the office, becoming the first President to do so. His successor, Gerald Ford, promptly awarded Nixon a full pardon for any crimes he may have committed while in office. The press and the public cried foul, but Ford defended his decision by insisting the nation was better served by ending the long, national nightmare.

During his years in office, Nixon had brought a controversial end to the Vietnam War, opened communication with Red China, watched NASA put astronauts on the moon, and presided over a healing period in American history in the early 1970s. Despite these many accomplishments, Watergate's shadow occludes Nixon's legacy.

'''

==== The Sickened Economy


Malaise Noun. 1) An indefinite feeling of debility or lack of health. 2) A vague sense of mental or moral ill-being.

People can feel malaise. Nations can feel malaise. Economies can feel malaise. In the mid-1970s much of America suffered a collective MALAISE.

Nothing fuels a strong case of malaise like a sputtering economy. The United States had grown accustomed to steady economic growth since the end of World War II. Recessions were short and were followed by robust economic growth. For the first time since the Great Depression, Americans faced an economy that could result in a lower standard of living for their children.

Inflation, which crept along at one to three percent for the previous two decades, exploded into double digits. Full employment, defined as unemployment rates of five percent or less, had been achieved in most years since 1945. Now the unemployment rate was nearing the dangerous ten percent line. Americans asked the question: what went wrong?



Economists had long held that inflation and unemployment were polar forces. High inflation meant a great deal of spending; therefore, many jobs would be created. Unemployment created jobless Americans with less money to spend; therefore, prices would stay the same or fall. Surprisingly, the United States experienced high unemployment and high inflation simultaneously in the 1970s — a phenomenon called stagflation. Experts and commoners debated the roots of this problem with differing opinions.

One possibility was the price of oil. When Israel defeated its Arab neighbors in the Yom Kippur War of 1973, Arab oil producers retaliated against Israel's allies by leading the ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC) to enact an embargo. Oil prices skyrocketed immediately in the United States as the demand outstripped the supply. Automobiles and drivers sat in long gas lines at service stations.

The price of oil is independent of other factors such as falling worker productivity and foreign competition, which led to greater unemployment. Oil prices also influence the prices of all consumer goods. Products that require oil to produce would now cost more. Any commodity shipped by truck or airplane would pass its new expenses off to the consumer. As the decade progressed, the embargo was lifted, but OPEC steadily raised prices each year. The price of a gallon of gasoline more than tripled from the 1970 to 1980.

Richard Nixon tried to fight inflation first by cutting government spending, but ultimately by imposing wage and price controls on the entire nation. GERALD FORD watched the inflation rate soar above 11 percent in 1974. He enacted a huge propaganda campaign called WHIP INFLATION NOW (WIN), which asked Americans to voluntarily control spending, wage demands, and price increases. The economy, along with Watergate disillusionment, led Ford to suffer defeat at the hands of JIMMY CARTER in the 1976 Presidential election.



Carter tried tax and spending cuts, but the annual inflation rate topped 18 percent under his watch in the summer of 1980. At the same time, the unemployment rate fluctuated between 6 and 8 percent. Economic woes may well have been the decisive factor in Carter's defeat to Ronald Reagan in the election of 1980.


'''

==== Foreign Woes

America sank deeper into malaise when it looked around at what was going on in the rest of the world.

The decade began with America's longest war ending in its first decisive military defeat in its 200-year-history. Diplomacy seemed powerless to stop the economic dependence of the United States on the volatile Middle East for a steady supply of oil. Terrorists from this region and others threatened heads of state and ordinary citizens around the globe. Despite an auspicious start, relations with the Soviet Union deteriorated by the end of the decade.



Terrorism was on the rise around the globe. The world watched in horror as Arab gunmen cut down eleven Israeli weightlifters at the 1972 OLYMPICS in Munich. The IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY (IRA) killed thousands of English and Irish citizens attempting to receive recognition for their cause — an independent homeland. Americans began to see the world slipping into anarchy and felt powerless to fix the problem.

In 1979, the new Islamic fundamentalist government of Iran captured 52 Americans at the US Embassy in TEHRAN. They demanded the return of their former leader, SHAH MOHAMMED REZA PAHLAVI, to Iran in exchange for the lives of the hostages. For 444 days, Americans watched helplessly as their fellow citizens were held in confinement. A rescue effort ordered by President Carter crashed in the desert in April 1980.




Malaise, malaise, malaise.


One exception to these negative trends was the CAMP DAVID AGREEMENT, brokered by Carter in 1978. These accords resulted in the mutual recognition of Israel and Egypt, a giant first step toward a lasting peace.



But the U.S.-USSR détente arranged by Nixon and Kissinger was crumbling by the end of the decade. A second arms limitation treaty between the superpowers known as SALT II was delivered to the Senate — only to be rejected. The USSR had surpassed the United States in nuclear warheads. The Cold War became frostier.



A Marxist revolution in NICARAGUA brought greater fears of communism spreading to the Western Hemisphere. Finally, in 1979 the Soviet Union invaded AFGHANISTAN with combat troops from the Red Army. Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev promised that Afghani leaders had requested military assistance, but American diplomats were dubious.



Fearing Soviet expansion into the Middle East, the Carter Administration strongly condemned the action and levied a wheat boycott on the Soviet Union. The 1980 OLYMPIC GAMES held in Moscow were boycotted by the United States.

America's claim to dominant status in the world had been seriously challenged, by the end of the 1970s.

So, Americans started looking inward, inside themselves, in the hope of feeling better.
