在国内，肯尼迪在一定程度上延续了自由民主党人罗斯福和杜鲁门的传统。他签署了提高最低工资, 和增加社会保障福利的立法。他筹集资金用于精神疾病研究，并拨款发展贫困农村地区。他支持詹姆斯·梅雷迪思进入密西西比大学就读，并命令他的当司法部长弟弟罗伯特·肯尼迪, 保护南方的自由乘车者，这表明了他对民权运动的认可。

[.my2]
然而，肯尼迪的大多数更具革命性的提议, 在保守的"国会"中都受到了冷落。他希望保护数百万英亩的荒地免遭开发，但国会拒绝了。他为中小学提供联邦资金的努力, 遭到拒绝。他为全国老年人提供健康保险的医疗保险计划, 未能获得必要的支持。国会由"共和党"和"保守的南方民主党"联盟主导，他们拒绝进一步扩大"新政"。

==== Triangular (a.)三角的，三角形的 Diplomacy: U.S., USSR, and China

Although occupied with the Vietnam War, Nixon also initiated several new trends in American diplomatic relations. +

Given 考虑到；鉴于 the long history of animosity (n.)憎恶，仇恨，敌意 between those two nations, Nixon and his adviser HENRY KISSINGER 基辛格, decided to exploit (v.)利用（…为自己谋利） that rivalry (n.)竞争，较量 to win (v.) advantages for the United States. +
That policy became known as triangular diplomacy.

[.my2]
**与他的前任不同，理查德·尼克松渴望以其在"外交政策"方面的专业知识而闻名。**尽管忙于越南战争，尼克松也开创了美国外交关系的几个新趋势。*尼克松认为，共产主义世界由两个敌对大国组成——苏联和中国。鉴于这两个国家之间长期以来的敌对历史，尼克松和他的顾问亨利·基辛格决定利用这种竞争, 为美国赢得优势。这项政策被称为"三角外交"。*

As President Nixon's _national security adviser_, Henry Kissinger made a secret trip to arrange (v.)安排，筹备 the first-ever (a.)首次的，前所未有的 Presidential visit to China in 1972. +
He would become Nixon's _secretary of state_ 国务卿 the next year.

[.my2]
作为尼克松总统的国家安全顾问，亨利·基辛格于1972年秘密出访，安排总统首次访华。次年他就任尼克松的国务卿。

As expected 正如所料, this maneuver 细致巧妙的移动，机动动作；策略，手段 caused (v.) concern  担心，忧虑 in the Soviet Union. +

The United States and the Soviet Union pledged (v.)保证给予（或做）；正式承诺 to limit (v.) the number of _intercontinental 洲际的；大陆间的 ballistic (a.)弹道的；射击的 missiles_ 后定 each side would build, and to prevent the development of anti-ballistic missile systems.

[.my2]
不出所料，这一举动引起了苏联的担忧。尼克松希望与苏联建立缓和关系，即缓和紧张局势。 1972 年 5 月，尼克松对莫斯科进行了一次同样重要的访问，以支持核武器协议。这次访问的成果是《战略武器限制条约》（SALT I）。美国和苏联承诺, 限制双方建造的洲际弹道导弹的数量，并阻止反弹道导弹系统的发展。

Anticommunism was raging (v.)发怒，怒斥；猛烈地继续，激烈进行；迅速蔓延 in the United States. +

Although the Cold War still burned hotly across the globe, the efforts of Nixon and Kissinger led to a temporary thaw (n.)解冻时期；融化季节.

[.my2]
可以说，尼克松可能是唯一能够完成这一安排的总统。反共主义在美国甚嚣尘上。美国人会对任何与苏联或中国讲和的尝试, 抱有极大的怀疑。考虑到尼克松在其早期职业生涯中作为坚定的"红色诱饵者"的声誉，没有人会挑战他的反共资格。他的提议主要被美国公众接受。尽管冷战仍在全球范围内激烈进行，但尼克松和基辛格的努力使冷战暂时解冻。

=== A Time of Malaise  不适的时期 (1970年代)

Something was terribly wrong in America in the 1970s.

[.my2]
20 世纪 70 年代的美国出现了严重问题。

The United States was supposed to be a superpower, yet American forces proved powerless to stop a tiny guerrilla force in Vietnam. +
Support for Israel in the Middle East led to a rash of terrorism against American citizens traveling abroad, as well a punitive oil embargo that stifled the economy and forced American motorists to wait hours for their next tank of gasoline.

[.my2]
美国本应是一个超级大国，但事实证明，美国军队无力阻止越南的一支小规模游击队。中东对以色列的支持, 导致了针对出国旅行的美国公民的一系列恐怖主义活动，以及惩罚性的石油禁运，扼杀了经济，迫使美国驾车者等待数小时才能获得下一箱汽油。

A hostile new government in Iran held fifty-two American citizens hostage before the eyes of the incredulous world. +
The détente with the Soviet Union of the Nixon years dissolved into bitter animosity when a second arms control agreement failed in the Senate and a Soviet army of invasion marched into Afghanistan. +
The United States military juggernaut seemed to have reached its limits.

[.my2]

During his years in office, Nixon had brought a controversial end to the Vietnam War, opened communication with Red China, watched NASA put astronauts on the moon, and presided over a healing period in American history in the early 1970s. +
Despite these many accomplishments, Watergate's shadow occludes Nixon's legacy.

过去二十年里，通货膨胀率一直以百分之一到百分之三的速度缓慢增长，现在却飙升至两位数。自 1945 年以来，大多数年份都实现了充分就业，即失业率在 5% 或更低。现在，失业率已接近危险的 10% 线。美国人问：出了什么问题？



Economists had long held that inflation and unemployment were polar forces. +
High inflation meant a great deal of spending; therefore, many jobs would be created. +
Unemployment created jobless Americans with less money to spend; therefore, prices would stay the same or fall. +
Surprisingly, the United States experienced high unemployment and high inflation simultaneously in the 1970s — a phenomenon called stagflation. +
Experts and commoners debated the roots of this problem with differing opinions.

[.my2]
*经济学家长期以来一直认为, "通货膨胀"和"失业"是处在两极的力量。"高通胀"意味着大量支出；因此，将会创造许多就业机会。"失业"导致美国人失业，可花的钱也减少了；因此，价格将保持不变或下降。令人惊讶的是，美国在 20 世纪 70 年代同时经历了"高失业率"和"高通胀"，这种现象被称为"滞胀"。专家和民众对于这个问题的根源争论不休，意见不一。*

理查德·尼克松**试图首先通过削减政府支出来, 对抗通货膨胀，**但最终通过对整个国家实施工资和价格控制。 1974 年，杰拉尔德·福特目睹通货膨胀率飙升至 11% 以上。他发起了一场名为“立即鞭打通货膨胀”(WIN) 的大规模宣传运动，要求美国人自愿控制支出、工资要求, 和物价上涨。经济形势加上"水门事件"的幻灭，导致福特在 1976 年总统选举中, 败给吉米·卡特 (JIMMY CARTER)。



Carter tried tax and spending cuts, but the annual inflation rate topped 18 percent under his watch in the summer of 1980. +
At the same time, the unemployment rate fluctuated between 6 and 8 percent. +

.Iran hostage crisis 伊朗人质危机
为1979年伊朗爆发伊斯兰革命后，"美国驻伊朗大使馆"被占领，66名美国外交官和平民被扣留为人质的危机。这场人质危机始于1979年11月4日，一直持续到1981年的1月20日，长达444天。很多人至今仍认为，这场人质危机导致了当时的美国总统吉米·卡特竞选连任失败。

数十年来，美国一直是伊朗国王"穆罕默德·礼萨·巴列维"的主要支持者。**前后八位美国总统为巴列维国王提供了大量的军事和经济援助，用以换取伊朗的石油供应，以及在中东的战略存在。**那些反对巴列维国王的人（因为他1960年代早期曾许诺自由及改革，后却食言）对于美国的做法非常反感乃至愤怒。而巴列维国王按照西方的生活方式生活，让国内的宗教保守人士十分愤怒。社会及宗教人士的不满情绪汇合在一起，最终爆发了伊朗革命将"巴列维"推翻。1979年1月他流亡国外。

美国曾想减少伊斯兰革命对自身的影响，并也曾尝试与伊朗的新政权建立关系。但是1979年10月，巴列维前往美国治疗淋巴瘤，此事激怒了伊朗的革命者。

发生人质事件后, **美国总统吉米·卡特立即对伊朗施加了经济和外交压力：终止从伊朗进口石油；一些伊朗人被美国驱逐出境；冻结大约价值80亿美元的伊朗人的在美资产。1980年4月，美国宣布与伊朗断交。**

伊朗向美国提出了一系列要求作为释放人质的条件，其中包括：遣返被废黜的国王，向伊朗做出一些外交姿态包括为此前美国在伊朗的一系列行为（特别是美国在1953年支持反对莫沙德哈的政变）道歉，并保证今后不再干涉伊朗。

虽然谈判似乎陷入胶着，但1980年7月27日巴列维国王在埃及逝世，9月不久两伊战争又爆发。此后，伊朗变得越来越希望能够解决人质危机。

而在美国方面，卡特在11月的总统竞选中败给罗纳德·里根，大部分分析家认为其在人质危机中表现出的无能是其失败的主要原因。但是也有传言说正是伊朗政府与里根的参谋团之间的非法交易，导致了人质释放时间的推迟。因为后者非常不想见到“十月惊喜”，也就是在大选开始前出现会导致选票大量流向卡特的事件出现，例如人质获释。

作为释放人质的交换条件，美国同意解冻此前所冻结的80亿美元资产，并保证不就此事起诉伊朗。1981年1月20日，就在里根的总统就职典礼后几分钟，所有的人质获释并交返美方。

2015年，52名扣押达444天的人质，每人能获得440万美元的赔偿，相当于1天赔偿近10,000美元。

=== Politics from Camelot to Watergate

Lyndon Johnson hoped to complete Kennedy's work. His Great Society plan declared a "war on poverty" that produced a glut of legislation unseen since the days of Franklin Roosevelt's Hundred Days. Welfare benefits were increased, health care costs were defrayed, and funds were allotted for cleaning the air and water, rebuilding cities, and subsidizing the arts and humanities.

A Civil Rights Act ended legal discrimination in public accommodations with regard to race.

Unfortunately for Johnson, the domestic minded president became mired in a foreign imbroglio — the war in Southeast Asia. Vietnam would taint his legislative successes and end the possibility of a second Johnson term.

By 1968, the zeal for domestic reform was squelched by an increasingly popular war. Families and friends across America were divided by the conflict. Assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy only fanned the flames, and by the end of the decade most Americans were weary of war, rioting, and political crusades — Americans sought a return to normalcy.

'''

==== Kennedy's New Frontier

Domestically, Kennedy continued in the tradition of liberal Democrats Roosevelt and Truman to some extent. He signed legislation raising the minimum wage and increasing Social Security benefits. He raised money for research into mental illness and allocated funds to develop impoverished rural areas. He showed approval for the civil rights movement by supporting James Meredith's attempt to enroll at the University of Mississippi and by ordering his Attorney General, brother Robert Kennedy, to protect the freedom riders in the South.


However, most of Kennedy's more revolutionary proposals languished in the conservative Congress. He wished to protect millions of acres of wilderness lands from developments, but the Congress refused. His efforts to provide federal funds to elementary and secondary schools were denied. His Medicare plan to provide health insurance for the nation's elderly failed to achieve the necessary support. Congress was dominated by a coalition of Republicans and conservative Southern Democrats who refused to expand the New Deal any further.

In his abbreviated Presidency, Kennedy failed to accomplish all he wanted domestically. But the ideas and proposals he supported survived his assassination. Medicare, federal support for education, and wilderness protection all became part of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society.

Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated Kennedy in November, 1963. His death provided a popular mandate for these important programs. In the tumultuous years that followed, many yearned for the happy Kennedy years — a return to Camelot.


'''


==== Lyndon Johnson's "Great Society"


Lyndon Baines Johnson moved quickly to establish himself in the office of the Presidency. Despite his conservative voting record in the Senate, Johnson soon reacquainted himself with his liberal roots. LBJ sponsored the largest reform agenda since Roosevelt's New Deal.

The aftershock of Kennedy's assassination provided a climate for Johnson to complete the unfinished work of JFK's New Frontier. He had eleven months before the election of 1964 to prove to American voters that he deserved a chance to be President in his own right.

Two very important pieces of legislation were passed. First, the Civil Rights Bill that JFK promised to sign was passed into law. The Civil Rights Act banned discrimination based on race and gender in employment and ending segregation in all public facilities.


Johnson also signed the omnibus ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 1964. The law created the Office of Economic Opportunity aimed at attacking the roots of American poverty. A Job Corps was established to provide valuable vocational training.

Head Start, a preschool program designed to help disadvantaged students arrive at kindergarten ready to learn was put into place. The VOLUNTEERS IN SERVICE TO AMERICA (VISTA) was set up as a domestic Peace Corps. Schools in impoverished American regions would now receive volunteer teaching attention. Federal funds were sent to struggling communities to attack unemployment and illiteracy.

As he campaigned in 1964, Johnson declared a "war on poverty." He challenged Americans to build a "Great Society" that eliminated the troubles of the poor. Johnson won a decisive victory over his archconservative Republican opponent Barry Goldwater of Arizona.

American liberalism was at high tide under President Johnson.

- The Wilderness Protection Act saved 9.1 million acres of forestland from industrial development.

- The Elementary and Secondary Education Act provided major funding for American public schools.

- The Voting Rights Act banned literacy tests and other discriminatory methods of denying suffrage to African Americans.

- Medicare was created to offset the costs of health care for the nation's elderly.

- The National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities used public money to fund artists and galleries.

- The Immigration Act ended discriminatory quotas based on ethnic origin.

- An Omnibus Housing Act provided funds to construct low-income housing.

- Congress tightened pollution controls with stronger Air and Water Quality Acts.

- Standards were raised for safety in consumer products.

Lyndon B. Johnson signs Civil Rights Act
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was part of Lyndon B. Johnson's "Great Society" reform package — the largest social improvement agenda by a President since FDR's "New Deal."

Johnson was an accomplished legislator and used his connections in Congress and forceful personality to pass his agenda.

By 1966, Johnson was pleased with the progress he had made. But soon events in Southeast Asia began to overshadow his domestic achievements. Funds he had envisioned to fight his war on poverty were now diverted to the war in Vietnam. He found himself maligned by conservatives for his domestic policies and by liberals for his hawkish stance on Vietnam.



By 1968, his hopes of leaving a legacy of domestic reform were in serious jeopardy.



'''

==== Triangular Diplomacy: U.S., USSR, and China

predecessor, RICHARD NIXON longed to be known for his expertise in FOREIGN POLICY. Although occupied with the Vietnam War, Nixon also initiated several new trends in American diplomatic relations. Nixon contended that the communist world consisted of two rival powers — the Soviet Union and China. Given the long history of animosity between those two nations, Nixon and his adviser HENRY KISSINGER, decided to exploit that rivalry to win advantages for the United States. That policy became known as triangular diplomacy.

As President Nixon's national security adviser, Henry Kissinger made a secret trip to arrange the first-ever Presidential visit to China in 1972. He would become Nixon's secretary of state the next year.

As expected, this maneuver caused concern in the Soviet Union. Nixon hoped to establish a DÉTENTE, or an easing of tensions, with the USSR. In May 1972, Nixon made an equally significant trip to Moscow to support a nuclear arms agreement. The product of this visit was the STRATEGIC ARMS LIMITATION TREATY (SALT I). The United States and the Soviet Union pledged to limit the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles each side would build, and to prevent the development of anti-ballistic missile systems.


Arguably, Nixon may have been the only president who could have accomplished this arrangement. Anticommunism was raging in the United States. Americans would view with great suspicion any attempts to make peace with either the Soviet Union or China. No one would challenge Nixon's anticommunist credentials, given his reputation as a staunch red-baiter in his early career. His overtures were chiefly accepted by the American public. Although the Cold War still burned hotly across the globe, the efforts of Nixon and Kissinger led to a temporary thaw.


'''

=== Shaping a New America

As awareness was being raised across America about civil rights for African Americans, it was only natural that other groups who felt marginalized by the American mainstream to make demands of their own. Not since the drive for suffrage had a drive for women's rights met with much success. A new FEMINIST MOVEMENT emerged in the 1960s pressing for modern reforms.

With few exceptions, women were excluded from the highest paying jobs, earning only a fraction of the wages of their male counterparts. The 1950s cult of the housewife discouraged women from holding full-time jobs and from seeking higher degrees. The call for legality and availability of birth control options like the pill galvanized many of feminists. Eventually, the right to obtain a safe, legal abortion became a new milestone. These demands and others led to the proposal of an Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution, which would forever ban sex discrimination in the nation's laws and practices.



LATINO AMERICANS and NATIVE AMERICANS had also languished in the bottom economic strata throughout much of the prosperous 1950s. Radical and moderate ethnic leaders organized to close this gap. By the end of the decade, the time was ripe for gay Americans to demand equality as well. The politics of identity dominated America as these and other disadvantaged American groups found their voices of protest.

Another battle cry was sounded to save the planet from environmental destruction. Toxic emissions, deadly pesticides, and fears of nuclear holocaust brought many concerned Americans together in the earth awareness movement. This time "GREEN" ACTIVISTS went beyond conservation of resources to demand regulation of economic activities that could hurt the nation's environment.

In the 1960s, the first baby boomers entered college. These students were the largest class of young Americans ever to enter the halls of ivy. Unlike the "Silent Generation" of 1950s youth, the baby boomers were vocal about reforming democracy in the United States and the American presence abroad. College administrators were confronted with inspired students requesting reforms of the core academic curriculum, greater opportunities for free speech, and more relaxed college rules. A small, but highly visible segment of students withdrew from the mainstream and created a counterculture with profound impact on American values, fashion, and music.


'''

=== A Time of Malaise  不适的时期 (1970年代)

Something was terribly wrong in America in the 1970s.

The United States was supposed to be a superpower, yet American forces proved powerless to stop a tiny guerrilla force in Vietnam. Support for Israel in the Middle East led to a rash of terrorism against American citizens traveling abroad, as well a punitive oil embargo that stifled the economy and forced American motorists to wait hours for their next tank of gasoline.

A hostile new government in Iran held fifty-two American citizens hostage before the eyes of the incredulous world. The détente with the Soviet Union of the Nixon years dissolved into bitter animosity when a second arms control agreement failed in the Senate and a Soviet army of invasion marched into Afghanistan. The United States military juggernaut seemed to have reached its limits.



At home, the news was no better. The worst political scandal in United States history forced a president to resign before facing certain impeachment. Months of investigation turned into years of untangling a web of government deceit. Details of illegal, unethical, and immoral acts by members of the White House staff covered the nation's newspapers. Upon resignation, the president was granted a full and complete pardon. Many Americans wondered what happened to justice and accountability.

The booming economy sputtered to a halt. Inflation approached 20% and unemployment neared 10% — a combination previously thought to be impossible. Crime rates rose as tales of the decaying inner cities fell on deaf ears. A nuclear disaster of unspeakable proportions was barely averted at the Three Mile Island fission plant in Pennsylvania.



Many Americans coped with the current ailments by turning inward. Outlandish fashion and outrageous fads such as streaking, mood rings, and pet rocks became common. Younger Americans finished their workweeks and sought escape in discotheques. Controversy surrounding "DECAYING MORALITY" surfaced with regard to increased drug use, sexual promiscuity, and a rising divorce rate. As a result, a powerful religious movement turned political in the hopes of changing directions toward a more innocent time.

The United States celebrated its bicentennial anniversary in 1976 without the expected accompanying optimism. Instead, while many reflected on the past laurels of American success, an overarching question was on the minds of the American people: what had gone wrong?

'''

==== Undoing a President


...By this time, the HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE had already drawn up ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT, and Nixon knew he did not have the votes in the Senate to save his Presidency.

On August 8, 1974, Nixon resigned the office, becoming the first President to do so. His successor, Gerald Ford, promptly awarded Nixon a full pardon for any crimes he may have committed while in office. The press and the public cried foul, but Ford defended his decision by insisting the nation was better served by ending the long, national nightmare.

During his years in office, Nixon had brought a controversial end to the Vietnam War, opened communication with Red China, watched NASA put astronauts on the moon, and presided over a healing period in American history in the early 1970s. Despite these many accomplishments, Watergate's shadow occludes Nixon's legacy.

==== The Sickened Economy


Malaise Noun. 1) An indefinite feeling of debility or lack of health. 2) A vague sense of mental or moral ill-being.

People can feel malaise. Nations can feel malaise. Economies can feel malaise. In the mid-1970s much of America suffered a collective MALAISE.

Nothing fuels a strong case of malaise like a sputtering economy. The United States had grown accustomed to steady economic growth since the end of World War II. Recessions were short and were followed by robust economic growth. For the first time since the Great Depression, Americans faced an economy that could result in a lower standard of living for their children.

Inflation, which crept along at one to three percent for the previous two decades, exploded into double digits. Full employment, defined as unemployment rates of five percent or less, had been achieved in most years since 1945. Now the unemployment rate was nearing the dangerous ten percent line. Americans asked the question: what went wrong?



Economists had long held that inflation and unemployment were polar forces. High inflation meant a great deal of spending; therefore, many jobs would be created. Unemployment created jobless Americans with less money to spend; therefore, prices would stay the same or fall. Surprisingly, the United States experienced high unemployment and high inflation simultaneously in the 1970s — a phenomenon called stagflation. Experts and commoners debated the roots of this problem with differing opinions.

One possibility was the price of oil. When Israel defeated its Arab neighbors in the Yom Kippur War of 1973, Arab oil producers retaliated against Israel's allies by leading the ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC) to enact an embargo. Oil prices skyrocketed immediately in the United States as the demand outstripped the supply. Automobiles and drivers sat in long gas lines at service stations.

The price of oil is independent of other factors such as falling worker productivity and foreign competition, which led to greater unemployment. Oil prices also influence the prices of all consumer goods. Products that require oil to produce would now cost more. Any commodity shipped by truck or airplane would pass its new expenses off to the consumer. As the decade progressed, the embargo was lifted, but OPEC steadily raised prices each year. The price of a gallon of gasoline more than tripled from the 1970 to 1980.

Richard Nixon tried to fight inflation first by cutting government spending, but ultimately by imposing wage and price controls on the entire nation. GERALD FORD watched the inflation rate soar above 11 percent in 1974. He enacted a huge propaganda campaign called WHIP INFLATION NOW (WIN), which asked Americans to voluntarily control spending, wage demands, and price increases. The economy, along with Watergate disillusionment, led Ford to suffer defeat at the hands of JIMMY CARTER in the 1976 Presidential election.



Carter tried tax and spending cuts, but the annual inflation rate topped 18 percent under his watch in the summer of 1980. At the same time, the unemployment rate fluctuated between 6 and 8 percent. Economic woes may well have been the decisive factor in Carter's defeat to Ronald Reagan in the election of 1980.

==== Foreign Woes

America sank deeper into malaise when it looked around at what was going on in the rest of the world.

The decade began with America's longest war ending in its first decisive military defeat in its 200-year-history. Diplomacy seemed powerless to stop the economic dependence of the United States on the volatile Middle East for a steady supply of oil. Terrorists from this region and others threatened heads of state and ordinary citizens around the globe. Despite an auspicious start, relations with the Soviet Union deteriorated by the end of the decade.



Terrorism was on the rise around the globe. The world watched in horror as Arab gunmen cut down eleven Israeli weightlifters at the 1972 OLYMPICS in Munich. The IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY (IRA) killed thousands of English and Irish citizens attempting to receive recognition for their cause — an independent homeland. Americans began to see the world slipping into anarchy and felt powerless to fix the problem.

In 1979, the new Islamic fundamentalist government of Iran captured 52 Americans at the US Embassy in TEHRAN. They demanded the return of their former leader, SHAH MOHAMMED REZA PAHLAVI, to Iran in exchange for the lives of the hostages. For 444 days, Americans watched helplessly as their fellow citizens were held in confinement. A rescue effort ordered by President Carter crashed in the desert in April 1980.




Malaise, malaise, malaise.


One exception to these negative trends was the CAMP DAVID AGREEMENT, brokered by Carter in 1978. These accords resulted in the mutual recognition of Israel and Egypt, a giant first step toward a lasting peace.



But the U.S.-USSR détente arranged by Nixon and Kissinger was crumbling by the end of the decade. A second arms limitation treaty between the superpowers known as SALT II was delivered to the Senate — only to be rejected. The USSR had surpassed the United States in nuclear warheads. The Cold War became frostier.



A Marxist revolution in NICARAGUA brought greater fears of communism spreading to the Western Hemisphere. Finally, in 1979 the Soviet Union invaded AFGHANISTAN with combat troops from the Red Army. Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev promised that Afghani leaders had requested military assistance, but American diplomats were dubious.



Fearing Soviet expansion into the Middle East, the Carter Administration strongly condemned the action and levied a wheat boycott on the Soviet Union. The 1980 OLYMPIC GAMES held in Moscow were boycotted by the United States.

America's claim to dominant status in the world had been seriously challenged, by the end of the 1970s.

So, Americans started looking inward, inside themselves, in the hope of feeling better.
