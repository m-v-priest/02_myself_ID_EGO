== 杰克逊式民主 -- 人民高于精英

=== 投票权的扩大

Leaders in the earlier system remained deeply suspicious that parties could corrupt and destroy the young republic.

[.my2]
早期体制的领导人仍然深感怀疑，认为政党可能会腐败并摧毁这个年轻的共和国。

Immediately after the Revolution /most states retained 保留；保存 some PROPERTY 所有物，财产 REQUIREMENTS that prevented poor people from voting. +
Following republican logic, citizens were believed to need an economic stake （在公司、计划等中的）重大利益，重大利害关系 in society in order to be trusted to vote wisely. +
If a voter lacked economic independence, then it seemed that those (指富人) who controlled his (指穷人) livelihood 生计，营生 could easily manipulate his vote.

[.my2]
革命结束后，大多数州立即保留了一些阻止穷人投票的财产要求。*按照共和逻辑，人们认为, 公民需要在社会中拥有经济利益，才能被信任他们能够进行明智的投票。如果一个选民缺乏经济独立，那么那些控制他生计的人, 似乎就可以轻易操纵他的选票(即购买他们的选票)。*

Ironically, just as _industrial wage labor_ began to create _dependent 依赖的，依靠的 laborers_ on a large new scale, _the older republican commitment_ to _propertied (a.)有财产的 voters_ fell out of favor. +
As _property requirements_ for voting were abolished, economic status disappeared as a foundation for citizenship 公民资格，公民身份. +
By 1840 more than 90 percent of _adult (a.) white men_ possessed the right to vote.

[.my2]
具有讽刺意味的是，正当工业工资劳动开始大规模地创造出依赖劳动者时，共和党对有产选民的旧承诺却失宠了。**随着投票的财产要求被废除，经济地位作为公民身份的基础消失了。**到 1840 年，超过 90% 的成年白人拥有投票权。

Not only that, voters could now cast 投票 their opinion for more offices. +
Previously 以前地，先前地, governors and presidential electors had usually been selected by state legislatures as part of a republican strategy that limited the threat  威胁 of direct democratic control 直接民主控制 over the highest political offices. +

The growing democratic temper of the first decades of the 19th century `谓` changed this /and increasingly all offices were chosen by direct vote. +
The United States was the world leader in allowing (v.) popular participation in elections. +
This triumph of American politics built upon, but also expanded, the egalitarian (a.)主张人人平等的 ideals of the American Revolution.

[.my2]
不仅如此，选民现在还可以为更多的职位表达意见。**此前，"州长"和"总统选举人", 通常由州"立法机构"选出，**作为共和党战略的一部分，限制直接民主控制最高政治职位的威胁。 **19 世纪头几十年日益增长的民主气氛改变了这一点，所有职位都越来越多地通过直接投票选出。**美国在允许民众参与选举方面处于世界领先地位。美国政治的这一胜利建立在美国革命的平等主义理想之上，但也扩展了这一理想。

This democratic 民主的 triumph, however, also had sharp 清楚明确的；清晰的；鲜明的 limitations 局限；限度;起限制作用的规则（或事实、条件） that today seem quite shocking. +
At the same time that state legislatures opened SUFFRAGE 选举权；投票权 (that is, the right to vote) to all white men, they simultaneously 同时地 closed the door firmly on white women and free African Americans. +
This movement was especially disappointing since it represented a retreat from a broader sense of political rights that had been included in some early state constitutions.

[.my2]
然而，这一民主胜利也有严重的局限性，今天看来相当令人震惊。在州立法机构向所有白人男性开放选举权（即投票权）的同时，他们同时牢牢地向白人女性和自由的非裔美国人关上了大门。这场运动尤其令人失望，因为它代表了一些早期州宪法所包含的更广泛的政治权利意识的倒退。

For example, New Jersey revised (v.)改变，修正；修改 its state constitution to abolish property requirements in 1807, but at the same time prevented all women from voting (even wealthy ones who had been allowed to vote there since 1776) as well as all free blacks.

[.my2]
例如，新泽西州于 1807 年修改了州宪法，废除了财产要求，但同时禁止所有妇女（甚至是自 1776 年以来被允许投票的富有妇女）以及所有自由黑人投票。

=== 杰克逊式民主 -- 人民高于精英

Van Buren, perhaps even more than Jackson, helped to create the new Democratic party that centered upon 集中于，以……为中心 three chief qualities 品质；特性 closely linked to Jacksonian Democracy. +
First, it declared itself to be the party of ordinary farmers and workers. +
Second, it opposed the special privileges of economic elites. +
Third, *to offer* affordable western land *to* ordinary white Americans, Indians needed to be forced further westward. +

The WHIG PARTY soon arose to challenge (v.) the Democrats 方式状 with a different policy platform and vision for the nation. +
Whigs' `谓` favored (v.) _active (a.)积极主动的 government support_ for economic improvement as the best route to sustained (v.) prosperity 兴旺；繁荣. +
Thus, the Whig-Democrat political contest `系` was in large part a disagreement about the early Industrial Revolution. +

Whigs `谓` defended (v.) economic development's broad benefits, while 而 Democrats stressed the new forms of dependence that it created. +
The fiercely 凶猛地，猛烈地 partisan campaigns waged (v.)开始，发动，进行，继续（战争、战斗等） between these parties lasted into the 1850s and are known as the SECOND PARTY SYSTEM, an assuredly 确实地；确信地 modern framework of political competition that reached ordinary voters as never before 史无前例的 with both sides organizing (v.) tirelessly 不知疲倦地；不屈不挠地 to carry their message directly to the American people.

[.my2]
范布伦，甚至可能比杰克逊，更加大力帮助创建了新的**"民主党"，它以三个主要品质为中心，**与杰克逊式民主密切相关。**首先，它宣称自己是普通农民和工人的政党。其次，它反对经济精英的特权。第三，为了向普通美国白人提供负担得起的西部土地，印第安人需要被迫进一步向西迁移。** +
**"辉格党"很快崛起，以不同的政策纲领和国家愿景挑战"民主党"。辉格党支持"政府积极支持经济改善的行动"，**认为这是实现持续繁荣的最佳途径。因此，"辉格党"和"民主党"的政治竞争, 在很大程度上是对"早期工业革命"的分歧。"辉格党"为"经济发展能带来广泛利益"进行辩护，而"民主党"则强调"经济发展带来的新形式的依赖"。 +
**两党之间激烈的党派斗争, 一直持续到19世纪50年代，被称为"第二党体系"，这是一种毫无疑问的"现代政治竞争框架"，前所未有地影响到普通选民，双方都不知疲倦地组织起来，直接向美国人民传达自己的信息。**

A new era of American politics began with Jackson's election in 1828, but it also completed a grand social experiment begun by the American Revolution. +
Although 虽然，尽管 the Founding Fathers would have been astounded 使惊愕 by the new shape of the nation during Jackson's presidency, just as Jackson himself had served in the American Revolution, its values helped form (v.) his sense of the world. +

The ideals of the Revolution had, of course, been altered by the new conditions of the early nineteenth century and would continue to be reworked over time 随着时间的流逝. +
Economic, religious, and geographic changes had all reshaped the nation in fundamental ways /and pointed (v.) toward still （加强比较级）还要，更 greater opportunities 机会；机遇 and pitfalls 陷阱，隐患 in the future. +

**1828年杰克逊的当选, 开启了美国政治的新纪元，同时也完成了美国革命开始的一项宏大的社会实验。**尽管开国元勋们, 会对杰克逊担任总统期间国家的新形态感到震惊，就像杰克逊本人在美国革命中服役一样，但它的价值观, 帮助形成了他的世界观。当然，**革命的理想, 已经被十九世纪初的新形势所改变，并且随着时间的推移将继续被修改。经济、宗教和地理的变化, 都从根本上重塑了这个国家，并为未来带来了更大的机遇和陷阱。**然而，杰克逊式民主, 代表了美国社会最好和最坏品质的挑衅性融合。一方面，这是一场真正的民主运动，包含有原则的平等主义主旨，但这种强有力的社会批评, 总是为了白人的利益。这种平等主义、男性特权, 和种族偏见的悲剧性混合体, 仍然是美国生活的核心品质，探索它们过去的关系, 可能有助于提出"克服它们在未来难以摆脱的局限性"的方法。

杰克逊时代无异于另一场美国革命。到了 1850 年，“普通人”要求在政治上占有一席之地，总统办公室充满活力，边疆对美国舞台产生了越来越强大的影响。安德鲁·杰克逊被许多人憎恨，但也受到更多人的喜爱，他体现了这种新的美国性格。

[.my2]
美国开国后, 前六位总统都是同一模子：富有、受过教育、来自东方。杰克逊是一个白手起家的人，他宣称教育对于政治领导来说是不必要的要求。事实上，杰克逊开创了一个政客们拼命试图展示他们有多么贫穷的时代。

[.my2]
在许多人看来，杰克逊 1828 年的就职典礼, 似乎是未受过教育的暴徒实施“暴民统治”的体现。杰克逊骑马前往白宫，后面跟着一大群受邀的祝福者。沾满泥巴的平头钉靴子踩在新地毯上，玻璃器皿和陶器被砸碎，一片混乱。过了一段时间，杰克逊下令将潘趣酒碗移到白宫草坪上，人群也跟着移动。自然，杰克逊的批评者很快指出, 这次聚会是“黑帮之王统治”的开始。

.spoils system
[ sing.]the arrangement in US politics which allows the President to give government jobs to supporters after winning an election（美国当选总统把官职分给支持者的）政党分肥制，赐职制

In politics and government, a _spoils system_ (also known as a _patronage 资助；赞助;（掌权者给予提挈以换取支持的）互惠互利 system_) is a practice in which a political party, after winning an election, *gives* government jobs *to* its supporters, friends (cronyism 任人唯亲；任用亲信), and relatives (nepotism 裙带关系；任人唯亲) as a reward for working toward 朝着……努力,迈进 victory, and as an incentive 激励，刺激 to keep working for the party — *as opposed to* 与……相对比,（表示对比）而，相对于 a _merit 值得赞扬（或奖励、钦佩）的特点；功绩；长处 system_, where offices are awarded or promoted 提升；晋升 on the basis of some measure 判断；衡量 of merit 优秀品质，价值；优点，长处, independent of 不依赖……的；不受……支配的 political activity.

在政治和政府中，分赃制（又称恩赐制）是指政党在选举获胜后，将政府职位给予其支持者、朋友（任人唯亲）和亲戚（裙带关系）作为奖励的做法。为争取胜利而努力，并作为继续为党工作的激励——这与功绩制度相反，在功绩制度中，职位的授予或晋升是根据某种功绩衡量的，与政治活动无关。

The term was used particularly in politics of the United States, where the federal government operated (v.) on a spoils system until the Pendleton Act was passed in 1883 due to a civil service 公务员 reform movement. Thereafter 其后，此后 the spoils system was largely replaced by nonpartisan 无党派的 merit at the federal level of the United States.

该术语特别用在美国政治中，美国联邦政府一直实行分赃制，直到 1883 年因公务员制度改革运动而通过《彭德尔顿法案》。此后，在美国联邦层面，战利品制度在很大程度上被无党派功绩所取代。

Jackson **believed in** rotation 轮换；交替；换班 in office. +
America was best served with clearing out 把…清空；清理；丢掉 the old officeholders /and replacing them with appointees 被任命者；被委任者 of the winning candidates. +
This "spoils system" would eventually lead to considerable CORRUPTION. +
To Jackson, rotating the officeholders was simply （强调简单）仅仅，只，不过 more democratic.

[.my2]
与此同时，杰克逊在授予政府职位时, 拥护“战利品制度”。在他看来，华盛顿街头行走的职业政客太多了。这些人已经与民众失去了联系。杰克逊相信, 政府办公室里的官员应执行"轮换制"。对美国最有利的做法就是清除旧的官员，用对"获胜的候选人"的任命, 来代替他们。这种“分赃制度”最终会导致严重的腐败。对杰克逊来说，轮换制更加民主。

While he made his share of enemies, Jackson *transformed* the Office of the President *into* one of dynamic 充满活力的，精力充沛的 leadership 领导班子；领导层 and initiative 主动性；积极性；自发性. +
His _direct appeal_  呼吁，恳求 to the people for support `系`  was new /and has served as a model for strong Presidents to this day.

[.my2]
杰克逊虽然树敌众多，但他把总统办公室, 也变成了一个充满"活力"和"工作主动性"的办公室。他对"支持人民"的直接呼吁, 是新颖的，至今仍是"强有力总统"的效仿榜样。

[.my2]
到 1820 年代末，北方工业化程度不断提高，而南方仍以农业为主。

In 1828, Congress passed a high protective tariff 关税 that infuriated (v.)激怒 the southern states because they felt it only benefited the industrialized north. +
For example, a high TARIFF on imports increased the cost of British TEXTILES 纺织品. +
This tariff benefited American producers of cloth — mostly in the north. +
But it shrunk (v.)（使）缩水，收缩，缩小 English demand for southern raw cotton /and increased the final cost of finished goods to American buyers. +

The southerners *looked to* 指望 Vice President John C. Calhoun from South Carolina *for* leadership against what they labeled the "TARIFF OF ABOMINATIONS 令人憎恨的事物；可恶的东西."

1828年，国会通过了一项高额"保护性关税"，这激怒了南方各州，因为他们认为, 这只会让"工业化的北方"受益。例如，"高进口关税"增加了从英国进口的纺织品的成本。这项关税使美国的"布料生产商"受益——主要是在北方(即, 对美国人来说, 英国进口货更贵了, 美国本国货相对更便宜了)。但这减少了英国对"美国南方的原棉"的需求，并增加了美国买家的"成品最终成本"(应为美国对英国的进口产品, 增加了关税, 抬高了在美国的售价)。南方人指望来自"南卡罗来纳州"的副总统"约翰·C·卡尔霍恩"（John C. Calhoun）发挥领导作用，反对他们所谓的“令人憎恶的关税”。


The Ordinance 条例；法令 of Nullification issued by South Carolina in 1832 `谓` foreshadowed (v.)预示，预兆 the state's announcement of secession （地区或集团从所属的国家或上级集团的）退出，脱离 nearly 30 years later.

**南卡罗来纳州于 1832 年颁布的《废除法令》, 预示着该州在美国开国近 30 年后, 宣布脱离联邦。**

Calhoun had supported the Tariff of 1816, but he realized that if he were to have a political future in South Carolina, he would need to rethink his position. +
Some felt that this issue was reason enough for dissolution 解体；瓦解；分裂 of the Union. +

Calhoun argued for a less drastic 极端的，激烈的 solution — the doctrine 教义；主义；学说；信条;（政府政策的）正式声明 of "NULLIFICATION." According to Calhoun, the federal government only existed *at the will of* 按…的意愿 the states. +
Therefore 因此，所以, if a state found a federal law unconstitutional 违反宪法的 and detrimental (a.)有害的，不利的 to its sovereign 有主权的；完全独立的 interests, it would have the right to "nullify" (v.)使无效，作废；取消 that law within its borders. +
Calhoun advanced 促进；推动 the position that a state could declare a national law void (a.)无效的.

[.my2]
卡尔霍恩曾支持 1816 年的关税，但他意识到，如果他想在"南卡罗来纳州"拥有政治前途，他需要重新考虑自己的立场。**一些人认为, 这个问题足以成为"脱离联盟"的理由。卡尔霍恩主张采取一种不那么激烈的解决方案——“无效化”说。卡尔霍恩认为，"联邦政府"仅根据"各州"的意愿而存在。因此，如果一个州发现一项"联邦法律"违宪, 并损害其(州的)主权利益，它就有权在其境内“废除”该法律。卡尔霍恩提出了一个立场，即"州可以宣布国家法律无效"。**


In 1832, Henry Clay pushed through Congress a new tariff bill, with lower rates than the Tariff of Abominations 令人憎恶或讨厌的人或事物, but still too high for the southerners. +

A majority of states-rights proponents 倡导者；支持者；拥护者 had won the South Carolina State House in the recent 1832 election and their reaction was swift. +

Jackson rightly regarded this STATES-RIGHTS challenge as so serious that he asked Congress to enact legislation permitting him to use federal troops to enforce federal laws in the face of nullification. +
Fortunately, an armed confrontation was avoided when Congress, led by the efforts of Henry Clay, revised the tariff with a compromise bill. +
This permitted the South Carolinians to back down without "losing face."

[.my2]
杰克逊正确地认为, 这一对"国家权力"的挑战非常严重，以至于他要求"国会"颁布立法，允许他在面临"州在拒绝联邦法律"的情况下, 使用"联邦军队"来执行"联邦法律"。幸运的是，在亨利·克莱的努力下，国会通过妥协法案, 修改了关税，避免了武装对抗。这使得南卡罗来纳人能够在“不丢面子”的情况下做出让步。

=== 新思想的爆发 An Explosion of New Thought

What did it mean to think like an American? Once the colonists had thrown off the burdens and controls of England, the possibilities for political, social and artistic creativity and experimentation seemed limitless. +
People felt optimistic and determined that a new order would be brought to bear, not just on government but on all institutions of social interaction. +
So, from the beginning of the 1800s until the first gunshot of the Civil War, the American experiment unfolded like an epic. +
Opportunity, heightened by political freedom and a surge of nationalism, caused most citizens to believe that the experiment might actually work. +
Thus, a uniquely American tradition in literature, art, thought, and social reform emerged.

像美国人一样思考意味着什么？**一旦殖民者摆脱了英国的负担和控制，政治、社会和艺术创造力, 和实验的可能性, 似乎是无限的。**人们感到乐观, 并决心建立新的秩序，不仅对政府, 而且对所有社会中的互动机构。**因此，从 1800 年代初, 到南北战争第一声枪响，美国的实验, 像史诗一样展开。**政治自由和民族主义高涨带来的机遇, 让大多数公民相信, 这项实验可能确实有效。由此，美国在文学、艺术、思想和社会改革方面, 形成了独特的传统。



Religion was renewed through a Second Great Awakening. +
Evangelists on a "divine mission" believed that churches were the proper agents of change, not violence or political movements. +
Ardent believers in the perfectibility of society tried communal living with distinctly utopian goals, convinced that ultimately their small fellowships would grow into larger, more influential gatherings for the common good of all. +
Women began to explore the possibility of individual rights and equality with men. +
Their agenda was quite vast and included not only the right to vote but also such diverse problems as prohibition and world peace. +
Reformers, sure that the dire human conditions in prisons, workhouses and asylums were the result of bad institutions and not bad people, made gallant efforts to alleviate pain and suffering. +
Hopes were high that cures for social disorders in America caused by rapid expansion, population growth, and industrialization would work.

女性开始探索个人权利, 和与男性平等的可能性。他们的议程相当广泛，不仅包括"投票权"，还包括"禁酒令", 和"世界和平"等各种各样的问题。 +
改革者确信，监狱、济贫院和收容所中的恶劣的人性条件, 是由糟糕的机构, 而不是坏人造成的，因此他们做出了巨大的努力来减轻痛苦和苦难。 +
*人们对治愈"美国因快速扩张、人口增长, 和工业化而造成的社会混乱"的治疗方法能够发挥作用, 寄予厚望。*

But, like any other, it inevitably developed problems for which neither optimism nor expansion, religion nor reform could provide answers. +
The tragic flaw in the American experiment would slowly reveal itself in the widening breach between the North and the South over the issue of slavery. +
As the tone of the Abolitionist cause became more and more shrill, it began to drown out moderation, compromise and good feelings. +
Americans had previously been willing to argue about everything from women's rights to the virtues of homemade bread, yet rarely did they lose sight of another American's right to disagree. +
But the unprecedented divisiveness of the institution of slavery and the resultant catastrophe of the Civil War brought down the curtain, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, on "the better angels of our Nature."

=== 昭昭天命 Manifest Destiny

Expansion westward seemed perfectly natural to many Americans in the mid-nineteenth century. +
Like the Massachusetts Puritans who hoped to build a "city upon a hill, "courageous pioneers believed that America had a divine obligation to stretch the boundaries of their noble republic to the Pacific Ocean. +
Independence had been won in the Revolution and reaffirmed in the War of 1812. +
The spirit of nationalism that swept the nation in the next two decades demanded more territory. +
The "every man is equal" mentality of the Jacksonian Era fueled this optimism. +
Now, with territory up to the Mississippi River claimed and settled and the Louisiana Purchase explored, Americans headed west in droves. +
Newspaper editor JOHN O'SULLIVAN coined the term "MANIFEST DESTINY" in 1845 to describe the essence of this mindset.

[.my2]
对于十九世纪中叶的许多美国人来说，向西扩张似乎是很自然的事情。*就像马萨诸塞州的清教徒希望建立一座“山巅之城”一样，勇敢的先驱者们相信, 美国有神圣的义务, 将他们高贵的共和国的边界, 延伸到太平洋。*"美国的独立"已经在革命中赢得，并在 1812 年的战争中得到了巩固。在接下来的二十年里, 席卷全国的民族主义精神需要更多的领土。杰克逊时代“人人平等”的心态, 助长了这种乐观情绪。现在，随着密西西比河沿岸的领土被宣称和定居，以及对路易斯安那购买地的探索，美国人成群结队地向西进发。报纸编辑约翰·奥沙利文 (JOHN O'SULLIVAN) 于 1845 年创造了**“昭昭天命”(MANIFEST DESTINY) 一词来描述这种心态的本质。**



The religious fervor spawned by the Second Great Awakening created another incentive for the drive west. +
Indeed, many settlers believed that God himself blessed the growth of the American nation. +
The Native Americans were considered heathens. +
By Christianizing the tribes, American missionaries believed they could save souls and they became among the first to cross the Mississippi River.

[.my2]
**"第二次大觉醒"引发的宗教狂热, 为西进创造了另一个动力。事实上，许多定居者相信, 上帝亲自祝福美国民族的成长。**美洲原住民被认为是异教徒。通过使部落基督教化，*美国传教士相信他们可以拯救灵魂，并成为第一批横渡密西西比河的人之一。*

Economic motives were paramount for others. +
The fur trade had been dominated by European trading companies since colonial times. +
German immigrant John Jacob Astor was one of the first American entrepreneurs to challenge the Europeans. +
He became a millionaire in the process. +
The desire for more land brought aspiring homesteaders to the frontier. +
When gold was discovered in California in 1848, the number of migrants increased even more.

[.my2]
**对于其他人来说，经济动机至关重要。**自殖民时代以来，毛皮贸易一直由欧洲贸易公司主导。德国移民约翰·雅各布·阿斯特是最早挑战欧洲人的美国企业家之一。在这个过程中他成为了百万富翁。对更多土地的渴望, 将"有抱负的自耕农"带到了边境。 1848 年，*加利福尼亚州发现金矿后，移民人数进一步增加。*

At the heart of manifest destiny was the pervasive belief in American cultural and racial superiority. +
Native Americans had long been perceived as inferior, and efforts to "civilize" them had been widespread since the days of John Smith and MILES STANDISH. +
The Hispanics who ruled Texas and the lucrative ports of California were also seen as "backward."

[.my2]
**"昭昭天命"的核心是, 对美国文化和种族优越性的普遍信念。**长期以来，美洲原住民一直被视为低等人，自约翰·史密斯和迈尔斯·斯坦迪什时代以来，“教化”他们的努力就已广泛存在。统治"德克萨斯州"和利润丰厚的"加利福尼亚港口"的西班牙裔, 也被视为“落后”。



Expanding the boundaries of the United States was in many ways a cultural war as well. +
The desire of southerners to find more lands suitable for cotton cultivation would eventually spread slavery to these regions. +
North of the Mason-Dixon line, many citizens were deeply concerned about adding any more slave states. +
Manifest destiny touched on issues of religion, money, race, patriotism, and morality. +
These clashed in the 1840s as a truly great drama of regional conflict began to unfold.

[.my2]
扩大美国疆域, 在很多方面也是一场思想文化上的战争。**南方人渴望找到更多适合棉花种植的土地，最终将"奴隶制"传播到这些地区。在梅森-迪克森线以北，许多公民对增加更多"奴隶州"深感担忧。**天命论涉及宗教、金钱、种族、爱国主义和道德等问题。这些冲突在 1840 年代发生，一场真正伟大的地区冲突戏剧开始上演。



At the time Spain granted independence to Mexico in 1821, the land now comprising the state of Texas was very sparsely populated. +

=== 投票权的扩大

Leaders in the earlier system remained deeply suspicious that parties could corrupt and destroy the young republic.

Immediately after the Revolution most states retained some PROPERTY REQUIREMENTS that prevented poor people from voting. Following republican logic, citizens were believed to need an economic stake in society in order to be trusted to vote wisely. If a voter lacked economic independence, then it seemed that those who controlled his livelihood could easily manipulate his vote.

Ironically, just as industrial wage labor began to create dependent laborers on a large new scale, the older republican commitment to propertied voters fell out of favor. As property requirements for voting were abolished, economic status disappeared as a foundation for citizenship. By 1840 more than 90 percent of adult white men possessed the right to vote.

Not only that, voters could now cast their opinion for more offices. Previously, governors and presidential electors had usually been selected by state legislatures as part of a republican strategy that limited the threat of direct democratic control over the highest political offices. The growing democratic temper of the first decades of the 19th century changed this and increasingly all offices were chosen by direct vote. The United States was the world leader in allowing popular participation in elections. This triumph of American politics built upon, but also expanded, the egalitarian ideals of the American Revolution.

This democratic triumph, however, also had sharp limitations that today seem quite shocking. At the same time that state legislatures opened SUFFRAGE (that is, the right to vote) to all white men, they simultaneously closed the door firmly on white women and free African Americans. This movement was especially disappointing since it represented a retreat from a broader sense of political rights that had been included in some early state constitutions.


For example, New Jersey revised its state constitution to abolish property requirements in 1807, but at the same time prevented all women from voting (even wealthy ones who had been allowed to vote there since 1776) as well as all free blacks.

=== 杰克逊式民主 -- 人民高于精英

Van Buren, perhaps even more than Jackson, helped to create the new Democratic party that centered upon three chief qualities closely linked to Jacksonian Democracy. First, it declared itself to be the party of ordinary farmers and workers. Second, it opposed the special privileges of economic elites. Third, to offer affordable western land to ordinary white Americans, Indians needed to be forced further westward. The WHIG PARTY soon arose to challenge the Democrats with a different policy platform and vision for the nation. Whigs' favored active government support for economic improvement as the best route to sustained prosperity. Thus, the Whig-Democrat political contest was in large part a disagreement about the early Industrial Revolution. Whigs defended economic development's broad benefits, while Democrats stressed the new forms of dependence that it created. The fiercely partisan campaigns waged between these parties lasted into the 1850s and are known as the SECOND PARTY SYSTEM, an assuredly modern framework of political competition that reached ordinary voters as never before with both sides organizing tirelessly to carry their message directly to the American people.


A new era of American politics began with Jackson's election in 1828, but it also completed a grand social experiment begun by the American Revolution. Although the Founding Fathers would have been astounded by the new shape of the nation during Jackson's presidency, just as Jackson himself had served in the American Revolution, its values helped form his sense of the world. The ideals of the Revolution had, of course, been altered by the new conditions of the early nineteenth century and would continue to be reworked over time. Economic, religious, and geographic changes had all reshaped the nation in fundamental ways and pointed toward still greater opportunities and pitfalls in the future. Nevertheless, JACKSONIAN DEMOCRACY represented a provocative blending of the best and worst qualities of American society. On the one hand it was an authentic democratic movement that contained a principled egalitarian thrust, but this powerful social critique was always cast for the benefit of white men. This tragic mix of egalitarianism, masculine privilege, and racial prejudice remains a central quality of American life and to explore their relationship in the past may help suggest ways of overcoming their haunting limitations in the future.


On July 4, 1826, less than two years before "KING ANDREW" ascended to the "throne," the Yankee JOHN ADAMS and the aristocratic Virginian THOMAS JEFFERSON both passed away. America's Revolutionary generation was gone. With them went the last vestiges of the FEDERALIST and DEMOCRATIC-REPUBLICAN parties. This helped to bring about a new balance of political power, and with it two new political parties. The 1828 election was portrayed by Jackson's Democrats as proof of the "common people's right" to pick a President. No longer were Virginia Presidents and northern money-men calling the shots. Class systems were breaking down. To that end, some states had recently abolished property requirements for voting. These poorer folk supported General Jackson.

Jackson's strong personality and controversial ways incited the development of an opposition party, the WHIGS. Their name echoes British history. In Great Britain, the Whigs were the party opposed to a strong monarch. By calling themselves Whigs, Jackson's enemies labeled him a king. And they held firm in their opposition to "King Andrew" and his hated policies.

Sectional rivalries bubbled to the surface as the ERA OF GOOD FEELINGS slipped into history. The South began feeling more and more resentful of the influential manufacturers of the North. The South's resentment came to an ugly head in the nullification battle of the early 1830s in which South Carolina considered leaving the Union because it disagreed with a federal law. The Second Bank of the United States was seen by westerners and southerners as a tool to make northerners and easterners rich at the expense of the rest of the country. Through force of personality, Jackson got his way in the nullification battle and triumphed again when he vetoed the charter of the national bank. These regional rifts would only get worse over time.


The Jacksonian Era was nothing short of another American Revolution. By 1850, the "common man" demanded his place in politics, the office of the president was invigorated, and the frontier exerted its ever more powerful impact on the American scene. Hated by many, but loved by many more, Andrew Jackson embodied this new American character.

Growth, expansion and social change rapidly followed the end of the WAR OF 1812. Many an enterprising American pushed westward. In the new western states, there was a greater level of equality among the masses than in the former English colonies. Land was readily available. Frontier life required hard work. There was little tolerance for aristocrats afraid to get their hands dirty.

The west led the path by having no property requirements for voting, which the eastern states soon adopted, as well.

The COMMON MAN always held a special place in America, but with Jackson, he rose to the top of the American political power system.

In the campaign of 1828, Jackson, known as "OLD HICKORY," triumphed over the aristocratic, reclusive and unpopular incumbent PRESIDENT JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.

The first six Presidents were from the same mold: wealthy, educated, and from the east. Jackson was a self-made man who declared education an unnecessary requirement for political leadership. Indeed, Jackson launched the era when politicians would desperately try to show how poor they had been.

Jackson's inauguration in 1828 seemed to many the embodiment of "MOB RULE" by uneducated ruffians. Jackson rode to the White House followed by a swarm of well-wishers who were invited in. Muddy hob-nailed boots trod over new carpets, glassware and crockery were smashed, and chaos generally reigned. After a time, Jackson ordered the punch bowls moved outside to the White House lawn, and the crowd followed. Naturally, Jackson's critics were quick to point to the party as the beginning of the "reign of King Mob."


As a military hero, a frontiersman, and a POPULIST, Jackson enchanted the common people and alarmed the political, social and economic elite. A Man of the People would now govern the nation — America did not disintegrate into anarchy.


Jackson was committed to remaining a MAN OF THE PEOPLE, representing and protecting the Common Man. He possessed a commanding presence, a strong will, and a personality that reflected his strength and decisiveness. Jackson had a lot going for him in the view of the electorate. In the War of 1812, he defeated the British at NEW ORLEANS IN 1815. He was renowned as an Indian fighter. Jackson's military service had produced a large and influential group of supporters and friends who urged him to seek the Presidency.

Major General Andrew Jackson made a name for himself at the Battle of New Orleans. He was the only U.S. President to be a veteran of both the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812.

The Founders of the nation feared a tyrannical President — they believed that only a strong Congress could best represent the people. Jackson felt that the Congress was not representing the people — that they were acting like an aristocracy. Jackson took the view that only the President could be trusted to stand for the will of the people against the aristocratic Congress. Jackson's weapon was the veto. "ANDY VETO" used this power more often than all six previous Presidents combined.

At the same time, Jackson espoused the "SPOILS SYSTEM" in awarding government offices. In his view, far too many career politicians walked the streets of Washington. These people had lost touch with the public. Jackson believed in rotation in office. America was best served with clearing out the old officeholders and replacing them with appointees of the winning candidates. This "spoils system" would eventually lead to considerable CORRUPTION. To Jackson, rotating the officeholders was simply more democratic.

While he made his share of enemies, Jackson transformed the Office of the President into one of dynamic leadership and initiative. His direct appeal to the people for support was new and has served as a model for strong Presidents to this day.

=== The South Carolina Nullification Controversy

By the late 1820's, the north was becoming increasingly industrialized, and the south was remaining predominately agricultural.

In 1828, Congress passed a high protective tariff that infuriated the southern states because they felt it only benefited the industrialized north. For example, a high TARIFF on imports increased the cost of British TEXTILES. This tariff benefited American producers of cloth — mostly in the north. But it shrunk English demand for southern raw cotton and increased the final cost of finished goods to American buyers. The southerners looked to Vice President John C. Calhoun from South Carolina for leadership against what they labeled the "TARIFF OF ABOMINATIONS."


The Ordinance of Nullification issued by South Carolina in 1832 foreshadowed the state's announcement of secession nearly 30 years later.

Calhoun had supported the Tariff of 1816, but he realized that if he were to have a political future in South Carolina, he would need to rethink his position. Some felt that this issue was reason enough for dissolution of the Union. Calhoun argued for a less drastic solution — the doctrine of "NULLIFICATION." According to Calhoun, the federal government only existed at the will of the states. Therefore, if a state found a federal law unconstitutional and detrimental to its sovereign interests, it would have the right to "nullify" that law within its borders. Calhoun advanced the position that a state could declare a national law void.


In 1832, Henry Clay pushed through Congress a new tariff bill, with lower rates than the Tariff of Abominations, but still too high for the southerners. A majority of states-rights proponents had won the South Carolina State House in the recent 1832 election and their reaction was swift. The SOUTH CAROLINA ORDINANCE OF NULLIFICATION was enacted into law on November 24, 1832. As far as South Carolina was concerned, there was no tariff. A line had been drawn. Would President Jackson dare to cross it?

Jackson rightly regarded this STATES-RIGHTS challenge as so serious that he asked Congress to enact legislation permitting him to use federal troops to enforce federal laws in the face of nullification. Fortunately, an armed confrontation was avoided when Congress, led by the efforts of Henry Clay, revised the tariff with a compromise bill. This permitted the South Carolinians to back down without "losing face."

In retrospect, Jackson's strong, decisive support for the Union was one of the great moments of his Presidency. If nullification had been successful, could secession have been far behind?

===  The Rise of American Industry

During the first 30 years of the 1800s, AMERICAN INDUSTRY was truly born.

In 1790, SAMUEL SLATER built the first factory in America, based on the secrets of textile manufacturing he brought from England.

Ever since the days of Jamestown and Plymouth, America was moving West. TRAIL BLAZERS had first hewn their way on foot and by horseback. HOMESTEADERS followed by WAGON and by either keelboat or bargeboat, bringing their possessions with them. Yet, real growth in the movement of people and goods west started with the canal.

For over a hundred years, people had dreamed of building a canal across New York that would connect the Great Lakes to the Hudson River to New York City and the Atlantic Ocean. After unsuccessfully seeking federal government assistance, DEWITT CLINTON successfully petitioned the New York State legislature to build the canal and bring that dream to reality.


Construction began in 1817 and was completed in 1825. The canal spanned 350 miles between the Great Lakes and the Hudson River and was an immediate success. Between its completion and its closure in 1882, it returned over $121 million in revenues on an original cost of $7 million. Its success led to the great CANAL AGE. By bringing the Great Lakes within reach of a metropolitan market, the ERIE CANAL opened up the unsettled northern regions of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. It also fostered the development of many small industrial companies, whose products were used in the construction and operation of the canal.

New York City became the principal gateway to the West and financial center for the nation. The Erie Canal was also in part responsible for the creation of strong bonds between the new western territories and the northern states. Soon the flat lands of the west would be converted into large-scale grain farming. The Canal enabled the farmers to send their goods to New England. Subsistence farmers in the north were now less necessary. Many farmers left for jobs in the factories. The Erie Canal transformed America.



Pennsylvanians were shocked to find that the cheapest route to Pittsburgh was by way of New York City, up the Hudson River, across New York by the Erie Canal to the Great Lakes — with a short overland trip to Pittsburgh. When it became evident that little help for state improvements could be expected from the federal government, other states followed New York in constructing canals. Ohio built a canal in 1834 to link the Great Lakes with the Mississippi Valley. As a result of Ohio's investment, Cleveland rose from a frontier village to a Great Lakes port by 1850. Cincinnati could now send food products down the Ohio and Mississippi by flatboat and steamboat and ship flour by canal boat to New York.

The state of Pennsylvania then put through a great portage canal system to Pittsburgh. It used a series of inclined planes and stationary steam engines to transport canal boats up and over the Alleghenies on rails. At its peak, Pennsylvania had almost a thousand miles of canals in operation. By the 1830s, the country had a complete water route from New York City to New Orleans. By 1840, over 3,000 miles of canals had been built. Yet, within twenty years a new mode of transportation, the railroad, would render most of them unprofitable.

The development of RAILROADS was one of the most important phenomena of the Industrial Revolution. With their formation, construction and operation, they brought profound social, economic and political change to a country only 50 years old.

Baltimore, the third largest city in the nation in 1827, had not invested in a canal. Yet, Baltimore was 200 miles closer to the frontier than New York and soon recognized that the development of a railway could make the city more competitive with New York and the Erie Canal in transporting people and goods to the West. The result was the BALTIMORE AND OHIO RAILROAD, the first railroad chartered in the United States.


Although the first railroads were successful, attempts to finance new ones originally failed as opposition was mounted by turnpike operators, canal companies, stagecoach companies and those who drove wagons. But the economic benefits of the railroad soon won over the skeptics.


Perhaps the greatest physical feat of 19th century America was the creation of the TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD. Two railroads, the CENTRAL PACIFIC starting in San Francisco and a new railroad, the Union Pacific, starting in Omaha, Nebraska, would build the rail-line. Huge forces of immigrants, mainly Irish for the UNION PACIFIC and Chinese for the Central Pacific, crossed mountains, dug tunnels and laid track. The two railroads met at PROMONTORY, UTAH, on May 10, 1869.


While New England was moving to mechanize manufacturing, others were working to mechanize agriculture. CYRUS MCCORMICK wanted to design equipment that would simplify farmers' work.


Perhaps no one had as great an impact on the development of the industrial north as ELI WHITNEY. Whitney raised eyebrows when he walked into the US Patent office, took apart ten guns, and reassembled them mixing the parts of each gun. Whitney lived in an age where an artisan would handcraft each part of every gun. No two products were quite the same. Whitney's milling machine allowed workers to cut metal objects in an identical fashion, making INTERCHANGEABLE PARTS. It was the start of the concept of mass production.


In the middle half of the nineteenth century, more than one-half of the population of IRELAND emigrated to the United States. So did an equal number of GERMANS. Most of them came because of civil unrest, severe unemployment or almost inconceivable hardships at home. This wave of immigration affected almost every city and almost every person in America. From 1820 to 1870, over seven and a half million immigrants came to the United States — more than the entire population of the country in 1810. Nearly all of them came from northern and western Europe — about a third from Ireland and almost a third from Germany. Burgeoning companies were able to absorb all that wanted to work.  Immigrants built canals and constructed railroads.  They became involved in almost every labor-intensive endeavor in the country.

In Ireland almost half of the population lived on farms that produced little income. Because of their poverty, most Irish people depended on potatoes for food. When this crop failed three years in succession, it led to a great FAMINE with horrendous consequences. Over 750,000 people starved to death. Over two million Irish eventually moved to the United States seeking relief from their desolated country. Impoverished, the Irish could not buy property. Instead, they congregated in the cities where they landed, almost all in the northeastern United States. Today, Ireland has just half the population it did in the early 1840s. There are now more Irish Americans than there are Irish nationals.

In the decade from 1845 to 1855, more than a million Germans fled to the United States to escape economic hardship. They also sought to escape the political unrest caused by riots, rebellion and eventually a revolution in 1848. The Germans had little choice — few other places besides the United States allowed German immigration. Unlike the Irish, many Germans had enough money to journey to the Midwest in search of farmland and work. The largest settlements of Germans were in New York City, Baltimore, Cincinnati, St. Louis and Milwaukee.

With the vast numbers of German and Irish coming to America, hostility to them erupted. Part of the reason for the opposition was religious. All of the Irish and many of the Germans were Roman Catholic. Part of the opposition was political. Most immigrants living in cities became Democrats because the party focused on the needs of commoners. Part of the opposition occurred because Americans in low-paying jobs were threatened and sometimes replaced by groups willing to work for almost nothing in order to survive.

Ethnic and ANTI-CATHOLIC RIOTING occurred in many northern cites.

===  An Explosion of New Thought

What did it mean to think like an American? Once the colonists had thrown off the burdens and controls of England, the possibilities for political, social and artistic creativity and experimentation seemed limitless. People felt optimistic and determined that a new order would be brought to bear, not just on government but on all institutions of social interaction. So, from the beginning of the 1800s until the first gunshot of the Civil War, the American experiment unfolded like an epic. Opportunity, heightened by political freedom and a surge of nationalism, caused most citizens to believe that the experiment might actually work. Thus, a uniquely American tradition in literature, art, thought, and social reform emerged.



Religion was renewed through a Second Great Awakening. Evangelists on a "divine mission" believed that churches were the proper agents of change, not violence or political movements. Ardent believers in the perfectibility of society tried communal living with distinctly utopian goals, convinced that ultimately their small fellowships would grow into larger, more influential gatherings for the common good of all. Women began to explore the possibility of individual rights and equality with men. Their agenda was quite vast and included not only the right to vote but also such diverse problems as prohibition and world peace. Reformers, sure that the dire human conditions in prisons, workhouses and asylums were the result of bad institutions and not bad people, made gallant efforts to alleviate pain and suffering. Hopes were high that cures for social disorders in America caused by rapid expansion, population growth, and industrialization would work.


The Transcendentalists and literary lights wanted to remind everyone who he or she was and might become. Their philosophy celebrated individualism, the goodness of humankind and the benevolence of the universe.

It was an exciting era to live in. But, like any other, it inevitably developed problems for which neither optimism nor expansion, religion nor reform could provide answers. The tragic flaw in the American experiment would slowly reveal itself in the widening breach between the North and the South over the issue of slavery. As the tone of the Abolitionist cause became more and more shrill, it began to drown out moderation, compromise and good feelings. Americans had previously been willing to argue about everything from women's rights to the virtues of homemade bread, yet rarely did they lose sight of another American's right to disagree. But the unprecedented divisiveness of the institution of slavery and the resultant catastrophe of the Civil War brought down the curtain, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, on "the better angels of our Nature."

===  Chivalry


By around 1825, the dominance of Virginia was fading and the emergence of King Cotton shifted the center of Southern influence to South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi.

A proper GENTLEMAN, it was believed, should be a lawyer, politician, planter, or military man, rather than be a businessman or other occupation. Because plantation owners had their money tied up in property and slaves, many of the generation could not afford to send their children to prestigious colleges, but were able to send them to the esteemed military schools. This created a generation of very able and talented military officers. Many were trained at WEST POINT and VIRGINIA MILITARY INSTITUTE. They held to old-fashioned ideals of what honorable warfare meant. When the Civil War arrived, most of the military leadership talent was southern.

=== 昭昭天命 Manifest Destiny

Expansion westward seemed perfectly natural to many Americans in the mid-nineteenth century. Like the Massachusetts Puritans who hoped to build a "city upon a hill, "courageous pioneers believed that America had a divine obligation to stretch the boundaries of their noble republic to the Pacific Ocean. Independence had been won in the Revolution and reaffirmed in the War of 1812. The spirit of nationalism that swept the nation in the next two decades demanded more territory. The "every man is equal" mentality of the Jacksonian Era fueled this optimism. Now, with territory up to the Mississippi River claimed and settled and the Louisiana Purchase explored, Americans headed west in droves. Newspaper editor JOHN O'SULLIVAN coined the term "MANIFEST DESTINY" in 1845 to describe the essence of this mindset.



The religious fervor spawned by the Second Great Awakening created another incentive for the drive west. Indeed, many settlers believed that God himself blessed the growth of the American nation. The Native Americans were considered heathens. By Christianizing the tribes, American missionaries believed they could save souls and they became among the first to cross the Mississippi River.

Economic motives were paramount for others. The fur trade had been dominated by European trading companies since colonial times. German immigrant John Jacob Astor was one of the first American entrepreneurs to challenge the Europeans. He became a millionaire in the process. The desire for more land brought aspiring homesteaders to the frontier. When gold was discovered in California in 1848, the number of migrants increased even more.

At the heart of manifest destiny was the pervasive belief in American cultural and racial superiority. Native Americans had long been perceived as inferior, and efforts to "civilize" them had been widespread since the days of John Smith and MILES STANDISH. The Hispanics who ruled Texas and the lucrative ports of California were also seen as "backward."



Expanding the boundaries of the United States was in many ways a cultural war as well. The desire of southerners to find more lands suitable for cotton cultivation would eventually spread slavery to these regions. North of the Mason-Dixon line, many citizens were deeply concerned about adding any more slave states. Manifest destiny touched on issues of religion, money, race, patriotism, and morality. These clashed in the 1840s as a truly great drama of regional conflict began to unfold.



At the time Spain granted independence to Mexico in 1821, the land now comprising the state of Texas was very sparsely populated. The Mexican government actually encouraged the settlement of the area by American pioneers.


In 1823, STEPHEN AUSTIN led 300 American families onto land granted to his father by the Mexican government. A prosperous province was greatly in the interest of Mexico, so no alarm was raised. Mexico was also interested in creating a buffer zone between the Mexican heartland and the COMANCHE TRIBE.

There were, however, strings attached.

The American settlers were expected to become Mexican. All immigrants from the United States were by law forced to become Catholic. When the Mexican government outlawed slavery in 1829, it expected the Texans to follow suit. None of the conditions were met, and a great cultural war was underway.


relations between the Texans and the Mexicans deteriorated. On March 2, 1836, representatives from Texas formally declared their independence.

Most TEXAN-AMERICANS wanted to be annexed by the United States. They feared that the Mexican government might soon try to recapture their land. Many had originally come from the American south and had great interest in becoming a southern state. President Andrew Jackson saw trouble. Many Whigs and Abolitionists in the North refused to admit another slave state to the Union. Rather than risk tearing the nation apart over this controversial issue, Jackson did not pursue annexation. The Lone Star flag flew proudly over the LONE STAR REPUBLIC for nine years.

Texas was an independent country.
