=== The Gilded Age 镀金时代

[.my1]
====
.Gilded Age 镀金时代
*处于美国历史中"南北战争"和"进步时代"之间，时间上大概是从1870年代到1900年。* 这个名字取自马克·吐温第一部长篇小说。
====

From the ashes of the American Civil War `谓` sprung (v.)跳；跃；蹦;突然出现（或来到） an economic powerhouse 强大的集团（或组织）;精力充沛的人；身强力壮的人.

[.my2]
增长是惊人的。从 1877 年重建结束, 到 1893 年灾难性的恐慌，美国经济规模几乎翻了一番。新技术和新的业务组织方式, 让一些人登上了顶峰。竞争是残酷的。那些无法以最便宜的价格提供最好的产品的企业, 要么被迫破产，要么被贪婪、成功的实业家收购。



The so-called captains 船长；机长 of industry became household 全家人的；家喻户晓的 names: _John D. Rockefeller_ of Standard Oil, _Andrew Carnegie_ of Carnegie Steel 钢，钢铁, and _J. Pierpont Morgan_, the powerful banker who controlled a great many industries. +
Their tactics 策略；手段；招数 were not always fair, but there were few laws regulating (v.) business conduct at that time.

[.my2]
所谓的工业领袖, 变得家喻户晓：标准石油公司的约翰·D·洛克菲勒、卡内基钢铁公司的安德鲁·卡内基, 和控制着许多工业的强大银行家J·皮尔庞特·摩根。他们的策略并不总是公平的，但当时很少有法律来规范商业行为。

約翰·D·洛克斐勒. 1839—1937

1870年创立"标准石油"，在全盛期垄断了全美90%的石油市场，成为历史上的第一位亿万富豪与全球首富。 +
标准石油最后被判决违反"反托拉斯法", 并在1911年被拆分为34家公司（事实上，反托拉斯法正是针对标准石油而制定的）。

另一方面，洛克菲勒在人生的后40年致力于慈善事业，主要是教育和医药领域，而在1897年结束对标准石油的直接管理。 +
他出资成立洛克菲勒研究所, 资助医学研究，主要贡献包括；成立 约翰霍普金斯公共卫生学院、哈佛大学公共卫生学院、丹尼森大学、北京协和医学院. +
今天的两所美国顶尖大学：芝加哥大学与洛克菲勒大学都是他创办的。 +
现今的纽约市也有许多洛克菲勒家族出资建立的地标，如联合国总部大楼、洛克菲勒中心等等。

洛克菲勒一生总共捐助了约5亿5千万美元（其总财产约14亿美元）于慈善事业。

他享寿九十七岁。他1937年过世时，其财富总值估计为14亿美元。(美国GDP920亿美元，1.5%)。



.Rockefeller Center
洛克菲勒中心:  由十九栋大楼组成，各大楼底层相通。1987年被美国政府认定为国家历史地标。

.Andrew Carnegie
image:/img/Andrew Carnegie.jpg[,30%]

安德鲁·卡内基. (1835—1919）

到了1880年代末，卡内基钢铁已成为全世界最大的生铁和焦碳制造者. 1901年，他以4.8亿美元的价格卖掉了卡内基钢铁公司，当时卡内基钢铁公司生产的钢铁已经占全美钢铁销售总量的25％。在事业高峰期时，卡内基是世界第二富豪，今天他更被视人类近代历史上第二富，仅次于与他同时代的洛克菲勒。

1919年去世前，卡内基一共捐出3亿5069万美元.

卡内基在商业人生上相信"社会达尔文主义".


.J. Pierpont Morgan
image:/img/J. Pierpont Morgan.jpg[,30%]

J·P·摩根 (1837—1913):   +
美国金融家和投资银行家，在整个镀金时代主导着华尔街的企业融资。 +
由于J·P·摩根的影响力遍布美国金融高层及国会议员，其对美国金融的支配程度，使他能够对国家的政策和支撑其经济的市场力量施加巨大的影响。 +

They organized _labor unions_ 工会 and were not averse (a.)不喜欢；不想做；反对做 to violence.

[.my2]
“莫莉·马奎尔”是一群 19 世纪的爱尔兰移民劳工，他们在美国工业中挣扎求生。他们组织了工会，并不反对暴力。

By 1914, `主` the small nation 后定 once seen as a playground for European empires `谓` had now surpassed  (v.)超过，凌驾 them all.
The United States had become the largest industrial nation in the world.

[.my2]
尽管如此，美国经济却不断增长。到 1914 年，这个曾经被视为欧洲帝国游乐场的小国, 现在已经超越了所有欧洲帝国。美国已成为世界上最大的工业国。

However, the prosperity  繁荣，成功 of America did not reach everyone. +
Amid the fabulous (a.)极好的；绝妙的;很大的；巨大的 wealth of the new economic elite was tremendous poverty. +
How did some manage to be so successful /while others struggled to put food on the table? Americans *wrestled (v.)摔跤;奋力对付；努力处理；全力解决 with* this great question /as _new attitudes toward wealth_ began to emerge.

[.my2]
**然而，当时美国的繁荣并没有惠及所有人。在新经济精英的巨额财富背后, 却是巨大的贫困。**为什么有些人能够如此成功，而另一些人却只能勉强维持生计？随着新的财富态度开始出现，美国人开始思考这个重大问题。

CORRUPTION spread like a plague through the city, state, and national governments.
Greedy legislators and "forgettable" 易被忘记的，不值得记住的 Presidents `谓` dominated the political scene.

[.my2]
政府在这一趋势中扮演了什么角色?基本上，它是支持商业的(即支持企业主的)。国会、总统和法院都对这种新的增长持赞成态度。但在政治层面上普遍缺乏领导力。腐败像瘟疫一样在城市、州和国家政府中蔓延。贪婪的立法者和“容易被遗忘的”总统主导了政治舞台。

[.my2]
**镀金时代, 将因成千上万的美国思想家、发明家、企业家、作家, 和社会正义推动者的成就, 而被铭记。很少有政治家能够对改变美国的巨大变革, 产生影响。总统的权力和影响力处于历史最低水平，国会腐败盛行。**州和市领导人也参与了腐败行为，而公众基本上不知情。*就像在殖民时期一样，美国人不会听从上级的命令; 相反，他们正在从基础上建立一个新社会。*

[.my1]
.案例
====
.graft
-> 来自PIE*gerbh, 刮，刻，切，词源同carve,graph. 用于植物学术语嫁接，即把切下来的一种植物移植到另一种植物上。俚语义行贿，即切下留作己用。比较 bribe.
====

The American Presidents who resided in the White House from the end of the Civil War until the 1890s `谓` are sometimes called "THE FORGETTABLE PRESIDENTS." A case-by-case 具体分析；个例 study helps (v.) illustrates this point.

[.my2]
**从内战结束, 到 1890 年代, 一直居住在白宫的美国总统, 有时被称为“被遗忘的总统”。**个案研究有助于说明这一点。

ANDREW JOHNSON was so hated /he was impeached and would have been removed from office /were it not for a single Senate vote.

[.my2]
安德鲁·约翰逊（Andrew Johnson）如此令人憎恨，他被弹劾，如果没有参议院的一次投票，他就会被免职。

A Soldier in the White House
白宫里的一名士兵

ULYSSES S. GRANT was a war hero but was unprepared for public office. +
He had not held a single _elected office_ prior (a.)先前的；较早的；在前的 to the Presidency and was totally naive to the workings of Washington. +
He relied heavily on the advice of insiders who were stealing public money. +
His secretary of war sold Indian land to investors and pocketed (v.)把……放入衣袋；把……占为己有，攫取；赚下 public money. +
His private secretary worked with officials in the Treasury Department to steal (v.) money raised from the tax on whiskey.

[.my2]
尤利西斯·s·格兰特是一位战争英雄，但他对担任公职毫无准备。在担任总统之前，他没有担任过任何一个民选公职，对华盛顿的运作完全不了解。他严重依赖"那些窃取公款的内部人士"的建议。他的战争部长, 把印第安人的土地卖给投资者，却把公共资金收入囊中。他的私人秘书与财政部官员合作，窃取从"威士忌税"中所得的钱。

Many members of his Administration 管理部门，行政部门 were implicated (v.)牵涉，涉及（某人） in the CRÉDIT MOBILIER SCANDAL, which *defrauded* (v.)骗取，诈取（…的钱财） the American public *of* common land 公共土地. +

[.my2]
他的政府的许多成员都与 CRÉDIT MOBILIER丑闻 有牵连，该丑闻骗取了美国公众的公共土地。格兰特本人似乎不受这些丑闻的影响，但他缺乏政治技巧, 来控制下属, 或用正直的官员取代他们。


[.my1]

.ULYSSES S. GRANT
image:/img/ULYSSES S. GRANT.jpg[,30%]

尤利西斯·格兰特.



.The Crédit Mobilier Scandal 動產信用公司醜聞
受政府委託興建"太平洋鐵路"的動產信用公司（Crédit Mobilier）, 利用其股份, 賄賂總統尤利西斯・辛普森・格蘭特的行政團隊，其中包括副總統、白宮發言人, 以及幾位"眾議院"議員，藉此確保該公司能獲得聯邦政府的支撐, 來完成這項美洲大陸的大型鐵路計劃。該事件始於格蘭特擔任總統前的1867年，卻在1872年才見光。

.defraud
(v.) ~ sb (of sth) : to get money illegally from a person or an organization by tricking them骗取，诈取（…的钱财）)

====


His successor was RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.
Hayes himself had tremendous 巨大的；极大的 integrity 诚实正直, but his Presidency 总统（主席，校长）的职位（任期） was weakened by the means of his election. +
After _the electoral votes_ 选举人票 were counted, his opponent, SAMUEL TILDEN, already claimed a majority 大部分；大多数 of _the popular vote_ and needed just one electoral vote to win.
Hayes needed twenty. +

Precisely 恰好，正是（表示强调） twenty _electoral votes_ were in dispute because the states submitted double returns 票 — one proclaiming Hayes the victor, the other Tilden.  +
A Republican-biased electoral commission `谓` *awarded* (v.)授予，颁发；判给，裁定 all 20 electoral votes *to* the Republican Hayes, and he won by just one electoral vote.

[.my2]
他的继任者是卢瑟福德·B·海斯。海斯本人具有极高的廉正品质，但他的总统任期因选举手段而受到削弱。在选举选票被计算后，他的对手塞缪尔·蒂尔登已经宣称赢得了多数选民的支持，只需再赢得一张选举选票即可获胜。而海斯则需要二十张。恰好有二十张选举选票存在争议，因为各州提交了双份选票——一份宣称海斯获胜，另一份宣称蒂尔登获胜。一个对共和党有利的选举委员会, 将这二十张选举选票全部授予了共和党的海斯，他最终以仅仅一张选举选票的优势获胜。

.1876年美国总统选举

[.my3]
[cols="1a,3a,3a"]
|===
||民主党 |共和党

|
|
|美国内战结束，共和党掌控了联邦政府，开始在南方推行政治重建和北方模式的经济发展.

|候选人
|Samuel Jones Tilden
|Rutherford Birchard Hayes

|普选票
|51%
|48%

|选举人票
|不少历史学家认为，南方的政治领袖们私下跟海斯的支持者达成协议，推举他任总统，但作为交换，海斯同意将联邦军队撤离南方，南部各州恢复「自治」。
|还有来自4个州的20张选举人票悬而未决.  +
结果是海斯以185票对184票淘汰蒂尔顿，当选总统。这个结果被称为「1877年妥协」。 +
1877年妥协案没有留下任何书面证据，其具体细节仍有争议。

|===

这笔政治交易带来的影响是 : 1.避免了第二次内战爆发，2.宣告「南方重建」终结，而获得自由不久的黑人的境遇再度恶化。
====

While he was able to claim the White House, many considered (v.) his election a fraud, and his power to rule was diminished.

[.my2]
虽然他能够入主白宫，但许多人认为他的选举是欺诈，他的统治权力也被削弱了。

Assassination 暗杀

JAMES GARFIELD succeeded (v.)接替；继任；随后出现 Hayes to the Presidency.
After only four months, his life was cut short 缩短；打断；缩减 by an assassin's bullet.

[.my2]
詹姆斯·加菲尔德, 接替海斯担任总统。仅仅四个月后，他就被刺客的子弹夺去了生命。


Vice-President CHESTER ARTHUR became the next leader. +
Although his political history was largely *composed (a.)由…组成（或构成）的 of* appointments of friends, the tragedy that befell (v.)降临；发生 his predecessor led him to believe that the system had gone bad. +
He *signed into law* the PENDLETON CIVIL SERVICE ACT, which *opened* many jobs *to* competitive exam （笔头、口头或操作）考试 rather than political connections. +
The Republican Party rewarded him by refusing (v.) his nomination for the Presidency in 1884.

[.my2]
副总统切斯特·阿瑟 (CHESTER ARTHUR) 成为下一任领导人。尽管他的政治历史, 主要是由"任命朋友"组成的，但发生在他前任身上的悲剧让他相信这个制度已经变坏了。他签署了《彭德尔顿公务员法》，使许多工作机会进入竞争性考试，而不是靠政治裙带关系。 1884 年，共和党拒绝了他的总统提名，以此作为对他的"奖励"。


[.my1]
====
.Chester Alan Arthur
切斯特·艾伦·阿瑟，1881年当选第20任美国副总统. 同年九月, 詹姆斯·艾布拉姆·加菲尔德总统在遇刺两个月后身亡，阿瑟当上第21任美国总统。倡导并实施《彭德尔顿公务员改革法》.


.1883年文官制度法
对于阿瑟的任期来说，*最大的功绩被认为是改革文官制度。此前，美国政界长期流行“政党分肥制”，根据这种制度，在大选中获胜的党派依据“战利品归胜利者所有”的规则，可以取得政府机构中的各种职位。党的领导人利用这一制度可以用官职来做政治交易，培植亲信。这样，每次大选后，政府人员大量更换。*

阿瑟深感这种“分赃”制度的弊端，在他的敦促下，国会在1863年1月16日通过了**《彭德尔顿法》。该法禁止在竞选总统时利用政府职位去拉票，并规定政府中10%的职位需通过文官考试聘用人员.** +
**但这一制度仅适用于低级文职人员，至于当选总统任命政府主要人员，仍是按党派关系来选定。**

该法自1883年通过以采沿用了近一个世纪，适用范围不断扩大，但基本条文没有什么改变。直至1978年吉米·卡特总统时期，才对条文作了修改。
====

One President impeached, one President drowning in corruption, one President elected by possible fraud, one President assassinated, and one disgraced by his own party for doing what he thought was right. +
Clearly this was not a good time in Presidential history.

[.my2]
*一位总统被弹劾，一位总统陷入腐败，一位总统因可能存在的舞弊而当选，一位总统被暗杀，一位总统因为做了他认为正确的事情而被自己的政党羞辱。显然，这不是总统历史上的好时机。*



This was an era of CONGRESSIONAL SUPREMACY 霸权，至高无上；优势. +
The REPUBLICAN PARTY dominated the Presidency and the Congress for most of these years. +
Both _houses of Congress_ 国会议院 were full of representatives owned by big business.

[.my2]
这是一个"国会至上"的时代。这些年来的大部分时间里，"共和党"在"总统"职位和"国会"中, 占据主导地位。国会参众两院, 都是大企业的代表。

Laws 后定 regulating (v.) campaigns 管理竞选活动的法律 `系`  were minimal 极小的；极少的；最小的 /and big money bought (v.) a government that would not interfere.
Similar conditions existed in the states. +
City governments were dominated by political machines.
Members of a small network gained power and used the public treasury （城堡等中的）金银财宝库，宝库 to stay in power — and grow fabulously 难以置信地；惊人地 rich in the process.

[.my2]
"监管竞选活动"的法律很少，而大笔资金, 就可以收买到一个"不会进行干预的政府"。类似的情况在各州也存在。市政府被政治机器所控制。一个小圈子网络的成员, 获得了权力，并利用公共财政来维护自己的权力，并在此过程中变得非常富有。

Not until 直到…才 the dawn of the 20th century *would* serious attempts *be made* to correct the abuses 滥用；妄用 of Gilded Age government.

[.my2]
直到二十世纪初，人们才认真尝试纠正"镀金时代"政府的弊端。

'''

=== Organized Labor 有组织的劳工

In the mid-19th century, the vast majority of American work was still done on the farm. +
By the turn of the 20th century, the United States economy revolved 旋转；环绕；转动 around the FACTORY.

[.my2]
19世纪中叶，美国绝大多数工作仍然在农场完成。到了 20 世纪之交，美国经济以工厂为中心。

Most Americans living in the Gilded Age knew nothing of the millions of Rockefeller, Carnegie and Morgan. +
They worked 10 hour shifts 班；轮班；轮班工作时间, 6 days a week, for wages barely enough to survive. +
Children as young as eight years old `谓` worked hours that kept them out of school. +
Men and women worked until their bodies could stand no more, only to *be released 免除，解除（某人的职责、责任、合同等）；解雇 from* employment /without _retirement benefits_ 退休金；退休福利. +
Medical coverage 医疗保险 did not exist. +
Women who became pregnant were often fired. +
Compensation for _being hurt while on the job_ `系` was zero.

[.my2]
大多数生活在镀金时代的美国人, 对数以百万计的洛克菲勒、卡内基和摩根一无所知。他们每周工作 6 天，轮班 10 小时，工资勉强维持生计。年仅八岁的儿童因工作时间而无法上学。男人和女人一直工作到身体无法忍受为止，然后才被解雇，没有退休金。不存在医疗保险。怀孕的妇女经常被解雇。在工作中受伤的赔偿为零。



Soon laborers realized that they must unite to demand change. +
Even though they lacked money, education, or political power, they knew one critical thing.
There were simply more workers *than* there were owners.

[.my2]
*很快，工人们意识到, 他们必须团结起来要求变革。尽管他们缺乏金钱、教育或政治权力，但他们知道一件重要的事情。工人的数量比业主的数量还要多。*

UNIONS did not emerge overnight. +
Despite their legal rights to exist, bosses often took extreme measures, including intimidation 恫吓，威胁 and violence, to prevent a union from taking hold (影响；左右力；控制) 开始完全控制；变得十分强大. +
Workers, too, often chose the sword when peaceful measures failed.

[.my2]
UNIONs 并非一夜之间出现的。尽管老板们拥有合法的生存权利，但他们经常采取极端措施，包括恐吓和暴力，以阻止工会成立。*当和平措施失败时，工人们也常常选择武力。*

[.my1]
.案例
====
.take (a) ˈhold
to begin to have complete control over sb/sth; to become very strong 开始完全控制；变得十分强大
====


Many Americans believed that a violent revolution would take place in America. +
How long would so many stand (v.) to be poor? Industrial titans including John Rockefeller `谓` arranged (v.)安排，筹备 for mighty castles to be built as fortresses 城堡；堡垒；要塞；设防的地方 to stand against the upheaval 剧变；激变；动乱；动荡 they were sure was coming.

[.my2]
**许多美国人相信美国将发生一场暴力革命。**这么多人还要贫穷多久？包括约翰·洛克菲勒在内的工业巨头, 安排建造了宏伟的城堡作为堡垒，以抵御他们确信即将到来的剧变。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.upheaval
-> up,向上，heave,举起。引申词义剧变，动乱。
====

Slowly but surely unions 工会 did grow. +
Efforts to form (v.) nationwide organizations `谓` faced even greater difficulties.
Federal troops were sometimes called to block their efforts.
Judges almost always ruled (v.) in favor of the bosses.

[.my2]
工会确实在缓慢但确定地发展中。组建全国性组织的努力面临着更大的困难。有时联邦军队会被召集来阻止他们的行动。而法官几乎总是做出有利于老板的裁决。

'''

==== 劳工采取的策略

The workers often could not *agree on* common goals 共同的目标.
Some *flirted (v.)调情 with* extreme ideas like Marxism 马克思主义.
Others simply wanted a nickel （金属）镍；（美国或加拿大的）五分硬币 more per hour. +
Fights erupted over _whether or not_ to admit 准许…进入（某处） women or African Americans.
Immigrants were often viewed with hostile eyes. +
Most did *agree on* one major issue — the eight-hour day.
But even that agreement was often not strong enough glue (n.) to hold the group together.

[.my2]
**工人们常常无法就共同目标达成一致。**有些人热衷于马克思主义等极端思想。其他人只是想要每小时多赚五分钱。关于是否接纳女性或非裔美国人的争论爆发了。移民常常遭到敌视。*大多数人确实在一个重大问题上达成了一致——八小时工作制。但即使是这样的共识, 也常常不足以将团队凝聚在一起。*

Organized labor has *brought* tremendous positive change *to* working (a.)做工的；从事体力劳动的;有工作的；有职业的 Americans.
Today, many workers enjoy higher wages, better hours, and safer working conditions.
Employers often pay for _medical coverage_ and several weeks vacation. +
Jobs and lives were lost in the epic 具有史诗性质的；史诗般的 struggle for a fair share 合理的份额.
The fight sprouted (v.)（植物）发芽;出现；（使）涌现出 during the Gilded Age, when labor took its first steps toward unity.
It began with the Great Upheaval.

[.my2]
**有组织的劳工, 给美国工薪阶层带来了巨大的积极变化。**如今，许多工人享受着更高的工资、更好的工作时间, 和更安全的工作条件 (*所以一切权利都是斗争来的*)。雇主通常支付医疗保险和几周的假期。**在争夺公平份额的史诗般的斗争中，人们失去了工作和生命。**这场斗争在"镀金时代"开始萌芽，*当时"工党"迈出了团结的第一步*。这要从大动乱开始。



The most frequently _employed 应用；运用；使用 technique_ of workers was the STRIKE 罢工. +
*Withholding* (v.)拒绝给；不给 labor *from* management `谓` would, in theory, force (v.) the company to suffer (v.) great enough _financial losses_ that they would agree to worker terms. +
Strikes have been known in America since the colonial age, but their numbers grew larger in the Gilded Age.

[.my2]
工人最常用的方法是罢工。从理论上讲，拒绝向管理层提供劳动力, 会迫使公司遭受足够大的财务损失，以至于他们会同意工人条款。美国自殖民时代起就开始罢工，但在镀金时代, 罢工的数量变得越来越多。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Withhold
[ VN] ~ sth (from sb/sth)  : ( formal ) to refuse to give sth to sb拒绝给；不给 +
SYN keep back +
• She was accused of withholding information from the police. 她被指控对警方知情不报。
====

Most 19th century strikes were not successful, so unions *thought of* other means. +
If the workers at a shoe factory `谓` could garner (v.)获得，得到，收集（信息、支持等） enough sympathy from the local townspeople 镇民；市民, a BOYCOTT 抵制行动 could achieve (v.) desirable 想望的；可取的；值得拥有的；值得做的 results. +

The union would *make its case （在审判、讨论等中支持一方的）论据，理由，辩词 to the town* in the hope that no one would buy any shoes from the factory until the owners agreed to a pay raise 加薪. +
Boycotts could be successful in a small community where the factory was dependent upon the business of a group of people in close proximity （时间或空间）接近，邻近，靠近.

[.my2]
**19世纪的大多数罢工, 都没有成功，因此工会想到了其他手段。**如果鞋厂的工人能够获得当地居民足够的同情(即居民和工人联合起来, 对资本家的产品进行抵制)，抵制运动就能取得理想的效果。**工会将向镇上表明立场，希望在工厂主同意加薪之前，没有人会从工厂购买鞋子。**在工厂依赖附近一群人的生意的小社区里，抵制可能会成功.

[.my1]
.案例
====
.garner
-> 来自granary的拼写变体，词源同grain, 原指谷仓。后用做动词，指收集。

.proximity
(n.) ~ (of sb/sth) (to sb/sth)  : ( formal ) the state of being near sb/sth in distance or time（时间或空间）接近，邻近，靠近 +

Occasionally, the foreman 领班；工头 or the owner might even be the victims of worker-sponsored （活动）有组织赞助的 violence.

[.my2]
**危急时刻，工人们在必要时也会诉诸非法手段。**例如，工厂设备遭到破坏的情况并不鲜见。有时，工头或工厂主, 甚至可能成为工人发起的暴力行为的受害者。

'''

==== 资方采取的策略

Owners had strategies of their own. +
If a company found itself with a high inventory （商店的）存货，库存, the boss might afford (v.)承担得起（后果） to enact a LOCKOUT 闭厂，停工, which is a reverse (a.)相反的；反面的；反向的 strike. +
In this case, the owner tells the employees not to bother (v.) showing up 出现,到场,现身 until they agree to a pay cut 减薪. +

=== The Gilded Age



From the ashes of the American Civil War sprung an economic powerhouse.


The growth was astounding. From the end of RECONSTRUCTION in 1877 to the disastrous PANIC OF 1893, the American economy nearly doubled in size. New technologies and new ways of organizing business led a few individuals to the top. The competition was ruthless. Those who could not provide the best product at the cheapest price were simply driven into bankruptcy or were bought up by hungry, successful industrialists.



The so-called captains of industry became household names: John D. Rockefeller of Standard Oil, Andrew Carnegie of Carnegie Steel, and J. Pierpont Morgan, the powerful banker who controlled a great many industries. Their tactics were not always fair, but there were few laws regulating business conduct at that time.



The "Molly Maguires" were a band of 19th century Irish immigrant laborers who struggled to survive in American industry. They organized labor unions and were not averse to violence, as this "coffin notice," delivered to three bosses, suggests.




Nevertheless, the American economy grew and grew. By 1914, the small nation once seen as a playground for European empires had now surpassed them all. The United States had become the largest industrial nation in the world.

However, the prosperity of America did not reach everyone. Amid the fabulous wealth of the new economic elite was tremendous poverty. How did some manage to be so successful while others struggled to put food on the table? Americans wrestled with this great question as new attitudes toward wealth began to emerge.

What role did the government play in this trend? Basically, it was pro-business. Congress, the Presidents, and the Courts looked favorably on this new growth. But leadership was generally lacking on the political level. CORRUPTION spread like a plague through the city, state, and national governments. Greedy legislators and "forgettable" Presidents dominated the political scene.

True leadership, for better or for worse, resided among the magnates who dominated the Gilded Age.



'''

==== Politics of the Gilded Age

The Gilded Age will be remembered for the accomplishments of thousands of American thinkers, inventors, entrepreneurs, writers, and promoters of social justice. Few politicians had an impact on the tremendous change transforming America. The Presidency was at an all-time low in power and influence, and the Congress was rife with corruption. State and city leaders shared in the graft, and the public was kept largely unaware. Much like in the colonial days, Americans were not taking their orders from the top; rather, they were building a new society from its foundation.

The American Presidents who resided in the White House from the end of the Civil War until the 1890s are sometimes called "THE FORGETTABLE PRESIDENTS." A case-by-case study helps illustrates this point.

ANDREW JOHNSON was so hated he was impeached and would have been removed from office were it not for a single Senate vote.

A Soldier in the White House

ULYSSES S. GRANT was a war hero but was unprepared for public office. He had not held a single elected office prior to the Presidency and was totally naive to the workings of Washington. He relied heavily on the advice of insiders who were stealing public money. His secretary of war sold Indian land to investors and pocketed public money. His private secretary worked with officials in the Treasury Department to steal money raised from the tax on whiskey.

Many members of his Administration were implicated in the CRÉDIT MOBILIER SCANDAL, which defrauded the American public of common land. Grant himself seemed above these scandals, but lacked the political skill to control his staff or replace them with officers of integrity.




His successor was RUTHERFORD B. HAYES. Hayes himself had tremendous integrity, but his Presidency was weakened by the means of his election. After the electoral votes were counted, his opponent, SAMUEL TILDEN, already claimed a majority of the popular vote and needed just one electoral vote to win. Hayes needed twenty. Precisely twenty electoral votes were in dispute because the states submitted double returns — one proclaiming Hayes the victor, the other Tilden. A Republican-biased electoral commission awarded all 20 electoral votes to the Republican Hayes, and he won by just one electoral vote.

While he was able to claim the White House, many considered his election a fraud, and his power to rule was diminished.

Assassination

JAMES GARFIELD succeeded Hayes to the Presidency. After only four months, his life was cut short by an assassin's bullet.


Vice-President CHESTER ARTHUR became the next leader. Although his political history was largely composed of appointments of friends, the tragedy that befell his predecessor led him to believe that the system had gone bad. He signed into law the PENDLETON CIVIL SERVICE ACT, which opened many jobs to competitive exam rather than political connections. The Republican Party rewarded him by refusing his nomination for the Presidency in 1884.



One President impeached, one President drowning in corruption, one President elected by possible fraud, one President assassinated, and one disgraced by his own party for doing what he thought was right. Clearly this was not a good time in Presidential history.



This was an era of CONGRESSIONAL SUPREMACY. The REPUBLICAN PARTY dominated the Presidency and the Congress for most of these years. Both houses of Congress were full of representatives owned by big business.

Laws regulating campaigns were minimal and big money bought a government that would not interfere. Similar conditions existed in the states. City governments were dominated by political machines. Members of a small network gained power and used the public treasury to stay in power — and grow fabulously rich in the process.

Not until the dawn of the 20th century would serious attempts be made to correct the abuses of Gilded Age government.

=== Organized Labor

In the mid-19th century, the vast majority of American work was still done on the farm. By the turn of the 20th century, the United States economy revolved around the FACTORY.

Most Americans living in the Gilded Age knew nothing of the millions of Rockefeller, Carnegie and Morgan. They worked 10 hour shifts, 6 days a week, for wages barely enough to survive. Children as young as eight years old worked hours that kept them out of school. Men and women worked until their bodies could stand no more, only to be released from employment without retirement benefits. Medical coverage did not exist. Women who became pregnant were often fired. Compensation for being hurt while on the job was zero.



Soon laborers realized that they must unite to demand change. Even though they lacked money, education, or political power, they knew one critical thing. There were simply more workers than there were owners.

UNIONS did not emerge overnight. Despite their legal rights to exist, bosses often took extreme measures, including intimidation and violence, to prevent a union from taking hold. Workers, too, often chose the sword when peaceful measures failed.

Many Americans believed that a violent revolution would take place in America. How long would so many stand to be poor? Industrial titans including John Rockefeller arranged for mighty castles to be built as fortresses to stand against the upheaval they were sure was coming.

Slowly but surely unions did grow. Efforts to form nationwide organizations faced even greater difficulties. Federal troops were sometimes called to block their efforts. Judges almost always ruled in favor of the bosses.

The workers often could not agree on common goals. Some flirted with extreme ideas like Marxism. Others simply wanted a nickel more per hour. Fights erupted over whether or not to admit women or African Americans. Immigrants were often viewed with hostile eyes. Most did agree on one major issue — the eight-hour day. But even that agreement was often not strong enough glue to hold the group together.

Organized labor has brought tremendous positive change to working Americans. Today, many workers enjoy higher wages, better hours, and safer working conditions. Employers often pay for medical coverage and several weeks vacation. Jobs and lives were lost in the epic struggle for a fair share. The fight sprouted during the Gilded Age, when labor took its first steps toward unity. It began with the Great Upheaval.



The most frequently employed technique of workers was the STRIKE. Withholding labor from management would, in theory, force the company to suffer great enough financial losses that they would agree to worker terms. Strikes have been known in America since the colonial age, but their numbers grew larger in the Gilded Age.

Most 19th century strikes were not successful, so unions thought of other means. If the workers at a shoe factory could garner enough sympathy from the local townspeople, a BOYCOTT could achieve desirable results. The union would make its case to the town in the hope that no one would buy any shoes from the factory until the owners agreed to a pay raise. Boycotts could be successful in a small community where the factory was dependent upon the business of a group of people in close proximity

In desperate times, workers would also resort to illegal means if necessary. For example, SABOTAGE of factory equipment was not unknown. Occasionally, the foreman or the owner might even be the victims of worker-sponsored violence.

==== 资方采取的策略

Owners had strategies of their own. If a company found itself with a high inventory, the boss might afford to enact a LOCKOUT, which is a reverse strike. In this case, the owner tells the employees not to bother showing up until they agree to a pay cut. Sometimes when a new worker was hired the employee was forced to sign a YELLOW-DOG CONTRACT, or an ironclad oath swearing that the employee would never join a union.

Strikes could be countered in a variety of ways. The first measure was usually to hire strikebreakers, or SCABS, to take the place of the regular labor force. Here things often turned violent. The crowded cities always seemed to have someone hopeless enough to "CROSS THE PICKET LINE" during a strike. The striking workers often responded with fists, occasionally even leading to death.



Prior to the 20th century the government never sided with the union in a labor dispute. Bosses persuaded the courts to issue injunctions to declare a strike illegal. If the strike continued, the participants would be thrown into prison. When all these efforts failed to break a strike, the government at all levels would be willing to send a militia to regulate as in the case of the Great Upheaval.


Divide and conquer. That simple strategy gave the owners the advantage over labor until the dawn of the 20th century. Laborers did not all have the same goals. By favoring one group over another, the bosses could create internal dissent in any union. Unions were spread from town to town. Unity among them might make a more effective boycott or strike, but bringing diverse groups together across a large area was extremely difficult.

Owners were smart enough to circulate BLACKLISTS. These lists contained the names of any workers active in the union. If anyone on the list would show up in another town trying to get hired (or to start another union), the employers would be wise. Still, the ratio of labor to management was so large that national organization was inevitable. The first group to clear the hurdles was the National Labor Union.

==== National Labor Union

William Sylvis worked in many trades in his life, from wagon making to canal boat building. Later, he became a pioneer in organizing and motivating labor unions.

By 1866, there were about 200,000 workers in local unions across the United States. WILLIAM SYLVIS seized the opportunity presented by these numbers and established the first nationwide labor organization, named the NATIONAL LABOR UNION. Sylvis had very ambitious goals. Not only did the NLU fight for higher wages and shorter hours, Sylvis took labor activity into the political arena. The NLU supported legislation banning PRISON LABOR, land reform laws to keep public holdings out of the hands of speculators, and national currency reform to raise farm prices.

It brought together skilled and unskilled workers, as well as farmers. The National Labor Union stopped short of admitting African Americans. RACIST tendencies of the times prevailed, despite the wisdom of bringing as many workers as possible into the fold. Unfortunately for the NLU, it tried to represent too many different groups. Farmers had their own agenda, and skilled workers often had different realities than the unskilled. When the Panic of 1873 hit America, the union was severely disabled. Soon after, the National Labor Union withered away.

==== The KNIGHTS OF LABOR

The KNIGHTS OF LABOR soon inherited the mantle of organized labor. Begun by URIAH STEPHENS as a secret society in 1869, the Knights admitted all wage earners into their ranks, including women and African Americans. The philosophy was simple: class was more important than race or gender. For such a group to influence the federal government, complete solidarity would be required.



The Knights supported the entire political agenda of the NLU and more. They advocated limits on immigration, restrictions on child labor, and government ownership of railroads, telegraphs, and telephones. At the height of its membership in 1886, the Knights boasted 750,000 workers. But then disaster struck.


On May 1, 1886, INTERNATIONAL WORKERS DAY, local chapters of the Knights went on strike demanding an eight-hour day for all laborers. At a rally in HAYMARKET SQUARE in Chicago on May 4, someone threw a bomb into the crowd. One police officer died and several crowd members sustained injuries.

Who was responsible? No one was really sure, but the American press, government, and general public blamed the Knights of Labor. Leader TERENCE POWDERLY condemned the bombing to no avail. Americans associated labor activity with anarchists and mob violence. Membership began to fall. Soon the Knights were merely a shadow of their former size. But labor leaders had learned some valuable lessons. The next national organization of workers would endure.

==== American Federation of Labor

Keep it simple. That was the mantra of labor leader SAMUEL GOMPERS. He was a diehard capitalist and saw no need for a radical restructuring of America. Gompers quickly learned that the issues that workers cared about most deeply were personal. They wanted higher wages and better working conditions. These "BREAD AND BUTTER" issues would always unite the labor class. By keeping it simple, unions could avoid the pitfalls that had drawn the life from the National Labor Union and the Knights of Labor.


In December of 1886, the same year the Knights of Labor was dealt its fatal blow at Haymarket Square, Gompers met with the leaders of other craft unions to form the AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR. The A.F. of L. was a loose grouping of smaller craft unions, such as the masons' union, the hatmakers' union or Gompers's own cigarmakers' union. Every member of the A.F. of L. was therefore a skilled worker.



Gompers had no visions of uniting the entire working class. Tradespeople were in greater demand and already earned higher wages than their unskilled counterparts. Gompers knew that the A.F. of L. would have more political and economic power if unskilled workers were excluded. He served as president of the union every year except one until his death in 1924.

Although conservative in nature, Gompers was not afraid to call for a strike or a boycott. The larger A.F. of L. could be used to support these actions, as well as provide relief for members engaged in a work stoppage. By refusing to pursue a radical program for political change, Gompers maintained the support of the American government and public. By 1900, the ranks of the A.F. of L. swelled to over 500,000 tradespeople. Gompers was seen as the unofficial leader of the labor world in America.

Simplicity worked. Although the bosses still had the upper hand with the government, unions were growing in size and status. There were over 20,000 strikes in America in the last two decades of the 19th century. Workers lost about half, but in many cases their demands were completely or partially met. The A.F. of L. served as the preeminent national labor organization until the Great Depression when unskilled workers finally came together. Smart leadership, patience, and realistic goals made life better for the hundreds of thousands of working Americans it served.

==== Eugene V. Debs and American Socialism


Despite the success of the American Federation of Labor, American RADICALISM was not dead. The number of those who felt the American capitalist system was fundamentally flawed was in fact growing fast.

American SOCIALISTS based their beliefs on the writings of KARL MARX, the German philosopher. Many asked why so many working Americans should have so little while a few owners grew incredibly wealthy. No wealth could exist without the sweat and blood of its workforce. They suggested that the government should own all industries and divide the profits among those who actually created the products. While the current management class would stand to lose, many more people would gain. These radicals grew in number as industries spread. But their enemies were legion.

The Father of American Socialism

EUGENE V. DEBS was born in Terre Haute, Indiana in 1855 to a family of French Alsatian immigrants. Making his way in the railroad industry, Debs formed the AMERICAN RAILWAY UNION in 1892.

Two years later he found himself leading one of the largest strikes in American history — the great PULLMAN STRIKE.

Debs was not originally a socialist, but his experience with the Pullman Strike and his subsequent six-month jail term led him to believe that drastic action was necessary. Debs chose to confine his activity to the political arena. In 1900 he ran for President as a socialist and garnered some 87,000 votes.



The following year, leading sympathizers joined with him to form the SOCIALIST PARTY. At its height, the party numbered over 100,000 active members. Debs ran for President four more times. In the election of 1912 he received over 900,000 votes. After being arrested for antiwar activities during World War I, he ran for President from his jail cell and polled 919,000 votes. Debs died in 1926 having never won an election, but over one thousand Socialist Party members were elected to state and city governments.
