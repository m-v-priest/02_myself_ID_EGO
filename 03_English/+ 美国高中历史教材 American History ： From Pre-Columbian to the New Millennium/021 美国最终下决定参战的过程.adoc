=== The Road to Pearl Harbor 通往珍珠港之路



Storm clouds were darkening around the world. +
While Americans struggled *to make ends meet* 收支相抵 during the Great Depression, fascism swept (v.) Italy and Germany. +
Remembering the scars 疤痕；创伤 caused by WORLD WAR I, Americans *hoped against hope* 不抱希望地希望,抱一线希望 to remain aloof (a.)冷漠；冷淡 from the increasingly dangerous world.

[.my2]
世界各地的暴风云, 正在变暗。当美国人在大萧条期间努力维持生计时，法西斯主义席卷了意大利和德国。美国人铭记第一次世界大战造成的伤痕，希望能够远离这个日益危险的世界。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.make ends meet
to have just enough money to pay for the things that you need  形容收入和支出达到平衡，收支相抵。

.hope against hope
意思是 “某人寄希望于一件不太可能发生的事情”。它有时也用来表达某人在绝望的情况下抱着一线希望。

.cling
(v.) ~ (on) to sb/sth | ~ on/together : to hold on tightly to sb/sth 抓紧；紧握；紧抱 +
• survivors clinging to a raft 紧紧抓住救生筏的幸存者

Yet when Great Britain became the last bastion 堡垒；棱堡 of freedom standing against a Nazi-controlled Europe, Americans reluctantly began to act. +
Led by President Roosevelt, the United States used its industrial might to become the arsenal 兵工厂；军械库；武器；军火库 of democracy for the Allied (a.)（国与国协同作战）结盟的，联盟的；（第一次世界大战期间）协约国的；（第二次世界大战期间）同盟国的 war effort.

[.my2]
然而，当英国成为对抗纳粹控制的欧洲的最后自由堡垒时，美国人不情愿地开始采取行动。在罗斯福总统的领导下，美国利用其工业实力, 成为盟军战争努力的民主武器库。

In the end, it was Japan who provoked 激起，引起;挑衅，激怒  the United States into war. +
The United States was the only nation standing against Japanese domination 控制，统治 of the entire PACIFIC RIM. +
When economic sanctions against Japan produced a diplomatic stalemate 僵局；陷于困境, Japan launched a ruthless surprise attack 突然袭击 against American naval bases at Pearl 珍珠 Harbor 港，海港；避难所. +

==== 1930s Isolationism 20世纪30年代孤立主义


"Leave me alone," seemed to be _America's attitude_ toward the rest of the world in the 1930s.

[.my2]
“别管我”, 似乎是 20 世纪 30 年代美国对世界其他国家的态度。

At the dawn of the '30s, foreign policy was not a burning issue for the average American. +
The stock market had just crashed /and _each passing month_ brought greater and greater hardships. +
American involvement with Europe `谓` had brought war in 1917 and unpaid (a.) debt throughout the 1920s. +

Having grown weary (a.)使人疲劳的；使人厌烦的 with the course 进展；进程 of world events, citizens were convinced 使确信，使信服 `主` the most important issues to be tackled `系` were domestic. +
Foreign policy leaders of the 1930s `谓` once again led (v.) the country down its well-traveled 游历甚广的；交通繁忙的 path of isolationism.

[.my2]
三十年代初期，对于普通美国人来说, "外交政策"并不是一个紧迫的问题。股市刚刚崩盘，每个月都带来越来越大的困难。美国对欧洲的介入, 导致了 1917 年的战争, 和整个 20 年代的未偿债务。由于对世界事件的进程感到厌倦，公民们相信要解决的最重要的问题是"国内问题"。 20世纪30年代的外交政策领导人, 再次带领该国走上了"孤立主义"的老路。

[.my1]
.案例
====
这段话里的 "well-traveled" 意思是“常走的”或“熟悉的”。因此，"well-traveled path of isolationism" 可以翻译为“经常走的孤立主义道路”或“熟悉的孤立主义道路”。
====

The Hoover Administration set the tone for an isolationist foreign policy with the Hawley-Smoot Tariff 关税. +
Trade often dominated international relations and `主` the protective wall of the tariff `谓` left little to discuss. +

The Far East became an area of concern when the Japanese government ordered an attack on CHINESE MANCHURIA 满洲（中国东北的旧称）. +
This invasion was a clear violation of the NINE POWER TREATY 九国公约, which prohibited nations from carving  雕，刻;把（熟肉）切成块  a special sphere of influence in China.

[.my2]
胡佛政府通过霍利-斯穆特关税, 为孤立主义外交政策, 定下了基调。贸易往往主导国际关系，关税保护墙几乎没有什么可讨论的。当日本政府下令进攻中国满洲时，远东成为一个令人担忧的地区。这次入侵明显违反了《九国公约》，该条约禁止各国在中国划定特殊势力范围。


[.my1]
.案例
====
.Nine-Power Treaty 九国公约
《九国条约》缺乏任何执行规章，当日本违反公约在在1931年入侵满洲和建立满洲国期间，美国除了表示抗议和施加经济制裁外无能为力。 1937年11月， 第二次中日战争爆发后，《九国条约》的签署国在布鲁塞尔召集了九国公约大会 ，不过无济于事。 但不管如何，该条约最终还是对"淞沪会战"的发生起到了一定的影响，使日军不敢大规模进攻。


."门户开放"政策
美国国务卿约翰·海伊于1899年9月至11月发出了有关门户开放政策的“公开信”，请求: +
- 所有在中国拥有特权的国家, 正式宣布将保持"门户开放"， +
- 在他们在中国的势力范围内的通商口岸，所有的国家都拥有平等的进出权利。 +
- 由于担心欧洲列强和日本正准备将中国瓜分为殖民地，海伊还增加了一些条款，*要求维护中国的领土和主权完整。*

1900年以后订立的条约, 都参考了门户开放政策 。

在日俄战争 （1904-1905）和二十一条（1915）之后，美国尤其对"日本对中国的意图"持怀疑态度，并多次与日本政府签署协议，要求日本承诺维持"满洲"和"中国其余地区"平等的政策 。 但这些协议随着1917年《 蓝辛—石井协议》的缔结，就被证明完全无效。

.Lansing–Ishii Agreement 蓝辛-石井协定
是在1917年11月2日签订，双方重申在中国尊重“门户开放”、“机会均等”及维持中国政权及领土完整等多项原则。*但同时，美国却又承认日本由于“地理上的接近”，在中国享有“特殊利益”。美国政府这一举动与其提倡之"门户开放"政策自相矛盾。*

美国总统哈定在1922年3月8日, 对参议院的信件中指出：1917年11月2日签署的**所谓《兰辛-石井协定》并不是条约，而是**美国国务卿与日本特命全权大使石井子爵**之间的公开声明。** 从本质上讲，这种交换意见只不过是行政政策的宣言。 这样的声明或交换照会, 不会产生任何与现有或之后生效的条约义务不一致的效力。

该协定曾被认为是美-日关系中的里程碑，但**由于换文内容含糊，有可能出现不同的演绎方式，故此该协定实际上并未有发挥重大作用。最终，该协定于1922年被废除，为华盛顿会议中达成的"九国公约"所取代。**

====


The Hoover Administration knew that any harsh action against JAPAN would be unpopular in the midst of the Great Depression. +
The official American response was the STIMSON DOCTRINE, which refused to recognize any territory illegally occupied by Japan. +
As meek (a.)温顺的；谦恭的；驯服的 as this may sound, it went *further* toward condemning Japan *than* the government of Great Britain was willing to do.

[.my2]
胡佛政府知道，在大萧条时期，任何针对日本的严厉行动都不会受欢迎。美国的官方回应是"史汀生主义"，拒绝承认任何被日本非法占领的领土。尽管这听起来可能很温和，但它对日本的谴责, 却超出了英国政府的意愿。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Stimson Doctrine 史汀生主义, 不承认主义
中国九一八事变后，美国国务卿亨利·刘易斯·史汀生于次年一月所宣示的美国官方立场。*该主义主张基于“不法行为不产生权利”原则，不承认以武力造成的国际领土变更。*

One possibility for international economic cooperation `谓` failed at the LONDON CONFERENCE OF 1933. +
Leaders of European nations hoped to increase trade and stabilize (v.) international currencies 货币. +
Roosevelt sent a "BOMBSHELL 炸弹；突发事件；引起震惊的人或事 MESSAGE" to the conference refusing any attempt to tie the American dollar to a gold standard. +
The conference dissolved 解除（婚姻关系）；终止（商业协议）；解散（议会） with _European delegates_ miffed (v.)使…恼怒 at the lack of cooperation by the United States.

[.my2]
国际经济合作的一种可能性, 在1933年的伦敦会议上失败了。欧洲国家领导人希望增加贸易, 并稳定国际货币。罗斯福向会议发出了“重磅炸弹消息”，拒绝任何将美元与金本位挂钩的尝试。会议解散，欧洲代表对美国缺乏合作感到愤怒。

Roosevelt did realize that the Hawley-Smoot Tariff was forestalling (v.)预先阻止；在（他人）之前行动；先发制人 American economic recovery. +
Toward this end, Congress did act (n.) to make United States trade policy more flexible. +

[.my2]
**罗斯福确实意识到霍利-斯穆特关税, 正在阻碍美国经济复苏。为此，国会确实采取了使美国贸易政策更加灵活的行动。**根据 1934 年互惠贸易协定，**国会授权总统与个别国家, 谈判关税税率。如果一个国家同意减少与美国的贸易壁垒，总统可以在未经国会同意的情况下做出回报。**此外，罗斯福通过正式承认苏联，打破了与苏联长达 16 年的外交冻结。罗斯福希望与苏联解决一些棘手的悬而未决的问题，同时刺激双边贸易。

The Japanese attack on Chinese Manchuria was in direct violation of the Nine Powers Treaty, which had been passed to prevent nations from establishing a special sphere of influence in China.

[.my2]
*日本对中国满洲的进攻, 直接违反了旨在阻止各国在中国建立特殊势力范围的《九国条约》。*

Isolationists did not however designate (v.)命名；指定;标明；标示；指明 the Western Hemisphere as a dangerous region. +
On the contrary, as tensions 紧张局势（或关系、状况） grew in Europe and Asia, a strong sense of PAN-AMERICANISM 泛美主义 swept the diplomatic circles. +

[.my2]
然而，孤立主义者并未将西半球指定为危险地区。相反，随着欧洲和亚洲紧张局势加剧，强烈的泛美主义情绪席卷了外交界。面对海外逆境，西半球的强大团结具有吸引力。为了与南方国家建立更好的关系，罗斯福宣布了一项大胆的新睦邻政策。驻扎在中美洲和加勒比地区的海军陆战队已撤出。宣布美国干预拉丁美洲事务的权利的（西奥多）罗斯福推论, 被放弃。

.FASCISM

法西斯主义（ /ˈfæʃɪzəm/ FASH-iz-əm）是一种极右翼、专制、极端民族主义的政治意识形态和运动. 法西斯主义被置于传统左右派中的极右翼。 +

- 独裁领导人、集权专制 +
- 相信自然的社会等级制度、个人利益服从于国家或种族的利益 +
- 对社会和经济的严格管制。
- 法西斯主义者经常主张建立极权主义的一党制国家， 和独裁者经济（国家通过经济干预政策发挥强有力的指导作用的市场经济），其主要目标是实现自给自足（国民经济自给自足）。 +
- 反对无政府主义、民主、多元主义、平等主义、自由主义、社会主义和马克思主义 +
- 将帝国主义、政治暴力和战争, 视为民族复兴的手段。 +

Historians, political scientists, and other scholars have long debated the exact nature of fascism. Historian Ian Kershaw once wrote that "trying to define 'fascism' is like trying to nail jelly to the wall." Each different group described as fascist has at least some unique elements, and many definitions of fascism have been criticized as either too broad or too narrow. According to many scholars, fascism—especially once in power—has historically attacked communism, conservatism, and parliamentary liberalism, attracting support primarily from the far-right.

历史学家、政治学家和其他学者长期以来一直在争论法西斯主义的确切性质。 [27] 历史学家伊恩·克肖 (Ian Kershaw) 曾经写道，“试图定义‘法西斯主义’就像试图将果冻钉在墙上。” [28] 每个被描述为法西斯主义的不同群体都至少有一些独特的元素，法西斯主义的许多定义都被批评为要么太宽泛，要么太狭隘。 [29] 根据许多学者的说法，法西斯主义——尤其是一旦掌权后——在历史上一直攻击共产主义、保守主义和议会自由主义，主要吸引了极右翼的支持。

Historian John Lukacs argues that there is no such thing as generic fascism. He claims that Nazism and communism are essentially manifestations of populism, and that states such as Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy are more different from each other than they are similar. +

历史学家约翰·卢卡奇认为，不存在一般的法西斯主义。他声称，纳粹主义和共产主义本质上都是民粹主义的表现，纳粹德国和法西斯意大利等国家之间的不同多于相似。




.MILITARISM 军国主义

- 国家应该保持强大的军事能力, 并积极利用它来扩大国家利益和/或价值观。
- 武装部队在国家管理或政策中的主导地位

历史上，军国主义一直是许多国家帝国主义或扩张主义意识形态的重要组成部分。包括罗马帝国、蒙古帝国, 日本的战国时代.

"现购自运"是 1939 年 9 月 21 日欧洲战争爆发后，美国总统富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福, 在美国国会联席会议上宣布的一项政策。它取代了 1937 年的《中立法案》，**根据该法案，交战方只能从美国购买非军事物资，只要接收者立即以现金支付，并承担"使用自己的船只来运输"的所有风险。**后来的修订，即 1939 年《中立法案》，允许在同样的"现购自运"基础上, 向交战方出售军事武器。

The first Neutrality Act was passed in August 1935. +
It was renewed in 1936 and later extended to May 1937. +
The Act forbade selling implements 工具；器具 of war /or lending money to belligerent countries under any terms （协议、合同等的）条件，条款. +
US passengers traveling on foreign ships were advised that they did so /at their own risk.


第一个中立法案于 1935 年 8 月通过，并于 1936 年更新，后来延长至 1937 年 5 月。该法案禁止以任何条件, 向交战国出售战争工具或贷款。乘坐外国船只的美国乘客被告知，他们需要自行承担风险。

.Lend-Lease Program 租借法案

是美国国会在第二次世界大战初期通过的一项法案，目的是在美国不卷入战争的同时，为同盟国提供战争物资，租借法案使得美国成为名副其实的“民主兵工厂”。

1939年9月纳粹德国入侵波兰，第二次世界大战欧洲战场正式爆发；欧洲各国重新整军经武，面临了军备青黄不接的艰困时期。**美国虽然有能力提供世界各国需要的武器，但是因美国"中立法"限制, 有很多严格的但书。一般所知的就有得"以现款或贵金属采购"，而"不得以贷款方式采购"（"现购自运"政策），且运输手段也有相当多的规范。**

美国总统罗斯福对于轴心国的侵略态度, 采取了一些游走在灰色地带的政策对应，如1940年"驱逐舰换基地协议"，开始用有价交换的方式, 及时供给大英帝国各领土极需护航用的"驱逐舰"；

而后来罗斯褔的立场也日趋明显，1940年12月29日的炉边谈话节目中, 已充分表露他将采取的手段；他强调美国应以生产更多的武器成为英国的后盾，并贩售给英国及加拿大，也就是民主兵工厂谈话。

虽然"孤立主义者"批评罗斯福总统的政策, 将会将美国带入战争，但民意风向确实因德国扩张而松动. +
而后租借法案在于参众议院开始审理，在众议院投票通过，**在1941年3月11日生效，**为第1776号案，授权美国总统“售卖、转移、交换、租赁、借出、或交付任何防卫物资，予美国总统认为与"美国国防"有至关重要之国家政府”；法案最初授权总统借出不多于13亿美元的物资。罗斯福总统随即任命小爱德华·斯特蒂纽斯成立租借法案管理办公室。

*在3月法案生效时，可使用国家仅包括"英联邦"，4月"中华民国"开始纳入，10月接受"苏联"能运用此法案采购物资。*

.驱逐舰换基地协议
是美国和英国间的一项交易，发生于1940年9月2日。**在交易中，美国共计50艘老式驱逐舰, 被转交给英国海军，以换取8个"英属北美和西印度群岛殖民地"的"海军港口"和"军用机场"的99年使用权。**

该文件全文共8条，宣布两国不追求领土或其他方面的扩张，不承认法西斯通过侵略造成的领土变更，尊重各国人民选择其政府形式的权利，恢复被暴力剥夺的各国人民的主权，各国在贸易和原料方面享受平等待遇，促成一切国家在经济方面最全面的合作，摧毁纳粹暴政后重建和平，公海航行自由，各国必须放弃武力削减军备，解除侵略国家的武装。*"大西洋宪章"的精神, 后来写入了"联合国宪章"。*


大西洋宪章具体内容如下：

1. 两国不寻求任何领土的或其他方面的扩张；
1. 他们不希望看见任何与人民意志不符合的领土变更；
1. 他们尊重所有民族选择他们愿意生活于其下的政府形式之权利；他们希望看到曾经被武力剥夺其主权及自治权的民族，重新获得主权与自治；
1. 他们要在尊重他们现有的义务下，努力促使所有国家，不分大小，战胜者或战败者，都有机会在同等条件下，为了实现它们经济的繁荣，参加世界贸易和获得世界的原料；
1. 他们希望促成所有国家在经济领域内最充分的合作，以促进所有国家的劳动水平、经济进步和社会保障；
1. **在纳粹暴政被最后消灭之后，**他们希望建立和平，使所有国家能够在它们境内安然自存，并**保障所有地方的所有人在"免于恐惧"和"不虞匮乏"的自由中，**安度他们的一生；
1. 这样的和平, 将使所有人能够在公海上, 不受阻碍地自由地航行；
1. 他们相信为了现实的和精神上的理由，世界上所有国家必须放弃使用武力。如果那些在国境外从事或可能以侵略相威胁的国家, 继续使用陆海空武器装备，则无法维持未来的和平；所以他们相信，**在一个更普遍和更持久的全面安全体系建立之前，必须解除这些国家的武装。**同样，他们会协助和鼓励一切其他可行的措施，来减轻爱好和平的人民在军备上的沉重负担。

=== The Road to Pearl Harbor



Storm clouds were darkening around the world. While Americans struggled to make ends meet during the Great Depression, fascism swept Italy and Germany. Remembering the scars caused by WORLD WAR I, Americans hoped against hope to remain aloof from the increasingly dangerous world.


Americans clung to their time-tested philosophy of isolationism. A series of Neutrality Acts sought to avoid the entrapments that plunged the nation into World War I. Poll after poll showed an unwillingness to become diplomatically involved in international disputes. Isolationist clubs spread across the land.

Yet when Great Britain became the last bastion of freedom standing against a Nazi-controlled Europe, Americans reluctantly began to act. Led by President Roosevelt, the United States used its industrial might to become the arsenal of democracy for the Allied war effort.

In the end, it was Japan who provoked the United States into war. The United States was the only nation standing against Japanese domination of the entire PACIFIC RIM. When economic sanctions against Japan produced a diplomatic stalemate, Japan launched a ruthless surprise attack against American naval bases at Pearl Harbor. Faced with an assault on its own forces, the United States finally entered the Second World War.

'''

==== 1930s Isolationism


"Leave me alone," seemed to be America's attitude toward the rest of the world in the 1930s.

At the dawn of the '30s, foreign policy was not a burning issue for the average American. The stock market had just crashed and each passing month brought greater and greater hardships. American involvement with Europe had brought war in 1917 and unpaid debt throughout the 1920s. Having grown weary with the course of world events, citizens were convinced the most important issues to be tackled were domestic. Foreign policy leaders of the 1930s once again led the country down its well-traveled path of isolationism.

The Hoover Administration set the tone for an isolationist foreign policy with the Hawley-Smoot Tariff. Trade often dominated international relations and the protective wall of the tariff left little to discuss. The Far East became an area of concern when the Japanese government ordered an attack on CHINESE MANCHURIA. This invasion was a clear violation of the NINE POWER TREATY, which prohibited nations from carving a special sphere of influence in China.




The Hoover Administration knew that any harsh action against JAPAN would be unpopular in the midst of the Great Depression. The official American response was the STIMSON DOCTRINE, which refused to recognize any territory illegally occupied by Japan. As meek as this may sound, it went further toward condemning Japan than the government of Great Britain was willing to do.


One possibility for international economic cooperation failed at the LONDON CONFERENCE OF 1933. Leaders of European nations hoped to increase trade and stabilize international currencies. Roosevelt sent a "BOMBSHELL MESSAGE" to the conference refusing any attempt to tie the American dollar to a gold standard. The conference dissolved with European delegates miffed at the lack of cooperation by the United States.

Roosevelt did realize that the Hawley-Smoot Tariff was forestalling American economic recovery. Toward this end, Congress did act to make United States trade policy more flexible. Under the Reciprocal Trade Agreement of 1934, Congress authorized the President to negotiate tariff rates with individual nations. Should a nation agree to reduce its barriers to trade with the United States, the President could reciprocate without the consent of Congress. In addition, FDR broke a 16-year-old diplomatic freeze with the SOVIET UNION by extending formal recognition. Roosevelt hoped to settle some nettlesome outstanding issues with the Soviets, and at the same time stimulate bilateral trade.


The Japanese attack on Chinese Manchuria was in direct violation of the Nine Powers Treaty, which had been passed to prevent nations from establishing a special sphere of influence in China.

Isolationists did not however designate the Western Hemisphere as a dangerous region. On the contrary, as tensions grew in Europe and Asia, a strong sense of PAN-AMERICANISM swept the diplomatic circles. In the face of overseas adversity, strong hemispheric solidarity was attractive. To foster better relations with the nations to the south, Roosevelt declared a bold new GOOD NEIGHBOR POLICY. Marines stationed in Central America and the Caribbean were withdrawn. The (Theodore) ROOSEVELT COROLLARY, which proclaimed the right of the United States to intervene in Latin American affairs was renounced.


The United States would soon been intervening in something much bigger.

==== Reactions to a Troubled World


The day after Franklin Roosevelt took the oath of office the Nazi REICHSTAG gave ADOLF HITLER absolute control of Germany. Hitler had campaigned spewing ANTI-SEMITIC rhetoric and vowing to rebuild a strong Germany.

During the week prior to FDR's inauguration, Japan withdrew from the League of Nations for the condemnation of Japanese aggressions in China. FASCISM and MILITARISM were spreading across Europe and East Asia. Meanwhile Americans were not bracing themselves for the coming war; they were determined to avoid it at all costs.

The first act of European aggression was not committed by Nazi Germany. Fascist DICTATOR BENITO MUSSOLINI ordered the Italian army to invade ETHIOPIA in 1935. The League of Nations refused to act, despite the desperate pleas from Ethiopia's leader HAILE SELASSIE.

The following year Hitler and Mussolini formed the ROME-BERLIN AXIS, an alliance so named because its leaders believed that the line that connected the two capitals would be the axis around which the entire world would revolve. Later in 1936, Hitler marched troops into the Rhineland of Germany, directly breaching the TREATY OF VERSAILLES, which was signed after World War I. A few months later, Fascist GENERAL FRANCISCO FRANCO launched an attempt to overthrow the established LOYALIST government of SPAIN. Franco received generous support from Hitler and Mussolini.



While Fascist aggressors were chalking up victories across Europe, America, Britain, and France sat on the sidelines. The desire to avoid repeating the mistakes of World War I was so strong, no government was willing to confront the dictators. Economic sanctions were unpopular during the height of the Great Depression. The Loyalists in Spain were already receiving aid from the Soviet Union; therefore, public opinion was against assisting Moscow in its "private" war against fascism. As the specter of dictatorship spread across Europe, the West feebly objected with light rebukes and economic penalties with no teeth.

The United States Congress and President Roosevelt passed three important laws — all called NEUTRALITY ACTS — directly aimed at reversing the mistakes made that led to the American entry into the First World War.

The NEUTRALITY ACT OF 1935 prohibited the shipping of arms to nations at war, including the victims of aggressions. This would reduce the possibility of maritime attacks on American vessels. A Senate Committee led by Gerald Nye had conducted extensive research on US activities prior to World War I concluded that trade and international finance had been the leading cause of American entry.

Sinking of the Lusitania
The Neutrality Act of 1936 was designed to keep American citizens out of peril by forbidding them to travel on the ships of warring nations. More than 100 Americans were killed when a German submarine torpedoed the Lusitania in 1915.

The NEUTRALITY ACT OF 1936 renewed the law of the previous year with the additional restrictions — no loans could be made to belligerent nations. Nor were any Americans permitted to travel on the ships of nations at war. There would be no more LUSITANIA incidents.

A NEUTRALITY ACT OF 1937 limited the trade of even non-munitions to belligerent nations to a "CASH AND CARRY BASIS." This meant that the nation in question would have to use its ships to transport goods to avoid American entanglements on the high seas. Isolationists in Congress felt reasonably confident that these measures would keep the United States out of another war.


But as the decade passed, President Roosevelt was growing increasingly skeptical.


'''

==== War Breaks Out


German troops parade through Warsaw in September 1939 following their invasion of Poland. Britain and France responded to this action with declarations of war against Germany. World War II was officially underway.



Reports of the "RAPE OF NANKING," the sacking of the Chinese capital reached the American mainland in the summer of 1937. The brutalities prompted President Roosevelt to abandon cooperation with Congressional isolationists to pursue a more forceful approach against the Japanese.

Neville Chamberlain, Edouard Daladier, Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler
The Munich Pact of 1938 recognized Germany's claim to the Sudetenland and Italy's claim to Ethiopia in exchange for the promise of no further aggressions.



In October 1937, he delivered his famous QUARANTINE SPEECH in Chicago. For the first time, Roosevelt advocated collective action to stop the epidemic aggression. But his hopes of igniting American sensibilities failed.

Emboldened by western inaction, Hitler's troops marched into Austria in 1938 and annexed the country. Then Hitler set his eyes upon the SUDETENLAND, a region in western Czechoslovakia inhabited by 3.5 million Germans. In September the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy met in Munich attempting to diffuse a precarious situation.

Britain and France recognized Hitler's claim to the Sudetenland and Mussolini's conquest of Ethiopia in exchange for the promise of no future aggressions. PRIME MINISTER NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN returned to Great Britain triumphantly proclaiming that he had achieved "peace in our time." It would be one of the most mocked statements of the 20th century.



European appeasement failed six months later, as Hitler mockingly marched his troops into the rest of Czechoslovakia.

In May 1939, Roosevelt urged Congressional leaders to repeal the arms embargo of the earlier Neutrality Acts. Senators from both parties refused the request. Another bombshell crossed the Atlantic on August 24. Adolf Hitler and JOSEF STALIN agreed to put their mutual hatred aside. Germany and the Soviet Union signed a ten-year NONAGGRESSION PACT. Hitler was now free to seize the territory Germany had lost to Poland as a result of the Treaty of Versailles. On September 1, 1939, Nazi troops crossed into Poland from the west.

Finally, on September 3, France and Great Britain declared war on Germany. World War II had begun.


'''

==== The Arsenal of Democracy


War had finally come.

Two days after Britain and France declared war on Nazi Germany, President Roosevelt issued a proclamation of neutrality and ordered the suspension of munitions sales to all belligerents. But Roosevelt stopped short of asking that Americans remain emotionally neutral in the European conflict. FDR knew that the only chance Britain and France would have to defeat the German Reich was to have ample supplies of weaponry. He immediately began to press Congress to repeal the ARMS EMBARGO.

The request was simple. Allow trade of MUNITIONS with belligerent nations on a "cash and carry" basis. There would be no danger to American shipping if the Allies had to carry the supplies on their own ships. Isolationists were concerned, but support for the President's initiative was strong enough. The NEUTRALITY ACT OF 1939 ended the arms embargo and permitted the sales of munitions on a "cash and carry" basis.

Meanwhile, the European war seemed to be more talk than action. Throughout the fall and winter of 1939-40, Stalin moved Soviet troops into sovereign Eastern European states including eastern Poland, but Hitler's WEHRMACHT was silent. Europeans nervously joked of a "phony war" as the winter drew to a close.

Suddenly on April 9, 1940, the German BLITZKRIEG moved rapidly into Denmark and Norway. As the weeks passed, the German war machine steadily advanced through the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and into northern France. Hitler arrived in France to sign the terms of French surrender. The hapless French were forced to submit to the Germans in the very same railroad car the Germans surrendered twenty-two years previously at the end of World War I. Britain was the only democracy in Europe in open opposition to Germany.





New PRIME MINISTER WINSTON CHURCHILL desperately pleaded with Roosevelt for assistance. In the summer of 1940, Hitler launched OPERATION SEA LION, an all-out assault on the British mainland. The ROYAL AIR FORCE of Britain battled the German Luftwaffe in the greatest air battle in history as Americans watched nervously.

Slowly but surely American public opinion shifted toward helping the British. The COMMITTEE TO DEFEND AMERICA BY AIDING THE ALLIES launched a propaganda campaign to mobilize the American public. Groups like the AMERICA FIRST COMMITTEE, which contained prominent Americans such as CHARLES LINDBERGH, insisted a hemispheric defense was the wisest choice for the United States to follow. A great debate was on.

Miraculously Britain held its own with Germany while America deliberated. In September 1940, the United States agreed to the transfer of 50 old destroyers to the British fleet in exchange for naval bases in the Western Hemisphere. By directly aiding the ALLIES, America could no longer hide behind the shield of neutrality. At Roosevelt's urging, Congress authorized the construction of new planes to defend America's coast. Congress also enacted the first peacetime draft in the nation's history in September 1940. The interventionist argument seemed to be prevailing, but debate continued into 1941.

Senator Robert Taft

Congress eventually approved the Lend-Lease Act, but not without a great deal of debate. Senator Robert Taft argued that the Act allowed the U.S. "to carry on a kind of undeclared war."

The DESTROYER DEAL was helpful, but Britain simply did not have the financial reserves to pay for all the weapons they needed. Roosevelt feared another postwar debt crisis so he hatched a new plan called Lend-Lease. Roosevelt publicly mused that if a neighbor's house is on fire, nobody sells him a hose to put it out. Common sense dictated that the hose is lent to the neighbor and returned when the fire is extinguished. The United States could simply lend Great Britain the materials it would need to fight the war. When the war was over, they would be returned. The Congress hotly argued over the proposal. SENATOR ROBERT TAFT retorted: "Lending war equipment is a good deal like lending chewing gum. You don't want it back."

In March 1941 after a great deal of controversy, Congress approved the LEND-LEASE ACT, which eventually appropriated $50 billion of aid to the Allies. Meanwhile Roosevelt began an unprecedented third term.



Neutrality was no longer a façade behind which America could hide. Hitler saw Lend-Lease as tantamount to a war declaration and ordered attacks on American ships.

Roosevelt urged Congress and Americans to take action. In his famous FOUR FREEDOM SPEECH he enumerates what the rights of any citizen of the world are and why it is important for America to lead the way:

The first is freedom of speech and expression — everywhere in the world. The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way — everywhere in the world. The third is freedom from want, which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants — everywhere in the world. The fourth is freedom from fear, which, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor — anywhere in the world.



Congress still vacillated. Roosevelt met with Churchill in the summer of 1941 and agreed to the ATLANTIC CHARTER, a statement that outlined Anglo-American war aims. At this point, the United States was willing to commit almost everything to the Allied war machine — money, resources, and diplomacy.


The only thing missing was American troops.

====  Pearl Harbor



While the international picture in Europe was growing increasingly dimmer for the United States, relations with Japan were souring as well. Japan's aggression was literally being fueled by the United States. The Japanese military machine relied heavily on imports of American steel and oil to prosecute its assault on China and French Indochina.

Placing a strict embargo on Japan would have seemed obvious, but Roosevelt feared that Japan would strike at the resource-laden Dutch East Indies to make up the difference. Beginning in late-1940, the United States grew less patient with Japanese atrocities and began to restrict trade with the Empire.

Just prior to Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union, Japan signed a nonaggression pact with Stalin. This removed the threat of a Russian attack on Japan's new holdings. With Europe busy fighting Hitler, the United States remained the only obstacle to the establishment of a huge Japanese empire spanning East Asia.

By the end of 1940, the United States had ended shipments of scrap metal, steel, and iron ore to Japan. Simultaneously, the United States began to send military hardware to CHIANG KAI-SHEK, the nominal leader of the Chinese forces resisting Japanese takeover.



Negotiations between Japan and the U.S. began in early 1941, but there was little movement. By midsummer, FDR made the fateful step of freezing all Japanese assets in the United States and ending shipments of oil to the island nation. Negotiations went nowhere. The United States was as unwilling to accept Japanese expansion and Japan was unwilling to end its conquests.

American diplomats did, however, have a hidden advantage. With the help of "MAGIC," a decoding device, the United States was able to decipher Japan's radio transmissions. Leaders in Washington knew that the deadline for diplomacy set by Japan's high command was November 25. When that date came and passed, American officials were poised for a strike. The prevailing view was that the attack would focus on British Malaya or the Dutch East Indies to replenish dwindling fuel supplies.

Unbeknown to the United States, a Japanese fleet of aircraft carriers stealthily steamed toward Hawaii.

The goals for the Japanese attack were simple. Japan did not hope to conquer the United States or even to force the abandonment of Hawaii with the attack on Pearl Harbor. The United States was too much of a threat to their newly acquired territories. With holdings in the Philippines, Guam, American Samoa, and other small islands, Japan was vulnerable to an American naval attack. A swift first strike against the bulk of the UNITED STATES PACIFIC FLEET would seriously cripple the American ability to respond. The hopes were that Japan could capture the PHILIPPINES and American island holdings before the American navy could recuperate and retaliate. An impenetrable fortress would then stretch across the entire Pacific Rim. The United States, distracted by European events, would be forced to recognize the new order in East Asia.



All these assumptions were wrong. As the bombs rained on PEARL HARBOR on the infamous morning of Sunday, December 7, 1941, almost 3,000 Americans were killed. Six battleships were destroyed or rendered unseaworthy, and most of the ground planes were ravaged as well. Americans reacted with surprise and anger.

When President Roosevelt addressed the Congress the next day and asked for a declaration of war, there was only one dissenting vote in either house of Congress. Despite two decades of regret over World War I and ostrichlike isolationism, the American people plunged headfirst into a destructive conflict.
