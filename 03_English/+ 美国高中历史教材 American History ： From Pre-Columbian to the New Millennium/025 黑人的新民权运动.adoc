== 解说

=== A New Civil Rights Movement 新民权运动


In 1950, the United States operated under _an apartheid (n.)（南非政府过去推行的）种族隔离制度；分离，隔离-like system_ of legislated (v.)制定法律；立法 white supremacy 霸权，至高无上；优势.

[.my2]
1950年，美国在类似"种族隔离"的"白人至上"立法制度下运作。

Although the Civil War did *bring* an official end *to* slavery in the United States, it did not erase (v.)清除；消除；消灭 the social barriers 后定 built (v.) by that "PECULIAR 奇怪的，不寻常的；特别的，独特的；不舒服的 INSTITUTION （由来已久的）风俗习惯，制度."

[.my2]
尽管内战确实正式结束了美国的奴隶制，但它并没有消除该“特殊制度”所建立的社会障碍。

Despite the efforts of _RADICAL 激进的，极端的 RECONSTRUCTIONISTS_ 重建主义者, the American South emerged (v.) from the CIVIL WAR /with a system of laws that undermined (v.)从根基处破坏；挖…的墙脚;逐渐削弱（信心、权威等）；使逐步减少效力 the freedom of African Americans /and preserved (v.) many elements of white privilege 特权. +
No _major successful attack_ was launched on the segregation （对不同种族、宗教或性别的人所采取的）隔离并区别对待，隔离政策 system until the 1950s.

[.my2]
尽管激进的重建主义者做出了努力，但美国南方在内战结束后，出现了一套法律体系，削弱了非裔美国人的自由，并保留了许多白人特权的要素。直到 20 世纪 50 年代，才对种族隔离制度发起了重大成功的攻击。



Beginning with the Supreme Court's _school integration 结合；整合；一体化;（不同肤色、种族、宗教信仰等的人的）混合，融合 ruling_ （尤指法庭的）裁决，裁定 of 1954, the American legal system `谓` seemed sympathetic (a.)同情的 to African American demands (n.) that their FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT 第十四修正案 CIVIL RIGHTS 公民权利 be protected. ++

Soon, a peaceful _equality 平等；均等；相等 movement_ `谓` began under the unofficial leadership of _Dr. Martin Luther King Jr_. +
A wave of marches, boycotts 抵制, sit-ins 静坐抗议；静坐罢工, and freedom rides 自由乘车者  `谓` swept (v.) the American South and even parts of the North.

[.my2]
从 1954 年最高法院的"学校融合"裁决开始，美国法律体系似乎同情非裔美国人要求保护他们的第十四条修正案公民权利。很快，在"马丁·路德·金"博士的非正式领导下，一场和平的平等运动开始了。游行、抵制、静坐和自由骑行的浪潮, 席卷了美国南部甚至北部部分地区。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Freedom Riders
自由乘车者, 是指美国的民权活动家们从1961年开始的, 乘坐跨州巴士前往种族隔离现象严重的美国南部，以检验美国最高法院针对波因顿诉弗吉尼亚案（Boynton v. Virginia）（1960）和 艾琳·摩尔根诉弗吉尼亚州案（Irene Morgan v. Commonwealth of Virginia）（1946）判决的落实情况。
====


Public opinion polls 民意调查 across the nation and the world `谓` revealed *a great deal 大量；很多 of* sympathy for African Americans. +
The Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson administrations gave the Civil Rights Movement at least tacit (a.)心照不宣的，不言而喻的，默示的 support. +
Although many obstacles to _complete (a.)完全的，彻底的；全部的 racial equity_ `谓` remained, by 1965 most legal forms of discrimination 歧视，区别对待 had been abolished.

[.my2]
全国和世界各地的民意调查显示，人们对非裔美国人抱有极大的同情。艾森豪威尔、肯尼迪和约翰逊政府, 至少给予了民权运动默许的支持。*尽管"实现种族平等"的障碍仍然存在，但到 1965 年，大多数合法形式的歧视已经被废除。*


Legal equality did not bring economic equality and social acceptance. +
Gains made by civil rights activists did not bring greater unity in the movement. +
On the contrary 相反地, as the 1960s progressed (v.)进步，发展, a radical wing of the movement grew (v.) stronger and stronger. +

Influenced by Malcolm X 美国一位黑人领袖, the Black Power Movement rejected (v.)拒绝接受；不予考虑 _the policy of nonviolence_ at all costs /and even believed integration was not a desirable 令人向往的，值得拥有的；可取的；性感的 short-term goal. +
Black nationalists 民族主义者 *called for* the establishment of a nation 国家；民族 of African Americans 后定 *dependent (a.)依靠的；依赖的 on* each other for support /without the interference  干涉，干预 or help (n.) of whites.

[.my2]
法律平等并没有带来经济平等和社会接受。民权活动人士取得的成果. +
并没有给运动带来更大的团结。相反，**随着 20 世纪 60 年代的进展，运动中的"激进派"变得越来越强大。**受马尔科姆·艾克斯的影响，*黑人权力运动, 不惜一切代价拒绝"非暴力"政策，甚至认为"融合"并不是一个理想的短期目标。黑人民族主义者呼吁建立一个非裔美国人相互依赖、相互支持、不受白人干涉或帮助的国家。*

Race-related violence began to spread across the country. +
Beginning in 1964, a series of "long, hot summers" of rioting 暴乱 `谓` plagued (v.)给…造成长时间的痛苦（或麻烦）；困扰；折磨；使受煎熬 urban centers. +

More and more individuals 后定 *dedicated (v.)致力于，献身于 to* African American causes （支持或为之奋斗的）事业，目标，思想 `谓` became victims of assassination 暗杀，行刺. +
Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King Jr. `系` were a few of the more famous casualties 伤亡人员；受害者 of the tempest 暴风雨；骚动；动乱.

[.my2]
与种族有关的暴力, 开始在全国蔓延。从 1964 年开始，一系列“漫长而炎热的夏天”的骚乱, 困扰着城市中心。越来越多致力于"非裔美国人"事业的个人, 成为暗杀的受害者。梅德加·埃弗斯（Medgar Evers）、马尔科姆·艾克斯（Malcolm X）和小马丁·路德·金（Martin Luther King Jr.）, 是这场风暴中较为著名的遇难者。

Hope and optimism 乐观；乐观主义 *gave way to* 让位给，让步给 alienation
疏离感；失去支持，疏远 and despair /as the 1970s began. +
Many realized that although `主` changing (v.) racist laws `系` was actually relatively simple, changing (v.) racist attitudes was a much more difficult task.

[.my2]
*20 世纪 70 年代开始，"希望"和"乐观主义", 被"疏远"和"绝望"所取代。许多人意识到，虽然改"变种族主义的法律"实际上相对简单，但"改变种族主义的态度", 却是一项艰巨的任务。*

====  Separate (v.) No Longer? 不再分开？



Jim Crow 黑人（贬义词） laws existed in several southern states and served (v.) to reinforce (v.)加强；充实；使更强烈 the white authority 权力；威权；当权（地位） that had been lost (v.) following Reconstruction （美国历史）重建时期. +
One such law required (v.) blacks and whites to drink (v.) from separate _water fountains_ (人工喷泉；喷水池) 饮水机.

吉姆·克劳法是 19 世纪末和 20 世纪初在美国南部引入的州和地方法律，强制执行种族隔离，“吉姆·克劳”是对非裔美国人的贬义词。 此类法律一直有效到 1965 年。

.pe·jora·tive

During the first half of the 20th century, the United States existed as two nations in one.

[.my2]
20世纪上半叶，美国作为两个国家合而为一。

The Supreme Court ruling in PLESSY V. FERGUSON (1896) decreed (v.)裁定；判决；颁布 that `主` #the legislation# 法规，法律 of two separate societies — one black and one white — `谓` *#was permitted#* (v.)允许；准许 /as long as `主` the two `系` were equal.

Across the land, blacks and whites dined (v.)用餐，吃饭 at separate restaurants, bathed (v.) in separate swimming pools, and drank (v.) from separate water fountains.

[.my2]
南北各州通过了法律，为每个种族建立学校和公共设施。这些被称为"吉姆·克劳法"的法规, 在重建时期削弱了白人权威后又重新建立了它。在这片土地上，黑人和白人在不同的餐厅用餐，在不同的游泳池洗澡，从不同的喷泉喝水。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Jim Crow laws 吉姆·克劳法
是1876年至1965年间, 美国南部各州以及边境各州对有色人种（主要针对非洲裔美国人，但同时也包含其他族群）实行"种族隔离制度"的法律。

这些法律上的种族隔离, **强制公共设施必须依照种族的不同, 而隔离使用，**且在"隔离但平等"的原则下，"种族隔离"被解释为不违反宪法保障的同等保护权，因此得以持续存在。*但事实上, 黑人所能享有的部分与白人相较往往是较差的，而这样的差别待遇, 也造成了黑人长久以来处于经济、教育及社会上较为弱势的地位。*

1865年至1876年的"重建时期"，联邦法律为南方的自由黑人, 提供一定程度的民权保护。重建时期结束后，南方各州政府、立法机构, 及法院, 重新被南方白人所掌控，一系列"吉姆·克劳法"被通过，扩大用来隔离其他非白人种族。

1945年后，非裔美国人民权运动兴起，民权团体用联邦法律来抵抗吉姆·克劳法。例如著名的“布朗诉托皮卡教育局案”（1954年），由第14任美国首席大法官厄尔·沃伦领导的美国最高法院通过判决，九位大法官一致同意终止了公立学校中的种族隔离。

而后，沃伦法院进一步在不同案件中, 逐步废除了吉姆·克劳法，主要包括"亚特兰大之心汽车旅馆诉美国案"（1965年）。

而**美国国会也在1964年通过《1964年民权法案》及《1965年投票权法案》，禁止法律上有任何形式的种族隔离和歧视政策，"吉姆·克劳法"在法律层面上正式走入历史。**

[.my2]
第一个主战场是在学校。到本世纪中叶，很明显，南方各州已经巧妙地制定了独立的教育制度。然而，这些学校从来都不平等。由律师瑟古德·马歇尔领导的全国有色人种协进会（NAACP）, 起诉了南方各地的公立学校，坚称其违反了“隔离但平等”条款。

[.my2]
在任何一个存在不同种族教育法的州，公共支出都是平等的。白人学校的教师工资更高，白人学生的校舍得到更精心的维护，教材资金更自由地流入白人学校。各州在白人学生教育上的支出通常是非裔美国学生教育支出的 10 到 20 倍。


The Supreme Court finally decided *to rule (v.)决定；裁定；判决 on* this subject in 1954 in the landmark (n.)（标志重要阶段的）里程碑 BROWN V. _BOARD OF EDUCATION_ OF TOPEKA 城市名 case.

判决一致反对种族隔离。 “独立的设施本质上是不平等的，”首席大法官厄尔·沃伦 (EARL WARREN) 的观点如下。沃伦不知疲倦地努力取得了9-0的裁决。他担心, 任何异议都可能为反对融合的势力提供法律依据。联合的最高法院发出了明确的信息：学校必须整合。

Brown v. _Board of Education_ of Topeka +
May 17, 1954, saw the Supreme Court — in the case of Brown v. _Board of Education_ of Topeka — rule (v.) that `主` segregation of public schools `系` was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, which states (v.) that all citizens deserve (v.) equal protection under the law.

[.my2]
1954 年 5 月 17 日，最高法院在"布朗诉托皮卡教育委员会案"中, 裁定公立学校的种族隔离, 违反了第十四修正案，该修正案规定, 所有公民都应受到法律的平等保护。

布朗大学毕业十年后，只有不到百分之十的南方公立学校, 实现了一体化。一些地区的达标率为零。该裁决没有涉及单独的卫生间、公交车座位, 或酒店房间，因此吉姆·克劳法保持不变。但迈向平等社会的第一步是谨慎的。

It would take _a decade 十年，十年期 of protest 抗议，反对, legislation, and bloodshed_ before America neared (v.) a truer equality.

[.my2]
*美国花了十年的抗议、立法和流血, 才接近真正的平等。*

[.my2]
**1959 年，国会通过了《民权法案》，这是重建以来的第一项此类措施。该法律设立了一个常设"民权委员会"来协助黑人选举权。这项措施效果不大，而且被证明是无效的，但它为未来几年更强有力的立法铺平了道路。**

On February 1, 1960, a new tactic 策略；手段；招数 was added to the peaceful activists' strategy. +
Four African American college students *walked up to* 走向，走近 a whites-only _lunch counter_ 午餐柜台 at the local WOOLWORTH'S store in Greensboro, North Carolina, and *asked for* coffee. +
When service was refused, the students sat patiently. +
Despite threats and intimidation 恫吓，威胁, the students sat quietly and waited to be served.

[.my2]
没有人不带着严肃的目的参加这种静坐。*指示很简单：安静地坐着等待服务。参与者常常会受到当地客户的嘲笑和威胁。有时他们会被扔食物或番茄酱。愤怒的旁观者试图挑起打斗，但打斗从未发生过。如果发生身体攻击，学生会在地板上蜷缩成球并接受惩罚。任何暴力报复都会破坏静坐的精神。当当地警察来逮捕示威者时，另一排学生就会占据空出的座位。*

作为 20 世纪 60 年代和平民权运动无可争议的领袖，DR.马丁路德金。他同时是他那个时代最受爱戴的人之一，也是最令人憎恨的人之一。从 1955 年参与蒙哥马利公交车抵制运动, 到 1968 年英年早逝，金通过和平方式传达的变革信息, 增加了该运动的人数，并赋予其道德力量。马丁·路德·金的遗产, 体现在这两个简单的词中："平等"和"非暴力"。

King was raised in an activist (a.)积极分子的 family. +
His father was deeply influenced by MARCUS GARVEY's BACK TO AFRICA MOVEMENT in the 1920s. +
His mother was the daughter of one of Atlanta's most influential African American ministers 牧师;（英国及其他许多国家的）部长，大臣.

[.my2]
金在一个积极分子家庭中长大。他的父亲深受 20 年代马库斯·加维 (MARCUS GARVEY) 的“重返非洲运动”的影响。他的母亲是亚特兰大最有影响力的非裔美国牧师之一的女儿。



After his organization of the bus boycott, King formed (v.) the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which *dedicated (v.)致力于，献身于 itself to* the advancement of rights for African Americans. +
In April 1963, King organized a protest 抗议，反对；抗议活动 in Birmingham, Alabama, a city King called "the most thoroughly 完全地，极度地；彻底地 segregated city in the United States." Since the end of World War II, there had been 60 unsolved bombings of African American churches and homes.

[.my2]
在组织公交车抵制活动后，金成立了南方基督教领袖会议，致力于促进非裔美国人的权利。 1963年4月，金在阿拉巴马州伯明翰组织了一场抗议活动，金称这座城市为“美国种族隔离最彻底的城市”。自二战结束以来，已有 60 起针对非裔美国人教堂和住宅的爆炸事件尚未解决。

Boycotts, sit-ins and marches `谓` were conducted 组织；安排；实施；执行. +

Later in 1963, he *delivered* 发表，宣布 his famous "I Have a Dream" speech *to* thousands in Washington, D.C.

[.my2]
抵制、静坐和游行都在进行。当伯明翰警察局局长布尔·康纳（Bull Connor）对示威者使用消防水龙带和警犬时，数百万人在电视上看到了这些画面。金被捕。但全国和世界各地都对金和他的家人表示支持。 1963 年晚些时候，他在华盛顿特区向数千人发表了著名的“我有一个梦想”演讲。

[.my2]
1964 年《民权法案》通过后，金将工作重点转向南方非裔美国选民登记。 1965年，他在阿拉巴马州塞尔玛领导了一场游行，以提高阿拉巴马州非裔美国选民的比例。金再次被捕。游行者再次遭到警察的袭击。催泪瓦斯、牛棒和警棍落在和平示威者身上。公众舆论主要站在金和抗议者一边。最后，约翰逊总统命令国民警卫队保护示威者免受袭击，金才得以完成从塞尔玛到州首府蒙哥马利的长征。塞尔玛的行动导致 1965 年投票权法案的通过。

但世界从未忘记他的贡献。 1963年，《时代》杂志将他评为“年度人物”。1964年，**他获得了诺贝尔和平奖，并被描述为“西方世界第一个向我们表明, 可以在不使用暴力的情况下, 进行斗争的人”。 **1977年，*他被追授"总统自由勋章"，这是美国平民可以获得的最高奖项。* 20 世纪 80 年代，他的生日成为全国性节日，为美国人创造了一年一度的机会, 来反思他一生致力于推进的两种价值观：平等和非暴力。

在约翰逊任内，向贫穷宣战政策, 及经济的发展, 使数百万美国人脱离了贫困阶层。

约翰逊同时签署了一系列民权法案，禁止在公共设施、跨州贸易、工作场所及住房领域进行种族歧视，《选举权法案》则取缔了南方一些州对非裔美国人选举权进行的限制。 +
《1965年移民及国籍法案》则改革了美国的移民体系，以种族为尺度的移民配额制度终结，以国籍为尺度的制度开始实施。

在约翰逊任内，美国在越南战争中的参与程度逐渐升级。美军损失数额亦大幅上升，和平进程逐渐陷入僵局，对于战事的不满情绪导致大规模反战运动, 在美国大学校园及海外地区集中爆发。 +
约翰逊上任初期广受民众欢迎，但越南战争及国内社会不稳定, 导致其支持率逐渐下跌。

1968年约翰逊在新罕布什尔州民主党总统初选中惨败，由此亦宣布放弃竞选连任。共和党候选人"理查德·尼克松"在大选中胜出.

史学家称新政时期后的美国现代自由主义在约翰逊任内达到了顶峰。由于其在国内政绩优异，推动立法对民权、枪支管制、原野保护及社会保险等有重大影响，尽管他对外在越战上受挫，许多史学家对其评价仍旧颇为积极，在美国总统排名中依旧较为靠前.

===  A New Civil Rights Movement


In 1950, the United States operated under an apartheid-like system of legislated white supremacy.

Although the Civil War did bring an official end to slavery in the United States, it did not erase the social barriers built by that "PECULIAR INSTITUTION."

Despite the efforts of RADICAL RECONSTRUCTIONISTS, the American South emerged from the CIVIL WAR with a system of laws that undermined the freedom of African Americans and preserved many elements of white privilege. No major successful attack was launched on the segregation system until the 1950s.



Beginning with the Supreme Court's school integration ruling of 1954, the American legal system seemed sympathetic to African American demands that their FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT CIVIL RIGHTS be protected. Soon, a peaceful equality movement began under the unofficial leadership of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. A wave of marches, boycotts, sit-ins, and freedom rides swept the American South and even parts of the North.

Public opinion polls across the nation and the world revealed a great deal of sympathy for African Americans. The Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson administrations gave the Civil Rights Movement at least tacit support. Although many obstacles to complete racial equity remained, by 1965 most legal forms of discrimination had been abolished.


Legal equality did not bring economic equality and social acceptance. Gains made by civil rights activists did not bring greater unity in the movement. On the contrary, as the 1960s progressed, a radical wing of the movement grew stronger and stronger. Influenced by Malcolm X, the Black Power Movement rejected the policy of nonviolence at all costs and even believed integration was not a desirable short-term goal. Black nationalists called for the establishment of a nation of African Americans dependent on each other for support without the interference or help of whites.

Race-related violence began to spread across the country. Beginning in 1964, a series of "long, hot summers" of rioting plagued urban centers. More and more individuals dedicated to African American causes became victims of assassination. Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King Jr. were a few of the more famous casualties of the tempest.

Hope and optimism gave way to alienation and despair as the 1970s began. Many realized that although changing racist laws was actually relatively simple, changing racist attitudes was a much more difficult task.

====  Separate No Longer?



Jim Crow laws existed in several southern states and served to reinforce the white authority that had been lost following Reconstruction. One such law required blacks and whites to drink from separate water fountains.

During the first half of the 20th century, the United States existed as two nations in one.

The Supreme Court ruling in PLESSY V. FERGUSON (1896) decreed that the legislation of two separate societies — one black and one white — was permitted as long as the two were equal.

States across the North and South passed laws creating schools and public facilities for each race. These regulations, known as Jim Crow laws, reestablished white authority after it had diminished during the Reconstruction era. Across the land, blacks and whites dined at separate restaurants, bathed in separate swimming pools, and drank from separate water fountains.


The United States had established an American brand of apartheid.

In the aftermath of World War II, America sought to demonstrate to the world the merit of free democracies over communist dictatorships. But its segregation system exposed fundamental hypocrisy. Change began brewing in the late 1940s. President Harry Truman ordered the end of segregation in the armed services, But the wall built by JIM CROW legislation seemed insurmountable.

The first major battleground was in the schools. It was very clear by mid-century that southern states had expertly enacted separate educational systems. These schools, however, were never equal. The NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE (NAACP), led by attorney THURGOOD MARSHALL, sued public schools across the South, insisting that the "SEPARATE BUT EQUAL" CLAUSE had been violated.


In no state where distinct racial education laws existed was there equality in public spending. Teachers in white schools were paid better wages, school buildings for white students were maintained more carefully, and funds for educational materials flowed more liberally into white schools. States normally spent 10 to 20 times on the education of white students as they spent on African American students.

The Supreme Court finally decided to rule on this subject in 1954 in the landmark BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION OF TOPEKA case.

The verdict was unanimous against segregation. "Separate facilities are inherently unequal," read Chief Justice EARL WARREN's opinion. Warren worked tirelessly to achieve a 9-0 ruling. He feared any dissent might provide a legal argument for the forces against integration. The united Supreme Court sent a clear message: schools had to integrate.

Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka
May 17, 1954, saw the Supreme Court — in the case of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka — rule that segregation of public schools was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, which states that all citizens deserve equal protection under the law.

The North and the border states quickly complied with the ruling, but the Brown decision fell on deaf ears in the South. The Court had stopped short of insisting on immediate integration, instead asking local governments to proceed "with all deliberate speed" in complying.

Ten years after Brown, fewer than ten percent of Southern public schools had integrated. Some areas achieved a zero percent compliance rate. The ruling did not address separate restrooms, bus seats, or hotel rooms, so Jim Crow laws remained intact. But cautious first steps toward an equal society had been taken.

It would take a decade of protest, legislation, and bloodshed before America neared a truer equality.


In 1959, Congress passed the CIVIL RIGHTS ACT, the first such measure since Reconstruction. The law created a permanent civil rights commission to assist black suffrage. The measure had little teeth and proved ineffective, but it paved the way for more powerful legislation in the years to come.

==== The Sit-In Movement


By 1960, the Civil Rights Movement had gained strong momentum. The nonviolent measures employed by Martin Luther King Jr. helped African American activists win supporters across the country and throughout the world.

On February 1, 1960, a new tactic was added to the peaceful activists' strategy. Four African American college students walked up to a whites-only lunch counter at the local WOOLWORTH'S store in Greensboro, North Carolina, and asked for coffee. When service was refused, the students sat patiently. Despite threats and intimidation, the students sat quietly and waited to be served.

The civil rights sit-in was born.

No one participated in a sit-in of this sort without seriousness of purpose. The instructions were simple: sit quietly and wait to be served. Often the participants would be jeered and threatened by local customers. Sometimes they would be pelted with food or ketchup. Angry onlookers tried to provoke fights that never came. In the event of a physical attack, the student would curl up into a ball on the floor and take the punishment. Any violent reprisal would undermine the spirit of the sit-in. When the local police came to arrest the demonstrators, another line of students would take the vacated seats.




SIT-IN organizers believed that if the violence were only on the part of the white community, the world would see the righteousness of their cause. Before the end of the school year, over 1500 black demonstrators were arrested. But their sacrifice brought results. Slowly, but surely, restaurants throughout the South began to abandon their policies of segregation.

In April 1960, Martin Luther King Jr. sponsored a conference to discuss strategy. Students from the North and the South came together and formed the STUDENT NONVIOLENT COORDINATING COMMITTEE (SNCC). Early leaders included STOKELY CARMICHAEL and FANNIE LOU HAMER. The CONGRESS ON RACIAL EQUALITY (CORE) was a northern group of students led by JAMES FARMER, which also endorsed direct action. These groups became the grassroots organizers of future sit-ins at lunch counters, wade-ins at segregated swimming pools, and pray-ins at white-only churches.


New ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERT KENNEDY ordered federal marshals to protect future freedom rides. Bowing to political and public pressure, the INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION soon banned segregation on interstate travel. Progress was slow indeed, but the wall between the races was gradually being eroded.

==== Gains and Pains


Civil rights activists in the early 1960s teemed with enthusiasm. The courts and the federal government seemed to be on their side, and the movement was winning the battle for public opinion.

As sit-ins and freedom rides spread across the South, African American leaders set a new, ambitious goal: a federal law banning racial discrimination in all public accommodations and in employment. In the summer of 1963, President Kennedy indicated he would support such a measure, and thousands marched on Washington to support the bill.

Blacks and whites sang "WE SHALL OVERCOME" and listened to Martin Luther King Jr. deliver his "I HAVE A DREAM" speech. The Civil Rights Movement seemed on the brink of triumph.

As equality advocates notched more and more successes, the forces against change grew more active as well. Groups such the Ku Klux Klan increased hate crimes.



16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, served as a meeting place for many participants of the civil rights movement. Tragedy struck the church in 1963 when a bomb exploded there, killing four young girls and injuring 22 others.

NAACP leader Medgar Evers was murdered in cold blood that summer in Mississippi as he tried to enter his home.



Many who had looked to JOHN F. KENNEDY as a sympathetic leader were crushed when he fell victim to assassination in November 1963. But Kennedy's death did not derail the Civil Rights Act.

PRESIDENT LYNDON JOHNSON signed the bill into law in July 1964. As of that day, it became illegal to refuse employment to an individual on the basis of race. Segregation at any public facility in America was now against the law.



The passage of that act led to a new focus. Many African Americans had been robbed of the right to vote since southern states enacted discriminatory poll taxes and literacy tests. Only five percent of African Americans eligible to vote were registered in Mississippi in 1965. The 24TH AMENDMENT banned the POLL TAX in 1964. A new landmark law, the VOTING RIGHTS ACT of 1965, banned the literacy test and other such measures designed to keep blacks from voting. It also placed federal registrars in the South to ensure black suffrage. By 1965, few legal barriers to racial equality remained.

But centuries of racism could not be erased with the pen. Many African Americans continued to languish in the bottom economic strata. Civil rights activists fought on to achieve economic as well as legal equality. It is a fight that continues to this day.

In the words of Martin Luther King Jr.:

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal."

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood.

I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a desert state, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, a state sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today.

==== Martin Luther King Jr.


As the unquestioned leader of the peaceful Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. was at the same time one of the most beloved and one of the most hated men of his time. From his involvement in the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955 until his untimely death in 1968, King's message of change through peaceful means added to the movement's numbers and gave it its moral strength. The legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. is embodied in these two simple words: equality and nonviolence.

King was raised in an activist family. His father was deeply influenced by MARCUS GARVEY's BACK TO AFRICA MOVEMENT in the 1920s. His mother was the daughter of one of Atlanta's most influential African American ministers.



After his organization of the bus boycott, King formed the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which dedicated itself to the advancement of rights for African Americans. In April 1963, King organized a protest in Birmingham, Alabama, a city King called "the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States." Since the end of World War II, there had been 60 unsolved bombings of African American churches and homes.

Boycotts, sit-ins and marches were conducted. When Bull Connor, head of the Birmingham police department, used fire hoses and dogs on the demonstrators, millions saw the images on television. King was arrested. But support came from around the nation and the world for King and his family. Later in 1963, he delivered his famous "I Have a Dream" speech to thousands in Washington, D.C.

Selma to Montgomery

In March 1965, Dr. King led protestors on a 50-mile, voting-rights march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. It took three attempts for the protestors to complete the march, battling tear gas, cattle prods, and police batons, but the national attention drawn by their efforts ultimately led to the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

After the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, King turned his efforts to registering African American voters in the South. In 1965, he led a march in Selma, Alabama, to increase the percentage of African American voters in Alabama. Again, King was arrested. Again, the marchers faced attacks by the police. Tear gas, cattle prods, and billy clubs fell on the peaceful demonstrators. Public opinion weighed predominantly on the side of King and the protesters. Finally, President Johnson ordered the National Guard to protect the demonstrators from attack, and King was able to complete the long march from Selma to the state capital of Montgomery. The action in Selma led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Early in the morning of April 4, 1968, King was shot by JAMES EARL RAY. Spontaneous violence spread through urban areas as mourners unleashed their rage at the loss of their leader. Rioting burst forth in many American cities.

But the world never forgot his contributions. Time magazine had named him "Man of the Year" in 1963. In 1964, he won the Nobel Peace Prize and was described as "the first person in the Western world to have shown us that a struggle can be waged without violence." In 1977, he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest award a civilian American can earn. In the 1980s, his birthday became a national holiday, creating an annual opportunity for Americans to reflect on the two values he dedicated his life to advancing: equality and nonviolence.

==== Black Power

Despite legislative gains against discriminatory policies, America was moving toward two distinct societies divided along racial lines.

As the great migration of blacks from the South to northern cities continued, white northerners began deserting the cities for the suburbs.

African Americans had been victimized by poor education, the unavailability of quality employment, slum conditions, and police brutality. The average income of a black household was only slightly more than half the income of its white counterpart. The Kerner Commission recommended a wide array of social spending programs, including housing programs, job training, and welfare. Civil rights legislation became the cornerstone of Lyndon Johnson's GREAT SOCIETY PROGRAM.


As Martin Luther King preached his gospel of peaceful change and integration in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Malcolm X delivered a different message: whites were not to be trusted. He called on African Americans to be proud of their heritage and to set up strong communities without the help of white Americans. He promoted the establishment of a separate state for African Americans in which they could rely on themselves to provide solutions to their own problems. Violence was not the only answer, but violence was justified in self-defense. Blacks should achieve what was rightfully theirs "by any means necessary."

As Malcolm X led a mass rally in Harlem on February 21, 1965, rival Black Muslims gunned him down.

Although his life was ended, the ideas he preached lived on in the Black Power Movement.



Carmichael and McKissick were heavily influenced by the words of Malcolm X, and rejected integration as a short-term goal. Carmichael felt that blacks needed to feel a sense of racial pride and self-respect before any meaningful gains could be achieved. He encouraged the strengthening of African American communities without the help of whites.



Chapters of SNCC and CORE — both integrated organizations — began to reject white membership as Carmichael abandoned peaceful resistance. Martin Luther King Jr. and the NAACP denounced black power as the proper forward path. But black power was a powerful message in the streets of urban America, where resentment boiled and tempers flared.

Soon, African American students began to celebrate African American culture boldly and publicly. Colleges teemed with young blacks wearing traditional African colors and clothes. Soul singer JAMES BROWN had his audience chanting "Say it loud, I'm black and I'm proud." Hairstyles unique to African Americans became popular and youths proclaimed, "BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL!"

That same year, HUEY NEWTON AND BOBBY SEALE took Carmichael's advice one step further. They formed the BLACK PANTHER PARTY in Oakland, California. Openly brandishing weapons, the Panthers decided to take control of their own neighborhoods to aid their communities and to resist police brutality. Soon the Panthers spread across the nation. The Black Panther Party borrowed many tenets from socialist movements, including Mao Zedong's famous creed "Political power comes through the barrel of a gun." The Panthers and the police exchanged gunshots on American streets as white Americans viewed the growing militancy with increasing alarm.



The peaceful Civil Rights Movement was dealt a severe blow in the spring of 1968. On the morning of April 4, King was gunned down by a white assassin named James Earl Ray. Riots spread through American cities as African Americans mourned the death of their most revered leader. Black power advocates saw the murder as another sign that white power must be met with similar force. As the decade came to a close, there were few remaining examples of legal discrimination. But across the land, de facto segregation loomed large. Many schools were hardly integrated and African Americans struggled to claim their fair share of the economic pie.
