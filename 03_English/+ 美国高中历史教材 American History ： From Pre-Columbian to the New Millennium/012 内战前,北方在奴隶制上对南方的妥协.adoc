== 内战前,北方在奴隶制上对南方的妥协

=== 内战前, 南北双方在"奴隶制"上的妥协, 目的是为了保持联邦不分裂

"The PECULIAR 怪异的；奇怪的；不寻常的 INSTITUTION 机构;（由来已久的）风俗习惯，制度" is slavery. +
Its history in America begins (v.) with the earliest European settlements and ends (v.) with the Civil War. +
Yet its echo continues to reverberate (v.)回响；回荡 loudly. +
Slavery existed both in the north and in the South, at times in equal measure （一定的）量，程度. +
The industrialization of the north and the expansion of demand for cotton in the south `谓` shifted the balance so that it became a regional issue, as the southern economy `谓` grew increasingly reliant (a.)依赖的，依靠的 on cheap labor.

[.my2]
“特殊制度”就是**奴隶制。它在美国的历史, 始于最早的欧洲定居点，结束于内战。**然而它的回声, 仍然响亮地回荡着。奴隶制在北方和南方都存在，有时程度相当。北方的工业化, 和南方对棉花需求的扩大, 改变了平衡，使其成为一个地区性问题，因为南方经济越来越依赖廉价劳动力。

The Peculiar Institution refused to die. +
Great Britain had outlawed the slave trade *long before* its former American colonies.

[.my2]
特殊机构拒绝消亡。英国早在其前美洲殖民地之前, 就已宣布奴隶贸易为非法。

New nations in the Western Hemisphere, such as Mexico, often banned slavery /upon 一…即…，一…就… achieving independence.

[.my2]
西半球的新国家，例如墨西哥，在获得独立后, 往往禁止奴隶制。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.upon
在这句话中，"upon" 的意思是“在……之后”或者“随着”。所以整句话的意思是：“西半球的新国家，比如墨西哥，在获得独立后通常会禁止奴隶制。”

But in America, `主` political, religious, economic and social arguments 后定 *in favor of* 赞同；支持 the continuation of slavery `谓` emerged. +
Slavery became a completely sectional issue, as few states above the MASON-DIXON LINE still permitted 允许；（使）有可能；批准 human bondage. +
These arguments also revealed _the growing separation_ in _the needs and priorities_ 优先事项；最重要的事；首要事情 of _the northern industrial interests_ versus （比较两种不同想法、选择等）与…相对，与…相比 _the southern planting society_, all of which culminated (v.)到达顶点，达到高潮;（以某种结果）告终；（在某一点）结束 in the Civil War.

[.my2]
但在美国，支持"奴隶制继续存在"的政治、宗教、经济和社会论据出现了。奴隶制成为一个完全地区性的问题，因为"梅森-迪克森线"以上的几个州, 仍然允许奴役人类。这些论点还揭示了北方工业利益, 和南方种植社会之间, 在"需求"和"优先事项"上的日益分化. 所有这些, 都在内战中达到顶峰。

Defenders of slavery noted (v.) that in the Bible, Abraham had slaves. +
They point to the Ten Commandments 诫命；戒律, noting that "Thou 你；尔，汝 shalt (义同shall) not covet (v.)渴望；贪求（尤指别人的东西）；觊觎 thy 你的 neighbor's house, ... nor his manservant 男仆；仆役, nor his maidservant 女佣，女仆."  +
In the New Testament (证据；证明)新约全书, Paul *returned* 带回；送回；放回；退还 a runaway slave, Philemon, *to* his master, and, although slavery was widespread throughout the Roman world, Jesus never spoke out 大声说出 against it.

[.my2]
奴隶制的捍卫者指出，在圣经中，亚伯拉罕有奴隶。他们提到《十诫》，指出“不可贪图邻舍的房屋……也不可贪图他的男仆、女仆”。在新约中，保罗将逃跑的奴隶腓利门归还给他的主人，尽管奴隶制在整个罗马世界很普遍，但耶稣从未公开反对它。

Defenders of slavery argued that /by comparison with 与……相比较 the poor of Europe and the workers in the Northern states, that slaves were better cared (v.)照料；照顾；照看；护理 for. +
They said that their owners would protect and assist them when they were sick and aged, unlike those who, once fired from their work, were left to fend (v.)照料自己；自谋生计 helplessly for themselves.

[.my2]
奴隶制的捍卫者认为，与欧洲的穷人和北方各州的工人相比，奴隶得到了更好的照顾。他们说，当他们生病或年老时，主人会保护和帮助他们，不像那些一旦被解雇就只能自力更生的人。

Another seed of sectional conflict had been deeply planted.

[.my2]
即使在内战前夕，废奴主义者始终是少数。他们结束人类束缚的顽强决心是一场持续了数十年的斗争。虽然一开始基本上是和平的，但随着双方的根基越来越牢固，笔就变成了刀剑。另一领域冲突的种子已经深深埋下。

The land obtained from Mexico quickly became the subject 主题；题目；话题；题材；问题 of a bitter feud 长期不和；争吵不休；世仇；夙怨 between the NORTHERN WHIGS and the SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS. +
Abolitionists rightly feared that /`主` attempts `谓` would be made to plant (v.) cotton in the new territory, which would bring the blight （对局势、生活或环境）有害的事物，不利因素;（农作物等的）枯萎病，疫病 of slavery. +
Slaveholders feared that if slavery were prohibited in the new territory, southern slaveholding (a.)蓄奴的；拥有奴隶的 states would lose power in Congress.

[.my2]
从墨西哥获得的土地, 很快成为北方"辉格党"和南方"民主党"之间激烈争斗的对象。废奴主义者担心, 有人会试图在新领土上种植棉花，这会带来奴隶制的祸害，这是有道理的。奴隶主则担心，如果新领土上禁止奴隶制，南方蓄奴州将失去在国会的权力。

[.my2]
*美国的创始人, 在宪法中没有对奴隶制问题留下明确的解决方案。人民主权、修正案、废止和分裂, 都作为可能的补救措施进行了讨论。* 1850 年妥协案的通过, 避免了冲突。这一次，冷静的头脑占了上风。

[.my1]
.案例

.Compromise of 1850
1850年妥协案. 是美国国会于1850年9月通过的有关奴隶制问题的5个法案的通称。该妥协案的通过使得联邦政府以和平的方式暂时得以保全。

1787年修订的宪法条款中有几处涉及到奴隶制的地方，但是表述都含混不清。这为南北之间更大的冲突埋下隐患。

1804年，由于南北方矛盾愈演愈烈，联邦政府不得不决定以“梅松一狄克逊线”(即1767年划定的马里兰和宾夕法尼亚的边界线，位于北纬39°43’)，作为划分南部蓄奴州和北部自由州的分界线。之后南北各自向西平行推移，没有发生大的冲突，北部的资本主义制度和南部的奴隶制度在一定程度上“和平共存”。

image:/img/Mason-Dixon line 4.jpg[,95%]


但是随着美国领土不断向西扩张，新州不断加入联邦。南北两方都关注新州将推行何种社会经济制度。根据宪法，每个新州将会在参议院中有两个席位，这必将打破南北之间在经济和政治上原有的平衡。1820年，参议员亨利·克莱提出了著名的“Missouri Compromise (密苏里妥协案)”，把原定的南北分界线改为36°30’，所有分界线以北的州为自由州。这使得南北双方大体维持了平衡的局面，之后20多年未发生重大的冲突.

image:/img/Missouri Compromise.jpg[,95%]


19世纪40年代，美国在美墨战争中获得西部广袤的土地，包括加利福尼亚和新墨西哥等地。南北之间就这些领土是以"自由州"还是"蓄奴州"加入联邦的问题, 展开了激烈的辩论。南部各州力图扩大奴隶制的地域，并以脱离联邦相威胁。国家再一次面临分裂的局势。辉格党领袖亨利·克莱等人为了缓解冲突，自1850年初先后向国会提出一系列妥协性议案。

国会通过如下5个法案： +
- 准许加利福尼亚作为"自由州"加入联邦 +
- 在哥伦比亚地区废除奴隶贸易 +
- 政府不得干涉新墨西哥领地和犹他组织领地的奴隶制问题 +
- 从得克萨斯划出32.4万平方千米土地并入新墨西哥，由联邦政府付给补偿费1000万美元
- 制定一项新的"缉捕逃亡奴隶"的严峻法律 +

As the Mexican War drew to a close and no compromise could be reached in the Wilmot argument, the campaign for President became heated 加热了的, 愤怒的；激烈的. +
The Democratic _standard 行为标准；道德水准;仪式上使用的旗帜；（尤指）军旗 bearer_ （尤指在礼仪中）持…者, LEWIS CASS of Michigan, coined the term "POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY 民众主权" for a new solution that had begun to emerge. +
The premise was simple. +
Let the people of the territories themselves decide whether slavery would be permitted. +
The solution seemed perfect. +
In a country that has championed democracy, letting the people decide seemed right, if not obvious.

[.my2]
随着墨西哥战争接近尾声，威尔莫特的争论无法达成妥协，总统竞选变得白热化。民主党旗手、密歇根州的刘易斯·卡斯为已经开始出现的新解决方案, 创造了“人民主权”一词。前提很简单。**让这些领土的人民, 自己决定是否允许奴隶制。**这个解决方案看起来很完美。在一个崇尚民主的国家，让人民来决定似乎是正确的，即使不是显而易见的。

[.my1]

.standard bearer
倡导者；旗手

.popular sovereignty
N(in the pre-Civil War US) the doctrine that the inhabitants of a territory should be free from federal interference in determining their own domestic policy, esp in deciding whether or not to allow slavery (美国内战前)民众主权; 认为一个领土的居民应该摆脱联邦干涉，自由决定内政，尤其是决定是否允许奴隶制度

Popular sovereignty is the principle that the leaders of a state and its government are created and sustained 维持，保持 by the consent of its people, who are the source of all political legitimacy 合法性，合理性. Popular sovereignty, being a principle, does not imply any particular political implementation 实施，执行.

人民主权是这样的原则：一个国家及其政府的领导人是由人民同意产生和维持的，人民是一切政治合法性的源泉。人民主权作为一项原则，并不意味着任何特定的政治实施。

Republics and popular monarchies 君主制 are theoretically based on popular sovereignty. However, a legalistic notion 概念，想法 of popular sovereignty does not necessarily imply an effective, functioning democracy 民主政体. A party or even an individual dictator  独裁者；专横的人 may claim to represent the will of the people and rule (v.) in its name, which would be congruent (v.)适合的；适当的；恰当的；相称的 with Hobbes's view on the subject. Most modern definitions present (v.) democracy as a necessary condition of popular sovereignty.

理论上，共和国和人民君主制, 都是以人民主权为基础的。然而，人民主权的法律主义概念并不一定意味着有效的、运转良好的民主。一个政党甚至一个独裁者可以声称代表人民的意志并以其名义进行统治，这与霍布斯的观点是一致的。大多数现代定义都将民主视为人民主权的必要条件。

====

However simple _popular sovereignty_ seemed, it was difficult to put into practice. +
By what means would the people decide? Directly or indirectly? If a popular vote were scheduled 安排；将……列入计划表, what guarantees (n.)保证，担保 could be made against voter fraud 欺诈罪；欺骗罪? If slavery were voted down 否决, would the individuals who already owned slaves be allowed to keep them?


[.my2]
"人民主权"看似简单，但落实起来却困难重重。人民将通过什么方式做出决定？直接还是间接？如果安排全民投票，可以采取哪些措施来防止选民欺诈？如果奴隶制被否决，那些已经拥有奴隶的人是否可以保留奴隶？

HENRY CLAY of Kentucky, JOHN C. CALHOUN of South Carolina, and DANIEL WEBSTER of Massachusetts `谓` dominated national politics from the end of the War of 1812 until their deaths in the early 1850s. +
Although none would ever be President, the collective impact 集体影响 they created in Congress was far greater than any President of the era, with the exception of 除了…之外 Andrew Jackson. +

There was one issue that loomed 赫然耸现；（尤指）令人惊恐地隐现;显得突出；逼近 over the nation throughout their time in power — slavery. +
They were continuously successful in keeping peace in America by forging a series of compromises. +
The next generation's leaders were not.

[.my2]
肯塔基州的亨利·克莱、南卡罗来纳州的约翰·C·卡尔霍恩, 和马萨诸塞州的丹尼尔·韦伯斯特, 从 1812 年战争结束, 到 1850 年代初去世，一直主导着国家政治。尽管没有人成为总统，但他们在国会产生的集体影响, 远远超过了那个时代的任何一位总统（安德鲁·杰克逊除外）。*在他们执政期间，有一个问题一直笼罩着这个国家——奴隶制。他们通过达成一系列妥协，不断成功地维持了美国的和平。下一代领导人则不然。*

.Henry Clay 亨利·克莱

+
他因善于调解冲突的两方，并数次解决南北方关于奴隶制的矛盾, 维护了联邦的稳定, 而被称为“伟大的调解者”，并在1957年被评选为美国历史上最伟大的五位参议员之一。

image:/img/Henry Clay.jpg[,30%]



*1820年, 南北双方为新加入联邦的"密苏里州"是否采用"蓄奴"爆发了争论。在克莱的调解下，双方同意采用"密苏里妥协案 Missouri Compromise"，即将"密苏里州"划为蓄奴州，"缅因州"为自由州，以保持参议院中"自由州"和"蓄奴州"议员数目相等，且除密苏里州以外, 不得将奴隶制扩展到北纬36度30分线以北（阿肯色州的北部边界）。*

image:/img/035.jpg[,95%]

image:/img/035.png[,95%]

克莱的政治能力毋庸置疑，但他坚持通过美国系统, 来发展经济, 和控制奴隶制的发展, 在当时非常不受南方的欢迎. +
曾经有人规劝他能否不采取如此强硬的反对奴隶制和发展工业的姿态，克莱回答了一句, 后来常被引用的政治名言：“比起当总统，我宁可选择真理。”


参议院里充满了南北两方对于"奴隶制在新从墨西哥获得的土地上是否推行"的争论，南方以退出联邦作为威胁。*克莱继续发挥他的调和能力，终于促使双方达成了"1850年妥协案"，这一被称为“火山口上的盖子”的法案规定: 加利福尼亚州以"自由州"加入联邦，"新墨西哥州"和"犹他州"由居民自己决定，从而缓解了南方退出联邦的危机，被认为将美国南北战争拖延了11年。*

他是19世纪前半叶最著名的美国政治家之一.

虽然卡尔霍恩在美国南北战争爆发前十年就逝世了，但他是后来短命的"美利坚联盟国"的主要精神设计师。卡尔霍恩享有“铸铁人”之称，原因是他毫不动摇地坚持他的信仰。**他提出了"无效论"的理论。这个极端理论的内容是: 任何州在认为任何"联邦法律"违反宪法的话, 可以宣称这个法律无效。他是"奴隶制"的强烈支持者。**他对奴隶制的强烈维护, 是南方针对北方不断增强的反奴隶制态度开始威胁退出联邦的因素之一。




.Daniel Webster 丹尼尔·韦伯斯特
韦伯斯特是19世纪美国最杰出的律师之一. +
他与亨利·克莱（Henry Clay）, 和约翰·卡尔霍恩（John C. Calhoun）, 并称 "三巨头"。

他强烈反对约翰·C·卡尔霍恩（John C. Calhoun）主张的废止论。 +
人们普遍认为韦伯斯特是一位重要而有才华的律师、演说家和政治家，但历史学家和观察家对他作为国家领导人的道德品质和能力却褒贬不一。

*新州在成为"州"之前, 被组织成"自治领土"。因此，他们早在加入联邦之前, 就已经就"奴隶制问题"定下了立场。南方人认为, 所有领土都必须允许奴隶制。北方人认为奴隶制不得扩展到新的领土。*

.The Kansas-Nebraska Act
1854年由斯蒂芬·道格拉斯提起的法案. 堪萨斯-内布拉斯加州法案, **开放新加入的"堪萨斯州"以及"内布拉斯加州"这两个州，由当地居民自由选择是否允许蓄奴。**尽管引致巨大批评声浪，此法案依然通过，酿成了堪萨斯流血事件，并最后导致南北战争。

其实道格拉斯意图**修建横贯美国的铁路，**以加强美东与美西的交通。但**由于需经过当时是蓄奴州的密苏里州，**为了争取其他国会议员的支持，道格拉斯打算终止密苏里折衷案。要求新加入联邦的"堪萨斯"和"内布拉斯加"两州（均在北纬36.5°以北）由当地居民自行决定是否为蓄奴州。*道格拉斯说法是，他支持"人民主权论"，故应该由当地人民决定。*

此法案受到亚伯拉罕·林肯等反对奴隶制扩张的人和废奴主义者强烈反对.

The KANSAS-NEBRASKA ACT OF 1854 may have been the single most significant event leading to the Civil War. +

By the early 1850s /settlers and entrepreneurs wanted to move into the area now known as Nebraska. +
However, until the area was organized as a territory （美国）准州, settlers would not move there because they could not legally hold a claim on the land. +
The southern states' representatives in Congress `系` were in no hurry to permit a Nebraska territory because the land lay north of the 36°30' parallel （地球或地图的）纬线，纬圈 — where slavery had been outlawed by the Missouri Compromise of 1820. +
Just when things between the north and south were in an uneasy balance, Kansas and Nebraska opened fresh wounds.

[.my2]
1854 年的《堪萨斯-内布拉斯加州法案》可能是导致内战的最重大事件。到 1850 年代初，定居者和企业家想要搬到现在称为"内布拉斯加州"的地区。然而，在该地区被组织为领土之前，定居者不会搬到那里，因为他们无法合法地拥有这片土地的所有权。国会中南方各州的代表, 并不急于批准"内布拉斯加州"的领土，因为该土地位于北纬 36°30' 纬线以北——1820 年的"密苏里妥协案"已宣布该线以北的土地, 奴隶制为非法。在不稳定的平衡中，"堪萨斯州"和"内布拉斯加州"又揭开了新的伤口。

[.my2]
堪萨斯-内布拉斯加州法案, 在堪萨斯地区引发了一系列事件，预示了内战。


The person behind the Kansas-Nebraska Act was SENATOR STEPHEN A.
DOUGLAS of Illinois.

[.my2]
堪萨斯-内布拉斯加州法案的发起者, 是伊利诺伊州参议员斯蒂芬·A·道格拉斯。

He said he wanted to see Nebraska made into a territory and, to win southern support, proposed (v.)提议；计划 a southern state 后定 inclined (a.)有…倾向；很可能 to support slavery.
It was Kansas. +

Underlying it all `系` was his desire to build a transcontinental 横贯大陆的 railroad to go through Chicago. +

image:/img/Chicago.jpg[,95%]

The Kansas-Nebraska Act allowed each territory to decide the issue of slavery *on the basis of* popular sovereignty. +
Kansas with slavery would violate (v.) the Missouri Compromise, which had kept the Union from *falling apart* for the last thirty-four years. +
The long-standing 长期存在的；存在已久的 compromise would have to be repealed 废除，撤销，废止（法规）. +

Opposition was intense, but ultimately the bill passed in May of 1854. +
Territory 后定 north of the sacred 36°30' line `系`  was now open to _popular sovereignty_.
The North was outraged.

[.my2]
他说，他希望看到内布拉斯加州成为美国领土，并且, 为了赢得南方的支持，他提议建立一个倾向于支持奴隶制的南方州。那是"堪萨斯州"。这一切的背后, 是源于他想建造一条穿越芝加哥的横贯美国大陆的铁路。"堪萨斯-内布拉斯加州法案"允许每个领土在"人民主权"的基础上, 自行决定奴隶制问题。**但堪萨斯州实行奴隶制, 将违反"密苏里妥协案"，该妥协案在过去三十四年里使联邦免于分裂。**长期存在的妥协将被废除, 反对声音很激烈，但该法案最终于 1854 年 5 月获得通过。*神圣的 36°30' 线以北的领土, 现已向"人民主权"(来决定奴隶制)开放。北方愤怒了。*


The Kansas-Nebraska act made it possible for the Kansas and Nebraska territories (shown in orange) to open to slavery. +
The Missouri Compromise had prevented this from happening since 1820.

[.my2]
堪萨斯-内布拉斯加州法案, 使堪萨斯和内布拉斯加州领土（以橙色显示）开放奴隶制成为可能。而自 1820 年以来，"密苏里妥协案"成阻止了这种情况的发生的。

Most of the southern Whigs soon were swept into  the Democratic Party. +
Northern Whigs reorganized themselves [with other non-slavery interests (n.)利害与共者；利益团体] to become _the REPUBLICAN PARTY_, the party of Abraham Lincoln. +
This left _the Democratic Party_ as _the sole 唯一的，仅有的 remaining institution_ that crossed sectional （社团或组织中）某群体的，某阶层的 lines. +

Animosity 憎恶，仇恨，敌意 between the North and South was again on the rise 在增加；在上涨. +

Trouble was indeed back with a vengeance 报复；报仇；复仇.

[.my2]
道格拉斯法案的政治影响是巨大的。**该法案的通过, 不可避免地分裂了当时美国两大政党之一的辉格党。每个北方辉格党人都反对这项法案。而几乎所有南方辉格党人都投了赞成票。**由于涉及奴隶制的情感问题，无法找到共同点。**大多数南方辉格党人很快就被纳入"民主党"。北方辉格党与其他非奴隶制利益集团重组，成为"共和党"，即亚伯拉罕·林肯的政党。**这使得民主党成为唯一剩余的还能连接着南北地域的机构。南北之间的仇恨再次升温。**北方认为，如果忽视 1820 年妥协案，那么 1850 年妥协案也可以被忽视。**违反令人憎恶的《逃亡奴隶法》的行为有所增加。麻烦确实又来了。

===== 堪萨斯州的分裂 (反对奴隶制者, 与支持蓄奴者之间的分裂)

The passage 通过 of the Kansas-Nebraska Act would lead to a civil war between pro-slavery and anti-slavery settlers in Kansas.

[.my2]
堪萨斯-内布拉斯加州法案的通过将导致堪萨斯州支持奴隶制和反奴隶制定居者之间的内战。

Slavery was quite likely (a.)可能发生的 to be outlawed in Nebraska, where cotton doesn't grow well. +
The situation in Kansas was entirely different, where the land was similar to Missouri's, which was a slave state. +
Kansas was to be governed by the principle of _popular sovereignty_. +
Whether Kansas was to be slave or free `谓` would be decided at the polls. +
Both free and slave forces were determined to hold sway (摇摆；摆动)占主导地位；掌控；支配.

[.my2]
在内布拉斯加州，奴隶制很可能被取缔，因为那里的棉花长势不佳。堪萨斯州的情况则完全不同，那里的土地与密苏里州相似，都是奴隶制州。堪萨斯州将遵循人民主权原则。堪萨斯州是奴隶制还是自由州将由民意调查决定。自由势力和奴隶势力都决心要占据主导地位。

Missouri counties that bordered Kansas `系`  were strongly pro-slavery and wanted their neighbor to be a slave state. +
In the fall of 1854, SENATOR 参议员 DAVID ATCHISON of Missouri led over 1,700 men from Missouri into Kansas to vote for their pro-slavery representative 代表，代理人. +
These were the infamous 臭名远扬的；声名狼藉的 "BORDER RUFFIANS 流氓，恶棍," who threatened to shoot (v.), burn and hang (v.) those opposed to slavery.

[.my2]
*与"堪萨斯州"接壤的"密苏里州"各县, 强烈支持奴隶制，并希望他们的邻居成为奴隶州。* 1854 年秋天，密苏里州参议员戴维·艾奇逊 (David Atchison) 率领 1,700 多名**密苏里州男子, 前往堪萨斯州投票, 以支持奴隶制代表 (不是本州人, 怎么能投票本州事物呢?!)。**这些人就是臭名昭著的“边境恶棍”，他们威胁要射杀、烧死和绞死那些反对奴隶制的人。

Although their votes were later ruled (v.) fraudulent 欺诈的，诈骗的, their candidate 候选人，申请者 was elected to Congress. +
When it came time to elect a territorial legislature the following March, almost 5,000 men came into the state from Missouri to cast illegal ballots 非法投票. +
Pro-slavery forces had the numbers, not the ethics 行为准则，道德原则, on their side. +
Anti-slavery settlers, though the majority in Kansas, were outvoted (v.)以多数票击败,得票超过. +
The result of the election through fraud `系` was a legislature 立法机关；立法机构 with 36 pro-slavery delegates 代表；会议代表 and 3 anti-slavery delegates.

[.my2]
**尽管他们的选票后来被裁定为欺诈，但他们的候选人, 还是当选为国会议员。**当次年 3 月选举领土立法机构时，**近 5,000 名男子从"密苏里州"来到该州进行非法投票。**支持奴隶制势力, 有数量上的实质性支持，而不仅仅是只在道德上支持。**反奴隶制定居者, 虽然在堪萨斯州占多数，但在投票中落败(被击败)。**通过舞弊选举后的结果是，立法机构中有36名支持奴隶制的代表, 和3名反对奴隶制的代表。


As one of their first acts, this legislature passed a harsh slave code 法典；法规 that provided (v.) fines 罚款 and imprisonment 监禁，关押 simply for expressing (v.)表达；表达观点 opinions against slavery. +
The _death penalty_ 死刑 would be administered 执行 to any individual 后定 found guilty of assisting (v.)协助 slaves to revolt (v.)（对权威、规定、法律的）反抗，违抗；叛乱，造反 or escape. +

[.my2]
作为他们的第一个行动，该立法机构通过了一项严厉的奴隶法，仅仅因为表达反对奴隶制的意见, 就会被处以罚款和监禁。任何被判"协助奴隶叛乱或逃跑的人", 都将被判处"死刑"。*它还使“边境流氓”投票合法化，不要求选民在投票前必须是"堪萨斯州居民"，并使该法律追溯至之前的选举 (违反了"法律不溯及以往"的原则)。*

Within a year, the population of anti-slavery residents in Kansas far outnumbered (v.)（在数量上）压倒，比…多 legal residents of Kansas who were pro-slavery. +

The result was a state with two governments. +
Violence would soon follow.

**一年之内，堪萨斯州反奴隶制居民的人数, 就远远超过了堪萨斯州支持奴隶制的合法居民。他们不准备遵守位于肖尼使命的“假立法机关”的法律。他们以“自由土地者”的名义组织起来，制定了自由州宪法，并选举了位于托皮卡的独立州长和州立法机构。结果是一个拥有两个政府的州 (州分裂了)。**暴力很快就会随之而来。

.SHAWNEE MISSION
image:/img/SHAWNEE MISSION.jpg[,95%]



.Bleeding Kansas 堪薩斯內戰
是1854年至1858年之間一系列围绕奴隸制的衝突。这场冲突发生在当时未建州的"堪萨斯领地", 和临近的密苏里州，起因是南北方支持与反对奴隶制度的双方, 试图争夺堪萨斯领土的控制权，以决定堪萨斯是否以"蓄奴州"或"自由州"身份加入联邦。衝突特點為多年的選舉舞弊、突襲、襲擊以及報復仇殺。这场冲突對当时美国中部的政局，以及之後美國南北戰爭有重要影響。

*美国联邦政府与国会, 一直试图保持联邦内"自由州"与"奴隶州"的势力平衡。* +
*起初，1820年通过的"密苏里折衷案"规定, 凡是北纬36度30分以北的州, 一律为"自由州"（密苏里州除外），以南为"蓄奴州"。* +
*然而，1854年通过的"堪薩斯-內布拉斯加法案", 却推翻了长期保持南北势力平衡的"密苏里折衷案"。此法案规定, 即将加入联邦的"堪萨斯"与"内布拉斯加"两地居民, 可以自行投票选择"奴隶州"或是"自由州"的身份。由于这两个州都位于北纬36度30分以北，所以引起了巨大的争议。* +

-> 反对奴隶制度的北方人认为, 这个法案会使原本应属于自由州地盘的堪萨斯州, 摇身一变成为蓄奴州。 +
-> 而支持奴隶制度的南方人认为，**如果容忍堪萨斯成为自由州，身為蓄奴州的密苏里州将被自由州三面包围，**陷入地理上的不利境地。

image:/img/039-4 Slavery-in-1860-map.webp[,95%]


堪萨斯州无论加入哪方阵营，都有可能使美国南北双方在国会内势力失衡。因此，**双方为了在堪萨斯州取得人头数上的优势，派遣了大量的移民, 移往堪萨斯地区。**并为了争夺地盘发生了大量的流血冲突。在当时，**两派都在堪萨斯成立了独立的地方政府，**各有轄下城市，各有自己一套憲法：一為自由，一為蓄奴。*兩派各自聲稱是合法的州政府。1861年1月29日，堪萨斯州终于以"自由州"身份加入了联邦，废奴主义获得胜利。仅仅在不到三个月后，南北战争爆发。*

===== 德雷德·斯科特案 (到过自由州的奴隶, 是否能自动获得自由身?)

Between 1856 and 1860, America would see a breakdown （关系的）破裂；（讨论、系统的）失败 in many of its political processes that had developed over the last eight decades. +
The GREAT COMPROMISERS of the early 19th century — Daniel Webster, Henry Clay and John Calhoun — were gone, and their leadership in avoiding disunion 分裂；分开；不统一 were gone as well. +

Forces on the extremes were becoming more and more powerful, reducing the influence of moderates 温和派 /and crippling (v.)使残废；使跛；使成瘸子;严重毁坏（或损害） the spirit of reconciliation 调解；和解. +
Front and center was the issue of slavery. +
Could the country be saved, or was it on an irrevocable 无法改变的；不可更改的 path toward disunion?

[.my2]
1856 年至 1860 年间，美国过去八年发展起来的许多政治进程, 都出现了崩溃。 19 世纪初期伟大的妥协者——丹尼尔·韦伯斯特, 亨利·克莱, 和约翰·卡尔霍恩——都已经去世了，他们在避免分裂方面的领导力, 也消失了。如今, 极端势力越来越强大，削弱了温和派的影响力，削弱了和解精神。首要和中心问题是"奴隶制问题"。联邦能否被挽救，还是走向分裂的不可挽回的道路？

The Congress and the Presidents of the past decade `谓` had failed to resolve the burning 很重要的迫切问题；当务之急 issue of slavery in the territories. +
Could the Supreme Court, the highest law in the land, put the issue to rest (v.)休息；放松;被搁置；中止? Politicians and the American public hoped it could determine some _long term framework_ for settlement of the slavery issue. +

An opportunity was presented when _the Dred Scott case_ reached the High Court. +
As a slave having lived in a free territory, was he now free when he returned to a slave state? No. +
And more — neither a state nor Congress had the right to outlaw (v.)宣布…不合法；使…成为非法 slavery.

[.my2]
**过去十年, 美国的三个权力分支 -- "国会"和"总统"都未能解决领土上这些紧迫的奴隶制问题。那么"最高法院"，这个国家的最高法律，能解决这个问题吗？**政客和美国公众希望, 它能确定"解决奴隶制问题"的长期框架。当德雷德·斯科特案, 提交高等法院时，一个机会出现了。作为一个生活在自由领土上的奴隶，当他回到奴隶州时，他还是自由身吗？不是自由身。而且，州和国会都还未能有权力,来取缔奴隶制。

.斯科特诉桑福德案
黑人奴隶德雷德·斯科特, 随主人到过自由州"伊利诺伊", 和自由准州（Territory）"威斯康星"，并居住了两年，随后回到蓄奴州"密苏里"。主人死后，斯科特提起诉讼要求获得自由，案件在"密苏里州最高法院"和"联邦法院"被驳回后，斯科特上诉到"美国最高法院"。
.
image:/img/041.png[,95%]

美国最高法院审理期间, 由于《堪萨斯-内布拉斯加法案》和“流血的堪萨斯”的影响，此案被广泛关注，当选总统"詹姆斯·布坎南", 和后来的总统"亚伯拉罕·林肯", 都在公众场合表示将等待并服从最高法院的判决.

法庭就以下两个问题进行法庭辩论： +
1.关于此案，美国联邦法庭是否具有听取和判决双方当事人的审判权？ +
2.如果具有审判权，它的判决是否正确？


最终9位大法官以 7：2的票数维持原判. 主要论述为：

1.即便自由的黑人, 也不是《美国宪法》中所指的公民，所以斯科特无权在联邦法院提起诉讼. +
(意思是认为黑人不是公民，无权在联邦法庭起诉他的主人.)  +
-> 在反对奴隶制的人看来, 这种判决会带来, *如果自由黑人不能获得公民权，那么限制奴隶制的立法权将流于形式.*

2.威斯康星"准州", 排除奴隶制的是《密苏里妥协案》，而由国会制定《密苏里妥协案》, 超出了国会的宪法权力.(意思是国会的此法《密苏里妥协案》违宪了.) +
-> 这也是最高法院历史上第二次使用"司法审查权", 推翻国会通过的法案. +
第一次是54年前的“马伯里诉麦迪逊案”。坦尼从两方面论述《密苏里妥协案》违宪。


案判决結果严重损害了"美国最高法院"的威望，更成为南北战争的关键起因之一。

*南北战争后, "美国宪法"增加了《第十三修正案》、《第十四修正案》和《第十五修正案》，从而废除了美国的奴隶制，并规定非裔美国人具有平等公民权。*


背景:

1848年，**美墨战争结束，美国获得大片土地，**包括加利福尼亚州、犹他州、内华达州的全部，以及科罗拉多州、新墨西哥州、亚利桑那州、怀俄明州的部分，*于是"准州区域"的奴隶制扩展问题, 纷争再起，政治冲突愈演愈烈，在紧接着的十年中成为首要的政治问题.*

**反对奴隶制的观点认为：国会有权在美国所属的领土上制定法律，当然包括准州的奴隶制问题；**并且认为国会负有在其管辖区内禁止奴隶制的道德义务，*提出“自由必须是全国性的，而奴隶制只能是区域性的”。*

南方人则提出了相反观点，南方的代表人物是前副总统"约翰·卡尔霍恩"。*他认为, 这些准州地区是本联邦共有的财产, 这些"准州地区"是各州的联合财产；由于各州公共的使用而被共同占有. +
因此, 联邦政府并不能阻止任何一州的公民, 把法律上已获得其家乡州认可的财产, 带入准州地区。 (其实, 这里他是混淆了概念, 就如同把属于私人的产权房(独立州), 看做是业主共享的公摊面积,会所一样. )*

From the 1780s, the question of whether slavery would be permitted in new territories had threatened the Union. +
Over the decades 数十年来, many compromises had been made to avoid disunion. +
But what did the Constitution say on this subject? This question was raised in 1857 before the Supreme Court in case of DRED SCOTT VS. SANDFORD. +

DRED SCOTT was a slave of an army surgeon 外科医生, John Emerson. +
Scott had been taken from Missouri to _posts (n.)职位；（尤指）要职 后定 in Illinois and what is now Minnesota_ for several years in the 1830s, before returning to Missouri. +
The Missouri Compromise of 1820 had declared the area including MINNESOTA 宾补 free. +


[.my1]
.案例
====
在这句话中，"posts" 是名词，意思是“岗位”或“驻地”。加 "s" 是因为它是复数形式，表示多个岗位或驻地。整句话的意思是：“斯科特是军医约翰·埃默森的奴隶。在1830年代，斯科特被从密苏里带到伊利诺伊州和现在的明尼苏达州的多个驻地，待了几年后又回到密苏里州。”
====

In 1846, Scott sued (v.)要求，请求 for his freedom *on the grounds that* 由于（根据） he had lived in a free state and a free territory for a prolonged 长期的，持续很久的 period of time. +
Finally, after eleven years, his case reached the Supreme Court. +
*At stake* 成败难料；得失都可能；有风险 were answers to critical questions, including slavery in the territories and citizenship 公民资格，公民身份 of African-Americans. +
The verdict （法庭的）裁定，判决；（权威的）评判，定论；意见，决定;（经过检验或认真考虑后的）决定，结论，意见 was a bombshell 出乎意料的事情，意外消息（常指不幸）.


[.my2]
**从 1780 年代起，新领土上是否允许奴隶制的问题, 就一直威胁着联邦。几十年来，为了避免分裂，人们做出了许多妥协。但宪法在这个问题上是怎么说的呢？**这个问题于 1857 年在最高法院 DRED SCOTT 诉 案中被提出。桑福德。德雷德·斯科特是陆军外科医生约翰·爱默生的奴隶。 1830 年代，斯科特从密苏里州被带到伊利诺伊州和现在的明尼苏达州任职数年，然后返回密苏里州。 1820 年的密苏里妥协案, 曾宣布包括明尼苏达在内的地区为自由州。 1846年，斯科特以长期生活在自由州和自由领土为由, 提起诉讼，要求获得自由。最终，十一年后，他的案子到达了最高法院。关键问题的答案至关重要，包括领土上的奴隶制和非裔美国人的公民身份。这个判决是一个重磅炸弹。

The Court ruled that `主` Scott's "sojourn" 逗留；旅居 of two years to Illinois and the Northwest Territory `谓` did not make him free once he returned to Missouri.

[.my2]
法院裁定，斯科特在伊利诺伊州和西北地区“逗留”两年并没有让他在返回密苏里州后获得自由。


The Court further ruled that /as a black man Scott was excluded from United States citizenship and could not, therefore, bring suit (起诉；控告某人)提起诉讼. +
According to the opinion of the Court, African-Americans had not been part of the "SOVEREIGN PEOPLE" 主权人民 who made the Constitution.

[.my2]
法院进一步裁定，作为一名黑人，斯科特被排除在美国公民身份之外，因此不能提起诉讼。根据法院的意见，非裔美国人不属于制定宪法的“主权人民”的一部分。

The Court also ruled that Congress never had the right to prohibit (v.)（通过法律、条例等）禁止；阻止，使不可能 slavery in any territory. +
Any ban on slavery was a violation of the Fifth Amendment, which prohibited denying _property rights_ 财产权 without _due (a.)适当的；恰当的；合适的 process_ 正当程序  of law.

*法院还裁定, 国会从未有权禁止任何领土上的奴隶制。任何对奴隶制的禁令, 都违反了"第五修正案"，该修正案禁止"未经正当法律程序剥夺财产权"的行为。 (这个宪法修正案的规定有效的前提是 -- 黑奴的确是属于"财产"才行. 但黑人满足这个前提条件吗?)*

=== 内战前, 南北双方在"奴隶制"上的妥协, 目的是为了保持联邦不分裂

"The PECULIAR INSTITUTION" is slavery. Its history in America begins with the earliest European settlements and ends with the Civil War. Yet its echo continues to reverberate loudly. Slavery existed both in the north and in the South, at times in equal measure. The industrialization of the north and the expansion of demand for cotton in the south shifted the balance so that it became a regional issue, as the southern economy grew increasingly reliant on cheap labor.

The Peculiar Institution refused to die. Great Britain had outlawed the slave trade long before its former American colonies.

New nations in the Western Hemisphere, such as Mexico, often banned slavery upon achieving independence.

But in America, political, religious, economic and social arguments in favor of the continuation of slavery emerged. Slavery became a completely sectional issue, as few states above the MASON-DIXON LINE still permitted human bondage. These arguments also revealed the growing separation in the needs and priorities of the northern industrial interests versus the southern planting society, all of which culminated in the Civil War.



Defenders of slavery noted that in the Bible, Abraham had slaves. They point to the Ten Commandments, noting that "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, ... nor his manservant, nor his maidservant." In the New Testament, Paul returned a runaway slave, Philemon, to his master, and, although slavery was widespread throughout the Roman world, Jesus never spoke out against it.

Defenders of slavery argued that by comparison with the poor of Europe and the workers in the Northern states, that slaves were better cared for. They said that their owners would protect and assist them when they were sick and aged, unlike those who, once fired from their work, were left to fend helplessly for themselves.

Abolitionists were always a minority, even on the eve of the Civil War. Their dogged determination to end human bondage was a struggle that persisted for decades. While mostly peaceful at first, as each side became more and more firmly rooted, pens were exchanged for swords. Another seed of sectional conflict had been deeply planted.



The land obtained from Mexico quickly became the subject of a bitter feud between the NORTHERN WHIGS and the SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS. Abolitionists rightly feared that attempts would be made to plant cotton in the new territory, which would bring the blight of slavery. Slaveholders feared that if slavery were prohibited in the new territory, southern slaveholding states would lose power in Congress.

The specter of secession had risen again. Desperately the elder statesmen of the federal legislature proposed methods of keeping the country together.


The country's founders left no clear solution to the issue of slavery in the Constitution. Popular sovereignty, amendment, nullification, and secession were all discussed as possible remedies. Conflict was avoided with the passing of the Compromise of 1850. The cooler heads prevailed — this time.


As the Mexican War drew to a close and no compromise could be reached in the Wilmot argument, the campaign for President became heated. The Democratic standard bearer, LEWIS CASS of Michigan, coined the term "POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY" for a new solution that had begun to emerge. The premise was simple. Let the people of the territories themselves decide whether slavery would be permitted. The solution seemed perfect. In a country that has championed democracy, letting the people decide seemed right, if not obvious.

However simple popular sovereignty seemed, it was difficult to put into practice. By what means would the people decide? Directly or indirectly? If a popular vote were scheduled, what guarantees could be made against voter fraud? If slavery were voted down, would the individuals who already owned slaves be allowed to keep them? Cass and the Democrats did not say. His opponent, Zachary Taylor, ignored the issue of slavery altogether in his campaign, and won the ELECTION OF 1848.

HENRY CLAY of Kentucky, JOHN C. CALHOUN of South Carolina, and DANIEL WEBSTER of Massachusetts dominated national politics from the end of the War of 1812 until their deaths in the early 1850s. Although none would ever be President, the collective impact they created in Congress was far greater than any President of the era, with the exception of Andrew Jackson. There was one issue that loomed over the nation throughout their time in power — slavery. They were continuously successful in keeping peace in America by forging a series of compromises. The next generation's leaders were not.


'''

===== 1850年妥协案: 加利福尼亚州以"自由州"加入联邦，"新墨西哥州"和"犹他州"由居民自己决定.

The Gold Rush led to the rapid settlement of California which resulted in its imminent admission as the 31st state. Southerners recognized that there were few slaves in California because Mexico had prohibited slavery. Immediate admission would surely mean California would be the 16th free state, giving the non-slave-holding states an edge in the Senate. Already holding the House of Representatives, the free states could then dominate legislation.



Texas was claiming land that was part of New Mexico. As a slave state, any expansion of the boundaries of Texas would be opening new land to slavery. northerners were opposed. The north was also appalled at the ongoing practice of slavery in the nation's capital — a practice the south was not willing to let go. The lines were drawn as the three Senatorial giants took the stage for the last critical time.

Henry Clay had brokered compromises before. When the Congress was divided in 1820 over the issue of slavery in the Louisiana Territory, Clay set forth the MISSOURI COMPROMISE. When South Carolina nullified the tariff in 1832, Clay saved the day with the COMPROMISE TARIFF OF 1833. After 30 years in Congress and three unsuccessful attempts at the Presidency, Clay wanted badly to make good with yet another nation-saving deal. He put forth a set of eight proposals that he hoped would pass muster with his colleagues.

By 1852, Clay, Calhoun, and Webster had all passed away. They left a rich legacy behind them. Clay of the West, Calhoun of the South, and Webster of the North loved and served their country greatly. The generation that followed produced no leader that could unite the country without the force of arms.


The Compromise of 1850

Clay's Compromise became law.


California was admitted to the Union as the 16th free state. In exchange, the south was guaranteed that no federal restrictions on slavery would be placed on Utah or New Mexico. Texas lost its boundary claims in New Mexico, but the Congress compensated Texas with $10 million. Slavery was maintained in the nation's capital, but the slave trade was prohibited. Finally, and most controversially, a FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW was passed, requiring northerners to return runaway slaves to their owners under penalty of law.


North Gets :

- California admitted as a free state
- Slave trade prohibited in Washington D.C.
- Texas loses boundary dispute with New Mexico

South Gets :

- No slavery restrictions in Utah or New Mexico territories
- Slaveholding permitted in Washington D.C.
- Texas gets $10 million
- Fugitive Slave Law

Who won and who lost in the deal? Although each side received benefits, the north seemed to gain the most. The balance of the Senate was now with the free states, although California often voted with the south on many issues in the 1850s. The major victory for the south was the Fugitive Slave Law. In the end, the north refused to enforce it. Massachusetts even called for its nullification, stealing an argument from John C. Calhoun. Northerners claimed the law was unfair. The flagrant violation of the Fugitive Slave Law set the scene for the tempest that emerged later in the decade. But for now, Americans hoped against hope that the fragile peace would prevail.

===== 堪萨斯-内布拉斯加州法案 : 终止"密苏里妥协案"。新加入联邦的"堪萨斯"和"内布拉斯加"两州（均在北纬36.5°以北）, 由当地居民自行决定是否为蓄奴州.

For decades, both northern states and southern states had threatened secession and dissolution of the Union over the question of where slavery was to be permitted. At issue was power. Both sides sought to limit the governing power of the other by maintaining a balance of membership in Congress. This meant ensuring that admission of a new state where slavery was outlawed was matched by a state permitting slavery. For example, at the same time that Missouri entered the Union as a slave state, Maine entered the Union as a free state.


New states were organized into self-governing territories before they became states. Hence, they developed a position on the slavery issue well before their admission to the Union. Southerners held that slavery must be permitted in all territories. Northerners held that slavery must not be extended into new territories.



If slavery were not permitted in the territories, slavery would never gain a foothold within them and southern power in Congress would gradually erode. If either side were successful in gaining a distinct advantage, many felt disunion and civil war would follow.

Kansas would be the battleground on which the north and south would first fight. The Kansas-Nebraska Act led both to statehood and to corruption, hatred, anger, and violence. Men from neighboring Missouri stuffed ballot boxes in Kansas to ensure that a legislature friendly to slavery would be elected. Anti-slavery, or free soil, settlers formed a legislature of their own in TOPEKA. Within two years, there would be armed conflict between proponents of slavery and those against it.


The KANSAS-NEBRASKA ACT OF 1854 may have been the single most significant event leading to the Civil War. By the early 1850s settlers and entrepreneurs wanted to move into the area now known as Nebraska. However, until the area was organized as a territory, settlers would not move there because they could not legally hold a claim on the land. The southern states' representatives in Congress were in no hurry to permit a Nebraska territory because the land lay north of the 36°30' parallel — where slavery had been outlawed by the Missouri Compromise of 1820. Just when things between the north and south were in an uneasy balance, Kansas and Nebraska opened fresh wounds.


The Kansas-Nebraska Act began a chain of events in the Kansas Territory that foreshadowed the Civil War.


The person behind the Kansas-Nebraska Act was SENATOR STEPHEN A. DOUGLAS of Illinois.

He said he wanted to see Nebraska made into a territory and, to win southern support, proposed a southern state inclined to support slavery. It was Kansas. Underlying it all was his desire to build a transcontinental railroad to go through Chicago. The Kansas-Nebraska Act allowed each territory to decide the issue of slavery on the basis of popular sovereignty. Kansas with slavery would violate the Missouri Compromise, which had kept the Union from falling apart for the last thirty-four years. The long-standing compromise would have to be repealed. Opposition was intense, but ultimately the bill passed in May of 1854. Territory north of the sacred 36°30' line was now open to popular sovereignty. The North was outraged.


The Kansas-Nebraska act made it possible for the Kansas and Nebraska territories (shown in orange) to open to slavery. The Missouri Compromise had prevented this from happening since 1820.



The political effects of Douglas' bill were enormous. Passage of the bill irrevocably split the Whig Party, one of the two major political parties in the country at the time. Every northern Whig had opposed the bill; almost every southern Whig voted for it. With the emotional issue of slavery involved, there was no way a common ground could be found. Most of the southern Whigs soon were swept into the Democratic Party. Northern Whigs reorganized themselves with other non-slavery interests to become the REPUBLICAN PARTY, the party of Abraham Lincoln. This left the Democratic Party as the sole remaining institution that crossed sectional lines. Animosity between the North and South was again on the rise. The North felt that if the Compromise of 1820 was ignored, the Compromise of 1850 could be ignored as well. Violations of the hated Fugitive Slave Law increased. Trouble was indeed back with a vengeance.

'''

===== 堪萨斯州的分裂 (反对奴隶制者, 与支持蓄奴者之间的分裂)

The passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act would lead to a civil war between pro-slavery and anti-slavery settlers in Kansas.

Slavery was quite likely to be outlawed in Nebraska, where cotton doesn't grow well. The situation in Kansas was entirely different, where the land was similar to Missouri's, which was a slave state. Kansas was to be governed by the principle of popular sovereignty. Whether Kansas was to be slave or free would be decided at the polls. Both free and slave forces were determined to hold sway.

Missouri counties that bordered Kansas were strongly pro-slavery and wanted their neighbor to be a slave state. In the fall of 1854, SENATOR DAVID ATCHISON of Missouri led over 1,700 men from Missouri into Kansas to vote for their pro-slavery representative. These were the infamous "BORDER RUFFIANS," who threatened to shoot, burn and hang those opposed to slavery.

Although their votes were later ruled fraudulent, their candidate was elected to Congress. When it came time to elect a territorial legislature the following March, almost 5,000 men came into the state from Missouri to cast illegal ballots. Pro-slavery forces had the numbers, not the ethics, on their side. Anti-slavery settlers, though the majority in Kansas, were outvoted. The result of the election through fraud was a legislature with 36 pro-slavery delegates and 3 anti-slavery delegates.


As one of their first acts, this legislature passed a harsh slave code that provided fines and imprisonment simply for expressing opinions against slavery. The death penalty would be administered to any individual found guilty of assisting slaves to revolt or escape. It also legalized the "border ruffian" vote by not requiring voters to be residents in Kansas prior to voting and made the law retroactive to the preceding elections.

Within a year, the population of anti-slavery residents in Kansas far outnumbered legal residents of Kansas who were pro-slavery. They were not prepared to obey the laws of the "BOGUS LEGISLATURE," seated in SHAWNEE MISSION. Organized under the name of FREE SOILERS, they drew up a free state constitution and elected a separate governor and state legislature located in Topeka. The result was a state with two governments. Violence would soon follow.

===== 德雷德·斯科特案 (到过自由州的奴隶, 是否能自动获得自由身?)

Between 1856 and 1860, America would see a breakdown in many of its political processes that had developed over the last eight decades. The GREAT COMPROMISERS of the early 19th century — Daniel Webster, Henry Clay and John Calhoun — were gone, and their leadership in avoiding disunion were gone as well. Forces on the extremes were becoming more and more powerful, reducing the influence of moderates and crippling the spirit of reconciliation. Front and center was the issue of slavery. Could the country be saved, or was it on an irrevocable path toward disunion?

The Congress and the Presidents of the past decade had failed to resolve the burning issue of slavery in the territories. Could the Supreme Court, the highest law in the land, put the issue to rest? Politicians and the American public hoped it could determine some long term framework for settlement of the slavery issue. An opportunity was presented when the Dred Scott case reached the High Court. As a slave having lived in a free territory, was he now free when he returned to a slave state? No. And more — neither a state nor Congress had the right to outlaw slavery.


From the 1780s, the question of whether slavery would be permitted in new territories had threatened the Union. Over the decades, many compromises had been made to avoid disunion. But what did the Constitution say on this subject? This question was raised in 1857 before the Supreme Court in case of DRED SCOTT VS. SANDFORD. DRED SCOTT was a slave of an army surgeon, John Emerson. Scott had been taken from Missouri to posts in Illinois and what is now Minnesota for several years in the 1830s, before returning to Missouri. The Missouri Compromise of 1820 had declared the area including MINNESOTA free. In 1846, Scott sued for his freedom on the grounds that he had lived in a free state and a free territory for a prolonged period of time. Finally, after eleven years, his case reached the Supreme Court. At stake were answers to critical questions, including slavery in the territories and citizenship of African-Americans. The verdict was a bombshell.

The Court ruled that Scott's "sojourn" of two years to Illinois and the Northwest Territory did not make him free once he returned to Missouri.

The Court further ruled that as a black man Scott was excluded from United States citizenship and could not, therefore, bring suit. According to the opinion of the Court, African-Americans had not been part of the "SOVEREIGN PEOPLE" who made the Constitution.

The Court also ruled that Congress never had the right to prohibit slavery in any territory. Any ban on slavery was a violation of the Fifth Amendment, which prohibited denying property rights without due process of law.

The Missouri Compromise was therefore unconstitutional.



The Chief Justice of the United States was ROGER B. TANEY, a former slave owner, as were four other southern justices on the Court. The two dissenting justices of the nine-member Court were the only Republicans. The north refused to accept a decision by a Court they felt was dominated by "Southern fire-eaters." Many Northerners, including Abraham Lincoln, felt that the next step would be for the Supreme Court to decide that no state could exclude slavery under the Constitution, regardless of their wishes or their laws.


Two of the three branches of government, the Congress and the President, had failed to resolve the issue. Now the Supreme Court rendered a decision that was only accepted in the southern half of the country. Was the American experiment collapsing? The only remaining national political institution with both northern and southern strength was the Democratic Party, and it was now splitting at the seams. The fate of the Union looked hopeless.

===  The Lincoln-Douglas Debates

In 1858, as the country moved ever closer to disunion, two politicians from Illinois attracted the attention of a nation. From August 21 until October 15, Stephen Douglas battled Abraham Lincoln in face to face DEBATES around the state. The prize they sought was a seat in the Senate. Lincoln challenged Douglas to a war of ideas. Douglas took the challenge. The debates were to be held at 7 locations throughout Illinois. The fight was on and the nation was watching.

The nomination of candidates and the election of the President in 1860 were among the most divisive events in the history of this nation. ABRAHAM LINCOLN was President, and within weeks, 7 states left the Union to form the CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA.

The Democrats met in Charleston, South Carolina, in April 1860 to select their candidate for President in the upcoming election. It was turmoil. Northern democrats felt that Stephen Douglas had the best chance to defeat the "BLACK REPUBLICANS." Although an ardent supporter of slavery, southern Democrats considered Douglas a traitor because of his support of popular sovereignty, permitting territories to choose not to have slavery. Southern democrats stormed out of the convention, without choosing a candidate. Six weeks later, the northern Democrats chose Douglas, while at a separate convention the Southern Democrats nominated then VICE-PRESIDENT JOHN C. BRECKENRIDGE.

The Republicans met in Chicago that May and recognized that the Democrat's turmoil actually gave them a chance to take the election. They needed to select a candidate who could carry the North and win a majority of the Electoral College. To do that, the Republicans needed someone who could carry New Jersey, Illinois, Indiana and Pennsylvania — four important states that remained uncertain. There were plenty of potential candidates, but in the end Abraham Lincoln had emerged as the best choice. Lincoln had become the symbol of the frontier, hard work, the self-made man and the American dream. His debates with Douglas had made him a national figure and the publication of those debates in early 1860 made him even better known. After the third ballot, he had the nomination for President.

A number of aging politicians and distinguished citizens, calling themselves the CONSTITUTIONAL UNION PARTY, nominated JOHN BELL of Tennessee, a wealthy slaveholder as their candidate for President. These people were for moderation. They decided that the best way out of the present difficulties that faced the nation was to take no stand at all on the issues that divided the north and the south.


The votes of the Electoral College were split among four candidates in the 1860 presidential election. The states that Lincoln won are shown in red, Breckenridge in green, Bell in orange and Douglas in brown.


With four candidates in the field, Lincoln received only 40% of the popular vote and 180 electoral votes — enough to narrowly win the crowded election. This meant that 60% of the voters selected someone other than Lincoln. With the results tallied, the question was, would the South accept the outcome? A few weeks after the election, South Carolina seceded from the Union.

=== 南方脱离联邦, 及北方最后的挽救

The force of events moved very quickly upon the election of Lincoln. South Carolina acted first, calling for a convention to SECEDE from the Union. State by state, conventions were held, and the CONFEDERACY was formed.


Within a few days, the two United States Senators from South Carolina submitted their resignations. On December 20, 1860, by a vote of 169-0, the South Carolina legislature enacted an "ordinance" that "the union now subsisting between South Carolina and other States, under the name of 'The United States of America,' is hereby dissolved." As GIST had hoped, South Carolina's action resulted in conventions in other southern states. Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas all left the Union by February 1. On February 4, delegates from all these states except Texas met in Montgomery, Alabama, to create and staff a government called the Confederate States of America. They elected PRESIDENT JEFFERSON DAVIS. The gauntlet was thrown. How would the North respond?



A few last ditch efforts were made to end the crisis through Constitutional amendment. SENATOR JOHN JORDAN CRITTENDEN proposed to amend the Constitution to extend the old 36°30' line to the Pacific. All territory North of the line would be forever free, and all territory south of the line would receive federal protection for slavery. Republicans refused to support this measure.
