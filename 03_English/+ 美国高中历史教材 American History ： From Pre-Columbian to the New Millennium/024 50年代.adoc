== 解说

===  The 1950s: Happy Days  / 20世纪50年代：快乐的日子

Of course, not everything was as rosy as it seemed. +
Beneath the pristine exterior, a small group of critics and nonconformists pointed out the flaws in a suburbia they believed had no soul, a government they believed was growing dangerously powerful, and a lifestyle they believed was fundamentally repressed. +
And much of America was still segregated.

[.my2]
当然，并非一切都像看起来那么美好。在原始的外表下，一小群批评家和不墨守成规的人指出了他们认为郊区没有灵魂的缺陷，他们认为政府正在变得危险的强大，他们认为生活方式从根本上受到压制。美国大部分地区仍然处于种族隔离状态。

Nevertheless, the notion of the 1950s as happy days lived on. +
Perhaps when measured against the Great Depression of the 1930s, the world war of the 1940s, the strife of the 1960s, and the malaise of the 1970s, the 1950s were indeed fabulous.

[.my2]
尽管如此，20 世纪 50 年代的快乐时光依然存在。或许，*与20世纪30年代的大萧条、1940年代的世界大战、1960年代的冲突, 和1970年代的萎靡相比，1950年代确实是神话般的。*

==== McCarthyism 麦卡锡主义

1952 Republican Convention +
"Our job as Americans and as Republicans is to dislodge the traitors from every place where they've been sent to do their traitorous work." -Joseph McCarthy, speech before the Republican National Convention (1952)

[.my2]
“作为美国人和共和党人，我们的工作就是将叛徒赶出他们被派去从事叛国工作的每一个地方。” ——约瑟夫·麦卡锡，共和党全国代表大会前的演讲（1952 年）

"Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the Communist party?"

[.my2]
“你现在或者曾经是一名共产党员吗？”

In the 1950s, thousands of Americans who toiled in the government, served in the army, worked in the movie industry, or came from various walks of life had to answer that question before a congressional panel.

[.my2]
在 20 世纪 50 年代，成千上万在政府工作、在军队服役、在电影行业工作, 或来自各行各业的美国人, 必须在国会小组面前回答这个问题。

SENATOR JOSEPH MCCARTHY rose to national prominence by initiating a probe to ferret out communists holding prominent positions. +
During his investigations, safeguards promised by the Constitution were trampled.

[.my2]
**参议员约瑟夫·麦卡锡通过发起一项调查，找出担任要职的共产党人，从而在全国声名鹊起。**在他的调查过程中，*宪法承诺的保障措施, 被践踏。*

Why were so many held in thrall to the Wisconsin lawmaker? Why was an environment that some likened to the SALEM WITCH TRIALS tolerated?

[.my2]
为什么这么多人受威斯康星州立法者的奴役？为什么有人会容忍类似塞勒姆女巫审判的环境？


Fears that children would be corrupted by the "communist" practices depicted in Robin Hood led many schools and libraries to ban the classic tale about taking from the rich to give to the poor.

[.my2]
由于担心孩子们会被《罗宾汉》中描述的“共产主义”做法所腐蚀，许多学校和图书馆禁止阅读这个关于从富人那里夺取穷人的财富的经典故事。

The Atomic Era 原子时代

In 1947, President Truman had ordered background checks of every civilian in service to the government. +
When Alger Hiss, a high-ranking State Department official was convicted on espionage charges, fear of communists intensified.

[.my2]
**1947 年，杜鲁门总统下令对每一位为政府服务的平民, 进行背景调查。**当国务院高级官员阿尔杰·希斯因"间谍罪"被定罪时，人们对共产党的恐惧加剧了。

McCarthy capitalized on national paranoia by proclaiming that COMMUNIST SPIES were omnipresent and that he was America's only salvation.

[.my2]
**麦卡锡利用全国性的偏执，宣称"共产主义间谍"无处不在，**他是美国唯一的拯救者。

An atmosphere of fear of world domination by communists hung over America in the postwar years. +
There were fears of a nuclear holocaust based on the knowledge that the Soviet Union exploded its first A-bomb in 1949. +
That same year, China, the world's most populous nation, became communist. +
Half of Europe was under Joseph Stalin's influence, and every time Americans read their newspapers there seemed to be a new atomic threat.

[.my2]
战后的岁月里，美国笼罩着一种对"共产主义统治世界"的恐惧气氛。由于苏联在 1949 年爆炸了第一颗原子弹，人们担心会发生"核浩劫"。同年，世界上人口最多的国家中国, 成为共产主义国家。半个欧洲都处于约瑟夫·斯大林的影响之下，每次美国人读报纸时，似乎都会出现新的原子威胁。


At a speech in WHEELING, WEST VIRGINIA, on February 9, 1950, McCarthy launched his first salvo. +
He proclaimed that he was aware of 205 card-carrying members of the Communist Party who worked for the United States Department of State. +
A few days later, he repeated the charges at a speech in Salt Lake City. +
McCarthy soon began to attract headlines, and the Senate asked him to make his case.

[.my2]
1950 年 2 月 9 日，麦卡锡在西弗吉尼亚州惠灵市的一次演讲中, 发起了他的第一次齐射。他宣称, 他知道有 205 名在美国国务院工作的共产党员。几天后，他在盐湖城的一次演讲中重申了这些指控。麦卡锡很快就开始成为头条新闻，参议院要求他阐述自己的观点。

On February 20, 1950, McCarthy addressed the Senate and made a list of dubious claims against suspected communists. +
He cited 81 cases that day. +
He skipped several numbers, and for some cases repeated the same flimsy information. +
He proved nothing, but the Senate called for a full investigation. +
McCarthy was in the national spotlight.

[.my2]
1950 年 2 月 20 日，麦卡锡在参议院发表讲话，列出了一系列针对共产党嫌疑人的可疑指控。当天他列举了81个案例。他跳过了几个数字，并且在某些情况下重复了同样脆弱的信息。他没有证明什么，但参议院要求进行全面调查。麦卡锡成为全国关注的焦点。

Staying in the headlines was a full-time job. +
After accusing low-level officials, McCarthy went for the big guns, even questioning the loyalty of DEAN ACHESON and George Marshall. +
Some Republicans in the Senate were aghast and disavowed McCarthy.

[.my2]
成为头条新闻是一项全职工作。在指责低层官员后，麦卡锡开始大肆宣扬，甚至质疑迪恩·艾奇逊和乔治·马歇尔的忠诚度。参议院的一些共和党人感到震惊, 并否认了麦卡锡的观点。

Others such as ROBERT TAFT and Richard Nixon, saw him as an asset. +
The public rewarded the witch-hunters by sending red-baiters (communist accusers) before the Senate and the House in 1950.

[.my2]
其他人，如罗伯特·塔夫脱和理查德·尼克松，则将他视为一笔财富。 1950 年，公众通过向参议院和众议院派出红色诱饵（共产主义指控者）来奖励政治迫害者。

"Tail Gunner Joe" Shot Down

[.my2]
“尾枪手乔”被击落


When Dwight Eisenhower became president, he had no love for McCarthy. +
Ike was reluctant to condemn McCarthy for fear of splitting the Republican Party. +
McCarthy's accusations went on into 1954, when the Wisconsin senator focused on the United States Army. +
For eight weeks, in televised hearings, McCarthy interrogated army officials, including many decorated war heroes.

[.my2]
当德怀特·艾森豪威尔就任总统时，他对麦卡锡没有任何感情。艾克不愿谴责麦卡锡，因为担心分裂共和党。麦卡锡的指控一直持续到 1954 年，当时这位威斯康星州参议员, 将矛头指向了美国陆军。在八周的时间里，麦卡锡在电视听证会上审问了军队官员，其中包括许多荣获勋章的战争英雄。

But this was his tragic mistake. +
Television illustrated the mean-spiritedness of McCarthy's campaign. +
The army then went on the attack, questioning McCarthy's methods and credibility. +
In one memorable fusillade, the Council for the Army simply asked McCarthy, "At long last, have you no sense of decency left?"

[.my2]
但这是他的悲剧性错误。电视展现了麦卡锡竞选活动的卑鄙。军队随后发起攻击，质疑麦卡锡的方法和可信度。在一次令人难忘的连击中，陆军委员会简单地问麦卡锡：“你终于没有正派观念了吗？”

Poll after poll showed the American people thought McCarthy unscrupulous in his attack of the army.

[.my2]
一次又一次的民意调查显示，美国民众认为麦卡锡对军队的攻击是不择手段的。

Fed up, McCarthy's colleagues censured him for dishonoring the Senate, and the hearings came to a close. +
Plagued with poor health and alcoholism, McCarthy himself died three years later.

[.my2]
麦卡锡的同事们厌倦了，谴责他羞辱了参议院，听证会结束了。由于健康状况不佳和酗酒，麦卡锡本人在三年后去世。


[.my1]
.案例
====
.McCarthyism 麦卡锡主义

广义上是**指用大规模的宣传, 和不加以区分的指责，特别是没有足够证据的指控，造成对人格和名誉的诽谤。**

另外，这个词语在英语里的定义, 也延伸到“*用不充分的证据, 公开指责对方政治上的不忠或颠覆，或者是用不公平的调查或指责, 来打压反对人士*”。

麦卡锡主义也是"猎巫"、"集体发疯"和"道德恐慌"的同义词。

这个词语源自于1950年代以美国共和党参议员约瑟夫·雷蒙德·麦卡锡为代表的一种政治态度。麦卡锡认为共产党渗透了美国政府的一些部门以及其他机构。为了阻止国家被颠覆，他用大规模的宣传和不加以区分的指责，制造了一系列的调查和听证去曝光这些渗透。**被怀疑的主要对象是政府雇员、好莱坞娱乐界从业人士、教育界、工会成员。**

*而从1950年代中期起，麦卡锡主义逐渐衰败，主要原因包括公众支持度的下降、麦卡锡本人在1957年逝世、以及第14任美国首席大法官厄尔·沃伦领导的美国最高法院的反对。* 其中，沃伦法院作出的一系列重要判决, 协助终结了麦卡锡主义。
====

McCarthy was not the only individual to seek out potential communists.

[.my2]
麦卡锡并不是唯一一个寻找潜在共产主义者的人。

The HOUSE COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES (HUAC) targeted the Hollywood film industry. +
Actors, writers, and producers alike were summoned to appear before the committee and provide names of colleagues who may have been members of the Communist Party.

[.my2]
众议院非美活动委员会（HUAC）瞄准了好莱坞电影业。演员、作家和制片人, 都被传唤到委员会面前，并提供可能是共产党员的同事的姓名。

Those who repented and named names of suspected communists were allowed to return to business as usual. +
Those who refused to address the committee were cited for contempt. +
Uncooperative artists were blacklisted from jobs in the entertainment industry. +
Years passed until many had their reputations restored.

[.my2]
那些悔改, 并点名涉嫌共产主义者的人, 被允许恢复正常工作。那些拒绝向委员会发表讲话的人, 则被指控藐视法庭。不合作的艺术家, 被列入娱乐行业工作黑名单。多年过去后，许多人才恢复了名誉。


Were there in fact communists in America?

[.my2]
美国实际上有共产主义者吗？

The answer is undoubtedly yes. +
But many of the accused had attended party rallies 15 or more years before the hearings — it had been fashionable to do so in the 1930s.

[.my2]
答案无疑是肯定的。但许多被告在听证会前 15 年或更长时间, 就参加过政党集会——这种做法在 20 世纪 30 年代很流行。

Although the Soviet spy ring did penetrate the highest levels of the American government, the vast majority of the accused were innocent victims. +
All across America, state legislatures and school boards mimicked McCarthy and HUAC. +
Thousands of people lost their jobs and had their reputations tarnished.

[.my2]
尽管苏联间谍网确实渗透到了美国政府最高层，但绝大多数被告都是无辜的受害者。在美国各地，州立法机构和学校董事会, 都效仿麦卡锡和 HUAC。成千上万的人失去了工作，名誉也受损。

Other Witch-Hunt Victims

[.my2]
其他政治迫害受害者

Unions were special target of communist hunters. +
Sensing an unfavorable environment, the AFL (AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR) and the CIO (CONGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS) merged in 1955 to close ranks. +
Books were pulled from library shelves, including Robin Hood, which was deemed communist-like for suggesting stealing from the rich to give to the poor.

[.my2]
**工会是共产主义猎手的特殊目标。**察觉到不利的环境，AFL（美国劳工联合会）和 CIO（工业组织大会）于 1955 年合并，关系更加紧密。图书馆书架上的书籍被撤下，其中包括《罗宾汉》，该书因建议从富人那里偷窃送给穷人, 而被视为共产主义。

No politician could consider opening trade with China or withdrawing from Southeast Asia without being branded a communist. +
Although McCarthyism was dead by the mid-1950s, its effects lasted for decades.

[.my2]
任何政客在考虑与中国开放贸易, 或从东南亚撤军时, 都会被贴上"共产主义者"的标签。尽管麦卡锡主义在 20 世纪 50 年代中期已经消亡，但其影响却持续了数十年。

Above all, several messages became crystal clear to the average American: Don't criticize the United States. +
Don't be different. +
Just conform.

[.my2]
最重要的是，有几个信息对普通美国人来说变得非常清楚：不要批评美国。别与众不同。顺应就好。

'''

==== Suburban Growth 郊区增长

POSTWAR AFFLUENCE redefined the American Dream. +
Gone was the poverty borne of the Great Depression, and the years of wartime sacrifice were over.

多年来一直推迟生育孩子的家庭不再等待，整个国家迎来了战后的婴儿潮。

acial fears, affordable housing, and the desire to leave decaying cities were all factors that prompted many white Americans to flee to SUBURBIA.

[.my2]
种族恐惧、经济适用房, 以及离开衰败城市的愿望, 都是促使许多美国白人逃往郊区的因素。

==== The Cold War Continues 冷战仍在继续


The end of the Korean War in 1953 by no means brought an end to global hostilities.

[.my2]
1953 年朝鲜战争的结束, 并没有结束全球的敌对行动。

As the British and French Empires slowly yielded to independence movements, a new Third World emerged. +
This became the major battleground of the Cold War as the United States and the Soviet Union struggled to bring new nations into their respective orbits. +
Across the Third World, the two superpowers squared off through proxy armies.

[.my2]
随着英帝国和法兰西帝国慢慢屈服于独立运动，一个新的第三世界出现了。随着美国和苏联努力将新国家纳入各自的轨道，这里成为冷战的主要战场。在第三世界，两个超级大国通过"代理人"军队, 展开对峙。

The United States's recognition of Israel in 1948 created a strong new ally, but created many enemies. +
Arab nations, enraged by American support for the new Jewish state, found supportive ears in the Soviet Union.

[.my2]
美国1948年承认以色列，创造了一个强大的新盟友，但也树下了许多敌人。阿拉伯国家对美国对新犹太国家的支持感到愤怒，并在苏联找到了支持。

When Egyptian President GAMAL ABDEL NASSER sought to strengthen ties with the Soviet bloc, the United States withdrew its pledge to help Nasser construct the all-important ASWAN DAM. +
Nasser responded by nationalizing the SUEZ CANAL, an action that compelled British, French, and Israeli armies to invade Egypt.

[.my2]
当埃及总统加迈勒·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔, 寻求加强与苏联集团的关系时，美国撤回了帮助纳赛尔建设至关重要的阿斯旺大坝的承诺。纳赛尔的回应是将"苏伊士运河"国有化，这一行动迫使英国、法国和以色列军队, 入侵埃及。


Egyptian president Gamal Abder Nasser's 1956 nationalization of the Suez Canal, crippled the ability of Great Britain and France to trade internationally. +
As a result, the two countries allied with Israel to attack Egypt.

[.my2]
埃及总统贾迈勒·阿卜杜尔·纳赛尔 1956 年将苏伊士运河国有化，削弱了英国和法国的国际贸易能力。于是，两国联合以色列, 进攻埃及。

The Eisenhower Doctrine

[.my2]
艾森豪威尔主义

The Western alliance was threatened as President Dwight Eisenhower called upon Britain and France to show restraint. +
With Soviet influence growing in the oil-rich region, Ike issued the Eisenhower Doctrine, which pledged American support to any governments fighting communist insurgencies in the Middle East. +
Making good on that promise, he sent over 5,000 marines to LEBANON to forestall an anti-Western takeover.

[.my2]
德怀特·艾森豪威尔总统, 呼吁英国和法国表现出克制，西方联盟受到威胁。随着苏联在石油资源丰富地区的影响力不断增强，艾克发布了《艾森豪威尔主义》，承诺美国支持任何政府打击中东的"共产主义"叛乱。他兑现了这一承诺，派遣了 5,000 多名海军陆战队员前往黎巴嫩，以阻止反西方的接管。

[.my1]
.案例

[.my2]
在南方，共产主义革命家胡志明, 成功击败了法国殖民军，创建了新的越南国家。*美国对"遏制共产主义"的承诺, 导致了一场旷日持久的卷入，最终演变成了"越南战争"。*


The CIA

[.my2]
中央情报局

In the aftermath of World War II, the United States created a new weapon to assist in fighting the Cold War: the CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY. +
In addition to gathering information on Soviet plans and maneuvers, the CIA also involved itself in covert operations designed to prevent communist dictators from rising to power.

[.my2]
二战结束后，美国创造了一种协助对抗冷战的新武器：中央情报局。*除了收集有关苏联计划和演习的信息外，"中央情报局"还参与旨在"防止共产主义独裁者上台"的秘密行动。*

The first such instance occurred in Iran, when Iranian Prime Minister MOHAMMED MOSSADEGH nationalized BRITISH PETROLEUM. +
Fearing Soviet influence in the powerful oil nation, the CIA recruited a phony mob to drive off Mossadegh and return the American-backed SHAH MOHAMMAD REZA PAHLAVI to power.

[.my2]
第一个这样的例子发生在伊朗，当时伊朗总理穆罕默德·摩萨德将英国石油公司国有化。由于担心苏联对这个强大的石油国家的影响，中央情报局招募了一群虚假的暴民, 来赶走摩萨台，并让美国支持的沙阿·穆罕默德·礼萨·巴列维重新掌权。

When JACOBO ARBENZ came to power in Guatemala, he promised to relieve the nation's impoverished farmers by seizing land held by the American-owned UNITED FRUIT COMPANY and redistributing it to the peasants. +

Fidel Castro capitalized on this sentiment by overthrowing U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista from power in Cuba in January 1959.

[.my2]
在整个拉丁美洲，美国被视为残暴独裁者的残酷捍卫者，牺牲了民选领导人的利益。菲德尔·卡斯特罗 (Fidel Castro) 利用这种情绪，于 1959 年 1 月推翻了美国支持的古巴独裁者富尔亨西奥·巴蒂斯塔 (Fulgencio Batista)。

Policy of Mass Retaliation

[.my2]
大规模报复政策

Relations remained icy between the United States and the Soviet Union. +
Relying on the knowledge that the United States had a much larger nuclear arsenal than the Soviet Union, Eisenhower and Dulles announced a policy of massive retaliation. +
Any attack by the Soviets on the United States or its allies would be met with nuclear force.

[.my2]
美国和苏联之间的关系仍然冰冷。艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯基于美国拥有比苏联大得多的核武库的知识，宣布了大规模报复政策。苏联对美国或其盟国的任何攻击, 都将遭到核武力的反击。

The Soviet crackdown on the HUNGARIAN UPRISING OF 1956 further strained relations. +
In an effort to reduce tensions, Eisenhower offered an "OPEN SKIES" PROPOSAL to Soviet leader NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV. +
Planes from each nation would be permitted to fly over the other to inspect nuclear sites. +
But Khrushchev declined the offer. +
A summit conference between Eisenhower and Khrushchev was canceled in 1960 when the Soviets shot down an American U-2 SPY PLANE piloted by GARY POWERS.

[.my2]
1956 年苏联对匈牙利起义的镇压, 进一步加剧了两国关系的紧张。为了缓解紧张局势，艾森豪威尔向苏联领导人尼基塔·赫鲁晓夫提出了“开放天空”提案。两国的飞机将被允许飞越对方上空检查核设施。但赫鲁晓夫拒绝了这一提议。 1960 年，由于苏联击落了一架由加里·鲍尔斯 (GARY POWERS) 驾驶的美国 U-2 间谍飞机，艾森豪威尔和赫鲁晓夫之间的峰会被取消。

==== McCarthyism

1952 Republican Convention +
"Our job as Americans and as Republicans is to dislodge the traitors from every place where they've been sent to do their traitorous work." -Joseph McCarthy, speech before the Republican National Convention (1952)

"Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the Communist party?"

In the 1950s, thousands of Americans who toiled in the government, served in the army, worked in the movie industry, or came from various walks of life had to answer that question before a congressional panel.

SENATOR JOSEPH MCCARTHY rose to national prominence by initiating a probe to ferret out communists holding prominent positions. During his investigations, safeguards promised by the Constitution were trampled.

Why were so many held in thrall to the Wisconsin lawmaker? Why was an environment that some likened to the SALEM WITCH TRIALS tolerated?


Fears that children would be corrupted by the "communist" practices depicted in Robin Hood led many schools and libraries to ban the classic tale about taking from the rich to give to the poor.

The Atomic Era

In 1947, President Truman had ordered background checks of every civilian in service to the government. When Alger Hiss, a high-ranking State Department official was convicted on espionage charges, fear of communists intensified.

McCarthy capitalized on national paranoia by proclaiming that COMMUNIST SPIES were omnipresent and that he was America's only salvation.

An atmosphere of fear of world domination by communists hung over America in the postwar years. There were fears of a nuclear holocaust based on the knowledge that the Soviet Union exploded its first A-bomb in 1949. That same year, China, the world's most populous nation, became communist. Half of Europe was under Joseph Stalin's influence, and every time Americans read their newspapers there seemed to be a new atomic threat.


At a speech in WHEELING, WEST VIRGINIA, on February 9, 1950, McCarthy launched his first salvo. He proclaimed that he was aware of 205 card-carrying members of the Communist Party who worked for the United States Department of State. A few days later, he repeated the charges at a speech in Salt Lake City. McCarthy soon began to attract headlines, and the Senate asked him to make his case.

Poll after poll showed the American people thought McCarthy unscrupulous in his attack of the army.

Fed up, McCarthy's colleagues censured him for dishonoring the Senate, and the hearings came to a close. Plagued with poor health and alcoholism, McCarthy himself died three years later.



McCarthy was not the only individual to seek out potential communists.

The HOUSE COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES (HUAC) targeted the Hollywood film industry. Actors, writers, and producers alike were summoned to appear before the committee and provide names of colleagues who may have been members of the Communist Party.

Those who repented and named names of suspected communists were allowed to return to business as usual. Those who refused to address the committee were cited for contempt.

When JACOBO ARBENZ came to power in Guatemala, he promised to relieve the nation's impoverished farmers by seizing land held by the American-owned UNITED FRUIT COMPANY and redistributing it to the peasants. With the support of American air power, a CIA-backed band of mercenaries overthrew Arbenz and established a military dictatorship.



Throughout Latin America, the United States was seen as a brutal defender of thuggish autocrats at the expense of popularly elected leaders. Fidel Castro capitalized on this sentiment by overthrowing U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista from power in Cuba in January 1959.

Policy of Mass Retaliation

Relations remained icy between the United States and the Soviet Union. Relying on the knowledge that the United States had a much larger nuclear arsenal than the Soviet Union, Eisenhower and Dulles announced a policy of massive retaliation. Any attack by the Soviets on the United States or its allies would be met with nuclear force.

The Soviet crackdown on the HUNGARIAN UPRISING OF 1956 further strained relations. In an effort to reduce tensions, Eisenhower offered an "OPEN SKIES" PROPOSAL to Soviet leader NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV. Planes from each nation would be permitted to fly over the other to inspect nuclear sites. But Khrushchev declined the offer. A summit conference between Eisenhower and Khrushchev was canceled in 1960 when the Soviets shot down an American U-2 SPY PLANE piloted by GARY POWERS.
