== 解说

===  The 1950s: Happy Days  / 20世纪50年代：快乐的日子

Of course, not everything was as rosy (a.)粉红色的；红润的;美好的；乐观的 as it seemed. +

Beneath the pristine (a.)崭新的；清新的;未开发的；处于原始状态的 exterior （尤指建筑物的）外部，外观，表面，外貌, a small group of critics and nonconformists (n.)不从国教者；不遵循传统规范的人；不认同主流思想的人 *pointed out* _the flaws_ in a suburbia  郊区；郊区居民 they believed had no soul, _a government_ they believed was growing dangerously powerful, and _a lifestyle_ they believed was fundamentally repressed (v.)压制；镇压. +

And much of America was still segregated (v.)隔离并区别对待（不同种族、宗教或性别的人）;（使）分开，分离，隔离.

[.my2]
当然，并非一切都像看起来那么美好。在原始的外表下，一小群批评家和不墨守成规的人指出了他们认为郊区没有灵魂的缺陷，他们认为政府正在变得危险的强大，他们认为生活方式从根本上受到压制。美国大部分地区仍然处于种族隔离状态。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.pris·tine
(a.) fresh and clean, as if new 崭新的；清新的 +
- The car is in pristine condition . 这辆汽车是全新的。
====

Nevertheless 尽管如此；不过；然而, `主` the notion 观念；信念；理解 of the 1950s *as* happy days `谓` lived (v.) on. +
Perhaps when *measured (v.)使相比较 against* the Great Depression of the 1930s, the world war of the 1940s, the strife 冲突；争斗；倾轧 of the 1960s, and the malaise （广泛存在的）难以捉摸的问题，无法描述的问题;莫名的不适（或不快、不满等） of the 1970s, the 1950s were indeed fabulous (a.)极好的；绝妙的;寓言中的；神话似的.

[.my2]
尽管如此，20 世纪 50 年代的快乐时光依然存在。或许，*与20世纪30年代的大萧条、1940年代的世界大战、1960年代的冲突, 和1970年代的萎靡相比，1950年代确实是神话般的。*

[.my1]
.案例
====
.mal·aise
(n.)the problems affecting a particular situation or group of people that are difficult to explain or identify （广泛存在的）难以捉摸的问题，无法描述的问题  +
• economic/financial/social malaise 揣摩不透的经济╱金融╱社会问题

-> 前缀mal-常表示负面含义，来自拉丁语malus“坏的”，所以我直接归为否定前缀，如malady（疾病），malaria（疟疾）；词根aise和单词ease（安逸）同源，来自同一个古法语单词；它的字面义为“不安逸，不舒服”，所以表“身体不适”。

==== McCarthyism 麦卡锡主义

其主动形式是：Why *did* someone *tolerate* (v.) an environment that some likened (v.) to the SALEM WITCH TRIALS?

在这两个句子中，"被动语态"的使用, 突出强调了"受动者"（许多人和环境），而不是"施动者"（谁使许多人迷住或谁容忍了这种环境）。

.McCarthyism 麦卡锡主义

Joseph McCarthy +

image:/img/Joseph McCarthy.jpg[,30%]


广义上是**指用大规模的宣传, 和不加以区分的指责，特别是没有足够证据的指控，造成对人格和名誉的诽谤。**

另外，这个词语在英语里的定义, 也延伸到“*用不充分的证据, 公开指责对方政治上的不忠或颠覆，或者是用不公平的调查或指责, 来打压反对人士*”。

麦卡锡主义也是"猎巫"、"集体发疯"和"道德恐慌"的同义词。

这个词语源自于1950年代以美国共和党参议员约瑟夫·雷蒙德·麦卡锡为代表的一种政治态度。麦卡锡认为共产党渗透了美国政府的一些部门以及其他机构。为了阻止国家被颠覆，他用大规模的宣传和不加以区分的指责，制造了一系列的调查和听证去曝光这些渗透。**被怀疑的主要对象是政府雇员、好莱坞娱乐界从业人士、教育界、工会成员。**

*而从1950年代中期起，麦卡锡主义逐渐衰败，主要原因包括公众支持度的下降、麦卡锡本人在1957年逝世、以及第14任美国首席大法官厄尔·沃伦领导的美国最高法院的反对。* 其中，沃伦法院作出的一系列重要判决, 协助终结了麦卡锡主义。

Were there in fact communists in America?

[.my2]
美国实际上有共产主义者吗？

The answer is undoubtedly yes. +
But many of the accused had attended party rallies 15 or more years before the hearings — it had been fashionable to do so in the 1930s.

[.my2]
答案无疑是肯定的。但许多被告在听证会前 15 年或更长时间, 就参加过政党集会——这种做法在 20 世纪 30 年代很流行。

Although the Soviet spy ring did penetrate the highest levels of the American government, the vast majority of the accused were innocent victims. +
All across America, state legislatures and school boards mimicked McCarthy and HUAC. +
Thousands of people lost their jobs and had their reputations tarnished.

[.my2]
尽管苏联间谍网确实渗透到了美国政府最高层，但绝大多数被告都是无辜的受害者。在美国各地，州立法机构和学校董事会, 都效仿麦卡锡和 HUAC。成千上万的人失去了工作，名誉也受损。

[.my2]
**工会是共产主义猎手的特殊目标。**察觉到不利的环境，AFL（美国劳工联合会）和 CIO（工业组织大会）于 1955 年合并，关系更加紧密。图书馆书架上的书籍被撤下，其中包括《罗宾汉》，该书因建议从富人那里偷窃送给穷人, 而被视为共产主义。

No politician could consider opening trade with China or withdrawing from Southeast Asia without being branded a communist. +
Although McCarthyism was dead by the mid-1950s, its effects lasted for decades.

[.my2]
任何政客在考虑与中国开放贸易, 或从东南亚撤军时, 都会被贴上"共产主义者"的标签。尽管麦卡锡主义在 20 世纪 50 年代中期已经消亡，但其影响却持续了数十年。

Don't be different. +
Just conform.

[.my2]
当埃及总统加迈勒·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔, 寻求加强与苏联集团的关系时，美国撤回了帮助纳赛尔建设至关重要的阿斯旺大坝的承诺。纳赛尔的回应是将"苏伊士运河"国有化，这一行动迫使英国、法国和以色列军队, 入侵埃及。

艾森豪威尔主义

The Western alliance was threatened as President Dwight Eisenhower called upon Britain and France to show restraint. +

Making good on that promise, he sent over 5,000 marines to LEBANON to forestall an anti-Western takeover.

[.my2]
德怀特·艾森豪威尔总统, 呼吁英国和法国表现出克制，西方联盟受到威胁。随着苏联在石油资源丰富地区的影响力不断增强，艾克发布了《艾森豪威尔主义》，承诺美国支持任何政府打击中东的"共产主义"叛乱。他兑现了这一承诺，派遣了 5,000 多名海军陆战队员前往黎巴嫩，以阻止反西方的接管。

===  The 1950s: Happy Days

Of course, not everything was as rosy as it seemed. Beneath the pristine exterior, a small group of critics and nonconformists pointed out the flaws in a suburbia they believed had no soul, a government they believed was growing dangerously powerful, and a lifestyle they believed was fundamentally repressed. And much of America was still segregated.

Nevertheless, the notion of the 1950s as happy days lived on. Perhaps when measured against the Great Depression of the 1930s, the world war of the 1940s, the strife of the 1960s, and the malaise of the 1970s, the 1950s were indeed fabulous.

==== McCarthyism

1952 Republican Convention +
"Our job as Americans and as Republicans is to dislodge the traitors from every place where they've been sent to do their traitorous work." -Joseph McCarthy, speech before the Republican National Convention (1952)

"Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the Communist party?"

In the 1950s, thousands of Americans who toiled in the government, served in the army, worked in the movie industry, or came from various walks of life had to answer that question before a congressional panel.

SENATOR JOSEPH MCCARTHY rose to national prominence by initiating a probe to ferret out communists holding prominent positions. During his investigations, safeguards promised by the Constitution were trampled.

Why were so many held in thrall to the Wisconsin lawmaker? Why was an environment that some likened to the SALEM WITCH TRIALS tolerated?


Fears that children would be corrupted by the "communist" practices depicted in Robin Hood led many schools and libraries to ban the classic tale about taking from the rich to give to the poor.

The Atomic Era

In 1947, President Truman had ordered background checks of every civilian in service to the government. When Alger Hiss, a high-ranking State Department official was convicted on espionage charges, fear of communists intensified.

McCarthy capitalized on national paranoia by proclaiming that COMMUNIST SPIES were omnipresent and that he was America's only salvation.

An atmosphere of fear of world domination by communists hung over America in the postwar years. There were fears of a nuclear holocaust based on the knowledge that the Soviet Union exploded its first A-bomb in 1949. That same year, China, the world's most populous nation, became communist. Half of Europe was under Joseph Stalin's influence, and every time Americans read their newspapers there seemed to be a new atomic threat.


At a speech in WHEELING, WEST VIRGINIA, on February 9, 1950, McCarthy launched his first salvo. He proclaimed that he was aware of 205 card-carrying members of the Communist Party who worked for the United States Department of State. A few days later, he repeated the charges at a speech in Salt Lake City. McCarthy soon began to attract headlines, and the Senate asked him to make his case.

On February 20, 1950, McCarthy addressed the Senate and made a list of dubious claims against suspected communists. He cited 81 cases that day. He skipped several numbers, and for some cases repeated the same flimsy information. He proved nothing, but the Senate called for a full investigation. McCarthy was in the national spotlight.

Staying in the headlines was a full-time job. After accusing low-level officials, McCarthy went for the big guns, even questioning the loyalty of DEAN ACHESON and George Marshall. Some Republicans in the Senate were aghast and disavowed McCarthy.

Others such as ROBERT TAFT and Richard Nixon, saw him as an asset. The public rewarded the witch-hunters by sending red-baiters (communist accusers) before the Senate and the House in 1950.



When Dwight Eisenhower became president, he had no love for McCarthy. Ike was reluctant to condemn McCarthy for fear of splitting the Republican Party. McCarthy's accusations went on into 1954, when the Wisconsin senator focused on the United States Army. For eight weeks, in televised hearings, McCarthy interrogated army officials, including many decorated war heroes.

But this was his tragic mistake. Television illustrated the mean-spiritedness of McCarthy's campaign. The army then went on the attack, questioning McCarthy's methods and credibility. In one memorable fusillade, the Council for the Army simply asked McCarthy, "At long last, have you no sense of decency left?"

Poll after poll showed the American people thought McCarthy unscrupulous in his attack of the army.

Fed up, McCarthy's colleagues censured him for dishonoring the Senate, and the hearings came to a close. Plagued with poor health and alcoholism, McCarthy himself died three years later.



McCarthy was not the only individual to seek out potential communists.

The HOUSE COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES (HUAC) targeted the Hollywood film industry. Actors, writers, and producers alike were summoned to appear before the committee and provide names of colleagues who may have been members of the Communist Party.

Those who repented and named names of suspected communists were allowed to return to business as usual. Those who refused to address the committee were cited for contempt. Uncooperative artists were blacklisted from jobs in the entertainment industry. Years passed until many had their reputations restored.


Were there in fact communists in America?

The answer is undoubtedly yes. But many of the accused had attended party rallies 15 or more years before the hearings — it had been fashionable to do so in the 1930s.

Although the Soviet spy ring did penetrate the highest levels of the American government, the vast majority of the accused were innocent victims. All across America, state legislatures and school boards mimicked McCarthy and HUAC. Thousands of people lost their jobs and had their reputations tarnished.

Other Witch-Hunt Victims

Unions were special target of communist hunters. Sensing an unfavorable environment, the AFL (AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR) and the CIO (CONGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS) merged in 1955 to close ranks. Books were pulled from library shelves, including Robin Hood, which was deemed communist-like for suggesting stealing from the rich to give to the poor.

No politician could consider opening trade with China or withdrawing from Southeast Asia without being branded a communist. Although McCarthyism was dead by the mid-1950s, its effects lasted for decades.

Above all, several messages became crystal clear to the average American: Don't criticize the United States. Don't be different. Just conform.

==== Suburban Growth

POSTWAR AFFLUENCE redefined the American Dream. Gone was the poverty borne of the Great Depression, and the years of wartime sacrifice were over.

Families that had delayed having additional children for years no longer waited, and the nation enjoyed a postwar BABY BOOM.

acial fears, affordable housing, and the desire to leave decaying cities were all factors that prompted many white Americans to flee to SUBURBIA.

'''

==== The Cold War Continues


The end of the Korean War in 1953 by no means brought an end to global hostilities.

As the British and French Empires slowly yielded to independence movements, a new Third World emerged. This became the major battleground of the Cold War as the United States and the Soviet Union struggled to bring new nations into their respective orbits. Across the Third World, the two superpowers squared off through proxy armies.

The United States's recognition of Israel in 1948 created a strong new ally, but created many enemies. Arab nations, enraged by American support for the new Jewish state, found supportive ears in the Soviet Union.

When Egyptian President GAMAL ABDEL NASSER sought to strengthen ties with the Soviet bloc, the United States withdrew its pledge to help Nasser construct the all-important ASWAN DAM. Nasser responded by nationalizing the SUEZ CANAL, an action that compelled British, French, and Israeli armies to invade Egypt.


Egyptian president Gamal Abder Nasser's 1956 nationalization of the Suez Canal, crippled the ability of Great Britain and France to trade internationally. As a result, the two countries allied with Israel to attack Egypt.

The Eisenhower Doctrine

The Western alliance was threatened as President Dwight Eisenhower called upon Britain and France to show restraint. With Soviet influence growing in the oil-rich region, Ike issued the Eisenhower Doctrine, which pledged American support to any governments fighting communist insurgencies in the Middle East. Making good on that promise, he sent over 5,000 marines to LEBANON to forestall an anti-Western takeover.


Asia provided more challenges for American containment policy.

To the south, communist revolutionary Ho Chi Minh successfully defeated the French colonial army to create the new nation of Vietnam. American commitment to the containment of communism led to a protracted involvement that would become the Vietnam War.


The CIA

In the aftermath of World War II, the United States created a new weapon to assist in fighting the Cold War: the CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY. In addition to gathering information on Soviet plans and maneuvers, the CIA also involved itself in covert operations designed to prevent communist dictators from rising to power.

The first such instance occurred in Iran, when Iranian Prime Minister MOHAMMED MOSSADEGH nationalized BRITISH PETROLEUM. Fearing Soviet influence in the powerful oil nation, the CIA recruited a phony mob to drive off Mossadegh and return the American-backed SHAH MOHAMMAD REZA PAHLAVI to power.

When JACOBO ARBENZ came to power in Guatemala, he promised to relieve the nation's impoverished farmers by seizing land held by the American-owned UNITED FRUIT COMPANY and redistributing it to the peasants. With the support of American air power, a CIA-backed band of mercenaries overthrew Arbenz and established a military dictatorship.



Throughout Latin America, the United States was seen as a brutal defender of thuggish autocrats at the expense of popularly elected leaders. Fidel Castro capitalized on this sentiment by overthrowing U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista from power in Cuba in January 1959.
