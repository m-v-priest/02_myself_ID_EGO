== 解说

=== Progressivism Sweeps (v.) the Nation 进步主义席卷全国

America in 1900 looked nothing like America in 1850. +
The Populists 人民党党员;民粹派 had tried to effect change by capturing the government. +
The Progressives 进步派；进步人士 would succeed where the Populists had failed.

[.my2]
1900 年的美国与 1850 年的美国完全不同。**民粹主义者试图通过"夺取政府"来实现变革。**"进步派"将在"民粹主义者"失败的地方取得成功。

It was more of a movement than a political party, and there were adherents 拥护者 to the philosophy in each major party. +
There were three PROGRESSIVE PRESIDENTS — Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson. +
Roosevelt and Taft were Republicans /and Wilson was a Democrat. +

`主` What united the movement `系` was a belief that `主` _the laissez faire 放任主义, Social Darwinist 社会达尔文主义者 outlook_ 观点；见解；世界观；人生观 of the Gilded Age `系` was morally 道德上，道义上 and intellectually wrong. +
Progressives believed that /people and government had the power to correct (v.) abuses 后定 produced by nature and the free market.

[.my2]
它更像是一场运动，而不是一个政党，每个主要政党都有这一理念的追随者。共有三位进步总统——西奥多·罗斯福、威廉·霍华德·塔夫脱, 和伍德罗·威尔逊。罗斯福和塔夫脱是共和党人，威尔逊是民主党人。**使这场运动团结起来的是一种信念，即镀金时代的自由放任、社会达尔文主义观点, 在道德和智力上都是错误的。**进步派相信, 人民和政府有权力, 纠正自然和自由市场造成的弊端。

.Theodore Roosevelt
image:/img/Theodore_Roosevelt_by_the_Pach_Bros.jpg[,30%]

老罗斯福(第26任美国正总统), 昵称泰迪（Teddy）. 美国历史上最伟大的总统之一，是美国进步时代的领导者之一。

西奥多·罗斯福在总统任期内，对国内的主要贡献是: +
- 建立资源保护政策，保护了森林、矿物、石油等资源； +
- 建立公平交易法案，推动了劳工与资本家和解。 +

对外 : +
- 对外奉行门罗主义，实行扩张政策，建设强大军队，干涉美洲事务。 +
- 他意识到：巴拿马运河对美国不仅具有经济价值，而且能够使美国海军舰队在太平洋和大西洋之间的调动更加快捷，具有重要的军事战略意义。因此，他在任内竭力推动巴拿马运河工程. +
- 成功调停了日俄战争，获得1906年的诺贝尔和平奖，是第一个获得此奖项的美国人。

西奥多·罗斯福是总统山(Mount Rushmore National Memorial)上四个总统雕像之中唯一的20世纪总统，与乔治·华盛顿(首任美国总统)、托马斯·杰斐逊(第3任美国总统), 和亚伯拉罕·林肯(第16任美國總統)并驾齐驱。 +
学者们普遍认为，他是现代美国的塑造者。也有人批评他的干涉主义和帝国主义政策。即便如此，历史学者评论美国总统时，他总在最出色的五位之中。

.William Howard Taft

image:/img/William Howard Taft.webp[,30%]

威廉·霍华德·塔夫脱, 第27任总统. 是史上唯一出任过"美国总统"和"美国首席大法官"两项职位的人. +
历史上多次美国总统排名中，塔夫脱大多位于中等水平。



.Woodrow Wilson

image:/img/Woodrow Wilson.jpg[,30%]

伍德罗·威尔逊. 美国第28任总统，他的主张被后人称为威尔逊主义。

-  在第一个任期中，威尔逊支持民主党控制的议会通过联邦储备法案（Federal Reserve Act），克莱顿反托拉斯法案（Clayton Antitrust Act），联邦农田贷款法案（Federal Farm Loan Act），还通过新的收入法, 在联邦一级开征收入税，以及建立"联邦贸易委员会"。
- 第二个任期的中心议题是第一次世界大战。尽管他在竞选时打出“他让我们远离战争”（he kept us out of the war）的口号，美国的中立政策却未能持久。 +
德国发送电报给墨西哥，声称若两国结盟，德国将帮助墨西哥重新获得被美国占领之北方数州。最终导致美国宣战. 不过威尔逊主要是关注参战的外交和财政面，而把作战任务交给军事部门。
- 在他的任期内, 普遍实现妇女选举权。
- 在战争的最后阶段，*威尔逊发表"十四点和平原则"，从中阐述他所认为的能够避免世界再遭战火的新世界秩序。1919年赴巴黎筹建"国际联盟", 以及拟定"凡尔赛条约"*，并尤其关注自战败帝国中建立新国家的问题。后主要由于他对创建"国联"的贡献，于1920年被授予1919年度的"诺贝尔和平奖"。 +
参院未通过美国加入国联的提议。尽管没有美国的加入，国联还是于1920年成立。

**威尔逊所秉持的国际主义，也被后人称为“威尔逊主义”，主张美国登上世界舞台来为民主而战斗，支持众小民族（如波兰）建立民族国家。**这成为以后美国外交政策中一个颇有争议的理念，为理想主义者所效仿，却为现实主义者所排斥。


.laissez faire
(是个法语词) 放任主义：政府在经济事务中不干涉的政策。自由放任主义的支持者, 主张政府与经济部门几乎完全分离。

The results were astonishing 惊人的，令人惊讶的. +
Seemingly every aspect of society was touched by progressive reform. +
Worker and consumer issues were addressed, conservation 保护，保存；节约 of natural resources was initiated (v.)开始；发起；创始, and the plight 苦难；困境；苦境 of the urban poor was confronted 面对（某事物）;处理，解决（问题或困境）. +

National political movements such as temperance 戒酒;自我克制；克己；节欲；节食 and women's suffrage 选举权；投票权 found (v.) allies in the progressive movement. +
The era produced _a host 许多；大量 of_ national and state regulations, *plus* (v.) four amendments *to* the Constitution.

[.my2]
**结果令人惊讶。似乎社会的方方面面, 都受到了"渐进式改革"的影响。**工人和消费者问题得到解决，自然资源保护得到启动，城市贫民的困境得到解决。禁酒和妇女选举权等全国政治运动, 在进步运动中找到了盟友。*这个时代产生了大量的国家和州法规，以及四项宪法修正案。*

[.my1]
.案例
====
.initiate
(v.) ( formal ) to make sth begin开始；发起；创始
====

When the United States became involved in the First World War, attention was diverted (v.)使转向；使绕道；转移 from domestic issues /and progressivism went into decline 下降，衰退. +
While unable to solve the problems of every American, the PROGRESSIVE ERA *set the stage 使某事成为可能；为某事铺平了道路 for* _the 20th century trend_ of _an activist 积极分子；活跃分子 government_ trying to assist its people.

[.my2]
**当美国卷入第一次世界大战时，注意力从国内问题上转移，"进步主义"开始衰落。虽然进步时代无法解决每个美国人的问题，但它为 20 世纪中, 积极政府试图帮助其人民的趋势, 奠定了基础。**

'''


==== Roots of the Movement 运动的根源

Underlying 位于…的下面；构成…的基础 this new era of reform `系`  was a fundamental shift 根本性转变 in philosophy away from Social Darwinism. +
Why *accept* (v.) hardship and suffering （内心或肉体的）痛苦，问题；痛苦的感觉 *as* simply the result of _natural selection_ 自然选择? Humans can and have adapted (v.)使适应，使适合（新用途、新情况）;调整 their physical environments to suit (v.)对（某人）方便；满足（某人）需要；合（某人）心意 their purposes. +
Individuals need (v.) not *accept* injustices *as* the "law of nature" if they can think of a better way.

[.my2]
**这一新改革时代的背后, 是哲学上从"社会达尔文主义"的根本转变。**为什么将困难和苦难, 仅仅视为自然选择的结果？人类可以, 而且已经调整他们的物理环境, 以适应他们的目的。*如果个人能够想出更好的方法，就不必接受"不公正"来作为“自然法则”(即"自然法则"的宿命论)。*

Philosopher WILLIAM JAMES called _this new way of thinking_, "PRAGMATISM 实用主义；务实思想；实用观点." His followers came to believe that /an activist government could be _the agent of the public_ to pursue (v.) the betterment 改进；改善；改良 of social ills.

[.my2]
哲学家威廉·詹姆斯将, 这种新的思维方式称为“实用主义”。他的追随者开始相信，一个激进的政府, 可以成为公众追求"改善社会弊病"的代理人。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.prag·ma·tism
[ U] ( formal ) thinking about solving problems in a practical and sensible way rather than by having fixed ideas and theories 实用主义；务实思想；实用观点

是一个哲学派别，*认为语言的目的, 不是"描述或反映"现实，而是把语言和思想视为"预测"、"解决问题"和"行动"的工具。* +
是一个哲学派别，认为语言的目的不是描述或反映现实，而是**把语言和思想, 视为预测、解决问题和行动的工具。 +**

实用主义者忠于事实，但没有反对神学的观点，如果神学的某些观念证明对具体的生活确有价值，就承认它是真实的。

实用主义的主要论点是：

- 强调知识是控制现实的工具，现实是可以改变的；
- *强调实际经验是最重要的，原则和推理是次要的. 现实是可以改变的. 信仰和观念是否真实, 在于它们是否能带来实际效果. 理论只是对行为结果的假定总结，是一种工具，是否有价值取决于是否能使行动成功.* 人对现实的解释，完全取决于现实对他的利益有什么效果. (很像"实践是检验真理的唯一标准")
- 强调行动优于教条，经验优于僵化的原则.

====

The Populist movement also influenced (v.) progressivism. +
`主` The Populist ideas of an _income tax_ 所得税 and _direct election of senators_ `谓` became the SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH AMENDMENTS to the United States Constitution under progressive direction.

[.my2]
民粹主义运动, 也影响了进步主义。"所得税"和"直接选举参议员"的民粹主义思想, 成为进步方向下的美国宪法第十六和第十七修正案。

Reforms went further by trying to *root (v.) out* 根除，消除 urban corruption by introducing new models of city government. +
The city commission and the city manager systems `谓` *removed* important decision making (n.)决策 *from* politicians /and placed it in the hands of skilled technicians.

[.my2]
改革进一步深入，试图通过引入新的城市政府模式, 来根除城市腐败。城市委员会, 和城市管理者系统, 将重要的决策权, 从政治家手中, 转移到了熟练的技术人员手中。

Progressivism came from so many sources 后定  from every region of America. +
The national _frame of mind_ 心态；心绪 was fixed.
Reform would occur.
It was only a matter of how much and what type.

[.my2]
进步主义来自美国各个地区的许多来源。民族心态已经固定。改革将会发生。这只是数量和类型的问题。

==== Woodrow Wilson's New Freedom 伍德罗·威尔逊的新自由



THOMAS WOODROW WILSON also saw the need for change.

[.my2]
托马斯·伍德罗·威尔逊, 也看到了变革的必要性。


His 1912 platform for change was called the NEW FREEDOM.

[.my2]
他 1912 年的变革平台, 被称为“新自由”。

The New Freedom sought to achieve （凭长期努力）达到（某目标、地位、标准） this vision by attacking what Wilson called the TRIPLE WALL OF PRIVILEGE 三重特权墙 — the tariff, the banks, and the trusts.

[.my2]
新自由, 试图通过攻击威尔逊所说的三重特权墙——关税、银行和信托, 来实现这一愿景。


Tariffs protected the large industrialists *at the expense of* small farmers. +
Wilson signed the UNDERWOOD-SIMMONS ACT into law in 1913, which reduced tariff rates. +
The banking system also pinched 捏住；夹紧 small farmers and entrepreneurs. +
The gold standard 金本位制度 still made currency 通货，货币 too tight 牢固的；紧的；不松动的, and loans were too expensive for the average 普通的，平常的 American. +
Wilson signed _the FEDERAL RESERVE 储备（量），储藏（量） ACT_, which made the nation's currency more flexible 能适应新情况的；灵活的；可变动的.

[.my2]
关税保护了大工业家，但牺牲了小农的利益。 1913 年，威尔逊将《安德伍德-西蒙斯法案》签署成为法律，降低了关税税率。银行体系也给小农和企业家带来了压力。金本位制, 仍然导致货币过于紧缩，贷款对于普通美国人来说过于昂贵。威尔逊签署了《联邦储备法》，使国家货币更加灵活。

Unlike Roosevelt, Wilson did not distinguish (v.)区分；辨别；分清 between "good" trusts and "bad" trusts. +
Any trust *by virtue  of* 凭借；依靠；由于；因为 its large size `系` was bad in Wilson's eyes. +
_The CLAYTON ANTITRUST 反垄断的；反托拉斯的 ACT_ OF 1914 `谓`  clarified 使更清晰易懂；阐明；澄清 _the Sherman Act_ by specifically naming (v.) _certain business tactics_ illegal. +
This same act also *exempted* (v.)免除；豁免 labor unions *from* antitrust suits 反垄断诉讼, and *declared* (v.) strikes, boycotts, and peaceful picketing 进行纠察封锁；担任警戒；围厂抗议 *perfectly legal*.

[.my2]
与罗斯福不同，威尔逊没有区分“好”信托和“坏”信托。在威尔逊看来，任何规模庞大的信托都是不好的。 1914 年《克莱顿反垄断法》明确指出某些商业策略为非法，从而澄清了《谢尔曼法》。该法案还使工会免受"反垄断诉讼"，并宣布罢工、抵制, 和和平示威, 完全合法。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.BY/IN VIRTUE OF STH
( formal ) by means of or because of sth凭借；依靠；由于；因为
• She got the job *by virtue 优点；长处；用处 of* her greater experience. 她由于经验较为丰富, 而得到了那份工作。

.picketing
[ U] the activity of standing outside the entrance to a building in order to protest about sth and stop people from entering the building 进行纠察封锁；担任警戒；围厂抗议 +

In two years, he successfully attacked each "wall of privilege." Now his eyes turned to greater concerns, particularly the outbreak of the FIRST WORLD WAr in Europe.

[.my2]
两年的时间里，他成功地攻破了每一道“特权之墙”。现在他的目光转向了更大的担忧，特别是第一次世界大战在欧洲的爆发。


When Wilson's first term expired (v.)（因到期而）失效，终止；到期, he felt he had to do more. +
The nation was on the brink （新的、危险的，或令人兴奋的处境的）边缘，初始状态 of entering the bloodiest conflict in human history, and Wilson had definite (a.)肯定；有把握;肯定的；确定的；不会改变的 ideas about how the postwar peace should look. +
But he would have to survive reelection first.

[.my2]
当威尔逊的第一个任期结束时，他觉得自己必须做更多的事情。这个国家正处于人类历史上最血腥的冲突的边缘，威尔逊对于战后的和平应该是什么样子, 有明确的想法。但他首先必须成功连任。

As an appeal to the Roosevelt progressives, he began to sign many legislative measures 后定 suggested by _the BULL MOOSE 麋，驼鹿 CAMPAIGN_. +
He approved of 赞成、支持 the creation of _a federal trade commission_ to act (v.) as a watchdog over business. +
_A child labor bill_ 童工法案 and _a workers' compensation act_ 劳工赔偿法 became law. +
Wilson agreed *to limit* the workday of _interstate (a.)（尤指美国）州与州之间的，州际的 railroad workers_ *to* 8 hours. +
He signed _a FEDERAL FARM LOAN ACT_ 联邦农业贷款法案 to ease (v.) the pains of life on the farm.

[.my2]
作为对罗斯福进步派的呼吁，他开始签署公牛驼鹿运动建议的许多立法措施。他批准成立"联邦贸易委员会"来充当商业监管机构。童工法案和工人赔偿法案, 成为法律。威尔逊同意将州际铁路工人的工作日, 限制为 8 小时。他签署了《联邦农场贷款法》以减轻农场生活的痛苦。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Bull Moose Party
进步党俗称“公驼鹿党”，是美国的第三方政党. 新政党以在"渐进式改革"方面占据领先地位, 并吸引全国领先的改革者而闻名。该党在意识形态上, 也与美国的激进自由主义传统有着密切的联系。 +
该党在1912年美国总统选举中失利后，选举中的名气迅速下滑，直到1918年，到1920年消失。“公驼鹿”的绰号起源于罗斯福在输掉共和党总统后, 吹嘘自己“像公驼鹿一样坚强”。

作为共和党成员，罗斯福于 1901 年至 1909 年担任总统，并在其总统任期的最后几年变得越来越进步。在 1908 年总统选举中，罗斯福帮助确保战争部长塔夫脱接替他。 1912 年共和党全国代表大会上，塔夫脱以微弱优势击败罗斯福，获得党内总统提名。大会结束后，罗斯福等进步共和党人, 成立了"进步党".

该党的纲领, 建立在罗斯福的“公平交易”国内计划的基础上，并呼吁进行多项渐进式改革。该纲领声称，“解散'腐败商业'与'腐败政治'之间的邪恶联盟, 是当今政治家的首要任务”。该平台上的提案包括限: 制竞选资金捐款、降低关税、建立社会保险制度、八小时工作日, 和妇女选举权。该党在大企业监管问题上, 存在分歧.

公驼鹿是该党的官方吉祥物.

《巴黎条约》对获胜者来说是最慷慨的。美国接收了菲律宾, 以及关岛和波多黎各群岛。古巴独立，西班牙因损失获得2000万美元赔偿。该条约在美国引发了激烈争论。反帝国主义者称美国虚伪，一边谴责欧洲帝国, 一边追求自己的帝国。这场战争的目的, 应该是解放古巴，而不是夺取菲律宾。当埃米利奥·阿吉纳尔多（Emilio Aguinaldo）领导的菲律宾叛乱分子, 针对美国新殖民者, 发动为期三年的叛乱时，批评声不断增加。美西战争持续了十周，造成 400 人阵亡，而菲律宾叛乱持续了近三年，夺去了 4000 名美国人的生命。尽管如此，麦金莱总统的扩张主义政策, 得到了美国公众的支持，他们似乎非常愿意接受新扩张帝国的祝福和诅咒。

==== The Roosevelt Corollary and Latin America 罗斯福推论(门罗主义) 与拉丁美洲


For many years, the Monroe Doctrine was practically a _dead letter_ 无人遵守的法律；形同虚设的规定；空文. +
`主` The bold proclamation 宣言；公告；声明 of 1823 that declared the Western Hemisphere forever free (v.) from European expansion `谓` bemused (v.)使发呆；使茫然；使困惑 the imperial powers who knew the United States was simply too weak to enforce its claim. +
By 1900, the situation had changed. +
A bold, expanding America was spreading its wings, daring (v.)敢于，胆敢 _the old world order_ to challenge its newfound 新发现的；新得到的 might. +
When Theodore Roosevelt became President, he decided to reassert (v.)重申；坚持 Monroe's old declaration.

[.my2]
多年来，"门罗主义"实际上是一纸空文。 1823 年，西半球永远不再受欧洲扩张的大胆宣言，让帝国列强感到困惑，因为他们知道美国太弱，无法执行其主张。到了1900年，情况发生了变化。一个大胆、不断扩张的美国, 正在展开翅膀，敢于向旧世界秩序挑战其新发现的力量。当"西奥多·罗斯福"就任总统时，他决定重申门罗的旧宣言。


[.my1]
.案例
====
"daring the old world order to challenge its newfound might" 意思是“向旧的世界秩序挑战，敢于让他们对美国新获得的强大力量发起挑战 (即美国不惧于老列强对美国发起的挑战)”。具体来说，这句话描绘了一个场景：到1900年，美国变得更加强大和自信，不再像以前那样软弱无力。美国在这种新的强大力量的支持下，向欧洲的老牌列强（即“旧的世界秩序”）发出挑战，几乎是在挑衅他们来试图对抗美国的力量。

The Platt Amendment

[.my2]
普拉特修正案

Cuba became the foundation for a new LATIN AMERICAN POLICY. +
Fearful that the new nation would be prey (v.)捕食；猎获 to the imperial vultures 秃鹰 of Europe, United States diplomats sharpened American talons （某些鸟类，尤指猛禽的）爪 on the island. +

In the PLATT AMENDMENT OF 1901, Cuba was forbidden from entering any treaty that might endanger their independence. +
In addition, *to prevent* European gunboats 炮艇 *from* landing on Cuban shores, Cuba was prohibited from incurring 招致；遭受；引起 a large debt. +
If any of these conditions were violated, Cuba agreed to permit American troops to land (v.) to restore (v.)恢复（某种情况或感受） order. +

Lastly, the United States was granted a lease （房屋、设备或土地的）租约，租契 on a naval base at GUANTANAMO BAY. +
Independent in name only, Cuba became a legal PROTECTORATE 受保护国；受保护领地 of the United States.

[.my2]
古巴成为新拉丁美洲政策的基础。由于担心这个新国家会成为欧洲帝国秃鹰的猎物，美国外交官在岛上磨利了美国的爪子。 **1901 年普拉特修正案, 禁止古巴加入任何可能危及其独立的条约。**此外，**为了防止欧洲炮舰登陆古巴海岸，古巴被禁止承担巨额债务。如果这些条件中的任何一个被违反，古巴同意允许美国军队登陆以恢复秩序。** 最后，美国获得了"关塔那摩湾海军基地"的租赁权。*古巴只是名义上独立，成为美国的合法保护国。*

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Guantanamo Bay 关塔那摩湾

image:/img/Guantanamo Bay 1.jpg[,47%]
image:/img/077.png[,47%]

位于古巴东南端关塔那摩省。湾中设有一属于美国海军的"关塔那摩湾海军基地"，占地116平方公里。后来该基地被美军用于拘留和审讯在阿富汗与伊拉克等地区的战事中, 捕获的恐怖活动嫌疑人、战俘。*此地因为算是租借的古巴领土，法理上受刑人的权利不受联邦法律保护与监管，美国政府便可以为所欲为向受刑人迫供.*

1898年，"美西战争"，美国从西班牙帝国手中夺走全部古巴，将其纳为"保护国"，并在"关塔那摩湾"建立了"美国海军关塔那摩基地"（U.S. +
Naval Station Guantanamo Bay）。

1901年2月，美国总统威廉·麦金莱签署**《普拉特修正案》，法案规定, 美国有权对古巴实行军事干涉，并要求古巴让岀部分领土给美国建立军事基地和开采煤矿等。**《普拉特修正案》作为附录写入了古巴宪法。根据这一法案，美国在1903年, 从第一任古巴总统手中, 获得一份**租借"关塔那摩湾部分土地"的永久性租契，**起始日期为1903年2月23日，这成为了今日租约的依据。

古巴人认为《普拉特修正案》允许美国入侵其领土，因此1934年巴蒂斯塔上台后, **此法案便告废弃。同年两国签署一项新的条约，保留了美军对"关塔那摩湾"的租契，并允许古巴和其贸易伙伴, 免费使用此湾。**除此之外还加入一项条件，规定只有当美国和古巴政府均同意后, 才能废止这项租契，或美国放弃基地财产.

当初并没有想到古巴革命变成社会主义国家，导致后来极为特殊的现象，美军可“合理”的声称自己有权驻扎在社会主义国家古巴。是美国唯一设在敌对社会主义国家领土上的军事基地。

Roosevelt Corollary

[.my2]
罗斯福推论

Convinced (v.)坚信；深信；确信 that all of Latin America was vulnerable to European attack, President Roosevelt *dusted off* 除去…的灰尘 the Monroe Doctrine and added his own corollary 推论；必然的结果. +

While the Monroe Doctrine blocked further expansion of Europe in the Western Hemisphere, the Roosevelt Corollary went one step further. +
Should （表示可能）假如，万一 any Latin American nation *engage in* "CHRONIC WRONGDOING 长期不当行为," a phrase that included large debts or civil unrest 动荡；动乱；骚动, the United States military would intervene. +
Europe was to remain across the Atlantic, while America would police (v.)监督；管制;巡查；维护治安  the Western Hemisphere. +

The first opportunity to enforce this new policy `谓` came in 1905, when the DOMINICAN REPUBLIC was in jeopardy (n.)处于危险境地；受到威胁 of invasion by European debt collectors. +
The United States invaded the island nation, seized its customs houses 海关大楼, and ruled the Dominican Republic as a protectorate 受保护国；受保护领地 until the situation was stablilized.

[.my2]
罗斯福总统深信, 整个拉丁美洲都容易受到欧洲的攻击，因此他重新审视了门罗主义，并添加了自己的推论。**虽然门罗主义阻止了欧洲在西半球的进一步扩张，但罗斯福推论却更进一步。如果任何拉丁美洲国家出现“长期错误行为”（包括巨额债务或内乱），美国军方就会进行干预。欧洲将留在大西洋彼岸，而美国将负责西半球的治安。** 执行这项新政策的第一个机会, 出现在 1905 年，当时多米尼加共和国, 正面临欧洲收债人入侵的危险。美国入侵这个岛国，占领其海关，并将多米尼加共和国作为保护国统治，直到局势稳定为止。

A Big Stick

[.my2]
一根大棒

The effects of the new policy were enormous. +
Teddy Roosevelt had a motto 座右铭，格言，警句: "SPEAK SOFTLY AND CARRY A BIG STICK." To Roosevelt, the big stick was the new American navy. +
By remaining (v.) firm in resolve (n.)决心；坚定的信念  /and possessing the naval might 强大力量；威力 to back (v.) its interests, the United States could simultaneously 同时地 defend (v.) its territory and avoid war. +

Latin Americans did not look upon 看待，把……看作 the corollary 推论；必然的结果 favorably 顺利地；亲切地；好意地. +

By the end of the 20th century, the United States would *send* troops of invasion *to* Latin America over 35 times, establishing an undisputed _sphere of influence_ 势力范围 throughout the hemisphere.

[.my2]
新政策的影响是巨大的。泰迪·罗斯福有一句座右铭：“轻声细语，携带大棒。”对罗斯福来说，大棒就是新的美国海军。通过保持坚定的决心, 并拥有海军力量来支持其利益，美国可以同时保卫其领土, 并避免战争。拉丁美洲人并不看好这个推论。他们对美国的介入表示不满，认为这是"洋基帝国主义"，对他们的北方大邻国的敌意急剧增长。到20世纪末，美国已向拉丁美洲派遣入侵部队超过35次，在整个西半球建立了无可争议的势力范围。

==== Reaching to Asia 走向亚洲


The United States could not *ignore* the largest continent on earth *forever*. +
Since COMMODORE 海军准将 MATTHEW PERRY "opened" Japan in 1854, trade with Asia was a reality, *earning* millions *for* American merchants and manufacturers. +
Slowly but surely the United States acquired (v.)（通过努力、能力、行为表现）获得，得到 holdings 占有的财产；所持股份 in the region, making the ties even stronger. +

Already Alaska, Hawaii, and American Samoa `谓` flew the American flag. +
The Spanish-American War brought (v.) Guam and the Philippines as well. +
These territories needed supply routes 补给线 and defense, so _ports of trade_ 贸易港口 and _naval bases_ became crucial.

[.my2]
美国不能永远忽视地球上最大的大陆。自从 1854 年海军准将马修·佩里“开辟”日本以来，与亚洲的贸易, 就成为现实，为美国商人和制造商, 赚取了数百万美元。美国缓慢但坚定地收购了该地区的股份，使两国关系更加牢固。阿拉斯加、夏威夷, 和美属萨摩亚, 已经悬挂了美国国旗。美西战争也带来了关岛和菲律宾。这些领土需要补给路线和防御，因此贸易港口和海军基地, 变得至关重要。

1900年，萨摩亚群岛被一分为二，东部岛屿由美国统治成为现"美属萨摩亚"，而西部岛屿则成为德国殖民地。

- 西萨摩亚 :  +
第一次世界大战后, 1919年，依照凡尔赛条约，德国把"西萨摩亚", 让给新西兰委任统治。直到1962年1月1日“西萨摩亚独立国”成立, 将国名改为“萨摩亚独立国”.

- 美属萨摩亚 (东萨摩亚) :
是美国在南太平洋的属地，在美国法律中定位为“未通过组织法的未合并属地”. +
美国通过1929年2月20日一项国会法案，正式接受将这些岛屿割让给美国的契约。该法案规定，**当地居民享有美国国民地位。**该法案规定设立一个美属萨摩亚政府，其一切民政、司法和军事方面的权力, 属于美国总统指定的人。由于美国在该地区的利益主要是军事利益，该领土由美国海军管辖。1951年一项行政命令把对该领土的权力移交给"内政部"。

"美属萨摩亚"位于大洋洲，**是美国在南半球唯一的领地，**土地面积199平方公里（76.8平方英里），比华盛顿市稍大.

The imperial powers, faced with having to *admit* （勉强）承认；招认 publicly *to* greedy (a.)贪婪的；贪心的 designs (n.)打算；意图；目的 in China, remained silent /and the Open Door went into effect.

[.my2]
这个地球上人口最多的国家, 已经被欧洲帝国瓜分。中国仍然有皇帝和政府制度，但外国列强真正控制了它。尽管中华帝国没有划分为像非洲那样的殖民地，但欧洲在1894年之后, 确实建立了被称为“势力范围”的准殖民地实体。以这种方式享有特权的国家包括 : 英国、法国、俄罗斯、德国和日本。 +
国务卿约翰·海伊担心，如果这些国家建立排斥其他国家的贸易惯例，美国的贸易将会受到影响。英国同意了，海伊制定了一项维护开放贸易的战略。他向所有大国散发了名为“门户开放通知”的信件，要求所有国家同意在中国进行自由贸易。尽管英国同意了，但所有其他国家私下都拒绝了。然而，海伊向全世界撒了谎，宣称所有人都接受了。面对不得不公开承认在中国的贪婪图谋时，列强只能保持沉默，"门户开放"于是开始生效。

There were many obstacles to such a project. +
The first was Great Britain. +
Fearing that either side would build an isthmathian 地峡的；形成地峡的 canal and use (v.) it for national advantage, the United States and Great Britain agreed in the 1850 CLAYTON-BULWER TREATY that neither side would build such a canal. +

A half century later, the now dominant United States wanted to nullify (v.)使无效，作废；取消 this deal 协议；（尤指）交易. +
Great Britain, nervous (a.) about its SOUTH AFRICAN BOER WAR and an increasingly cloudy Europe, sought (v.) to make a friend in the United States. +

One roadblock was clear.

[.my2]
这样一个项目有很多障碍。第一个是英国。*由于担心任何一方会修建一条地峡运河, 并将其用于国家利益，美国和英国在 1850 年《克莱顿-布尔沃条约》中, 同意双方都不会修建这样一条运河。半个世纪后，目前占主导地位的美国, 想要废除这项协议。而此时英国对南非布尔战争, 和日益阴云密布的欧洲, 感到紧张，因此希望寻求美国做朋友。* 《海-庞斯福特条约》允许美国修建和加固中美洲运河，只要美国承诺向所有国家收取相同的费用。一个障碍是明确的。

Selecting (v.) Panama

[.my2]
选择巴拿马

The next question was where to build. +
FERDINAND DE LESSUPS, the same engineer who designed the SUEZ CANAL, had organized a French attempt in Panama in the 1870s. +
Disease and financial problems left a partially built canal behind. +

While it made sense 有意义；合理的，明智的 that the United States should buy the rights to complete the effort, Panama posed (v.) other problems. +
Despite being the most narrow nation in the region, Panama was very mountainous, and a complex series of locks 锁；水闸 was necessary to move (v.) ships across the isthmus 地峡. +

Nicaragua was another possibility. +
The canal would be situated (v.)使位于；使坐落于 closer to the United States. +
The terrain was flatter, and despite Nicaragua's width, there were numerous lakes that could be connected. +
Volcanic (a.)火山的，火山引发的 activity in Nicaragua `谓` prompted the United States to try to buy the territory in Panama.

[.my2]
**下一个问题是在哪里建造。**设计苏伊士运河的工程师费迪南德·德·莱苏普, 曾在19世纪70年代, 组织法国人在巴拿马进行尝试。疾病和财政问题, 导致部分修建的运河被搁置。 +
虽然美国应该购买完成这项工作的权利是有道理的，但巴拿马也带来了其他问题。*尽管巴拿马是该地区最狭窄的国家，但它多山，需要一系列复杂的船闸, 才能让船只穿过地峡。尼加拉瓜是另一种可能性。运河将距离美国更近。地势较为平坦，尽管尼加拉瓜幅员辽阔，但可以连通的湖泊众多。但尼加拉瓜的火山活动, 促使美国还是选择尽力购买巴拿马的土地。*

- 公平交易：1901年，在罗斯福的第一次对国会演说中，他要求国会立法，对托拉斯的经营活动给予合理的限制。国会并未采取行动，但是罗斯福却发起44个针对大企业的法律诉讼，因此人送外号“托拉斯驯兽师”。
- 调解煤矿罢工：1902年，美国矿工联合会发动煤矿工人大罢工，威胁城市取暖燃料供应，引发了一场举国危机。罗斯福召集矿主和劳工领袖在白宫开会，达成妥协，将工作时间从每天10小时缩短到9小时，并且让工人得到10%的加薪，结束了持续163天的罢工。
- 促使国会通过《纯净食品和药品法》和《肉类产品监督法案》，对养畜和肉类加工企业进行稽查, 和实施强制卫生标准。

=== Progressivism Sweeps the Nation

America in 1900 looked nothing like America in 1850. The Populists had tried to effect change by capturing the government. The Progressives would succeed where the Populists had failed.

It was more of a movement than a political party, and there were adherents to the philosophy in each major party. There were three PROGRESSIVE PRESIDENTS — Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson. Roosevelt and Taft were Republicans and Wilson was a Democrat. What united the movement was a belief that the laissez faire, Social Darwinist outlook of the Gilded Age was morally and intellectually wrong. Progressives believed that people and government had the power to correct abuses produced by nature and the free market.

The results were astonishing. Seemingly every aspect of society was touched by progressive reform. Worker and consumer issues were addressed, conservation of natural resources was initiated, and the plight of the urban poor was confronted. National political movements such as temperance and women's suffrage found allies in the progressive movement. The era produced a host of national and state regulations, plus four amendments to the Constitution.

When the United States became involved in the First World War, attention was diverted from domestic issues and progressivism went into decline. While unable to solve the problems of every American, the PROGRESSIVE ERA set the stage for the 20th century trend of an activist government trying to assist its people.

'''


==== Roots of the Movement

Underlying this new era of reform was a fundamental shift in philosophy away from Social Darwinism. Why accept hardship and suffering as simply the result of natural selection? Humans can and have adapted their physical environments to suit their purposes. Individuals need not accept injustices as the "law of nature" if they can think of a better way.

Philosopher WILLIAM JAMES called this new way of thinking, "PRAGMATISM." His followers came to believe that an activist government could be the agent of the public to pursue the betterment of social ills.

The Populist movement also influenced progressivism. The Populist ideas of an income tax and direct election of senators became the SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH AMENDMENTS to the United States Constitution under progressive direction.

Reforms went further by trying to root out urban corruption by introducing new models of city government. The city commission and the city manager systems removed important decision making from politicians and placed it in the hands of skilled technicians.

Progressivism came from so many sources from every region of America. The national frame of mind was fixed. Reform would occur. It was only a matter of how much and what type.

Between 1901 and 1921, the Presidents were more active and powerful than any since the days of Abraham Lincoln.








'''

==== Woodrow Wilson's New Freedom



THOMAS WOODROW WILSON also saw the need for change.


His 1912 platform for change was called the NEW FREEDOM.

The New Freedom sought to achieve this vision by attacking what Wilson called the TRIPLE WALL OF PRIVILEGE — the tariff, the banks, and the trusts.


Tariffs protected the large industrialists at the expense of small farmers. Wilson signed the UNDERWOOD-SIMMONS ACT into law in 1913, which reduced tariff rates. The banking system also pinched small farmers and entrepreneurs. The gold standard still made currency too tight, and loans were too expensive for the average American. Wilson signed the FEDERAL RESERVE ACT, which made the nation's currency more flexible.

Unlike Roosevelt, Wilson did not distinguish between "good" trusts and "bad" trusts. Any trust by virtue of its large size was bad in Wilson's eyes. The CLAYTON ANTITRUST ACT OF 1914 clarified the Sherman Act by specifically naming certain business tactics illegal. This same act also exempted labor unions from antitrust suits, and declared strikes, boycotts, and peaceful picketing perfectly legal.

In two years, he successfully attacked each "wall of privilege." Now his eyes turned to greater concerns, particularly the outbreak of the FIRST WORLD WAr in Europe.


When Wilson's first term expired, he felt he had to do more. The nation was on the brink of entering the bloodiest conflict in human history, and Wilson had definite ideas about how the postwar peace should look. But he would have to survive reelection first.

As an appeal to the Roosevelt progressives, he began to sign many legislative measures suggested by the BULL MOOSE CAMPAIGN. He approved of the creation of a federal trade commission to act as a watchdog over business. A child labor bill and a workers' compensation act became law. Wilson agreed to limit the workday of interstate railroad workers to 8 hours. He signed a FEDERAL FARM LOAN ACT to ease the pains of life on the farm.

Progressive Republicans in the Congress were pleased by Wilson's conversion to their brand of progressivism, and the American people showed their approval by electing him to a second term.

=== Seeking Empire

Since the early days of Jamestown colony, Americans were constantly stretching their boundaries to encompass more territory. When the United States government was formed, the practice continued. The first half of the 19th century was spent defining the nation's borders through negotiation and war, and the second half was spent populating the fruits of the labor. As the 20th century dawned, many believed that the expansion should continue.

Many different groups pushed for AMERICAN EXPANSION OVERSEAS. Industrialists sought new markets for their products and sources for cheaper resources. Nationalists claimed that colonies were a hallmark of national prestige. The European powers had already claimed much of the globe; America would have to compete or perish. Missionaries continually preached to spread their messages of faith. Social Darwinists such as Josiah Strong believed that American civilization was superior to others and that it was an American's duty to diffuse its benefits. Alfred Thayer Mahan wrote an influential thesis declaring that throughout history, those that controlled the seas controlled the world. Acquiring naval bases at strategic points around the world was imperative.



Before 1890, American lands consisted of little more than the contiguous states and Alaska. By the end of World War I, America could boast a global empire. American Samoa and Hawaii were added in the 1890s by force. The Spanish-American War brought Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines under the American flag. The ROOSEVELT COROLLARY to the Monroe Doctrine declared the entire western hemisphere an American sphere of influence. Through initial negotiation and eventual intimidation, the United States secured the rights to build and operate an isthmathian canal in Panama. The German naval threat in World War I prompted the purchase of the VIRGIN ISLANDS from Denmark in 1917.




The country that had once fought to throw off imperial shackles was now itself an empire.

==== 美西战争 : 获得 波多黎各, 关岛, 菲律宾

CUBA became the nexus of Spanish-American tensions. Since 1895, Cubans had been in open revolt against Spanish rule. The following year, Spain sent GENERAL VALERIANO WEYLER to Cuba to sedate the rebels. Anyone suspected of supporting independence was removed from the general population and sent to concentration camps. Although few were summarily executed, conditions at the camps led over 200,000 to die of disease and malnutrition. The news reached the American mainland through the newspapers of the yellow journalists.


To send a message to the rest of the world that the United States was interested in Cuban independence instead of American colonization, Congress passed the TELLER AMENDMENT, which promised that America would not annex the precious islands.


Prior to the building of the Panama Canal, each nation required a two-ocean navy. The major portion of Spain's Pacific fleet was located in the Spanish Philippines at MANILA BAY. Under orders from Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt, ADMIRAL GEORGE DEWEY descended upon the Philippines prior to the declaration of war.

The TREATY OF PARIS was most generous to the winners. The United States received the Philippines and the islands of GUAM and PUERTO RICO. Cuba became independent, and Spain was awarded $20 million dollars for its losses. The treaty prompted a heated debate in the United States. ANTI-IMPERIALISTS called the US hypocritical for condemning European empires while pursuing one of its own. The war was supposed to be about freeing Cuba, not seizing the Philippines. Criticism increased when Filipino rebels led by Emilio Aguinaldo waged a 3-year insurrection against their new American colonizers. While the Spanish-American War lasted ten weeks and resulted in 400 battle deaths, the PHILIPPINE INSURRECTION lasted nearly three years and claimed 4000 American lives. Nevertheless, President McKinley's expansionist policies were supported by the American public, who seemed more than willing to accept the blessings and curses of their new expanding empire.




'''


==== The Roosevelt Corollary and Latin America


For many years, the Monroe Doctrine was practically a dead letter. The bold proclamation of 1823 that declared the Western Hemisphere forever free from European expansion bemused the imperial powers who knew the United States was simply too weak to enforce its claim. By 1900, the situation had changed. A bold, expanding America was spreading its wings, daring the old world order to challenge its newfound might. When Theodore Roosevelt became President, he decided to reassert Monroe's old declaration.

The Platt Amendment

Cuba became the foundation for a new LATIN AMERICAN POLICY. Fearful that the new nation would be prey to the imperial vultures of Europe, United States diplomats sharpened American talons on the island. In the PLATT AMENDMENT OF 1901, Cuba was forbidden from entering any treaty that might endanger their independence. In addition, to prevent European gunboats from landing on Cuban shores, Cuba was prohibited from incurring a large debt. If any of these conditions were violated, Cuba agreed to permit American troops to land to restore order. Lastly, the United States was granted a lease on a naval base at GUANTANAMO BAY. Independent in name only, Cuba became a legal PROTECTORATE of the United States.




Roosevelt Corollary

Convinced that all of Latin America was vulnerable to European attack, President Roosevelt dusted off the Monroe Doctrine and added his own corollary. While the Monroe Doctrine blocked further expansion of Europe in the Western Hemisphere, the Roosevelt Corollary went one step further. Should any Latin American nation engage in "CHRONIC WRONGDOING," a phrase that included large debts or civil unrest, the United States military would intervene. Europe was to remain across the Atlantic, while America would police the Western Hemisphere. The first opportunity to enforce this new policy came in 1905, when the DOMINICAN REPUBLIC was in jeopardy of invasion by European debt collectors. The United States invaded the island nation, seized its customs houses, and ruled the Dominican Republic as a protectorate until the situation was stablilized.



A Big Stick

The effects of the new policy were enormous. Teddy Roosevelt had a motto: "SPEAK SOFTLY AND CARRY A BIG STICK." To Roosevelt, the big stick was the new American navy. By remaining firm in resolve and possessing the naval might to back its interests, the United States could simultaneously defend its territory and avoid war. Latin Americans did not look upon the corollary favorably. They resented U.S. involvement as YANKEE IMPERIALISM, and animosity against their large neighbor to the North grew dramatically. By the end of the 20th century, the United States would send troops of invasion to Latin America over 35 times, establishing an undisputed sphere of influence throughout the hemisphere.


'''

==== Reaching to Asia


The United States could not ignore the largest continent on earth forever. Since COMMODORE MATTHEW PERRY "opened" Japan in 1854, trade with Asia was a reality, earning millions for American merchants and manufacturers. Slowly but surely the United States acquired holdings in the region, making the ties even stronger. Already Alaska, Hawaii, and American Samoa flew the American flag. The Spanish-American War brought Guam and the Philippines as well. These territories needed supply routes and defense, so ports of trade and naval bases became crucial.





Open Door Policy

The most populous nation on earth was already divided between encroaching European empires. China still had an emperor and system of government, but the foreign powers were truly in control. Although the Chinese Empire was not carved into colonies such as Africa, Europe did establish quasi-colonial entities called SPHERES OF INFLUENCE after 1894. Those enjoying special privileges in this fashion included Great Britain, France, Russia, Germany, and Japan. Secretary of State John Hay feared that if these nations established trade practices that excluded other nations, American trade would suffer. Britain agreed and Hay devised a strategy to preserve open trade. He circulated letters among all the powers called OPEN DOOR NOTES, requesting that all nations agree to free trade in China. While Britain agreed, all the other powers declined in private responses. Hay, however, lied to the world and declared that all had accepted. The imperial powers, faced with having to admit publicly to greedy designs in China, remained silent and the Open Door went into effect.

The Boxer Rebellion

In 1900, foreign occupation of China resulted in disaster. A group of Chinese nationalists called the FISTS OF RIGHTEOUS HARMONY attacked Western property. The BOXERS, as they were known in the West, continued to wreak havoc until a multinational force invaded to stop the uprising. The BOXER REBELLION marked the first time United States armed forces invaded another continent without aiming to acquire the territory. The rebels were subdued, and China was forced to pay an indemnity of $330 million to the United States.

Nobel Peace Prize for Roosevelt

Japan was also a concern for the new imperial America. In 1904, war broke out between RUSSIA AND JAPAN. The war was going poorly for the Russians. Theodore Roosevelt offered to mediate the peace process as the war dragged on. The two sides met with Roosevelt in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and before long, a treaty was arranged. Despite agreeing to its terms, the Japanese public felt that Japan should have been awarded more concessions. Anti-American rioting swept the island. Meanwhile, Roosevelt was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. This marked the first time an American President received such an offer.

Relations with Japan remained icy. In California, JAPANESE IMMIGRANTS to America were faced with harsh discrimination, including segregated schooling. In the informal GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT OF 1907, the United States agreed to end the practice of separate schooling in exchange for a promise to end Japanese immigration. That same year, Roosevelt decided to display his "big stick," the new American navy. He sent the flotilla, known around the world as the GREAT WHITE FLEET, on a worldwide tour. Although it was meant to intimidate potential aggressors, particularly Japan, the results of the journey were uncertain. Finally, in 1908, Japan and the United States agreed to respect each other's holdings on the Pacific Rim in the ROOT-TAKAHIRA AGREEMENT. Sending troops overseas, mediating international conflicts, and risking trouble to maintain free trade, the United States began to rapidly shed its ISOLATIONIST past.




'''

==== The Panama Canal

A canal was inevitable. A trip by boat from New York to San Francisco forced a luckless crew to sail around the tip of South America — a journey amounting to some 12,000 miles. The new empire might require a fast move from the Atlantic to the Pacific by a naval squadron. Teddy Roosevelt decided that the time for action was at hand. The canal would be his legacy, and he would stop at nothing to get it.




First Obstacles

There were many obstacles to such a project. The first was Great Britain. Fearing that either side would build an isthmathian canal and use it for national advantage, the United States and Great Britain agreed in the 1850 CLAYTON-BULWER TREATY that neither side would build such a canal. A half century later, the now dominant United States wanted to nullify this deal. Great Britain, nervous about its SOUTH AFRICAN BOER WAR and an increasingly cloudy Europe, sought to make a friend in the United States. The HAY-PAUNCEFOTE TREATY permitted the United States to build and fortify a Central American canal, so long as the Americans promised to charge the same fares to all nations. One roadblock was clear.




Selecting Panama

The next question was where to build. FERDINAND DE LESSUPS, the same engineer who designed the SUEZ CANAL, had organized a French attempt in Panama in the 1870s. Disease and financial problems left a partially built canal behind. While it made sense that the United States should buy the rights to complete the effort, Panama posed other problems. Despite being the most narrow nation in the region, Panama was very mountainous, and a complex series of locks was necessary to move ships across the isthmus. Nicaragua was another possibility. The canal would be situated closer to the United States. The terrain was flatter, and despite Nicaragua's width, there were numerous lakes that could be connected. Volcanic activity in Nicaragua prompted the United States to try to buy the territory in Panama.



But Panama was not an independent state. To obtain the rights to the territory, the United States had to negotiate with Colombia. The 1903 HAY-HERRAN TREATY permitted the United States to lease a six-mile wide strip of land at an annual fee. The treaty moved through the United States Senate, but the Colombian Senate held out for more money. Roosevelt was furious. Determined to build his canal, Roosevelt sent a U.S. gunboat to the shores of Colombia. At the same time, a group of "revolutionaries" declared independence in Panama. The Colombians were powerless to stop the uprising. The United States became the first nation in the world to recognize the new government of Panama. Within weeks, the HAY–BUNAU-VARILLA TREATY awarded a 10-mile strip of land to the United States, and the last hurdle was cleared.


In 1914, at the cost of $345 million, the PANAMA CANAL was open for business.
