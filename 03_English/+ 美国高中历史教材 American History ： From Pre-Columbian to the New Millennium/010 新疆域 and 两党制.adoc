== 新疆域 and 两党制

`主` #The years# of the early republic, *from* the end of the Revolutionary war in 1783 *to* the end of what is sometimes called the SECOND WAR FOR AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE in 1815,  `谓`  #had [itself] been# a period of enormous change that included _dramatic political innovations_ of _state and federal constitutions_ as well as the surge of western settlement.

[.my2]
早期共和国时期，从 1783 年独立战争结束到 1815 年有时被称为第二次美国独立战争结束，它本身就是一个巨大变革的时期，包括州和联邦宪法的巨大政治创新, 以及西方定居点的激增。

.had itself been ...
注意: 这并不是倒装结构。

"had been" 是过去完成时，表示在1815年之前的那段时间里发生的变化。
"itself" 用来强调早期共和国时期本身。 +
因此，"The years of the early republic... had itself been a period of enormous change" 强调了早期共和国时期（1783年到1815年）本身是一个充满巨大变化的时期，包括戏剧性的政治创新和西部定居的激增。

这个形式通过强调“itself”来突出那个特定时期的重要性和特殊性。

The Louisiana Purchase would go on to be a defining moment 决定性时刻 in the Jefferson presidency, one steeped 浸泡，浸透 in partisan （对某个人、团体或思想）过分支持的，偏护的，盲目拥护的 controversy 争论，争议.

1803 年，托马斯·杰斐逊 (Thomas Jefferson) 总统促成了购买"路易斯安那州"的交易，该交易使美国的面积几乎增加了一倍，并引发了关于奴隶制未来的分歧性辩论。联邦党人大多持反对态度。一些人以宪法为由不同意，另一些人认为法国对路易斯安那领土的主张是非法的，还有一些人担心新获得的领土, 会扩大奴隶主阶级在政府中的权力、影响力和代表权。路易斯安那购买案, 将继续成为杰斐逊总统任期内的一个决定性时刻，这一时刻充满了党派争议。

In 1790 the fast-growing population of the United States was 3.9 million, but only 5% of Americans lived west of the Appalachian Mountains that run from Maine to Georgia. +
By 1820, however, the total U.S. population had already reached 9.6 million and fully 25 percent of them lived west of the Appalachians in nine new states and three territories （美国）准州.

[.my2]
1790 年，美国人口快速增长，达到 390 万，但只有 5% 的美国人, 居住在从"缅因州"到"佐治亚州"的"阿巴拉契亚山脉"以西。然而，到 1820 年，美国总人口已达到 960 万 (30年后就翻了两倍多?!)，其中 25% 居住在"阿巴拉契亚山脉"以西的 9 个新州和 3 个领地。

[.my2]
当时的大多数政治家认为，共和国的健康发展, 取决于为普通美国白人提供负担得起的土地。在杰斐逊派共和党人中, 最受欢迎的政策, 是鼓励西部发展的扩张主义议程。这对于巩固民主共和党在南部和西部的实力, 发挥了重要作用。

That plan *took on* 呈现，具有（特征、外观等） new importance /once the United States had acquired the huge new territory from France.

[.my2]
甚至在杰斐逊完成购买路易斯安那之前，他就已经开始计划一次大胆的旅行，探索美国公民完全不知道的北美广阔内陆地区。一旦美国从法国手中获得了巨大的新领土，该计划就变得更加重要。

=== 美国应对欧洲的英法战争

While western movement and policies were reshaping the republic, European wars also presented 正式介绍；引见;使发生；使经历 a major challenge to the new country. +
The NAPOLEONIC WARS (1802-1815) were a continuation of the conflict begun in the 1790s when Great Britain led a coalition 联合体，联盟 of European powers against Revolutionary France, though 虽然，尽管 France was now led by the brilliant 很好的；杰出的 military strategist 战略家 Napoleon Bonaparte. +

As had also been true in the 1790s, neither 两者都不 European superpower `谓` respected the neutrality 中立，中立状态 of the United States. +
Instead, both tried to prevent U.S. ships from carrying goods to their enemy. +
Both Britain and France imposed BLOCKADES （尤指对港口的）包围，封锁 to limit American merchants, though 虽然，尽管；可是，不过 the dominant 占支配地位的，占优势的 British navy was clearly more successful.

[.my2]
在"西进运动"和"政策重塑共和国"的同时，欧洲战争也给这个新国家带来了重大挑战。拿破仑战争（1802-1815）是 1790 年代开始的冲突的延续，当时, 英国领导欧洲列强联盟, 对抗大革命后的法国，尽管法国当时在由杰出的军事战略家拿破仑·波拿巴领导。但正如 1790 年代的情况一样，两个欧洲超级大国, 也都不尊重美国的中立性。相反，双方都试图阻止美国船只向敌人运送货物。英国和法国都实施封锁, 来限制美国商人(与敌国做生意)，尽管占主导地位的英国海军显然更成功。

*In response to* this denial  否认；拒绝接受 of American sovereignty 主权；最高统治权；最高权威, President Jefferson and his secretary of state James Madison crafted _an imaginative 富于想象力的，创新的, but fundamentally 从根本上说，基本上 flawed 有瑕疵的，有缺陷的, policy_ of economic coercion 强迫；胁迫. +
Their EMBARGO 禁止贸易令；禁运 OF 1807 prevented U.S. ships from any trade with Europe in the belief that dependence 依赖，依靠 on American goods would soon force France and England to honor American neutrality. +

The plan backfired, however, as the Republican leaders failed to understand *how deeply committed (a.)忠于（某个人、机构等）；全心全意投入（工作、活动等）;做出（错或非法的事）；犯（罪或错等） the superpowers were* /to carrying on 继续做，从事 their war despite its high costs.

[.my2]
为了回应这种对美国主权的否定，杰斐逊总统和他的国务卿詹姆斯·麦迪逊, 制定了一项富有想象力, 但存在根本缺陷的"经济胁迫政策"。 1807 年发布禁运政策, 禁止美国船只与欧洲进行任何贸易，因为他们相信, 英法对美国商品的依赖, 很快就会迫使法国和英国尊重美国的中立性。然而，该计划却适得其反，因为共和党领导人未能理解到, 那些超级大国尽管会付出高昂成本，但它们依然坚定地致力于进行战争。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.how deeply committed the superpowers were
这句的正常语序, 其实是这样的: the superpowers `系` were `表`  how deeply committed.

**当引入“how”来强调程度, 并引导感叹句或间接疑问句时，通常会把形容词短语 “deeply committed” 放在主语之前，这使得结构看起来像倒装句。**

这种部分倒装结构, 是为了强调“how deeply committed”这个短语，使整个句子更有力地表达出超级大国对于继续战争的坚定承诺。

.commit
[ V] ~ (to sb/sth): to be completely loyal to one person, organization, etc. or give all your time and effort to your work, an activity, etc.忠于（某个人、机构等）；全心全意投入（工作、活动等） +
• Why are so many men scared to commit (v.)? (= say they will be loyal to one person) 为什么有这么多的男人, 害怕许诺忠诚于人？

The Embargo 禁运，贸易禁运 not only failed diplomatically 在外交上, but also caused enormous domestic 国内的 dissent （与官方的）不同意见，异议. +
American shippers, who were primarily 主要地；根本地 concentrated in Federalist (a.n.)联邦党 New England, generally circumvented (v.)规避，避开,绕行 the unpopular law. +

Its toll （战争、灾难等造成的）毁坏；伤亡人数 was clearly /marked in the sharp decline 下降，衰退 of American imports #from# _108 million dollars worth_ of goods in 1806 #to# just 22 million in 1808. +
This unsuccessful diplomatic strategy that mostly punished Americans 伴随状 helped to spur (v.)激励，鼓励；促进，加速 a Federalist revival (复兴，复苏)联邦党人的复兴 in the elections of 1808 and 1812. +

Nevertheless 然而，不过, Republicans from Virginia continued to hold the presidency /as James Madison replaced Jefferson in 1808.

[.my2]
美国的禁运政策, 不仅在外交上失败，而且在国内引起了巨大的不满。主要集中在新英格兰"联邦党"的美国托运人, 普遍规避了这项不受欢迎的法律。其损失显而易见，美国进口的商品总值, 从 1806 年的 1.08 亿美元, 急剧下降到 1808 年的仅 2,200 万美元。这一不成功的外交策略, 结果变成主要惩罚了美国人自己，并且还在 1808 年和 1812 年的选举中, 促进了联邦党人的复兴。尽管如此，来自弗吉尼亚州的共和党人, 继续成功担任上了总统. +

Madison faced difficult circumstances in office with increasing Indian violence in the west and war-like 战争的；好战的；有战争危险的 conditions 状态；状况 on the Atlantic. +
These combined *to push him away* #from# his policy of economic coercion 强迫，胁迫 #toward# an outright 完全的，彻底的；公开的，直率的 declaration of war. +
This intensification 强化；加剧；激烈化 was favored by a group of westerners and southerners in Congress called "WAR HAWKS," who were led by HENRY CLAY of Kentucky.

[.my2]
麦迪逊在任期间面临着困难，西部印第安人的暴力事件不断增加，大西洋上的战争局势也如火如荼。这些因素结合在一起，促使他放弃经济胁迫政策(禁运政策)，转向彻底宣战。这种强化行动, 受到国会中一群西方人和南方人的支持，他们被称为“战争鹰派”，由肯塔基州的亨利·克莱领导。


Most historians now agree that the WAR OF 1812 was "a western war with eastern labels." By this they mean that the real causes of the war stemmed from desire for control of western Indian lands and clear access to trade through New Orleans. +
Further, the issue of _national sovereignty_ 国家主权, so clearly denied by British rejection of _American free trade on the Atlantic_, provided a more honorable rationale 基本原理；根本原因 for war. +

Even with _the intense pressure_ of the War Hawks, the United States entered the war hesitantly 迟疑地；踌躇地 and with especially strong opposition from Federalist New England 新英格兰的联邦党人. +
When Congress declared war in June 1812, its heavily divided (v.) votes (19 to 13 in the Senate /and 79 to 49 in the House) suggest that the republic entered the war as a divided nation.

[.my2]
现在大多数历史学家都认为,  1812 年战争是“一场带有东方标签的西方战争”。他们的意思是，战争的真正原因源于对"控制印第安西部土地"和"通过新奥尔良进行贸易"的明确愿望的渴望。此外，英国拒绝美国在大西洋上的自由贸易, 明确否认了美国国家主权问题，这为战争提供了更光荣的理由。尽管面临战争鹰派的强大压力，但美国仍犹豫不决地参战，尤其是"联邦党"新英格兰的强烈反对。当国会于 1812 年 6 月宣战时，其投票结果分歧严重（参议院的投票是 19 比 13，众议院的投票是 79 比 49）, 这表明出, 共和国是作为一个意见分裂的国家而参战的。

.War of 1812–1815
又称美国第二次独立战争. 是美国方同盟, 与英国方同盟之间发生于1812年-1815年的战争。

开战原因: 美国声称大英帝国在以下三个方面侵犯其主权：

- 英国不遵守美国独立战争后双方1783年达成的巴黎条约：拒绝移交西部地区军事要塞，并且武装印地安人，威胁美国的西部边陲。
- 皇家海军拦截美国商船追捕逃兵，强征美国海员入伍——这些人虽然出生于英国，但已归化为美国公民。
- 英法之间的拿破仑战争导致的贸易禁运，使上百艘美国商船被皇家海军扣押，美国的中立国地位未被尊重。

1812年6月18日，詹姆斯·麦迪逊总统向国会发表演讲后，国会投票宣战。

同时, 美国独立战争结束后，英美之间的主权之争并未停止。作为英国殖民地的加拿大省，人口稀少，防御松懈。此时英国正与法军交战，无暇顾及美洲事务，美国欲乘机向北扩张，并且期待加拿大居民将美国军队视为解放者。 +
1812年，美国卸任总统托马斯·杰斐逊说：“今年将加拿大地区兼并，包括魁北克，只要向前进，向哈利法克斯进攻，最终将英国势力彻底逐出美洲大陆。”美国必须控制整个北美洲大陆的信念, 后来被称为美国的“昭昭天命”。

===  第二次独立战争 War of 1812, (1812年 美英战争)


In the War of 1812 the United States once again fought against the British and their Indian allies. +
Some historians see the conflict as a Second War for American Independence.

[.my2]
1812 年战争中，美国再次与"英国及其印第安盟友"作战。一些历史学家将这场冲突, 视为"第二次美国独立战争"。

The U.S. Congress was far from unanimous （决定或意见）一致的，一致同意的 in its declaration of war. +

America's initial invasion of Canada (then ruled by England) in the summer of 1812 was repulsed 击退；打垮；驱逐 by Tecumseh and the British. +
Although Tecumseh would be killed in battle the following fall, the U.S. was unable to mount 准备；安排；组织开展 a major invasion of Canada because of significant domestic discord 不一致；不和；纷争 over war policy. +

Most importantly, the governors of most New England states refused to allow their state militias to join a campaign beyond state boundaries. +
Similarly, a promising young Congressman 国会议员；众议院议员 from New Hampshire, DANIEL WEBSTER, actually discouraged 阻拦；阻止；劝阻;使灰心；使泄气；使丧失信心 ENLISTMENT 征募，应征入伍 in the U.S. +
army.

[.my2]
美国国会在宣战问题上, 远未达成一致。 1812 年夏天，美国首次入侵加拿大（当时由英国统治），但被特库姆塞和英国人击退。尽管特库姆塞在次年秋天战死，但由于美国国内战争政策的严重分歧，美国无法对加拿大发动大规模入侵。最重要的是，大多数新英格兰州的州长, 拒绝允许本州民兵参加州界之外的活动。同样，来自新罕布什尔州的一位有前途的年轻国会议员丹尼尔·韦伯斯特, 实际上不鼓励应征入伍。


British military dominance 优势，支配地位 was even clearer in the Atlantic and this naval superiority 优越（性）；优势 allowed it to *deliver*  投递，运送 a shaming （使）感到羞耻；（使）丢脸；（使）相形见绌 blow *to* the fragile United States in the summer of 1814. +
With Napoleon's French forces failing in Europe, Britain committed more of its resources to the American war and in August sailed up the Potomac River to occupy Washington D.C. and burn the White House. +

On the edge of national bankruptcy 国家破产 and with the capital largely in ashes, total American disaster was averted (v.)防止，避免（危险、坏事） when the British failed to capture FT. MCHENRY that protected nearby Baltimore.

[.my2]
英国在大西洋上的军事统治地位, 比美国更加明显，这种海军优势, 使其能够在 1814 年夏天, 给脆弱的美国带来耻辱性的打击。随着拿破仑的法国军队在欧洲的失败，英国能够将更多的资源投入到美国战争中去. +
8月，英军沿"波托马克河"逆流而上，占领了华盛顿特区, 并烧毁了白宫。在国家破产的边缘，首都大部分化为灰烬，英国人未能占领"麦克亨利堡"，美国的彻底灾难才得以避免。麦克亨利保护了附近的"巴尔的摩港口"。

The most critical moment of the War of 1812, however, may not have been a battle, but rather a political meeting called by the Massachusetts legislature 立法机关；立法机构. +
Beginning in December 1814, 26 Federalists representing New England states `谓` met at the HARTFORD CONVENTION to discuss how to reverse (v.)颠倒；彻底转变；使完全相反 the decline of their party and the region. +

[.my2]
然而，1812 年战争最关键的时刻, 可能不是一场战斗，而是马萨诸塞"州立法机关"召开的政治会议。从 1814 年 12 月开始，代表新英格兰各州的 26 名联邦党人, 在哈特福德大会上举行会议，讨论如何扭转该党和该地区的衰落。尽管制造业蓬勃发展，走私贸易给该地区带来了财富，但“麦迪逊先生的战争”及其费用, 却让新英格兰人难以接受。

Holding this meeting during the war was deeply controversial 有争议的，引发争论的. +
Although more moderate leaders voted down 投票否决 extremists 极端主义者 who called for New England to secede (v.)退出，脱离（组织等） from the United States, most Republicans believed that the Hartford Convention was an act of treason 危害国家罪，叛国罪（如战时通敌）.

[.my2]
在战争期间举行这次会议, 引起了很大争议。尽管较为温和的领导人, 投票否决了"要求新英格兰脱离美国"的极端分子，但大多数共和党人认为, 哈特福德会议是一种叛国行为。

.哈特福德会议
哈特福会议, 是美国新英格兰的联邦党, 于1814年12月15日-1815年1月5日, 在康涅狄格州哈特福, 举行的一系列会议. +
**讨论他们对当时的1812年战争之不满，以及由于联邦政府的权力越来越大, 引起的政治问题。**尽管激进的联邦党人提出"新英格兰脱离联邦, 与英国单独媾和"的主张，但与会的"温和派"多于"激进派"，极端的提案不是辩论的主要焦点。

**该会议讨论, 取消在国会给予蓄奴州更多权力的"五分之三妥协"，以及要求"接纳新州、宣战, 和限制贸易法案, 需要获得国会三分之二的绝对多数同意"。**联邦党人还讨论了他们对1803年路易斯安那购地, 和《1807年禁运法案》的不满。但在会议结束几周后，安德鲁·杰克逊少将在"纽奥良"战役大胜的消息, 传遍了新英格兰，以致"联邦党人"失去信誉, 并于1824年解散.

.新英格兰
是位于美国大陆东北角、濒临大西洋、毗邻加拿大的区域。**新英格兰地区包括美国的六个州，**由北至南分别为：缅因州、新罕布什尔州、佛蒙特州、麻萨诸塞州、罗德岛州、康涅狄格州。*麻萨诸塞州首府"波士顿", 是该地区的最大城市以及经济与文化中心。*

*在18世纪，新英格兰是最早表现出从英国统治下独立意志的英属北美殖民地之一* ——尽管新英格兰地区在后来的英美之间的1812年战争时, 持反战态度。

9世纪，新英格兰在美国的废奴运动中扮演了重要的角色，成为了美国文学和哲学的发源地、最早组织起免费公共教育的地区。同时，它也是北美最早体现出工业革命成果的地区。

=== 美国的新疆域

The United States changed dramatically in its first half century. +

By 1821 eleven new states had been added from Maine to Louisiana. +

This geographic growth and especially the political incorporation 合并；公司，团体组织 of the new states demonstrated that the United States had resolved a fundamental question about how to expand. +
This growth not only built upon the Louisiana Purchase, but included military intervention in SPANISH FLORIDA which the United States then claimed by treaty in 1819.

[.my2]
美国在其独立后前半个世纪, 发生了巨大的变化。 1776 年，美国由十三个殖民地组成，聚集在东海岸。到 1821 年，从"缅因州"到"路易斯安那州"又新增了 11 个州。这种地理上的增长，特别是新国家的政治合并，表明美国已经解决了如何扩张的基本问题。这种增长不仅建立在购买"路易斯安那"的基础上，还包括对西班牙"佛罗里达州"的军事干预，美国随后在 1819 年通过条约, 声称对该地区拥有主权。

The new shape of the nation required thinking about the United States in new ways. +
For instance, a classic text on American geography in 1793 taught that the United States was composed 组成，构成（一个整体） of three basic divisions: northern, middle, and southern. +
But the 1819 edition of that same book included a new region because western states and territories needed recognition as well. +
By 1820, over two million Americans lived west of the APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS.

[.my2]
国家的新形态, 需要以新的方式来思考"何为美国"。例如，1793年一本关于美国地理的经典著作教导说，美国由三个基本部分组成：北部、中部和南部。但同一本书的 1819 年版包含了一个新地区，因为西部各州和领地也需要得到承认。到 1820 年，超过 200 万美国人居住在"阿巴拉契亚山脉"以西。

Starting in the north, they were NEW ENGLAND (New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut); the MID-ATLANTIC (New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania); the CHESAPEAKE (Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia); and the LOWER SOUTH (the Carolinas and Georgia). +

As people from these regions joined new immigrants to the United States in settling the west, they established additional distinctive regions that combined frontier conditions with ways of doing things from their previous places of origin.

[.my2]
美国生活中, 日益增长的地区特色, 是复杂的。殖民时期，东海岸已发展出四个"生活方式各异"的基本地区。从北部开始，它们是"新英格兰"（新罕布什尔州、马萨诸塞州、罗德岛州和康涅狄格州）；中大西洋地区（纽约、新泽西和宾夕法尼亚）；切萨皮克（特拉华州、马里兰州和弗吉尼亚州）；和下南部（卡罗来纳州和佐治亚州）。随着来自这些地区的人们, 加入"美国新移民在西部定居"的行列，他们建立了更多的拥有独特特色的地区，将"边疆条件"与"他们以前的原籍地的做事方式", 结合了起来。

Dramatically increased production, like that in the New England's textile mills 纺织厂, were key parts of the Industrial Revolution, but required at least two more elements for widespread impact. +

First, an expanded system of credit was necessary to help entrepreneurs 企业家 secure (v.)（尤指经过努力）获得，取得，实现 the capital needed for large-scale and risky new ventures （尤指有风险的）企业，商业，投机活动，经营项目. +
Second, an improved transportation system was crucial for RAW MATERIALS to reach (v.) the factories and _manufactured (a.)制造的，已制成的 goods_ to reach (v.) consumers. +

[.my2]
产量的急剧增加，就像"新英格兰"纺织厂的产量一样，是工业革命的关键部分，但至少还需要另两个要素, 才能产生广泛的影响。首先，扩大"信贷体系", 对于帮助企业家获得大规模、高风险的新企业所需的资金, 是必要的。其次，改善的交通运输系统, 对于能将原材料运动到工厂, 和将制成品运送到消费者, 是至关重要。州政府在鼓励新银行机构和大幅增加交通网络方面, 发挥了关键作用。后一种发展, 通常被称为"市场革命"，因为创造更有效的方式来运输人员、原材料和制成品, 至关重要。

亚历山大·汉密尔顿 (Alexander Hamilton) 领导的美国银行于 1791 年获得美国国会颁发的特别国家特许状。该银行取得了巨大成功，到 1805 年在八个主要城市开设了分行。尽管经济上取得了成功，但政府特许的国家银行仍然存在政治上有争议。结果，麦迪逊总统没有在 1811 年提交银行章程更新。19 世纪初期对经济发展的关键法律和政府支持最终来自州而非国家层面。当国家银行关闭时，州政府做出回应，在五年内创建了 200 多家州特许银行。事实上，信贷的快速扩张和银行经常不受监管的活动加剧了 1819 年的经济崩溃，导致了长达六年的萧条。资本主义经济的活力创造了快速扩张，但也伴随着高风险，包括定期出现经济急剧下滑。

===  宗教转型与第二次大觉醒 Religious Transformation and the Second Great Awakening


The American Revolution had largely been a secular 现世的；世俗的；非宗教的 affair. +
The Founding Fathers clearly demonstrated their opposition to _the intermingling 混合物 of politics and religion_ by establishing _the separation of church and state_ 政教分离 in the first amendment to the Constitution.

[.my2]
美国革命, 很大程度上是一场世俗事件。开国元勋们在宪法第一修正案中, 确立了"政教分离"原则，明确表明了他们对"政治和宗教混合"的反对。

In part because religion was separated from the control of political leaders, #a series of religious REVIVALS# 宗教复兴 swept (v.) the United States from the 1790s and into the 1830s 后定 #that# transformed (v.)使改变外观（或性质）；使改观 _the religious landscape_ of the country. +
Known today as the SECOND GREAT AWAKENING 第二次大觉醒, this spiritual resurgence (n.)复苏；复兴  `谓` fundamentally altered (v.) the character of American religion. +

At the start of the Revolution /the largest denominations （基督教）教派，宗派 were CONGREGATIONALISTS 公理宗 (the 18th-century descendants 后裔；后代；子孙;（由过去类似物发展来的）派生物 of Puritan 清教徒的 churches), ANGLICANS 圣公会 (*known* after the Revolution *as* Episcopalians （苏格兰和美国的）圣公会教徒), and Quakers. +
But by 1800, EVANGELICAL 福音的；福音派教会的 METHODISM
墨守成规；拘泥形式 and BAPTISTS 浸礼宗, were becoming the fasting-growing religions in the nation.

[.my2]
部分原因是, 宗教脱离了政治领导人的控制，从 1790 年代到 1830 年代，一系列宗教复兴席卷了美国，改变了该国的宗教格局。今天被称为"第二次大觉醒"的这种精神复兴, 从根本上改变了美国宗教的特征。革命开始时，最大的教派是公理会（清教徒教会 18 世纪的后裔）、英国"圣公会"（革命后称为"圣公会"）和"贵格会"。但到了 1800 年，"福音派卫理公会"和"浸信会", 成为全国快速增长的宗教。


The EVANGELICAL impulse at the heart of the Second Great Awakening `谓` shared some of the egalitarian (a.)主张人人平等的；平等主义的 thrust of Revolutionary ideals. +

Evangelical churches generally had a populist 平民主义的 orientation 方向；目标；定向;（个人的）基本信仰，态度，观点 that *favored* ordinary people *over* elites. +
For instance, individual piety (n.)虔诚 was seen as #more important# for salvation 得救；救世;（危险、灾难、损失等的）避免方式，解救途径 #than# the formal university training required for ministers in traditional Christian churches.

[.my2]
"第二次大觉醒运动"核心的福音派冲动, 与革命理想的平等主义推力, 有一些共同点。**福音派教会普遍具有民粹主义倾向，偏爱普通民众而不是精英。**例如，他们认为, "个人的虔诚"为比"传统基督教会牧师所需的正规大学培训", 对"个人得救"更为重要。

The Second Great Awakening marked a fundamental transition 过渡，转变 in American religious life. +
Many early American religious groups in the CALVINIST tradition had emphasized the deep depravity 堕落；邪恶 of human beings and believed they could only be saved through the grace of God. +

The new evangelical movement, however, *placed* greater emphasis *on* humans' ability to change their situation for the better. +
By stressing that individuals could assert 明确肯定；断言;维护自己的权利（或权威） their "FREE WILL" in choosing to be saved and by suggesting that salvation was open to all human beings, the Second Great Awakening embraced 拥抱；欣然接受 a more optimistic view of the human condition （某群体的）生存状态，处境. +

The repeated and varied revivals of these several decades helped make the United States a much more deeply PROTESTANT nation than it had been before.

[.my2]
第二次大觉醒, 标志着美国宗教生活的根本转变。美国早期的许多"加尔文主义"传统宗教团体, 都强调人类的深深堕落，并相信只有通过上帝的恩典才能得救。然而，新的福音派运动, 则更加强调"人类改善自身处境的能力"。通过强调个人​​可以在选择被拯救时维护自己的“自由意志”，并暗示拯救对所有人开放，第二次大觉醒对人类状况采取了更加乐观的看法。这几十年里反复出现的各种复兴, 使美国成为一个比以前更加坚定的新教国家。

Furthermore, these changes (n.) all `谓`  had _a direct impact_ on American political culture that attempted to *make sense of* 理解，弄懂（不易理解的事物） how these varied impulses (n.) had transformed the country.

此外，这些变化都对美国政治文化产生了直接影响，美国政治文化试图理解这些不同的冲击, 如何改变了这个国家。

[.my2]
美国政治的变化特征, 可以分为以1812年战争为间隔的两个时期。在战争之前的早期共和国，“共和主义”一直是指导性的政治价值观。尽管共和主义毫无疑问地攻击了殖民时代的贵族理想，但它也包含了对"等级制度和不平等等传统价值观的衰落, 对公共秩序构成了威胁"的深切恐惧。


While it seems surprising today, at the start of the early republic (n.)共和国，共和政体 /many people, and almost all public leaders, *associated* democracy *with* anarchy. +
In the early national period 后定 following the War of 1812, democracy began to be championed 拥护，支持，捍卫 as _an unqualified 完全的；绝对的；无保留的；无限制条件的 key_ to improving the country. +
The formerly widespread fear of democracy `谓` was now held only by small and increasingly isolated groups in the 1820s.

[.my2]
虽然今天看来令人惊讶，但在共和国早期，许多人，以及几乎所有公共领导人，都将"民主"与"无政府状态"联系在一起。 1812 年战争后的早期国家时期，"民主"开始被视为改善国家的绝对关键。 1820 年代，以前普遍存在的对"民主"的恐惧, 现在只存在于小规模且日益孤立的群体中。



Although a belief in democratic principles `谓` remains at the center of American life today, the growth of democracy in the early national period was not obvious, easy, or without negative consequences 负面后果. +
`主` The economic boom of the early Industrial Revolution `谓` distributed (v.) wealth 分配财富 in shockingly unequal ways that threatened the independence of WORKING-CLASS 工人阶级的 Americans. +
Similarly, western expansion `谓` drove (v.) increased attacks on Native American communities *as well as* the massive expansion of slavery.

[.my2]
尽管对民主原则的信仰, 仍然是当今美国生活的核心，但"民主"在建国初期的发展, 并不明显、容易，或"没有产生负面后果"(意思就是还是带来了一些"负面后果"的)。工业革命早期的经济繁荣, 以极其不平等的方式分配财富，威胁到了美国工薪阶层的独立性。同样，西部扩张导致对美洲原住民社区的攻击增加, 以及奴隶制的大规模扩张。

Finally, even within white households, _the promise 承诺，保证 of Jacksonian Democracy_ could only *be fully attained* 取得，得到，获得 by husbands and sons. +
`主` #The changes# (n.) 后定 American society underwent (v.)经验；遭遇 in the early national period, including many of its troubling problems, `谓` #created# a framework of modern American life that we can still recognize today.

==== Monroe Doctrine 门罗主义

The Monroe Doctrine is a United States foreign policy position that opposes 反对，抵制 European colonialism 殖民主义，殖民政策 in the Western Hemisphere. It holds that `主` any intervention in the political affairs of the Americas by foreign powers `系` is a potentially hostile act against the United States.
The doctrine was central (a.)在中心的；中央的;最重要的；首要的；主要的 to American grand strategy 大战略 in the 20th century.

[.my2]
门罗主义是美国反对欧洲在西半球殖民主义的外交政策立场。它认为，外国势力对美洲政治事务的任何干预, 都可能是针对美国的敌对行为。
这一学说是 20 世纪美国大战略的核心。


President James Monroe first articulated (v.)明确表达；清楚说明 the doctrine on December 2, 1823. At the time, `主` nearly all Spanish colonies in the Americas `谓` had either achieved or were close to independence. Monroe asserted 宣称；声称 that the New World and the Old World were to remain distinctly separate (a.)不同的；不相关的 _spheres of influence_ 势力范围, and thus `主` further efforts by European powers to control or influence _sovereign states_ 主权国家 in the region `谓` would be viewed as a threat to U.S. security. In turn, the United States would recognize and #not# interfere 干涉，干扰 with existing European colonies #nor# meddle (v.)管闲事；干涉；干预 in the internal affairs of European countries.

[.my2]
1823 年 12 月 2 日，詹姆斯·门罗总统首次阐述了这一学说。当时，几乎所有西班牙在美洲的殖民地, 都已经实现或接近独立。门罗声称，新世界和旧世界将保持明显独立的势力范围， 因此，欧洲列强控制或影响该地区主权国家的进一步努力, 将被视为对美国的威胁。安全。 反过来，美国将承认但不干涉现有的欧洲殖民地，也不干涉欧洲国家的内政。

Because the U.S. lacked both a credible 可信的；可靠的 navy and army at the time of the doctrine's proclamation 宣言；公告；声明, it was largely disregarded 不理会，无视 by the colonial powers. While it was successfully enforced (v.)执行 in part by the United Kingdom, who used it as an opportunity to enforce its own _Pax Britannica_ (Latin for "British Peace") policy, the doctrine was still broken several times over the course of the 19th century.

[.my2]
由于在该学说颁布时，美国缺乏可靠的海军和陆军，因此它在很大程度上被殖民列强所忽视。虽然英国在一定程度上成功地执行了这一原则，并以此为契机, 执行自己的大不列颠治下的和平政策，但该学说在 19 世纪仍然多次被打破。 +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Pax Britannica

Pax Britannica (Latin for "British Peace", *modelled (v.)模仿；仿照 after* Pax Romana) was the period of relative peace between the great powers. During this time, the British Empire became the global hegemonic 霸权的；支配的 power, developed additional informal empire, and adopted 采用（某方法）；采取（某态度） the role of a "global policeman".

Pax Britannica（拉丁语，意为“英国和平”，仿照罗马和平时期）是大国之间相对和平的时期。在此期间，大英帝国成为全球霸权国家，发展了额外的非正式帝国，并扮演了“全球警察”的角色。
====

The doctrine, however, met with tacit (a.)心照不宣的，不言而喻的，默示的 British approval. They enforced it tactically 战术性地；策略高明地 as part of the wider Pax Britannica, which included enforcement 执行，实施 of the neutrality of the seas. This was *in line with* 与……一致；符合……的计划、想法或期望 the developing British policy of laissez-faire 放任政策；不干涉主义 free trade against mercantilism 重商主义. Fast-growing British industry sought (v.) markets for its manufactured goods, and, if the newly independent Latin American states became Spanish colonies again, British access to these markets would be cut off by Spanish mercantilist 重商主义的 policy.

[.my2]
然而，这一学说得到了英国的默许。他们在战术上将​​其作为更广泛的大不列颠治下和平的一部分来执行，其中包括执行海洋中立。这符合英国正在发展的反对"重商主义"的自由贸易政策。快速增长的英国工业为其制成品寻找市场，如果新独立的拉丁美洲国家再次成为西班牙殖民地，英国进入这些市场的机会将被西班牙重商主义政策切断。


By the turn of the 20th century, however, the United States itself was able to successfully enforce the doctrine, and it became seen as a defining 确定…的界线；界定;最典型的；起决定性作用的 moment in the foreign policy of the United States and one of its longest-standing tenets 原则；信条；教义. The intent 意图；意向；目的 and effect of the doctrine persisted for over a century after that, with only small variations 变化，变动, and would be invoked by many American statesmen 政治家 and several American presidents, including Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, and Ronald Reagan.

[.my2]
然而，到了 20 世纪之交，美国本身已经能够成功地执行这一原则，它被视为美国外交政策的决定性时刻及其最悠久的原则之一。该学说的意图和效果在此后持续了一个多世纪，只有很小的变化，并被许多美国政治家和几位美国总统引用，包括尤利西斯·S·格兰特、西奥多·罗斯福、约翰·F·肯尼迪和罗纳德·里根。

After 1898, the Monroe Doctrine was reinterpreted by lawyers and intellectuals 知识分子 as promoting multilateralism 多边主义 and non-intervention. In 1933, under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the United States affirmed this new interpretation, namely through co-founding the Organization of American States. Into the 21st century, the doctrine continues to be variably

1898年后，"门罗主义"被律师和知识分子, 重新解读为提倡"多边主义"和"不干涉"。 1933 年，在富兰克林·罗斯福总统的领导下，美国确认了这一新的解释，即通过共同创立美洲国家组织。进入 21 世纪，这一学说继续受到不同程度的谴责、恢复或重新解释。

==== James Madison Jr. +
詹姆斯·麦迪逊 : 第四任总统 （1809年－1817年）

James Madison Jr. +
因在起草和力荐《美国宪法》和《权利法案》中的关键作用被誉为“宪法之父”。**因起草前十条宪法修正案，麦迪逊也被誉为“权利法案之父”。**第四任总统 （1809年－1817年）。

在华盛顿任期内，*麦迪逊反对财务部长亚历山大·汉密尔顿主张的中央集权。为了反对汉密尔顿，托马斯·杰斐逊和麦迪逊成立了"民主共和党"，与汉密尔顿的"联邦党"抗衡，成为国家第一对主要政党。*

1802年，"杰斐逊"和麦迪逊派"詹姆斯·门罗"**求购新奥尔良，该城控制密西西比河口，对美国边界农民十分重要。**

虽然拿破仑还想在"路易斯安那"和"圣多明戈"重建帝国，镇压起义，但最后将注意力转向欧洲。拿破仑政府不但出售新奥尔良，还把整片"路易斯安那"抛售。


[.my1]
====
.路易斯安那

購地所涉土地面積是今日美國國土的22.3%，與當時美國原有國土面積大致相當，因此使得當時美國的國土翻倍。路易斯安那購地, 對美國的西進運動起到了重大推進作用。

*當時"密西西比河"已成為美國"阿巴拉契亞山脈"以西農產品重要運輸渠道，而"紐奧良"則為該河之樞紐。*
====

当欧洲混战一团时，麦迪逊努力使美国中立，强调根据国际法的美国合法权利。伦敦和巴黎不屑一顾，形势在杰斐逊第二任恶化。拿破仑在奥斯特里茨战役大胜，变得咄咄逼人，希望通过禁运来屈服英国，导致经济双输。麦迪逊和杰斐逊决定对英法禁运，禁止美国与外国经贸往来。禁运导致双输，造成沿海经济困难。东北联邦党人杀回来攻击禁运，禁令在杰斐逊离任时结束。

禁运在全国，特别是东北引起反感，伤害了麦迪逊在党内声望。1800年后"联邦党"垮台，麦迪逊和杰斐逊主要对手来自党内竞争。

在麦迪逊就任总统前，国会取消禁运，但美国与英法关系还是有问题。在与法国贸易争执外，美国与英国核心争斗在于英国强制征兵。英国与法国打仗多年，耗资巨大，许多英国人被海军拉去服役，不少人逃到美国商船。为了追回逃兵，英国扣留了一些美国船只，逮捕水手，拉回海军，其中一些人不是英国人。





'''



==== 第二次独立战争  (1812年-1815年, 美英战争)

美国独立战争结束后，英美之间的主权之争并未停止。作为英国殖民地的加拿大省，人口稀少，防御松懈。此时英国正与法军交战，无暇顾及美洲事务，美国欲乘机向北扩张，并且期待加拿大居民将美国军队视为解放者。

1812年，美国卸任总统托马斯·杰斐逊说：“今年**将加拿大地区兼并，...最终将英国势力彻底逐出美洲大陆。**”

image:/img/012.webp[,95%]

美国声称大英帝国在以下三个方面侵犯其主权：

1.英国不遵守美国独立战争后双方1783年达成的巴黎条约：拒绝移交西部地区军事要塞，并且武装印地安人，威胁美国的西部边陲。 +
2.皇家海军拦截美国商船追捕逃兵，强征美国海员入伍——这些人虽然出生于英国，但已归化为美国公民。 +
3.英法之间的拿破仑战争导致的贸易禁运，使上百艘美国商船被皇家海军扣押，美国的中立国地位未被尊重。

1811年，美国众议院的鹰派议员鼓动战争。1812年6月18日，詹姆斯·麦迪逊总统向国会发表演讲后，国会投票宣战。

虽然战前双方之间已经有长期的外交纷争，但是战事爆发时，均未充分备战。**英国被拿破仑战争拖住，不得不将大部分精锐海陆武装力量部署在欧洲。**英国在北美的最高军事长官得到的指示是，克制进犯行动，以避免从欧洲和英国其他殖民地调兵增援。1812年，英国在加拿大的正规军只有5,004人，辅以加拿大民兵。*战争期间，英国对拿破仑的战争结束后, 才将大批战舰调往美国海域。*

美国方面也未做好战争准备。1812年，陆军正规部队只有不到12,000兵员。开战后，虽然美国国会批准扩军至35,000人，但是士兵多为志愿兵而且民众不热衷行伍，极度缺乏受过正规训练的军官，部队战斗力不足。

*英国派遣大量舰艇，对美国港口进行更为严厉的封锁，使英国可以从容地将大量陆军部队运送到美国海岸.* 一个重要战果是英国陆军于1814年8月24日攻占了美国首都华盛顿特区，并且焚烧了总统官邸（白宫）. +
这场战争是第一次、目前为止也是唯一的一次，使美国首都曾经被外国军队占领。


西部战场集中在"伊利湖"和"安大略湖"之间的"尼亚加拉河"一线，以及"圣劳伦斯河"和"尚普兰湖"地区，是1812年美军进攻的重点。**如果美军直扑圣劳伦斯河防线，占领"蒙特利尔"和"魁北克"城，那么英军的补给线就被切断，加拿大西部地区无法坚守。**但美军当时却集中军事行动在西线，可谓失策。

image:/img/014.png[,95%]

英裔加拿大人多数是美国独立战争后流亡加拿大的保皇派，传统上忠于英国王室；法裔加拿大人多是天主教徒，一向厌恶美国的反天主教情绪；二者共同反对美国企图占领加拿大。

The years of the early republic, from the end of the Revolutionary war in 1783 to the end of what is sometimes called the SECOND WAR FOR AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE in 1815, had itself been a period of enormous change that included dramatic political innovations of state and federal constitutions as well as the surge of western settlement.


'''

=== 向西开拓

The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 intensified AMERICAN MIGRATION to the west that was already well underway. Anglo-American settlement in the 18th century had largely been confined to the eastern seaboard. It made its boldest inroads where rivers allowed easy internal transportation. As a result the chief population centers of early North America were clustered on the coast or along its major inland waterways.

In 1790 the fast-growing population of the United States was 3.9 million, but only 5% of Americans lived west of the Appalachian Mountains that run from Maine to Georgia. By 1820, however, the total U.S. population had already reached 9.6 million and fully 25 percent of them lived west of the Appalachians in nine new states and three territories.


Most politicians of the era believed that the health of the republic depended upon providing affordable land to ordinary white Americans. Among Jeffersonian Republicans most popular policies was an expansionist agenda that encouraged western development. This played an important part in cementing the Democratic-Republican party's strength in the south and west.

These new transportation projects reshaped the American landscape, but the larger economic promise for most of the new western lands lay in the massive inland rivers of the Ohio, Tennessee, and Mississippi, all of which ultimately flowed south to New Orleans.



Even before Jefferson had completed the Louisiana Purchase, he had begun to make plans for a bold journey to explore the vast interior of North America that remained completely unknown to American citizens. That plan took on new importance once the United States had acquired the huge new territory from France.


While trying to find a route across the continent, they were also expected to make detailed observations of the natural resources and geography of the west. Furthermore, they were to establish good relations with native groups in an attempt to disrupt British dominance of the lucrative Indian fur trade of the continental interior.

=== 美国应对欧洲的英法战争

While western movement and policies were reshaping the republic, European wars also presented a major challenge to the new country. The NAPOLEONIC WARS (1802-1815) were a continuation of the conflict begun in the 1790s when Great Britain led a coalition of European powers against Revolutionary France, though France was now led by the brilliant military strategist Napoleon Bonaparte. As had also been true in the 1790s, neither European superpower respected the neutrality of the United States. Instead, both tried to prevent U.S. ships from carrying goods to their enemy. Both Britain and France imposed BLOCKADES to limit American merchants, though the dominant British navy was clearly more successful.

In response to this denial of American sovereignty, President Jefferson and his secretary of state James Madison crafted an imaginative, but fundamentally flawed, policy of economic coercion. Their EMBARGO OF 1807 prevented U.S. ships from any trade with Europe in the belief that dependence on American goods would soon force France and England to honor American neutrality. The plan backfired, however, as the Republican leaders failed to understand how deeply committed the superpowers were to carrying on their war despite its high costs.


The Embargo not only failed diplomatically, but also caused enormous domestic dissent. American shippers, who were primarily concentrated in Federalist New England, generally circumvented the unpopular law. Its toll was clearly marked in the sharp decline of American imports from 108 million dollars worth of goods in 1806 to just 22 million in 1808. This unsuccessful diplomatic strategy that mostly punished Americans helped to spur a Federalist revival in the elections of 1808 and 1812. Nevertheless, Republicans from Virginia continued to hold the presidency as James Madison replaced Jefferson in 1808.


Madison faced difficult circumstances in office with increasing Indian violence in the west and war-like conditions on the Atlantic. These combined to push him away from his policy of economic coercion toward an outright declaration of war. This intensification was favored by a group of westerners and southerners in Congress called "WAR HAWKS," who were led by HENRY CLAY of Kentucky.


Most historians now agree that the WAR OF 1812 was "a western war with eastern labels." By this they mean that the real causes of the war stemmed from desire for control of western Indian lands and clear access to trade through New Orleans. Further, the issue of national sovereignty, so clearly denied by British rejection of American free trade on the Atlantic, provided a more honorable rationale for war. Even with the intense pressure of the War Hawks, the United States entered the war hesitantly and with especially strong opposition from Federalist New England. When Congress declared war in June 1812, its heavily divided votes (19 to 13 in the Senate and 79 to 49 in the House) suggest that the republic entered the war as a divided nation.

===   War of 1812


In the War of 1812 the United States once again fought against the British and their Indian allies. Some historians see the conflict as a Second War for American Independence.

The U.S. Congress was far from unanimous in its declaration of war. America's initial invasion of Canada (then ruled by England) in the summer of 1812 was repulsed by Tecumseh and the British. Although Tecumseh would be killed in battle the following fall, the U.S. was unable to mount a major invasion of Canada because of significant domestic discord over war policy. Most importantly, the governors of most New England states refused to allow their state militias to join a campaign beyond state boundaries. Similarly, a promising young Congressman from New Hampshire, DANIEL WEBSTER, actually discouraged ENLISTMENT in the U.S. army.


British military dominance was even clearer in the Atlantic and this naval superiority allowed it to deliver a shaming blow to the fragile United States in the summer of 1814. With Napoleon's French forces failing in Europe, Britain committed more of its resources to the American war and in August sailed up the Potomac River to occupy Washington D.C. and burn the White House. On the edge of national bankruptcy and with the capital largely in ashes, total American disaster was averted when the British failed to capture FT. MCHENRY that protected nearby Baltimore.



Watching the failed attack on Ft. McHenry as a prisoner of the British, FRANCIS SCOTT KEY wrote a poem later called "THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER" which was set to the tune of an English drinking song. It became the official NATIONAL ANTHEM of the United States of America in 1931.



The most critical moment of the War of 1812, however, may not have been a battle, but rather a political meeting called by the Massachusetts legislature. Beginning in December 1814, 26 Federalists representing New England states met at the HARTFORD CONVENTION to discuss how to reverse the decline of their party and the region. Although manufacturing was booming and contraband trade brought riches to the region, "MR. MADISON'S WAR" and its expenses proved hard to swallow for New Englanders.

Holding this meeting during the war was deeply controversial. Although more moderate leaders voted down extremists who called for New England to secede from the United States, most Republicans believed that the Hartford Convention was an act of treason.


Federalist New England's opposition to national policies had been demonstrated in numerous ways from circumventing trade restrictions as early as 1807, to voting against the initial declaration of war in 1812, refusing to contribute state militia to the national army, and now its representatives were moving on a dangerous course of semi-autonomy during war time.

If a peace treaty ending the War of 1812 had not been signed while the Hartford Convention was still meeting, New England may have seriously debated seceeding from the Union.




The Americans were angry with the British for many reasons.

- The British didn't withdraw from American territory in the Great Lakes region as they agreed to in the 1783 Treaty of Paris.

- Britain kept aiding Native Americans.

- Britain would not sign favorable commercial agreements with the U.S.

- Impressment: Britain claimed the right to take any British sailors serving on American merchant ships. In practice, the British took many American sailors and forced them to serve on British ships. This was nothing short of kidnapping.

- In 1807, The British ship Leopard fired on the American frigate Chesapeake. Other American merchant ships came under harassment from the British navy.

- War Hawks in Congress pushed for the conflict.


LAKE CHAMPLAINNiagara

But the United States was not really ready for war. The Americans hoped to get a jump on the British by conquering CANADA in the campaigns of 1812 and 1813. Initial plans called for a three-pronged offensive: from LAKE CHAMPLAIN to Montreal; across the Niagara frontier; and into Upper Canada from Detroit.


The first American attacks were disjointed and failed. Detroit was surrendered to the British in August 1812. The Americans also lost the BATTLE OF QUEENSTON HEIGHTS in October. Nothing much happened along Lake Champlain and the American forces withdrew in late November.


In 1813, the Americans tried an intricate attack on Montreal by a combined land and sea operation. That failed.

One bright spot for the Americans was OLIVER HAZARD PERRY's destruction of the BRITISH FLEET on Lake Erie in September 1813 that forced the British to flee from Detroit. The British were overtaken in October defeated at the battle of the Thames by Americans led by William Henry Harrison, the future President It was here that the Shawnee chief, and British ally, Tecumseh fell.


Minor victories aside, things looked bleak for the Americans in 1814. The British were able to devote more men and ships to the American arena after having defeated Napoleon.

England conceived of a three-pronged attack focusing on controlling major waterways. Control of the Hudson River in New York would seal off New England; seizing New Orleans would seal up the Mississippi River and seriously disrupt the farmers and traders of the Midwest; and by attacking the Chesapeake Bay, the British hoped to threaten Washington, D.C. and put an end to the war and pressure the U.S. into ceding territory in a peace treaty.


All the while, support for the war waned in America. Associated costs skyrocketed. New England talked of succeeding from the Union. At the Hartford Convention, delegates proposed constitutional amendments that would limit the power of the executive branch of government.

So weak was American military opposition that the British sashayed into Washington D.C. after winning the BATTLE OF BLADENSBURG and burned most of the public buildings including the White House. PRESIDENT MADISON had to flee the city. His wife Dolley gathered invaluable national objects and escaped with them at the last minute. It was the nadir of the war.

But the Americans put up a strong opposition in Baltimore and蒙特利尔 the British were forced to pull back from that city. In the north, about 10,000 British army veterans advanced into the United States via Montreal: their goal was New York City. With American fortunes looking their bleakest, American CAPTAIN THOMAS MACDONOUGH won the naval battle of Lake Champlain destroying the British fleet. The British army, fearful of not being supplied by the British navy, retreated into Canada.


The War of 1812 came to an end largely because the British public had grown tired of the sacrifice and expense of their twenty-year war against France. Now that Napoleon was all but finally defeated, the minor war against the United States in North America lost popular support. Negotiations began in August 1814 and on Christmas Eve the TREATY OF GHENT was signed in Belgium. The treaty called for the mutual restoration of territory based on pre-war boundaries and with the European war now over, the issue of American neutrality had no significance.

In effect, the treaty didn't change anything and hardly justified three years of war and the deep divide in American politics that it exacerbated.



Popular memory of the War of 1812 might have been quite so dour had it not been for a major victory won by American forces at New Orleans on January 8, 1815. Although the peace treaty had already been signed, news of it had not yet arrived on the battlefront where GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON led a decisive victory resulting in 700 British casualties versus only 13 American deaths. Of course, the BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS had no military or diplomatic significance, but it did allow Americans to swagger with the claim of a great win.

Furthermore, the victory launched the public career of Andrew Jackson as a new kind of American leader totally different from those who had guided the nation through the Revolution and early republic. The Battle of New Orleans vaunted Jackson to heroic status and he became a symbol of the new American nation emerging in the early 19th century.

'''

=== 美国的新疆域

The United States changed dramatically in its first half century. In 1776 the U.S. consisted of THIRTEEN COLONIES clustered together on the eastern seaboard. By 1821 eleven new states had been added from Maine to Louisiana. This geographic growth and especially the political incorporation of the new states demonstrated that the United States had resolved a fundamental question about how to expand. This growth not only built upon the Louisiana Purchase, but included military intervention in SPANISH FLORIDA which the United States then claimed by treaty in 1819.

The new shape of the nation required thinking about the United States in new ways. For instance, a classic text on American geography in 1793 taught that the United States was composed of three basic divisions: northern, middle, and southern. But the 1819 edition of that same book included a new region because western states and territories needed recognition as well. By 1820, over two million Americans lived west of the APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS.

The growing regional distinctiveness of American life was complex. Four basic regions with distinct ways of life had developed along the eastern seaboard in the colonial period. Starting in the north, they were NEW ENGLAND (New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut); the MID-ATLANTIC (New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania); the CHESAPEAKE (Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia); and the LOWER SOUTH (the Carolinas and Georgia). As people from these regions joined new immigrants to the United States in settling the west, they established additional distinctive regions that combined frontier conditions with ways of doing things from their previous places of origin.




The newly settled western lands of this period can be grouped in several ways, but four basic divisions were most evident: the BORDER AREA (Kentucky and Tennessee, the first trans-Appalachian states to join the nation), the Old Northwest (Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois), the OLD SOUTHWEST (Alabama and Mississippi), and the TRANS-MISSISSIPPI RIVER WEST (Louisiana and Missouri).

The new shape of the nation reflected much more than just physical expansion. This period also witnessed dramatic economic and religious changes. A new capitalist economy enormously expanded wealth and laid the foundation for the Industrial Revolution that flourished later in the 19th century. The great opportunities of economic development also brought new hardships for many people, especially those who toiled as slaves under the startlingly new system of cotton slavery that boomed in the early 19th century.

A dynamic religious movement known as the Second Great Awakening also transformed the nation in this period. Although springing from internal spiritual convictions, the new character of American Protestantism in the early 19th century reinforced the modern economic and political developments that created the new nation by the end of the 1820s.

The United States had claimed political independence in 1776, but its ability to make that claim a reality required at least another fifty years to be fully settled. The War of 1812, however fitfully, had demonstrated American military independence, but breaking free of the economic and cultural dominance of Great Britain would prove to be longer and more complicated struggles. In 1823 when President Monroe declared that the entire western hemisphere is "henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers," it was a claim made without the power to back it up. Although his Monroe Doctrine became a central plank of U.S. foreign policy only at the end of the century, Americans had clearly fashioned a bold new national identity by the 1820s.

=== 早期工业革命

The transition from an agricultural to an INDUSTRIAL ECONOMY took more than a century in the United States, but that long development entered its first phase from the 1790s through the 1830s. The INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION had begun in Britain during the mid-18th century, but the American colonies lagged far behind the mother country in part because the abundance of land and scarcity of labor in the New World reduced interest in expensive investments in machine production.

The start of the American Industrial Revolution is often attributed to SAMUEL SLATER who opened the first industrial mill in the United States in 1790 with a design that borrowed heavily from a British model. Slater's pirated technology greatly increased the speed with which cotton thread could be spun into yarn.


The rise of WAGE LABOR at the heart of the Industrial Revolution also exploited working people in new ways. The first strike among textile workers protesting wage and factory conditions occurred in 1824.

Dramatically increased production, like that in the New England's textile mills, were key parts of the Industrial Revolution, but required at least two more elements for widespread impact. First, an expanded system of credit was necessary to help entrepreneurs secure the capital needed for large-scale and risky new ventures. Second, an improved transportation system was crucial for RAW MATERIALS to reach the factories and manufactured goods to reach consumers. State governments played a key role encouraging both new banking institutions and a vastly increased transportation network. This latter development is often termed the MARKET REVOLUTION because of the central importance of creating more efficient ways to transport people, raw materials, and finished goods.

Alexander Hamilton's Bank of the United States received a special national charter from the U.S. Congress in 1791. It enjoyed great success, which led to the opening of BRANCH OFFICES in eight major cities by 1805. Although economically successful, a government-chartered national bank remained politically controversial. As a result, President Madison did not submit the bank's charter for renewal in 1811. The key legal and governmental support for economic development in the early 19th century ultimately came at the state, rather than the national, level. When the national bank closed, state governments responded by creating over 200 state-chartered banks within five years. Indeed, this rapid expansion of credit and the banks' often unregulated activities helped to exacerbate an ECONOMIC COLLAPSE IN 1819 that resulted in a six-year DEPRESSION. The dynamism of a capitalist economy creates rapid expansion that also comes with high risks that include regular periods of sharp economic downturns.

The use of a STATE CHARTER to provide special benefits for a PRIVATE CORPORATION was a crucial and controversial innovation in republican America. The idea of granting special privileges to certain individuals seemed to contradict the republican ideal of equality before the law.

The most famous state-led creation of the Market Revolution was undoubtedly New York's ERIE CANAL. Begun in 1817, the 364-mile man-made waterway floMontreal伊利运河wed between Albany on the Hudson River and Buffalo on Lake Erie. The canal connected the eastern seaboard and the Old Northwest. The great success of the Erie Canal set off a canal frenzy that, along with the development of the steamboat, created a new and complete national water transportation network by 1840.


The American Industrial Revolution, concentrated in the northeast, would ultimately prove to be the most significant force in the development of the modern United States. This economic innovation sprung primarily from necessity. New England's agricultural economy was the poorest in the country and that helped to spur experimentation there. Meanwhile, the far more fertile southern states remained fully committed to agriculture as the central source of its wealth, here, too, dramatic changes created a wholly new economy that would have been unrecognizable to late-18th century Americans.

The slave-based TOBACCO ECONOMY that sustained the Chesapeake region was in deep crisis in the late-18th century and some Virginia leaders even talked about ending slavery. But technological innovations to process cotton soon gave new life to slavery, which would flourish in the new nation as never before.




This economic triumph, however, was accompanied by an immeasurable human tragedy. By 1820 all of the northern states had outlawed slavery, but the rise of cotton made the enormous profits of the slave system irresistible to most white southerners. Distinctive northern and southern sections of the United States were emerging with the former more urban and industrial and the latter more agricultural, but the new economies of each section were deeply intertwined. Not only did southern cotton feed northern textile mills, but northern insurers and transporters played a major part in the growth of the modern slave economy of the cotton south.

===  Religious Transformation and the Second Great Awakening


The American Revolution had largely been a secular affair. The Founding Fathers clearly demonstrated their opposition to the intermingling of politics and religion by establishing the separation of church and state in the first amendment to the Constitution.

In part because religion was separated from the control of political leaders, a series of religious REVIVALS swept the United States from the 1790s and into the 1830s that transformed the religious landscape of the country. Known today as the SECOND GREAT AWAKENING, this spiritual resurgence fundamentally altered the character of American religion. At the start of the Revolution the largest denominations were CONGREGATIONALISTS (the 18th-century descendants of Puritan churches), ANGLICANS (known after the Revolution as Episcopalians), and Quakers. But by 1800, EVANGELICAL METHODISM and BAPTISTS, were becoming the fasting-growing religions in the nation.


The EVANGELICAL impulse at the heart of the Second Great Awakening shared some of the egalitarian thrust of Revolutionary ideals. Evangelical churches generally had a populist orientation that favored ordinary people over elites. For instance, individual piety was seen as more important for salvation than the formal university training required for ministers in traditional Christian churches.


The Second Great Awakening marked a fundamental transition in American religious life. Many early American religious groups in the CALVINIST tradition had emphasized the deep depravity of human beings and believed they could only be saved through the grace of God. The new evangelical movement, however, placed greater emphasis on humans' ability to change their situation for the better. By stressing that individuals could assert their "FREE WILL" in choosing to be saved and by suggesting that salvation was open to all human beings, the Second Great Awakening embraced a more optimistic view of the human condition. The repeated and varied revivals of these several decades helped make the United States a much more deeply PROTESTANT nation than it had been before.



'''

=== 半个世纪后, 美国已与开国时大不一样了

The social forces that reshaped the United States in its first half century were profound. Western expansion, growing racial conflict, unprecedented economic changes linked to the early Industrial Revolution, and the development of a stronger American Protestantism in the Second Great Awakening all overlapped with one another in ways that were both complementary and contradictory.

Furthermore, these changes all had a direct impact on American political culture that attempted to make sense of how these varied impulses had transformed the country.

The changing character of American politics can be divided into two time periods separated by the War of 1812. In the early republic that preceded the war, "REPUBLICANISM" had been the guiding political value. Although an unquestioned assault on the aristocratic ideal of the colonial era, republicanism also included a deep fear of the threat to public order posed by the decline of traditional values of hierarchy and inequality.


While it seems surprising today, at the start of the early republic many people, and almost all public leaders, associated democracy with anarchy. In the early national period following the War of 1812, democracy began to be championed as an unqualified key to improving the country. The formerly widespread fear of democracy was now held only by small and increasingly isolated groups in the 1820s.



Although a belief in democratic principles remains at the center of American life today, the growth of democracy in the early national period was not obvious, easy, or without negative consequences. The economic boom of the early Industrial Revolution distributed wealth in shockingly unequal ways that threatened the independence of WORKING-CLASS Americans. Similarly, western expansion drove increased attacks on Native American communities as well as the massive expansion of slavery.

Finally, even within white households, the promise of Jacksonian Democracy could only be fully attained by husbands and sons. The changes American society underwent in the early national period, including many of its troubling problems, created a framework of modern American life that we can still recognize today.

'''

=== 两党制

The War of 1812 closed with the Federalist Party all but destroyed. The 1816 presidential election was the last one when the Federalists' ran a candidate. He lost resoundingly.

The 1818 Congressional election brought another landslide victory for Democratic-Republicans who controlled 85 percent of the seats in the U.S. Congress. James Monroe, yet another Virginian, followed Madison in the Presidency for two terms from 1817 to 1825. Although this period has often been called the ERA OF GOOD FEELINGS due to its one-party dominance, in fact, Democratic-Republicans were deeply divided internally and a new political system was about to be created from the old Republican-Federalist competition that had been known as the FIRST PARTY SYSTEM.


Although Democratic-Republicans were now the only active national party, its leaders incorporated major economic policies that had been favored by Federalists since the time of Alexander Hamilton. President Monroe continued the policies begun by Madison at the end of his presidency to build an American System of national economic development. These policies had three basic aspects: a national bank, protective tariffs to support American manufactures, and federally-funded internal improvements.
