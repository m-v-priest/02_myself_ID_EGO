=== The New Deal 新政


When America hit rock bottom, Americans expected bold leadership.

[.my2]
当美国跌入谷底时，美国人期待大胆的领导。

Herbert Hoover *was perceived 注意到；意识到；察觉到 as* doing nothing to help 无所作为 when the nation was in its darkest hour. +
When the votes were tallied (v.)计算（总的数目、成本等）；合计 in 1932, Americans made a strong statement 说明；说法；表白；表态 for change, and sent Franklin D. Roosevelt to the White House. +

Ironically, Roosevelt made few concrete 确实的，具体的（而非想象或猜测的）;混凝土制的 proposals during the campaign, merely promising "a new deal 协议；（尤指）交易 for the American people." The plan that ultimately emerged during his Presidency was among the most ambitious in the history of the United States.

[.my2]
**当国家处于最黑暗的时刻时，赫伯特·胡佛被认为没有采取任何帮助措施。 1932 年计票时，美国人发表了强烈的变革声明，并将富兰克林·罗斯福送入白宫。**具有讽刺意味的是，罗斯福在竞选期间, 几乎没有提出任何具体建议，只是承诺“为美国人民制定一项新政”。*在他担任总统期间最终提出的计划, 是美国历史上最雄心勃勃的计划之一。*

.Franklin Delano Roosevelt 富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福

image:/img/Franklin Delano Roosevelt.jpg[,30%]

第32任美国总统. +
从1933年至1945年间，连续出任四届美国总统，且是唯一连任超过两届的美国总统。 富兰克林·罗斯福的远房堂兄西奥多·罗斯福是第26任美国总统，故在中文世界经常称呼富兰克林·罗斯福为“小罗斯福”总统。

在1930年代经济大萧条期间，罗斯福推行新政以提供失业救济与复苏经济，并成立如公共事业振兴署（WPA）、国家复兴管理局（NRA）和农业调整管理局（AAA）等机构来改革经济和银行体系。虽然直到第二次世界大战爆发为止，美国的经济仍未能完全复苏，但是他所发起的一些计划，如"联邦存款保险公司"（FDIC）、田纳西河谷管理局（TVA）以及"证券交易委员会"（SEC）等，仍继续在国家的商贸中扮演重要角色。除此之外，在其任内设立的一些制度，包括社会安全系统和全国劳资关系委员会（NLRB）等等，仍然保留至今。

1945年4月12日，罗斯福因脑溢血在佐治亚州逝世，死后由当时的美国副总统哈里·杜鲁门接任美国总统。 +
罗斯福被认为是美国历史上最伟大的总统之一.

==== A Bank Holiday 银行假期 (稳定金融业的挤兑风险)



In days past, depositing (v.)将（钱）存入银行；存储 money in a _savings account_ 储蓄账户 carried a degree of RISK. +
If a bank made bad investments and was forced to close, `主` individuals who did not withdraw their money fast enough `谓` found themselves out of luck 运气不好. +
Sometimes a simple rumor could force a bank to close. +
When DEPOSITORS 储户；存户 feared a bank was unsound 不健全的；不健康的;破旧的；摇摇欲坠的 and began removing their funds, the news would often spread to other customers. +
This often caused a panic 惊恐；恐慌, leading people to leave their homes and workplaces to get their money before it was too late.

[.my2]
过去，将钱存入银行的储蓄账户, 存在一定程度的风险。如果一家银行投资不当, 而被迫关闭，那些提款速度不够快的人, 就会发现自己运气不佳。有时，一个简单的谣言, 就可能迫使银行关门。当储户担心银行不健全, 并开始提取资金时，这个消息往往会传播给其他客户。这常常引起恐慌，导致人们离开家园和工作场所去取钱，以免为时已晚 (银行挤兑)。

These runs (n.)（到银行）挤提，挤兑 on banks were widespread during the early days of the Great Depression. +
In 1929 alone, 659 banks closed their doors.

Roosevelt, unlike Hoover, was quick to act.
Two days after taking the oath  誓言，誓约 of office, Roosevelt declared a "BANK HOLIDAY." From March 6 to March 10, banking transactions （一笔）交易，业务，买卖;办理；处理 were suspended  (v.)悬挂；停止，暂停 across the nation *except for* making change 换零钱. +

During this period, Roosevelt *presented* the new Congress *with* the EMERGENCY BANKING ACT. +
The law *empowered* the President *through* the TREASURY DEPARTMENT to reopen (v.) banks that were solvent (a.)有偿付能力；无债务 /and assist (v.)帮助；协助；援助 those that were not. +
The House allowed only forty minutes of debate before passing the law unanimously 全体一致地,无异议地, and the Senate soon followed with overwhelming support.

[.my2]
**与胡佛不同，罗斯福行动迅速。**宣誓就职两天后，罗斯福宣布“银行假期”。 3月6日至10日，全国银行除找零外, 都暂停交易。在此期间，**罗斯福向新国会提交了《紧急银行法》。该法律授权总统通过"财政部", 重新开放有偿付能力的银行, 并协助那些没有偿付能力的银行。**众议院只允许进行四十分钟的辩论，然后一致通过该法律，参议院很快就获得了压倒性的支持。

Banks were divided into four categories （人或事物的）类别，种类. +
Surprisingly, slightly over half the nation's banks *were deemed* 认为；视为；相信 first category and fit to reopen. +
The second category of banks was permitted 允许；（使）有可能；批准 to allow a percentage of its deposits to be withdrawn. +
The third category *consisted of* banks that were on the brink of collapse.  +
When the holiday was ended, these banks were only permitted to accept deposits. +
Five percent of banks were in the final category — unfit to continue business.

[.my2]
*银行分为四类。令人惊讶的是，全国一半以上的银行, 被视为第一类银行，适合重新开业。第二类银行被允许"提取一定比例的存款"。第三类是"濒临倒闭的银行"。假期结束后，这些银行只允许接受存款。百分之五的银行属于最后一类——不适合继续经营。*

On the Sunday evening before the banks reopened, Roosevelt addressed the nation through one of his signature (a.n.)明显特征；鲜明特色；识别标志;标志性的，惯有的 "FIRESIDE CHATS." With honest words in soothing tones, the President assured (v.) sixty million radio listeners that the crisis was over and the nation's banks were secure. +

On the first day back in business, deposits exceeded (v.)超过（数量） withdrawals. +
By the beginning of April, Americans *confidently returned* a billion dollars *to* the banking system. +
The bank crisis was over.

[.my2]
**在银行重新开业前的周日晚上，罗斯福通过他标志性的“炉边谈话”, 向全国发表讲话。总统以舒缓的语气, 诚实地向六千万广播听众保证, 危机已经结束，国家银行是安全的。**恢复营业的第一天，存款就超过了取款。到四月初，美国人满怀信心地向银行系统, 返还了十亿美元。银行危机已经结束。


But the legislation was not. +
On June 16, 1933, Roosevelt signed the GLASS-STEAGALL BANKING REFORM ACT.
This law created the FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION 联邦存款保险公司.
Under this new system, depositors 储户；存户 in member banks 联邦储备银行之会员银行 were given the security 保护措施；安全工作 of knowing that if their bank were to collapse, the federal government would refund (v.)还；退（款）；偿付 their losses. +
Deposits *up to* 不超过，最多 $2500, a figure that would rise through the years, were henceforth 从此之后 100% safe. +
The act also restricted banks from recklessly 鲁莽地；不顾一切地 speculating (v.)投机；做投机买卖 depositors' money in the stock market. +
In 1934, only 61 banks failed .

[.my2]
但立法上,还没结束。 1933 年 6 月 16 日，**罗斯福签署了《格拉斯-斯蒂格尔银行改革法案》。该法创建了"联邦存款保险公司"。在这个新系统下，成员银行的储户可以放心地知道，如果他们的银行倒闭，联邦政府将退还他们的损失。**最高 2500 美元的存款（这一数字将逐年上升）从此是 100% 安全的。**该法案还限制银行将储户的资金, 肆无忌惮地投机在股票市场上。 **1934年，只有61家银行倒闭。

Letters poured in to the White House from grateful 感谢的，感激的 Americans. +
Workers and farmers were thrilled (a.)非常兴奋；极为激动  that their savings were indeed now safe. +
Bankers *breathed a sigh of relief* 松了一口气 knowing that Roosevelt did not intend to nationalize (v.)使国有化 the banking system as many European countries had already done. +
Although radical 激进的，极端的 in speed and scope, Roosevelt's banking plan strengthened (v.) the current system, without fundamentally altering it. +
One of his advisors quipped (v.)讲俏皮话；讥讽；嘲弄；打趣, "Capitalism was saved in eight days."

[.my2]
心存感激的美国人, 纷纷给白宫写信。工人和农民很高兴, 他们的储蓄现在确实安全了。银行家们松了一口气，因为他们知道, 罗斯福并不打算像许多欧洲国家那样, 将银行体系国有化。尽管罗斯福的银行计划, 在速度和范围上都很激进，但它加强了现行体系，但没有从根本上改变它。他的一位顾问打趣道：“资本主义在八天内就被拯救了。”

==== Putting People Back to Work 让人们重返工作岗位


Out of work 失业 Americans `谓` needed jobs. +
To the unemployed (a.)未被雇用的，失业的, many of whom had no money left in the banks, `主` a decent job that put food on the dinner table `系` was a matter of survival.

[.my2]
失业的美国人需要工作。对于失业者来说，其中许多人银行里已经没有钱了，一份可以让餐桌上有食物的体面工作, 关系到生存。

Unlike Herbert Hoover, who refused to offer (v.) direct assistance to individuals, Franklin Roosevelt knew that the nation's unemployed could last (v.) only so long.
Like his banking legislation, aid would be immediate. +
Roosevelt adopted a strategy known as "*priming the pump* 投资以振兴（新的或不景气的企业或行业）." To start a dry pump, a farmer often *has to* pour (v.) a little into the pump to generate a heavy flow. +
Likewise 同样地，类似地, Roosevelt believed the national government could *jump start* 启动（汽车引擎）,重新启动或激活 a dry economy by pouring in a little federal money.

[.my2]
与"拒绝向个人提供直接援助"的赫伯特·胡佛不同，**富兰克林·罗斯福知道, 国家的失业者只能持续这么长时间。就像他的银行立法一样，援助将是立即的。**罗斯福采取了一种被称为“启动水泵”的策略。要启动干泵，农民通常必须向泵中倒入少量液体, 才能产生大量流量。同样，罗斯福相信, 国家政府可以通过注入少量联邦资金, 来启动干涸的经济。

[.my1]

.prime the pump
to encourage the growth of a new or weak business or industry by putting money into it 投资以振兴（新的或不景气的企业或行业）

• They had been primed (v.) with good advice. 他们事先得到了高人指点。

2.[ VN] to make sth ready for use or action 把（事物）准备好 +

The first major help to large (v.) numbers of jobless Americans was the FEDERAL EMERGENCY RELIEF ACT.
This law gave $3 billion to state and local governments for direct relief payments.
Under the direction of HARRY HOPKINS, FERA assisted millions of Americans in need. +
While 尽管，虽然 Hopkins and Roosevelt believed this was necessary, they were reticent (v.)寡言少语；不愿与人交谈；有保留 to continue this type of aid.
Direct payments might be "narcotic 致幻的；麻醉的;催眠的," stifling (v.)（使）窒息;压制；扼杀；阻止；抑制 the initiative 积极性；主动权 of Americans seeking paying jobs. +

Although FERA lasted two years, efforts were soon shifted to "work-relief" programs.
These agencies would pay individuals to perform jobs, rather than provide handouts 捐赠品；救济品.

[.my2]
对大量失业美国人的第一个重大帮助, 是《联邦紧急救济法案》。该法律向州和地方政府, 提供了 30 亿美元的直接救济金。在哈里·霍普金斯 (HARRY HOPKINS) 的指导下，FERA 帮助了数百万有需要的美国人。虽然霍普金斯和罗斯福认为这是必要的，但他们不愿继续提供此类援助。直接支付可能具有“麻醉性”，会扼杀美国人寻找有偿工作的主动性。尽管口交持续了两年，但工作很快就转向了“工作救济”计划。这些机构将向个人支付报酬, 以完成工作，而不是提供施舍。

.Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA)  联邦紧急救援署

是美国联邦政府1933年至1935年间的机构，其前身是由胡佛总统在1932年创建的"紧急救援署"（Emergency Relief Administration，ERA）。1933年5月，美国国会通过"联邦紧急救济法"，成立"联邦紧急救济署"。1935年，"联邦紧急救援署"被"公共事业振兴署"（WPA）代替。

"联邦紧急救援署"成立初期，将各种救济款物, 迅速拨往各州。第二年，*其主要目标由单纯救济改为“以工代赈”*，即通过在地方和州政府**创造新的非技术性工作, 以减轻家庭的失业。**尽管工作比直接支付现金，即所谓的“救济金”更昂贵，但**在心理上, 对于失业者的自尊是更有益的。(GDP不好时, 就搞基建. +
国家出钱来雇佣人民.)**

罗斯福新政的第一项措施，就是建立"平民保育团"（CCC）。**"平民保育团"是**从1933年到1942年间运作的**"以工代赈"计划，**专门吸纳年龄在18岁到25岁之间的救济家庭中的未婚失业男性，**从事植树护林、防治水患、水土保持、道路建筑、开辟森林防火线, 和设置森林望塔等工程建设。**平民保育团为年轻男性提供了工作，救济了在经济大萧条时期难以找到工作的家庭。

**与此同时，在全国范围内开启了"自然资源保护项目"。**平民保育团第一批招募了25万人，在遍及各州的1500个营地劳动。九年间，先后有300多万青年参与了"平民保育团"，他们开辟了740多万英亩国有林区和大量国有公园。**平均每人每期干9个月，**月工资中拿出绝大部分作赡家费，*这样就在整个社会扩大了救济面和相应的购买力。*

在1933-34年冬季，面对持续的高失业率和公共福利问题，**联邦紧急救援署设立了"土木工程署"（CWA），作为一个注资4亿美元的短期项目, 为人们提供工作。**土木工程署提供的建设性工作，**主要是改善和建造建筑物和桥梁。**它结束于1934年3月，*为400万人提供了工作。*
====



The first such initiative began in March 1933.
Called the CIVILIAN CONSERVATION 保护，保存；节约 CORPS, this program was aimed at over two million unemployed unmarried men between the ages of 17 and 25. +
CCC participants 参与者 left (v.) their homes and lived in camps in the countryside. +

*Subject (v.)使臣服；使顺从；（尤指）压服 to* military-style discipline, the men built reservoirs 水库 and bridges, and cut _fire lanes_ （乡间）小路;车道 through forests. +
They planted trees, dug (v.) ponds, and cleared (v.) lands for camping. +
They earned $30 dollars per month, most of which was sent directly to their families. +

The CCC was extremely popular. +
Listless youths were removed from the streets and given paying jobs and provided with room and shelter.

[.my2]
第一个此类倡议, 始于 1933 年 3 月。该计划名为“平民保护团”，针对超过 200 万年龄在 17 岁至 25 岁之间的失业未婚男性。CCC 参与者离开家园，住在乡村的营地中。这些人遵守军事纪律，修建水库和桥梁，并在森林中开辟消防通道。他们植树、挖池塘、清理土地用于露营。他们每月赚 30 美元，其中大部分直接寄给家人。 CCC 非常受欢迎。无精打采的年轻人被从街道上赶走，并获得有薪工作，并提供房间和住所。

In the fall of 1933, Roosevelt authorized (v.)批准；授权 the CIVIL WORKS 土木工程 ADMINISTRATION 管理部门，行政部门. +
Also headed by Hopkins, this program employed 2.5 million in a month's time, and eventually *grew to* a multitudinous (a.)大量的；众多的 4 million at its peak.

[.my2]
*"新政"为失业者提供了很多其他机会。* 1933 年秋，罗斯福授权"土木工程管理局"成立。同样由霍普金斯领导的该项目, 在一个月内雇用了 250 万人，并最终在巅峰时期增长到 400 万人。

Earning $15 per week, CWA workers tutored (v.)教；任课；指导；进行单独（或小组）辅导；任…的私人教师 the illiterate 文盲, built parks, repaired schools, and constructed athletic (a.)体育运动的；田径运动的 fields and swimming pools. +

Hopkins *put* about three thousand writers and artists *on* the payroll （公司员工的）工资名单;（公司的）工资总支出 as well. +

There were plenty of jobs to be done, and while many *scoffed (v.)嘲笑，讥讽 at* _the make-work (n.)（占用人手的）无价值的工作；打发时间的无意义工作 nature_ of the tasks assigned, it provided _vital (a.)至关重要的，必不可少的 relief_ during trying (a.)令人厌烦的；难对付的 times.

[.my2]
CWA 的工作人员每周赚取 15 美元，他们为文盲提供辅导、修建公园、修缮学校、修建运动场和游泳池。有些人甚至得到报酬去耙树叶。霍普金斯大学还雇佣了大约三千名作家和艺术家。有很多工作要做，虽然许多人嘲笑分配的任务的工作性质，但它在困难时期提供了重要的缓解。

Americans of all skill levels `谓` were given jobs to match their talents. +
Most of the resources *were spent on* public works programs such as roads and bridges, but WPA projects *spread to* artistic projects too.

[.my2]
其中最大的救济计划是"工程进展管理计划"。 CWA 到期后，罗斯福任命霍普金斯领导 WPA，该机构在到期前雇用了近 900 万美国人。各种技能水平的美国人, 都获得了与其才能相匹配的工作。大部分资源都花在了道路和桥梁等公共工程项目上，但 WPA 项目也扩展到了艺术项目。


Before the advent 出现，到来，问世 of Social Security, many unemployed Americans were forced to seek food from shelters and soup kitchens.

Even *such* noteworthy (a.)值得注意的；显著的；重要的 authors *as* JOHN STEINBECK and RICHARD WRIGHT were hired to write (v.) regional histories. +
WPA workers *took* _traveling (a.)旅行（用）的；移动的 libraries_ *to* rural areas. +

Farmers faced tough times. +
While most Americans enjoyed relative prosperity 相对繁荣 for most of the 1920s, the Great Depression for the American farmer really began after World War I. +

When the stock market `谓` crashed in 1929 sending prices in an even more downward cycle, many American farmers wondered /if their hardscrabble (a.)艰难困苦的；贫困的；勉强维持的 lives would ever improve.

[.my2]
农民面临艰难的时期。**虽然大多数美国人在 20 年代的大部分时间里, 都享有相对繁荣，但美国农民的大萧条, 真正开始于第一次世界大战后。**在“咆哮的20年代”的大部分时间里，由于农产品价格下跌, 和购买昂贵机械的需要，美国农民陷入了持续的债务循环。当1929年股市崩盘，导致价格进入更大的下行周期时，许多美国农民都在想，他们艰苦的生活是否会得到改善。

The first major New Deal initiative `谓` aimed to help farmers attempted *to raise* farm prices *to* a level equitable (a.)公平合理的；公正的 to the years 1909-14. +
Toward this end, the AGRICULTURAL ADJUSTMENT ADMINISTRATION was created. +

*第一个主要的新政倡议, 旨在帮助农民试图将农场价格提高到1909 - 14年的公平水平。为此，创建了"农业调整管理局"。提高商品价格的一种方法, 是人为降低产量. +
简而言之，如果农民生产的生产较少，那么他们的农作物和牲畜的价格就会上涨。*

The AAA identified (v.) seven BASIC FARM PRODUCTS: wheat, cotton, corn 谷物，谷粒；玉米, tobacco, rice, hogs 猪, and milk. +
Farmers who produced these goods would be paid by the AAA to reduce _the amount of acres 英亩 in cultivation_ or _the amount of LIVESTOCK 后定 raised_ 增加，提高（数量、水平等）. +
In other words, farmers were paid to farm (v.) less!

AAA确定了七种基本农产品：小麦，棉花，玉米，烟草，大米，猪和牛奶。*生产这些产品的农民将获得 AAA 的补偿，以减少种植面积, 或饲养牲畜的数量。换句话说，农民得到了少耕的报酬!* (即反内卷)

[.my2]
新闻界和公众立即大声疾呼。为了满足美国农业协会的要求，农民们翻耕了数百万英亩已经种植的作物。为了达到补贴标准，宰杀了600万头生猪。在一个许多人失业、数万人挨饿的时代，这种浪费的屠杀, 被认为是亵渎神明的，是彻头彻尾的错误。

但在农业调整法案（AAA）下，农场收入确实增加了。在三年内，棉花、小麦和玉米的价格翻了一番。尽管对接受政府补贴存在疑虑，但农民们对该计划普遍持赞同态度。不幸的是，这份恩惠并没有传递到最低经济层面。租户农民和分地耕种者没有得到政府援助；补贴流向了地主。地主通常用这笔钱购买更好的机械设备，进一步减少了对农业劳动力的需求。事实上，大萧条和AAA使分地耕作在美国几乎告一段落。

美国农民面临的另一个主要问题是"抵押贷款"丧失"赎回权"。由于无力支付月供，许多农民的财产都被银行收走了。在中西部的玉米带，情况变得令人绝望。农民们集中资源, 来救助有需要的朋友。明尼苏达州和北达科他州, 通过了"限制农场丧失抵押品赎回权"的法律。自发组织的团体成立，以威胁讨债人。1933年4月，在爱荷华州的勒玛斯，一群愤怒的暴民, 把一位取消"抵押品赎回权"的法官打得奄奄一息。

丧失抵押品赎回权（英语：foreclosure），又叫断赎。就是指物件抵押人由于没有满足抵押品赎回期间，所需要满足的要求（通常是没有支付利息），遭到债权人的清偿要求，被迫清偿债务。从而丧失了物件赎回的权利。 +
例如，某人到当铺当了一块手表，当期6个月，但是六个月过去了，这个人便没有办法赎回手表了。当铺老板便可以将其手表自行处理。

同理，如果按揭购买房屋的业主，由于种种原因，在必须缴纳房屋贷款的期间，没有履行缴款义务，银行可能会根据相关条款，要求屋主“以房屋被收回”为理由，收缴其房屋作为断赎补偿。

[.my2]
罗斯福想要阻止这种疯狂的行为。1933年3月通过的《农业信贷法案》(FARM CREDIT ACT), 为许多有可能无法偿还的抵押贷款, 提供了再融资。弗雷泽-莱姆克农场破产法, 允许任何农民在六年内, 以法定价格回购失去的农场，利率仅为1%。尽管被宣布"违宪"，弗雷泽-莱姆克的大部分条款, 在随后的立法中被保留。

Many nations in Europe had already experimented with pension plans. +
Britain and Germany had found exceptional 杰出的；优秀的；卓越的 success. +

The American plan was a bit different in its design. +
SOCIAL SECURITY was described as a "contract 合同，契约 between generations." The current generation of workers would pay into a fund 缴纳基金 while the retirees 退休人员 would take in a monthly stipend （尤指神职人员的）生活津贴，薪俸；献仪. +
Upon reaching the age of 65, individuals would start (v.) receiving payments based upon the amount 后定 contributed (v.)增加；增进；添加（到某物） over the years.

[.my2]
**欧洲许多国家, 已经尝试了养老金计划。**英国和德国取得了非凡的成功。美国的计划在设计上有点不同。社会保障被描述为“代际契约”(现收现付)。当前一代的工人, 将向基金缴纳费用，而退休人员, 则每月领取津贴。年满 65 岁后，个人将开始根据多年来缴纳的金额, 领取付款。



Employees would have one percent of their incomes automatically deducted (v.)扣除 from their paychecks 付薪水的支票，薪水, a rate that was originally envisioned (v.)展望；想象 to reach (v.) 3%. +
Employers would also contribute for their employees. +
The plan was mandatory (a.)强制的；法定的；义务的 except for 除了，除去 individuals in exempted professions. +

Roosevelt and his advisers knew that the Social Security Act was not perfect. +
Like other experiments, he hoped the law would set the groundwork for a system that could be refined over time. +
Social Security differed from European plans in that it made no effort to provide universal health insurance. +
The pensions that retirees received were extremely modest — below poverty level standards in most cases. +
Still, Roosevelt knew the plan was revolutionary. +
For the first time, the federal government accepted permanent responsibility for assisting people in need. +
It paved the way for future legislation that would redefine the relationship between the American people and their government.

Collectively, observers called them the "ALPHABET AGENCIES."

[.my2]
进步的政客们, 看到他们最疯狂的梦想变成了现实。**大萧条创造了一种环境，联邦政府承担起责任来解决以前留给个人、州和地方政府的一系列社会弊病。如此大量的监管和参与, 需要对政府官僚机构进行大规模升级。政府部门和监管机构组成的舰队成立了 (即大政府)，**为新政计划提供服务。观察家将它们统称为“字母机构”。

While the CCC, CWA, and WPA were established to provide relief for the unemployed, the New Deal also provided a program intended to boost both industries and working Americans. +
The National Industrial Recovery Act contained legislation designed to spark business growth and to improve labor conditions. +
The National Recovery Administration attempted to create a managed economy by relieving businesses of antitrust laws to eliminate "wasteful competition." The NRA, like the AAA for farmers, attempted to create artificial scarcity with commodities. +
The hope was that higher prices would yield higher profits and higher wages leading to an economic recovery.

[.my2]
虽然 CCC、CWA 和 WPA 的设立, 是为了向失业者提供救济，但"新政"还提供了一项旨在促进工业和美国工薪阶层的计划。 《国家工业复苏法》包含旨在刺激商业增长, 和改善劳动条件的立法。"国家复苏管理局"试图通过免除企业的反垄断法, 来消除“浪费竞争”，从而创建一个受管理的经济。 NRA 与农民的 AAA 一样，试图用商品制造人为的稀缺性。人们希望更高的价格, 会带来更高的利润和更高的工资，从而导致经济复苏。


To avoid charges of SOCIALISM, the NRA allowed each industry to draw up a code setting production quotas, limiting hours of operation, or restricting construction of new factories. +

全国复兴总署的设立, 受到了工人们的欢迎。加入全国复兴总署的企业, 会将全国复兴总署的蓝色老鹰标志, 贴在商店的橱窗和包装上。虽然当时企业可以自愿选择是否加入全国复兴总署，但没有蓝色老鹰标志的企业往往会遭到抵制。

FDR was a President, not a king. +
His goals were ambitious and extensive, and while he had many supporters, his enemies were legion. +
Liberals and radicals attacked from the left for not providing enough relief and for maintaining the fundamental aspects of capitalism. +
Conservatives claimed his policies were socialism in disguise, and that an interfering activist government was destroying a proud history of self-reliance.

**罗斯福是总统，而不是国王。他的目标雄心勃勃，范围广泛，虽然他有很多支持者，但他的敌人也很多。**自由派和激进派, 因没有提供足够的救济和维持资本主义的基本方面, 而受到左翼的攻击。保守派声称他的政策是伪装的"社会主义"，干涉的激进政府正在摧毁自力更生的光荣历史。

Despite big numbers at the ballot booth, Roosevelt needed to temper his objectives with the spirit of compromise and hope that his plans were popular enough to weather criticism. +
Friends and enemies alike had to admit that FDR was a political genius.

[.my2]
尽管投票站的投票人数众多，**罗斯福仍需要以妥协的精神调整他的目标，并希望他的计划足够受欢迎, 以经受住批评。**朋友和敌人都不得不承认, 罗斯福是一位政治天才。

Despite his reelection landslide, Roosevelt's mainstream opponents gained steam in the latter part of the decade. +
Frustrated by a conservative Supreme Court overturning New Deal initiatives, FDR hatched a "COURT PACKING" scheme. +
He proposed that when a federal judge reached the age of seventy and failed to retire, the President could add an additional justice to the bench. +
This thinly veiled scheme would immediately enable him to appoint six justices to the high court.

[.my2]
尽管罗斯福在连任中取得了压倒性胜利，但他的主流对手, 在20世纪90年代后半段获得了支持。由于保守的最高法院推翻了新政的倡议，罗斯福感到沮丧，于是他策划了一个“打包法庭”计划。他提议，当一名联邦法官到了70岁还没有退休时，总统可以再增加一名法官。这个几乎不加掩饰的计划, 将使他能够立即任命六名最高法院法官。

Conservative Democrats and Republicans charged FDR with abuse of power and failed to support the plan. +
During the 1938 Congressional elections, Roosevelt campaigned vigorously against anti-New deal Democrats. +
In nearly every case, the conservatives won. +
This COALITION OF SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS dominated the Congress until the 1960s and effectively ended the reform spirit of the New Deal.

[.my2]
*保守的民主党和共和党, 指责罗斯福滥用权力，并且不支持该计划。 1938 年国会选举期间，罗斯福大力反对"反新政"的民主党人。几乎在所有情况下，保守派都获胜。这个南方民主党和共和党的联盟, 一直主导国会直到 20 世纪 60 年代，有效地结束了"新政"的改革精神。*

=== The New Deal


When America hit rock bottom, Americans expected bold leadership.

Herbert Hoover was perceived as doing nothing to help when the nation was in its darkest hour. When the votes were tallied in 1932, Americans made a strong statement for change, and sent Franklin D. Roosevelt to the White House. Ironically, Roosevelt made few concrete proposals during the campaign, merely promising "a new deal for the American people." The plan that ultimately emerged during his Presidency was among the most ambitious in the history of the United States.




Radio advertisement

Radio's golden era coincided with Roosevelt's presidency. Radio shows entertained, advertised, and made an escape for American audiences. Roosevelt wisely used his weekly "Fireside Chats" to keep in touch with the populace.

Roosevelt had no grand strategy to fix the Depression. He was a bold experimenter. FDR liked to examine an idea and evaluate it on its philosophical merits. The details could be negotiated later. If it worked, fine. If not, he was more than willing to start over with a new plan. He surrounded himself with competent advisors, and delegated authority with discretion and confidence. As a master of the radio, his confidence was contagious among the American populace.

Before his first term expired, Roosevelt signed legislation aimed at fixing banks and the stock market. He approved plans to aid the unemployed and the nations farmers. He began housing initiatives and ventures into public-owned electric power. New Deal programs aided industrialists and laborers alike. His friends and enemies grew with every act he signed into law.

The NEW DEAL sparked a revolution in American public thought regarding the relationship between the people and the federal government.

==== A Bank Holiday



In days past, depositing money in a savings account carried a degree of RISK. If a bank made bad investments and was forced to close, individuals who did not withdraw their money fast enough found themselves out of luck. Sometimes a simple rumor could force a bank to close. When DEPOSITORS feared a bank was unsound and began removing their funds, the news would often spread to other customers. This often caused a panic, leading people to leave their homes and workplaces to get their money before it was too late.

These runs on banks were widespread during the early days of the Great Depression. In 1929 alone, 659 banks closed their doors. By 1932, an additional 5102 banks went out of business. Families lost their life savings overnight. Thirty-eight states had adopted restrictions on withdrawals in an effort to forestall the panic. Bank failures increased in 1933, and Franklin Roosevelt deemed remedying these failing financial institutions his first priority after being inaugurated.



Roosevelt, unlike Hoover, was quick to act. Two days after taking the oath of office, Roosevelt declared a "BANK HOLIDAY." From March 6 to March 10, banking transactions were suspended across the nation except for making change. During this period, Roosevelt presented the new Congress with the EMERGENCY BANKING ACT. The law empowered the President through the TREASURY DEPARTMENT to reopen banks that were solvent and assist those that were not. The House allowed only forty minutes of debate before passing the law unanimously, and the Senate soon followed with overwhelming support.

Banks were divided into four categories. Surprisingly, slightly over half the nation's banks were deemed first category and fit to reopen. The second category of banks was permitted to allow a percentage of its deposits to be withdrawn. The third category consisted of banks that were on the brink of collapse. When the holiday was ended, these banks were only permitted to accept deposits. Five percent of banks were in the final category — unfit to continue business.

On the Sunday evening before the banks reopened, Roosevelt addressed the nation through one of his signature "FIRESIDE CHATS." With honest words in soothing tones, the President assured sixty million radio listeners that the crisis was over and the nation's banks were secure. On the first day back in business, deposits exceeded withdrawals. By the beginning of April, Americans confidently returned a billion dollars to the banking system. The bank crisis was over.


But the legislation was not. On June 16, 1933, Roosevelt signed the GLASS-STEAGALL BANKING REFORM ACT. This law created the FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION. Under this new system, depositors in member banks were given the security of knowing that if their bank were to collapse, the federal government would refund their losses. Deposits up to $2500, a figure that would rise through the years, were henceforth 100% safe. The act also restricted banks from recklessly speculating depositors' money in the stock market. In 1934, only 61 banks failed .

Letters poured in to the White House from grateful Americans. Workers and farmers were thrilled that their savings were indeed now safe. Bankers breathed a sigh of relief knowing that Roosevelt did not intend to nationalize the banking system as many European countries had already done. Although radical in speed and scope, Roosevelt's banking plan strengthened the current system, without fundamentally altering it. One of his advisors quipped, "Capitalism was saved in eight days."


'''

==== Putting People Back to Work


Out of work Americans needed jobs. To the unemployed, many of whom had no money left in the banks, a decent job that put food on the dinner table was a matter of survival.

Unlike Herbert Hoover, who refused to offer direct assistance to individuals, Franklin Roosevelt knew that the nation's unemployed could last only so long. Like his banking legislation, aid would be immediate. Roosevelt adopted a strategy known as "priming the pump." To start a dry pump, a farmer often has to pour a little into the pump to generate a heavy flow. Likewise, Roosevelt believed the national government could jump start a dry economy by pouring in a little federal money.

The first major help to large numbers of jobless Americans was the FEDERAL EMERGENCY RELIEF ACT. This law gave $3 billion to state and local governments for direct relief payments. Under the direction of HARRY HOPKINS, FERA assisted millions of Americans in need. While Hopkins and Roosevelt believed this was necessary, they were reticent to continue this type of aid. Direct payments might be "narcotic," stifling the initiative of Americans seeking paying jobs. Although FERA lasted two years, efforts were soon shifted to "work-relief" programs. These agencies would pay individuals to perform jobs, rather than provide handouts.





The first such initiative began in March 1933. Called the CIVILIAN CONSERVATION CORPS, this program was aimed at over two million unemployed unmarried men between the ages of 17 and 25. CCC participants left their homes and lived in camps in the countryside. Subject to military-style discipline, the men built reservoirs and bridges, and cut fire lanes through forests. They planted trees, dug ponds, and cleared lands for camping. They earned $30 dollars per month, most of which was sent directly to their families. The CCC was extremely popular. Listless youths were removed from the streets and given paying jobs and provided with room and shelter.


There were plenty of other opportunities for the unemployed in the New Deal. In the fall of 1933, Roosevelt authorized the CIVIL WORKS ADMINISTRATION. Also headed by Hopkins, this program employed 2.5 million in a month's time, and eventually grew to a multitudinous 4 million at its peak.

Earning $15 per week, CWA workers tutored the illiterate, built parks, repaired schools, and constructed athletic fields and swimming pools. Some were even paid to rake leaves. Hopkins put about three thousand writers and artists on the payroll as well. There were plenty of jobs to be done, and while many scoffed at the make-work nature of the tasks assigned, it provided vital relief during trying times.

The largest relief program of all was the WORKS PROGRESS ADMINISTRATION. When the CWA expired, Roosevelt appointed Hopkins to head the WPA, which employed nearly 9 million Americans before its expiration. Americans of all skill levels were given jobs to match their talents. Most of the resources were spent on public works programs such as roads and bridges, but WPA projects spread to artistic projects too.


Before the advent of Social Security, many unemployed Americans were forced to seek food from shelters and soup kitchens.


The FEDERAL THEATER PROJECT hired actors to perform plays across the land. Artists such as BEN SHAHN beautified cities by painting larger-than-life murals. Even such noteworthy authors as JOHN STEINBECK and RICHARD WRIGHT were hired to write regional histories. WPA workers took traveling libraries to rural areas. Some were assigned the task of transcribing documents from colonial history; others were assigned to assist the blind.

Critics called the WPA "We Piddle Around" or "We Poke Along," labeling it the worst waste of taxpayer money in American history. But most every county in America received some service by the newly employed, and although the average monthly salary was barely above subsistence level, millions of Americans earned desperately needed cash, skills, and self-respect.

==== The Farming Problem


Years of plowing and planting left soil depleted and weak. As a result, clouds of dust fell like brown snow over the Great Plains.

Farmers faced tough times. While most Americans enjoyed relative prosperity for most of the 1920s, the Great Depression for the American farmer really began after World War I. Much of the Roaring '20s was a continual cycle of debt for the American farmer, stemming from falling farm prices and the need to purchase expensive machinery. When the stock market crashed in 1929 sending prices in an even more downward cycle, many American farmers wondered if their hardscrabble lives would ever improve.

The first major New Deal initiative aimed to help farmers attempted to raise farm prices to a level equitable to the years 1909-14. Toward this end, the AGRICULTURAL ADJUSTMENT ADMINISTRATION was created. One method of driving up prices of a commodity is to create artificial scarcity. Simply put, if farmers produced less, the prices of their crops and livestock would increase.

The AAA identified seven BASIC FARM PRODUCTS: wheat, cotton, corn, tobacco, rice, hogs, and milk. Farmers who produced these goods would be paid by the AAA to reduce the amount of acres in cultivation or the amount of LIVESTOCK raised. In other words, farmers were paid to farm less!



The press and the public immediately cried foul. To meet the demands set by the AAA, farmers plowed under millions of acres of already planted crops. Six million young pigs were slaughtered to meet the subsidy guidelines. In a time when many were out of work and tens of thousands starved, this wasteful carnage was considered blasphemous and downright wrong.

But farm income did increase under the AAA. Cotton, wheat, and corn prices doubled in three years. Despite having misgivings about receiving government subsidies, farmers overwhelmingly approved of the program. Unfortunately, the bounty did not trickle down to the lowest economic levels. Tenant farmers and sharecroppers did not receive government aid; the subsidy went to the landlord. The owners often bought better machinery with the money, which further reduced the need for farm labor. In fact, the Great Depression and the AAA brought a virtual end to the practice of sharecropping in America.


The Supreme Court put an end to the AAA in 1936 by declaring it unconstitutional. At this time the Roosevelt administration decided to repackage the agricultural subsidies as incentives to save the environment. After years and years of plowing and planting, much of the soil of the Great Plains had become depleted and weak. Great winds blew clouds of dust that fell like brown snow to cover homes across the region as residents of the "Dust Bowl" moved west in search of better times.

The SOIL CONSERVATION AND DOMESTIC ALLOTMENT ACT paid farmers to plant clover and alfalfa instead of wheat and corn. These crops return nutrients to the soil. At the same time, the government achieved its goal of reducing crop acreage of the key commodities.




Another major problem faced by American farmers was mortgage foreclosure. Unable to make the monthly payments, many farmers were losing their property to their banks. Across the CORN BELT of the Midwest, the situation grew desperate. Farmers pooled resources to bail out needy friends. Minnesota and North Dakota passed laws restricting FARM FORECLOSURES. Vigilante groups formed to intimidate bill collectors. In Le Mars, Iowa, an angry mob beat a foreclosing judge to the brink of death in April 1933.

FDR intended to stop the madness. The FARM CREDIT ACT, passed in March 1933 refinanced many mortgages in danger of going unpaid. The FRAZIER-LEMKE FARM BANKRUPTCY ACT allowed any farmer to buy back a lost farm at a law price over six years at only one percent interest. Despite being declared unconstitutional, most of the provisions of Frazier-Lemke were retained in subsequent legislation.

In 1933 only about one out of every ten American farms was powered by electricity. The RURAL ELECTRIFICATION AUTHORITY addressed this pressing problem. The government embarked on a mission of getting electricity to the nation's farms. Faced with government competition, private utility companies sprang into action and by sending power lines to rural areas with a speed previously unknown. By 1950, nine out of every ten farms enjoyed the benefits of electric power.

'''

==== Social Security



Social Security not only directly aided those who had retired and widows and orphans of insured workers, but it also encouraged states to provide more far-reaching social assistance programs.

PENSIONS for the retired or the notion of Social Security was not always the domain of the federal government. Individuals were expected to save a little of each paycheck for the day they would at last retire. Those who were aggressive enough to negotiate a pension plan with an employer were few indeed. The majority of working Americans, however, lived check to check, with little or nothing extra to be saved for the future. Many became a drag on the rest of the family upon retirement. The SOCIAL SECURITY ACT OF 1935 aimed to improve this predicament.

Many nations in Europe had already experimented with pension plans. Britain and Germany had found exceptional success. The American plan was a bit different in its design. SOCIAL SECURITY was described as a "contract between generations." The current generation of workers would pay into a fund while the retirees would take in a monthly stipend. Upon reaching the age of 65, individuals would start receiving payments based upon the amount contributed over the years.



Employees would have one percent of their incomes automatically deducted from their paychecks, a rate that was originally envisioned to reach 3%. Employers would also contribute for their employees. The plan was mandatory except for individuals in exempted professions. Roosevelt knew that this reform would be permanent. He guessed that once workers had paid into a system for decades, they would expect to receive their checks. Woe to the politician who tried to end the system once it was in place.

President Roosevelt signing Social Security Act
President Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law in 1935. Designed to pay retired workers age 65 or older a continuing income after retirement, this act helped Americans breathe easier about their futures.

A committee of staffers led by SECRETARY OF LABOR FRANCES PERKINS, the first female ever to hold a Cabinet position, penned the Social Security Act. In addition to providing old- age pensions, the legislation created a safety net for other Americans in distress. Unemployment insurance was part of the plan, to be funded by employers. The federal government also offered to match state funds for the blind and for job training for the physically disabled. Unmarried women with dependent children also received funds under the Social Security Act.

Roosevelt and his advisers knew that the Social Security Act was not perfect. Like other experiments, he hoped the law would set the groundwork for a system that could be refined over time. Social Security differed from European plans in that it made no effort to provide universal health insurance. The pensions that retirees received were extremely modest — below poverty level standards in most cases. Still, Roosevelt knew the plan was revolutionary. For the first time, the federal government accepted permanent responsibility for assisting people in need. It paved the way for future legislation that would redefine the relationship between the American people and their government.

==== FDR's Alphabet Soup


In addition to setting a minimum wage and the maximum hours a person could work in a week, the National Recovery Administration outlawed child labor.

The New Deal was clearly the most ambitious legislative program ever attempted by Congress and an American President.

Progressive politicians saw their wildest dreams come alive. The Great Depression created an environment where the federal government accepted responsibility for curing a wide array of society's ills previously left to individuals, states, and local governments. This amount of regulation and involvement requires a vast upgrading of the government bureaucracy. An armada of government bureaus and regulatory agencies was erected to service the programs of the New Deal. Collectively, observers called them the "ALPHABET AGENCIES."

While the CCC, CWA, and WPA were established to provide relief for the unemployed, the New Deal also provided a program intended to boost both industries and working Americans. The National Industrial Recovery Act contained legislation designed to spark business growth and to improve labor conditions. The National Recovery Administration attempted to create a managed economy by relieving businesses of antitrust laws to eliminate "wasteful competition." The NRA, like the AAA for farmers, attempted to create artificial scarcity with commodities. The hope was that higher prices would yield higher profits and higher wages leading to an economic recovery.


To avoid charges of SOCIALISM, the NRA allowed each industry to draw up a code setting production quotas, limiting hours of operation, or restricting construction of new factories. Once the President approved each code, pressure was put on each business to comply. A PROPAGANDA campaign reminiscent of World War I ensued. Firms that participated in the NRA displayed blue eagles reminding consumers of a company's apparent patriotism.



To enlist the support of LABOR UNIONS, the NRA outlawed child labor, set maximum hours, and required a MINIMUM WAGE. The greatest victory for labor unions was the guarantee of the right to collective bargaining, which led to a dramatic upsurge in union membership. Unfortunately, the NRA did little to improve the economy. The increase in prices actually caused a slight slowdown in the recovery. Workers complained that participating industries found loopholes to violate minimum wage and child labor obligations. When the Supreme Court finally declared the NRA unconstitutional in 1936, many had taken to calling it the "National Run Around."




The government blazed other new trails by creating the TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY in May 1933. The geography of the Tennessee River Valley had long been a problem for its residents. Centuries of resource exploitation contributed to soil erosion and massive, unpredictable floods that left parts of seven states impoverished and underutilized.

Funds were authorized to construct 20 new dams and to teach residents better soil management. The hydroelectric power generated by the TVA was sold to the public at low prices, prompting complaints from private power companies that the government was presenting unfair competition. Soon FLOOD CONTROL ceased to be a problem and FDR considered other regional projects.

There seemed to be no end to the alphabet soup. The SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) was created to serve as a watchdog on the stock market. The FEDERAL HOUSING AUTHORITY (FHA) provided low interest loans for new home construction. The HOME OWNERS LOAN CORPORATION (HOLC) allowed homeowners to refinance mortgages to prevent foreclosure or to make home improvements. The UNITED STATES HOUSING AUTHORITY (USHA) initiated the idea of government-owned low-income housing projects. The PUBLIC WORKS ADMINISTRATION (PWA) created thousands of jobs by authorizing the building of roads, bridges, and dams. The NATIONAL YOUTH ADMINISTRATION (NYA) provided college students with work-study jobs. The NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD (NLRB) was designed to protect the right of collective bargaining and to serve as a liaison between deadlock industrial and labor organizations.


Critics bemoaned the huge costs and rising national debt and spoon-feeding Americans. Regardless, many of the programs found in FDR's "alphabet soup" exist to this day.


'''

==== Roosevelt's Critics


FDR was a President, not a king. His goals were ambitious and extensive, and while he had many supporters, his enemies were legion. Liberals and radicals attacked from the left for not providing enough relief and for maintaining the fundamental aspects of capitalism. Conservatives claimed his policies were socialism in disguise, and that an interfering activist government was destroying a proud history of self-reliance.

Despite big numbers at the ballot booth, Roosevelt needed to temper his objectives with the spirit of compromise and hope that his plans were popular enough to weather criticism. Friends and enemies alike had to admit that FDR was a political genius.

Despite his reelection landslide, Roosevelt's mainstream opponents gained steam in the latter part of the decade. Frustrated by a conservative Supreme Court overturning New Deal initiatives, FDR hatched a "COURT PACKING" scheme. He proposed that when a federal judge reached the age of seventy and failed to retire, the President could add an additional justice to the bench. This thinly veiled scheme would immediately enable him to appoint six justices to the high court.

Conservative Democrats and Republicans charged FDR with abuse of power and failed to support the plan. During the 1938 Congressional elections, Roosevelt campaigned vigorously against anti-New deal Democrats. In nearly every case, the conservatives won. This COALITION OF SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS dominated the Congress until the 1960s and effectively ended the reform spirit of the New Deal.

=== An Evaluation of the New Deal


At the time of its construction during the Great Depression, the Hoover Dam was the largest in the world. To this day, it uses the power of the Colorado River to electrify the region.




How effective was the New Deal at addressing the problems of the Great Depression?

No evaluation of the New Deal is complete without an analysis of Roosevelt himself. As a leader, his skills were unparalleled. Desperate times called for desperate measures, and FDR responded with a bold program of experimentation that arguably saved the capitalist system and perhaps the American democracy. As sweeping as his objectives were, they still fundamentally preserved the free-market economy.

His critics charged that he abused his power and set the trend for an imperial Presidency that would ultimately endanger the office in future decades.


The New Deal itself created millions of jobs and sponsored public works projects that reached most every county in the nation. Federal protection of bank deposits ended the dangerous trend of bank runs. Abuse of the stock market was more clearly defined and monitored to prevent collapses in the future. The Social Security system was modified and expanded to remain one of the most popular government programs for the remainder of the century. For the first time in peacetime history the federal government assumed responsibility for managing the economy. The legacy of social welfare programs for the destitute and underprivileged would ring through the remainder of the 1900s.

Laborers benefited from protections as witnessed by the emergence of a new powerful union, the CONGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS. African Americans and women received limited advances by the legislative programs, but FDR was not fully committed to either civil or women's rights. All over Europe, fascist governments were on the rise, but Roosevelt steered America along a safe path when economic spirits were at an all-time low.

However comprehensive the New Deal seemed, it failed to achieve its main goal: ending the Depression. In 1939, the unemployment rate was still 19 percent, and not until 1943 did it reach its pre-Depression levels.

===== The New Deal 罗斯福新政

*新政”于1933年-1938年实行. 第二次世界大战爆发后，新政基本结束.* 但罗斯福新政时期产生的一些制度或机构如社会安全保障基金、美国证券交易委员会、美国联邦存款保险公司、美国住宅局 、田纳西河谷管理局等至今仍产生着影响。

1929至1933年间，经济大萧条，造成通货紧缩，使得偿还债务更为困难。

新政之前，银行内的存款没有保险，当数以千计的银行倒闭时，存户也损失了他们的存款。**当时没有国家安全网、没有"公共失业保险"、也没有社会安全法案。**救济穷人的责任在于家庭、私人慈善机构、与地方政府，但是年复一年却每况愈下，需求直升、救济的资源远远供不应求。

萧条的经济摧毁了这个国家。当罗斯福在1933年宣誓就职时，州政府已经关闭了所有的银行，没有人可以兑现支票或取得他们的存款。失业率大约是25%，而且在主要的工业或矿业中心更高。**1929年农业的收入下降超过50%。1930到1933年间，844,000件非农场房贷被扣押，**总计达五百万美元。**政治与商业领袖都害怕即将发生革命以及后续的无政府状态。**在大萧条期间仍旧很富裕的老约瑟夫·P·肯尼迪在数年之后说道：“在那些日子里，我曾说过我愿意分出一半的财产──如果我可以确定法律与秩序能让我保有剩下的一半的话。”

**罗斯福当选时并未有一套特别的计划来处理大萧条，所以他如同国会般听取各种意见。**在罗斯福的顾问中，最有名的是“国策智库（Brain Trust），这群人倾向于正面看待政府对经济务实性的干预。他所选用的劳工部长弗朗西丝·珀金斯大幅度地影响了他的想法，她对工作的各种应具备性质的名单如：“一周工时40小时、最低工资、工人的补偿、失业补偿、禁止童工的联邦法律、直接来自于联邦的失业救济、社会安全法案、再兴劳工委员会与健康保险”。
