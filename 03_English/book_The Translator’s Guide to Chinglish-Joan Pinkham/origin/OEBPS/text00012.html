<title>VII. The Noun Plague</title>
</head>
<body style="font-family:cnepub,serif;">
<h2>VII. The Noun Plague</h2>
<p>Plain English is a language based on verbs. It is simple, concise, vigorous and, above all, clear. Chinglish is a language based on nouns—vague, general, abstract nouns. It is complicated, long-winded, ponderous, and obscure.</p>
<p>As we saw in Chapter I, Chinglish contains many nouns that are unnecessary. We examined three types that contribute nothing to the meaning of a sentence and can simply be eliminated:</p>
<p>-redundant nouns (“to accelerate the <u>pace</u>
 of economic reform" = "to accelerate economic reform" ; "there have been good harvests in <u>agriculture</u>
 " = "there have been good harvests")</p>
<p>-empty nouns (“following the <u>realization</u>
 of mechanization" = "following the mechanization" ; "we must pay <u>attention</u>
 to promoting" = "we must promote")</p>
<p>-category nouns (“opposing the <u>practice</u>
 of extravagance" = "opposing extravagance" ; "to achieve the <u>objective</u>
 of clarity" = "to be clear")</p>
<p>At the same time, we looked at two groups of nouns that do carry necessary meaning but that drag unnecessary words along with them. To express their meaning more concisely, we changed them to verbs:</p>
<p>-nouns in the construction unnec. verb + noun (“to make an <u>improvement</u>
 in" = "to improve")</p>
<p>-"third word" nouns in the construction unnec. verb + unnec. noun + third word (“to reach the goal of <u>modernization</u>
 " = "to modernize")</p>
<p>There are also many constructions involving nouns like "improvement" and "modernization" that we did not discuss in Chapter I because they do not include unnecessary words. Yet those too should be edited out wherever possible, simply because the nouns are abstract.</p>
<p>In this chapter we shall consider abstract nouns as a class and see both why and how to avoid them.</p>
<h3 id="c1">Perils of using abstract nouns</h3>
<p>Authorities on English consistently condemn the use of abstract language. The consensus is perhaps best summed up by the American scholar Jacques Barzun, a master of the crafts of writing and translation. In his guide for writers, significantly entitled <i>Simple and Direct</i>
 , he makes this recommendation [pp. 16－17]:</p>
<p>Prefer the concrete word to the abstract. Follow that advice and you will see your prose gain in lucidity and force. Unnecessary abstraction is one of the worst faults of modern writing—the string of nouns held together by prepositions and relying on the passive voice to convey the enfeebled sense.</p>
<p>In the same way, Ernest Gowers [pp. 78－79], addressing British civil servants, singles out the preference for the abstract word as "the greatest vice of present-day writing."He warns in particular that "an excessive reliance on the noun at the expense of the verb will... insensibly induce a habit of abstraction, generalisation and vagueness."</p>
<p>The authors of books on writing often use metaphors comparing the use of abstract nouns to an infection. Fowler [p. 5] calls it the "disease" of "abstractitis."William Zinsser [pp. 116－117] speaks of "dead" sentences and the blight of "creeping nounism."And Wilson Follett, whose <i>Modern American Usage</i>
 is as much a classic as Fowler's <i>Dictionary of Modern English Usage,</i>
 urges writers [p. 230] to "avoid abstract nouns like the plague."</p>
<h3 id="c2">Sentences based on abstract nouns</h3>
<p>To see how abstract nouns undermine straightforward communication we have only to look at the following example, in which the same idea is expressed in two different ways:</p>
<p>A: The <u>prolongation</u>
 of the <u>existence</u>
 of this temple is due to the <u>solidity</u>
 of its <u>construction</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: This temple <i>has endured</i>
 because <i>it was solidly built.</i>
</p>
<p>The first version contains four abstract nouns, while the second has none. Not only do the nouns make the statement nearly twice as long, but they also make it pretentious, wooden, and hard to understand.</p>
<p>Chinglish abounds in sentences that rely chiefly on nouns to express their meaning. Here are three examples taken from draft translations:</p>
<p>-A curtailment of both city and town population as well as streamlining of administrative personnel for an enhancement of work efficiency constitutes an important aspect in our tasks of adjustment.</p>
<p>-With stability of currency and prices achieved, there had to be readjustment of industry and commerce as well as improved communications throughout the country, in accordance with the new conditions and demands, so that they could serve the restoration of production.</p>
<p>-The basic requirements of the struggle against Right-leaning conservatism are the further development and consolidation of the people's dictatorship in our country, the early accomplishment of socialist transformation, the overfulfillment of the state plan for industrial development, and the rapid progress of the technical transformation of the national economy.</p>
<p>The preference for abstract language is not, of course, unique to Chinglish. If the advice-givers make such a point of condemning it, that is precisely because it pervades so much of the writing of native speakers of English.</p>
<p>Abstract nouns are the common coin of academic institutions, government bureaucracies, the military establishment, large corporations, and so on (groups for which obscurity is often an advantage). Abstract nouns are also favored by many ordinary citizens, when they wish to sound authoritative or scientific.</p>
<p>Following are three more examples, this time from the English produced by native speakers, of what has been termed "the noun style."Like the Chinglish sentences cited above, they illustrate what Gowers [p. 79] calls "the habit of using abstract words to say in a complicated way something that might be said simply and directly."</p>
<p>Note that the proposed revisions are based on strong verbs in the active voice and on concrete nouns that one might use in everyday speech.</p>
<p>
<i>-From an article in a U. S. journal of higher education:</i>
</p>
<p>A: The <u>age distribution</u>
 of <u>higher education faculty</u>
 necessitates immediate <u>implementation</u>
 of innovative early retirement programs.</p>
<p>B: Because <i>there are so many older teachers in colleges and universities, we should</i>
 immediately <i>introduce</i>
 innovative programs for early retirement.</p>
<p>
<i>-From the instructions by a manufacturer of cookware, explaining what to do if the screw attaching the handle to a pot works loose:</i>
</p>
<p>A: In such a <u>case</u>
 , simple <u>application</u>
 of a screwdriver should be used to tighten screw. <u>Failure</u>
 to tighten the screw can eventually lead to <u>disengagement</u>
 of the handle.</p>
<p>B: <i>If this happens,</i>
 simply <i>tighten</i>
 the screw with a screwdriver; <i>otherwise,</i>
 the handle <i>may come off.</i>
</p>
<p>[Apparently, in the attempt to imitate scientific jargon, the writer of these instructions failed to notice that one cannot use "application" to tighten a screw.]</p>
<p>
<i>-From a clothing manufacturer's advertisement for a seminar entitled "Dressing for Objectives" :</i>
</p>
<p>A: It's a highly informative presentation on <u>image packaging</u>
 and <u>impression management</u>
 for business professionals.</p>
<p>B: It's a highly informative presentation that <i>shows how</i>
 business executives <i>can dress to create a favorable impression.</i>
</p>
<p>As can be seen from these examples, even a few abstract nouns in a short sentence make it difficult to grasp what the writer is trying to say. In a longer sentence, if nouns begin to multiply, they impede understanding even more.</p>
<p>And if nouns proliferate to the point where they spread first throughout the paragraph, then down the entire page, the reader, tired of having to go over every sentence twice in order to make sense of it, may simply abandon the struggle. When that happens, the nouns have indeed become a deadly plague, and it is the reader who has succumbed.</p>
<h3 id="c3">Combating the plague</h3>
<p>As we saw in Chapter I, if a noun is empty or redundant, it can simply be deleted. If, however, it carries a necessary element of meaning, the translator must find some other way of dealing with it.</p>
<p>The usual solution is to transform the noun into a different part of speech. We shall look at three ways of doing this and then at an alternative solution that may be useful if these do not work.</p>
<p>1. <i>
<u>Replacing the noun with a verb</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>This is the commonest device and the first to consider. It is the one we have used repeatedly, starting in Chapter I, to deal with the unnec. verb + noun constructions (“make an <u>improvement</u>
 " = "improve").</p>
<p>It can be used in many other situations as well. For example:</p>
<p>A: <u>Adherence</u>
 to Marxism is vital to China, and so is <u>adherence</u>
 to socialism.</p>
<p>B: It is vital for us to <i>adhere</i>
 to Marxism and socialism.</p>
<p>A: otherwise, there can be no <u>achievements</u>
 in our work</p>
<p>B: otherwise, we can <i>achieve</i>
 nothing</p>
<p>A: such <u>behavior</u>
 on the part of leading cadres will encourage extravagance</p>
<p>B: if leading cadres <i>behave</i>
 that way, they will encourage extravagance</p>
<p>A: <u>reading</u>
 of newly published materials is also important</p>
<p>B: it is also important to <i>read</i>
 newly published materials</p>
<p>2. <i>
<u>Replacing the noun with a gerund</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>As you will recall from your study of English grammar, a gerund is the “-ing" form of a verb that functions as a noun. In the example just above, "reading" is a gerund; "replacing" in the subtitles is another.</p>
<p>Gerunds, which are part verb, part noun, partake of the nature of both. Like nouns, they can be heavy and awkward—that is why we changed "reading" to "to read."But they also inherit some of the virtues of their parent verbs. Like verbs, gerunds can impart motion to a sentence that is stiff and lifeless. And because, like verbs, they usually require the writer to express a subject or a direct object—that is, to say plainly who is doing what—they can clarify meaning.</p>
<p>For these reasons, it is often useful to substitute gerunds for nouns, as in the following examples:</p>
<p>A: economic <u>revitalization</u>
 will be an arduous task</p>
<p>B: <i>revitalizing</i>
 the economy will be an arduous task</p>
<p>A: the company began its <u>issuance</u>
 of 100 million foreign currency B shares yesterday</p>
<p>B: the company began <i>issuing</i>
 100 million foreign currency B shares yesterday</p>
<p>A: we shall transform the national bourgeoisie through <u>cooperation</u>
 with it</p>
<p>B: we shall transform the national bourgeoisie by <i>cooperating</i>
 with it</p>
<p>A: we have to concentrate our efforts on agricultural <u>reinforcement</u>
</p>
<p>B: we have to concentrate on <i>strengthening</i>
 agriculture</p>
<p>[<u>Review</u>
 : "Efforts" was eliminated because it is understood in "concentrate."]</p>
<p>3. <i>
<u>Replacing the noun with an adjective or adverb</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>Sometimes good results can be achieved by substituting an adjective (or a verb + adjective) or, more rarely, an adverb:</p>
<p>A: this accounts for the <u>unsoundness</u>
 in organization of these enterprises</p>
<p>B: this accounts for the <i>poor</i>
 organization of these enterprises</p>
<p>A: silk undershirts are rich in <u>elasticity</u>
</p>
<p>B: silk undershirts are (highly) <i>elastic</i>
</p>
<p>A: facts will prove the <u>correctness</u>
 of these policies</p>
<p>B: facts will prove that these policies are <i>correct</i>
</p>
<p>A: we must guard against <u>blindness</u>
 in action</p>
<p>B: we must guard against acting <i>blindly</i>
</p>
<p>[Note that the second noun, "action," has been replaced by the gerund "acting."]</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>An alternative solution: "spelling it out</u>
 "</i>
</p>
<p>Sometimes the noun construction is so condensed, or so vague, that it takes more than a change of form to produce an understandable sentence in English. In that case, the translator may have to introduce a few new words to "spell out" the meaning:</p>
<p>A: The practice of indiscriminate <u>abolition</u>
 tallies with neither Mao Zedong Thought nor the scientific method.</p>
<p>B: <i>Abolishing all rules</i>
 indiscriminately is not consistent either with Mao Zedong Thought or with the scientific method.</p>
<p>[<u>Review</u>
 : "The practice of" is only a useless category noun.]</p>
<p>A: A Beijing computer newspaper even makes the point that China is entering a PC era that is going to be characterized by the <u>dominance</u>
 of national brands.</p>
<p>B: A Beijing computer newspaper even makes the point that China is entering a PC era in which national brands <i>will dominate the market.</i>
</p>
<p>A: Can anyone imagine that Hong Kong is free from <u>obstacles</u>
 or sabotaging <u>forces</u>
 ?</p>
<p>B: Can anyone imagine that there are no forces in Hong Kong <i>that might engage in</i>
 obstruction or sabotage?</p>
<p>A: it is important to give full scope to the <u>role</u>
 of experts</p>
<p>B: it is important to take full advantage of the <i>knowledge and abilities</i>
 of experts</p>
<p>Here, of course, as at any time when you add to the English version an element that is not explicit in the Chinese, you must be particularly careful that your interpretation of the original is correct.</p>
<h3 id="c4">A special form of the plague</h3>
<p>There is one particular form of the over-use of nouns that deserves special consideration. It is the tendency to employ them as adjectives modifying other nouns.</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Using a single noun as an adjective</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>First, it should be acknowledged that using a single noun as an adjective is entirely legitimate in English. Nothing could be more natural than to refer to "an <u>army</u>
 officer," "the <u>street</u>
 corner," "<u>drug</u>
 addiction," or "an <u>income</u>
 tax."The meaning of such neat phrases is clear at once. No one would suggest that it is necessary to revise them using prepositions: "an officer in the army," "the corner of the street," "addiction to drugs," or "a tax on income."</p>
<p>Longer nouns can be used in this way just as easily, when no equivalent adjectives are available. "<u>Government</u>
 department," "<u>application</u>
 form," "<u>university</u>
 education," "<u>television</u>
 set," and countless other such phrases are no more awkward and no more difficult to understand than the ones just cited.</p>
<p>This does not mean, however, that you should feel free to use any given noun to modify any other. Outside the circle of familiar combinations like the ones above, it is well to exercise caution. Most often the sentence will be clearer and flow more naturally if the noun is not made to serve as an adjective.</p>
<p>Take this sentence for example:</p>
<p>-The method of <u>work</u>
 evaluation and <u>workpoints</u>
 allotment should be changed.</p>
<p>Here the use of "work" to modify "evaluation" and of "workpoints" to modify "allotment" gives readers pause. These are not combinations that they are used to encountering. And their understanding is slowed by the unnatural word order, which in each pair conceals the true relation between adjective and noun.</p>
<p>In ordinary, straightforward discourse, the idea would be expressed like this:</p>
<p>-The method of evaluating work and allotting workpoints should be changed.</p>
<p>In this version, "work" and "workpoints" are plainly the direct objects of "evaluating" and "allotting," and the clarification speeds readers on their way.</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Using two nouns as adjectives</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>The use of two nouns to make a compound adjective is also acceptable when its sense is easy to grasp. There is no need, for instance, to spell out the meaning of "a <u>hospital maternity</u>
 ward" as "a ward set aside for the care of maternity cases in a hospital."There are a great many familiar combinations like this: "<u>water conservancy</u>
 project," "<u>malaria eradication</u>
 campaign," "<u>minority nationality</u>
 areas," "<u>Peking opera</u>
 company," and so on.</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Using three or more nouns as adjectives</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>In special circumstances, even compounds made of three nouns can be understood. Probably no reader would stumble over "a <u>State Planning Commission</u>
 document."The capital letters tie the elements of the compound together as the title of an organization, preventing confusion.</p>
<p>Instances of this sort, however, are exceptional. The general rule is that no more than two nouns should be combined into an adjective modifying another noun.</p>
<p>The phrases "<u>lung</u>
 cancer," "<u>cancer</u>
 research," "<u>research</u>
 project" and "<u>project</u>
 design" are all perfectly intelligible and commonly used. In an article in which such terms came up frequently, we might even be able to speak of "<u>lung cancer</u>
 research" without slowing the reader down. But that does not give us license to write "the <u>lung cancer research project</u>
 design," in the pleasant belief that we have come up with a more concise substitute for "the design of the research project on lung cancer."</p>
<p>Compound modifiers as long as this one are not uncommon in Chinglish. Typically, they consist of several nouns (or nouns plus adjectives) strung together without prepositions or other connecting words. Diligent readers who take the trouble to study a sequence like "the lung cancer research project design" may eventually perceive what the writer has in mind. But what are they to make of a sequence like "State key protection relic sites" ? Can anyone tell which word modifies which, or what these sites might be?</p>
<p>The following strings of nouns have all appeared in Chinese publications for foreigners:</p>
<p>-power supply business regions</p>
<p>-China's conformity assessment system</p>
<p>-1998 China Daily Newspaper Group Subscription Consultancy Day</p>
<p>-China's first National Urban Construction Archive Sector Achievements Expo</p>
<p>In the last example, the series includes not only nouns but also some true adjectives ("first," "National," "Urban"). But even when that is the case, phrases like these are so highly compressed that one can only guess at their meaning.</p>
<p>The reason that strings of nouns appear so often in draft translations is, of course, that they are literal renderings of the original. Chinese characters are commonly juxtaposed without written links, and Chinese readers readily understand the invisible connections between them. But carried over into English, the pattern is both awkward and ambiguous, when it is not simply incomprehensible.</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Avoiding the use of nouns as adjectives</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>When a noun-as-adjective construction is difficult to understand, the translator should revise the sentence to clarify the relations between the words. Following are three principal ways to do this—plus a fourth, if all else fails.</p>
<p>1. The construction can be treated like any other manifestation of the noun plague. That is, when there are two or three nouns together, <u>one of them can be converted into another part of speech</u>
 . Here are some examples, starting with the one cited above:</p>
<p>A: The method of <u>work evaluation</u>
 and <u>workpoints allotment</u>
 should be changed.</p>
<p>B: The method of <i>evaluating</i>
 work and <i>allotting</i>
 workpoints should be changed.</p>
<p>[In this instance, the second noun of each pair—the one being modified—was changed to a gerund. "Work" and "workpoints" then automatically found their normal places as direct objects.]</p>
<p>A: measures adopted by local governments in <u>soil erosion control</u>
 include the following</p>
<p>B: measures adopted by local governments to <i>control</i>
 soil erosion include the following</p>
<p>[Here again, the noun being modified was changed, this time to a verb. As a result, "soil erosion" followed naturally as the direct object of "control."]</p>
<p>A: the Party's expanded <u>leadership capacity</u>
 in struggles</p>
<p>B: the Party's expanded capacity to <i>lead</i>
 struggles</p>
<p>[In this instance, it was the noun being used as an adjective that was changed to a verb. This put the three ideas "leadership," "capacity" and "struggles" in their normal English order, making the relations between them instantly understandable.]</p>
<p>A: "Most of the <u>technology transformation</u>
 should be placed under the control of the market," Lu said.</p>
<p>B: "Most of the <i>technological</i>
 transformation should be placed under the control of the market," Lu said.</p>
<p>[Here again, it was the noun being used as an adjective that was changed, this time to the corresponding true adjective.]</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, changing a noun to another part of speech will also serve to break up a longer sequence of nouns (or of nouns plus adjectives):</p>
<p>A: China's <u>meteorological system modernization drive</u>
</p>
<p>B: China's drive to <i>modernize</i>
 its meteorological system</p>
<p>A: the reform of the <u>science and technology management system</u>
</p>
<p>B: the reform of the system for <i>managing</i>
 science and technology</p>
<p>A: the <u>State assets management institutions</u>
</p>
<p>B: the institutions responsible for <i>managing</i>
 State assets</p>
<p>In the first example, one of the nouns was changed to a verb. In the second and third, a noun was changed to a gerund. In each case the other nouns in the phrase became direct objects. Thus, an undifferentiated series of words was sorted into grammatically related parts.</p>
<p>2. In some constructions made of two or three nouns it is possible to retain all of them as nouns, providing <u>a preposition is introduced</u>
 to show the connection between them:</p>
<p>A: during the economic <u>recovery period</u>
 in the early 1950s</p>
<p>B: during the period <i>of</i>
 economic recovery in the early 1950s</p>
<p>A: scientific and technological experts now take part in economic and social <u>policy decisions</u>
</p>
<p>B: scientists and technicians now take part in decisions <i>on</i>
 economic and social policy</p>
<p>A: <u>research topic selection</u>
 should also be guided by the market</p>
<p>B: the selection <i>of</i>
 research topics should also be guided by the market</p>
<p>This method too can sometimes be used to break up a string of nouns. Even a very long sequence will become intelligible when appropriate prepositions are inserted:</p>
<p>A: Golmud is an important <u>personnel and materials transfer center</u>
</p>
<p>B: Golmud is an important center <i>for</i>
 the transfer <i>of</i>
 personnel and materials</p>
<p>A: Wan Wenpeng, leader of the provincial <u>drug abuse control consultancy expert group</u>
</p>
<p>B: Wan Wenpeng, leader of the province's group <i>of</i>
 expert consultants <i>on</i>
 the control <i>of</i>
 drug abuse</p>
<p>[Note that the abstract "consultancy" was changed to concrete "consultants."]</p>
<p>A: the <u>China Foreign Experts Employment Contract Disputes Arbitration Commission</u>
</p>
<p>B: China's Commission <i>for</i>
 Arbitration <i>of</i>
 Contract Disputes <i>with</i>
 Foreign Experts</p>
<p>[<u>Review</u>
 : "Employment" can be omitted as a self-evident modifier.]</p>
<p>3. Sometimes the same clarifying effect can be achieved by <u>using a hyphen</u>
 . Take a phrase like "two noun combinations that form compound adjectives."This expression leaves the reader in doubt about its meaning.</p>
<p>A revision that supplies the preposition "of" dispels the doubt at once. "Combinations of two nouns that form compound adjectives" makes it clear that we are not talking about "two combinations of nouns."</p>
<p>But a revision that supplies a hyphen will serve as well. If we write "two-noun combinations that form compound adjectives," the "two" plainly modifies "noun," and both together modify "combinations."</p>
<p>In the same way, to make sure the reader does not have even a brief moment of misunderstanding, "mobile phone users" could be changed either to "users of mobile phones" or to "mobile-phone users.”"An increase in grain and cotton production" could become either "an increase in production of grain and cotton" or "an increase in grain-and cotton-production."</p>
<p>There are many such hyphenated adjectives so common that the reader slides over them as easily as if they were single words: "twentieth-century writers," "Right-wing attacks," "a fur-bearing animal," "a low-salt diet," etc. Apart from such familiar compounds, however, the structure using the preposition is generally preferable, being simpler and more readily understood.</p>
<p>If you do decide to employ a hyphen, you should give some thought to its placement and to the placement of the compound created. The everyday English written by native speakers of the language shows often enough that carelessness in these matters can create confusion.</p>
<p>For example, the American nursery school that advertised for a “3-year-old teacher," adding "experience preferred," would have been better advised to seek a "teacher of 3-year-olds."If the cancer clinic in the U. S. that urged women to "perform monthly self-breast exams" had advised them instead to "examine their breasts every month," it would not have raised the question of what a "self-breast" might be. (It would also have avoided a Chinglish construction that only contributes to the gross national product of nouns: to perform exams = to examine. )</p>
<p>4. Sometimes the translator has tried to cram so much information into a noun-as-adjective phrase that it is not enough to change the noun into another part of speech or to insert a preposition or hyphen. Here again, as for other forms of the noun plague, when the usual methods are insufficient, the alternative solution is <u>adding a few words to spell out the meaning</u>
 .</p>
<p>A: In addition, we should encourage workers to make technological innovation, and put forward <u>rationalization suggestions</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: In addition, we should encourage workers to make technological innovations and to <i>suggest ways of rationalizing production.</i>
</p>
<p>A: The establishment of a <u>local specialties company</u>
 will enable us to use our foreign exchange effectively.</p>
<p>B: If we establish a <i>company for the export of local specialties</i>
 , we shall be able to use our foreign exchange effectively.</p>
<p>A: <u>Shareholding restructuring</u>
 of State enterprises was encouraged during the landmark 15th Party Congress held last month.</p>
<p>B: During the landmark 15th Party Congress held last month, State enterprises were encouraged to <i>restructure by introducing a system of shareholding</i>
 .</p>
<h3 id="c5">Twenty more examples of revision</h3>
<p>The same basic format that was used for the twenty examples of revision in each chapter of Part One is used here and in corresponding sections throughout Part Two.</p>
<p>1) A: <u>Analysis</u>
 is also necessary even for the imperialist camp.</p>
<p>B: It is also necessary to <i>analyze</i>
 even the imperialist camp.</p>
<p>[-A classic example of the ambiguity of abstract nouns. "Analysis" is a vague, floating notion, without either subject or object (whose analysis? of what?). The reader of A-version might just as well understand it to mean that even the imperialist camp has to analyze the opposing forces.</p>
<p>-The noun ("analysis") was changed to a verb ("analyze"). This anchored "analysis" to a direct object ("the imperialist camp") and thus made the meaning unmistakable.]</p>
<p>2) A: On the contrary, <u>refusal</u>
 to make an effort to examine the mistake and draw lessons from it is bound to lead to <u>loss</u>
 of face.</p>
<p>B: If, on the contrary, he [the Party member] <i>refuses</i>
 to examine the mistake and to learn from it, he is bound to <i>lose</i>
 face.</p>
<p>[-"Refusal" was changed to a verb with a subject ("he").</p>
<p>-The introduction of a subject then made it possible to replace "lead to loss" with a simple verb ("lose").</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : "Make an effort to" was eliminated as a pointless introductory phrase. "Draw lessons" = unnec. verb + noun, replaced by plain verb "learn.")]</p>
<p>3) A: A man's <u>ascent</u>
 to the position of a high official meant the <u>advent</u>
 of a comfortable and wealthy life for his whole family and his <u>attainment</u>
 to the top of the social ladder signified the <u>rise</u>
 of all his relatives as well.</p>
<p>B: When a man <i>ascended (or:</i>
 climbed) to high position, his whole family <i>was assured</i>
 of an affluent life, and when he <i>reached</i>
 the top of the ladder, all his relatives <i>rose</i>
 as well.</p>
<p>[-"Ascent" was changed to a verb ("ascended").</p>
<p>-"Advent" became a verb + adjective ("was assured of").</p>
<p>-"Attainment" and "rise" were also changed to verbs ("reached" and "rose").</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : "Comfortable and wealthy" = redundant twins, replaced by a single word better than either: "affluent.")]</p>
<p>4) A: <u>Keeping</u>

 for the smooth advance in the reform and economic development.</p>
<p>B: If we want to <i>guarantee</i>
 the smooth advance of the reform and economic development, it is essential to <i>keep</i>
 our employees honest and industrious and to <i>combat</i>
 corruption of all kinds.</p>
<p>[-Both gerunds ("keeping" and "combating") and the noun ("guarantee") were changed to verbs.</p>
<p>-(The word order was changed to put the important point—what we must do—at the end of the sentence. )]</p>
<p>5) A: A <u>readjustment</u>
 of the production targets will facilitate the <u>planning</u>
 of a more realistic program.</p>
<p>B: <i>Readjusting</i>
 the production targets will make it easier to <i>plan</i>
 a more realistic program.</p>
<p>[-The noun "readjustment" was changed to a gerund, "Readjusting."</p>
<p>-The gerund "planning" was upgraded to a verb, "to plan."]</p>
<p>6) A: Paishanlou gold mine, which formally started operation in June, is a gold mine with the largest <u>production scale</u>

 of <u>modernization</u>
 in China.</p>
<p>B: Paishanlou gold mine, which formally started operation in June, is the <i>largest</i>
 and <i>most modern</i>
 in China.</p>
<p>[-First the reviser changed the noun-as-adjective construction in the usual way, using a preposition and returning "production" to its original function as a noun ("the largest scale of production").</p>
<p>-It then became clear that both "scale" and "production" were redundant: a mine "with the largest scale of production" is simply the "largest" mine. Similarly, the mine "with the highest degree of modernization" is the "most modern."Thus, the revision reduced four abstract nouns to two everyday adjectives.</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : The second reference to a "gold mine" was simply omitted as an unnec. repetition. )]</p>
<p>7) A: Government departments, schools, factories, and enterprises should fix the number of their employees and set work loads for all of them in accordance with the units' needs. Furthermore, every possible <u>reduction</u>
 and <u>postponement</u>
 should be made.</p>
<p>B: Government departments, schools, factories, and enterprises should fix the number of their employees and set work loads for all of them in accordance with the units' needs. Furthermore, whenever it is possible to <i>reduce</i>
 or <i>postpone an expenditure</i>
 , they should do so.</p>
<p>[-Confronted with A-version, the reader wonders "reduction and postponement of <u>what</u>
 ?" This sentence, coming immediately after the one about the number of employees, seems to call for reductions in staff and postponement of any new appointments.</p>
<p>-When the reviser studied the passage as a whole, however, she concluded that the intended sense was reduction and postponement of expenditure.</p>
<p>-By changing the abstract nouns to verbs ("reduce," "postpone"), she made it both possible and necessary to specify a direct object ("an expenditure") that made the meaning clear.]</p>
<p>8) A: Only when the masses feel that the Party and socialism are good in deed can our ideological and disciplinary <u>education</u>
 or <u>education</u>
 of socialism and patriotism be effective.</p>
<p>B: Only when the masses see concrete evidence that the Party and socialism are good can we <i>teach</i>
 them to cherish ideals and observe discipline and <i>imbue</i>
 them with socialism and patriotism.</p>
<p>[-Here the noun structure was so compressed that the sense was hard to grasp. The polishers therefore used verbs ("teach," "cherish," "observe" and "imbue") to spell out their understanding of the meaning.</p>
<p>-(The phrase "are good in deed" was changed because the natural expression in English is not "to be good in deed" but "to do good deeds."The sense was apparently that the masses would see "good deeds" as a demonstration of the worth of the Party and socialism. This led to the more idiomatic version "see concrete evidence.")]</p>
<p>9) A: a state firm in Shaoguan, Guangdong Province, was auctioned off to the public last Sunday as a result of its <u>loss-making operation</u>
 , the China News Service reported</p>
<p>B: a state firm in Shaoguan, Guangdong Province, was auctioned off to the public last Sunday because it <i>was operating at a loss (or:</i>
 losing money), the China News Service reported</p>
<p>[-By replacing "as a result of" with "because," the polisher was able to turn the second noun ("operation") into a verb ("was operating").</p>
<p>-Thus the awkward and unusual compound adjective "loss-making" could be transformed into an idiomatic expression familiar to the reader: "operating at a loss."]</p>
<p>10) A: A <u>gift registration system</u>
 and an <u>income declaration system</u>
 for government officials have already been established in some regions of China.</p>
<p>B: Systems under which government officials must <i>register</i>
 gifts and <i>declare</i>
 their income have already been established in some regions.</p>
<p>[-In the first noun-as-adjective phrase, the second noun ("registration") was again converted to a verb ("must register"), with the first noun ("gift") as its direct object.</p>
<p>-The second phrase was revised in the same way ("must declare their income").</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : The use of a plural eliminated the need to repeat "system.""Of China" was dropped as a self-evident modifier. )]</p>
<p>11) A: To participate in social labor is an important <u>prerequisite</u>
 for the <u>emancipation</u>
 of women.</p>
<p>B: If women <i>are to be emancipated,</i>
 it <i>is essential</i>
 for them to participate in social labor.</p>
<p>[-"Prerequisite" was recast as a verb + adjective ("it is essential").</p>
<p>-"Emancipation" was changed to a verb.</p>
<p>-(The revision is not only simpler and more direct, but has the further advantage of placing the important point—women must participate—in the place of emphasis, at the end of the sentence. Cf. example 4. )]</p>
<p>12) A: This resulted from our <u>lack</u>
 of <u>vigilance</u>
 against attack and also from <u>lack</u>
 of cadres and battle-seasoned troops.</p>
<p>B: This was partly because we <i>were not sufficiently vigilant (or:</i>
 on guard) against attack, and partly because we <i>did not have enough cadres and battle-seasoned troops.</i>
</p>
<p>[-Replacing "this resulted from" with "because" made it possible to turn the first "lack" into a verb + adjective ("were not vigilant").</p>
<p>-By the same token, the second "lack" became a simple verb ("did not have").]</p>
<p>13) A: There was a <u>lack</u>
 of a sense of urgency in solving these problems [serious accidents caused by criminal negligence] and the <u>fear</u>
 of some <u>procuratorate officials</u>
 of offending important people by probing into such cases.</p>
<p>B: There was <i>no</i>
 sense of urgency about solving these problems, and some officials <i>of</i>
 the procuratorates <i>were afraid</i>
 of offending important people by probing such cases.</p>
<p>[-It would have been preferable to convert this "lack"—like the second "lack" in the example above—into a verb with a subject.</p>
<p>-But since it was impossible to tell from the context just who it was that "lacked a sense of urgency" (procuratorates in general? certain officials? local governments?), the polishers had to leave the subject vague.</p>
<p>-Still, they were able to dispose of the noun "lack" by substituting the adjective "no."</p>
<p>-"Fear," for which a subject was provided (the "officials"), could be changed to a verb + adjective ("were afraid").</p>
<p>-The noun-as-adjective construction ("procuratorate officials") was simplified by restoring "procuratorate" to its function as a noun and introducing the preposition "of."]</p>
<p>14) A: This unhealthy tendency has emerged partly due to cadres' <u>shortage</u>
 of the <u>spirit</u>
 to serve the people and partly due to their <u>lack</u>
 of <u>understanding</u>
 of the current situation in the Northeast.</p>
<p>B: This unhealthy tendency has emerged partly because cadres <i>are not sufficiently dedicated</i>
 to serving the people and partly because they <i>do not understand</i>
 the current situation in the Northeast.</p>
<p>[-"Due to" is another phrase that ends in a preposition and therefore leads inevitably to a noun, a pronoun or, at best, a gerund. Cf. "as a result of" in example 9 and "resulted from" in example 12.</p>
<p>-As in both of those examples, the solution here was to substitute "because," which leads to a verb.</p>
<p>-This made it possible to replace both nouns in "shortage of the spirit to serve" with the more idiomatic verb + adjective construction "are not sufficiently dedicated to serving."</p>
<p>-It also made it possible to change the two nouns in "lack of understanding" to a simple verb, "do not understand."]</p>
<p>15) A: This would not only be a <u>hindrance</u>
 to the people of different nationalities in <u>exchanging</u>
 experience with and <u>learning</u>
 from each other but also a great <u>disadvantage</u>
 to the development of culture.</p>
<p>B: This would not only <i>make it difficult</i>
 for people of different nationalities to <i>exchange</i>
 experience and <i>learn</i>
 from each other, but would also <i>impede</i>
 the development of culture.</p>
<p>[-"Be a hindrance" (an unnec. verb + noun) was changed to "make it difficult" (a verb + adjective).</p>
<p>-This made it possible to convert the gerunds "exchanging" and "learning" to verbs ("exchange," "learn").</p>
<p>-"Be a disadvantage" was then turned into a verb as well: "would impede."]</p>
<p>16) A: there is the <u>likelihood</u>
 that you will easily commit errors of national <u>discrimination</u>
</p>
<p>B: you <i>are likely</i>
 to make the mistake of <i>discriminating against the minority nationalities</i>
</p>
<p>[-The noun "likelihood" was changed to a verb + adjective ("you are likely").</p>
<p>-The ambiguous phrase "national discrimination" was spelled out with a gerund ("discriminating against"). (Note that "national discrimination"—if it means anything—would be "discrimination on a national scale" or "nationwide discrimination," which is not the intent here. )]</p>
<p>17) A: it is also imperative for <u>success</u>
 to improve the <u>leadership structure</u>
 of the enterprises and give fuller <u>scope</u>
 to the <u>role</u>
 of the Party organization as the political core</p>
<p>B: to <i>be successful,</i>
 an enterprise must improve the structure <i>of</i>
 its leadership and <i>ensure</i>
 that the Party organization <i>functions</i>
 as the political core</p>
<p>[-The noun "success" was changed to a verb + adjective ("to be successful").</p>
<p>-The noun-as-adjective phrase "leadership structure" was broken up with the preposition "of" ("the structure of its leadership").</p>
<p>-"Scope" and "role"—two of the vaguest abstract nouns in Chinglish—were both dispensed with, in favor of a simple structure using two precise verbs ("ensure" and "functions").]</p>
<p>And now let us see what the revisers did to lighten up the three examples of the noun plague in Chinglish that were cited in the beginning.</p>
<p>18) A: A <u>curtailment</u>
 of both <u>city and town population</u>
 as well as <u>streamlining</u>
 of administrative personnel for an <u>enhancement</u>
 of <u>work efficiency</u>
 constitutes an important aspect in our <u>tasks</u>
 of <u>adjustment</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: An important aspect of <i>adjusting</i>
 the economy is to <i>reduce</i>
 the population <i>of</i>
 cities and towns and to <i>streamline</i>
 administrative personnel so as to <i>increase</i>
 efficiency.</p>
<p>[-"Adjustment" was replaced with the gerund "adjusting."This made it possible to introduce a direct object ("the economy"), which clarified the meaning.</p>
<p>-"Curtailment," "streamlining," and "enhancement" were all changed to simple verbs, ("reduce," "streamline," and "increase").</p>
<p>-The noun-as-adjective construction "city and town population" was simplified with the preposition "of."</p>
<p>-(As in examples 4 and 11, the order of ideas was changed to place the main point—the need for "curtailment" and "streamlining"—at the end of the sentence rather than the beginning. )</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : "Work" and "tasks" add nothing to the sense and were therefore deleted. )]</p>
<p>19) A: With <u>stability</u>
 of currency and prices achieved, there had to be <u>readjustment</u>
 of industry and commerce as well as improved communications throughout the country, in accordance with the new conditions and demands, so that they could serve the <u>restoration</u>
 of production.</p>
<p>B: Once the currency and prices <i>were stabilized,</i>
 to <i>help restore</i>
 production we had to <i>readjust</i>
 industry and commerce and improve communications throughout the country, in accordance with the new conditions and new demands.</p>
<p>[-"Stability" was replaced by a verb. (<u>Review</u>
 : "To achieve stability" = "to stabilize").</p>
<p>-"Readjustment" was changed to a verb in the active voice, which meant introducing the subject "we."It followed that "improved" would also become a verb, with the same subject.</p>
<p>-"Serve" was replaced with "help."This made it possible to change "restoration" to a verb ("restore"), with "production" as its direct object.</p>
<p>-(Again the order of ideas was changed. "To help restore production" was moved up toward the beginning of the sentence. This left the more important position to the more important idea, "we had to readjust... and improve... .")]</p>
<p>20) A: The basic requirements of the struggle against Right-leaning conservatism are the further <u>development</u>
 and <u>consolidation</u>
 of the people's dictatorship in our country, the early <u>accomplishment</u>
 of socialist transformation, the <u>overfulfillment</u>
 of the state plan for industrial development, and the rapid <u>progress</u>
 of the technical transformation of the national economy.</p>
<p>B: The basic requirements of the struggle against Right-leaning conservatism are that we must <i>consolidate</i>
 the people's dictatorship, <i>complete</i>
 the socialist transformation as quickly as possible, <i>overfulfill</i>
 the state plan for industrial development, and <i>speed up</i>
 the technical transformation of the economy.</p>
<p>[-"That we must" was brought in. This simple addition made it possible to change most of the nouns that followed to active verbs with a subject and direct objects ("consolidate," "complete," "overfulfill," and "speed up").</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : The first "development" was deleted because the polishers thought that its sense was included in "consolidation"—that is, that in this context the two were redundant twins. "In our country" was eliminated as a self-evident modifier. "National" was dropped because it too could be taken for granted. )]</p>
