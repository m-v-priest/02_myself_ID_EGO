<h2>XIII. Summing it All Up</h2>
<p>Like Chapter VI, which was a review of Part One on unnecessary words, this final chapter will be a review of Part Two on questions of sentence structure. It will offer no new material but only additional revisions and exercises representing the problems we have studied in this second part of the Guide.</p>
<h3 id="c1">Twenty more examples of revision</h3>
<p>As in Chapter VI, the explanation of the revisions will show the order in which the various faults in each example were dealt with. Usually the polisher started with the ones that were most obvious and easiest to correct—unnecessary words.</p>
<p>In your own work, you may prefer to reverse the order, starting with the major problems and then cleaning up the minor ones. In the course of practice you will settle on the procedure that suits you best. But a narrative account of the polisher's approach to each of the following passages will demonstrate one method of reaching an acceptable revision and, it is hoped, help demystify the editing process.</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>The Noun Plague</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>1) A: This decision is a <u>measure</u>
 of vital <u>importance</u>
 to do a good <u>job</u>
 of our financial and economic <u>management</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: This is a very <i>important</i>
 decision that will enable us to <i>manage</i>
 our financial and economic affairs <i>more effectively.</i>
</p>
<p>[-A-version of this short sentence was weighed down with five abstract nouns, of which only the first, "decision," appeared to be essential.</p>
<p>-The polisher first deleted "measure" as an empty word that added nothing to "decision."</p>
<p>-She then changed "importance" to an adjective ("an important decision").</p>
<p>-Next she changed "management" to a gerund: "to do a good job of managing our financial and economic affairs."</p>
<p>-This left the vague and endlessly repeated noun-formula "do a good job." It could not be simply eliminated, because it contained an element of meaning, but it could be easily replaced. The polisher had only to change "managing" to "to manage" and add "more effectively."]</p>
<p>2) A: Rational <u>scale</u>
 of investment is an important condition for maintaining economic stability and enhancing the sustaining <u>power</u>
 of development. The <u>scale</u>
 of construction projects now under way is large enough and the <u>scale</u>
 of planned investment for this year is not small either, so no further expansion can be permitted.</p>
<p>B: An important condition for maintaining economic stability and <i>continued</i>
 development is that <i>investment must be restricted to a rational scale. Enough</i>
 construction projects are already under way, and <i>considerable</i>
 investment is planned for this year, so no further expansion can be permitted.</p>
<p>[-The first problem the polisher noticed in A-version was the repetition of the abstract noun "scale" : three appearances in two sentences—at least two too many. She examined them in turn.</p>
<p>-The first "scale," she thought, was useful and should be retained. But "rational scale of investment" was too condensed for easy comprehension. Accordingly, she introduced a verb to spell out the idea: "investment must be restricted to a rational scale."</p>
<p>-This change also had the effect of correcting the word order: the important idea was now at the end of the sentence, where it led naturally into the next one.</p>
<p>-The two "scale" s in the second sentence, however, contributed nothing to meaning. The polisher found it was not hard to eliminate them both, using more concrete language and simpler constructions: "enough projects are already under way" and "considerable investment is planned."</p>
<p>-There remained the awkward circumlocution "enhancing the sustaining power of development."This, she decided, meant no more than "maintaining continued development," which eliminated another abstract noun, "power."]</p>
<p>3) A: China has continuously broadened its <u>scope</u>
 of <u>undertakings</u>
 in the field of multilateral diplomacy....</p>
<p>B: China has <i>taken an active part in more</i>
 <i>and more</i>
 multilateral diplomatic <i>forums</i>
 ....</p>
<p>[-First, recognizing"the field of" as an unnec. "category" noun, the polisher eliminated the phrase. That left "China has continuously broadened its scope of undertakings in multilateral diplomacy... ."</p>
<p>-The polisher considered that this language was too vague, abstract, and general to convey anything specific to the reader. Studying the original in context, he decided that to "broaden the scope" of diplomatic "undertakings" meant, in plain terms, to undertake more diplomacy—that is, to participate in more international forums.</p>
<p>-Accordingly, he dispensed with both "scope" and "undertakings," spelling the meaning out with the help of the relatively concrete "forums" and the simple "more and more."</p>
<p>-(It might even have sufficed to say: "China has taken an increasingly active part in multilateral diplomacy.")]</p>
<p>4) A: The <u>tendency</u>
 toward <u>indifference</u>
 [to intellectuals] is characterized by the <u>underestimation</u>
 of the <u>significance</u>
 of the tremendous progress made in the political and academic <u>studies</u>
 by the intellectuals and of the important role played by the intellectuals in our socialist cause....</p>
<p>B: <i>Certain comrades</i>
 are <i>indifferent</i>
 to intellectuals, because they <i>underestimate</i>
 the tremendous political and academic progress that intellectuals have made and the important role they have played in our socialist cause....</p>
<p>[-In approaching A-version, the polisher's first act was to replace the abstract "tendency" with some real people: "Certain comrades."This naturally led to a verb + adjective ("are indifferent") instead of the noun "indifference."</p>
<p>-She next considered what could be done with the abominable "characterized by."(That expression, like "conducive to," "aimed at," "resulting in," and countless others ending in prepositions, inevitably leads to a cottony mouthful of abstract nouns or gerunds. )</p>
<p>-She soon realized that in this case the words were not even logical: the cadres' indifference was not "characterized by" the underestimation etc. ; rather it was the result of it. This perception led to the revision, "because they underestimate."</p>
<p>-"Significance" seemed to add nothing useful, especially in the presence of "tremendous" and "important."The polisher simply deleted it. She likewise dispensed with "studies."</p>
<p>-To avoid a third reference to "intellectuals" in the same sentence, she substituted the pronoun "they" for the last one ("the important role they have played").</p>
<p>-Although earlier "they" had been used to represent "Certain comrades," she thought there would be no confusion in this instance.</p>
<p>-"Intellectuals" would be automatically understood as the antecedent, because it was nearer than "comrades," and especially because it was grammatically parallel to the pronoun: "the progress intellectuals have made" /"the role they have played."</p>
<p>-(It is not certain that one can "play a role" in a "cause."It might have been better to put, "the important contributions they have made to our socialist cause.")]</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Pronouns and Antecedents</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>5) A: Some countries have suffered serious setbacks, and socialism has seemingly been weakened. But the people will have tempered themselves and drawn lessons from <u>it</u>
 , and that will make socialism develop in a healthier direction.</p>
<p>B: Some countries have suffered major setbacks, and socialism appears to have been weakened. But the people have been tempered by <i>the setbacks</i>
 and have drawn lessons from <i>them,</i>
 and that will make socialism develop in a healthier direction.</p>
<p>[-The first thing that struck the polisher about A-version was that the translator had clearly paid no attention to the sound of what he or she had written.</p>
<p>-To the ear of a native speaker of English, the sequence "Some-suffered- serious-setbacks-socialism-seemingly" called attention to itself as an intolerable repetition. Indeed, it suggested a deliberate "tongue-twister," on the order of "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers."</p>
<p>-Accordingly, her first act was to break up the pattern by substituting "major" for "serious" and "appears" for "seemingly."</p>
<p>-Next, her attention was drawn to the vague "it," which had no antecedent. Presumably what the people had "drawn lessons from" was the "setbacks."But (1) to agree with the plural "setbacks," "it" would have to become "them," and (2) even if that change were made, "setbacks" would still be too far away to be immediately recognized as the antecedent.</p>
<p>-The solution was simply to repeat "setbacks" : "But the people have tempered themselves and drawn lessons from the setbacks."</p>
<p>-Then it occurred to the polisher that it was those same "setbacks" that had "tempered" the people. Perhaps a tighter logical connection could be made between the two elements: "But the people have been tempered by the setbacks and have drawn lessons from the setbacks."That was clearly the intended sense.</p>
<p>-All that remained was to avoid the third appearance of "setbacks."It could easily be replaced by the pronoun "them," which now had a clear and nearby antecedent that agreed in number: "But the people have been tempered by the setbacks and have drawn lessons from them."]</p>
<p>6) A: The Russians built the Chinese Eastern Railway in China's Northeast after the Qing Dynasty government concluded a secret pact with czarist Russia in 1896. <i>It</i>
 was operated by Russia until a 1924 Sino-Soviet agreement brought <i>it</i>
 under joint management. After the Kuomintang reactionary regime was established in 1927, <u>it</u>
 pursued a pro-imperialist and anti-Soviet foreign policy and created a series of anti-Soviet incidents.</p>
<p>B: The Russians built the Chinese Eastern Railway in Northeast China after the Qing Dynasty government concluded a secret pact with czarist Russia in 1896. <i>It</i>
 was operated by Russia until 1924, when a Sino-Soviet agreement brought <i>it</i>
 under joint management. <i>The reactionary KMT regime</i>
 established in 1927 pursued a pro-imperialist and anti-Soviet foreign policy and created a series of anti-Soviet incidents.</p>
<p>[-The first time the polisher read A-version she understood that the Eastern Railway pursued a pro-imperialist foreign policy.</p>
<p>-On a second reading she saw why she had been led astray: in the three successive uses of "it," the translator had switched antecedents without warning. The first two times the pronoun represented the railroad, but the third time it stood for the KMT regime.</p>
<p>-The change of antecedents was particularly misleading because the third pronoun ("it pursued"), like the first ("It was operated"), was the subject of its sentence. Since the two words had the same function as well as the same form, the reader tended to assume that they also had the same meaning.</p>
<p>-To prevent misreading, the polisher simply dropped the third "it" and substituted the words the pronoun was meant to represent: "the reactionary KMT regime."]</p>
<p>7) A: The news that Wang Baosen, Vice-Mayor of Beijing, had shot himself to death when faced with charges of "economic crimes" created quite a stir among Beijing residents, not only because he was the highest government official who had committed suicide since the Cultural Revolution and that he was using a gun, <u>which</u>
 is strictly forbidden in China, but also because of the potential political ramifications of his act.</p>
<p>B: The news that Wang Baosen, Vice-Mayor of Beijing, had shot himself when faced with charges of "economic crimes" created quite a stir among Beijing residents. They were shocked not only because Wang was the highest government official who had committed [<i>or:</i>
 to commit] suicide since the Cultural Revolution and because he had used a gun, <i>private possession of which</i>
 is strictly forbidden in China, but also because of the potential political ramifications of his act.</p>
<p>[-Reading A-version, the polisher first understood that in China people are forbidden to use guns to commit suicide. The relative pronoun "which" was correctly attached, referring to the immediately preceding clause ("that he was using a gun"). The problem was that that clause did not express the intended meaning.</p>
<p>-In the revision the polisher spelled out the true antecedent of "which."What is "strictly forbidden" in China is private possession of firearms.</p>
<p>-Rereading her revision, the polisher thought that the sentence was too long, presenting too much information for the reader to swallow at one gulp. Accordingly, she broke it into two, beginning the second sentence with "They were shocked," which under the circumstances seemed a justifiable addition.]</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>The Placement of Phrases and Clauses</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>8) A: [There is no doubt that the system of management described above is much more centralized than the one that was in effect last year. But if we were asked how many undertakings will still be under decentralized management, we would have to answer, a great many.] For example, agricultural production must be organized and led by local governments, <u>after the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has laid down the general principles</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: For example, <i>after the Ministry of Agriculture has laid down the general principles,</i>
 agricultural production still has to be organized and led by local governments.</p>
<p>[-Before doing anything else, the polisher deleted "of the Central People's Government" as a self-evident modifier. There is only one "Ministry of Agriculture," and it is by definition a ministry of the central government.</p>
<p>-She then turned her attention to the question of emphasis. The point of the passage (from a speech given in the early 1950s) was that even though many government functions were to be centralized, local governments would still have an important role to play.</p>
<p>-But in A-version the placement of the subordinate clause ("after the Ministry of Agriculture... has laid down") undercut the main message.</p>
<p>-To correct this, the polisher moved the subordinate clause up, leaving final place in the sentence to the affirmation of the continuing responsibilities of local governments.</p>
<p>-Lastly, she clarified the logic of the argument by inserting "still."]</p>
<p>9) A: It seems almost a rule that an organization, no matter how intelligent and capable its leading members may be, will mostly be affected by bureaucratism <u>so long as it has an overextended structure and is staffed by too many people</u>
 . The reason is that when an organization has become overstaffed due to its over-expansion, quite a number of its personnel will spend their time doing nothing but indulging in idle talk....</p>
<p>B: It seems to be a rule that no matter how intelligent and capable its leading members may be, <i>if an organization is overexpanded and consequently overstaffed,</i>
 it will be affected by bureaucratism. That is because in such an organization many people will spend all their time in idle talk....</p>
<p>[-On reading A-version, the polisher first became aware of the qualifiers "almost" and "mostly."Neither one seemed necessary, so she deleted them both.</p>
<p>-Next, she was troubled by the repetition of ideas. "When an organization has become overstaffed due to its over-expansion" seemed to be only a thinly disguised restatement of the immediately preceding "so long as it has an over-extended structure and is staffed by too many people."</p>
<p>-She therefore condensed the two clauses into one: "if an organization is overexpanded and consequently overstaffed," followed by "such an organization."</p>
<p>-It was only after this tightening that the polisher considered the order of clauses in the first sentence. She saw that the revised subordinate clause ("if an organization is overexpanded etc."), coming at the end of the sentence, usurped the place of the main clause ("it will be affected by bureaucratism").</p>
<p>-Accordingly, she reversed the order of the two clauses. This change placed the emphasis on the important point and, at the same time, made a better logical connection between the two sentences. "It will be affected by bureaucratism" was now directly followed by "That is because... ."]</p>
<p>10) <i>From</i>
 Asiaweek:</p>
<p>A: China's leaders have made their intentions clear. "China will not devalue the yuan <u>for the sake of its own economic development and economic stability in Asia</u>
 ," premier-in-waiting Zhu Rongji said last month.</p>
<p>B: China's leaders have made their intentions clear. <i>"Both for the sake of its own economic development and for the sake of economic stability in Asia,"</i>
 premier-in-waiting Zhu Rongji said last month, "China will not devalue the yuan."</p>
<p>[-The translation of Zhu Rongji's remarks that appeared in the magazine was plainly made by a person who did not recognize that the word order was faulty from the point of view of both logic and emphasis.</p>
<p>-The statement, "China will not devalue the yuan for the sake of its own economic development," suggests at first that China will devalue the yuan for some other reason. There is nothing in the sentence to correct this impression.</p>
<p>-In addition, the crucial announcement that China will not devalue its currency is buried by the long explanation that comes after it.</p>
<p>-As indicated in B-version, a careful editor could have solved the problem of logic by moving the prepositional phrase ("for the sake of etc.") to the beginning of the sentence, where its meaning would have been unmistakable.</p>
<p>-That change would also have solved the problem of emphasis. The important news would have been left to the end of the quotation and, indeed, to the end of the sentence, with nothing following to diminish its impact.]</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Dangling Modifiers</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>11) A: Gao also stated that his office had finished drafting a document entitled Administrative Measures for the Implementation of the Patent Law and Regulations, which has been presented to the State Council for review. <u>Once adopted</u>
 , patent violators will face tougher administrative penalties, and patent enforcement bodies will have more power in law enforcement.</p>
<p>B: Gao also stated that his office had finished drafting a document entitled Administrative Measures for the Implementation of the Patent Law and Regulations, which has been presented to the State Council for review. <i>Once these measures are adopted,</i>
 patent violators will face tougher administrative penalties, and the bodies that enforce the patent laws will have more power.</p>
<p>[-Seeing the past participle at the beginning of the second sentence in A-version ("Once adopted"), the polisher immediately looked for the word it modified, which should have been the subject of the clause. It was not. What she found instead was "patent violators will face etc. ," with no mention anywhere of what was to be "adopted."</p>
<p>-She solved this problem easily by converting the participial phrase to a separate clause with its own subject, "measures," the word that "adopted" was intended to modify. (To avoid repeating the long title of the document, she used the demonstrative adjective "these.")</p>
<p>-The polisher hesitated over the noun-used-as-adjective construction "patent enforcement bodies," which was perhaps acceptable, but decided it would be more readily understood if it were spelled out as a clause: "bodies that enforce the patent laws."</p>
<p>-Lastly, considering that if these law enforcement bodies were given more power, it could only be more power to enforce the law, she deleted "in law enforcement" as self-evident.]</p>
<p>12) A: <u>Based on</u>
 data gathered at the epicenter [of an earthquake in Hebei], construction experts should finish designs for the buildings by the end of next month.</p>
<p>B: Construction experts expect that the building <i>designs, which are based</i>
 on data gathered at the epicenter, will be finished by the end of next month.</p>
<p>[-The polisher saw that in A-version the opening participial phrase ("Based on") attached itself to the subject of the sentence ("experts"), which, however, was not the word it logically modified. It was not the "construction experts" that were based on the seismological data but the "designs" for the new quake-resistant houses.</p>
<p>-To eliminate the dangling participial phrase she discarded it and substituted a subordinate clause: "Construction experts should finish designs for the buildings, which are based on data gathered at the epicenter, by the end of next month."</p>
<p>-That solved one problem, but it created another: the "which" attached itself not to the "designs," as she had intended, but to the intervening "buildings."Thus, it was no longer the "experts" that were based on the data but the "buildings," a reading that was just as wrong.</p>
<p>-The solution, she saw, was to place the true antecedent of "which"—the "designs"—immediately before the pronoun, so that the connection between them would be unmistakable: "Construction experts should finish the building designs, which are based on data gathered at the epicenter, by the end of next month."</p>
<p>-The sentence now said what the Chinese author meant it to say, but the polisher thought it would be easier to read if "by the end of the month" were not so far removed from the verb it modified, "should finish."</p>
<p>-To bring the two related elements closer, she made a slight change of wording: "Construction experts expect that the building designs, which are based on data gathered at the epicenter, will be finished by the end of next month."]</p>
<p>13) A: The draft report was printed and distributed to 135 work units at central and local levels <u>soliciting</u>
 their opinions <u>based on</u>
 a decision made by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on July 10 this year.</p>
<p>B: <i>In accordance with</i>
 a decision made by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on July 10, <i>the drafting group</i>
 printed the draft report and distributed it to 135 work units at central and local levels, <i>soliciting</i>
 their comments.</p>
<p>[-The polisher saw at once that in A-version the present participle "soliciting" was afloat without an expressed subject: it was not the draft report that solicited opinions on itself. To solve this problem she introduced "the drafting group" to be the subject of "soliciting."</p>
<p>-"Based on" plainly had no true subject to lean on either and consequently attached itself to the wrong one. Thus, it appeared to be the work units' opinions that were based on the decision of the Politburo.</p>
<p>-The polisher dropped the participial construction "based on" and replaced it with a simple and appropriate prepositional phrase, "In accordance with."</p>
<p>-Then, to put the main point (that comments were solicited) in the place of emphasis at the end of the sentence, she moved the subordinate idea (the decision on which this action was based) to the beginning.]</p>
<p>14) A: "<u>By employing</u>
 state-of-the-art building techniques, it is expected that newly built houses in the quake-devastated areas will be able to withstand earthquakes of eight degrees of seismic intensity," Tian [a spokesman for the Ministry of Construction] said.</p>
<p>B: <i>"By employing</i>
 state-of-the-art building techniques," Tian said, "<i>we</i>
 expect to make the new houses in the quake-devastated areas able to withstand eight degrees of seismic intensity."</p>
<p>[-As soon as she saw the introductory gerund "by employing," the polisher looked for its implied subject. It was nowhere to be found. The subject of "employing" could not be "it is expected," far less "newly built houses."</p>
<p>-The people employing the advanced techniques could only be the builders or planners at the Ministry of Construction for whom Tian was speaking. The polisher therefore introduced the pronoun "we" to represent them.]</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Parallel Structure</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>15) A: <u>The volume of money in circulation</u>
 and <u>credit</u>
 will be kept at a level beneficial to <u>stabilizing</u>
 the value of the renminbi and to economic <u>growth</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: <i>The volume of money in circulation</i>
 and <i>the amount of credit available</i>
 will be kept at a level that will <i>stabilize</i>
 the value of the renminbi and <i>encourage</i>
 economic growth.</p>
<p>[-The polisher first noticed that in A-version the two subjects joined by the coordinating conjunction "and" were out of balance: "the volume of money in circulation" and "credit."</p>
<p>-To achieve greater parallelism, as well as greater clarity, she expanded the second term to "the amount of credit available."</p>
<p>-She then found that "beneficial to" was followed by two objects also joined by "and" but also ill-matched: "stabilizing the value of the renminbi" (a gerund with its own object) and "economic growth" (a noun without an object).</p>
<p>-In the interest of parallel structure, she again changed the second term to match the first: "stabilizing the value of the renminbi and encouraging economic growth."</p>
<p>-She then realized that "beneficial to" was as objectionable as "characterized by" and for the same reason: it trapped the writer into following with a noun or gerund.</p>
<p>-Accordingly, she replaced it with a verb structure that expressed the same idea more directly and with equal parallelism: "a level that will stabilize x and encourage y."]</p>
<p>16) A: Mutual <u>resentment</u>
 , <u>monopolizing</u>
 everything in one's own hands, <u>going</u>
 it alone and <u>refusing</u>
 to cooperate with others, mutual <u>contempt</u>
 and worse still, <u>engaging</u>
 in splittist activities—all such behavior must be prevented among the cadres.</p>
<p>B: <i>Resenting</i>
 other cadres, <i>monopolizing</i>
 everything in one's own hands, <i>acting</i>
 independently and <i>refusing</i>
 to cooperate, <i>holding</i>
 other nationalities in contempt or, worse still, <i>engaging</i>
 in splittist activities—all such behavior must be prevented.</p>
<p>[-The polisher saw that A-version was based on an awkward and haphazard mixture of nouns and gerunds connected by the coordinating conjunction "and."In this case, she felt, it would be better to stick to one or the other.</p>
<p>-She also saw that the translator had not decided whether to talk about one person or two. "Mutual resentment" and "mutual contempt" could only refer to the reciprocal attitude of two persons, whereas "monopolizing everything in one's own hands" and "going it alone" plainly referred to the behavior of a single individual. Thus, readers were repeatedly asked to change their point of view.</p>
<p>-The polisher changed the nouns to gerunds, producing a series of parallel items that was both more satisfying to the ear and easier to understand.</p>
<p>-At the same time she introduced further consistency by making all the items refer to the behavior of one person only. "Mutual resentment" readily became "resenting other cadres," and "mutual contempt" became "holding other nationalities in contempt," an interpretation justified by preceding material.]</p>
<p>17) A: In short, <u>making</u>
 concessions on our part will only alleviate the internal contradictions among the enemy, whereas our <u>intervention</u>
 will bring about an aggravation of their contradictions.</p>
<p>B: In short, <i>if we make concessions,</i>
 it will only alleviate the internal contradictions among the enemy, whereas <i>if we intervene,</i>
 it will aggravate those contradictions.</p>
<p>[-The polisher first changed "bring about an aggravation" (an unnec. verb + noun) to the plain-verb equivalent, "aggravate."With that detail out of the way, she turned to the structural problem.</p>
<p>-The two clauses compared alternative courses of action—a classic construction calling for parallelism. In A-version, however, the first clause had a gerund for a subject ("making") and the second a noun ("intervention"), a combination that was tolerable but scarcely satisfactory.</p>
<p>-The polisher converted both subjects to verbs ("we make," "we intervene"). These changes not only enhanced the parallelism but also, by avoiding the noun plague, substituted two easy and natural expressions for two stiff and awkward ones.</p>
<p>-She also tried to avoid the repeated reference to "contradictions," by replacing the second mention with a pronoun. This produced "if we make concessions, it will only alleviate the internal contradictions among the enemy, whereas if we intervene, it will aggravate them."</p>
<p>-But she abandoned that version as soon as she reread it. The pronoun "them," intended to refer to "contradictions," tried to attach itself instead to the nearer plural noun, suggesting the meaning "it will annoy the enemy. " Better to repeat the noun than to substitute a potentially misleading pronoun.]</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Logical Connectives</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>18) A: The third phase of the campaign lasted from December 15, l948, to January 10, 1949. The chief objective now was to wipe out Du Yuming's forces. In order to coordinate this action with the Beiping-Tianjin campaign, in the beginning of this phase the PLA troops on the front line of the Huai-Hai campaign were ordered to stop their attack on Du's army for two weeks to give Fu Zuoyi's army on the North China front a false sense of security.</p>
<p>B: The third phase of the campaign lasted from December 15, l948, to January 10, 1949. The chief objective now was to wipe out Du Yuming's forces. <i>However,</i>
 in order to coordinate this action with the Beiping-Tianjin campaign, in the beginning of this phase the PLA troops on the front line of the Huai-Hai campaign were ordered to stop their attack on Du's army for two weeks to give Fu Zuoyi's army on the North China front a false sense of security.</p>
<p>[-The second sentence in A-version said that the chief objective of this phase of the campaign was to wipe out Du Yuming's forces. With no notice to the contrary, the polisher assumed that the next sentence would tell her how this operation was set in motion.</p>
<p>-Instead, it said that for tactical reasons, the PLA troops in Du's area were, on the contrary, ordered to halt their attack on him.</p>
<p>-To prepare readers for this seeming contradiction, the polisher introduced a "However."]</p>
<p>19) A: It can be seen from the planned levying and expenditures for public grain that there will be a surplus of 10. 5 billion <i>jin,</i>
 or the equivalent of RMB 1, 023 billion. Cash expenditures are expected to total 3, 062 billion yuan. Using the tax receipts and surplus public grain to defray this expense, we will still have a deficit of 288. 8 billion yuan.</p>
<p>B: It can be seen from the planned receipts and expenditures of public grain that there will be a surplus of 5. 25 billion kg., or the equivalent of ￥1, 023 billion. <i>But</i>
 cash expenditures are expected to total ￥3, 062 billion. <i>So even</i>
 using the tax receipts and surplus public grain to defray this expense, we will still have a deficit of ￥288. 8 billion.</p>
<p>[-After scanning A-version, the polisher first made the easy changes of form. She converted <i>jin</i>
 to kilograms, a more familiar measure in English. (This is not always necessary; it depends on the style preferred by the publication you are writing for. )</p>
<p>-Next she made "RMB" and "yuan" consistent. She changed both to the standard “￥” corresponding to the symbols used in English for dollars and pounds—“$” and “￡.”(This also is a question of house style, but whatever form is chosen, it should be used consistently. )</p>
<p>-Turning then to the substantive problems of A-version, the polisher found that the three sentences appeared to state three unrelated facts. To tie them together and thus clarify the point being made, she introduced words that expressed the logical connections that were only implied in the original: "But" and "So even."]</p>
<p>20) A: The guiding general principle of national economic development—<u>with</u>
 agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor—must be applied to obtain better results.</p>
<p>B: We must do better in applying the guiding principle of [national] economic development, <i>namely, that</i>

<h3 id="c2">Twenty more exercises</h3>
<p>Many of the following exercises are more complex than those offered in preceding chapters, because they contain more than one element needing revision. This, of course, is very often the case in "real-life" polishing.</p>
<p>Consequently, you must keep a sharp lookout not only for examples of the structural faults discussed in Part Two but also for examples of the unnecessary words studied in Part One.
