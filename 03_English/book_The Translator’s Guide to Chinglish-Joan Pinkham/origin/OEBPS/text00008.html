<title>IV. Saying the Same Thing Twice</title>
</head>
<body style="font-family:cnepub,serif;">
<h2>IV. Saying the Same Thing Twice</h2>
<p>As we have seen, there is a governing principle of English usage that rejects unnecessary duplication. We have examined many individual words and short phrases, typical of Chinglish, that are condemned by this principle—“temporary <u>in nature</u>
 ," "<u>new</u>
 innovation," "help <u>and assistance</u>
 ," etc. Now we shall look at some larger groups of words, including whole clauses, to which it also applies.</p>
<p>This principle, which the American authority on usage Wilson Follett [p. 377] calls "the maxim against redundancy," insists that no idea should be expressed twice in the same passage. In English, sentences that present as new information something that has just been said, or that is plainly implied in what has just been said, are considered a waste of the reader's time. The more frequently such sentences occur, the more they clog the flow of ideas and the more annoying they become.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most forceful condemnation of needless repetition is expressed by the British writers Robert Graves and Alan Hodge [p. 103]: "Unless for rhetorical emphasis, or necessary recapitulation, no idea should be presented more than once in the same prose passage.... [R]epetitiveness is nowadays considered a sign of pauperdom in oratory, and of feeble-mindedness in narrative."</p>
<p>Other advisers on English likewise make a point of warning writers not to repeat themselves. That is because even educated native speakers are often tempted to say the same thing twice, and because the effect is generally deplorable.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>-An American banker (cited by Claire Cook [p. 15]) can hardly say anything without at once restating it in other words. Thus, he refers to "<u>unprecedented</u>
 interest rates that <u>set an all-time record</u>
 ."He thanks stockholders for having "<u>assisted</u>
 us with their <u>help</u>
 ."And he reports that his institution has "<u>continued</u>
 to <u>maintain</u>
 success since the <u>outset</u>
 of our <u>entry</u>
 into the computer field."</p>
<p>-A U. S. politician, Vice-President J. Danforth Quayle, gained a reputation in the early 1990s as a master of mindless repetition. Indeed, he is still remembered for many solemn redundancies that provided much amusement to newspaper readers. These included profundities like "A <u>low voter turnout</u>
 [in an election] is an indication of <u>fewer people going to the polls</u>
 ," and "If we <u>don't succeed</u>
 , we <u>run the risk of failure</u>
 ."</p>
<p>-Even journalists, who, as professional writers, should know better, sometimes produce twin statements that convey what is perfectly self-evident. A user of the Internet has drawn attention to such newspaper headlines as "If Strike <u>Isn't Settled Quickly</u>
 , It <u>May Last a While"</u>
 and "Enfields <u>Couple Slain</u>
 ; <u>Police Suspect Homicide</u>
 ."</p>
<p>There are times, of course—as Graves and Hodge concede—when it is entirely legitimate to state an idea twice over. Repetition for emphasis, for example, is an ancient and honorable device. But to be effective it must be used deliberately and, above all, sparingly. In draft translations from Chinese, the times when it is superfluous far outnumber the times when it is useful.</p>
<p>Accordingly, when you are revising a translation you should be constantly on the watch for unnecessary repetitions. Any word or group of words that states the same thing expressed elsewhere in a sentence is quite probably redundant.</p>
<h3 id="c1">Forms of repetition in Chinglish</h3>
<p>A study of many draft translations reveals that the repetition of ideas in Chinglish appears in one of the three following forms:</p>
<p>1. simple restatement (same idea presented twice in different words)</p>
<p>2. self-evident statement (one idea implicit in another)</p>
<p>3. mirror-image statement (same idea presented first in positive form, then in negative)</p>
<p>Let us consider each of these.</p>
<p>1. <i>
<u>Simple restatement</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>This sort of repetition is already familiar: it is only an expanded version of a pair of redundant twins. Instead of two words that mean virtually the same thing, we have two parts of a sentence that mean virtually the same thing. Usually, the pattern is: "we must <u>arrive at the station on time</u>
 and <u>be punctual</u>
 ."Here are some examples:</p>
<p>-we must <u>practice economy</u>
 and <u>reduce unnecessary expenditures</u>
</p>
<p>-We must be clear whether a mistake has really been made and if it has, we must be able to tell <u>whether it is a major or a minor one</u>
 and <u>whether it is serious or not</u>
 .</p>
<p>-in industrial production we should maintain <u>a policy of safety first</u>
 , with <u>prevention of accidents as our main concern</u>
</p>
<p>Sometimes the conjunction joining the two parts of the sentence is not "and" but "in order to."This produces a statement that is essentially circular, on the pattern "we must <u>arrive at the station on time</u>
 in order to <u>be punctual</u>
 " :</p>
<p>-we must further <u>strengthen the building of national defense</u>
 in order to <u>enhance our defense strength</u>
</p>
<p>-it is essential to <u>control environmental pollution</u>
 so as to <u>protect the environment</u>
</p>
<p>No doubt the reason these "circular" sentences turn up in draft translations is that often there is nothing in the Chinese to indicate the logical relation between the two parts of the sentence. With no clear guidance from the original, the translator is obliged to insert a conjunction on his or her own—"and" or "in order to" (sometimes even "or"). Unfortunately, none of these can solve the basic problem, which is the double statement itself.</p>
<p>2. <i>
<u>Self-evident statement</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>In this type of repetition, one part of the sentence, while it is not just another version of the other, is nevertheless implicit in it. The result is a statement in which one element is so obvious that it can be taken for granted. The patterns vary, but the most common one is: "we must <u>arrive at the station on time</u>
 in order to <u>catch the train</u>
 " :</p>
<p>-By renovating and expanding a number of chemical fertilizer plants, we shall increase the output of standard fertilizer by 15 million tons in the five-year period.... Meanwhile, to <u>increase soil fertility</u>
 , we should <u>promote widespread scientific application of fertilizer and greater use of farm manure</u>
 .</p>
<p>["To increase soil fertility" (like "to catch the train") goes without saying. The reader does not need to be told that the purpose of applying fertilizer and manure is to make soil more fertile.]</p>
<p>-we should reduce taxes on enterprises so as to <u>allow them to retain more of their profits</u>
 and thus <u>increase their financial capacity</u>
</p>
<p>[Plainly, if enterprises are allowed to keep more of their profits, they will be stronger financially. It is not necessary to spell this out.]</p>
<p>-China's socialist <u>system of law has now been basically established,</u>
 so that the <u>situation in which there were no laws has changed</u>
</p>
<p>[It is obvious that a situation in which there are laws is different from a situation in which there were none.]</p>
<p>3. <i>
<u>Mirror-image statement</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>In this construction, the same idea is stated first in positive form, then in negative (or vice versa). The second part of the sentence is only a mirror image of the first—the identical picture presented from the opposite point of view. Here, the pattern is: "we must <u>arrive at the station on time</u>
 and <u>not be late</u>
 " :</p>
<p>-We should <u>pay close attention to</u>
 the formulation of annual plans and <u>not neglect it</u>
 .</p>
<p>-we must <u>maintain our vigilance</u>
 and <u>never be off guard</u>
</p>
<p>-financial expenditures should be <u>arranged in order of priority</u>
 , <u>rather than be given equal status</u>
</p>
<h3 id="c2">Dealing with repetition in translations</h3>
<p>Confronted with a repetition of ideas in an English translation, you should begin by asking some questions. Was the repetition intentional in the original, or did the Chinese writer merely slip unconsciously into a cliché pattern? If the repetition was used deliberately to provide emphasis, is there a better way to achieve that effect in English? How many times has the same construction already appeared in this piece? If I use it here, will it serve to make a point, or will it just sound... well, "feeble-minded" ?</p>
<p>The answers to such questions will help determine whether the repetition is useful in English. If you decide that it is not, you have four options:</p>
<p>1. find further (or different) meaning in the original</p>
<p>2. delete the redundant words</p>
<p>3. change the wording</p>
<p>4. let the repetition stand</p>
<p>1. <i>
<u>Finding further (or different) meaning</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>First, you should re-examine the original Chinese. Perhaps it will yield another element of meaning, one which the translator has misunderstood or overlooked and which, if introduced into the English version, will eliminate the redundancy. For example:</p>
<p>A: this shows that all advanced <u>means of communication</u>
 and <u>communications equipment</u>
 are controlled by the people, so the difficulties of the past no longer exist</p>
<p>B: this shows that all advanced <i>means of transportation</i>
 and <i>communication</i>
 are controlled by the people, so the difficulties of the past no longer exist</p>
<p>[-Simple restatement: "communications equipment" = "means of communication."A closer study of the original suggested that "communication" should be understood as "transportation," in the sense that roads are means of "communication."Also, that "equipment" had been introduced only in an attempt to make a distinction from "communication."</p>
<p>-In short, the repetition of ideas was due only to a misunderstanding of the Chinese. A more thoughtful reading produced a perfectly acceptable sentence in English.]</p>
<p>A: We must continue to <u>strengthen basic research</u>
 and <u>increase scientific</u>
 and technological <u>strength</u>
 and staying power for future development.</p>
<p>B: <i>To enhance our ability to make further advances</i>
 in science and technology, we must continue to <i>expand basic research.</i>
</p>
<p>[-Again, simple restatement: "increase scientific strength" = "strengthen basic research."Reviewing the Chinese, the polishers decided that (1) "strength and staying power" were merely redundant twins; (2) "strength for future development" meant the ability to continue making progress; and, most important, (3) the logical connection (unexpressed in Chinese) between "strengthen basic research" and "increase scientific strength" was not <u>and</u>
 but <u>in order to</u>
 .</p>
<p>-This reinterpretation of the original made it possible to eliminate the repetition of ideas and, by so doing, to clarify an exceedingly vague statement.]</p>
<p>Revisions of this sort, in which the redundancy in English is removed thanks to the discovery of further (or different) meaning in the Chinese, are the most successful. Unfortunately, they are not always possible.</p>
<p>2. <i>
<u>Deleting the redundant words</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>If you cannot find more sense in the original, the next best solution is to delete one of the repetitive elements or replace them both with another expression:</p>
<p>A: He stressed that all State Council departments <u>have an important responsibility</u>
 in the struggle [against corruption] and said they <u>are in a very important position</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: He stressed that all State Council departments <i>have an important responsibility</i>
 in the struggle.</p>
<p>[Since the second clause ("they are in a very important position") is only a simple restatement of the first ("departments have an important responsibility"), it can be omitted without sacrificing any element of substance. This kind of judicious pruning is no more radical than deleting one of two redundant twins.]</p>
<p>A: Has the political status of the Shanghai workers undergone any change since Liberation? Yes, it has, and <u>the change is an essential</u>
 , <u>not an insignificant one</u>
 , for they have changed from members of an exploited class into members of a ruling class.</p>
<p>B: Has the political status of the Shanghai workers undergone any change since Liberation? Yes, it has, and <i>the change is absolutely fundamental,</i>
 because they are no longer members of an exploited class but members of a ruling (<i>or:</i>
 leading) class.</p>
<p>[Both elements of this mirror-image statement can be replaced by a single strong expression ("the change is absolutely fundamental") that more neatly conveys not only the meaning of the Chinese but also the intended emphasis.]</p>
<p>3. <i>
<u>Changing the wording</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>In principle, the decision to cut or not to cut should be made on purely technical considerations—how best to convey the sense of the Chinese in English. In practice, however, you may feel obliged to take into account the nature of the text and its intended audience.</p>
<p>Is this an article addressed to the casual readers of a general-interest magazine, or is it an official pronouncement that will be closely studied abroad in foreign ministries or in corporate headquarters? Is this just a spontaneous remark, or is it a quotation from a prepared speech? And so on.</p>
<p>When dealing with an important text—a legal document, say, or a formal statement by a government spokesman—you may feel you lack the authority to "correct" even an obviously useless repetition. In that case, you may still try to make the repetition less obtrusive by a change of wording:</p>
<p>A: people of all the different nationalities have made enormous contributions to <u>safeguarding the unity</u>
 of the motherland and <u>promoting</u>
 stability and <u>unity</u>
 and prosperity</p>
<p>B: people of all the different nationalities have contributed enormously to <i>safeguarding the unity</i>
 of the motherland and <i>promoting</i>
 stability, <i>solidarity</i>
 , and prosperity</p>
<p>A: to <u>maintain steady growth of the economy</u>
 , we must implement a long-term <u>policy of steady economic growth</u>
</p>
<p>B: to <i>keep the economy growing</i>
 we must implement a long-term <i>policy favorable to steady economic development</i>
</p>
<p>Both of these examples are, basically, simple restatements. Despite the changed language in the B-versions, a careful reader may recognize that the author is only saying the same thing twice. In the first example, "safeguarding unity" and "promoting solidarity" are barely distinguishable notions. And in the second, the revision still boils down to "to maintain steady growth, we must have a policy of steady growth."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, versions like these are more acceptable because they are less obviously redundant.</p>
<p>4. <i>
<u>Letting the repetition stand</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>Sometimes, especially with statements of the mirror-image type, a case can be made for retaining the repetition on the ground that it provides needed emphasis:</p>
<p>-Speaking of the diverse cultures around the world, Jiang said, "It is <u>a good thing</u>
 , <u>not a bad thing</u>
 , that the world is a diverse and colorful place."</p>
<p>-there is no question that <u>we will win</u>
 and <u>the enemy will be defeated</u>
</p>
<p>And even where the necessity for the positive/negative construction is debatable, you may wish to give a writer the benefit of the doubt, so as to reflect his or her characteristic style and way of thinking. Translators of the works of Chairman Mao, for example, have generally respected his mode of expression:</p>
<p>-The Chinese people, now at the high tide of revolution, need friends, and they should <u>remember their friends</u>
 and <u>not forget them</u>
 .</p>
<p>-In agriculture, those labour-exchange teams and organizations, which were in the grip of bureaucrats and which <u>harmed the people</u>
 <u>instead of benefiting them</u>
 , have all collapsed.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, a repetition may be allowed to stand not because it serves a useful purpose in English, but simply because, for the reasons suggested above, the translator is reluctant to cut, and no other solution is available. The result is seldom satisfactory:</p>
<p>-we must work hard to <u>gain professional proficiency</u>
 and <u>become skilled in our work</u>
</p>
<p>-we must <u>strengthen public health services</u>
 in rural areas in order to <u>improve our people's health</u>
</p>
<p>In these examples (both taken from published documents), one half of the statement tells readers something they already know, either because they have just been told it (simple restatement in the first case), or because it is perfectly obvious (self-evident statement in the second).</p>
<p>Constructions of this sort, although they are grammatically correct and "faithful" renderings of the Chinese, are nevertheless to be avoided wherever possible. Not only are they full of unnecessary words but, worse, they cast doubt on the value of the text as a whole. When readers find that a considerable part of what the writer is saying is not worth listening to, they are unlikely to pay much attention to the rest.</p>
<h3 id="c3">Twenty more examples of revision</h3>
<p>This section follows the same format that has been used in corresponding sections in chapters I through III.</p>
<p>1) A: We should <u>exercise centralized control</u>
 over the management of foreign exchange and foreign debts and <u>centralize such power</u>
 <u>in the hands of central authorities</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: We should <i>place the power to manage</i>
 foreign exchange and foreign debt <i>in the hands of the central authorities.</i>
</p>
<p>[Three statements of the same idea can be easily reduced to one.]</p>
<p>2) A: In areas that are suitable for grain growing, <u>a good job must be done in grain production</u>
 and <u>efforts be made to raise per-unit yield, increase variety, and improve quality</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: In areas that are suitable for the production of grain, <i>we must try to raise per-unit yield, increase variety, and improve quality.</i>
</p>
<p>[-It is hard to see what "doing a good job in grain production" could mean other than achieving the three goals mentioned.</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : To "make efforts" is only the unnec. verb + noun form of "to try.")]</p>
<p>3) A: Naturally, the Chinese side resolutely <u>opposed the propositions</u>
 and <u>did not accept them</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: <i>Since</i>
 the Chinese side firmly <i>opposed the propositions, naturally it refused to accept them</i>
 .</p>
<p>[-In A-version the two statements are virtually identical in meaning. To remedy this, the polisher reinterpreted the original: <u>because</u>
 the Chinese side was against the propositions, it rejected them.</p>
<p>-This new understanding, expressed in the conjunction "since," produced an acceptable revision that differentiated between "opposed" and "did not accept."]</p>
<p>4) A: After the decision made at the August 7th [1927] Meeting to wage armed resistance against the butchery policy of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the fundamental question of <u>how to achieve the victory</u>
 in armed struggle and <u>what road the revolution should take</u>
 lay before the Party.</p>
<p>B: After the decision made at the August 7th Meeting to resist the murderous policies of the Kuomintang reactionaries with armed struggle, the fundamental question before the Party was <i>how to achieve victory</i>
 in that struggle.</p>
<p>[-At this stage of history the question "what road should the revolution take?" could only mean "what must we do to achieve a military victory over the KMT?" In A-version the second expression is only a metaphor for the first and can therefore be edited out.</p>
<p>-(Note that since "armed resistance" = "armed struggle," one of them can also be dispensed with. )]</p>
<p>5) A: Party organizations must <u>set up a centralized leadership</u>
 in each guerrilla area <u>and remedy the lack of centralized leadership</u>
 where the working group, the county Party committee, and the guerrilla forces are operating separately.</p>
<p>B: In each guerrilla area the Party organization must <i>set up a centralized leadership to remedy the lack of coordination</i>
 between the working group, the county Party committee, and the guerrilla units.</p>
<p>[-Plainly, to establish an institution = to remedy the lack of it.</p>
<p>-By introducing a "to," indicating purpose, and the key word "coordination," the polisher not only eliminated a pointless repetition but clarified the central idea.]</p>
<p>6) A: <u>The large numbers</u>
 [of Hui people] <u>are due to</u>
 their assimilation of other ethnic groups, <u>which contributes to their population growth</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: <i>Their large numbers are due to</i>
 their assimilation of other ethnic groups.</p>
<p>[-A-version says that the population is large because of a factor (assimilation) that contributes to a large population. The logic is as circular as in Dan Quayle's remark that "a low voter turnout is an indication of fewer people going to the polls."</p>
<p>-Since the entire subordinate ("which") clause merely repeats the sense of the main clause in different words, it was edited out.]</p>
<p>7) A: it is essential to <u>delegate powers of</u>
 operation and <u>management</u>
 to enterprises and institutions so as to <u>let them manage their own affairs</u>
 in accordance with the principle of <u>having full authority for management</u>
 and administration</p>
<p>B: it is essential to <i>delegate powers of</i>
 operation, <i>management</i>
 , and administration to enterprises and institutions, so as to <i>let them manage their own affairs with full authority</i>
</p>
<p>[-In A-version, the same idea is presented not twice but three times.</p>
<p>-B-version, while it is an improvement, still contains a repetition (to "delegate powers of management" to enterprises = to "let them manage their own affairs"). However, the sentence appeared in a government report, and the polishers did not feel authorized to cut it further.]</p>
<p>8) A: Our policy is <u>unswerving</u>
 and <u>will not be shaken</u>
 , and <u>we shall always follow it</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: Our policy <i>will not change,</i>
 and <i>we shall always follow it.</i>
</p>
<p>[-Again A-version says the same thing three times over, and again B-version still says it twice.</p>
<p>-But here the polishers were satisfied with the revision, because the repetition seemed justified to match the speaker's intended emphasis.]</p>
<p>9) A: The Party member <u>must put the interests of the revolution and the Party first</u>
 , dealing with all his personal problems in accordance with the principle that <u>the interests of the revolution and the Party are paramount</u>
 , <u>instead of placing his own interests above those of the revolution and the Party</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: The Party member <i>must put the interests of the revolution and the Party first,</i>
 dealing with all his personal problems in accordance with the principle that <i>those interests are paramount.</i>
</p>
<p>[-Another instance in which the same idea was expressed in three different ways, of which the polishers eliminated only one (the mirror-image "instead of" clause).</p>
<p>-Here they thought the idea that the general interests must come first was usefully reinforced by being restated as a principle.</p>
<p>-("Those interests" was used in the B-version to avoid repetition of the long phrase "of the revolution and the Party.")]</p>
<p>10) A: We should <u>speed up housing construction</u>
 in cities and towns, especially the building of medium and low-grade housing estates, <u>so as to improve the housing conditions</u>
 of the inhabitants there.</p>
<p>B: We should <i>speed up construction of</i>
 urban <i>housing,</i>
 especially medium-and low-income (<i>or</i>
 : low-cost) units.</p>
<p>[-The construction of housing clearly implies the desire to improve housing conditions, so there is no need to state its purpose.</p>
<p>-(“Low-grade" was changed because the term means low quality—shoddy workmanship, poor materials, etc. )]</p>
<p>11) A: We should improve techniques of raising animals and reward the development of better breeds. In order to <u>prevent</u>
 and cure <u>animal diseases</u>
 and <u>improve animal breeds</u>
 , we should set up <u>disease-prevention organizations</u>
 and <u>breeding stations</u>
 in a planned way.</p>
<p>B: We should improve techniques of raising livestock and reward the development of better breeds. We should draw up plans for <i>establishing breeding stations</i>
 and <i>centers for the prevention</i>
 and treatment <i>of animal diseases.</i>
</p>
<p>[-The only possible purpose of a disease-prevention organization is to prevent disease. Breeding stations are obviously designed to improve breeds, and in any event, this has been made clear in the preceding sentence.</p>
<p>-Again, the entire content of the subordinate ("in order to") clause is self-evident.]</p>
<p>12) A: All this means that the advances in science and technology will decide fundamentally the progress of China's modernization and <u>are an important matter</u>
 <u>on which hinges the future and destiny of our nation.</u>
</p>
<p>B: All this means that advances in science and technology will basically determine the progress of China's modernization and that the <i>revitalization of our nation hinges upon them.</i>
</p>
<p>[-Any factor on which the future of the nation depends is obviously important, and there is no need to say so.</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : "Future and destiny" = redundant twins. While "revitalization" is not an obvious equivalent, the context made it clear that that was the intended meaning. )]</p>
<p>13) A: Within the people's governments, the standard for judging whether a person who performs official duties is competent to handle financial and economic affairs is not merely that of <u>embezzlement or honesty</u>
 . <u>The former is a crime, and the latter is essential</u>
 . The principal standard is whether one is wasteful or not.</p>
<p>B: In the people's governments, the criterion for judging if a cadre is competent to handle financial and economic affairs is not merely whether he is honest or commits embezzlement. <i>Of course, embezzlement is a crime and honesty is indispensable,</i>
 but the principal criterion is whether he is wasteful.</p>
<p>[-In A-version the second statement—that embezzlement is a crime and honesty is essential—seems entirely self-evident.</p>
<p>-Rather then omit it, however, the polishers decided simply to reduce its importance.</p>
<p>-In B-version the statement is merely a preliminary to the following sentence, which makes the speaker's new and important point. By starting with "Of course," he recognizes that he is saying something that everyone knows.</p>
<p>-("But" was added to provide the logical connection between the two ideas, which was not stated in the Chinese. )</p>
<p>-(Note that a "person who performs official duties" in a local government can be designated by many shorter names, depending on the historical period: a cadre, an official, a functionary, a staff member, a government employee, a civil servant, etc. )]</p>
<p>14) A: Private capital has to meet two conditions to make profits: First, <u>illegal profits are not allowed</u>
 , <u>only legal ones are allowed</u>
 . Second, <u>excessive profits are not acceptable</u>
 , <u>only reasonable profits are allowed</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: To be allowed to make profits, private capital has to meet two conditions: 1) <i>the profits must be legal,</i>
 and 2) they must not be excessive.</p>
<p>[In each case, the second or mirror-image statement adds nothing to the sense of the first. It was therefore edited out.</p>
<p>-(Note, incidentally, that "illegal" in English has a very strong and precise meaning: something that is "illegal" is literally "unlawful," or against the law, and is therefore forbidden by definition. Consequently, to say "illegal profits are not allowed" is to say no more than "profits that are not allowed are not allowed."This sort of statement, technically known as a truism, tells readers nothing they do not already know. )]</p>
<p>15) A: Meanwhile, <u>China began to export technology</u>
 , which means that <u>we are no longer restricted to importing technology</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: Meanwhile, <i>China's technology began to enter the international market,</i>
 which means that <i>we are no longer restricted to importing technology.</i>
</p>
<p>[Again the second statement says exactly the same thing as the first and could in principle be omitted. But here the polishers, dealing with a carefully prepared government document, contented themselves with changing the wording to make the repetition less obtrusive.]</p>
<p>16) A: During the period of the Seventh Five-Year Plan <u>we must in no way neglect</u>
 , <u>even in the slightest degree</u>
 , the production of grain, <u>but should keep it growing</u>
 steadily.</p>
<p>B: During the period of the Seventh Five-Year Plan <i>we must never neglect</i>
 grain production. <i>On the contrary, we must steadily increase it.</i>
</p>
<p>[-In this example, the mirror-image statement serves the legitimate function of providing emphasis. The revised version ("on the contrary") heightens the effect by underlining the contradiction.</p>
<p>-"In the slightest degree" = "in no way," and "never" is strong enough to reflect the sense of both. )]</p>
<p>17) A: After public grain and taxes are placed under the administration of the Central People's Government, local comrades should not only <u>refrain from adopting a passive and irresponsible attitude</u>
 toward financial and economic work, but also <u>show a more active and responsible attitude</u>
 toward it.</p>
<p>B: After public grain and taxes are placed under the administration of the Central People's Government, comrades in local governments, <i>far from losing interest in</i>
 financial and economic work, <i>should take even greater responsibility</i>
 for it.</p>
<p>[-Here the contradiction between the two "attitudes" (passive/ irresponsible vs. active/responsible) is an important element.</p>
<p>-The revised version ("far from") retains that element but eliminates the tiresome mirror images and, at the same time, clarifies the meaning.</p>
<p>-(Note that both "attitudes" have disappeared and been replaced by more precise, concrete expressions. )</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : To "show a responsible attitude" is one of the constructions discussed in Chapter I: unnec. verb + unnec. noun + third word. Here the "third word" is the adjective "responsible," which expresses the real action, to "take responsibility.")]</p>
<p>18) A: Compared with the more than a hundred million workers and staff members in state-owned enterprises and institutions of the whole country, <u>the number of hired workers is very small</u>
 . Judging from the situation as a whole, <u>their number is only a very small one</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: Compared with the more than a hundred million workers and administrative personnel in public enterprises and institutions throughout the country, <i>the number of privately hired workers is very small. In terms of the overall situation, there are only very few of them.</i>
</p>
<p>[-Here the polishers were able to solve the problem of repetition by means of a better interpretation of the original.</p>
<p>-In A-version the second sentence appears to add nothing to the sense of the first. A closer reading of the Chinese, however, suggested that "judging from the situation as a whole" (which the reader slides over as almost meaningless) should rather be "in terms of the overall situation."</p>
<p>-With this change, the second sentence could be understood as a legitimate repetition, reinforcing the idea expressed in the first. Still, to avoid repeating the identical words, the polishers changed "their number is only a very small one" to "there are only very few of them."</p>
<p>-(For greater clarity, "privately" was inserted before "hired workers" and, to underline the difference, "state-owned" was changed to "public.”)</p>
<p>-("Staff members" was changed to "administrative personnel" because in English all employees of an organization, both white-collar and blue-collar, are usually considered to be on the "staff" of the organization. )]</p>
<p>19) A: Things <u>are getting better</u>
 with us every passing day and <u>can't be getting worse</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: Things <i>are getting better</i>
 for us with every passing day, and <i>the tide of progress cannot be turned back.</i>
</p>
<p>[-Plainly, if things are getting better, they can't be getting worse. The mirror-image construction simply doesn't work.</p>
<p>-When a translator has unwittingly produced a sentence as pointless as this one, it suggests that he or she has either misunderstood the Chinese or made a mistake in English.</p>
<p>-In this instance, it proved to be the latter. What the translator had meant to say was "things <u>are getting</u>
 better (now) and they can't <u>get</u>
 worse (in future)."This new understanding quickly led to a sensible B-version.]</p>
<p>20) A: China's strategy for scientific and technological development must be both forward-looking and far-sighted, and <u>it must serve the development of the present and future</u>
 , <u>not the past</u>
 , Zhou said.</p>
<p>B: China's strategy for scientific and technological development must be both forward-looking and far-sighted, and <i>it must be adapted to the present and the future, not the past.</i>
</p>
<p>[-Here the mirror-image construction itself was reasonable enough (present and future vs. past), but by choosing the wrong verb the translator had inadvertently turned it into nonsense: how can a strategy for (future) development "serve" the past?</p>
<p>-Again, once the problem had been identified, it was not hard to find a solution.]</p>
