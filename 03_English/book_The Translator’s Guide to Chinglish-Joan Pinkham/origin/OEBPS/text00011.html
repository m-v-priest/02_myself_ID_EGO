<h1>Part Two: Sentence Structure</h1>
<p>In Part One we dealt with various types of unnecessary words. All the chapters in that part related to one central concern: the need to make an English sentence concise.</p>
<p>In Part Two we shall deal with various aspects of sentence structure. All the chapters in this part will relate to another central concern: the need to make an English sentence clear and logical.</p>
<p>The faults we shall consider in Part Two are, in general, harder to identify and harder to remedy than those we studied in Part One. But by the same token, they are more interesting. And once we have named and analyzed these mistakes, you will be able to recognize and correct them, just as you have learned to recognize and correct unnecessary words.</p>
