<h1>Key to Exercises</h1>
<p>Following are revisions of the examples of Chinglish that appear in the twenty exercises at the end of each chapter.</p>
<p>Remember that we are not dealing with problems in mathematics, which have a single correct solution that can be proved. In matters of translation there can be no "proof," and the versions decided on by the revisers may not always be the best in your opinion.</p>
<p>In a given example you may think the reviser was wrong to eliminate or retain a particular element of the draft sentence. Or, confronting the same problem of structure, you may have found a different way of turning the sentence that is equally acceptable or, perhaps, preferable.</p>
<p>In short, you are not obliged to accept the versions proposed below. You should, however, be able to defend your own.</p>

<p>13) If we want to get 90 per cent of the people to join mass organizations, we must pay special attention to women.</p>
<p>14) However, China is short of some minerals crucial to economic development, and this means that Chinese geologists are facing a tough task.</p>
<p>15) Because the Party failed to draw the lesson of the uprisings in Nanchang and Guangzhou, the political line at that time still encouraged insurrections everywhere.</p>
<p>16) Construction of the new project, which will cover an area of 1. 3 square kilometers, is expected to start this year and to be completed in five stages over the next eight years.</p>
<p>17) Wang and her colleagues have been working to make the center, which is a non-profit, non-governmental mass organization, do more than just help women with their troubles.</p>

<p>19) Some time ago in Shanghai, in an effort to streamline administration the staff was reduced.</p>
<p>20) In studying <i>putonghua,</i>
 you can't just rely on your ears and tongue, because it is easy to forget what you have learned. For more efficient study there must be books printed in a phonetic alphabet and dictionaries giving the phonetic transcription of each character....</p>

<h3 id="c11">XI. Parallel Structure</h3>
<p>1) "The three most important tasks for the Liberated Areas," the Central Committee declared, "are training soldiers, reducing rents, and increasing production."</p>
<p>(<i>Or, better:</i>
 "The three most important tasks for the Liberated Areas," the Central Committee declared, "are to train soldiers, reduce rents, and increase production.")</p>
<p>2) So far the Political Consultative Conference has concentrated mainly on political study, international activities, and the collection of historical records.</p>
<p>3) After his divorce and the death of his parents, Lei Fachun, an ethnic Tu farmer in Huzhu County, Qinghai Province, felt hopeless about the prospect of feeding his three sons.</p>

<p>6) Senior cadres of the various departments and organizations are not familiar with our current financial difficulties and the means to overcome them.</p>
<p>7) Consequently, some workers are losing their jobs and need to receive relief or to turn to other trades.</p>
<p>8) The difference of opinion was not only over the special economic zones but also over the larger issues, such as the rural reform that introduced the household contract responsibility system....</p>
<p>9) He fell in love with automotive design not because he foresaw the rise of the auto industry as one of the country's pillar industries, but because he believed that auto design represented the highest level of industrial design.</p>
<p>10) 1) Sharing the burden</p>
<p>2) Restoring production</p>
<p>3) Broadening sources of income and reducing expenditures</p>
<p>4) Having a good grasp of policies</p>
<p>(<i>Or, better:</i>
 Understanding policies)</p>
<p>11) These are vital questions for the next century, both for enhancing people's quality of life and for protecting the environment.</p>
<p>12) But over the past year we have seen leading manufacturers of automobiles joining hands with producers of farm vehicles in an attempt to tap into this market.</p>
<p>13) Nevertheless, by 1978 the average monthly salary for our workers was still only 45 yuan, and the people in most of our rural areas were still mired in poverty.</p>
<p>14) When faced with aggression by the Japanese imperialists, one party in China was for resisting while the other party was for making concessions.</p>
<p>15) During the first eight months of this year, 54, 000 units were produced and 52, 000 were sold.</p>
<p>16) Even at the time when our army had only millet to eat and only rifles to fight with, he began to envisage combined operations of the various services.</p>
<p>17) Only through this process can a man develop his thinking, a party formulate a complete set of policies, and an organization improve its work.</p>
<p>18) The dictatorship was to be based... mainly on the alliance of workers and peasants, because those two classes were the main force in overthrowing imperialism and feudalism and in making the transition from new-democracy to socialism.</p>
<p>19) Since this law went into effect, it has won broad support from the people and has achieved excellent results.</p>
<p>20) Perhaps they migrated to distant regions outside China; perhaps they were assimilated with the Han or other ethnic groups and lost their separate identity.</p>
<h3 id="c12">XII. Logical Connectives</h3>
<p>1) The vast majority of workers, city dwellers, and even members of the middle and lower petty bourgeoisie were brought to the brink of disaster. The rural economy <i>also</i>
 went into a sharp recession.</p>
<p>2) If the North-South problem is not solved, it will hinder the development of the world economy. The solution, of course, lies in North-South dialogue, and we support dialogue. But dialogue alone is not enough; cooperation among Third World countries—in other words, South-South cooperation—should be stepped up <i>as well.</i>
</p>
<p>3) There is no doubt that the system of management described above is much more centralized than the one that was in effect last year. <i>But</i>
 if we were asked how many undertakings will still be under decentralized management, we would have to answer, a great many.</p>
<p>4) At first, the Yangtze Automotive Chassis Plant will be able to assemble 60, 000 chassis a year for one-and two-ton trucks. <i>When construction is completed,</i>
 it will have an annual capacity of 100, 000 chassis.</p>
<p>5) It is not necessary to launch such a movement now. In Shanghai 160, 000 cases of tax evasion have been uncovered <i>but</i>
 most of them are medium or minor ones. These cases of tax evasion vary in seriousness, and there are also defects in our tax system. These things have to be addressed and rectified, but there is no need for a lesser movement against the "five evils."</p>
<p>6) Not much progress has been made in the talks on control of nuclear arms and of weapons in outer space. That's why for many years we emphasized the danger of war. Recently, <i>however,</i>
 there have been some changes in our views. We now think that although there is still the danger of war, the forces that can deter it are growing, and we find that encouraging.</p>
<p>7) Some people think that since China is emphasizing the importance of ideals, that means it is going to close its doors again. That is not true. We are soberly aware of the possible negative effects of the open policy and will not ignore them. <i>Nevertheless,</i>
 our principle is not to close but to continue to open. We may open even wider in the future.</p>
<p>8) At that session we criticized the idea of the "two whatevers" and put forward <i>instead</i>
 the slogan, "We must emancipate our minds and put our brains to work."</p>
<p>9) All local authorities and departments should make the improvement of the performance of large and medium-sized state enterprises an important item on their agendas, taking practical measures to create a favorable environment for their production and operation and to help them reduce losses and increase profits. Basically, <i>however,</i>
 state enterprises must rely on their own efforts to extricate themselves from their predicament. While actively carrying out the reform, they should adjust their mix of products to conform to the demands of domestic and international markets, produce readily marketable goods, keep developing new products, and enhance their ability to adapt to the market and compete.</p>
<p>10) Changchun has now reached an annual production capacity of 400, 000 automobiles, <i>including</i>
 over 100 models of medium trucks, light vehicles and sedans.</p>

 the fact that command over the Northern Expeditionary Army was largely in Chiang's hands made it clear that <i>although</i>
 the revolution was progressing rapidly, it was already in a serious crisis.</p>
<p>12) If China, with its one billion people, took the capitalist road, it would be a disaster for the world. It would be a retrogression of history, a retrogression of many years. If China, with its one billion people, abandoned the policy of peace and opposition to hegemonism or if, as the economy developed, it sought hegemony, that would also be a disaster for the world, a retrogression of history. <i>But</i>
 if China, with its one billion people, keeps to socialism and adheres to the policy of peace, it will be following the right course and will be able to make greater contributions to humanity.</p>
<p>13) "Graft, bribery, and other cases of corruption have become (quite) serious, <i>and</i>
 crimes involving the exchange of power for money are spreading among some government departments and officials," Liang told a national conference of provincial procurators on Wednesday. "So, we must focus attention on such developments, <i>and</i>
 not underestimate the seriousness of the threat posed by corruption."</p>
<p>14) Shen says that research and production of friction materials for motor vehicles in China had always been based on asbestos, which is both cheap and plentiful in the country. At present there are close to 30 manufacturers with a total annual production of more than 20, 000 tons of friction materials, most of which are made from asbestos. Realizing, <i>however,</i>
 that asbestos was a hazardous substance and that international manufacturers were no longer using it, Shen made up her mind to develop China's own non-asbestos materials.</p>
<p>15) Zhou announced at the reception that he had asked Hu Zongnan personally if he had sent his troops defending the Yellow River west to prepare an attack on the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. "Deputy Commander Hu told me," he said, "that he had no intention of attacking the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and that the troops under his command would take no such action. I was very happy to hear this, and I believe everyone else will be happy, too."<i>Thus</i>
 Hu's scheme to attack the region was made known to the public.</p>
<p>16) The museum, <i>which has</i>
 a 30-year history, is dedicated to the collection of items related to ancient China, Chinese paintings and calligraphy, historical pictures, and contemporary Hong Kong art.</p>
<p>17) If the CPC were to give up its proletarian stand of independence and initiative, make no distinction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, refrain from arousing the masses, and try to appease the bourgeoisie in all matters so as to maintain the united front, it would only weaken the position of the proletariat, put the united front at the mercy of the bourgeoisie, and eventually bring about China's defeat. <i>Nevertheless,</i>
 after he arrived in Yan'an, Wang Ming did everything possible to carry out this "new policy" of the Communist International.</p>
<p>18) The objective reasons were as follows.... Many of the troops that had previously been engaged in attempts to encircle and suppress the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army were moved to other battlefields to take part in [the warfare between the new rival warlords], leaving a vacuum in certain areas and an opportunity for the Red Army to grow. <i>Moreover (or, better:</i>
 What is more), under the rule of the KMT government, the national crisis was aggravated. Every one of the fundamental contradictions in Chinese society became intensified, and the Nanjing government grew increasingly fascist... Discontent was growing even among those who had cherished illusions about the KMT.</p>
<p>19) The principal contradiction in Chinese society in the present stage is the one between the growing material and cultural needs of the people and the backwardness of production. <i>Accordingly,</i>
 to promote the all-round progress of society, we must give priority to the growth of the productive forces and make economic development our central task.</p>
<p>20) The venture, named Huazhong-Warner Transmission Co., Ltd., has a total investment of ￥255 million ($30. 72 million), <i>of which</i>
 Borg-Warner is contributing 60 percent.</p>
<h3 id="c13">XIII. Summing it All Up</h3>
<p>1) In the Northeast the enemy is still strong and we are still weak.</p>
<p>2) This has aggravated the internal contradictions in the capitalist camp, helped to consolidate and expand the camp of peace and democracy, and strengthened the national and democratic movements in capitalist countries.</p>
<p>3) As we don't have nearly enough technicians, it is very important to train more of them.</p>
<p>4) "Running an operation in China is a great challenge and requires a lot of patience and long-term planning," says Kuang-Ming Lin, president of Dana China. "However, China has a fast-growing economy that offers some good business opportunities."</p>
<p>(<i>Or:</i>
 ... "However, the Chinese economy is growing fast, and it offers some good business opportunities.")</p>
<p>5) There is nothing to fear if the imperialists refuse to do business with us. Their past invasions turned China into a colonial and semi-colonial country. The Chinese people rose up to make revolution because that was the only way they could survive. We certainly cannot rely on the imperialists now.</p>
<p>6) Non-staple foods are daily necessities for people living in the cities and in industrial and mining areas. Indeed, such people consume more non-staple foods than staple ones.</p>
<p>7) A legal aid organization for young people was opened in Guangzhou on Wednesday, China News Service reported. On the same day, the organization launched the Jibuhuan Yunlai Legal Aid Fund.</p>
<p>8) On March 3 the Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued a Decision on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work.</p>
<p>9) A senior financial official reaffirmed yesterday that despite China's having achieved a "soft landing," the ultimate objective of the country's monetary policy is to keep currency values stable.</p>
<p>10) During a meeting with World Bank President James Wolfensohn, Li, who arrived in Hong Kong on Saturday afternoon to attend the annual meeting of the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund, said China hoped to strengthen cooperation with the Bank.</p>
<p>11) What first appears to visitors entering the town is a spread of green bamboo and lawns dotted here and there with beautifully designed houses, clearly showing the wealth and taste of the homeowners.</p>
<p>(<i>Or:</i>
 The first thing visitors see on entering the town is a spread of green bamboo.... )</p>
<p>12) Compared to a regular automobile, a farm vehicle costs much less (<i>or:</i>
 is much cheaper) to operate.</p>
<p>13) As an outstanding strategist, Bocheng demonstrated his perspicacity not only in directing battles but also in working to build a modern, regular army.</p>
<p>14) To distribute the precious water better among provinces along the river and utilize it more efficiently, we should construct more water conservancy facilities.</p>
<p>15) Encouraged by the strong market demand, Beijing Jeep Corporation has set a sales target of 80, 000 units for this year and 100, 000 for next year. During the first eight months of 1995, 54, 000 units were produced and 52, 000 were sold.</p>
<p>16) The required training period for the driver of a car is six months, that for the driver of a farm vehicle only three months.</p>
<p>(<i>Or, better:</i>
 For the driver of a car, the required training period is six months; for the driver of a farm vehicle it is only three. )</p>
<p>17) We should know not only how to use the modern equipment but also how it works.</p>
<p>18) When you have built more apartment houses, the people will have a better environment to live in.</p>
<p>19) The loans will be interest-free. Guarantees will be required, however, before they are granted.</p>
<p>20) At that time I was in charge of the work of the Central Committee and the government, and I introduced a series of rectification measures. Before long these measures produced excellent results in every area, but they ran counter to the "cultural revolution" and angered the Gang of Four. So once again I was ousted from office.</p>
