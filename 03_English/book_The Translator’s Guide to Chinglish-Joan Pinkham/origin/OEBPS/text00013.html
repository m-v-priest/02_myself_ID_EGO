<title>VIII. Pronouns and Antecedents</title>
</head>
<body style="font-family:cnepub,serif;">
<h2>VIII. Pronouns and Antecedents</h2>
<p>As you will recall from your studies, there are many different types of pronouns in English. Grammar books distinguish seven or eight, but here we need concern ourselves with only three—the ones that are generally used to replace nouns.</p>
<p>These three are as follows:</p>
<p>-<u>personal pronouns</u>
 : I, you, he, she, it, we, they (plus their objective and possessive forms—me/my/mine, him/his, etc. )</p>
<p>-<u>relative pronouns</u>
 : which, that, who/whom/whose, etc.</p>
<p>-<u>demonstrative pronouns</u>
 : this, that, these, those</p>
<p>Many examples of the use of such pronouns have already been given in Chapter V, Repeated References to the Same Thing. It will be useful to recall two of them (from pages 127 and 140－141/535):</p>
<p>A: We have not met with too many difficulties in the course of <u>the reform</u>
 , and in general <u>the reform</u>
 is proceeding smoothly.</p>
<p>B: We have not met with too many difficulties in the course of <i>the reform</i>
 , and in general <i>it</i>
 is proceeding smoothly.</p>
<p>A: We failed to attach equal importance to both <u>types of work</u>
 , and there was no proper coordination between the two <u>types of work</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: We failed to attach equal importance to both <i>types of work</i>
 , and there was no proper coordination between <i>them.</i>
</p>
<p>These are simple examples. Presented with a second reference to "the reform" or to "types of work," any advanced student of English would recognize the need for a pronoun to avoid repetition and would have no trouble selecting the right one.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, pronouns are not always so easy to handle; even for native speakers of English, their use presents numerous pitfalls. Jacques Barzun, whose book <i>Simple</i>
 and <i>Direct</i>
 is primarily addressed to educated American adults, begins his remarks on the subject [p. 75] with an ominous subtitle, "Pronouns: The slightest slip is fatal," and a warning that the reader is about to enter "the dangerous wilderness of Pronouns."</p>
<p>For native speakers of Chinese, the difficulties with English pronouns are compounded by the differences between the two languages. As you know, pronouns are used in many places in English where they are not required in Chinese. Indeed, some English pronouns—the relatives, for instance ("which," "that," "who," etc. )—do not even have Chinese equivalents. Also, most pronouns in English have more forms to choose from than do the corresponding pronouns in Chinese.</p>
<p>It is only to be expected, then, that Chinese who have not yet gained a complete mastery of English might make mistakes in using pronouns. In fact, they often do. In this chapter we shall examine the most common types of errors and discuss how to correct them.</p>
<h3 id="c1">Correct use of pronouns</h3>
<p>Early on in your study of English you learned that certain pronouns (the personal pronouns and "who") had different "cases"—that is, that their form varied according to their grammatical function. For native speakers of Chinese, which seldom makes such distinctions, case is no doubt a difficult notion at first. But by now, it can be assumed, you automatically use the right forms: "he," "they," "who," etc. for the subject of a verb; "him," "them," "whom," etc. for its direct or indirect object; "his," "their," "whose," etc. for the possessive.</p>
<p>Using the correct case is a great help to readers, because it shows them what role the pronoun plays in the grammatical structure of the sentence. But that is not all they need to know. If readers are to understand what you have written, they also need to be certain what noun the pronoun is replacing.</p>
<p>Every pronoun—whether or not its form varies with case—must have a clear, logical antecedent. And that antecedent must be a stated word that readers can immediately recognize as the one to which the pronoun refers. Otherwise, they will be either confused or, worse, misled.</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Rules governing the use of antecedents</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>Barzun [p. 75] describes the problem of providing clear antecedents for pronouns as "the greatest difficulty in the writing of English prose."This difficulty will be much reduced, however, if you bear in mind four common-sense rules.</p>
<p>To be clear, the antecedent of a pronoun must be:</p>
<p>1. explicitly stated (not merely implied)</p>
<p>2. unambiguous (not possibly one word, possibly another)</p>
<p>3. close to the pronoun (not so far away that the connection between the two words is hard to perceive)</p>
<p>4. in grammatical agreement with the pronoun (i. e., in the same "person," number and gender)</p>
<p>Returning to the examples cited above, we find that in both revisions all four of these rules have been respected:</p>
<p>B: We have not met with too many difficulties in the course of the <u>reform</u>
 , and in general <u>it</u>
 is proceeding smoothly.</p>
<p>[-1. <i>Explicit:</i>
 The antecedent of the pronoun "it" is stated earlier: "reform."</p>
<p>-2. <i>Unambiguous:</i>
 There is no other word in the sentence that the pronoun could refer to.</p>
<p>-3. <i>Nearby:</i>
 The antecedent "reform" comes only a few words before the pronoun "it."</p>
<p>-4. <i>In agreement:</i>
 The pronoun "it" agrees with its antecedent, "reform," in person (both are third person), in number (both are singular), and in gender (both are neuter). This grammatical agreement cements the bond between the two words.]</p>
<p>B: We failed to attach equal importance to both <u>types</u>
 of work, and there was no proper coordination between <u>them</u>
 .</p>
<p>[-1. <i>Explicit:</i>
 The antecedent of the pronoun "them" is plainly stated: "types."</p>
<p>-2. <i>Unambiguous:</i>
 No other noun is competing for the role of antecedent (there are no other plural nouns).</p>
<p>-3. <i>Nearby:</i>
 The antecedent "types" is close to the pronoun "them."</p>
<p>-4. <i>In agreement:</i>
 The pronoun "them" agrees with its antecedent, "types," in person (both are third person), in number (both are plural), and in gender (both are neuter). Again, the grammatical agreement confirms the close relation between the two words, indicating that they mean the same thing.]</p>
<p>We shall now consider examples of the problems that arise for readers when the antecedent of a pronoun is <i>not</i>
 clear—that is, when one or another of these four rules has been neglected.</p>
<h3 id="c2">1. When antecedents are not explicitly stated</h3>
<p>If the antecedent of a pronoun is not clear, most often it is simply because the antecedent is missing. It may be implied, but it is not present on the page.</p>
<p>When a pronoun has no stated antecedent, it will either a) remain unattached, or b) attach itself to some word that it was not intended to refer to. Consequently, the reader trying to understand the sentence in question will either a) be left in doubt, or b) mistake the sense.</p>
<p>Following are examples of both kinds of errors.</p>
<p>a) <i>
<u>Unattached pronouns: reader is left in doubt</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>Here is a simple example of a pronoun which, having no expressed antecedent, remains afloat:</p>
<p>-The second question concerns close planting. <u>It</u>
 should neither be spread out too thinly nor planted too closely.</p>
<p>Since the subject of the second sentence was only implied in the Chinese, the translator supplied one, the pronoun "it."But he or she neglected to provide an antecedent.</p>
<p>The polisher, a more experienced translator, discarded the pronoun and introduced a specific noun to serve as the subject, even though the equivalent character did not appear in the original:</p>
<p>-The second question concerns close planting. <i>Crops</i>
 should be neither spread out too thinly nor planted too closely.</p>
<p>In this instance, a reader of the draft version could probably have guessed what the first translator meant. Often, however, a pronoun without an expressed antecedent can be genuinely baffling. Here is another "it" left unattached:</p>
<p>-The shareholding system and joint stock partnership which have been introduced in China over the past few years have also raised doubts among some people. They can get an answer from Jiang Zemin's report to the recently completed 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China held last week—<u>it</u>
 is because China is in the primary stage of socialism.</p>
<p>Could any reader of this paragraph tell what "it" represents—in other words, <u>what</u>
 is to be explained by the fact that China is in the primary stage of socialism? Since the nature of the "doubts" is never specified, the reader does not know what question is answered by the statement, "it is because China is in the primary stage of socialism."</p>
<p>There are several possible meanings. One is that the shareholding system and joint stock partnership are <u>necessary</u>
 because China is in the primary stage of socialism. Another is that those institutions are <u>legitimate</u>
 because China is in this stage. Another is that they are only <u>temporary</u>
 or <u>experimental</u>
 for that reason. It is impossible to tell.</p>
<p>This passage, which appeared in a Chinese publication, was probably not translated from Chinese but written directly in English. Since we cannot refer to an original Chinese text to establish the meaning, it is not possible to suggest a revision. The example is cited here only to show how a pronoun for which no antecedent is provided can make a sentence unintelligible.</p>
<p>b) <i>
<u>Wrongly attached pronouns: reader mistakes the sense</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>In both of the examples just given (“<u>It</u>
 should neither be spread out too thinly etc."and "<u>it</u>
 is because China is in the primary stage etc.”), the pronoun, having no stated antecedent for an anchor, simply remains adrift. More often, however, a pronoun with a missing antecedent will fasten onto some other word that <i>is</i>
 available.</p>
<p>A pronoun that is separated from its true partner has a tendency to form an attachment to any potential mate at hand. (In this respect, it resembles the fellow in the song who candidly confesses, "When I'm not near the girl I love, I love the girl I'm near.") And when that happens, the reader is inevitably given the wrong impression.</p>
<p>Following is an example with a personal pronoun, "his."It is the draft version of a footnote identifying a text that appeared in Volume I of the <i>Selected Works of Zhou Enlai:</i>
</p>
<p>-Minutes of an interim telephone report to <u>Mao Zedong</u>
 during <u>his</u>
 investigation in Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province.</p>
<p>The true antecedent of "his"—the person making the investigation—is Zhou Enlai. But Zhou is nowhere to be seen, and the pronoun attaches itself instead to the person who is visible on the page, Mao Zedong. The reader's inevitable interpretation is that Mao is the one doing the investigating.</p>
<p>Since all the pieces in this book were the works of Premier Zhou, the polishers thought it was unnecessary to specify who had written this one. Accordingly, in the published version the misleading pronoun was simply omitted:</p>
<p>-Minutes of an interim report telephoned to Mao Zedong during an investigation in Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province.</p>
<p>Here is another example of a pronoun which, given no true antecedent, tries to tie itself to a false one. This time, it is the demonstrative pronoun "this" :</p>
<p>- The Shanghai chapter of the Democratic National Construction Association, the Shanghai Association of Industrialists and Merchants for Progress, and the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce, among others, issued statements in support of the students' patriotic actions and demanded the <u>withdrawal</u>
 of U. S. troops. <u>This</u>
 became a broad-based people's movement, a united front against the U. S. and Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<p>Although "this" can sometimes be used to refer not just to a single word but to the whole idea expressed in a preceding clause or sentence, in this instance it is not clear what that idea might be. Is it the fact that these organizations issued statements? That they demanded withdrawal of the foreign troops? No—because neither of those elements could become a "movement."Since the translator has provided no antecedent for "this," it attaches itself to the nearest preceding singular noun: "withdrawal."</p>
<p>Thus, the readers' first impression is that the <u>withdrawal</u>
 of the foreign troops became a broad-based people's movement. Since that reading makes no sense, their next thought is that it was the <u>demand</u>
 for withdrawal of the troops that became a broad-based people's movement. But there is no "demand" on the page—only "demanded," which cannot serve as the antecedent of "this" because it is not a noun but a verb. So that interpretation cannot be right either. At this point, even an interested reader is likely to give up on the sentence and move on.</p>
<p>When the polisher came upon this problem, he studied the original Chinese passage in context. It was clear to him that the translation was misleading. "This" was indeed intended to refer to the whole preceding sentence. It was supposed to mean "All this"—that is, all the actions taken by other sectors of society. Only, those actions themselves did not "become" a broad-based movement; the sense was rather that they helped to form one.</p>
<p>On the basis of that understanding, he was able to revise the sentence, dispensing with the ambiguous "This" :</p>
<p>- The Shanghai chapter of the Democratic National Construction Association, the Shanghai Association of Industrialists and Merchants for Progress, and the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce, among others, issued statements in support of the students' patriotic actions and demanded the withdrawal of U. S. troops. <i>All this</i>
 helped form a broad-based people's movement, a united front against the U. S. and Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>The missing subject</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>No doubt the frequent appearance in Chinglish of pronouns without antecedents is due to the elliptical nature of the Chinese language. As you know, compared to English, Chinese relies much more on readers to grasp ideas that are not actually spelled out.</p>
<p>For example, Professor Cheng Zhenqiu points out [p. 68] that in Chinese "the grammatical subject is often left out if it can be inferred from the context."He goes on to say that because such an omission is generally unacceptable in English, the translator often has to supply a missing subject. Providing instructive examples—including some in which pronouns were wrongly introduced and others where it was judged better to leave the subject vague—Professor Cheng concludes with the warning [p. 72]: "supplying logical subjects is a very delicate matter and requires a good deal of caution."</p>
<p>That does not mean, however, that you should be discouraged from introducing into an English sentence a subject (or any other element) that is absent from the original but can be "inferred from the context" by Chinese readers. On the contrary, it is precisely the translator's duty to identify those ideas that a native speaker of Chinese understands by implication and to give them overt expression in English.</p>
<p>Admittedly, that is harder (and riskier) than to evade the difficulty by simply supplying a vague "it" or "this," in the hope that readers will somehow "get the idea."But if you make the effort, you will be rewarded with the knowledge that you have met the challenge and successfully communicated the Chinese author's meaning—in other words, that you have produced a professional piece of work.</p>
<h3 id="c3">2. When antecedents are ambiguous</h3>
<p>If there is more than one word in a sentence to which a pronoun might refer, readers may not be sure which is the intended antecedent. Here is an example:</p>
<p>- Since the purchase of grain is mostly entrusted to state <u>companies</u>
 , and grain <u>traders</u>
 are allowed to carry no more than 50 <i>jin</i>
 with them, <u>their</u>
 regulating role is restricted.</p>
<p>In this sentence it is not clear whose regulating role is restricted. Does "their" refer to "companies," to "traders," or to both? The simplest way to dispel the doubt is to abandon the pronoun and, referring again to the original to determine the sense, use the noun it was supposed to replace. Better a repetition than an ambiguity:</p>
<p>- Since the purchase of grain is mostly entrusted to state companies, and grain traders are allowed to carry no more than 50 <i>jin</i>
 with them, the <i>traders</i>
 ' regulating role is restricted.</p>
<p>[<u>Review</u>
 : In the final version, in order to replace the abstract noun "role" with a verb and, at the same time, to clarify the meaning, the reviser changed the end of the sentence to: "the traders can do little to regulate the market."]</p>
<p>Antecedents can be even more ambiguous when the same pronoun appears twice in one passage but refers to two different things. Readers are then left on their own to match up the pairs correctly. Consider the following sentence:</p>
<p>- The <u>price</u>
 of one <u>ton</u>
 of crude oil is 1, 300 yuan ($175) on the market, while <u>it</u>
 is only 800 yuan ($96) if <u>it</u>
 is sold to the government.</p>
<p>There is nothing to indicate that the first "it" refers to the "price" of oil, while the second refers to the "ton" being sold. Readers will no doubt understand what the writer means, but only because they either slide over the shift in antecedents or backtrack and make the mental correction.</p>
<p>A careful reviser would have recast the sentence in such a way that both pronouns had the same antecedent:</p>
<p>-The price of one <i>ton</i>
 of crude oil is 1, 300 yuan ($175) if <i>it</i>
 is sold on the market but only 800 yuan ($96) if <i>it</i>
 is sold to the government.</p>
<p>It is hard to recognize ambiguous antecedents in one of your own sentences, because you know what you meant when you wrote it. Remember, though, that your readers do not, and that you should try to leave them no opportunity to mistake your meaning.</p>
<h3 id="c4">3. When antecedents are too remote</h3>
<p>When a pronoun stands too far away from its antecedent, readers may fail to connect the two words. And when the antecedent is too remote, just as when it is missing, the fickle pronoun will very probably cling to another, closer word, distorting the meaning.</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Personal pronouns</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>Here is an example with a personal pronoun, "they" :</p>
<p>- In the meantime, <u>the U. S. government</u>
 increased its aid to <u>the KMT government</u>
 . In March 1946 the United States successively organized army and navy advisory <u>teams</u>
 . On June 17 <u>they</u>
 signed the Sino-American Lend-Lease Agreement, which transferred 51. 7 million U. S. dollars' worth of military equipment to the KMT government.</p>
<p>There is only one possible way to understand the "they" in the third sentence: it represents the immediately preceding "teams."But that understanding is quite wrong—it was not the military advisory teams that signed this high-level agreement.</p>
<p>In the revision, the pronoun "they" was dropped and replaced by the true subject of the sentence:</p>
<p>-In the meantime, the U. S. government increased its aid to the KMT. In March 1946 the United States successively organized army and navy advisory teams. On June 17 <i>the two governments</i>
 signed the Sino-American Lend-Lease Agreement, which transferred 51. 7 million U. S. dollars' worth of military equipment to the KMT.</p>
<p>Here is another example of a personal pronoun ("their") so far removed from the word it is meant to refer to that the reader mistakes its meaning:</p>
<p>- Li Yili points out that these northern <u>tribes</u>
 were still in the early stage of feudalism or slavery when they conquered the Han-Chinese populated areas where feudalism had enjoyed its zenith. The refined literature and the wanton lifestyle of the noble <u>Han Chinese</u>
 were too powerful to resist, while maintaining <u>their</u>
 own military might became a burden.</p>
<p>It is virtually impossible to read this passage without getting the impression that the Han Chinese were finding it a burden to maintain their military might. It takes at least a second reading to realize that the "their" in the last clause is meant to refer to the northern "tribes" that appeared at the beginning of the preceding sentence. By the time the reader reaches "their own," he or she has already forgotten the "tribes," and the recent mention of "Han Chinese" (also plural) makes them a plausible candidate for the role of antecedent.</p>
<p>It would not have been hard to clarify the meaning of this passage. A polisher would only have had to repeat the noun "tribes," placing it nearer to the pronoun than the competing "Han Chinese" and thus making it the obvious antecedent of "their" :</p>
<p>-Li Yili points out that these northern tribes were still in the early stage of feudalism or slavery when they conquered the areas populated by Han-Chinese, where feudalism was at its zenith. The refined literature and luxurious lifestyle of the noble Han Chinese were too powerful for <i>the tribes</i>
 to resist, while <i>they</i>
 found it an increasing burden to maintain <i>their</i>
 own military might.</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Relative pronouns</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>The examples just discussed show that to prevent misunderstanding, personal pronouns ("they," "their," etc. ) must stand close to their antecedents. The same principle applies with even greater force to relative pronouns ("which," "that," "who," etc. ).</p>
<p>Readers encountering a relative pronoun assume not just that it will be somewhere near the element it refers to, but that it will come immediately after that element. The following examples show the expected arrangement of words:</p>
<p>- Jiang has instructed legal departments to severely punish <u>lawbreakers</u>
 <u>who</u>
 have been involved in making and dealing in illegal alcoholic drinks.</p>
<p>-The main peak of this range, <u>Mount Qogir</u>
 , <u>which</u>
 stands outside the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to the northwest, is second in elevation only to Qomolangma.</p>
<p>This unconscious expectation on the reader's part—that the relative pronoun will refer to the immediately preceding noun—is very strong. So strong that if any other noun intervenes between the true antecedent and the relative pronoun, the pronoun will—again—affix itself to that one, whether the connection is logical or not. As may be seen from the following three examples, the result can completely subvert the writer's meaning.</p>
<p>1) First, a simple example taken from a native source (a U. S. newspaper):</p>
<p>-Wanted: Man to take care of <u>cow</u>
 <u>that</u>
 does not smoke or drink.</p>
<p>The intended antecedent of "that" is the "man" whose services are being sought in the advertisement. Unfortunately, the pronoun attaches itself to the intervening noun, thus describing the blameless habits of the cow.</p>
<p>To connect the pronoun "that" to the right antecedent, one would only have to move the relative clause—which is merely a misplaced modifier—next to the noun it logically modifies:</p>
<p>- Wanted: <i>Man</i>
 <i>that (or, better:</i>
 who) does not smoke or drink to take care of cow.</p>
<p>2) Now, a more complex example taken from Chinglish:</p>
<p>- In October of the same year [1976], the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee took decisive measures to shatter <u>the Gang of Four</u>
 , in <u>which</u>
 he [Hua Guofeng], Ye Jianying, Li Xiannian, and others played an important role.</p>
<p>In this sentence the translator is trying to use "which" not to represent a single word but to sum up a whole preceding idea. Like the similar use of "this" mentioned on page 209 above, the practice can be useful, and it is generally considered acceptable.</p>
<p>But such a construction works only when the antecedent is unmistakable. It may be grammatically defensible, but if it suggests that a specific word (as opposed to a whole clause) is the antecedent of the relative pronoun, it will mislead the reader nonetheless.</p>
<p>It must therefore be used with great care. Barzun [pp. 77－78] warns that when "which" and "this" are used to refer "to antecedent ideas—sentences or statements taken as a whole—only the closest attention will prevent ambiguity or blunders."</p>
<p>In the example under consideration, the "which" is intended to refer to the entire preceding clause: "the Political Bureau... took decisive measures etc." But after the manner of relative pronouns, it fastens upon the nearest preceding noun instead, the "Gang of Four."Consequently, the only possible interpretation of the sentence is that Hua Guofeng and the other leaders played an important role in the Gang of Four. There is no "ambiguity" here, just an outright "blunder" of major proportions.</p>
<p>Unlike the sentence about the virtuous cow, this one cannot be fixed simply by moving the relative clause to another position. To break the unintended link between the pronoun "which" and the false antecedent, "the Gang of Four," we have to provide the pronoun with an appropriate and <u>nearby</u>
 antecedent:</p>
<p>-In October of the same year, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee took decisive measures to break up the Gang of Four, <i>an operation in which</i>
 he, Ye Jianying, Li Xiannian, and others played an important role.</p>
<p>In this revision the idea to which the pronoun was meant to refer—"the Political Bureau... took decisive measures etc."—has been summed up in a single word, "operation."And it is now that word, positioned directly before the "which" (the spot formerly occupied by "the Gang of Four"), that stands in the place where readers expect to find the antecedent.</p>
<p>3) Lastly, another example from Chinglish. Here again, the relative pronoun, intended to refer to an entire preceding statement, rejects that antecedent in favor of a closer word, with a result that sabotages the meaning.</p>
<p>- To enforce the people's democratic dictatorship, we must launch an unremitting struggle against <u>bureaucracy</u>
 , <u>which</u>
 is of great importance.</p>
<p>The "which" is meant to represent "we must launch an unremitting struggle etc."But it is attracted instead to the immediately preceding noun "bureaucracy."Thus, the sentence appears to be saying that bureaucracy is very important—the opposite of what the translator intended to convey. No doubt readers who are misled will quickly realize their mistake, but why should they be subjected to even momentary confusion?</p>
<p>As before, to rewrite the sentence so that it says without the slightest ambiguity what it is supposed to mean, we must break the link between the "which" and the false antecedent. In the "Gang of Four" example above, this was accomplished by supplying a proper antecedent and placing it close at hand.</p>
<p>That can be done here too, if we consider that what is important is not "to launch" the struggle but the "struggle" itself—a slightly different interpretation that means virtually the same thing:</p>
<p>- To enforce the people's democratic dictatorship, we must launch an unremitting struggle against bureaucracy, <i>a struggle which</i>
 is of great importance.</p>
<p>Another solution would be to discard the "which" and start over with a different construction. Here is one possibility:</p>
<p>- To enforce the people's democratic dictatorship, we must launch an unremitting struggle against bureaucracy. <i>It is very important to conduct such a struggle.</i>
</p>
<p>The last two examples confirm Professor Barzun's warning about the risks of using "which" to refer to an entire preceding idea. Whenever you come across such a construction in a text you are revising, you should ask yourself if the pronoun clearly refers to the idea in question.</p>
<p>If you find that the antecedent is vague, or that it is not immediately obvious, the possible solutions are the two demonstrated above. You can either (1) sum up the idea in a word or phrase that can serve as a specific and unmistakable antecedent for the "which," or (2) change the relative clause to another construction.</p>
<h3 id="c5">4. When pronouns do not agree with their antecedents</h3>
<p>To repeat: a pronoun "agrees" with its antecedent when it is in the same person, number, and gender as the word it represents. As we have seen, this agreement helps the reader recognize that pronoun and antecedent are simply two ways of referring to the same thing. Indeed, the agreement is essential. If the pronoun disagrees with its antecedent, readers have no way of identifying one with the other.</p>
<p>Chinese translators (or journalists writing directly in English) rarely make mistakes in the first and third categories, person and gender. For example, when the antecedent is "recent events" (third person), they are not likely to refer to them with the pronoun "you" (second person). And if the antecedent is "the report" (neuter), they will not refer to it as "he" (masculine).</p>
<p>When Chinese make a mistake in the agreement between pronoun and antecedent, it is almost always a question of number.</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Examples of disagreement in number</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>In the following sentences one of the two words is singular, the other plural:</p>
<p>- If <u>each enterprise</u>
 goes it alone, <u>they</u>
 will never be able to improve the quality of <u>their</u>
 products.</p>
<p>"Each enterprise" is singular, as shown by the singular verb "goes."The pronouns "they" and "their," however, are plural. Correction: “... <i>it</i>
 will never be able to improve the quality of <i>its</i>
 products."</p>
<p>- In the past decade we scored great achievements. <u>These</u>
 should be attributed to the efforts of the collective and not to me, though I played a part in <u>it</u>
 .</p>
<p>The antecedent "These" is plural, but the pronoun "it" is singular. Correction: “... though I played a part in <i>them.</i>
 "</p>
<p>In these examples, readers may overlook the errors and correctly guess the intended meaning. But sometimes disagreement between pronoun and antecedent can be quite misleading, as in the following sentence:</p>
<p>-The Carter <u>administration</u>
 committed itself to the withdrawal of American <u>troops</u>
 from Taiwan, but in the meantime <u>they</u>
 adopted the Taiwan Relations Act, which constituted interference in China's internal affairs.</p>
<p>The "Carter administration" is thought of as singular, as evidenced by the singular "itself," but the pronoun that represents the administration is the plural "they."This discrepancy prevents readers from recognizing at once that "administration" is the antecedent of "they" and, worse, leads them to assume for a moment that the antecedent is the American "troops," which are plural like the pronoun. Correction: “... but in the meantime, <i>it</i>
 adopted the Taiwan Relations Act."</p>
<h3 id="c6">Mistakes made by native speakers of English</h3>
<p>As Barzun suggests, pronouns cause almost as much trouble to native speakers of English as they do to persons who have learned it as a second language. It is not surprising, then, that native speakers make all the same mistakes that are found in Chinglish. They too use pronouns whose antecedents are missing, ambiguous, too far away, or in grammatical disagreement.</p>
<p>This last error is probably the most common. The following examples betray the writers' confusion as to whether a given antecedent is singular or plural:</p>
<p>-<i>From a letter from a U. S. health insurance company to a client:</i>
</p>
<p>At this time <u>Medicare</u>
 is updating <u>their</u>
 files and is requesting a copy of your Medicare Card.</p>
<p>[Medicare starts out singular (“<u>is</u>
 updating”), immediately afterward becomes plural (“<u>their</u>
 files”) and then reverts to singular (“<u>is</u>
 requesting”).]</p>
<p>-<i>From the description on the cover of a tape recording of the Bible in English:</i>

<p>Alexander Scourby's dramatic and moving <u>narration</u>
 of the Bible has touched and inspired millions—as <u>they</u>
 will you!</p>
<p>[Again the switch from singular (“<u>has</u>

 will”). Perhaps the writer was distracted by the intervening plural "millions."]</p>
<p>-<i>From the U. S. newsweekly</i>
 The Nation:</p>
<p>By muffling <u>its</u>
 own voice, the <u>media</u>
 limit <u>their</u>
 own usefulness.</p>
<p>[One group of writers holds that "media" is singular ("its"), while another insists that it is plural ("their"). Here it has been made first one, then the other—a compromise that surely neither party to the dispute would find acceptable.]</p>
<p>-<i>From an advertisement for tennis rackets, quoted by William Safire in the</i>
 New York Times:</p>
<p>

 who thinks a Yonex racquet has improved <u>their</u>
 game, please raise <u>your</u>
 hand.</p>
<p>[Here, the inconsistency as to number is compounded by inconsistency as to person. "Anyone" (third person, singular, as shown by "thinks") is referred to first by "their" (third person, plural), and then by "your" (second person, singular). Since the writer was no doubt a well educated professional, this spectacular disregard for agreement should probably be attributed not to an ignorance of English grammar but to an ill-advised attempt at "folksy" informality.]</p>

<u>Missing antecedent</u>

</p>
<p>1) A: I can give you some records made by Cheng Yanqiu. I enjoy his records very much. When I can't sleep well, I listen to them a while. In the old society <u>they</u>
 were looked down upon. Now we call them performing artists, and we are all on an equal footing.</p>
<p>B: I can give you some records made by Cheng Yanqiu. I enjoy his records very much. When I can't sleep, I listen to them for a while. In the old society <i>Peking opera performers</i>
 were looked down upon. Now we call them performing artists, and we are all on an equal footing.</p>
<p>[-In A-version the inescapable assumption is that "they," like the preceding "them," refers to "records."</p>
<p>-In B-version the logical subject is substituted for the pronoun: "Peking opera performers."]</p>
<p>2) A: When you [Chancellor Helmut Kohl of the then Federal Republic of Germany] visited China in 1974, you and I talked about the danger of war. Now <u>we</u>
 have slightly different views. We feel that although the danger of war still exists and we still have to remain vigilant, the factors that can prevent a new world war are growing.</p>
<p>B: When you visited China in 1974, you and I talked about the danger of war. Now <i>we Chinese</i>
 have slightly different views. We feel that although the danger of war still exists and we still have to remain vigilant, the factors that can prevent a new world war are growing.</p>
<p>[-The "we" in the second sentence of A-version is meant to represent the Chinese leaders, but they are never mentioned.</p>
<p>-Accordingly, the only possible way of understanding the "we" is that it refers to "you and I"—that is, to Chancellor Kohl and the speaker. This applies to the following "we" s as well.</p>
<p>-To prevent this blunder, the reviser specified "we Chinese."]</p>
<p>3) A: They [the people's governments at all levels] must direct the departments of justice, civil affairs, public security, and culture and education... to implement the [Marriage] law and combine <u>it</u>
 as much as possible with the central tasks of agrarian reform and the democratic consolidation of local governments.</p>
<p>B: They must direct the departments of justice, civil affairs, public security, and culture and education... to ensure that the law is enforced, combining <i>that task</i>
 as much as possible with the central tasks of agrarian reform and the democratic consolidation of local governments.</p>
<p>[-In A-version "it," having no true antecedent, attaches itself to the "law," which is immediately preceding and with which it agrees grammatically. As all but the least attentive readers will recognize by the end of the sentence, the difficulty is that one cannot combine a "law" with "tasks."</p>
<p>-In B-version "it" has been replaced with a sensible noun, "that task" (i. e., the task of implementing the law).</p>
<p>-("To implement the law" was changed to "to ensure that the law is enforced" for reasons of logic. The government departments named cannot themselves carry out the provisions of the Marriage Law; they can only ensure that the citizens do so. )]</p>
<p>4) A: In Africa too, the strong and common voice of the Organization of African Unity is to ask other countries not to interfere in <u>their</u>
 internal affairs.</p>
<p>B: The African <i>countries</i>
 too, through the Organization of African Unity, demand with one voice that no other country interfere in <i>their internal affairs.</i>
</p>
<p>[-The "their" in A-version refers to the closely preceding "other countries," which is in any event the only plural antecedent available. Thus "other countries" are being asked not to interfere in their own affairs, which is nonsense.</p>
<p>-In the revision "their" internal affairs is given its missing antecedent, the "African countries."</p>
<p>-"Other countries" (plural) was changed to "no other country" (singular) so that there would be no competing plural antecedent for "their."</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : The sense of "strong" in A-version was incorporated into the verb in B-version: "ask" became "demand," making it possible to eliminate the adjective. )]</p>
<p>5) A: The several million people we have provided for [demobilized KMT troops and former government personnel, shortly after Liberation] will play some useful role. It is our determination to make them productive. We are quite certain of <u>this</u>
 because this principle was implemented during the War of Resistance Against Japan.</p>
<p>B: The several million people we have provided for will play some useful role. We should be determined to turn them into a productive force. We are quite certain that <i>this can be done,</i>
 because the principle was applied successfully during the War of Resistance Against Japan.</p>
<p>[-In A-version "this" is afloat without a specific antecedent. There is no way for the reader to tell just what "we are certain" of. Strictly speaking, the pronoun refers to the preceding sentence and means "we are quite certain that we have this determination."Clearly, that is not the intended sense.</p>
<p>-The reviser judged from the Chinese passage as a whole that the meaning was: "We are quite certain that this can be done."That is what he put in the revision.]</p>
<p>6) A: Is it possible that a country like this will be brought down so easily? No, it is not. Neither people in China nor those in other countries, such as the superpowers and the rich countries, will be able to do <u>that</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: Is it possible that a country like this will be brought down so easily? No, it is not. Neither people in China nor those in other countries, such as the superpowers and the rich countries, have the ability to <i>bring China down.</i>
</p>
<p>[-A-version seems logical enough at first, but in fact its structure will not bear examination.</p>
<p>-The final pronoun (“will be able to do <u>that</u>
 ”) has nothing to refer to. If the reader, looking back to find an antecedent, asks: "none of these people will be able to do <u>what</u>
 ?" the only available answer is "be brought down," which makes no sense.</p>
<p>-The problem is that the intended antecedent is in passive voice—the wrong grammatical form. To serve as an antecedent for "do that" (or "do this" or "do so"), a verb has to be in active voice.</p>
<p>-Rather than rewrite the first sentence to provide a usable antecedent, the reviser discarded the pronoun. In B-version "to do that" was replaced with the phrase it was meant to represent, "to bring China down."]</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Ambiguous antecedent</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>7) A: Government departments, schools, factories and enterprises should fix the number of <u>their</u>
 workers and other employees and according to <u>their</u>
 specific work and production requirements set work loads for all of them.</p>
<p>B: Government departments, schools, factories and enterprises should fix the number of <i>their</i>
 employees and set work loads for all of them in accordance with <i>the units'</i>
 needs.</p>
<p>[-In A-version the first "their" plainly refers to the "government departments etc."The second "their" is meant to do the same, but because of the intervening "workers and other employees" it attaches itself to them instead. Since both antecedents seem to make sense, the reader does not know which is the correct one.</p>
<p>-In B-version the second "their" has been replaced by the noun it represents, "the units'," so that no misunderstanding is possible.</p>
<p>-(In this context there was no need to distinguish between "workers" and "other employees," so both were included in the general term "employees.")</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : There also seemed no need to distinguish between the "work" requirements of some units and the "production" requirements of others; indeed, in context, both words were unnecessary modifiers. "Specific" was likewise judged superfluous. Thus the A-version phrase "specific work and production requirements" was reduced to the single word "requirements," which was then changed to "needs.")]</p>
<p>8) A: Under such circumstances, the comrade presiding over the meeting should explain to <u>them</u>
 [members of Party branches] how to go about the work, pointing out that <u>they</u>
 should first talk to those workers and peasants who are usually enthusiastic about <u>their</u>
 work or who are willing to join the Red Army.</p>
<p>B: Under such circumstances, the comrade presiding over the meeting should explain to <i>them</i>
 how to go about the work. He should advise <i>them</i>
 to talk first to those workers and peasants who are usually enthusiastic about <i>the Party's</i>
 work or who are willing to join the Red Army.</p>
<p>[-In A-version all three pronouns are intended to have the same antecedent: the members of Party branches. "Their," however, attaches itself to "workers and peasants" instead.</p>
<p>-Readers inevitably understand that the workers and peasants are enthusiastic about their own work, and since that is not an unreasonable interpretation, they may never realize that they have been led astray.</p>
<p>-In the revision the pronoun has been replaced by an unambiguous noun: "the Party's work."</p>
<p>-(The sentence was broken into two so that readers would not have too many ideas to absorb all at once. )]</p>
<p>9) A: Here I must make it clear that new intellectual cadres have quite a few shortcomings. It is the duty of veteran cadres to help <u>them</u>
 overcome <u>their</u>
 weaknesses and lead <u>them</u>
 onto the correct path. Veterans should not be jealous of <u>their</u>
 knowledge and ability nor should <u>they</u>
 put on airs. <u>They</u>
 should learn from <u>them</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: Here I must make it clear that new intellectual cadres have quite a few shortcomings. It is the duty of veteran cadres to help <i>them</i>
 overcome <i>their</i>
 weaknesses and lead <i>them</i>
 onto the correct path. Veterans should not be jealous of <i>the new cadres'</i>
 knowledge and ability, and <i>they</i>
 should not put on airs because of <i>their</i>
 seniority. Rather, <i>they</i>
 should learn from <i>their new comrades.</i>
</p>
<p>[-In the A-version of these four sentences, there are no less than seven pronouns, all third person plural, sharing two different antecedents.</p>
<p>-The first three pronouns ("help them," "their weaknesses," "lead them") all plainly refer to the "new intellectual cadres."But after that, the reader enters upon the "dangerous wilderness" to which Professor Barzun refers.</p>
<p>-"Their" (in "their knowledge and ability") is powerfully drawn to the nearby "Veterans," which is the subject of the sentence, but actually it refers again to the new cadres.</p>
<p>-The next "they" ("they should not put on airs") now does mean the veterans, but could just as logically mean the new cadres.</p>
<p>-In the last sentence ("They should learn from them"), "they" again represents the veterans, while "them" represents the new cadres, although the reverse reading would be equally plausible.</p>
<p>-To straighten out this tangle, the polisher first replaced "<u>their</u>
 knowledge and ability" with "the new cadres' knowledge and ability."</p>
<p>-This left "<u>they</u>
 should not put on airs" plainly referring to the subject "Veterans," as did also "<u>They</u>
 should learn."</p>
<p>-Then she made the final "them" explicit by replacing the pronoun with "their new comrades."</p>
<p>-The net result of these changes was that starting with the third sentence, all the pronouns now had the same antecedent, "Veterans."</p>
<p>-The polisher could even introduce two more pronouns—“because of <u>their</u>
 seniority" (added to clarify the sense), and "<u>their</u>
 new comrades”—without causing readers to lose their way: the new pronouns had the same antecedent as the others.]</p>
<p>10) A: At this time, "Left" adventurism represented by Wang Ming was already dominant in the Provisional Central Committee. <u>It</u>
 failed to understand and deal with these questions correctly.</p>
<p>B: At this time, "Left" adventurism represented by Wang Ming was already dominant in the Provisional Central Committee. <i>The Committee</i>
 failed to understand and deal with these questions correctly.</p>
<p>[-In A-version the "It" at the head of the second sentence is meant to refer to the immediately preceding "Provisional Central Committee."But a noun that is the subject of a sentence exercises a strong attraction on a following pronoun.</p>
<p>-Thus, despite the proximity of the true antecedent, the reader thinks at first that "It" refers to the subject of the preceding sentence, "adventurism."</p>
<p>-To dispel this ambiguity, the polisher discarded the pronoun and substituted the noun it stood for, "the Committee."]</p>
<p>11) A: At last they [the Chinese people] have chosen their present political system and government. <u>It</u>
 was by their efforts that the Chinese revolution triumphed. <u>It</u>
 was certainly not imported from outside.</p>
<p>B: At last they have chosen their present political system and government. <i>It was thanks to their efforts that the Chinese revolution triumphed. The revolution</i>
 was certainly not imported from outside.</p>
<p>[-In A-version the first "it" is merely an idiomatic device for anticipating the subject of the sentence ("that the Chinese revolution triumphed"). Readers do not perceive it as a pronoun with an antecedent, any more than they would in the construction "<u>It</u>
 is true that the Chinese revolution triumphed."</p>
<p>-When readers come to the second "it"—standing, like the first, as subject at the head of the sentence—they automatically assume that it is performing the same function as the first. If only unconsciously, they expect parallel structure: "<u>It</u>
 was by their efforts that the revolution triumphed. <u>It</u>
 was certainly not (by the efforts of anyone else)."</p>
<p>-Only when they come to the end of the sentence do readers realize that the two "it" s are being used in two different senses.</p>
<p>-To prevent this momentary misunderstanding, the reviser simply replaced the second "it" by its antecedent, "the revolution."]</p>
<p>12) A: Currently the proportion of private industry and commerce in the economy is quite large. In industry the private sector accounts for 42 per cent and in retail trade for 68 per cent. Workers and shop assistants employed in private industry and commerce (excluding handicrafts and family-run shops) total roughly 3. 8 million, as against the 4. 2 million employed in state-owned factories and state commerce. <u>This</u>
 is a great asset to the state and still plays a large part in the national economy and the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>B: Currently the proportion of private industry and commerce in the economy is quite large. In industry the private sector accounts for 42 per cent and in retail trade for 68 per cent. Workers and shop assistants employed in private industry and commerce (excluding handicrafts and family-run shops) total roughly 3. 8 million, as against the 4. 2 million employed in state-owned factories and state commerce. <i>Private industry and commerce</i>
 are a great asset to the state and still play a large part in the national economy and the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>[-In A-version the translator has tried to make "This" sum up the entire content of three fact-laden sentences. That is too heavy a task for a demonstrative pronoun. At best, it can refer only to the immediately preceding sentence, suggesting that the high proportion of workers in private employ is a great asset to the state.</p>
<p>-Studying the passage, the polisher noted that the second and third sentences merely gave statistics to support the first. It was this opening statement that was the important one and, remote though it was, the true antecedent of "This."</p>
<p>-This understanding of the meaning made it possible for the polisher to provide the logical subject for the fourth sentence. Abandoning the "This" as unusable, he substituted "Private industry and commerce."]</p>
<p>13) A: If anyone sets out to make revolution but insists on demonstrating his talent in ways that harm the revolution, then we will say to him: Sorry, but we have to impose restraints on you. If this is not the case, no one would feel restrained in any way. We all acknowledge the talent of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and comrade Mao Zedong, and all of them are models of discipline. Therefore comrades need not have any worry about <u>that</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: If anyone sets out to make revolution but insists on demonstrating his abilities in ways that harm the revolution, then we have to say to him: Sorry, but we must impose restraints on you. If we didn't, no one would feel restrained in any way. We all acknowledge the abilities of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and comrade Mao Zedong, and all of them are models of discipline. So comrades need not worry <i>that discipline will inhibit their abilities.</i>
</p>
<p>[-The antecedent of "that" is vague at best. It appears to mean that comrades need not worry about how disciplined Marx and the others are... surely not what the speaker intended.</p>
<p>-Again the polisher studied the original in context to determine the true meaning of the passage. His conclusion was spelled out in B-version: "comrades need not worry that discipline will inhibit their abilities."</p>
<p>-(In the revision, "abilities" was used instead of "talent(s)” because "talent" most often has the sense of natural aptitude for the arts. Thus, one would not normally speak of a "talented" philosopher, economist, politician, administrator, or the like. )]</p>

</p>
<p>14) A: In admitting these <u>persons</u>
 into the Party, we must neither lower our requirements nor take in everyone who is qualified. The Party organizations should not only examine whether <u>they</u>
 are qualified politically, but should consider whether admission benefits <u>their</u>
 revolutionary activities.</p>
<p>B: In admitting these persons into the Party, we must neither lower our standards nor take in everyone who is qualified. The Party organizations should consider not only whether <i>a candidate</i>
 is qualified politically, but also whether admission will help <i>him</i>
 in <i>his</i>
 revolutionary activities.</p>
<p>[-In A-version the pronoun "they," which is intended to refer to the "persons" mentioned in the preceding sentence, is so far away from its antecedent that the reader does not readily make the connection between the two.</p>
<p>-Rather, the pronoun is attracted to the intervening "Party organizations," which are close at hand and also in the strong position of subject of the sentence.</p>
<p>-Both grammatically and logically, the pronoun "their" could refer either to the Party "organizations" or to the "persons" applying for membership. The reader has no way of knowing which is the intended antecedent.</p>
<p>-In B-version "they" has been replaced by "a candidate."That word matches the singular "everyone," and it leads to "him" and "his," singular pronouns that can only refer to the "candidate."</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : In A-version "consider" is essentially only a second reference to "examine," so the reviser tightened the sentence by dropping "examine.")]</p>
<p>15) A: That is the test of whether you are truly carrying out the <u>decisions</u>
 or just going through the motions, dragging your feet and perhaps even deliberately misinterpreting <u>them</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: That is the test of whether you are truly complying or just going through the motions, dragging your feet and perhaps even deliberately misinterpreting <i>decisions.</i>
</p>
<p>[-In A-version the inescapable reading is that you are misinterpreting your feet. The true antecedent of "them," "decisions," is too far away to be associated with the pronoun.</p>
<p>-In B-version "them" has been replaced by the noun it was intended to stand for, "decisions."</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : To avoid repeating "decisions," the reviser changed "carrying out decisions" to "complying," which did not require an object and, in this context, meant the same thing. )]</p>
<p>16) A: We should create an atmosphere in which everybody can discuss <u>questions</u>
 from a socialist standpoint, so that we can do a good job in literature and art and satisfactorily carry out the policy in this field. On <u>these</u>
 , we each have our own views, so why can't they be discussed?</p>
<p>B: We should create an atmosphere in which everybody can discuss <i>questions</i>
 from a socialist standpoint, so that we can do a good job in literature and art and satisfactorily carry out the policy in this field. We each have our own views on <i>these questions,</i>
 so why can't they be discussed?</p>
<p>[-In A-version the antecedent "questions" is so far back that readers have forgotten it by the time they reach the pronoun "these."The "these" seems to refer rather to the intervening "literature and art."</p>
<p>-In B-version the pronoun "these" was turned into an adjective modifying "questions," the noun to which the pronoun referred.]</p>
<p>17) A: The congress has, for the first time, made a systematic exposition of the basic guiding principle of the primary stage of socialism, <u>which</u>
 is of important immediate significance.</p>
<p>B: For the first time, the Congress has systematically set forth the basic guiding principles of the primary stage of socialism. <i>This statement (or:</i>
 explanation, <i>or:</i>
 clarification) is of immediate importance.</p>
<p>[-In A-version the antecedent of "which" is not clear. The relative pronoun is apparently meant to refer to the whole preceding idea—that the Congress has made a systematic exposition etc. But it is attracted to the specific nearby elements—both "the primary stage of socialism" and "the basic guiding principle."</p>
<p>-As in the preceding example, in B-version the pronoun was discarded and replaced with a noun plus adjective: "this statement."</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : "Of important immediate significance" was considered redundant and reduced to "of immediate importance.""Made a systematic exposition of"—an example of the unnecessary verb + noun construction—was replaced with a plain verb, "systematically set forth.")]</p>

<p>18) A: "<u>Every</u>
 top <u>official</u>
 should go and spend several days in a number of impoverished villages before <u>they</u>
 make decisions concerning poverty alleviation," said President Jiang Zemin.</p>
<p>B: "<i>All</i>
 top <i>officials</i>
 should go and spend several days in a number of impoverished villages before <i>they</i>
 make decisions concerning the alleviation of poverty," said President Jiang Zemin.</p>
<p>[-"Every" official is singular, as is clear from the singular form of the noun. (Cf. "each" official, "either" official, "any" official etc. ) It therefore cannot be referred to, as in A-version, with a plural pronoun, "they."</p>
<p>-In B-version the antecedent was made plural to agree with the pronoun.</p>
<p>-It would also have been possible to make the pronoun singular to agree with the antecedent. But then, to avoid the suggestion that "every top official" is necessarily a man, the polisher would have had to use the formula "he or she."As is often the case, it seemed less awkward to use the plural "they," which does not specify gender.</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : "Poverty alleviation" was changed to "the alleviation of poverty" to avoid using a noun ("poverty") as an adjective in an unfamiliar combination. )]</p>
<p>19) A: <u>Someone</u>
 is bound to make trouble, but we must not let <u>them</u>
 cause serious disturbances.</p>
<p>B: <i>Some people</i>
 are bound to make trouble, but we must not let <i>them</i>
 cause serious disturbances.</p>
<p>[-"Someone" is plainly singular since it takes the singular verb "is."(Cf. most other indefinite pronouns: "somebody" / "something" ; " everyone" /"everybody" /"everything" ; "anyone" /"anybody" /"anything" ; "no one" /"nobody" / "nothing" ; etc. )</p>
<p>-Accordingly, in A-version the plural pronoun "them" disagrees with its antecedent.</p>
<p>-In the revision the antecedent "Someone" was replaced by the plural "Some people" to match the plural pronoun.]</p>
<p>20) A: The national leadership of our country has been shifted to a new <u>generation</u>
 , and now <u>they</u>
 are dealing with state affairs.</p>
<p>B: The national leadership of our country has been shifted to <i>members</i>
 of a new generation, and it is now <i>they</i>
 who are dealing with state affairs.</p>
<p>[-In A-version the plural pronoun "they" refers to the singular antecedent "generation."</p>
<p>-In principle, the polisher could have corrected the agreement by replacing "they" with the singular pronoun "it."But she felt that "<u>it</u>
 has begun to deal with state affairs" would be clumsy at best.</p>
<p>-Logically too, "it" seemed wrong: it was not an entire generation that was taking over the leadership but only certain members of that generation.</p>
<p>-For these reasons, the polisher introduced "members" as a plural antecedent for the pronoun "they."In other words, instead of changing the pronoun to match the antecedent, she changed the antecedent to match the pronoun. (Remember that this alternative solution sometimes produces a smoother version. )</p>
<p>-("Now they are dealing with state affairs" was changed to "it is now they who are dealing with state affairs" to provide better emphasis in accordance with the meaning of the Chinese. )]</p>
