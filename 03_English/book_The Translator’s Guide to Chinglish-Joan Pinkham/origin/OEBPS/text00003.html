<h1>To the Reader</h1>
<p>This book can be used either in the classroom or for independent study. It is addressed primarily to Chinese translators and to advanced students of English who are practicing translation. I hope, however, that it will prove equally useful to other Chinese who are called upon to write English and who wish to improve their mastery of it—people working in journalism, foreign affairs, business, tourism, advertising, and many other fields.</p>
<p>Naturally, readers who open this book will have reached varying levels of skill in their second language. But to one degree or another, the work of all but the most highly trained and experienced among them will inevitably contain elements of Chinglish. Chinglish, of course, is that misshapen, hybrid language that is neither English nor Chinese but that might be described as "English with Chinese characteristics."</p>
<p>In writing this Guide, I have assumed that my Chinese readers have a basic knowledge of English grammar and that if they want a review of the subject, they can find it in other books. My purpose is rather to show translators—and, by extension, others who are writing directly in English—how to recognize elements of Chinglish in a first draft and how to revise it so as to eliminate those elements. In other words, this book is intended to help them turn their work into real English such as might have been written by an educated native speaker of the language.</p>
<p>At institutions like Xinhua News Agency, <i>China Daily,</i>
 Foreign Languages Press, and the Central Translation Bureau, this task is commonly entrusted to senior translators or editors or to foreign "polishers" (who may be more or less competent to perform it). But in principle, much of the work could be done by the original translators—or writers—themselves. That is why throughout these pages I have sometimes referred to the "translator," sometimes to the "polisher" or "reviser."The terms are not mutually exclusive: every translator rereading a first draft can and should be his or her own polisher.</p>
<p>The examples of Chinglish presented here (the "A-version" in each case) are authentic. That is, although some of them have been simplified for instructional purposes, none are invented. Most were found in draft translations that were corrected before the text appeared in print. Some were found in published materials—official documents, <i>China Daily,</i>
 the several English-language magazines, and so on. The source of an example is indicated only when it appeared in a foreign publication, such as the <i>Far Eastern Economic Review</i>
 or a U. S. newspaper.</p>
<p>When an example of Chinglish is taken from a draft translation, the revision offered here (the "B-version”) is, with few exceptions, the one decided upon by the polishers who revised it. If, however, the A-version appeared in print, the revision is one that I think should have been made and that I am suggesting now. In either case, the proposed B-version is not necessarily the only "correct" one. Translation is not a science but a craft, and craftsmen in any field may have different opinions as to the best solution to a given technical problem.</p>
<p>It may seem presumptuous for a person who knows little of the Chinese language to proffer a work of this kind. My qualifications are that I am a lifelong student of English and a professional translator (from French to English) who has given much thought to problems of translation. In addition, during the 1980s and 1990s I spent eight years working as a polisher in Beijing, first at Foreign Languages Press and later at the Central Translation Bureau (Bureau for the Compilation and Translation of Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin). During those years I had the opportunity to work closely with a wide range of Chinese translators, from beginners fresh out of school to the most capable senior professors. I learned much from them all.</p>
<p>Even with this background, however, I could not have produced this Guide without the help of two invaluable consultants who have kindly read and reread my manuscript. The first is my good friend Jiang Guihua, the retired chief of the English section at the Central Translation Bureau, who has examined every example with the critical eye of a skilled reviser. The second is my husband Larry, who has given me the benefit of his expertise as a writer and as a professor of journalism who has had long experience both teaching and polishing in China. The criticism and advice of these two knowledgeable editors, one native speaker of each language, have been, quite simply, indispensable.</p>

<p>致读者</p>
<p>本书可用于课堂教学，也可用于自学。其主要对象是中国的翻译工作者以及做翻译练习的高年级英语学生。但是，我希望这本书对需要用英语写作的其他中国人(包括新闻工作者、外事工作者、从事商业、旅游业、广告业以及许多其他行业需要使用英语的工作者)同样有帮助，而他们又都希望解够更好地掌握英语。</p>
<p>自然，当读者翻阅这本书时，他们使用第二语言的技能所达到的水平是不同的。但是，除了那些造诣很深的，一般人的翻译中都会不同程度地含有中式英语的成分。当然，所谓中式英语就是那种畸形的、混合的、既非英语又非汉语的语言文字，也可称其为“具有汉语特色的英语” 。</p>
<p>在写这本书的过程中，我心目中的中国读者已经掌握了基本的英语语法；如果有人想复习一下他们的语法，可以去求助于有关这方面的书籍。而我的目的则在于帮助翻译工作者以及其他直接用英语写作的人懂得如何在初稿中找出中式英语的成分并将其修改掉。也就是说，这本书是为了帮助他们将自己的写作修改成为地道的英语，就像一个受过教育的以英语为母语的人写的一样。</p>
<p>在一些像新华社、《中国日报》社、外文出版社、中央编译局的单位里，这项工作一般是由高级翻译、审校或外国专家做的(他们或多或少能够胜任这项任务)。但是，原则上，大部分工作可由译者(或作者)自己来完成。为此，在整部书中，我有时用“译者” ，有时用“润色者” 或“改稿人” 。这些词并不相互排斥：每位译者在审阅其初稿时都可以而且应当是他自己的润色者。</p>
<p>书中所提供的中式英语的例句(每一条初译文：A-version)都是有根据的。虽然其中有的例句为了便于说明而简化了，但都不是编造出来的。绝大部分例句是从初译稿中搜集的，出书之前都作了修正。有些是从出版物中找到的，如：正式文件、《中国日报》、几种英语杂志等等。给出处的例句都是引自外国出版物，如：《远东经济评论》或某份美国报纸。</p>
<p>书中凡是为从初译稿里引用的例句提供的修改译文(B-version)，除个别例外，都是由改稿人定的。但是，如果A-version是从已出版的书中引用的，那么所提供的修改译文则是我认为当初应该改而未改、现在建议这样改的。无论是哪一种情况，这里所提供的修改译文不一定是惟一“正确” 的。翻译不是一门科学，而是一种需要特殊技能的专业。每个行业的技术工人对于解决某个技术问题的最佳办法都会有不同的见解。</p>
<p>对于一个不懂汉语的人来说，向读者提供这样一部作品似乎有些不自量力。而我所具备的条件是：我一生都在学习英语而且是一名职业翻译(法译英)，因此，对翻译问题考虑甚多。在80年代到90年代期间，我在北京做了八年的修改译文工作。先是在外文出版社，后来在中央编译局(马恩列斯著作编译局)。在这些年里，我有机会同许多中国的翻译工作者密切合作，他们中间有刚走出校门的新手，也有水平很高的教授。我从他们那里都学到不少东西。</p>
<p>尽管如此，如果没有两位不可多得的人一遍又一遍地帮我审阅我的手稿，这本书是不可能写出来的。首先是我的好朋友姜桂华，她退休前任中央编译局英文处处长，她以一名有水平的改稿者身份严格地检查了每一个例句。其次是我先生拉里，他是一名作家和新闻学教授，曾多年在中国任教并从事修改译文工作，他的专长使我受益非浅。这两位有知识的审校人，一位的母语是英语，一位的母语是汉语，他们提出的批评和建议很简单，但却是不可或缺的。</p>
