<title>XII. Logical Connectives</title>
</head>
<body style="font-family:cnepub,serif;">
<h2>XII. Logical Connectives</h2>
<p>In the last four chapters we have been dealing with different aspects of a single, fundamental requirement of English prose: the need for logical connections between ideas.</p>
<p>The kinds of revision we have been studying—matching a pronoun to its antecedent, putting an emphasized point at the end of a sentence so that it leads into the next, correcting a misplaced or dangling modifier, introducing parallel structure—all these are simply means of ensuring clear and rational connections between the elements of a sentence or between successive sentences.</p>
<p>There is one additional means of achieving logical coherence that we should now consider. This means cannot replace the others, but it is called into play more often than any of them. It is the use of words and phrases such as these:</p>
<p>-"also" and "in addition"</p>
<p>-"but" and "on the contrary"</p>
<p>-"because" and "as a consequence"</p>
<p>-"meanwhile" and "at that time"</p>
<p>Expressions of this kind show the reader how two adjacent ideas are related, smoothing the transition from one to the next. In other words, they indicate the direction the writer's thought is about to take, making it easy for the reader to follow.</p>
<p>Chinese translators working into English do not always use these expressions correctly. The reason is simple: the equivalent characters are often lacking in the original. More than once in these pages we have noted that the Chinese language freely omits some elements that in English are considered essential. Chinese readers understand a text without these clues, but native speakers of English need and expect more help from the writer. For them, as we have seen, the translator must make explicit certain terms that in the original are only implied.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this more important than in the domain of logical connectives. Most often, when relations between ideas have only to be suggested in Chinese, they must be plainly stated in English. Barzun and Graff make the point succinctly when they advise writers [p. 261] that "to be heard and heeded you must do more than lay your ideas side by side... you must <i>articulate</i>
 them."</p>
<p>The many words and phrases that serve to "articulate" ideas—that is, to join them together in a meaningful way—include some of the shortest and simplest in English: "and," "but," "if," "also," "too," "since," "then," and so on. But their frequent appearance in any piece of prose demonstrates that, like the modest but indispensable prepositions, they are among the most valuable words in the language.</p>
<p>In this chapter we shall examine some of these words and phrases that translators need to provide. They offer one of the principal means of achieving continuity, coherence, and clarity in writing of any kind. They are the glue that holds English discourse together. Without them, an otherwise well constructed sentence or series of sentences will appear to the reader as no more than "a plate of loose sand."</p>
<h3 id="c1">Examples of logical connectives</h3>
<p>The conjunctions that link clauses grammatically are also the primary means of linking them logically. "And," "but," "because," "after," "although," "until," "so that," and the others, both coordinating and subordinating, are our keys to meaning.</p>
<p>Almost any sentence that is composed of more than a single independent clause requires a conjunction to make a grammatical connection between the two clauses and, at the same time, to express the logical relation between them. Two examples will suffice:</p>
<p>-Forty-two thousand refugees will be short of food in the coming months, <u>and</u>
 3, 000 houses need to be restored.</p>
<p>(Grammatical connection: two independent clauses, joined by coordinating conjunction. Logical relation: second statement gives additional information related to the first. )</p>
<p>-<u>Since</u>
 most of Hunan's coal mines are located in remote, hilly land, the province has encouraged laid-off workers there to switch to agriculture to earn a living.</p>
<p>(Grammatical connection: dependent clause + independent clause, joined by subordinating conjunction. Logical relation: second statement is a consequence of the first. )</p>
<p>Although two sentences are by definition separate structures that are not connected grammatically, they still need to be connected logically. Sometimes the logical relation is self-evident, but often a word is needed to make it explicit. In that case, a coordinating conjunction may serve the purpose. "But," for example, can make a logical connection not only between two independent clauses in the same sentence but also between two sentences:</p>
<p>-Luo's art is based on traditional techniques, <u>but</u>
 he does not allow himself to be restricted by tradition.</p>
<p>-Luo's art is based on traditional techniques. <u>But</u>
 he does not allow himself to be restricted by tradition.</p>
<p>More often, however, the logical link between two sentences is provided not by a conjunction but by an adverb. The function of adverbs, as you know, is simply to modify a verb, an adjective, another adverb, or sometimes a sentence as a whole.</p>
<p>Unlike conjunctions, such adverbs as "therefore," "however," "consequently," "nevertheless," "besides," and so on contribute nothing to the grammatical structure of a sentence. But like conjunctions, they contribute a great deal to its meaning. They show how the thought or action expressed in a given sentence is related to the thought or action in the preceding one.</p>
<p>They do this with admirable precision and economy. William Zinsser remarks, for example [p. 114], that in the sentence, "<u>Nevertheless</u>
 he decided to go," a single word "can replace a whole long phrase that summarizes what the reader has just been told: '<i>Despite the fact that all these dangers had been pointed out to him,</i>
 he decided to go. '"</p>
<p>Zinsser goes on to cite other short adverbs that are equally efficient at conveying complex meaning: “‘<u>Instead</u>
 I took the train. ' '<u>Still</u>
 I had to admire him. ' '<u>Thus</u>
 I learned how to smoke. ' 'It was <u>therefore</u>
 easy to meet him. ' '<u>Meanwhile</u>
 I had talked to John. '" And he gratefully concludes, "What a vast amount of huffing and puffing these pivotal words save!"</p>
<p>Examples of these "pivotal" adverbs can be found on any page, linking the meanings of sentences and sometimes of independent clauses. Here are two examples from Chinese publications:</p>
<p>-In New China, men and women—especially women, who suffered most from feudal oppression—have gained freedom of marriage and equal rights. <u>Thus</u>
 , in our new society they are taking a greater part in all kinds of political activities and in all fields of construction.</p>
<p>-We should not be dissuaded by the minor difficulties this will cause; <u>otherwise</u>
 , we shall have major difficulties that will affect the national economy and the people's well-being.</p>
<p>A large number of adverbial phrases, though a little longer than single adverbs, are no less useful indicators of logical connections. "In reality," "at the same time," "for instance," "in other words," "in the first place," "in the same way," "to summarize," "for this reason"—these and many more perform the same function. Here, for example, are two of them in action, bridging the gap between ideas.</p>
<p>-According to local statistics, the province now has green areas averaging 3. 2 square meters per person. <u>In addition</u>
 , there are 29 scenic spots and nature reserves, covering a total area of 3, 088 square kilometers.</p>
<p>-The Shanghai Housing Reform Office has granted 47 million yuan ($872 million) to more than 300 enterprises and work units for housing construction. <u>As a result</u>
 , a total of 7, 644 families who previously had a per capita floor space of less than 2. 5 square meters moved into new houses last year.</p>
<p>It should be noted that just because they are so useful, these ready-made connectives can be overworked. Jacques Barzun, for one, warns against excessive reliance on them and recommends that they be reduced to a minimum. "Ideally," he says [p. 165] "the perfect composition would consist of sentences so formed that the transition to the next would occur, without a word, in the reader's mind."</p>
<p>This is shrewd advice, and to the extent that writers of English have the skill to compose such sentences, we should all try to follow it. But Chinese translators run less risk of sprinkling a text with too many "however" s and "moreover" s than of failing to insert enough of them to provide coherence.</p>
<p>In the following sections we shall look first at various types of connectives and then at some passages in translations where they are missing but should have been supplied.</p>
<h3 id="c2">Types of logical connectives</h3>
<p>The countless words and phrases that link ideas can be classified according to the different relations they express. Following are some of those relations with a few examples of each category:</p>
<p>-<u>addition or amplification</u>
 : and, moreover, in addition</p>
<p>-<u>contrast or opposition</u>
 : but, on the contrary, instead</p>
<p>-<u>cause or effect</u>
 : because, thus, hence</p>
<p>-<u>similarity</u>
 : likewise, similarly, in the same way</p>
<p>-<u>purpose:</u>
 in order that, to this end, for this purpose</p>
<p>-<u>time sequence</u>
 : after, then, meanwhile</p>
<p>-<u>logical sequence</u>
 : in the first place, next, finally</p>
<p>-<u>illustration</u>
 : for instance, as an example, specifically</p>
<p>-<u>concession</u>
 : granted, to be sure, of course</p>
<p>-<u>intensification</u>
 : indeed, in fact, surely</p>
<p>-<u>restatement</u>
 : that is, in other words, as has been said</p>
<p>-<u>conclusion</u>
 : to sum up, in short, in conclusion</p>
<p>There is little to be said about any of these expressions beyond recommending that translators be alert to the need for them. To establish the principle of when and why they are required, we have only to consider some examples of the first three types listed, which are among the most useful. It is the connectives that express these relations that are most likely to be missing from translations where they are wanted.</p>
<h3 id="c3">Examples of missing links</h3>
<p>1. <i>
<u>Addition or amplification</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>The simplest and doubtless the most common sequence of ideas in expository prose is one in which a statement is followed by another statement that adds something to the first. The second statement will offer more information on the subject, supporting evidence for the argument, further development of the idea, the next event in the narrative, or the like.</p>
<p>Although this simple relation of addition or amplification can often be taken for granted, a connecting word—"and," "also," "too," "moreover," "besides," "furthermore," etc.—may be required to express it.</p>
<p>Consider this passage from the draft translation of an account of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression:</p>
<p>-As for the Chinese, in the stage of strategic defensive, the Kuomintang troops staged one retreat after another in front-line battlefields. Although the people's anti-Japanese forces had expanded, they were far from being able to carry out a strategic counter-offensive; before they were ready to do that they would still have a long, hard struggle to go through.</p>
<p>These two sentences together tell readers that at this stage of the war the Chinese position as a whole was weak. The first states that the KMT forces were continually retreating, the second that the revolutionary forces were not yet ready to mount an offensive. The second sentence adds information that reinforces the first, and readers should be made aware of that before they come to it. A simple "and" will serve the purpose:</p>
<p>-As for the Chinese, in the stage of strategic defensive, the Kuomintang troops had retreated time after time from front-line battlefields. <i>And</i>
 although the people's anti-Japanese forces had expanded, they were far from being able to carry out a strategic counter-offensive; before they were ready to do that they would still have a long, hard struggle to go through.</p>
<p>[<u>Review</u>
 : In the first sentence, "staged one retreat after another" was changed to "retreated time after time."This revision substituted a plain verb ("retreat") for an unnec. verb + noun construction ("stage a retreat"). It also eliminated the rhyming sound of "stage" /"staged," which immediately calls attention to itself and suggests that the two words are somehow related in meaning, when in fact they are not.]</p>
<p>In the revision "and," which usually serves to connect two words, phrases, or clauses, is used to connect two sentences. Although it was long considered impermissible to begin a sentence with "and" (or "but"), that notion is now discredited. Barzun expresses the consensus when he says [p. 159] that while both words "have suffered from ignorant prohibition... it is plain from American and English literature that the most exacting writers use them without hesitation as normal openers."</p>
<p>Here is another passage from the same text, this time from a paragraph describing the weaknesses of the KMT:</p>
<p>-As a result of successive defeats, it lost large numbers of men, and morale continued to sink. The mood among the officers and men was defeatist and war-weary. The people in the KMT areas rose up in struggle, making the KMT army's rear area insecure.</p>
<p>The first sentence tells readers of the KMT's loss of men and its deteriorating morale. The second sentence is so clearly an extension of the first that the two might as well be joined into one. The third sentence cites yet another, perhaps more important factor hastening the KMT army's disintegration. It amplifies what readers have just been told, and they should be given a signal of that in advance.</p>
<p>These considerations led to the following revision:</p>
<p>-As a result of successive defeats, it had lost large numbers of men, and morale continued to sink: the mood among the officers and men was defeatist and war-weary. <i>Moreover (or, stronger:</i>
 What is more), the people in the KMT areas rose up in struggle, making the KMT army's rear insecure.</p>
<p>Minor changes thus turned three choppy, disjointed sentences into a smooth, coherent whole.</p>
<p>2. <i>
<u>Contrast or opposition</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>Another common sequence of ideas is one in which the second opposes or qualifies the first. The content of the two successive clauses or sentences is not cumulative but contradictory.</p>
<p>There are a great many words and phrases that can express this relation: "but," "yet," "although," "however," "nevertheless," "on the other hand," "in spite of," and so on.</p>
<p>It is more important to use these, where appropriate, than it is to use words expressing addition or amplification. Although the lack of an "and" or a "furthermore" may make sentences seem jerky and disconnected, readers will still be able to follow the writer's line of thought. But if there is no "but" or "on the contrary" to signal that the writer is changing direction, readers will be misled, at least until they are well into the second sentence.</p>
<p>Zinsser [p. 114] makes this point very strongly. "I can't overstate," he says, "how much easier it is for readers to process a sentence if you start with 'but' when you're shifting direction, or, conversely, how much harder it is if they must wait until the end to realize that you're now in a different gear."</p>
<p>The following passage illustrates the pertinence of that remark:</p>
<p>-During the next six months, because the British side stuck to its position on the question of sovereignty over Hong Kong, there was no progress in the negotiations. In March 1983 Mrs. Thatcher wrote to the Chinese Premier promising that at a certain stage she would propose to the British Parliament that sovereignty over all of Hong Kong be returned to China.</p>
<p>The first sentence states that negotiations were stalemated because the British were intransigent. With nothing to indicate the contrary, readers assume that the next sentence will support the first. On learning that Prime Minister Thatcher wrote to Premier Zhao, they automatically expect to be told that her letter expressed a continuing refusal to compromise, and they proceed almost to the very end of the sentence with that understanding in mind. It is only when they reach the crucial words "be returned to China" that they realize they were mistaken.</p>
<p>The addition of a single word was all that was needed to prevent this misunderstanding. In the revision readers were given notice early on in the second sentence that the content of the letter, when they came to it, would represent a change in the British position:</p>
<p>-During the next six months, because the British side stuck to its position on the question of sovereignty over Hong Kong, there was no progress in the negotiations. In March 1983, <i>however,</i>
 Mrs. Thatcher wrote to the Chinese Premier promising that at a certain stage she would propose to the British Parliament that sovereignty over all of Hong Kong be returned to China.</p>
<p>The "however" could also have been put at the beginning of the sentence, but many advisers on writing think that in that position it is too obtrusive. Unless the word is to be given special emphasis, it is probably best to place it as in this revision, not at the very beginning but near it, between commas.</p>
<p>Here is another example of contrasting ideas that lack a connecting link:</p>
<p>-I am a layman in natural science. As my trip to Shanghai coincides with your discussion of a ten-year plan for science, I'd like to avail myself of this opportunity to touch on a few questions.</p>
<p>Here again, the first sentence leads readers to anticipate something different from what follows. Logically, if a person begins by saying he is a layman, one expects his next remark to be that he hesitates to address this conference of learned scientists, or perhaps that he hopes to listen and learn—at any rate, something consistent with his preliminary admission that he has no special knowledge of the subject under discussion. Instead, he says something contradictory: that he wants to talk about it. Readers have the uncomfortable sense that somewhere they missed a turn in the road.</p>
<p>They missed the turn because the translator failed to post a sign informing them that the second idea would stand in opposition to the first. Again, all it would have taken to set them on the right path was a single word:</p>
<p>-I am a layman in natural science. <i>But</i>
 as my trip to Shanghai coincides with your discussion of a ten-year plan for science, I'd like to avail myself of this opportunity to touch on a few questions.</p>
<p>3. <i>
<u>Cause or effect</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>This type of connective includes such expressions as "because," "since," "so that," "as a result," "for this reason," "therefore," "accordingly," etc. They are needed when one clause or sentence shows the consequence of another.</p>
<p>These connectives are even more essential to readers' understanding than are those that express contrast. So fundamental is the concept of cause and effect that if readers fail to perceive that relation where the writer intended it, they will miss a crucial element of meaning.</p>
<p>Here is a simple example from a draft translation:</p>
<p>-Private schools are in difficulty now because they can no longer rely on warlords and bureaucrat-capitalists for financial resources as they used to. Their school farmland was distributed to peasants during the agrarian reform. The government should show concern for these difficulties.</p>
<p>In this passage three ideas are simply "laid side by side" without "articulation," as three independent and seemingly unrelated statements. The first sentence tells readers that the private schools are in trouble because their source of funds has dried up. The second sentence states that they have lost their farmland, but the loss is not identified as another reason for their difficulties. The third sentence does indeed seem to follow from the first (the schools are in difficulty, and the government should show concern), but the intervening sentence destroys the connection.</p>
<p>The polisher decided the way to pull all these ideas together was to provide the missing link between the first sentence and the second—the relation of cause and effect:</p>
<p>-Private schools are having difficulties now, because they can no longer rely on warlords and bureaucrat-capitalists for financial support, <i>and because</i>
 their farmland was distributed to peasants during the agrarian reform. The government should concern itself with these difficulties.</p>
<p>[<u>Review</u>
 : In the first sentence "in difficulty" was changed to "having difficulties" to provide an antecedent for "these difficulties" in the last sentence.]</p>
<p>Once the first two sentences were logically related, the third flowed from them as a natural conclusion.</p>
<p>In the following example from another draft translation, the two sentences are longer and more complex than in the preceding one, but the need for a logical connective between them is no less plain:</p>
<p>-However, the Party had not had time for the entire membership to make a systematic review of its historical experience and, in particular, it had not thoroughly analyzed the kinds of thinking that were at the root of the "Left" and Right mistakes of the past. There were still differences of opinion with regard to the Party's guiding ideology, and these continued to be damaging to the revolutionary cause at certain times and places and in certain respects.</p>
<p>The author, it seemed clear, was making the point that because the Party had not thoroughly analyzed the mistaken thinking of the past, there were still damaging ideological differences at this time. But as in the preceding example, the cause-and-effect relation was only implied.</p>
<p>The polisher made it explicit:</p>
<p>-However, the Party had not had time for the entire membership to make a systematic review of its historical experience and, in particular, it had not thoroughly analyzed the kinds of thinking that were at the root of the "Left" and Right mistakes of the past. <i>Accordingly (or:</i>
 thus, <i>or:</i>
 as a result), there were still differences of opinion with regard to the Party's guiding ideology, and these continued to be damaging to the revolutionary cause at certain times and places and in certain respects.</p>
<h3 id="c4">Dubious logical connectives</h3>
<p>There are two frequently used connectives that merit particular attention because they are often vague or ambiguous. They are "while" and "with."</p>
<p>1. <i>
<u>While</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>The subordinating conjunction "while" is a slippery word that can be used in several senses, some of which are more acceptable than others. Its primary meaning is "at the same time as" :</p>
<p>-<u>While</u>
 Mother read the letter aloud, the family listened in silence. ("While" = "during the time that.")</p>
<p>Most language critics recommend that the word be restricted to this use, linking two simultaneous events.</p>
<p>Still, there is widespread, if sometimes grudging, acceptance of "while" used to represent a contrast without any reference to time, in the sense of either "although" or "whereas" :</p>
<p>-<u>While</u>
 everyone was astonished by the news, no one said a word until she had finished. ("While" = "although.")</p>
<p>-Not all the listeners had the same reaction. The children were delighted at the prospect of meeting their Taiwan cousins at last, <u>while</u>
 Grandfather maintained a frosty reserve. ("While" = "whereas" = "but, by contrast.")</p>
<p>What all authorities agree on is that "while" should not be used merely as an elegant substitute for a plain "and" :</p>
<p>-As he turned the pages of the album, Grandfather took a keen interest in the photographs of his brother and sister-in-law, <u>while</u>
 the whole family eagerly examined the pictures of Taipei. ("While" = "and," which should replace it. )</p>
<p>It is also generally agreed that "while" should not be used for "although" or "whereas" if its meaning is ambiguous—that is, if the reader cannot tell immediately in what sense the word is to be understood:</p>
<p>-The visitors were offered tea in the courtyard, <u>while</u>
 dinner was served indoors. ("While" = "whereas" ? or "at the same time as" ?)</p>
<p>Leaving this little family drama, we can now turn to two examples of "while" that have appeared in the work of Chinese translators.</p>
<p>Here is one that conforms to the generally approved usage—"while" has its original meaning of "at the same time" :</p>
<p>-When the congress opened, the leaders of the Communist Party organization in Guangdong were in favor of attacking the Right wing of the Kuomintang, isolating the middle-of-the-roaders and expanding the Left wing, <u>while</u>
 preparing to repel Chiang's attack.</p>
<p>Here is another in which "while" is ambiguous:</p>
<p>-As all of us lack experience in diplomacy, we should carry forward democracy. Three cobblers with their wits combined equal Zhuge Liang, the mastermind. <u>While</u>
 soliciting everybody's opinion, we should stress centralism. Efforts must be made to make democracy prevail in our embassies. Stress only on centralism without democracy will lead to bureaucracy. Advocating democracy can help us get rid of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Does "while" here mean "at the same time" (= while we are asking their opinions we should talk to them about the importance of centralism)? Or does it mean "although" (= although we should ask their opinions, we should remember that centralism is primary)?</p>
<p>And what is the logical connection between the last three sentences, all of which express the importance of democracy, and this one saying "we should stress centralism," which they seem to contradict? Just what point is the speaker trying to make?</p>
<p>Since no reader should have to struggle with such questions, the polishers tried to prevent them from arising:</p>
<p>-Since none of us is experienced in diplomacy, we should cultivate democracy. As the old saying goes, "Three cobblers with their wits combined match Zhuge Liang, the mastermind."<i>Of course, while</i>
 it is necessary to solicit everybody's opinion, we should stress centralism. <i>But</i>
 we must establish democracy in our embassies. Stressing centralism to the neglect of democracy will lead to bureaucratism, <i>while</i>
 promoting democracy can help us get rid of it.</p>
<p>Now it was clear that the first "while" was being used in the sense of "although."Also, that the following sentences were a return to the main point presented at the beginning (the need for democracy), the intervening remark ("we should stress centralism") being only parenthetical. The second "while" plainly meant "whereas."</p>
<p>But, you might argue, if "while" used in the sense of "although" or "whereas" can be ambiguous and requires such care, why not just put one of those words and be done with it? In the revision, the first "while" could easily be replaced with "although" and the second with "whereas."Wouldn't that be simpler and perhaps clearer as well? Your argument would have merit, and it would be applauded by all those who recommend that "while" be reserved for expressing time relations.</p>
<p>2. <i>
<u>With</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>Unlike all the words we have considered so far in this chapter, "with" is a preposition. But it is so often used as a logical connective—and so often in a vague or confusing manner—that it is worth considering alongside the conjunctions, adverbs and adverbial phrases that usually serve to tie ideas together.</p>
<p>A moment's reflection will show that "with" can be used in a great variety of senses. The following are only a few of the relations that this versatile word can express:</p>
<p>-<u>accompaniment</u>
 : he went with the children to see their teacher</p>
<p>-<u>agency</u>
 : with a nail and some twine she was able to repair the latch</p>
<p>-<u>characterization</u>
 : the girl with most courage spoke up first</p>
<p>-<u>manner</u>
 : with dogged persistence, they trudged on through the snow</p>
<p>-<u>possession</u>
 : the man with the key is not here</p>
<p>These and many other uses of "with" are entirely legitimate: in each example the connection made is clear and specific.</p>
<p>The difficulty arises when "with" is used in such a vague sense that it gives no precise indication of the relation between the two elements it joins.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>-<u>With</u>
 the rapid increase of automobile production and import starting from the early 1980s, Chen was promoted as the director of the newly formed Automotive Office in the Ministry.</p>
<p>The connection between the two events is foggy at best. The "with" suggests that Chen was promoted <u>because of</u>
 the increase in the number of automobiles. But that is by no means clear, and in any event it is not logical: someone else might have been appointed just as well, for the same reason.</p>
<p>The polisher decided that the true connection was simply one of timing. She therefore substituted for "with" a conjunction that would make that plain:</p>
<p>-<i>When</i>
 the production and import of automobiles began to increase rapidly in the early 1980s, Chen was promoted to the post of director of the newly formed Automotive Office in the Ministry.</p>
<p>Another example:</p>
<p>-<u>With</u>
 professionals familiar with the country's laws and proficient at foreign languages, these offices will save the time and energy of foreign trademark registrants.</p>
<p>Again "with" is too vague and general to express the relation between the two elements it is asked to connect. The professionals may be familiar "with" the laws, but what does it mean to say that the offices are "with" professionals?</p>
<p>It was not hard for the polisher to find a specific replacement:</p>
<p>-<i>Staffed by</i>
 professionals familiar with the country's laws and proficient at foreign languages, these offices will save time and energy for registrants of foreign trademarks.</p>
<p>One last example:</p>
<p>-<u>With</u>
 wide streets and a small population, the city is filled with gas stations and karaoke bars.</p>
<p>Here the difficulty is not that the relation between the ideas is vague but that it is non-existent. There is no logical reason why a city with wide streets and a small population should have many gas stations or karaoke bars. The writer has simply used "with" as a means of tacking onto his or her main clause some additional information about the city.</p>
<p>We can make the faulty logic a little less evident by consigning the irrelevant information to a subordinate clause:</p>
<p>-The city, <i>which has wide streets and a small population,</i>
 is filled with gas stations and karaoke bars.</p>
<p>Or, we could arrange the elements in two independent clauses, as a coordinate series of unrelated details:</p>
<p>-The city has wide streets and a small population, <i>and</i>
 it is filled with gas stations and karaoke bars.</p>
<p>Two separate sentences might be even better:</p>
<p>-The city has wide streets and a small population. It is filled with gas stations and karaoke bars, and...</p>
<p>The several revisions we have just cited represent the two ways for polishers to deal with a sentence that hinges on an inadequate "with."You can either:</p>
<p>-substitute another, more precise expression that clarifies the logical relation between the two terms in question (“<u>when</u>
 the production of automobiles," "<u>staffed by</u>
 professionals”)</p>
<p>or, if there is no logical relation to be expressed:</p>
<p>-abandon the attempt to make an arbitrary connection and content yourself with two independent statements.</p>
<p>To conclude this discussion of dubious connectives, we need only refer to the list of "Fifty Forbidden Words" that Barzun and Graff [p. 255] suggest the "self-critical writer" will want to deny himself. Under the heading "Feeble Connectives," their list includes "while (apart from time relations)” and "with (as a universal joint)."</p>
<h3 id="c5">Wrong logical connectives</h3>
<p>Sometimes a translator recognizes the need for a connective in English but supplies the wrong one. The commonest mistake of this kind is to put an "and" or an "also" where logic requires a "but" or a "however."Here is an example from a draft translation:</p>
<p>-In our system the public sector is the major sector of the economy <u>and</u>
 there are also other sectors.</p>
<p>The second statement does not support the first but, rather, reduces its force. The sense is: yes, it's true that in our system the public sector is the major sector of the economy, but it is not the only one. The word needed to express the connection between the two ideas is not an "and" but a "but," and the reviser changed it accordingly:</p>
<p>-In our system the public sector is the major sector of the economy, <i>but</i>
 there are also others.</p>
<p>Here is another example, this time one that appeared in print in a Chinese English-language publication:</p>
<p>-Efforts will be made to introduce pensions, medical insurance, and housing systems, <u>and</u>
 the best way to get laid-off workers out of poverty is to help them find jobs, Li stressed.</p>
<p>Again the second clause stands in opposition to the first. The intended meaning is: yes, we will take these other measures to make things easier for the unemployed, but the most important thing we can do is to help them find jobs. The sentence should have been revised to make that relation clear:</p>
<p>-Efforts will be made to introduce pensions, medical insurance, and housing systems, <i>but</i>
 the best way to get laid-off workers out of poverty is to help them find jobs, Li stressed.</p>
<p>Sometimes a translator makes the opposite mistake and puts a word indicating contrast or opposition where the sense demands one expressing addition or amplification. Here is an example from the draft translation of an editorial published in March of 1950. (The "public grain" referred to was a portion of the harvest collected by the central government as a tax in kind. )</p>
<p>-In most of these new areas last autumn's public grain, which constitutes the greater part of national revenue, was collected only in January and February of this year. <u>However</u>
 , in many localities it has not yet been collected; tax collection in newly liberated areas has not been organized very quickly.</p>
<p>The first sentence tells readers that in most of the newly liberated areas there is a problem: taxes in grain were collected late. The second sentence says that in some places the problem is even more serious: taxes in grain have not been collected at all. Thus, the second idea, instead of contrasting with the first, as "however" indicates, expands upon it.</p>
<p>The polisher noticed the logical inconsistency in the draft translation and corrected it as follows:</p>
<p>-In most of these new areas last autumn's public grain, which constitutes the greater part of national revenue, was collected only in January and February of this year, <i>and</i>
 in many places it has <i>still</i>
 not been collected. It has taken time to organize tax collection in newly liberated areas.</p>
<p>"And" and "or" are often confused as well. In Chapter IX we have already seen two examples of sentences in which "and" was used when logic demanded "or."In revision 8 (pages 267－268) "low temperatures <u>and</u>
 early frosts" was changed to "low temperatures <i>or</i>
 early frosts," because the two did not necessarily coincide. And in revision 10 (pages 269－270) "the national bourgeoisie adopted the neutral <u>and</u>
 sympathetic <u>and</u>
 even cooperative attitude toward revolution" was changed to "neutral, sympathetic, <i>or</i>
 even cooperative" because these were three different attitudes.</p>
<p>Here is another example:</p>
<p>-Yunnan Province will also build <u>and</u>
 upgrade the highways leading from Kunming to such areas as Sichuan Province, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Plainly, the same highway cannot be both built and upgraded. What the writer meant to say was:</p>
<p>-Yunnan Province will also build <i>or</i>
 upgrade highways leading from Kunming to such areas as....</p>
<p>[Note the absence of the definite article "the" : we cannot speak of "the highways" leading from one place to another if some of them do not yet exist.]</p>
<p>There are no formal rules to help Chinese translators avoid mistakes of this kind in English. The best advice is probably the simplest: pay attention to the connectives you use, and before you choose one, give some thought to the logical relation between the ideas you are expressing.</p>

<p>[-In the first sentence the speaker tells Party leaders that when they speak or write they are too repetitive. In the second he concedes that repetition is sometimes necessary but urges them to try to reduce it.</p>

 a correct understanding of Mao Zedong Thought as an integral whole.</p>
<p>[-These two sentences present two contrasted alternatives. Deng was proposing that the Party be guided by a "correct understanding" of Mao Zedong Thought rather than by Hua Guofeng's "erroneous notion."In A-version this relation is only implied.</p>
<p>-In the revision "instead" was added to underline the contrast between Deng's "understanding" and Hua's, and also to make it clear that one was to replace the other.</p>

<p>B: This fact tells us that the policies of the feudal rulers were intended to weaken certain nationalities. This was <i>also and particularly</i>
 true of the policies of the imperialists.</p>
<p>[-The structure of A-version implies that the imperialists were part of the group of feudal rulers. (For example, if the statement were, "All his new colleagues were friendly; this was particularly true of Chen," the reader would understand that Chen was one of the group of colleagues. )</p>
<p>-In other words, "particularly" by itself gives a false indication of the logical connection between the two sentences.</p>
<p>-In the revision "also" was introduced to show that the two groups—foreign imperialists and domestic feudal rulers—were separate, although alike in their policies.</p>
<p>-Since "particularly" had to be retained for the meaning, the result was the somewhat unusual double connective, "also and particularly."</p>

 : "Imperialist policies" was changed to "the policies of the imperialists" to create parallel structure with the preceding "the policies of the feudal rulers.")]</p>
<p>4) A: They [local governments] bear full responsibility for collecting public grain and taxes, for storing and transporting grain, and for supervising the local enterprises and helping them carry out the tasks assigned by the parent ministries. If local governments do not help in this connection, it will be impossible for these enterprises to fulfill their tasks according to plan.</p>
<p>B: They bear full responsibility for collecting public grain and taxes, for storing and transporting grain, and for supervising the local enterprises and helping them carry out the tasks assigned by the parent ministries. <i>Indeed,</i>
 without such assistance from local governments, it will be impossible for these enterprises to fulfill their tasks according to plan.</p>
<p>[-The second sentence adds an idea that not only supports but intensifies the first. The sequence of ideas is: (1) local governments have certain responsibilities that they must fulfill; (2) it is absolutely essential for them to fulfill those responsibilities, because otherwise....</p>
<p>-In the revision this reinforcement was neatly indicated by "Indeed."]</p>
<p>5) A: This led to a disparity between the purchasing and selling prices [of grain], so the state had to make up the difference. This is contrary to the law of value. On the one hand, we cannot arouse the enthusiasm of the peasants for production, and on the other hand the state bears a heavy burden—that is, every year it must use dozens of billions of yuan for subsidies. It is impossible for the state to use many funds for economic development and for education, science, and cultural undertakings.</p>
<p>B: This led to a disparity between the purchasing and selling prices, so the state had to make up the difference. This is contrary to the law of value. On the one hand, we cannot arouse the enthusiasm of the peasants for production, and on the other hand the state bears a heavy burden—that is, every year it must use tens of billions of yuan for subsidies. <i>Consequently,</i>
 the state doesn't have enough money for economic development, <i>let alone</i>
 for educational, scientific, and cultural undertakings.</p>
<p>[-In the first two sentences the speaker says the state spends enormous amounts of money on grain subsidies; in the third he says the state is short of funds needed for other purposes. The relation between the two ideas is one of cause and effect, but in A-version that is only implied.</p>
<p>-The polisher made it explicit by adding "Consequently."</p>
<p>-There was nothing in A-version to indicate the relative importance of the several alternative uses for funds mentioned in the last sentence (economic development, education, science, culture).</p>
<p>-The polisher knew, however, that at the time when these words were spoken (1988), economic development was to take precedence over everything else. She therefore changed the "and" in the draft version, which indicated the equality of the following items, to "let alone," which indicated the primacy of economic development over the other three.</p>
<p>-It is instructive to note that the polisher in this instance happened to be a foreigner who could not read the Chinese original. Accordingly, she based her proposed revisions solely on the implied logic of the English version and on her knowledge of the period.</p>
<p>-But when a second, Chinese polisher later reviewed the work, comparing it with the original, she found that the notions introduced by the foreigner—"consequently" and "let alone"—were indeed expressed in the Chinese and had been omitted by the first translator only through error.</p>
<p>-Thus, either method would have sufficed to discover the faults in the A-version: a thoughtful analysis of the English or a careful comparison with the Chinese.</p>
<p>-("Dozens of billions of yuan" was changed to "tens of billions of yuan" because when it is a question of money, English-speakers habitually count in units of ten, not twelve. Since the figure mentioned here was only a rough estimate, the discrepancy between the English version and the Chinese made no difference. Naturally, where exact numbers are important, "tens" cannot be substituted for "dozens.")]</p>
<p>6) A: It [the newly formed Central Advisory Commission] is aimed at lowering the average age of members of the Central Committee <u>and</u>
 making it possible for some elderly comrades who have retired from the forefront of affairs to continue to play a certain role.</p>
<p>B: The purpose of establishing this commission is to lower the average age of members of the Central Committee <i>and at the same time</i>
 to make it possible for some elderly comrades who have retired from the forefront of affairs to continue to play a certain role.</p>
<p>[-"And" is basically the right conjunction here, because it expresses the addition of a second aim to the first.</p>
<p>-The Central Advisory Commission, however, was formed for two separate though complementary purposes, and "and" alone does not suffice to bring this out.</p>
<p>-In B-version "at the same time" was added to make a clearer separation between the two purposes.</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : The polisher changed "aimed at" primarily because a commission is not "aimed at" anything. Another consideration, however, was her desire to resist the noun plague. "It is aimed at" had to be followed by gerunds ("lowering" and "making"), whereas "The purpose is" led to verbs (the infinitives "to lower" and "to make").]</p>
<p>7) A: We should appreciate it if all enterprises in your country [Japan]—large, medium-sized and small—strengthened their cooperation with us. We hope the Japanese government will encourage them to take a longer-range view. China lacks funds <u>and</u>

<p>B: We should appreciate it if all enterprises in your country—large, medium-sized and small—strengthened their cooperation with us. We hope the Japanese government will encourage them to take a longer-range view. China is short of funds <i>and for that reason</i>
 has been unable to develop many of its resources. If they are developed, we shall be able to supply more of Japan's needs. <i>So</i>
 , if Japan invests in China now, it will benefit greatly in future.</p>
<p>[-The key sentence in this series is the third one: "China lacks funds and has many resources that are yet to be developed."But that sentence is not clear. To the speaker, the connection between the two statements it contains is obvious, but that does not mean it is obvious to the reader.</p>
<p>-The logical relation between the ideas—China lacks funds; China has many undeveloped resources—is one of cause and effect. "And," the connective in A-version, cannot convey that relation.</p>
<p>-In B-version the meaning was spelled out in "for that reason."</p>
<p>-The polisher thought that a connective was needed between the last two sentences as well. Judging that the intended relation was again one of cause and effect, she put, "So, if Japan invests in China now... ."]</p>
<p>8) A: In 1978 we held the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and in a few days we shall convene the Third Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee, which will have its own special features. The first Third Plenary Session focused on rural reform, <u>and</u>

 this Third Plenary Session will focus on urban reform, including the reform of industry, commerce, and other sectors.</p>
<p>[-In these two clauses the second idea is not consistent with the first but in contrast to it: "the first meeting focused on x, but this one will focus on y."Here again, the "and" in A-version fails to indicate the right connection.</p>
<p>-To mark the contrast, the polisher changed "and" to "whereas."</p>

 : In the second sentence, "centre on urban reform" was changed to "focus on urban reform" to mark the parallel structure of the two clauses by repeating the word "focus.")]</p>
<p>9) A: While fighting corruption, we must demonstrate our will not to change the policies of reform and opening to the outside world <u>and</u>
 our resolve to deepen the reform and open even wider to the outside world.</p>
<p>B: While fighting corruption, we must demonstrate our resolve not to change the current policies <i>but, on the contrary,</i>
 to deepen the reform and open even wider to the outside world.</p>
<p>[-This sentence presents two ideas: "our resolve to deepen the reform and open even wider" and "our will not to change" those policies. The "and" that connects them in A-version seems quite reasonable, and it is grammatically correct because it joins two equal notions: "we must demonstrate our will... and our resolve."</p>
<p>-Nevertheless, "and" does not express the intended relation between the two objects of "demonstrate."In reality, the second idea ("our resolve to deepen") is meant not as a simple addition to the first ("our will not to change") but as a contradiction of it. The meaning is: far from changing the policies, we intend to do just the opposite.</p>
<p>-To express that meaning, the polisher changed "and" to "but, on the contrary."</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : This example has already been cited in Chapter V, page 131, as revision 8. There it was offered to show that the repetition of the long formula "reform and opening to the outside world" could be avoided by use of the single word "current.")]</p>
<p>10) A: We can't expect to participate in many events in the next Olympic Games in 1956. Six years <u>later</u>
 , by 1960, many top athletes will emerge if our sports activities are undertaken along the correct path.</p>
<p>B: We can't expect to participate in many events in the next Olympic Games in 1956. <i>But</i>
 by 1960, six years <i>from now,</i>
 many top athletes will emerge if our sports program is carried out correctly.</p>
<p>[-"Later" can be a useful connective indicating a time sequence, but here it is the wrong one and therefore confusing. Coming after the reference to 1956, "six years later" means 1962, not 1960. The speaker, who made this remark in 1954, meant "six years from now."The change was made in the revision.</p>
<p>-With this correction, the two ideas were clear enough, but they were simply "laid side by side" without any apparent logical connection. Even an inattentive reader would feel that something was missing.</p>
<p>-In the revision "But" was inserted as a link showing that the second idea was in contrast to the first.]</p>
<p>11) A: This policy of completely decentralized management was appropriate for the separated liberated areas, <u>so</u>
 we accomplished a great deal. Last year we made rapid progress in the War of Liberation: in that one year, all of China's mainland was liberated, except for Tibet, to form a continuous liberated area. Under these circumstances, much of our financial and economic work had to be unified.</p>
<p>B: This policy of completely decentralized management was appropriate <i>at a time when</i>
 the liberated areas were separated geographically, <i>and it enabled us</i>
 to accomplish a great deal. <i>But</i>
 last year we made rapid progress in the war: in that one year we took over the entire mainland, except for Tibet, making it one continuous liberated area. Under these <i>new</i>
 circumstances, much of our financial and economic work had to be unified.</p>
<p>[-The point of this paragraph (from a 1950 editorial) is that the situation has changed and that the policy has had to change in consequence. Most of the revisions in the draft version, particularly those relating to logical connectives, were made to bring this out.</p>
<p>-"Appropriate for the separated liberated areas" was spelled out for greater clarity and, especially, to underline the time element: "appropriate at a time when the liberated areas were separated geographically."</p>
<p>-"So we accomplished a great deal" was changed to "and it enabled us to accomplish a great deal."This strengthened the connection between the policy of decentralization and the accomplishments, emphasizing that the policy had been useful at that time.</p>
<p>-In the second and third sentences, starting at "Last year we made rapid progress," the writer expresses an opposing idea: that good as it was, this policy is no longer appropriate. "But" was inserted to prepare the reader for the change of direction.</p>
<p>-"Under these circumstances" was changed to "under these new circumstances" to stress the writer's point that the situation is different now.</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : "All of China's mainland was liberated... to form a continuous liberated area" was changed to active voice. "We took over" was used instead of "we liberated" to avoid three appearances of the same word in so short a passage. "China's" was dropped because it was obvious. )]</p>

 it would be wrong for us to consider only the most important and urgent projects to the neglect of others.</p>
<p>[-The first two sentences stress the importance of undertaking high-priority projects first. The third ("Likewise, it is wrong etc.") says we must not neglect the others. Plainly, the third sentence provides not a supporting idea that amplifies the first one but an opposing idea that reduces its force.</p>
<p>-To express the opposition between the two ideas, the polisher changed "likewise," an indicator of similarity, to "on the other hand," an indicator of difference.</p>

 : In the first sentence, "importance and urgency" was changed to "priority" partly to avoid using "important" and "importance" in the same sentence and partly to express the idea more concisely. )]</p>
<p>13) A: However, it is not possible to train intellectuals of working class and peasant origins all at once. That calls for planned steps and long-term effort.

The difficulty is especially great because our workers and peasants have long suffered from exploitation and oppression, and many of them are illiterate. Precisely <i>because this problem is so difficult</i>
 , university educators should pay more attention to it.</p>
<p>[-The third sentence in A-version ("The difficulty is especially great") says that the problem is particularly difficult and explains why. The fourth ("educators should pay more attention") is the conclusion drawn from the preceding statement.</p>
<p>-The implied meaning is: "the problem is particularly difficult; therefore you should pay more attention to it."In short, the relation between the ideas is one of cause and effect.</p>
<p>-The connective in A-version, however—"Difficult as it is"—means not "because it is difficult" but rather "although it is difficult."</p>
<p>-To make the right logical connection, expressing what she perceived to be the speaker's intention, the polisher changed "Difficult as it is" to "Precisely because this problem is so difficult."</p>

<p>14) A: As CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin said in his report delivered to the 15th congress, the battle against corruption is vital to the very existence of both the Party and the country. <u>Besides</u>

<p>B: As CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin said in his report to the 15th congress, the battle against corruption is vital to the very existence of both the Party and the country. If graft among officials cannot be eliminated, ordinary people will lose confidence in the government. <i>Though</i>
 people in every corner of the world have almost the same feeling of disgust for corruption, East Asian people, especially the Chinese, usually set <i>particularly</i>
 high moral standards for government officials.</p>
<p>[-The first sentence in A-version states that "the battle against corruption is vital to the very existence of both the Party and the country."The next one says that if that battle is lost, ordinary people will lose confidence in the government.</p>
<p>-The "Besides" that introduces the second idea suggests that it is almost an afterthought—a separate and lesser potential consequence of unchecked corruption.</p>
<p>-It seems, rather, that this second idea is of prime importance and an integral part of the first. It would be precisely because people had lost confidence in the government that "the very existence" of the Party and the country would be threatened.</p>
<p>-The polisher decided that the tight logical connection between the two sentences was evident without additional words and simply deleted the misleading "Besides."</p>
<p>-In the last sentence of A-version, the two clauses state: (1) people everywhere despise corruption; (2) East Asian people set high standards for government. Those two ideas are entirely consistent. Consequently, the opening "Though," which sets up in the reader's mind the expectation of a contradiction, is misleading, and the sentence makes no sense.</p>
<p>-To make it logical, the polisher had only to insert the word "particularly.""Though" now introduced a reasonable contrast: between people everywhere, who all despise corruption, and East Asians, who set particularly high standards for officials and therefore (presumably) despise it more than most.</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : The order of clauses in the second sentence—"people will lose confidence... if graft cannot be eliminated"—was reversed to put the subordinate idea first and the main one at the end. Note that in the last sentence—"Though the sentiments of disgust... East Asian people"—the order of clauses was already correct in A-version. )]</p>
<p>15) A: The Chinese Communist Party put forward a proposal that we should establish a new China which would be, in the words of Mao Zedong, "independent, free, democratic, united, prosperous, and powerful."<u>While</u>

<p>[-"While" is a subordinating conjunction that introduces a subordinate (dependent) clause. By definition, such a clause cannot stand independently as a complete sentence. (Cf. clauses introduced by "although," "until, "when," etc. )</p>

<p>B: Being in the position of leadership, the central authorities, including the Central Committee and the State Council, have a better overall view of the general situation, but they are liable to ignore certain immediate interests of the masses. <i>On the other hand,</i>
 the local authorities, who can easily get close to the masses, know more about local concerns, particular problems, and the immediate interests of the people.</p>
<p>[-The first problem with A-version is that it is all one sentence. English-readers cannot absorb so much information at one time without a pause; by the time they get to the end of the sentence they have forgotten the beginning. Mindful of this, the polisher's first concern was to break the sentence in two.</p>
<p>-The logical point for the break was at "while."But this posed a grammatical problem: as we have just seen, a "while" clause cannot stand alone as a separate sentence.</p>
<p>-"While" was plainly being used here in the sense of "whereas."But "whereas" was ruled out as a possible replacement because it too is a subordinating conjunction that can only introduce a subordinate clause.</p>
<p>-The polisher's solution was to start the new sentence with—again—"On the other hand."This overcame the grammatical difficulty and at the same time made a sound logical connection between the two ideas: the central authorities may ignore local interests; local authorities, on the other hand, will not.</p>

<p>17) A: Such an open statement of strategy and tactics <u>when</u>
 fighting was still going on is unusual in world history of wars. Mao <u>also</u>
 pointed out that because the PLA's strategy and tactics were based on a people's war, no army opposed to the people could use them or cope with them.</p>
<p>B: Military leaders in world history have seldom made such an open statement of their strategy and tactics <i>while</i>
 fighting was still going on. <i>But</i>
 Mao pointed out that because the PLA's strategy and tactics were based on a people's war, no army opposed to the people could either adopt them or defeat them.</p>
<p>[-The statement was issued at the same time that the fighting was going on; indeed, that is the central point of the passage.</p>
<p>-"When" is not a wrong connective here, but there is another conjunction that better conveys precisely this relation of simultaneity: "while."The polisher therefore put "while" in the revision, confident that in this usage, for once, it was irreproachable.</p>
<p>-The first sentence says that it was unusual for a military commander to reveal his strategy and tactics while a war was still in progress. The second tells why Mao felt free to do so: the enemy could not take advantage of the knowledge. The logical relation between the two sentences is that such a statement was unusual, but Mao could make it without risk.</p>
<p>-With this understanding, the polisher changed the translator's "Also," which was confusing, to a "But."</p>

 her leadership and negotiating skills that the customers eventually received 5 billion yen in compensation from the Japanese company.</p>
<p>[-A-version is understandable, but that is in spite of the all-purpose "with," which is not logical here. As it stands, it suggests that the customers were compensated with her leadership and 5 billion yen.</p>
<p>-In the revision "with" was replaced by a more precise term that accurately expressed the relation between her leadership and the compensation.]</p>
<p>20) <i>The following passage is taken from a pre-Liberation document. The speaker is addressing the question of how many bonds the people's government should issue in the territory under its control. The proportion of private enterprise in the different areas is important because it is mainly in that sector that potential purchasers of the bonds are to be found.</i>
</p>
<p>A: <u>With</u>
 China's vast territory, government bonds to the value of 120 million silver dollars do not represent a big sum. <u>In comparison</u>
 , Chiang Kai-shek wants to issue 200 million silver dollars' worth of government bonds in the shrinking area still under his control. He always did this in the past whenever he was at the end of his tether. Northeast China, <u>with</u>
 its 40 million people, has a much lower proportion of private enterprise than areas south of the Great Wall. It decided to issue, in two installments, government bonds amounting to a value of 12 million silver dollars, and the first installment has already been sold on schedule. <u>With</u>
 a much greater proportion of private enterprise, areas south of the Great Wall can set a higher target for bond issues.</p>
<p>B: (1) <i>Considering</i>
 China's vast territory, 120 million silver dollars' worth of government bonds is not a large amount. <i>For purposes of comparison,</i>
 Chiang Kai-shek wants to issue 200 million silver dollars' worth of bonds (2) <i>just</i>
 in the shrinking area still under his control. That's what he has always done when he was at the end of his tether. Northeast China, (3) <i>for all</i>
 its 40 million people, has a much lower proportion of private enterprise than areas south of the Great Wall. (4) <i>Yet</i>
 the authorities there have decided to issue, in two installments, government bonds amounting to a value of 12 million silver dollars, and the first installment has already been sold on schedule. (5) <i>Thus</i>
 , in areas south of the Great Wall, (6) <i>where</i>
 there is a much greater proportion of private enterprise, higher targets can be set for bond issues.</p>
<p>[-In A-version this long and closely reasoned passage has only four logical connectives to help the reader follow the argument. One is the useful "in comparison" ; the other three are vague "with" s.</p>
<p>-As a result, the reader is faced with what seems to be a string of unrelated, or only loosely related, facts from which it is hard to draw any understanding of the speaker's point.</p>
<p>-In B-version half a dozen changes were made to clarify the relations between ideas. They were the following:</p>
<p>-(1) The opening "With" had no clear meaning. It was therefore changed to the more precise "Considering."</p>
<p>-(2) "Just" was added to indicate that the large amount of bonds that Chiang wanted to issue would be sold only in a relatively small area.</p>
<p>-(3) "With" its 40 million people simply gives a fact without telling the reader its significance. The logical connection between the high population and the relatively low proportion of private enterprise is one of contrast: "for all its 40 million people" (= in spite of having 40 million people, even though it has 40 million people).</p>
<p>-(4) The preceding sentence tells readers that there is relatively little private enterprise in Northeast China. This one says that Northeast China has decided to issue bonds in the amount of x. In A-version the two facts are simply juxtaposed without explanation. The intended sense is that even though there is not much private enterprise, a large number of bonds have already been issued and sold there. In B-version "Yet" was inserted to announce the contradiction.</p>
<p>-(5) In A-version there is nothing to show readers that they have come to the conclusion of a line of argument. In the revision this was signaled by "Thus."</p>
<p>-(6) In A-version "with" makes only a loose connection between the "areas south of the Great Wall" and the "much greater proportion of private enterprise."In the revision the prepositional phrase was replaced by a clear subordinate clause: "where there is a much greater proportion."</p>
<p>-(In the last sentence, although active voice is generally preferable to passive, "areas south of the Great Wall can set higher targets" was changed to "in areas south of the Great Wall higher targets can be set."This was done to avoid personifying "areas."People—officials, authorities, etc.—can set targets, and so can political or administrative entities—a province, for example, or Northeast China, as above. But in English mere geographical "areas" cannot make decisions of any kind. )]</p>
<h3 id="c7">Twenty exercises</h3>
<p>A number of the examples in this set of exercises are necessarily longer than usual. This means that the draft versions often presented many errors in addition to wrong or missing logical connectives. These other errors have been corrected, so that you can concentrate exclusively on the meaning of each passage and the logical relation of its parts.</p>
<p>Also because of the length of the examples, words added or changed in the proposed revisions in the key have been italicized. This will make it easier for you to compare the revisions with your own versions.</p>
<p>As always, the revisions offered are not necessarily the only "right answers."Where you find a "however," a "but" might do just as well; a "therefore" might be substituted for an "accordingly," and so on.</p>
<p>1) The vast majority of workers, city dwellers, and even members of the middle and lower petty bourgeoisie were brought to the brink of disaster. The rural economy went into a sharp recession.</p>
<p>2) If the North-South problem is not solved, it will hinder the development of the world economy. The solution, of course, lies in North-South dialogue, and we support dialogue. But dialogue alone is not enough; cooperation among Third World countries—in other words, South-South cooperation—should be stepped up.</p>
<p>3) There is no doubt that the system of management described above is much more centralized than the one that was in effect last year. If we were asked how many undertakings will still be under decentralized management, we would have to answer, a great many.</p>
<p>4) At first, the Yangtze Automotive Chassis Plant will be able to assemble 60, 000 chassis a year for one-and two-ton trucks. With the completion of construction, it will have an annual capacity of 100, 000 chassis.</p>
<p>5) It is not necessary to launch such a movement [against the "five evils" ] now. In Shanghai 160, 000 cases of tax evasion have been uncovered, and most of them are medium or minor ones. These cases of tax evasion vary in seriousness, and there are also defects in our tax system. These things have to be addressed and rectified, but there is no need for a lesser movement against the "five evils."</p>
<p>6) Not much progress has been made in the talks on control of nuclear arms and of weapons in outer space. That's why for many years we emphasized the danger of war. Recently, there have been some changes in our views. We now think that although there is still the danger of war, the forces that can deter it are growing, and we find that encouraging.</p>
<p>7) Some people think that since China is emphasizing the importance of ideals, that means it is going to close its doors again. That is not true. We are soberly aware of the possible negative effects of the open policy and will not ignore them. Our principle is not to close but to continue to open. We may open even wider in the future.</p>
<p>8) At that session [the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee], we criticized the "two whatevers" and put forward the slogan, "We must emancipate our minds and put our brains to work."</p>
<p>9) All local authorities and departments should make the improvement of the performance of large and medium-sized state enterprises an important item on their agendas, taking practical measures to create a favorable environment for their production and operation and to help them reduce losses and increase profits. Basically, state enterprises must rely on their own efforts to extricate themselves from their predicament. While actively carrying out the reform, they should adjust their mix of products to conform to the demands of domestic and international markets, produce readily marketable goods, keep developing new products, and enhance their ability to adapt to the market and compete.</p>
<p>10) Changchun has now reached an annual production capacity of 400, 000 automobiles with over 100 models of medium trucks, light vehicles, and sedans.</p>
<p>11) As late as May 1926 he [Chiang Kai-shek] still stated, "Not only am I not opposed to Communism, but I very much approve of it."For the time being, the KMT continued to cooperate with the CPC. The fact that command over the Northern Expeditionary Army was largely in Chiang's hands made it clear that while the revolution was progressing rapidly, it was already in a serious crisis.</p>
<p>12) If China, with its one billion people, took the capitalist road, it would be a disaster for the world. It would be a retrogression of history, a retrogression of many years. If China, with its one billion people, abandoned the policy of peace and opposition to hegemonism or if, as the economy developed, it sought hegemony, that would also be a disaster for the world, a retrogression of history. If China, with its one billion people, keeps to socialism and adheres to the policy of peace, it will be following the right course and will be able to make greater contributions to humanity.</p>
<p>13) "Graft, bribery, and other corruption cases have become quite serious, while crimes involving the exchange of power for money are spreading among some government departments and officials," Liang told a national conference of provincial procurators on Wednesday. "So, we must focus attention on such developments, but not underestimate the seriousness of the threat posed by corruption."</p>
<p>14) Shen says that research and production of friction materials for motor vehicles in China had always been based on asbestos, which is both cheap and plentiful in the country. At present there are close to 30 manufacturers with a total annual production of more than 20, 000 tons of friction materials, most of which are made from asbestos. Realizing that asbestos was a hazardous substance and that international manufacturers were no longer using it, Shen made up her mind to develop China's own non-asbestos materials.</p>
<p>15) Zhou announced at the reception that he had asked Hu Zongnan personally if he had sent his troops defending the Yellow River west to prepare an attack on the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. "Deputy Commander Hu told me," he said, "that he had no intention of attacking the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and that the troops under his command would take no such action. I was very happy to hear this, and I believe everyone else will be happy, too."Hu's scheme to attack the region was made known to the public.</p>
<p>16) With a 30-year history, the museum is dedicated to the collection of items related to ancient China, Chinese paintings and calligraphy, historical pictures, and contemporary Hong Kong art.</p>
<p>17) If the CPC [in 1937] were to give up its proletarian stand of independence and initiative [as recommended by the Comintern], make no distinction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, refrain from arousing the masses, and try to appease the bourgeoisie in all matters so as to maintain the united front, it would only weaken the position of the proletariat, put the united front at the mercy of the bourgeoisie, and eventually bring about China's defeat. After he arrived in Yan'an, Wang Ming did everything possible to carry out this "new policy" of the Communist International.</p>
<p>18) The objective reasons [for the revival of the CPC after the failure of the Great Revolution of 1924－1927] were as follows.... Many of the troops that had previously been engaged in attempts to encircle and suppress the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army were moved to other battlefields to take part in [the warfare between the new rival warlords], leaving a vacuum in certain areas and an opportunity for the Red Army to grow. Under the rule of the KMT government, the national crisis was aggravated. Every one of the fundamental contradictions in Chinese society became intensified, and the Nanjing government grew increasingly fascist.... Discontent was growing even among those who had cherished illusions about the KMT.</p>
<p>19) The principal contradiction in Chinese society in the present stage is the one between the growing material and cultural needs of the people and the backwardness of production. To promote the all-round progress of society, we must give priority to the growth of the productive forces and make economic development our central task.</p>
<p>20) The venture, named Huazhong-Warner Transmission Co., Ltd., has a total investment of 255 million yuan ($30. 72 million), with Borg-Warner contributing 60 percent.</p>
