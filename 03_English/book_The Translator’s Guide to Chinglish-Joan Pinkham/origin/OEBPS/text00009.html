<title>V. Repeated References to the Same Thing</title>
</head>
<body style="font-family:cnepub,serif;">
<h2>V. Repeated References to the Same Thing</h2>
<p>There is one more group of unnecessary words in Chinglish that we need to examine. These words occur when, in a given sentence or brief passage, there are two or more references to the same thing.</p>
<p>Sometimes, after the first mention of an idea, the subsequent references to it can be dispensed with entirely; more often, they need to be retained but can be shortened. We shall consider examples of both types.</p>
<h3 id="c1">Repeated references that can be dispensed with</h3>
<p>In some sentences where the same idea is mentioned two or more times, there is no logical necessity for it. In the following examples, the repetition adds nothing to the meaning of the passage. Accordingly, it is only another form of redundancy, and the superfluous words should simply be edited out.</p>
<p>A: Statistics show that from 1990 to 1994, imported <u>vehicles</u>
 totalled 960, 000 <u>units</u>
 , compared with the four million <u>vehicles</u>
 produced in the country.</p>
<p>B: Statistics show that from 1990 to 1994, 960, 000 <i>vehicles</i>
 were imported, while four million were produced domestically.</p>
<p>[Vehicles = units. The sentence can easily be revised so that the idea is mentioned only once.]</p>
<p>A: A minimum of 50, 000 kilometers of road test is <u>required</u>
 for the prototype of a regular truck, as <u>mandated</u>
 by the central government, before it can be approved for quantity production.</p>
<p>B: The prototype of a regular truck is <i>required</i>
 to go through 50, 000 kilometers of road test before the central government will approve it for mass production.</p>
<p>[-Required = mandated.</p>
<p>-("A minimum" can be dispensed with because the notion is implicit in "required.")]</p>
<p>A: Now let me discuss how we can overcome our <u>financial and economic</u>
 difficulties this autumn and how we should strive for a turn for the better regarding our <u>financial and economic</u>
 situation next year.</p>
<p>B: Now let me discuss how we can overcome our <i>financial and economic</i>
 difficulties this autumn and how we can improve the situation next year.</p>
<p>[-The meaning of "situation" is clear from the context, even without the second "financial and economic."</p>
<p>-("Strive for a turn for the better regarding" is only a wordy expression for "improve.")]</p>
<h3 id="c2">Repeated references that need to be retained</h3>
<p>Repetition, however, is not always redundancy. Indeed, certain types of repetition are indispensable to normal, consecutive discourse.</p>
<p>Consider the following outline of a paragraph:</p>
<p>
<u>The National Conference on Iron and Steel Production</u>
 was held in Beijing from this date to that, by such-and-such a ministry under the auspices of so-and-so. <u>The National Conference on Iron and Steel Production</u>
 drew up a national plan for this and laid down the principle of doing that. <u>The National Conference on Iron and Steel Production</u>
 also discussed the problem of such-and-such. <u>The National Conference on Iron and Steel Production</u>
 decided to take the following measures. All in all, <u>the National Conference on Iron and Steel Production</u>
 was a great success.</p>
<p>Plainly, if we were forbidden ever to refer to the same thing twice in succession, there could be no logical progression of ideas as there is here. Every sentence would have to have a different subject, and the result would be incoherent nonsense.</p>
<p>This does not mean, however, that every time an idea is repeated it must be spelled out in full. In the sample paragraph above, the constant repetition of the entire title is an enormous waste of words (and, to the ear of a native speaker, decidedly irritating). Since in Chinese this is not so, or so only to a lesser extent, draft translations tend to contain many more exact repetitions than are tolerable in English.</p>
<h3 id="c3">Ways of shortening repeated references</h3>
<p>In English, once an idea has been expressed, subsequent references to it can almost always be shortened. The means vary, depending on whether the idea in question is based on a verb or a noun.</p>
<p>If <u>the idea is based on a verb</u>
 , the second reference might be replaced with an expression like "do so," "do the same," "do likewise," or "do this" :</p>
<p>A: It took three years for rural reform to <u>show results</u>
 , and it will take longer, three to five years, for urban reform to <u>show results</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: It took three years for rural reform to <i>show results</i>
 , and it will take longer, three to five years, for urban reform to <i>do so.</i>
</p>
<p>A: The United States needs to <u>extend trade privileges</u>
 to China <u>permanently</u>
 . Chen says that only by <u>making those privileges permanent</u>
 can the U. S. government ensure the long-term stability of American investments in China.</p>
<p>B: The United States needs to <i>extend trade privileges</i>
 to China <i>permanently</i>
 . Chen says that only by <i>doing so</i>
 can the U. S. government ensure the long-term stability of American investments in China.</p>
<p>A: We must strengthen our leadership and quickly correct our deficiencies as a means of <u>mobilizing and developing the potential of our intellectuals</u>
 . To <u>mobilize and develop the potential of our intellectuals</u>
 , we must first of all....</p>
<p>B: We must strengthen our leadership and quickly correct our deficiencies so as to <i>mobilize our intellectuals and develop their potential</i>
 . To <i>do this,</i>
 we must first of all....</p>
<p>[The word order of the second sentence has been changed to give "mobilizing" its proper object, which is "intellectuals," not "potential" as in A-version.]</p>
<p>If, as is more usual, <u>the idea is based on a noun</u>
 accompanied by modifiers, there are a number of means of abbreviating repeated references. Here we shall deal only with the three principal ones, plus a fourth that is available in special cases:</p>
<p>1. eliminating the modifiers</p>
<p>2. replacing the expression with a summary noun</p>
<p>3. replacing the expression with a pronoun</p>
<p>4. (in special cases) replacing the expression with initials</p>
<p>Following are examples of each.</p>
<p>1. <i>
<u>Eliminating the modifiers</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>The second reference to a noun accompanied by modifiers can often be made more concise simply by using the noun alone. As can be seen from the following examples, the meaning remains perfectly clear, confirming that the words omitted are indeed "unnec."</p>
<p>A: <u>The National Conference on Iron and Steel Production</u>
 was held in Beijing from this date to that, by such-and-such a ministry under the auspices of so-and-so. <u>The National Conference on Iron and Steel Production</u>
 drew up a national plan for this and laid down the principle of doing that.</p>
<p>B: <i>The National Conference on Iron and Steel Production</i>
 was held in Beijing from this date to that, by such-and-such a ministry under the auspices of so-and-so. <i>The Conference</i>
 drew up a national plan for this and laid down the principle of doing that.</p>
<p>A: This year we have issued one hundred million <i>fen</i>
 of <u>government bonds</u>
 , which has done much to withdraw currency from circulation and stabilize prices. However, we issued more <u>government bonds</u>
 than necessary.</p>
<p>B: This year we have issued one hundred million <i>fen</i>
 of <i>government bonds,</i>
 which has done much to withdraw currency from circulation and stabilize prices. However, we issued more <i>bonds</i>
 than necessary.</p>
<p>A: As far as the work of <u>the Central Advisory Commission</u>
 is concerned, its general functions are set forth in the new Constitution of the Communist Party of China. According to the Party Constitution, the members of <u>the Central Advisory Commission</u>
 are to act as political assistants and consultants to the Central Committee.</p>
<p>B: As far as the work of <i>the Central Advisory Commission</i>
 is concerned, its general functions are set forth in the new Constitution of the Communist Party of China. According to the Party Constitution, the members of <i>the Commission</i>
 are to act as political assistants and consultants to the Central Committee.</p>
<p>[Note than in A-version, the "Constitution of the Communist Party of China" has already been shortened, in the second reference, to "the Party Constitution," the modifiers "Communist" and "of China" being understood.]</p>
<p>Another way of eliminating modifiers in a second reference is to substitute a single word that represents them. The words most often used for this purpose are the demonstrative adjectives (this, that; these, those) and the possessive pronouns (my, your, his/her/its; our, your, their), which function as adjectives:</p>
<p>A: For our part, we have already made a concession by putting forward <u>the principle of "one country, two systems</u>
 ."We believe that eventually our motherland will be reunified based on <u>the principle of "one country, two systems</u>
 ."</p>
<p>B: For our part, we have already made a concession by putting forward <i>the principle of</i>
 "<i>one country</i>
 , <i>two systems</i>
 ."We believe that eventually our motherland will be reunified on the basis of <i>that principle</i>
 .</p>
<p>A: The first question is whether <u>the line, principles, and policies formulated</u>
 at the Third Plenary Session of the Party's Eleventh Central Committee, and our "three-stage" development strategy, are correct or not. Has the correctness of <u>the line, principles, and policies we have formulated</u>
 become a problem because of the turmoil?</p>
<p>B: The first question is whether <i>the line, principles, and policies formulated</i>
 at the Third Plenary Session of the Party's Eleventh Central Committee, including our "three-stage" development strategy, are correct. Has <i>their</i>
 correctness been placed in doubt because of the turmoil?</p>
<p>[The conjunction "and," which was probably lacking in the Chinese, was replaced with "including" for reasons of logic.]</p>
<p>A: Government sources reveal that Japanese manufacturers are stepping up their efforts to establish <u>auto-parts joint ventures</u>
 in China. Up to now 18 Japanese companies have set up 25 <u>auto-parts joint ventures</u>
 in a dozen provinces in China.</p>
<p>B: Government sources reveal that Japanese manufacturers are stepping up their efforts to establish <i>auto-parts joint ventures</i>
 in China. Eighteen Japanese companies have already set up 25 <i>such ventures</i>
 in a dozen provinces.</p>
<p>[<u>Review</u>
 : "In China" was omitted because it is understood.]</p>
<p>2. <i>
<u>Replacing the expression with a summary noun</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>In each of the three examples just given, a noun is present in A-version ("principle," "correctness," "ventures"), and all that is needed is to replace its accompanying modifiers with an all-purpose adjective. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to supply a general noun that, with or without an adjective, will neatly sum up the entire phrase being replaced:</p>
<p>A: it [the problem of bureaucracy and commandism] means failure to make clear the <u>policy limits and the proper style of work</u>
 when giving assignments, in other words, failure to give the cadres at the middle and lower levels receiving assignments thorough instructions on <u>policy limits and proper style of work</u>
</p>
<p>B: it means failure to make clear the <i>policy limits and the proper style of work</i>
 when giving assignments, in other words, failure to give cadres at the middle and lower levels receiving assignments thorough instructions on <i>these matters</i>
</p>
<p>A: We must adhere to the principle that <u>economic development</u>
 relies on <u>science and technology</u>
 , while development of <u>science and technology</u>
 is geared to the needs of <u>economic development</u>
 , and promote the organic combination of <u>science and technology</u>
 with the <u>economy</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: We must adhere to the principle that the <i>development of the economy should be based on science and technology</i>
 and that the <i>development of science and technology</i>
 should be geared to the needs of <i>the economy. The two</i>
 must be organically combined (<i>or</i>
 : must be integrated).</p>
<p>[-The first two mentions of economic development and science and technology are necessary to make the writer's point. The third mention, however, becomes tedious repetition and can be replaced simply by "the two."</p>
<p>-("Economic development" was changed to "the development of the economy" to make it parallel in form to "the development of science and technology.")]</p>
<p>A: The practice of the past decade has proved that the lines, principles, and policies adopted by the Party since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee are correct and that it is correct to carry out <u>the reform and opening up</u>
 .... <u>The reform and opening up</u>
 will not be accomplished in a short period of time.</p>
<p>B: The practice of the past decade has proved that the lines, principles, and policies adopted by the Party since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee are correct and that we are right to carry out <i>the reform and opening up.... These two tasks</i>
 will not be completed in a short time.</p>
<p>[-(The second use of "correct" was changed to "right" simply to avoid repeating the same sound. )</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : "A short period of time" is no more than "a short time," so "period" is an unnec. noun. )]</p>
<p>3. <i>
<u>Replacing the expression with a pronoun</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>The commonest means of condensing repeated references to an idea is to replace the spelled-out version with a pronoun. While pronouns appear relatively seldom in Chinese, their use is deeply rooted in English.</p>
<p>A: Why cannot <u>these lines and policies</u>
 be changed? Because the practice of the past ten years has proved that <u>these lines and policies</u>
 are completely correct.</p>
<p>B: Why cannot <i>these lines and policies</i>
 be changed? Because the practice of the last ten years has proved that <i>they</i>
 are correct.</p>
<p>[<u>Review</u>
 : "Correct" is sufficient (and stronger) without the adverb "completely."]</p>
<p>A: So the difficulties of the past no longer exist, and it is therefore possible to introduce <u>centralized management</u>
 sooner than we expected. We should not be afraid of minor difficulties from <u>centralized management</u>
 ; otherwise....</p>
<p>B: So the difficulties of the past no longer exist, and it is therefore possible to introduce <i>centralized management</i>
 sooner than we expected. We should not be dissuaded by the minor difficulties <i>this</i>
 will cause; otherwise....</p>
<p>[Here "this" stands for the introduction of centralized management.]</p>
<p>A: The ongoing <u>movement to eliminate counterrevolution</u>
 in the society at large is different from the previous <u>movements to suppress counterrevolution</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: The ongoing <i>movement to eliminate counterrevolution</i>
 in the society at large is different from the previous <i>ones.</i>
</p>
<p>4. <i>
<u>Replacing the expression with initials</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>When the thing referred to is an organization, institution, official body, or the like, a special means is available for abbreviating subsequent references to it: the entire name can frequently be reduced to initials. For example, the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, generally so called only at first mention in a formal context and usually shortened to "the Soviet Union," can, and very often is, further shortened to "the USSR."The Communist Party of China, spelled out, perhaps, at the beginning of a passage, becomes in later references "the Party" or just "the CPC."</p>
<p>Since in Chinese there are no initials—and since even the longest title can be expressed in just a few characters—translators often tend to overlook this means of avoiding wordiness. In English, however, its use is standard practice. Indeed, certain organizations become so well known by their initials that they are seldom referred to by their full names.</p>
<p>Thus, in defiance of logic, the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks are often spoken of as "the SALT talks."The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund remains "UNICEF" decades after its official name was changed to the United Nations Children's Fund, to which the initials no longer correspond.</p>
<p>And sometimes the full name disappears entirely. Who now remembers that the "Care" package we send to a friend, containing food, clothing, or other useful gifts, was originally one sent to needy people abroad, after World War II, by the private U. S. charity, Cooperative for American Remittances to Europe (later, the Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere)?</p>
<p>Occasionally, initials can be used to replace the full name of an entity even when it is not a capitalized title. For example, in an article in the magazine <i>Asiaweek</i>
 , the authors use initials not only for China's "gross domestic product" but also for phrases that are less familiar but equally awkward to spell out repeatedly: "special economic zones," "state-owned enterprises," and "township and village enterprises."</p>
<p>Readers of the newsweekly need no explanation of "GDP," which is never spelled out in the article. It should be noted, however, that before the other initials are used alone, they are carefully introduced in such a way as to make their meaning unmistakable:</p>
<p>-The nation's first four special economic zones—Zhuhai, Shenzhen, Xiamen and Shantou <i>SEZs</i>
 —were created in 1979 as labs for industrial reform.</p>
<p>-[Deng Xiaoping] brought Zhu to the capital permanently in 1991 to help revive the economy and tackle one of its most pressing and perplexing problems: the dismal performance of state-owned enterprises <i>(SOEs).</i>
</p>
<p>-Township and village enterprises expanded their share of industrial output from 22. 4% in 1978 to 34% in 1994. That year nearly 25 million <i>TVEs</i>
 employed about 120 million people, many of them former farmers put out of work by earlier reforms.</p>
<p>Once the meaning of these abbreviations has been established, they can be used lightly and flexibly, as in this later sentence:</p>
<p>-TVEs have an average of about five workers each, a size nimble enough to respond to market changes the way their SOE cousins can't.</p>
<p>The proliferation of initials in current English has no doubt been encouraged by journalistic practice, which sets a premium on economies of space and time. Their use, like any other device in writing, can be carried to excess. Still, you should bear in mind the possibility of replacing repeated references to the National People's Congress with "the NPC," the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences with "CASS," the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong with "the SAR," the US-China Peoples Friendship Association with "the USCPFA," and so on. The longer the full title, and the more frequently it appears, the greater the saving in words.</p>
<h3 id="c4">Another reason for avoiding exact repetition</h3>
<p>These means of effecting economies—the omissions and substitutions that can be used to shorten repeated references to the same thing—serve another function as well. They are useful, indeed required, not only because, as the early nineteenth century British grammarian William Cobbett says of pronouns [p. 13], they "make speaking and writing more rapid and less encumbered with words," but also because they prevent the repetition of the same sounds.</p>
<p>Most readers "hear" what they are reading (just as, on some level, they "hear" what they are thinking), and the ears of native speakers of English are highly sensitive to repetition. Where it is not used deliberately—as in poetry, for example, or for clarity, emphasis, or humorous effect—it is perceived as an annoyance and a distraction from the content.</p>
<p>The principle here is the simple one enunciated by Graves and Hodge [p. 164]: "The same word should not be so often used in the same sentence or paragraph that it becomes tedious."And it should be remembered that the point of tedium is reached very quickly.</p>
<p>Thus, even when, as in some of the B-versions offered above, there is only a small net saving of words or none at all, the revision, which avoids the immediate repetition of the same word or words, is still more natural and more acceptable in English than the draft version.</p>
<p>Following are two more examples in which the change of wording—here, the substitution of a pronoun—does little or nothing to make the statement more succinct but does much to make it more satisfying to the ear.</p>
<p>A: We have not met with too many difficulties in the course of <u>the reform</u>
 , and in general <u>the reform</u>
 is proceeding smoothly.</p>
<p>B: We have not met with too many difficulties in the course of <i>the reform,</i>
 and in general <i>it</i>
 is proceeding smoothly.</p>
<p>A: I think this <u>suggestion</u>
 can be adopted; it is a good <u>suggestion</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: I think this <i>suggestion</i>
 can be adopted; it is a good <i>one.</i>
</p>
<h3 id="c5">Twenty more examples of revision</h3>
<p>The format here is the same as in preceding chapters.</p>
<p>1) A: We must <u>oppose corruption</u>
 and promote clean government. We should not <u>do this</u>
 for only a couple of days or months but should <u>oppose corruption</u>
 in the whole process of reform and opening to the outside world.</p>
<p>B: We must <i>oppose corruption</i>
 and promote clean government. We should <i>do this</i>
 not just for a few days or months but throughout the process of reform and opening to the outside world.</p>
<p>[-In A-version the translator has already substituted "do this" for a second reference to opposing corruption. He or she failed to notice, however, that the third reference could simply be omitted without in any way affecting the meaning.</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : It could be argued that the first sentence says the same thing twice, in the mirror-image construction. )]</p>
<p>2) A: Those who wrongly or too repeatedly <u>criticized people</u>
 and those who correctly <u>criticized people</u>
 but overdid it should apologize to them for <u>doing that</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: Those who have <i>criticized people</i>
 wrongly, excessively or too often should apologize to the persons concerned.</p>
<p>[-"Excessively" expresses "overdid it" and makes it possible to eliminate the second "criticized people."</p>
<p>-"Doing that" is a good alternative to a third "criticizing," but the sense is implied in "apologize," so it too can be dispensed with.]</p>
<p>3) A: Many comrades, having been expelled from the Party, have come to <u>the Organization Department</u>
 of the Central Committee to <u>appeal</u>
 , or have sent letters of <u>appeal</u>
 to <u>the Department</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: Many comrades, having been expelled from the Party, have <i>appealed</i>
 to <i>the Organization Department</i>
 of the Central Committee, either in person or by letter.</p>
<p>[Here a simple change of structure suffices to eliminate the repetition.]</p>
<p>4) A: In order to satisfy the needs of <u>industrial enterprises</u>
 for various kinds of <u>materials</u>
 , and to spare <u>these enterprises</u>
 the trouble of sending out many people simply for the purchase of some necessary types of <u>materials</u>
 , the State Council has decided that....</p>
<p>B: To meet the needs of <i>industrial enterprises</i>
 for <i>materials</i>
 and to spare <i>them</i>
 the trouble of sending out many purchasing agents, the State Council has decided that....</p>
<p>[-The second reference to "industrial enterprises" can be replaced by the pronoun "them."</p>
<p>-Once "people for the purchase of" is reduced to "purchasing agents," the second "materials" can be eliminated: the meaning remains clear.</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : "Various kinds of" and "types of" are both unnec. with the plural "materials."The adjective "necessary" is redundant because we have already spoken of "needs.")]</p>
<p>5) <i>From the quarterly</i>
 U. S. -China Review:</p>
<p>A: The word "<u>socialism</u>
 " is explained [in a dictionary] by quoting Deng Xiaoping's words that the essence of <u>socialism</u>
 is to free <u>productive forces</u>
 , develop <u>productive forces</u>
 , <u>abolish</u>
 exploitation, <u>abolish</u>
 polarization and achieve common wealth finally.</p>
<p>B: The word "<i>socialism</i>
 " is explained by quoting Deng Xiaoping's statement that the essence of <i>socialism</i>
 is to free and develop the <i>productive forces</i>
 , <i>abolish</i>
 exploitation, <i>eliminate</i>
 polarization, and eventually achieve common prosperity.</p>
<p>[-The repetition of "socialism" is plainly necessary and, in this context, unobjectionable.</p>
<p>-There is no need, however, for two references to the "productive forces" or for two uses of the word "abolish."]</p>
<p>6) A: Another achievement [of the Congress] is that it elected a new leading body that will ensure continued and accelerated implementation of <u>our policies of reform and opening to the outside world</u>
 . Before <u>the Thirteenth National Congress</u>
 , <u>the world's people and the Chinese people</u>
 were somewhat concerned that <u>our policies of reform and opening to the outside world</u>
 might not be continued. But <u>the Thirteenth National Congress</u>
 has addressed this question, reassuring <u>the Chinese people</u>
 and our international friends.</p>
<p>B: Another achievement is that it elected a new leading body that will ensure continued and accelerated implementation of <i>our policies of reform and opening to the outside world.</i>

<p>[-At second reference, the modifiers of "Congress" were dropped, and the modifiers of "policies" were replaced by the demonstrative adjective "those."</p>
<p>-To avoid having "the world's people," "the Chinese people" and "the Chinese people" all in one sentence, the polisher combined the first two into "people at home and abroad."</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : "Somewhat" is superfluous because "concerned" is mild enough without a qualifier. )]</p>
<p>7) A: After the <u>local authorities</u>
 have turned over their public grain and tax receipts, the central <u>authorities</u>
 must ensure the funds needed to cover the expenses of <u>local governments</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: After <i>local governments</i>
 have turned over their public grain and tax receipts, the central <i>authorities</i>
 must provide them with funds to cover <i>their</i>
 expenses.</p>
<p>[-Local governments = local authorities, so the second reference to them can be reduced to the possessive pronoun "their."The pronoun "them" was added for clarity.</p>
<p>-"Local authorities" was changed to "local governments" to avoid repeating "authorities."]</p>
<p>8) A: While fighting corruption, we must demonstrate our will not to change the policies of <u>reform and opening to the outside world</u>
 and our resolve to <u>deepen the reform and open even wider to the outside world</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: While fighting corruption, we must demonstrate our resolve not to change <i>the current policies</i>
 but, on the contrary, to <i>deepen the reform and open even wider to the outside world.</i>
</p>
<p>[-"Current" can be used to replace one of the two long formulas.</p>
<p>-("Will" and "resolve" are so close in meaning that we don't need both. )</p>
<p>-(Adding "but, on the contrary," provides the logical connection between the ideas that is understood in Chinese but needs to be made explicit in English. )]</p>
<p>9) A: Our biggest experiment is the economic restructuring. <u>Reform</u>
 started first in the rural areas. It was after the <u>reform</u>
 there had produced results that we had the courage to carry out the urban <u>reform</u>
 . In fact, the urban <u>reform</u>
 is a <u>reform</u>
 of the economic structure as a whole and is very risky. The <u>reform</u>
 has just begun and some problems have already appeared.</p>
<p>B: Our biggest experiment is the restructuring of the economy. We started the <i>reform</i>
 first in the rural areas. It was only after <i>it had produced results there that we had the courage to launch it</i>
 in the cities. In fact, the urban <i>reform</i>
 is a <i>reform</i>
 of the economic structure as a whole and is very risky. <i>It</i>
 has only just begun, and some problems have already appeared.</p>
<p>[-Three of the six "reforms" can be readily replaced by "it."</p>
<p>-(The two "only" s were introduced to clarify the logic, which, again, is implicit in the Chinese but should be spelled out in English. In the third sentence, "only" underlines the meaning "we didn't dare begin in the cities until it had proved successful in the countryside," and in the last sentence, it prepares for and supports the "already.")]</p>
<p>10) A: Naturally, there are disagreements about <u>the reform</u>
 ; however, the difference is not about whether we should carry out <u>the reform</u>
 but about how deep <u>the reform</u>
 should go, and <u>how to reform</u>
 and open to the outside world.</p>
<p>B: Naturally, there are disagreements about <i>the reform;</i>
 but the disagreements are not over whether we should carry <i>it</i>
 out but over how deep <i>it</i>
 should go, <i>how it should be conducted and how we should go about opening</i>
 to the outside world.</p>
<p>[-Four "reform" s in one sentence are unacceptable, especially when the unsuspecting reader is required to recognize that although the first three are nouns, the fourth is suddenly a verb.</p>
<p>-The problem is easily solved by a change of structure. The fourth "reform" was converted to a noun also (not "how to reform" but "how the reform should be conducted"). The pronoun "it" could then be substituted for the last three.]</p>
<p>11) A: <u>The cost of moving grain</u>
 is high: on average, it is equal to <u>the price of the grain</u>
 transported, and in some places <u>transportation charges</u>
 exceed <u>the price of the grain</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: <i>The cost of shipping grain</i>
 is high: on average, it is equal to <i>the price of the grain</i>
 transported, and in some places <i>it</i>
 exceeds <i>that price</i>
 .</p>
<p>[-Transportation charges = the cost of moving grain, so the second term was replaced by "it."</p>
<p>-The second reference to the price of grain was replaced with "that price."]</p>
<p>12) A: For this reason, we have decided to increase our <u>cotton</u>
 purchases both at home and abroad and to commission private <u>cotton</u>
 mills in Shanghai to produce more <u>cotton</u>
 fabric for us by using the <u>cotton</u>
 we offer them.</p>
<p>B: For this reason, we have decided to buy more <i>cotton</i>
 both at home and abroad and to commission privately owned mills in Shanghai to process <i>it</i>
 into cloth for us.</p>
<p>[-A little critical attention reveals that only the first of the four mentions of cotton is necessary.</p>
<p>-Mills that produce cotton fabric are obviously "cotton" mills; only "cotton" fabric can be produced from cotton; and "the cotton we offer them" is plainly the same as the cotton we are buying, which can now become "it."]</p>
<p>13) A: The target of the revolution is to change the old system, which hindered <u>the development of the productive forces</u>
 , and prepare new means for <u>the development of the productive forces</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: The goal of the revolution is to change the old system, which hindered <i>the development of the productive forces,</i>
 and to prepare new means for <i>their development</i>
 .</p>
<p>[-In principle, the entire second mention of "the development of the productive forces" could be replaced by the pronoun "it."</p>
<p>-That much tightening, however, would have left the meaning unclear, so the phrase was simply shortened with the help of the possessive pronoun "their."]</p>
<p>14) A: Asked whether he wanted to <u>own</u>
 a car, Xia said, "I've never even thought of <u>owning</u>
 a car. It's too expensive. No one in my factory is rich enough to <u>own</u>
 a car. Most of the people in the city who now <u>own</u>
 automobiles are <u>owners</u>
 of private businesses.</p>
<p>B: Asked whether he wanted to <i>own</i>
 a car, Xia said, "I've never even thought about <i>that.</i>
 It's too expensive. No one in my factory can afford to <i>own</i>
 a car. Most of the people in the city who <i>have</i>
 automobiles are <i>owners</i>
 of private businesses."</p>
<p>[-A short, commonplace word like "own" doesn't draw so much attention to itself as a longer, more unusual phrase like "development of the productive forces," so it can be repeated more often without intruding on the reader's consciousness.</p>
<p>-Even so, five appearances of any word in four short sentences must be considered excessive, and replacements ("that" and "have") were not hard to find.]</p>
<p>15) A: When the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, after careful consideration, issues an order to <u>transfer public grain</u>
 from one <u>province</u>
 to another, no <u>province</u>
 should refuse to <u>transfer its public grain</u>
 to meet the needs of other areas.</p>
<p>B: When the Ministry of Finance, after careful consideration, issues an order to <i>transfer public grain</i>
 from one <i>province</i>
 to another where it is needed, no <i>local authorities</i>
 may refuse to <i>do so.</i>
</p>
<p>[-The useful "do so" served to replace the second reference to transferring public grain.</p>
<p>-"Local authorities" was substituted for the second "province" partly to avoid repetition and partly to avoid personifying "province"—that is, to introduce some people to do the refusing.</p>
<p>-(Note that "to meet the needs of other areas" was tightened to "where it is needed.")</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : "Of the Central People's Government" is a superfluous modifier because, in any state, a ministry is always an organ of the central government. )]</p>
<p>16) <i>Footnote referring to the Ministry of Trade:</i>
</p>
<p>A: Established in October 1949, the Ministry of Trade under the Central People's Government was in charge of <u>domestic and foreign trade</u>
 . It was abolished in August 1952, when the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Foreign Trade were established to handle <u>domestic trade and trade with other countries</u>
 , respectively.</p>
<p>B: The Ministry of Trade was established in October 1949 to be in charge of <i>domestic and foreign trade.</i>
 It was abolished in August 1952, when <i>its functions</i>
 were divided between two new ministries, the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Foreign Trade.</p>
<p>[-It is self-evident that the Ministry of Foreign Trade will handle trade with other countries, and clear in context that the Ministry of Commerce will handle domestic trade.</p>
<p>-The sentence was recast to express the notion more succinctly and without the repetition.</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : Again, "under the Central People's Government" is understood. )]</p>
<p>17) A: In order to familiarize <u>the central Financial and Economic Commission</u>
 with <u>preparations</u>
 in the <u>various regions</u>
 and to ensure coordination in this effort, the <u>local authorities</u>
 should report to <u>the former</u>
 on their <u>preparatory work</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: To keep <i>the central Financial and Economic Commission</i>
 informed and to ensure coordination, <i>local authorities</i>
 should report to <i>the Commission</i>
 on the <i>preparations</i>
 they are making.</p>
<p>[-These repetitions too are unnec. "Preparatory work" = "preparations," "local authorities" represent the "various regions," and there is no need to refer to either notion twice.</p>
<p>-The Financial and Economic Commission was repeated, however, in shortened form, because in this sentence "the former" doesn't work.</p>
<p>-"The former" can be used only to refer to one of two preceding items—here, there would have to have been a mention of two different government bodies. In other words, we cannot speak of the "former" (= the first) unless there is also a "latter" (= the second).</p>
<p>-("In this effort" was deleted as self-evident. )]</p>
<p>18) A: One thing that has to be done is to establish a new international political order. The other is to establish <u>a new international economic order</u>
 . With regard to <u>a new international economic order</u>
 , I spent a long time on it when I spoke at the United Nations General Assembly in 1974.</p>
<p>B: One thing that has to be done is to establish a new international political order;the other is to establish <i>a new international economic order.</i>
 With regard to <i>the latter,</i>
 I spent a long time on the subject when I spoke at the United Nations General Assembly in 1974.</p>
<p>[Unlike in the preceding example, here there are two comparable items (the two "new international orders"). It is therefore possible to refer to the second of them as "the latter. ']</p>
<p>19) A: Xuzhou's strategy, says Xia, has been to build reliable and affordable <u>specialized vehicles</u>
 . Xia sees an expanding market in China for <u>specialized vehicles</u>
 . "Large automakers cannot possibly manufacture all kinds of <u>specialized vehicles</u>
 ," he says, "and those of us in <u>specialized vehicle</u>
 production have a niche in meeting the market demands."</p>
<p>B: Xuzhou's strategy, says Xia, has been to build reliable and affordable <i>specialized vehicles.</i>
 Xia sees an expanding market in China for <i>such vehicles</i>
 . "Large automakers cannot possibly manufacture all kinds of <i>specialized vehicles,</i>
 " he says, "and those of us who produce <i>them</i>
 have a niche in the market."</p>
<p>[-Four "specialized vehicles" in three successive sentences is distressing to the ear of a native speaker. It is easy enough, however, to reduce them to an acceptable two.</p>
<p>-At the second reference, the adjective "specialized" was replaced by "such."At the fourth, both adjective and noun were replaced by the pronoun "them."</p>
<p>-(Note that the primary meaning of "niche"—derived from the Latin word for "nest"—is a small recess in a wall. Metaphorically, it is a special place or position in some larger structure. Accordingly, one can speak of a "niche in the market" but not of a "niche in meeting demands.")]</p>
<p>20) <i>From a footnote referring to the "Joint Declaration of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Question of Hong Kong" :</i>
</p>
<p>A: <u>The Joint Declaration</u>
 states: "<u>The Government of the People's Republic of China</u>
 will resume exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong with effect from 1 July 1997, and the Government of the United Kingdom will restore Hong Kong to <u>the People's Republic of China</u>
 with effect from 1 July 1997."<u>The Government of the People's Republic of China</u>
 expounds in <u>the Joint Declaration</u>
 the basic policies of the <u>People's Republic of China</u>
 regarding Hong Kong.</p>
<p>B: <i>The Joint Declaration</i>
 states: "<i>The Government of the People's Republic of China</i>
 will resume exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong with effect from 1 July 1997, and the Government of the United Kingdom will restore Hong Kong to <i>the People's Republic of China</i>
 with effect from 1 July 1997."In <i>this document the Chinese government sets forth its</i>
 basic policies regarding Hong Kong.</p>
<p>[-Although "the People's Republic of China" occurs twice in the first sentence, there can be no question of abbreviating the title or replacing it with a pronoun because this is a direct quotation from the Joint Declaration and cannot be altered.</p>
<p>-In the second sentence, however, it is the editor of the book speaking, and there is no reason to continue in the same formal tone.</p>
<p>-Accordingly, "the Government of the People's Republic of China" can be reduced to "the Chinese government," and thereafter to a simple "its."</p>
<p>-And to avoid repetition, we can now use a general noun to refer to the Joint Declaration: "this document."]</p>
