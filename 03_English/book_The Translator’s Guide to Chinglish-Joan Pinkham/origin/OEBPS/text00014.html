<title>IX. The Placement of Phrases and Clauses</title>
</head>
<body style="font-family:cnepub,serif;">
<h2>IX. The Placement of Phrases and Clauses</h2>
<p>As you know from your study of the language, in English the changing grammatical function of certain words is represented by inflection—that is, by a change in form. The verb "read" becomes the noun "reader," the noun "blood" becomes the verb "bleed," the adjective "rapid" becomes the adverb "rapidly," and so on. We can tell at once what part of speech these words are.</p>
<p>But countless other words do not change in this way. "Plant" looks and sounds the same whether it is a noun or a verb, "clean" can be either a verb or an adjective, "daily" an adjective, an adverb, or a noun.</p>
<p>And even if we can tell from its inflection which general class a word belongs to, there may be no characteristic ending or vowel change to indicate how it is being used in a particular sentence.</p>
<p>"Student" is plainly a noun and could not be mistaken for any form of the verb "study."But there is no way to tell from its appearance or pronunciation how it relates to the words around it. Considered in isolation, it could be functioning as either the subject of a verb ("the student wrote a letter"), the direct object of a verb ("I addressed the student"), the indirect object of a verb ("I wrote the student a letter"), or the object of a preposition ("my letter to the student").</p>
<p>For this reason, the order in which words appear in English, like the order of Chinese characters, is of prime importance as an indicator of the relations between them and hence of meaning. This is especially true of the written language, which lacks the clues supplied by a situational context and by the speaker's voice.</p>
<p>Consider the following pairs. Within each pair the words are identical. It is only their order that tells us how they are related and consequently what the combination of words means:</p>
<p>-our forces overcame the enemy</p>
<p>the enemy overcame our forces</p>
<p>-many high cadres will attend the meeting</p>
<p>will many high cadres attend the meeting (?)</p>
<p>-an army private</p>
<p>a private army</p>
<p>-the achievement of this purpose</p>
<p>the purpose of this achievement</p>
<p>-we soon came to that conclusion too</p>
<p>we came to that conclusion too soon</p>
<p>Clearly, if translators wish to communicate ideas, even on the most elementary level, they must order their words carefully, respecting the conventions of the language.</p>
<p>For any student of English who has advanced to the point of attempting translation, the placement of individual words, as in these pairs, generally presents no problem. He or she automatically uses the order subject-verb-object in a declarative sentence and auxiliary-subject-verb in the interrogative, places an adjective before the noun it modifies, and so on.</p>
<p>The translator is often less certain, however, where to put groups of words, that is, phrases or clauses. The proper placement of these longer units is important for two reasons.</p>
<p>The first is that logical order serves to prevent misunderstanding. If a group of words is in the wrong place logically, it can be confusing or ambiguous. Worse, it can make a sentence convey something quite different from what the writer had in mind or even reduce it to an absurdity.</p>
<p>The second reason is that the order of phrases and clauses in a sentence shows which of them the writer wishes to emphasize. It indicates the relative importance attached to the various ideas and makes plain the logical connections between them. Arranging the parts of a sentence to provide the correct emphasis gives readers indispensable help as they try to follow a narrative, exposition, or argument.</p>
<p>In this chapter we shall look at some Chinglish sentences in which words have been poorly arranged, either from the point of view of logic or from the point of view of emphasis. Often, if the order is wrong logically, it provides the wrong emphasis as well. Nevertheless, these are essentially two different problems, and we shall consider them separately.</p>
<h3 id="c1">Correct word order for logic</h3>
<p>In this section we shall see how a phrase or clause that appears in the wrong place can mislead the reader as to the meaning of a sentence.</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Misplaced phrases</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>The kind of phrase most likely to cause trouble is one that serves as an adjective or adverb. Such a phrase is misplaced when it modifies, or appears to modify, some element in the sentence other than the one intended. For example:</p>
<p>A: In an article celebrating the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party <u>in 1949</u>
 , Mao Zedong said....</p>
<p>B: <i>In 1949,</i>
 in an article celebrating the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, Mao Zedong said....</p>
<p>[In A-version, the phrase "in 1949” modifies not "anniversary," as the writer clearly intended, but "founding," which is the closer word. Thus, the sentence says that the Party was founded in 1949. Moved to the beginning, the phrase modifies "said," which restores the correct meaning.]</p>
<p>A: over the past decades he has devoted the greater part of his life to <u>developing and spreading</u>
 improved orange strains <u>among fruit growers</u>
</p>
<p>B: over the past decades he has devoted the greater part of his life to <i>developing</i>
 improved orange strains <i>and spreading</i>
 them <i>among fruit growers</i>
</p>
<p>[-In A-version, the adverbial phrase "among fruit growers" modifies both the developing and spreading of the improved strains. But logically, one cannot develop oranges among growers. The revision separates "developing" from "spreading" and restricts the modifying phrase to "spreading."</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : The pronoun "them" was used to avoid a second reference to "improved orange strains.")]</p>
<p>A: Inside the grand Dacheng Palace in the middle of the Confucius Temple, musicians will play tunes allegedly refined by Confucius, <u>using antique instruments</u>
 including the stringed <i>guqin.</i>
</p>
<p>B: Inside the grand Dacheng Palace in the middle of the Confucius Temple, musicians <i>using antique instruments,</i>
 including the stringed <i>guqin,</i>
 will play tunes allegedly refined by Confucius.</p>
<p>["Using antique instruments" is plainly meant to modify "musicians," but in A-version its placement makes it modify the immediately preceding "Confucius."In B-version, the participle "using" is attached to the right noun, "musicians."]</p>
<p>A: <u>After years of effort</u>
 , Gao said that soil erosion has been brought under control in 16, 700 square kilometers of the affected land areas, or 58% of the total.</p>
<p>B: Gao said that <i>after years of effort,</i>
 soil erosion has been brought under control in 16, 700 square kilometers of the affected land area, or 58% of the total.</p>
<p>[In A-version, the introductory phrase modifies not "has been brought under control," but the principal verb, "said."This makes it appear that Gao spent years trying to speak. B-version establishes the logical connection between the parts of the sentence.]</p>
<p>It is true that readers who misinterpret sentences like these probably will not be deceived for long. They may even grasp the intended sense intuitively, without having to retrace their steps. But they will come to the right understanding in spite of, not because of, the words on the page. That their confusion may be only momentary does not relieve the translator of the obligation to write sentences which, when analyzed, actually say what they are supposed to mean.</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Misplaced clauses</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>Logically misplaced clauses are less frequent in Chinglish than misplaced phrases. When they do appear, however, it is usually for the same reason: the clause in question acts as a modifier, and the translator has inadvertently made it modify the wrong element in the sentence. Here are two examples:</p>
<p>A: So long as we strictly implement the Government Administration Council's Decision on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work, <u>after we go through several months of difficulties</u>
 , we have every reason to expect that the financial situation will gradually improve.</p>
<p>B: So long as we strictly implement the Government Administration Council's Decision on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work, we have every reason to expect that <i>after a few difficult months</i>
 the financial situation will gradually improve.</p>
<p>[-The clause "after we go through several months of difficulties," is intended to function as an adverb modifying "will improve."But in A-version, coming before "we have every reason to expect," it modifies those words instead.</p>
<p>-The principle is the same as in the last example above, about Gao and soil erosion. There too, the adverb ("after years of effort") modified the wrong verb, and for the same reason: the translator had placed it on the wrong side of the relative pronoun "that."</p>
<p>-(Once the word order was corrected, it became clear that the clause "after we go through several months of difficulties" could be reduced to a simple phrase, "after a few difficult months.")]</p>
<p>A: We should also review our experience frequently and make adjustments in light of the actual conditions <u>when we find problems</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: We should also review our experience frequently and, <i>when we find problems,</i>
 make adjustments in light of the conditions.</p>
<p>[-The subordinate clause is intended to modify "make adjustments" (i. e., make adjustments when we find problems). In A-version, however, it attaches itself to the immediately preceding "conditions" instead (i. e., make adjustments in light of the conditions that exist at the time we find the problems). The difference in sense is not great, but B-version is preferable for both clarity and rhythm.</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : "Actual" was dropped as a redundant intensifier. )]</p>
<p>Mistakes in logic like the ones we have been discussing can easily be corrected by a change of word order. The difficulty lies in recognizing them, but that is largely a matter of practice. When you reread your work, try to be on the alert for misplaced modifiers and make sure that what you have written means what you meant it to mean.</p>
<h3 id="c2">Word order for proper emphasis</h3>
<p>On the question of how to arrange material in an English sentence to achieve a desired emphasis, writers on style are in general agreement. Jacques Barzun speaks for them all when he says [p. 154] "the emphatic places in a sentence are beginning and end, the end being the more so."</p>
<p>For this reason, the most important element in the writer's thought, the one on which he or she wishes to focus the reader's attention, usually appears at the end of the sentence. The idea next in importance will probably come at the beginning, while any incidental details are relegated to the middle.</p>
<p>Strunk and White [p. 32] even formulate this as a general principle: "The proper place in the sentence for the word or group of words the writer desires to make most prominent is usually the end."</p>
<p>In this section we shall examine the practical applications of that principle as it affects the work of the translator.</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>A misplaced phrase</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>Consider the following versions of the same sentence:</p>
<p>-After more than twenty days of exhausting marches and heavy combat, they reached the Dabie Mountains <u>in late August</u>
 .</p>
<p>-They reached the Dabie Mountains in late August, <u>after more than twenty days of exhausting marches and heavy combat</u>
 .</p>
<p>-In late August, after more than twenty days of exhausting marches and heavy combat, <u>they reached the Dabie Mountains</u>
 .</p>
<p>The sentence consists of three basic elements: an independent clause (“<u>they reached</u>
 the Dabie Mountains”) and two prepositional phrases (“<u>after</u>
 more than twenty days etc."and "<u>in</u>
 late August”), both of which function as adverbs modifying the verb "reached."</p>
<p>The arrangement of these three elements makes no difference to the plain meaning of the sentence. Unlike the misplaced modifiers discussed above, the two prepositional phrases here can be placed virtually anywhere—there are even further possibilities—without offense to logic.</p>
<p>The difference between the three arrangements is one of emphasis: each highlights a different aspect of the event. To choose which version to adopt, the translator must decide which aspect should be given most prominence—in other words, which element should come last.</p>
<p>This sentence occurred in a historical account of the War of Liberation. When the polisher came upon it in a draft translation, she went back over the whole passage, because she knew it was not enough to look at a single sentence in isolation.</p>
<p>Earlier paragraphs in the text made it clear that the PLA's drive on the Dabie Mountains in the summer of 1947 was of great strategic importance and as daring as it was dangerous. Then came a paragraph describing the PLA troops' surprise crossing of the Yellow River, their annihilation of a large enemy (KMT) contingent, and their heroic 500-kilometer march south, during which they had to cross rivers and marshes, fighting all the way. The sentence under consideration came at the end of that paragraph.</p>
<p>Plainly, in this context the main point of the sentence was that despite all hazards, the revolutionary forces had finally reached their destination. The time of their arrival and even the ordeals they had been through on the way were of secondary importance. The arrival of the troops, therefore, should be accorded the place of honor at the end of the sentence.</p>
<p>In the draft the polisher had before her, however, that was not the case. The original translator had used instead the first version cited above:</p>
<p>-After more than twenty days of exhausting marches and heavy combat, they reached the Dabie Mountains <u>in late August</u>
 .</p>
<p>The polisher thought that in last position, the adverbial phrase "in late August" distracted readers by drawing attention to a relatively unimportant fact and, worse, came as an anticlimax undercutting the dramatic effect of the account. It was, in short, as plainly "misplaced" as if it had been modifying the wrong word. Accordingly, she moved the phrase up to precede the main clause:</p>
<p>-After more than twenty days of exhausting marches and heavy combat, <u>in late August</u>
 they reached the Dabie Mountains.</p>
<p>That version emphasized the central point. But now it seemed to give too little consequence to the date. This was, after all, a narration of historical events in chronological order, and dates were of some importance. Suppose the shorter phrase were put first:</p>
<p>- <u>In late August</u>
 , after more than twenty days of exhausting marches and heavy combat, they reached the Dabie Mountains.</p>
<p>At last, the polisher felt, the emphasis was right. The clause and the "August" phrase were in the positions of prominence, end and beginning, while the strong content and greater length of the "after" phrase ensured that it would not be lost in the middle.</p>
<p>As often happens, the right emphasis produced the right rhythm as well. Readers would be carried rapidly forward to the suspensefully delayed verb "reached," which would then come as the culmination of the sentence, just as it was the culmination of the events described. The form matched the content.</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>More misplaced phrases</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>Here are additional examples of phrases that are misplaced because they usurp the position normally reserved for the more important information:</p>
<p>A: The pro-Japanese Kuomintang group, headed by Wang Jingwei, vice-president of the KMT, chairman of the Central Political Council, vice-chairman of the Supreme National Defence Conference, and chairman of the People's Political Council of the Kuomintang, openly capitulated to the Japanese <u>in December 1938</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: <i>In December 1938,</i>
 the pro-Japanese Kuomintang group, headed by Wang Jingwei, vice-president of the KMT, chairman of the Central Political Council, vice-chairman of the Supreme National Defence Conference, and chairman of the People's Political Council of the Kuomintang, openly capitulated to the Japanese.</p>
<p>[The date is of secondary importance. The main point of the sentence is that the pro-Japanese group, headed by a man who held all these top-level positions in the KMT, capitulated to the Japanese. The whole sentence builds toward the dramatic predicate, "capitulated to the Japanese."Any detail that comes after that will inevitably seem incongruous, like a short tail on a large dog.]</p>
<p>A: It is estimated that our army will reach 5, 500, 000 <u>at its peak next year</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: It is estimated that <i>at its peak next year</i>
 our army will reach 5, 500, 000.</p>
<p>[The main clause here is less dramatic than in the preceding example, but it is still the one that deserves emphasis: our forces (at their peak) will reach this very large number.]</p>
<p>A: We have gained the initiative in Northern Manchuria <u>as a result of our work over the past eight months</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: <i>As a result of our work over the past eight months,</i>
 we have gained the initiative in Northern Manchuria.</p>
<p>[Never mind the modest self-congratulation, "as a result of our work."The important news is that we have finally gained the initiative in Northern Manchuria.]</p>
<p>A: Roughly speaking, the government will be in much better financial shape next year than this, <u>despite another enormous deficit</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: Roughly speaking, <i>despite another enormous deficit,</i>
 the government will be in much better financial shape next year than this.</p>
<p>[The fact to be emphasized here is not the negative one (there will again be an enormous deficit), but the positive one (we will be in much better shape).]</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Misplaced clauses</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>For phrases, as we have seen, the relative importance of each determines their proper placement. But it does not affect their wording. "In late August" and "despite another enormous deficit" remain unchanged whether they are emphasized or not.</p>
<p>For clauses, however, relative importance governs not only their placement but their form. As you know from studying English, if two ideas are of equal importance, they will be expressed as coordinate clauses, whereas if one is more important than the other, they will be cast as a main (or "independent") clause and a subordinate (or "dependent") clause.</p>
<p>Coordinate clauses will be joined by a conjunction like "and," "but," "or," "so," etc. A subordinate clause, which cannot stand alone, will be linked to the main clause by some connecting word like "which," "when," "although," "because," "if," "after," "until," etc., plainly indicating its dependent nature.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for translators, subordination is not so plainly marked in Chinese. Chinese tends to juxtapose phrases and clauses without any connecting words to indicate the relations between them. As Professor Cheng Zhenqiu has pointed out [p. 62], "the various parts of a Chinese sentence often appear to be coordinate with one another without any grammatical indication of their relative importance."As a consequence, he warns translators against following the Chinese mechanically and treating every phrase or clause as if they all had equal weight.</p>
<p>Thus, when confronted with any Chinese sentence composed of two or more clauses, you must decide whether they are coordinate and, if not, which is the main one. Once that question is answered, the further question of how to arrange the clauses for correct emphasis answers itself.</p>
<p>Logically, a subordinate clause should occupy a subordinate position in a sentence. And since, as we have seen, English normally reserves the final place for the most important idea, the subordinate clause should generally precede the main one.</p>
<p>The following sentences have been arranged in that pattern:</p>
<p>-But as we have often said, <u>although the road ahead is tortuous</u>
 , the future is bright.</p>
<p>-<u>As they marched</u>
 , the students shouted the slogans "Oppose hunger!" and "Oppose civil war!"</p>
<p>-It can be said that <u>ever since our two countries established diplomatic relations in the 1970s</u>
 , we have followed those principles to the letter.</p>
<p>-Then, <u>when they</u>
 [the skeptics] <u>saw that things were getting better in areas where the reform had been carried out</u>
 , they began to follow suit.</p>
<p>Try reversing the order of ideas in these examples:</p>
<p>-But as we have often said, the future is bright, <u>although the road ahead is tortuous</u>
 .</p>
<p>-The students shouted the slogans "Oppose hunger!" and "Oppose civil war!" <u>as they marched</u>
 .</p>
<p>-It can be said that we have followed those principles to the letter, <u>ever since our two countries established diplomatic relations in the 1970s</u>
 .</p>
<p>-Then they began to follow suit, <u>when they saw that things were getting better in areas where the reform had been carried out</u>
 .</p>
<p>As can be seen in each case, when the order is reversed the emphasis is shifted to the wrong part of the sentence. The result is as flat and disappointing as when the phrase "in late August" appeared at the end of "they reached the Dabie Mountains."</p>
<p>The chief point to remember is that when there is more than one possible arrangement of an English sentence—and except for the simplest utterances, there always is—you must make an important choice: which element is to be emphasized?</p>
<p>That choice will depend on the meaning of the Chinese passage and on the emphasis, explicit or implicit, that you perceive in it. Professor Cheng Zhenqiu stresses this point with italics when he writes [p. 64], "In translation, the important thing is... to determine which part of the sentence should, in accordance with the <i>meaning</i>
 of the original, be given prominence."</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>An added benefit of right emphasis</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>At the beginning of this chapter we noted that arranging the parts of a sentence to provide the desired emphasis has two virtues. First, as we have seen, it shows readers which idea the writer regards as most important. Second, it helps them follow the writer's line of thought. It is this secondary benefit that we shall consider briefly now.</p>
<p>When the elements of a sentence are presented in the right order for the desired emphasis, the readers' attention is directed to the core idea located at the end, the one that the writer is going to build on in the following sentence. The period that brings the sentence to a close gives them a pause during which they can absorb this idea. And since it is the one that has made the most recent impression on their minds, they are able to move on smoothly to the next sentence, following a logical progression of ideas.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, we must use longer examples showing how two or three sentences work together:</p>
<p>A: We used to serve the old society, <u>although we didn't work directly for the Northern Warlords or for the Kuomintang</u>
 . So we cannot say we were not influenced by the old society.</p>
<p>B: <i>Although we didn't work directly for the Northern Warlords or for the Kuomintang,</i>
 we used to serve the old society. So we cannot say we were not influenced by it.</p>
<p>[-In the revision, the subordinate clause ("although we didn't work directly etc.") comes first, leaving the position of greater prominence to the main clause ("we used to serve etc.").</p>
<p>-This change in order also provides a natural sequence of ideas. The end of the first sentence now leads directly into the second: we used to serve the old society, so we cannot say we were not influenced by it.]</p>
<p>A: Self-practice is important for all of them [students of foreign languages], <u>no matter whether they will take up the career of teachers or serve as foreign relations personnel</u>
 . Don't interfere with them when they manage to find time for self-practice.</p>
<p>B: <i>Whether they are going to go into teaching or work in foreign affairs,</i>
 it is important for all of them to practice by themselves. Don't interfere with them when they manage to find time to do it.</p>
<p>[-Again the subordinate clause has been moved up to subordinate position. And again, the last idea in the first sentence now prepares readers for the idea that will be presented in the next: it is important for them to practice, (so) don't interfere with them when they are practicing.</p>
<p>-(Note that "self-practice," unlike the similar "self-study," is not accepted English. )]</p>
<p>A: We are going through a period of war and enemy blockade. Nationwide victory, however, is now a foregone conclusion—and it will not be long in coming.... Of course, we should not close our eyes to the present situation, <u>just as we should not lose sight of the future</u>
 . At present, we have yet to wipe out the remaining enemy forces.</p>
<p>B: We are going through a period of war and enemy blockade. Nationwide victory, however, is now a foregone conclusion—and it will not be long in coming.... Of course, <i>although we should not lose sight of the future,</i>
 we should not close our eyes to the present situation either. We still have to wipe out the remaining enemy forces.</p>
<p>[-In the revision, the usual change of order has been made to draw attention to the main clause ("we should not close our eyes to the present situation").</p>
<p>-The result is the same as before: related ideas are brought together. The reference to the "present situation," now coming at the end of the sentence, is immediately followed by the statement of what, in the present situation, remains to be done ("We still have to wipe out etc."). In A-version, the reference to what must be done "at present" followed the unrelated statement that we should be mindful of the future.]</p>
<p>Thus we see in these three examples that correcting the word order of a given sentence to achieve proper emphasis also serves to achieve a logical connection between that sentence and the one that follows. This is very often the case, as will be demonstrated in many of the further examples below.</p>
<h3 id="c3">Twenty more examples of revision</h3>
<p>1) A: On November 12 and 25, 1947, the Federation of Comrades of the Three People's Principles, the KMT Association for Promoting Democracy, and the Democratic Revolutionary League, along with various democrats within the KMT, convened a Congress of Representatives of Democratic Factions of the Chinese Kuomintang <u>in Hong Kong</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: On November 12 and 25, 1947, <i>in Hong Kong,</i>
 the Federation of Comrades of the Three People's Principles, the KMT Association for Promoting Democracy, and the Democratic Revolutionary League, along with various (<i>or:</i>
 individual) democrats within the KMT, convened a Congress of Representatives of Democratic Factions of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>
<p>[-In A-version the phrase "in Hong Kong" attaches itself to "the Chinese Kuomintang," which immediately precedes it. Thus, the Congress appears to include only members of the Hong Kong branch of the KMT.</p>
<p>-In B-version the phrase indicating the location of the Congress has been moved up to the beginning where, like the one indicating the date, it properly modifies the verb "convened."(It could also have been placed directly after "convened.")</p>
<p>-This change also corrects the emphasis. After the long and impressive build-up to the Congress, the detail "in Hong Kong" would be anticlimactic.]</p>
<p>2) A: The election of Xiang Zhongfa as the principal leader of the Party was due to the influence of the Communist International, which put undue emphasis on the class status of a worker <u>in selecting cadres</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: The election of Xiang Zhongfa as the principal leader of the Party was due to the influence of the Communist International, which <i>in selecting cadres</i>
 put undue emphasis on the workers' class status.</p>
<p>[-In A-version the prepositional phrase appears to modify the preceding noun "worker," as if it were the worker who was selecting cadres.</p>
<p>-The revision places the phrase next to the verb it is supposed to modify, "put emphasis on."(It is also nearer to "the Communist International," which is doing the selecting. )</p>
<p>-This change also left the end of the sentence to the main idea.</p>
<p>-("Class status of a worker" was changed to "workers' class status" for reasons of logic. A-version appears to mean that the class status of anyone other than a worker would not be taken into consideration. The intended meaning is that the International emphasized "working-class status.”)</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : Because of the distracting repetition of sound—"due to" and "undue"—"undue" should have been changed to "too much.")]</p>
<p>3) A: Hong Kong could contribute to filling part of the gap in the mainland's financial infrastructure and assist China's drive to invigorate State-owned enterprises <u>with its mature financial market</u>
 , officials and experts agreed yesterday.</p>
<p>B: <i>With its mature financial market,</i>
 Hong Kong could help fill the gap in the mainland's financial infrastructure and assist in the drive to invigorate State-owned enterprises, officials and experts agreed yesterday.</p>
<p>[-A-version is misleading. At first, the "with" phrase seems to be attached to the immediately preceding "enterprises" : the reader thinks for a moment that it should be "with <u>their</u>
 mature financial market."But of course "its" must have a singular antecedent.</p>
<p>-Looking back, the reader finds "drive."But a drive cannot have a financial market. Then for a moment he or she tries to attach the market to "China's."Wrong again.</p>
<p>-The problem is that the "with" phrase is too far removed from the words it is logically attached to, "Hong Kong."</p>
<p>-This is easily remedied in B-version. There, the phrase has been put in the usual place for an adjective, directly before the word or words it modifies. (It could also have been placed directly after: "Hong Kong, with its mature financial market, could help etc.").</p>
<p>-Note that this example is an exception to the rules of emphasis we have discussed. The most important element in the sentence is clearly the clause telling how Hong Kong could help the mainland. That unnamed officials and experts agreed upon this is quite secondary. In principle, therefore, the sentence should have been rearranged to put the first clause last ("Officials and experts agreed yesterday that... .").</p>
<p>-But this sentence happened to be the lead in a newspaper story. For reasons that need not concern us here, in the matter of emphasis the practice of journalists is somewhat different from that of other writers, and for their purposes the order in A-version (important statement first, attribution last) was correct.</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : In the revision, "part of" the gap was dropped because it is redundant with "contribute" or "help.""China's" was eliminated as self-evident. )]</p>
<p>4) A: Unifying control over national financial and economic work will not only help overcome today's financial difficulties, but also create the necessary preconditions for economic development <u>without loss of time</u>
 in the days to come.</p>
<p>B: Unifying control over national financial and economic work will not only help us overcome our present financial difficulties, but will also create the conditions <i>that will enable us</i>
 to <i>move on quickly</i>
 to economic development.</p>
<p>[-Again, A-version is misleading. At first, the phrase "without loss of time" appears to be attached to the immediately preceding noun "development," suggesting that the development will be rapid. But "development without loss of time" is not English: the phrase is plainly adverbial and needs to modify a verb.</p>
<p>-Looking back to find a verb expressing some action that will take place "without loss of time," the reader lights on "create" : "will also create, without loss of time, the necessary preconditions... ."But that is not the right meaning either.</p>
<p>-The polisher of this sentence looked in vain for the word that "without loss of time" was supposed to modify. It was not on the page.</p>
<p>-Only by going back to the Chinese could he determine that the intended meaning was: "will also create the necessary preconditions that will enable us to <u>undertake</u>

<p>B: The SFCA (Sight First China Action) campaign, the chief purpose of which is to help Chinese cure or prevent cataracts, is being carried out by the Chinese Federation of Disabled Persons and the Ministry of Public Health, <i>with $15 million provided by the Lions Club International and some special government funds.</i>
</p>
<p>[-In A-version it is not clear what the prepositional phrase is supposed to modify. At first it seems to be attached to the preceding verbs "cure or prevent."But that is not logical: diseases are not cured or prevented by money but by the services and medicines that money can buy.</p>
<p>-Most probably, the phrase was intended to modify the "campaign."But it is so far removed from that word that without rereading the sentence carefully, no reader would make the connection.</p>
<p>-The polisher moved the floating phrase to the end of the sentence. In that position, it was securely and logically anchored to the preceding verb, "is being carried out."</p>
<p>-(“$15 million funded by" was changed to “$15 million provided by" for two reasons. First, for logic: it is not the money that is "funded" but the campaign. Second, for sound: "funded" and "funds" in the same phrase would make an annoying repetition like the ones we discussed in Chapter V. )</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : "Chinese people" was reduced to "Chinese," which means the same thing. In the title of the China Disabled Persons' Federation, the noun "China," used to modify "Federation," was changed to the adjective "Chinese."Then the relations between the words were clarified by the addition of an "of" : the "Chinese Federation of Disabled Persons.")]</p>

<p>B: It answered the fundamental question of how to turn a revolutionary army <i>that was</i>
 mainly composed of peasants and <i>operating in an environment of rural warfare</i>
 into a people's army of a new type. Never in the history of China had there been such an army.</p>
<p>[-In A-version the phrase "in an environment of rural warfare" attaches itself to the immediately preceding "new type."This suggests that the new type of army will operate in a new environment, which is not true.</p>
<p>-In B-version both phrases—"in an environment etc."and "composed of peasants"—have been placed in a subordinate clause beginning with "that," immediately following the words they modify, "a revolutionary army."</p>
<p>-The change in word order also allowed the most important element, "an army of a new type," to take its rightful place at the end of the sentence.</p>
<p>-As an added benefit of correcting the emphasis, the end of the sentence now led directly into the following one, which expanded on the idea of a new type of army.</p>
<p>-("Operating" was inserted for clarity and also to provide parallel structure with two participles—"composed of" and "operating in.")]</p>
<p>7) A: Don't assume that you no longer have the duty to think over the practicability of the reconstruction program <u>since it has been endorsed by the central authorities and approved by the State Planning Commission</u>

<p>B: Don't assume that <i>once the reconstruction program has been endorsed by the central authorities and approved by the State Planning Commission,</i>
 you no longer have the duty to think whether it is feasible. Very often our decisions are flawed or not well thought through.</p>
<p>[-In B-version the subordinate clause was moved up to a subordinate position in the sentence.</p>
<p>-Again, the last idea in the sentence now led directly into the next material. The notion that the program might or might not be feasible was followed by an admission that the central authorities often made mistakes. One idea led to the next in logical progression.</p>

<p>B: "Although the world is complaining about the adverse consequences of the greenhouse effect, the farmers of Heilongjiang seem to benefit from it," Ma said. The climate of the province is ideal for farming. <i>In the past seven years</i>
 there have been no low temperatures or early frosts, which usually do great harm to crops. This is largely thanks to the greenhouse effect.</p>
<p>[-In A-version, the adverbial phrase "in the past seven years" seems to modify the immediately preceding "do great harm to crops."In B-version it has been moved up to precede the words to which it is properly attached, "there have been no low temperatures or early frosts."</p>
<p>-So far as logic is concerned, the sentence could also have been revised to read: "Largely because of the greenhouse effect, in the last seven years there have been no low temperatures etc."But in this context it was important for correct emphasis to leave the "greenhouse effect" in the final position.</p>
<p>-("There have been no low temperatures and early frosts" was changed to "no low temperatures or early frosts," because the two phenomena do not necessarily go together. )]</p>
<p>9) <i>Headline of a newspaper advertisement:</i>

<p>B: Column <i>to be launched by China Daily's Advertising Department</i>
 will list latest rates of hotels receiving foreigners.</p>
<p>[-In A-version "to be launched" (intended as headline language for "is to be launched") appears to be a modifier attached to the immediately preceding noun. Unfortunately, that noun is not "column" but "visitors."</p>
<p>-The revision converts "to be launched" into a true modifier and places it directly after the correct noun, leaving the foreign guests safely on the ground.</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : To clarify the ambiguous noun-as-adjective construction, "China Daily" was changed into a possessive noun, "China Daily's."For the same reason, "Ad," which is normally an abbreviation for the noun "advertisement," was spelled out as the adjective "Advertising.""Foreign visitors" was shortened to "foreigners," because the reference to hotels made "visitors" self-evident. )]</p>
<p>10) A: This is because the national bourgeoisie adopted the neutral and sympathetic and even cooperative attitude toward revolution <u>during the period of the democratic revolution, especially during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation</u>

<p>B: This is because <i>during the period of the democratic revolution, especially during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation,</i>
 the national bourgeoisie took a neutral, sympathetic, or even cooperative attitude toward revolution, an attitude quite different from that of the landlord and bureaucrat-capitalist classes.</p>
<p>[-In A-version the subordinate phrase "during the period etc."follows the main idea (the attitude adopted) rather than preceding it and is thus misplaced for proper emphasis.</p>
<p>-Worse, the phrase comes between the first "attitude" and the second. The two words have identical meaning—the second is merely a repetition of the first, useful for the structure of the sentence—and logically, they must not be too far separated. But here the intervening phrase is so long that by the time readers reach the second "attitude," they have forgotten the first one to which it refers.</p>
<p>-In B-version, both problems were solved simply by moving the prepositional phrase forward in the sentence.</p>
<p>-(For reasons of logic, "neutral and sympathetic and even cooperative" was changed to "neutral, sympathetic, or even cooperative," since the same attitude could scarcely be all three at once. )]</p>
<p>11) A: <u>For more than a hundred years</u>
 , the Anti-Japanese War was the first complete victory won by the Chinese people <u>among the wars they waged to fight against the invasion by capitalist and imperialist countries for their national liberation</u>
 . For the first time in modern history, China, which had always been defeated in its resistance to armed foreign invasion, was able to avenge all the national humiliation since the 1840s.</p>
<p>B: <i>Of all the wars the Chinese people had fought over more than a hundred years for national liberation from capitalist and imperialist invaders,</i>
 this was the first that had ended in complete victory. For the first time in modern history, China, which had always been defeated in its resistance to armed foreign invasion, was able to avenge all the national humiliation since the 1840s.</p>
<p>[-Like the Dabie Mountains example discussed in the text, this is a sentence summing up historical events. The most important idea is clearly that this was the first complete victory, and in the B-version that idea is given the most prominent place, at the end.</p>
<p>-As in the Dabie Mountains sentence, the delayed central statement ("this was the first") heightens the suspense and provides a dramatic conclusion to a long narrative.</p>
<p>-By placing the "complete victory" at the end, B-version has the further advantage of preparing the reader for the next sentence, which is its natural continuation.</p>
<p>-("Invasion by capitalist and imperialist countries" was condensed to "capitalist and imperialist invaders.")</p>

<p>12) A: I once said that we should anticipate the necessity of blowing up the great dam at Sanmenxia <u>in case of an emergency, such as the occurrence of torrential rains, when the Sanmenxia reservoir, which is badly silted up, would overflow the Central China Plain and endanger the industrial areas around</u>

<p>B: I once said that in an emergency—<i>if, for example, there were torrential rains, and the Sanmenxia reservoir, which is badly silted up, threatened to overflow the Central China Plain, endangering the surrounding industrial areas</i>
 —it might be necessary to blow up the great dam at Sanmenxia.</p>
<p>[-After the dramatic statement that it might be necessary to blow up the great dam, the long speculation about the circumstances that would constitute an emergency is distinctly anticlimactic. Placed first, as in the revision, these subordinate ideas all build to the climax of the sentence, the delayed main clause.</p>

<p>B: I said this <i>not necessarily to urge you to blow up the dam</i>
 but to encourage you to think boldly.</p>
<p>[-Here too in A-version the emphasis is wrong. Clearly, what the speaker meant when he said something is more important than what he did <i>not</i>
 mean. Accordingly, it should come last.</p>
<p>-In B-version, the wrong interpretation of the remark is disavowed before the correct one is announced.</p>
<p>-Note that rearranging the preceding sentence (example 12) makes it logical to begin the present one with "I said this."The "this" is plainly meant to refer not to the description of the potential emergency, but to the words "it might be necessary to blow up the dam."In the revised version of example 12, those words appear at the end, where they will be immediately followed by "I said this."</p>

 : To reduce the incidence of the noun plague, "be bold in thinking" was changed to "think boldly," which was shorter, simpler and replaced a gerund with a verb. )]</p>
<p>14) A: We should look at the problem of language reform from the stand of 600 million people, <u>rather than from the individual habits and temporary convenience</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: We should look at the problem of language reform <i>not in the light of our individual habits and temporary convenience</i>
 but from the point of view of 600 million people.</p>
<p>[-The way we should "look at a problem" is clearly more important than the way we should <i>not</i>
 look at it. Thus, in the revision the wrong point of view is disposed of before the right one is introduced.</p>
<p>-The principle here is the same as in the preceding example: the positive statement is more important than the negative one and should therefore come last. (This principle generally applies to sentences on the pattern "I meant <u>not</u>
 this <u>but</u>
 that," "<u>instead of</u>
 doing this, they did that," "<u>rather than</u>
 rely on this, we should rely on that," and so on. )</p>
<p>-("From the stand" of 600 million people was changed to the more idiomatic "from the point of view."And since one cannot look at something "from" habits and convenience, or even "from the point of view" of habits and convenience, the phrase was changed to "in the light of.")</p>
<p>-("Our" was introduced to anchor the floating "habits" etc. to identifiable persons indicated by the subject "we" : "We should look at the problem... not in the light of our individual habits and temporary convenience but... .")]</p>
<p>15) A: We should set up additional state trading agencies and supply and marketing cooperatives, and organize private merchants to go into the mountains to establish commercial networks <u>so as to promote interflow of commodities</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: <i>To promote the exchange of commodities,</i>
 we should set up additional state trading agencies and supply and marketing cooperatives, and we should organize private merchants to go into the mountains and establish commercial networks.</p>
<p>[-The order in A-version is wrong for reasons of logic. The adverbial phrase is intended to explain the purpose of both measures—that is, it is supposed to modify both "set up" and "organize."Positioned at the end, however, it modifies neither of these, applying rather to the nearest preceding verb "establish."</p>
<p>-The order is also wrong for reasons of emphasis. It places a subordinate idea (<u>why</u>
 we should do these things) in the place that should be reserved for the principal idea (<u>what</u>
 we should do).</p>
<p>-Again, the simple solution to both problems was to move the phrase to the beginning of the sentence.]</p>
<p>16) A: The government should also help the missionary schools since they have great difficulty in funds <u>after severing relations with foreign countries</u>
 . The Ministry of Education should make it a point to solve the problems of private schools.</p>
<p>B: Missionary schools, <i>having severed relations with foreign countries, are in trouble financially, and the government should help them with their difficulties too. The Ministry of Education should make it a point to solve the problems of private schools.</i>
</p>
<p>[-Here there is nothing wrong with the word order in A-version from the point of view of logic. But again it places the subordinate idea (<u>why</u>
 the schools are in difficulty) in the place of emphasis that should be reserved for the main idea (<u>what</u>
 should be done about it).</p>
<p>-There are three ideas in this sentence. In order of descending importance, they are (a) that the government should help the missionary schools, (b) that the schools are in difficulty, (c) that the reason for this is that they have severed relations with foreign countries.</p>
<p>-The translator, no doubt following the Chinese, presented them in that order, inadvertently giving greatest prominence to the least important element, (c).</p>
<p>-The polisher remedied this by placing the central idea at the end of the sentence, the second most important at the beginning, and the least important in the middle. In other words, she followed the order: (b) the schools are in difficulty, (c) they are in difficulty for this reason, (a) the government should help them.</p>
<p>-This last notion then led smoothly to the next: "The Ministry of Education should... ."</p>
<p>-(The prepositional phrase "after severing relations" could be understood simply as an indication of the time sequence of events. To strengthen the notion that this was the <u>cause</u>
 of the schools' difficulties, the polisher tightened the connection between the two ideas, attaching them with a participle, "having severed.”)</p>

<p>17) A: Developing township and village enterprises is essential <u>for the countryside to become moderately prosperous</u>
 . We shall therefore continue to support such enterprises, especially in the central and western regions.</p>
<p>B: <i>If the countryside is to become moderately prosperous,</i>
 it is essential to develop township and village enterprises. We shall therefore continue to support such enterprises, especially in the central and western regions.</p>
<p>[-In A-version "for the countryside to become moderately prosperous" gives the reason for developing the township enterprises. But the point to be emphasized is that they must be developed, which should therefore come last. The principle is the same as in the two preceding examples: <u>why</u>
 before <u>what</u>
 .</p>
<p>-This consideration led to a change of order: "For the countryside to become moderately prosperous, developing township enterprises is essential."But since "For the countryside to become etc."seemed awkward, the polisher recast the idea as a subordinate clause, "If the countryside is to become etc."</p>
<p>-The change in word order, juxtaposing "township enterprises" at the end of the first sentence with "such enterprises" at the beginning of the next, made a tight logical connection between the two.</p>

 that organization can be considered consolidated. Only such an organization can fulfill the task assigned by the Central Committee:....</p>
<p>[-In the revision the conditions, expressed in a series of subordinate clauses, are all placed first, with the conclusion, expressed in the main clause, at the end.</p>
<p>-As usual, the change in order also creates a smooth transition from this sentence to the next: "such an organization" is plainly one that is "consolidated."</p>

<p>B: In response to Bai's hint—or perhaps under his influence—the KMT's Hubei Provincial Political Council and the governors of Henan and Hunan provinces recommended resumption of peace talks. <i>To that end,</i>
 they also demanded Chiang's resignation.</p>
<p>[-For proper emphasis, the prepositional phrase was moved up to precede the important main clause. This produced: "In the interest of peace talks, they also demanded Chiang's resignation."</p>
<p>-Again, the change of word order also established a logical connection—not with the next sentence, this time, but with the one before. The idea that these officials were promoting the "resumption of peace talks," which closed the preceding sentence, was now immediately picked up at the beginning of this one ("In the interest of peace talks, they also demanded.")</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : To avoid a second reference to "peace talks" immediately after the first, the polisher replaced the phrase "In the interest of peace talks" with the summary expression "To that end."In "the KMT Hubei Provincial Political Council," "the KMT"—a noun used as an adjective—was changed to a possessive noun, "the KMT's."Cf. the change from "China Daily" to "China Daily's" in example 9. )]</p>

<p>B: With these thoughts in mind, <i>on December 30, 1948,</i>
 Mao Zedong issued <i>through the Xinhua News Agency a New Year's message</i>
 that was a great call to carry the revolution through to the end.</p>
<p>[-By this time, you will no doubt recognize that the important element to be highlighted in this sentence is the "great call to carry the revolution through to the end."</p>
<p>-In A-version, however, the "great call" is lost in a clutter of circumstantial details. Consequently, its dramatic potential fizzles out like a defective New Year's firecracker.</p>
<p>-Also, because it is not clear what "in his New Year message" is meant to modify, it seems at first that the revolution is to be carried through to the end of Mao's message.</p>
<p>-By this time, you will also recognize that the solution to both problems is to recast the sentence in such a way as to place the great call at the end. That is what was done in B-version.</p>
<p>-There are no less than four subordinate prepositional phrases in this sentence: "with these thoughts in mind," "in his New Year's message," "through the Xinhua News Agency" and "on December 30, 1948."</p>
<p>-These four elements can be arranged in different ways, and the order that appeared in print was not necessarily the best. Other versions might be equally valid, so long as they give Mao's stirring "call" the place of honor at the end.]</p>

<p>7) In order to ensure achievement of the Party's political, military and economic objectives, Mao emphasized that the Party must first consolidate its ranks.</p>
<p>8) Our actions should be both beneficial to the national unity and suitable to local conditions, as stipulated in the Common Programme.</p>
<p>9) As the People's Liberation Army went over to the strategic offensive, the KMT authorities stepped up their oppression and exploitation of the people and their suppression of the patriotic democratic forces in an effort to maintain their tottering rule.</p>
<p>10) Should we be discouraged by these difficulties? No. We should recognize that our present difficulties are nothing very serious, compared to the difficulties we have faced over the last two decades of struggle.</p>
