<title>Part Three: Supplementary Examples</title>
</head>
<body style="font-family:cnepub,serif;">
<h1>Part Three: Supplementary Examples</h1>
<p>In Part Three you will find 40 additional examples of Chinglish that you can use to review all the material covered in this Guide.</p>
<p>Because it is both more important and more difficult to correct mistakes of sentence structure than to eliminate unnecessary words, these examples include more of the faults discussed in Part Two than those discussed in Part One. But each of the eleven major categories of problems we have considered is represented at least five or six times, and some of them—notably the eternal noun plague—a great many more.</p>
<p>Unlike most of the examples provided elsewhere in the book, these 40 are not sorted into separate categories and arranged by type or by degree of difficulty. That, of course, only reflects reality. In "real life," problems of translation do not appear in isolation or conveniently grouped in some logical way. On the contrary, they often present themselves in tangled clumps, and always in random order.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as we have seen, and as these examples will confirm, even a long and intimidating passage, full of intertwined problems, can be taken apart and reworked piece by piece.</p>
<p>You may wish to try your hand at editing these examples two or three at a time, and then to check your versions against the revisions provided at the end of the list. (As in chapters VI and XIII, the revisions are accompanied by detailed explanations describing the changes in chronological order. )</p>
<p>Most of the examples contain at least two or three errors, and a few as many as eight or nine. All told, there are some 150 trouble spots in want of attention. And as Jacques Barzun [p. 185] assures writers who are rereading their work, “[t]he sharper your judgment, the more trouble you will find."</p>
<p>It is equally true that the greater your patience, the more trouble you will find. The surest way to catch remaining elements of Chinglish in a translation is to read it over and over, and then, if possible, over again after a lapse of time that enables you to view it afresh.</p>
<p>In Professor Barzun's handbook <i>Simple and Direct</i>
 [p. 201], the last of 20 basic principles he sets forth for writers makes exactly this point: "Read and revise, reread and revise, keep reading and revising until your text seems adequate to your thought."That is, for translators, until your text seems adequate to your author's thought.</p>
<p>Do not be discouraged if, on comparing your version with the one provided, you find that you have not identified every problem and come up with the best solution for it. After all, many of these A-versions were selected precisely because they required extensive and difficult revision.</p>
<p>Remember too that revising is hard work even for native speakers of English. Like any other complex skill, it is acquired by degrees and largely through practice. No one ever mastered the craft of editing all at once—certainly not just by taking a course on the subject or by reading a book about it.</p>
<p>There is, however, one piece of practical advice, offered by Barzun and by many other experienced writers, that may prove helpful. It is that after you have "finished" a piece of work, you reread what you have written two or three times from different critical points of view, to see if it meets certain tests.</p>
<p>Addressing American writers, Barzun lists ten questions they should ask themselves about the text, including many relating to content and organization. For Chinese translators, who are not responsible for those aspects of a piece, we can propose a list of just three:</p>
<p>-First, is my version <u>clear</u>
 (no pronouns without plain antecedents, no misplaced or dangling modifiers, no expressions so vague or so highly condensed as to be incomprehensible)?</p>
<p>-Second, is my version <u>logical</u>
 (right emphasis, parallel structure where appropriate, logical connectives where needed)?</p>
<p>-Third, is my version as <u>tight</u>
 and as <u>light</u>
 as possible (no unnecessary or repetitive words and an absolute minimum of abstract nouns)?</p>
<p>If you can answer Yes to those three questions, you can be confident that you have turned Chinglish into English.</p>
<h3 id="c1">Forty final exercises</h3>
<p>1) It is an important political task of the Party during the transition period to continue to provide assistance to the intellectuals for their self-reform.</p>
<p>2) Our basic ideas, ranging from the development strategy to the principles and policies, including the policies of reform and opening to the outside world, are correct. If there is any inadequacy, it lies in the fact that the efforts we have made along the line of reform and opening are inadequate.</p>
<p>3) They [the KMT reactionaries] send or buy over traitors, who hide themselves in the Party, to spy on Party leaders and worm their way into leading Party organs, so that they can wipe out local Party organizations from top to bottom at one fell swoop when they give the order.</p>
<p>4) The most significant policy change is the ongoing process of shifting to national treatment for foreign investors in China from the practice of offering tax privileges and other preferential treatment to foreign investors, as in the first few years after the open policy was introduced.</p>
<p>5) The better you do your work and the more achievements you have, the better the people throughout the country will understand the value of knowledge, thus encouraging the people to respect and acquire knowledge.</p>
<p>6) In 1928 when the revolution was suffering serious setbacks, it was easy to see that the "Left" tendencies that appeared in the Party were wrong and to quickly put an end to putschist mistakes. But after the outbreak of the wars between the KMT warlords of different factions and at the time of apparent revival of the revolutionary movement, many comrades in the Party unrealistically overestimated revolutionary developments, giving rise to more intense and sustained growth of "Left" impetuosity.</p>
<p>7) The Party's Seventh National Congress was held two or three years after the rectification movement began which strengthened the unity of the Party and enabled our Party to achieve tremendous growth after Japan's surrender and to further demonstrate its strength during the War of Liberation.</p>
<p>8) Thus, the August 7th Meeting [of the Central Committee, in 1927] pointed out a new road for the CPC... making a great contribution to saving the Party and the revolution. It was the historic turning point from the failure of the Great Revolution to the rise of the agrarian revolutionary war. [<i>new paragraph</i>
 ] Owing to the "Left" ideas of the Communist International and its representatives and the "Left" tendency within the CPC, "Left" mistakes were not prevented while opposing Right mistakes at this meeting. On the contrary, adventurism and commandism were allowed and encouraged.</p>
<p>9) For example, if some of them who live in the cities with their families are not suited to work in the countryside, we should not force them to move, instead, allow them to remain in the cities.</p>
<p>10) The transfer of surplus labor force from rural areas to non-agricultural trades or its rational flow from one place to another is an objective requirement and inevitable trend of economic development.</p>
<p>11) In face of the butcher's policy of the reactionaries to kill all the revolutionaries, there was only one choice for the Communist Party of China: hold high the revolutionary banner and carry out armed resistance. Otherwise, it was like waiting for death and allowing the whole country to fall into darkness. The question remained: under such difficult conditions, how to continue to hold high the revolutionary banner and how to carry out armed resistance.</p>
<p>12) Finally, Party organizations at all levels in the anti-Japanese base areas and guerrilla zones should analyze their work on small guerrilla groups to learn how to coordinate their development with that of larger guerrilla units and the self-defense corps and what the relations should be among the three.</p>
<p>13) Third, the swollen organization of many private enterprises, their irrational methods of operation, their high costs and low profits or even losses, have also given rise to the phenomenon that many industrial and commercial enterprises are reducing their scale of business or even closing down.</p>
<p>14) By showing the injustice Xu suffers during the "cultural revolution," movie-goers are shown that women's status and dignity will continue to suffer as long as old-fashioned marriage and family concepts are kept.</p>
<p>15) We must do our best to mobilize the people if we want them to render assistance to the army wholeheartedly and ceaselessly; otherwise, such assistance will not be forthcoming. Only through immense efforts to get the masses organized can the Party widely motivate them to aid the army in the anti-Japanese base areas in North China today.</p>
<p>16) Upon their first entry into the country's heartland areas, they [the Manchus] had only a population of several hundred thousands. This figure rose to somewhere between four and five millions during the years when the Qing dynasty reached the apex in development.</p>
<p>17) Encouraged by new oil finds across the country, the long-term strategy for China's petrochemical industry is to double its crude oil processing capacity and chemical production by the end of the century to meet the rising domestic demand.</p>
<p>18) We must do our best to employ diversified means to use foreign funds to accelerate China's economic development....</p>
<p>19) The general calls issued by the Comintern were not in conformity with the realities of different countries, and it made concrete arrangements for various parties instead of giving them overall guidance, resulting in interfering with the internal affairs of various Communist parties....</p>
<p>20) Keeping a basic balance of international payments is an important condition for achieving sustained and smooth economic development.... Last year China's import increased considerably and its growth of export was relatively slow, thus resulting in a fairly huge trade deficit.</p>
<p>21) Revitalization and further development of agricultural production represents the central task in our current efforts to adjust the national economy.</p>
<p>22) Fourth, Ma discussed reform steps and measures. He said that China's reform has unprecedented and unique characteristics. Reform is carried out gradually in a planned and step-by-step way.</p>
<p>23) <i>From a paragraph dealing with the implementation of state capitalism in the early 1950s:</i>
</p>
<p>To the reactionary classes coercion must be applied and when dealing with matters within the ranks of the democratic classes, the principle of voluntariness must be observed, because it is a cooperative undertaking and cooperation admits of no coercion.</p>
<p>24) It is a major reform in our Party leadership system from the situation in which the responsibilities of the Party have not been separated from those of the government to that of the separating of the Party and the government.</p>
<p>25) Nationwide surprise inspections are expected to take place next month to ensure sanitary conditions in restaurants, unit canteens and roadside food stands. It is one of the activities that the Ministry of Health has scheduled to publicize the Food Hygiene Law in the first week of November.</p>
<p>26) As the simplification of Chinese characters is in the interest of the broad masses, we intellectuals should actively support it instead of taking a passive attitude toward it.</p>
<p>27) These four activities carried out by the Communist groups gave a powerful impetus to the dissemination of Marxism and to its integration with the workers' movement. Those intellectuals who had just fostered their belief in communism gradually had profound changes in their thinking and their feelings while they were integrating themselves with the workers; a number of workers had learned something about Marxism and raised their class consciousness, both becoming advanced elements of the proletariat.</p>
<p>28) We have to pay attention to lowering the average age of members of the leading bodies and selecting Marxists as leaders.</p>
<p>29) Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Michael Suen said at a luncheon yesterday that an independent Electoral Affairs Commission will be established, which will present plans on geographical constituency demarcation, voter registration and election procedures to the chief executive before the end of October.</p>
<p>30) The Leftist adventurism in this resolution [of the Political Bureau] found its expression first in the totally incorrect assessment of the situation, maintaining that the great decisive battle was just round the corner for both the Chinese and the world revolution. It wrote, "the fundamental political and economic crisis in China continues to sharpen in totally identical manner in each and every part of the country without the slightest essential difference."</p>
<p>31) It would be very difficult to accomplish the task of reclaiming as much as 140 million <i>mu</i>
 of land in a period of twelve years....</p>
<p>32) In March the same year [1920], Li Dazhao, after repeated consultations with Deng Zhongxia and others, set up at Beijing University a society for the study of Marxist theories. This was the first body established in China for learning and studying Marxism, the first attempt made by Li Dazhao to assemble "those who are interested in the study of theories of the Marxist school and those who are willing to study Marxist theories."</p>
<p>33) In order to build a new democratic country, the Congress put forth again the slogan of abolishing the Kuomintang one-party dictatorship and forming a democratic coalition government. It also expounded in detail the programs on such aspects as politics, economy and culture, which would be carried out in the new democratic country. In view of the fact that the Kuomintang ruling clique pursued policies of betraying our country, staging civil war and exercising dictatorship, the Congress called on the whole Party to be prepared for another eventuality, that is, the breakout of the civil war while striving for the establishment of a coalition government. If the KMT waged a civil war, the people would respond by waging a revolutionary war to overthrow the reactionary regime and build a new China.</p>
<p>34) We are working to build a great socialist community in which all nationalities will enjoy a thriving and affluent life....</p>
<p>35) A landslide caused 12 deaths in Lushui County, Yunnan Province, on Friday. <i>China Daily</i>
 learned yesterday that 13 others were missing and 11 houses still buried under the earth last Sunday. Heavy rain resulted in a 750-meter-wide, 300-meter-high mass of earth, with a volume of 60, 000 cubic meters, sliding about 20 meters downhill. The landslide damaged 182 households, affecting 1, 100 people. But a danger remains, as 1. 5 million cubic meters of earth are still moving, said the report.</p>
<p>36) This gradual transformation must be undertaken in a planned way and leadership exercised over that so that success will be assured when conditions are ripe.</p>
<p>37) <i>From a talk by a senior Party leader urging the necessity of separating the functions of the Party and the government and of delegating powers to lower levels:</i>
</p>
<p>We uphold the Party's leadership, but the problem is whether the Party is doing a good job of leading. It should give effective leadership and not intervene in too many matters. The Central Committee should take the lead in this regard. This is not meant to weaken the Party's leadership. Too much intervention and mishandling of things will actually weaken the Party's leadership.</p>
<p>38) That same day Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Peng Dehuai and other leaders of the Red Army cabled Chiang Kai-shek to indicate that the officers and men of the Red Army wished to "deal with the enemy for the purpose of defending the land and country and to save the life of the nation."</p>
<p>39) In doing economic work in 1992, we shall, under the guidance of the Party's basic line, step up the pace of reform, broaden the scope of opening to the outside, pay close attention to readjustment of the economic structure and improvement of efficiency, lay stress on improving agriculture and large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, and promote sustained, stable and harmonious development of the national economy.</p>
<p>40) The focus of work for this year is to exert efforts to resolutely overcome unhealthy practices and to push forward the building of clean and honest government.</p>
<h3 id="c2">Forty final revisions</h3>
<p>1) A: It is an important political task of the Party during the transition period to continue to <u>provide assistance</u>
 to the intellectuals for their <u>self-reform</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: One of the Party's important political tasks during the transition period is to continue <i>helping</i>
 intellectuals <i>reform themselves.</i>
</p>
<p>[-First, the polisher noted that "provide assistance to" was only the unnec. verb + noun form of "assist" or "help."She replaced it with the plain verb: "to continue to help intellectuals with their self-reform."Then, not liking the repeated "to" in "to continue to help," she substituted "to continue helping."</p>
<p>-To combat the noun plague, she changed "with their self-reform" to a construction with a verb instead: "reform themselves," which was more natural and easier to understand.</p>
<p>-(Note that a similar conversion from noun to verb often helps clarify or correct a "self-” compound, e. g. :</p>
<p>to enjoy self-management = to manage one's own affairs</p>
<p>to have time for self-practice = to have time to practice by yourself</p>
<p>because of self-pay tuition = because students must pay their own tuition. )]</p>
<p>2) A: Our basic ideas, ranging from the development strategy to the principles and policies, including the policies of <u>reform and opening</u>
 to the outside world, are correct. <u>If there is any inadequacy</u>
 , it <u>lies in the fact that</u>
 <u>the efforts we have made along the line of reform and opening</u>
 are <u>inadequate</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: Our basic ideas, from the development strategy to the principles and policies, including the policies of <i>reform and opening</i>
 to the outside, are correct. <i>If our efforts have fallen short in any respect, it is that we have not done enough to implement those policies.</i>
</p>
<p>[-The first thing that caught the polisher's eye was the useless expression "the fact that," so strongly condemned by Professor Strunk. She promptly edited it out: "If there is any inadequacy, it is that the efforts we have made... ."</p>
<p>-Her next thought was to get rid of the abstract noun "inadequacy," especially in view of the "inadequate" farther on. "If there is any inadequacy" became "if we have failed in any respect."</p>
<p>-This brought her to the end of the sentence: "the efforts we have made along the line of reform and opening are inadequate."She decided that was only a weak and wordy circumlocution for "we have not done enough to implement the reform and opening."</p>
<p>-The second sentence now read: "If we have failed in any respect, it is that we have not done enough to implement the reform and opening."</p>
<p>-Not bad by itself, she thought, but following the first sentence it presented an annoying repetition of "reform and opening."That could be easily remedied: she changed the second mention to "those policies."</p>
<p>-Rereading the new version, the polisher thought the word "failed" was perhaps too strong. She changed "if we have failed" to "if our efforts have fallen short."]</p>
<p>3) A: <u>They</u>
 send or buy over traitors, who hide themselves in the Party, to spy on Party leaders and worm <u>their</u>
 way into leading Party organs, so that <u>they</u>
 can wipe out local Party organizations from top to bottom at one fell swoop <u>when they give the order</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: <i>They</i>
 send <i>their</i>
 agents or bribe traitors to hide in the Party, spy on Party leaders, and infiltrate leading Party organs, so that <i>once they give the order,</i>
 the local Party organizations can be wiped out from top to bottom at one fell swoop.</p>
<p>[-It took the polisher two or three readings of A-version to recognize the cause of her confusion: the pronouns "they" and "their" were used in two different senses, and the antecedent kept changing.</p>
<p>-The first "They" represented the reactionary KMT; "their" and the following "they" referred to the traitors hiding in the Party; the final "they" again stood for those who employed the traitors.</p>
<p>-The polisher revised the sentence so as to use "they" and "their" consistently. In B-version the pronouns refer only to the KMT planners who "send agents," "bribe traitors" and "give the order" to wipe out CP branches.</p>
<p>-The polisher then noticed that the subordinate clause "when (once) they give the order" came at the end of the sentence as an anticlimax. To remedy this, she moved the clause up in the sentence, placing full emphasis on the devastating "wiped out from top to bottom at one fell swoop."</p>
<p>-(Note that for educated readers of English the expression "at one fell swoop"—a quotation from Shakespeare's play <i>Macbeth</i>
 —has a particularly chilling connotation of sudden, ruthless, politically motivated murder. In this context, the words are entirely appropriate, but they are sometimes wrongly used in Chinglish to mean simply "all at once" or "all of a sudden.")]</p>
<p>4) A: The most significant policy change is the <u>ongoing process of shifting</u>
 to <u>national treatment</u>
 for <u>foreign investors</u>
 in China from <u>the practice of</u>
 offering tax privileges and other preferential <u>treatment</u>
 to <u>foreign investors</u>
 , <u>as in the first few years after the open policy was introduced</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: The most significant policy change is the <i>gradual shift</i>
 from <i>offering foreign investors</i>
 tax privileges and other preferential <i>treatment, as in the first few years after the open policy was introduced,</i>
 to <i>treating them in the same way as Chinese nationals.</i>
</p>
<p>[-The polisher's first impression of A-version was that it was loose and wordy. She set about tightening it.</p>
<p>-"The practice of," being only a category noun, was the first candidate for elimination. "The process of" was likewise a category noun, so she changed "the ongoing process of shifting" to "the ongoing shift" and then to "the gradual shift."</p>
<p>-The double reference to "foreign investors" offered another opportunity for shortening: for the second mention she substituted the pronoun "them."</p>
<p>-The sentence on the page now was: "The most significant policy change is the gradual shift to national treatment for foreign investors in China from offering them tax privileges and other preferential treatment... ."But that was not a natural word order. Logically, a change is from x to y, not to y from x. Also, the more important idea, the new policy, should come last.</p>
<p>-The polisher reversed the order of the two phrases: "The most significant policy change is the gradual shift from offering tax privileges and other preferential treatment to foreign investors in China to national treatment for them, as in the first few years after the open policy was introduced."</p>
<p>-But that change clearly entailed another: "as in the first few years etc." now modified "national treatment for them" which made the wrong sense.</p>
<p>-To correct the logic she moved the phrase to the right place: "the gradual shift from offering foreign investors in China tax privileges and other preferential treatment, as in the first few years after the open policy was introduced, to national treatment for them."</p>
<p>-Now it was plain that parallel structure was wanted. The two elements in the comparison had to be of the same grammatical category, not "offering tax privileges" and "national treatment" (a gerund and a noun) but "offering tax privileges" and "giving national treatment" (two gerunds).</p>
<p>-These changes produced a new version: "The most significant policy change is the gradual shift from offering foreign investors in China tax privileges and other preferential treatment, as in the first few years after the open policy was introduced, to giving them national treatment."</p>
<p>-The sentence was now in good shape, clear and concise, but one thing still bothered the polisher: "national treatment."First, "treatment" was an abstract noun; second, it had just been used ("preferential treatment"); third and most important, it was hard to tell what "national treatment" meant.</p>
<p>-She abandoned the phrase and spelled out the meaning, being careful to use another gerund to match "offering" : "treating them in the same way as Chinese nationals."]</p>
<p>5) A: The better you <u>do your work</u>
 and the more <u>achievements you have</u>
 , the better the <u>people</u>
 throughout the country will understand the value of <u>knowledge</u>
 , thus <u>encouraging</u>
 the <u>people</u>
 to respect and acquire <u>knowledge</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: The better you <i>work</i>
 and the more you <i>achieve,</i>
 the better the <i>people</i>
 throughout the country will understand the value of <i>knowledge</i>
 and <i>the more they will be encouraged</i>
 to respect and acquire <i>it</i>
 .</p>
<p>[-The first thing the polisher noticed about A-version was the dangling participle. Having been given no noun to modify, "encouraging" attached itself to the subject of its clause.</p>
<p>-The principle was the same as if the participle had come before the subject instead of after: "Encouraging the people to respect and acquire knowledge, the people throughout the country will understand etc."Thus, "the people" appeared to be encouraging themselves to respect knowledge.</p>
<p>-To solve this problem, the polisher converted the participial phrase into a separate clause: "and thus the people will be encouraged to respect and acquire knowledge."</p>
<p>-Then, to avoid repeating nouns that had just been used, she immediately substituted "they" for "the people" and "it" for "knowledge."</p>
<p>-The sentence now read as follows: "The better you do your work and the more achievements you have, the better the people throughout the country will understand the value of knowledge, and thus they will be encouraged to respect and acquire it."</p>
<p>-The polisher saw that she could enhance the parallel structure by repeating in the second half of the sentence the pattern of the first: "the better x and the more y, the better x and the more y."Accordingly, she changed the last clause to read "and the more they will be encouraged to respect and acquire it." That version reinforced the logic and satisfied the ear.</p>
<p>-As final improvements, she reduced the two unnec. verb + noun constructions to plain verbs. "The better you do your work" became "The better you work," and "the more achievements you have" became "the more you achieve."These changes not only tightened the sentence but also heightened the parallelism.]</p>
<p>6) A: In 1928 when the revolution was <u>suffering serious setbacks</u>
 , it was easy to see that the "Left" tendencies that appeared in the Party were wrong and to quickly put an end to putschist mistakes. But <u>after the outbreak of the wars</u>
 between the KMT warlords of different factions and <u>at the time of apparent revival</u>
 of the revolutionary movement, many comrades in the Party <u>unrealistically</u>
 overestimated revolutionary developments, <u>giving rise</u>
 to more intense and sustained growth of "Left" impetuosity.</p>
<p>B: In 1928, when the revolution was <i>suffering grave setbacks,</i>
 it had been easy to see that the "Left" tendencies in the Party were wrong and to quickly put an end to putschist mistakes. But <i>at this time, when the KMT warlords</i>
 of different factions <i>were fighting</i>
 among themselves, <i>and when the revolutionary movement appeared to be reviving, many Party members overestimated revolutionary developments, and this fostered</i>
 a more intense and sustained growth of "Left" impetuosity.</p>
<p>[-This passage compared Party members' understanding of the revolutionary situation in 1928 and in 1930. The polisher saw that the contrast between the two attitudes would be clearer and stronger if the two sentences had parallel structure.</p>
<p>-To achieve this, she changed the pattern of the second sentence to match that of the first.</p>
<p>-First she introduced "at this time" (i. e., in 1930) to balance "In 1928." Then she changed the prepositional phrases "after the outbreak of the wars" and "at the time of apparent revival" to subordinate clauses ("when the KMT warlords were fighting" and "when the revolutionary movement appeared to be reviving") to match the subordinate clause of the first sentence ("when the revolution was suffering").</p>
<p>-(Note that these latter changes would have been desirable in any event because they replaced abstract nouns with verbs. )</p>
<p>-Proceeding with the second sentence, the polisher came upon another structural difficulty: "giving rise to" was a dangling participle. It was not the "comrades," the subject of the clause, who gave rise to the growth of "impetuosity" but their overestimate of revolutionary developments.</p>
<p>-To correct this error, she converted the participial phrase into a separate clause: "and this gave rise to."Then she thought of a more appropriate word: "fostered."</p>
<p>-Rereading her new version, the polisher made two more minor improvements. In the first sentence, to avoid the obtrusive repetition of "s" sounds in "suffered serious setbacks," she changed "serious" to "grave."In the second, she deleted "unrealistically" as redundant, since an "overestimate" is unrealistic by definition.]</p>
<p>7) A: The <u>Party</u>
 's Seventh National Congress was held <u>two or three years after the rectification movement began</u>
 <u>which</u>
 strengthened the unity of the <u>Party</u>
 and enabled our <u>Party</u>
 to achieve tremendous growth after Japan's surrender and to further demonstrate its strength during the War of Liberation.</p>
<p>B: <i>Two or three years after the rectification movement began,</i>
 the <i>Party</i>
 held its Seventh National Congress. <i>That</i>
 strengthened the unity of the <i>Party</i>
 and enabled <i>it</i>
 to achieve tremendous growth after Japan's surrender and to further demonstrate its strength during the War of Liberation.</p>
<p>[-First noticing the three references to the "Party," the polisher replaced the third with the pronoun "it."</p>
<p>-She then studied the relative pronoun "which."Apparently it was meant to refer to the whole idea just expressed: "The Party's Seventh National Congress was held."But the long intervening modifier ("two or three years after the rectification movement began") separated the pronoun from its intended antecedent and—especially in the absence of a comma after "began"—tempted it to attach itself instead to the nearby "rectification movement."</p>
<p>-To bring the pronoun nearer its antecedent, the polisher moved the subordinate phrase up to the beginning: "Two or three years after the rectification movement began, the Party's Seventh National Congress was held, which strengthened the unity of the Party etc."That also served to correct the emphasis.</p>
<p>-Then she recast the verb in active voice: "the Party held its Seventh National Congress."</p>
<p>-The "which" now had a clear antecedent, but it still made a very long sentence. The polisher discarded it, broke the sentence in two and made a fresh start with the demonstrative pronoun "That."</p>
<p>-Located at the end of the first sentence, the statement that the Congress was held now led directly into the second and provided a plainly recognizable antecedent for "That."]</p>
<p>8) A: Thus, the August 7th Meeting pointed out a new road for the CPC... making a great contribution to saving the Party and the revolution. It was the historic turning point from the failure of the Great Revolution to the rise of the agrarian revolutionary war. <i>[new paragraph]</i>
 Owing to the "Left" ideas of the Communist International and its representatives and the "Left" tendency within the CPC, "<u>Left" mistakes were not prevented</u>
 <u>while opposing Right mistakes</u>
 at this meeting. On the contrary, adventurism and commandism were allowed and encouraged.</p>
<p>B: Thus, the August 7th Meeting pointed out a new road for the CPC... making a great contribution to saving the Party and the revolution. It was the historic turning point from the failure of the Great Revolution to the rise of the agrarian revolutionary war. <i>[new paragraph] Nevertheless,</i>
 owing to the "Left" ideas of the Communist International and its representatives and to the "Left" tendency within the CPC, <i>although the Central Committee criticized Right mistakes</i>
 at this meeting, <i>it did nothing to prevent "Left" mistakes.</i>
 On the contrary, adventurism and commandism were allowed and <i>even</i>
 encouraged.</p>
<p>[-Even though there was a paragraph break after the remarks in praise of the August 7th Meeting, the polisher was well into the next sentence before she realized that it was critical of the meeting.</p>
<p>-To signal to the reader that the new material would contrast with what had preceded, she introduced a "Nevertheless" at the beginning of the paragraph.</p>
<p>-The remainder of the sentence posed several problems. First the polisher dealt with the dangling participle, "opposing," which had no subject to modify. She gave it one: "The Central Committee did not prevent 'Left' mistakes, while opposing Right mistakes at this meeting."</p>
<p>-She then became aware that the order of ideas was wrong: the point to be underlined here was not what the Central Committee had done but what it had failed to do. To correct the emphasis, she reversed the two clauses: "While opposing Right mistakes at this meeting, the Central Committee did not prevent 'Left' mistakes."</p>
<p>-Having made these modifications, she reread her version: "Nevertheless, owing to the 'Left' ideas of the Communist International and its representatives and to the 'Left' tendency within the CPC, while opposing Right mistakes at this meeting, the Central Committee did not prevent 'Left' mistakes."</p>
<p>-She was troubled by the awkward sequence of two participial phrases ("owing to..., while opposing . . ."). In particular, she was reluctant to burden the reader with such long modifiers before the subject of the sentence ("the Central Committee") was even announced.</p>
<p>-Accordingly, she decided to drop the second participle, "opposing," even though it was now correctly attached. The result was: “... while the Central Committee opposed Right mistakes at this meeting, it did not prevent 'Left' mistakes."</p>
<p>-Now that the sentence structure was satisfactory, she took a closer look at the wording. Considering that "opposed" was not quite right with "mistakes," she changed it to "criticized."And wishing to strengthen "did not prevent," she changed it to "did nothing to prevent."</p>
<p>-Then, as a concession to the strict grammarians who recommended that "while" be used only to indicate a relation of time, she replaced it with "although."</p>
<p>-When the polisher read the next sentence, she felt that something was lacking. The point was that adventurism and commandism were not only tolerated but, worse, encouraged. However, the notion that "encouraging" was a more serious mistake than "allowing" was only implied. She expressed it by adding "even"—again, a question of making logical connections plain.]</p>
<p>9) A: For example, if some of them who live in the cities with their families are not suited to work in the countryside, <u>we should not force them to move</u>
 , <u>instead, allow them to remain</u>
 in the cities.</p>
<p>B: For example, if some of them who live with their families in the cities are not suited to work in the countryside, <i>we should allow them to remain</i>
 in the cities.</p>
<p>[-A-version was a simple example of saying the same thing twice in the mirror-image form (we should not do this; instead, we should do the opposite). Plainly, if we should not force them to move, we should allow them to remain. The polisher saw no reason to retain both statements.</p>
<p>-She tried dropping the second statement of the idea. This produced: "For example, if some of them... are not suited to work in the countryside, we should not force them to move."</p>
<p>-But a second polisher pointed out that this might mean "we should not force them to move but only try to persuade them."To avoid any ambiguity, they decided to drop the first statement instead: "For example, if some of them... are not suited to work in the countryside, we should allow them to remain in the cities."]</p>
<p>10) A: The <u>transfer</u>
 of surplus labor <u>force</u>
 from rural <u>areas</u>
 to non-agricultural <u>trades</u>
 <u>or</u>
 its rational <u>flow</u>
 from one place to another <u>is an objective requirement and inevitable trend</u>
 of economic development.</p>
<p>B: <i>It is an objective requirement and inevitable trend</i>
 of economic development for surplus labor to <i>transfer</i>
 from <i>farming</i>
 to non-agricultural <i>occupations and</i>
 to <i>move</i>
 from one place to another in a rational manner.</p>
<p>[-On reading A-version the polisher was aware of the heavy weight of abstract nouns and modifiers at the end: "an objective requirement and inevitable trend of economic development."There seemed to be no other way of expressing that idea, but perhaps she could lighten the rest of the sentence.</p>
<p>-To change the nouns "transfer" and "flow" to verbs, she changed the order of ideas: "It is an objective requirement and inevitable trend... for surplus labor force to transfer... or to flow... ."This new structure also improved the emphasis, drawing attention to the two key verbs, "transfer" and "flow."</p>
<p>-The polisher then saw that she could dispense with a third noun, "force.""Surplus labor force" meant nothing more than "surplus labor," so "force" could be deleted as redundant.</p>
<p>-The sentence was now easier to understand, but it still did not seem logical. For one thing, the surplus labor was transferring from "rural areas" to "non-agricultural trades," two terms that were not comparable (places and occupations). To make them parallel, the polisher changed them to "farming" and "non-agricultural occupations."</p>
<p>-Another illogical element was the conjunction "or."Since the second term was not an alternative to the first but a supplement to it, the connection wanted was not "or" but "and."She made that change too.</p>
<p>-Lastly, feeling vaguely uncomfortable about the metaphor "flow" modified by "in a rational manner," she substituted the straightforward "move."]</p>
<p>11) A: In face of the <u>butcher's</u>
 policy of the reactionaries <u>to kill</u>
 all the revolutionaries, there was only one choice for the <u>Communist Party of China</u>
 : <u>hold high the revolutionary banner and carry out armed resistance</u>
 . <u>Otherwise, it was like waiting for death and allowing the whole country to fall into darkness</u>
 . The question remained: under such difficult conditions, <u>how to continue to hold high the revolutionary banner and how to carry out armed resistance</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: Faced with the reactionaries' policy of <i>butchering</i>
 all revolutionaries, the <i>Communists</i>
 had only one choice. <i>If they were not simply to wait for death and allow the whole country to be plunged into darkness,</i>
 they must <i>hold high the revolutionary banner and carry out armed resistance. But</i>
 the question remained: under such difficult conditions, <i>how was that to be done?</i>
</p>
<p>[-First, to tighten the first sentence the polisher combined the "butcher's policy" and "to kill"—essentially a double reference to the same idea—into a single word: "the reactionaries' policy of butchering."</p>
<p>-Next she considered the second sentence. If the "Otherwise it was like" had been not a new sentence following a period but a subordinate clause following a semicolon, she would have unhesitatingly moved it up to precede the main point, that the Party must "hold high the revolutionary banner and carry out armed resistance."</p>
<p>-Seeing that that would be an improvement, and judging that in this instance the punctuation in A-version made no difference, she combined the two clauses into one sentence and changed their order.</p>
<p>-This produced: "... there was only one choice for the Communist Party of China. If it was not simply to wait for death and allow the whole country to be plunged into darkness, it must hold high the revolutionary banner and carry out armed resistance."</p>
<p>-That was stronger and more dramatic, and it emphasized what the Party had to do, not what would happen "otherwise."Also, the end of this sentence now led directly into the question posed in the next: how could the Party hold high etc.</p>
<p>-A logical connective was needed, however, to warn the reader that what followed would be in opposition to what had just been said. The polisher inserted "But" to signal that a problem was about to be stated.</p>
<p>-Reaching the end of the sentence, she found "hold high the revolutionary banner" and "carry out armed resistance" again. To avoid the repetition, she replaced both terms with a simple demonstrative pronoun: "how was that to be done?" ("Continue to" seemed unnecessary in context and was simply dropped. ) Along with the other revisions, this tightening reduced the length of A-version by 20%.</p>
<p>-Rereading the new version, the polisher thought of one more small improvement. To introduce some concrete actors, she replaced "the Communist Party of China" with "the Communists."That version presented to the reader's imagination not an impersonal abstraction (the "Party" or "it") but real people (the "Communists" or "they") who had to choose between waiting for death and taking up arms to combat repression.</p>
<p>-(With regard to the expression "hold high the revolutionary banner," note that normal English word order would place the object directly after the verb: "hold the revolutionary banner high."However, because the given word order has a certain poetic ring, and because it has been consecrated by long usage, it was allowed to stand. )]</p>
<p>12) A: Finally, Party organizations at all levels in the anti-Japanese base areas and guerrilla zones should analyze <u>their</u>
 work on small guerrilla groups to learn <u>how to coordinate</u>
 <u>their</u>
 development with that of larger guerrilla units and the self-defense corps and <u>what the relations should be</u>
 among the three.</p>
<p>B: Finally, Party organizations at all levels in the anti-Japanese base areas and the guerrilla zones should analyze <i>their</i>
 work in relation to small guerrilla groups. <i>They should consider how to coordinate</i>
 the development <i>of such groups</i>
 with that of larger guerrilla units and of the self-defense corps and <i>how to establish</i>
 correct relations among the three.</p>
<p>[-The polisher had to read A-version twice before she understood that the pronoun "their" had two different antecedents. The first time it represented "Party organizations" ; the second time it stood for "small guerrilla groups."She solved this problem by substituting "of such groups" for the second "their."</p>
<p>-Then, since the sentence contained too many ideas to be absorbed without a pause, she broke it in two and started over with the pronoun "They."This "They," like the preceding "their," clearly stood for "Party organizations."</p>
<p>-The skeleton of the second sentence now read: "They should consider how to coordinate the development... and what the relations should be... ."The statement was clear and correct, but the polisher saw that it could be strengthened and clarified by parallel structure.</p>
<p>-She therefore changed the second element to match the first: "They should consider how to coordinate the development... and how to establish correct relations... ."]</p>
<p>13) A: Third, the <u>swollen organization</u>
 of <u>many private enterprises</u>
 , their irrational methods of operation, their high costs and low profits or even losses, <u>have also given rise to the phenomenon</u>
 that <u>many industrial and commercial enterprises</u>
 are <u>reducing their scale of business</u>
 or even closing down.</p>
<p>B: Third, <i>because of overstaffing,</i>
 irrational methods of operation, high costs, and low profits or even losses, <i>many privately owned factories and stores</i>
 are <i>having to cut back their business</i>
 or even close down.</p>
<p>[-The first thing that struck the polisher on reading A-version was the wordy and awkward construction that was the heart of the sentence: "x, y, and z have also given rise to the phenomenon that many... enterprises etc."</p>
<p>-Her first act was to jettison "give rise to" in favor of a simpler construction with "because" : "because of x, y, and z, many... enterprises etc."</p>
<p>-This produced: "because of the swollen organization of many private enterprises, their irrational methods of operation, their high costs and low profits or even losses, many industrial and commercial enterprises are reducing etc."That was distinctly better than giving rise to the "phenomenon" that something was happening.</p>
<p>-Next the polisher became aware of the two references to "enterprises."Clearly, the "many private enterprises" with the swollen organization etc. were the same as the "many industrial and commercial enterprises" that were reducing their scale of business. There was no necessity for both, so she eliminated the first mention.</p>
<p>-Then, to retain the sense of "private," which had disappeared along with the first "enterprises," she reinstated it with the second mention: "many privately owned industrial and commercial enterprises."(Thanks chiefly to these two major revisions, B-version turned out to be some 30% shorter than A-version. )</p>
<p>-Satisfied with the structure of the sentence, the polisher looked more closely at the wording.</p>
<p>-"Swollen organization," she thought, was a somewhat dubious metaphor for plain "overstaffing," which she used instead. "Industrial and commercial enterprises" could be simplified to everyday "factories and stores."And "reducing their scale of business" was just the noun-style version of "cutting back their business."</p>
<p>-Lastly, she decided the meaning would be clearer if for "are cutting back their business or even closing down" she substituted "are having to cut back their business or even close down."]</p>
<p>14) A: <u>By showing</u>
 the injustice <u>Xu suffers</u>
 during the "cultural revolution," <u>movie-goers are shown</u>
 that women's status and dignity will continue to <u>suffer</u>
 as long as <u>old-fashioned marriage and family concepts are kept</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: By showing <i>the injustice</i>
 to which Xu is <i>subjected</i>
 during the "cultural revolution," <i>the film demonstrates</i>
 that women's status and dignity will continue to <i>suffer</i>
 as long as <i>people cling to old-fashioned concepts of marriage and the family.</i>
</p>
<p>[-When the polisher looked for the subject of "showing" at the head of the main clause in A-version, she found only "movie-goers”—the people who were "shown" the injustice and plainly could not be "showing" it.</p>
<p>-She therefore made "the film" the subject of the sentence, matching the implied subject of the introductory gerund. This change not only corrected a dangling modifier but also had the advantage of changing passive voice (“movie-goers are shown”) to active ("the film shows").</p>
<p>-To continue in active voice, she also changed "as long as old-fashioned marriage and family concepts are kept" to "as long as people cling to old-fashioned marriage and family concepts."</p>
<p>-Then, not liking the two nouns used as adjectives in this last phrase, she broke up the sequence with a preposition: "old-fashioned concepts of marriage and the family."</p>
<p>-The revision now stood as follows: "By showing the injustice Xu suffers during the 'cultural revolution, ' the film shows that women's status and dignity will continue to suffer as long as people cling to... ."The structure of the sentence was satisfactory, but the polisher was bothered by the repetitions "showing" / "shows" and "suffers" /"suffer."</p>
<p>-To vary the sound, she changed "the film shows" to "the film demonstrates" and "the injustice Xu suffers" to "the injustice to which Xu is subjected."]</p>
<p>15) A: <u>We must do our best to mobilize the people if we want them to render assistance to the army</u>
 wholeheartedly and ceaselessly; <u>otherwise, such assistance will not be forthcoming</u>
 . <u>Only through immense efforts to get the masses organized can the Party widely motivate them to aid the army</u>
 in the anti-Japanese base areas in North China today.</p>
<p>B: <i>If we want the people to give the army their</i>
 wholehearted <i>assistance,</i>
 and to keep on giving it, <i>we have to mobilize them. We must make every effort to organize the masses: that is the only way to secure their help</i>
 in the anti-Japanese base areas in North China today.</p>
<p>[-After rereading this passage several times, the polisher realized that in essence it said the same thing not twice but three times: (1) we must mobilize the people if we want them to help us; (2) otherwise, they will not help us; (3) only if we organize them will they be willing to help us.</p>
<p>-She decided to retain the first and third statements of the idea for emphasis, but to drop the second (the mirror-image "otherwise such assistance will not be forthcoming").</p>
<p>-First she rewrote the first statement, making it a separate sentence and ending with the main point. This produced: "If we want the people to give the army their wholehearted assistance and to keep on giving it, we must do our best to mobilize them."</p>
<p>-Then she considered the third statement: "Only through immense efforts to get the masses organized can the Party widely motivate them to aid the army."She wanted to tighten it and also to make it less repetitive of the first sentence.</p>
<p>-After some false starts, she rearranged and varied the elements: "We must make every effort to organize the masses: that is the only way to secure their help."</p>
<p>-Rereading the two new sentences, she saw that "we must do our best to mobilize them" at the end of the first was now immediately followed by "We must make every effort to organize the masses" at the beginning of the second.</p>
<p>-In this context, "do our best" was not just an empty cliché, but thinking that the idea was adequately conveyed in "make every effort," she decided to omit it anyway. The end of the first sentence thus became simply "we have to mobilize them."]</p>
<p>16) A: <u>Upon their first entry</u>
 into the country's heartland <u>areas</u>
 , they [the Manchus] <u>had only a population of</u>
 several hundred thousands. This <u>figure</u>
 rose to somewhere between four and five millions <u>during the years when the Qing dynasty reached the apex in development</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: <i>When they first entered</i>
 the heartland of China, they <i>numbered only</i>
 a few hundred thousand. <i>But during the years when the Qing dynasty was at its height,</i>
 their <i>population</i>
 rose to between four and five million.</p>
<p>[-Spotting the noun phrase at the beginning of A-version, the polisher changed it at once to a construction with a verb: "When they first entered."</p>
<p>-Then she deleted "areas" as redundant with "heartland."</p>
<p>-Next she changed "had only a population of" to "numbered only," a version that was shorter and eliminated another abstract noun.</p>
<p>-The second sentence seemed to be the statement of just another, unrelated fact. To make the connection between the two, she inserted "But."</p>
<p>-Then she moved "during the years when the Qing dynasty etc."out of the final position so as to end with the main clause giving the new and much larger figure. At the same time she reduced "reached the apex in development" to "was at its height."</p>
<p>-As a last improvement, she changed "this figure rose" to "their population rose," the second word, although still an abstraction, being more concrete than the first.]</p>
<p>17) A: <u>Encouraged</u>
 by new oil finds across the country, the long-term <u>strategy</u>
 for China's petrochemical industry is to double <u>its crude oil processing capacity</u>
 and <u>chemical production</u>
 by the end of the century <u>to meet the rising domestic demand</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: <i>Encouraged</i>
 by new oil finds across the country, <i>and hoping to meet the rising domestic demand, China's petrochemical industry</i>
 has established the long-range <i>goal</i>
 of doubling <i>its capacity to process crude oil</i>
 and <i>its production of chemicals</i>
 by the end of the century.</p>
<p>[-Noting the past participle at the beginning of A-version, the polisher looked for the noun it modified. The noun was present ("industry"), but it was not the subject of the sentence; in its place she found "strategy."</p>
<p>-To correct this error she rearranged the elements: "Encouraged by new oil finds across the country, China's petrochemical industry has adopted a long-term strategy of doubling... ."</p>
<p>-When she came to "crude oil processing capacity," she recognized the dense modifier as a manifestation of the noun plague and broke it up into its logical components: "its capacity to process crude oil."</p>
<p>-"Chemical production" was not so objectionable, since "chemical" was not a noun but a genuine adjective. Still, in the interest of parallel structure, she broke that down too: "the production of chemicals."</p>
<p>-The revision now stood as follows: "Encouraged by new oil finds across the country, China's petrochemical industry has adopted a long-term strategy of doubling its capacity to process crude oil and its production of chemicals by the end of the century to meet the rising domestic demand."</p>
<p>-That version was grammatically correct and easier to comprehend, but the polisher thought it could be further improved.</p>
<p>-For purposes of emphasis, the subordinate phrase "to meet the rising demand" should be moved out of its final position. And to make a tighter logical connection and increase the parallelism, she could convert it to a participial phrase matching "Encouraged by."</p>
<p>-This produced: "Encouraged by new oil finds across the country, and hoping to meet the rising domestic demand, China's petrochemical industry... ."</p>
<p>-Only then did the polisher realize that "strategy" was not the logical word here. Doubling production was not a "strategy" the industry had adopted but a "goal" it had established. When she had made that change, she was content with the revision.]</p>
<p>18) A: We must <u>do our best</u>
 to <u>employ diversified means</u>
 to use foreign funds to accelerate <u>China's</u>
 economic develop-ment....</p>
<p>B: We must use foreign funds <i>in different ways</i>
 to accelerate economic development....</p>
<p>[-The polisher decided that "do our best" had no special meaning here but was only the conventional introductory phrase. She therefore edited it out.</p>
<p>-The statement obviously referred to China, so she deleted "China's" as superfluous.</p>
<p>-She then decided that "employ diversified means to use foreign funds" was only a pretentious way of saying "use different means to use foreign funds," which itself was none too clear. She expressed the idea simply: "use foreign funds in different ways."]</p>
<p>19) A: The general calls issued by the Comintern were not in conformity with the realities of different countries, and it made concrete arrangements for <u>various parties</u>
 <u>instead of giving them overall guidance</u>
 , <u>resulting in interfering</u>
 with the internal affairs of <u>various Communist parties</u>
 ....</p>
<p>B: The general calls issued by the Comintern were not in conformity with the realities of different countries, and <i>instead of giving individual parties overall guidance</i>
 , it made concrete arrangements for them, <i>thus interfering</i>
 in <i>their</i>
 internal affairs...</p>
<p>[-The polisher started by eliminating the obvious repetition: "various parties" and "various Communist parties."</p>
<p>-"Various," she thought, was unnec. in both places and could be usefully replaced in the first instance with "individual."The second reference to the parties ("the internal affairs of various Communist parties") could be easily replaced with the possessive pronoun "their" ("their internal affairs").</p>
<p>-Next she addressed the more serious problem of the dangling participle. "Resulting in" had nothing in particular to modify and tried vainly to attach itself to the subject of its clause, "it" (= the Comintern), which, however, was not resulting in anything.</p>
<p>-The easiest solution seemed to be to change the participle to one that could logically modify the subject: "it made concrete arrangements for individual parties instead of giving them overall guidance, thus interfering in their internal affairs."The new participle, "interfering," was now sensibly attached to "it" (the Comintern): "it" was interfering in the internal affairs of the individual parties.</p>
<p>-At this stage the revision read: "The general calls issued by the Comintern were not in conformity with the realities of different countries, and it made concrete arrangements for the individual parties instead of giving them overall guidance, thus interfering in their internal affairs."</p>
<p>-Rereading this version, the polisher realized that the subordinate phrase "instead of giving them overall guidance" was in the wrong place. For proper emphasis it should come first, leaving the main point (what the Comintern <i>did</i>
 do) to the end: "... and instead of giving individual parties overall guidance, it made concrete arrangements for them, thus interfering... ."</p>
<p>-She made that change, noting with satisfaction that it placed the participle ("thus interfering") in a more logical position. Now it directly followed the action to which it referred—making concrete arrangements for individual parties.]</p>
<p>20) A: <u>Keeping a basic balance</u>
 of international payments <u>is an important condition for achieving</u>
 <u>sustained and smooth</u>
 economic development.... Last year <u>China's import increased considerably and its growth of export was relatively slow</u>
 , thus <u>resulting</u>
 in a <u>fairly</u>
 huge trade deficit.</p>
<p>B: <i>An important condition for achieving steady</i>
 economic development <i>is to maintain</i>
 a basic balance of international payments.... Last year <i>imports increased considerably while exports grew relatively slowly, with the result that</i>
 there was a huge trade deficit.</p>
<p>[-This was an example of the frequent Chinglish construction beginning with a gerund: "doing x is an important condition for doing y."The polisher reversed the order to put the main point at the end, and in the process changed the gerund "Keeping" to an infinitive, "to keep."</p>
<p>-Now the sentence read: "An important condition for achieving sustained and smooth economic development is to keep a basic balance of international payments."</p>
<p>-Then she made minor changes that she thought improved the wording: "sustained and smooth" became " steady," which implied both; "to keep" became "to maintain."</p>
<p>-Turning to the second sentence, the polisher first eliminated the superfluous modifiers: "China's" and "its" because they were obvious, and "fairly" because it was an unnecessary qualifier that only undercut the force of "huge."</p>
<p>-Next she studied "import increased considerably and growth of export was relatively slow."The two elements linked by "and" were minimally parallel, in that both were independent clauses. But "import" was aligned with "growth," and "increased" with "was slow," neither pair being a good match.</p>
<p>-To enhance the parallelism she balanced "imports" with its natural mate "exports" and "increased" with its synonym "grew" : "imports increased considerably and exports grew relatively slowly."(She was pleased to note that this revision also converted a noun, "growth," into a verb, "grew.")</p>
<p>-On rereading, the polisher decided that although "and" was not a wrong connective, "while" would be more precise. She made that change too.</p>
<p>-Finally, she paused over "thus resulting in."On first reading she had not found the phrase objectionable, but on closer inspection she saw that the participle was dangling without an expressed subject. It was not either "imports" or "exports" that had resulted in the deficit, but the combination of circumstances described.</p>
<p>-She thought briefly about supplying the true subject: "imports increased considerably while exports grew relatively slowly, a combination of circumstances resulting in a huge deficit."But that seemed wordy and complicated.</p>
<p>-How about "imports increased considerably while exports grew relatively slowly, which resulted in a huge deficit" ? But the "which" would not have a clear antecedent.</p>
<p>-She decided the best solution was to replace "resulting" with "with the result that."]</p>
<p>21) A: <u>Revitalization and further development</u>
 of agricultural production <u>represents the central task</u>
 in our <u>current efforts to adjust</u>
 the <u>national</u>
 economy.</p>
<p>B: <i>Our central task in adjusting</i>
 the economy is to <i>revitalize and expand</i>
 agricultural production.</p>
<p>[-The polisher first eliminated the superfluous modifiers "further" and "national," because the sense of both could be taken for granted.</p>
<p>-Next she turned the abstract nouns "revitalization" and "development" into verbs: "To revitalize and develop agricultural production represents the central task in our current efforts to adjust the economy."</p>
<p>-Then, considering that "current" was obvious and "efforts" added nothing but another noun, she reduced "in our current efforts to adjust the economy" to "in adjusting the economy."</p>
<p>-The revision now stood as follows: "To revitalize and develop agricultural production represents our central task in adjusting the economy."</p>
<p>-In accordance with the principle that the main point should come last, the polisher moved "in adjusting the economy" to the beginning of the sentence: "In adjusting the economy, our central task is to revitalize... ."</p>
<p>-But strictly speaking, this version left the introductory gerund "adjusting" dangling. The implied subject of "adjusting" was "we," but the subject of the sentence was "our task."</p>
<p>-In the presence of "our," which made it clear that "we" were doing the adjusting, the point was arguable. Still, the polisher judged it best to move the gerund to a safer position: "Our central task in adjusting the economy is to revitalize... ."</p>
<p>-As a final slight improvement, she then changed the vague and overworked "develop" to "expand."</p>
<p>-Note that the structural change here is the same as in the preceding example. Here "Revitalization... represents the central task" became "Our central task is to revitalize... ." In example 20 "Keeping a basic balance... is an important condition for achieving . . ."became "An important condition for achieving... is to maintain a basic balance... ."]</p>
<p>22) A: Fourth, Ma discussed <u>reform steps and measures</u>
 . He said that <u>China's reform</u>
 <u>has unprecedented and unique characteristics</u>
 . <u>Reform</u>
 is carried out <u>gradually in a planned and step-by-step way</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: Fourth, Ma discussed <i>measures</i>
 to be taken. He said that <i>the reform, which was an unprecedented enterprise</i>
 , had to be carried out <i>one step at a time, according to a plan.</i>
</p>
<p>[-The polisher's attention was first drawn to the three sets of redundant twins, "steps and measures," "unprecedented and unique," and "gradually" /“in a step-by-step way."She eliminated one of each set.</p>
<p>-While she was dealing with this last pair, she considered what could be done to change the entire modifier. The familiar formula "step-by-step and in a planned way," of which this was a variant, was by now a tiresome cliché to which the reader would probably pay no attention.</p>
<p>-She recast the idea in a somewhat fresher—and more idiomatic—form: "one step at a time, according to a plan."</p>
<p>-Next, she decided that since Ma was now well into a lengthy discussion of the economic reform in China—he was making his "fourth" point, after all—there was no need at this stage to specify that he was talking about "reform" measures in "China."She deleted both modifiers.</p>
<p>-The third "reform" she replaced with the pronoun "it."</p>
<p>-After these changes the revision read as follows: "Fourth, Ma discussed measures to be taken. He said that the reform has unprecedented characteristics. It is carried out one step at a time, according to a plan."</p>
<p>-The polisher thought she had now eliminated as many unnecessary words as possible, but the new version sounded choppy, and it still didn't make much sense. The logical connections between the three ideas were not clear; in particular, the second sentence had no apparent relation to either of the others.</p>
<p>-Studying the passage in context, she determined what the intended relation was: <u>because</u>
 we have no precedents to go by, we have to proceed carefully, taking measures one at a time in an orderly way.</p>
<p>-The notion of cause and effect had not been spelled out in the Chinese, and apparently it had not been well understood by the translator. Accordingly, he or she had simply said that reform "<u>is</u>
 carried out gradually etc. ," whereas the sense was that for this reason it "<u>must be</u>
 carried out gradually etc."</p>
<p>-To suggest the logical connection between ideas without adding too much to the original, the polisher converted the second sentence into a subordinate clause and changed the tense of the third: "... the reform, which was an unprecedented enterprise, had to be carried out one step at a time, according to a plan."]</p>
<p>23) A: <u>To the reactionary classes coercion must be applied</u>
 <u>and when dealing with</u>
 matters within the ranks of the democratic classes, the principle of voluntariness <u>must be observed</u>
 , because <u>it</u>
 is a cooperative undertaking and cooperation admits of no coercion.</p>
<p>B: <i>When dealing with the reactionary classes, we must use coercion, but when dealing with</i>
 matters within the ranks of the democratic classes, <i>we must observe</i>
 the principle of voluntariness, because <i>with them the implementation of state capitalism</i>
 is a cooperative undertaking, and cooperation admits of no coercion.</p>
<p>[-The polisher had to read A-version several times before she began to grasp its meaning. As a first step toward clarifying the sentence, she changed the verbs to active voice.</p>
<p>-This produced: "To the reactionary classes we must apply coercion, and when dealing with matters within the ranks of the democratic classes, we must observe the principle of voluntariness."That was easier to understand, and the introduction of the subject "we" served to anchor the dangling participial phrase "when dealing with etc."</p>
<p>-Then she realized that another source of her confusion was the "and"—it was the wrong logical connective and consequently misleading. The second clause stood in contrast to the first, a relation that should be indicated by "but."</p>
<p>-Next, she considered the question of parallel structure. The speaker was contrasting two different approaches to the same problem, so it would help the reader if the two were expressed in matching form.</p>
<p>-To make the two approaches more nearly parallel, she repeated in the first clause the phrase "when dealing with," which was used in the second clause: "When dealing with the reactionary classes, we must use coercion, but when dealing with matters within the ranks of the democratic classes, we must... ."</p>
<p>-So much for the first part of the sentence. Moving on to the second, she saw at once that the pronoun "it," which at first seemed to represent "the principle," had no antecedent.</p>
<p>-Checking the preceding text to review the line of argument, she found that the paragraph as a whole dealt with the implementation of state capitalism. It was that phrase, which had appeared two sentences earlier, that the translator's "it" was supposed to stand for. She made the change accordingly: "because the implementation of state capitalism is a cooperative undertaking."</p>
<p>-But plainly, that applied only to the democratic classes; the reactionary classes were by no means cooperative, which was precisely why they had to be coerced. To make this distinction clear, the polisher added "with them" : "because with them (= the democratic classes just mentioned) the implementation of state capitalism is a cooperative undertaking.”]</p>
<p>24) A: <u>It is a major reform</u>
 in our <u>Party leadership system</u>
 <u>from the situation in which the responsibilities of the Party have not been separated from those of the government</u>
 to <u>that of the separating of the Party and the government</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: <i>Separating the functions of Party and government is a major reform</i>
 in the <i>system of Party leadership.</i>
</p>
<p>[-It was only after the polisher had read A-version two or three times that she grasped what the writer was trying to say.</p>
<p>-Analyzing why she had had so much trouble, she noted first that the pattern of the sentence—"it is a major reform from x to y"—was not English. It was not a "reform" from x to y but a "change" from x to y.</p>
<p>-She started the revision by introducing that word: "A major reform in our Party leadership system is the change from the situation in which... ."</p>
<p>-Then she backed up to eliminate "situation" : "A major reform in our Party leadership system is the change from not separating the responsibilities of the Party from those of the government to separating the Party and the government."</p>
<p>-But the intended meaning was clearly "the change from not separating the responsibilities of the Party from those of the government to separating the <u>responsibilities</u>
 of the Party and the government”—or, to avoid repeating the long phrase, "the change from not separating the responsibilities of the Party from those of the government to separating <u>them</u>
 ."</p>
<p>-But then she realized that a change from "not separating" to "separating" was only a restatement of the same idea, first in negative form then in positive.</p>
<p>-Seeing that the repetition was inevitable so long as she retained the "change from x to y," she abandoned that formula: "It is a major reform in our Party leadership system to separate the functions of the Party from those of the government."</p>
<p>-To avoid using two nouns as adjectives, she changed "Party leadership system" to "the system of Party leadership."</p>
<p>-Only a few minor changes still had to be made. She corrected the order of ideas to emphasize the importance of the reform and at the same time tightened the wording: "Separating the functions of Party and government is a major reform in the system of Party leadership."</p>
<p>-That, she thought, was a sentence that could be understood on the first reading... and it was less than half as long as A-version.]</p>
<p>25) A: Nationwide <u>surprise</u>
 inspections are <u>expected</u>
 to take place <u>next month</u>
 to ensure sanitary conditions in restaurants, unit canteens and roadside food stands. <u>It</u>
 is one of the activities that the Ministry of Health has <u>scheduled</u>
 to publicize the Food Hygiene Law <u>in the first week of November</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: <i>In the first week of November</i>
 nationwide <i>surprise</i>
 inspections are <i>scheduled</i>
 to take place to ensure sanitary conditions in restaurants, unit canteens and roadside food stands. <i>These</i>
 are among the activities that the Ministry of Health has <i>planned</i>
 to publicize the Food Hygiene Law.</p>
<p>[-The first thing that caught the polisher's attention was the seeming contradiction between "surprise" inspections and their being "expected."But that was a small matter, and she moved on, making a mental note to return to it later.</p>
<p>-Next she found that the pronoun "It" at the head of the second sentence had no antecedent. Or rather, it had a logical antecedent, "inspections," but the antecedent was plural whereas the pronoun was singular. To make them agree she changed "It is one of the activities" to "These are among the activities."</p>
<p>-Then, seeing that the second sentence ended in a prepositional phrase ("in the first week of November"), she considered whether the phrase was in the right place. Deciding it was not, she moved it up, making it modify "has scheduled" rather than "to publicize."</p>
<p>-The result was: "These are among the activities that the Ministry of Health has scheduled for the first week of November to publicize the Food Hygiene Law."That seemed somewhat more logical, and it gave more prominence to the important element, "the Food Hygiene Law."</p>
<p>-But on rereading the revised version she noticed that there were two mentions of dates: "for the first week of November" in the second sentence and "next month" in the first. Presumably both referred to the time of the inspections and other activities.</p>
<p>-To avoid two references to the same thing, she deleted "next month" and moved "in the first week of November" to the beginning.</p>
<p>-Satisfied that the two sentences were now grammatical and concise, she returned to the question of the "surprise" inspections that were "expected" to take place. To make sure that other readers were not distracted by the apparent contradiction, she simply changed "expected" to "scheduled."</p>
<p>-Then, to avoid repeating the word in the second sentence, she changed "has scheduled" to "has planned."]</p>
<p>26) A: As the simplification of Chinese characters is in the interest of the <u>broad</u>
 masses, we intellectuals should <u>actively support it</u>
 <u>instead of taking a passive attitude toward it</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: As the simplification of Chinese characters is in the interest of the masses, we intellectuals should <i>not just passively accept it but actively support it.</i>
</p>
<p>[-The polisher first deleted "broad," since the notion of "broad" was implicitly contained in the word "masses."</p>
<p>-That done, she addressed the main problem, "actively support it instead of taking a passive attitude toward it."She recognized this as an example of the mirror-image construction in which the same thing is stated twice, first in the positive then in the negative.</p>
<p>-Her first impulse was to delete the negative statement, since it added nothing to the meaning. But this sentence appeared in a speech by Premier Zhou Enlai, and she was reluctant to take liberties with it.</p>
<p>-As an alternative, she looked for a way to change the wording of the negative statement so that it would not seem so empty. Since "instead of taking a passive attitude toward it" was vague at best, she tried spelling the phrase out to give it more content: "instead of just passively accepting it."</p>
<p>-Now the second clause read "we intellectuals should actively support it, instead of just passively accepting it."That was an improvement not just because the double statement now made a discernible point, but also because the two elements were cast in parallel form.</p>
<p>-The sentence was still not satisfactory, however, because the order of the two statements was wrong, giving prominence to what intellectuals should <i>not</i>
 do. To correct the emphasis the polisher reversed the order, putting the negative statement first: "we intellectuals should not just passively accept it but actively support it."]</p>
<p>27) A: These four activities <u>carried out by</u>
 the Communist groups gave a powerful impetus to the dissemination of Marxism and to <u>its</u>
 integration with the workers' movement. Those intellectuals who <u>had just fostered their belief</u>
 in communism gradually <u>had</u>
 profound changes in their thinking and their <u>feelings</u>
 <u>while they were integrating themselves with the workers</u>
 ; a number of workers had learned something about Marxism and raised their class consciousness, <u>both becoming</u>
 advanced elements of the proletariat.</p>
<p>B: These four activities <i>of</i>
 the Communist groups gave a powerful impetus to the dissemination of Marxism and to <i>their</i>
 integration with the workers' movement. <i>In the process,</i>
 those intellectuals who <i>had only recently come to believe</i>
 in communism gradually <i>underwent</i>
 profound changes in their thinking and in their <i>attitude toward workers. At the same time,</i>
 a number of workers learned something about Marxism and raised their class consciousness, <i>so that both groups became</i>
 advanced elements of the proletariat.</p>
<p>[-The polisher first deleted the empty words "carried out by," replacing them with a simple "of" : "These four activities of the Communist groups."</p>
<p>-Next she made some minor corrections of wording: "those intellectuals who had just fostered their belief in communism" became "those intellectuals who had just come to believe in communism.""Had profound changes in their thinking" became "underwent profound changes in their thinking."</p>
<p>-After those easy changes, she was somewhat at sea. She had to read A-version several times before she understood the basic point of the passage—that through these activities the intellectuals became integrated with the workers and that both parties were changed by the process.</p>
<p>-Once she reached that understanding, she saw what revisions were necessary to make it clear to the reader.</p>
<p>-First, it was not Marxism that was integrated with the workers' movement but the Communist groups. Therefore, "its" integration should become "their."</p>
<p>-Second, the vague and general "feelings" of the intellectuals (the nature of which was only implied in the original) should be spelled out precisely as their "attitude toward workers."</p>
<p>-Third, it should be made plain that what the workers learned was another result of this same process of integration. That could be done with the introduction of a logical connective, "At the same time."And this was a good point at which to break a sentence that was too long.</p>
<p>-The revised version now stood as follows: "These four activities of the Communist groups gave a powerful impetus to the dissemination of Marxism and to their integration with the workers' movement. Those intellectuals who had just come to believe in communism gradually underwent profound changes in their thinking and in their attitude toward workers while they were integrating themselves with the workers. At the same time, a number of workers learned something about Marxism and raised their class consciousness, both becoming advanced elements of the proletariat."</p>
<p>-But now the "both" at the end, which was already none too clear in A-version, was even farther removed from "those intellectuals," which it was intended to include. To make the meaning plain, she spelled it out with the help of another logical connective: "... raised their class consciousness, so that both groups became advanced elements of the proletariat."</p>
<p>-Rereading this version, the polisher thought that the sense was clear and the language idiomatic. But she now saw that the subordinate "while" clause at the end of the second sentence should go at the beginning, leaving the final position to the main point, the statement that the intellectuals had undergone profound changes.</p>
<p>-She moved the clause and reread once more: "These four activities of the Communist groups gave a powerful impetus to the dissemination of Marxism and to their integration with the workers' movement. While they were integrating themselves with the workers, those intellectuals who had just come to believe in communism . . ."</p>
<p>-When she reached that point she became aware that she was repeating herself. Now that "While they were integrating themselves with the workers" immediately followed "their integration with the workers' movement," she could see that they were two references to the same idea.</p>
<p>-To eliminate the repetition, she replaced the second reference, "While they were integrating themselves," with a summary phrase, "In the process."]</p>
<p>28) A: We have to <u>pay attention to</u>
 <u>lowering the average age</u>
 of <u>members of the leading bodies</u>
 and <u>selecting</u>
 Marxists as <u>leaders</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: We have to <i>select as members of the leading bodies younger people</i>
 and Marxists.</p>
<p>[-The empty introductory phrase "pay attention to" was the first to go: "We have to lower the average age... and select... ."</p>
<p>-Next, "members of the leading bodies" were plainly the same as "leaders," so one of them could be dispensed with. The first expression recommended itself to the polisher as being more specific, so she deleted "as leaders."</p>
<p>-The sentence now read: "We have to lower the average age of members of the leading bodies and select Marxists."That, she thought, could be simplified and condensed: "We have to select as members... younger people and Marxists."]</p>
<p>29) A: Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Michael Suen said at a luncheon yesterday that an independent Electoral Affairs Commission will be established, <u>which will present</u>
 plans on <u>geographical constituency demarcation</u>

 .</p>
<p>B: Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Michael Suen said at a luncheon yesterday that an independent Electoral Affairs Commission will be established. <i>By the end of October the commission will present to the chief executive</i>
 plans for the <i>demarcation of geographical constituencies,</i>
 voter registration and election procedures.</p>
<p>[-The polisher's first concern was the "which" : instead of coming immediately after the noun it referred to ("Commission") in the normal way, it was separated from its antecedent by the intervening verb "will be established."The sense was clear enough, but the word order was nevertheless illogical and disconcerting.</p>
<p>-The simplest solution seemed to be to abandon the "which" clause and start over with a new sentence. (Such a break was indicated in any event because A-version presented too much information for the reader to swallow in one mouthful. )</p>
<p>-This left the question of where to put the two prepositional phrases "to the chief executive" and "before the end of October," both of which were far removed from the verb they were logically attached to, "will present."</p>
<p>-The first found its normal place as indirect object immediately after the verb ("present to the chief executive"). The second was moved to the beginning of the sentence, where it plainly modified the same verb ("By the end of October the Commission will present").</p>
<p>-The changes introduced for reasons of logic also achieved the proper emphasis: the place of prominence at the end was now occupied by the plans themselves.</p>
<p>-Lastly, the polisher broke up the daunting noun-as-adjective construction "geographical constituency demarcation" with the preposition "of."She allowed "voter registration" and "election procedures" to remain, however, because they would be familiar to readers and hence readily understandable. )]</p>
<p>30) A: The Leftist adventurism <u>in this resolution</u>
 <u>found its expression</u>
 first in the <u>totally</u>
 incorrect assessment of the situation, <u>maintaining</u>
 that the <u>great</u>
 decisive battle was just round the corner for both the Chinese and the world revolution. <u>It</u>
 wrote, "the fundamental political and economic crisis in China continues to sharpen in <u>totally</u>
 identical manner in <u>each and every</u>
 part of the country without the slightest essential difference."</p>
<p>B: <i>In this resolution</i>
 "Left" adventurism <i>manifested itself in several ways.</i>
 First, <i>the Political Bureau</i>
 made a totally incorrect assessment of the situation, <i>maintaining</i>
 that the decisive battle not only for the Chinese revolution but for the world revolution was just around the corner. "The fundamental political and economic crisis in China," <i>the Bureau</i>
 wrote, "continues to sharpen in an identical manner in every part of the country without the slightest essential difference."</p>
<p>[-On reading A-version, the polisher was brought to a halt as soon as she reached "maintaining."The participle was adrift with nothing to modify ("adventurism" cannot hold an opinion). Consequently, her first concern was to anchor it to a subject.</p>
<p>-She knew from the preceding sentence that the proper subject was the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, which had adopted the resolution in question, so she used that: "The 'Left' adventurism in this resolution found its expression first in the totally incorrect assessment that the Political Bureau made of the situation, maintaining that the decisive battle etc."("Great" was an unnec. intensifier. )</p>
<p>-She was soon stopped again by "It wrote."The pronoun had no antecedent ("adventurism" cannot write anything either). Happily, the introduction of the Political Bureau solved that problem too—she could now put "the Bureau wrote."</p>
<p>-Next the polisher deleted "totally."The word had just been used ("totally incorrect"), but more important, it was a redundant intensifier. Things that are "identical" are exactly (i. e., "totally") the same; otherwise they would merely be "similar."</p>
<p>-Immediately after, she deleted "each" from the pair of twins "each and every."</p>
<p>-These faults, and the appropriate corrections, had suggested themselves to the polisher at once, on her first reading. Now she went back to see if there were any less obvious ones that she had missed.</p>
<p>-The second time around, the prepositional phrase "in this resolution" struck her as a misplaced modifier. "Adventurism" was not "in this resolution" ; if anywhere, it was in the Politburo. It only "found its expression"—or, better, "manifested itself"—in the resolution.</p>
<p>-To make this clear, she moved the phrase to the beginning of the sentence: "In this resolution 'Left' adventurism manifested itself first in the totally incorrect assessment... ."</p>
<p>-Satisfied with her revision, the polisher moved on. But when she read the next few paragraphs, she found that they cited other manifestations of adventurism in the Politburo's resolution—indeed, they began "Second," "Third" and "Fourth."She therefore returned to this passage to make one further revision.</p>
<p>-To clarify the logic, she rewrote the first sentence: "In this resolution 'Left' adventurism manifested itself in several ways. First, the Political Bureau made a totally incorrect assessment... ."</p>
<p>-Adding "in several ways" indicated that more than one "way" would be cited. Making "first" the beginning of a new sentence prepared the reader for a series of points to be expressed in matching form.]</p>
<p>31) A: It would be very difficult to <u>accomplish the task of reclaiming as much as</u>
 140 million <i>mu</i>
 of land in <u>a period of</u>
 twelve years....</p>
<p>B: It would be very difficult to <i>reclaim so great an area as</i>
 140 million <i>mu</i>
 ) in <i>just</i>
 twelve years....</p>
<p>[-The polisher saw at once that "accomplish the task of reclaiming" was the familiar Chinglish construction, unnec. verb + unnec. noun + third word that expresses the real action. She deleted the unnec. words and converted the third word (in this case a gerund) to a verb: "to reclaim."</p>
<p>-Coming to "a period of," she recognized that used in this way, it was only a superfluous category noun introducing "twelve years."She edited it out.</p>
<p>-Then, to underline the logic of the statement, she added "just."This word told the reader that what followed would be a short period of time, considering the magnitude of the task.</p>
<p>-Rereading the new version, the polisher was not satisfied with "as much as," especially followed by <i>mu</i>
 , which a foreign reader might not immediately recognize as a unit of land measure. She substituted the more specific phrase "so great an area as" and omitted "of land" as unnec.]</p>
<p>32) A: In March the same year, Li Dazhao, after repeated consultations with Deng Zhongxia and others, set up at Beijing University a society <u>for the study of Marxist theories</u>

 ."</p>
<p>B: In March the same year Li Dazhao, after repeated consultations with Deng Zhongxia and others, set up at Beijing University a society <i>for the study of Marxist theories</i>
 . This was the first <i>such</i>
 body established in China and the first attempt by Li Dazhao to assemble "people <i>who have some interest in Marxist theories</i>
 and <i>those who want to study them."</i>
</p>
<p>[-The chief problem in this passage was clearly that it was so repetitive. The study of Marxism was mentioned no less than four times in two successive sentences.</p>
<p>-First the polisher replaced "the first body established in China for learning and studying Marxism" with a simple "such" : "This was the first such body established in China." (This revision also eliminated the redundant twins "learning" and "studying.")</p>
<p>-The rest of that sentence was the simplest possible example of the same thing said twice—the second clause ("those who are willing to study etc.") was only a restatement of the first ("those who are interested in the study etc.") in virtually identical terms. The polisher deleted the second, leaving only “... to assemble 'those who are interested in studying the theories of the Marxist school. '"</p>
<p>-It was a second polisher who, comparing this version with the Chinese, objected to the omission on the grounds that the original text referred to two different groups of people. The difficulty was that A-version made no clear distinction between them and was therefore merely redundant.</p>
<p>-To remedy this failing, the two polishers agreed on a third version: “... to assemble 'people who have some interest in Marxist theories and those who want to study them. '" ]</p>
<p>33) A: In order to build a new democratic country, the Congress <u>put forth</u>
 again <u>the slogan of abolishing</u>
 the Kuomintang one-party dictatorship and <u>forming</u>
 a democratic coalition government. It also expounded in detail the <u>programs on such aspects as politics, economy and culture</u>
 , which would be carried out <u>in the new democratic country</u>
 . <u>In view of the fact that</u>
 <u>the Kuomintang ruling clique pursued policies of betraying</u>
 our country, <u>staging</u>
 civil war and <u>exercising</u>
 dictatorship, the Congress called on the whole Party to be prepared for another eventuality, that is, the breakout of the civil war <u>while striving for the establishment of a coalition government</u>
 . If the KMT waged a civil war, the people would respond by waging a revolutionary war to overthrow the reactionary regime and build a new China.</p>
<p>B: To build a new democratic country, the congress again <i>called for the abolition</i>
 of the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship and the <i>formation</i>
 of a democratic coalition government. It also expounded in detail the <i>political, economic, and cultural programs</i>
 to be carried out. <i>However, since the policy of the Kuomintang ruling clique was to betray</i>
 the country, <i>launch</i>
 civil war, and <i>maintain</i>
 its dictatorship, the congress called on the entire Party membership, <i>while striving for the establishment of a coalition government,</i>
 to prepare for another eventuality: the outbreak of civil war. If the KMT waged a civil war, the people would respond by waging a revolutionary war to overthrow the reactionary regime and build a new China.</p>
<p>[-The polisher first made two minor improvements that suggested themselves almost at once. To reduce the population of nouns and gerunds, she (1) changed "put forth the slogan of abolishing... and forming" to "called for the abolition... and formation" and (2) replaced "In view of the fact that" with "Since."</p>
<p>-Then she addressed the main problem: A-version was hard to follow. On rereading, she saw that in the first two sentences the congress was envisioning the formation of a coalition government, but that in the last two it spoke of the opposite possibility, the outbreak of civil war.</p>
<p>-The difficulty was that the reader was given no indication of the change and therefore assumed that the third sentence would continue along the same line of thought as the first two.</p>
<p>-To give the reader notice that the content of the third sentence would contrast with that of the preceding ones, she inserted a "However."</p>
<p>-Another confusing element in A-version (third sentence) was the placement of the participial phrase "while striving for the establishment of a coalition government."It was far removed from the noun it was intended to modify: "the whole Party," or, as she now thought better, "the entire Party membership."</p>
<p>-To make a clearer logical progression, the polisher moved the subordinate phrase up in the sentence: “... the congress called on the entire Party membership, while striving for the establishment of a coalition government, to prepare for another eventuality: the outbreak of civil war."</p>
<p>-This rearrangement left "the outbreak of civil war" at the end of the sentence, where it led without interruption directly into the next idea: "If the KMT waged a civil war etc."</p>
<p>-Equally important, the change of order placed the emphasis on the dramatic words "the outbreak of civil war."In A-version their impact had been dissipated in the subordinate phrase ("while striving etc."), which came as a feeble anticlimax.</p>
<p>-After these clarifications, the polisher reread the new version to see if any more changes needed to be made. "Programs on such aspects as economy, politics and culture" had bothered her from the beginning. It was the familiar Chinglish construction with free-floating "aspects"—aspects of <u>what</u>
 was not stated.</p>
<p>-The "aspects" were in any event superfluous, since one could simply say, "political, economic, and cultural programs."She made that change and at the same time eliminated "in the new democratic country" as evident from the context.</p>
<p>-One other point caught her attention: "the KMT ruling clique pursued policies of betraying our country, staging civil war and exercising dictatorship."A simpler and more natural structure would be "the policy of the KMT ruling clique was to do x, y, and z."That version also recommended itself because it replaced three gerunds with verbs. She revised the clause accordingly.]</p>
<p>34) A: We are working to build a great socialist community in which all nationalities will <u>enjoy a thriving and affluent life</u>
 ....</p>
<p>B: We are working to build a great socialist community in which all nationalities will <i>thrive and prosper</i>
 ....</p>
<p>[-"Enjoy a thriving and affluent life" was another unnec. verb + unnec. noun + third word construction. The polisher deleted the unnec. words and changed the ones bearing the content (in this case two adjectives) into verbs: "to thrive and prosper."</p>
<p>-It could be argued that "thriving" and "affluent" ("thrive" and "prosper") are redundant twins. It might have been sufficient to say: "in which all nationalities will enjoy a high standard of living (<i>or:</i>
 a life of abundance).”]</p>

<p>B: A landslide caused 12 deaths in Lushui County, Yunnan Province, last Friday. <i>China Daily</i>
 learned yesterday that <i>on Sunday</i>
 13 <i>people were still</i>
 missing and 11 houses <i>remained</i>
 buried under the earth. Heavy rain had <i>caused a mass of earth 750 meters wide, 300 meters high</i>
 and with a volume of 60, 000 cubic meters to <i>slide</i>
 about 20 meters downhill. The landslide damaged 182 households, affecting 1, 100 people. <i>And according to the report</i>
 the danger remains, as 1. 5 million cubic meters of earth are still moving.</p>
<p>[-A-version appeared in print, but a careful reviser might have improved upon it.</p>
<p>-First, "others" has the wrong antecedent. It is intended to refer to "other persons," but the antecedent on the page is "deaths."It is not other "deaths" that are missing.</p>
<p>-Second, the placement of "last Sunday" makes it unclear what the phrase modifies. Moved up to precede the verb, it would apply to both the missing persons and the buried houses. The sense could be made clearer by the addition of "still" missing ("still" buried being changed to "remained" for variety).</p>
<p>-Third, an awkward construction with a gerund could be smoothed out by changing "resulted in a mass of earth sliding" to "caused a mass of earth to slide."</p>
<p>-Fourth, the pileup of nouns and adjectives before "mass of earth" could be avoided by giving the dimensions afterward.</p>
<p>-Fifth, "But" is misleading. The logical connection between the description of the damage and the statement that danger remains is not "but" but rather "and," "moreover," or "furthermore."</p>
<p>-Lastly, the final sentence would be stronger if the subordinate reference to the report were moved to the beginning: "And according to the report the danger remains... ."]</p>
<p>36) A: This gradual transformation must be <u>undertaken in a planned way</u>
 and <u>leadership exercised over that</u>
 so that success will be assured <u>when conditions are ripe</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: This gradual transformation must be <i>well planned</i>
 and <i>properly led,</i>
 so that <i>when conditions are ripe</i>
 success will be assured.</p>
<p>[-As soon as the polisher had read this sentence, she read it over again, mentally supplying the missing verb: "This gradual transformation must be undertaken in a planned way and leadership <u>must be</u>
 exercised over that... ."At the same time she automatically changed "over that" to "over it."Having made those revisions for a start, she considered what other changes were needed.</p>
<p>-"Must be undertaken in a planned way" was just a wordy version of plain "must be planned."That substitution produced: "This gradual transformation must be planned and leadership must be exercised over it... ."</p>
<p>-But "leadership must be exercised over it" was again only a clumsy version of "it must be led" ("to exercise leadership over" = unnec. verb + unnec. noun for "to lead"). Thus, the version became: "This gradual transformation must be planned and led."</p>
<p>-That was much better—neater and with a greater degree of parallelism. But the implied sense was surely "must be well planned and properly led."The polisher added the two adverbs.</p>
<p>-Lastly, she moved the subordinate clause "when conditions are ripe" to precede the independent clause that made the important point: "success will be assured."]</p>
<p>37) A: We uphold <u>the Party's leadership</u>
 , but the problem is whether the Party is doing a good job of leading. It should give effective leadership and not intervene in too many matters. The Central Committee should take the lead in this regard. <u>This is not meant to weaken</u>
 <u>the Party's leadership</u>
 . <u>Too much intervention and mishandling of things will actually weaken</u>
 <u>the Party's leadership</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: We uphold <i>Party leadership,</i>
 but the problem is whether the Party is doing a good job of leading. It should give effective leadership and not intervene in too many matters. The Central Committee should take the lead in this regard. <i>What I am proposing will not weaken leadership by the Party. On the contrary, its leadership will be weakened if it tries to take responsibility for too many areas.</i>
</p>
<p>[-When the polisher reached the fourth sentence of A-version, she saw that the demonstrative pronoun "This" had no antecedent. Even if it was supposed to represent not just a particular word but an entire preceding idea, the reader could not tell what that idea was.</p>
<p>-She considered the context. The passage was part of a talk in which a senior leader was urging the necessity of separating the functions of the Party and the government and of delegating powers to lower levels. Clearly the implied subject of the sentence was this idea that he was putting forward. Accordingly, for "This" she substituted "What I am proposing."</p>
<p>-The polisher also thought the verb and tense were wrong. No Party leader would make a proposal that was "meant" to weaken the Party's leadership. The speaker was not explaining the intention of his proposal but predicting its result, hence: what I am proposing "will not weaken" the Party's leadership.</p>
<p>-Then she came to the last sentence: "Too much intervention and mishandling of things will actually weaken the Party's leadership."She found it unsatisfactory for several reasons. First, because it was based on a noun and a gerund ("intervention" and "mishandling"); second because it was vague (intervention in what? mishandling of what sort of things?); third because the point it was making was not clear.</p>
<p>-In view of these objections, she rewrote the sentence entirely. First she discarded both "intervention" and "mishandling" and spelled out what she perceived to be the meaning with a verb: "if it (= the Party) tries to take responsibility for too many areas."</p>
<p>-Then, to direct the reader's attention to the speaker's point, she placed the real danger, now expressed in the subordinate "if" clause, at the end: "Its leadership will be weakened if it tries to take responsibility for too many areas."</p>
<p>-That version, she thought, was an improvement, but rereading once more, she became aware of another problem: there was nothing to indicate the logical relation between the last two sentences.</p>
<p>-To make it easier for the reader to follow the speaker's line of argument, and at the same time to strengthen and clarify his assertion, she introduced "On the contrary."</p>
<p>-On a final rereading, she noticed that "the Party's leadership" was ambiguous. It could be understood as meaning "the leaders of the Party," which was not the intended sense. To avoid that possibility, she changed the first reference to "Party leadership" and the second to "leadership by the Party."Having made this last clarification, she thought the immediately following "its leadership" would be correctly understood.]</p>
<p>38) A: That same day Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, and other leaders of the Red Army <u>cabled</u>
 Chiang Kai-shek to indicate that the officers and men of the Red Army wished to "<u>deal with</u>
 the enemy <u>for the purpose of defending</u>
 the <u>land and country</u>
 and to save the life of the nation."</p>
<p>B: That same day Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, and other leaders of the Red Army <i>sent a telegram</i>
 to Chiang Kai-shek saying that the officers and men of the Red Army wished to "<i>engage</i>
 the enemy <i>to defend</i>
 the <i>country</i>
 and save the nation."</p>
<p>[-The polisher's first move was to fix a detail: she changed "cabled" to "sent a telegram to."Only messages that are transmitted over the wires of an underwater cable are "cabled," and at this point Chiang was still on the mainland.</p>
<p>-Then she considered the possible twins "land and country."One could make a distinction between the "country" (meaning the territory, or the people) and the "nation" (meaning the state, the political entity). But in this context, at any rate, she could find no significant difference between the "country" and the "land."Accordingly, she considered them redundant twins and deleted one of the pair.</p>
<p>-Next she changed "deal with" to "engage," partly because it was the more precise military term and partly to avoid ambiguity. "Deal with" can have many meanings in English. In this particular context, it might have been interpreted as meaning to "negotiate with" the enemy, to "make a deal."</p>
<p>-Lastly, the polisher changed "for the purpose of defending" to a simple infinitive, "to defend," thereby eliminating a noun and a gerund.]</p>
<p>39) A: In doing economic work in 1992, we shall, <u>under the guidance of the Party's basic line</u>
 , <u>step up the pace of</u>
 reform, <u>broaden the scope of opening</u>
 to the outside, <u>pay close attention to readjustment</u>
 of the economic structure and <u>improvement</u>
 of efficiency, <u>lay stress on improving</u>
 agriculture and large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, <u>and promote sustained, stable, and harmonious development of the national economy</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: In our economic work in 1992, <i>we shall follow the Party's basic line. To promote steady and harmonious development of the economy,</i>
 we shall <i>accelerate</i>
 the reform, <i>open wider</i>
 to the outside, and <i>concentrate on readjusting</i>
 the economic structure and <i>raising</i>
 efficiency, <i>particularly</i>
 in agriculture and in large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises.</p>
<p>[-This long and difficult sentence occurred in the draft translation of a report by Premier Li Peng to a session of the National People's Congress. Because it was an important document, the translation was reviewed by several polishers, each of whom made contributions to the final version. Consequently, it is hard to say in what order the changes were made. They are therefore listed here not necessarily in chronological order but in order of importance.</p>
<p>-The prepositional phrase "under the guidance of the Party's basic line" was converted to a separate clause: "we shall follow the Party's basic line."</p>
<p>-That change not only broke up a long sentence but clarified the logic. It gave more importance to the Party's basic line and indicated that all the tasks to be named afterward were aspects of that line. (The revision had the added advantage of eliminating an abstract noun, "guidance.")</p>
<p>-A second structural change was also made in the interest of logic. Studying the original, the polishers decided that the last element in the series ("and promote sustained, stable, and harmonious development of the national economy") was not intended to be coordinate with the others. Rather, it was the overarching purpose of all the other endeavors. In other words, the appropriate logical connective was not "and" but "in order to."</p>
<p>-As a result of this understanding the last phrase, which now expressed a subordinate idea, was moved up to the beginning of the sentence: "To promote sustained, stable, and harmonious development of the national economy, we shall... ." There it governed everything that followed, and at the same time it left the end of the sentence to the main clause, "we shall step up the pace etc."</p>
<p>-A third change of structure was made for reasons of logic as well. The polishers considered that the vague "lay stress on improving agriculture and large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises" was not a separate item in the list. Rather, it was a part of "readjustment of the economic structure and improvement of efficiency."</p>
<p>-This meant that the better translation was not "lay stress on" but "laying stress on" : "we shall... pay close attention to readjustment of the economic structure and improvement of efficiency, laying stress on improving agriculture and large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises."</p>
<p>-A number of unnecessary nouns and verbs were eliminated. "Step up the pace of reform" became "accelerate reform" ; "broaden the scope of opening" became "open wider" ; "pay close attention to readjustment... and improvement" became "concentrate on readjusting... and improving" ; and "laying stress on improving agriculture" became "particularly in agriculture."</p>
<p>-These simple changes did much to lighten the sentence and shorten it. In the final version, the net saving of words was 20%.</p>
<p>-"Sustained" and "stable" were identified as redundant twins, and both were replaced by "steady."</p>
<p>-"National" economy was deleted because it could be taken for granted.</p>
<p>-"Improving" efficiency was changed to the more precise term "raising."]</p>
<p>40) A: The <u>focus of work</u>
 for this year is to <u>exert efforts to resolutely overcome</u>
 unhealthy practices and to <u>push forward the building</u>
 of <u>clean and honest</u>
 government.</p>
<p>B: This year <i>we must concentrate on overcoming</i>
 unhealthy practices and <i>on building (or:</i>
 strengthening) <i>clean</i>
 government.</p>
<p>[-As soon as she read this sentence, the polisher knew that her chief task would be to clear away the underbrush that nearly obscured the meaning. It was not hard to do. In rapid succession she made the following revisions.</p>
<p>-She changed the unnec. verb + noun construction "to exert efforts" to its plain-verb equivalent, "to try" : "The focus of work for this year is to try to resolutely overcome... ."Then, seeing that "to try" added nothing but more words, she deleted it.</p>
<p>-She deleted the all-purpose adverb "resolutely," which added nothing useful.</p>
<p>-She replaced the static abstraction "The focus of work is to overcome" with a strong verb, "we must concentrate on overcoming."</p>
<p>-Since in this context "push forward the building of" meant no more than "build," she dispensed with "push forward."</p>
<p>-"Clean" and "honest" being redundant twins (one word was only a metaphor for the other), she deleted "honest."</p>
<p>-Thus, she reduced 26 words to 14, highlighting the sense.]</p>
