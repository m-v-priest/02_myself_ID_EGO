<title>XI. Parallel Structure</title>
</head>
<body style="font-family:cnepub,serif;">
<h2>XI. Parallel Structure</h2>
<p>Parallel structure—that is, the expression of matching ideas in matching form—is one of the most basic and valuable stylistic devices in English. Not only does it satisfy the desire for order and balance, but at its best, by highlighting the connection between ideas, it can give the reader a fresh perception of them, summed up with great economy and force.</p>
<p>Many of the most memorable lines in English, from the humblest folk sayings to the most highly polished literary passages, owe their enduring power to the parallel statement of parallel thoughts. Some of the following examples will no doubt be familiar to Chinese students of English (they are identified in the numbered footnotes below):</p>
<p><a id="a1"></a>
 - A penny saved is a penny earned. <a href="text00016.html#b1">
<sup>1</sup>
</a>
 -<a id="a2"></a>
 Where there's a will there's a way. <a href="text00016.html#b2">
<sup>2</sup>
</a>
 -<a id="a3"></a>
 To be, or not to be: that is the question.... <a href="text00016.html#b3">
<sup>3</sup>
</a>
 -<a id="a4"></a>
 Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise. <a href="text00016.html#b4">
<sup>4</sup>
</a>
 -Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen nineteen six, result happiness.<a id="a5"></a>
 Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six, result misery. <a href="text00016.html#b5">
<sup>5</sup>
</a>
 -Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it,<a id="a6"></a>
 Almighty God. I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!<a href="text00016.html#b6">
<sup>6</sup>
</a>
 -We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their creator with<a id="a7"></a>
 certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.... <a href="text00016.html#b7">
<sup>7</sup>
</a>
 -It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this nation, under God,<a id="a8"></a>
 shall have a new birth of freedom; and that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth. <a href="text00016.html#b8">
<sup>8</sup>
</a>
 -To have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse,<a id="a9"></a>
 for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part. <a href="text00016.html#b9">
<sup>9</sup>
</a>
 -Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.</p>
<p><a id="a10"></a>
 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. <a href="text00016.html#b10">
<sup>10</sup>
</a>
 To native speakers of English most of these proverbs and quotations are so well known that their form is taken for granted, as if it were inevitable. Yet in each case it would be perfectly possible to express the same meaning in a different way. For example:</p>
<p>- A penny saved is the same as if you had earned it.</p>
<p>-To be, or to cease living: that is the question....</p>
<p>-... that among these are the rights to life, liberty, and to pursue happiness....</p>
<p>-... that government of the people, exercised by themselves and for their own benefit, shall not perish from the earth.</p>
<p>-Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>People who are in mourning are blessed, because comfort will be given them.</p>
<p>Meek people are blessed too, for they shall inherit the earth.</p>
<p>In these alternative versions the sense remains intact. Nothing is missing except parallel structure—nothing, that is, except the conciseness, the energy, the rhythm, and the symmetry that have imprinted the originals on the minds of countless generations.</p>
<p>These few examples will suffice to indicate the grace and strength that the use of parallel structure brings to speech and writing of the most varied kinds. But in addition to the eloquence it can sometimes achieve, parallel structure has another virtue, one that is probably of greater everyday utility to Chinese translators: it is a wonderful aid to clarity.</p>
<p>When two or more matching elements in a sentence are presented in matching grammatical form, it is easier for the reader to recognize the logical relations between them.</p>
<p>As can be seen from the examples above, this principle applies equally to elements of any length or grammatical category:</p>
<p>- words: <u>healthy</u>
 , <u>wealthy</u>
 , and <u>wise</u>
 . A series of three single adjectives, all modifying "man."</p>
<p>-phrases: <u>of the people</u>
 , <u>by the people</u>
 , and <u>for the people</u>
 . Three prepositional phrases of equal length, all modifying "government," the parallelism being reinforced by the repetition of the same word ("people") as the object in each.</p>
<p>-clauses: <u>Where there's a will</u>
 <u>there's a way</u>
 . A pair of short independent clauses constructed on the same pattern ("there's an x" /"there's a y"), the parallelism being underlined by alliteration ("will" /"way").</p>
<p>-sentences: <u>Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen nineteen six, result happiness</u>
 . <u>Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six, result misery</u>
 . Two sentences of almost the same length and exactly the same pattern ("if annual income is x and annual expenditure is y, the result is z"). The parallelism between the two is heightened by the use of identical words ("Annual income twenty pounds," "annual expenditure," "result") and opposite words ("happiness" / "misery").</p>
<p>In each of these examples, what Wilson Follett [p. 211] calls "putting like thoughts into like constructions" ensures that the form of the utterance illuminates its content. A pair or a series of elements that are to be understood as parallel in meaning are presented to the reader in parallel grammatical form. Their structural similarity brings out their logical similarity, inviting ready comprehension.</p>
<p>In Chapter IX, The Placement of Phrases and Clauses, we saw how a translator could clarify the logic and emphasis of a sentence by placing certain elements in the right order. Parallelism is a way of achieving that same lucidity by placing certain elements in the right structure.</p>
<h3 id="c1">Difficulties in using parallel structure</h3>
<p>In his <i>Handbook of Good English</i>
 [p. 15], the experienced American book editor Edward Johnson declares that “[c]orrecting faulty parallelism occupies more of an editor's attention than correcting all other grammatical faults put together."</p>
<p>That is not true for editors of Chinglish texts, which—understandably—contain more grammatical errors than would normally be found in manuscripts submitted to a New York publishing house. Still, the remark calls attention to the ease with which even native speakers of English can make mistakes when attempting (or neglecting) parallel structure.</p>
<p>Parallelism is either required, desirable, or possible in a great variety of situations, each affording opportunities for error. Follett [p. 211] warns of "a labyrinth of ways to go wrong," and not all of those ways are easy to recognize.</p>
<p>We shall not attempt to survey here the entire terrain of parallel structure and all the pitfalls with which it is riddled. For our purposes, it will suffice to concentrate on those areas in which parallelism is virtually mandatory and on those potential missteps that have proved most hazardous to Chinese.</p>
<p>The constructions we shall consider are those in which:</p>
<p>1. sentence elements are linked by one of the <u>coordinating conjunctions</u>
 ("and," "or," etc. )</p>
<p>2. elements are linked by one of the so-called <u>correlative conjunctions</u>
 ("both... and," "not only... but also," etc. )</p>
<p>3. items appear in the form of <u>a list or a series of headings</u>
 (e. g., subtitles in a report)</p>
<p>4. elements are linked in <u>comparisons</u>
</p>
<h3 id="c2">1. Elements linked by coordinating conjunctions</h3>
<p>The chief coordinating conjunctions, you will remember, are "and," "or" /"nor," and "but."(The others—"for," "so," and "yet"—have more limited uses and are far less common. ) These conjunctions connect words or groups of words that perform the same grammatical <i>function</i>
 in the sentence.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>- On Mount Emei it starts snowing in late October <u>or</u>
 early November, <u>and</u>
 it does not stop until April.</p>
<p>"Late October" and "early November," connected by "or," both serve as objects of the preposition "in."The two parts of the sentence connected by "and" are both independent clauses.</p>
<p>A more complex example:</p>
<p>- Li said that China <u>and</u>
 [1] the Netherlands shared many common views on safeguarding world peace, promoting economic development, <u>and</u>
 [2] enhancing cooperation <u>and</u>
 [3] exchanges, despite differences in historical <u>and</u>
 [4] cultural background <u>and</u>
 [5] level of development.</p>
<p>Of the five "and" s in this sentence, #1 joins two subjects of the dependent "that" clause; #2 joins three objects of the preposition "on" ; #3 joins two objects of the gerund "enhancing" ; #4 joins two modifiers of the noun "background" ; and #5 joins two objects of the preposition "in."</p>
<p>The elements linked by a coordinating conjunction are necessarily parallel in <i>meaning</i>
 . (Here, of course, "parallel" does not mean "the same" : the two clauses in "give me liberty or give me death" have quite different meanings, but the meanings are parallel. ) In the example just given, "China" is parallel to "the Netherlands; "safeguarding world peace," "promoting economic development" and "enhancing cooperation and exchanges" are all parallel; and so on.</p>
<p>Since the function and meaning of coordinate elements are parallel, it follows that, for logic and clarity, they should be expressed in parallel <i>form</i>
 . There are degrees of parallelism, and perfect symmetry is both rarely achieved and rarely necessary. But at a minimum, parallel form means that the words or groups of words in a pair must belong to <u>the same grammatical category</u>
 .</p>
<p>To begin with, single words should not be paired with phrases or clauses. In addition, if the elements joined are words, they must both be the same part of speech—nouns, adjectives, etc. ; if phrases, both of the same type—infinitive, participial, etc. ; if clauses, both of the same rank—independent (main) or dependent (subordinate). The same is true when there are three or more items in a series: all must be of the same kind.</p>
<p>If we return to our second example, we find that this rule has been observed. Each pair or series consists of items in the same grammatical category:</p>
<p>-Li said that China <u>and</u>
 [1] the Netherlands shared many common views on safeguarding world peace, promoting economic development <u>and</u>
 [2] enhancing cooperation <u>and</u>
 [3] exchanges despite differences in historical <u>and</u>
 [4] cultural background <u>and</u>
 [5] level of development.</p>
<p>In the pair joined by "and" #1, both words are nouns ("China" /"the Netherlands"). In the series joined by #2, all three elements are gerund phrases("safeguarding. . ."/"promoting. . ."/"enhancing. . ."). The pair joined by #3 are both nouns ("cooperation" /"exchanges"), the pair joined by #4 are both adjectives ("historical" /"cultural") and the pair joined by #5 are again both nouns ("background" /"level"). Form matches function, and both are matched to meaning.</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Examples of mismatched elements</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>In the A-versions of the following sentences, the parallelism is faulty because the elements linked by the coordinating conjunctions belong to <u>different grammatical categories</u>
 . In other words, we have parallel function and parallel meaning, but not parallel form.</p>
<p>Consciously or unconsciously, readers expect a sequence of comparable terms, and when their expectation is disappointed, the effect is jarring. The B-versions, by making the terms grammatically consistent, smooth out the bumps in the road.</p>
<p>A: Also to be coordinated [between Hong Kong and Guangdong] are <u>water supply</u>
 , <u>security</u>
 , and <u>how to move people</u>
 and trucks across the border more efficiently. (Noun + noun + infinitive phrase. )</p>
<p>B: Also to be coordinated are <i>water supply, security,</i>
 and efficient <i>movement</i>
 of people and trucks across the border. (Three nouns. )</p>
<p>A: Whether reunification can be brought about smoothly will be determined by two factors. One is the <u>result</u>
 of the practice of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong, and the other is <u>whether we can make a breakthrough</u>
 in economic development. (Noun + dependent clause. )</p>
<p>B: Whether reunification can be brought about smoothly will be determined by two factors. One is <i>how well the "one country, two systems" formula is applied</i>
 in Hong Kong, and the other is <i>how successful we are</i>
 in developing the economy. (Two dependent clauses. )</p>
<p>A: Timber is needed <u>for construction</u>
 and <u>to withstand</u>
 floods. (Prepositional phrase + infinitive phrase. )</p>
<p>B: Timber is needed <i>to provide</i>
 material for construction and <i>to help withstand</i>
 floods. (Two infinitive phrases. )</p>
<p>A: They [mainland educators] also expect their Taiwan counterparts in education to edit textbooks to follow the principle of <u>seeking</u>
 truth from facts, <u>being</u>
 responsible for the young and for the future of the Chinese nation, and <u>safeguard</u>
 the unification of the motherland. (Gerund phrase + gerund phrase + verb. )</p>
<p>B: They also expect their Taiwan counterparts to edit textbooks in accordance with the principles of <i>seeking</i>
 truth from facts, <i>being</i>
 responsible for the young and for the future of the Chinese nation, and <i>safeguarding</i>
 the unification of the motherland. (Three gerund phrases. )</p>
<p>A: Adhering to the principles of <u>integrating</u>
 Marxism-Leninism with the realities of the Chinese revolution, <u>seeking</u>
 truth from facts, and the <u>mass line</u>
 , the Party skillfully wielded the two weapons—the United Front and armed struggle. (Gerund phrase + gerund phrase + noun. )</p>
<p>B: Adhering to the principles of <i>integrating</i>
 Marxism-Leninism with the realities of the Chinese revolution, <i>seeking</i>
 truth from facts, and <i>following</i>
 the mass line, the Party skillfully wielded two weapons: the united front and armed struggle. (Three gerund phrases. )</p>
<p>In each of these examples, one of the disparate elements has been changed to conform to the other(s). That is the usual remedy for mismatched elements and the first you should try.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, the items in a pair or series cannot readily be made compatible. If you find that reducing them to the same grammatical form produces a sentence that is awkward and unnatural, it may be that they are not logically comparable after all. In that case, it is best to abandon the attempt at parallelism and try another construction.</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>A note about mixing nouns and gerunds</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>In the last example above—“<u>integrating</u>
 Marxism-Leninism with the realities of the Chinese revolution, <u>seeking</u>
 truth from facts and the <u>mass line</u>
 ”—we had two gerunds followed by a noun. In this instance, a third gerund is plainly needed: readers expect one, and without it there would be nothing but an easily ignored comma to prevent them from thinking that the Party was seeking truth from facts and from the mass line.</p>
<p>But because gerunds and ordinary nouns are so closely related, they can sometimes work together without creating the jarring effect of more obvious mismatches. In the following sentence, for example, although the series is noun + gerund + noun, the reader is not aware of any discrepancy between the terms:</p>
<p>-Local financial and economic departments throughout the country were demanding that the <u>regulation</u>
 , <u>planning</u>
 and <u>administration</u>
 of many matters be centralized as well.</p>
<p>This means that when nouns and gerunds are mixed, the combination may or may not be acceptable. Once again, a matter of judgment.</p>
<h3 id="c3">2. Elements linked by correlative conjunctions</h3>
<p>The so-called correlative conjunctions are connectives that work together in pairs. The following are the most common:</p>
<p>-both... and</p>
<p>-either... or</p>
<p>-neither... nor</p>
<p>-not... but</p>
<p>-not only... but also</p>
<p>In these combinations, the first word announces what is coming next: two equivalent terms joined by a coordinating conjunction. By specifically drawing attention to the parallelism ahead, it sets up in the reader's mind an inevitable expectation. In effect, that first word is an implied commitment to the reader that whatever element comes after will be followed by a suitable mate.</p>
<p>Wilson Follett puts it unequivocally. Speaking of the constructions "either... or" ("neither... nor") and "not only... but also" [p. 212], he says, "If any two verbal formulas are hard-and-fast promises of parallel construction, [these] are such promises."And referring to "both... and" [p. 91], he warns, "If what follows <i>and</i>
 is not the logical and rhetorical equivalent of what follows <i>both,</i>
 the result is disappointment or shock."</p>
<p>Thus, when correlative conjunctions are used, it is particularly important that the terms they connect be strictly parallel. The grammatical construction following the second conjunction must correspond exactly to the one following the first.</p>
<p>Here are two examples of sentences that violate the rule, together with proposed revisions:</p>
<p>A: The delegates [to a conference on meat production] agreed that these are vital issues for the next century, both <u>for people's quality of life</u>
 and <u>for saving</u>
 the environment. (Preposition/noun + preposition/gerund. )</p>
<p>B: The delegates agreed that these are vital issues for the next century, affecting both <i>the quality of people's lives</i>
 and <i>the preservation of the environment.</i>
 (Two nouns, each modified by a matching prepositional phrase. )</p>
<p>A: This will help the authorities set prices that are appropriate not only <u>for</u>
 their own localities but also <u>in relation to</u>
 prices throughout the country. ("For x" + "in relation to y.")</p>
<p>B: This will help the authorities set prices that are appropriate not only <i>in relation to</i>
 their own local conditions but also <i>in relation to</i>
 prices throughout the country. ("In relation to x" /"in relation to y.")</p>
<h3 id="c4">3. Items in a list or a series of headings</h3>
<p>Another formula that some authorities include in lists of correlative conjunctions is "first... second... third.""First" is certainly a promise of at least a "second" to come, and that second item and any others following must be in matching form. Here is an example of the expected pattern:</p>
<p>- Socialism has two major requirements. First, <u>its economy must be dominated by public ownership</u>
 , and second, <u>there must be no polarization</u>
 . (Two independent clauses; in addition, both are based on the verb "must be.")</p>
<p>The same principle applies when the items are presented not in a single sentence but in the form of a list. Here, however, is a list in which not one of the three items matches either of the others:</p>
<p>-Jiang said that... the Party should now concentrate on the following three aspects:</p>
<p>First, the whole <u>Party must keep</u>
 its ideological and political unity....</p>
<p>Second, the <u>unity</u>
 of the Party in organization and action <u>to be enhanced</u>
 through implementing democratic centralism.</p>
<p>Third, <u>strengthen</u>
 further the close relationship between the Party and the people, putting the struggle against corruption at the top of the agenda.</p>
<p>The first item in this series is an independent clause with an ordinary indicative verb in active voice ("must keep"). The second is not a clause at all but a "headline" having no verb except an infinitive ("to be"), which cannot stand alone. The third is again an independent clause, but this time the verb is in the imperative ("strengthen").</p>
<p>The translator's uncertainty is reflected in the introductory statement. We are told that according to Jiang, the Party should concentrate on three "aspects," but the question "aspects of what?" remains unanswered. Admittedly, it is hard to know just what a free-floating "aspect" is and what form it should take. Still, whatever form is decided upon must be used consistently.</p>
<p>Here is a tentative proposal for a revision:</p>
<p>-Jiang said that... the Party should now concentrate on the following three tasks (endeavors? goals?):</p>
<p>First, <i>it must maintain</i>
 its ideological and political unity....</p>
<p>Second, <i>it must enhance</i>
 its unity in organization and action by implementing democratic centralism.</p>
<p>Third, <i>it must strengthen</i>
 its close relations with the people, placing the struggle against corruption at the top of its agenda.</p>
<p>Instead of being introduced by "first," "second," "third," etc., the successive points may be marked “1... 2... 3” or "a)... b)... c)," or they may appear without any indication of sequence at all. But even if the numbering is only implied, logic demands that all the points be cast in similar constructions.</p>
<p>Like items in a list, a series of subtitles in a document or of chapter headings in a book are essentially coordinate and should be parallel in form. Even if they are not numbered, and even if they are widely separated, the reader expects them to be consistent and finds it disconcerting and confusing if they are not.</p>
<p>For instance, if one section of a government report is entitled "<u>Seizing</u>
 the Opportunity to Speed up Economic Development" (gerund phrase), corresponding later sections should not be headed "<u>Accelerate</u>
 the Reform and <u>Open</u>
 Wider to the Outside World" (independent clause with imperative verbs), or "<u>We must Create</u>
 a Better Social and Political Environment for Economic Development" (independent clause with indicative verb). Once the pattern is set, it should be followed: "<i>Seizing</i>
 the Opportunity... ," "<i>Accelerating</i>
 the Reform and <i>Opening Wider... ," and "Creating</i>
 a Better Social and Political Environment... ."</p>
<h3 id="c5">4. Elements linked in comparisons</h3>
<p>Items that are being compared (or contrasted) are linked not by conjunctions but by such words as "like" or "unlike," "as much as," "the same as," "different from," "greater than," "less desirable than," "more rapidly than," and so on. By definition, elements in a comparison should be parallel <i>logically</i>
 ; otherwise, the comparison is false.</p>
<p>For example, in the last chapter (page 304) we cited the following sentence:</p>
<p>A: Just <u>like the Crowne Plaza</u>
 , <u>all rooms</u>
 feature an electronic door lock, a private safe, two telephones with IDD....</p>
<p>B: <i>Like the rooms</i>
 in the Crowne Plaza, <i>all those</i>
 in the Holiday Inn feature an electronic door lock, a private safe, two telephones with IDD....</p>
<p>The error here was identified as a dangling prepositional phrase ("like the Crowne Plaza") that was not logically attached to the subject of the sentence ("all rooms"). But it can also be described as a failure of parallelism. The two elements are similar from the point of view of grammar (they are both nouns), but not from the point of view of logic (you cannot compare a hotel with rooms in another hotel). In the revision rooms were compared with rooms.</p>
<p>When comparisons are faulty, it is usually, as in this instance, because the items involved are not parallel logically. Consequently, the meaning of the sentence is obscured or perverted. But it can also be a problem when the items are not parallel grammatically. The meaning generally survives, but again, the reader's expectations are frustrated.</p>
<p>By way of illustration of the correct structure, following are some typical comparisons in which the two elements in question are expressed in the anticipated matching form:</p>
<p>-She did not like <u>revising</u>
 as much as <u>translating</u>
 .</p>
<p>-She thought it was more creative <u>to translate</u>
 than <u>to revise</u>
 the work of others.</p>
<p>-She was less willing to take on a <u>revision</u>
 than a <u>translation</u>
 .</p>
<p>-She was no more able <u>to give up working</u>
 than <u>to stop eating</u>
 .</p>
<p>-She was <u>transferred</u>
 from another unit rather than <u>promoted</u>
 from inside. (Not, as is often written: rather than being promoted. )</p>
<p>-No sooner had <u>she arrived</u>
 at her new post than <u>she set to work</u>
 .</p>
<p>Note that parallel structure is not equally essential in all these patterns. For example, in the first one, if the gerund "revising" were matched not with another gerund but with a noun, "translation," the reader might slide over the discrepancy without any sense of a disappointed expectation.</p>
<p>In the last one, however, the opening formula, "<u>No sooner had x happened</u>
 ," commits the writer to one particular, predictable course. It can be completed <i>only</i>
 by "<u>than y happened</u>
 ."If it were followed by any other construction, the writer would be guilty of a broken promise, and the reader would feel betrayed.</p>
<h3 id="c6">Further refinements</h3>
<p>As stated at the outset of this discussion, the matching of grammatical categories in a pair or series is only a minimal requirement of parallel structure. If the meaning calls for it, further refinements can create a closer, more effective parallelism.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the following sentence:</p>
<p>-<u>Should we follow a policy that will</u>
 not help us shake off poverty and backwardness, or <u>should we</u>
 , on the basis of those four principles, <u>choose a better policy that will</u>
 enable us to rapidly develop the productive forces?</p>
<p>The two elements linked by the coordinating conjunction "or" are both independent clauses, as required by the rule of matching categories. Both are interrogative. (It would be impossible to construct an English sentence beginning with a question followed by "or" in which the second clause was not also a question. ) This much is essential.</p>
<p>But other aspects of the sentence are also matching:</p>
<p>-the two clauses have the same subject ("we")</p>
<p>-each is based on a verb in active voice ("follow" /"choose"), so that each has the same internal pattern ("should we do x?" / "should we do y?")</p>
<p>-each verb has an object, and the two objects are the same ("policy")</p>
<p>-each object is modified by a dependent clause beginning with "that"</p>
<p>-the two dependent clauses have contrasting but similar patterns (“that <i>will</i>
 not help us do x" /“that <i>will</i>
 enable us to do y”)</p>
<p>These additional likenesses of form and language create a tighter parallelism than is strictly necessary, but one that is highly effective. It clarifies the speaker's thought—the comparison of two possible courses of action—and despite the reference to the four cardinal principles, which somewhat breaks the rhythm, it is satisfying to the ear.</p>
<p>We shall look first at ways of enhancing parallel structure beyond the minimum, in places where parallelism is clearly required. Then, at ways of introducing parallelism in places—between two sentences, for example—where it is desirable even if not obligatory.</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Nouns</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>Nouns in a pair or series will work better together if they are of the same order of ideas—either abstract or concrete. For example:</p>
<p>-In the protracted struggle against ruthless oppression by <u>imperialism</u>
 , Kuomintang <u>bandits</u>
 and feudal <u>landlords</u>
 , the people in the old base areas made the greatest contributions to the revolution....</p>
<p>The sentence is clear and grammatical, and the series of nouns satisfies the basic demand of parallel structure. But it mixes an abstraction ("imperialism") with two concrete nouns representing persons ("bandits" and "landlords"). The series would be smoother—more "parallel"—if all three were of the same nature:</p>
<p>-In the long struggle against ruthless oppression by <i>imperialists,</i>
 Kuomintang <i>bandits</i>
 , and feudal <i>landlords,</i>
 the people in the old base areas made the greatest contributions to the revolution....</p>
<p>Another example:</p>
<p>-Since the end of July the amount of money in circulation has increased, owing to factors such as the <u>expansion</u>
 of the territory under our control, the <u>diversion</u>
 of more bank notes to the countryside, increased farm <u>produce</u>
 , and the <u>recovery</u>
 of industry and commerce.</p>
<p>At first sight the series seems unobjectionable. But a careful reader will notice that the items are not of the same order. "Expansion," "diversion" and "recovery" are abstract terms, but "produce" ("increased" or not) is concrete. Better to make the four items match more closely:</p>
<p>-Since the end of July the amount of money in circulation has increased, owing to such factors as the <i>expansion</i>
 of the territory under our control, the <i>diversion</i>
 of more bank notes to the countryside, an <i>increase</i>
 in farm production, and the <i>recovery</i>
 of industry and commerce.</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Verbs</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>Two verbs in the same sentence will be more symmetrical if they are both in the same voice. The following sentence, for example, meets the minimum standard, because the two elements joined by "and" are both independent clauses:</p>
<p>-China's foreign policy <u>is known</u>
 to all, and it <u>will remain</u>
 unchanged.</p>
<p>But from the point of view of parallel structure, the sentence would be improved if both verbs were either passive or active:</p>
<p>-China's foreign policy <i>is known</i>
 to all, and it <i>will not be changed.</i>
 Or:</p>
<p>-Everyone <i>knows</i>
 China's foreign policy, and it <i>will remain unchanged.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Phrases</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>Phrases will be better balanced if each of the pair or series follows the same internal pattern. For example, the following series is acceptable because each of the items is a noun:</p>
<p>-Simultaneous with that is the <u>allocation of land</u>
 , <u>rent reduction</u>
 , and <u>wage increases</u>
 ....</p>
<p>But a closer match can be achieved by giving the three word groups the same structure:</p>
<p>-Simultaneous with that is the <i>allocation of land, reduction of rents,</i>
 and <i>increase in wages....</i>
</p>
<p>[<u>Review</u>
 : A translator mindful of the noun plague might prefer to recast the sentence using verbs, with no loss of parallelism: "At the same time, land <i>is being distributed,</i>
 rents <i>are being reduced</i>
 and wages <i>are being increased.”]</i>
</p>
<p>As we saw above in the opening example ("Should we follow a policy. . ."), another means of heightening parallelism between word groups is repetition of wording. For instance:</p>
<p>-<u>From their point of view</u>
 [that of the local authorities], many projects for meeting local needs are primary, but <u>in view of the overall interest</u>
 , they are often regarded as secondary and can be postponed.</p>
<p>Again, the sentence is tolerable (barely), but a neater and stronger version can be produced by repeating the same wording:</p>
<p>-<i>From their point of view</i>
 many projects designed to meet local needs are of primary importance, but <i>from the overall point of view</i>
 it is quite possible that they are secondary and can be postponed.</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Clauses</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>The same principles apply to clauses. Consider again the example of a mismatched noun and clause given above:</p>
<p>-Whether reunification can be brought about smoothly will be determined by two factors. One is the <u>result</u>
 of the practice of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong, and the other is <u>whether we can make a breakthrough</u>
 in economic development.</p>
<p>In principle, to match the two elements it would have been sufficient to change the noun "result" to another dependent clause:</p>
<p>-Whether reunification can be brought about smoothly will be determined by two factors. One is <u>how well the "one country, two systems" formula is applied</u>
 in Hong Kong, and the other is <u>whether we can make a breakthrough</u>
 in economic development.</p>
<p>But we can achieve greater clarity and a more satisfying balance by repeating the pattern of the first clause in the second:</p>
<p>-Whether reunification can be brought about smoothly will be determined by two factors. One is <i>how well the "one country, two systems" formula is applied</i>
 in Hong Kong, and the other is <i>how successful we are</i>
 in developing the economy.</p>
<p>Here is another example of two clauses whose parallel meaning can be better brought out if they are given the same structure:</p>
<p>-<u>In late 1948</u>
 Shanghai had a population of 5. 05 million, according to statistics, and the figure rose to 5. 5 million <u>by the end of last May</u>
 .</p>
<p>A simple change of word order will bring the two phrases into alignment so that they occupy the same position in their respective clauses:</p>
<p>-According to statistics, <i>in late 1948</i>
 Shanghai had a population of 5. 05 million, and <i>by the end of last May</i>
 the figure had risen to 5. 5 million.</p>
<p>[<u>Review</u>
 : Moving "by the end of last May" to the beginning of its clause has the further advantage of leaving the emphatic end-position to the main point—the new higher figure.]</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Sentences</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>So far we have looked at examples of parallel structure only within single sentences. But sometimes you may wish to introduce a degree of parallelism into two separate but consecutive sentences.</p>
<p>The means are the same as those just described: to emphasize the correspondence between significant phrases or clauses, you can repeat the same pattern and language in both sentences.</p>
<p>Following is an example in which two key phrases virtually cry out for parallel form:</p>
<p>-<u>Only by resisting</u>
 the Japanese for a long time <u>could the people</u>
 in the occupied areas gain a better understanding of the war and enhance their sense of organization and the need to gradually expand their forces. <u>Without waging</u>
 an extensive people's war in the rear areas of the enemy, <u>it would be impossible for China</u>
 to win the final victory in the war against Japan.</p>
<p>Here the patterns of the two sentences are:</p>
<p>-only by doing x could the people do y</p>
<p>-without doing x it would be impossible for China to do y.</p>
<p>To make the sentences parallel we have only to change the second to match the pattern of the first:</p>
<p>-only by doing x could the people do y</p>
<p>-only by doing x could China do y.</p>
<p>These changes produce:</p>
<p>-<i>Only by resisting</i>
 the Japanese for a long time <i>could the people</i>
 in the occupied areas gain a better understanding of the war and become fully aware of the need to organize themselves and gradually expand their forces. And <i>only by waging</i>
 a large-scale people's war in the enemy's rear areas <i>could China</i>
 win final victory.</p>
<p>[<u>Review</u>
 : "Enhance their sense of organization" was spelled out as "become fully aware of the need to organize themselves."Thus a vague structure based on two abstract nouns, "sense" and "organization," was turned into a plain statement based on an adjective, "aware," and a strong verb, "organize.""In the war with Japan" was dropped as self-evident.]</p>
<p>Now an example in which two sentences would make the speaker's point more effectively if they were couched in the same language:</p>
<p>-The Central Government certainly will not intervene in the day-to-day affairs of the Special Administrative Region, nor is that necessary. But <u>is it not true that something could occur in the region that might jeopardize the fundamental interests</u>
 of the country? Couldn't such a situation arise? If this happens, should Beijing interfere? <u>Is it not possible that something could happen in Hong Kong that would harm the fundamental interests</u>
 of Hong Kong itself?</p>
<p>In this instance the two patterns are already the same:</p>
<p>-is it not true that something could occur in the region that might jeopardize the fundamental interests of x?</p>
<p>-is it not possible that something could happen in Hong Kong that would harm the fundamental interests of y?</p>
<p>But the difference in wording only diminishes the intended parallel between the two situations. It is easy enough to make identical pairs out of "true" /"possible," "occur" /"happen" and "jeopardize" /"harm."This is the result:</p>
<p>-The Central Government certainly will not intervene in the day-to-day affairs of the Special Administrative Region, nor is that necessary. But <i>isn't it possible that something could happen</i>
 in the region that might <i>jeopardize</i>
 the fundamental interests of the country? Couldn't such a situation arise? If that happened, should Beijing intervene or not? <i>Isn't it possible that something could happen</i>
 there that would <i>jeopardize</i>
 the fundamental interests of Hong Kong itself?</p>
<p>[<u>Review</u>
 : In the last sentence "in Hong Kong" was replaced by "there" to avoid an unnecessary duplication. Unlike the deliberate repetitions, a second mention of "Hong Kong" would add nothing to parallel structure.]</p>
<h3 id="c7">Misleading parallel structure</h3>
<p>Follett tells us [p. 212] that “[w]hat is fatal is to arouse an expectation of matched constructions and then to frustrate it."But what is equally fatal is to use matched constructions for elements that do not, in fact, match. Either failing gives the impression of a disorderly mind at work.</p>
<p>When parallel structure is imposed on elements that are not logically parallel, the result is always startling (eg, "Just like the Crowne Plaza, all rooms . . ."). Sometimes it can be deliberately humorous. Johnson [p. 9] cites the false parallels "He took his hat and his leave" and "He bolted his door and his dinner."He implies that no one, without comic intent, would write, "He keeps fit, sheep, and his word."</p>
<p>But most often a logical mismatch is inadvertent. H. Ramsey Fowler and Jane E. Aaron [p. 354] quote a misleading construction in which a writer has unwittingly suggested a similarity where there is none:</p>
<p>-The painting has subdued tone, great feeling, and a length of about three feet.</p>
<p>And Claire Cook [p. 67] offers this thought-provoking parallel, which could hardly have been intentional:</p>
<p>-The police found no alcohol in his bloodstream but a loaded gun in his car.</p>
<p>Jacques Barzun and Henry F. Graff [p. 275], insisting, like Follett, that a parallel construction once begun should always be carried through, nevertheless emphasize that the construction should not be entered upon in the first place unless it is logically justified. "Parallelism," they say, "is so important a device in writing that its use must be kept pure. Do not give parallel forms to disparate ideas... ."</p>
<p>If you remember that bit of advice, you will avoid the mistake made by the French veteran of the Napoleonic wars who recounted that he had been wounded three times: once in an ambush, once in the leg, and once in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>-In addition, the first three elements ("performing," "exhibition," "shopping") are abstract words representing activities, while the fourth ("restaurant") is a concrete word designating a place. (If the last word had matched the first three—"dining," for example—the combination of nouns and gerunds might have been tolerable. )</p>
<p>-In the revision all four elements have been made concrete nouns naming various places.</p>

 under the heat of the midsummer sun, <u>fatigue</u>

 in battles and <u>deserters</u>
 during the march.</p>
<p>B: Their numbers were now greatly reduced because of battlefield <i>casualties, desertions</i>
 , and the <i>exhaustion</i>
 of constant marching under a blazing midsummer sun.</p>
<p>[-This time, in A-version the series is composed entirely of nouns, if we include the past participle "wounded," which can act as a noun (cf. "the injured," "the unemployed," etc. ). But the nouns are not comparable.</p>
<p>-The first two—“march(ing)” and "fatigue"—are not parallel, because the second is not a separate hazard but a consequence of the first.</p>
<p>-The last three—"deaths," "the wounded," and "deserters"—should logically be either "deaths" /"wounds" /"desertions" (three causes of loss) or "the dead" /"the wounded" /"the deserters" (three types of people). And so on.</p>
<p>-In B-version "march" and "fatigue" were combined in a single phrase showing the relation between them ("the exhaustion of constant marching"). "Deaths" and "the wounded" were collapsed into one word ("casualties").</p>
<p>-The causes enumerated were thus reduced from five mismatched terms to three that were relatively consistent: "casualties," "desertions," and "exhaustion."]</p>

 and <i>regulations,</i>
 and <i>lists of taxable items</i>
 have been promulgated; and because the mainland has been liberated, tax receipts have been greater than they were last year <i>(or:</i>
 than last year's).</p>
<p>[-The three subjects of the second clause in A-version are again all nouns, but again they are not of the same order.</p>
<p>-"Regulations" and "rates" are abstract, but taxable "items" (physical objects, like salt or vehicle licenses) are concrete and, unlike the other two, cannot be "promulgated" (i. e., announced or proclaimed).</p>
<p>-In B-version the abstract word "lists" was introduced to solve this problem.</p>

<p>B: But even so, it will be hard to <i>prevent expenditure from exceeding revenue and to keep revenue from falling,</i>
 and other factors, such as a grain shortage, may also drive prices up.</p>
<p>[-In A-version the two objects of "prevent" are not of the same grammatical category: the first ("expenditure from exceeding revenue") is a whole phrase, while the second ("a fall") is a single noun.</p>
<p>-In the revision the two objects were separated and given separate verbs. That made it possible to establish a new and exact parallel between "prevent expenditure from exceeding" and "keep revenue from falling."</p>

 : In the interest of replacing a weak noun construction with a strong verb, "contribute to price rise" was changed to "drive prices up.")]</p>
<p>6) A: Last month I went to Tingzhou and did the following with regard to contract negotiations [for the grocery workers there]:</p>

<p>2. <u>Relying</u>
 on the Party branch, <u>strengthening</u>
 its leadership and <u>consolidating</u>
 its organization....</p>
<p>3. The negotiated contract <u>should be</u>
 realistic and flexible, as required by the actual conditions of the grocery trade in Tingzhou.</p>
<p>B: Last month I went to Tingzhou and did the following with regard to contract negotiations:</p>
<p>1. First of all, <i>I tried to find out</i>
 where each enterprise actually stood, whether the contract already negotiated was being observed, and what the demands of the workers were....</p>
<p>2. <i>I relied on</i>
 the Party branch, strengthening its leadership and consolidating its organization....</p>
<p>3. <i>I made sure</i>
 that the negotiated contract was realistic and flexible and in keeping with the conditions in the grocery trade in Tingzhou.</p>
<p>[-The three items listed were separated by several pages of intervening text. That made it all the more important to present them in parallel form, so as to help the reader keep track of the speaker's argument and remember that these were all things he had done in Tingzhou.</p>
<p>-In A-version, however, the three coordinate points are inconsistent in form: (1) gerund ("studying"); (2) gerunds ("relying," "strengthening," "consolidating"); (3) verb ("should be"). Worse, none of those constructions can logically come after "I did the following."</p>
<p>-In the revision all three were cast in the same form, as active verbs with the same subject ("I tried to find out," "I relied on," "I made sure").</p>

 : "Actual" was eliminated as superfluous with "conditions.")]</p>
<p>7) A: Some intellectuals complain that our personnel contact them only on three things: namely, a <u>transfer</u>

 .</p>
<p>B: Some intellectuals complain that our people talk to them on only three occasions: <i>when they are to be transferred</i>
 to another job, <i>when their personal history is being reviewed,</i>
 and <i>when they make a mistake.</i>
</p>
<p>[-In this sentence we have what is essentially an unnumbered list of three items linked by "and."Each item, therefore, should belong to the same grammatical category, but in A-version the series is: noun + noun + subordinate clause.</p>
<p>-In the revision, all three elements are subordinate clauses. The parallelism is reinforced by the repeated use of the same conjunction ("when") and the same pattern ("when x happens").</p>
<p>-The parallelism was also increased by the change from "when a mistake is committed" to "when they make a mistake," which corresponds more closely to the shape of the two preceding clauses ("when they," "when their," "when they").</p>
<p>-("Make a mistake" was used instead of "commit a mistake" because the latter is not an idiomatic combination in English. )</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : The change in construction also served to convert two abstract nouns—"a transfer," "a review"—to verbs. Changing "when a mistake is committed" to active voice, which requires a stated subject, "they," had the further advantage of clarifying who made the mistake. )]</p>

<p>B: You have not only <i>met</i>
 Chairman Mao and <i>visited</i>
 our capital but (also) <i>witnessed the power</i>
 of our army and <i>the love</i>
 the people bear our Party and our leader.</p>
<p>[-In A-version the constructions following "not only" and "but also" do not match exactly. After the first we find "met" and "visited," after the second "have witnessed."The pattern is "You have not only x and y but also have z."</p>
<p>-To create the exact parallelism required by correlative conjunctions, the polisher deleted the "have."Thus the pattern became "You have not only x and y but also z."</p>
<p>-In A-version the two objects of "witnessed," linked by the coordinating conjunction "and," are not parallel either: a noun ("power") is matched with a noun clause ("how the people love"). In the revision the phrase was changed to another noun ("love").]</p>
<p>9) A: <u>This shows on the one hand that</u>
 China's vehicle and component industries are still highly fragmented, but <u>on the other hand it is indicative of</u>
 the enthusiasm displayed by manufacturers in trying to tap into China's rapidly expanding automotive market.</p>
<p>B: <i>This shows, on the one hand, that</i>
 China's vehicle and component industries are still highly fragmented but, <i>on the other hand, that many manufacturers are eager to tap into the rapidly expanding automotive market.</i>
</p>
<p>[-Here the elements linked by the coordinating conjunction "but" are both independent clauses. But an attentive reader will still find A-version unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>-The prepositional phrase "on the one hand" is like the first segment of a correlative conjunction in that it sets up the expectation of a partner phrase to follow. And as in the "not only... but also" example above, the element that comes after the second segment should match the one that comes after the first.</p>
<p>-In A-version that is not the case. "On the one hand" is followed by a dependent clause ("that China's vehicle and component industries are etc."), whereas "on the other hand" is followed by an independent clause ("it is indicative of etc.").</p>
<p>-In the revision the second clause was changed to a dependent clause to match the first ("that many manufacturers are . . .").</p>
<p>-An alternative solution would be to change the first clause to an independent clause to match the second. That would produce: "On the one hand this shows that... but on the other hand it indicates (<i>or:</i>
 shows) that... .”]</p>
<p>10) A: They unanimously suggested that <u>more funds should be injected</u>
 into scientific development, that <u>a more flexible system be introduced</u>
 to help the transfer of talent between economic sectors and scientific institutes, and that <u>more efforts are needed</u>
 to accelerate the transfer of the fruit of scientific research into industrial and agricultural production.</p>
<p>B: They unanimously suggested that <i>more funds should be allocated</i>
 for scientific development, that <i>a more flexible system should be introduced</i>
 to facilitate the exchange of highly trained people between economic enterprises and scientific institutes, and that <i>more efforts should be made</i>
 to ensure that the results of scientific research are rapidly applied in industry and agriculture.</p>
<p>[-Here again the basic requirement of matching grammatical categories has been met in A-version: all three elements linked by "and" are subordinate "that" clauses.</p>
<p>-But again, a critical reader will still be uncomfortable, because in other respects the three clauses are not parallel constructions. They all have different patterns: "that x should be done" /"that y be done" /"that efforts are needed to do z."</p>
<p>-In B-version the second and third clauses exactly match the pattern of the first: "that x should be done."The tighter parallelism is easy to achieve and more satisfying both to the mind and to the ear.</p>
<p>-"Economic sectors" was changed to "economic enterprises" so as not to draw a parallel between an abstract noun ("sectors") and a concrete one ("institutes").</p>
<p>-("Talent" was changed to "highly trained people" because, as mentioned in Chapter VIII, page 234, revision 13, the word is seldom used in English in a context like this. In particular, outside of show business, even "talented" people are not referred to as "talent.")]</p>
<p>11) A: If state revenue is not centralized, if state expenditure is not determined <u>in accordance with the same regulations</u>
 and <u>in observation of the principle of austerity</u>
 ... the inevitable result will be a waste of financial resources and aggravated inflation.</p>
<p>B: If control of state revenue is not centralized, and if decisions regarding state expenditures are not made <i>in accordance with a uniform set of regulations</i>
 and <i>a consistent principle of austerity</i>
 ... the inevitable result will be a waste of financial resources and aggravated inflation.</p>
<p>[-A-version is adequate, because the "and" links two prepositional phrases, but it can be tightened and improved.</p>
<p>-"In accordance with" and "in observation of" mean the same thing and serve the same function (modifying the verb "determined"), so they can be condensed into one expression. In B-version they became a single phrase, "in accordance with."</p>
<p>-"In accordance with the same regulations" raised the question "the same as what?" (presumably the same as in other places, i. e., the same everywhere, but that was not stated). The polisher therefore substituted "a uniform set of regulations."</p>
<p>-"Consistent" was then introduced ("a consistent principle of austerity"). This was done partly to clarify the meaning—which is that everything should be done everywhere in the same way, according to the same rules—and partly to heighten the parallelism by balancing "uniform" ("a uniform set of regulations").</p>
<p>-(At the beginning of the sentence "state revenue" was changed to "control of state revenue" for better logic: it is not money that is to be "centralized" but control over money. )]</p>
<p>12) A: The purpose of struggling against the KMT was not to overthrow its rule but <u>to hinder it from capitulating</u>
 to the Japanese invaders and <u>from fighting</u>
 against the Communist Party and <u>to keep it</u>
 in the anti-Japanese united front.</p>
<p>B: The purpose of struggling against the KMT was not to overthrow its rule but <i>to prevent it from capitulating</i>
 to the Japanese invaders, <i>fighting</i>
 the Communists and <i>abandoning</i>
 the anti-Japanese united front.</p>
<p>[-Here the correlative construction "not... but" is in good order, each segment being followed by an infinitive ("not to overthrow... but to hinder . . .").</p>
<p>-The coordinate construction with "and" is likewise acceptable, since the two elements joined are also both infinitives ("to hinder... and to keep"). Still, with a little revision it is possible to do better.</p>
<p>-In A-version two elements are governed by "hinder it from" ("capitulating to the invaders" and "fighting against the CP"). In B-version the third element ("to keep it in the united front") has been cast in the same form as the first two: "to hinder it from capitulating... fighting... and abandoning."</p>
<p>-As in the preceding example, the result of this condensation is not only a stronger parallelism but a neater, more concise statement.</p>
<p>-("Hinder" was changed to "prevent" simply because "prevent" was the more appropriate word. )]</p>
<p>13) A: At this meeting it was decided that <u>a part of the Red army led by Peng Dehuai and Teng Daiyuan should stay</u>
 to defend the Jinggang Mountains and that <u>Mao Zedong, Zhu De and Chen Yi should lead the main forces of the Fourth Army</u>
 , numbering 3, 600, <u>to march</u>

<p>B: At this meeting it was decided that <i>a part of the Red Army, led by Peng Dehuai and Teng Daiyuan, should stay</i>
 to defend the Jinggang Mountains, while <i>the main forces of the Fourth Army,</i>
 numbering 3, 600, <i>led by Mao Zedong, Zhu De, and Chen Yi, should march</i>
 to southern Jiangxi to launch an attack there.</p>
<p>[-In A-version the minimal demand of parallel structure is met, since the two elements joined by the coordinating conjunction "and" are both dependent clauses. It would be more satisfying, however, and easier to follow, if the missions of the two forces were expressed in more closely matching form.</p>
<p>-The pattern of the first clause is: "x troops, led by y, should do z" ; the pattern of the second is: "y should lead x troops to do z."In the revision, the second clause was rearranged to match the first: "the main forces of the Fourth Army, led by Mao et al., should march... ."</p>
<p>-(This revision had the further advantage of correcting the classic Chinglish construction "lead the main forces to march."In English you can lead people to a <u>place</u>
 , whether it is literal, like the "gate" or the "other side of the river," or metaphorical, like "victory" or a "conclusion."But, except when "lead" has the sense of "induce" or "persuade," you cannot lead them to <u>do</u>
 something—to "cross the river," to "win a victory" or to "march to southern Jiangxi.")</p>

<p>B: <i>The environment</i>
 in which we find ourselves <i>is necessarily limited, so</i>
 we should examine things from <i>different</i>
 angles. <i>Our knowledge</i>
 too <i>is necessarily limited, so</i>
 we should pay attention to <i>different</i>
 views.</p>
<p>[-The two statements are plainly parallel in meaning. A-version is grammatical, but it fails to provide parallel form and is awkward as well.</p>
<p>-In the revision both sentences have the same pattern and are based on the same key words ("x is necessarily limited" /"y is necessarily limited"), making the logical similarity clear.</p>
<p>-The incidental words in the two sentences have also been made consistent to heighten the parallelism: "invariably" / "inevitably," "so" /"therefore" and "various" /"different" have all been reduced to matching pairs.</p>
<p>-("Too" was added to express the logical connection between the two sentences. )</p>

<p>15) A: The purpose of our meeting is to end the past and open up a new era. By <u>ending</u>
 the past, I mean <u>we can leave</u>

<p>B: The purpose of our meeting is to put the past behind us and open up a new era. By <i>putting</i>
 the past behind us I mean <i>ceasing</i>
 to talk about it and <i>focusing</i>
 on the future.</p>
<p>[-In this example the wording itself suggests the need for parallel structure. The formula "by x I mean y" indicates that x and y are equivalent in the speaker's mind; accordingly, they should be expressed in equivalent form.</p>
<p>-In A-version we have a gerund phrase ("by ending the past") on one side of "I mean" and two verbs ("we can leave... and concentrate") on the other. In B-version, the sequence was changed to three gerund phrases ("by putting... I mean ceasing... and focusing . . .").</p>
<p>-("Ending the past" was changed to "putting the past behind us" not because the second expression is any more logical than the first, but because it has become idiomatic. )]</p>
<p>16) A: One-sidedness means <u>thinking</u>
 in terms of absolutes, that is, a metaphysical <u>approach</u>
 to problems.</p>
<p>B: One-sidedness means <i>thinking</i>
 in terms of absolutes, that is, <i>taking</i>
 a metaphysical approach to problems.</p>
<p>[-Here again, as in the preceding example, the wording of the sentence indicates the need for parallelism. The formula "x, that is, y" (or "x, in other words, y") is another way of telling the reader that x and y are logically equivalent.</p>
<p>-In A-version we have on one side of the equation a gerund phrase ("thinking in terms of absolutes"), and on the other a noun ("a metaphysical approach"). In the revision, a gerund was added to the second element to match the one in the first ("taking a metaphysical approach").</p>
<p>-Commenting on this example in his lectures [pp. 80－81], Professor Cheng Zhenqiu remarks that the addition of "taking" "makes the sentence more balanced."]</p>
<p>17) A: During the whole period of the War of Resistance Against Japan there existed contradictions which had an important bearing on the destiny of the Chinese nation: first, the <u>contradiction between the Chinese and the Japanese nations</u>
 , which <u>determined the survival</u>
 of the Chinese nation; second, the <u>class contradiction</u>
 which <u>determined whether</u>
 we could carry through to the very end the nationwide War of Resistance Against Japan and build a new China after the war.</p>
<p>B: Throughout the period of the War of Resistance Against Japan there were contradictions that had an important bearing on China's destiny: first, the <i>national contradiction between China and Japan,</i>
 which <i>determined whether</i>
 the Chinese nation would survive; second, the <i>class contradiction between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang,</i>
 which <i>determined whether</i>
 the people would be able to carry the War of Resistance through to the end and afterwards build a new China.</p>
<p>[-In this sentence there is a "list" of two contradictions labeled "first" and "second" ; plainly the two should be expressed in matching form. But in A-version "the contradiction between the Chinese and Japanese nations" is paired with "the class contradiction."</p>
<p>-In the revised version, material was added to each of these "contradictions" to make them match. "National" (justified by the reference to "the Chinese and Japanese nations") was added to the first, to correspond to "class" in the second.</p>
<p>-Then "between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang" (the meaning of "class" contradiction, as made clear by the context) was added to the second to correspond to "between China and Japan" in the first.</p>
<p>-To enhance the parallelism between the two items, the patterns of the two subordinate clauses ("which determined . . .") were also made to match.</p>
<p>-"Which determined the survival of the Chinese nation" in the first was changed to "which determined whether the Chinese nation would survive," corresponding to "which determined whether the people would be able to . . ."in the second.</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : As usual when a verb is introduced, the elimination of an abstract noun was a side benefit: "would survive" replaced "survival.")]</p>
<p>18) <i>Summation of a long passage describing the political maneuvering of the U. S. government and the KMT in the early 1940s:</i>
</p>
<p>A: American <u>imperialism</u>
 and <u>Chiang Kai-shek's</u>
 <u>threats and deceit</u>
 could not obstruct the advance of the Chinese people in their effort to strive for independence, democracy, and liberation.</p>
<p>B: <i>Neither the machinations</i>
 of the U. S. <i>imperialists nor the threats and deceit</i>
 of <i>Chiang Kai-shek</i>
 could halt the advance of the Chinese people in their drive for independence, democracy, and liberation.</p>
<p>[-A-version is minimally correct (the "and" links a noun with two other nouns), but it has little else to recommend it. The content of this strong summary statement calls for symmetry and force—precisely the qualities that can be provided by greater parallelism.</p>
<p>-In B-version the two elements in the compound subject have been recast in matching form. "The machinations" of the U. S. have been introduced to balance "the threats and deceit" of Chiang; abstract "imperialism" has been changed to concrete "imperialists" (persons) to balance "Chiang Kai-shek" (a person).</p>
<p>-The symmetry is emphasized by the "neither... nor" construction, which promises a tight parallelism.</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : "In their effort to strive for"—an empty phrase that means only "in their effort to make efforts"—was replaced with "in their drive for," which was both shorter and stronger. )]</p>
<p>19) A: The Chinese Communist Party <u>put forward a proposal that we should establish</u>
 a new China which would be, in the words of Mao Zedong, "independent, free, democratic, united, prosperous, and powerful."While the Chiang Kai-shek clique <u>stuck to the point that the Chinese society should still be kept</u>
 in a semi-feudal, semi-colonial status, under the rule of the big landlords and the big bourgeoisie <u>with policies against Communists and the people pursued</u>
 . <u>And the Chinese people would have to face poverty and split of the nation</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: The Communist Party <i>was proposing the establishment of a new China</i>
 that would be, in the words of Mao Zedong, "independent, free, democratic, united, prosperous, and powerful."The Chiang Kai-shek clique, on the other hand, <i>was insisting on the perpetuation of the old China</i>
 —semi-feudal, semi-colonial, ruled by the big landlords and the big bourgeoisie, a China in which <i>the people would remain sunk in poverty, Communists would be persecuted, and the nation would be split.</i>
</p>
<p>[-These sentences contrast two different visions of the future of the Chinese people after their victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, one put forward by the Communists, the other by the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Another classic instance where parallel structure is wanted—but in A-version there is none.</p>
<p>-The polisher first tightened the opening clause and corrected the tense, so that the Communist Party "was proposing the establishment of a new China."</p>
<p>-Then, to make the parallel clause match, she changed the wordy "stuck to the point that the Chinese society should still be kept . . ."to the same pattern: "was insisting on the perpetuation of the old China."</p>
<p>-(To emphasize the contrast—and because an independent clause cannot begin with "while"—she substituted "on the other hand" for "While.")</p>
<p>-In the draft version everything after "the big bourgeoisie" is again awkward and disorderly. To introduce some clarifying parallelism into this part of the sentence as well, the polisher rearranged the various elements into three subordinate clauses all following the same pattern ("the people would remain" "the Communists would be" and "the nation would be").]</p>
<p>20) A: It should be recognized that <u>all streams and rivers</u>
 <u>have their source of origin</u>
 , while <u>trees</u>
 <u>depend on their roots for growth</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: We should recognize that <i>every river has its source</i>
 and <i>every tree grows from its roots.</i>
</p>
<p>[-In context, this was a double metaphor indicating that Mao Zedong Thought originated in Marxism-Leninism. In A-version the lack of parallel structure (and the presence of superfluous words) destroys any potential rhythm and undermines the force of the imagery.</p>
<p>-In the revision the polisher did everything possible to reduce each of the two complementary images to its concise essence and to emphasize their similarity of meaning.</p>
<p>-First, the unnecessary words were eliminated: "streams," because it was the redundant twin of "rivers" and to match the single word "trees" ; "of origin," because it was redundant with "source."</p>
<p>-Next, the patterns of the two clauses ("all rivers have their source" /"trees depend on their roots for growth") were brought into closer conformity ("every river has its source" /"every tree grows from its roots").</p>
<p>-Lastly, the subordinate conjunction "while" was changed to the coordinate "and," again to stress the equivalence of the two ideas.</p>
<p>-(The weak and unnecessary passive voice—"It should be recognized"—was changed to active—"We should recognize.")]</p>
