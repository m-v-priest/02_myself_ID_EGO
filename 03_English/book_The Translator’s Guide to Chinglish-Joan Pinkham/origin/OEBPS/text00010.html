<title>VI. Summing it All Up</title>
</head>
<body style="font-family:cnepub,serif;">
<h2>VI. Summing it All Up</h2>
<p>Throughout the preceding chapters, Chinese polishers who are reviewing a draft translation in English, whether it is their own work or that of another translator, have been encouraged to tighten loose sentences. That is, they have been urged to edit out superfluous words that waste the reader's time, obscure the writer's meaning and make any text seem heavy and longwinded.</p>
<p>This advice flows from the widely agreed-upon rule that writers of English should be concise. The rule is summed up in the classic injunction of Professor Strunk quoted on the first page of this book: "A sentence should contain no unnecessary words... for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts."</p>
<p>At the same time, you have been cautioned to exercise care in eliminating a word or phrase that seems unnecessary. Often, you will need to refer back to the original text to check the translation: it may be that in a more accurate version the apparent redundancy will disappear. But even if you confirm your initial judgment that the expression in question serves no purpose, there may be special reasons for retaining it. The degree to which you feel free to depart from a literal version of the Chinese will inevitably depend to some extent on the kind of text you are dealing with and on the kind of readers to whom it is addressed.</p>
<p>The decision to allow an unnecessary word to stand, however, must remain an exception. The "golden rule" for translators writing English is the same as that proposed by the respected authority Ernest Gowers [p. 3] for British civil servants: "to pick those words that convey to the reader the meaning of the writer and to use them and them only."</p>
<p>The professional responsibility of the translator is not to trade English words for Chinese equivalents but to select those English words that "convey to the reader the meaning of the writer."It is to give Chinese authors fair exchange for their characters, not in equal measure but in equal value.</p>
<h3 id="c1">Twenty more examples of revision</h3>
<p>We have now studied the five major categories of unnecessary words in Chinglish: superfluous nouns and verbs, superfluous adjectives and adverbs, redundant twins, repeated ideas and repeated references to the same thing. By way of review, here are twenty final examples representing all five.</p>
<p>Since most of these examples present more than one problem, it should be noted that not all problems need be solved simultaneously. Revision is typically accomplished not all at once but in stages. Polishers may do something to tighten a wordy passage, but if they then, or later, reread the revised version, they will often think of further improvements. (The hope, of course, is to think of all of them before, rather than after, the work appears in print. )</p>
<p>This means that the "A-version, B-version" format used in this book is only a convenience. In practice—especially if more than one person is involved in the revision—there is likely to be not just a B-version but a C and perhaps even a D.</p>
<p>In the following examples the changes that appear in the revisions are explained in the order in which they were made. This will show the successive steps by which the polisher arrived at a final version. As will be seen, redundant twins and superfluous modifiers, being the easiest to recognize and eliminate, were often dealt with first, before the more difficult problems were addressed.</p>
<p>Only the unnecessary or repetitive words are underlined in the A-versions, with revisions italicized in the B-versions. Some A-versions present other faults which have not been discussed but which the polisher has also corrected in B. These are not highlighted in the same way, but most of them are mentioned in parentheses at the end of the explanation of revision.</p>
<p>1) A: We should <u>enthusiastically</u>
 <u>explore</u>
 both the <u>international</u>
 and domestic <u>markets</u>
 , <u>opening up</u>
 new <u>international</u>
 <u>markets</u>
 and further <u>exploring</u>
 the rural market.</p>
<p>B: We should try to <i>open up</i>
 new <i>international</i>
 and domestic <i>markets</i>
 , especially <i>exploring (or, better:</i>
 expanding) the rural market.</p>
<p>[-As soon as the polisher read A-version she deleted "enthusiastically" as an overemphatic and superfluous modifier.</p>
<p>-She then noted the two references to international markets. As there seemed to be no difference between "exploring" markets and "opening up" new ones, she decided to eliminate one mention. Accordingly, she dropped "explore," which was the vaguer of the two and was repeated a few words later.]</p>
<p>2) A: On the whole, however, financial and economic work was still decentralized, because <u>we had not adopted measures to bring financial revenue under unified management</u>
 ; only expenditure was unified, <u>not revenue</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: On the whole, however, financial and economic work was still decentralized, because we had <i>brought expenditure under unified management, but not revenue.</i>
</p>
<p>[-First the polisher eliminated "financial" revenue as redundant. Except when there is some reference to taxes in kind (grain, for example), all revenue is "financial."</p>
<p>-Next she replaced "adopted measures to bring" (an unnec. verb + unnec. noun + third word construction) with the plain verb "brought."</p>
<p>-Then she noticed that the idea that revenue had not been "unified" was expressed in two ways ("we had not brought revenue under unified management" and "not revenue"). She recast the sentence to eliminate one of them.]</p>
<p>3) A: Foreign <u>experience</u>
 has shown that some countries have <u>experienced development periods</u>
 or <u>undergone a number of high-growth stages</u>
 , as demonstrated in Japan, South Korea and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>B: The <i>experience</i>
 of other countries shows that some of them—Japan, South Korea and parts of Southeast Asia, for example—<i>have gone through one or more periods of rapid development.</i>
</p>
<p>[-To avoid an annoying repetition of the same word, the polisher immediately changed "have experienced" to "have gone through."</p>
<p>-Then she considered the "development periods" and "high-growth stages," which looked suspiciously like the same thing. The difference between them was not explained, and she could see none.</p>
<p>-But before deciding that the sentence merely said the same thing twice, she checked the Chinese. The repetition, she discovered, was only in the English version. It had apparently come about because the translator had not clearly understood the original.</p>
<p>-The distinction the speaker was making was not between "development periods" and "high-growth stages" but rather between countries that had experienced one period or stage of rapid development and others that had experienced several.</p>
<p>-That understanding made it possible to eliminate the redundancy and also to combine the two expressions into one: "some of them... have gone through one or more periods of rapid development."]</p>
<p>4) A: The offices of the Military Control Commission were located in an area where board and lodging, and public transport and <u>communication facilities were easily available</u>
 and where <u>telephone contacts could be made with much convenience</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: The offices of the Military Control Commission were located in an area where board and lodging, public transportation, and <i>communication facilities, including telephones, were readily available.</i>
</p>
<p>[-Rereading the end of A-version, the polisher wondered why "telephone contacts" should be mentioned separately, as if they were something apart from "communication facilities."The entire last clause ("where telephone contacts could be made... .") was redundant, she thought, and should be eliminated.</p>
<p>-Checking against the original, however, she decided that telephones were specifically mentioned because they were of special importance.</p>
<p>-Accordingly, she retained the telephones, but only as a component of "communication facilities."]</p>
<p>5) A: Moreover, they are in the habit of <u>taking more than their due</u>
 and do not make compensation for or return the <u>things which they are not entitled to</u>
 but which they <u>have taken into their own possession</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: Moreover, they <i>take things to which they are not entitled</i>
 and never return <i>them</i>
 or make compensation.</p>
<p>[-When she first read A-version the polisher had an impression of constant repetition. She read it again to see why that was so.</p>
<p>-"Things which they are not entitled to" was plainly the same as "more than their due."Of the two, she chose "which they are not entitled to," using the preferred order, "to which they are not entitled."</p>
<p>-This produced: "Moreover, they are in the habit of taking things to which they are not entitled and do not make compensation for or return the things which they have taken into their own possession."</p>
<p>-Now it was clear that the end of the sentence merely repeated the beginning. The things "which they have taken into their own possession" were the same as the things "they are in the habit of taking."She dispensed with the repetition, replacing the second "things" with "them."</p>
<p>-The revision now stood as follows: " Moreover, they are in the habit of taking things to which they are not entitled and do not make compensation for or return them."A more logical order seemed to be, "and do not return them or make compensation," so the polisher made that adjustment.</p>
<p>-Finally, for further tightening, she changed "in the habit of taking" to "take."That version eliminated the noun "habit" and conveyed more concisely the notion of habitual action. To reinforce the idea she changed "not" to "never."]</p>
<p>6) A: Therefore, we should <u>approach, study and solve</u>
 <u>the problem of development</u>
 from the high plane of all mankind. Only in this way can we understand that <u>the problem of development</u>
 is the responsibility of the developing and the developed countries as well.</p>
<p>B: We should therefore <i>consider and solve the problem of development</i>
 from the perspective of a broad concern for all mankind. Only then can we understand that <i>this problem</i>
 is the responsibility of both the developing and the developed countries.</p>
<p>[-The polisher first took a critical look at "approach, study and solve.""Approach," she thought, was so vague that it could not be distinguished from "study."She decided they were redundant twins and replaced both with "consider."</p>
<p>-Seeing that "the problem of development" was repeated, she shortened the second reference by means of a demonstrative adjective: "this problem."</p>
<p>-But now she saw that the "this" she had introduced repeated the one used just before in "Only in this way."To remedy that she changed "only in this way" to "only then."</p>
<p>-(Lastly, she tackled the most difficult problem, rewriting "from the high plane of all mankind" to make a clearer and more idiomatic version. After discussing the meaning of the Chinese with another polisher, she came up with "from the perspective of a broad concern for all mankind.")]</p>
<p>7) A: Of course, we must have <u>a certain number</u>
 of <u>professional revolutionaries</u>
 who may not get involved in the <u>specific production activities</u>
 and <u>a proper number</u>
 of physicians as well as <u>a certain number</u>
 of <u>personnel specializing in literary, artistic and other related activities</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: Of course, we must have <i>a certain number of revolutionary professionals—</i>
 doctors, <i>writers, artists, and other specialists</i>
 —who are not involved in <i>production</i>
 .</p>
<p>[-On first reading, the polisher could make no sense of A-version. She was only aware that it was wordy and repetitive and needed to be edited down.</p>
<p>-As a start, she reduced "specific production activities" to "production."</p>
<p>-Next she saw that "personnel specializing in literary, artistic and other related activities" was only a circumlocution for "writers, artists, and other specialists," which she accordingly substituted.</p>
<p>-Then she added "physicians" to the list of specialists, using the simpler term "doctors."This change eliminated one of the three references to "a certain (or proper) number."</p>
<p>-The revision now stood as follows: "Of course, we must have a certain number of professional revolutionaries who may not get involved in production and a certain number of doctors, writers, artists and other specialists."That version was not so wordy, but the meaning was no clearer than before.</p>
<p>-It was only when the polisher consulted the Chinese that she understood what the difficulty was: the key words had been mistranslated.</p>
<p>-The speaker was not talking about "professional revolutionaries" (i. e., persons whose profession in life was to make revolution) but rather about "revolutionary professionals" (i. e., persons who had a profession—medicine, writing, etc.—and who were revolutionary in their thinking).</p>
<p>-Once the doctors and other specialists had been identified as the revolutionary professionals, the misleading "and a certain number of doctors" and so on could be eliminated: "we must have a certain number of revolutionary professionals who are not involved in production—doctors, writers, artists and other specialists."</p>
<p>-That was both clear and concise. All that remained was to improve the word order: "we must have a certain number of revolutionary professionals—doctors, writers, artists and other specialists—who are not involved in production.”]</p>
<p>8) A: Various departments should quickly <u>establish and strengthen necessary</u>
 research organs to <u>carry out work</u>
 <u>in coordination with</u>
 the Chinese Academy of Sciences <u>in a joint effort</u>
 for expanding the scientific force.</p>
<p>B: Various departments should quickly <i>establish</i>
 research organs to <i>work jointly with</i>
 the Chinese Academy of Sciences to expand the scientific force.</p>
<p>[-A-version, the polisher saw, was clear enough and needed only some tightening that would not be difficult.</p>
<p>-She first spotted the redundant twins "establish and strengthen."Although the words did not mean the same thing, she thought that in this context they were nevertheless redundant because one implied the other. Any institution, once established, should be strengthened, improved, perfected, etc. She deleted "strengthen."</p>
<p>-That the research organs were "necessary" was implicit in the statement that they should be established, so she deleted that word too.</p>
<p>-Next she replaced "carry out work," an unnec. verb + noun construction, with the plain verb "work."</p>
<p>-Finally, since "in coordination with" merely duplicated the sense of "in a joint effort"—a double reference to the same idea—she replaced both with the adverb "jointly."]</p>
<p>9) A: We shall step up medical <u>research</u>
 , <u>focusing on</u>
 the causes for <u>incidence of</u>
 common illnesses and their prevention and treatment, and <u>concentrating on tackling</u>
 the key <u>research</u>
 projects.</p>
<p>B: We shall step up medical <i>research, concentrating on</i>
 key projects <i>for the study of</i>
 the cause, prevention, and treatment of common illnesses.</p>
<p>[-The cause of the incidence of a disease = the cause of the disease, so the polisher deleted "incidence."</p>
<p>-Concentrating on tackling projects = concentrating on the projects, so she deleted "tackling" as well.</p>
<p>-"Focusing on" = "concentrating on," so she changed the structure of the sentence to condense them into one.</p>
<p>-At the same time, she eliminated the repetition of "research" by changing "research projects" to "projects for the study of."That was plainly the intended meaning, and it tied the two parts of the sentence together.]</p>
<p>10) A: In this decision [of the Central Committee] the <u>necessity and urgency</u>
 of <u>rectification</u>
 was <u>explicitly</u>
 expounded and the basic tasks for the <u>rectification</u>
 were <u>clearly</u>
 defined as follows: to unify thinking, <u>rectify</u>
 the style of work, tighten discipline and purify the organizations.</p>
<p>B: In this decision the Central Committee explained the <i>urgency</i>
 of <i>rectification</i>
 and defined <i>its</i>
 basic tasks as follows: to unify the members' thinking, <i>improve</i>
 their style of work, tighten discipline and weed out those who were unqualified.</p>
<p>[-The polisher paused as soon as she came to the twins "necessity and urgency."If a task was "urgent," it was not only "necessary" but pressing; in short, the second idea included the first. (She noted in passing that the translator also evidently thought of the two words as one, since he or she had used the singular verb "was" instead of the correct plural "were.")</p>
<p>-Of the two words, she retained the one that was more inclusive, "urgency."</p>
<p>-Reading on, she quickly deleted the two adverbs "explicitly" and "clearly."Explanations and definitions are assumed to be explicit and clear unless there is some indication to the contrary.</p>
<p>-Then she considered how to eliminate the repetition "rectification" /"rectification" /"rectify."She replaced the second "rectification" with the possessive pronoun "its" and changed "rectify" to "improve."</p>
<p>-(To make the sentence more vigorous and direct, she put it in active voice by introducing "The Central Committee" as the subject. Then, to give a concrete anchor to the unattached "thinking" and "style of work," she brought in "the members.")</p>
<p>-(She had left until last the more difficult question of "purify the organizations."This was a political metaphor that might not be readily understood by foreign readers. After reflecting on the meaning of the phrase, she substituted a different expression that was more familiar in English: "weed out those who were unqualified.")]</p>
<p>11) A: With regard to the <u>existing practices</u>
 of <u>vying for gaining</u>
 investments <u>and for undertaking</u>
 construction projects <u>in an unchecked way</u>
 , we must stop <u>them</u>
 by strictly implementing the state's industrial policies, improving the scientific feasibility appraisal and management of projects and tightening control over <u>the amount of</u>
 bank credit.</p>
<p>B: <i>We must put a stop to the blind competition for investments and construction projects</i>
 by strictly implementing the state's industrial policies, improving the (scientific) feasibility studies and the management of projects, and tightening control over bank credit.</p>
<p>[-On reading A-version the polisher realized it would need considerable revision, so she looked first for easy changes with which she could make a start.</p>
<p>-"The amount of" added nothing to the sense of "bank credit."She deleted the phrase.</p>
<p>-Since only "existing" practices need to be stopped, "existing" could be taken for granted. She eliminated that word also.</p>
<p>-And now that she thought about it, "practices" itself was only a superfluous category noun, so it too could come out. But that left "With regard to vying for..., we must stop them."Since the pronoun "them" no longer had an antecedent, it had to be replaced by the noun it stood for: "we must stop these practices."</p>
<p>-At this point, the polisher backed up. The source of these complications, she now realized, was the opening phrase "With regard to."Why not abandon that construction and just say, "We must put a stop to vying etc."? That took care of "practices" /"them" and was in any event simpler and more direct. Done.</p>
<p>-So far, the revision of the first part of the sentence read as follows: "We must put a stop to vying for gaining investments and for undertaking construction projects in an unchecked way by strictly implementing etc."</p>
<p>-On rereading, the polisher saw that the two gerunds, "gaining" and "undertaking," were superfluous. The idea could be expressed perfectly well without them: "We must put a stop to vying for investments and construction projects."</p>
<p>-Next she addressed the awkward expression "vying for... in an unchecked way."The whole thing, she thought, could be neatly replaced by "blind competition for."</p>
<p>-These changes produced: "We must put a stop to the blind competition for investments and construction projects by strictly implementing... ."</p>
<p>-(Turning to the end of the sentence, the polisher paused over "feasibility appraisal."There was nothing wrong with that term, but she substituted the more usual one, "feasibility studies.")</p>
<p>-As for "scientific," she was tempted to eliminate the adjective on the grounds that it was merely decorative (such studies are always supposed to be "scientific"). Still, since it was there in the Chinese...]</p>
<p>12) A: In combating international <u>terrorism</u>
 , we emphasize the prevention of <u>terrorists</u>
 from inciting <u>terrorist</u>
 incidents in China or taking China as a base for <u>terrorist</u>
 activities.</p>
<p>B: In combating international <i>terrorism,</i>
 our chief concern is to prevent <i>terrorists</i>
 from inciting incidents in China or using China as a base for <i>their</i>
 activities.</p>
<p>[-The polisher thought that in one sentence four references to the same idea in virtually the same terms were both intolerable and unnecessary.</p>
<p>-She judged the first two references ("terrorism," "terrorists") to be unavoidable. The third, however ("terrorist" incidents) was self-evident in context: the reader assumes that incidents incited by terrorists are "terrorist" incidents. Accordingly, she deleted it.</p>
<p>-The fourth use of the term was equally superfluous: the activities of terrorists are, by definition, "terrorist" activities. She therefore replaced the adjective with a possessive pronoun, "their."]</p>
<p>13) A: The <u>orientation and aim</u>
 of political reform are... to improve the socialist legal system and to <u>effectively</u>
 guarantee the rights of the <u>masses of</u>
 people as masters of the country.</p>
<p>B: The <i>aim (or:</i>
 goal) of political reform is... to improve the socialist legal system and guarantee the rights of the people as masters of the country.</p>
<p>[-The polisher first eliminated the redundant intensifier "effectively" : a "guarantee" is "effective" by definition (otherwise, it does not guarantee anything).</p>
<p>-Next she deleted "masses of," since "the masses" = "the people."</p>
<p>-Then she considered "orientation and aim."What, she wondered, was the "orientation" of a program of reform? The word seemed to have no meaning here, or so vague and abstract a meaning that it added nothing to the plain sense of "aim."She edited "orientation" out too.]</p>
<p>14) A: During the three-year period of <u>improvement of the economic environment and rectification of the economic order</u>
 , the State Council, the various ministries and commissions and local governments at different levels issued a series of documents. Generally speaking, these documents have <u>played a positive role in promoting</u>
 the program of <u>economic improvement and rectification</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: During the three-year period of <i>improvement of the economic environment and rectification of the economic order,</i>
 the State Council, the various ministries and commissions and local governments at different levels issued a series of documents. Generally speaking, these documents <i>helped achieve the objectives of that period</i>
 .</p>
<p>[-First, to avoid repeating a long phrase heavy with nouns, the polisher replaced the second reference to "economic improvement and rectification" with a summary expression: "the objectives of that period."This made it possible to eliminate "the program of" as well.</p>
<p>-Next, seeing that "played a positive role in promoting" was only an elaborate way of saying "helped promote," she substituted the simpler version. On reflection, she then changed "helped promote" to the stronger "helped achieve."]</p>
<p>15) <i>The next sentence after the preceding example:</i>
</p>
<p>A: Now that <u>this program</u>
 has ended, <u>the State Council, various ministries and commissions and all local governments</u>
 should <u>earnestly</u>
 check up these documents, continuing to implement those that still <u>play a positive role at present</u>
 and revising or abolishing <u>by formal decree</u>
 those that do not suit the current <u>real</u>
 conditions and the needs of economic development.</p>
<p>B: Now that <i>it</i>
 has ended, however, <i>the State Council and the other issuing authorities</i>
 should review these documents, continuing to implement those that <i>are still useful</i>
 and revising or <i>formally</i>
 withdrawing those that are no longer appropriate to current conditions or the needs of economic development.</p>
<p>[-On first reading A-version, the polisher had the impression that it needed a good deal of cutting but that none of the necessary changes would require much thought. She therefore went back to the beginning and dealt with the superfluous words in the order in which they appeared.</p>
<p>-Since the "program" had been edited out of the preceding sentence, she substituted "it," referring to the three-year "period" just mentioned.</p>
<p>-"The State Council, various ministries and commissions and all local governments" had just been spelled out above (see example 14). To avoid repeating so much material, she used a summary expression, "the State Council and the other issuing authorities."</p>
<p>-She unhesitatingly cut "earnestly" on the grounds that it was merely a cliché modifier (everything should always be done earnestly, carefully, conscientiously, etc. ).</p>
<p>-Next she replaced the wordy and abstract "play a positive role at present" with the short, concrete "are still useful."</p>
<p>-She reduced "by formal decree" to "formally."(At the same time, she changed "abolish" to "withdraw," because one cannot "abolish" a document. )</p>
<p>-Since "current conditions" are "real" by definition, "real" was then eliminated as an unnec. intensifier.</p>
<p>-(Finally, having gotten rid of the unnecessary words, she added a necessary one. She introduced a "however" near the beginning of the sentence to express the logical progress of the argument that was implied in Chinese but needed to be stated outright in English: the documents were useful then; however, they may no longer be useful now. )]</p>
<p>16) A: <u>In the rural areas</u>
 we should <u>pay attention to</u>
 economical use of land and <u>try our utmost</u>
 to use less or no arable land in <u>rural</u>
 housing construction.</p>
<p>B: As for housing construction <i>in rural areas,</i>
 we should <i>try</i>
 to be economical in our use of land and <i>especially</i>
 to use little or no arable land.</p>
<p>[-The polisher saw at once that there was no need for both "In the rural areas" and "in rural housing construction."She combined them into a single opening phrase, "As for housing construction in rural areas."</p>
<p>-Next she condensed the two verb phrases—the meaningless "pay attention to" and the overworked "try our utmost"—into a single plain verb, "try."</p>
<p>-Then, to replace the emphasis that had been lost when she eliminated "utmost," she added "especially."]</p>
<p>17) A: Waste does not simply mean <u>extravagance and squandering</u>
 but <u>handling affairs or spending money</u>
 without considering <u>importance and urgency</u>
 and the need to subordinate the part to the whole. That is to say, <u>revenue is not appropriately used on the most important undertakings</u>
 , but <u>rather unwisely on the unimportant ones</u>
 .</p>
<p>B: Waste does not simply mean <i>squandering</i>
 money. Also and particularly it means <i>spending money</i>
 without considering <i>priorities</i>
 and the need to subordinate the part to the whole—that is, <i>spending it unwisely on unimportant projects.</i>
</p>
<p>[-The dictionary definition of "squandering" money is spending it "extravagantly or wastefully.""Extravagance" and"squandering" were therefore redundant twins, and the polisher began by eliminating one.</p>
<p>-She chose to retain "squandering," partly because it was the more unusual word and partly because with the obligatory direct object "money" it made a clearer statement than "extravagance" alone would have done.</p>
<p>-Next she paused over "without considering importance and urgency" : importance and urgency of what? Various projects, presumably, but that was not stated. She substituted "priorities," which was neater and did not raise the same question.</p>
<p>-The first sentence now read: "Waste does not simply mean squandering money, but handling affairs or spending money without considering priorities and the need to subordinate the part to the whole."</p>
<p>-That was better, but "handling affairs" was exceedingly vague. Since the topic was wasting money, the "affairs" in question could only be affairs involving decisions about expenditure. And if that was so, the phrase was redundant with "spending money" and could therefore be omitted.</p>
<p>-Proceeding to the next sentence, the polisher recognized it as a mirror-image construction in which the same idea was expressed twice. Once it was stated that revenue was not used on important undertakings, there was no need to say it was used on unimportant ones. Or vice versa—either the first statement of the idea or the second could be dispensed with.</p>
<p>-Considering which to eliminate, the polisher saw that if she retained the second statement (that revenue was used unwisely on unimportant projects), she could attach it neatly to the preceding sentence: “... spending money without considering priorities and the need to subordinate the part to the whole—that is, spending it unwisely on unimportant projects."</p>
<p>-(But now the sentence was too long. She decided to break it after the first clause: "Waste does not simply mean squandering money. It also means spending money without considering priorities etc.")</p>
<p>-(The first polisher, a foreigner who did not read Chinese, left the passage in that form. It was a second polisher who, reviewing the work of the first and comparing it with the Chinese, found that the original translator had omitted an element of meaning. To correct this, she changed "It also means" to "Also and particularly it means.")]</p>
<p>18) A: <u>Great efforts are required</u>
 to <u>achieve the goal</u>
 that by the year 1990 the <u>freight</u>
 volume of <u>various kinds of cargo</u>
 will <u>register an increase</u>
 of <u>about</u>
 30 per cent over 1985.</p>
<p>B: <i>We must try to increase</i>
 the volume of <i>freight</i>
 handled annually, so that by 1990 it is 30 per cent greater than in 1985.</p>
<p>[-Judging that in this case "Great efforts are required" was only a variation on the empty introductory phrase "make great efforts," the polisher changed it to "We must try."That revision had the further advantage of putting the statement in active voice.</p>
<p>-Analyzing the remainder of the sentence, she saw that what "we must try to do" was in skeleton form "achieve the goal that x will register an increase." Most of that, she decided, was "empty words."</p>
<p>-"Achieve the goal that" was merely a superfluous preliminary. "Register an increase" was just the familiar combination of unnec. verb + noun. The only real action was expressed in the noun "increase."</p>
<p>-Since the essential "verb work" was being performed by "increase," she promoted that word to the status of verb, made "we" the subject and dispensed with all the rest: "We must try to increase x... ."</p>
<p>-"Various kinds of," she thought, could be taken for granted. For the matter of that, "cargo" was only an unnecessary repetition of "freight."After a moment's reflection, she deleted the entire phrase.</p>
<p>-The “30%” was clearly only an approximate target figure, so "about" could come out too.</p>
<p>-(After cutting all these words, the polisher inserted two that she thought were needed for clarity: "handled annually.")]</p>
<p>19) A: <u>Earnest efforts will also be made</u>
 in the <u>exploitation and utilization</u>
 of solar, wind and geothermal energy.</p>
<p>B: Solar, wind and geothermal energy <i>will also be exploited.</i>
</p>
<p>[-The polisher first deleted one of the redundant twins "exploitation and utilization."</p>
<p>-She recognized "Earnest efforts will be made in the exploitation" as a passive-voice version of "we shall make earnest efforts to exploit"—that is, another variation on "make great efforts."</p>
<p>-She was about to remove the expression, but this sentence appeared in an important document (the Seventh Five-Year Plan), and the team of translators were being particularly careful with it. She therefore consulted the senior reviser first.</p>
<p>-Talking it over, the two polishers decided that the government expected to make "earnest efforts" to fulfill all of the many tasks set forth in the Plan, and that there was no particular reason for underlining its determination to accomplish this one.</p>
<p>-They thought, in short, that in this case the emphasis in the Chinese was merely habitual and did not have to be carried over into English—better to save it for a passage where it was needed. Accordingly, they used a simple statement of intent: "... will also be exploited."]</p>
<p>20) A: To enrich the people's lives, <u>conscientious efforts should be made</u>
 to <u>bring about a thriving situation</u>
 in <u>literary and artistic spheres</u>
 such as <u>literary creations</u>
 , drama, operas, music, dance....</p>
<p>B: To enrich people's lives, <i>we must ensure that literature and art flourish</i>
 . This includes <i>novels</i>
 , <i>poems</i>
 , plays, operas, music, dance....</p>
<p>[-This sentence also appeared in the Seventh Five-Year Plan.</p>
<p>-As soon as the polisher finished reading A-version, she reduced "literary and artistic spheres" to "literature and art" and changed "such as" to "including."</p>
<p>-Returning then to the beginning of the sentence, she edited out "conscientious efforts should be made," for the same reason that "earnest efforts will be made" had been eliminated in the preceding example. At the same time, she changed the verb to active voice.</p>
<p>-These revisions produced: "To enrich people's lives, we should bring about a thriving situation in literature and art, including etc."</p>
<p>-But that was not quite right: what had to be "thriving" was not the situation but the arts. Indeed, the polisher now saw that, as usual, "situation" added nothing but a needless complication. She revised it out: "we must ensure that literature and art thrive."Then, because she felt a longer word was wanted for better rhythm, she substituted "flourish."</p>
<p>-To avoid the repetition "literature" /"literary creations" (and also because this latter expression would include "drama"), she substituted for "literary creations" "novels and poems," which she understood to be the intended meaning.</p>
<p>-(Finally, because the sentence was very long, she dropped "including" and started fresh with "This includes.")]</p>
