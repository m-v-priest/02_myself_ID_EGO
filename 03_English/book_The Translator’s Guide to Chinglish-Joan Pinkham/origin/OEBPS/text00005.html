<h2>I. Unnecessary Nouns and Verbs</h2>
<h3 id="c1">Nouns</h3>
<p>Most unnecessary nouns in Chinglish appear not alone but in short phrases, combined with articles and prepositions. When you eliminate the nouns, you eliminate the articles and prepositions as well.</p>
<p>Many of these nouns are easy to recognize. They are plainly redundant because their sense is already included or implied in some other element of the sentence. Here are a few examples ("A") with suggested revisions ("B") and comments in brackets.</p>
<p>A: to accelerate <u>the pace of</u>
 economic reform</p>
<p>B: to accelerate economic reform</p>
<p>["To accelerate" = "to increase the pace of."]</p>
<p>A: there have been good harvests <u>in agriculture</u>
</p>
<p>B: there have been good harvests</p>
<p>["Harvests" implies agriculture: there are no harvests in industry.]</p>
<p>A: living standards <u>for the people</u>
 in both urban and rural areas continued to rise</p>
<p>B: living standards in both urban and rural areas continued to rise</p>
<p>[The notion of living standards applies only to people.]</p>
<p>A: these hardships are temporary <u>in nature</u>
</p>
<p>B: these hardships are temporary</p>
<p>[Any adjective describes the "nature" or "character" of the noun it modifies. To say that hardships are "temporary in nature" is like saying that the Chinese flag is "red in color" or that pandas are "few in number."]</p>
<p>A: the development of our economy <u>in the future</u>
 will, to a large extent, depend on...</p>
<p>B: the development of our economy will depend to a large extent on...</p>
<p>[The future tense of the verb ("will depend") is sufficient to express futurity.]</p>
<p>A: we should adopt <u>a series of</u>
 measures to ensure that...</p>
<p>B: we should adopt measures to ensure that...</p>
<p>[Here the plural form of "measures" covers the sense of a "series."]</p>
<p>Other unnecessary nouns (or gerunds) may be less easy to identify. Nevertheless, a little thought will reveal that they add nothing to the meaning of the sentence. When they are deleted the sense is not diminished, only clarified. Some examples:</p>
<p>A: following the <u>realization of</u>
 mechanization and electrification of agriculture</p>
<p>B: following the mechanization and electrification of agriculture</p>
<p>A: it is essential to strengthen <u>the building of</u>
 national defense</p>
<p>B: it is essential to strengthen national defense</p>
<p>A: these constitute important conditions <u>in striving</u>
 for the fulfillment of the general task in the transitional period</p>
<p>B: these are important conditions for fulfilling the general task in the transition period</p>
<p>A: at that time <u>the situation</u>
 in northeast China was still one where the enemy was stronger than the people's forces</p>
<p>B: at that time the enemy was still stronger than the people's forces in northeast China</p>
<p>["Situation" is a particularly dangerous noun. Not only is it generally unnecessary, but it drags other unnecessary elements after it (in this instance, "one where").]</p>
<p>A: <u>the key to</u>
 the solution lies in the curtailment of expenditure</p>
<p>B: the solution is to curtail (<i>or:</i>
 cut back on) expenditure</p>
<p>["Key" is sometimes useful, but usually it too can be dispensed with. And like "situation," it often leads to further unnecessary complications (here, "lies in").]</p>
<p>A: inner-Party democracy <u>is a subject that</u>
 has been discussed in detail</p>
<p>B: inner-Party democracy has been discussed in detail</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Category nouns</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>There is one type of noun that deserves special mention, because it is the commonest unnecessary word in Chinglish. This is the general noun that serves only to introduce a specific noun (or gerund) to follow: "a serious mistake in <u>the work of</u>
 planning."</p>
<p>In such constructions, the first noun announces the category of the second; in this case, it tells readers that "planning" falls into the category of "work."That is something they already know. Accordingly, the first noun should be deleted: "a serious mistake in planning."</p>
<p>Other examples:</p>
<p>A: promoting <u>the cause of</u>
 peaceful reunification</p>
<p>B: promoting peaceful reunification</p>
<p>A: reforms in <u>the sphere of</u>
 the economy</p>
<p>B: reforms in the economy (<i>or</i>
 : economic reforms)</p>
<p>A: to ensure <u>a relationship of</u>
 close cooperation between...</p>
<p>B: to ensure close cooperation between...</p>
<p>A: we must oppose <u>the practice of</u>
 extravagance</p>
<p>B: we must oppose extravagance</p>
<p>A: these principles apply to all <u>cases of</u>
 relations between China and other countries</p>
<p>B: these principles apply to relations between China and all other countries</p>
<p>A: this, coupled with <u>the factor of</u>
 price instability, caused...</p>
<p>B: this, coupled with price instability, caused...</p>
<p>Whatever function the category noun serves in Chinese, in English it is generally useless. All it adds to the sentence is weight without substance.</p>
<h3 id="c2">Verbs</h3>
<p>Like unnecessary nouns, most unnecessary verbs in Chinglish occur in phrases. Usually, they are combined with nouns (plus the inevitable articles and prepositions that nouns bring with them). These phrases are of two principal types:</p>
<p>1. unnecessary verb plus noun</p>
<p>2. unnecessary verb plus unnecessary noun plus third word</p>
<p>We shall look at first one and then the other.</p>
<p>1. <i>
<u>Unnec. verb + noun</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>The commonest type is a phrase like "we must <u>make an improvement</u>
 in our work."Here the verb ("make") is a weak, colorless, all-purpose word having no very specific meaning of its own, while the real action is expressed in the noun ("improvement"). Since the verb is not contributing anything to the sense, it can be edited out: "we must <i>improve</i>
 our work."</p>
<p>The basic pattern is <u>unnec. verb + noun</u>
 . Both translators and polishers tend to overlook constructions of this sort, because they are grammatically correct and because—precisely—everyone is so accustomed to them. Once you become alert to the pattern, however, it is easy enough to eliminate the unnecessary words by substituting plain verbs:</p>
<p>A: it is impossible for us to <u>accomplish the transformation</u>
 of the whole society overnight</p>
<p>B: it is impossible for us to <i>transform</i>
 the whole society overnight</p>
<p>A: they should <u>conduct a</u>
 careful <u>examination</u>
 of...</p>
<p>B: they should carefully <i>examine</i>
 ...</p>
<p>A: trying to entice the Korean army to <u>launch an attack</u>
 against them</p>
<p>B: trying to entice the Korean army to <i>attack</i>
 them</p>
<p>A: to <u>bring about a change</u>
 in this state of affairs</p>
<p>B: to <i>change</i>
 this state of affairs</p>
<p>A: they must make up their minds to <u>implement the reform</u>
 of the current system</p>
<p>B: they must make up their minds to <i>reform</i>
 the current system</p>
<p>A: until China <u>realizes</u>
 industrial <u>modernization</u>
</p>
<p>B: until China <i>modernizes</i>
 its industry</p>
<p>The construction may also appear in passive voice. That is, instead of "we must <u>make an improvement</u>
 in our work," we find "<u>an improvement must be made</u>
 in our work."But this is only a variation of the same pattern, and the solution is the same too: substitute a plain verb. The result is "our work <i>must be improved</i>
 " (because "to make an improvement in" = "to improve").</p>
<p>More examples in passive voice:</p>
<p>A: <u>approval should be given</u>
 to all these projects</p>
<p>B: all these projects <i>should be approved</i>
</p>
<p>[Because "to give approval to" ="to approve."]</p>
<p>A: <u>solutions</u>
 to these problems <u>can be found</u>
 only through...</p>
<p>B: these problems <i>can be solved</i>
 only through...</p>
<p>[Because "to find solutions to" ="to solve."]</p>
<p>A: grain <u>rationing was implemented</u>
</p>
<p>B: grain <i>was rationed</i>
</p>
<p>[Because "to implement rationing" ="to ration."]</p>
<p>The verb most frequently found in these combinations with nouns is <u>to make</u>
 :</p>
<p>to make an investigation of=to investigate</p>
<p>to make a careful study of=to study carefully</p>
<p>to make a decision to=to decide to</p>
<p>to make a proposal that=to propose that</p>
<p>to make efforts to=to try (<i>or:</i>
 attempt) to</p>
<p>to make an analysis of=to analyze</p>
<p>The runner-up is doubtless <u>to have</u>
 :</p>
<p>to have a dislike for=to dislike</p>
<p>to have trust in=to trust</p>
<p>to have an influence on=to influence</p>
<p>to have adequate knowledge of=to know enough about</p>
<p>to have the need for=to need</p>
<p>to have respect for=to respect</p>
<p>But many others can be seen on every page as well:</p>
<p>to <u>give</u>
 guidance to=to guide</p>
<p>to <u>provide</u>
 assistance to=to assist</p>
<p>to <u>carry out</u>
 the struggle against=to struggle against</p>
<p>to <u>conduct</u>
 reform of=to reform</p>
<p>to <u>engage in</u>
 free discussion of=to discuss (it) freely</p>
<p>to <u>achieve</u>
 success in=to succeed in</p>
<p>to <u>accomplish</u>
 the modernization of=to modernize</p>
<p>to <u>realize</u>
 the transformation of=to transform</p>
<p>to <u>bring about</u>
 an improvement in=to improve</p>
<p>to <u>place</u>
 stress on=to stress</p>
<p>to <u>exercise</u>
 control over=to control</p>
<p>to <u>register</u>
 an increase=to increase</p>
<p>You should be on the watch for all of them.</p>
<p>2. <i>
<u>Unnec. verb+unnec. noun+third word</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>As we have seen, in the first type of phrase a vague and general verb, incapable of expressing specific action, shifts the responsibility for that task onto a noun. In the second type, however, the noun cannot perform the task either.</p>
<p>Consider "our efforts to <u>reach the goal</u>
 of modernization."Here the noun ("goal") is no more precise than the verb ("reach"). (Indeed, "the goal of" is only another example of the superfluous category noun. ) This means that the work of the verb has to be done by still another word, a second noun ("modernization"). Since now the first noun is not doing anything useful in the sentence, it too can be eliminated, along with the all-purpose verb. The result is, "our efforts to <i>modernize</i>
 ."</p>
<p>In phrases of this type, the basic pattern <u>unnec. verb+noun</u>
 has been expanded to <u>unnec. verb+unnec. noun+third word</u>
 . As in the example above, the third word is usually another <u>noun</u>
 (or gerund). Since this new noun is performing the function of a verb, it should be given the form of a verb.</p>
<p>A: our troops <u>used the method</u>
 of slow advance</p>
<p>B: our troops <i>advanced</i>
 slowly</p>
<p>A: three garrison divisions were necessary to <u>perform the task</u>
 of guarding warehouses</p>
<p>B: three garrison divisions were necessary to <i>guard</i>
 warehouses</p>
<p>A: we <u>adopted the policy</u>
 of withdrawal</p>
<p>B: we <i>withdrew (or:</i>
 decided to withdraw)</p>
<p>[This was a particular tactical retreat, not a general military policy.]</p>
<p>A: in all matters we must <u>assume the attitude</u>
 of admitting what we do and do not know</p>
<p>B: we should always (be ready to) <i>admit</i>
 what we do and do not know</p>
<p>A: we should <u>adopt the principle</u>
 of combining solutions to people's immediate difficulties with long-term development</p>
<p>B: we should <i>combine</i>
 solving people's immediate problems with promoting long-term development</p>
<p>[A further simplification would be: we should try to solve people's immediate problems and at the same time to promote long-term development.]</p>
<p>A: we need to <u>achieve the objective</u>
 of clarity in ideology</p>
<p>B: we need to <i>be clear</i>
 in our ideology</p>
<p>But sometimes the third word called upon to do the verb-work is an <u>adjective</u>
 . Then it is the adjective that should be promoted to the rank of verb, while the idle words are dismissed from service:</p>
<p>A: this measure will <u>have a</u>
 restrictive <u>effect</u>
 on the activities of speculators</p>
<p>B: this measure will <i>restrict</i>
 the activities of speculators</p>
<p>And sometimes the third word is another <u>verb</u>
 . Again, only the functioning word need be retained:</p>
<p>A: we failed to <u>take care to</u>
 ensure that there must be an all-round balance between the various planned targets</p>
<p>B: we failed to <i>ensure</i>
 an all-round balance between the planned targets</p>
<p>["There must be" merely duplicates the sense of "ensure.""Various" adds nothing to the plural "targets."]</p>
<p>Like the category-noun phrases on which they are often based (“to reach <u>the goal of</u>
 modernization”), these unnec. verb+unnec. noun combinations are only empty preliminaries to other words that carry real content. They add no more to the meaning of the sentence than a cough. The writer is merely clearing his throat before he comes to the point.</p>
<p>
<i>Overworked introductory verb phrases</i>
</p>
<p>Chinglish texts typically contain many of these throat-clearing verb phrases, but there is one group of them which recurs so constantly, especially in official statements, that it merits special attention. As noted below, these particular verb+noun combinations have a few plain-verb equivalents that are sometimes found as well. However, no matter whether the verbs appear combined with nouns or standing independently, they do nothing but delay the advent of the main action:</p>
<p>A: it is especially necessary to <u>make great efforts to</u>
 assimilate the achievements of other cultures</p>
<p>B: it is especially necessary to <i>assimilate</i>
 the achievements of other cultures</p>
<p>[What is especially necessary is to assimilate. It is obvious that this process is going to take effort, so we don't have to say so.]</p>
<p>Variants: <u>make every effort to</u>
 , <u>try our best to</u>
 , <u>do our utmost to</u>
 , <u>do everything possible to</u>
 (also, plain verbs: <u>strive to</u>
 , <u>endeavor to</u>
 , <u>work hard to</u>
 ), etc.</p>
<p>A: all enterprises must <u>pay attention to</u>
 promoting excellent workers</p>
<p>B: all enterprises must <i>see to it that</i>
 excellent workers <i>are promoted</i>
</p>
<p>[The point is not that the enterprises must "pay attention" to doing something but that they must <u>do</u>
 it. If they promote workers, they are clearly paying attention to promoting them.]</p>
<p>Variants: <u>pay heed to</u>
 , <u>lay stress on</u>
 , <u>attach importance to</u>
 (also, plain verbs: <u>stress</u>
 , <u>emphasize</u>
 ), etc.</p>
<p>A: the principal task at present is to <u>do a good job in</u>
 disseminating and applying the results of scientific and technological research</p>
<p>B: the principal task at present is to <i>disseminate and</i>
 apply the results of scientific and technological research</p>
<p>[Logically, the task is not to do a good job but to disseminate and apply. It can be taken for granted that people should try to do it well.]</p>
<p>Variants: <u>make a success of</u>
 , <u>achieve success in</u>
 , <u>do successful work in</u>
 (also, verb+adjective: <u>be good at</u>
 ), etc.</p>
<p>In these examples the phrases "make great efforts to", "pay attention to", "do a good job in" are used indiscriminately, without logical necessity. And because they are not needed, they only clutter up the sentence and obscure its point. For that reason alone they should be eliminated.</p>
<p>But there is another reason as well. The expressions in this group have been so weakened by constant repetition that they have lost their power of exhortation. Thus when they <u>are</u>
 needed—that is, when their sense is really intended—they carry no force. They have degenerated into tedious formulas to which the reader no longer pays any attention.</p>
<p>While overworked introductory verb phrases are characteristic of Chinglish, they can also appear in the speech or writing of any native speaker of English who is not careful about language. For example, my American grandfather-in-law, a carpenter from rural New England, used to say, "I'm going to <u>go to work and</u>
 build a set of steps" or "I'm going to <u>go to work and</u>
 shell those peas."</p>
<p>At first I took the phrase to be an expression of the old man's admirable energy and determination. He used it so often, however, that it gradually ceased to impress me in that way. Then one afternoon when he was preparing to lie down to rest, he declared, "I'm going to <u>go to work and</u>
 take a nap."With the exception of myself, a newcomer to the family, none of his listeners noticed anything contradictory in the remark. It was clear that for them, as for Grandpa himself, the oft-repeated phrase had long since lost any literal meaning: it was only his habitual way of announcing an intended action.</p>
<h3 id="c3">A warning about revision</h3>
<p>It is natural enough for unnecessary nouns and verbs to slip into a draft translation. Most often they have been dutifully carried over from the Chinese original, where they are apparently useful or, at least, tolerable. But in accordance with Professor Strunk's principle, in English they are unacceptable: "A sentence should contain no unnecessary words... ."When you reread your work with a critical eye, you should confidently edit them out.</p>
<p>A word of warning, however. First, you have to make sure that the words are indeed "unnec."With a few exceptions, all of the phrases discussed so far sometimes have real content. While three times out of four they are mere cotton padding, the fourth time they may convey an element of meaning that would otherwise be lacking. In that case, of course, they should be allowed to stand.</p>
<p>For example, the noun phrase expressing time is not always redundant with the verb tense: "<u>at present</u>
 it is necessary to. . ."may mean that the necessity is only temporary. The usually worthless category noun can occasionally perform a valid function: "in accordance with <u>the principle of</u>
 self-reliance, all army units should... ."</p>
<p>Phrases such as "make great efforts to," "pay attention to," and "do a good job in" are sometimes perfectly legitimate: "we must <u>make great efforts</u>
 in education" conveys meaning. And even when such a phrase serves to introduce another verb, it is not necessarily superfluous: "we must <u>make great efforts</u>
 to overcome this difficulty" may indicate that the task will be particularly arduous.</p>
<p>This means that whenever you come across one of these suspect phrases in a draft translation, you are called upon to make a judgment. In context, is it justified? Is it necessary for the sense of the passage? Or has it been put into the English version simply because it was present in the Chinese?</p>
<p>Consider "the bourgeoisie <u>followed a policy of</u>
 vacillating."The statement is absurd in English, because to vacillate—that is, to be undecided, to alternate between different positions, to lean now this way and now that—is, precisely, to have no policy. Not only do the words add nothing to the meaning but, as in Grandpa's "I'm going to go to work and take a nap," they actually contradict it. Plainly, they should be deleted ("the bourgeoisie vacillated"). But how about "China has always <u>followed a policy of</u>
 peaceful coexistence" ? That statement makes sense, and here the words are essential to express the meaning. Plainly, they should be retained.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, the choice is not so clear. What should be done, for example, with "we must <u>follow the policy of</u>
 putting quality first" ? Was the phrase used in Chinese only from force of habit? Is this just Chinglish for "we must always put quality first" ? Or did the writer really mean to stress the notion of a policy? Perhaps we should keep the "policy" and even recast the sentence to emphasize it: "we must make it our policy to put quality first."The translator must decide.</p>
<p>Machines have been devised to perform certain types of translation, but they cannot distinguish between meaningful and meaningless uses of the same phrase. That is the difference between you and a machine.</p>
<h3 id="c4">Twenty more examples of revision</h3>
<p>Here are twenty more examples of superfluous nouns and verbs, together with suggested revisions.</p>
<p>In the A-versions the unnecessary nouns and verbs are underlined. In the revisions some of them were simply deleted; others were replaced by different words, and the new versions are italicized. The comments in brackets at the end of each example explain the reasons the changes were made. (The explanations in parentheses refer to other faults that were corrected in addition to those discussed in this chapter. )</p>
<p>Note that in every case the edited version is not only shorter but also simpler and easier to understand.</p>
<p>1) A: when making revolution in Guangzhou <u>in the past</u>
 , we were young and arrogant</p>
<p>B: when we were making revolution in Guangzhou, we were young and arrogant</p>
<p>[The past tenses of the verbs ("were making" and "were") suffice to place the action "in the past."]</p>
<p>2) A: this accounts for the inadequate efficiency <u>in the performance</u>
 <u>of their duties</u>
</p>
<p>B: this accounts for their inefficiency</p>
<p>[People's "efficiency" normally refers to the way they do their work (perform their duties), so there is no need to spell it out.]</p>
<p>3) A: these nine years <u>constitute a period in which</u>
 the national economic strength has increased</p>
<p>B: in these nine years the economy has grown stronger</p>
<p>[-"Constitute a period in which" is mere filler, adding nothing to the sense of "nine years."</p>
<p>-("National" was omitted in the revised version because it is assumed that "the economy" means the national economy. )]</p>
<p>4) A: it is also necessary to <u>put an end to the situation in which</u>
 the leading organizations accompany the guerrilla units here and there</p>
<p>B: also, leading organizations <i>should stop</i>
 accompanying the guerrilla units wherever they go</p>
<p>["Situation" adds nothing but a more complicated sentence structure. "We must put an end to the situation in which students are late for class" is only a roundabout way of saying "students must stop being late for class."]</p>
<p>5) A: the reason why the contracts are so lifeless and out of gear with actual conditions <u>lies in the fact that</u>
 the trade union leadership didn't understand that...</p>
<p>B: the reason the contracts are so lifeless and unrelated to actual conditions <i>is that</i>
 the trade union leadership didn't understand that...</p>
<p>[Professor Strunk is particularly stern in his condemnation of the expression "the fact that."He says unequivocally [p. 24], "It should be revised out of every sentence in which it occurs."]</p>
<p>6) A: the Civil Aviation Administration of China has decided to start <u>the business of</u>
 advance booking and ticketing on connecting and return flights</p>
<p>B: the Civil Aviation Administration of China has decided to start advance booking and ticketing for connecting and return flights</p>
<p>["The business of" is an unnec. category noun.]</p>
<p>7) A: The efforts... are all focused on <u>the objective of</u>
 effectively <u>strengthening the vitality</u>
 of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises.</p>
<p>B: The efforts... are all focused on <i>revitalizing (or:</i>
 designed to revitalize) large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises.</p>
<p>[-"The objective of" is another unnec. category noun.</p>
<p>-"To strengthen vitality" = "to revitalize" (pattern: unnec. verb + noun).</p>
<p>-("Effectively" was edited out because to "revitalize" means to revitalize "effectively.")]</p>
<p>8) A: the main forces of the East China Field Army marched down south into the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu plains in order to <u>carry out the task</u>
 of fighting on exterior lines</p>
<p>B: the main forces of the East China Field Army marched south into the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu plains to <i>fight</i>
 on exterior lines</p>
<p>[-"To carry out the task of fighting" = "to fight" (pattern: unnec. verb + unnec. noun + third word).</p>
<p>-(Note that "in order" is often superfluous with a following infinitive. )]</p>
<p>9) A: instead of <u>introducing the method</u>
 of confiscation, we have adopted a policy of redemption to change the capitalist ownership</p>
<p>B: instead of <i>confiscating</i>
 property to change capitalist ownership, we have adopted a policy of redeeming it</p>
<p>[-"Introducing the method of confiscation" = "confiscating" (pattern: unnec. verb + unnec. noun + third word).</p>
<p>-"Adopt a policy of" was retained because in this context it is an important element of the meaning, not just a thoughtless cliché.</p>
<p>-Note how changing the nouns "confiscation" and "redemption" to gerunds ("confiscating" and "redeeming") enables us—indeed, requires us—to clarify the sense by adding direct objects ("property" and "it").]</p>
<p>10) A: it is therefore imperative, both politically and economically, to <u>attach importance to</u>
 promoting the work in the old base areas</p>
<p>B: it is therefore imperative, both politically and economically, to <i>promote</i>
 the work in the old base areas</p>
<p>[What is imperative is not to "attach importance to promoting the work" (i. e., to recognize its importance in principle) but to promote it (i. e., to take practical action).]</p>
<p>11) A: we must attach great importance to <u>the role of</u>
 scientific research institutes</p>
<p>B: we must attach great importance to <i>(or:</i>
 recognize the great importance of) scientific research institutes</p>
<p>[-If "the role of" is dropped, the sentence means exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>-But here "attach great importance to" expresses the central idea; it can be modified but not edited out. Compare the use of the same phrase in the preceding example, where it is merely a superfluous introduction to the main action.]</p>
<p>12) A: <u>the target</u>
 of capturing Changsha failed <u>to be achieved</u>
</p>
<p>B: they failed to <i>capture</i>
 Changsha</p>
<p>["To achieve the target of capturing" = "to capture" (pattern: unnec. verb + unnec. noun + third word).]</p>
<p>13) A: the Japanese army concluded that in suppressing the Communist Party the dependence on the armed forces alone could not <u>achieve success</u>
</p>
<p>B: the Japanese army concluded that it could not depend on the armed forces alone to <i>suppress</i>
 the Communist Party</p>
<p>["To achieve success in suppressing" = "to suppress" (pattern: unnec. verb + unnec. noun + third word).]</p>
<p>14) A: in order to accomplish this, <u>an approach</u>
 of gradual transition <u>will be adopted</u>
</p>
<p>B: we <i>shall accomplish this by</i>
 a gradual transition</p>
<p>[-The structure "adopt an approach of" can be dropped without any loss of meaning.</p>
<p>-(The sentence was changed from passive voice—"this will be accomplished"—to active voice—"we shall accomplish this"—in accordance with the English preference. Active voice is more natural, more direct, more forceful, and more readily understood. )</p>
<p>-(Here again, as in example 8, "in order" can be eliminated. )]</p>
<p>15) A: departments of scientific research should <u>take steps to</u>
 <u>make a</u>
 proper <u>readjustment</u>
 of...</p>
<p>B: departments of scientific research should <i>readjust</i>
 ...</p>
<p>[-"Take steps to" is another empty introductory phrase.</p>
<p>-"Make a readjustment" = "readjust" (pattern: unnec. verb + noun).</p>
<p>-(It goes without saying that the readjustment should be "proper.")]</p>
<p>16) A: the national economic strength <u>experienced</u>
 the most rapid <u>increase</u>
 during this period</p>
<p>B: the economy <i>grew</i>
 most rapidly during this period</p>
<p>[-"To experience increase" = "to increase" = "to grow" (pattern: unnec. verb + noun).</p>
<p>-(As in example 3 above, "economic strength" was changed because it is only a further abstraction for "the economy," and "national" was omitted because it can be taken for granted. )]</p>
<p>17) A: <u>the work of</u>
 clearly stipulating their functions, organization and personnel <u>should be done well</u>
</p>
<p>B: their functions, organization and number of personnel <i>should be clearly stipulated</i>

<p>[-"The work of" = unnec. category noun.</p>
<p>-"Should be done well" is a variant of "do a good job."The point here is not that the work should be done well but that it should be done. In any case, the sense of "well" is expressed in "clearly."]</p>
<p>18) A: <u>a</u>
 good <u>job must be done in</u>
 medical-care <u>work</u>
 for the urban residents too</p>
<p>B: good <i>medical care must be provided</i>
 for city people too</p>
<p>[-Here, on the contrary, the point is indeed that the work must be done well, so the standard phrase is not just a mindless addition. It can be tightened by eliminating "job" , but "good" has to be retained.</p>
<p>-Note, incidentally, how the revision turns a vague, abstract statement into one that is precise and concrete.]</p>
<p>19) A: plunging yourselves into practical work is very important for you to <u>find solutions to</u>
 <u>all sorts of</u>
 problems</p>
<p>B: if you want to solve problems, it is important for you to plunge into practical work</p>
<p>[-To "find solutions to" = "to solve" (pattern: unnec. verb + noun).</p>
<p>-Like "a series of," mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, "all sorts of," "various kinds of," etc. are often redundant with a plural noun.</p>
<p>-("Very" was removed because it only weakens the force of "important.")]</p>
<p>20) A: it is essential to <u>make vigorous efforts to</u>
 reform the system for determining the purchasing and selling prices of grain and take further steps to <u>establish the institution</u>
 of regulating the reserves of grain, cotton, and other such major products</p>
<p>B: it is essential to <i>reform</i>
 the system for determining the prices at which the state purchases and sells grain and to take further steps to <i>regulate</i>
 the stockpiling of grain, cotton, and other major (<i>or: basic</i>
 ) products</p>
<p>[-"Make vigorous efforts to" is a variant of "make great efforts to."</p>
<p>-"To establish the institution of regulating" = "to regulate" (pattern: unnec. verb + unnec. noun + third word).</p>
<p>-(The phrase "the purchasing and selling prices of grain" was slightly expanded to make the system of distribution clearer to foreign readers. "Such" was omitted because in this sentence it means the same thing as "major.")]</p>
