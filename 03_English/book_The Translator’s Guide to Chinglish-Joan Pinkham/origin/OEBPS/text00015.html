<h2>X. Dangling Modifiers</h2>
<p>In the last chapter we talked about misplaced modifiers—phrases that function as adjectives or adverbs and that are illogical because they are in the wrong place. As we saw, the usual way to deal with them is simply to change the word order in the sentence.</p>
<p>There is another group of modifiers that are illogical not because of faulty placement but because of faulty grammatical relations with other elements in the sentence. A change in word order, therefore, will not generally suffice to correct them; the translator has to deal with them in other ways. It is modifiers of this sort, which are traditionally called "unattached" or "dangling," that we shall turn to now.</p>
<p>The standard texts and handbooks for students, journalists, and other writers who are native speakers of English list a number of different types of dangling modifiers. In this chapter we shall deal only with those that appear frequently in the work of Chinese translators. There are five of these: three phrases based on verb forms (participles, gerunds, and infinitives), plus prepositional phrases and individual adjectives.</p>
<h3 id="c1">1. Dangling participles</h3>
<p>As you know from your study of English, participles are verb forms that act as adjectives. In regular verbs, the present participle ends in-ing (a <u>pleasing</u>
 child) and the past participle in-ed (a <u>pleased</u>
 child).</p>
<p>Like any adjective, a participle (or participial phrase) needs to be closely linked to the noun or pronoun it modifies. When it is not, it is said to "dangle."The dangling participle is one of the most common mistakes in the writing of native speakers of English, so we should not be surprised that it is frequently found in Chinglish as well.</p>
<p>In the last chapter we discussed a dangling participle, although we did not identify it as such:</p>
<p>-Inside the grand Dacheng Palace in the middle of the Temple of Confucius, musicians will play tunes allegedly refined by Confucius, <u>using antique instruments</u>
 including the stringed <i>guqin.</i>
</p>
<p>In that sentence the participial phrase, which was intended to modify "musicians," attached itself instead to the immediately preceding noun, "Confucius." As you may recall, to make the right logical connection, the reviser moved the phrase to a position next to the noun it belonged to: "<i>musicians,</i>
 using antique instruments, including the stringed <i>guqin,</i>
 will play tunes... ."</p>
<p>This example was included in the category of misplaced modifiers because, to correct it, the reviser had only to change its place in the sentence. But as noted above, in most instances one cannot "fix" a dangling participle simply by repositioning it. Very often, it is not possible to move it next to the word it should modify, because that word is only implied and does not appear in the sentence. And even if the word is present, other grammatical changes are generally required to make the right connection.</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Dangling participles at the beginning of a sentence</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>The difficulty presented by a participle arises most frequently when it stands at the beginning of a sentence. To satisfy the demands of logic, <u>an opening participial phrase must modify the subject of the sentence</u>
 (the subject of the main verb). That subject will normally be the noun or pronoun that comes immediately after the participial phrase.</p>
<p>Before considering examples of faulty construction, let us look at some examples of the correct, established pattern:</p>
<p>-<u>Looking</u>
 back over the past seventy years, <u>the Chinese people</u>
 are more convinced than ever that their choice of socialism as their goal has been correct.</p>
<p>[The present participle "looking" modifies the subject of the sentence: it is the Chinese people who are looking back.]</p>
<p>-<u>Performed</u>
 by the China Youth Art Theater, <u>the play</u>
 describes the different lifestyles, feelings, and concepts of two brothers, one a bricklayer and the other a painter.</p>
<p>[The past participle "performed" modifies the subject of the sentence: it is the play that is being performed.]</p>
<p>-<u>Panicked</u>
 by the flames and <u>seeking</u>
 a way out, <u>residents</u>
 found their escape blocked by iron-barred doors and windows.</p>
<p>[Both participles modify the subject of the sentence: it is the residents who were panicked and who were seeking an exit.]</p>
<p>Readers of sentences like these do not know at first what person or thing the opening participle refers to. But consciously or unconsciously, they expect that that person or thing will be named immediately after, as the subject of the sentence. When their expectation is fulfilled, as in the examples above, the sentence is logical.</p>
<p>Now let us consider two examples in which the word the participle is intended to modify—the word to which it logically refers—is <i>not</i>
 the subject of the sentence.</p>
<p>-<u>Using</u>
 either military or peaceful means, <u>most of the remaining enemy forces</u>
 were put out of action.</p>
<p>[-The subject of this sentence is "most of the enemy forces."But it was not they who were "using either military or peaceful means."Rather, it was "we" (the revolutionary forces) who used those means to put the enemy out of action.</p>
<p>-The word that the present participle "using" is intended to modify is "we," but "we" is not the subject of the sentence—indeed, it is nowhere to be found. So "using" attaches itself instead to the subject provided (the "enemy forces"), producing the wrong meaning.]</p>
<p>-<u>Conveniently situated</u>
 , <u>traffic</u>
 from Jin Hui Tower to Beijing International Airport takes only 1/2 hour via the Third Ring Road.</p>
<p>[-The subject of this sentence is "traffic."But it is not the traffic that is "conveniently situated."</p>
<p>-What the past participle "situated" is meant to modify is the new Jin Hui office building. The word it logically refers to is "Tower," but "Tower" is only the object of the preposition "from," not the subject of the sentence. Again, the participle attaches itself instead to the word that <i>is</i>
 the subject ("traffic"), this time producing nonsense.]</p>
<p>Sentences like these arouse expectations that they fail to meet. Readers assume that when they get to the subject of the sentence they will learn <u>who</u>
 is using military or peaceful means and <u>what</u>
 is conveniently situated. They do not. In the first example they are misinformed, and in the second they are presented with an absurdity.</p>
<p>It is as if the writer had begun with one subject in mind (the revolutionary forces, or the Jin Hui Tower) and then, without giving notice, changed to another (the enemy forces, traffic). Even readers who do get the right meaning will have the uncomfortable feeling that something is wrong. The train of thought that started out in one direction has suddenly switched to another track.</p>
<p>The way to keep the train running along the same track is to establish logical grammatical relations between one idea and the next. To do that, we could revise the two sentences as follows:</p>
<p>-<i>Using either military or peaceful means, we</i>
 put most of the remaining enemy forces out of action.</p>
<p>[The word to which the participle refers ("we") has been introduced and made the subject of the sentence. The subject is now consistent with the opening phrase, so the second idea follows logically from the first.]</p>
<p>-<i>The Jin Hui Tower is conveniently situated (or:</i>
 located), only 1/2 hour from Beijing International Airport via the Third Ring Road.</p>
<p>[The participial phrase has been abandoned and the idea restated as an independent clause. Again, the logic has been straightened out.]</p>
<p>These examples illustrate the two possible ways of recasting a sentence to eliminate a dangling participle. You can either:</p>
<p>-make the word that the participle logically modifies the subject of the sentence, or</p>
<p>-drop the participial phrase and express the idea in another form.</p>
<p>In <i>Modern American Usage</i>
 [p. 117], Wilson Follett sums up the case nicely in a single sentence:</p>
<p>The modern doctrine, which codifies the modern feeling, is that a participle at the head of a sentence automatically affixes itself to the subject of the following verb—in effect a requirement that the writer either make his subject consistent with the participle or discard the participle for some other construction.</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Dangling participles in other positions</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>As we noted at the outset, danglers are most often found at the beginning of a sentence. But participles can also dangle when they appear in other positions.</p>
<p>Here is an example in which the participial phrase comes at the end of the sentence:</p>
<p>A: In recent years, <u>China</u>
 has introduced much technology and equipment from abroad, <u>playing</u>
 an important role in improving its petrochemical technology.</p>
<p>B: In recent years, China has introduced much technology and equipment from abroad, and <i>these imports have played</i>
 an important role in upgrading its petrochemical industry.</p>
<p>[-The principle is the same as if the participial phrase came at the beginning: "<u>Playing</u>
 an important role in improving China's petrochemical technology, <u>China</u>
 has introduced etc."Whether the participle comes at the beginning or the end of the sentence, it attaches itself to the subject ("China").</p>
<p>-As a result, what A-version actually says is that China is playing an important role in improving its own technology. The intended meaning, however, is that the newly introduced technology and equipment are playing an important role.</p>
<p>-Here, the nouns to which the participle logically refers do appear in the sentence: "technology and equipment from abroad."The problem is that those words are not the subject of the verb, "introduced," but its object.</p>
<p>-The polisher found that there was no good way of moving "technology and equipment from abroad" into the position of subject. She therefore changed the participial phrase into an independent clause: "In recent years, China has introduced much technology and equipment from abroad, and the technology and equipment from abroad have played an important role etc."</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : Then, to avoid repetition, she changed the second reference to "technology and equipment from abroad" into "these imports" : "and these imports have played an important role etc.")</p>
<p>-(To avoid the self-evident statement that new technology improves "technology," she also changed "in improving its petrochemical technology" to "in upgrading its petrochemical industry.")]</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Dangling participles that have become acceptable</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>Authorities on English agree that through long usage, certain unattached or dangling participles have become acceptable. Indeed, for practical purposes they have ceased to be participles and have acquired the status of prepositions, conjunctions, or adverbs. Such words have no obligation to cling to a particular noun.</p>
<p>For example, not even the strictest grammarian would object to idiomatic constructions like these:</p>
<p>-Generally <u>speaking</u>
 , cows are amiable creatures.</p>
<p>-<u>Judging</u>
 from the ripple of laughter that went through the hall, the delegates did not take the suggestion seriously.</p>
<p>-Our business should be concluded by the end of the week, <u>barring</u>
 unexpected delays.</p>
<p>-<u>Owing</u>
 to unforeseen circumstances, the administration has been obliged to cancel all music classes today.</p>
<p>-<u>According</u>
 to witnesses, it was after midnight when the accident occurred.</p>
<p>-<u>Provided</u>
 there are no objections, the committee will adjourn tomorrow.</p>
<p>These participles do not modify the subjects of their sentences. The cows are not speaking, the delegates were not judging their own response, our business is not barring delays, etc. Technically, therefore, the participles are dangling. But because they have been used so often in free-standing constructions, they have finally achieved independence. They no longer need to lean on nouns for support, and they display no tendency to attach themselves where they are not wanted. They stand alone, with no offense to logic.</p>
<p>In addition to these examples, certain other participles that have a general, abstract meaning—"concerning," "regarding," "assuming," "allowing for," "granted that," and the like—have achieved independent status. And since the language is constantly evolving, a number of others are in transition.</p>
<p>There is no absolute test to determine whether a given participle has been transformed into another part of speech. It is largely a matter of opinion, and one writer might include in a list of "liberated" participles a word that another, who had stricter standards, might reject or regard as dubious.</p>
<p>In addition, even a participle that all writers would consider completely transformed may at the same time continue to function as a participle. A familiar example of a word that possesses this dual character is "considering."In one sentence it may be used as a preposition and in another as a participle.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>-<u>Considering</u>
 the circumstances, the accused could hardly be blamed for her actions.</p>
<p>-Carefully <u>considering</u>
 the evidence, <u>the accused</u>
 was declared innocent.</p>
<p>In the first sentence, "considering" plainly functions as a preposition, the equivalent of "under," "in light of" or "in view of."It is not attached to the subject, and readers have seen and heard it used in this sense so often that they do not expect it to be.</p>
<p>In the second example, "considering" is perceived as a present participle that wrongly modifies "the accused."When the sentence abruptly changes direction after the comma, a critical reader will feel the jolt and reread, making a mental revision: "Carefully considering the evidence, <i>the jury</i>
 declared the accused innocent."</p>
<p>Thus, the treatment of participles calls for judgment. Translators, especially if they are not native speakers of English, would do well to be conservative in the matter and to restrict their notion of "acceptable" danglers to familiar expressions like the ones cited above. If the status of a participle is in doubt, it is best to assume that it is still a participle and must be firmly tied to an appropriate noun.</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Dangling participles in the English of native speakers</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>The whole notion of what is acceptable and what is not in the usage of participles in English has evolved over time. Until perhaps the end of the nineteenth century, unattached participles were considered permissible, and examples can readily be cited from the work of even the most admired writers of that and earlier times.</p>
<p>But standards have become increasingly strict. It was nearly a hundred years ago that the brothers H. W. and F. G. Fowler [p. 119 ff.] called attention to the shift toward tighter construction. Since then, generations of English teachers have warned students against dangling participles, and the authors of countless handbooks on writing have offered cautionary examples.</p>
<p>For instructional purposes, these authors tend to select examples in which the participle, which lacks all sense of propriety in the choice of a mate, has formed a particularly deplorable attachment. Here are a few:</p>
<p>-<u>Being</u>
 in a dilapidated condition, <u>I</u>
 was able to buy the house very cheap. [Strunk and White, p. 14]</p>
<p>-<u>Wondering</u>
 irresolutely what to do next, <u>the clock</u>
 struck twelve. <i>[Ibid.]</i>
</p>
<p>-Quickly <u>summoning</u>
 an ambulance, <u>the corpse</u>
 was carried to the mortuary. [Barzun, p. 64]</p>
<p>-<u>Roasted</u>
 to perfection, <u>carved</u>
 , and <u>reheated</u>
 in orange sauce, <u>you</u>
 can serve this duck to the boss. [Cook, p. 29]</p>
<p>Yet despite the manifest absurdity of such examples, the defenders of logic have not had much influence on the general public—or even on those persons who, making their living by the use of words, might be supposed to have a particular care for the language.</p>
<p>Here are some dangling participles produced by professional writers:</p>
<p>-<i>From the</i>
 Far Eastern Economic Review, <i>in a review of a book on China by the American journalist Harrison Salisbury:</i>
</p>
<p>
<u>Written</u>
 during the reign of Deng, <u>Salisbury</u>
 relies heavily on sources who support the new New China.</p>
<p>[It is not the author who was written at that time but the book.]</p>
<p>-<i>From the</i>
 International Herald Tribune:</p>
<p>
<u>Based on</u>
 the moderate rate of inflation over the last year, many <u>analysts</u>
 expect an increase in social security benefits of about three percent.</p>
<p>[It is not the analysts that are based on the rate of inflation but their expectation.]</p>
<p>-<i>From a mail-order catalog, in a paragraph describing the origin of a special key case offered for sale:</i>
</p>
<p>
<u>While visiting</u>
 the German factory that makes some of our superb pens, <u>our host</u>
 put his car keys on the conference table.</p>
<p>[Our German host was not visiting his own factory; "we" were the visitors.]</p>
<p>-<i>From a letter to a citizen, signed by a United States Senator:</i>
</p>
<p>
<u>Knowing</u>
 of your interest in El Salvador and your concern over U. S. policy in Central America, <u>you</u>
 will be interested to know that Senator Kennedy and I have introduced [in Congress] a bill which will cut off military and economic aid to El Salvador.</p>
<p>[Naturally, the citizen knew of her own interest in El Salvador. The staff member who drafted the letter for the Senator meant to say that the Senator also knew of it.]</p>
<p>Of course, the very fact that dangling participles are so often seen in print suggests that the grammarians are fighting a losing battle with native speakers of English. Nevertheless, Chinese translators, who do not wish to be suspected of either ignorance or negligence, should be careful to respect the rule.</p>
<h3 id="c2">2. Dangling gerunds</h3>
<p>A gerund, you will recall, is the-ing form of a verb that acts as a noun (<u>pleasing</u>
 a child is easy).</p>
<p>Unlike a participle, which can readily stand alone as an adjective (a <u>pleasing</u>
 child, a <u>pleased</u>
 child), a gerund by itself rarely serves as a modifier. But it is often part of a prepositional phrase that serves as a modifier (<u>by pleasing</u>
 the child, <u>in trying</u>
 to please the child, etc. )</p>
<p>In phrases of this kind the subject of the gerund is not expressed but only implied. (The person who is "pleasing" or "trying" to please the child is not identified. )</p>
<p>Still, when the phrase stands at the beginning, that unexpressed subject must be logically related to the expressed subject of the sentence. Otherwise, like an opening present participle, the gerund will "dangle."The rule here is simple: <u>the implied subject of an opening gerund must be the same as the subject of the sentence</u>
 .</p>
<p>Again, it will be useful to begin with examples of correct structure:</p>
<p>-<u>After occupying</u>
 the county of Tongdao, on the southwest border of Hunan Province, <u>the troops</u>
 entered Guizhou.</p>
<p>[The implied subject of "occupying" is the same as the subject of the sentence: it was the troops who had occupied Tongdao.]</p>
<p>-<u>In establishing</u>
 special economic zones and <u>implementing</u>
 an open policy, <u>we</u>
 must make it clear that our guideline is just that—to open and not to close.</p>
<p>[The implied subject of the two gerunds is the same as the subject of the sentence: it is "we" (the Chinese government) who are establishing the SEZs and implementing the open policy.]</p>
<p>Now, two contrary examples:</p>
<p>-Fortunately, <u>by cutting</u>
 the number of employees, <u>the annual debt</u>
 of the firm has decreased.</p>
<p>[The implied subject of "cutting" is "the firm," but "the firm" is present only as object of the preposition "of."The subject of the sentence is "the annual debt."It is not the debt that has laid off workers.]</p>
<p>-<u>After gaining some experience</u>
 , <u>these measures</u>
 will gradually be introduced in other regions across the country.</p>
<p>[The implied subject of "gaining" is "we" (the government), but the subject of the sentence is "these measures."The measures will not gain any experience.]</p>
<p>The objection to constructions like these is the same as the objection to dangling participles: readers expect a logical continuity of thought. They automatically assume that the writer will be consistent, that he or she will not launch a sentence with one (unspoken) subject in mind and then, without warning, switch to another. Thus, a dangling gerund gives readers the same disconcerting jolt as a dangling participle.</p>
<p>The two possible remedies are also the same: the translator can either make the subject of the sentence consistent with the opening phrase or replace the phrase with another construction:</p>
<p>-Fortunately, <i>by cutting</i>
 the number of employees, <i>the firm</i>
 has reduced its annual debt.</p>
<p>[The implied subject of "cutting" ("the firm") has been made the subject of the sentence.]</p>
<p>-<i>After we have gained some experience,</i>
 these measures will be gradually introduced in other regions across the country.</p>
<p>[The phrase with the gerund has been turned into a subordinate clause with its own expressed subject, "we."]</p>
<p>Like dangling participles, dangling gerunds are most often found at the beginning of a sentence. But they too may occur in other places. Here is an example:</p>
<p>-<u>The Chinese Government and people</u>
 will never accept violations of or interference in China's sovereignty <u>by</u>
 directly or indirectly <u>including</u>
 the Taiwan Straits in the scope of Japan-U. S. defense cooperation, Shen said.</p>
<p>[Even in the middle of the sentence, when it follows the main verb, the gerund phrase, which is adrift without a subject of its own, clings to the subject of the sentence. Thus, it is "the Chinese Government and people" who will never include the Straits in the defense arrangements of Japan and the U. S.]</p>
<p>A solution would be to change the gerund so that "the Chinese Government and people" would be its logical subject:</p>
<p>-<i>The Chinese Government and people</i>
 will never accept violations of or interference in China's sovereignty <i>by allowing</i>
 the Taiwan Straits to be included, directly or indirectly, in the scope of Japan-U. S. defense cooperation, Shen said.</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Dangling gerunds in the English of native speakers</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>These are almost as common as dangling participles. Here are a few examples, drawn from sources that one might expect to be models of correct English:</p>
<p>-<i>From a form letter sent by the President of the United States to recently naturalized citizens:</i>
</p>
<p>
<u>In adopting</u>
 the United States of America as your homeland, <u>I</u>
 want to congratulate you as a new citizen of this nation we hold so dear.</p>
<p>[It was not "I" (President Reagan) who had just adopted a new homeland.]</p>
<p>-<i>From a form letter sent by the U. S. Department of Commerce to all citizens, asking them to fill out census forms and return the forms by mail:</i>
</p>
<p>
<u>By doing so</u>
 , <u>a census taker</u>
 will not have to visit your home.</p>
<p>[The implied subject of "doing so" is "you" (the recipient of the letter), not the census taker, who is the subject of the sentence.]</p>
<p>-<i>From the</i>
 Boston Globe, <i>in a feature story on real estate:</i>
</p>
<p>
<u>After getting directions</u>
 , at least <u>five pairs of eyes</u>
 watched me get back into my red sports car.</p>
<p>[Eyes can express many things, but they cannot ask for or receive driving directions.]</p>
<p>-<i>From the</i>
 International Herald Tribune, <i>in a political commentary by William Safire, the author of a regular column on language:</i>
</p>
<p>
<u>In trying</u>
 to conceal a blunder, real <u>crimes</u>
 have been committed.</p>
<p>[-It was not the crimes that were trying to conceal the blunder but the unnamed persons in the government who had allegedly committed them.</p>
<p>-(Presumably, if confronted with this dangling gerund, Mr. Safire—who is a recognized authority on English but was writing here in a different capacity—would acknowledge it as a "blunder" on his own part. )]</p>
<h3 id="c3">3. Dangling infinitives</h3>
<p>Infinitives and infinitive phrases can also be modifiers. And although they generally give less trouble than participles and gerunds, they too can dangle.</p>
<p>The rule for infinitives is the same as for gerunds: <u>the implied subject of an opening infinitive must be the same as the subject of the sentence</u>
 . Since the correct pattern is the same as for gerunds, a single example will suffice:</p>
<p>-<u>To guarantee</u>
 the establishment and improvement of a socialist market system, <u>we</u>
 must have a complete legal system.</p>
<p>[The implied subject of "to guarantee" is the same as the subject of the sentence: it is "we" (the government) who must guarantee the establishment etc.]</p>
<p>As for the incorrect pattern, we have already seen an example in the last chapter. You may recall exercise 7:</p>
<p>-In order <u>to ensure</u>
 achievement of the Party's political, military and economic objectives, <u>Mao</u>
 emphasized that the Party must first consolidate its ranks.</p>
<p>In that exercise you were asked to recognize that the introductory phrase wrongly modified "emphasized."This suggested that it was Mao's words, rather than the Party's actions, that would ensure achievement of the goals. To attach the phrase to the right verb, "must consolidate," you had to reorder the sentence, moving the phrase into the subordinate clause introduced by "that”—the clause to which it logically belongs:</p>
<p>- Mao emphasized that <i>to ensure</i>
 achievement of its political, military and economic objectives, <i>the Party</i>
 must first consolidate its ranks.</p>
<p>Since a change of word order sufficed to correct the error, this example was classified as a simple misplaced modifier. But it is essentially a dangling infinitive, one that does not conform to the rule about the necessary consistency of subjects. In the original sentence, the implied subject of "to ensure" is "the Party," but the subject of the sentence is "Mao."</p>
<p>Although in that instance, all that was necessary was to rearrange the words, dangling infinitives, like dangling participles, cannot usually be so easily brought to order. Here is a more typical example:</p>
<p>-<u>To lead</u>
 China into the 21st century, <u>efforts</u>
 must also be made to promote cultural and ethical progress, to consolidate the Party, to strengthen unity among China's various ethnic groups, and to maintain political stability.</p>
<p>[The implied subject of "to lead" is again "we," but the subject of the sentence is "efforts."Only people can lead China, not efforts.]</p>
<p>To correct this sentence, we would have to introduce a subject that would match the implied subject of the infinitive:</p>
<p>-<i>To lead</i>
 China into the 21st century, <i>we</i>
 must also promote cultural and ethical progress, consolidate the Party, strengthen unity among various ethnic groups, and maintain political stability.</p>
<p>[(<u>Review</u>
 : "Make efforts to" would be an unnecessary introductory phrase. "China's" can be taken for granted. )]</p>
<p>
<i>
<u>Dangling infinitives in the English of native speakers</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>These are not so common as dangling participles and gerunds. Still, there is one dangling infinitive phrase with which Americans, at least, are only too familiar. It is "in order to serve you better."</p>
<p>This phrase is typically used by banks, post offices, supermarkets, pharmacies, and similar establishments to announce that a burden of some sort is being laid on customers. They are instructed to fill out a form, punch in their 14-digit account number, return their shopping wagon to the designated location, take a seat and wait, or the like.</p>
<p>The phrase "in order to serve you better," intended to persuade customers that this inconvenience is actually in their own interest, is typically left unattached:</p>
<p>-<i>A notice posted in a bank regarding the procedure for depositing money:</i>
</p>
<p>In order <u>to serve</u>
 you better, please <u>fill out</u>
 a deposit slip before approaching the window.</p>
<p>[The implied subject of the infinitive "to serve" is the bank or, more precisely, the bank teller at the window. But the subject of the sentence (the unexpressed subject of the main verb, "fill out") is "you," the customer.]</p>
<p>The faulty grammar disguises faulty reasoning. It is true that if you spend less time at the window filling out a form, the teller will be able to move on sooner to the next person in line. But the suggestion is that you yourself will save time, which is not the case. It is more likely that while you are making out the form before joining the queue, two or three people will line up ahead of you.</p>
<p>A revision of the notice might read:</p>
<p>
<i>To save time for the teller,</i>
 please <i>fill out a deposit slip before approaching the window.</i>
</p>
<p>The subject of the infinitive "to save" would then match the subject of the main verb, "fill out" (both being an unexpressed "you"), and the message would be more candid. But the bank knows that if the request were thus plainly stated, it might arouse resistance.</p>
<p>-<i>From the instructions given by a mail-order company to customers wishing to return a purchase (the "return code" is a number indicating the reason the merchandise is unsatisfactory):</i>
</p>
<p>In order <u>to serve</u>
 you better, simply <u>write the return code</u>
 in the box provided.</p>
<p>[The implied subject of "to serve" is the company, while the (unexpressed) subject of the sentence is "you."]</p>
<p>Again, the logic behind the request is as obscure as the grammar. By taking the time to find and enter the code number on the form, you will be doing the company a service, not the other way around.</p>
<h3 id="c4">4. Prepositional phrases (not based on verb forms)</h3>
<p>Prepositional phrases based on gerunds (“<u>by cutting</u>
 the number of employees”) and on infinitives (“<u>in order to ensure</u>
 achievement”) are not the only ones that need to be related logically to the subjects of their sentences.</p>
<p>Any opening prepositional phrase that acts as an <u>adjective</u>
 will affix itself to the <u>noun or pronoun</u>
 that is the subject of its sentence, in the same manner as an opening participial phrase. And if that subject is not the word the phrase is intended to modify, the effect will be the same as that of a dangling participle.</p>
<p>Here is an example taken from promotional material for Jiangxi Province designed to attract foreign investors:</p>
<p>-<u>With a favorable environment</u>
 and preferential government policies, any <u>investment</u>
 is assured of healthy returns.</p>
<p>The prepositional phrase, which is meant to describe the province, attaches itself instead to the subject of the sentence, "investment."</p>
<p>The two possible solutions for such a problem are the same as for a dangling participle: you can either find the word that the phrase actually modifies and make it the subject of the sentence, or you can convert the phrase into a separate clause:</p>
<p>-<i>With its favorable environment</i>
 and preferential government policies, <i>Jiangxi Province</i>
 ensures that any investment will bring healthy returns.</p>
<p>- <i>Because Jiangxi Province has a favorable environment</i>
 and offers preferential government policies, any investment there is assured of healthy returns.</p>
<p>In the same way, an opening prepositional phrase that acts as an <u>adverb</u>
 will affix itself to the main <u>verb</u>
 in the sentence. That was the problem in one of the examples of misplaced modifiers discussed in the last chapter:</p>
<p>-<u>After years of effort</u>
 , Gao <u>said</u>
 that soil erosion has been brought under control....</p>
<p>In that sentence, you will recall, the introductory phrase attached itself to the verb in the main clause, "said."To connect it to the right verb, "has been brought," we had to move it into the subordinate clause introduced by "that" :</p>
<p>-Gao said that <i>after years of effort,</i>
 soil erosion <i>has been brought</i>
 under control....</p>
<p>Next to prepositional phrases containing gerunds, the ones that are most often left dangling in Chinglish are those introduced by "like" and "as."Following is an example of each, with a suggested revision:</p>
<p>
<i>From an advertisement for a Holiday Inn newly opened in Zhengzhou:</i>
</p>
<p>A: Just <u>like the Crowne Plaza</u>
 [in Beijing], <u>all rooms</u>
 feature an electronic door lock, a private safe, two telephones with IDD....</p>
<p>B: <i>Like the rooms</i>
 in the Crowne Plaza, <i>all those</i>
 in the Holiday Inn feature an electronic door lock, a private safe, two telephones with IDD....</p>
<p>[-In A-version the opening phrase is not logically attached to the subject of the sentence. What is "like" the Crowne Plaza is not "all rooms" but the missing Holiday Inn.</p>
<p>-Replacing "all rooms" with "the Holiday Inn" would have correctly matched the subject to the phrase, so that one hotel was being compared to another: "Just like the Crowne Plaza, the Holiday Inn... ."But that would have made it awkward to manage the rest of the sentence.</p>
<p>-The easiest way to achieve the right match was to change not the subject but the introductory phrase, comparing rooms to rooms: "Just like the rooms in the Crowne Plaza, all those in the Holiday Inn... ."</p>
<p>-("Just" was omitted as unnecessary. )]</p>
<p>
<i>From the remarks of a high Party cadre:</i>
</p>
<p>A: <u>As leaders</u>
 , <u>it</u>
 is necessary to get a clear picture of the problems and work out measures to solve them.</p>
<p>B: <i>As leaders, we</i>
 must get a clear picture of the problems and work out measures to solve them.</p>
<p>[In A-version, the opening phrase has no logical connection with the following "it."Readers expect that the subject of the sentence will tell them who these leaders are—"we," "you," "they," "senior cadres," or whatever persons the term refers to. In the revision, the correct subject is provided.]</p>

<u>Dangling prepositional phrases in the English of native speakers</u>
</i>
</p>
<p>A few examples, taken from sources on both sides of the Atlantic:</p>
<p>-<i>From the British</i>
 Manchester Guardian Weekly, <i>in a review of a show of work by the American painter Andy Warhol:</i>
</p>
<p>But <u>like Rivera</u>
 , <u>one of his publicly exhibited works</u>
 , "Thirteen Most Wanted Men," was sufficiently offensive to bourgeois tastes that it was painted over after being briefly exhibited at the 1964 New York World's Fair.</p>
<p>[As in the Crowne Plaza example above, the opening phrase is not logically attached to the subject of the sentence. What, in the opinion of the reviewer, was "like" the famous Mexican painter Diego Rivera was not one of Andy Warhol's works but the missing Andy Warhol himself. The comparison should have been either Rivera/Warhol or Rivera's work/Warhol's work.]</p>
<p>-From a letter from a major U. S. credit card company to a cardholder:</p>
<p>
<u>As a valued MasterCard Gold customer</u>
 , <u>we</u>
 are pleased to inform you that we have increased the credit limit of your MasterCard Gold account to the amount shown above.</p>
<p>[On reading the opening phrase, the recipient of the letter confidently expected that she herself was to be named as the valued customer. Her expectation was disappointed.]</p>
<p>-<i>From an advertisement in a publication of the American Association of Retired Persons:</i>
</p>
<p>
<u>As a pharmacist</u>
 for many years, <u>my customers</u>
 appreciate the benefits of garlic. As a consumer for even longer, I also appreciate the benefits of saving money.</p>
<p>[In the first sentence the pharmacist confuses himself with his customers. Plainly, what he meant to say was, "<i>As a pharmacist</i>
 for many years, <i>I</i>
 have found that my customers appreciate etc."In the second sentence he got the construction right.]</p>
<p>-<i>From an article in the</i>
 Los Angeles Times <i>concerning women's fashions in Washington, D. C. :</i>
</p>
<p>
<u>With little time to shop</u>
 or even to think about <u>her</u>
 wardrobe, and the threat of social censure if <u>she</u>
 takes fashion risks, a universally acceptable <u>uniform</u>
 would be a blessing.</p>
<p>[Thanks to "her" and "she," throughout the long introductory phrase the reader is convinced that the subject of this sentence is the professional woman in need of something safe to wear on all occasions. At "uniform," the train of thought does not merely give a jolt, it is completely derailed. Logically, there is only one possible way to complete the sentence: "With little time to shop... and the threat of social censure if she takes fashion risks, <i>she</i>
 would consider a universally acceptable uniform a blessing.”]</p>
<h3 id="c5">5. Individual adjectives</h3>
<p>Lastly, individual adjectives in an initial position, ones that are not part of prepositional phrases, can also dangle when they do not modify the subject of the sentence.</p>
<p>This faulty construction is less common than the others we have discussed, but here is an example from a Chinese publication:</p>
<p>-<u>Tall and shy</u>
 , Diana's stylish <u>gowns</u>
 were recently auctioned off for $5. 7 million.</p>
<p>[The adjectives, meant to describe Diana, attach themselves instead to the subject of the sentence, "gowns."]</p>
<p>Since the word the adjectives are intended to modify appears in the sentence, we could simply change the word order:</p>
<p>-The stylish gowns of <i>tall, shy</i>
 Diana were recently auctioned off for $5. 7 million.</p>
<p>Another solution would be to put the adjectives in a separate subordinate clause:</p>
<p>-The stylish gowns of Diana, <i>who was tall and shy,</i>
 were recently auctioned off for $5. 7 million.</p>
<p>Both of these versions are grammatically correct but have little else to recommend them. The basic difficulty is that in this context the Princess's height and alleged shyness are irrelevant, and the revisions only make this more apparent. The only way to make such a sentence truly logical is to drop the adjectives entirely:</p>
<p>-Diana's stylish gowns were recently auctioned off for $5. 7 million.</p>

 23 per cent and 30 per cent respectively over the same period in 1986.</p>
<p>[-In A-version, the participle ("rising"), even though it is not in opening position, attaches itself to the subject of the sentence ("the procuratorate"). This produces a meaning that contradicts common sense: what has risen is not the procuratorate but the number of crimes investigated.</p>
<p>-In the revision the participle has been replaced by "an increase of" (an abbreviated form of "which is an increase of").</p>
<p>-("Dereliction crimes" was replaced by the standard English term, "crimes of negligence.")</p>

<p>B: In the 1990s <i>China, which boasts</i>
 the world's third largest energy reserves after the United States and Russia, ranks first in output of coal, second in output of electricity, and fifth in output of crude oil.</p>
<p>[-In A-version there are two clauses with two separate subjects: a main clause, the subject of which is "China's output of coal," and a subordinate clause introduced by "while," the subject of which is "crude oil output."</p>
<p>-In such a case, the participle must modify not the subject of the sentence (since there are two of them) but the subject of <u>the clause to which it belongs</u>
 .</p>
<p>-The word the participle ("boasting") should logically modify is "China," but the subject of the clause to which it belongs is "China's output of coal."It is not the output of coal that is "boasting."</p>
<p>-In the revision, the subject of the main clause has been changed from "China's output" to "China."This gave "boasting" the right noun to modify, but the polisher still thought it better to convert the participial phrase into a subordinate clause ("which boasts").</p>
<p>-("Leads the world" was changed to "ranks first" in order to put the three figures in comparable form. They were then rearranged in a logical descending order: China ranks first in x, second in y, fifth in z. )]</p>
<p>3) A: Many scattered <u>liberated areas</u>

 the people's armed forces to take the initiative militarily.</p>
<p>B: Many scattered liberated areas were linked up, <i>which enabled (or:</i>
 which made it possible for) the people's armed forces to take the initiative militarily.</p>
<p>[-A-version seems logical enough at first, but it does not bear close examination. The participle ("enabling") does not refer to the subject of the sentence ("liberated areas"). It is not the "scattered liberated areas" that enabled the people's armed forces to take the initiative but the linking of those areas.</p>
<p>-In B-version the participial phrase has been turned into a subordinate clause introduced by "which."</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : Here the relative pronoun "which" plainly refers to the entire main clause immediately preceding: "Many scattered liberated areas were linked up.")]</p>

<p>B: Gradually <i>they</i>
 turned guerrilla warfare into mobile warfare, <i>creating</i>
 the conditions necessary for a full-scale counter-offensive.</p>
<p>[-This sentence, like the preceding one, is understandable, but it does not actually say what it means.</p>
<p>-Again, the participle ("creating") does not refer to the subject of the sentence ("guerrilla warfare"). It is not "guerrilla warfare" that created the conditions for a counter-offensive but the change of tactics on the part of the revolutionary army—the gradual transition from guerrilla warfare to mobile warfare.</p>
<p>-This time the main verb was changed to active voice and given a subject that the participle could logically refer to. In B-version it is "they" (the people's armed forces, mentioned at the end of the preceding sentence) who have created the necessary conditions by turning guerrilla warfare into mobile warfare.</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : Since "the people's armed forces" appears at the end of the immediately preceding sentence, the pronoun "they" has a clear antecedent. )]</p>
<p>5) A: The Liaoxi-Shenyang campaign lasted 52 days, and 472, 000 enemy troops were wiped out. From this time onward, <u>the PLA</u>

<p>B: During the 52 days of the Liaoxi-Shenyang campaign, 472, 000 enemy troops were wiped out. From this time onward, the PLA was numerically superior to the KMT, <i>a change that marked</i>
 another turning point in the Chinese revolution.</p>
<p>[-In A-version the participle ("bringing") wrongly attaches itself to the subject of the sentence ("the PLA"). It was not the PLA that brought the revolution to another turning point but the change in the relative strength of the two opposing forces.</p>
<p>-The polisher first introduced the missing word for the participle to modify: "... the PLA was numerically superior to the KMT, a change bringing another turning point in the Chinese revolution."</p>
<p>-Then, because that version was awkward, she replaced the participial phrase with a subordinate clause introduced by "that" : "a change that brought another turning point in the Chinese revolution."</p>
<p>-Lastly, considering that this was neither idiomatic nor logical (nothing "brings" a turning point), she substituted "a change that marked another turning point etc."</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : In A-version the two ideas in the first sentence—the length of the campaign and the number of enemy troops wiped out—are presented in two coordinate clauses, as if they were of equal importance. But since in this context the length of the campaign is only of secondary interest, in the revision it was relegated to a prepositional phrase—“During the 52 days etc.”)]</p>
<p>6) A: The expansion of the productive forces was ignored, and <u>policies</u>
 were formulated <u>neglecting</u>
 the realities of the primary stage of socialism.</p>
<p>B: No attempt was made to expand the productive forces, and <i>the policies we formulated were too ambitious</i>
 for the primary stage of socialism.</p>
<p>[-In A-version the participle ("neglecting") belongs to the second clause, introduced by "and."The subject of that clause is "policies," and it is "policies" that the participle appears to modify. Logically, however, it was not the "policies" that were "neglecting" the realities but the unmentioned policy-makers.</p>
<p>-To revise the sentence, the polisher first replaced the participle ("neglecting") with a prepositional phrase ("without regard for the realities"), at the same time changing the clause to active voice: "we formulated policies without regard for the realities of the primary stage of socialism."</p>
<p>-(That version was grammatically acceptable, but it was still vague. A second polisher, after studying the Chinese again for context, was able to make a further improvement. She changed the general statement "we formulated policies without regard for the realities," which says only that the policies were unsuitable, to the more specific "the policies we formulated were too ambitious," which explains why they were unsuitable. )</p>

<p>B: <i>Since the enterprise was suffocated</i>
 by huge debts and overstaffing, its decision-makers have persuaded more than 25, 000 workers, one quarter of the total, to give up their original jobs in the mines.</p>
<p>[-Plainly, in A-version the participial phrase ("suffocated by huge debts etc.") is intended to modify either "the firm" or "the enterprise."But since neither of those nouns is the subject of the sentence, the phrase attaches itself to the one that is: "workers."Thus, readers are led to believe that it is the 25, 000 workers who are "suffocated by huge debts."</p>
<p>-This erroneous interpretation is all the more plausible because workers in a failing enterprise might indeed be heavily in debt. Readers are well into the sentence before they realize they have been misled.</p>
<p>-In the revision, the participial phrase was simply discarded and replaced by a subordinate clause introduced by "Since."(This had the further advantage of putting the verb in active voice. )</p>

<p>B: "<i>On the basis of</i>
 the current situation, we <i>chose</i>
 apartments as our first property investment here," said Benson Lam, executive director of Dynamic Holdings Co.</p>
<p>[-In A-version the participial phrase "based on" is used as if it had already become a prepositional phrase. It has not, and the result of treating it as independent is an illogical statement: it is not the company ("we") that is based on the current situation but the company's decision.</p>
<p>-In B-version the participial phrase has been replaced by a true prepositional phrase, "on the basis of," which acts as an adverb correctly attached to the main verb, "chose."</p>
<p>-(Note that a number of other expressions could also have been used: "in view of," "in light of," "considering," etc. "Based on" could even have been replaced by another past participle. "Having studied," for example, would have been perfectly acceptable, because it would have logically modified the subject, "we.")]</p>
<p>9) A: <u>Compared</u>

 too soon to exercise unified management of financial and economic work at present.</p>
<p>B: <i>If we consider</i>
 the length of time it took for financial and economic work to be unified within each separate liberated area, it may indeed seem too soon to try to unify it nationwide.</p>
<p>[-In A-version the opening participle ("Compared") does not modify the subject of the main clause, to which it belongs ("it," representing "to exercise unified management"). "Compared" is floating unattached because it has nothing to modify—no other "pace" is compared with the pace at which the work was unified.</p>
<p>-In B-version the participial phrase "Compared with etc."has been converted to a subordinate clause ("If we consider etc.").</p>
<p>-("Nationwide" was added to clarify the sense by underlining the contrast between unification in a single liberated area and unification throughout the country. )</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : "Exercise unified management," an unnec. verb + noun structure, was reduced to "unify."The second reference to "financial and economic work" was replaced by the pronoun "it.""At present" was eliminated as redundant with the present tense of the verb "it may seem.")]</p>

 the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the actual realities of the country can <u>Marxism-Leninism</u>
 be enriched and developed.</p>
<p>B: A country's revolution and construction depend on the practice of the people of that country. Only <i>if the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism are integrated</i>
 with the realities of the country can Marxism-Leninism be enriched and developed.</p>
<p>[-In A-version it is not clear just who is supposed to be the subject of "by integrating"—an implied "we" in general or "the people of each country."</p>
<p>-The subject of the sentence is "Marxism-Leninism," and the gerund tries to attach itself to that subject. But "Marxism-Leninism" cannot integrate its own truths.</p>
<p>-In the revision the gerund phrase "by integrating" has been turned into a subordinate clause ("if the universal truths are integrated"). The verb was deliberately left in passive voice to keep the subject vague, as it was in the Chinese.</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : "Actual" was omitted as a superfluous intensifier. )]</p>
<p>11) A: The world is vast and things are complicated, but <u>after analyzing</u>
 the situation, there are only <u>a few people</u>
 who support war, and most people want peace and oppose war.</p>
<p>B: The world is vast and complex, but <i>if you analyze</i>
 the situation you will find there are only a few people who support war; most people want peace.</p>
<p>[-In A-version the sentence has no one subject, because there are several clauses, each with its own subject.</p>
<p>-In such a case, the rule for gerunds is the same as the one for participles in sentences having more than one clause (see example 2 above): the implied subject of the gerund must be the same as the subject of <u>the clause to which it belongs</u>
 .</p>
<p>-Here the gerund phrase "after analyzing" belongs to the second independent clause, introduced by "but."The unexpressed subject of "analyzing" ("you," meaning the persons being addressed) should therefore be the same as the subject of the second clause. That subject, however, is "a few people."It is not "a few people" who are "analyzing the situation."</p>
<p>-First the polisher changed the gerund phrase to a different construction—a subordinate clause with its own subject: "but if you analyze the situation, there are only a few people who support war."</p>
<p>-But that version did not seem quite right: she felt there was an element missing. She therefore spelled out the meaning in full: "but if you analyze the situation you will find there are only a few people who support war."</p>
<p>-(<u>Review</u>
 : "There are only a few people who support war, and most people want peace and oppose war" is a classic example of saying the same thing twice—indeed, three times. "And oppose war" was eliminated as plain redundancy, but "most people want peace" was allowed to stand for emphasis. )]</p>

<p>[-In A-version, the implied subject of "reforming and restructuring" is "we" (the government), while the subject of the sentence is "upgrading."</p>
<p>-In B-version, the correct subject of the sentence has been introduced ("we"), to match the implied subject of the gerunds.</p>
<p>-(Also, in A-version the relation between "reforming and restructuring" and "the focus for technological renovation" is vague at best. In the revision, the logical connections between the various elements of the sentence have been clarified. The structure now is: in doing x, we should concentrate on y, in order to achieve z.</p>

 should upgrade techniques and equipment, improve testing and experimental facilities....</p>
<p>[-"In so doing" is a handy device for subordinating one idea to another and at the same time avoiding repetition, but it is often left dangling in Chinglish.</p>
<p>-Here, "In so doing" stands for "in concentrating on technological renovation."Its implied subject is therefore the same "we" as in the preceding sentence ("we should concentrate on"). In A-version, however, the subject of the clause in which the phrase appears is not "we" but "techniques and equipment."</p>
<p>-The solution is the same as in example 12: the implied subject of the gerund ("we") has been made the expressed subject of the clause.]</p>

<p>B: In late May 1989 I said that we should boldly choose for the new leadership persons who were generally recognized as adhering to the line of reform and opening up and who had some achievements in that respect to their credit. <i>This would convince the people</i>
 that we were wholeheartedly committed to that line.</p>
<p>[-The problem in A-version is exactly the same as in the example just above. "By so doing" stands for "by boldly choosing etc. ," so its implied subject is the same "we" as in the preceding sentence ("we should boldly choose"). But the subject of the main clause in which the phrase appears is not "we" but "people."</p>
<p>-This time, the reviser chose to drop the gerund phrase ("By so doing") and replace it with a clause introduced by "this," referring to the whole preceding sentence: "This would convince the people that etc."</p>
<p>-Another solution would have been to make the implied subject of the gerund the expressed subject of the clause it belonged to, as was done in the last two examples: "By so doing, we would show the people that etc."</p>

</p>
<p>[-In A-version the implied subject of the gerund "examining" is "we" (Party members), while the subject of the sentence is "certain persons' views.""Views" cannot examine our work.</p>
<p>-In the revision the possessive adjective "persons'" has been converted into a noun, "persons," and made the subject of the main clause. Since the "certain persons" are some of the Party members participating in the examination, the subject of the clause is now consistent with the subject of the gerund.]</p>
<p>16) A: A person's ideological <u>problems</u>

<p>B: The only way <i>a person can solve</i>
 his ideological problems <i>is to</i>
 gradually <i>raise</i>
 his political consciousness and <i>remold</i>
 himself through studying and thinking.</p>
<p>[-In A-version it is not clear who or what is the subject of the first gerund, "by raising."Plainly, it is not the "problems" (the subject of the sentence), but is it the person in question or his comrades who are trying to help him?</p>
<p>-To clarify the meaning, the reviser turned "by raising" into an infinitive whose subject is the "person" himself: "the only way a person can solve his ideological problems is to gradually raise his political consciousness etc."</p>

<p>B: <i>To reach</i>
 a more objective conclusion, he said, <i>people studying</i>
 religion in China should consider the history and culture of the various ethnic groups and other aspects of their background.</p>
<p>[-In A-version the unspoken subject of the infinitive phrase ("To reach a more objective conclusion") is the people studying religion in China. But those people are never mentioned.</p>
<p>-Readers expect that when they reach the subject of the sentence they will learn who it is that wants to reach a more objective conclusion. Instead, they find "backgrounds."</p>
<p>-The word that the participle "studying" should modify is also the absent "people."Having nothing sensible to attach itself to, the participle is adrift just like the infinitive.</p>
<p>-In B-version the polisher has introduced the missing word "people" and made it the subject of the sentence. That subject now conforms to the implied subject of "To reach" and also serves as a logical anchor for "studying."</p>
<p>-("Historical, cultural, and other backgrounds" was changed to "history and culture... and other aspects of their background" because a group does not have plural "backgrounds.")]</p>
<p>18) A: From the military point of view, in order <u>to carry</u>

<p>B: From the military point of view, Mao analyzed the <i>methods</i>
 that the PLA had been using and <i>that would enable it to carry</i>
 the War of Liberation to a victorious conclusion.</p>
<p>[-In A-version the implied subject of the infinitive phrase is "the PLA," but the subject of the sentence is "Mao."The phrase is intended to indicate the reason for the PLA's choice of methods, not the reason for Mao's analysis. That is, it should modify "used by," not "analyzed."</p>
<p>-To make the right logical connection, the polisher had only to move the phrase to the end of the sentence: "From the military point of view, Mao analyzed the methods used by the PLA to carry the War of Liberation to a successful conclusion."</p>
<p>-(Referring back to the Chinese, he then decided that a further change was needed to accurately convey the meaning of the original. "The methods used by the PLA to carry the War of Liberation to a victorious conclusion" became "the methods that the PLA had been using and that would enable it to carry the War of Liberation to a successful conclusion.")]</p>

 who has worked for decades for the communist cause and for the independence, reunification, development, and reform of the country, my life belongs to the Party and the country.</p>
<p>[-In this passage, the "veteran Party member" is speaking about himself.

<p>-When they reach "my life"—jolt. The speaker has apparently started with one subject in mind and then suddenly switched to another.</p>
<p>-Since the opening prepositional phrase ("As a veteran Party member etc.") does not accord with the subject of the sentence ("my life"), it dangles just as a participle would in the same position ("Being a veteran Party member... my life belongs to the Party etc.").</p>
<p>-In B-version the prepositional phrase has been abandoned in favor of a subordinate clause: "Since I am a veteran Party member etc."</p>

<p>20) A: Once <u>on a trip to Shandong</u>
 , <u>my host</u>
 announced that he was treating us to a special flavor.</p>
<p>B: Once <i>when I was on a trip to Shandong,</i>
 my host announced that he was treating us to a special dish.</p>
<p>[-Although we are dealing here with a prepositional phrase, the principle is the same as in the example of a dangling participle cited earlier (from a native speaker): "While visiting the German factory... our host put his car keys on the conference table."</p>
<p>-In both instances, despite grammatical appearances, the host was on home ground and only the speaker was traveling.</p>
<p>-In B-version the abbreviated prepositional phrase has been fully spelled out as a subordinate clause ("when I was on a trip"), which allows of no misunderstanding.</p>
<p>-(The "special flavor" turned out to be steamed cornbread and was therefore changed to the more idiomatic "a special dish.")]</p>
<h3 id="c7">Twenty exercises</h3>
<p>Each of the following exercises contains at least one dangling modifier. If you first identify the suspect phrase—usually at the beginning of the sentence—and the subject of the clause in which it appears, you will be well on the way to solving the problem.</p>
<p>As we have seen, it is usually easiest to correct a dangling modifier by changing the subject of the clause. If that is not practical, consider changing the dangler itself into some other construction—a subordinate clause introduced by "since," "if," "which," or the like, or perhaps a prepositional phrase. (In one of the exercises, you have only to delete the unattached participle. )</p>
