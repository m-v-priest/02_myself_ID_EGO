<title>Part One: Unnecessary Words</title>

<h1>Part One: Unnecessary Words</h1>
<p>All authorities on the style of English prose agree that good writing is concise. Careful writers say what they mean in as few words as possible.</p>
<p><a id="a1"></a>
 A classic statement of this precept appears in the famous little book of William Strunk, Jr., and E. B. White, <i>The Elements of Style</i>

 Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.</p>
<p>It follows that any words which perform no useful function in the sentence—that is, which add nothing to the meaning—should be edited out.</p>
<p>Almost every text that has been translated into English from Chinese, (or that has been written directly in English by a native speaker of Chinese) contains unnecessary words. Draft translations are commonly full of them, and even polished final versions are seldom free of them.</p>
<p>Read anything that has been published in English for foreign readers—a magazine article, a news story, an advertisement, a government report—and you are likely to find superfluous words. Read even the shortest of English texts—the label on a food product, a billboard on Chang'an, the company name on the front of a building—and, if you are on the alert to recognize them, chances are that you will find words that could and should have been omitted. Unnecessary words are the hallmark of Chinglish.</p>
<p>The late Sol Adler was the most distinguished practitioner of the English language who ever turned his attention to "polishing" in China. One of his most frequent marginal comments on translations of the works of Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, and other leaders was a laconic "Unnec."</p>
<p>"Unnec."words can be any part of speech—nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, articles, and so on. In the following chapters we shall consider the most important types, starting with unnecessary nouns and verbs, which often go hand in hand.</p>
