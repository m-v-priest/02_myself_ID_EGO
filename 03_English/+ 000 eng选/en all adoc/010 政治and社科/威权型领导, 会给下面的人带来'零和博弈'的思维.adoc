#威权型领导,# 其带来的负面影响是: #会给下面的人, 带来"零和博弈"的思维.# 即, 他们会变得更不可能帮助别人, 而相信“只有牺牲掉他人, 自己才能致富”. +
我们发现，#与刚刚看过"声望型"领导者的参与者相比，看过"强势"领导者的参与者, 更容易表现出零和心态，也不太可能帮助他人。老板的性别没有影响#：作为老板无论男女, 都减少了参与者的乐于助人, 并增加了他们的"零和思维"思想。

== How Dominant Leaders Go Wrong


A leader's hyperindividualist approach can foster a zero-sum mindset in which people believe they can progress only at the expense of others.

We found that participants who had watched a dominant leader were more prone to express a zero-sum mindset and less likely to help others, compared with participants who had just watched a prestige leader. Gender had no effect: dominant men and women as bosses reduced helpfulness and increased zero-sum thinking among participants.
