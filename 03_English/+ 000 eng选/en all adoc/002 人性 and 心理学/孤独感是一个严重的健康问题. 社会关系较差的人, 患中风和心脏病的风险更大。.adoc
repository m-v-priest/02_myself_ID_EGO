Recent research suggests that American have become less active with organized religion, community organizations and even their own family members. Research also shows Americans have reported an increase in feelings of loneliness. In addition to that, the number of households with a single unmarried person has doubled in the last 60 years.

Americans spent about 20 minutes a day in person with friends in 2020, down from 60 minutes a day 20 years earlier.



The loneliness epidemic is especially affecting young people aged 15 to 24. The age group reported a 70 percent drop in time spent with friends during the same period.

Murthy said technology has increased loneliness. One study in the report researched people who used social media for two hours or more a day. It found that the group was more than twice as likely to report feeling a lack in social connection than those who spent less than 30 minutes a day on social media.

Murthy said there is no replacement for in-person interaction. He added that Americans are using technology more for communication. He wondered: “We lost out on a lot of that in-person interaction. How do we design technology that strengthens our relationships as opposed to weaken them?”
