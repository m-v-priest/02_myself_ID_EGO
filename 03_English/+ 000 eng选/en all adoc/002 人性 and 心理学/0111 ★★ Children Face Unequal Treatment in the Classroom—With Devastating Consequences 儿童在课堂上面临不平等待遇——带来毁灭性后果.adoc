== Children Face (v.) Unequal Treatment in the Classroom — With Devastating (a.)破坏性极大的；毁灭性的 Consequences 儿童在课堂上面临不平等待遇——带来毁灭性后果

On one occasion, an 11-year-old boy named Mark received _a six out of 10_ on a test 后定 he had taken a week earlier.  +
In response to his disappointment, the boy’s teacher said, “It’s okay, Mark — not everyone has to be an Einstein.” +


[.my2]
====
有一次，一个名叫马克的 11 岁男孩在一周前参加的测试中得到了 6 分（满分 10 分）。对于他的失望，男孩的老师说：“没关系，马克——不是每个人都必须成为爱因斯坦。”
====



Why, I wondered, did the teacher conclude that Mark wasn’t an Einstein? That comment made (v.) Mark’s grade  成绩等级；评分等级 `宾补` entirely a function of his innate (a.)天生的；先天的；与生俱来的 ability. +
Why didn’t the teacher consider the external 外界的；外来的；在外的 conditions — such as the lack of a place to study — that *prevented* (v.) Mark *from* fulfilling (v.)实现;履行；执行 his potential? +


[.my2]
====

我想知道，为什么老师得出马克不是爱因斯坦的结论？这个评论使马克的成绩完全取决于他与生俱来的能力。为什么老师没有考虑到阻碍马克发挥潜力的外部条件（例如缺乏学习场所）？

Even well-intentioned 用意良好的 (但却常事与愿违) educators may unknowingly 不知不觉地 send (v.) discouraging 使人沮丧的；令人气馁的 messages to children 后定 from disadvantaged 弱势的；社会地位低下的 backgrounds.  +

I have drawn on 凭借；利用；动用 multiple studies to examine this problem and have shown how these messages can become ingrained (a.)根深蒂固的；日久难改的;把...深深地印在头脑中; 渗入 in children’s mind.  +
In the process, socioeconomic 社会经济学的 inequality becomes deeply etched (v.)蚀刻，凿出（玻璃、金属等上的文字或图画） into each child’s perceptions  知觉；感知 of themselves — with lasting (a.) and serious repercussions  （间接的）影响，反响，恶果.

[.my2]
即使是善意的教育者, 也可能在不知不觉中, 向来自弱势背景的孩子传递令人沮丧的信息。我利用多项研究来检验这个问题，并展示了这些信息如何在儿童的头脑中根深蒂固。在此过程中，社会经济不平等深深地烙印在每个孩子的自我认知中，并产生持久而严重的影响。

Inferring (v.)推断；推论；推理 a student’s ability isn’t easy. Often teachers face (v.)ambiguity  (n.)模棱两可；不明确 : a student may do well on some tests and poorly on others.  +
In those cases, educators may be guided by stereotypes — _generalized (a.)笼统的；普遍的；概括性的；全面的 beliefs_ about a social group.  +

A child’s gender, race 人种(描述的是身体特征,生物学特征) and ethnicity (描述的是文化认同), for example, may all influence (v.) the teacher’s evaluations 评价，评估. Socioeconomic status 社会经济地位 may do so *as well*.  +

Years of research find a pervasive (a.)遍布的；充斥各处的；弥漫的 negative stereotype about the intellectual 智力的；脑力的；理智的 abilities of children from a poorer background: irrespective (a.)不考虑，不顾 of their actual abilities, they are generally perceived  (v.)将…理解为；将…视为；认为 as less smart than other children.


[.my2]
====

推断学生的能力并不容易。教师经常面临模棱两可的情况：学生可能在某些测试中表现良好，而在其他测试中表现不佳。在这些情况下，教育工作者可能会受到刻板印象（关于社会群体的普遍信念）的指导。例如，孩子的性别、种族和民族, 都可能影响老师的评价。社会经济地位也可能如此。多年的研究发现，对于来自贫困家庭的孩子的智力能力, 存在着普遍的负面刻板印象：无论他们的实际能力如何，他们通常被认为不如其他孩子聪明。
====

A study in the U.K. found that when teachers evaluate (v.)估计；评价；评估 their students’ work, they tend to give lower grades to those from a poorer background, even when these students perform (v.) as well as their peers.  +

And another investigation — with data from Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland — determined (v.)查明；测定；准确算出 that teachers tend to disproportionately 不成比例地 *assign* (v.)分配（某物）；分派，布置（工作、任务等）;确定（价值、功能、时间、地点） students from a disadvantaged background *to* _lower-level, vocational 职业的；职业技术的；业务知识的 tracks_ at the end of elementary school 小学毕业的时候, even when these students have _similar test scores and grades_(n.) 等级,分数 as their classmates.


[.my2]
====

英国的一项研究发现，当老师评估学生的作业时，他们往往会给出身较差的学生打较低的分数，即使这些学生的表现与同龄人一样好。另一项调查——根据来自比利时、法国、德国、荷兰和瑞士的数据——确定，教师倾向于在小学结束时, 不成比例地将来自弱势背景的学生, 分配到较低水平的职业轨道，即使这些学生具有相似的能力。与同学一样的考试成绩和成绩。
====


We then coded (v.) the comments 后定 that teachers wrote /and found that while `主` the students from high and low socioeconomic backgrounds `谓` received roughly the same amount of praise, teachers *lavished* (v.)过分给予；滥施 the students from a poorer background *with* more inflated (a.)夸张的；言过其实的 approval such as “Amazing! You did incredibly (ad.)令人难以置信; 极端地；极其 well!”  +

They did so because they assumed these students had to work harder to achieve their success.


[.my2]
====

我们对老师写的评论进行了编码，发现, 虽然来自高社会经济背景的学生, 和低社会经济背景的学生, 都获得了大致相同数量的表扬，但老师们却给了来自较贫困背景的学生更多夸大的认可，例如“太棒了！你做得非常好！”他们这样做, 是因为他们认为这些学生必须更加努力, 才能取得成功。
====

In a second experiment 实验；试验 with 63 students aged 10 to 13 years, we found that the kids were very attuned (a.) 熟悉；适应；习惯 to teachers’ language.  +
They inferred (v.)推断；推论；推理 that /a student who received inflated praise was more hardworking (a.)努力工作的 but less smart than others.  +

Thus, even well-intentioned (a.)好意的，好心的；出于善意的 praise can reinforce (v.)加强；充实；使更强烈 the belief that `主` children from a disadvantaged background `系`  are less competent (a.)足以胜任的；有能力的；称职的;合格的；尚好的 than their peers.

2.of a good standard but not very good 合格的；不错的；尚好的 +

然而孩子们很容易理解潜在的信息。在对 63 名 10 至 13 岁学生进行的第二次实验中，我们发现孩子们非常适应老师的语言。他们推断，受到夸大表扬的学生比其他人更勤奋，但聪明程度较低。因此，即使是善意的表扬也会强化这样的信念：来自弱势背景的孩子不如同龄人。

Once these self-views are established, they remain relatively  相当程度上；相当地；相对地 stable across one’s life span, which means that children can carry these negative ideas about their own ability and potential (n.) into adulthood.

[.my2]
随着时间的推移，这些无意中的诽谤性信息, 可能会在孩子们的脑海中根深蒂固。正如我和其他人发现的那样，社会经济背景较低的孩子, 往往对自己有更多的负面看法。他们认为自己不太聪明，不太能够发展自己的智力，不值得和无价值的——即使他们和其他人一样聪明和成就很高。这些自我观一旦建立起来，就会在人的一生中保持相对稳定，这意味着孩子们可以将这些关于自己能力和潜力的负面想法, 带到成年。

Self-views are consequential 重要的；将产生重大结果的. Children who hold negative self-views may avoid challenges, give up in the face of setbacks (n.)挫折；阻碍 and underperform (v.)发挥不够；表现不理想 under pressure.  +
Consequently 因此；所以, their academic achievement suffers (v.)（因疾病、痛苦、悲伤等）受苦，受难，受折磨; 变差；变糟.  +

Thus, as children from a disadvantaged background develop (v.) more negative self-views, they become less able to fulfill their true potential. This represents a tremendous loss 巨大损失 — *both* for these children *and* for society at large 普遍地，全体地.


[.my1]

.at large
有“普遍地，全体地”的意思 +
- This group is not representative of the population at large. 这个团体不是全体人民的代表。

.be at large
在逃, 尚未捉拿归案 +
- Twelve prisoners are at large following a series of escapes. 一连串的越狱事件发生后，12名犯人目前依然逍遥法外。

自我观点是重要的。持有消极自我观的孩子可能会逃避挑战、在挫折面前放弃、在压力下表现不佳。因此，他们的学业成绩受到影响。因此，当来自弱势背景的孩子产生更多消极的自我观时，他们就无法发挥自己的真正潜力。这对这些儿童和整个社会来说都是巨大的损失。

Given that 考虑到，鉴于 educators are trying to help and not harm their pupils, how does this happen?  +

One reason is that in many Western countries, teachers’ thinking (n.) is often influenced by meritocracy 精英领导体制；英才管理制度, the idea that students’ achievements are reflections 映像；映照出的影像;反映；显示；表达 of their own merit 优点；美德；价值; 值得赞扬（或奖励、钦佩）的特点；功绩；长处.  +

Schools give all students the same teacher, the same desks and the same tests. The result is the illusion of a level (a.) 等高的；地位相同的；价值相等的 playing field 运动场；操场.  +

With that seemingly equal starting point, many schools implicitly 含蓄地，暗中地 encourage (v.) the notion 观念；信念；理解 that students will then succeed (v.) or fail (v.) entirely as a function of their own effort and ability — a meritocratic ideal 理想；看似完美的思想（或标准）.  +

But in truth, this approach (n.)（待人接物或思考问题的）方式，方法，态度 closes (v.) teachers’ eyes to the conditions 后定 students face (v.) outside of the classroom, such as whether they have all the materials, opportunities and support 后定 needed to learn (v.) and master (v.) the material.

.meritocracy +
/ˌmerɪˈtɑːkrəsi/ +
(a.) +
1.[ CU] a country or social system where people get power or money on the basis of their ability 精英领导体制；英才管理制度 +
2.the meritocracy [ sing.] the group of people with power in this kind of social system 精英管理班子 +
--> merit,才能，-cracy,管理，词源同democracy.引申词义精英领导体制。


鉴于教育工作者试图帮助而不是伤害学生，为什么会发生这种情况呢？原因之一是，在许多西方国家，教师的思维常常受到精英主义的影响，认为学生的成就是他们自身优点的反映。学校为所有学生提供相同的老师、相同的课桌和相同的考试。其结果是产生公平竞争环境的错觉。有了这个看似平等的起点，许多学校含蓄地鼓励这样一种观念，即学生的成功或失败, 完全取决于他们自己的努力和能力 —— 这是一种精英理想。但事实上，这种方法让教师忽视了学生在课堂外所面临的条件，例如他们是否拥有学习和掌握材料所需的所有材料、机会和支持。

educators can make a real difference in their own classrooms.  +

They can reframe (v.)再构造(图画、照片等);全新地拟定（或表达）（话语、概念或计划） students’ socioeconomic background as sources of strength rather than weakness.  +

They can convey (v.)表达，传递（思想、感情等） to students that what matters is not one’s current level of ability but how much one can improve over time 随着时间的推移.  +

And they can help students embrace (v.)拥抱;欣然接受，乐意采纳（思想、建议等）；信奉（宗教、信仰等） failure as an opportunity for learning.  +

Rather than conclude that a pupil isn’t an Einstein, teachers can help that student understand (v.) why they got a disappointing grade and how to do better next time.

.reframe
V to support or enclose (a picture, photograph, etc) in a new or different frame 再构造(图画、照片等)

教育工作者可以在自己的课堂上做出真正的改变。他们可以将学生的社会经济背景, 重新定义为优势而非劣势的来源。他们可以向学生传达这样的信息：重要的不是一个人当前的能力水平，而是一个人随着时间的推移可以提高多少。它们可以帮助学生将失败视为学习的机会。教师可以帮助学生理解为什么他们的成绩令人失望, 以及下次如何做得更好，而不是得出结论说学生不是爱因斯坦。

== Children Face Unequal Treatment in the Classroom—With Devastating Consequences

On one occasion, an 11-year-old boy named Mark received a six out of 10 on a test he had taken a week earlier. In response to his disappointment, the boy’s teacher said, “It’s okay, Mark—not everyone has to be an Einstein.” +

Why, I wondered, did the teacher conclude that Mark wasn’t an Einstein? That comment made Mark’s grade entirely a function of his innate ability. Why didn’t the teacher consider the external conditions—such as the lack of a place to study—that prevented Mark from fulfilling his potential? +

Even well-intentioned educators may unknowingly send discouraging messages to children from disadvantaged backgrounds.  +
 I have drawn on multiple studies to examine this problem and have shown how these messages can become ingrained in children’s mind. In the process, socioeconomic inequality becomes deeply etched into each child’s perceptions of themselves—with lasting and serious repercussions.


Inferring a student’s ability isn’t easy. Often teachers face ambiguity: a student may do well on some tests and poorly on others. In those cases, educators may be guided by stereotypes—generalized beliefs about a social group. A child’s gender, race and ethnicity, for example, may all influence the teacher’s evaluations. Socioeconomic status may do so as well. Years of research find a pervasive negative stereotype about the intellectual abilities of children from a poorer background: irrespective of their actual abilities, they are generally perceived as less smart than other children.


A study in the U.K. found that when teachers evaluate their students’ work, they tend to give lower grades to those from a poorer background, even when these students perform as well as their peers. And another investigation—with data from Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland—determined that teachers tend to disproportionately assign students from a disadvantaged background to lower-level, vocational tracks at the end of elementary school, even when these students have similar test scores and grades as their classmates.



We then coded the comments that teachers wrote and found that while the students from high and low socioeconomic backgrounds received roughly the same amount of praise, teachers lavished the students from a poorer background with more inflated approval such as “Amazing! You did incredibly well!” They did so because they assumed these students had to work harder to achieve their success.


Yet children readily pick up on the underlying message. In a second experiment with 63 students aged 10 to 13 years, we found that the kids were very attuned to teachers’ language. They inferred that a student who received inflated praise was more hardworking but less smart than others. Thus, even well-intentioned praise can reinforce the belief that children from a disadvantaged background are less competent than their peers.


These inadvertently denigrating messages may, over time, become ingrained in children’s mind. As I and others have found, children from a lower socioeconomic background tend to have more negative views about themselves. They see themselves as less intelligent, less able to grow their intelligence, less deserving and less worthy—even if they are as smart and high-achieving as others. Once these self-views are established, they remain relatively stable across one’s life span, which means that children can carry these negative ideas about their own ability and potential into adulthood.



Self-views are consequential. Children who hold negative self-views may avoid challenges, give up in the face of setbacks and underperform under pressure. Consequently, their academic achievement suffers. Thus, as children from a disadvantaged background develop more negative self-views, they become less able to fulfill their true potential. This represents a tremendous loss—both for these children and for society at large.



Given that educators are trying to help and not harm their pupils, how does this happen? One reason is that in many Western countries, teachers’ thinking is often influenced by meritocracy, the idea that students’ achievements are reflections of their own merit. Schools give all students the same teacher, the same desks and the same tests. The result is the illusion of a level playing field. With that seemingly equal starting point, many schools implicitly encourage the notion that students will then succeed or fail entirely as a function of their own effort and ability—a meritocratic ideal. But in truth, this approach closes teachers’ eyes to the conditions students face outside of the classroom, such as whether they have all the materials, opportunities and support needed to learn and master the material.



educators can make a real difference in their own classrooms. They can reframe students’ socioeconomic background as sources of strength rather than weakness. They can convey to students that what matters is not one’s current level of ability but how much one can improve over time. And they can help students embrace failure as an opportunity for learning. Rather than conclude that a pupil isn’t an Einstein, teachers can help that student understand why they got a disappointing grade and how to do better next time.
