.Smear fests (Google中似乎搜索不到这个词)
chat GPT 的解释: "Smear fests" refers to events or situations in journalism where there is a deliberate and concerted effort to spread false or damaging information about someone or something, usually for the purpose of discrediting them or tarnishing their reputation. It implies a sensationalized and often unethical approach to journalism, where the focus is on creating scandalous stories rather than reporting accurate and balanced information.

“Smear fests” 是一个具有贬义的表达，指的是以中伤、诽谤他人或散布负面言论为主要内容的活动或现象。这种活动通常是为了贬低或毁坏某人的声誉，尤其是在政治或媒体环境中。这里的 “fests” 是 “festivals”（节日、盛会）的缩写，用来讽刺性地强调这种中伤行为的普遍性或频繁性。 +
因此，"smear fests" 可以翻译为“中伤盛宴”或“恶意攻击潮”，指的是一种有组织或大规模的中伤、诽谤活动。

==== Difference Between Reliability and Credibility 可靠性与可信度之间的区别


Reliability vs Credibility

可靠性与可信度


Since credibility and reliability seem to have somewhat similar meanings finding the difference between reliability and credibility can be a little hard. When we speak of people, law, and even different sources of information, we use the terms reliable and credible. We wonder how reliable a source is, and how credible a story is. In this sense, these two are not identical in meaning. Credibility refers to whether something can be believed as true and accurate. Reliability, on the other hand, refers to relying on someone or something or being able to have trust and faith. It is true that the two terms are similar to a certain extent, but they are not synonymous. This article attempts to clarify the difference between the two words.

由于可信度和可靠性似乎具有相似的含义，因此找出可靠性和可信度之间的差异可能有点困难。当我们谈到人、法律甚至不同的信息来源时，我们会使用可靠和可信这两个词。我们想知道消息来源的可靠性以及故事的可信度。从这个意义上来说，两者的意义并不相同。可信度是指某件事是否可以被相信是真实和准确的。另一方面，可靠性是指依赖某人或某物或能够拥有信任和信念。确实，这两个术语在一定程度上相似，但它们不是同义词。本文试图阐明这两个词之间的区别。

What does Credibility mean?

信誉是什么意思？

When paying attention to the word credible, it can be defined as the ability to be believed in. Let us try to understand this through an example. You meet a friend at a cafeteria after a long time and she or he goes on about his new job, which seems almost too good to be true. After coming back, you might relate the incident to a family member and comment on the friend’s new job as an exaggerated version of reality or else as a made up story. In such an instance, you are questioning the credibility of the information that you just received by analyzing the facts that you have gained. So, if the information sounds out of context or false, we consider it as lacking credibility. If it is possible and we consider it to be true, we call it credible. Thus, when using the word credibility, one has to bear in mind whether the information can be believed or not.

当注意“可信”这个词时，它可以被定义为被相信的能力。让我们尝试通过一个例子来理解这一点。很久以后，你在自助餐厅遇到了一位朋友，她或他继续谈论他的新工作，这似乎好得令人难以置信。回来后，你可能会将这件事与家人联系起来，并评论朋友的新工作是现实的夸大版本，或者是编造的故事。在这种情况下，您是在通过分析您获得的事实来质疑您刚刚收到的信息的可信度。因此，如果信息听起来断章取义或虚假，我们认为它缺乏可信度。如果可能并且我们认为它是真实的，我们称之为可信的。因此，在使用可信度一词时，必须牢记信息是否可信。

What does Reliability mean?

可靠性是什么意思？

This word, Reliability, denotes dependability, trust and faith in something or someone. Unlike in the first instance of credibility, the attention paid to whether the information is believable is less. Let us try to understand this through an example as well.

可靠性这个词表示对某事或某人的可靠性、信任和信心。与最初的可信度不同，对信息是否可信的关注较少。让我们也尝试通过一个例子来理解这一点。

I rely on your good counsel.

我相信你的忠告。

When looking at this example, it highlights that the speaker depends on the advices of the person whom he or she addresses. It also highlights that the person trusts the individual who is being addressed. Even in situations where we say I rely on you, on her or him, all these denote the same fact of dependency. Let us take another example.

查看此示例时，它强调说话者依赖于他或她所针对的人的建议。它还强调了此人信任正在处理的个人。即使在我们说我依赖你、依赖她或他的情况下，所有这些都表示相同的依赖事实。让我们再举一个例子。

She is a very reliable person.

她是一个非常可靠的人。

Once again, this means that the person is very trustworthy and on whom one can depend. So , through the explanations of the two terms what is apparent is that reliability focuses more on being able to rely on, depend on or trust whereas credibility is a question of being able to believe in something.

再次，这意味着这个人非常值得信赖并且可以依赖。因此，通过对这两个术语的解释，可以明显看出，可靠性更侧重于能够依赖、依赖或信任，而可信度则是能够相信某事物的问题。

Difference Between Reliability and Credibility

What is the difference between Reliability and Credibility?

可靠性和可信度有什么区别？

• Credibility refers to whether something can be believed as true.

• 可信度是指某件事是否可以被相信是真实的。

• Reliability refers to relying on someone or something or being able to have trust and faith.

• 可靠性是指依赖某人或某事或能够拥有信任和信念。

• If a piece of information is reliable then it is also credible. However, the information’ s credibility does not always guarantee its reliability.

• 如果一条信息可靠，那么它也是可信的。然而，信息的可信度并不总是保证其可靠性。

== Schoolkids Are Falling Victim to Disinformation and Conspiracy Fantasies

...Yet some children insisted that these conspiracy fantasies were true. Both misinformation, which includes honest mistakes, and disinformation, which involves an intention to mislead, have had “a growing impact on students over the past 10 to 20 years,”

Children, it turns out, are ripe targets for fake news. Age 14 is when kids often start believing in unproven conspiratorial ideas, according to a study published in September 2021 in the British Journal of Developmental Psychology. Many teens also have trouble assessing the credibility of online information.

In a 2016 study involving nearly 8,000 U.S. students, Stanford University researchers found that more than 80 percent of middle schoolers believed that an advertisement labeled as sponsored content was actually a news story. The researchers also found that less than 20 percent of high schoolers seriously questioned spurious claims in social media.

When college students in the survey looked at a Twitter post touting a poll favoring gun control, more than two thirds failed to note that the liberal antigun groups behind the poll could have influenced the data.

Certain curricula try to train students to give more weight to journalistic sources, but some researchers argue that this practice ignores the potential biases of publications and reporters. Other courses push students to identify where information comes from and ask how the content helps those disseminating it. Overall there are very few data showing the best way to teach children how to tell fact from fiction.


Children are ripe targets for fake news. Age 14 is when kids often start believing in unproven conspiratorial ideas, according to a 2021 study.


Most media literacy approaches “begin to look thin when you ask, ‘Can you show me the evidence?’”. ... and “each group goes out of its way to diss the other.” These approaches have not been compared head-to-head, and some have only small studies supporting them. Like online media sources themselves, it is hard to know which ones to trust.

News literacy is a subset of media literacy research that deals directly with the propagation of conspiracies and the ability to distinguish real news from fake stories. It entails a set of skills that help people judge the reliability and credibility of news and information. But as with media literacy, researchers have very different ideas about how this type of news analysis should be taught.

Some programs, teach students to discern the quality of the information in part by learning how responsible journalism works. They study how journalists pursue news, how to distinguish between different kinds of information and how to judge evidence behind reported stories. The goal is to shape students into “consumers who could differentiate between raw, unmediated information coursing through the Internet and independent, verified journalism.”

Yet some media literacy scholars doubt the efficacy of these approaches. Hobbs, for instance, wrote a 2010 paper arguing that these methods glorify journalism, ignore its many problems and do little to instill critical thinking skills. “All that focus on the ideals of journalism is mere propaganda if it is blind to the realities of contemporary journalism, where partisan politics and smear fests are the surest way to build audiences,” she stated.

Other approaches teach students methods for evaluating the credibility of news and information sources, in part by determining the goals and incentives of those sources. They teach students to ask: Who created the content and why? And what do other sources say? But these methods are relatively new and have not been widely studied.

"Some approaches to media literacy not only don't work but might actually backfire by increasing students' cynicism." —Peter Adams, News Literacy Project

The lack of rigorous studies of the different approaches is indeed a major roadblock, says Paul Mihailidis, a civic media and journalism expert at Emerson College. He is the principal investigator of the Mapping Impactful Media Literacy Practices initiative, a research project supported by the National Association for Media Literacy Education. “Most of the science done is very small scale, very exploratory. It’s very qualitative,” he says. That is not simply because of a lack of resources, he adds. “There’s also a lack of clarity about what the goals are.”

Moreover, the small amount of research that does exist has largely been conducted with college students, not the middle school or high school students who are so vulnerable to disinformation. Indeed, the various approaches that are being used in K–12 classrooms have hardly been tested at all. As part of his current research initiative, Mihailidis and his team interviewed the heads of all major organizations that are part of the National Media Literacy Alliance, which works to promote media literacy education. “We are finding, repeatedly, that many of the ways in which they support schools and teachers—resources, guidelines, best practices, etcetera—are not studied in much of a rigorous fashion,” he says.


Some researchers, including Wineburg, are trying to fill in the research gaps. In a study published in 2019, Wineburg and his team compared how 10 history professors, 10 journalism fact-checkers and 25 Stanford undergraduates evaluated websites and information on social and political issues. They found that whereas historians and students were often fooled by manipulative websites, journalism fact-checkers were not. In addition, their methods of analysis differed significantly: historians and students tried to assess the validity of websites and information by reading vertically, navigating within a site to learn more about it, but fact-checkers read laterally, opening new browser tabs for different sources and running searches to judge the original website’s credibility.

Still, even if news literacy education teaches specific skills well, some researchers question its broader, longer-term impact. Once students learn how to evaluate websites and claims, how confident can we be that they will retain these skills and use them down the line? How sure can we be that these methods will inculcate students with skepticism about conspiracy theories and disinformation campaigns? And will these methods lead students to become civically engaged members of society? “There’s always this kind of leap into ‘that will make our democracy and news systems stronger.’ And I don’t know if that’s necessarily the case,” Mihailidis says.


Pressing students to be skeptical about all information also may have unexpected downsides.  Some approaches ... might actually backfire by increasing students’ cynicism or exacerbating misunderstandings about the way news media work. Students may begin to read all kinds of nefarious motives into everything. Although it is good to ask students to challenge their assumptions, the hole that opens up, that invites people to look for new explanations, that hole can be filled in deeply problematic ways. It’s very easy for students to go from healthy critical thinking to unhealthy skepticism and the idea that everyone is lying all the time.


To avoid these potential problems, Ashley advocates for broad approaches that help students develop mindsets in which they become comfortable with uncertainty. According to educational psychologist William Perry of Harvard University, students go through various stages of learning. First children are black-and-white thinkers—they think there are right answers and wrong answers. Then they develop into relativists, realizing that knowledge can be contextual. This stage can be dangerous, however. It is the one where, as Russell notes, people can come to believe there is no truth. Ashley adds that when students think everything is a lie, they also think there is no point in engaging with difficult topics.

But many more studies will be needed for researchers to reach a comprehensive understanding of what works and what doesn’t over the long term. “What we’re facing are transformational changes in the way we receive, process and share information. We’re in the middle of the most profound revolution in 500 years.”
