== Is Too Little Play Hurting (v.) Our Kids? 玩耍太少会伤害我们的孩子吗？


A long-term decline in _unsupervised  无人监督的 activity_ may *be contributing to* mental health declines in children and adolescents. +

[.my2]
"无人监督的活动"的长期减少, 可能会导致儿童和青少年的心理健康状况下降。

It’s not just _moderate evidence_. It’s _overwhelming evidence_ that if you take away 夺走 children’s opportunities for independent activity, they’re not going to learn how to be independent, and that’s going to lead them to be anxious and depressed, fearful about the future and all the things that we’re seeing now. +

[.my2]
这不仅仅是温和的证据。##压倒性的证据表明，如果剥夺孩子独立活动的机会，他们就不会学会如何独立，##这将导致他们焦虑和沮丧，对未来和我们正在经历的所有事情感到恐惧。

Play is how children pursue (v.) what’s fun for them. That’s an immediate 立即的；立刻的 source of mental health — `主` part of mental health `谓` really means “I’m happy” or “I’m most satisfied with my life right now.” +
Play and other independent activities also have far-reaching 影响深远的；广泛的 long-term effects on children’s mental health and resilience  快速恢复的能力；适应力;还原能力；弹力. +

[.my2]
#游戏是孩子们追求乐趣的方式。这是心理健康的直接来源# ——心理健康的一部分, 实际上意味着“我很高兴”或“我对现在的生活最满意”。#玩耍和其他独立活动, 也对儿童的心理健康和适应能力, 产生深远的长期影响。#

The real crisis is that young people are losing a sense of, “I can solve problems, I can deal with bumps  碰撞（声）；撞击（声） in the road of life.”  +
And `主` the way _the children learn to do these things_ `系` is *through* play(n.) 后定 where they *are responsible (a.)有责任；负责；承担义务 to* solve their own problems. They negotiate with their peers. They *figure out* how to solve quarrels 口角；争吵；拌嘴 among themselves. If somebody gets hurt, they figure out what to do about being hurt. +

[.my2]
真正的危机是年轻人正在失去##“我可以解决问题，我可以应对人生道路上的坎坷”的意识。孩子们学习做这些事情的方式是通过玩耍，他们负责解决自己的问题。他们与同行谈判。他们想出如何解决彼此之间的争吵。如果有人受伤，他们会想出如何处理受伤的情况。##

When kids are allowed to make decisions and solve problems, they exercise (v.) what’s called their _internal **locus （某事发生的）确切地点；（被视为某物的）中心，核心 of control**_. They begin to feel _they have control (v.) over experiences and their lives_, rather than _experiences controlling (v.) them_.  +

[.my2]
#当孩子们被允许做出决定和解决问题时，他们就会锻炼所谓的"内部控制点"。他们开始觉得自己可以控制经历和生活，而不是让经历控制他们。#

.locus
(n.)( formal ) ( technical 术语) the exact place where sth happens or which is thought to be the centre of sth （某事发生的）确切地点；（被视为某物的）中心，核心

.Locus of control 控制点

_Locus of control_ is the degree to which people believe that `主` #they#, *as opposed to* （表示对比）而，相对于 external forces (beyond their influence), `谓` #have control over# the outcome of events in their lives.  +
A person's "locus" (plural "loci", Latin for "place" or "location") *is conceptualized (v.)as* 构思；使形成观念；将…概念化（为…） _internal_ (a belief that one can control one's own life) or _external_ (a belief that _life is controlled by outside factors_ which the person can not influence, or that _`主` chance or fate `谓` controls their lives_).


"控制点"是人们相信"自己相对于外部力量（超出其影响力）, 能够控制生活中事件结果"的程度。 +
一个人的“轨迹”（复数“loci”，拉丁语“地方”或“位置”）被概念化为内部（相信一个人可以控制自己的生活）或外部（相信生命是由外部因素控制的，而外部因素是由外部因素控制的。人无法影响，或者说机会或命运, 控制着他们的生活） +
具有强大"内部控制源"的人, 认为生活中的事件主要是他们自己行为的结果：例如，当收到考试结果时，具有内部控制源的人, 倾向于赞扬或责备自己和自己的能力。具有较强"外部控制源"的人, 倾向于赞扬或指责外部因素，例如老师或考试难度。


_Locus of control_ is one of the four dimensions of _core self-evaluations_ 核心自我评价 – one's _fundamental appraisal_ (n.)评估，估价；评价 of oneself – *along with* 除…以外（还）；与…同样地 neuroticism 神经质，神经过敏, self-efficacy 自我效能, and self-esteem 自尊（心）. +

"控制源"是核心自我评价的四个维度之一，即一个人对自己的基本评价，其他三个维度还有神经质、自我效能, 和自尊。在一项后续研究中，Judge 等人。 (2002) 认为控制源、神经质、自我效能和自尊因素, 可能有一个共同的核心。

There’s evidence for people of all ages that `主` having a weak _internal locus control_ `系` is predictive (a.)预测的；预言的；前瞻的 of future anxiety and depression.  +
If you believe that anything can happen at any time and you can’t do anything about it, that’s a pretty anxiety-provoking (刺激的；令人生气的；激怒人的)引发焦虑的 _view of life_ 人生观. +

[.my2]
有证据表明，##对于所有年龄段的人来说，"内部控制点"较弱, 可以预测未来的焦虑和抑郁。##如果你相信任何事情随时都可能发生，而你却无能为力，这就是一种非常令人焦虑的人生观。

Control is also *central (a.)在中心的；中央的;最重要的；首要的；主要的 to* another set of established 著名的；成名的；公认的 research, called _self-determination （个人）自主权，自主能力 theory_. This research shows that children and adults have three basic psychological needs. If they’re not fulfilled (v.)实现;履行；执行；符合；具备, we’re not happy.  +

[.my2]
控制也是另一组既定研究的核心，称为##"自决理论"。这项研究表明，儿童和成人都具有三种基本的心理需求。如果他们没有得到满足，我们就会不高兴。##

.fulfil
(v.)to do or achieve what was hoped for or expected 实现 +
• to fulfil your dream/ambition/potential 实现梦想╱抱负；发挥潜力

.Self-determination theory
自我决定论（英语：Self-determination theory，简称SDT）是一个有关于人类个性与动机的理论，考量到个人与生俱来的天赋资质与心理需求。 +
在1970年代，自我决定论的研究着重在探讨"内在动机"与"外在动机"，并尝试了解"内在动机"影响人类行为的途径。

"内在动机"意指: 促使一个人行为的理由, 是因为这样的行为本身, 能带来娱乐与满足感. 相对来说, "外在动机"代表有外在的诱因促使个人做出该行为. +
"内化"则是指: 使"外在动机"转变成"内在动机"的一个动机转换历程。


#自我决定论提出了三个与生俱来的需求，如果能满足该需求，则将会为个人带来最佳的发展与进步:# +
1. #Competence# 胜任 +
2. #Relatedness# 归属 +
3. #Autonomy# 自主 +
这些需求被视为是天生的.

自我决定论, 对于动机的阐述，分成了内在动机与外在动机:

[.my3]

|Header 1 |Header 2

|内在动机
|可以分成下列三项： +
- 去了解 (To Know) +
- 去达成 (To Accomplish) +
- 获得刺激 (To Stimulate) +

|外在动机
|外在动机相对于内在动机则是与赏酬概念有关系，对于做这件事所获得的内在与外在赏酬来决定是否做这件事。 外在动机可以分成下列四项:  +
- 外在赏酬：做这件事会获得"外在奖励或酬劳" +
- 内在赏酬：做这件事, "会被夸奖"或"避免被责骂排挤" +
- 自我认同赏酬：认为做这件事"能对自己有帮助"，尽管不一定有内在动机 +
- 整合赏酬：统整以上三者之后，认为整体来说做这件事对自己有帮助，此行为的动机型态亦较趋近"内在动机"

The first of those needs is autonomy 自主；自主权. The sense that we have some freedom to choose what we’re going to do, that we’re in charge of our own life. +

chatGpt : 在这个句子中，"declines" 是名词，表示精神健康的下降或减少。使用"复数形式"的原因, 可能是因为作者想要强调"一系列的下降趋势"或"涉及不同方面的下降"。复数形式有时可以用来表示一系列相关的事件或情况，而不仅仅是单一的下降。在这里，它可能指的是"多个方面或类型的精神健康"下降趋势。

[.my2]
随着带有前置摄像头的智能手机的推出，社交媒体也在这个时候变得更加视觉化。青少年在一起的时间越来越少，睡觉的时间也越来越少。

So if you put these three things together — more time online, less time with friends face-to-face, less time sleeping — that’s a very bad recipe 方法；秘诀；诀窍;烹饪法；食谱 for mental health.  +

[.my2]
所以如果你把这三件事放在一起——#更多的上网时间、更少的与朋友面对面的时间、更少的睡眠时间——这对心理健康来说是非常糟糕的。#

[.my2]
从数据来看，特温格看到的不仅仅是一个时间顺序序列，而是青少年在屏幕上的日常生活方式, 发生了巨大而根本的变化，

Economics are actually improving over that time. The unemployment rate was going down, the U.S. economy was finally starting to improve after the Great Recession.  +

[.my2]
那段时间经济实际上正在改善。失业率正在下降，美国经济在大衰退后终于开始好转。 +
(也就是说, 经济是好转的, 但青少年的精神问题却上升了, 这只能说明青少年的精神问题, 并非是经济萧条引起的, 而是其他原因引起的, 考虑到精神问题和手机社交网络是同时兴起的, 所以只能是手机社交平台的原因.)

We also know from several recent studies that `主` these increases in anxiety and loneliness among teens `系` are worldwide. That helps us *rule (v.) out*  把…排除在外；认为…不适合 a lot of U.S.-based explanations 解释；说明；阐述 around _politics_ or _school shootings_ or _any of these other things_ because we see very, very similar patterns in other countries around the world.  +

我们还从最近的几项研究中得知，青少年焦虑和孤独感的增加是全球性的。这有助于我们排除许多基于美国的关于政治或校园枪击事件或其他任何事情的解释，因为我们在世界其他国家看到了非常非常相似的模式。

== (pure) Is Too Little Play Hurting Our Kids?


A long-term decline in unsupervised activity may be contributing to mental health declines in children and adolescents. +


It’s not just moderate evidence. It’s overwhelming evidence that if you take away children’s opportunities for independent activity, they’re not going to learn how to be independent, and that’s going to lead them to be anxious and depressed, fearful about the future and all the things that we’re seeing now. +


Play is how children pursue what’s fun for them. That’s an immediate source of mental health—part of mental health really means “I’m happy” or “I’m most satisfied with my life right now.” +
Play and other independent activities also have far-reaching long-term effects on children’s mental health and resilience. +


The real crisis is that young people are losing a sense of, “I can solve problems, I can deal with bumps in the road of life.” And the way the children learn to do these things is through play where they are responsible to solve their own problems. They negotiate with their peers. They figure out how to solve quarrels among themselves. If somebody gets hurt, they figure out what to do about being hurt. +


When kids are allowed to make decisions and solve problems, they exercise what’s called their internal locus of control. They begin to feel they have control over experiences and their lives, rather than experiences controlling them.  +

There’s evidence for people of all ages that having a weak internal locus control is predictive of future anxiety and depression. If you believe that anything can happen at any time and you can’t do anything about it, that’s a pretty anxiety-provoking view of life. +


Control is also central to another set of established research, called self-determination theory. This research shows that children and adults have three basic psychological needs. If they’re not fulfilled, we’re not happy.  +


The first of those needs is autonomy. The sense that we have some freedom to choose what we’re going to do, that we’re in charge of our own life. +

The second of these needs is competence. Not only am I free to choose what I want to do, but I can do it. +


And the third is relatedness. It’s also important that I have other people on my side on this. Connection with peers by this theory  is an extremely important contributor to the sense of well-being. +


These ideas are borne out in indigenous cultures. These anthropological findings suggest that from an evolutionary perspective, independent activity, personal responsibility, and self-initiated exploration and learning ideally begin at an early age. +


...

We need to be cautious about drawing a causal connection between those trends. And it’s particularly, in my view, unclear how far we can kind of correlate broad social trends in aspects such as independent play and mental health.  +

Collishaw sees many changes over time that could be involved—school pressures, highly structured schedules, the mental health of parents and the rise of digital technology.  +


It’s hard to disentangle those and make a strong case that one has a causal effect on the other. +


Twenge sees another story in the data—a leveling off in mental health declines starting in the 1990s, and a huge increase 15 years later. And that rise coincided with—the smartphone.  +


Social media also became more visual around this time, Twenge says, as smartphones with front-facing cameras were introduced. Teens spent less time together and less time sleeping.  +


So if you put these three things together—more time online, less time with friends face-to-face, less time sleeping—that’s a very bad recipe for mental health.  +


Looking at the data, Twenge saw more than a time sequence lining up, but a huge and fundamental change to how teens spent their day-to-day lives—on-screen.  +

Economics are actually improving over that time. The unemployment rate was going down, the U.S. economy was finally starting to improve after the Great Recession.  +


We also know from several recent studies that these increases in anxiety and loneliness among teens are worldwide. That helps us rule out a lot of U.S.-based explanations around politics or school shootings or any of these other things because we see very, very similar patterns in other countries around the world.  +

In one of the best data sets that we’ve got, the correlation between hours of social media use a day and symptoms of depression among teen girls is 0.2. The correlation between childhood lead exposure and adult IQ is 0.11—about half the size. So again, I think that really makes that case that there are not small effects. +


Raise the age to have a social media account to 16 and actually enforce age. That’s one of the clearest, most straightforward things that we can do. And it could potentially have a big impact. +

We enforce age limits for driving. We enforce age limits for voting. We enforce age limits for alcohol. Why not do it for social media? +


That meta-analysis about secure attachment showed that the greatest decline and the reason for the rise in insecurity is negative views of other people. The loss of trust and the inability to count on or depend on others to give you warm, trusting connection—and I think that’s happening not because parents don’t care, it’s that they don’t have enough time and encouragement and support and spending that kind of quality time to make those connections. +

We’re increasingly believing that young people are incompetent and can’t be trusted to do things responsibly, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because we don’t allow them those opportunities, they don’t develop those opportunities. +
