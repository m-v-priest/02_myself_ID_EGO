== Short Naps Have Major Benefits for Your Mind 短暂的小睡对你的大脑有很大的好处

A light *midday snooze* boosts (v.) memory and other types of cognition — and your mood +
中午小憩, 可以增强记忆力和其他类型的认知能力，以及你的心情

Other countries have strong *napping traditions*, but here in the U.S. it is often equated (v.)同等看待；使等同 with laziness. +
其他国家都有很强的午睡传统，但在美国，这常常被等同于懒惰。

More recent research, though, has clarified 使更清晰易懂；阐明；澄清 that different types of naps have different effects. A number of scientists now think *the sweet spot* is about 20 to 30 minutes. +
最近的研究表明，不同类型的小睡有不同的效果。许多科学家现在认为最佳时间是 20 到 30 分钟。


The urge 强烈的欲望；冲动 to nap is governed by two physiological 生理的，生理机能的 processes.  +
One is called *homeostatic 自我平衡的；内环境稳衡的 sleep pressure* (HSP), and it builds (v.)逐渐增强 条件状 *the longer* you are awake.  +
The other involves daily *circadian 昼夜节律的，生理节奏的 rhythms*, which leave everyone a little sleepy (a.) 困倦的；瞌睡的 in the afternoon.  +
Some people, like me, are *habitual 习惯性的；积习很深的 nappers* even when we get adequate sleep at night.  +
*Others can't nap* unless they are severely sleep-deprived. Genes 基因, such as those *that underlie (v.)构成…的基础；作为…的原因 HSP*, drive (v.) much of the difference.

想要小睡的冲动, 是由两个生理过程控制的。其中一种称为"稳态睡眠压力"（HSP），您清醒的时间越长，它就会增加。另一个涉及"日常昼夜节律"，这让每个人在下午都有点困。有些人，比如我，即使晚上睡眠充足，也会习惯性小睡。其他人无法小睡，除非他们严重睡眠不足。基因，例如 HSP 背后的基因，在很大程度上导致了差异。

Short naps *do indeed* have cognitive benefits, says Michael Chee of *the Center for Sleep and Cognition* at the National University of Singapore. In a 2022 analysis, his team found *especially significant improvements* in certain kinds of memory, information-processing speed and vigilance (n.)警戒，警觉 (the ability to respond to an unexpected event, say, a swerving 使突然转向; 突然转向 car).

新加坡国立大学睡眠与认知中心的 Michael Chee 表示，短暂的小睡确实对认知有好处。在 2022 年的分析中，他的团队发现某些记忆、信息处理速度, 和警惕性（对意外事件做出反应的能力，例如突然转向的汽车）有特别显着的改善。

Even a short, 10-minute nap will refresh  使恢复精力；使凉爽; 重新斟满 you. +
即使是 10 分钟的小睡也会让你精神焕发.

Leong advises people *who work (v.) typical day hours* to avoid *napping much* after 5 P.M. so they don't *throw off* 摆脱；甩掉 their nighttime sleep. +
Leong 建议白天工作的人避免在下午 5 点后小憩。这样他们就不会失去夜间睡眠。

Cognitive benefits do *show up* 使显露; 显露 after naps *that extend past 30 minutes*, and those benefits *last (v.) longer*.  +
But longer naps let a person *move into deeper sleep* and *increase “sleep inertia (n.)缺乏活力；惰性；保守,”* that *groggy (a.)（因疾病或疲劳而）昏昏沉沉，眩晕无力，踉踉跄跄 feeling* on waking. Even though the grogginess 酒醉；东歪西倒 can pass (v.) relatively quickly and not everyone gets it, many people find it unpleasant.

午睡时间超过 30 分钟后，认知益处确实会显现出来，而且这些益处会持续更长时间。但较长的小睡时间会使人进入更深的睡眠状态，并增加“睡眠惯性”，即醒来时的昏昏沉沉的感觉。尽管这种昏昏沉沉的感觉会相对较快地消失，而且并不是每个人都会出现这种情况，但许多人还是觉得不舒服。

Longer naps *are also associated with* some health problems.  +
In a 2023 study of more than 3,000 otherwise healthy Europeans *with an average age of* 41, Garaulet and her colleagues found that `主` those who napped for more than 30 minutes at a time `系` were 23 percent *more* likely to be obese (a.) 臃肿的；虚胖的；病态肥胖的 *than* those who didn't nap at all. (Obesity *was calculated with* the body mass index and several other indicators.)  +
They were also more likely to *have a combination of* high blood pressure, high cholesterol 胆固醇, and other health issues.  +
In addition, long naps reduce (v.) the body's ability *to lose fat* on a diet, Garaulet has shown.

较长的小睡时间也与一些健康问题有关。在 2023 年对 3000 多名平均年龄 41 岁的健康欧洲人进行的一项研究中，Garaulet 和她的同事发现，那些一次小睡超过 30 分钟的人, 比那些不小睡的人, 肥胖的可能性高出 23%根本不。 （肥胖是根据体重指数和其他几个指标来计算的。）他们也更有可能同时患有高血压、高胆固醇, 和其他健康问题。此外，加劳莱特还表明，长时间的小睡, 会降低身体通过节食减肥的能力。

But *it is probably a disease* that causes the extra napping *and not the other way around* (转弯；掉转；掉头)而不是相反的. That's *what happens with Alzheimer's*, for instance.  +
Even in younger adults, researchers have found a link *between* increased brain inflammation 发炎；炎症 *and* more napping.  +
If someone begins to need frequent naps (more than once a day) and to regularly sleep for more than an hour, that could be a sign of illness, Chee says.

但这可能是一种疾病导致了额外的小睡，而不是相反。例如，阿尔茨海默氏症就是这种情况。即使在年轻人中，研究人员也发现, 大脑炎症增加与午睡时间增加之间, 存在联系。奇说，如果有人开始需要频繁小睡（每天超过一次）, 并且经常睡眠超过一个小时，这可能是疾病的征兆。

== Short Naps Have Major Benefits for Your Mind

A light midday snooze boosts memory and other types of cognition — and your mood +


Other countries have strong napping traditions, but here in the U.S. it is often equated with laziness. +


More recent research, though, has clarified that different types of naps have different effects. A number of scientists now think the sweet spot is about 20 to 30 minutes. +


The urge to nap is governed by two physiological processes. One is called homeostatic sleep pressure (HSP), and it builds the longer you are awake. The other involves daily circadian rhythms, which leave everyone a little sleepy in the afternoon. Some people, like me, are habitual nappers even when we get adequate sleep at night. Others can't nap unless they are severely sleep-deprived. Genes, such as those that underlie HSP, drive much of the difference.




Short naps do indeed have cognitive benefits, says Michael Chee of the Center for Sleep and Cognition at the National University of Singapore. In a 2022 analysis, his team found especially significant improvements in certain kinds of memory, information-processing speed and vigilance (the ability to respond to an unexpected event, say, a swerving car).


Even a short, 10-minute nap will refresh you. +

Leong advises people who work typical day hours to avoid napping much after 5 P.M. so they don't throw off their nighttime sleep. +


Cognitive benefits do show up after naps that extend past 30 minutes, and those benefits last longer. But longer naps let a person move into deeper sleep and increase “sleep inertia,” that groggy feeling on waking. Even though the grogginess can pass relatively quickly and not everyone gets it, many people find it unpleasant.


Longer naps are also associated with some health problems. In a 2023 study of more than 3,000 otherwise healthy Europeans with an average age of 41, Garaulet and her colleagues found that those who napped for more than 30 minutes at a time were 23 percent more likely to be obese than those who didn't nap at all. (Obesity was calculated with the body mass index and several other indicators.) They were also more likely to have a combination of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and other health issues. In addition, long naps reduce the body's ability to lose fat on a diet, Garaulet has shown.


But it is probably a disease that causes the extra napping and not the other way around. That's what happens with Alzheimer's, for instance. Even in younger adults, researchers have found a link between increased brain inflammation and more napping. If someone begins to need frequent naps (more than once a day) and to regularly sleep for more than an hour, that could be a sign of illness, Chee says.
