Let’s say /you have a Spanish-English bilingual 会说两种语言的 person /talking to another Spanish-English bilingual person.  ... they can use whatever words /work (v.) in whatever ways they want /to put those words together /to convey (v.)表达，传递（思想、感情等） thoughts and ideas that they have, right?

假设您有一个西班牙语-英语双语者与另一个西班牙语-英语双语者交谈。他们可以使用任何有用的词，以他们想要的任何方式, 将这些词组合在一起，以传达他们的想法和想法，对吗？

What’s actually hard is /when you’re in a situation /where you have to *stick with* just one language. Let’s say, as a Spanish-English bilingual person, you’re *in conversation with* someone /who only speaks English or Spanish. In one hypothesis 假说，假设, the adaptive 适应的；有适应能力的 control hypothesis, the bilingual individual /has to work really, really hard /to make this conscious 有知觉的；有意识的 effort /to suppress a language /*to communicate effectively with* one monolingual person /versus （比较两种不同想法、选择等）与…相对，与…相比 another fellow 男人；男孩；家伙；哥儿们 bilingual person.

真正困难的是，当你处于只能坚持使用一种语言的情况下。比方说，作为一名西班牙语-英语双语者，您正在与只会说英语或西班牙语的人交谈。在一个假设中，即适应性控制假设，双语者必须非常非常努力地做出这种有意识的努力来抑制一种语言，以便与一个单语者和另一个双语者进行有效交流。

Current ideas about the bilingual brain /suggest that /both languages are always accessible, even when the bilingual person is speaking with a monolingual person. So in specific social contexts, bilingual people have to further develop their working memory and attention skills /to prevent switching to the language /that the monolingual speaker would not understand. In other words, the brain activity looks a lot like what occurs in people /who speak just one language.

目前关于双语大脑的观点表明，即使双语者与单语者交谈，两种语言始终是可以访问的。因此，在特定的社会背景下，双语者必须进一步发展他们的工作记忆和注意力技能，以防止切换到单语者无法理解的语言。换句话说，大脑活动看起来很像只说一种语言的人的大脑活动。

Let’s say you have a Spanish-English bilingual person talking to another Spanish-English bilingual person.  ... they can use whatever words work in whatever ways they want to put those words together to convey thoughts and ideas that they have, right?


What’s actually hard is when you’re in a situation where you have to stick with just one language. Let’s say, as a Spanish-English bilingual person, you’re in conversation with someone who only speaks English or Spanish. In one hypothesis, the adaptive control hypothesis, the bilingual individual has to work really, really hard to make this conscious effort to suppress a language to communicate effectively with one monolingual person versus another fellow bilingual person.


Current ideas about the bilingual brain suggest that both languages are always accessible, even when the bilingual person is speaking with a monolingual person. So in specific social contexts, bilingual people have to further develop their working memory and attention skills to prevent switching to the language that the monolingual speaker would not understand. In other words, the brain activity looks a lot like what occurs in people who speak just one language.
