== Hunger in Gaza Could Affect Survivors’ Health for Decades 加沙的饥饿可能会影响幸存者的健康数十年

While famine causes severe effects immediately, it can also affect people’s health years down the road—and possibly even the health of their children and grandchildren.

[.my2]
虽然饥荒会立即造成严重影响，但它也会影响人们未来几年的健康，甚至可能影响他们子孙的健康。


What’s the difference between starvation and malnutrition?  Starvation is literally not getting enough food. Malnutrition is not getting an adequate amount of specific nutrients. So malnutrition can include starvation, but it can also include having an imbalance of different food groups.

[.my2]
"饥饿"和"营养不良"有什么区别？饥饿实际上就是得不到足够的食物。营养不良是指没有获得足够量的特定营养素。因此，"营养不良"可能包括饥饿，但也可能包括不同食物类别的不平衡。

What’s the difference between stunting and wasting?

[.my2]
发育迟缓和消瘦有什么区别？

Wasting is basically an acute form malnutrition when your muscle and fat waste away. Stunting is a more permanent, chronic form of malnutrition.

[.my2]
"消瘦"基本上是一种"急性营养不良"，当你的肌肉和脂肪消失时。"发育迟缓"是一种更持久、"慢性的营养不良形式"。

generally stunting is not reversible.

[.my2]
一般来说, 发育迟缓是"不可逆"的。


even after children return to normal nutrition, they continue to show health issues months or years later—such as heart disease, high blood pressure and metabolic disease.

[.my2]
即使儿童恢复正常营养，他们在几个月或几年后仍然会出现健康问题，例如心脏病、高血压和代谢疾病。


And even people who are exposed to famine before birth can be affected. the Dutch Hunger Winter was a famine in the Netherlands from 1944 to 1945, during German occupation in World War II. There was a major study in 1976 of 300,000 men who were born during that time. The study found that individuals who were exposed to hunger while in utero during the first half of pregnancy were more likely to be obese as adults than those who weren’t exposed to hunger or those who were exposed later in pregnancy.

[.my2]
*甚至那些在出生前经历过饥荒的人, 也会受到影响.* 荷兰饥饿冬季是指 1944 年至 1945 年二战德国占领期间荷兰发生的饥荒。 1976 年有一项针对 300,000 名当时出生的男性的大型研究。研究发现，*在怀孕前半段在子宫内经历过饥饿的人, 比那些没有经历过饥饿, 或在怀孕后期经历过饥饿的人, 成年后更容易肥胖。*

Other studies have found that men who were in the womb during that famine were also more likely to develop heart disease and not live as long as those born soon afterward.

[.my2]
其他研究发现，**在那场饥荒期间还在子宫里的男性, 也更容易患心脏病，**而且寿命也不像那些饥荒之后出生的人那么长。

So, what do scientists think could be responsible for these long-lasting effects?

[.my2]
那么，科学家认为, 是什么造成了这些长期影响呢？


Epigenetics. It’s basically the set of processes that turn parts of the genome on or off. The way this normally happens is through something called DNA methylation.

[.my2]
*表观遗传学。它基本上是一组打开或关闭部分基因组的过程。这种情况通常发生的方式, 是通过 DNA 甲基化。*


[.my1]
.案例
====
.表观遗传学
其研究范畴为：在“非DNA序列变化”情况下，遗传信息通过某些机制或途径传递给子代。*表观遗传学研究的是：基因组相关功能改变而不涉及"核苷酸序列变化"。例如"DNA甲基化"和"组蛋白修饰"，两者均能在不改变DNA序列的前提下, 调节基因的表达.*  +

表观遗传现象的机制或途径，包括: DNA甲基化、RNA甲基化、RNA干扰、核小体定位、染色质构象改变、染色质重塑、组蛋白修饰，长非编码RNA序列等。

Studies of the Dutch Hunger Winter show that people who were exposed to famine during gestation had differences in DNA methylation 60 years later, compared with siblings who were born later on.

[.my2]
对荷兰饥饿冬天的研究表明，*在怀孕期间经历过饥荒的人, 与后来出生的兄弟姐妹相比，60 年后的 DNA 甲基化存在差异。*

And some research suggests being exposed to famine might affect people’s children, too. Studies of the Great Chinese Famine, which occurred from 1959 to 1961 under Mao Zedong’s Communist regime and killed tens of millions of people, found that children of people exposed to the famine were more likely to have high blood sugar, obesity and cognitive difficulties.

[.my2]
一些研究表明，遭受饥荒也可能会影响人们的孩子。对1959年至1961年毛泽东共产党政权统治下的**中国大饥荒的研究发现，遭受饥荒的人们的孩子, 更有可能出现高血糖、肥胖和认知障碍。**

Some research has actually hinted that the effects of being exposed to hunger could actually affect the third generation—a so-called “grandchild effect.” But this is where it gets a little hairy. Because epigenetic marks get wiped out every generation, it’s not totally clear how the changes would be passed down.  There’s still some contention about whether epigenetic markers are being fully wiped out—not to get all in the weeds.

[.my2]
*一些研究实际上暗示，饥饿的影响实际上可能会影响到第三代，即所谓的“孙辈效应”。但这就是有点棘手的地方。由于"表观遗传标记"每一代都会被消除，因此尚不完全清楚这些变化将如何传递下去。* 关于表观遗传标记是否被完全消灭（而不是全部被消灭）仍然存在一些争议。


as of right now, researchers are saying it’s going to be difficult to track the full intergenerational effects of famine. With famine, you get social breakdowns. So it gets incredibly difficult to maintain the records to identify who was exposed.

[.my2]
截至目前，要追踪饥荒的完整代际影响, 将很困难. (因为)饥荒会导致社会崩溃。因此，维护记录来识别谁被暴露是非常困难的。
