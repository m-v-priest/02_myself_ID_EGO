== Introduction 介绍

Written in 1787, ratified 批准 (条约或书面协议) in 1788, and in operation since 1789, the United States Constitution is the world’s longest surviving written charter 宪章，章程 of government. Its first three words – “We The People” – affirm 肯定属实；申明；断言 that the government of the United States exists to serve its citizens. `主` The supremacy  至高无上；最大权力；最高权威；最高地位 of the people through 通过（障碍、阶段或测试）；穿过 their elected representatives `谓` is recognized in Article I, which creates a Congress 国会，议会 *consisting of* a *Senate* and *a House of Representatives*. `主` *The positioning of Congress* at the beginning of the Constitution `谓` *affirms* its status *as* the “First Branch” of the federal government.

美国宪法制定于1787年，1788年批准，自1789年开始实施，是世界上现存时间最长的成文政府宪章。它的前三个词——“我们人民”——肯定了美国政府的存在是为了服务其公民。人民通过他们选出的代表行使最高权力的原则, 在第一条中得到承认，该条规定了由参议院和众议院组成的国会。将国会置于宪法开篇的位置, 确认了其作为联邦政府的“第一分支”的地位。

The Constitution *assigned 分配（某物）；分派，布置（工作、任务等） to* Congress responsibility for organizing the executive and judicial branches, raising revenue  财政收入；税收收入；收益, declaring war, and *making all laws* necessary for executing these powers. The president is permitted *to veto specific legislative 立法的；制定法律的 acts*, but Congress has the authority *to override presidential vetoes* by two-thirds majorities of both houses. *The Constitution also provides that* the Senate advise (v.)  and consent (v.) 同意；准许；允许 *on* key executive and judicial appointments and *on* the approval for *ratification 批准，认可 of treaties* 条约；协定问题.

宪法赋予国会组织行政和司法部门、筹集收入、宣战, 以及制定执行这些权力所需的所有法律的责任。总统可以否决具体的立法法案，但国会有权以参众两院三分之二的多数, 推翻总统的否决权。《宪法》还规定，参议院就关键的行政和司法任命以及批准条约, 提供咨询和同意。

For over two centuries the Constitution *has remained in force* because its framers successfully separated and balanced governmental powers to safeguard the interests of *majority rule* 多数原则 and *minority rights* 少数人权利, of liberty and equality, and of the federal and state governments. *More* a concise 简明的；简练的；简洁的 statement of national principles *than* a detailed plan of governmental operation, the Constitution has evolved to meet *the changing needs* of a modern society 后定 *profoundly  极大地；深刻地; 严重地；完全地；彻底地 different from* the eighteenth-century world 后定 *in which* its creators 创造者 lived. *To date* 迄今，到现在为止, the Constitution has been amended 修正，修订（法律文件、声明等） 27 times, most recently in 1992. The first ten amendments constitute (v.)  *the Bill of Rights*.

两个多世纪以来，《宪法》一直有效，因为宪法的制定者成功地分离和平衡了政府权力，以维护多数人统治和少数人权利、自由和平等, 以及联邦和州政府的利益。《宪法》与其说是政府运作的详细计划，不如说是对国家原则的简明扼要的陈述，它的发展, 是为了满足现代社会不断变化的需要，而现代社会, 与《宪法》的制定者所生活的18世纪世界, 截然不同。迄今为止，《宪法》已经修改了27次，最近一次是在1992年。前十项修正案, 构成了《权利法案》。
