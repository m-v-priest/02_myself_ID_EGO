放射性核素，也叫不稳定核素，是相对于稳定核素来说的。*它是指不稳定的原子核*，能自发地放出射线（如α射线、β射线等），通过衰变形成稳定的核素。衰变时放出的能量称为"衰变能"，衰变到原始数目一半所需要的时间成为"衰变半衰期"，其范围很广，分布在latexmath:[ 10^{15}] 年到 latexmath:[ 10^{-12}] 秒之间。

一场毁灭性的地震和随后的海啸使沿海发电厂瘫痪，导致反应堆堆芯过热，该电站发生爆炸。此后，超过 130 万立方米的海水被喷洒到受损的堆芯上，以防止它们过热，从而使海水受到 64 种放射性元素（称为放射性核素）的污染。最令人担忧的是那些可能对人类健康构成威胁的元素：碳14、碘131、铯137、锶90、钴60和氢3（也称为氚）。

== Is Fukushima Wastewater Release Safe? What the Science Says

The power station exploded after a devastating earthquake and subsequent tsunami crippled the coastal plant, overheating the reactor cores. Since then, more than 1.3 million cubic metres of seawater have been sprayed onto the damaged cores to keep them from overheating, contaminating the water with 64 radioactive elements, known as radionuclides. Of greatest concern are those that could pose a threat to human health: carbon-14, iodine-131, caesium-137, strontium-90, cobalt-60 and hydrogen-3, also known as tritium.


Some of these radionuclides have a relatively short half-life and would already have decayed in the 12 years since the disaster. But others take longer to decay; carbon-14, for example, has a half-life of more than 5,000 years.


The contaminated water has been collected, treated to reduce the radioactive content. The ALPS process removes enough of 62 of the 64 radionuclides to bring their concentration below Japan’s 2022 regulatory limits for water to be discharged into the environment. These limits are based on recommendations from the International Commission on Radiological Protection. But that process does not remove carbon-14 and tritium.

... He argues that a greater risk is posed by keeping the treated water on-site. “The risk of another earthquake or a typhoon causing a leak of a tank is higher, and they’re running out of space.”

the US National Association of Marine Laboratories in Herndon, Virginia, also voiced its opposition to the planned release, saying that there was “a lack of adequate and accurate scientific data supporting Japan’s assertion of safety”.

Tritium is a β-radiation emitter — albeit a weak one — meaning that it emits ionizing radiation that can damage DNA.


TEPCO says fishing is not routinely conducted in an area within 3 kilometres of where the pipeline will discharge the water. But Richmond is concerned the tritium could concentrate in the food web as larger organisms eat smaller contaminated ones. “The concept of dilution as the solution to pollution has demonstrably been shown to be false,” Richmond says. “The very chemistry of dilution is undercut by the biology of the ocean.” ... the organically bound form of tritium could accumulate in fish and marine organisms.

A spokesperson for TEPCO said that the company has been conducting tests in which marine organisms are raised in seawater containing ALPS-treated water.
