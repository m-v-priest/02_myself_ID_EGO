== (解说) 北美殖民地人民, 自治民主议会的建立

Although many differences separated (v.) Spain and France from England, perhaps #the factor# that contributed most to distinct (a.)截然不同的；有区别的 paths of colonization /#was# the form of their government.

[.my2]
尽管西班牙和法国, 与英国之间存在许多差异，但对不同殖民化道路贡献最大的因素, 也许是它们的政府形式。



Spain and France had _absolute monarchies_ 君主制, but Britain had a limited monarchy 君主政体，君主制. In New France and New Spain, all authority 权力 flowed (v.) from the Crown to the settlers, with no input from below.

[.my2]
西班牙和法国实行"绝对君主制"，但英国实行"有限君主制"。在新法兰西和新西班牙，所有权力都从王室流向定居者，没有来自下层的干预。

An absolute monarchy is a state in which the monarch has sovereign (a.)掌握全部权力的；有至高无上的权力的 power /and controls (v.) all aspects of government without being checked by any representative assemblies 立法机构；会议；议会. +
A limited or constitutional monarchy is a state /in which the power of the monarch is checked by other _constitutionally 宪法地 sanctioned 批准; 认可 institutions_ 机构, such as a REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY 代表大会 (e.g., the British Parliament).

[.my2]
"绝对君主制", 是君主拥有主权, 并控制政府各个方面, 而不受任何"代表议会"制衡的国家。 +
有限君主制, 或君主立宪制, 是君主的权力受到其他"宪法认可"的机构（例如"代表大会"（例如"英国议会"））检查的国家。

`主` The English kings who ruled the 13 original colonies `谓` reserved the right to decide the fate of their colonies *as well*, but not alone. +
The colonists drew upon 凭借；利用；动用 their claims to _traditional English rights_ /and *insisted on* raising (v.)筹募；征集；召集；组建 their own representative assemblies.

[.my1]
.案例
====
.draw on/upon sth
to use a supply of sth that is available to you凭借；利用；动用
====

Such was the case with the VIRGINIA _HOUSE OF BURGESSES_  ((英格兰)自由民)下议院, the first *popularly (ad.)（一国）民众作出的 elected* legislative body 立法机构 in the New World.

[.my2]
统治最初 13 个殖民地的英国国王, 也保留决定其殖民地命运的权利，但不是单独决定。殖民者利用他们对英国传统权利的主张，坚持建立自己的代表大会。弗吉尼亚议院就是这种情况，它是新世界第一个"民选立法机构"。

English landowners had insisted on meeting with their leaders for consultation (n.)咨询；商讨；磋商 in local matters *ever since* the MAGNA CARTA 大宪章 was signed in 1215. Virginia settlers expected that same right.

[.my2]
自 1215 年《大宪章》签署以来，英国土地所有者, 就一直坚持与他们的领导人会面，协商当地事务。弗吉尼亚定居者也希望拥有同样的权利。

Modeled (v.) after 模仿；仿照 the English Parliament, the General Assembly was established in 1619. +
In 1643 it became a bicameral 两院制的 body, establishing the House of Burgesses as one of its two chambers （议会的）议院. +
Members would *meet* (v.) at least once a year *with* their royal governor 统治者；管辖者；总督 to decide local laws /and determine (v.)决定；形成;确定；裁决；安排 local taxation.

[.my2]
仿效英国议会，大会于 1619 年成立。1643 年，它成为两院制机构，并设立了下议院作为其两院之一。成员每年至少与皇家总督会面一次，以决定当地法律, 并确定地方税收。


The FOUNDERS of the New England colonies had an entirely different mission from the Jamestown settlers. +
Although economic prosperity 经济繁荣 was still a goal of the New England settlers, their true goal was spiritual. +

*Fed up 厌烦；厌倦；不愉快 with* the ceremonial 礼仪的；礼节的；用于礼仪的 Church of England, Pilgrims 清教徒前辈移民 and Puritans 清教徒 sought to recreate (v.) society in the manner they believed God truly intended (v.) it to be designed.

[.my2]
新英格兰殖民地的创始人, 肩负着与"詹姆斯敦定居者"完全不同的使命。尽管经济繁荣, 仍然是新英格兰定居者的目标，但他们真正的目标, 却是精神上的。厌倦了英国教会的仪式，朝圣者和清教徒, 试图以"他们相信上帝真正想要设计的方式"来重建社会。

Where else *but* in the New World /could such a golden opportunity be found? The land was unspoiled (a.)有自然美的；未遭破坏的. Children could be raised without the corruption of old English religious ideas. +
`主` The chance to create a perfect society `系`  was there for the taking 可获得的, 可供自由拿取. The Stuart kings saw America a means to get rid of troublemakers. Everything was falling into place 变得清楚；明朗化; 有条不紊地进行，按部就班.

[.my2]
除了新世界之外，还能在哪里找到这样的黄金机会呢？这片土地没有受到任何破坏。孩子们可以在不受古老英国宗教观念污染的情况下成长。创建一个完美社会的机会就在眼前。斯图亚特国王将美国视为摆脱麻烦制造者的手段。一切都步入正轨。

By 1620, #the seeds# for a new society, quite different from the one 后定 already established at Jamestown, #were planted deeply# within the souls of a few brave pioneers. `主` Their quest `谓` would form (v.) the basis of New England society.

[.my2]
到 1620 年，一个与詹姆斯敦已经建立的社会截然不同的新社会的种子, 已深深植根于一些勇敢的先驱者的灵魂中。他们的追求, 将构成新英格兰社会的基础。


Not all the English Separatists 分离主义者；独立主义者 set out for 出发前往 the New World. +
The first group to leave England actually headed for the Dutch Netherlands in 1608. +

They became uneasy (a.)担心的；忧虑的；不安的 in their new land /as their children started speaking Dutch and abandoning English traditions. +
Even worse to the Separatists, `主` #the tolerance# 后定 shown to them by the Dutch `谓` #was shown to# many different faiths. +

They became disgusted (a.)厌恶的；憎恶的；反感的 with ① the attention 后定 paid to worldly 尘世的；世俗的；世事的 goods, ② and the presence 存在；出现 of many "unholy" 不守教规的；亵渎神明的；罪恶的 faiths.

[.my2]
并非所有英国分离主义者, 都出发前往新世界。 +
第一批离开英国的人, 实际上是在 1608 年前往荷属荷兰。当他们的孩子开始说荷兰语并放弃英国传统时，他们对这片新土地感到不安。对分离主义者来说, 更糟糕的是，荷兰人对他们表现出的宽容, 也体现在对许多不同信仰的宽容。他们对"对世俗物品的关注"以及许多“不神圣”信仰的存在, 感到厌恶。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.pay ˈcourt to sb
( old-fashioned) to treat sb with great respect /in order to gain favour with them 献殷勤；奉迎；讨好

`主` The great Separatist experiment in the Netherlands `谓` came to a quick end, as they began to look elsewhere for a purer place to build their society. +
Some headed (v.) for English islands in the Caribbean. Those who would *be forever known* to future Americans *as* the Pilgrims 清教徒 /set their sights 视野 on the New World in late 1620.

[.my2]
在荷兰进行的伟大的分离主义实验, 很快就结束了，因为他们开始在其他地方寻找更纯粹的地方, 来建设他们的社会。有些前往加勒比海的英国​​岛屿。那些被未来的美国人永远称为“清教徒”的人, 于 1620 年底将目光投向了新大陆。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.set your sights on sth/on doing sth
to decide that you want sth and to try very hard to get it以…为奋斗目标；决心做到 +
- She's set her sights on getting into Harvard.她决心要上哈佛大学。
====

Over a hundred travelers embarked on the voyage (n.)航行 of the Mayflower in September 1620. Less than one third were Separatists. The rest were immigrants, adventurers, and speculators 投机商；投机倒把者.

[.my2]
1620 年 9 月，一百多名旅客踏上了五月花号的航行。其中不到三分之一是分离主义者。其余的是移民、冒险家和投机者。


`主` One of the greatest twists (n.)（故事或情况的）转折，转变，突然变化 of fate in human history `谓` occurred on that epochal 划时代的；新纪元的 voyage. +
The Pilgrims were originally bound 约束；迫使 for Virginia to live (v.) north of Jamestown /under the same charter 宪章,特许状，许可证 granted to citizens of Jamestown. +

Fate charted (v.)绘制（区域）的地图 a different course. Lost at sea, they *happened upon* 偶然遇到,偶然发现 a piece of land that would become known as Cape Cod. After surveying (v.)查看；审视；审察 the land, they *set up camp* not too far from PLYMOUTH ROCK.

[.my2]
人类历史上最伟大的命运转折之一, 发生在这次划时代的航行中。最初，清教徒（即朝圣者）是打算前往弗吉尼亚，在詹姆斯敦以北地区定居的，并且他们打算按照授予詹姆斯敦居民的相同宪章生活。但命运开辟了一条不同的道路。他们在海上迷路了，偶然发现了一块后来被称为"科德角"的土地。勘察完土地后，他们在距离"普利茅斯岩"不远的地方扎营。

[.my1]

"The Pilgrims were originally bound for Virginia"：清教徒原本是要前往弗吉尼亚的。 +
"to live north of Jamestown"：他们计划在詹姆斯敦以北地区生活。

The Pilgrims had an important question to answer before they set 放；置；使处于 ashore. Since they were not landing within the jurisdiction 管辖区域；管辖范围 ;司法权；审判权；管辖权 of the Virginia Company, they had no CHARTER to govern them. Who would rule (v.) their society?

[.my2]
清教徒们在上岸之前, 有一个重要的问题需要回答。由于他们不在弗吉尼亚公司的管辖范围内着陆，因此没有宪章来管理他们。谁来统治他们的社会？

In the landmark _MAYFLOWER COMPACT_ OF 1620, the Pilgrims decided that they would rule (v.) themselves, based on majority rule of the townsmen. +
This independent attitude set up a tradition of self-rule /that would later lead to TOWN MEETINGS 市镇会议 and elected legislatures 立法机关 in New England.

[.my2]
在 1620 年具有里程碑意义的《五月花契约》中，朝圣者决定在城镇居民多数人统治的基础上, 进行自我管理。这种独立的态度, 建立了一种自治的传统，后来导致了新英格兰的城镇会议和选举产生的立法机构。

Like the Virginia House of Burgesses established the previous year, _Plymouth colony_ began to lay (v.)铺，铺放，铺设（尤指在地板上） the foundation for democracy in the American colonies.

[.my2]
就像前一年成立的弗吉尼亚众议院一样，普利茅斯殖民地, 开始为美洲殖民地的民主奠定基础。



#The passengers# of the Arbella who left England in 1630 with their new charter 特许状，许可证，凭照  `谓` #had a great vision#. +
They were to be #an example# for the rest of the world #in rightful living#. +
Future governor JOHN WINTHROP stated (v.) their purpose quite clearly: "We shall be as a city upon a hill, the eyes of all people *are* upon us."

[.my2]
1630 年，阿贝拉号上的乘客带着他们的新许可证离开了英国，他们怀揣着伟大的愿景。他们将成为世界其他地区正确生活的榜样。未来的州长约翰·温思罗普 (JOHN WINTHROP) 非常明确地阐明了他们的目的：“我们将成为山上之城，所有人的目光都集中在我们身上。”

The Arbella was one of eleven ships 后定 carrying over a thousand Puritans 清教徒 to Massachusetts that year. +
It was the largest original venture 后定 ever attempted in the English New World.

The passengers were determined to be a beacon 灯塔 for the rest of Europe, "A Modell 模型 of Christian Charity 慈善机构（或组织）," in the words of the governor.

[.my2]
阿贝拉号, 是当年载着一千多名清教徒前往马萨诸塞州的 11 艘船之一。这是英国新世界有史以来最大的原创冒险活动。乘客们决心成为欧洲其他地区的灯塔，用州长的话来说，是“基督教慈善的典范”。


Puritans *believed in* PREDESTINATION 宿命论；命定说. +
This doctrine 教义；主义；学说；信条 holds that /God is all-powerful and all-knowing; therefore, the fate of each individual soul is known to God at birth.  +

#Nothing# 后定 an individual can do or say /`谓` #could change# their ultimate fate.  +
Puritans believed that /#those# chosen by God to be saved — the elect — #would experience# "CONVERSION." 转变；转换；转化;（宗教或信仰的）改变；皈依；归附 +

In this process, God would reveal to the individual His grace 恩宠, and the person would know he was saved.

[.my2]
清教徒相信预定论。该学说认为，上帝是全能、全知的。因此，每个灵魂的命运在出生时就为上帝所知。一个人所做或所说的任何事情, 都无法改变他们最终的命运。清教徒相信那些被上帝选中要得救的人——选民——会经历“转变”。在这个过程中，神会向个人显明他的恩典，这个人就会知道他已经得救了。


Only the elect could serve as Church members.  +
If a person were truly saved, he would only be capable of behavior (n.) 后定 endorsed (v.)（公开）赞同，支持，认可 by God.  +

These "living saints" 圣人，圣徒 would serve as an example to the rest of the world.  +
During the early years, ministers (新教)牧师 such as JOHN COTTON carefully screened (v.)筛查；检查 individuals 后定 claiming to have experienced conversion.

[.my2]
只有选民才能成为教会成员。一个人如果真正得救了，他只能做出神所认可的行为。这些“活着的圣人”将为世界其他地区树立榜样。早年，约翰·科顿（JOHN COTTON）等牧师仔细筛选了声称经历过转变的个人。


An elected legislature was established, echoing the desire 愿望；欲望 for self-government already seen in other English colonies. +
Although ministers 牧师 were prohibited from holding political office, many of the most important decisions were made by the clergy （统称）圣职人员，神职人员.  +
In 1636, HARVARD COLLEGE 哈佛学院 was instituted for the purpose of training Puritan ministers.

[.my2]
选举产生的立法机构成立，呼应了其他英国殖民地已经出现的自治愿望。尽管部长被禁止担任政治职务，但许多最重要的决定都是由神职人员做出的。 1636年，哈佛学院成立，旨在培养清教徒牧师。

By the end of the 1630s, as part of a "GREAT MIGRATION" of Puritans out of England, nearly 14,000 more Puritan settlers came to Massachusetts, and the colony began to spread.  +
In 1691, Plymouth colony, still without a charter, was absorbed by their burgeoning (a.)迅速发展的，快速生长的，繁荣的 neighbor to the West.

[.my2]
到 1630 年代末，作为清教徒离开英格兰的“大迁徙”的一部分，近 14,000 名清教徒定居者来到马萨诸塞州，殖民地开始扩张。 1691 年，尚未获得特许状的普利茅斯殖民地, 被其新兴的西方邻国吞并。

The great experiment seemed to be a smashing (a.)非常好的；十分愉快的;了不起的，极好的；粉碎性的，猛烈的 success for the first few decades.  +
In the end however, worldly concerns (n.) led to a decline in religious fervor /as the 1600s grew old.

[.my2]
这项伟大的实验在最初的几十年里似乎取得了巨大的成功。然而最终，随着 1600 年代的衰老，世俗的担忧导致宗教热情下降。


The Puritans believed /they were doing God's work.  Hence, there was little room for compromise.  +
Harsh punishment was inflicted (v.)使遭受打击；使吃苦头 on those who were seen as straying (v.) 迷路；偏离；走失 from God's work.  +
There were cases /when individuals of differing faiths were hanged in BOSTON COMMON 公共用地；公地.

[.my2]
清教徒相信他们正在做上帝的工作。因此，妥协的余地很小。那些被视为偏离上帝工作的人受到严厉的惩罚。曾有不同信仰的人在 BOSTON COMMON 被绞死的案例。

First, he preached (v.)布道，讲道; 宣传，宣讲 separation of church and state. He believed in complete RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, so no single church *should be supported by tax dollars*.  +
Massachusetts Puritans believed they had the one true faith; therefore such talk was intolerable.  +

Second, Williams claimed `主` taking land from the Native Americans without proper payment `系` was unfair.

[.my2]
罗杰威廉姆斯(清教徒牧师) 也有类似的威胁。
有两个想法, 让他在马萨诸塞湾陷入了大麻烦。首先，他宣扬"政教分离"。他相信完全的宗教自由，因此任何一个教会, 都不应该靠税收来支持。马萨诸塞州的清教徒相信, 他们拥有唯一的真正信仰。因此这种言论是无法容忍的。其次，威廉姆斯声称, 在没有适当付款的情况下, 从美洲原住民手中夺取土地是不公平的。

Although many differences separated Spain and France from England, perhaps the factor that contributed most to distinct paths of colonization was the form of their government.

Spain and France had absolute monarchies, but Britain had a limited monarchy. In New France and New Spain, all authority flowed from the Crown to the settlers, with no input from below.

An absolute monarchy is a state in which the monarch has sovereign power and controls all aspects of government without being checked by any representative assemblies.


A limited or constitutional monarchy is a state in which the power of the monarch is checked by other constitutionally sanctioned institutions, such as a REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY (e.g., the British Parliament).

The English kings who ruled the 13 original colonies reserved the right to decide the fate of their colonies as well, but not alone. The colonists drew upon their claims to traditional English rights and insisted on raising their own representative assemblies. Such was the case with the VIRGINIA HOUSE OF BURGESSES, the first popularly elected legislative body in the New World.

English landowners had insisted on meeting with their leaders for consultation in local matters ever since the MAGNA CARTA was signed in 1215. Virginia settlers expected that same right.

Modeled after the English Parliament, the General Assembly was established in 1619. In 1643 it became a bicameral body, establishing the House of Burgesses as one of its two chambers. Members would meet at least once a year with their royal governor to decide local laws and determine local taxation.


The FOUNDERS of the New England colonies had an entirely different mission from the Jamestown settlers. Although economic prosperity was still a goal of the New England settlers, their true goal was spiritual. Fed up with the ceremonial Church of England, Pilgrims and Puritans sought to recreate society in the manner they believed God truly intended it to be designed.

Where else but in the New World could such a golden opportunity be found? The land was unspoiled. Children could be raised without the corruption of old English religious ideas. The chance to create a perfect society was there for the taking. The Stuart kings saw America a means to get rid of troublemakers. Everything was falling into place.

By 1620, the seeds for a new society, quite different from the one already established at Jamestown, were planted deeply within the souls of a few brave pioneers. Their quest would form the basis of New England society.


Not all the English Separatists set out for the New World.

The first group to leave England actually headed for the Dutch Netherlands in 1608. They became uneasy in their new land as their children started speaking Dutch and abandoning English traditions. Even worse to the Separatists, the tolerance shown to them by the Dutch was shown to many different faiths. They became disgusted with the attention paid to worldly goods, and the presence of many "unholy" faiths.


The great Separatist experiment in the Netherlands came to a quick end, as they began to look elsewhere for a purer place to build their society. Some headed for English islands in the Caribbean. Those who would be forever known to future Americans as the Pilgrims set their sights on the New World in late 1620.

Over a hundred travelers embarked on the voyage of the Mayflower in September 1620. Less than one third were Separatists. The rest were immigrants, adventurers, and speculators.


One of the greatest twists of fate in human history occurred on that epochal voyage. The Pilgrims were originally bound for Virginia to live north of Jamestown under the same charter granted to citizens of Jamestown. Fate charted a different course. Lost at sea, they happened upon a piece of land that would become known as Cape Cod. After surveying the land, they set up camp not too far from PLYMOUTH ROCK.



The Pilgrims had an important question to answer before they set ashore. Since they were not landing within the jurisdiction of the Virginia Company, they had no CHARTER to govern them. Who would rule their society?

In the landmark MAYFLOWER COMPACT OF 1620, the Pilgrims decided that they would rule themselves, based on majority rule of the townsmen. This independent attitude set up a tradition of self-rule that would later lead to TOWN MEETINGS and elected legislatures in New England.

Like the Virginia House of Burgesses established the previous year, Plymouth colony began to lay the foundation for democracy in the American colonies.



The passengers of the Arbella who left England in 1630 with their new charter had a great vision. They were to be an example for the rest of the world in rightful living. Future governor JOHN WINTHROP stated their purpose quite clearly: "We shall be as a city upon a hill, the eyes of all people are upon us."

The Arbella was one of eleven ships carrying over a thousand Puritans to Massachusetts that year. It was the largest original venture ever attempted in the English New World. The passengers were determined to be a beacon for the rest of Europe, "A Modell of Christian Charity," in the words of the governor.


Puritans believed in PREDESTINATION. This doctrine holds that God is all-powerful and all-knowing; therefore, the fate of each individual soul is known to God at birth. Nothing an individual can do or say could change their ultimate fate. Puritans believed that those chosen by God to be saved — the elect — would experience "CONVERSION." In this process, God would reveal to the individual His grace, and the person would know he was saved.


Only the elect could serve as Church members. If a person were truly saved, he would only be capable of behavior endorsed by God. These "living saints" would serve as an example to the rest of the world. During the early years, ministers such as JOHN COTTON carefully screened individuals claiming to have experienced conversion.


An elected legislature was established, echoing the desire for self-government already seen in other English colonies. Although ministers were prohibited from holding political office, many of the most important decisions were made by the clergy. In 1636, HARVARD COLLEGE was instituted for the purpose of training Puritan ministers.

By the end of the 1630s, as part of a "GREAT MIGRATION" of Puritans out of England, nearly 14,000 more Puritan settlers came to Massachusetts, and the colony began to spread. In 1691, Plymouth colony, still without a charter, was absorbed by their burgeoning neighbor to the West.

The great experiment seemed to be a smashing success for the first few decades. In the end however, worldly concerns led to a decline in religious fervor as the 1600s grew old.


The Puritans believed they were doing God's work. Hence, there was little room for compromise. Harsh punishment was inflicted on those who were seen as straying from God's work. There were cases when individuals of differing faiths were hanged in BOSTON COMMON.


ROGER WILLIAMS was a similar threat.


Two ideas got him into big trouble in Massachusetts Bay. First, he preached separation of church and state. He believed in complete RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, so no single church should be supported by tax dollars. Massachusetts Puritans believed they had the one true faith; therefore such talk was intolerable. Second, Williams claimed taking land from the Native Americans without proper payment was unfair.


Massachusetts wasted no time in banishing the minister.

In 1636, he purchased land from the NARRAGANSETT Indians and founded the colony of RHODE ISLAND. Here there would be complete religious freedom. Dissenters from the English New World came here seeking refuge. Anne Hutchinson herself moved to Rhode Island before her fatal relocation to New York.

America has long been a land where people have reserved the right to say, "I disagree." Many early settlers left England in the first place because they disagreed with English practice. Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson were two brave souls who reminded everyone at their own great peril of that most sacred right.


Unlike solidly Puritan New England, the middle colonies presented an assortment of religions. The presence of Quakers, MENNONITES, LUTHERANS, DUTCH CALVINISTS, and PRESBYTERIANS made the dominance of one faith next to impossible.

Advantaged by their central location, the middle colonies served as important distribution centers in the English mercantile system. New York and Philadelphia grew at a fantastic rate. These cities gave rise to brilliant thinkers such as Benjamin Franklin, who earned respect on both sides of the Atlantic. In many ways, the middle colonies served as the crossroads of ideas during the colonial period.

The Dutch had no patience for democratic institutions. The point of the colony was to enrich its stockholders.

Slavery was common during the Dutch era, as the DUTCH WEST INDIA COMPANY was one of the most prominent in the world's trade of slaves.

When a powerful English military unit appeared in New Amsterdam, Governor Stuyvesant was forced to surrender and New Netherland became New York.

Virginia was the first successful southern colony.
