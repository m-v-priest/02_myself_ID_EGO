== (解说) 美国独立战争 1775—1783年 (共8年), 即中国乾隆时期.

On June 7, 1776, RICHARD HENRY LEE introduced a resolution 决议；正式决定 to the Congress /that declared the thirteen colonies "free and independent states. +
" Congress did not act (v.) on the resolution immediately. +
 A vote was set /for early July. +

In the meantime /it seemed appropriate 合适的；恰当的 /that some sort of explanation was in order （依法）有效的;正常；准备好；就绪;符合议事规则 /for such a bold act. +
 A subcommittee (委员会内的）小组委员会 of five, including Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and THOMAS JEFFERSON, was selected /to choose the careful wording  措辞；用词. +


[.my2]
1776 年 6 月 7 日，理查德·亨利·李向国会提出一项决议，宣布十三个殖民地为“自由独立国家”。国会没有立即对该决议采取行动。投票定于七月初进行。与此同时，对如此大胆的举动进行某种解释, 似乎是适当的。包括本杰明·富兰克林、约翰·亚当斯和托马斯·杰斐逊在内的五人小组委员会, 被选中来仔细选择措辞。

.subcommittee
-> [ C+sing./pl.v.] a smaller committee formed (v.) from a main committee in order to study a particular subject in more detail （委员会内的）小组委员会
====

The declaration is divided into three main parts. +
 The first was a simple statement of intent 意图；意向；目的. +
 Jefferson's words echo (v.)回响；回荡 down /through the decades of American life until the present day. +

`主` Phrases like "ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL," "unalienable
不可剥夺的 rights," and "life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness" `谓` HAVE BOUNCED from the lips of Americans in grammar school and retirement. +
All are contained in the first section /that outlines (v.)概述；略述;显示…的轮廓；勾勒…的外形 the basic principles of the enlightened 开明的；有见识的；摆脱偏见的 leaders. +

The next section is a list of grievances 不平的事；委屈；抱怨；牢骚; that is, why the colonies deemed  (v.)认为；视为；相信 independence appropriate. +
 King George was guilty (a.) of 犯了罪；有过失的；有罪责的 "repeated injuries" 伤害，伤痛 /that intended (v.)打算；计划；想要 to establish "ABSOLUTE TYRANNY" (n.)暴虐；专横；苛政；专政 in North America. +

He has "plundered (v.)（尤指战乱时用武力）抢劫，掠夺 our seas, burned our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. +
" It was difficult for Americans to argue 争辩 his points. +

The concluding (a.)最后的，结尾的 paragraph （文章的）段，段落 officially dissolves (v.)解除（婚姻关系）；终止（商业协议）；解散（议会） ties with Britain. +
 It also shows modern readers the courage /taken by each delegate who would sign. +

They were now officially guilty (a.) of 犯了罪；有过失的；有罪责的 treason 危害国家罪，叛国罪 /and would hang in the gallows 绞刑架；绞台 /if taken before a royal court. +
 Thus, they would "pledge (v.)保证给予（或做）；正式承诺 to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred 上帝的；神的；神圣的 honor. " +

[.my2]
声明分为三个主要部分。第一个是简单的意向声明。杰斐逊的话在美国几十年的生活中回响，直到今天。 “人人生而平等”、“不可剥夺的权利”和“生命、自由和追求幸福”等短语, 在文法学校, 和退休后的美国人口中不断出现。所有内容都包含在第一部分中，概述了开明领导人的基本原则。下一部分是申诉清单；这就是为什么殖民地认为独立是适当的。乔治国王犯有“屡次伤害”罪，意图在北美建立“绝对暴政”。他“掠夺了我们的海洋，烧毁了我们的城镇，摧毁了我们人民的生活”。美国人很难反驳他的观点。最后一段正式解除与英国的关系。它还向现代读者展示了每位签名代表所具有的勇气。他们现在被正式犯有叛国罪，如果被带到皇家法庭，他们将被绞死在绞刑架上。因此，他们将“互相保证我们的生命、我们的财富, 和我们神圣的荣誉”。

.pledge
1.(v.) ~ sth (to sb/sth) : to formally promise to give or do sth保证给予（或做）；正式承诺
[ VN] +
- The government pledged their support for the plan.政府保证支持这项计划。 +
2.(v.)~ sb/yourself (to sth) : to make sb or yourself formally promise to do sth使保证；使发誓
====

Debate in the Congress followed. +
 Jefferson watched painfully /as the other delegates tweaked (v.)稍稍调整（机器、系统等） his prose 散文. +

Jefferson had wanted to include a passage blaming the king for the slave trade, for example, but the southern delegates insisted upon 坚决要求 its removal 移动；调动；去除. +

Finally on July 4, 1776, the colonies approved the document. +
 The vote was twelve to zero, with the New York delegation abstaining (v.)（投票时）弃权. +
 As president of the Congress, John Hancock scrawled (v.)马马虎虎（或潦草）地写 his famous signature across the bottom /and history was made. +

If the American effort was successful, they would be hailed (v.)赞扬，欢呼；呼喊 as heroes. +
 If it failed, they would be hanged as traitors 背叛者；叛徒；卖国贼. +


[.my2]
接下来是国会的辩论。杰斐逊痛苦地看着其他代表修改他的散文。例如，杰斐逊曾想加入一段指责国王从事奴隶贸易的段落，但南方代表坚持将其删除。最终，1776 年 7 月 4 日，殖民地批准了该文件。投票结果为十二比零，纽约代表团弃权。作为国会主席，约翰·汉考克在底部潦草地写下了他著名的签名，历史就此被创造。如果这些美国人的努力成功，他们将被誉为英雄。如果失败，他们将被当作叛徒绞死。

Americans faced (v.) seemingly impossible obstacles. +
 When the guns fired (v.) at Lexington and Concord in 1775, there was not yet even a Continental Army. +

Those battles were fought by local militias 民兵组织. +
 Few Americans had any 任何的，任一的 military experience, and there was no method of training, supplying, or paying an army. +


[.my2]
美国人面临着看似不可能的障碍。 1775 年，当炮火向列克星敦和康科德开火时，当时甚至还没有一支大陆军。这些战斗是由当地民兵进行的。很少有美国人有军事经验，也没有训练、补给或支付军队费用的方法。

Moreover, a majority of Americans opposed 反对（计划、政策等）；抵制；阻挠 the war in 1775. +
 Many historians believe /only about a third of all Americans supported a war against the British /at that time. +
Further, the Colonies had a poor track 足迹，踪迹；车辙 record of working together. +
How, then, could a ragtag (a.)组织散漫的；杂乱的；给人印象差的 group of patriots defeat the British? +



[.my2]
此外，大多数美国人反对 1775 年的战争。许多历史学家认为，当时只有大约三分之一的美国人支持对英国发动战争。
此外，殖民地之间的合作记录不佳。
那么，一群乌合之众的爱国者如何能够击败英国人呢？

The early stages of war, in 1775, can be best described as British military victories (n.)胜利；成功 /and American moral triumphs  巨大成功；重大成就；伟大胜利.

[.my2]
1775 年战争的早期阶段, 可以用英国的军事胜利, 和美国的道德胜利来形容。


Regardless, by 1777 /the British occupied Philadelphia, the seat （尤指大学或政府机关）所在地；中心;座位，坐处（如椅子等） of the Continental Congress, and sent that body into hiding 体罚；痛打. +
 The British also controlled New York City /and pretty much had their way 地区；地带 in the waters 后定 along the Eastern Seaboard. +

In fact, there was no Continental Navy to speak of at this time. +
 Meanwhile, the British began mounting (v.)准备；安排；组织开展 a southward attack from Canada into upstate (a.)在（或向）州的乡野地区（尤指北部） New York. +
This threatened (v.) to cut New England off from the rest of the Colonies. +

[.my2]
不管怎样，到 1777 年，英国占领了大陆会议所在地费城，并将会议机构藏了起来。英国人还控制了纽约市，并在东海岸沿线的水域中占据了很大的份额。事实上，此时还没有大陆海军可言。与此同时，英国人开始从加拿大向南进攻纽约州北部。这有可能切断新英格兰与其他殖民地的联系。

Washington, having lost (v.) Philadelphia, led his troops to Valley Forge to spend the winter. +
 None of the world's powers had come to the aid of the patriot cause — yet. +

[.my2]
纽约北部的萨拉托加战役, 是一个关键的转折点。英国占领哈德逊河谷的企图, 以十月向霍雷肖·盖茨将军投降而告终。失去费城后，华盛顿率军前往福吉谷过冬。目前为止，世界上还没有任何一个国家对爱国事业提供援助。



In early 1778, the French agreed to recognize American independence /and formed a permanent alliance with the new nation. +
 `主` Military help and sizable 相当大的，颇大的 stores 贮存物；备用物 of much-needed gunpowder  火药 `谓` soon arrived. +
 The tide 潮流；趋势；动向 was beginning to turn. +


[.my2]
1778 年初，法国同意承认美国独立，并与这个新国家结成永久联盟。军事援助和大量急需的火药储备很快就到达了。潮流开始转变。

 The loss （比赛等的）失败，失利 at Saratoga was humiliating (a.)使蒙受耻辱的. +

Capturing the enemy's capital, Philadelphia, did not bring them much advantage. +
 As long as `主` the American Continental Army and state militias `谓` remained in the field, the British had to keep on fighting. +

[.my2]
英国人越来越沮丧。萨拉托加的失利是一种耻辱。攻占敌人的首都费城, 并没有给他们带来多少优势。只要美国大陆军和州民兵仍在战场上，英国人就必须继续战斗。


Having failed in the north, the British turned their attention to the south. +
 They hoped to inspire (v.)鼓舞; 激励 Loyalist (n.)（尤指在变动时期对统治者、政府或政党）忠诚的人 support among dissatisfied Americans — a hope that was never realized (a.v.)实现；将…变为现实. +

Fighting continued. +
 The threat of French naval participation kept the British uneasy. +


[.my2]
在北方失败后，英国人将注意力转向南方。他们希望激发不满的美国人对效忠派的支持——这一希望从未实现。战斗仍在继续。法国海军参与的威胁让英国感到不安。

.having done 表此非谓语动词, 早于主句的谓语动词发生. 所以一般作“时间状语”，也有可能成为“原因状语”。 having done 表示的是"主动"，having been done 表示的是"被动"。 +

It is impossible to know the exact number of American colonists who favored (v.) or opposed (v.) independence.

[.my2]
我们不可能知道"支持或反对独立"的美国殖民者的确切人数。

For years /it was widely believed that one third favored (v.) the Revolution, one third opposed (v.) it, and one third were undecided (a.). +
This `谓`  stems (v.) from an estimate 后定 made by John Adams in his personal writings in 1815.

[.my2]
多年来，人们普遍认为三分之一的人支持革命，三分之一的人反对革命，还有三分之一的人尚未做出决定。这源于约翰·亚当斯 1815 年在其个人著作中做出的估计。

Historians have since concluded that /Adams was referring 提到；谈及；说起;描述；涉及；与…相关 to American attitudes 后定 toward the French Revolution, not ours. +
The current thought is that about 20 percent of the colonists were LOYALISTS — those 后定 whose remained loyal to England and King George. +

`主` Another small group in terms of 就……而言；从……角度来看；就……方面而言 percentage `系` were the dedicated 献身的：专心致志的；一心一意的 PATRIOTS 爱国者, for whom /there was no alternative but independence.


[.my2]
此后历史学家得出的结论是，亚当斯指的是美国人对法国大革命的态度，而不是我们的态度。目前的观点是，大约 20% 的殖民者是保皇派——那些仍然忠于英格兰和乔治国王的人。从百分比来看，另一个小群体是忠诚的爱国者，他们除了独立别无选择。

Often overlooked `系`  are the fence-sitters 中立，中立者 who made up the largest group.

[.my2]
经常被忽视的, 是构成最大群体的中立派。

With so many Americans undecided (a.), `主` the war `谓` became [in great measure] a battle 后定 to win popular support. +
If the patriots could succeed in selling their ideas of revolution to the public, then `主` popular support `谓` might follow /and the British would be doomed (v.)使…注定失败（或遭殃、死亡等）,(a.)注定的，命定的；注定要失败的.

[.my2]
由于如此多的美国人犹豫不决，战争在很大程度上变成了一场赢得民众支持的战争。如果爱国者能够成功地向公众推销他们的革命思想，那么民众的支持可能会随之而来，而英国人将注定失败。

Even with military victory, it would have been impossible for the Crown to regain the allegiance （对政党、宗教、统治者的）忠诚，效忠，拥戴 of the people. +
Revolution would merely flare (v.) up (火焰、火等)突然旺起来;复发；突然加剧 at a later date.

[.my2]
即使取得了军事上的胜利，英国国王也不可能重新获得美国人民的效忠。殖民地的革命只会在晚些时候爆发。

In the long run 从长远来看, however, the patriots were much more successful attracting support. +
American patriots won the war of propaganda. +
Committees of Correspondence persuaded many fence-sitters to join the patriot cause.

[.my2]
然而，从长远来看，爱国者队更成功地吸引了支持。美国爱国者赢得了宣传战。通讯委员会说服了许多中立者加入爱国事业。


Patriots subjected (v.)使经受；使遭受 Loyalists to public humiliation and violence. +
Many Loyalists found their property vandalized (v.)肆意破坏（私人或公共财物）, looted (v.)抢劫，掠夺, and burned. +

[.my2]
爱国者让效忠派遭受公开羞辱和暴力。许多效忠派发现他们的财产遭到破坏、抢劫和焚烧。爱国者控制了公众话语。公开表示同情英国的公民有祸了。

[.my1]

====

In the end, many Loyalists simply left America. +
About 80,000 of them fled to Canada or Britain /during or just after the war. +

Because Loyalists were often wealthy, educated, older, and Anglican 圣公会教徒, the American social fabric （社会、机构等的）结构;织物；布料 was altered (v.)（使）改变，更改，改动 by their departure. +

American history brands (v.)给（牲畜）打烙印;（尤指不公正地）丑化（某人），败坏（某人）名声 them as traitors. +

After all, history is always written by the winners.

[.my2]
最终，许多效忠派干脆离开了美国。其中约 80,000 人在战争期间或战争结束后逃往加拿大或英国。由于效忠派通常富有、受过教育、年龄较大并且是英国圣公会教徒，因此美国的社会结构因他们的离开而发生了改变。美国历史将他们标记为叛徒。但大多数人只是试图维持他们已经习惯的生活方式。毕竟，历史总是由胜利者书写的。

As the British entered major cities such as Boston, Philadelphia, and New York, many people fled to the countryside, looking for food and work. +

Traditional markets were disrupted 扰乱；使中断；打乱. +
`主` Farmers who one week sold their wares to their usual American customers `谓` might the next week be selling to an occupying British army.

[.my2]
战争期间, 随着英国人进入波士顿、费城和纽约等主要城市，许多人逃到乡村寻找食物和工作。传统市场被扰乱。一周将商品卖给他们通常的美国客户的农民可能会在下周卖给一支占领的英国军队。


The BRITISH BLOCKADE （尤指对港口的）包围，封锁 caused widespread UNEMPLOYMENT. +

[.my2]
英国的封锁造成了广泛的失业。从托运人到商人，几乎所有依赖国外市场的人都失业了。两支军队有时都会被愿意以任何方式工作的男男女女跟着，只为了吃一顿热饭。殖民地经济一片混乱。

Violence sometimes came (v.) in the wake of 随…之后而来；跟随在…后 rising prices, and the Continental Congress enacted (v.)通过（法律） regulations /to counter (v.)抵制；抵消;反驳；驳斥 inflation throughout the Colonies.

[.my2]
一些农民和商人希望从稀缺性涨价中获利。许多人将他们的商品卖给英国军队。物价上涨有时会引发暴力，大陆会议颁布法规来对抗整个殖民地的通货膨胀。

When the men went off 离开（尤指去做某事） to fight in the war, American women, children, and elderly were frequently faced with the occupation of their houses, churches, and government buildings by British soldiers.

[.my2]
当男人们去参战时，美国妇女、儿童和老人经常面临着英国士兵占领他们的房屋、教堂和政府大楼的情况。

Women stepped forth /to fill (v.) holes 后定 left by fighting Continental soldiers. +
Women needed to perform tasks 后定 formerly reserved 保留；贮备 for their husbands (such as farming or running businesses).

如果没有他们配偶的努力，许多男人在战后可能会再次破产。


American spirits reached a low point during the harsh winter of 1777-78.

[.my2]
1777-78 年的严冬期间，美国人的精神达到了最低点。

British troops had marched triumphantly into Philadelphia /the previous autumn. +
Philadelphia was the largest city in the Colonies /and the seat of political power. +
After the British swept into Philadelphia, the Continental Congress had flee to west, first to Lancaster /then to York.

[.my2]
去年秋天，英国军队胜利进军费城。费城是殖民地最大的城市和政治权力所在地。英国人席卷费城后，大陆会议逃往西部，先是兰开斯特，然后又逃到约克。

On June 7, 1776, RICHARD HENRY LEE introduced a resolution to the Congress that declared the thirteen colonies "free and independent states." Congress did not act on the resolution immediately. A vote was set for early July. In the meantime it seemed appropriate that some sort of explanation was in order for such a bold act. A subcommittee of five, including Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and THOMAS JEFFERSON, was selected to choose the careful wording.

The declaration is divided into three main parts. The first was a simple statement of intent. Jefferson's words echo down through the decades of American life until the present day. Phrases like "ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL," "unalienable rights," and "life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness" have bounced from the lips of Americans in grammar school and retirement. All are contained in the first section that outlines the basic principles of the enlightened leaders. The next section is a list of grievances; that is, why the colonies deemed independence appropriate. King George was guilty of "repeated injuries" that intended to establish "ABSOLUTE TYRANNY" in North America. He has "plundered our seas, burned our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people." It was difficult for Americans to argue his points. The concluding paragraph officially dissolves ties with Britain. It also shows modern readers the courage taken by each delegate who would sign. They were now officially guilty of treason and would hang in the gallows if taken before a royal court. Thus, they would "pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor."


Debate in the Congress followed. Jefferson watched painfully as the other delegates tweaked his prose. Jefferson had wanted to include a passage blaming the king for the slave trade, for example, but the southern delegates insisted upon its removal. Finally on July 4, 1776, the colonies approved the document. The vote was twelve to zero, with the New York delegation abstaining. As president of the Congress, John Hancock scrawled his famous signature across the bottom and history was made. If the American effort was successful, they would be hailed as heroes. If it failed, they would be hanged as traitors.






Americans faced seemingly impossible obstacles. When the guns fired at Lexington and Concord in 1775, there was not yet even a Continental Army. Those battles were fought by local militias. Few Americans had any military experience, and there was no method of training, supplying, or paying an army.

Moreover, a majority of Americans opposed the war in 1775. Many historians believe only about a third of all Americans supported a war against the British at that time.

Further, the Colonies had a poor track record of working together.

How, then, could a ragtag group of patriots defeat the British?

The early stages of war, in 1775, can be best described as British military victories and American moral triumphs.


Regardless, by 1777 the British occupied Philadelphia, the seat of the Continental Congress, and sent that body into hiding. The British also controlled New York City and pretty much had their way in the waters along the Eastern Seaboard. In fact, there was no Continental Navy to speak of at this time. Meanwhile, the British began mounting a southward attack from Canada into upstate New York. This threatened to cut New England off from the rest of the Colonies.

The Battle of Saratoga, in northern New York, served as a critical turning point. The British attempt to capture the Hudson River Valley ended with their surrender to General Horatio Gates in October. Washington, having lost Philadelphia, led his troops to Valley Forge to spend the winter. None of the world's powers had come to the aid of the patriot cause — yet.

In early 1778, the French agreed to recognize American independence and formed a permanent alliance with the new nation. Military help and sizable stores of much-needed gunpowder soon arrived. The tide was beginning to turn.


The British grew increasingly frustrated. The loss at Saratoga was humiliating. Capturing the enemy's capital, Philadelphia, did not bring them much advantage. As long as the American Continental Army and state militias remained in the field, the British had to keep on fighting.


Having failed in the north, the British turned their attention to the south. They hoped to inspire Loyalist support among dissatisfied Americans — a hope that was never realized. Fighting continued. The threat of French naval participation kept the British uneasy.

In October 1781, the war virtually came to an end when General Cornwallis was surrounded and forced to surrender the British position at Yorktown, Virginia. Two years later, the Treaty of Paris made it official: America was independent.

It is impossible to know the exact number of American colonists who favored or opposed independence.

For years it was widely believed that one third favored the Revolution, one third opposed it, and one third were undecided. This stems from an estimate made by John Adams in his personal writings in 1815.

Historians have since concluded that Adams was referring to American attitudes toward the French Revolution, not ours. The current thought is that about 20 percent of the colonists were LOYALISTS — those whose remained loyal to England and King George. Another small group in terms of percentage were the dedicated PATRIOTS, for whom there was no alternative but independence.

Often overlooked are the fence-sitters who made up the largest group.

With so many Americans undecided, the war became in great measure a battle to win popular support. If the patriots could succeed in selling their ideas of revolution to the public, then popular support might follow and the British would be doomed.

Even with military victory, it would have been impossible for the Crown to regain the allegiance of the people. Revolution would merely flare up at a later date.

In the long run, however, the patriots were much more successful attracting support. American patriots won the war of propaganda. Committees of Correspondence persuaded many fence-sitters to join the patriot cause.


Patriots subjected Loyalists to public humiliation and violence. Many Loyalists found their property vandalized, looted, and burned. The patriots controlled public discourse. Woe to the citizen who publicly proclaimed sympathy to Britain.

In the end, many Loyalists simply left America. About 80,000 of them fled to Canada or Britain during or just after the war. Because Loyalists were often wealthy, educated, older, and Anglican, the American social fabric was altered by their departure. American history brands them as traitors. But most were just trying to maintain the lifestyles to which they had become accustomed. After all, history is always written by the winners.

As the British entered major cities such as Boston, Philadelphia, and New York, many people fled to the countryside, looking for food and work. Traditional markets were disrupted. Farmers who one week sold their wares to their usual American customers might the next week be selling to an occupying British army.


The BRITISH BLOCKADE caused widespread UNEMPLOYMENT. Almost anyone dependent on the foreign market was out of work, from shippers to merchants. Both armies were sometimes followed by men and women willing to work in any way for a hot meal. The Colonial economy was in shambles.

Some farmers and merchants hoped to profit from increased prices due to scarcity. Many sold their wares to the British army. Violence sometimes came in the wake of rising prices, and the Continental Congress enacted regulations to counter inflation throughout the Colonies.

When the men went off to fight in the war, American women, children, and elderly were frequently faced with the occupation of their houses, churches, and government buildings by British soldiers.

Women stepped forth to fill holes left by fighting Continental soldiers. Women needed to perform tasks formerly reserved for their husbands (such as farming or running businesses).


Many men would have returned to bankruptcy after the war had it not been for the efforts of their spouses.


American spirits reached a low point during the harsh winter of 1777-78.

British troops had marched triumphantly into Philadelphia the previous autumn. Philadelphia was the largest city in the Colonies and the seat of political power. After the British swept into Philadelphia, the Continental Congress had flee to west, first to Lancaster then to York.


Washington's army had spent the summer of 1777 fighting a string of losing battles. The Americans harassed the British army in skirmishes and minor battles for much of the fighting season. In the fall, the Americans showed pluck at the BATTLE OF BRANDYWINE in September and the BATTLE OF GERMANTOWN in October. Yet the Americans were unable to keep the British out of Philadelphia.

In December, Washington marched his tired, beaten, hungry and sick army to VALLEY FORGE, a location about 20 miles northwest of British-occupied Philadelphia. From Valley Forge, Washington could keep an eye on General Howe's British army ensconced in Philadelphia.

At Valley Forge, there were shortages of everything from food to clothing to medicine. Washington's men were sick from disease, hunger, and exposure. The Continental Army camped in crude LOG CABINS and endured cold conditions while the Redcoats warmed themselves in colonial homes. The patriots went hungry while the British soldiers ate well.

Terms of enlistment were ending for many soldiers in Washington's army. The General wondered if he would even have an army left when the spring thaw finally arrived.

General Washington was upset that local farmers were hoarding much-needed food waiting to earn higher profits in the spring. Some farmers even sneaked grain into Philadelphia to feed the British army, who paid in gold or silver. With each passing night came more desertions. Washington grew privately disgusted at the lack of commitment of his so-called patriot fighters.

Then there was the grumbling of some in Congress and among some of Washington's own officers. Washington's leadership skills were openly questioned. Many said General Horatio Gates was better-suited to leading the army. After all, hadn't he scored a major victory in October at the battle of Saratoga.? Within the environment of cold, deprivation, and rebellion, how long could Washington and his army endure?


Over the course of the winter, the weather improved somewhat. Food trickled in from the surrounding countryside. Many wives of soldiers spent time at Valley Forge over the winter. Washington was able to quash those who questioned his leadership abilities.

The Continental Army encamped at Valley Forge in the fall of 1777 with about 12,000 men in its ranks. Death claimed about a quarter of them before spring arrived. Another thousand didn't reenlist or deserted. But the army that remained was stronger. They were fewer, but more disciplined. They were weary, but firmly resolved.

The next year, 1778, brought greater fortune to the American cause. While Washington froze at Valley Forge, Benjamin Franklin was busy securing the French alliance. Now the war would be different indeed.

The BATTLE OF SARATOGA was the turning point of the Revolutionary War.


A stupendous American victory in October 1777, the success at Saratoga gave France the confidence in the American cause to enter the war as an American ALLY. Later American successes owed a great deal to French aid in the form of financial and military assistance.

As early as 1774, VERGENNES, the French foreign minister, had sent secret emissaries to explore the American colonists' commitment to independence. In the spring of 1776, Congress dispatched SILAS DEANE to France as a secret commercial agent to see if he could make arrangements for the purchase of military supplies on terms of credit. Deane also made inquiries into possible French political and even military assistance.

Watchful waiting by French diplomacy came to an end when the news of the surrender of Burgoyne's army at Saratoga reached Paris on December 4, 1777. Two FRANCO-AMERICAN TREATIES were rapidly concluded. The first was a treaty of amity and commerce, which bestowed most-favored nation trading privileges and also contained cooperative maritime provisions.

The second was a treaty of "CONDITIONAL AND DEFENSIVE ALLIANCE." It provided, among other things, that in case war should break out between France and Great Britain as a result of the first treaty, France and America should fight the war together, and neither would make a peace or truce with the enemy without the formal consent of the other. Nor would they "lay down their arms until the Independence of the united states shall have been formally or tacitly assured by the Treaty or Treaties that shall terminate the War."


Although the American military was still enduring losses in 1780, the French were making a difference. The French navy was disrupting the British blockade.

Although, the British occupied much of the south, they had still been unable to mobilize the local Loyalists. Grumbling in England grew louder over the war's expense and duration. The morale of Washington's men was improving. The war was by no means over, but the general could now see a bright side.

the Battle of Yorktown turned the British public against the war. The following March, a pro-American Parliament was elected and peace negotiations began in earnest.


Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and JOHN JAY met with the British in the hopes of securing a peace treaty.

In the 1783 TREATY OF PARIS the British agreed to recognize American independence as far west as the Mississippi River. Americans agreed to honor debts owed to British merchants from before the war and to stop persecuting British Loyalists.

David had triumphed over Goliath. Independence was achieved at last!
