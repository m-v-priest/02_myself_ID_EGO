[.my1]
.案例
====
.van·illa 
[ U]a substance obtained from the beans of a tropical plant, also called vanilla , used to give flavour to sweet foods, for example ice cream香草醛，香草香精（从热带植物香子兰豆中提取，用于冰激凌等甜食）

-> vanilla 是兰科热带植物，汉语名叫“香子兰”，俗称“香草”。西式点心几乎必备的香草精就是取自香子兰。vanilla一词来自西班牙语vaina 'sheath'（鞘）的指小词vainilla 'little sheath'（小鞘），而西班牙语vaina则源自拉丁语vāgīna 'sheath'（鞘）。顺便提一下，英语人体解剖学用语vagina（阴道）就是直接借自拉丁语的这个词的。它开初只是作为戏称用于此义，因其亦属鞘状物。

Robbie: I'll have vanilla 我要香草的. Is that all right with everyone? 各位有意见吗  +
Philip: I'll have chocolate 我要巧克力的. +
Marllyn: Me, too. +
Richard: Uh, one scoop 一勺（的量） of coffee and one scoop of chocolate for me. +
Ellen: Robbie, will you help me serve (v.) 给人端食物或饮料? +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.will you help me serve (v.)?
这里"serve" 是动词，意思是“服务”或“提供帮助”。完整意思是“你愿意帮助我服务吗？”或“你愿意帮助我提供服务吗？” +
如果去掉 "serve"，句子变成 "Will you help me?" 意思是“你愿意帮助我吗？” 句子的意思就变得更加笼统，不明确具体要帮助做什么。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.up the street
idiom +
: some distance away on the same street 在有一段距离的同一条街上. +
*up the street = 就在同一条街上.
也可以说down the street. 注意这个用法中 up/down 一般并不表示"上/下", 只是表示同一条街上.*

In many cases, the prepositional phrases "up the street" and "down the street" mean the same thing, and either one is appropriate. +
*在许多情况下，介词短语“up the street”和“down the street”表示相同的意思，任何一个都是合适的。*

If a friend called to ask you where the new movie theater was, you could answer either “It’s right *up the street* from the Japanese restaurant,” or “It’s just *down the street* from the Japanese restaurant,” and either way they would understand (v.) what you meant: It’s near the Japanese restaurant, on the same street.
如果一个朋友打电话问你新的电影院在哪里，你可以回答“它就在日本餐馆的街上”，或者“它就在日本餐馆的街上”，无论哪种方式，他们都会明白什么你的意思是：它在日本餐馆附近，在同一条街上。

However, here are some important factors to keep in mind: +
但是，请记住以下一些重要因素：


“Down the street” is much more common than "up the street." According to one English language corpus (or large data set), people use the expression “down the street” five times more often than they use “up the street.” +
**“Down the street”比“up the street”更常见。**根据一个英语语料库（或大型数据集），人们使用“down the street”一词的频率是“up the street”的五倍。


In almost all cases, it’s correct to use “down the street.” However, if the street is on a hill, use “up the street” when talking about something that is further uphill, and “down the street” when it’s further downhill. +
**几乎在所有情况下，使用“down the street”都是正确的。但是，如果街道位于山上，则在谈论更上坡的事物时使用“up the street”，而在谈论更下坡的事物时使用“down the street”。**


Many people recommend using “up the street” to mean, “the direction in which the house or building numbers are going up,” and using “down the street” to mean the other way. +
*许多人建议使用“up the street”来表示“房屋或建筑物编号向上的方向”，并使用“down the street”来表示相反的方向。*


Finally, in the expression "up and down the street" meaning "both ways," up always comes first.
最后，在表达“上下街道”（意思是“双向”）时，向上总是排在第一位。

Richard: Well, you really saved the day 挽救局势 for me, Alexandra. +
Alexandra: Bye. +
Richard: Bye-bye. +
Ellen: Good night. +
Philip: She's a smart young lady, and very nice. +
Robbie: Very! Hey, she forgot her bag! +
Ellen: I guess we'll be seeing Alexandra again, Right, Robbie?
