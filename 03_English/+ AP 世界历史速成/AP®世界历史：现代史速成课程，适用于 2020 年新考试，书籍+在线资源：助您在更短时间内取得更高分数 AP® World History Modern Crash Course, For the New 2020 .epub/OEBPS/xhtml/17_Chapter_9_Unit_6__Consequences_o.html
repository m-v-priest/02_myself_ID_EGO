<p class="C916">This chapter focuses on the causes and effects of Imperialism—the movement by many newly industrialized states in the 19th and early 20th centuries to build empires of colonies around the world. In the 21st century, the term “global empire” has a negative connotation, but one hundred years ago, all advanced countries sought an empire. The Western European powers—and to a lesser extent the U.S. and Japan—established empires outside their borders. Western Europe’s empires were global, with territories in Africa, Asia, North and South America, Australia and islands in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans.</p>
<p class="C916">You remember reading about the first era of European imperialism in the 16th and 17th centuries. Then, the focus was on the Americas. In the late 18th and through the 19th centuries, the nations of Europe restarted the process, but this time Africa and Asia were the primary targets. Ironically, during this age of “new” Imperialism, Spain and Portugal, two of the greatest empires of the previous era, began to decline in global power.</p>

<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Using inventions of the Industrial Revolution such as steamboats, railroads, and machine guns, Western European nations could subdue peoples in Africa with the new technologies.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>As a result, for the first time, many Europeans with superior military forces reached into the interior of Africa.</p>

<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span> <strong>NATIONALISM</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Nationalism—a sense of pride and devotion to one’s country—was a powerful force in Europe and the Americas in the early 19th century. It was an important factor in empire building in this era. National pride was a cause of imperialism in two ways:</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>Older European nations engaged in unofficial competitions to see who could grab the most territory around the world. It was a kind of rivalry. If Britain claimed <em>this</em>, then France wanted <em>that</em>, and on it went.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>New nation-states such as Germany and Italy wanted to show that they belonged with the “Great Powers,” so they got into the imperialism game as well. Britain’s territories were so vast, they proudly boasted, “The sun never sets on the British Empire.” By the end of this era, Britain’s imperial possessions covered one-fourth of the Earth.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>ECONOMICS</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Controlling world markets was an objective harking back to the first round of European imperialism in the 16th and 17th centuries. (See the section on mercantilism in <a href="15_Chapter_7_Unit_4__Transoceanic_I.html#page_53">Chapter 7</a>.) In this “new” imperialism, not only were governments and their treasuries involved, but also transnational corporations, such as the ones noted in the last chapter.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>These corporations put pressure on governments to help them claim their “share” of the global economy. The economic stakes were greater because the amount and value of global trade was also greater.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Africa and Asia held vast amounts of raw materials that industrialized nations wanted to keep their economies booming, like cotton, rubber, and minerals. In addition, European imperialists saw Africa and Asia as great potential markets for their mass-produced goods like cloth and steel.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong><span id="page_87"/>D.</strong></span><strong>“THE WHITE MAN’S BURDEN”</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>This cause is tricky to define. The Europeans generally believed they were doing their “little brown brothers” of Africa, Asia, and Oceania (the Pacific Ocean region) a favor by conquering them. After all, they reasoned, the Europeans developed the inventions of the Industrial Revolution that made it possible to travel around the world. To many Europeans, bringing “them” technology, plus education, medicine, and Christianity was a noble cause.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>The British writer of <em>The Jungle Book</em>, Rudyard Kipling, wrote a poem entitled “The White Man’s Burden” about these ideas. This concept is strongly connected to Social Darwinism, explained below.</p>

<p class="C916">Before industrialization, Europe lacked the ability to move south of the Sahara Desert into Africa’s interior. In the 16th century, the Portuguese set up some military outposts around South Africa’s Cape of Good Hope and along the rim of the Indian Ocean, but did not establish any colonies. Within a hundred years, Europeans were transporting slaves from the Atlantic coast of Africa to the Americas but, again, did not establish colonies along West Africa’s coast. The Dutch East India Company (the “VOC”—see <a href="15_Chapter_7_Unit_4__Transoceanic_I.html#page_53">Chapter 7</a>) established a colony at Cape Town, South Africa in the mid-17th century and over the next hundred years, Dutch settlers established farms throughout the region.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>EUROPEAN EXPANSION</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>In the early 1800s, British settlers moved to South Africa, causing strife with the Dutch colonists (“Boers”)—as well as heightening tensions between the Dutch and the native Africans living there.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>In the 1830s, France followed Britain’s example and became a major African colonial power, first in Algeria and then across most of Northwest Africa.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Belgium began the infamous European “Scramble for Africa” in the 1880s by grabbing an enormous area in the “heart” of Africa—the Belgian Congo. When other European powers <span id="page_88"/>realized Belgium had become a major colonial power, they began a rush to outdo each other in gaining territories.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>The “Great Powers” of Europe met at the Berlin Conference of 1885 to divide Africa among themselves peacefully. Not invited to participate was anyone <em>from</em> Africa. Clearly, this led to problems. Europeans’ confidence in their racial and cultural superiority did not leave much room for debate about the potential “down side” of imperialism. <em>Social Darwinism</em>—the theory that civilizations with superior technology and tactics <em>deserved</em> to conquer those without—was a powerful force in the West. By 1914, the sweep of European colonialism was so complete that only two areas in Africa were independent nations: Ethiopia (Italy tried, but failed, to colonize it in the late 19th century) and Liberia (founded as a colony for former American slaves).</p>
<p class="C423">5<span class="C349">.</span>Popular European literature with imperialist themes set in Africa included <em>Tarzan</em>, the story of a British boy raised by apes in the African jungle, and <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, a novel that criticized imperialist attitudes toward Africans.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>IMPERIALISM IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>In contrast to their experiences in Africa, Europeans found that much of Asia could not be brought into their empires. The strength of Asian governments provided enough “pushback” to keep the Europeans at bay—the Ottoman Empire still had a formidable military force; Japan was becoming one of the major powers; and Europeans desired China’s economic assets more than its land. France used a combination of military force and diplomacy to bring the Southeast Asia territory of Indo-China into its empire.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>The greatest example of European imperialism in Asia was India, Britain’s “jewel in the crown” of colonies. After the British won the Seven Years War against France in 1763, France lost control of most of its North American and South Asian holdings.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>The British seized Canada and the eastern half of the future U.S. With significant help from the British East India Company (EIC), they established rule over South Asia. By the mid-19th century, the EIC had folded, and the British government began to exert direct control over its colony in South Asia and remained the colonial power there until 1947.</p>
<p class="C423"><span id="page_89"/>4<span class="C349">.</span>The British called their rule in India the <em>raj,</em> and Queen Victoria was named Empress of India<em>.</em> In addition, during the 19th century they extended colonial control to Malaysia and Singapore. Several islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans were strategic refueling stations for British steam-powered military and cargo ships.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE U.S., GERMANY, AND JAPAN BUILD EMPIRES</strong></p>
<p class="C916">Three rising world powers in the mid-19th century had new, aggressive governments and strong national pride: the U.S., Germany, and Japan.</p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>By the end of the 19th century, along with the other imperial powers, the U.S. began acquiring islands in the Pacific for strategic refueling bases. Spain’s decline as a world power was sealed when it lost the Spanish-American War (1898–1901). As a result, the U.S. added the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico to its colonial holdings. In addition, in 1898, the U.S. annexed Hawaii with its rich sugar plantations and vital port, Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Germany was established as a country only in the late 19th century, so it merits separate discussion. German leaders were determined to become a formidable power in Europe. In that era, international respect was granted to those with the most “toys,” meaning colonies. At the Berlin Conference, Germany wrangled several African territories in strategic moves to counter British gains there. They also claimed some islands in the South Pacific.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>After changing governments in the 1860s in the Meiji Restoration, Japan was eager to join Germany and the U.S. in establishing a place with the world’s Great Powers. Japan began an aggressive campaign to create an empire in the Pacific region. Japan also wanted to counter Russian gains in East Asia. An early test of its new Western-style army was the Sino-Japanese war with China in the 1890s. Japan claimed Korea after its victory. Everyone, except Japan, was shocked when the Japanese defeated Russia in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905. The conflict was for control of territories in Manchuria and again, Korea.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong><span id="page_90"/>D.</strong></span><strong>EUROPEANS CREATED “WHITE DOMINIONS” AND “SETTLER COLONIES”</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Britain developed “White Dominions,” places where the English colonists, through disease and conquest, eventually outnumbered the native people. This occurred in Oceania (in Australia and New Zealand) and in North America in its American and Canadian colonies. “Settler colonies” were areas where Europeans settled and ruled, but remained a minority. South Africa and Singapore were two examples of British settler colonies, and the Philippines was a U.S. settler colony.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Algeria was a significant French settler colony in North Africa, where over 100,000 European colonists ruled over an Arab Muslim population of more than two million.</p>

<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span>Reactions of Africans to European imperialism ranged from warfare, to reluctant acceptance, to full cooperation. The French spent years subduing local rebellions in North Africa. The British battled Zulus and Dutch Boers in Southern Africa, and Muslims in Sudan. The Boer War left hundreds of thousands of casualties. At the end of the 19th century, descendants of Dutch settlers believed the newly arrived British were violating their property rights to land and slaves. In addition, they were angry about the gold and diamonds the British were hauling out of the territory once claimed by Boers.</p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Christian missionaries had some success spreading their faith in sub-Saharan Africa, but made no progress in the Muslim north. Europeans were determined to “civilize” the native population by dressing them in Western fashions and teaching them Western ways.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Other Africans signed treaties and acted as guides and interpreters for Europeans. Still others cooperated fully with the European powers. Often these were members of the African ruling elite families. They benefited financially and materially from working closely with the outsiders. Some were sent to Europe for full indoctrination into Western culture. After returning to their homelands, many of these elites began preparing independence movements.</p>
<p class="C423"><span id="page_91"/>3<span class="C349">.</span>Still other sub-Saharan Africans believed a spiritual movement would expel the foreigners. The Xhosa people in South Africa killed their cattle and burned their crops after a prophecy claimed that this would force the British to leave. After that, new cattle and crops would miraculously be restored to a revived Xhosa nation. Sadly, about 40,000 Xhosa people died of starvation.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>REACTIONS BY ASIANS TO IMPERIALISM</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>In Asia, the same pattern emerged as in Africa: Some local people rebelled violently, while others tried to fit in to the colonial powers’ ways of life. Military resistance to European occupation occurred in Afghanistan (against the British), the Philippines (against the U.S.) and in China, against foreigners in general. There, the Taiping and Boxer rebellions were highly anti-foreign in their nature.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>In the mid-19th century in India, the “native” army, who were employed by the British colonial government and the East India Company, rebelled. It took British and pro-British Indian forces a year to suppress them. This resulted in the end of the Mughal dynasty which had ruled India since the 16th century, the dissolution of the East India Company, and the beginnings of the British <em>raj</em> over India.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Korea fought against French and later U.S. forces who sought trade agreements like those made with Japan and China.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>There were also examples of cooperation. Many Indian soldiers remained loyal to the British in the Indian rebellion. The king of Siam (Thailand) decided to proactively deflect European colonization by inviting British representatives to help westernize his country.</p>

<p class="C916">By the end of the 1800s, even those of modest means could buy goods from around the world. This was the result of rising incomes, faster and cheaper transportation, and more efficient production methods. For example, a Brazilian could purchase clothes made of Egyptian cotton, soap made of palm oil from West Africa, wheat from the U.S., tea from Ceylon, porcelain from China, meat from Argentina, and bananas from Honduras. Transnational corporations, like Lipton Tea, owned enormous plantations in South Asia and the crops were harvested by poorly paid workers. The tea was packed into steam-powered cargo ships for global markets.</p>

<p class="C916">You already know that imperialism had its political forms, and just learned about the rapidly expanding global economy, due to the Industrial Revolution. Economic imperialism was closely connected.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>OPIUM WARS</strong></p>
<p class="C933">The most infamous example of European economic imperialism in Asia was the Opium Wars pitting Britain and France against China in the mid-19th century. To offset huge trade deficits, the British smuggled opium from the Middle East and South Asia into China’s ports, in defiance of Chinese laws. China’s diplomatic protests went unheeded and war broke out between the two nations. Soon France joined Britain’s side. China was overwhelmed and forced into a series of Unequal Treaties that increased the victors’ economic presence, including ceding Hong Kong to British authority. Other nations, including Russia, Japan, and Germany eagerly negotiated their own Unequal Treaties with China.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span>Rather than colonization, these nations created “Spheres of Influence” within China, with each foreign nation having exclusive trading rights in “its” portion of China. As noted in <a href="16_Chapter_8_Unit_5__Revolutions__c.html#page_67">Chapter 8</a>, the U.S. proposed a trading free-for-all in China, called the Open Door Policy, which was accepted by the nations involved. China had little say in the matter.</p>

</tr>
</table>
<p class="C916">In the era 1750–1900, faster transportation, an increased need for labor in the global economy, and violent unrest globally converged to create one of the greatest ages of human migration. As the Industrial Revolution spread, more people took engine-powered ships and trains to new destinations. These migrations occurred within Afro-Eurasia and within the Americas, but it was the migrations to North and South America <em>from</em> Afro-Eurasia that historians focus on in this era.</p>
<p class="C916">Migrations have two overarching causes: “push” factors that make people want to leave their home, and “pull” factors that draw them to a different location.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>PUSH FACTORS</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Population pressures. The Industrial Revolution brought new technology, new kinds of fertilizers to farms (meaning more food), and new medicines. These combined—and continue to combine—to increase populations and allow longer life spans. India, China, and Japan were demographic centers of this push factor toward the Americas and points in the Pacific region. People with the ability to do so often left these regions for less populated ones.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Faster and cheaper transportation. It wasn’t luxurious, but reliable steamship transportation across the oceans was cheap enough for most—provided they could reach a port city.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Political unrest and religious persecution. The revolutions throughout the world in the 19th century caused political instability and were a major push factor for migrants to leave their homelands. An additional push factor was religious persecutions, such as the anti-Jewish pogroms in Russia.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>Famine. Along with the Irish famine of the mid-19th century, other famines pushed people away from East and South Asia.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong><span id="page_94"/>B.</strong></span><strong>PULL FACTORS</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Urbanization. Migrants gravitated to cities with people of the same heritage. Italian, Jewish, German, and Chinese neighborhoods developed. In addition, more government services were offered to migrants in cities than in rural areas.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Farmland. The U.S., Canada, Russia, and many Latin American nations encouraged immigration with generous land policies. For example, the U.S. offered 160 acres of farmland in the Western Great Plains to settlers who worked their tract of land for five years.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Abolition of slavery. The end of slavery in the Western world by the late 19th century did not end the need for agricultural labor. Indentured labor, a situation in which one signs on to be—for all intents and purposes—a “temporary slave,” with release from obligation after a period—from 5 to 10 years—was a strong pull factor for migrants from South and East Asia. Indentured servants worked on sugar plantations in the Caribbean into the 1920s, and were a significant source of labor on islands in the Indian Ocean and in South Africa.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>Economic opportunity. Many nations, especially in the Americas, offered opportunities for economic advancement that were impossible elsewhere. Discoveries of gold in Australia, Alaska, and northwest Canada triggered “rushes” of migrants into those areas.</p>
<p class="C423">5<span class="C349">.</span>Political and religious freedom. Pushed out by revolutions and persecutions, migrants sought new lands hoping for greater political participation and religious tolerance. Many Southern Europeans and Germans migrated to South and North America, while migrants from North Africa sought opportunities in Europe.</p>

In Africa, European powers promoted large-scale, single-crop farming for export.

<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Women coped by taking on responsibilities that had once been primarily “man’s work,” such as trade, growing crops for home use, and mining.</p>
