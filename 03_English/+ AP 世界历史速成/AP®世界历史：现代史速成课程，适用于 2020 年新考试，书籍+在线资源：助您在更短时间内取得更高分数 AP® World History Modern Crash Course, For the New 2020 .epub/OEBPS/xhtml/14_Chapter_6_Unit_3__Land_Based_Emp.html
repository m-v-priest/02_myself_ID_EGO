<p class="C1189"><strong>Land-Based Empires</strong></p>
<p class="C1191"><strong>c. 1450 to c. 1750</strong></p>
<p class="C398">Many students think of the era c. 1450–c. 1750 as when “Columbus sailed the ocean blue” and brought the Americas into contact with Europe. Although true, the AP® World History: Modern course also discusses empires that expanded without sailing to the New World. This chapter examines features of Afro-Eurasian empires that were land-based, that is, they expanded across vast areas of forests, deserts, and grasslands. In East Asia, the Ming Dynasty in China was replaced by outsiders, the Manchu, who expanded their borders. The Ottoman Empire had been expanding since the 13th century and continued to do so into this era. The Mughals spread into South and Central Asia. Russia, which was centered in Eastern Europe, added thousands of miles of land in Asia to its empire. The Persian Safavid Empire clashed with the Ottomans and Mughals as they tried to stretch their borders.</p>

<p class="C916">Land-based empires used the Chinese innovation of gunpowder with military forces to expand, so some historians label them “gunpowder empires.”</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span>In China, the once-powerful Ming Dynasty weakened and was replaced by the Manchu (Qing) Dynasty, 1644–1912. The Manchus came from north of China, namely, Manchuria. They remained a minority ethnic group in the land they ruled, and adopted the Chinese language, Confucian philosophy, the Chinese bureaucracy, and continued the ancient concept of the Mandate of Heaven, which justified the rule of an emperor as long as he led the people correctly.</p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Because they were a minority in China and outsiders, the Qing rewarded ethnic Chinese soldiers and generals who supported <span id="page_48"/>their rule. They also allowed local Chinese rulers to keep their status, as long as they obeyed Qing policies.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>The Qing were also tolerant of local faiths and customs.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE WAS ESTABLISHED IN ANATOLIA (TURKEY) AT THE END OF THE 13th CENTURY</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The Ottoman Empire reached its peak of power during this era. The empire stretched across North Africa into Southwest Asia and north into modern Turkey, reaching almost to modern Austria. The Ottomans defeated what was left of the Byzantine Empire when they took Constantinople in 1453, renamed it Istanbul, and continued westward into Eastern Europe. Geographically and culturally it was a bridge between Europe, Africa, and Asia, encompassing Christian, Jewish, and Muslim faiths.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>The Ottomans reached the limit of their expansion into Europe by failing to conquer Vienna, Austria, in the early 16th century and again in the late 17th century. Like Russia, the Ottoman Empire struggled with its political identity as part-Asian and part-European. Despite its history of battles with Christian Europe, it wanted to be part of the European diplomatic sphere.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Many Western Christians believed Muslims wanted to conquer all of Europe, especially after the Ottomans seized Constantinople in 1453.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>This concern for the fate of Christianity was a motivation in spreading the faith to the Americas after Columbus’s discoveries.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>Another factor was the European fear that trade routes through Constantinople would be cut off by the Ottomans. Thus, the search for alternate routes to the “East” began.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH ASIA IN THE EARLY 16th CENTURY, MUSLIMS FROM CENTRAL ASIA ESTABLISHED THE MUGHAL EMPIRE</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The Mughal claimed to be descended from the Mongol ruler Chinggis Khan (“Mughal” comes from the word “Mongol”).</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Rare in Indian history, most of South Asia was united under a single government—for a while.</p>
<p class="C423"><span id="page_49"/>3<span class="C349">.</span>The Mughal’s greatest ruler was Akbar in the 16th century. His main legacy was extending religious toleration to the 75% of the population that was Hindu.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>Like the Ottomans, the Mughals were Muslim rulers of an empire. Unlike the Ottomans, the Mughals’ faith was in the minority in their own empire. One of the world’s most iconic buildings, the Taj Mahal, was built by a Muslim in the heart of Hindu territory.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>RUSSIA BUILT THE LARGEST LAND EMPIRE OF THIS ERA, FIRST TO THE EAST ACROSS SIBERIA, THEN TO THE SOUTH AND WEST</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Russia’s entry into world affairs began with Ivan the Great, who expelled the last of the Mongol rulers in the late 15th century.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>In the 16th century, Ivan the Terrible began a conquest of Siberia that continued for one hundred years.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>In the early 18th century, Peter the Great fought the Ottoman, Safavid, and Swedish empires for territories.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>Russian migrants flocked to these areas, greatly changing the cultural make-up of these regions.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>Like China, Russia generally maintained a policy of religious toleration in the regions it conquered—except for Jews.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>Starting in the late 17th century and continuing through the late 18th century, Peter the Great and, later, Catherine the Great pushed a modernization program in Russia to bring their nation closer to the level of Western European technology and culture. This included moving the capital from Moscow to St. Petersburg, the “window on the West.”</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>SAFAVID EMPIRE</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The Safavid Empire in Persia (modern Iran) in the early 16th century sought to expand its borders by waging war with the Ottomans to the west and with the Mughals to the east.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Although all three of the bordering states were primarily Muslim, rivalries between factions within Islam was a significant cause of these wars.</p>

<p class="C916">Every government uses people, money, symbols, and traditions to gain and maintain power.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>USING ADMINISTRATIVE PROFESSIONALS TO RUN THE EMPIRE</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Historically, rulers have used various methods to retain power. The Ottoman Empire began in the 13th century and expanded dramatically in this era.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>Although its Muslim leaders did not require Christians and Jews to convert to Islam, they did demand that boys in non-Muslim families in Southern Europe become soldiers.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>“Recruits” were known as <em>Janissaries</em> and their “recruitment” was called the <em>devshirme</em> system. Janissaries were trained in Islam and although they were not Turks, they could be promoted by showing loyalty and ability—and many did. Sometimes the hope of upward mobility was so strong that Christian parents volunteered their sons for Janissary duty.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>In Japan, the Tokugawa Shogunate elevated many <em>samurai</em> (feudal knights) to administrative positions in the government. Many <em>samurai</em> became artists, scholars, and poets.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>USING RELIGION, ART, AND ARCHITECTURE TO MAINTAIN POWER</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The Mexica (Aztec) practiced human sacrifice to appease the gods and their god/king in power.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>European monarchs claimed the “divine right” to legitimize their power. This meant the kings believed God was on their side, so if you opposed the king, you opposed God.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>The Songhai rulers in West Africa, the Ottomans, the Mughals and the Safavids openly practiced and promoted Islam.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>Many monarchs around the globe commissioned (paid for) portraits of themselves, usually wearing royal robes and surrounded with other symbols of power.</p>
<p class="C423">5<span class="C349">.</span>The Inca built the famous Temple of the Sun as a monument to their religion and their king’s power.</p>
<p class="C423"><span id="page_51"/>6<span class="C349">.</span>Monarchs impressed their rivals and supporters with large, expensive palaces like Versailles in France, the Forbidden City in China, and mausoleums like the Taj Mahal in South Asia.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>USING TAXES TO MAINTAIN AND BUILD POWER</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Governments used taxes to raise operating funds for thousands of years.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>Almost any commodity was taxed: land, animals, goods, and imports.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>Taxes reduced the economic power of those being taxed.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C435">iii.</span>“Tax farming” was used by many governments.</p>
<p class="C468"><span class="C391"><img alt="" src="../img/51_1.jpg" style="width:3.5%;display:inline;vertical-align:middle;"/></span>Tax farming used local tax collectors to extract money from individuals.</p>
<p class="C468"><span class="C391"><img alt="" src="../img/51_1.jpg" style="width:3.5%;display:inline;vertical-align:middle;"/></span>The Safavids and Ottomans were two examples of governments who practiced tax farming.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C340">iv.</span>Some governments, like the Mughal, recognized local elites, called zamindars, as rent collectors of farmers. In exchange for this right to collect rent, the Mughal required their part.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C349">v.</span>Imported goods (“tariffs”) were taxed by almost every government.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Inca leaders required farmers to bring their produce to central locations, where government administrators redistributed crops and animals to the rest of the people, especially those in favor.</p>

<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>In 16th century Central Europe, a reform movement that protested abuses by the Roman Catholic church hierarchy swept across the continent.</p>
<p class="C430"><span id="page_52"/><span class="C391"><span class="C391">i.</span></span>The Protestant Reformation created a major shake-up of Catholic authority, especially in Northern Europe.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>Large European states like Britain and Sweden, and smaller ones within the Holy Roman Empire adopted Protestantism as their official religion.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>The Roman Catholic church responded with reforms of its own, and maintained its dominance in Southern Europe, and most of Western Europe, and Poland.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>In Spain especially, spreading the Catholic faith was a major factor in sending voyages to the New World. Missionaries, including Jesuits, were part of these expeditions.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>In Islam, an old division intensified—</p>
