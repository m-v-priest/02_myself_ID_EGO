<p class="C695"><strong>Tips for Writing the Long Essay</strong></p>
<p class="C681">Like in the DBQ the types of long essays you will see on the AP® World History: Modern exam include: Comparison (similarities and differences), Causation (cause and/or effect), and Continuity and Change Over Time.</p>
<p class="C681">You will be given three long-essay prompts, <em>but choose only one essay topic</em>. Instructions will tell you to pick <em>one</em> long essay prompt from 1200 to 1750, <em>or</em> 1450 to 1900, <em>or</em> 1750 to 2001.</p>
<p class="P260">The long essay is graded on a 6-point scale. You are allotted 40 minutes to prepare and write it, for 15% of your overall grade. Here are the basic rubric points for the long essay:</p>
<p class="C390"><span class="C391"><img alt="" src="../img/51_1.jpg" style="width:3.5%;display:inline;vertical-align:middle;"/></span><strong>Thesis/Claim (1 point):</strong> Present a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim or that establishes a line of reasoning, responding to all parts of the question. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion.</p>
<p class="C390"><span class="C391"><img alt="" src="../img/51_1.jpg" style="width:3.5%;display:inline;vertical-align:middle;"/></span><strong>Contextualization (1 point):</strong> Describe a broader historical context relevant to the prompt.</p>
<p class="C390"><span class="C391"><img alt="" src="../img/51_1.jpg" style="width:3.5%;display:inline;vertical-align:middle;"/></span><strong>Evidence (1 or 2 points):</strong> Support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant examples.</p>
<p class="C390"><span class="C391"><img alt="" src="../img/51_1.jpg" style="width:3.5%;display:inline;vertical-align:middle;"/></span><strong>Analysis and Reasoning (1 or 2 points):</strong> Demonstrate a complex understanding of the historical development in the prompt to support, qualify, or modify an argument.</p>
<p class="C681">All AP® World History: Modern long essays are <strong>argumentative</strong> because you must take a stand based on the prompt (“a historically defensible claim”) and provide evidence and arguments to support your stand. For example, a prompt could read:</p>
<p class="C997">“Evaluate the extent to which new technology influenced change in Africa in the era c. 1750–c. 1900.”</p>
<p class="C681"><span id="page_186"/>A successful essay could argue that technology fostered a lot of change (“a lot of” being a minimal “extent-to-which” argument) in c. 1750–c. 1900, but you must also provide examples of things that didn’t change despite technology (“On the other hand, not everything changed in Africa in this era because of new technology. For example . . . ”) That “extent to which” business in the prompt is telling you to pick a side to argue, but to earn full credit, you must discuss and analyze the opposite argument as well.</p>
<p class="P261">The side you pick isn’t crucial as long as you can support your argument with facts and analysis. The goal is to show complexity in your thinking, and not write about history being all one way or the other.</p>
<p class="P262">Students often ask, “How many specific pieces of evidence must I offer?” The answer is: as many as you can think of.</p>
<p class="C681">AP® history is not about how little you can do to get credit. AP® history is about showing how much you know. If some of your “evidence” is wrong, graders don’t count points off. They only score what you get right. So load up on evidence!</p>
<p class="C681">Avoid extreme terms like “everyone,” “always,” “all,” “nobody,” “never,” and “none.” Instead, use qualified words such as “most,” “usually,” “sometimes,” “rarely,” and “a few.” For example, “Everything in Africa changed because of new technology.” Really? You know for a fact that every . . . single . . . thing in Africa changed because of trains and new medicine? Of course not. That’s why, “Many things in Africa changed after the introduction of new technology in the era 1750–1900,” is a more defensible argument.</p>
<p class="C681">The next section includes “how to” guides for success on the AP® World History: Modern long essay question. Walk through them one at a time to get comfortable with the requirements for the different types of long essays.</p>
<p class="C307"><strong>“HOW TO” GUIDES FOR SUCCESS ON THE LONG ESSAY</strong></p>
<p class="C894"><img alt="" class="width_25" src="../img/45_1.jpg"/></p>
<div class="C903">
<p class="C1142"><em><strong>Important! You must adapt these suggestions to fit the terms of the question.</strong></em></p>
</div>
<p class="C344"><strong>1<span class="C349">.</span>The Comparison Long Essay</strong></p>
<p class="C1096">This sample essay prompt echoes the one from the beginning of <a href="30_Chapter_20_Mastering_the_Documen.html#page_177">Chapter 20</a>: “Analyze the extent to which Japanese and Chinese <span id="page_187"/>responses to Western influences in the 19th century were similar.”</p>
<p class="C1096">One approach is to develop an argument that Japan and China were mostly different in their responses to western influences by 1900. For example, Japan adopted a Western-style constitutional monarchy and China did not. However, there were some similarities, such as both tried to maintain their independence from Western colonialism.</p>
<p class="C1096">You don’t “have to” have paragraphs, but the exam grader will be grateful for them.</p>
<p class="C1096"><strong>Paragraph 1 Thesis</strong>: “There were more similarities but some differences in (name the two things/eras/events being compared). For example, there were similarities in (provide two examples). However, there were also some differences in . . . .” .</p>
<p class="C1096">Example thesis: There were more differences than similarities in how Japan and China responded to 19th century western influences. Japan brought in the Industrial Revolution and a constitutional monarchy while China mostly resisted Westernization. However, both countries sent people to the West to learn their ways.”</p>
<p class="C1096"><strong>Paragraph 2:</strong> Put the question in historical <strong>context</strong>. What was happening in this question’s world that brought us to this question.</p>
<p class="C1096">Example context: “European countries and the U.S. were growing in power in the 19th century because of new industrial might. Competition for markets around the world fed a spirit of imperialism. Japan and China were targets of western economic and political interests and they responded to these new potential threats.”</p>
<p class="C1096"><strong>Paragraph 3: Evidence with analysis</strong></p>
<p class="C1096">Topic sentence: “There were more differences than similarities in how Japan and China responded to Westernization.”</p>
<p class="C1096">Provide examples of differences: Japan yielded to the Western powers and China resisted by fighting the Opium wars to stop British influence. Japan began the Meiji Restoration, a Western-style government while China stuck with their ancient system. Japan began a fast-paced Industrial Revolution but China was slow to industrialize. (These are just some examples, I bet you have more.)</p>
<p class="C1096">Next, analyze <em>why</em> they responded differently:</p>
<p class="C1096">“Japan saw how China fought Britain and lost, so they decided it was better to switch than fight. China was the greatest economic power in the world in 1800, so they believed they could push back against <span id="page_188"/>the latest threat and win, but by 1900, it was too late.” (These are just some examples; I bet you have more.)</p>
<p class="C1096"><strong>Paragraph 4: Evidence with analysis</strong></p>
<p class="C1096">Topic sentence: “On the other hand, there were some similarities in how Japan and China responded to Westernization by 1900.”</p>
<p class="C1096">Evidence: “For example, both countries sent people to the West to learn about them. Japan and China hired foreign experts to help modernize their militaries, and both faced opposition inside their countries to their government’s official policies on Westernization.”</p>
<p class="C1096">Next, analyze <em>why</em> they responded similarly:</p>
<p class="C1096">“Japan and China sent people to the West because they figured the best way to deal with an outside threat was to study them. They hired foreign military experts because Europe and the U.S. had more modern weapons, and these Asian countries wanted to be stronger.”</p>
<p class="C1096"><strong>Paragraph 5: Conclusion</strong></p>
<p class="C1096">A conclusion isn’t mandatory, but it’s a good idea to reword your thesis here, just in case the one at the start of your essay isn’t quite enough to earn the point. Scoring: Thesis (1), Context (1), Lots of specific evidence that responds to the prompt (2), Complex argument (2)—explains the significance of the evidence and argues both sides of the question.</p>
<p class="C344"><strong>2<span class="C349">.</span>The Causation Long Essay (causes and/or effects of an event or movement, for example)</strong></p>
<p class="C1096">Let’s look at the causation prompt near the beginning of <a href="30_Chapter_20_Mastering_the_Documen.html#page_177">Chapter 20</a>:</p>
<p class="C1096">“To what extent did the Industrial Revolution contribute to the high casualties in World War I?”</p>
<p class="C1096"><strong>Paragraph 1 Thesis</strong>: “There were many causes (or effects) of (name the event). Perhaps the most important causes (or effects) were ____ and _____ because of their great effects on history. However, other factors were also causes, such as _____________.”</p>
<p class="C1096">Example: “To a great extent, technology from the Industrial Revolution like the machine gun and submarines caused high casualties in WWI. However, the refusal by the leaders on all sides to negotiate a peace early in the war also led to a long and bloody war.”</p>
<p class="C1096"><strong><span id="page_189"/>Paragraph 2: Context.</strong> Define the event and put it in historical context. What was happening in this question’s world? Example: “World War I began because of 50 years of competition among the Great Powers of Europe for land and resources around the world. This led to secret alliances and huge military build-ups, which increased tensions to the breaking point by the early 20th century. The killing of the Archduke of Austria-Hungary led to a chain of events that nobody seemed to want to stop.”</p>
<p class="C1096"><strong>Paragraph 3</strong>: <strong>Evidence with analysis.</strong> Discuss as many specific causes and/or effects (depending on the question) of the event as you can think of. Name the <em>most</em> significant cause (or effect) and tell <em>why</em> it is significant.</p>
<p class="C1096">Topic sentence: “The greatest reason why WWI was so deadly was the new weapons that came out of the Industrial Revolution.”</p>
<p class="C1096">Evidence: Discuss the effects of the machine gun, submarine, poison gas, long-range cannon, the airplane, the tank . . . you get the point.</p>
<p class="C1096">Next, analyze <em>why</em> these new weapons were so deadly: “The machine gun shot so fast that men had no chance against them. The generals kept using old tactics of marching men in straight lines across the battlefield, and they were slaughtered every time.” I bet you have more examples.</p>
<p class="C1096"><strong>Paragraph 4: Evidence with analysis</strong></p>
<p class="C1096">Topic sentence: “On the other hand, some of the high casualties were not due just to new weapons from the Industrial Revolution.”</p>
<p class="C1096">Evidence: “Secret treaties from before the war and the stubborn refusal of the nations to end it before it got way out of hand were other reasons why it got so bad.“ I bet you can think of more reasons, like national pride.</p>
<p class="C1096">Next analyze <em>why</em> the nations refused to negotiate a quick end to the war: “Due to imperial rivalries in Africa between Germany, Britain, France, and suspicions between the Kaiser of Germany and the Czar of Russia, nobody was interested in talking peace until millions had died.”</p>
<p class="C1096"><strong>Paragraph 5 Conclusion</strong>. A conclusion isn’t mandatory, but it’s a good idea to reword your thesis here, just in case the one at the start of your essay isn’t quite enough to earn the point.</p>
<p class="C1096"><span id="page_190"/>Scoring: Thesis (1), Context (1), Lots of specific Evidence that responds to the prompt (2), Complex argument (2)—explains the significance of the evidence and argues both sides of the question.</p>
<p class="C344"><strong>3<span class="C349">.</span>The Continuity and Change Over Time Long Essay</strong></p>
<p class="C1096">It is important to address the time period named in the CCOT prompt. Otherwise, how can you show change over time without naming the time?</p>
<p class="C1096">Here is the CCOT prompt found at the beginning of <a href="30_Chapter_20_Mastering_the_Documen.html#page_177">Chapter 20</a>:</p>
<p class="C924">“Evaluate the extent of change in religious traditions in the Americas from c. 1500 to c. 1750.”</p>
<p class="C1096">A strong response would develop an essay that argued that there was much change in religious traditions in the Americas after the introduction of Christianity by Europeans, but that some continuities remained, such as the blending of some indigenous African religious practices with Christianity to form Vodun (“Voodoo”).</p>
<p class="C1096"><strong>Paragraph 1: Thesis.</strong> “There were many continuities and some changes (or, more changes than continuities if that works for you) in (insert the time and topic of the question). Provide some specific examples of both continuity and change in your thesis.”</p>
<p class="C1096">Example: “There was a great deal of change in religious traditions in the Americas from c. 1500 through c. 1750, like a shift to monotheism after Christianity was introduced from Europe; however, some traditions continued, like the secret worship of the old gods.”</p>
<p class="C1096"><strong>Paragraph 2: Context.</strong> Define the topic and put it in historical <strong>context</strong>. What was happening elsewhere in the world at this time?</p>
<p class="C1096">Example: “Throughout history, religions have spread and as they often did, they changed to fit local traditions. When Islam moved into South Asia, it accommodated the large majority of Hindus by making them “the people of the Book.” Changes to religion also occurred in the Americas with the arrival of Christian conquistadors.”</p>
<p class="C1096"><strong>Paragraph 3: Evidence with analysis.</strong> Discuss as many specific examples of changes (or continuities) during the time period and topic of the question as you can come up with.</p>
<p class="C1096">Topic sentence: “There were many changes in the religious traditions in the Americas after the arrival of the Europeans c. 1500.”</p>
<p class="C1096"><span id="page_191"/>Examples: Shift from polytheism to monotheism through the introduction of Christianity by European missionaries, a loss of influence of the indigenous priests, the removal of Aztec and Inca kings as gods. (I bet you can think of more.)</p>
<p class="C1096">Next, analyze <em>why</em> these changes occurred: As Native Americans began to die in large numbers, their old ways died too; the Spanish and Portuguese had a strong missionary desire to convert the natives to their faith; it made good sense for the overwhelmed natives to convert to the faith of the dominant European outsiders. (I bet you can think of more.)</p>
<p class="C1096"><strong>Paragraph 4: Evidence with analysis.</strong> Now discuss some specific examples of the other side of the argument. If you choose changes in paragraph 3, then write about continuities in paragraph 4. Continuities do not have to cover the entire era, just most of it. But you have to state that in your essay: “For most of this era this stayed the same, but it changed when . . . .”</p>
<p class="C1096">Topic sentence: “However, some religious traditions in the Americas continued.”</p>
<p class="C1096">Examples: In Latin America, the Virgin of Guadalupe incorporated elements of the Aztec religion into Catholicism. In the Caribbean, African immigrants blended their culture’s faith with Catholicism to form Vodun.</p>
<p class="C1096">Next, analyze <em>why</em> these beliefs remained: “This happened because it is very difficult for people to completely abandon long-held beliefs. In Latin America, many Christian missionaries looked the other way when they saw natives practicing their old ways because it was just too hard to police everybody.”</p>
<p class="C1096"><strong>Paragraph 5: Conclusion.</strong> A conclusion isn’t mandatory, but it’s wise to reword your thesis here, just in case the one at the beginning of your essay isn’t strong enough to earn the point. Scoring: Thesis (1), Context (1), Lots of specific Evidence that responds to the prompt (2), Complex argument (2)—explains the significance of the evidence and argues both sides of the question.</p>
