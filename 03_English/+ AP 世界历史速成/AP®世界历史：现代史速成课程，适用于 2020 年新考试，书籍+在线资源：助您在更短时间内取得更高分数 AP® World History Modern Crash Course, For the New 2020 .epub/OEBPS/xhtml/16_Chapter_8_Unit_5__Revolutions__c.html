<p class="C1191"><strong>c. 1750 to c. 1900</strong></p>
<p class="C916">There were many types of revolutions in the era c. 1750–c. 1900: political, intellectual, and industrial, for starters. Ideas from European-based Enlightenment philosophies sparked revolutionary ideas founded on concepts of liberty and equality that remain vital today.</p>

<p class="C916">The Enlightenment was an era of new ideas in Western thought about approaches to religion, art, government, science, and philosophy. The movement peaked in the 18th century in Europe, but because its culture spread globally during the Age of Imperialism (see <a href="17_Chapter_9_Unit_6__Consequences_o.html#page_85">Chapter 9</a>), Enlightenment ideas did too.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>ENLIGHTENMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C924">Concepts from the Scientific Revolution (see <a href="15_Chapter_7_Unit_4__Transoceanic_I.html#page_53">Chapter 7</a>) sparked European intellectuals to think that the human condition could be explained and improved if scientifically-based rational thought governed everyday life. Applied to politics, such ideals were labelled “classical liberalism.” For example:</p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span><strong>Individual equality.</strong> Enlightenment thinkers (<em>philosophes</em>, French for “philosophers”), such as the French writers Voltaire and Rousseau, advocated that all men were created equal—that no person deserved extra privileges over others just for being born. A king was not automatically “better” than a commoner. The U.S. Declaration of Independence reflects this belief.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span><strong>Individual liberty.</strong> This Enlightenment ideal says people should be free to make their own personal and economic decisions in life. Freedom of speech and religion were “natural rights” <span id="page_68"/>given by God, not man. Slavery should be abolished. Women should be treated as political equals to men. Famous European writers promoting women’s rights were Mary Wollstonecraft (<em>A Vindication of the Rights of Women</em>) and Olympe de Gouges (<em>Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen</em>).</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span><strong>Limited governments.</strong> Enlightenment thinkers Locke and Rousseau wrote that governments and the people had a “social contract” between them. If the leader of the government failed to serve the people well, the people had a right to revolt. Favored forms of government among Enlightenment thinkers included a constitution, freedom of thought, and divided powers between a king and a legislature. Other philosophes favored these ideas, but without a king. They sought a government led by a leader elected by popular vote.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>NATIONALISM</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Nationalism arose from Enlightenment thought about personal liberties and choices. It inspired many to call for the creation of new nations out of large empires.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span><em>Nationalism</em> is defined as a sense of strong identity with others who share a common history, customs, religion, and/or language. This concept was a major factor in the independence movements in Latin America and Europe in the 19th century, and colonies worldwide in the 20th century.</p>

<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>AMERICAN REVOLUTION</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The first place these ideas about revolution were tried on a large scale was in the British colonies in America.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>The Declaration of Independence spelled out Enlightenment ideas of “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” In the context of World History, the effects of the American Revolution were enormous.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>The notion that a group of colonies could overthrow a European power and establish—on purpose, no less—a <span id="page_69"/>representative government based on Enlightenment principles, inspired revolutions around the world into the 21st century.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>FRENCH REVOLUTION AND AFTERMATH</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>In 1789, the French revolted against their king, Louis XVI, but unlike the American Revolution, the struggle was not with a colony but in the home country. In the spirit of Enlightenment ideas, the slogan of the French Revolution was, “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity (brotherhood).” The French Revolution expressed its roots in the Enlightenment in the civil rights document, “Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen.”</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>After failing to create a limited constitutional monarchy similar to Britain’s, French leaders established a republic. But they insisted on radically reshaping political and cultural traditions to fit their goals.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>The French Republic was overthrown by Napoleon Bonaparte, a military dictator who restored order. Claiming to be a “child of the Enlightenment,” he did enact reforms, such as equality, before the law. But he was no supporter of republican government. After Napoleon’s defeat by a coalition of other European nations, European boundaries were reorganized which added new nations such as a new version of the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>HAITI AND LATIN AMERICA</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C340">.</span>Haiti</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>The French Revolution’s first “child” was delivered in the early 19th century in its colony of Haiti, then known as Saint-Domingue. The vast majority of the residents were slaves. Led by Toussaint L’Ouverture, they revolted against their white French masters. An army sent by Napoleon to quell the rebellion was defeated.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>The result of this first successful slave revolt was the establishment of the second republic in the New World, after the U.S.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C435">iii.</span>In its revolution, Haiti’s rich plantation economy of large exportable crops of sugar and coffee was destroyed and replaced by small farms that exported very little.</p>

</div>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Latin America</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>By 1830, the successful Haitian revolution inspired the rest of Latin America’s colonies to rise against Spanish and Portuguese rule. Led by upper class “Creole elites”—most famously Simón Bolívar—one by one the colonies gained independence through military victories against the colonizers, hastening the decline of Spain as a world power. Bolívar wrote a Latin American “Declaration of Independence” known as “The Jamaica Letter.”</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>Unlike the U.S., which had a sizable educated middle class, in Latin America there was an enormous social and economic chasm between the few elite and the many poor. Similar to the U.S. experience, the elite remained in power after the revolutions. Establishing stable governments proved difficult in the new Latin American nations, including Mexico and Brazil, as was a lack of significant social and economic change for the non-elites.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C435">iii.</span>Although women’s rights were frequently discussed by the European philosophes, in Latin America and elsewhere, they were largely set aside until the 20th century.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>“EUROPE IN FLAMES”</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The nationalist revolutions in Latin America expelled the colonial powers. These successes inspired Europeans to use nationalism to replace governments thought to be “outside oppressors.” Greece broke away from the Ottoman Empire (1820). But in the vast Austrian empire, Poles, Italians, and Slavs, failed to break away and form their own nations in the early 19th century. In 1848, so many nations experienced violence—in some cases civil war—that the phrase “Europe in flames” became popular. In the 1860s and 1870s, two new nations emerged, both forged with strong nationalist fervor: Italy and Germany.</p>
<p class="C423"><span id="page_71"/>2<span class="C349">.</span>In 1830 and 1848, dissatisfied French rebels overthrew their governments. In the second of these revolutions, France established another short-lived republic.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>In Russia in the 1820s, a military coup promising a constitutional monarchy failed miserably, but inspired future revolutionaries there.</p>

<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>HISTORIC IMPACT</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>In the era c. 1750–c. 1900, the greatest revolution since the Neolithic era (c. 8000 <small>BCE</small>) occurred: the Industrial Revolution. It fundamentally changed the human experience and continues to affect the world today. Although some people in the early 21st century have not experienced industrialization directly, only a miniscule number can be said to be unaffected by it.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>The Industrial Revolution changed governments, family life, global and local economies, food production, migration, war, art and literature, the environment, transportation, communication, population growth, and rural and urban areas. It led to the Age of Imperialism, political revolutions, communism, World War I, women’s rights, multinational corporations, and the “traditional” Western family.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>CAUSES OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION</strong></p>
<p class="C926">Why did the Industrial Revolution begin in Western Europe, and why specifically in Britain? Several factors contributed.</p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Government policies—As noted in previous chapters, Western Europe built political and economic empires in the New World. The flow of silver and gold from the New World into Europe’s treasuries made their societies the richest in the world. European governments—especially Britain—invested part of this income in the form of monetary prizes to individuals who invented more efficient ways to transport goods, grow crops, defeat enemies—anything that might significantly contribute to growing the nation’s slice of the global mercantilist pie. (<a href="15_Chapter_7_Unit_4__Transoceanic_I.html#page_53">See Chapter 7</a>.)</p>
<p class="C423"><span id="page_72"/>2<span class="C349">.</span>Geography—A major environmental cause was selecting the right type of natural resources to create the inventions.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>Britain had coal, timber, and iron, rich soil, fast-moving rivers to turn waterwheels that powered machines, and many natural harbors to import raw materials from faraway colonies. Products manufactured from those raw materials were exported back to millions of colonial consumers and other markets around the globe.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>Belgium, Germany, and France had similar favorable geographic conditions and were quick to follow Britain’s lead in developing industry.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Economic and Social Mobility</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>In Britain, and to a lesser degree in the rest of Western Europe, citizens could move up the economic and social ladder by developing a money-making invention. This incentive spurred Britain to become “a nation of tinkerers,” as one observer put it. Banks loaned money to entrepreneurs in whom they had faith.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>European governments offered prizes for inventions that they considered helpful to their global economic and political goals. These conditions did not exist outside Europe at the beginning of this era.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>Workforce</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>Britain had many workers skilled in operating metal tools. Those skills were necessary for the creation of the machines that would be used to develop its industry.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>Many British agricultural workers were forced off farmland by a government-approved policy called the Enclosure Movement. The landless peasants migrated to cities, forming a large potential workforce for factories.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>BEGINNINGS OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Mechanization of Textile Production</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>British inventors developed machines that mass-produced cloth and thread. These muscle-powered wood-and-iron machines cranked out cloth faster and cheaper than handmade materials.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441"><span id="page_73"/><span class="C441">ii.</span></span>Bigger and quicker machines were developed and amassed into large buildings called factories. Waterwheels rotating in fast-moving streams provided power for the machines.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Uses of steam engine</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>By the 1760s, British inventors had developed the steam engine—one of the most revolutionary inventions of all time—and made water power obsolete. No longer did factories have to be anchored next to a stream; they could be located anywhere.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>Connecting cloth- and thread-making machines to steam engines increased production many times beyond what humans could do. Mass production of goods made machine-made clothing affordable to just about all Europeans.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>More inventions.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>The cotton gin removed seeds from cotton to prepare it for thread and cloth manufacturing. It operated many times faster than any human and when hooked to a steam engine, even faster.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>Two early 19th-century inventions involving the steam engine drastically altered transportation. In the U.S., the first steamboat made sail power obsolete. In Britain, the steam-powered locomotives on railroads marked the beginning of the end of the age of the horse in modern societies.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C435">iii.</span>The steamboat created more reliable, faster, and cheaper transoceanic travel. This caused a huge increase in the numbers of people migrating from one region to another, most significantly from Europe to the Americas.</p>

<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>UNITED STATES</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Thanks to the cotton gin, single-crop plantations in the South became highly profitable.</p>
<p class="C423"><span id="page_74"/>2<span class="C349">.</span>British-style factories that turned American cotton into textiles popped up in the Northeast. The South produced so much cotton that the surplus was sold to British factories. Slavery was abolished after the U.S. Civil War giving the industrial North an even bigger economic boost over the South.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Railroads sprang up, first in the Northeast, and soon connected to farming areas in the Midwest and South, speeding delivery of crops and farm animals to processing factories in Chicago and other Northern cities.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>By 1900, the U.S. was the world’s biggest steel producer. U.S. Steel Corporation became the first billion-dollar corporation.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>LATIN AMERICA</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Europeans invested heavily to jump-start industrialization in Latin America. Great expectations followed and some railroad routes were built, but overall, like Russia, Latin America remained largely an exporter of crops grown by peasant labor. Among their products were coffee, bananas, wheat, beef, and sugar. Industrialized nations sought Mexican copper.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>INDIA</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Britain established its rule (<em>raj</em>) over India early in the era c. 1750–c.1900.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>India was a leading grower of cotton, and Britain eagerly imported the processed fabric for its textile mills. Under British authority, Indian textile factories began to produce machine-made cotton thread and cloth, and the production of handmade textiles began to decline.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>India’s age of rapid industrial growth, however, languished until the late 20th century.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>INDUSTRIALIZATION IN OTHER REGIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The Ottoman Empire was slow in developing modern industries. Its leaders failed to recognize the extent to which industrialization was increasing the West’s political, economic, and military power. Unlike the Japanese, the Ottoman leadership was divided over following Western Europe’s industrial model.</p>
<p class="C423"><span id="page_75"/>2<span class="C349">.</span>Africa remained a provider of natural resources to the world’s industrial giants.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>The greatest export in terms of value were diamonds and gold from South Africa.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>In the Age of Imperialism (see <a href="17_Chapter_9_Unit_6__Consequences_o.html#page_85">Chapter 9</a>), Europe’s governments and businesses kept its African colonies dependent on them.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>China rejected Western ideas in this era and remained largely out of the production end of the Industrial Revolution. Some foreign investment provided for railroads and steamships, but overall, the Middle Kingdom stuck with human labor to produce crops and hand-made items for export.</p>

<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Coal was the initial fuel for the early steam engines, but as the 19th century progressed, petroleum was increasingly used, especially after the development of the internal combustion (diesel and later, gasoline) engine. Both provided vastly greater amounts of energy than any previous form of power.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>STEEL BECOMES THE “KING OF METALS”</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Advancements in steel processing led to mass production of this alloy that was stronger, lighter, and more flexible than iron. Factories were built in regions near iron and coal mines, materials vital to steel production. Western Europe again led the way, soon followed by the U.S., Japan, and Russia. Steel became <em>the</em> metal of the Industrial Age.</p>
<p class="C423"><span class="C349"><strong><span id="page_76"/>C.</strong></span><strong>THE “SECOND INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION”</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The pace of industrialization quickened and so did the number of inventions in the second half of the 19th century. This “Second Industrial Revolution” was different from the first. Instead of focusing on textile production and steam power, the Second Industrial Revolution ran on the internal combustion (gasoline or diesel) system. Also, more inventions were related to electrical systems, scientific discoveries, and medicine. Many had applications for the mechanization of warfare.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Communications. The first major development was the American invention of the telegraph in the 1840s. By the late 1850s, a telegraph cable was extended under the Atlantic, linking the British Isles to Canada and the U.S. By the 1870s, communication across the Pacific was achieved, and by 1902, the entire global British empire was connected by telegraph.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>In 1876, the telephone was invented in the U.S. Its popularity was greater than the telegraph because the user needed no special training, making it a consumer product.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>The radio (or “wireless telegraph”) was being developed near the end of this era.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Transportation. After the steamboat and steam train, the next major step in transportation was the electric trolley car and the subterranean transportation system, or subway.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>Both the trolley and the subway were mass-transit systems, first used in large cities like London, Paris, and New York.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>The automobile was invented in Germany in the 1880s. In this era, it was mostly an experimental machine and an object of curiosity.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C435">iii.</span>Improved transportation such as ocean-crossing steamboats led to massive migrations, especially from Europe to the Americas in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>

<p class="C916">Most participants in the Industrial Revolution had governments that guided its development. The federal government’s power rose dramatically after the American Civil War, and it adopted a strong pro-industry attitude. The U.S. courts favored business development over workers’ rights. In 1869, the U.S. completed the east-to-west Transcontinental Railroad, the world’s longest at the time.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>MEIJI JAPAN</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Using a show of industrial force, the American government sent navy ships to force open the trade door with Japan in the 1850s. The Japanese government responded not by resisting, like China, but by transforming its government, society, and industry.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>The Tokugawa Shogunate was replaced by the Meiji Restoration, with a Western-style constitutional monarchy. The Japanese built railroads, modernized their military, and constructed factories that specialized in silk textiles.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>One significant difference between Japanese and Western industrialization was that the Japanese government had close ties to factory corporations. The government built factories, then sold them to investors, but stayed actively involved in their finances and business decisions.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>RUSSIA</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Unlike Japan and the “West,” Russia’s industrial progress was limited. The government’s primary focus was on supporting the elite owners of large agricultural estates. Serfdom was still in place until the mid-19th century. The government freed the serfs, but unlike the U.S. and Japan, Russia was slow to shift to industrialization.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Late in this era, the Russian government sought foreign investment in its industrial program. Russia became a top producer of steel, and built the Trans-Siberian Railway, surpassing the U.S. in boasting the world’s longest railroad. Despite these accomplishments, Russia’s economy remained largely mired in the 15th century. Peasant laborers grew mostly wheat and potatoes for export from the large estates still owned by friends of the czar.</p>

This economic theory is “laissez-faire” capitalism, and caught on big-time in Western Europe in the 19th century.</p>

With the ever-expanding global market for machine-made goods came businesses that operated on a global scale.

U.S.-based United Fruit Corporation operated banana plantations throughout Central America, with its produce shipped to the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span>Governments took legal steps to protect transnational businesses, such as limiting how much financial liability a corporation could face if sued by a consumer. These are called limited-liability corporations.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>C.</strong></span>The exchange of goods and money among the industrialized economies grew so fast that they established a “gold standard” for world currencies. An agreed-upon international price of gold became the measure by which nations determined the relative value of their money systems. Stock markets in major financial centers like London and New York encouraged investments of capital from the middle and wealthy classes.</p>

<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>WESTERN EUROPE AND THE U.S.</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The Industrial Revolution resulted in more and larger cities. Seeking a steady income, people practically fled farm life and moved to cities to work in industrial jobs. With the boom in urban population came overcrowded living conditions, high levels of pollution, higher crime rates, and a poor and increasingly discontent working class. Pressures from these conditions led to proposals for sweeping changes in government policies, particularly in Europe and the U.S.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Pressures in cities and factories</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>Overcrowded cities created many problems: a shortage of decent housing, disease, and unemployment to name a few.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>The lower classes suffered the most and discontent spilled into the streets of many major European cities. Poor working conditions in factories, including hazardous machinery, long hours, and low pay led to anger and resentment among the laboring classes.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C435">iii.</span>Government leaders were often slow to respond to the calls for reform because they were either overwhelmed by or did not care about the numerous problems facing societies in the early years of the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C519">iv.</span>By the mid-19th century, however, political pressure from the increasingly important middle class stirred governments in Western and Central Europe to begin providing assistance to the urban working classes.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Calls for change</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>From the 1820s through the 1840s, European activists rallied the urban poor to take to the streets. The middle class was urged to use its new voting power to call for <span id="page_80"/>political rights for working-class men, increased pay, and safer working conditions in factories.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>Only a few men and women lobbied for voting rights for women in the early 19th century.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C435">iii.</span>Labor unions, representing the collective power of many workers began to form. The labor unions were illegal in most Western European nations until later in the 19th century.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>Karl Marx was considered the most radical activist among those calling for political change. In 1848, commenting on the plight of the working poor in London, Marx’s “Communist Manifesto” demanded overthrow of the “haves” (“bourgeoisie”) by the “have-nots” (“proletariat”). He envisioned the creation of a classless society where all people were politically, socially, and economically equal. At the time, the few people who read his materials thought these ideas had no chance of success.</p>
<p class="C423">5<span class="C349">.</span>Those in the new middle class did not take to the streets in support of the urban poor, but they did effect change with their new political rights. For example, they convinced government leaders to provide police services and cleaner drinking water in London, to build public housing in Paris, and to establish unemployment and social security benefits in the new nation of Germany.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>REACTIONS BEYOND THE WEST</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The Ottoman Empire’s attempts to westernize and compete with Western Europe in the 19th century, consisted of a movement toward a constitutional government—the Tanzimat Reforms—and the purchase of modern weapons from European manufacturers.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span><em>Tanzimat</em> means “reorganization” and that is what the reforms did to the Ottoman government. A written constitution with guaranteed political and social rights, including freedom of religion, a modernized banking system, railroad construction, and reorganization and modernization of the army were some of the major changes.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441"><span id="page_81"/><span class="C441">ii.</span></span>After 40 years under this first constitution, the Ottoman leader, the Sultan, canceled it and dissolved the legislature in 1876. He realized changes to the constitution called for limitations of his own powers.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C435">iii.</span>Later, another reform movement came from within the military. The “Young Turks” were Western-educated young army officers in the early 20th century who sought revival and extension of the Tanzimat reforms. They succeeded, but after World War I, the 700-year-old empire collapsed and was divided into many nations.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C519">iv.</span>Like the Russians, the Ottoman Empire had limited progress in developing modern industry in this era. The empire’s leaders failed to recognize the degree to which the Industrial Revolution was increasing the West’s political, economic, and military power. Unlike Japan’s leaders at this time, the Ottomans were divided over following Western Europe’s industrial model.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>The African continent remained a provider of natural resources to the world’s industrial giants. The greatest export in terms of cost were diamonds and gold from South Africa. In the Age of Imperialism (see <a href="17_Chapter_9_Unit_6__Consequences_o.html#page_85">Chapter 9</a>), Europe’s governments and businesses preferred to keep its African colonies dependent on them.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>As you have learned, Qing China rejected most things Western in this era and remained largely out of the Industrial Revolution. Some foreign investment provided for railroads and steamships, but overall the Middle Kingdom stayed with human labor to produce crops and hand-made items for export. Western Europe, the U.S., Russia, and Japan took advantage of China’s weak government by forcing open exclusive trade regions—“Spheres of Influence”—in China. So Russia traded in one region of China, Britain in another, and France in yet another. At the end of this era, these nations accepted a U.S. proposal for an “Open Door Policy” in China, ending the “Spheres of Influence” and allowing open access to all of its markets.</p>

<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>CAUSES OF CHANGES IN SOCIETIES</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>In Western countries, the rapid changes that industrialization had on the economy affected everyday life as well. In Britain, the factory system demanded a great deal of labor so men, women, and children moved from farms to cities to work in textile and other kinds of factories. Another factor in the move from farms to cities was the loss of farm jobs due to the increased use of labor-saving devices in agriculture.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>EFFECTS OF INDUSTRIALIZATION ON SOCIETIES</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Over time, wages rose so much that working outside the home became primarily a “man’s job.” As factories became more efficient, less human labor was required, so, for the most part, women and children left factory work. However, in many areas of the West, children continued to work in coal mines and in agricultural labor.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>As steady wages increased over time, a new social class arose in the industrial West: the middle class. This economic and social group between the rich and the poor had always existed, but in this era, it exploded in size and political power.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>As fewer children were needed for factory work because of increased efficiency of machinery, Western governments concerned about unsupervised, idle children passed laws requiring school attendance.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>Middle-class women were expected to marry and stay home to care for their families. These values created what we now call the “traditional family structure.” Urban families had fewer children than their rural counterparts. Single women increasingly found employment as teachers, replacing men. As the 20th century approached, women began to replace men in the business environment as secretaries and telephone operators. They were not allowed to vote in most Western societies until after World War I.</p>

<div class="C903">
<p class="C1142"><em><strong>The AP ® World History: Modern exam has been known to ask questions about the effects of industrialization on Japanese society especially on the conditions young women endured who were sent from rural areas by their families to work in silk factories. Unhealthy working conditions and threats from male supervisors were the subject of songs and poems written by “factory girls.”</strong></em></p>

<p class="C423">5<span class="C349">.</span>The limited impact of the Industrial Revolution on Latin America meant that continuities in social structures and gender roles remained through this era. In another major social development, millions of Europeans migrated to Latin America seeking new economic opportunities. In an interesting parallel, thousands of Japanese immigrants poured into the west coast of South America, mostly to work as laborers. (See <a href="17_Chapter_9_Unit_6__Consequences_o.html#page_85">Chapter 9</a>.)</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>ART AND LITERATURE</strong></p>
<p class="C924">The Industrial Revolution even affected art and literature. Is there anything it couldn’t do?!</p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Looking at the gritty life of overcrowded industrial cities, artists abandoned the optimism of the Romantic school of art of the early 19th century and shifted to Realism, painting dark scenes of city life, exemplified by locomotives belching black smoke.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>One new invention was the camera, which artists feared would put them out of business.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>The artistic style called Impressionism was in direct contrast to photography’s graphic realism. Artists painted deliberately unfocused scenes of nature—their “impression” of the scene. French artists led the way in this school of art.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Writers also responded to the effects of the Industrial Revolution. Charles Dickens wrote stories about life among the struggling urban laboring classes in soot-covered London in the early 19th century in his classics <em>A Christmas Carol</em> and <em>Oliver Twist</em>.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>SCIENCE AND MEDICINE</strong></p>
<p class="C924">Enormous advances were made in the fields of scientific discoveries and medicine.</p>
<p class="C423"><span id="page_84"/>1<span class="C349">.</span>The modern science of chemistry began in this era. Systematic studies of chemical compounds and the composition of different forms of matter gave scientists insights into how nature works. Toward the end of the era, scientists were developing chemical compounds in the lab; some were powerful fertilizers used to grow bigger crops (and thus more food, leading to more people) than ever before.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Advances in medicine included smallpox and rabies vaccinations, sterilization of surgical instruments, the use of anesthetics to “knock out” patients during surgery, and aspirin, to name a few. Governments oversaw programs that provided clean drinking water in cities. These and many other examples led to healthier, longer lives in the industrialized world.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Scientific developments and faith crossed swords in Charles Darwin. His investigations of animals of the South Pacific led him to conclude that natural selection, not God, determined the viability of species on Earth. He also theorized that man and apes had similar characteristics, and must therefore have common ancestors. These pronouncements began furious debates about the nature of mankind and its place among fellow humans and animals in the world. His ideas about “survival of the fittest” in the animal kingdoms led some Europeans to transfer the concept to human civilizations. <em>Social Darwinism</em>—wherein the superior races must naturally defeat inferior ones—had enormous implications in the Age of Imperialism (see <a href="17_Chapter_9_Unit_6__Consequences_o.html#page_85">Chapter 9</a>).</p>

<p class="C916">This chapter has outlined the enormous changes brought to societies by the Industrial Revolution. However, as always, some things stayed the same. For example, patriarchy in society remained, although women in industrialized countries began to see some political and economic gains. In sub-Saharan Africa and much of Asia, the Industrial Revolution was non-existent. Most people still maintained a religious belief; in Europe and the Americas, Christianity was predominant while from West Africa to Central Asia, Islam remained the primary faith.</p>
<p class="C916">Make a chart that tracks similar and different reactions to the Industrial Revolution in Europe, Japan, the Ottoman Empire, and China. Explain those similarities and differences.</p>
