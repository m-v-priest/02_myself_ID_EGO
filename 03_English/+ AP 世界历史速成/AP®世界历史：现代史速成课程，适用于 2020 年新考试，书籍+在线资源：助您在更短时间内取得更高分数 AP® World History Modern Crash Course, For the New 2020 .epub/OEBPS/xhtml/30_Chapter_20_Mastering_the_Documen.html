<p class="C695"><strong>Mastering the Document-Based Question</strong></p>
<p class="C681">Your multiple-choice and short-answer sections have been turned in; you’ve had a short break. Next you’ll face the Document-Based Question and the Long Essay Question. Both types of essays will be “to-what-extent” questions. The point is to show that history is not all one-sided. ALL the Mongols weren’t evil ALL the time, just like ALL your teachers aren’t mean ALL the time. Sometimes, like the Mongols, your teachers can be nice.</p>
<p class="C681">You have to prove to the exam graders that you understand that history was, “mostly <em>this</em>; however, there was a little of <em>that.</em>”</p>
<p class="C681">The DBQ and LEQ items will address Comparison (similarities and/or differences) or Causation (causes and/or effects) or Continuity and Change.</p>
<p class="C681">Examples of DBQ or LEQ essay prompts:</p>
<p class="C609"><span class="C1066">•</span><strong>Comparison essay:</strong> “Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which Japanese and Chinese responses to western influences in the 19th century were similar.”</p>
<p class="C615">One way to address this question is to develop an argument that Japan and China were mostly different in their responses to Western influences in the 19th century. For example, Japan adopted a Western-style constitutional monarchy and China did not. However, there were some similarities, such as both tried to maintain their independence from Western colonialism.</p>
<p class="C609"><span class="C1066">•</span><strong>Causation essay:</strong> “To what extent did the Industrial Revolution contribute to the high casualties in World War I?”</p>
<p class="C615">Here you could develop an argument that to a great extent, technology from the Industrial Revolution like the machine gun caused high casualties in World War I. To a lesser extent, the war lasted so long and millions died because of the refusal by the leaders on all sides to negotiate a peace early in the war.</p>
<p class="C609"><span class="C1066">•</span><strong>Continuity and Change essay:</strong> “Evaluate the extent of change in religious traditions in the Americas from c. 1500 to c. 1750.” <span id="page_178"/>A good response would develop an essay that argued that there was a great deal of change in religious traditions in the Americas after the introduction of Christianity by Europeans, but that some continuities remained, such as the blending of some African practices with Christianity to form Vodun (“Voodoo”).</p>
<p class="C615">Did you notice that all these responses include “a lot of <em>this</em> but a little of <em>that</em>”? You can practice by writing essays that compare two friends—How they are they mostly similar, but have some differences. Or, which is greater, continuities or changes in your own life in the past five years? “I am mostly the same in where I live and what I eat; however, I am a little different in what I wear.” Then provide specific examples and explain why.</p>
<p class="C615">These writing concepts will help you learn how to approach the DBQ and LEQ.</p>
<p class="C615">It’s easy to check on your progress as you work through the DBQ and the long essay. Just above the question on the exam, you will see bulleted reminders of the scoring rubric. Check off each bullet as you complete the corresponding task in your essay.</p>
<p class="C681">The DBQ is the first essay you’ll encounter, and it is also the most difficult to master. However, thousands of students do well on it—why not you?</p>
<p class="C681">The Document-Based Question is just that—a question with documents. Your job is to incorporate the documents and your knowledge of world history into an essay that addresses <em>all</em> parts of the question. It is worth 25% of your total score. You will have 60 minutes to write it, which includes a 15-minute prep period. There will be seven documents that you must discuss, organize and analyze. The DBQ will cover historical developments or processes from somewhere between the years 1450 and 2001.</p>
<p class="C681">The DBQ is scored on a scale up to 7 points. Few essays earn a 7, so don’t worry about that. Just follow these tips, practice writing, and do your best. Each DBQ point is equal to about five multiple-choice questions, so keep that in mind as you prepare. Every rubric point is a big deal.</p>
<p class="C681">You’ll find a DBQ with the online practice exam available with this book (see inside front cover).</p>
<p class="C681">The rubric requires you to do the following:</p>
<p class="C618">(1<span class="C435">)</span>Have a thesis that addresses all parts of the question with an argument or line of reasoning, with examples showing “a lot of this; but, a little of that.”</p>
<p class="C618"><span id="page_179"/>(2<span class="C435">)</span>Put the question into historical context.</p>
<p class="C618">(3<span class="C435">)</span>Correctly incorporate and explain the significance of at least 6 of the 7 documents in direct response to the question (up to 2 points).</p>
<p class="C618">(4<span class="C435">)</span>Include at least one example of outside information not found in the documents that connects to the question.</p>
<p class="C618">(5<span class="C435">)</span>Discuss point-of-view (POV) (Why did they create it? How do they know what they’re talking about? Who is the intended audience?) with at least 3 documents.</p>
<p class="C618">(6<span class="C435">)</span>Show “complexity” in your essay. Analyze both similarities AND differences, or continuity AND change, or causes AND effects, or perhaps compare what happened in the era of the question to another era in world history.</p>
<p class="C618">Point total: 7</p>

<p class="C1142"><em><strong>AP</strong></em><strong>® <em>World History exam readers don’t start at 7 points and knock off points for mistakes. They begin at zero and add points for things you do correctly. Exam readers realize that this is a high-pressure exam and that your essay is a first draft. They read beyond your mistakes and assign points based on what you did right.</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p class="C307"><strong>HOW TO APPROACH THE DBQ</strong></p>
<p class="C401"><strong>FIRST:</strong></p>
<p class="C563"><strong>Read the question.</strong> Pause. Take a deep breath. Read it again, slower this time. Make sure you <em>understand and underline all the tasks of the question</em>.</p>
<p class="C401"><strong>SECOND:</strong></p>
<p class="C563"><strong>Make a list of historical developments</strong> that pop into your head from the era of the question. You can access this as a source of outside information in the essay. The folks who create the DBQ purposefully leave out key information in the Source line of each document to push you into thinking about outside information. The Source line might say, “A letter from Mohandas Gandhi.” Your job would be to add outside information about the historical significance of Gandhi.</p>
<p class="C401"><strong><span id="page_180"/>THIRD:</strong></p>
<p class="C563"><strong>Tackle the documents.</strong> Discuss, analyze, and organize the documents. Read them, make notes in the margins on what each one says. Organize them into “a lot of this” and “a little of that,” based on the prompt. Next: What is significant about each document? You can force yourself to answer that question by writing, “This shows . . . ” about each document in your essay.</p>
<p class="C563">Look for Point of View (POV): For what purpose was this document made: to persuade, intimidate, or even trick someone? <strong><em>Or</em></strong> . . . Does this person really know what they’re talking about? <strong><em>Or</em></strong> . . . Who is the intended audience of the document? <strong><em>Or</em></strong> . . . Describe the document’s tone: angry? submissive? confused? ANY of these could count for POV.</p>
<p class="C563">Now you are ready to write the essay. Note: The exam graders aren’t looking for exactly the format that follows. Think of this as a guide to help you sort through the essay writing process.</p>
<p class="C307"><strong>THE DBQ ESSAY</strong></p>
<p class="C563"><strong>Thesis:</strong> Includes (1) all parts of the question with specific examples and (2) makes a historically defensible claim that establishes a line of reasoning. Your thesis MUST be at the beginning or at the end of your essay. Graders know you are under pressure, so if your first thesis attempt falls short, they go to the end of the essay and look for an acceptable statement in your conclusion.</p>
<p class="C401"><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong></p>
<p class="C563">A prompt that asks you to evaluate the extent to which globalization caused economic changes in Asia after World War II might start with this thesis:</p>
<p class="C646">There was a great deal of economic change in Asia after World War II due to globalization, for example the rise of the “Asian Tigers” like South Korea. However, some parts of Asia seemed isolated from these changes, like in rural parts of western China and Afghanistan.” See? A lot of <em>this</em> (“a great deal”); however, a little of <em>that</em> (“some parts”)<em>.</em></p>
<p class="C563">Of course, the content of the documents will guide you through the creation of your thesis.</p>
<p class="C634"><strong><span id="page_181"/>Paragraph 2, Context:</strong> Briefly put the topic of the question in historical context.</p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>How did we get to the beginning point of the question? In this example, briefly define the term, “globalization,” and where Asia fit into that process at the end of World War II.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>You could also briefly describe other big social/cultural/political/or environmental processes that were happening in the era of the question. This information must connect to the question in some way</p>
<p class="C1083">“World War II was the biggest and worst war in history. Much of Asia was fought over, and at the end, the economies of countries like Japan and China were totally ruined. Programs promoted by communist and capitalist countries tried to rebuild the world into their image and pull Asia and the rest of the world into global markets.”</p>
<p class="C1083"><strong><em>Or . . .</em></strong></p>
<p class="C1083">“World War II brought huge leaps in technology in communication and transportation. These advancements led to increased global markets, connecting Asia to the rest of the world in new and bigger ways.”</p>
<p class="C916"><strong>The next paragraphs discuss, analyze, and organize the documents in response to the question.</strong></p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span>Name your first group/argument (“a lot of this”) with a topic sentence that introduces this paragraph;</p>
<p class="C933">Here’s an example: “Globalization created many economic changes in Asia after WWII.”</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span>Name the source of each document (who said/wrote it?)</p>
<p class="C933">Example: “Changes included rapid industrialization, as seen in Doc 1, a speech by the president of Korea in 1988.”</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>C.</strong></span>Tell the reader what each document represents and its significance to your argument in your own words. Quoting from the document is not necessary. (AP® graders want to <span id="page_182"/>see that you are “wrestling” with the document and not just repeating it)</p>
<p class="C933">To continue from the example above in B: “He says that without globalization, Korea would still be a third world country. This shows how far Korea advanced economically after the Korean War.” Remember, you need not spend time rewriting the quotes from a document. Summarize the author’s thoughts and include, “This shows . . . .”</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>D.</strong></span>Attach point-of-view (POV) to as many documents as you can in this group. (See earlier POV discussion.)</p>
<p class="C933">Continuing from the example above in C: “As Korea’s leader, he is proud of his country’s changes. His speech was before a crowd of supporters, who clearly agreed with his views.”</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>E.</strong></span>Include information not found in the documents (outside information) relevant to your argument. Look for hints in the Source line of the documents and in the list you made of events during the era of the question.</p>
<p class="C933">One way to do this in the example you’ve been following: “South Korea’s economy boomed in the late 20th century greatly because of huge support from the U.S. and creative Korean entrepreneurs.”</p>
<p class="C933">In a new paragraph, address your “a little of that” group of documents and arguments in the same way as your “a lot of this” group. In this example, a topic sentence could be:</p>
<p class="C646">“However, in some places in Asia, globalization caused little economic change after WWII.” And go from there, using the examples above as your guide: Document analysis, POV, outside information.</p>
<p class="C916"><strong>Address both sides of the question. (“Complexity”)</strong></p>
<p class="C916">If there is a question about similarities and differences or continuities and changes, in many cases, you handled this in your “a lot of this; however, a little of that” analysis. But look back and make sure, especially if the question is about causes or effects. This is the place in a “causes” essay to talk briefly about a couple of specific effects, and vice versa.</p>
<p class="C916"><strong>Finally, write a conclusion</strong> that addresses all parts of the question with specific examples. It might count as your thesis if the one at the beginning of your essay falls short.</p>
<p class="C916"><span id="page_183"/>If you finish your essay ahead of the 60-minute time frame, review your work and make any necessary corrections. AP® readers understand it’s a first-draft essay in a high-pressure situation. If you have extra time, don’t waste it—add information, cross stuff out, and revise whole paragraphs, if you need to. You can even write new material, circle it, draw an arrow where it’s supposed to go, and put “insert here” on the DBQ and long essay.</p>
<p class="C916"><strong>DBQ Musts for 7 points:</strong></p>
<p class="C653"><span class="C656">•</span>You must have an acceptable thesis.</p>
<p class="C653"><span class="C656">•</span>You must have a discussion of context.</p>
<p class="C653"><span class="C656">•</span>You must discuss and analyze at least 6 documents. (2 points).</p>
<p class="C653"><span class="C656">•</span>You must have at least 3 POV (points of view).</p>
<p class="C653"><span class="C656">•</span>You must discuss at least 1 example of outside information.</p>
<p class="C653"><span class="C656">•</span>You must show “complexity” in your argument.</p>
