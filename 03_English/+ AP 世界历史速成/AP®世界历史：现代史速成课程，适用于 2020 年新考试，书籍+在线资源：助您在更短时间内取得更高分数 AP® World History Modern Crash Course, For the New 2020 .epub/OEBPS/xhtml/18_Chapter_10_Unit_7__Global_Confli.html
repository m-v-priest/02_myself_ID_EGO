<p class="C1189"><strong>Global Conflict</strong></p>
<p class="C1191"><strong>c. 1900 to the Present</strong></p>
<p class="C398">Some historians regard the two world wars as one event with a pause in between. Other major European wars had similar patterns: Nations fighting the Hundred Years War and the Thirty Years War took long “time-outs” between hostilities. The Cold War followed World War II and threatened global nuclear war.</p>

<p class="C916">The 20th century began with European empires in control around the globe. The Western mindset would assume things would stay that way. In 1900, the U.S. and Japan were rising powers, while Russia and China were crumbling from within. By the end of the 20th century, after two world wars and a global “Cold War,” European hegemony (control) had declined dramatically, and China’s power was rapidly on the rise. In between those historical bookends, European colonies around the world gained independence, and Russia became the first of many communist nations. After World War II, Russia, now called the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), and the United States led their allies through decades of global tensions. By 2000, Cold War worries had faded, but new challenges to political, social, and economic stability emerged.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>OLDER, DECLINING POWERS</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Both Spain and Portugal saw their empires dwindle because of successful independence movements in Latin America against their rule. In addition, Spain’s defeat in the Spanish-American War in 1898 effectively marked the end of that empire and the rise of the U.S. on the global stage.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>While many European neighbors were “going global” during the Age of Imperialism, the Ottoman Empire was shrinking. <span id="page_98"/>Beginning with the successful nationalistic Greek rebellion for independence in the 1820s, it lost territories in the Balkan Peninsula in Eastern Europe and faced growing opposition in its Arab holdings in Southwest Asia and North Africa. In addition, Russia and Britain fought the Crimean War over the Ottoman Empire’s vital Bosporus and Dardanelles sea lanes near Constantinople. While the Empire came out on the winning side with its British and French allies against Russia, it remained a weakened “Sick Man of Europe” and by the early 20th century sought alliances in an attempt to hang on.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>The Russian Empire declined in the 19th century even though it stretched across more territory than any other empire in the world. Attempts to overthrow the czar led to some reforms like freeing the serfs but also increased government oppression of opponents, mostly socialists and communists. In 1905, Russia shockingly lost a war with Japan, triggering a revolt that further reduced the czar’s power.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>Qing China began the 19th century as the world’s top economy, but began declining after the Opium Wars with Britain and France. Weak leaders, a civil war, famine, and a refusal to commit to industrialization pushed China into disarray by 1900.</p>
<p class="C423">5<span class="C349">.</span>The Austrian Empire, a major European power in the early 19th century, fragmented into many groups, based on ethnicity.</p>
<p class="C423">6<span class="C349">.</span>Last-ditch attempts by these failing empires to maintain power produced tensions that led to World War I.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The Mexican Revolution of the early 20th century saw great political and social upheaval, including a long civil war. The result was a new constitution that promised free public education, land reform, and the reduced influence of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Mexico nationalized its oil reserves and production from foreign control in 1938.</p>

<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>OUTBREAK OF WORLD WAR I</strong></p>
<p class="C924">The event that sparked World War I was the tragic, but seemingly inconsequential, assassination of the future emperor of Austria-Hungary. A chain of reactions to the assassination led to a realignment of the alliances into the “Allies,” initially Britain, France, Russia, and Italy, and the “Central Powers,” Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>CAUSES OF WORLD WAR I INCLUDED:</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Failing Empires (discussed earlier)</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Imperialism. The colonial powers of Europe had competed for decades over land in Africa and Asia. Early in the 20th century, wrangling continued over ever-diminishing amounts of unclaimed territories.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Nationalism. Tensions rose inside empires like Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Russia from ethnic groups that wanted to break off and form their own nations.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>Arms races. The Industrial Revolution mass-produced weapons that could kill at faster rates, and from longer distances, than ever before. National pride among the “Great Powers” of Europe started an unofficial competition between governments to see which could produce the best weapons. Eventually, they decided to try them out on each other.</p>
<p class="C423">5<span class="C349">.</span>Alliance system. Rather than risking going to war alone, the Great Powers formed two competing military alliances in the early 20th century: Russia, Britain, and France formed the Triple Entente and Germany, Italy, and Austria-Hungary formed the Triple Alliance. Geographically, the Entente was positioned on Germany’s eastern and western borders.</p>
<p class="C423">6<span class="C349">.</span>All of these factors led to heightened tensions in Europe by 1914. A chain reaction to the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand led to a realignment of the alliances into the “Allies,” initially Britain, France, Russia, and Italy, and the “Central Powers” of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong><span id="page_100"/>C.</strong></span><strong>POSTWAR LEAGUE OF NATIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C924">Survivors prayed that World War I would indeed be the “war to end all wars.” No previous conflict had caused as much widespread destruction of lives, property, and empires. The creation of a global League of Nations at the war’s end in 1918, designed to keep the peace, gave many people hope that governments and individuals had learned their lesson. Their hopes were short-lived.</p>

<p class="C916">No one expected a long war—especially Germany, which attacked France and Russia simultaneously, anticipating a restoration of stability in Europe with a German flavor. When that did not occur, the two sides hunkered down into defensive positions in France (the Western Front) and Russia (the Eastern Front) by the end of 1914. By 1915, fighting spread to the Ottoman Empire and the European colonies in Africa.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span>New weapons of World War I—the machine gun, poison gas, the airplane and the submarine to name a few—led to changes in tactics and philosophy about war itself. The Industrial Revolution showed its ugly side by producing weapons of mass destruction. The machine gun forced combatants into defensive trenches, but despite the gun’s tactical advantage, military leaders sent long lines of men to charge across open fields called “no man’s land.”</p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The result was a tremendous loss of life, which had the unintended consequence of lowering the value of humanity in war. Thus, all civilians became legitimate targets in “total war”—where the full economic and political power of nations was engaged in military victory. Women replaced men in factories in large numbers.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Submarines torpedoed enemy civilian and military ships and airplanes bombed cities. Air warfare had even greater consequences in World War II.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong><span id="page_101"/>B.</strong></span><strong>USE OF COLONIAL SOLDIERS</strong></p>
<p class="C933">European colonization resulted in recruiting soldiers from Africa and Asia to fight. India, for example, committed one million troops to aid the British forces.</p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Canada, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, autonomous members of the British Empire, also sent hundreds of thousands of troops to support the Allies’ cause.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>The British also convinced Arabs to fight the Ottoman Empire in Southwest Asia with Arab independence from the Ottomans as a reward.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>USE OF PROPAGANDA</strong></p>
<p class="C933">Both the Allied and the Central Powers used government-produced posters, advertisements, and even movies to stir patriotism for their side and hatred for their enemies.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>END OF WORLD WAR I</strong></p>
<p class="C933">In 1917, the U.S. entered World War I on the Allies’ side “to make the world safe for democracy,” according to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson. By late 1918, the Central Powers had run out of human resources to wage war, and an armistice was signed. The U.S. proposed the Fourteen Points Plan, which was designed to stop future wars. The key component was an international organization—the League of Nations—formed to settle differences between member nations in order to avoid war.</p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The Russian, Austrian, Ottoman, and German empires dissolved. Two Allied nations, the U.S. and Japan, emerged with their industrial capacity and colonial possessions intact, unlike most of Europe.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Conducting the war amid rising internal unrest was too great for the Russian czar’s government. In 1917, it collapsed and was replaced by a provisional democracy. But the new government quickly fell to a communist uprising. Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin negotiated an early withdrawal from the war with the German government. (Details of the rise of the world’s first communist regime are covered later in this chapter.)</p>
<p class="C423"><span id="page_102"/>3<span class="C349">.</span>Arming colonial subjects to support Europe’s war effort was shortsighted. Nationalist leaders in African and Asian colonies used their experience in military training to revolt in the years after World War I. In addition, many elites had learned about European ideals, such as self-rule, while attending European schools. Another encouragement for leaders of colonial independence movements was found in a key feature of the Fourteen Points Plan—a call for “self-determination” for nationalist groups.</p>

<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>GREAT DEPRESSION</strong></p>
<p class="C933">The end of World War I brought great optimism that future wars would be impossible. Most survivors also thought that riches were just around the corner. Unfortunately, the closely connected global economy began to fail for many European nations after World War I.</p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The U.S. economy, the world’s strongest, collapsed at the end of the “Roaring Twenties,” further damaging the world’s markets in the global Great Depression.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>As a result, the industrialized nations reorganized their governments to be more active in financial matters, including government programs of social security, unemployment compensation, bank regulation, and many others. Italy, Germany, and Japan were prominent in radically changing their governmental and financial systems to address the economic crisis.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>COMMUNISM</strong></p>
<p class="C933">Even before the Great Depression, Russia withdrew from the Allies during World War I because of lack of progress on the Eastern Front and civil strife in the cities, especially in the capital of Petrograd (previously called St. Petersburg). In 1917, the czar resigned and within six months, a communist revolution began. A civil war ended in 1922 with the communists victorious.</p>
<p class="C423"><span id="page_103"/>1<span class="C349">.</span>For the next several years, leaders consolidated power, ruthlessly killing many real and imagined enemies. High priority was given to military modernization.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>The new communist government set up Five-Year Plans for economic goals for the command economy (planned and directed by the government).</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Many historians believe that policy insulated the USSR from the Great Depression. However, during that time the Soviet Union’s leaders—in particular the dictator Stalin—were committing mass atrocities against their people.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>FASCISM</strong></p>
<p class="C933">Italy was disgruntled by the Treaty of Versailles because it did not gain as many benefits as its allies, Britain and France. In 1922, the democratic government was overthrown and replaced by leaders who promoted fascism.</p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Fascist ideology claimed to solve the failures of capitalism and the extreme policies of communism. The government formed coalitions with banks and industries, eventually taking charge of most of the economy. Many public works programs like dam-building and upgrading railroads were undertaken. Modernization of the military had high importance.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>As in the USSR, dissent was brutally crushed by Italy’s dictator, Mussolini.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Fascism seemed to work to outsiders who didn’t look too closely, and gained popularity in Western Europe, especially in Germany and Japan.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>Germany’s unstable economy and government after World War I made it ripe for radical change. Hitler inspired the masses with promises while killing opponents more to the left (communists) and on the right (the Weimar Republic). By 1934, Hitler had declared himself the unquestioned dictator of National Socialist (Nazi) Germany.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>THE NEW DEAL AND SIMILAR PROGRAMS</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The U.S. government dealt with the Great Depression with the New Deal, which involved higher taxes on the wealthy, deficit spending, massive public works programs, and social welfare <span id="page_104"/>policies. Britain and France attempted similar programs, but with fewer resources they continued to struggle economically.</p>

<p class="C916">World War I ended with many issues unresolved: What to do with European colonies around the world? How to slow the spread of military technology? How to deal with colonial nationalist movements? What to do about a new communist Russian nation and how to recover from the economic, political, and social damage of World War I? About 20 million soldiers and civilians died in the war, which was fought predominantly in Europe, but also in Southwest Asia and Africa. The political, social, and economic impact of the loss of so many people shaped many Europeans’ attitudes about war for the next two decades.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Ended World War I</p>

<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Created the League of Nations, but also dictated terms to the Central Powers focused on punishing Germany. Many Germans strongly resented the victorious Allied nations, especially after their economy imploded due to the harsh reparation demands from Britain and France. Many vengeful Germans sought alternatives to the new democracy imposed by the Allies.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>Although the U.S. proposed the formation of the League of Nations, it was never a member, thus contributing to the League’s limitations and ultimate failure.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>INTERNATIONAL TREATIES</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Between the world wars, international treaties sought to limit the expansion of military might, and thus reduce the chance of war.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>The Five Power Treaty, the London Naval Conference of 1930, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact were the most important.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong><span id="page_105"/>C.</strong></span><strong>MANDATE SYSTEM</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The African, Asian, and Pacific colonies of Germany and the Ottoman Empire were taken by the League of Nations and redistributed among the victors, especially France and Britain, who set up a mandate system.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>The League decided that those colonies weren’t ready for independence, so they would be governed by Britain, France, or some other ally.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span> This policy only fueled nationalist feelings among the Arab provinces of the Ottomans (like Syria and Jordan) and the Europeans’ African colonies.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>“GREATER EAST ASIA CO-PROSPERITY SPHERE”</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Between the wars, Japan extended its control over East and Southeast Asia, creating the “Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere,” which it professed would liberate these regions from Western oppression. In reality, Japan exploited member nations like Thailand and Burma for their own economic gain. The best-known member of the Sphere was Manchukuo, in northeast China and Manchuria. Many people in this “puppet state” were practically enslaved to serve the Japanese empire.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>By far the most important example of resistance to European colonialism in this era was the Indian National Congress, which formed in the late 19th century.</p>

<p class="C916">Primarily a continuation of unresolved issues from World War I, World War II outdid its predecessor in duration, global scope, use of military technology, and death.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong><span id="page_106"/>A.</strong></span>The Treaty of Versailles, discussed previously, required Germany to accept full guilt for the war, reduce its military forces, hand over its colonies and pay billions in war reparations to Britain and France.

<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Japan overran its neighbors even before it officially turned to fascism. Some historians argue that World War II really started in 1931 when Japan subdued Manchuria, killed or enslaved its peoples, and occupied their coal mines and factories.

<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>APPEASEMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C933">The well-intentioned but weak leaders in Britain and France, and the League of Nations could not stop aggression by Italy, Germany, and Japan in the 1930s. Europe’s democracies hoped that fascists would be appeased after limited conquests and seek no more territory.</p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>This policy of <em>appeasement</em> only encouraged the attackers who showed no respect for the League’s hopes for peace.</p>

<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>AXIS vs. ALLIES</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>As in World War I, there were two alliances in World War II: the Allies and the Axis Powers. The Axis remained constant. The Allies grew in number as they came under attack by Axis nations. Germany, Italy, and Japan formed the Axis. Britain, France, and most of Western Europe formed the Allies by 1940. A year later, the USSR and the U.S. joined the Allies.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>WAR TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<p class="C933">Unlike World War I, which featured defensive fighting like trench warfare, World War II saw fast-moving fronts.</p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Technology improved the machines that were introduced in World War I. Tanks and airplanes moved much faster by the 1930s and defensive trenches were impractical.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Germany introduced the new tactic of <em>blitzkrieg</em>, which involved massive bombing by airplanes, rapid advances of tanks and waves of soldiers, all designed to quickly overwhelm the enemy—which was most of Europe.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>TOTAL WAR</strong></p>
<p class="C933">As in World War I, but on a much bigger scale, governments used the media to promote the war through propaganda such as patriotic movies, posters, and radio broadcasts.</p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Civilians in enemy countries were often considered equal targets as soldiers. Massive bombing campaigns by air killed millions of them in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Even in Western democracies, governments directed factory production, rationed food and goods, and rounded up dissenters.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>The USSR and the Axis Powers killed many alleged spies and war opponents.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>SCOPE OF WORLD WAR II</strong></p>
<p class="C933">World War II’s battlefields were on a more global scale. The Pacific theater was added to those in Europe and Africa.</p>
<p class="C423"><span id="page_108"/>1<span class="C349">.</span>Europe. The war officially started in 1939 when Germany invaded Poland. In 1938, Britain had appeased the German fascist dictator Hitler in his conquest of central Europe, but drew a line at Poland. After war was declared, Germany swiftly conquered most of Western Europe, including France by 1940. Russia and Germany completed a peace treaty in 1939, so Britain faced Nazi aggression alone.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Two significant events in 1941 turned the tide against Nazi Germany: Hitler’s surprise invasion of Russia went poorly for Germany, and the U.S. entered the war against the Axis Powers after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Unlike in World War I, Russia stayed with the Allies to the end of the war, despite suffering perhaps 25 million deaths.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>The turning point of the war was the Allied invasion of France in 1944. By May 1945, Allies had pressed Germany from the east (USSR) and west (U.S., Britain, France) to force an unconditional surrender.</p>
<p class="C423">5<span class="C349">.</span>North Africa. The first Allied offensive against the Axis powers was in North Africa. From there, the Allies pushed into Italy to put pressure on the Axis.</p>
<p class="C423">6<span class="C349">.</span>Asia and the Pacific</p>

<p class="C916">Some governments attempted to exterminate groups of people deemed unworthy to live.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>ARMENIAN GENOCIDE</strong></p>
<p class="C933">Starting in 1915, the Ottoman Empire launched a campaign labeled “Turkey for the Turks” against the Christian Armenian minority, killing about 1.5 million people and exiling many others. Survivors scattered to many countries, including Russia and the U.S.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>UKRAINIAN GENOCIDE</strong></p>
<p class="C933">Early under communist rule in the USSR, peasant farmers were granted small plots of land and cattle to raise. Stalin changed the policy, collectivizing huge tracts of farmland and requiring farmers to meet government requisitions for produce. Farmers in Ukraine (a large state in the USSR) revolted, and Stalin retaliated by hauling away what food there was, leaving the farm families to starve to death in what is known as the Artificial Famine of 1932–33. Others were hauled to gulags (prison camps); still others were shot. About 10 million died.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE JEWISH HOLOCAUST</strong></p>
<p class="C933">Central to Nazi philosophy was holding Jews responsible for the world’s problems throughout history. Hitler preached about creating a pure “Aryan” German nation, free from Jews and others he thought undesirable. Beginning with denying Jews civil rights, continuing with forcing them into “ghettos” (areas of town where Jews had to live), later imprisonment in concentration camps and ending with the “final solution” of death, 6 million of Europe’s 9 million Jews were executed.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong><span id="page_110"/>D.</strong></span><strong>CAMBODIAN GENOCIDE</strong></p>
<p class="C933">In the late 1970s, the radical communist government in Cambodia—the Khmer Rouge—set out to purge the nation of all ethnic and religious minorities and suspected political opponents. About 2 million of Cambodia’s 8 million people were murdered.</p>

<p class="C914">Practice your arguing skills for the exam by addressing this question:</p>
<p class="C924"><em>What causes governments to go to war on a global scale?</em></p>
<p class="C914">This chapter discusses many factors, including the three below. Rapid changes in population due to massive migrations, improved medicine, and greater food production (due to improved fertilizers and mechanization of farms) led to social, political, environmental, and economic strains. These tensions contributed to the other factors you learned about in this chapter that led to two world wars in the 20th century. Three of these factors are:</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>FAILING EMPIRES</strong></p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>CHALLENGES TO THE EXISTING ORDER</strong></p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>IMPROVED MILITARY TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<p class="C933">Review this chapter and place the causes of World War I and World War II under each of the three categories above. Next, rank your choices from the greatest to least cause. Defend your choice for greatest cause with specific examples.</p>
<p class="C933">Now, drill down a little more. Which of the outcomes (that is, effects) of World War I was the greatest cause of World War II? Defend your answer.</p>
