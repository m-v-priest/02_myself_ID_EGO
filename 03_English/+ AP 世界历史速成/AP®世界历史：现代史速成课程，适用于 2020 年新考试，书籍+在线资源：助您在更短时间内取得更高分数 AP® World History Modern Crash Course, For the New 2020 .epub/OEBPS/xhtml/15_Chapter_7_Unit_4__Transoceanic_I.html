<p class="C1191"><strong>c. 1450 to c. 1750</strong></p>
<p class="C916">Your studies have reached the point where we can talk about true global history! In the era c. 1450–c. 1750, the Americas, Australia, and the Pacific Islands joined Afro-Eurasia in networks of exchange. The encounters between the peoples of Europe and the Americas had profound social, political, economic, demographic, and environmental effects on both sides of the Atlantic, and then the world.</p>

<p class="C916">Advances in ship design and navigation reached Europe via trade routes from East Asia through the Islamic world of Eurasia. China and India were very advanced compared to Europe at the beginning of this period. These changes benefitted European ship builders, sailors, and scientists.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span>Benefits to Europe from trade with Asia by the end of the previous era included not only spices and other commodities, but also technology. The compass, more accurate maps, the astrolabe (used to determine latitude), and improved rudders and sails—all transferred from Asia—contributed to Europe’s ability to make long-distance sailing expeditions.</p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Portuguese shipbuilders introduced the caravel, based on Islamic designs, to explore Africa’s Atlantic coast in the 15th century.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>The introduction of the lateen sail (shaped like a triangle) around 1500 made ships more maneuverable, allowing them to tack, or sail, against the wind and thus extend their voyages into the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean from the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong><span id="page_54"/>B.</strong></span>A “Scientific Revolution” transformed European approaches to science—from haphazard methods to more logical experimentation, concepts picked up from indirect contact with Muslim and Chinese scholars. The telescope, microscope, barometer and new forms of math, such as calculus, are just a few innovations.</p>

<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>NEW WESTERN EUROPEAN STATES SPONSORED TRANSOCEANIC VOYAGES</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>At the beginning of this era, motivated by “competition” from the Muslim faith in the Mediterranean world, Western European Christians—especially those of Portugal and Spain, who had recently completed a “reconquista” (reconquering) of the Iberian Peninsula from Muslim control—sought to spread their gospel to new areas, particularly South and East Asia, where conversion had thus far been limited. Expeditions almost always included missionaries.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>The Protestant Reformation caused a renewed missionary vigor among the Catholic monarchs in Western Europe, who did not want their faith to “lose ground” to new and rapidly growing religions.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Trade was also a major motivator for European exploration. You’ve already learned about how the flow of silk, technology, and spices westward from Asia increased wealth and triggered a desire to by-pass the long chain of middlemen that separated European consumers from the riches of the East.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>The new kings and kingdoms in Spain, Portugal, France, and Britain wanted to display their power by funding explorations.</p>
<p class="C423">5<span class="C349">.</span>Why Western Europe and not Eastern Europe? Like the nations in Western Europe, Russia also had access to the new shipping technology and sent ships north into the Arctic Ocean seeking a route to East Asia. Icy conditions, however, made that passage impossible. At the same time, Russia was expanding its land empire across Siberia and did not enter the Pacific until the 17th century. Other nations in Central and Eastern Europe had limited access to the sea and/or were not yet organized to mount such expeditions.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong><span id="page_55"/>B.</strong></span><strong>PORTUGAL LED THE WAY TO NEW LANDS, FOLLOWED BY SPAIN, ENGLAND, FRANCE, AND THE DUTCH</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Why were Portugal and Spain the first European nations to venture south (Portugal) and west (Spain) into the Atlantic? Geography was a big reason. Both countries “stick out” into the Atlantic more than other European nations. Portugal’s proximity to Africa made it a logical target of early coastal exploration. In addition, the newly united nation-state of Spain had just completed a centuries-long campaign to restore the Iberian Peninsula to Christian control. Thus, Spain’s leaders had much patriotic energy and were willing to spend money to expand their economic, religious, and political influence beyond their borders.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Portugal’s Prince Henry the Navigator sent many ships down the western coast of Africa looking for a route to the Indies (islands near India in Southeast Asia), in order to set up direct trade with South Asia. Along the way, they charted the Madeira and the Azores Islands. In 1498, Vasco da Gama succeeded in reaching India and returned to Portugal with spices and other valuable goods. (By the way, one of my all-time favorite lines from a student’s essay is, “Flavor and spices were brought back from India by Tabasco da Gama.”) The Portuguese finally established their link to the East, but had the Spanish beaten them?</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Spain sought a different route to the East—they had little choice since the Portuguese staked out Africa’s coast, and Italian merchants sailed the Mediterranean for goods.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>Spain thought the only land mass on Earth was Afro-Eurasia—so sailing west across the Atlantic would bring a ship straight to the islands near India, the Indies, and maybe even China (“Cathay”).</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>Columbus convinced the Spanish royals to fund an expedition for God and for gold—in this case, “gold” meant anything of great value, like spices, silk, or gold. Columbus sought glory. Thus we get the famous “Three G’s of Exploration”—God, glory, and gold.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C340">iii.</span>If Columbus were to reach the East and return, he would put Spain ahead of Portugal, which in 1492 was still trying to find India.</p>
<p class="C423"><span id="page_56"/>4<span class="C349">.</span>The Spanish thought Columbus had reached Southeast Asia. Instead, of course, he found a New World. Eventually, his landing place, Cuba, and the surrounding islands, were labeled the “West Indies” and its people were called “Indians”—which shows you how much Spain was aiming for the prize of Southeast Asia’s Spice Islands, the real Indies. Over time, however, after Spain began to accumulate great agricultural and mining wealth from the New World, it seemed Columbus’s voyages were not the “mistake” that many in Spain thought.</p>

<p class="C916">Historians refer to the transfer of animals, plants, diseases, and people that resulted from contacts between Europeans and Amerindians (Native Americans in both North and South America) as the “Columbian Exchange,” after the explorer Columbus, who started the process in 1492. Note that this was a two-way exchange, to and from the Americas.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>ANIMALS AND PLANTS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXCHANGE</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>From Afro-Eurasia to the Americas, Europeans brought horses, pigs, chickens, cows, sugarcane, bananas, wheat, and rice.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Effects on the environment were enormous, as you will see.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>The introduction of horses to the New World changed the cultures of almost every Native American group as the Americas were without large domesticated animals that could be used for transportation and agriculture (unless you want to count the South American llama and alpaca).</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>Sugarcane plantations throughout the Caribbean world helped create rich European kingdoms, and resulted in the importation of slaves from Africa.</p>
<p class="C423">5<span class="C349">.</span>From the Americas to Afro-Eurasia, Europeans returned with few animals that had a global impact, but among plants, they brought back potatoes, tomatoes, tobacco, American corn (maize), cocoa, as well as chili and other peppers.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>Potato was king in Europe. It stored well on ships and grew in a wide variety of soils and climates.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441"><span id="page_57"/><span class="C441">ii.</span></span>Maize became a staple in both Africa and China.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C435">iii.</span>Potatoes and maize created unprecedented population growth wherever they were planted. The repercussions of this would be felt for centuries with devastating impacts to traditional societies like China.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>DISEASES RESULTING FROM THE COLUMBIAN EXCHANGE</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The greatest effect on the people of the Americas was the introduction of diseases that had not existed in the Western hemisphere before the arrival of the Europeans.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Smallpox, in particular, eradicated whole villages of native people, creating a demographic catastrophe that has not been equaled in recorded history.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>About 90% of the population of the Americas died from these newly-introduced diseases. This de-population created huge open spaces for Europeans to conquer and settle with little resistance.</p>

<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>EUROPEANS CREATED NEW TRADING POSTS IN AFRICA AND ASIA</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Portugal was particularly active in creating a global trading-post empire.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>On Africa’s north coast, it captured the port of Ceuta, which became a jumping-off point for continued port-grabbing on Africa’s Atlantic coast. From there, they sailed south and negotiated trade deals with West African kingdoms, like Songhai, usually with military threats.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>Portugal colonized South Africa and continued east into the Indian Ocean, taking over Swahili Coast ports.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C435">iii.</span>Portugal then conquered Hormuz on the Persian Gulf, Goa on the southwest coast of India, and Malacca in Southeast Asia, leading some to call the Indian Ocean a “Portuguese lake.”</p>
<p class="C423"><span id="page_58"/>2<span class="C349">.</span>The Netherlands followed and seized many holdings from Portugal, notably South Africa and what is Indonesia today. Vast European holdings in Africa and Asia became known as “trading post empires.”</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Despite the introduction of Europeans to the Indian Ocean network, trade continued largely as before. Swahili Arabs on the East African coast, Gujaratis merchants on the West Indian coast, and Javanese merchants in Southeast Asia (just to name a few) remained dominant in that region.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>The main difference between European holdings in Africa and Asia and the Americas is that whole continents were conquered in the Americas, but trading outposts were the norm in Africa and Asia.</p>
<p class="C423">5<span class="C349">.</span>African and Asian opposition was stronger than in the Americas.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>The widespread diseases that brought substantial population loss to the Native American population squelched any chance for significant resistance.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>In Japan, the Tokugawa Shogunate restricted European trading ships to just one a year through one designated point on an island in Nagasaki Bay.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C435">iii.</span>In China, the Ming Dynasty, who at first in the 16th century sought to restrict foreign trade, were content to send silk and porcelain to Europe in exchange for <em>lots</em> of silver from colonies in the Americas. Spanish silver from the Americas was brought to the new Spanish colony of the Philippines for transfer to Chinese markets. In this era, China was the destination for most of the world’s silver. This is sometimes known as the global silver drain. The effects of this transfer of wealth from the New World via Spain to China would change each society, causing Spain to suffer bouts of inflation that would later cripple their economic development. China also underwent social changes as the merchant class rose in power at the expense of the state, a new phenomenon in the Confucian world.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C340">iv.</span>Portugal managed to gain only one port off the coast of China—Macao.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong><span id="page_59"/>B.</strong></span><strong>EUROPEAN STATES ESTABLISHED NEW MARITIME EMPIRES</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The Atlantic World is described by the interaction between the four continents on both sides of the Atlantic: North America, South America, Europe, and Africa. Latin America is, of course, also part of the Atlantic World. Britain, France and, to a lesser extent, The Netherlands (Holland/The Dutch) followed Spain and Portugal in establishing colonies in the New World. All held islands in the Caribbean with sugar plantations and competed with each other in that global market.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>The British, French, and Dutch colonies along the Atlantic coast of North America (i.e., the 13 colonies) were an afterthought. They were not a big economic factor compared to the wealth of metals and sugar coming out of Latin America.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>The biggest economic contribution from the colonies of <em>upper</em> North America—remember, the Caribbean and Mexico are considered part of North America as well—was a species of fish. Cod was enormously popular among people on both sides of the Atlantic. Its presence off the coast of Massachusetts, near Cape Cod, made European monarchs give colonization there a try.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Initially, Spanish explorers were not settlers and few women made the early voyages. Mixed-race children were born out of relationships between Spaniards and Native women. Slowly, European women made the dangerous trip to the New World and European-only families began to form. Thus, a new social hierarchy was created, with skin color being the determining factor in status.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>The American empires that didn’t benefit from the growth of European-based maritime empires were the Aztec (Mexica) in central Mexico and the Inca in northern South America. They collapsed from a combination of internal political conflicts, the destruction of their population from disease, and pressure from Spanish conquistadors.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>SHORTAGE OF LABOR AND SLAVERY IN THE NEW WORLD</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The high mortality rates of natives on sugarcane plantations resulted in a severe shortage of labor.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>Portugal was first among the European nations to enslave Africans along Africa’s Atlantic coast, and haul them to their sugarcane plantations in Brazil.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441"><span id="page_60"/><span class="C441">ii.</span></span>Spain followed suit, transporting Africans bought along the “Slave Coast” in packed ships across the Atlantic (the Middle Passage) to Caribbean sugar plantations.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C435">iii.</span>This form of slavery that involves buying humans was called chattel slavery.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>West African kingdoms continued to trade slaves within Africa and to Arab and Indian Ocean locales.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>Exporting slaves into the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean areas by Muslim Arabs intensified because of the need for labor.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>The Asante and the Kingdom of the Kongo gained power to expand their territory by trading goods such as guns, salt, and animal skins for slaves.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Under the <em>encomienda</em> system, Spanish colonists used Amerindians who survived the disease pandemics for their labor needs. The Spanish crown granted conquistadors and settlers large tracts of land called <em>haciendas</em>, and on them, native laborers worked the land, farming and/or raising cattle or, in the case of Peru working in the world’s largest silver mine at Potosi.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>The Incan <em>mit’a</em> system that required its populations to perform public works service was adapted by the Spanish to become a system of forced labor. Complaints of abuse by church and some government officials in Latin America led the crown in Spain to end these systems by the early 18th century.</p>
<p class="C423">5<span class="C349">.</span>Indentured servants were enlisted when slaves were unavailable, such as in the British colonies of Virginia and Maryland.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>In the British colonies, particularly Virginia and Maryland, an indentured servant of British origin was a “temporary slave” for about seven years. At the end of servitude, an indentured servant was free of obligations to his or her master.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>Thousands migrated to the British colonies as indentured servants and, if they survived, established their own destinies in the New World.</p>

<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>In their zeal to spread the holy word, Catholic missionaries in the Portuguese and Spanish territories held mass baptisms with little religious instruction. Thus, the traditions of the original faiths of the natives continued with Christian beliefs woven in.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Africans were forcibly taken to the Americas as slaves, initially to sugarcane plantations in Brazil and the Caribbean. The massive loss of people out of Africa—mostly men—damaged African demography. With so many men gone, population declined, as did social stability.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Some Europeans (like those from the Spanish-held Canary Islands) were also re-settled to the Americas against their will as colonists and/or indentured servants.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>Latin American society was a blend of European, African, and Native American cultures. Food, faith, family structure, and racial identities were affected by the contacts between these groups over many centuries. This blending and the social structures that emerged in Latin America is often referred to as the <em>sociedad de las castas</em>. This system attempted to create hierarchical distinctions between people in the New World based upon the extent of native or African ancestry. This will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter.</p>

<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span><em>Mercantilism</em> is defined as a government policy to ensure exports exceed imports.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>European monarchs extracted raw materials from the colonies, and then manufactured products from those <span id="page_62"/>materials to sell globally. The reason was to have a positive balance of trade.</p>

<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span> The first global trade network was established.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>Silver from the Americas was traded for Asian spices, silk, porcelain, and other commodities Europeans desired. Japan joined this network because it, too, had silver mines. China and India were buyers of most of the silver.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>The <em>triangle trade</em> system of the Atlantic World is familiar to most AP® World History: Modern students.</p>

The Virginia Colony at Jamestown was founded by a joint-stock company.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>ECONOMICS IN AFRICA AND ASIA</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The era c. 1450—c. 1750 involved more than commerce across the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p class="C423"><span id="page_63"/>2<span class="C349">.</span>In the Indian Ocean region, trade flourished among the traditional participants such as the Swahili Arabs, Omanis, and Gujaritis from East Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>European merchants had to cooperate with local rulers of port cities because they could not dominate this long-standing trade culture on their own. That was one reason Atlantic World trade surpassed that of the Indian Ocean network by the middle of this era.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>Globally, most people remained farmers.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>Many were subsistence farmers, that is, growing enough for their family with a little left over to sell.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>Others harvested a single crop for a landowner for export—the beginnings of commercial farming.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C435">iii.</span>Changes involved the crop being grown because of the influx of new foods from the Americas—corn in China, for example.</p>
<p class="C423">5<span class="C349">.</span>In the late 1500s in West Africa, the sultan of Morocco defeated neighboring Songhai forces to take control of its Trans-Sahara trade routes, and the Songhai Empire collapsed.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>CHANGES IN ASIAN LABOR SYSTEMS</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The inclusion of the New World into the global systems of exchange expanded the world economy.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>This expanded economy impacted the operation of labor systems around the world.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>As a result of increased requirements for goods to trade on the new global market, Russia expanded into Siberia and began to export valuable furs, especially into the newly-rich European market. Peasants were involved in the trapping and processing of the furs. Peasants also farmed large tracts of land owned by Russia’s elite class. Peru’s potato became a staple in Russia’s diet.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>In India, hand-woven cotton products were churned out by crafters for export.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C435">iii.</span>Chinese peasants were involved in silk production.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong><span id="page_64"/>D.</strong></span><strong>ALONG WITH TRADE, RELIGIONS SPREAD TO NEW LANDS</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The surest way to become a global religion is to adapt to local customs. This process of merging various beliefs is called <em>syncretism</em>.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>Christianity, in its Catholic form, syncretized in Latin America. With official sponsorship from both the Church and European rulers, missionaries in Latin America succeeded, but the religion that emerged, after encounters with traditional beliefs, was different. In Mexico, for example, many Christian saints took on the same duties as the pre-colonial gods they replaced. As had been done before Christianity arrived, offerings were made and votive candles lit in prayer asking for divine intercession. In the Caribbean, a mix of indigenous African religions and Christianity merged to produce Vodun, or voodoo.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>Islam spread as it had in the earlier era into sub-Saharan regions, East and Southeast Asia, including parts of the Philippines.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C435">iii.</span>Buddhism continued to spread across Southeast Asia and into parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C340">iv.</span>Hinduism remained the core religion of India.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>People yet to be contacted by Buddhists, Christians, or Muslims continued to practice their indigenous faiths.</p>

<p class="C916">Indigenous people often rejected the influences of outsiders, and slaves resisted the system imposed on them.</p>

These “Maroon societies” were distributed all over the Caribbean and Central America. The largest was in Brazil, had a king, and lasted almost 100 years. It was finally conquered by Portuguese forces at the end of the 17th century.</p>

<p class="C916">As expected, contacts between the New and Old Worlds had profound effects that are still felt today. In this era, many societies changed.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>POLITICAL ELITES</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>European royalty marked friends and relatives with titles of nobility, such as “lord” and “marquis.” These aristocrats claimed privileges that the “lesser” classes only dreamed they could have. With their high status, many nobles also considered themselves to be stewards of the poor and patrons of the arts.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>The new ruling class in Latin America was the Creole elites. Early settlers in the New World who were born in Spain or Portugal were called the <em>Peninsulares</em>, after the Iberian Peninsula. They were at the top of Latin American society and government. Below that on the societal pyramid were the Creoles, i.e., Europeans born in the New World. Over time, as the numbers of Peninsulares faded and the numbers of Creoles increased, the distinction faded as well.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Below the elites in Latin America were various mixed-race peoples, called <em>Mestizos</em>. Essentially, the more European “blood” a person had (or, conveniently, the whiter the skin), the higher they stood on the social ladder. The more Amerindian or African people appeared, the lower they were on the social ladder. This was known as the <em>sociedad de las castas</em> or <em>Casta</em> system.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>In the North American British and French colonies, there was much less mixing of races. The Europeans established themselves at the top of colonial society, but there was a pecking order among the whites, with European indentured servants below the ruling elites, but above Indians and African slaves.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong><span id="page_66"/>B.</strong></span><strong>ECONOMIC ELITES</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>In Europe and the Americas, new economic elites arose from the merchant class. Entrepreneurs successful in global trade were rewarded with financial success and social status.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>In China, merchants had low social status, but enjoyed the benefits of wealth.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>In Asia, outside of China, wealthy merchants were members of the social elite in every major port city in the Indian Ocean network, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>STATE SUPPRESSION</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Typically, governments set policies to limit the rights of various groups.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>In the Americas, slaves had no meaningful rights and few privileges.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>In Europe, Jews were so persecuted that many fled and settled elsewhere, particularly in the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C435">iii.</span>In China, the Manchus defeated the Ming and became the new elite ruling class in the Qing Dynasty. The majority Han people were barred from settling on Manchu land and were required to wear their hair in a “queue” as a sign of submission to the Manchu.</p>
