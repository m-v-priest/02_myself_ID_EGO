<p class="C695"><strong>Tackling the Short-Answer Questions</strong></p>
<p class="C681">After triumphing over the multiple-choice section of the exam, you will move on to conquer the short-answer questions. You will have 40 minutes to answer three out of four questions. Questions 1 and 2 will have stimulus items, such as a map, a historical document or quotes from historians with different points of view on a development in history. You will be asked to respond based on your knowledge of world history and on your ability to use the learning objectives and historical thinking skills you have developed. The short-answer section is worth 20% of the exam.</p>
<p class="C681">Questions 1 and 2 are <strong>required</strong> and will come from the years 1200 to 2001. (See <a href="12_Chapter_4_Unit_1__The_Global_Tap.html#page_31">chapters 4</a>–<a href="20_Chapter_12_Unit_9__Globalization.html#page_121">12</a>). Question 1 will assess your ability to work with a secondary source, such as a historian’s argument, that is connected to a historical event or process. Question 2 will feature a primary source connected to a historical event or process.</p>
<p class="C681">You will then answer <em>either</em> question 3 (from 1200 to 1750 ) or question 4 (from 1750 to 2001). Neither will have a stimulus attached.</p>
<p class="C681">The four main historical periods of AP® World History: Modern will be covered in these four short-answer questions.</p>
<p class="C681">Each short-answer question has 3 parts: a, b, and c. Each part is worth 1 point. It will help the exam grader (and therefore, you) to <strong>label your answers a), b), and c)</strong> and write <em>only</em> the response for that particular part. You don’t need a thesis statement; just address exactly what questions a, b, and c are asking.</p>
<p class="C681">Usually, short-answer questions ask for an <em>explanation</em>. That means you must include the significance or “because ” in your answer. Look at the sample below. The second and third sentences in “a” include an explanation.</p>
<p class="C681">Also, you must write <em>only inside the box</em> that is provided for that question. Graders are not allowed to read anything outside the box. Picture a text box about three-fourths of a page long, with lines for writing. You don’t <span id="page_174"/>have to fill in the whole box as long as you are fully answering the question, but remember, like the DBQ and the long essay, the short-answer questions are scored based on what you get right, and the wrong stuff is ignored. So write! After you finish the short-answer section, you will have a brief break. Then, it’s on to the essays.</p>
<p class="C681">Here is an example of a short-answer question and a good response:</p>
<p class="C681"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p class="C916">Use the excerpt below and your knowledge of world history to answer all parts of the question that follows.</p>
<p class="C1078">“[The soldier] stood upon a little mound,</p>
<p class="C1078">Cast his lethargic eyes around,</p>
<p class="C1078">And said beneath his breath:</p>
<p class="C1078">‘Whatever happens we have got</p>
<p class="C1078">The Maxim Gun, and they have not.’</p>
<p class="C1078">He marked them in their rude advance,</p>
<p class="C1078">He hushed their rebel cheers;</p>
<p class="C1078">With one extremely vulgar glance</p>
<p class="C1078">He broke the Mutineers . . . .</p>
<p class="C1078">We shot and hanged a few, and then</p>
<p class="C1078">The rest became devoted men . . . .</p>
<p class="C1078">While they support us, we should lend</p>
<p class="C1078">Our every effort to defend,</p>
<p class="C1078">And from a higher point of view</p>
<p class="C1078">To give the full direction due</p>
<p class="C1078">To all the native races.”</p>
<p class="C1079">—Hilaire Belloc, British author and politician,<br/> <em>The Modern Traveler</em>, 1898</p>
<p class="C1007"><span class="C1066">a)</span>Briefly explain the historical context of this poem.</p>
<p class="C1007"><span class="C1066">b)</span>Describe and explain ONE specific example of native resistance in Africa to the events depicted in this poem.</p>
<p class="C1007"><span class="C1066">c)</span>Describe and explain ONE specific example of native resistance in Asia to the events depicted in this poem.</p>
<p class="C681"><strong>Sample Response</strong> note that each answer is labeled a, b or c.</p>
<p class="C1007"><span class="C1066">a)</span>The historical context of this poem is 19th century European imperialism of Africa and Asia. Europeans <span id="page_175"/>believed themselves to be superior to natives and felt they had a right to conquer them. Social Darwinism and strong nationalism fueled this attitude.</p>
<p class="C1007"><span class="C1066">b)</span>One example from Africa was when the Zulu warriors attacked British outposts in southern Africa. Even though the Africans won a major battle, the British did not leave the region. This represented the peak of Zulu resistance.</p>
<p class="C1007"><span class="C1066">c)</span>One example from Asia was the Indian Mutiny, or Sepoy Rebellion in the 19th century, when anti-British Indian soldiers fought pro-British Indians and the British army. As in Africa, this rebellion failed to get the British to leave, in this case because Britain had the support of many Indian soldiers.</p>
