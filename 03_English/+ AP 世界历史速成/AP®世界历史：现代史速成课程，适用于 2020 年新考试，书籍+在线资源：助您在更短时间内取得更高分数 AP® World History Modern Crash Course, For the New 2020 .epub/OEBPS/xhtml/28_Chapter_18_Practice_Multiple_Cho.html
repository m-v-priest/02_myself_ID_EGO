<p class="C997">The Mongols persisted in their goal of conquering the whole world as if they were one man but they are millions in number. They attack suddenly, and make such horrible slaughters that the king cannot find enough people to wage battle against them. They fight constantly with javelins, bows and arrows, battle axes, maces, and swords. They trick all people and princes in time of peace, pretending to want to help but really to learn weaknesses and to find enough fertile ground to feed their huge multitudes. In this way they have deceived foolish rulers who granted the Mongols passage through their territories, which resulted in the ruin and destruction of the rulers and their lands.</p>
<p class="C685">From a 16th century English translation<br/>
of a 13th century Russian description<br/>
of Mongol characteristics</p>
<p class="C1001"><strong><span id="page_156"/>1<span class="C441">.</span></strong> Modern historians would most likely consider this description of the Mongols to be</p>
<p class="C1007">(<span class="C441">A)</span>accurate because the translation was written during the era of Mongol conquests</p>
<p class="C1007">(<span class="C441">B)</span>balanced because the original author considered the Mongol point of view based on primary documents</p>
<p class="C1007">(<span class="C441">C)</span>questionable because the original author was from Russia, a region conquered by Mongols</p>
<p class="C1007">(<span class="C441">D)</span>inaccurate because the Mongol written language was not translated by Western scholars until the 20th century</p>
<p class="C1001"><strong>2<span class="C441">.</span></strong>The Mongol empire compared to other empires in history in what way?</p>
<p class="C1007">(<span class="C441">A)</span>It was the largest land empire of all time.</p>
<p class="C1007">(<span class="C441">B)</span>It was about the size of the Holy Roman Empire.</p>
<p class="C1007">(<span class="C441">C)</span>It lasted almost as long as the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p class="C1007">(<span class="C441">D)</span>It used its naval military forces to create a Pacific Ocean empire.</p>
<p class="C1001"><strong>3<span class="C441">.</span></strong>According to most modern historians, in which of the following ways were the Mongols indirectly responsible for the spread of the pandemic plague in the 14th century?</p>
<p class="C1007">(<span class="C441">A)</span>Mongols released plague-infected rats into cities to weaken them.</p>
<p class="C1007">(<span class="C441">B)</span>Mongol intermarriage with local conquered people led to the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
<p class="C1007">(<span class="C441">C)</span>The decline of Mongol influence in the 14th century resulted in inadequate medical care in Eurasia.</p>
<p class="C1007">(<span class="C441">D)</span>Extensive trade routes protected by Mongols led to increased exchange of goods, technology, and disease.</p>

<p class="C997">We live in an age of Enlightenment. The motto of the Enlightenment should be, “Have courage to use your own understanding!” A prince should allow his people complete freedom of religion, and if he does, he should be praised by all. Rulers should also favor freedom in the arts and sciences and allow his subjects to create better ways to draw up laws. Once men are free to think for themselves, they will increasingly be able to act freely. Eventually, even the principles of government will benefit by treating people with dignity.</p>

<p class="C997">Another of their good qualities is their habit of wearing clean white garments on Fridays. Even if a man has nothing but an old worn shirt, he washes it and cleans it, and wears it to the Friday service. Yet another is their zeal for learning the Quran by heart. They put their children in chains if they show any backwardness in memorizing it, and they are not set free until they have it by heart.</p>
<p class="C997">Among their bad qualities are the following. Women go into the sultan’s presence naked and without coverings, and his daughters also go about naked. Then there is their custom of putting dust and ashes on their heads, as a mark of respect, and other grotesque ceremonies. Another disgusting practice among many of them is the eating of dogs.</p>

<p class="C997">“The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. . . . It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom—Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation....The bourgeoisie . . . has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage laborers. . . . The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation.”</p>

<p class="C307"><strong><span id="page_168"/>ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C1042"><strong>1<span class="C1046">.</span>(C)</strong> The original Russian author’s point of view was likely swayed in his opinions about the Mongols by stories of their conquest of his land. The translation to English (A) was written centuries after Mongol conquests. There is no evidence the original author was granted access by the Mongols to their documents (B). Contrary to the assertion in Choice (D), the Mongol written language was known to Westerners at least by Marco Polo’s time (early 14th century).</p>
<p class="C1042"><strong>2<span class="C1046">.</span>(A)</strong> The Mongol empire was much larger than the Holy Roman Empire (B). It lasted about 200 years, while the Ottoman Empire lasted about 700 years (C). The Mongols failed in their attempts to invade Japan by sea, ending any thoughts of expansion further into the Pacific (D).</p>
<p class="C1042"><strong>3<span class="C1046">.</span>(D)</strong> Trade increased during the Age of the Mongols, and with trade came diseases, most notably the Black Death, which struck from China all the way to Europe because of trade routes. There is no historical basis for Choices (A) or (B). In addition, at no time in the 14th century was the medical community equipped to deal with the Black Death (C).</p>
<p class="C1042"><strong>4<span class="C1046">.</span>(A)</strong> The Reformation preceded the Enlightenment.</p>
<p class="C1042"><strong>5<span class="C1046">.</span>(C)</strong> The movement to end slavery was implemented in European colonies and spread to nations in the Americas. The other choices can be considered Enlightenment-inspired reforms, but none is abolitionism.</p>
<p class="C1042"><strong>6<span class="C1046">.</span>(B)</strong> Decolonization movements of the 20th century were sparked by nationalist fervor derived from Enlightenment concepts that had inspired nationalist movements in the 19th century. “Bollywood” movies were more a result of technology and the spread of American Hollywood movies (A). Fascism was highly nationalist politically, but its ideals were far removed from Enlightenment philosophy (C). The movement to restore some faiths to their basic teachings (D) was in some sense a response to some cultural outcomes of the Enlightenment, but not as directly as decolonization.</p>
<p class="C1042"><strong><span id="page_169"/>7<span class="C1046">.</span>(A)</strong> World historians call this and similar blending of tradition syncretism. <em>Global migration</em> involves the moving of people, but not necessarily the blending of their cultures (B). <em>Nationalism</em> is pride in one’s country and/or cultural heritage (C). <em>Theocracy</em> is government run under religious guidelines (D).</p>
<p class="C1042"><strong>8<span class="C1046">.</span>(C)</strong> Catholicism in Latin America strongly featured syncretism with indigenous beliefs. Mahayana Buddhism was more syncretic than Theravada Buddhism (A). Once established, Judaism incorporated little from nearby religions (B), especially compared to Catholicism in Latin America. Daoism is part of Chinese culture, not Russian (D).</p>
<p class="C1042"><strong>9<span class="C1046">.</span>(D)</strong> Choice (A) is incorrect because the era of European imperialism in Africa was the 19th century. Choice (B) is incorrect because such alliances did not exist with Spain at that time. And Choice (C) is incorrect because no such government programs existed on a large scale.</p>
