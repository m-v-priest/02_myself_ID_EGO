<p class="C695"><strong>Strategies for the Multiple-Choice Questions</strong></p>
<p class="C681">The AP® World History: Modern exam begins with a 55-question, 55-minute multiple-choice section that is worth 40% of your total grade. Although the AP® World History: Modern Course and Exam Description says that the course runs “to the present,” the reality is that the exam creators know that most teachers won’t get much past the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s. So the test writers tend not to ask many questions beyond that date. So be sure to do a quick review of the highlights of the post–Cold War era if your class didn’t get there by early May.</p>
<p class="C681">In addition, looking at the early chapters of this book, you’ll see that the exam questions are divided into four time frames: c. 1200–c. 1450, c. 1450–c. 1750, c. 1750–c. 1900, and c. 1900 to the present. The era c. 1200–c. 1450 is worth 16% to 20% of the exam. Each of the other eras accounts for 24% to 30% of the exam. So, there should be around ten multiple-choice questions from 1200<strong>–</strong>1450. Remember: that era also includes the background material about the origins of major belief systems. Each of the later three units should have thirteen to seventeen multiple-choice questions. In other words, there are no eras you can take lightly, and it also means the last 100+ years are as important as the 300 years from 1450 to 1750.</p>
<p class="C681">Some multiple-choice questions are comparative. That is, you are asked to compare societies in different time periods. It’s important to understand that the AP® World History: Modern exam is all about comparisons across time and place—getting the big picture and making connections. Many multiple-choice questions will involve only one time period. Some multiple-choice questions will feel like “gimmes,” while others will be brain-rattling hard. That’s to be expected. Hardly anyone ever gets all the multiple-choice questions right, so even if you miss 15 or 20, you’re still doing better than most.</p>
<p class="C681">What you <em>won’t</em> find on the AP® World History: Modern exam are “recall” multiple-choice questions. Here’s an example:</p>
<p class="P2071"><span id="page_154"/>The Tang Empire was in</p>
<p class="P207"><span class="C340">(A)</span> China</p>
<p class="P207"><span class="C340">(B)</span> Mesoamerica</p>
<p class="P207"><span class="C340">(C)</span> India</p>
<p class="P207"><span class="C340">(D)</span> Europe</p>
<p class="C681">By the way, the answer is choice (A). Instead, what you will find are sets of 3 to 4 questions that are anchored to some type of stimulus, such as a document, chart, map, or art. Some of the multiple-choice questions will be more directly connected to the stimulus than others. Look below for some examples.</p>
<p class="C681">To answer 55 questions in 55 minutes means you get 60 seconds to answer each question. Math is so easy! That might not sound like a lot of time, but with practice, you’ll find that it is. Study the stimulus first, so you know generally what the answer choices that follow will cover.</p>
<p class="C681">The best way to deal with fears of running out of time is to first answer all the multiple-choice questions that seem easy to you. When you get to the end of the multiple-choice section, go back and spend time on the ones you didn’t answer during the first run-through. When the exam proctor calls “Time!,” that’s it. You can’t return later and finish the multiple-choice section.</p>

<div class="C903">
<p class="C1142"><em><strong>Keep in mind, especially if you or your teacher use multiple-choice questions from previous exams or older exam study guides for practice, that the exam begins c. 1200 and questions will be in sets linked to a document or image.</strong></em></p>
</div>
<p class="C681">The multiple-choice questions should generally run in chronological order. That means the first questions should come from the earliest time periods and continue chronologically “to the present.”</p>
<p class="C681">Answer all of the questions. Don’t skip even one. If you have no idea, guess. Even if you have 10 questions to go and 30 seconds left, bubble in those ovals on the answer sheet. You have a 25% chance of getting each guess right, and that’s a lot better than skipping a question and having a 0% chance.</p>
<p class="C681">Don’t be discouraged if you “feel” like you missed too many multiple-choice questions. You can get about 20 of them wrong and still be in the “3” range headed into your short-answer and essay questions.</p>
