<p class="C1191"><strong>c. 1900 to the Present</strong></p>
<p class="C916">The United Nations (UN) replaced the League of Nations after World War II. Two key differences stood out: the UN’s headquarters was in the U.S., not Europe—a sign of America’s postwar influence—and, unlike the League, the UN had military power it could use to stop aggression by nations.</p>
<p class="C916">Western Europe’s reign as the world’s strongest economic and political force ended with World War II. Two devastating wars crippled Europe, while the U.S. was the only major power whose economy and society remained strong. One by one, aided by the UN, Europe’s colonies in Africa and Asia gained independence.</p>

<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The Yalta Conference. Near the end of the World War II, the Allies met to redraw the maps of Europe and Asia for the postwar world. Germany and its capital, Berlin, were divided into Western and Soviet regions. The USSR took control of most of Eastern Europe, promising those countries self-determination. When that pledge failed to materialize, the West discounted Soviet guarantees and intentions, and, as the world’s only communist nation in 1945, the USSR suspected its old allies were out to destroy it.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>The Yalta Conference also divided Korea into communist north and capitalist south nations. Japan was put into the U.S. sphere of influence. The U.S. replaced Japan’s government with a democratic constitutional monarchy.</p>

<p class="C916">If anything approached “World War III,” it was the Cold War. The capitalist U.S. and its Western allies competed with the communist USSR and its allies for global superiority. What made it a “cold” war was that the main antagonists did not fight each other directly on a battlefield. However, everything else involved in a “hot” war was in play: threats of destruction, the gathering of military allies, arms build-ups, spy networks, and propaganda campaigns. Even the exploration of space and Olympic competitions were part of the Cold War. The addition of nuclear weapons made the outcome of any such war extremely hazardous to the entire world.</p>
<p class="C916">Some early events in the Cold War included:</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>THE BERLIN AIRLIFT</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>In 1946, the USSR attempted to cut off Western access to Berlin, which was in Soviet-controlled East Germany. For a year, the U.S. and Britain flew supplies into the Western sector of Berlin. The Soviets realized the futility of their blockade and lifted it. This event increased Cold War tensions between the two sides. In 1961, communist East Germany built a wall dividing the pro-West sector of Berlin from its communist half. The Berlin Wall was finally torn down in 1989.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE MARSHALL PLAN</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>To help its Western European allies recover from the war, the U.S. sent billions of dollars in economic and construction aid to West Germany, Britain, France, and other nations. Japan also received massive amounts of reconstruction assistance. The USSR provided a similar but less successful aid package for Eastern Europe called Comecon.</p>

<p class="C933">This disturbed the Western allies, but the Soviet Union claimed they were for self-defense.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>NATO vs. THE WARSAW PACT</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>In 1949, the U.S. formed an alliance with Western European nations designed to deter Soviet aggression in Europe. Canada and Turkey were included. The USSR responded with a military alliance of its own, the Warsaw Pact, which included most Eastern European nations. For decades, most experts assumed World War III would be fought in Central Europe between these two sides.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>CHINESE COMMUNIST LEADER MAO ZEDONG SEIZED CONTROL OF CHINA IN 1949</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The 20th century Chinese Revolutions and China’s Cold War relationship with the USSR and the West are discussed later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>LATIN AMERICA</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Cold War tensions peaked during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. Cuba became a communist nation in 1959, and the USSR secretly placed missiles with nuclear capabilities there. The U.S. discovered the missiles and brought the issue to the UN. Before a nuclear exchange of missiles occurred, cooler heads prevailed. In Central America in the late 1970s and early 1980s, guerilla wars between pro- and anti-communist forces involved U.S. and Soviet funding, weapons, and “advisors.”</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>E.</strong></span><strong>NON-ALIGNED NATIONS</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Most nations sided with either the U.S. or the USSR. This political reality was called “Bi-Polarism.” However, some nations claimed not to pick sides and called themselves the Non-Aligned Nations. Key members of the non-aligned group were Indonesia and its leader, Sukarno, India and its leader, Nehru, <span id="page_114"/>Kenya and its leader, Nkrumah, and Yugoslavia and its leader, Tito.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>F.</strong></span><strong>PROXY WARS</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The main Cold War powers—the U.S. and the USSR—fought “proxy wars” in third world countries to spread their ideologies. In these wars the two superpowers did not fight each other directly, but provided materiel and funding to pro- and anticommunist regimes. Examples include Korea and Vietnam and Angola.</p>

<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>REVOLUTIONS IN CHINA LED TO COMMUNIST RULE</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The Qing dynasty ended in 1911 and was not replaced by a new imperial dynasty. This event marked the end of thousands of years of dynastic rule in China.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>The new government was the Republic of China, promoted by Sun Yat-sen (Sun Yi Xian), a Western-educated member of the Chinese elite. Sun struggled to create a stable, unified China and accepted foreign aid, especially from the new Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Sun died in 1925 and was replaced by Chiang Kai-Shek (Jiang Jieshí). Unlike Sun, Chiang vigorously opposed cooperation with communists. Under Chiang, the Nationalist-led republic was perceived as massively corrupt and had little support among the peasants. Regions in China fell into civil war between communists and Nationalists supporting the Republic.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>When Japan invaded China in 1937, the communists and Nationalists united to fight their common enemy. At the end of World War II, China’s civil war restarted and, in 1949, the communists, led by Mao Zedong, won. The Nationalist government, still supported by Western powers, fled to Taiwan, an island nation near mainland China.</p>
<p class="C423">5<span class="C349">.</span>Mao’s government officially granted full rights to women, which was a radical departure from China’s history.</p>
<p class="C423">6<span class="C349">.</span>China supported North Korea in the Korean War, sending millions of soldiers into battle.</p>
<p class="C423"><span id="page_115"/>7<span class="C349">.</span>In the late 1950s, Mao pushed a “Great Leap Forward” program that promoted industrial output over agricultural production. The result was a catastrophe that killed as many as 20 million people by starvation. Mao’s response was to blame capitalist influences that allegedly remained in China. So the “Cultural Revolution” was enacted to purge all vestiges of Western culture. A decade of government persecutions and reeducation centers finally ended with Mao’s death in 1976.</p>
<p class="C423">8<span class="C349">.</span>By the 1960s, two nations that might appear to be natural allies were enemies: the USSR and communist China. They fought over territories on their mutual borders and did little to support each other in spreading communism around the globe.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE KOREAN WAR</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>At the end of World War II, the USSR and the U.S. agreed to divide Korea into a communist north and pro-West south. In 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea and, for the first time, the UN sent soldiers from member nations to push out the aggressor. The U.S. led the UN forces that included a massive surge from communist Chinese soldiers into Korea. After three years, the boundaries of the two Koreas were established near their previous borders. The U.S. and its military allies announced a global plan of “containment” designed to keep communism from spreading beyond its 1950 borders.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>THE VIETNAM WAR</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Just after World War II, a war for independence in French colonial Indochina became a Cold War battle for that region. It was divided in the early 1950s into four nations, including pro-communist North Vietnam—led by Ho Chi Min—and pro-West South Vietnam. Much like in Korea, North Vietnam soon invaded South Vietnam to unify the country under communist rule. Vietnam became the focus of U.S. containment policy. The U.S. committed its army to fighting a limited war until the communists of North Vietnam defeated and absorbed South Vietnam in 1975. Hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese migrated to France, Australia, and the U.S. over the next two decades.</p>

<p class="C933">Europe was weakened after two world wars. Europe’s decline as a world power was typified by successful colonial independence movements after World War II. Some colonies gained independence peacefully, others by violent revolutions. By the mid-1970s, almost all former European colonies returned to local control. Decolonization became one of the major themes of the 20th century.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>ASIA</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The first major colony to gain independence after World War II was also the largest. Mohandas Gandhi led non-violent resistance to the British <em>raj</em> for decades, supported by the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League. Their efforts were successful in 1947, but Gandhi’s dream of a united, independent India was not fulfilled. In South Asia, the Muslim League used religion as an additional factor in seeking independence. Muslim-majority areas, such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, formed separate nations in what was known as the Partition of India. However, ethnic violence occurred after independence when Hindus and Muslims clashed near the India-Pakistan border and an estimated one million died.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>The Dutch East Indies and Indochina represent two colonies that rebelled violently for independence. The Netherlands granted independence to the new nation of Indonesia in 1965. As discussed earlier, France granted independence after Indochina split into four nations: Laos, Cambodia, and North and South Vietnam.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Hong Kong did not gain independence, but the British peacefully transferred sovereignty of Hong Kong—which it had held since the Opium Wars—to communist China in 1997 on the promise that the island would remain a capitalist haven.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>AFRICA</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>North African nations tended to gain independence from European control earlier than sub-Saharan nations. In the 1950s, the UN supported the peaceful independence of Libya and Tunisia from French rule. The most significant rebellion in North Africa occurred in Algeria, where French soldiers battled nationalist rebels until France granted independence in 1962.</p>
<p class="C423"><span id="page_117"/>2<span class="C349">.</span>Ghana was the first sub-Saharan colony to gain independence, peacefully, in 1957. However, in Angola, rebels aided by the USSR, China, and Cuba, fought against Portuguese rule until becoming independent in 1975. Most other African colonies gained freedom through peaceful means and with support from the UN.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>LATIN AMERICA</strong></p>
<p class="C933">In Latin America, Europe’s few colonies gained independence in the postwar era as well. The Bahamas and the Guiana colonies in South America are two examples.</p>

<p class="C916">Some former colonies had economic success and political stability after decolonization, including India, Singapore, and Indonesia. However, many colonies struggled, facing civil wars, crumbling infrastructure, and continued economic dependence on their old colonial rulers.</p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Malawi and Zaire are two examples in Africa of the latter, but there are many more. A continuity over the centuries has been Africa’s lack of industrial production. It remains an exporter primarily of natural resources such as oil, gold, and other minerals.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>Palestine/Israel. After World War I, Britain had a mandate over Palestine that lasted just after World War II. In 1947, the UN called for a partition of Palestine into Jewish-majority and Arab-majority states. A year later, the U.S. recognized the state of Israel, but the Palestinian question remained unresolved.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>Some newly independent states in Asia and Africa used their governments to direct economic modernization, with mixed results. India’s prime minister Indira Gandhi enacted emergency powers to, she claimed, end poverty there. Egypt’s government funded flood control of the Nile River, nationalized (government control of) about half of the country’s businesses, but most Egyptians remained in poverty.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C435">iii.</span>Perhaps because of slow economic and social progress in the new nations, many people from Asia and Africa migrated to their former colonial countries. Pakistanis and Indians moved <span id="page_118"/>to Britain in large numbers; Algerians flocked to France and Filipinos migrated to the U.S., which had colonized the Philippines for fifty years.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C519">iv.</span>Massive internal migration in the new nations in Africa and Asia led to mega-cities like Lagos, Nigeria (population: 21 million) and Karachi, Pakistan (population: 15 million).</p>

<p class="C933">South Africa was part of the British Empire, but wasn’t a colony per se. It became an independent country in 1910, but retained strong political and economic ties to Britain, like Canada and Australia. South Africa had a long-standing policy of white minority rule: <em>apartheid</em>. Whites of Dutch, German, and British descent had full political rights, but the majority black population and mixed-race peoples had none for most of the 20th century. A movement demanding majority rule, led by Nelson Mandela, eventually forced the government to yield to increasing international pressure and transitioned to constitutional rights for all citizens, regardless of color, in the 1990s.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>END OF SEGREGATION IN THE U.S.</strong></p>
<p class="C933">Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was inspired by Mohandas Gandhi’s non-violent passive resistance campaigns in India, and used similar methods to call for economic and social justice in the U.S. Racial violence flared in many cities from the 1950s to early 1970s, but his goals of fair treatment in jobs, housing, and voting were largely achieved.</p>

<p class="C933">The USSR’s military rivaled that of the U.S., but at home, consumer goods were either hard to find or of poor quality. The Soviet Union was mired in a costly war in Afghanistan. After 1980, U.S. President Ronald Reagan increased military spending, gambling that the Soviets would choose to do the same and ignore calls for improved goods and services at home. They did.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>IN THE MID-1980s THE REFORMER MIKHAIL GORBACHEV WAS BROUGHT TO POWER IN THE USSR</strong></p>
<p class="C933">Gorbachev proposed introducing limited capitalism and loosening restrictions on criticism of the government. He thought these measures, if doled out in a controlled fashion, would restore the crumbling economy and people’s faith in the communist system. It did neither. The world was amazed as former Soviet-controlled nations in Eastern Europe peacefully broke with communism in the late 1980s with nary a peep from Gorbachev.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>C.</strong></span>In 1991, Gorbachev announced the break-up of the USSR. Russia became—on paper at least—a capitalist-based democracy, but over time, authoritarianism regained a foothold under the leadership of Vladimir Putin<strong>.</strong></p>

<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Nuclear legacy. The enormous destructive power of nuclear bombs may well have been the deciding factor as to why the Cold War did not turn “hot.” The major rivals may have avoided using nuclear weapons, but after the Cold War, many nations developed or tried to build their own nuclear arsenal. Few responded positively to calls from the U.S., the former USSR, or the UN to curtail their nuclear programs. India, Pakistan, and Iran are some examples.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>CAUSES OF DECOLONIZATION</strong></p>
<p class="C933">The weakened state of colonial powers after two world wars gave the colonies an opportunity to break away, but other factors were involved:</p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>A major purpose of the UN was to promote self-determination for peoples. By the end of the 20th century, almost every colony that wanted to, had attained self-rule.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Strong nationalist feelings in the colonies promoted a sense of destiny among leaders of independence movements. For example, the peoples in Indo-China drew on their national identities to outlast French and U.S. efforts to maintain the status quo.</p>
