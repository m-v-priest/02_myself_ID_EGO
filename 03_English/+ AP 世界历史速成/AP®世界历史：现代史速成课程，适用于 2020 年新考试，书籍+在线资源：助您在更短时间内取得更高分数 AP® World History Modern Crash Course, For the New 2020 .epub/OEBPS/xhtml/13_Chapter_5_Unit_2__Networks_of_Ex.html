<p class="C1191"><strong>c. 1200 to c. 1450</strong></p>
<p class="C681">Connected to the political and religious processes c. 1200–c.1450 are the economic and social changes and continuities in the world. But you will discover politics, religions, and philosophies here too. This is a good reminder of the constant overlapping of historical events and trends that make AP® World History: Modern special. As you proceed through this book, remember to continually apply the AP® skills: Comparison (similarities and differences), Continuity-and-Change-over-Time, and Causes and Effects. As you review these chapters, think, “How is this similar or different from another society?” “What caused this?” “What are some of its effects?” “What things are changing?” “What things are staying much the same?”</p>

<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The Silk Roads existed long before 1200, but were longer and busier than ever, running from Korea to the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>The increase in trade that took place along the Silk Roads led to stopping points (called <em>caravanserai</em>) along the routes. Some caravanserai developed into cities that expanded in importance in this era. Samarkand and Dunhuang are two examples of Silk Road trade cities.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>These cities were centers for exchanging goods like silk textiles, porcelain and tea from China, amber from the Black Sea region, carpets and musical instruments from Central Asia, spices from South and Southeast Asia, and the gold and silver from faraway Europe.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>Technology and other ideas were also exchanged, such as gunpowder, paper, and the compass from China, and Arabic numerals from South Asia.</p>
<p class="C430"><span id="page_40"/><span class="C435">iii.</span>Merchants and missionaries spread Islam, Buddhism, and Christianity as well as other faiths along trade routes.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>NEW FORMS OF MONEY AND CREDIT</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Banks grew along the Silk Roads. They provided bills of exchange (like today’s bank-issued checks) to protect merchants’ money.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>China’s exports were so strong, paper money (“flying cash”) was introduced as currency due to a shortage of metal for coins. The innovation grew in popularity along the Silk Roads after the Mongols conquered China.</p>

<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>FROM THE 13th TO THE 15th CENTURIES, MONGOL RULE STRETCHED FROM EAST ASIA TO EASTERN EUROPE</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The Mongols were pastoralists—nomads from Mongolia who herded sheep, yaks, goats, cattle, and, most importantly, horses. In the early 13th century, led by Chinggis (Genghis) Khan, the Mongols swept south into China, eventually reaching—and ending—the Song Dynasty.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>After merciless military campaigns that brought them to power, the Mongols in China made Beijing their capital and ended the Confucian examination system. The Mongols allowed foreigners, especially Arab Muslims, to administer the government.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Chinggis’s grandson, Kublai Khan, established the Yuan Dynasty in China, which lasted until 1368, when rebellions drove the Mongols back to their homeland on the steppes of Mongolia.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>THE PAX MONGOLICA</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The Mongols accumulated goods from all over the world, so they made the Silk Road network as safe for merchants as possible. The routes were so free of bandits that historians refer to a Pax Mongolica (“Mongol peace”).</p>
<p class="C423"><span id="page_41"/>2<span class="C349">.</span>The Pax Mongolica came at a high price: cities that opposed the Mongols disappeared from the map; Baghdad’s leaders resisted Mongol attacks in 1258 and 200,000 people died. The Abbasid Empire died with them. Central Asia lost as many as three-quarters of its population to Mongol destruction. It is estimated that China’s population declined by half during the Yuan Dynasty.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>C.</strong></span><strong>MONGOL EXPANSION</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Through conquest, the Mongol Empire grew so quickly that one leader could not oversee it all. The Empire divided into regional <em>khanates</em> after Chinggis died, and these khanates reached to eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Southwest Asia.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>The Mongols’ advance westward was finally stopped in modern-day Israel by Mamluk warriors from Egypt.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>The Russians called the Mongols “The Golden Horde.” After their destructive invasion, the Mongols reached an agreement with local Russian leaders who collected tribute to send to their Mongol masters. This tribute arrangement lasted 200 years until Ivan the Great, prince of Moscow, led a successful revolt against the Mongols in 1480.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>The Mongols established a tribute system of trade with Korea, but failed twice to invade Japan by sea.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>D.</strong></span><strong>EFFECTS OF THE MONGOLS</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Over time, the people in all Mongol khanates rebelled and ended their rule. But the Mongol legacy, the largest empire the world has ever seen, remained. They allowed freedom of religion in the areas they conquered. Technology and other innovations spread through the Mongol Empire and beyond: saddle stirrups, the compound bow, flying cash, and pasta, to name a few.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Marco Polo returned to Italy from a long visit to China under Kublai Khan with noodle-making technology and enticing tales that inspired future generations of European explorers. However, because of the Pax Mongolica, increased trade resulted in the rapid spread of the Black Death all across the khanates and into western Europe. Mongols in Persia even settled down to become farmers!</p>

<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>A.</strong></span><strong>EXPANSION OF INTERREGIONAL TRADE</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>Similar to the Silk Roads, the Indian Ocean trade network was just as important but with routes over water.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Ships carried heavier bulk items (lumber and pottery) than could be conveyed on the Silk Roads. Bananas and citrus trees from Southeast Asia were cultivated in Africa and around the Mediterranean region. African, Arab, Southeast Asian, and Chinese (just to name a few!) merchants also carried religion (especially Buddhism and Islam) and exchanged silver, cotton, spices, porcelain, and many other items across the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>Seasonal monsoon winds aided sailing ships in the Indian Ocean. Merchants entered Southeast Asia, crossing the Indian Ocean into South Asia, East Africa, and the Middle East (which is part of Southwest Asia).</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>China ruled the seas from East Africa to East Asia. Chinese emperors usually let the Indian Ocean merchants manage their own affairs. Therefore, the Indian Ocean system of exchange was mostly self-governing. Merchants made the rules, worked their best deals for access to ports, kept smugglers (pirates) at bay, and established prices.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C435">iii.</span>The introduction of the compass, the astrolabe, and larger ships made trade safer and profitable.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C340">iv.</span>History’s greatest maritime expeditions passed through the Indian Ocean. In the early 15th century, the Ming Dynasty sent a huge fleet to the Indian Ocean led by Chinese Muslim Admiral Zheng He for an official look at its sea-trading partners. His seven voyages on 400-foot-long “treasure ships” displayed China’s vast wealth, technology, and power.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong>B.</strong></span><strong>INDIAN OCEAN TRADE AND GROWTH OF STATES</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The Islamic Sultanate of Malacca, in Southeast Asia, was a major player in Indian Ocean trade. It patrolled the vital Straits of Malacca (a route from China to the Indian Ocean) for pirates.</p>
<p class="C423"><span id="page_43"/>2<span class="C349">.</span>In western India, the port of Gujarat, under Islamic control, was a trade center midway between Africa and East Asia.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Muslims also controlled the trading centers on the Swahili Coast of East Africa. Cities such as Kilwa, Lamu, and Zanzibar welcomed various merchants from Europe, the Arabian Peninsula, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia.</p>
<p class="C423">4<span class="C349">.</span>All this merchant activity meant there were sizable diasporic communities scattered all over Afro-Eurasia, especially Arabs and Persians in East Africa, Chinese in Southeast Asia (like Burma and modern-day Indonesia) and Malays in South Asia.</p>
<p class="C423">5<span class="C349">.</span>Jewish and Christian merchants also participated in the Indian Ocean network and established communities throughout the region.</p>

<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>South of the “rim” of Mediterranean North Africa lies the Sahara Desert. Merchants there exchanged items from the coast such as cotton, dates, and leather goods for gold, salt, ivory, animal hides, and slaves, connecting to the Silk Road network.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Camels were introduced to the Sahara from the Middle East centuries before 1200.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>Camels became the main means to transport goods, greatly increasing trade between West Africa and Southwest Asia.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>The camel saddle and use of camel caravans encouraged trade across the Sahara, into Southwest Asia, all the way to China and Korea.</p>
<p class="C423">3<span class="C349">.</span>Islam was introduced into the region in the eighth century along the trans-Sahara trade routes, just as Buddhism had earlier spread into East and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p class="C335"><span class="C340"><strong><span id="page_44"/>B.</strong></span><strong>WEST AFRICAN KINGDOMS IN TRANS-SAHARAN TRADE</strong></p>
<p class="C423">1<span class="C349">.</span>The Muslim West African kingdom of Mali increased Afro-Eurasian trade, exchanging its gold and animal skins for goods from beyond its borders, including salt.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C391">i.</span>Its capital, Timbuktu, was a major trade, religious, and educational center.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C441">ii.</span>Mali’s king Mansa Musa made a famous pilgrimage to the Islamic holy city, Mecca.</p>
<p class="C430"><span class="C340">iii.</span>Famous Muslim traveler, Ibn Battuta recorded a visit to Mali (and the Swahili Coast, Central, South, Southeast and East Asia) in the 14th century.</p>
<p class="C423">2<span class="C349">.</span>Songhai, a similar empire, appeared late in this era and competed with Mali for trade dominance. The trade center Gao was its capital.</p>

For example: “Analyze the extent to which the kinds of goods exchanged were similar in the Indian Ocean and the Trans-Saharan trade routes.” Or, “To what extent did networks of exchange in the era c. 1200 to c. 1450 foster change in local economies?”</p>
