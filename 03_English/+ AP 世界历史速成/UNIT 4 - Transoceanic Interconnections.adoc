== 释义

=== I. TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS 技术创新

Benefits to Europe from trade with Asia by the end of the previous era included not only spices and other commodities, but also technology. The compass, more accurate maps, the astrolabe (used to determine latitude), and improved rudders and sails—all transferred from Asia—contributed to Europe’s ability to make long-distance sailing expeditions.

[.my2]
前一时代末期，欧洲从与亚洲的贸易中获益匪浅，不仅包括香料和其他商品，还包括技术。指南针、更精确的地图、星盘（用于确定纬度）以及改进的舵和帆——所有这些都从亚洲传入——提高了欧洲进行远洋航行的能力。

Portuguese shipbuilders introduced the caravel, based on Islamic designs, to explore Africa’s Atlantic coast in the 15th century.

[.my2]
15 世纪，葡萄牙造船商根据伊斯兰设计，将"卡拉维尔帆船"引入非洲大西洋沿岸进行探索。

The introduction of the lateen sail (shaped like a triangle) around 1500 made ships more maneuverable, allowing them to tack, or sail, against the wind and thus extend their voyages into the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean from the Mediterranean Sea.

[.my2]
大约在 1500 年，三角帆（形状像三角形）的引入, 使船只更加灵活，使它们能够逆风航行，从而将航行范围, 从地中海扩展到印度洋和大西洋。

B.A “Scientific Revolution” transformed European approaches to science—from haphazard methods to more logical experimentation, concepts picked up from indirect contact with Muslim and Chinese scholars. The telescope, microscope, barometer and new forms of math, such as calculus, are just a few innovations.

[.my2]
“科学革命”彻底改变了欧洲的科学研究方法——从随意摸索, 转向更加严谨的实验，这些理念源于与穆斯林和中国学者的间接交流。望远镜、显微镜、气压计以及微积分等新的数学形式，仅仅是其中的几个创新。


=== II. EXPLORATION: CAUSES AND EVENTS

[.my2]
探索：原因和事件

==== NEW WESTERN EUROPEAN STATES SPONSORED TRANSOCEANIC VOYAGES
[.my2]
西欧新国家赞助"跨洋航行"

At the beginning of this era, motivated by “competition” from the Muslim faith in the Mediterranean world, Western European Christians—especially those of Portugal and Spain, who had recently completed a “reconquista” (reconquering) of the Iberian Peninsula from Muslim control—sought to spread their gospel to new areas, particularly South and East Asia, where conversion had thus far been limited. Expeditions almost always included missionaries.

[.my2]
在这一时期之初，**受地中海世界穆斯林信仰“竞争”的驱使，**西欧基督徒——尤其是葡萄牙和西班牙的基督徒，他们刚刚从穆斯林手中夺回了伊比利亚半岛——**试图将福音传播到新的地区，**特别是此前皈依基督教较为有限的南亚和东亚。*几乎所有的远征队都配备了传教士。*

The Protestant Reformation caused a renewed missionary vigor among the Catholic monarchs in Western Europe, who did not want their faith to “lose ground” to new and rapidly growing religions.

[.my2]
*"新教改革"激发了西欧天主教君主们的传教热情，他们不希望自己的信仰(天主教), 被新兴且迅速发展的宗教(新教)“夺走阵地”。*

Trade was also a major motivator for European exploration. You’ve already learned about how the flow of silk, technology, and spices westward from Asia increased wealth and triggered a desire to by-pass the long chain of middlemen that separated European consumers from the riches of the East.

[.my2]
"贸易"也是欧洲探险的主要动力。你已经了解到，丝绸、技术和香料从亚洲向西流动，增加了财富，并激发了欧洲人绕过漫长的中间商链条，直接获取东方财富的愿望。

Why Western Europe and not Eastern Europe? Like the nations in Western Europe, Russia also had access to the new shipping technology and sent ships north into the Arctic Ocean seeking a route to East Asia. Icy conditions, however, made that passage impossible. At the same time, Russia was expanding its land empire across Siberia and did not enter the Pacific until the 17th century. Other nations in Central and Eastern Europe had limited access to the sea and/or were not yet organized to mount such expeditions.

[.my2]
为什么是西欧而不是东欧？与西欧国家一样，俄罗斯也掌握了新的航运技术，并派遣船只北上进入北冰洋，寻找通往东亚的航线。然而，冰封的海面使得这条航线无法通行。与此同时，俄罗斯正在西伯利亚扩张其陆地帝国，直到 17 世纪才进入太平洋。中欧和东欧其他国家出海的渠道有限，而且/或者尚未具备组织此类远征的能力。

==== PORTUGAL LED THE WAY TO NEW LANDS, FOLLOWED BY SPAIN, ENGLAND, FRANCE, AND THE DUTCH

[.my2]
葡萄牙率先开拓新大陆，随后是西班牙、英国、法国和荷兰。

Why were Portugal and Spain the first European nations to venture south (Portugal) and west (Spain) into the Atlantic? Geography was a big reason. Both countries “stick out” into the Atlantic more than other European nations. Portugal’s proximity to Africa made it a logical target of early coastal exploration.

[.my2]
为什么葡萄牙和西班牙是最早向南（葡萄牙）和向西（西班牙）进入大西洋的欧洲国家？地理位置是主要原因。与其他欧洲国家相比，这两个国家在大西洋上显得更为突出。葡萄牙靠近非洲，使其成为早期沿海探险的理想目标。

Portugal’s Prince Henry the Navigator sent many ships down the western coast of Africa looking for a route to the Indies (islands near India in Southeast Asia), in order to set up direct trade with South Asia. Along the way, they charted the Madeira and the Azores Islands. In 1498, Vasco da Gama succeeded in reaching India and returned to Portugal with spices and other valuable goods.  The Portuguese finally established their link to the East, but had the Spanish beaten them?

[.my2]
**葡萄牙的航海家亨利王子, 派遣多艘船只, #沿非洲西海岸航行，寻找通往印度（东南亚靠近印度的岛屿）的航线，以便与南亚建立直接贸易。#**途中，他们绘制了马德拉群岛和亚速尔群岛的地图。1498 年，瓦斯科·达·伽马成功抵达印度，并带着香料和其他贵重物品返回葡萄牙。*葡萄牙人最终建立了与东方的联系，但西班牙人是否抢先一步呢？*

Spain sought a different route to the East—they had little choice since the Portuguese staked out Africa’s coast, and Italian merchants sailed the Mediterranean for goods.

[.my2]
*#西班牙寻求一条通往东方的另类路线——因为由于葡萄牙人占领了非洲海岸，意大利商人航行于地中海进行货物贸易，他们别无选择。#*

① Spain thought the only land mass on Earth was Afro-Eurasia—so sailing west across the Atlantic would bring a ship straight to the islands near India, the Indies, and maybe even China (“Cathay”).
[.my2]
西班牙认为地球上唯一的陆地是亚非欧大陆——因此，向西横渡大西洋将使船只直接到达印度附近的岛屿、印度群岛，甚至可能是中国（“契丹”）。

② Columbus convinced the Spanish royals to fund an expedition for God and for gold—in this case, “gold” meant anything of great value, like spices, silk, or gold. Columbus sought glory. Thus we get the famous “Three G’s of Exploration”—God, glory, and gold.

[.my2]
哥伦布说服西班牙王室资助一次为上帝和黄金而进行的探险——这里的“黄金”指的是任何价值连城的东西，比如香料、丝绸或黄金。哥伦布追求的是荣耀。于是就有了##**著名的“探险三要素”——上帝、荣耀和黄金。**##

③ If Columbus were to reach the East and return, he would put Spain ahead of Portugal, which in 1492 was still trying to find India.
[.my2]
如果哥伦布到达东方并返回，他将使西班牙领先于葡萄牙，而葡萄牙在 1492 年仍在努力寻找印度。


The Spanish thought Columbus had reached Southeast Asia. Instead, of course, he found a New World. Eventually, his landing place, Cuba, and the surrounding islands, were labeled the “West Indies” and its people were called “Indians”—which shows you how much Spain was aiming for the prize of Southeast Asia’s Spice Islands, the real Indies. Over time, however, after Spain began to accumulate great agricultural and mining wealth from the New World, it seemed Columbus’s voyages were not the “mistake” that many in Spain thought.

[.my2]
西班牙人以为哥伦布到达了东南亚。然而，他实际上发现的是新大陆。最终，他的登陆点古巴及其周边岛屿被命名为“西印度群岛”，当地居民被称为“印第安人”——这足以说明西班牙当时觊觎的是东南亚的香料群岛，也就是真正的印度。然而，随着时间的推移，当西班牙从新大陆积累了巨额的农业和矿业财富之后，哥伦布的航行似乎并非许多西班牙人所认为的“错误”。



=== III.  THE COLUMBIAN EXCHANGE AND ITS EFFECTS ON THE WORLD

[.my2]
哥伦布大交换, 及其对世界的影响

==== ANIMALS AND PLANTS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXCHANGE
[.my2]
哥伦布大交换时期的动植物

From Afro-Eurasia to the Americas, Europeans brought horses, pigs, chickens, cows, sugarcane, bananas, wheat, and rice.

[.my2]
从亚非欧大陆到美洲，欧洲人带来了马、猪、鸡、牛、甘蔗、香蕉、小麦和大米。

The introduction of horses to the New World changed the cultures of almost every Native American group as the Americas were without large domesticated animals that could be used for transportation and agriculture (unless you want to count the South American llama and alpaca).

[.my2]
马匹传入新大陆, 改变了几乎所有美洲原住民群体的文化，因为美洲没有大型家畜可以用于运输和农业（除非你想把南美洲的羊驼和美洲驼算在内）。

Sugarcane plantations throughout the Caribbean world helped create rich European kingdoms, and resulted in the importation of slaves from Africa.

[.my2]
加勒比海地区的甘蔗种植园, 帮助建立了富裕的欧洲王国，并导致了从非洲进口奴隶。

From the Americas to Afro-Eurasia, Europeans returned with few animals that had a global impact, but among plants, they brought back potatoes, tomatoes, tobacco, American corn (maize), cocoa, as well as chili and other peppers.

[.my2]
从美洲到亚非欧大陆，欧洲人带回的动物, 很少具有改变全球的影响力. 但在植物方面，他们带回了土豆、西红柿、烟草、美洲玉米、可可，以及辣椒和其他辣椒类。

① Potato was king in Europe. It stored well on ships and grew in a wide variety of soils and climates.

[.my2]
马铃薯在欧洲曾是名副其实的“王者”。它易于在船上储存，并且能在各种土壤和气候条件下生长。

② Maize became a staple in both Africa and China.

[.my2]
玉米成为非洲和中国的主要粮食作物。

③ Potatoes and maize created unprecedented population growth wherever they were planted. The repercussions of this would be felt for centuries with devastating impacts to traditional societies like China.

[.my2]
马铃薯和玉米的种植, 带来了前所未有的人口增长，其影响持续数个世纪，对中国等传统社会造成了毁灭性打击。

==== DISEASES RESULTING FROM THE COLUMBIAN EXCHANGE

[.my2]
由哥伦布大交换引起的疾病

About 90% of the population of the Americas died from these newly-introduced diseases. This de-population created huge open spaces for Europeans to conquer and settle with little resistance.

[.my2]
美洲约 90%的人口, 死于这些新传入的疾病。人口锐减, 为欧洲人征服和定居提供了大片空地，几乎没有遇到任何抵抗。


=== IV.  MARITIME EMPIRES ESTABLISHED

[.my2]
海上帝国的建立


==== A. EUROPEANS CREATED NEW TRADING POSTS IN AFRICA AND ASIA

[.my2]
欧洲人在非洲和亚洲建立了新的贸易站

Portugal was particularly active in creating a global trading-post empire.

[.my2]
葡萄牙尤其积极地建立了一个全球贸易站帝国。

- ① On Africa’s north coast, it captured the port of Ceuta, which became a jumping-off point for continued port-grabbing on Africa’s Atlantic coast. From there, they sailed south and negotiated trade deals with West African kingdoms, like Songhai, usually with military threats.

[.my2]
在非洲北海岸，他们占领了"休达港"，休达港成为他们继续在非洲大西洋沿岸夺取港口的跳板。从那里，他们向南航行，与西非王国（如桑海王国）谈判贸易协定，通常伴随着军事威胁。

- ② Portugal colonized South Africa and continued east into the Indian Ocean, taking over Swahili Coast ports.
[.my2]
葡萄牙殖民了南非，并继续向东进入印度洋，占领了"斯瓦希里海岸"的港口。

- ③ Portugal then conquered Hormuz on the Persian Gulf, Goa on the southwest coast of India, and Malacca in Southeast Asia, leading some to call the Indian Ocean a “Portuguese lake.”

[.my2]
随后，葡萄牙征服了波斯湾的"霍尔木兹"、印度西南海岸的"果阿", 和东南亚的"马六甲"，导致一些人称印度洋为“葡萄牙湖”。


The Netherlands followed and seized many holdings from Portugal, notably South Africa and what is Indonesia today. Vast European holdings in Africa and Asia became known as “trading post empires.”

[.my2]
荷兰随后也从葡萄牙手中夺取了许多领土，特别是南非和今天的印度尼西亚。欧洲在非洲和亚洲的庞大领土, 被称为“贸易站帝国”。


Despite the introduction of Europeans to the Indian Ocean network, trade continued largely as before. Swahili Arabs on the East African coast, Gujaratis merchants on the West Indian coast, and Javanese merchants in Southeast Asia (just to name a few) remained dominant in that region.

[.my2]
尽管欧洲人已将贸易引入印度洋网络，但贸易格局基本保持不变。东非沿岸的斯瓦希里阿拉伯人、西印度群岛沿岸的古吉拉特商人, 以及东南亚的爪哇商人（仅举几例）, 仍然在该地区占据主导地位。


The main difference between European holdings in Africa and Asia and the Americas is that whole continents were conquered in the Americas, but trading outposts were the norm in Africa and Asia.

[.my2]
*欧洲在非洲和亚洲的领土, 与在美洲的领土的主要区别在于，在美洲，整个大陆都被征服了，而在非洲和亚洲，"贸易前哨站"是常态。*


African and Asian opposition was stronger than in the Americas.

[.my2]
非洲和亚洲的反对力量, 比美洲的要强。

- ① The widespread diseases that brought substantial population loss to the Native American population squelched any chance for significant resistance.

[.my2]
导致美洲原住民人口大量减少的广泛疾病, 扼杀了他们任何产生重大抵抗力的机会。

- ② In Japan, the Tokugawa Shogunate restricted European trading ships to just one a year through one designated point on an island in Nagasaki Bay.
[.my2]
在日本，德川幕府限制欧洲商船, 每年只能通过长崎湾一座岛屿(出岛)上的一个指定地点通行。

- ③ In China, the Ming Dynasty, who at first in the 16th century sought to restrict foreign trade, were content to send silk and porcelain to Europe in exchange for lots of silver from colonies in the Americas. Spanish silver from the Americas was brought to the new Spanish colony of the Philippines for transfer to Chinese markets. In this era, China was the destination for most of the world’s silver. This is sometimes known as the global silver drain. The effects of this transfer of wealth from the New World via Spain to China would change each society, causing Spain to suffer bouts of inflation that would later cripple their economic development.

[.my2]
在中国，明朝最初在 16 世纪试图限制对外贸易，但后来却乐于向欧洲出口丝绸和瓷器，以换取美洲殖民地的大量白银。来自美洲的西班牙白银被运往其新殖民地菲律宾，再转运至中国市场。在那个时代，中国是世界上大部分白银的最终目的地。这有时被称为全球白银外流。这种财富从新世界经由西班牙流向中国的做法，对各国社会都产生了影响，导致西班牙遭受了严重的通货膨胀，最终严重阻碍了其经济发展。与此同时，随着商人阶层权力的崛起，

- ④ Portugal managed to gain only one port off the coast of China—Macao.

[.my2]
葡萄牙只在中国沿海获得了一个港口——澳门。

==== EUROPEAN STATES ESTABLISHED NEW MARITIME EMPIRES

[.my2]
欧洲国家建立了新的海上帝国


The Atlantic World is described by the interaction between the four continents on both sides of the Atlantic: North America, South America, Europe, and Africa. Latin America is, of course, also part of the Atlantic World. Britain, France and, to a lesser extent, The Netherlands (Holland/The Dutch) followed Spain and Portugal in establishing colonies in the New World. All held islands in the Caribbean with sugar plantations and competed with each other in that global market.

[.my2]
**大西洋世界, 指的是大西洋两岸四大洲——北美洲、南美洲、欧洲和非洲——之间的互动。**拉丁美洲当然也是大西洋世界的一部分。英国、法国以及荷兰（荷兰/荷属）在西班牙和葡萄牙之后，也开始在新大陆建立殖民地。*它们都在加勒比海地区拥有岛屿和甘蔗种植园，并在全球市场上展开竞争。*


The British, French, and Dutch colonies along the Atlantic coast of North America (i.e., the 13 colonies) were an afterthought. They were not a big economic factor compared to the wealth of metals and sugar coming out of Latin America.

[.my2]
*#北美洲大西洋沿岸的英国、法国和荷兰殖民地（即 13 个殖民地）是后来才被考虑的。与拉丁美洲出产的金属和糖类财富相比，它们并不是重要的经济因素。#*

- ① The biggest economic contribution from the colonies of upper North America—remember, the Caribbean and Mexico are considered part of North America as well—was a species of fish. Cod was enormously popular among people on both sides of the Atlantic. Its presence off the coast of Massachusetts, near Cape Cod, made European monarchs give colonization there a try.

[.my2]
北美北部殖民地（请记住，加勒比海和墨西哥也被视为北美的一部分）最大的经济贡献是一种鱼类。鳕鱼在大西洋两岸的人们中, 都非常受欢迎。由于"马萨诸塞州"沿海"科德角"附近, 盛产鳕鱼，欧洲君主们决定尝试在那里进行殖民扩张。


Initially, Spanish explorers were not settlers and few women made the early voyages. Mixed-race children were born out of relationships between Spaniards and Native women. Slowly, European women made the dangerous trip to the New World and European-only families began to form. Thus, a new social hierarchy was created, with skin color being the determining factor in status.

[.my2]
最初，西班牙探险家并非定居者，早期航行中女性寥寥无几。西班牙人与当地土著女性结合，生育了混血儿。后来，欧洲女性逐渐踏上前往新大陆的危险旅程，纯欧洲人家庭开始形成。由此，一种新的社会等级制度建立起来，肤色成为决定社会地位的关键因素。




====  SHORTAGE OF LABOR AND SLAVERY IN THE NEW WORLD

[.my2]
新世界的劳动力短缺和奴隶制

The high mortality rates of natives on sugarcane plantations resulted in a severe shortage of labor.

[.my2]
甘蔗种植园中当地居民的高死亡率, 导致劳动力严重短缺。

- ① Portugal was first among the European nations to enslave Africans along Africa’s Atlantic coast, and haul them to their sugarcane plantations in Brazil.

[.my2]
*葡萄牙是第一个在非洲大西洋沿岸奴役非洲人，并将他们运往巴西甘蔗种植园的欧洲国家。*

- ② Spain followed suit, transporting Africans bought along the “Slave Coast” in packed ships across the Atlantic (the Middle Passage) to Caribbean sugar plantations.

[.my2]
西班牙也效仿，将沿“奴隶海岸”购买的非洲人装进拥挤的船只，横渡大西洋（中间航道），运往加勒比海的甘蔗种植园。

- ③ This form of slavery that involves buying humans was called chattel slavery.

[.my2]
这种买卖人口的奴隶制形式, 被称为"动产奴隶制"。


West African kingdoms continued to trade slaves within Africa and to Arab and Indian Ocean locales.

[.my2]
西非王国继续在非洲境内, 以及向阿拉伯和印度洋地区, 进行奴隶贸易。

- ① Exporting slaves into the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean areas by Muslim Arabs intensified because of the need for labor.

[.my2]
*由于劳动力短缺，穆斯林阿拉伯人向地中海和印度洋地区贩卖奴隶的现象, 愈演愈烈。*


- ②The Asante and the Kingdom of the Kongo gained power to expand their territory by trading goods such as guns, salt, and animal skins for slaves.

[.my2]
阿散蒂王国, 和刚果王国, 通过用枪支、盐和动物皮毛等商品, 交换奴隶，获得了扩张领土的权力。


Under the encomienda system, Spanish colonists used Amerindians who survived the disease pandemics for their labor needs. The Spanish crown granted conquistadors and settlers large tracts of land called haciendas, and on them, native laborers worked the land, farming and/or raising cattle or, in the case of Peru working in the world’s largest silver mine at Potosi.

[.my2]
在"委任制"下，西班牙殖民者利用在瘟疫中幸存下来的美洲原住民, 来满足其劳动力需求。西班牙王室将大片土地（称为庄园） 授予征服者和定居者，当地劳工在这些土地上耕作，种植作物和/或饲养牲畜，或者像在秘鲁那样，在波托西的世界最大银矿工作。

4. The Incan mit’a system that required its populations to perform public works service was adapted by the Spanish to become a system of forced labor. Complaints of abuse by church and some government officials in Latin America led the crown in Spain to end these systems by the early 18th century.

[.my2]
印加人的米塔制度要求民众从事公共工程服务，西班牙人将其改造为强迫劳动制度。由于拉丁美洲教会和一些政府官员滥用职权，西班牙王室在 18 世纪初废除了这些制度。

5. Indentured servants were enlisted when slaves were unavailable, such as in the British colonies of Virginia and Maryland.

[.my2]
**当奴隶无法获得时，就会招募"契约劳工"，**例如在英国的弗吉尼亚, 和马里兰殖民地。

① In the British colonies, particularly Virginia and Maryland, an indentured servant of British origin was a “temporary slave” for about seven years. At the end of servitude, an indentured servant was free of obligations to his or her master.

[.my2]
*在英国殖民地，特别是弗吉尼亚州和马里兰州，英国籍的"契约劳工"相当于“临时奴隶” ， 期限约为七年。契约期满后，契约劳工便不再对主人负有任何义务。*

② Thousands migrated to the British colonies as indentured servants and, if they survived, established their own destinies in the New World.

[.my2]
成千上万的人作为"契约劳工"移居到英国殖民地，如果他们活了下来，就能在新世界开创了自己的命运。



Changes in labor systems during this era is a frequent subject of test items on the AP ® World History: Modern exam.

[.my2]
这一时期劳动制度的变化, 是 AP® 世界历史：现代考试中经常出现考题的主题 。

====  THE PLANTATION ECONOMY’S GROWTH MEANT CHANGE: DEMOGRAPHIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL

[.my2]
种植园经济的增长意味着变化：人口、社会和文化方面的变化

1.In their zeal to spread the holy word, Catholic missionaries in the Portuguese and Spanish territories held mass baptisms with little religious instruction. Thus, the traditions of the original faiths of the natives continued with Christian beliefs woven in.

[.my2]
1. 为了传播福音，天主教传教士, 在葡萄牙和西班牙的领土上举行大规模洗礼，却很少进行宗教教导。因此，当地土著居民原有的信仰传统, 得以延续，并融入了基督教信仰。



4.Latin American society was a blend of European, African, and Native American cultures.  This blending and the social structures that emerged in Latin America is often referred to as the sociedad de las castas. This system attempted to create hierarchical distinctions between people in the New World based upon the extent of native or African ancestry.

[.my2]
4. 拉丁美洲社会是欧洲、非洲和美洲原住民文化的融合体。 这种融合以及在拉丁美洲形成的社会结构通常被称为“ 种姓社会”（sociedad de las castas） 。该体系试图根据美洲原住民或非洲血统的比例，在新大陆的人们之间建立等级制度。



=== V. MARITIME EMPIRES MAINTAINED AND DEVELOPED

[.my2]
海事帝国得以维持和发展

==== A. MERCANTILISM EXPANDED MARITIME EMPIRES

[.my2]
A. 重商主义扩张了海上帝国

1.Mercantilism is defined as a government policy to ensure exports exceed imports.
1. #*"重商主义"被定义为: 政府为确保"出口超过进口", 而采取的政策。*#

- ① European monarchs extracted raw materials from the colonies, and then manufactured products from those materials to sell globally. The reason was to have a positive balance of trade.

[.my2]
*欧洲君主从殖民地掠夺原材料，然后用这些原材料制造产品, 销往世界各地 (低买高卖)。其目的是为了保持"贸易顺差"。*

- ② Governments imposed taxes—tariffs—on imported products from rival nations.

[.my2]
各国政府, 对来自竞争对手国家的进口产品, 征收税款——关税。

2.The first global trade network was established.

[.my2]
2.第一个全球贸易网络建立。

-  European governments also went into business with private companies that traded globally.

[.my2]
欧洲各国政府, 也与"从事全球贸易的私营公司"开展业务。


- With government cooperation, private companies made and enforced their own laws, approved ship schedules and cargoes, and negotiated commerce agreements with rulers globally.

[.my2]
在政府的合作下，私营公司制定并执行自己的法律，批准船舶时刻表和货物，并与全球统治者谈判商业协议。

-  The British East India Company, the Muscovy Company (a group of English merchants who traded with Russia), and the Dutch East India Company (abbreviated as the “VOC”*) are famous examples of what were called joint-stock companies in which investors pooled their finances to fund the establishment of colonies they hoped would be profitable. The Virginia Colony at Jamestown was founded by a joint-stock company.

[.my2]
英国东印度公司、莫斯科公司（一群与俄罗斯进行贸易的英国商人）和荷兰东印度公司（简称“VOC” ）都是著名的股份制公司，投资者汇集资金建立他们希望盈利的殖民地。詹姆斯敦的弗吉尼亚殖民地, 就是由一家股份制公司建立的。


==== B. ECONOMICS IN AFRICA AND ASIA

[.my2]
非洲和亚洲的经济学



2.In the Indian Ocean region, trade flourished among the traditional participants such as the Swahili Arabs, Omanis, and Gujaritis from East Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia.

[.my2]
2. 在印度洋地区，来自东非、南亚、东南亚和东亚的传统参与者，如斯瓦希里阿拉伯人、阿曼人和古吉拉特人，之间的贸易蓬勃发展。

3.European merchants had to cooperate with local rulers of port cities because they could not dominate this long-standing trade culture on their own. That was one reason Atlantic World trade surpassed that of the Indian Ocean network by the middle of this era.

[.my2]
3. *欧洲商人不得不与港口城市的当地统治者合作，因为他们无法独自主导这种历史悠久的贸易文化。这也是"大西洋世界"贸易, 在这一时期中期超越"印度洋贸易网络"的原因之一。*



==== C. CHANGES IN ASIAN LABOR SYSTEMS

[.my2]
C.亚洲劳动力制度的变化

1.The inclusion of the New World into the global systems of exchange expanded the world economy.

[.my2]
1. 新大陆的加入，使世界经济得以扩张。

2.This expanded economy impacted the operation of labor systems around the world.

[.my2]
2.经济的扩张, 影响了世界各地劳动力系统的运作。

- As a result of increased requirements for goods to trade on the new global market, Russia expanded into Siberia and began to export valuable furs, especially into the newly-rich European market.

[.my2]
由于新兴全球市场对商品的需求不断增长，俄罗斯向西伯利亚扩张，并开始出口珍贵的毛皮，尤其是出口到新兴富裕的欧洲市场。


==== D. ALONG WITH TRADE, RELIGIONS SPREAD TO NEW LANDS

[.my2]
D.随着贸易的进行，宗教也传播到了新的土地。

1.The surest way to become a global religion is to adapt to local customs. This process of merging various beliefs is called syncretism.

[.my2]
1.成为"全球性宗教"最可靠的途径, 就是适应当地习俗。这种融合各种信仰的过程被称为"宗教融合主义" 。

-  In the Caribbean, a mix of indigenous African religions and Christianity merged to produce Vodun, or voodoo.

[.my2]
在加勒比地区，非洲本土宗教与基督教融合，形成了"伏都教"，或称"巫毒教"。

- Hinduism remained the core religion of India.

[.my2]
"印度教"仍然是印度的核心宗教。


=== VI.  INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CHALLENGES TO LAND AND MARITIME EMPIRES, c. 1450–c. 1750

[.my2]
约1450年—约1750年陆地和海洋帝国面临的内部和外部挑战


Examples of slave resistance in the Americas range from sabotaging tools, slowing labor, and running away to form separate colonies away from plantations. These “Maroon societies” were distributed all over the Caribbean and Central America. The largest was in Brazil, had a king, and lasted almost 100 years. It was finally conquered by Portuguese forces at the end of the 17th century.

[.my2]
美洲奴隶反抗的例子包括破坏工具、拖延劳动, 以及逃离种植园建立独立的殖民地。这些“逃亡奴隶社会”遍布加勒比海和中美洲各地。其中规模最大的位于巴西，拥有自己的国王，并持续了近百年。最终，它在 17 世纪末被​​葡萄牙军队征服。

=== VII. CHANGING SOCIAL HIERARCHIES

[.my2]
社会等级制度的变迁

As expected, contacts between the New and Old Worlds had profound effects that are still felt today. In this era, many societies changed.

[.my2]
正如预期的那样，新旧世界之间的接触产生了深远的影响，至今仍能感受到。在这一时期，许多社会都发生了改变。

==== A. POLITICAL ELITES

[.my2]
A.政治精英

1.European royalty marked friends and relatives with titles of nobility, such as “lord” and “marquis.” These aristocrats claimed privileges that the “lesser” classes only dreamed they could have.

[.my2]
1.欧洲皇室会授予亲朋好友“勋爵”、“侯爵”等贵族头衔。这些贵族享有“下层”阶级梦寐以求的特权。

2.The new ruling class in Latin America was the Creole elites. Early settlers in the New World who were born in Spain or Portugal were called the Peninsulares, after the Iberian Peninsula. They were at the top of Latin American society and government. Below that on the societal pyramid were the Creoles, i.e., Europeans born in the New World. Over time, as the numbers of Peninsulares faded and the numbers of Creoles increased, the distinction faded as well.

[.my2]
2.拉丁美洲的新兴统治阶级是"克里奥尔"精英。早期在新大陆定居的西班牙或葡萄牙人, 被称为“ 半岛人”（Peninsulares） ，这个名称源于伊比利亚半岛。他们处于拉丁美洲社会和政府的顶层。在社会金字塔的下层是克里奥尔人，即在新大陆出生的欧洲人。*随着时间的推移，“半岛人”的数量逐渐减少，“克里奥尔人”的数量逐渐增加，这种区别也随之消失。*

3.Below the elites in Latin America were various mixed-race peoples, called Mestizos. Essentially, the more European “blood” a person had (or, conveniently, the whiter the skin), the higher they stood on the social ladder. The more Amerindian or African people appeared, the lower they were on the social ladder. This was known as the sociedad de las castas or Casta system.

3.在拉丁美洲的精英阶层之下，是各种混血人种，被称为梅斯蒂索人（Mestizos）。*本质上，一个人的欧洲血统越多（或者更确切地说，肤色越白），其社会地位就越高。美洲原住民或非洲裔人口越多，其社会地位就越低。这被称为"种姓制度"（ sociedad de las castas ）。*

4.In the North American British and French colonies, there was much less mixing of races. The Europeans established themselves at the top of colonial society, but there was a pecking order among the whites, with European indentured servants below the ruling elites, but above Indians and African slaves.

4.在北美英法殖民地，种族融合程度要低得多。欧洲人确立了自己在殖民地社会的顶层地位，但白人内部也存在等级制度，欧洲"契约劳工"的地位低于统治精英，但高于印第安人和非洲奴隶。
