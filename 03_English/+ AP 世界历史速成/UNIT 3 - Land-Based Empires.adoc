=== I. EMPIRES EXPAND

[.my2]
帝国扩张


==== THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE WAS ESTABLISHED IN ANATOLIA (TURKEY) AT THE END OF THE 13th CENTURY

[.my2]
奥斯曼帝国于 13 世纪末, 在安纳托利亚（土耳其）建立。

The Ottoman Empire reached its peak of power during this era. The empire stretched across North Africa into Southwest Asia and north into modern Turkey, reaching almost to modern Austria. The Ottomans defeated what was left of the Byzantine Empire when they took Constantinople in 1453, renamed it Istanbul, and continued westward into Eastern Europe.

[.my2]
奥斯曼帝国在这一时期达到了鼎盛时期。帝国疆域横跨北非，延伸至西南亚，北至今天的土耳其，几乎到达今天的奥地利境内。1453 年，奥斯曼人攻占君士坦丁堡，将其更名为伊斯坦布尔，击败了拜占庭帝国的残余势力，并继续向西扩张至东欧。

The Ottomans reached the limit of their expansion into Europe by failing to conquer Vienna, Austria, in the early 16th century and again in the late 17th century. Like Russia, the Ottoman Empire struggled with its political identity as part-Asian and part-European. Despite its history of battles with Christian Europe, it wanted to be part of the European diplomatic sphere.

[.my2]
奥斯曼帝国在欧洲的扩张, 止步于 16 世纪初和 17 世纪末 两次攻占奥地利维也纳的尝试均告失败。与俄罗斯一样，奥斯曼帝国也因其兼具亚洲和欧洲特色的政治身份, 而苦苦挣扎。尽管历史上曾与基督教欧洲交战，但它仍然渴望融入欧洲外交体系。

Many Western Christians believed Muslims wanted to conquer all of Europe, especially after the Ottomans seized Constantinople in 1453.

[.my2]
许多西方基督徒认为, 穆斯林想要征服整个欧洲，尤其是在奥斯曼帝国于 1453 年攻占君士坦丁堡之后。

① This concern for the fate of Christianity was a motivation in spreading the faith to the Americas after Columbus’s discoveries.

[.my2]
*对基督教命运的这种担忧，是哥伦布发现美洲之后, 将基督教信仰传播到美洲的动力。*

② Another factor was the European fear that trade routes through Constantinople would be cut off by the Ottomans. Thus, the search for alternate routes to the “East” began.

[.my2]
*另一个因素是, 欧洲人担心途经君士坦丁堡的贸易路线, 会被奥斯曼帝国切断。因此，寻找通往“东方”的替代路线的行动开始了。*

==== IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH ASIA IN THE EARLY 16th CENTURY, MUSLIMS FROM CENTRAL ASIA ESTABLISHED THE MUGHAL EMPIRE

[.my2]
16 世纪初，来自中亚的穆斯林, 在中亚和南亚建立了莫卧儿帝国。
|The Mughal claimed to be descended from the Mongol ruler Chinggis Khan (“Mughal” comes from the word “Mongol”).

[.my2]
莫卧儿王朝声称自己是蒙古统治者成吉思汗的后裔（“莫卧儿”一词源于“蒙古”）。

Rare in Indian history, most of South Asia was united under a single government—for a while.

[.my2]
在印度历史上，南亚大部分地区曾一度统一在一个政府之下，这种情况实属罕见。



Like the Ottomans, the Mughals were Muslim rulers of an empire. Unlike the Ottomans, the Mughals’ faith was in the minority in their own empire. One of the world’s most iconic buildings, the Taj Mahal, was built by a Muslim in the heart of Hindu territory.

[.my2]
与奥斯曼帝国一样，莫卧儿帝国也是由穆斯林统治的。但与奥斯曼帝国不同的是，莫卧儿帝国境内的穆斯林信仰, 属于少数群体。世界上最具标志性的建筑之一——泰姬陵，是由一位穆斯林, 在印度教腹地建造的。

==== RUSSIA BUILT THE LARGEST LAND EMPIRE OF THIS ERA, FIRST TO THE EAST ACROSS SIBERIA, THEN TO THE SOUTH AND WEST

[.my2]
俄罗斯建立了这一时代最大的陆地帝国，首先向东横跨西伯利亚，然后向南和向西扩张。

Russia’s entry into world affairs began with Ivan the Great, who expelled the last of the Mongol rulers in the late 15th century.

[.my2]
俄罗斯进入世界事务始于"伊凡大帝"，他在 15 世纪末 驱逐了最后一个蒙古统治者。

In the 16th century, Ivan the Terrible began a conquest of Siberia that continued for one hundred years.

[.my2]
16 世纪，伊凡雷帝开始了对西伯利亚的征服，这场征服持续了一百年。

Starting in the late 17th century and continuing through the late 18th century, Peter the Great and, later, Catherine the Great pushed a modernization program in Russia to bring their nation closer to the level of Western European technology and culture. This included moving the capital from Moscow to St. Petersburg, the “window on the West.”

[.my2]
从 17 世纪末开始，一直到 18 世纪末，彼得大帝, 以及后来的叶卡捷琳娜大帝, 在俄罗斯推行了一项"现代化"计划，旨在使俄罗斯的科技和文化水平更接近西欧。这其中包括将首都从"莫斯科"迁至"圣彼得堡"，即“通往西方的窗口”。

==== SAFAVID EMPIRE

[.my2]
萨法维王朝
The Safavid Empire in Persia (modern Iran) in the early 16th century sought to expand its borders by waging war with the Ottomans to the west and with the Mughals to the east.

[.my2]
16 世纪初，波斯（今伊朗）的"萨法维王朝", 试图通过与西部的"奥斯曼帝国", 和东部的"莫卧儿帝国"开战, 来扩张其疆域。

Although all three of the bordering states were primarily Muslim, rivalries between factions within Islam was a significant cause of these wars.

[.my2]
*虽然这三个相邻的国家主要信奉伊斯兰教，但伊斯兰教内部各派系之间的竞争, 是这些战争的重要原因。*




=== II. EMPIRES: ADMINISTRATION
[.my2]
帝国：行政管理


==== USING ADMINISTRATIVE PROFESSIONALS TO RUN THE EMPIRE

[.my2]
利用行政专业人员来管理帝国
The Ottoman Empire began in the 13th century and expanded dramatically in this era.

[.my2]
奥斯曼帝国始于 13 世纪，并在这一时期迅速扩张。

==== USING RELIGION, ART, AND ARCHITECTURE TO MAINTAIN POWER

[.my2]
利用宗教、艺术和建筑来维护权力
European monarchs claimed the “divine right” to legitimize their power. This meant the kings believed God was on their side, so if you opposed the king, you opposed God.

[.my2]
欧洲君主声称拥有“君权神授”来使其权力合法化。这意味着君主们相信上帝站在他们一边，所以如果你反对君主，就等于反对上帝。

==== USING TAXES TO MAINTAIN AND BUILD POWER
[.my2]
利用税收, 来维持和发展权力

“Tax farming” was used by many governments. Tax farming used local tax collectors to extract money from individuals.

[.my2]
许多政府都曾采用“包税制”。 "包税制"利用地方税务人员, 向个人征收税款。

Some governments, like the Mughal, recognized local elites, called zamindars, as rent collectors of farmers. In exchange for this right to collect rent, the Mughal required their part.

[.my2]
一些政府，例如莫卧儿王朝，承认地方精英（称为柴明达尔）作为农民的租金征收者。作为收取租金权利的交换，莫卧儿王朝要求柴明达尔向农民缴纳租金。

Imported goods (“tariffs”) were taxed by almost every government.

[.my2]
几乎所有政府, 都对进口商品（“关税”）征税。




=== III. EMPIRES: BELIEF SYSTEMS

[.my2]
帝国：信仰体系

==== THE PROTESTANT REFORMATION SPLIT CHRISTIANITY IN WESTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE
[.my2]
新教改革导致西欧和中欧基督教分裂

In 16th century Central Europe, a reform movement that protested abuses by the Roman Catholic church hierarchy swept across the continent.

[.my2]
16 世纪的中欧，一场抗"议罗马天主教教会等级制度弊端"的改革运动, 席卷了整个欧洲大陆。

① The Protestant Reformation created a major shake-up of Catholic authority, especially in Northern Europe.

[.my2]
宗教改革, 给天主教的权威带来了巨大的震动，尤其是在北欧。

② Large European states like Britain and Sweden, and smaller ones within the Holy Roman Empire adopted Protestantism as their official religion.

[.my2]
英国和瑞典等欧洲大国，以及神圣罗马帝国境内的小国，都以"新教"为国教。

The Roman Catholic church responded with reforms of its own, and maintained its dominance in Southern Europe, and most of Western Europe, and Poland.

[.my2]
罗马天主教会也进行了改革，以示回应，并维持了其在南欧、西欧大部分地区和波兰的统治地位。

In Spain especially, spreading the Catholic faith was a major factor in sending voyages to the New World. Missionaries, including Jesuits, were part of these expeditions.

[.my2]
尤其在西班牙，传播天主教信仰是向新大陆派遣远航的主要因素。传教士，包括耶稣会士，都参与了这些远征。

In Islam, an old division intensified—

[.my2]
在伊斯兰教中，由来已久的分裂加剧了——

The Ottoman and Safavid empires, although Islamic, were political rivals.  +
Ottomans were mainly of the Sunni branch of Islam and the Safavids were mostly Shi’a. These religious differences intensified their political rivalries, leading to religious/political wars over the Mesopotamian region.

[.my2]
"奥斯曼帝国"和"萨法维帝国", 虽然都是伊斯兰教国家，但在政治上却是竞争对手。  +
"奥斯曼帝国"主要信奉"逊尼派"伊斯兰教，而"萨法维帝国"则主要信奉"什叶派"。这些宗教差异加剧了他们的政治敌对，最终导致了围绕"美索不达米亚"地区的宗教/政治战争。
