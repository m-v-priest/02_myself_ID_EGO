== 释义




The Constitution sketches a federal framework that aims to balance the forces of decentralized and centralized governance in general terms; it does not flesh out standard operating procedures that say precisely how the states and federal governments are to handle all policy contingencies imaginable. Therefore, officials at the state and national levels have had some room to maneuver as they operate within the Constitution’s federal design. This has led to changes in the configuration of federalism over time, changes corresponding to different historical phases that capture distinct balances between state and federal authority.

[.my2]
宪法勾勒出一个联邦框架，旨在总体上平衡"分散治理"和"集中治理"的力量；但它并未详细规定各州和联邦政府应如何应对所有可能出现的政策突发事件。因此，州和联邦层面的官员, 在"宪法的联邦框架内"运作时，都有一定的回旋余地。*这导致联邦制结构, 随时间推移而发生变化，这些变化与不同的历史阶段相对应，体现了州权和联邦权之间不同的平衡状态。*

=== THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN NATIONAL POWER AND STATE POWER

[.my2]
国家权力与州权力之间的斗争

As George Washington’s secretary of the treasury from 1789 to 1795, Alexander Hamilton championed legislative efforts to create a publicly chartered bank. For Hamilton, the establishment of the Bank of the United States was fully within Congress’s authority, and he hoped the bank would foster economic development, print and circulate paper money, and provide loans to the government. Although Thomas Jefferson, Washington’s secretary of state, staunchly opposed Hamilton’s plan on the constitutional grounds that the national government had no authority to create such an instrument, Hamilton managed to convince the reluctant president to sign the legislation.

[.my2]
1789 年至 1795 年间，亚历山大· 汉密尔顿担任乔治·华盛顿的财政部长，他大力推动立法，旨在建立一家公有特许银行。汉密尔顿认为，成立美国银行, 完全在国会的职权范围内，他希望这家银行能够促进经济发展，发行和流通纸币，并向政府提供贷款。尽管华盛顿的国务卿托马斯 ·杰斐逊以宪法为由, 坚决反对汉密尔顿的计划，认为联邦政府无权设立这样的机构，但汉密尔顿最终还是说服了这位不情愿的总统签署了这项法案。

When the bank’s charter expired in 1811, Jeffersonian Democratic-Republicans prevailed in blocking its renewal. However, the fiscal hardships that plagued the government during the War of 1812, coupled with the fragility of the country’s financial system, convinced Congress and then-president James Madison to create the Second Bank of the United States in 1816. Many states rejected the Second Bank, arguing that the national government was infringing upon the states’ constitutional jurisdiction.

[.my2]
1811 年银行特许状到期时， 杰斐逊派民主共和党人成功阻止了其续期。然而， 1812 年战争期间政府面临的财政困境，以及国家金融体系的脆弱性，促使国会和时任总统詹姆斯· 麦迪逊, 于 1816 年创建了美国第二银行。 许多州拒绝接受第二银行，认为联邦政府侵犯了各州的宪法管辖权。

A political showdown between Maryland and the national government emerged when James McCulloch, an agent for the Baltimore branch of the Second Bank, refused to pay a tax that Maryland had imposed on all out-of-state chartered banks. The standoff raised two constitutional questions: Did Congress have the authority to charter a national bank? Were states allowed to tax federal property? In McCulloch v. Maryland, Chief Justice John Marshall (Figure 3.8) argued that Congress could create a national bank even though the Constitution did not expressly authorize it. Under the necessary and proper clause of Article I, Section 8, the Supreme Court asserted that Congress could establish “all means which are appropriate” to fulfill “the legitimate ends” of the Constitution. In other words, the bank was an appropriate instrument that enabled the national government to carry out several of its enumerated powers, such as regulating interstate commerce, collecting taxes, and borrowing money.

[.my2]
马里兰州与联邦政府之间的一场政治对峙, 始于第二银行巴尔的摩分行的代理人詹姆斯·麦卡洛克, 拒绝缴纳"马里兰州对所有'外州特许银行'征收的税款"。**这场僵局引发了两个宪法问题：国会是否有权设立国家银行？各州是否有权对联邦财产征税？**在 “麦卡洛克诉马里兰州案”（McCulloch v. Maryland ）中，首席大法官约翰· 马歇尔 （ 图 3.8 ）认为，即使宪法没有明确授权，国会也可以设立国家银行。  **根据宪法第一条第八款的"必要且适当条款"，最高法院断言，国会可以设立“一切适当手段”来实现宪法的“合法目的”。换言之，国家银行是一种适当的工具，使联邦政府能够行使其列举的若干权力，例如监管州际贸易、征税和借贷。**

首席大法官约翰·马歇尔的肖像。




Figure 3.8 Chief Justice John Marshall, shown here in a portrait by Henry Inman, was best known for the principle of judicial review established in Marbury v. Madison (1803), which reinforced the influence and independence of the judiciary branch of the U.S. government.

[.my2]
图 3.8 首席大法官约翰·马歇尔（图中由亨利·英曼绘制）最著名的成就, 是确立了马伯里诉麦迪逊案 （1803 年）中的"司法审查原则"，该原则加强了美国政府司法部门的影响力和独立性。

This ruling established the doctrine of implied powers, granting Congress a vast source of discretionary power to achieve its constitutional responsibilities. The Supreme Court also sided with the federal government on the issue of whether states could tax federal property. Under the supremacy clause of Article VI, legitimate national laws trump conflicting state laws. As the court observed, “the government of the Union, though limited in its powers, is supreme within its sphere of action and its laws, when made in pursuance of the constitution, form the supreme law of the land.” Maryland’s action violated national supremacy because “the power to tax is the power to destroy.” This second ruling established the principle of national supremacy, which prohibits states from meddling in the lawful activities of the national government.

[.my2]
这项裁决确立了"默示权力原则"，赋予国会广泛的"自由裁量权"以履行其宪法职责。**最高法院在"各州是否有权对联邦财产 征税"的问题上, 也支持联邦政府。**根据宪法第六条的最高条款，**合法的联邦法律, 优先于与之冲突的州法律。**正如法院所指出的，“联邦政府虽然权力有限，但在其职权范围内享有至高无上的权力，其根据宪法制定的法律, 构成国家的最高法律。”*##马里兰州的行为, 违反了"联邦至上"原则，因为“征税权即是毁灭权”。这项裁决确立了"联邦至上原则"，##禁止各州干预"联邦政府的合法活动"。*

Defining the scope of national power was the subject of another landmark Supreme Court decision in 1824. In Gibbons v. Ogden, the court had to interpret the commerce clause of Article I, Section 8; specifically, it had to determine whether the federal government had the sole authority to regulate the licensing of steamboats operating between New York and New Jersey. Aaron Ogden, who had obtained an exclusive license from New York State to operate steamboat ferries between New York City and New Jersey, sued Thomas Gibbons, who was operating ferries along the same route under a coasting license issued by the federal government. Gibbons lost in New York state courts and appealed. Chief Justice Marshall delivered a two-part ruling in favor of Gibbons that strengthened the power of the national government. First, interstate commerce was interpreted broadly to mean “commercial intercourse” among states, thus allowing Congress to regulate navigation. Second, because the federal Licensing Act of 1793, which regulated coastal commerce, was a constitutional exercise of Congress’s authority under the commerce clause, federal law trumped the New York State license-monopoly law that had granted Ogden an exclusive steamboat operating license. As Marshall pointed out, “the acts of New York must yield to the law of Congress.”

[.my2]
界定"国家权力的范围", 是 1824 年最高法院另一项具有里程碑意义的判决的主题。在 “吉本斯诉奥格登案” 中，法院必须对《宪法》第一条第八款的商业条款进行解释；具体而言，它必须确定联邦政府是否拥有监管"往返于纽约州和新泽西州之间的蒸汽船许可"的唯一权力。亚伦・奥格登从纽约州获得了"在纽约市和新泽西州之间, 经营蒸汽船渡轮"的独家许可，他起诉了托马斯・吉本斯，后者根据联邦政府颁发的"沿海航行许可证", 在同一路线上经营渡轮。吉本斯在纽约州法院败诉后, 提出上诉。首席大法官马歇尔做出了有利于吉本斯的两部分裁决，这加强了联邦政府的权力。首先，**"州际贸易"被广义地解释为各州之间的 “商业往来”，因此国会有权监管航运。**其次，由于 1793 年规范沿海贸易的联邦《许可法》, 是国会根据商业条款, 行使权力的"合宪行为"，"联邦法律"优先于"授予奥格登'蒸汽船独家运营许可'的纽约州垄断许可法"。正如马歇尔所指出的：“*纽约州的法令, 必须服从国会的法律。*”

Various states railed against the nationalization of power that had been going on since the late 1700s. When President John Adams signed the Sedition Act in 1798, which made it a crime to speak openly against the government, the Kentucky and Virginia legislatures passed resolutions declaring the act null on the grounds that they retained the discretion to follow national laws. In effect, these resolutions articulated the legal reasoning underpinning the doctrine of nullification—that states had the right to reject national laws they deemed unconstitutional.

[.my2]
自 18 世纪末以来，各州一直强烈反对"权力国有化"。1798 年，约翰· 亚当斯总统签署了**《 煽动叛乱法》 ，该法案将"公开反对政府的行为", 定为犯罪。对此，肯塔基州和弗吉尼亚州的立法机构通过了决议，宣布该法案无效，理由是它们保留了"是否遵守国家法律"的"自由裁量权"。实际上，这些决议阐述了支撑 “无效论” 的法律推理 —— 各州有权拒绝接受它们认为违宪的国家法律。** (现在还是这样吗? 州有权拒绝他们认为违宪的联邦法律吗?)

A nullification crisis emerged in the 1830s over President Andrew Jackson’s tariff acts of 1828 and 1832. Led by John Calhoun, President Jackson’s vice president, nullifiers argued that high tariffs on imported goods benefited northern manufacturing interests while disadvantaging economies in the South. South Carolina passed an Ordinance of Nullification declaring both tariff acts null and void and threatened to leave the Union. The federal government responded by enacting the Force Bill in 1833, authorizing President Jackson to use military force against states that challenged federal tariff laws. The prospect of military action coupled with the passage of the Compromise Tariff Act of 1833 (which lowered tariffs over time) led South Carolina to back off, ending the nullification crisis.

[.my2]
19 世纪 30 年代，安德鲁·杰克逊总统于 1828 年和 1832 年颁布的关税法案, 引发了一场“废止危机”。在杰克逊总统的副总统约翰 ·卡尔霍恩的领导下，废止派认为，对"进口商品"征收高额关税, 有利于北方制造业，却损害了南方经济。*南卡罗来纳州通过了一项 “废止法令” ，宣布这两项关税法案无效，并威胁要脱离联邦。联邦政府的回应是, 于 1833 年颁布了《 强制法案》 ，授权杰克逊总统对"挑战联邦'关税法'的州", 动用武力。军事行动的威胁，加上 1833 年 《妥协关税法》 （逐步降低关税）的通过，迫使南卡罗来纳州让步，废止危机就此结束。*

The ultimate showdown between national and state authority came during the Civil War. Prior to the conflict, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, the Supreme Court ruled that the national government lacked the authority to ban slavery in the territories. But the election of President Abraham Lincoln in 1860 led eleven southern states to secede from the United States because they believed the new president would challenge the institution of slavery. What was initially a conflict to preserve the Union became a conflict to end slavery when Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, freeing all enslaved people in the rebellious states. The defeat of the South had a huge impact on the balance of power between the states and the national government in two important ways. First, the Union victory put an end to the right of states to secede and to challenge legitimate national laws. Second, Congress imposed several conditions for readmitting former Confederate states into the Union; among them was ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. In sum, after the Civil War the power balance shifted toward the national government, a movement that had begun several decades before with McCulloch v. Maryland (1819) and Gibbons v. Ogden (1824).

[.my2]
"国家权力"与"州权力"之间的最终较量, 发生在内战期间。**在内战爆发前，最高法院在 “德雷德·斯科特诉桑福德案” 中裁定，联邦政府无权在各领地内,禁止奴隶制。  但 1860 年亚伯拉罕· 林肯当选总统后，南方十一个州宣布脱离联邦，因为他们相信新总统会挑战奴隶制。**最初为维护"联邦统一"而进行的冲突，随着林肯于 1863 年颁布《 解放奴隶宣言》 ，解放了所有叛乱州的奴隶，演变为一场旨在"废除奴隶制"的冲突。南方邦联的战败, 从两个重要方面, 对各州与联邦政府之间的权力平衡, 产生了巨大影响。首先，**联邦的胜利, 终结了各州脱离联邦, 和挑战合法联邦法律的权利。**其次，国会为重新接纳前南方邦联各州加入联邦, 设定了若干条件，其中包括批准第十四和第十五修正案 。总之，**内战结束后，权力平衡向国家政府倾斜，**这一趋势始于几十年前的麦卡洛克诉马里兰州案 （1819 年）和吉本斯诉奥格登案 （1824 年）。

The period between 1819 and the 1860s demonstrated that the national government sought to establish its role within the newly created federal design, which in turn often provoked the states to resist as they sought to protect their interests. With the exception of the Civil War, the Supreme Court settled the power struggles between the states and national government. From a historical perspective, the national supremacy principle introduced during this period did not so much narrow the states’ scope of constitutional authority as restrict their encroachment on national powers.

[.my2]
1819 年至 1860 年代这段时期表明，联邦政府试图在新建立的联邦体制中, 确立自身地位，而这反过来, 又常常激起各州为维护自身利益而进行的抵制。除内战外，最高法院解决了各州与联邦政府之间的权力斗争。从历史角度来看，这一时期引入的“国家至上”原则与其说是缩小了各州的宪法权力范围，不如说是限制了各州对国家权力的侵犯 。

DUAL FEDERALISM

[.my2]
双重联邦制


The late 1870s ushered in a new phase in the evolution of U.S. federalism. Under dual federalism, the states and national government exercise exclusive authority in distinctly delineated spheres of jurisdiction. Like the layers of a cake, the levels of government do not blend with one another but rather are clearly defined. Two factors contributed to the emergence of this conception of federalism. First, several Supreme Court rulings blocked attempts by both state and federal governments to step outside their jurisdictional boundaries. Second, the prevailing economic philosophy at the time loathed government interference in the process of industrial development.

[.my2]
19 世纪 70 年代末，美国联邦制的发展进入了一个新阶段。**在"双重联邦制"下，州政府和联邦政府在各自明确划分的管辖范围内行使专属权力。##如同蛋糕的层层结构，各级政府互不融合，而是界限分明。促成这种联邦制理念出现的因素有两个。首先，最高法院的多项裁决, 阻止了州政府和联邦政府"越权行事"。##其次，当时盛行的经济理念, 反对政府干预工业发展进程。**

Industrialization changed the socioeconomic landscape of the United States. One of its adverse effects was the concentration of market power. Because there was no national regulatory supervision to ensure fairness in market practices, collusive behavior among powerful firms emerged in several industries. To curtail widespread anticompetitive practices in the railroad industry, Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Act in 1887, which created the Interstate Commerce Commission. Three years later, national regulatory capacity was broadened by the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which made it illegal to monopolize or attempt to monopolize and conspire in restraining commerce (Figure 3.9). In the early stages of industrial capitalism, federal regulations were focused for the most part on promoting market competition rather than on addressing the social dislocations resulting from market operations, something the government began to tackle in the 1930s.


[.my2]
工业化改变了美国的社会经济格局。其负面影响之一是市场力量的集中。由于缺乏国家层面的监管, 来确保市场行为的公平性，一些行业 出现了实力雄厚的企业之间的串谋行为。  为了遏制铁路行业普遍存在的反竞争行为，国会于 1887 年通过了《州际商务法》 ，并设立了"州际商务委员会"。三年后，1890 年的 《谢尔曼反垄断法》 扩大了国家监管能力，该法规定垄断、企图垄断, 以及"串谋限制商业", 均属违法行为（ 图 3.9 ）。*#在工业资本主义的早期阶段，联邦法规主要侧重于"促进市场竞争"，而非解决"市场运作造成的社会动荡问题"，而政府直到 20 世纪 30 年代才开始着手解决这一问题。#*

The new federal regulatory regime was dealt a legal blow early in its existence. In 1895, in United States v. E. C. Knight, the Supreme Court ruled that the national government lacked the authority to regulate manufacturing. The case came about when the government, using its regulatory power under the Sherman Act, attempted to override American Sugar’s purchase of four sugar refineries, which would give the company a commanding share of the industry. Distinguishing between commerce among states and the production of goods, the court argued that the national government’s regulatory authority applied only to commercial activities. If manufacturing activities fell within the purview of the commerce clause of the Constitution, then “comparatively little of business operations would be left for state control,” the court argued.

[.my2]
新的"联邦监管体系"在其建立初期, 便遭遇了法律上的打击。1895 年，在 “美国诉 E.C. Knight 案” 中，最高法院裁定, 联邦政府无权监管制造业。 该案的起因是，联邦政府援引《谢尔曼反垄断法》赋予的监管权力，试图阻止美国糖业公司收购四家糖厂，此举将使该公司在糖业中占据主导地位。法院区分了"州际贸易"和"商品生产"，认为联邦政府的监管权力, 仅适用于商业活动。法院指出，如果制造业活动也纳入"宪法商业条款"的管辖范围，那么“留给各州控制的商业活动, 将相对较少”。

In the late 1800s, some states attempted to regulate working conditions. For example, New York State passed the Bakeshop Act in 1897, which prohibited bakery employees from working more than sixty hours in a week. In Lochner v. New York, the Supreme Court ruled this state regulation that capped work hours unconstitutional, on the grounds that it violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In other words, the right to sell and buy labor is a “liberty of the individual” safeguarded by the Constitution, the court asserted. The federal government also took up the issue of working conditions, but that case resulted in the same outcome as in the Lochner case.

[.my2]
19 世纪末，一些州试图规范劳动条件。例如，纽约州于 1897 年通过了 《面包店法案》 ，禁止面包店员工每周工作超过 60 小时。在 “洛克纳诉纽约州案” 中，最高法院裁定"这项限制工时的州法规"违宪，理由是它违反了第十四修正案的正当程序条款。 换言之，法院认为，买卖劳动力的权利, 是受宪法保障的“个人自由”。联邦政府也曾处理过劳动条件问题，但该案的判决结果与 “洛克纳案”相同。

=== COOPERATIVE FEDERALISM

[.my2]
合作联邦主义

The Great Depression of the 1930s brought economic hardships the nation had never witnessed before (Figure 3.10). Between 1929 and 1933, the national unemployment rate reached 25 percent, industrial output dropped by half, stock market assets lost more than half their value, thousands of banks went out of business, and the gross domestic product shrunk by one-quarter. Given the magnitude of the economic depression, there was pressure on the national government to coordinate a robust national response along with the states.

[.my2]
*20 世纪 30 年代的大萧条,* 给美国带来了前所未有的经济困境（ 图 3.10 ）。1929 年至 1933 年间，**全国"失业率"高达 25%，工业产值下降了一半，股市资产价值缩水超过一半，**数千家银行倒闭，*国内生产总值萎缩了四分之一。* 鉴于经济萧条的严重程度，联邦政府面临着与各州协调制定"强有力的全国性应对措施"的巨大压力。

图 3.10 1931 年，正值大萧条时期，芝加哥一家救济食堂外排起了长队。上面的标牌写着“为失业者提供免费汤、咖啡和甜甜圈”。

Cooperative federalism was born of necessity and lasted well into the twentieth century as the national and state governments each found it beneficial. Under this model, both levels of government coordinated their actions to solve national problems, such as the Great Depression and the civil rights struggle of the following decades. In contrast to dual federalism, it erodes the jurisdictional boundaries between the states and national government, leading to a blending of layers as in a marble cake. The era of cooperative federalism contributed to the gradual incursion of national authority into the jurisdictional domain of the states, as well as the expansion of the national government’s power in concurrent policy areas.

[.my2]
**"合作联邦制"**是出于必要性而产生的，并一直延续到二十世纪，因为联邦政府和州政府都从中受益。**在这种模式下，联邦和州政府协调行动，共同解决国家问题，例如大萧条和随后几十年的民权运动。#与"二元联邦制"不同，"合作联邦制"模糊了州政府和联邦政府之间的管辖界限，导致各层权力如同大理石蛋糕般融合。"合作联邦制"时代, 促成了联邦政府权力逐步渗透到各州管辖领域，以及联邦政府在"并行政策领域"的权力扩张。# **

Image depicts federalism as two different types of cake. The first is labeled “Dual Federalism: Layer Cake Federalism”. The cake has three clearly defined horizontal layers. A label states “programs and authority are clearly divided among the national, state, and local governments”. The second cake is labeled “Cooperative Federalism: Marble Cake Federalism”. The cake has layers that are all swirled together instead of being cleanly defined by layers. A label states “programs and authority are mixed among the national, state, and local governments”.

[.my2]
这幅图像, 将"联邦制"描绘成两种不同类型的蛋糕。第一种被标注为 “*双重联邦制：分层蛋糕联邦制*”。这个蛋糕有三个界限分明的水平分层。一个标签写道：“*各项计划和权力, 在联邦政府、州政府和地方政府之间有明确划分*”。第二种蛋糕被标注为 “**合作联邦制：**大理石纹蛋糕联邦制”。**这个蛋糕的各层相互交织，而非界限清晰地分开。**一个标签写道：“*各项计划和权力, 在联邦政府、州政府和地方政府之间相互混合*”。

[.my2]
Figure 3.11 The use of layer and marble cakes for understanding federalism was popularized in the 1950s by political scientist Morton Grodzins. In this metaphor, dual federalism is represented by the layer cake, showing the clearly defined jurisdictional divisions between national, state, and local governments. The marble cake, with the mixing of authority across different governments, represented cooperative federalism.

[.my2]
图 3.11 政治学家莫顿·格罗津斯在 20 世纪 50 年代, 推广了用"分层蛋糕"和"大理石蛋糕"来理解"联邦制"的比喻。在这个比喻中，分层蛋糕代表"二元联邦制"，展现了国家、州和地方政府之间, 清晰的管辖权划分。大理石蛋糕则代表"合作联邦制"，体现了不同政府间权力的融合。

The New Deal programs President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed as a means to tackle the Great Depression ran afoul of the dual-federalism mindset of the justices on the Supreme Court in the 1930s. The court struck down key pillars of the New Deal—the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act, for example—on the grounds that the federal government was operating in matters that were within the purview of the states. The court’s obstructionist position infuriated Roosevelt, leading him in 1937 to propose a court-packing plan that would add one new justice for each one over the age of seventy, thus allowing the president to make a maximum of six new appointments. Before Congress took action on the proposal, the Supreme Court began leaning in support of the New Deal as Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes and Justice Owen Roberts changed their view on federalism.

[.my2]
**富兰克林· 罗斯福总统提出的旨在应对大萧条的"新政计划"，在 20 世纪 30 年代, 与最高法院大法官们奉行的"双重联邦制"思维发生了冲突。#最高法院以"联邦政府干预各州管辖范围之外的事务"为由，否决了新政的关键支柱——例如《 国家工业复兴法》 和《 农业调整法》 。法院的阻挠立场, 激怒了罗斯福，促使他在 1937 年提出了一项“扩充最高法院”的计划，即每位年满 70 岁的大法官都应增加一名，从而使总统最多可以任命六名新大法官。#**在国会就该提案采取行动之前，随着首席大法官查尔斯·埃文斯· 休斯, 和大法官欧文· 罗伯茨, 改变了他们对"联邦制"的看法，最高法院开始倾向于支持"新政"。

In National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) v. Jones and Laughlin Steel,35 for instance, the Supreme Court ruled the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 constitutional, asserting that Congress can use its authority under the commerce clause to regulate both manufacturing activities and labor-management relations. The New Deal changed the relationship Americans had with the national government. Before the Great Depression, the government offered little in terms of financial aid, social benefits, and economic rights. After the New Deal, it provided old-age pensions (Social Security), unemployment insurance, agricultural subsidies, protections for organizing in the workplace, and a variety of other public services created during Roosevelt’s administration.

[.my2]
例如，在 “国家劳工关系委员会诉琼斯和劳克林钢铁公司案”（National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) v. Jones and Laughlin Steel） 中 ，最高法院裁定 1935 年 《国家劳工关系法》 合宪，并确认国会可以根据商业条款赋予的权力，对制造业活动和劳资关系进行监管。*"罗斯福新政"改变了美国民众与联邦政府的关系。#在大萧条之前，政府在财政援助、社会福利, 和经济权利方面提供的帮助微乎其微。新政之后，政府提供了养老金（社会保障）、失业保险、农业补贴、工作场所组织权保护，以及罗斯福执政期间设立的其他各种公共服务。#*

In the 1960s, President Lyndon Johnson’s administration expanded the national government’s role in society even more. Medicaid (which provides medical assistance to the indigent), Medicare (which provides health insurance to the elderly and some people with disabilities), and school nutrition programs were created. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (1965), the Higher Education Act (1965), and the Head Start preschool program (1965) were established to expand educational opportunities and equality (Figure 3.12). The Clean Air Act (1965), the Highway Safety Act (1966), and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (1966) promoted environmental and consumer protection. Finally, laws were passed to promote urban renewal, public housing development, and affordable housing. In addition to these Great Society programs, the Civil Rights Act (1964) and the Voting Rights Act (1965) gave the federal government effective tools to promote civil rights equality across the country.

[.my2]
20 世纪 **60 年代，林登· 约翰逊总统的政府, 进一步扩大了联邦政府在社会中的作用。 医疗补助计划（Medicaid ，为贫困人口提供医疗援助）、医疗保险计划（ Medicare ，为老年人和部分残疾人士提供医疗保险）, 以及学校营养计划, 相继出台。**为了扩大教育机会, 和促进教育公平，1965 年颁布了《中小学教育法 》和 《高等教育法 》，1965 年颁布了“启蒙计划”（ Head Start ）学前教育项目（ 图 3.12 ）。1965 年颁布的《 清洁空气法 》、1966 年颁布的《 公路安全法 》, 和 1966 年颁布的《公平包装和标签法 》, 则促进了环境保护和消费者权益保护。此外，政府还通过了多项法律，以推动城市更新、公共住房开发, 和经济适用房建设。除了这些“伟大社会”计划之外，1964 年颁布的 《民权法案 》和 1965 年颁布的 《投票权法案 》, 也赋予了联邦政府在全国范围内促进民权平等的有效工具。



While the era of cooperative federalism witnessed a broadening of federal powers in concurrent and state policy domains, it is also the era of a deepening coordination between the states and the federal government in Washington. Nowhere is this clearer than with respect to the social welfare and social insurance programs created during the New Deal and Great Society eras, most of which are administered by both state and federal authorities and are jointly funded. The Social Security Act of 1935, which created federal subsidies for state-administered programs for the elderly; people with disabilities; dependent mothers; and children, gave state and local officials wide discretion over eligibility and benefit levels. The unemployment insurance program, also created by the Social Security Act, requires states to provide jobless benefits, but it allows them significant latitude to decide the level of tax to impose on businesses in order to fund the program as well as the duration and replacement rate of unemployment benefits. A similar multilevel division of labor governs Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance.

[.my2]
"合作联邦制"时代, 见证了联邦权力在"并行"和"州政策领域"的扩大，同时也见证了各州与华盛顿联邦政府之间, 协调的加深。这一点在"罗斯福新政", 和"伟大社会时期"建立的社会福利和社会保险项目中, 体现得尤为明显，这些项目, 大多由州和联邦政府共同管理，并由联邦政府共同出资。1935 年的《 社会保障法》 , 为各州管理的"针对老年人、残疾人、受抚养母亲和儿童的项目"提供"联邦补贴"，赋予州和地方官员在"资格认定"和"福利水平"方面, 广泛的自由裁量权。同样由《社会保障法》设立的失业保险项目, 要求各州提供失业救济金，但赋予各州相当大的自主权，可以决定"为该项目而向企业征收的税额水平"，以及失业救济金的期限和替代率。类似的多层级分工, 也适用于医疗补助计划, 和儿童健康保险。




Thus, the era of cooperative federalism left two lasting attributes on federalism in the United States. First, a nationalization of politics emerged as a result of federal legislative activism aimed at addressing national problems such as marketplace inefficiencies, social and political inequality, and poverty. The nationalization process expanded the size of the federal administrative apparatus and increased the flow of federal grants to state and local authorities, which have helped offset the financial costs of maintaining a host of New Deal- and Great Society–era programs. The second lasting attribute is the flexibility that states and local authorities were given in the implementation of federal social welfare programs. One consequence of administrative flexibility, however, is that it has led to cross-state differences in the levels of benefits and coverage.

因此，"合作联邦"主义时代, 给美国的联邦制留下了两个持久的特征。首先，由于"联邦立法机构"积极致力于解决市场效率低下、社会和政治不平等, 以及贫困等国家问题，政治走向了国家化。国家化进程, 扩大了联邦行政机构的规模，并增加了对州和地方政府的联邦拨款，这有助于抵消维持一系列"新政"和"伟大社会时期"项目的财政成本。第二个持久的特征, 是**州和地方政府, 在实施"联邦社会福利项目"方面, 所享有的灵活性。然而，行政灵活性的一个后果是，它导致了各州在福利水平和覆盖范围方面的差异。**

=== NEW FEDERALISM

[.my2]
新联邦主义


During the administrations of Presidents Richard Nixon (1969–1974) and Ronald Reagan (1981–1989), attempts were made to reverse the process of nationalization—that is, to restore states’ prominence in policy areas into which the federal government had moved in the past. New federalism is premised on the idea that the decentralization of policies enhances administrative efficiency, reduces overall public spending, and improves policy outcomes. During Nixon’s administration, general revenue sharing programs were created that distributed funds to the state and local governments with minimal restrictions on how the money was spent. The election of Ronald Reagan heralded the advent of a “devolution revolution” in U.S. federalism, in which the president pledged to return authority to the states according to the Constitution. In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, congressional leaders together with President Reagan consolidated numerous federal grant programs related to social welfare and reformulated them in order to give state and local administrators greater discretion in using federal funds.

[.my2]
*在理查德 ·尼克松总统（1969-1974）和罗纳德· 里根总统（1981-1989）执政期间，曾有人试图扭转联邦政府主导的政策领域的"国家化"进程，即恢复各州在"过去联邦政府介入的政策领域"的主导地位。* "新联邦主义"的前提是，政策权力下放, 能够提高行政效率、降低公共支出总额, 并改善政策效果。在尼克松执政期间，设立了"一般收入分享计划"，**将资金分配给州和地方政府，并尽可能减少对资金使用方式的限制。**罗纳德·里根的当选, 标志着美国联邦制“权力下放革命”的到来，**里根总统承诺, 根据宪法将权力归还给各州。**在 1981 年的 《综合预算协调法案》 中，国会领导人与里根总统, 共同整合了众多与"社会福利"相关的联邦拨款项目，并对其进行了重新调整，以赋予州和地方行政人员, 更大的联邦资金使用自主权。

However, Reagan’s track record in promoting new federalism was inconsistent. This was partly due to the fact that the president’s devolution agenda met some opposition from Democrats in Congress, moderate Republicans, and interest groups, preventing him from making further advances on that front. For example, his efforts to completely devolve Aid to Families With Dependent Children (a New Deal-era program) and food stamps (a Great Society-era program) to the states were rejected by members of Congress, who feared states would underfund both programs, and by members of the National Governors’ Association, who believed the proposal would be too costly for states. Reagan terminated general revenue sharing in 1986.

[.my2]
然而，里根在推动"新联邦制"方面的记录, 并不稳定。这部分是由于总统的权力下放议程, 遭到国会民主党人、温和派共和党人, 和利益集团的反对，阻碍了他在这一领域取得进一步进展。例如，**他试图将“对有子女家庭的援助”（一项新政时期的项目）和“食品券”（一项“伟大社会”时期的项目）完全下放给各州，但遭到国会议员的反对，他们担心各州会削减这两项项目的资金；**同时，全国州长协会的成员, 也反对这项提议，他们认为该提议对各州来说成本过高。里根于 1986 年终止了"一般收入分享计划"。

Several Supreme Court rulings also promoted new federalism by hemming in the scope of the national government’s power, especially under the commerce clause. For example, in United States v. Lopez, the court struck down the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, which banned gun possession in school zones. It argued that the regulation in question did not “substantively affect interstate commerce.” The ruling ended a nearly sixty-year period in which the court had used a broad interpretation of the commerce clause that by the 1960s allowed it to regulate numerous local commercial activities.

[.my2]
最高法院的几项裁决, 也通过"限制联邦政府的权力范围"，特别是商业条款的权力范围，推动了"新联邦主义"的形成。例如，*在 “美国诉洛佩兹案” 中，法院推翻了 1990 年的 《无枪校园区法案》 ，该法案禁止在校园区内持有枪支。*(意思是现在校园里可以持枪吗?)  法院认为，相关法规并未“实质性地影响州际贸易”。这项裁决结束了近六十年来法院对商业条款的广泛解释，这种解释在 20 世纪 60 年代, 使其能够监管众多地方商业活动。

However, many would say that the years since the 9/11 attacks have swung the pendulum back in the direction of central federal power. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security federalized disaster response power in Washington, and the Transportation Security Administration was created to federalize airport security. Broad new federal policies and mandates have also been carried out in the form of the Faith-Based Initiative and No Child Left Behind (during the George W. Bush administration) and the Affordable Care Act (during Barack Obama’s administration).

[.my2]
然而，许多人认为，自 9/11 事件以来，权力天平已再次向中央联邦权力倾斜。 "国土安全部"的成立, 使灾难应对权力落入华盛顿的联邦政府手中，而"运输安全管理局"的成立, 则使机场安检也实现了联邦化。此外，诸如“信仰基础教育倡议”（Faith-Based Initiative）和“不让一个孩子掉队法案”（ No Child Left Behind ）（乔治·W·布什政府时期）, 以及 “平价医疗法案”（Affordable Care Act ）（巴拉克·奥巴马政府时期）等一系列新的联邦政策和指令, 也相继出台。


=== Finding a Middle Ground -- Cooperative Federalism versus New Federalism

[.my2]
寻找折衷方案 -- 合作联邦制与新联邦制


The challenges of the 1930s led many to question the merits of dual federalism, where the states and the national governments exercised exclusive authority in distinctly delineated spheres of jurisdiction. The result was the birth of cooperative federalism. In this view of federalism, the jurisdictional boundaries between the national and state governments were eroded to allow for greater cooperation between both governments. While this expansion of national government power was crucial in tackling the problems of the Great Depression, environmental degradation, and civil rights abuses, many resented the federal incursions into what had earlier been state matters. These concerns led to the emergence of new federalism in the 1970s and '80s. New federalism was premised on the idea that the decentralization of policies enhanced administrative efficiency and improved outcomes. Rather than simply a return to the old dual federalism model, new federalism continued much of the federal spending but rolled back many of the restrictions on what states could do with their federal funds.

[.my2]
**20世纪30年代的种种挑战, 使许多人开始质疑"双重联邦制"的合理性。在双重联邦制下，州政府和联邦政府在各自明确的管辖范围内, 行使专属权力。由此催生了"合作联邦制"。在这种联邦制理念下，联邦政府和州政府之间的管辖界限被削弱，以促进双方更紧密的合作。**虽然联邦政府权力的扩张, 对于应对大萧条、环境恶化, 和侵犯公民权利等问题至关重要，*但许多人对"联邦政府干预原本属于州级事务"的做法, 感到不满。这些担忧, 促成了20世纪70年代和80年代"新联邦制"的出现(也就是美国人依然在不断平衡中央的权力和地方的权力, 犹如在平衡跷跷板一样)。*"新联邦制"的前提是，政策的权力下放, 能够提高"行政效率", 并改善结果。"新联邦制"并非简单地回归旧的"双重联邦制"模式，而是在保留大部分"联邦支出"的同时，取消了对各州使用联邦资金的诸多限制。(具体来说, 什么是"新联邦制"?)

Cooperative federalism has several merits:

[.my2]
"合作联邦制"具有以下几个优点：

- Because state and local governments have varying fiscal capacities, the national government’s involvement in state activities such as education, health, and social welfare is necessary to ensure some degree of uniformity in the provision of public services to citizens in richer and poorer states.

[.my2]
**由于州和地方政府的财政能力各不相同，因此国家政府必须参与州政府的教育、卫生和社会福利等活动，**以确保在向较富裕和较贫穷的州的公民 提供公共服务时，能够达到一定程度的"统一性"。

- The problem of collective action, which dissuades state and local authorities from raising regulatory standards for fear they will be disadvantaged as others lower theirs, is resolved by requiring state and local authorities to meet minimum federal standards (e.g., minimum wage and air quality).

[.my2]
集体行动的问题在于，它阻碍了州和地方当局提高监管标准，因为担心当其他人降低标准时，自己会处于不利地位。这个问题可以通过要求州和地方当局达到最低联邦标准（例如，最低工资和空气质量）来解决。

- Federal assistance is necessary to ensure state and local programs that generate positive externalities are maintained. For example, one state’s environmental regulations impose higher fuel prices on its residents, but the externality of the cleaner air they produce benefits neighboring states. Without the federal government’s support, this state and others like it would underfund such programs.

[.my2]
联邦政府的援助, 对于确保那些能够产生"积极外部效应"的州和地方项目, 得以维持至关重要。例如，某个州的环境法规, 虽然会推高本州居民的燃油价格，但其带来的空气质量改善, 却惠及邻近州。如果没有联邦政府的支持，该州以及其他类似的州, 将无法为这类项目提供足够的资金。


New federalism has advantages as well:

[.my2]
"新联邦制"也有其优势：

- Because of differences among states, one-size-fits-all features of federal laws are suboptimal. Decentralization accommodates the diversity that exists across states.

[.my2]
由于各州之间存在差异，联邦法律的“一刀切”式做法, 并非最佳选择。权力下放能够更好地适应各州之间的这种多样性。

- By virtue of being closer to citizens, state and local authorities are better than federal agencies at discerning the public’s needs.

[.my2]
由于更贴近民众，州和地方政府, 比联邦机构更能了解公众的需求。

- Decentralized federalism fosters a marketplace of innovative policy ideas as states compete against each other to minimize administrative costs and maximize policy output.

[.my2]
分散的联邦制, 促进了创新政策理念的市场，各州相互竞争，以最大限度地降低"行政成本", 并最大限度地提高政策产出。
