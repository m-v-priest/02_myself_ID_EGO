== 释义





The evolution of the media has been fraught with concerns and problems. Accusations of mind control, bias, and poor quality have been thrown at the media on a regular basis. Yet the growth of communications technology allows people today to find more information more easily than any previous generation. Mass media can be print, radio, television, or Internet news. They can be local, national, or international. They can be broad or limited in their focus. The choices are tremendous.

媒体的发展历程充满了各种担忧和问题。媒体经常受到精神控制、偏见和低质量等指责。然而，通信技术的进步使得当今人们比以往任何一代人都能更轻松地获取更多信息。大众媒体可以是印刷媒体、广播、电视或网络新闻。它们可以是地方性的、全国性的或国际性的。它们的关注点可以是广泛的，也可以是特定的。选择可谓琳琅满目。

PRINT MEDIA  印刷媒体
Early news was presented to local populations through the print press. While several colonies had printers and occasional newspapers, high literacy rates combined with the desire for self-government made Boston a perfect location for the creation of a newspaper, and the first continuous press was started there in 1704.22 Newspapers spread information about local events and activities. The Stamp Tax of 1765 raised costs for publishers, however, leading several newspapers to fold under the increased cost of paper. The repeal of the Stamp Tax in 1766 quieted concerns for a short while, but editors and writers soon began questioning the right of the British to rule over the colonies. Newspapers took part in the effort to inform citizens of British misdeeds and incite attempts to revolt. Readership across the colonies increased to nearly forty thousand homes (among a total population of two million), and daily papers sprang up in large cities.23
早期新闻主要通过印刷机传播给当地居民。虽然一些殖民地拥有印刷厂和零星报纸，但波士顿的高识字率以及对自治的渴望使其成为创办报纸的理想之地，第一份连续印刷机于 1704 年在此诞生。 22 报纸传播着当地事件和活动的信息。然而，1765 年的印花税提高了出版商的成本，导致一些报纸因纸张价格上涨而倒闭。1766 年印花税的废除暂时平息了人们的担忧，但编辑和作家很快开始质疑英国统治殖民地的合法性。报纸参与了向公民揭露英国罪行并煽动反抗的活动。整个殖民地的读者群增长到近四万户家庭（总人口两百万），各大城市也涌现出日报。 23

Although newspapers united for a common cause during the Revolutionary War, the divisions that occurred during the Constitutional Convention and the United States’ early history created a change. The publication of the Federalist Papers, as well as the Anti-Federalist Papers, in the 1780s, moved the nation into the party press era, in which partisanship and political party loyalty dominated the choice of editorial content. One reason was cost. Subscriptions and advertisements did not fully cover printing costs, and political parties stepped in to support presses that aided the parties and their policies. Papers began printing party propaganda and messages, even publicly attacking political leaders like George Washington. Despite the antagonism of the press, Washington and several other founders felt that freedom of the press was important for creating an informed electorate. Indeed, freedom of the press is enshrined in the Bill of Rights in the first amendment.

[.my2]
尽管在独立战争期间，报纸曾团结一致，但制宪会议和美国早期历史中的分裂导致了变革。18 世纪 80 年代，《 联邦党人文集》 和《反联邦党人文集》的出版，使美国进入了党派报刊时代 ，党派立场和政治忠诚主导了报刊内容的选择。其中一个原因是成本。订阅和广告收入不足以完全覆盖印刷成本，因此各政党纷纷出手支持那些服务于本党及其政策的报刊。报纸开始刊登党派宣传和信息，甚至公开攻击像乔治·华盛顿这样的政治领袖。尽管报刊存在敌对情绪，华盛顿和其他几位开国元勋仍然认为，新闻自由对于培养知情选民至关重要。事实上，新闻自由已被写入《权利法案》的第一修正案。

Between 1830 and 1860, machines and manufacturing made the production of newspapers faster and less expensive. Benjamin Day’s paper, the New York Sun, used technology like the linotype machine to mass-produce papers (Figure 8.6). Roads and waterways were expanded, decreasing the costs of distributing printed materials to subscribers. New newspapers popped up. The popular penny press papers and magazines contained more gossip than news, but they were affordable at a penny per issue. Over time, papers expanded their coverage to include racing, weather, and educational materials. By 1841, some news reporters considered themselves responsible for upholding high journalistic standards, and under the editor (and politician) Horace Greeley, the New-York Tribune became a nationally respected newspaper. By the end of the Civil War, more journalists and newspapers were aiming to meet professional standards of accuracy and impartiality.24
1830 年至 1860 年间，机器和制造业的发展使得报纸的生产速度更快、成本更低。本杰明·戴创办的《 纽约太阳报 》利用排字机等技术进行大规模报纸生产（ 图 8.6 ）。道路和水路的扩建降低了印刷品分发给订户的成本。新的报纸如雨后春笋般涌现。当时流行的便士报刊杂志虽然新闻内容多于八卦，但每期仅售一便士，价格实惠。随着时间的推移，报纸的报道范围不断扩大，涵盖了赛马、天气和教育等内容。到 1841 年，一些新闻记者开始认为自己有责任维护高标准的职业操守。在编辑（兼政治家）霍勒斯·格里利的领导下，《 纽约论坛报》 成为一份在全国范围内享有盛誉的报纸。到内战结束时，越来越多的记者和报纸开始致力于达到专业标准的准确性和公正性。 24

Figure 8.6 Benjamin Day (a) founded the first U.S. penny press, The Sun, in 1833. The Sun, whose front page from November 26, 1834, is shown above (b), was a morning newspaper published in New York from 1833 to 1950.

[.my2]
图 8.6 本杰明·戴 (a) 于 1833 年创办了美国第一家便士报纸 《太阳报 》。 《太阳报 》是一份晨报，从 1833 年到 1950 年在纽约出版，其 1834 年 11 月 26 日的头版如上图所示 (b)。
Yet readers still wanted to be entertained. Joseph Pulitzer and the New York World gave them what they wanted. The tabloid-style paper included editorial pages, cartoons, and pictures, while the front-page news was sensational and scandalous. This style of coverage became known as yellow journalism. Ads sold quickly thanks to the paper’s popularity, and the Sunday edition became a regular feature of the newspaper. As the New York World’s circulation increased, other papers copied Pulitzer’s style in an effort to sell papers. Competition between newspapers led to increasingly sensationalized covers and crude issues.

[.my2]
然而，读者仍然渴望娱乐。约瑟夫· 普利策和 《纽约世界报》满足了他们的需求。这份小报风格的报纸刊登社论、漫画和图片，而头版新闻则耸人听闻、丑闻不断。这种报道风格被称为 “黄色新闻” 。由于报纸的受欢迎程度，广告销售火爆，周日版也成为报纸的固定版面。随着 《纽约世界报》发行量的增长，其他报纸为了提高销量，纷纷效仿普利策的风格。报纸之间的竞争导致封面越来越耸人听闻，内容也越来越粗俗不堪。

In 1896, Adolph Ochs purchased the New York Times with the goal of creating a dignified newspaper that would provide readers with important news about the economy, politics, and the world rather than gossip and comics. The New York Times brought back the informational model, which exhibits impartiality and accuracy and promotes transparency in government and politics. With the arrival of the Progressive Era, the media began muckraking: the writing and publishing of news coverage that exposed corrupt business and government practices. Investigative work like Upton Sinclair’s serialized novel The Jungle led to changes in the way industrial workers were treated and local political machines were run. The Pure Food and Drug Act and other laws were passed to protect consumers and employees from unsafe food processing practices. Local and state government officials who participated in bribery and corruption became the centerpieces of exposés.

[.my2]
1896 年，阿道夫 ·奥克斯收购了《 纽约时报》 ，旨在打造一份体面的报纸，为读者提供有关经济、政治和世界的重要新闻，而非八卦和漫画。《 纽约时报》 重拾了信息模式，展现出公正和准确，并促进政府和政治的透明度。随着进步时代的到来，媒体开始进行 “揭丑” 报道：撰写和发表揭露腐败的商业和政府行为的新闻报道。像厄普顿·辛克莱的连载小说 《丛林》 这样的调查性作品，促使产业工人的待遇和地方政治机器的运作方式发生了改变。《纯净食品药品法》和其他法律的颁布，旨在保护消费者和员工免受不安全食品加工行为的侵害。参与贿赂和腐败的地方和州政府官员成为揭露报道的焦点。

Some muckraking journalism still appears today, and the quicker movement of information through the system would seem to suggest an environment for yet more investigative work and the punch of exposés than in the past. However, at the same time there are fewer journalists being hired than there used to be. The scarcity of journalists and the lack of time to dig for details in a 24-hour, profit-oriented news model make investigative stories rare.25 There are two potential concerns about the decline of investigative journalism in the digital age. First, one potential shortcoming is that the quality of news content will become uneven in depth and quality, which could lead to a less informed citizenry. Second, if investigative journalism in its systematic form declines, then the cases of wrongdoing that are the objects of such investigations would have a greater chance of going on undetected.

[.my2]
如今，一些揭露丑闻的新闻报道依然存在，信息在系统中的快速流通似乎预示着，与过去相比，调查性报道和揭露性新闻将更加活跃。然而，与此同时，记者的就业人数却比以往有所减少。在 24 小时不间断、以盈利为导向的新闻模式下 ， 记者的匮乏以及缺乏时间深入挖掘细节，使得调查性报道变得十分罕见。25 在数字时代，调查性新闻的衰落可能引发两个潜在问题。首先，新闻内容的质量可能会出现深度和深度上的参差不齐，从而导致公众的知情权下降。其次，如果系统性的调查性新闻报道减少，那么作为此类调查对象的违法行为就更有可能逍遥法外。

In the twenty-first century, newspapers have struggled to stay financially stable. Print media earned $46 billion from ads in 2012, but only $20.5 billion from ads in 2020.26 Given the countless alternate forms of news, many of which are free, newspaper subscriptions have fallen. Advertising and especially classified ad revenue dipped. Many newspapers now maintain both a print and an Internet presence in order to compete for readers. The rise of free news blogs, such as the Huffington Post, have made it difficult for newspapers to force readers to purchase online subscriptions to access material they place behind a digital paywall. Some local newspapers, in an effort to stay visible and profitable, have turned to social media, like Facebook and Twitter. Stories can be posted and retweeted, allowing readers to comment and forward material.27 Yet, overall, newspapers have adapted, becoming leaner—though less thorough and investigative—versions of their earlier selves. However, despite this adaptation, one-fifth of small-town newspapers have folded. The fear is that Americans will know less about their community as a result.28 This drop-off in available news has also occurred at the state level, as state legislative press corps have shrunk considerably. Many surviving small-town papers have been acquired by larger conglomerates. National newspapers have done comparatively better, although consolidation has occurred there to some degree, too.29
进入 21 世纪，报纸的财务状况一直举步维艰。2012 年，纸媒广告收入高达 460 亿美元，而到了 2020 年，这一数字仅为 205 亿美元。 26 由于新闻渠道层出不穷，其中许多都是免费的，报纸订阅量大幅下降。广告收入，尤其是分类广告收入，也随之锐减。为了争夺读者，许多报纸如今同时运营纸质版和网络版。像 《赫芬顿邮报》 这样的免费新闻博客的兴起，使得报纸难以再强迫读者购买在线订阅才能访问那些被付费墙阻隔的内容。一些地方报纸为了保持知名度和盈利能力，开始利用 Fa​​cebook 和 Twitter 等社交媒体平台。新闻可以发布和转发，读者可以评论和转发内容。 27 然而，总体而言，报纸已经做出了调整，变得更加精简——尽管深度和调查性有所下降。尽管如此，仍有五分之一的小城镇报纸倒闭了。人们担心 ， 这会导致美国人对自己的社区了解减少。28 这种新闻可获取量的下降也发生在州一级，因为州立法机构的新闻记者队伍已经大幅缩减。许多幸存的小城镇报纸已被大型企业集团收购。全国性报纸的情况相对较好，尽管它们也出现了一定程度的整合 。29

RADIO  收音机
Radio news made its appearance in the 1920s. The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) began running sponsored news programs and radio dramas. Comedy programs, such as Amos ’n’ Andy, The Adventures of Gracie, and Easy Aces, also became popular during the 1930s, as listeners were trying to find humor during the Depression (Figure 8.7). Talk shows, religious shows, and educational programs followed, and by the late 1930s, game shows and quiz shows were added to the airwaves. Almost 83 percent of households had a radio by 1940, and most tuned in regularly.30
广播新闻在 20 世纪 20 年代出现。美国国家广播公司（NBC）和哥伦比亚广播公司（CBS）开始播出赞助新闻节目和广播剧。在 20 世纪 30 年代，喜剧节目，如 《阿莫斯与安迪》 、 《格蕾西的冒险 》和 《轻松王牌》 也开始流行，因为听众们在大萧条时期试图寻找幽默（ 图 8.7 ）。随后出现了谈话节目、宗教节目和教育节目，到了 20 世纪 30 年代末，游戏节目和问答节目也加入了广播。到 1940 年，近 83%的家庭拥有收音机，而且大多数家庭经常收听广播。

Figure 8.7 The “golden age of radio” included comedy shows like Easy Aces, starring Goodman and Jane Ace (a), and Amos ’n’ Andy, starring Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll, shown here celebrating their program’s tenth anniversary in 1938 (b). These programs helped amuse families during the dark years of the Depression.

图 8.7 “广播的黄金时代”包括像 《Easy Aces》 （由古德曼和简·艾斯主演，图 a）和 《Amos 'n' Andy》 （由弗里曼·戈斯登和查尔斯·科雷尔主演，图中为该节目在 1938 年庆祝十周年纪念的场景，图 b）这样的喜剧节目。这些节目在经济大萧条的黑暗岁月里为无数家庭带来了欢乐。
Not just something to be enjoyed by those in the city, the proliferation of the radio brought communications to rural America as well. News and entertainment programs were also targeted to rural communities. WLS in Chicago provided the National Farm and Home Hour and the WLS Barn Dance. WSM in Nashville began to broadcast the live music show called the Grand Ole Opry, which is still broadcast every week and is the longest live broadcast radio show in U.S. history.31
广播的普及不仅让城市居民享受到了广播的便利，也为美国乡村地区带来了通讯。新闻和娱乐节目也开始面向乡村社区播出。芝加哥的 WLS 电台推出了《 全国农场与家庭时间》（National Farm and Home Hour ）和 《WLS 谷仓舞会》（WLS Barn Dance ）。纳什维尔的 WSM 电台开始播出名为《 大奥普里》（Grand Ole Opry） 的现场音乐节目，该节目至今仍每周播出，是美国历史上播出时间最长的现场广播节目 。31

As radio listenership grew, politicians realized that the medium offered a way to reach the public in a personal manner. Warren Harding was the first president to regularly give speeches over the radio. President Herbert Hoover used radio as well, mainly to announce government programs on aid and unemployment relief.32 Yet it was Franklin D. Roosevelt who became famous for harnessing the political power of radio. On entering office in March 1933, President Roosevelt needed to quiet public fears about the economy and prevent people from removing their money from the banks. He delivered his first radio speech eight days after assuming the presidency:
随着广播听众的增长，政治家们意识到，这种媒介提供了一种以更个性化的方式接触公众的途径 。 沃伦·哈丁是第一位定期通过广播发表讲话的总统。赫伯特·胡佛总统也利用广播，主要用于宣布政府的援助和失业救济计划。然而，真正因驾驭广播的政治力量而闻名的却是富兰克林· 罗斯福 。1933 年 3 月就职后，罗斯福总统需要安抚公众对经济的担忧，并防止人们从银行提取存款。他在就职八天后发表了他的首次广播讲话：

“My friends: I want to talk for a few minutes with the people of the United States about banking—to talk with the comparatively few who understand the mechanics of banking, but more particularly with the overwhelming majority of you who use banks for the making of deposits and the drawing of checks. I want to tell you what has been done in the last few days, and why it was done, and what the next steps are going to be.”33
“我的朋友们：我想花几分钟时间和美国人民谈谈银行业——和那些相对较少了解银行运作机制的人谈谈，但更重要的是和你们绝大多数使用银行进行存款和开支票的人谈谈。我想告诉你们过去几天里做了什么，为什么这样做，以及下一步的计划是什么。” 33

Roosevelt spoke directly to the people and addressed them as equals. One listener described the chats as soothing, with the president acting like a father, sitting in the room with the family, cutting through the political nonsense and describing what help he needed from each family member.34 Roosevelt would sit down and explain his ideas and actions directly to the people on a regular basis, confident that he could convince voters of their value.35 His speeches became known as “fireside chats” and formed an important way for him to promote his New Deal agenda (Figure 8.8). Roosevelt’s combination of persuasive rhetoric and the media allowed him to expand both the government and the presidency beyond their traditional roles.36
罗斯福直接与民众对话，并将他们视为平等的一员。一位听众形容这些谈话令人感到舒缓，总统就像一位父亲，与家人坐在一起，直面政治的虚伪，并详细说明他需要每位家庭成员的帮助。 34 罗斯福会定期坐下来，直接向民众解释他的理念和行动，他相信自己能够说服选民认可这些理念和行动的价值。 35 他的演讲被称为“ 炉边谈话 ”，成为他推广新政议程的重要途径（ 图 8.8 ）。罗斯福巧妙地运用修辞和媒体，使政府和总统的职能超越了传统范畴。 36

During this time, print news still controlled much of the information flowing to the public. Radio news programs were limited in scope and number. But in the 1940s the German annexation of Austria, conflict in Europe, and World War II changed radio news forever. The need and desire for frequent news updates about the constantly evolving war made newspapers, with their once-a-day printing, too slow. People wanted to know what was happening, and they wanted to know immediately. Although initially reluctant to be on the air, reporter Edward R. Murrow of CBS began reporting live about Germany’s actions from his posts in Europe. His reporting contained news and some commentary, and even live coverage during Germany’s aerial bombing of London. To protect covert military operations during the war, the White House had placed guidelines on the reporting of classified information, making a legal exception to the First Amendment’s protection against government involvement in the press. Newscasters voluntarily agreed to suppress information, such as about the development of the atomic bomb and movements of the military, until after the events had occurred.37
在此期间，纸媒新闻仍然掌控着大部分公众获取信息的渠道。广播新闻节目的范围和数量都十分有限。但到了 20 世纪 40 年代，德国吞并奥地利、欧洲战事以及第二次世界大战彻底改变了广播新闻的格局。人们对不断演变的战争新闻更新的需求和渴望，使得每天只出版一次的报纸显得力不从心。人们想知道正在发生的事情，而且是想立即知道。尽管最初并不情愿出现在广播中，哥伦比亚广播公司（CBS）的记者爱德华·R· 默罗还是开始从他在欧洲的岗位上直播报道德国的行动。他的报道包含新闻和一些评论，甚至包括对德国空袭伦敦的现场报道。为了保护战争期间的秘密军事行动，白宫制定了关于报道机密信息的指导方针，这实际上对第一修正案中关于政府干预新闻自由的保护条款做出了法律上的例外。新闻播音员们自愿同意压制有关原子弹研发和军事行动等信息，直到事件发生之后才予以公布 。37

The number of professional and amateur radio stations grew quickly. Initially, the government exerted little legislative control over the industry. Stations chose their own broadcasting locations, signal strengths, and frequencies, which sometimes overlapped with one another or with the military, leading to tuning problems for listeners. The Radio Act (1927) created the Federal Radio Commission (FRC), which made the first effort to set standards, frequencies, and license stations. The Commission was under heavy pressure from Congress, however, and had little authority. The Communications Act of 1934 ended the FRC and created the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which continued to work with radio stations to assign frequencies and set national standards, as well as oversee other forms of broadcasting and telephones. The FCC regulates interstate communications to this day. For example, it prohibits the use of certain profane words during certain hours on public airwaves.

[.my2]
专业和业余无线电台的数量迅速增长。起初，政府对该行业的立法监管力度有限。各电台自行选择广播地点、信号强度和频率，这些频率有时会相互重叠，或与军用频率重叠，导致听众收听困难。1927 年的 《无线电法 》设立了联邦无线电委员会 (FRC)，该委员会首次尝试制定标准、频率和颁发电台许可证。然而，该委员会面临着来自国会的巨大压力，权力有限。1934 年的《通信法》终止了 FRC 的运作，并成立了联邦通信委员会 (FCC)。FCC 继续与各电台合作，分配频率并制定国家标准，同时还监管其他形式的广播和电话。时至今日，FCC 仍然负责监管州际通信。例如，它禁止在公共无线电波的特定时段使用某些不雅词汇。

Prior to WWII, radio frequencies were broadcast using amplitude modulation (AM). After WWII, frequency modulation (FM) broadcasting, with its wider signal bandwidth, provided clear sound with less static and became popular with stations wanting to broadcast speeches or music with high-quality sound. While radio’s importance for distributing news waned with the increase in television usage, it remained popular for listening to music, educational talk shows, and sports broadcasting. Talk stations began to gain ground in the 1980s on both AM and FM frequencies, restoring radio’s importance in politics. By the 1990s, talk shows had gone national, showcasing broadcasters like Rush Limbaugh and Don Imus.

[.my2]
二战前，无线电广播采用调幅（AM）技术。二战后，调频（FM）广播凭借更宽的信号带宽，提供更清晰、更少静电干扰的声音，受到希望以高品质音效播出演讲或音乐的电台的青睐。随着电视的普及，广播在新闻传播方面的重要性有所下降，但它仍然是收听音乐、教育类谈话节目和体育赛事的重要渠道。20 世纪 80 年代，谈话类电台在调幅和调频频段上都开始兴起，重新唤起了广播在政治领域的重要性。到了 20 世纪 90 年代，谈话类节目已走向全国，涌现出像拉什·林博和唐·伊姆斯这样的知名主持人。

In 1990, Sirius Satellite Radio began a campaign for FCC approval of satellite radio. The idea was to broadcast digital programming from satellites in orbit, eliminating the need for local towers. By 2001, two satellite stations had been approved for broadcasting. Satellite radio has greatly increased programming with many specialized offerings, such as channels dedicated to particular artists. It is generally subscription-based and offers a larger area of coverage, even to remote areas such as deserts and oceans. Satellite programming is also exempt from many of the FCC regulations that govern regular radio stations. Howard Stern, for example, was fined more than $2 million while on public airwaves, mainly for his sexually explicit discussions.38 Stern moved to Sirius Satellite in 2006 and has since been free of oversight and fines.

[.my2]
1990 年，天狼星卫星广播公司（Sirius Satellite Radio）开始争取美国联邦通信委员会（FCC）批准卫星广播。其理念是通过轨道卫星广播数字节目，从而无需本地发射塔。到 2001 年，已有两家卫星广播电台获得批准。卫星广播极大地丰富了节目内容，并提供许多特色频道，例如专门播放特定艺术家的频道。卫星广播通常采用订阅制，覆盖范围更广，甚至包括沙漠和海洋等偏远地区。此外，卫星广播节目也不受 FCC 对普通广播电台的诸多监管。例如，霍华德·斯特恩（Howard Stern）曾在公共广播电台播出节目，因其露骨的性话题而被罚款超过 200 万美元。 38 斯特恩于 2006 年转投天狼星卫星广播公司，此后便不再受监管和罚款。

In a related vein, which speaks to the blurring of radio with the internet, is the explosion in podcasting. These audio shows, which are usually original but can be recorded versions of existing radio programs, explore a variety of topics and are enjoyed by millions of people around the world. They are especially popular for those who commute to and from work, but can be enjoyed anywhere, anytime. Total U.S. podcast listeners are a whopping 106.7 million, with 77.9 million listening to a podcast at least once per week. According to Business Insider: "A proliferation of shows, involvement from celebrity talent, investment from large companies like Spotify, and the spread of technologies that boost awareness, like smart speakers, have all helped podcast growth."39 Podcasts with celebrity hosts include those offered by Anna Faris, Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, and John Oliver.40
与此相关的，也体现了广播与互联网界限的模糊化，播客的爆炸式增长便是例证。这些音频节目通常是原创内容，但也可能是现有广播节目的录制版本，它们探讨各种主题，并受到全球数百万人的喜爱。播客尤其受到上下班通勤者的欢迎，但实际上，人们可以随时随地收听。美国播客听众总数高达 1.067 亿，其中 7790 万人每周至少收听一次播客。据《商业内幕》报道：“节目数量的激增、名人参与、Spotify 等大型公司的投资，以及智能音箱等提升公众认知度的技术的普及，都促进了播客的发展。” 39 名人主持的播客节目包括安娜·法瑞丝、瑞奇·热维斯、斯蒂芬·默钱特和约翰·奥利弗的节目。 40

TELEVISION  电视
Television combined the best attributes of radio and pictures and changed media forever. The first official broadcast in the United States was President Franklin Roosevelt’s speech at the opening of the 1939 World’s Fair in New York. The public did not immediately begin buying televisions, but coverage of World War II changed their minds. CBS reported on war events and included pictures and maps that enhanced the news for viewers. By the 1950s, the price of television sets had dropped, more televisions stations were being created, and advertisers were buying up spots.

[.my2]
电视融合了广播和图像的优点，彻底改变了媒体格局。美国首次正式播出的电视是富兰克林·罗斯福总统在 1939 年纽约世界博览会开幕式上的讲话。公众并没有立即开始购买电视机，但二战的报道改变了他们的想法。哥伦比亚广播公司（CBS）报道战争事件，并配以图片和地图，使新闻对观众更加生动。到了 20 世纪 50 年代，电视机的价格下降，电视台数量激增，广告商也开始大量购买广告位。

As on the radio, quiz shows and games dominated the television airwaves. But when Edward R. Murrow made the move to television in 1951 with his news show See It Now, television journalism gained its foothold (Figure 8.9). As television programming expanded, more channels were added. Networks such as ABC, CBS, and NBC began nightly newscasts, and local stations and affiliates followed suit.

[.my2]
与广播节目一样，问答节目和游戏节目也曾主导电视节目。但 1951 年，爱德华·R·默罗携新闻节目 《现在就看》（See It Now ）进军电视界，电视新闻才真正站稳脚跟（ 图 8.9 ）。随着电视节目的扩展，频道数量也随之增加。ABC、CBS 和 NBC 等电视网开始播出晚间新闻节目，地方电视台和附属电视台也纷纷效仿。

图 8.9 爱德华·R·默罗转战电视界，提高了电视新闻的知名度。在上图所示的 《思想的挑战》（1961 年）节目中，默罗与约翰·韦恩等电影明星一起探讨了苏联和美国之间的冷战。
Even more than radio, television allows politicians to reach out and connect with citizens and voters in deeper ways. Before television, few voters were able to see a president or candidate speak or answer questions in an interview. Now everyone can decode body language and tone to decide whether candidates or politicians are sincere. Presidents can directly convey their anger, sorrow, or optimism during addresses.

[.my2]
电视比广播更能让政治人物以更深入的方式与民众和选民沟通交流。在电视出现之前，很少有选民能够亲眼看到总统或候选人发表讲话或接受采访。如今，每个人都能通过解读肢体语言和语气来判断候选人或政治人物是否真诚。总统们可以在讲话中直接表达他们的愤怒、悲伤或乐观。

The first television advertisements, run by presidential candidates Dwight D. Eisenhower and Adlai Stevenson in the early 1950s, were mainly radio jingles with animation or short question-and-answer sessions. In 1960, John F. Kennedy’s campaign used a Hollywood-style approach to promote his image as young and vibrant. The Kennedy campaign ran interesting and engaging ads, featuring Kennedy, his wife Jacqueline, and everyday citizens who supported him.

[.my2]
20 世纪 50 年代初，总统候选人德怀特·D·艾森豪威尔和阿德莱·史蒂文森投放的首批电视广告，主要是一些带有动画或简短问答环节的广播广告歌曲。1960 年，约翰·F· 肯尼迪的竞选团队采用了好莱坞式的宣传手法，力图塑造他年轻活力的形象。肯尼迪竞选团队投放了一系列引人入胜的广告，广告中不仅有肯尼迪本人、他的妻子杰奎琳，还有支持他的普通民众。

Television was also useful to combat scandals and accusations of impropriety. Republican vice presidential candidate Richard Nixon used a televised speech in 1952 to address accusations that he had taken money from a political campaign fund illegally. Nixon laid out his finances, investments, and debts and ended by saying that the only election gift the family had received was a cocker spaniel the children named Checkers.41 The “Checkers speech” was remembered more for humanizing Nixon than for proving he had not taken money from the campaign account. Yet it was enough to quiet accusations. Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro similarly used television to answer accusations in 1984, holding a televised press conference to answer questions for over two hours about her husband’s business dealings and tax returns.42
电视在应对丑闻和不当行为指控方面也发挥了作用。1952 年，共和党副总统候选人理查德· 尼克松利用电视讲话回应了有关他非法挪用竞选资金的指控。尼克松详细列出了自己的财务状况、投资和债务，最后表示，他们家收到的唯一一份选举礼物是一只可卡犬，孩子们给它取名为“棋子”（Checkers）。 41 这段“棋子讲话”之所以为人所铭记，更多的是因为它将尼克松塑造成了一个更有人情味的人物，而不是因为它证明了尼克松没有挪用竞选资金。然而，它足以平息这些指控。1984 年，民主党副总统候选人杰拉尔丁·费拉罗也同样利用电视回应了指控，她举行了一场电视新闻发布会，就其丈夫的商业交易和纳税申报表等问题回答了两个多小时的问题。 42

In addition to television ads, the 1960 election also featured the first televised presidential debate. By that time most households had a television. Kennedy’s careful grooming and practiced body language allowed viewers to focus on his presidential demeanor. His opponent, Richard Nixon, was still recovering from a severe case of the flu. While Nixon’s substantive answers and debate skills made a favorable impression on radio listeners, viewers’ reaction to his sweaty appearance and obvious discomfort demonstrated that live television had the potential to make or break a candidate.43 In 1964, Lyndon B. Johnson was ahead in the polls, and he let Barry Goldwater’s campaign know he did not want to debate.44 Nixon, who ran for president again in 1968 and 1972, declined to debate. Then in 1976, President Gerald Ford, who was behind in the polls, invited Jimmy Carter to debate, and televised debates became a regular part of future presidential campaigns.45
除了电视广告，1960 年的总统大选还出现了首次电视直播的总统辩论。当时大多数家庭都拥有电视机。肯尼迪精心打扮，肢体语言娴熟，让观众能够专注于他的总统风范。他的对手理查德·尼克松当时仍在从一场严重的流感中恢复。尽管尼克松的实质性回答和辩论技巧给广播听众留下了良好的印象，但观众对他满头大汗和明显不适的反应表明，电视直播有可能决定一位候选人的成败。 43 1964 年，林登·约翰逊在民调中领先，他告知巴里·戈德华特的竞选团队，他不想参加辩论。 44 尼克松在 1968 年和 1972 年再次竞选总统，但他拒绝参加辩论。1976 年，民调落后的杰拉尔德·福特总统邀请吉米·卡特参加辩论，电视辩论从此成为未来总统竞选的常规环节。 45

Between the 1960s and the 1990s, presidents often used television to reach citizens and gain support for policies. When they made speeches, the networks and their local affiliates carried them. With few independent local stations available, a viewer had little alternative but to watch. During this “Golden Age of Presidential Television,” presidents had a strong command of the media.46
从 20 世纪 60 年代到 90 年代，总统们经常利用电视与民众沟通，争取对政策的支持。他们发表讲话时，各大电视网及其地方附属电视台都会播出。由于当时独立的地方电视台寥寥无几，观众几乎别无选择，只能收看电视。在这个“总统电视黄金时代”，总统们对媒体拥有强大的掌控力 。46

Some of the best examples of this power occurred when presidents used television to inspire and comfort the population during a national emergency. These speeches aided in the “rally ’round the flag” phenomenon, which occurs when a population feels threatened and unites around the president.47 During these periods, presidents may receive heightened approval ratings, in part due to the media’s decision about what to cover.48 In 1995, President Bill Clinton comforted and encouraged the families of the employees and children killed at the bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal Building. Clinton reminded the nation that children learn through action, and so we must speak up against violence and face evil acts with good acts.49
这种力量的最佳例证之一，是总统在国家紧急状态下利用电视鼓舞和安抚民众。这些讲话促成了“团结在国旗周围”现象，即当民众感到受到威胁时，便会团结在总统周围。 47 在这些时期，总统的支持率可能会上升，部分原因是媒体决定报道哪些内容。 48 1995 年，比尔· 克林顿总统安慰并鼓励了在俄克拉荷马城联邦大楼爆炸案中遇难的员工和儿童的家属。克林顿提醒全国，孩子们通过行动学习，因此我们必须反对暴力，以善行对抗邪恶。 49

Following the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington on September 11, 2001, President George W. Bush’s bullhorn speech from the rubble of Ground Zero in New York similarly became a rally. Bush spoke to the workers and first responders and encouraged them, but his short speech became a viral clip demonstrating the resilience of New Yorkers and the anger of a nation.50 He told New Yorkers, the country, and the world that Americans could hear the frustration and anguish of New York, and that the terrorists would soon hear the United States (Figure 8.10).

[.my2]
2001 年 9 月 11 日纽约和华盛顿遭受恐怖袭击后，乔治·W·布什总统在纽约世贸中心遗址用扩音器发表的讲话同样成为了一场声势浩大的集会。 布什向工人和救援人员发表讲话，鼓励他们，但他的简短讲话却迅速传播开来，成为一段广为流传的视频，展现了纽约人的坚韧和整个国家的愤怒。 50 他告诉纽约人、全国乃至全世界，美国人能够感受到纽约人的沮丧和痛苦，恐怖分子很快也会感受到美国的声音（ 图 8.10 ）。

Figure   数字 8.10 Presidents Clinton and Bush were both called upon to calm the people after mass killings. In April 1996, President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton lay flowers at the site of the former Alfred P. Murrah federal building just before the one-year anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing (a). Three days after the terrorist attacks of 9/11 brought down the World Trade Center in New York City, George W. Bush declares to the crowd, “I can hear you! The rest of the world hears you! And the people . . . and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon!” (b)
克林顿总统和布什总统都曾在大规模枪击事件后被要求安抚民众。1996 年 4 月，在俄克拉荷马城爆炸案一周年纪念日前夕，比尔·克林顿总统和第一夫人希拉里·罗德姆·克林顿在原阿尔弗雷德·P·默拉联邦大楼遗址敬献鲜花（a）。9·11 恐怖袭击摧毁纽约世界贸易中心三天后，乔治·W·布什向人群宣布：“我能听到你们的声音！全世界都能听到你们的声音！那些……那些摧毁这些大楼的人，很快也会听到我们所有人的声音！”（b）
Following their speeches, both presidents also received a bump in popularity. Clinton’s approval rating rose from 46 to 51 percent, and Bush’s from 51 to 90 percent.51
演讲结束后，两位总统的支持率均有所上升。克林顿的支持率从 46%升至 51%，布什的支持率则从 51 %升至 90%。

NEW MEDIA TRENDS  新媒体趋势
The invention of cable in the 1980s and the expansion of the Internet in the 2000s opened up more options for media consumers than ever before. Viewers can watch nearly anything at the click of a button, bypass commercials, and record programs of interest. The resulting saturation, or inundation of information, may lead viewers to abandon the news entirely or become more suspicious and fatigued about politics.52 This effect, in turn, also changes the president’s ability to reach out to citizens. For example, viewership of the president’s annual State of the Union address has decreased over the years, from sixty-seven million viewers in 1993 to thirty-two million in 2015.53 Citizens who want to watch reality television and movies can easily avoid the news, leaving presidents with no sure way to communicate with the public.54 Other voices, such as those of talk show hosts and political pundits, now fill the gap.

[.my2]
20 世纪 80 年代有线电视的发明和 21 世纪初互联网的普及，为媒体消费者提供了前所未有的更多选择。观众只需点击一下按钮，几乎可以观看任何内容，跳过广告，并录制感兴趣的节目。由此产生的信息饱和或信息过载，可能导致观众完全放弃新闻，或者对政治更加怀疑和厌倦。 52 反过来，这种效应也改变了总统与民众沟通的能力。例如，总统年度国情咨文的收视率逐年下降，从 1993 年的 6700 万观众下降到 2015 年的 3200 万观众。 53 想看真人秀和电影的民众可以轻易地避开新闻，这使得总统失去了与公众沟通的有效途径。 54 如今，脱口秀主持人、政治评论员等其他声音填补了这一空白。

Electoral candidates have also lost some media ground. In horse-race coverage, modern journalists analyze campaigns and blunders or the overall race, rather than interviewing the candidates or discussing their issue positions. Some argue that this shallow coverage is a result of candidates’ trying to control the journalists by limiting interviews and quotes. In an effort to regain control of the story, journalists begin analyzing campaigns without input from the candidates.55 The use of social media by candidates provides a countervailing trend. President Trump’s hundreds of election tweets in 2016 are the stuff of legend. He continued to tweet with gusto as president and during the 2020 election, at times surprising even those who worked for him with the subject areas being tweeted about. The presidential tweet replaced the presidential press conference. In the wake of the January 6th insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, Twitter closed down Trump's account after he repeatedly raised topics and points that were of questionable veracity. Facebook and Instagram also followed suit with their own bans. Trump's access was eventually restored by all three organizations. 56
选举候选人在媒体上的影响力也有所下降。在竞选报道中，现代记者分析的是竞选活动、失误或整体选情，而不是采访候选人或讨论他们的政策立场。有人认为，这种浅薄的报道是候选人试图通过限制采访和引述来控制记者的结果。为了重新掌控新闻，记者开始在没有候选人参与的情况下分析竞选活动。 55 候选人对社交媒体的使用则带来了一种反向趋势。特朗普总统在 2016 年大选期间发布的数百条推文堪称传奇。他担任总统期间以及在 2020 年大选期间仍然热情地发布推文，有时他推文的主题甚至让其幕僚都感到惊讶。总统推文取代了总统新闻发布会。在 1 月 6 日美国国会大厦发生骚乱后，特朗普的推特账号被关闭，因为他多次发表一些真实性存疑的话题和观点。脸书和 Instagram 也纷纷效仿，封禁了他的账号。最终，这三个组织都恢复了特朗普的访问权限 。56

Milestone  里程碑
The First Social Media Candidate
首位社交媒体候选人
When president-elect Barack Obama admitted an addiction to his Blackberry, the signs were clear: A new generation was assuming the presidency.57 Obama’s use of technology was a part of life, not a campaign pretense. Perhaps for this reason, he was the first candidate to fully embrace social media.

[.my2]
当当选总统巴拉克· 奥巴马承认自己沉迷于黑莓手机时，种种迹象表明：新一代总统即将接班。 57 奥巴马使用科技产品是其生活的一部分，而非竞选时的伪装。或许正因如此，他成为首位全面拥抱社交媒体的总统候选人。

While John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential candidate, focused on traditional media to run his campaign, Obama did not. One of Obama’s campaign advisors was Chris Hughes, a cofounder of Facebook. The campaign allowed Hughes to create a powerful online presence for Obama, with sites on YouTube, Facebook, MySpace, and more. Podcasts and videos were available for anyone looking for information about the candidate. These efforts made it possible for information to be forwarded easily between friends and colleagues. It also allowed Obama to connect with a younger generation that was often left out of politics.

[.my2]
2008 年共和党总统候选人约翰·麦凯恩的竞选策略侧重于传统媒体，而奥巴马则不然。奥巴马的竞选顾问之一是 Facebook 联合创始人克里斯·休斯。休斯利用奥巴马在 YouTube、Facebook、MySpace 等平台上的账号，为他打造了强大的网络影响力。任何想要了解奥巴马信息的人都可以通过播客和视频找到他。这些举措使得信息能够在朋友和同事之间轻松传播，也让奥巴马得以与那些常常被排除在政治之外的年轻一代建立联系。

By Election Day, Obama’s skill with the web was clear: he had over two million Facebook supporters, while McCain had 600,000. Obama had 112,000 followers on Twitter, and McCain had only 4,600.58
到选举日，奥巴马在网络方面的才能显露无疑：他在脸书上拥有超过两百万的支持者，而麦凯恩只有六十万。奥巴马在推特上拥有十一万两千名粉丝，而麦凯恩只有四千六百名 。58

Are there any disadvantages to a presidential candidate’s use of social media and the Internet for campaign purposes? Why or why not?
总统候选人利用社交媒体和互联网进行竞选活动是否存在任何弊端？为什么？

The availability of the Internet and social media has moved some control of the message back into the presidents’ and candidates’ hands. Politicians can now connect to the people directly, bypassing journalists. When Barack Obama’s minister, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, was accused of making inflammatory racial sermons in 2008, Obama used YouTube to respond to charges that he shared Wright’s beliefs. The video drew more than seven million views.59 To reach out to supporters and voters, the White House maintains a YouTube channel and a Facebook site, as did the recent Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner.

[.my2]
互联网和社交媒体的普及使总统和候选人重新掌握了部分信息控制权。政治人物现在可以绕过记者直接与民众沟通。2008 年，巴拉克·奥巴马的牧师杰里迈亚·赖特被指控发表煽动性的种族布道，奥巴马利用 YouTube 回应了有关他与赖特持有相同观点的指控。该视频的点击量超过 700 万次。 59 为了与支持者和选民沟通，白宫维护着一个 YouTube 频道和一个 Facebook 页面，前任共和党籍众议院议长约翰·博纳也曾这样做过。

Social media, like Facebook, also placed journalism in the hands of citizens: citizen journalism occurs when citizens use their personal recording devices and cell phones to capture events and post them on the Internet. In 2012, citizen journalists caught both presidential candidates by surprise. Mitt Romney was taped by a bartender’s personal camera saying that 47 percent of Americans would vote for President Obama because they were dependent on the government.60 Obama was recorded by a Huffington Post volunteer saying that some Midwesterners “cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren’t like them” due to their frustration with the economy.61 More recently, as Donald Trump was trying to close out the fall 2016 campaign, his musings about having his way with women were revealed on the infamous Billy Bush Access Hollywood tape. These statements became nightmares for the campaigns. As journalism continues to scale back and hire fewer professional writers in an effort to control costs, citizen journalism may become the new normal.62
社交媒体，例如 Facebook，也将新闻报道的权力交到了公民手中： 公民新闻指的是公民使用个人录音设备和手机记录事件并发布到互联网上。2012 年，公民记者让两位总统候选人都措手不及。米特·罗姆尼被一位酒吧招待用私人摄像头录下，他说 47%的美国人会投票给奥巴马总统，因为他们依赖政府。 60 奥巴马则被 《赫芬顿邮报》 的一位志愿者录下，他说一些中西部居民因为对经济感到不满，“所以会紧紧抓住枪支、宗教或对与他们不同的人抱有敌意”。 61 更近期的例子是，在唐纳德·特朗普试图结束 2016 年秋季竞选之际，他关于随心所欲与女性发生关系的言论被曝光在臭名昭著的比利·布什“走进好莱坞”录音带中。这些言论成了竞选活动的噩梦。随着新闻业为了控制成本而不断缩减规模并减少专业撰稿人的聘用，公民新闻或许会成为新的常态。 62

Another shift in the new media is a change in viewers’ preferred programming. Younger viewers like there to be humor in their news. In terms of TV, the popularity of The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and Last Week Tonight With Jon Oliver demonstrate that news, even political news, can win young viewers if delivered well.63 Such soft news presents news in an entertaining and approachable manner, painlessly introducing a variety of topics. While the depth or quality of reporting may be less than ideal, these shows can sound an alarm as needed to raise citizen awareness (Figure 8.11).64 Many young viewers also get their fun news from social media networks, such as TikTok, Twitter, and Instagram.

[.my2]
新媒体的另一个变化是观众偏好节目的改变。年轻观众喜欢在新闻中融入幽默元素。就电视而言，《崔弗·诺亚每日秀》 （The Daily Show with Trevor Noah）、 《斯蒂芬·科尔伯特深夜秀》（The Late Show with Stephen Colbert ）和 《乔恩·奥利弗上周今夜秀》（Last Week Tonight With Jon Oliver） 的流行表明，如果呈现方式得当，新闻，即使是政治新闻，也能赢得年轻观众的喜爱。 63 这种 “软新闻 ”以娱乐性和易于理解的方式呈现新闻，轻松引入各种话题。虽然报道的深度或质量可能不够理想，但这些节目可以在必要时发出警示，提高公民意识（ 图 8.11 ）。 64 许多年轻观众也通过社交媒体网络，例如 TikTok、Twitter 和 Instagram，获取轻松有趣的新闻。

Viewers who watch or listen to programs like John Oliver’s Last Week Tonight are more likely to be aware and observant of political events and foreign policy crises than they would otherwise be.65 They may view opposing party candidates more favorably because the low-partisan, friendly interview styles allow politicians to relax and be conversational rather than defensive.66 Because viewers of political comedy shows watch the news frequently, they may, in fact, be more politically knowledgeable than citizens viewing national news. In two studies researchers interviewed respondents and asked knowledge questions about current events and situations. Viewers of The Daily Show scored more correct answers than viewers of news programming and news stations.67 That being said, it is not clear whether the number of viewers is large enough to make a big impact on politics, nor do we know whether the learning is long term or short term.68
观看或收听约翰·奥利弗《 上周今夜秀》 等节目的观众，比一般观众更有可能了解和关注政治事件和外交政策危机。 65 他们可能对反对党候选人持更积极的态度，因为这种低党派、友好的访谈风格让政治人物能够放松下来，以对话而非防御的姿态与人交流。 66 由于政治喜剧节目的观众经常观看新闻，他们实际上可能比观看国家新闻的公民拥有更丰富的政治知识。在两项研究中，研究人员采访了受访者，并询问了他们有关时事和形势的知识问题。 《每日秀》 的观众比新闻节目和新闻频道的观众答对的题目更多。 67 尽管如此，目前尚不清楚观众人数是否足够多，足以对政治产生重大影响，我们也不知道这种学习是长期的还是短期的。 68

Becoming a Citizen Journalist
成为一名公民记者
Local government and politics need visibility. College students need a voice. Why not become a citizen journalist? City and county governments hold meetings on a regular basis and students rarely attend. Yet issues relevant to students are often discussed at these meetings, like increases in street parking fines, zoning for off-campus housing, and tax incentives for new businesses that employ part-time student labor. Attend some meetings, ask questions, and write about the experience on your Facebook page. Create a blog to organize your reports or use Storify to curate a social media debate. If you prefer videography, create a YouTube channel to document your reports on current events, or Tweet your live video using Periscope or Meerkat.

[.my2]
地方政府和政治需要提高透明度。大学生也需要发声。何不成为一名公民记者呢？市县政府定期召开会议，但学生很少参加。然而，这些会议经常讨论与学生息息相关的问题，例如提高路边停车罚款、校外住房的规划以及雇用学生兼职的新企业的税收优惠。参加一些会议，提出问题，并将你的经历写在你的 Facebook 页面上。创建一个博客来整理你的报道，或者使用 Storify 来策划社交媒体上的讨论。如果你更喜欢视频，可以创建一个 YouTube 频道来记录你对时事的报道，或者使用 Periscope 或 Meerkat 发布你的实时视频。

Not interested in government? Other areas of governance that affect students are the university or college’s Board of Regents meetings. These cover topics like tuition increases, class cuts, and changes to student conduct policies. If your state requires state institutions to open their meetings to the public, consider attending. You might be the one to notify your peers of changes that affect them.

[.my2]
对政府事务不感兴趣？影响学生的其他治理领域还包括大学或学院的理事会会议。这些会议涵盖学费上涨、课程削减和学生行为准则变更等议题。如果你的州要求州立院校向公众开放会议，不妨考虑参加。你或许能成为将影响同学们的政策变化告知他们的人。
