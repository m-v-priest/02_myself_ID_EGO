== 释义




Frameworks and theories help us make sense of the environment of governance in a complex area like foreign policy. A variety of schools of thought exist about how to approach foreign policy, each with different ideas about what “should” be done. These approaches also vary in terms of what they assume about human nature, how many other countries ought to be involved in U.S. foreign policy, and what the tenor of foreign policymaking ought to be. They help us situate the current U.S. approach to many foreign policy challenges around the world.

框架和理论有助于我们理解外交政策等复杂领域的治理环境。关于如何制定外交政策，存在着多种思想流派，每种流派都对“应该”做什么有着不同的见解。这些方法在对人性的假设、美国外交政策应涉及多少其他国家以及外交政策制定的基调等方面也存在差异。它们有助于我们理解美国当前应对全球诸多外交政策挑战的方式。

CLASSIC APPROACHES  经典方法
A variety of traditional concepts of foreign policy remain helpful today as we consider the proper role of the United States in, and its approach to, foreign affairs. These include isolationism, the idealism versus realism debate, liberal internationalism, hard versus soft power, and the grand strategy of U.S. foreign policy.

[.my2]
在思考美国在外交事务中应扮演的角色及其外交方针时，许多传统的外交政策概念在今天仍然具有借鉴意义。这些概念包括孤立主义、理想主义与现实主义之争、自由国际主义、硬实力与软实力之争，以及美国外交政策的大战略。

From the end of the Revolutionary War in the late eighteenth century until the early twentieth century, isolationism—whereby a country stays out of foreign entanglements and keeps to itself—was a popular stance in U.S. foreign policy. Among the founders, Thomas Jefferson especially was an advocate of isolationism or non-involvement. He thought that by keeping to itself, the United States stood a better chance of becoming a truly free nation. This fact is full of irony, because Jefferson later served as ambassador to France and president of the United States, both roles that required at least some attention to foreign policy. Still, Jefferson’s ideas had broad support. After all, Europe was where volatile changes were occurring. The new nation was tired of war, and there was no reason for it to be entangled militarily with anyone. Indeed, in his farewell address, President George Washington famously warned against the creation of “entangling alliances.”17
从十八世纪末美国独立战争结束到二十世纪初， 孤立主义 ——即一个国家不卷入外国纷争，保持自身独立——是美国外交政策中一种流行的立场。在开国元勋中，托马斯 ·杰斐逊尤其拥护孤立主义或不干涉主义。他认为，通过保持自身独立，美国更有可能成为一个真正自由的国家。这颇具讽刺意味，因为杰斐逊后来担任了美国驻法国大使和美国总统，这两个职位都需要他关注外交政策。尽管如此，杰斐逊的理念仍然得到了广泛的支持。毕竟，当时的欧洲正经历着剧烈的变革。这个新生国家厌倦了战争，没有理由与任何国家陷入军事纠葛。事实上，乔治·华盛顿总统在其告别演说中曾发出著名的警告，告诫人们不要缔结“纠缠不清的联盟”。 17

Despite this legacy, the United States was pulled squarely into world affairs with its entry into World War I. But between the Armistice in 1918 that ended that war and U.S. entry into World War II in 1941, isolationist sentiment returned, based on the idea that Europe should learn to govern its own affairs. Then, after World War II, the United States engaged the world stage as one of two superpowers and the military leader of Europe and the Pacific. Isolationism never completely went away, but now it operated in the background. Again, Europe seemed to be the center of the problem, while political life in the United States seemed calmer somehow.

[.my2]
尽管有着这样的历史渊源，美国还是因卷入第一次世界大战而被彻底卷入了世界事务。然而，从1918年结束第一次世界大战的停战协定到1941年美国加入第二次世界大战之间，孤立主义情绪再次抬头，其核心思想是欧洲应该学会自主管理自身事务。二战结束后，美国作为两大超级大国之一，以及欧洲和太平洋地区的军事领导者，重新活跃于世界舞台。孤立主义从未完全消失，但如今已退居幕后。欧洲似乎再次成为问题的中心，而美国的政治生活则显得平静许多。

The end of the Cold War opened up old wounds as a variety of smaller European countries sought independence and old ethnic conflicts reappeared. Some in the United States felt the country should again be isolationist as the world settled into a new political arrangement, including a vocal senator, Jesse Helms (R-NC), who was against the United States continuing to be the military “policeman” of the world. Helms was famous for opposing nearly all treaties brought to the Senate during his tenure. Congressman Ron Paul (R-TX) and his son Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) were both isolationist candidates for the presidency (in 2008 and 2016, respectively); both thought the United States should retreat from foreign entanglements, spend far less on military and foreign policy, and focus more on domestic issues.

[.my2]
冷战的结束揭开了旧伤疤，许多欧洲小国寻求独立，旧有的民族冲突再次浮现。在美国，一些人认为随着世界格局逐渐稳定，国家应该再次奉行孤立主义，其中包括一位直言不讳的参议员杰西· 赫尔姆斯 （北卡罗来纳州共和党籍）。赫尔姆斯反对美国继续扮演世界军事“警察”的角色。赫尔姆斯以在其任期内几乎反对所有提交参议院的条约而闻名。众议员罗恩 ·保罗 （德克萨斯州共和党籍）和他的儿子、参议员兰德·保罗（肯塔基州共和党籍）都曾是孤立主义总统候选人（分别在 2008 年和 2016 年）；他们都认为美国应该从海外卷入纷争，大幅削减军事和外交开支，并将更多精力放在国内事务上。

At the other end of the spectrum is liberal internationalism. Liberal internationalism advocates a foreign policy approach in which the United States becomes proactively engaged in world affairs. Its adherents assume that liberal democracies must take the lead in creating a peaceful world by cooperating as a community of nations and creating effective world structures such as the United Nations. To fully understand liberal internationalism, it is helpful to understand the idealist versus realist debate in international relations. Idealists assume the best in others and see it as possible for countries to run the world together, with open diplomacy, freedom of the seas, free trade, and no militaries. Everyone will take care of each other. There is an element of idealism in liberal internationalism, because the United States assumes other countries will also put their best foot forward. A classic example of a liberal internationalist is President Woodrow Wilson, who sought a League of Nations to voluntarily save the world after World War I.

[.my2]
光谱的另一端是自由国际主义 。自由国际主义倡导一种外交政策，在这种政策下，美国积极参与世界事务。其拥护者认为，自由民主国家必须发挥领导作用，通过国际社会合作，建立有效的国际组织（例如联合国），来创造一个和平的世界。为了充分理解自由国际主义，了解国际关系中的理想主义与现实主义之争至关重要。理想主义者相信其他国家都心怀善意，认为各国可以携手共建世界，实行开放的外交、海洋自由、自由贸易，并且不建立军队。他们认为，各国会互相扶持。自由国际主义中也包含理想主义的成分，因为美国相信其他国家也会尽力而为。伍德罗· 威尔逊总统就是一位典型的自由国际主义者，他在第一次世界大战后寻求建立国际联盟 ，以期通过自愿行动拯救世界。

Realists assume that others will act in their own self-interest and hence cannot necessarily be trusted. They want a healthy military and contracts between countries in case others want to wiggle out of their commitments. Realism also has a place in liberal internationalism, because the United States approaches foreign relationships with open eyes and an emphasis on self-preservation.

[.my2]
现实主义者假定他人会出于自身利益行事，因此未必值得信任。他们希望拥有健全的军事力量，并希望各国之间签订条约，以防他国试图逃避承诺。现实主义在自由国际主义中也占有一席之地，因为美国在处理对外关系时秉持开放的态度，并强调自身利益的维护。

Soft power, or diplomacy, with which the United States often begins a foreign policy relationship or entanglement, is in line with liberal internationalism and idealism, while hard power, which allows the potential for military force, is the stuff of realism. For example, at first the United States was rather isolationist in its approach to China, assuming it was a developing country of little impact that could safely be ignored. Then President Nixon opened up China as an area for U.S. investment, and an era of open diplomatic relations began in the early 1970s (Figure 17.16). As China modernized and began to dominate the trade relationship with the United States, many came to see it through a realist lens and to consider whether China’s behavior really warranted its beneficial most-favored-nation trading status.

[.my2]
美国通常以软实力或外交手段开启外交关系或介入，这符合自由国际主义和理想主义；而硬实力，即动用武力的可能性，则体现了现实主义。例如，美国最初对华采取孤立主义政策，认为中国是一个影响力有限的发展中国家，可以置之不理。后来，尼克松总统将中国开放为美国投资区域，两国于 20 世纪 70 年代初开启了开放的外交关系时代（ 图 17.16 ）。随着中国现代化进程的推进，以及其在中美贸易关系中占据主导地位，许多人开始以现实主义的视角看待中国，并质疑中国的行为是否真的配得上其享有的最惠国待遇。

The final classic idea of foreign policy is the so-called grand strategy—employing all available diplomatic, economic, and military resources to advance the national interest. The grand strategy invokes the possibility of hard power, because it relies on developing clear strategic directions for U.S. foreign policy and the methods to achieve those goals, often with military capability attached. The U.S. foreign policy plan in Europe and Asia after World War II reflects a grand strategy approach. In order to stabilize the world, the United States built military bases in Italy, Germany, Spain, England, Belgium, Japan, Guam, and Korea. It still operates nearly all these, though often under a multinational arrangement such as NATO. These bases help preserve stability on the one hand, and U.S. influence on the other.

[.my2]
外交政策的最后一个经典理念是所谓的“大战略”——运用一切可用的外交、经济和军事资源来推进国家利益。大战略涉及硬实力，因为它依赖于为美国外交政策制定清晰的战略方向以及实现这些目标的方法，而这些方法往往伴随着军事能力。二战后美国在欧洲和亚洲的外交政策计划体现了大战略方针。为了稳定世界局势，美国在意大利、德国、西班牙、英国、比利时、日本、关岛和韩国建立了军事基地。尽管通常是在北约等多边合作机制下运作，但美国至今仍在几乎所有这些基地开展工作。这些基地一方面有助于维护稳定，另一方面也有助于提升美国的影响力。

MORE RECENT SCHOOLS OF THOUGHTS
近期出现的其他思想流派
Two particular events in foreign policy caused many to change their views about the proper approach to U.S. involvement in world affairs. First, the debacle of U.S. involvement in the civil war in Vietnam in the years leading up to 1973 caused many to rethink the country’s traditional containment approach to the Cold War. Containment was the U.S. foreign policy goal of limiting the spread of communism. In Vietnam the United States supported one governing faction within the country (democratic South Vietnam), whereas the Soviet Union supported the opposing governing faction (communist North Vietnam). The U.S. military approach of battlefield engagement did not translate well to the jungles of Vietnam, where “guerilla warfare” predominated.

[.my2]
外交政策中的两件大事促使许多人改变了对美国参与世界事务的正确方式的看法。首先，1973 年前后美国介入越南内战的惨败，使许多人重新思考美国在冷战中奉行的传统遏制政策。遏制政策是美国旨在限制共产主义扩张的外交政策目标。在越南，美国支持越南的一个执政派别（民主的南越），而苏联则支持对立的执政派别（共产主义的北越）。美国在战场上采取的军事策略并不适用于以“游击战”为主的越南丛林。

Skeptics became particularly pessimistic about liberal internationalism given how poorly the conflict in Vietnam had played out. U.S. military forces withdrew from South Vietnam in 1973, and Saigon, its capital, fell to North Vietnam and the communists eighteen months later. Many of those pessimists then became neoconservatives on foreign policy.

[.my2]
鉴于越南战争的惨败，怀疑论者对自由国际主义尤其悲观。1973年，美军撤出南越，18个月后，南越首都西贡落入北越和共产党之手。许多悲观主义者随后在外交政策上转变为新保守主义者。

Neoconservatives believe that rather than exercising restraint and always using international organizations as the path to international outcomes, the United States should aggressively use its might to promote its values and ideals around the world. The aggressive use (or threat) of hard power is the core value of neoconservatism. Acting unilaterally is acceptable in this view, as is adopting a preemptive strategy in which the United States intervenes militarily before the enemy can make its move. Preemption is a new idea; the United States has tended to be retaliatory in its use of military force, as in the case of Pearl Harbor at the start of World War II. Examples of neoconservativism in action are the 1980s U.S. campaigns in Central American countries to turn back communism under President Ronald Reagan, the Iraq War of 2003 led by President George W. Bush and his vice president Dick Cheney (Figure 17.17), and the use of drones as counterterrorism weapons during the Obama administration.

[.my2]
新保守主义者认为，美国不应保持克制，也不应总是依赖国际组织来解决国际问题，而应积极运用自身实力在全球范围内推广其价值观和理念。积极运用（或威胁运用）硬实力是新保守主义的核心价值观。在这种观点看来，单边行动是可以接受的，采取先发制人的战略——即美国在敌人采取行动之前进行军事干预——也是可以接受的。先发制人是一种新概念；美国以往倾向于以报复性军事行动来应对，例如二战初期偷袭珍珠港。新保守主义的实际例子包括：20 世纪 80 年代，美国在罗纳德·里根总统领导下在中美洲国家开展的旨在遏制共产​​主义的军事行动；2003 年，由乔治·W·布什总统及其副总统迪克·切尼领导的伊拉克战争（ 图 17.17 ）；以及奥巴马政府时期使用无人机作为反恐武器。

Neo-isolationism, like earlier isolationism, advocates keeping free of foreign entanglements. Yet no advanced industrial democracy completely separates itself from the rest of the world. Foreign markets beckon, tourism helps spur economic development at home and abroad, and global environmental challenges require cross-national conversation. In the twenty-first century, neo-isolationism means distancing the United States from the United Nations and other international organizations that get in the way. The strategy of selective engagement—retaining a strong military presence and remaining engaged across the world through alliances and formal installations—is used to protect the national security interests of the United States. However, this strategy also seeks to avoid being the world’s police officer.

[.my2]
新孤立主义与早期的孤立主义一样，主张避免卷入外国事务。然而，没有哪个发达工业民主国家能够完全与世隔绝。海外市场充满吸引力，旅游业有助于促进国内外经济发展，而全球环境挑战也需要跨国对话。在 21 世纪， 新孤立主义意味着美国要与联合国和其他阻碍其发展的国际组织保持距离。 选择性参与战略——即保持强大的军事存在，并通过联盟和正式机构参与全球事务——被用来保护美国的国家安全利益。然而，这一战略也力求避免扮演世界警察的角色。

The second factor that changed minds about twenty-first century foreign policy is the rise of elusive new enemies who defy traditional designations. Rather than countries, these enemies are terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIS (or ISIL) that spread across national boundaries. A hybrid approach to U.S. foreign policy that uses multiple schools of thought as circumstances warrant may thus be the wave of the future. President Obama often took a hybrid approach. In some respects, he was a liberal internationalist seeking to put together broad coalitions to carry out world business. At the same time, his sending teams of troops and drones to take out terrorist targets in other legitimate nation-states without those states’ approval fits with a neoconservative approach. Finally, his desire to not be the “world’s police officer” led him to follow a practice of selective engagement.

[.my2]
改变人们对21世纪外交政策看法的第二个因素是难以捉摸的新型敌人的崛起，这些敌人难以被传统定义。这些敌人并非国家，而是像基地组织和伊斯兰国（或称伊拉克和黎凡特伊斯兰国）这样的恐怖组织，它们跨越国界蔓延。因此，根据形势需要运用多种思路的美国外交政策混合模式，或许将成为未来的发展趋势。奥巴马总统经常采取这种混合策略。在某些方面，他是一位自由国际主义者，致力于组建广泛的联盟来处理国际事务。与此同时，他未经其他合法国家同意，派遣部队和无人机打击其境内的恐怖目标，这又符合新保守主义的做法。最后，他不愿扮演“世界警察”的角色，因此采取了选择性介入的策略。

U.S. FOREIGN POLICY IN THE COLD WAR AND WITH CHINA
冷战时期及对华美外交政策
The foreign policy environment from the end of World War II until the end of the Cold War in 1990 was dominated by a duel of superpowers between the United States and its Western allies on the one hand and the Soviet Union and the communist bloc of countries in the East on the other. Both superpowers developed thousands of weapons of mass destruction and readied for a potential world war to be fought with nuclear weapons. That period was certainly challenging and ominous at times, but it was simpler than the present era. Nations knew what team they were on, and there was generally an incentive to not go to war because it would lead to the unthinkable—the end of the Earth as we know it, or mutually assured destruction. The result of this logic, essentially a standoff between the two powers, is sometime referred to as nuclear deterrence.

[.my2]
从二战结束到 1990 年冷战结束，美国的外交政策环境主要由美国及其西方盟友与苏联及其东方共产主义阵营之间的超级大国博弈主导。这两个超级大国都研发了数千种大规模杀伤性武器，并为可能爆发的核武器世界大战做好了准备。那段时期固然充满挑战，有时甚至令人担忧，但与当今时代相比，情况要简单得多。各国都清楚自己属于哪一方，而且普遍存在避免战争的动机，因为战争会导致难以想象的后果——地球毁灭，或者相互确保摧毁。这种逻辑的结果，本质上是两大超级大国之间的对峙，有时被称为核威慑。

When the Soviet Union imploded and the Cold War ended, it was in many ways a victory for the West and for democracy. However, once the bilateral nature of the Cold War was gone, dozens of countries sought independence and old ethnic conflicts emerged in several regions of the world, including Eastern Europe. This new era holds great promise, but it is in many ways more complex than the Cold War. The rise of cross-national terrorist organizations further complicates the equation because the enemy hides within the borders of potentially dozens of countries around the globe. In summary, the United States pursues a variety of topics and goals in different areas of the world in the twenty-first century.

[.my2]
苏联解体、冷战结束，在许多方面都是西方和民主的胜利。然而，随着冷战双边性质的瓦解，数​​十个国家寻求独立，包括东欧在内的世界多个地区也出现了由来已久的民族冲突。这个新时代充满希望，但在许多方面也比冷战时期更为复杂。跨国恐怖组织的崛起进一步加剧了局势的复杂性，因为敌人可能藏身于全球数十个国家的境内。总而言之，美国在21世纪于世界各地追求着各种各样的目标和议题。

The Soviet Union dissolved into many component parts after the Cold War, including Russia, various former Soviet republics like Georgia and Ukraine, and smaller nation-states in Eastern Europe, such as the Czech Republic. The general approach of the United States has been to encourage the adoption of democracy and economic reforms in these former Eastern bloc countries. Many of them now align with the EU and even with the West’s cross-national military organization, NATO. With freedoms can come conflict, and there has been much of that in these fledgling countries as opposition coalitions debate how the future course should be charted, and by whom. Under President Vladimir Putin, Russia is again trying to strengthen its power on the country’s western border, testing expansionism while invoking Russian nationalism. The United States is adopting a defensive position and trying to prevent the spread of Russian influence. The EU and NATO factor in here from the standpoint of an internationalist approach. U.S.-Russia relations have been frosty since Putin ascended, save for President Trump's initial efforts to befriend him. President Biden took a more emphatic stand with Russia on issues of wrongdoing and especially questions regarding Russian influence in the 2016 and 2020 elections. During the early part of the Trump Presidency, he was more assertive toward Russia and Putin in efforts to end the war in Ukraine. While Trump seemed prepared to support Russia retaining the land it had occupied in the war, he also repeatedly criticized Russia, and issued sharp statements against Putin, particularly after Russian attacks targeting and killing civilians.

[.my2]
冷战结束后，苏联解体为多个组成部分，包括俄罗斯 、格鲁吉亚和乌克兰等前苏联加盟共和国，以及捷克等东欧小国。美国的总体方针是鼓励这些前东欧集团国家推行民主和经济改革。如今，其中许多国家加入了欧盟，甚至加入了西方的跨国军事组织北约。自由往往伴随着冲突，这些新兴国家也因此饱受冲突之苦，反对派联盟就未来发展方向以及由谁来主导展开了激烈的辩论。在弗拉基米尔· 普京总统的领导下，俄罗斯再次试图加强其在西部边境的影响力，在煽动俄罗斯民族主义的同时试探扩张主义。美国则采取防御姿态，试图阻止俄罗斯影响力的扩张。从国际主义的角度来看，欧盟和北约在此扮演着重要角色。自普京上台以来，美俄关系一直处于冷淡状态，除了特朗普总统最初试图与他建立友好关系之外。拜登总统在俄罗斯的不当行为问题上，尤其是在俄罗斯干预 2016 年和 2020 年大选的问题上，对俄罗斯采取了更为强硬的立场。而在特朗普总统执政初期，他为了结束乌克兰战争，对俄罗斯和普京的态度则更为强硬。尽管特朗普似乎准备支持俄罗斯保留其在战争中占领的领土，但他同时也多次批评俄罗斯，并发表了措辞严厉的声明谴责普京，尤其是在俄罗斯发动袭击并造成平民伤亡之后。

In many ways the more visible future threat to the United States is China, the potential rival superpower of the future. A communist state that has also encouraged much economic development, China has been growing and modernizing for more than thirty years. Its nearly 1.4 billion citizens are stepping onto the world economic stage with other advanced industrial nations. In addition to fueling an explosion of industrial domestic development, public and private Chinese investors have spread their resources to every continent and most countries of the world. Indeed, Chinese investors lend money to the United States government on a regular basis, as U.S. domestic borrowing capacity is pushed to the limit in most years.

[.my2]
在许多方面，对美国而言，更显而易见的未来威胁来自中国 ，这个未来潜在的超级大国竞争对手。作为一个共产主义国家，中国大力推动经济发展，三十多年来持续增长并不断现代化。其近 14 亿人口正与其他发达工业国家一起登上世界经济舞台。除了推动国内工业的爆炸式增长外，中国公共和私人投资者已将其资源扩展到各大洲和世界大多数国家。事实上，由于美国国内借贷能力在大多数年份都接近极限，中国投资者经常向美国政府提供贷款。

Many in the United States are worried by the lack of freedom and human rights in China. During the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing on June 4, 1989, thousands of pro-democracy protestors were arrested and many were killed as Chinese authorities fired into the crowd and tanks crushed people who attempted to wall them out. Over one thousand more dissidents were arrested in the following weeks as the Chinese government investigated the planning of the protests in the square. The United States instituted minor sanctions for a time, but President George H. W. Bush chose not to remove the most-favored-nation trading status of this long-time economic partner. Most in the U.S. government, including leaders in both political parties, wish to engage China as an economic partner at the same time that they keep a watchful eye on its increasing influence around the world, especially in developing countries. President Trump, on the other hand, was assertive in Asia, imposing a series of tariffs designed particularly to hit goods imported from China. The relationship with China therefore became quite strained under President Trump, and President Biden has continued to raise tough questions about and take tough stances on China. This souring relationship has negatively impacted U.S. universities where several Confucius Institutes have been shut down.

[.my2]
许多美国人对中国缺乏自由和人权感到担忧。1989 年 6 月 4 日，北京天安门广场发生惨案，数千名民主示威者被捕，许多人被杀害。中国当局向人群开枪，坦克碾压试图用围墙阻挡示威者的人群。在接下来的几周里，又有超过一千名异议人士被捕，中国政府也对广场抗议活动的策划展开调查。美国一度对中国实施了轻微制裁，但老布什总统选择不取消这个长期经济伙伴的最惠国待遇。美国政府的大多数官员，包括两党领导人，都希望与中国保持经济伙伴关系，同时密切关注中国在全球，尤其是在发展中国家日益增长的影响力。另一方面，特朗普总统在亚洲采取了强硬立场，对一系列从中国进口的商品加征关税。因此，在特朗普总统执政期间，美中关系变得相当紧张，而拜登总统也继续对中国提出尖锐问题并采取强硬立场。这种恶化的关系对美国大学产生了负面影响，导致多所孔子学院被关闭。

Elsewhere in Asia, the United States has good relationships with most other countries, especially South Korea and Japan, which have both followed paths the United States favored after World War II. Both countries embraced democracy, market-oriented economies, and the hosting of U.S. military bases to stabilize the region. North Korea, however, is another matter. A closed, communist, totalitarian regime, North Korea has been testing nuclear bombs in recent decades, to the concern of the rest of the world. Here, again, President Trump has been assertive, challenging the North Koreans to come to the bargaining table. It is an open question how much change this assertiveness will achieve, but it is significant that a dialogue has actually begun. Like China many decades earlier, India is a developing country with a large population that is expanding and modernizing. Unlike China, India has embraced democracy, especially at the local level.

[.my2]
在亚洲其他地区，美国与大多数国家保持着良好的关系，尤其是韩国和日本。二战后，两国都选择了美国所支持的道路。两国都拥抱了民主、市场经济，并允许美国在其境内设立军事基地以维护地区稳定。然而，朝鲜的情况则截然不同。作为一个封闭的共产主义极权政权，朝鲜近几十年来一直在进行核试验，这引起了世界其他国家的担忧。对此，特朗普总统再次采取了强硬立场，敦促朝鲜回到谈判桌前。这种强硬态度究竟能带来多大的改变尚待观察，但对话的真正开启意义重大。与几十年前的中国类似，印度也是一个人口众多、正在快速发展和现代化的发展中国家。与中国不同的是，印度已经拥抱了民主，尤其是在地方层面。
