== 释义





It is easy to imagine that when designers engineer a product, like a car, they do so with the intent of satisfying the consumer. But the design of any complicated product must take into account the needs of regulators, transporters, assembly line workers, parts suppliers, and myriad other participants in the manufacture and shipment process. And manufacturers must also be aware that consumer tastes are fickle: A gas-guzzling sports car may appeal to an unmarried twenty-something with no children; but what happens to product satisfaction when gas prices fluctuate, or the individual gets married and has children?
不难想象，设计师在设计产品（例如汽车）时，其目的是为了满足消费者的需求。但任何复杂产品的设计都必须考虑到监管机构、运输商、装配线工人、零部件供应商以及制造和运输过程中其他众多参与者的需求。制造商还必须意识到，消费者的口味瞬息万变：一辆耗油量大的跑车或许会吸引一位没有孩子的二十多岁单身人士；但当油价波动，或者这个人结婚生子后，他对产品的满意度又会如何变化呢？

In many ways, the process of designing domestic policy isn’t that much different. The government, just like auto companies, needs to ensure that its citizen-consumers have access to an array of goods and services. And just as in auto companies, a wide range of actors is engaged in figuring out how to do it. Sometimes, this process effectively provides policies that benefit citizens. But just as often, the process of policymaking is muddied by the demands of competing interests with different opinions about society’s needs or the role that government should play in meeting them. To understand why, we begin by thinking about what we mean by the term “public policy.”
在许多方面，国内政策的制定过程与汽车公司并无太大区别。政府和汽车公司一样，都需要确保公民消费者能够获得各种各样的商品和服务。同样，也需要众多参与者共同探讨如何实现这一目标。有时，这一过程能够有效地制定出惠及民众的政策。但更多时候，政策制定过程会因各方利益的冲突而变得复杂，这些利益对社会需求或政府在满足这些需求方面应扮演的角色持有不同意见。为了理解个中缘由，我们首先需要思考“公共政策”一词的含义。

PUBLIC POLICY DEFINED  公共政策的定义
One approach to thinking about public policy is to see it as the broad strategy government uses to do its job. More formally, it is the relatively stable set of purposive governmental actions that address matters of concern to some part of society.1 This description is useful in that it helps to explain both what public policy is and what it isn’t. First, public policy is a guide to legislative action that is more or less fixed for long periods of time, not just short-term fixes or single legislative acts. Policy also doesn’t happen by accident, and it is rarely formed simply as the result of the campaign promises of a single elected official, even the president. While elected officials are often important in shaping policy, most policy outcomes are the result of considerable debate, compromise, and refinement that happen over years and are finalized only after input from multiple institutions within government as well as from interest groups and the public.

思考公共政策的一种方法是将其视为政府履行职责的总体战略。更正式地说，它是政府为解决社会某些群体关注的问题而采取的一系列相对稳定的、有目的的行动 。¹ 这种描述有助于解释公共政策的本质及其不包含的内容。首先，公共政策是指导立法行动的指南，它在较长时期内基本保持不变，而不仅仅是短期措施或单一的立法行为。政策的制定并非偶然，也很少仅仅源于某位民选官员（即使是总统）的竞选承诺。虽然民选官员在政策制定过程中通常发挥着重要作用，但大多数政策结果都是经过多年反复辩论、妥协和完善的结果，并且只有在征求了政府内部多个机构、利益集团和公众的意见后才能最终确定。

Consider the example of health care expansion. A follower of politics in the news media may come away thinking the reforms implemented in 2010 were as sudden as they were sweeping, having been developed in the final weeks before they were enacted. The reality is that expanding health care access had actually been a priority of the Democratic Party for several decades. What may have seemed like a policy developed over a period of months was in fact formed after years of analysis, reflection upon existing policy, and even trial implementation of similar types of programs at the state level. Even before passage of the ACA (2010), which expanded health care coverage to millions, and of the HCERA (2010), more than 50 percent of all health care expenditures in the United States already came from federal government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Several House and Senate members from both parties along with First Lady Hillary Clinton had proposed significant expansions in federal health care policy during the Democratic administration of Bill Clinton, providing a number of different options for any eventual health care overhaul.2 Much of what became the ACA was drawn from proposals originally developed at the state level, by none other than Obama’s 2012 Republican presidential opponent Mitt Romney when he was governor of Massachusetts.3
以医疗保健覆盖面的扩大为例。关注新闻媒体政治报道的人可能会认为，2010 年实施的改革既突然又全面，仿佛是在颁布前的最后几周才匆匆制定完成的。但事实上，扩大医疗保健覆盖面一直是民主党几十年来一直优先考虑的事项。这项看似在几个月内制定的政策，实际上是经过多年分析、反思现有政策，甚至在州一级试行类似项目后形成的。早在《平价医疗法案》（ACA，2010 年）和《医疗保健支出和调整法案》（HCERA，2010 年）通过之前，美国超过 50%的医疗保健支出就已经来自联邦政府的项目，例如联邦医疗保险（Medicare）和联邦医疗补助（Medicaid）。在比尔·克林顿执政期间，包括第一夫人希拉里·克林顿在内的多位众议院和参议院议员，都曾提出大幅扩大联邦医疗保健政策的方案，为最终的医疗保健改革提供了多种选择。 2 《平价医疗法案》（ACA）中的许多内容都源自州一级提出的提案，而这些提案的提出者正是奥巴马 2012 年共和党总统候选人竞选对手米特·罗姆尼，当时他是马萨诸塞州州长 。3

In addition to being thoughtful and generally stable, public policy deals with issues of concern to some large segment of society, as opposed to matters of interest only to individuals or a small group of people. Governments frequently interact with individual actors like citizens, corporations, or other countries. They may even pass highly specialized pieces of legislation, known as private bills, which confer specific privileges on individual entities. But public policy covers only those issues that are of interest to larger segments of society or that directly or indirectly affect society as a whole. Paying off the loans of a specific individual would not be public policy, but creating a process for loan forgiveness available to certain types of borrowers (such as those who provide a public service by becoming teachers) would certainly rise to the level of public policy.

[.my2]
公共政策不仅需要深思熟虑且通常保持稳定，它还关注社会中相当一部分人所关心的问题，而非仅仅与个人或少数群体相关。政府经常与公民、企业或其他国家等个体主体互动。政府甚至可能通过高度专业化的立法，即所谓的私人法案，赋予特定实体特定的特权。但公共政策仅涵盖那些与社会更广泛群体相关或直接或间接影响整个社会的问题。为特定个人偿还贷款并非公共政策，但为某些类型的借款人（例如从事公共服务的教师）制定贷款减免流程则无疑属于公共政策的范畴。

A final important characteristic of public policy is that it is more than just the actions of government; it also includes the behaviors or outcomes that government action creates. Policy can even be made when government refuses to act in ways that would change the status quo when circumstances or public opinion begin to shift.4 For example, much of the debate over gun safety policy in the United States has centered on the unwillingness of Congress to act, even in the face of public opinion that supports some changes to gun policy. In fact, one of the last major changes occurred in 2004, when lawmakers’ inaction resulted in the expiration of a piece of legislation known as the Federal Assault Weapons Ban (1994).5
公共政策的最后一个重要特征是，它不仅仅是政府的行为；它还包括政府行为所产生的行为或结果。即使政府拒绝采取行动来改变现状，而此时形势或公众舆论开始转变，政策本身也可能存在问题。⁴ 例如，美国关于枪支安全政策的大部分辩论都集中在国会不愿采取行动的问题上，即便公众舆论支持对枪支政策进行一些改革。事实上，最近一次重大变革发生在 2004 年，当时立法者的不作为导致一项名为《 联邦攻击性武器禁令》 （1994 年）的法案失效 。⁵

PUBLIC POLICY AS OUTCOMES
公共政策作为结果
Governments rarely want to keep their policies a secret. Elected officials want to be able to take credit for the things they have done to help their constituents, and their opponents are all too willing to cast blame when policy initiatives fail. We can therefore think of policy as the formal expression of what elected or appointed officials are trying to accomplish. In passing the HCERA (2010), Congress declared its policy through an act that directed how it would appropriate money. The president can also implement or change policy through an executive order, which offers instructions about how to implement law under the president's discretion (Figure 16.2). Finally, policy changes can come as a result of court actions or opinions, such as Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954), which formally ended school segregation in the United States.6
政府很少会想把政策保密。民选官员希望能够将他们为选民所做的工作归功于自己，而他们的对手则非常乐意在政策失败时指责他们。因此，我们可以将政策视为民选或任命官员试图实现的目标的正式表达。国会通过《2010 年高等教育改革法案》（HCERA）时，通过一项指导拨款方式的法案宣布了其政策。总统也可以通过行政命令来实施或改变政策，行政命令就如何在总统的自由裁量权范围内执行法律作出指示（ 图 16.2 ）。最后，政策的改变也可能源于法院的诉讼或判决，例如布朗诉托皮卡教育委员会案 （1954 年），该案正式结束了美国的学校种族隔离制度。 6

Typically, elected and even high-ranking appointed officials lack either the specific expertise or tools needed to successfully create and implement public policy on their own. They turn instead to the vast government bureaucracy to provide policy guidance. For example, when Congress passed the Clean Water Act (1972), it dictated that steps should be taken to improve water quality throughout the country. But it ultimately left it to the bureaucracy to figure out exactly how ‘clean’ water needed to be. In doing so, Congress provided the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with discretion to determine how much pollution is allowed in U.S. waterways.

[.my2]
通常情况下，民选官员乃至高级委任官员都缺乏独立制定和实施公共政策所需的专业知识或工具。他们转而求助于庞大的政府机构来提供政策指导。例如，国会通过《 清洁水法》 （1972 年）时，规定应采取措施改善全国水质。但最终，如何界定“清洁”水质的标准却交由政府机构来决定。国会赋予了环境保护署（EPA）极大的自由裁量权，由其决定美国水道允许的污染程度。

There is one more way of thinking about policy outcomes: in terms of winners and losers. Almost by definition, public policy promotes certain types of behavior while punishing others. So, the individuals or corporations that a policy favors are most likely to benefit, or win, whereas those the policy ignores or punishes are likely to lose. Even the best-intended policies can have unintended consequences and may even ultimately harm someone, if only those who must pay for the policy through higher taxes. A policy designed to encourage students to go to liberal arts colleges may cause trade school enrollment to decline. Strategies to promote diversity in higher education may make it more difficult for qualified White or male applicants to get accepted into competitive programs. Efforts to clean up drinking water supplies may make companies less competitive and cost employees their livelihood. Even something that seems to help everyone, such as promoting charitable giving through tax incentives, runs the risk of lowering tax revenues from the rich (who contribute a greater share of their income to charity) and shifting tax burdens to the poor (who must spend a higher share of their income to achieve a desired standard of living). And while policy pronouncements and bureaucratic actions are certainly meant to rationalize policy, it is whether a given policy helps or hurts constituents (or is perceived to do so) that ultimately determines how voters will react toward the government in future elections.

[.my2]
还有一种思考政策结果的方式：从赢家和输家的角度来看待。几乎从定义上讲，公共政策会鼓励某些行为，同时惩罚其他行为。因此，政策所偏袒的个人或企业最有可能受益或获胜，而政策所忽视或惩罚的人则可能遭受损失。即使是初衷最好的政策也可能产生意想不到的后果，甚至最终可能损害某些人的利益，即使只是那些必须通过增加税收来为政策买单的人。一项旨在鼓励学生就读文科院校的政策可能会导致职业学校入学人数下降。旨在促进高等教育多样性的策略可能会使合格的白人或男性申请者更难被竞争激烈的项目录取。治理饮用水供应的努力可能会降低企业的竞争力，并导致员工失去生计。即使是看似惠及所有人的政策，例如通过税收优惠鼓励慈善捐赠，也存在降低富人税收（因为他们将更大比例的收入用于慈善事业）并将税收负担转移到穷人身上（因为他们必须花费更高比例的收入才能达到理想的生活水平）的风险。虽然政策声明和官僚机构的行动旨在使政策合理化，但最终决定选民在未来选举中如何对待政府的，是某项政策究竟是帮助了选民还是损害了选民（或者选民认为它损害了选民）。

The Social Safety Net
社会安全网
During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the United States created a set of policies and programs that constituted a social safety net for the millions who had lost their jobs, their homes, and their savings (Figure 16.3). Under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the federal government began programs like the Work Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps to combat unemployment and the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation to refinance Depression-related mortgage debts. As the effects of the Depression eased, the government phased out many of these programs. Other programs, like Social Security or the minimum wage, remain an important part of the way the government takes care of the vulnerable members of its population. The federal government has also added further social support programs, like Medicaid, Medicare, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, to ensure a baseline or minimal standard of living for all, even in the direst of times.

在 20 世纪 30 年代的大萧条时期，美国制定了一系列政策和计划，为数百万失去工作、住房和积蓄的人们构建了一张社会安全网（ 图 16.3 ）。在富兰克林·德拉诺 ·罗斯福总统的领导下，联邦政府启动了诸如工程振兴署（WPA）和民间资源保护队（CCC）等项目，以应对失业问题；同时还成立了房主贷款公司（HOLC），为大萧条时期的抵押贷款债务提供再融资。随着大萧条的影响逐渐缓解，政府逐步取消了许多此类项目。而诸如社会保障或最低工资等其他项目，仍然是政府照顾弱势群体的重要组成部分。此外，联邦政府还增设了医疗补助（Medicaid）、医疗保险（Medicare）以及妇女、婴儿和儿童特别营养补充计划（WIC）等社会支持项目，以确保即使在最艰难的时期，所有人都能享有基本的生活水平。

In recent decades, however, some have criticized these safety net programs for inefficiency and for incentivizing welfare dependence. They deride “government leeches” who use food stamps to buy lobster or other seemingly inappropriate items. Critics deeply resent the use of taxpayer money to relieve social problems like unemployment and poverty; workers who may themselves be struggling to put food on the table or pay the mortgage feel their hard-earned money should not support other families. “If I can get by without government support,” the reasoning goes, “those welfare families can do the same. Their poverty is not my problem.”
然而，近几十年来，一些人批评这些社会保障项目效率低下，并助长了人们对福利的依赖。他们嘲讽那些用食品券购买龙虾或其他看似不合适的物品的“政府寄生虫”。批评者对用纳税人的钱来缓解失业和贫困等社会问题深感不满；那些自己可能都在为温饱或偿还房贷而挣扎的劳动者认为，他们辛辛苦苦挣来的钱不应该用来帮助其他家庭。“如果我不需要政府援助就能过得去，”他们的理由是，“那些需要福利的家庭也能做到。他们的贫困与我无关。”

So where should the government draw the line? While there have been some instances of welfare fraud, the welfare reforms of the 1990s have made long-term dependence on the federal government less likely as the welfare safety net was pushed to the states. And with the income gap between the richest and the poorest at its highest level in history, this topic is likely to continue to receive much discussion in the coming years.

那么，政府应该如何划定界限呢？虽然福利欺诈事件时有发生，但上世纪90年代的福利改革已将福利保障体系下放至各州，从而降低了人们长期依赖联邦政府的可能性。鉴于目前贫富差距已达到历史最高水平，这一话题在未来几年很可能仍会引发广泛讨论。

Where is the middle ground in the public policy argument over the social safety net? How can the government protect its most vulnerable citizens without placing an undue burden on others?
在关于社会保障体系的公共政策争论中，中间立场在哪里？政府如何在不给其他人造成过重负担的情况下保护最弱势的公民？
