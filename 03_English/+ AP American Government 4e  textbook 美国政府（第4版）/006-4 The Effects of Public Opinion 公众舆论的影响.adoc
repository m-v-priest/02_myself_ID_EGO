== 释义



Public opinion polling is prevalent even outside election season. Are politicians and leaders listening to these polls, or is there some other reason for them? Some believe the increased collection of public opinion is due to growing support of delegate representation. The theory of delegate representation assumes the politician is in office to be the voice of the people.90 If voters want the legislator to vote for legalizing marijuana, for example, the legislator should vote to legalize marijuana. Legislators or candidates who believe in delegate representation may poll the public before an important vote comes up for debate in order to learn what the public desires them to do.

即使在选举季之外，民意调查也十分普遍。政客和领导人会听取这些民调结果吗？还是另有其他原因？一些人认为，民意调查的增加是由于人们对代表制的支持度不断提高。 代表制理论认为，政客的职责是代表人民发声。例如，如果选民希望立法者投票支持大麻合法化，那么立法者就应该投票支持。信奉代表制的立法者或候选人可能会在重要投票表决前进行民意调查，以了解公众的意愿。

Others believe polling has increased because politicians, like the president, operate in permanent campaign mode. To continue contributing money, supporters must remain happy and convinced the politician is listening to them. Even if the elected official does not act in a manner consistent with the polls, they can mollify everyone by explaining the reasons behind the vote.91
另一些人则认为民调支持率上升是因为像总统这样的政治人物一直处于竞选模式。为了继续捐款，支持者必须保持满意，并相信政治人物在倾听他们的声音。即使当选官员的行动与民调结果不符，他们也可以通过解释投票背后的原因来安抚所有人 。91

Regardless of why the polls are taken, studies have not clearly shown whether the branches of government consistently act on them. Some branches appear to pay closer attention to public opinion than other branches, but events, time periods, and politics may change the way an individual or a branch of government ultimately reacts.

无论民意调查的目的是什么，研究尚未明确表明政府各部门是否会始终如一地根据民意采取行动。一些部门似乎比其他部门更关注民意，但事件、时代背景和政治环境都可能改变个人或政府部门最终的反应方式。

PUBLIC OPINION AND ELECTIONS
公众舆论与选举
Elections are the events on which opinion polls have the greatest measured effect. Public opinion polls do more than show how we feel on issues or project who might win an election. The media use public opinion polls to decide which candidates are ahead of the others and therefore of interest to voters and worthy of interview. From the moment President Obama was inaugurated for his second term, speculation began about who would run in the 2016 presidential election. Within a year, potential candidates were being ranked and compared by a number of newspapers.92 The speculation included favorability polls on Hillary Clinton, which measured how positively voters felt about her as a candidate. The media deemed these polls important because they showed Clinton as the frontrunner for the Democrats in the next election.93
选举是民意调查影响最大的事件。民意调查的作用远不止于反映我们对各种议题的看法或预测谁可能赢得选举。媒体利用民意调查来判断哪些候选人领先于其他候选人，从而吸引选民的关注并值得采访。从奥巴马总统就职连任的那一刻起，关于谁将参加 2016 年总统大选的猜测就开始了。不到一年，许多报纸就开始对潜在候选人进行排名和比较。92 这些猜测包括对希拉里 ·克林顿的支持率民调 ， 该民调衡量了选民对她作为候选人的好感度。媒体认为这些民调很重要 ， 因为它们显示克林顿是民主党在下届选举中的领跑者 。93

During presidential primary season, we see examples of the bandwagon effect, in which the media pays more attention to candidates who poll well during the fall and the first few primaries. Bill Clinton was nicknamed the “Comeback Kid” in 1992, after he placed second in the New Hampshire primary despite accusations of adultery with Gennifer Flowers. The media’s attention on Clinton gave him the momentum to make it through the rest of the primary season, ultimately winning the Democratic nomination and the presidency.

[.my2]
在总统初选季，我们经常会看到“ 羊群效应 ”的例子，即媒体会更加关注那些在秋季民调和前几场初选中表现出色的候选人。比尔·克林顿在 1992 年新罕布什尔州初选中位列第二，尽管当时他被指控与詹妮弗·弗劳尔斯有染，但他仍然获得了这一成绩，因此被戏称为“王者归来”。媒体对克林顿的关注给了他继续前进的动力，最终赢得了民主党总统候选人提名和总统宝座。

Polling is also at the heart of horserace coverage, in which, just like an announcer at the racetrack, the media calls out every candidate’s move throughout the presidential campaign. It often includes near-constant reporting on polls (some of which have questionable validity), accompanied by commentary from election experts or spokespeople for the candidates. Sound bites, tweets, and video of campaign stops are frequently integrated into this somewhat surface-level reporting. Horserace coverage can be neutral, positive, or negative, depending upon what polls or facts are covered (Figure 6.16). During the 2012 presidential election, the Pew Research Center found that both Mitt Romney and President Obama received more negative than positive horserace coverage, with Romney’s growing more negative as he fell in the polls.94 Horserace coverage is often criticized for its lack of depth; the stories skip over the candidates’ issue positions, voting histories, and other facts that would help voters make an informed decision. Yet, horserace coverage is popular because the public is always interested in who will win, and it often makes up a third or more of news stories about the election.95 Exit polls, taken the day of the election, are the last election polls conducted by the media. Announced results of these surveys can deter voters from going to the polls if they believe the election has already been decided.

[.my2]
民调也是选情报道的核心，媒体就像赛马场的播音员一样，对总统竞选期间每位候选人的举动进行报道。报道通常包含近乎不间断的民调（其中一些民调的有效性值得怀疑），并配以选举专家或候选人发言人的评论。竞选集锦、推文和视频也经常被融入到这种略显肤浅的报道中。选情报道可以是中立的、正面的或负面的，这取决于报道的民调或事实（ 图 6.16 ）。在 2012 年总统大选期间，皮尤研究中心发现，米特· 罗姆尼和奥巴马总统都获得了更多负面的选情报道，而且随着罗姆尼民调支持率的下降，他的负面报道也越来越多。94 选情报道经常因缺乏深度而受到批评；报道往往忽略了候​​选人的政策立场、投票记录以及其他有助于选民做出明智选择的事实。 然而 ，选情报道之所以受欢迎，是因为公众总是关心谁会胜出，而且这类报道往往占到选举新闻报道的三分之一甚至更多。95 选举日当天进行的出口民调是媒体进行的最后一次选举民调。如果选民认为选举结果已经确定，那么这些民调结果的公布可能会让他们放弃投票。

Should Exit Polls Be Banned?
出口民调应该被禁止吗？
Exit polling seems simple. An interviewer stands at a polling place on Election Day and asks people how they voted. But the reality is different. Pollsters must select sites and voters carefully to ensure a representative and random poll. Some people refuse to talk and others may lie. The demographics of the polled population may lean more towards one party than another. Absentee and early voters cannot be polled. Despite these setbacks, exit polls are extremely interesting and controversial, because they provide early information about which candidate is ahead.

[.my2]
出口民调看似简单。选举日当天，一名调查员站在投票站，询问选民的投票意向。但实际情况并非如此。民调机构必须精心挑选投票站和选民，以确保民调的代表性和随机性。有些人拒绝接受采访，有些人则可能撒谎。受访人群的构成可能更倾向于某一党派。缺席投票者和提前投票者无法进行民调。尽管存在这些局限性，出口民调仍然非常有趣且极具争议性，因为它能提供关于哪位候选人领先的早期信息。

In 1985, a so-called gentleman’s agreement between the major networks and Congress kept exit poll results from being announced before a state’s polls closed.96 This tradition has largely been upheld, with most media outlets waiting until 7 p.m. or later to disclose a state’s returns. Internet and cable media, however, have not always kept to the agreement. Sources like Matt Drudge have been accused of reporting early, and sometimes incorrect, exit poll results.

[.my2]
1985 年，各大电视网与国会达成一项所谓的“君子协定”，规定在各州投票结束前不得公布出口民调结果 。96 这一惯例基本得到遵守，大多数媒体都会等到晚上 7 点或更晚才公布各州的选举结果。然而，互联网和有线电视媒体并非总是遵守这项协定。像马特·德拉吉这样的消息来源就被指控提前报道出口民调结果，有时甚至是错误的。

On one hand, delaying results may be the right decision. Studies suggest that exit polls can affect voter turnout. Reports of close races may bring additional voters to the polls, whereas apparent landslides may prompt people to stay home. Other studies note that almost anything, including bad weather and lines at polling places, dissuades voters. Ultimately, it appears exit poll reporting affects turnout by up to 5 percent.97
一方面，推迟公布结果或许是正确的决定。研究表明，出口民调会影响投票率。选情胶着的报道可能会促使更多选民前往投票站，而明显的压倒性胜利则可能导致人们选择待在家中。其他研究指出，几乎任何因素，包括恶劣天气和投票站排队，都会影响选民的投票意愿。最终，出口民调的报道似乎会对投票率产生高达 5%的影响 。97

On the other hand, limiting exit poll results means major media outlets lose out on the chance to share their carefully collected data, leaving small media outlets able to provide less accurate, more impressionistic results. And few states are affected anyway, since the media invest only in those where the election is close. Finally, an increasing number of voters are now voting up to two weeks early, and these numbers are updated daily without controversy.

[.my2]
另一方面，限制出口民调结果意味着主流媒体失去了分享其精心收集的数据的机会，使得小型媒体能够提供不太准确、更具印象式的结果。而且，受影响的州其实很少，因为媒体只会在选情胶着的州投入资源。最后，越来越多的选民现在提前两周投票，而且这些数据每天都会更新，并未引起争议。

What do you think? Should exit polls be banned? Why or why not?
你觉得呢？应该禁止出口民调吗？为什么？

Public opinion polls also affect how much money candidates receive in campaign donations. Donors assume public opinion polls are accurate enough to determine who the top two to three primary candidates will be, and they give money to those who do well. Candidates who poll at the bottom will have a hard time collecting donations, increasing the odds that they will continue to do poorly. This was apparent in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, and Martin O’Malley each campaigned in the hope of becoming the Democratic presidential nominee. In June 2015, 75 percent of Democrats likely to vote in their state primaries said they would vote for Clinton, while 15 percent of those polled said they would vote for Sanders. Only 2 percent said they would vote for O’Malley.98 During this same period, Clinton raised $47 million in campaign donations, Sanders raised $15 million, and O’Malley raised $2 million.99 By September 2015, 23 percent of likely Democratic voters said they would vote for Sanders,100 and his summer fundraising total increased accordingly.101
民意调查也会影响候选人获得的竞选捐款数额。捐款人通常认为民意调查足够准确，能够预测出初选的前两到三位候选人，因此他们会把钱捐给那些民调支持率高的候选人。而民调支持率低的候选人则很难筹集到捐款，这增加了他们最终表现不佳的可能性。2016 年总统大选前夕，这一点就显而易见。伯尼 ·桑德斯 、希拉里 ·克林顿和马丁 ·奥马利都曾竞选民主党总统候选人提名。2015 年 6 月，在可能参加州初选的民主党选民中，75%的人表示会投票给克林顿，15%的人表示会投票给桑德斯，只有 2%的人表示会投票给奥马利 。98 同期，克林顿筹集了 4700 万美元的竞选捐款，桑德斯筹集了 1500 万美元，而奥马利只筹集了 200 万美元。 99 到 2015 年 9 月，23%的民主党潜在选民表示他们会投票给桑德斯， 100 而他夏季的筹款总额也相应增加 。101

Presidents running for reelection also must perform well in public opinion polls, and being in office may not provide an automatic advantage. Americans often think about both the future and the past when they decide which candidate to support.102 They have three years of past information about the sitting president, so they can better predict what will happen if the incumbent is reelected. That makes it difficult for the president to mislead the electorate. Voters also want a future that is prosperous. Not only should the economy look good, but citizens want to know they will do well in that economy.103 For this reason, daily public approval polls sometimes act as both a referendum of the president and a predictor of success.

[.my2]
竞选连任的总统也必须在民意调查中表现出色，而身居要职并不一定能带来自动优势。美国民众在决定支持哪位候选人时，往往会同时考虑未来和过去。 102 他们掌握了现任总统过去三年的信息，因此能够更好地预测如果现任总统连任将会发生什么。这使得总统难以误导选民。选民也渴望一个繁荣的未来。不仅经济形势要好，民众也希望知道自己在这样的经济环境下能够过得好。 103 因此，每日民意调查有时既是对总统的一次公投，也是对其未来政绩的预测。

PUBLIC OPINION AND GOVERNMENT
公众舆论与政府
The relationship between public opinion polls and government action is murkier than that between polls and elections. Like the news media and campaign staffers, members of the three branches of government are aware of public opinion. But do politicians use public opinion polls to guide their decisions and actions?
民意调查与政府行动之间的关系比民调与选举之间的关系更为复杂。与新闻媒体和竞选工作人员一样，政府三大分支机构的成员都了解民意。但政治家们会利用民意调查来指导他们的决策和行动吗？

The short answer is “sometimes.” The public is not perfectly informed about politics, so politicians realize public opinion may not always be the right choice. Yet many political studies, from the American Voter in the 1920s to the American Voter Revisited in the 2000s, have found that voters behave rationally despite having limited information. Individual citizens do not take the time to become fully informed about all aspects of politics, yet their collective behavior and the opinions they hold as a group make sense. They appear to be informed just enough, using preferences like their political ideology and party membership, to make decisions and hold politicians accountable during an election year.

[.my2]
简而言之，答案是“有时”。公众对政治的了解并不全面，因此政治家们也意识到民意未必总是正确的选择。然而，从 20 世纪 20 年代的 《美国选民》 到 21 世纪初的《美国选民再探》 ，许多政治研究都发现，尽管信息有限，选民的行为依然理性。公民个人不会花时间去全面了解政治的方方面面，但他们的集体行为和群体观点却合情合理。他们似乎掌握了足够的信息，并根据政治意识形态和党派归属等偏好做出决策，从而在选举年监督政治家。

Overall, the collective public opinion of a country changes over time, even if party membership or ideology does not change dramatically. As James Stimson’s prominent study found, the public’s mood, or collective opinion, can become more or less liberal from decade to decade. While the initial study on public mood revealed that the economy has a profound effect on American opinion,104 further studies have gone beyond to determine whether public opinion, and its relative liberalness, in turn affect politicians and institutions. This idea does not argue that opinion never affects policy directly, rather that collective opinion also affects the politician’s decisions on policy.105
总体而言，即使党派归属或意识形态没有发生显著变化，一个国家的集体舆论也会随着时间推移而改变。正如詹姆斯·史汀生的著名研究发现，公众情绪或集体舆论可能会在几十年间变得更加自由或更加保守。虽然最初关于公众情绪的研究表明经济对美国舆论有着深远的影响， 但后续研究进一步探究了公众舆论及其相对自由化程度是否反过来影响政治家和制度 。 这种观点并非认为舆论永远不会直接影响政策，而是认为集体舆论也会影响政治家的政策决策。

Individually, of course, politicians cannot predict what will happen in the future or who will oppose them in the next few elections. They can look to see where the public is in agreement as a body. If public mood changes, the politicians may change positions to match the public mood. The more savvy politicians look carefully to recognize when shifts occur. When the public is more or less liberal, the politicians may make slight adjustments to their behavior to match. Politicians who frequently seek to win office, like House members, will pay attention to the long- and short-term changes in opinion. By doing this, they will be less likely to lose on Election Day.106 Presidents and justices, on the other hand, present a more complex picture.

[.my2]
当然，就个人而言，政治人物无法预测未来会发生什么，也无法预知未来几次选举中谁会是他们的对手。他们可以观察公众的整体共识。如果公众情绪发生变化，政治人物可能会调整立场以迎合民意。更精明的政治人物会仔细观察，捕捉民意转变的时机。当公众的政治倾向偏向自由派或保守派时，政治人物可能会对自己的行为做出细微调整以适应民意。像众议员这样经常竞选公职的政治人物，会密切关注民意的长期和短期变化。这样做可以降低他们在选举日落败的可能性。另一方面， 总统和大法官的情况则更为复杂。

Public opinion of the president is different from public opinion of Congress. Congress is an institution of 535 members, and opinion polls look at both the institution and its individual members. The president is both a person and the head of an institution. The media pays close attention to any president’s actions, and the public is generally well informed and aware of the office and its current occupant. Perhaps this is why public opinion has an inconsistent effect on presidents’ decisions. As early as Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration in the 1930s, presidents have regularly polled the public, and since Richard Nixon’s term (1969–1974), they have admitted to using polling as part of the decision-making process.

[.my2]
公众对总统的看法与对国会的看法有所不同。国会是一个由 535 名成员组成的机构，民意调查既关注该机构，也关注其每位成员。总统既是个人，也是一个机构的首脑。媒体密切关注任何一位总统的行动，公众通常对总统职位及其现任总统都非常了解。或许正因如此，公众舆论对总统决策的影响并不稳定。早在 20 世纪 30 年代富兰克林· 罗斯福执政时期，总统们就定期进行民意调查；而自理查德· 尼克松任期（1969-1974 年）以来，他们也承认将民意调查作为决策过程的一部分。

Presidential responsiveness to public opinion has been measured in a number of ways, each of which tells us something about the effect of opinion. One study examined whether presidents responded to public opinion by determining how often they wrote amicus briefs and asked the court to affirm or reverse cases. It found that the public’s liberal (or non-liberal) mood had an effect, causing presidents to pursue and file briefs in different cases.107 But another author found that the public’s level of liberalness is ignored when conservative presidents, such as Ronald Reagan or George W. Bush, are elected and try to lead. In one example, our five most recent presidents’ moods varied from liberal to non-liberal, while public sentiment stayed consistently liberal.108 While the public supported liberal approaches to policy, presidential action varied from liberal to non-liberal.

[.my2]
衡量总统对民意的回应程度的方法有很多，每一种方法都揭示了民意的影响。一项研究考察了总统是否回应民意，具体方法是统计他们撰写法庭之友意见陈述书并请求法院维持或推翻判决的频率。研究发现，公众的自由主义（或非自由主义）情绪会产生影响，导致总统在不同的案件中寻求并提交意见陈述书。 107 但另一位作者发现，当像罗纳德· 里根或乔治·W· 布什这样的保守派总统当选并试图执政时，公众的自由主义程度往往被忽视。例如，最近五位总统的情绪从自由主义到非自由主义不等，而公众情绪却始终保持自由主义。 108 虽然公众支持自由主义的政策方针，但总统的行动却呈现出自由主义和非自由主义的倾向。

Overall, it appears that presidents try to move public opinion towards personal positions rather than moving themselves towards the public’s opinion.109 If presidents have enough public support, they use their level of public approval indirectly as a way to get their agenda passed. Immediately following Inauguration Day, for example, the president enjoys the highest level of public support for implementing campaign promises. This is especially true if the president has a mandate, which is more than half the popular vote. Barack Obama’s recent 2008 victory was a mandate with 52.9 percent of the popular vote and 67.8 percent of the Electoral College vote.110 In contrast, President Donald Trump’s victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was a closer contest. While Clinton outdistanced him by 2.9 million votes nationally, after narrowly winning several states, Trump won a comfortable majority in the Electoral College. By the above definition, Democratic nominee Joe Biden's win over President Trump in 2020 was a mandate. Biden garnered 51.3 percent of the total votes cast, against Trump's 47 percent, and captured 306 Electoral College votes, winning by the same comfortable margin that Trump had four years earlier.

[.my2]
总体而言，总统们似乎更倾向于引导公众舆论支持自己的立场，而不是迎合公众舆论。 109 如果总统拥有足够的公众支持，他们会间接地利用公众支持率来推动其施政纲领的实施。例如，在就职典礼之后，总统享有最高的公众支持率，便于其兑现竞选承诺。如果总统拥有民意授权 （即超过半数的普选票），这种情况尤为明显。巴拉克· 奥巴马在 2008 年的胜选就是民意授权的结果，他获得了 52.9%的普选票和 67.8%的选举人团选票。 110 与之相比，唐纳德·特朗普总统战胜民主党候选人希拉里·克林顿的选情则更为胶着。尽管克林顿在全国范围内领先特朗普 290 万张选票，但在几个州险胜后，特朗普最终在选举人团中获得了绝对多数。根据上述定义，民主党候选人乔·拜登在 2020 年战胜特朗普总统也是民意授权的结果。拜登获得了 51.3% 的总选票，而特朗普获得了 47%，拜登赢得了 306 张选举人票，以与特朗普四年前相同的较大优势获胜。

When presidents have high levels of public approval, they are likely to act quickly and try to accomplish personal policy goals. They can use their position and power to focus media attention on an issue. This is sometimes referred to as the bully pulpit approach. The term “bully pulpit” was coined by President Theodore Roosevelt, who believed the presidency commanded the attention of the media and could be used to appeal directly to the people. Roosevelt used his position to convince voters to pressure Congress to pass laws.

[.my2]
当总统拥有很高的民意支持率时，他们往往会迅速采取行动，力图实现个人政策目标。他们可以利用自身的地位和权力，将媒体的注意力集中在某个问题上。这有时被称为“总统讲坛效应”。“总统讲坛效应”一词是由西奥多· 罗斯福总统创造的，他认为总统职位能够吸引媒体的关注，并可以用来直接诉诸民众。罗斯福利用自己的地位，说服选民向国会施压，促使其通过相关法案。

Increasing partisanship has made it more difficult for presidents to use their power to get their own preferred issues through Congress, however, especially when the president’s party is in the minority in Congress.111 For this reason, modern presidents may find more success in using their popularity to increase media and social media attention on an issue. Even if the president is not the reason for congressional action, they can cause the attention that leads to change.112
日益加剧的党派之争使得总统更难利用权力推动其所支持的议题在国会获得通过，尤其是在总统所在党派在国会处于少数地位的情况下。 111 因此，现代总统或许会发现，利用自身声望来提升媒体和社交媒体对某一议题的关注度更为有效。即便总统并非国会采取行动的直接原因，他们也能引发最终促成变革的关注。 112

Presidents may also use their popularity to ask the people to act. In October 2015, following a shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, President Obama gave a short speech from the West Wing of the White House (Figure 6.17). After offering his condolences and prayers to the community, he remarked that prayers and condolences were no longer enough, and he called on citizens to push Congress for a change in gun control laws. President Obama had proposed gun control reform following the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut, but it did not pass Congress. This time, the president asked citizens to use gun control as a voting issue and push for reform via the ballot box.

[.my2]
总统也可能利用自身的影响力呼吁民众采取行动。2015 年 10 月，俄勒冈州安普瓜社区学院发生枪击案后，奥巴马总统在白宫西翼发表了简短讲话（ 图 6.17 ）。在向遇难者家属表示慰问和祈祷后，他指出，仅仅表达慰问和祈祷已经远远不够，并呼吁民众敦促国会修改枪支管制法。奥巴马总统曾在 2012 年康涅狄格州桑迪胡克小学枪击案后提出过枪支管制改革方案，但该方案最终未能获得国会通过。这一次，总统呼吁民众将枪支管制问题作为投票议题，通过选票推动改革。

In some instances, presidents may appear to directly consider public opinion before acting or making decisions. In 2013, President Obama announced that he was considering a military strike on Syria in reaction to the Syrian government’s illegal use of sarin gas on its own citizens. Despite agreeing that this chemical attack on the Damascan suburbs was a war crime, the public was against U.S. involvement. Forty-eight percent of respondents said they opposed airstrikes, and only 29 percent were in favor. Democrats were especially opposed to military intervention.113 President Obama changed his mind and ultimately allowed Russian president Vladimir Putin to negotiate Syria’s surrender of its chemical weapons.

[.my2]
在某些情况下，总统似乎会在采取行动或做出决定前直接考虑公众舆论。2013 年， 奥巴马总统宣布，他正在考虑对叙利亚进行军事打击，以回应叙利亚政府非法对其公民使用沙林毒气的行为。尽管公众普遍认为对大马士革郊区的化学武器袭击是战争罪行，但他们反对美国介入 。48 %的受访者表示反对空袭，只有 29%的人表示支持。民主党人尤其反对军事干预。最终，奥巴马总统改变了主意，允许俄罗斯总统普京与叙利亚谈判，促使其交出化学武器。

However, further examples show that presidents do not consistently listen to public opinion. After taking office in 2009, President Obama did not order the closing of Guantanamo Bay prison, even though his proposal to do so had garnered support during the 2008 election. President Bush, despite growing public disapproval for the war in Iraq, did not end military support in Iraq after 2006. And President Bill Clinton, whose White House pollsters were infamous for polling on everything, sometimes ignored the public if circumstances warranted.114 In 1995, despite public opposition, Clinton guaranteed loans for the Mexican government to help the country out of financial insolvency. He followed this decision with many speeches to help the American public understand the importance of stabilizing Mexico’s economy. Individual examples like these make it difficult to persuasively identify the direct effects of public opinion on the presidency.

[.my2]
然而，更多例子表明，总统并非总是听取民意。奥巴马总统 2009 年就职后，并未下令关闭关塔那摩监狱，尽管他在 2008 年大选期间提出的关闭监狱的提议获得了支持。 布什总统尽管公众对伊拉克战争的反对声浪日益高涨，但在 2006 年后仍未停止对伊拉克的军事支持。而克林顿总统，其白宫民调机构以事事都要进行民调而臭名昭著，有时也会在必要时无视公众意见。 1995 年，尽管遭到公众反对，克林顿仍为墨西哥政府提供贷款担保，以帮助该国摆脱财政困境。此后，他发表了多次演讲，帮助美国公众理解稳定墨西哥经济的重要性。诸如此类的个案使得我们难以令人信服地证明民意对总统职位的直接影响。

While presidents have at most only two terms to serve and work, members of Congress can serve as long as the public returns them to office. We might think that for this reason public opinion is important to representatives and senators, and that their behavior, such as their votes on domestic programs or funding, will change to match the expectation of the public. In a more liberal time, the public may expect to see more social programs. In a non-liberal time, the public mood may favor austerity, or decreased government spending on programs. Failure to recognize shifts in public opinion may lead to a politician’s losing the next election.115
总统最多只能连任两届，而国会议员只要获得公众支持就可以一直任职。因此，我们或许会认为，公众舆论对众议员和参议员至关重要，他们的行为，例如对国内项目或拨款的投票，会根据公众的期望而改变。在较为自由的时期，公众可能期望看到更多的社会福利项目。而在较为保守的时期，公众情绪可能倾向于紧缩政策，即减少政府在各项项目上的支出。未能及时察觉公众舆论的变化可能会导致政治人物在下次选举中落败 。115

House of Representatives members, with a two-year term, have a more difficult time recovering from decisions that anger local voters. And because most representatives continually fundraise, unpopular decisions can hurt their campaign donations. For these reasons, it seems representatives should be susceptible to polling pressure. Yet one study, by James Stimson, found that the public mood does not directly affect elections, and shifts in public opinion do not predict whether a House member will win or lose. These elections are affected by the president on the ticket, presidential popularity (or lack thereof) during a midterm election, and the perks of incumbency, such as name recognition and media coverage. In fact, a later study confirmed that the incumbency effect is highly predictive of a win, and public opinion is not.116 In spite of this, we still see policy shifts in Congress, often matching the policy preferences of the public. When the shifts happen within the House, they are measured by the way members vote. The study’s authors hypothesize that House members alter their votes to match the public mood, perhaps in an effort to strengthen their electoral chances.117
众议院议员任期两年，因此更难从激怒当地选民的决策中恢复过来。而且由于大多数众议员需要持续筹款，不受欢迎的决策可能会影响他们的竞选捐款。基于这些原因，众议员似乎应该容易受到民调的影响。然而，詹姆斯·史汀生的一项研究发现，公众情绪并不会直接影响选举结果，民意的变化也无法预测众议员的胜负。这些选举受到总统候选人、总统在中期选举中的支持率（或支持率低迷）以及现任优势（例如知名度和媒体曝光度）的影响。事实上，后来的一项研究证实，现任优势对胜选具有很强的预测作用，而民意则不然。尽管如此，我们仍然看到国会的政策发生了变化，而且这些变化往往与公众的政策偏好相符。当这些变化发生在众议院内部时，其衡量标准是议员的投票方式。该研究的作者假设，众议院议员会根据公众情绪调整投票，这或许是为了提高他们的选举胜算 。117

The Senate is quite different from the House. Senators do not enjoy the same benefits of incumbency, and they win reelection at lower rates than House members. Yet, they do have one advantage over their colleagues in the House: Senators hold six-year terms, which gives them time to engage in fence-mending to repair the damage from unpopular decisions. In the Senate, Stimson’s study confirmed that opinion affects a senator’s chances at reelection, even though it did not affect House members. Specifically, the study shows that when public opinion shifts, fewer senators win reelection. Thus, when the public as a whole becomes more or less liberal, new senators are elected. Rather than the senators shifting their policy preferences and voting differently, it is the new senators who change the policy direction of the Senate.118
参议院与众议院截然不同。参议员不享有现任优势，连任率也低于众议员。然而，他们比众议院的同僚拥有一个优势：参议员任期六年，这使他们有时间弥合分歧，弥补不受欢迎的决策造成的损害。在参议院，史汀生的研究证实，民意会影响参议员的连任机会，尽管它对众议员没有影响。具体而言，该研究表明，当公众舆论发生转变时，连任的参议员人数会减少。因此，当公众整体变得更加自由或更加保守时，就会有新的参议员当选。与其说是参议员改变了他们的政策偏好和投票方式，不如说是新当选的参议员改变了参议院的政策方向 。118

Beyond voter polls, congressional representatives are also very interested in polls that reveal the wishes of interest groups and businesses. If AARP, one of the largest and most active groups of voters in the United States, is unhappy with a bill, members of the relevant congressional committees will take that response into consideration. If the pharmaceutical or oil industry is unhappy with a new patent or tax policy, its members’ opinions will have some effect on representatives’ decisions, since these industries contribute heavily to election campaigns.

除了选民民调之外，国会议员们也十分关注那些反映利益集团和企业意愿的民调。例如，如果美国退休人员协会（AARP ，美国规模最大、最活跃的选民团体之一）对某项法案不满，相关国会委员会的成员就会将此反馈纳入考量。如果制药或石油行业对一项新的专利或税收政策不满，其成员的意见也会对议员们的决策产生一定影响，因为这些行业在选举活动中投入了大量资金。

There is some disagreement about whether the Supreme Court follows public opinion or shapes it. The lifetime tenure the justices enjoy was designed to remove everyday politics from their decisions, protect them from swings in political partisanship, and allow them to choose whether and when to listen to public opinion. More often than not, the public is unaware of the Supreme Court’s decisions and opinions. When the justices accept controversial cases, the media tune in and ask questions, raising public awareness and affecting opinion. But do the justices pay attention to the polls when they make decisions?
关于最高法院是顺应民意还是塑造民意，一直存在一些争议。大法官们享有终身任期，其设立的初衷是为了使他们的判决不受日常政治的影响，避免受到党派政治摇摆的影响，并允许他们自主选择是否以及何时听取民意。通常情况下，公众并不了解最高法院的判决和意见。当大法官们受理一些争议性案件时，媒体会密切关注并提出问题，从而提高公众意识并影响舆论。但是，大法官们在做出判决时会考虑民意调查结果吗？

Studies that look at the connection between the Supreme Court and public opinion are contradictory. Early on, it was believed that justices were like other citizens: individuals with attitudes and beliefs who would be affected by political shifts.119 Later studies argued that Supreme Court justices rule in ways that maintain support for the institution. Instead of looking at the short term and making decisions day to day, justices are strategic in their planning and make decisions for the long term.120
研究最高法院与公众舆论之间关系的结论相互矛盾。早期，人们认为大法官和其他公民一样：他们拥有自己的态度和信仰，会受到政治变迁的影响。 119 后来的研究则认为，最高法院大法官的判决方式旨在维护公众对最高法院的支持。大法官们并非着眼于短期利益，而是进行战略规划，做出长远决策。 120

Other studies have revealed a more complex relationship between public opinion and judicial decisions, largely due to the difficulty of measuring where the effect can be seen. Some studies look at the number of reversals taken by the Supreme Court, which are decisions with which the Court overturns the decision of a lower court. In one study, the authors found that public opinion slightly affects cases accepted by the justices.121 In a study looking at how often the justices voted liberally on a decision, a stronger effect of public opinion was revealed.122
其他研究揭示了公众舆论与司法判决之间更为复杂的关系，这主要是由于难以衡量这种影响的具体体现。一些研究考察了最高法院推翻下级法院判决的次数。在一项研究中，作者发现公众舆论对大法官受理的案件有轻微影响。 121 而在另一项考察大法官在判决中投自由派票频率的研究中，公众舆论的影响更为显著。 122

Whether the case or court is currently in the news may also matter. A study found that if the majority of Americans agree on a policy or issue before the court, the court’s decision is likely to agree with public opinion.123 A second study determined that public opinion is more likely to affect ignored cases than heavily reported ones.124 In these situations, the court was also more likely to rule with the majority opinion than against it. For example, in Town of Greece v. Galloway (2014), a majority of the justices decided that ceremonial prayer before a town meeting was not a violation of the Establishment Clause.125 The fact that 78 percent of U.S. adults recently said religion is fairly to very important to their lives126 and 61 percent supported prayer in school127 may explain why public support for the Supreme Court did not fall after this decision.128
案件或法院是否受到媒体关注也可能产生影响。一项研究发现，如果大多数美国人对法院审理的政策或议题持有共识，那么法院的判决很可能与公众舆论相符。 123 另一项研究则表明，公众舆论对那些被忽视的案件的影响可能大于那些被广泛报道的案件。 124 在这些情况下，法院也更有可能采纳多数意见而非反对多数意见。例如，在 “希腊镇诉加洛韦案” （2014 年）中，多数大法官裁定，在镇民大会前进行祈祷仪式并不违反政教分离条款。 125 近期有 78%的美国成年人表示宗教对他们的生活相当重要或非常重要， 126 61%的人支持在学校进行祈祷， 127 这或许可以解释为什么最高法院的支持率在这一裁决后并未下降。 128

Overall, however, it is clear that public opinion has a less powerful effect on the courts than on the other branches and on politicians.129 Perhaps this is due to the lack of elections or justices’ lifetime tenure, or perhaps we have not determined the best way to measure the effects of public opinion on the Court.

然而，总体而言，很明显，公众舆论对法院的影响远小于对其他部门和政治人物的影响。 129 这或许是因为法院缺乏选举或法官终身任职制度，又或许是我们尚未找到衡量公众舆论对法院影响的最佳方法。
