== 释义





In practice, public policy consists of specific programs that provide resources to members of society, create regulations that protect U.S. citizens, and attempt to equitably fund the government. We can broadly categorize most policies based on their goals or the sector of society they affect, although many, such as food stamps, serve multiple purposes. Implementing these policies costs hundreds of billions of dollars each year, and understanding the goals of this spending and where the money goes is of vital importance to citizens and students of politics alike.

实际上，公共政策包含一系列具体项目，旨在为社会成员提供资源、制定保护美国公民的法规，并力求公平地为政府提供资金。我们可以根据政策的目标或所影响的社会群体对大多数政策进行大致分类，尽管许多政策，例如食品券，都具有多种用途。实施这些政策每年耗资数千亿美元，因此，了解这些支出的目标以及资金的去向对于公民和政治学研究者都至关重要。

SOCIAL WELFARE POLICY  社会福利政策
The U.S. government began developing a social welfare policy during the Great Depression of the 1930s. By the 1960s, social welfare had become a major function of the federal government—one to which most public policy funds are devoted—and had developed to serve several overlapping functions. First, social welfare policy is designed to ensure some level of equity in a democratic political system based on competitive, free-market economics. During the Great Depression, many politicians came to fear that the high unemployment and low-income levels plaguing society could threaten the stability of democracy, as was happening in European countries like Germany and Italy. The assumption in this thinking is that democratic systems work best when poverty is minimized. In societies operating in survival mode, in contrast, people tend to focus more on short-term problem-solving than on long-term planning. Second, social welfare policy creates an automatic stimulus for a society by building a safety net that can catch members of society who are suffering economic hardship through no fault of their own. For an individual family, this safety net makes the difference between eating and starving; for an entire economy, it could prevent an economic recession from sliding into a broader and more damaging depression.

美国政府在 20 世纪 30 年代的大萧条时期开始制定社会福利政策。到了 20 世纪 60 年代，社会福利已成为联邦政府的一项重要职能——大部分公共政策资金都用于此——并且发展成为一项具有多重重叠功能的职能。首先， 社会福利政策旨在确保基于竞争性自由市场经济的民主政治体系中存在一定程度的公平。在大萧条时期，许多政治家开始担心，困扰社会的失业率高企和低收入水平可能会威胁到民主的稳定，正如德国和意大利等欧洲国家的情况一样。这种想法的假设是，当贫困最小化时，民主制度才能发挥最佳作用。相比之下，在以生存为导向的社会中，人们往往更关注短期问题的解决方案，而不是长期规划。其次，社会福利政策通过建立一张安全网 ，为那些非因自身过错而遭受经济困境的社会成员提供援助，从而自动刺激社会发展。对于单个家庭而言，这张安全网决定着他们能否吃饱穿暖；对于整个经济体而言，它可以防止经济衰退滑向范围更广、破坏性更大的萧条。

One of the oldest and largest pieces of social welfare policy is Social Security, which cost the United States about $845 billion in 2014 alone.12 These costs are offset by a 12.4 percent payroll tax on all wages up to $118,500; employers and workers who are not self-employed split the bill for each worker, whereas the self-employed pay their entire share.13 Social Security was conceived as a solution to several problems inherent to the Industrial Era economy. First, by the 1920s and 1930s, an increasing number of workers were earning their living through manual or day-wage labor that depended on their ability to engage in physical activity (Figure 16.8). As their bodies weakened with age or if they were injured, their ability to provide for themselves and their families was compromised. Second, and of particular concern, were urban widows. During their working years, most American women stayed home to raise children and maintain the household while their husbands provided income. Should their husbands die or become injured, these women had no wage-earning skills with which to support themselves or their families.

[.my2]
社会保障是历史最悠久、规模最大的社会福利政策之一，仅 2014 年就耗资美国约 8450 亿美元。 12 这些支出通过对所有年薪不超过 11​​8,500 美元的工资征收 12.4%的工资税来抵消；雇主和非自雇人士共同承担每位员工的税款，而自雇人士则需全额缴纳。 13 社会保障制度的设立旨在解决工业时代经济中固有的几个问题。首先，到了 20 世纪 20 年代和 30 年代，越来越多的劳动者依靠体力劳动或日薪工作谋生，而这些工作依赖于他们的体力活动能力（ 图 16.8 ）。随着年龄增长，他们的身体机能下降，或者一旦受伤，他们养活自己和家人的能力就会受到影响。其次，尤其令人担忧的是城市寡妇。在她们的职业生涯中，大多数美国女性留在家中抚养子女、操持家务，而她们的丈夫则负责挣钱养家。如果她们的丈夫去世或受伤，这些妇女没有任何谋生技能来养活自己或家人。

Social Security addresses these concerns with three important tools. First and best known is the retirement benefit. After completing a minimum number of years of work, American workers may claim a form of pension upon reaching retirement age. It is often called an entitlement program since it guarantees benefits to a particular group, and virtually everyone will eventually qualify for the plan given the relatively low requirements for enrollment. The amount of money a worker receives is based loosely on that worker's lifetime earnings. Full retirement age was originally set at sixty-five, although changes in legislation have increased it to sixty-seven for workers born after 1959.14 A valuable added benefit is that, under certain circumstances, this income may also be claimed by the survivors of qualifying workers, such as spouses and minor children, even if they themselves did not have a wage income.

[.my2]
社会保障通过三项重要工具来解决这些问题。首先也是最广为人知的是退休福利。美国工人工作满一定年限后，达到退休年龄即可领取养老金。由于该计划保障特定群体的福利，且参保门槛相对较低，几乎每个人最终都能符合资格，因此通常被称为福利项目。工人领取的金额大致基于其终身收入。完全退休年龄最初设定为 65 岁，但立法变更后，1959 年以后出生的工人的完全退休年龄提高至 67 岁。一项重要的附加福利是，在某些情况下，符合条件的工人的遗属，例如配偶和未成年子女，即使他们本人没有工资收入，也可以领取这笔收入。

A second Social Security benefit is a disability payout, which the government distributes to workers who become unable to work due to disability. To qualify, workers must demonstrate that the injury or incapacitation will last at least twelve months. A third and final benefit is Supplemental Security Income, which provides supplemental income to adults or children with considerable disability or to the elderly who fall below an income threshold.

[.my2]
第二项社会保障福利是伤残津贴，政府会将其发放给因伤残而无法工作的劳动者。要符合领取资格，劳动者必须证明伤残或丧失劳动能力的情况将持续至少十二个月。第三项也是最后一项福利是补充保障收入，它为重度残疾的成年人或儿童，以及收入低于一定门槛的老年人提供补充收入。

During the George W. Bush administration, Social Security became a highly politicized topic as the Republican Party sought to find a way of preventing what experts predicted would be the impending collapse of the Social Security system (Figure 16.9). In 1950, the ratio of workers paying into the program to beneficiaries receiving payments was 16.5 to 1. In 2020, that number stood at 2.8 to 1, and is expected to fall to 2.3 to 1 by 2035.15 Most predictions in fact suggest that, due to continuing demographic changes including slower population growth and an aging population, by 2033, the amount of revenue generated from payroll taxes will no longer be sufficient to cover costs. The Bush administration proposed avoiding this by privatizing the program, in effect, taking it out of the government’s hands and making individuals’ benefits variable instead of defined. The effort ultimately failed, and Social Security’s long-term viability continues to remain uncertain. Numerous other plans for saving the program have been proposed, including raising the retirement age, increasing payroll taxes (especially on the wealthy) by removing the income cap ($142,800 in 2021), and reducing payouts for wealthier retirees.16 None of these proposals have been able to gain traction, however.

[.my2]
在乔治·W· 布什执政期间，社会保障成为一个高度政治化的话题，因为共和党试图找到一种方法来阻止专家预测的社会保障体系即将崩溃（ 图 16.9 ）。1950 年，缴纳社保的工人与领取社保金的受益人的比例为 16.5 比 1。到 2020 年，这一比例为 2.8 比 1，预计到 2035 年将降至 2.3 比 1。事实上，大多数预测表明，由于人口增长放缓和人口老龄化等持续的人口结构变化，到 2033 年，工资税收入将不足以支付社保支出。布什政府提议通过将社保私有化来避免这种情况，实际上是将社保从政府手中夺走，并将个人福利从固定金额改为浮动金额。但这一努力最终失败了，社会保障的长期生存能力仍然充满不确定性。为了挽救该计划，人们提出了许多其他方案，包括提高退休年龄、取消收入上限（2021 年为 142,800 美元 ）来增加工资税（尤其是针对富人的工资税），以及减少富裕退休人员的养老金。然而，这些方案均未能获得支持。

While Social Security was designed to provide cash payments to sustain elderly people and some people with disabilities, Medicare and Medicaid were intended to ensure that vulnerable populations have access to health care. Medicare, like Social Security, is an entitlement program funded through payroll taxes. Its purpose is to make sure that senior citizens and retirees have access to low-cost health care they might not otherwise have, because most U.S. citizens get their health insurance through their employers. Medicare provides three major forms of coverage: a guaranteed insurance benefit that helps cover major hospitalization, fee-based supplemental coverage that retirees can use to lower costs for doctor visits and other health expenses, and a prescription drug benefit. Medicare faces many of the same long-term challenges as Social Security, due to the same demographic shifts. Medicare also faces the problem that health care costs are rising significantly faster than inflation. In 2019, Medicare cost the federal government approximately $796 billion.17 , 18
社会保障旨在为老年人和部分残疾人士提供现金补贴，而联邦医疗保险（Medicare）和医疗补助（Medicaid）则旨在确保弱势群体获得医疗保健服务。与社会保障一样， 联邦医疗保险也是一项福利计划，资金来源于工资税。其目的是确保老年人和退休人员能够获得低成本的医疗保健服务，否则他们可能无法获得这些服务，因为大多数美国公民的医疗保险都是通过雇主获得的。联邦医疗保险提供三种主要的保障形式：一项保障性保险福利，用于支付重大住院费用；一项收费的补充保险，退休人员可以利用这项保险来降低就医和其他医疗支出；以及一项处方药福利。由于人口结构的变化，联邦医疗保险面临着与社会保障类似的诸多长期挑战。此外，联邦医疗保险还面临着医疗保健成本增长速度远超通货膨胀率的问题。2019 年，联邦医疗保险耗费了联邦政府约 7960 亿美元。 17 , 18

Medicaid is a formula-based, health insurance program, which means beneficiaries must demonstrate they fall within a particular income category. Individuals in the Medicaid program receive a fairly comprehensive set of health benefits, although access to health care may be limited because fewer providers accept payments from the program (it pays them less for services than does Medicare). Medicaid differs dramatically from Medicare in that it is partially funded by states, many of which have reduced access to the program by setting the income threshold so low that few people qualify. The ACA (2010) sought to change that by providing more federal money to the states if they agreed to raise minimum income requirements. Twelve states have refused, which has helped to keep the overall costs of Medicaid lower, even though it has also left many people without health coverage they might receive if they lived elsewhere. Total costs for Medicaid in 2020 were about $627 billion, about $405 billion of which was paid by the federal government.19
医疗补助计划 （Medicaid） 是一项基于公式计算的医疗保险计划，这意味着受益人必须证明其收入符合特定标准。参加医疗补助计划的个人可以获得相当全面的医疗福利，但由于接受该计划付款的医疗服务提供者较少（该计划支付的服务费用低于联邦医疗保险 Medicare），因此获得医疗服务的机会可能有限。医疗补助计划与联邦医疗保险 Medicare 的一个显著区别在于，它部分资金来自各州，而许多州通过将收入门槛设定得过低，导致符合资格的人寥寥无几，从而限制了该计划的覆盖范围。《平价医疗法案》（ACA，2010 年）试图改变这种状况，如果各州同意提高最低收入要求，联邦政府将向各州提供更多资金。有 12 个州拒绝了这一提议，这有助于降低医疗补助计划的总体成本，但也导致许多人失去了在其他地方可能获得的医疗保险。 2020 年，医疗补助计划的总成本约为 6270 亿美元，其中约 4050 亿美元由联邦政府支付。

Collectively, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid make up the lion’s share of total federal government spending, almost 48 percent in 2019. Several other smaller programs also provide income support to families. Most of these are formula-based, or means-tested, requiring citizens to meet certain maximum income requirements in order to qualify. A few examples are TANF, SNAP (also called food stamps), the unemployment insurance program, and various housing assistance programs. Collectively, these programs add up to a little over $361 billion.20
社会保障、医疗保险和医疗补助合计占联邦政府总支出的绝大部分，2019 年接近 48%。此外，还有一些规模较小的项目也为家庭提供收入支持。这些项目大多采用公式计算或收入调查的方式，要求公民达到一定的最高收入标准才能获得资格。例如，临时援助贫困家庭计划 (TANF)、补充营养援助计划 (SNAP，也称食品券)、失业保险计划以及各种住房援助计划。这些项目的总支出略高于 3610 亿美元。

SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND EDUCATION
科学、技术和教育
After World War II ended, the United States quickly realized that it had to address two problems to secure its fiscal and national security future. The first was that more than ten million servicemen and women needed to be reintegrated into the workforce, and many lacked appreciable work skills. The second problem was that the United States’ success in its new conflict with the Soviet Union depended on the rapid development of a new, highly technical military-industrial complex. To confront these challenges, the U.S. government passed several important pieces of legislation to provide education assistance to workers and research dollars to industry. As the needs of American workers and industry have changed, many of these programs have evolved from their original purposes, but they still remain important pieces of the public policy debate.

二战结束后，美国很快意识到，为了确保财政和国家安全，必须解决两大难题。首先，超过一千万退伍军人需要重新融入劳动力市场，而许多人缺乏必要的技能。其次，美国在与苏联的新冲突中能否取得胜利，取决于能否迅速发展一个全新的、高科技的军工复合体。为了应对这些挑战，美国政府通过了一系列重要法案，为工人提供教育援助，并为工业研发提供资金。随着美国工人和工业的需求不断变化，许多此类项目已偏离了最初的目标，但它们仍然是公共政策辩论的重要组成部分。

Much of the nation’s science and technology policy benefits its military, for instance, in the form of research and development funding for a range of defense projects. The federal government still promotes research for civilian uses, mostly through the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Recent debate over these agencies has focused on whether government funding is necessary or if private entities would be better suited. For example, although NASA continues to develop a replacement for the now-defunct U.S. space shuttle program (Figure 16.10), much of its workload is currently being performed by private companies working to develop their own space launch, resupply, and tourism programs.

国家的大部分科技政策都惠及军方，例如，通过为一系列国防项目提供研发资金。联邦政府仍然致力于推动民用领域的研究，主要通过国家科学基金会、国家卫生研究院、国家航空航天局（NASA）和国家海洋和大气管理局等机构开展。近期围绕这些机构的争论主要集中在政府资助是否必要，或者私营实体是否更合适。例如，尽管 NASA 仍在研发替代已停运的美国航天飞机项目的方案（ 图 16.10 ），但其大部分工作目前都由致力于开发自身太空发射、补给和旅游项目的私营公司承担。

The problem of trying to direct and fund the education of a modern U.S. workforce is familiar to many students of American government. Educational systems exist to carry out two distinct and lofty goals. First, they educate and provide opportunity to a learned society of individuals who can together govern society and run communities. Second, our educational institutions provide practical training for students to make a living. Therefore, governments and communities must simultaneously educate young people to be creative and responsible citizens while also providing practical job training programs for the workforces that communities, states, and the country need.

如何指导和资助现代美国劳动力的教育，对于许多研究美国政治的学生来说并不陌生。教育体系的存在是为了实现两个截然不同却又崇高的目标。首先，教育体系旨在培养知识渊博、能够共同治理社会和社区的公民，并为他们提供发展机会。其次，教育机构为学生提供谋生所需的实用技能培训。因此，政府和社区必须同时兼顾两方面：一方面，培养具有创造力和责任感的青年公民；另一方面，为社区、州和国家所需的劳动力提供实用的职业培训项目。

Historically, education has largely been the job of the states. While they have provided a very robust K–12 public education system, the national government has never moved to create an equivalent system of national higher education academies or universities as many other countries have done. As the need to keep the nation competitive with others became more pressing, however, the U.S. government did step in to direct its education dollars toward creating greater equity and ease of access to the existing public and private systems.

[.my2]
历史上， 教育主要由各州负责。尽管各州建立了非常完善的 K-12 公立教育体系，但联邦政府从未像许多其他国家那样，着手建立类似的全国性高等教育机构或大学体系。然而，随着保持国家竞争力的需求日益迫切，美国政府开始介入，将教育经费用于提升现有公立和私立教育体系的公平性和入学便利性。

The overwhelming portion of the federal government’s higher education money is spent on student loans, grants, and work-study programs. Resources are set aside to cover job-retraining programs for individuals who lack private-sector skills or who need to be retrained to meet changes in the economy’s demands for the labor force. National policy toward elementary and secondary education programs has typically focused on increasing resources available to school districts for nontraditional programs (such as preschool and special needs), or helping poorer schools stay competitive with wealthier institutions.

[.my2]
联邦政府高等教育经费的绝大部分用于学生贷款、助学金和勤工俭学项目。此外，还拨出专项资金用于职业再培训项目，帮助那些缺乏私营部门技能或需要接受再培训以适应经济劳动力需求变化的人员。国家对中小学教育项目的政策通常侧重于增加学区用于非传统项目（例如学前教育和特殊教育）的资源，或帮助较贫困的学校与较富裕的学校保持竞争力。

BUSINESS STIMULUS AND REGULATION
商业刺激与监管
A final key aspect of domestic policy is the growth and regulation of business. The size and strength of the economy is very important to politicians whose jobs depend on citizens’ believing in their own future prosperity. At the same time, people in the United States want to live in a world where they feel safe from unfair or environmentally damaging business practices. These desires have forced the government to perform a delicate balancing act between programs that help grow the economy by providing benefits to the business sector and those that protect consumers, often by curtailing or regulating the business sector.

[.my2]
国内政策的最后一个关键方面是企业的增长和监管。经济规模和实力对政客至关重要，因为他们的执政取决于民众对未来繁荣的信心。与此同时，美国民众希望生活在一个免受不公平或破坏环境的商业行为侵害的世界里。这些诉求迫使政府在促进经济增长（通过向企业提供优惠政策）和保护消费者（通常通过限制或监管企业）之间寻求微妙的平衡。

Two of the largest recipients of government aid to business are agriculture and energy. Both are multi-billion dollar industries concentrated in rural and/or electorally influential states. Because voters are affected by the health of these sectors every time they pay their grocery or utility bill, the U.S. government has chosen to provide significant agriculture and energy subsidies to cover the risks inherent in the unpredictability of the weather and oil exploration. Government subsidies also protect these industries’ profitability. These two purposes have even overlapped in the government’s controversial decision to subsidize the production of ethanol, a fuel source similar to gasoline but generated from corn.

[.my2]
农业和能源是政府对企业援助的两大受益者。这两个行业都是价值数十亿美元的产业，集中在农村地区和/或具有选举影响力的州。由于选民每次支付食品杂货或水电费时都会受到这些行业健康状况的影响，美国政府选择提供大量的农业和能源补贴，以应对天气和石油勘探等不可预测因素带来的风险。政府补贴也保障了这些行业的盈利能力。在政府颇具争议的补贴乙醇生产（一种类似于汽油但由玉米制成的燃料）的决定中，这两个目的甚至有所重叠。

When it comes to regulation, the federal government has created several agencies responsible for providing for everything from worker safety (OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration), to food safety (FDA), to consumer protection, where the recently created Bureau of Consumer Protection ensures that businesses do not mislead consumers with deceptive or manipulative practices. Another prominent federal agency, the EPA, is charged with ensuring that businesses do not excessively pollute the nation’s air or waterways. A complex array of additional regulatory agencies governs specific industries such as banking and finance, which are detailed later in this chapter.

[.my2]
在监管方面，联邦政府设立了多个机构，负责从工人安全（职业安全与健康管理局，OSHA）到食品安全（食品药品监督管理局，FDA）再到消费者保护等各个方面的工作。其中，新成立的消费者保护局负责确保企业不会以欺骗或操纵手段误导消费者。另一个重要的联邦机构——环境保护署（EPA）——则负责确保企业不会过度污染国家的空气和水道。此外，还有一系列复杂的监管机构负责监管银行和金融等特定行业，本章稍后将详细介绍这些机构。
