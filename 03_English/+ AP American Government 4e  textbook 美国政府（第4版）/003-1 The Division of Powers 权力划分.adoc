== 释义



Modern democracies divide governmental power in two general ways; some, like the United States, use a combination of both structures. The first and more common mechanism shares power among three branches of government—the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. The second, federalism, apportions power between two levels of government: national and subnational. In the United States, the term federal government refers to the government at the national level, while the term states means governments at the subnational level.

**现代民主国家, 划分"政府权力"的方式, 主要有两种；有些国家，例如美国，则结合了这两种结构。第一种也是更常见的机制，是"将权力分配给政府的三个分支"——立法、行政和司法部门。第二种机制，即联邦制，是将权力分配给两个层级的政府：国家级和地方级。**在美国， “联邦政府” 一词指的是国家层面的政府，而 “州” 一词则指的是地方层面的政府。

=== FEDERALISM DEFINED AND CONTRASTED

[.my2]
联邦制的定义与对比

Federalism is an institutional arrangement that creates two relatively autonomous levels of government, each possessing the capacity to act directly on behalf of the people with the authority granted to it by the national constitution.1 Although today’s federal systems vary in design, five structural characteristics are common to the United States and other federal systems around the world, including Germany and Mexico.

[.my2]
**联邦制是一种制度安排，它创建了两个"相对自治"的政府层级，每个层级都拥有代表人民直接行事的能力，**其权力由国家宪法赋予。尽管当今的联邦制在设计上有所不同，但**美国以及包括德国和墨西哥在内的世界其他联邦制国家, 都具有五个共同的结构特征。**

First, all federal systems establish two levels of government, with both levels being elected by the people and each level assigned different functions. The national government is responsible for handling matters that affect the country as a whole, for example, defending the nation against foreign threats and promoting national economic prosperity. Subnational, or state governments, are responsible for matters that lie within their regions, which include ensuring the well-being of their people by administering education, health care, public safety, and other public services. By definition, a system like this requires that different levels of government cooperate, because the institutions at each level form an interacting network. In the U.S. federal system, all national matters are handled by the federal government, which is led by the president and members of Congress, all of whom are elected by voters across the country. All matters at the subnational level are the responsibility of the fifty states, each headed by an elected governor and legislature. Thus, there is a separation of functions between the federal and state governments, and voters choose the leader at each level.

[.my2]
**首先，所有联邦制国家, 都设立了两级政府，两级政府均由人民选举产生，且各自承担不同的职能。**联邦政府负责处理影响国家整体的事务，例如保卫国家免受外敌入侵, 和促进国家经济繁荣。州政府（或称地方政府）负责处理其辖区内的事务，包括通过提供教育、医疗保健、公共安全和其他公共服务,来保障人民福祉。根据定义，这样的体系, 要求不同层级的政府进行合作，因为各级机构构, 成了一个相互作用的网络。在美国联邦制国家中，所有国家事务均由联邦政府处理，联邦政府由总统和国会议员领导，他们都由全国选民选举产生。所有地方事务均由五十个州负责，每个州都由民选州长和州议会领导。 因此 ，*联邦政府和州政府的职能是分离的，各级领导人均由选民选举产生。*

The second characteristic common to all federal systems is a written national constitution that cannot be changed without the substantial consent of subnational governments. In the American federal system, the twenty-seven amendments added to the Constitution since its adoption were the result of an arduous process that required approval by two-thirds of both houses of Congress and three-fourths of the states. The main advantage of this supermajority requirement is that no changes to the Constitution can occur unless there is broad support within Congress and among states. The potential drawback is that numerous national amendment initiatives—such as the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which aims to guarantee equal rights regardless of sex—have failed because they cannot garner sufficient consent among members of Congress or, in the case of the ERA, the states. The ERA appeared to gain new life in 2020 as a thirty-eighth state (Virginia) formally voted to ratify the amendment. However, the amendment's original ratification deadline of 1982 had long since passed, and hence the amendment did not take effect. The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation in the 117th Congress (2021) to extend the deadline; however, a similar measure introduced in the Senate, while garnering 51 co-sponsors, did not pass.

[.my2]
所有联邦制国家的第二个共同特征, 是拥有一部成文的全国性宪法，##**未经地方政府的广泛同意，宪法不得修改。**##在美国联邦制国家，自宪法通过以来新增的 27 条修正案，都是经过漫长而艰辛的程序, 才得以通过的(想想中国, 领导人想改无限任期, 就一句话的事情就把中国宪法给改了)，**这些修正案需要国会两院三分之二的议员, 以及四分之三的州批准。**这种"绝对多数制要求"的主要优势在于，除非获得国会和各州的广泛支持，否则任何宪法修正案都无法生效。其潜在弊端在于，许多旨在"保障男女平等权利"的全国性修正案提案——例如《 平等权利修正案 》（ERA）——都因未能获得国会议员或各州（就 ERA 而言）的足够支持而失败。2020 年，随着弗吉尼亚州正式投票批准该修正案，ERA 似乎重获新生。然而，该修正案最初的批准期限——1982 年——早已过去，因此该修正案并未生效。美国众议院在第 117 届国会（2021 年）通过了延长截止日期的法案；然而，参议院提出的类似法案, 虽然获得了 51 位共同提案人的支持，但最终未能获得通过 。

Third, the constitutions of countries with federal systems formally allocate legislative, judicial, and executive authority to the two levels of government in such a way as to ensure each level some degree of autonomy from the other. Under the U.S. Constitution, the president assumes executive power, Congress exercises legislative powers, and the federal courts (e.g., U.S. district courts, appellate courts, and the Supreme Court) assume judicial powers. In each of the fifty states, a governor assumes executive authority, a state legislature makes laws, and state-level courts (e.g., trial courts, intermediate appellate courts, and supreme courts) possess judicial authority.

[.my2]
第三，实行"联邦制"的国家的宪法, 正式将立法权、司法权和行政权, 分配给"联邦"和"国会"两级政府，以确保各级政府在一定程度上享有自治权。根据美国宪法，总统行使"行政权"，国会行使"立法权"，联邦法院（例如，美国地方法院、上诉法院和最高法院）行使"司法权"。在五十个州中，州长行使行政权，"州议会"制定法律，州级法院（例如，初审法院、中级上诉法院, 和最高法院）行使司法权。

While each level of government is somewhat independent of the others, a great deal of interaction occurs among them. In fact, the ability of the federal and state governments to achieve their objectives often depends on the cooperation of the other level of government. For example, the federal government’s efforts to ensure homeland security are bolstered by the involvement of law enforcement agents working at local and state levels. On the other hand, the ability of states to provide their residents with public education and health care is enhanced by the federal government’s financial assistance.

[.my2]
虽然各级政府在一定程度上独立运作，但它们之间却存在着大量的互动。事实上，联邦政府和州政府实现其目标的能力, 往往取决于另一级政府的合作。例如，联邦政府为确保国土安全所做的努力，离不开地方和州级执法人员的参与。另一方面，联邦政府的财政援助, 也增强了各州为居民提供公共教育和医疗保健的能力。

Another common characteristic of federalism around the world is that national courts commonly resolve disputes between levels and departments of government. In the United States, conflicts between states and the federal government are adjudicated by federal courts, with the U.S. Supreme Court being the final arbiter. The resolution of such disputes can preserve the autonomy of one level of government, as illustrated recently when the Supreme Court ruled that states cannot interfere with the federal government’s actions relating to immigration. In other instances, a Supreme Court ruling can erode that autonomy, as demonstrated in the 1940s when, in United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co., the Court enabled the federal government to regulate commercial activities that occurred within states, a function previously handled exclusively by the states.

[.my2]
世界各国"联邦制"的另一个共同特征是，国家法院通常负责解决各级政府和部门之间的纠纷。*在美国，州政府与联邦政府之间的冲突, 由联邦法院裁决*，而"美国最高法院"则是最终裁决者。此类纠纷的解决, 可以维护某一级政府的自主权，例如，*最高法院最近裁定, 各州不得干预联邦政府在移民问题上的行动。*  但在其他情况下，最高法院的裁决, 也可能削弱这种自主权，例如在 20 世纪 40 年代的 “美国诉赖特伍德乳品公司案”中，最高法院授权联邦政府监管各州境内的商业活动，而这项职能此前一直由各州专属行使。

Finally, subnational governments are always represented in the upper house of the national legislature, enabling regional interests to influence national lawmaking. In the American federal system, the U.S. Senate functions as a territorial body by representing the fifty states: Each state elects two senators to ensure equal representation regardless of state population differences. Thus, federal laws are shaped in part by state interests, which senators convey to the federal policymaking process.

[.my2]
最后，*地方政府始终在国家立法机构的"上议院"中, 拥有席位，这使得区域利益能够影响国家立法。* 在美国联邦体制中，*美国"参议院"作为一个地域性机构，代表五十个州*：每个州选举两名参议员，以确保各州代表人数平等，不受州人口差异的影响。 因此 ，联邦法律在一定程度上, 受到各州利益的影响，而参议员则将这些利益, 传达给联邦决策过程。

The governmental design of the United States is unusual; most countries do not have a federal structure. Aside from the United States, how many other countries have a federal system?

[.my2]
美国的政府体制设计很特殊；大多数国家并非"联邦制"国家。除了美国之外， 还有多少其他国家实行联邦制？

Division of power can also occur via a unitary structure or confederation (Figure 3.2). In contrast to federalism, a unitary system makes subnational governments dependent on the national government, where significant authority is concentrated. Before the late 1990s, the United Kingdom’s unitary system was centralized to the extent that the national government held the most important levers of power. Since then, power has been gradually decentralized through a process of devolution, leading to the creation of regional governments in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland as well as the delegation of specific responsibilities to them. Other democratic countries with unitary systems, such as France, Japan, and Sweden, have followed a similar path of decentralization.

[.my2]
权力划分, 也可以通过"单一制结构"或"邦联制"来实现（ 图 3.2 ）。**与联邦制不同， "单一制"使地方政府依赖于中央政府，权力高度集中于中央政府。**在 20 世纪 **90 年代末之前，英国的单一制高度集权，**中央政府掌握着最重要的权力杠杆。**此后，权力通过权力下放逐步分散，**苏格兰、威尔士和北爱尔兰相继成立了地方政府，并被赋予了特定的职责。*其他实行单一制的民主国家，例如法国、日本和瑞典，也遵循了类似的权力下放路径。*

Figure 3.2 There are three general systems of government—unitary systems, federations, and confederations—each of which allocates power differently.

[.my2]
图 3.2 政府体制有三种类型——单一制、联邦制, 和邦联制——每种类型"分配权力"的方式都不同。


A flow chart depicts the three general systems of government: the unitary system, the federation, and the confederation. The unitary system flowchart starts with the National Government, which flows down to the States. Below the chart, it says, “Authority is concentrated in the central government. Examples: United Kingdom, Japan, Sweden.” The Federation flow chart starts with the People on top. The flow branches down and splits between two boxes; the states, and the National Government. Below this chart, it says, “Authority is divided between central and state governments and is derived from the people. Examples: Canada, India, United States under the Constitution”. The Confederation flow chart starts with the States on top, with an arrow flowing down to the National Government. Under this chart, it says “Authority is concentrated in states. Example: United States under the Articles of Confederation”.

[.my2]
一张流程图描绘了三种常见的政府体制：单一制、联邦制, 和邦联制。"单一制"流程图从国家政府开始，向下延伸到各州。图表下方标注：“权力集中在中央政府。例子：英国、日本、瑞典。” "*联邦制*"流程图顶部是人民。流程向下分支，分为两个方框：州政府和国家政府。该图表下方标注：“**权力在中央政府和州政府之间分配，**且源于人民。例子：加拿大、印度、实行宪法后的美国。” "#*邦联制*#"流程图顶部是各州，有一条箭头向下指向国家政府。该图表下方标注：“**#权力集中在各州。#**例子：实行《邦联条例》时期的美国。”

In a confederation, authority is decentralized, and the central government’s ability to act depends on the consent of the subnational governments. Under the Articles of Confederation (the first constitution of the United States), states were sovereign and powerful while the national government was subordinate and weak. Because states were reluctant to give up any of their power, the national government lacked authority in the face of challenges such as servicing the war debt, ending commercial disputes among states, negotiating trade agreements with other countries, and addressing popular uprisings that were sweeping the country. As the brief American experience with confederation clearly shows, the main drawback with this system of government is that it maximizes regional self-rule at the expense of effective national governance.

[.my2]
在"邦联制"中，权力分散，中央政府的行动能力, 取决于各地方政府的同意。根据 《邦联条例》 （美国第一部宪法），各州拥有主权和权力，而联邦政府则处于从属地位, 且权力薄弱。由于各州不愿放弃任何权力，联邦政府在面对诸如偿还战争债务、解决各州之间的商业纠纷、与其他国家谈判贸易协定, 以及应对席卷全国的民众起义等挑战时，缺乏权威。*正如美国短暂的"邦联制"经验所清楚表明的那样，这种政府体制的主要缺陷在于，它以牺牲有效的国家治理为代价，最大限度地赋予了地方自治权。*

=== FEDERALISM AND THE CONSTITUTION

[.my2]
联邦制与宪法


The Constitution contains several provisions that direct the functioning of U.S. federalism. Some delineate the scope of national and state power, while others restrict it. The remaining provisions shape relationships among the states and between the states and the federal government.

[.my2]
美国宪法包含若干条款，指导着美国联邦制的运作。其中一些条款界定了国家和州的权力范围，而另一些条款则限制了这些权力。其余条款则塑造了各州之间, 以及各州与联邦政府之间的关系。

The enumerated powers of the national legislature are found in Article I, Section 8. These powers define the jurisdictional boundaries within which the federal government has authority. In seeking not to replay the problems that plagued the young country under the Articles of Confederation, the Constitution’s framers granted Congress specific powers that ensured its authority over national and foreign affairs. To provide for the general welfare of the populace, it can tax, borrow money, regulate interstate and foreign commerce, and protect property rights, for example. To provide for the common defense of the people, the federal government can raise and support armies and declare war. Furthermore, national integration and unity are fostered with the government’s powers over the coining of money, naturalization, postal services, and other responsibilities.

[.my2]
国家立法机关的列举权力, 载于宪法第一条第八款。这些权力界定了联邦政府的管辖范围。为了避免重蹈覆辙，避免重蹈《邦联条例》时期困扰这个年轻国家的覆辙，宪法的制定者, 赋予国会特定的权力，以确保其对内政和外交事务的权威。例如，为了增进民众福祉，国会可以征税、借贷、监管州际和国际贸易，以及保护财产权。为了保卫人民，联邦政府可以组建和维持军队，并宣战。此外，政府在货币铸造、入籍、邮政服务和其他事务上的权力，也有助于促进国家一体化和团结。

The last clause of Article I, Section 8, commonly referred to as the elastic clause or the necessary and proper clause, enables Congress “to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying” out its constitutional responsibilities. While the enumerated powers define the policy areas in which the national government has authority, the elastic clause allows it to create the legal means to fulfill those responsibilities. However, the open-ended construction of this clause has enabled the national government to expand its authority beyond what is specified in the Constitution, a development also motivated by the expansive interpretation of the commerce clause, which empowers the federal government to regulate interstate economic transactions.

[.my2]
第一条第八款的最后一项，通常被称为"弹性条款"或"必要且适当条款" ，赋予国会“为履行”其宪法职责, 所必需和适当的一切法律的权力。**列举的权力, 界定了联邦政府的政策权限范围，而"弹性条款"则允许其制定履行这些职责所需的法律手段。然而，该条款的开放式解释, 使得联邦政府得以将其权力, 扩展到宪法规定的范围之外，**这一发展也受到商业条款的扩张性解释的推动， 该条款赋予联邦政府监管"州际经济交易"的权力。

The powers of the state governments were never listed in the original Constitution. The consensus among the framers was that states would retain any powers not prohibited by the Constitution or delegated to the national government.7 However, when it came time to ratify the Constitution, a number of states requested that an amendment be added explicitly identifying the reserved powers of the states. What these Anti-Federalists sought was further assurance that the national government’s capacity to act directly on behalf of the people would be restricted, which the first ten amendments (Bill of Rights) provided. The Tenth Amendment affirms the states’ reserved powers: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” Indeed, state constitutions had bills of rights, which the first Congress used as the source for the first ten amendments to the Constitution.

[.my2]
州政府的权力, 从未在最初的宪法中列出。制宪者的共识是，各州保留宪法未禁止或未授予联邦政府的任何权力。 然而 ，在批准宪法时，一些州要求增加一项修正案，明确列出各州保留的权力。这些反联邦主义者寻求的, 是进一步确保"联邦政府直接代表人民行事的能力"受到限制，而前十条修正案（ 权利法案 ）正提供了这种限制。 **第十修正案确认了各州保留的权力：“宪法未授予合众国，也未禁止各州行使的权力，均由各州或人民保留。”**事实上，各州宪法都包含"权利法案"，第一届国会正是以此为基础, 制定了宪法的前十条修正案。

Some of the states’ reserved powers are no longer exclusively within state domain, however. For example, since the 1940s, the federal government has also engaged in administering health, safety, income security, education, and welfare to state residents. The boundary between intrastate and interstate commerce has become indefinable as a result of broad interpretation of the commerce clause. Shared and overlapping powers have become an integral part of contemporary U.S. federalism. These concurrent powers range from taxing, borrowing, and making and enforcing laws to establishing court systems (Figure 3.3).

[.my2]
**然而，一些州保留的权力, 已不再完全属于州的管辖范围。例如，自 20 世纪 40 年代以来，联邦政府也参与了对州居民的健康、安全、收入保障、教育和福利的管理。**由于对商业条款的广泛解释，"州内贸易"和"州际贸易"之间的界限, 变得难以界定。**共享和重叠的权力, 已成为当代美国联邦制不可或缺的一部分。**这些并行权力涵盖了征税、借贷、制定和执行法律, 以及建立法院系统等诸多方面（ 图 3.3 ）。

[.my2]
图 3.3 显示了美国联邦政府和州政府之间的宪法权力和责任划分。这两个层级的政府,也共享并行权力。


This chart lists the powers of the federal government, the state government, and the concurrent powers they share. Under the Federal Government, the enumerated powers listed are coin money, regulate interstate and foreign commerce, conduct foreign affairs, establish rules of naturalization, punish counterfeiting, establish copyright/patent laws, regulate postal system, establish courts inferior to Supreme court, declare war, raise and support armies, make all laws “necessary and proper” to carry out responsibilities. The powers denied under the federal government are tax state exports, change state boundaries, and violate the Bill of Rights. Under the State Government, the reserved powers listed are regulate intrastate commerce, conduct elections, provide for public health, safety, welfare, and morals, establish local governments, maintain militia (National Guard), and ratify amendments to the constitution. Under powers denied, the chart lists tax imports and exports, coin money, enter into treaties, impair obligation of contracts, abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens or deny due process and equal protection of the laws. Under concurrent powers, the chart lists levy and collect taxes, borrow money, make and enforce laws, establish courts, charter banks and corporations, and take property for public purpose with just compensation (eminent domain).

[.my2]
这份图表列出了联邦政府的权力、州政府的权力, 以及它们共同拥有的"并存权力"。 ① 联邦政府（Federal Government） - 列举权力（Enumerated Powers）： 铸造货币、管理州际和对外贸易、处理外交事务、制定入籍规则、惩罚伪造行为、制定版权 / 专利法、管理邮政系统、设立低于最高法院的各级法院、宣战、招募和维持军队，以及**制定为履行职责所 “必需和适当” 的一切法律（即 “必要和适当条款”）。** - 被禁止的权力（Denied Powers）： 对州出口商品征税、变更州界、以及违反《权利法案》。② 州政府（State Government）- 保留权力（Reserved Powers）： 管理州内贸易、组织选举、提供公共卫生、安全、福利和道德规范、设立地方政府、**维持民兵（国民警卫队），**以及批准宪法修正案。 - **被禁止的权力（Denied Powers）： 对进出口商品征税、**铸造货币、**缔结条约、**损害契约义务、**剥夺公民的特权或豁免权，**或拒绝给予法律的正当程序和平等保护。③ 并存权力（Concurrent Powers） - 共同权力： 征收和收取税款、借款、制定和执行法律、设立法院、特许银行和公司，以及通过公正补偿"征用私有财产 供公共使用"（即 “征用权”）。


Article I, Sections 9 and 10, along with several constitutional amendments, lay out the restrictions on federal and state authority. The most important restriction Section 9 places on the national government prevents measures that cause the deprivation of personal liberty. Specifically, the government cannot suspend the writ of habeas corpus, which enables someone in custody to petition a judge to determine whether that person’s detention is legal; pass a bill of attainder, a legislative action declaring someone guilty without a trial; or enact an ex post facto law, which criminalizes an act retroactively. The Bill of Rights affirms and expands these constitutional restrictions, ensuring that the government cannot encroach on personal freedoms.

[.my2]
第一条第九款和第十款，以及若干宪法修正案，规定了对联邦和州权力的限制。第九款对联邦政府最重要的限制, 是防止其采取剥夺个人自由的措施。具体而言，*政府不得中止"人身保护令" （即允许被拘留者向法官申请裁定"其拘留是否合法"的令状）*；不得通过剥夺"公民权利法案" （即未经审判, 就宣布某人有罪的立法行为）；也不得制定"事后法"（即追溯既往地 将某种行为定为犯罪）。《权利法案》确认并扩展了这些宪法限制，确保政府不能侵犯个人自由。

The states are also constrained by the Constitution. Article I, Section 10, prohibits the states from entering into treaties with other countries, coining money, and levying taxes on imports and exports. Like the federal government, the states cannot violate personal freedoms by suspending the writ of habeas corpus, passing bills of attainder, or enacting ex post facto laws. Furthermore, the Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, prohibits the states from denying citizens the rights to which they are entitled by the Constitution, due process of law, or the equal protection of the laws. Lastly, three civil rights amendments—the Fifteenth, Nineteenth, and Twenty-Sixth—prevent both the states and the federal government from abridging citizens’ right to vote based on race, sex, and age. This topic remains controversial because states have not always ensured equal protection.

[.my2]
各州也受到宪法的约束。宪法第一条第十款, **禁止各州与其他国家缔结条约、**铸造货币, *以及对进出口商品征税*。与联邦政府一样，各州不得通过中止"人身保护令"、通过剥夺"公民权利法案", 或制定溯及既往的法律, 来侵犯公民的个人自由。此外，1868 年批准的第十四修正案, 禁止各州剥夺公民根据宪法享有的权利、正当法律程序, 或法律面前人人平等的权利。最后，三项民权修正案——第十五、第十九和第二十六修正案——禁止各州和联邦政府基于种族、性别和年龄, 限制公民的投票权。由于各州并非始终确保平等保护，因此这一话题仍然存在争议。

The supremacy clause in Article VI of the Constitution regulates relationships between the federal and state governments by declaring that the Constitution and federal law are the supreme law of the land. This means that if a state law clashes with a federal law found to be within the national government’s constitutional authority, the federal law prevails. The intent of the supremacy clause is not to subordinate the states to the federal government; rather, it affirms that one body of laws binds the country. In fact, all national and state government officials are bound by oath to uphold the Constitution regardless of the offices they hold. Yet enforcement is not always that simple. In the case of marijuana use, which the federal government defines to be illegal, thirty-six states and the District of Columbia have nevertheless established medical marijuana laws, others have decriminalized its recreational use, and fifteen states have completely legalized it. The federal government could act in this area if it wanted to. For example, in addition to the legalization issue, there is the question of how to treat the money from marijuana sales, which the national government designates as drug money and regulates under laws regarding its deposit in banks.

[.my2]
宪法第六条中的“最高条款”, 通过宣布宪法和联邦法律是国家的最高法律，来规范联邦政府和州政府之间的关系。这意味着，**如果"州法律"与"联邦法律"相冲突，且"联邦法律"被认定是在"联邦政府的宪法权限范围内"，则以联邦法律为准。**最高条款的意图, 并非使各州屈从于联邦政府，而是确认一套法律体系对全国具有约束力。事实上，所有联邦和州政府官员, 无论担任何种职务，都必须宣誓维护宪法。然而，执法并非总是如此简单。**以大麻为例，尽管联邦政府将其定义为非法，但仍有 36 个州和哥伦比亚特区, 制定了"医用大麻法"，其他一些州已将"娱乐性大麻"合法化，还有 15 个州已将其完全合法化。**如果联邦政府愿意，它完全可以在这一领域采取行动。例如，除了合法化问题之外，还有如何处理"大麻销售所得资金"的问题，国家政府将其认定为毒资，并根据法律,对其在银行的存款进行监管。

Various constitutional provisions govern state-to-state relations. Article IV, Section 1, referred to as the full faith and credit clause, requires the states to accept court decisions, public acts, and contracts of other states. Thus, an adoption certificate or driver’s license issued in one state is valid in any other state. The movement for marriage equality has put the full faith and credit clause to the test in recent decades. In light of Baehr v. Lewin, a 1993 ruling in which the Hawaii Supreme Court asserted that the state’s ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional, a number of states became worried that they would be required to recognize those marriage certificates.9 To address this concern, Congress passed and President Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 1996. The law declared that “No state (or other political subdivision within the United States) need recognize a marriage between persons of the same sex, even if the marriage was concluded or recognized in another state.” The law also barred federal benefits for same-sex partners.

[.my2]
各州之间的关系, 受多项宪法条款的约束。 第四条第一款，即所谓的**“ 完全信任与尊重条款” ，要求各州承认其他州的法院判决、公共法令, 以及合同。因此，在一个州签发的收养证明, 或驾驶执照, 在其他任何州都有效。**近几十年来，争取婚姻平等的运动, 对“完全信任与尊重条款”提出了考验。1993 年，夏威夷州最高法院在 “贝赫诉莱文案”（Baehr v. Lewin） 中, 裁定该州"禁止同性婚姻"的禁令违宪，此后，许多州开始担心自己会被要求承认这些婚姻证书。为了解决这一担忧，国会于 1996 年通过了《 婚姻保护法案 》（ DOMA ），并由克林顿总统签署生效。该法案宣布，“任何州（或美国境内的其他政治区划）都无需承认同性婚姻，即使该婚姻是在另一个州缔结或被承认的。”该法案还禁止同性伴侣享受联邦福利。

DOMA clearly made the topic a state matter. It denoted a choice for states, which led many states to take up the policy issue of marriage equality. Scores of states considered legislation and ballot initiatives on the question. The federal courts took up the issue with zeal after the U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Windsor struck down the part of DOMA that outlawed federal benefits. That move was followed by upwards of forty federal court decisions that upheld marriage equality in particular states. In 2014, the Supreme Court decided not to hear several key case appeals from a variety of states, all of which were brought by opponents of marriage equality who had lost in the federal courts. The outcome of not hearing these cases was that federal court decisions in four states were affirmed, which, when added to other states in the same federal circuit districts, brought the total number of states permitting same-sex marriage to thirty. Then, in 2015, the Obergefell v. Hodges case had a sweeping effect when the Supreme Court clearly identified a constitutional right to marriage based on the Fourteenth Amendment.

[.my2]
《婚姻保护法案》（DOMA）明确将婚姻平等问题, 交由各州自行决定。这意味着各州可以自行选择，这促使许多州开始关注婚姻平等的政策议题。数十个州就此问题考虑了立法和公投提案。在最高法院于“ 美国诉温莎案” 中推翻了 DOMA 中禁止联邦福利的条款后，联邦法院也积极介入了这一问题。  此后，联邦法院做出了四十多项裁决，支持特定州的婚姻平等。2014 年，最高法院决定不审理来自多个州的几起关键案件的上诉，这些上诉, 均由"在联邦法院败诉的婚姻平等反对者"提起。不审理这些案件的结果是，四个州的联邦法院判决, 得到维持，加上同一联邦巡回区内其他州的判决，允许同性婚姻的州总数达到 30 个。 随后，在 2015 年， 奥贝格费尔诉霍奇斯案, 产生了深远的影响，最高法院在该案中明确指出，婚姻是一项基于第十四修正案的宪法权利 。

The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, also called the comity clause, asserts that states are prohibited from discriminating against out-of-staters by denying them such guarantees as access to courts, legal protection, property rights, and travel rights. The clause has not been interpreted to mean there cannot be any difference in the way a state treats residents and non-residents. For example, individuals cannot vote in a state in which they do not reside, tuition at state universities is higher for out-of-state residents, and in some cases individuals who have recently become residents of a state must wait a certain amount of time to be eligible for social welfare benefits. Another constitutional provision prohibits states from establishing trade restrictions on goods produced in other states. However, a state can tax out-of-state goods sold within its borders as long as state-made goods are taxed at the same level.

第四条的特权和豁免条款 ，也称"礼让条款"，规定: 各州不得歧视外州居民，剥夺其诉诸法院、法律保护、财产权和旅行权等权利。*该条款并未被解释为"各州对待居民和非居民的方式, 绝对不能有任何差别"。例如，##个人不能在"居住地以外的州"投票，"州立大学"对"州外居民"的学费更高. 在某些情况下，新近成为某州居民的个人, 必须等待一段时间才能享受社会福利。##另一项宪法条款, 禁止各州对"其他州生产的商品"设置贸易限制。但是，只要对"本州生产的商品"征收同等税率，各州就可以对"在本州境内销售的外州商品"征税。* (本州对本州生产的商品征税是什么意思?)

=== THE DISTRIBUTION OF FINANCES

[.my2]
资金分配

Federal, state, and local governments depend on different sources of revenue to finance their annual expenditures. In 2021, total revenue (or receipts) reached $4.3 trillion for the federal government, $2.5 trillion for the states, and $1.6 trillion for local governments. Two important developments have fundamentally changed the allocation of revenue since the early 1900s. First, the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 authorized Congress to impose income taxes without apportioning it among the states on the basis of population, a burdensome provision that Article I, Section 9, had imposed on the national government. With this change, the federal government’s ability to raise revenue significantly increased and so did its ability to spend.

[.my2]
联邦、州和地方政府, 依靠不同的收入来源, 来支付其年度支出。2021 年，联邦政府的总收入（或收款）达到 4.3 万亿美元，各州为 2.5 万亿美元，地方政府为 1.6 万亿美元。 自 20 世纪初以来，两项重要发展从根本上改变了收入分配格局。首先，1913 年第十六修正案的批准, **授权国会征收"所得税"，**而无需像第一条第九款那样，根据人口比例,在各州之间分配税款。  这一变化显著提高了联邦政府的财政收入能力，同时也增强了其支出能力。

The second development regulates federal grants, that is, transfers of federal money to state and local governments. These transfers, which do not have to be repaid, are designed to support the activities of the recipient governments, but also to encourage them to pursue federal policy objectives they might not otherwise adopt. The expansion of the federal government’s spending power has enabled it to transfer more grant money to lower government levels, which has accounted for an increasing share of their total revenue.

[.my2]
第二项发展, 涉及"联邦拨款"的监管，即联邦政府向州和地方政府转移资金。这些无需偿还的"转移资金", 旨在支持受援政府的各项活动，同时也鼓励它们追求一些"它们原本可能不会采纳的联邦政策目标"。联邦政府支出能力的扩大, 使其能够向下级政府, 转移更多拨款，这在各级政府的总收入中所占比例越来越高。

The sources of revenue for federal, state, and local governments are detailed in Figure 3.4. Although the data reflect 2020 results, the patterns we see in the figure give us a good idea of how governments have funded their activities in recent years. For the federal government, 47 percent of 2020 revenue came from individual income taxes and 38 percent from payroll taxes, which combine Social Security tax and Medicare tax.

图 3.4 如图所示，联邦、州和地方政府的收入来源, 各不相同。

Three pie charts show Federal Government Revenue Sources in 2020, State Government Revenue Sources in 2018, and Local Government Revenue Sources in 2018. The Federal Government revenue sources in 2020 are split as follows: individual income taxes, 47%; payroll taxes, 38%; Corporate taxes, 6%; Excise taxes, 3%; other, 6%. State Government Revenue sources in 2018 are split as follows: Taxes, 39%; Federal support, 25%; Service charges, 15%; Other, 21%. A box appended to the taxes share of the state revenue is titled “Share of state taxes”. It lists property tax, 2%; sales tax, 47%; individual income tax, 38%. The Local Government Revenue sources in 2018 are split as follows: Taxes, 37 %; Federal and state support, 30%; Service charges, 20%; other, 13%. A box appended to the taxes share of the local government revenue is titled “share of local taxes”. It lists property tax, 72%; sales tax, 18%; individual income tax, 5%. At the bottom of the chart, the sources of information are listed: Congressional Budget Office; Office of Management and Budget. “Revenues, by Major Source, Since 1962.” The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2021 to 2031. February 2021. Office of Management and Budget, Table 2.2: “Percent Composition of Receipts by Source, 1934–2025.” whitehouse.gov. 2021. U.S. Census Bureau. “Table 1: State and Local Government Finances by Level of Government and by State, 2018.” 2018 Annual Surveys of State and Local Governments. 2018.



For state governments, 39 percent of revenue came from taxes, while 25 percent consisted of federal support. Sales tax—which includes taxes on purchased food, clothing, alcohol, amusements, insurance, motor fuels, tobacco products, and public utilities, for example—accounted for about 47 percent of total tax revenue, and individual income taxes represented roughly 38 percent. Revenue from service charges (e.g., tuition revenue from public universities and fees for hospital-related services) accounted for 15 percent.

[.my2]
**对州政府而言，39%的收入来自税收，25%来自联邦政府的拨款。**销售税（包括对食品、服装、酒类、娱乐、保险、燃油、烟草制品, 和公共事业等商品和服务征收的税）约占"税收总收入"的47%，个人所得税约占38%。服务费收入（例如公立大学的学费收入, 和医院相关服务的费用）占15%。

The tax structure of states varies. Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming do not have individual income taxes. Yet, such decisions on taxation reflect a classic tradeoff, as each state government must collect some mix of revenue in order to fund their chosen public services. These states find revenue through higher property taxes and through tax revenues related to tourism. Figure 3.5 illustrates yet another difference: Fuel tax as a percentage of total tax revenue is much higher in South Dakota and West Virginia than in Alaska and Hawaii. However, most states have done little to prevent the erosion of the fuel tax’s share of their total tax revenue between 2007 and 2019 (notice that for many states the dark blue dots for 2019 are to the left of the light blue numbers for 2007). Fuel tax revenue is typically used to finance state highway transportation projects, although some states do use it to fund non-transportation projects.

[.my2]
**各州的税收结构各不相同。**阿拉斯加州、佛罗里达州、内华达州、南达科他州、德克萨斯州、华盛顿州和怀俄明州, **不征收"个人所得税"。**然而，这种税收决策, 反映了一种经典的权衡取舍，因为每个州政府都必须征收某种形式的税收，才能为其选择的公共服务提供资金。*这些州通过较高的房产税, 和与旅游相关的税收, 来获取收入。* 图 3.5 显示了另一个差异：南达科他州, 和西弗吉尼亚州的燃油税, 占"总税收收入"的比例, 远高于阿拉斯加州和夏威夷州。然而，大多数州在 2007 年至 2019 年间, 几乎没有采取任何措施来阻止"燃油税"在其"总税收收入"中所占份额的下降（请注意，对于许多州而言，2019 年的深蓝色点, 位于 2007 年浅蓝色数字的左侧 ）。*"燃油税"收入, 通常用于资助州公路交通项目，尽管一些州也将其用于资助非交通项目。*

The most important sources of revenue for local governments in 2018 were taxes, federal and state grants, and service charges. For local governments the property tax, a levy on residential and commercial real estate, was the most important source of tax revenue, accounting for about 72 percent of the total. Federal and state grants accounted for 30 percent of local government revenue. Charges for hospital-related services, sewage and solid-waste management, public city university tuition, and airport services are important sources of general revenue for local governments.

**2018年地方政府**最重要的收入来源, 是税收、联邦和州政府拨款, 以及服务费。其中，**房产税（对住宅和商业地产征收的税款）是地方政府最重要的税收来源，约占总收入的72%。**联邦和州政府拨款, 占地方政府收入的30%。医院相关服务费、污水和固体废物管理费、公立大学学费, 以及机场服务费, 是地方政府重要的财政收入来源。

Intergovernmental grants are important sources of revenue for both state and local governments. When economic times are good, such grants help states, cities, municipalities, and townships carry out their regular functions. However, during hard economic times, such as the Great Recession of 2007–2009, intergovernmental transfers provide much-needed fiscal relief as the revenue streams of state and local governments dry up. During the Great Recession, tax receipts dropped as business activities slowed, consumer spending dropped, and family incomes decreased due to layoffs or work-hour reductions. To offset the adverse effects of the recession on the states and local governments, federal grants increased by roughly 33 percent during this period.


[.my2]
政府间拨款, 是州政府和地方政府的重要收入来源。经济形势良好时，此类拨款有助于各州、市、镇和乡镇, 履行其日常职能。然而，在经济困难时期，例如 2007-2009 年大衰退期间，由于州政府和地方政府的收入来源枯竭，政府间转移支付, 提供了急需的财政援助。在大衰退期间，随着商业活动放缓、消费支出下降, 以及因裁员或工时减少导致家庭收入减少，税收收入也随之下降。为了抵消"经济衰退"对州政府和地方政府的不利影响，联邦拨款在此期间增加了约 33%。

The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020–2021 ushered in a massive mobilization of activity and coordination at and between various levels of U.S. government in the hope of defeating the deadly virus that overwhelmed hospitals and led to nearly 600,000 deaths nationwide as well as a bleeding of state and local government jobs. The amount of federal funding to the states eclipsed the levels provided during the Great Recession. The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act passed by Congress and signed by President Biden included $350 billion in direct aid to state, local, and tribal governments. Furthermore, earlier in the pandemic, the CARES Act, signed by President Trump, established the $150 billion Coronavirus Relief Fund to aid these same governments. Many other federal funding flows occurred outside these two packages, including support for vaccinations and the vaccine rollout across the nation.

[.my2]
2020-2021 年的新冠肺炎疫情, 促使美国各级政府大规模动员起来，加强协调，以期战胜这种致命病毒。该病毒使医院不堪重负，导致全美近 60 万人死亡，并造成州和地方政府大量失业。联邦政府对各州的拨款额, 超过了经济大衰退时期的水平。国会通过并由拜登总统签署的 1.9 万亿美元的《美国救援计划法案》中，包括向州、地方和部落政府提供 3500 亿美元的直接援助。 此外，在疫情早期，特朗普总统签署的《新冠病毒援助、救济和经济安全法案》（CARES 法案）设立了 1500 亿美元的新冠病毒救济基金，用于援助上述各级政府。除上述两项法案外，还有许多其他联邦资金流入，包括支持疫苗接种, 和在全国范围内推广疫苗。

How are the revenues generated by our tax dollars, fees we pay to use public services and obtain licenses, and monies from other sources put to use by the different levels of government? A good starting point to gain insight on this question as it relates to the federal government is Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution. Recall, for instance, that the Constitution assigns the federal government various powers that allow it to affect the nation as a whole. A look at the federal budget in 2023 (Figure 3.6) shows that the three largest spending categories were Social Security (22 percent of the total budget); Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and marketplace subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (24 percent); and defense and international security assistance (13 percent). The rest was divided among categories such as safety net programs (15 percent), including the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit, unemployment insurance, food stamps, and other low-income assistance programs; interest on federal debt (11 percent); and non-defense discretionary spending (15 percent). It is clear from the 2023 federal budget that providing for the general welfare and national defense consumes much of the government’s resources—not just its revenue, but also its administrative capacity and labor power.

[.my2]
*我们的税款*、使用公共服务, 和获得许可证所缴纳的费用, 以及其他来源的资金，**是如何被各级政府使用的？**要深入了解联邦政府的运作方式，宪法第一条第八款是一个很好的切入点。例如，宪法赋予联邦政府各种权力，使其能够影响整个国家。2023 年的联邦预算（ 图 3.6 ）显示，三大支出类别分别是：社会保障（占总预算的 22%）；医疗保险、医疗补助、儿童健康保险计划, 以及根据《平价医疗法案》提供的市场补贴（24%）；以及国防和国际安全援助（13%）。其余部分, 则分配在以下类别中：社会保障项目（15%），包括劳动所得税抵免, 和儿童税收抵免、失业保险、食品券和其他低收入援助项目；联邦债务利息（11%）；以及非国防可自由支配支出（15%）。  *从 2023 年联邦预算中可以清楚地看出，保障公众福利和国防, 消耗了政府的大量资源*——不仅是财政收入，还有行政能力和劳动力。

Figure 3.7 compares recent spending activities of local and state governments. Educational expenditures constitute a major category for both. However, whereas the states spend comparatively more than local governments on university education, local governments spend even more on elementary and secondary education. That said, nationwide, state funding for public higher education has declined as a percentage of university revenues; this is primarily because states have taken in lower amounts of sales taxes as internet commerce has increased. Local governments allocate more funds to police protection, fire protection, housing and community development, and public utilities such as water, sewage, and electricity. And while state governments allocate comparatively more funds to public welfare programs, such as health care, income support, and highways, both local and state governments spend roughly similar amounts on judicial and legal services and correctional services.
