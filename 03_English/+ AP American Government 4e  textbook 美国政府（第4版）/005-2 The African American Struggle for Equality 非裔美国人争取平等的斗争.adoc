== 释义



Many groups in U.S. history have sought recognition as equal citizens. Although each group’s efforts have been notable and important, arguably the greatest, longest, and most violent struggle remains that of African Americans, whose dehumanization was even written into the text of the Constitution in the clause counting them as three fifths of a person. Their fight for freedom and equality provided the legal and moral foundation for others who sought recognition of their equality later on.

美国历史上许多群体都曾争取过平等的公民权利。尽管每个群体的努力都卓著且意义重大，但可以说，最伟大、最漫长、也最激烈的斗争当属非裔美国人的斗争。他们甚至被写入宪法，宪法中有一条条款规定他们只算作五分之三个人，这无疑是对他们非人待遇的直接体现。他们为自由和平等而战，为后来其他争取平等权利的人们奠定了法律和道德基础。

SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR
奴隶制与内战
In the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson made the radical statement that “all men are created equal” and “are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” Yet, like other wealthy landowners of his time, Jefferson also owned dozens of other human beings as his personal property. He recognized this contradiction, personally considered the institution of slavery to be a “hideous blot” on the nation, and agreed to free those he held in bondage upon his death.13 However, to forge a political union that would stand the test of time, he and the other founders—and later the framers of the Constitution—chose not to address the issue in any definitive way. Political support for abolition was very much a minority stance in the United States at the time, although after the Revolution many of the northern states followed the European example of fifty years prior in abolishing slavery.14
在《独立宣言》中，托马斯· 杰斐逊发表了激进的宣言：“人人生而平等”，“造物主赋予他们若干不可剥夺的权利，其中包括生命权、自由权和追求幸福的权利”。然而，与当时其他富有的地主一样，杰斐逊也拥有数十名奴隶作为其个人财产。他意识到这种矛盾，并个人认为奴隶制是国家的“丑陋污点”，并承诺在他去世后释放所有被奴役的人。 13 然而，为了建立一个经得起时间考验的政治联盟，他和其它开国元勋——以及后来的宪法制定者——选择不以任何明确的方式处理这个问题。当时，支持废奴的政治立场在美国属于少数派，尽管在独立战争之后，许多北方州效仿五十年前欧洲的做法废除了奴隶制。 14

As the new United States expanded westward, however, the issue of slavery became harder to ignore and ignited much controversy. Many opponents of slavery were willing to accept the institution if it remained largely confined to the South but did not want it to spread westward. They feared the expansion of slavery would lead to the political dominance of the South over the North and would deprive small farmers in the newly acquired western territories who could not afford to enslave others.15 Abolitionists, primarily in the North, argued that slavery was immoral and contrary to the nation's values and demanded an end to it.

[.my2]
然而，随着新生的美国向西扩张，奴隶制问题变得难以忽视，并引发了诸多争议。许多反对奴隶制的人愿意接受奴隶制的存在，只要它主要局限于南方，但他们不希望奴隶制向西蔓延。他们担心奴隶制的扩张会导致南方在政治上凌驾于北方之上，并剥夺新近获得的西部领土上那些无力奴役他人的小农的生存空间。15 废奴主义者，主要来自北方，认为奴隶制是不道德的，违背了国家的价值观，并要求废除奴隶制。

The spread of slavery into the West seemed inevitable, however, following the Supreme Court’s 1857 ruling in the case Dred Scott v. Sandford.16 The justices rejected Scott's argument that though he had been born into slavery, his time spent in free states and territories where slavery had been banned by the federal government had made him a free man. In fact, the Court’s majority stated that Scott had no legal right to sue for his freedom at all because Black people (whether free or enslaved) were not, and could not become, U.S. citizens. Thus, Scott lacked the standing to even appear before the court. The Court also held that Congress lacked the power to decide whether slavery would be permitted in a territory that had been acquired after the Constitution was ratified. This decision had the effect of prohibiting the federal government from passing any laws that would limit the expansion of slavery into any part of the West.

[.my2]
然而，1857 年最高法院在 “德雷德·斯科特诉桑福德案”中作出裁决后，奴隶制向西部扩张似乎已不可避免。 16 大法官们驳回了斯科特的论点，即尽管他生于奴隶家庭，但他在联邦政府已禁止奴隶制的自由州和领地生活的时间使他成为了自由人。事实上，法院多数派认为，斯科特根本没有权利就其自由提起诉讼，因为黑人（无论自由还是奴隶）都不是，也不可能成为美国公民。因此，斯科特甚至没有资格出庭。法院还裁定，国会无权决定在宪法批准后获得的领土上是否允许奴隶制。这一裁决实际上禁止联邦政府通过任何限制奴隶制向西部扩张的法律。

Ultimately, of course, the issue was decided by the Civil War (1861–1865), with the southern states seceding to defend "states’ rights,” specifically, the purported right to own human property, without federal interference.17 Although at the beginning of the war, President Abraham Lincoln had been willing to allow slavery to continue in the South to preserve the Union, he changed his policies regarding abolition over the course of the war. The first step was the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863 (Figure 5.4). Although it stated “all persons held as slaves . . . henceforward shall be free,” the proclamation was limited in effect to the states that had rebelled. Enslaved people in states that had remained within the Union, such as Maryland and Delaware were not set free, nor were they in parts of the Confederacy already occupied by the Union army. Although enslaved people in rebel states were freed by federal decree, the relatively small Union troop presence made it impossible to enforce their release from bondage.18
当然，最终这个问题是由内战 （1861-1865）解决的，南方各州脱离联邦，以捍卫所谓的“州权”，具体而言，就是捍卫其拥有奴隶的权利，不受联邦政府的干预。 17 尽管在战争初期，亚伯拉罕· 林肯总统为了维护联邦的统一，曾愿意允许南方继续存在奴隶制，但在战争过程中，他改变了废奴政策。第一步是于 1863 年 1 月 1 日颁布《 解放奴隶宣言》 （ 图 5.4 ）。该宣言虽然宣称“所有被奴役的人……从此以后都将获得自由”，但其效力仅限于叛乱的各州。留在联邦内的各州，例如马里兰州和特拉华州，以及已被联邦军队占领的南方邦联部分地区的奴隶，都没有获得解放。尽管叛乱州的奴隶根据联邦法令获得解放，但由于联邦军队驻扎规模相对较小，因此无法强制执行解放奴隶的法令 。18

Despite popular belief, the Emancipation Proclamation (b) actually freed very few enslaved people, though it did change the meaning of the war.

RECONSTRUCTION  重建
At the end of the Civil War, the South entered a period called Reconstruction (1865–1877) during which state governments were reorganized before the rebellious states were allowed to be readmitted to the Union. As part of this process, the Republican Party pushed for a permanent end to slavery. A constitutional amendment to this effect was passed by the House of Representatives in January of 1865, after having already been approved by the Senate in April of 1864, and it was ratified in December of 1865 as the Thirteenth Amendment. The amendment’s first section states, “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.” In effect, this amendment outlawed slavery in the United States.

[.my2]
内战结束后，南方进入了重建时期（1865-1877 年）。在此期间，各州政府进行了重组，之后叛乱州才被允许重新加入联邦。作为这一进程的一部分，共和党力主永久废除奴隶制。一项旨在废除奴隶制的宪法修正案于 1865 年 1 月由众议院通过，此前该修正案已于 1864 年 4 月获得参议院批准。该修正案于 1865 年 12 月获得批准，成为第十三修正案 。修正案第一条规定：“除因犯罪而被依法判处刑罚外，奴隶制或强迫劳动不得存在于美国境内或受其管辖的任何地方。” 实际上，这项修正案在美国废除了奴隶制。

The changes wrought by the Fourteenth Amendment were more extensive. In addition to introducing the equal protection clause to the Constitution, this amendment also extended the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the states, required the states to respect the privileges or immunities of all citizens, and, for the first time, defined citizenship at the national and state levels. People could no longer be excluded from citizenship based solely on their race. Although lack of political or judicial action rendered some of these provisions toothless, others were pivotal in the expansion of civil rights.

[.my2]
第十四修正案带来的变革更为深远。除了在宪法中引入平等保护条款外，该修正案还将第五修正案的正当程序条款扩展至各州，要求各州尊重所有公民的特权或豁免权，并首次在国家和州层面界定了公民身份。人们不再能仅仅因为种族而被剥夺公民权。尽管由于缺乏政治或司法行动，其中一些条款形同虚设，但另一些条款在扩大公民权利方面发挥了关键作用。

The Fifteenth Amendment stated that people could not be denied the right to vote based on “race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” This construction allowed states to continue to decide the qualifications of voters as long as those qualifications seemed to be race-neutral. Thus, while states could not deny Black people the right to vote on the basis of race, they could deny it on any number of arbitrary grounds such as literacy, landownership, affluence, or political knowledge.

[.my2]
第十五修正案规定，不得以“种族、肤色或先前的奴役状况”为由剥夺任何人的投票权。这一解释使得各州可以继续自行决定选民资格，只要这些资格看似与种族无关。因此，虽然各州不能以种族为由剥夺黑人的投票权，但它们可以以识字能力、土地所有权、财富或政治知识等诸多任意理由剥夺黑人的投票权。

Although the immediate effect of these provisions was quite profound, over time the Republicans in Congress gradually lost interest in pursuing Reconstruction policies, and the Reconstruction ended with the end of military rule in the South and the withdrawal of the Union army in 1877.19 Following the army’s removal, political control of the South fell once again into the hands of White men, and violence was used to discourage Black people from exercising the rights they had been granted.20 The revocation of voting rights, or disenfranchisement, took a number of forms; not every southern state used the same methods, and some states used more than one, but they all disproportionately affected Black voter registration and turnout.21
尽管这些条款的直接影响十分深远，但随着时间的推移，国会中的共和党人逐渐对重建政策失去了兴趣，重建最终随着南方军事统治的结束和联邦军队于 1877 年撤离而告终 。19 军队撤离后，南方的政治控制权再次落入白人手中，暴力被用来阻止黑人行使他们被赋予的权利。 20 剥夺投票权（或称选举权剥夺 ）采取了多种形式；并非所有南方州都采用相同的方法，有些州甚至采用了不止一种方法，但所有这些方法都对黑人的选民登记和投票率产生了不成比例的影响。 21

Perhaps the most famous of the tools of disenfranchisement were literacy tests and understanding tests. Literacy tests, which had been used in the North since the 1850s to disqualify naturalized European immigrants from voting, called on the prospective voter to demonstrate his (and later, her) ability to read a particular passage of text. However, since voter registration officials had discretion to decide what text the voter was to read, they could give easy passages to voters they wanted to register (typically, white people) and more difficult passages to those whose registration they wanted to deny (typically, Black people). Understanding tests required the prospective voter to explain the meaning of a particular passage of text, often a provision of the U.S. Constitution, or answer a series of questions related to citizenship. Again, since the official examining the prospective voter could decide which passage or questions to choose, the difficulty of the test might vary dramatically between African American and white applicants.22 Even had these tests been administered fairly and equitably, however, most African Americans would have been at a huge disadvantage, because few had been taught to read. Although schools for Black people had existed in some places, southern states had made it largely illegal to teach enslaved people to read and write. At the beginning of the Civil War, only 5 percent of Black people could read and write, and most of them lived in the North.23 Some were able to take advantage of educational opportunities after they were freed, but many were not able to gain effective literacy.

[.my2]
剥夺选举权的手段中，最著名的或许要数识字测试和理解力测试了。识字测试自 19 世纪 50 年代起便在北方地区使用，目的是剥夺已入籍的欧洲移民的投票权。这种测试要求潜在选民证明自己（后来也包括女性）能够阅读一段特定的文字。然而，由于选民登记官员有权决定选民需要阅读的文字内容，他们可以给想要登记的选民（通常是白人）提供简单的段落，而给他们想要拒绝登记的人（通常是黑人）提供更难的段落。理解力测试则要求潜在选民解释一段特定文字的含义 ，这段文字通常是美国宪法的条款，或者回答一系列与公民身份相关的问题。同样，由于审查潜在选民的官员可以决定选择哪段文字或哪些问题，因此测试的难度在非裔美国人和白人申请者之间可能存在显著差异。 22 然而，即便这些测试能够公平公正地进行，大多数非裔美国人仍然会处于极大的劣势，因为很少有人接受过阅读教育。虽然有些地方设有黑人学校 ， 但南方各州基本上禁止教奴隶读写。内战初期，只有 5%的黑人识字，而且他们大多居住在北方。23 一些人在获得自由后能够利用教育机会，但许多人仍然无法真正掌握读写能力。

In some states, poorer, less-literate white voters feared being disenfranchised by the literacy and understanding tests. Some states introduced a loophole, known as the grandfather clause, to allow less literate white people to vote. The grandfather clause exempted those who had been allowed to vote in that state prior to the Civil War and their descendants from literacy and understanding tests.24 Because Black people were not allowed to vote prior to the Civil War, but most White men had been voting at a time when there were no literacy tests, this loophole allowed most illiterate white people to vote (Figure 5.5) while leaving obstacles in place for Black people who wanted to vote as well. Time limits were often placed on these provisions because state legislators realized that they might quickly be declared unconstitutional, but they lasted long enough to allow illiterate White men to register to vote.25
在一些州，贫困且文化程度较低的白人选民担心会因识字和理解能力测试而被剥夺选举权。一些州引入了一项被称为“ 祖父条款” 的漏洞，允许文化程度较低的白人投票。该条款豁免了内战前在该州获得投票权的人及其后代接受识字和理解能力测试。 24 由于黑人在内战前没有投票权，而大多数白人男性在没有识字测试的时期就已经拥有投票权，因此这项漏洞使得大多数不识字的白人能够投票（ 图 5.5 ），同时却给想要投票的黑人设置了障碍。这些条款通常设有时间限制，因为州立法者意识到它们可能很快就会被宣布违宪，但它们持续的时间足以让不识字的白人男性登记投票。 25

[.my2]
图 5.5 一幅 1879 年的杂志漫画讽刺了南方一些不识字的白人要求黑人必须先接受教育才能投票的做法。祖父条款使得这种情况成为可能。
In states where the voting rights of poor white people were less of a concern, another tool for disenfranchisement was the poll tax (Figure 5.6). This was an annual per-person tax, typically one or two dollars (on the order of $20 to $50 today), that a person had to pay to register to vote. People who didn’t want to vote didn’t have to pay, but in several states the poll tax was cumulative, so if you decided to vote you would have to pay not only the tax due for that year but any poll tax from previous years as well. Because formerly enslaved people were usually quite poor, they were less likely than White men to be able to pay poll taxes.26
在一些州，贫困白人的投票权问题并不那么受关注，剥夺他们投票权的另一种手段是人头税 （ 图 5.6 ）。这是一种按人头征收的年度税，通常为一到两美元（相当于今天的 20 到 50 美元），人们必须缴纳此税才能登记投票。不想投票的人不必缴纳，但在一些州，人头税是累积性的，因此，如果你决定投票，你不仅要缴纳当年的税款，还要缴纳之前年份的税款。由于曾经的奴隶通常非常贫困，他们比白人男性更难缴纳人头税。 26

Although these methods were usually sufficient to ensure that Black people were kept away from the polls, some dedicated African Americans did manage to register to vote despite the obstacles placed in their way. To ensure their vote was largely meaningless, the White elites used their control of the Democratic Party to create the white primary: primary elections in which only White people were allowed to vote. The state party organizations argued that as private groups, rather than part of the state government, they had no obligation to follow the Fifteenth Amendment’s requirement not to deny the right to vote on the basis of race. Furthermore, they contended, voting for nominees to run for office was not the same as electing those who would actually hold office. So they held primary elections to choose the Democratic nominee in which only White citizens were allowed to vote.27 Once the nominee had been chosen, they might face token opposition from a Republican or minor-party candidate in the general election, but since White voters had agreed beforehand to support whoever won the Democrats’ primary, the outcome of the general election was a foregone conclusion.

[.my2]
尽管这些方法通常足以阻止黑人参与投票，但一些意志坚定的非裔美国人还是克服重重阻碍成功登记投票。为了确保他们的选票毫无意义，白人精英利用他们对民主党的控制，搞出了“ 白人初选” ：只有白人才能参加的初选。各州党组织辩称，作为私人团体而非州政府的一部分，他们没有义务遵守第十五修正案关于不得以种族为由剥夺公民投票权的规定。此外，他们还认为，投票选举候选人与选举实际任职者并不相同。因此，他们举行了只有白人公民才能参加的民主党初选，以选出民主党候选人。27 一旦候选人确定，他们在普选中可能会面临共和党或小党派候选人的象征性挑战，但由于白人选民事先已经同意支持民主党初选的获胜者，普选结果早已注定。

With Black people effectively disenfranchised, the restored southern state governments undermined guarantees of equal treatment in the Fourteenth Amendment. They passed laws that excluded African Americans from juries and allowed the imprisonment and forced labor of “idle” Black citizens. The laws also called for segregation of White and Black people in public places under the doctrine known as “separate but equal.” As long as nominally equal facilities were provided for both races, it was legal to require members of each race to use the facilities designated for them. Similarly, state and local governments passed laws limiting neighborhoods in which Black and White people could live. Collectively, these discriminatory laws came to be known as Jim Crow laws. The Supreme Court upheld the separate but equal doctrine in 1896 in Plessy v. Ferguson, inconsistent with the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clause, and allowed segregation to continue.28
由于黑人实际上被剥夺了选举权，复辟的南方各州政府破坏了第十四修正案中关于平等对待的保障。他们通过法律，将非裔美国人排除在陪审团之外，并允许监禁和强迫“游手好闲”的黑人公民劳动。这些法律还要求在公共场所实行白人和黑人的隔离，其依据是所谓的“隔离但平等”原则。只要名义上为两个种族提供平等的设施，就可以合法地要求每个种族的成员使用为其指定的设施。同样，州和地方政府也通过法律限制黑人和白人居住的社区。这些歧视性法律统称为 “吉姆·克劳法” 。1896 年，最高法院在 “普莱西诉弗格森案” 中维持了“隔离但平等”原则，这与第十四修正案的平等保护条款相悖，并允许种族隔离继续存在。 28

CIVIL RIGHTS IN THE COURTS
法庭上的公民权利
By the turn of the twentieth century, the position of African Americans was quite bleak. Even outside the South, racial inequality was a fact of everyday life. African American leaders and thinkers themselves disagreed on the right path forward. Some, like Booker T. Washington, argued that acceptance of inequality and segregation over the short term would allow African Americans to focus their efforts on improving their educational and social status until White people were forced to acknowledge them as equals. W. E. B. Du Bois, however, argued for a more confrontational approach and in 1909 founded the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) as a rallying point for securing equality. White liberals dominated the organization in its early years, but Black people assumed control over its operations in the 1920s.29
到了二十世纪初，非裔美国人的处境十分艰难。即使在南方以外的地区，种族不平等也是日常生活中普遍存在的现象。非裔美国人的领袖和思想家们对于未来的正确道路也存在分歧。一些人，例如布克·T·华盛顿，认为短期内接受不平等和种族隔离，可以让非裔美国人集中精力改善自身的教育和社会地位，直到白人被迫承认他们与白人平等。然而，W·E·B· 杜波依斯则主张采取更具对抗性的方式，并于 1909 年创立了全国有色人种协进会 （NAACP），以此作为争取平等的集结地。在 NAACP 成立初期，白人自由派人士占据主导地位，但到了 20 世纪 20 年代，黑人逐渐掌控了该组织的运作。 29

The NAACP soon focused on a strategy of overturning Jim Crow laws through the courts. Perhaps its greatest series of legal successes consisted of its efforts to challenge segregation in education. Early cases brought by the NAACP dealt with racial discrimination in higher education. In 1938, the Supreme Court essentially gave states a choice: they could either integrate institutions of higher education, or they could establish an equivalent university or college for African Americans.30 Southern states chose to establish colleges for Black people rather than allow them into all-White state institutions. Although this ruling expanded opportunities for professional and graduate education in areas such as law and medicine for African Americans by requiring states to provide institutions for them to attend, it nevertheless allowed segregated colleges and universities to continue to exist.

[.my2]
全国有色人种协进会（NAACP）很快将战略重心转移到通过法律途径推翻吉姆·克劳法。其最辉煌的法律成就或许在于挑战教育领域的种族隔离。NAACP 早期提起的诉讼主要针对高等教育中的种族歧视。1938 年，最高法院实际上给了各州一个选择：要么整合高等教育机构，要么为非裔美国人建立同等的大学或学院。南方 30 个州选择为黑人建立学院，而不是允许他们进入全白人州立院校。尽管这项裁决要求各州提供院校，从而扩大了非裔美国人在法律和医学等领域接受专业和研究生教育的机会，但它仍然允许种族隔离的学院和大学继续存在。

The landmark court decision of the judicial phase of the civil rights movement settled the Brown v. Board of Education case in 1954.31 In this case, the Supreme Court unanimously overturned its decision in Plessy v. Ferguson as it pertained to public education, stating that a separate but equal education was a logical impossibility. Even with the same funding and equivalent facilities, a segregated school could not have the same teachers or environment as the equivalent school for another race. The court also rested its decision in part on social science studies suggesting that racial discrimination led to feelings of inferiority among Black children. The only way to dispel this sense of inferiority was to end segregation and integrate public schools.

[.my2]
1954 年， 布朗诉教育委员会案（Brown v. Board of Education） 成为民权运动司法阶段的里程碑式判决。 31 在此案中，最高法院一致推翻了其在普莱西诉弗格森案（Plessy v. Ferguson） 中关于公立教育的判决，指出“隔离但平等的教育”在逻辑上是不可能的。即使拥有相同的资金和同等的设施，种族隔离的学校也无法拥有与另一种族学校相同的师资和环境。法院的判决部分依据社会科学研究，这些研究表明种族歧视会导致黑人儿童产生自​​卑感。消除这种自卑感的唯一途径是结束种族隔离，实现公立学校的种族融合。

It is safe to say this ruling was controversial. While integration of public schools took place without much incident in some areas of the South, particularly where there were few Black students, elsewhere, it was confrontational—or nonexistent. In recognition of the fact that southern states would delay school integration for as long as possible, civil rights activists urged the federal government to enforce the Supreme Court’s decision. Bayard Rustin and A. Philip Randolph organized a Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom in Washington, DC, on May 17, 1957, in which approximately twenty-five thousand African Americans participated.32
可以肯定地说，这项裁决极具争议。虽然在南方一些地区，特别是黑人学生较少的地区，公立学校的种族融合进行得相对顺利，但在其他地区，种族融合却充满对抗，甚至根本没有发生。鉴于南方各州会尽可能拖延学校种族融合，民权活动家敦促联邦政府执行最高法院的裁决。1957 年 5 月 17 日，贝亚德 ·拉斯汀和 A·菲利普 ·伦道夫在华盛顿特区组织了一场“自由祈祷朝圣之旅”，约有两万五千名非裔美国人参加。 32

A few months later, in Little Rock, Arkansas, governor Orval Faubus resisted court-ordered integration and mobilized National Guard troops to keep Black students out of Central High School. President Eisenhower then called up the Arkansas National Guard for federal duty (essentially taking the troops out of Faubus’s hands) and sent soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division to escort students to and from classes, as shown in Figure 5.7. To avoid integration, Faubus closed four high schools in Little Rock the following school year.33
几个月后，在阿肯色州小石城，州长奥瓦尔 ·福布斯拒绝执行法院强制执行的种族融合令，并调动国民警卫队阻止黑人学生进入中央高中。随后， 艾森豪威尔总统征召阿肯色州国民警卫队执行联邦任务（实际上是将部队从福布斯手中解救出来），并派遣第 101 空降师的士兵护送学生上下学，如图 5.7 所示。为了避免种族融合，福布斯在接下来的学年关闭了小石城的四所高中。 33

In Virginia, state leaders employed a strategy of “massive resistance” to school integration, which led to the closure of a large number of public schools across the state, some for years.34 Although de jure segregation, segregation mandated by law, had ended on paper, in practice, few efforts were made to integrate schools in most school districts with substantial Black student populations until the late 1960s. Many White southerners who objected to sending their children to school with Black students then established private academies that admitted only White students; many of these schools remain overwhelmingly White today.35
在弗吉尼亚州，州领导人对学校种族融合采取了“大规模抵制”的策略，导致全州大量公立学校关闭，其中一些学校关闭长达数年。 34 虽然法律规定的种族隔离在纸面上已经结束，但实际上，直到 20 世纪 60 年代末，大多数黑人学生比例较高的学区才开始真正努力实现学校种族融合。许多反对让自己的孩子与黑人学生一起上学的南方白人随后创办了只招收白人学生的私立学校；时至今日，这些学校中仍有许多是白人学生占绝大多数。 35

School and other segregation was and is hardly limited to the South. Many neighborhoods in northern cities remain segregated by virtue of "red lining" districts where minorities were allowed and not allowed to live. Restrictive real estate covenants bound White residents to not sell their houses to African Americans and sometimes not to Chinese, Japanese, Mexicans, Filipinos, Jews, and other ethnic minorities. In New York City in the late 1950s, a group of activist parents led by Mae Mallory protested the inadequate schools in their neighborhood; a court ruled that New York was engaging in de facto segregation, and forced the city to institute policies that would provide more equitable access.36 More recently, banks have been fined for not lending to people of color to buy homes and start business at rates commensurate with similarly situated prospective White borrowers. Relegation of minority residents to less desirable neighborhoods has the practical effect of diminishing both generational wealth, and the tax base needed to build, maintain, and improve schools and other institutions that might hasten equality and integration.

学校和其他领域的种族隔离并非南方独有，至今依然存在。北方许多城市的社区仍然因为“红线区”政策而处于隔离状态，少数族裔被允许或禁止居住在某些区域。限制性的房地产契约约束白人居民不得将房屋出售给非裔美国人，有时甚至禁止出售给华人、日本人、墨西哥人、菲律宾人、犹太人和其他少数族裔。20 世纪 50 年代末，在纽约市，一群由梅·马洛里领导的家长维权人士抗议社区内学校条件恶劣；法院裁定纽约市实际上存在种族隔离，并迫使市政府制定政策，以提供更公平的教育机会。 36 近年来，一些银行因未能以与条件相似的白人借款人相当的利率向有色人种提供购房和创业贷款而被罚款。将少数族裔居民限制在条件较差的社区，实际上会减少他们的世代财富，并削弱用于建设、维护和改善学校及其他可能加速平等和融合的机构所需的税基。

In the postwar era of White flight, however, the Supreme Court had been evolving into a more progressive force in the promotion and preservation of civil rights. In the case of Shelley v. Kraemer (1948), the Supreme Court held that while such covenants did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment because they consisted of agreements between private citizens, their provisions could not be enforced by courts.37 Because state courts are government institutions and the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the government from denying people equal protection of the law, the courts’ enforcement of such covenants would be a violation of the amendment. Thus, if a White family chose to sell its house to a Black family and the other homeowners in the neighborhood tried to sue the seller, the court would not hear the case. In 1967, the Supreme Court struck down a Virginia law that prohibited interracial marriage in Loving v. Virginia.38
然而，在战后白人外迁时期，最高法院在促进和维护公民权利方面逐渐转变为一股更为进步的力量。在谢利诉克雷默案（1948 年）中，最高法院裁定，虽然此类契约并不违反第十四修正案，因为它们是私人公民之间的协议，但法院无权强制执行其条款。 37 由于州法院是政府机构，而第十四修正案禁止政府剥夺公民享有平等法律保护的权利，因此法院强制执行此类契约将违反该修正案。因此，如果一个白人家庭选择将房屋出售给一个黑人家庭，而邻居们试图起诉卖方，法院将不会受理此案。1967 年，最高法院在洛文诉​​弗吉尼亚州案中推翻了弗吉尼亚州一项禁止跨种族婚姻的法律。 38

LEGISLATING CIVIL RIGHTS
制定公民权利法
Beyond these favorable court rulings, however, progress toward equality for African Americans remained slow in the 1950s. In 1962, Congress proposed what later became the Twenty-Fourth Amendment, which banned the poll tax in elections to federal (but not state or local) office; the amendment went into effect after being ratified in early 1964. Several southern states continued to require residents to pay poll taxes in order to vote in state elections until 1966 when, in the case of Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections, the Supreme Court declared that requiring payment of a poll tax in order to vote in an election at any level was unconstitutional.39
然而，尽管有这些有利的法院判决，20 世纪 50 年代非裔美国人争取平等的进程依然缓慢。1962 年，国会提出了后来成为第二十四修正案的提案 ，该修正案禁止在联邦（但不包括州或地方）公职选举中征收人头税；该修正案于 1964 年初获得批准后生效。一些南方州继续要求居民缴纳人头税才能参加州选举，直到 1966 年，最高法院在 “哈珀诉弗吉尼亚州选举委员会案”中裁定，要求缴纳人头税才能参加任何级别的选举均属违宪。 39

The slow rate of progress led to frustration within the Black community. Newer, grassroots organizations such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) challenged the NAACP’s position as the leading civil rights organization and questioned its legal-focused strategy. These newer groups tended to prefer more confrontational approaches, including the use of direct action campaigns relying on marches and demonstrations. The strategies of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience, or the refusal to obey an unjust law, had been effective in the campaign led by Mahatma Gandhi to liberate colonial India from British rule in the 1930s and 1940s. Civil rights pioneers adopted these measures in the 1955–1956 Montgomery bus boycott. After Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat to a White person and was arrested, a group of Black women carried out a day-long boycott of Montgomery’s public transit system. This boycott was then extended for over a year and overseen by union organizer E. D. Nixon. The effort desegregated public transportation in that city.40
进展缓慢导致黑人社区感到沮丧。一些新兴的草根组织，例如南方基督教领袖会议 （SCLC）、 种族平等大会 （CORE）和学生非暴力协调委员会 （SNCC），挑战了全国有色人种协进会（NAACP）作为领先的民权组织的地位，并质疑其以法律为导向的策略。这些新兴组织倾向于采取更具对抗性的方式，包括依靠游行示威等直接行动 。非暴力抵抗和公民不服从 （即拒绝服从不公正的法律）的策略，在 20 世纪 30 年代和 40 年代圣雄甘地领导的将印度从英国殖民统治下解放出来的运动中发挥了有效作用。民权运动的先驱们在 1955 年至 1956 年的蒙哥马利巴士抵制运动中也采用了这些措施。罗莎 ·帕克斯拒绝将公交车座位让给白人后被捕，一群黑人妇女随即发起了一场为期一天的蒙哥马利公共交通系统抵制活动。这场抵制活动随后持续了一年多，并由工会组织者埃德·尼克松领导。最终，这场运动实现了该市公共交通系统的种族融合 。40

Direct action also took such forms as the sit-in campaigns to desegregate lunch counters that began in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1960, and the 1961 Freedom Rides in which Black and White volunteers rode buses and trains through the South to enforce a 1946 Supreme Court decision that desegregated interstate transportation (Morgan v. Virginia).41 While such focused campaigns could be effective, they often had little impact in places where they were not replicated. In addition, some of the campaigns led to violence against both the campaigns’ leaders and ordinary people; Rosa Parks, a longtime NAACP member and graduate of the Highlander Folk School for civil rights activists, whose actions had begun the Montgomery boycott, received death threats, E. D. Nixon’s home was bombed, and the Freedom Riders were attacked in Alabama.42
直接行动的形式还包括 1960 年始于北卡罗来纳州格林斯伯勒的旨在废除午餐柜台种族隔离的静坐运动，以及 1961 年的“自由乘车运动”。在“自由乘车运动”中，黑人和白人志愿者乘坐公共汽车和火车穿越南方，以执行 1946 年最高法院关于废除州际交通种族隔离的裁决（ 摩根诉弗吉尼亚州案）。 41 虽然这类有针对性的运动可能有效，但在没有被效仿的地方，它们往往收效甚微。此外，一些运动还导致了针对运动领导者和普通民众的暴力事件；长期担任全国有色人种协进会成员、毕业于民权活动家高地民俗学校的罗莎·帕克斯，因其发起的蒙哥马利抵制运动而收到死亡威胁；埃德加·尼克松的住所遭到炸弹袭击；“ 自由乘车运动 ”参与者在阿拉巴马州遭到袭击。 42

As the campaign for civil rights continued and gained momentum, President John F. Kennedy called for Congress to pass new civil rights legislation, which began to work its way through Congress in 1963. The resulting law (pushed heavily and then signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson after Kennedy’s assassination) was the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which had wide-ranging effects on U.S. society. Not only did the act outlaw government discrimination and the unequal application of voting qualifications by race, but it also, for the first time, outlawed segregation and other forms of discrimination by most businesses that were open to the public, including hotels, theaters, and restaurants that were not private clubs. It outlawed discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, or national origin by most employers, and it created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to monitor employment discrimination claims and help enforce this provision of the law. The provisions that affected private businesses and employers were legally justified not by the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection of the laws but instead by Congress’s power to regulate interstate commerce.43
随着民权运动的持续推进和不断壮大，约翰·F· 肯尼迪总统呼吁国会通过新的民权法案，该法案于 1963 年开始在国会审议。最终通过的法案（在肯尼迪遇刺后，由林登·B· 约翰逊总统签署生效）即 1964 年 《民权法案》 ，对美国社会产生了深远的影响。该法案不仅禁止政府歧视和基于种族的投票资格不平等，而且首次禁止了大多数面向公众开放的企业（包括酒店、剧院和非私人俱乐部的餐馆）的种族隔离和其他形式的歧视。该法案禁止大多数雇主基于种族、民族、宗教、性别或国籍进行歧视，并设立了平等就业机会委员会 （EEOC），负责监督就业歧视案件并协助执行该法案的这项规定。影响私营企业和雇主的这些条款，其法律依据并非第十四修正案保障的法律平等保护，而是国会监管州际贸易的权力 。43

Even though the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had a monumental impact over the long term, it did not end efforts by many southern White people to maintain the White-dominated political power structure in the region. Progress in registering African American voters remained slow in many states despite increased federal activity supporting it, so civil rights leaders including Martin Luther King, Jr. decided to draw the public eye to the area where the greatest resistance to voter registration drives were taking place. The SCLC and SNCC particularly focused their attention on the city of Selma, Alabama, which had been the site of violent reactions against civil rights activities.

[.my2]
尽管 1964 年的《民权法案》从长远来看产生了巨大的影响，但它并未阻止许多南方白人为维护该地区白人主导的政治权力结构而做出的努力。尽管联邦政府加大了支持力度，但许多州的非裔美国选民登记工作进展仍然缓慢。因此，包括马丁· 路德 ·金在内的民权领袖决定将公众的注意力引向选民登记运动阻力最大的地区。南方基督教领袖会议（SCLC）和学生非暴力协调委员会（SNCC）尤其关注阿拉巴马州塞尔玛市，该市曾发生过针对民权活动的暴力事件。

The organizations’ leaders planned a march from Selma to Montgomery in March 1965. Their first attempt to march was violently broken up by state police and sheriff’s deputies (Figure 5.8). The second attempt was aborted because King feared it would lead to a brutal confrontation with police and violate a court order from a federal judge who had been sympathetic to the movement in the past. That night, three of the marchers, White ministers from the north, were attacked and beaten with clubs by members of the Ku Klux Klan; one of the victims died from his injuries. Televised images of the brutality against protesters and the death of a minister led to greater public sympathy for the cause. Eventually, a third march was successful in reaching the state capital of Montgomery.44
这些组织的领导人计划于 1965 年 3 月从塞尔玛游行至蒙哥马利。他们的第一次游行尝试遭到州警和治安官的暴力镇压（ 图 5.8 ）。第二次尝试因金担心会导致与警方发生残酷冲突，并违反一位过去曾同情该运动的联邦法官的法庭命令而中止。当晚，三名来自北方的白人牧师——游行队伍中的三名成员——遭到三 K 党成员的袭击和棍棒殴打；其中一名受害者因伤势过重而死亡。电视上播放的抗议者遭受暴行和牧师死亡的画面，引发了公众对这项事业的更多同情。最终，第三次游行成功抵达州首府蒙哥马利。 44

1987 年 PBS 纪录片《 目光聚焦奖》 因其对民权运动重大事件的报道而荣获多项艾美奖和其他奖项，这些事件包括蒙哥马利巴士抵制运动、小石城学校种族融合之战、从塞尔玛到蒙哥马利的游行以及马丁·路德·金领导的向华盛顿特区进军。

The events at Selma galvanized support in Congress for a follow-up bill solely dealing with the right to vote. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 went beyond previous laws by requiring greater oversight of elections by federal officials. Literacy and understanding tests, and other devices used to discriminate against voters on the basis of race, were banned. The Voting Rights Act proved to have much more immediate and dramatic effect than the laws that preceded it; what had been a fairly slow process of improving voter registration and participation was replaced by a rapid increase of Black voter registration rates—although White registration rates increased over this period as well.45 To many people’s way of thinking, however, the Supreme Court turned back the clocks when it gutted a core aspect of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder (2013).46 No longer would states need federal approval to change laws and policies related to voting. Indeed, many states with a history of voter discrimination quickly resumed restrictive practices with laws requiring photo ID; limiting early voting, ballot drop-off locations, and hours; and making registering and waiting to vote more onerous. Some of the new restrictions are already being challenged in the courts.47
塞尔玛事件激发了国会对后续法案的支持，该法案专门针对投票权。1965 年的《投票权法案》超越了之前的法律，要求联邦官员对选举进行更严格的监督。该法案禁止了识字和理解能力测试以及其他基于种族歧视选民的手段。事实证明，《投票权法案》比之前的法律产生了更直接、更显著的影响；此前选民登记和参与率提升缓慢的过程被黑人选民登记率的快速增长所取代——尽管在此期间白人选民的登记率也有所提高。 然而 ，在许多人看来，最高法院在谢尔比县诉霍尔德案 （2013 年）中削弱了《投票权法案》的核心条款 ，这无异于开历史倒车。各州不再需要联邦政府的批准即可修改与投票相关的法律和政策。事实上，许多有着选民歧视历史的州迅速恢复了限制性做法，例如要求出示带照片的身份证件；限制提前投票、选票投递地点和时间；并增加选民登记和投票等待的繁琐程序。其中一些新限制措施已在法庭上受到挑战 。47

Not all African Americans in the civil rights movement were comfortable with gradual change. Instead of using marches and demonstrations to change people’s attitudes, calling for tougher civil rights laws, or suing for their rights in court, they favored more immediate action to prevent White oppression and protect their communities. Men like Malcolm X, and groups like the Black Panthers were willing to use other means to achieve their goals (Figure 5.9).48 Faced with continual violence at the hands of police and acts of terrorism like the bombing of a Black church in Alabama that killed four girls, Malcolm X expressed significant distrust of White people. He sought to raise the self-esteem of Black people and advocated for their separation from the United States through eventual emigration to Africa. In general, Malcolm X rejected the mainstream civil right's movement's integration and assimilation approach, and laid the foundation for the Black Power movement, which sought self-determination and independence for Black people. His position was attractive to many young African Americans, especially after Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated in 1968.

并非所有参与民权运动的非裔美国人都乐于接受渐进式的变革。他们没有选择通过游行示威来改变人们的态度，也没有呼吁制定更严格的民权法或通过诉讼来争取自身权益，而是倾向于采取更直接的行动来阻止白人的压迫并保护他们的社区。像马尔科姆·X 这样的人物，以及像黑豹党这样的组织，都愿意使用其他手段来实现他们的目标（ 图 5.9 ）。 48 面对警察的持续暴力以及诸如阿拉巴马州黑人教堂爆炸案（造成四名女孩丧生）等恐怖主义行为，马尔科姆·X 对白人表达了强烈的不信任。他致力于提升黑人的自尊，并倡导他们最终移民非洲，从而脱离美国。总的来说，马尔科姆·X 反对主流民权运动的融合和同化策略，并为黑人权力运动奠定了基础，该运动旨在争取黑人的自决和独立。他的立场对许多年轻的非裔美国人来说很有吸引力，尤其是在马丁·路德·金于 1968 年遇刺身亡之后。

CONTINUING CHALLENGES FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS
非裔美国人持续面临的挑战
The civil rights movement for African Americans did not end with the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965. For the last fifty years, the African American community has faced challenges related to both past and current discrimination, and progress on both fronts remains slow, uneven, and often frustrating.

[.my2]
非裔美国人的民权运动并没有随着 1965 年 《投票权法案》 的通过而结束。在过去的五十年里，非裔美国人社区一直面临着与过去和现在的歧视相关的挑战，而且在这两个方面取得的进展仍然缓慢、不均衡，并且常常令人沮丧。

Legacies of the de jure segregation of the past remain in much of the United States. Many Black people still live in predominantly Black neighborhoods where their ancestors were forced by laws and housing covenants to live.49 Even those who live in the suburbs, once largely populated only by White people, tend to live in suburbs that are mostly populated by Black people.50 Some two million African American young people attend schools whose student body is composed almost entirely of students of color.51 During the late 1960s and early 1970s, efforts to tackle these problems were stymied by large-scale public opposition, not just in the South but across the nation. Attempts to integrate public schools through the use of busing—transporting students from one segregated neighborhood to another to achieve more racially balanced schools—were particularly unpopular and helped contribute to “White flight” from cities to the suburbs.52 This White flight has created de facto segregation, a form of segregation that results from the choices of individuals to live in segregated communities without government action or support.

[.my2]
过去种族隔离的法律遗毒在美国大部分地区依然存在。许多黑人仍然居住在以黑人为主的社区，他们的祖先曾被迫因法律和住房契约而居住在这些社区。 49 即使是那些居住在郊区的人，这些郊区曾经几乎完全由白人组成，如今也往往居住在以黑人为主的郊区。 50 大约有两百万非裔美国青少年就读于几乎全部由有色人种学生组成的学校。 51 在 20 世纪 60 年代末和 70 年代初，解决这些问题的努力因大规模的公众反对而受阻，这种反对不仅发生在南方，而且遍及全国。通过校车接送——将学生从一个隔离的社区送到另一个隔离的社区以实现种族更加平衡的学校——来促进公立学校种族融合的尝试尤其不受欢迎，并加剧了白人从城市向郊区的“逃离”。 52 这种白人迁徙造成了事实上的种族隔离 ，这种种族隔离是由于个人选择居住在隔离的社区而没有政府的行动或支持而造成的。

Today, a lack of well-paying jobs in many urban areas, combined with the poverty resulting from the legacies of slavery, Jim Crow era terror, and persistent racism, has trapped many Black people in under-served neighborhoods with markedly lower opportunity and life expectancy.53 While the Civil Rights Act of 1964 created opportunities for members of the Black middle class to advance economically and socially, and to live in the same neighborhoods as the White middle class, their departure left many Black neighborhoods mired in poverty and without the strong community ties that existed during the era of legal segregation. Many of these neighborhoods continue to suffer from high rates of crime and violence.54 Police also appear, consciously or subconsciously, to engage in racial profiling: singling out Black people (and Latino people) for greater attention than members of other racial and ethnic groups, as former FBI director James B. Comey and former New York police commissioner Bill Bratton have admitted.55 When incidents of real or perceived injustice arise, as recently occurred after a series of deaths of Black people at the hands of police in Ferguson, Missouri; Staten Island, New York; Baltimore, Maryland; Louisville, Kentucky; and Minneapolis, Minnesota, many African Americans turn to the streets to protest because they feel abandoned or ignored by politicians of all races.

[.my2]
如今，许多城市地区缺乏高薪工作，加上奴隶制遗留问题、吉姆·克劳时代的恐怖统治以及持续存在的种族主义造成的贫困，使得许多黑人被困在服务不足的社区，这些社区的机会和预期寿命明显较低。 53 虽然 1964 年的 《民权法案》 为黑人中产阶级成员创造了经济和社会进步的机会，并使他们能够与白人中产阶级居住在相同的社区，但他们的离开使许多黑人社区陷入贫困，失去了在种族隔离时期存在的牢固的社区联系。许多这样的社区仍然饱受高犯罪率和暴力问题的困扰。 54 警察似乎也有意或无意地进行种族歧视：他们对黑人（和拉丁裔）给予比其他种族和族裔群体成员更多的关注，正如前联邦调查局局长詹姆斯·B·科米和前纽约市警察局长比尔·布拉顿所承认的那样。 55 当发生真实或感知到的不公正事件时，例如最近在密苏里州弗格森、纽约州斯塔滕岛、马里兰州巴尔的摩、肯塔基州路易斯维尔和明尼苏达州明尼阿波利斯发生的一系列黑人死于警察之手的事件，许多非裔美国人走上街头抗议，因为他们感到被各族裔的政客抛弃或忽视。

While the public mood may have shifted toward greater concern about economic inequality in the United States, substantial policy changes to immediately improve the economic standing of African Americans in general have not followed. The Obama administration proposed new rules under the Fair Housing Act that were intended to lead to more integrated communities in the future; however, the Trump administration repeatedly sought to weaken the Fair Housing Act, primarily through lack of enforcement of existing regulations.56 Meanwhile, grassroots movements to improve neighborhoods and local schools have taken root in many Black communities across America, and perhaps in those movements is the hope for greater future progress.

[.my2]
尽管公众情绪可能已转向更加关注美国的经济不平等问题，但旨在立即改善非裔美国人整体经济状况的实质性政策变革并未随之而来。奥巴马政府曾根据《公平住房法》提出新规，旨在促进未来社区的融合；然而，特朗普政府却屡次试图削弱《公平住房法》，主要手段是缺乏对现有法规的执行。与此同时，旨在改善社区和当地学校的基层运动已在美国许多黑人社区扎根，或许这些运动蕴藏着未来取得更大进步的希望。

Other recent movements are more troubling, notably the increased presence and influence of White nationalism throughout the country. This movement espouses White supremacy and does not shrink from the threat or use of violence to achieve it. Such violence occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017, when various White supremacist groups and alt-right forces joined together in a "Unite the Right" rally (Figure 5.10). This rally included chants and racial slurs against African Americans and Jews. Those rallying clashed with counter-protestors, one of whom died when an avowed Neo-Nazi deliberately drove his car into a group of peaceful protestors. He has since been convicted and sentenced to life in prison for his actions. This event sent shockwaves through U.S. politics, as leaders tried to grapple with the significance of the event. President Trump said that "you had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people who were very fine people on both sides."57
近期其他一些运动更令人担忧，尤其是白人至上主义在全国范围内日益增长的影响力。这一运动宣扬白人至上，并且毫不犹豫地使用暴力来实现这一目标。2017 年 8 月，弗吉尼亚州夏洛茨维尔市就发生了此类暴力事件。当时，多个白人至上主义团体和另类右翼势力联合举行了一场名为“团结右翼”的集会（ 图 5.10 ）。集会期间，参与者高喊口号，并对非裔美国人和犹太人进行种族歧视。集会者与反示威者发生冲突，一名自称新纳粹分子的男子故意驾车冲撞一群和平示威者，导致其中一人死亡。该男子已被定罪，并被判处终身监禁。这一事件在美国政坛引起轩然大波，各国领导人都在努力应对其影响。特朗普总统表示，“那群人里有一些非常坏的人，但双方也都有非常好的人。” 57

Finding a Middle Ground
寻找折衷方案
Affirmative Action  平权行动
One of the major controversies regarding race in the United States today is related to affirmative action, the practice of ensuring that members of historically disadvantaged or underrepresented groups have equal access to opportunities in education, the workplace, and government contracting. The phrase affirmative action originated in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 11246, and it has drawn controversy ever since. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited discrimination in employment, and Executive Order 11246, issued in 1965, forbade employment discrimination not only within the federal government but by federal contractors and contractors and subcontractors who received government funds.

[.my2]
当今美国种族问题上的主要争议之一与平权行动有关，平权行动旨在确保历史上处于弱势或代表性不足的群体成员在教育、就业和政府合同方面享有平等的机会。 平权行动一词源于 1964 年的《民权法案》和第 11246 号行政命令，此后一直备受争议。1964 年的《民权法案》禁止就业歧视，而 1965 年颁布的第 11246 号行政命令不仅禁止联邦政府内部的就业歧视，还禁止接受政府资金的联邦承包商、承包商和分包商的就业歧视。

Clearly, Black people, as well as other groups, have been subject to discrimination in the past and present, limiting their opportunity to compete on a level playing field with those who face no such challenge. Opponents of affirmative action, however, point out that many of its beneficiaries are ethnic minorities from relatively affluent backgrounds, while White and Asian Americans who grew up in poverty are expected to succeed despite facing challenges related to their socioeconomic status and those related to educational issues in lower income areas.

[.my2]
显然，黑人以及其他族裔群体在过去和现在都遭受过歧视，这限制了他们与那些没有面临此类挑战的人在公平竞争环境中竞争的机会。然而，平权行动的反对者指出，许多受益者是来自相对富裕家庭的少数族裔，而那些在贫困中长大的白人和亚裔美国人却被期望在面临与其社会经济地位和低收入地区教育问题相关的挑战时也能取得成功。

Because affirmative action attempts to redress discrimination on the basis of race or ethnicity, it is generally subject to the strict scrutiny standard, which means the burden of proof is on the government to demonstrate the necessity of racial discrimination to achieve a compelling governmental interest. In 1978, in Bakke v. California, the Supreme Court upheld affirmative action and said that colleges and universities could consider race when deciding whom to admit but could not establish racial quotas.58 In 2003, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the Bakke decision in Grutter v. Bollinger, which said that taking race or ethnicity into account as one of several factors in admitting a student to a college or university was acceptable, but a system setting aside seats for a specific quota of minority students was not.59 All these issues are back under discussion in the Supreme Court with the re-arguing of Fisher v. University of Texas.60 In Fisher v. University of Texas (2013, known as Fisher I), University of Texas student Abigail Fisher brought suit to declare UT’s race-based admissions policy as inconsistent with Grutter. The court did not see the UT policy that way and allowed it, so long as it remained narrowly tailored and not quota-based. Fisher II (2016) was decided by a 4–3 majority. It allowed race-based admissions, but required that the utility of such an approach had to be re-established on a regular basis.

[.my2]
由于平权行动旨在纠正基于种族或族裔的歧视，因此通常适用严格审查标准，这意味着政府有责任证明种族歧视对于实现令人信服的政府利益是必要的。1978 年，在 “巴克诉加利福尼亚州案”（Bakke v. California） 中，最高法院支持了平权行动，并裁定高校在录取学生时可以考虑种族因素，但不得设立种族配额。 58 2003 年，最高法院在“格鲁特诉博林格案” （Grutter v. Bollinger） 中重申了“巴克案”的判决，认为在录取学生时，将种族或族裔作为若干因素之一进行考虑是可以接受的，但为特定少数族裔学生预留名额的制度是不可接受的。 59 随着“费舍尔诉德克萨斯大学案”（ Fisher v. University of Texas） 的重新审理，所有这些问题再次成为最高法院讨论的焦点。 60 在费舍尔诉德克萨斯大学案 （2013 年，简称 “费舍尔案一” ）中，德克萨斯大学学生阿比盖尔·费舍尔提起诉讼，要求宣布德克萨斯大学基于种族的招生政策与格鲁特案的判例相悖。法院并未认同这一观点，并允许该政策继续有效，前提是该政策必须具有针对性，且不得采用配额制。 费舍尔案二 （2016 年）以 4 比 3 的多数票裁定，允许基于种族的招生政策，但要求必须定期重新评估这种做法的有效性。

However, in Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. Harvard (and the companion SFFA v. University of North Carolina), fully 6 justices voted to declare that affirmative action in college admissions is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment61
