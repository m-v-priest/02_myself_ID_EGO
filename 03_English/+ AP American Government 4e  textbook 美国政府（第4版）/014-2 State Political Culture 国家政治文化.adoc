== 释义




Some states, such as Alaska, are endowed with natural resources. They can use their oil or natural gas reserves to their advantage to fund education or reduce taxes. Other states, like Florida, are favored with a climate that attracts tourists and retirees each winter, drawing in revenues to support infrastructure improvements throughout the state. These differences can lead to strategic advantages in the economic fortunes of a state, which can translate into differences in the levels of taxes that must be collected from citizens.

有些州，例如阿拉斯加州，拥有丰富的自然资源。它们可以利用石油或天然气储备来资助教育或降低税收。另​​一些州，例如佛罗里达州，则拥有宜人的气候，每年冬天吸引大量游客和退休人员，从而带来可观的收入，用于改善全州的基础设施。这些差异会给各州的经济发展带来战略优势，进而影响到各州需要向公民征收的税额。

But their economic fortunes are only one component of what makes individual states unique. Theorists have long proposed that states are also unique as a function of their differing political cultures, or their attitudes and beliefs about the functions and expectations of the government. In the book, American Federalism: A View from the States, Daniel Elazar first theorized in 1966 that the United States could be divided into three distinct political cultures: moralistic, individualistic, and traditionalistic (Figure 14.7). The diffusion of these cultures throughout the United States is attributed to the migratory patterns of immigrants who settled in and spread out across the country from the east to the west coast. These settlers had distinct political and religious values that influenced their beliefs about the proper role of government, the need for citizen involvement in the democratic process, and the role of political parties.

[.my2]
但经济状况只是构成各州独特性的一个因素。理论家们长期以来一直认为，各州的独特性还体现在其不同的政治文化上，即他们对政府职能和期望的态度和信念。丹尼尔 ·埃拉扎尔在其著作《 美国联邦制：来自各州的视角》 中，于 1966 年首次提出，美国可以分为三种截然不同的政治文化：道德主义、个人主义和传统主义（ 图 14.7 ）。这些文化在美国的传播归因于移民的迁徙模式，他们从东海岸到西海岸定居并扩散到全国各地。这些移民拥有独特的政治和宗教价值观，这些价值观影响了他们对政府的恰当角色、公民参与民主进程的必要性以及政党作用的看法。

A map of the United States titled “Elazar’s Cultural Classification by State”. States marked as “Individualistic” are Nevada, Wyoming, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, DC, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New York, Alaska, and Hawaii. States marked as “Moralistic” are California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. States marked as “Traditionalistic” are Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia.

[.my2]
Figure 14.7 Daniel Elazar posited that the United States can be divided geographically into three types of political cultures—individualistic, moralistic, and traditionalistic—which spread with the migratory patterns of immigrants across the country.

[.my2]
图 14.7 丹尼尔·埃拉扎尔提出，美国可以从地理上划分为三种政治文化类型——个人主义、道德主义和传统主义——这些文化随着移民在全国的迁徙模式而传播开来。
MORALISTIC POLITICAL CULTURE
道德主义政治文化
In Elazar’s framework, states with a moralistic political culture see the government as a means to better society and promote the general welfare. They expect political officials to be honest in their dealings with others, put the interests of the people they serve above their own, and commit to improving the area they represent. The political process is seen in a positive light and not as a vehicle tainted by corruption. In fact, citizens in moralistic cultures have little patience for corruption and believe that politicians should be motivated by a desire to benefit the community rather than by a need to profit financially from service.

[.my2]
在埃拉扎尔的框架下，具有道德主义政治文化的国家将政府视为改善社会、促进公共福祉的工具。他们期望政治官员在与他人交往时诚实守信，将人民的利益置于自身利益之上，并致力于改善其所代表的地区。政治进程被视为积极的，而非充斥着腐败的工具。事实上，在道德主义文化中，公民对腐败零容忍，他们认为政治家的动机应该是造福社会，而不是从服务中谋取经济利益。

Moralistic states thus tend to support an expanded role for government. They are more likely to believe government should promote the general welfare by allocating funds to programs that will benefit the poor. In addition, they see it as the duty of public officials to advocate for new programs that will benefit marginal citizens or solve public policy problems, even when public pressure to do so is nonexistent.

[.my2]
因此，道德主义国家往往支持扩大政府职能。它们更倾向于认为政府应该通过拨款资助惠及穷人的项目来促进公共福祉。此外，它们认为，即使没有公众压力，公职人员也有责任倡导有利于弱势群体或解决公共政策问题的新项目。

The moralistic political culture developed among the Puritans in upper New England. After several generations, these settlers moved westward, and their values diffused across the top of the United States to the upper Great Lakes. In the middle of the 1800s, Scandinavians and Northern Europeans joined this group of settlers and reinforced the Puritans’ values. Together, these groups pushed further west through the northern portion of the Midwest and West and then along the West Coast.19
新英格兰北部清教徒中发展出一种道德主义的政治文化。几代人之后，这些定居者向西迁徙，他们的价值观也传播到美国北部，直至五大湖区上游。19 世纪中期，斯堪的纳维亚人和北欧人加入到这群定居者中，进一步强化了清教徒的价值观。这些群体共同向西推进，穿过中西部北部和西部地区，然后沿着西海岸继续扩张 。19

States that identify with this culture value citizen engagement and desire citizen participation in all forms of political affairs. In Elazar’s model, citizens from moralistic states should be more likely to donate their time and/or resources to political campaigns and to vote. This occurs for two main reasons. First, state law is likely to make it easier for residents to register and to vote because mass participation is valued. Second, citizens who hail from moralistic states should be more likely to vote because elections are truly contested. In other words, candidates will be less likely to run unopposed and more likely to face genuine competition from a qualified opponent. According to Elazar, the heightened competition is a function of individuals’ believing that public service is a worthwhile endeavor and an honorable profession.

[.my2]
认同这种文化的国家重视公民参与，并渴望公民参与各种形式的政治事务。在埃拉扎尔的模型中，来自道德至上国家的公民更有可能将时间和/或资源投入政治竞选活动并参与投票。这主要有两个原因。首先，由于民众参与受到重视，这些国家的法律可能会简化居民的选民登记和投票流程。其次，来自道德至上国家的公民更有可能参与投票，因为这些国家的选举竞争更加激烈。换句话说，候选人不太可能无人挑战，而更有可能面临来自实力相当的对手的真正竞争。埃拉扎尔认为，这种激烈的竞争源于个人相信公共服务是一项有价值的事业和一项光荣的职业。

Milestone  里程碑
Oregon’s Efforts to Expand the Voting Franchise
俄勒冈州扩大投票权的努力
In 1998, Oregon became the first state to switch to mail-in voting when citizens passed a ballot measure for it to take effect. In March 2015, Governor Kate Brown took another step to expand the voting franchise. She signed a bill into law that makes voter registration automatic for all citizens in the state with a driver’s license.

[.my2]
1998 年，俄勒冈州成为美国第一个实行邮寄投票的州，当时公民投票通过了一项相关提案。2015 年 3 月，州长凯特· 布朗采取了进一步扩大投票权的措施。她签署了一项法案，规定所有持有驾照的州内公民都将自动进行选民登记。

Since that time, citizens have been automatically registered to vote in elections and receive a mail-in ballot before Election Day unless they specifically opt out with the Oregon secretary of state’s office.20 Implementation of the bill led to 225,000 residents being added to the state voter participation list at the start of 2016. Among those, nearly 100,000, or approximately 43 percent, voted in the 2016 election.21
自那时起，除非公民向俄勒冈州州务卿办公室明确选择退出，否则他们将被自动登记参加选举，并在选举日之前收到邮寄选票。 20 该法案的实施导致 2016 年初有 22.5 万居民被添加到州选民登记册中。其中，近 10 万人，约占 43%，参加了 2016 年的选举投票。 21

However, the new law lacked the support of Republicans in the state legislature. Similar to the logic used by many state legislative initiatives across the nation in 2020, these party members believed automatic registration makes the voting process too easy for citizens and coerces them into voting.22 Others argued that Oregon’s new law is a positive move. They believe the change was a step in the right direction for democracy and encouraged participation in elections. If Oregon’s law were to be adopted across the United States, it would affect about fifty million citizens, the number who are believed to be eligible to vote but who remain unregistered.23
然而，这项新法律并未获得州议会共和党人的支持。与 2020 年全国许多州立法提案的逻辑类似，这些共和党成员认为自动登记使公民投票过程过于简单，并强迫他们投票。 22 另一些人则认为俄勒冈州的新法律是一项积极的举措。他们认为这一改变是民主朝着正确方向迈出的一步，并鼓励了民众参与选举。如果俄勒冈州的法律在美国全国范围内推广，将影响约五千万公民，这些人被认为有资格投票但尚未登记。 23

What are the benefits of Oregon’s automatic voter registration policy? Are there any drawbacks? What advantages and disadvantages might arise if this policy were adopted nationwide?
俄勒冈州的自动选民登记政策有哪些好处？有哪些缺点？如果这项政策在全国范围内推广，可能会产生哪些利弊？

Finally, in Elazar’s view, citizens in moralistic cultures are more likely to support individuals who earn their positions in government on merit rather than as a reward for party loyalty. In theory, there is less incentive to be corrupt if people acquire positions based on their qualifications. In addition, moralistic cultures are more open to third-party participation. Voters want to see political candidates compete who are motivated by the prospect of supporting the broader community, regardless of their party identification.

[.my2]
最后，埃拉扎尔认为，在道德至上的文化中，公民更倾向于支持那些凭借自身能力而非党派忠诚而获得政府职位的人。理论上讲，如果人们凭借自身能力获得职位，那么他们腐败的动机就会减少。此外，道德至上的文化也更乐于接受第三方参与。选民希望看到那些以服务更广泛的社会为目标的政治候选人参与竞争，而不受党派归属的限制。

INDIVIDUALISTIC POLITICAL CULTURE
个人主义政治文化
States that align with Elazar’s individualistic political culture see the government as a mechanism for addressing issues that matter to individual citizens and for pursuing individual goals. People in this culture interact with the government in the same manner they would interact with a marketplace. They expect the government to provide goods and services they see as essential, and the public officials and bureaucrats who provide them expect to be compensated for their efforts. The focus is on meeting individual needs and private goals rather than on serving the best interests of everyone in the community. New policies will be enacted if politicians can use them to garner support from voters or other interested stakeholders, or if there is great demand for these services on the part of individuals.

[.my2]
与埃拉扎尔的个人主义政治文化相符的国家将政府视为解决公民个人关心的问题和追求个人目标的机制。在这种文化中，人们与政府的互动方式与在市场上的互动方式相同。他们期望政府提供他们认为必不可少的商品和服务，而提供这些商品和服务的公职人员则期望获得相应的报酬。这种文化关注的是满足个人需求和私人目标，而不是服务于社区中所有人的最佳利益。如果政治家能够利用新政策赢得选民或其他利益相关者的支持，或者如果个人对这些服务有巨大的需求，那么新政策就会被颁布实施。

According to Elazar, the individualist political culture originated with settlers from non-Puritan England and Germany. The first settlements were in the mid-Atlantic region of New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey and diffused into the middle portion of the United States in a fairly straight line from Ohio to Wyoming.

[.my2]
埃拉扎尔认为，个人主义政治文化起源于来自非清教徒的英国和德国移民。最初的定居点位于纽约、宾夕法尼亚和新泽西等大西洋中部地区，并沿着一条从俄亥俄州到怀俄明州的大致直线扩散到美国中部地区。

Given their focus on pursuing individual objectives, states with an individualistic mindset will tend to advance tax breaks as a way of trying to boost a state’s economy or as a mechanism for promoting individual initiative and entrepreneurship. For instance, New Jersey governor Chris Christie made headlines in 2015 when discussing the incentives he used to attract businesses to the state. Christie encouraged a number of businesses to move to Camden, where unemployment has risen to almost 14 percent, by providing them with hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks.24 The governor hopes these corporate incentives will spur job creation for citizens who need employment in an economically depressed area of the state. Another approach to fuel growth is to provide incentives for individuals to relocate to the community. For example, in the hope of attracting employees who telecommute for their jobs, Tulsa Remote offers people $10,000 if they relocate to Tulsa, which they can use for a down payment on a home.25
鉴于各州注重追求个人目标，奉行个人主义思维的州往往会通过减税来刺激经济，或以此作为促进个人进取和创业的手段。例如，新泽西州州长克里斯· 克里斯蒂在 2015 年因讨论其吸引企业落户该州的激励措施而成为新闻焦点。克里斯蒂通过提供数亿美元的税收减免，鼓励多家企业迁往失业率已接近 14%的卡姆登市。 24 州长希望这些企业激励措施能够为该州经济萧条地区需要就业的居民创造就业机会。另一种促进经济增长的方法是为迁居社区的个人提供激励措施。例如，为了吸引远程办公人员，塔尔萨远程办公项目向迁居塔尔萨的人员提供 1 万美元的补贴，可用于支付房屋首付。 25

Since this theoretical lens assumes that the objective of politics and the government is to advance individual interests, Elazar argues that individuals are motivated to become engaged in politics only if they have a personal interest in this area or wish to be in charge of the provision of government benefits. They will tend to remain involved if they get enjoyment from their participation or rewards in the form of patronage appointments or financial compensation. As a result of these personal motivations, citizens in individualistic states will tend to be more tolerant of corruption among their political leaders and less likely to see politics as a noble profession in which all citizens should engage.

[.my2]
由于这种理论视角假定政治和政府的目标是增进个人利益，埃拉扎尔认为，只有当个人对政治领域有切身利益，或希望掌控政府福利的提供时，他们才会积极参与政治。如果他们能从参与政治中获得乐趣，或以庇护任命或经济补偿的形式获得回报，他们往往会继续参与其中。由于这些个人动机，个人主义国家的公民往往对政治领导人的腐败行为更加宽容，也更难将政治视为所有公民都应参与的崇高职业。

Finally, Elazar argues that in individualistic states, electoral competition does not seek to identify the candidate with the best ideas. Instead it pits against each other political parties that are well organized and compete directly for votes. Voters are loyal to the candidates who hold the same party affiliation they do. As a result, unlike the case in moralistic cultures, voters do not pay much attention to the personalities of the candidates when deciding how to vote and are less tolerant of third-party candidates.

[.my2]
最后，埃拉扎尔认为，在个人主义国家，选举竞争并非旨在选出理念最佳的候选人，而是让组织良好的政党之间直接竞争选票。选民忠于与自己属于同一政党的候选人。因此，与道德主义文化不同，选民在决定投票时不太关注候选人的个人魅力，对第三方候选人的容忍度也更低。

TRADITIONALISTIC POLITICAL CULTURE
传统政治文化
Given the prominence of slavery in its formation, a traditionalistic political culture, in Elazar’s argument, sees the government as necessary to maintaining the existing social order, the status quo. Only elites belong in the political enterprise, and as a result, new public policies will be advanced only if they reinforce the beliefs and interests of those in power.

[.my2]
鉴于奴隶制在其形成过程中扮演的重要角色，埃拉扎尔认为， 传统主义政治文化将政府视为维护现有社会秩序和现状的必要手段。只有精英阶层才有资格参与政治活动，因此，只有当新的公共政策能够强化当权者的信念和利益时，这些政策才能得以推行。

Elazar associates traditionalistic political culture with the southern portion of the United States, where it developed in the upper regions of Virginia and Kentucky before spreading to the Deep South and the Southwest. Like the individualistic culture, the traditionalistic culture believes in the importance of the individual. But instead of profiting from corporate ventures, settlers in traditionalistic states tied their economic fortunes to the necessity of slavery on plantations throughout the South.

[.my2]
埃拉扎尔认为传统主义政治文化与美国南部地区密切相关，这种文化起源于弗吉尼亚州和肯塔基州的北部地区，之后传播到南部腹地和西南部。与个人主义文化一样，传统主义文化也重视个人。但与从企业活动中获利不同，传统主义州的定居者将他们的经济命运与南方各地种植园的奴隶制紧密联系在一起。

When elected officials do not prioritize public policies that benefit them, those on the social and economic fringes of society can be plagued by poverty and pervasive health problems. For example, although Figure 14.8 shows that poverty is a problem across the entire United States, the South has the highest incidence. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the South also leads the nation in self-reported obesity, closely followed by the Midwest.26 These statistics present challenges for lawmakers not only in the short term but also in the long term, because they must prioritize fiscal constraints in the face of growing demand for services.

[.my2]
当民选官员不优先考虑有利于自身利益的公共政策时，处于社会和经济边缘的人群可能会饱受贫困和普遍存在的健康问题的困扰。例如，尽管图 14.8 显示贫困问题遍及全美，但南部地区的贫困率最高。根据美国疾病控制与预防中心的数据，南部地区的自我报告肥胖率也位居全国之首，紧随其后的是中西部地区。 26 这些统计数据不仅给立法者带来了短期挑战，也带来了长期挑战，因为他们必须在不断增长的服务需求面前，优先考虑财政限制。

A map of the United States titled “America’s Poor by Region”. Four regions are marked on the map; “West” covers Alaska, Hawaii, California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico, “Midwest” covers North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Montana, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, “South” covers “Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and DC, and “Northeast” covers Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine, Vermont, and New York. A legend to the right of the map is labeled “% of U. S. population below poverty line”. For “South” it reads “15.3% in 1973 and 12.4% in 2023. For “Northeast” it reads 8.6% in 1973 9.8% in 2023”. For “Midwest” it reads 1973 8.6%; 2023 9.8%. For “West” it reads “1973 10.5%; 2023 11.0%”.

While moralistic cultures expect and encourage political participation by all citizens, traditionalistic cultures are more likely to see it as a privilege reserved for only those who meet the qualifications. As a result, voter participation will generally be lower in a traditionalistic culture, and there will be more barriers to participation (e.g., a requirement to produce a photo ID at the voting booth). Conservatives argue that these laws reduce or eliminate fraud on the part of voters, while liberals believe they disproportionally disenfranchise the poor and minorities and constitute a modern-day poll tax.

[.my2]
道德主义文化期望并鼓励所有公民参与政治，而传统主义文化则更倾向于将其视为一种特权，仅限于符合特定条件的人。因此，在传统主义文化中，选民参与率通常较低，且参与门槛更高（例如，投票时需要出示带照片的身份证件）。保守派认为这些法律可以减少或消除选民舞弊，而自由派则认为这些法律不成比例地剥夺了穷人和少数族裔的选举权，构成了一种现代版的“人头税”。

Finally, under a traditionalistic political culture, Elazar argues that party competition will tend to occur between factions within a dominant party. Historically, the Democratic Party dominated the political structure in the South before realignment during the civil rights era. Today, depending on the office being sought, the parties are more likely to compete for voters.

[.my2]
最后，埃拉扎尔认为，在传统的政治文化下，党内竞争往往发生在主导政党内部的不同派系之间。历史上，民主党在南方政治结构中占据主导地位，直到民权运动时期才发生重组。如今，根据竞选职位的不同，各党派更有可能争夺选民。

CRITIQUES OF ELAZAR’S THEORY
对埃拉扎尔理论的批判
Several critiques have come to light since Elazar first introduced his theory of state political culture fifty years ago. The original theory rested on the assumption that new cultures could arise with the influx of settlers from different parts of the world; however, since immigration patterns have changed over time, it could be argued that the three cultures no longer match the country’s current reality. Today’s immigrants are less likely to come from European countries and are more likely to originate in Latin American and Asian countries.27 In addition, advances in technology and transportation have made it easier for citizens to travel across state lines and to relocate. Therefore, the pattern of diffusion on which the original theory rests may no longer be accurate, because people are moving around in more, and often unpredictable, directions.

[.my2]
自埃拉扎尔五十年前首次提出国家政治文化理论以来，已有诸多批评之声涌现。该理论最初基于这样的假设：随着来自世界各地的移民涌入，新的文化会随之产生； 然而 ，由于移民模式随时间推移而发生变化，有人认为，这三种文化已不再符合该国当前的实际情况。如今的移民不太可能来自欧洲国家，而更有可能来自拉丁美洲和亚洲国家。此外，科技和交通的进步使得公民更容易跨州旅行和迁徙。因此，最初理论所依赖的扩散模式可能不再准确，因为人们的流动方向更加多样化，也更难以预测。

It is also true that people migrate for more reasons than simple economics. They may be motivated by social issues such as widespread unemployment, urban decay, or low-quality health care or schools. Such trends may aggravate existing differences, for example the difference between urban and rural lifestyles (e.g., the city of Atlanta vs. other parts of Georgia), which are not accounted for in Elazar’s classification. Finally, unlike economic or demographic characteristics that lend themselves to more precise measurement, culture is a comprehensive concept that can be difficult to quantify. This can limit its explanatory power in political science research.

[.my2]
人们迁移的原因远不止经济因素。社会问题，例如普遍的失业、城市衰败或低质量的医疗保健和教育，也可能促使他们迁徙。这些趋势可能会加剧现有的差异，例如城乡生活方式的差异（例如，亚特兰大市与佐治亚州其他地区），而埃拉扎尔的分类并未考虑到这些差异。最后，与易于精确衡量的经济或人口特征不同，文化是一个难以量化的综合概念。这可能会限制其在政治学研究中的解释力。
