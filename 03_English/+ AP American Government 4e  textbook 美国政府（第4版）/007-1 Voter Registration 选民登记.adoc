== 释义





Before most voters are allowed to cast a ballot, they must register to vote in their state. This process may be as simple as checking a box on a driver’s license application or as difficult as filling out a long form with complicated questions. Registration allows governments to determine which citizens are allowed to vote and, in some cases, from which list of candidates they may select a party nominee. Ironically, while government wants to increase voter turnout, the registration process may prevent various groups of citizens and non-citizens from participating in the electoral process.

大多数选民在获得投票权之前，必须在所在州进行选民登记。登记过程可能很简单，只需在驾照申请表上勾选一个方框；也可能很复杂，需要填写一份包含复杂问题的长篇表格。选民登记制度使政府能够确定哪些公民拥有投票权，在某些情况下，还能决定政党可以从哪些候选人名单中选出提名人。具有讽刺意味的是，尽管政府希望提高投票率，但选民登记制度却可能阻碍某些公民和非公民群体参与选举。

VOTER REGISTRATION ACROSS THE UNITED STATES
美国各地的选民登记
Elections are state-by-state contests. They include general elections for president and statewide offices (e.g., governor and U.S. senator), and they are often organized and paid for by the states. Because political cultures vary from state to state, the process of voter registration similarly varies. For example, suppose an 85-year-old retiree with an expired driver’s license wants to register to vote. He or she might be able to register quickly in California or Florida, but a current government ID might be required prior to registration in Texas or Indiana.

[.my2]
选举是各州各自进行的竞争。选举包括总统普选和州级公职选举（例如州长和联邦参议员），通常由各州组织和承担费用。由于各州的政治文化各不相同， 选民登记流程也因此有所不同。例如，假设一位 85 岁的退休人员，驾照已过期，想要登记投票。在加利福尼亚州或佛罗里达州，他/她可能可以很快完成登记，但在德克萨斯州或印第安纳州，则可能需要先出示有效的政府颁发的身份证明文件才能进行登记。

The varied registration and voting laws across the United States have long caused controversy. In the aftermath of the Civil War, southern states enacted literacy tests, grandfather clauses, and other requirements intended to disenfranchise Black voters in Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi. Literacy tests were long and detailed exams on local and national politics, history, and more. They were often administered arbitrarily with more African Americans required to take them than White people.2 Poll taxes required voters to pay a fee to vote. Grandfather clauses exempted individuals from taking literacy tests or paying poll taxes if they or their fathers or grandfathers had been permitted to vote prior to a certain point in time. While the Supreme Court determined that grandfather clauses were unconstitutional in 1915, states continued to use poll taxes and literacy tests to deter potential voters from registering.3 States also ignored instances of violence and intimidation against African Americans wanting to register or vote.4
美国各地不同的选民登记和投票法长期以来引发争议。内战结束后，南方各州颁布了文化程度测试 、 祖父条款和其他旨在剥夺阿拉巴马州、佐治亚州和密西西比州黑人选民投票权的规定。文化程度测试是对地方和国家政治、历史等内容的冗长而详细的考试。这些测试往往随意进行，非裔美国人被要求参加测试的人数远多于白人。 2 人头税要求选民缴纳费用才能投票。祖父条款规定，如果个人或其父辈或祖辈在特定时间点之前获得过投票权，则可免于参加文化程度测试或缴纳人头税 。尽管最高法院在 1915 年裁定祖父条款违宪，但各州仍然继续使用人头税和文化程度测试来阻止潜在选民登记。 3 各州还对针对希望登记或投票的非裔美国人的暴力和恐吓事件置之不理。 4

The ratification of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment in 1964 ended poll taxes, but the passage of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) in 1965 had a more profound effect (Figure 7.2). The act protected the rights of minority voters by prohibiting state laws that denied voting rights based on race. The VRA gave the attorney general of the United States authority to order federal examiners to areas with a history of discrimination. These examiners had the power to oversee and monitor voter registration and elections. States found to violate provisions of the VRA were required to get any changes in their election laws approved by the U.S. attorney general or by going through the court system. However, in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision, threw out the standards and process of the VRA, effectively gutting the landmark legislation.5 This decision effectively pushed decision-making and discretion for election policy in VRA states to the state and local level. Several such states subsequently made changes to their voter ID laws and North Carolina changed its plans for how many polling places were available in certain areas. This is the legal avenue though which legislators in scores of U.S. states in 2021 have introduced legislation to make voter registration requirements more stringent and to limit options in terms of voting methods. The extent to which such changes will violate equal protection is unknown in advance, but such changes often do not have a neutral effect.

[.my2]
1964 年第二十四修正案的批准废除了人头税，但 1965 年《 投票权法案 》（VRA）的通过产生了更为深远的影响（ 图 7.2 ）。该法案通过禁止各州基于种族剥夺少数族裔投票权的法律，保护了少数族裔选民的权利。VRA 赋予美国司法部长权力，可以命令联邦审查员前往存在歧视历史的地区。这些审查员有权监督和监测选民登记和选举。被认定违反 VRA 规定的州，必须获得美国司法部长的批准或通过法院系统才能对其选举法进行任何修改。然而，在 2013 年的“谢尔比县诉霍尔德案”（ Shelby County v. Holder ）中，最高法院以 5 比 4 的投票结果推翻了 VRA 的标准和程序，实际上削弱了这项具有里程碑意义的立法。 5 这一裁决实际上将 VRA 各州的选举政策决策权和自由裁量权下放至州和地方层面。随后，一些州修改了选民身份法，北卡罗来纳州也调整了部分地区的投票站数量。2021 年，美国数十个州的立法者正是通过这一法律途径，提出了旨在加强选民登记要求并限制投票方式的立法提案。此类修改在多大程度上会违反平等保护原则尚不可知，但此类修改往往不会产生中立的影响。

The effects of the VRA were visible almost immediately. In Mississippi, only 6.7 percent of Black people were registered to vote in 1965; however, by the fall of 1967, nearly 60 percent were registered. Alabama experienced similar effects, with African American registration increasing from 19.3 percent to 51.6 percent. Voter turnout across these two states similarly increased. Mississippi went from 33.9 percent turnout to 53.2 percent, while Alabama increased from 35.9 percent to 52.7 percent between the 1964 and 1968 presidential elections.6
《投票权法案》的影响几乎立竿见影。1965 年，密西西比州只有 6.7%的黑人登记投票；然而，到 1967 年秋季，这一比例接近 60%。阿拉巴马州也出现了类似的情况，非裔美国人的登记率从 19.3%上升到 51.6%。这两个州的投票率也同样上升。在 1964 年至 1968 年总统选举期间，密西西比州的投票率从 33.9%上升到 53.2%，而阿拉巴马州的投票率则从 35.9%上升到 52.7% 。

Following the implementation of the VRA, many states have sought other methods of increasing voter registration. Several states make registering to vote relatively easy for citizens who have government documentation. Oregon has few requirements for registering and registers many of its voters automatically. North Dakota has no registration at all. In 2002, Arizona was the first state to offer online voter registration, which allowed citizens with a driver’s license to register to vote without any paper application or signature. The system matches the information on the application to information stored at the Department of Motor Vehicles, to ensure each citizen is registering to vote in the right precinct. Citizens without a driver’s license still need to file a paper application. More than eighteen states have moved to online registration or passed laws to begin doing so. The National Conference of State Legislatures estimates, however, that adopting an online voter registration system can initially cost a state between $250,000 and $750,000.7
《投票权法案》（VRA）实施后，许多州寻求其他方法来提高选民登记率。一些州简化了持有政府颁发证件的公民的选民登记流程。俄勒冈州的登记要求很少，并且自动为许多选民进行登记。北达科他州则完全没有选民登记制度。2002 年，亚利桑那州率先推出在线选民登记服务，允许持有驾照的公民无需纸质申请或签名即可进行登记。该系统会将申请表上的信息与机动车辆管理局存储的信息进行匹配，以确保每位公民都在正确的选区进行登记。没有驾照的公民仍然需要提交纸质申请。目前已有超过 18 个州开始实行在线登记或已通过相关法律开始实施 。 然而，全国州议会联合会估计，采用在线选民登记系统初期可能需要一个州花费 25 万至 75 万美元。

Other states have decided against online registration due to concerns about voter fraud and security. Legislators also argue that online registration makes it difficult to ensure that only citizens are registering and that they are registering in the correct precincts. As technology continues to update other areas of state recordkeeping, online registration may become easier and safer. In some areas, citizens have pressured the states and pushed the process along. A bill to move registration online in Florida stalled for over a year in the legislature, based on security concerns. With strong citizen support, however, it was passed and signed in 2015, despite the governor’s lingering concerns. In other states, such as Texas, both the government and citizens are concerned about identity fraud, so traditional paper registration is still preferred.

[.my2]
其他一些州由于担心选民欺诈和安全问题，决定不采用网上选民登记。立法者也认为，网上登记难以确保只有公民本人登记，也难以确保他们在正确的选区登记。随着技术不断更新各州记录保存的其他方面，网上登记可能会变得更加便捷安全。在一些地区，公民向州政府施压，推动了这一进程。佛罗里达州一项旨在将选民登记改为网上登记的法案，由于安全方面的担忧，在州议会搁置了一年多。然而，在公民的大力支持下，尽管州长仍然心存疑虑，该法案最终还是在2015年获得通过并签署生效。在德克萨斯州等其他一些州，政府和公民都担心身份盗窃，因此传统的纸质登记方式仍然更受欢迎。

HOW DOES SOMEONE REGISTER TO VOTE?
如何进行选民登记？
The National Commission on Voting Rights completed a study in September 2015 that found state registration laws can either raise or reduce voter turnout rates, especially among citizens who are young or whose income falls below the poverty line. States with simple voter registration had more registered citizens.8
全国投票权委员会于 2015 年 9 月完成的一项研究发现，各州的选民登记法可能会提高或降低投票率，尤其是在年轻公民或收入低于贫困线的公民中。选民登记制度简单的州，登记选民人数更多 。8

In all states except North Dakota, a citizen wishing to vote must complete an application. Whether the form is online or on paper, the prospective voters will list their name, residency address, and in many cases party identification (with Independent as an option) and affirm that they are competent to vote. States may also have a residency requirement, which establishes how long a citizen must live in a state before becoming eligible to register: it is often thirty days. Beyond these requirements, there may be an oath administered or more questions asked, such as felony convictions. If the application is completely online and the citizen has government documents (e.g., driver’s license or state identification card), the system will compare the application to other state records and accept an online signature or affidavit if everything matches up correctly. Citizens who do not have these state documents are often required to complete paper applications. States without online registration often allow a citizen to fill out an application on a website, but the citizen will receive a paper copy in the mail to sign and mail back to the state.

[.my2]
除北达科他州外，所有州都要求公民填写申请表才能投票。无论申请表是线上填写还是纸质填写，准选民都需要填写姓名、居住地址，以及在许多情况下需要填写的党派信息（可以选择独立人士），并确认自己具备投票资格。各州可能还设有居住要求 ，规定公民必须在该州居住多长时间才能获得选民登记资格：通常为 30 天。除了这些要求外，可能还需要宣誓或回答其他问题，例如是否有重罪记录。如果申请完全在线完成，且公民持有政府文件（例如驾照或州身份证），系统会将申请表与州政府记录进行比对，如果信息完全匹配，则会接受在线签名或宣誓书。没有这些州政府文件的公民通常需要填写纸质申请表。没有在线登记的州通常允许公民在网站上填写申请表，但公民会收到邮寄的纸质申请表，需要签名后寄回州政府。

Another aspect of registering to vote is the timeline. States may require registration to take place as much as thirty days before voting, or they may allow same-day registration. Maine first implemented same-day registration in 1973. Fourteen states and the District of Columbia now allow voters to register the day of the election if they have proof of residency, such as a driver’s license or utility bill. Many of the more populous states (e.g., Michigan and Texas), require registration forms to be mailed thirty days before an election. Moving means citizens must re-register or update addresses (Figure 7.3). College students, for example, may have to re-register or update addresses each year as they move. States that use same-day registration had a 4 percent higher voter turnout in the 2012 presidential election than states that did not.9 Yet another consideration is how far in advance of an election one must apply to change one’s political party affiliation. In states with closed primaries, it is important for voters to be allowed to register into whichever party they prefer. This issue came up during the 2016 presidential primaries in New York, where there is a lengthy timeline for changing your party affiliation.

[.my2]
选民登记的另一个重要方面是时间安排。各州可能要求选民在投票前最多 30 天进行登记，也可能允许当天登记。缅因州于 1973 年率先实施了当天登记制度。目前，已有 14 个州和哥伦比亚特区允许选民在选举日当天进行登记，前提是他们持有居住证明，例如驾照或水电费账单。许多人口较多的州（例如密歇根州和德克萨斯州）要求在选举前 30 天邮寄登记表。搬家意味着公民必须重新登记或更新地址（ 图 7.3 ）。例如，大学生可能每年搬家后都需要重新登记或更新地址。在 2012 年总统选举中，实行当天登记制度的州的投票率比不实行该制度的州高出 4%。 9 另一个需要考虑的因素是，选民需要提前多久申请更改其政党归属。在实行封闭式初选的州，允许选民登记加入他们偏好的任何政党至关重要。这个问题在 2016 年纽约州总统初选期间就出现了，因为在纽约州，改变党派归属有很长的期限。

Some attempts have been made to streamline voter registration. The National Voter Registration Act (1993), often referred to as Motor Voter, was enacted to expedite the registration process and make it as simple as possible for voters. The act required states to allow citizens to register to vote when they sign up for driver’s licenses and Social Security benefits. On each government form, the citizen need only mark an additional box to also register to vote. Unfortunately, while increasing registrations by 7 percent between 1992 and 2012, Motor Voter did not dramatically increase voter turnout.10 In fact, for two years following the passage of the act, voter turnout decreased slightly.11 It appears that the main users of the expedited system were those already intending to vote. One study, however, found that preregistration may have a different effect on youth than on the overall voter pool; in Florida, it increased turnout of young voters by 13 percent.12
为了简化选民登记流程，人们做出了一些尝试。《 全国选民登记法》 （1993 年），通常被称为“机动车选民登记法”（Motor Voter），旨在加快登记流程，并尽可能简化选民的登记过程。该法案要求各州允许公民在申请驾照和社会保障福利时同时进行选民登记。在每份政府表格上，公民只需勾选一个额外的方框即可完成选民登记。然而，尽管“机动车选民登记法”在 1992 年至 2012 年间使选民登记人数增加了 7%，但并未显著提高投票率。 10 事实上，在该法案通过后的两年内，投票率略有下降。 11 看来，快速登记系统的主要用户是那些原本就打算投票的人。然而，一项研究发现，预先登记对年轻人的影响可能与对整体选民群体的影响不同；在佛罗里达州，预先登记使年轻选民的投票率提高了 13%。 12

In 2015, Oregon made news when it took the concept of Motor Voter further. When citizens turn eighteen, the state now automatically registers most of them using driver’s license and state identification information. When a citizen moves, the voter rolls are updated when the license is updated. While this policy has been controversial, with some arguing that private information may become public or that Oregon is moving toward mandatory voting, automatic registration is consistent with the state’s efforts to increase registration and turnout.13
2015 年，俄勒冈州进一步推进“机动车选民登记法”（Motor Voter）的概念，引起了广泛关注。如今，当公民年满 18 岁时，该州会自动使用驾照和州身份证信息为大多数公民进行选民登记。当公民搬家时，驾照信息更新后，选民名册也会随之更新。尽管这项政策引发了争议，有人认为私人信息可能会被公开，或者俄勒冈州正在走向强制投票，但自动登记符合该州提高选民登记率和投票率的努力。 13

Oregon’s example offers a possible solution to a recurring problem for states—maintaining accurate voter registration rolls. During the 2000 election, in which George W. Bush won Florida’s electoral votes by a slim majority, attention turned to the state’s election procedures and voter registration rolls. Journalists found that many states, including Florida, had large numbers of phantom voters on their rolls, voters had moved or died but remained on the states’ voter registration rolls.14 The Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) was passed in order to reform voting across the states and reduce these problems. As part of the Act, states were required to update voting equipment, make voting more accessible to people with disabilities, and maintain computerized voter rolls that could be updated regularly.15
俄勒冈州的例子为各州面临的一个反复出现的问题——维护准确的选民登记册——提供了一个可能的解决方案。在 2000 年总统大选中，乔治·W· 布什以微弱优势赢得了佛罗里达州的选举人票，这使得人们的注意力转向了该州的选举程序和选民登记册。记者发现，包括佛罗里达州在内的许多州的选民登记册上存在大量“幽灵选民”，这些选民已经搬迁或去世，但仍然保留在州的选民登记册上。 14 为了改革各州的投票制度并减少这些问题，《2002 年帮助美国投票法案》 （HAVA）获得通过。作为该法案的一部分，各州被要求更新投票设备，使残疾人更容易投票，并维护可以定期更新的计算机化选民登记册。 15

Over a decade later, there has been some progress. In Louisiana, voters are placed on ineligible lists if a voting registrar is notified that they have moved or become ineligible to vote. If the voter remains on this list for two general elections, that registration is cancelled. In Oklahoma, the registrar receives a list of deceased residents from the Department of Health.16 Twenty-nine states now participate in the Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck Program, which allows states to check for duplicate registrations.17 At the same time, Florida’s use of the federal Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database has proven to be controversial, because county elections supervisors are allowed to remove voters deemed ineligible to vote.18
十多年过去了，情况有所好转。在路易斯安那州，如果选民登记员接到通知，得知某位选民已搬迁或丧失投票资格，该选民将被列入不合格选民名单。如果该选民连续两次大选都未出现在该名单上，其选民登记将被取消。在俄克拉荷马州，登记员会收到卫生部门提供的已故居民名单。目前已有 29 个州参与了州际选民登记交叉核查计划 ，该计划允许各州核查重复登记。 与此同时 ，佛罗里达州使用联邦 “系统性外国人权利核查” （SAVE）数据库的做法引发了争议，因为该数据库允许县选举主管移除被认为不合格的选民。

WHO IS ALLOWED TO REGISTER?
哪些人可以注册？
In order to be eligible to vote in the United States, a person must be a citizen, resident, and eighteen years old. But states often place additional requirements on the right to vote. The most common requirement is that voters must be deemed competent and not currently serving time in jail. Some states enforce more stringent or unusual requirements on citizens who have committed crimes. Kentucky permanently bars felons and ex-felons from voting unless they obtain a pardon from the governor, while Florida, Mississippi, and Nevada allow former felons to apply to have their voting rights restored.19 Florida previously had a strict policy against felony voting, like Kentucky. However, through a 2018 initiative petition, Florida voters approved a reinstatement of voting rights for felons after their sentences are completed and any financial debt to society paid.20 On the other end of the spectrum, Vermont does not limit voting based on incarceration unless the crime was election fraud.21 Maine citizens serving in Maine prisons also may vote in elections.

[.my2]
在美国，要获得投票资格，必须是公民、居民且年满十八周岁。但各州通常会对投票权附加其他条件。最常见的条件是选民必须被认定为有行为能力，且目前不在监狱服刑。一些州对曾犯罪的公民实施更严格或更特殊的投票要求。肯塔基州永久禁止重罪犯和前重罪犯投票，除非他们获得州长赦免；而佛罗里达州、密西西比州和内华达州则允许前重罪犯申请恢复投票权。 19 佛罗里达州此前与肯塔基州一样，对重罪犯投票采取严格的政策。然而，通过 2018 年的一项倡议请愿，佛罗里达州选民批准在重罪犯服刑完毕并偿还所有社会债务后恢复其投票权。 20 另一方面，佛蒙特州不会因监禁而限制投票权，除非犯罪行为涉及选举舞弊。 21 在缅因州监狱服刑的缅因州公民也可以参加选举。

Beyond those jailed, some citizens have additional expectations placed on them when they register to vote. Wisconsin requires that voters “not wager on an election,” and Vermont citizens must recite the “Voter’s Oath” before they register, swearing to cast votes with a conscience and “without fear or favor of any person.”22
除了那些被监禁的人之外，一些公民在登记投票时还需遵守额外的规定。威斯康星州要求选民“不得参与选举赌博”，而佛蒙特州的公民在登记前必须宣读“选民誓词”，承诺凭良心投票，“不畏惧任何人，不偏袒任何人”。 22

Where to Register?  在哪里注册？
Across the United States, over twenty million college and university students begin classes each fall, many away from home. The simple act of moving away to college presents a voter registration problem. Elections are local. Each citizen lives in a district with state legislators, city council or other local elected representatives, a U.S. House of Representatives member, and more. State and national laws require voters to reside in their districts, but students are an unusual case. They often hold temporary residency while at school and return home for the summer. Therefore, they have to decide whether to register to vote near campus or vote back in their home district. What are the pros and cons of each option?
在美国，每年秋季有超过两千万大学生和研究生入学，其中许多人离家求学。仅仅是离家上大学这一简单的行为，就带来了选民登记的问题。选举是地方性的。每位公民都居住在一个选区，该选区设有州议员、市议员或其他地方民选代表、美国众议院议员等等。州和联邦法律都要求选民必须居住在其选区内，但学生的情况比较特殊。他们在上学期间通常持有临时居住地，暑假则返回家乡。因此，他们必须决定是在校园附近登记投票，还是回到家乡选区投票。这两种选择各有什么优缺点呢？

Maintaining voter registration back home is legal in most states, assuming a student holds only temporary residency at school. This may be the best plan, because students are likely more familiar with local politicians and issues. But it requires the student to either go home to vote or apply for an absentee ballot. With classes, clubs, work, and more, it may be difficult to remember this task. One study found that students living more than two hours from home were less likely to vote than students living within thirty minutes of campus, which is not surprising.23
在大多数州，如果学生仅在学校拥有临时居住权，那么保留家乡的选民登记是合法的。这可能是最佳方案，因为学生可能更熟悉当地的政治人物和议题。但这需要学生回家投票或申请缺席投票。考虑到课程、社团活动、工作等等，学生可能很难记住这项任务。一项研究发现，居住地距离家超过两小时车程的学生比居住地距离校园 30 分钟车程以内的学生投票的可能性更低，这并不令人意外 。23

Registering to vote near campus makes it easier to vote, but it requires an extra step that students may forget (Figure 7.4). And in many states, registration to vote in a November election takes place in October, just when students are acclimating to the semester. They must also become familiar with local candidates and issues, which takes time and effort they may not have. But they will not have to travel to vote, and their vote is more likely to affect their college and local town.

[.my2]
在校园附近登记投票确实能让投票更便捷，但这需要额外的步骤，学生可能会忘记（ 图 7.4 ）。而且在许多州，11 月大选的选民登记通常在 10 月份进行，而那时学生们正忙于适应新学期。他们还必须熟悉当地的候选人和议题，这需要花费他们可能没有的时间和精力。但他们无需长途跋涉去投票，而且他们的选票更有可能影响到他们的大学和所在城镇。
