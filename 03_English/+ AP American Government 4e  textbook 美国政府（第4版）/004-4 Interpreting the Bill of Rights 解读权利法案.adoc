== 释义



As this chapter has suggested, the provisions of the Bill of Rights have been interpreted and reinterpreted repeatedly over the past two centuries. However, the first eight amendments are largely silent on the status of traditional common law, which was the legal basis for many of the natural rights claimed by the framers in the Declaration of Independence. These amendments largely reflect the worldview of the time in which they were written. New technology, societal norms, and economic realities furnish challenges that fail to fit neatly into the framework established in the late eighteenth century.

正如本章所述，《 权利法案》 的各项条款在过去两个世纪中被反复解读和重新诠释。然而，前八项修正案对传统普通法的地位却鲜有提及，而传统普通法正是《独立宣言》制定者所主张的诸多自然权利的法律基础。这些修正案在很大程度上反映了其制定时代的社会观念。新技术、社会规范和经济现实带来的挑战，使得十八世纪末期建立的法律框架难以完全适用。

In this section, we consider the final two amendments of the Bill of Rights and the way they affect our understanding of the Constitution as a whole. Rather than protecting specific rights and liberties, the Ninth and Tenth Amendments indicate how the Constitution and the Bill of Rights should be interpreted, and lay out the residual powers of the state governments. We will also examine privacy rights, an area the Bill of Rights does not address directly. Rather, the emergence of defined privacy rights demonstrates how the Ninth and Tenth Amendments have been applied to expand the scope of rights protected by the Constitution.

[.my2]
在本节中，我们将探讨《权利法案》的最后两项修正案，以及它们如何影响我们对整部宪法的理解。第九和第十修正案并非保护具体的权利和自由，而是指明了宪法和《权利法案》的解释方式，并阐明了州政府的剩余权力。我们还将考察隐私权，这是《权利法案》未直接涉及的领域。相反，明确规定的隐私权的出现，表明了第九和第十修正案如何被用来扩展宪法所保护的权利范围。

THE NINTH AMENDMENT  第九修正案
We saw above that James Madison and the other framers were aware they might endanger some rights if they listed a few in the Constitution and omitted others. To ensure that those interpreting the Constitution would recognize that the listing of freedoms and rights in the Bill of Rights was not exhaustive, the Ninth Amendment states:
我们前面已经看到，詹姆斯·麦迪逊和其他制宪者意识到，如果他们在宪法中只列举一些权利而忽略其他权利，可能会危及某些权利。为了确保宪法的解释者能够认识到权利法案中列举的自由和权利并非穷尽所有， 第九修正案规定：

“The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.”
“宪法中列举的某些权利，不得解释为否定或贬低人民保留的其他权利。”

These rights “retained by the people” include the common-law and natural rights inherited from the laws, traditions, and past court decisions of England. To this day, we regularly exercise and take for granted rights that aren’t written down in the federal constitution, like the right to marry, the right to seek opportunities for employment and education, and the right to have children and raise a family. Supreme Court justices over the years have interpreted the Ninth Amendment in different ways, with some arguing that it was intended to extend the rights protected by the Constitution to those natural and common-law rights and others arguing that it does not prohibit states from changing their constitutions and laws to modify or limit those rights as they see fit.

[.my2]
这些“人民保留的权利”包括从英国的法律、传统和过往判例中继承的普通法权利和自然权利。时至今日，我们仍然经常行使并理所当然地享有联邦宪法中未明确规定的权利，例如结婚权、寻求就业和教育机会的权利以及生育子女和养育家庭的权利。多年来，最高法院大法官们对第九修正案的解读各不相同，一些大法官认为该修正案旨在将宪法保护的权利扩展到这些自然权利和普通法权利，而另一些大法官则认为该修正案并不禁止各州修改其宪法和法律，以根据自身判断来修改或限制这些权利。

Critics of a broad interpretation of the Ninth Amendment point out that the Constitution provides ways to protect newly formalized rights through the amendment process. For example, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the right to vote was gradually expanded by a series of constitutional amendments (the Fifteenth and Nineteenth), even though at times this expansion was the subject of great public controversy. However, supporters of a broad interpretation of the Ninth Amendment point out that the rights of the people—particularly people belonging to political or demographic minorities—should not be subject to the whims of popular majorities. One right the courts have said may be at least partially based on the Ninth Amendment is a general right to privacy, discussed later in the chapter.

[.my2]
对第九修正案进行宽泛解释的批评者指出，宪法提供了通过修正程序保护新确立的权利的途径。例如，在十九世纪和二十世纪，投票权通过一系列宪法修正案（第十五修正案和第十九修正案）逐步扩大，尽管这种扩大有时引发了巨大的公众争议。然而，支持对第九修正案进行宽泛解释的人指出，人民的权利——特别是属于政治或人口少数群体的人的权利——不应受制于多数人的意愿。法院曾表示，隐私权这一权利可能至少部分基于第九修正案，本章稍后将对此进行讨论。

THE TENTH AMENDMENT  第十修正案
The Tenth Amendment is as follows:
第十修正案内容如下：

“The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”
“宪法未授予合众国的权力，以及宪法未禁止各州行使的权力，均由各州或人民保留。”

Unlike the other provisions of the Bill of Rights, this amendment focuses on power rather than rights. The courts have generally read the Tenth Amendment as merely stating, as Chief Justice Harlan Stone put it, a “truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered.”64 In other words, rather than limiting the power of the federal government in any meaningful way, it simply restates what is made obvious elsewhere in the Constitution: the federal government has both enumerated and implied powers, but where the federal government does not (or chooses not to) exercise power, the states may do so. Others read this final "or" as capturing the essential question of U.S. political history: do the states who agreed to unite in a federal system remain sovereign, or once united, is it the federal government's responsibility to protect the power of the people—including against states that might infringe upon them?
与《权利法案》的其他条款不同，这项修正案关注的是权力而非权利。法院通常将第十修正案解读为，正如首席大法官哈兰· 斯通所言，它仅仅重申了一个“不言而喻的真理：凡未放弃的，均予以保留”。 64 换言之，它并没有以任何实质性的方式限制联邦政府的权力，而只是重申了宪法其他条款中已明确阐述的内容：联邦政府拥有列举的权力和隐含的权力，但如果联邦政府不行使（或选择不行使）权力，则由各州行使。另一些人则认为，最后这个“或”字抓住了美国政治史上的一个根本问题：同意组成联邦制的各州是否仍然拥有主权？或者，一旦联合起来，联邦政府是否有责任保护人民的权力——包括防止各州侵犯人民的权力？

At times, politicians and state governments have argued that the Tenth Amendment means states can engage in interposition or nullification by blocking federal government laws and actions they deem to exceed the constitutional powers of the national government. But the courts have rarely been sympathetic to these arguments, except when the federal government appears to be directly requiring state and local officials to do something. For example, in 1997 the Supreme Court struck down part of a federal law that required state and local law enforcement to participate in conducting background checks for prospective gun purchasers, while in 2012 the court ruled that the government could not compel states to participate in expanding the joint state-federal Medicaid program by taking away all their existing Medicaid funding if they refused to do so.65
有时，政客和州政府会辩称，第十修正案意味着各州可以通过阻止联邦政府的法律和行为，行使干预或无效化权力 ，只要他们认为这些法律和行为超越了联邦政府的宪法权力。但法院很少支持这些论点，除非联邦政府似乎直接要求州和地方官员采取某些行动。例如，1997 年，最高法院推翻了一项联邦法律的部分条款，该条款要求州和地方执法部门参与对潜在购枪者进行背景调查；2012 年，法院裁定，如果各州拒绝参与扩大州联邦联合医疗补助计划，政府不能通过取消其所有现有的医疗补助资金来强迫各州参与。 65

However, the Tenth Amendment also allows states to guarantee rights and liberties more fully or extensively than the federal government does, or to include additional rights. For example, many state constitutions guarantee the right to a free public education, several states give victims of crimes certain rights, and eighteen states include the right to hunt game and/or fish.66 A number of state constitutions explicitly guarantee equal rights for men and women. Starting with Wyoming in 1869, some some states permitted women to vote before the Nineteenth Amendment secured the franchise for all women in 1920. Similarly, people aged 18–20 could vote in a few states before the Twenty-Sixth Amendment came into force in 1971. As we will see below, several states also explicitly recognize a right to privacy. State courts at times have interpreted state constitutional provisions to include broader protections for basic liberties than their federal counterparts. For example, though people do not generally have the right to free speech and assembly on private property owned by others without their permission, California’s constitutional protection of freedom of expression was extended to portions of some privately owned shopping centers by the state’s supreme court (Figure 4.18).67
然而，第十修正案也允许各州比联邦政府更全面或更广泛地保障公民的权利和自由，或增加其他权利。例如，许多州宪法保障公民享有免费公共教育的权利，一些州赋予犯罪受害者某些权利，还有 18 个州赋予公民狩猎和/或捕鱼的权利。 66 许多州宪法明确保障男女平等权利。从 1869 年的怀俄明州开始，一些州在 1920 年第十九修正案保障所有女性选举权之前就允许女性投票。同样，在 1971 年第二十六修正案生效之前，一些州已经允许 18 至 20 岁的公民投票。正如我们将在下文看到的，一些州也明确承认隐私权。州法院有时会解释州宪法条款，认为其对基本自由的保护范围比联邦宪法更为广泛。例如，虽然人们通常没有权利在未经他人许可的情况下在他人私有财产上进行言论和集会，但加州最高法院将加州宪法对言论自由的保护范围扩大到了一些私人拥有的购物中心的部分区域（ 图 4.18 ）。 67

These state protections do not extend the other way, however. If the federal government passes a law or adopts a constitutional amendment that restricts rights or liberties, or a Supreme Court decision interprets the Constitution in a way that narrows these rights, the state’s protection no longer applies. For example, if Congress decided to outlaw hunting and fishing and the Supreme Court decided this law was a valid exercise of federal power, the state constitutional provisions that protect the right to hunt and fish would effectively be meaningless. More concretely, federal laws that control weapons and drugs override state laws and constitutional provisions that otherwise permit them. While federal marijuana policies are not strictly enforced, state-level marijuana policies in Colorado and Washington provide a prominent exception to that clarity.

[.my2]
然而，这些州级保护并不适用于联邦政府。如果联邦政府通过法律或宪法修正案限制权利或自由，或者最高法院的判决对宪法做出限制这些权利的解释，那么州级保护就不再适用。例如，如果国会决定禁止狩猎和捕鱼，而最高法院裁定该法律是联邦权力的合法行使，那么保护狩猎和捕鱼权的州宪法条款实际上就形同虚设。更具体地说，管制武器和毒品的联邦法律优先于允许此类管制的州法律和宪法条款。虽然联邦大麻政策并未得到严格执行，但科罗拉多州和华盛顿州的州级大麻政策却构成了一个显著的例外。

Student-Led Constitutional Change
学生主导的宪法变革
Although the United States has not had a national constitutional convention since 1787, the states have generally been much more willing to revise their constitutions. In 1998, two politicians in Texas decided to do something a little bit different: they enlisted the help of college students at Angelo State University to draft a completely new constitution for the state of Texas, which was then formally proposed to the state legislature.68 Although the proposal failed, it was certainly a valuable learning experience for the students who took part.

[.my2]
尽管美国自 1787 年以来就没有召开过全国制宪会议，但各州通常更愿意修改本州宪法。1998 年，德克萨斯州的两位政客决定采取一种略有不同的做法：他们聘请安吉洛州立大学的大学生起草一部全新的德克萨斯州宪法，并正式提交给州议会。 68 虽然该提案最终未能通过，但对于参与的学生来说，这无疑是一次宝贵的学习经历。

Each state has a different process for changing its constitution. In some, like California and Mississippi, voters can propose amendments to their state constitution directly, bypassing the state legislature. In others, such as Tennessee and Texas, the state legislature controls the process of initiation. The process can affect the sorts of amendments likely to be considered; it shouldn’t be surprising, for example, that amendments limiting the number of terms legislators can serve in office have been much more common in states where the legislators themselves have no say in whether such provisions are adopted.

[.my2]
每个州修改宪法的程序都不尽相同。在一些州，例如加利福尼亚州和密西西比州，选民可以直接提出州宪法修正案，无需经过州议会。而在另一些州，例如田纳西州和德克萨斯州，州议会则控制着修正案的发起程序。这种程序会影响到可能被考虑的修正案类型；例如，在那些议员本身对此类条款的通过没有发言权的州，限制议员任期的修正案更为常见，这并不令人意外。

THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY
隐私权
Although the term privacy does not appear in the Constitution or Bill of Rights, scholars have interpreted several Bill of Rights provisions as an indication that James Madison and Congress sought to protect a common-law right to privacy as it would have been understood in the late eighteenth century: a right to be free of government intrusion into our personal life, particularly within the bounds of the home. For example, one could see the Second Amendment as standing for the common-law right to self-defense in the home; the Third Amendment as a statement that government soldiers should not be housed in anyone’s home; the Fourth Amendment as setting a high legal standard for allowing agents of the state to intrude on someone’s home; and the due process and takings clauses of the Fifth Amendment as applying an equally high legal standard to the government’s taking a home or property (reinforced after the Civil War by the Fourteenth Amendment). Alternatively, one could argue that the Ninth Amendment anticipated the existence of a common-law right to privacy, among other rights, when it acknowledged the existence of basic, natural rights not listed in the Bill of Rights or the body of the Constitution itself.69 Lawyers Samuel D. Warren and Louis Brandeis (the latter a future Supreme Court justice) famously developed the concept of privacy rights in a law review article published in 1890.70
尽管 “隐私权” 一词并未出现在宪法或权利法案中，但学者们已将权利法案中的几项条款解读为詹姆斯·麦迪逊和国会试图保护一种普通法上的隐私权，这种隐私权在十八世纪末期被人们所理解：即免受政府对个人生活，特别是住宅范围内的侵犯的权利。例如，人们可以将第二修正案视为维护普通法上在家中进行自卫的权利；第三修正案表明政府士兵不应驻扎在任何人的住宅中；第四修正案为允许国家机关人员侵入他人住宅设定了很高的法律标准；而第五修正案中的正当程序和征用条款则对政府征用住宅或财产适用了同样高的法律标准（内战后，第十四修正案对此进行了强化）。另一种观点认为，第九修正案在承认《权利法案》或宪法正文中未列明的基本自然权利时，就预见到了普通法中隐私权以及其他权利的存在。 69 律师塞缪尔·D·沃伦和路易斯·布兰代斯（后者是未来的最高法院大法官）在 1890 年发表的一篇法律评论文章中，对隐私权的概念进行了著名的阐述。 70

Although several state constitutions do list the right to privacy as a protected right, the explicit recognition by the Supreme Court of a right to privacy in the U.S. Constitution emerged only in the middle of the twentieth century. In 1965, the court spelled out the right to privacy for the first time in Griswold v. Connecticut, a case that struck down a state law forbidding even married individuals to use any form of contraception.71 Although many subsequent cases before the Supreme Court also dealt with privacy in the course of intimate, sexual conduct, the issue of privacy matters as well in the context of surveillance and monitoring by government and private parties of our activities, movements, and communications. Both these senses of privacy are examined below.

[.my2]
尽管一些州宪法将隐私权列为受保护的权利，但美国最高法院对隐私权的明确承认直到 20 世纪中叶才出现在美国宪法中。1965 年，最高法院在 “格里斯沃尔德诉康涅狄格州案”（Griswold v. Connecticut） 中首次明确阐述了隐私权，该案推翻了一项禁止已婚人士使用任何形式避孕措施的州法律。 71 虽然最高法院随后审理的许多案件也涉及亲密性行为中的隐私问题，但隐私问题在政府和私人机构监视和监控我们的活动、行踪和通信方面同样重要。下文将探讨这两种意义上的隐私。

Sexual Privacy  性隐私
Although the Griswold case originally pertained only to married couples, in 1972 it was extended to apply the right to obtain contraception to unmarried people as well.72 Although neither decision was entirely without controversy, the “sexual revolution” taking place at the time may well have contributed to a sense that anti-contraception laws were at the very least dated, if not in violation of people’s rights. The contraceptive coverage controversy surrounding the Hobby Lobby case shows that this topic remains relevant.

[.my2]
尽管格里斯沃尔德案最初仅适用于已婚夫妇，但在 1972 年，其适用范围扩大到未婚人士，赋予他们获得避孕的权利。 72 虽然这两项判决都并非完全没有争议，但当时的“性革命”很可能促使人们认为，反避孕法至少已经过时，即便没有侵犯人权。围绕霍比罗比案的避孕保险争议表明，这一话题至今仍然具有现实意义。

The Supreme Court’s application of the right to privacy doctrine to abortion rights proved far more problematic, legally and politically. In 1972, four states permitted abortions without restrictions, while thirteen allowed abortions “if the pregnant woman’s life or physical or mental health were endangered, if the fetus would be born with a severe physical or mental defect, or if the pregnancy had resulted from rape or incest”; abortions were completely illegal in Pennsylvania and heavily restricted in the remaining states.73 On average, several hundred American women a year died as a result of “back alley abortions” in the 1960s.

[.my2]
最高法院将隐私权原则应用于堕胎权的做法，在法律和政治上都引发了更大的问题。1972 年，四个州允许无限制堕胎，而十三个州允许在“孕妇的生命或身心健康受到威胁、胎儿出生时患有严重的身体或精神缺陷，或怀孕是强奸或乱伦所致”的情况下进行堕胎；宾夕法尼亚州完全禁止堕胎，其余各州也对堕胎实施了严格限制。 73 20 世纪 60 年代，平均每年有数百名美国妇女死于“非法堕胎”。

The legal landscape changed dramatically as a result of the 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade,74 in which the Supreme Court decided the right to privacy encompassed a right for women to terminate a pregnancy, at least under certain scenarios. The justices ruled that while the government did have an interest in protecting the “potentiality of human life,” nonetheless this had to be balanced against the interests of both women’s health and women’s right to decide whether to have an abortion. Accordingly, the court established a framework for deciding whether abortions could be regulated based on the fetus’s viability (i.e., potential to survive outside the womb) and the stage of pregnancy, with no restrictions permissible during the first three months of pregnancy (i.e., the first trimester), during which abortions were deemed safer for women than childbirth itself.

[.my2]
1973 年罗诉韦德案(Roe v. Wade ) 的裁决彻底改变了法律格局。在该案中，最高法院裁定，隐私权包含女性终止妊娠的权利，至少在某些情况下是如此。大法官们认为，虽然政府确实有权保护“人类生命的可能性”，但这必须与女性的健康以及女性自主决定是否堕胎的权利相平衡。因此，法院建立了一套框架，用于根据胎儿的存活能力（即在子宫外存活的可能性）和妊娠阶段来决定是否可以对堕胎进行监管。在妊娠的前三个月（即妊娠早期），不允许对堕胎进行任何限制，因为在此期间，堕胎被认为比分娩本身对女性更安全。

Starting in the 1980s, Supreme Court justices appointed by Republican presidents began to roll back the Roe decision. A key turning point was the court’s ruling in Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992, in which a plurality of the court rejected Roe’s framework based on trimesters of pregnancy and replaced it with the undue burden test, which allows restrictions prior to viability that are not “substantial obstacle[s]” (undue burdens) to women seeking an abortion.75 Thus, the court upheld some state restrictions, including a required waiting period between arranging and having an abortion, parental consent (or, if not possible for some reason such as incest, authorization of a judge) for minors, and the requirement that women be informed of the health consequences of having an abortion. Other restrictions such as a requirement that a married woman notify her spouse prior to an abortion were struck down as an undue burden. Since the Casey decision, many states have passed other restrictions on abortions, such as banning certain procedures, requiring women to have and view an ultrasound before having an abortion, and implementing more stringent licensing and inspection requirements for facilities where abortions are performed. In Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt (2016), the Court reinforced Roe 5–3 by disallowing two Texas state regulations regarding the delivery of abortion services.76
自 20 世纪 80 年代起，由共和党总统任命的最高法院大法官开始推翻 “罗诉韦德案”的判决。一个关键的转折点是 1992 年最高法院在 “计划生育联合会诉凯西案”中的裁决。在该案中，多数法官驳回了 “罗诉韦德案”基于妊娠三个阶段的框架，并以 “不当负担”检验取而代之。该检验允许在胎儿具备生存能力之前实施限制，但前提是这些限制不会对寻求堕胎的女性构成“实质性障碍”（不当负担）。 75 因此，最高法院维持了一些州级限制，包括安排堕胎和实际堕胎之间必须有等待期、未成年人堕胎需要父母同意（如果由于某些原因，例如乱伦，无法获得父母同意，则需法官授权），以及必须告知女性堕胎的健康后果。其他一些限制，例如要求已婚妇女在堕胎前通知其配偶，则被认定为不当负担而被驳回。自凯西案判决以来，许多州通过了其他限制堕胎的法案，例如禁止某些堕胎手术、要求女性在堕胎前进行并观看超声波检查，以及对堕胎机构实施更严格的许可和检查要求。在 “全女性健康诉赫勒斯泰特案” （2016 年）中，最高法院以 5 比 3 的投票结果，驳回了德克萨斯州两项关于提供堕胎服务的法规，从而巩固了罗诉韦德案的判决。 76

Yet, the abortion issue was far from settled, as the Supreme Court decided in May 2021 to hear in their next term a Mississippi case that would roll back abortion rights considerably. The case would disallow abortions after fifteen weeks. The Court used the case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, to strike down in 2022 much of the legal rationale of both Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In the case the Jackson Women’s Health Organization (Mississippi) sued Thomas E. Dobbs, a health officer with the state, to challenge Mississippi’s state law that banned abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, which violated the 24-week timeline established in Planned Parenthood v. Casey and protected by the 14th Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The court voted 5-4 to overturn both Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, holding that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion and returning much power on abortion rights to the states. The resultant variation in abortion rights across states continues to settle, as many states had not updated their abortion policies since before Roe. At the end of 2024, fourteen states had banned abortion and an additional six states disallowed it between weeks 15 and 24 of the pregnancy. Additionally, arguments about equal access for women to abortion have surfaced, since in many states now, abortion is illegal. Moreover, a salient line has emerged in strict states in terms of what doctors may do to protect the life of the mother and whether to travel out-of-state for an abortion. The challenges for doctors, and of course pregnant women, have been most pronounced in Texas, where an especially strict state abortion policy has taken the statewide average of 4400 abortions per month under Roe down to five per month under Dobbs.77, 78
然而，堕胎问题远未解决。2021 年 5 月，最高法院决定在下一个任期审理一起密西西比州的案件，该案将大幅削弱堕胎权。该案将禁止怀孕 15 周后的堕胎。最高法院利用“ 多布斯诉杰克逊妇女健康组织案”（Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization） 在 2022 年推翻了“罗诉韦德案” （Roe v. Wade） 和“计划生育联合会诉凯西案 ”（Planned Parenthood v. Casey ）的大部分法律依据。在该案中，杰克逊妇女健康组织（密西西比州）起诉了该州卫生官员托马斯·E·多布斯，挑战密西西比州禁止怀孕 15 周后堕胎的法律。该法律违反了 “计划生育联合会诉凯西案”确立的 24 周堕胎期限， 而这一期限受到美国宪法第十四修正案正当程序条款的保护。最高法院以 5 比 4 的投票结果推翻了 “罗诉韦德案” 和 “计划生育联合会诉凯西案” ，裁定宪法并未赋予女性堕胎权，并将堕胎权的大部分权力交还给了各州。由于许多州自“罗诉韦德案”之前就未更新过堕胎政策，各州堕胎权的差异仍在持续。截至 2024 年底，已有 14 个州禁止堕胎，另有 6 个州禁止在怀孕 15 周至 24 周之间进行堕胎。此外，由于许多州目前堕胎违法，关于女性平等获得堕胎权的争论也随之出现。而且，在一些堕胎政策较为严格的州，关于医生在保护孕妇生命方面可以采取哪些措施以及孕妇是否可以跨州堕胎，出现了一条明显的界限。 在德克萨斯州，医生和孕妇面临的挑战最为突出。该州一项特别严格的堕胎政策使得罗诉韦德案判决下全州平均每月堕胎 4400 例，而多布斯案判决下则降至每月 5 例。77 ，78

Beyond the issues of contraception and abortion, the right to privacy has been interpreted to encompass a more general right for adults to have noncommercial, consensual sexual relationships in private. However, this legal development is relatively new; as recently as 1986, the Supreme Court ruled that states could still criminalize sex acts between two people of the same sex.79 That decision was overturned in 2003 in Lawrence v. Texas, which invalidated state laws that criminalized sodomy. Moreover, the 2020 decision in Bostock v. Clayton County established that someone’s sexual orientation could not be used as a basis for firing them.80
除了避孕和堕胎问题之外，隐私权已被解释为包含成年人在私下进行非商业性、双方自愿的性关系的更广泛权利。然而，这一法律发展相对较新；就在 1986 年，最高法院还裁定各州仍然可以将同性之间的性行为定为犯罪。 79 2003 年，在 “劳伦斯诉德克萨斯州案”中，这一裁决被推翻，该案宣布将鸡奸定为犯罪的州法律无效。此外，2020 年在“ 博斯托克诉克莱顿县案”中，法院确立了不得以性取向为由解雇某人。 80

The state and national governments still have leeway to regulate sexual morality to some degree; “anything goes” is not the law of the land, even for actions that are consensual. The Supreme Court has declined to strike down laws in a few states that outlaw the sale of vibrators and other sex toys. Prostitution remains illegal in every state except in certain rural counties in Nevada; both polygamy (marriage to more than one other person) and bestiality (sex with animals) are illegal everywhere. And, as we saw earlier, the states may regulate obscene materials and, in certain situations, material that may be harmful to minors or otherwise indecent; to this end, states and localities have sought to ban or regulate the production, distribution, and sale of pornography.

[.my2]
州政府和联邦政府在一定程度上仍有权力规范性道德；“一切皆可”并非法律，即使是双方自愿的行为也不例外。最高法院拒绝推翻几个州禁止销售振动器和其他性玩具的法律。除内华达州某些农村县外，卖淫在所有州仍然是非法的；一夫多妻制（与多人结婚）和兽交（与动物发生性关系）在任何地方都是非法的。而且，正如我们之前看到的，各州可以监管淫秽物品，在某些情况下，还可以监管可能对未成年人有害或有伤风化的其他物品；为此，各州和地方政府一直在寻求禁止或监管色情制品的制作、发行和销售。

Privacy of Communications and Property
通信和财产隐私
Another example of heightened concerns about privacy in the modern era is the reality that society is under pervasive surveillance. In the past, monitoring the public was difficult at best. During the Cold War, regimes in the Soviet bloc employed millions of people as domestic spies and informants in an effort to suppress internal dissent through constant monitoring of the general public. Not only was this effort extremely expensive in terms of the human and monetary capital it required, but it also proved remarkably ineffective. Groups like the East German Stasi and the Romanian Securitate were unable to suppress the popular uprisings that undermined communist one-party rule in most of those countries in the late 1980s.

现代社会对隐私日益关注的另一个例证是，社会实际上处于无处不在的监控之下。过去，监控公众充其量也只能说是困难重重。冷战期间，苏联集团的政权雇佣了数百万人作为国内间谍和线人，试图通过对公众的持续监控来压制内部异议。这种做法不仅耗费了大量的人力物力，而且效果也极其有限。例如，东德国家安全部（Stasi）和罗马尼亚国家安全局（Securitate）等机构，都未能镇压 20 世纪 80 年代末席卷这些国家、最终瓦解共产党一党专政的民众起义。

Technology has now made it much easier to track and monitor people. Police cars and roadways are equipped with cameras that can photograph the license plate of every passing car or truck and record it in a database; while allowing police to recover stolen vehicles and catch fleeing suspects, this data can also be used to track the movements of law-abiding citizens. But law enforcement officials don’t even have to go to this much work; millions of car and truck drivers pay tolls electronically without stopping at toll booths thanks to transponders attached to their vehicles, which can be read by scanners well away from any toll road or bridge to monitor traffic flow or any other purpose (Figure 4.20). Some locations no longer have a cash option, which means that crossing a bridge or using a road requires the driver to be tracked by the transponder or by their license plate. The pervasive use of GPS (Global Positioning System) raises similar issues.

如今，科技使得追踪和监控人员变得更加容易。警车和道路都配备了摄像头，可以拍摄每辆过往车辆的车牌并记录在数据库中；这些数据不仅能帮助警方找回被盗车辆和抓捕逃犯，还能用来追踪守法公民的行踪。但执法人员甚至无需如此费力；数百万汽车和卡车司机无需在收费站停车，即可通过安装在车辆上的电子标签支付通行费。这些标签可以被远离收费公路或桥梁的扫描仪读取，用于监控交通流量或其他用途（ 图 4.20 ）。一些地方已经不再接受现金支付，这意味着过桥或使用道路需要通过电子标签或车牌号来追踪驾驶员。全球定位系统 (GPS) 的广泛应用也引发了类似的问题。

Figure 4.20 One form of technology that has made it easier to potentially monitor people’s movements is electronic toll collection, such as the E-ZPass system in the Midwest and Northeast, FasTrak in California, and I-Pass in Illinois. With some cities and states moving entirely to cashless tolling, which uses either devices or the license plate to assess the toll, drivers have little choice but to be tracked.

Even pedestrians and cyclists are relatively easy to track today. Cameras pointed at sidewalks and roadways can employ facial recognition software to identify people as they walk or bike around a city. Many people carry smartphones that constantly report their location to the nearest cell phone tower and broadcast a beacon signal to nearby wireless hotspots and Bluetooth devices. Police can set up a small device called a Stingray that identifies and tracks all cell phones that attempt to connect to it within a radius of several thousand feet. With the right software, law enforcement and criminals can remotely activate a phone’s microphone and camera, effectively planting a bug in someone’s pocket without the person even knowing it.

如今，即使是行人和骑自行车的人也相对容易被追踪。安装在人行道和道路上的摄像头可以利用面部识别软件来识别在城市中行走或骑行的人。许多人携带的智能手机会不断向最近的手机信号塔报告位置，并向附近的无线热点和蓝牙设备广播信标信号。警方可以设置一种名为“黄貂鱼”（Stingray）的小型设备，识别并追踪半径数千英尺范围内所有试图连接它的手机。借助合适的软件，执法人员和犯罪分子可以远程激活手机的麦克风和摄像头，相当于在某人的口袋里植入了一个窃听器，而对方却毫不知情。

These aren’t just gimmicks in a bad science fiction movie; businesses and governments have openly admitted they are using these methods. Research shows that even metadata—information about the messages we send and the calls we make and receive, such as time, location, sender, and recipient but excluding their content—can tell governments and businesses a lot about what someone is doing. Even when this information is collected in an anonymous way, it is often still possible to trace it back to specific individuals, since people travel and communicate in largely predictable patterns.

这些并非科幻电影里的噱头；企业和政府都已公开承认正在使用这些方法。研究表明，即使是元数据——关于我们发送的信息以及拨打和接收的电话的信息，例如时间、地点、发件人和收件人，但不包括内容——也能让政府和企业掌握大量关于个人行为的信息。即使这些信息是以匿名方式收集的，通常仍然可以追溯到特定个人，因为人们的出行和沟通模式在很大程度上是可以预测的。

The next frontier of privacy issues may well be the increased use of drones, small preprogrammed or remotely piloted aircraft. Drones can fly virtually undetected and monitor events from overhead. They can peek into backyards surrounded by fences, and using infrared cameras they can monitor activity inside houses and other buildings. The Fourth Amendment was written in an era when finding out what was going on in someone’s home meant either going inside or peeking through a window; applying its protections today, when seeing into someone’s house can be as easy as looking at a computer screen miles away, is no longer simple.

隐私问题的下一个前沿领域很可能是无人机的日益普及，这种小型预编程或遥控飞行器可以悄无声息地飞行，并从空中监视各种事件。它们可以窥视被围栏环绕的后院，并利用红外摄像头监控房屋和其他建筑物内部的活动。第四修正案制定于一个时代，那时了解他人家中的情况要么需要进入屋内，要么需要透过窗户窥视；而如今，窥视他人住宅就像隔着几英里远的电脑屏幕一样容易，因此运用该修正案的保护措施已不再那么简单。

In the United States, many advocates of civil liberties are concerned that laws such as the USA PATRIOT Act (i.e., Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act), passed weeks after the 9/11 attacks in 2001, have given the federal government too much power by making it easy for officials to seek and obtain search warrants or, in some cases, to bypass warrant requirements altogether. Critics have argued that the Patriot Act has largely been used to prosecute ordinary criminals, in particular drug dealers, rather than terrorists as intended. Most European countries, at least on paper, have opted for laws that protect against such government surveillance, perhaps mindful of past experience with communist and fascist regimes. European countries also tend to have stricter laws limiting the collection, retention, and use of private data by companies, which makes it harder for governments to obtain and use that data. Most recently, the battle between Apple Inc. and the National Security Agency (NSA) over whether Apple should allow the government access to key information that is encrypted has made the discussion of this tradeoff salient once again. A recent court outcome in the United States suggests that America may follow Europe's lead. In Carpenter v. United States (2018), the first case of its kind, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that, under the Fourth Amendment, police need a search warrant to gather phone location data as evidence to be used in trials.81
在美国，许多公民自由倡导者担心，诸如《美国爱国者法案》 （即《通过提供拦截和阻止恐怖主义的必要工具来团结和加强美国法案》）之类的法律赋予了联邦政府过大的权力。该法案在 2001 年 9·11 事件发生几周后获得通过，使得官员更容易申请和获得搜查令，甚至在某些情况下完全绕过搜查令的要求。批评者认为，《 爱国者法案》 在很大程度上被用来起诉普通罪犯，特别是毒贩，而不是像其初衷那样打击恐怖分子。大多数欧洲国家，至少在纸面上，都选择了制定法律来保护公民免受此类政府监控，这或许是出于对过去共产主义和法西斯政权经验的警觉。欧洲国家也往往拥有更严格的法律，限制公司收集、保留和使用私人数据，这使得政府更难获取和使用这些数据。最近，苹果公司与美国国家安全局（NSA）之间关于苹果是否应该允许政府访问加密关键信息的争论，再次凸显了这一权衡取舍的重要性。美国最近的一项法院判决表明，美国可能会效仿欧洲的做法。在卡彭特诉美国案 （2018 年）中，这是同类案件中的首例，美国最高法院裁定，根据宪法第四修正案，警方需要搜查令才能收集手机位置数据作为审判证据 。81

All this is not to say that technological surveillance tools do not have value or are inherently bad. They can be used for many purposes that would benefit society and, perhaps, even enhance our freedoms. Spending less time stuck in traffic because we know there’s been an accident—detected automatically because the cell phones that normally whiz by at the speed limit are now crawling along—gives us time to spend on more valuable activities. Capturing criminals and terrorists by recognizing them or their vehicles before they can continue their agendas will protect the life, liberty, and property of the public at large. At the same time, however, the emergence of these technologies means calls for vigilance and limits on what businesses and governments can do with the information they collect and the length of time they may retain it. We might also be concerned about how this technology could be used by more oppressive regimes. If the technological resources that are at the disposal of today’s governments had been available to the East Germany Stasi and the Romanian Securitate, would those repressive regimes have fallen? How much privacy and freedom should citizens sacrifice in order to feel safe?
这一切并非意味着技术监控工具毫无价值或本质上是邪恶的。它们可以用于许多造福社会、甚至可能增进我们自由的用途。例如，由于我们能够自动检测到交通事故（因为通常以限速飞驰而过的手机现在行驶缓慢），从而减少因交通堵塞而耽误的时间，让我们有更多时间从事更有价值的活动。在罪犯和恐怖分子继续其犯罪活动之前，通过识别他们或他们的车辆来抓捕他们，将有助于保护广大公众的生命、自由和财产安全。然而，与此同时，这些技术的出现也意味着我们需要保持警惕，并限制企业和政府如何使用他们收集的信息以及保留信息的时间。我们或许还应该关注这项技术可能被更专制的政权所利用。如果东德秘密警察和罗马尼亚国家安全局当年也能拥有如今各国政府所掌握的技术资源，这些专制政权是否会垮台？为了获得安全感，公民应该牺牲多少隐私和自由？
