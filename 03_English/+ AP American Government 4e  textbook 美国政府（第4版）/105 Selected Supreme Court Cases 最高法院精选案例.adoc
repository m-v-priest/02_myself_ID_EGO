A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935). This case represented a challenge to the constitutionality of a law called the National Industrial Recovery Act. This law was a major part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s attempt to rebuild the nation’s economy during the Great Depression. Major industries in the United States, however, objected to the way the law empowered the president to regulate aspects of American industry, such as labor conditions and even pay. In the unanimous decision, the court determined that the act was unconstitutional because it shifted the power to regulate commerce from the legislative branch to the executive branch.

ALA Schechter Poultry Corp.诉美国案 ，295 US 495 (1935)。 该案对一项名为《国家工业复兴法》的法律的合宪性提出了挑战。该法是富兰克林·罗斯福总统在大萧条时期重建国家经济的重要举措之一。然而，美国的主要产业反对该法赋予总统权力来监管美国工业的诸多方面，例如劳动条件甚至工资。法院一致裁定该法违宪，因为它将商业监管权从立法部门转移到了行政部门。

Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387 (2012). This case involved federal attempts to prevent an Arizona state immigration law (S.B. 1070) from being enforced. The United States brought suit, arguing that immigration law is exclusively in the federal domain. Agreeing with the federal government, a federal district court enjoined specific provisions in the law. Arizona appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn the decision. In a 5–3 decision, the court found that specific provisions in the law did conflict with federal law, while others were constitutional.

亚利桑那州诉美国案 ，567 US 387 (2012)。 本案涉及联邦政府试图阻止亚利桑那州一项移民法案（SB 1070）的实施。美国提起诉讼，主张移民法属于联邦专属管辖范围。联邦地区法院同意联邦政府的观点，并颁布禁令，禁止执行该法案中的特定条款。亚利桑那州向最高法院提起上诉，要求推翻该裁决。最高法院以 5 比 3 的投票结果裁定，该法案中的某些条款确实与联邦法律相冲突，而其他条款则符合宪法。

Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020). This case involved reconciling Federal law regarding employment discrimination in governmental (Bostock v. Clayton County) and private organizations (Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda, R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission). The plaintiff, Gerald Bostock, was fired from his position with the county for raising interest in a gay softball team while at work. In a 6-3 decision, the court found that an employer that terminates an employee for being gay or transgender is in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Importantly, the Court (with Justice Neil Gorsuch writing for the majority) specifically indicated that discrimination due to sexual orientation or gender identity is equivalent to discrimination on the basis of sex, long prohibited by Title VII.

博斯托克诉克莱顿县案 ，590 US 644 (2020)。 本案涉及协调联邦法律中关于政府机构（ 博斯托克诉克莱顿县案 ）和私营机构（ Altitude Express, Inc.诉 Zarda, RG & GR Harris Funeral Homes, Inc.诉平等就业机会委员会案 ）就业歧视的规定。原告杰拉尔德·博斯托克因在工作期间表达对一支同性恋垒球队的兴趣而被县政府解雇。法院以 6 比 3 的投票结果裁定，雇主因雇员是同性恋或跨性别者而将其解雇，违反了 1964 年《民权法案》第七章的规定。值得注意的是，法院（尼尔·戈萨奇大法官代表多数意见撰写判决书）明确指出，基于性取向或性别认同的歧视等同于基于性别的歧视，而后者长期以来一直受到《民权法案》第七章的禁止。

Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954). This case represented a challenge to the principle of “separate but equal” established by Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896. The case was brought by students who were denied admittance to certain public schools based exclusively on race. The unanimous decision in Brown v. Board determined that the existence of racially segregated public schools violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court decided that schools segregated by race perpetrated harm by giving legal sanction to the idea that African Americans were inherently inferior. The ruling effectively overturned Plessy v. Ferguson and removed the legal supports for segregated schools nationwide.

布朗诉托皮卡教育委员会案，347 US 483 (1954)。 此案挑战了 1896 年普莱西诉弗格森案确立的“隔离但平等”原则。 提起诉讼的是一些学生，他们仅仅因为种族原因而被某些公立学校拒之门外。 布朗诉托皮卡教育委员会案的一致判决认定，种族隔离的公立学校违反了美国宪法第十四修正案的平等保护条款。法院认为，种族隔离的学校通过法律认可了非裔美国人天生低人一等的观念，造成了伤害。该判决实际上推翻了普莱西诉弗格森案的判决，并消除了全国范围内种族隔离学校的法律依据。

Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976). This case concerned the power of the then recently created Federal Election Commission to regulate the financing of political campaigns. These restrictions limited the amount of contributions that could be made to candidates and required political contributions to be disclosed, among other things. In 1975, Senator James Buckley filed suit, arguing that these limits amounted to a violation of First Amendment protections on free speech and free association. In a series of decisions in this complex case, the court determined that these restrictions did not violate the First Amendment.

[.my2]
巴克利诉瓦莱奥案 ，424 US 1 (1976)。 本案涉及当时新成立的联邦选举委员会监管政治竞选资金的权力。这些限制规定了可以捐赠给候选人的金额，并要求披露政治捐款等事项。1975 年，参议员詹姆斯·巴克利提起诉讼，认为这些限制侵犯了宪法第一修正案对言论自由和结社自由的保护。在这一复杂案件的一系列判决中，法院最终裁定这些限制并未违反宪法第一修正案。

Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682 (2014). This case involved a challenge to the mandate in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that required that all employment-based group health care plans provide coverage for certain types of contraceptives. The law, however, allowed exemptions for religious employers such as churches that held a religious-based opposition to contraception. The plaintiffs in the case argued that Hobby Lobby, a large family-owned chain of arts and crafts stores, was run based on Christian principles and therefore should be exempt as well because of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA). The 5–4 decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby agreed with the plaintiffs and declared that RFRA permits for-profit companies like Hobby Lobby to deny coverage for contraception in their health plans when that coverage violates a religious belief.

[.my2]
伯韦尔诉霍比罗比商店公司案 ，573 US 682 (2014)。 本案涉及对《患者保护与平价医疗法案》中一项强制性规定的挑战，该规定要求所有雇主提供的团体医疗保险计划必须涵盖某些类型的避孕措施。然而，该法案允许宗教雇主（例如基于宗教信仰反对避孕的教会）获得豁免。本案原告辩称，霍比罗比是一家大型家族式工艺品连锁店，其经营基于基督教原则，因此也应根据 1993 年《宗教自由恢复法案》（RFRA）获得豁免。 伯韦尔诉霍比罗比案以 5 比 4 的投票结果支持了原告的观点，并宣布 RFRA 允许像霍比罗比这样的营利性公司在其医疗保险计划中拒绝提供避孕措施，因为此类措施违反了其宗教信仰。

Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000). Following voting in the November 2000 presidential election, observers recognized that the outcome of the very close national election hinged on the outcome of the election in Florida. Because the Florida election was so close, manual recounts were called for by the state’s supreme court. Then-governor George W. Bush, who was ahead in the initial count, appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to halt the manual recount and to declare that the method of manual recount being used violated his rights to equal protection and due process. The court issued a two-part per curiam opinion on the case. (In a per curiam opinion, the court makes it clear that the decision in the case is not intended to set a legal precedent.) In the first part, the court ruled in a 7–2 decision that the manual recount did violate the plaintiff’s right to equal protection. In the second part, decided by a smaller 5–4 margin, the court ruled that there was not sufficient time to adjust the recount procedure and conduct a full recount. The effect of this ruling gave the Florida electoral votes, and thus the presidency, to George W. Bush.

布什诉戈尔案 ，531 US 98 (2000)。 2000 年 11 月总统大选投票结束后，观察人士意识到，这场势均力敌的全国大选结果取决于佛罗里达州的选举结果。由于佛罗里达州的选举结果非常接近，该州最高法院要求进行人工重新计票。时任州长乔治·W·布什在初次计票中领先，他向美国最高法院提出上诉，要求停止人工重新计票，并宣布所使用的人工重新计票方法侵犯了他享有平等保护权和正当程序权的权利。最高法院就此案发布了分为两部分的简易判决意见。（ 简易判决意见中，法院明确表示，该案的裁决并非旨在确立法律先例。）在第一部分意见中，最高法院以 7 比 2 的投票结果裁定，人工重新计票确实侵犯了原告的平等保护权。在第二部分裁决中，法院以 5 比 4 的较小优势裁定，没有足够的时间调整重新计票程序并进行全面重新计票。这一裁决的结果是，佛罗里达州的选举人票，以及总统职位，都归于乔治·W·布什。

Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 310 (2010). In 2007, the nonprofit corporation Citizens United was prevented by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) from showing a movie about then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The FEC noted that showing the movie violated the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA). BCRA prohibited campaign communications one month before a primary election and two months before a general election, required donors to be disclosed, and prohibited corporations from using their general funds for campaign communications. The plaintiffs argued that these restrictions constituted a violation of the First Amendment. The 5–4 decision in Citizens United v. FEC agreed with the plaintiffs and concluded that the restrictions imposed by BCRA and enforced by the FEC violated the corporation’s First Amendment right to free expression.

[.my2]
公民联合诉联邦选举委员会案 ，558 US 310 (2010)。 2007 年，非营利机构“公民联合”被联邦选举委员会（FEC）禁止放映一部关于时任总统候选人希拉里·克林顿的影片。联邦选举委员会指出，放映该影片违反了《两党竞选改革法案》（BCRA）。BCRA 禁止在初选前一个月和普选前两个月进行竞选宣传，要求披露捐款人信息，并禁止机构使用其一般资金进行竞选宣传。原告方认为，这些限制构成对美国宪法第一修正案的侵犯。在 “公民联合诉联邦选举委员会”一案中，最高法院以 5 比 4 的投票结果支持原告方的观点，并裁定 BCRA 施加的限制以及联邦选举委员会的执行侵犯了该机构受美国宪法第一修正案保护的言论自由权。

City of Grants Pass v. Johnson, 603 U.S. 520 (2024). This case pertained to the legality of local government fines for encampments on public land, which is an important topic relating to the rights of the homeless population as well as the rights of protestors who form encampments to advocate for a variety of political causes. The anti-camping ordinances of the City of Grants Pass, Oregon, which Gloria Johnson and other homeless persons violated by camping on public land, brought a $295 fine, rising to over $500 if not quickly paid. Johnson’s attorney argued that this scheme, given the amount of the fines relative to the average cost of rental housing and with homeless shelters completely full, lacked a rational basis beyond criminalizing the homeless, and hence resulted in cruel and unusual punishment. In a 6-3 decision that effectively pushed the issue to the American states, the Court ruled that the city had applied its policies neutrally and that the penalties for camping on public land do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment of homeless people.

[.my2]
格兰茨帕斯市诉约翰逊案 ，603 US 520 (2024)。 本案涉及地方政府对在公共土地上露营者处以罚款的合法性，这是一个关乎无家可归者权利以及为倡导各种政治诉求而设立营地的抗议者权利的重要议题。格洛丽亚·约翰逊和其他无家可归者因在俄勒冈州格兰茨帕斯市的公共土地上露营而违反了该市的反露营条例，被处以 295 美元的罚款，如果不及时缴纳，罚款金额将超过 500 美元。约翰逊的律师辩称，鉴于罚款金额相对于平均租金而言过高，且无家可归者收容所已全部爆满，这种做法除了将无家可归者定罪之外缺乏合理依据，因此构成残酷和不寻常的惩罚。最高法院以 6 比 3 的裁决，实际上将这个问题推给了美国各州。法院裁定，该市已中立地执行了其政策，并且对在公共土地上露营的处罚不构成对无家可归者的残酷和不寻常的惩罚。

Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, 597 U.S. 215 (2022). This case tested the Constitutional right to an abortion established by the Court in Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992). In the case the Jackson Women’s Health Organization (Mississippi) sued Thomas E. Dobbs, a health officer with the state, to challenge Mississippi’s state law that banned abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, which violated the 24-week timeline established in Planned Parenthood v. Casey and protected by the 14th Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The court voted 5-4 to overturn both Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, holding that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion and returning much power on abortion rights to the states.

[.my2]
多布斯诉杰克逊妇女健康组织案 ，597 US 215 (2022)。 本案检验了最高法院在罗诉韦德案 （1973）和计划生育联合会诉凯西案 （1992）中确立的堕胎权宪法原则。本案中，杰克逊妇女健康组织（密西西比州）起诉该州卫生官员托马斯·E·多布斯，挑战密西西比州禁止怀孕 15 周后堕胎的法律。该法律违反了计划生育联合会诉凯西案确立的 24 周堕胎期限，而这一期限受宪法第十四修正案正当程序条款的保护。最高法院以 5 比 4 的投票结果推翻了罗诉韦德案和计划生育联合会诉凯西案的判决，裁定宪法并未赋予堕胎权，并将堕胎权的很大一部分权力交还给了各州。

Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. 393 (1856). This case concerned the constitutionality of the Missouri Compromise, which declared that certain states would be entirely free of slavery. Dred Scott, an enslaved person, was brought by his owner into free territories. When the owner brought him back to Missouri, a slave state, Dred Scott sued claiming that his time living in free territory made him free. After failing in his attempts in Missouri, Scott appealed to the Supreme Court. In a 7–2 decision, the court declared that the relevant parts of the Missouri Compromise were unconstitutional, and that Scott remained enslaved as a result.

[.my2]
德雷德·斯科特诉桑福德案 ，60 US 393 (1856)。 本案涉及《密苏里妥协案》的合宪性，该妥协案宣布某些州将完全废除奴隶制。德雷德·斯科特是一名奴隶，他的主人将他带到自由州。当主人将他带回蓄奴州密苏里州时，德雷德·斯科特提起诉讼，声称他在自由州生活期间已获得自由。在密苏里州的诉讼失败后，斯科特向最高法院提起上诉。最高法院以 7 比 2 的投票结果裁定，《密苏里妥协案》的相关部分违宪，因此斯科特仍为奴隶。

Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963). In 1961, Clarence E. Gideon was arrested and accused of breaking into a poolroom and stealing money from a cigarette machine. Not being able to afford a lawyer, and being denied a public defender by the judge, Gideon defended himself and was subsequently found guilty. Gideon appealed to the Supreme Court declaring that the denial by the trial judge constituted a violation of his constitutional right to representation. The unanimous decision by the court in Gideon v. Wainwright agreed that the Sixth Amendment required that those facing felony criminal charges be supplied with legal representation.

[.my2]
吉迪恩诉温赖特案 ，372 US 335 (1963)。 1961 年，克拉伦斯·E·吉迪恩因涉嫌闯入台球室并从香烟自动售货机盗窃钱财而被捕。由于无力聘请律师，且法官拒绝为其指派公设辩护人，吉迪恩选择自行辩护，最终被判有罪。吉迪恩向最高法院提起上诉，声称审判法官拒绝为其指派公设辩护人侵犯了他获得法律援助的宪法权利。最高法院在吉迪恩诉温赖特案中一致裁定，第六修正案要求为面临重罪指控的人提供法律援助。

King v. Burwell, 576 U.S. 473 (2015). When Congress wrote and passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010, lawmakers intended for states to create exchanges through which residents in those states could purchase health care insurance plans. For those residents who could not afford the premiums, the law also allowed for tax credits to help reduce the cost. If states didn’t create an exchange, the federal government created the exchange for the state. While the intention of the lawmakers was for the tax credits to apply to the federally created exchanges as well, the language of the law was somewhat unclear on this point. Residents in Virginia brought suit against the law arguing that the law should be interpreted in a way that withholds tax credits from those participating in the federally created exchange. In the 6–3 decision, the court disagreed, stating that viewing the law in its entirety made it clear that the intent of the law was to provide the tax credits to those participating in either exchange.

[.my2]
金诉伯韦尔案 ，576 US 473 (2015)。 2010 年，国会制定并通过了《患者保护与平价医疗法案》，立法者意图让各州建立医疗保险交易平台，供本州居民购买医疗保险计划。对于无力承担保费的居民，该法案还允许提供税收抵免以降低成本。如果各州没有建立交易平台，则由联邦政府为其建立。尽管立法者的意图是让税收抵免也适用于联邦政府建立的交易平台，但该法案在这方面的措辞并不十分明确。弗吉尼亚州的居民就此提起诉讼，认为该法案应作如下解释：参与联邦政府建立的交易平台的居民无法获得税收抵免。在 6 比 3 的裁决中，法院驳回了这一诉讼请求，认为从整体上看，该法案的意图很明确，即向参与联邦政府或州政府建立的交易平台的居民提供税收抵免。

Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003). This case concerned two men in Houston who in 1998 were prosecuted and convicted under a Texas law that forbade certain types of intimate sexual relations between two persons of the same sex. The men appealed to the Supreme Court arguing that their Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection and privacy were violated when they were prosecuted for consensual sexual intimacy in their own home. In the 6–3 decision in Lawrence v. Texas, the court concluded that while so-called anti-sodomy statutes like the law in Texas did not violate one’s right to equal protection, they did violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court stated that the government had no right to infringe on the liberty of persons engaging in such private and personal acts.

[.my2]
劳伦斯诉德克萨斯州案 ，539 US 558 (2003)。 该案涉及两名休斯顿男子，他们于 1998 年因违反德克萨斯州一项禁止同性之间某些类型亲密性关系的法律而被起诉和定罪。这两名男子向最高法院提起上诉，认为他们在自己家中因自愿的性行为而被起诉，侵犯了他们受宪法第十四修正案保护的平等保护权和隐私权。在劳伦斯诉德克萨斯州案中，最高法院以 6 比 3 的投票结果裁定，虽然像德克萨斯州法律这样的所谓反鸡奸法并未侵犯公民的平等保护权，但却违反了宪法第十四修正案的正当程序条款。法院指出，政府无权侵犯从事此类私人行为的个人的自由。

Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803). This case involved the nomination of justices of the peace in Washington, DC, by President John Adams at the end of his term. Despite the Senate confirming the nominations, some of the commissions were not delivered before Adams left office. The new president, Thomas Jefferson, decided not to deliver the commissions. William Marbury, one of the offended justices, sued, saying that the Judiciary Act of 1789 empowered the court to force Secretary of State James Madison to deliver the commissions. In the unanimous decision in Marbury v. Madison, the court declared that while Marbury’s rights were violated when Madison refused to deliver the commission, the court did not have the power to force the secretary to do so despite what the Judiciary Act says. In declaring that the law conflicted with the U.S. Constitution, the case established the principle of judicial review wherein the Supreme Court has the power to declare laws passed by Congress and signed by the president to be unconstitutional.

[.my2]
马伯里诉麦迪逊案 ，5 US 137 (1803)。 此案涉及约翰·亚当斯总统在其任期结束时对华盛顿特区治安法官的提名。尽管参议院确认了这些提名，但在亚当斯卸任前，部分任命书仍未送达。新任总统托马斯·杰斐逊决定不予送达。威廉·马伯里是其中一位受到冒犯的治安法官，他提起诉讼，声称 1789 年的《司法法案》授权法院强制国务卿詹姆斯·麦迪逊送达任命书。在马伯里诉麦迪逊案的一致判决中，法院宣布，尽管麦迪逊拒绝送达任命书侵犯了马伯里的权利，但即使《司法法案》另有规定，法院也无权强制国务卿这样做。该案裁定该法案与美国宪法相抵触，确立了司法审查原则，即最高法院有权宣布国会通过并由总统签署的法律违宪。

McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. 742 (2010). This case developed as a consequence of the decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008), which dismissed a Washington, DC, handgun ban as a violation of the Second Amendment. In McDonald v. Chicago, the plaintiffs argued that the Fourteenth Amendment had the effect of applying the Second Amendment to the states, not just to the federal government. In a 5–4 decision, the court agreed with the plaintiffs and concluded that rights like the right to keep and bear arms are important enough for maintaining liberty that the Fourteenth Amendment rightly applies them to the states.

[.my2]
麦克唐纳诉芝加哥案 ，561 US 742 (2010)。 该案源于哥伦比亚特区诉赫勒案 ，554 US 570 (2008) 的判决。该案驳回了华盛顿特区的手枪禁令，认为其违反了第二修正案。在麦克唐纳诉芝加哥案中，原告辩称第十四修正案的效力在于将第二修正案的适用范围扩展至各州，而不仅仅是联邦政府。最高法院以 5 比 4 的投票结果支持原告的观点，并裁定诸如持有和携带武器的权利对于维护自由至关重要，因此第十四修正案将其适用于各州是合理的。

McGirt v. Oklahoma, 591 U. S. 894 (2020). This case pertained to a state’s (Oklahoma) authority to convict Native American criminals on designated tribal lands within that state. Jimcy McGirt (a Muscogee [Creek] Nation member) was convicted by the State of Oklahoma of child sex crimes carried out within the historical lands of the Creek Nation. The plaintiff argued that the US Federal government should have jurisdiction rather than the State of Oklahoma, based on the Indian Major Crimes Act of 1885 and other federal laws that established the Creek tribal lands. The State of Oklahoma argued that, after allotment, the lands were disestablished as tribal lands in the 1906 Five Tribes Act and 1906 Oklahoma Enabling Act, enacted just prior to Oklahoma gaining statehood in 1907. The Court ruled in a 5-4 vote that, per the Major Crimes Act, land reserved for the Creek Nation in eastern Oklahoma remained an Indian territory (it was not ever disestablished) and hence the conviction and sentencing were overturned.

[.my2]
麦克吉尔特诉俄克拉荷马州案 ，591 US 894 (2020)。 本案涉及俄克拉荷马州是否有权在其指定的部落土地上对美洲原住民罪犯进行定罪。吉姆西·麦克吉尔特（穆斯科吉[克里克]族成员）被俄克拉荷马州以在克里克族历史土地上实施的儿童性犯罪定罪。原告辩称，根据 1885 年《印第安人重大犯罪法》和其他确立克里克族土地的联邦法律，美国联邦政府而非俄克拉荷马州应拥有管辖权。俄克拉荷马州辩称，在土地分配之后，根据 1906 年《五部落法案》和 1906 年《俄克拉荷马州建州法案》（这两部法案在俄克拉荷马州于 1907 年建州前夕颁布），这些土地已被取消部落土地的地位。法院以 5 比 4 的投票结果裁定，根据《重大犯罪法案》，俄克拉荷马州东部为克里克族保留的土地仍然是印第安领地（从未被取消），因此，定罪和量刑被推翻。

Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). When Ernesto Miranda was arrested, interrogated, and confessed to kidnapping in 1963, the arresting officers neglected to inform him of his Fifth Amendment right not to self-incriminate. After being found guilty at trial, Miranda appealed to the Supreme Court, insisting that the officers violated his Fifth Amendment rights. The 5–4 decision in Miranda v. Arizona found that the right to not incriminate oneself relies heavily on the suspect’s right to be informed of these rights at the time of arrest. The opinion indicated that suspects must be told that they have the right to an attorney and the right to remain silent in order to ensure that any statements they provide are issued voluntarily.

[.my2]
米兰达诉亚利桑那州案 ，384 US 436 (1966)。 1963 年，埃内斯托·米兰达被捕、接受审讯并承认绑架罪时，逮捕他的警官没有告知他受美国宪法第五修正案保护的不自证其罪的权利。米兰达在审判中被判有罪后，向最高法院提起上诉，坚称警官侵犯了他的第五修正案权利。在米兰达诉亚利桑那州案中，最高法院以 5 比 4 的投票结果裁定，不自证其罪的权利很大程度上取决于嫌疑人在被捕时是否被告知这些权利。该判决指出，必须告知嫌疑人他们有权聘请律师和保持沉默，以确保他们提供的任何陈述都是自愿的。

National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519 (2012). This case represented a challenge to the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The suing states argued that the Medicare expansion and the individual mandate that required citizens to purchase health insurance or pay a fine were both unconstitutional. The 5–4 decision found that the Medicare expansion was permissible, but that the federal government could not withhold all Medicare funding for states that refused to accept the expansion. More importantly, it found that Congress had the power to apply the mandate to purchase health insurance under its enumerated power to tax.

[.my2]
全国独立企业联合会诉塞贝柳斯案 ，567 US 519 (2012)。 本案挑战了《患者保护与平价医疗法案》的合宪性。提起诉讼的各州认为，医疗保险的扩容以及强制公民购买医疗保险或缴纳罚款的个人强制条款均违宪。最终以 5 比 4 的投票结果裁定，医疗保险的扩容合法，但联邦政府无权扣留拒绝接受扩容的各州的全部医疗保险资金。更重要的是，裁决认定，国会有权根据其列举的征税权，强制公民购买医疗保险。

New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964). This case began when the New York Times published a full-page advertisement claiming that the arrest of Martin Luther King, Jr. in Alabama was part of a concerted effort to ruin him. Insulted, an Alabama official filed a libel suit against the newspaper. Under Alabama law, which did not require that persons claiming libel have to show harm, the official won a judgment. The New York Times appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the ruling violated its First Amendment right to free speech. In a unanimous decision, the court declared that the First Amendment protects even false statements by the press, as long as those statements are not made with actual malice.

[.my2]
纽约时报诉沙利文案 ，376 US 254 (1964)。 本案缘起于 《纽约时报》 刊登了一则整版广告，声称马丁·路德·金在阿拉巴马州的被捕是蓄意陷害他的一部分。一位阿拉巴马州官员对此感到愤慨，遂对该报提起诽谤诉讼。根据阿拉巴马州法律，诽谤诉讼无需原告证明其受到损害，因此该官员胜诉。《 纽约时报》 不服，向最高法院提起上诉，认为该判决侵犯了其受宪法第一修正案保护的言论自由权。最高法院一致裁定，只要并非出于恶意，即使新闻媒体发表虚假言论，也受宪法第一修正案保护。

Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644 (2015). This case concerned groups of same-sex couples who brought suits against a number of states and relevant agencies that refused to recognize same-sex marriages created in states where such marriages were legal. In the 5–4 decision, the court found that not only did the Fourteenth Amendment provision for equal protection under the law require that states recognize same-sex marriages formed in other states, but that no state could deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples if they also issued them to other types of couples.

[.my2]
奥贝格费尔诉霍奇斯案 ，576 US 644 (2015)。 本案涉及一些同性伴侣团体，他们起诉多个州及其相关机构，指控其拒绝承认在其他州缔结的同性婚姻。在 5 比 4 的裁决中，法院认为，第十四修正案关于法律面前人人平等的规定不仅要求各州承认在其他州缔结的同性婚姻，而且任何州都不得在向其他类型伴侣颁发结婚证的情况下，拒绝向同性伴侣颁发结婚证。

Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896). When Homer Plessy, a man of mixed racial heritage, sat in a Whites-only railroad car in an attempt to challenge a Louisiana law that required railroad cars be segregated, he was arrested and convicted. Appealing his conviction to the Supreme Court, he argued that the segregation law was a violation of the principle of equal protection under the law in the Fourteenth Amendment. In a 7–1 decision, the court disagreed, indicating that the law was not a violation of the equal protection principle because the different train cars were separate but equal. Plessy v. Ferguson’s “separate but equal” remained a guiding principle of segregation until Brown v. Board of Education (1954).

普莱西诉弗格森案 ，163 US 537 (1896)。 霍默·普莱西是一位混血儿，他为了挑战路易斯安那州一项要求铁路车厢实行种族隔离的法律，坐在了仅限白人乘坐的车厢里，结果被捕并被定罪。他向最高法院提起上诉，辩称该种族隔离法违反了第十四修正案中关于法律面前人人平等的原则。最高法院以 7 比 1 的投票结果驳回了普莱西的上诉，认为该法律并未违反平等保护原则，因为不同的车厢虽然隔离，但彼此平等。普莱西诉弗格森案中确立的“隔离但平等”原则，在布朗诉教育委员会案 （1954）之前，一直是种族隔离制度的指导原则。

Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973). This case involved a pregnant woman from Texas who desired to terminate her pregnancy. At the time, Texas only allowed abortions in cases where the woman’s life was in danger. Using the pseudonym “Jane Roe,” the woman appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Constitution provides women the right to terminate an abortion. The 7–2 decision in Roe v. Wade sided with the plaintiff and declared that the right to privacy upheld in the decision in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) included a woman’s right to an abortion. In balancing the rights of the woman with the interests of the states to protect human life, the court created a trimester framework. In the first trimester, a pregnant woman could seek an abortion without restriction. In the second and third trimesters, however, the court asserted that states had an interest in regulating abortions, provided that those regulations were based on health needs. The 2023 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health decision overruled the 1973 decision.

罗诉韦德案 ，410 US 113 (1973)。 本案涉及一位来自德克萨斯州的孕妇，她希望终止妊娠。当时，德克萨斯州只允许在孕妇生命受到威胁的情况下进行堕胎。这位化名为“简·罗”的女子向最高法院提起上诉，主张宪法赋予女性终止妊娠的权利。 罗诉韦德案以 7 比 2 的投票结果支持原告，并宣布在格里斯沃尔德诉康涅狄格州案（1965）中确立的隐私权包含了女性的堕胎权。为了平衡女性的权利与各州保护人类生命的利益，法院设立了妊娠三阶段框架。在妊娠早期，孕妇可以不受限制地寻求堕胎。然而，在妊娠中期和晚期，法院认为各州有权对堕胎进行监管，前提是这些监管必须基于健康需要。 2023 年 Dobbs 诉 Jackson Women's Health 一案的判决推翻了 1973 年的判决。

Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 (2013). After decades in which African Americans encountered obstacles to voting, particularly in southern states, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Among other things, the law prohibited certain congressional districts from changing election laws without federal authorization. In 2010, Shelby County in Alabama brought a suit against the U.S. attorney general, claiming that both section five of the act, which required districts to seek preapproval, and section four, which determined which districts had to seek preapproval, were unconstitutional. In a 5–4 decision, the court found that both sections violated the Tenth Amendment.

谢尔比县诉霍尔德案 ，570 US 529 (2013)。 在非裔美国人，尤其是在南部各州，数十年来投票权一直受到阻碍之后，国会于 1965 年通过了《投票权法案》。该法案除其他事项外，禁止某些国会选区在未经联邦授权的情况下更改选举法。2010 年，阿拉巴马州谢尔比县起诉美国司法部长，声称该法案的第五条（要求各选区事先获得批准）和第四条（确定哪些选区必须事先获得批准）均违宪。最高法院以 5 比 4 的投票结果裁定，这两条均违反了宪法第十修正案。

Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. Harvard, 600 U.S. 81 (2023). This case reversed prior Supreme Court rulings pertaining to affirmative action in college admissions. In the case the Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. brought suit against Harvard University claiming that its undergraduate admission policies discriminated against Asian Americans. Voting 6-2 in the Harvard case (and 6-3 in the companion SFFA v. University of North Carolina case, which focused on discrimination against both Asian Americans and whites), the court ruled that affirmative action in college admissions is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

学生公平录取组织诉哈佛大学案 ，600 US 81 (2023)。 该案推翻了最高法院此前关于大学招生中平权行动的裁决。在该案中，学生公平录取组织起诉哈佛大学，声称其本科招生政策歧视亚裔美国人。 最高法院在哈佛案中以 6 比 2 的投票结果（以及在另一起涉及对亚裔美国人和白人双重歧视的案件——学生公平录取组织诉北卡罗来纳大学案中以 6 比 3 的投票结果）裁定，大学招生中的平权行动违反了美国宪法第十四修正案的平等保护条款。

Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593 (2024). This case pertained to the definition of presidential immunity from criminal prosecution after a president has left office. The first of its kind case resulted from a federal investigation into actions by then President Donald J. Trump, including potential election tampering and involvement in a violent takeover of the U.S. Capitol building on January 6, 2021 to stop the formal certification of the 2020 election. The Former President, who was elected to the presidency again in 2024, was indicted in August 2023 on four counts related to the January 6th attack. Trump claimed presidential immunity and argued that prosecution may only follow impeachment by the U.S. House and conviction by the U.S. Senate. In a 6-3 decision, the Court ruled that presidential immunity from criminal prosecution is absolute for core powers delineated in the Constitution (e.g. pardons, role as commander in chief) and presumptively extends to all of a president’s official acts (many of which involve shared authority with Congress) understanding the latter can be the subject of prosecution. The court further clarified that unofficial acts by a president do not enjoy presidential immunity.

特朗普诉美国案 ，603 US 593 (2024)。 本案涉及总统卸任后免于刑事起诉的豁免权定义。这是首例此类案件，源于联邦政府对时任总统唐纳德·J·特朗普行为的调查，包括潜在的选举舞弊以及参与 2021 年 1 月 6 日暴力占领美国国会大厦以阻止 2020 年大选正式认证的行动。这位前总统于 2024 年再次当选总统，并于 2023 年 8 月因与 1 月 6 日袭击事件相关的四项罪名被起诉。特朗普声称享有总统豁免权，并辩称只有在众议院弹劾并经参议院定罪后才能对其提起诉讼。最高法院以 6 比 3 的投票结果裁定，总统享有刑事豁免权，该豁免权适用于宪法规定的核心权力（例如赦免、三军统帅职责），并推定适用于总统的所有官方行为（其中许多行为涉及与国会的共同权力），但国会的行为本身也可能受到起诉。法院进一步明确，总统的非官方行为不享有总统豁免权。

United States v. Windsor, 570 U.S. 744 (2013). When Thea Clara Spyer died in 2009, she left her estate to her wife, Edith Windsor, with whom she had been legally married in Canada years before. Because of a 1996 U.S. law called the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), this marriage was not recognized by the federal government. As a result, Windsor was compelled to pay an enormous tax on the inheritance, which she would not have had to pay had the federal government recognized the marriage. Appealing to the Supreme Court, Windsor argued that DOMA was unconstitutional because it deprives same-sex couples of their Fifth Amendment right to equal protection. In the 5–4 decision, the court agreed with Windsor, stating that DOMA was intended to treat certain married couples differently in blatant violation of their Fifth Amendment rights.

美国诉温莎案 ，570 US 744 (2013)。 2009 年西娅·克拉拉·斯派尔去世后，将遗产留给了她的妻子伊迪丝·温莎。多年前，她们在加拿大合法结婚。由于 1996 年美国通过的《婚姻保护法》（DOMA），联邦政府不承认这段婚姻。因此，温莎被迫为这笔遗产缴纳巨额税款，而如果联邦政府承认这段婚姻，她本不必缴纳这笔税款。温莎向最高法院提起上诉，认为 DOMA 违宪，因为它剥夺了同性伴侣受美国宪法第五修正案保护的平等权利。最高法院以 5 比 4 的投票结果支持温莎的观点，认为 DOMA 旨在区别对待某些已婚伴侣，公然侵犯了他们受第五修正案保护的权利。
