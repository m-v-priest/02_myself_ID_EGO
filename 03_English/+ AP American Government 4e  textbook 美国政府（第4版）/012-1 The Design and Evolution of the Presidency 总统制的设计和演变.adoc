== 释义




Since its invention at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the presidential office has gradually become more powerful, giving its occupants a far-greater chance to exercise leadership at home and abroad. The role of the chief executive has changed over time, as various presidents have confronted challenges in domestic and foreign policy in times of war as well as peace, and as the power of the federal government has grown.

自1787年制宪会议设立以来，总统职位权力逐渐增强，使其在国内外拥有更大的领导权。随着历任总统在战时和和平时期应对国内外政策挑战，以及联邦政府权力的增长，总统的角色也随之发生了变化。

INVENTING THE PRESIDENCY
总统制的创立
The Articles of Confederation made no provision for an executive branch, although they did use the term “president” to designate the presiding officer of the Confederation Congress, who also handled other administrative duties.1 The presidency was proposed early in the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia by Virginia’s Edmund Randolph, as part of James Madison’s proposal for a federal government, which became known as the Virginia Plan. Madison offered a rather sketchy outline of the executive branch, leaving open whether what he termed the “national executive” would be an individual or a set of people. He proposed that Congress select the executive, whose powers and authority, and even length of term of service, were left largely undefined. He also proposed a “council of revision” consisting of the national executive and members of the national judiciary, which would review laws passed by the legislature and have the power of veto.2
《邦联条例》 并未对行政部门作出规定，尽管它确实使用了“总统”一词来指代邦联国会的议长，该议长也兼任其他行政职务。 1 总统制是由弗吉尼亚州的埃德蒙·伦道夫在费城制宪会议初期提出的，这是詹姆斯·麦迪逊提出的联邦政府方案的一部分，该方案后来被称为“ 弗吉尼亚方案 ”。 麦迪逊对行政部门的构想相当粗略，并未明确他所谓的“国家行政长官”究竟是个人还是一个团体。他提议由国会选举行政长官，但行政长官的权力、权限，甚至任期，都未作具体规定。他还提议设立一个由国家行政长官和国家司法机构成员组成的“修订委员会”，该委员会将审查立法机关通过的法律，并拥有否决权。 2

Early deliberations produced agreement that the executive would be a single person, elected for a single term of seven years by the legislature, empowered to veto legislation, and subject to impeachment and removal by the legislature. New Jersey’s William Paterson offered an alternate model as part of his proposal, typically referred to as the small-state or New Jersey Plan. This plan called for merely amending the Articles of Confederation to allow for an executive branch made up of a committee elected by a unicameral Congress for a single term. Under this proposal, the executive committee would be particularly weak because it could be removed from power at any point if a majority of state governors so desired. Far more extreme was Alexander Hamilton’s suggestion that the executive power be entrusted to a single individual. This individual would be chosen by electors, would serve for life, and would exercise broad powers, including the ability to veto legislation, the power to negotiate treaties and grant pardons in all cases except treason, and the duty to serve as commander-in-chief of the armed forces (Figure 12.2).

[.my2]
早期讨论达成共识，行政长官应由一人担任，由立法机关选举产生，任期七年，拥有否决权，并受立法机关弹劾和罢免。新泽西州的威廉· 帕特森在其提案中提出了另一种模式，通常被称为小州方案或新泽西方案 。该方案仅需修改《邦联条例》，允许设立一个由一院制国会选举产生的委员会，任期一年。根据该方案，行政委员会的权力将非常薄弱，因为如果多数州长愿意，随时可以将其罢免。更为极端的是亚历山大·汉密尔顿的建议，即行政权应授予一人。此人将由选民选出，终身任职，并拥有广泛的权力，包括否决立法的权力、谈判条约的权力、除叛国罪外赦免所有人的权力，以及担任武装部队总司令的职责（ 图 12.2 ）。

图 12.2 亚历山大 ·汉密尔顿 (a) 曾在美国独立战争期间在乔治· 华盛顿将军 (b) 手下任职，他在 《联邦党人文集》 第 70 篇中主张设立强有力的行政机构。事实上， 《联邦党人文集》 中还有十篇讨论了总统的作用。
Debate and discussion continued throughout the summer. Delegates eventually settled upon a single executive, but they remained at a loss for how to select that person. Pennsylvania’s James Wilson, who had triumphed on the issue of a single executive, at first proposed the direct election of the president. When delegates rejected that idea, he responded with the suggestion that electors, chosen throughout the nation, should select the executive. Over time, Wilson’s idea gained ground with delegates who were uneasy at the idea of an election by the legislature, which presented the opportunity for intrigue and corruption. The idea of a shorter term of service combined with eligibility for reelection also became more attractive to delegates. The framers of the Constitution struggled to find the proper balance between giving the president the power to perform the job on one hand and opening the way for a president to abuse power and act like a monarch on the other.

[.my2]
整个夏天，辩论和讨论持续不断。代表们最终决定设立单一行政长官，但如何选出这位人选却让他们束手无策。宾夕法尼亚州的詹姆斯·威尔逊在设立单一行政长官的问题上取得了胜利，他最初提议由选举人直接选举总统。当代表们否决了这一提议后，他又建议由全国各地选出的选举人团来选举总统。随着时间的推移，威尔逊的提议逐渐被代表们接受，因为他们对由立法机构选举总统感到不安，认为这容易滋生阴谋和腐败。缩短任期并允许连任的方案也越来越受到代表们的青睐。宪法的制定者们努力寻求一种平衡，一方面赋予总统履行职责的权力，另一方面又避免总统滥用权力，像君主一样行事。

By early September, the Electoral College had emerged as the way to select a president for four years who was eligible for reelection. This process is discussed more fully in the chapter on elections. Today, the Electoral College consists of a body of 538 people called electors, each representing one of the fifty states or the District of Columbia, who formally cast votes for the election of the president and vice president (Figure 12.3). In forty-eight states and the District of Columbia, the candidate who wins the popular vote in November receives all the state’s electoral votes. In two states, Nebraska and Maine, the electoral votes are divided: The candidate who wins the popular vote in the state gets two electoral votes, but the winner of each congressional district also receives an electoral vote.

[.my2]
到 9 月初， 选举人团制度已成为选出任期四年、可连任总统的制度。关于这一过程，在选举章节中有更详细的讨论。如今，选举人团由 538 名被称为选举人的代表组成，每位选举人代表五十个州或哥伦比亚特区中的一个，他们正式投票选举总统和副总统（ 图 12.3 ）。在 48 个州和哥伦比亚特区，11 月赢得普选的候选人将获得该州的所有选举人票。在内布拉斯加州和缅因州，选举人票被分配：在该州赢得普选的候选人获得两张选举人票，但每个国会选区的获胜者也将获得一张选举人票。

In alphabetical order, Alabama has 9, Alaska has 3, Arizona has 11, Arkansas has 6, California has 54, Colorado has 10, Connecticut has 7, Delaware has 3, Washington DC has 3, Florida has 30, Georgia has 16, Hawaii has 4, Idaho has 4, Illinois has 19, Indiana has 11, Iowa has 6, Kansas has 6, Kentucky has 8, Louisiana has 8, Maine has 4, Maryland has 10, Massachusetts has 11, Michigan has 15, Minnesota has 10, Mississippi has 6, Missouri has 10, Montana has 4, Nebraska has 5, Nevada has 6, New Hampshire has 4, New Jersey has 14, New Mexico has 5, New York has 28, North Carolina has 16, North Dakota has 3, Ohio has 17, Oklahoma has 7, Oregon has 8, Pennsylvania has 19, Rhode Island has 4, South Carolina has 9, South Dakota has 3, Tennessee has 11, Texas has 40, Utah has 6, Vermont has 3, Virginia has 13, Washington has 12, West Virginia has 4, Wisconsin has 10, and Wyoming has 3.

[.my2]
Figure 12.3 This map shows the distribution by state of delegate votes available in the 2024 national election. The number of Electoral College votes granted to each state equals the total number of representatives and senators that state has in the U.S. Congress or, in the case of Washington, DC, as many electors as it would have if it were a state. The number of representatives may fluctuate based on state population, which is determined every ten years by the U.S. Census.

[.my2]
图 12.3 此图显示了 2024 年全国大选中各州代表票的分布情况。各州获得的选举人票数等于该州在美国国会的众议员和参议员总数；如果是华盛顿特区，则等于其作为州时所拥有的选举人票数。众议员人数可能根据各州人口数量而有所波动，而各州人口数量由美国人口普查局每十年统计一次。
In the original design implemented for the first four presidential elections (1788–89, 1792, 1796, and 1800), the electors cast two ballots (but only one could go to a candidate from the elector’s state), and the person who received a majority won the election. The second-place finisher became vice president. Should no candidate receive a majority of the votes cast, the House of Representatives would select the president, with each state casting a single vote, while the Senate chose the vice president.

[.my2]
在最初四届总统选举（1788-89年、1792年、1796年和1800年）中实施的选举制度下，选举人投两票（但只有一票可以投给来自该选举人所在州的候选人），得票最多的候选人当选。得票第二多的候选人当选副总统。如果没有候选人获得过半数选票，则由众议院选举总统，每个州投一票；参议院选举副总统。

While George Washington was elected president twice with this approach, the design resulted in controversy in both the 1796 and 1800 elections. In 1796, John Adams won the presidency, while his opponent and political rival Thomas Jefferson was elected vice president. In 1800, Thomas Jefferson and his running mate Aaron Burr finished tied in the Electoral College. Jefferson was elected president in the House of Representatives on the thirty-sixth ballot. These controversies led to the proposal and ratification of the Twelfth Amendment, which couples a particular presidential candidate with that candidate’s running mate in a unified ticket.3
虽然乔治·华盛顿曾两次凭借这种方式当选总统，但这种设计在 1796 年和 1800 年的选举中都引发了争议。1796 年，约翰·亚当斯赢得总统大选，而他的对手兼政治对手托马斯·杰斐逊则当选副总统。1800 年，托马斯·杰斐逊和他的竞选伙伴阿伦·伯尔在选举人团中得票相同 。 杰斐逊在众议院第三十六轮投票中当选总统。这些争议促成了第十二修正案的提出和批准，该修正案规定总统候选人与其竞选伙伴组成统一的竞选组合。

For the last two centuries or so, the Twelfth Amendment has worked fairly well. But this doesn’t mean the arrangement is foolproof. For example, the amendment created a separate ballot for the vice president but left the rules for electors largely intact. One of those rules states that the two votes the electors cast cannot both be for “an inhabitant of the same state with themselves.”4 This rule means that an elector from, say, Louisiana, could not cast votes for a presidential candidate and a vice presidential candidate who were both from Louisiana; that elector could vote for only one of these people. The intent of the rule was to encourage electors from powerful states to look for a more diverse pool of candidates. But what would happen in a close election where the members of the winning ticket were both from the same state?
在过去两百年左右的时间里，第十二修正案运行得相当不错。但这并不意味着这种安排万无一失。例如，该修正案为副总统设立了单独的选票，但基本保留了选举人规则。其中一条规则规定，选举人投出的两张选票不能同时投给“与自己来自同一州的候选人”。⁴ 这条规则意味着，例如，一位来自路易斯安那州的选举人不能同时投票给一位来自路易斯安那州的总统候选人和一位来自路易斯安那州的副总统候选人；这位选举人只能投其中一人的票。这条规则的目的是鼓励来自实力较强州的选举人选择更多元化的候选人。但是，如果选举结果接近，而获胜的两位候选人都来自同一州，又该怎么办呢？

The nation almost found out in 2000. In the presidential election of that year, the Republican ticket won the election by a very narrow electoral margin. To win the presidency or vice presidency, a candidate must get 270 electoral votes (a majority). George W. Bush and Dick Cheney won by the skin of their teeth with just 271. Both, however, were living in Texas. This should have meant that Texas’s 32 electoral votes could have gone to only one or the other. Cheney anticipated this problem and had earlier registered to vote in Wyoming, where he was originally from and where he had served as a representative years earlier.5 It’s hard to imagine that the 2000 presidential election could have been even more complicated than it was, but thanks to that seemingly innocuous rule in Article II of the Constitution, that was a real possibility.

[.my2]
2000 年，美国几乎就亲身经历了这一幕。在那年的总统选举中，共和党候选人以微弱优势险胜。要赢得总统或副总统职位，候选人必须获得 270 张选举人票（过半数）。乔治·W· 布什和迪克·切尼仅以 271 张选举人票险胜。然而，两人都居住在德克萨斯州 。这意味着德克萨斯州的 32 张选举人票只能投给他们中的一人。切尼预料到了这个问题，因此早先在怀俄明州登记投票。怀俄明州是他的故乡，他多年前也曾担任过该州的众议员。很难想象 2000 年的总统选举还能比现在更加复杂，但由于宪法第二条中那条看似无关紧要的规定， 这种情况并非不可能。

Despite provisions for the election of a vice president (to serve in case of the president’s death, resignation, or removal through the impeachment process), and apart from the suggestion that the vice president should be responsible for presiding over the Senate, the framers left the vice president’s role undeveloped. As a result, the influence of the vice presidency has varied dramatically, depending on how much of a role the vice president is given by the president. Some vice presidents, such as Dan Quayle under President George H. W. Bush, serve a mostly ceremonial function, while others, like Dick Cheney under President George W. Bush, become a partner in governance and rival the White House chief of staff in terms of influence.

[.my2]
尽管宪法规定了副总统的选举（以备总统去世、辞职或被弹劾罢免时继任），并且除了建议副总统主持参议院会议之外，制宪者并未对副总统的角色进行深入阐述。因此，副总统的影响力差异巨大，取决于总统赋予副总统的权力大小。一些副总统，例如老布什总统时期的丹·奎尔，主要履行礼仪性职责；而另一些副总统，例如小布什总统时期的迪克·切尼，则成为政府的合作伙伴，其影响力甚至可以与白宫幕僚长相匹敌。

了解詹姆斯·麦迪逊对总统制和选举团制度不断变化的看法 。

In addition to describing the process of election for the presidency and vice presidency, the delegates to the Constitutional Convention also outlined who was eligible for election and how Congress might remove the president. Article II of the Constitution lays out the agreed-upon requirements—the chief executive must be at least thirty-five years old and a “natural born” citizen of the United States (or a citizen at the time of the Constitution’s adoption) who has been an inhabitant of the United States for at least fourteen years.6 While Article II also states that the term of office is four years and does not expressly limit the number of times a person might be elected president, after Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected four times (from 1932 to 1944), the Twenty-Second Amendment was proposed and ratified, limiting the presidency to two four-year terms.

[.my2]
除了阐述总统和副总统的选举程序外，制宪会议的代表们还概述了谁有资格当选以及国会如何罢免总统。宪法第二条规定了各方商定的资格要求——国家元首必须年满 35 岁，并且是美国“出生公民”（或在宪法通过时已是美国公民），且在美国居住至少 14 年。 6 虽然第二条也规定总统任期为四年，并且没有明确限制一个人可以当选总统的次数，但在富兰克林· 罗斯福四次当选总统（1932 年至 1944 年）之后，第二十二修正案被提出并获得批准，将总统任期限制为两届，每届四年。

An important means of ensuring that no president could become tyrannical was to build into the Constitution a clear process for removing the chief executive—impeachment. Impeachment is the act of charging a government official with serious wrongdoing; the Constitution calls this wrongdoing high crimes and misdemeanors. The method the framers designed required two steps and both chambers of the Congress. First, the House of Representatives could impeach the president by a simple majority vote. In the second step, the Senate could remove the president from office by a two-thirds majority, with the chief justice of the Supreme Court presiding over the trial. Upon conviction and removal of the president, if that occurred, the vice president would become president.

[.my2]
确保总统不会成为暴君的重要手段之一是在宪法中设立明确的罢免总统程序 ——弹劾 。弹劾是指指控政府官员犯有严重不当行为；宪法将此类不当行为称为重罪和轻罪。制宪者设计的弹劾程序需要两个步骤，并且需要国会两院的参与。首先，众议院可以以简单多数票弹劾总统。其次，参议院可以以三分之二多数票罢免总统，由最高法院首席大法官主持审判。如果总统被定罪并被罢免，副总统将继任总统。

Four presidents have faced impeachment proceedings in the House; none has been both impeached by the House and removed by the Senate. In the wake of the Civil War, President Andrew Johnson faced congressional contempt for decisions made during Reconstruction. President Richard Nixon faced an overwhelming likelihood of impeachment in the House for his cover-up of key information relating to the 1972 break-in at the Democratic Party’s campaign headquarters at the Watergate hotel and apartment complex. Nixon likely would have also been removed by the Senate, since there was strong bipartisan consensus for his impeachment and removal. Instead, he resigned before the House and Senate could exercise their constitutional prerogatives.

[.my2]
历史上共有四位总统在众议院面临弹劾程序；但没有一位总统同时被众议院弹劾并被参议院罢免。内战结束后，安德鲁· 约翰逊总统因其在重建时期做出的决策而面临国会的藐视国会罪指控。理查德· 尼克松总统因掩盖 1972 年民主党竞选总部（位于水门酒店和公寓大楼内）遭闯入事件的关键信息，极有可能在众议院遭到弹劾。由于两党在弹劾和罢免方面达成了强烈的共识，尼克松很可能也会被参议院罢免。然而，在众议院和参议院行使宪法赋予的权力之前，他选择了辞职。

The 1990s brought the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, brought on by his lying about an extramarital affair with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. Voting fell largely along party lines. House Republicans felt the affair and Clinton’s initial public denial of it rose to a level of wrongdoing worthy of impeachment. House Democrats believed it fell short of an impeachable offense and that a simply censure made better sense. Clinton's trial in the Senate went nowhere because too few Senators wanted to move forward with removing the president.

[.my2]
20 世纪 90 年代，比尔 ·克林顿总统因与白宫实习生莫妮卡·莱温斯基的婚外情撒谎而遭到弹劾。投票结果基本按党派划分。众议院共和党人认为，莱温斯基的婚外情以及他最初公开否认的行为构成足以弹劾的罪行。众议院民主党人则认为，这还不足以构成弹劾罪，简单的谴责更为合适。由于支持罢免总统的参议员人数太少，克林顿在参议院的审判最终无疾而终。

The most recent impeachments were of President Donald Trump, who was impeached in the House twice. However, support for removal in the Senate did not meet the super-majority requirement, although on the second attempt in 2021 a solid majority favored removal. The first Trump impeachment brought charges of “abuse of power” and “obstruction of Congress” related to allegations that he improperly used his office to seek help from Ukrainian officials to facilitate his re-election. The second Trump impeachment was for “incitement of insurrection” related to the attack on the U.S. Capitol building during the counting of Electoral College votes on January 6, 2021. This second impeachment led to Republicans supporting impeachment in the House, including Representative Liz Cheney (R-WY), one of the central party leaders, and removal in the Senate, including Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT).7 Ongoing federal investigations of the insurrection continued, and an attempt to launch an independent commission to investigate the event (similar to the 9/11 commission) passed the House, but was blocked by Republicans in the Senate.8
最近一次弹劾案针对的是唐纳德·特朗普总统，他曾两次在众议院遭到弹劾。然而，尽管在 2021 年的第二次弹劾中，参议院的多数票支持罢免，但最终未能达到绝对多数的要求。特朗普的第一次弹劾指控他“滥用职权”和“妨碍国会”，理由是他涉嫌不当利用职权寻求乌克兰官员的帮助以助其连任。特朗普的第二次弹劾指控他“煽动叛乱”，与 2021 年 1 月 6 日美国国会大厦在计票期间遭受的袭击有关。第二次弹劾导致众议院的共和党议员支持弹劾，其中包括共和党核心领导人之一、怀俄明州众议员利兹·切尼；参议院也支持罢免，其中包括犹他州参议员米特·罗姆尼。 7. 联邦政府对暴乱的调查仍在继续，一项成立独立委员会调查该事件（类似于 9/11 事件调查委员会）的提案在众议院获得通过，但遭到参议院共和党人的阻挠。8 .

Looking across the span of U.S. history, impeachment of a president remains a rare event indeed and removal has never occurred. However, with three of the five impeachment trials having occurred in the last twenty-five years, and with two of the five most recent presidents having faced impeachment, it will be interesting to watch if the trend continues in our partisan era. The fact that a president could be impeached and removed is an important reminder of the role of the executive in the broader system of shared powers. The same outcome occurred in the case of Andrew Johnson in the nineteenth century though he came closer to the threshold of votes needed for removal than did Clinton.

[.my2]
纵观美国历史，总统弹劾案实属罕见，总统被罢免的情况更是从未发生过。然而，五次弹劾审判中有三次发生在过去二十五年间，而最近五位总统中有两位面临弹劾，因此，在当今党派纷争激烈的时代，这一趋势是否会延续，值得我们关注。总统可能被弹劾并罢免这一事实，有力地提醒我们行政部门在更广泛的权力共享体系中扮演着重要角色。十九世纪安德鲁·约翰逊的弹劾案也曾出现过类似的结果，尽管他当时获得的弹劾票数比克林顿更接近罢免所需的门槛。

The Constitution that emerged from the deliberations in Philadelphia treated the powers of the presidency in concise fashion. The president was to be commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the United States, negotiate treaties with the advice and consent of the Senate, and receive representatives of foreign nations (Figure 12.4). Charged to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” the president was given broad power to pardon those convicted of federal offenses, except for officials removed through the impeachment process.9 The chief executive would present to Congress information about the state of the union; call Congress into session when needed; veto legislation if necessary, although a two-thirds supermajority in both houses of Congress could override that veto; and make recommendations for legislation and policy as well as call on the heads of various departments to make reports and offer opinions.

在费城会议审议后形成的宪法对总统权力作出了简洁明了的规定。总统是美国武装部队的总司令 ，在参议院的建议和同意下进行条约谈判，并接待外国代表（ 图 12.4 ）。总统的职责是“确保法律得到忠实执行”，并被赋予广泛的权力，可以赦免被判犯有联邦罪行的人，但通过弹劾程序被免职的官员除外。 9 总统将向国会提交有关国家状况的信息；在必要时召集国会开会；在必要时否决立法，但国会两院三分之二的绝对多数票可以推翻总统的否决；并就立法和政策提出建议，以及要求各部门负责人提交报告和发表意见。

Finally, the president’s job included nominating federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, as well as other federal officials, and making appointments to fill military and diplomatic posts. The number of judicial appointments and nominations of other federal officials is great. In recent decades, two-term presidents have nominated well over three hundred federal judges while in office.10 Moreover, new presidents nominate close to five hundred top officials to their Executive Office of the President, key agencies (such as the Department of Justice), and regulatory commissions (such as the Federal Reserve Board), whose appointments require Senate majority approval.11
最后，总统的职责还包括提名联邦法官（包括最高法院大法官）和其他联邦官员，以及任命军事和外交职位。司法任命和其他联邦官员的提名数量庞大。近几十年来，连任两届的总统在任期间提名了超过三百名联邦法官。 10 此外，新任总统还会提名近五百名高级官员进入总统行政办公室、关键机构（例如司法部）和监管委员会（例如联邦储备委员会），这些任命需要参议院多数票批准。 11

THE EVOLVING EXECUTIVE BRANCH
不断演变的行政部门
No sooner had the presidency been established than the occupants of the office, starting with George Washington, began acting in ways that expanded both its formal and informal powers. For example, Washington established a cabinet or group of advisors to help him administer his duties, consisting of the most senior appointed officers of the executive branch. Today, the heads of the fifteen executive departments serve as the president’s advisers.12 And, in 1793, when it became important for the United States to take a stand in the evolving European conflicts between France and other European powers, especially Great Britain, Washington issued a neutrality proclamation that extended his rights as diplomat-in-chief far more broadly than had at first been conceived.

[.my2]
总统制设立之初，历任总统，从乔治 ·华盛顿开始，便着手扩大总统的正式和非正式权力。例如，华盛顿设立了内阁或顾问团来协助他履行职责，内阁成员由行政部门最高级别的官员组成。如今，十五个行政部门的首长都担任总统顾问。 12 1793 年，随着法国与其他欧洲列强（尤其是英国）之间冲突的加剧，美国必须表明立场，华盛顿发布了中立宣言，使其作为首席外交官的权力远超最初的设想。

Later presidents built on the foundation of these powers. Some waged undeclared wars, as John Adams did against the French in the Quasi-War (1798–1800). Others agreed to negotiate for significant territorial gains, as Thomas Jefferson did when he oversaw the purchase of Louisiana from France. Concerned that he might be violating the powers of the office, Jefferson rationalized that his not facing impeachment charges constituted Congress’s tacit approval of his actions. James Monroe used his annual message in 1823 to declare that the United States would consider it an intolerable act of aggression for European powers to intervene in the affairs of the nations of the Western Hemisphere. Later dubbed the Monroe Doctrine, this declaration of principles laid the foundation for the growth of American power in the twentieth century. Andrew Jackson employed the veto as a measure of policy to block legislative initiatives with which he did not agree and acted unilaterally when it came to depositing federal funds in several local banks around the country instead of in the Bank of the United States. This move changed the way vetoes would be used in the future. Jackson’s twelve vetoes were more than those of all prior presidents combined, and he issued them due to policy disagreements (their basis today) rather than as a legal tool to protect against encroachments by Congress on the president’s powers.

[.my2]
后来的总统们在此基础上继续发展壮大。一些总统发动了未宣战的战争，例如约翰 ·亚当斯在准战争（1798-1800）中对法发动的战争。另一些总统则同意通过谈判获得重要的领土，例如托马斯· 杰斐逊在监督从法国购买路易斯安那时所做的那样。杰斐逊担心自己可能滥用职权，但他辩解说，自己没有面临弹劾指控，就等于国会默许了他的行为。詹姆斯· 门罗在 1823 年的年度咨文中宣布，美国将视欧洲列强干涉西半球国家事务为不可容忍的侵略行为。这一原则性宣言后来被称为 “门罗主义” ，它为美国在 20 世纪的国力崛起奠定了基础。安德鲁· 杰克逊将否决权作为一种政策手段，用来阻止他不认同的立法提案。在决定将联邦资金存入全国各地的几家地方银行，而不是美国银行时，他更是单方面采取行动。这一举措改变了未来否决权的使用方式。杰克逊的十二次否决权超过了此前所有总统的总和，而且他行使否决权的原因是政策分歧（这也是如今否决权的依据），而非将其作为防止国会侵犯总统权力的法律工具。

Of the many ways in which the chief executive’s power grew over the first several decades, the most significant was the expansion of presidential war powers. While Washington, Adams, and Jefferson led the way in waging undeclared wars, it was President James K. Polk who truly set the stage for the broad growth of this authority. In 1846, as the United States and Mexico were bickering over the messy issue of where Texas’s southern border lay, Polk purposely raised anxieties and ruffled feathers through his envoy in Mexico. He then responded to the newly heightened state of affairs by sending U.S. troops to the Rio Grande, the border Texan expansionists claimed for Texas. Mexico sent troops in response, and the Mexican-American War began soon afterward.13
在最初几十年里，总统权力以多种方式扩张，其中最显著的是总统战争权力的扩大。虽然华盛顿、亚当斯和杰斐逊在发动未宣战战争方面起到了带头作用，但真正为总统权力的广泛扩张奠定基础的是詹姆斯·K· 波尔克总统。1846 年，正值美国和墨西哥就德克萨斯州南部边界的棘手问题争执不休之际，波尔克总统通过其驻墨西哥特使故意激化矛盾，激怒了墨西哥。随后，他派遣美军前往格兰德河——德克萨斯扩张主义者声称该河段属于德克萨斯——以应对局势的进一步升级。墨西哥随即出兵回应， 美墨战争很快爆发。 13

Abraham Lincoln, a member of Congress at the time, was critical of Polk’s actions. Later, however, as president himself, Lincoln used presidential war powers and the concepts of military necessity and national security to undermine the Confederate effort to seek independence for the Southern states. In suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, Lincoln blurred the boundaries between acceptable dissent and unacceptable disloyalty. He also famously used a unilateral proclamation to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, which cited the military necessity of declaring millions of enslaved people in Confederate-controlled territory to be free. His successor, Andrew Johnson, became so embroiled with Radical Republicans about ways to implement Reconstruction policies and programs after the Civil War that the House of Representatives impeached him, although the legislators in the Senate were unable to successfully remove him from office.14
当时身为国会议员的亚伯拉罕 ·林肯对波尔克的行动持批评态度。然而，后来他自己担任总统后，却利用总统的战争权力以及军事必要性和国家安全的概念，削弱了南方邦联寻求南方各州独立的努力。林肯暂停了人身保护令的特权，模糊了可接受的异议和不可接受的不忠之间的界限。他还以单方面公告的方式发布了著名的《 解放奴隶宣言》 ，该宣言援引军事必要性，宣布南方邦联控制区内数百万奴隶获得自由。他的继任者安德鲁· 约翰逊在内战后重建政策和方案的实施问题上与激进共和党人纠缠不清，以至于众议院弹劾了他，尽管参议院未能成功地将其免职。 14

Over the course of the twentieth century, presidents expanded and elaborated upon these powers. The rather vague wording in Article II, which says that the “executive power shall be vested” in the president, has been subject to broad and sweeping interpretation in order to justify actions beyond those specifically enumerated in the document.15 As the federal bureaucracy expanded, so too did the president’s power to grow agencies like the Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Presidents also further developed the concept of executive privilege, the right to withhold information from Congress, the judiciary, or the public. This right, not enumerated in the Constitution, was first asserted by George Washington to curtail inquiry into the actions of the executive branch.16 The more general defense of its use by White House officials and attorneys ensures that the president can secure candid advice from advisors and staff members.

在二十世纪，历任总统不断扩展和完善这些权力。 宪法第二条措辞含糊，规定“行政权归总统所有”，这一表述常被广泛解读，以证明总统可以采取超出宪法条文明确列举范围的行动。 15 随着联邦官僚机构的扩张，总统的权力也随之增强，得以发展壮大特勤局和联邦调查局等机构。总统们还进一步发展了行政特权的概念，即总统有权拒绝向国会、司法部门或公众披露信息。这项权利并未在宪法中明确列举，最早由乔治·华盛顿提出，旨在限制对行政部门行为的调查。 16 白宫官员和律师对这项权利的普遍辩护，确保了总统能够从顾问和幕僚那里获得坦诚的建议。

Increasingly over time, presidents have made more use of their unilateral powers, including executive orders, rules that bypass Congress but still have the force of law if the courts do not overturn them. More recently, presidents have offered their own interpretation of legislation as they sign it via signing statements (discussed later in this chapter) directed to the bureaucratic entity charged with implementation. In the realm of foreign policy, Congress permitted the widespread use of executive agreements to formalize international relations, so long as important matters still came through the Senate in the form of treaties.17 Recent presidents have continued to rely upon an ever more expansive definition of war powers to act unilaterally at home and abroad. Finally, presidents, often with Congress's blessing through the formal delegation of authority, have taken the lead in framing budgets, negotiating budget compromises, and at times impounding funds in an effort to prevail in matters of policy.

随着时间的推移，总统们越来越频繁地使用单边权力，包括行政命令 —— 这些命令绕过国会，但如果法院不推翻，仍然具有法律效力。近年来，总统们在签署法案时，会通过签署声明（本章稍后将讨论）向负责执行的官僚机构阐明他们对法案的个人解读。在外交政策领域，国会允许广泛使用行政协议来规范国际关系，只要重要事项仍然需要通过参议院以条约的形式进行表决。 17 近几任总统继续依赖日益扩大的战争权力定义，在国内和国际上采取单边行动。最后，总统们通常在国会通过正式授权的情况下，主导预算编制、预算妥协谈判，有时甚至会扣押资金，以期在政策问题上取得胜利。

Milestone  里程碑
The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921
1921年预算与会计法
Developing a budget in the nineteenth century was a chaotic mess. Unlike the case today, in which the budgeting process is centrally controlled, Congresses in the nineteenth century developed a budget in a piecemeal process. Federal agencies independently submitted budget requests to Congress, and these requests were then considered through the congressional committee process. Because the government was relatively small in the first few decades of the republic, this approach was sufficient. However, as the size and complexity of the U.S. economy grew over the course of the nineteenth century, the traditional congressional budgeting process was unable to keep up.18
十九世纪的预算编制工作一片混乱。与如今预算编制过程由中央统一控制不同，十九世纪的国会采取的是零散的预算编制方式。联邦机构各自向国会提交预算申请，然后由国会委员会进行审议。由于共和国成立之初的几十年里政府规模相对较小 ，这种方式尚可接受。然而，随着十九世纪美国经济规模和复杂性的增长，传统的国会预算编制流程已无法满足需求。

Things finally came to a head following World War I, when federal spending and debt skyrocketed. Reformers proposed the solution of putting the executive branch in charge of developing a budget that could be scrutinized, amended, and approved by Congress. However, President Woodrow Wilson, owing to a provision tacked onto the bill regarding presidential appointments, vetoed the legislation that would have transformed the budgeting process in this way. His successor, Warren Harding, felt differently and signed the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921. The act gave the president first-mover advantage in the budget process via the first “executive budget.” It also created the first-ever budget staff at the disposal of a president, at the time called the Bureau of the Budget but decades later renamed the Office of Management and Budget (Figure 12.5). With this act, Congress willingly delegated significant authority to the executive and made the president the chief budget agenda setter.

第一次世界大战后，联邦支出和债务飙升，问题最终激化。改革者提出解决方案，由行政部门负责制定预算，并由国会进行审查、修改和批准。然而，由于法案中附加了一项关于总统任命的条款，伍德罗 ·威尔逊总统否决了这项旨在改革预算流程的立法。他的继任者沃伦· 哈丁则持不同意见，并签署了 1921 年的 《预算与会计法》 。该法案通过首个“行政预算”赋予总统在预算制定过程中的先发优势。它还设立了总统专属的预算机构，当时称为预算局，但几十年后更名为管理和预算办公室（ 图 12.5 ）。通过这项法案，国会主动将重大权力下放给行政部门，使总统成为预算议程的主要制定者。

The Budget Act of 1921 effectively shifted some congressional powers to the president. Why might Congress have felt it important to centralize the budgeting process in the executive branch? What advantages could the executive branch have over the legislative branch in this regard?
1921年的《预算法》实际上将国会的部分权力转移到了总统手中。为什么国会认为将预算编制过程集中到行政部门至关重要？行政部门在这方面比立法部门有哪些优势？

The growth of presidential power is also attributable to the growth of the United States and the power of the national government. As the nation has grown and developed, so has the office. Whereas most important decisions were once made at the state and local levels, the increasing complexity and size of the domestic economy have led people in the United States to look to the federal government more often for solutions. At the same time, the rising profile of the United States on the international stage has meant that the president is a far more important figure as leader of the nation, as diplomat-in-chief, and as commander-in-chief. Finally, with the rise of electronic mass media, a president who once depended on newspapers and official documents to distribute information beyond an immediate audience can now bring that message directly to the people via radio, television, and social media. Major events and crises, such as the Great Depression, two world wars, the Cold War, and the war on terrorism, have further contributed to presidential stature.

总统权力的增长也与美国的发展和联邦政府的权力增长密切相关。随着国家的发展壮大，总统职位也随之发展。过去，大多数重要决策由州和地方政府做出，但随着国内经济日益复杂化和规模扩大，美国民众越来越倾向于向联邦政府寻求解决方案。与此同时，美国在国际舞台上地位的提升也意味着总统作为国家领导人、外交总司令以及三军统帅，其重要性与日俱增。此外，随着电子大众媒体的兴起，总统不再像过去那样依赖报纸和官方文件向更广泛的受众传播信息，而是可以通过广播、电视和社交媒体直接向民众传递信息。诸如大萧条、两次世界大战、冷战和反恐战争等重大事件和危机，也进一步提升了总统的地位。
