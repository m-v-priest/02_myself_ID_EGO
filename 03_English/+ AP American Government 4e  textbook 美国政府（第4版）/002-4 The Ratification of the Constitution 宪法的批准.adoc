== 释义




On September 17, 1787, the delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia voted to approve the document they had drafted over the course of many months. Some did not support it, but the majority did. Before it could become the law of the land, however, the Constitution faced another hurdle. It had to be ratified by the states.

[.my2]
1787 年 9 月 17 日，费城"制宪会议"的代表们, 投票通过了他们历时数月起草的宪法文件。虽然有些人反对，但大多数人赞成。然而，*在宪法成为国家法律之前，它还面临着另一个障碍：必须得到各州的批准。*

'''


=== THE RATIFICATION PROCESS

[.my2]
批准程序


Article VII, the final article of the Constitution, required that before the Constitution could become law and a new government could form, the document had to be ratified by nine of the thirteen states. Eleven days after the delegates at the Philadelphia convention approved it, copies of the Constitution were sent to each of the states, which were to hold ratifying conventions to either accept or reject it.

[.my2]
宪法第七条是宪法的最后一条，**它规定，宪法必须经十三个州中的九个州批准，才能生效成为法律，新政府才能成立。**费城制宪会议的代表们批准宪法十一天后，宪法文本被送往各州，*各州将召开批准会议，决定是否接受或拒绝宪法。*

This approach to ratification was an unusual one. Since the authority inherent in the Articles of Confederation and the Confederation Congress had rested on the consent of the states, changes to the nation’s government should also have been ratified by the state legislatures. Instead, by calling upon state legislatures to hold ratification conventions to approve the Constitution, the framers avoided asking the legislators to approve a document that would require them to give up a degree of their own power. The men attending the ratification conventions would be delegates elected by their neighbors to represent their interests. They were not being asked to relinquish their power; in fact, they were being asked to place limits upon the power of their state legislators, whom they may not have elected in the first place. Finally, because the new nation was to be a republic in which power was held by the people through their elected representatives, it was considered appropriate to leave the ultimate acceptance or rejection of the Constitution to the nation’s citizens. If convention delegates, who were chosen by popular vote, approved it, then the new government could rightly claim that it ruled with the consent of the people.

[.my2]
这种批准方式非同寻常。由于《邦联条例》和邦联国会的权力, 源于各州的同意，因此对国家政府的任何修改, 也理应由各州立法机构批准。然而，制宪者们并没有要求立法者批准一份需要他们放弃部分权力的文件，而是呼吁各州立法机构召开"批准大会"来批准宪法。参加批准大会的代表, 是由各州选举产生的，代表他们的利益。他们并非被要求放弃权力；事实上，他们是被要求限制本州立法者的权力，而这些立法者可能并非由他们选举产生。最后，由于新国家将是一个"由人民通过其选举产生的代表行使权力的共和国"，因此, "将最终接受或拒绝宪法的决定权,留给国民", 被认为是恰当的。如果由民众投票选出的"制宪会议代表", 批准了该法案，那么新政府就可以理直气壮地宣称，它是在人民的同意下进行统治的。



The greatest sticking point when it came to ratification, as it had been at the Constitutional Convention itself, was the relative power of the state and federal governments. The framers of the Constitution believed that without the ability to maintain and command an army and navy, impose taxes, and force the states to comply with laws passed by Congress, the young nation would not survive for very long. But many people resisted increasing the powers of the national government at the expense of the states. Virginia’s Patrick Henry, for example, feared that the newly created office of president would place excessive power in the hands of one man. He also disapproved of the federal government’s new ability to tax its citizens. This right, Henry believed, should remain with the states.

[.my2]
正如制宪会议期间一样，批准宪法的最大症结, 在于州政府和联邦政府的相对权力。宪法的制定者们认为，如果没有能力"维持和指挥陆军和海军"、"征税", 以及"强制各州遵守'国会通过的法律'"，这个年轻的国家将无法长久生存。但许多人反对以牺牲各州权力为代价, 来扩大联邦政府的权力。例如，弗吉尼亚州的帕特里克· 亨利担心，新设立的总统职位, 会将过大的权力集中在一人手中。*他还反对联邦政府被赋予"向公民征税"的新权力。亨利认为，这项权利应该保留在各州手中。*

Other delegates, such as Edmund Randolph of Virginia, disapproved of the Constitution because it created a new federal judicial system. Their fear was that the federal courts would be too far away from where those who were tried lived. State courts were located closer to the homes of both plaintiffs and defendants, and it was believed that judges and juries in state courts could better understand the actions of those who appeared before them. In response to these fears, the federal government created federal courts in each of the states as well as in Maine, which was then part of Massachusetts, and Kentucky, which was part of Virginia.

[.my2]
其他代表，例如弗吉尼亚州的埃德蒙 ·伦道夫 ，反对宪法，因为它建立了一个新的联邦司法系统。**他们担心联邦法院离"被告居住地"太远, 而州法院才是离"原告和被告的住所"更近，人们认为州法院的法官和陪审团, 能更好地理解出庭人员的行为。**为了消除这些担忧，联邦政府在每个州, 以及当时属于马萨诸塞州的缅因州, 和当时属于弗吉尼亚州的肯塔基州, 都设立了联邦法院。

Perhaps the greatest source of dissatisfaction with the Constitution was that it did not guarantee protection of individual liberties. State governments had given jury trials to residents charged with violating the law and allowed their residents to possess weapons for their protection. Some had practiced religious tolerance as well. The Constitution, however, did not contain reassurances that the federal government would do so. Although it provided for habeas corpus and prohibited both a religious test for holding office and granting noble titles, some citizens feared the loss of their traditional rights and the violation of their liberties. This led many of the Constitution’s opponents to call for a bill of rights and the refusal to ratify the document without one. The lack of a bill of rights was especially problematic in Virginia, as the Virginia Declaration of Rights was the most extensive rights-granting document among the states. The promise that a bill of rights would be drafted for the Constitution persuaded delegates in many states to support ratification.

[.my2]
或许，人们对宪法最大的不满, 在于它未能保障个人自由。各州政府曾对"被控违法的居民", 实行陪审团审判，并允许居民持有武器自卫。一些州还实行"宗教宽容"。然而，宪法并未保证联邦政府也会这样做。尽管宪法规定了"人身保护令"，并禁止以宗教信仰作为担任公职和授予贵族头衔的条件，但一些公民仍然担心失去他们的传统权利，以及他们的自由受到侵犯。这导致**许多宪法反对者, ##呼吁制定"权利法案"，##并拒绝在没有"权利法案"的情况下批准宪法。**在弗吉尼亚州，缺乏"权利法案"尤其成问题，因为《弗吉尼亚权利宣言》是各州中内容最全面的赋予权利的文件。关于将为宪法起草"权利法案"的承诺，说服了许多州的代表支持批准宪法。

Thomas Jefferson on the Bill of Rights

[.my2]
托马斯·杰斐逊论权利法案

John Adams and Thomas Jefferson carried on a lively correspondence regarding the ratification of the Constitution. In the following excerpt (reproduced as written) from a letter dated March 15, 1789, after the Constitution had been ratified by nine states but before it had been approved by all thirteen, Jefferson reiterates his previously expressed concerns that a bill of rights to protect citizens’ freedoms was necessary and should be added to the Constitution:

[.my2]
约翰· 亚当斯和托马斯· 杰斐逊, 就宪法的批准问题进行了频繁的通信。以下摘录自 1789 年 3 月 15 日的一封信（原文照录），当时宪法已获得九个州的批准，但尚未获得全部十三个州的认可。杰斐逊在信中重申了他之前表达过的担忧，即有必要制定一项"权利法案"来保护公民的自由，并将其添加到宪法中：

“In the arguments in favor of a declaration of rights, . . . I am happy to find that on the whole you are a friend to this amendment. The Declaration of rights is like all other human blessings alloyed with some inconveniences, and not accomplishing fully it’s object. But the good in this instance vastly overweighs the evil. . . . This instrument [the Constitution] forms us into one state as to certain objects, and gives us a legislative & executive body for these objects. It should therefore guard us against their abuses of power. . . . Experience proves the inefficacy of a bill of rights. True. But tho it is not absolutely efficacious under all circumstances, it is of great potency always, and rarely inefficacious. . . . There is a remarkeable difference between the . . . Inconveniences which attend a Declaration of rights, & those which attend the want of it. . . . The inconveniences of the want of a Declaration are permanent, afflicting & irreparable: they are in constant progression from bad to worse.”

[.my2]
“在支持"权利宣言"的论证中，……我很高兴地发现，总体而言，您是这项修正案的支持者。权利宣言如同所有其他人类福祉一样，也伴随着一些不便，并且未能完全实现其目标。但在这种情况下，其益处远远大于弊端……这部宪法将我们在某些目标上凝聚成一个国家，并赋予我们立法和行政机构来实现这些目标。因此，它应当保护我们免受其滥用权力……经验证明"权利法案"的无效性。诚然如此。但即便它并非在任何情况下都绝对有效，它始终具有强大的效力，而且很少失效……"权利宣言"带来的不便, 与"缺乏权利宣言"带来的不便之间, 存在着显著差异…… 缺乏权利宣言带来的不便具有永久性，令人痛苦且无法弥补：情况只会越来越糟。”

What were some of the inconveniences of not having a bill of rights that Jefferson mentioned? Why did he decide in favor of having one?

[.my2]
杰斐逊提到，没有"权利法案"会带来哪些不便？他为什么最终决定支持制定"权利法案"？

It was clear how some states would vote. Smaller states, like Delaware, favored the Constitution. Equal representation in the Senate would give them a degree of equality with the larger states, and a strong national government with an army at its command would be better able to defend them than their state militias could. Larger states, however, had significant power to lose. They did not believe they needed the federal government to defend them and disliked the prospect of having to provide tax money to support the new government. Thus, from the very beginning, the supporters of the Constitution feared that New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia would refuse to ratify it. That would mean all nine of the remaining states would have to, and Rhode Island, the smallest state, was unlikely to do so. It had not even sent delegates to the convention in Philadelphia. And even if it joined the other states in ratifying the document and the requisite nine votes were cast, the new nation would not be secure without its largest, wealthiest, and most populous states as members of the union.

[.my2]
一些州的投票意向显而易见。**像特拉华州这样的小州支持宪法。**在参议院拥有平等的代表权, 将使它们与大州享有一定程度的平等，而一个拥有军队的强大联邦政府, 也比各州的民兵更能有效地保卫它们。**然而，大州**一旦失去宪法，将面临巨大的权力损失。**它们不认为自己需要联邦政府的保护，也不愿缴纳税款来支持新政府。**因此，从一开始，宪法的支持者就担心纽约州、马萨诸塞州、宾夕法尼亚州, 和弗吉尼亚州, 会拒绝批准宪法。这意味着其余九个州都必须批准，而最小的州罗德岛不太可能这样做。它甚至没有派代表参加在费城举行的制宪会议。即使罗德岛与其他州一起批准了宪法，并且获得了所需的九票，但如果没有其最大、最富裕、人口最多的几个州加入联邦，这个新生的国家也无法安全。

=== THE RATIFICATION CAMPAIGN

[.my2]
批准运动


On the question of ratification, citizens quickly separated into two groups: Federalists and Anti-Federalists. The Federalists supported it. They tended to be among the elite members of society—wealthy and well-educated landowners, businessmen, and former military commanders who believed a strong government would be better for both national defense and economic growth. A national currency, which the federal government had the power to create, would ease business transactions. The ability of the federal government to regulate trade and place tariffs on imports would protect merchants from foreign competition. Furthermore, the power to collect taxes would allow the national government to fund internal improvements like roads, which would also help businessmen. Support for the Federalists was especially strong in New England.

[.my2]
*在批准宪法的问题上，公民很快分成了两派："联邦党人"和"反联邦党人"。 联邦党人支持宪法。他们大多是社会精英*——富有且受过良好教育的地主、商人, 以及前军事指挥官，他们认为强有力的政府有利于国防和经济增长。联邦政府有权发行国家货币，这将促进商业交易。联邦政府监管贸易, 和对进口商品征收关税的能力, 将保护商人免受外国竞争。此外，"征税权"将使联邦政府能够资助道路等内部建设，这也有利于商人。*联邦党人在"新英格兰"地区的支持尤为强烈。*

Opponents of ratification were called Anti-Federalists. Anti-Federalists feared the power of the national government and believed state legislatures, with which they had more contact, could better protect their freedoms. Although some Anti-Federalists, like Patrick Henry, were wealthy, most distrusted the elite and believed a strong federal government would favor the rich over those of “the middling sort.” This was certainly the fear of Melancton Smith, a New York merchant and landowner, who believed that power should rest in the hands of small, landowning farmers of average wealth who “are more temperate, of better morals and less ambitious than the great.” Even members of the social elite, like Henry, feared that the centralization of power would lead to the creation of a political aristocracy, to the detriment of state sovereignty and individual liberty.

[.my2]
**反对批准联邦宪法的人, 被称为"反联邦主义者" 。反联邦主义者惧怕联邦政府的权力，认为与他们联系更紧密的州议会, 更能保护他们的自由。**尽管一些反联邦主义者，例如帕特里克 ·亨利 ，家境富裕，但**大多数人并不信任精英阶层，他们认为强大的联邦政府会偏袒富人，而损害“中产阶级”的利益。**纽约商人兼地主梅兰克顿 ·史密斯也深有同样的担忧，*他认为权力应该掌握在拥有中等财富的小地主手中，因为他们“比大人物更节制、更有道德、更不野心”。*  即使是像亨利这样的社会精英, 也担心权力集中会导致"政治贵族"的出现，从而损害"州主权"和"个人自由"。

Related to these concerns were fears that the strong central government Federalists advocated for would levy taxes on farmers and planters, who lacked the hard currency needed to pay them. Many also believed Congress would impose tariffs on foreign imports that would make American agricultural products less welcome in Europe and in European colonies in the western hemisphere. For these reasons, Anti-Federalist sentiment was especially strong in the South.

[.my2]
与这些担忧相关的是，人们担心"联邦党人"所倡导的强有力的中央政府, 会向缺乏硬通货支付税款的农民和种植园主征税。**许多人还认为，国会会对外国进口商品征收关税，这将使美国农产品在欧洲和西半球的欧洲殖民地不受欢迎。由于这些原因，反联邦主义情绪在南方尤为强烈。**

Some Anti-Federalists also believed that the large federal republic that the Constitution would create could not work as intended. Americans had long believed that virtue was necessary in a nation where people governed themselves (i.e., the ability to put self-interest and petty concerns aside for the good of the larger community). In small republics, similarities among members of the community would naturally lead them to the same positions and make it easier for those in power to understand the needs of their neighbors. In a larger republic, one that encompassed nearly the entire Eastern Seaboard and ran west to the Appalachian Mountains, people would lack such a strong commonality of interests.

[.my2]
**一些反联邦主义者也认为，宪法将要建立的庞大联邦共和国, 无法按预期运作。**美国人长期以来都认为，在一个人民自治的国家里，美德是必不可少的（即为了更大社群的利益, 而将个人私利和琐碎之事搁置一边的能力）。**在小型共和国中，社群成员之间的相似性, 自然会促使他们持有相同的立场，也使得掌权者更容易理解邻里的需求。而在一个幅员辽阔的共和国中，**一个几乎囊括整个东海岸, 并向西延伸至阿巴拉契亚山脉的共和国，**人们将缺乏这种强烈的共同利益 (意思就是国家疆域太大, 各地的人民将缺乏凝聚力. 用秦晖的话说, "小共同体"更有凝聚力)。 **

Likewise, Anti-Federalists argued, the diversity of religion tolerated by the Constitution would prevent the formation of a political community with shared values and interests. The Constitution contained no provisions for government support of churches or of religious education, and Article VI explicitly forbade the use of religious tests to determine eligibility for public office. This caused many, like Henry Abbot of North Carolina, to fear that government would be placed in the hands of “pagans . . . and Mahometans [Muslims].”

[.my2]
同样，**反联邦主义者认为，宪法所容忍的宗教多样性, 会阻碍'拥有共同价值观和利益的政治共同体'的形成。**宪法没有规定政府可以资助教会或宗教教育，第六条更是明确禁止使用"宗教测试"来决定公职资格。**这使得许多人，**例如北卡罗来纳州的亨利· 阿博特 ，**担心政府会落入“异教徒……和穆斯林”手中。(这正是欧洲现在的困境, 容忍穆斯林移民的传教, 正在阻碍本土的基督教文化. 欧洲正在穆斯林化.) **

It is difficult to determine how many people were Federalists and how many were Anti-Federalists in 1787. The Federalists won the day, but they may not have been in the majority. First, the Federalist position tended to win support among businessmen, large farmers, and, in the South, plantation owners. These people tended to live along the Eastern Seaboard. In 1787, most of the states were divided into voting districts in a manner that gave more votes to the eastern part of the state than to the western part.17 Thus, in some states, like Virginia and South Carolina, small farmers who may have favored the Anti-Federalist position were unable to elect as many delegates to state ratification conventions as those who lived in the east. Small settlements may also have lacked the funds to send delegates to the convention.

[.my2]
**很难确定 1787 年联邦党人和反联邦党人的具体人数。联邦党人最终获胜，但他们可能并非多数派。**首先，联邦党的立场倾向于获得商人、大农场主, 以及南方种植园主的支持。这些人大多居住在东海岸。1787 年，大多数州的选区划分方式, 使得东部地区的选票多于西部地区。 因此 ，在一些州，例如弗吉尼亚州和南卡罗来纳州，那些可能支持反联邦党立场的小农场主, 无法像东部地区的农场主那样，选出足够多的代表参加州批准会议。 小型定居点也可能缺乏资金,派遣代表参加会议。(这里面提到的一些现象, 原因是什么, 让AI做解释)

In all the states, educated men authored pamphlets and published essays and cartoons arguing either for or against ratification (Figure 2.11). Although many writers supported each position, it is the Federalist essays that are now best known. The arguments these authors put forth, along with explicit guarantees that amendments would be added to protect individual liberties, helped to sway delegates to ratification conventions in many states.

[.my2]
*在所有州，受过教育的人士都撰写小册子、发表文章和漫画，就批准或反对《联邦法案》展开辩论*（ 图 2.11 ）。尽管许多作者支持双方的立场，但**如今最广为人知的还是《联邦党人文集》。**这些作者提出的论点，以及明确保证会通过"修正案"来保护"个人自由"的承诺，最终说服了许多州的代表, 参加批准《联邦法案》的会议。

For obvious reasons, smaller, less populous states favored the Constitution and the protection of a strong federal government. As shown in Figure 2.12, Delaware and New Jersey ratified the document within a few months after it was sent to them for approval in 1787. Connecticut ratified it early in 1788. Some of the larger states, such as Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, also voted in favor of the new government. New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify the Constitution in the summer of 1788.

[.my2]
*显而易见，人口较少的小州, 更倾向于支持宪法和强大的联邦政府。* 如图 2.12 所示，特拉华州和新泽西州在 1787 年宪法送交批准后的几个月内, 就批准了该宪法。康涅狄格州则在 1788 年初批准了宪法。一些人口较多的州，例如宾夕法尼亚州和马萨诸塞州，也投票支持新政府。新罕布什尔州于 1788 年夏季成为第九个批准宪法的州。

Figure 2.12 This timeline shows the order in which states ratified the new Constitution. Small states that would benefit from the protection of a larger union ratified the Constitution fairly quickly, such as Delaware and Connecticut. Larger, more populous states like Virginia and New York took longer. The last state to ratify was Rhode Island, a state that had always proven reluctant to act alongside the others.

[.my2]
图 2.12 这条时间线, 显示了各州批准新宪法的顺序。*一些小州，例如特拉华州和康涅狄格州，由于能从更大的联邦保护中受益，很快就批准了宪法。而像弗吉尼亚州和纽约州这样人口众多、面积较大的州则花了更长时间。最后一个批准宪法的是罗德岛州，该州一直以来都不愿与其他州保持一致。* (罗得岛州这种态度的原因是什么?)


This timeline includes twelve states with the dates that each ratified the Constitution. Delaware ratified on December 7, 1787; Pennsylvania ratified on December 12, 1787; New Jersey ratified on December 18, 1787; Georgia ratified on December 31, 1787; Connecticut ratified on January 9, 1788; Massachusetts ratified on February 6, 1788; Maryland ratified on April 26, 1788; South Carolina ratified on May 23, 1788; New Hampshire ratified on June 21, 1788; Virginia ratified on June 25, 1788; New York ratified on July 26, 1788; North Carolina ratified on November 21, 1789; and Rhode Island ratified on May 29, 1790.

[.my2]
这份时间线, 包含了12个州及其各自批准宪法的日期。特拉华州于1787年12月7日批准；宾夕法尼亚州于1787年12月12日批准；新泽西州于1787年12月18日批准；佐治亚州于1787年12月31日批准；康涅狄格州于1788年1月9日批准；马萨诸塞州于1788年2月6日批准；马里兰州于1788年4月26日批准；南卡罗来纳州于1788年5月23日批准；新罕布什尔州于1788年6月21日批准；弗吉尼亚州于1788年6月25日批准；纽约州于1788年7月26日批准；北卡罗来纳州于1789年11月21日批准；罗得岛州于1790年5月29日批准。





Although the Constitution went into effect following ratification by New Hampshire, four states still remained outside the newly formed union. Two were the wealthy, populous states of Virginia and New York. In Virginia, James Madison’s active support and the intercession of George Washington, who wrote letters to the convention, changed the minds of many. Some who had initially opposed the Constitution, such as Edmund Randolph, were persuaded that the creation of a strong union was necessary for the country’s survival and changed their position. Other Virginia delegates were swayed by the promise that a bill of rights similar to the Virginia Declaration of Rights would be added after the Constitution was ratified. On June 25, 1788, Virginia became the tenth state to grant its approval.


[.my2]
**尽管宪法**在新罕布什尔州批准后**生效，但仍有四个州不属于新成立的联邦。其中两个是富裕且人口众多的弗吉尼亚州, 和纽约州。**在弗吉尼亚州，詹姆斯·麦迪逊的积极支持, 以及乔治·华盛顿致信"制宪会议"的斡旋，改变了许多人的想法。一些最初反对宪法的人，例如埃德蒙·伦道夫，被说服，认为建立一个强大的联邦, 对于国家的生存至关重要，并改变了立场。其他弗吉尼亚州的代表则被承诺, 在宪法批准后, 会加入一份类似于《弗吉尼亚权利宣言》的"权利法案"所打动。1788年6月25日，弗吉尼亚州成为第十个批准宪法的州。

The approval of New York was the last major hurdle. Facing considerable opposition to the Constitution in that state, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay wrote a series of essays, beginning in 1787, arguing for a strong federal government and support of the Constitution (Figure 2.13). Later compiled as The Federalist and now known as The Federalist Papers, these eighty-five essays were originally published in newspapers in New York and other states under the name of Publius, a supporter of the Roman Republic.

[.my2]
**纽约州的批准是最后一个重大障碍。由于该州对宪法存在相当大的反对意见，亚历山大· 汉密尔顿 、詹姆斯 ·麦迪逊和约翰· 杰伊从 1787 年开始撰写了一系列文章，论证建立强有力的联邦政府和支持宪法的必要性（ 图 2.13 ）。这些文章后来汇编成 《联邦党人文集》，**现称为 《联邦党人文集》 。这八十五篇文章, 最初以罗马共和国支持者普布利乌斯的笔名, 发表在纽约和其他州的报纸上。

Figure 2.13 From 1787 to 1788, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay authored a series of essays intended to convince Americans, especially New Yorkers, to support the new Constitution. These essays, which originally appeared in newspapers, were collected and published together under the title The Federalist in 1788. They are now known as The Federalist Papers.


图 2.13 1787 年至 1788 年间，亚历山大·汉密尔顿、詹姆斯·麦迪逊和约翰·杰伊撰写了一系列文章，旨在说服美国人，尤其是纽约人，支持新宪法。这些文章最初发表在报纸上，后于 1788 年汇编成册，题为 《联邦党人文集》（The Federalist ）。如今，它们被称为 《联邦党人文集》（The Federalist Papers ）。


The essays addressed a variety of issues that troubled citizens. For example, in Federalist No. 51, attributed to James Madison (Figure 2.14), the author assured readers they did not need to fear that the national government would grow too powerful. The federal system, in which power was divided between the national and state governments, and the division of authority within the federal government into separate branches would prevent any one part of the government from becoming too strong. Furthermore, tyranny could not arise in a government in which “the legislature necessarily predominates.” Finally, the desire of office holders in each branch of government to exercise the powers given to them, described as “personal motives,” would encourage them to limit any attempt by the other branches to overstep their authority. According to Madison, “Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.”

[.my2]
**这些文章探讨了困扰民众的各种问题。**例如，在归于詹姆斯·麦迪逊名下的 《联邦党人文集 》第 51 篇（ 图 2.14 ）中，作者向读者保证，他们不必担心联邦政府权力过大。联邦制将权力在"联邦政府"和"州政府"之间划分，联邦政府内部的权力, 也分为不同的部门，这将防止政府的任何一个部门权力过大。此外，**在一个“立法机关必然占据主导地位”的政府中，暴政也不可能出现。**最后，#*政府各部门官员行使权力的愿望（被描述为“个人动机”）将促使他们限制其他部门越权的行为。正如麦迪逊所说，“野心 必须以野心来制衡”。*#

Other essays countered different criticisms made of the Constitution and echoed the argument in favor of a strong national government. In Federalist No. 35, for example, Hamilton (Figure 2.14) argued that people’s interests could in fact be represented by men who were not their neighbors. Indeed, Hamilton asked rhetorically, would American citizens best be served by a representative “whose observation does not travel beyond the circle of his neighbors and his acquaintances” or by someone with more extensive knowledge of the world? To those who argued that a merchant and land-owning elite would come to dominate Congress, Hamilton countered that the majority of men currently sitting in New York’s state senate and assembly were landowners of moderate wealth and that artisans usually chose merchants, “their natural patron[s] and friend[s],” to represent them. An aristocracy would not arise, and if it did, its members would have been chosen by lesser men. Similarly, Jay reminded New Yorkers in Federalist No. 2 that union had been the goal of Americans since the time of the Revolution. A desire for union was natural among people of such “similar sentiments” who “were united to each other by the strongest ties,” and the government proposed by the Constitution was the best means of achieving that union.

[.my2]
其他文章则反驳了对宪法的各种批评，并呼应了支持建立强有力的中央政府的论点。例如，在 《联邦党人文集 》第 35 篇中，汉密尔顿（ 图 2.14 ）论证说，人民的利益实际上可以由"并非其邻居的人"来代表。事实上，汉密尔顿反问道，美国公民究竟是由一位“视野仅限于邻居和熟人圈子”的代表, 来更好地服务，还是由一位拥有更广阔世界视野的人, 来更好地服务？**对于那些认为"商人和地主精英将主导国会"的观点， 汉密尔顿反驳说，目前纽约州参议院和众议院的大多数议员, 都是中等财富的地主，而且工匠通常会选择商人——“他们天然的赞助人和朋友”——来代表他们。**贵族阶层不会出现，即使出现，其成员也应该是由地位较低的人选出的。同样， 杰伊在 《联邦党人文集 》第二篇中提醒纽约人，自美国独立战争以来，"统一"一直是美国人的目标。对于那些拥有“相似情谊”且“彼此之间有着最牢固纽带”的人们来说，渴望统一是自然而然的，而宪法所提议的政府, 正是实现这种统一的最佳途径。

Despite the fact that he did not believe that a Bill of Rights was necessary, he wrote one in order to allay the fears of those who believed the federal government was too powerful. He also served as Thomas Jefferson’s Secretary of State and was elected president himself in 1808. Alexander Hamilton (b) was one of the greatest political minds of the early United States. He authored the majority of The Federalist Papers and served as Secretary of the Treasury in George Washington’s administration.

詹姆斯·麦迪逊（a）在宪法的制定过程中发挥了至关重要的作用。他是"制宪会议"的重要参与者，并撰写了多篇 《联邦党人文集》 。尽管他并不认为有必要制定"权利法案"，但他还是撰写了该法案，以消除那些认为联邦政府权力过大的人们的担忧。他还曾担任托马斯·杰斐逊的国务卿，并于 1808 年当选总统。**亚历山大·汉密尔顿（b）是美国早期最伟大的政治家之一。他撰写了大部分 《联邦党人文集》 ，**并在乔治·华盛顿政府中担任财政部长。


Objections that an elite group of wealthy and educated bankers, businessmen, and large landowners would come to dominate the nation’s politics were also addressed by Madison in Federalist No. 10. Americans need not fear the power of factions or special interests, he argued, for the republic was too big and the interests of its people too diverse to allow the development of large, powerful political parties. Likewise, elected representatives, who were expected to “possess the most attractive merit,” would protect the government from being controlled by “an unjust and interested [biased in favor of their own interests] majority.”

针对"富裕且受过良好教育的银行家、商人和大地主精英阶层, 将主导国家政治"的担忧，**麦迪逊**在 《联邦党人文集》 第十篇中也予以了回应。**他认为，美国人不必惧怕派系或特殊利益集团的势力，因为共和国幅员辽阔，人民利益多元，难以形成强大的政党。**同样，民选代表应“具备最优秀的品质”，才能保护政府免受“不公正,且偏袒自身利益的多数派”的控制。

For those who worried that the president might indeed grow too ambitious or king-like, Hamilton, in Federalist No. 68, provided assurance that placing the leadership of the country in the hands of one person was not dangerous. Electors from each state would select the president. Because these men would be members of a “transient” body called together only for the purpose of choosing the president and would meet in separate deliberations in each state, they would be free of corruption and beyond the influence of the “heats and ferments” of the voters. Indeed, Hamilton argued in Federalist No. 70, instead of being afraid that the president would become a tyrant, Americans should realize that it was easier to control one person than it was to control many. Furthermore, one person could also act with an “energy” that Congress did not possess. Making decisions alone, the president could decide what actions should be taken faster than could Congress, whose deliberations, because of its size, were necessarily slow. At times, the “decision, activity, secrecy, and dispatch” of the chief executive might be necessary.

对于那些担心"总统可能会变得过于野心勃勃或专横跋扈"的人，汉密尔顿在 《联邦党人文集》 第 68 篇中保证，将国家领导权交给一个人并不危险。各州的选举人, 将选出总统。由于这些选举人, 只是一个为选举总统而临时召集的机构，并且会在每个州分别举行会议，因此他们将不受腐败的影响，也不会受到选民“情绪和冲动”的影响。事实上，汉密尔顿在 《联邦党人文集 》第 70 篇中论证说，**美国人不应该担心总统会变成暴君，而应该意识到, 控制一个人, 比控制很多人要容易得多。**此外，一个人还可以拥有国会所不具备的“活力”。**总统可以独自做出决定，比国会能更快地决定应该采取哪些行动，因为国会由于规模庞大，审议过程必然缓慢。**有时，行政首脑的“决策、行动、保密性和效率”是必要的。

The Library of Congress has The Federalist Papers on their website. The Anti-Federalists also produced a body of writings, less extensive than The Federalists Papers, which argued against the ratification of the Constitution. However, these were not written by one small group of men as The Federalist Papers had been. A collection of the writings that are unofficially called The Anti-Federalist Papers is also available online.

美国国会图书馆的网站上有 《联邦党人文集》 。反联邦党人也撰写了一系列文章， 篇幅不如《联邦党人文集》 长，但同样反对批准宪法。然而，这些文章并非像 《联邦党人文集》 那样出自一小群人之手。一部非正式地被称为 《反联邦党人文集》 的文章合集, 也可在网上找到。

The arguments of the Federalists were persuasive, but whether they actually succeeded in changing the minds of New Yorkers is unclear. Once Virginia ratified the Constitution on June 25, 1788, New York realized that it had little choice but to do so as well. If it did not ratify the Constitution, it would be the last large state that had not joined the union. Thus, on July 26, 1788, the majority of delegates to New York’s ratification convention voted to accept the Constitution. A year later, North Carolina became the twelfth state to approve. Alone and realizing it could not hope to survive on its own, Rhode Island became the last state to ratify, nearly two years after New York had done so.

**联邦党人的论点颇具说服力，但他们是否真的成功改变了纽约人的想法, 尚不清楚。**1788年6月25日，弗吉尼亚州批准了宪法后，纽约州意识到自己别无选择，也只能批准。如果不批准宪法，它将成为最后一个尚未加入联邦的大州。因此，1788年7月26日，参加"纽约批准大会"的大多数代表, 投票接受了宪法。一年后，北卡罗来纳州成为第十二个批准宪法的州。罗德岛州孤立无援，意识到自己无法独自生存，最终在纽约州批准宪法近两年后，成为最后一个批准宪法的州。

Term Limits

[.my2]
任期限制

One of the objections raised to the Constitution’s new government was that it did not set term limits for members of Congress or the president. Those who opposed a strong central government argued that this failure could allow a handful of powerful men to gain control of the nation and rule it for as long as they wished. Although the framers did not anticipate the idea of career politicians, those who supported the Constitution argued that reelecting the president and reappointing senators by state legislatures would create a body of experienced men who could better guide the country through crises. A president who did not prove to be a good leader would be voted out of office instead of being reelected. In fact, presidents long followed George Washington’s example and limited themselves to two terms. Only in 1951, after Franklin Roosevelt had been elected four times, was the Twenty-Second Amendment passed to restrict the presidency to two terms.

**针对新宪法所建立的政府，有人提出异议，认为它没有对国会议员和总统的任期, 做出限制。**反对中央集权的人认为，这一缺陷可能使少数权势人物掌控国家，并随心所欲地统治下去。尽管宪法的制定者并未预料到"职业政客"的出现，但支持宪法的人认为，总统连任和参议员由各州议会重新任命，能够培养出一批经验丰富的领导人，更好地带领国家渡过危机。如果总统未能证明自己是一位优秀的领导人，他将被选民罢免，而不是连任。**事实上，总统们长期以来都效仿乔治·华盛顿的做法，将任期限制在两届以内。直到 1951 年，在富兰克林 ·罗斯福连任四届之后，才通过了第二十二修正案，将总统任期限制在两届以内。**

Are term limits a good idea? Should they have originally been included in the Constitution? Why or why not? Are there times when term limits might not be good?

任期限制是好主意吗？宪法最初是否应该包含"任期限制"？为什么？是否存在不宜实行"任期限制"的情况？
