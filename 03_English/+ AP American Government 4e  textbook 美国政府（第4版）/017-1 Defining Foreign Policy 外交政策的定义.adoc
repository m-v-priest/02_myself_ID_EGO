== 释义




When we consider policy as our chapter focus, we are looking broadly at the actions the U.S. government carries out for particular purposes. In the case of foreign policy, that purpose is to manage its relationships with other nations of the world. Another distinction is that policy results from a course of action or a pattern of actions over time, rather than from a single action or decision. For example, U.S. foreign policy with Russia has been forged by several presidents, as well as by cabinet secretaries, House and Senate members, and foreign policy agency bureaucrats. Policy is also purposive, or intended to do something; that is, policymaking is not random. When the United States enters into an international agreement with other countries on aims such as free trade or nuclear disarmament, it does so for specific reasons. With that general definition of policy established, we shall now dig deeper into the specific domain of U.S. foreign policy.

[.my2]
当我们把政策作为本章的重点时，我们指的是美国政府为实现特定目标而采取的行动。就外交政策而言，其目的在于管理与世界其他国家的关系。另一个区别在于，政策并非源于单一的行动或决定，而是源于一系列行动或行动模式的长期积累。例如， 美国对俄外交政策是由多位总统、内阁部长、参众两院议员以及外交政策机构官员共同制定的。政策也具有目的性，即旨在实现某种目标；也就是说，政策制定并非随意而为。当美国与其他国家就自由贸易或核裁军等目标达成国际协议时，其背后都有着具体的原因。在明确了政策的总体定义之后，我们将深入探讨美国外交政策的具体领域。

FOREIGN POLICY BASICS  外交政策基础知识
What is foreign policy? We can think of it on several levels, as “the goals that a state’s officials seek to attain abroad, the values that give rise to those objectives, and the means or instruments used to pursue them.”1 This definition highlights some of the key topics in U.S. foreign policy, such as national goals abroad and the manner in which the United States tries to achieve them. Note too that we distinguish foreign policy, which is externally focused, from domestic policy, which sets strategies internal to the United States, though the two types of policies can become quite intertwined. So, for example, one might talk about Latino politics as a domestic issue when considering educational policies designed to increase the number of Hispanic Americans who attend and graduate from a U.S. college or university.2 However, as demonstrated in the primary debates leading up to the 2016 election, Latino politics can quickly become a foreign policy matter when considering topics such as immigration from and foreign trade with countries in Central America and South America (Figure 17.2).3
什么是外交政策 ？我们可以从多个层面来理解它，例如“一个国家官员在海外寻求实现的目标、促成这些目标的价值观，以及实现这些目标所使用的手段或工具” 。¹ 这个定义突出了美国外交政策的一些关键议题，例如国家在海外的目标以及美国实现这些目标的方式。还要注意的是，我们将外交政策（侧重于外部事务）与国内政策（制定美国内部战略）区分开来，尽管这两种政策有时会交织在一起。例如，在讨论旨在增加美国高校就读和毕业的拉美裔美国人数量的教育政策时，人们可能会将拉美裔政治视为一个国内议题 。² 然而，正如 2016 年大选前的初选辩论所表明的那样，当讨论来自中美洲和南美洲国家的移民以及与这些国家的对外贸易等议题时，拉美裔政治很快就会演变为一个外交政策问题（ 图 17.2 ） 。³

图 17.2 国内问题有时会演变为国际问题，例如对外贸易问题。图中，2005 年 8 月 2 日，美国总统乔治·W· 布什在签署《 中美洲自由贸易协定（CAFTA）实施法案》 后，与立法者和政府官员握手。
What are the objectives of U.S. foreign policy? While the goals of a nation’s foreign policy are always open to debate and revision, there are nonetheless four main goals to which we can attribute much of what the U.S. government does in the foreign policy realm: (1) the protection of the U.S. and its citizens, (2) the maintenance of access to key resources and markets, (3) the preservation of a balance of power in the world, and (4) the protection of human rights and democracy.

[.my2]
美国外交政策的目标是什么？虽然一个国家的外交政策目标总是可以讨论和修改的，但我们仍然可以归因于美国政府在外交政策领域的大部分行动的四个主要目标：（1）保护美国及其公民；（2）维持获得关键资源和市场的途径；（3）维护世界权力平衡；（4）保护人权和民主。

The first goal is the protection of the United States and the lives of it citizens, both while they are in the United States and when they travel abroad. Related to this security goal is the aim of protecting the country’s allies, or countries with which the United States is friendly and mutually supportive. In the international sphere, threats and dangers can take several forms, including military threats from other nations or terrorist groups and economic threats from boycotts and high tariffs on trade. An economic sanction occurs when a country or multiple countries suspend trade or other financial relationships with another country in order to signal their displeasure with the behavior of the other country.

[.my2]
首要目标是保护美国及其公民的生命安全，无论他们身处美国境内还是出国旅行。与此安全目标密切相关的是保护美国的盟友，即与美国友好且相互支持的国家。在国际领域，威胁和危险可能以多种形式出现，包括来自其他国家或恐怖组织的军事威胁，以及来自抵制和高额关税的经济威胁。 经济制裁是指一个或多个国家暂停与另一个国家的贸易或其他金融关系，以表达对该国行为的不满。

In an economic boycott, the United States ceases trade with another country unless or until it changes a policy to which the United States objects. Ceasing trade means U.S. goods cannot be sold in that country and its goods cannot be sold in the United States. For example, in recent years the United States and other countries implemented an economic boycott of Iran as it escalated the development of its nuclear energy program. The recent Iran nuclear deal is a pact in which Iran agrees to halt nuclear development while the United States and six other countries lift economic sanctions to again allow trade with Iran. Barriers to trade also include tariffs, or fees charged for moving goods from one country to another. Protectionist trade policies raise tariffs so that it becomes difficult for imported goods, now more expensive, to compete on price with domestic goods. Free trade agreements seek to reduce these trade barriers.

[.my2]
在经济抵制中，美国会停止与他国的贸易，除非他国改变美国反对的政策。停止贸易意味着美国商品不能在该国销售，该国商品也不能在美国销售。例如，近年来，由于伊朗加速发展其核能计划，美国和其他国家对伊朗实施了经济抵制。最近达成的伊朗核协议是一项协议，根据该协议，伊朗同意停止核能发展，而美国和其他六个国家则解除经济制裁，恢复与伊朗的贸易。贸易壁垒还包括关税，即货物从一个国家运往另一个国家所收取的费用。贸易保护主义政策会提高关税，使进口商品（价格上涨）难以与国内商品在价格上竞争。自由贸易协定旨在减少这些贸易壁垒。

The second main goal of U.S. foreign policy is to ensure the nation maintains access to key resources and markets across the world. Resources include natural resources, such as oil, and economic resources, including the infusion of foreign capital investment for U.S. domestic infrastructure projects like buildings, bridges, and weapons systems. Of course, access to the international marketplace also means access to goods that American consumers might want, such as Swiss chocolate and Australian wine. U.S. foreign policy also seeks to advance the interests of U.S. business, to both sell domestic products in the international marketplace and support general economic development around the globe (especially in developing countries).

[.my2]
美国外交政策的第二个主要目标是确保美国能够持续获得全球关键资源和市场。这些资源包括石油等自然资源，以及经济资源，例如吸引外国资本投资用于美国国内基础设施项目，如建筑物、桥梁和武器系统。当然，进入国际市场也意味着能够获得美国消费者可能需要的商品，例如瑞士巧克力和澳大利亚葡萄酒。美国外交政策还致力于促进美国企业的利益，既要将美国产品推向国际市场，又要支持全球（尤其是发展中国家）的整体经济发展。

A third main goal is the preservation of a balance of power in the world. A balance of power means no one nation or region is much more powerful militarily than are the countries of the rest of the world. The achievement of a perfect balance of power is probably not possible, but general stability, or predictability in the operation of governments, strong institutions, and the absence of violence within and between nations may be. For much of U.S. history, leaders viewed world stability through the lens of Europe. If the European continent was stable, so too was the world. During the Cold War era that followed World War II, stability was achieved by the existence of dual superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, and by the real fear of the nuclear annihilation of which both were capable. Until approximately 1989–1990, advanced industrial democracies aligned themselves behind one of these two superpowers.

[.my2]
第三个主要目标是维护世界权力平衡。 权力平衡意味着没有任何一个国家或地区的军事实力远超世界其他国家。实现完美的权力平衡或许不可能，但政府运作的总体稳定或可预测性、强大的机构以及国家内部和国家之间避免暴力冲突是可以实现的。在美国历史的大部分时期，领导人都是以欧洲的视角来看待世界稳定。如果欧洲大陆稳定，世界也就稳定。在二战后的冷战时期，稳定是通过美苏两大超级大国的存在以及对两国核毁灭能力的真正恐惧来实现的。直到大约 1989-1990 年，发达工业民主国家都倾向于支持这两个超级大国中的一个。

Today, in the post–Cold War era, many parts of Europe are politically more free than they were during the years of the Soviet bloc, and there is less fear of nuclear war than when the United States and the Soviet Union had missiles pointed at each other for four straight decades. However, despite the mostly stabilizing presence of the European Union (EU), which now has twenty-eight member countries, several wars have been fought in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Moreover, the EU itself faces some challenges, including a vote in the United Kingdom to leave the EU, the ongoing controversy about how to resolve the national debt of Greece, and the crisis in Europe created by thousands of refugees from the Middle East.

[.my2]
如今，在后冷战时代，欧洲许多地区的政治自由度远胜于苏联集团时期，核战争的威胁也远不及美苏导弹对峙长达四十年的时期。然而，尽管拥有二十八个成员国的欧盟在很大程度上发挥了稳定作用，东欧和前苏联地区仍然爆发了数场战争。此外，欧盟自身也面临着一些挑战，例如英国脱欧公投、希腊国家债务问题悬而未决，以及成千上万来自中东的难民涌入欧洲引发的危机。

Carefully planned acts of terrorism in the United States, Asia, and Europe have introduced a new type of enemy into the balance of power equation—nonstate or nongovernmental organizations, such as al-Qaeda and ISIS (or ISIL), consisting of various terrorist cells located in many different countries and across all continents (Figure 17.3).

[.my2]
美国、亚洲和欧洲精心策划的恐怖主义行为，在力量平衡方程式中引入了一种新型敌人——非国家或非政府组织，如基地组织和伊斯兰国（或伊拉克和黎凡特伊斯兰国），由分布在许多不同国家和各大洲的各种恐怖分子小组组成​​（ 图 17.3 ）。

The fourth main goal of U.S. foreign policy is the protection of human rights and democracy. The payoff of stability that comes from other U.S. foreign policy goals is peace and tranquility. While certainly looking out for its own strategic interests in considering foreign policy strategy, the United States nonetheless attempts to support international peace through many aspects of its foreign policy, such as foreign aid, and through its support of and participation in international organizations such as the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the Organization of American States.

[.my2]
美国外交政策的第四个主要目标是保护人权和民主。其他外交政策目标带来的稳定回报是和平与安宁。尽管美国在制定外交政策战略时当然会考虑自身的战略利益，但它仍然致力于通过外交政策的诸多方面来维护国际和平，例如对外援助，以及通过支持和参与联合国、 北大西洋公约组织 （北约）和美洲国家组织等国际组织。

The United Nations (UN) is perhaps the foremost international organization in the world today. The main institutional bodies of the UN are the General Assembly and the Security Council. The General Assembly includes all member nations and admits new members and approves the UN budget by a two-thirds majority. The Security Council includes fifteen countries, five of which are permanent members (including the United States) and ten that are non-permanent and rotate on a five two-year-term basis. The entire membership is bound by decisions of the Security Council, which makes all decisions related to international peace and security. Two other important units of the UN are the International Court of Justice in The Hague (Netherlands) and the UN Secretariat, which includes the Secretary-General of the UN and the UN staff directors and employees.

[.my2]
联合国或许是当今世界最重要的国际组织。联合国的主要机构是大会和安全理事会。大会由所有成员国组成，负责接纳新成员并以三分之二多数票批准联合国预算。安全理事会由十五个国家组成，其中五个是常任理事国（包括美国），十个是非常任理事国，任期五年，每届两年。所有成员国均受安全理事会决议的约束，安全理事会负责制定所有与国际和平与安全相关的决定。联合国另外两个重要机构是位于荷兰海牙的国际法院和联合国秘书处，秘书处包括联合国秘书长以及联合国各部门主管和雇员。

Milestone  里程碑
The Creation of the United Nations
联合国的创立
One of the unique and challenging aspects of global affairs is the fact that no world-level authority exists to mandate when and how the world’s nations interact. After the failed attempt by President Woodrow Wilson and others to formalize a “League of Nations” in the wake of World War I in the 1920s, and on the heels of a worldwide depression that began in 1929, came World War II, history’s deadliest military conflict. Now, in the early decades of the twenty-first century, it is common to think of the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 as the big game-changer. Yet while 9/11 was hugely significant in the United States and abroad, World War II was even more so. The December 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (Hawaii) was a comparable surprise-style attack that plunged the United States into war.

[.my2]
全球事务独特而又充满挑战的方面之一在于，目前尚无任何世界级权威机构来规定各国何时以及如何互动。第一次世界大战结束后，伍德罗· 威尔逊总统等人于 20 世纪 20 年代尝试建立“ 国际联盟 ”，但最终失败。紧随 1929 年开始的全球经济大萧条之后，第二次世界大战爆发，成为历史上伤亡最惨重的军事冲突。如今，在 21 世纪初的几十年里，人们普遍认为 2001 年的 9·11 恐怖袭击是改变格局的重大事件。然而，尽管 9·11 事件在美国乃至世界范围内都具有巨大的意义，但第二次世界大战的影响更为深远。1941 年 12 月，日本偷袭珍珠港（夏威夷），同样是一次突袭，将美国拖入了战争。

The scope of the conflict, fought in Europe and the Pacific Ocean, and Hitler’s nearly successful attempt to take over Europe entirely, struck fear in minds and hearts. The war brought about a sea change in international relations and governance, from the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe, to NATO that created a cross-national military shield for Western Europe, to the creation of the UN in 1945, when the representatives of fifty countries met and signed the Charter of the United Nations in San Francisco, California (Figure 17.4).

[.my2]
这场冲突的规模之大，横跨欧洲和太平洋，以及希特勒几乎成功地完全占领欧洲的企图，令世人胆战心惊。战争给国际关系和治理带来了翻天覆地的变化，从重建欧洲的马歇尔计划，到为西欧建立跨国军事屏障的北约，再到 1945 年联合国的成立——当时五十个国家的代表齐聚加利福尼亚州旧金山，签署了《联合国宪章》（ 图 17.4 ）。

Today, the United Nations, headquartered in New York City, includes 193 of the 195 nations of the world. It is a voluntary association to which member nations pay dues based on the size of their economy. The UN’s main purposes are to maintain peace and security, promote human rights and social progress, and develop friendly relationships among nations.

[.my2]
联合国总部位于纽约，目前由世界上195个国家中的193个组成。它是一个自愿加入的组织，成员国根据其经济规模缴纳会费。联合国的主要宗旨是维护世界和平与安全，促进人权和社会进步，并发展各国之间的友好关系。

Follow-up activity: In addition to facilitating collective decision-making on world matters, the UN carries out many different programs. Go to the UN website to find information about three different UN programs that are carried out around the world.

后续活动：除了促进就世界事务进行集体决策外，联合国还开展了许多不同的项目。请访问联合国网站 ，了解联合国在全球开展的三项不同项目的信息。

An ongoing question for the United States in waging the war against terrorism is to what degree it should work in concert with the UN to carry out anti-terrorism initiatives around the world in a multilateral manner, rather than pursuing a “go it alone” strategy of unilateralism. The fact that the U.S. government has such a choice suggests the voluntary nature of the United States (or another country) accepting world-level governance in foreign policy. If the United States truly felt bound by UN opinion regarding the manner in which it carries out its war on terrorism, it would approach the UN Security Council for approval.

[.my2]
美国在反恐战争中面临的一个持续性问题是：它应该在多大程度上与联合国合作，以多边方式在全球范围内开展反恐行动，而不是奉行单边主义的“单打独斗”战略。美国政府拥有这样的选择权，表明美国（或其他国家）在外交政策中接受世界层面的治理是自愿的。如果美国真的认为其反恐战争的方式必须遵循联合国的意见，它就会向联合国安理会寻求批准。

Another cross-national organization to which the United States is tied, and that exists to forcefully represent Western allies and in turn forge the peace, is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). NATO was formed after World War II as the Cold War between East and West started to emerge. While more militaristic in approach than the United Nations, NATO has the goal of protecting the interests of Europe and the West and the assurance of support and defense from partner nations. However, while it is a strong military coalition, it has not sought to expand and take over other countries. Rather, the peace and stability of Europe are its main goals. NATO initially included only Western European nations and the United States. However, since the end of the Cold War, additional countries from the East, such as Turkey, have entered into the NATO alliance.

[.my2]
美国参与的另一个跨国组织是北大西洋公约组织（北约） ，该组织旨在强力代表西方盟国，进而维护和平。北约成立于二战后，当时东西方冷战开始抬头。虽然北约的行事方式比联合国更具军事色彩，但其目标是保护欧洲和西方的利益，并确保伙伴国的支持和防御。然而，尽管北约是一个强大的军事联盟，但它并未寻求扩张或吞并其他国家。相反，维护欧洲的和平与稳定才是其主要目标。北约最初仅包括西欧国家和美国。然而，自冷战结束以来，来自东方的更多国家，例如土耳其，也加入了北约联盟。

Besides participating in the UN and NATO, the United States also distributes hundreds of millions of dollars each year in foreign aid to improve the quality of life of citizens in developing countries. The United States may also forgive the foreign debts of these countries. By definition, developing countries are not modernized in terms of infrastructure and social services and thus suffer from instability. Helping them modernize and develop stable governments is intended as a benefit to them and a prop to the stability of the world. An alternative view of U.S. assistance is that there are more nefarious goals at work, that perhaps it is intended to buy influence in developing countries, secure a position in the region, obtain access to resources, or foster dependence on the United States.

[.my2]
除了参与联合国和北约之外，美国每年还向发展中国家提供数亿美元的援助，以改善这些国家人民的生活质量。美国甚至可能免除这些国家的外债。顾名思义，发展中国家的基础设施和社会服务尚未现代化，因此容易出现不稳定。帮助它们实现现代化并建立稳定的政府，既有利于它们自身，也有利于世界稳定。然而，另一种观点认为，美国的援助背后可能隐藏着更为险恶的目的，例如，美国或许意在收买发展中国家的影响力，巩固其在该地区的地位，获取资源，或者促使这些国家依赖美国。

The United States pursues its four main foreign policy goals through several different foreign policy types, or distinct substantive areas of foreign policy in which the United States is engaged. These types are trade, diplomacy, sanctions, military/defense, intelligence, foreign aid, and global environmental policy.

[.my2]
美国通过几种不同的外交政策类型，或者说美国参与的几个不同的实质性外交政策领域，来实现其四大主要外交政策目标。这些类型包括贸易、外交、制裁、军事/国防、情报、对外援助和全球环境政策。

Trade policy is the way the United States interacts with other countries to ease the flow of commerce and goods and services between countries. A country is said to be engaging in protectionism when it does not permit other countries to sell goods and services within its borders, or when it charges them very high tariffs (or import taxes) to do so. At the other end of the spectrum is a free trade approach, in which a country allows the unfettered flow of goods and services between itself and other countries. At times the United States has been free trade–oriented, while at other times it has been protectionist. Perhaps its most free trade–oriented move was the 1991 implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This pact removed trade barriers and other transaction costs levied on goods moving between the United States, Mexico, and Canada.

[.my2]
贸易政策是指美国与其他国家互动，以促进各国之间商业、商品和服务流通的方式。当一个国家不允许其他国家在其境内销售商品和服务，或对其征收极高的关税（或进口税）时，就被认为是在实行贸易保护主义 。与之相反的是自由贸易政策，即允许商品和服务在其与其他国家之间自由流动。美国有时奉行自由贸易政策，有时则采取贸易保护主义。或许其最倾向于自由贸易的举措是 1991 年实施的《 北美自由贸易协定》 （NAFTA）。该协定取消了美国、墨西哥和加拿大之间商品流通的贸易壁垒和其他交易成本。

Critics see a free trade approach as problematic and instead advocate for protectionist policies that shield U.S. companies and their products against cheaper foreign products that might be imported here. One of the more prominent recent examples of protectionist policies occurred in the steel industry, as U.S. companies in the international steel marketplace struggled with competition from Chinese factories in particular.

[.my2]
批评人士认为自由贸易模式存在问题，转而提倡保护主义政策，以保护美国公司及其产品免受可能进口的更廉价外国产品的冲击。近期一个较为突出的保护主义政策案例发生在钢铁行业，当时美国公司在国际钢铁市场上尤其面临着来自中国工厂的激烈竞争。

The balance of trade is the relationship between a country’s inflow and outflow of goods. The United States sells many goods and services around the world, but overall it maintains a trade deficit, in which more goods and services are coming in from other countries than are going out to be sold overseas. The March, 2025 U.S. trade deficit was $140.5 billion, which means the value of what the United States imports from other countries is much larger than the value of what it exports to other countries.4 This trade deficit has led some to advocate for protectionist trade policies.

[.my2]
贸易平衡是指一个国家商品流入量与流出量之间的关系。美国向世界各地销售多种商品和服务，但总体而言，它存在贸易逆差，即从其他国家进口的商品和服务多于出口到海外的商品和服务。2025 年 3 月，美国的贸易逆差为 1405 亿美元，这意味着美国从其他国家进口的商品和服务价值远大于其出口到其他国家的商品和服务价值。⁴ 这种贸易逆差导致一些人主张采取贸易保护主义政策。

For many, foreign policy is synonymous with diplomacy. Diplomacy is the establishment and maintenance of a formal relationship between countries that governs their interactions on matters as diverse as tourism, the taxation of goods they trade, and the landing of planes on each other’s runways. While diplomatic relations are not always rosy, when they are operating it does suggest that things are going well between the countries. Diplomatic relations are formalized through the sharing of ambassadors. Ambassadors are country representatives who live and maintain an office (known as an embassy) in the other country. Just as exchanging ambassadors formalizes the bilateral relationship between countries, calling them home signifies the end of the relationship. Diplomacy tends to be the U.S. government’s first step when it tries to resolve a conflict with another country.

[.my2]
对许多人来说，外交政策等同于外交。 外交是指国家间建立和维护正式关系，这种关系规范着两国在旅游、贸易商品税收以及飞机在对方跑道上起降等诸多领域的互动。虽然外交关系并非总是一帆风顺，但当外交关系正常运作时，则表明两国关系进展顺利。外交关系的正式化是通过互派大使实现的。大使是国家的代表，他们居住在对方国家并设立办公室（即大使馆）。正如互派大使使两国间的双边关系正式化一样，召回大使也标志着这种关系的结束。当美国政府试图解决与他国的冲突时，外交往往是其首选手段。

To illustrate how international relations play out when countries come into conflict, consider what has become known as the Hainan Island incident. In 2001, a U.S. spy plane collided with a Chinese jet fighter near Chinese airspace, where U.S. planes were not authorized to be. The Chinese jet fighter crashed and the pilot died. The U.S. plane made an emergency landing on the island of Hainan. China retrieved the aircraft and captured the U.S. pilots. U.S. ambassadors then attempted to negotiate for their return. These negotiations were slow and ended up involving officials of the president’s cabinet, but they ultimately worked. Had they not succeeded, an escalating set of options likely would have included diplomatic sanctions (removal of ambassadors), economic sanctions (such as an embargo on trade and the flow of money between the countries), minor military options (such as establishment of a no-fly zone just outside Chinese airspace), or more significant military options (such as a focused campaign to enter China and get the pilots back). Nonmilitary tools to influence another country, like economic sanctions, are referred to as soft power, while the use of military power is termed hard power.5
为了说明国家间冲突时国际关系的走向，不妨看看后来被称为“海南岛事件”的案例。2001 年，一架美国侦察机在中国领空附近与一架中国战斗机相撞，而美国飞机并未被授权进入该区域。中国战斗机坠毁，飞行员遇难。美国飞机在海南岛紧急迫降。中国方面取回了飞机并扣押了美国飞行员。随后，美国大使试图与中国谈判，以换取飞行员的释放。谈判进展缓慢，最终甚至牵涉到总统内阁官员，但最终取得了成功。如果谈判失败，一系列升级的选项可能包括外交制裁（例如撤换大使）、经济制裁（例如禁止两国之间的贸易和资金流动）、小规模军事行动（例如在中国领空附近设立禁飞区），或者更大规模的军事行动（例如发起一次有针对性的军事行动，进入中国境内营救飞行员）。运用非军事手段影响他国，例如经济制裁，被称为软实力 ；而运用军事力量则被称为硬实力 。5

At the more serious end of the foreign policy decision-making spectrum, and usually as a last resort when diplomacy fails, the U.S. military and defense establishment exists to provide the United States the ability to wage war against other state and nonstate actors. Such war can be offensive, as were the Iraq War in 2003 and the 1989 removal of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega. Or it can be defensive, as a means to respond to aggression from others, such as the Persian Gulf War in 1991, also known as Operation Desert Storm (Figure 17.5). The potential for military engagement, and indeed the scattering about the globe of hundreds of U.S. military installations, can also be a potential source of foreign policy strength for the United States. On the other hand, in the world of diplomacy, such an approach can be seen as imperialistic by other world nations.

[.my2]
在外交政策决策中更为严肃的一端，通常是外交手段失效后的最后手段，美国军方和国防机构的存在是为了赋予美国对其他国家和非国家行为体发动战争的能力。这种战争可以是进攻性的，例如 2003 年的伊拉克战争和 1989 年推翻巴拿马领导人曼努埃尔· 诺列加的行动。也可以是防御性的，作为应对他国侵略的手段，例如 1991 年的海湾战争 ，也称为“沙漠风暴行动”（ 图 17.5 ）。军事行动的可能性，以及遍布全球的数百个美国军事设施，本身也可以成为美国外交政策实力的潜在来源。另一方面，在外交领域，这种做法可能会被其他国家视为帝国主义行径。

Intelligence policy is related to defense and includes the overt and covert gathering of information from foreign sources that might be of strategic interest to the United States. The intelligence world, perhaps more than any other area of foreign policy, captures the imagination of the general public. Many books, television shows, and movies entertain us (with varying degrees of accuracy) through stories about U.S. intelligence operations and people.

[.my2]
情报政策与国防息息相关，包括公开和秘密地从外国渠道收集可能对美国具有战略意义的信息。 情报领域或许比外交政策的其他任何领域都更能吸引公众的想象力。许多书籍、电视节目和电影（尽管真实程度不一）都通过讲述美国情报行动和人员的故事来娱乐我们。

Foreign aid and global environmental policy are the final two foreign policy types. With both, as with the other types, the United States operates as a strategic actor with its own interests in mind, but here it also acts as an international steward trying to serve the common good. With foreign aid, the United States provides material and economic aid to other countries, especially developing countries, in order to improve their stability and their citizens’ quality of life. This type of aid is sometimes called humanitarian aid; in 2013 the U.S. contribution totaled $32 billion. Military aid is classified under military/defense or national security policy (and totaled $8 billion in 2013). At $40 billion the total U.S. foreign aid budget for 2013 was sizeable, though it represented less than 1 percent of the entire federal budget.6
对外援助和全球环境政策是外交政策的最后两种类型。与其他类型一样，美国在这两种政策中都扮演着战略行动者的角色，以自身利益为出发点，但同时，它也扮演着国际管理者的角色，力求服务于共同利益。在对外援助方面，美国向其他国家，特别是发展中国家，提供物质和经济援助，以改善其稳定和人民的生活质量。这种援助有时被称为人道主义援助；2013 年，美国的援助总额为 320 亿美元。军事援助被归类于军事/国防或国家安全政策（2013 年总额为 80 亿美元）。2013 年，美国对外援助预算总额为 400 亿美元，数额相当可观，但仅占联邦预算总额的不到 1%。 6

Global environmental policy addresses world-level environmental matters such as climate change and global warming, the thinning of the ozone layer, rainforest depletion in areas along the Equator, and ocean pollution and species extinction. The United States’ commitment to such issues has varied considerably over the years. For example, the United States was the largest country not to sign the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse gas emissions. However, few would argue that the U.S. government has not been a leader on global environmental matters. The Paris Agreement on climate change took effect in late 2016. The pact establishes a framework to prevent further climate change, namely to limit the rise in overall global temperature. The agreement was negotiated during the Obama administration and the U.S. signed on initially. However, President Trump officially withdrew the U.S. from the pact in November 2020. Early in 2021, the newly elected president, Joe Biden, rejoined the Paris Agreement with a commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030.7
全球环境政策旨在应对气候变化和全球变暖、臭氧层变薄、赤道沿线雨林退化、海洋污染和物种灭绝等世界层面的环境问题。多年来，美国对这些问题的承诺变化不定。例如，美国是未签署 1997 年《京都议定书》（关于温室气体排放）的最大国家。然而，很少有人会否认美国政府在全球环境问题上一直扮演着领导角色。 《巴黎气候协定》 于 2016 年底生效。该协定建立了一个框架，旨在防止气候变化进一步加剧，即限制全球气温的上升。该协定是在奥巴马政府时期谈判达成的，美国最初也签署了该协定。然而，特朗普总统于 2020 年 11 月正式宣布美国退出该协定。2021 年初，新当选的总统乔·拜登重新加入《巴黎协定》，并承诺到 2030 年将温室气体排放量减半 。

UNIQUE CHALLENGES IN FOREIGN POLICY
外交政策中的独特挑战
U.S. foreign policy is a massive and complex enterprise. What are its unique challenges for the country?
美国外交政策是一项庞大而复杂的事业。它给美国带来了哪些独特的挑战？

First, there exists no true world-level authority dictating how the nations of the world should relate to one another. If one nation negotiates in bad faith or lies to another, there is no central world-level government authority to sanction that country. This makes diplomacy and international coordination an ongoing bargain as issues evolve and governmental leaders and nations change. Foreign relations are certainly made smoother by the existence of cross-national voluntary associations like the United Nations, the Organization of American States, and the African Union. However, these associations do not have strict enforcement authority over specific nations, unless a group of member nations takes action in some manner (which is ultimately voluntary).

[.my2]
首先，并不存在一个真正意义上的世界级权威机构来规定世界各国之间的关系。如果一个国家谈判不诚信或对另一个国家撒谎，并没有一个中央级的世界政府机构可以对其进行制裁。这使得外交和国际协调成为一项持续不断的博弈，因为问题会不断演变，政府领导人和国家也会更迭。联合国、 美洲国家组织和非洲联盟等跨国自愿性组织的存在无疑有助于促进外交关系的顺畅发展。然而，除非一些成员国采取某种行动（而这种行动最终也是自愿的），否则这些组织对特定国家并没有严格的强制执行力。

The European Union is the single supranational entity with some real and significant authority over its member nations. Adoption of its common currency, the euro, brings with it concessions from countries on a variety of matters, and the EU’s economic and environmental regulations are the strictest in the world. Yet even the EU has enforcement issues, as evidenced by the battle within its ranks to force member Greece to reduce its national debt or the recurring problem of Spain overfishing in the North Atlantic Ocean. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit, short for British exit) also points to the struggles that supra-national institutions like the EU can face.

[.my2]
欧盟是唯一一个对成员国拥有切实且重要权威的超国家实体。采用共同货币欧元促使成员国在诸多方面做出让步，欧盟的经济和环境法规也是世界上最严格的。然而，即使是欧盟也存在执行方面的问题，例如其内部为迫使成员国希腊减少国债而进行的斗争，以及西班牙在北大西洋过度捕捞问题反复出现的情况。英国退出欧盟（通常被称为“脱欧”，即英国退出欧盟的简称）也表明了像欧盟这样的超国家机构可能面临的挑战。

International relations take place in a relatively open venue in which it is seldom clear how to achieve collective action among countries generally or between the United States and specific other nations in particular. When does it make sense to sign a multinational pact and when doesn’t it? Is a particular bilateral economic agreement truly as beneficial to the United States as to the other party, or are we giving away too much in the deal? These are open and complicated questions, which the various schools of thought discussed later in the chapter will help us answer.

[.my2]
国际关系在一个相对开放的环境中展开，如何达成国家间的集体行动，尤其是美国与特定国家间的集体行动，往往并不明朗。何时签署多边协定才有意义，何时又不有意义？一项双边经济协议对美国是否真的像对另一方那样有利？或者我们在协议中是否做出了过多的让步？这些都是开放且复杂的问题，本章后续讨论的各种思想流派将有助于我们解答这些问题。

A second challenge for the United States is the widely differing views among countries about the role of government in people’s lives. The government of hardline communist North Korea regulates everything in its people’s lives every day. At the other end of the spectrum are countries with little government activity at all, such as parts of the island of New Guinea. In between is a vast array of diverse approaches to governance. Countries like Sweden provide cradle-to-grave human services programs like health care and education that in some parts of India are minimal at best. In Egypt, the nonprofit sector provides many services rather than the government. The United States relishes its tradition of freedom and the principle of limited government, but practice and reality can be somewhat different. In the end, it falls somewhere in the middle of this continuum because of its focus on law and order, educational and training services, and old-age pensions and health care in the form of Social Security and Medicare.

[.my2]
美国面临的第二个挑战是各国对政府在人民生活中扮演的角色存在巨大分歧。强硬的共产主义朝鲜政府每天对人民生活的方方面面都进行管控。而与之形成鲜明对比的是，一些国家几乎没有政府干预，例如新几内亚岛的部分地区。介于两者之间的是各种各样不同的治理方式。像瑞典这样的国家提供从摇篮到坟墓的全民公共服务项目，例如医疗保健和教育，而印度某些地区的这些服务充其量也只是微乎其微。在埃及，许多服务是由非营利组织而非政府提供的。美国珍视其自由传统和有限政府原则，但实践与现实可能存在差异。最终，由于美国注重法律和秩序、教育和培训服务以及以社会保障和医疗保险形式提供的养老金和医疗保健，其治理方式大致处于这一连续谱的中间位置。

The challenge of pinpointing the appropriate role of government may sound more like a domestic than a foreign policy matter, and to some degree it is an internal choice about the way government interacts with the people. Yet the internal (or domestic) relationship between a government and its people can often become intertwined with foreign policy. For example, the narrow stance on personal liberty that Iran has taken in recent decades led other countries to impose economic sanctions that crippled the country internally. Some of these sanctions have eased in light of the new nuclear deal with Iran. So the domestic and foreign policy realms are intertwined in terms of what we view as national priorities—whether they consist of nation building abroad or infrastructure building here at home, for example. This latter choice is often described as the “guns versus butter” debate.

[.my2]
确定政府的恰当角色这一挑战，听起来更像是内政而非外交问题，在某种程度上，这关乎政府与民众互动方式的内部选择。然而，政府与其民众之间的内部（或国内）关系往往与外交政策交织在一起。例如，伊朗近几十年来对个人自由采取的狭隘立场，导致其他国家对其实施经济制裁，严重削弱了伊朗的国内经济。随着与伊朗达成新的核协议，部分制裁有所放松。因此，就我们所看待的国家优先事项而言，内政和外交领域是相互交织的——例如，这些优先事项是海外国家建设还是国内基础设施建设。后一种选择通常被描述为“ 枪炮与黄油 ”之争。

A third, and related, unique challenge for the United States in the foreign policy realm is other countries’ varying ideas about the appropriate form of government. These forms range from democracies on one side to various authoritarian (or nondemocratic) forms of government on the other. Relations between the United States and democratic states tend to operate more smoothly, proceeding from the shared core assumption that government’s authority comes from the people. Monarchies and other nondemocratic forms of government do not share this assumption, which can complicate foreign policy discussions immensely. People in the United States often assume that people who live in a nondemocratic country would prefer to live in a democratic one. However, in some regions of the world, such as the Middle East, this does not seem to be the case—people often prefer having stability within a nondemocratic system over changing to a less predictable democratic form of government. Or they may believe in a theocratic form of government. And the United States does have formal relations with some more totalitarian and monarchical governments, such as Saudi Arabia, when it is in U.S. interests to do so.

[.my2]
美国在外交政策领域面临的第三个独特挑战，也是与之相关的挑战，是其他国家对合适的政府形式持有不同的观点。这些形式涵盖了从民主政体到各种威权（或非民主）政体。美国与民主国家的关系往往更为顺畅，因为它们都基于一个共同的核心假设：政府的权力来源于人民。君主制和其他非民主政体并不认同这一假设，这会极大地复杂化外交政策的讨论。美国人通常认为，生活在非民主国家的人们更倾向于生活在民主国家。然而，在世界某些地区，例如中东，情况似乎并非如此——人们往往更愿意在非民主体制下保持稳定，而不是转向更不稳定的民主政体。或者，他们可能信奉神权政体。当符合美国利益时，美国确实会与一些更专制和君主制的政府（例如沙特阿拉伯）保持正式关系。

A fourth challenge is that many new foreign policy issues transcend borders. That is, there are no longer simply friendly states and enemy states. Problems around the world that might affect the United States, such as terrorism, the international slave trade, and climate change, originate with groups and issues that are not country-specific. They are transnational. So, for example, while we can readily name the enemies of the Allied forces in World War II (Germany, Italy, and Japan), the U.S. war against terrorism has been aimed at terrorist groups that do not fit neatly within the borders of any one country with which the United States could quickly interact to solve the problem. Intelligence-gathering and focused military intervention are needed more than traditional diplomatic relations, and relations can become complicated when the United States wants to pursue terrorists within other countries’ borders. An ongoing example is the use of U.S. drone strikes on terrorist targets within the nation of Pakistan, in addition to the 2011 campaign that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden, the founder of al-Qaeda (Figure 17.6).

[.my2]
第四个挑战是，许多新的外交政策问题超越了国界。也就是说，不再存在简单的友好国家和敌对国家之分。世界各地可能影响美国的问题，例如恐怖主义、国际奴隶贸易和气候变化，其根源并非局限于某个国家，而是跨国性的。例如，虽然我们可以轻易列举出二战中盟军的敌人（德国、意大利和日本），但美国的反恐战争针对的是那些无法被美国迅速与之互动以解决问题的单一国家所定义的恐怖组织。情报收集和有针对性的军事干预比传统的外交关系更为必要，而当美国想要在其他国家境内追捕恐怖分子时，关系就会变得复杂。一个持续的例子是美国在巴基斯坦境内使用无人机打击恐怖分子目标，以及 2011 年导致基地组织创始人奥萨马 ·本·拉登死亡的行动（ 图 17.6 ）。

The fifth and final unique challenge is the varying conditions of the countries in the world and their effect on what is possible in terms of foreign policy and diplomatic relations. Relations between the United States and a stable industrial democracy are going to be easier than between the United States and an unstable developing country being run by a military junta (a group that has taken control of the government by force). Moreover, an unstable country will be more focused on establishing internal stability than on broader world concerns like environmental policy. In fact, developing countries are temporarily exempt from the requirements of certain treaties while they seek to develop stable industrial and governmental frameworks.

[.my2]
第五个也是最后一个独特的挑战是世界各国国情各异，以及这些差异对外交政策和外交关系的影响。美国与一个稳定的工业民主国家的关系，肯定比美国与一个由军政府（通过武力夺取政权的集团）统治的不稳定发展中国家的关系要容易得多。此外，一个不稳定的国家会更专注于建立内部稳定，而不是关注环境政策等更广泛的世界问题。事实上，发展中国家在寻求建立稳定的产业和政府框架期间，可以暂时豁免于某些条约的约束。
