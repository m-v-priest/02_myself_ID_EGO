== 释义




The U.S. Constitution—in particular, the first ten amendments that form the Bill of Rights—protects the freedoms and rights of individuals. It does not limit this protection just to citizens or adults; instead, in most cases, the Constitution simply refers to “persons,” which over time has grown to mean that even children, visitors from other countries, and immigrants—permanent or temporary, legal or undocumented—enjoy the same freedoms when they are in the United States or its territories as adult citizens do. So, whether you are a Japanese tourist visiting Disney World or someone who has stayed beyond the limit of days allowed on your visa, you do not sacrifice your liberties. In everyday conversation, we tend to treat freedoms, liberties, and rights as interchangeable—similar to how separation of powers and checks and balances are often used synonymously, when, in fact, these are distinct concepts.

[.my2]
**美国宪法 ——特别是构成"权利法案"的前十条修正案——保护个人的自由和权利。它并非将这种保护, 仅限于公民或成年人；相反，在大多数情况下，宪法仅提及“人”，随着时间的推移，这意味着即使是儿童、来自其他国家的游客, 以及移民——无论永久或临时、合法或非法——在美国或其领土内都享有与成年公民相同的自由。**因此，无论您是前往迪士尼乐园的日本游客，还是签证过期后仍停留在美国的人，您都不会失去您的自由。在日常对话中，我们往往将自由、权利和权益混为一谈——就像"权力分立和制衡"经常被当作同义词使用一样，而实际上，它们是不同的概念。

=== DEFINING CIVIL LIBERTIES

[.my2]
界定公民自由

To be more precise in their language, political scientists and legal experts make a distinction between civil liberties and civil rights, even though the Constitution has been interpreted to protect both. We typically envision civil liberties as limitations on government power, intended to protect freedoms upon which governments may not legally intrude. For example, the First Amendment denies the government the power to prohibit “the free exercise” of religion. This means that neither states nor the national government can forbid people to follow a religion of their choice, even if politicians and judges think the religion is misguided, blasphemous, or otherwise inappropriate. Unlike most of the rest of world at the time, U.S. citizens could even create their own faiths and recruit followers to them (subject to the U.S. Supreme Court deeming it a religion), even if both society and government disapprove of its tenets. That said, the way you practice your religion, like any other practice, may be regulated if it impinges on the rights of others. To return to the previous example, religious communities may believe their faith will protect them and loved ones from disease, but they may not have the right to both not vaccinate their children and have those children publicly educated, where they would pose a risk to others. The Eighth Amendment says the government cannot impose “cruel and unusual punishments” on individuals for their criminal acts. Although the definitions of cruel and unusual have expanded over the years, the courts have generally and consistently interpreted this provision as making it unconstitutional for government officials to torture suspects. As we will see later in this chapter, courts are currently debating the degree to which extended solitary confinement and certain forms of capital punishment might count as cruel and unusual.

[.my2]
更准确地说，**政治学家和法律专家, 区分了"公民自由"和"公民权利"，**尽管宪法已被解释为"同时保护这两者"。**#我们通常将"公民自由"理解为"对'政府权力'的限制"，旨在保护政府不得合法侵犯的自由。#**例如，##**第一修正案禁止政府"禁止宗教自由"。##这意味着，无论州政府还是联邦政府, 都不能禁止人们信奉自己选择的宗教，##即使政客和法官认为该宗教是错误的、亵渎神明的, 或其他不恰当的(所以"法轮功"在美国就不被取缔)。**##与当时世界上大多数国家不同，*美国公民甚至可以创立自己的信仰,并招募信徒*（前提是美国最高法院认定其为宗教），**即使社会和政府都不认可其教义。**也就是说，你实践宗教的方式 ，如同任何其他行为一样，**#如果侵犯了他人的权利，则可能会受到监管。#**回到之前的例子，宗教团体可能相信, 他们的信仰能够保护他们和亲人免受疾病侵害，但他们可能没有权利既不给孩子接种疫苗，又让这些孩子接受公共教育，因为在公共教育场所，这些孩子会对他人构成风险。*美国宪法第八修正案规定，政府不得对犯罪行为施加“残酷和不寻常的惩罚”。尽管“ 残酷和不寻常 ”的定义近年来有所扩展，但法院通常且始终如一地将此条款, 解释为"禁止政府官员对嫌疑人施以酷刑"。* 正如我们将在本章后面看到的那样，*目前，法院正在辩论, 长期单独监禁和某些形式的死刑, 在多大程度上可能构成"残酷和不寻常的惩罚"。*

Civil rights, on the other hand, are guarantees that government officials will treat people equally and that decisions will be made on the basis of merit rather than race, gender, or other personal characteristics. Because of the Constitution’s civil rights guarantee, it is unlawful for any publicly-funded entity, such as a school or state university, or even a landlord or potential landlord to treat people differently based on their race, ethnicity, age, sex, or national origin. In the 1960s and 1970s, many states had separate schools where only students of a certain race or gender were able to study. However, the courts decided that these policies violated the civil rights of students who could not be admitted because of those rules. In 2017, the Trump administration began enacting a policy at border entries in El Paso that entailed separating undocumented parents and children as they entered the United States. They expanded that policy in 2018. Today, the government continues to try to reunite families who were separated during that time.

[.my2]
另一方面，##** "公民权利", 保障"政府官员能平等对待所有人"，并确保决策基于"能力"而"非种族、性别或其他个人特征"。**##由于宪法保障公民权利，任何公共资助机构，例如学校或州立大学，甚至##**房东或潜在房东，都不得基于种族、民族、年龄、性别或国籍, 区别对待他人。**##在 20 世纪 60 年代和 70 年代，许多州都设有"种族隔离学校"，只允许特定种族或性别的学生就读。然而，法院裁定这些政策侵犯了"因这些规定而被拒之门外的学生"的公民权利。  2017 年，特朗普政府开始在埃尔帕索边境口岸, 实施一项政策，将"非法入境美国的父母"和子女分开。2018 年，该政策进一步扩大。如今，政府仍在努力让那些在此期间被迫分离的家庭团聚。


The idea that Americans—indeed, people in general—have fundamental rights and liberties was at the core of the arguments in favor of their independence. In writing the Declaration of Independence in 1776, Thomas Jefferson drew on the ideas of English philosopher John Locke to express the colonists’ belief that they had certain inalienable or natural rights that no ruler had the power or authority to deny to their subjects. It was a scathing legal indictment of King George III for violating the colonists’ liberties. Although the Declaration of Independence does not guarantee specific freedoms, its language was instrumental in inspiring many of the states to adopt protections for civil liberties and rights in their own constitutions, and in expressing principles of the founding era that have resonated in the United States since its independence. In particular, Jefferson’s words “all men are created equal” became the centerpiece of struggles for the rights of women and minorities (Figure 4.2).

[.my2]
美国人——乃至所有人——拥有"基本权利和自由"的理念，是支持"美国独立"的核心论点。1776 年，托马斯 ·杰斐逊在撰写**#《 独立宣言》#** 时，借鉴了英国哲学家约翰 ·洛克的思想，**##表达了殖民地居民的信念：他们拥有某些不可剥夺的"自然权利"，任何统治者都无权剥夺其臣民的这些权利。##这份宣言严厉谴责了乔治三世国王侵犯殖民地居民自由的行为。##尽管《独立宣言》并未具体规定哪些自由，#**但其措辞, 对许多州在其宪法中纳入"公民自由和权利"的保护条款, 起到了至关重要的作用，也体现了建国时期的一些原则，这些原则自美国独立以来, 一直影响着美国。尤其值得一提的是，杰斐逊的“人人生而平等”, 成为了争取妇女和少数族裔权利斗争的核心（ 图 4.2 ）。

Founded in 1920, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is one of the oldest interest groups in the United States. The mission of this non-partisan, not-for-profit organization is “to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed to every person in this country by the Constitution and laws of the United States.” Many of the Supreme Court cases in this chapter were litigated by, or with the support of, the ACLU. The ACLU offers a listing of state and local chapters on their website.

=== CIVIL LIBERTIES AND THE CONSTITUTION

[.my2]
公民自由与宪法

The Constitution as drafted in 1787 did not include a Bill of Rights, although the idea of including one was proposed and, after brief discussion, dismissed in the final week of the Constitutional Convention. The framers of the Constitution believed they faced much more pressing concerns than the protection of civil rights and liberties—most notably keeping the fragile union together in the light of internal unrest and external threats.

[.my2]
*1787 年起草的宪法草案中, 并未包含"权利法案" ，尽管有人提出过加入"权利法案"的想法，但在制宪会议的最后一周经过短暂讨论后，该提议被否决了。宪法的制定者们认为，他们面临着比"保护公民权利和自由"更为紧迫的问题——尤其是在内部动荡和外部威胁的背景下，如何维护脆弱的联邦统一。*

Moreover, the framers thought that they had adequately covered rights issues in the main body of the document. Indeed, the Federalists did include in the Constitution some protections against legislative acts that might restrict the liberties of citizens, based on the history of real and perceived abuses by both British kings and parliaments as well as royal governors. In Article I, Section 9, the Constitution limits the power of Congress in three ways: prohibiting the passage of bills of attainder, prohibiting ex post facto laws, and limiting the ability of Congress to suspend the writ of habeas corpus.

[.my2]
此外，制宪者认为, 他们在宪法正文中已经充分涵盖了权利问题。**事实上，联邦党人确实在宪法中加入了一些保护条款，以防止"立法行为限制公民的自由"，这些条款是基于英国国王、议会, 以及皇家总督, 在历史上实际或被认为存在的滥用权力行为, 而制定的。**宪法第一条第九款, #*从三个方面限制了国会的权力：禁止通过"剥夺公民权利"法案、禁止制定"事后法", 以及限制国会"中止人身保护令"的权力。*#

A bill of attainder is a law that convicts or punishes someone for a crime without a trial, a tactic used fairly frequently in England against the king’s enemies. Prohibition of such laws means that the U.S. Congress cannot simply punish people who are unpopular or who seem to be guilty of crimes. An ex post facto law has a retroactive effect: it can be used to punish crimes that were not crimes at the time they were committed, or it can be used to increase the severity of punishment after the fact.

[.my2]
*##"剥夺公民权"法案, 是指未经审判, 就对某人定罪或处罚的法律，这种策略在英国曾被频繁用于对付国王的敌人。##禁止此类法律, 意味着"美国国会"不能随意惩罚那些不受欢迎或看似有罪的人。 #"事后法"具有追溯效力：它可以用来惩罚在"当时并非犯罪的行为"，也可以用来"事后加重刑罚"。(法不溯及既往)#*

Finally, the writ of habeas corpus is used in our common-law legal system to demand that a neutral judge decide whether someone has been lawfully detained. Particularly in times of war, or even in response to threats against national security, the government has held suspected enemy agents without access to civilian courts, often without access to lawyers or a defense, seeking instead to try them before military tribunals or detain them indefinitely without trial. For example, during the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln detained suspected Confederate saboteurs and sympathizers in Union-controlled states and attempted to have them tried in military courts, leading the Supreme Court to rule in Ex parte Milligan that the government could not bypass the civilian court system in states where it was operating.3 In 1919, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes was the lone dissenter in the Abrams v. United States decision that convicted four, young, antiwar activists for pamphleteering against U.S. involvement in the Russian Civil War, which now would be exercised as a clear case of freedom of speech.

[.my2]
最后，在我们的"普通法"法律体系中， **"人身保护令"用于要求中立的法官, 裁定某人是否被合法拘留。尤其是在战争时期，甚至在国家安全受到威胁时，政府会拘留被怀疑为"敌方特工"的人，不让他们诉诸民事法庭，通常也无法获得律师或辩护，而是试图在"军事法庭"审判他们，或者无限期拘留他们, 而不经审判。**例如，在内战期间，亚伯拉罕·林肯总统在联邦控制的州, 拘留了被怀疑为南方邦联破坏分子和同情者的嫌疑人，并试图在军事法庭审判他们，这导致最高法院在“米利根案 ”（Ex parte Milligan） 中裁定，*政府不能绕过"其运作所在州的民事法院系统"。* 1919 年，大法官奥利弗·温德尔·霍姆斯, 是艾布拉姆斯诉美国案中唯一的反对者。 该案判处四名年轻的反战活动家有罪，罪名是散发小册子, 反对美国卷入俄国内战。而**现在，这种行为被视为"言论自由"的明确体现。** (军事法庭与民事法庭有何区别?)

During World War II, the Roosevelt administration interned Japanese Americans and had other suspected enemy agents—including U.S. citizens—tried by military courts rather than by the civilian justice system, a choice the Supreme Court upheld in Ex parte Quirin (Figure 4.3). More recently, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the Bush and Obama administrations detained suspected terrorists captured both within and outside the United States and sought to avoid trials in civilian courts, and surveilled U.S. citizens to detect threats. Hence, there have been times in our history when national security issues trumped individual liberties.

[.my2]
二战期间，罗斯福政府将日裔美国人拘禁，并让其他被怀疑是敌方特工的人——包括美国公民——接受"军事法庭"而非"民事司法系统"的审判，最高法院在“奎林案”（ Ex parte Quirin ， 图 4.3 ）中维持了这一做法。  近期，**在 9·11 恐怖袭击事件发生后，布什和奥巴马政府拘留了在美国境内外抓获的恐怖嫌疑人，并试图避免在"民事法庭"接受审判，**同时对美国公民进行监视, 以发现威胁。因此，在我们的历史上，"国家安全问题"凌驾于"个人自由"之上的情况, 时有发生。

Debate has always swirled over these issues. The Federalists reasoned that the limited set of named or enumerated powers of Congress, along with the limitations on those powers in Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution, would suffice, and that no separate bill of rights was needed. Writing as Publius in Federalist No. 84, Alexander Hamilton argued that the Constitution was “merely intended to regulate the general political interests of the nation” rather than contend with “the regulation of every species of personal and private concerns.” Hamilton went on to argue that listing some rights might actually be dangerous, because it would provide a pretext for people to claim that rights not included in such a list were not protected. Later, James Madison, in his speech introducing the proposed amendments that would become the Bill of Rights, acknowledged another Federalist argument: “It has been said, that a bill of rights is not necessary, because the establishment of this government has not repealed those declarations of rights which are added to the several state constitutions.” Neither had the Articles of Confederation included a specific listing of rights, even if it was predictable that state governments would differ in what they would tolerate, grant, and prohibit among their citizens.

[.my2]
*围绕这些问题的争论由来已久。* 联邦党人认为，宪法中已列举的国会有限的权力，以及宪法第一条第九款对这些权力的限制，已经足够，无需单独制定"权利法案"。**亚历山大· 汉密尔顿**以"普布利乌斯"的笔名在 《联邦党人文集》 第 84 篇中**指出，宪法的“目的, 仅仅在于规范国家的总体政治利益”，而非“规范各种个人和私人事务”。汉密尔顿进一步论证，#列举某些权利, 实际上可能很危险，因为这会为人们提供借口，声称'未列入清单的权利'不受保护。(说死反而不好, 要模糊化, 以后才有操作空间.)#**后来，詹姆斯 ·麦迪逊在介绍最终成为"权利法案"的修正案的演讲中，也承认了**联邦党人的另一个论点：“有人说，权利法案没有必要，因为本届政府的建立, 并没有废除各州宪法中附加的权利宣言。”**  邦联条例也没有列出具体的权利清单，尽管可以预见的是，各州政府对于容忍、授予和禁止其公民的权利, 会有所不同。

Anti-Federalists argued that the Federalists’ position was incorrect and perhaps even insincere. The Anti-Federalists believed provisions such as the so-called elastic clause in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution would allow Congress to legislate on matters well beyond those foreseen by the Constitution’s authors. Thus, they held that a bill of rights was necessary. One of the Anti-Federalists, Brutus, whom most scholars believe to be Robert Yates, wrote: “The powers, rights, and authority, granted to the general government by this Constitution, are as complete, with respect to every object to which they extend, as that of any state government—It reaches to every thing which concerns human happiness—Life, liberty, and property, are under its controul [sic]. There is the same reason, therefore, that the exercise of power, in this case, should be restrained within proper limits, as in that of the state governments.” The experience of the past two centuries has suggested that the Anti-Federalists may have been correct in this regard. While the states retain a great deal of importance, the scope and powers of the national government are much broader today than in 1787—likely beyond even the imaginings of the Federalists themselves.

[.my2]
**#反联邦主义者认为,# "联邦主义者"的立场是错误的，甚至可能是虚伪的。他们认为，#宪法第一条第八款中所谓的“弹性条款”等规定，将允许国会就远远超出宪法制定者预见范围的事项, 进行立法。因此，他们认为有必要制定"权利法案"。#**一位名叫布鲁图斯 （Brutus ）的反联邦主义者（大多数学者认为他就是罗伯特 ·耶茨 ）写道：“本宪法赋予联邦政府的权力、权利和权威，就其所涵盖的每一个方面而言，都与任何州政府一样完备——它涵盖了关乎人类幸福的一切——生命、自由和财产, 都在其掌控之下。因此，联邦政府行使权力, 应当像州政府一样，受到适当的限制。”  #*过去两个世纪的经验表明，反联邦主义者在这方面的观点或许是正确的。虽然各州仍然非常重要，但如今国家政府的范围和权力, 比 1787 年要大得多——甚至可能超出了联邦党人自己的想象。*#

The struggle to have rights clearly delineated and the decision of the framers to omit a bill of rights from the Constitution nearly derailed the ratification process. While some of the states were willing to ratify without any further guarantees, in some of the larger states—New York and Virginia in particular—the Constitution’s lack of specified rights became a serious point of contention. The Constitution could go into effect with the support of only nine states, but the Federalists knew it could not be effective without the participation of the largest states. To secure majorities in favor of ratification in New York and Virginia, as well as Massachusetts, they agreed to consider incorporating provisions suggested by the ratifying states as amendments to the Constitution.

[.my2]
争取"明确界定各项权利"的努力，以及制宪者决定在宪法中省略"权利法案"，几乎使批准程序陷入僵局。虽然一些州愿意在没有任何进一步保障的情况下批准宪法，但在一些大州——尤其是纽约州和弗吉尼亚州——宪法缺乏明确规定的权利, 成为了一个严重的争议点。**宪法只需九个州的支持即可生效，但联邦党人深知，如果没有大州的参与，宪法就无法有效实施。**为了确保纽约州、弗吉尼亚州, 以及马萨诸塞州的多数州支持批准，他们同意考虑将"已批准州提出的条款", 作为"宪法修正案"纳入宪法。

Ultimately, James Madison delivered on this promise by proposing a package of amendments in the First Congress, drawing from the Declaration of Rights in the Virginia state constitution, suggestions from the ratification conventions, and other sources. Each of these were extensively debated in both houses of Congress and, ultimately, proposed as twelve separate amendments for ratification by the states. Ten of the amendments were successfully ratified by the requisite 75 percent of the states and became known as the Bill of Rights (Table 4.1).

[.my2]
最终，詹姆斯·麦迪逊兑现了这一承诺，*在第一届国会提出了一系列修正案，这些修正案, 借鉴了弗吉尼亚州宪法中的权利宣言、各州批准宪法会议的建议, 以及其他来源。每一项修正案都在国会两院经过了广泛的辩论，最终被提出作为十二项独立的修正案，供各州批准。其中十项修正案获得了 75%州的批准，并被统称为《 权利法案 》*（ 表 4.1 ）。

Finding a Middle Ground

Debating the Need for a Bill of Rights

[.my2]
辩论"是否需要权利法案"

One of the most serious debates between the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists was over the necessity of limiting the power of the new federal government with a Bill of Rights. As we saw in this section, the Federalists believed a Bill of Rights was unnecessary—and perhaps even dangerous to liberty, because it might invite violations of rights that weren’t included in it—while the Anti-Federalists thought the national government would prove adept at expanding its powers and influence and that citizens couldn’t depend on the good judgment of Congress alone to protect their rights.

[.my2]
**联邦党人和反联邦党人之间最激烈的辩论之一，是关于是否有必要通过《权利法案》, 来限制新成立的联邦政府的权力。**正如我们在本节中所看到的，*#联邦党人认为《权利法案》没有必要——甚至可能对"自由"构成威胁，因为它可能会导致侵犯法案中未涵盖的权利——而"反联邦党人"则认为，联邦政府会善于扩张其权力和影响力，公民不能仅仅依靠国会的良好判断, 来保护自身的权利(即不能天真的相信国会天然会有善意, 来保障人民的权力. 因为"人选是靠不住的")。#*

As George Washington’s call for a bill of rights in his first inaugural address suggested, while the Federalists ultimately had to add the Bill of Rights to the Constitution in order to win ratification, the Anti-Federalists' fear that the national government might intrude on civil liberties proved to be prescient. In 1798, at the behest of President John Adams during the Quasi-War with France, Congress passed a series of four laws collectively known as the Alien and Sedition Acts. These laws were drafted to allow the president to imprison or deport foreign citizens that he believed were “dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States” and to restrict speech and newspaper articles critical of the federal government or its officials. The laws were primarily used against members and supporters of the opposition, the Democratic-Republican Party.

[.my2]
正如乔治·华盛顿在其首次就职演说中, 呼吁制定"权利法案"所表明的那样，尽管联邦党人最终不得不将"权利法案"加入, 宪法才能获得批准，但**反联邦党人对联邦政府可能侵犯公民自由的担忧, 最终被证明的确是"先见之明"。**1798年，在与法国的准战争期间，应约翰·亚当斯总统的要求，国会通过了一系列四项法律，统称为《外国人法》和《煽动叛乱法》。这些法律旨在允许总统监禁或驱逐他认为“对美国和平与安全构成威胁”的外国公民，并限制"批评联邦政府或其官员的言论和报纸文章"。这些法律主要被用来针对反对党"民主共和党"的成员和支持者。

State laws and constitutions protecting free speech and freedom of the press proved ineffective in limiting this new federal power. Although the courts did not decide on the constitutionality of these laws at the time, most scholars believe the Sedition Act, in particular, would be ruled unconstitutional if it had remained in effect. Three of the four laws were repealed in the Jefferson administration, but one—the Alien Enemies Act—remains on the books today. Two centuries later, the issue of free speech and freedom of the press during times of international conflict remains a subject of intense public debate.

[.my2]
各州"保护言论自由和新闻自由的法律和宪法", 未能有效限制这项新的联邦权力。尽管当时法院并未就这些法律的合宪性作出裁决，但**大多数学者认为，如果《煽动叛乱法》继续生效，尤其会被裁定违宪。这四项法律中的三项, 在杰斐逊政府时期被废除，但其中一项——《敌侨法》——至今仍然有效。**两个世纪后，在国际冲突时期，言论自由和新闻自由的问题, 仍然是公众激烈辩论的话题。

Should the government be able to restrict or censor unpatriotic, disloyal, or critical speech in times of international conflict? What about from government whistle-blowers or employees who leak sensitive information? How much freedom should journalists have to report on stories from the perspective of enemies or to repeat propaganda from opposing forces?

[.my2]
在国际冲突时期，政府是否有权限制或审查不爱国、不忠诚, 或批评性的言论？对于泄露敏感信息的政府举报人或雇员，又该如何处理？记者在多大程度上可以自由地从敌方视角报道新闻, 或传播敌对势力的宣传？

=== EXTENDING THE BILL OF RIGHTS TO THE STATES

[.my2]
将"权利法案"扩展至各州


In the decades following the Constitution’s ratification, the Supreme Court declined to expand the Bill of Rights to curb the power of the states, most notably in the 1833 case of Barron v. Baltimore. In this case, which dealt with property rights under the Fifth Amendment, the Supreme Court unanimously decided that the Bill of Rights applied only to actions by the federal government, not state or local governments. Explaining the court’s ruling, Chief Justice John Marshall wrote that it was incorrect to argue that “the Constitution was intended to secure the people of the several states against the undue exercise of power by their respective state governments; as well as against that which might be attempted by their [Federal] government.”

[.my2]
**#在宪法批准后的几十年里， 最高法院拒绝扩大"权利法案"的适用范围, 以限制各州的权力，#**其中最著名的案例是 1833 年的巴伦诉巴尔的摩案。  在该案中，**#最高法院一致裁定 ，"权利法案"仅适用于联邦政府的行为，而不适用于州政府或地方政府。#**首席大法官约翰· 马歇尔在解释法院的裁决时写道，认为“宪法的目的是为了'保障各州人民免受各自州政府滥用权力，以及免受联邦政府可能滥用权力'”的观点是错误的。

The festering issue of the rights of enslaved persons and the convulsions of the Civil War and its aftermath forced a reexamination of the prevailing thinking about the application of the Bill of Rights to the states. Soon after slavery was abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment, state governments—particularly those in the former Confederacy—began to pass “Black codes” that restricted the rights of formerly enslaved people, including the right to hold office, own land, or vote, relegating them to second-class citizenship. Angered by these actions, members of the Radical Republican faction in Congress demanded that the Black codes be overturned. In the short term, they advocated suspending civilian government in most of the southern states and replacing politicians who had enacted these discriminatory laws. Their long-term solution was to propose and enforce two amendments to the Constitution to guarantee the rights of freed men and women. These became the Fourteenth Amendment, which dealt with civil liberties and rights in general, and the Fifteenth Amendment, which protected the right to vote in particular (Figure 4.4). though still not for women or Native Americans.

[.my2]
奴隶的权利问题, 长期存在，加上内战及其战后局势的动荡，迫使人们重新审视当时关于《权利法案》在各州适用性的普遍观点。 **第十三修正案废除奴隶制后不久，各州政府——尤其是前南方邦联各州——开始颁布“黑人法典”，限制前奴隶的权利，包括"担任公职、拥有土地和投票"的权利，将他们降为二等公民。国会激进共和党成员对此感到愤怒，要求废除“黑人法典”。**短期内，他们主张暂停南方大多数州的文官政府，并撤换那些颁布歧视性法律的政客。他们的长期解决方案是: 提出并实施两项宪法修正案，以保障获得自由的男女的权利。这些条款, 最终形成了第十四修正案 （涉及公民自由和权利）, 和第十五修正案 （特别保护了投票权）（ 图 4.4 ），尽管妇女和美洲原住民仍然没有投票权。

Figure 4.4 Representative John Bingham (R-OH) (a) is considered the author of the Fourteenth Amendment, adopted on July 9, 1868. Influenced by his mentor, Salmon P. Chase, Bingham was a strong supporter of the antislavery cause. After Chase lost the Republican presidential nomination to Abraham Lincoln (b), Bingham became one of the president’s most ardent supporters.

With the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, the scope and limits of civil liberties became clearer. First, the amendment says, “no State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States,” which is a provision that echoes the privileges and immunities clause in Article IV, Section 2 of the original Constitution ensuring that states treat citizens of other states the same as their own citizens. (To use an example from today, the punishment for speeding by an out-of-state driver cannot be more severe than the punishment for an in-state driver). Legal scholars and the courts have extensively debated the meaning of this privileges or immunities clause over the years, with some arguing that it was supposed to extend the entire Bill of Rights (or at least the first eight amendments) to the states, and others arguing that only some rights are extended. In 1999, Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for a majority of the Supreme Court, argued in Saenz v. Roe that the clause protects the right to travel from one state to another. More recently, Justice Clarence Thomas argued in the 2010 McDonald v. Chicago ruling that the individual right to bear arms applied to the states because of this clause.

随着 1868 年**第十四修正案**的批准，公民自由的范围和界限, 变得更加清晰。首先，**该修正案规定，“任何州都不得制定或执行'任何剥夺美国公民特权或豁免权'的法律”，**这一条款, 与原宪法第四条第二款中的特权和豁免条款相呼应，*#确保各州对待"其他州的公民", 与对待"本州公民"一视同仁。#*（以今天的例子为例，#*外州司机超速行驶的处罚, 不得比本州司机超速行驶的处罚更重。*#）多年来，**法学学者和法院就这一特权和豁免条款的含义, 展开了广泛的辩论，**一些人认为, 该条款旨在将整部"权利法案" （或至少前八条修正案）扩展到各州，而另一些人则认为, 只有"部分权利"被扩展到各州。 1999 年，约翰·保罗· 史蒂文斯大法官代表最高法院多数派, 在 “萨恩斯诉罗伊案” 中指出，该条款保护公民跨州旅行的权利。  近期，克拉伦斯 ·托马斯大法官在 2010 年 “麦克唐纳诉芝加哥案” *的判决中认为，由于该条款的存在，个人持有武器的权利, 也适用于各州。*

The second provision of the Fourteenth Amendment pertaining to the application of the Bill of Rights to the states is the due process clause, which famously reads, “nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” Like the Fifth Amendment, this clause refers to “due process,” a term that is interpreted to require both access to procedural justice (such as the right to a trial) as well as the more substantive implication that people be treated fairly and impartially by government officials. Although the text of the provision does not mention rights specifically, the courts have held in a series of cases that due process also implies that there are certain fundamental liberties that cannot be denied by the states. For example, in Sherbert v. Verner (1963), the Supreme Court ruled that states could not deny unemployment benefits to an individual who turned down a job because it required working on the Sabbath.

*第十四修正案中关于"权利法案"在各州适用的第二项条款, 是"正当程序"条款 ，其著名之处在于：“任何州都不得未经正当法律程序, 剥夺任何人的生命、自由或财产。”* 与第五修正案一样，该条款也提及“正当程序”，**这一术语的解释, 既包括"获得程序正义"（例如受审权）的权利，也包含更深层次的含义，即政府官员应公平公正地对待民众。**尽管该条款的文本并未明确提及权利，但法院在一系列案例中裁定，**"正当程序"也意味着存在某些基本自由，各州不得剥夺这些自由。**例如，在谢伯特诉弗纳案（1963 年）中，**最高法院裁定，各州不得因某人拒绝一份需要在安息日工作的工作, 而拒绝向其发放失业救济金。 **

Beginning in 1897, the Supreme Court has found that various provisions of the Bill of Rights protecting these fundamental liberties must be upheld by the states, even if their state constitutions and laws (and the Tenth Amendment itself) do not protect them as fully as the Bill of Rights does—or at all. This means there has been a process of selective incorporation of the Bill of Rights into the practices of the states: the Constitution effectively inserts parts of the Bill of Rights into state laws and constitutions, even though it doesn’t do so explicitly. When cases arise to clarify particular issues and procedures, the Supreme Court decides whether state laws violate the Bill of Rights and are therefore unconstitutional.

自 1897 年起，##**最高法院裁定，各州必须维护《权利法案》中保护这些基本自由的各项条款，即便各州的宪法和法律（以及第十修正案本身）对这些自由的保护力度, 不及《权利法案》，甚至根本没有保护。这意味着，各州在实践中, 选择性地纳入了《权利法案》的内容：宪法实际上将《权利法案》的部分内容, 纳入了各州的法律和宪法，**##尽管它并未明确规定这一点。当出现"需要澄清特定问题和程序的案件"时，#*最高法院会裁定"州法律"是否违反了《权利法案》，从而判断其是否违宪。*#

For example, under the Fifth Amendment, a person can be tried in federal court for a felony—a serious crime—only after a grand jury issues an indictment indicating that it is reasonable to try them. (A grand jury is a group of citizens charged with deciding whether there is enough evidence of a crime to prosecute someone.) The Supreme Court has ruled that states don’t have to use grand juries as long as they ensure people accused of crimes are indicted using an equally fair process.

例如，根据第五修正案 ，只有在"联邦大陪审团"发出起诉书，表明审判某人是合理的之后，才能在联邦法院, 对"重罪（即严重犯罪）被告人"进行审判。（#*"联邦大陪审团"是由一群公民组成的，负责决定是否有足够的证据, 对某人提起诉讼。*#）最高法院裁定，各州无需使用"联邦大陪审团"，只要确保对"被控犯罪的人"采用同样公平的程序进行起诉即可。

Selective incorporation is an ongoing process. When the Supreme Court initially decided in 2008 that the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to keep and bear arms, it did not decide then that it was a fundamental liberty the states must uphold as well. It was only in the McDonald v. Chicago case two years later that the Supreme Court incorporated the Second Amendment into state law. Another area in which the Supreme Court gradually moved to incorporate the Bill of Rights regards censorship and the Fourteenth Amendment. In Near v. Minnesota (1931), the Court disagreed with state courts regarding censorship and ruled it unconstitutional except in rare cases.

选择性纳入是一个持续的过程。**2008 年，最高法院最初裁定第二修正案, 保护个人持有和携带武器的权利，但当时并未裁定这是一项各州必须维护的基本自由。**直到两年后的 “麦克唐纳诉芝加哥案”（McDonald v. Chicago） 中，最高法院才将第二修正案纳入州法律。最高法院逐步将"权利法案"纳入"州法律"的另一个领域, 是审查制度和第十四修正案。在“尼尔诉明尼苏达州案” （Near v. Minnesota ，1931 年）中，"最高法院"与"州法院"在审查制度问题上意见相左，最高法院裁定"除极少数例外情况外，审查制度是违宪的"。
