== 释义



The collection of public opinion through polling and interviews is a part of American political culture. Politicians want to know what the public thinks. Campaign managers want to know how citizens will vote. Media members seek to write stories about what Americans want. Every day, polls take the pulse of the people and report the results. And yet we have to wonder: Why do we care what people think?
通过民意调查和访谈收集公众意见是美国政治文化的一部分。政客们想知道公众的想法。竞选经理们想知道选民会如何投票。媒体成员则力求报道美国民众的需求。每天，民意调查都在了解民众的意愿并公布结果。然而，我们不禁要问：我们为什么要关心人们的想法？

WHAT IS PUBLIC OPINION?
什么是公众舆论？
Public opinion is a collection of popular views about something, perhaps a person, a local or national event, or a new idea. For example, each day, a number of polling companies call Americans at random to ask whether they approve or disapprove of the way the president is guiding the economy.4 When situations arise internationally, polling companies survey whether citizens support U.S. intervention in places like Syria or Ukraine. These individual opinions are collected together to be analyzed and interpreted for politicians and the media. The analysis examines how the public feels or thinks, so politicians can use the information to make decisions about their future legislative votes, campaign messages, or propaganda.

民意是指公众对某事（例如某人、地方或国家事件、或新理念）的普遍看法。例如，每天都有许多民调公司随机致电美国民众，询问他们是否赞成总统的经济政策。当国际局势发生变化时，民调公司会调查公民是否支持美国干预叙利亚或乌克兰等地。这些个人意见会被汇总起来，供政客和媒体分析解读。分析旨在了解公众的感受和想法， 以便政客能够利用这些信息来制定未来的立法投票、竞选策略或宣传策略。

But where do people’s opinions come from? Most citizens base their political opinions on their beliefs5 and their attitudes, both of which begin to form in childhood. Beliefs are closely held ideas that support our values and expectations about life and politics. For example, the idea that we are all entitled to equality, liberty, freedom, and privacy is a belief most people in the United States share. We may acquire this belief by growing up in the United States or by having come from a country that did not afford these valued principles to its citizens.

[.my2]
但人们的观点从何而来？大多数公民的政治观点都基于他们的信仰和态度， 而这两者都始于童年时期。 信仰是根深蒂固的观念，支撑着我们对生活和政治的价值观和期望。例如，我们每个人都享有平等、自由、权利和隐私，这是大多数美国人所认同的信念。我们可能因为在美国长大而形成这种信念，也可能因为我们来自一个不保障公民这些宝贵原则的国家而形成这种信念。

Our attitudes are also affected by our personal beliefs and represent the preferences we form based on our life experiences and values. A person who has suffered racism or bigotry may have a skeptical attitude toward the actions of authority figures, for example.

[.my2]
我们的态度也受到个人信仰的影响，代表着我们基于生活经历和价值观形成的偏好。例如，遭受过种族歧视或偏见的人可能会对权威人士的行为持怀疑态度。

Over time, our beliefs and our attitudes about people, events, and ideas will become a set of norms, or accepted ideas, about what we may feel should happen in our society or what is right for the government to do in a situation. In this way, attitudes and beliefs form the foundation for opinions.

[.my2]
随着时间的推移，我们对人、事、物的信念和态度会逐渐形成一套规范，或者说一套被普遍接受的观念，这些观念关乎我们认为社会应该发生什么，或者政府在特定情况下应该采取什么行动。如此一来，态度和信念便构成了观点的基础。

POLITICAL SOCIALIZATION  政治社会化
At the same time that our beliefs and attitudes are forming during childhood, we are also being socialized; that is, we are learning from many information sources about the society and community in which we live and how we are to behave in it. Political socialization is the process by which we are trained to understand and join a country’s political world, and, like most forms of socialization, it starts when we are very young. We may first become aware of politics by watching a parent or guardian vote, for instance, or by hearing presidents and candidates speak on television or the Internet, or seeing adults honor the American flag at an event (Figure 6.2). As socialization continues, we are introduced to basic political information in school. We recite the Pledge of Allegiance and learn about the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, the two major political parties, the three branches of government, and the economic system.

[.my2]
在我们童年时期形成信仰和态度的同时，我们也在经历社会化过程 ；也就是说，我们从各种信息来源了解我们所生活的社会和社区，以及我们应该如何在其中行事。 政治社会化是指我们接受训练以理解并融入一个国家的政治体系的过程，而且，像大多数社会化形式一样，它始于我们很小的时候。例如，我们可能通过观看父母或监护人投票，或者通过电视或互联网上听到总统和候选人的讲话，或者看到成年人在某个活动中向美国国旗致敬（ 图 6.2 ）而首次意识到政治的存在。随着社会化的进行，我们在学校里会接触到基本的政治信息。我们会背诵效忠誓词，学习开国元勋、宪法、两大政党、政府的三大分支以及经济体系。

By the time we complete school, we have usually acquired the information necessary to form political views and be contributing members of the political system. A young man may realize he prefers the Democratic Party because it supports his views on social programs and education, whereas a young woman may decide she wants to vote for the Republican Party because its platform echoes her beliefs about economic growth and family values.

[.my2]
通常情况下，我们在完成学业时已经掌握了形成政治观点并成为政治体系中积极成员所需的信息。一位年轻男性可能会意识到自己更倾向于民主党，因为民主党支持他在社会福利和教育方面的观点；而一位年轻女性则可能决定投票给共和党，因为共和党的纲领与她关于经济增长和家庭价值观的信念不谋而合。

Accounting for the process of socialization is central to our understanding of public opinion, because the beliefs we acquire early in life are unlikely to change dramatically as we grow older.6 Our political ideology, made up of the attitudes and beliefs that help shape our opinions on political theory and policy, is rooted in who we are as individuals. Our ideology may change subtly as we grow older and are introduced to new circumstances or new information, but our underlying beliefs and attitudes are unlikely to change very much, unless we experience events that profoundly affect us. For example, family members of 9/11 victims became more Republican and more political following the terrorist attacks.7 Similarly, young adults who attended political protest rallies in the 1960s and 1970s were more likely to participate in politics in general than their peers who had not protested.8
理解社会化过程对于我们理解公众舆论至关重要，因为我们早年形成的信念不太可能随着年龄增长而发生显著改变。 6 我们的政治意识形态，由塑造我们对政治理论和政策观点的态度和信念构成，根植于我们作为个体的身份认同。随着年龄增长，我们接触到新的环境或信息，我们的意识形态可能会发生微妙的变化，但除非经历深刻影响我们的事件，否则我们潜在的信念和态度不太可能发生太大改变。例如，9/11 事件后，遇难者家属变得更加倾向于共和党，也更加关注政治。 7 同样，在 20 世纪 60 年代和 70 年代参加过政治抗议集会的年轻人，比没有参加过抗议活动的同龄人更有可能参与政治活动。 8

If enough beliefs or attitudes are shattered by an event, such as an economic catastrophe or a threat to personal safety, ideology shifts may affect the way we vote. During the 1920s, the Republican Party controlled the House of Representatives and the Senate, sometimes by wide margins.9 After the stock market collapsed and the nation slid into the Great Depression, many citizens abandoned the Republican Party. In 1932, voters overwhelmingly chose Democratic candidates, for both the presidency and Congress. The Democratic Party gained registered members and the Republican Party lost them.10 Citizens’ beliefs had shifted enough to cause the control of Congress to change from one party to the other, and Democrats continued to hold Congress for several decades. Another sea change occurred in Congress in the 1994 elections when the Republican Party took control of both the House and the Senate for the first time in over forty years.

[.my2]
如果经济灾难或人身安全受到威胁等事件彻底颠覆了人们的信仰或态度，意识形态的转变可能会影响我们的投票方式。20 世纪 20 年代，共和党控制着众议院和参议院，有时甚至以较大优势获胜。9 股市崩盘后，国家陷入大萧条，许多公民放弃了共和党。1932 年，选民在总统和国会选举中都压倒性地选择了民主党候选人。民主党的注册党员人数增加，而共和党则减少了注册党员。10 公民的信仰发生了足够的转变，导致国会的控制权从一个政党转移到另一个政党，民主党在接下来的几十年里继续掌控着国会。1994 年的选举再次改变了国会格局，共和党四十多年来首次同时控制了众议院和参议院。

Today, polling agencies have noticed that citizens’ beliefs have become far more polarized, or widely opposed, over the last decade.11 To track this polarization, Pew Research conducted a study of Republican and Democratic respondents over a twenty-five-year span. Every few years, Pew would poll respondents, asking them whether they agreed or disagreed with statements. These statements are referred to as “value questions” or “value statements,” because they measure what the respondent values. Examples of statements include “Government regulation of business usually does more harm than good,” “Labor unions are necessary to protect the working person,” and “Society should ensure all have equal opportunity to succeed.” After comparing such answers for twenty-five years, Pew Research found that Republican and Democratic respondents are increasingly answering these questions very differently. This is especially true for questions about the government and politics. In 1987, 58 percent of Democrats and 60 percent of Republicans agreed with the statement that the government controlled too much of our daily lives. In 2012, 47 percent of Democrats and 77 percent of Republicans agreed with the statement. This is an example of polarization, in which members of one party see government from a very different perspective than the members of the other party (Figure 6.3).12 The gap between the parties on the role of government has grown further since 2012. While the 2012 gap was 30 percent, a 2019 Pew study put that number at 35 percent.13
如今，民调机构注意到，过去十年间，公民的信念变得更加两极分化，或者说对立现象日益严重。 11 为了追踪这种两极分化趋势 ，皮尤研究中心对共和党和民主党受访者进行了长达 25 年的研究。每隔几年，皮尤研究中心都会对受访者进行民意调查，询问他们是否同意某些陈述。这些陈述被称为“价值判断题”或“价值陈述”，因为它们衡量的是受访者的价值观。例如，“政府对企业的监管通常弊大于利”、“工会对于保护劳动者至关重要”以及“社会应该确保人人享有平等的成功机会”。经过 25 年的比较，皮尤研究中心发现，共和党和民主党受访者对这些问题的回答越来越不一致。尤其是在涉及政府和政治的问题上，这种差异更为显著。1987 年，58%的民主党人和 60%的共和党人同意“政府过度干预我们的日常生活”这一说法。 2012 年，47%的民主党人和 77%的共和党人同意这一说法。这是一个极化现象的例子，即一个政党的成员对政府的看法与另一个政党的成员截然不同（ 图 6.3 ）。 12 自 2012 年以来，两党在政府角色问题上的分歧进一步扩大。2012 年的差距为 30%，而皮尤研究中心 2019 年的一项研究显示，这一数字已达到 35%。 13

Chart shows the widening partisan differences in political values between 1987 and 2012. In the center of the chart is a vertical axis line. On the right side of the line are the years 1987 through 2012 marked with ticks. On the left side of the line are percentages, labeled “the percentage-point differences between Republicans and Democrats on questions about values”. The percentages are as follows: 10% in 1987, 9% in 1988, 10% in 1990, 11% in 1994, 9% in 1997, 11% in 1999, 11% in 2002, 14% in 2003, 14% in 2007, 16% in 2009, and 18% in 2012. At the bottom of the chart, a source is cited: “Pew research center, “2012 values survey.” April 2012”.

[.my2]
Figure 6.3 Over the years, Democrats and Republicans have moved further apart in their beliefs about the role of government. In 1987, Republican and Democratic answers to forty-eight values questions differed by an average of only 10 percent, but that difference has grown to 18 percent over the last twenty-five years. A similar study conducted by Pew in 2019, using thirty values questions, shows that gap has increased to 39 percent.

[.my2]
图 6.3 多年来，民主党人和共和党人在政府角色问题上的信念分歧日益加深。1987 年，共和党人和民主党人对 48 个价值观问题的回答平均相差 10%，但过去 25 年间，这一差距已扩大至 18%。皮尤研究中心 2019 年进行的一项类似研究，使用了 30 个价值观问题，结果显示这一差距已扩大至 39%。
Political scientists noted this and other changes in beliefs following the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States, including an increase in the level of trust in government14 and a new willingness to limit liberties for groups or citizens who “[did] not fit into the dominant cultural type.”15 According to some scholars, these shifts led partisanship to become more polarized than in previous decades, as more citizens began thinking of themselves as conservative or liberal rather than moderate.16 Some believe 9/11 caused a number of citizens to become more conservative overall, although it is hard to judge whether such a shift will be permanent.17
政治学家注意到，在 9/11 恐怖袭击事件发生后，美国民众的信念发生了上述及其他变化，包括对政府信任度的提升 14 ，以及限制“不符合主流文化类型”的群体或公民自由的意愿增强 15 。一些学者认为，这些转变导致党派之争比过去几十年更加两极分化，因为越来越多的公民开始认为自己是保守派或自由派，而非温和派 16 。一些人认为，9/11 事件导致部分公民的整体立场更加保守，但这种转变是否会持续下去尚难判断 17 。

SOCIALIZATION AGENTS  社会化主体
An agent of political socialization is a source of political information intended to help citizens understand how to act in their political system and how to make decisions on political matters. The information may help a citizen decide how to vote, where to donate money, or how to protest decisions made by the government.

[.my2]
政治社会化媒介是政治信息的来源，旨在帮助公民了解如何在政治体系中行动以及如何就政治事务做出决策。这些信息可以帮助公民决定如何投票、向哪里捐款，或者如何抗议政府的决定。

The most prominent agents of socialization are family and school. Other influential agents are social groups, such as religious institutions and friends, and the media. Political socialization is not unique to the United States. Many nations have realized the benefits of socializing their populations. China, for example, stresses nationalism in schools as a way to increase national unity.18 In the United States, one benefit of socialization is that our political system enjoys diffuse support, which is support characterized by a high level of stability in politics, acceptance of the government as legitimate, and a common goal of preserving the system.19 These traits keep a country steady, even during times of political or social upheaval. But diffuse support does not happen quickly, nor does it occur without the help of agents of political socialization.

[.my2]
社会化最主要的媒介是家庭和学校。其他有影响力的媒介包括社会群体，例如宗教机构和朋友，以及媒体。政治社会化并非美国独有。许多国家都认识到对民众进行社会化的益处。例如，中国在学校强调民族主义，以此来增强国家团结。 18 在美国，社会化的一项益处是，我们的政治体系享有广泛的支持 ，这种支持的特点是政治高度稳定、政府合法性得到认可，以及维护体制的共同目标。 19 这些特征使一个国家保持稳定，即使在政治或社会动荡时期也是如此。但广泛的支持并非一蹴而就，也离不开政治社会化媒介的帮助。

For many children, family is the first introduction to politics. Children may hear adult conversations at home and piece together the political messages their parents support. They often know how their parents or grandparents plan to vote, which in turn can socialize them into political behavior such as political party membership.20 Children who accompany their parents on Election Day in November are exposed to the act of voting and the concept of civic duty, which is the performance of actions that benefit the country or community. Families active in community projects or politics make children aware of community needs and politics.

[.my2]
对许多孩子来说，家庭是他们接触政治的最初途径。孩子们在家中可能会听到大人的谈话，并逐渐了解父母支持的政治观点。他们通常知道父母或祖父母的投票意向，这反过来又会潜移默化地影响他们的政治行为，例如加入某个政党。20 在 11 月的选举日，如果孩子们陪同父母去投票，他们就能接触到投票行为和公民义务的概念，即履行有利于国家或社区的行动。积极参与社区项目或政治活动的家庭，能够让孩子们了解社区的需求和政治。

Introducing children to these activities has an impact on their future behavior. Both early and recent findings suggest that children adopt some of the political beliefs and attitudes of their parents (Figure 6.4).21 Children of Democratic parents often become registered Democrats, whereas children in Republican households often become Republicans. Children living in households where parents do not display a consistent political party loyalty are less likely to be strong Democrats or strong Republicans, and instead are often independents.22
让儿童参与这些活动会对其未来的行为产生影响。早期和近期的研究均表明，儿童会采纳父母的一些政治信仰和态度（ 图 6.4 ）。 21 民主党家庭的孩子往往会成为注册的民主党人，而共和党家庭的孩子往往会成为共和党人。在父母没有表现出稳定政党忠诚度的家庭中，儿童不太可能成为坚定的民主党人或共和党人，而往往是独立人士。 22

Chart shows the percentage intergenerational resemblance in partisan orientation in 1992. People who identify as strong democrat reported their parents’ political orientation as follows: 31% reported both of their parents as democrats, 6% reported both of their parents as republicans, and 10% reported no consistent partisanship among parents. Weak democrats reported their parents’ political orientation as follows: 27% reported both parents as democrat, 6% reported both their parents as republicans, and 14% reported no consistent partisanship among parents. Independent democrats reported their parents’ political orientation as follows: 14% reported both parents as democrats, 6% reported both parents as republicans, and 18% reported no consistent partisanship among parents. Pure independents reported their parents’ political orientation as follows: 7% reported both parents as democrats. 7% reported both parents as republicans. 17% reported no consistent partisanship among parents. Independent republicans reported their parents’ political orientation as follows: 7% reported both parents as democrats, 16% reported both parents as republicans. 16% reported no consistent partisanship among parents. Weak republicans reported their parents’ political orientation as follows: 8% reported both parents as democrats, 32% reported both parents as republicans, 14% reported no consistent partisanship among parents. Strong republicans reported their parents’ political orientation as follows: 6% reported both parents as democrats, 27% report both parents as republicans, and 9% reported no consistent partisanship among parents. At the bottom of the chart, a source is cited: “Miller, Warren E., Donald R. Kinder, Steven J. Rosenstone, and National Election Studies.

Figure 6.4 A parent’s political orientation often affects the political orientation of their child. Note in the first two data sets (children whose parents share the same party affiliation) the crystallization of ideology with that of the parents. Meanwhile, when their parents are not affiliated with the same political party, a child's ideology is less homogeneous.

[.my2]
图 6.4 父母的政治倾向通常会影响子女的政治倾向。请注意前两组数据（父母党派相同的子女），子女的意识形态与父母的意识形态高度一致。而当父母党派不同时，子女的意识形态则较为分散。
While family provides an informal political education, schools offer a more formal and increasingly important one. The early introduction is often broad and thematic, covering explorers, presidents, victories, and symbols, but generally the lessons are idealized and do not discuss many of the specific problems or controversies connected with historical figures and moments. George Washington’s contributions as our first president are highlighted, for instance, but teachers are unlikely to mention that he enslaved people. In fact, a 2018 report from the Southern Poverty Law Center shows evidence of a continued lack of coverage of slavery, difficulty in teaching it, and a too superficial treatment of the topic in textbooks.23 Lessons will also try to personalize government and make leaders relatable to children. A teacher might discuss Abraham Lincoln’s childhood struggle to get an education despite the death of his mother and his family’s poverty. Children learn to respect government, follow laws, and obey the requests of police, firefighters, and other first responders. The Pledge of Allegiance becomes a regular part of the school day, as students learn to show respect to our country’s symbols such as the flag and to abstractions such as liberty and equality.

[.my2]
家庭提供非正式的政治教育，而学校则提供更为正式且日益重要的政治教育。早期的政治启蒙通常涵盖广泛且主题鲜明的内容，包括探险家、总统、胜利和象征意义，但这些课程通常过于理想化，很少讨论与历史人物和事件相关的具体问题或争议。例如，乔治· 华盛顿作为美国首任总统的贡献会被着重强调，但教师不太可能提及他曾奴役他人。事实上，南方贫困法律中心 2018 年的一份报告显示，教科书中对奴隶制的描述仍然不足，教学难度大，且对该主题的处理过于肤浅。 《23 堂课》也将尝试使政府更具个人色彩，让孩子们更容易与领导人产生共鸣。教师可能会讲述亚伯拉罕 ·林肯在母亲去世和家庭贫困的情况下，如何克服童年困难接受教育的故事。孩子们将学会尊重政府、遵守法律，并服从警察、消防员和其他应急人员的指示。宣誓效忠成为学校日常生活的一部分，学生们从中学会尊重我们国家的象征，例如国旗，以及自由和平等等抽象概念。

As students progress to higher grades, lessons will cover more detailed information about the history of the United States, its economic system, and the workings of the government. Complex topics such as the legislative process, checks and balances, and domestic policymaking are covered. Introductory economics classes teach about the various ways to build an economy, explaining how the capitalist system works. Many high schools have implemented civic volunteerism requirements as a way to encourage students to participate in their communities. Many offer Advanced Placement classes in U.S. government and history, or other honors-level courses, such as International Baccalaureate or dual-credit courses. These courses can introduce detail and realism, raise controversial topics, and encourage students to make comparisons and think critically about the United States in a global and historical context. College students may choose to pursue their academic study of the U.S. political system further, become active in campus advocacy or rights groups, or run for any of a number of elected positions on campus or even in the local community. Each step of the educational system’s socialization process will ready students to make decisions and be participating members of political society.

[.my2]
随着学生年级的升高，课程将涵盖更多关于美国历史、经济体系和政府运作的详细信息。课程内容包括立法程序、权力制衡和国内政策制定等复杂议题。经济学入门课程会讲解构建经济的各种方式，并阐释资本主义体系的运作原理。许多高中都设有公民志愿服务要求，以此鼓励学生参与社区活动。许多学校开设美国政府和历史的大学先修课程（AP 课程），或其他荣誉课程，例如国际文凭课程（IB）或双学分课程。这些课程能够提供更详尽、更贴近现实的内容，引发争议性话题，并鼓励学生在全球和历史背景下对美国进行比较和批判性思考。大学生可以选择继续深入研究美国政治体系，积极参与校园倡导或维权组织，或者竞选校园乃至社区的各种公职。教育体系社会化进程中的每一步都将帮助学生做好准备，以便他们能够做出决策并成为政治社会的积极成员。

We are also socialized outside our homes and schools. When citizens attend religious ceremonies, as 64 percent of Americans in a recent survey claimed,24 they are socialized to adopt beliefs that affect their politics. Religion leaders often teach on matters of life, death, punishment, and obligation, which translate into views on political issues such as abortion, euthanasia, social services, the death penalty, and military involvement abroad. Political candidates speak at religious centers and institutions in an effort to meet like-minded voters. For example, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) announced his 2016 presidential bid at Liberty University, an evangelical Christian institution. This university matched Cruz’s conservative and religious ideological leanings and was intended to give him a boost from the conservative evangelical community.

[.my2]
我们除了家庭和学校之外，还会受到社会化的影响。正如最近一项调查中 64 %的美国人所言，当公民参加宗教仪式时，他们会受到社会化的影响，从而接受影响其政治观点的信仰。宗教领袖经常就生命、死亡、惩罚和义务等问题进行布道，这些内容会转化为人们对堕胎、安乐死、社会服务、死刑和海外军事行动等政治议题的看法。政治候选人也会在宗教中心和机构发表演讲，以争取志同道合的选民。例如，德克萨斯州共和党参议员特德· 克鲁兹 (Ted Cruz)在福音派基督教大学——自由大学(Liberty University)宣布了他 2016 年的总统竞选。这所大学与克鲁兹的保守主义和宗教意识形态倾向相符，旨在帮助他获得保守福音派社区的支持。

Friends and peers too have a socializing effect on citizens. Communication networks are based on trust and common interests, so when we receive information from friends and neighbors, we often readily accept it because we trust them.25 Information transmitted through social media like Facebook is also likely to have a socializing effect. Friends “like” articles and information, sharing their political beliefs and information with one another. However, because of the self-selection of friends, social media outlets have the potential to introduce bias. If the social media platform does not properly police what is factual in posts and advertisements, then these outlets can become objects of manipulation, as in the 2016 election.26
朋友和同伴也会对公民产生社会化影响。沟通网络建立在信任和共同利益之上，因此，当我们从朋友和邻居那里获得信息时，我们往往会欣然接受，因为我们信任他们。 25 通过 Facebook 等社交媒体传播的信息也可能产生社会化影响。朋友们会“点赞”文章和信息，彼此分享他们的政治观点和信息。然而，由于朋友是自我选择的，社交媒体平台有可能引入偏见。如果社交媒体平台不能有效监管帖子和广告中的真实性，那么这些平台就可能成为操纵的对象，就像 2016 年大选那样。 26

Media—newspapers, television, radio, and the Internet—also socialize citizens through the information they provide. For a long time, the media served as gatekeepers of our information, creating reality by choosing what to present. If the media did not cover an issue or event, it was as if it did not exist. With the rise of the Internet and social media, however, traditional media have become less powerful agents of this kind of socialization.

[.my2]
媒体——包括报纸、电视、广播和互联网——通过其提供的信息对公民进行社会化。长期以来，媒体扮演着信息把关人的角色，通过选择呈现的内容来塑造现实。如果媒体没有报道某个问题或事件，就好像它不存在一样。然而，随着互联网和社交媒体的兴起，传统媒体在这种社会化过程中发挥的作用已逐渐减弱。

Another way the media socializes audiences is through framing, or choosing the way information is presented. Framing can affect the way an event or story is perceived. Candidates described with negative adjectives, for instance, may do poorly on Election Day. Consider the recent demonstrations over the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and of Freddie Gray in Baltimore, Maryland. Both deaths were caused by police actions against unarmed African American men. Brown was shot to death by an officer on August 9, 2014. Gray died from spinal injuries sustained in transport to jail in April 2015. Following each death, family, friends, and sympathizers protested the police actions as excessive and unfair. While some television stations framed the demonstrations as riots and looting, other stations framed them as protests and fights against corruption. The demonstrations contained both riot and protest, but individuals’ perceptions were affected by the framing chosen by their preferred information sources (Figure 6.5).27
媒体影响受众的另一种方式是通过框架效应 ，即选择信息的呈现方式。框架效应会影响人们对事件或故事的感知。例如，用负面形容词描述的候选人在选举日可能表现不佳。以近期发生在密苏里州弗格森市迈克尔· 布朗和马里兰州巴尔的摩市弗雷迪· 格雷之死引发的示威活动为例。这两起死亡事件均由警察对非裔美国男子的暴力执法造成。布朗于 2014 年 8 月 9 日被一名警察枪杀。格雷于 2015 年 4 月在押送监狱途中因脊柱受伤而死亡。每次死亡事件发生后，死者的家人、朋友和同情者都抗议警方过度执法和不公正行为。一些电视台将示威活动描述为骚乱和抢劫，而另一些电视台则将其描述为抗议和反腐败斗争。示威活动既包含骚乱也包含抗议，但个人的感知受到其偏好信息来源所选择的框架效应的影响（ 图 6.5 ）。 27

Finally, media information presented as fact can contain covert or overt political material. Covert content is political information provided under the pretense that it is neutral. A magazine might run a story on climate change by interviewing representatives of only one side of the policy debate and downplaying the opposing view, all without acknowledging the one-sided nature of its coverage. In contrast, when the writer or publication makes clear to the reader or viewer that the information offers only one side of the political debate, the political message is overt content. Political commentators like Rush Limbaugh and publications like Mother Jones openly state their ideological viewpoints. While such overt political content may be offensive or annoying to a reader or viewer, all are offered the choice whether to be exposed to the material.

最后，以事实形式呈现的媒体信息可能包含隐性或显性的政治内容。 隐性内容是指以中立姿态呈现的政治信息。例如，某杂志可能在报道气候变化时，只采访政策辩论中某一方的代表，淡化对立观点，却不承认其报道的片面性。相反，当作者或出版物明确告知读者或观众，信息仅呈现政治辩论的一方观点时，其政治信息就属于显性内容 。像拉什·林博这样的政治评论员以及 《琼斯母亲》 杂志等出版物都会公开表达他们的意识形态观点。虽然这种显性政治内容可能会冒犯或惹恼读者或观众，但每个人都可以选择是否接触这些信息。

SOCIALIZATION AND IDEOLOGY
社会化与意识形态
The socialization process leaves citizens with attitudes and beliefs that create a personal ideology. Ideologies depend on attitudes and beliefs, and on the way we prioritize each belief over the others. Most citizens hold a great number of beliefs and attitudes about government action. Many think government should provide for the common defense, in the form of a national military. They also argue that government should provide services to its citizens in the form of free education, unemployment benefits, and assistance for the poor.

[.my2]
社会化过程使公民形成态度和信念，进而形成个人意识形态。意识形态取决于态度和信念，以及我们如何权衡各种信念。大多数公民对政府行为持有多种信念和态度。许多人认为政府应该以国家军队的形式提供共同防御。他们还认为政府应该以免费教育、失业救济金和扶贫等形式为公民提供服务。

When asked how to divide the national budget, Americans reveal priorities that divide public opinion. Should we have a smaller military and larger social benefits, or a larger military budget and limited social benefits? This is the guns versus butter debate, which assumes that governments have a finite amount of money and must choose whether to spend a larger part on the military or on social programs. The choice forces citizens into two opposing groups.

[.my2]
当被问及如何分配国家预算时，美国民众展现出的优先事项往往引发了公众舆论的分歧。我们应该减少军费开支，增加社会福利支出，还是增加军费开支，限制社会福利支出？这就是所谓的 “枪炮与黄油”之争，它假定政府的资金有限，必须在军费开支和社会福利支出之间做出选择。这种选择迫使公民分成两个对立的阵营。

Divisions like these appear throughout public opinion. Assume we have four different people named Garcia, Chin, Smith, and Dupree. Garcia may believe that the United States should provide a free education for every citizen all the way through college, whereas Chin may believe education should be free only through high school. Smith might believe children should be covered by health insurance at the government’s expense, whereas Dupree believes all citizens should be covered. In the end, the way we prioritize our beliefs and what we decide is most important to us determines whether we are on the liberal or conservative end of the political spectrum, or somewhere in between.

[.my2]
诸如此类的分歧在公众舆论中屡见不鲜。假设我们有四个人，分别叫加西亚、秦、史密斯和杜普雷。加西亚可能认为美国应该为所有公民提供从小学到大学的免费教育，而秦则可能认为免费教育只应持续到高中。史密斯可能认为儿童应该享有政府提供的医疗保险，而杜普雷则认为所有公民都应该享有医疗保险。最终，我们如何权衡自己的信念以及我们认为什么对我们最重要，决定了我们是处于政治光谱的自由派、保守派，还是介于两者之间。

IDEOLOGIES AND THE IDEOLOGICAL SPECTRUM
意识形态及其光谱
One useful way to look at ideologies is to place them on a spectrum that visually compares them based on what they prioritize. Liberal ideologies are traditionally put on the left and conservative ideologies on the right. (This placement dates from the French Revolution and is why liberals are called left-wing and conservatives are called right-wing.) The ideologies at the ends of the spectrum are the most extreme; those in the middle are moderate. Thus, people who identify with left- and right-wing ideologies identify with beliefs to the left and right ends of the spectrum, while moderates balance the beliefs at the extremes of the spectrum.

[.my2]
看待意识形态的一个有效方法是将其置于一个光谱上，根据其优先顺序进行直观比较。传统上，自由主义意识形态被置于左侧，保守主义意识形态被置于右侧。（这种划分源于法国大革命，这也是自由主义者被称为左翼，保守主义者被称为右翼的原因。）光谱两端的意识形态最为极端；中间的意识形态则较为温和。因此，认同左翼和右翼意识形态的人分别认同光谱两端的观点，而温和派则在光谱两端的观点之间寻求平衡。

In the United States, ideologies at the right side of the spectrum prioritize government control over personal freedoms. They range from fascism to authoritarianism to conservatism. Ideologies on the left side of the spectrum prioritize equality and range from communism to socialism to liberalism (Figure 6.6). Moderate ideologies fall in the middle and try to balance the two extremes. When thinking about ideology and politics, it is important not to fall into thinking that involves false dichotomies. One such false dichotomy involves socialism versus capitalism. The two terms have been conflated into partisan categories that connote either collectivism or individualism. Political systems, including the U.S., can possess aspects of both socialism and capitalism.28
在美国，右翼意识形态优先考虑政府控制而非个人自由，其范围涵盖法西斯主义、威权主义和保守主义。左翼意识形态则优先考虑平等，其范围涵盖共产主义、社会主义和自由主义（ 图 6.6 ）。温和的意识形态则介于两者之间，试图在两个极端之间寻求平衡。在思考意识形态和政治时，重要的是避免陷入非此即彼的错误思维。社会主义与资本主义就是一种常见的非此即彼的错误思维。这两个术语常常被混淆，分别代表集体主义或个人主义，并被赋予了党派色彩。事实上，包括美国在内的许多政治制度都可能同时具有社会主义和资本主义的特征。 28

A political spectrum shows the political stance from the left wing to the right wing. Starting in the left wing, which is labeled “equality in society,” the spectrum moves right from “communism” to “socialism” to “liberal.” The middle of the spectrum is labeled “center.” Moving toward the right wing, it starts at “conservative” to “authoritarianism” to “fascism.” The right wing is labeled “control of society.”
Figure 6.6 People who espouse left-wing ideologies in the United States identify with beliefs on the left side of the spectrum that prioritize equality, whereas those on the right side of the spectrum emphasize control.

[.my2]
图 6.6 在美国，信奉左翼意识形态的人认同光谱左侧的信念，即优先考虑平等，而光谱右侧的信念则强调控制。
Fascism promotes total control of the country by the ruling party or political leader. This form of government will run the economy, the military, society, and culture, and often tries to control the private lives of its citizens. Authoritarian leaders control the politics, military, and government of a country, and often the economy as well.

[.my2]
法西斯主义主张执政党或政治领袖对国家实行全面控制。这种政体掌控经济、军事、社会和文化，并常常试图控制公民的私生活。独裁领导人控制着一个国家的政治、军事和政府，通常也控制着经济。

Conservative governments attempt to hold tight to the traditions of a nation by balancing individual rights with the good of the community. Traditional conservatism supports the authority of the monarchy and the church, believing government provides the rule of law and maintains a society that is safe and organized. Modern conservatism differs from traditional conservatism in assuming elected government will guard individual liberties and provide laws. Modern conservatives also prefer a smaller government that stays out of the economy, allowing the market and business to determine prices, wages, and supply.

[.my2]
保守主义政府力图通过平衡个人权利与社会利益来维护国家传统。 传统保守主义支持君主制和教会的权威，认为政府负责维护法治，保障社会安全有序。 现代保守主义与传统保守主义的不同之处在于，它假定民选政府能够保障个人自由并制定法律。现代保守主义者也倾向于小政府，让政府不干预经济，从而使市场和企业能够决定价格、工资和供给。

Classical liberalism believes in individual liberties and rights. It is based on the idea of free will, that people are born equal with the right to make decisions without government intervention. It views government with suspicion, since history includes many examples of monarchs and leaders who limited citizens’ rights. Today, modern liberalism focuses on equality and supports government intervention in society and the economy if it promotes equality. Liberals expect government to provide basic social and educational programs to help everyone have a chance to succeed.

[.my2]
古典自由主义信奉个人自由和权利。它基于自由意志的理念，认为人人生而平等，有权在不受政府干预的情况下做出决定。古典自由主义对政府持怀疑态度，因为历史上有很多君主和统治者限制公民权利的例子。如今， 现代自由主义强调平等，并支持政府在促进平等的前提下对社会和经济进行干预。自由主义者期望政府提供基本的社会和教育项目，帮助每个人都有机会获得成功。

Under socialism, the government uses its authority to promote social and economic equality within the country. Socialists believe government should provide everyone with expanded services and public programs, such as health care, subsidized housing and groceries, childhood education, and inexpensive college tuition. Socialism sees the government as a way to ensure all citizens receive both equal opportunities and equal outcomes. Citizens with more wealth are expected to contribute more to the state’s revenue through higher taxes that pay for services provided to all. Socialist countries are also likely to have higher minimum wages than non-socialist countries.

[.my2]
在社会主义制度下，政府运用其权力促进国内的社会和经济平等。社会主义者认为，政府应该为所有人提供更广泛的公共服务和项目，例如医疗保健、补贴住房和食品、儿童早期教育以及低廉的大学学费。社会主义将政府视为确保所有公民享有平等机会和平等结果的途径。富裕公民需要通过缴纳更高的税款为国家财政收入做出更多贡献，这些税收用于支付面向所有人的公共服务。社会主义国家的最低工资标准通常也高于非社会主义国家。

In theory, communism promotes common ownership of all property, means of production, and materials. This means that the government, or states, should own the property, farms, manufacturing, and businesses. By controlling these aspects of the economy, Communist governments can prevent the exploitation of workers while creating an equal society. Extreme inequality of income, in which some citizens earn millions of dollars a year and other citizens merely hundreds, is prevented by instituting wage controls or by abandoning currency altogether. Communism presents a problem, however, because the practice differs from the theory. The theory assumes the move to communism is supported and led by the proletariat, or the workers and citizens of a country.29 Human rights violations by governments of actual Communist countries make it appear the movement has been driven not by the people, but by leadership.

[.my2]
理论上， 共产主义提倡所有财产、生产资料和原材料的公有制。这意味着政府或国家应该拥有财产、农场、制造业和企业。通过控制经济的这些方面，共产主义政府可以防止剥削工人，同时建立一个平等的社会。通过实行工资管制或彻底废除货币，可以防止收入极度不平等，即一些公民年收入数百万美元，而另一些公民年收入仅有数百美元。然而，共产主义存在一个问题，那就是实践与理论不符。理论假设向共产主义的过渡是由无产阶级，即一个国家的工人和公民，支持和领导的。 然而， 一些共产主义国家的政府侵犯人权的行为表明，这场运动似乎并非由人民推动，而是由领导层推动的。

We can characterize economic variations on these ideologies by adding another dimension to the ideological spectrum above—whether we prefer that government control the state economy or stay out of it. The extremes are a command economy, such as existed in the former Soviet Russia, and a laissez-faire (“leave it alone”) economy, such as in the United States prior to the 1929 market crash, when banks and corporations were largely unregulated. Communism prioritizes control of both politics and economy, while libertarianism is its near-opposite. Libertarians believe in individual rights and limited government intervention in private life and personal economic decisions. Government exists to maintain freedom and life, so its main function is to ensure domestic peace and national defense. Libertarians also believe the national government should maintain a military in case of international threats, but that it should not engage in setting minimum wages or ruling in private matters, like same-sex marriage or the right to abortion.30
我们可以通过在上述意识形态光谱中加入另一个维度来描述这些意识形态下的经济变体——即我们倾向于政府控制国家经济还是完全放任不管。极端情况分别是指令型经济（例如前苏联）和自由放任（“不干预”）经济（例如 1929 年股市崩盘前的美国，当时银行和企业基本上不受监管）。共产主义优先考虑对政治和经济的控制，而自由主义则几乎与之相反。 自由主义者相信个人权利，并认为政府不应过多干预私人生活和个人经济决策。政府存在的目的是维护自由和生命，因此其主要职能是确保国内和平与国防。自由主义者还认为，国家政府应在国际威胁出现时维持军队，但不应干预最低工资或同性婚姻、堕胎权等私人事务 。30

The point where a person’s ideology falls on the spectrum gives us some insight to that person's opinions. Though people can sometimes be liberal on one issue and conservative on another, a citizen to the left of liberalism, near socialism, would likely be happy with the passage of the Raise the Wage Act of 2021, which would eventually increase the minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 an hour. A citizen falling near conservatism would believe the Patriot Act is reasonable, because it allows the FBI and other government agencies to collect data on citizens’ phone calls and social media communications to monitor potential terrorism (Figure 6.7). A citizen to the right of the spectrum is more likely to favor cutting social services like unemployment and Medicaid.

[.my2]
一个人的意识形态在光谱上的位置可以让我们对其观点有所了解。虽然人们有时可能在某些问题上持自由主义立场，而在另一个问题上持保守主义立场，但一位立场偏左、接近社会主义的公民可能会乐见 2021 年《提高工资法案》的通过，该法案最终会将最低工资从每小时 7.25 美元提高到 15 美元。一位立场偏右的公民会认为《爱国者法案》是合理的，因为它允许联邦调查局和其他政府机构收集公民的电话和社交媒体通信数据，以监控潜在的恐怖主义活动（ 图 6.7 ）。一位立场偏右的公民则更倾向于削减失业救济金和医疗补助等社会服务。

A series of bar graphs showing differences in public opinion. The first graph asks “which statement comes closer to your view of the patriot act?”. Those who responded that they viewed it as “a necessary tool that helps government find terrorists” aligned to the following parties: 57% of republicans, 35% of democrats, and 37% of independents. Those who responded that “it goes too far and threatens to civil liberties” aligned as follows: 22% of republicans, 40% of democrats, and 42% of independents. The heading for the remaining graphs asks “Would you increase, decrease, or keep spending the same for…?”. When asked about health care, 58% of democrats would increase, and 35% would keep it the same; for republicans, 16% would increase, 40% would keep it the same, and 44% would decrease; for independents, 34% would increase, 43% would keep it the same, and 23% would decrease. When asked about unemployment assistance, 9% of republicans would increase, 35% of republicans would keep it the same, and 56% would decrease; for democrats, 41% would increase, 46% would keep it the same, and 13% would decrease; for independents, 20% would increase, 48% would keep it the same, and 32% would decrease. When asked about aid to needy in the U.S., 9% of republicans would increase, 42% would keep it the same, and 49% would decrease; for democrats, 39% would increase, 52% would keep it the same, and 9% would decrease; for independents, 28% would increase, 47% would keep it the same, 25% would decrease. When asked about the minimum wage, 50% of republicans would increase, 48% would keep it the same, and 2% would decrease; for democrats, 91% would increase, and 9% would keep it the same; for independents, 68% would increase, and 30% would keep it the same. When asked about environmental protection, 12% of republicans would increase, 48% would keep it the same, and 40% would decrease; for democrats, 52% would increase, 40% would keep it the same, and 8% would decrease; for independents, 31% would increase, 48% would keep it the same, and 21% would decrease. When asked about scientific research, 22% of republicans would increase, 46% would keep it the same, and 32% would decrease; for democrats, 47% would increase, 43% would keep it the same, and 10% would decrease; and for independents, 38% would increase, 41% would keep it the same., and 21% would decrease.
