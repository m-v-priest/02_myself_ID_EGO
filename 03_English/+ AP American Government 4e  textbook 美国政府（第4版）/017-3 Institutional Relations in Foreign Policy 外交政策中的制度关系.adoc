== 释义





Institutional relationships in foreign policy constitute a paradox. On the one hand, there are aspects of foreign policymaking that necessarily engage multiple branches of government and a multiplicity of actors. Indeed, there is a complexity to foreign policy that is bewildering, in terms of both substance and process. On the other hand, foreign policymaking can sometimes call for nothing more than for the president to make a formal decision, quickly endorsed by the legislative branch. This section will explore the institutional relationships present in U.S. foreign policymaking.

外交政策中的制度关系构成了一个悖论。一方面，外交政策制定必然涉及政府多个部门和众多参与者。事实上，外交政策的复杂性令人眼花缭乱，无论从实质还是过程来看皆是如此。另一方面，外交政策的制定有时可能仅仅需要总统做出正式决定，并迅速获得立法部门的批准。本节将探讨美国外交政策制定中存在的制度关系。

FOREIGN POLICY AND SHARED POWER
外交政策与共享权力
While presidents are more empowered by the Constitution in foreign than in domestic policy, they nonetheless must seek approval from Congress on a variety of matters; chief among these is the basic budgetary authority needed to run foreign policy programs. Indeed, most if not all of the foreign policy instruments described earlier in this chapter require interbranch approval to go into effect. Such approval may sometimes be a formality, but it is still important. Even a sole executive agreement often requires subsequent funding from Congress in order to be carried out, and funding calls for majority support from the House and Senate. Presidents lead, to be sure, but they must consult with and engage the Congress on many matters of foreign policy. Presidents must also delegate a great deal in foreign policy to the bureaucratic experts in the foreign policy agencies. Not every operation can be run from the West Wing of the White House.

[.my2]
尽管宪法赋予总统在外交政策方面的权力比在内政方面更大，但他们仍然需要在诸多事项上寻求国会的批准；其中最重要的是执行外交政策项目所需的基本预算授权。事实上，本章前面提到的绝大多数外交政策工具，即便不是全部，也需要跨部门批准才能生效。这种批准有时可能只是形式上的，但仍然至关重要。即使是行政部门单独签署的协议，通常也需要国会后续拨款才能执行，而拨款则需要众议院和参议院的多数支持。总统固然是领导者，但他们必须在许多外交政策问题上与国会进行磋商和沟通。总统还必须将外交政策中的许多工作委托给外交机构的专家。并非所有行动都能在白宫西翼完成。

At bottom, the United States is a separation-of-powers political system with authority divided among executive and legislative branches, including in the foreign policy realm. Table 17.1 shows the formal roles of the president and Congress in conducting foreign policy.

[.my2]
从根本上讲，美国是一个权力分立的政治体制，行政和立法部门的权力相互制衡，外交政策领域也不例外。 表 17.1 列出了总统和国会在外交政策制定中的正式角色。

Table 17.1
表 17.1
The main lesson of Table 17.1 is that nearly all major outputs of foreign policy require a formal congressional role in order to be carried out. Foreign policy might be done by executive say-so in times of crisis and in the handful of sole executive agreements that actually pertain to major issues (like the Iran Nuclear Agreement). In general, however, a consultative relationship between the branches in foreign policy is the usual result of their constitutional sharing of power. A president who ignores Congress on matters of foreign policy and does not keep them briefed may find later interactions on other matters more difficult. Probably the most extreme version of this potential dynamic occurred during the Eisenhower presidency. When President Dwight D. Eisenhower used too many executive agreements instead of sending key ones to the Senate as treaties, Congress reacted by considering a constitutional amendment (the Bricker Amendment) that would have altered the treaty process as we know it. Eisenhower understood the message and began to send more agreements through the process as treaties.10
表 17.1 的主要结论是，几乎所有重要的外交政策产出都需要国会的正式参与才能实施。在危机时期以及少数涉及重大问题的行政协议（例如伊朗核协议）中，外交政策或许可以由行政部门单方面决定。然而，通常情况下，外交政策各部门之间的协商关系是其宪法权力共享的必然结果。如果总统在外交政策问题上忽视国会，并且不向国会汇报情况，那么他日后在其他问题上的互动可能会更加困难。这种潜在动态最极端的例子可能出现在艾森豪威尔总统任期内。当德怀特·D·艾森豪威尔总统过多地使用行政协议，而不是将关键协议作为条约提交参议院时，国会考虑了一项宪法修正案（ 布里克修正案 ），该修正案将改变我们今天所知的条约程序。艾森豪威尔理解了国会的意图，并开始将更多协议作为条约提交参议院审议。 10

Shared power creates an incentive for the branches to cooperate. Even in the midst of a crisis, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, it is common for the president or senior staff to brief congressional leaders in order to keep them up to speed and ensure the country can stand unified on international matters. That said, there are areas of foreign policy where the president has more discretion, such as the operation of intelligence programs, the holding of foreign policy summits, and the mobilization of troops or agents in times of crisis. Moreover, presidents have more power and influence in foreign policymaking than they do in domestic policymaking. It is to that power that we now turn.

[.my2]
权力共享促使各部门开展合作。即使在危机之中，例如1962年的古巴导弹危机，总统或其高级幕僚也通常会向国会领导人通报情况，以确保他们及时了解最新动态，并确保国家在国际事务上保持团结。尽管如此，在外交政策的某些领域，总统拥有更大的自主权，例如情报项目的运作、外交政策峰会的召开以及危机时期军队或特工的调动。此外，总统在外交政策制定方面的权力和影响力远大于其在国内政策制定方面的权力和影响力。接下来，我们将探讨总统的这种权力。

THE TWO PRESIDENCIES THESIS
两任总统论
When the media cover a domestic controversy, such as social unrest or police brutality, reporters consult officials at different levels and in branches of government, as well as think tanks and advocacy groups. In contrast, when an international event occurs, such as a terrorist bombing in Paris or Brussels, the media flock predominately to one actor—the president of the United States—to get the official U.S. position.

[.my2]
当媒体报道国内争议事件，例如社会动荡或警察暴力执法时，记者会咨询各级政府官员、各部门官员，以及智库和倡导团体。相比之下，当发生国际事件，例如巴黎或布鲁塞尔的恐怖袭击时，媒体往往主要集中在一位人物——美国总统——身上，以获取美国的官方立场。

In the realm of foreign policy and international relations, the president occupies a leadership spot that is much clearer than in the realm of domestic policy. This dual domestic and international role has been described by the two presidencies thesis. This theory originated with University of California–Berkeley professor Aaron Wildavsky and suggests that there are two distinct presidencies, one for foreign policy and one for domestic policy, and that presidents are more successful in foreign than domestic policy. Let’s look at the reasoning behind this thesis.

[.my2]
在外交政策和国际关系领域，总统的领导地位远比在国内政策领域更为明确。这种兼顾国内和国际事务的双重角色可以用 “双重总统制”理论来解释。该理论由加州大学伯克利分校教授亚伦· 维尔达夫斯基提出，认为总统的职责分为两个截然不同的部分：外交政策和国内政策，并且总统在外交政策方面比在国内政策方面更为成功。让我们来看看这一理论背后的逻辑。

The Constitution names the president as the commander-in-chief of the military, the nominating authority for executive officials and ambassadors, and the initial negotiator of foreign agreements and treaties. The president is the agenda-setter for foreign policy and may move unilaterally in some instances. Beyond the Constitution, presidents were also gradually given more authority to enter into international agreements without Senate consent by using the executive agreement. We saw above that the passage of the War Powers Resolution in 1973, though intended as a statute to rein in executive power and reassert Congress as a check on the president, effectively gave presidents two months to wage war however they wish. Given all these powers, we have good reason to expect presidents to have more influence and be more successful in foreign than in domestic policy.

[.my2]
宪法规定总统是军队总司令、行政官员和大使的提名人，以及对外协议和条约的初步谈判者。总统是外交政策的制定者，在某些情况下可以单方面采取行动。除了宪法之外，总统还逐渐被赋予了更多权力，可以通过行政命令在未经参议院同意的情况下签署国际协议。正如上文所述，1973年通过的《战争权力决议》虽然旨在限制行政权力并重申国会对总统的制衡作用，但实际上却给了总统两个月的时间，让他们可以随心所欲地发动战争。鉴于总统拥有如此多的权力，我们有理由预期他们在外交政策上的影响力会比在内政政策上更大，也更容易取得成功。

A second reason for the stronger foreign policy presidency has to do with the informal aspects of power. In some eras, Congress will be more willing to allow the president to be a clear leader and speak for the country. For instance, the Cold War between the Eastern bloc countries (led by the Soviet Union) and the West (led by the United States and Western European allies) prompted many to want a single actor to speak for the United States. A willing Congress allowed the president to take the lead because of urgent circumstances (Figure 17.12). Much of the Cold War also took place when the parties in Congress included more moderates on both sides of the aisle and the environment was less partisan than today. A phrase often heard at that time was, “Partisanship stops at the water’s edge.” This means that foreign policy matters should not be subject to the bitter disagreements seen in party politics.

[.my2]
总统外交政策权力增强的第二个原因与权力的非正式层面有关。在某些时期，国会更愿意让总统成为明确的领导者，代表国家发声。例如，冷战时期，以苏联为首的东欧集团国家与以美国及其西欧盟友为首的西方阵营之间的冲突，促使许多人希望由一位单一的领导人代表美国发声。在当时的紧急情况下，国会愿意让总统发挥领导作用（ 图 17.12 ）。冷战时期，国会两党都包含更多温和派人士，党派斗争远不如今天激烈。当时人们常说的一句话是：“党派之争止于国界。” 这意味着外交政策不应像党派政治那样陷入激烈的争论。

Does the thesis’s expectation of a more successful foreign policy presidency apply today? While the president still has stronger foreign policy powers than domestic powers, the governing context has changed in two key ways. First, the Cold War ended in 1989 with the demolition of the Berlin Wall, the subsequent disintegration of the Soviet Union, and the eventual opening up of Eastern European territories to independence and democracy. These dramatic changes removed the competitive superpower aspect of the Cold War, in which the United States and the USSR were dueling rivals on the world stage. The absence of the Cold War has led to less of a rally-behind-the-president effect in the area of foreign policy.

[.my2]
该论点关于总统在外交政策方面会取得更大成功的预期在今天是否仍然适用？尽管总统在外交政策方面仍然比在国内政策方面拥有更大的权力，但治理环境在两个关键方面发生了变化。首先，随着柏林墙的倒塌、苏联的解体以及东欧地区最终走向独立和民主， 冷战在 1989 年结束。这些剧变消除了冷战时期超级大国竞争的局面，即美国和苏联在世界舞台上针锋相对的局面。冷战的结束导致在外交政策领域，民众对总统的拥护效应有所减弱。

Second, beginning in the 1980s and escalating in the 1990s, the Democratic and Republican parties began to become polarized in Congress. The moderate members in each party all but disappeared, while more ideologically motivated candidates began to win election to the House and later the Senate. Hence, the Democrats in Congress became more liberal on average, the Republicans became more conservative, and the moderates from each party, who had been able to work together, were edged out. It became increasingly likely that the party opposite the president in Congress might be more willing to challenge his initiatives, whereas in the past it was rare for the opposition party to publicly stand against the president in foreign policy.

[.my2]
其次，从20世纪80年代开始，并在90年代愈演愈烈，国会中的民主党和共和党开始出现两极分化。两党内部的温和派成员几乎消失殆尽，而意识形态更为激进的候选人开始赢得众议院席位，随后又进入参议院。因此，国会中的民主党人平均而言变得更加自由派，共和党人则变得更加保守，而原本能够合作的两党温和派则被边缘化。与总统在外交政策上公开反对总统的政党，在国会中挑战总统政策的可能性越来越大，而过去反对党在外交政策上公开反对总统的情况则十分罕见。

Finally, several analysts have tried applying the two presidencies thesis to contemporary presidential-congressional relationships in foreign policy. Is the two presidencies framework still valid in the more partisan post–Cold War era? The answer is mixed. On the one hand, presidents are more successful on foreign policy votes in the House and Senate, on average, than on domestic policy votes. However, the gap has narrowed. Moreover, analysis has also shown that presidents are opposed more often in Congress, even on the foreign policy votes they win.11 Democratic leaders regularly challenged Republican George W. Bush on the Iraq War and it became common to see the most senior foreign relations committee members of the Republican Party opposing the foreign policy positions of Democratic president Barack Obama. Such challenging of the president by the opposition party simply didn’t happen during the Cold War.

[.my2]
最后，一些分析人士尝试将“双总统制”理论应用于当代总统与国会在外交政策方面的关系。在后冷战时代党派斗争日益激烈的背景下，“双总统制”框架是否仍然有效？答案喜忧参半。一方面，总统在众议院和参议院的外交政策投票中平均比在内政投票中更容易获得通过。然而，这种差距已经缩小。此外，分析还表明，即使在总统赢得的外交政策投票中，他们在国会遭遇反对的次数也更多。11 位民主党领导人经常就伊拉克战争问题挑战共和党总统乔治·W·布什，共和党外交关系委员会的高级成员反对民主党总统巴拉克·奥巴马的外交政策立场也变得司空见惯。这种反对党对总统的挑战在冷战时期是根本不可能发生的。

In the Trump administration, there was a distinct shift in foreign policy style. While for some regions, like South America, Trump was content to let the foreign policy bureaucracies proceed as they always had, in certain areas, the president was pivotal in changing the direction of American foreign policy. For example, he stepped away from two key international agreements—the Iran-Nuclear Deal and the Paris climate change accords. Moreover, his actions in Syria were quite unilateral, employing bombing raids unilaterally on two occasions. This approach reflected more of a neoconservative foreign policy approach, similar to Obama's widespread use of drone strikes.

[.my2]
在特朗普政府时期，美国的外交政策风格发生了显著转变。虽然对于某些地区，例如南美，特朗普乐于让外交机构按部就班地行事，但在某些领域，总统在改变美国外交政策方向方面发挥了关键作用。例如，他退出了两项重要的国际协议——伊朗核协议和巴黎气候协定。此外，他在叙利亚的行动也相当单边，曾两次单方面发动空袭。这种做法更体现了一种新保守主义的外交政策，类似于奥巴马时期广泛使用无人机袭击的做法。

Therefore, it seems presidents no longer enjoy unanimous foreign policy support as they did in the early 1960s. They have to work harder to get a consensus and are more likely to face opposition. Still, because of their formal powers in foreign policy, presidents are overall more successful on foreign policy than on domestic policy.

[.my2]
因此，总统们似乎不再像20世纪60年代初那样享有外交政策上的一致支持。他们必须付出更多努力才能达成共识，也更有可能面临反对。尽管如此，由于总统在外交政策方面拥有正式权力，他们在外交政策上的总体成功率仍然高于内政政策。

THE PERSPECTIVE OF HOUSE AND SENATE MEMBERS
众议院和参议院议员的观点
Congress is a bicameral legislative institution with 100 senators serving in the Senate and 435 representatives serving in the House. How interested in foreign policy are typical House and Senate members?
国会是一个两院制立法机构，参议院有100名参议员，众议院有435名众议员。典型的参众两院议员对外交政策的兴趣有多大？

While key White House, executive, and legislative leaders monitor and regularly weigh in on foreign policy matters, the fact is that individual representatives and senators do so much less often. Unless there is a foreign policy crisis, legislators in Congress tend to focus on domestic matters, mainly because there is not much to be gained with their constituents by pursuing foreign policy matters.12 Domestic policy matters resonate more strongly with the voters at home. A sluggish economy, increasing health care costs, and crime matter more to them than U.S. policy toward North Korea, for example. In an open-ended Gallup poll question from early 2021 about the “most important problem” in the United States, fewer than 10 percent of respondents named a foreign policy topic (and most of those respondents mentioned immigration). These results suggest that foreign policy is not at the top of many voters’ minds. In the end, legislators must be responsive to constituents in order to be good representatives and to achieve reelection.13
尽管白宫、行政部门和立法机构的关键领导人会密切关注外交政策并定期发表意见，但事实上，个别众议员和参议员参与外交政策的频率要低得多。除非出现外交政策危机，否则国会议员往往更关注国内事务，这主要是因为在处理外交政策问题上，他们很难赢得选民的支持。 12 国内政策问题更能引起选民的共鸣。例如，经济低迷、医疗保健成本上涨和犯罪问题比美国对朝鲜的政策更能引起他们的关注。在 2021 年初盖洛普的一项关于美国“最重要问题”的开放式民意调查中，只有不到 10%的受访者提到了外交政策议题（而且其中大多数人提到的是移民问题）。这些结果表明，外交政策并非许多选民最为关注的问题。最终，议员必须对选民的需求做出回应，才能成为优秀的代表并成功连任。 13

However, some House and Senate members do wade into foreign policy matters. First, congressional party leaders in the majority and minority parties speak on behalf of their institution and their party on all types of issues, including foreign policy. Some House and Senate members ask to serve on the foreign policy committees, such as the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and the two defense committees (Figure 17.13). These members might have military bases within their districts or states and hence have a constituency reason for being interested in foreign policy. Legislators might also simply have a personal interest in foreign policy matters that drives their engagement in the issue. Finally, they may have ambitions to move into an executive branch position that deals with foreign policy matters, such as secretary of state or defense, CIA director, or even president.

[.my2]
然而，一些众议院和参议院议员确实会涉足外交政策事务。首先，国会多数党和少数党的党魁会代表各自的机构和党派就各类议题发表意见，包括外交政策。一些众议院和参议院议员会主动要求加入外交政策委员会，例如参议院外交关系委员会 、 众议院外交事务委员会以及两个国防委员会（ 图 17.13 ）。这些议员可能在其选区或所在州设有军事基地，因此出于选区利益的考量而关注外交政策。此外，议员们也可能出于个人兴趣参与外交政策事务。最后，他们或许还渴望进入负责外交政策事务的行政部门，例如国务卿、国防部长、中央情报局局长，甚至总统。

Most House and Senate members do not engage in foreign policy because there is no electoral benefit to doing so. Thus, when citizens become involved, House members and senators will take notice. Research by John Kingdon on roll-call voting and by Richard Hall on committee participation found that when constituents are activated, their interest becomes salient to a legislator and the legislator will respond.14
大多数众议院和参议院议员不参与外交政策，因为这样做对他们的选举没有好处。因此，当公民积极参与时，众议院和参议院议员就会注意到。约翰·金顿对唱名投票的研究以及理查德·霍尔对委员会参与的研究都发现，当选民被调动起来时，他们的利益就会引起立法者的重视，立法者也会做出回应。 14

One way you can become active in the foreign policy realm is by writing a letter or e-mail to your House member and/or your two U.S. senators about what you believe the U.S. foreign policy approach in a particular area ought to be. Perhaps you want the United States to work with other countries to protect dolphins from being accidentally trapped in tuna nets. You can also state your position in a letter to the editor of your local newspaper, or post an opinion on the newspaper’s website where a related article or op-ed piece appears. You can share links to news coverage on Facebook or Twitter and consider joining a foreign policy interest group such as Greenpeace.

[.my2]
参与外交政策领域的一个方法是，您可以写信或发邮件给您的众议员和/或两位参议员，表达您对美国在特定领域外交政策方针的看法。例如，您可能希望美国与其他国家合作，保护海豚免遭金枪鱼渔网的误捕。您也可以在当地报纸的编辑面前发表意见，或者在报纸网站上刊登相关文章或评论文章的地方发表评论。您还可以通过 Facebook 或 Twitter 分享新闻报道链接，并考虑加入绿色和平组织等外交政策兴趣团体。

When you engaged in foreign policy discussion as suggested above, what type of response did you receive?
当你按照上述建议参与外交政策讨论时，你收到了什么样的回应？

THE MANY ACTORS IN FOREIGN POLICY
外交政策中的众多参与者
A variety of actors carry out the various and complex activities of U.S. foreign policy: White House staff, executive branch staff, and congressional leaders.

[.my2]
美国外交政策的各项复杂活动由众多参与者共同执行：白宫工作人员、行政部门工作人员和国会领导人。

The White House staff members engaged in foreign policy are likely to have very regular contact with the president about their work. The national security advisor heads the president’s National Security Council, a group of senior-level staff from multiple foreign policy agencies, and is generally the president’s top foreign policy advisor. Also reporting to the president in the White House is the director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Even more important on intelligence than the CIA director is the director of national intelligence, a position created in the government reorganizations after 9/11, who oversees the entire intelligence community in the U.S. government. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consist of six members, one each from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines, plus a chair and vice chair. The chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the president’s top uniformed military officer. In contrast, the secretary of defense is head of the entire Department of Defense but is a nonmilitary civilian. The U.S. trade representative develops and directs the country’s international trade agenda. Finally, within the Executive Office of the President, another important foreign policy official is the director of the president’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The OMB director develops the president’s yearly budget proposal, including funding for the foreign policy agencies and foreign aid.

[.my2]
参与外交政策的白宫工作人员很可能与总统就其工作保持非常频繁的联系。国家安全顾问领导总统的国家安全委员会 ，该委员会由来自多个外交政策机构的高级官员组成，国家安全顾问通常是总统的首席外交政策顾问。 中央情报局 （CIA）局长也向总统汇报工作。在情报方面，比中央情报局局长更为重要的职位是国家情报总监，该职位是在 9/11 事件后的政府重组中设立的，负责监督美国政府的整个情报机构。 参谋长联席会议由六名成员组成，分别来自陆军、海军、空军和海军陆战队，另设主席和副主席。参谋长联席会议主席是总统的最高级别军官。相比之下，国防部长是整个国防部的首脑，但他是非军事文职人员。美国贸易代表负责制定和指导美国的国际贸易议程。最后，在总统行政办公室中，另一位重要的外交政策官员是总统管理和预算办公室 （OMB）主任。OMB 主任负责制定总统的年度预算提案，其中包括对外交政策机构和对外援助的拨款。

In addition to those who work directly in the White House or Executive Office of the President, several important officials work in the broader executive branch and report to the president in the area of foreign policy. Chief among these is the secretary of state. The secretary of state is the nation’s chief diplomat, serves in the president’s cabinet, and oversees the Foreign Service. The secretary of defense, who is the civilian (nonmilitary) head of the armed services housed in the Department of Defense, is also a key cabinet member for foreign policy (as mentioned above). A third cabinet secretary, the secretary of homeland security, is critically important in foreign policy, overseeing the massive Department of Homeland Security (Figure 17.14).

[.my2]
除了直接在白宫或总统行政办公室工作的官员外，还有几位重要官员在更广泛的行政部门任职，并向总统汇报外交政策。其中最重要的是国务卿。国务卿是美国首席外交官，是总统内阁成员，负责监督外交事务。国防部长是国防部下属武装部队的文职（非军事）首脑，也是负责外交政策的关键内阁成员（如上所述）。第三位内阁部长，国土安全部长，在外交政策中也至关重要，负责监督庞大的国土安全部 （ 图 17.14 ）。

A chart titled “Multiple foreign Policy Directors”. At the top of the chart are three boxes. The box on the left is labeled “Chief of Staff”, the center box is labeled “President”, and the box on the right is labeled “Vice President”. The boxes labeled “Chief of Staff” and “Vice President” are connected with dotted lines to the “President” box. Under the “President” box are seven boxes connected with solid lines. From left to right, the boxes are labeled “Secretary of State,” “Secretary of Defense”, “Secretary of Homeland Security”, “National Security Advisor”, “U.S. Trade Representative”, “Chair, Joint Chiefs of Staff”, “Director of National Intelligence (to whom the CIA director reports)”.

Insider Perspective  内部视角
Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates
前国防部长罗伯特·盖茨
Former secretary of defense Robert Gates served under both Republican and Democratic presidents. First Gates rose through the ranks of the CIA to become the director during the George H. W. Bush administration. He then left government to serve as an academic administrator at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas, where he rose to the position of university president. He was able to win over reluctant faculty and advance the university’s position, including increasing the faculty at a time when budgets were in decline in Texas. Then, when Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld resigned, President George W. Bush invited Gates to return to government service as Rumsfeld’s replacement. Gates agreed, serving in that capacity for the remainder of the Bush years and then for several years in the Obama administration before retiring from government service a second time (Figure 17.15). He has generally been seen as thorough, systematic, and fair.

前国防部长罗伯特·盖茨曾先后在共和党和民主党总统任内任职。盖茨最初在中央情报局步步高升，最终在老布什政府时期担任局长。之后，他离开政府，前往德克萨斯州大学城的德克萨斯农工大学担任学术行政职务，并最终升任校长。他成功赢得了起初并不情愿的教职工的支持，提升了大学的地位，包括在德克萨斯州预算缩减的情况下增加了教职工人数。后来，当国防部长唐纳德·拉姆斯菲尔德辞职时，小布什总统邀请盖茨重返政府部门接替拉姆斯菲尔德的职位。盖茨欣然接受，在布什政府剩余的任期内以及奥巴马政府的几年里一直担任国防部长，之后第二次从政府部门退休（ 图 17.15 ）。他通常被认为是一位做事认真、条理清晰且公正的人。

In his memoir, Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War,15 Secretary Gates takes issue with the actions of both the presidents for whom he worked, but ultimately he praises them for their service and for upholding the right principles in protecting the United States and U.S. military troops. In this and earlier books, Gates discusses the need to have an overarching plan but says plans cannot be too tight or they will fail when things change in the external environment. After leaving politics, Gates served as president of the Boy Scouts of America, where he presided over the change in policy that allowed openly gay scouts and leaders, an issue with which he had had experience as secretary of defense under President Obama. In that role Gates oversaw the end of the military’s “Don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.16
在回忆录 《职责：一位战时部长的回忆录》 中，盖茨部长对两位他曾效力过的总统的行为都提出了异议，但最终他还是赞扬了他们的贡献以及在保护美国和美军方面坚持的正确原则。在本书及他之前的著作中，盖茨都探讨了制定总体规划的必要性，但他同时指出，规划不能过于严密，否则一旦外部环境发生变化，规划就会失效。离开政坛后，盖茨担任美国童子军主席，并主持了允许公开同性恋身份的童子军成员和领导人加入的政策改革。此前，他曾在奥巴马总统任内担任国防部长，处理过类似的问题。在担任国防部长期间，盖茨还监督了军队“不问不说”政策的废除。

What do you think about a cabinet secretary serving presidents from two different political parties? Is this is a good idea? Why or why not?
你认为一位内阁部长同时为来自两个不同政党的总统服务如何？这是否是个好主意？为什么？

The final group of official key actors in foreign policy are in the U.S. Congress. The Speaker of the House, the House minority leader, and the Senate majority and minority leaders are often given updates on foreign policy matters by the president or the president’s staff. They are also consulted when the president needs foreign policy support or funding. However, the experts in Congress who are most often called on for their views are the committee chairs and the highest-ranking minority members of the relevant House and Senate committees. In the House, that means the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Committee on Armed Services. In the Senate, the relevant committees are the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Armed Services Committee. These committees hold regular hearings on key foreign policy topics, consider budget authorizations, and debate the future of U.S. foreign policy.

外交政策中最后一类重要的官方参与者是美国国会。众议院议长、众议院少数党领袖以及参议院多数党和少数党领袖通常会收到总统或其幕僚关于外交政策的最新汇报。当总统需要外交政策支持或资金时，也会咨询他们的意见。然而，国会中最常被征询意见的专家是相关众议院和参议院委员会的主席以及级别最高的少数党成员。在众议院，这意味着外交事务委员会和军事委员会。在参议院，相关委员会是外交关系委员会和军事委员会。这些委员会定期就关键外交政策议题举行听证会，审议预算授权，并讨论美国外交政策的未来走向。
