== 释义




It is one thing to win an election; it is quite another to govern, as many frustrated presidents have discovered. Critical to a president’s success in office is the ability to make a deft transition from the previous administration, including naming a cabinet and filling other offices. The new chief executive must also fashion an agenda, which they will often preview in general terms in an inaugural address. Presidents usually embark upon their presidency benefitting from their own and the nation’s renewed hope and optimism, although often unrealistic expectations set the stage for subsequent disappointment.

赢得选举是一回事，而执政则是另一回事，许多郁郁不得志的总统都深有体会。总统能否成功执政的关键在于能否巧妙地完成与前任政府的交接，包括组建内阁和填补其他职位空缺。新任总统还必须制定施政纲领，通常会在就职演说中概述其大致内容。总统上任之初，往往受益于自身和国家重燃的希望和乐观情绪，但往往不切实际的期望最终会导致失望。

TRANSITION AND APPOINTMENTS
过渡与任命
In the immediate aftermath of the election, the incoming and outgoing administrations work together to help facilitate the transfer of power. While the General Services Administration oversees the logistics of the process, such as office assignments, information technology, and the assignment of keys, prudent candidates typically prepare for a possible victory by appointing members of a transition team during the lead-up to the general election. The success of the team’s actions becomes apparent on inauguration day, when the transition of power takes place in what is often a seamless fashion, with people evacuating their offices (and the White House) for their successors.

选举结束后，新老两届政府会立即携手合作，协助权力交接。虽然美国总务署负责监督交接过程中的各项后勤工作，例如办公室分配、信息技术以及钥匙交接等，但谨慎的候选人通常会在大选前夕任命过渡团队成员，为可能出现的胜选做好准备。过渡团队的工作成效在就职典礼当天便会显现，届时权力交接往往进行得十分顺利，相关人员会及时腾出办公室（以及白宫），为继任者腾出空间。

Among the president-elect’s more important tasks is the selection of a cabinet. George Washington’s cabinet was made up of only four people, the attorney general and the secretaries of the Departments of War, State, and the Treasury. Currently, however, there are fifteen members of the cabinet, including the Secretaries of Labor, Agriculture, Education, and others (Figure 12.9). The most important members—the heads of the Departments of Defense, Justice, State, and the Treasury (echoing Washington’s original cabinet)—receive the most attention from the president, the Congress, and the media. These four departments have been referred to as the inner cabinet, while the others are called the outer cabinet. When selecting a cabinet, presidents consider ability, expertise, influence, and reputation. More recently, presidents have also tried to balance political and demographic representation (gender, race, religion, and other considerations) to produce a cabinet that is capable as well as descriptively representative, meaning that those in the cabinet look like the U.S. population (see the chapter on bureaucracy and the term “representative bureaucracy”). A recent president who explicitly stated this as his goal was Bill Clinton, who talked about an “E.G.G. strategy” for senior-level appointments, where the E stands for ethnicity, G for gender, and the second G for geography.

当选总统最重要的任务之一是组建内阁 。乔治·华盛顿的内阁只有四人：司法部长、陆军部长、国务院部长和财政部长。然而，如今的内阁成员已达十五人，包括劳工部长、农业部长、教育部长等（ 图 12.9 ）。其中最重要的成员——国防部长、司法部长、国务院部长和财政部长（与华盛顿最初的内阁相同）——最受总统、国会和媒体的关注。这四个部门被称为核心内阁，而其他部门则被称为外层内阁。总统在组建内阁时，会考虑候选人的能力、专业知识、影响力以及声誉。近年来，总统们也试图平衡政治代表性和人口代表性（性别、种族、宗教和其他因素），以组建一个既有能力又具有代表性的内阁，也就是说，内阁成员的构成应与美国人口构成相符（参见关于官僚机构和“代表性官僚机构”的章节）。比尔·克林顿总统就曾明确表示，这是他组建内阁的目标。他提出了“EGG 战略”，用于高层任命，其中 E 代表种族，G 代表性别，第二个 G 代表地域。

Once the new president has been inaugurated and can officially nominate people to fill cabinet positions, the Senate confirms or rejects these nominations. At times, though rarely, cabinet nominations have failed to be confirmed or have even been withdrawn because of questions raised about the past behavior of the nominee.25 Prominent examples of such failures were Senator John Tower for defense secretary (George H. W. Bush) and Zoe Baird for attorney general (Bill Clinton): Senator Tower’s indiscretions involving alcohol and womanizing led to concerns about his fitness to head the military and his rejection by the Senate,26 whereas Zoe Baird faced controversy and withdrew her nomination when it was revealed, through what the press dubbed “Nannygate,” that house staff of hers were undocumented workers. These two cases are emblematic of a change in how presidential nominations fail in the Senate. Failures used to involve outright rejections in committee votes or floor votes, like the Tower case. More recently, failures typically die of inattention. However, these cases are rare exceptions to the rule, which is to give approval to the nominees that the president wishes to have in the cabinet. Other possible candidates for cabinet posts may decline to be considered for a number of reasons, from the reduction in pay that can accompany entrance into public life to unwillingness to be subjected to the vetting process that accompanies a nomination.

[.my2]
新总统就职后，即可正式提名内阁成员，参议院负责确认或否决这些提名。虽然这种情况很少见，但有时内阁提名会因被提名人过往行为受到质疑而未能获得确认，甚至被撤回。25 此类失败的典型例子包括：约翰· 陶尔参议员被提名为国防部长（老布什总统），以及佐伊·贝尔德被提名为司法部长（克林顿总统）。陶尔参议员酗酒和滥交的丑闻引发了人们对他是否适合领导军队的担忧，最终导致参议院否决了他的提名 。26 而贝尔德则面临争议，在媒体所谓的“保姆门”事件曝光其家政人员为非法移民后，她撤回了提名。这两个案例体现了总统提名在参议院失败方式的转变。过去，提名失败通常表现为委员会投票或全体投票中被直接否决，例如陶尔的案例。而近年来，提名失败往往是因为无人关注而不了了之。然而，这些情况只是极少数例外，通常的做法是批准总统希望进入内阁的提名人选。其他可能的内阁候选人可能出于各种原因拒绝被考虑，例如进入公职可能导致薪酬下降，或者不愿意接受提名过程中的审查程序。

Also subject to Senate approval are a number of non-cabinet subordinate administrators in the various departments of the executive branch, as well as the administrative heads of several agencies and commissions. These include the heads of the Internal Revenue Service, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Office of Management and Budget, the Federal Reserve, the Social Security Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Labor Relations Board, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is the president’s own budget department. In addition to preparing the executive budget proposal and overseeing budgetary implementation during the federal fiscal year, the OMB oversees the actions of the executive bureaucracy.

[.my2]
此外，行政部门各部门的一些非内阁下级行政官员，以及若干机构和委员会的行政首长，也需经参议院批准。这些机构包括国税局局长、中央情报局局长、管理和预算办公室局长、联邦储备委员会局长、社会保障署局长、环境保护署局长、国家劳工关系委员会局长和平等就业机会委员会局长。 管理和预算办公室 （OMB）是总统的预算部门。除了编制行政预算提案和监督联邦财政年度的预算执行情况外，OMB 还负责监督行政机构的运作。

Not all the non-cabinet positions are open at the beginning of an administration, but presidents move quickly to install their preferred choices in most roles when given the opportunity. Finally, new presidents usually take the opportunity to nominate new ambassadors, whose appointments are subject to Senate confirmation. New presidents make thousands of new appointments in their first two years in office. All the senior cabinet agency positions and nominees for all positions in the Executive Office of the President are made as presidents enter office or when positions become vacant during their presidency. Federal judges serve for life. Therefore, vacancies for the federal courts and the U.S. Supreme Court occur gradually as judges retire.

[.my2]
并非所有非内阁职位在政府就职之初都空缺，但总统一旦有机会，便会迅速将自己属意的人选安插到大多数职位上。此外，新总统通常会借此机会提名新的大使，这些任命需经参议院确认。新总统在其任期头两年内会进行数千项新的任命。所有高级内阁机构职位以及总统行政办公室所有职位的提名人选，都是在总统就职时或在任期内职位空缺时确定的。联邦法官终身任职。因此，联邦法院和美国最高法院的空缺会随着法官的退休而逐渐出现。

Throughout much of the history of the republic, the Senate has closely guarded its constitutional duty to consent to the president’s nominees, although in the end it nearly always confirms them. Still, the Senate does occasionally hold up a nominee. Benjamin Fishbourn, President George Washington’s nomination for a minor naval post, was rejected largely because he had insulted a particular senator.27 Other rejected nominees included Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell, nominated for the U.S. Supreme Court by President Nixon; Theodore Sorensen, nominated by President Carter for director of the Central Intelligence Agency; and John Tower, discussed earlier. At other times, the Senate has used its power to rigorously scrutinize the president’s nominees (Figure 12.10). Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, who faced numerous sexual harassment charges from former employees, was forced to sit through repeated questioning of his character and past behavior during Senate hearings, something he referred to as “a high-tech lynching for uppity Blacks.”28
在共和国历史的大部分时期，参议院都严格恪守其宪法赋予的同意总统提名的职责，尽管最终几乎总是予以确认。然而，参议院也偶尔会否决提名。例如，乔治·华盛顿总统提名本杰明·菲什伯恩担任海军一个次要职位，但菲什伯恩的提名被否决，主要原因是菲什伯恩曾侮辱过一位参议员。 27 其他被否决的提名人包括：尼克松总统提名的美国最高法院大法官克莱门特·海恩斯沃思和 G·哈罗德·卡斯韦尔；卡特总统提名的中央情报局局长西奥多·索伦森；以及前文提到的约翰·陶尔。在其他情况下，参议院也曾行使权力，对总统的提名进行严格审查（ 图 12.10 ）。最高法院提名人克拉伦斯·托马斯曾面临多名前雇员的性骚扰指控，在参议院听证会上被迫反复接受对其品格和过往行为的质询，他称之为“对桀骜不驯的黑人的高科技私刑” 。28

More recently, the Senate has attempted a new strategy, refusing to hold hearings at all, a strategy of defeat that scholars have referred to as “malign neglect.”29 Despite the fact that one-third of U.S. presidents have appointed a Supreme Court justice in an election year, when Associate Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly in early 2016, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell declared that the Senate would not hold hearings on a nominee until after the upcoming presidential election.30 McConnell remained adamant even after President Barack Obama, saying he was acting in fulfillment of his constitutional duty, nominated Merrick Garland, longtime chief judge of the federal Circuit Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. Garland was highly respected by senators from both parties and had won confirmation to his DC circuit position by a 76–23 vote in the Senate. When Republican Donald Trump was elected president in the fall, this strategy appeared to pay off. The Republican Senate and Judiciary Committee confirmed Trump's nominee, Neil Gorsuch, in April 2017, exercising the so-called "nuclear option," which allowed Republicans to break the Democrats' filibuster of the nomination by a simple majority vote. Ultimately, Senator McConnell reversed his "proximity to the next election" explanation for waiting to fill a Supreme Court vacancy when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away just prior to the 2020 election and McConnell and the Republicans quickly processed and confirmed Justice Amy Coney Barrett.

[.my2]
最近，参议院尝试了一种新策略，即完全拒绝举行听证会，这种失败策略被学者们称为“ 恶意忽视 ”。 29 尽管三分之一的美国总统会在选举年任命最高法院大法官，但当大法官安东宁· 斯卡利亚于 2016 年初意外去世时，参议院多数党领袖米奇· 麦康奈尔宣布，参议院在即将到来的总统选举之前不会就提名人选举行听证会。 30 即使在巴拉克·奥巴马总统以履行宪法职责为由提名梅里克· 加兰 （长期担任哥伦比亚特区联邦巡回上诉法院首席法官）之后，麦康奈尔仍然坚持己见。加兰深受两党参议员的尊敬，并以 76 比 23 的投票结果在参议院获得哥伦比亚特区巡回上诉法院的任命。当共和党人唐纳德·特朗普在秋季当选总统后，这一策略似乎奏效了。 2017 年 4 月，共和党控制的参议院和司法委员会确认了特朗普提名的尼尔·戈萨奇，动用了所谓的“核选项”，即以简单多数票打破民主党对提名的阻挠。最终，在 2020 年大选前夕，露丝·巴德·金斯伯格大法官去世后，麦康奈尔参议员推翻了他之前以“临近下次选举”为由推迟填补最高法院空缺的解释，并迅速批准了艾米·科尼·巴雷特大法官的任命。

Other presidential selections are not subject to Senate approval, including the president’s personal staff (whose most important member is the White House chief of staff) and various advisers (most notably the national security adviser). The Executive Office of the President, created by Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR), contains a number of advisory bodies, including the Council of Economic Advisers, the National Security Council, the OMB, and the Office of the Vice President. Presidents also choose political advisers, speechwriters, and a press secretary to manage the politics and the message of the administration. In recent years, the president’s staff has become identified by the name of the place where many of its members work: the West Wing of the White House. These people serve at the pleasure of the president, and often the president reshuffles or reforms the staff during the term. Just as government bureaucracy has expanded over the centuries, so has the White House staff, which under Abraham Lincoln numbered a handful of private secretaries and a few minor functionaries. A recent report pegged the number of employees working within the White House over 450.31 When the staff in nearby executive buildings of the Executive Office of the President are added in, that number increases four-fold.

[.my2]
总统的其他任命无需参议院批准，包括总统的私人幕僚（其中最重要的成员是白宫办公厅主任）和各类顾问（最值得注意的是国家安全顾问）。由富兰克林· 罗斯福（FDR） 创建的总统行政办公室下设多个咨询机构，包括经济顾问委员会、国家安全委员会、管理和预算办公室（OMB）以及副总统办公室。总统还会任命政治顾问、演讲稿撰写人和新闻秘书，负责管理政府的政治事务和对外宣传。近年来，总统幕僚通常以其办公地点——白宫西翼——的名称来指代。这些人由总统任命，总统经常在任期内对幕僚进行调整或改组。正如政府官僚机构在几个世纪以来不断扩张一样，白宫幕僚团队也在不断壮大。在亚伯拉罕·林肯时期，白宫幕僚只有寥寥几位私人秘书和一些低级官员。最近的一份报告显示，白宫的员工人数超过 450 人 。31 如果将总统行政办公室附近行政大楼的工作人员也算在内，这个数字将增加四倍。

No Fun at Recess: Dueling Loopholes and the Limits of Presidential Appointments
课间休息无乐趣：相互冲突的漏洞与总统任命的局限性
When Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly in early 2016, many in Washington braced for a political sandstorm of obstruction and accusations. Such was the record of Supreme Court nominations during the Obama administration and, indeed, for the last few decades. Nor is this phenomenon restricted to nominations for the highest court in the land. The Senate has been known to occasionally block or slow appointments not because the quality of the nominee was in question but rather as a general protest against the policies of the president and/or as part of the increasing partisan bickering that occurs when the presidency is controlled by one political party and the Senate by the other. This occurred, for example, when the Senate initially refused to nominate anyone to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, established in 2011, because Republicans disliked the existence of the bureau itself.

[.my2]
2016 年初，最高法院大法官安东宁· 斯卡利亚意外去世，华盛顿许多人预料到一场政治风暴即将到来，届时将充斥着阻挠和指责。 奥巴马执政期间，乃至过去几十年，最高法院的提名都屡见不鲜。而且，这种现象并非仅限于最高法院的提名。众所周知，参议院有时会阻挠或拖延任命，并非因为被提名人的能力有问题，而是出于对总统政策的普遍抗议，或是因为总统职位由一个政党掌控、参议院由另一个政党控制时，党派纷争日益加剧。例如，2011 年成立的消费者金融保护局（CFPB）成立之初，参议院就拒绝提名任何人担任局长，因为共和党人不喜欢该机构的存在。

Such political holdups, however, tend to be the exception rather than the rule. For example, historically, nominees to the presidential cabinet are rarely rejected. And each Congress oversees the approval of around four thousand civilian and sixty-five thousand military appointments from the executive branch.32 The overwhelming majority of these are confirmed in a routine and systematic fashion, and only rarely do holdups occur. But when they do, the Constitution allows for a small presidential loophole called the recess appointment. The relevant part of Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution reads:
然而，此类政治阻挠往往是例外而非普遍现象。例如，历史上总统内阁提名人很少被否决。而且，每届国会都要监督批准行政部门约 4000 名文职人员和 65000 名军官的任命。 32 绝大多数任命都以例行且系统的方式获得确认，阻挠的情况极为罕见。但即便如此，宪法也允许总统利用一项名为“休会任命”的漏洞。宪法第二条第二款的相关内容如下：

“The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.”
“总统有权在参议院休会期间填补所有空缺，方法是授予委任状，委任状有效期至参议院下一届会议结束时。”

The purpose of the provision was to give the president the power to temporarily fill vacancies during times when the Senate was not in session and could not act. But presidents have typically used this loophole to get around a Senate that’s inclined to obstruct. Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush made 139 and 171 recess appointments, respectively. President Obama made far fewer recess appointments, with a total of only thirty-two during his presidency.33 One reason this number is so low is another loophole the Senate began using at the end of George W. Bush’s presidency, the pro forma session.

[.my2]
该条款的目的是赋予总统在参议院休会期间临时填补空缺的权力。但总统们通常会利用这一漏洞绕过倾向于阻挠的参议院。比尔 ·克林顿总统和乔治·W· 布什总统分别在休会期间任命了 139 名和 171 名官员。奥巴马总统的休会任命数量则少得多，在其总统任期内总共只有 32 名。 33 造成这一数字如此之低的原因之一是参议院在乔治·W·布什总统任期末期开始使用的另一个漏洞——形式会议。

A pro forma session is a short meeting held with the understanding that no work will be done. These sessions have the effect of keeping the Senate officially in session while functionally in recess. In 2012, President Obama decided to ignore the pro forma session and make four recess appointments anyway. The Republicans in the Senate were furious and contested the appointments. Eventually, the Supreme Court had the final say in a 2014 decision that declared unequivocally that “the Senate is in session when it says it is.”34 For now at least, the court’s ruling means that the president’s loophole and the Senate’s loophole cancel each other out. It seems they’ve found the middle ground whether they like it or not.

[.my2]
形式会议是指在不进行任何实际工作的前提下举行的简短会议。这些会议实际上使参议院在休会期间仍保持开会状态。2012 年，奥巴马总统决定无视形式会议，仍然在休会期间任命了四位官员。参议院的共和党人对此感到愤怒，并对这些任命提出异议。最终，最高法院在 2014 年的一项裁决中做出了最终裁决，明确宣布“参议院何时开会，就何时结束”。 34 至少目前来看，法院的裁决意味着总统的漏洞和参议院的漏洞相互抵消了。看来，无论他们是否愿意，他们都找到了折衷方案。

What might have been the legitimate original purpose of the recess appointment loophole? Do you believe the Senate is unfairly obstructing by effectively ending recesses altogether so as to prevent the president from making appointments without its approval?
休会任命漏洞最初的合法目的是什么？您是否认为参议院通过彻底取消休会来阻止总统未经其批准进行任命，这种做法是不公平的阻挠？

The most visible, though arguably the least powerful, member of a president’s cabinet is the vice president. Throughout most of the nineteenth and into the twentieth century, the vast majority of vice presidents took very little action in the office unless fate intervened. Few presidents consulted with their running mates. Indeed, until the twentieth century, many presidents had little to do with the naming of their running mate at the nominating convention. The office was seen as a form of political exile, and that motivated Republicans to name Theodore Roosevelt as William McKinley’s running mate in 1900. The strategy was to get the ambitious politician out of the way while still taking advantage of his popularity. This scheme backfired, however, when McKinley was assassinated and Roosevelt became president (Figure 12.11).

[.my2]
总统内阁中最引人注目，但或许也是权力最小的成员是副总统 。在 19 世纪的大部分时间以及 20 世纪初期，除非命运另有安排，否则绝大多数副总统在任期间几乎不采取任何行动。很少有总统会咨询他们的竞选搭档。事实上，直到 20 世纪，许多总统在提名大会上几乎不参与竞选搭档的提名。副总统职位被视为一种政治流放，这促使共和党在 1900 年提名西奥多· 罗斯福作为威廉·麦金莱的竞选搭档。他们的策略是让这位雄心勃勃的政治家暂时退出政坛，同时又能利用他的高人气。然而，这一计划最终适得其反， 麦金莱遇刺身亡，罗斯福继任总统（ 图 12.11 ）。

Vice presidents were often sent on minor missions or used as mouthpieces for the administration, often with a sharp edge. Richard Nixon’s vice president Spiro Agnew is an example. But in the 1970s, starting with Jimmy Carter, presidents made a far more conscious effort to make their vice presidents part of the governing team, placing them in charge of increasingly important issues. Sometimes, as in the case of Bill Clinton and Al Gore, the partnership appeared to be smooth if not always harmonious. In the case of George W. Bush and his very experienced vice president Dick Cheney, observers speculated whether the vice president might have exercised too much influence. Barack Obama’s choice for a running mate and subsequent two-term vice president, former Senator Joseph Biden, was picked for his experience, especially in foreign policy. President Obama relied on Vice President Biden for advice throughout his tenure. President Trump relied on Vice President Mike Pence to lead initiatives on health care reform and COVID-19, and Pence would gather West Wing officials and Cabinet members together, when Trump was occupied with other matters, in a manner atypical for a vice president. During his term of office, President Joe Biden involved Vice President Kamala Harris in every important policy discussion and has charged her with leading discussion of border control matters Figure 12.12. President Donald Trump involves Vice President JD Vance in many oval office meetings, including those involving international issues. In any case, the vice presidency is no longer quite as weak as it once was, and a capable vice president can do much to augment the president’s capacity to govern across issues if the president so desires.35
副总统通常被派去执行一些次要任务，或者充当政府的传声筒，而且往往言辞犀利。理查德· 尼克松的副总统斯皮罗· 阿格纽就是一个例子。但到了 20 世纪 70 年代，从吉米·卡特开始，总统们更加有意识地让副总统成为执政团队的一员，并让他们负责越来越重要的事务。有时，比如比尔 ·克林顿和阿尔· 戈尔 ，这种合作关系看似顺畅，尽管并非总是和谐。而乔治·W·布什和他经验丰富的副总统迪克· 切尼的例子，则引发了人们的猜测：副总统的影响力是否过大。巴拉克· 奥巴马选择前参议员约瑟夫· 拜登作为竞选搭档，并最终担任两届副总统，正是看中了他的经验，尤其是在外交政策方面。奥巴马总统在其任期内一直依赖拜登副总统的建议。特朗普总统依靠副总统迈克·彭斯领导医疗改革和新冠疫情应对等举措，当特朗普忙于其他事务时，彭斯会召集白宫西翼官员和内阁成员开会，这种做法对于副总统而言并不常见。在乔·拜登总统任期内，他让副总统卡马拉· 哈里斯参与每一项重要的政策讨论，并委任她主导边境管控问题的讨论（ 图 12.12） 。唐纳德·特朗普总统则让副总统 JD·万斯参与许多椭圆形办公室会议，包括涉及国际问题的会议。 总之，副总统的权力已不如以往那么弱小，如果总统愿意，一位能干的副总统可以大大增强总统在各个领域的执政能力。35

FORGING AN AGENDA  制定议程
Having secured election, the incoming president must soon decide how to deliver upon what was promised during the campaign. The chief executive must set priorities, chose what to emphasize, and formulate strategies to get the job done. He or she labors under the shadow of a measure of presidential effectiveness known as the first hundred days in office, a concept popularized during Franklin Roosevelt’s first term in the 1930s. While one hundred days is possibly too short a time for any president to boast of any real accomplishments, most presidents do recognize that they must address their major initiatives during their first two years in office. This is the time when the president is most powerful and is given the benefit of the doubt by the public and the media (aptly called the honeymoon period), especially if entering the White House with a politically aligned Congress, as Barack Obama did. However, recent history suggests that even one-party control of Congress and the presidency does not ensure efficient policymaking. This difficulty is due as much to divisions within the governing party as to obstructionist tactics skillfully practiced by the minority party in Congress. Democratic president Jimmy Carter’s battles with a Congress controlled by Democratic majorities provide a good case in point.

当选后，新任总统必须尽快决定如何兑现竞选期间的承诺。这位最高行政长官必须设定优先事项，选择重点，并制定完成工作的策略。他/她面临着一项衡量总统执政效能的指标——“执政百日”，这一概念在富兰克林·罗斯福20世纪30年代的第一个任期内广为流传。虽然一百天对于任何一位总统来说都可能太短，不足以让他们炫耀任何真正的成就，但大多数总统都意识到，他们必须在执政的头两年内推进其主要举措。这段时期是总统权力最大、最受公众和媒体信任的时期（恰如其分地被称为“蜜月期”），尤其是当总统像巴拉克·奥巴马那样，与一个政治立场一致的国会共同入主白宫时。然而，近期的历史表明，即使是同一政党同时掌控国会和总统职位，也并不能保证政策制定的效率。这种困难既源于执政党内部的分裂，也源于国会少数党巧妙的阻挠策略。民主党总统吉米·卡特与民主党占多数席位的国会之间的斗争就是一个很好的例子。

The incoming president must deal to some extent with the outgoing president’s last budget proposal. While some modifications can be made, it is more difficult to pursue new initiatives immediately. Most presidents are well advised to prioritize what they want to achieve during the first year in office and not lose control of their agenda. At times, however, unanticipated events can determine policy, as happened in 2001 when nineteen hijackers perpetrated the worst terrorist attack in U.S. history and transformed U.S. foreign and domestic policy in dramatic ways.

新任总统必须在一定程度上处理卸任总统的最后一份预算提案。虽然可以进行一些修改，但立即推行新举措则更为困难。大多数总统都应该优先考虑上任第一年想要实现的目标，并保持对议程的掌控。然而，有时，意想不到的事件会左右政策走向，例如2001年，19名劫机者发动了美国历史上最严重的恐怖袭击，并彻底改变了美国的外交和内政政策。

Moreover, presidents must be sensitive to what some scholars have termed “political time,” meaning the circumstances under which they assume power. Sometimes, the nation is prepared for drastic proposals to solve deep and pressing problems that cry out for immediate solutions, as was the case following the 1932 election of FDR at the height of the Great Depression. Most times, however, the country is far less inclined to accept revolutionary change. Being an effective president means recognizing the difference.36
此外，总统必须对一些学者所称的“政治时机”保持敏感，即他们就任总统时的具体情况。有时，国家乐于接受旨在解决亟需立即解决的深层次紧迫问题的激进方案，例如 1932 年罗斯福当选总统时正值大萧条时期。然而，大多数时候，国家并不倾向于接受革命性的变革。一位高效的总统必须能够认识到这种差异 。36

The first act undertaken by the new president—the delivery of an inaugural address—can do much to set the tone for what is intended to follow. While such an address may be an exercise in rhetorical inspiration, it also allows the president to set forth priorities within the overarching vision of what they intend to do. Abraham Lincoln used his inaugural addresses to calm rising concerns in the South that he would act to overturn slavery. Unfortunately, this attempt at appeasement fell on deaf ears, and the country descended into civil war. Franklin Roosevelt used his first inaugural address to boldly proclaim that the country need not fear the change that would deliver it from the grip of the Great Depression, and he set to work immediately enlarging the federal government to that end. John F. Kennedy, who entered the White House at the height of the Cold War, made an appeal to talented young people around the country to help him make the world a better place. He followed up with new institutions like the Peace Corps, which sends young citizens around the world to work as secular missionaries for American values like democracy and free enterprise.

新总统上任后的第一件事——发表就职演说 ——往往能为他接下来的施政定下基调。就职演说既是展现雄辩技巧的舞台，也是总统阐述其总体施政愿景和优先事项的平台。亚伯拉罕·林肯曾利用就职演说安抚南方日益增长的担忧，即他会采取行动废除奴隶制。然而，这种安抚之举却无人理睬，最终导致国家陷入内战。富兰克林·罗斯福则在首次就职演说中大胆宣告，国家无需惧怕变革，因为变革将带领国家摆脱大萧条的泥潭。为此，他立即着手扩大联邦政府的规模。约翰·F·肯尼迪在冷战高峰期入主白宫，他向全国各地的青年才俊发出号召，希望他们能与他携手共建更美好的世界。随后，他又创立了和平队等新机构，该机构派遣年轻公民到世界各地，作为世俗传教士传播民主和自由企业等美国价值观。
