== 释义





A dry description of the function of congressional leadership and the many committees and subcommittees in Congress may suggest that the drafting and amending of legislation is a finely tuned process that has become ever more refined over the course of the last few centuries. In reality, however, committees are more likely to kill legislation than to pass it. And the last few decades have seen a dramatic transformation in the way Congress does business. Creative interpretations of rules and statutes have turned small loopholes into the large gateways through which much congressional work now gets done. In this section, we will explore both the traditional legislative route by which a bill becomes a law and the modern incarnation of the process. We will also learn how and why the transformation occurred.

对国会领导层及其众多委员会和小组委员会职能的枯燥描述，可能会让人觉得立法的起草和修改是一个精细复杂的过程，并且在过去几个世纪中不断完善。然而，实际上，委员会否决法案的可能性远大于通过法案的可能性。过去几十年，国会的运作方式发生了翻天覆地的变化。对规则和法规的创造性解读，使得原本细小的漏洞变成了如今国会开展大量工作的“门户”。在本节中，我们将探讨法案成为法律的传统立法途径，以及这一过程的现代形式。我们还将了解这种转变发生的原因和方式。

THE CLASSIC LEGISLATIVE PROCESS
经典立法程序
The traditional process by which a bill becomes a law is called the classic legislative process. First, legislation must be drafted. Theoretically, anyone can do this. Much successful legislation has been initially drafted by someone who is not a member of Congress, such as a think tank or advocacy group, or the president. However, Congress is under no obligation to read or introduce this legislation, and only a bill introduced by a member of Congress can hope to become law. Even the president must rely on legislators to introduce that president's legislative agenda.

[.my2]
法案最终成为法律的传统流程被称为经典立法程序 。首先，必须起草法案。理论上，任何人都可以起草法案。许多成功的法案最初并非由国会议员起草，例如智库、倡导团体或总统。然而，国会没有义务阅读或提交这些法案，只有由国会议员提交的法案才有可能成为法律。即使是总统，也必须依靠立法者来提交其立法议程。

Technically, bills that raise revenue, like tax bills, must begin in the House. This exception is encoded within the Constitution in Article I, Section 7, which states, “All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills.” Yet, despite the seemingly clear language of the Constitution, Congress has found ways to get around this rule.

[.my2]
严格来说，诸如税收法案之类的增收法案必须由众议院发起。这一例外规定在宪法第一条第七款中明确列出，该款规定：“所有增收法案均应由众议院发起；但参议院可以像处理其他法案一样提出或同意修正案。”然而，尽管宪法的措辞看似清晰，国会却找到了规避这一规则的方法。

Once legislation has been proposed, however, the majority leadership consults with the parliamentarian about which committee to send it to. Each chamber has a parliamentarian, an advisor, typically a trained lawyer, who has studied the long and complex rules of the chamber. While Congress typically follows the advice of its parliamentarians, it is not obligated to, and the parliamentarian has no power to enforce their own interpretation of the rules. Once a committee has been selected, the committee chair is empowered to move the bill through the committee process as they see fit. This occasionally means the chair will refer the bill to one of the committee’s subcommittees.

[.my2]
然而，一旦法案提案提出，多数党领袖便会咨询议事员， 决定将其提交给哪个委员会。每个议院都有一名议事员 ，作为顾问，通常是受过专业训练的律师，负责研究本议院冗长而复杂的规则。虽然国会通常会采纳议事员的建议，但并非必须如此，议事员也无权强制执行其对规则的个人解释。一旦选定委员会，委员会主席便有权根据自身判断推进法案的委员会审议程序。有时，这意味着主席会将法案提交给委员会的某个小组委员会。

Whether at the full committee level or in one of the subcommittees, the next step is typically to hold a hearing on the bill. If the chair decides to not hold a hearing, this is tantamount to killing the bill in committee. The hearing provides an opportunity for the committee to hear and evaluate expert opinions on the bill or aspects of it. Experts typically include officials from the agency that would be responsible for executing the bill, the bill’s sponsors from Congress, and industry lobbyists, interest groups, and academic experts from a variety of relevant fields. Typically, the committee will also accept written statements from the public concerning the bill in question. For many bills, the hearing process can be very routine and straightforward.

[.my2]
无论是在全体委员会层面还是在某个小组委员会层面，下一步通常都是就法案举行听证会。如果主席决定不举行听证会，就相当于在委员会层面否决了该法案。听证会为委员会提供了一个机会，听取并评估专家对法案或其某些方面的意见。专家通常包括负责执行该法案的机构官员、法案在国会的发起人、行业游说者、利益集团以及来自各个相关领域的学术专家。通常，委员会还会接受公众就相关法案提交的书面意见。对于许多法案而言，听证程序可能非常常规且直接。

Once hearings have been completed, the bill enters the markup stage. This is essentially an amending and voting process. In the end, with or without amendments, the committee or subcommittee will vote. If the committee decides not to advance the bill at that time, it is tabled. Tabling a bill typically means the bill is dead, but there is still an option to bring it back up for a vote again. If the committee decides to advance the bill, however, it is printed and goes to the chamber, either the House or the Senate. For the sake of example, we will assume that a bill goes first to the House (although the reverse could be true, and, in fact, bills can move simultaneously through both chambers). Before it reaches the House floor, it must first go through the House Committee on Rules. This committee establishes the rules of debate, such as time limits and limits on the number and type of amendments. After these rules have been established, the bill moves through the floor, where it is debated and amendments can be added. Once the limits of debate and amendments have been reached, the House holds a vote. If a simple majority, 50 percent plus 1, votes to advance the bill, it moves out of the House and into the Senate.

[.my2]
听证会结束后，法案进入审议阶段。这本质上是一个修改和投票的过程。最终，无论是否经过修改，委员会或小组委员会都会进行投票。如果委员会当时决定不推进该法案，则将其搁置。 搁置法案通常意味着该法案已失效，但仍有机会再次提交投票。如果委员会决定推进该法案，则法案将被打印并提交至议院，即众议院或参议院。为了便于说明，我们假设法案首先提交至众议院（尽管情况可能相反，事实上，法案可以同时在两院进行审议）。在提交众议院全体会议之前，法案必须先经过众议院规则委员会的审查。该委员会负责制定辩论规则，例如时间限制以及对修正案的数量和类型的限制。规则制定完成后，法案即可提交众议院全体会议进行辩论，并可提出修正案。当辩论和修正案的次数达到上限后，众议院将进行投票。如果获得简单多数（50%加 1 票）通过该法案，它就会从众议院提交参议院。

Once in the Senate, the bill is placed on the calendar so it can be debated. Or, more typically, the Senate will also consider the bill (or a companion version) in its own committees. Since the Senate is much smaller than the House, it can afford to be much more flexible in its rules for debate. Typically, senators allow each other to talk and debate as long as the speaker wants, though they can agree as a body to create time limits. But without these limits, debate continues until a motion to table has been offered and voted on.

[.my2]
法案一旦进入参议院，就会被列入议程进行辩论。或者更常见的情况是，参议院也会在其各自的委员会中审议该法案（或其对应版本）。由于参议院的规模远小于众议院，因此在辩论规则方面可以更加灵活。通常情况下，参议员们会允许彼此发言和辩论，只要议长愿意，但参议员们也可以集体同意设定时间限制。如果没有这些限制，辩论将持续进行，直到有人提出搁置动议并进行表决为止。

This flexibility about speaking in the Senate gave rise to a unique tactic, the filibuster. The word “filibuster” comes from the Dutch word vrijbuiter, which means pirate. And the name is appropriate, since it was historically the practice that a senator who launches a filibuster virtually hijacks the floor of the chamber by speaking for long periods of time, thus preventing the Senate from closing debate and acting on a bill. The tactic was perfected in the 1850s as Congress wrestled with the complicated issue of slavery. After the Civil War, the use of the filibuster became even more common. Eventually, in 1917, the Senate passed Rule 22, which allowed the chamber to hold a cloture vote to end debate. To invoke cloture, the Senate had to get a two-thirds majority. This was difficult to do, but it generally did prevent anyone from hijacking the Senate floor, with the salient exception of Senator Strom Thurmond’s record twenty-four-hour filibuster of the Civil Rights Act. The classic approach still occasionally occurs, such as when Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) executed a filibuster in 2013 on legislation related to the Affordable Care Act, which included reading the Dr. Seuss children's classic, Green Eggs and Ham.37 However, the vast majority of the time, the actual filibuster action is not needed since floor leaders rarely bring bills to the floor that don't meet the cloture threshold.

[.my2]
参议院发言的这种灵活性催生了一种独特的策略—— 阻挠议事 。 “阻挠议事”（filibuster）一词源于荷兰语 “vrijbuiter ”，意为海盗。这个名字非常贴切，因为历史上，发起阻挠议事的参议员实际上是通过长时间发言来“劫持”议事厅，从而阻止参议院结束辩论并对法案进行表决。这一策略在 19 世纪 50 年代国会处理奴隶制这一复杂问题时得到了完善。内战结束后，阻挠议事的使用变得更加普遍。最终，在 1917 年，参议院通过了第 22 条规则，允许参议院进行终止辩论的投票。要启动终止辩论的投票程序，参议院必须获得三分之二的多数票。这虽然难以做到，但通常确实能阻止任何人劫持参议院议事厅，不过斯特罗姆·瑟蒙德参议员对《 民权法案》 长达 24 小时的阻挠议事是个例外。这种经典做法偶尔还会出现，例如 2013 年，德克萨斯州共和党参议员特德·克鲁兹就《平价医疗法案》相关立法进行阻挠议事，期间他还朗读了苏斯博士的儿童经典绘本 《绿鸡蛋和火腿 》。 37 然而，绝大多数情况下，实际的阻挠议事行为是不必要的，因为议事厅领袖很少会将不符合终止辩论门槛的法案提交到参议院。

In 1975, after the heightened partisanship of the civil rights era, the Senate further weakened the filibuster by reducing the number needed for cloture from two-thirds to three-fifths, or sixty votes, where it remains today (except for judicial nominations for which only fifty-one votes are needed to invoke cloture). Moreover, filibusters are not permitted on the annual budget reconciliation act. In this way, the Reconciliation Act of 2010 was how the implementing legislation for Obamacare was passed. The budget reconciliation process was also used by Republicans to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and by Democrats to pass the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which contained a massive COVID relief package.

[.my2]
1975 年，在民权运动时期党派斗争加剧之后，参议院进一步削弱了阻挠议事规则，将终止辩论所需的票数从三分之二降至五分之三，即六十票，这一比例沿用至今（司法提名除外，司法提名只需五十一票即可终止辩论）。此外，年度预算协调法案不允许进行阻挠议事。2010 年的预算协调法案正是通过这种方式通过的，该法案包含了奥巴马医改的实施细则。共和党人也利用预算协调程序通过了 2017 年的《减税与就业法案》，而民主党人则通过了 2021 年的《美国救援计划法案》，该法案包含了一项大规模的新冠疫情救助方案。

Milestone  里程碑
The Noble History of the Filibuster?
阻挠议事的崇高历史？
When most people think of the Senate filibuster, they probably picture actor Jimmy Stewart standing exasperated at a podium and demanding the Senate come to its senses and do the right thing. Even for those not familiar with the classic Frank Capra film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, the image of a heroic single senator sanding up to the power of the entire chamber while armed only with oratorical skill naturally tends to inspire. Unfortunately, the history of the filibuster is less heartwarming.

[.my2]
大多数人想到参议院的阻挠议事，脑海中浮现的可能是演员吉米·斯图尔特站在讲台上，义愤填膺地要求参议院清醒过来，做出正确的决定。即使是不熟悉弗兰克·卡普拉经典电影《 史密斯先生到华盛顿》的人，也会被这位英勇的参议员仅凭雄辩的口才就挑战整个参议院的权威这一形象所鼓舞。然而，阻挠议事的历史却远没有那么令人振奋。

This is not to say that noble causes haven’t been championed by filibustering senators; they most certainly have. But they have largely been overshadowed by the outright ridiculous and sometimes racist filibusters of the twentieth century. In the first category, the fifteen-and-a-half-hour marathon of Senator Huey Long of Louisiana stands out: Hoping to retain the need for Senate confirmation of some jobs he wanted to keep from his political enemies, Long spent much of his filibuster analyzing the Constitution, talking about his favorite recipes, and telling amusing stories, as was his custom.

错误原因

In a defining moment for the filibuster, Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina spoke for twenty-four hours and eighteen minutes against a weak civil rights bill in 1957. A vocal proponent of segregation and White supremacy, Thurmond had made no secret of his views and had earlier run for the presidency on a segregationist platform. Nor was Thurmond the first to use the filibuster to preserve segregation and prevent the expansion of civil rights for African Americans. Groups of dedicated southern senators used the filibuster to prevent the passage of anti-lynching legislation on multiple occasions during the first half of the twentieth century. Later, when faced with the 1964 Civil Rights Act, southern senators staged a fifty-seven-day filibuster to try and kill it. But the momentum of the nation was against them. The bill passed over their obstructionism and helped to reduce segregation.

[.my2]
在阻挠议事规则发展史上的一个关键时刻，南卡罗来纳州参议员斯特罗姆· 瑟蒙德于 1957 年进行了长达 24 小时 18 分钟的阻挠议事，反对一项力度不足的民权法案。瑟蒙德是种族隔离和白人至上主义的坚定拥护者，他毫不掩饰自己的观点，此前他曾以种族隔离主义纲领竞选总统。瑟蒙德并非第一个利用阻挠议事规则来维护种族隔离、阻止非裔美国人民权扩展的人。在 20 世纪上半叶，一些忠诚的南方参议员曾多次利用阻挠议事规则阻止反私刑法案的通过。后来，面对 1964 年的《民权法案》，南方参议员又发起了一场长达 57 天的阻挠议事，试图扼杀该法案。但全国的民意与他们的阻挠背道而驰。该法案最终克服了他们的阻挠获得通过，并有助于减少种族隔离。

Is the filibuster the tool of the noble minority attempting to hold back the tide of a powerful minority? Or does its history as a weapon supporting segregation expose it as merely a tactic of obstruction?
冗长辩论是高尚的少数人试图阻止强大的少数人浪潮的工具吗？还是说，它作为支持种族隔离的武器的历史表明，它仅仅是一种阻挠策略？

Because both the House and the Senate can and often do amend bills, the bills that pass out of each chamber frequently look different. This presents a problem, since the Constitution requires that both chambers pass identical bills. One simple solution is for the first chamber to simply accept the bill that ultimately makes it out of the second chamber. Another solution is for first chamber to further amend the second chamber’s bill and send it back to the second chamber. Congress typically takes one of these two options, but about one in every eight bills cannot be resolved in this way. These bills must be sent to a conference committee that negotiates a reconciliation both chambers can accept without amendment. Only then can the bill progress to the president’s desk for signature or veto. If the president does veto the bill, both chambers must muster a two-thirds vote to overcome the veto and make the bill law without presidential approval (Figure 11.20).

[.my2]
由于众议院和参议院都可以而且经常修改法案，因此两院通过的法案往往各不相同。这就带来了一个问题，因为宪法要求两院通过的法案必须完全相同。一个简单的解决方案是，众议院直接接受最终由参议院通过的法案。另一个解决方案是，众议院对参议院通过的法案进行进一步修改，然后将其送回参议院。国会通常会选择这两种方案之一，但大约八分之一的法案无法通过这种方式解决。这些法案必须提交给联席会议委员会，由该委员会协商达成一项两院都能接受且无需修改的协议。只有这样，法案才能提交给总统签署或否决。如果总统否决了法案，两院必须获得三分之二的多数票才能推翻总统的否决，使法案在未经总统批准的情况下成为法律（ 图 11.20 ）。

MODERN LEGISLATION IS DIFFERENT
现代立法有所不同
For much of the nation’s history, the process described above was the standard method by which a bill became a law. Over the course of the last three and a half decades, however, changes in rules and procedure have created a number of alternate routes. Collectively, these different routes constitute what some political scientists have described as a new but unorthodox legislative process. According to political scientist Barbara Sinclair, the primary trigger for the shift away from the classic legislative route was the budget reforms of the 1970s. The 1974 Budget and Impoundment Control Act gave Congress a mechanism for making large, all-encompassing, budget decisions. In the years that followed, the budget process gradually became the vehicle for creating comprehensive policy changes. One large step in this transformation occurred in 1981 when President Ronald Reagan’s administration suggested using the budget to push through his economic reforms.

[.my2]
在国家历史的大部分时期，上述流程是法案成为法律的标准方法。然而，在过去三十五年中，规则和程序的变化催生了多种替代途径。这些不同的途径共同构成了一些政治学家所描述的一种新的、非正统的立法程序。政治学家芭芭拉·辛克莱尔认为，促使立法程序偏离传统路径的主要因素是 20 世纪 70 年代的预算改革。1974 年的 《预算和扣押控制法》 赋予国会制定大型、全面预算决策的机制。在随后的几年里，预算程序逐渐成为制定全面政策变革的工具。这一转变的一个重要里程碑发生在 1981 年，当时罗纳德·里根总统的政府提议利用预算来推进其经济改革。

The benefit of attaching the reforms to the budget resolution was that Congress could force an up or down (yea or nay) vote on the whole package. Such a packaged bill is called an omnibus bill.38 Creating and voting for an omnibus bill allows Congress to quickly accomplish policy changes that would have taken many votes and the expending of great political capital over a long period of time. This and successive similar uses of the budget process convinced many in Congress of the utility of this strategy. During the contentious and ideologically divided 1990s, the budget process became the common problem-solving mechanism in the legislature, thus laying the groundwork for the way legislation works today.

[.my2]
将改革措施附加到预算决议中的好处在于，国会可以强制对整个方案进行表决。这种打包法案被称为综合法案 。 38 制定和表决综合法案使国会能够迅速完成政策变革，而这些变革如果通过，则需要多次投票，耗费大量政治资本，且耗时较长。这一举措以及随后类似的预算程序运用，使国会中的许多人确信了这一策略的有效性。在充满争议且意识形态分裂的 20 世纪 90 年代，预算程序成为立法机构普遍采用的问题解决机制，从而为当今的立法运作方式奠定了基础。

An important characteristic feature of modern legislating is the greatly expanded power and influence of the party leadership over the control of bills. One reason for this change was the heightened partisanship that stretches back to the 1980s and is still with us today. With such high political stakes, the party leadership is reluctant to simply allow the committees to work things out on their own. In the House, the leadership uses special rules to guide bills through the legislative process and toward a particular outcome. Uncommon just a few decades ago, these now widely used rules restrict debate and options, and are designed to focus the attention of members.

[.my2]
现代立法的一个重要特征是政党领导层对法案的控制权和影响力大幅增强。造成这种变化的原因之一是自20世纪80年代以来日益加剧的党派之争，这种现象至今仍然存在。由于政治利益如此重大，政党领导层不愿放任各委员会自行解决问题。在众议院，领导层利用特殊规则来引导法案通过立法程序，并最终达成特定结果。这些规则在几十年前还不常见，如今却被广泛使用，它们限制了辩论和选择，旨在集中议员的注意力。

The practice of multiple referrals, with which entire bills or portions of those bills are referred to more than one committee, greatly weakened the different specialization monopolies committees held primarily in the House but also to an extent in the Senate. With less control over the bills, committees naturally reached out to the leadership for assistance. Indeed, as a testament to its increasing control, the leadership may sometimes avoid committees altogether, preferring to work things out on the floor. And even when bills move through the committees, the leadership often seeks to adjust the legislation before it reaches the floor.

[.my2]
多重提交的做法，即将整项法案或其部分内容提交给多个委员会，极大地削弱了各委员会（主要是众议院，但也在一定程度上影响了参议院）各自拥有的专业垄断地位。由于对法案的控制力减弱，各委员会自然而然地向领导层寻求帮助。事实上，为了体现其日益增强的控制力，领导层有时甚至会完全绕过委员会，而更倾向于在全体会议上解决问题。即使法案通过了委员会的审议，领导层也常常会在法案提交全体会议之前对其进行修改。

Another feature of the modern legislative process, exclusively in the Senate, is the application of the modern filibuster. Unlike the traditional filibuster, in which a senator took the floor and held it for as long as possible, the modern filibuster is actually a perversion of the cloture rules adopted to control the filibuster. When partisanship is high, as it has been frequently, the senators can request cloture before any bill can get a vote. This has the effect of increasing the number of votes needed for a bill to advance from a simple majority of fifty-one to a super majority of sixty. The effect is to give the Senate minority great power to obstruct if it is inclined to do so.

[.my2]
现代立法程序中另一个独特的特点，尤其体现在参议院，是现代阻挠议事规则的运用。与传统的阻挠议事（即参议员尽可能长时间地占用发言权）不同，现代阻挠议事实际上是对旨在控制阻挠议事的终止辩论规则的一种曲解。当党派之争激烈时（这种情况屡见不鲜），参议员可以在任何法案进行表决之前要求终止辩论。这使得法案通过所需的票数从简单的51票增加到绝对多数60票。其结果是赋予参议院少数党极大的阻挠权力。
