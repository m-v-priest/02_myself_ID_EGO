== 释义

The U.S Constitution and its founding principles of liberty, equality, and justice are admired and emulated the world over. However, not everyone living in the U.S. has enjoyed the same treatment and freedoms the law promises. When we consider the experiences of women, immigrants, people of color, LGBTQ people, people with disabilities, and other groups, a majority of Americans have been deprived of basic rights and opportunities, and sometimes of citizenship itself. This idea of America is, indeed, a work in progress.

美国宪法及其自由、平等和正义的立国原则为世人所敬仰和效仿。然而，并非所有生活在美国的人都能享有法律所承诺的同等待遇和自由。当我们审视女性、移民、有色人种、LGBTQ 群体、残疾人士以及其他群体的经历时，就会发现大多数美国人被剥夺了基本权利和机会，有时甚至被剥夺了公民权。事实上，美国的理念仍在不断完善之中。

The struggle for civil rights is a story of courageous individuals and social movements awakening fellow Americans, compelling lawmakers, and inspiring the courts to make good on these founding promises. While many changes must still be made, the past one hundred years have seen remarkable progress. Yet, as the rash of thinly-veiled voter suppression bills making their way through state legislatures demonstrate, (Figure 5.1), members of these groups still encounter prejudice, discrimination, and even exclusion from civic life.

争取民权的斗争是一部充满勇气的个人和社会运动唤醒美国同胞、敦促立法者、并激励法院履行建国承诺的历史。尽管仍有许多变革亟待完成，但过去一百年来的成就斐然。然而，正如近期各州议会正在审议的一系列隐晦的选民压制法案所表明的那样（ 图 5.1 ），这些群体成员仍然面临着偏见、歧视，甚至被排除在公民生活之外。

What is the difference between civil liberties and civil rights? How did the African American struggle for civil rights evolve? What challenges did women overcome in securing the right to vote, and what obstacles do they and other U.S. groups still face? This chapter addresses these and other questions in exploring the essential concepts of civil rights.

Figure 5.1 On August 6, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson meets with Atlanta native Martin Luther King, Jr. at the signing of the Voting Rights Act (left). Access to polling places, early voting, mail-in voting, and other considerations all have significant implications on voters rights, and any barriers can deeply influence elections. On the right side of the image, the 2024 Georgia election map shows the sharp differences in voting by location, with urban areas voting for Democratic candidates and the rest of the state voting largely Republican.
