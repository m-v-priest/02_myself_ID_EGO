== 释义



Native Americans have long suffered the effects of segregation and discrimination imposed by the U.S. government and the larger White society. Native Americans were not granted the full rights and protections of U.S. citizenship until long after African Americans and women were, with many having to wait until the Nationality Act of 1940 to become citizens.93 This was long after the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, which granted citizenship to African Americans but not, the Supreme Court decided in Elk v. Wilkins (1884), to Native Americans.94 White women had been citizens of the United States since its very beginning even though they were not granted the full rights of citizenship. Furthermore, Native Americans are the only group of Americans who were forcibly removed en masse from the lands on which they and their ancestors had lived so that others could claim this land and its resources. This issue remains relevant today as can be seen in the recent protests of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which have led to intense confrontations between those in charge of the pipeline and Native Americans.

长期以来，美洲原住民饱受美国政府和白人社会强加的种族隔离和歧视之苦。直到非裔美国人和女性获得公民权很久之后，美洲原住民才被赋予完整的公民权利和保护，许多人甚至要等到 1940 年《国籍法》颁布后才能成为公民。 93 这远晚于 1868 年通过的第十四修正案，该修正案赋予了非裔美国人公民权，但最高法院在 1884 年的 “埃尔克诉威尔金斯案 ”中裁定，美洲原住民不享有公民权。 94 白人女性自美国建国之初就拥有公民权，尽管她们并未被赋予完整的公民权利。此外，美洲原住民是唯一一个被集体强行驱逐出他们及其祖先世代居住的土地，以便他人占有这片土地及其资源的美国群体。这个问题在今天依然具有现实意义，例如最近针对达科他输油管道的抗议活动，就导致了管道管理方与美洲原住民之间的激烈冲突。

NATIVE AMERICANS LOSE THEIR LAND AND THEIR RIGHTS
美洲原住民失去土地和权利
From the very beginning of European settlement in North America, Native Americans were abused and exploited. Early British settlers attempted to enslave the members of various tribes, especially in the southern colonies and states.95 Following the American Revolution, the U.S. government assumed responsibility for conducting negotiations with Indian tribes, all of which were designated as sovereign nations, and regulating commerce with them. Because Native Americans were officially regarded as citizens of other nations, they were denied U.S. citizenship.96
自欧洲人在北美定居之初，美洲原住民就遭受虐待和剥削。早期的英国殖民者试图奴役各个部落的成员，尤其是在南部殖民地和各州。95 美国独立战争后，美国政府承担起与印第安部落进行谈判的责任，所有部落都被认定为主权国家，并负责管理与他们的贸易。由于美洲原住民在官方上被视为其他国家的公民，他们被剥夺了美国公民身份 。96

As White settlement spread westward over the course of the nineteenth century, Indian tribes were forced to move from their homelands. Although the federal government signed numerous treaties guaranteeing tribe members the right to live in the places where they had traditionally farmed, hunted, or fished, land-hungry White settlers routinely violated these agreements and the federal government did little to enforce them.97
随着 19 世纪白人定居点向西扩张，印第安部落被迫离开家园。尽管联邦政府签署了许多条约，保障部落成员有权居住在他们传统耕作、狩猎或捕鱼的地方，但贪婪的白人定居者却经常违反这些协议，而联邦政府也鲜少执行 。97

In 1830, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, which forced Native Americans to move west of the Mississippi River.98 Not all tribes were willing to leave their land, however. The Cherokee in particular resisted, and in the 1820s, the state of Georgia tried numerous tactics to force them from their territory. Efforts intensified in 1829 after gold was discovered there. Wishing to remain where they were, the tribe sued the state of Georgia.99 In 1831, the Supreme Court decided in Cherokee Nation v. Georgia that Indian tribes were not sovereign nations, but also that tribes were entitled to their ancestral lands and could not be forced to move from them.100
1830 年，国会通过了《 印第安人迁移法案》 ，强迫美洲原住民迁往密西西比河以西。98 然而 ，并非所有部落都愿意离开他们的土地。尤其是切罗基部落，他们进行了抵抗。19 世纪 20 年代，佐治亚州尝试了多种手段迫使他们离开自己的领土。1829 年，当地发现金矿后，驱逐行动进一步加剧。切罗基部落希望留在原地，于是起诉了佐治亚州。99 1831 年，最高法院在 “切罗基民族诉佐治亚州案 ”中裁定，印第安部落并非主权国家，但同时又裁定部落有权拥有其祖先土地，不得被强迫迁离 。100

The next year, in Worcester v. Georgia, the Court ruled that non-Native Americans could not enter tribal lands without the tribe’s permission. White Georgians, however, refused to abide by the Court’s decision, and President Andrew Jackson, who had fought in conflicts against Native Americans, refused to enforce it.101 Between 1831 and 1838, members of several southern tribes, including the Cherokees, were forced by the U.S. Army to move west along routes shown in Figure 5.15. The forced removal of the Cherokees to Oklahoma Territory, which had been set aside for settlement by displaced tribes and designated Indian Territory, resulted in the death of one-quarter of the tribe’s population.102 The Cherokees remember this journey as the Trail of Tears.

次年，在 “伍斯特诉佐治亚州案” 中，最高法院裁定，未经部落许可，非美洲原住民不得进入部落领地。然而，佐治亚州的白人拒绝遵守法院的裁决，而曾与美洲原住民交战的安德鲁· 杰克逊总统也拒绝执行该裁决。 101 1831 年至 1838 年间，包括切罗基人在内的几个南方部落的成员被迫沿图 5.15 所示的路线向西迁徙。切罗基人被强行迁往俄克拉荷马领地（该领地被划拨给流离失所的部落定居，并被指定为印第安领地），导致该部落四分之一的人口死亡。 102 切罗基人将这段旅程称为 “血泪之路” 。

By the time of the Civil War, most Indian tribes had been relocated west of the Mississippi. However, once large numbers of White Americans and European immigrants had also moved west after the Civil War, Native Americans once again found themselves displaced. They were confined to reservations, which are federal lands set aside for their use where non-Indians could not settle. Reservation land was usually poor, however, and attempts to farm or raise livestock, not traditional occupations for most western tribes anyway, often ended in failure. Unable to feed themselves, the tribes became dependent on the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in Washington, DC, for support. Protestant missionaries were allowed to “adopt” various tribes, to convert them to Christianity and thus speed their assimilation. In an effort to hasten this process, Native American children were taken from their parents and sent to boarding schools, many of them run by churches, where they were forced to speak English and abandon their traditional cultures.103
内战时期，大多数印第安部落已被迁往密西西比河以西。然而，内战结束后，随着大量白人和欧洲移民也向西迁徙，印第安人再次流离失所。他们被限制在保留地内，这些联邦土地是专门划给他们使用的，非印第安人不得在此定居。然而，保留地的土地通常贫瘠，而耕种或畜牧——这些本来就不是大多数西部部落的传统职业——往往以失败告终。由于无法自给自足，这些部落不得不依赖位于华盛顿特区的印第安事务局 （BIA）的援助。新教传教士被允许“收养”各个部落，使他们皈依基督教，从而加速他们的同化进程。为了加快这一进程，印第安儿童被从父母身边带走，送往寄宿学校，其中许多学校由教会开办，在那里他们被迫说英语，放弃他们的传统文化。 103

In 1887, the Dawes Severalty Act, another effort to assimilate Native Americans to White society, divided reservation lands into individual allotments. Native Americans who accepted these allotments and agreed to sever tribal ties were also given U.S. citizenship. All lands remaining after the division of reservations into allotments were offered for sale by the federal government to White farmers and ranchers. As a result, Native Americans swiftly lost control of reservation land.104 In 1898, the Curtis Act dealt the final blow to Indian sovereignty by abolishing all tribal governments.105
1887 年，《 道斯分割法案》（Dawes Severalty Act） ——又一项旨在将美洲原住民同化到白人社会的举措——将保留地分割成个人地块。接受这些地块并同意断绝部落关系的美洲原住民也被授予美国公民身份。保留地分割后剩余的所有土地均由联邦政府出售给白人农场主和牧场主。结果，美洲原住民迅速失去了对保留地的控制权。 104 1898 年，《 柯蒂斯法案》（Curtis Act） 废除了所有部落政府，彻底摧毁了印第安人的主权。 105

THE FIGHT FOR NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS
争取美洲原住民权利的斗争
As Native Americans were removed from their tribal lands and increasingly saw their traditional cultures being destroyed over the course of the nineteenth century, a movement to protect their rights began to grow. Sarah Winnemucca (Figure 5.16), member of the Paiute tribe, lectured throughout the east in the 1880s in order to acquaint White audiences with the injustices suffered by the western tribes.106 Lakota physician Charles Eastman (Figure 5.16) also worked for Native American rights. In 1924, the Indian Citizenship Act granted citizenship to all Native Americans born after its passage. Native Americans born before the act took effect, who had not already become citizens as a result of the Dawes Severalty Act or service in the army in World War I, had to wait until the Nationality Act of 1940 to become citizens. In 1934, Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act, which ended the division of reservation land into allotments. It returned to Native American tribes the right to institute self-government on their reservations, write constitutions, and manage their remaining lands and resources. It also provided funds for Native Americans to start their own businesses and attain a college education.107
随着 19 世纪印第安人被迫离开部落土地，他们的传统文化日益遭到破坏，一场保护他们权利的运动开始兴起。派尤特族成员莎拉 ·温尼穆卡 （ 图 5.16 ）在 19 世纪 80 年代奔走于美国东部各地，向白人听众讲述西部部落遭受的不公正待遇。拉科塔族医生查尔斯· 伊斯特曼 （ 图 5.16 ）也致力于维护印第安人的权利。1924 年，《 印第安人公民权法案》 赋予所有在该法案通过后出生的印第安人公民权。在该法案生效前出生的印第安人，如果尚未因《道斯分割法案》或在第一次世界大战中服役而获得公民权，则必须等到 1940 年《 国籍法案》 通过后才能获得公民权。1934 年，国会通过了《 印第安人重组法案》 ，终止了将保留地分割成小块的做法。它恢复了美洲原住民部落在其保留地内建​​立自治、制定宪法以及管理其剩余土地和资源的权利。它还为美洲原住民提供了资金，帮助他们创办自己的企业和接受高等教育 。107

Despite the Indian Reorganization Act, conditions on the reservations did not improve dramatically. Most tribes remained impoverished, and many Native Americans, despite the fact that they were now U.S. citizens, were denied the right to vote by the states in which they lived. States justified this violation of the Fifteenth Amendment by claiming that Native Americans might be U.S. citizens but were not state residents because they lived on reservations. Other states denied Native Americans voting rights if they did not pay taxes.108 Despite states’ actions, the federal government continued to uphold the rights of tribes to govern themselves. Federal concern for tribal sovereignty was part of an effort on the government’s part to end its control of, and obligations to, Indian tribes.109
尽管有《印第安人重组法案》，保留地的状况并未得到显著改善。大多数部落依然贫困，许多美洲原住民虽然已成为美国公民，却被他们居住的州剥夺了投票权。各州辩称，美洲原住民虽然是美国公民，但由于居住在保留地，因此不属于该州居民，以此为这种违反第十五修正案的行为辩护。其他一些州则以美洲原住民不纳税为由，剥夺他们的投票权。 108 尽管各州采取了这些行动，联邦政府仍然坚持维护部落的自治权。联邦政府对部落主权的关注，是其结束对印第安部落的控制和义务的举措之一。 109

In the 1960s, a modern Native American civil rights movement, inspired by the African American civil rights movement, began to grow. In 1969, a group of Native American activists from various tribes, part of a new Pan-Indian movement, took control of Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay, which had once been the site of a federal prison. Attempting to strike a blow for Red Power, a multi-faceted movement to increase the power of Native Americans united by a Pan-Indian identity and demanding federal recognition of their rights, they maintained control of the island for more than a year and a half. They claimed the land as compensation for the federal government’s violation of numerous treaties and offered to pay for it with beads and trinkets. In January 1970, some of the occupiers began to leave the island. Some may have been disheartened by the accidental death of the daughter of one of the activists. In May 1970, all electricity and telephone service to the island was cut off by the federal government, and more of the occupiers began to leave. Over the course of the next year, the conditions on the island declined steadily and public opinion in the country turned decidedly against the occupiers. By June 1971, the few people remaining on the island were removed by the government. Though the goals of the activists were not achieved, the occupation of Alcatraz had brought national attention to the concerns of Native American activists.110
20 世纪 60 年代，受非裔美国人民权运动的启发，一场现代的美国原住民民权运动开始兴起。1969 年，一群来自不同部落的原住民活动家，作为新兴泛印第安运动的一部分，占领了旧金山湾的阿尔卡特拉斯岛。该岛曾是联邦监狱的所在地。他们试图以此为“红色力量”（Red Power）运动发声。“红色力量”是一项旨在增强以泛印第安身份认同为纽带的原住民力量，并要求联邦政府承认其权利的多方面运动。他们占领该岛长达一年半之久。他们声称，联邦政府违反多项条约，应以此作为对土地的补偿，并提出用珠子和小饰品支付。1970 年 1 月，部分占领者开始离开该岛。或许是因为其中一位活动家的女儿意外身亡，才导致一些人意志消沉。 1970 年 5 月，联邦政府切断了岛上所有的电力和电话服务，越来越多的占领者开始离开。在接下来的一年里，岛上的状况持续恶化，全国舆论也明显转向反对占领者 。 到 1971 年 6 月，岛上剩余的少数人也被政府驱逐。尽管活动人士的目标并未实现，但占领阿尔卡特拉斯岛的行动使美国原住民活动人士的诉求引起了全国的关注。

In 1973, members of the American Indian Movement (AIM), a more radical group than the occupiers of Alcatraz, temporarily took over the offices of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington, DC. The following year, members of AIM and some two hundred Oglala Lakota supporters occupied the town of Wounded Knee on the Lakota tribe’s Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, the site of an 1890 massacre of Lakota men, women, and children by the U.S. Army (Figure 5.17). Many of the Oglala were protesting the actions of their half-White tribal chieftain, who they claimed had worked too closely with the BIA. The occupiers also wished to protest the failure of the Justice Department to investigate acts of White violence against Lakota tribal members outside the bounds of the reservation.

[.my2]
1973 年，比占领阿尔卡特拉斯岛的激进组织“ 美国印第安人运动 ”（AIM） 的成员暂时占领了位于华盛顿特区的美国印第安事务局（BIA）办公室。次年，AIM 成员和约 200 名奥格拉拉·拉科塔族（Oglala Lakota）的支持者占领了位于南达科他州松树岭保留地的伤膝镇（Wounded Knee）。1890 年，美国陆军在此对拉科塔族男女老幼进行了大屠杀（ 图 5.17 ）。许多奥格拉拉族人抗议他们拥有白人血统的部落酋长的行为，他们声称酋长与 BIA 关系过于密切。占领者还希望抗议司法部未能调查白人在保留地之外对拉科塔族成员实施的暴力行为。

The occupation led to a confrontation between the Native American protestors and the FBI and U.S. Marshals. Violence erupted; two Native American activists were killed, and a marshal was shot (Figure 5.17). After the second death, the Lakota called for an end to the occupation and negotiations began with the federal government. Two of AIM’s leaders, Russell Means and Dennis Banks, were arrested, but the case against them was later dismissed.111 Violence continued on the Pine Ridge Reservation for several years after the siege; the reservation had the highest per capita murder rate in the United States. Two FBI agents were among those who were killed. The Oglala blamed the continuing violence on the federal government.112
这次占领行动导致美洲原住民抗议者与联邦调查局和美国法警发生冲突。暴力事件爆发，两名美洲原住民活动人士被杀，一名法警中枪（ 图 5.17 ）。第二名活动人士死亡后，拉科塔人呼吁结束占领行动，并开始与联邦政府进行谈判。美国印第安人运动（AIM）的两名领导人拉塞尔·米恩斯和丹尼斯·班克斯被捕，但后来对他们的指控被撤销。 111 围攻结束后，松树岭保留地的暴力事件持续了数年；该保留地的人均谋杀率位居全美最高。两名联邦调查局特工也在遇害者之列。奥格拉拉人将持续不断的暴力事件归咎于联邦政府。 112

The current relationship between the U.S. government and Native American tribes was established by the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975. Under the act, tribes assumed control of programs that had formerly been controlled by the BIA, such as education and resource management, and the federal government provided the funding.113 Many tribes have also used their new freedom from government control to legalize gambling and to open casinos on their reservations. Although the states in which these casinos are located have attempted to control gaming on Native American lands, the Supreme Court and the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 have limited their ability to do so.114 The 1978 American Indian Religious Freedom Act granted tribes the right to conduct traditional ceremonies and rituals, including those that use otherwise prohibited substances like peyote cactus and eagle bones, which can be procured only from vulnerable or protected species.115 Another 1978 law, the Indian Child Welfare Act, prevented the frequent practice of removing Native American children from their homes and placing them non-Native American families. The law stated that if a child needed to be removed from their family for reasons of welfare and safety, they would be either placed with extended family, members of their own tribe, or members of another tribe—not with non-Native American families. (The law has been challenged, but in 2023 the Supreme Court ruled that it should remain intact.)116
美国政府与美洲原住民部落之间的现有关系由 1975 年的 《印第安人自决与教育援助法案》 确立。根据该法案，部落接管了此前由印第安事务局（BIA）管理的项目，例如教育和资源管理，而联邦政府则提供资金。 113 许多部落还利用摆脱政府控制的新自由，将赌博合法化，并在其保留地开设赌场。尽管这些赌场所在的州试图控制美洲原住民土地上的博彩活动，但最高法院和 1988 年的《 印第安博彩监管法案》 限制了它们这样做的能力。 114 1978 年的《美国印第安人宗教自由法案》 赋予部落举行传统仪式和祭祀的权利，包括使用一些通常被禁止的物质，例如佩奥特仙人掌和鹰骨，这些物质只能从易受伤害或受保护的物种身上获得。 115 另一项 1978 年的法律——《印第安儿童福利法》——阻止了将美洲原住民儿童从家中带走并安置在非美洲原住民家庭的频繁做法。该法规定，如果出于福利和安全原因需要将儿童从家庭中带走，他们将被安置在亲戚家中、本部落成员家中或其他部落成员家中——而不是非美洲原住民家庭中。（该法曾受到挑战，但最高法院于 2023 年裁定其应继续有效。） 116

In another important recent development, several federal court cases have raised standing for Native American tribes to sue to regain former reservation lands lost to the U.S. government. Through a key 5-4 decision by the Supreme Court in McGirt v. Oklahoma, Native Americans realized the most important advancement in rights since the reapplication of the Winters Doctrine (which led to a stronger footing for tribes in water negotiations). 117 The initial case taken up by the Court in 2019, Carpenter v. Murphy, which revolved around a murder case in Oklahoma, became quite salient, given the history of the Trail of Tears. At issue was whether Mr. Murphy committed murder on private land in the state of Oklahoma or on the Muscogee (Creek) reservation and who should have jurisdiction over his case. If the court decided to proclaim the land as a reservation, that would potentially lead to half the State of Oklahoma being designated as such.118 After hearing arguments in late 2018, they did not hand down a decision in 2019. However, in the follow-up case, McGirt v. Oklahoma, the Court took the step that strengthened Native American rights. The landmark decision held that a large part of Oklahoma is tribal land. Moreover, the court argued that crimes committed on those lands are subject to federal, not state authority. In this case, Jimcy McGirt was convicted in Oklahoma state court in 1997 of various sexual crimes. McGirt challenged the conviction on the basis that Oklahoma lacked jurisdiction to prosecute a member of the Muscogee Creek Nation tribe for crimes committed on tribal land.119
在近期另一项重要进展中，几起联邦法院案件提升了美洲原住民部落提起诉讼以收回被美国政府夺走的原保留地的诉讼资格。最高法院在 “麦克吉尔特诉俄克拉荷马州案”（McGirt v. Oklahoma） 中以 5 比 4 的关键性裁决，使美洲原住民的权利取得了自“温特斯原则”（Winters Doctrine）重新适用以来最重要的进展（该原则赋予部落在水资源谈判中更强大的地位）。 117 最高法院于 2019 年受理的首例案件“卡彭特诉墨菲案 ”（Carpenter v. Murphy ）围绕俄克拉荷马州的一起谋杀案展开，鉴于“血泪之路”的历史背景，该案显得尤为引人注目。争议焦点在于，墨菲先生是在俄克拉荷马州的私人土地上还是在马斯科吉（克里克）保留地上犯下谋杀罪，以及谁应该对此案拥有管辖权。如果法院裁定该土地为保留地，则可能导致俄克拉荷马州一半的土地被划为保留地。 118 在 2018 年末听取辩论后，最高法院并未在 2019 年作出裁决。然而，在后续案件“ 麦克吉尔特诉俄克拉荷马州案”（McGirt v. Oklahoma） 中，最高法院采取了加强美国原住民权利的举措。这项具有里程碑意义的裁决认定，俄克拉荷马州的大部分地区属于部落土地。此外，法院还认为，在这些土地上发生的犯罪行为应由联邦而非州政府管辖。在本案中，吉姆西·麦克吉尔特（Jimcy McGirt）于 1997 年在俄克拉荷马州法院被判犯有多项性犯罪。麦克吉尔特对判决提出质疑，理由是俄克拉荷马州无权起诉一名马斯科吉克里克族（Muscogee Creek Nation）成员在部落土地上犯下的罪行 。119

In addition to gains in water rights and land rights, Native American tribes made other gains in recent decades. Tribes have robust and well-recognized governing institutions based on democratic principles. Moreover, many tribes now have governing compacts negotiated with the states where their ancestral lands lay. The proliferation of Indian gaming has further strengthened the success and political influence of the tribes. Finally, the appointment by President Biden, and subsequent Senate confirmation, of Rep. Deb Haaland (D-NM) as Secretary of the Interior was a powerful and pathbreaking moment. She is the first Native American to hold that position at Interior, which includes the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

[.my2]
除了在水权和土地权方面取得的进展外，美洲原住民部落近几十年来还取得了其他方面的成就。部落拥有健全且广受认可的、基于民主原则的治理机构。此外，许多部落现在都与祖地所在的州签订了治理协议。印第安博彩业的蓬勃发展进一步巩固了部落的成功和政治影响力。最后，拜登总统任命黛布·哈兰德（新墨西哥州民主党众议员）为内政部长，并随后获得参议院确认，这是一个意义重大且具有开创性的时刻。她是首位担任内政部长（包括印第安事务局）的美洲原住民。

ALASKA NATIVES AND NATIVE HAWAIIANS REGAIN SOME RIGHTS
阿拉斯加原住民和夏威夷原住民重新获得部分权利
Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians endured many of the same abuses as Native Americans, including loss of land and forced assimilation. Following the discovery of oil in Alaska, however, the state, in an effort to gain undisputed title to oil rich land, settled the issue of Alaska Natives’ land claims with the passage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act in 1971. According to the terms of the act, Alaska Natives received 44 million acres of resource-rich land and more than $900 million in cash in exchange for relinquishing claims to ancestral lands to which the state wanted title.120
阿拉斯加原住民和夏威夷原住民遭受了许多与美洲原住民相同的虐待，包括土地丧失和强制同化。然而，在阿拉斯加发现石油后，为了获得对富油土地的绝对所有权，阿拉斯加州政府于 1971 年通过了《阿拉斯加原住民土地索赔解决法案》， 试图解决阿拉斯加原住民的土地索赔问题。根据该法案的条款，阿拉斯加原住民放弃了对州政府想要占有的祖传土地的索赔，换取了 4400 万英亩资源丰富的土地和超过 9 亿美元的现金。

Native Hawaiians also lost control of their land—nearly two million acres—through the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893 and the subsequent formal annexation of the Hawaiian Islands by the United States in 1898. The indigenous population rapidly decreased in number, and white settlers tried to erase all trace of traditional Hawaiian culture. Two acts passed by Congress in 1900 and 1959, when the territory was granted statehood, returned slightly more than one million acres of federally owned land to the state of Hawaii. The state was to hold it in trust and use profits from the land to improve the condition of Native Hawaiians.121
1893 年夏威夷君主制被推翻，1898 年美国正式吞并夏威夷群岛，夏威夷原住民也失去了对近两百万英亩土地的控制权。原住民人口迅速减少，白人定居者试图抹去所有夏威夷传统文化的痕迹。1900 年和 1959 年，夏威夷领地获得州地位时，国会通过了两项法案，将略多于一百万英亩的联邦土地归还给夏威夷州。夏威夷州应以信托方式持有这些土地，并将土地收益用于改善夏威夷原住民的生活状况。 121

In September 2015, the U.S. Department of Interior, the same department that contains the Bureau of Indian Affairs, created guidelines for Native Hawaiians who wish to govern themselves in a relationship with the federal government similar to that established with Native American and Alaska Native tribes. Such a relationship would grant Native Hawaiians power to govern themselves while remaining U.S. citizens. Voting began in fall 2015 for delegates to a constitutional convention that would determine whether or not such a relationship should exist between Native Hawaiians and the federal government.122 When non-Native Hawaiians and some Native Hawaiians brought suit on the grounds that, by allowing only Native Hawaiians to vote, the process discriminated against members of other ethnic groups, a federal district court found the election to be legal. While the Supreme Court stopped the election, in September 2016 a separate ruling by the Interior Department allowed for a referendum to be held. Native Hawaiians in favor are working to create their own nation.123
2015 年 9 月，美国内政部（下辖印第安事务局）制定了指导方针，旨在帮助夏威夷原住民建立类似于美国原住民和阿拉斯加原住民部落与联邦政府之间关系的自治关系。这种关系将赋予夏威夷原住民自治权，同时保留其美国公民身份。2015 年秋季，夏威夷原住民开始投票选举制宪会议代表，该会议将决定夏威夷原住民与联邦政府之间是否应存在这种关系。 122 一些非夏威夷原住民和部分夏威夷原住民提起诉讼，认为仅允许夏威夷原住民投票的做法歧视其他族裔群体。联邦地区法院裁定选举合法。虽然最高法院叫停了选举，但 2016 年 9 月，内政部的另一项裁决允许举行全民公投。支持全民公投的夏威夷原住民正在努力建立自己的国家。 123

Despite significant advances, American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians still trail behind U.S. citizens of other ethnic backgrounds in many important areas. These groups continue to suffer widespread poverty and high unemployment. Some of the poorest counties in the United States are those in which Native American reservations are located. These minorities are also less likely than White Americans, African Americans, or Asian Americans to complete high school or college.124 Many American Indian and Alaskan tribes endure high rates of infant mortality, alcoholism, and suicide.125 Native Hawaiians are also more likely to live in poverty than White people in Hawaii, and they are more likely than White Hawaiians to be unhoused or unemployed.126
尽管取得了显著进步，但美洲印第安人、阿拉斯加原住民和夏威夷原住民在许多重要领域仍然落后于其他族裔的美国公民。这些群体持续遭受普遍贫困和高失业率的困扰。美国一些最贫困的县就位于美洲原住民保留地内。与白人、非裔美国人或亚裔美国人相比，这些少数族裔完成高中或大学学业的可能性也更低。 124 许多美洲印第安人和阿拉斯加原住民部落都面临着高婴儿死亡率、酗酒和自杀率。 125 夏威夷原住民比夏威夷白人更容易生活在贫困之中，而且他们比夏威夷白人更容易无家可归或失业。 126
