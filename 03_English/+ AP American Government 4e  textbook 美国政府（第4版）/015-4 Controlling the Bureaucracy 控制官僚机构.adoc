As our earlier description of the State Department demonstrates, bureaucracies are incredibly complicated. Understandably, then, the processes of rulemaking and bureaucratic oversight are equally complex. Historically, at least since the end of the spoils system, elected leaders have struggled to maintain control over their bureaucracies. This challenge arises partly due to the fact that elected leaders tend to have partisan motivations, while bureaucracies are designed to avoid partisanship. While that is not the only explanation, elected leaders and citizens have developed laws and institutions to help rein in bureaucracies that become either too independent, corrupt, or both.

正如我们之前对国务院的描述所示，官僚机构极其复杂。因此，制定规则和监督官僚机构的过程同样复杂也就不足为奇了。历史上，至少自分赃制终结以来，民选领导人一直难以控制其官僚机构。这一挑战的部分原因是，民选领导人往往带有党派动机，而官僚机构的设计初衷是为了避免党派偏见。虽然这并非唯一的解释，但民选领导人和公民已经制定了法律和制度，以帮助约束那些过于独立、腐败或两者兼具的官僚机构。

BUREAUCRATIC RULEMAKING  官僚主义的规则制定
Once the particulars of implementation have been spelled out in the legislation authorizing a new program, bureaucracies move to enact it. When they encounter grey areas, many follow the federal negotiated rulemaking process to propose a solution, that is, detailing how particular new federal polices, regulations, and/or programs will be implemented in the agencies. Congress cannot possibly legislate on that level of detail, so the experts in the bureaucracy do so.

[.my2]
一旦新项目的实施细则在授权立法中明确规定，各机构便会着手执行。当遇到模糊地带时，许多机构会遵循联邦政府协商制定规则的程序，提出解决方案，即详细说明具体的联邦新政策、法规和/或项目将在各机构中如何实施。国会不可能就如此细致的细节进行立法，因此这项工作就由各机构的专家来完成。

Negotiated rulemaking is a relatively recently developed bureaucratic device that emerged from the criticisms of bureaucratic inefficiencies in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.32 Before it was adopted, bureaucracies used a procedure called notice-and-comment rulemaking. This practice required that agencies attempting to adopt rules publish their proposal in the Federal Register, the official publication for all federal rules and proposed rules. By publishing the proposal, the bureaucracy was fulfilling its obligation to allow the public time to comment. But rather than encouraging the productive interchange of ideas, the comment period had the effect of creating an adversarial environment in which different groups tended to make extreme arguments for rules that would support their interests. As a result, administrative rulemaking became too lengthy, too contentious, and too likely to provoke litigation in the courts.

[.my2]
协商式规则制定是一种相对较新的官僚机制，源于 20 世纪 70 年代、80 年代和 90 年代对官僚机构效率低下的批评。 32 在协商式规则制定被采用之前，官僚机构使用一种称为 “通知-评论规则制定”的程序。这种做法要求试图通过规则的机构将其提案在《 联邦公报 》（所有联邦规则和拟议规则的官方出版物）上公布。通过公布提案，官僚机构履行了其给予公众评论时间的义务。然而，评论期非但没有促进富有成效的意见交流，反而造成了一种对抗性的环境，不同的群体往往会提出极端论点来支持有利于自身利益的规则。结果，行政规则制定过程变得过于冗长、争议过多，并且极易引发诉讼。

Reformers argued that these inefficiencies needed to be corrected. They proposed the negotiated rulemaking process, often referred to as regulatory negotiation, or “reg-neg” for short. This process was codified in the Negotiated Rulemaking Acts of 1990 and 1996, which encouraged agencies to employ negotiated rulemaking procedures. While negotiated rulemaking is required in only a handful of agencies and plenty still use the traditional process, others have recognized the potential of the new process and have adopted it.

[.my2]
改革者认为这些低效之处需要纠正。他们提出了协商制定规则程序 ，通常被称为监管协商，简称“监管协商”。这一程序被编入 1990 年和 1996 年的 《协商制定规则法案 》，鼓励各机构采用协商制定规则程序。虽然目前只有少数机构强制要求采用协商制定规则，许多机构仍然沿用传统程序，但其他机构已经认识到新程序的潜力并予以采纳。

In negotiated rulemaking, neutral advisors known as convenors put together a committee of those who have vested interests in the proposed rules. The convenors then set about devising procedures for reaching a consensus on the proposed rules. The committee uses these procedures to govern the process through which the committee members discuss the various merits and demerits of the proposals. With the help of neutral mediators, the committee eventually reaches a general consensus on the rules.

[.my2]
在协商制定规则的过程中，被称为召集人的中立顾问会召集一个委员会，成员均为与拟议规则有既得利益的人士。召集人随后着手制定达成共识的程序。委员会运用这些程序来指导成员讨论各项提案的优缺点。在中立调解员的协助下，委员会最终就规则达成普遍共识。

GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATIC OVERSIGHT
政府官僚监督
The ability for bureaucracies to develop their own rules and in many ways control their own budgets has often been a matter of great concern for elected leaders. As a result, elected leaders have employed a number of strategies and devices to control public administrators in the bureaucracy.

[.my2]
官僚机构制定自身规则并在许多方面掌控自身预算的能力，常常令民选领导人极为担忧。因此，民选领导人采取了多种策略和手段来约束官僚机构中的公共管理者。

Congress is particularly empowered to apply oversight of the federal bureaucracy because of its power to control funding and approve presidential appointments. The various bureaucratic agencies submit annual summaries of their activities and budgets for the following year, and committees and subcommittees in both chambers regularly hold hearings to question the leaders of the various bureaucracies. These hearings are often tame, practical, fact-finding missions. Occasionally, however, when a particular bureaucracy has committed or contributed to a blunder of some magnitude, the hearings can become quite animated and testy.

[.my2]
由于国会拥有控制联邦拨款和批准总统任命的权力，因此它特别有权对联邦官僚机构进行监督。各官僚机构每年提交年度活动总结和下一年度预算，两院的委员会和小组委员会定期举行听证会，质询各官僚机构的领导人。这些听证会通常是温和的、务实的、事实调查。然而，有时当某个官僚机构犯下或促成了重大失误时，听证会可能会变得非常激烈和充满火药味。

This occurred in 2013 following the realization by Congress that the IRS had selected for extra scrutiny certain groups that had applied for tax-exempt status. While the error could have been a mere mistake or have resulted from any number of reasons, many in Congress became enraged at the thought that the IRS might purposely use its power to inconvenience citizens and their groups.33 The House directed its Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to launch an investigation into the IRS, during which time it interviewed and publicly scrutinized a number of high-ranking civil servants (Figure 15.11).

[.my2]
此事发生在 2013 年，当时国会意识到美国国税局（IRS）对一些申请免税资格的团体进行了额外审查。虽然这一错误可能仅仅是疏忽，也可能是多种原因造成的，但国会许多议员对此感到愤怒，认为国税局可能会故意滥用权力，给公民及其团体带来不便。 33 众议院指示其监督与政府改革委员会对国税局展开调查，期间该委员会约谈了多名高级公务员，并公开审查了他们的行为（ 图 15.11 ）。

Perhaps Congress’s most powerful oversight tool is the Government Accountability Office (GAO).34 The GAO is an agency that provides Congress, its committees, and the heads of the executive agencies with auditing, evaluation, and investigative services. It is designed to operate in a fact-based and nonpartisan manner to deliver important oversight information where and when it is needed. The GAO’s role is to produce reports, mostly at the insistence of Congress. In the approximately nine hundred reports it completes per year, the GAO sends Congress information about budgetary issues for everything from education, health care, and housing to defense, homeland security, and natural resource management.35 Since it is an office within the federal bureaucracy, the GAO also supplies Congress with its own annual performance and accountability report. This report details the achievements and remaining weaknesses in the actions of the GAO for any given year.

[.my2]
或许国会最有力的监督工具就是政府问责局 （GAO）。 34 GAO 是一个为国会、其各委员会以及行政机构负责人提供审计、评估和调查服务的机构。它的宗旨是以事实为依据，秉持不偏不倚的原则，在需要时提供重要的监督信息。GAO 的职责是撰写报告，这些报告大多是应国会的要求而撰写的。GAO 每年完成约 900 份报告，向国会提供有关预算问题的信息，涵盖教育、医疗保健、住房、国防、国土安全和自然资源管理等各个方面。 35 由于 GAO 是联邦政府机构的一部分，它也向国会提交年度绩效和问责报告。该报告详细阐述了 GAO 在特定年份的工作成果和不足之处。

Apart from Congress, the president also executes oversight over the extensive federal bureaucracy through a number of different avenues. Most directly, the president controls the bureaucracies by appointing the heads of the fifteen cabinet departments and of many independent executive agencies, such as the CIA, the EPA, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. These cabinet and agency appointments go through the Senate for confirmation. These appointees, once approved, serve at the pleasure of the president and carry out initiatives on behalf of the president. In 2025, after being elected to a second, non-consecutive term, President Donald Trump sought to impact the federal bureaucracy quite forcefully. His appointees went along dutifully and implemented Trump’s desire to remove large swaths of probationary employees (those persons typically in their first two years of service to a particular agency) and to put in place hiring freezes across the Federal government. The goal was to have a more efficient federal bureaucracy that did not cost the taxpayers as much to fund. This process was not without controversy, as bureaucrats, media outlets, and members of the public raised concerns about agencies’ continued ability to carry out their missions to serve the public.

[.my2]
除了国会之外，总统还通过多种途径对庞大的联邦官僚机构进行监督。最直接的方式是，总统通过任命十五个内阁部门和众多独立行政机构（例如中央情报局、环境保护署和联邦调查局）的负责人来控制官僚机构。这些内阁和机构的任命需经参议院确认。一旦获得批准，这些被任命者便由总统任命，并代表总统执行各项举措。2025年，在连任第二届（非连续任期）后，唐纳德·特朗普总统试图对联邦官僚机构进行强有力的改革。他的任命官员们忠实地执行了特朗普的命令，解雇了大量试用期员工（通常指在特定机构工作满两年的员工），并在联邦政府各部门实施了招聘冻结。其目标是建立一个更高效、更经济的联邦官僚机构，从而减少纳税人的负担。这一过程并非一帆风顺，官僚机构、媒体和公众都对各机构能否继续履行服务公众的使命表示担忧。

Especially salient in the late spring 2025, as storm season erupted on the Central Plains and ahead of hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico,, were the significant cuts to the National Weather Service. The National Weather Service is located in the Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) with forecast offices embedded across the country. The agency systematically gathers data and makes predictions about weather patterns in order to protect citizens and their property. Citizens, community leaders and weather journalists make regular use of their data and predictions on a daily basis. Systemwide, as of May 2025, there was a 19% vacancy rate of NWS staff across its 119 field offices, with some offices seeing a 40% vacancy rate. These staff shortages impacted the agency’s ability to send up weather balloons to gather critical data ahead of the arrival of storm systems.36
2025 年春末，随着中部平原风暴季的到来以及大西洋和墨西哥湾飓风季的临近，国家气象局的大幅裁员尤为引人注目。国家气象局隶属于商务部下属的国家海洋和大气管理局（NOAA），在全国各地设有预报办公室。该机构系统地收集数据并预测天气模式，以保护公民及其财产安全。公民、社区领袖和气象记者每天都会使用他们的数据和预测。截至 2025 年 5 月，国家气象局 119 个外地办事处的员工空缺率高达 19 %，部分办事处的空缺率甚至高达 40%。人员短缺影响了该机构在风暴系统到来之前放飞气象气球收集关键数据的能力。

The other important channel through which the office of the president conducts oversight over the federal bureaucracy is the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).37 The primary responsibility of the OMB is to produce the president’s annual budget for the country. With this huge responsibility, however, comes a number of other responsibilities. These include reporting to the president on the actions of the various executive departments and agencies in the federal government, overseeing the performance levels of the bureaucracies, coordinating and reviewing federal regulations for the president, and delivering executive orders and presidential directives to the various agency heads.

[.my2]
总统办公室监督联邦官僚机构的另一个重要渠道是管理和预算办公室（OMB）。 37 OMB 的主要职责是编制总统的年度国家预算。然而，伴随这项重大责任而来的还有许多其他职责。这些职责包括向总统汇报联邦政府各行政部门和机构的行动，监督官僚机构的绩效水平，协调和审查联邦法规，以及向各机构负责人传达行政命令和总统指令。

Controversy and the CFPB: Overseeing a Bureau Whose Job Is Oversight
争议与消费者金融保护局：监督一个以监督为职责的机构
During the 1990s, the two political parties in the United States had largely come together over the issue of the federal bureaucracy. While differences remained, a great number of bipartisan attempts to roll back the size of government took place during the Clinton administration. This shared effort began to fall apart during the presidency of Republican George W. Bush, who made repeated attempts to use contracting and privatization to reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy more than Democrats were willing to accept.

[.my2]
上世纪 90 年代，美国两大政党在联邦官僚机构问题上基本达成共识。尽管仍存在分歧，但在克林顿执政期间，两党曾多次合作尝试缩减政府规模。然而，这种合作努力在共和党总统乔治·W·布什执政期间开始瓦解。布什总统多次试图通过外包和私有化来大幅削减联邦官僚机构的规模，但民主党人对此并不买账。

This growing division was further compounded by Great Recession that began in 2007. For many on the left side of the political spectrum, the onset of the recession reflected a failure of weakened federal bureaucracies to properly regulate the financial markets. To those on the right, it merely reinforced the belief that government bureaucracies are inherently inefficient. Over the next few years, as the government attempted to grapple with the consequences of the recession, these divisions only grew.

[.my2]
这种日益加剧的分歧因始于2007年的大衰退而进一步恶化。对许多左翼人士而言，衰退的到来反映出疲弱的联邦政府机构未能有效监管金融市场。而对右翼人士来说，这仅仅强化了他们对政府机构效率低下的固有印象。在接下来的几年里，随着政府努力应对衰退的后果，这些分歧反而愈演愈烈。

The debate over one particular bureaucratic response to the recession provides important insight into these divisions. The bureau in question is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an agency created in 2011 specifically to oversee certain financial industries that had proven themselves to be especially prone to abusive practices, such as sub-prime mortgage lenders and payday lenders. To many in the Republican Party, this new bureau was merely another instance of growing the federal bureaucracy to take care of problems caused by an inefficient government. To many in the Democratic Party, the new agency was an important cop on a notably chaotic street.

[.my2]
围绕一项应对经济衰退的官僚机构措施的争论，为我们深入了解这些分歧提供了重要的视角。该机构即消费者金融保护局 （CFPB），它成立于 2011 年，专门负责监管某些金融行业，这些行业已被证明特别容易出现滥用行为，例如次级抵押贷款机构和发薪日贷款机构。在许多共和党人看来，这个新机构只不过是联邦政府为了解决效率低下的问题而不断扩张官僚机构的又一例证。而在许多民主党人看来，这个新机构就像是混乱局面中的重要执法者。

Divisions over this agency were so bitter that Republicans refused for a time to allow the Senate to consider confirming anyone to head the new bureau (Figure 15.12). Many wanted the bureau either scrapped or headed by a committee that would have to generate consensus in order to act. They attempted to cut the bureau’s budget and erected mountains of red tape designed to slow the CFPB’s achievement of its goals. During the height of the recession, many Democrats saw these tactics as a particularly destructive form of obstruction while the country reeled from the financial collapse.

[.my2]
围绕这个机构的分歧如此之大，以至于共和党人一度拒绝让参议院审议任何新局长的任命（ 图 15.12 ）。许多人希望要么废除该局，要么将其改为由一个必须达成共识才能采取行动的委员会领导。他们试图削减该局的预算，并设置重重障碍，旨在拖慢消费者金融保护局（CFPB）实现其目标的步伐。在经济衰退最严重的时候，许多民主党人认为，在国家遭受金融崩溃重创之际，这些策略是一种极具破坏性的阻挠手段。

As the recession receded into the past, however, the political heat the CFPB once generated steadily declined. Republicans still pushed to reduce the power of the bureau and Democrats in general still supported it, but lack of urgency pushed these differences into the background. Indeed, there may be a growing consensus between the two parties that the bureau should be more tightly controlled. In the spring of 2016, as the agency was announcing new rules to help further restrict the predatory practices of payday lenders, a handful of Democratic members of Congress, including the party chair, joined Republicans to draft legislation to prevent the CFPB from further regulating lenders. This trajectory continued in the Trump Administration where there were significant efforts made to slow the agency down dramatically.38
然而，随着经济衰退逐渐消退，消费者金融保护局（CFPB）曾经引发的政治热度也稳步下降。共和党人仍然力图削弱该局的权力，而民主党人总体上仍然支持它，但由于缺乏紧迫感，这些分歧逐渐被搁置。事实上，两党之间可能正在形成一种日益增长的共识，即应该对该局进行更严格的监管。2016 年春季，当该机构宣布新规以进一步限制发薪日贷款机构的掠夺性行为时，包括民主党主席在内的几位民主党国会议员与共和党人联手起草了一项法案，旨在阻止 CFPB 进一步监管贷款机构。这一趋势在特朗普政府时期仍在延续，政府曾大力采取措施大幅削弱该机构的运作。 38

What do these divisions suggest about the way Congress exercises oversight over the federal bureaucracy? Do you think this oversight is an effective way to control a bureaucracy as large and complex as the U.S. federal bureaucracy? Why or why not?
这些分歧表明国会在监督联邦官僚机构方面存在哪些问题？你认为这种监督方式对于控制像美国联邦官僚机构这样庞大而复杂的机构是否有效？为什么？

CITIZEN BUREAUCRATIC OVERSIGHT
公民官僚监督
A number of laws passed in the decades between the end of the Second World War and the late 1970s have created a framework through which citizens can exercise their own bureaucratic oversight. The two most important laws are the Freedom of Information Act of 1966 and the Government in Sunshine Act of 1976.39 Like many of the modern bureaucratic reforms in the United States, both emerged during a period of heightened skepticism about government activities.

[.my2]
从二战结束到 20 世纪 70 年代末的几十年间，通过的一系列法律构建了一个框架，使公民能够行使自身的官僚监督权。其中最重要的两项法律是 1966 年的《 信息自由法》 和 1976 年的 《阳光政府法》。 39 与美国许多现代官僚改革一样，这两项法律的出现都正值人们对政府活动普遍持怀疑态度的时期。

The first, the Freedom of Information Act of 1966 (FOIA), emerged in the early years of the Johnson presidency as the United States was conducting secret Cold War missions around the world, the U.S. military was becoming increasingly mired in the conflict in Vietnam, and questions were still swirling around the Kennedy assassination. FOIA provides journalists and the general public the right to request records from various federal agencies. These agencies are required by law to release that information unless it qualifies for one of nine exemptions. These exceptions cite sensitive issues related to national security or foreign policy, internal personnel rules, trade secrets, violations of personnel privacy rights, law enforcement information, and oil well data (Figure 15.13). FOIA also compels agencies to post some types of information for the public regularly without being requested.

[.my2]
第一项法律是 1966 年的《信息自由法》（FOIA），它诞生于约翰逊总统执政初期，当时美国正在全球范围内开展秘密的冷战行动，美军在越南战争中日益深陷泥潭，而肯尼迪遇刺案的疑点也依然悬而未决。FOIA 赋予记者和公众向各联邦机构索取记录的权利。法律规定，除非符合九项豁免条款之一，否则这些机构必须公开这些信息。这些豁免条款涵盖了与国家安全或外交政策相关的敏感问题、内部人事规则、商业秘密、侵犯人事隐私权、执法信息以及油井数据（ 图 15.13 ）。FOIA 还强制要求各机构定期向公众公开某些类型的信息，而无需公众提出请求。

In fiscal year 2020, the government received 772,869 FOIA requests, with just three departments—Defense, Homeland Security, and Justice—accounting for more than half those queries.40 The Center for Effective Government analyzed the fifteen federal agencies that receive the most FOIA requests and concluded that they generally struggle to implement public disclosure rules. In its latest report, published in 2015 and using 2012 and 2013 data (the most recent available), ten of the fifteen did not earn satisfactory overall grades, scoring less than seventy of a possible one hundred points.41
2020 财年，美国政府共收到 772,869 份《信息自由法》（FOIA）申请，其中国防部、国土安全部和司法部这三个部门的申请数量就占了一半以上。 40 有效政府中心分析了收到 FOIA 申请最多的 15 个联邦机构，并得出结论：这些机构普遍难以有效执行信息公开规则。在其 2015 年发布的最新报告中（该报告使用了 2012 年和 2013 年的数据，这是目前可获得的最新数据），这 15 个机构中有 10 个的总体评分不理想，得分低于 70 分（满分 100 分）。 41

The Government in Sunshine Act of 1976 is different from FOIA in that it requires all multi-headed federal agencies to hold their meetings in a public forum on a regular basis. The name “Sunshine Act” is derived from the old adage that “sunlight is the best disinfectant”—the implication being that governmental and bureaucratic corruption thrive in secrecy but shrink when exposed to the light of public scrutiny. The act defines a meeting as any gathering of agency members in person or by phone, whether in a formal or informal manner.

[.my2]
1976 年的《阳光政府法案》与《信息自由法案》（FOIA）的不同之处在于，它要求所有多部门领导的联邦机构定期在公开论坛上举行会议。“阳光法案”的名称源于一句古老的谚语：“阳光是最好的消毒剂”——其含义是，政府和官僚机构的腐败在秘密中滋生，但在公众监督下则会萎缩。该法案将会议定义为机构成员以任何形式（包括亲自会面或电话会议）进行的聚会，无论形式正式与否。

Like FOIA, the Sunshine Act allows for exceptions. These include meetings where classified information is discussed, proprietary data has been submitted for review, employee privacy matters are discussed, criminal matters are brought up, and information would prove financially harmful to companies were it released. Citizens and citizen groups can also follow rulemaking and testify at hearings held around the country on proposed rules. The rulemaking process and the efforts by federal agencies to keep open records and solicit public input on important changes are examples of responsive bureaucracy.

[.my2]
与《信息自由法》（FOIA）类似，《阳光法案》也允许存在例外情况。这些例外情况包括：讨论机密信息、提交审查的专有数据、讨论员工隐私问题、提出刑事案件，以及信息一旦公开将对公司造成经济损失。公民和公民团体也可以关注规则制定过程，并在全国各地举行的关于拟议规则的听证会上作证。规则制定过程以及联邦机构为保持记录公开和就重要变更征求公众意见所做的努力，都是响应型官僚机构的例证。

GOVERNMENT PRIVATIZATION
政府私有化
A more extreme, and in many instances, more controversial solution to the perceived and real inefficiencies in the bureaucracy is privatization. In the United States, largely because it was born during the Enlightenment and has a long history of championing free-market principles, the urge to privatize government services has never been as strong as it is in many other countries. There are simply far fewer government-run services. Nevertheless, the federal government has used forms of privatization and contracting throughout its history. But following the growth of bureaucracy and government services during President Johnson’s Great Society in the mid-1960s, a particularly vocal movement began calling for a rollback of government services.

[.my2]
针对官僚机构效率低下（无论实际存在还是人们普遍认为存在低下）的一种更为极端，且在很多情况下更具争议的解决方案是私有化 。在美国，这主要是因为美国诞生于启蒙运动时期，并且长期以来一直倡导自由市场原则，因此，政府服务私有化的呼声从未像其他许多国家那样强烈。毕竟，美国的政府运营服务种类远少于其他国家。尽管如此，联邦政府在其发展历程中也曾采用过各种形式的私有化和外包。然而，随着约翰逊总统在 20 世纪 60 年代中期推行“伟大社会”计划，官僚机构和政府服务规模不断扩张，一股要求缩减政府服务规模的呼声也随之高涨。

This movement grew stronger in the 1970s and 1980s as politicians, particularly on the right, declared that air needed to be let out of the bloated federal government. In the 1990s, as President Bill Clinton and especially his vice president, Al Gore, worked to aggressively shrink the federal bureaucracy, privatization came to be embraced across the political spectrum.42 The rhetoric of privatization—that market competition would stimulate innovation and efficiency—sounded like the proper remedy to many people and still does. But to many others, talk of privatization is worrying. They contend that certain government functions are simply not possible to replicate in a private context.

[.my2]
20 世纪 70 年代和 80 年代，随着政客们，尤其是右翼政客，宣称需要精简臃肿的联邦政府，私有化运动日益壮大。到了 90 年代，随着比尔·克林顿总统，尤其是他的副总统阿尔· 戈尔大力精简联邦官僚机构，私有化逐渐被各政治派别所接受。42 私有化的论调——市场竞争将刺激创新和提高效率——在许多人看来是解决之道，至今依然如此。但对另一些人来说，谈论私有化却令人担忧。他们认为，某些政府职能根本无法在私营环境下复制。

When those in government speak of privatization, they are often referring to one of a host of different models that incorporate the market forces of the private sector into the function of government to varying degrees.43 These include using contractors to supply goods and/or services, distributing government vouchers with which citizens can purchase formerly government-controlled services on the private market, supplying government grants to private organizations to administer government programs, collaborating with a private entity to finance a government program, and even fully divesting the government of a function and directly giving it to the private sector (Figure 15.14). We will look at three of these types of privatization shortly.

[.my2]
当政府官员谈到私有化时，他们通常指的是一系列不同的模式，这些模式在不同程度上将私营部门的市场力量融入政府职能。 43 这些模式包括：利用承包商提供商品和/或服务；发放政府代金券，让公民可以用这些代金券在私营市场上购买以前由政府控制的服务；向私营机构提供政府拨款，用于管理政府项目；与私营实体合作，为政府项目提供资金；甚至将政府的某项职能完全剥离，直接交给私营部门（ 图 15.14 ）。我们稍后将探讨其中三种私有化模式。

Divestiture, or full privatization, occurs when government services are transferred, usually through sale, from government bureaucratic control into an entirely market-based, private environment. At the federal level this form of privatization is very rare, although it does occur. Consider the Student Loan Marketing Association, often referred to by its nickname, Sallie Mae. When it was created in 1973, it was designed to be a government entity for processing federal student education loans. Over time, however, it gradually moved further from its original purpose and became increasingly private. Sallie Mae reached full privatization in 2004 and now only services private student loans.44 , 45 Another example is the U.S. Investigations Services, Inc., which was once the investigative branch of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) until it was privatized in the 1990s. At the state level, however, the privatization of roads, public utilities, bridges, schools, and even prisons has become increasingly common as state and municipal authorities look for ways to reduce the cost of government.

剥离，或称完全私有化，是指政府服务（通常通过出售）从政府官僚机构的控制下转移到完全基于市场的私营环境中。在联邦层面，这种形式的私有化非常罕见，但并非完全没有。以学生贷款营销协会（Student Loan Marketing Association，简称 Sallie Mae）为例。该协会成立于 1973 年，最初是作为政府机构处理联邦学生教育贷款的。然而，随着时间的推移，它逐渐偏离了最初的目标，并变得越来越私有化。Sallie Mae 于 2004 年完成完全私有化，现在只提供私人学生贷款服务。 44 , 45 另一个例子是美国调查服务公司（US Investigations Services, Inc.），该公司曾是人事管理办公室（OPM）的调查部门，直到 20 世纪 90 年代被私有化。然而，在州一级，道路、公共事业、桥梁、学校甚至监狱的私有化已经变得越来越普遍，因为州和市政当局都在寻求降低政府成本的方法。

Possibly the best-known form of privatization is the process of issuing government contracts to private companies in order for them to provide necessary services. This process grew to prominence during President Bill Clinton’s National Partnership for Reinventing Government initiative, intended to streamline the government bureaucracy. Under President George W. Bush, the use of contracting out federal services reached new heights. During the Iraq War, for example, large corporations like Kellogg Brown & Root, owned by Haliburton at the time, signed government contracts to perform a number of services once done by the military, such as military base construction, food preparation, and even laundry services. By 2006, reliance on contracting to run the war was so great that contractors outnumbered soldiers. Such contracting has faced quite a bit of criticism for both its high cost and its potential for corruption and inefficiencies.46 However, it has become so routine that it is unlikely to slow any time soon.

私有化最广为人知的形式或许就是政府将必要服务外包给私营公司。这一过程在比尔·克林顿总统的“国家政府改革伙伴关系”计划期间蓬勃发展，该计划旨在精简政府机构。在乔治·W·布什总统时期，联邦服务外包的使用达到了前所未有的高度。例如，在伊拉克战争期间，像当时隶属于哈利伯顿公司的凯洛格·布朗·鲁特这样的大型企业签署了政府合同，承担了许多原本由军方提供的服务，例如军事基地建设、食品供应，甚至洗衣服务。到 2006 年，战争对外包的依赖程度如此之高，以至于承包商的数量超过了士兵。这种外包模式因其高昂的成本以及潜在的腐败和低效问题而饱受诟病。 然而 ，由于外包已成为一种常态，短期内不太可能放缓。

Third-party financing is a far more complex form of privatization than divestiture or contracting. Here the federal government signs an agreement with a private entity so the two can form a special-purpose vehicle to take ownership of the object being financed. The special-purpose vehicle is empowered to reach out to private financial markets to borrow money. This type of privatization is typically used to finance government office space, military base housing, and other large infrastructure projects. Departments like the Congressional Budget Office have frequently criticized this form of privatization as particularly inefficient and costly for the government.

第三方融资是一种比资产剥离或合同外包更为复杂的私有化形式。在这种形式下，联邦政府与一家私营实体签署协议，双方共同成立一家特殊目的实体（SPV） ，以取得所融资项目的所有权。该 SPV 有权进入私人金融市场借款。这种私有化方式通常用于为政府办公场所、军事基地住房和其他大型基础设施项目提供资金。国会预算办公室等部门经常批评这种私有化方式效率低下且成本高昂。

One of the most important forms of bureaucratic oversight comes from inside the bureaucracy itself. Those within are in the best position to recognize and report on misconduct. But bureaucracies tend to jealously guard their reputations and are generally resistant to criticism from without and from within. This can create quite a problem for insiders who recognize and want to report mismanagement and even criminal behavior. The personal cost of doing the right thing can be prohibitive.47 For a typical bureaucrat faced with the option of reporting corruption and risking possible termination or turning the other way and continuing to earn a living, the choice is sometimes easy.

官僚机构最重要的监督形式之一来自其内部。内部人员最能识别和举报不当行为。但官僚机构往往极力维护自身声誉，通常对来自外部和内部的批评都持抵制态度。这会给那些发现并希望举报管理不善甚至犯罪行为的内部人员带来相当大的难题。做正确事情的个人代价可能非常高昂。 47 对于一个典型的官僚来说，面对举报腐败可能面临被解雇的风险，还是选择视而不见继续谋生的选择，有时很容易做出决定。

Under heightened skepticism due to government inefficiency and outright corruption in the 1970s, government officials began looking for solutions. When Congress drafted the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, it specifically included rights for federal whistleblowers, those who publicize misdeeds committed within a bureaucracy or other organization, and set up protection from reprisals. The act’s Merit Systems Protection Board is a quasi-juridical institutional board headed by three members appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate that hears complaints, conducts investigations into possible abuses, and institutes protections for bureaucrats who speak out.48 Over time, Congress and the president have strengthened these protections with additional acts. These include the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 and the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012, which further compelled federal agencies to protect whistleblowers who reasonably perceive that an institution or the people in the institution are acting inappropriately (Figure 15.15).

20 世纪 70 年代，由于政府效率低下和公然腐败，公众对政府的怀疑情绪日益高涨，政府官员开始寻求解决方案。1978 年，国会起草了《 公务员制度改革法案》 ，其中明确规定了联邦举报人的权利 ， 即那些揭露官僚机构或其他组织内部不当行为的人，并设立了免受报复的保护措施。该法案设立的“功绩制保护委员会”是一个准司法机构，由总统任命、参议院确认的三名成员组成，负责听取投诉、调查可能的滥用职权行为，并为敢于发声的官员提供保护。 48 随着时间的推移，国会和总统通过一系列法案进一步加强了这些保护措施。其中包括 1989 年的 《举报人保护法》 和 2012 年的 《举报人保护加强法》 ，这两项法律进一步强制联邦机构保护那些合理地认为某个机构或机构中的人员行为不当的举报人（ 图 15.15 ）。

A copy of the first page of the letter that led to Donald Trump's first impeachment begins, “Dear Chairman Schiff and Ranking Member Nunes: On August 12, 2019, the Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (ICIG) received a disclosure from an individual (hereinafter “the Complainant”) regarding an alleged “urgent concern,” pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § 3033(k)(5)(A).” Next to the image of the letter is an image of a person's silhouette with a question mark over the silhouette.
