== 释义




While the federal bureaucracy grew by leaps and bounds during the twentieth century, it also underwent a very different evolution. Beginning with the Pendleton Act in the 1880s, the bureaucracy shifted away from the spoils system toward a merit system. The distinction between these two forms of bureaucracy is crucial. The evolution toward a civil service in the United States had important functional consequences. Today the United States has a civil service that carefully regulates hiring practices and pay to create an environment in which, it is hoped, the best people to fulfill each civil service responsibility are the same people hired to fill those positions.

尽管联邦官僚机构在二十世纪经历了飞速发展，但其演变过程却截然不同。自 19 世纪 80 年代 《彭德尔顿法案》 颁布以来，官僚机构逐渐摒弃了分赃制，转而采用择优制。区分这两种官僚机构形式至关重要。美国向公务员制度的转变产生了重要的实际影响。如今，美国的公务员制度对招聘和薪酬进行了严格的监管，力求营造一种环境，使最能胜任各项公务职责的人才被聘用填补这些职位。

THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION
公务员委员会
The Pendleton Act of 1883 was not merely an important piece of reform legislation; it also established the foundations for the merit-based system that emerged in the decades that followed. It accomplished this through a number of important changes, although three elements stand out as especially significant. First, the law attempted to reduce the impact of politics on the civil service sector by making it illegal to fire or otherwise punish government workers for strictly political reasons. Second, the law raised the qualifications for employment in civil service positions by requiring applicants to pass exams designed to test their competence in a number of important skill and knowledge areas. Third, it allowed for the creation of the United States Civil Service Commission (CSC), which was charged with enforcing the elements of the law.15
1883 年的《彭德尔顿法案》不仅是一项重要的改革立法，它还为随后几十年兴起的择优录用制度奠定了基础。该法案通过一系列重要变革实现了这一目标，其中有三项尤为突出。首先，该法案试图减少政治对公务员部门的影响，规定仅因政治原因解雇或惩罚政府雇员属于违法行为。其次，该法案提高了公务员职位的任职资格，要求申请人通过旨在测试其在多项重要技能和知识领域能力的考试。第三，该法案允许设立美国公务员委员会 （CSC），负责执行该法案的各项条款。 15

The CSC, as created by the Pendleton Act, was to be made up of three commissioners, only two of whom could be from the same political party. These commissioners were given the responsibility of developing and applying the competitive examinations for civil service positions, ensuring that the civil service appointments were apportioned among the several states based on population, and seeing to it that no person in the public service is obligated to contribute to any political cause. The CSC was also charged with ensuring that all civil servants wait for a probationary period before being appointed and that no appointee uses their official authority to affect political changes either through coercion or influence. Both Congress and the president oversaw the CSC by requiring the commission to supply an annual report on its activities first to the president and then to Congress.

根据《彭德尔顿法案》设立的公务员委员会（CSC）由三名委员组成，其中最多只能有两名委员来自同一政党。这些委员的职责包括制定和实施公务员职位竞争性考试，确保公务员职位按人口比例分配给各邦，并保障所有公务员不被迫为任何政治事业捐款。公务员委员会还负责确保所有公务员在正式任命前都必须经过试用期，并且任何被任命者都不得利用其职权通过胁迫或影响力来影响政治变革。国会和总统都对公务员委员会进行监督，要求该委员会每年向总统和国会提交年度工作报告。

In 1883, civil servants under the control of the commission amounted to about 10 percent of the entire government workforce. However, over the next few decades, this percentage increased dramatically. The effects on the government itself of both the law and the increase in the size of the civil service were huge. Presidents and representatives were no longer spending their days doling out or terminating appointments. Consequently, the many members of the civil service could no longer count on their political patrons for job security. Of course, job security was never guaranteed before the Pendleton Act because all positions were subject to the rise and fall of political parties. However, with civil service appointments no longer tied to partisan success, bureaucrats began to look to each other in order to create the job security the previous system had lacked. One of the most important ways they did this was by creating civil service organizations such as the National Association of All Civil Service Employees, formed in 1896. This organization worked to further civil service reform, especially in the area most important to civil service professionals: ensuring greater job security and maintaining the distance between themselves and the political parties that once controlled them.16
1883 年，受委员会管辖的公务员约占政府全体员工的 10%。然而，在接下来的几十年里，这一比例急剧上升。该法案及其对公务员队伍规模扩大的影响对政府本身产生了巨大影响。总统和众议员不再需要花费大量时间任命或解雇官员。因此，许多公务员再也无法指望他们的政治靠山来保障工作。当然，在《彭德尔顿法案》颁布之前，工作保障从未得到过保证，因为所有职位都受到政党兴衰的影响。然而，随着公务员任命不再与党派成败挂钩，官僚们开始互相扶持，以建立此前制度所缺乏的工作保障。他们实现这一目标的最重要途径之一是创建公务员组织，例如成立于 1896 年的全国公务员协会。该组织致力于推进公务员制度改革，尤其是在对公务员而言最为重要的领域：确保更大的工作保障，并保持自身与曾经控制他们的政党之间的距离。 16

Over the next few decades, civil servants gravitated to labor unions in much the same way that employees in the private sector did. Through the power of their collective voices amplified by their union representatives, they were able to achieve political influence. The growth of federal labor unions accelerated after the Lloyd–La Follette Act of 1912, which removed many of the penalties civil servants faced when joining a union. As the size of the federal government and its bureaucracy grew following the Great Depression and the Roosevelt reforms, many became increasingly concerned that the Pendleton Act prohibitions on political activities by civil servants were no longer strong enough. As a result of these mounting concerns, Congress passed the Hatch Act of 1939—or the Political Activities Act. The main provision of this legislation prohibits bureaucrats from actively engaging in political campaigns and from using their federal authority via bureaucratic rank to influence the outcomes of nominations and elections.

[.my2]
在接下来的几十年里，公务员加入工会的趋势与私营部门雇员大致相同。通过工会代表的集体发声，他们得以获得政治影响力。1912 年《劳埃德-拉福莱特法案》的颁布加速了联邦工会的发展，该法案取消了公务员加入工会时面临的诸多惩罚。随着大萧条和罗斯福改革后联邦政府及其官僚机构规模的不断扩大，许多人越来越担心《彭德尔顿法案》对公务员政治活动的禁令已不足以有效制约。鉴于这些日益增长的担忧，国会于 1939 年通过了《 哈奇法案》 （又称《政治活动法》）。该法案的主要条款禁止公务员积极参与政治竞选活动，并禁止他们利用职权影响提名和选举结果。

Despite the efforts throughout the 1930s to build stronger walls of separation between the civil service bureaucrats and the political system that surrounds them, many citizens continued to grow skeptical of the growing bureaucracy. These concerns reached a high point in the late 1970s as the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal prompted the public to a fever pitch of skepticism about government itself. Congress and the president responded with the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which abolished the Civil Service Commission. In its place, the law created two new federal agencies: the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). The OPM has responsibility for recruiting, interviewing, and testing potential government employees in order to choose those who should be hired. The MSPB is responsible for investigating charges of agency wrongdoing and hearing appeals when corrective actions are ordered. Together these new federal agencies were intended to correct perceived and real problems with the merit system, protect employees from managerial abuse, and generally make the bureaucracy more efficient.17
尽管 20 世纪 30 年代各方努力加强公务员与政治体系之间的隔离，但许多公民对日益庞大的官僚机构仍持怀疑态度。20 世纪 70 年代末，随着越南战争和水门事件的爆发，公众对政府本身的怀疑情绪达到了顶峰。国会和总统随即通过了 1978 年 《公务员制度改革法案》 ，废除了公务员委员会。取而代之的是，该法案设立了两个新的联邦机构： 人事管理办公室 （OPM）和功绩制保护委员会 （MSPB）。OPM 负责招聘、面试和测试潜在的政府雇员，以选拔合适的人选。MSPB 负责调查机构不当行为的指控，并在下令采取纠正措施时受理上诉。这两个新联邦机构旨在纠正人们对功绩制存在的实际和潜在的问题，保护雇员免受管理人员的滥用职权，并提高官僚机构的整体效率。 17

MERIT-BASED SELECTION  择优选拔
The general trend from the 1880s to today has been toward a civil service system that is increasingly based on merit (Figure 15.6). In this system, the large majority of jobs in individual bureaucracies are tied to the needs of the organization rather than to the political needs of the party bosses or political leaders. This purpose is reflected in the way civil service positions are advertised. A general civil service position announcement will describe the government agency or office seeking an employee, an explanation of what the agency or office does, an explanation of what the position requires, and a list of the knowledge, skills, and abilities, commonly referred to as KSAs, deemed especially important for fulfilling the role. A budget analyst position, for example, would include KSAs such as experience with automated financial systems, knowledge of budgetary regulations and policies, the ability to communicate orally, and demonstrated skills in budget administration, planning, and formulation. The merit system requires that a person be evaluated based on ability to demonstrate KSAs that match those described or better. The individual who is hired should have better KSAs than the other applicants.

从 19 世纪 80 年代至今，公务员制度的总体趋势是日益注重择优录用（ 图 15.6 ）。在该制度下，各级政府机构中的绝大多数职位都与机构的实际需求挂钩，而非与党魁或政治领导人的政治需求挂钩。这一原则体现在公务员职位的招聘广告中。一般的公务员职位公告会描述招聘单位或部门，解释该单位或部门的职能，说明职位要求，并列出履行该职位至关重要的知识、技能和能力（简称 KSA）。例如，预算分析师职位所需的 KSA 包括：具备自动化财务系统使用经验、了解预算法规和政策、具备良好的口头沟通能力，以及在预算管理、规划和编制方面展现出的能力。择优录用制度要求根据应聘者展现出的 KSA 来评估其能力，确保其达到或超过职位描述中列出的 KSA。最终被录用者应具备比其他应聘者更优秀的 KSA。

Figure 15.6 Historically, African Americans have gravitated to the civil service in large numbers, although it was only in 2009 that an African American, Eric Holder (pictured here), rose to the position of U.S. attorney general. As of 2017, African Americans represented 18.2 percent of the federal workforce, a number disproportionately larger than their share of the population (13.4 percent).18 While there are many reasons for this, a prominent one is that the merit-based nature of the civil service offered African Americans far more opportunities for advancement than the private sector, where racial discrimination played a large role.

图 15.6 历史上，非裔美国人大量涌入公务员队伍，尽管直到 2009 年，非裔美国人埃里克·霍尔德（如图所示）才晋升为美国司法部长。截至 2017 年，非裔美国人占联邦政府雇员的 18.2%，这一比例远高于其在总人口中的比例（13.4%）。18 造成这种情况的原因有很多，其中一个重要原因是，公务员制度的择优录用机制为非裔美国人提供了比私营部门多得多的晋升机会，而私营部门中种族歧视现象十分普遍。
Many years ago, the merit system would have required all applicants to also test well on a civil service exam, as was stipulated by the Pendleton Act. This mandatory testing has since been abandoned, and now approximately eighty-five percent of all federal government jobs are filled through an examination of the applicant’s education, background, knowledge, skills, and abilities.19 That would suggest that some 20 percent are filled through appointment and patronage. Among the first group, those hired based on merit, a small percentage still require that applicants take one of the several civil service exams. These are sometimes positions that require applicants to demonstrate broad critical thinking skills, such as foreign service jobs. More often these exams are required for positions demanding specific or technical knowledge, such as customs officials, air traffic controllers, and federal law enforcement officers. Additionally, new online tests are increasingly being used to screen the ever-growing pool of applicants.20
多年前，根据《彭德尔顿法案》的规定，择优录用制度要求所有申请人必须通过公务员考试。但这项强制性考试已被废除，如今，大约 85%的联邦政府职位是通过对申请人的教育背景、知识、技能和能力进行考核来填补的。 19 这意味着大约 20%的职位是通过任命和人事任命的方式填补的。在第一类择优录用的职位中，仍有一小部分要求申请人参加公务员考试。这些职位有时需要申请人展现出广泛的批判性思维能力，例如外交官。而更多时候，这些考试是那些需要特定或技术知识的职位所必需的，例如海关官员、空中交通管制员和联邦执法人员。此外，新的在线测试也越来越多地被用于筛选日益增长的申请人群体。 20

Civil service exams currently test for skills applicable to clerical workers, postal service workers, military personnel, health and social workers, and accounting and engineering employees among others. Applicants with the highest scores on these tests are most likely to be hired for the desired position. Like all organizations, bureaucracies must make thoughtful investments in human capital. And even after hiring people, they must continue to train and develop them to reap the investment they make during the hiring process.

公务员考试目前测试的技能涵盖文员、邮政人员、军人、卫生和社会工作者以及会计和工程等多个领域。考试成绩最高的申请人最有可能被录用。与所有组织一样，官僚机构必须对人力资本进行深思熟虑的投资。即使在人员聘用之后，他们也必须持续对其进行培训和发展，才能从招聘过程中的投资中获得回报。

A Career in Government: Competitive Service, Excepted Service, Senior Executive Service
政府职业：竞争性公务员、特聘公务员、高级行政公务员
One of the significant advantages of the enormous modern U.S. bureaucracy is that many citizens find employment there to be an important source of income and meaning in their lives. Job opportunities exist in a number of different fields, from foreign service with the State Department to information and record clerking at all levels. Each position requires specific background, education, experience, and skills.

[.my2]
庞大的现代美国官僚机构的一大优势在于，许多公民发现，在那里工作是他们重要的收入来源和生活意义所在。就业机会涵盖众多领域，从国务院的外交工作到各级信息和档案文员，应有尽有。每个职位都要求特定的背景、教育、经验和技能。

There are three general categories of work in the federal government: competitive service, excepted service, and senior executive service. Competitive service positions are closely regulated by Congress through the Office of Personnel Management to ensure they are filled in a fair way and the best applicant gets the job (Figure 15.7). Qualifications for these jobs include work history, education, and grades on civil service exams. Federal jobs in the excepted service category are exempt from these hiring restrictions. Either these jobs require a far more rigorous hiring process, such as is the case at the Central Intelligence Agency, or they call for very specific skills, such as in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Excepted service jobs allow employers to set their own pay rates and requirements. Finally, senior executive service positions are filled by men and women who are able to demonstrate their experience in executive positions. These are leadership positions, and applicants must demonstrate certain executive core qualifications (ECQs). These qualifications are leading change, being results-driven, demonstrating business acumen, and building better coalitions.

联邦政府的工作大致分为三类：竞争性职位、例外职位和高级行政职位。 竞争性职位由国会通过人事管理办公室进行严格监管，以确保公平选拔，并让最优秀的申请人获得职位（ 图 15.7 ）。这些职位的资格要求包括工作经历、教育背景和公务员考试成绩。 例外职位不受这些招聘限制。这些职位要么需要更为严格的招聘流程，例如中央情报局，要么需要非常具体的技能，例如核管理委员会。例外职位允许雇主自行设定薪酬标准和要求。最后， 高级行政职位由能够证明其在行政岗位上拥有丰富经验的男性和女性担任。这些职位属于领导岗位，申请人必须展现出某些核心行政素质（ECQ）。这些素质包括引领变革、以结果为导向、展现商业敏锐度以及建立更有效的合作关系。

Civil servants receive pay based on the U.S. Federal General Schedule. A pay schedule is a chart that shows salary ranges for different levels (grades) of positions vertically and for different ranks (steps) of seniority horizontally. The Pendleton Act of 1883 allowed for this type of pay schedule, but the modern version of the schedule emerged in the 1940s and was refined in the 1990s. The modern General Schedule includes fifteen grades, each with ten steps (Table 15.1). The grades reflect the different required competencies, education standards, skills, and experiences for the various civil service positions. Grades GS-1 and GS-2 require very little education, experience, and skills and pay little. Grades GS-3 through GS-7 and GS-8 through GS-12 require ascending levels of education and pay increasingly more. Grades GS-13 through GS-15 require specific, specialized experience and education, and these job levels pay the most. When hired into a position at a specific grade, employees are typically paid at the first step of that grade, the lowest allowable pay. Over time, assuming they receive satisfactory assessment ratings, they will progress through the various levels. Many careers allow for the civil servants to ascend through the grades of the specific career as well.21
公务员的薪酬依据美国联邦公务员薪酬表（US Federal General Schedule）发放。 薪酬表是一张图表，纵轴显示不同职位级别（职级）的薪资范围，横轴显示不同资历等级（阶数）的薪资范围。1883 年的《彭德尔顿法案》（Pendleton Act）允许采用这种薪酬表，但现代版本的薪酬表出现于 20 世纪 40 年代，并在 90 年代进行了完善。现代联邦公务员薪酬表包含 15 个职级，每个职级又分为 10 个阶数（ 表 15.1 ）。职级反映了不同公务员职位所需的各种能力、教育标准、技能和经验。GS-1 和 GS-2 职级对教育、经验和技能的要求很低，薪酬也较低。GS-3 至 GS-7 职级以及 GS-8 至 GS-12 职级对教育水平的要求逐渐提高，薪酬也相应增加。GS-13 至 GS-15 职级需要特定的专业经验和教育背景，这些职级的薪酬最高。员工被聘用到特定职级时，通常从该职级的第一级开始领取薪水，即最低工资。随着时间的推移，如果他们的考核评级令人满意，他们将逐步晋升到更高的职级。许多公务员职业也允许他们在该职业的不同职级之间晋升 。21

The intention behind these hiring practices and structured pay systems is to create an environment in which those most likely to succeed are in fact those who are ultimately appointed. The systems almost naturally result in organizations composed of experts who dedicate their lives to their work and their agency. Equally important, however, are the drawbacks. The primary one is that permanent employees can become too independent of the elected leaders. While a degree of separation is intentional and desired, too much can result in bureaucracies that are insufficiently responsive to political change. Another downside is that the accepted expertise of individual bureaucrats can sometimes hide their own chauvinistic impulses. The merit system encouraged bureaucrats to turn to each other and their bureaucracies for support and stability. Severing the political ties common in the spoils system creates the potential for bureaucrats to steer actions toward their own preferences even if these contradict the designs of elected leaders.

这些招聘方式和结构化薪酬体系背后的意图是创造一种环境，使最有可能成功的人最终获得任命。这些体系几乎自然而然地造就了由专家组成的组织，他们将毕生精力投入到工作和事业中。然而，同样重要的是，这些体系也存在弊端。首要的弊端是，正式员工可能会变得过于独立于民选领导人。虽然一定程度的分离是有意为之且必要的，但分离过度会导致官僚机构对政治变革反应不足。另一个缺点是，公认官员的专业能力有时会掩盖其自身的沙文主义倾向。精英制度鼓励官员们相互依靠，并寻求官僚机构的支持和稳定。切断分赃制中常见的政治联系，会使官员有可能将行动导向自身偏好，即使这些偏好与民选领导人的意愿相悖。
