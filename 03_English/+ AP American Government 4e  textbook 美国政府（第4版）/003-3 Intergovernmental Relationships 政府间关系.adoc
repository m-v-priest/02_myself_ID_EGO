== 释义



The national government’s ability to achieve its objectives often requires the participation of state and local governments. Intergovernmental grants offer positive financial inducements to get states to work toward selected national goals. A grant is commonly likened to a “carrot” to the extent that it is designed to entice the recipient to do something. On the other hand, unfunded mandates impose federal requirements on state and local authorities. Mandates are typically backed by the threat of penalties for non-compliance and provide little to no compensation for the costs of implementation. Thus, given its coercive nature, a mandate is commonly likened to a “stick.”

国家政府实现其目标的能力, 往往需要州和地方政府的参与。政府间拨款, 提供积极的财政激励，促使各州为实现既定的国家目标而努力。拨款通常被比作“胡萝卜”，因为它旨在诱使受助方采取某些行动。另一方面，无资金支持的强制性规定, 则是对州和地方当局施加联邦要求。强制性规定通常以"不遵守规定的处罚"相威胁，并且几乎不提供任何"实施成本"补偿。因此，鉴于其强制性，强制性规定, 通常被比作“大棒”。

拨款


The national government has used grants to influence state actions as far back as the Articles of Confederation when it provided states with land grants. In the first half of the 1800s, land grants were the primary means by which the federal government supported the states. Millions of acres of federal land were donated to support road, railroad, bridge, and canal construction projects, all of which were instrumental in piecing together a national transportation system to facilitate migration, interstate commerce, postal mail service, and movement of military people and equipment. Numerous universities and colleges across the country, such as Oklahoma State University and President Biden's alma mater, the University of Delaware, are land-grant institutions because their campuses were built on land donated by the federal government or by using funding secured by the sale of donated federal land. In the segregated South, black land grant universities were established in 1890, including Florida A&M University and Prairie View A&M University (Texas). At the turn of the twentieth century, cash grants replaced land grants as the main form of federal intergovernmental transfers and have become a central part of modern federalism.

[.my2]
早在 《邦联条例》 时期，联邦政府就通过向各州提供"土地赠与", 来影响各州的行动。**19 世纪上半叶，"土地赠与"是联邦政府支持各州的主要手段。数百万英亩的联邦土地被捐赠出来，用于支持公路、铁路、桥梁和运河的建设项目.**这些项目, 对于构建国家交通运输系统至关重要，从而促进了人口迁移、州际贸易、邮政服务, 以及军事人员和装备的调动。全国各地众多大学和学院，例如俄克拉荷马州立大学, 和拜登总统的母校特拉华大学，都是"被赠地大学"，因为它们的校园建在"联邦政府捐赠的土地"上，或利用"出售'捐赠的联邦土地'所得的资金"建造。在种族隔离的南方，黑人"赠地大学"于 1890 年建立，其中包括佛罗里达农工大学, 和德克萨斯州普雷里维尤农工大学。  在二十世纪之交，"现金补助"取代"土地补助", 成为联邦政府间"转移支付"的主要形式，并成为"现代联邦制"的核心组成部分 。

Federal cash grants do come with strings attached; the national government has an interest in seeing that public monies are used for policy activities that advance national objectives. Categorical grants are federal transfers formulated to limit recipients’ discretion in the use of funds and subject them to strict administrative criteria that guide project selection, performance, and financial oversight, among other things. These grants also often require some commitment of matching funds. Medicaid and the food stamp program are examples of categorical grants. Block grants come with less stringent federal administrative conditions and provide recipients more flexibility over how to spend grant funds. Examples of block grants include the Workforce Investment Act program, which provides state and local agencies money to help youths and adults obtain skill sets that will lead to better-paying jobs, and the Surface Transportation Program, which helps state and local governments maintain and improve highways, bridges, tunnels, sidewalks, and bicycle paths. Finally, recipients of general revenue sharing faced the least restrictions on the use of federal grants. From 1972 to 1986, when revenue sharing was abolished, upwards of $85 billion of federal money was distributed to states, cities, counties, towns, and villages.

联邦现金拨款, 确实附带了一些条件；联邦政府希望确保"公共资金"用于"推动国家目标的政策"活动。专项拨款是一种联邦转移支付，其制定目的是"限制受助者对资金使用的自由裁量权"，并使其遵守严格的行政标准，这些标准, 指导着项目选择、绩效和财务监督等方面。这些拨款通常还要求"受助者承诺提供一定数额的配套资金"。医疗补助计划和食品券计划, 就是"专项拨款"的例子。整笔拨款附带的联邦行政条件, 较为宽松，让受助者在如何使用拨款资金方面, 拥有更大的灵活性。整笔拨款的例子包括《劳动力投资法案》项目 —— 该项目为州和地方机构提供资金，帮助青年和成年人获得能找到薪资更高工作的技能；以及表面运输项目 —— 该项目帮助州和地方政府维护和改善高速公路、桥梁、隧道、人行道和自行车道。最后，一般收入分成的受助者, 在使用联邦拨款方面受到的限制最少。从 1972 年到 1986 年（"收入分成制度"被废除时），超过 850 亿美元的联邦资金, 被分配给了各州、市、县、镇和村。

During the 1960s and 1970s, funding for federal grants grew significantly, as the graphic shows in Figure 3.13. Growth picked up again in the 1990s and 2000s. The increase since the 1990s is primarily due to the increase in federal grant money going to Medicaid. Federally funded health-care programs jumped from $43.8 billion in 1990 to $320 billion in 2014. Health-related grant programs such as Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) represented more than half of total federal grant expenses.

[.my2]
如图 3.13 所示，20 世纪 60 年代和 70 年代, 联邦拨款显著增长。90 年代和 21 世纪初，增长势头再次加快。90 年代以来的增长, 主要归功于联邦对"医疗补助计划" (Medicaid) 拨款的增加。联邦政府资助的"医疗保健项目", 从 1990 年的 438 亿美元, 跃升至 2014 年的 3200 亿美元。  医疗补助计划 (Medicaid) 和儿童健康保险计划 (CHIP) 等与健康相关的拨款项目, 占联邦拨款总支出的一半以上。

These two graphs show the federal grants to the state and local government from 1960–2018. The first graph in the shape of a thermometer shows the increase of federal grants to state and local governments over time from 1960 to 2023, with these years and amounts: 1960 $7 billion, 1970 $24 billion, 1980 $91 billion, 1990 $135 billion, 2000 $286 billion, 2005 $428 billion, 2010 $608 billion, 2017 $674 billion, 2020 $879 billion, 2023 $1.083 trillion . The pie chart next to this graph shows the breakdown of the 2023 Federal grant of 1.083 trillion dollars. Health received 60%, income security received 15.4%, transportation received 8.1%, Education, training, employment and social services received 8.6%, community and regional development received 3.5%. Other departments had received around 3.1%.

[.my2]
这两张图表展示了 1960 年至 2018 年联邦政府对州和地方政府的拨款情况。第一张形似温度计的图表显示了 1960 年至 2023 年期间联邦对州和地方政府拨款的增长情况，涉及的年份及金额如下：1960 年为 70 亿美元，1970 年为 240 亿美元，1980 年为 910 亿美元，1990 年为 1350 亿美元，2000 年为 2860 亿美元，2005 年为 4280 亿美元，2010 年为 6080 亿美元，2017 年为 6740 亿美元，2020 年为 8790 亿美元，2023 年为 1.083 万亿美元。该图表旁边的饼图显示了 2023 年 1.083 万亿美元联邦拨款的具体分配情况。其中，医疗领域占 60%，收入保障占 15.4%，交通占 8.1%，教育、培训、就业及社会服务占 8.6%，社区和区域发展占 3.5%，其他部门约占 3.1%。

联邦政府, 利用拨款和其他手段, 来实现其"国家政策优先事项"。请访问“ 国家优先事项项目” 了解更多信息。

The national government has greatly preferred using categorical grants to transfer funds to state and local authorities because this type of grant gives them more control and discretion in how the money is spent. In 2014, the federal government distributed 1,099 grants, 1,078 of which were categorical, while only 21 were block grants. In response to the terrorist attack on the United States on September 11, 2001, more than a dozen new federal grant programs relating to homeland security were created, but as of 2011, only three were block grants.

[.my2]
联邦政府更倾向于使用"专项拨款", 向州和地方政府转移资金，因为这种拨款方式, 赋予它们更大的资金使用控制权和自主权。2014 年，联邦政府发放了 1099 笔拨款，其中 1078 笔为"专项拨款"，而"整笔拨款"仅有 21 笔。  为应对 2001 年 9 月 11 日美国遭受的恐怖袭击，联邦政府设立了十几个与"国土安全"相关的新拨款项目，但截至 2011 年，其中只有三个是"整笔拨款"。

There are a couple of reasons that categorical grants are more popular than block grants despite calls to decentralize public policy. One reason is that elected officials who sponsor these grants can take credit for their positive outcomes (e.g., clean rivers, better-performing schools, healthier children, a secure homeland) since elected officials, not state officials, formulate the administrative standards that lead to the results. Another reason is that categorical grants afford federal officials greater command over grant program performance. A common criticism leveled against block grants is that they lack mechanisms to hold state and local administrators accountable for outcomes, a reproach the Obama administration made about the Community Services Block Grant program. Finally, once categorical grants have been established, vested interests in Congress and the federal bureaucracy seek to preserve them. The legislators who enact them and the federal agencies that implement them invest heavily in defending them, ensuring their continuation.

[.my2]
尽管有人呼吁公共政策权力下放，但**"专项拨款"比"整笔拨款"更受欢迎，**原因有二。其一，发起这些拨款的民选官员, 可以因其带来的积极成果（例如，河流清洁、学校办学水平提高、儿童健康、国土安全）而邀功，**因为制定这些成果的行政标准的, 是民选官员，而非"州政府官员"。**其二，##**"专项拨款"使联邦官员, 能够更好地掌控"拨款项目"的执行情况。"整笔拨款"常被诟病的一点, 是缺乏机制来追究州和地方行政人员对成果的责任，**##奥巴马政府也曾对社区服务"整笔拨款项目"提出过类似的批评。最后，一旦"专项拨款制度"建立起来，国会和联邦官僚机构中的既得利益者, 就会竭力维护它。制定这些拨款的立法者, 和执行这些拨款的联邦机构, 会投入大量资源来捍卫它们，确保其得以延续。

Reagan’s “devolution revolution” contributed to raising the number of block grants from six in 1981 to fourteen in 1989. Block grants increased to twenty-four in 1999 during the Clinton administration and to twenty-six during Obama’s presidency, but by 2014 the total had dropped to twenty-one, accounting for 10 percent of total federal grant outlay. President Trump proposed eliminating four discretionary block grants in his "skinny" budget, although the budget was not passed.

[.my2]
里根的“权力下放革命”, 促使"联邦拨款"项目数量, 从 1981 年的 6 项, 增加到 1989 年的 14 项。克林顿执政期间，拨款项目数量, 在 1999 年增至 24 项，奥巴马执政期间, 增至 26 项，但到 2014 年，总数已降至 21 项，仅占"联邦拨款"总额的 10%。  特朗普总统在其“精简版”预算中, 提议取消四项可自由支配的拨款项目，但该预算最终未获通过。

In 1994, the Republican-controlled Congress passed legislation that called for block-granting Medicaid, which would have capped federal Medicaid spending. President Clinton vetoed the legislation. However, congressional efforts to convert Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) to a block grant succeeded. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant replaced the AFDC in 1996, marking the first time the federal government transformed an entitlement program (which guarantees individual rights to benefits) into a block grant. Under the AFDC, the federal government had reimbursed states a portion of the costs they bore for running the program without placing a ceiling on the amount. In contrast, the TANF block grant caps annual federal funding at $16.489 billion and provides a yearly lump sum to each state, which it can use to manage its own program.

[.my2]
1994 年，共和党控制的国会通过了一项法案，要求将"医疗补助计划"（Medicaid）改为"整笔拨款"，这将限制联邦政府的医疗补助支出。克林顿总统否决了这项法案。然而，国会成功地将 “援助有子女家庭计划”（AFDC）改为整笔拨款。1996 年，“ 贫困家庭临时援助计划”（TANF）整笔拨款, 取代了 AFDC，这标志着联邦政府首次将一项保障个人福利权利的福利项目, 转变为整笔拨款。在 AFDC 制度下，联邦政府会向各州报销一部分运营成本，但并未设定报销金额上限。相比之下，TANF 整笔拨款, 将联邦"年度拨款上限"设定为 164.89 亿美元，并向各州提供一笔年度固定拨款，供各州自行管理其项目。

Block grants have been championed for their cost-cutting effects. By eliminating uncapped federal funding, as the TANF issue illustrates, the national government can reverse the escalating costs of federal grant programs. This point was not lost on Paul Ryan (R-WI), former chair of the House Budget Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee, who, during his tenure as Speaker of the House from October 2015 to January 2019, tried multiple times but without success to convert Medicaid into a block grant, a reform he estimated could save the federal government upwards of $732 billion over ten years.

[.my2]
拨款制因其削减成本的效果, 而备受推崇。正如“临时援助贫困家庭计划”（TANF）所揭示的那样，通过取消无上限的联邦拨款，联邦政府可以扭转"联邦拨款项目成本不断攀升"的局面。这一点并没有被"众议院预算委员会"和"筹款委员会"前主席保罗· 瑞安 （威斯康星州共和党籍）忽视。在他 2015 年 10 月至 2019 年 1 月担任众议院议长期间，他曾多次尝试将"医疗补助计划"（Medicaid）改为"拨款制"，但均未成功。他估计，这项改革可以在十年内, 为联邦政府节省高达 7320 亿美元。

Another noteworthy characteristic of block grants is that their flexibility has been undermined over time as a result of creeping categorization, a process in which the national government places new administrative requirements on state and local governments or supplants block grants with new categorical grants. Among the more common measures used to restrict block grants’ programmatic flexibility are set-asides (i.e., requiring a certain share of grant funds to be designated for a specific purpose) and cost ceilings (i.e., placing a cap on funding other purposes).

[.my2]
"整笔拨款"的另一个显著特点是，由于 “分类渐进式 ”拨款制度的推移，其灵活性逐渐受到削弱 。 所谓“分类渐进式”拨款制度，是指联邦政府对州和地方政府, 施加新的行政要求，或以新的"专项拨款", 取代"整笔拨款"。 限制"整笔拨款"项目灵活性的常见措施包括, 预留资金（即要求将一定比例的拨款, 指定用于特定用途）, 和成本上限（即对其他用途的拨款, 设定上限）。

=== UNFUNDED MANDATES


[.my2]
未获资金支持的任务


Unfunded mandates are federal laws and regulations that impose obligations on state and local governments without fully compensating them for the administrative costs they incur. The federal government has used mandates increasingly since the 1960s to promote national objectives in policy areas such as the environment, civil rights, education, and homeland security. One type of mandate threatens civil and criminal penalties for state and local authorities that fail to comply with them across the board in all programs, while another provides for the suspension of federal grant money if the mandate is not followed. These types of mandates are commonly referred to as crosscutting mandates. Failure to fully comply with crosscutting mandates can result in punishments that normally include reduction of or suspension of federal grants, prosecution of officials, fines, or some combination of these penalties. If only one requirement is not met, state or local governments may not get any money at all.

[.my2]
无资金支持的"强制性规定", 是指联邦法律法规, 对州和地方政府施加义务，但并未对其产生的行政成本, 给予充分补偿。自 20 世纪 60 年代以来，联邦政府越来越多地利用"强制性规定"来推进环境、民权、教育和国土安全等政策领域的国家目标。**其中一种"强制性规定", 威胁要对未能全面遵守规定的州和地方政府, 处以民事和刑事处罚. 而另一种规定则规定，如果不遵守该规定，"联邦拨款"将被暂停。**这类"强制性规定"通常被称为"跨领域强制性规定"。**未能完全遵守"跨领域强制性规定", 可能导致的处罚通常包括: 减少或暂停联邦拨款、起诉官员、罚款或上述处罚的组合。**如果仅一项要求未得到满足，州或地方政府可能根本无法获得任何资金。

For example, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorizes the federal government to withhold federal grants as well as file lawsuits against state and local officials for practicing racial discrimination. Finally, some mandates come in the form of partial preemption regulations, whereby the federal government sets national regulatory standards but delegates the enforcement to state and local governments. For example, the Clean Air Act sets air quality regulations but instructs states to design implementation plans to achieve such standards (Figure 3.14).

[.my2]
例如，1964 年 《民权法案》 第六章, 授权联邦政府扣留联邦拨款，并对存在种族歧视行为的州和地方官员提起诉讼。此外，**一些强制性规定, 以"部分优先权法规"的形式出现，即联邦政府制定国家监管标准，但将执行权, 委托给州和地方政府。**例如，《 清洁空气法》 制定了空气质量法规，但指示各州制定实施计划, 以实现这些标准（ 图 3.14 ）。


Figure 3.14 The Clean Air Act is an example of an unfunded mandate. The Environmental Protection Agency sets federal standards regarding air and water quality, but it is up to each state to implement plans to achieve these standards.

[.my2]
图 3.14 《清洁空气法》就是一个缺乏资金支持的"强制性规定"的例子。"环境保护署"制定了关于空气和水质的联邦标准，但各州需要自行制定计划, 来实现这些标准。


The widespread use of federal mandates in the 1970s and 1980s provoked a backlash among state and local authorities, which culminated in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) in 1995. The UMRA’s main objective has been to restrain the national government’s use of mandates by subjecting rules that impose unfunded requirements on state and local governments to greater procedural scrutiny. However, since the act’s implementation, states and local authorities have obtained limited relief. A subsequent piece of legislation aimed to take this approach further. The 2017 Unfunded Mandates and Information Transparency Act, HR 50, passed the House in July 2018 before being referred to the Senate, where it was placed on the legislative calendar but moved no further.

[.my2]
20 世纪 70 年代和 80 年代，联邦政府"强制令"的广泛使用, 引发了州和地方政府的强烈反对，最终促成了 1995 年《 无资金授权改革法案 》（UMRA）的出台。UMRA 的主要目标, 是通过对那些对州和地方政府施加无资金要求的规则, 进行更严格的程序审查，来限制联邦政府"强制令"的使用。然而，自该法案实施以来，州和地方政府获得的救济有限。随后的一项立法, 旨在进一步推进这一做法。2017 年《无资金授权和信息透明法案》（HR 50）于 2018 年 7 月在众议院获得通过，随后被提交参议院，并被列入立法议程，但之后便没有进展。

The number of mandates has continued to rise, and some have been especially costly to states and local authorities. Consider the Real ID Act of 2005, a federal law designed to beef up homeland security. The law requires driver’s licenses and state-issued identification cards (DL/IDs) to contain standardized anti-fraud security features, specific data, and machine-readable technology. It also requires states to verify the identity of everyone being reissued DL/IDs. The Department of Homeland Security announced a phased enforcement of the law in 2013, which required individuals to present compliant DL/IDs to board commercial airlines starting in 2016. The cost to states of re-issuing DL/IDs, implementing new identity verification procedures, and redesigning DL/IDs is estimated to be $11 billion, and the federal government stands to reimburse only a small fraction. Compliance with the federal law has been onerous for many states; numerous extensions to states have been granted since 2016 and only thirty-eight were in full compliance with Real ID as of December 2018. Ultimately, all fifty states and the District of Columbia were certified as compliant.

[.my2]
强制性规定的数量持续增加，其中一些规定, 给州和地方政府带来了特别沉重的负担。以 2005 年的 《真实身份法案》（Real ID Act） 为例，这是一项旨在加强"国土安全"的联邦法律。该法案要求驾驶执照, 和州政府颁发的身份证（驾照/身份证）, 必须包含标准化的防欺诈安全功能、特定数据和机器可读技术。它还要求各州核实所有重新发放驾照/身份证的人员的身份。国土安全部于 2013 年宣布, 分阶段实施该法案，要求个人从 2016 年开始登机时, 必须出示符合规定的驾照/身份证。据估计，各州重新发放驾照/身份证、实施新的身份验证程序, 以及重新设计驾照/身份证的成本, 高达 110 亿美元，而联邦政府只能报销其中一小部分。  对许多州来说，遵守联邦法律是一项繁重的任务；自 2016 年以来，各州多次获得延期，但截至 2018 年 12 月，只有 38 个州完全符合 Real ID 标准 。 最终，所有 50 个州和哥伦比亚特区, 均被认证为符合标准。

The continued use of unfunded mandates clearly contradicts new federalism’s call for giving states and local governments more flexibility in carrying out national goals. The temptation to use them appears to be difficult for the federal government to resist, however, as the UMRA’s poor track record illustrates. This is because mandates allow the federal government to fulfill its national priorities while passing most of the cost to the states, an especially attractive strategy for national lawmakers trying to cut federal spending. Some leading federalism scholars have used the term coercive federalism to capture this aspect of contemporary U.S. federalism. In other words, Washington has been as likely to use the stick of mandates as the carrot of grants to accomplish its national objectives. As a result, there have been more instances of confrontational interactions between the states and the federal government.

[.my2]
继续使用无资金支持的强制性规定, 显然与"新联邦主义"呼吁"赋予州和地方政府更多灵活性, 以实现国家目标"的理念相悖。然而，正如《统一管理改革法案》（UMRA）糟糕的记录所表明的那样，联邦政府似乎难以抵挡使用此类规定的诱惑。这是因为, **"强制性规定"允许联邦政府在实现其"国家优先事项"的同时，将大部分成本转嫁给各州，这对试图削减联邦开支的联邦立法者来说, 尤其具有吸引力。**一些联邦主义领域的权威学者用 “强制性联邦主义” 一词, 来概括当代美国联邦主义的这一特点。 **换句话说 ，华盛顿在实现其"国家目标"时，既可能使用"强制性规定"的“大棒”，也可能使用"拨款"的“胡萝卜”。**因此，各州与联邦政府之间的对抗性互动, 也越来越多。
