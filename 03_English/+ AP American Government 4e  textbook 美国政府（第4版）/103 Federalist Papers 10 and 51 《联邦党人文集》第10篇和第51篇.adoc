To the People of the State of New York:
致纽约州人民：

AMONG the numerous advantages promised by a well-constructed Union, none deserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of faction. The friend of popular governments never finds himself so much alarmed for their character and fate, as when he contemplates their propensity to this dangerous vice. He will not fail, therefore, to set a due value on any plan which, without violating the principles to which he is attached, provides a proper cure for it. The instability, injustice, and confusion introduced into the public councils, have, in truth, been the mortal diseases under which popular governments have everywhere perished; as they continue to be the favorite and fruitful topics from which the adversaries to liberty derive their most specious declamations. The valuable improvements made by the American constitutions on the popular models, both ancient and modern, cannot certainly be too much admired; but it would be an unwarrantable partiality, to contend that they have as effectually obviated the danger on this side, as was wished and expected. Complaints are everywhere heard from our most considerate and virtuous citizens, equally the friends of public and private faith, and of public and personal liberty, that our governments are too unstable, that the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties, and that measures are too often decided, not according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party, but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority. However anxiously we may wish that these complaints had no foundation, the evidence, of known facts will not permit us to deny that they are in some degree true. It will be found, indeed, on a candid review of our situation, that some of the distresses under which we labor have been erroneously charged on the operation of our governments; but it will be found, at the same time, that other causes will not alone account for many of our heaviest misfortunes; and, particularly, for that prevailing and increasing distrust of public engagements, and alarm for private rights, which are echoed from one end of the continent to the other. These must be chiefly, if not wholly, effects of the unsteadiness and injustice with which a factious spirit has tainted our public administrations.

[.my2]
在结构完善的联邦所带来的诸多优势中，最值得深入探讨的莫过于其遏制和控制派系暴力的能力。民选政府的支持者，每当想到其易受这种危险弊端的影响时，都会对其性质和命运深感忧虑。因此，任何既不违背其所秉持原则，又能有效解决这一问题的方案，都会受到他们的高度重视。事实上，公共机构中出现的动荡、不公和混乱，正是民选政府在各地走向灭亡的致命病根；而这些也一直是自由的敌人炮制其最似是而非的论调的素材。美国宪法在古代和现代民选模式的基础上所做的宝贵改进固然值得称道，但若认为这些改进已经像人们所期望的那样有效地消除了这一方面的危险，则未免过于偏袒。我们最体贴、最正直的公民，那些既信仰公共信仰又珍视私人信仰、既捍卫公共自由又捍卫个人自由的人，都在抱怨政府过于不稳定，公共利益在党派纷争中被忽视，政策制定往往并非依据正义原则和少数派的权利，而是由利益集团的强大力量左右。尽管我们多么希望这些抱怨毫无根据，但已知的事实证据却无法否认它们在某种程度上是真实的。 诚然，只要认真审视我们的处境，就会发现我们所遭受的一些苦难被错误地归咎于政府的运作；但与此同时，也会发现，其他原因并不能完全解释我们许多最严重的灾难；尤其是那种普遍存在的、日益加深的对公共承诺的不信任以及对私人权利的担忧，这种担忧在整个大陆上都引起了共鸣。这些必然主要是，甚至完全是由于派系斗争的阴暗面和不公正玷污了我们的公共行政部门所造成的后果。

By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.

[.my2]
我所说的派系，是指一些公民，无论其人数占全体公民的多数还是少数，他们团结起来，受到某种共同的激情或利益的驱使，这种激情或利益与公民的其他权利或社会的永久和整体利益相悖。

There are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction: the one, by removing its causes; the other, by controlling its effects.

[.my2]
消除派系纷争弊端有两种方法：一是消除其根源；二是控制其后果。

There are again two methods of removing the causes of faction: the one, by destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence; the other, by giving to every citizen the same opinions, the same passions, and the same interests.

[.my2]
消除派系根源的方法又有两种：一是摧毁派系生存所必需的自由；二是赋予每个公民相同的观点、相同的激情和相同的利益。

It could never be more truly said than of the first remedy, that it was worse than the disease. Liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an aliment without which it instantly expires. But it could not be less folly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because it nourishes faction, than it would be to wish the annihilation of air, which is essential to animal life, because it imparts to fire its destructive agency.

[.my2]
对于第一种补救措施，再也没有比这更贴切的说法了：它比疾病本身更糟糕。自由之于派系，犹如空气之于火焰，是派系赖以生存的必需品。然而，仅仅因为自由滋养了派系，就废除对政治生活至关重要的自由，这与仅仅因为空气赋予火焰破坏力，就想要消灭对动物生命至关重要的空气一样愚蠢。

The second expedient is as impracticable as the first would be unwise. As long as the reason of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty to exercise it, different opinions will be formed. As long as the connection subsists between his reason and his self-love, his opinions and his passions will have a reciprocal influence on each other; and the former will be objects to which the latter will attach themselves. The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of government. From the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results; and from the influence of these on the sentiments and views of the respective proprietors, ensues a division of the society into different interests and parties.

[.my2]
第二种权宜之计如同第一种权宜之计一样不切实际。只要人的理性仍然会犯错，并且人可以自由地运用理性，不同的观点就会形成。只要人的理性与自爱之间存在联系，人的观点和激情就会相互影响；前者会成为后者依附的对象。人类能力的多样性——财产权正是源于此——同样是利益统一的不可逾越的障碍。保护这些能力是政府的首要目标。保护不同且不平等的财产获取能力，必然导致不同程度和种类的财产的拥有；而这些财产对各自所有者的情感和观点的影响，又会导致社会分裂成不同的利益集团和派别。

The latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man; and we see them everywhere brought into different degrees of activity, according to the different circumstances of civil society. A zeal for different opinions concerning religion, concerning government, and many other points, as well of speculation as of practice; an attachment to different leaders ambitiously contending for pre-eminence and power; or to persons of other descriptions whose fortunes have been interesting to the human passions, have, in turn, divided mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual animosity, and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each other than to co-operate for their common good. So strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosities, that where no substantial occasion presents itself, the most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle their unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts. But the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society. Those who are creditors, and those who are debtors, fall under a like discrimination. A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a mercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests, grow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into different classes, actuated by different sentiments and views. The regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the principal task of modern legislation, and involves the spirit of party and faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the government.

[.my2]
因此，派系斗争的潜在根源就埋藏在人性之中；我们看到，在不同的公民社会环境中，这些根源以不同程度的活跃形式出现。人们对宗教、政府以及许多其他问题（无论是思辨还是实践）的不同观点的热衷；对那些野心勃勃、争夺首位和权力的领袖的依恋；或者对其他一些命运牵动人心的人物的依恋，反过来又将人类分裂成不同的派系，激起彼此间的敌意，使他们更倾向于互相骚扰和压迫，而不是为了共同利益而合作。人类这种相互敌视的倾向如此强烈，以至于即使没有实质性的导火索，最轻浮、最牵强的差别也足以点燃他们之间的敌意，引发最激烈的冲突。但是，派系斗争最常见、最持久的根源在于财产分配的不公。在社会中，拥有财产者和无财产者自古以来就形成了不同的利益群体。债权人和债务人也同样如此。在文明国家中，土地利益、制造业利益、商业利益、金融利益以及许多其他较小的利益群体，都必然会形成，并将人们划分为不同的阶级，这些阶级受不同的情感和观点驱动。对这些形形色色、相互交织的利益进行规制，构成了现代立法的主要任务，也使得党派之争渗透到政府日常运作的方方面面。

No man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity. With equal, nay with greater reason, a body of men are unfit to be both judges and parties at the same time; yet what are many of the most important acts of legislation, but so many judicial determinations, not indeed concerning the rights of single persons, but concerning the rights of large bodies of citizens? And what are the different classes of legislators but advocates and parties to the causes which they determine? Is a law proposed concerning private debts? It is a question to which the creditors are parties on one side and the debtors on the other. Justice ought to hold the balance between them. Yet the parties are, and must be, themselves the judges; and the most numerous party, or, in other words, the most powerful faction must be expected to prevail. Shall domestic manufactures be encouraged, and in what degree, by restrictions on foreign manufactures? are questions which would be differently decided by the landed and the manufacturing classes, and probably by neither with a sole regard to justice and the public good. The apportionment of taxes on the various descriptions of property is an act which seems to require the most exact impartiality; yet there is, perhaps, no legislative act in which greater opportunity and temptation are given to a predominant party to trample on the rules of justice. Every shilling with which they overburden the inferior number, is a shilling saved to their own pockets.

[.my2]
任何人都不应担任自己案件的法官，因为他的利益必然会使其判断产生偏差，甚至可能损害其正直品格。同样，甚至更有理由，一群人不适合同时担任法官和当事人；然而，许多最重要的立法行为，不正是大量的司法裁决吗？这些裁决并非关乎个人的权利，而是关乎广大公民的权利。不同阶层的立法者，不正是他们所裁决案件的倡导者和当事人吗？一项关于私人债务的法律提案出台了。这是一个债权人和债务人都身处其中的问题。正义应当在双方之间保持平衡。然而，当事人本身就是，也必须就是法官；人数最多的一方，或者说，最强大的派系，必然会胜出。是否应该通过限制外国制造业来鼓励国内制造业？如果应该，又该在何种程度上鼓励？这些问题，土地所有者阶级和制造业阶级会做出不同的决定，而且很可能双方都不会仅仅出于公正和公共利益的考虑。对各类财产进行税收分配，似乎需要绝对的公正；然而，或许没有任何一项立法行为，比这项行为更能给占主导地位的一方提供践踏正义原则的机会和诱惑。他们加重弱势群体负担的每一先令，都是他们自己省下的钱。

It is in vain to say that enlightened statesmen will be able to adjust these clashing interests, and render them all subservient to the public good. Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm. Nor, in many cases, can such an adjustment be made at all without taking into view indirect and remote considerations, which will rarely prevail over the immediate interest which one party may find in disregarding the rights of another or the good of the whole.

[.my2]
认为开明的政治家能够调和这些相互冲突的利益，并使之全部服从于公共利益，是徒劳的。开明的政治家并非总能掌舵。而且，在许多情况下，如果不考虑间接和长远的因素，这种调和根本无法实现，而这些因素很少能凌驾于一方可能为了眼前的利益而罔顾另一方的权利或整体利益之上。

The inference to which we are brought is, that the CAUSES of faction cannot be removed, and that relief is only to be sought in the means of controlling its EFFECTS.

[.my2]
由此我们得出的结论是，派系斗争的根源无法消除，只能通过控制其后果来寻求缓解。

If a faction consists of less than a majority, relief is supplied by the republican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its sinister views by regular vote. It may clog the administration, it may convulse the society; but it will be unable to execute and mask its violence under the forms of the Constitution. When a majority is included in a faction, the form of popular government, on the other hand, enables it to sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the public good and the rights of other citizens. To secure the public good and private rights against the danger of such a faction, and at the same time to preserve the spirit and the form of popular government, is then the great object to which our inquiries are directed. Let me add that it is the great desideratum by which this form of government can be rescued from the opprobrium under which it has so long labored, and be recommended to the esteem and adoption of mankind.

[.my2]
如果一个派系人数不足半数，共和原则便能提供保障，使多数派能够通过正常的投票来挫败其险恶用心。它或许会阻碍政府运作，或许会扰乱社会秩序，但它无法在宪法的掩护下实施和掩盖其暴力行径。然而，当一个派系包含多数派成员时，民选政府的形式便使其能够为了自身的统治激情或利益而牺牲公共利益和其他公民的权利。因此，保障公共利益和公民权利免受此类派系的威胁，同时维护民选政府的精神和形式，便是我们探究的重大目标。我还要补充一点，这也是将这种政府形式从长期以来遭受的谴责中拯救出来，并使其赢得世人的尊重和拥护的关键所在。

By what means is this object attainable? Evidently by one of two only. Either the existence of the same passion or interest in a majority at the same time must be prevented, or the majority, having such coexistent passion or interest, must be rendered, by their number and local situation, unable to concert and carry into effect schemes of oppression. If the impulse and the opportunity be suffered to coincide, we well know that neither moral nor religious motives can be relied on as an adequate control. They are not found to be such on the injustice and violence of individuals, and lose their efficacy in proportion to the number combined together, that is, in proportion as their efficacy becomes needful.

[.my2]
实现这一目标的途径是什么？显然只有两种。要么必须阻止多数人同时持有相同的激情或利益，要么必须凭借人数优势和所处环境，使持有这种激情或利益的多数人无法合谋实施压迫计划。我们深知，如果任由冲动与机会同时出现，那么道德或宗教动机都无法起到有效的制约作用。它们无法阻止个人的不公正和暴力行为，而且随着人数的增加，即随着其效力需求的增加，其效力也会相应减弱。

From this view of the subject it may be concluded that a pure democracy, by which I mean a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person, can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction. A common passion or interest will, in almost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole; a communication and concert result from the form of government itself; and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party or an obnoxious individual. Hence it is that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths. Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species of government, have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same time, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their opinions, and their passions.

[.my2]
从这个角度来看，我们可以得出结论：纯粹的民主政体——我指的是由少数公民组成，他们亲自集会并管理政府的社会——无法根除派系斗争的弊端。几乎在所有情况下，大多数人都会感受到共同的激情或利益；政府形式本身就导致了沟通与协调；而且没有任何机制能够阻止牺牲弱势一方或令人厌恶的个人。因此，这类民主政体历来都是动荡和纷争的场所；历来都与人身安全或财产权格格不入；而且通常寿命短暂，其灭亡也往往伴随着暴力。那些支持这种政体的理论家们错误地认为，只要人类在政治权利上完全平等，他们的财产、思想和情感也会随之完全平等和同化。

A republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of representation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises the cure for which we are seeking. Let us examine the points in which it varies from pure democracy, and we shall comprehend both the nature of the cure and the efficacy which it must derive from the Union.

[.my2]
我所说的共和国，指的是实行代议制的政府，它开辟了不同的前景，并有望解决我们所寻求的问题。让我们考察一下它与纯粹民主制的区别，我们就能理解这种解决方案的本质以及它必须从联邦中汲取的效力。

The two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic are: first, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a small number of citizens elected by the rest; secondly, the greater number of citizens, and greater sphere of country, over which the latter may be extended.

[.my2]
民主制和共和制之间的两大区别在于：第一，共和制政府将权力委托给少数由其他公民选举产生的公民；第二，共和制的公民人数更多，国家范围也更广。

The effect of the first difference is, on the one hand, to refine and enlarge the public views, by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country, and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations. Under such a regulation, it may well happen that the public voice, pronounced by the representatives of the people, will be more consonant to the public good than if pronounced by the people themselves, convened for the purpose. On the other hand, the effect may be inverted. Men of factious tempers, of local prejudices, or of sinister designs, may, by intrigue, by corruption, or by other means, first obtain the suffrages, and then betray the interests, of the people. The question resulting is, whether small or extensive republics are more favorable to the election of proper guardians of the public weal; and it is clearly decided in favor of the latter by two obvious considerations:
第一个区别一方面在于，通过由公民选举产生的代表机构来表达公众意见，可以提炼和拓展公众的观点。这些公民的智慧最能洞察国家的真正利益，他们的爱国情怀和对正义的追求也最不可能使国家利益屈从于暂时的或片面的考量。在这种制度下，由人民代表表达的公众意见，很可能比人民自己召集起来表达的意见更符合公共利益。另一方面，其效果也可能相反。一些心怀党派偏见、带有地方偏见或图谋不轨的人，可能通过阴谋、腐败或其他手段，先获得选举权，然后背叛人民的利益。由此产生的问题是：小共和国还是大共和国更有利于选出合适的公共福祉守护者？显而易见，后者更有利，原因有二：

In the first place, it is to be remarked that, however small the republic may be, the representatives must be raised to a certain number, in order to guard against the cabals of a few; and that, however large it may be, they must be limited to a certain number, in order to guard against the confusion of a multitude. Hence, the number of representatives in the two cases not being in proportion to that of the two constituents, and being proportionally greater in the small republic, it follows that, if the proportion of fit characters be not less in the large than in the small republic, the former will present a greater option, and consequently a greater probability of a fit choice.

[.my2]
首先需要指出的是，无论共和国多么小，代表人数都必须达到一定数量，以防止少数人串通起来；无论共和国多么大，代表人数都必须限制在一定数量，以防止民众意见分歧。因此，由于这两个共和国的代表人数与其组成国的人数不成比例，而且小共和国的代表人数比例更高，由此可见，如果大共和国的合格人才比例不低于小共和国，那么大共和国将提供更多选择，从而更有可能选出合适的人选。

In the next place, as each representative will be chosen by a greater number of citizens in the large than in the small republic, it will be more difficult for unworthy candidates to practice with success the vicious arts by which elections are too often carried; and the suffrages of the people being more free, will be more likely to centre in men who possess the most attractive merit and the most diffusive and established characters.

[.my2]
其次，由于大共和国的每位代表都将由比小共和国更多的公民选出，因此不称职的候选人将更难成功地运用选举中经常出现的卑劣手段；而且，由于人民的选举更加自由，因此更有可能集中在那些拥有最吸引人的才能和最广泛认可和稳固的品格的人身上。

It must be confessed that in this, as in most other cases, there is a mean, on both sides of which inconveniences will be found to lie. By enlarging too much the number of electors, you render the representatives too little acquainted with all their local circumstances and lesser interests; as by reducing it too much, you render him unduly attached to these, and too little fit to comprehend and pursue great and national objects. The federal Constitution forms a happy combination in this respect; the great and aggregate interests being referred to the national, the local and particular to the State legislatures.

[.my2]
必须承认，在这个问题上，如同在大多数其他问题上一样，存在一个中间地带，越过这个地带都会带来不便。如果选民人数过多，就会使代表们对当地情况和细微利益了解不足；如果选民人数过少，就会使代表们过于关注这些，而难以理解和追求宏大的国家目标。联邦宪法在这方面形成了一种巧妙的平衡：国家层面处理重大和总体利益，而州层面处理地方和具体事务。

The other point of difference is, the greater number of citizens and extent of territory which may be brought within the compass of republican than of democratic government; and it is this circumstance principally which renders factious combinations less to be dreaded in the former than in the latter. The smaller the society, the fewer probably will be the distinct parties and interests composing it; the fewer the distinct parties and interests, the more frequently will a majority be found of the same party; and the smaller the number of individuals composing a majority, and the smaller the compass within which they are placed, the more easily will they concert and execute their plans of oppression. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act in unison with each other. Besides other impediments, it may be remarked that, where there is a consciousness of unjust or dishonorable purposes, communication is always checked by distrust in proportion to the number whose concurrence is necessary.

[.my2]
另一个区别在于，共和政体比民主政体能够涵盖更多的公民和更广阔的领土；正是这一特点使得共和政体中的派系联合比民主政体中的派系联合更不令人担忧。社会规模越小，构成社会的不同党派和利益集团就越少；不同的党派和利益集团越少，就越容易出现同一党派占据多数的情况；而构成多数的人数越少，他们所处的范围越小，就越容易串通起来实施压迫计划。扩大范围，就能纳入更多种类的党派和利益集团；这样一来，大多数公民就更难拥有侵犯其他公民权利的共同动机；即便存在这种共同动机，所有持有这种动机的人也更难发现自身的力量，并彼此协调行动。除了其他障碍之外，还应该指出的是，当人们意识到存在不公正或不光彩的目的时，沟通总是会受到不信任的阻碍，这种阻碍与需要达成共识的人数成正比。

Hence, it clearly appears, that the same advantage which a republic has over a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by a large over a small republic,--is enjoyed by the Union over the States composing it. Does the advantage consist in the substitution of representatives whose enlightened views and virtuous sentiments render them superior to local prejudices and schemes of injustice? It will not be denied that the representation of the Union will be most likely to possess these requisite endowments. Does it consist in the greater security afforded by a greater variety of parties, against the event of any one party being able to outnumber and oppress the rest? In an equal degree does the increased variety of parties comprised within the Union, increase this security. Does it, in fine, consist in the greater obstacles opposed to the concert and accomplishment of the secret wishes of an unjust and interested majority? Here, again, the extent of the Union gives it the most palpable advantage.

[.my2]
因此，显而易见，共和制相对于民主制在控制派系影响方面所具有的优势，正如大共和国相对于小共和国所享有的优势一样，联邦相对于组成它的各州也享有同样的优势。这种优势是否在于联邦的代表拥有开明的思想和高尚的品德，使其能够超越地方偏见和不公正的阴谋？不可否认，联邦的代表最有可能具备这些必要的素质。这种优势是否在于，更多元化的政党能够提供更大的保障，防止任何一个政党凭借人数优势压制其他政党？同样，联邦内部政党的多元化也增强了这种保障。最终，这种优势是否在于，联邦能够提供更大的障碍，阻止不公正且别有用心的多数派达成秘密协议并实现其私利？在这方面，联邦的幅员辽阔同样赋予了它最显著的优势。

The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other States. A religious sect may degenerate into a political faction in a part of the Confederacy; but the variety of sects dispersed over the entire face of it must secure the national councils against any danger from that source. A rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any other improper or wicked project, will be less apt to pervade the whole body of the Union than a particular member of it; in the same proportion as such a malady is more likely to taint a particular county or district, than an entire State.

[.my2]
派系领袖的影响力或许能在其各自所在的州内点燃导火索，但却无法将战火蔓延至其他各州。一个宗教派别或许会在邦联的某个地区演变成政治派别；但遍布整个邦联的各种教派足以确保国家议会免受此类威胁。对纸币的狂热、对废除债务的诉求、对财产均分的主张，或其他任何不当或邪恶的计划，都不太可能像在某个特定州那样蔓延至整个联邦；正如这种弊病更有可能侵蚀某个县或地区，而不是整个州一样。

In the extent and proper structure of the Union, therefore, we behold a republican remedy for the diseases most incident to republican government. And according to the degree of pleasure and pride we feel in being republicans, ought to be our zeal in cherishing the spirit and supporting the character of Federalists.

[.my2]
因此，从联邦的规模和适当结构中，我们看到了共和政体中最常见的弊病的良方。我们作为共和主义者所感受到的喜悦和自豪程度，也应当决定我们维护联邦主义者精神和品格的热情。

To the People of the State of New York:
致纽约州人民：

TO WHAT expedient, then, shall we finally resort, for maintaining in practice the necessary partition of power among the several departments, as laid down in the Constitution? The only answer that can be given is, that as all these exterior provisions are found to be inadequate, the defect must be supplied, by so contriving the interior structure of the government as that its several constituent parts may, by their mutual relations, be the means of keeping each other in their proper places. Without presuming to undertake a full development of this important idea, I will hazard a few general observations, which may perhaps place it in a clearer light, and enable us to form a more correct judgment of the principles and structure of the government planned by the convention. In order to lay a due foundation for that separate and distinct exercise of the different powers of government, which to a certain extent is admitted on all hands to be essential to the preservation of liberty, it is evident that each department should have a will of its own; and consequently should be so constituted that the members of each should have as little agency as possible in the appointment of the members of the others. Were this principle rigorously adhered to, it would require that all the appointments for the supreme executive, legislative, and judiciary magistracies should be drawn from the same fountain of authority, the people, through channels having no communication whatever with one another. Perhaps such a plan of constructing the several departments would be less difficult in practice than it may in contemplation appear. Some difficulties, however, and some additional expense would attend the execution of it. Some deviations, therefore, from the principle must be admitted. In the constitution of the judiciary department in particular, it might be inexpedient to insist rigorously on the principle: first, because peculiar qualifications being essential in the members, the primary consideration ought to be to select that mode of choice which best secures these qualifications; secondly, because the permanent tenure by which the appointments are held in that department, must soon destroy all sense of dependence on the authority conferring them. It is equally evident, that the members of each department should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others, for the emoluments annexed to their offices. Were the executive magistrate, or the judges, not independent of the legislature in this particular, their independence in every other would be merely nominal. But the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department, consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others. The provision for defense must in this, as in all other cases, be made commensurate to the danger of attack. Ambition must be made to counteract ambition. The interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place. It may be a reflection on human nature, that such devices should be necessary to control the abuses of government. But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions. This policy of supplying, by opposite and rival interests, the defect of better motives, might be traced through the whole system of human affairs, private as well as public. We see it particularly displayed in all the subordinate distributions of power, where the constant aim is to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that each may be a check on the other that the private interest of every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights. These inventions of prudence cannot be less requisite in the distribution of the supreme powers of the State. But it is not possible to give to each department an equal power of self-defense. In republican government, the legislative authority necessarily predominates. The remedy for this inconveniency is to divide the legislature into different branches; and to render them, by different modes of election and different principles of action, as little connected with each other as the nature of their common functions and their common dependence on the society will admit. It may even be necessary to guard against dangerous encroachments by still further precautions. As the weight of the legislative authority requires that it should be thus divided, the weakness of the executive may require, on the other hand, that it should be fortified. An absolute negative on the legislature appears, at first view, to be the natural defense with which the executive magistrate should be armed. But perhaps it would be neither altogether safe nor alone sufficient. On ordinary occasions it might not be exerted with the requisite firmness, and on extraordinary occasions it might be perfidiously abused. May not this defect of an absolute negative be supplied by some qualified connection between this weaker department and the weaker branch of the stronger department, by which the latter may be led to support the constitutional rights of the former, without being too much detached from the rights of its own department? If the principles on which these observations are founded be just, as I persuade myself they are, and they be applied as a criterion to the several State constitutions, and to the federal Constitution it will be found that if the latter does not perfectly correspond with them, the former are infinitely less able to bear such a test. There are, moreover, two considerations particularly applicable to the federal system of America, which place that system in a very interesting point of view. First. In a single republic, all the power surrendered by the people is submitted to the administration of a single government; and the usurpations are guarded against by a division of the government into distinct and separate departments. In the compound republic of America, the power surrendered by the people is first divided between two distinct governments, and then the portion allotted to each subdivided among distinct and separate departments. Hence a double security arises to the rights of the people. The different governments will control each other, at the same time that each will be controlled by itself. Second. It is of great importance in a republic not only to guard the society against the oppression of its rulers, but to guard one part of the society against the injustice of the other part. Different interests necessarily exist in different classes of citizens. If a majority be united by a common interest, the rights of the minority will be insecure. There are but two methods of providing against this evil: the one by creating a will in the community independent of the majority that is, of the society itself; the other, by comprehending in the society so many separate descriptions of citizens as will render an unjust combination of a majority of the whole very improbable, if not impracticable. The first method prevails in all governments possessing an hereditary or self-appointed authority. This, at best, is but a precarious security; because a power independent of the society may as well espouse the unjust views of the major, as the rightful interests of the minor party, and may possibly be turned against both parties. The second method will be exemplified in the federal republic of the United States. Whilst all authority in it will be derived from and dependent on the society, the society itself will be broken into so many parts, interests, and classes of citizens, that the rights of individuals, or of the minority, will be in little danger from interested combinations of the majority. In a free government the security for civil rights must be the same as that for religious rights. It consists in the one case in the multiplicity of interests, and in the other in the multiplicity of sects. The degree of security in both cases will depend on the number of interests and sects; and this may be presumed to depend on the extent of country and number of people comprehended under the same government. This view of the subject must particularly recommend a proper federal system to all the sincere and considerate friends of republican government, since it shows that in exact proportion as the territory of the Union may be formed into more circumscribed Confederacies, or States oppressive combinations of a majority will be facilitated: the best security, under the republican forms, for the rights of every class of citizens, will be diminished: and consequently the stability and independence of some member of the government, the only other security, must be proportionately increased. Justice is the end of government. It is the end of civil society. It ever has been and ever will be pursued until it be obtained, or until liberty be lost in the pursuit. In a society under the forms of which the stronger faction can readily unite and oppress the weaker, anarchy may as truly be said to reign as in a state of nature, where the weaker individual is not secured against the violence of the stronger; and as, in the latter state, even the stronger individuals are prompted, by the uncertainty of their condition, to submit to a government which may protect the weak as well as themselves; so, in the former state, will the more powerful factions or parties be gradually induced, by a like motive, to wish for a government which will protect all parties, the weaker as well as the more powerful. It can be little doubted that if the State of Rhode Island was separated from the Confederacy and left to itself, the insecurity of rights under the popular form of government within such narrow limits would be displayed by such reiterated oppressions of factious majorities that some power altogether independent of the people would soon be called for by the voice of the very factions whose misrule had proved the necessity of it. In the extended republic of the United States, and among the great variety of interests, parties, and sects which it embraces, a coalition of a majority of the whole society could seldom take place on any other principles than those of justice and the general good; whilst there being thus less danger to a minor from the will of a major party, there must be less pretext, also, to provide for the security of the former, by introducing into the government a will not dependent on the latter, or, in other words, a will independent of the society itself. It is no less certain than it is important, notwithstanding the contrary opinions which have been entertained, that the larger the society, provided it lie within a practical sphere, the more duly capable it will be of self-government. And happily for the REPUBLICAN CAUSE, the practicable sphere may be carried to a very great extent, by a judicious modification and mixture of the FEDERAL PRINCIPLE.

那么，为了在实践中维持宪法规定的各部门之间必要的权力划分，我们最终应该采取何种权宜之计呢？唯一的答案是，既然所有这些外部规定都不足以弥补这一缺陷，就必须通过精心设计政府的内部结构来弥补，使各个组成部分能够通过相互关系，彼此制衡，各司其职。我不敢妄图对这一重要理念进行全面阐述，但愿能提出一些概括性的意见，或许能使之更加清晰，并有助于我们对制宪会议所设想的政府原则和结构做出更正确的判断。为了确保政府各部门权力的独立行使（这在一定程度上被公认为维护自由的必要条件），显然，每个部门都应该拥有自己的意志；因此，各部门的组成方式应当尽可能减少其成员在其他部门成员任命方面的干预。如果严格遵守这一原则，就意味着最高行政、立法和司法机构的所有任命都必须来自同一权力源泉——人民，且各部门之间没有任何沟通渠道。或许，这样的部门架构在实践中比设想中要容易得多。然而，执行起来仍然会遇到一些困难，并产生一些额外的费用。因此，我们必须承认，对这一原则的一些偏离是不可避免的。 尤其是在司法部门的组成中，严格坚持这一原则或许并不明智：首先，由于成员必须具备特殊资格，首要考虑的应该是选择最能确保这些资格的选拔方式；其次，因为该部门的任命采用永久任期制，必然会很快消除其对授予权力机构的依赖感。同样显而易见的是，各部门成员在薪酬方面应尽可能减少对其他部门成员的依赖。如果行政长官或法官在这一方面不能独立于立法机关，那么他们在其他所有方面的独立性都将只是名义上的。防止各部门权力逐渐集中于同一部门的最大保障在于，赋予各部门的管理者必要的宪法手段和个人动力，使其能够抵制其他部门的权力侵蚀。国防准备必须与遭受攻击的危险程度相称，这一点在所有其他情况下亦是如此。必须以野心制衡野心。个人的利益必须与所在之地的宪法权利相联系。为了控制政府的滥用权力，需要采取此类措施，这或许反映了人性的一面。但政府本身又是什么呢？它不正是对人性最深刻的体现吗？如果人是天使，就不需要政府。如果由天使来统治人，那么对政府的外部和内部制约都将不再必要。 在构建一个由人统治人的政府时，最大的困难在于：首先，必须使政府能够控制被统治者；其次，必须使其能够自我约束。毫无疑问，对人民的依赖是对政府的首要制约；但经验告诉人类，辅助性预防措施必不可少。这种通过相互对立和竞争的利益来弥补更高动机不足的策略，贯穿于整个人类事务体系，无论是私人事务还是公共事务。我们尤其能在各种权力分配中看到这一点，其始终的目标是划分和安排各个部门，使每个部门都能制衡其他部门，使每个人的私人利益都能成为公共权利的守护者。在分配国家最高权力时，这些审慎的举措同样必不可少。但是，不可能赋予每个部门同等的自卫权。在共和政体中，立法权必然占据主导地位。解决这一不便的办法是将立法机关划分为不同的分支；并通过不同的选举方式和不同的行事原则，使各分支之间的联系尽可能地减少，以符合它们共同职能的性质以及它们对社会的共同依赖性。甚至可能需要采取进一步的预防措施，以防止危险的侵蚀。鉴于立法权的分量要求将其如此划分，另一方面，行政权的薄弱可能要求对其进行加强。 乍看之下，对立法机关拥有绝对否决权似乎是行政长官理应拥有的天然防御手段。但这或许既不完全安全，也并非万无一失。在通常情况下，这种否决权可能无法得到充分的运用；而在特殊情况下，它又可能被恶意滥用。那么，能否通过在较弱的行政部门与较强的行政部门的较弱分支之间建立某种限定性的联系来弥补绝对否决权的不足呢？通过这种联系，后者既可以支持前者的宪法权利，又不会过于脱离自身部门的权利。如果这些观察所依据的原则是正确的（正如我所确信的那样），并且将它们作为标准应用于各州宪法和联邦宪法，就会发现，如果后者与这些原则不完全一致，那么前者就更难经受这样的考验。此外，还有两点特别适用于美国的联邦体制，这两点使该体制处于一个非常有趣的视角。第一点。在一个单一的共和国里，人民交出的所有权力都由一个政府管理；而政府的划分，即设立不同的独立部门，则是为了防止权力被篡夺。在美利坚的复合共和国里，人民交出的权力首先被分配给两个不同的政府，然后分配给每个政府的权力又被细分到不同的独立部门。因此，人民的权利得到了双重保障。不同的政府之间相互制约，同时每个政府也受到自身的制约。第二点。 在一个共和国里，不仅要保护社会免受统治者的压迫，还要保护社会的一部分免受另一部分人的不公正对待，这一点至关重要。不同阶层的公民必然存在不同的利益。如果多数人因共同利益而团结起来，少数人的权利就会得不到保障。防止这种弊端的方法只有两种：一是建立一种独立于多数人（即社会本身）的共同意志；二是使社会包含足够多的不同公民群体，从而使多数人联合起来进行不公正的斗争变得极不可能，甚至根本无法实现。第一种方法在所有拥有世袭或自封权力的政府中都普遍存在。但这充其量只是一种脆弱的保障；因为独立于社会的权力既可能拥护多数人的不公正观点，也可能维护少数人的正当利益，甚至有可能反过来对付双方。第二种方法将以美利坚联邦共和国为例进行说明。虽然一切权力都源于社会并依赖于社会，但社会本身又会分裂成众多部分、利益群体和公民阶层，因此个人或少数群体的权利几乎不会受到多数群体利益集团的威胁。在一个自由政府中，公民权利的保障必须与宗教权利的保障相同。前者体现在利益的多样性上，后者体现在教派的多样性上。 无论哪种情况，安全程度都取决于利益集团和派别的数量；而这又可以推断取决于同一政府管辖下的国土面积和人口数量。对于所有真诚而深思熟虑的共和政体支持者而言，这种观点尤其值得推荐一个合适的联邦制，因为它表明，联邦领土被分割成范围更小的邦联或州，越有利于多数派的压迫性联合，共和政体下各阶层公民权利的最佳保障就越会降低；因此，作为另一项保障的政府成员的稳定性和独立性，必须相应增强。正义是政府的最终目的，也是公民社会的最终目的。人们过去一直追求正义，将来也必将如此，直到正义得以实现，或者在追求正义的过程中失去自由为止。在一个强势派系可以轻易联合起来压迫弱小派系的社会里，可以说无政府状态如同自然状态一样盛行，在自然状态下，弱者无法免受强者的暴力侵害；正如在自然状态下，即使是强者也会因为自身处境的不确定性而被迫服从一个能够保护弱者和自身的政府一样，在前一种状态下，更强大的派系或政党也会逐渐受到类似的动机驱使，希望建立一个能够保护所有各方（包括弱者和强者）的政府。 毫无疑问，如果罗德岛州脱离邦联，独立运作，那么在如此狭隘的范围内，民选政府体制下权利的不安全感将因派系多数群体的反复压迫而暴露无遗，以至于那些因其统治不善而不得不寻求独立于人民的权力的派系很快就会发出这样的呼声。在幅员辽阔的美利坚共和国，在其所包含的众多利益集团、政党和教派中，大多数民众的联盟几乎不可能建立在正义和公共利益之外的其他原则之上；因此，少数群体受制于多数群体意志的威胁较小，也就更没有借口通过在政府中引入一种不依赖于多数群体意志，或者换句话说，一种独立于社会本身的意志，来保障少数群体的利益。尽管存在各种相反的观点，但有一点毋庸置疑且至关重要：只要社会规模在实际范围内，其自治能力就越强。而对共和党而言，幸运的是，通过对联邦原则进行审慎的修改和融合，实际范围可以扩展到非常大的程度。
