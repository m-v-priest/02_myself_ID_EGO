== 释义




The majority of elections in the United States are held to facilitate indirect democracy. Elections allow the people to pick representatives to serve in government and make decisions on the citizens’ behalf. Representatives pass laws, implement taxes, and carry out decisions. Although direct democracy had been used in some of the colonies, the framers of the Constitution granted voters no legislative or executive powers, because they feared the masses would make poor decisions and be susceptible to whims. During the Progressive Era, however, governments began granting citizens more direct political power. States that formed and joined the United States after the Civil War often assigned their citizens some methods of directly implementing laws or removing corrupt politicians. Citizens now use these powers at the ballot to change laws and direct public policy in their states.

美国的大多数选举都是为了促进间接民主而举行的。选举使人民能够选出代表在政府任职，并代表公民做出决策。代表们制定法律、征收税款并执行各项决定。尽管一些殖民地曾实行过直接民主，但宪法的制定者并未赋予选民任何立法权或行政权，因为他们担心民众会做出错误的决定，并且容易受情绪左右。然而，在进步时代，政府开始赋予公民更多直接的政治权力。内战后成立或加入美国的各州通常会赋予其公民一些直接执行法律或罢免腐败政客的途径。如今，公民可以通过投票来运用这些权力，改变法律并指导本州的公共政策。

DIRECT DEMOCRACY DEFINED
直接民主的定义
Direct democracy occurs when policy questions go directly to the voters for a decision. These decisions include funding, budgets, candidate removal, candidate approval, policy changes, and constitutional amendments. Not all states allow direct democracy, nor does the United States government.

[.my2]
直接民主是指政策问题直接交由选民决定。这些决定包括资金分配、预算、候选人罢免、候选人批准、政策变更和宪法修正案。并非所有州都允许直接民主，美国联邦政府也不允许。

Direct democracy takes many forms. It may occur locally or statewide. Local direct democracy allows citizens to propose and pass laws that affect local towns or counties. Towns in Massachusetts, for example, may choose to use town meetings, which is a meeting comprised of the town’s eligible voters, to make decisions on budgets, salaries, and local laws.122
直接民主的形式多种多样，既可以发生在地方层面，也可以发生在州层面。地方直接民主允许公民提出并通过影响当地城镇或县的法律。例如，马萨诸塞州的城镇可以选择召开镇民大会（由该镇的合格选民组成）来决定预算、薪资和地方法律 。122

Statewide direct democracy allows citizens to propose and pass laws that affect state constitutions, state budgets, and more. Most states in the western half of the country allow citizens all forms of direct democracy, while most states on the eastern and southern regions allow few or none of these forms (Figure 7.20). States that joined the United States after the Civil War are more likely to have direct democracy, possibly due to the influence of Progressives during the late 1800s and early 1900s. Progressives believed citizens should be more active in government and democracy, a hallmark of direct democracy.

全州范围内的直接民主允许公民提出并通过影响州宪法、州预算等方面的法律。美国西部的大多数州允许公民行使所有形式的直接民主，而东部和南部的大多数州则很少或根本不允许行使这些形式（ 图 7.20 ）。内战后加入美国的州更有可能实行直接民主，这可能是由于 19 世纪末 20 世纪初进步主义者的影响。进步主义者认为公民应该更积极地参与政府和民主进程，这正是直接民主的标志。

A map of the United States titled “Initiative and Popular Referendum Provisions by State, 2010”. The legend has five categories, “Referendum”, “Initiative”, “Both”, “Neither”, and “Ballot measures permitted in odd years”. These states are labeled “both”: WA, OR, CA, AK, ID, NV, MT, WY, UT, AZ, CO, ND, SD, NE OK, MO, AR, IL, MI, OH, ME, MA. These states are labeled “neither”: HI, KS, TX, MN, IA, LA, WI, IN, TN, AL, GA, NH, VT, NY, CT, RI, PA, NJ, DE, WV, VA, NC, SC. These states are labeled “referendum”: NM, KY, MD. These states are labeled “Initiative”: MS, FL. These states are also labeled “ballot measures permitted in odd years”: WA, CO, OH, MS, ME.

图 7.20 此地图显示哪些州允许公民将法律和修正案提交选民投票表决，以获得批准或废除。
There are three forms of direct democracy used in the United States. A referendum asks citizens to confirm or repeal a decision made by the government. A legislative referendum occurs when a legislature passes a law or a series of constitutional amendments and presents them to the voters to ratify with a yes or no vote. A judicial appointment to a state supreme court may require voters to confirm whether the judge should remain on the bench. Popular referendums occur when citizens petition to place a referendum on a ballot to repeal legislation enacted by their state government. This form of direct democracy gives citizens a limited amount of power, but it does not allow them to overhaul policy or circumvent the government.

[.my2]
美国采用三种直接民主形式。公民投票是指公民确认或废除政府的决定。立法投票是指立法机构通过一项法律或一系列宪法修正案，并将其提交选民以赞成或反对票予以批准。州最高法院的法官任命可能需要选民确认该法官是否应继续留任。民众投票是指公民请愿将废除州政府颁布的法律的公投提案提交选民表决。这种直接民主形式赋予公民有限的权力，但并不允许他们彻底改变政策或绕过政府。

The most common form of direct democracy is the initiative, or proposition. An initiative is normally a law or constitutional amendment proposed and passed by the citizens of a state. Initiatives completely bypass the legislatures and governor, but they are subject to review by the state courts if they are not consistent with the state or national constitution. The process to pass an initiative is not easy and varies from state to state. Most states require that a petitioner or the organizers supporting an initiative file paperwork with the state and include the proposed text of the initiative. This allows the state or local office to determine whether the measure is legal, as well as estimate the cost of implementing it. This approval may come at the beginning of the process or after organizers have collected signatures. The initiative may be reviewed by the state attorney general, as in Oregon’s procedures, or by another state official or office. In Utah, the lieutenant governor reviews measures to ensure they are constitutional.

[.my2]
直接民主最常见的形式是公民提案 。公民提案通常是指由州公民提出并通过的法律或宪法修正案。公民提案完全绕过立法机构和州长，但如果与州宪法或联邦宪法不符，则需接受州法院的审查。公民提案的通过过程并非易事，且因州而异。大多数州要求请愿人或支持公民提案的组织者向州政府提交文件，并附上提案的文本。这使得州或地方政府能够确定该措施是否合法，并估算实施成本。这种批准可能在流程开始时就做出，也可能在组织者收集到签名后做出。公民提案可能由州检察长审查（例如俄勒冈州的程序），也可能由其他州官员或机构审查。在犹他州，副州长负责审查各项措施，以确保其符合宪法。

Next, organizers gather registered voters’ signatures on a petition. The number of signatures required is often a percentage of the number of votes from a past election. In California, for example, the required numbers are 5 percent (law) and 8 percent (amendment) of the votes in the last gubernatorial election. This means through 2022, it will take 623,212 signatures to place a law on the ballot and 997,139 to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot.123
接下来，组织者会收集已登记选民的签名。所需的签名数量通常是上次选举得票数的百分比。例如，在加利福尼亚州，将一项法律提案提交选民投票需要 5%的签名，而将一项宪法修正案提交选民投票则需要 8%的签名。这意味着，到 2022 年，将一项法律提案提交选民投票需要 623,212 个签名，而将一项宪法修正案提交选民投票则需要 997,139 个签名。

Once the petition has enough signatures from registered voters, it is approved by a state agency or the secretary of state for placement on the ballot. Signatures are verified by the state or a county elections office to ensure the signatures are valid. If the petition is approved, the initiative is then placed on the next ballot, and the organization campaigns to voters.

[.my2]
一旦请愿书收集到足够多的注册选民签名，就会由州政府机构或州务卿批准列入选票。州或县选举办公室会对签名进行核实，以确保其有效性。如果请愿书获得批准，该提案就会被列入下一轮选票，之后相关组织会开展选民宣传活动。

While the process is relatively clear, each step can take a lot of time and effort. First, most states place a time limit on the signature collection period. Organizations may have only 150 days to collect signatures, as in California, or as long as two years, as in Arizona. For larger states, the time limit may pose a dilemma if the organization is trying to collect more than 500,000 signatures from registered voters. Second, the state may limit who may circulate the petition and collect signatures. Some states, like Colorado, restrict what a signature collector may earn, while Oregon bans payments to signature-collecting groups. And the minimum number of signatures required affects the number of ballot measures. California had twelve ballot measures on the 2020 general election ballot, because the state requires fewer signatures to get a constitutional amendment or initiative on the ballot than in a state like Oklahoma, where the number of required signatures is higher. In Oklahoma, the required numbers are almost double those of California—8 percent (law) and 15 percent (amendment) of the votes in the last gubernatorial election. California voters may also have an equally high number of local ballot initiatives. For example, a San Francisco voter in the 2016 election had a total of forty-two ballot measures to consider, seventeen at the state level and twenty-five at the city and county level.

[.my2]
虽然流程相对清晰，但每一步都可能耗费大量时间和精力。首先，大多数州都对签名收集期限设有时间限制。例如，加利福尼亚州规定组织只有150天的时间来收集签名，而亚利桑那州则允许长达两年的时间。对于人口较多的州来说，如果组织试图从注册选民中收集超过50万个签名，时间限制可能会成为一个难题。其次，各州可能会限制谁可以分发请愿书和收集签名。一些州，例如科罗拉多州，限制了签名收集者的收入，而俄勒冈州则禁止向签名收集团体支付报酬。此外，所需的最低签名数量也会影响投票提案的数量。加利福尼亚州在2020年大选中有12项投票提案，因为该州对宪法修正案或公民倡议所需的签名数量要求低于俄克拉荷马州等其他要求更高的州。在俄克拉荷马州，所需票数几乎是加利福尼亚州的两倍——在上届州长选举中，法案需要获得8%的选票，修正案需要获得15%的选票。加利福尼亚州的选民可能还要面对同样多的地方性投票提案。例如，2016年旧金山的选民总共需要考虑42项投票提案，其中17项是州级提案，25项是市县级提案。

Another consideration is that, as we’ve seen, voters in primaries are more ideological and more likely to research the issues. Measures that are complex or require a lot of research, such as a lend-lease bond or changes in the state’s eminent-domain language, may do better on a primary ballot. Measures that deal with social policy, such as laws preventing animal cruelty, may do better on a general election ballot, when more of the general population comes out to vote. Proponents for the amendments or laws will take this into consideration as they plan.

[.my2]
另一个需要考虑的因素是，正如我们所见，初选选民的意识形态倾向更强，也更倾向于深入研究相关议题。一些较为复杂或需要大量研究的提案，例如租赁债券或修改州征用权相关条款，在初选中可能更容易获得支持。而一些涉及社会政策的提案，例如禁止虐待动物的法律，在普选中可能更受欢迎，因为届时会有更多民众参与投票。这些修正案或法律的支持者在制定计划时会考虑到这一点。

Finally, the recall is one of the more unusual forms of direct democracy; it allows voters to decide whether to remove a government official from office. All states have ways to remove officials, but removal by voters is less common. The recall of California Governor Gray Davis in 2003 and his replacement by Arnold Schwarzenegger is perhaps one of the more famous such recalls. The 2012 attempt by voters in Wisconsin to recall Governor Scott Walker shows how contentious and expensive a recall can be. Walker spent over $60 million in the election to retain his seat.124
最后， 罢免是直接民主中较为罕见的形式之一；它允许选民决定是否罢免政府官员。所有州都有罢免官员的途径，但选民罢免并不常见。2003 年加州州长格雷·戴维斯被罢免，并由阿诺德·施瓦辛格接任，这或许是此类罢免中最著名的案例之一。2012 年威斯康星州选民试图罢免州长斯科特·沃克，这表明罢免可能引发多么大的争议 ， 耗资多么巨大。沃克在竞选中花费了超过 6000 万美元以保住他的席位。

POLICYMAKING THROUGH DIRECT DEMOCRACY
通过直接民主进行政策制定
Politicians are often unwilling to wade into highly political waters if they fear it will harm their chances for reelection. When a legislature refuses to act or change current policy, initiatives allow citizens to take part in the policy process and end the impasse. In Colorado, Amendment 64 allowed the recreational use of marijuana by adults, despite concerns that state law would then conflict with national law. Colorado and Washington’s legalization of recreational marijuana use started a trend, leading to more states adopting similar laws.

[.my2]
如果担心影响连任机会，政客们往往不愿涉足高度政治化的领域。当立法机构拒绝采取行动或改变现有政策时，公民倡议便能让公民参与政策制定过程，打破僵局。在科罗拉多州，尽管有人担心州法律会与联邦法律相冲突，但第64号修正案仍允许成年人娱乐性使用大麻。科罗拉多州和华盛顿州娱乐性大麻合法化开启了一股潮流，促使更多州效仿。

Finding a Middle Ground
寻找折衷方案
Too Much Democracy?  民主过度了吗？
How much direct democracy is too much? When citizens want one policy direction and government prefers another, who should prevail?
直接民主的程度应该如何界定？当公民希望采取一种政策方向，而政府倾向于另一种时，谁应该占上风？

Consider recent laws and decisions about marijuana. California was the first state to allow the use of medical marijuana, after the passage of Proposition 215 in 1996. Just a few years later, however, in Gonzales v. Raich (2005), the Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. government had the authority to criminalize the use of marijuana. In 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder said the federal government would not seek to prosecute patients using marijuana medically, citing limited resources and other priorities. Perhaps emboldened by the national government’s stance, Colorado voters approved recreational marijuana use in 2012. Since then, other states have followed. Forty-two states and the District of Columbia now have laws in place that legalize the use of marijuana to varying degrees. In a number of these cases, the decision was made by voters through initiatives and direct democracy (Figure 7.21).

[.my2]
回顾近期关于大麻的法律和裁决。加利福尼亚州是第一个允许使用医用大麻的州，这得益于 1996 年通过的 215 号提案。然而，仅仅几年后，在冈萨雷斯诉雷奇案 （2005 年）中，最高法院裁定美国联邦政府有权将使用大麻定为犯罪。2009 年，司法部长埃里克 ·霍尔德表示，联邦政府不会起诉使用医用大麻的患者，理由是资源有限以及其他优先事项。或许是受到联邦政府立场的鼓舞，科罗拉多州选民在 2012 年批准了娱乐用大麻合法化。此后，其他州也纷纷效仿。目前，已有 42 个州和哥伦比亚特区制定了不同程度的大麻合法化法律。在许多情况下，这项决定是由选民通过公民投票和直接民主的方式做出的（ 图 7.21 ）。

Figure 7.21 Caption: In 2014, Florida voters considered a proposed amendment to the Florida constitution that would allow doctors to recommend the use of marijuana for patient use. The ballot initiative received 58 percent of the vote, just short of the 60 percent required to pass in Florida.

[.my2]
图 7.21 说明：2014 年，佛罗里达州选民就一项拟议的佛罗里达州宪法修正案进行了投票，该修正案将允许医生建议患者使用大麻。该提案获得了 58% 的选票，略低于佛罗里达州通过所需的 60% 的门槛。
So where is the problem? First, while citizens of these states believe smoking or consuming marijuana should be legal, the U.S. government does not. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA), passed by Congress in 1970, declares marijuana a dangerous drug and makes its sale a prosecutable act. And despite Holder’s statement, a 2013 memo by James Cole, the deputy attorney general, reminded states that marijuana use is still illegal.125 But the federal government cannot enforce the CSA on its own; it relies on the states’ help. And while Congress has decided not to prosecute patients using marijuana for medical reasons, it has not waived the Justice Department’s right to prosecute recreational use.126
那么问题出在哪里呢？首先，虽然这些州的居民认为吸食或使用大麻应该合法，但美国政府并不这么认为。1970 年国会通过的《 管制物质法》 （CSA）将大麻列为危险药物，并规定销售大麻属于违法行为。尽管霍尔德发表了声明，但司法部副部长詹姆斯 ·科尔在 2013 年的一份备忘录中提醒各州，使用大麻仍然是非法的。 125 但联邦政府无法独自执行《管制物质法》，它需要依赖各州的协助。虽然国会已决定不对出于医疗目的使用大麻的患者提起诉讼，但并未放弃司法部对娱乐性使用大麻的行为提起诉讼的权利。 126

Direct democracy has placed the states and its citizens in an interesting position. States have a legal obligation to enforce state laws and the state constitution, yet they also must follow the laws of the United States. Citizens who use marijuana legally in their state are not using it legally in their country. This leads many to question whether direct democracy gives citizens too much power.

[.my2]
直接民主使各州及其公民处于一种有趣的境地。各州有法律义务执行州法律和州宪法，但同时也必须遵守美国联邦法律。在州内合法使用大麻的公民，在联邦层面使用大麻并不合法。这引发了许多人对直接民主是否赋予公民过大权力的质疑。

Is it a good idea to give citizens the power to pass laws? Or should this power be subjected to checks and balances, as legislative bills are? Why or why not?
赋予公民立​​法权是否明智？或者这种权力是否应该像立法议案一样受到制衡？为什么？

Direct democracy has drawbacks, however. One is that it requires more of voters. Instead of voting based on party, the voter is expected to read and become informed to make smart decisions. Initiatives can fundamentally change a constitution or raise taxes. Recalls remove politicians from office. These are not small decisions. Most citizens, however, do not have the time to perform a lot of research before voting. Given the high number of measures on some ballots, this may explain why many citizens simply skip ballot measures they do not understand. Direct democracy ballot items regularly earn fewer votes than the choice of a governor or president.

[.my2]
然而，直接民主也有其弊端。其中之一是它对选民提出了更高的要求。选民不再仅仅根据党派投票，而是需要阅读资料、了解情况，才能做出明智的决定。公民提案可以从根本上改变宪法或提高税收。罢免程序可以将政治人物从公职中罢免。这些都是重大的决定。然而，大多数公民在投票前并没有时间进行大量的研究。考虑到某些选票上的提案数量众多，这或许可以解释为什么许多公民会直接跳过他们不了解的提案。直接民主的选票项目通常获得的选票少于州长或总统的选举。

When citizens rely on television ads, initiative titles, or advice from others in determining how to vote, they can become confused and make the wrong decisions. In 2008, Californians voted on Proposition 8, titled “Eliminates Rights of Same-Sex Couples to Marry.” A yes vote meant a voter wanted to define marriage as only between a woman and man. Even though the information was clear and the law was one of the shortest in memory, many voters were confused. Some thought of the amendment as the same-sex marriage amendment. In short, some people voted for the initiative because they thought they were voting for same-sex marriage. Others voted against it because they were against same-sex marriage.127
当公民依赖电视广告、提案标题或他人建议来决定如何投票时，他们可能会感到困惑并做出错误的决定。2008 年，加州选民就第 8 号提案进行投票，该提案名为“取消同性伴侣的婚姻权”。投赞成票意味着选民希望将婚姻定义为仅限于一男一女之间的结合。尽管信息清晰明了，而且该法案的生效时间也相对较短，但许多选民仍然感到困惑。有些人误以为该修正案是关于同性婚姻的修正案。简而言之，有些人投赞成票是因为他们以为自己是在为同性婚姻投票。 而另一些人投反对票则是因为他们反对同性婚姻。

Direct democracy also opens the door to special interests funding personal projects. Any group can create an organization to spearhead an initiative or referendum. And because the cost of collecting signatures can be high in many states, signature collection may be backed by interest groups or wealthy individuals wishing to use the initiative to pass pet projects. The 2003 recall of California governor Gray Davis faced difficulties during the signature collection phase, but $2 million in donations by Representative Darrell Issa (R-CA) helped the organization attain nearly one million signatures.128 Many commentators argued that this example showed direct democracy is not always a process by the people, but rather a process used by the wealthy and business.

[.my2]
直接民主也为特殊利益集团资助个人项目打开了方便之门。任何团体都可以成立组织来发起倡议或公投。由于在许多州收集签名成本高昂，签名收集工作可能由利益集团或希望利用该倡议推动其个人项目的富裕人士资助。2003 年加州州长格雷·戴维斯的罢免行动在签名收集阶段就遇到了困难，但加州共和党众议员达雷尔·伊萨捐赠的 200 万美元帮助该组织获得了近 100 万个签名。许多评论员认为，这个例子表明，直接民主并不总是由人民主导的，而往往是富人和企业利用的手段。
