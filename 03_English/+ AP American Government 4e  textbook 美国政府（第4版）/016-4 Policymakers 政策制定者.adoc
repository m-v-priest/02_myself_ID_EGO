== 释义





Many Americans were concerned when Congress began debating the Affordable Care Act (ACA). As the program took shape, some people felt the changes it proposed were being debated too hastily, would be implemented too quickly, or would summarily give the government control over an important piece of the U.S. economy—the health care industry. Ironically, the government had been heavily engaged in providing health care for decades. More than 50 percent of all health care dollars spent were being spent by the U.S. government well before the ACA was enacted. As you have already learned, Medicare was created decades earlier. Despite protesters’ resistance to government involvement in health care, there is no keeping government out of Medicare; the government IS Medicare.

当国会开始辩论《 平价医疗法案 》（ACA）时，许多美国人感到担忧。随着该法案的逐步成形，一些人认为其提出的改革措施辩论过于仓促，实施速度过快，或者会直接赋予政府对美国经济重要组成部分——医疗保健行业的控制权。具有讽刺意味的是，几十年来，政府一直深度参与医疗保健服务。早在 ACA 颁布之前，美国政府就已承担了超过 50%的医疗保健支出。正如您已经了解到的， 联邦医疗保险（Medicare） 早在几十年前就已创立。尽管抗议者反对政府干预医疗保健，但政府无法完全置身于联邦医疗保险之外；事实上，政府本身就是联邦医疗保险的一部分。

What many did not realize is that few if any of the proposals that eventually became part of the ACA were original. While the country was worried about problems like terrorism, the economy, and conflicts over LGBTQ rights, armies of individuals were debating the best ways to fix the nation’s health care delivery. Two important but overlapping groups defended their preferred policy changes: policy advocates and policy analysts.

许多人没有意识到，最终纳入《平价医疗法案》（ACA）的提案几乎没有一项是原创的。当全国上下都在担忧恐怖主义、经济以及 LGBTQ 权益冲突等问题时，无数民众却在热烈讨论如何才能更好地改革美国的医疗保健体系。两类重要但又有所重叠的群体——政策倡导者和政策分析家——分别捍卫着他们各自支持的政策改革方案。

POLICY ADVOCATES  政策倡导者
Take a minute to think of a policy change you believe would improve some condition in the United States. Now ask yourself this: “Why do I want to change this policy?” Are you motivated by a desire for justice? Do you feel the policy change would improve your life or that of members of your community? Is your sense of morality motivating you to change the status quo? Would your profession be helped? Do you feel that changing the policy might raise your status?
请花一分钟时间思考一下，你认为哪项政策改变能够改善美国的某些状况。现在问问自己：“我为什么要改变这项政策？”你是出于对正义的渴望吗？你觉得这项政策改变会改善你或你所在社区成员的生活吗？你的道德感是否驱使你改变现状？你的职业会因此受益吗？你觉得改变这项政策会提升你的社会地位吗？

Most people have some policy position or issue they would like to see altered (see Figure 16.11). One of the reasons the news media are so enduring is that citizens have a range of opinions on public policy, and they are very interested in debating how a given change would improve their lives or the country’s. But despite their interests, most people do little more than vote or occasionally contribute to a political campaign. A few people, however, become policy advocates by actively working to propose or maintain public policy.

大多数人对某些政策立场或议题都有希望改变的地方（见图 16.11 ）。新闻媒体经久不衰的原因之一在于，公民对公共政策持有各种不同的观点，并且他们非常热衷于讨论某项变革将如何改善自身或国家的生活。然而，尽管他们对此感兴趣，但大多数人除了投票或偶尔参与政治竞选之外，鲜有实际行动。不过，也有少数人会积极投身于公共政策的倡导和维护工作，成为政策倡导者 。

One way to think about policy advocates is to recognize that they hold a normative position on an issue, that is, they have a conviction about what should or ought to be done. The best public policy, in their view, is one that accomplishes a specific goal or outcome. For this reason, advocates often begin with an objective and then try to shape or create proposals that help them accomplish that goal. Facts, evidence, and analysis are important tools for convincing policymakers or the general public of the benefits of their proposals. Private citizens often find themselves in advocacy positions, particularly if they are required to take on leadership roles in their private lives or in their organizations. The most effective advocates are usually hired professionals who form lobbying groups or think tanks to promote their agenda.

[.my2]
理解政策倡导者的一种方式是认识到他们对某个议题持有规范性立场，也就是说，他们对应该做什么或应当做什么有着坚定的信念。在他们看来，最好的公共政策是能够实现特定目标或结果的政策。因此，倡导者通常从目标出发，然后努力制定或提出有助于实现该目标的方案。事实、证据和分析是说服政策制定者或公众相信其方案益处的重要工具。普通公民也常常会扮演倡导者的角色，尤其是在他们被要求在私人生活或组织中承担领导角色时。最有效的倡导者通常是受雇的专业人士，他们组建游说团体或智库来推广他们的议程。

A lobbying group that frequently takes on advocacy roles is AARP (formerly the American Association of Retired Persons) (Figure 16.12). AARP’s primary job is to convince the government to provide more public resources and services to senior citizens, often through regulatory or redistributive politics. Chief among its goals are lower health care costs and the safety of Social Security pension payments. These aims put AARP in the Democratic Party’s electoral coalition, since Democrats have historically been stronger advocates for Medicare’s creation and expansion. In 2002, for instance, Democrats and Republicans were debating a major change to Medicare. The Democratic Party supported expanding Medicare to include free or low-cost prescription drugs, while the Republicans preferred a plan that would require seniors to purchase drug insurance through a private insurer. The government would subsidize costs, but many seniors would still have substantial out-of-pocket expenses. To the surprise of many, AARP supported the Republican proposal.

[.my2]
美国退休人员协会（ AARP ，前身为美国退休人员协会）是一个经常扮演倡导角色的游说团体（ 图 16.12 ）。AARP 的主要工作是说服政府为老年人提供更多公共资源和服务，通常通过监管或再分配政治手段来实现。其主要目标包括降低医疗保健成本和保障社会保障养老金的支付安全。这些目标使 AARP 成为民主党选举联盟的一员，因为民主党历来更积极地支持医疗保险（Medicare）的建立和扩展。例如，2002 年，民主党和共和党就医疗保险的一项重大改革展开辩论。民主党支持扩大医疗保险的覆盖范围，将免费或低价处方药纳入其中，而共和党则倾向于一项要求老年人通过私人保险公司购买药品保险的方案。政府将补贴部分费用，但许多老年人仍然需要承担相当可观的自付费用。出乎许多人意料的是，AARP 支持了共和党的提案。

[.my2]
图 16.12 第一夫人米歇尔·奥巴马在 2014 年 1 月 50 岁生日时展示了她的 AARP 会员卡。AARP 是老年人和退休人员的主要政策倡导者。
While Democrats argued that their position would have provided a better deal for individuals, AARP reasoned that the Republican plan had a much better chance of passing. The Republicans controlled the House and looked likely to reclaim control of the Senate in the upcoming election. Then-president George W. Bush was a Republican and would almost certainly have vetoed the Democratic approach. AARP’s support for the legislation helped shore up support for Republicans in the 2002 midterm election and also help convince a number of moderate Democrats to support the bill (with some changes), which passed despite apparent public disapproval. AARP had done its job as an advocate for seniors by creating a new benefit it hoped could later be expanded, rather than fighting for an extreme position that would have left it with nothing.21
尽管民主党人辩称他们的方案能为个人带来更好的利益，但美国退休人员协会（AARP）认为共和党的方案更有可能获得通过。共和党当时控制着众议院，并且很有可能在即将到来的选举中重新夺回参议院的控制权。时任总统乔治·W·布什是共和党人，他几乎肯定会否决民主党的方案。AARP 对该法案的支持帮助共和党在 2002 年中期选举中巩固了支持率，同时也说服了一些温和派民主党人支持该法案（并进行了一些修改），最终该法案在公众明显反对的情况下获得通过。AARP 作为老年人权益倡导者，通过创建一项新的福利并希望未来能够扩大范围，而不是去争取一个最终会使其一无所有、极端化的立场，从而履行了其职责 。21

Not all policy advocates are as willing to compromise their positions. It is much easier for a group like AARP to compromise over the amount of money seniors will receive, for instance, than it is for an evangelical religious group to compromise over issues like abortion, or for civil rights groups to accept something less than equality. Nor are women’s rights groups likely to accept pay inequality as it currently exists. It is easier to compromise over financial issues than over our individual views of morality or social justice.

[.my2]
并非所有政策倡导者都愿意妥协。例如，像美国退休人员协会（AARP）这样的组织，在老年人福利金额问题上做出妥协要比福音派宗教团体在堕胎等问题上妥协，或者民权组织接受低于平等标准的现状容易得多。同样，妇女权益组织也不太可能接受目前存在的薪酬不平等现象。在经济问题上做出妥协，比在个人道德或社会正义观念上做出妥协要容易得多。

POLICY ANALYSTS  政策分析师
A second approach to creating public policy is a bit more objective. Rather than starting with what ought to happen and seeking ways to make it so, policy analysts try to identify all the possible choices available to a decision maker and then gauge their impacts if implemented. The goal of the analyst isn’t really to encourage the implementation of any of the options; rather, it is to make sure decision makers are fully informed about the implications of the decisions they do make.

[.my2]
制定公共政策的第二种方法更为客观。 政策分析师并非从“应该发生什么”出发，然后寻求实现途径，而是努力识别决策者所有可能的选项，并评估这些选项实施后的影响。分析师的目标并非鼓励实施任何选项，而是确保决策者充分了解其决策的后果。

Understanding the financial and other costs and benefits of policy choices requires analysts to make strategic guesses about how the public and governmental actors will respond. For example, when policymakers are considering changes to health care policy, one very important question is how many people will participate. If very few people had chosen to take advantage of the new health care plans available under the ACA marketplace, it would have been significantly cheaper than advocates proposed, but it also would have failed to accomplish the key goal of increasing the number of insured. But if people who currently have insurance had dropped it to take advantage of ACA’s subsidies, the program’s costs would have skyrocketed with very little real benefit to public health. Similarly, had all states chosen to create their own marketplaces, the cost and complexity of ACA’s implementation would have been greatly reduced.

[.my2]
要了解政策选择的财务和其他成本及收益，分析人员需要对公众和政府行为者的反应做出战略性预测。例如，当政策制定者考虑医疗保健政策的改革时，一个非常重要的问题是会有多少人参与。如果只有极少数人选择利用《平价医疗法案》（ACA）市场下提供的新医保计划，那么成本虽然会比倡导者提出的方案低得多，但也无法实现增加参保人数这一关键目标。然而，如果目前已有医保的人为了享受 ACA 的补贴而放弃现有医保，那么该项目的成本将会飙升，而对公众健康的实际益处却微乎其微。同样，如果所有州都选择建立自己的医保市场，ACA 的实施成本和复杂性将会大大降低。

Because advocates have an incentive to understate costs and overstate benefits, policy analysis tends to be a highly politicized aspect of government. It is critical for policymakers and voters that policy analysts provide the most accurate analysis possible. A number of independent or semi-independent think tanks have sprung up in Washington, DC, to provide assessments of policy options. Most businesses or trade organizations also employ their own policy-analysis wings to help them understand proposed changes or even offer some of their own. Some of these try to be as impartial as possible. Most, however, have a known bias toward policy advocacy. The Cato Institute, for example, is well known and highly respected policy analysis group that both liberal and conservative politicians have turned to when considering policy options. But the Cato Institute has a known libertarian bias; most of the problems it selects for analysis have the potential for private sector solutions. This means its analysts tend to include the rosiest assumptions of economic growth when considering tax cuts and to overestimate the costs of public sector proposals.

[.my2]
由于倡导者往往倾向于低估成本、高估收益，政策分析往往成为政府工作中高度政治化的环节。对于政策制定者和选民而言，政策分析师提供尽可能准确的分析至关重要。华盛顿特区涌现出许多独立或半独立的智库，专门评估各种政策选项。大多数企业或行业协会也设有自己的政策分析部门，以帮助他们理解拟议的政策变革，甚至提出自己的建议。其中一些机构力求保持客观中立。然而，大多数机构都存在明显的政策倡导倾向。例如，卡托研究所是一家知名且备受尊敬的政策分析机构，自由派和保守派政治家在考虑政策选项时都会向其寻求帮助。但卡托研究所存在明显的自由主义倾向；它选择分析的大多数问题都存在私营部门解决方案的潜力。这意味着，其分析师在考虑减税方案时，往往会做出最乐观的经济增长假设，并高估公共部门提案的成本。

Both the Congress and the president have tried to reduce the bias in policy analysis by creating their own theoretically nonpartisan policy branches. In Congress, the best known of these is the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO. Authorized in the 1974 Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, the CBO was formally created in 1975 as a way of increasing Congress’s independence from the executive branch. The CBO is responsible for scoring the spending or revenue impact of all proposed legislation to assess its net effect on the budget. In recent years, it has been the CBO’s responsibility to provide Congress with guidance on how to best balance the budget (see Figure 16.13). The formulas that the CBO uses in scoring the budget have become an important part of the policy debate, even as the group has tried to maintain its nonpartisan nature.

国会和总统都曾试图通过设立各自理论上无党派的政策机构来减少政策分析中的偏见。在国会，其中最著名的机构是国会预算办公室 （CBO）。CBO 于 1975 年正式成立，其成立依据是 1974 年的《国会预算和扣押控制法案》，旨在增强国会相对于行政部门的独立性。CBO 负责对所有拟议立法的支出或收入影响进行评分，以评估其对预算的净影响。近年来，CBO 的职责之一是为国会提供如何最佳平衡预算的指导（见图 16.13 ）。尽管 CBO 一直努力保持其无党派性质，但其用于预算评分的公式已成为政策辩论的重要组成部分。

A dotted line from 2010 shows a minor increase to 2030 labeled “Projected”. At the bottom of the graph, a source is listed: “Congressional Budget Office. The 2021 Long-Term Budget Outlook.

Figure 16.13 The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is responsible for studying the impact of all proposed legislation to assess its net effect on the budget and tracking federal debt. For example, this 2021 CBO chart shows federal debt held by the public as a percentage of gross domestic product from 1790 through 2021 and projected to 2050.

In the executive branch, each individual department and agency is technically responsible for its own policy analysis. The assumption is that experts in the Federal Communications Commission or the Federal Elections Commission are best equipped to evaluate the impact of various proposals within their policy domain. Law requires that most regulatory changes made by the federal government also include the opportunity for public input so the government can both gauge public opinion and seek outside perspectives.

[.my2]
在行政部门，每个部门和机构在技术上都负责各自的政策分析。通常认为，联邦通信委员会或联邦选举委员会的专家最能胜任评估其政策领域内各项提案的影响。法律规定，联邦政府的大多数监管变更都必须提供公众参与的机会，以便政府既能了解公众意见，又能寻求外部视角。

Executive branch agencies are usually also charged with considering the economic impact of regulatory action, although some agencies have been better at this than others. Critics have frequently singled out the EPA and OSHA for failing to adequately consider the impact of new rules on business. Within the White House itself, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) was created to “serve the President of the United States in implementing his [or her] vision” of policy. Policy analysis is important to the OMB’s function, but as you can imagine, it frequently compromises its objectivity during policy formulation.

[.my2]
行政部门通常也负责评估监管措施的经济影响，尽管各机构在这方面做得有好有坏。批评人士经常指出，美国环保署（EPA）和职业安全与健康管理局（OSHA）未能充分考虑新规对企业的影响。在白宫内部，管理和预算办公室（OMB）的设立旨在“协助美国总统实施其政策愿景”。政策分析对 OMB 的职能至关重要，但正如您所想，它常常会影响 OMB 在政策制定过程中的客观性。

THE POLICY PROCESS  政策制定过程
The policy process contains four sequential stages: (1) agenda setting, (2) policy enactment, (3) policy implementation, and (4) evaluation. Given the sheer number of issues already processed by the government, called the continuing agenda, and the large number of new proposals being pushed at any one time, it is typically quite difficult to move a new policy all the way through the process.

[.my2]
政策制定过程包含四个连续阶段：（1）议程设置，（2）政策制定，（3）政策实施，以及（4）评估。鉴于政府已处理的议题数量庞大（称为持续议程），且任何时候都有大量新提案被提出，因此，一项新政策要顺利完成整个流程通常相当困难。

Agenda setting is the crucial first stage of the public policy process. Agenda setting has two subphases: problem identification and alternative specification. Problem identification identifies the issues that merit discussion. Not all issues make it onto the governmental agenda because there is only so much attention that government can pay. Thus, one of the more important tasks for a policy advocate is to frame the issue in a compelling way that raises a persuasive dimension or critical need.22 For example, health care reform has been attempted on many occasions over the years. One key to making the topic salient has been to frame it in terms of health care access, highlighting the percentage of people who do not have health insurance.

[.my2]
议程设置是公共政策制定过程中至关重要的第一阶段。议程设置包含两个子阶段：问题识别和方案制定。问题识别旨在确定值得讨论的问题。并非所有问题都能进入政府议程，因为政府的关注度有限。因此，政策倡导者最重要的任务之一就是以引人入胜的方式阐述问题，从而凸显其具有说服力的层面或迫切的需求。 例如 ，多年来，医疗改革已多次尝试。使这一议题引人注目的关键在于将其置于医疗服务可及性的框架下，强调没有医疗保险的人口比例。

Alternative specification, the second subphase of agenda setting, considers solutions to fix the difficulty raised in problem identification. For example, government officials may agree in the problem subphase that the increase in childhood obesity presents a societal problem worthy of government attention. However, the solution can be complex, and people who otherwise agree might come into conflict over what the best answer is. Alternatives might range from reinvestment in school physical education programs and health education classes, to taking soda and candy machines out of the schools and requiring good nutrition in school lunches. Agenda setting ends when a given problem has been selected, a solution has been paired with that problem, and the solution goes to the decision makers for a vote. Acid rain, which results from the interaction of rainstorms and thick air pollution, provides another nice illustration of agenda setting and the problems and solutions subphases. Acid rain is a widely recognized problem that did not make it on to the governmental policy agenda until Congress passed the Air Quality Act of 1967, long after environmental groups started asking for laws to regulate pollution.

[.my2]
议程设置的第二个子阶段——方案制定，旨在寻找解决问题识别阶段所提出难题的方案。例如，政府官员可能在问题阶段就一致认为，儿童肥胖率上升是一个值得政府关注的社会问题。然而，解决方案可能很复杂，即使是意见一致的人，也可能在最佳方案的选择上产生分歧。备选方案可能包括重新投资学校体育项目和健康教育课程，或者将汽水和糖果自动售货机从学校移除，并要求学校午餐提供营养均衡的食物。议程设置的结束阶段是：选定一个具体问题，找到与之匹配的解决方案，并将该解决方案提交决策者进行投票表决。酸雨是暴雨和严重空气污染相互作用的产物，它很好地诠释了议程设置以及问题和解决方案这两个子阶段。酸雨是一个广为人知的问题，但直到 1967 年国会通过《 空气质量法》 后才被列入政府政策议程，而在此之前，环保组织早已开始呼吁制定法律来监管污染。

In the second policy phase, enactment, the elected branches of government typically consider one specific solution to a problem and decide whether to pass it. This stage is the most visible one and usually garners the most press coverage. And yet it is somewhat anticlimatic. By the time a specific policy proposal (a solution) comes out of agenda setting for a yes/no vote, it can be something of a foregone conclusion that it will pass.

[.my2]
在政策制定的第二阶段——立法阶段，民选政府部门通常会审议针对某个问题的具体解决方案，并决定是否通过。这一阶段最为引人注目，也往往获得最多的媒体报道。然而，它却略显平淡。当一项具体的政策提案（解决方案）从议程设置阶段最终提交表决时，其通过几乎已成定局。

Once the policy has been enacted—usually by the legislative and/or executive branches of the government, like Congress or the president at the national level or the legislature or governor of a state—government agencies do the work of actually implementing it. On a national level, policy implementation can be either top-down or bottom-up. In top-down implementation, the federal government dictates the specifics of the policy, and each state implements it the same exact way. In bottom-up implementation, the federal government allows local areas some flexibility to meet their specific challenges and needs.23
政策一旦颁布——通常由政府的立法和/或行政部门制定，例如国家层面的国会或总统，或州层面的立法机构或州长——政府机构便负责实际执行。在国家层面，政策的实施可以是自上而下，也可以是自下而上。 自上而下的实施方式中，联邦政府规定政策的具体细节，各州完全按照相同的方式执行。 自下而上的实施方式中，联邦政府允许地方政府有一定的灵活性，以应对其面临的具体挑战和需求 。23

Evaluation, the last stage of the process, should be tied directly to the policy’s desired outcomes. Evaluation essentially asks, “How well did this policy do what we designed it to do?” The answers can sometimes be surprising. In one hotly debated case, the United States funded abstinence-only sex education for teens with the goal of reducing teen pregnancy. A 2011 study published in the journal PLoS One, however, found that abstinence-only education actually increased teen pregnancy rates.24 The most effective policy evaluations are systematic. For example, while a simple plotting of youth drug use data by year seemed to show no effect for the popular Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) program, a more careful evaluation done with a control group that did not receive DARE messaging showed robust effectiveness.25 The information from the evaluation stage can feed back into the other stages, informing future decisions and creating a public policy cycle (Figure 16.14).

[.my2]
评估是整个流程的最后一个阶段，应与政策的预期结果直接相关。评估本质上是在问：“这项政策在多大程度上实现了我们设计的目标？”答案有时会出人意料。在一个备受争议的案例中，美国资助了一项针对青少年的禁欲性教育，旨在降低青少年怀孕率。然而，2011 年发表在《公共科学图书馆·综合 》（PLoS One） 期刊上的一项研究发现，禁欲性教育实际上提高了青少年怀孕率。 24 最有效的政策评估是系统性的。例如，虽然简单地按年份绘制青少年吸毒数据图似乎显示，广受欢迎的“拒绝毒品滥用教育”（DARE）项目没有效果，但一项使用未接受 DARE 信息的对照组进行的更细致的评估却显示出了显著的有效性。 25 评估阶段的信息可以反馈到其他阶段，为未来的决策提供依据，从而形成一个公共政策循环（ 图 16.14 ）。

A flow diagram has four boxes. The first box “Agenda” says “Identify problem and solution”; the second box “Enactment” says “Approve acting on solution”; the third box “Implementation” says “Implement solution”; the fourth box “Evaluation” says “Assess the effectiveness of policy to address problem.”
