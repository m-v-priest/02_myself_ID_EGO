== 释义

When U.S. citizens think of governmental power, they most likely think of the presidency. The framers of the Constitution, however, clearly intended that Congress would be the cornerstone of the new republic. After years of tyranny under a king, they had little interest in creating another system with an overly powerful single individual at the top. Instead, while recognizing the need for centralization in terms of a stronger national government with an elected executive wielding its own authority, those at the Constitutional Convention wanted a strong representative assembly at the national level that would use careful consideration, deliberate action, and constituent representation to carefully draft legislation to meet the needs of the new republic. Thus, Article I of the Constitution grants several key powers to Congress, which include overseeing the budget and all financial matters, introducing legislation, confirming or rejecting judicial and executive nominations, and even declaring war.

当美国公民想到政府权力时，他们最先想到的很可能是总统。然而，宪法的制定者们显然希望国会成为新共和国的基石。在经历了多年的君主专制之后，他们并不想再建立一个权力过大的单一统治者体系。相反，尽管他们认识到需要建立一个权力更强大的中央政府，并由民选行政长官行使权力，但制宪会议的参与者们希望在国家层面建立一个强大的代表机构，通过审慎的思考、深思熟虑的行动和选民的代表，精心起草符合新共和国需求的法律。因此，宪法第一条赋予国会几项关键权力，包括监督预算和所有财政事务、提出立法、确认或否决司法和行政部门的提名，甚至宣战。

Today, however, Congress is the institution most criticized by the public, and the most misunderstood. How exactly does Capitol Hill operate (Figure 11.1)? What are the different structures and powers of the House of Representatives and the Senate? How are members of Congress elected? How do they reach their decisions about legislation, budgets, and military action? This chapter addresses these aspects and more as it explores “the first branch” of government.

然而，如今国会却是公众批评最多、误解也最深的机构。国会山究竟是如何运作的（ 图 11.1 ）？众议院和参议院的结构和权力有何不同？国会议员是如何选举产生的？他们如何就立法、预算和军事行动做出决定？本章将探讨这些方面以及更多内容，深入剖析政府的“第一分支”。




Figure 11.1 While the Capitol is the natural focus point of Capitol Hill and the workings of Congress, the Capitol complex includes over a dozen buildings, including the House of Representatives office buildings (left), the Senate office buildings (far right), the Library of Congress buildings (lower left), and the Supreme Court (lower right).
