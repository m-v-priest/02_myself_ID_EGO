== 释义





With the advent of motion picture newsreels and voice recordings in the 1920s, presidents began to broadcast their message to the general public. Franklin Roosevelt, while not the first president to use the radio, adopted this technology to great effect. Over time, as radio gave way to newer and more powerful technologies like television, the Internet, and social media, other presidents have been able magnify their voices to an even-larger degree. Presidents now have far more tools at their disposal to shape public opinion and build support for policies. However, the choice to “go public” does not always lead to political success; it is difficult to convert popularity in public opinion polls into political power. Moreover, the modern era of information and social media empowers opponents at the same time that it provides opportunities for presidents.

随着20世纪20年代电影新闻片和录音技术的出现，总统们开始向公众传播信息。富兰克林·罗斯福虽然不是第一位使用广播的总统，但他却将这项技术运用得卓有成效。随着时间的推移，广播逐渐被电视、互联网和社交媒体等更新、更强大的技术所取代，其他总统也得以将自己的声音放大到更大的程度。如今，总统们拥有更多工具来塑造公众舆论，并为政策争取支持。然而，“走向公众”的选择并非总能带来政治上的成功；将民意调查中的支持率转化为政治权力并非易事。此外，现代信息和社交媒体在为总统提供机遇的同时，也赋予了反对者更大的力量。

THE SHAPING OF THE MODERN PRESIDENCY
现代总统制的形成
From the days of the early republic through the end of the nineteenth century, presidents were limited in the ways they could reach the public to convey their perspective and shape policy. Inaugural addresses and messages to Congress, while circulated in newspapers, proved clumsy devices to attract support, even when a president used plain, blunt language. Some presidents undertook tours of the nation, notably George Washington and Rutherford B. Hayes. Others promoted good relationships with newspaper editors and reporters, sometimes going so far as to sanction a pro-administration newspaper. One president, Ulysses S. Grant, cultivated political cartoonist Thomas Nast to present the president’s perspective in the pages of the magazine Harper’s Weekly.37 Abraham Lincoln experimented with public meetings recorded by newspaper reporters and public letters that would appear in the press, sometimes after being read at public gatherings (Figure 12.13). Most presidents gave speeches, although few proved to have much immediate impact, including Lincoln’s memorable Gettysburg Address.

[.my2]
从共和国早期到十九世纪末，总统与公众沟通、传达观点和制定政策的渠道十分有限。就职演说和致国会的咨文虽然会在报纸上刊登，但即便总统使用直白坦率的语言，也难以有效地争取支持。一些总统会进行全国巡视，例如乔治·华盛顿和拉瑟福德·B·海斯。另一些总统则致力于与报纸编辑和记者建立良好关系，有时甚至会授权创办亲政府的报纸。尤利西斯·S·格兰特总统就曾聘请政治漫画家托马斯·纳斯特在《 哈珀周刊》 上发表总统的观点。 37 亚伯拉罕·林肯尝试过让报纸记者记录公众集会，以及在报纸上发表公开信（有时是在公众集会上宣读之后）（ 图 12.13 ）。大多数总统都会发表演讲，但很少有演讲能产生立竿见影的效果，包括林肯那篇著名的葛底斯堡演说。

Figure 12.13 While President Abraham Lincoln was not the first president to be photographed, he was the first to use the relatively new power of photography to enhance his power as president and commander-in-chief. Here, Lincoln poses with Union soldiers (a) during his visit to Antietam, Maryland, on October 3, 1862. President Ulysses S. Grant cultivated a relationship with popular cartoonist Thomas Nast, who often depicted the president in the company of “Lady Liberty” (b) in addition to relentlessly attacking his opponent Horace Greeley.

图 12.13 虽然亚伯拉罕·林肯总统并非第一位被拍照的总统，但他却是第一位利用当时相对较新的摄影技术来增强其总统和三军统帅权力的总统。图中，林肯于 1862 年 10 月 3 日访问马里兰州安提耶坦期间，与联邦士兵合影 (a)。尤利西斯·S·格兰特总统与著名漫画家托马斯·纳斯特建立了密切的联系，纳斯特经常将格兰特总统与“自由女神像” (b) 一同描绘在漫画中，同时还不断攻击他的对手霍勒斯·格里利。
Rather, most presidents exercised the power of patronage (or appointing people who are loyal and help them out politically) and private deal-making to get what they wanted at a time when Congress usually held the upper hand in such transactions. But even that presidential power began to decline with the emergence of civil service reform in the later nineteenth century, which led to most government officials being hired on their merit instead of through patronage. Only when it came to diplomacy and war were presidents able to exercise authority on their own, and even then, institutional as well as political restraints limited their independence of action.

[.my2]
相反，大多数总统在国会通常占据此类交易主导地位的时代，更多地依靠恩庇权力（即任命忠诚且在政治上助其一臂之力的人）和私下交易来达到目的。但随着19世纪后期公务员制度改革的出现，总统的这种权力也开始衰落，因为大多数政府官员都是凭借自身能力而非恩庇而被聘用的。只有在外交和战争领域，总统才能独立行使权力，即便如此，制度和政治上的制约也限制了他们的行动自主性。

Theodore Roosevelt came to the presidency in 1901, at a time when movie newsreels were becoming popular. Roosevelt, who had always excelled at cultivating good relationships with the print media, eagerly exploited this new opportunity as he took his case to the people with the concept of the presidency as bully pulpit, a platform from which to push his agenda to the public. His successors followed suit, and they discovered and employed new ways of transmitting their message to the people in an effort to gain public support for policy initiatives. With the popularization of radio in the early twentieth century, it became possible to broadcast the president’s voice into many of the nation’s homes. Most famously, FDR used the radio to broadcast his thirty “fireside chats” to the nation between 1933 and 1944.

[.my2]
西奥多·罗斯福于 1901 年就任总统，当时电影新闻片正逐渐流行。罗斯福一向善于与平面媒体建立良好关系，他积极利用这一新机遇，将总统职位视为 “讲坛” ，以此向公众宣传其政策纲领。他的继任者们也纷纷效仿，探索并运用新的方式向民众传递信息，以争取公众对政策的支持。20 世纪初，随着广播的普及，总统的声音得以传遍千家万户。其中最著名的例子是富兰克林·罗斯福在 1933 年至 1944 年间，利用广播向全国发表了 30 次“ 炉边谈话 ”。

In the post–World War II era, television began to replace radio as the medium through which presidents reached the public. This technology enhanced the reach of the handsome young president John F. Kennedy and the trained actor Ronald Reagan. At the turn of the twentieth century, the new technology was the Internet. The extent to which this mass media technology can enhance the power and reach of the president has yet to be fully realized. In the twenty-first century, presidents face a paradox. While there are more ways than ever to get their message out, be it television channels or social media networks, the complexity of modern media makes the prospects for presidents of directly reaching the public less certain. Former president Donald Trump took going public to the extreme, some days sending dozens of tweets to both promote his agenda and attack political opponents. Even his allies and senior officials would be surprised by some of the tweets.

[.my2]
二战后，电视逐渐取代广播，成为总统与公众沟通的主要媒介。这项技术极大地提升了英俊潇洒的年轻总统约翰·F·肯尼迪和受过专业训练的演员罗纳德·里根的影响力。二十世纪初，互联网成为新的科技。然而，这种大众传媒技术究竟能在多大程度上增强总统的权力和影响力，目前尚未完全显现。进入二十一世纪，总统们面临着一个悖论：尽管如今总统可以通过电视频道或社交媒体网络等多种渠道传递信息，但现代媒体的复杂性使得总统直接与公众沟通的可能性变得难以确定。前总统唐纳德·特朗普将公开露面发挥到了极致，他有时一天会发布数十条推文，既宣传自己的政策，又攻击政治对手。就连他的盟友和高级官员也会对他的某些推文感到惊讶。

Other presidents have used advances in transportation to take their case to the people. Woodrow Wilson traveled the country to advocate formation of the League of Nations. However, he fell short of his goal when he suffered a stroke in 1919 and cut his tour short. Both Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s and 1940s and Harry S. Truman in the 1940s and 1950s used air travel to conduct diplomatic and military business. Under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a specific plane, commonly called Air Force One, began carrying the president around the country and the world. This gives the president the ability to take their message directly to the far corners of the nation at any time.

[.my2]
其他总统也曾利用交通运输的进步来向民众传达他们的理念。伍德罗·威尔逊总统曾走遍全国，倡导成立国际联盟。然而，1919 年他突发中风，被迫中断行程，未能实现目标。20 世纪 30 年代和 40 年代的富兰克林·罗斯福总统以及 40 年代和 50 年代的哈里·S·杜鲁门总统都曾利用航空旅行处理外交和军事事务。在德怀特·D·艾森豪威尔总统任内，一架被称为“空军一号”的专机开始搭载总统在全国乃至世界各地出行。这使得总统能够随时随地将信息直接传达到全国各地。

GOING PUBLIC: PROMISE AND PITFALLS
上市：机遇与挑战
The concept of going public involves the president delivering a major television address in the hope that Americans watching the address will be compelled to contact their House and Senate member and that such public pressure will result in the legislators supporting the president on a major piece of legislation. Technological advances have made it more efficient for presidents to take their messages directly to the people than was the case before mass media (Figure 12.14). Presidential visits can build support for policy initiatives or serve political purposes, helping the president reward supporters, campaign for candidates, and seek reelection. It remains an open question, however, whether choosing to go public actually enhances a president’s political position in battles with Congress. Political scientist George C. Edwards goes so far as to argue that taking a president’s position public serves to polarize political debate, increase public opposition to the president, and complicate the chances to get something done. It replaces deliberation and compromise with confrontation and campaigning. Edwards believes the best way for presidents to achieve change is to keep issues private and negotiate resolutions that preclude partisan combat. Going public may be more effective in rallying supporters than in gaining additional support or changing minds.38
“公开表态” 的概念是指总统发表重要的电视讲话，希望观看讲话的美国民众能够联系各自的众议院和参议院议员，从而促使议员们在重要立法上支持总统。科技进步使得总统能够比大众媒体出现之前更有效地直接向民众传递信息（ 图 12.14 ）。总统访问可以争取民众对政策的支持，或服务于政治目的，例如帮助总统回报支持者、为候选人助选以及寻求连任。然而，选择公开表态是否真的能够提升总统在与国会博弈中的政治地位，仍然是一个悬而未决的问题。政治学家乔治·C·爱德华兹甚至认为，总统公开表态会使政治辩论两极分化，加剧公众对总统的反对，并增加政策落实的可能性。它用对抗和竞选取代了协商和妥协。爱德华兹认为，总统实现变革的最佳途径是保持议题的私密性，并通过谈判达成避免党派斗争的解决方案。公开表态在争取支持者方面可能比获得更多支持或改变人们的想法更有效 。38

Figure 12.14 With the advent of video technology and cable television, the power of the president to reach huge audiences increased exponentially. President Ronald Reagan, shown here giving one of his most famous speeches in Berlin, was an expert at using technology to help mold and project his presidential image to the public. His training as an actor certainly helped in this regard.

图 12.14 随着视频技术和有线电视的出现，总统触及庞大受众的能力呈指数级增长。图中所示的罗纳德· 里根总统正在柏林发表他最著名的演讲之一，他非常擅长利用科技来塑造和向公众展示自己的总统形象。他作为演员的训练无疑对此大有裨益。

THE FIRST LADY: A SECRET WEAPON?
第一夫人：秘密武器？
The president is not the only member of the First Family who often attempts to advance an agenda by going public. First ladies increasingly exploited the opportunity to gain public support for an issue of deep interest to them. Before 1933, most first ladies served as private political advisers to their husbands. In the 1910s, Edith Bolling Wilson took a more active but still private role assisting her husband, President Woodrow Wilson, afflicted by a stroke, in the last years of his presidency. However, as the niece of one president and the wife of another, it was Eleanor Roosevelt in the 1930s and 1940s who opened the door for first ladies to do something more.

[.my2]
总统并非唯一一位经常通过公开露面来推进自身议程的第一家庭成员。第一夫人也日益利用这一机会，为她们深切关注的议题争取公众支持。1933 年以前，大多数第一夫人都是丈夫的私人政治顾问。20 世纪 10 年代，伊迪丝·博林 ·威尔逊在丈夫伍德罗·威尔逊总统任期的最后几年里，扮演了更为积极但仍保持低调的角色，协助他应对中风带来的挑战。然而，作为一位总统的侄女和另一位总统的妻子，埃莉诺 ·罗斯福在 20 世纪 30 年代和 40 年代为第一夫人开启了更多参与政治的大门。

Eleanor Roosevelt took an active role in championing civil rights, becoming in some ways a bridge between her husband and the civil rights movement. She coordinated meetings between FDR and members of the NAACP, championed antilynching legislation, openly defied segregation laws, and pushed the Army Nurse Corps to allow Black women in its ranks. She also wrote a newspaper column and had a weekly radio show. Her immediate successors returned to the less visible role held by her predecessors, although in the early 1960s, Jacqueline Kennedy gained attention for her efforts to refurbish the White House along historical lines, and Lady Bird Johnson in the mid- and late 1960s endorsed an effort to beautify public spaces and highways in the United States. She also established the foundations of what came to be known as the Office of the First Lady, complete with a news reporter, Liz Carpenter, as her press secretary.

[.my2]
埃莉诺·罗斯福积极投身于民权运动，在某种程度上成为她丈夫与民权运动之间的桥梁。她协调富兰克林·罗斯福与全国有色人种协进会（NAACP）成员的会面，支持反私刑立法，公开挑战种族隔离法，并推动陆军护理队接纳黑人女性。她还撰写报纸专栏，并主持每周一次的广播节目。她的继任者们回归了前任们较为低调的角色，尽管在 20 世纪 60 年代初，杰奎琳 ·肯尼迪因其按照历史原貌翻新白宫的努力而备受关注，而伯德· 约翰逊夫人则在 60 年代中后期支持美化美国公共空间和公路的行动。她还奠定了后来被称为 “第一夫人办公室” 的基础，并任命新闻记者莉兹·卡彭特担任她的新闻秘书。

Betty Ford took over as first lady in 1974 and became an avid advocate of women’s rights, proclaiming that she was pro-choice when it came to abortion and lobbying for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). She shared with the public the news of her breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent mastectomy. Her successor, Rosalynn Carter, attended several cabinet meetings and pushed for the ratification of the ERA as well as for legislation addressing mental health issues (Figure 12.15).

[.my2]
贝蒂· 福特于 1974 年就任第一夫人，她积极倡导女性权益，公开支持女性在堕胎问题上的选择权，并游说批准《 平等权利修正案 》（ERA）。她向公众公开了自己被诊断出患有乳腺癌以及随后接受乳房切除手术的消息。她的继任者罗莎琳 ·卡特出席了多次内阁会议，并推动批准《平等权利修正案》以及有关精神健康问题的立法（ 图 12.15 ）。

The increasing public political role of the first lady continued in the 1980s with Nancy Reagan’s “Just Say No” antidrug campaign and in the early 1990s with Barbara Bush’s efforts on behalf of literacy. The public role of the first lady reach a new level with Hillary Clinton in the 1990s when her husband put her in charge of his efforts to achieve health care reform, a controversial decision that did not meet with political success. Her successors, Laura Bush in the first decade of the twenty-first century and Michelle Obama in the second, returned to the roles played by predecessors in advocating less controversial policies: Laura Bush advocated literacy and education, while Michelle Obama has emphasized physical fitness and healthy diet and exercise. Nevertheless, the public and political profiles of first ladies remain high, and in the future, the president’s spouse will have the opportunity to use that unelected position to advance policies that might well be less controversial and more appealing than those pushed by the president.

[.my2]
第一夫人日益重要的公共政治角色在 20 世纪 80 年代延续，南希· 里根发起的“对毒品说不”禁毒运动便是例证；90 年代初，芭芭拉 ·布什致力于扫盲工作，也进一步强化了这一角色。到了 90 年代，希拉里 ·克林顿将第一夫人的公共角色推向了新的高度，她的丈夫委任她负责推动医改，这一颇具争议的决定最终未能取得政治成功。她的继任者，21 世纪初的劳拉 ·布什和 21 世纪末的米歇尔· 奥巴马 ，则回归了前任们的角色，倡导争议较小的政策：劳拉·布什倡导扫盲和教育，而米歇尔·奥巴马则强调身体健康、健康饮食和锻炼。尽管如此，第一夫人的公众形象和政治影响力依然举足轻重。未来，总统的配偶将有机会利用这一非民选职位，推动一些可能比总统所推行的政策更具吸引力、争议更小的举措。

Insider Perspective  内部视角
A New Role for the First Lady?
第一夫人将扮演新角色？
While running for the presidency for the first time in 1992, Bill Clinton frequently touted the experience and capabilities of his wife. There was a lot to brag about. Hillary Rodham Clinton was a graduate of Yale Law School, had worked as a member of the impeachment inquiry staff during the height of the Watergate scandal in Nixon’s administration, and had been a staff attorney for the Children’s Defense Fund before becoming the first lady of Arkansas. Acknowledging these qualifications, candidate Bill Clinton once suggested that by electing him, voters would get “two for the price of one.” The clear implication in this statement was that his wife would take on a far larger role than previous first ladies, and this proved to be the case.39
1992 年，比尔 ·克林顿首次竞选总统时，经常吹捧妻子的经验和能力。的确，希拉里·罗德姆·克林顿有很多值得称道之处。她毕业于耶鲁大学法学院，曾在尼克松政府水门事件最严重时期担任弹劾调查组成员，在成为阿肯色州第一夫人之前，还曾担任儿童保护基金会的律师。鉴于这些资历，候选人比尔·克林顿曾表示，选民如果选择他，就相当于“花一份钱，得到两份服务”。这句话的言外之意是，他的妻子将承担比以往任何一位第一夫人都更为重要的角色，而事实也的确如此 。39

Shortly after taking office, Clinton appointed the first lady to chair the Task Force on National Health Care Reform. This organization was to follow through on his campaign promise to fix the problems in the U.S. healthcare system. Hillary Clinton had privately requested the appointment, but she quickly realized that the complex web of business interests and political aspirations combined to make the topic of health care reform a hornet’s nest. This put the Clinton administration’s first lady directly into partisan battles few if any previous first ladies had ever faced.

[.my2]
克林顿就职后不久，便任命第一夫人担任国家医疗改革工作组主席。该组织旨在落实他竞选时作出的解决美国医疗体系弊端的承诺。希拉里·克林顿曾私下提出这项任命，但她很快意识到，错综复杂的商业利益和政治抱负交织在一起，使得医疗改革成为一个棘手的难题。这使得克林顿政府的第一夫人直接卷入了前所未有的党派斗争。

As a testament to both the large role the first lady had taken on and the extent to which she had become the target of political attacks, the recommendations of the task force were soon dubbed “Hillarycare” by opponents. In a particularly contentious hearing in the House, the first lady and Republican representative Dick Armey exchanged pointed jabs with each other. At one point, Armey suggested that the reports of her charm were “overstated” after the first lady likened him to Dr. Jack Kevorkian, a physician known for helping patients commit suicide (Figure 12.16).40 The following summer, the first lady attempted to use a national bus tour to popularize the health care proposal, although distaste for her and for the program had reached such a fevered pitch that she sometimes was compelled to wear a bulletproof vest. In the end, the efforts came up short and the reform attempts were abandoned as a political failure. Nevertheless, Hillary Clinton remained a political lightning rod for the rest of the Clinton presidency.

[.my2]
为了证明第一夫人所扮演的重要角色以及她所遭受的政治攻击之猛烈，工作组的建议很快就被反对者戏称为“希拉里医改”。在众议院一场尤其激烈的听证会上，第一夫人和共和党众议员迪克·阿米针锋相对，互相攻击。在第一夫人将阿米比作杰克·凯沃尔基安医生（一位以帮助病人自杀而闻名的医生， 见图 12.16 ）之后，阿米暗示有关她魅力的报道“言过其实”。 40 次年夏天，第一夫人试图通过全国巴士巡回宣传医改方案，但人们对她和该方案的反感已经达到了顶点，以至于她有时不得不穿上防弹背心。最终，这些努力以失败告终，改革尝试也因政治上的失败而被放弃。尽管如此，在克林顿总统任期的剩余时间里，希拉里·克林顿仍然是政治上的焦点人物。

What do the challenges of First Lady Hillary Clinton’s foray into national politics suggest about the dangers of a first lady abandoning the traditionally safe nonpartisan goodwill efforts? What do the actions of the first ladies since Clinton suggest about the lessons learned or not learned?
第一夫人希拉里·克林顿进军国家政治所面临的挑战，预示着第一夫人放弃传统上稳妥的非党派友好努力会带来哪些风险？自克林顿以来，历任第一夫人的行动又表明她们吸取了哪些教训（或没有吸取哪些教训）？
