== 释义





The process of electing a president every four years has evolved over time. This evolution has resulted from attempts to correct the cumbersome procedures first offered by the framers of the Constitution and as a result of political parties’ rising power to act as gatekeepers to the presidency. Over the last several decades, the manner by which parties have chosen candidates has trended away from congressional caucuses and conventions and towards a drawn-out series of state contests, called primaries and caucuses, which begin in the winter prior to the November general election.

每四年一次的总统选举程序随着时间的推移而不断演变。这种演变源于对宪法制定者最初提出的繁琐程序的修正，以及政党权力日益增长，成为总统职位把关人的结果。在过去的几十年里，政党选择候选人的方式逐渐从国会党团会议和代表大会转向一系列旷日持久的州级竞选，即初选和党团会议，这些竞选通常在11月大选前的冬季开始。

SELECTING THE CANDIDATE: THE PARTY PROCESS
候选人遴选：政党流程
The framers of the Constitution made no provision in the document for the establishment of political parties. Indeed, parties were not necessary to select the first president, since George Washington ran unopposed. Following the first election of Washington, the political party system gained steam and power in the electoral process, creating separate nomination and general election stages. Early on, the power to nominate presidents for office bubbled up from the party operatives in the various state legislatures and toward what was known as the king caucus or congressional caucus. The caucus or large-scale gathering was made up of legislators in the Congress who met informally to decide on nominees from their respective parties. In somewhat of a countervailing trend in the general election stage of the process, by the presidential election of 1824, many states were using popular elections to choose their electors. This became important in that election when Andrew Jackson won the popular vote and the largest number of electors, but the presidency was given to John Quincy Adams instead. Out of the frustration of Jackson’s supporters emerged a powerful two-party system that took control of the selection process.19
宪法的制定者并未在宪法中规定建立政党。事实上，由于乔治·华盛顿在没有竞争对手的情况下当选，政党并非选出首任总统的必要条件。华盛顿首次当选后， 政党制度在选举过程中逐渐发展壮大，并形成了独立的提名和普选阶段。早期，总统候选人的提名权从各州议会的政党人士手中向上渗透，最终落入所谓的 “国王党团” 或“国会党团”。这种党团或大型集会由国会议员非正式会面，决定各自政党的候选人。在普选阶段，出现了一种与之相反的趋势：到 1824 年总统大选时，许多州开始采用普选的方式来选出选举人。这在那次选举中尤为重要，因为安德鲁 ·杰克逊赢得了普选票和最多的选举人票，但最终当选总统的却是约翰·昆西 ·亚当斯 。杰克逊的支持者们因不满而感到沮丧，由此催生了一个强大的两党制，并最终掌控了选举过程 。19

In the decades that followed, party organizations, party leaders, and workers met in national conventions to choose their nominees, sometimes after long struggles that took place over multiple ballots. In this way, the political parties kept a tight control on the selection of a candidate. In the early twentieth century, however, some states began to hold primaries, elections in which candidates vied for the support of state delegations to the party’s nominating convention. Over the course of the century, the primaries gradually became a far more important part of the process, though the party leadership still controlled the route to nomination through the convention system. This has changed in recent decades, and now a majority of the delegates are chosen through primary elections, and the party conventions themselves are little more than a widely publicized rubber-stamping event.

[.my2]
在随后的几十年里，各政党组织、党魁和党员齐聚全国代表大会，选出各自的候选人，有时需要经过多轮投票，耗时良久。通过这种方式，各政党牢牢掌控着候选人的遴选过程。然而，在 20 世纪初，一些州开始举行初选 ，候选人在初选中争取州代表团的支持，参加党的提名大会。整个世纪以来，初选逐渐成为选举过程中更为重要的组成部分，尽管党的领导层仍然通过党代表大会制度控制着提名途径。但近几十年来，情况发生了变化，如今大多数代表都是通过初选产生的，而党的提名大会本身也只不过是一场广为人知的橡皮图章式活动。

The rise of the presidential primary and caucus system as the main means by which presidential candidates are selected has had a number of anticipated and unanticipated consequences. For one, the campaign season has grown longer and more costly. In 1960, John F. Kennedy declared his intention to run for the presidency just eleven months before the general election. Compare this to Hillary Clinton, who announced her intention to run nearly two years before the 2008 general election. Today’s long campaign seasons are seasoned with a seemingly ever-increasing number of debates among contenders for the nomination. In 2016, when the number of candidates for the Republican nomination became large and unwieldy, two debates among them were held, in which only those candidates polling greater support were allowed in the more important prime-time debate. The runners-up spoke in the other debate. In 2020, it was the Democratic party that had a large field that required staggered debates, before the field narrowed and ultimately led to the nomination of former vice president Joe Biden, who would go on to choose fellow campaigner Kamala Harris as his running mate.

[.my2]
总统初选和党团会议制度的兴起，作为总统候选人选拔的主要方式，带来了一系列预料之中和意料之外的后果。首先，竞选季变得更长、成本更高。1960 年，约翰·F·肯尼迪在普选前仅 11 个月才宣布参选。相比之下，希拉里·克林顿在 2008 年普选前近两年就宣布了参选意向。如今漫长的竞选季还伴随着候选人之间辩论数量的不断增加。2016 年，共和党总统候选人数量庞大，难以有效管理，因此举行了两场辩论，只有支持率较高的候选人才能参加更为重要的黄金时段辩论，而支持率较低的候选人则参加另一场辩论。 2020 年，民主党候选人众多，需要分阶段进行辩论，之后候选人范围缩小，最终提名了前副总统乔·拜登，他随后选择了竞选伙伴卡马拉·哈里斯作为他的竞选搭档。

Finally, the process of going straight to the people through primaries and caucuses has created some opportunities for party outsiders to rise. Neither Ronald Reagan nor Bill Clinton was especially popular with the party leadership of the Republicans or the Democrats (respectively) at the outset. The outsider phenomenon has been most clearly demonstrated, however, in the 2016 presidential nominating process, as those distrusted by the party establishment, such as Senator Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, who never before held political office, raced ahead of party favorites like Jeb Bush early in the primary process (Figure 12.6).

[.my2]
最后，通过初选和党团会议直接面向民众的选举方式，为党外人士的崛起创造了一些机会。罗纳德·里根和比尔·克林顿在竞选之初都未必特别受共和党或民主党领导层的欢迎。然而，这种“局外人”现象在 2016 年总统提名过程中得到了最明显的体现。那些不被党内建制派信任的人，例如参议员特德·克鲁兹和唐纳德· 特朗普 ，他们此前从未担任过任何政治职务，却在初选初期就超越了杰布·布什等党内热门人选（ 图 12.6 ）。

The rise of the primary system during the Progressive Era came at the cost of party regulars’ control of the process of candidate selection. Some party primaries even allow registered independents or members of the opposite party to vote. Even so, the process tends to attract the party faithful at the expense of independent voters, who often hold the key to victory in the fall contest. Thus, candidates who want to succeed in the primary contests seek to align themselves with committed partisans, who are often at the ideological extreme. Those who survive the primaries in this way have to moderate their image as they enter the general election if they hope to succeed among the rest of the party adherents and the uncommitted.

[.my2]
进步时代初选制度的兴起，削弱了党内固定成员对候选人遴选过程的控制。一些政党的初选甚至允许已登记的独立选民或反对党成员投票。即便如此，这一制度往往更倾向于吸引党内忠实拥护者，而忽视了独立选民，后者往往是秋季大选胜负的关键。因此，想要在初选中胜出的候选人会寻求与立场鲜明的党派人士结盟，而这些人士往往在意识形态上较为极端。那些以这种方式通过初选的候选人，如果希望在大选中赢得其他党内支持者和摇摆选民的支持，就必须在进入大选时调整自身形象。

Primaries offer tests of candidates’ popular appeal, while state caucuses testify to their ability to mobilize and organize grassroots support among committed followers. Primaries also reward candidates in different ways, with some giving the winner all the state’s convention delegates, while others distribute delegates proportionately according to the distribution of voter support. Finally, the order in which the primary elections and caucus selections are held shape the overall race.20 Currently, the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary occur first. These early contests tend to shrink the field as candidates who perform poorly leave the race. At other times in the campaign process, some states will maximize their impact on the race by holding their primaries on the same day that other states do. The media has dubbed these critical groupings “Super Tuesdays,” “Super Saturdays,” and so on. They tend to occur later in the nominating process as parties try to force the voters to coalesce around a single nominee.

[.my2]
初选检验候选人的民众支持率，而州党团会议则体现他们动员和组织基层支持者的能力。初选对候选人的奖励方式也各不相同，有的初选会将州内所有党代表的席位授予获胜者，有的则根据选民支持率的分布比例分配代表。最后，初选和党团会议的举行顺序也会影响整个选情。目前， 爱荷华州党团会议和新罕布什尔州初选最先举行。这些早期的竞争往往会缩小候选人范围，表现不佳的候选人会退出竞选。在竞选过程中的其他阶段，一些州会通过与其他州在同一天举行初选来最大限度地影响选情。媒体将这些关键的“超级星期二”、“超级星期六”等称为“超级星期二”、“超级星期六”等等。这些“超级星期二”通常出现在提名过程的后期，因为各政党试图迫使选民团结在一位候选人周围。

The rise of the primary has also displaced the convention itself as the place where party regulars choose their standard bearer. Once true contests in which party leaders fought it out to elect a candidate, by the 1970s, party conventions more often than not simply served to rubber-stamp the choice of the primaries. By the 1980s, the convention drama was gone, replaced by a long, televised commercial designed to extol the party’s greatness (Figure 12.7). Without the drama and uncertainty, major news outlets have steadily curtailed their coverage of the conventions, convinced that few people are interested. The 2016 elections seem to support the idea that the primary process produces a nominee rather than party insiders. Outsiders Donald Trump on the Republican side and Senator Bernie Sanders on the Democratic side had much success despite significant concerns about them from party elites. Whether this pattern could be reversed in the case of a closely contested selection process remains to be seen.

[.my2]
初选的兴起也取代了党代会本身，成为党内正式成员选出候选人的场所。曾经，党代会是党内领导人为选出候选人而展开的真正较量，但到了 20 世纪 70 年代，党代会往往沦为对初选结果的橡皮图章式确认。到了 20 世纪 80 年代，党代会的戏剧性场面不复存在，取而代之的是冗长的电视广告，旨在颂扬党的伟大（ 图 12.7 ）。由于失去了戏剧性和不确定性，主流媒体逐渐减少了对党代会的报道，他们认为很少有人对此感兴趣。2016 年的选举似乎印证了初选过程而非党内人士才是最终候选人的观点。共和党的局外人唐纳德·特朗普和民主党的参议员伯尼· 桑德斯尽管受到党内精英的诸多质疑，仍然取得了巨大的成功。在竞争激烈的选举过程中，这种模式是否会逆转，还有待观察。

ELECTING THE PRESIDENT: THE GENERAL ELECTION
总统选举：大选
Early presidential elections, conducted along the lines of the original process outlined in the Constitution, proved unsatisfactory. So long as George Washington was a candidate, his election was a foregone conclusion. But it took some manipulation of the votes of electors to ensure that the second-place winner (and thus the vice president) did not receive the same number of votes. When Washington declined to run again after two terms, matters worsened. In 1796, political rivals John Adams and Thomas Jefferson were elected president and vice president, respectively. Yet the two men failed to work well together during Adams’s administration, much of which Jefferson spent at his Virginia residence at Monticello. As noted earlier in this chapter, the shortcomings of the system became painfully evident in 1800, when Jefferson and his running mate Aaron Burr finished tied, thus leaving it to the House of Representatives to elect Jefferson.21
早期总统选举按照宪法最初规定的程序进行，结果并不尽如人意。只要乔治 ·华盛顿参选，他的当选就已成定局。但为了确保得票第二的候选人（也就是副总统）不会获得与总统相同的票数，必须对选举人票进行一些操纵。华盛顿两届任期结束后拒绝再次参选，情况变得更加糟糕。1796 年，政治对手约翰· 亚当斯和托马斯 ·杰斐逊分别当选总统和副总统。然而，在亚当斯执政期间，两人未能有效合作，而杰斐逊则大部分时间都待在位于弗吉尼亚州的蒙蒂塞洛庄园。正如本章前面提到的，该制度的缺陷在 1800 年暴露无遗，当时杰斐逊和他的竞选伙伴亚伦·伯尔得票相同，最终由众议院选举杰斐逊 。21

The Twelfth Amendment, ratified in 1804, provided for the separate election of president and vice president as well as setting out ways to choose a winner if no one received a majority of the electoral votes. Only once since the passage of the Twelfth Amendment, during the election of 1824, has the House selected the president under these rules, and only once, in 1836, has the Senate chosen the vice president. In several elections, such as in 1876 and 1888, a candidate who received less than a majority of the popular vote has claimed the presidency, including cases when the losing candidate secured a majority of the popular vote. A recent case was the 2000 election, in which Democratic nominee Al Gore won the popular vote, while Republican nominee George W. Bush won the Electoral College vote and hence the presidency. The 2016 election brought another such irregularity as Donald Trump comfortably won the Electoral College by narrowly winning the popular vote in several states, while Hillary Clinton collected nearly 2.9 million more votes nationwide.

[.my2]
1804 年批准的第十二修正案规定总统和副总统分别选举，并制定了在没有候选人获得多数选举人票的情况下如何选出获胜者的方案。自第十二修正案通过以来，众议院仅在 1824 年的选举中根据这些规则选出了总统，参议院也仅在 1836 年的选举中选出了副总统。在一些选举中，例如 1876 年和 1888 年，获得普选票未过半数的候选人最终当选总统，其中也包括一些普选票过半的落选候选人。最近的一个例子是 2000 年的总统选举，民主党候选人阿尔· 戈尔赢得了普选，而共和党候选人乔治·W· 布什赢得了选举人团的投票，从而当选总统。 2016 年的选举又出现了类似的异常情况，唐纳德·特朗普在几个州以微弱优势赢得了普选，从而轻松赢得了选举人团的胜利，而希拉里·克林顿在全国范围内获得了近 290 万张额外的选票。

Not everyone is satisfied with how the Electoral College fundamentally shapes the election, especially in cases such as those noted above, when a candidate with a minority of the popular vote claims victory over a candidate who drew more popular support. Yet movements for electoral reform, including proposals for a straightforward nationwide direct election by popular vote, have gained little traction.

[.my2]
并非所有人都对选举人团制度从根本上左右选举结果的方式感到满意，尤其是在上述情况下，当一位候选人仅获得少数普选票却战胜了获得更多普选票的候选人时。然而，包括提议实行全国普选在内的选举改革运动却鲜有进展。

Supporters of the current system defend it as a manifestation of federalism, arguing that it also guards against the chaos inherent in a multiparty environment by encouraging the current two-party system. They point out that under a system of direct election, candidates would focus their efforts on more populous regions and ignore others.22 Critics, on the other hand, charge that the current system negates the one-person, one-vote basis of U.S. elections, subverts majority rule, works against political participation in states deemed safe for one party, and might lead to chaos should an elector desert a candidate, thus thwarting the popular will. Despite all this, the system remains in place. It appears that many people are more comfortable with the problems of a flawed system than with the uncertainty of change.23
现行制度的支持者辩称，它是联邦制的体现，并认为它通过鼓励两党制来防止多党制下固有的混乱。他们指出，在直接选举制度下，候选人会将精力集中在人口更密集的地区，而忽略其他地区。 22 另一方面，批评者则指责现行制度否定了美国选举中一人一票的原则，破坏了多数原则，阻碍了在被认为对某一政党有利的州参与政治，并且如果选民背弃候选人，可能会导致混乱，从而违背民意。尽管如此，该制度仍然沿用。看来，许多人宁愿接受一个有缺陷的制度所带来的问题，也不愿面对变革带来的不确定性。 23

Electoral College Reform
选举团改革
Following the 2000 presidential election, when then-governor George W. Bush won by a single electoral vote and with over half a million fewer individual votes than his challenger, astonished voters called for Electoral College reform. Years later, however, nothing of any significance had been done. The absence of reform in the wake of such a problematic election is a testament to the staying power of the Electoral College. The 2016 election results were even more disparate. While in 2000, Al Gore won a narrow victory in the popular vote with Bush prevailing by one vote in the Electoral College, in 2016, Clinton won the popular vote by a margin of almost 3 million votes, while Trump won the Electoral College comfortably. In 2020, the results aligned, with Joe Biden winning the popular vote and Electoral College by comfortable margins, although several battleground states were very close.

[.my2]
2000 年总统大选后，时任州长的乔治·W·布什以一票之差险胜，而他获得的普选票比挑战者少了超过 50 万张，这令选民震惊不已，他们呼吁改革选举人团制度 。然而，多年过去，却没有任何实质性的改变。如此充满争议的选举之后，选举人团制度却迟迟未能改革，这恰恰证明了其强大的生命力。2016 年的选举结果更加悬殊。2000 年，阿尔·戈尔在普选中险胜，而布什在选举人团中仅以一票之差取胜；2016 年，希拉里·克林顿以近 300 万张选票的优势赢得普选，而特朗普则轻松赢得选举人团的胜利。2020 年，选举结果趋于一致，乔·拜登以较大优势赢得普选和选举人团的胜利，尽管几个关键摇摆州的选情非常胶着。

Those who insist that the Electoral College should be reformed argue that its potential benefits pale in comparison to the way the Electoral College depresses voter turnout and fails to represent the popular will. In addition to favoring small states, since individual votes there count more than in larger states due to the mathematics involved in the distribution of electors, the Electoral College results in a significant number of “safe” states that receive no real electioneering, such that nearly 75 percent of the country is ignored in the general election.

[.my2]
那些坚持改革选举人团制度的人认为，与选举人团制度压低投票率、无法代表民意所带来的弊端相比，其潜在的益处显得微不足道。由于选举人票分配的数学原理，小州的每张选票比大州的更重要，因此选举人团制度不仅有利于小州，还导致大量“安全州”的选举活动几乎停滞，以至于近75%的美国选民在普选中被忽略。

One potential solution to the problems with the Electoral College is to scrap it all together and replace it with the popular vote. The popular vote would be the aggregated totals of the votes in the fifty states and District of Columbia, as certified by the head election official of each state. A second solution often mentioned is to make the Electoral College proportional. That is, as each state assigns it electoral votes, it would do so based on the popular vote percentage in their state, rather with the winner-take-all approach almost all the states use today.

[.my2]
解决选举人团制度问题的一个潜在方案是彻底废除该制度，代之以普选。普选票数将是五十个州和哥伦比亚特区所有选票的总和，并由各州首席选举官员认证。另一个常被提及的方案是实行比例制选举人团制度。也就是说，各州在分配选举人票时，将根据本州的普选票百分比来分配，而不是像现在几乎所有州那样采用赢者通吃的制度。

A third alternative for Electoral College reform has been proposed by an organization called National Popular Vote. The National Popular Vote movement is an interstate compact between multiple states that sign onto the compact. Once a combination of states constituting 270 Electoral College votes supports the movement, each state entering the compact pledges all of its Electoral College votes to the national popular vote winner. This reform does not technically change the Electoral College structure, but it results in a mandated process that makes the Electoral College reflect the popular vote. Thus far, seventeen states and the District of Columbia with a total of 209 electoral votes among them have signed onto the compact.

[.my2]
一个名为“全国普选”（National Popular Vote）的组织提出了第三种选举人团改革方案。“全国普选”运动是一项跨州协议，由多个州签署组成。一旦拥有 270 张选举人票的州支持该运动，每个加入协议的州都将承诺把其所有选举人票投给全国普选的获胜者。这项改革在技术上并未改变选举人团的结构，但它通过一项强制性程序，使选举人团的组成能够反映普选结果。目前，已有 17 个州和哥伦比亚特区（共计 209 张选举人票）签署了该协议。

The general election usually features a series of debates between the presidential contenders as well as a debate among vice presidential candidates. Because the stakes are high, quite a bit of money and resources are expended on all sides. Attempts to rein in the mounting costs of modern general-election campaigns have proven ineffective. Nor has public funding helped to solve the problem. Indeed, starting with Barack Obama’s 2008 decision to forfeit public funding so as to skirt the spending limitations imposed, candidates now regularly opt to raise more money rather than to take public funding.24 In addition, political action committees (PACs), supposedly focused on issues rather than specific candidates, seek to influence the outcome of the race by supporting or opposing a candidate according to the PAC’s own interests. But after all the spending and debating is done, those who have not already voted by other means set out on the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November to cast their votes. Several weeks later, the electoral votes are counted and the president is formally elected (Figure 12.8).

[.my2]
大选通常包括总统候选人之间的一系列辩论以及副总统候选人之间的辩论。由于事关重大，各方都会投入大量资金和资源。试图控制现代大选竞选活动不断攀升的成本的努力已被证明收效甚微。公共资金也未能解决这个问题。事实上，自从巴拉克· 奥巴马在 2008 年决定放弃公共资金以规避支出限制以来，候选人现在通常选择筹集更多资金而不是接受公共资金。此外，政治行动委员会（PAC）本应关注议题而非特定候选人，但它们却试图根据自身利益支持或反对候选人，从而影响选举结果。 然而 ，在所有支出和辩论结束后，那些尚未通过其他方式投票的选民会在 11 月第一个星期一之后的第一个星期二前往投票站投票。几周后，选举人票将被清点，总统正式当选（ 图 12.8 ）。

This flow chart is called “How to Become President of the United States.” It begins with the U.S. constitution’s requirements for a presidential candidate: natural born citizenship, a minimum age of 35 years, and 14 years of U.S. residency. Step 1 is titled “Primaries and Caucuses.” The chart says “There are many people who want to be President, each with their own ideas about how government should work. People with similar ideas belong to the same political party. This is where primaries and caucuses come in. Candidates from each political party campaign through the country to win the favor of their party members. In a caucus, party members select the best candidate through a series of discussions and votes. In a primary, party members vote for the best candidate that will represent them in the general election.” Step 2 is titled “National Conventions.” The chart says “Each party holds a national convention to select a final presidential nominee. At each convention, the presidential candidate chooses a running mate (Vice Presidential candidate). The presidential candidates campaign throughout the country to win the support of the general population.” Step 3 is titled “General Election.” The chart says “People in every state across the country vote for one President and Vice President. When people cast their vote, they are actually voting for a group of people known as elector.” Step 4 is titled “Electoral College.” The chart says “In the electoral college system, each state gets a certain number of electors based on its representation in Congress. Each elector casts one vote following the general election, and the candidate who gets more than half (270) wins. The newly elected President and Vice President are inaugurated in January.”
