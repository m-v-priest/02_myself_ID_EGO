== 释义




At some point, most of us have found ourselves part of a group trying to solve a problem, like picking a restaurant or movie to attend, or completing a big project at school or work. Members of the group probably had various opinions about what should be done. Some may have even refused to help make the decision or to follow it once it had been made. Still others may have been willing to follow along but were less interested in contributing to a workable solution. Because of this disagreement, at some point, someone in the group had to find a way to make a decision, negotiate a compromise, and ultimately do the work needed for the group to accomplish its goals.

我们大多数人都曾有过这样的经历：参与一个团队，共同解决某个问题，比如选择去哪家餐厅吃饭或看哪部电影，或者完成学校或工作中的某个大型项目。团队成员可能对应该怎么做各执己见。有些人甚至可能拒绝参与决策，或者在决策做出后拒绝执行。还有一些人可能愿意参与，但却不太愿意为可行的解决方案贡献力量。正因为存在这种分歧，团队中总得有人挺身而出，做出决定，协商妥协，并最终完成团队实现目标所需的工作。

This kind of collective action problem is very common in societies, as groups and entire societies try to solve problems or distribute scarce resources. In modern U.S. politics, such problems are usually solved by two important types of organizations: interest groups and political parties. There are many interest groups, all with opinions about what should be done and a desire to influence policy. Because they are usually not officially affiliated with any political party, they generally have no trouble working with either of the major parties. But at some point, a society must find a way of taking all these opinions and turning them into solutions to real problems. That is where political parties come in. Essentially, political parties are groups of people with similar interests who work together to create and implement policies. They do this by gaining control over the government by winning elections. Party platforms guide members of Congress in drafting legislation. Parties guide proposed laws through Congress and inform party members how they should vote on important issues. Political parties also nominate candidates to run for state government, Congress, and the presidency. Finally, they coordinate political campaigns and mobilize voters.

这种集体行动困境在社会中非常普遍，因为群体乃至整个社会都在努力解决问题或分配稀缺资源。在现代美国政治中，这类问题通常由两类重要的组织来解决：利益集团和政党。利益集团众多，它们都对应该采取的行动持有意见，并渴望影响政策。由于它们通常不正式隶属于任何政党，因此与两大政党合作通常不成问题。但社会最终必须找到一种方法，将所有这些意见转化为解决实际问题方案。这就是政党的作用所在。本质上， 政党是由具有相似利益的人们组成的团体，他们共同制定和实施政策。他们通过赢得选举来掌控政府。政党纲领指导国会议员起草立法。政党引导提案在国会获得通过，并告知党员在重要议题上应该如何投票。政党还提名候选人竞选州政府、国会和总统职位。最后，他们协调政治竞选活动并动员选民。

POLITICAL PARTIES AS UNIQUE ORGANIZATIONS
政党作为独特的组织
In Federalist No. 10, written in the late eighteenth century, James Madison noted that the formation of self-interested groups, which he called factions, was inevitable in any society, as individuals started to work together to protect themselves from the government. Interest groups and political parties are two of the most easily identified forms of factions in the United States. These groups are similar in that they are both mediating institutions responsible for communicating public preferences to the government. They are not themselves government institutions in a formal sense. Neither is directly mentioned in the U.S. Constitution nor do they have any real, legal authority to influence policy. But whereas interest groups often work indirectly to influence our leaders, political parties are organizations that try to directly influence public policy through its members who seek to win and hold public office. Parties accomplish this by identifying and aligning sets of issues that are important to voters in the hopes of gaining support during elections; their positions on these critical issues are often presented in documents known as a party platform (Figure 9.2), which is adopted at each party’s presidential nominating convention every four years. If successful, a party can create a large enough electoral coalition to gain control of the government. Once in power, the party is then able to deliver, to its voters and elites, the policy preferences they choose by electing its partisans to the government. In this respect, parties provide choices to the electorate, something they are doing that is in such sharp contrast to their opposition.

在十八世纪末撰写的 《联邦党人文集 》第十篇中，詹姆斯 ·麦迪逊指出，在任何社会中，自利团体（他称之为派系）的形成都是不可避免的，因为人们开始联合起来保护自己免受政府的侵害。利益集团和政党是美国最容易识别的两种派系形式。这些团体相似之处在于，它们都是负责向政府传达公众意愿的中介机构。它们本身并非正式意义上的政府机构。美国宪法中既没有直接提及它们，也没有赋予它们任何影响政策的真正法律权力。然而，利益集团通常通过间接方式影响领导人，而政党则是试图通过其成员赢得并维持公职来直接影响公共政策的组织。政党通过识别和协调一系列对选民至关重要的议题来​​实现这一目标，以期在选举中获得支持；它们在这些关键议题上的立场通常体现在被称为 “党纲” （ 图 9.2 ）的文件中，该党纲每四年在一次总统候选人提名大会上通过。如果成功，一个政党就能建立足够庞大的选举联盟，从而掌控政府。一旦执政，该党就能通过选举其支持者进入政府，向选民和精英阶层推行他们所选择的政策。从这个意义上讲，政党为选民提供了选择，这与反对党形成了鲜明的对比。

Winning elections and implementing policy would be hard enough in simple political systems, but in a country as complex as the United States, political parties must take on great responsibilities to win elections and coordinate behavior across the many local, state, and national governing bodies. Indeed, political differences between states and local areas can contribute much complexity. If a party stakes out issue positions on which few people agree and therefore builds too narrow a coalition of voter support, that party may find itself marginalized. But if the party takes too broad a position on issues, it might find itself in a situation where the members of the party disagree with one another, making it difficult to pass legislation, even if the party can secure victory.

在简单的政治体制中，赢得选举和推行政策已属不易，但在美国这样复杂的国家，政党必须承担起赢得选举和协调各级政府机构行为的重任。事实上，各州和地方之间的政治分歧会加剧局势的复杂性。如果一个政党在一些鲜有人认同的议题上采取立场，从而建立起过于狭窄的选民支持联盟，那么该党可能会被边缘化。但如果该党在一些议题上采取过于宽泛的立场，则可能导致党内成员意见相左，即使最终赢得选举，也难以通过立法。

It should come as no surprise that the story of U.S. political parties largely mirrors the story of the United States itself. The United States has seen sweeping changes to its size, its relative power, and its social and demographic composition. These changes have been mirrored by the political parties as they have sought to shift their coalitions to establish and maintain power across the nation and as party leadership has changed. As you will learn later, this also means that the structure and behavior of modern parties largely parallel the social, demographic, and geographic divisions within the United States today. To understand how this has happened, we look at the origins of the U.S. party system.

美国政党的发展历程与美国自身的发展历程在很大程度上相呼应，这一点不足为奇。美国的国土面积、相对实力以及社会和人口结构都经历了翻天覆地的变化。这些变化也反映在各政党身上，它们不断调整联盟以在全国范围内建立和维持权力，同时党内领导层也几经更迭。正如你将在后文中了解到的，这也意味着现代政党的结构和行为在很大程度上反映了当今美国的社会、人口和地域分化。为了理解这一切是如何发生的，我们将追溯美国政党制度的起源。

HOW POLITICAL PARTIES FORMED
政党是如何形成的
National political parties as we understand them today did not really exist in the United States during the early years of the republic. Most politics during the time of the nation’s founding were local in nature and based on elite politics, limited suffrage (or the ability to vote in elections), and property ownership. Residents of the various colonies, and later of the various states, were far more interested in events in their state legislatures than in those occurring at the national level or later in the nation’s capital. To the extent that national issues did exist, they were largely limited to collective security efforts to deal with external rivals, such as the British or the French, and with perceived internal threats, such as conflicts with Native Americans.

[.my2]
我们今天所理解的全国性政党在美国建国初期并不存在。建国初期的大部分政治活动都以地方政治为主，以精英政治、有限的选举权（或投票权）和财产所有权为基础。各殖民地居民，以及后来的各州居民，对本州立法机构的事务远比对国家层面或后来的首都发生的事件更感兴趣。即便存在全国性议题，也主要局限于应对外部对手（如英国或法国）和内部威胁（如与美洲原住民的冲突）的集体安全行动。

Soon after the United States emerged from the Revolutionary War, however, a rift began to emerge between two groups that had very different views about the future direction of U.S. politics. Thus, from the very beginning of its history, the United States has had a system of government dominated by two different philosophies. Federalists, who were largely responsible for drafting and ratifying the U.S. Constitution, generally favored the idea of a stronger, more centralized republic that had greater control over regulating the economy.1 Anti-Federalists preferred a more confederate system built on state equality and autonomy.2 The Federalist faction, led by Alexander Hamilton, largely dominated the government in the years immediately after the Constitution was ratified. Included in the Federalists was President George Washington, who was initially against the existence of parties in the United States. When Washington decided to exit politics and leave office, he warned of the potential negative effects of parties in his farewell address to the nation, including their potentially divisive nature and the fact that they might not always focus on the common good but rather on partisan ends. However, members of each faction quickly realized that they had a vested interest not only in nominating and electing a president who shared their views, but also in winning other elections. Two loosely affiliated party coalitions, known as the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans, soon emerged. The Federalists succeeded in electing their first leader, John Adams, to the presidency in 1796, only to see the Democratic-Republicans gain victory under Thomas Jefferson four years later in 1800.

[.my2]
然而，美国独立战争结束后不久，两个对美国政治未来走向持有截然不同观点的群体之间便开始出现裂痕。因此，从建国之初，美国就一直处于两种不同政治理念主导的政府体制之下。 联邦党人主要负责起草和批准美国宪法，他们普遍倾向于建立一个更强大、更中央集权的共和国，以便更好地监管经济。 1 反联邦党人则更倾向于建立在各州平等和自治基础上的邦联制。 2 以亚历山大 ·汉密尔顿为首的联邦党派在宪法批准后的最初几年里几乎完全掌控了政府。乔治 ·华盛顿总统也属于联邦党人，他最初反对美国存在政党。当华盛顿决定退出政坛并卸任时，他在告别演说中警告了政党可能带来的负面影响，包括其潜在的分裂性以及政党可能并非总是以公共利益为中心，而是以党派利益为导向。然而，各派系成员很快意识到，他们不仅要提名和选举一位与自己观点一致的总统，还要赢得其他选举，这都与他们自身利益息息相关。两个松散的政党联盟——联邦党人和民主共和党人 ——很快形成。 联邦党人于 1796 年成功选举他们的第一位领导人约翰 ·亚当斯担任总统，但四年后的 1800 年，民主共和党在托马斯· 杰斐逊的领导下取得了胜利。

Milestone  里程碑
The “Revolution of 1800”: Uniting the Executive Branch under One Party
“1800年革命”：将行政部门统一于一党之下
When the U.S. Constitution was drafted, its authors were certainly aware that political parties existed in other countries (like Great Britain), but they hoped to avoid them in the United States. They felt the importance of states in the U.S. federal structure would make it difficult for national parties to form. They also hoped that having a college of electors vote for the executive branch, with the top two vote-getters becoming president and vice president, would discourage the formation of parties. Their system worked for the first two presidential elections, when essentially all the electors voted for George Washington to serve as president. But by 1796, the Federalist and Anti-Federalist camps had organized into electoral coalitions. The Anti-Federalists joined with many others active in the process to become known as the Democratic-Republicans. The Federalist John Adams won the Electoral College vote, but his authority was undermined when the vice presidency went to Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson, who finished second. Four years later, the Democratic-Republicans managed to avoid this outcome by coordinating the electors to vote for their top two candidates. But when the vote ended in a tie, it was ultimately left to Congress to decide who would be the third president of the United States (Figure 9.3).

[.my2]
美国宪法起草之时，其制定者当然知道其他国家（例如英国）存在政党，但他们希望美国能够避免出现政党。他们认为，各州在美国联邦体制中的重要性将使全国性政党难以形成。他们还希望，由选举人团投票选举行政部门，得票最高的两位候选人分别担任总统和副总统，能够抑制政党的形成。他们的制度在前两届总统选举中奏效，几乎所有选举人都投票支持乔治·华盛顿担任总统。但到了 1796 年，联邦党人和反联邦党人已经组成了选举联盟。反联邦党人与许多其他积极参与选举进程的人联合起来，组成了后来的民主共和党。联邦党人约翰·亚当斯赢得了选举人团的投票，但由于副总统职位落到了得票第二的民主共和党人托马斯·杰斐逊手中，他的权威受到了削弱。四年后，民主共和党人通过协调选举人投票支持他们得票最高的两名候选人，成功避免了这种情况的发生。但当投票结果出现平局时，最终还是由国会来决定谁将成为美国第三任总统（ 图 9.3 ）。

图 9.3 托马斯·杰斐逊在 1800 年的总统选举中差点输给了自己的竞选伙伴，因为选举团的设计缺陷导致了平局，不得不由国会来解决。
In an effort to prevent a similar outcome in the future, Congress and the states voted to ratify the Twelfth Amendment, which went into effect in 1804. This amendment changed the rules so that the president and vice president would be selected through separate elections within the Electoral College, and it altered the method that Congress used to fill the offices in the event that no candidate won a majority. The amendment essentially endorsed the new party system and helped prevent future controversies. It also served as an early effort by the two parties to collude to make it harder for an outsider to win the presidency.

[.my2]
为了防止未来再次出现类似情况，国会和各州投票批准了第十二修正案，该修正案于1804年生效。这项修正案修改了选举规则，规定总统和副总统将通过选举团分别选举产生，并改变了在没有候选人获得多数票的情况下国会填补空缺职位的方式。该修正案实际上认可了新的政党制度，并有助于防止未来的争议。它也被视为两党早期联手阻止非本党候选人赢得总统职位的尝试。

Does the process of selecting the executive branch need to be reformed so that the people elect the president and vice president directly, rather than through the Electoral College? Should the people vote separately on each office rather than voting for both at the same time? Explain your reasoning.

[.my2]
行政部门的选举程序是否需要改革，使人民能够直接选举总统和副总统，而不是通过选举团？人民是否应该分别投票选举总统和副总统，而不是同时投票选举两者？请解释你的理由。

Growing regional tensions eroded the Federalist Party’s ability to coordinate elites, and it eventually collapsed following its opposition to the War of 1812.3 The Democratic-Republican Party, on the other hand, eventually divided over whether national resources should be focused on economic and mercantile development, such as tariffs on imported goods and government funding of internal improvements like roads and canals, or on promoting populist issues that would help the “common man,” such as reducing or eliminating state property requirements that had prevented many men from voting.4
日益加剧的地区紧张局势削弱了联邦党协调精英的能力，最终，由于反对 1812 年战争，该党走向瓦解。 3 另一方面，民主共和党最终在国家资源的分配问题上出现分歧：是应该集中用于经济和商业发展，例如对进口商品征收关税以及政府资助道路和运河等国内建设；还是应该集中用于推动有利于“普通民众”的民粹主义议题，例如减少或取消阻碍许多男性投票的州财产要求。 4

In the election of 1824, numerous candidates contended for the presidency, all members of the Democratic-Republican Party. Andrew Jackson won more popular votes and more votes in the Electoral College than any other candidate. However, because he did not win the majority (more than half) of the available electoral votes, the election was decided by the House of Representatives, as required by the Twelfth Amendment. The Twelfth Amendment limited the House’s choice to the three candidates with the greatest number of electoral votes. Thus, Andrew Jackson, with 99 electoral votes, found himself in competition with only John Quincy Adams, the second place finisher with 84 electoral votes, and William H. Crawford, who had come in third with 41. The fourth-place finisher, Henry Clay, who was no longer in contention, had won 37 electoral votes. Clay strongly disliked Jackson, and his ideas on government support for tariffs and internal improvements were similar to those of Adams. Clay thus gave his support to Adams, who was chosen on the first ballot. Jackson considered the actions of Clay and Adams, the son of the Federalist president John Adams, to be an unjust triumph of supporters of the elite and referred to it as “the corrupt bargain.”5
1824 年总统大选中，众多候选人角逐总统宝座，他们均属于民主共和党。安德鲁 ·杰克逊赢得了比其他任何候选人都多的普选票和选举人团票。然而，由于他没有赢得超过半数的选举人票，根据第十二修正案的规定，总统最终由众议院决定。第十二修正案规定，众议院只能在获得最多选举人票的三位候选人中选出总统。因此，获得 99 张选举人票的安德鲁·杰克逊，最终的竞争对手只有获得 84 张选举人票的第二名约翰·昆西·亚当斯和获得 41 张选举人票的第三名威廉·H·克劳福德。排名第四的亨利·克莱获得了 37 张选举人票，由于他已退出竞选，因此无法再次参选。克莱非常厌恶杰克逊，他在政府支持关税和内部建设方面的想法与亚当斯相似。因此，克莱支持亚当斯，亚当斯在第一轮投票中就当选。杰克逊认为克莱和亚当斯（联邦党总统约翰·亚当斯的儿子）的行为是精英支持者的不公正胜利，并称之为“腐败的交易” 。⁵

This marked the beginning of what historians call the Second Party System (the first parties had been the Federalists and the Jeffersonian Republicans), with the splitting of the Democratic-Republicans and the formation of two new political parties. One half, called simply the Democratic Party, was the party of Jackson; it continued to advocate for the common people by championing westward expansion and opposing a national bank. The branch of the Democratic-Republicans that believed that the national government should encourage economic (primarily industrial) development was briefly known as the National Republicans and later became the Whig Party6. In the election of 1828, Democrat Andrew Jackson was triumphant. Three times as many people voted in 1828 as had in 1824, and most cast their ballots for him.7
这标志着历史学家所称的第二政党体系的开始（第一政党是联邦党和杰斐逊共和党），民主共和党分裂，两个新政党成立。其中一半，简称为民主党，是杰克逊的政党；它继续代表普通民众的利益，支持西进运动，反对建立国家银行。民主共和党中主张联邦政府应鼓励经济（主要是工业）发展的派别，曾短暂被称为国民共和党，后来发展成为辉格党 。在 1828 年的总统选举中，民主党人安德鲁·杰克逊获胜。1828 年的投票人数是 1824 年的三倍，而且大多数选民都投票给了他。

The formation of the Democratic Party marked an important shift in U.S. politics. Rather than being built largely to coordinate elite behavior, the Democratic Party worked to organize the electorate by taking advantage of state-level laws that had extended suffrage from male property owners to nearly all White men.8 This change marked the birth of what is often considered the first modern political party in any democracy in the world.9 It also dramatically changed the way party politics was, and still is, conducted. For one thing, this new party organization was built to include structures that focused on organizing and mobilizing voters for elections at all levels of government. The party also perfected an existing spoils system, in which support for the party during elections was rewarded with jobs in the government bureaucracy after victory.10 Many of these positions were given to party bosses and their friends. These men were the leaders of political machines, organizations that secured votes for the party’s candidates or supported the party in other ways. Perhaps more importantly, this election-focused organization also sought to maintain power by creating a broader coalition and thereby expanding the range of issues upon which the party was constructed.11
民主党的成立标志着美国政治的一次重大转变。民主党不再主要致力于协调精英阶层的行为，而是利用各州法律扩大了选举权范围，将选举权从男性财产所有者扩展到几乎所有白人男性，从而致力于组织选民。 8 这一变化标志着通常被认为是世界上任何民主国家中第一个现代政党的诞生。 9 它也极大地改变了政党政治的运作方式，并且这种改变至今仍然存在。一方面，这个新的政党组织旨在建立专注于组织和动员选民参与各级政府选举的结构。该党还完善了现有的分赃制度，即在选举中支持该党的人将在胜选后获得政府官僚机构的职位作为奖励。 10 许多这样的职位都给了党魁及其亲信。这些人是政治机器的领导者，这些组织负责为党的候选人争取选票或以其他方式支持该党。或许更重要的是，这个以选举为中心的组织还试图通过建立更广泛的联盟来维持权力，从而扩大该党赖以建立的议题范围 。11

The Democratic Party emphasized personal politics, which focused on building direct relationships with voters rather than on promoting specific issues. This party dominated national politics from Andrew Jackson’s presidential victory in 1828 until the mid-1850s, when regional tensions began to threaten the nation’s very existence. The growing power of industrialists, who preferred greater national authority, combined with increasing tensions between the northern and southern states over slavery, led to the rise of the Republican Party and its leader Abraham Lincoln in the election of 1860, while the Democratic Party dominated in the South. Like the Democrats, the Republicans also began to utilize a mass approach to party design and organization. Their opposition to the expansion of slavery, and their role in helping to stabilize the Union during Reconstruction, made them the dominant player in national politics for the next several decades.12
民主党强调个人政治 ，注重与选民建立直接联系，而非宣传具体议题。从安德鲁·杰克逊 1828 年赢得总统大选到 19 世纪 50 年代中期，民主党一直主导着美国政坛。直到地区间的紧张局势开始威胁到国家的存亡，民主党才逐渐崛起。工业家的势力日益壮大，他们倾向于更大的国家权力；加之南北各州之间在奴隶制问题上的矛盾日益激化，最终导致共和党及其领袖亚伯拉罕·林肯在 1860 年的总统大选中崛起，而民主党则在南方占据主导地位。与民主党一样，共和党也开始采用群众性的党组织方式。他们反对奴隶制的扩张，并在重建时期为稳定联邦发挥了重要作用，这使得他们在接下来的几十年里成为美国政坛的主导力量。

The Democratic and Republican parties have remained the two dominant players in the U.S. party system since the Civil War (1861–1865). That does not mean, however, that the system has been stagnant. Every political actor and all citizens have the ability to determine for themselves whether one of the two parties meets their needs and provides an appealing set of policy options, or whether another option is preferable.

[.my2]
自美国内战（1861-1865）以来，民主党和共和党一直是美国政党体系中的两大主导力量。但这并不意味着该体系停滞不前。每一位政治参与者和每一位公民都有能力自行判断，两大政党中哪一个能够满足他们的需求，并提供一套吸引人的政策选择，或者是否有其他更合适的选择。

At various points in the past 170 years, elites and voters have sought to create alternatives to the existing party system. Political parties that are formed as alternatives to the Republican and Democratic parties are known as third parties, or minor parties (Figure 9.4). In 1892, a third party known as the Populist Party formed in reaction to what its constituents perceived as the domination of U.S. society by big business and a decline in the power of farmers and rural communities. The Populist Party called for the regulation of railroads, an income tax, and the popular election of U.S. senators, who at this time were chosen by state legislatures and not by ordinary voters.13 The party’s candidate in the 1892 elections, James B. Weaver, did not perform as well as the two main party candidates, and, in the presidential election of 1896, the Populists supported the Democratic candidate William Jennings Bryan. Bryan lost, and the Populists once again nominated their own presidential candidates in 1900, 1904, and 1908. The party disappeared from the national scene after 1908, but its ideas were similar to those of the Progressive Party, a new political party created in 1912.

[.my2]
在过去 170 年的不同时期，精英阶层和选民都曾试图建立替代现有政党体系的方案。作为共和党和民主党的替代方案而成立的政党被称为第三党或小党（ 图 9.4 ）。1892 年，一个名为民粹党的第三党成立，其成立的初衷是反对其支持者认为美国社会被大企业主导以及农民和农村社区权力衰落的现状。民粹党呼吁对铁路进行监管、征收所得税，并实行美国参议员的普选制——当时的参议员是由州议会而非普通选民选举产生的。 13 1892 年大选中，该党候选人詹姆斯·B·韦弗的表现不如两大党候选人。在 1896 年的总统选举中，民粹党转而支持民主党候选人威廉·詹宁斯·布莱恩。布莱恩落败后，民粹党在 1900 年、1904 年和 1908 年再次提名了自己的总统候选人。该党在 1908 年后从国家政治舞台上消失，但其理念与 1912 年成立的新政党进步党的理念相似。

In 1912 the Bull Moose (Progressive) party won 27%, and the Socialist party won 6%. In 1924 the Progressive party won 17%. In 1948 the States’ Rights (Dixiecrat) party won 2%, and the Progressive party won 2%. In 1968 the American Independent party won 14%. In 1980 the National Unity party won 7%. In 1992 the Reform party won 19%. In 1996 the Reform party won 8%. In 2000 the Green party won 3%. In 2008, the Reform party won less than 1%.” In 2012, the Libertarian party won 1%. In 2016, the Libertarian party won 3% and the Green party won 1%. In 2020, the Libertarian party won 1%.

Figure 9.4 Various third parties, also known as minor parties, have appeared in the United States over the years. Some, like the Socialist Party, still exist in one form or another. Others, like the Anti-Masonic Party, which wanted to protect the United States from the influence of the Masonic fraternal order and garnered just under 8 percent of the popular vote in 1832, are gone.

图 9.4 多年来，美国出现了各种第三党，也称小党。有些党，例如社会党，至今仍以某种形式存在。而另一些党，例如反共济会党（该党旨在保护美国免受共济会的影响，并在 1832 年获得了近 8% 的普选票），则已经消失。
In 1912, former Republican president Theodore Roosevelt attempted to form a third party, known as the Progressive Party, as an alternative to the more business-minded Republicans. The Progressives sought to correct the many problems that had arisen as the United States transformed itself from a rural, agricultural nation into an increasingly urbanized, industrialized country dominated by big business interests. Among the reforms that the Progressive Party called for in its 1912 platform were women’s suffrage, an eight-hour workday, and workers’ compensation. The party also favored some of the same reforms as the Populist Party, such as the direct election of U.S. senators and an income tax, although Populists tended to be farmers while the Progressives were from the middle class. In general, Progressives sought to make government more responsive to the will of the people and to end political corruption in government. They wished to break the power of party bosses and political machines, and called upon states to pass laws allowing voters to vote directly on proposed legislation, propose new laws, and recall from office incompetent or corrupt elected officials. The Progressive Party largely disappeared after 1916, and most members returned to the Republican Party.14 The party enjoyed a brief resurgence in 1924, when Robert “Fighting Bob” La Follette ran unsuccessfully for president under the Progressive banner.

1912年，前共和党总统西奥多 罗斯福试图组建第三党—— 进步党 ，以区别于更注重商业利益的共和党。进步党力图纠正美国从一个以农业为主的乡村国家转型为一个日益城市化、工业化且被大企业利益集团主导的国家过程中出现的诸多问题。进步党在其 1912 年的党纲中提出的改革措施包括妇女选举权、八小时工作制和工伤赔偿。该党也支持一些与民粹党相同的改革，例如美国参议员的直接选举和所得税，尽管民粹党成员多为农民，而进步党成员则来自中产阶级。总的来说，进步党力求使政府更能回应人民的意愿，并根除政府中的政治腐败。他们希望打破党魁和政治机器的权力，并呼吁各州通过法律，允许选民直接投票表决立法提案、提出新法律，以及罢免不称职或腐败的民选官员。进步党在 1916 年后基本销声匿迹，大多数成员重新加入共和党。14 1924 年，该党曾短暂复兴，当时罗伯特·“战斗鲍勃”·拉福莱特以进步党候选人的身份竞选总统，但最终落败。

In 1948, two new third parties appeared on the political scene. Henry A. Wallace, a vice president under Franklin Roosevelt, formed a new Progressive Party, which had little in common with the earlier Progressive Party. Wallace favored racial desegregation and believed that the United States should have closer ties to the Soviet Union. Wallace’s campaign was a failure, largely because most people believed his policies, including national healthcare, were too much like those of communism, and this party also vanished. The other third party, the States’ Rights Democrats, also known as the Dixiecrats, were White, southern Democrats who split from the Democratic Party when Harry Truman, who favored civil rights for African Americans, became the party’s nominee for president. The Dixiecrats opposed all attempts by the federal government to end segregation, extend voting rights, prohibit discrimination in employment, or otherwise promote social equality among races.15 They remained a significant party that threatened Democratic unity throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Other examples of third parties in the United States include the American Independent Party, the Libertarian Party, United We Stand America, the Reform Party, and the Green Party.

1948 年，两个新的第三党出现在政坛。富兰克林·罗斯福的副总统亨利·A· 华莱士组建了新的进步党，该党与之前的进步党几乎没有共同之处。华莱士支持种族融合，并认为美国应该与苏联建立更紧密的联系。华莱士的竞选以失败告终，主要原因是大多数人认为他的政策，包括全民医保，与共产主义过于相似，该党也随之消失。另一个第三党是州权民主党人，也被称为迪克西民主党人 ，他们由南方白人民主党人组成。当支持非裔美国人民权的哈里 ·杜鲁门成为民主党总统候选人时，他们脱离了民主党。迪克西民主党人反对联邦政府所有旨在结束种族隔离、扩大投票权、禁止就业歧视或以其他方式促进种族平等的努力。 15 在整个 20 世纪 50 年代和 60 年代，他们一直是威胁民主党团结的重要政党。美国其他第三党的例子包括美国独立党、自由党、团结美国党、改革党和绿党。

None of these alternatives to the two major political parties had much success at the national level, and most are no longer viable parties. All faced the same fate. Formed by charismatic leaders, each championed a relatively narrow set of causes and failed to gain broad support among the electorate. Once their leaders had been defeated or discredited, the party structures that were built to contest elections collapsed. And within a few years, most of their supporters were eventually pulled back into one of the existing parties. To be sure, some of these parties had an electoral impact. For example, the Progressive Party pulled enough votes away from the Republicans to hand the 1912 election to the Democrats. Thus, the third-party rival’s principal accomplishment was helping its least-preferred major party win, usually at the short-term expense of the very issue it championed. In the long run, however, many third parties have brought important issues to the attention of the major parties, which then incorporated these issues into their platforms. Understanding why this is the case is an important next step in learning about the issues and strategies of the modern Republican and Democratic parties. In the next section, we look at why the United States has historically been dominated by only two political parties.

这些替代两大政党的政党在全国层面都鲜有建树，大多数如今已不复存在。它们都面临着同样的命运：由魅力型领袖组建，各自倡导的议题相对狭窄，未能赢得选民的广泛支持。一旦领袖落败或声名狼藉，为参与选举而建立的政党结构便土崩瓦解。几年之内，它们的大多数支持者最终都被拉回了现有政党。诚然，其中一些政党也曾对选举产生过影响。例如，进步党从共和党手中夺取了足够多的选票，最终使民主党赢得了1912年的总统大选。因此，第三方政党的主要成就是帮助其最不青睐的两大政党赢得选举，而这通常是以牺牲其自身所倡导的议题为代价的。然而，从长远来看，许多第三方政党已将一些重要议题提交给两大政党，而两大政党随后将这些问题纳入了自身的政治纲领。理解个中缘由是深入了解现代共和党和民主党的议题和策略的重要一步。下一节，我们将探讨美国历史上为何一直由两大政党主导。
