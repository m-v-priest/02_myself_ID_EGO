== 释义




While attitudes and beliefs are slow to change, ideology can be influenced by events. A student might leave college with a liberal ideology but become more conservative as she ages. A first-year teacher may view unions with suspicion based on second-hand information but change his mind after reading newsletters and attending union meetings. These shifts may change the way citizens vote and the answers they give in polls. For this reason, political scientists often study when and why such changes in ideology happen, and how they influence our opinions about government and politicians.

尽管态度和信念的改变较为缓慢，但意识形态却会受到事件的影响。例如，一名学生大学毕业时可能持有自由主义意识形态，但随着年龄增长，她的意识形态可能会变得更加保守。一名新教师最初可能基于二手信息对工会抱有怀疑态度，但在阅读工会简报并参加工会会议后，他的看法可能会发生改变。这些转变可能会影响公民的投票方式以及他们在民意调查中的回答。因此，政治学家经常研究意识形态转变发生的时间和原因，以及这些转变如何影响我们对政府和政治家的看法。

EXPERIENCES THAT AFFECT PUBLIC OPINION
影响公众舆论的经历
Ideological shifts are more likely to occur if a voter’s ideology is only weakly supported by their beliefs. Citizens can also hold beliefs or opinions that are contrary or conflicting, especially if their knowledge of an issue or candidate is limited. And having limited information makes it easier for them to abandon an opinion. Finally, citizens’ opinions will change as they grow older and separate from family.47
如果选民的意识形态与其信念之间缺乏紧密联系，那么意识形态的转变就更容易发生。公民也可能持有相反或冲突的信念或观点，尤其是在他们对某个议题或候选人了解有限的情况下。而信息匮乏会使他们更容易放弃原有的观点。最后，随着年龄增长和与家庭分离，公民的观点也会发生变化 。47

Citizens use two methods to form an opinion about an issue or candidate. The first is to rely on heuristics, shortcuts or generalizations (cues) for decision making. Political party membership is one of the most common heuristics in voting. Many voters join a political party whose platform aligns most closely with their political beliefs, and voting for a candidate from that party simply makes sense. A Republican candidate will likely espouse conservative beliefs, such as smaller government and lower taxes, that are often more appealing to a Republican voter. Studies have shown that up to half of voters make decisions using their political party identification, or party ID, especially in races where information about candidates is scarce.48
公民通常使用两种方法来形成对某个议题或候选人的看法。第一种方法是依赖启发式方法 ，即捷径或概括（线索）来进行决策。政党成员身份是投票中最常见的启发式方法之一。许多选民会加入政纲与自身政治信仰最契合的政党，投票给该党的候选人也就顺理成章了。共和党候选人通常会拥护保守主义理念，例如小政府和低税收，这些理念往往更能吸引共和党选民。研究表明，多达一半的选民会根据其政党认同（即党派身份）来做决定，尤其是在候选人信息匮乏的选举中。 48

In non-partisan and some local elections, where candidates are not permitted to list their party identifications, voters may have to rely on a candidate’s background or job description to form a quick opinion of a candidate’s suitability. A candidate for judge may list “criminal prosecutor” as current employment, leaving the voter to determine whether a prosecutor would make a good judge.

[.my2]
在无党派选举和一些地方选举中，候选人不得列出党派身份，选民可能只能依靠候选人的背景或职业描述来快速判断其是否胜任。例如，法官候选人可能会将“刑事检察官”列为目前的职业，这就让选民自行判断检察官是否适合担任法官。

The second method is to do research, learning background information before making a decision. Candidates, parties, and campaigns put out a large array of information to sway potential voters, and the media provide wide coverage, all of which is readily available online and elsewhere. But many voters are unwilling to spend the necessary time to research and instead vote with incomplete information.49
第二种方法是进行研究，在做决定前了解背景信息。候选人、政党和竞选活动会发布大量信息来影响潜在选民，媒体也会进行广泛报道，所有这些信息都可以在网上和其他地方轻松获取。但许多选民不愿意花时间进行必要的研究，而是凭不完整的信息投票 。49

Gender, race, socio-economic status, and interest-group affiliation also serve as heuristics for decision making. Voters may assume women candidates have a stronger understanding about social issues relevant to women. Business owners may prefer to vote for a candidate with a college degree who has worked in business rather than a career politician. Other voters may look to see which candidate is endorsed by Planned Parenthood, because Planned Parenthood's endorsement will ensure the candidate supports abortion rights.

[.my2]
性别、种族、社会经济地位和利益集团归属也会影响选民的决策。选民可能认为女性候选人对与女性相关的社会议题有更深入的了解。企业主可能更倾向于投票给拥有大学学历且在商界工作过的候选人，而不是职业政客。还有一些选民会关注候选人是否获得了美国计划生育协会（Planned Parenthood）的支持，因为计划生育协会的支持意味着该候选人支持堕胎权。

Opinions based on heuristics rather than research are more likely to change when the cue changes. If a voter begins listening to a new source of information or moves to a new town, the influences and cues they meet will change. Even if the voter is diligently looking for information to make an informed decision, demographic cues matter. Age, gender, race, and socio-economic status will shape our opinions because they are a part of our everyday reality, and they become part of our barometer on whether a leader or government is performing well.

[.my2]
基于经验而非研究的观点更容易随着信息来源的变化而改变。如果选民开始关注新的信息来源或搬到新的城镇，他们所接触到的影响因素和信息线索都会发生变化。即使选民认真寻找信息以做出明智的决定，人口统计因素仍然至关重要。年龄、性别、种族和社会经济地位会影响我们的观点，因为它们是我们日常生活的一部分，也成为我们衡量领导人或政府表现的晴雨表。

A look at the 2020 presidential election shows how the opinions of different demographic groups vary (Figure 6.12). For instance, 57 percent of women voted for Joe Biden and 53 percent of men voted for Donald Trump. Age mattered as well—60 percent of voters under thirty voted for Biden, whereas 52 percent of those over sixty-five voted for Trump. Racial groups also varied in their support of the candidates. Eighty-seven percent of African Americans and 65 percent of Hispanics voted for Biden instead of Trump. These demographic effects are likely to be strong because of shared experiences, concerns, and ideas. Citizens who are comfortable with one another will talk more and share opinions, leading to more opportunities to influence or reinforce one another.

[.my2]
2020 年总统大选的结果显示，不同人口群体的意见存在显著差异（ 图 6.12 ）。例如，57%的女性投票支持乔·拜登，而 53%的男性投票支持唐纳德·特朗普。年龄也是一个重要因素——30 岁以下的选民中有 60%投票支持拜登，而 65 岁以上的选民中有 52%投票支持特朗普。不同种族群体对候选人的支持也存在差异。87%的非裔美国人和 65%的拉丁裔选民投票支持拜登而非特朗普。这些人口统计学因素的影响可能较为显著，因为他们拥有共同的经历、关注点和理念。彼此熟悉的公民会更多地交流和分享观点，从而有更多机会相互影响或强化彼此的观点。

A group of charts show how groups voted in the 2024 presidential election. When divided by gender, 43% of men voted for Biden, and 55% voted for Trump, while 53% of women voted for Biden and 45% voted for Trump. When divided by race, 86% of African American people voted for Biden while 13% voted for Trump; 55% of Asian people voted for Biden while 40% voted for Trump; 51% of Hispanics voted for Biden while 46% voted for Trump; 42% of White people voted for Biden while 57% voted for Trump; and 42% of “Other” voted for Biden while 55% voted for Trump. When divided by age, 54% of 18-29 year olds voted for Biden, while 43% voted for Trump; 51% of 30-44 year olds voted for Biden, while 47% voted for Trump; 44% of 45-64 year olds voted for Biden while 54% voted for Trump; and 49% of “65 and over” voted for Biden while 50% voted for Trump. When divided by income, 46% of those who made under $50,000 voted for Biden while 52% voted for Trump; 46% of those who earned between $50,000 and $100,000 voted for Biden and 52% voted for Trump; and 51% of those making more than $100,000 voted for Biden and 47% voted for Trump. When divided by political philosophy, 91% of liberals voted for Biden and 7% voted for Trump. 58% of moderates voted for Biden and 40% voted for Trump. 9% of conservatives voted for Biden and 90% voted for Trump. When divided by party, 95% of Democrats voted for Biden, and 4% of Democrats voted for Trump. 5% of Republicans voted for Biden and 94% of Republicans voted for Trump. 49% of Independents voted for Biden and 46% voted for Trump.

Similar demographic effects were seen in the 2016 presidential election. For instance, 54 percent of women voted for the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, and 52 percent of men voted for the Republican candidate, Donald Trump. If considering age and race, Trump garnered percentages similar to Mitt Romney in these categories as well. And, as in 2020, households with incomes below $50,000 favored the Democratic candidate, while those households with incomes above $100,000 favored the Republican.50
类似的人口统计效应在 2016 年总统选举中也出现了。例如，54%的女性投票支持民主党候选人希拉里·克林顿，而 52%的男性投票支持共和党候选人唐纳德·特朗普。如果考虑年龄和种族因素，特朗普在这些类别中的得票率也与米特·罗姆尼相近。而且，与 2020 年一样，年收入低于 5 万美元的家庭倾向于支持民主党候选人，而年收入高于 10 万美元的家庭则倾向于支持共和党候选人。

The political culture of a state can also have an effect on ideology and opinion. In the 1960s, Daniel Elazar researched interviews, voting data, newspapers, and politicians’ speeches. He determined that states had unique cultures and that different state governments instilled different attitudes and beliefs in their citizens, creating political cultures. Some states value tradition, and their laws try to maintain longstanding beliefs. Other states believe government should help people and therefore create large bureaucracies that provide benefits to assist citizens. Some political cultures stress citizen involvement whereas others try to exclude participation by the masses.

[.my2]
一个国家的政治文化也会影响其意识形态和舆论。20 世纪 60 年代，丹尼尔·埃拉扎尔（Daniel Elazar）通过研究访谈、投票数据、报纸和政治家的演讲，发现各州拥有独特的文化，不同的州政府会向其公民灌输不同的态度和信仰，从而形成不同的政治文化 。 一些州重视传统，其法律力求维护长期存在的信仰。另一些州则认为政府应该服务于民，因此建立了庞大的官僚机构，为公民提供各种福利。有些政治文化强调公民参与，而另一些则试图排除民众的参与。

State political cultures can affect the ideology and opinions of those who live in or move to them. For example, opinions about gun ownership and rights vary from state to state. Polls show that 61 percent of all Californians, regardless of ideology or political party, stated there should be more controls on who owns guns.51 In contrast, in Texas, support for the right to carry a weapon is high. Fifty percent of self-identified Democrats—who typically prefer more controls on guns rather than fewer—said Texans should be allowed to carry a concealed weapon if they have a permit.52 In this case, state culture may have affected citizens’ feelings about the Second Amendment and moved them away from the expected ideological beliefs.

[.my2]
各州的政治文化会影响居住或迁入该州居民的意识形态和观点。例如，各州对枪支拥有权和相关权利的看法就存在差异。民调显示，61%的加州居民，无论其意识形态或政治立场如何，都认为应该加强对枪支拥有者的管控。 51 与之相反，在德克萨斯州，民众对持枪权的支持率很高。50%的自称民主党人——他们通常倾向于加强而非放松枪支管控——表示，如果持有许可证，德克萨斯州居民应该被允许隐蔽携带武器。 52 在这种情况下，州文化可能影响了公民对宪法第二修正案的看法，并使他们偏离了预期的意识形态信念。

The workplace can directly or indirectly affect opinions about policies, social issues, and political leaders by socializing employees through shared experiences. People who work in education, for example, are often surrounded by others with high levels of education. Their concerns will be specific to the education sector and different from those in other workplaces. Frequent association with colleagues can align a person’s thinking with theirs.

[.my2]
工作场所可以通过员工的共同经历，使他们彼此熟悉，从而直接或间接地影响他们对政策、社会问题和政治领导人的看法。例如，教育工作者通常身处高学历人群之中，他们的关注点往往与教育领域相关，与其他工作场所的关注点有所不同。与同事频繁接触有助于个人思维与他人保持一致。

Workplace groups such as professional organizations or unions can also influence opinions. These organizations provide members with specific information about issues important to them and lobby on their behalf in an effort to better work environments, increase pay, or enhance shared governance. They may also pressure members to vote for particular candidates or initiatives they believe will help promote the organization’s goals. For example, teachers’ unions often support the Democratic Party because it has historically supported increased funding to public schools and universities.

[.my2]
职场团体，例如专业组织或工会，也能影响舆论。这些组织会向成员提供与其息息相关的具体信息，并代表成员进行游说，以改善工作环境、提高薪酬或加强共同治理。他们也可能向成员施压，要求其投票支持他们认为有助于实现组织目标的特定候选人或提案。例如，教师工会通常支持民主党，因为民主党历来支持增加对公立中小学和大学的拨款。

Important political opinion leaders, or political elites, also shape public opinion, usually by serving as short-term cues that help voters pay closer attention to a political debate and make decisions about it. Through a talk program or opinion column, the elite commentator tells people when and how to react to a current problem or issue. Millennials and members of Generation X (born between 1965 and 1980) long used Jon Stewart of The Daily Show and later Stephen Colbert of The Colbert Report as shortcuts to becoming informed about current events. In the same way, older generations trusted Tom Brokaw and 60 Minutes. Today, most Americans, especially younger Americans, derive their news from their social media networks rather than from regularly watching a TV program.

[.my2]
重要的政治意见领袖，或称政治精英 ， 也会影响公众舆论，他们通常通过提供短期线索，帮助选民更加关注政治辩论并做出相关决策。通过谈话节目或专栏文章，这些精英评论员会告诉人们何时以及如何应对当前的问题或议题。千禧一代和 X 世代（1965 年至 1980 年出生）长期以来都将 《每日秀 》的乔恩·斯图尔特和后来的 《科尔伯特报告》 的斯蒂芬·科尔伯特视为了解时事的捷径。同样，老一辈人也信赖汤姆·布罗考和 《60 分钟》 节目。如今，大多数美国人，尤其是年轻的美国人，更多地从社交媒体网络获取新闻，而不是定期观看电视节目。

Because an elite source can pick and choose the information and advice to provide, the door is open to covert influence if this source is not credible or honest. Voters must be able to trust the quality of the information. When elites lose credibility, they lose their audience. News agencies are aware of the relationship between citizens and elites, which is why news anchors for major networks are carefully chosen. When Brian Williams of NBC was accused of lying about his experiences in Iraq and New Orleans, he was suspended pending an investigation. Williams later admitted to several misstatements and apologized to the public, and he was removed from The Nightly News.53
由于精英阶层可以自行选择提供的信息和建议，如果该信息来源不可信或不诚实，就容易受到隐蔽的影响。选民必须能够信任信息的质量。当精英阶层失去信誉时，他们就会失去受众。新闻机构深知公民与精英阶层之间的关系，因此各大电视网的新闻主播都经过精心挑选。当 NBC 的布莱恩 ·威廉姆斯被指控谎报其在伊拉克和新奥尔良的经历时，他被停职接受调查。威廉姆斯后来承认了多项不实陈述，并向公众道歉，随后被 《 晚间新闻》 节目解雇 。53

OPINIONS ABOUT POLITICS AND POLICIES
关于政治和政策的观点
What do Americans think about their political system, policies, and institutions? Public opinion has not been consistent over the years. It fluctuates based on the times and events, and on the people holding major office (Figure 6.13). Sometimes a majority of the public express similar ideas, but many times not. Where, then, does the public agree and disagree? Let’s look at the two-party system, and then at opinions about public policy, economic policy, and social policy.

[.my2]
美国民众如何看待他们的政治体制、政策和机构？多年来，公众舆论并不稳定，它会随着时代、事件以及担任要职的人员而波动（ 图 6.13 ）。有时，大多数公众表达的观点相似，但很多时候并非如此。那么，公众的共识和分歧究竟在哪里呢？让我们先来看看两党制，然后再看看公众对公共政策、经济政策和社会政策的看法。

The first chart shows the views on same sex marriage between 2001 and 2019. The line for those who oppose same sex marriage starts around 57% in 2001, slowly rising to 60% in 2004. It dips sharply until 2005 when it hits 53%. It rises again until it reaches 55% in 2006, then begins falling until 2008 when it hits 50%. It goes back up to 54% in 2009, then descends until it hits 32% in 2017. In 2019 it ends at 31%. The line for those who favor same sex marriage starts out around 35% in 2001 and falls until it hits 30% in 2004. It rises until it hits 36% in 2005, then drops slightly in 2006 to 35%. It begins to rise and hits 39% in 2008. It falls again in 2009, hitting 36%. It rises gradually from then on, until reaching 62% in 2017. In 2019 it ends at 61%. The second chart shows views on immigration from 1994 to 2019. The line representing those who think immigrants are a burden on our country starts at 63%.This line falls steadily until it hits 38% in 2000. It begins a slow rise until it hits 44% in 2003. It levels out until 2005, when it spikes up to 53% in 2006. It falls sharply down to 40% in 2007, and stays steady until 2009, when another sharp spike puts it back to 50% in 2010. After this spike, the line declines, leveling out at 35% in 2013 and 2014, until reaching 27% in 2016.  In 2017 the line has decreased to 26% and it ends in 2019 at 28%. The line representing those who think immigrants strengthen our country begins at 30%. It slowly rises, reaching a peak at 50% in 2000. It begins a slow decline until leveling out to 45% in 2004 and 2005. It falls to 40% in 2006, before rising again to 45% in 2009. It falls slightly to 44% in 2010, then begins to rise again until reaching 63% in 2016. At 2017 the line is at 65% and it ends in 2019 at 62%. At the bottom of the chart, sources are cited: Pew Research Center, “Changing Attitudes on Gay Marriage.” May 14, 2019. Pew Research Center. “Increasingly, Immigrants Seen as Strengthening America.” January 31, 2019.

图 6.13 公众舆论可能会随着时间发生显著变化。在过去二十年中，同性婚姻和移民这两个议题的公众舆论发生了巨大转变。
The United States is traditionally a two-party system. Only Democrats and Republicans regularly win the presidency and, with few exceptions, seats in Congress. The majority of voters cast ballots only for Republicans and Democrats, even when third parties are represented on the ballot. Yet, citizens say they are frustrated with the current party system. Only 33 percent identify themselves as Democrats and only 29 percent as Republicans while 34 percent identify themselves as independent. Democratic membership has stayed relatively the same, but the Republican Party has lost about 5 percent of its membership over the last ten years, whereas the number of self-identified independents has grown from 30 percent in 2004 to 34 percent in 2020.54 Given these numbers, it is not surprising that 58 percent of Americans say a third party is needed in U.S. politics today.55
美国传统上实行两党制 。只有民主党和共和党经常赢得总统职位，而且除少数例外情况外，国会席位也通常由这两个政党占据。大多数选民只投票给共和党和民主党，即使选票上有第三党候选人。然而，民众表示他们对目前的政党制度感到失望。只有 33%的人自认为是民主党人，只有 29%的人自认为是共和党人，而 34%的人自认为是独立人士。民主党的党员人数基本保持不变，但共和党在过去十年中流失了约 5%的党员，而自认为是独立人士的人数则从 2004 年的 30%增长到 2020 年的 34%。 54 鉴于这些数据，58%的美国人认为当今美国政治需要第三党也就不足为奇了。 55

Some of these changes in party allegiance may be due to generational and cultural shifts. Millennials and Generation Xers are more likely to support the Democratic Party than the Republican Party. In a 2015 poll, 51 percent of Millennials and 49 percent of Generation Xers stated they did, whereas only 35 percent and 38 percent, respectively, supported the Republican Party. Baby Boomers (born between 1946 and 1964) are slightly less likely than the other groups to support the Democratic Party; only 47 percent reported doing so. The Silent Generation (born in the 1920s to early 1940s) is the only cohort whose members state they support the Republican Party as a majority.56
政党忠诚度的这些变化可能部分源于代际和文化变迁。千禧一代和 X 世代更倾向于支持民主党而非共和党。在 2015 年的一项民意调查中，51%的千禧一代和 49%的 X 世代表示支持民主党，而支持共和党的分别只有 35%和 38%。婴儿潮一代（1946 年至 1964 年出生）支持民主党的可能性略低于其他群体，只有 47%的人表示支持民主党。沉默一代 （20 世纪 20 年代至 40 年代初出生）是唯一一个大多数成员表示支持共和党的群体。

Another shift in politics may be coming from the increasing number of multiracial citizens with strong cultural roots. Almost 7 percent of the population now identifies as biracial or multiracial, and that percentage is likely to grow. The number of citizens identifying as both African American and White doubled between 2000 and 2010, whereas the number of citizens identifying as both Asian American and White grew by 87 percent. The Pew study found that only 37 percent of multiracial adults favored the Republican Party, while 57 percent favored the Democratic Party.57 And, in the 2020 presidential election, the Democratic Party placed Kamala Harris, who is of African American and Indian descent, on the Democratic ticket, producing the country's first multiracial woman vice president. As the demographic composition of the United States changes and new generations become part of the voting population, public concerns and expectations will change as well.

[.my2]
政治格局的另一项转变可能源于拥有深厚文化根基的多种族公民数量的增长。目前，近 7%的人口自认为是混血或多种族人士，而且这一比例很可能还会增长。2000 年至 2010 年间，同时拥有非裔和白人血统的公民人数翻了一番，而同时拥有亚裔和白人血统的公民人数则增长了 87%。皮尤研究中心的一项研究发现，只有 37%的多种族成年人支持共和党，而 57 %支持民主党。在 2020 年总统大选中，民主党提名了拥有非裔和印度血统的卡马拉·哈里斯作为民主党候选人，她也因此成为美国历史上首位多种族女性副总统。随着美国人口结构的变化以及新一代选民的加入，公众的关注点和期望也将随之改变。

At its heart, politics is about dividing scarce resources fairly and balancing liberties and rights. Public policy often becomes messy as politicians struggle to fix problems with the nation’s limited budget while catering to numerous opinions about how best to do so. While the public often remains quiet, simply answering public opinion polls or dutifully casting their votes on Election Day, occasionally citizens weigh in more audibly by protesting or lobbying.

[.my2]
政治的本质在于公平分配稀缺资源，平衡自由与权利。公共政策往往因政治家们在国家预算有限的情况下努力解决问题，同时还要兼顾各方意见而变得混乱不堪。虽然公众通常保持沉默，只是简单地参与民意调查或在选举日按时投票，但有时公民也会通过抗议或游说等方式发出更响亮的声音。

Some policy decisions are made without public input if they preserve the way money is allocated or defer to policies already in place. But policies that directly affect personal economics, such as tax policy, may cause a public backlash, and those that affect civil liberties or closely held beliefs may cause even more public upheaval. Policies that break new ground similarly stir public opinion and introduce change that some find difficult. The acceptance of same-sex marriage, for example, pitted those who sought to preserve their religious beliefs against those who sought to be treated equally under the law.

[.my2]
如果某些政策决定维持现有的资金分配方式或遵循既有政策，则无需征求公众意见。但直接影响个人经济的政策，例如税收政策，可能会引发公众强烈反对；而那些影响公民自由或个人信仰的政策，则可能造成更大的社会动荡。同样，开创性的政策也会激起公众舆论，并带来一些人难以接受的变革。例如，同性婚姻合法化就引发了两派的争论：一派是寻求维护自身宗教信仰的人，另一派则是寻求法律面前人人平等的人。

Where does the public stand on economic policy? Only 27 percent of citizens surveyed in 2021 thought the U.S. economy was in excellent or good condition,58 yet 53 percent believed their personal financial situation was excellent to good.59 While this seems inconsistent, it reflects the fact that we notice what is happening outside our own home. Even if a family’s personal finances are stable, members will be aware of friends and relatives who are suffering job losses or foreclosures. This information will give them a broader, more negative view of the economy beyond their own pocketbook.

[.my2]
公众对经济政策持何种立场？2021 年的一项调查显示，仅有 27%的受访公民认为美国经济状况良好或优秀 58 ，但 53%的人认为自己的个人财务状况良好或优秀 59 。尽管这看似矛盾，但它反映了我们往往会关注自身生活之外发生的事情。即使一个家庭的个人财务状况稳定，家庭成员也会注意到亲朋好友正在遭受失业或房屋止赎的困境。这些信息会让他们对经济状况形成更全面、更负面的看法，而不仅仅局限于自身的经济状况。

Compared to strong public support for fiscal responsibility and government spending cuts a decade ago, in 2019, when asked about government spending or cuts across thirteen budget areas, there was little public support for cuts of any kind.60 In fact, there was support for spending increases in all thirteen areas. Education and veterans benefits were the areas with the most popular support, with 72 percent of respondents supporting increased spending in these categories, and only 9 percent of respondents supporting cuts to education and 4 percent of respondents supporting cuts to veterans benefits. Even in areas where more Americans wanted to see cuts, such as assistance to the unemployed (23 percent of respondents favored decreasing spending), there was a larger group (31 percent) that favored increased spending and still another and even larger group (43 percent) wanting current spending maintained.61 A 2020 Pew survey demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic has further lessened the public’s concern with growing budget deficits.62
与十年前公众对财政责任和削减政府开支的强烈支持相比，2019 年，当被问及 13 个预算领域的政府支出或削减时，公众对任何形式的削减都鲜有支持。 60 事实上，所有 13 个领域的支出增加都得到了支持。教育和退伍军人福利是支持率最高的领域，72%的受访者支持增加这些领域的支出，只有 9%的受访者支持削减教育支出，4%的受访者支持削减退伍军人福利。即使在更多美国人希望削减的领域，例如失业救济金（23%的受访者赞成减少支出），也有更大比例的人（31%）赞成增加支出，还有更大比例的人（43%）希望维持目前的支出水平。 61 2020 年皮尤研究中心的一项调查显示，新冠疫情进一步降低了公众对预算赤字不断增长的担忧。 62

Social policy consists of government’s attempts to regulate public behavior in the service of a better society. To accomplish this, government must achieve the difficult task of balancing the rights and liberties of citizens. A person’s right to privacy, for example, might need to be limited if another person is in danger. But to what extent should the government intrude in the private lives of its citizens? In a recent survey, 54 percent of respondents believed the U.S. government was too involved in trying to deal with issues of morality.63
社会政策是指政府为了构建更美好的社会而试图规范公众行为。为了实现这一目标，政府必须应对平衡公民权利和自由这一艰巨任务。例如，如果他人身处险境，个人的隐私权可能需要受到限制。但是，政府应该在多大程度上干预公民的私生活呢？在最近的一项调查中，54%的受访者认为美国政府过度干预了道德问题。 63

Abortion is a social policy issue that has caused controversy for nearly a century. One segment of the population wants to protect the rights of the unborn child. Another wants to protect the bodily autonomy of women and the right to privacy between a patient and her doctor. The divide is visible in public opinion polls, where 59 percent of respondents said abortion should be legal in most cases and 39 percent said it should be illegal in most cases.64 The Affordable Care Act, which increased government involvement in health care, has drawn similar controversy. In a 2017 poll, 56 percent of respondents approved of the ACA (up 20 percent since 2013), while 38 percent expressed disapproval of the act.65 Today, the ACA is more popular than ever. Reasons for its popularity include the fact that more Americans have health insurance, pre-existing conditions cannot be a factor in the denial of coverage, and health insurance is more affordable for many people. Much of the public’s initial frustration with the ACA came from the act’s mandate that individuals purchase health insurance or pay a fine (in order to create a large enough pool of insured people to reduce the overall cost of coverage), which some saw as an intrusion into individual decision making. The individual mandate penalty was reduced to $0 after the end of 2018.

堕胎是一个近百年来一直备受争议的社会政策议题。一部分人希望保护未出生胎儿的权利，而另一部分人则希望保护女性的身体自主权以及患者与医生之间的隐私权。民意调查结果清晰地反映了这种分歧：59%的受访者认为堕胎在大多数情况下应该合法，而 39%的受访者则认为堕胎在大多数情况下应该非法。 64 《 平价医疗法案》（ACA ）扩大了政府对医疗保健的干预，也引发了类似的争议。在 2017 年的一项民意调查中，56%的受访者支持 ACA（比 2013 年上升了 20%），而 38%的受访者表示反对。 65 如今，ACA 比以往任何时候都更受欢迎。其受欢迎的原因包括：更多美国人拥有了医疗保险，既往病史不再是拒绝承保的理由，以及医疗保险对许多人来说更加经济实惠。公众最初对《平价医疗法案》（ACA）的诸多不满，很大程度上源于该法案强制个人购买医疗保险或缴纳罚款（目的是为了扩大参保人群规模，从而降低整体医疗成本），一些人认为这是对个人决策的干涉。2018 年底之后，强制参保罚款降至 0 美元。

Laws allowing same-sex marriage raise the question whether the government should be defining marriage and regulating private relationships in defense of personal and spousal rights. Public opinion has shifted dramatically over the last twenty years. In 1996, only 27 percent of Americans felt same-sex marriage should be legal, but recent polls show support has increased to 70 percent.66 Despite this sharp increase, a number of states had banned same-sex marriage until the Supreme Court decided, in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), that states were obliged to give marriage licenses to couples of the same sex and to recognize out-of-state, same-sex marriages.67 Some churches and businesses continue to argue that no one should be compelled by the government to recognize or support a marriage between members of the same sex if it conflicts with their religious beliefs.68 Undoubtedly, the issue will continue to cause a divide in public opinion.

允许同性婚姻的法律引发了一个问题：政府是否应该为了维护个人和配偶的权利而定义婚姻并监管私人关系？过去二十年来，公众舆论发生了巨大转变。1996 年，只有 27%的美国人认为同性婚姻应该合法，但最近的民意调查显示，支持率已上升至 70%。 66 尽管支持率大幅上升，但在最高法院于 2015 年 “奥贝格费尔诉霍奇斯案”（Obergefell v. Hodges ）中裁定各州有义务向同性伴侣颁发结婚证并承认外州同性婚姻之前，许多州仍然禁止同性婚姻。 67 一些教会和企业仍然认为，如果同性婚姻与宗教信仰相冲突，政府不应强迫任何人承认或支持同性婚姻。 68 毫无疑问，这个问题将继续在公众舆论中引发分歧。

Another area where social policy must balance rights and liberties is public safety. Regulation of gun ownership incites strong emotions, because it invokes the Second Amendment and state culture. Of those polled nationwide, when asked whether the government should prioritize reducing gun violence or protecting the right to bear arms, 50 percent of Americans favored reducing gun violence, while 43 percent favored emphasizing gun rights.69 Fifty-three percent feel there should be stronger controls over gun ownership.70 These numbers change from state to state, however, because of political culture. Immigration similarly causes strife, with citizens fearing increases in crime and social spending due to large numbers of people entering the United States illegally. Yet, 69 percent of respondents did believe there should be a path to citizenship for non-documented residents already in the country.71 And while the national government’s drug policy still lists marijuana as an illegal substance, 68 percent of respondents stated they would agree if the government legalized marijuana.72
社会政策必须平衡权利与自由的另一个领域是公共安全。枪支管制会引发强烈的情绪，因为它涉及到宪法第二修正案和国家文化。在全国范围内进行的民意调查中，当被问及政府应该优先减少枪支暴力还是保护持枪权时，50%的美国人赞成减少枪支暴力，而 43%的人赞成强调持枪权。 69 53%的人认为应该加强对枪支所有权的管制。 70 然而，由于政治文化的差异，这些数据因州而异。移民问题同样会引发争议，公民担心大量非法移民涌入美国会导致犯罪率上升和社会支出增加。然而，69%的受访者认为应该为已在美国的无证居民提供入籍途径。 71 虽然联邦政府的毒品政策仍然将大麻列为非法物质，但 68%的受访者表示，如果政府将大麻合法化，他们会表示赞同。 72

The COVID-19 pandemic presented a rich set of data on public opinion and significant dynamics in opinion over time. Early on, Americans across the spectrum expressed similar concerns about the outbreak and the path forward. However, within a few months, a partisan divide emerged on how widespread the disease was and what measures should be in place to control it. Democratic respondents saw the disease as more widespread and in need of strong government controls, while Republicans raised concerns about scientific data, the propensity of testing, and too much control by the government.73
新冠疫情提供了大量关于公众舆论及其随时间推移而发生的显著变化的数据。疫情初期，美国各界人士对疫情爆发和未来走向都表达了类似的担忧。然而，短短几个月内，关于疫情的传播范围以及应采取哪些控制措施，就出现了党派分歧。民主党受访者认为疫情传播范围更广，需要政府采取强有力的管控措施，而共和党人则对科学数据、检测能力以及政府过度干预表示担忧 。73

PUBLIC OPINION AND POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS
公众舆论与政治制度
Public opinion about American institutions is measured in public approval ratings rather than in questions of choice between positions or candidates. The congressional and executive branches of government are the subject of much scrutiny and discussed daily in the media. Polling companies take daily approval polls of these two branches. The Supreme Court makes the news less frequently, and approval polls are more likely after the court has released major opinions. All three branches, however, are susceptible to swings in public approval in response to their actions and to national events. Approval ratings are generally not stable for any of the three. We next look at each in turn.

[.my2]
公众对美国政府机构的看法并非基于对不同立场或候选人的选择，而是通过公众支持率来衡量。国会和行政部门备受关注，媒体每天都会对此进行报道。民调机构每天都会对这两个部门进行支持率调查。最高法院的新闻曝光率较低，通常在最高法院发布重要判决后才会进行支持率调查。然而，这三个部门的支持率都会受到其自身行为和国家大事的影响而出现波动。一般来说，这三个部门的支持率都不稳定。接下来，我们将逐一分析。

The president is the most visible member of the U.S. government and a lightning rod for disagreement. Presidents are often blamed for the decisions of their administrations and political parties, and are held accountable for economic and foreign policy downturns. For these reasons, they can expect their approval ratings to slowly decline over time, increasing or decreasing slightly with specific events. On average, presidents enjoy a 66 percent approval rating when starting office, but it drops to 53 percent by the end of the first term. Presidents serving a second term average a beginning approval rating of 55.5 percent, which falls to 47 percent by the end of office. For most of his term, President Obama’s presidency followed the same trend. He entered office with a public approval rating of 67 percent, which fell to 54 percent by the third quarter, dropped to 52 percent after his reelection, and, as of October 2015, was at 46 percent. However, after January 2016, his approval rating began to climb, and he left office with an approval rating of 59 percent (Figure 6.14). President Trump experienced significantly lower approval ratings than average, taking the oath of office with an approval rating of 45 percent and leaving office in January 2021 at 34 percent. Moreover, throughout his presidency, Trump's approval rate never rose above 49 percent. President Biden's approval was at 54 percent as of March 2021.74
总统是美国政府中最受瞩目的成员，也是争议的焦点。总统常常因其政府和政党的决策而受到指责，并需为经济和外交政策的下滑承担责任。因此，他们的支持率通常会随着时间的推移而缓慢下降，并会因特定事件而略有波动。平均而言，总统在就职之初的支持率为 66%，但到第一任期结束时会降至 53%。连任总统的平均支持率为 55.5%，到任期结束时会降至 47%。奥巴马总统在其任期的大部分时间里都遵循着同样的趋势。他上任之初的支持率为 67%，到第三季度降至 54%，连任后降至 52%，截至 2015 年 10 月，支持率仅为 46%。然而，自 2016 年 1 月起，他的支持率开始攀升，卸任时支持率达到 59%（ 图 6.14 ）。特朗普总统的支持率远低于平均水平，就职时支持率为 45%，2021 年 1 月卸任时为 34%。此外，在其整个总统任期内，特朗普的支持率从未超过 49%。截至 2021 年 3 月，拜登总统的支持率为 54 %。

Chart shows President Obama’s job approval ratings from 2009 to 2017. When his Presidency begins on January 2009, he is at around 65%. When the Affordable Care Act is passed in March 2010, his approval rating dropped to around 50%. When Osama bin Laden was killed, his approval ratings went up slightly to around 54%. After falling to around 40%, his approval rating begins to rise, until his reelection on November 2012 when it was at around 53%. It rises slightly, peaking around 56%, then slowly declining. When the budget crises hits in October 2013, Obama’s approval rating is around 45%, hitting a low of about 40% around 2014. It then continues to gradually rise ending with a final approval in January 2018 of 55%. At the bottom of the chart, a source is cited: “Gallup. “President Approval Ratings, Barack Obama.” January 2019.”
Figure 6.14 As President Obama’s ratings demonstrate, presidential approval ratings generally decline over time but may fluctuate based on specific events or policies.

[.my2]
图 6.14 正如奥巴马总统的支持率所表明的那样，总统的支持率通常会随着时间的推移而下降，但可能会根据具体事件或政策而波动。
Events during a president’s term may spike public approval ratings. George W. Bush’s public approval rating jumped from 51 percent on September 10, 2001, to 86 percent by September 15 following the 9/11 attacks. His father, George H. W. Bush, had received a similar spike in approval ratings (from 58 to 89 percent) following the end of the first Persian Gulf War in 1991.75 These spikes rarely last more than a few weeks, so presidents try to quickly use the political capital they bring. For example, the 9/11 rally effect helped speed a congressional joint resolution authorizing the president to use troops, and the “global war on terror” became a reality.76 The rally was short-lived, and support for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan quickly deteriorated post-2003.77
总统任期内的某些事件可能会使公众支持率飙升。例如，在 9·11 事件发生后，乔治·W· 布什的公众支持率从 2001 年 9 月 10 日的 51%跃升至 9 月 15 日的 86%。他的父亲乔治·H·W· 布什在 1991 年第一次海湾战争结束后也曾出现过类似的支持率飙升（从 58%升至 89%）。 75 这些支持率的飙升通常持续几周，因此总统们会试图迅速利用由此带来的政治资本。例如，9·11 事件带来的支持率提升加速了国会授权总统动用军队的联合决议的通过，“全球反恐战争”由此成为现实。 76 然而，这种支持率的提升是短暂的，2003 年后，公众对伊拉克和阿富汗战争的支持迅速下降。 77

Some presidents have had higher or lower public approval than others, though ratings are difficult to compare, because national and world events that affect presidential ratings are outside a president’s control. Several chief executives presided over failing economies or wars, whereas others had the benefit of strong economies and peace. Gallup, however, gives an average approval rating for each president across the entire period served in office. George W. Bush’s average approval rating from 2001 to 2008 was 49.4 percent. Ronald Reagan’s from 1981 to 1988 was 52.8 percent, despite his winning all but thirteen electoral votes in his reelection bid. Bill Clinton’s average approval from 1993 to 2000 was 55.1 percent, including the months surrounding the Monica Lewinsky scandal and his subsequent impeachment. To compare other notable presidents, John F. Kennedy averaged 70.1 percent and Richard Nixon 49 percent.78 Kennedy’s average was unusually high because his time in office was short; he was assassinated before he could run for reelection, leaving less time for his ratings to decline. Nixon’s unusually low approval ratings reflect several months of media and congressional investigations into his involvement in the Watergate affair, as well as his resignation in the face of likely impeachment.

一些总统的公众支持率高于或低于其他总统，但由于影响总统支持率的国内和国际事件并非总统所能控制，因此很难进行比较。一些总统执政期间经济衰退或战乱频仍，而另一些总统则受益于强劲的经济和和平。不过，盖洛普民意调查公司给出了每位总统在其整个任期内的平均支持率。乔治·W·布什在 2001 年至 2008 年期间的平均支持率为 49.4%。罗纳德· 里根在 1981 年至 1988 年期间的平均支持率为 52.8%，尽管他在连任竞选中仅以 13 票之差落败。比尔· 克林顿在 1993 年至 2000 年期间的平均支持率为 55.1%，其中包括莫妮卡·莱温斯基丑闻及其随后的弹劾事件发生前后的几个月。与其他著名总统相比，约翰·F· 肯尼迪的平均支持率为 70.1%，理查德 ·尼克松的平均支持率为 49%。 肯尼迪的平均支持率异常高，因为他的任期很短；他在竞选连任之前就遇刺身亡，因此支持率下降的时间也更短。尼克松异常低的支持率则反映了媒体和国会几个月来对他参与水门事件的调查，以及他因可能面临弹劾而辞职。

Public Mood and Watershed Moments
公众情绪与转折点
Polling is one area of U.S. politics in which political practitioners and political science scholars interact. Each election cycle, political scientists help media outlets interpret polling, statistical data, and election forecasts. One particular watershed moment in this regard occurred when Professor James Stimson, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, developed his aggregated measure of public mood. This measure takes a variety of issue positions and combines them to form a general ideology about the government. According to Professor Stimson, the American electorate became more conservative in the 1970s and again in the 1990s, as demonstrated by Republican gains in Congress. With this public mood measure in mind, political scientists can explain why and when Americans allowed major policy shifts. For example, the Great Society’s expansion of welfare and social benefits occurred during the height of liberalism in the mid-1960s, while the welfare cuts and reforms of the 1990s occurred during the nation’s move toward conservatism. Tracking conservative and liberal shifts in the public’s ideology allows policy analysts to predict whether voters are likely to accept or reject major policies.

民意调查是美国政治实践者和政治学者互动的重要领域之一。每逢选举周期，政治学家都会帮助媒体解读民调、统计数据和选举预测。在这方面，一个具有里程碑意义的时刻是北卡罗来纳大学教堂山分校的詹姆斯·史汀生教授开发出综合民意指标。该指标综合考虑了各种议题立场，并将它们结合起来，形成对政府的总体意识形态。史汀生教授指出，正如共和党在国会席位的增加所表明的那样，美国选民在20世纪70年代和90年代变得更加保守。有了这一民意指标，政治学家就能解释美国人为何以及何时接受了重大的政策转变。例如，“伟大社会”计划扩大了福利和社会保障，而这一计划正值20世纪60年代中期自由主义盛行时期；而20世纪90年代的福利削减和改革则发生在美国转向保守主义的时期。追踪公众意识形态中保守派和自由派的转变，可以让政策分析人士预测选民是否可能接受或拒绝重大政策。

What other means of measuring the public mood do you think might be effective and reliable? How would you implement them? Do you agree that watershed moments in history signal public mood changes? If so, give some examples. If not, why not?
您认为还有哪些其他方法可以有效可靠地衡量公众情绪？您会如何实施这些方法？您是否同意历史上的转折点预示着公众情绪的变化？如果同意，请举例说明。如果不同意，为什么？

Congress as an institution has historically received lower approval ratings than presidents, a striking result because individual senators and representatives are generally viewed favorably by their constituents. While congressional representatives almost always win reelection and are liked by their constituents back home, the institution itself is often vilified as representing everything that is wrong with politics and partisanship.

[.my2]
国会作为一个机构，其支持率历来低于总统，这一结果令人震惊，因为参议员和众议员个人通常都受到选民的欢迎。尽管国会议员几乎总能连任，并且深受选民爱戴，但国会这一机构本身却常常被诟病，被认为是政治和党派之争中一切弊端的化身。

As of March 2021 public approval of Congress sat at around 34 percent.79 For most of the last forty years, congressional approval levels have bounced between 20 percent and 60 percent, but in the last fifteen years they have regularly fallen below 40 percent. Like President George W. Bush, Congress experienced a short-term jump in approval ratings immediately following 9/11, likely because of the rallying effect of the terrorist attacks. Congressional approval had dropped back below 50 percent by early 2003 (Figure 6.15).

[.my2]
截至 2021 年 3 月，公众对国会的支持率约为 34%。 79 在过去四十年的大部分时间里，国会的支持率在 20%到 60%之间波动，但在过去十五年中，其支持率经常低于 40%。与乔治·W·布什总统一样，国会的支持率在 9·11 事件后也经历了短期上升，这很可能是由于恐怖袭击的鼓舞作用。到 2003 年初，国会的支持率已回落至 50%以下（ 图 6.15 ）。

Chart shows congressional job approval ratings from 1974 to 2024. Starting around 30% in 1974, it rises slightly to 32% in 1975 before dipping to 25% in 1976. After the dip, it spikes again to35% in 1977, before falling again to 20% in 1979. It rises to 38% in 1981, then falls again in 1982 to 30 %. There is a slow increase to 41% in 1986, where it levels out until 1988, when it begins to drop until it reaches 30% in 1990. It rebounds slightly to 31% in 1991, but falls drastically to 20% in 1992. A sharp increase in 1993 to 25% leads to a steady increase of approval ratings until 200 when it reaches 50%. A drastic spike in 2001 shoots approval ratings up to 82%, and a sharp decline lands approval ratings back at 50% by 2003. It levels off for a year, before falling again to 28% in 2006. A small spike in 2007puts it at 35%, before it falls down to 20% in 2009. There is another small increase to 24% in 2010, then another decrease to 10% in 2013. The chart shows an approval rating at 15% in 2015. In 2016 there are a series of ups and downs with a slight overall increase to around 18-19% by the end of 2016. In 2017, there is a spike to 28% in February, which evens out to around 20% until mid-2017, and dips in November 2017 to around 13%. In 2019, the range of approval varies from the mid-20%s in the early and late parts of the year with a dip to 17% midyear. 2020 sees a marked spike to 30-31% in April and May, dropping back to the high teens late in the year, and starting to climb again in 2021 with rates between 25 and 36% for the first half of 202, but then returning to about 16% in 2022 and climbing toward 19-20% in 2024.

图 6.15 显示，过去四十年间，国会的支持率总体上在 20% 到 50% 之间波动；然而，在 2001 年 9 月 11 日恐怖袭击事件发生后，这一支持率飙升至 80% 以上。资料来源：盖洛普，“国会与公众，国会工作支持率”。检索日期：2025 年 2 月。
While presidents are affected by foreign and domestic events, congressional approval is mainly affected by domestic events. When the economy rebounds or gas prices drop, public approval of Congress tends to go up. But when party politics within Congress becomes a domestic event, public approval falls. The passage of revenue bills has become an example of such an event, because deficits require Congress to make policy decisions before changing the budget. Deficit and debt are not new to the United States. Congress and presidents have attempted various methods of controlling debt, sometimes successfully and sometimes not. In the past three decades alone, however, several prominent examples have shown how party politics make it difficult for Congress to agree on a budget without a fight, and how these fights affect public approval.

[.my2]
总统会受到国内外事件的影响，而国会的支持率主要受国内事件的影响。当经济复苏或油价下跌时，公众对国会的支持率往往会上升。但当国会内部的党派政治演变成国内事件时，公众支持率就会下降。通过财政拨款法案就是一个典型的例子，因为赤字需要国会在修改预算前做出政策决定。赤字和债务对美国来说并不陌生。国会和总统都尝试过各种控制债务的方法，有时成功，有时失败。然而，仅在过去三十年中，就有几个突出的例子表明，党派政治如何使国会难以在不发生争执的情况下就预算达成一致，以及这些争执如何影响公众支持率。

In 1995, Democratic president Bill Clinton and the Republican Congress hit a notable stalemate on the national budget. In this case, the Republicans had recently gained control of the House of Representatives and disagreed with Democrats and the president on how to cut spending and reduce the deficit. The government shut down twice, sending non-essential employees home for a few days in November, and then again in December and January.80 Congressional approval fell during the event, from 35 to 30 percent.81
1995 年，民主党总统比尔· 克林顿与共和党控制的国会在国家预算问题上陷入僵局。当时，共和党刚刚掌控众议院，与民主党和总统在如何削减开支和减少赤字的问题上存在分歧。政府因此两次停摆，11 月和 12 月、1 月分别让非必要岗位员工居家办公数日。在此期间， 国会对预算的支持率从 35%下降到 30 %。

Divisions between the political parties, inside the Republican Party, and between Congress and the president became more pronounced over the next fifteen years, with the media closely covering the political strife.82 In 2011, the United States reached its debt ceiling, or maximum allowed debt amount. After much debate, the Budget Control Act was passed by Congress and signed by President Obama. The act increased the debt ceiling, but it also reduced spending and created automatic cuts, called sequestrations, if further legislation did not deal with the debt by 2013. When the country reached its new debt ceiling of $16.4 trillion in 2013, short-term solutions led to Congress negotiating both the debt ceiling and the national budget at the same time. The timing raised the stakes of the budget, and Democrats and Republicans fought bitterly over the debt ceiling, budget cuts, and taxes. Inaction triggered the automatic cuts to the budget in areas like defense, the courts, and public aid. By October, approximately 800,000 federal employees had been sent home, and the government went into partial shut-down for sixteen days before Congress passed a bill to raise the debt ceiling.83 The handling of these events angered Americans, who felt the political parties needed to work together to solve problems rather than play political games. During the 2011 ceiling debate, congressional approval fell from 18 to 13 percent, while in 2013, congressional approval fell to a new low of 9 percent in November.84
在接下来的十五年里，各政党之间的分歧，包括共和党内部的分歧以及国会与总统之间的分歧日益加剧 ，媒体密切关注着这场政治斗争。2011 年，美国债务达到上限，即允许的最高债务额度。经过激烈的辩论，国会通过了 《预算控制法案》 ，并由奥巴马总统签署生效。该法案提高了债务上限，但也削减了开支，并规定如果到 2013 年仍未出台进一步的立法解决债务问题，则会自动削减开支，即所谓的“自动减支”。2013 年，当美国债务达到 16.4 万亿美元的新上限时，短期解决方案导致国会同时就债务上限和国家预算进行谈判。这一时间节点提高了预算问题的重要性，民主党和共和党就债务上限、预算削减和税收问题展开了激烈的争论。如果双方不采取行动，国防、法院和公共援助等领域的预算就会自动削减。到 10 月份，约有 80 万联邦雇员被遣散回家，政府部分停摆了 16 天，直到国会通过一项提高债务上限的法案。 83 这些事件的处理方式激怒了美国民众，他们认为各政党需要携手解决问题，而不是玩弄政治游戏。在 2011 年的债务上限辩论期间，国会的支持率从 18%下降到 13%，而在 2013 年 11 月，国会的支持率跌至 9%的新低。 84

The Supreme Court generally enjoys less visibility than the other two branches of government, which leads to more stable but also less frequent polling results. Indeed, 22 percent of citizens surveyed in 2014 had never heard of Chief Justice John Roberts, the head of the Supreme Court.85 The court is protected by the justices’ non-elected, non-political positions, which gives them the appearance of integrity and helps the Supreme Court earn higher public approval ratings than presidents and Congress. To compare, between 2000 and 2010, the court’s approval rating bounced between 50 and 60 percent. During this same period, Congress had a 20 to 40 percent approval rating.

[.my2]
最高法院的知名度通常低于政府其他两个部门，这使得其民调结果更为稳定，但也较少出现。事实上，2014 年的一项调查显示，22%的受访公民从未听说过最高法院首席大法官约翰· 罗伯茨 。 85 最高法院大法官的非选举产生、非政治性职位为其提供了保障，使其在公众眼中显得正直，并有助于最高法院获得比总统和国会更高的公众支持率。相比之下，2000 年至 2010 年间，最高法院的支持率在 50%至 60%之间波动。而同期，国会的支持率仅为 20%至 40%。

The Supreme Court’s approval rating is also less susceptible to the influence of events. Support of and opinions about the court are affected when the justices rule on highly visible cases that are of public interest or other events occur that cause citizens to become aware of the court.86 For example, following the Bush v. Gore case (2000), in which the court instructed Florida to stop recounting ballots and George W. Bush won the Electoral College, 80 percent of Republicans approved of the court, versus only 42 percent of Democrats.87 Twelve years later, when the Supreme Court’s ruling in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012) let stand the Affordable Care Act’s requirement of individual coverage, approval by Democrats increased to 68 percent, while Republican support dropped to 29 percent.88 In 2015, following the handing down of decisions in King v. Burwell (2015) and Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), which allowed the Affordable Care Act’s subsidies and prohibited states from denying same-sex marriage, respectively, 45 percent of people said they approved of the way the Supreme Court handled its job, down 4 percent from before the decisions.89
最高法院的支持率也较少受到事件的影响。只有当大法官们就备受瞩目的公共利益案件作出裁决，或发生其他事件使公民更加关注最高法院时，公众对最高法院的支持和看法才会受到影响。 86 例如，在布什诉戈尔案（2000 年）中，最高法院指示佛罗里达州停止重新计票，乔治·W·布什赢得了选举人团的胜利。此后，80%的共和党人对最高法院表示支持，而民主党人的支持率仅为 42%。 87 十二年后，最高法院在全国独立企业联合会诉塞贝柳斯案（2012 年）中维持了《平价医疗法案》中关于个人医保的要求，民主党人的支持率上升至 68%，而共和党人的支持率则下降至 29%。 88 2015 年，在金诉伯韦尔案（King v. Burwell ，2015）和奥贝格费尔诉霍奇斯案（Obergefell v. Hodges ，2015）分别作出裁决后，这两项裁决分别允许《 平价医疗法案 》的补贴生效，并禁止各州拒绝同性婚姻。此后，45%的人表示他们认可最高法院的处理方式，比裁决前下降了 4% 。89
