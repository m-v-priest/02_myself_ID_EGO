== 释义


In 1786, Virginia and Maryland invited delegates from the other eleven states to meet in Annapolis, Maryland, for the purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation. However, only five states sent representatives. Because all thirteen states had to agree to any alteration of the Articles, the convention in Annapolis could not accomplish its goal. Two of the delegates, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, requested that all states send delegates to a convention in Philadelphia the following year to attempt once again to revise the Articles of Confederation. All the states except Rhode Island chose delegates to send to the meeting, a total of seventy men in all, but many did not attend. Among those not in attendance were John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, both of whom were overseas representing the country as diplomats. Because the shortcomings of the Articles of Confederation proved impossible to overcome, the convention that met in Philadelphia in 1787 decided to create an entirely new government.

1786 年，弗吉尼亚州和马里兰州, 邀请其他十一个州的代表齐聚马里兰州安纳波利斯，商讨修订 《邦联条例》 。然而，只有五个州派出了代表。由于任何对《邦联条例》的修改, 都必须得到所有十三个州的同意，安纳波利斯会议未能达成目标。两位代表，亚历山大· 汉密尔顿和詹姆斯 ·麦迪逊 ，请求所有州都派代表参加次年在费城举行的会议，再次尝试修订《邦联条例》。除罗德岛州外，所有州都选派了代表参加会议，共计七十人，但许多人并未出席。约翰 ·亚当斯和托马斯· 杰斐逊也未能出席，他们当时都在海外担任外交官。由于《邦联条例》的缺陷无法克服，1787 年在费城召开的会议, 决定建立一个全新的政府。

=== POINTS OF CONTENTION

[.my2]
争议点


Fifty-five delegates arrived in Philadelphia in May 1787 for the meeting that became known as the Constitutional Convention. Many wanted to strengthen the role and authority of the national government but feared creating a central government that was too powerful. They wished to preserve state autonomy, although not to a degree that prevented the states from working together collectively or made them entirely independent of the will of the national government. While seeking to protect the rights of individuals from government abuse, they nevertheless wished to create a society in which concerns for law and order did not give way in the face of demands for individual liberty. They wished to give political rights to all free men but also feared mob rule, which many felt would have been the result of Shays’ Rebellion had it succeeded. Delegates from small states did not want their interests pushed aside by delegations from more populous states like Virginia. And everyone was concerned about slavery. Representatives from southern states worried that delegates from states where it had been or was being abolished might try to outlaw the institution. Those who favored a nation free of the influence of slavery feared that southerners might attempt to make it a permanent part of American society. The only decision that all could agree on was the election of George Washington, the former commander of the Continental Army and hero of the American Revolution, as the president of the convention.

[.my2]
1787 年 5 月，55 名代表抵达**费城，参加后来被称为"制宪会议"的会议。**许多代表希望加强联邦政府的作用和权威，但又担心中央政府权力过大。他们希望维护各州的自治权，但又不希望各州的自治程度过高，以至于无法共同合作，或完全脱离联邦政府的意志。在寻求保护个人权利免受政府滥用权力的同时，他们也希望建立一个在维护法律和秩序的同时，不因个人自由诉求而妥协的社会。他们希望赋予所有"自由人"政治权利，但也担心暴民统治，**许多人认为，如果"谢斯起义"成功，就会导致暴民统治。**来自小州的代表, 不希望他们的利益被来自弗吉尼亚等人口大州的代表所忽视。此外，"奴隶制问题"也令所有人担忧。南方各州的代表担心，那些已经或正在废除"奴隶制"的州的代表, 可能会试图取缔奴隶制。那些主张建立一个不受奴隶制影响的国家的人担心，南方人可能会试图让奴隶制成为美国社会永久的一部分。*唯一所有人都能达成一致的决定, 是选举乔治 ·华盛顿 ——这位曾任大陆军总司令、美国独立战争英雄——担任"制宪会议"主席。*

=== The Question of Representation: Small States vs. Large States

[.my2]
代表权问题：小州与大州

One of the first differences among the delegates to become clear was between those from large states, such as New York and Virginia, and those who represented small states, like Delaware. When discussing the structure of the government under the new constitution, the delegates from Virginia called for a bicameral legislature consisting of two houses. The number of a state’s representatives in each house was to be based on the state’s population. In each state, representatives in the lower house would be elected by popular vote. These representatives would then select their state’s representatives in the upper house from among candidates proposed by the state’s legislature. Once a representative’s term in the legislature had ended, the representative could not be reelected until an unspecified amount of time had passed.

[.my2]
代表们之间最先显现的分歧之一，是来自纽约州和弗吉尼亚州等大州的代表, 与来自特拉华州等小州的代表之间的分歧。在讨论"新宪法"下的"政府结构"时，弗吉尼亚州的代表们呼吁, 设立由两院组成的两院制立法机构 。各州在两院的代表人数, 将根据该州的人口数量确定。在每个州，"下议院"的代表将由"普选"产生。这些下议院代表, 随后将从州议会提名的候选人中, 选出本州在"上议院"的代表。一旦代表的任期结束，在一段未明确规定的时间内, 不得再次当选。

Delegates from small states objected to this Virginia Plan. Another proposal, the New Jersey Plan, called for a unicameral legislature with one house, in which each state would have one vote. Thus, smaller states would have the same power in the national legislature as larger states. However, the larger states argued that because they had more residents, they should be allotted more legislators to represent their interests (Figure 2.7).

[.my2]
小州的代表们反对弗吉尼亚方案 。另一项提案，即"新泽西方案" ，主张设立"一院制"立法机构 ，每个州拥有一票。这样，小州在"联邦立法机构"中将拥有与大州相同的权力。然而，大州辩称，由于其人口更多，因此应该分配更多议员, 来代表其利益（ 图 2.7 ）。

This infographic shows a comparison between the Virginia Plan on the left and the New Jersey Plan on the right. It depicts the type of legislature, representation, and role of the national government for each plan. In the Virginia Plan, the legislature is bicameral, representation is population based with a higher population yielding more representation, and the role of national government is to legislate for states and veto state law. In the New Jersey Plan, the legislature is unicameral, representation is state based with each state equally represented, and the role of national government is to provide defense but not override state authority.
Figure 2.7 The Virginia Plan called for a two-house legislature. Representation in both houses would be based on population. A state’s representatives in one house would be elected by the state’s voters. These representatives would then appoint representatives to the second house from among candidates chosen by the state’s legislature. The New Jersey Plan favored maintaining a one-house Congress with each state being equally represented.

[.my2]
图 2.7 弗吉尼亚方案, 主张设立"两院制"立法机构。两院的席位分配, 均以人口为基础。各州在一院的代表, 由该州选民选举产生。这些代表, 随后从"州议会"选出的候选人中, 任命另一院的代表。新泽西方案则倾向于维持"一院制国会"，各州席位均等。

=== Slavery and Freedom

[.my2]
奴隶制与自由


Another fundamental division separated the states. Following the Revolution, some of the northern states had either abolished slavery or instituted plans by which enslaved men and women would gradually be emancipated. Pennsylvania, for example, had passed the Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery in 1780. All people born in the state to enslaved mothers after the law’s passage would become indentured servants to be set free at age twenty-eight. In 1783, Massachusetts had freed all enslaved people within the state. Many Americans believed slavery was opposed to the ideals stated in the Declaration of Independence. Others felt it was inconsistent with the teachings of Christianity. Some White people feared for their safety if the enslaved population or Americans' reliance on slavery were to increase. Although some southerners shared similar sentiments, none of the southern states had abolished slavery and none wanted the Constitution to interfere with the institution. In addition to supporting the agriculture of the South, enslaved people could be taxed as property and counted as population for purposes of a state’s representation in the government.

[.my2]
另一个根本性的分歧在于各州之间的分裂。独立战争后，一些北方州要么废除了奴隶制 ，要么制定了逐步解放奴隶的计划。例如，宾夕法尼亚州于 1780 年通过了 《逐步废除奴隶制法案》。 该法案通过后，所有在该州出生的奴隶母亲的孩子, 都将成为"契约劳工"，并在 28 岁时获得自由。1783 年，马萨诸塞州解放了州内所有奴隶。许多美国人认为, 奴隶制违背了《独立宣言》中阐述的理想。另一些人则认为, 奴隶制与基督教教义相悖。一些白人担心，如果奴隶人口增加, 或美国人对奴隶制的依赖程度提高，他们的安全将受到威胁。虽然一些南方人也有类似的看法，但南方各州都没有废除奴隶制，也没有哪个州希望宪法干预奴隶制。除了支持南方的农业之外，奴隶还可以作为财产征税，并被计入人口，用于计算一个州在政府中的代表人数。

=== Federal Supremacy vs. State Sovereignty

[.my2]
联邦至上与州主权

Perhaps the greatest division among the states split those who favored a strong national government and those who favored limiting its powers and allowing states to govern themselves in most matters. Supporters of a strong central government argued that it was necessary for the survival and efficient functioning of the new nation. Without the authority to maintain and command an army and navy, the nation could not defend itself at a time when European powers still maintained formidable empires in North America. Without the power to tax and regulate trade, the government would not have enough money to maintain the nation’s defense, protect American farmers and manufacturers from foreign competition, create the infrastructure necessary for interstate commerce and communications, maintain foreign embassies, or pay federal judges and other government officials. Furthermore, other countries would be reluctant to loan money to the United States if the federal government lacked the ability to impose taxes in order to repay its debts. Besides giving more power to populous states, the Virginia Plan also favored a strong national government that would legislate for the states in many areas and would have the power to veto laws passed by state legislatures.

[.my2]
各州之间最大的分歧或许在于：一方支持建立强大的中央政府，另一方则主张限制中央政府的权力，允许各州在大多数事务上自治。支持"建立强大中央政府"的人认为，这对于新生国家的生存和高效运转,至关重要。如果没有权力维持和指挥陆军和海军，美国就无法在欧洲列强仍在北美维持强大帝国的时代,保卫自身。如果没有"征税"和"监管贸易"的权力，政府将没有足够的资金来维持国防、保护美国农民和制造商免受外国竞争、建设州际贸易和通信所需的基础设施、维持驻外使馆的运转，以及支付联邦法官和其他政府官员的薪水。此外，**如果联邦政府缺乏征税能力来偿还债务，其他国家也不愿向美国提供贷款。**除了赋予人口大州更多权力外，《弗吉尼亚方案》还主张建立一个强大的中央政府，在许多领域代表各州立法，并有权否决州议会通过的法律。

Others, however, feared that a strong national government might become too powerful and use its authority to oppress citizens and deprive them of their rights. They advocated a central government with sufficient authority to defend the nation but insisted that other powers be left to the states, which were believed to be better able to understand and protect the needs and interests of their residents. Such delegates approved the approach of the New Jersey Plan, which retained the unicameral Congress that had existed under the Articles of Confederation. It gave additional power to the national government, such as the power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce and to compel states to comply with laws passed by Congress. However, states still retained a lot of power, including power over the national government. Congress, for example, could not impose taxes without the consent of the states. Furthermore, the nation’s chief executive, appointed by the Congress, could be removed by Congress if state governors demanded it.

[.my2]
然而，另一些人则担心，强大的中央政府可能会权力过大，滥用职权压迫公民，剥夺他们的权利。他们主张建立一个拥有足够权力保卫国家的中央政府，但坚持认为其他权力应留给各州，因为**他们相信, 各州更能理解和保护本州居民的需求和利益。**这些代表, 赞同新泽西方案，该方案保留了邦联条例下存在的"一院制国会"。它赋予中央政府更多权力，例如监管州际和国际贸易, 以及强制各州遵守国会通过的法律。然而，各州仍然保留着许多权力，包括对中央政府的权力。例如，未经各州同意，国会不得征税。此外，由国会任命的国家元首，如果州长提出要求，国会可以将其罢免。

=== Individual Liberty vs. Social Stability

[.my2]
个人自由与社会稳定

The belief that the king and Parliament had deprived colonists of their liberties had led to the Revolution, and many feared the government of the United States might one day attempt to do the same. They wanted and expected their new government to guarantee the rights of life, liberty, and property. Others believed it was more important for the national government to maintain order, and this might require it to limit personal liberty at times. All Americans, however, desired that the government not intrude upon people’s rights to life, liberty, and property without reason.

[.my2]
人们普遍认为国王和议会剥夺了殖民地人民的自由，这种信念最终导致了革命的爆发。许多人担心美国政府有朝一日也会效仿。他们希望并期待新政府能够保障人民的生命、自由和财产权利。另一些人则认为，"国家政府维护秩序"更为重要，这有时可能需要限制个人自由。然而，所有美国人都希望, 政府不要无故侵犯人民的生命、自由和财产权利。

=== COMPROMISE AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN OF AMERICAN GOVERNMENT

[.my2]
妥协与美国政府的宪政设计


Beginning in May 1787 and throughout the long, hot Philadelphia summer, the delegations from twelve states discussed, debated, and finally—after compromising many times—by September had worked out a new blueprint for the nation. The document they created, the U.S. Constitution, was an ingenious instrument that allayed fears of a too-powerful central government and solved the problems that had beleaguered the national government under the Articles of Confederation. For the most part, it also resolved the conflicts between small and large states, northern and southern states, and those who favored a strong federal government and those who argued for state sovereignty.

[.my2]
从1787年5月开始，在费城漫长而炎热的夏季里，来自十二个州的代表团进行了讨论、辩论，最终在多次妥协之后，于9月制定出了一份新的国家蓝图。他们制定的这份文件——美国宪法——是一份巧妙的文书，它消除了人们对中央政府权力过大的担忧，并解决了邦联条例下困扰联邦政府的诸多问题。在很大程度上，它也化解了大小州之间、南北州之间，以及支持"建立强有力的联邦政府"和主张"州主权"的各方之间的冲突。

=== The Great Compromise

[.my2]
大妥协


The Constitution consists of a preamble and seven articles. The first three articles divide the national government into three branches—Congress, the executive branch, and the federal judiciary—and describe the powers and responsibilities of each. In Article I, ten sections describe the structure of Congress, the basis for representation and the requirements for serving in Congress, the length of Congressional terms, and the powers of Congress. The national legislature created by the article reflects the compromises reached by the delegates regarding such issues as representation, slavery, and national power.

[.my2]
宪法由序言和七条正文组成。前三条将国家政府分为三个分支——国会、行政部门, 和联邦司法部门——并阐述了每个分支的权力和职责。第一条的十个章节, 描述了国会的结构、代表制的基础, 和国会议员的任职要求、国会议员的任期, 以及国会的权力。该条所建立的国家立法机构, 体现了代表们在代表权、奴隶制和国家权力等问题上达成的妥协。

After debating at length over whether the Virginia Plan or the New Jersey Plan provided the best model for the nation’s legislature, the framers of the Constitution had ultimately arrived at what is called the Great Compromise, suggested by Roger Sherman of Connecticut. Congress, it was decided, would consist of two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state, regardless of size, would have two senators, making for equal representation as in the New Jersey Plan. Representation in the House would be based on population. Senators were to be appointed by state legislatures, a variation on the Virginia Plan. Members of the House of Representatives would be popularly elected by the voters in each state. Elected members of the House would be limited to two years in office before having to seek reelection, and those appointed to the Senate by each state’s political elite would serve a term of six years.

[.my2]
在就"弗吉尼亚方案"和"新泽西方案"哪个更适合作为"国家立法机构"的模式, 进行了长时间的辩论后，宪法的制定者们最终达成了由康涅狄格州的罗杰·谢尔曼提出的“ *大妥协*” 。根据该方案，国会将由参议院和众议院组成。**每个州，无论大小，都将拥有两名参议员，从而实现与"新泽西方案"相同的平等代表权。众议院的席位分配, 将基于人口数量。参议员由"各州议会"任命，**这是对弗吉尼亚方案的一种变体。*众议院议,员由各州选民"普选"产生。当选的众议员任期为两年，之后必须寻求连任；而由各州政治精英任命的"参议员",任期为六年。*

Congress was given great power, including the power to tax, maintain an army and a navy, and regulate trade and commerce. Congress had authority that the national government lacked under the Articles of Confederation. It could also coin and borrow money, grant patents and copyrights, declare war, and establish laws regulating naturalization and bankruptcy. While legislation could be proposed by either chamber of Congress, it had to pass both chambers by a majority vote before being sent to the president to be signed into law, and all bills to raise revenue had to begin in the House of Representatives. Only those men elected by the voters to represent them could impose taxes upon them. There would be no more taxation without representation.

[.my2]
国会被赋予了巨大的权力，包括征税权、维持陆军和海军的权力, 以及监管贸易和商业的权力。国会拥有"邦联条例"下"联邦政府"所不具备的权力。它还可以铸造和借贷货币、授予专利和版权、宣战, 以及制定规范入籍和破产的法律。*#虽然国会两院均可提出立法提案，但必须经两院多数票通过后, 才能送交总统签署成为法律，所有"增收法案"都必须由"众议院"发起。只有选民选举产生的代表, 才能向选民征税。从此以后，无代表权者不得征税。#*

=== The Three-Fifths Compromise and the Debates over Slavery

[.my2]
三分之五妥协案, 与奴隶制辩论

The Great Compromise that determined the structure of Congress soon led to another debate, however. When states took a census of their population for the purpose of allotting House representatives, should enslaved people be counted? Southern states were adamant that they should be, while delegates from northern states were vehemently opposed, arguing that representatives from southern states could not represent the interests of those enslaved. If enslaved people were not counted, however, southern states would have far fewer representatives in the House than northern states did. For example, if South Carolina were allotted representatives based solely on its free population, it would receive only half the number it would have received if enslaved people, who made up approximately 43 percent of the population, were included.

[.my2]
然而，决定国会结构的“大妥协”很快引发了另一场辩论。**各州进行人口普查以分配"众议院代表"名额时，奴隶是否应该被计入？**南方各州坚决认为应该计入，而**北方各州的代表则强烈反对，认为南方各州的代表无法代表奴隶的利益。**然而，**如果不计入奴隶，南方各州在"众议院"的代表人数, 将远少于北方各州。**例如，如果南卡罗来纳州仅根据其"自由人口"分配"代表名额"，那么它获得的代表人数, 将只有"将占该州人口约 43%的奴隶也计入后"的一半 。

The Three-Fifths Compromise, illustrated in Figure 2.8, resolved the impasse, although not in a manner that truly satisfied anyone. For purposes of Congressional apportionment, slaveholding states were allowed to count all their free population, including free African Americans and 60 percent (three-fifths) of their enslaved population. To mollify the north, the compromise also allowed counting 60 percent of a state’s enslaved population for federal taxation, although no such taxes were ever collected. Another compromise regarding the institution of slavery granted Congress the right to impose taxes on imports in exchange for a twenty-year prohibition on laws attempting to ban the importation of enslaved people to the United States, which would hurt the economy of southern states more than that of northern states. Because the southern states, especially South Carolina, had made it clear they would leave the convention if abolition were attempted, no serious effort was made by the framers to abolish slavery in the new nation, even though many delegates disapproved of the institution.

[.my2]
如图 2.8 所示， 五分之三妥协方案, 解决了僵局，但并未真正令任何人满意。为了国会席位分配，蓄奴州被允许计算其所有自由人口，包括自由的非裔美国人，以及其奴隶人口的 60%（五分之三）。为了安抚北方，该妥协方案还允许将各州 60%的奴隶人口, 计入联邦税收，尽管从未征收过此类税款。另一项关于奴隶制的妥协方案, 赋予国会对进口商品征税的权力，以换取 20 年内禁止制定"任何试图禁止向美国进口奴隶的法律"。这将对南方各州的经济造成比北方各州更大的损害。*由于南方各州，特别是南卡罗来纳州，已明确表示如果试图废除奴隶制，他们将退出"制宪会议"，因此，尽管许多代表反对奴隶制，但制宪者并未认真努力在新国家废除奴隶制。*

This graphic shows two boxes (Proposal 1 on the left and Proposal 2 on the right) with an arrow from each box that points downward to one box (Three-fifths Compromise) underneath the two top boxes. In Proposal 1, 5 citizens equal 5 votes, and 5 enslaved persons equal 5 votes. In Proposal 2, 5 citizens equal 5 votes, and 5 enslaved persons equal 0 votes. In the Three-Fifths Compromise, 5 citizens equal 5 votes, and 5 enslaved persons equal 3 votes.

[.my2]
这张图表展示了两个方框（左侧为提案1，右侧为提案2），每个方框都有一个箭头向下, 指向位于这两个上方方框下方的一个方框（五分之三妥协案）。在提案1中，5名公民相当于5票，5名 enslaved persons 相当于5票。在提案2中，5名公民相当于5票，5名 enslaved persons 相当于0票。*在五分之三妥协案中，5名公民相当于5票，5名 enslaved persons 相当于3票。*


Indeed, the Constitution contained two protections for slavery. Article I postponed the abolition of the foreign slave trade until 1808, and in the interim, those in slaveholding states were allowed to import as many enslaved people as they wished. Furthermore, the Constitution placed no restrictions on the domestic slave trade, so residents of one state could still sell enslaved people to other states. Article IV of the Constitution—which, among other things, required states to return freedom seekers to the states where they had been charged with crimes—also prevented the enslaved from gaining their freedom by escaping to states where slavery had been abolished. Clause 3 of Article IV (known as the fugitive slave clause) allowed enslavers to reclaim the enslaved in the states where they had fled.


[.my2]
**事实上，宪法中包含两项保护奴隶制的条款。**第一条将废除"对外奴隶贸易"的期限, 推迟到 1808 年，在此期间，蓄奴州可以随意进口奴隶。 此外，宪法对"国内奴隶贸易"没有任何限制，因此一个州的居民, 仍然可以将奴隶卖给其他州。宪法第四条——除其他内容外，*要求各州将"寻求自由者"送回"他们被指控犯罪的州"——这也阻止了"被奴役者"通过逃往已废除奴隶制的州, 来获得自由。第四条第三款（被称为"逃奴条款"）允许奴隶主在被奴役者逃往的州, 重新索回他们。*

=== Separation of Powers and Checks and Balances

[.my2]
权力分立与制衡


Although debates over slavery and representation in Congress occupied many at the convention, the chief concern was the challenge of increasing the authority of the national government while ensuring that it did not become too powerful. The framers resolved this problem through a separation of powers, dividing the national government into three separate branches and assigning different responsibilities to each one, as shown in Figure 2.9. They also created a system of checks and balances by giving each of three branches of government the power to restrict the actions of the others, thus requiring them to work together.

[.my2]
*尽管"制宪会议"上许多人都在讨论"奴隶制"和"国会代表权"问题，但最主要的问题, 是如何在扩大联邦政府权力的同时，确保其权力不会过大。制宪者通过"权力分立"解决了这个问题，将联邦政府分为三个独立的部门，并为每个部门分配不同的职责，* 如图 2.9 所示。*他们还建立了一套"权力制衡机制"，赋予政府的三个部门各自限制其他部门行动的权力，从而促使它们相互协作。*


image:/img/008.webp[,100%]

Figure 2.9 To prevent the national government, or any one group within it, from becoming too powerful, the Constitution divided the government into three branches with different powers. No branch could function without the cooperation of the others, and each branch could restrict the powers of the others.


[.my2]
图 2.9 *为了防止国家政府, 或其中的任何一个团体权力过大，宪法将政府, 分为三个权力不同的部门。任何一个部门都不能脱离其他部门的合作, 而独立运作，而且每个部门都可以限制其他部门的权力。*


This infographic includes three boxes with Executive, Judicial, and Legislative headings. The powers listed for the executive branch are: President is commander-in0chief of the nation’s armed forces; President is responsible for conducting foreign affairs; President appoints federal judges, ambassadors, and the heads of executive departments; President may grant pardons to those who have broken federal laws; President has the power to veto legislation passed by Congress. The powers listed for the judicial branch are: Supreme Court hears cases involving federal law and is the nation’s final court of appeal; Supreme Court has the power to declare laws and actions by the executive branch unconstitutional; Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presides over impeachment trials. The powers listed for the legislative branch are: Congress has the power to pass legislation; Congress may declare war; Senate has the power to ratify treaties signed by the president; Senate must give its consent to the president’s appointment of federal judges, ambassadors, and the heads of executive departments; Congress may impeach the president and remove the president from office; Congress may establish the number of Supreme Court justices and regular the Court’s jurisdiction.

[.my2]
这张信息图包含三个方框，标题分别为行政、司法和立法。行政部门列出的权力包括：总统是国家武装部队的总司令；**总统负责处理外交事务；总统任命联邦法官、大使和行政部门负责人；**总统可对违反联邦法律者予以赦免；**总统有权否决"国会通过的立法"。**司法部门列出的权力包括：最高法院审理涉及联邦法律的案件，是国家的最终上诉法院；**最高法院有权宣布法律和行政部门的行为违宪；**最高法院首席大法官主持弹劾审判。立法部门列出的权力包括：*国会有权通过立法；国会可宣战；参议院有权批准总统签署的条约；参议院必须同意总统对联邦法官、大使和行政部门负责人的任命；国会可以弹劾总统并将其免职；国会可以设立最高法院大法官的人数并规范法院的管辖权。*


Congress was given the power to make laws, but the executive branch, consisting of the president and the vice president, and the federal judiciary, notably the Supreme Court, were created to, respectively, enforce laws and try cases arising under federal law. Neither of these branches had existed under the Articles of Confederation. Thus, Congress can pass laws, but its power to do so can be checked by the president, who can veto potential legislation so that it cannot become a law. Later, in the 1803 case of Marbury v. Madison, the U.S. Supreme Court established its own authority to rule on the constitutionality of laws, a process called judicial review.

[.my2]
国会被赋予立法权，但由总统和副总统组成的行政部门, 以及以"最高法院"为代表的联邦司法机构，分别负责执行法律和审理联邦法律下的案件。这两个部门在《邦联条例》时期并不存在。因此，##**国会可以立法，但其"立法权"受到总统的制约，总统可以否决"潜在的立法"，使其无法成为法律。**##后来，在 1803 年的 “马伯里诉麦迪逊案”中，*"美国最高法院"确立了其对"法律合宪性"进行裁决的权力，这一程序被称为"司法审查"。*

Other examples of checks and balances include the ability of Congress to limit the president’s veto. Should the president veto a bill passed by both houses of Congress, the bill is returned to Congress to be voted on again. If the bill passes both the House of Representatives and the Senate with a two-thirds vote in its favor, it becomes law even though the president has refused to sign it.

[.my2]
"制衡机制"的其他例子, 还包括**国会限制"总统否决权"的能力。如果总统否决了国会两院通过的法案，该法案将被退回国会重新表决。如果该法案在众议院和参议院均获得三分之二的赞成票，即使总统拒绝签署，该法案也将成为法律。**

Congress is also able to limit the president’s power as commander-in-chief of the armed forces by refusing to declare war or provide funds for the military. To date, the Congress has never refused a president’s request for a declaration of war. The president must also seek the advice and consent of the Senate before appointing members of the Supreme Court and ambassadors, and the Senate must approve the ratification of all treaties signed by the president. Congress may even remove the president from office. To do this, both chambers of Congress must work together. The House of Representatives impeaches the president by bringing formal charges against the president, and the Senate tries the case in a proceeding overseen by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The president is removed from office if found guilty.

##**国会还可以通过拒绝宣战, 或拒绝拨款, 来限制总统作为武装部队总司令的权力。**##迄今为止，国会从未拒绝过总统的宣战请求。**总统在任命"最高法院大法官"和"大使"之前，必须征得"参议院"的意见和同意；参议院也必须批准总统签署的所有条约。国会甚至可以罢免总统。要做到这一点，国会两院必须共同合作。众议院通过对总统提出正式指控来弹劾总统，参议院则在最高法院首席大法官的监督下进行审理。**如果总统被判有罪，他将被免职。

According to political scientist Richard Neustadt, the system of separation of powers and checks and balances does not so much allow one part of government to control another as it encourages the branches to cooperate. Instead of a true separation of powers, the Constitutional Convention “created a government of separated institutions sharing powers.”10 For example, knowing the president can veto a law the president disapproves, Congress will attempt to draft a bill that addresses the president’s concerns before sending it to the White House for signing. Similarly, knowing that Congress can override a veto, the president will use this power sparingly.

政治学家理查德·纽斯塔特认为，*"权力分立"和"制衡体系", 并非允许政府的一个部门控制另一个部门，而是鼓励各部门合作。#"制宪会议"并没有真正实现"权力分立"，而是“创建了一个由'权力共享的独立机构'组成的政府”。# 例如 ，由于总统知道他可以否决自己不认可的法律，国会会在将法案送交白宫签署之前，努力起草一份能够解决总统顾虑的法案。同样，由于总统知道国会可以推翻总统的否决，因此他会谨慎使用这项权力。*

=== Federal Power vs. State Power

[.my2]
联邦权力与州权力

The strongest guarantee that the power of the national government would be restricted and the states would retain a degree of sovereignty was the framers’ creation of a federal system of government. In a federal system, power is divided between the federal (or national) government and the state governments. Great or explicit powers, called enumerated powers, were granted to the federal government to declare war, impose taxes, coin and regulate currency, regulate foreign and interstate commerce, raise and maintain an army and a navy, maintain a post office, make treaties with foreign nations and with Native American tribes, and make laws regulating the naturalization of immigrants.

限制国家权力、保障各州保留一定主权的最有力保障，是制宪者们创建的"联邦制政府体系"。**在联邦制下 ，权力在联邦政府（或国家政府）和州政府之间进行划分。**联邦政府被赋予了诸多重大或明确的权力，称为"列举权力" ，包括:宣战、征税、铸造和管理货币、管理对外和州际贸易、组建和维持陆军和海军、设立邮政系统、与外国和美洲原住民部落缔结条约，以及制定"移民入籍法律"。

All powers not expressly given to the national government, however, were intended to be exercised by the states. These powers are known as reserved powers (Figure 2.10). Thus, states remained free to pass laws regarding such things as intrastate commerce (commerce within the borders of a state) and marriage. Some powers, such as the right to levy taxes, were given to both the state and federal governments. Both the states and the federal government have a chief executive to enforce the laws (a governor and the president, respectively) and a system of courts.

所有未明确授予联邦政府的权力，都旨在由各州行使。这些权力被称为"保留权力 "（ 图 2.10 ）。因此，各州仍然可以自由制定有关州内贸易（州界内的商业活动）,和婚姻等方面的法律。##**一些权力，例如"征税权"，则同时授予州政府和联邦政府。**##州政府和联邦政府都设有行政长官, 来执行法律（分别是州长和总统），以及一套法院系统。


Figure 2.10 Reserve powers allow the states to pass intrastate legislation, such as laws on commerce, drug use, and marriage (a). However, sometimes judicial rulings at the federal level may supersede such legislation, as happened in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), the recent Supreme Court case regarding marriage equality (b).

图 2.10 "保留权力"允许各州通过"州内立法"，例如有关商业、毒品使用和婚姻的法律 (a)。**然而，有时联邦层面的司法裁决, 可能会凌驾于此类立法之上，**例如最近最高法院审理的关于婚姻平等的案件—— 奥贝格费尔诉霍奇斯案 (2015) (b)。（图片来源：a：改编自 Damian Gadal 的作品；b：改编自 Ludovic Bertron 的作品）




Although the states retained a considerable degree of sovereignty, the supremacy clause in Article VI of the Constitution proclaimed that the Constitution, laws passed by Congress, and treaties made by the federal government were “the supreme Law of the Land.” In the event of a conflict between the states and the national government, the national government would triumph. Furthermore, although the federal government was to be limited to those powers enumerated in the Constitution, Article I provided for the expansion of Congressional powers if needed. The “necessary and proper” clause of Article I provides that Congress may “make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing [enumerated] Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.”

**尽管各州保留了相当大的主权，但宪法第六条的最高条款宣布，#宪法、国会通过的法律, 以及联邦政府缔结的条约, 是“国家的最高法律”。#**如果各州与联邦政府发生冲突，联邦政府将胜诉。**此外，尽管联邦政府的权力应限于宪法列举的权力，但第一条规定，如有必要，国会可以扩大权力。**第一条的“必要且适当”条款规定，国会可以“制定一切为执行上述[列举的]权力, 以及本宪法赋予美国政府或其任何部门或官员的所有其他权力所必需和适当的法律”。

The Constitution also gave the federal government control over all “Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.” This would prove problematic when, as the United States expanded westward and population growth led to an increase in the power of the northern states in Congress, the federal government sought to restrict the expansion of slavery into newly acquired territories.

宪法还赋予联邦政府对所有“属于美国的领土或其他财产”的控制权。随着美国向西扩张，人口增长导致北方各州在国会的权力增加，联邦政府试图限制奴隶制向新获得的领土扩张，这便造成了问题。
