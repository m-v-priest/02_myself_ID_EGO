== 释义




The idea of public policy is by its very nature a politically contentious one. Among the differences between American liberals and conservatives are the policy preferences prevalent in each group. Modern liberals tend to feel very comfortable with the idea of the government shepherding progressive social and economic reforms, believing that these will lead to outcomes more equitable and fair for all members of society. Conservatives, on the other hand, often find government involvement onerous and overreaching. They feel society would function more efficiently if oversight of most “public” matters were returned to the private sphere. Before digging too deeply into a discussion of the nature of public policy in the United States, let us look first at why so many aspects of society come under the umbrella of public policy to begin with.

公共政策的概念本身就极具政治争议性。美国自由派和保守派之间的分歧之一在于各自不同的政策偏好。现代自由派往往乐于接受政府主导进步的社会和经济改革，他们认为这些改革将为社会所有成员带来更加公平公正的结果。而保守派则常常觉得政府干预繁琐且权力过大。他们认为，如果将大多数“公共”事务的监管权交还给私人领域，社会运转会更加高效。在深入探讨美国公共政策的本质之前，我们首先来探究一下，为什么社会的诸多方面都会被纳入公共政策的范畴。

DIFFERENT TYPES OF GOODS
不同类型的商品
Think for a minute about what it takes to make people happy and satisfied. As we live our daily lives, we experience a range of physical, psychological, and social needs that must be met in order for us to be happy and productive. At the very least, we require food, water, and shelter. In very basic subsistence societies, people acquire these through farming crops, digging wells, and creating shelter from local materials (see Figure 16.4). People also need social interaction with others and the ability to secure goods they acquire, lest someone else try to take them. As their tastes become more complex, they may find it advantageous to exchange their items for others; this requires not only a mechanism for barter but also a system of transportation. The more complex these systems are, the greater the range of items people can access to keep them alive and make them happy. However, this increase in possessions also creates a stronger need to secure what they have acquired.

请思考片刻，是什么让人们感到幸福和满足？在日常生活中，我们会经历一系列生理、心理和社会需求，这些需求必须得到满足，我们才能感到幸福并高效工作。至少，我们需要食物、水和住所。在非常原始的自给自足社会中，人们通过耕种作物、挖掘水井和利用当地材料建造住所来获取这些（见图 16.4 ）。人们还需要与他人进行社会互动，并有能力保护自己获得的物品，以免被他人夺走。随着人们的需求变得更加复杂，他们可能会发现用自己的物品交换他人的物品更有利；这不仅需要物物交换机制，还需要交通运输系统。这些系统越复杂，人们能够获得的维持生存和获得幸福的物品种类就越多。然而，拥有的物品越多，人们就越需要保护自己所获得的东西。

Economists use the term goods to describe the range of commodities, services, and systems that help us satisfy our wants or needs. This term can certainly apply to the food you eat or the home you live in, but it can also describe the systems of transportation or public safety used to protect them. Most of the goods you interact with in your daily life are private goods, which means that they can be owned by a particular person or group of people, and are excluded from use by others, typically by means of a price. For example, your home or apartment is a private good reserved for your own use because you pay rent or make mortgage payments for the privilege of living there. Further, private goods are finite and can run out if overused, even if only in the short term. The fact that private goods are excludable and finite makes them tradable. A farmer who grows corn, for instance, owns that corn, and since only a finite amount of corn exists, others may want to trade their goods for it if their own food supplies begin to dwindle.

[.my2]
经济学家用 “商品” 一词来描述帮助我们满足自身需求或欲望的各种商品、服务和系统。这个词当然可以指你吃的食物或你居住的房屋，但也可以用来描述用于保护这些物品的交通运输系统或公共安全系统。你在日常生活中接触到的绝大多数商品都是私人商品 ，这意味着它们可以由特定的人或群体拥有，并且通常通过价格来限制他人使用。例如，你的房屋或公寓就是一种私人商品，因为你支付租金或抵押贷款来获得居住权，所以它仅供你自己使用。此外， 私人商品是有限的，即使只是短期内过度使用，也会耗尽。正是由于私人商品具有排他性和有限性，它们才具有可交易性。例如，种植玉米的农民拥有这些玉米，由于玉米的数量有限，如果其他人的粮食供应开始减少，他们可能就愿意用自己的玉米来交换。

Proponents of free-market economics believe that the market forces of supply and demand, working without any government involvement, are the most effective way for markets to operate. One of the basic principles of free-market economics is that for just about any good that can be privatized, the most efficient means for exchange is the marketplace. A well-functioning market will allow producers of goods to come together with consumers of goods to negotiate a trade. People facilitate trade by creating a currency—a common unit of exchange—so they do not need to carry around everything they may want to trade at all times. As long as there are several providers or sellers of the same good, consumers can negotiate with them to find a price they are willing to pay. As long as there are several buyers for a seller’s goods, providers can negotiate with them to find a price buyers are willing to accept. And, the logic goes, if prices begin to rise too much, other sellers will enter the marketplace, offering lower prices.

[.my2]
自由市场经济的支持者认为，在没有任何政府干预的情况下，供求关系的市场力量是市场运作最有效的方式。自由市场经济的基本原则之一是，对于几乎所有可以私有化的商品而言，最有效的交换方式就是市场。一个运转良好的市场能够让商品生产者和消费者聚集在一起，协商交易。人们通过创造货币——一种通用的交换单位——来促进交易，这样他们就不必随时携带所有想要交易的物品。只要有多个同类商品的提供者或卖家，消费者就可以与他们协商，找到自己愿意支付的价格。只要有多个买家购买卖家的商品，提供者就可以与他们协商，找到买家愿意接受的价格。而且，按照这种逻辑，如果价格上涨过高，其他卖家就会进入市场，提供更低的价格。

A second basic principle of free-market economics is that it is largely unnecessary for the government to protect the value of private goods. Farmers who own land used for growing food have a vested interest in protecting their land to ensure its continued production. Business owners must protect the reputation of their business or no one will buy from them. And, to the degree that producers need to ensure the quality of their product or industry, they can accomplish that by creating a group or association that operates outside government control. In short, industries have an interest in self-regulating to protect their own value. According to free-market economics, as long as everything we could ever want or need is a private good, and so long as every member of society has some ability to provide for themselves and their families, public policy regulating the exchange of goods and services is really unnecessary.

[.my2]
自由市场经济学的第二个基本原则是，政府在很大程度上没有必要保护私人产品的价值。拥有土地用于种植粮食的农民有既得利益来保护他们的土地，以确保其持续生产。企业主必须维护其企业的声誉，否则无人问津。而且，如果生产者需要确保其产品或行业的质量，他们可以通过建立不受政府控制的团体或协会来实现。简而言之，各行业有自我监管的利益来保护自身的价值。根据自由市场经济学，只要我们想要或需要的一切都是私人产品，只要社会中的每个成员都有能力养活自己和家人，那么监管商品和服务交换的公共政策就真的没有必要。

Some people in the United States argue that the self-monitoring and self-regulating incentives provided by the existence of private goods mean that sound public policy requires very little government action. Known as libertarians, these individuals believe government almost always operates less efficiently than the private sector (the segment of the economy run for profit and not under government control), and that government actions should therefore be kept to a minimum.

[.my2]
美国有些人认为，私人产品的存在所带来的自我监督和自我调节激励机制意味着，健全的公共政策几乎不需要政府干预。这些人被称为自由意志主义者 ，他们认为政府的运作效率几乎总是低于私营部门（经济中以盈利为目的且不受政府控制的部分），因此政府干预应该尽可能少。

Even as many in the United States recognize the benefits provided by private goods, we have increasingly come to recognize problems with the idea that all social problems can be solved by exclusively private ownership. First, not all goods can be classified as strictly private. Can you really consider the air you breathe to be private? Air is a difficult good to privatize because it is not excludable—everyone can get access to it at all times—and no matter how much of it you breathe, there is still plenty to go around. Geographic regions like forests have environmental, social, recreational, and aesthetic value that cannot easily be reserved for private ownership. Resources like migrating birds or schools of fish may have value if hunted or fished, but they cannot be owned due to their migratory nature. Finally, national security provided by the armed forces protects all citizens and cannot reasonably be reserved for only a few.

[.my2]
尽管许多美国人认识到私有财产带来的益处，但我们也越来越意识到，认为所有社会问题都能完全通过私有制解决的观点存在问题。首先，并非所有商品都能被严格归类为私有财产。你真的能把呼吸的空气视为私有财产吗？空气难以私有化，因为它不具有排他性——每个人都可以随时获得——而且无论你呼吸多少空气，空气资源依然充足。像森林这样的地理区域具有环境、社会、娱乐和美学价值，这些价值难以被私有化。像候鸟或鱼群这样的资源，如果被猎捕或捕捞，可能具有价值，但由于其迁徙特性，它们不能被私有化。最后，由武装部队提供的国家安全保护所有公民，不能合理地只为少数人保留。

These are all examples of what economists call public goods, sometimes referred to as collective goods. Unlike private property, they are not excludable and are essentially infinite. Forests, water, and fisheries, however, are a type of public good called common goods, which are not excludable but may be finite. The problem with both public and common goods is that since no one owns them, no one has a financial interest in protecting their long-term or future value. Without government regulation, factory owners can feel free to pollute the air or water, since they will have no responsibility for the pollution once the winds or waves carry it somewhere else (see Figure 16.5). Without government regulation, someone can hunt all the migratory birds or deplete a fishery by taking all the fish, eliminating future breeding stocks that would maintain the population. The situation in which individuals exhaust a common resource by acting in their own immediate self-interest is called the tragedy of the commons.

[.my2]
这些都是经济学家所说的公共物品的例子，有时也称为集体物品。与私有财产不同，它们不具有排他性，而且本质上是无限的。然而，森林、水和渔业资源属于一种被称为共同物品的公共物品 ，它们不具有排他性，但可能是有限的。公共物品和共同物品的问题在于，由于它们不属于任何人所有，因此没有人有经济利益去保护它们的长期或未来价值。如果没有政府监管，工厂主可以随意污染空气或水，因为一旦污染物被风或海浪带到别处，他们就无需承担任何责任（见图 16.5 ）。如果没有政府监管，有人可以猎杀所有候鸟，或者捕捞所有鱼类，从而耗尽渔业资源，破坏维持种群的未来繁殖种群。个人为了自身眼前的利益而耗尽公共资源的情况被称为公地悲剧 。

Figure 16.5 Air pollution billows from a power plant before the installation of emission control equipment for the removal of sulfur dioxide and particulate matter. Can you see why uncontrolled pollution is an example of the “tragedy of the commons”?
图 16.5 显示，在安装用于去除二氧化硫和颗粒物的排放控制设备之前，发电厂排放的空气污染物滚滚而出。你能看出为什么不受控制的污染是“公地悲剧”的一个例子吗？
A second problem with strict adherence to free-market economics is that some goods are too large, or too expensive, for individuals to provide them for themselves. Consider the need for a marketplace: Where does the marketplace come from? How do we get the goods to market? Who provides the roads and bridges? Who patrols the waterways? Who provides security? Who ensures the regulation of the currency? No individual buyer or seller could accomplish this. The very nature of the exchange of private goods requires a system that has some of the openness of public or common goods, but is maintained by either groups of individuals or entire societies.

[.my2]
严格遵循自由市场经济的第二个问题是，有些商品数量太多或价格太高，个人无法自行提供。想想市场存在的必要性：市场从何而来？商品如何运往市场？谁来修建道路和桥梁？谁来巡逻水道？谁来提供安保？谁来监管货币？任何个人买家或卖家都无法独自完成这一切。私人物品交换的本质决定了它需要一个既具有公共物品或共有物品的开放性，又由个人群体或整个社会来维护的体系。

Economists consider goods like cable TV, cellphone service, and private schools to be toll goods. Toll goods are similar to public goods in that they are open to all and theoretically infinite if maintained, but they are paid for or provided by some outside (nongovernment) entity. Many people can make use of them, but only if they can pay the price. The name “toll goods” comes from the fact that, early on, many toll roads were in fact privately owned commodities. Even today, states from Virginia to California have allowed private companies to build public roads in exchange for the right to profit by charging tolls.7
经济学家将有线电视、手机服务和私立学校等商品视为收费商品 。 收费商品与公共物品类似，它们对所有人开放，理论上如果维持下去可以无限供应，但它们是由外部（非政府）实体支付或提供的。许多人都可以使用这些商品，但前提是他们能够支付相应的费用。“收费商品 ”这个名称来源于这样一个事实：早期许多收费公路实际上是私人拥有的。即使在今天，从弗吉尼亚州到加利福尼亚州，许多州仍然允许私人公司修建公共道路，以换取收取通行费获利的权利。

So long as land was plentiful, and most people in the United States lived a largely rural subsistence lifestyle, the difference between private, public, common, and toll goods was mostly academic. But as public lands increasingly became private through sale and settlement, and as industrialization and the rise of mass production allowed monopolies and oligopolies to become more influential, support for public policies regulating private entities grew. By the beginning of the twentieth century, led by the Progressives, the United States had begun to search for ways to govern large businesses that had managed to distort market forces by monopolizing the supply of goods. And, largely as a result of the Great Depression, people wanted ways of developing and protecting public goods that were fairer and more equitable than had existed before. These forces and events led to the increased regulation of public and common goods, and a move for the public sector—the government—to take over of the provision of many toll goods.

[.my2]
只要土地资源丰富，且美国大多数人仍过着以自给自足为主的乡村生活，私人财产、公共财产、共有财产和收费财产之间的区别就基本只是理论上的。但随着公共土地通过出售和定居点逐渐私有化，以及工业化和大规模生产的兴起使得垄断和寡头垄断的影响力日益增强，人们越来越支持对私营实体进行公共监管的政策。到了 20 世纪初，在进步主义者的领导下，美国开始寻求监管大型企业的方法，这些企业通过垄断商品供应扭曲了市场力量。此外，很大程度上由于大萧条的影响，人们希望找到比以往更加公平公正的公共财产开发和保护方式。这些因素和事件导致了对公共财产和共有财产监管的加强，以及公共部门——即政府——接管许多收费财产供应的趋势。

CLASSIC TYPES OF POLICY
经典保单类型
Public policy, then, ultimately boils down to determining the distribution, allocation, and enjoyment of public, common, and toll goods within a society. While the specifics of policy often depend on the circumstances, two broad questions all policymakers must consider are a) who pays the costs of creating and maintaining the goods, and b) who receives the benefits of the goods? When private goods are bought and sold in a market place, the costs and benefits go to the participants in the transaction. Your landlord benefits from receipt of the rent you pay, and you benefit by having a place to live. But non-private goods like roads, waterways, and national parks are controlled and regulated by someone other than the owners, allowing policymakers to make decisions about who pays and who benefits.

[.my2]
因此，公共政策归根结底在于确定社会内部公共物品、共有物品和收费物品的分配、配置和享用方式。虽然政策的具体细节往往取决于具体情况，但所有政策制定者都必须考虑两个总体问题：a) 谁承担创造和维护这些物品的成本？b) 谁享受这些物品带来的利益？当私人物品在市场上买卖时，成本和收益都归交易参与者所有。房东从你支付的租金中获益，而你则从拥有住所中获益。但道路、水道和国家公园等非私人物品由所有者以外的其他人控制和管理，这使得政策制定者可以决定谁来支付成本，谁来受益。

In 1964, Theodore Lowi argued that it was possible to categorize policy based upon the degree to which costs and benefits were concentrated on the few or diffused across the many. One policy category, known as distributive policy, tends to collect payments or resources from many but concentrates direct benefits on relatively few. Highways are often developed through distributive policy. Distributive policy is also common when society feels there is a social benefit to individuals obtaining private goods such as higher education that offer long-term benefits, but the upfront cost may be too high for the average citizen.

[.my2]
1964 年，西奥多· 洛伊提出，可以根据成本和收益集中于少数人还是分散于多数人的程度，对政策进行分类。其中一类政策被称为分配性政策 ，这类政策倾向于从多数人那里收取费用或资源，但直接收益却集中在相对少数人身上。高速公路的建设通常就是通过分配性政策实现的。当社会认为个人获得诸如高等教育等能够带来长期效益的私人产品具有社会效益，但前期成本对普通民众而言可能过高时，分配性政策也十分常见。

One example of the way distributive policy works is the story of the Transcontinental Railroad. In the 1860s, the U.S. government began to recognize the value of building a robust railroad system to move passengers and freight around the country. A particular goal was connecting California and the other western territories acquired during the 1840s war with Mexico to the rest of the country. The problem was that constructing a nationwide railroad system was a costly and risky proposition. To build and support continuous rail lines, private investors would need to gain access to tens of thousands of miles of land, some of which might be owned by private citizens. The solution was to charter two private corporations—the Central Pacific and Union Pacific Railroads—and provide them with resources and land grants to facilitate the construction of the railroads (see Figure 16.6).8 Through these grants, publicly owned land was distributed to private citizens, who could then use it for their own gain. However, a broader public gain was simultaneously being provided in the form of a nationwide transportation network.

[.my2]
分配政策运作的一个例证是横贯大陆铁路的故事。19 世纪 60 年代，美国政府开始意识到建设一个强大的铁路系统对于在全国范围内运输乘客和货物的重要性。其中一个重要目标是将加利福尼亚州以及在 19 世纪 40 年代美墨战争期间获得的其他西部领土与美国其他地区连接起来。问题在于，建设一个覆盖全国的铁路系统是一项成本高昂且风险巨大的工程。为了建设和维护连续的铁路线，私人投资者需要获得数万英里的土地，其中一些土地可能属于私人所有。解决方案是成立两家私营公司——中央太平洋铁路公司和联合太平洋铁路公司——并向它们提供资源和土地赠予，以促进铁路建设（见图 16.6 ）。通过这些赠予，公共土地被分配给了私人，他们可以将其用于自身利益。然而，与此同时，一个覆盖全国的交通网络也带来了更广泛的公共利益。

图 16.6 分配政策的一个例子是，联合太平洋铁路公司获得了土地和资源，用于建设国家铁路系统。图中，该公司的工人们于 1869 年在犹他州建造了魔鬼门大桥。
The same process operates in the agricultural sector, where various federal programs help farmers and food producers through price supports and crop insurance, among other forms of assistance. These programs help individual farmers and agriculture companies stay afloat and realize consistent profits. They also achieve the broader goal of providing plenty of sustenance for the people of the United States, so that few of us have to “live off the land.”
同样的道理也适用于农业领域。联邦政府通过各种项目，例如价格支持和作物保险等援助方式，帮助农民和食品生产商维持生计。这些项目不仅帮助个体农民和农业公司维持运营，实现稳定的盈利，也实现了更广泛的目标，即为美国人民提供充足的食物，使大多数人不必“靠土地为生”。

胡佛水坝：联邦政府驯服科罗拉多河的尝试
As westward expansion led to development of the American Southwest, settlers increasingly realized that they needed a way to control the frequent floods and droughts that made agriculture difficult in the region. As early as 1890, land speculators had tried diverting the Colorado River for this purpose, but it wasn’t until 1922 that the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (then called the Reclamation Service) chose the Black Canyon as a good location for a dam to divert the river. Since it would affect seven states (as well as Mexico), the federal government took the lead on the project, which eventually cost $49 million and more than one hundred lives. The dam faced significant opposition from members of other states, who felt its massive price tag (almost $670 million in today’s dollars9) benefitted only a small group, not the whole nation. However, in 1928, Senator Hiram Johnson and Representative Phil Swing, both Republicans from California, won the day. Congress passed the Boulder Canyon Project Act, authorizing the construction of one of the most ambitious engineering feats in U.S. history. The Hoover Dam (Figure 16.7), completed in 1935, served the dual purposed of generating hydroelectric power and irrigating two million acres of land from the resulting reservoir (Lake Mead).

[.my2]
随着西进运动推动美国西南部的发展，定居者们日益意识到，他们需要一种方法来控制该地区频繁发生的洪水和干旱，因为这些灾害使得农业生产举步维艰。早在 1890 年，土地投机者就曾尝试改道科罗拉多河以达到此目的，但直到 1922 年，美国垦务局（当时称为垦务署）才选定黑峡谷作为修建水坝改道科罗拉多河的理想地点。由于该项目将影响七个州（以及墨西哥），联邦政府主导了这项工程，最终耗资 4900 万美元，并造成一百多人丧生。水坝的修建遭到了其他州议员的强烈反对，他们认为其巨额成本（按今天的美元计算，接近 6.7 亿美元）只会惠及少数人，而非整个国家。然而，在 1928 年，来自加利福尼亚州的共和党参议员海勒姆·约翰逊和众议员菲尔·斯温最终取得了胜利。国会通过了《 博尔德峡谷工程法案》 ，授权建造美国历史上最雄心勃勃的工程之一。胡佛大坝（ 图 16.7 ）于 1935 年竣工，其双重用途是发电和利用由此形成的水库（米德湖）灌溉 200 万英亩土地。

Other examples of distributive policy support citizens’ efforts to achieve “the American Dream.” American society recognizes the benefits of having citizens who are financially invested in the country’s future. Among the best ways to encourage this investment are to ensure that citizens are highly educated and have the ability to acquire high-cost private goods such as homes and businesses. However, very few people have the savings necessary to pay upfront for a college education, a first home purchase, or the start-up costs of a business. To help out, the government has created a range of incentives that everyone in the country pays for through taxes but that directly benefit only the recipients. Examples include grants (such as Pell grants), tax credits and deductions, and subsidized or federally guaranteed loans. Each of these programs aims to achieve a policy outcome. Pell grants exist to help students graduate from college, whereas Federal Housing Administration mortgage loans lead to home ownership. A related distributive project is the effort to bring broadband internet to remote rural areas of the country that have disproportionately felt the negative effects of the digital divide. Such a project is the most ambitious infrastructure initiative since the Rural Electrification Act. Broadband is spreading slowly for now, mostly helped along by rural co-ops. However, multiple federal agencies are investigating how to help this effort, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Federal Communications Commission.

[.my2]
其他分配性政策的例子也支持公民努力实现“美国梦”。美国社会认识到，公民对国家未来进行经济投入至关重要。鼓励这种投资的最佳途径之一是确保公民接受高等教育，并有能力获得高成本的私人资产，例如住房和企业。然而，很少有人拥有足够的积蓄来支付大学教育、首次购房或创业的启动资金。为了提供帮助，政府设立了一系列激励措施，这些措施由全国人民通过税收支付，但只有受益人才能直接受益。例如，助学金（如佩尔助学金）、税收抵免和扣除，以及补贴贷款或联邦担保贷款。每个项目都旨在实现特定的政策目标。佩尔助学金旨在帮助学生完成大学学业，而联邦住房管理局的抵押贷款则旨在帮助人们拥有住房。另一个相关的分配性项目是努力将宽带互联网接入到受数字鸿沟负面影响尤为严重的偏远农村地区。该项目是自《农村电气化法案》以来规模最大的基础设施建设计划。目前宽带普及速度缓慢，主要依靠农村合作社的推动。然而，包括美国农业部和联邦通信委员会在内的多个联邦机构正在研究如何助力这项工作。

While distributive policy, according to Lowi, has diffuse costs and concentrated benefits, regulatory policy features the opposite arrangement, with concentrated costs and diffuse benefits. A relatively small number of groups or individuals bear the costs of regulatory policy, but its benefits are expected to be distributed broadly across society. As you might imagine, regulatory policy is most effective for controlling or protecting public or common resources. Among the best-known examples are policies designed to protect public health and safety, and the environment. These regulatory policies prevent manufacturers or businesses from maximizing their profits by excessively polluting the air or water, selling products they know to be harmful, or compromising the health of their employees during production.

[.my2]
根据洛伊的观点，分配性政策的成本分散而收益集中，而监管性政策则恰恰相反，成本集中而收益分散。监管性政策的成本由相对较少的群体或个人承担，但其收益预计会广泛惠及整个社会。正如您所想，监管性政策在控制或保护公共资源方面最为有效。其中最著名的例子包括旨在保护公众健康与安全以及环境的政策。这些监管性政策可以防止制造商或企业通过过度污染空气或水、销售明知有害的产品或在生产过程中损害员工健康来最大化利润。

In the United States, nationwide calls for a more robust regulatory policy first grew loud around the turn of the twentieth century and the dawn of the Industrial Age. Investigative journalists—called muckrakers by politicians and business leaders who were the focus of their investigations—began to expose many of the ways in which manufacturers were abusing the public trust. Although various forms of corruption topped the list of abuses, among the most famous muckraker exposés was The Jungle, a 1906 novel by Upton Sinclair that focused on unsanitary working conditions and unsavory business practices in the meat-packing industry.10 This work and others like it helped to spur the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act (1906) and ultimately led to the creation of government agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).11 The nation’s experiences during the depression of 1896 and the Great Depression of the 1930s also led to more robust regulatory policies designed to improve the transparency of financial markets and prevent monopolies from forming.

[.my2]
在美国，要求加强监管政策的呼声在 20 世纪初工业时代初期开始高涨。调查记者——被他们调查的对象，即政客和商界领袖，称为 “揭丑记者” ——开始揭露制造商滥用公众信任的种种行径。尽管各种形式的腐败位列滥用职权行为之首，但最著名的揭丑作品之一是厄普顿 ·辛克莱于 1906 年出版的小说 《屠场》 。这部小说聚焦于肉类加工业恶劣的工作环境和不光彩的商业行为。 10 这部作品以及其他类似作品推动了《 纯净食品药品法》 （1906 年）的通过，并最终促成了美国食品药品监督管理局 （FDA）等政府机构的成立。 11 1896 年经济萧条和 20 世纪 30 年代大萧条期间，国家经历了经济萧条，也因此制定了更强有力的监管政策，旨在提高金融市场的透明度，防止垄断的形成。

A final type of policy is redistributive policy, so named because it redistributes resources in society from one group to another. That is, according to Lowi, the costs are concentrated and so are the benefits, but different groups bear the costs and enjoy the benefits. Most redistributive policies are intended to have a sort of “Robin Hood” effect; their goal is to transfer income and wealth from one group to another such that everyone enjoys at least a minimal standard of living. Typically, the wealthy and middle class pay into the federal tax base, which then funds need-based programs that support low-income individuals and families. A few examples of redistributive policies are Head Start (education), Pell Grants (higher education), Medicaid (health care), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF, income support), and food programs like the Supplementary Nutritional Aid Program (SNAP). The government also uses redistribution to incentivize specific behaviors or aid small groups of people. Pell grants to encourage college attendance and tax credits to encourage home ownership are other examples of redistribution.

[.my2]
最后一种政策类型是再分配政策 ，之所以这样命名，是因为它将社会资源从一个群体重新分配给另一个群体。也就是说，根据洛伊的说法，成本和收益都是集中的，但不同的群体承担成本并享受收益。大多数再分配政策旨在产生某种“罗宾汉”效应；其目标是将收入和财富从一个群体转移到另一个群体，从而使每个人都能享有至少最低限度的生活水平。通常，富裕阶层和中产阶级缴纳联邦税，这些税款用于资助以需求为基础的项目，以支持低收入个人和家庭。再分配政策的一些例子包括：启蒙计划（教育）、佩尔助学金（高等教育）、医疗补助（医疗保健）、贫困家庭临时援助（TANF，收入支持）以及诸如补充营养援助计划（SNAP）之类的食品项目。政府还利用再分配来激励特定行为或援助小部分人群。佩尔助学金（用于鼓励上大学）和税收抵免（用于鼓励购房）也是财富再分配的例子。
