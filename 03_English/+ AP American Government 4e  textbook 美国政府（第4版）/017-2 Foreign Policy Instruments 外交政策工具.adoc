The decisions or outputs of U.S. foreign policy vary from presidential directives about conducting drone strikes to the size of the overall foreign relations budget passed by Congress, and from presidential summits with other heads of state to U.S. views of new policies considered in the UN Security Council. In this section, we consider the outputs of foreign policy produced by the U.S. government, beginning with broadly focused decisions and then discussing more sharply focused strategies. Drawing this distinction brings some clarity to the array of different policy outcomes in foreign policy. Broadly focused decisions typically take longer to formalize, bring in more actors in the United States and abroad, require more resources to carry out, are harder to reverse, and hence tend to have a lasting impact. Sharply focused outputs tend to be processed quickly, are often unilateral moves by the president, have a shorter time horizon, are easier for subsequent decision-makers to reverse, and hence do not usually have so lasting an impact as broadly focused foreign policy outputs.

美国外交政策的决策或成果多种多样，从总统关于无人机袭击的指令到国会通过的外交关系预算总额，从总统与其他国家元首的峰会到美国对联合国安理会审议的新政策的看法，不一而足。本节将探讨美国政府的外交政策成果，首先从范围广泛的决策入手，然后讨论目标更为明确的战略。这种区分有助于我们更清晰地理解外交政策中各种不同的政策结果。范围广泛的决策通常需要更长的正式制定时间，涉及美国国内外更多的参与者，需要更多的资源来执行，更难逆转，因此往往具有持久的影响。目标更为明确的成果则往往处理迅速，通常是总统的单方面行动，时间跨度较短，更容易被后续决策者推翻，因此通常不像范围广泛的外交政策成果那样具有持久的影响。

BROADLY FOCUSED FOREIGN POLICY OUTPUTS
广泛关注的外交政策产出
Broadly focused foreign policy outputs not only span multiple topics and organizations, but they also typically require large-scale spending and take longer to implement than sharply focused outputs. In the realm of broadly focused outputs, we will consider public laws, the periodic reauthorization of the foreign policy agencies, the foreign policy budget, international agreements, and the appointment process for new executive officials and ambassadors.

[.my2]
涵盖面广的外交政策成果不仅涉及多个议题和机构，而且通常需要大规模的资金投入，实施时间也比目标明确的成果更长。在涵盖面广的成果领域，我们将考察公共法律、外交政策机构的定期授权、外交政策预算、国际协定以及新任行政官员和大使的任命程序。

Public Laws  公共法律
When we talk about new laws enacted by Congress and the president, we are referring to public laws. Public laws, sometimes called statutes, are policies that affect more than a single individual. All policies enacted by Congress and the president are public laws, except for a few dozen each year. They differ from private laws, which require some sort of action or payment by a specific individual or individuals named in the law.

[.my2]
当我们谈论国会和总统颁布的新法律时，我们指的是公法 。 公法， 有时也称为法令，是指影响多个个人的政策。除每年几十项例外，国会和总统颁布的所有政策都是公法。它们与私法不同，私法要求法律中指定的特定个人或群体采取某种行动或支付某种款项。

Many statutes affect what the government can do in the foreign policy realm, including the National Security Act, the Patriot Act, the Homeland Security Act, and the War Powers Resolution. The National Security Act governs the way the government shares and stores information, while the Patriot Act (passed immediately after 9/11) clarifies what the government may do in collecting information about people in the name of protecting the country. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 authorized the creation of a massive new federal agency, the Department of Homeland Security, consolidating powers that had been under the jurisdiction of several different agencies. Their earlier lack of coordination may have prevented the United States from recognizing warning signs of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

[.my2]
许多法规影响着政府在外交政策领域的行动，其中包括《 国家安全法》 、《 爱国者法》 、《 国土安全法》 和《 战争权力决议》 。《国家安全法》规范了政府共享和存储信息的方式，而《爱国者法》（在 9/11 事件后立即通过）则明确了政府以保护国家为名收集个人信息的权限。2002 年的《国土安全法》授权成立了一个庞大的联邦机构——国土安全部，整合了此前分散在多个不同机构的权力。这些机构此前缺乏协调，可能导致美国未能及时识别出 9/11 恐怖袭击的预警信号。

The War Powers Resolution was passed in 1973 by a congressional override of President Richard Nixon’s veto. The bill was Congress’s attempt to reassert itself in war-making. Congress has the power to declare war, but it had not formally done so since Japan’s 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II. Yet the United States had entered several wars since that time, including in Korea, in Vietnam, and in focused military campaigns such as the failed 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba. The War Powers Resolution created a new series of steps to be followed by presidents in waging military conflict with other countries.

[.my2]
《战争权力决议》于1973年获得国会通过，推翻了尼克松总统的否决。该法案是国会试图重新确立其在战争事务中的权力。国会拥有宣战权，但自1941年日本偷袭珍珠港将美国拖入第二次世界大战以来，国会一直没有正式行使过这项权力。然而，此后美国卷入了数场战争，包括朝鲜战争、越南战争以及一些针对特定国家的军事行动，例如1961年入侵古巴的失败行动——猪湾入侵。《战争权力决议》为总统在与其他国家发生军事冲突时制定了一系列新的程序。

Its main feature was a requirement that presidents get approval from Congress to continue any military campaign beyond sixty days. To many, however, the overall effect was actually to strengthen the role of the president in war-making. After all, the law clarified that presidents could act on their own for sixty days before getting authorization from Congress to continue, and many smaller-scale conflicts are over within sixty days. Before the War Powers Resolution, the first approval for war was supposed to come from Congress. In theory, Congress, with its constitutional war powers, could act to reverse the actions of a president once the sixty days have passed. However, a clear disagreement between Congress and the president, especially once an initiative has begun and there is a “rally around the flag” effect, is relatively rare. More likely are tough questions about the campaign to which continuing congressional funding is tied.

[.my2]
该法案的主要特点是规定总统若要将任何军事行动延续超过六十天，必须获得国会的批准。然而，在许多人看来，其总体效果实际上加强了总统在发动战争中的作用。毕竟，该法案明确规定，总统在获得国会授权继续作战之前，可以自行采取行动六十天，而许多小规模冲突在六十天内就会结束。在《战争权力决议》出台之前，发动战争的首要批准权应归于国会。理论上，国会凭借其宪法赋予的战争权力，可以在六十天期限过后采取行动，推翻总统的行动。然而，国会与总统之间出现明显的分歧，尤其是在一项行动已经启动并形成“团结在国旗周围”效应之后，这种情况相对罕见。更常见的情况是，国会就与持续拨款挂钩的军事行动提出尖锐的问题。

Reauthorization  重新授权
All federal agencies, including those dedicated to foreign policy, face reauthorization every three to five years. If not reauthorized, agencies lose their legal standing and the ability to spend federal funds to carry out programs. Agencies typically are reauthorized, because they coordinate carefully with presidential and congressional staff to get their affairs in order when the time comes. However, the reauthorization requirements do create a regular conversation between the agency and its political principals about how well it is functioning and what could be improved.

[.my2]
所有联邦机构，包括负责外交政策的机构，每三到五年都要接受重新授权 。如果未获得重新授权，这些机构将失去法律地位，也无法动用联邦资金开展项目。通常情况下，这些机构都能获得重新授权，因为它们会与总统和国会工作人员密切协调，以便在需要时做好各项准备工作。然而，重新授权的要求也促使机构与其政治领导人之间就机构的运作情况以及需要改进的地方进行定期对话。

The federal budget process is an important annual tradition that affects all areas of foreign policy. The foreign policy and defense budgets are part of the discretionary budget, or the section of the national budget that Congress vets and decides on each year. Foreign policy leaders in the executive and legislative branches must advocate for funding from this budget, and while foreign policy budgets are usually renewed, there are enough proposed changes each year to make things interesting. In addition to new agencies, new cross-national projects are proposed each year to add to infrastructure and increase or improve foreign aid, intelligence, and national security technology.

[.my2]
联邦预算流程是一项重要的年度传统，它影响着外交政策的方方面面。外交政策和国防预算属于可自由支配预算，即国会每年审查和决定的国家预算部分。行政和立法部门的外交政策领导人必须争取从该预算中获得资金。虽然外交政策预算通常会续期，但每年都有足够多的变更提案，使得情况变得复杂。除了设立新的机构外，每年还会提出新的跨国项目，以扩充基础设施，并增加或改进对外援助、情报和国家安全技术。

Agreements  协议
International agreements represent another of the broad-based foreign policy instruments. The United States finds it useful to enter into international agreements with other countries for a variety of reasons and on a variety of different subjects. These agreements run the gamut from bilateral agreements about tariffs to multinational agreements among dozens of countries about the treatment of prisoners of war. One recent multinational pact was the seven-country Iran Nuclear Agreement in 2015, intended to limit nuclear development in Iran in exchange for the lifting of long-standing economic sanctions on that country (Figure 17.7).

[.my2]
国际协议是另一项基础广泛的外交政策工具。美国出于各种原因，在各种不同议题上与其他国家达成国际协议 ，认为这十分有益。这些协议涵盖范围广泛，从双边关税协议到数十个国家之间关于战俘待遇的多边协议，无所不包。最近的一项多边协议是 2015 年七国签署的《伊朗核协议》，该协议旨在限制伊朗的核发展，以换取解除对伊朗的长期经济制裁（ 图 17.7 ）。

The format that an international agreement takes has been the point of considerable discussion in recent years. The U.S. Constitution outlines the treaty process in Article II. The president negotiates a treaty, the Senate consents to the treaty by a two-thirds vote, and finally the president ratifies it. Despite that constitutional clarity, today over 90 percent of the international agreements into which the United States enters are not treaties but rather executive agreements.8 Executive agreements are negotiated by the president, and in the case of sole executive agreements, they are simultaneously approved by the president as well. On the other hand, congressional-executive agreements, like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), are negotiated by the president and then approved by a simple majority of the House and Senate (rather than a two-thirds vote in the Senate as is the case for a treaty). In the key case of United States v. Pink (1942), the Supreme Court ruled that executive agreements were legally equivalent to treaties provided they did not alter federal law.9 Most executive agreements are not of major importance and do not spark controversy, while some, like the Iran Nuclear Agreement, generate considerable debate. Many in the Senate thought the Iran deal should have been completed as a treaty rather than as a sole executive agreement.

[.my2]
近年来，国际协议的形式一直是人们热议的话题。美国宪法第二条规定了条约程序：总统谈判条约，参议院以三分之二多数票通过，最后由总统批准。尽管宪法对此有明确规定，但如今美国签署的国际协议中，超过 90%并非条约，而是行政协议。行政协议由总统谈判，如果是纯粹的行政协议 ， 则需同时获得总统批准。 另一方面 ， 国会与行政部门达成的协议 ， 例如《 北美自由贸易协定》（NAFTA），由总统谈判，然后由众议院和参议院以简单多数票批准（而非像条约那样需要参议院三分之二多数票）。在具有里程碑意义的“美国诉平克案” （ 1942 年）中，最高法院裁定，只要不改变联邦法律，行政协议在法律上与条约具有同等效力。 9 大多数行政协议并不重要，也不会引发争议，但有些协议，例如伊朗核协议，却引发了相当大的争论。参议院许多人认为，伊朗核协议应该以条约的形式达成，而不是仅仅作为一项行政协议。

Finding a Middle Ground
寻找折衷方案
Treaty or Executive Agreement?
条约还是行政协议？
Should new international agreements into which the United States enters be forged through the Article II treaty process of the U.S. Constitution, or through executive agreements? This question arose again in 2015 as the Iran Nuclear Agreement was being completed. That pact required Iran to halt further nuclear development and agree to nuclear inspections, while the United States and five other signatories lifted long-standing economic sanctions on Iran. The debate over whether the United States should have entered the agreement and whether it should have been a treaty rather than an executive agreement was conducted in the news media and on political comedy shows like The Daily Show.

[.my2]
美国加入的新国际协议，应该通过美国宪法第二条规定的条约程序缔结，还是通过行政命令签署？2015 年，随着伊朗核协议的最终达成，这个问题再次浮出水面。该协议要求伊朗停止进一步的核发展并同意接受核查，而美国和其他五个签署国则解除了对伊朗的长期经济制裁。关于美国是否应该加入该协议，以及该协议是否应该以条约而非行政命令的形式签署的辩论，在新闻媒体和 《每日秀》 等政治喜剧节目中引发了热议。

Your view on the form of the pact will depend on how you see executive agreements being employed. Do presidents use them to circumvent the Senate (as the “evasion hypothesis” suggests)? Or are they an efficient tool that saves the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations the work of processing hundreds of agreements each year?
你对这种协议形式的看法取决于你如何看待行政协议的运用。总统是否利用行政协议绕过参议院（正如“规避假设”所暗示的那样）？或者，行政协议是否是一种高效的工具，能够为参议院外交关系委员会节省每年处理数百份协议的工作量？

Politicians’ opinions about the form of the Iran Nuclear Agreement fell along party lines. Democrats accepted the president’s decision to use an executive agreement to finalize the pact, which they tended to support. Republicans, who were overwhelmingly against the pact, favored the use of the treaty process, which would have allowed them to vote the deal down. In the end, the president used an executive agreement and the pact was enacted. The downside is that an executive agreement can be reversed by the next president. Treaties are much more difficult to undo because they require a new process to be undertaken in the Senate in order for the president to gain approval.

[.my2]
政界人士对伊朗核协议形式的看法存在明显的党派分歧。民主党人接受了总统以行政命令最终敲定该协议的决定，他们也倾向于支持这一做法。而绝大多数反对该协议的共和党人则倾向于采用条约程序，这样他们就可以投票否决该协议。最终，总统还是使用了行政命令，协议得以生效。但行政命令的弊端在于，下一任总统可以推翻它。条约则更难被撤销，因为总统需要通过参议院的重新审议程序才能获得批准。

Which approach do you favor for the Iran Nuclear Agreement, an executive agreement or a treaty? Why?
对于伊朗核协议，您更倾向于哪种方式，行政协议还是条约？为什么？

Appointments  预约
The last broad type of foreign policy output consists of the foreign policy appointments made when a new president takes office. Typically, when the party in the White House changes, more new appointments are made than when the party does not change, because the incoming president wants to put in place people who share the president's agenda. This has been the case in every presidential transition since 1993, when Republican George H.W. Bush left office and Democrat Bill Clinton took over. The pattern continued in 2001 when Republican George W. Bush became president, and then again with Democrat Barack Obama, Republican Donald Trump, and Democrat Joe Biden.

[.my2]
外交政策产出的最后一大类是新总统就职时任命的外交政策官员 。通常情况下，当白宫执政党更迭时，新任命的官员数量会比执政党不变时更多，因为新任总统希望安插与自己理念相符的人。自 1993 年共和党人乔治·H·W·布什卸任、民主党人比尔·克林顿接任以来，历届总统更迭都遵循了这一规律。2001 年，共和党人乔治·W·布什就任总统，此后，民主党人巴拉克·奥巴马、共和党人唐纳德·特朗普和民主党人乔·拜登的就职也都遵循了这一模式。

Most foreign policy–related appointments, such as secretary of state and the various undersecretaries and assistant secretaries, as well as all ambassadors, must be confirmed by a majority vote of the Senate (Figure 17.8). Presidents seek to nominate people who know the area to which they’re being appointed and who will be loyal to the president rather than to the bureaucracy in which they might work. They also want their nominees to be readily confirmed. As we will see in more detail later in the chapter, an isolationist group of appointees will run the country’s foreign policy agencies very differently than a group that is more internationalist in its outlook. Isolationists might seek to pull back from foreign policy involvement around the globe, while internationalists would go in the other direction, toward more involvement and toward acting in conjunction with other countries.

[.my2]
大多数与外交政策相关的任命，例如国务卿、各级副国务卿和助理国务卿，以及所有大使，都必须经参议院多数票确认（ 图 17.8 ）。总统力求提名那些了解其任命领域、并且忠于总统而非其可能任职的官僚机构的人选。他们也希望提名人选能够顺利获得确认。正如我们将在本章后面详细讨论的那样，奉行孤立主义的任命团队与秉持国际主义理念的团队在管理国家外交政策机构方面将截然不同。孤立主义者可能会寻求减少在全球外交政策方面的参与，而国际主义者则会采取相反的做法，即更多地参与其中，并与其他国家合作。

Bush, was also unanimously confirmed. Condoleezza Rice (c) had a more difficult road, earning thirteen votes against, at the time the most for any secretary of state nominee since Henry Clay in 1825. According to Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), senators wanted “to hold Dr. Rice and the Bush administration accountable for their failures in Iraq and in the war on terrorism.”

SHARPLY FOCUSED FOREIGN POLICY OUTPUTS
重点突出的外交政策产出
In addition to the broad-based foreign policy outputs above, which are president-led with some involvement from Congress, many other decisions need to be made. These sharply focused foreign policy outputs tend to be exclusively the province of the president, including the deployment of troops and/or intelligence agents in a crisis, executive summits between the president and other heads of state on targeted matters of foreign policy, presidential use of military force, and emergency funding measures to deal with foreign policy crises. These measures of foreign policy are more quickly enacted and demonstrate the “energy and dispatch” that Alexander Hamilton, writing in the Federalist Papers, saw as inherent in the institution of the presidency. Emergency spending does involve Congress through its power of the purse, but Congress tends to give presidents what they need to deal with emergencies. That said, the framers were consistent in wanting checks and balances sprinkled throughout the Constitution, including in the area of foreign policy and war powers. Hence, Congress has several roles, as discussed at points throughout this chapter.

[.my2]
除了上述由总统主导、国会参与的广泛外交政策之外，还有许多其他决策需要做出。这些重点突出、目标明确的外交政策往往完全由总统行使，包括在危机中部署军队和/或情报人员、总统与其他国家元首就特定外交政策问题举行会晤、总统动用武力以及采取紧急拨款措施应对外交危机。这些外交政策措施的实施速度更快，体现了亚历山大 ·汉密尔顿在《 联邦党人文集》 中所描述的总统制固有的“活力和效率”。紧急支出确实需要国会通过其财政拨款权参与，但国会通常会给予总统应对紧急情况所需的资金。尽管如此，宪法的制定者始终坚持在宪法中贯彻权力制衡原则，包括在外交政策和战争权力领域。因此，正如本章后续章节所述，国会扮演着多种角色。

Perhaps the most famous foreign policy emergency was the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. With the Soviet Union placing nuclear missiles in Cuba, just a few hundred miles from Florida, a Cold War standoff with the United States escalated. The Soviets at first denied the existence of the missiles, but U.S. reconnaissance flights proved they were there, gathering photographic evidence that was presented at the UN (Figure 17.9). The Soviets stood firm, and U.S. foreign policy leaders debated their approach. Some in the military were pushing for aggressive action to take out the missiles and the installation in Cuba, while State Department officials favored a diplomatic route. President John F. Kennedy ended up taking the recommendation of a special committee, and the United States implemented a naval blockade of Cuba that subtly forced the Soviets’ hands. The Soviets agreed to remove their Cuban missiles and the United States in turn agreed six months later to remove its missiles from Turkey.

[.my2]
或许最著名的外交政策危机莫过于 1962 年的古巴导弹危机。 苏联在距离佛罗里达仅数百英里的古巴部署了核导弹，导致美苏冷战局势升级。苏联起初否认导弹的存在，但美国的侦察飞行证实了导弹的存在，并收集了照片证据，提交给了联合国（ 图 17.9 ）。苏联态度坚决，美国外交政策领导人就应对策略展开辩论。一些军方人士力主采取强硬行动，摧毁古巴的导弹和导弹部署设施，而国务院官员则倾向于走外交途径。最终，约翰·F·肯尼迪总统采纳了一个特别委员会的建议，美国对古巴实施了海上封锁，巧妙地迫使苏联让步。苏联同意撤走部署在古巴的导弹，而美国则在六个月后同意从土耳其撤走导弹。

Another form of focused foreign policy output is the presidential summit. Often held at the Presidential Retreat at Camp David, Maryland, these meetings bring together the president and one or more other heads of state. Presidents use these types of summits when they and their visitors need to dive deeply into important issues that are not quickly solved. An example is the 1978 summit that led to the Camp David Accords, in which President Jimmy Carter, Egyptian president Anwar El Sadat, and Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin met privately for twelve days at Camp David negotiating a peace process for the two countries, which had been at odds with each other in the Middle East. Another example is the Malta Summit between President George H. W. Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, which took place on the island of Malta over two days in December 1989 (Figure 17.10). The meetings were an important symbol of the end of the Cold War, the Berlin Wall having come down just a few months earlier.

[.my2]
另一种重点外交政策产出形式是总统峰会 。这类会议通常在位于马里兰州戴维营的总统度假地举行，总统会与一位或多位其他国家元首齐聚一堂。当总统及其来宾需要深入探讨一些难以迅速解决的重要问题时，总统就会召开这类峰会。例如，1978 年的戴维营峰会促成了《戴维营协议》的签署。当时，美国总统吉米·卡特、埃及总统安瓦尔·萨达特和以色列总理梅纳赫姆·贝京在戴维营进行了为期十二天的秘密会晤，就两国在中东的和平进程进行谈判。另一个例子是 1989 年 12 月在马耳他岛举行的马耳他峰会，美国总统乔治·H·W·布什和苏联领导人米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫出席了此次峰会（ 图 17.10 ）。由于柏林墙在几个月前刚刚倒塌，此次峰会成为冷战结束的重要象征。

Another focused foreign policy output is the military use of force. Since the 1941 Pearl Harbor attacks and the immediate declaration of war by Congress that resulted, all such initial uses of force have been authorized by the president. Congress in many cases has subsequently supported additional military action, but the president has been the instigator. While there has sometimes been criticism, Congress has never acted to reverse presidential action. As discussed above, the War Powers Resolution clarified that the first step in the use of force was the president’s, for the first sixty days. A recent example of the military use of force was the U.S. role in enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya in 2011, which included kinetic strikes—or active engagement of the enemy—to protect anti-government forces on the ground. U.S. fighter jets flew out of Aviano Air Base in northern Italy (Figure 17.11).

[.my2]
另一项重点外交政策成果是武力使用 。自 1941 年珍珠港事件以及国会随即宣战以来，所有此类首次武力使用均由总统授权。在许多情况下，国会随后支持了进一步的军事行动，但总统始终是行动的发起者。尽管有时会受到批评，但国会从未采取行动推翻总统的决定。如上所述，《 战争权力决议》 明确规定，在最初的六十天内，武力使用的第一步由总统决定。近期武力使用的一个例子是，美国在 2011 年参与了利比亚禁飞区的行动，其中包括对敌方进行动能打击——即主动交战——以保护地面上的反政府武装。美国战斗机从意大利北部的阿维亚诺空军基地起飞（ 图 17.11 ）。

The final example of a focused foreign policy input is the passage of an emergency funding measure for a specific national security task. Congress tends to pass at least one emergency spending measure per year, which must be signed by the president to take effect, and it often provides funding for domestic disasters. However, at times foreign policy matters drive an emergency spending measure, as was the case right after the 9/11 attacks. In such a case, the president or the administration proposes particular amounts for emergency foreign policy plans.

[.my2]
最后一个例子是，通过一项针对特定国家安全任务的紧急拨款法案，这体现了外交政策的重点投入。国会通常每年至少通过一项紧急支出法案，该法案必须经总统签署才能生效，其资金通常用于应对国内灾害。然而，有时外交政策问题也会推动紧急支出法案的出台，例如 9·11 事件之后的情况。在这种情况下，总统或政府会提议为紧急外交政策计划拨款特定金额。
