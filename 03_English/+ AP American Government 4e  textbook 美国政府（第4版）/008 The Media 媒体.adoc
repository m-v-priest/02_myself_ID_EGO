== 释义


The White House is covered by hundreds of media outlets from around the country and globe. Balancing access, press freedom, and each administration's desire to convey its message most positively can be a challenge and introduce tension. Everything from security to the physical size of White House rooms can dictate how many correspondents or reporters are present for a given announcement, speech, press conference, or event.

白宫受到来自全国乃至全球数百家媒体的关注。如何在媒体获取渠道、新闻自由以及历届政府力求以最佳形象传达信息的愿望之间取得平衡，是一项挑战，也容易引发紧张局势。从安保措施到白宫房间的实际大小，所有因素都可能决定特定声明、演讲、新闻发布会或活动的记者或通讯员人数。

The White House Correspondents Association advocates for the rights and access of journalists, and must work closely with the presidential press office and other entities in Washington. While reporters and news companies manage their own access to the facility -- through applications for long-term or temporary passes -- the WHCA for years managed aspects such as seating in the White House briefing room, and also manages rotating participation in the "pool" -- a subset of the White House journalists who may travel with the President or other officials, as well as attend events with limited space. In 2025, the role of the WHCA was diminished as the White House took control of pool access and barred a category of news organizations -- wire services such as Associated Press, Bloomberg, and Reuters -- from participating in the pool.1, 2
白宫记者协会致力于维护记者的权利和采访权限，必须与总统新闻办公室和华盛顿的其他机构密切合作。虽然记者和新闻机构通过申请长期或临时通行证自行管理进入白宫的权限，但多年来，白宫记者协会一直负责管理诸如白宫新闻发布室座位安排等事务，并负责轮流参与“记者池”——即可以随总统或其他官员出行，以及参加空间有限的活动的白宫记者。2025 年，随着白宫接管记者池的访问权限，并禁止美联社、彭博社和路透社等通讯社参与记者池，白宫记者协会的作用有所削弱。 1,2

Freedom of the press and an independent media are important dimensions of a liberal society and a necessary part of a healthy democracy. “No government ought to be without censors,” said Thomas Jefferson, “and where the press is free, no one ever will.”3 What does it mean to have a free news media? What regulations limit what media can do? How do the media contribute to informing citizens and monitoring politicians and the government, and how do we measure their impact? This chapter explores these and other questions about the role of the media in the United States.

新闻自由和媒体独立是自由社会的重要组成部分，也是健康民主制度的必要组成部分。“任何政府都不应该没有审查员，”托马斯·杰斐逊曾说，“而新闻自由的地方，就永远不会有审查员。” ³ 那么，拥有自由的新闻媒体意味着什么？哪些法规限制了媒体的运作？媒体如何帮助公民了解信息、监督政治家和政府？我们又该如何衡量媒体的影响？本章将探讨这些以及其他与美国媒体角色相关的问题。
