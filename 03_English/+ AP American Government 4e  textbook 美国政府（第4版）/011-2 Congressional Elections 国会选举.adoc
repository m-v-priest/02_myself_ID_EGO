The House and Senate operate very differently, partly because their members differ in the length of their terms, as well as in their age and other characteristics. In this section, we will explore why constitutional rules affect the elections for the two types of representatives and the reason the two bodies function differently by design. We also look at campaign finance to better understand how legislators get elected and stay elected.

众议院和参议院的运作方式截然不同，部分原因是其议员的任期长短、年龄和其他特征均存在差异。在本节中，我们将探讨宪法规则如何影响两类代表的选举，以及这两个机构在设计上为何运作方式不同。我们还将研究竞选资金，以更好地了解立法者如何当选并连任。

UNDERSTANDING THE HOUSE AND SENATE
了解众议院和参议院
The U.S. Constitution is very clear about who can be elected as a member of the House or Senate. A House member must be a U.S. citizen of at least seven years’ standing and at least twenty-five years old. Senators are required to have nine years’ standing as citizens and be at least thirty years old when sworn in. Representatives serve two-year terms, whereas senators serve six-year terms. Per the Supreme Court decision in U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton (1995), there are currently no term limits for either senators or representatives, despite efforts by many states to impose them in the mid-1990s.10 House members are elected by the voters in their specific congressional districts. There are currently 435 congressional districts in the United States and thus 435 House members, and each state has a number of House districts roughly proportional to its share of the total U.S. population, with states guaranteed at least one House member. Two senators are elected by each state.

美国宪法对众议院和参议院议员的选举资格规定得非常明确。众议院议员必须是拥有至少七年美国公民身份且年满二十五周岁。参议员则需拥有至少九年美国公民身份，且宣誓就职时年满三十周岁。众议员任期两年，参议员任期六年。根据最高法院在 “美国任期限制诉桑顿案” （1995 年）中的裁决，尽管许多州在 20 世纪 90 年代中期曾试图对参议员和众议员的任期进行限制，但目前美国宪法并未对参议员和众议员的任期做出规定。众议院共有 10 名议员，由选民在其各自的国会选区选举产生。目前美国共有 435 个国会选区，因此共有 435 名众议员。每个州的众议院选区数量大致与其人口占美国总人口的比例成正比，每个州至少保证拥有一名众议员席位。每个州选举两名参议员。

The structural and other differences between the House and Senate have practical consequences for the way the two chambers function. The House of Representatives has developed a stronger and more structured leadership than the Senate. Because its members serve short, two-year terms, they must regularly answer to the demands of their constituency when they run for election or reelection. Even House members of the same party in the same state will occasionally disagree on issues because of the different interests of their specific districts. Thus, the House can be highly partisan at times.

[.my2]
众议院和参议院在结构和其他方面的差异，对两院的运作方式产生了实际影响。 众议院的领导层比参议院更加强大和结构化。由于众议院议员任期较短，仅为两年，因此他们在竞选或连任时必须定期回应选民的需求。即使是同一州同一政党的众议院议员，也会因为各自选区的利益不同而在某些问题上产生分歧。因此，众议院有时会呈现出强烈的党派色彩。

In contrast, members of the Senate are furthest from the demands and scrutiny of their constituents. Because of their longer six-year terms, they will see every member of the House face constituents multiple times before they themselves are forced to seek reelection. Originally, when a state’s two U.S. senators were appointed by the state legislature, the Senate chamber’s distance from the electorate was even greater. Also, unlike members of the House who can seek the narrower interests of their district, senators must maintain a broader appeal in order to earn a majority of the votes across their entire state. In addition, the rules of the Senate allow individual members to slow down or stop legislation they dislike. These structural differences between the two chambers create real differences in the actions of their members. The heat of popular, sometimes fleeting, demands from constituents often glows red hot in the House. The Senate has the flexibility to allow these passions to cool. Dozens of major initiatives were passed by the House and had a willing president, for example, only to be defeated in the Senate. In 2012, the Buffett Rule would have implemented a minimum tax rate of 30 percent on wealthy Americans. Sixty senators had to agree to bring it to a vote, but the bill fell short of that number and died.11 Similarly, although the ACA became widely known as “Obamacare,” the president did not send a piece of legislation to Capitol Hill; he asked Congress to write the bills. Both the House and Senate authored their own versions of the legislation. The House’s version was much bolder and larger in terms of establishing a national health care system. However, it did not stand a chance in the Senate, where a more moderate version of the legislation was introduced. In the end, House leaders saw the Senate version as preferable to doing nothing and ultimately supported it.

[.my2]
相比之下， 参议员与选民的需求和监督最为疏远。由于参议员的任期长达六年，他们会看到每位众议员在自己被迫寻求连任之前多次面对选民。最初，当一个州的两位联邦参议员由州议会任命时，参议院与选民的距离甚至更大。此外，与可以代表选区利益的众议员不同，参议员必须保持更广泛的吸引力，才能赢得全州多数选票。而且，参议院的规则允许个别议员拖延或阻止他们不喜欢的法案。两院之间的这些结构性差异，导致两院议员的行为存在显著差异。在众议院，选民的热情往往高涨，有时甚至转瞬即逝。而参议院则拥有更大的灵活性，可以允许这些热情逐渐冷却。例如，数十项重大提案在众议院获得通过，并且有一位积极支持的总统，最终却在参议院遭到否决。 2012 年，巴菲特法则曾提议对美国富人征收 30%的最低税率。该法案需要 60 名参议员同意才能进行表决，但最终因未获通过而夭折。 11 同样，尽管《平价医疗法案》（ACA）后来被广泛称为“奥巴马医改”，但奥巴马总统并未向国会提交法案草案，而是要求国会自行起草。众议院和参议院分别提出了各自的法案版本。众议院的版本在建立全国医疗保健体系方面更为大胆和全面。 然而，这项法案在参议院毫无胜算，参议院提出了一个更为温和的版本。最终，众议院领导人认为参议院的版本总比什么都不做要好，并最终予以支持。

CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN FUNDING
国会竞选资金
Modern political campaigns in the United States are expensive, and they have been growing more so. For example, in 1986, the costs of running a successful House and Senate campaign were $849,111 and $7,243,782, respectively, in 2020 dollars. By 2020, those values had shot to $2.4 million and $27.2 million (Figure 11.7).12 Raising this amount of money takes quite a bit of time and effort. Indeed, a presentation for incoming Democratic representatives suggested a daily Washington schedule of five hours reaching out to donors, while only three or four were to be used for actual congressional work. As this advice reveals, raising money for reelection constitutes a large proportion of the work a congressperson does. This has caused many to wonder whether the amount of money in politics has truly become a corrupting influence. However, overall, the lion’s share of direct campaign contributions in congressional elections comes from individual donors, who are less influential than the political action committees (PACs) that contribute the remainder.13
美国现代政治竞选成本高昂，而且成本还在不断攀升。例如，1986 年，成功竞选众议院议员和参议院议员的成本分别为 849,111 美元和 7,243,782 美元（按 2020 年美元计算）。到 2020 年，这两个数字分别飙升至 240 万美元和 2720 万美元（ 图 11.7 ）。筹集如此巨额的资金需要耗费大量的时间和精力。事实上，一份面向新任民主党众议员的演示文稿建议，他们每天要在华盛顿花费五个小时与捐款人沟通，而实际用于国会工作的时间只有三到四个小时。正如这份建议所揭示的，为连任筹款占据了国会议员工作的大部分时间。这引发了许多人的质疑：政治中的金钱是否真的已经成为一种腐蚀性的影响因素？然而，总体而言，国会选举中绝大部分的直接竞选捐款来自个人捐助者，他们的影响力远不及捐款其余部分的政治行动委员会（PAC） 。13

Nevertheless, the complex problem of funding campaigns has a long history in the United States. For nearly the first hundred years of the republic, there were no federal campaign finance laws. Then, between the late nineteenth century and the start of World War I, Congress pushed through a flurry of reforms intended to bring order to the world of campaign finance. These laws made it illegal for politicians to solicit contributions from civil service workers, made corporate contributions illegal, and required candidates to report their fundraising. As politicians and donors soon discovered, however, these laws were full of loopholes and were easily skirted by those who knew the ins and outs of the system.

[.my2]
然而，竞选资金筹措这一复杂问题在美国由来已久。在共和国成立后的近百年里，美国并没有联邦竞选资金法。随后，从19世纪末到第一次世界大战爆发前，国会通过了一系列旨在规范竞选资金的改革法案。这些法案禁止政客向公务员募捐，禁止企业捐款，并要求候选人报告其筹款情况。然而，政客和捐款人很快发现，这些法律漏洞百出，那些熟悉内情的人很容易就能钻空子。

Another handful of reform attempts were therefore pushed through in the wake of World War II, but then Congress neglected campaign finance reform for a few decades. That lull ended in the early 1970s when the Federal Election Campaign Act was passed. Among other things, it created the Federal Election Commission (FEC), required candidates to disclose where their money was coming from and where they were spending it, limited individual contributions, and provided for public financing of presidential campaigns.

[.my2]
因此，二战后又通过了一些改革尝试，但随后国会搁置了竞选资金改革数十年。这种沉寂局面在 20 世纪 70 年代初随着《 联邦竞选法》的通过而结束。该法案除其他内容外，还设立了联邦选举委员会（FEC），要求候选人披露其资金来源和用途，限制个人捐款，并规定总统竞选由公共资金资助。

Another important reform occurred in 2002, when Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Russell Feingold (D-WI) drafted, and Congress passed, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA), also referred to as the McCain-Feingold Act. The purpose of this law was to limit the use of “soft money,” which is raised for purposes like party-building efforts, get-out-the-vote efforts, and issue-advocacy ads. Unlike “hard money” contributed directly to a candidate, which is heavily regulated and limited, soft money had almost no regulations or limits. It had never been a problem before the mid-1990s, when a number of very imaginative political operatives developed a great many ways to spend this money. After that, soft-money donations skyrocketed. But the McCain-Feingold bill greatly limited this type of fundraising.

[.my2]
另一项重要的改革发生在 2002 年，当时参议员约翰·麦凯恩（亚利桑那州共和党）和拉塞尔·费恩戈尔德（威斯康星州民主党）起草了《 两党竞选改革法案》 （BCRA），该法案也被称为《 麦凯恩-费恩戈尔德法案》 ，并由国会通过。这项法案旨在限制“软钱”的使用，软钱用于诸如政党建设、选民动员和议题宣传广告等目的。与直接捐赠给候选人的“硬钱”（受到严格监管和限制）不同，软钱几乎没有任何监管或限制。在 20 世纪 90 年代中期之前，软钱从未成为问题，但当时许多极富想象力的政治掮客开发出了许多使用软钱的方法。此后，软钱捐款激增。但《麦凯恩-费恩戈尔德法案》极大地限制了这种筹款方式。

McCain-Feingold placed limits on total contributions to political parties, prohibited coordination between candidates and PAC campaigns, and required candidates to include personal endorsements on their political ads. Until 2010, it also limited advertisements run by unions and corporations thirty days before a primary and sixty days before a general election.14 The FEC’s enforcement of the law spurred numerous court cases challenging it. The most controversial decision was handed down by the Supreme Court in 2010, whose ruling on Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission led to the removal of spending limits on corporations. Justices in the majority argued that the BCRA violated a corporation’s free-speech rights.15
《麦凯恩-费恩戈尔德法案》限制了对政党的捐款总额，禁止候选人与政治行动委员会（PAC）竞选活动进行协调，并要求候选人在其政治广告中包含个人背书。该法案在 2010 年之前还限制了工会和企业在初选前 30 天和普选前 60 天投放的广告。 14 联邦选举委员会对该法案的执行引发了大量挑战其合法性的诉讼。其中最具争议的判决是最高法院在 2010 年就 “公民联合诉联邦选举委员会案”（Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission） 作出的裁决，该裁决取消了对企业支出的限制。多数派大法官认为，《两党竞选改革法案》（BCRA）侵犯了企业的言论自由权。 15

The Citizens United case began as a lawsuit against the FEC filed by Citizens United, a nonprofit organization that wanted to advertise a documentary critical of former senator and Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton on the eve of the 2008 Democratic primaries. Advertising or showing the film during this time window was prohibited by the McCain-Feingold Act. But the Court found that this type of restriction violated the organization’s First Amendment right to free speech. As critics of the decision predicted at the time, the Court thus opened the floodgates to private soft money flowing into campaigns again.

[.my2]
“公民联合会诉联邦选举委员会案”源于“公民联合会”组织对联邦选举委员会提起的诉讼。该非营利组织希望在 2008 年民主党总统初选前夕宣传一部批评前参议员、民主党候选人希拉里·克林顿的纪录片。根据《麦凯恩-费恩戈尔德法案》，在此期间宣传或放映该影片是被禁止的。但最高法院裁定，这种限制侵犯了该组织受美国宪法第一修正案保护的言论自由权。正如当时批评人士所预言的那样，最高法院的这一裁决再次打开了私人软钱涌入竞选活动的闸门。

In the wake of the Citizens United decision, a new type of advocacy group emerged, the super PAC. A traditional PAC is an organization designed to raise hard money to elect or defeat candidates. Such PACs tended to be run by businesses and other groups, like the Teamsters Union and the National Rifle Association, to support their special interests. They are highly regulated in regard to the amount of money they can take in and spend, but super PACs aren’t bound by these regulations. While they cannot give money directly to a candidate or a candidate’s party, they can raise and spend unlimited funds, and they can spend independently of a campaign or party. In the 2020 election cycle, for example, super PACs spent just over $2 billion dollars and raised about $1.3 billion more.16
在 “公民联合会诉联邦选举委员会案”（Citizens United v. FEC）判决之后，一种新型的倡导团体——超级政治行动委员会（Super PAC） 应运而生。传统的政治行动委员会（PAC） 是指旨在筹集资金以支持或反对候选人的组织。这类 PAC 通常由企业和其他团体运营，例如卡车司机工会（Teamsters Union）和全国步枪协会（NRA），以支持其特殊利益。它们在资金的筹集和支出方面受到严格监管，但超级政治行动委员会不受这些规定的约束。虽然它们不能直接向候选人或候选人所在的政党捐款，但它们可以筹集和支出无限额的资金，并且可以独立于竞选活动或政党进行支出。例如，在 2020 年大选周期中，超级政治行动委员会的支出略高于 20 亿美元，并筹集了约 13 亿美元。 16

At the same time, several limits on campaign contributions have been upheld by the courts and remain in place. Individuals may contribute up to $2900 per candidate per election. Individuals may also give $5000 to PACs and $36,500 to a national party committee. PACs that contribute to more than one candidate are permitted to contribute $5000 per candidate per election, and up to $15,000 to a national party. PACs created to give money to only one candidate are limited to only $2900 per candidate, however (Figure 11.8).17 The amounts are adjusted every two years, based on inflation. These limits are intended to create a more equal playing field for the candidates, so that candidates must raise their campaign funds from a broad pool of contributors.

[.my2]
与此同时，法院维持了多项竞选捐款限额，这些限额仍然有效。个人每次选举最多可向每位候选人捐款 2900 美元。个人还可以向政治行动委员会（PAC）捐款 5000 美元，向全国性政党委员会捐款 36500 美元。向多位候选人捐款的 PAC 每次选举最多可向每位候选人捐款 5000 美元，向全国性政党捐款最多可捐款 15000 美元。然而，专门为一位候选人捐款的 PAC，每次选举最多只能向每位候选人捐款 2900 美元（ 图 11.8 ）。 17 这些限额每两年根据通货膨胀率进行调整。这些限制旨在为候选人创造一个更加公平的竞争环境，迫使候选人必须从广泛的捐款者群体中筹集竞选资金。

Under the column “Candidate Committee” are the values “Individual: $2,900* per election”, “Candidate Committee: $2,000 per election”, “PAC-multicandidate: $5,000 per election”, “PAC-Nonmulticandidate: $2,900 per election, “State/District/Local Party Committee: $5,000 per election (combined)”, and “National Party Committee: $5,000 per election (3)”. Under the column “PAC (1) (SSF and Nonconnected)” are the values “Individual: $5,000 per year”, “Candidate Committee: $5,000 per year”, “PAC-multicandidate: $5,000 per year”, “PAC-Nonmulticandidate: $5,000 per year”, “State/District/Local Party Committee: $5,000 per election (combined)”, and “National Party Committee: $5,000 per year”. Under the column “State/District/Local Party Committee” are the values “Individual: $10,000 per year (combined)”, “Candidate Committee: Unlimited Transfers”, “PAC-multicandidate: $5,000 per year (combined)”, “PAC-Nonmulticandidate: $10,000 per year (combined)”, “State/District/Local Party Committee: Unlimited Transfers”, and “National Party Committee: Unlimited Transfers”. Under the column “National Party Committee” are the values “Individual: $36,500* per year”, “Candidate Committee: Unlimited Transfers”, “PAC-multicandidate: $15,000 per year”, “PAC-Nonmulticandidate: $36,500* per year”, “State/District/Local Party Committee: Unlimited Transfers”, and “National Party Committee: Unlimited Transfers”. Under the column “Additional National party Committee Accounts (2)” are the values “Individual: $109,500* per account, per year”, “PAC-Multicandidate: $45,000 per account, per year”, and “PAC-Nonmulticandidate: $109,500* per account per year”. At the bottom of the table the following footnotes are listed: *Indexed for inflation in odd-numbered years. (1) “PAC” here refers to a committee that makes contributions to other federal political committees. Independent-expenditure-only political committees (sometimes called “super PACs”) may accept unlimited contributions, including from corporations and labor organizations. (2) The limits in this column apply to a national party committee’s accounts for: (i) the presidential nominating convention; (ii) election recounts and contests and other legal proceedings; and (iii) national party headquarters buildings. A party’s national committee, Senate campaign committee and House campaign committee are each considered separate national party committees with separate limits. Only a national party committee, not the parties’ national congressional campaign committees, may have an account for the presidential nominating convention. (3) Additionally, a national party committee and its Senatorial campaign committee may contribute up to $51,200 combined per campaign to each Senate candidate. At the bottom of the table, a source is listed: “Federal Election Commission. “Contribution Limits for 2021-2022 Federal Elections.” June, 2021”.

INCUMBENCY EFFECTS  现任优势效应
Not surprisingly, the jungle of campaign financing regulations and loopholes is more easily navigated by incumbents in Congress than by newcomers. Incumbents are elected officials who currently hold an office. The amount of money they raise against their challengers demonstrates their advantage. In 2020, for example, the average Senate incumbent raised $28,649,593, whereas the average challenger raised only $5,264,022.18 This is one of the many reasons incumbents win a large majority of congressional races each electoral cycle. Incumbents attract more money because people want to give to a winner. In the House, the percentage of incumbents winning reelection has hovered between 85 and 100 percent for the last half century. In the Senate, there is only slightly more variation, given the statewide nature of the race, but it is still a very high majority of incumbents who win reelection (Figure 11.9). As these rates show, even in the worst political environments, incumbents are very difficult to defeat.

[.my2]
不出所料，国会现任议员比新人更容易驾驭竞选资金监管和漏洞重重的规则。现任议员是指目前担任公职的民选官员。他们筹集的资金数额远超挑战者，这体现了他们的优势。例如，2020 年，参议院现任议员平均筹集了 28,649,593 美元，而挑战者平均仅筹集了 5,264,022 美元。 18 这也是现任议员在每个选举周期都能赢得绝大多数国会席位的众多原因之一。现任议员更容易吸引资金，因为人们更愿意支持获胜者。在过去半个世纪里，众议院现任议员的连任率一直徘徊在 85%到 100%之间。鉴于参议院选举的全州性质，其连任率的波动幅度略大，但现任议员的连任率仍然非常高（ 图 11.9 ）。从这些比率可以看出，即使在最糟糕的政治环境下，现任者也很难被击败。

The historical difficulty of unseating an incumbent in the House or Senate is often referred to as the incumbent advantage or the incumbency effect. The advantage in financing is a huge part of this effect, but it is not the only important part. Incumbents often have a much higher level of name recognition. All things being equal, voters are far more likely to select the name of the person they recall seeing on television and hearing on the radio for the last few years than the name of a person they hardly know. And donors are more likely to want to give to a proven winner.

[.my2]
历史上，在众议院或参议院中，击败现任议员的难度通常被称为“ 现任优势” 或 “现任效应” 。资金优势是造成这种效应的重要因素，但并非唯一因素。现任议员往往拥有更高的知名度。在其他条件相同的情况下，选民更有可能选择过去几年在电视和广播中经常看到或听到的人，而不是一个他们几乎不认识的人。而捐赠者也更倾向于资助一位已经证明自己是赢家的人。

But more important is the way the party system itself privileges incumbents. A large percentage of congressional districts across the country are “safe seats” in uncompetitive districts, meaning candidates from a particular party are highly likely to consistently win the seat. This means the functional decision in these elections occurs during the primary, not in the general election. Political parties in general prefer to support incumbents in elections, because the general consensus is that incumbents are better candidates, and their record of success lends support to this conclusion. That said, while the political parties themselves to a degree control and regulate the primaries, popular individual candidates and challengers sometimes rule the day. This has especially been the case in recent years as conservative incumbents have been “primaried” by challengers more conservative than they.

[.my2]
但更重要的是，政党制度本身就赋予了现任者特权。全国很大一部分国会选区都是竞争不激烈的“安全席位”，这意味着特定政党的候选人极有可能持续赢得该席位。因此，这些选举的实际决定是在初选中做出的，而不是在普选中。政党通常更倾向于支持现任者，因为普遍认为现任者是更优秀的候选人，而他们过往的成功记录也印证了这一点。尽管政党在一定程度上控制和规范着初选，但受欢迎的候选人和挑战者有时也能左右选举结果。近年来，这种情况尤为突出，一些保守派现任者在初选中被比他们更保守的挑战者击败。

The End of Incumbency Advantage?
现任优势的终结？
At the start of 2014, House majority whip Eric Cantor, a representative from Virginia, was at the top of his game. He was handsome, popular with talk show hosts and powerful insiders, an impressive campaign fundraiser and speaker, and apparently destined to become Speaker of the House when the current speaker stepped down. Four months later, Cantor lost the opportunity to run for his own congressional seat in a shocking primary election upset that shook the Washington political establishment to its core.

2014年初，弗吉尼亚州众议员、众议院多数党党鞭埃里克·坎托正值事业巅峰。他英俊潇洒，深受脱口秀主持人及政界要人的喜爱，筹款能力和演讲才能都令人瞩目，似乎注定会在现任议长卸任后接任。然而四个月后，坎托在一场震惊华盛顿政坛的初选中落败，失去了竞选连任的机会。这场初选的意外结果震动了整个华盛顿政坛。

What happened? How did such a powerful incumbent lose a game in which the cards had been stacked so heavily in his favor? Analyses of the stunning defeat quickly showed there were more chinks in Cantor’s polished armor than most wanted to admit. But his weakness wasn’t that he was unable to play the political game. Rather, he may have learned to play it too well. He became seen as too much of a Washington insider.

究竟发生了什么？这样一位权势滔天的现任官员，为何会在胜算如此巨大的局面下败北？对这场令人震惊的失败的分析很快揭示出，坎托光鲜亮丽的盔甲下隐藏着比大多数人愿意承认的更多弱点。但他的弱点并非在于他不会玩弄政治游戏，而是他可能玩得太过火了。他被视为华盛顿圈内人太多了。

Cantor’s ambition, political skill, deep connections to political insiders, and ability to come out squeaky clean after even the dirtiest political tussling should have given him a clear advantage over any competitor. But in the political environment of 2014, when conservative voices around the country criticized the party for ignoring the people and catering to political insiders, his strengths became weaknesses. Indeed, Cantor was the only highest-level Republican representative sacrificed to conservative populism.

坎托的雄心壮志、政治手腕、与政界人士的深厚关系，以及即便在最肮脏的政治斗争中也能全身而退的能力，本应使他比任何竞争对手都拥有明显的优势。但在2014年的政治环境下，当全国各地的保守派人士批评共和党忽视民众、迎合政界人士时，他的优势反而变成了劣势。事实上，坎托是唯一一位为了保守民粹主义而牺牲的最高级别共和党众议员。

Were the winds of change blowing for incumbents? Between 1946 and 2012, only 5 percent of incumbent senators and 2 percent of House incumbents lost their party primaries.19 In 2014, Cantor was one of four House incumbents who did so, while no incumbent senators suffered defeat. All evidence suggests the incumbent advantage, especially in the primary system, is alive and well. The story of Eric Cantor may very well be the classic case of an exception proving the rule.

变革之风是否正吹向现任者？1946 年至 2012 年间，仅有 5%的现任参议员和 2%的现任众议员在党内初选中落败。 19 2014 年，坎托是四位落败的现任众议员之一，而没有一位现任参议员遭遇败选。所有证据都表明，现任优势，尤其是在初选制度下，依然存在且十分显著。埃里克·坎托的故事或许正是“例外证明规则”的经典案例。

If you are a challenger running against an incumbent, what are some strategies you could use to make the race competitive? Would Congress operate differently if challengers defeated incumbents more often?
如果你是一名挑战者，要与现任议员竞选，你可以采取哪些策略来增加竞争性？如果挑战者更频繁地击败现任议员，国会的运作方式会有所不同吗？

Another reason incumbents wield a great advantage over their challengers is the state power they have at their disposal.20 One of the many responsibilities of a sitting congressperson is constituent casework. Constituents routinely reach out to their congressperson for powerful support to solve complex problems, such as applying for and tracking federal benefits or resolving immigration and citizenship challenges.21 Incumbent members of Congress have paid staff, influence, and access to specialized information that can help their constituents in ways other persons cannot. And congresspersons are hardly reticent about their efforts to support their constituents. Often, they will publicize their casework on their websites or, in some cases, create television advertisements that boast of their helpfulness. Election history has demonstrated that this form of publicity is very effective in garnering the support of voters.

现任议员比挑战者拥有巨大优势的另一个原因是他们掌握着强大的州级权力。 20 现任国会议员的众多职责之一是处理选民事务 。选民经常联系他们的国会议员，寻求强有力的支持来解决复杂的问题，例如申请和追踪联邦福利，或解决移民和公民身份方面的难题。 21 现任国会议员拥有付费工作人员、影响力以及获取专业信息的渠道，这些优势能够以其他人无法做到的方式帮助选民。而且，国会议员们也从不吝于宣传他们为选民所做的努力。他们通常会在自己的网站上公布他们的工作成果，有时甚至会制作电视广告来宣传他们的服务。选举历史表明，这种宣传方式在赢得选民支持方面非常有效。

LOCAL AND NATIONAL ELECTIONS
地方和全国选举
The importance of airing positive constituent casework during campaigns is a testament to the accuracy of saying, “All politics is local.” This phrase, attributed to former Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill (D-MA), essentially means that the most important motivations directing voters are rooted in local concerns. In general, this is true. People naturally feel more driven by the things that affect them on a daily basis. These are concerns like the quality of the roads, the availability of good jobs, and the cost and quality of public education. Good senators and representatives understand this and will seek to use their influence and power in office to affect these issues for the better. This is an age-old strategy for success in office and elections.

在竞选期间宣传选民的积极案例至关重要，这印证了“一切政治皆地方政治”这句名言的正确性。这句话出自前众议院议长蒂普·奥尼尔（马萨诸塞州民主党籍），其核心含义是：选民最重要的动机源于地方事务。总的来说，这的确如此。人们自然更容易受到日常生活中切身利益的影响，例如道路质量、就业机会以及公共教育的成本和质量。优秀的参议员和众议员深谙此道，他们会利用自身的影响力和权力来改善这些问题。这是一种由来已久的制胜策略。

Political scientists have taken note of some voting patterns that appear to challenge this common assumption, however. In 1960, political scientist Angus Campbell proposed the surge-and-decline theory to explain these patterns.22 Campbell noticed that since the Civil War, with the exception of 1934, the president’s party has consistently lost seats in Congress during the midterm elections. He proposed that the reason was a surge in political stimulation during presidential elections, which contributes to greater turnout and brings in voters who are ordinarily less interested in politics. These voters, Campbell argued, tend to favor the party holding the presidency. In contrast, midterm elections witness the opposite effect. They are less stimulating and have lower turnout because less-interested voters stay home. This shift, in Campbell’s theory, provides an advantage to the party not currently occupying the presidency.

然而，政治学家们注意到一些投票模式似乎挑战了这一普遍假设。1960 年，政治学家安格斯 ·坎贝尔提出了“ 激增与衰退”理论来解释这些模式。 22 坎贝尔注意到，自南北战争以来，除 1934 年外，总统所在的政党在中期选举中总是失去国会席位。他认为，这是因为总统选举期间政治刺激激增，促使更多选民参与投票，并吸引了那些通常对政治不太感兴趣的选民。坎贝尔认为，这些选民往往倾向于支持执政党。相比之下，中期选举则呈现相反的效果。由于政治刺激较少，投票率也较低，因为那些对政治不太感兴趣的选民选择待在家中。在坎贝尔的理论中，这种转变对目前未执政的政党有利。

In the decades since Campbell’s influential theory was published, a number of studies have challenged his conclusions. Nevertheless, the pattern of midterm elections benefiting the president’s opposition has persisted.23 Only in exceptional years has this pattern been broken: first in 1998 during President Bill Clinton’s second term and the Monica Lewinsky scandal, when exit polls indicated most voters opposed the idea of impeaching the president, and then again in 2002, following the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the ensuing declaration of a “war on terror.”
自坎贝尔颇具影响力的理论发表以来的几十年里，许多研究都对他的结论提出了质疑。 然而 ，中期选举有利于总统反对派的模式依然存在。23 只有在特殊年份，这种模式才会被打破：第一次是在 1998 年，比尔·克林顿总统的第二个任期内，当时正值莫妮卡·莱温斯基丑闻爆发，出口民调显示大多数选民反对弹劾总统；第二次是在 2002 年，在 9·11 恐怖袭击事件发生后，美国宣布发动“反恐战争”。

The evidence does suggest that national concerns, rather than local ones, can function as powerful motivators at the polls. Consider, for example, the role of the Iraq War in bringing about a Democratic rout of the Republicans in the House in 2006 and in the Senate in 2008. Unlike previous wars in Europe and Vietnam, the war in Iraq was fought by a very small percentage of the population.24 The vast majority of citizens were not soldiers, few had relatives fighting in the war, and most did not know anyone who directly suffered from the prolonged conflict. Voters in large numbers were motivated by the political and economic disaster of the war to vote for politicians they believed would end it (Figure 11.10).

证据表明，国家层面的考量而非地方层面的考量，更能成为选民投票的强大动力。例如，伊拉克战争在 2006 年众议院和 2008 年参议院选举中，都促成了民主党对共和党的全面胜利。与以往的欧洲战争和越南战争不同，伊拉克战争的参战人口比例极低。 24 绝大多数公民并非军人，很少有亲属参战，而且大多数人也不认识任何直接遭受这场旷日持久冲突之苦的人。大量选民受到战争带来的政治和经济灾难的刺激，投票支持他们认为能够结束战争的政治人物（ 图 11.10 ）。

What makes the Iraq War different is that the overwhelming majority of voters had little to no intimate connection with the conflict and were motivated to vote for those who would end it.

Congressional elections may be increasingly driven by national issues. Just two decades ago, straight-ticket, party-line voting was still relatively rare across most of the country.25 In much of the South, which began to vote overwhelmingly Republican in presidential elections during the 1960s and 1970s, Democrats were still commonly elected to the House and Senate. The candidates themselves and the important local issues, apart from party affiliation, were important drivers in congressional elections. This began to change in the 1980s and 1990s, as Democratic representatives across the region began to dwindle. And the South isn’t alone; areas in the Northeast and the Northwest have grown increasingly Democratic. Indeed, the 2014 midterm election was the most nationalized election in many decades and that trend has continued since. Voters who favor a particular party in a presidential election are now much more likely to also support that same party in House and Senate elections than was the case just a few decades ago.

国会选举可能越来越受到全国性议题的影响。仅仅二十年前，在全国大部分地区，一票全投、按党派投票的情况还相对罕见。 25 在 20 世纪 60 年代和 70 年代总统选举中开始压倒性地支持共和党的南部大部分地区，民主党人仍然经常当选众议院和参议院议员。除了党派归属之外，候选人本身和重要的当地议题才是国会选举的重要驱动因素。这种情况在 20 世纪 80 年代和 90 年代开始发生变化，该地区的民主党代表人数开始减少。而且南部并非个例；东北部和西北部的一些地区也越来越倾向于民主党。事实上，2014 年的中期选举是几十年来全国性程度最高的一次选举，而且这一趋势此后一直在持续。如今，在总统选举中支持某个政党的选民，比几十年前更有可能在众议院和参议院选举中也支持同一政党。
