== 释义



The belief that people should be treated equally under the law is one of the cornerstones of political thought in the United States. Yet not all citizens have been treated equally throughout the nation’s history, and some are treated differently even today. For example, until 1920, nearly all women in the United States lacked the right to vote. Black men received the right to vote in 1870, but as late as 1940, only 3 percent of African American adults living in the South were registered to vote, due largely to laws designed to keep them from the polls.1 Americans were not allowed to enter into legal marriage with a member of the same sex in many U.S. states until 2015. Some types of unequal treatment are considered acceptable in some contexts, while others are clearly not. No one would consider it acceptable to allow a ten-year-old to vote, because a child lacks the ability to understand important political issues, but all reasonable people would agree that it is wrong to mandate racial segregation or to deny someone voting rights on the basis of race. It is important to understand which types of inequality are unacceptable and why.

在美国，法律面前人人平等的信念是政治思想的基石之一。然而，纵观美国历史，并非所有公民都享有平等的待遇，即使在今天，一些人仍然受到区别对待。例如，直到 1920 年，美国几乎所有女性都没有投票权。黑人男性在 1870 年获得了投票权，但直到 1940 年，居住在南方的非裔美国成年人中只有 3%登记投票，这主要是由于旨在阻止他们投票的法律所致。 1 直到 2015 年，美国许多州才允许同性婚姻合法化。某些类型的不平等待遇在某些情况下被认为是可接受的，而另一些则显然是不可接受的。没有人会认为允许一个十岁的孩子投票是可以接受的，因为孩子缺乏理解重要政治问题的能力，但所有理性的人都会同意，强制种族隔离或基于种族剥夺他人的投票权是错误的。了解哪些类型的不平等是不可接受的以及为什么是不可接受的，这一点很重要。

DEFINING CIVIL RIGHTS  界定公民权利
Essentially, civil rights are guarantees by the government that it will treat people equally—particularly people belonging to groups that have historically been denied the same rights and opportunities as others. The due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution enacted the Declaration of Independence's proclamation that “all men are created equal” by providing de jure equal treatment under the law. According to Chief Justice Earl Warren in the Supreme Court case of Bolling v. Sharpe (1954), “discrimination may be so unjustifiable as to be violative of due process.”2 Additional guarantees of equality were provided in 1868 by the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which states, in part, that “No State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” Thus, between the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, neither state governments nor the federal government may treat people unequally unless unequal treatment is necessary to maintain important governmental interests such as public safety.

[.my2]
本质上， 公民权利是政府保障其平等对待所有人的保障——尤其保障那些历史上被剥夺了与其他群体同等权利和机会的群体。美国宪法第五修正案的正当程序条款通过提供法律上的平等对待，落实了 《独立宣言》中“人人生而平等”的宣言。正如首席大法官厄尔· 沃伦在 1954 年最高法院审理的博林诉夏普案中所言，“歧视可能毫无正当理由，以至于违反正当程序。” 2 1868 年通过的第十四修正案的平等保护条款进一步保障了平等，该条款部分规定，“任何州……不得拒绝在其管辖范围内任何人享有法律的平等保护。” 因此，在第五修正案和第十四修正案的共同作用下，州政府和联邦政府都不得对任何人区别对待，除非这种区别对待对于维护公共安全等重要的政府利益是必要的。

We can contrast civil rights with civil liberties, which are limitations on government power designed to protect our fundamental freedoms. For example, the Eighth Amendment prohibits the application of “cruel and unusual punishments” to those convicted of crimes, a limitation on the power of members of each governmental branch: judges, law enforcement, and lawmakers. As another example, the guarantee of equal protection means the laws and the Constitution must be applied on an equal basis, limiting the government’s ability to discriminate or treat some people differently, unless the unequal treatment is based on a valid reason, such as age. A law that imprisons men twice as long as women for the same offense, or restricting people with disabilities from contacting members of Congress, would treat some people differently from others for no valid reason and would therefore be unconstitutional. According to the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause, “all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.”3 If people are not similarly circumstanced, however, they may be treated differently. Asian Americans and Latinos overstaying a visa are similarly circumstanced; however, a blind driver or a ten-year-old driver is differently circumstanced than a sighted, adult driver.

[.my2]
我们可以将公民权利与公民自由进行对比，后者是对政府权力的限制，旨在保护我们的基本自由。例如，第八修正案禁止对罪犯施以“残酷和不寻常的惩罚”，这限制了各政府部门成员（法官、执法人员和立法者）的权力。再举一例，平等保护条款意味着法律和宪法必须平等适用，限制政府歧视或区别对待某些人的能力，除非这种不平等对待基于正当理由，例如年龄。一项法律如果对犯同样罪行的男性判处两倍于女性的刑期，或者限制残疾人与国会议员联系，就会在没有任何正当理由的情况下区别对待某些人，因此违宪。根据最高法院对平等保护条款的解释，“所有情况类似的人都应受到同等对待。” ³ 然而，如果人们的情况不同，他们可能会受到区别对待。亚裔美国人和拉丁裔逾期居留的情况类似；然而，盲人驾驶员或十岁驾驶员的情况与视力正常的成年驾驶员的情况不同。

IDENTIFYING DISCRIMINATION
识别歧视
Laws that treat one group of people differently from others are not always unconstitutional. In fact, the government engages in legal discrimination quite often. In most states, you must be eighteen years old to smoke cigarettes and twenty-one to drink alcohol; these laws discriminate against the young. To get a driver’s license so you can legally drive a car on public roads, you have to be a minimum age and pass tests showing your knowledge, practical skills, and vision. Some public colleges and universities run by the government have an open admission policy, which means the school admits all who apply, but others require that students have a high school diploma or a particular score on the SAT or ACT or a GPA above a certain number. This is a kind of discrimination, because these requirements treat people who do not have a high school diploma or a high enough GPA or SAT score differently. How can the federal, state, and local governments discriminate in all these ways even though the equal protection clause seems to suggest that everyone be treated the same?
区别对待不同群体的法律并非总是违宪的。事实上，政府经常进行合法的歧视。在大多数州，吸烟必须年满十八岁，饮酒必须年满二十一岁；这些法律歧视年轻人。要获得驾照以便在公共道路上合法驾驶汽车，必须达到最低年龄并通过考试，证明其知识、实践技能和视力。一些公立学院和大学实行开放招生政策，这意味着学校录取所有申请者，但另一些则要求学生拥有高中毕业文凭、SAT 或 ACT 考试的特定分数或高于一定标准的 GPA。这是一种歧视，因为这些要求区别对待那些没有高中毕业文凭或 GPA 或 SAT 分数不够高的人。联邦、州和地方政府为何能在所有这些方面进行歧视，尽管平等保护条款似乎表明每个人都应受到平等对待？

The answer to this question lies in the purpose of the discriminatory practice. In most cases when the courts are deciding whether discrimination is unlawful, the government has to demonstrate only that it has a good reason to do so. Unless the person or group challenging the law can prove otherwise, the courts will generally decide the discriminatory practice is allowed. In these cases, the courts are applying the rational basis test. That is, as long as there’s a reason for treating some people differently that is “rationally related to a legitimate government interest,” the discriminatory act or law or policy is acceptable.4 For example, since letting blind people operate cars would be dangerous to others on the road, the law forbidding them to drive is reasonably justified on the grounds of safety and is therefore allowed even though it discriminates against the blind. Similarly, when universities and colleges refuse to admit students who fail to meet a certain test score or GPA, they can discriminate against students with weaker grades and test scores because these students most likely do not yet possess the knowledge or skills needed to do well in their classes and graduate from the institution. The universities and colleges have a legitimate reason for denying these students entrance.

[.my2]
这个问题的答案在于歧视行为的目的 。在大多数法院裁定歧视是否违法时，政府只需证明其有正当理由即可。除非挑战法律的个人或团体能够证明相反的情况，否则法院通常会裁定歧视行为合法。在这些情况下，法院适用的是合理性检验标准 。也就是说，只要区别对待某些人的理由“与合法的政府利益合理相关”，歧视性行为、法律或政策就是可以接受的。 例如 ，由于允许盲人驾驶汽车会对其他道路使用者造成危险，因此禁止盲人驾驶的法律基于安全理由是合理的，即使它歧视盲人，也是允许的。同样，当大学和学院拒绝录取未达到特定考试分数或 GPA 要求的学生时，它们可能歧视成绩较差的学生，因为这些学生很可能尚未具备在课堂上取得好成绩并从学校毕业所需的知识或技能。大学和学院有正当理由拒绝这些学生入学。

The courts, however, are much more skeptical when it comes to certain other forms of discrimination. Because of the United States’ history of ethnic, racial, gender, and religious discrimination, the courts apply more stringent rules to policies, laws, and actions that discriminate on these bases (race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or national origin).5
然而，对于某些其他形式的歧视，法院的态度则要谨慎得多。由于美国历史上存在种族、民族、性别和宗教歧视，法院对基于这些因素（种族、民族、性别、宗教或国籍）进行歧视的政策、法律和行为适用更为严格的规则 。5

Discrimination based on gender or sex is generally examined with intermediate scrutiny. The standard of intermediate scrutiny was first applied by the Supreme Court in Craig v. Boren (1976) and again in Clark v. Jeter (1988).6 It requires the government to demonstrate that treating men and women differently is “substantially related to an important governmental objective.” This puts the burden of proof on the government to demonstrate why the unequal treatment is justifiable, not on the individual who alleges unfair discrimination has taken place. In practice, this means laws that treat men and women differently are sometimes upheld, although usually they are not. For example, in the 1980s and 1990s, the courts ruled that states could not operate single-sex institutions of higher education and that such schools, like South Carolina’s military college The Citadel, shown in Figure 5.2, must admit both male and female students.7 Women in the military are now also allowed to serve in all combat roles, although the courts have continued to allow the Selective Service System (the draft) to register only men and not women.8
基于性别的歧视通常采用中间审查标准进行审查。中间审查标准最早由最高法院在克雷格诉博伦案 （1976 年）中提出，后又在克拉克诉杰特案 （1988 年）中再次应用。 6 该标准要求政府证明区别对待男性和女性“与一项重要的政府目标密切相关”。这意味着举证责任在于政府 ，而非声称遭受不公平歧视的个人，政府必须证明这种不平等待遇的合理性。在实践中，这意味着区别对待男性和女性的法律有时会得到支持，尽管通常情况下并非如此。例如，在 20 世纪 80 年代和 90 年代，法院裁定各州不得设立单一性别的高等教育机构，此类学校，例如图 5.2 所示的南卡罗来纳州军事学院“城堡军校”，必须同时招收男女学生。 7. 尽管法院仍然允许兵役登记制度（征兵制度）只登记男性而不登记女性，但女性现在也被允许在军队中担任所有作战角色。8 .

Discrimination against members of racial, ethnic, or religious groups or those of various national origins is reviewed to the greatest degree by the courts, which apply the strict scrutiny standard in these cases. Under strict scrutiny, the burden of proof is on the government to demonstrate that there is a compelling governmental interest in treating people from one group differently from those who are not part of that group—the law or action can be “narrowly tailored” to achieve the goal in question, and that it is the “least restrictive means” available to achieve that goal.9 In other words, if there is a non-discriminatory way to accomplish the goal in question, discrimination should not take place. In the modern era, laws and actions that are challenged under strict scrutiny have rarely been upheld. Strict scrutiny, however, was the legal basis for the Supreme Court’s 1944 upholding of the legality of the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, discussed later in this chapter.10 Finally, affirmative action consists of government programs and policies designed to benefit members of groups historically subject to discrimination. Much of the controversy surrounding affirmative action is about whether strict scrutiny should be applied to these cases.

[.my2]
对种族、民族、宗教团体成员或不同国籍人士的歧视，会受到法院最严格的审查，法院在这些案件中适用严格审查标准。在严格审查下，举证责任在于政府，政府必须证明其有充分的理由区别对待某一群体成员与非该群体成员——法律或行为必须“经过精心设计”以实现特定目标，并且是实现该目标的“限制性最小的手段”。9 换言之 ，如果存在非歧视性的方式来实现特定目标，则不应进行歧视。在现代，根据严格审查标准受到挑战的法律和行为很少得到支持。然而，最高法院在 1944 年维持二战期间日裔美国人拘留合法性的法律依据正是严格审查标准，本章稍后将对此进行讨论。 10. 最后， 平权行动是指政府为使历史上遭受歧视的群体成员受益而制定的各项计划和政策。围绕平权行动的大部分争议在于是否应在这些案例中适用严格审查标准。

PUTTING CIVIL RIGHTS IN THE CONSTITUTION
将公民权利写入宪法
At the time of the nation’s founding, of course, the treatment of many groups was unequal: the rights of women were decidedly fewer than those of men, and neither they, the hundreds of thousands of enslaved people of African descent, or indigenous Americans were considered fully human, let alone U.S. citizens. While the early United States was perhaps a more inclusive society than most of the world at that time, equal treatment of all remained a radical idea.

[.my2]
当然，在建国之初，许多群体的待遇并不平等：妇女的权利远逊于男子，她们、数十万被奴役的非洲裔奴隶以及美洲原住民都不被视为完整的人，更遑论美国公民。尽管早期的美国或许比当时世界上大多数国家更具包容性，但人人平等的理念在当时仍然十分激进。

The aftermath of the Civil War marked a turning point for civil rights. The Republican majority in Congress was enraged by the actions of the reconstituted governments of the southern states. In these states, many former Confederate politicians and their sympathizers returned to power and attempted to circumvent the Thirteenth Amendment’s freeing of enslaved men and women by passing laws known as the Black codes. These laws were designed to reduce formerly enslaved people to the status of serfs or indentured servants. Black people were not just denied the right to vote, but also could be arrested and jailed for vagrancy or idleness if they lacked jobs. Black people were excluded from public schools and state colleges and were subject to violence at the hands of White people (Figure 5.3).11
内战结束后，民权运动迎来了一个转折点。国会中的共和党多数派对南方各州重建后的政府的行为感到愤怒。在这些州，许多前南方邦联政客及其同情者重返政坛，试图通过颁布被称为 “黑人法典” 的法律来规避第十三修正案对奴隶的解放。这些法律旨在将曾经的奴隶降格为农奴或契约劳工。黑人不仅被剥夺了投票权，而且如果失业，还会因游荡或游手好闲而被逮捕入狱。黑人被排除在公立学校和州立大学之外，并遭受白人的暴力对待（ 图 5.3 ）。 11

White southerners, angered by their defeat in the Civil War and the loss of the enslaved people they considered property, attacked and killed formerly enslaved people, destroyed their property, and terrorized White northerners who attempted to improve the lives of freed men and women.

To override the southern states’ actions, lawmakers in Congress proposed two amendments to the Constitution designed to give political equality and power to formerly enslaved people. Once passed by Congress and ratified by the necessary number of states, these became the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. In addition to including the equal protection clause as noted above, the Fourteenth Amendment also was designed to ensure that the states would respect the civil liberties of freed people. The Fifteenth Amendment was proposed to secure the right to vote for Black men, which will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter.

[.my2]
为了推翻南方各州的行动，国会议员提出了两项​​宪法修正案，旨在赋予前奴隶政治平等和权力。这两项修正案经国会通过并由足够数量的州批准后，成为宪法第十四修正案和第十五修正案。除了包含上文提到的平等保护条款外，第十四修正案还旨在确保各州尊重获得自由的奴隶的公民自由 。第十五修正案旨在保障黑人男性的投票权，本章稍后将对此进行更详细的讨论。

IDENTIFYING CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUES
识别公民权利问题
Looking back, it’s relatively easy to identify civil rights issues that arose, looking into the future is much harder. For example, few people fifty years ago would have identified the rights of gay or transgender Americans as an important civil rights issue, or predicted it would become one. Similarly, in past decades the rights of those with disabilities, particularly intellectual disabilities, were often ignored by the public at large. Many people with disabilities were institutionalized and given little further thought, and until very recently, laws remained on the books in some states allowing those with intellectual or developmental disabilities to be subject to forced sterilization.12 Today, most of us view this treatment as barbaric.

[.my2]
回顾过去，识别曾经出现的民权问题相对容易，但展望未来则困难得多。例如，五十年前，很少有人会把同性恋或跨性别美国人的权利视为重要的民权问题，或者预料到它会成为重要的民权问题。同样，在过去的几十年里，残疾人，特别是智力残疾人的权利，常常被公众忽视。许多残疾人被送进机构，鲜少有人关心他们的生活，直到最近，一些州的法律仍然允许对智力或发育障碍人士进行强制绝育。 如今 ，我们大多数人都认为这种做法是野蛮的。

Clearly, then, new civil rights issues can emerge over time. How can we, as citizens, identify them as they emerge and distinguish genuine claims of discrimination from claims by those who have merely been unable to convince a majority to agree with their viewpoints? For example, how do we decide if sixteen-year-olds are discriminated against because they are not allowed to vote, as some U.S. lawmakers are starting to suggest? We can identify true discrimination by applying the following analytical process:
显然，新的公民权利问题会随着时间的推移而出现。作为公民，我们如何才能识别出这些问题，并区分真正的歧视指控和那些仅仅因为无法说服大多数人接受其观点而提出的指控呢？例如，一些美国立法者开始提出，剥夺 16 岁青少年的投票权是否构成歧视？我们可以通过以下分析过程来识别真正的歧视：
