== 释义





Throughout history, both small and large nations have elevated certain types of nonelected workers to positions of relative power within the governmental structure. Collectively, these essential workers are called the bureaucracy. A bureaucracy is an administrative group of nonelected officials charged with carrying out functions connected to a series of policies and programs. In the United States, the bureaucracy began as a very small collection of individuals. Over time, however, it grew to be a major force in political affairs. Indeed, it grew so large that politicians in modern times have ridiculed it to great political advantage. However, the country’s many bureaucrats or civil servants, the individuals who work in the bureaucracy, fill necessary and even instrumental roles in every area of government: from high-level positions in foreign affairs and intelligence collection agencies to clerks and staff in the smallest regulatory agencies. They are hired, or sometimes appointed, for their expertise in carrying out the functions and programs of the government. For example, the National Weather Service, which is located in the Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) with forecast offices embedded across the country, gathers data and makes predictions about weather patterns in order to protect citizens and their property. Citizens, community leaders and weather journalists make regular use of their data and predictions on a daily basis.

纵观历史，无论大小国家，都曾将某些类型的非民选工作人员提升到政府结构中相对重要的职位。这些至关重要的工作人员统称为官僚机构。 官僚机构是由非民选官员组成的行政团体，负责执行一系列政策和计划相关的职能。在美国，官僚机构最初规模很小。然而，随着时间的推移，它发展成为政治事务中的一支重要力量。事实上，它发展得如此庞大，以至于现代政客们常常利用嘲讽来获取巨大的政治利益。然而，美国众多的官僚或公务员 ，即在官僚机构中工作的个人，在政府的各个领域都扮演着必要甚至至关重要的角色：从外交事务和情报机构的高级职位，到最小的监管机构的职员和工作人员。他们因其在执行政府职能和计划方面的专业知识而被聘用，有时甚至是被任命。例如，隶属于商务部国家海洋和大气管理局（NOAA）的国家气象局，在全国各地设有预报办公室，负责收集数据并预测天气模式，以保护公民及其财产安全。公民、社区领袖和气象记者每天都会定期使用这些数据和预测。

WHAT DOES A BUREAUCRACY DO?
官僚机构是做什么的？
Modern society relies on the effective functioning of government to provide public goods, enhance quality of life, and stimulate economic growth. The activities by which government achieves these functions include—but are not limited to—taxation, homeland security, immigration, foreign affairs, and education. The more society grows and the need for government services expands, the more challenging bureaucratic management and public administration becomes. Public administration is both the implementation of public policy in government bureaucracies and the academic study that prepares civil servants for work in those organizations.

[.my2]
现代社会依赖政府的有效运作来提供公共产品、提升生活质量并促进经济增长。政府履行这些职能的活动包括但不限于税收、国土安全、移民、外交和教育。随着社会的发展和对政府服务需求的增加，官僚机构的管理和公共行政也面临着越来越大的挑战。公共行政既指政府机构中公共政策的实施，也指为公务员在这些机构中工作做好准备的学术研究。

The classic version of a bureaucracy is hierarchical and can be described by an organizational chart that outlines the separation of tasks and worker specialization while also establishing a clear unity of command by assigning each employee to only one boss. Moreover, the classic bureaucracy employs a division of labor under which work is separated into smaller tasks assigned to different people or groups. Given this definition, bureaucracy is not unique to government but is also found in the private and nonprofit sectors. That is, almost all organizations are bureaucratic regardless of their scope and size; although public and private organizations differ in some important ways. For example, while private organizations are responsible to a superior authority such as an owner, board of directors, or shareholders, federal governmental organizations answer equally to the president, Congress, the courts, and ultimately the public. The underlying goals of private and public organizations also differ. While private organizations seek to survive by controlling costs, increasing market share, and realizing a profit, public organizations find it more difficult to measure the elusive goal of operating with efficiency and effectiveness.

[.my2]
经典的官僚机构是层级分明的，可以用组织结构图来描述，该图清晰地展示了任务的划分和员工的专业化分工，并通过为每位员工指定一位上级来建立明确的统一指挥。此外，经典的官僚机构采用劳动分工，将工作分解成更小的任务，分配给不同的人员或团队。根据这一定义，官僚机构并非政府独有，也存在于私营部门和非营利部门。也就是说，几乎所有组织，无论其规模大小，都具有官僚性质；尽管公共组织和私营组织在一些重要方面存在差异。例如，私营组织对所有者、董事会或股东等上级机构负责，而联邦政府组织则对总统、国会、法院以及最终的公众负责。私营组织和公共组织的根本目标也不同。私营组织力求通过控制成本、扩大市场份额和实现盈利来生存，而公共组织则发现衡量高效运营这一难以捉摸的目标更加困难。

Bureaucracy may seem like a modern invention, but bureaucrats have served in governments for nearly as long as governments have existed. Archaeologists and historians point to the sometimes elaborate bureaucratic systems of the ancient world, from the Egyptian scribes who recorded inventories to the biblical tax collectors who kept the wheels of government well greased.1 In Europe, government bureaucracy and its study emerged before democracies did. In contrast, in the United States, a democracy and the Constitution came first, followed by the development of national governmental organizations as needed, and then finally the study of U.S. government bureaucracies and public administration emerged.2
官僚机构看似是现代的发明，但实际上，官僚在政府中服务的历史几乎与政府本身一样悠久。考古学家和历史学家指出，古代世界有时也存在着复杂的官僚体系，从记录财产清单的埃及文士到圣经中负责政府运转的税吏，都印证了这一点。 1 在欧洲，政府官僚机构及其研究出现早于民主制度。相比之下，在美国，民主制度和宪法先于国家政府机构的建立而出现，随后根据需要发展了国家政府组织，最后才出现了对美国政府官僚机构和公共行政的研究。 2

In fact, the long pedigree of bureaucracy is an enduring testament to the necessity of administrative organization. More recently, modern bureaucratic management emerged in the eighteenth century from Scottish economist Adam Smith’s support for the efficiency of the division of labor and from Welsh reformer Robert Owen’s belief that employees are vital instruments in the functioning of an organization. However, it was not until the mid-1800s that the German scholar Lorenz von Stein argued for public administration as both a theory and a practice since its knowledge is generated and evaluated through the process of gathering evidence. For example, a public administration scholar might gather data to see whether the timing of tax collection during a particular season might lead to higher compliance or returns. Credited with being the father of the science of public administration, von Stein opened the path of administrative enlightenment for other scholars in industrialized nations.

[.my2]
事实上，官僚机构的悠久历史本身就是行政组织必要性的有力证明。近代官僚管理兴起于十八世纪，源于苏格兰经济学家亚当·斯密对劳动分工效率的支持，以及威尔士改革家罗伯特·欧文关于雇员是组织运作关键工具的理念。然而，直到19世纪中期，德国学者洛伦茨·冯·施泰因才提出公共行政既是一门理论又是一门实践，因为其知识的产生和评估都依赖于证据的收集过程。例如，公共行政学者可能会收集数据，以探究在特定季节征税是否能提高税收遵从度或税收收益。冯·施泰因被誉为公共行政学的奠基人，他为工业化国家的其他学者开辟了行政启蒙之路。

THE ORIGINS OF THE U.S. BUREAUCRACY
美国官僚机构的起源
In the early U.S. republic, the bureaucracy was quite small. This is understandable since the American Revolution was largely a revolt against executive power and the British imperial administrative order. Nevertheless, while neither the word “bureaucracy” nor its synonyms appear in the text of the Constitution, the document does establish a few broad channels through which the emerging government could develop the necessary bureaucratic administration.

[.my2]
在美国共和国早期，官僚机构规模很小。这不难理解，因为美国革命在很大程度上是一场反抗行政权力和英国帝国行政秩序的起义。尽管宪法文本中既没有出现“官僚机构”一词，也没有出现其同义词，但宪法确实确立了一些主要途径，使新兴政府能够发展必要的官僚行政体系。

For example, Article II, Section 2, provides the president the power to appoint officers and department heads. In the following section, the president is further empowered to see that the laws are “faithfully executed.” More specifically, Article I, Section 8, empowers Congress to establish a post office, build roads, regulate commerce, coin money, and regulate the value of money. Granting the president and Congress such responsibilities appears to anticipate a bureaucracy of some size. Yet the design of the bureaucracy is not described, and it does not occupy its own section of the Constitution as bureaucracy often does in other countries’ governing documents; the design and form were left to be established in practice.

[.my2]
例如， 宪法第二条第二款赋予总统任命官员和部门负责人的权力。在接下来的条款中，总统被进一步授权确保法律“忠实执行”。更具体地说， 宪法第一条第八款授权国会设立邮局、修建道路、监管商业、铸造货币以及调节货币价值。赋予总统和国会这些职责似乎预示着一个规模庞大的官僚机构的出现。然而，宪法并未描述官僚机构的具体架构，也没有像其他国家的宪法文件中那样，专门用一个章节来阐述官僚机构；其架构和形式留待实践中逐步形成。

Under President George Washington, the bureaucracy remained small enough to accomplish only the necessary tasks at hand.3 Washington’s tenure saw the creation of the Department of State to oversee international issues, the Department of the Treasury to control coinage, and the Department of War to administer the armed forces. The employees within these three departments, in addition to the growing postal service, constituted the major portion of the federal bureaucracy for the first three decades of the republic (Figure 15.2). Two developments, however, contributed to the growth of the bureaucracy well beyond these humble beginnings.

[.my2]
在乔治· 华盛顿总统任期内，官僚机构规模较小，仅能完成必要的日常工作。华盛顿任期内，国务院负责国际事务，财政部负责货币发行，陆军部负责管理军队。这三个部门的雇员，加上日益壮大的邮政系统，构成了共和国成立后前三十年联邦官僚机构的主要部分（ 图 15.2 ）。然而，两项发展促使官僚机构迅速扩张，远远超出了最初的规模。

The small size of this group reflected the small size of the U.S. government in the late eighteenth century. (credit: modification of work by the Library of Congress)

The first development was the rise of centralized party politics in the 1820s. Under President Andrew Jackson, many thousands of party loyalists filled the ranks of the bureaucratic offices around the country. This was the beginning of the spoils system, in which political appointments were transformed into political patronage doled out by the president on the basis of party loyalty.4 Political patronage is the use of state resources to reward individuals for their political support. The term “spoils” here refers to paid positions in the U.S. government. As the saying goes, “to the victor,” in this case the incoming president, “go the spoils.” It was assumed that government would work far more efficiently if the key federal posts were occupied by those already supportive of the president and his policies. This system served to enforce party loyalty by tying the livelihoods of the party faithful to the success or failure of the party. The number of federal posts the president sought to use as appropriate rewards for supporters swelled over the following decades.

[.my2]
第一个发展是 19 世纪 20 年代中央集权政党政治的兴起。在安德鲁·杰克逊总统的领导下，成千上万的党派忠诚者占据了全国各地的官僚机构。这标志着 “分赃制” 的开端，政治任命被转化为总统根据党派忠诚度分配的政治庇护。政治庇护是指利用国家资源奖励那些对政治支持的人。这里的“分赃”指的是美国政府中的带薪职位。正如俗语所说，“胜者为王”，在这种情况下指的是即将上任的总统，“分赃归于胜者”。人们认为，如果关键的联邦职位由那些已经支持总统及其政策的人担任，政府的运作效率会更高。这一制度通过将党派忠实拥护者的生计与党的成败挂钩，从而强化了党派忠诚。在接下来的几十年里，总统试图用来奖励支持者的联邦职位数量不断增加。

The second development was industrialization, which in the late nineteenth century significantly increased both the population and economic size of the United States. These changes in turn brought about urban growth in a number of places across the East and Midwest. Railroads and telegraph lines drew the country together and increased the potential for federal centralization. The government and its bureaucracy were closely involved in creating concessions for and providing land to the western railways stretching across the plains and beyond the Rocky Mountains. These changes set the groundwork for the regulatory framework that emerged in the early twentieth century.

[.my2]
第二个发展是工业化，它在19世纪末显著提升了美国的人口和经济规模。这些变化反过来又促进了东部和中西部许多地区的城市化进程。铁路和电报线路将国家连接起来，并增强了联邦集权的可能性。政府及其官僚机构密切参与了西部铁路的建设，这些铁路横跨平原，延伸至落基山脉以西。这些变化为20世纪初出现的监管框架奠定了基础。

THE FALL OF POLITICAL PATRONAGE
政治庇护制度的衰落
Patronage had the advantage of putting political loyalty to work by making the government quite responsive to the electorate and keeping election turnout robust because so much was at stake. However, the spoils system also had a number of obvious disadvantages. It was a reciprocal system. Clients who wanted positions in the civil service pledged their political loyalty to a particular patron who then provided them with their desired positions. These arrangements directed the power and resources of government toward perpetuating the reward system. They replaced the system that early presidents like Thomas Jefferson had fostered, in which the country’s intellectual and economic elite rose to the highest levels of the federal bureaucracy based on their relative merit.5 Criticism of the spoils system grew, especially in the mid-1870s, after numerous scandals rocked the administration of President Ulysses S. Grant (Figure 15.3).

[.my2]
庇护制度的优势在于它能有效利用政治忠诚，使政府对选民的需求做出快速反应，并由于事关重大而保持较高的选举投票率。然而，这种分赃制也存在诸多显而易见的弊端。它是一种互惠制度。那些渴望在公务员队伍中获得职位的人，必须向特定的庇护人宣誓效忠，而庇护人则会为他们提供理想的职位。这种安排使得政府的权力和资源得以持续，从而维护了这种奖励制度。它取代了像托马斯·杰斐逊这样的早期总统所倡导的制度——在杰斐逊的制度下，国家的知识和经济精英凭借自身的能力晋升到联邦官僚机构的最高层。5 对分赃制的批评日益增多，尤其是在 19 世纪 70 年代中期，尤利西斯·S·格兰特总统的政府丑闻不断曝光之后（ 图 15.3 ）。

Image A is an illustration of Ulysses S. Grant being sworn in as President of the United States. Image B is a cartoon featuring a statue of Andrew Jackson riding a pig over a bed of skulls. A plaque on the pedestal reads “To the victors belong the spoils.”
Figure   数字 15.3 It was under President Ulysses S. Grant, shown in this engraving being sworn in by Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase at his inauguration in 1873 (a), that the inefficiencies and opportunities for corruption embedded in the spoils system reached their height. Grant was famously loyal to his supporters, a characteristic that—combined with postwar opportunities for corruption—created scandal in his administration. This political cartoon from 1877 (b), nearly half a century after Andrew Jackson was elected president, ridicules the spoils system that was one of his legacies. In it he is shown riding a pig, which is walking over “fraud,” “bribery,” and “spoils” and feeding on “plunder.” (credit a, b: modification of work by the Library of Congress)
在尤利西斯·S·格兰特总统的领导下（如图 a 所示，格兰特于 1873 年就职典礼上由首席大法官萨蒙·P·蔡斯主持宣誓），分赃制中存在的低效和腐败机会达到了顶峰。格兰特以其对支持者的忠诚而闻名，这一特点——再加上战后腐败的机会——导致他的政府丑闻不断。这幅创作于 1877 年的政治漫画（图 b）讽刺了杰克逊留下的分赃制遗产之一。杰克逊当选总统近半个世纪后，漫画中他骑着一头猪，猪踩着“欺诈”、“贿赂”和“战利品”，享用着“掠夺”。（图片 a、b：经美国国会图书馆修改）
As the negative aspects of political patronage continued to infect bureaucracy in the late nineteenth century, calls for civil service reform grew louder. Those supporting the patronage system held that their positions were well earned; those who condemned it argued that federal legislation was needed to ensure jobs were awarded on the basis of merit. Eventually, after President James Garfield had been assassinated by a disappointed office seeker (Figure 15.4), Congress responded to cries for reform with the Pendleton Act, also called the Civil Service Reform Act of 1883. The act established the Civil Service Commission, a centralized agency charged with ensuring that the federal government’s selection, retention, and promotion practices were based on open, competitive examinations in a merit system.6 The passage of this law sparked a period of social activism and political reform that continued well into the twentieth century.

[.my2]
19 世纪末，政治庇护的负面影响持续侵蚀官僚机构，要求公务员制度改革的呼声日益高涨。支持庇护制度的人认为他们的职位是实至名归；而反对者则认为，需要联邦立法来确保职位授予以能力为依据。最终，在詹姆斯·加菲尔德总统被一名落选的求职者刺杀后（ 图 15.4 ），国会通过了《 彭德尔顿法案》 （又称《1883 年公务员制度改革法案 》），以回应改革的呼声。该法案设立了公务员委员会，这是一个中央机构，负责确保联邦政府的选拔、留任和晋升都基于公开、竞争性的考试和择优录取制度 。 6 该法案的通过引发了一场持续到 20 世纪的社会运动和政治改革浪潮。

As an active member and leader of the Progressive movement, President Woodrow Wilson is often considered the father of U.S. public administration. Born in Virginia and educated in history and political science at Johns Hopkins University, Wilson became a respected intellectual in his fields with an interest in public service and a profound sense of moralism. He was named president of Princeton University, became president of the American Political Science Association, was elected governor of New Jersey, and finally was elected the twenty-eighth president of the United States in 1912.

[.my2]
作为进步运动的积极成员和领袖，伍德罗· 威尔逊总统常被誉为美国公共行政之父。他出生于弗吉尼亚州，在约翰·霍普金斯大学接受历史和政治学教育，成为其领域内受人尊敬的知识分子，对公共服务充满热情，并具有深厚的道德情操。他曾任普林斯顿大学校长、美国政治学会主席，当选新泽西州州长，并于 1912 年当选为美国第二十八任总统。

It was through his educational training and vocational experiences that Wilson began to identify the need for a public administration discipline. He felt it was getting harder to run a constitutional government than to actually frame one. His stance was that “It is the object of administrative study to discover, first, what government can properly and successfully do, and, secondly, how it can do these proper things with the utmost efficiency. . .”7 Wilson declared that while politics does set tasks for administration, public administration should be built on a science of management, and political science should be concerned with the way governments are administered. Therefore, administrative activities should be devoid of political manipulations.8
威尔逊正是通过他的教育训练和职业经历，开始意识到建立公共行政学科的必要性。他感到，管理一个宪政政府比实际构建一个宪政政府更加困难。他的观点是：“行政研究的目标首先是发现政府能够恰当且成功地做什么，其次是发现政府如何才能以最高的效率做这些恰当的事情……” 7 威尔逊宣称，虽然政治确实会为行政部门设定任务，但公共行政应该建立在管理科学的基础上，而政治学则应该关注政府的运作方式。因此，行政活动应该避免政治操纵。 8

Wilson advocated separating politics from administration by three key means: making comparative analyses of public and private organizations, improving efficiency with business-like practices, and increasing effectiveness through management and training. Wilson’s point was that while politics should be kept separate from administration, administration should not be insensitive to public opinion. Rather, the bureaucracy should act with a sense of vigor to understand and appreciate public opinion. Still, Wilson acknowledged that the separation of politics from administration was an ideal and not necessarily an achievable reality.

[.my2]
威尔逊主张通过三种关键途径将政治与行政分离：对公共和私营组织进行比较分析；运用商业化的做法提高效率；以及通过管理和培训提升效能。威尔逊的观点是，虽然政治应当与行政分离，但行政部门不应忽视公众舆论。相反，官僚机构应当积极主动地了解和重视公众舆论。然而，威尔逊也承认，政治与行政的分离是一种理想，并非必然能够实现。

THE BUREAUCRACY COMES OF AGE
官僚机构走向成熟
The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were a time of great bureaucratic growth in the United States: The Interstate Commerce Commission was established in 1887, the Federal Reserve Board in 1913, the Federal Trade Commission in 1914, and the Federal Power Commission in 1920.

[.my2]
十九世纪末二十世纪初是美国官僚机构快速发展的时期：州际商务委员会成立于 1887 年，联邦储备委员会成立于 1913 年，联邦贸易委员会成立于 1914 年，联邦电力委员会成立于 1920 年。

With the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, the United States faced record levels of unemployment and the associated fall into poverty, food shortages, and general desperation. When the Republican president and Congress were not seen as moving aggressively enough to fix the situation, the Democrats won the 1932 election in overwhelming fashion. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the U.S. Congress rapidly reorganized the government’s problem-solving efforts into a series of programs designed to revive the economy, stimulate economic development, and generate employment opportunities. In the 1930s, the federal bureaucracy grew with the addition of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to protect and regulate U.S. banking, the National Labor Relations Board to regulate the way companies could treat their workers, the Securities and Exchange Commission to regulate the stock market, and the Civil Aeronautics Board to regulate air travel. Additional programs and institutions emerged with the Social Security Administration in 1935 and then, during World War II, various wartime boards and agencies. By 1940, approximately 700,000 U.S. workers were employed in the federal bureaucracy.9
1929 年大萧条爆发后，美国面临着前所未有的失业率，随之而来的是贫困、粮食短缺和普遍的绝望。由于共和党总统和国会被认为行动不够积极，未能有效解决这一问题，民主党在 1932 年的总统大选中以压倒性优势获胜。富兰克林· 罗斯福总统和美国国会迅速重组政府的应对措施，推出了一系列旨在重振经济、刺激经济发展和创造就业机会的项目。20 世纪 30 年代，随着联邦存款保险公司（FDIC）的成立（负责保护和监管美国银行业）、国家劳工关系委员会（NLRB）的成立（负责监管公司对待员工的方式）、证券交易委员会（SEC）的成立（负责监管股票市场）以及民用航空委员会（负责监管航空旅行）的成立，联邦政府机构不断壮大。1935 年，社会保障署成立，随后在二战期间，又成立了各种战时委员会和机构，进一步推动了联邦政府机构的改革。到 1940 年，美国联邦政府机构约有 70 万名雇员 。9

Under President Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1960s, that number reached 2.2 million, and the federal budget increased to $332 billion.10 This growth came as a result of what Johnson called his Great Society program, intended to use the power of government to relieve suffering and accomplish social good. The Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 was designed to help end poverty by creating a Job Corps and a Neighborhood Youth Corps. Volunteers in Service to America was a type of domestic Peace Corps intended to relieve the effects of poverty. Johnson also directed more funding to public education, created Medicare as a national insurance program for the elderly, and raised standards for consumer products.

[.my2]
在 20 世纪 60 年代林登· 约翰逊总统执政期间，这一数字达到了 220 万，联邦预算也增加到 3320 亿美元。 10 这一增长源于约翰逊所谓的“伟大社会”计划，该计划旨在利用政府的力量来减轻民众苦难，实现社会福祉。1964 年的《 经济机会法案》 旨在通过设立就业队和社区青年队来帮助消除贫困。“美国志愿服务队”类似于国内的和平队，旨在缓解贫困的影响。约翰逊还增加了对公共教育的投入，创建了面向老年人的全国性医疗保险计划——医疗保险（Medicare），并提高了消费品的标准。

All of these new programs required bureaucrats to run them, and the national bureaucracy naturally ballooned. Its size became a rallying cry for conservatives, who eventually elected Ronald Reagan president for the express purpose of reducing the bureaucracy. While Reagan was able to work with Congress to reduce some aspects of the federal bureaucracy, he contributed to its expansion in other ways, particularly in his efforts to fight the Cold War.11 For example, Reagan and Congress increased the defense budget dramatically over the course of the 1980s.12 After the end of the Cold War and the dismantling of the Berlin Wall, which was an important symbol of East-West conflict during that time, the 1990s brought discussion of a "Peace Dividend"—that is, with the threat of global thermonuclear war significantly reduced, the U.S. could stand to reduce defense spending and direct resources to other areas.13 However, after a decade of retrenchment in military and defense spending, the 9/11 attacks induced a new era of massive investment in defense and homeland security. Indeed, President Joe Biden's plans to withdraw from Afghanistan come twenty years after the fact.14
所有这些新项目都需要官僚机构来运作，国家官僚机构自然而然地膨胀起来。官僚机构的庞大规模成为保守派的动员口号，他们最终选举罗纳德 ·里根担任总统，其明确目的就是削减官僚机构。虽然里根能够与国会合作，削减联邦官僚机构的某些方面，但他在其他方面也助长了官僚机构的扩张，尤其是在他为应对冷战所做的努力中。 11 例如，在 20 世纪 80 年代，里根和国会大幅增加了国防预算。 12 冷战结束后，柏林墙被拆除，柏林墙是当时东西方冲突的重要象征。20 世纪 90 年代出现了关于“和平红利”的讨论——也就是说，随着全球热核战争威胁的显著降低，美国可以削减国防开支，并将资源转向其他领域。 13 然而，在经历了十年的军事和国防开支紧缩之后，9·11 恐怖袭击引发了国防和国土安全领域大规模投资的新时代。事实上，乔·拜登总统的阿富汗撤军计划是在事发二十年后才提出的 。14

“The Nine Most Terrifying Words in the English Language”
英语中最恐怖的九个词
The two periods of increased bureaucratic growth in the United States, the 1930s and the 1960s, accomplished far more than expanding the size of government. They transformed politics in ways that continue to shape political debate today. While the bureaucracies created in these two periods served important purposes, many at that time and even now argue that the expansion came with unacceptable costs, particularly economic costs. The common argument that bureaucratic regulation smothers capitalist innovation was especially powerful in the Cold War environment of the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. But as long as voters felt they were benefiting from the bureaucratic expansion, as they typically did, the political winds supported continued growth.

[.my2]
美国历史上两次官僚机构快速扩张的时期——20 世纪 30 年代和 60 年代——其影响远不止于扩大政府规模。它们从根本上改变了政治格局，其影响至今仍在左右着政治辩论。尽管这两个时期建立的官僚机构发挥了重要作用，但当时乃至现在，许多人都认为这种扩张带来了不可接受的代价，尤其是经济代价。官僚机构监管扼杀资本主义创新的普遍观点在 20 世纪 60 年代、70 年代和 80 年代的冷战背景下尤为盛行。然而，只要选民们认为自己能从官僚机构的扩张中获益（而他们通常确实如此），政治风向就会支持这种扩张的持续发展。

In the 1970s, however, Germany and Japan were thriving economies in positions to compete with U.S. industry. This competition, combined with technological advances and the beginnings of computerization, began to eat away at American prosperity. Factories began to close, wages began to stagnate, inflation climbed, and the future seemed a little less bright. In this environment, tax-paying workers were less likely to support generous welfare programs designed to end poverty. They felt these bureaucratic programs were adding to their misery in order to support unknown others.

[.my2]
然而，到了20世纪70年代，德国和日本经济蓬勃发展，足以与美国工业展开竞争。这种竞争，加上技术进步和计算机化的萌芽，开始蚕食美国的繁荣。工厂开始倒闭，工资停滞不前，通货膨胀加剧，未来似乎黯淡无光。在这种环境下，纳税的工人们不太可能支持旨在消除贫困的慷慨福利项目。他们觉得这些官僚主义的项目是为了帮助那些素不相识的人，反而加重了他们的苦难。

In his first and unsuccessful presidential bid in 1976, Ronald Reagan, a skilled politician and governor of California, stoked working-class anxieties by directing voters’ discontent at the bureaucratic dragon he proposed to slay. When he ran again four years later, his criticism of bureaucratic waste in Washington carried him to a landslide victory. While it is debatable whether Reagan actually reduced the size of government, he continued to wield rhetoric about bureaucratic waste to great political advantage. Even as late as 1986, he continued to rail against the Washington bureaucracy (Figure 15.5), once declaring famously that “the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.”
1976 年，罗纳德·里根首次竞选总统，但以失败告终。这位老练的政治家、加州州长，利用选民对官僚机构的不满，煽动了工人阶级的焦虑情绪，并承诺要铲除这头“官僚巨龙”。四年后，他再次参选，对华盛顿官僚机构浪费的抨击为他赢得了压倒性胜利。尽管里根是否真正缩减了政府规模尚存争议，但他持续利用关于官僚机构浪费的言论，获得了巨大的政治利益。即使到了 1986 年，他仍然抨击华盛顿的官僚机构（ 图 15.5 ），他曾发表过一句名言：“英语中最可怕的九个字是：‘我是政府派来的，我是来帮忙的。’”

Why might people be more sympathetic to bureaucratic growth during periods of prosperity? In what way do modern politicians continue to stir up popular animosity against bureaucracy to political advantage? Is it effective? Why or why not?
为什么人们在经济繁荣时期更容易接受官僚机构的扩张？现代政治家如何利用民众对官僚机构的反感来获取政治利益？这种做法有效吗？为什么有效或无效？
