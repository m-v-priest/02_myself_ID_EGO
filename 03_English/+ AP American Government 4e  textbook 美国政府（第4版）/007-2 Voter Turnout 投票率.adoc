== 释义





Campaign managers worry about who will show up at the polls on Election Day. Will more Republicans come? More Democrats? Will a surge in younger voters occur this year, or will an older population cast ballots? We can actually predict with strong accuracy who is likely to vote each year, based on identified influence factors such as age, education, and income. Campaigns will often target each group of voters in different ways, spending precious campaign dollars on the groups already most likely to show up at the polls rather than trying to persuade citizens who are highly unlikely to vote.

竞选经理们担心选举日当天谁会去投票。共和党人会更多吗？民主党人会更多吗？今年会出现年轻选民激增的情况吗？还是老年人会投出自己的一票？实际上，我们可以根据年龄、教育程度和收入等已知的影响因素，相当准确地预测每年哪些人可能会投票。竞选团队通常会针对不同的选民群体采取不同的策略，把宝贵的竞选资金花在那些本来就极有可能去投票的群体上，而不是试图说服那些极不可能投票的选民。

COUNTING VOTERS  清点选票
Low voter turnout has long caused the media and others to express concern and frustration. A healthy democratic society is expected to be filled with citizens who vote regularly and participate in the electoral process. People like Stacey Abrams, who founded Fair Fight Action in 2018, and organizations such as the League of Women Voters and Project Vote Smart (Figure 7.5) work hard to increase voter turnout in all age groups across the United States. But just how low is voter turnout? The answer depends on who is calculating it and how. There are several methods, each of which highlights a different problem with the electoral system in the United States.

长期以来，低投票率一直令媒体和其他人士感到担忧和沮丧。一个健康的民主社会理应拥有积极参与选举进程的公民。像斯泰西·艾布拉姆斯（Stacey Abrams）这样的人，她于 2018 年创立了“公平斗争行动”（Fair Fight Action），以及像“妇女选民联盟”（League of Women Voters）和“智慧投票项目”（Project Vote Smart）（ 图 7.5 ）这样的组织，都在努力提高美国各年龄段选民的投票率。但是，投票率究竟有多低？答案取决于谁在计算以及如何计算。目前有多种计算方法，每一种都揭示了美国选举制度的不同问题。

Calculating voter turnout begins by counting how many ballots were cast in a particular election. These votes must be cast on time, either by mail or in person. The next step is to count how many people could have voted in the same election. This is the number that causes different people to calculate different turnout rates. The complete population of the country includes all people, regardless of age, nationality, ability, health, or freedom. We can count subsections of this population to calculate voter turnout. For instance, the next largest population in the country is the voting-age population (VAP), which consists of persons who are eighteen and older. Some of these persons may not be eligible to vote in their state, but they are included because they are of age to do so.24
计算投票率首先要统计特定选举中实际投出的选票数量。这些选票必须按时投出，可以通过邮寄或亲自投票的方式。下一步是统计在同一次选举中可能拥有投票权的人数。正是这个数字导致不同的人计算出的投票率有所不同。一个国家的总人口包括所有人，无论其年龄、国籍、能力、健康状况或自由程度如何。我们可以统计这个人口中的部分群体来计算投票率。例如，该国人口中第二大群体是达到投票年龄的人口 （VAP），即 18 岁及以上的人。这些人中有些可能不具备在其所在州的投票资格，但由于他们已达到投票年龄，因此也被计入在内 。24

An even smaller group is the voting-eligible population (VEP), citizens eighteen and older who, whether they have registered or not, are eligible to vote because they are citizens, and not imprisoned. If a state has more stringent requirements, such as not having a felony conviction, citizens counted in the VEP must meet those criteria as well. States also have different guidelines or requirements for people with intellectual disabilities, mental illness, and other criteria, which can be used to temporarily or permanently bar people from voting. (The practices have frequently been used in a discriminatory way.) As a result, this population is much harder to measure, but statisticians who use the VEP will generally take the VAP and subtract the state’s prison population and any other known group that cannot vote. This results in a number that is somewhat theoretical; however, in a way, it is more accurate when determining voter turnout.25
还有一个更小的群体是符合投票资格的人口 （VEP），即 18 岁及以上的公民，无论他们是否已登记，只要是公民且未被监禁，就有资格投票。如果某个州有更严格的要求，例如没有重罪记录，那么计入 VEP 的公民也必须符合这些标准。各州对智力障碍、精神疾病患者和其他人群也有不同的指导方针或要求，这些方针或要求可能被用来暂时或永久剥夺某些人的投票权。（这些做法经常被用于歧视性目的。）因此，这个群体更难统计，但使用 VEP 的统计学家通常会用 VAP 减去该州的监狱人口以及任何其他已知无法投票的群体。这样得出的数字在某种程度上是理论上的；然而，在某种程度上，它在确定投票率时更为准确 。25

The last and smallest population is registered voters, who, as the name implies, are citizens currently registered to vote. Now we can appreciate how reports of voter turnout can vary. As Figure 7.6 shows, 83 percent of registered voters voted in the 2024 presidential election, which represents 46 percent of the total U.S. population. While 46 percent is indeed low and might cause alarm, some people included in it are under eighteen, not citizens, or unable to vote due to competency or prison status. The next number shows that just over 59 percent of the voting-age population voted, and 64 percent of the voting-eligible population. The highest turnout ratio is calculated using the smallest population: 84 percent of registered voters voted. Those who argue that a healthy democracy needs high voter turnout will look at the voting-age population or voting-eligible population as proof that the United States has a problem. Those who believe only informed and active citizens should vote point to the registered voter turnout numbers instead. However, looking at only one number can be deceiving. For example, if one compares the percentage of registered voters who voted in 2024 (84 percent) versus 2020 (77 percent), it would seem as if voter turnout had increased significantly; however, if one looks at the percentage of the voting-eligible population who voted in these same years (64 percent in 2024 versus 67 percent in 2020), one can see that is not the case. In fact, the number of votes cast in the 2024 election decreased by over 3.4 million votes. So, while a larger percentage of registered voters voted in 2024 versus 2020, the pool of registered voters was much smaller as was the total number of people who voted.26
最后也是人数最少的群体是登记选民，顾名思义，他们是指目前已登记投票的公民。现在我们可以理解为什么选民投票率的报道会存在差异。如图 7.6 所示，2024 年总统选举中，83% 的登记选民参与了投票，这仅占美国总人口的 46%。虽然 46% 的投票率确实很低，可能会令人担忧，但其中也包括一些未满 18 岁的人、非公民，或者由于能力或服刑等原因无法投票的人。下一个数据显示，超过 59% 的适龄选民参与了投票，64% 的合格选民参与了投票。最高的投票率是使用人数最少的群体计算得出的：84% 的登记选民参与了投票。那些认为健康的民主制度需要高投票率的人会把适龄人口或合格人口的投票率作为美国存在问题的证据。而那些认为只有知情且积极的公民才应该投票的人则会引用登记选民的投票率数据。然而，仅仅关注一个数字可能会产生误导。例如，如果比较 2024 年（84%）和 2020 年（77%）的已登记选民投票率，似乎投票率显著提高；然而，如果考察这两年符合投票资格的人口的投票率（2024 年为 64%，2020 年为 67%），就会发现事实并非如此。实际上，2024 年选举的投票总数减少了 340 多万张。因此，虽然 2024 年已登记选民的投票率高于 2020 年，但已登记选民的总数以及实际投票的总人数都远低于 2020 年 。26

WHAT FACTORS DRIVE VOTER TURNOUT?
影响选民投票率的因素有哪些？
Political parties and campaign managers approach every population of voters differently, based on what they know about factors that influence turnout. Everyone targets likely voters, which are the category of registered voters who vote regularly. Most campaigns also target registered voters in general, because they are more likely to vote than unregistered citizens. For this reason, many polling agencies ask respondents whether they are already registered and whether they voted in the last election. Those who are registered and did vote in the last election are likely to have a strong interest in politics and elections and will vote again, provided they are not angry with the political system or politicians.

[.my2]
政党和竞选经理会根据他们对影响投票率因素的了解，采取不同的策略来争取不同选民群体的支持。所有政党和竞选经理的目标群体都是“可能投票的选民”，也就是那些已登记且定期投票的选民。大多数竞选活动也会将目标群体扩大到已登记选民，因为他们比未登记的公民更有可能参与投票。因此，许多民调机构会询问受访者是否已登记以及是否参加了上次选举。那些已登记且参加了上次选举的选民通常对政治和选举抱有浓厚的兴趣，并且只要他们对政治体制或政治人物没有不满，他们再次投票的可能性就很大。

Some campaigns and civic groups target members of the voting-eligible population who are not registered, especially in states that are highly contested during a particular election. The Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), which is now defunct, was both lauded and criticized for its efforts to get voters in low socio-economic areas registered during the 2008 election.27 Similarly, interest groups in Los Angeles were criticized for registering homeless citizens as a part of an effort to gather signatures to place propositions on the ballot.28 These potential voters may not think they can vote, but they might be persuaded to register and then vote if the process is simplified or the information they receive encourages them to do so.

[.my2]
一些竞选活动和公民团体将目标锁定在符合投票资格但尚未登记的选民身上，尤其是在选举竞争激烈的州。现已解散的 “社区组织改革协会 ”（ACORN）因其在 2008 年大选期间努力帮助低收入社区选民进行登记而备受赞誉，但也饱受诟病。 27 同样，洛杉矶的一些利益集团也因登记无家可归者以收集签名将提案提交公投而受到批评。 28 这些潜在选民可能认为自己没有投票权，但如果登记流程简化或他们获得的信息能够鼓励他们这样做，他们或许会被说服进行登记并最终投票。

Campaigns also target different age groups with different intensity, because age is a relatively consistent factor in predicting voting behavior. Those between eighteen and twenty-five are least likely to vote, while those sixty-five to seventy-four are most likely. One reason for lower voter turnout among younger citizens may be that they move frequently.29 Another reason may be circular: Youth are less active in government and politics, leading the parties to neglect them. When people are neglected, they are in turn less likely to become engaged in government.30 They may also be unaware of what a government provides. Younger people are often still in college, perhaps working part-time and earning low wages. They are unlikely to be receiving government benefits beyond Pell Grants or government-subsidized tuition and loans. They are also unlikely to be paying taxes at a high rate. Government is a distant concept rather than a daily concern, which may drive down turnout.

[.my2]
竞选活动也会针对不同年龄段的人群采取不同的宣传力度，因为年龄是预测投票行为的一个相对稳定的因素。18 至 25 岁的人群投票率最低，而 65 至 74 岁的人群投票率最高。年轻公民投票率较低的原因之一可能是他们频繁搬家。 29 另一个原因可能是一个循环论证：年轻人参与政府和政治的积极性较低，导致各政党忽视他们。当人们被忽视时，他们参与政府事务的可能性自然也会降低。 30 他们也可能不了解政府提供的服务。年轻人通常还在上大学，可能兼职工作，收入不高。他们不太可能获得佩尔助学金或政府补贴的学费和贷款以外的政府福利。他们也不太可能缴纳高额税款。政府对他们来说是一个遥远的概念，而不是日常关注的问题，这可能导致投票率下降。

In 2016, for example, the Census Bureau reported that only 51 percent of eligible voters between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four registered and 39 percent voted, while 75 percent of sixty-five to seventy-four-year-olds registered and 68 percent voted.31 Once a person has retired, reliance on the government will grow if they draw income from Social Security, receive health care from Medicare, and enjoy benefits such as transportation and social services from state and local governments (Figure 7.7).

[.my2]
例如，2016 年人口普查局报告称，18 至 24 岁符合资格的选民中，只有 51%进行了选民登记，39%参与了投票；而 65 至 74 岁选民中，75%进行了选民登记，68%参与了投票。 31 一旦退休，如果一个人领取社会保障金、享受医疗保险，并享受州和地方政府提供的交通和社会服务等福利，那么他对政府的依赖性就会增加（ 图 7.7 ）。

Due to consistently low turnout among the young, several organizations have made special efforts to demonstrate to younger citizens that voting is an important activity. Rock the Vote began in 1990, with the goal of bringing music, art, and pop culture together to encourage the youth to participate in government. The organization hosts rallies, festivals, and concerts that also register voters and promote voter awareness, bringing celebrities and musicians to set examples of civic involvement. Rock the Vote also maintains a website that helps young adults find out how to register in their state. In 2018, former first lady Michelle Obama founded the organization "When We All Vote" to encourage voter registration and participation in the 2020 electoral process. Joining Obama as co-chairs on her "voting squad" were Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Selena Gomez, Faith Hill, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and Chris Paul. These efforts may indeed have helped increase turnout, as 2020 brought record levels of participation, despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. (Figure 7.8).32
由于年轻人的投票率一直很低，一些组织特别努力地向年轻公民展示投票的重要性。 “摇滚投票”（Rock the Vote） 成立于 1990 年，旨在将音乐、艺术和流行文化结合起来，鼓励年轻人参与政府事务。该组织举办集会、节日和音乐会，同时进行选民登记并提高选民意识，并邀请名人及音乐家以身作则，树立公民参与的榜样。“摇滚投票”还维护着一个网站，帮助年轻人了解如何在他们所在的州进行选民登记。2018 年，前第一夫人米歇尔·奥巴马创立了“人人投票”（When We All Vote）组织，旨在鼓励选民登记并参与 2020 年大选。与奥巴马共同担任其“投票小队”联合主席的还有汤姆·汉克斯、丽塔·威尔逊、赛琳娜·戈麦斯、菲丝·希尔、林-曼努埃尔·米兰达和克里斯·保罗。尽管面临新冠疫情的挑战，但这些努力可能确实有助于提高投票率，2020 年的投票率仍创下历史新高（ 图 7.8 ）。 32

Milestone  里程碑
Making a Difference  做出改变
In 2008, for the first time since 1972, a presidential candidate intrigued America’s youth and persuaded them to flock to the polls in record numbers. Barack Obama not only spoke to young people’s concerns but his campaign also connected with them via technology, wielding texts and tweets to bring together a new generation of voters (Figure 7.9).

[.my2]
2008 年，自 1972 年以来，首次有一位总统候选人引起了美国年轻人的兴趣，并说服他们踊跃投票，人数创下历史新高。巴拉克· 奥巴马不仅回应了年轻人的关切，他的竞选活动还通过科技与他们建立了联系，利用短信和推特等方式将新一代选民聚集在一起（ 图 7.9 ）。

The high level of interest Obama inspired among college-aged voters was a milestone in modern politics. Since the 1971 passage of the Twenty-Sixth Amendment, which lowered the voting age from 21 to 18, voter turnout in the under-25 range has been low. While opposition to the Vietnam War and the military draft sent 50.9 percent of 21- to 24-year-old voters to the polls in 1964, after 1972, turnout in that same age group dropped to below 40 percent as youth became disenchanted with politics. In 2008, however, it briefly increased to 45 percent from only 32 percent in 2000. Yet, despite high interest in Obama’s candidacy in 2008, younger voters were less enchanted in 2012—only 38 percent showed up to vote that year.33
奥巴马在大学年龄段选民中引发的高度关注是现代政治的一个里程碑。自 1971 年第二十六修正案通过，将投票年龄从 21 岁降至 18 岁以来，25 岁以下选民的投票率一直很低。1964 年，反对越南战争和征兵的呼声促使 50.9%的 21 至 24 岁选民参与投票，但 1972 年后，随着年轻人对政治感到失望，该年龄段的投票率下降到 40%以下。然而，2008 年，这一比例短暂回升至 45%，而 2000 年仅为 32%。尽管 2008 年奥巴马的竞选活动备受关注，但年轻选民在 2012 年的热情有所下降——当年只有 38%的年轻人参与了投票。 33

What qualities should a presidential or congressional candidate show in order to get college students excited and voting? Why?
总统或国会候选人应该展现哪些特质才能激发大学生的热情并促使他们投票？为什么？

Citizens’ socioeconomic status—the combination of education, income, and social status—may also predict whether they will vote. Among those who have completed college, the 2020 voter turnout rate jumps to 80 percent of eligible voters, compared to about 60 percent for those without a college degree.34 This is due in part to the powerful effect of education, one of the strongest predictors of voting turnout. Income also has a strong effect on the likelihood of voting. Citizens earning $150.000 a year or more are very likely to vote and over 80 percent of them do, while only 55 percent of those who earn $25,000 a year vote.35 Once high income and college education are combined, the resulting high socioeconomic status strongly predicts the likelihood that a citizen will vote.

[.my2]
公民的社会经济地位——教育程度、收入和社会地位的综合体现——也能预测他们是否会投票。在大学毕业生中，2020 年的投票率高达符合投票资格选民的 80%，而未获得大学学位的选民投票率约为 60%。 34 这部分归因于教育的强大影响，教育是投票率的最强预测因素之一。收入也对投票的可能性有显著影响。年收入 15 万美元或以上的公民极有可能投票，其中超过 80%的人会投票，而年收入 2.5 万美元的人只有 55%会投票。 35 高收入和大学教育相结合，由此产生的高社会经济地位能够有力地预测公民的投票可能性。

Race is also a factor. White people turn out to vote in the highest numbers, with 71 percent of non-Hispanic White citizens voting in 2020. In comparison, 63 percent of African Americans, 59 percent of Asian Americans, and 54 percent of Hispanic citizens voted in 2020. Voting turnout can increase or decrease based upon the political culture of a state, however. Hispanics, for example, often vote in higher numbers in states where there has historically been higher Hispanic involvement and representation, such as New Mexico, where 59 percent of Hispanic voters turned out in 2020.36 In 2016, while Donald Trump rode a wave of discontent among White voters to the presidency, the fact that Hillary Clinton nearly beat him may have had as much to do with the record turnout of Latinos in response to numerous remarks on immigration that Trump made throughout his campaign. Latinos made up 13 percent of the electorate in 2020, up from nearly 12 percent in 2016, and 10 percent in 2012.37
种族也是一个影响因素。白人的投票率最高，2020 年非西班牙裔白人公民的投票率为 71%。相比之下，非裔美国人的投票率为 63%，亚裔美国人为 59%，西班牙裔公民为 54%。然而，投票率会因各州的政治文化而有所波动。例如，在历史上西班牙裔参与度和代表性较高的州，西班牙裔的投票率通常也较高，例如新墨西哥州，2020 年该州 59%的西班牙裔选民参与了投票。 36 2016 年，唐纳德·特朗普凭借白人选民的不满情绪赢得了总统大选，而希拉里·克林顿几乎击败他，或许也与拉丁裔选民创纪录的投票率密切相关，因为特朗普在竞选期间发表了许多关于移民的言论。 2020 年，拉丁裔选民占总选民的 13%，高于 2016 年的近 12%和 2012 年的 10% 。37

While less of a factor today, gender has historically been a factor in voter turnout. After 1920, when the Nineteenth Amendment gave women the right to vote, women began slowly turning out to vote, and now they do so in high numbers. Today, more women vote than men. In 2016, a record 73.7 million women (63.3 percent) reporting voting, as compared to 63.8 million men (59.3 percent).38 While women do not vote exclusively for one political party, 41 percent are likely to identify as Democrats and only 25 percent are likely to identify as Republicans.39 The margin that Hillary Clinton won was more narrow in Florida than many presumed it would be and may have helped Donald Trump win that state. Even after allegations of sexual assault and revelations of several instances of sexism by Mr. Trump, Clinton only won 54 percent of the women’s vote in Florida. In contrast, rural voters voted overwhelmingly for Trump, at much higher rates than they had for Mitt Romney in 2012.

尽管如今性别对投票率的影响较小，但历史上性别一直是影响投票率的因素之一。1920 年，第十九修正案赋予女性投票权后，女性投票率开始缓慢上升，如今已大幅增长。目前，女性投票人数超过男性。2016 年，创纪录的 7370 万女性（占 63.3%）参与了投票，而男性投票人数为 6380 万（占 59.3%）。 38 虽然女性并非只投票给一个政党，但 41%的女性倾向于认同民主党，只有 25%的女性倾向于认同共和党。 39 希拉里·克林顿在佛罗里达州的胜选优势比许多人预想的要小，这可能帮助了唐纳德·特朗普赢得该州。即使在特朗普被指控性侵和多次性别歧视事件曝光之后，克林顿在佛罗里达州也只获得了 54%的女性选票。相比之下，农村选民绝大多数都投票支持特朗普，其支持率远高于 2012 年支持米特·罗姆尼的比例。

WHAT FACTORS DECREASE VOTER TURNOUT?
哪些因素会降低投票率？
Just as political scientists and campaign managers worry about who does vote, they also look at why people choose to stay home on Election Day. Over the years, studies have explored why a citizen might not vote. The reasons range from the obvious excuse of being too busy (19 percent) to more complex answers, such as transportation problems (3.3 percent) and restrictive registration laws (5.5 percent).40 With only 62 percent of our voting-age population (VAP) voting in the presidential election of 2020, however, we should examine why the rest do not participate.

正如政治学家和竞选经理们关注投票人数一样，他们也关注人们为何选择在选举日待在家中。多年来，研究一直在探讨公民不投票的原因。原因多种多样，从显而易见的“太忙”（19%）到更为复杂的解释，例如交通问题（3.3%）和限制性的选民登记法（ 5.5 %）。然而，在 2020 年总统选举中，只有 62%的适龄选民参与投票，因此我们应该探究其余选民不参与投​​票的原因。

One prominent reason for low national voter turnout is that participation is not mandated. Some countries, such as Belgium and Turkey, have compulsory voting laws, which require citizens to vote in elections or pay a fine. This helps the two countries attain VAP turnouts of 87 percent and 86 percent, respectively, compared to the U.S. turnout of 54 percent. Sweden and Germany automatically register their voters, and 83 percent and 66 percent vote, respectively. Chile’s decision to move from compulsory voting to voluntary voting caused a drop in participation from 87 percent to 46 percent.41
导致全国投票率低的一个主要原因是投票并非强制性的。一些国家，例如比利时和土耳其，实行强制投票法，要求公民必须参加选举，否则将被罚款。这使得这两个国家的投票率分别达到 87%和 86%，而美国的投票率仅为 54%。瑞典和德国实行选民自动登记制度，投票率分别为 83%和 66%。智利从强制投票改为自愿投票后，投票率从 87%下降到 46%。 41

Low turnout also occurs when some citizens are not allowed to vote. One method of limiting voter access is the requirement to show identification at polling places. Supporters of strict voter ID requirements argue that these restrictions are required to prevent fraud, such as casting multiple votes, and to maintain the integrity of election results. Opponents, however, claim there is little evidence that such fraud is taking place. Research into the effect of voter ID laws on voter turnout is equally split. Some studies have concluded that strict voter ID laws reduce turnout, especially among minority voters.42 Other studies have determined that such laws have little to no effect on turnout.43
当部分公民被剥夺投票权时，投票率也会降低。限制选民投票权的一种方法是要求选民在投票站出示身份证明。支持严格选民身份验证要求的人认为，这些限制是为了防止舞弊行为（例如多次投票），并维护选举结果的公正性。然而，反对者则声称几乎没有证据表明存在此类舞弊行为。关于选民身份验证法对投票率影响的研究结果不一。一些研究得出结论，严格的选民身份验证法会降低投票率，尤其是在少数族裔选民中。 42 而另一些研究则认为，此类法律对投票率几乎没有影响。 43

In 2005, the Indiana legislature passed the first strict photo identification law. Voters must provide photo identification that shows their names match the voter registration records, clearly displays an expiration date, is current or has expired only since the last general election, and was issued by the state of Indiana or the U.S. government. Student identification cards that meet the standards and are from an Indiana state school are allowed.44 Indiana’s law allows voters without an acceptable identification to obtain a free state identification card.45 The state also extended service hours for state offices that issue identification in the days leading up to elections.46
2005 年，印第安纳州议会通过了该州首部严格的带照片身份识别法。选民必须提供带照片的身份证明，该证明需显示其姓名与选民登记记录相符，清晰标明有效期，且必须是当前有效或仅在上届大选后过期，并由印第安纳州政府或美国联邦政府签发。符合标准的印第安纳州公立学校学生证亦可接受。 44 印第安纳州法律允许没有有效身份证明的选民免费获得州身份证。 45 该州还在选举前几天延长了负责签发身份证明的州政府机构的服务时间。 46

The photo identification law was quickly contested. The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups argued that it placed an unfair burden on people who were poor, older, or had limited finances, while the state argued that it would prevent fraud. In Crawford v. Marion County Election Board (2008), the Supreme Court decided that Indiana’s voter identification requirement was constitutional, although the decision left open the possibility that another case might meet the burden of proof required to overturn the law.47
这项选民身份识别法很快就遭到了质疑。 美国公民自由联盟和其他团体认为，该法给贫困、年老或经济拮据的人带来了不公平的负担，而州政府则辩称，该法可以防止舞弊。在克劳福德诉马里恩县选举委员会案 （2008 年）中，最高法院裁定印第安纳州的选民身份识别要求符合宪法，但该裁决并未排除其他案件可能达到推翻该法所需的举证责任的可能性 。47

In 2011, Texas passed a strict photo identification law for voters, allowing concealed-handgun permits as identification but not student identification. The Texas law was blocked by the Obama administration before it could be implemented, because Texas was on the Voting Rights Act’s preclearance list. Other states, such as Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, and Virginia similarly had laws and districting changes blocked.48 As a result, Shelby County, Alabama, and several other states sued the U.S. attorney general, arguing the Voting Rights Act’s preclearance list was unconstitutional and that the formula that determined whether states had violated the VRA was outdated. In Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Supreme Court agreed. In a 5–4 decision, the justices in the majority said the formula for placing states on the VRA preclearance list was outdated and reached into the states’ authority to oversee elections.49 States and counties on the preclearance list were released, and Congress was told to design new guidelines for placing states on the list.

2011 年，德克萨斯州通过了一项严格的选民照片身份识别法，允许使用隐蔽持枪许可证作为身份证明，但不允许使用学生证。由于德克萨斯州被列入《投票权法案》的预先审查名单，该法案在实施前遭到奥巴马政府的阻止。其他州，例如阿拉巴马州、阿拉斯加州、亚利桑那州、佐治亚州和弗吉尼亚州，也面临着类似的法律和选区划分变更被阻止的情况。 48 因此，阿拉巴马州谢尔比县和其他几个州起诉了美国司法部长，认为《投票权法案》的预先审查名单违宪，并且用于判定各州是否违反《投票权法案》的公式已经过时。在谢尔比县诉霍尔德案 （2013 年）中，最高法院支持了这一观点。在 5 比 4 的裁决中，多数大法官认为，将各州列入《投票权法案》预先审查名单的公式已经过时，并且侵犯了各州监督选举的权力。预先批准名单上的 49 个州和县被解除限制，国会被告知要制定新的指导方针，将各州列入名单。

Following the Shelby decision, Texas implemented its photo identification law, leading plaintiffs to bring cases against the state, charging that the law disproportionally affects minority voters.50 Alabama, Georgia, and Virginia similarly implemented their photo identification laws, joining Kansas, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. Some of these states offer low-cost or free identification for the purposes of voting or will offer help with the completion of registration applications, but citizens must provide birth certificates or other forms of identification, which can be difficult and/or costly to obtain.

[.my2]
在谢尔比案判决之后，德克萨斯州实施了照片身份识别法，导致原告对该州提起诉讼，指控该法对少数族裔选民造成了不成比例的影响。 阿拉巴马州、佐治亚州和弗吉尼亚州也相继实施了照片身份识别法，与堪萨斯州、南卡罗来纳州、田纳西州和威斯康星州并列。其中一些州提供低成本或免费的身份证明用于投票，或协助填写选民登记申请表，但公民必须提供出生证明或其他形式的身份证明，而这些证明的获取可能既困难又昂贵。

Opponents of photo identification laws argue that these restrictions are unfair because they have an unusually strong effect on some demographics. One study, done by Reuters, found that requiring a photo ID would disproportionally prevent citizens aged 18–24, Hispanics, and those without a college education from voting. These groups are unlikely to have the right paperwork or identification, unlike citizens who have graduated from college. The same study found that 4 percent of households with yearly incomes under $25,000 said they did not have an ID that would be considered valid for voting.51 For this reason, some assert that such changes tend to favor Republicans over Democrats. In the 2018 elections, there were controversial results and allegations of voter suppression in Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina, three jurisdictions where elections were very close.52 Additional allegations of voter suppression emerged in 2020 in many states, including Georgia and Texas. In some places in Georgia, voters had to wait for ten hours to cast their votes.53 In Texas, many drive-by voting stations employed during the primary election to assist with voting during COVID-19 were eliminated for the general election.54 In many states in 2021, policies were considered to further constrict voting, including Georgia's new law.

[.my2]
反对照片身份识别法的人士认为，这些限制不公平，因为它们对某些人群的影响异常强烈。路透社的一项研究发现，要求提供照片身份证会不成比例地阻止 18 至 24 岁的公民、西班牙裔以及未受过大学教育的人投票。与大学毕业生不同，这些群体不太可能拥有所需的证件或身份证明。同一项研究还发现，年收入低于 2.5 万美元的家庭中，有 4%表示他们没有可以用于投票的有效身份证件。 51 因此，一些人断言，此类改革往往更有利于共和党而非民主党。在 2018 年的选举中，佛罗里达州、佐治亚州和北卡罗来纳州这三个选情胶着的州出现了争议性的结果和选民压制的指控。 52 2020 年，包括佐治亚州和德克萨斯州在内的许多州再次出现选民压制的指控。在佐治亚州的一些地方，选民甚至需要等待十个小时才能投票。 53 在德克萨斯州，初选期间为应对新冠疫情而设立的许多免下车投票站，在大选中被取消了。54 2021 年，许多州都考虑出台政策进一步限制投票，包括佐治亚州的新法律。

Another reason for not voting is that polling places may be open only on Election Day. This makes it difficult for voters juggling school, work, and child care during polling hours (Figure 7.10). Many states have tried to address this problem with early voting, which opens polling places as much as two weeks early. Texas opened polling places on weekdays and weekends in 1988 and initially saw an increase in voting in gubernatorial and presidential elections, although the impact tapered off over time.55 Other states with early voting, however, showed a decline in turnout, possibly because there is less social pressure to vote when voting is spread over several days.56 Early voting was used in a widespread manner across forty-four states in 2020, totaling over 100 million votes cast in this manner.57
不投票的另一个原因是投票站可能只在选举日开放。这使得选民难以在投票期间兼顾上学、工作和照顾孩子（ 图 7.10 ）。许多州试图通过提前投票来解决这个问题，提前投票最多可提前两周开放投票站。德克萨斯州于 1988 年在工作日和周末开放了投票站，最初在州长和总统选举中投票率有所上升，但随着时间的推移，这种影响逐渐减弱。 55 然而，其他一些实行提前投票的州却出现了投票率下降的情况，这可能是因为投票分散在几天内，人们的社会投票压力较小。 56 2020 年，44 个州广泛采用了提前投票，通过这种方式投出的选票总数超过 1 亿张。 57

Figure 7.10 On February 5, 2008, dubbed “Super Duper Tuesday” by the press, twenty-four states held caucuses or primary elections—the largest simultaneous number of state presidential primary elections in U.S. history. As a result, over half the Democratic delegates were allocated unusually early in the election season. This polling station, on the Stanford University campus in Palo Alto, California, had long lines, commonly seen only on Election Day, and nearly ran out of Democratic ballots. (credit: Josh Thompson)
图 7.10 2008 年 2 月 5 日，媒体称之为“超级星期二”，当天有 24 个州举行了党团会议或初选——这是美国历史上同时举行州级总统初选数量最多的一次。因此，超过一半的民主党代表在选举季初期就被异常早地分配完毕。位于加州帕洛阿尔托斯坦福大学校园内的这个投票站排起了长队，这种情况通常只在选举日才会出现，而且民主党选票几乎售罄。（图片来源：Josh Thompson）
In a similar effort, Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah, and Washington have moved to mail-in voting systems.58 These states have seen a rise in turnout, with Colorado’s numbers increasing from 1.8 million votes in the 2010 congressional elections to 2.6 million votes in the 2018 congressional elections.59 , 60 One argument against early and mail-only voting is that those who vote early cannot change their minds during the final days of the campaign, such as in response to an “October surprise,” a highly negative story about a candidate that leaks right before Election Day in November. (For example, a week before the 2000 election, a Dallas Morning News journalist reported that George W. Bush had lied about whether he had been arrested for driving under the influence.61) In 2016, two such stories, one for each nominee, broke just prior to Election Day. First, the Billy Bush Access Hollywood tape showed a braggadocian Donald Trump detailing his ability to do what he pleases with women, including grabbing at their genitals. This tape led some Republican officeholders, such as Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ), to disavow Trump. However, perhaps eclipsing this episode was the release by former FBI director James Comey of a letter to Congress re-opening the Hillary Clinton email investigation a mere eleven days prior to the election. It is impossible to know the exact dynamics of how someone decides to vote, but one theory is that women jumped from Trump after the Access Hollywood tape emerged, only to go back to supporting him when the FBI seemed to reopen its investigation. Moreover, we later learned of significant Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Robert S. Mueller III, a well-respected former FBI director for presidents from both parties, was appointed as the independent special investigator to delve into matters related to the 2016 election and potential interaction between Russian actors and American election processes.62 That investigation led to a host of Trump campaign and Trump administration officials facing indictments and convictions, including his former campaign manager Paul Manafort, personal attorney Michael Cohen, and long-time confidant Roger Stone. To date, the former president has not faced charges.63 The 2020 elections, which saw record turnout despite the COVID-19 pandemic, were declared by election experts to be the safest and most carefully monitored elections in American history.64
科罗拉多州、夏威夷州、俄勒冈州、犹他州和华盛顿州也采取了类似的措施，转而采用邮寄投票系统。 58 这些州的投票率均有所上升，其中科罗拉多州的投票人数从 2010 年国会选举的 180 万张增加到 2018 年国会选举的 260 万张。 59 , 60 反对提前投票和邮寄投票的一个论点是，提前投票的选民无法在竞选的最后阶段改变主意，例如，在 11 月大选日临近之际，如果出现“十月惊奇”（即有关候选人的严重负面新闻泄露），他们就无法改变主意。（例如，在 2000 年大选前一周， 《达拉斯晨报》的一名记者报道称，乔治·W·布什就其是否因酒后驾车被捕一事撒了谎。 61 ）2016 年，两位候选人分别在大选日前夕遭遇了类似的负面新闻。首先，比利·布什曝光的“走进好莱坞”录音带显示，唐纳德·特朗普吹嘘自己可以随心所欲地对待女性，包括猥亵她们的私处。这段录音导致一些共和党官员，例如亚利桑那州参议员杰夫·弗莱克，公开与特朗普划清界限。然而，或许更引人注目的是，前联邦调查局局长詹姆斯·科米在选举前仅仅 11 天向国会发出了一封信，重启了对希拉里·克林顿邮件的调查。我们无法确切了解人们投票的决定因素，但一种理论认为，在“走进好莱坞”录音带曝光后，女性选民一度放弃支持特朗普，但当联邦调查局似乎重启调查时，她们又重新转而支持他。 此外，我们后来得知俄罗斯对 2016 年大选进行了重大干预。备受尊敬的前联邦调查局局长罗伯特·S·穆勒三世（曾为两党总统服务）被任命为独立特别调查员，负责深入调查与 2016 年大选相关的事件以及俄罗斯方面与美国选举进程之间可能存在的互动。 62 该调查导致多名特朗普竞选团队和特朗普政府官员面临起诉和定罪，其中包括他的前竞选经理保罗·马纳福特、私人律师迈克尔·科恩以及长期密友罗杰·斯通。迄今为止，这位前总统尚未受到任何指控。 63 尽管受到新冠疫情的影响，2020 年大选的投票率仍然创下纪录，选举专家称其为美国历史上最安全、监控最严密的选举。64

Apathy may also play a role. Some people avoid voting because their vote is unlikely to make a difference or the election is not competitive. If one party has a clear majority in a state or district, for instance, members of the minority party may see no reason to vote. Democrats in Utah and Republicans in California are so outnumbered that they are unlikely to affect the outcome of an election, and they may opt to stay home. Because the presidential candidate with the highest number of popular votes receives all of Utah’s and California’s electoral votes, there is little incentive for some citizens to vote: they will never change the outcome of the state-level election. These citizens, as well as those who vote for third parties like the Green Party or the Libertarian Party, are sometimes referred to as the chronic minority. While third-party candidates sometimes win local or state office or even dramatize an issue for national discussion, such as when Ross Perot discussed the national debt during his campaign as an independent presidential candidate in 1992, they never win national elections.

[.my2]
冷漠也可能是一个因素。有些人不投票，因为他们认为自己的选票不太可能产生影响，或者选举缺乏竞争。例如，如果一个政党在某个州或选区拥有绝对多数席位，那么少数党成员可能就觉得没有理由投票。犹他州的民主党人和加利福尼亚州的共和党人人数太少，不太可能影响选举结果，他们可能会选择待在家中。由于获得普选票最多的总统候选人将赢得犹他州和加利福尼亚州的全部选举人票，因此一些公民几乎没有投票的动力：他们永远无法改变州级选举的结果。这些公民，以及那些投票给绿党或自由党等第三方政党的公民，有时被称为“ 长期少数派” 。虽然第三方候选人有时能够赢得地方或州级公职，甚至能够将某些议题推向全国讨论的焦点，例如罗斯·佩罗在 1992 年作为独立总统候选人竞选期间就曾讨论过国家债务问题，但他们从未赢得过全国性选举。

Finally, some voters may view non-voting as a means of social protest or may see volunteering as a better way to spend their time. Younger voters are more likely to volunteer their time rather than vote, believing that serving others is more important than voting.65 Possibly related to this choice is voter fatigue. In many states, due to our federal structure with elections at many levels of government, voters may vote many times per year on ballots filled with candidates and issues to research. The less time there is between elections, the lower the turnout.66
最后，一些选民可能将不投票视为一种社会抗议手段，或者认为志愿服务是更有意义的消遣方式。年轻选民更倾向于参与志愿服务而非投票，他们认为服务他人比投票更重要。65 可能与此选择相关的还有选民疲劳 。在许多州，由于联邦制下各级政府都有选举，选民一年可能要多次投票 ， 而选票上充斥着候选人和各种议题，需要仔细研究。选举间隔时间越短，投票率就越低 。66
