== 释义





Turning a spoils system bureaucracy into a merit-based civil service, while desirable, comes with a number of different consequences. The patronage system tied the livelihoods of civil service workers to their party loyalty and discipline. Severing these ties, as has occurred in the United States over the last century and a half, has transformed the way bureaucracies operate. Without the patronage network, bureaucracies form their own motivations. These motivations, sociologists have discovered, are designed to benefit and perpetuate the bureaucracies themselves.

将裙带关系式的官僚机构转变为以功绩为基础的公务员制度，虽然可取，但也会带来诸多不同的后果。裙带关系将公务员的生计与其党派忠诚和纪律紧密相连。过去一个半世纪以来，美国已经切断了这种联系，彻底改变了官僚机构的运作方式。没有了裙带关系网络，官僚机构便会形成自身的运作动机。社会学家发现，这些动机旨在维护和延续官僚机构自身的利益。

MODELS OF BUREAUCRACY  官僚机构模式
Bureaucracies are complex institutions designed to accomplish specific tasks. This complexity, and the fact that they are organizations composed of human beings, can make it challenging for us to understand how bureaucracies work. Sociologists, however, have developed a number of models for understanding the process. Each model highlights specific traits that help explain the organizational behavior of governing bodies and associated functions.

[.my2]
官僚机构是为完成特定任务而设计的复杂组织。这种复杂性，以及它们是由人组成的这一事实，使得我们难以理解官僚机构的运作方式。然而，社会学家已经发展出许多模型来理解这一过程。每个模型都强调了有助于解释管理机构及其相关职能的组织行为的特定特征。

The Weberian Model  韦伯模型
The classic model of bureaucracy is typically called the ideal Weberian model, and it was developed by Max Weber, an early German sociologist. Weber argued that the increasing complexity of life would simultaneously increase the demands of citizens for government services. Therefore, the ideal type of bureaucracy, the Weberian model, was one in which agencies are apolitical, hierarchically organized, and governed by formal procedures. Furthermore, specialized bureaucrats would be better able to solve problems through logical reasoning. Such efforts would eliminate entrenched patronage, stop problematic decision-making by those in charge, provide a system for managing and performing repetitive tasks that required little or no discretion, impose order and efficiency, create a clear understanding of the service provided, reduce arbitrariness, ensure accountability, and limit discretion.22
官僚机构的经典模式通常被称为理想的韦伯模式 ，它由德国早期社会学家马克斯·韦伯提出。韦伯认为，生活日益复杂化，公民对政府服务的需求也会随之增加。因此，理想的官僚机构，即韦伯模式，其特点是机构不涉政治、层级分明、并受正式程序约束。此外，专业化的官僚机构能够更好地运用逻辑推理解决问题。这些努力将消除根深蒂固的裙带关系，阻止负责人做出不当决策，提供一个管理和执行重复性任务（几乎不需要或完全不需要自由裁量权）的系统，从而建立秩序和提高效率，使公众对所提供的服务有清晰的了解，减少任意性，确保问责制，并限制自由裁量权。 22

The Acquisitive Model  获取型模型
For Weber, as his ideal type suggests, the bureaucracy was not only necessary but also a positive human development. Later sociologists have not always looked so favorably upon bureaucracies, and they have developed alternate models to explain how and why bureaucracies function. One such model is called the acquisitive model of bureaucracy. The acquisitive model proposes that bureaucracies are naturally competitive and power-hungry. This means bureaucrats, especially at the highest levels, recognize that limited resources are available to feed bureaucracies, so they will work to enhance the status of their own bureaucracy to the detriment of others.

[.my2]
韦伯认为，正如他理想中的官僚机构所暗示的那样，官僚机构不仅是必要的，而且是人类发展的积极因素。然而，后来的社会学家并非总是对官僚机构持如此积极的态度，他们发展出了其他模型来解释官僚机构的运作方式和原因。其中一种模型被称为官僚机构的攫取型模型 。该模型认为，官僚机构天生具有竞争性和权力欲。这意味着官僚，尤其是高层官僚，意识到可用于维持官僚机构运转的资源有限，因此他们会不惜损害其他官僚机构的利益，努力提升自身官僚机构的地位。

This effort can sometimes take the form of merely emphasizing to Congress the value of their bureaucratic task, but it also means the bureaucracy will attempt to maximize its budget by depleting all its allotted resources each year. This ploy makes it more difficult for legislators to cut the bureaucracy’s future budget, a strategy that succeeds at the expense of thrift. In this way, the bureaucracy will eventually grow far beyond what is necessary and create bureaucratic waste that would otherwise be spent more efficiently among the other bureaucracies.

[.my2]
这种努力有时可能仅仅表现为向国会强调其官僚机构工作的价值，但也意味着官僚机构会试图通过每年耗尽所有分配资源来最大化其预算。这种策略使得立法者更难削减官僚机构未来的预算，而这种策略的成功是以牺牲节约为代价的。如此一来，官僚机构最终会膨胀到远远超出必要的程度，并造成本可以更有效地分配给其他官僚机构的浪费。

The Monopolistic Model  垄断模型
Other theorists have come to the conclusion that the extent to which bureaucracies compete for scarce resources is not what provides the greatest insight into how a bureaucracy functions. Rather, it is the absence of competition. The model that emerged from this observation is the monopolistic model.

[.my2]
其他理论家则得出结论：官僚机构争夺稀缺资源的程度并非揭示其运作方式的关键所在，相反，缺乏竞争才是关键。基于此观察而产生的模型便是垄断模型 。

Proponents of the monopolistic model recognize the similarities between a bureaucracy like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and a private monopoly like a regional power company or internet service provider that has no competitors. Such organizations are frequently criticized for waste, poor service, and a low level of client responsiveness. Consider, for example, the Bureau of Consular Affairs (BCA), the federal bureaucracy charged with issuing passports to citizens. There is no other organization from which a U.S. citizen can legitimately request and receive a passport, a process that normally takes ten to twelve weeks, unless one pays the higher expedited fee, which will make it four to six weeks.23 Thus there is no reason for the BCA to become more efficient or more responsive or to issue passports any faster.

[.my2]
垄断模式的支持者认为，像美国国税局（IRS）这样的官僚机构与像区域电力公司或互联网服务提供商这样没有竞争对手的私营垄断企业存在相似之处。这类机构经常因浪费、服务差劲和客户响应速度慢而受到批评。例如，领事事务局（BCA）是负责向公民签发护照的联邦官僚机构。美国公民无法通过其他任何机构合法申请和获得护照，通常需要十到十二周的时间，除非支付更高的加急费用，这样只需四到六周 。 因此，领事事务局没有理由提高效率、加快响应速度或加快护照签发速度。

There are rare bureaucratic exceptions that typically compete for presidential favor, most notably organizations such as the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and the intelligence agencies in the Department of Defense. Apart from these, bureaucracies have little reason to become more efficient or responsive, nor are they often penalized for chronic inefficiency or ineffectiveness. Therefore, there is little reason for them to adopt cost-saving or performance measurement systems. While some economists argue that the problems of government could be easily solved if certain functions are privatized to reduce this prevailing incompetence, bureaucrats are not as easily swayed.

[.my2]
极少数官僚机构会竞相争取总统的青睐，其中最引人注目的是中央情报局、国家安全局以及国防部下属的情报机构。除此之外，官僚机构几乎没有动力提高效率或响应速度，也很少会因长期效率低下或效力不足而受到惩罚。因此，它们几乎没有理由采用节约成本或绩效考核体系。尽管一些经济学家认为，如果将某些职能私有化以减少这种普遍存在的无能现象，政府问题就能迎刃而解，但官僚们却并非那么容易被说服。

TYPES OF BUREAUCRATIC ORGANIZATIONS
官僚机构的类型
A bureaucracy is a particular government unit established to accomplish a specific set of goals and objectives as authorized by a legislative body. In the United States, the federal bureaucracy enjoys a great degree of autonomy compared to those of other countries. This is in part due to the sheer size of the federal budget, approximately $4.48 trillion as of 2019.24 And because many of its agencies do not have clearly defined lines of authority—roles and responsibilities established by means of a chain of command—they also are able to operate with a high degree of autonomy. However, many agency actions are subject to judicial review. In Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States (1935), the Supreme Court found that agency authority seemed limitless.25 Yet, not all bureaucracies are alike. In the U.S. government, there are four general types: cabinet departments, independent executive agencies, regulatory agencies, and government corporations.

[.my2]
官僚机构是指为完成立法机构授权的特定目标和任务而设立的政府部门。在美国，联邦官僚机构相比其他国家享有高度自主权。这部分是由于联邦预算规模庞大，截至 2019 年约为 4.48 万亿美元。 24 而且，由于许多机构没有明确的职权范围——即通过指挥链确立的角色和职责——它们也能够高度自主地运作。然而，许多机构的行为都受到司法审查。在 “谢克特家禽公司诉美国案” （1935 年）中，最高法院认为机构的权力似乎没有上限。 25 然而，并非所有官僚机构都相同。在美国政府中，官僚机构大致可分为四类：内阁部门、独立行政机构、监管机构和政府公司。

Cabinet Departments  内阁部门
There are currently fifteen cabinet departments in the federal government. Cabinet departments are major executive offices that are directly accountable to the president. They include the Departments of State, Defense, Education, Treasury, and several others. Occasionally, a department will be eliminated when government officials decide its tasks no longer need direct presidential and congressional oversight, such as happened to the Post Office Department in 1970.

[.my2]
目前美国联邦政府共有十五个内阁部门。内阁部门是直接向总统负责的主要行政机构，包括国务院、国防部、教育部、财政部等。有时，当政府官员认为某个部门的职责不再需要总统和国会的直接监督时，该部门就会被撤销，例如1970年邮政部就被撤销了。

Each cabinet department has a head called a secretary, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. These secretaries report directly to the president, and they oversee a huge network of offices and agencies that make up the department. They also work in different capacities to achieve each department’s mission-oriented functions. Within these large bureaucratic networks are a number of undersecretaries, assistant secretaries, deputy secretaries, and many others. The Department of Justice is the one department that is structured somewhat differently. Rather than a secretary and undersecretaries, it has an attorney general, an associate attorney general, and a host of different bureau and division heads (Table 15.2).

[.my2]
每个内阁部门都有一位部长，由总统任命，参议院确认。这些部长直接向总统汇报工作，并负责监管构成该部门的庞大办公室和机构网络。他们还承担不同的职责，以实现各部门的既定目标。在这些庞大的官僚网络中，还有许多副部长、助理部长、副部长以及其他职位。司法部的结构略有不同。它没有部长和副部长，而是由司法部长、副司法部长以及众多不同的局长和处长组成（ 表 15.2 ）。

表 15.2 本表列出了所有当前的内阁部门，以及它们的创建年份、现任最高行政长官和与其宗旨和职能相关的其他特殊细节。
Individual cabinet departments are composed of numerous levels of bureaucracy. These levels descend from the department head in a mostly hierarchical pattern and consist of essential staff, smaller offices, and bureaus. Their tiered, hierarchical structure allows large bureaucracies to address many different issues by deploying dedicated and specialized officers. For example, below the secretary of state are a number of undersecretaries. These include undersecretaries for political affairs, for management, for economic growth, energy, and the environment, and many others. Each controls a number of bureaus and offices. Each bureau and office in turn oversees a more focused aspect of the undersecretary’s field of specialization (Figure 15.8). For example, below the undersecretary for public diplomacy and public affairs are three bureaus: educational and cultural affairs, public affairs, and international information programs. Frequently, these bureaus have even more specialized departments under them. Under the bureau of educational and cultural affairs are the spokesperson for the Department of State and that spokesperson's staff, the Office of the Historian, and the United States Diplomacy Center.26
各个内阁部门由多个层级的官僚机构组成。这些层级大多以等级制形式从部门首长向下延伸，包括核心工作人员、小型办公室和局。这种分层式的官僚机构通过部署专职和专业官员来处理各种不同的问题。例如，国务卿之下有若干副国务卿，包括负责政治事务、管理、经济增长、能源和环境等的副国务卿。每位副国务卿都管辖若干局和办公室。每个局和办公室又分别负责副国务卿专业领域内更具体的方面（ 图 15.8 ）。例如，负责公共外交和公共事务的副国务卿之下有三个局：教育和文化事务局、公共事务局和国际信息项目局。通常，这些局下辖更专业的部门。教育文化事务局下辖国务院发言人及其幕僚、历史学家办公室和美国外交中心 。26

Created in 1939 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to help manage the growing responsibilities of the White House, the Executive Office of the President still works today to “provide the President with the support that he or she needs to govern effectively.”
总统行政办公室由富兰克林·罗斯福总统于 1939 年创立，旨在帮助管理白宫日益增长的职责。时至今日，总统行政办公室仍然致力于“为总统提供有效执政所需的各种支持”。

Independent Executive Agencies and Regulatory Agencies
独立执行机构和监管机构
Like cabinet departments, independent executive agencies report directly to the president, with heads appointed by the president. Unlike the larger cabinet departments, however, independent agencies are assigned far more focused tasks. These agencies are considered independent because they are not subject to the regulatory authority of any specific department. They perform vital functions and are a major part of the bureaucratic landscape of the United States. Some prominent independent agencies are the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which collects and manages intelligence vital to national interests, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), charged with developing technological innovation for the purposes of space exploration (Figure 15.9), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which enforces laws aimed at protecting environmental sustainability.

[.my2]
与内阁部门一样，独立行政机构直接向总统汇报工作，其负责人由总统任命。然而，与规模更大的内阁部门不同，独立机构的任务更为专一。这些机构之所以被认为是独立的，是因为它们不受任何特定部门的监管。它们履行着至关重要的职能，是美国官僚体系的重要组成部分。一些著名的独立机构包括：中央情报局（CIA），负责收集和管理对国家利益至关重要的情报；国家航空航天局（NASA），负责为太空探索开发技术创新（ 图 15.9 ）；以及环境保护署（EPA），负责执行旨在保护环境可持续性的法律。

An important subset of the independent agency category is the regulatory agency. Regulatory agencies emerged in the late nineteenth century as a product of the progressive push to control the benefits and costs of industrialization. The first regulatory agency was the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), charged with regulating that most identifiable and prominent symbol of nineteenth-century industrialism, the railroad. Other regulatory agencies, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates U.S. financial markets and the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates radio and television, have largely been created in the image of the ICC. These independent regulatory agencies cannot be influenced as readily by partisan politics as typical agencies and can therefore develop a good deal of power and authority. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) illustrates well the potential power of such agencies. The SEC’s mission has expanded significantly in the digital era beyond mere regulation of stock floor trading.

[.my2]
独立机构类别中的一个重要子集是监管机构。监管机构兴起于 19 世纪末，是当时社会进步人士为控制工业化带来的收益和成本而推动的产物。第一个监管机构是州际商务委员会（ICC），其职责是监管 19 世纪工业化最显著的象征——铁路。其他监管机构，例如监管美国金融市场的商品期货交易委员会（CFTC）和监管广播电视的联邦通信委员会（FCC），在很大程度上都是以州际商务委员会为蓝本建立的。这些独立的监管机构不像其他机构那样容易受到党派政治的影响，因此能够发展出相当大的权力和权威。美国证券交易委员会（SEC）很好地体现了这类机构的潜在权力。在数字时代，SEC 的职责范围已显著扩大，不再局限于监管股票交易。

Government Corporations  政府公司
Agencies formed by the federal government to administer a quasi-business enterprise are called government corporations. They exist because the services they provide are partly subject to market forces and tend to generate enough profit to be self-sustaining, but they also fulfill a vital service the government has an interest in maintaining. Unlike a private corporation, a government corporation does not have stockholders. Instead, it has a board of directors and managers. This distinction is important because whereas a private corporation’s profits are distributed as dividends, a government corporation’s profits are dedicated to perpetuating the enterprise. Unlike private businesses, which pay taxes to the federal government on their profits, government corporations are exempt from taxes.

[.my2]
联邦政府为管理准商业企业而设立的机构被称为政府公司 。 它们之所以存在，是因为它们提供的服务部分受市场力量支配，往往能够产生足够的利润以维持自身运营，同时它们也履行着政府希望维持的重要服务。与私营公司不同，政府公司没有股东。取而代之的是，它由董事会和管理层组成。这一区别至关重要，因为私营公司的利润以股息的形式分配，而政府公司的利润则用于维持企业的持续发展。与需要向联邦政府缴纳利润税的私营企业不同，政府公司免税。

The most widely used government corporation is the U.S. Postal Service. Once a cabinet department, it was transformed into a government corporation in the early 1970s. While government corporations are supposed to operate more independently from politics and more like a business, the USPS recently found itself in the middle of a political firestorm. At the center was President Trump's postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, who became a lightning rod during the election. Depending on whom you talked to, DeJoy was either a well-qualified corporate executive from the logistics sector or a Republican operative aiming to slow down mail service.27 DeJoy reduced workloads, in particular overtime, removed sorting machines, and removed members of the postal leadership—leading to a slowing down of mail service. DeJoy insists that the changes will help the USPS in the long run.28
美国邮政服务（USPS）是使用最广泛的政府机构。它曾是内阁部门，于 20 世纪 70 年代初转型为政府机构。虽然政府机构理应更加独立于政治运作，更像一家企业，但 USPS 最近却陷入了一场政治风暴的中心。风暴的中心人物是特朗普总统任命的邮政局长路易斯·德乔伊，他在选举期间成为了众矢之的。根据你询问的对象不同， 德乔伊要么是一位来自物流行业的资深企业高管，要么是一位旨在减缓邮件服务的共和党特工。27 德乔伊减少了工作量，特别是加班时间，拆除了分拣机，并撤换了邮政领导层成员——这些都导致了邮件服务速度的下降。德乔伊坚称，从长远来看，这些改革将有利于 USPS 的发展 。28

Another widely used government corporation is the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, which uses the trade name Amtrak (Figure 15.10). Amtrak was the government’s response to the decline in passenger rail travel in the 1950s and 1960s as the automobile came to dominate. Recognizing the need to maintain a passenger rail service despite dwindling profits, the government consolidated the remaining lines and created Amtrak.29
另一个被广泛使用的政府公司是国家铁路客运公司（National Railroad Passenger Corporation），其商业名称为 Amtrak（ 图 15.10 ）。20 世纪 50 年代和 60 年代，随着汽车的兴起，客运铁路旅行逐渐衰落，Amtrak 正是政府为应对这一局面而成立的。政府意识到尽管利润不断减少，但仍有必要维持客运铁路服务，于是整合了剩余的线路，创建了 Amtrak。 29

THE FACE OF DEMOCRACY
民主的面孔
Those who work for the public bureaucracy are nearly always citizens, much like those they serve. As such they typically seek similar long-term goals from their employment, namely to be able to pay their bills and save for retirement. However, unlike those who seek employment in the private sector, public bureaucrats tend to have an additional motivator, the desire to accomplish something worthwhile on behalf of their country. In general, individuals attracted to public service display higher levels of public service motivation (PSM). This is a desire most people possess in varying degrees that drives us to seek fulfillment through doing good and contributing in an altruistic manner.30
在公共部门工作的人员几乎都是公民，就像他们所服务的民众一样。因此，他们通常对工作的长期目标也类似，即能够支付账单并为退休储蓄。然而，与那些在私营部门寻求就业机会的人不同，公共部门官员往往还有额外的动力，那就是为国家做出有价值的贡献。一般来说，那些被公共服务吸引的人表现出更高的公共服务动机（PSM）。这是一种大多数人或多或少都拥有的愿望，它驱使我们通过行善和以利他主义的方式做出贡献来寻求满足感 。30

Insider Perspective  内部视角
Dogs and Fireplugs  狗和消防栓
In Caught between the Dog and the Fireplug, or How to Survive Public Service (2001), author Kenneth Ashworth provides practical advice for individuals pursuing a career in civil service.31 Through a series of letters, Ashworth shares his personal experience and professional expertise on a variety of issues with a relative named Kim who is about to embark upon an occupation in the public sector. By discussing what life is like in the civil service, Ashworth provides an “in the trenches” vantage point on public affairs. He goes on to discuss hot topics centering on bureaucratic behaviors, such as (1) having sound etiquette, ethics, and risk aversion when working with press, politicians, and unpleasant people; (2) being a subordinate while also delegating; (3) managing relationships, pressures, and influence; (4) becoming a functional leader; and (5) taking a multidimensional approach to addressing or solving complex problems.

[.my2]
在 《进退维谷：如何在公共服务中生存》（2001）一书中， 作者肯尼斯· 阿什沃思为那些立志从事公务员职业的人士提供了切实可行的建议。 31 阿什沃思通过一系列信件，与即将进入公共部门工作的亲戚金分享了他个人的经历和专业知识，探讨了各种问题。通过描述公务员生活的方方面面，阿什沃思为读者提供了一个“身临其境”的公共事务视角。他还讨论了围绕官僚行为的热门话题，例如：（1）在与媒体、政客和难相处的人打交道时，如何保持良好的礼仪、职业道德和规避风险；（2）如何在做好下属的同时进行授权；（3）如何处理人际关系、压力和影响力；（4）如何成为一名高效的领导者；以及（5）如何运用多维度的方法来处理或解决复杂问题。

Ashworth says that politicians and civil servants differ in their missions, needs, and motivations, which will eventually reveal differences in their respective characters and, consequently, present a variety of challenges. He maintains that good civil servants must realize they will need to be in the thick of things to provide preeminent service without actually being seen as merely a bureaucrat. Put differently, a bureaucrat walks a fine line between standing up for elected officials and their respective policies—the dog—and at the same time acting in the best interest of the public—the fireplug.

[.my2]
阿什沃思指出，政治家和公务员在使命、需求和动机上存在差异，这最终会暴露出他们各自性格上的差异，并因此带来各种挑战。他认为，优秀的公务员必须意识到，他们需要深入基层，才能提供卓越的服务，同时又不被视为仅仅是官僚。换句话说，公务员需要在维护民选官员及其政策（如同“狗”）和维护公众利益（如同“消防栓”）之间小心翼翼地保持平衡。

In what ways is the problem identified by author Kenneth Ashworth a consequence of the merit-based civil service?
作者肯尼斯·阿什沃思指出的问题在哪些方面是公务员制度（以择优录取为基础）的后果？

Bureaucrats must implement and administer a wide range of policies and programs as established by congressional acts or presidential orders. Depending upon the agency’s mission, a bureaucrat’s roles and responsibilities vary greatly, from regulating corporate business and protecting the environment to printing money and purchasing office supplies. Bureaucrats are government officials subject to legislative regulations and procedural guidelines. Because they play a vital role in modern society, they hold managerial and functional positions in government; they form the core of most administrative agencies. Although many top administrators are far removed from the masses, many interact with citizens on a regular basis.

[.my2]
公务员必须执行和管理国会法案或总统令所制定的各项政策和计划。根据机构的使命，公务员的角色和职责差异很大，从监管企业业务和保护环境到印钞和采购办公用品，无所不包。公务员是受法律法规和程序准则约束的政府官员。由于他们在现代社会中扮演着至关重要的角色，因此他们在政府中担任管理和职能职位；他们构成了大多数行政机构的核心。尽管许多高级行政人员与普通民众相距甚远，但也有许多人定期与公民互动。

Given the power bureaucrats have to adopt and enforce public policy, they must follow several legislative regulations and procedural guidelines. A regulation is a rule that permits government to restrict or prohibit certain behaviors among individuals and corporations. Bureaucratic rulemaking is a complex process that will be covered in more detail in the following section, but the rulemaking process typically creates procedural guidelines, or more formally, standard operating procedures. These are the rules that lower-level bureaucrats must abide by regardless of the situations they face.

[.my2]
鉴于官僚机构拥有制定和执行公共政策的权力，他们必须遵守若干法律法规和程序准则。 法规是指允许政府限制或禁止个人和企业某些行为的规则。官僚机构的规则制定过程十分复杂，将在下一节中详细介绍。但规则制定过程通常会产生程序准则 ，或者更正式地说， 是标准操作程序 。这些规则是基层官僚无论面临何种情况都必须遵守的。

Elected officials are regularly frustrated when bureaucrats seem not follow the path they intended. As a result, the bureaucratic process becomes inundated with red tape. This is the name for the procedures and rules that must be followed to get something done. Citizens frequently criticize the seemingly endless networks of red tape they must navigate in order to effectively utilize bureaucratic services, although these devices are really meant to ensure the bureaucracies function as intended.

[.my2]
当官僚机构似乎没有按照他们预想的方式行事时，民选官员常常感到沮丧。结果，官僚程序变得繁文缛节过多。 “繁文缛节” 指的是完成某项工作必须遵循的程序和规则。公民经常批评他们为了有效利用官僚机构的服务而不得不应对看似无穷无尽的繁文缛节网络，尽管这些机制的真正目的是为了确保官僚机构按预期运作。
