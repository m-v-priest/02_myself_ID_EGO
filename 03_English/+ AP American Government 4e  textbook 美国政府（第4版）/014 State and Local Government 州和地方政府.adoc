== 释义


Controversial national policy decisions by lawmakers and justices tend to grab headlines and dominate social media, while state and local government matters often evoke less enthusiasm. Yet, if we think about which level of government most directly affects us on a daily basis, it is undoubtedly the level closest to us, including our city, county, school districts, and state government. Whether it is by maintaining roads we drive on each day, supplying clean water with which we brush our teeth, or allocating financial support to higher education, state and local government provides resources that shape our everyday lives, including your final tuition bill (Figure 14.1).

立法者和法官们做出的颇具争议的国家政策决定往往能占据新闻头条，并在社交媒体上引发热议，而州和地方政府事务则常常鲜少引起关注。然而，如果我们思考一下哪个层级的政府对我们的日常生活影响最大，毫无疑问是离我们最近的层级，包括我们所在的城市、县、学区和州政府。无论是维护我们每天行驶的道路，提供我们刷牙所需的清洁用水，还是为高等教育提供财政支持，州和地方政府提供的资源都塑造着我们的日常生活，包括你最终的学费账单（ 图 14.1 ）。

How do state and local governments gain the authority to make these decisions, and how are their actions guided by cultural and other differences between the states? What tensions exist between national and state governments on policy matters, and what unique powers do mayors and governors enjoy? By answering these and other questions, this chapter explores the role of state and local governments in our lives.
