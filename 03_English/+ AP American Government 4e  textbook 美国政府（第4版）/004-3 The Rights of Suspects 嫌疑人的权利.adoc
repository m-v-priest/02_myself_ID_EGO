== 释义



In addition to protecting the personal freedoms of individuals, the Bill of Rights protects those suspected or accused of crimes from various forms of unfair or unjust treatment. The prominence of these protections in the Bill of Rights may seem surprising. Given the colonists’ experience of what they believed to be unjust rule by British authorities, however, and the use of the legal system to punish rebels and their sympathizers for political offenses, the impetus to ensure fair, just, and impartial treatment to everyone accused of a crime—no matter how unpopular—is perhaps more understandable. What is more, the revolutionaries, and the eventual framers of the Constitution, wanted to keep the best features of English law as well.

[.my2]
**除了保护个人自由外， 《权利法案 》还保护被怀疑或被指控犯罪的人, 免受各种形式的不公平或不公正待遇。这些保护措施在《权利法案》中的突出地位, 或许令人惊讶。然而，考虑到殖民者曾亲身经历过他们认为英国当局的不公正统治，以及法律体系被用来惩罚叛乱者及其同情者的政治罪行，确保所有被指控犯罪的人——无论其罪行多么不得人心——都能得到公平、公正和不偏不倚的对待，这种动力或许更容易理解。**此外，革命者以及最终的宪法制定者, 也希望保留英国法律中最优秀的部分。

In addition to the protections outlined in the Fourth Amendment, which largely pertain to investigations conducted before someone has been charged with a crime, the next four amendments pertain to those suspected, accused, or convicted of crimes, as well as people engaged in other legal disputes. At every stage of the legal process, the Bill of Rights incorporates protections for these people.

[.my2]
除了第四修正案中概述的保护措施（主要涉及在某人被指控犯罪之前进行的调查）之外，接下来的四项修正案, 则涉及犯罪嫌疑人、被指控人, 或已被定罪的人，以及其他法律纠纷中的当事人。*在法律程序的每个阶段，《权利法案》都包含了对这些人提供的保护。*

=== THE FIFTH AMENDMENT

[.my2]
第五修正案


Many of the provisions dealing with the rights of the accused are included in the Fifth Amendment; accordingly, it is one of the longest in the Bill of Rights. The Fifth Amendment states in full:

[.my2]
许多有关"被告权利"的条款都, 包含在第五修正案中；因此，它是权利法案中最长的修正案之一。第五修正案全文如下：

“No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.”

[.my2]
“任何人不得因死罪或其他重罪, 被追究责任，除非经'大陪审团'提出控告或起诉，但陆军、海军或民兵, 在战时或公共危险时期实际服役时发生的案件除外；**任何人不得因同一罪行, 两次遭受生命或肢体危险；任何人不得在任何刑事案件中, 被迫"自证其罪"；任何人不得未经正当法律程序, 而被剥夺生命、自由或财产；任何人不得未经公平补偿, 而被征用私人财产用于公共用途。**”

The first clause requires that serious crimes be prosecuted only after an indictment has been issued by a grand jury. However, several exceptions are permitted as a result of the evolving interpretation and understanding of this amendment by the courts, given the Constitution is a living document. First, the courts have generally found this requirement to apply only to felonies; less serious crimes can be tried without a grand jury proceeding. Second, this provision of the Bill of Rights does not apply to the states because it has not been incorporated; many states instead require a judge to hold a preliminary hearing to decide whether there is enough evidence to hold a full trial. Finally, members of the armed forces who are accused of crimes are not entitled to a grand jury proceeding.

[.my2]
第一条规定，只有在"大陪审团"发出"起诉书"后，才能对严重犯罪提起诉讼。然而，鉴于宪法是一部与时俱进的文件，随着法院对该修正案的解释和理解不断演变，也允许存在一些例外情况。首先，法院通常认为, 这项要求仅适用于"重罪"；较轻的犯罪无需经过大陪审团程序, 即可审理。其次，由于该条款尚未被纳入宪法，因此不适用于各州；许多州要求法官举行"预审听证会"，以决定是否有足够的证据进行全面审判。最后，*被控犯罪的现役军人, 无权要求"大陪审团"审理。*

The Fifth Amendment also protects individuals against double jeopardy, a process that subjects a suspect to prosecution twice for the same criminal act. No one who has been acquitted (found not guilty) of a crime can be prosecuted again for that crime. But the prohibition against double jeopardy has its own exceptions. The most notable is that it prohibits a second prosecution only at the same level of government (federal or state) as the first; the federal government can try you for violating federal law, even if a state or local court finds you not guilty of the same action. For example, in the early 1990s, several Los Angeles police officers accused of brutally beating motorist Rodney King during his arrest were acquitted of various charges in a state court, but some were later convicted in a federal court of violating King’s civil rights.

[.my2]
第五修正案也保护个人免受双重危险 ，即同一犯罪行为,导致嫌疑人被起诉两次。**任何人一旦被判无罪（即被判无罪），就不能再因同一罪行被起诉。#但"禁止双重危险"的规定也有例外。最显著的例外是，它仅禁止在同一层级的政府（联邦或州）进行第二次起诉；即使州或地方法院已裁定你无罪，联邦政府仍可以就你违反联邦法律的行为对你进行审判。#**例如，在 20 世纪 90 年代初，几名被控在逮捕过程中殴打驾车者罗德尼 ·金的洛杉矶警察，在"州法院"被判无罪，但其中一些人后来在"联邦法院"被判侵犯金的公民权利罪名成立。

The double jeopardy rule does not prevent someone from recovering damages in a civil case—a legal dispute between individuals over a contract or compensation for an injury—that results from a criminal act, even if the person accused of that act is found not guilty. One famous case from the 1990s involved former football star and television personality O. J. Simpson. Simpson, although acquitted of the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman in a criminal court, was later found to be responsible for their deaths in a subsequent civil case and as a result was forced to forfeit most of his wealth to pay damages to their families.

[.my2]
**"双重危险"原则, 并不妨碍当事人在"民事诉讼"（个人之间就"合同"或"人身伤害赔偿"等问题产生的法律纠纷）中获得赔偿，即使被指控实施犯罪行为的人,最终被判无罪。**20 世纪 90 年代的一个著名案例, 涉及前橄榄球明星兼电视名人 O·J· 辛普森 。**辛普森虽然在"刑事法庭"上被判无罪，**免于谋杀其前妻妮可·布朗及其朋友罗恩·戈德曼的指控，*但在随后的"民事诉讼"中，他被认定对两人的死亡负有责任，并因此被迫放弃大部分财产,以赔偿受害者家属。*

Perhaps the most famous provision of the Fifth Amendment is its protection against self-incrimination, or the right to remain silent. This provision is so well known that we have a phrase for it: “taking the Fifth.” People have the right not to give evidence in court or to law enforcement officers that might constitute an admission of guilt or responsibility for a crime. Moreover, in a criminal trial, if someone does not testify in their own defense, the prosecution cannot use that failure to testify as evidence of guilt or imply that an innocent person would testify. This provision became embedded in the public consciousness following the Supreme Court’s 1966 ruling in Miranda v. Arizona, whereby suspects were required to be informed of their most important rights, including the right against self-incrimination, before being interrogated in police custody. However, contrary to some media depictions of the Miranda warning, law enforcement officials do not necessarily have to inform suspects of their rights before they are questioned in situations where they are free to leave.

[.my2]
##**第五修正案中最著名的条款, 或许就是其对公民免于"自证其罪"的保护，也就是"保持沉默"的权利。**##这项条款广为人知，甚至有一个专门的短语来指代它：“行使第五修正案权利”。**人们有权##不在##法庭或执法人员面前提供任何可能构成认罪或承认犯罪责任的证据。**此外，##**在刑事审判中，如果某人不为自己辩护，控方不得将此作为"其有罪"的证据，**##也不得暗示无辜者会出庭作证。这项条款在 1966 年最高法院对 “米兰达诉亚利桑那州案”作出裁决后深入人心。 该裁决规定，在警方拘留期间讯问嫌疑人之前，必须告知其最重要的权利，包括"免于自证其罪"的权利。  然而，与媒体对"米兰达警告"的一些描述相反，*在嫌疑人可以自由离开的情况下，执法人员在讯问前, 不一定必须告知嫌疑人其权利。*

Like the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process clause, the Fifth Amendment prohibits the federal government from depriving people of their “life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” Recall that due process is a guarantee that people will be treated fairly and impartially by government officials when the government seeks to fine or imprison them or take their personal property away from them. The courts have interpreted this provision to mean that government officials must establish consistent, fair procedures to decide when people’s freedoms are limited. In other words, citizens cannot be detained, their freedom limited, or their property taken arbitrarily or on a whim by police or other government officials. As a result, an entire body of procedural safeguards comes into play for the legal prosecution of crimes. However, the Patriot Act, passed into law after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, somewhat altered this notion.

[.my2]
与第十四修正案的"正当程序"条款类似，第五修正案, 禁止联邦政府未经正当法律程序, 剥夺公民的“生命、自由或财产”。"正当程序"保障公民在政府试图对其处以罚款、监禁或没收其个人财产时，能够受到政府官员公平公正的对待。法院对该条款的解释是，政府官员必须建立一致、公平的程序, 来决定何时限制公民的自由。换言之，公民不得被警察或其他政府官员任意或随意拘留、限制自由或没收财产。因此，在对犯罪行为进行法律追究时，一整套程序保障措施得以发挥作用。然而，在9/11恐怖袭击事件后通过的《爱国者法案》, 在一定程度上改变了这一理念。

The final provision of the Fifth Amendment has little to do with crime at all. The takings clause says that “private property [cannot] be taken for public use, without just compensation.” This provision, along with the due process clause’s provisions limiting the taking of property, can be viewed as a protection of individuals’ economic liberty: their right to obtain, use, and trade tangible and intangible property for their own benefit. For example, you have the right to trade your knowledge, skills, and labor for money through work or the use of your property, or trade money or goods for other things of value, such as clothing, housing, education, or food.

[.my2]
第五修正案的最后一条条款, 与犯罪几乎毫无关系。 征用条款规定，“未经公平补偿，不得为公共用途而征用私人财产”。该条款, 连同"正当程序"条款中"限制财产征用"的规定，可以被视为对"个人经济自由"的保护：即个人为自身利益获取、使用和交易"有形和无形财产"的权利。例如，你有权通过工作或利用自己的财产，用自己的知识、技能和劳动换取金钱，也有权用金钱或物品换取其他有价值的东西，比如衣物、住房、教育或食物。

A significant recent controversy over economic liberty has been sparked by cities’ and states’ use of the power of eminent domain to take property for redevelopment. Traditionally, the main use of eminent domain was to obtain property for transportation corridors like railroads, highways, canals and reservoirs, and pipelines, which require fairly straight routes to be efficient. Because any single property owner could effectively block a particular route or extract an unfair price for land if it was the last piece needed to assemble a route, there are reasonable arguments for using eminent domain as a last resort in these circumstances, particularly for projects that convey substantial benefits to the public at large.

[.my2]
近期，城市和州政府动用"征用权", 征收土地用于重建项目，引发了一场关于经济自由的重大争议。传统上，征用权的主要用途是为铁路、公路、运河、水库和管道等交通走廊获取土地，这些设施需要相对笔直的路线才能高效运行。由于任何单一的土地所有者, 都可能有效地阻碍特定路线的建设，或者如果某块土地是构成该路线的最后一块，则可以索取不公平的价格。因此，在某些情况下，特别是对于那些能为广大公众带来实质性利益的项目，将"征用权"作为最后的手段是合理的。

However, increasingly eminent domain has been used to allow economic development, with beneficiaries ranging from politically connected big businesses such as car manufacturers building new factories to highly profitable sports teams seeking ever-more-luxurious stadiums (Figure 4.14). And, while we traditionally think of property owners as relatively well-off people who can fend for themselves in the political system and whose rights don’t necessarily need protecting, these cases frequently pit lower- and middle-class homeowners against multinational corporations or multimillionaires with the ear of city and state officials. In a notorious 2005 case, Kelo v. City of New London, the Supreme Court sided with municipal officials taking homes in a middle-class neighborhood to obtain land for a large pharmaceutical company’s corporate campus. Ultimately, the campus was not built on the seized land and the case led to a public backlash against the use of eminent domain and legal changes in many states, making it harder for cities to take property from one private party and give it to another for economic redevelopment purposes. Eminent domain has once again become a salient issue in the context of the Trump administration's attempt to use the doctrine to seize several parcels of private property for the proposed border wall.

[.my2]
然而，"征用权"越来越多地被用于促进经济发展，受益者包括与政界关系密切的大企业（例如汽车制造商，他们在此建造新工厂）, 以及利润丰厚的体育俱乐部（他们寻求建造更加豪华的体育场馆）（ 图 4.14 ）。虽然我们传统上认为业主是相对富裕的人，他们能够在政治体系中自保，其权利也未必需要保护，但这些案例往往使中低收入房主, 与跨国公司或能够左右市、州官员决策的亿万富翁, 对簿公堂。在 2005 年臭名昭著的 “凯洛诉新伦敦市” 一案中，最高法院支持市政官员征用中产阶级社区的房屋，以便为一家大型制药公司建造企业园区。  最终，该园区并未建在被征用的土地上，此案引发了公众对"征用权"的强烈反对，并促使许多州修改法律，使城市更难将私人财产从一方征用,并转让给另一方用于经济重建。在特朗普政府试图利用"征用权"原则, 征用多块私人土地, 修建拟建"边境墙"的背景下，"征用权"再次成为一个突出问题 。


Some disputes over economic liberty have gone beyond the idea of eminent domain. In the past few years, companies seeking to offer profitable services online such as direct sales by electric car manufacturer Tesla Motors, on-demand ride-sharing services like Lyft and Uber, and short-term property rentals through companies like Airbnb have led to conflict with states and cities trying to regulate these businesses, and with incumbent service providers such as hotels and taxi cabs. In the absence of new public policies to clarify rights, the path forward is often determined through norms established by governments or by court cases.

[.my2]
一些关于经济自由的争议, 已经超越了"征用权"的范畴。过去几年，一些公司试图通过网络提供盈利服务，例如电动汽车制造商特斯拉汽车的直销、Lyft 和 Uber 等"按需拼车"服务，以及 Airbnb 等公司提供的"短期房屋租赁"服务，引发了与"试图监管这些业务的各州和城市"，以及与"酒店、出租车等现有服务提供商"之间的冲突。在缺乏新的公共政策来明确权利的情况下，前进的道路往往由政府确立的规范或法院案件来决定。

Sometimes, however, the legislative process seeks to clarify or improve the interpretation and application of amendments. The Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration Act is aimed at reducing the practice of civil forfeiture, in which governments and law enforcement entities seize property of people suspected of crimes, prior to conviction and sometimes without bringing formal charges. The government can take financial assets, jewelry, vehicles, art, and other items of value. The bipartisan bill, backed by organizations ranging from the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation to the ACLU, would reduce what its Senate sponsors, Rand Paul and Cory Booker, refer to as "policing for profit." Civil forfeiture was a mainstay of the war on drugs and contributed to the mass incarceration of people of color. It can be economically damaging even for those who are never charged or convicted, because in many cases seized property is not returned to its owner. Various court cases have ruled on aspects of the practice, but have not eliminated it decisively, leaving the opportunity for a new law to address it.

[.my2]
然而，有时立法程序会试图阐明或完善修正案的解释与适用。《第五修正案诚信恢复法案》旨在减少"民事没收"行为，即政府和执法机构在对涉嫌犯罪的人定罪之前，有时甚至在未提起正式指控的情况下，就没收其财产。政府可以没收金融资产、珠宝、车辆、艺术品和其他有价值的物品。这项两党联合提出的法案, 得到了从"倾向保守的传统基金会"到"美国公民自由联盟"等各类组织的支持，它将减少其参议院提案人兰德·保罗和科里·布克所说的“以利润为目的的 policing”。民事没收是禁毒战争的主要手段，也是导致有色人种大规模监禁的原因之一。即使对于那些从未被起诉或定罪的人来说，这种行为也可能造成经济损失，因为在许多情况下，被没收的财产不会归还给其所有者。多起法院案件已对这种做法的多个方面作出裁决，但并未彻底废除它，这就为新法律解决这一问题留下了机会。

=== THE SIXTH AMENDMENT

[.my2]
第六修正案


Once someone has been charged with a crime and indicted, the next stage in a criminal case is typically the trial itself, unless a plea bargain is reached. The Sixth Amendment contains the provisions that govern criminal trials. In full, it states:


[.my2]
一旦某人被指控犯罪,并被正式起诉，刑事案件的下一阶段通常是审判，除非达成"认罪协议"。 第六修正案包含了规范"刑事审判"的条款。其全文如下：

“In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence [sic].”

[.my2]
“在所有刑事诉讼中，被告人有权获得迅速和公开的审判，审判应由犯罪发生地的州和地区的公正陪审团进行，该地区应事先由法律确定；有权知悉指控的性质和原因；有权与'对其不利的证人'对质；有权强制传唤'对其有利的证人'出庭作证，并有权获得律师协助为其辩护。”

The first of these guarantees is the right to have a speedy, public trial by an impartial jury. Although there is no absolute limit on the length of time that may pass between an indictment and a trial, the Supreme Court has said that excessively lengthy delays must be justified and balanced against the potential harm to the defendant. In effect, the speedy trial requirement protects people from being detained indefinitely by the government. Yet the courts have ruled that there are exceptions to the public trial requirement; if a public trial would undermine the defendant’s right to a fair trial, it can be held behind closed doors, while prosecutors can request closed proceedings only in certain, narrow circumstances (generally, to protect witnesses from retaliation or to guard classified information). In general, a prosecution must also be made in the “state and district” where the crime was committed; however, people accused of crimes may ask for a change of venue for their trial if they believe pre-trial publicity or other factors make it difficult or impossible for them to receive a fair trial where the crime occurred.

[.my2]
这些保障措施中的第一项, 是获得由公正陪审团, 进行迅速、公开审判的权利。虽然"起诉"和"审判"之间的时间长短没有绝对限制，但最高法院指出，过长的延误必须有正当理由，并且要权衡其对被告可能造成的损害。 实际上，**"迅速审判"的要求, 保护人们免遭政府无限期拘留。**然而，法院裁定"公开审判"的要求, 存在例外情况；**如果公开审判会损害被告获得"公正审判"的权利，则可以进行"闭门审判"，**而检察官只能在某些特定情况下（通常是为了保护证人免遭报复, 或保护机密信息）, 要求进行闭门审判**。一般来说，起诉必须在犯罪发生地所在的“州和地区”进行**；但是，如果被指控犯罪的人认为, 审前宣传或其他因素导致他们在犯罪发生地难以或不可能获得公正审判，他们可以要求变更审判地点。

Most people accused of crimes decline their right to a jury trial. This choice is typically the result of a plea bargain, an agreement between the defendant and the prosecutor in which the defendant pleads guilty to the charge(s) in question, or perhaps to less serious charges, in exchange for more lenient punishment than they might receive if convicted after a full trial. There are a number of reasons why this might happen. The evidence against the accused may be so overwhelming that conviction is a near-certainty, so the accused might decide that avoiding the more serious penalty (perhaps even the death penalty) is better than taking the small chance of being acquitted after a trial. Someone accused of being part of a larger crime or criminal organization might agree to testify against others in exchange for lighter punishment. At the same time, prosecutors might want to ensure a win in a case that might not hold up in court by securing convictions for offenses they know they can prove, while avoiding a lengthy trial on other charges they might lose.

[.my2]
大多数被指控犯罪的人, 会放弃"接受陪审团审判"的权利。这一选择通常是"辩诉交易(plea bargain)"的结果——被告与检察官达成协议，被告对指控（或较轻指控）认罪，以换取比"经过完整审判后被定罪可能面临的"更轻处罚。出现这种情况的原因有多种：针对被告的证据可能过于确凿，定罪几乎不可避免，因此被告可能认为, 避免更严厉的刑罚（甚至可能是死刑）, 比接受审判后获得无罪释放的微小机会, 更有利；被指控"参与更严重犯罪或犯罪组织"的嫌疑人, 可能同意指证他人, 以换取较轻处罚；同时，检察官可能希望通过"确保对可证明的罪行定罪, 来保证案件胜诉"（这些案件在法庭上可能难以成立），同时避免因其他可能败诉的指控, 而进行冗长审判。

The requirement that a jury be impartial is a critical requirement of the Sixth Amendment. Both the prosecution and the defense are permitted to reject potential jurors who they believe are unable to fairly decide the case without prejudice. However, the courts have also said that the composition of the jury as a whole may in itself be prejudicial, so potential jurors may not be rejected simply because of their race or sex, for example.

[.my2]
陪审团必须保持公正，这是第六修正案的一项关键要求。##**控辩双方均有权拒绝他们认为"无法公正地,且无偏见地审理案件"的潜在陪审员。**##然而，**法院也指出，陪审团的整体构成本身, 可能就存在偏见，因此，例如，不得仅仅因为种族或性别等原因, 而拒绝潜在陪审员。 **

The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right of those accused of crimes to present witnesses in their own defense (if necessary, compelling them to testify) and to confront and cross-examine witnesses presented by the prosecution. In general, the only testimony acceptable in a criminal trial must be given in a courtroom and be subject to cross-examination; hearsay, or testimony by one person about what another person has said, is generally inadmissible, although hearsay may be presented as evidence when it is an admission of guilt by the defendant or a “dying declaration” by a person who has passed away. Although both sides in a trial have the opportunity to examine and cross-examine witnesses, the judge may exclude testimony deemed irrelevant or prejudicial.

[.my2]
美国宪法第六修正案, 保障被告人"有权传唤证人, 为自己辩护"（必要时, 可强制证人作证），并有权与"控方证人"当面对质, 并进行交叉询问。一般来说，刑事审判中唯一可接受的证词, 必须在法庭上作出，并接受"交叉询问"；##**传闻证据，即一人转述另一人所说的话，通常不予采纳.**##但如果传闻是被告人认罪, 或死者临终遗言，则可以作为证据采纳。虽然审判中, 控辩双方都有机会"询问"和"交叉询问"证人，但法官可以排除其认为无关或有偏见的证词。

Finally, the Sixth Amendment guarantees the right of those accused of crimes to have the assistance of an attorney in their defense. Historically, many states did not provide attorneys to those accused of most crimes who could not afford one themselves, and even when an attorney was provided, their assistance was often inadequate, at best. This situation changed as a result of the Supreme Court’s decision in Gideon v. Wainwright (1963).54 Clarence Gideon, a poor drifter, was accused of breaking into and stealing money and other items from a pool hall in Panama City, Florida. Denied a lawyer, Gideon was tried and convicted and sentenced to a five-year prison term. While in prison and still without assistance of a lawyer, he drafted a handwritten appeal and sent it to the Supreme Court, which agreed to hear his case (Figure 4.15). The justices unanimously ruled that Gideon, and anyone else accused of a serious crime, was entitled to the assistance of a lawyer, even if they could not afford one, as part of the general due process right to a fair trial.

[.my2]
最后，第六修正案保障了"被控犯罪者"获得"律师辩护"的权利。历史上，许多州并未向"无力承担律师费用的被告人"提供律师，即便提供了律师，其提供的帮助也往往不足。最高法院在吉迪恩诉温赖特案 （1963 年）中的判决, 改变了这一局面。克拉伦斯· 吉迪恩是一名贫困的流浪汉，他被控闯入佛罗里达州巴拿马城的一家台球厅，盗窃钱财和其他物品。由于无法获得律师，吉迪恩被审判并定罪，被判处五年监禁。在狱中，他仍然没有律师的帮助，于是手写了一份上诉状, 并寄给了最高法院，最高法院同意受理此案（ 图 4.15 ）。*法官们一致裁定，吉迪恩以及任何其他被指控犯有严重罪行的人，都有权获得律师的帮助，即使他们负担不起律师费，这是获得公平审判的"一般正当程序权利"的一部分。*


The Supreme Court later extended the Gideon v. Wainwright ruling to apply to any case in which an accused person faced the possibility of “loss of liberty,” even for one day. The courts have also overturned convictions in which people had incompetent or ineffective lawyers through no fault of their own. The Gideon ruling has led to an increased need for professional public defenders, lawyers who are paid by the government to represent those who cannot afford an attorney themselves, although some states instead require practicing lawyers to represent poor defendants on a pro bono basis (essentially, donating their time and energy to the case).

[.my2]
最高法院后来将"Gideon v. Wainwright"判决的适用范围, 扩展到所有被告可能面临"自由被剥夺"（loss of liberty）的案件，哪怕只是可能被监禁一天。法院还推翻了一些"因非自身过错, 而由不称职或无效律师代理的定罪"判决。尽管某些州要求"执业律师"以公益服务（pro bono）形式, 为贫困被告提供辩护（本质上即无偿投入时间精力办案），但"吉迪恩案"判决仍导致对"专业公设辩护人"（public defenders）的需求增加——这类律师由政府支付薪酬，代表无力自行聘请律师的当事人。

==== Insider Perspective -- Criminal Justice: Theory Meets Practice

[.my2]
内部视角 -- 刑事司法：理论与实践

Typically, a person charged with a serious crime will have a brief hearing before a judge to be informed of the charges against the person, to be made aware of the right to counsel, and to enter a plea. Other hearings may be held to decide on the admissibility of evidence seized or otherwise obtained by prosecutors.

[.my2]
通常情况下，被控犯有重罪的人, 会在法官面前进行简短的聆讯，以了解对其提出的指控、被告知 其获得律师协助的权利，并进行答辩。此外，可能还会举行其他聆讯，以决定"检方查获, 或以其他方式获得的证据"的可采性。

If the two sides cannot agree on a plea bargain during this period, the next stage is the selection of a jury. A pool of potential jurors is summoned to the court and screened for impartiality, with the goal of seating twelve (in most states) and one or two alternates. All hear the evidence in the trial and unless an alternate must serve, the original twelve decide whether the evidence overwhelmingly points toward guilt, or innocence beyond a reasonable doubt.

[.my2]
如果双方在此期间无法就"认罪协议"达成一致，则进入下一阶段：遴选陪审团。法院会召集一批潜在陪审员，并对其进行"公正性审查"，**最终（大多数州）确定12名陪审员, 和1至2名候补陪审员。**所有陪审员都将听取"庭审证据"，除非必须由"候补陪审员"履行职责，否则由最初的12名陪审员, 来决定"证据是否足以证明被告有罪"，或者"被告是否在排除合理怀疑的情况下, 无罪"。

In the trial itself, the lawyers for the prosecution and defense make opening arguments, followed by testimony by witnesses for the prosecution (and any cross-examination), and then testimony by witnesses for the defense, including the defendant if the defendant chooses. Additional prosecution witnesses may be called to rebut testimony by the defense. Finally, both sides make closing arguments. The judge then issues instructions to the jury, including an admonition not to discuss the case with anyone outside the jury room. The jury members leave the courtroom to enter the jury room and begin their deliberations (Figure 4.16).

[.my2]
在庭审过程中，控辩双方律师首先进行"开庭陈述"，随后"控方证人"作证（并接受"交叉询问"），之后"辩方证人"作证，被告本人也可选择出庭作证。控方还可以传唤其他证人, 反驳辩方证词。最后，双方进行"结案陈词"。法官随后向陪审团发出指示，其中包括**告诫陪审团成员"不得与陪审室以外的任何人讨论案情"(以免引入公众舆论, 对法官的独立自主断案, 造成舆情压力)。**陪审团成员离开法庭进入陪审室，开始进行评议（ 图 4.16 ）。

图 4.16 美国典型的法庭。陪审团坐在法庭的一侧，位于法官/证人席和控辩双方的桌子之间。

The jurors pick a foreman or forewoman to coordinate their deliberations. They may ask to review evidence or to hear transcripts of testimony. They deliberate in secret and their decision must be unanimous. If they are unable to agree on a verdict after extensive deliberation, a mistrial may be declared, which in effect requires the prosecution to try the case all over again.

[.my2]
**陪审员们**会选出一名陪审长（或女陪审长）来协调他们的审议工作。他们可以要求查阅证据, 或听取证词笔录。他们的审议是秘密进行的，而且**必须全体一致通过。如果经过长时间的审议后，他们仍然无法达成一致意见，则可以宣布审判无效，这实际上意味着控方需要重新审理此案。**

A defendant found not guilty of all charges will be immediately released unless other charges are pending (e.g., the defendant is wanted for a crime in another jurisdiction). If the defendant is found guilty of one or more offenses, the judge will choose an appropriate sentence based on the law and the circumstances. In the federal system, this sentence will typically be based on guidelines that assign point values to various offenses and facts in the case. If the prosecution is pursuing the death penalty, the jury will decide whether the defendant should be subject to capital punishment or life imprisonment.

[.my2]
如果被告被判无罪，除非还有其他指控待决（例如，被告因在其他司法管辖区犯罪而被通缉），否则将被立即释放。**如果"被告"被判犯有一项或多项罪行，**法官将根据法律和具体情况, 选择适当的刑罚。*在联邦司法系统中，该刑罚通常依据"量刑指南"，该指南对案件中的各种罪行和事实, 赋予不同的分值。如果检方寻求判处死刑，则由陪审团决定被告应被判处死刑, 还是终身监禁。*

The reality of court procedure is much less dramatic and exciting than what is typically portrayed in television shows and movies. Nonetheless, most Americans will participate in the legal system at least once in their lives as a witness, juror, or defendant.

[.my2]
真实的法庭程序, 远没有电视节目和电影中描绘的那样戏剧化和激动人心。尽管如此，大多数美国人一生中至少会以证人、陪审员, 或被告的身份, 参与到法律程序中。

Have you or any member of your family served on a jury? If so, was the experience a positive one? Did the trial proceed as expected? If you haven’t served on a jury, is it something you look forward to? Why or why not?

=== THE SEVENTH AMENDMENT

[.my2]
第七修正案


The Seventh Amendment deals with the rights of those engaged in civil disputes—disagreements between individuals or businesses in which people are typically seeking compensation for some harm caused. For example, in an automobile accident, the person responsible is compelled to compensate any others (either directly or through their insurance company). Much of the work of the legal system consists of efforts to resolve civil disputes. The Seventh Amendment, in full, reads:

[.my2]
第七修正案, 涉及"民事纠纷"中各方的权利——**民事纠纷是指个人或企业之间, 因某种损害而产生的争议，通常涉及寻求赔偿。**例如，在交通事故中，肇事者必须赔偿其他各方（可以直接赔偿，也可以通过保险公司赔偿）。法律体系的大部分工作, 都是为了解决民事纠纷。第七修正案全文如下：

“In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.”

[.my2]
“*在普通法诉讼中，如果争议金额超过二十美元，则应保留"陪审团审判"的权利；任何经陪审团审判的事实，除按照普通法规则外，不得在美国任何法院重新审查。*”

Because of this provision, all trials in civil cases must take place before a jury unless both sides waive their right to a jury trial. However, this right is not always incorporated. In many states, civil disputes—particularly those involving small sums of money, which may be heard by a dedicated small claims court—need not be tried in front of a jury and may instead be decided by a judge working alone.

[.my2]
##**根据这项规定，所有"民事案件"的审理, 都必须由陪审团进行，除非双方都放弃"陪审团审判"的权利。**##然而，这项权利并非总是得到保障。在许多州，民事纠纷——特别是涉及小额金额的纠纷（此类纠纷可能由专门的"小额索赔法庭"审理）——无需陪审团审理，而可以由法官单独裁决。

The Seventh Amendment limits the ability of judges to reconsider questions of fact, rather than of law, that were originally decided by a jury. For example, if a jury decides a person was responsible for an action and the case is appealed, the appeals judge cannot decide someone else was responsible. This preserves the traditional common-law distinction that judges are responsible for deciding questions of law while jurors are responsible for determining the facts of a particular case.

[.my2]
#*第七修正案限制了"法官重新审理事实问题（而非法律问题）"的权力，这些"事实问题", 最初是由陪审团裁决的。例如，如果陪审团裁定"某人应对某项行为负责"，而该案被上诉，上诉法官不能裁定"其他人应承担责任"。这维护了传统的普通法区分，即法官负责裁决"法律问题"，而陪审员负责确定"特定案件的事实"。*#

=== THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT

[.my2]
第八修正案



The Eighth Amendment says, in full:

[.my2]
第八修正案全文如下：

“Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.”

[.my2]
“不得要求过高的保释金，不得处以过高的罚款，不得施加残酷和不寻常的惩罚。”

Bail is a payment of money that allows a person accused of a crime to be freed pending trial. If you “make bail” in a case and do not show up for your trial, you will forfeit the money you paid. Since many people cannot afford to pay bail directly, they may instead get a bail bond, which allows them to pay a fraction of the money (typically 10 percent) to a person who sells bonds and who pays the full bail amount. (In most states, the bond seller makes money because the defendant does not get back the money for the bond, and most people show up for their trials.) However, people believed likely to flee or who represent a risk to the community while free may be denied bail and held in jail until their trial takes place.

[.my2]
##**"保释"是指支付一笔钱，使被控犯罪的人在审判前, 获得自由。如果您缴纳了保释金, 却未出庭受审，您将失去已支付的保释金。**##由于许多人无力直接支付保释金 ，他们可以选择购买"保释债券" ，即支付一部分保释金（通常为 10%）给债券销售商，由后者支付剩余的保释金。（在大多数州，债券销售商之所以能获利，是因为被告无法收回保释金，而且大多数人都会出庭受审。）然而，*如果某人被认为可能潜逃, 或在获释后对社区构成威胁，则可能##被拒绝保释，并被关押至审判开始。##*

It is rare for bail to be successfully challenged for being excessive. The Supreme Court has defined an excessive fine as one “so grossly excessive as to amount to deprivation of property without due process of law” or “grossly disproportional to the gravity of a defendant’s offense.” Historically, the courts have rarely struck down fines as excessive, though California and other states have recently passed legislation seeking to reform the more discriminatory aspects of the bail system.

[.my2]
保释金因过高而被成功质疑的情况实属罕见。最高法院将"过高的罚款"定义为“过高到足以构成未经正当法律程序而剥夺财产”或“与被告罪行的严重程度,严重不成比例”。 历史上，法院很少以"罚款过高"为由, 驳回罚款，尽管加利福尼亚州和其他一些州, 最近通过了旨在"改革保释制度中歧视性条款"的立法。

The most controversial provision of the Eighth Amendment is the ban on “cruel and unusual punishments.” Various torturous forms of execution common in the past—drawing and quartering, burning people alive, and the electric chair—are prohibited by this provision. Recent controversies over lethal injections and firing squads demonstrate that the topic of whether and how to execute is still very much alive. The Dutch producer of one of the chemicals in the most common lethal injection cocktail recently refused to export it to the United States when it was shown to protract the dying process for some inmates, maintaining consciousness, prolonging suffering, and paralyzing response. In a 2021 case, one death row prisoner lost an appeal to request death by firing squad in lieu of lethal injection. While the Supreme Court has never established a definitive test for what constitutes a cruel and unusual punishment, it has generally allowed most penalties short of death for adults, even when the punishment appears disproportionate or excessive to outside observers.

[.my2]
第八修正案中最具争议的条款, 是禁止“残酷和不寻常的惩罚”。过去常见的各种酷刑处决方式——例如肢解、活活烧死和电椅——均被该条款禁止。  近期关于注射死刑和枪决的争议表明，是否以及如何执行死刑的话题, 仍然非常活跃。最近，一种用于最常用"注射死刑药物"的荷兰生产商, 拒绝向美国出口该药物，因为有研究表明，该药物会延长部分囚犯的死亡过程，使其保持意识、延长痛苦, 并导致反应迟钝。在 2021 年的一起案件中，一名死刑犯上诉失败，他要求以"枪决"代替注射死刑。虽然最高法院从未确立构成"残酷和不寻常惩罚"的明确标准，但它通常允许对成年人执行除死刑以外的大多数刑罚，即使在外界看来, 这些刑罚不成比例或过度。

In recent years the Supreme Court has issued a series of rulings substantially narrowing the application of the death penalty. As a result, defendants who have intellectual disabilities may not be executed. Defendants who were under eighteen when they committed an offense that would otherwise be subject to the death penalty may not be executed. The court has generally rejected the application of the death penalty to crimes that did not result in the death of another human being, most notably in the case of rape. And, while permitting the death penalty to be applied to murder in some cases, the Supreme Court has generally struck down laws that require the application of the death penalty in certain circumstances. Still, the United States is among ten countries with the most executions worldwide, with the Trump Justice Department pushing through a flurry of thirteen executions in the last four months of his administration, breaking with the 130-year-old precedent of pausing executions amid a presidential transition (Figure 4.17).

[.my2]
近年来，最高法院发布了一系列裁决，大幅缩小了死刑的适用范围。因此，*智力障碍的被告人, 可能不会被执行死刑。  未满十八岁时犯下本应判处死刑罪行的被告人, 可能不会被执行死刑。  法院通常拒绝将死刑 适用于"未造成他人死亡的犯罪"，最显著的例子是强奸罪。*  虽然最高法院允许在某些情况下对"谋杀罪"适用死刑，但它通常会否决那些"要求在特定情况下适用死刑"的法律。尽管如此，美国仍然是全球执行死刑最多的十个国家之一。特朗普政府的司法部, 在其执政的最后四个月里, 强行执行了十三起死刑，打破了 130 年来"在总统权力交接期间, 暂停执行死刑"的惯例。

At the same time, however, it appears that the public mood may have shifted somewhat against the death penalty, perhaps due in part to an overall decline in violent crime. The reexamination of past cases through DNA evidence has revealed dozens in which people were wrongfully executed.61 For example, Claude Jones was executed for murder based on 1990-era DNA testing of a single hair that was determined at that time to be his but that with better DNA testing technology was later found to be that of the victim.62 Perhaps as a result of this and other cases, seven additional states have abolished capital punishment since 2007. As of 2015, nineteen states and the District of Columbia no longer apply the death penalty in new cases, and several other states do not carry out executions despite sentencing people to death. It remains to be seen whether this gradual trend toward the elimination of the death penalty by the states will continue, or whether the Supreme Court will eventually decide to follow former Justice Harry Blackmun’s decision to “no longer… tinker with the machinery of death” and abolish it completely.

[.my2]
然而，与此同时，公众对死刑的态度似乎有所转变，"反对死刑"的情绪有所下降，这或许部分归因于暴力犯罪率的整体下降。通过 DNA 证据对过往案件的重新审查，揭示了数十起冤案 。 例如，克劳德· 琼斯因谋杀罪被处决，依据是 1990 年代的一项 DNA 检测，当时的检测结果认定一根头发属于他，但后来随着 DNA 检测技术的进步，发现这根头发属于受害者。或许正是由于这起案件以及其他类似案例，自 2007 年以来，又有七个州废除了死刑。截至 2015 年，已有 19 个州和哥伦比亚特区, 不再对新案件适用死刑，另有几个州虽然判处死刑，但并未执行。  各州逐步废除死刑的趋势是否会继续下去，或者最高法院最终是否会遵循前大法官哈里· 布莱克门“不再……修补死刑机制”并彻底废除死刑的决定，还有待观察。
