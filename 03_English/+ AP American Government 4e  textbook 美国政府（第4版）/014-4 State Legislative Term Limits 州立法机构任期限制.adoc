== 释义




Term limits restrict the length of time a member can serve in the state legislature by capping either lifetime service or the number of consecutive terms. The term limits movement gained momentum in the 1990s, spreading across a wide array of state legislative institutions. Today, fifteen states have imposed term limits on their state house and state senate members. On the other hand, six states, one as recently as 2004, have repealed the term limits imposed on them by the electorate, through either judicial action in the state Supreme Courts or through legislative action in the state legislature.71
任期限制通过限制终身任期或连续任期数来约束州议员的任职时间。 任期限制运动在 20 世纪 90 年代兴起，并迅速扩展到各州立法机构。如今，已有 15 个州对其州众议院和州参议院议员实施了任期限制。另一方面，有 6 个州，其中一个州甚至在 2004 年，通过州最高法院的司法诉讼或州立法机构的立法行动，废除了选民施加的任期限制 。71

THE BASICS OF TERM LIMITS
任期限制的基本知识
Under consecutive term limits, a member can serve for only a specified period of time in either the state house or the state senate, most commonly eight years. To try to regain a seat in the legislature once the limit has been met, the member will have to wait to run for office again. If the member succeeds, the clock will reset and the legislator may once again serve up to the limit set by the state. In states with a lifetime ban, such as Oklahoma, members can serve only one time for the number of years allotted, and they are not permitted to run for office again (Figure 14.17).72
在连任限制制度下，议员在州众议院或州参议院的任期通常为八年。一旦达到任期上限，议员若想再次当选，则必须等待重新竞选。如果当选成功，任期将重新计算，议员可以再次任职，直至达到州规定的任期上限。在实行终身制的州，例如俄克拉荷马州，议员只能任职一次，任期即为规定的年限，且不得再次竞选连任（ 图 14.17 ）。 72

A graph titled “Term Limits by State”. The x-axis is labeled “State” and the y-axis is labeled “Years”. The graph has a legend with four categories marked “House”, “Senate,” “Total,” and “Lifetime Ban”. From left to right on the x-axis: “MI” has a ban of 6 years lifetime in the house, and 8 years total lifetime in the senate; “NE” has a ban of 8 years total; “AZ” has a ban of 8 years in the house, and 8 years in the senate; “CO” has a ban of 8 years in the house, and 8 years in the senate; “FL” has a ban of 8 years in the house, and 8 years in the senate; “ME” has a ban of 8 years in the house, and 8 years in the senate; “MT” has a ban of 8 years in the house, and 8 years in the senate; “OH” has a ban of 8 years in the house, and 8 years in the senate; “SD” has a ban of 8 years in the house, and 8 years in the senate; “MO” has a ban of 8 years in the house, and 8 years total lifetime in the senate; “CA” has a ban of 12 years lifetime; “OK” has a ban of 12 years lifetime; “LA” has a ban of 12 years in the house, and 12 years in the senate; “NV” has a ban of 12 years in the house, and 12 years total lifetime in the senate; “AR” has a ban of 16 years total.”

图 14.17 目前有 15 个州实行某种形式的任期限制。该图表显示了哪些州实行连续任期限制或终身禁止，以及在每种情况下议员可以任职的时长。
The first term limits were enacted in 1990 in California, Colorado, and Oklahoma. In 1992, eight more states followed suit in one large wave. The last state to enact term limits on legislative members was Nebraska in 2000.73 However, term limits did not stay in effect in all these states; many state supreme courts repealed them and declared them unconstitutional for a variety of reasons (Figure 14.18). For instance, in Massachusetts and Washington, term limits were deemed unconstitutional because they affected candidate qualifications to compete for a given office. The courts ruled that changes to those qualifications could be made only by amending the state constitution, not by voters changing the state law.74
1990 年，加利福尼亚州、科罗拉多州和俄克拉荷马州率先颁布了任期限制法。1992 年，又有八个州效仿，掀起了一股浪潮。最后一个对立法委员实行任期限制的州是内布拉斯加州，时间是 2000 年。 73 然而，任期限制法并非在所有这些州都一直有效；许多州最高法院以各种理由废除了这些限制，并宣布其违宪（ 图 14.18 ）。例如，在马萨诸塞州和华盛顿州，任期限制被认定违宪，因为它们影响了候选人竞选特定职位的资格。法院裁定，对这些资格的修改只能通过修改州宪法来实现，而不能通过选民修改州法律来实现。 74

A timeline chart titled “Term Limit Repeals”. A horizontal line stretches across the chart and is marked with seven points. The first point is labeled “Enacted (1992), WY, OR, WA”. An arrow points from “WA” to the fourth point on the timeline, labeled “Repealed by State Supreme Court (1998)”. An arrow points from “OR” to the fifth point on the timeline, labeled “Repealed by State Supreme Court (2002)”. An arrow points from “WA” to the seventh point on the timeline, labeled “Repealed by State Supreme Court (2004)”. The second point is labeled “Enacted (1994), MA, ID, UT”. An arrow points from “MA” to the third point on the timeline, labeled ““Repealed by State Supreme Court (1997)”. An arrow points from “ID” to the fifth point on the timeline, labeled “Repealed by Legislature (2002)”. An arrow points from “UT” to the sixth point on the timeline, labeled “Repealed by Legislature (2003)”.

ADVANTAGES OF TERM LIMITS
任期限制的优势
In many cases, the movement to institute term limits was initiated by voters and passed through citizen initiatives, which allow citizens to place a proposed law or constitutional amendment on the ballot for a popular vote.75 Proponents of term limits felt new blood was needed in state legislatures to bring fresh ideas and perspectives to lawmaking. In addition, they hoped term limits would compel turnover among members by shortening the time anyone could serve and by reducing the tendency for elected officials to make legislative service their career. In conjunction with this thinking, some supporters hoped term limits would increase the motivation to make good public policy. If members were less focused on reelection and knew they could not serve more than a certain number of years, perhaps they would get right down to the business of making laws and produce innovative policy within a narrow window of time.76
在许多情况下，实行任期限制的运动是由选民发起并通过公民倡议实现的 。 公民倡议允许公民将拟议的法律或宪法修正案提交全民投票表决。75 任期限制的支持者认为，州立法机构需要新鲜血液，为立法带来新的理念和视角。此外，他们希望任期限制能够缩短议员的任期，从而减少当选官员将立法工作作为职业的倾向，进而促使议员更迭。基于这种想法，一些支持者希望任期限制能够提高制定良好公共政策的积极性。如果议员们不再那么关注连任，并且知道自己的任期不能超过一定年限，他们或许会更加专注于立法工作，并在有限的时间内制定出创新性的政策 。76

For other proponents, the hope was that term limits would increase diversity within the chamber by encouraging more women, members of racial and ethnic minority groups, members of the minority party, and people with unconventional occupations to run for office because seats would be open more frequently. In addition, supporters speculated that increased turnover might prompt higher rates of electoral competition and voter interest. Finally, they believed the loss of long-term legislators due to term limits would allow new members and younger legislators to assume leadership positions within the chamber and committees, creating another way to bring fresh approaches to the lawmaking process. 77
对于其他支持者而言，他们希望任期限制能够增加议会内部的多样性，鼓励更多女性、少数族裔成员、少数党成员以及从事非传统职业的人士参选，因为席位空缺会更加频繁。此外，支持者推测，更频繁的人员更替可能会促使选举竞争更加激烈，选民的参与度也会更高。最后，他们认为，由于任期限制导致长期议员的离任，将使新议员和年轻议员有机会在议会和委员会中担任领导职务，从而为立法过程带来新的思路 。77

Working to Expand Term Limits
努力扩大任期限制
One pro–term limits advocacy group, U.S. Term Limits, is dedicated to the expansion of term limits across the United States. Its members work to prevent states from repealing limits that are already in place. They also support efforts by citizens to institute term limits in states where they are not currently in place, and in Congress, where the Supreme Court declared them unconstitutional.78
一个名为“美国任期限制”（ US Term Limits ）的支持任期限制的倡导组织致力于在美国各地推广任期限制。该组织的成员努力阻止各州废除现有的任期限制。他们还支持公民在目前尚未实施任期限制的州以及最高法院已宣布违宪的国会中推行任期限制的努力 。78

DISADVANTAGES OF TERM LIMITS
任期限制的缺点
Although proponents have many reasons for supporting term limits, opponents also have compelling reasons for not supporting their implementation in the state legislature. In addition, research by political scientists has uncovered a number of negative consequences since term limits took effect.

[.my2]
尽管支持者有很多理由支持任期限制，但反对者也有充分的理由不支持在州立法机构实施任期限制。此外，政治学家的研究也揭示了任期限制生效以来的一些负面影响。

Although proponents argued that term limits would increase legislative diversity, research comparing the rate of female and minority representation in term-limited and non-term-limited states does not bear out this expectation. There is no statistically significant difference in diversity between the two groups of states.79 Although term limits may have produced more open seats, additional barriers to holding office can still exist and affect the willingness of women and minorities to run for office. In addition, women and minorities are subject to the same term limits as men, and given their low numbers among candidates for office, on balance a legislature can lose more women or minorities than it gains.

[.my2]
尽管支持者认为任期限制能够提升立法机构的多样性，但对实行任期限制和不实行任期限制的州中女性和少数族裔代表比例的比较研究并未证实这一预期。两组州在多样性方面并无统计学上的显著差异。 79 虽然任期限制可能增加了空缺席位，但其他任职障碍依然存在，并可能影响女性和少数族裔参选的意愿。此外，女性和少数族裔与男性一样受到任期限制，而鉴于她们在候选人中人数较少，总体而言，立法机构流失的女性或少数族裔人数可能多于新增人数。

Term limits also affect the power structure between the legislative and executive branches and the key sources from whom legislators draw information about bills before the chamber. Research demonstrates that, post-term limits, legislators became more likely to consult with lobbyists to gain information about legislation under consideration than had been the case before term limits.80 This is likely the result of legislators having less policy expertise and political experience as a function of having fewer years in office, being younger when they first enter legislative service, reducing institutional memory and expertise within the chamber as a whole due to member turnover, or all the above. Interest groups may thus enjoy greater ability to set the agenda and push for policy that favors their organization. This same research also found that under term limits state legislators feel they have lost power relative to the governor and to various bureaucratic agency officials.81 This presumed loss of power could damage the state legislature’s ability to adequately check the actions of the executive branch and to perform legislative functions, such as oversight.

[.my2]
任期限制也影响立法和行政部门之间的权力结构，以及立法者获取议案信息的主要来源。研究表明，任期限制实施后，立法者比任期限制实施前更有可能咨询游说者以获取有关正在审议的立法的信息。 80 这可能是由于立法者任期较短、初入立法机构时年龄较小、议员更迭导致议会整体机构记忆和专业知识减少，或以上所有因素共同作用，从而导致立法者政策专业知识和政治经验不足。因此，利益集团可能更有能力设定议程并推动有利于其组织的政策。同一项研究还发现，在任期限制下，州立法者感觉自己相对于州长和各官僚机构官员的权力有所下降。 81 这种权力下降的预期可能会损害州立法机构充分制衡行政部门行为和履行立法职能（例如监督）的能力。

Finally, term limits could affect voter enthusiasm and turnout if voters are disappointed they cannot retain legislators they like or have developed a positive relationship with. Once term limits take effect, all legislators are at the voters’ mercy, regardless of the skill or talent they may bring to the office.

[.my2]
最后，如果选民对无法留住自己喜欢或已建立良好关系的立法者感到失望，任期限制可能会影响选民的热情和投票率。一旦任期限制生效，所有立法者都将任由选民摆布，无论他们具备何种技能或才能。
