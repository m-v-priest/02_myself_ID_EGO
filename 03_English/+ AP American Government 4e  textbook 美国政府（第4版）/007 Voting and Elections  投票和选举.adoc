== 释义


Lawyer Andy Beshear became the attorney general of Kentucky in 2016 after defeating the incumbent by fewer than 2,000 votes. A Democrat in a Republican-dominated state, he engaged in widely publicized lawsuits against the governor, Matt Bevin. Beshear challenged the governor on issues related to overstepping gubernatorial authority, such as restructuring teacher pensions, replacing university boards, and similar actions, without the involvement of the state legislature. While he was only successful in some cases, Beshear elevated his reputation and gained support against Bevin, whom polls indicated was the least popular governor in the nation. Beshear also filed landmark lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies for their roles in the Kentucky's (and the nation's) opioid crisis; several of those companies settled the suits for massive sums.

律师安迪·贝希尔 (Andy Beshear) 于 2016 年当选肯塔基州总检察长，他以不到 2000 票的微弱优势击败了时任总检察长。作为一名民主党人，在共和党占主导地位的肯塔基州，他发起了一系列广为人知的诉讼，矛头直指州长马特·贝文 (Matt Bevin)。贝希尔就州长越权问题向其发起挑战，例如在未经州议会批准的情况下重组教师养老金、更换大学董事会等。尽管他只在部分案件中胜诉，但贝希尔的声望显著提升，并赢得了更多民众的支持，而民调显示，贝文是当时全美支持率最低的州长。贝希尔还就制药公司在肯塔基州乃至全美阿片类药物危机中所扮演的角色提起了具有里程碑意义的诉讼；其中几家公司最终支付了巨额赔偿金以达成和解。

Beshear ran against Bevin in the 2019 election. While he had gained popularity and recognition, winning an election in a Republican state was a challenge. Beshear navigated sensitive issues such as gun rights and abortion by taking positions that appealed to Democrats in Kentucky's urban areas and were generally were acceptable to moderate Republicans. For example, he indicated he would not pursue an assualt weapons ban. Beshear defeated Bevin in what was the closest governor's race in Kentucky history. In 2023, he ran for and won reelection by a wider margin: approximately 5 percent.1
贝希尔在 2019 年的选举中挑战贝文。尽管他已积累了一定的知名度和人气，但在一个共和党占主导地位的州赢得选举并非易事。贝希尔巧妙地处理了枪支权利和堕胎等敏感问题，采取的立场既能吸引肯塔基州城市地区的民主党选民，也能被温和派共和党人所接受。例如，他曾表示不会推行攻击性武器禁令。贝希尔最终击败贝文，赢得了肯塔基州历史上最接近的州长选举。2023 年，他再次竞选连任，并以更大的优势获胜，得票率约为 5% 。

Figure 7.1 In 2019, Andy Beshear was narrowly elected governor of Kentucky after serving as attorney general in the state. After winning reelection by a wider margin in 2023, he and Lieutenant Governor Jacqueline Coleman remain Kentucky's only Democratic statewide elected officials, and the state has consistently voted Republican in subsequent Presidential and Congressional elections.
