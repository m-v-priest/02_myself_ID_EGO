== 释义





The tension between local and national politics described in the previous section is essentially a struggle between interpretations of representation. Representation is a complex concept. It can mean paying careful attention to the concerns of constituents, understanding that representatives must act as they see fit based on what they feel best for the constituency, or relying on the particular ethnic, racial, or gender diversity of those in office. In this section, we will explore three different models of representation and the concept of descriptive representation. We will look at the way members of Congress navigate the challenging terrain of representation as they serve, and all the many predictable and unpredictable consequences of the decisions they make.

前一节所述的本地政治与国家政治之间的张力，本质上是对“代表权”概念的不同解读。代表权是一个复杂的概念。它可以指认真倾听选民的诉求，理解代表必须根据自身对选民的利益判断行事，也可以指依赖于在职人员的种族、民族或性别多样性。本节将探讨三种不同的代表权模式以及描述性代表权的概念。我们将考察国会议员在履行职责的过程中如何应对代表权的种种挑战，以及他们所做决定的诸多可预见和不可预见的后果。

TYPES OF REPRESENTATION: LOOKING OUT FOR CONSTITUENTS
代表的类型：为选民着想
By definition and title, senators and House members are representatives. This means they are intended to be drawn from local populations around the country so they can speak for and make decisions for those local populations, their constituents, while serving in their respective legislative houses. That is, representation refers to an elected leader’s looking out for constituents while carrying out the duties of the office.26
根据定义和称谓，参议员和众议员都是代表。这意味着他们应当从全国各地的当地民众中选出，以便在各自的立法机构任职期间，能够代表这些当地民众（即他们的选民）发声并做出决策。也就是说， 代表权指的是民选领导人在履行职务的同时，也要为选民着想 。26

Theoretically, the process of constituents voting regularly and reaching out to their representatives helps these congresspersons better represent them. It is considered a given by some in representative democracies that representatives will seldom ignore the wishes of constituents, especially on salient issues that directly affect the district or state. In reality, the job of representing in Congress is often quite complicated, and elected leaders do not always know where their constituents stand. Nor do constituents always agree on everything. Navigating their sometimes contradictory demands and balancing them with the demands of the party, powerful interest groups, ideological concerns, the legislative body, their own personal beliefs, and the country as a whole can be a complicated and frustrating process for representatives.

[.my2]
理论上，选民定期投票并与代表沟通有助于国会议员更好地代表他们。在代议制民主国家，一些人认为，代表们很少会忽视选民的意愿，尤其是在直接影响选区或州的重大问题上。然而，实际上，在国会代表选民的工作往往相当复杂，当选的领导人并不总是了解选民的立场。选民也并非在所有事情上都意见一致。对于代表们来说，如何在有时相互矛盾的诉求、党派诉求、强大的利益集团诉求、意识形态考量、立法机构的利益、自身的信仰以及整个国家的利益之间取得平衡，可能是一个复杂而令人沮丧的过程。

Traditionally, representatives have seen their role as that of a delegate, a trustee, or someone attempting to balance the two. Representatives who see themselves as delegates believe they are empowered merely to enact the wishes of constituents. Delegates must employ some means to identify the views of their constituents and then vote accordingly. They are not permitted the liberty of employing their own reason and judgment while acting as representatives in Congress. This is the delegate model of representation.

[.my2]
传统上，代表们将自己的角色视为委托人、受托人或试图平衡二者的角色。那些将自己视为委托人的代表认为，他们的权力仅仅在于执行选民的意愿。委托人必须通过某种方式了解选民的意见，然后据此投票。作为国会代表，他们无权运用自己的理性和判断。这就是委托人模式的代表制 。

In contrast, a representative who understands their role to be that of a trustee believes they are entrusted by the constituents with the power to use good judgment to make decisions on the constituents’ behalf. In the words of the eighteenth-century British philosopher Edmund Burke, who championed the trustee model of representation, “Parliament is not a congress of ambassadors from different and hostile interests . . . [it is rather] a deliberative assembly of one nation, with one interest, that of the whole.”27 In the modern setting, trustee representatives will look to party consensus, party leadership, powerful interests, the member’s own personal views, and national trends to better identify the voting choices they should make.

[.my2]
相反，一位将自身角色理解为受托人的代表则认为，选民赋予他们权力，让他们运用良好的判断力代表选民做出决策。正如十八世纪英国哲学家埃德蒙·伯克所言，他倡导受托人代表制模式 ，“议会并非来自不同甚至敌对利益集团的代表大会……[它]是一个国家，一个拥有共同利益（即全体人民的利益）的审议机构。” 27 在现代社会，受托人代表会参考党内共识、党内领导层、强大的利益集团、成员自身的个人观点以及国家趋势，以更好地确定他们应该做出的投票选择。

Understandably, few if any representatives adhere strictly to one model or the other. Instead, most find themselves attempting to balance the important principles embedded in each. Political scientists call this the politico model of representation. In it, members of Congress act as either trustee or delegate based on rational political calculations about who is best served, the constituency or the nation.

[.my2]
可以理解，几乎没有代表会严格遵循任何一种模式。相反，大多数代表都在努力平衡每种模式所蕴含的重要原则。政治学家称之为 “政治代表模式” 。在这种模式下，国会议员根据理性的政治考量，决定是作为受托人还是代表，来决定谁的利益最大化，是选民的利益还是国家的利益。

For example, every representative, regardless of party or conservative versus liberal leanings, must remain firm in support of some ideologies and resistant to others. On the political right, an issue that demands support might be gun rights; on the left, it might be a woman’s right to an abortion. For votes related to such issues, representatives will likely pursue a delegate approach. For other issues, especially complex questions the public at large has little patience for, such as subtle economic reforms, representatives will tend to follow a trustee approach. This is not to say their decisions on these issues run contrary to public opinion. Rather, it merely means they are not acutely aware of or cannot adequately measure the extent to which their constituents support or reject the proposals at hand. It could also mean that the issue is not salient to their constituents. Congress works on hundreds of different issues each year, and constituents are likely not aware of the particulars of most of them.

[.my2]
例如，每一位代表，无论党派或政治倾向如何，都必须坚定地支持某些意识形态，同时抵制其他意识形态。在政治右翼，需要支持的议题可能是拥枪权；在左翼，则可能是女性堕胎权。对于与此类议题相关的投票，代表们很可能会采取代表制的方式。而对于其他议题，尤其是公众普遍缺乏耐心的复杂问题，例如微妙的经济改革，代表们则倾向于采取受托人式的做法。这并非意味着他们在这些问题上的决定与民意相悖。而仅仅意味着他们并不十分清楚或无法充分衡量选民对相关提案的支持或反对程度。这也可能意味着该议题对他们的选民而言并不重要。国会每年处理数百个不同的议题，而选民很可能并不了解其中大多数议题的具体细节。

DESCRIPTIVE REPRESENTATION IN CONGRESS
国会中的描述性代表制
In some cases, representation can seem to have very little to do with the substantive issues representatives in Congress tend to debate. Instead, proper representation for some is rooted in the racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, gender, and sexual identity of the representatives themselves. This form of representation is called descriptive representation.

[.my2]
在某些情况下，代表性似乎与国会代表们通常辩论的实质性问题关系不大。相反，对某些人来说，恰当的代表性根植于代表自身的种族、民族、社会经济地位、性别和性取向。这种代表性形式被称为描述性代表 。

At one time, there was relatively little concern about descriptive representation in Congress. A major reason is that until well into the twentieth century, White men of European background constituted an overwhelming majority of the voting population. African Americans were routinely deprived of the opportunity to participate in democracy, and Hispanics and other minority groups were fairly insignificant in number and excluded by the states. While women in many western states could vote sooner, all women were not able to exercise their right to vote nationwide until passage of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, and they began to make up more than 5 percent of either chamber only in the 1990s.

[.my2]
过去，人们对国会的种族代表性关注甚少。一个主要原因是，直到 20 世纪中叶，欧洲裔白人男性仍然占据选民的绝大多数。非裔美国人长期以来被剥夺了参与民主的机会，而西班牙裔和其他少数族裔人口数量微不足道，且被各州排除在外。虽然许多西部州的女性较早获得了投票权，但直到 1920 年第十九修正案通过后，所有女性才得以在全国范围内行使投票权，而直到 20 世纪 90 年代，女性在国会两院的席位比例才开始超过 5%。

Many advances in women’s rights have been the result of women’s greater engagement in politics and representation in the halls of government, especially since the founding of the National Organization for Women in 1966 and the National Women’s Political Caucus (NWPC) in 1971. The NWPC was formed by Bella Abzug (Figure 11.11), Gloria Steinem, Shirley Chisholm, and other leading feminists to encourage women’s participation in political parties, elect women to office, and raise money for their campaigns. For example, Patsy Mink (D-HI) (Figure 11.11), the first Asian American woman elected to Congress, was the coauthor of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, Title IX of which prohibits sex discrimination in education. Mink had been interested in fighting discrimination in education since her youth, when she opposed racial segregation in campus housing while a student at the University of Nebraska. She went to law school after being denied admission to medical school because of her gender. Like Mink, many other women sought and won political office, many with the help of the NWPC. Today, EMILY’s List, a PAC founded in 1985 to help elect pro-choice Democratic women to office, plays a major role in fundraising for female candidates. In the 2018 midterm elections, thirty-four women endorsed by EMILY's List won election to the U.S. House.28 In 2020, the Republicans took a page from the Democrats' playbook when they made the recruitment and support of quality female candidates a priority and increased the number of Republican women in the House from thirteen to twenty-eight, including ten seats formerly held by Democrats.29
女性权利的诸多进步都源于女性更多地参与政治以及在政府机构中获得代表权，尤其是在 1966 年全国妇女组织（NOW）和 1971 年全国妇女政治联盟（NWPC）成立之后。NWPC 由贝拉· 阿布祖格 （ 图 11.11 ）、格洛丽亚·斯泰纳姆、雪莉·奇泽姆和其他杰出的女权主义者创立，旨在鼓励女性参与政党活动、选举女性担任公职，并为她们的竞选活动筹集资金。例如，帕齐· 明克 （夏威夷州民主党籍众议员）（ 图 11.11 ）是首位当选国会议员的亚裔美国女性，她也是 1972 年 《教育修正案》的共同起草人之一，该法案的第九条禁止教育领域的性别歧视。明克自幼便致力于消除教育领域的歧视，在内布拉斯加大学就读期间，她就曾反对校园宿舍的种族隔离。她因性别原因被医学院拒之门外，之后转而攻读法学院。与明克一样，许多其他女性也积极竞选并赢得了政治职位，其中许多人得到了全国妇女政治行动委员会（NWPC）的帮助。如今，成立于 1985 年的政治行动委员会“艾米丽名单”（EMILY's List）在为女性候选人筹款方面发挥着重要作用。该委员会旨在帮助支持堕胎权的民主党女性当选公职。在 2018 年中期选举中，34 位获得“艾米丽名单”支持的女性当选为美国众议院议员。2020 年，共和党效仿民主党的做法，将招募和支持优秀的女性候选人作为优先事项，并将共和党在众议院的女性议员人数从 13 人增加到 28 人，其中包括 10 个此前由民主党人占据的席位。

In the wake of the Civil Rights Movement, African American representatives also began to enter Congress in increasing numbers. In 1971, to better represent their interests, these representatives founded the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), an organization that grew out of a Democratic select committee formed in 1969. Founding members of the CBC include Ralph Metcalfe (D-IL), a former sprinter from Chicago who had medaled at both the Los Angeles (1932) and Berlin (1936) Olympic Games, and Shirley Chisholm, a founder of the NWPC and the first African American woman to be elected to the House of Representatives (Figure 11.12).

[.my2]
在民权运动之后，越来越多的非裔美国人代表开始进入国会。1971 年，为了更好地代表他们的利益，这些代表成立了国会黑人议员团 （CBC），该组织由 1969 年成立的一个民主党特别委员会发展而来。CBC 的创始成员包括来自芝加哥的前短跑运动员拉尔夫·梅特卡夫（伊利诺伊州民主党籍众议员），他曾在洛杉矶（1932 年）和柏林（1936 年）奥运会上获得奖牌；以及全国妇女议员团（NWPC）的创始人之一雪莉·奇泽姆，她是第一位当选众议院议员的非裔美国女性（ 图 11.12 ）。

In recent decades, Congress has become much more descriptively representative of the United States. The 117th Congress, which began in January 2021 had a historically large percentage of racial and ethnic minorities. African Americans made up the largest percentage, with sixty-two members (including two delegates and two people who would soon resign to serve in the executive branch), while Latinos accounted for fifty-four members (including two delegates and the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico), up from thirty just a decade before.30 Yet, demographically speaking, Congress as a whole is still a long way from where the country is and is composed of largely White wealthy men. For example, although more than half the U.S. population is female, only 25 percent of Congress is. Congress is also overwhelmingly Christian (Figure 11.13).

[.my2]
近几十年来，国会的构成越来越能代表美国的人口结构。2021 年 1 月开始的第 117 届国会中，少数族裔的比例达到了历史最高水平。非裔美国人占比最高，共有 62 名议员（包括两名众议员和两名即将辞职进入行政部门任职的议员），而拉丁裔议员则有 54 名（包括两名众议员和波多黎各常驻专员），比十年前的 30 名有所增加。然而，从人口统计学角度来看，国会整体的构成与美国人口的构成仍有很大差距，仍然主要由白人富裕男性组成。例如，尽管美国人口中女性超过半数，但国会中女性议员仅占 25%。此外，国会也绝大多数是基督徒（ 图 11.13 ）。

REPRESENTING CONSTITUENTS
代表选民
Ethnic, racial, gender, or ideological identity aside, it is a representative’s actions in Congress that ultimately reflect their understanding of representation. Congress members’ most important function as lawmakers is writing, supporting, and passing bills. And as representatives of their constituents, they are charged with addressing those constituents’ interests. Historically, this job has included what some have affectionately called “bringing home the bacon” but what many (usually those outside the district in question) call pork-barrel politics. As a term and a practice, pork-barrel politics—federal spending on projects designed to benefit a particular district or set of constituents—has been around since the nineteenth century, when barrels of salt pork were both a sign of wealth and a system of reward. While pork-barrel politics are often deplored during election campaigns, and earmarks—funds appropriated for specific projects—are no longer permitted in Congress (see feature box below), legislative control of local appropriations nevertheless still exists. In more formal language, allocation, or the influencing of the national budget in ways that help the district or state, can mean securing funds for a specific district’s project like an airport, or getting tax breaks for certain types of agriculture or manufacturing.

[.my2]
撇开种族、民族、性别或意识形态身份不谈，最终体现代表对代表权理解的，是他们在国会的行动。国会议员作为立法者的最重要职责是撰写、支持和通过法案。作为选民的代表，他们肩负着维护选民利益的重任。历史上，这项工作包括一些人戏称为“为选民谋取利益”的活动，但许多人（通常是选区外的人）称之为 “猪肉桶政治” 。“猪肉桶政治”一词及其实践——即联邦政府将资金用于旨在惠及特定选区或选民群体的项目——早在 19 世纪就已出现，当时成桶的咸猪肉既是财富的象征，也是一种奖励制度。尽管“猪肉桶政治”在竞选活动中经常受到谴责，而且国会也不再允许专项拨款（用于特定项目的资金）（见下文专题框），但立法机构对地方拨款的控制仍然存在。更正式地说， 拨款 ，或者说以某种方式影响国家预算以帮助地区或州，可以指为特定地区的项目（如机场）争取资金，或者为某些类型的农业或制造业争取税收减免。

Language and Metaphor  语言与隐喻
The language and metaphors of war and violence are common in politics. Candidates routinely “smell blood in the water,” “battle for delegates,” go “head-to-head,” and “make heads roll.” But references to actual violence aren’t the only metaphorical devices commonly used in politics. Another is mentions of food. Powerful speakers frequently “throw red meat to the crowds”; careful politicians prefer to stick to “meat-and-potato issues”; and representatives are frequently encouraged by their constituents to “bring home the bacon.” And the way members of Congress typically “bring home the bacon” is often described with another agricultural metaphor, the “earmark.”
战争和暴力相关的语言和隐喻在政治中屡见不鲜。候选人经常“嗅到血腥味”、“争夺代表”、“针锋相对”、“人人自危”。但提及实际暴力并非政治中唯一常用的隐喻手法。另一个常用的隐喻是食物。雄辩的演说家经常“抛出诱人的内容”；谨慎的政治家更倾向于关注“实际问题”；而选民也经常鼓励议员们“为民谋利”。国会议员们通常“为民谋利”的方式，往往用另一个农业隐喻——“专项拨款”来形容。

In ranching, an earmark is a small cut on the ear of a cow or other animal to denote ownership. Similarly, in Congress, an earmark is a mark in a bill that directs some of the bill’s funds to be spent on specific projects or for specific tax exemptions. Since the 1980s, the earmark has become a common vehicle for sending money to various projects around the country. Many a road, hospital, and airport can trace its origins back to a few skillfully drafted earmarks.

[.my2]
在畜牧业中，“ 专项标记” 是指在牛或其他动物的耳朵上做一个小切口，用来标明所有权。同样，在国会中，“专项标记”是指法案中指定部分资金用于特定项目或特定税收减免的条款。自 20 世纪 80 年代以来，“专项标记”已成为向全国各地各种项目拨款的常用方式。许多道路、医院和机场的建设都可追溯到当初精心拟定的几项专项标记。

Relatively few people outside Congress had ever heard of the term before the 2008 presidential election, when Republican nominee Senator John McCain touted his career-long refusal to use the earmark as a testament to his commitment to reforming spending habits in Washington.31 McCain’s criticism of the earmark as a form of corruption cast a shadow over a previously common legislative practice. As the country sank into recession and Congress tried to use spending bills to stimulate the economy, the public grew more acutely aware of its earmarking habits. Congresspersons then were eager to distance themselves from the practice. In fact, the use of earmarks to encourage Republicans to help pass health care reform actually made the bill less popular with the public.

[.my2]
在 2008 年总统大选之前，除了国会议员之外，很少有人听说过“专项拨款”这个词。当时，共和党候选人、参议员约翰·麦凯恩大力宣扬自己职业生涯中一直拒绝使用专项拨款，以此证明他致力于改革华盛顿的支出习惯。 31 麦凯恩对专项拨款作为一种腐败形式的批评，给这种此前常见的立法做法蒙上了一层阴影。随着美国陷入经济衰退，国会试图通过支出法案来刺激经济，公众对国会使用专项拨款的做法也越来越敏感。国会议员们急于与这种做法划清界限。事实上，利用专项拨款来鼓励共和党人支持医改法案的做法，反而降低了该法案在公众中的支持率。

In 2011, after Republicans took over the House, they outlawed earmarks. But with deadlocks and stalemates becoming more common, some quiet voices have begun asking for a return to the practice. They argue that Congress works because representatives can satisfy their responsibilities to their constituents by making deals. The earmarks are those deals. By taking them away, Congress has hampered its own ability to “bring home the bacon.”
2011年，共和党掌控众议院后，取缔了专项拨款。但随着僵局和僵持局面日益频繁，一些人开始呼吁恢复这种做法。他们认为，国会之所以能够运作，是因为议员们可以通过达成协议来履行对选民的职责。专项拨款正是这些协议的体现。取消专项拨款，实际上削弱了国会自身“为选民谋取利益”的能力。

Are earmarks a vital part of legislating or a corrupt practice that was rightly jettisoned? Pick a cause or industry, and investigate whether any earmarks ever favored it, or research the way earmarks have hurt or helped your state or district, and decide for yourself.

[.my2]
专项拨款是立法的重要组成部分，还是应该被废除的腐败做法？选择一个事业或行业，调查一下是否有任何专项拨款曾经有利于它，或者研究一下专项拨款对你的州或地区产生了哪些影响，然后自己做出判断。

Follow-up activity: Find out where your congressional representative stands on the ban on earmarks and write to support or dissuade them.

[.my2]
后续行动：了解你的国会代表对禁止专项拨款的立场，并写信表示支持或劝阻。

Such budgetary allocations aren’t always looked upon favorably by constituents. Consider, for example, the passage of the ACA in 2010. The desire for comprehensive universal health care had been a driving position of the Democrats since at least the 1960s. During the 2008 campaign, that desire was so great among both Democrats and Republicans that both parties put forth plans. When the Democrats took control of Congress and the presidency in 2009, they quickly began putting together their plan. Soon, however, the politics grew complex, and the proposed plan became very contentious for the Republican Party.

[.my2]
此类预算拨款并非总能获得选民的认可。例如，2010 年《平价医疗法案》（ACA）的通过就是一个例证。自 20 世纪 60 年代以来，全民医保一直是民主党的核心诉求。在 2008 年的总统竞选期间，民主党和共和党都强烈希望实现全民医保，并提出了各自的方案。2009 年，民主党掌控国会和总统职位后，迅速着手制定自己的方案。然而，不久之后，政治局势变得复杂起来，共和党提出的方案也引发了激烈的争议。

Nevertheless, the desire to make good on a decades-old political promise compelled Democrats to do everything in their power to pass something. They offered sympathetic members of the Republican Party valuable budgetary concessions; they attempted to include allocations they hoped the opposition might feel compelled to support; and they drafted the bill in a purposely complex manner to avoid future challenges. These efforts, however, had the opposite effect. The Republican Party’s constituency interpreted the allocations as bribery and the bill as inherently flawed, and felt it should be scrapped entirely. The more Democrats dug in, the more frustrated the Republicans became (Figure 11.14).

[.my2]
然而，为了兑现几十年前的政治承诺，民主党人竭尽全力试图通过一项法案。他们向共和党中支持他们的成员提供了宝贵的预算让步；他们试图加入一些拨款条款，希望以此迫使反对派支持；他们还故意将法案写得复杂难懂，以避免日后出现争议。然而，这些努力却适得其反。共和党的支持者将这些拨款条款解读为贿赂，并认为法案本身存在缺陷，应该彻底废除。民主党人越是坚持己见，共和党人就越是感到沮丧（ 图 11.14 ）。

The Republican opposition, which took control of the House during the 2010 midterm elections, promised constituents they would repeal the law. Their attempts were complicated, however, by the fact that Democrats still held the Senate and the presidency. Yet, the desire to represent the interests of their constituents compelled Republicans to use another tool at their disposal, the symbolic vote. During the 112th and 113th Congresses, Republicans voted more than sixty times to either repeal or severely limit the reach of the law. They understood these efforts had little to no chance of ever making it to the president’s desk. And if they did, he would certainly have vetoed them. But it was important for these representatives to demonstrate to their constituents that they understood their wishes and were willing to act on them.

[.my2]
在2010年中期选举中夺取众议院控制权的共和党反对派向选民承诺，他们将废除这项法律。然而，由于民主党仍然掌控着参议院和总统职位，他们的努力变得复杂起来。尽管如此，为了代表选民的利益，共和党人还是动用了另一种手段——象征性投票。在第112届和113届国会期间，共和党人投票超过60次，试图废除或大幅限制这项法律的适用范围。他们明白，这些努力几乎不可能最终提交到总统的办公桌上。即便提交了，总统也肯定会否决。但对这些议员来说，重要的是向选民表明，他们理解选民的意愿，并且愿意为此采取行动。

Historically, representatives have been able to balance their role as members of a national legislative body with their role as representatives of a smaller community. The Obamacare fight, however, gave a boost to the growing concern that the power structure in Washington divides representatives from the needs of their constituency.32 This has exerted pressure on representatives to the extent that some now pursue a more straightforward delegate approach to representation. Indeed, following the 2010 election, a handful of Republicans began living in their offices in Washington, convinced that by not establishing a residence in Washington, they would appear closer to their constituents at home.33
历史上，代表们通常能够平衡其作为国家立法机构成员和较小社区代表的双重角色。然而，奥巴马医改之争加剧了人们日益增长的担忧，即华盛顿的权力结构使代表们与其选民的需求脱节。 32 这给代表们带来了压力，以至于一些人现在采取了更为直接的委托代理方式。事实上，在 2010 年大选之后，一些共和党人开始住在华盛顿的办公室里，他们认为，如果不在华盛顿设立住所，他们看起来会更贴近家乡的选民。 33

COLLECTIVE REPRESENTATION AND CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL
集体代表制和国会批准
The concept of collective representation describes the relationship between Congress and the United States as a whole. That is, it considers whether the institution itself represents the American people, not just whether a particular member of Congress represents their district. Predictably, it is far more difficult for Congress to maintain a level of collective representation than it is for individual members of Congress to represent their own constituents. Not only is Congress a mixture of different ideologies, interests, and party affiliations, but the collective constituency of the United States has an even-greater level of diversity. Nor is it a solution to attempt to match the diversity of opinions and interests in the United States with those in Congress. Indeed, such an attempt would likely make it more difficult for Congress to maintain collective representation. Its rules and procedures require Congress to use flexibility, bargaining, and concessions. Yet, it is this flexibility and these concessions, which many now interpret as corruption, that tend to engender the high public disapproval ratings experienced by Congress.

集体代表制的概念描述了国会与整个美国之间的关系。也就是说，它关注的是国会本身是否代表美国人民，而不仅仅是某个国会议员是否代表其选区。可以预见的是，国会维持集体代表制远比国会议员个人代表其选民要困难得多。国会不仅融合了不同的意识形态、利益和党派，而且美国选民的构成更加多元化。试图使美国民众的意见和利益多样性与国会成员的意见和利益多样性相匹配，也并非解决之道。事实上，这种尝试很可能使国会更难维持集体代表制。国会的规则和程序要求国会运用灵活性、协商和让步。然而，正是这种灵活性和让步——如今许多人将其解读为腐败——导致了国会普遍低下的公众支持率。

After many years of deadlocks and bickering on Capitol Hill, the national perception of Congress has tended to run under 20 percent approval in recent years, with large majorities disapproving. Through mid-2021, the Congress, narrowly under Democratic control, was receiving higher approval ratings, above 30 percent. However, congressional approval still lags public approval of the presidency and Supreme Court by a considerable margin. In the two decades following the Watergate scandal in the early 1970s, the national approval rating of Congress hovered between 30 and 40 percent, then trended upward in the 1990s, before trending downward in the twenty-first century.34
多年来，国会山一直陷入僵局和争吵，近年来，公众对国会的支持率普遍低于 20%，绝大多数人表示反对。2021 年年中，在民主党的微弱控制下，国会的支持率有所回升，超过 30%。然而，国会的支持率仍然远低于公众对总统和最高法院的支持率。在 20 世纪 70 年代初水门事件后的二十年里，国会的全国支持率徘徊在 30%到 40%之间，然后在 20 世纪 90 年代呈上升趋势，之后在 21 世纪开始下降。 34

Yet, incumbent reelections have remained largely unaffected. The reason has to do with the remarkable ability of many in the United States to separate their distaste for Congress from their appreciation for their own representative. Paradoxically, this tendency to hate the group but love one’s own representative actually perpetuates the problem of poor congressional approval ratings. The reason is that it blunts voters’ natural desire to replace those in power who are earning such low approval ratings.

然而，现任议员的连任却基本未受影响。原因在于，许多美国人有一种非凡的能力，能够将他们对国会的反感与对本选区议员的喜爱区分开来。矛盾的是，这种“恨国会但爱本选区议员”的倾向，实际上加剧了国会支持率低下的问题。原因在于，它削弱了选民更换那些支持率极低的当权者的自然愿望。

As decades of polling indicate, few events push congressional approval ratings above 50 percent. Indeed, when the ratings are graphed, the two noticeable peaks are at 57 percent in 1998 and 84 percent in 2001 (Figure 11.15). In 1998, according to Gallup polling, the rise in approval accompanied a similar rise in other mood measures, including President Bill Clinton’s approval ratings and general satisfaction with the state of the country and the economy. In 2001, approval spiked after the September 11 terrorist attacks and the Bush administration launched the "War on Terror," sending troops first to Afghanistan and later to Iraq. War has the power to bring majorities of voters to view their Congress and president in an overwhelmingly positive way.35
数十年的民意调查显示，很少有事件能将国会的支持率推高至 50%以上。事实上，从支持率图表来看，两个明显的峰值分别出现在 1998 年的 57%和 2001 年的 84%（ 图 11.15 ）。根据盖洛普民意调查，1998 年，支持率的上升伴随着其他民意指标的类似上升，包括克林顿总统的支持率以及民众对国家和经济状况的总体满意度。2001 年，在 9·11 恐怖袭击事件发生后，随着布什政府发动“反恐战争”，先是向阿富汗派遣军队，后又向伊拉克派遣军队，国会的支持率飙升。战争有能力使大多数选民对国会和总统产生压倒性的积极看法。 35

Chart shows congressional job approval ratings from 1974 to 2015. Starting around 30% in 1974, it rises slightly to 32% in 1975 before dipping to 25% in 1976. After the dip, it spikes again to35% in 1977, before falling again to 20% in 1979. It rises to 38% in 1981, then falls again in 1982 to 30 %. There is a slow increase to 41% in 1986, where it levels out until 1988, when it begins to drop until it reaches 30% in 1990. It rebounds slightly to 31% in 1991, but falls drastically to 20% in 1992. A sharp increase in 1993 to 25% leads to a steady increase of approval ratings until 200 when it reaches 50%. A drastic spike in 2001 shoots approval ratings up to 82%, and a sharp decline lands approval ratings back at 50% by 2003. It levels off for a year, before falling again to 28% in 2006. A small spike in 2007puts it at 35%, before it falls down to 20% in 2009. There is another small increase to 24% in 2010, then another decrease to 10% in 2013. The chart varies between 10 and 20% from 2015 through 2018, with a peak to about 26% in 2019 followed by a drop to about 15% in 2020. The chart ends with an approval rating of 29% in 2021. At the bottom of the chart, a source is cited: “Gallup. “Congress and the Public.”May 18, 2021.”
Figure 11.15 Congress’s job approval rating reached a high of 84 percent in October 2001 following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It declined steadily after that, reaching a low of 9 percent in November 2013, just after the federal government shutdown of the previous month. However, in early 2021, under narrow Democratic control, congressional approval levels rose above 30 percent for the first time since 2009.

图 11.15 显示， 在 2001 年 10 月 9/11 恐怖袭击事件发生后，国会的支持率一度高达 84%。此后，支持率持续下降，并在 2013 年 11 月跌至 9% 的低点，而这恰好发生在前一个月联邦政府停摆之后。然而，在 2021 年初，在民主党以微弱优势控制国会的情况下，国会的支持率自 2009 年以来首次回升至 30% 以上。
Nevertheless, all things being equal, citizens tend to rate Congress more highly when things get done and more poorly when things do not get done. For example, during the first half of President Obama’s first term, Congress’s approval rating reached a relative high of about 40 percent. Both houses were dominated by members of the president’s own party, and many people were eager for Congress to take action to end the deep recession and begin to repair the economy. Millions were suffering economically, out of work, or losing their jobs, and the idea that Congress was busy passing large stimulus packages, working on finance reform, and grilling unpopular bank CEOs and financial titans appealed to many. Approval began to fade as the Republican Party slowed the wheels of Congress during the tumultuous debates over Obamacare and reached a low of 9 percent following the federal government shutdown in October 2013.

然而，在其他条件相同的情况下，民众往往对国会的评价更高，尤其是在国会有所作为的时候；反之，则评价更低。例如，在奥巴马总统第一任期的前半段，国会的支持率一度高达约 40%。当时参众两院均由总统所属政党的成员占据主导地位，许多人渴望国会采取行动，结束严重的经济衰退，并开始修复经济。数百万民众正遭受经济困境，失业或面临失业，而国会忙于通过大规模经济刺激方案、推进金融改革以及质询不受欢迎的银行首席执行官和金融巨头，这一景象吸引了许多人的目光。随着共和党在围绕奥巴马医改法案的激烈辩论中拖慢国会的步伐，国会的支持率开始下滑，并在 2013 年 10 月联邦政府停摆后跌至 9%的低点。

One of the events that began the approval rating’s downward trend was Congress’s divisive debate over national deficits. A deficit is what results when Congress spends more than it has available. It then conducts additional deficit spending by increasing the national debt. Many modern economists contend that during periods of economic decline, the nation should run deficits, because additional government spending has a stimulative effect that can help restart a sluggish economy. Despite this benefit, voters rarely appreciate deficits. They see Congress as spending wastefully during a time when they themselves are cutting costs to get by.

导致支持率下滑的事件之一是国会就国家赤字问题展开的激烈辩论。赤字是指国会支出超过其可用资金的情况。国会随后通过增加国债来追加赤字支出。许多现代经济学家认为，在经济衰退时期，国家应该实行赤字，因为额外的政府支出具有刺激作用，可以帮助重启疲软的经济。尽管有此益处，选民却很少赞同赤字。他们认为，在他们自己都在削减开支以维持生计的时候，国会却在浪费钱。

The disconnect between the common public perception of running a deficit and its legitimate policy goals is frequently exploited for political advantage. For example, while running for the presidency in 2008, Barack Obama slammed the deficit spending of the George W. Bush presidency, saying it was “unpatriotic.” This sentiment echoed complaints Democrats had been issuing for years as a weapon against President Bush’s policies. Following the election of President Obama and the Democratic takeover of the Senate, the concern over deficit spending shifted parties, with Republicans championing a spendthrift policy as a way of resisting Democratic policies.

公众对财政赤字的普遍认知与其合法政策目标之间的脱节，常常被别有用心的人利用来谋取政治利益。例如，2008 年竞选总统时，巴拉克·奥巴马猛烈抨击乔治·W·布什总统的赤字支出政策，称其“不爱国”。这种言论与民主党多年来一直用来攻击布什总统政策的抱怨如出一辙。奥巴马当选总统以及民主党掌控参议院后，对赤字支出的关注点发生了转移，共和党人开始鼓吹大手大脚的财政政策，以此来抵制民主党的政策。
