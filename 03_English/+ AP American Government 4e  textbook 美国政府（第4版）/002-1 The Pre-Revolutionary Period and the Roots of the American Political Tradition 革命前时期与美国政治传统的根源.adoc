== 释义


American political ideas regarding liberty and self-government did not suddenly emerge full-blown at the moment the colonists declared their independence from Britain. The varied strands of what became the American republic had many roots, reaching far back in time and across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe. Indeed, it was not new ideas but old ones that led the colonists to revolt and form a new nation.

美国关于自由和自治的政治理念, 并非在殖民地居民宣布脱离英国独立的那一刻突然完全形成。最终形成美利坚共和国的各种思想脉络源远流长，可以追溯到遥远的过去，甚至跨越大西洋到达欧洲。事实上，促使殖民地居民反抗并建立新国家的, 并非全新的思想，而是古老的理念。

=== POLITICAL THOUGHT IN THE AMERICAN COLONIES

[.my2]
美洲殖民地的政治思想


The beliefs and attitudes that led to the call for independence had long been an important part of colonial life. Of all the political thinkers who influenced American beliefs about government, the most important is surely John Locke (Figure 2.2). The most significant contributions of Locke, a seventeenth-century English philosopher, were his ideas regarding the relationship between government and natural rights, which were believed to be God-given rights to life, liberty, and property.

图 2.2 约翰·洛克是启蒙运动时期最具影响力的思想家之一。他的著作, 构成了许多现代政治思想的基础。


Locke was not the first Englishman to suggest that people had rights. The British government had recognized its duty to protect the lives, liberties, and property of English citizens long before the settling of its North American colonies. In 1215, King John signed Magna Carta—a promise to his subjects that he and future monarchs would refrain from certain actions that harmed, or had the potential to harm, the people of England. Prominent in Magna Carta’s many provisions are protections for life, liberty, and property. For example, one of the document’s most famous clauses promises, “No freemen shall be taken, imprisoned . . . or in any way destroyed . . . except by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land.” Although it took a long time for modern ideas regarding due process to form, this clause lays the foundation for the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. While Magna Carta was intended to grant protections only to the English barons who were in revolt against King John in 1215, by the time of the American Revolution, English subjects, both in England and in North America, had come to regard the document as a cornerstone of liberty for men of all stations—a right that had been recognized by King John I in 1215, but the people had actually possessed long before then.

[.my2]
洛克并非第一个提出"人民拥有权利"的英国人。早在北美殖民地建立之前，英国政府就已认识到保护英国公民的生命、自由和财产的义务。1215 年，约翰国王签署了 《大宪章 》，向其臣民承诺，他本人及未来的君主, 将避免采取任何可能损害或危害英国人民的行为。**《大宪章》的诸多条款中，对生命、自由和财产的保护, 尤为突出。**例如，**该文件最著名的条款之一承诺：“任何自由人，除经其同侪合法审判, 或依国法外，不得被逮捕、监禁……或以任何方式处死……”**尽管现代"正当程序理念"的形成历经漫长岁月，但这一条款为美国宪法第五修正案和第六修正案奠定了基础。虽然《大宪章》最初的目的,是保护 1215 年反抗约翰国王的英国贵族，但到了美国革命时期，无论是在英国还是在北美，英国臣民都已将这份文件, 视为所有阶层人士自由的基石——这项权利虽然在 1215 年被约翰一世国王承认，但人民实际上在此之前很久就已经拥有了。

The rights protected by Magna Carta had been granted by the king, and, in theory, a future king or queen could take them away. The natural rights Locke described, however, had been granted by God and thus could never be abolished by human beings, even royal ones, or by the institutions they created.

[.my2]
#*《大宪章》所保护的权利, 是由国王授予的，理论上，未来的国王或女王可以剥夺这些权利。然而，洛克所描述的"自然权利"是由上帝赋予的，因此永远不能被人类，即使是王室成员，或他们所建立的制度所废除。*#

So committed were the British to the protection of these natural rights that when the royal Stuart dynasty began to intrude upon them in the seventeenth century, Parliament removed King James II, already disliked because he was Roman Catholic, in the Glorious Revolution and invited his Protestant daughter and her husband to rule the nation. Before offering the throne to William and Mary, however, Parliament passed the English Bill of Rights in 1689. A bill of rights is a list of the liberties and protections possessed by a nation’s citizens. The English Bill of Rights, heavily influenced by Locke’s ideas, enumerated the rights of English citizens and explicitly guaranteed rights to life, liberty, and property. This document would profoundly influence the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.

[.my2]
##**英国人如此坚定地捍卫这些自然权利，以至于当斯图亚特王朝在十七世纪开始侵犯这些权利时，议会发动"光荣革命"，**##废黜了因信奉罗马天主教而早已不受欢迎的詹姆斯二世国王，并邀请他的新教女儿和女婿统治国家。然而，*在将王位授予威廉和玛丽之前，#议会于 1689 年通过了《 英国权利法案》。# 权利法案列举了一个国家公民享有的自由和保护。《英国权利法案》深受洛克思想的影响，列举了英国公民的权利，并明确保障了生命权、自由权和财产权。#这份文件对"美国宪法"和"权利法案"产生了深远的影响。#*

American colonists also shared Locke’s concept of property rights. According to Locke, anyone who invested labor in the commons—the land, forests, water, animals, and other parts of nature that were free for the taking—might take as much of these as needed, by cutting trees, for example, or building a fence around a field. The only restriction was that no one could take so much that others were deprived of their right to take from the commons as well. In the colonists’ eyes, all free White males should have the right to acquire property, and once it had been acquired, government had the duty to protect it. (The rights of women remained greatly limited for many more years.)

[.my2]
美国殖民者也认同洛克的"财产权"观念。根据洛克的观点，任何人只要在公共资源 ——土地、森林、水源、牲畜, 以及其他可供自由获取的自然资源——上投入劳动，就可以根据需要, 获取所需，例如砍伐树木, 或在田地周围修建围栏。唯一的限制是，任何人不得过度获取，以致剥夺他人从公共资源中获取的权利。在殖民者看来，所有自由的白人男性都应享有"获取财产"的权利，一旦财产获得，政府就有义务保护它。（女性的权利, 在之后的许多年里, 仍然受到诸多限制。）

Perhaps the most important of Locke’s ideas that influenced the British settlers of North America were those regarding the origins and purpose of government. Most Europeans of the time believed the institution of monarchy had been created by God, and kings and queens had been divinely appointed to rule. Locke, however, theorized that human beings, not God, had created government. People sacrificed a small portion of their freedom and consented to be ruled in exchange for the government’s protection of their lives, liberty, and property. Locke called this implicit agreement between a people and their government the social contract. Should government deprive people of their rights by abusing the power given to it, the contract was broken and the people were no longer bound by its terms. The people could thus withdraw their consent to obey and form another government for their protection.

[.my2]
#*洛克的思想中，对北美英国殖民者影响最大的, 或许是关于"政府的起源和目的"的论述。当时大多数欧洲人认为, "君主制"是由上帝创立的，国王和王后是神授的统治者。然而，洛克认为, 政府并非由上帝创立，而是由人类创立。人们牺牲了一部分自由，同意接受统治，以换取政府对其生命、自由和财产的保护。洛克将人民与其政府之间这种隐性协议, 称为"社会契约" 。如果政府滥用权力, 剥夺人民的权利，契约即被打破，人民不再受其约束。因此，人民可以撤回对政府的服从，并建立另一个政府来保护自己。*#

The belief that government should not deprive people of their liberties and should be restricted in its power over citizens’ lives was an important factor in the controversial decision by the American colonies to declare independence from England in 1776. For Locke, withdrawing consent to be ruled by an established government and forming a new one meant replacing one monarch with another. For those colonists intent on rebelling, however, it meant establishing a new nation and creating a new government, one that would be greatly limited in the power it could exercise over the people.

[.my2]
**认为政府不应剥夺人民的自由，其对公民生活的权力应受到限制，这一信念是1776年美国殖民地宣布脱离英国独立, 这一颇具争议的决定中的一个重要因素。**在洛克看来，放弃对既有政府的统治, 并建立新政府, 意味着用一位君主取代另一位君主。然而，对于那些决心反抗的殖民者而言，这意味着建立一个新国家 和一个新的政府，一个其对人民行使的权力将受到极大限制的政府。

The desire to limit the power of government is closely related to the belief that people should govern themselves. This core tenet of American political thought was rooted in a variety of traditions. First, the British government did allow for a degree of self-government. Laws were made by Parliament, and property-owning males were allowed to vote for representatives to Parliament. Thus, Americans were accustomed to the idea of representative government from the beginning. For instance, Virginia established its House of Burgesses in 1619. Upon their arrival in North America a year later, the English Separatists who settled the Plymouth Colony, commonly known as the Pilgrims, promptly authored the Mayflower Compact, an agreement to govern themselves according to the laws created by the male voters of the colony.1 By the eighteenth century, all the colonies had established legislatures to which men were elected to make the laws for their fellow colonists. When American colonists felt that this longstanding tradition of representative self-government was threatened by the actions of Parliament and the King, the American Revolution began.

[.my2]
**"限制政府权力"的愿望, 与"人民应该自治"的信念, 密切相关。这一美国政治思想的核心原则, 植根于多种传统。首先，#英国政府确实允许一定程度的自治。法律由议会制定，拥有财产的男性可以投票选举议会代表。因此，美国人从一开始就习惯了"代议制政府"的理念。#**例如，弗吉尼亚州于 1619 年建立了其议会。一年后，##**定居普利茅斯殖民地的英国分离主义者（通常被称为清教徒）抵达北美后，立即签署了《五月花号公约》 ，该公约承诺根据殖民地男性选民制定的法律, 进行自治。**到了 18 世纪，**所有殖民地都建立了立法机构，由男性选举产生，为其他殖民地居民制定法律。当美国殖民者感到议会和国王的行为, 威胁到这种由来已久的"代议制自治传统"时，美国革命爆发了。##**

=== THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION


[.my2]
美国革命


The American Revolution began when a small and vocal group of colonists became convinced the king and Parliament were abusing them and depriving them of their rights. By 1776, they had been living under the rule of the British government for more than a century, and England had long treated the thirteen colonies with a degree of benign neglect. Each colony had established its own legislature. Taxes imposed by England were low, and property ownership was more widespread than in England. People readily proclaimed their loyalty to the king. For the most part, American colonists were proud to be British citizens and had no desire to form an independent nation.

[.my2]
**美国革命的起因是，一小群积极发声的殖民地居民, 确信国王和议会正在**虐待他们，**剥夺他们的权利。**到1776年，他们已经在英国政府的统治下生活了一个多世纪，英国长期以来对这十三个殖民地采取了一种宽容的放任态度。每个殖民地都建立了自己的立法机构。英国征收的税款很低，"财产所有权"比英国本土更为普遍。人们也乐于公开宣称效忠国王。大多数美国殖民地居民, 都以身为英国公民而自豪，并无意建立一个独立的国家。

All this began to change in 1763 when the Seven Years War between Great Britain and France came to an end, and Great Britain gained control of most of the French territory in North America. The colonists had fought on behalf of Britain, and many colonists expected that after the war they would be allowed to settle on land west of the Appalachian Mountains that had been taken from France. However, their hopes were not realized. Hoping to prevent conflict with Indian tribes in the Ohio Valley, Parliament passed the Proclamation of 1763, which forbade the colonists to purchase land or settle west of the Appalachian Mountains.

[.my2]
这一切在 1763 年开始发生变化，当时英国和法国之间的七年战争结束，英国控制了北美大部分法国领土。殖民者曾为英国而战，许多人期望战后能够获准在阿巴拉契亚山脉以西、从法国手中夺取的土地上定居。然而，他们的希望落空了。为了避免与俄亥俄河谷的印第安部落发生冲突，英国议会通过了 1763 年公告 ，禁止殖民者在阿巴拉契亚山脉以西购买土地或定居。

To pay its debts from the war and maintain the troops it left behind to protect the colonies, the British government had to take new measures to raise revenue. Among the acts passed by Parliament were laws requiring American colonists to pay British merchants with gold and silver instead of paper currency and a mandate that suspected smugglers be tried in vice-admiralty courts, without jury trials. What angered the colonists most of all, however, was the imposition of direct taxes: taxes imposed on individuals instead of on transactions.

[.my2]
*为了偿还战争债务, 并维持留守殖民地的军队，英国政府不得不采取新的"增收"措施。议会通过的法案包括：要求美国殖民地居民用金银而非纸币, 支付英国商人的款项；以及规定走私嫌疑人必须在"副海军法庭"受审，不得进行"陪审团审判"。然而，最令殖民地居民愤怒的莫过于征收直接税：即对"个人"而非"交易"征收的税款。*

Because the colonists had not consented to direct taxation, their primary objection was that it reduced their status as free men. The right of the people or their representatives to consent to taxation was enshrined in both Magna Carta and the English Bill of Rights. Taxes were imposed by the House of Commons, one of the two houses of the British Parliament. The North American colonists, however, were not allowed to elect representatives to that body. In their eyes, taxation by representatives they had not voted for was a denial of their rights. Members of the House of Commons and people living in England had difficulty understanding this argument. All British subjects had to obey the laws passed by Parliament, including the requirement to pay taxes. Those who were not allowed to vote, such as women and Black people, were considered to have virtual representation in the British legislature; representatives elected by those who could vote made laws on behalf of those who could not. Many colonists, however, maintained that anything except direct representation was a violation of their rights as English subjects.

[.my2]
**由于殖民者并未同意"直接征税"，他们的主要反对理由, 是征税削弱了他们作为自由人的地位。**人民或其代表同意, 征税的权利在《大宪章》和《权利法案》中均有明确规定。税收由英国议会两院之一的"下议院"征收。然而，**北美殖民者无权选举"下议院代表"。#在他们看来，由未经他们投票选出的代表来征税，是对他们权利的剥夺。(就如同, 美国18岁的青年, 要求有投票权, 因为他们正在被非自己选出的议员, 要求青年们去参军打越战.)#**下议院议员和居住在英国的人们难以理解这种论点。所有英国臣民都必须遵守议会通过的法律，包括纳税义务。那些没有投票权的人，例如妇女和黑人，被认为在英国立法机构中拥有虚拟代表权；由"有投票权的人"选举产生的代表, 代表那些没有投票权的人, 来制定法律。然而，*许多殖民者坚持认为，除"直接代表制"之外的任何方式, 都侵犯了他们作为英国臣民的权利。*

The first such tax to draw the ire of colonists was the Stamp Act, passed in 1765, which required that almost all paper goods, such as diplomas, land deeds, contracts, and newspapers, have revenue stamps placed on them. The outcry was so great that the new tax was quickly withdrawn, but its repeal was soon followed by a series of other tax acts, such as the Townshend Acts (1767), which imposed taxes on many everyday objects such as glass, tea, and paint.

[.my2]
第一部激起殖民地居民愤怒的税收, 是 1765 年通过的《 印花税法》 。该法规定几乎所有纸制品，例如文凭、地契、合同和报纸，都必须贴上印花税票。民众的强烈抗议, 迫使这项新税很快被废除。然而，紧随其后的是一系列其他税收法案，例如 1767 年的 《汤森法案 》。该法案对玻璃、茶叶和油漆等许多日常用品征税。

The taxes imposed by the Townshend Acts were as poorly received by the colonists as the Stamp Act had been. The Massachusetts legislature sent a petition to the king asking for relief from the taxes and requested that other colonies join in a boycott of British manufactured goods. British officials threatened to suspend the legislatures of colonies that engaged in a boycott and, in response to a request for help from Boston’s customs collector, sent a warship to the city in 1768. A few months later, British troops arrived, and on the evening of March 5, 1770, an altercation erupted outside the customs house. Shots rang out as the soldiers fired into the crowd (Figure 2.3). Several people were hit; three died immediately. Britain had taxed the colonists without their consent. Now, British soldiers had taken colonists’ lives.

[.my2]
**"汤森法案"征收的税款, 与"印花税法案"一样，都遭到了殖民地居民的强烈反对。马萨诸塞州议会向国王递交请愿书，请求减免税款，并呼吁其他殖民地, 加入抵制英国制造商品的行列。英国官员威胁要暂停"参与抵制行动的殖民地议会"的运作，并应波士顿海关官员的请求，于 1768 年派遣一艘军舰前往波士顿。**几个月后，英军抵达。1770 年 3 月 5 日晚，海关大楼外爆发冲突。士兵向人群开枪（ 图 2.3 ），枪声响起。多人中弹，三人当场死亡。*英国未经殖民地居民同意, 就对其征税，如今，英国士兵又夺走了殖民地居民的生命。*

This newspaper page shows a drawing of a scene from the Boston Massacre.
Figure 2.3 The Sons of Liberty circulated this sensationalized version of the events of March 5, 1770, in order to promote the rightness of their cause; it depicts British soldiers firing on unarmed civilians in the event that became known as the Boston Massacre. Later portrayals would more prominently feature Crispus Attucks, an African American who was one of the first to die. Eight British soldiers were tried for murder as a result of the confrontation.

[.my2]
图 2.3 为了宣扬其事业的正义性，"自由之子组织"散布了这幅耸人听闻的 1770 年 3 月 5 日事件描述；图中描绘了英国士兵向手无寸铁的平民开枪，这一事件后来被称为"波士顿惨案" 。后来的版本更加突出地展现了克里斯帕斯·阿图克斯，这位非裔美国人是最早遇难者之一。冲突导致八名英国士兵被控谋杀。


Following this event, later known as the Boston Massacre, resistance to British rule grew, especially in the colony of Massachusetts. In December 1773, a group of Boston men boarded a ship in Boston harbor and threw its cargo of tea, owned by the British East India Company, into the water to protest British policies, including the granting of a monopoly on tea to the British East India Company, which many colonial merchants resented. This act of defiance became known as the Boston Tea Party. In the 2010s, many who did not agree with the positions of the Democratic or the Republican Party organized themselves into an oppositional group dubbed the Tea Party (Figure 2.4).

[.my2]
在这次后来被称为“波士顿惨案”的事件之后，反抗英国统治的情绪日益高涨，尤其是在马萨诸塞殖民地。1773 年 12 月，一群波士顿男子登上停泊在波士顿港的一艘船，将船上属于"英国东印度公司"的茶叶倾倒入海，以抗议英国的政策，其中包括授予"英国东印度公司"茶叶垄断权——许多殖民地商人对此感到愤慨。  这一反抗行为后来被称为“ 波士顿倾茶事件” 。在 2010 年代，许多不认同民主党或共和党立场的人组织起来，组成了一个名为“ 茶党” （ 图 2.4 ）的反对派团体。


In the early months of 1774, Parliament responded to this latest act of colonial defiance by passing a series of laws called the Coercive Acts, intended to punish Boston for leading resistance to British rule and to restore order in the colonies. These acts virtually abolished town meetings in Massachusetts and otherwise interfered with the colony’s ability to govern itself. This assault on Massachusetts and its economy enraged people throughout the colonies, and delegates from all the colonies except Georgia formed the First Continental Congress to create a unified opposition to Great Britain. Among other things, members of the institution developed a declaration of rights and grievances.

[.my2]
1774 年初，*英国议会针对殖民地最新的反抗行为，通过了一系列被称为 “强制法案” 的法律，旨在惩罚波士顿领导反抗英国统治的行为，并恢复殖民地的秩序。##这些法案实际上废除了马萨诸塞州的城镇会议，并以其他方式干涉了该殖民地的自治能力。##对马萨诸塞州及其经济的打击, 激起了整个殖民地人民的愤怒，#除佐治亚州以外，所有殖民地的代表组成了"第一届大陆会议" ，以建立统一的反抗英国的联盟。会议成员起草了一份权利与诉求宣言。#*

In May 1775, delegates met again in the Second Continental Congress. By this time, war with Great Britain had already begun, following skirmishes between colonial militiamen and British troops at Lexington and Concord, Massachusetts. Congress drafted a Declaration of Causes explaining the colonies’ reasons for rebellion. On July 2, 1776, Congress declared American independence from Britain and two days later signed the Declaration of Independence.

[.my2]
**1775 年 5 月，代表们再次齐聚"第二届大陆会议" 。**此时，殖民地民兵与英军, 在马萨诸塞州的莱克星顿和康科德发生冲突，战争已经爆发。*大陆会议起草了一份 《起因宣言》， 阐述了各殖民地反抗的理由。1776 年 7 月 2 日，"大陆会议"宣布美国脱离英国独立，两天后签署了《 独立宣言》 。*

Drafted by Thomas Jefferson, the Declaration of Independence officially proclaimed the colonies’ separation from Britain. In it, Jefferson eloquently laid out the reasons for rebellion. God, he wrote, had given everyone the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. People had created governments to protect these rights and consented to be governed by them so long as government functioned as intended. However, “whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government.” Britain had deprived the colonists of their rights. The king had “establish[ed] . . . an absolute Tyranny over these States.” Just as their English forebears had removed King James II from the throne in 1689, the colonists now wished to establish a new rule.

[.my2]
*由托马斯· 杰斐逊起草的《 独立宣言》 正式宣告了殖民地脱离英国的独立。##在宣言中，杰斐逊雄辩地阐述了反抗的理由。他写道，上帝赋予每个人生命、自由和追求幸福的权利。人民建立政府是为了保护这些权利，并且只要政府按预期运作，人民就同意接受政府的统治。然而，“任何形式的政府一旦破坏这些目标，人民就有权改变或废除它，并建立新的政府。”## 英国剥夺了殖民地人民的权利。国王“对这些州建立了……绝对的暴政”。正如他们的英国先辈在 1689 年推翻詹姆斯二世国王一样，殖民地人民现在也希望建立新的统治。*

Jefferson then proceeded to list the many ways in which the British monarch had abused his power and failed in his duties to his subjects. The king, Jefferson charged, had taxed the colonists without the consent of their elected representatives, interfered with their trade, denied them the right to trial by jury, and deprived them of their right to self-government. Such intrusions on their rights could not be tolerated. With their signing of the Declaration of Independence (Figure 2.5), the founders of the United States committed themselves to the creation of a new kind of government.

[.my2]
*##杰斐逊随后列举了英国君主滥用权力、辜负臣民的种种行径。他指责国王未经殖民地"民选代表"同意, 便向他们征税，干涉他们的贸易，剥夺他们接受"陪审团"审判的权利，并剥夺他们的自治权。这种对公民权利的侵犯是不可容忍的。##美国建国者们签署了《独立宣言》（ 图 2.5 ），决心建立一种新型的政府。*

Thomas Jefferson explains in the Declaration of Independence why many colonists felt the need to form a new nation. His evocation of the natural rights of man and his list of grievances against the king also served as the model for the Declaration of Sentiments that was written in 1848 in favor of giving women in the United States rights equal to those of men.
