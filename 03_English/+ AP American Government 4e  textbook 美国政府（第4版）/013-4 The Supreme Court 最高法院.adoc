== 释义




The Supreme Court of the United States, sometimes abbreviated SCOTUS, is a one-of-a-kind institution. While a look at the Supreme Court typically focuses on the nine justices themselves, they represent only the top layer of an entire branch of government that includes many administrators, lawyers, and assistants who contribute to and help run the overall judicial system. The Court has its own set of rules for choosing cases, and it follows a unique set of procedures for hearing them. Its decisions not only affect the outcome of the individual case before the justices, but they also create lasting impacts on legal and constitutional interpretation for the future.

美国最高法院 （有时缩写为 SCOTUS）是一个独一无二的机构。人们通常关注最高法院的九位大法官，但他们仅仅代表了整个政府部门的最高层，该部门还包括众多行政人员、律师和助理，他们共同参与并协助整个司法系统的运作。最高法院有一套独特的案件选择规则，并遵循一套独特的审理程序。其判决不仅影响大法官审理的个案结果，而且对未来的法律和宪法解释产生深远的影响。

THE STRUCTURE OF THE SUPREME COURT
最高法院的结构
The original court in 1789 had six justices, but Congress set the number at nine in 1869, and it has remained there ever since. There is one chief justice, who is the lead or highest-ranking judge on the Court, and eight associate justices. All nine serve lifetime terms, after successful nomination by the president and confirmation by the Senate. There was discussion of expanding the court during Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency and also during the 2020 presidential election. Nothing has come of court expansion, however.

[.my2]
1789 年最初的最高法院有六名大法官，但国会在 1869 年将大法官人数定为九名，并一直沿用至今。最高法院有一名首席大法官 ，他是最高法院的首席法官或最高级别法官，另有八名大法官 。 所有九名大法官均终身任职，由总统提名，参议院确认。在富兰克林·罗斯福总统任期内以及 2020 年总统选举期间，都曾讨论过扩充最高法院的规模。然而，最终并未实现。

The current court is fairly diverse in terms of gender, religion (Christians and Jews), ethnicity, and ideology, as well as length of tenure. Some justices have served for three decades, whereas others were only recently appointed by President Trump. Figure 13.9 lists the names of the nine justices serving on the Court as of June 2021 along with their year of appointment and the president who nominated them.

[.my2]
目前的最高法院在性别、宗教（基督教和犹太教）、种族、意识形态以及任期长短方面都相当多元化。一些大法官已任职三十年，而另一些则是近期由特朗普总统任命的。 图 13.9 列出了截至 2021 年 6 月在任的九位大法官的姓名、任命年份以及提名他们的总统。

A chart titled “Appointments of the Current Supreme Court Justices”. A horizontal timeline runs through the center of the chart. Starting from the left, the first point marked on the line is labeled “Clarence Thomas, Appointed by George H. W. Bush in 1991”. The label is colored red to indicate conservative. The second point is labeled “John Roberts (Chief), Appointed by George W. Bush in 2005”. The label is colored red to indicate conservative. The third point is labeled “Samuel Alito, Appointed by George W. Bush in 2006”. The label is colored red to indicate conservative. The fourth point is labeled “Sonia Sotomayor, Appointed by Barack Obama in 2009”. The label is colored blue to indicate liberal. The fifth point is labeled “Elena Kagan, Appointed by Barack Obama in 2010”. The label is colored blue to indicate liberal. The sixth point is labeled “Neil Gorsuch, Appointed by Donald Trump in 2017”. The label is colored red to indicate conservative. The seventh point is labeled “Brett Kavanaugh, Appointed by Donald Trump in 2018”. The label is colored red to indicate conservative. The eighth point is labeled “Amy Coney Barrett, Appointed by Donald Trump in 2020”. The label is colored red to indicate conservative. The ninth point is labeled “Ketanji Brown Jackson, Appointed by Joseph Biden in 2022”. The label is colored blue to indicate liberal.

Currently, there are six justices who are considered part of the Court’s more conservative wing—Chief Justice Roberts and Associate Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett—while three are considered more liberal-leaning—Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan (Figure 13.10).

目前，最高法院有六位大法官被认为是较为保守的派系——首席大法官罗伯茨和副大法官托马斯 、 阿利托 、 戈萨奇 、 卡瓦诺和巴雷特 ——而三位大法官则被认为是较为自由的派系——大法官布雷耶、 索托马约尔和卡根 （ 图 13.10 ）。

In fact, none of the justices works completely in an ideological bubble. While their numerous opinions have revealed certain ideological tendencies, they still consider each case as it comes to them, and they don’t always rule in a consistently predictable or expected way. Furthermore, they don’t work exclusively on their own. Each justice has three or four law clerks, recent law school graduates who temporarily work for the justice, do research, help prepare the justice with background information, and assist with the writing of opinions. The law clerks’ work and recommendations influence whether the justices will choose to hear a case, as well as how they will rule. As the profile below reveals, the role of the clerks is as significant as it is varied.

事实上，没有一位大法官完全脱离意识形态而独立行事。尽管他们的众多判决意见揭示了某些意识形态倾向，但他们仍然会根据具体案件的情况做出判决，而且他们的判决并非总是遵循既定的模式。此外，他们并非单打独斗。每位大法官都有三到四名法律助理，这些助理都是刚从法学院毕业的应届毕业生，他们为大法官提供临时工作，负责研究、协助大法官准备背景资料以及撰写判决意见。法律助理的工作和建议会影响大法官是否受理案件以及他们的判决结果。如下文所述，法律助理的角色既重要又多样。

Insider Perspective  内部视角
Profile of a United States Supreme Court Clerk
美国最高法院书记员简介
A Supreme Court clerkship is one of the most sought-after legal positions, giving “thirty-six young lawyers each year a chance to leave their fingerprints all over constitutional law.”48 A number of current and former justices were themselves clerks, including Chief Justice John Roberts, Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan, and former chief justice William Rehnquist.

[.my2]
最高法院书记员职位是最受欢迎的法律职位之一，每年为“36 名年轻律师提供在宪法领域留下自己印记的机会” 。48 许多现任和前任大法官都曾担任过书记员，包括首席大法官约翰·罗伯茨、大法官斯蒂芬·布雷耶和埃琳娜·卡根，以及前首席大法官威廉·伦奎斯特。

Supreme Court clerks are often reluctant to share insider information about their experiences, but it is always fascinating and informative to hear about their jobs. Former clerk Philippa Scarlett, who worked for Justice Stephen Breyer, describes four main responsibilities:49
最高法院书记员通常不愿分享有关他们工作的内部信息，但了解他们的工作总是令人着迷且受益匪浅。曾为斯蒂芬·布雷耶大法官工作的书记员菲利帕· 斯嘉丽描述了四项主要职责： 49

Review the cases: Clerks participate in a “cert. pool” (short for writ of certiorari, a request that the lower court send up its record of the case for review) and make recommendations about which cases the Court should choose to hear.

[.my2]
审查案件： 书记员参与“ 调卷令池”（即调卷令的简称，要求下级法院将案件记录提交上级法院审查），并就法院应选择审理哪些案件提出建议。

Prepare the justices for oral argument: Clerks analyze the filed briefs (short arguments explaining each party’s side of the case) and the law at issue in each case waiting to be heard.

[.my2]
为法官们进行口头辩论做准备： 书记员分析已提交的诉讼摘要（简短的辩论，解释案件的每一方观点）以及每个待审案件中涉及的法律。

Research and draft judicial opinions: Clerks do detailed research to assist justices in writing an opinion, whether it is the majority opinion or a dissenting or concurring opinion.

[.my2]
研究和起草司法意见： 书记员进行详细的研究，以协助法官撰写意见，无论是多数意见、反对意见还是赞同意见。

Help with emergencies: Clerks also assist the justices in deciding on emergency applications to the Court, many of which are applications by incarcerated people to stay their death sentences and are sometimes submitted within hours of a scheduled execution.

[.my2]
紧急情况下的帮助： 书记员还会协助法官决定向法院提出的紧急申请，其中许多申请是被监禁的人请求暂缓执行死刑，有时甚至是在预定执行死刑的几个小时内提交的。

HOW THE SUPREME COURT SELECTS CASES
最高法院如何选择案件
The Supreme Court begins its annual session on the first Monday in October and ends late the following June. Every year, there are literally thousands of people who would like to have their case heard before the Supreme Court, but the justices will select only a handful to be placed on the docket, which is the list of cases scheduled on the Court’s calendar. The Court typically accepts fewer than 2 percent of the as many as ten thousand cases it is asked to review every year.50
最高法院每年十月的第一个星期一开始开庭，次年六月下旬结束。每年都有成千上万的人希望自己的案件提交最高法院审理，但大法官们只会挑选少数案件列入审理日程 ，也就是法院日程表上的案件清单。通常情况下，最高法院每年受理的案件不到一万件，而受理案件的比例不到 2 %。

Case names, written in italics, list the name of a petitioner versus a respondent, as in Roe v. Wade, for example.51 For a case on appeal, you can tell which party lost at the lower level of court by looking at the case name: The party unhappy with the decision of the lower court is the one bringing the appeal and is thus the petitioner, or the first-named party in the case. For example, in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), Oliver Brown was one of the thirteen parents who brought suit against the Topeka public schools for discrimination based on racial segregation.

[.my2]
案件名称以斜体字标示，列出原告和被告的姓名，例如罗诉韦德案 （Roe v. Wade） 。 51 对于上诉案件，可以通过案件名称判断下级法院败诉的一方：对下级法院判决不满的一方提起上诉，因此是原告，即案件中列名的第一方。例如，在布朗诉教育委员会案（Brown v. Board of Education ，1954 年）中，奥利弗·布朗是起诉托皮卡公立学校种族隔离歧视的十三位家长之一。

Most often, the petitioner is asking the Supreme Court to grant a writ of certiorari, a request that the lower court send up its record of the case for review. Once a writ of certiorari (cert. for short) has been granted, the case is scheduled on the Court’s docket. The Supreme Court exercises discretion in the cases it chooses to hear, but four of the nine justices must vote to accept a case. This is called the Rule of Four.

[.my2]
通常情况下，申请人请求最高法院签发调卷令 ，即要求下级法院将案件卷宗移送最高法院审查。一旦调卷令（简称 “调卷令 ”）获得批准，案件就会被列入最高法院的审理日程。最高法院在选择审理哪些案件方面拥有自由裁量权，但九名大法官中必须有四名投票通过才能受理案件。这被称为 “四人规则” 。

For decisions about cert., the Court’s Rule 10 (Considerations Governing Review on Writ of Certiorari) takes precedence.52 The Court is more likely to grant certiorari when there is a conflict on an issue between or among the lower courts. Examples of conflicts include (1) conflicting decisions among different courts of appeals on the same matter, (2) decisions by an appeals court or a state court conflicting with precedent, and (3) state court decisions that conflict with federal decisions. Occasionally, the Court will fast-track a case that has special urgency, such as Bush v. Gore in the wake of the 2000 election.53
对于调卷令申请的决定，法院第 10 条规则（ 调卷令审查的考量因素）优先适用。 52 当下级法院之间或下级法院对某一问题存在争议时，法院更有可能准予调卷令申请 。争议的例子包括：（1）不同上诉法院对同一事项作出相互矛盾的判决；（2）上诉法院或州法院的判决与先例相冲突；以及（3）州法院的判决与联邦法院的判决相冲突。有时，法院会加快审理具有特殊紧迫性的案件，例如 2000 年大选后的布什诉戈尔案 。 53

Past research indicated that the amount of interest-group activity surrounding a case before it is granted cert. has a significant impact on whether the Supreme Court puts the case on its agenda. The more activity, the more likely the case will be placed on the docket.54 But more recent research broadens that perspective, suggesting that too much interest-group activity when the Court is considering a case for its docket may actually have diminishing impact and that external actors may have less influence on the work of the Court than they have had in the past.55 Still, the Court takes into consideration external influences, not just from interest groups but also from the public, from media attention, and from a very key governmental actor—the solicitor general.

[.my2]
过去的研究表明，案件获得最高法院批准审理前 ， 围绕该案件的利益集团活动量对最高法院是否将该案件列入议程有着显著影响。活动越多，案件被列入议程的可能性就越大。 54 但最近的研究拓宽了这一视角，指出在最高法院考虑将案件列入议程时，利益集团活动过多实际上可能会削弱其影响力，外部行为者对最高法院工作的影响力可能不如以往。 55 尽管如此，最高法院仍然会考虑外部影响，不仅包括利益集团的影响，还包括公众、媒体关注以及一个至关重要的政府机构——司法部长——的影响。

The solicitor general is the lawyer who represents the federal government before the Supreme Court: He or she decides which cases (in which the United States is a party) should be appealed from the lower courts and personally approves each one presented (Figure 13.11). Most of the cases the solicitor general brings to the Court will be given a place on the docket. About two-thirds of all Supreme Court cases involve the federal government.56
联邦副检察长是代表联邦政府在最高法院出庭的律师：他/她决定哪些案件（美国作为一方当事人）应从下级法院提起上诉，并亲自批准提交的每一件案件（ 图 13.11 ）。联邦副检察长提交给最高法院的大多数案件都会被列入审理日程。最高法院审理的案件中，约有三分之二涉及联邦政府。 56

The solicitor general determines the position the government will take on a case. The attorneys of the office prepare and file the petitions and briefs, and the solicitor general (or an assistant) presents the oral arguments before the Court.

[.my2]
司法部长决定政府在案件中将采取的立场。该办公室的律师准备并提交请愿书和辩护状，司法部长（或其助理）在法庭上进行口头辩论。

In other cases in which the United States is not the petitioner or the respondent, the solicitor general may choose to intervene or comment as a third party. Before a case is granted cert., the justices will sometimes ask the solicitor general to comment on or file a brief in the case, indicating their potential interest in getting it on the docket. The solicitor general may also recommend that the justices decline to hear a case. Though research has shown that the solicitor general’s special influence on the Court is not unlimited, it remains quite significant. In particular, the Court does not always agree with the solicitor general, and “while justices are not lemmings who will unwittingly fall off legal cliffs for tortured solicitor general recommendations, they nevertheless often go along with them even when we least expect them to.”57
在其他美国并非原告或被告的案件中，司法部长可以选择以第三方身份介入或发表意见。在案件获得最高法院批准之前，大法官们有时会要求司法部长就案件发表意见或提交诉讼摘要，表明他们可能有意将该案列入审理日程。司法部长也可能建议大法官们拒绝审理某个案件。尽管研究表明，司法部长对最高法院的特殊影响力并非无限，但仍然相当显著。尤其值得注意的是，最高法院并非总是赞同司法部长的意见，“虽然大法官们并非盲从的旅鼠，不会因为司法部长牵强的建议而轻易坠入法律深渊，但他们往往还是会采纳这些建议，即便在我们最意想不到的时候。” 57

Some have credited Donald B. Verrilli, the solicitor general under President Obama, with holding special sway over the five-justice majority ruling on same-sex marriage in June 2015. Indeed, his position that denying same-sex couples the right to marry would mean “thousands and thousands of people are going to live out their lives and go to their deaths without their states ever recognizing the equal dignity of their relationships” became a foundational point of the Court’s opinion, written by then-Justice Anthony Kennedy.58 With such power over the Court, the solicitor general is sometimes referred to as “the tenth justice.”
有人认为，奥巴马总统时期的司法部长唐纳德·B·维里利对 2015 年 6 月五位大法官就同性婚姻作出的多数裁决有着特殊的影响力。事实上，维里利认为，否认同性伴侣的婚姻权意味着“成千上万的人将在他们生命的尽头，甚至在他们去世之前，都无法在其所在州获得平等的婚姻尊严”，这一观点成为了最高法院当时由安东尼·肯尼迪大法官撰写的意见书的核心论点。 58 由于司法部长对最高法院拥有如此大的影响力，他有时也被称为“第十位大法官”。

SUPREME COURT PROCEDURES
最高法院程序
Once a case has been placed on the docket, briefs, or short arguments explaining each party’s view of the case, must be submitted—first by the petitioner putting forth the case, then by the respondent. After initial briefs have been filed, both parties may file subsequent briefs in response to the first. Likewise, people and groups that are not party to the case but are interested in its outcome may file an amicus curiae (“friend of the court”) brief giving their opinion, analysis, and recommendations about how the Court should rule. Interest groups in particular can become heavily involved in trying to influence the judiciary by filing amicus briefs—both before and after a case has been granted cert. And, as noted earlier, if the United States is not party to a case, the solicitor general may file an amicus brief on the government’s behalf.

[.my2]
案件一旦列入审理日程，双方必须提交诉讼摘要 ，即简要陈述各自对案件的看法——首先由提起诉讼的申请人提交，然后由答辩人提交。在提交初始诉讼摘要后，双方均可针对第一份摘要提交后续摘要。同样，并非案件当事人但对案件结果感兴趣的个人和团体可以提交“法庭之友”（ amicus curiae ）意见陈述，就法院应如何裁决提出意见、分析和建议。利益集团尤其可以通过提交“法庭之友” 意见陈述来积极影响司法判决——无论是在案件获得调卷令之前还是之后。此外，如前所述，如果美国并非案件当事人，则由司法部长代表政府提交 “法庭之友” 意见陈述。

With briefs filed, the Court hears oral arguments in cases from October through April. The proceedings are quite ceremonial. When the Court is in session, the robed justices make a formal entrance into the courtroom to a standing audience and the sound of a banging gavel. The Court’s marshal presents them with a traditional chant: “The Honorable, the Chief Justice and the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! [Hear ye!] All persons having business before the Honorable, the Supreme Court of the United States, are admonished to draw near and give their attention, for the Court is now sitting. God save the United States and this Honorable Court!”59 It has not gone unnoticed that the Court, which has defended the First Amendment’s religious protection and the traditional separation of church and state, opens its every public session with a mention of God.

[.my2]
提交诉讼摘要后，最高法院于每年十月至次年四月举行案件的口头辩论 。 庭审程序颇为庄重。开庭时，身着法袍的大法官们会正式进入法庭，旁听席上站着的听众会聆听法槌的敲击声。法庭法警会以传统的口号引荐他们：“尊敬的首席大法官和各位大法官，美国最高法院。请听！请听！请听！所有在尊敬的美国最高法院有事务要处理的人员，请靠近并注意，因为法庭现在开庭。上帝保佑美国和尊敬的最高法院！” 59 值得注意的是，最高法院一直捍卫宪法第一修正案对宗教的保护以及政教分离的传统原则，而它每次公开庭审的开场白都会提及上帝。

During oral arguments, each side’s lawyers have thirty minutes to make their legal case, though the justices often interrupt the presentations with questions. The justices consider oral arguments not as a forum for a lawyer to restate the merits of the case as written in the briefs, but as an opportunity to get answers to any questions they may have.60 When the United States is party to a case, the solicitor general (or one of the solicitor general's assistants) will argue the government’s position; even in other cases, the solicitor general may still be given time to express the government’s position on the dispute.

[.my2]
在口头辩论中，双方律师各有三十分钟时间陈述各自的法律论点，但大法官们经常会打断陈述并提出问题。大法官们认为口头辩论并非律师重述诉讼摘要中案情的场合，而是解答他们可能提出的任何问题的机会。 60 当美国作为诉讼当事人时， 司法部长 （或其助理）将代表政府进行辩论；即使在其他案件中，司法部长也可能被给予时间阐述政府对争议的立场。

When oral arguments have been concluded, the justices have to decide the case, and they do so in conference, which is held in private twice a week when the Court is in session and once a week when it is not. The conference is also a time to discuss petitions for certiorari, but for those cases already heard, each justice may state their views on the case, ask questions, or raise concerns. The chief justice speaks first about a case, then each justice speaks in turn, in descending order of seniority, ending with the most recently appointed justice.61 The judges take an initial vote in private before the official announcement of their decisions is made public.

[.my2]
口头辩论结束后，大法官们必须对案件作出裁决。他们会在法官联席会议上做出裁决，会议每周举行两次（法院开庭期间），休庭期间每周举行一次。会议也是讨论调卷令申请的时间，但对于已经审理过的案件，每位大法官都可以就案件发表意见、提出问题或表达担忧。首席大法官首先发言，然后每位大法官按资历递减的顺序依次发言，最后由最新任命的大法官发言。 61 在正式公布裁决之前，法官们会进行一次内部投票表决。

Oral arguments are open to the public, but cameras are not allowed in the courtroom, so the only picture we get is one drawn by an artist’s hand, an illustration or rendering. Cameras seem to be everywhere today, especially to provide security in places such as schools, public buildings, and retail stores, so the lack of live coverage of Supreme Court proceedings may seem unusual or old-fashioned. Over the years, groups have called for the Court to let go of this tradition and open its operations to more “sunshine” and greater transparency. Nevertheless, the justices have resisted the pressure and remain neither filmed nor photographed during oral arguments.62
口头辩论对公众开放，但法庭内禁止摄像，因此我们看到的画面只能是艺术家手绘的插图或效果图。如今，摄像机似乎无处不在，尤其是在学校、公共建筑和零售商店等场所，用于安保工作，因此最高法院庭审缺乏现场直播可能显得不同寻常或过时。多年来，一些团体一直呼吁最高法院打破这一传统，使其运作更加“公开透明”。然而，大法官们顶住了压力，在口头辩论期间既不进行拍摄也不录像 。62
