== 释义



Participation (n.) in government matters. Although *people may not get (v.) all* that they want, they can achieve many goals /and improve their lives through civic 公民的 engagement 参与；从事. According to the pluralist 多元主义的 theory 理论, government cannot function (v.) 运转；运行 without _active participation_ 积极参与 by at least some citizens. Even if we believe /the elite 精英阶层 make political 政治的 decisions, `主` participation in government through the act of voting 投票 `谓` can change who 后定说明 the members of the elite are.

[.my2]
**"参与政府事务"至关重要。虽然人们未必能如愿以偿，但通过公民参与，他们能够实现许多目标，改善生活。**根据"多元主义理论"，如果没有至少一部分公民的积极参与，政府就无法正常运作。*即使我们认为政治决策是由精英阶层做出的，但通过投票参与政府事务, 也能改变精英阶层的构成。*


=== WHY GET INVOLVED?

[.my2]
为什么要参与？



Are fewer people today active (a.) 积极主动的；定期进行的，起作用的 in politics than in the past? Political scientist 政治科学家 Robert Putnam has argued 主张；认为 that /civic engagement 公民参与 is declining 减少，下降; although many Americans may report (v.) belonging to groups, these groups are usually _large, impersonal 没有人情味的；冷淡的 ones_ with thousands of members. People _who join (v.) groups_ such as _Amnesty (n.v.) 大赦，特赦 International_ 大赦国际（一个国际人权组织） or _Greenpeace_ 绿色和平组织（一个国际环保组织） may *share* (v.)  certain values 价值观 and ideals 理想；信念 *with* other members of the group, but they do not actually *interact (v.) 互动；交流 with* these other members.  +
These organizations 组织 are different from the types of groups 后定说明 Americans used to belong to, like _church 教堂；礼拜仪式；教派，教会 groups_ 教会团体 or _bowling leagues_ 保龄球联盟（由多个保龄球团体组成的组织）.

Although people are still interested in *volunteering (v.) 自愿做；义务做 and working for* the public good 公共利益；公益, they are more interested in *either* working (v.) individually 单独地；独自地 *or* joining large organizations where they have little opportunity 机会 to interact with others.

Putnam considers 考虑；认为 `宾` a number of explanations 解释；说明 for this decline 下降；减少 in small group membership 成员身份；会员资格, including _increased (a.) participation_ 参与 by women in the workforce 劳动力；职场, a decrease 减少 in the number of marriages 婚姻；结合 /and an increase 增加 in divorces 离婚, and the effect 影响；效果 of technological 技术的；科技的 developments 发展, such as the internet, that separate (v.) 使分离；使隔绝 people by allowing them to feel (v.) connected 有联系的；相连的 to others /without *having to* spend time *in their presence* (在场；出席)在…面前；有…在场.

[.my2]
如今参与政治的人数是否比过去少？政治学家罗伯特· 帕特南认为， **"公民参与度"正在下降；**尽管许多美国人声称自己属于某些团体，但这些团体通常规模庞大、缺乏人情味，成员成千上万。 加入诸如"国际特赦组织"或"绿色和平组织"等团体的人, 可能与其他成员拥有某些共同的价值观和理想，但**他们实际上并不与其他成员互动(相当于加入了一个个微信群, 但基本零互动)。这些组织与美国人过去参与的团体类型（例如教会团体, 或保龄球联盟）截然不同。**尽管人们仍然热衷于志愿服务和为公共利益服务，但他们更倾向于单独工作, 或加入大型组织，而这些组织让他们几乎没有机会与他人互动。 +
帕特南认为，**小型团体成员人数下降的原因有很多，包括女性就业率的提高、结婚率的下降, 和离婚率的上升，以及互联网等技术发展的影响**——这些技术使人们无需见面, 也能感受到彼此的联系，**从而加剧了人与人之间的隔阂。 **

Putnam argues that /`主` #a decline# 下降；衰退 in _social capital_ 社会资本 —“the collective 集体的；共同的 value of all ‘social networks’ [those *whom* 后定说明 people *know*] /and the inclinations 倾向；意愿 that arise (v.)  from these networks to do things for each other” — `谓` #accompanies# (v.) 伴随；与……同时发生 this decline 下降；衰退 in membership 成员资格；会员身份 in small, interactive 交互式的；互动的 groups.

`主` Included in _social capital_ `系` are *such things as* _networks of individuals_, a _sense_ that one is part of an entity 实体；机构 larger than oneself, _concern_ 关心；关注 for the collective good 集体利益 and a _willingness_ 乐意；意愿 to help others, and _the ability_ to trust (v.) others and *to work with them* to find solutions to problems.

This, in turn 反过来；转而, has hurt (v.) people’s willingness 乐意；意愿 and ability  *to engage in* representative 代议制的；代表制的 government. If Putnam is correct, this trend  is unfortunate, because `主` becoming active (a.) 积极的；活跃的 in government and community 社区；社群 organizations `系` is important for many reasons.

[.my2]
普特南认为， ##**社会资本 ——“所有‘社交网络’（人们认识的人）的集体价值, 以及由此产生的互助倾向”——的下降, 伴随着小型互动群体成员数量的减少。 社会资本包括人际网络、归属感、对集体利益的关注, 和助人意愿，以及信任他人, 并与他人合作解决问题的能力。反过来，这又削弱了人们参与"代议制政府"的意愿和能力。**##如果普特南的观点正确，那么这种趋势令人遗憾，因为积极参与政府和社区组织, 在很多方面都至关重要。

Some have countered Putnam’s thesis and argue that participation is in better shape than what he portrays. Everett Ladd shows many positive trends in social involvement in American communities that serve to soften some of the declines identified by Putnam. For example, while bowling league participation is down, soccer league participation has proliferated. April Clark examines and analyzes a wide variety of social capital data trends and disputes the original thesis of erosion. Others have suggested that technology has increased connectedness, an idea that Putnam himself has critiqued as not as deep as in-person connections.

[.my2]
一些人反驳了普特南的论点，认为"社会参与"的现状, 比他所描述的要好。埃弗雷特·拉德指出，美国社区的社会参与,呈现出许多积极的趋势，这些趋势有助于缓解普特南所指出的一些衰退现象。例如，虽然保龄球联赛的参与人数有所下降，但足球联赛的参与人数却大幅增长。 阿普里尔 ·克拉克考察并分析了各种"社会资本"数据趋势，并对最初的衰退论点提出了质疑。 另一些人则认为，技术增强了人与人之间的联系， 但普特南本人批评这种观点，认为它不如面对面的交流那样深入 。

Civic engagement can increase the power of ordinary people to influence government actions. Even those without money or connections to important people can influence the policies that affect their lives and change the direction taken by government. U.S. history is filled with examples of people actively challenging the power of elites, gaining rights for themselves, and protecting their interests. For example, slavery was once legal in the United States and large sectors of the U.S. economy were dependent on this forced labor. Slavery was outlawed and enslaved people were granted citizenship because of the actions of abolitionists. Although some abolitionists were wealthy White men, most were ordinary people, including men and women of both races. White women and African Americans were able to actively assist in the campaign to end slavery despite the fact that, with few exceptions, they were unable to vote. Similarly, the right to vote once belonged solely to White men until the Fifteenth Amendment gave the vote to African American men. The Nineteenth Amendment extended the vote to include women, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 made exercising the right to vote a reality for Black men and women in the South. None of this would have happened, however, without the efforts of people who marched in protest, participated in boycotts, delivered speeches, wrote letters to politicians, and sometimes risked arrest in order to be heard (Figure 1.8). The tactics used to influence the government and effect change by abolitionists and members of the women’s rights and African American civil rights movements are still used by many activists today.

[.my2]
**"公民参与"可以增强普通民众影响政府决策的能力。**即使是那些没有金钱或人脉的人，也能影响关乎自身生活的政策，**并改变政府的决策方向。#美国历史上充满了民众积极挑战精英权力、争取自身权利、维护自身利益的例子。#**例如，奴隶制在美国曾经合法，美国经济的很大一部分, 都依赖于这种强迫劳动。**由于废奴主义者的努力，奴隶制被废除，**被奴役者获得了公民权。虽然一些废奴主义者是富有的白人男性，但大多数是普通民众，包括不同种族的男女。**白人女性和非裔美国人尽管几乎没有投票权，却仍然积极参与了废除奴隶制的运动。**同样，在第十五修正案赋予非裔美国男性投票权之前，投票权也一度只属于白人男性。第十九修正案将"投票权"扩大到女性，1965 年的《投票权法案》使南方黑人男女真正享有投票权。然而，*#如果没有那些走上街头抗议、参与抵制、发表演讲、给政客写信，有时甚至冒着被捕的风险发出声音的人们的努力，这一切都不会发生#*（ 图 1.8 ）。*废奴主义者、妇女权利运动, 和非裔美国人民权运动成员 用来影响政府、促成变革的策略，至今仍被许多活动家所沿用。*

A print from 1870 that shows several scenes of African Americans participating in everyday activities. Under the scenes is the text “The Fifteenth Amendment”.
Figure 1.8 The print above, published in 1870, celebrates the extension of the right to vote to African American men. The various scenes show legal rights that enslaved people did not have.

[.my2]
图 1.8 上图为 1870 年出版的版画，旨在庆祝非裔美国男性获得选举权。画中描绘的场景展现了奴隶们所不享有的各项法律权利。


The rights gained by these activists and others have dramatically improved the quality of life for many in the United States. Civil rights legislation did not focus solely on the right to vote or to hold public office; it also integrated schools and public accommodations, prohibited discrimination in housing and employment, and increased access to higher education. Activists for women’s rights fought for, and won, greater reproductive freedom for women, better wages, and access to credit. Only a few decades ago, homosexuality was considered a mental disorder, and intercourse between consenting adults of the same sex was illegal in many states. Although legal discrimination against LGBTQ people still remains, consensual intercourse between gay and lesbian adults is no longer illegal anywhere in the United States, same-sex couples have the right to legally marry, and LGBTQ people are better protected against employment discrimination.

[.my2]
*#这些活动家和其他人争取到的权利, 极大地改善了许多美国人的生活质量。#*"民权立法"并非仅仅关注"投票权"或"担任公职"的权利；它还促进了学校和公共场所的种族融合，禁止"住房和就业方面的歧视"，并增加了接受高等教育的机会。 **妇女权利活动家,为女性争取并赢得了更大的生育自由、更高的工资, 和获得信贷的机会。**仅仅几十年前，同性恋还被视为一种精神疾病，许多州都禁止成年人之间自愿的同性性行为。尽管针对 LGBTQ 人群的法律歧视依然存在，但在美国，成年人之间自愿的同性性行为, 已不再违法，同性伴侣享有合法结婚的权利，LGBTQ 人群也得到了更好的就业保护，免受歧视。


Activism can improve people’s lives in less dramatic ways as well. Working to make cities clean up vacant lots, destroy or rehabilitate abandoned buildings, build more parks and playgrounds, pass ordinances requiring people to curb their dogs, and ban late-night noise greatly affects people’s quality of life. The actions of individual Americans can make their own lives better and improve their neighbors’ lives as well.

[.my2]
积极行动, 也能以不那么引人注目的方式改善人们的生活。例如，促使城市清理空地、拆除或修复废弃建筑、建造更多公园和游乐场、通过法令"要求人们约束犬只、禁止深夜噪音等"，都能极大地影响人们的生活质量。美国民众的行动不仅能改善自身的生活，也能改善邻居的生活。

Representative democracy cannot work effectively without the participation of informed citizens, however. Engaged citizens familiarize themselves with the most important issues confronting the country and with the plans different candidates have for dealing with those issues. Then they vote for the candidates they believe will be best suited to the job, and they may join others to raise funds or campaign for those they support. They inform their representatives how they feel about important issues. Through these efforts and others, engaged citizens let their representatives know what they want and thus influence policy. Only then can government actions accurately reflect the interests and concerns of the majority. Even people who believe the elite rule government should recognize that it is easier for them to do so if ordinary people make no effort to participate in public life.

[.my2]
然而，**如果没有知情公民的参与，"代议制民主"就无法有效运作。#积极参与的公民, 会熟悉国家面临的最重要问题，以及不同候选人针对这些问题提出的方案。然后，他们会投票选出自己认为最适合担任这一职务的候选人，并可能与其他人士一起, 为他们支持的候选人筹款, 或开展竞选活动。他们会向代表们 表达自己对重要问题的看法。通过这些努力以及其他途径，积极参与的公民, 能够让代表们了解他们的诉求，从而影响政策。#**只有这样，政府的行动才能准确反映大多数人的利益和诉求。即使是那些认为"精英统治政府"的人也应该认识到，*如果普通民众不积极参与公共生活，精英统治政府就更容易得逞。*

=== PATHWAYS TO ENGAGEMENT

[.my2]
参与途径

People can become civically engaged in many ways, either as individuals or as members of groups. Some forms of individual engagement require very little effort. One of the simplest ways is to stay informed about debates and events in the community, in the state, and in the nation. Awareness is the first step toward engagement. News is available from a variety of reputable sources, such as newspapers like the New York Times; national news shows, including those offered by the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio; and reputable internet sites.

[.my2]
人们可以通过多种方式参与公民事务，既可以作为个人参与，也可以作为团体成员参与。有些个人参与方式,几乎不需要付出任何努力。最简单的方法之一就是了解社区、州和国家层面的辩论和事件。**#"了解"是参与的第一步#(中国就是要封杀民众的知情权, 从而让民众不参与自己国家的政治管理)。**新闻可以从各种权威渠道获取，例如 《纽约时报》 等报纸；公共广播服务公司（PBS）, 和国家公共广播电台（NPR）等国家级新闻节目；以及信誉良好的网站。

Another form of individual engagement is to write or email political representatives. Filing a complaint with the city council is another avenue of engagement. City officials cannot fix problems if they do not know anything is wrong to begin with. Responding to public opinion polls, actively contributing to a political blog, or starting a new blog are all examples of different ways to be involved. It is also inescapable that social media engagement has exploded over the last ten years. Moreover, with the self selection of friend groups and feeds online, bias is mobilized, and we see increasing complaints about fake news.

[.my2]
**个人参与的另一种方式, 是写信或发邮件给政治代表。向市议会投诉也是一种参与途径。如果市政官员一开始就不知道问题所在，就无法解决问题。**参与民意调查、*积极为政治博客撰稿,* 或创建新博客, 都是不同的参与方式。不可否认的是，社交媒体在过去十年中呈爆炸式增长。此外，随着人们在网络上自主选择好友群体和信息流，偏见也随之滋生，我们看到关于虚假新闻的投诉越来越多。

One of the most basic ways to engage with government as an individual is to vote (Figure 1.9). Individual votes do matter. City council members, mayors, state legislators, governors, and members of Congress are all chosen by popular vote. Although the president of the United States is not chosen directly by popular vote but by a group called the Electoral College, the votes of individuals in their home states determine how the Electoral College ultimately votes. Registering to vote beforehand is necessary in most states, but it is usually a simple process, and many states allow registration online. (We discuss voter registration and voter turnout in more depth in a later chapter.)

[.my2]
个人参与政府事务最基本的方式之一就是投票（ 图 1.9 ）。个人的选票至关重要。**##市议员、市长、州议员、州长和国会议员, 都是由"普选"产生的。##虽然美国总统并非由"普选"直接产生，而是由"选举团"选出，但选民在其所在州的投票结果, 最终决定了"选举团"的投票走向。**在大多数州，选民必须事先登记才能投票，但登记过程通常很简单，许多州还允许在线登记。（我们将在后续章节中更深入地讨论选民登记和投票率。）

Voting, however, is not the only form of political engagement in which people may participate. Individuals can engage by attending political rallies, donating money to campaigns, and signing petitions. Starting a petition of one’s own is relatively easy, and some websites that encourage people to become involved in political activism provide petitions that can be circulated through email. Taking part in a poll or survey is another simple way to make your voice heard.

[.my2]
然而，投票并非人们参与政治的唯一方式。个人还可以通过参加政治集会、向竞选活动捐款, 以及签署请愿书, 来参与其中。发起请愿相对容易，一些鼓励人们参与政治活动的网站, 也提供可通过电子邮件传播的请愿书。参与民意调查或问卷调查, 也是表达意见的另一种简单方法。

Votes for Eighteen-Year-Olds

[.my2]
十八岁公民的投票权

Young Americans are often reluctant to become involved in traditional forms of political activity. They may believe politicians are not interested in what they have to say, or they may feel their votes do not matter. However, this attitude has not always prevailed. Indeed, today’s college students can vote because of the activism of college students in the 1960s. Most states at that time required citizens to be twenty-one years of age before they could vote in national elections. This angered many young people, especially young men who could be drafted to fight the war in Vietnam. They argued that it was unfair to deny eighteen-year-olds the right to vote for the people who had the power to send them to war. As a result, the Twenty-Sixth Amendment, which lowered the voting age in national elections to eighteen, was ratified by the states and went into effect in 1971.

[.my2]
美国年轻人往往不愿参与传统的政治活动。他们可能认为,政客们对他们的意见不感兴趣，或者觉得自己的选票无关紧要。然而，这种态度并非一直如此。*事实上，如今的大学生之所以能够投票，要归功于上世纪 60 年代大学生的积极行动。当时大多数州都规定, 公民必须年满 21 岁才能参加全国选举。这激怒了许多年轻人，尤其是那些可能被征召入伍参加越南战争的年轻男性。他们认为，剥夺 18 岁年轻人投票选举(或不选举)"那些有权将他们送上战场的人上台"的权利, 是不公平的。最终，将全国选举投票年龄降低到 18 岁的第二十六修正案获,得各州批准，并于 1971 年生效。*

Are you engaged in or at least informed about actions of the federal or local government? Are you registered to vote? How would you feel if you were not allowed to vote until age twenty-one?

[.my2]
你是否参与或至少了解联邦或地方政府的行动？你是否已登记投票？如果你要到21岁才能投票，你会作何感想？

Some people prefer to work with groups when participating in political activities or performing service to the community. Group activities can be as simple as hosting a book club or discussion group to talk about politics. Coffee Party USA provides an online forum for people from a variety of political perspectives to discuss issues that are of concern to them. People who wish to be more active often work for political campaigns. Engaging in fundraising efforts, handing out bumper stickers and campaign buttons, helping people register to vote, and driving voters to the polls on Election Day are all important activities that anyone can engage in. Individual citizens can also join interest groups that promote the causes they favor.

[.my2]
有些人参与政治活动或服务社区时, 更喜欢以团体形式进行。团体活动可以很简单，比如组织读书会, 或政治讨论小组。美国咖啡党（Coffee Party USA）提供了一个在线论坛，让持有不同政治观点的人们可以讨论他们关心的问题。希望更积极参与的人, 通常会加入政治竞选活动。参与筹款、分发竞选贴纸和徽章、帮助人们登记投票, 以及在选举日开车送选民去投票站，这些都是任何人都可以参与的重要活动。*公民个人也可以加入支持自己所支持事业的利益团体。*

Getting Involved

[.my2]
参与其中

In many ways, the pluralists were right. There is plenty of room for average citizens to become active in government, whether it is through a city council subcommittee or another type of local organization. Civic organizations always need volunteers, sometimes for only a short while and sometimes for much longer.

[.my2]
在许多方面，多元主义者的观点是正确的。普通公民有很多机会积极参与政府事务，无论是通过市议会小组委员会, 还是其他地方组织。**公民组织总是需要志愿者，**有时只需要短期服务，有时则需要长期服务。

For example, Common Cause is a non-partisan organization that seeks to hold government accountable for its actions. It calls for campaign finance reform and paper verification of votes registered on electronic voting machines. Voters would then receive proof that the machine recorded their actual vote. This would help to detect faulty machines that were inaccurately tabulating votes or election fraud. Therefore, one could be sure that election results were reliable and that the winning candidate had in fact received the votes counted in their favor. Common Cause has also advocated that the Electoral College be done away with and that presidential elections be decided solely on the basis of the popular vote.


[.my2]
例如， “共同事业”（Common Cause） 是一个致力于"监督政府行为"的无党派组织。该组织呼吁改革"竞选资金制度"，并对电子投票机记录的选票, 进行纸质核查。这样，选民就能收到机器记录其真实投票的证明。这将有助于发现统计错误, 或选举舞弊的故障机器。因此，人们可以确保选举结果的可靠性，并确保获胜候选人确实获得了所有计入的选票。 “共同事业” 还倡导废除"选举人团制度"，总统选举完全由"普选票"决定。

Political activity is not the only form of engagement, and many people today seek other opportunities to become involved. This is particularly true of young Americans. Although young people today often shy away from participating in traditional political activities, they do express deep concern for their communities and seek out volunteer opportunities. Although they may not realize it, becoming active in the community and engaging in a wide variety of community-based volunteer efforts are important forms of civic engagement and help government do its job. The demands on government are great, and funds do not always exist to enable it to undertake all the projects it may deem necessary. Even when there are sufficient funds, politicians have differing ideas regarding how much government should do and what areas it should be active in. Volunteers and community organizations help fill the gaps. Examples of community action include tending a community garden, building a house for Habitat for Humanity, cleaning up trash in a vacant lot, volunteering to deliver meals to the elderly, and tutoring children in after-school programs (Figure 1.10).

[.my2]
政治活动并非"参与社会事务"的唯一途径，如今许多人都在寻求其他参与机会。对于美国年轻人来说尤其如此。尽管现在的年轻人往往不愿参与传统的政治活动，但他们确实对社区深表关切，并积极寻找志愿服务的机会。 尽管他们可能没有意识到，但**积极参与社区活动, 和各种社区志愿服务, 是重要的公民参与形式，有助于政府履行职责。**政府面临着巨大的压力，资金并非总能满足其开展所有必要项目的需求。**即使资金充足，政治家们对于政府应该承担多少职责, 以及应该在哪些领域发挥作用, 也存在分歧。志愿者和社区组织有助于弥补这些缺口。**社区行动的例子包括：照料社区花园、为“仁人家园”建造房屋、清理空地垃圾、志愿为老年人送餐, 以及在课后辅导项目中辅导儿童（ 图 1.10 ）。

Some people prefer even more active and direct forms of engagement such as protest marches and demonstrations, including civil disobedience. Such tactics were used successfully in the African American civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and remain effective today. Likewise, the sit-ins (and sleep-ins and pray-ins) staged by Black civil rights activists, which they employed successfully to desegregate lunch counters, motels, and churches, have been adopted today by movements such as Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street (Figure 1.11). Other tactics, such as boycotting businesses of whose policies the activists disapproved, are also still common. Along with boycotts, there are now “buycotts,” in which consumers purchase goods and services from companies that give extensively to charity, help the communities in which they are located, or take steps to protect the environment.

[.my2]
有些人更倾向于采取更积极、更直接的参与方式，例如**抗议游行和示威，包括"公民不服从运动" 。这些策略在 20 世纪五六十年代的非裔美国人"民权运动"中, 曾被成功运用，**至今仍然有效。同样，**黑人"民权运动"人士, 曾成功地通过静坐（以及睡梦和祈祷）等方式, 争取取消午餐柜台、汽车旅馆和教堂的种族隔离.**而如今，“黑人的命也是命”（Black Lives Matter）和“占领华尔街”（Occupy Wall Street）等运动, 也沿用了这些策略（ 图 1.11 ）。其他策略，例如抵制那些"被活动人士反对其政策的企业"，也仍然很常见。除了抵制之外，现在还有“购买支持”（buycott）支持性购买（指通过购买其他国家或企业产品来表示对某一国家或企业的抵制的行为），即消费者从那些积极投身慈善事业、帮助所在社区或采取措施保护环境的公司, 购买商品和服务。

Ritchie Torres  .

[.my2]
里奇·托雷斯


In 2013, at the age of twenty-five, Ritchie Torres became the youngest member of the New York City Council and the first gay council member to represent the Bronx (Figure 1.12). Torres became interested in social justice early in his life. He was raised in poverty in the Bronx by his mother and a stepfather who left the family when Torres was twelve. The mold in his family’s public housing apartment caused him to have asthma as a child, and he spent time in the hospital on more than one occasion because of it. His mother’s complaints to the New York City Housing Authority were largely ignored. In high school, Torres decided to become a lawyer, participated in mock trials, and met a young and aspiring local politician named James Vacca. After graduation, he volunteered to campaign for Vacca in his run for a seat on the City Council. After Vacca was elected, he hired Torres to serve as his housing director to reach out to the community on Vacca’s behalf. While doing so, Torres took pictures of the poor conditions in public housing and collected complaints from residents. In 2013, Torres ran for a seat on the City Council himself and won. In November 2020, Torres was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives to represent New York's 15th congressional district. He and Mondaire Jones, who represents NY 17, are the first openly gay Black men elected to Congress. He remains committed to improving housing for the poor.

=== FACTORS OF ENGAGEMENT

[.my2]
参与因素

Many Americans engage in political activity on a regular basis. A survey conducted in 2018 revealed that almost 70 percent of American adults had participated in some type of political action in the past five years. These activities included largely non-personal activities that did not require a great deal of interaction with others, such as signing petitions, expressing opinions on social media, contacting elected representatives, or contributing money to campaigns. During the same period, approximately 30 percent of people attended a local government meeting or a political rally or event, while 16 percent worked or volunteered for a campaign.

许多美国人经常参与政治活动。**2018 年的一项调查显示，近 70% 的美国成年人在过去五年中, 参与过某种形式的政治活动。**这些活动大多是无需与他人进行大量互动的非个人活动，例如签署请愿书、在社交媒体上发表意见、联系民选代表, 或为竞选活动捐款 。 **同期，约 30% 的人参加了地方政府会议、政治集会或活动，而 16% 的人参与了竞选活动的工作或志愿服务。**

Americans aged 18–29 were less likely to become involved in traditional forms of political activity than older Americans. A 2018 poll of more than two thousand young adults by Harvard University’s Institute of Politics revealed that only 24 percent claimed to be politically engaged, and fewer than 35 percent said that they had voted in a primary. Only 9 percent said that they had gone to a political demonstration, rally, or march.31 However, in the 2018 midterm elections, an estimated 31 percent of Americans under thirty turned out to vote, the highest level of young adult engagement in decades.32 In 2020, Harvard's polling showed significant interest in the 2020 presidential campaign and intent to vote. Post-election analysis by Tuft University's Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning & Engagement (CIRCLE) showed a record youth turnout of 53 percent, which was greater even than the historic turnout in the 2008 contest. The young vote swung heavily toward Biden in swing states. And, yet, young voters again participated at lower rates than did other age groups. CIRCLE’s post-2024 election analysis showed voting participation for youth voters down, but with considerable youth vote turnout in swing states and an overall advantage to Vice President Kamala Harris. However, the margin was tighter for Harris in 2024 than for Biden in 2020, and Former President Trump performed overall 10% better with this demographic in 2024 than he did in 2020.

[.my2]
与年长的美国人相比，18 至 29 岁的美国人参与传统政治活动的可能性较低。哈佛大学政治研究所 2018 年对两千多名年轻人进行的一项民意调查显示，只有 24%的人声称自己参与政治，不到 35%的人表示曾在"初选"中投票。只有 9%的人表示参加过政治示威、集会或游行。  然而，在 2018 年中期选举中，估计有 31%的 30 岁以下美国人参与了投票，这是几十年来年轻人参与度最高的一次。  2020 年，哈佛大学的民意调查显示，年轻人对 2020 年总统竞选表现出浓厚的兴趣，并有强烈的投票意愿。塔夫茨大学公民学习与参与信息研究中心（CIRCLE）的"选后分析"显示，青年投票率达到创纪录的 53%，甚至超过了 2008 年大选的历史最高投票率。在摇摆州，年轻选民的选票大多倾向于拜登。然而，年轻选民的投票率再次低于其他年龄组。CIRCLE 对 2024 年大选后的分析显示，年轻选民的投票率有所下降，但在摇摆州，年轻选民的投票率相当高，副总统卡马拉·哈里斯总体上占据优势。不过，哈里斯在 2024 年的领先优势比拜登在 2020 年的领先优势要小，而且前总统特朗普在 2024 年在这一群体中的表现比 2020 年提高了 10% 。

Why are younger Americans less likely to become involved in traditional political organizations? One answer may be that as American politics become more partisan in nature, young people turn away. Committed partisanship, which is the tendency to identify with and to support (often blindly) a particular political party, alienates some Americans who feel that elected representatives should vote in support of the nation’s best interests instead of voting in the way their party wishes them to. When elected officials ignore all factors other than their party’s position on a particular issue, some voters become disheartened while others may become polarized. However, a recent study reveals that it is a distrust of the opposing party and not an ideological commitment to their own party that is at the heart of most partisanship among voters.

[.my2]
为什么年轻的美国人不太愿意参与传统的政治组织？一个可能的答案是，随着美国政治日益党派化，年轻人逐渐疏远了政治。**坚定的党派立场 ，即认同并（往往是盲目地）支持某个特定政党的倾向，疏远了一些美国人，他们认为"民选代表"应该以国家利益为重，而不是按照党派的意愿投票。当"民选官员"在特定问题上只关注本党立场, 而忽略其他所有因素时，一些选民会感到失望，而另一些选民则可能走向极端。然而，最近的一项研究表明，选民"党派立场"的核心, 并非对本党的意识形态忠诚，而是对反对党的不信任。**

Young Americans are particularly likely to be put off by partisan politics. Many Americans under the age of thirty now identify themselves as Independents instead of Democrats or Republicans (Figure 1.13). Instead of identifying with a particular political party, young Americans are increasingly concerned about specific issues, such as same-sex marriage. People whose votes are determined based on single issues are unlikely to vote according to party affiliation.

[.my2]
年轻的美国人尤其容易对"党派政治"感到反感。许多 30 岁以下的美国人, 现在自认为是独立人士，而不是民主党人或共和党人（ 图 1.13 ）。**年轻的美国人不再认同某个特定的政党，而是越来越关注一些具体议题，**例如同性婚姻。 那些投票取决于单一议题的人, 不太可能根据党派归属来投票。

The other factor involved in low youth voter turnout in the past was that younger Americans did not feel that candidates generally tackle issues relevant to their lives. When younger voters cannot relate to the issues put forth in a campaign, such as entitlements for seniors, they lose interest. This dynamic changed somewhat in 2016 as Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders made college costs an issue, even promising free college tuition for undergraduates at public institutions. Senator Sanders enjoyed intense support on college campuses across the United States. After his nomination campaign failed, this young voter enthusiasm faded. Despite the fact that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton eventually took up the free tuition issue, young people did not flock to her as well as they had to Sanders. In the general election, won by Republican nominee Donald Trump, turnout was down and Clinton received a smaller proportion of the youth vote than President Obama had in 2012. In 2020, youth again felt connected with candidates, and that compelled participation throughout the election year. Sanders again galvanized interest, as did Biden and Harris during the general election phase. Student loan debt was a key campaign issue.

[.my2]
过去, **青年选民"投票率低下"的另一个原因是，年轻的美国人普遍认为, 候选人不会关注与他们生活息息相关的问题。当年轻选民无法理解竞选活动中提出的议题，例如老年人福利，他们就会失去兴趣。**2016 年，随着民主党候选人伯尼·桑德斯, 将"大学学费问题"作为竞选议题，甚至承诺公立大学本科生免学费，这种局面有所改变。桑德斯参议员在美国各地的大学校园里, 获得了广泛的支持。然而，在他竞选提名失败后，年轻选民的热情也随之消退。尽管民主党候选人希拉里·克林顿, 最终也提出了免除大学学费的问题，但年轻人对她的支持率, 远不及对桑德斯的支持。在共和党候选人唐纳德·特朗普赢得的大选中，投票率下降，克林顿获得的青年选票比例, 甚至低于奥巴马总统在 2012 年的得票率。 2020 年，**年轻人再次感受到与候选人的联系，这促使他们在整个选举年积极参与投票。**桑德斯再次激发了选民的关注，就像拜登和哈里斯在大选阶段所做的那样。*学生贷款债务, 是竞选中的一个关键议题。*

While some Americans disapprove of partisanship in general, others are put off by the ideology—established beliefs and ideals that help shape political policy—of one of the major parties. This is especially true among the young. While ideological polarization has occurred on both sides of the political spectrum, as some members of the Republican Party have become more ideologically conservative (e.g., opposing same-sex marriage, legalization of certain drugs, immigration reform, gun control, separation of church and state, and access to abortion), those young people who do identify with one of the major parties have in recent years tended to favor the Democratic Party.Of the Americans under age thirty who were surveyed by Harvard in 2024, more tended to hold a favorable opinion of Democrats in Congress than of Republicans, and in the 2024 election, 51 percent of younger voters voted for the Democratic ticket (Figure 1.13). Even those young Americans who identify themselves as Republicans are more liberal on certain issues, such as being supportive of same-sex marriage and immigration reform, than are older Republicans. The young Republicans also may be more willing to see similarities between themselves and Democrats. Once again, support for the views of a particular party does not necessarily mean that someone will vote for members of that party.

[.my2]
虽然一些美国人普遍不赞成党派之争，但也有一些人, 对主要政党之一的意识形态 ——即塑造政治政策的既定信念和理念——感到反感。这种情况在年轻人中尤为突出。尽管政治光谱两端,都出现了意识形态极化，一些共和党成员的意识形态也变得更加保守（例如，反对同性婚姻、某些毒品合法化、移民改革、枪支管制、政教分离以及堕胎权），但近年来，那些认同主要政党之一的年轻人, 往往更倾向于民主党。哈佛大学在 2024 年进行的一项调查显示，在 30 岁以下的美国人中，对国会"民主党人"持好感的人数, 多于对"共和党人"持好感的人数；在 2024 年的选举中，51%的年轻选民投票给了民主党候选人（ 图 1.13 ）。即使是那些自认为是共和党人的年轻美国人，在某些问题上也比年长的共和党人更倾向于自由派立场，例如支持同性婚姻, 和移民改革。年轻的共和党人也可能更愿意看到自己与民主党人之间的相似之处。 然而，支持某个政党的观点, 并不一定意味着会投票给该党的成员。

A chart showing the political affiliations of young Americans. Under the question “When it comes to voting, with which party do you consider yourself to be affiliated?” 40% responded “Democrat” with 22% as “Strong Democrat” and 18% as “not a strong Democrat”. 37% responded “Independent”, with 10% as “Leans Democrat”, 21% as “does not lean either way”, and 5% as “leans Republican”. 21% responded “Republican” with 10% as “not a strong Republican”, and 11% as “Strong Republican”. Under the question “When it comes to most political issues, do you think of yourself as a…?” 32% responded “liberal”, 9% responded “moderate-leaning liberal”, 27% responded “moderate”, 8% responded “moderate-leaning conservative”, and 24% responded “conservative”.

一张图表展示了美国年轻人的政治倾向。在“当谈到投票时，您认为自己属于哪个政党？”这一问题中，40%的人回答“民主党”，22%的人回答“坚定的民主党人”，18%的人回答“并非坚定的民主党人”。37%的人回答“独立人士”，其中10%的人回答“倾向民主党”，21%的人回答“没有倾向”，5%的人回答“倾向共和党”。21%的人回答“共和党人”，其中10%的人回答“并非坚定的共和党人”，11%的人回答“坚定的共和党人”。在“当涉及到大多数政治问题时，您认为自己是……？”这一问题中，32%的人回答“自由派”，9%的人回答“倾向自由派的温和派”，27%的人回答“温和派”，8%的人回答“倾向温和保守派”，24%的人回答“保守派”。


Other factors may keep even those college students who do wish to vote away from the polls. Because many young Americans attend colleges and universities outside of their home states, they may find it difficult to register to vote. In places where a state-issued ID is required, students may not have one or may be denied one if they cannot prove that they paid in-state tuition rates.

[.my2]
其他因素也可能导致那些希望投票的大学生放弃投票。**由于许多美国年轻人就读于本州以外的大学，他们可能发现登记投票很困难。**在一些需要州政府颁发的身份证件的地方，学生可能没有身份证，或者如果无法证明自己支付了州内学费，则可能被拒绝发放这种证件 。


The likelihood that people will become active in politics also depends not only on age but on such factors as wealth and education. In 2020, as was the case in past elections, the percentage of people who reported that they were regular voters grew as levels of income and education increased. Political involvement also depends on how strongly people feel about current political issues. Unfortunately, public opinion polls, which politicians may rely on when formulating policy or deciding how to vote on issues, capture only people’s latent preferences or beliefs. Latent preferences are not deeply held and do not remain the same over time. They may not even represent a person’s true feelings, since they may be formed on the spot when someone is asked a question about which they have no real opinion. Indeed, voting itself may reflect merely a latent preference because even people who do not feel strongly about a particular political candidate or issue vote. On the other hand, intense preferences are based on strong feelings regarding an issue that someone adheres to over time. People with intense preferences tend to become more engaged in politics; they are more likely to donate time and money to campaigns or to attend political rallies. The more money that one has and the more highly educated one is, the more likely one will form intense preferences and take political action.

人们参与政治的可能性, 不仅取决于年龄，还取决于财富和教育等因素。2020 年，*正如以往选举一样，自称经常投票的人的比例, 随着收入和教育水平的提高而增长。*  政治参与度也取决于人们对当前政治议题的感受强度。##**遗憾的是，政治家在制定政策, 或决定投票意向时, 可能会依赖的民意调查，只能反映人们的潜在偏好或信念。潜在偏好并非根深蒂固，也不会随时间推移而保持不变。它们甚至可能无法代表一个人的真实感受，因为它们可能是在被问及一个自己没有真正意见的问题时, 临时形成的。**##事实上，投票本身可能仅仅反映了一种潜在偏好，因为即使是对"特定政治候选人或议题"没有强烈感受的人, 也会投票。另一方面， 强烈的偏好是基于人们对某个议题的强烈感受，并且这种感受会长期存在。拥有强烈偏好的人, 往往会更积极地参与政治；他们更有可能为竞选活动捐献时间和金钱，或参加政治集会。*一个人拥有的财富越多，受教育程度越高，就越有可能形成强烈的政治偏好, 并采取政治行动 。*
