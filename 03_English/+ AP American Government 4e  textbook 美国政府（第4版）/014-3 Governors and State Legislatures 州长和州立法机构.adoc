Public opinion regarding Congress has reached a dismal low, with more than 80 percent of those surveyed in 2014 saying they do not feel most members of Congress deserve to be reelected.28 This attitude stems from partisan rivalry, media coverage that has capitalized on the conflict, fiscal shutdowns, and the general perception that Congress is no longer engaged in lawmaking.

[.my2]
公众对国会的看法已跌至谷底，2014 年的一项调查显示，超过 80%的受访者认为大多数国会议员不值得连任。 28 这种态度源于党派间的竞争、媒体对冲突的炒作、财政停摆以及人们普遍认为国会已不再履行立法职责。

The picture looks quite different at the subnational level, at least where lawmaking is concerned. State representatives and senators have been actively engaged in the lawmaking function, grabbing national attention at times for their controversial and highly partisan policies. Governors have been active in promoting their own policy agendas, either in cooperation with the state legislature or in opposition to it. Among the early 2016 Republican presidential contenders, nine were current or former state governors.29 In the Democratic field in 2020, four current or former state governors pursued the nomination.30 Increasingly, governors are using their office and the policies they have signed into law as a platform to gain national attention and to give voters a sense of their priorities should they ascend to the highest office in the country, the presidency.

[.my2]
在地方层面，至少在立法方面，情况则截然不同。州众议员和参议员积极参与立法工作，其颇具争议且党派色彩浓厚的政策有时甚至会吸引全国关注。各州州长也积极推行各自的政策议程，或与州议会合作，或与之对抗。在 2016 年共和党总统候选人中，有九位是现任或前任州长。 29 而在 2020 年的民主党总统候选人提名中，也有四位现任或前任州长参与角逐。 30 越来越多的州长正利用其职位和已签署成法的政策，作为吸引全国关注的平台，并向选民展示如果他们当选国家最高领导人——总统——将会优先考虑哪些政策。

GOVERNORS IN CHARGE  州长负责
Anyone elected to the office of governor assumes tremendous responsibility overnight. He or she becomes the spokesperson for the entire state and their political party, accepts blame or praise for handling decision-making in times of crisis, oversees the implementation of public policy, and helps shepherd legislation through the lawmaking process. These tasks require a great deal of skill and demand that governors exhibit different strengths and personality traits. Governors must learn to work well with other lawmakers, bureaucrats, cabinet officials, and with the citizens who elected them to office in the first place. The ongoing water crisis in Flint, Michigan, provides a good case in point. The COVID-19 pandemic put every governor in the hot seat as they considered decisions on masks, social distancing, and how to allocate federal funds (Figure 14.9).

任何当选州长的人都会在一夜之间肩负起巨大的责任。他或她成为整个州及其所属政党的发言人，在危机时刻因决策而承担责任或接受赞扬，监督公共政策的实施，并协助推动立法程序。这些任务需要高超的技能，并要求州长展现出不同的优势和个性特征。州长必须学会与其他立法者、官僚、内阁成员以及当初选举他们上任的选民有效合作。密歇根州弗林特市持续不断的水危机就是一个很好的例子。新冠疫情让每位州长都面临严峻的考验，他们需要就口罩、保持社交距离以及如何分配联邦资金等问题做出决策（ 图 14.9 ）。

Governors have tremendous power over the legislative branch because they serve year-round and hold office alone. They also command wide press coverage by virtue of being the leading elected official in their state. Finally, while there are variations in degree across the states, most governors have more power relative to their state legislatures than does the U.S. president relative to the U.S. Congress. State executive power flows from factors such as the propensity of state legislatures to meet for only part of the year and their resulting reliance for information on the governor and his/her administration, stronger formal tools (e.g., line-item vetoes), budget-cutting discretion, and the fact that state legislators typically hold down another job besides that of legislator.

[.my2]
州长对立法机构拥有巨大的权力，因为他们全年任职且独揽大权。作为本州最高民选官员，他们也拥有广泛的媒体关注。最后，尽管各州的权力程度有所不同，但大多数州长相对于本州立法机构的权力，都大于美国总统相对于美国国会的权力。州行政权力源于诸多因素，例如州立法机构通常只在一年中的部分时间召开会议，因此他们更依赖州长及其行政部门的信息；州政府拥有更强大的正式权力工具（例如，逐项否决权）；州政府拥有预算削减的自由裁量权；以及州议员通常除了立法工作外还兼任其他职务。

Three of the governor’s chief functions are to influence the legislative process through an executive budget proposal, a policy agenda, and vetoes. Just as the president gives a State of the Union address once a year, so too do governors give an annual State of the State address before the state legislature (Figure 14.10). In this speech, they discuss economic and political achievements, cite data that supports their accomplishments, and overview the major items on their legislative agenda. This speech signals to members of the state legislature what priorities are high on the governor’s list. Those who share the governor’s party affiliation will work with the governor to see these goals achieved. Given that governors need the cooperation of state legislators to get their bills introduced and steered through the lawmaking process, they make developing good relationships with lawmakers a priority. This can entail helping lawmakers address the concerns of their constituents, inviting legislators to social events and meals, and scheduling weekly meetings with legislative leaders and committee chairs to discuss policy.31
州长的三大主要职能是通过行政预算提案、政策议程和否决权来影响立法程序。正如总统每年发表国情咨文一样，州长也每年向州议会发表州情咨文 （ 图 14.10 ）。在咨文中，州长会阐述经济和政治成就，引用数据佐证这些成就，并概述立法议程上的主要事项。这份咨文向州议会成员表明了州长的优先事项。与州长同属一个党派的议员会与州长合作，共同实现这些目标。鉴于州长需要州议员的合作才能提出法案并推动其在立法程序中顺利通过，因此他们将与议员建立良好的关系作为首要任务。这可能包括帮助议员解决选民的诉求，邀请议员参加社交活动和聚餐，以及安排与立法领导人和委员会主席的每周例会，讨论政策。 31

In addition to providing a basic list of policy priorities, governors also initiate a budget proposal in most states. Here they indicate funding priorities and spell out the amounts that will be appropriated to various state agencies under their discretion. When the economy is strong, governors may find themselves in the enviable position of having a surplus of tax revenue. That allows them some flexibility to decide whether they want to reduce taxes, direct funds toward a new initiative or program, allocate more funds to current programs, restore funds that were cut during times of fiscal distress, or save surplus revenue in a rainy-day account.32 Moreover, when cuts must be made, especially when the legislature is not in session, it is typically the governor or their finance director who makes the call on what gets cut.

[.my2]
除了提供一份基本的政策优先事项清单外，大多数州的州长还会发起预算提案。在提案中，他们会列明资金优先事项，并详细说明将根据自身判断拨给各个州政府机构的金额。经济形势良好时，州长们可能会拥有令人羡慕的税收盈余。这使他们拥有一定的灵活性，可以决定是否减税、将资金用于新的举措或项目、增加现有项目的拨款、恢复在财政困难时期被削减的资金，或者将盈余收入存入应急账户。 此外 ，当必须削减开支时，尤其是在立法机构休会期间，通常是由州长或其财政主管决定哪些项目需要削减。

Having introduced their priorities, the governor will work on the sidelines to steer favored bills through the legislative process. This may entail holding meetings with committee chairs or other influential lawmakers concerning their legislative priorities, working with the media to try to get favorable coverage of legislative priorities, targeting advocacy organizations to maintain pressure on resistant lawmakers, or testifying in legislative hearings about the possible impacts of the legislation.33
州长在提出优先事项后，将采取幕后运作，引导其支持的法案顺利通过立法程序。这可能包括与委员会主席或其他有影响力的立法者会面，讨论他们的立法优先事项；与媒体合作，争取对这些立法优先事项进行有利报道；与倡导组织合作，持续向持反对意见的立法者施压；或在立法听证会上作证，说明相关立法可能产生的影响 。33

Once legislation has made its way through the lawmaking process, it comes to the governor’s desk for signature. If a governor signs the bill, it becomes law, and if the governor does not like the terms of the legislation they can veto, or reject, the entire bill. The bill can then become law only if a supermajority of legislators overrides the veto by voting in favor of the bill. Since it is difficult for two-thirds or more of state legislators to come together to override a veto (it requires many members of the governor’s own party to vote against the governor), the simple act of threatening to veto can be enough to get legislators to make concessions to the governor before the governor will pass the legislation.

[.my2]
法案一旦完成立法程序，就会提交州长签署。如果州长签署，法案即成为法律；如果州长对法案条款不满意，可以否决整个法案。只有当绝大多数议员投票推翻州长的否决时，法案才能生效。由于要获得三分之二或以上的州议员支持才能推翻州长的否决（这需要州长所在政党的许多成员投票反对州长），因此，州长以否决相威胁，就足以迫使议员们做出让步，最终促使州长通过法案。

The ability to veto legislation is just one of the formal powers governors have at their disposal. Formal powers are powers the governor may exercise that are specifically outlined in state constitutions or state law.34 Unlike U.S. presidents, many governors also have additional veto powers at their disposal, which enhances their ability to check the actions of the legislative branch. For instance, most states provide governors the power of the line-item veto. The line-item veto gives governors the ability to strike out a line or individual portions of a bill while letting the remainder pass into law. In addition, approximately 30 percent of governors have the power of an amendatory veto, which allows them to send a bill back to the legislature and request a specific amendment to it. Finally, a small number of governors, including the governor of Texas, also have the power of a reduction veto, which allows them to reduce the budget proposed in a piece of legislation.35
否决权只是州长拥有的正式权力之一。正式权力是指州长可以行使的、在州宪法或州法律中明确规定的权力。 34 与美国总统不同，许多州长还拥有额外的否决权，这增强了他们对立法机构行为的制衡能力。例如，大多数州赋予州长逐项否决权。 逐项否决权允许州长否决法案中的某一行或个别条款，而其余部分则继续生效。此外，约 30%的州长拥有修正否决权 ，允许他们将法案退回立法机构，并要求对其进行特定修改。最后，包括德克萨斯州州长在内的少数州长还拥有削减否决权 ，允许他们削减法案中提出的预算。 35

The Vanna White and Frankenstein Vetoes in Wisconsin
威斯康星州的瓦娜·怀特和弗兰肯斯坦否决权
Although the line-item, reduction, and amendatory vetoes give governors tremendous power to adjust legislation and to check the legislative branch, the most powerful and controversial vetoes, which have allowed governors to make selective deletions from a bill before signing, are dubbed the “Vanna White” veto and the “Frankenstein” veto. (Vanna White hosts the popular game show “Wheel of Fortune,” in which contestants guess what a phrase is based on a limited number of letters. As they guess the letters, White indicates the correct letters within the puzzle.) These powers have a colorful history in the state of Wisconsin, where voters have limited their influence on two occasions.

[.my2]
尽管逐项否决权、削减否决权和修正否决权赋予州长极大的权力来调整立法并制衡立法机构，但最强大也最具争议的否决权——允许州长在签署法案前选择性地删除法案内容——被称为“瓦娜·怀特否决权”和“弗兰肯斯坦否决权”。（瓦娜·怀特是热门游戏节目《幸运之轮》的主持人，该节目要求参赛者根据有限的字母猜测短语的意思。在他们猜测的过程中，怀特会在谜题中指出正确的字母。）这些权力在威斯康星州有着一段颇具戏剧性的历史，该州选民曾两次限制了这些权力的影响力。

The first occurred in 1990 when voters passed a provision restricting the governor’s ability to use the “Vanna White” veto to change a bill by crossing out specific letters within a given word in order to create a new word. After this restriction took effect, the “Frankenstein” veto came into practice, which allowed a governor to remove individual words, numbers, or passages from a bill and string the remaining text together (like the fictional Dr. Frankenstein’s monster) in an effort to alter the original intent of the legislation.36
第一次发生在 1990 年，当时选民通过了一项条款，限制州长使用“瓦娜·怀特”否决权来修改法案，即通过划掉特定单词中的字母来创造新词。这项限制生效后，“弗兰肯斯坦”否决权开始实施，允许州长从法案中删除单个单词、数字或段落，并将剩余文本重新组合（就像虚构的弗兰肯斯坦博士的怪物一样），试图改变立法的初衷。 36

As an example of the Frankenstein veto, when an appropriations bill was sent to Wisconsin governor James E. Doyle for signature in 2005, Doyle scrapped over seven hundred words from a passage that would have appropriated millions of dollars to transportation. The words that remained in the bill redirected those funds to education. Lawmakers were outraged, but they were not able to override the veto.37
以“弗兰肯斯坦式否决”为例，2005 年，当一项拨款法案送交威斯康星州州长詹姆斯·E· 多伊尔签署时，多伊尔删去了其中七百多个字，这些字原本将拨款数百万美元用于交通运输。法案中保留下来的文字将这些资金重新分配给了教育。立法者对此感到愤怒，但他们无力推翻州长的否决 。37

Then, in 2007, Governor Doyle used the veto once again to raise property taxes almost 2 percent.38 As a result of these controversial moves, the state house and senate passed a referendum to end the ability of governors to create a new sentence by combining words from two or more other sentences. A legislative referendum is a measure passed by the state legislature, such as a constitutional amendment, that goes to the voters for final approval.39 This referendum went to the voters for approval or rejection in the 2008 election, and the voters banned the practice. Governors in Wisconsin and all the states still have tremendous power to shape legislation, however, through the other types of vetoes discussed in this chapter.

[.my2]
随后，在 2007 年，州长多伊尔再次动用否决权，将房产税提高了近 2%。 38 由于这些争议性举措，州议会通过了一项全民公投，终止州长通过组合两个或多个句子中的词语来创造新句子的权力。立法公投是指州立法机构通过的措施（例如宪法修正案），需要提交给选民进行最终批准。 39 这项公投在 2008 年的选举中进行表决，选民最终否决了这种做法。然而，威斯康星州以及所有州的州长仍然拥有巨大的权力来影响立法，这可以通过本章讨论的其他类型的否决权来实现。

Should any state governor have the powers referred to as the “Vanna White” and “Frankenstein” vetoes? What advantage, if any, might state residents gain from their governor’s ability to alter the intent of a bill the legislature has approved and then sign it into law?
任何州长是否应该拥有被称为“瓦娜·怀特”和“弗兰肯斯坦”否决权的权力？如果州长有权改变立法机关批准的法案的意图，然后将其签署成为法律，那么州居民会从中获得什么好处（如果有的话）？

Besides the formal power to prepare the budget and veto legislation, governors also have the power to call special sessions of the legislature for a wide array of reasons. For instance, sessions may be called to address budgetary issues during an economic downturn, to put together a redistricting plan, or to focus intensively on a particular issue the governor wants rectified immediately.40 In some states, only the governor has the power to call a special session, while in other states this power is shared between the legislative and the executive branches.

[.my2]
除了编制预算和否决立法的正式权力外，州长还有权出于各种原因召集立法机关特别会议。例如，在经济衰退期间，州长可以召集会议来处理预算问题；也可以制定选区重划方案；或者集中精力解决州长希望立即纠正的特定问题。在一些州，只有州长有权召集特别会议； 而在另一些州，这项权力由立法和行政部门共同行使。

Although governors have a great deal of power in the legislative arena, this is not their only area of influence. First, as leaders in their political party, governors often work to raise money for other political figures who are up for reelection. A governor who has high public approval ratings may also make campaign appearances on behalf of candidates in tough reelection fights across the state. Governors can draw in supporters, contributions, and media attention that can be beneficial to other political aspirants, and the party will expect them to do their part to ensure the greatest possible number of victories for their candidates. Second, as the spokesperson for their state, governors make every effort to sell the state’s virtues and unique characteristics, whether to the media, to other citizens across the United States, to potential business owners, or to legislative leaders in Washington, DC. Governors want to project a positive image of their state that will encourage tourism, relocation, and economic investment within its boundaries. Collectively, governors make a mark through the National Governors Association, which is a powerful lobbying force in the nation’s capital.

尽管州长在立法领域拥有巨大的权力，但这并非他们唯一的影响力领域。首先，作为政党领袖，州长们常常致力于为其他面临连任竞选的政治人物筹集资金。一位拥有高支持率的州长也可能代表州内其他选情胶着的候选人出席竞选活动。州长们能够吸引支持者、捐款和媒体关注，这对其他政治候选人大有裨益，而他们的政党也期望他们尽己所能，确保本党候选人赢得尽可能多的胜利。其次，作为本州的代言人，州长们竭尽全力宣传本州的优势和独特之处，无论是面向媒体、全美民众、潜在的企业主，还是华盛顿特区的立法领导人。州长们希望塑造本州的正面形象，以促进旅游业发展、人口迁移和经济投资。此外，州长们还通过全国州长协会发挥集体影响力，该协会是首都华盛顿一股强大的游说力量。

For example, Texas governor Greg Abbott made headlines in 2015 for writing to the CEO of General Electric (GE), urging the company to relocate its corporate headquarters from Connecticut, which had just raised its corporate tax rate, to Texas.41 As his state’s spokesperson, Abbott promoted Texas’s friendly corporate tax structure and investment in transportation and education funding in hopes of enticing GE to relocate there and bring economic opportunities with it. The company has since decided to relocate to Boston, after receiving incentives, worth up to $145 million, from Massachusetts officials.42 Another example involved Texas governor Rick Perry touring California in 2014 in order to bring prospective businesses from the Golden State to Texas. In what was arguably the biggest round of lobbying by state and local governments toward a big business, Amazon recently conducted a search for a second corporate headquarters. After months of consideration, hundreds of op-eds extolling the virtues of locating in particular communities, Amazon picked two sites—Arlington, Virginia and Long Island City, New York—where it plans to spend over $2 billion at each site.43
例如，2015 年，德克萨斯州州长格雷格 ·阿博特致信通用电气（GE）首席执行官，敦促该公司将其总部从刚刚提高企业税率的康涅狄格州迁至德克萨斯州，此事一度成为新闻头条。 41 作为德克萨斯州的发言人，阿博特大力宣传德克萨斯州友好的企业税收政策以及对交通和教育的投入，希望以此吸引通用电气迁至德克萨斯州，并带来经济发展机遇。在获得马萨诸塞州官员提供的价值高达 1.45 亿美元的激励措施后，通用电气最终决定迁往波士顿。 42 另一个例子是，2014 年，德克萨斯州州长里克· 佩里访问加利福尼亚州，旨在吸引来自加州的潜在企业落户德克萨斯州。最近，亚马逊公司开始寻找其第二个总部，这可以说是州政府和地方政府为吸引大型企业而开展的最大规模的游说活动。经过数月的考量，以及数百篇赞扬在特定社区选址优势的评论文章之后，亚马逊最终选定了两个地点——弗吉尼亚州阿灵顿和纽约长岛市——并计划在每个地点投资超过 20 亿美元 。43

In March 2015, the governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, and the mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, both sent letters to corporate heads in Indiana after controversy erupted around the passage of that state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act.44 This bill is designed to restrict government intrusion into people’s religious beliefs unless there is a compelling state interest. It also provides individuals and businesses with the ability to sue if they feel their religious rights have been violated. However, opponents feared the law would be used as a means to discriminate against members of the LGBTQ community, based on business owners’ religious objections to providing services for same-sex couples.45 In the media firestorm that followed the Indiana law’s passage, several prominent companies announced they would consider taking their business elsewhere or cancelling event contracts in the state if the bill were not amended.46 This led opportunistic leaders in the surrounding area to make appeals to these companies in the hope of luring them out of Indiana. Ultimately, the bill was clarified, likely due in part to corporate pressure on the state to do so.47 The clarification made it clear that the law could not be used to refuse employment, housing, or service based on an individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity.48
2015 年 3 月，弗吉尼亚州州长特里· 麦考利夫和芝加哥市长拉姆 ·伊曼纽尔在印第安纳州通过 《宗教自由恢复法案》 引发争议后，分别致信该州多家企业负责人。 44 该法案旨在限制政府干预民众的宗教信仰，除非存在令人信服的州政府利益。它还赋予个人和企业在认为自身宗教权利受到侵犯时提起诉讼的权利。然而，反对者担心该法案会被用来歧视 LGBTQ 群体，因为企业主可能出于宗教原因拒绝为同性伴侣提供服务。 45 在印第安纳州法案通过后引发的媒体风暴中，几家知名公司宣布，如果该法案不进行修改，他们将考虑将业务转移到其他地方或取消在该州的活动合同。 46 这导致周边地区的一些投机分子向这些公司发出游说，希望将它们引诱出印第安纳州。最终，该法案得到了澄清，这很可能是由于企业界向州政府施压所致。 47 澄清后的法案明确规定，法律不得用于基于个人的性取向或性别认同而拒绝提供就业、住房或服务。 48

Controversial legislation like the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is only one of the many environmental factors that can make or break a governor’s reputation and popularity. Other challenges and crises that may face governors include severe weather, terrorist attacks, immigration challenges, and budget shortfalls.

像《宗教自由恢复法案》这样备受争议的立法只是影响州长声誉和支持率的众多环境因素之一。州长可能面临的其他挑战和危机还包括恶劣天气、恐怖袭击、移民问题和预算短缺。

New Jersey governor Chris Christie gained national attention in 2012 over his handling of the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, which caused an estimated $65 billion worth of damage and cost the lives of over 150 individuals along the East Coast of the United States.49 Christie was famously photographed with President Obama during their joint tour of the damaged areas, and the governor subsequently praised the president for his response (Figure 14.11). Some later criticized Christie for his remarks because of the close proximity between the president’s visit and Election Day, along with the fact that the Republican governor and Democratic president were from opposite sides of the political aisle. Critics felt the governor had betrayed his party and that the publicity helped the president win reelection.50 Others praised the governor for cooperating with the president and reaching across the partisan divide to secure federal support for his state in a time of crisis.51
2012 年，新泽西州州长克里斯· 克里斯蒂因其对飓风桑迪灾后重建的处理而受到全国关注。这场飓风给美国东海岸造成了约 650 亿美元的损失，并夺去了 150 多人的生命。 49 克里斯蒂与奥巴马总统一同视察灾区，并合影留念。随后，克里斯蒂州长赞扬了总统的应对措施（ 图 14.11 ）。然而，由于总统的访问与选举日临近，且共和党州长和民主党总统分属不同的政治阵营，一些人批评克里斯蒂的言论。批评者认为州长背叛了自己的党派，而此次事件的曝光反而帮助总统赢得了连任。 50 另一些人则赞扬州长与总统合作，跨越党派分歧，在危机时刻为新泽西州争取到了联邦政府的支持。 51

If severe winter weather is forecasted or in the event of civil unrest, governors also have the power to call upon the National Guard to assist residents and first responders or aid in storm recovery (Figure 14.12). When governors declare a state of emergency, National Guard troops can be activated to go into local areas and assist with emergency efforts in whatever capacity they are needed.52 In 2015, many governors in the New England region called press conferences, worked with snow-removal crews and local government officials, set up emergency shelters, and activated travel bans or curfews in the face of crippling snowstorms.53 When winter storms fail to bring predicted levels of snow, however, politicians can be left to field criticism that they instigated unnecessary panic.54 However, it is a potential catch-22 because if storms end up worse than expected, elected leaders get hammered. For example, a lengthy freeze in south Texas, where even one winter day below freezing is highly unusual, led to a tragic disaster when electrical capacity failed, water pipes froze, and supplies of drinking water were deemed unsafe. A total of 111 people died during the episode and the Texas power grid was within minutes of a total collapse; government officials mandated blackouts, even as people experienced below freezing temperatures.55 Governors feel the weight of their decisions as they try to balance the political risks of overreacting and the human costs of letting the state be caught unprepared for these and other major natural disasters. As the chief spokesperson, they take all the blame or all the credit for their actions. With that said, it is important to note that presidents can enlist the National Guard for federal service as well.

如果预报有严寒的冬季天气或发生社会动荡， 州长也有权召集国民警卫队协助居民和应急人员，或参与风暴灾后重建（ 图 14.12 ）。当州长宣布进入紧急状态时，国民警卫队部队可以被调动到当地，以任何所需的方式协助紧急救援工作。 52 2015 年，面对严重的暴风雪，新英格兰地区的许多州长召开新闻发布会，与除雪人员和地方政府官员合作，设立紧急避难所，并启动旅行禁令或宵禁。 53 然而，如果冬季风暴的降雪量未达到预期，政客们可能会面临指责，认为他们煽动了不必要的恐慌。 54 然而，这可能是一个两难困境，因为如果风暴最终比预期更严重，民选领导人将受到猛烈抨击。例如，德克萨斯州南部遭遇了一场持续的严寒天气，即使在冬季，气温低于冰点也极为罕见。这场严寒导致电力系统瘫痪、水管冻结，饮用水供应被认为不安全，酿成悲剧。事件中共有 111 人丧生，德克萨斯州的电网险些彻底崩溃；尽管民众正经历着冰点以下的严寒，政府官员仍然下令停电。55 位州长深感其决策的重担，他们既要权衡过度反应带来的政治风险，又要考虑因应对此类及其他重大自然灾害准备不足而造成的人员伤亡。作为首席发言人，他们要么承担全部责任，要么获得全部赞誉。 也就是说，值得注意的是，总统也可以征召国民警卫队服役于联邦政府。

Governors also have the power to spare or enhance the lives of individuals convicted of crimes in their state. Although they may choose to exercise this formal power only during the closing days of their term, if at all, most governors have the authority to grant pardons just as U.S. presidents do. A pardon absolves someone of blame for a crime and can secure their release from prison. Governors can also commute sentences, reducing the time an individual must serve,56 if there are doubts about the person’s guilt, concerns about mental health, or reason to feel the punishment was inappropriately harsh. In the past ten years, the governors of New Jersey and Illinois have commuted the sentences of all inmates on death row before repealing the death penalty in their states.57
州长也有权赦免或改善本州罪犯的命运。尽管他们可能只会在任期即将结束时行使这项正式权力（如果行使的话），但大多数州长都拥有与美国总统相同的赦免权。 赦免可以免除某人的罪责，并确保其获释。州长还可以减刑，缩短服刑时间， 56 如果对某人的罪行存在疑问、对其精神健康状况感到担忧，或认为刑罚过重。在过去的十年里，新泽西州和伊利诺伊州的州长在废除本州死刑之前，都曾减免过所有死刑犯的刑期。 57

Despite the tremendous formal powers that go with the job, being governor is still personally and professionally challenging. The demands of the job are likely to restrict time with family and require forgoing privacy. In addition, governors will often face circumstances beyond their control. For instance, the state legislature may include a majority of members who do not share the governor’s party affiliation. This can make working together more challenging and lead to less cooperation during the legislative session. Another challenge for governors is the plural executive, which refers to the fact that many state officials, such as the lieutenant governor, attorney general, and secretary of state are elected independently from the governor; hence, the governor has no direct control over them the way a president might have sway over U.S. executive officials. Governors can also face spending restrictions due to the economic climate in their state. They may have to make unpopular decisions that weaken their support among voters. The federal government can mandate that states perform some function without giving them any funds to do so. Finally, as we saw above, governors can be swept up in crises or natural disasters they did not anticipate and could not have foreseen. This can drain their energy and hamper their ability to generate good public policy.58
尽管州长拥有巨大的正式权力，但担任州长在个人和职业方面仍然充满挑战。这份工作的要求很可能限制州长与家人相处的时间，并要求他们放弃隐私。此外，州长常常会面临一些无法掌控的情况。例如，州议会的大多数成员可能与州长属于不同的党派。这会使合作更加困难，并导致立法会议期间合作减少。州长面临的另一个挑战是行政权力多元化，这意味着许多州级官员，例如副州长、总检察长和州务卿，都是独立于州长选举产生的；因此，州长无法像总统对美国行政官员那样直接控制他们。州长还可能因本州的经济状况而面临支出限制。他们可能不得不做出一些不受欢迎的决定，从而削弱选民的支持。联邦政府可以强制各州履行某些职能​​，却不提供任何资金。最后，正如我们前面所看到的，州长们可能会被卷入他们始料未及、也无法预见的危机或自然灾害中。这会耗尽他们的精力，并妨碍他们制定良好的公共政策 。58

THE FUNCTIONS OF STATE LEGISLATURES
州立法机构的职能
State legislatures serve three primary functions. They perform a lawmaking function by researching, writing, and passing legislation. Members represent their districts and work to meet requests for help from citizens within it. Finally, legislatures perform an oversight function for the executive branch.

[.my2]
州议会主要履行三项职能。首先，它们通过研究、撰写和通过立法来履行立法职能。其次，议员代表各自选区，努力满足选区内公民的诉求。最后，州议会还对行政部门履行监督职能。

All state representatives and senators serve on committees that examine, research, investigate, and vote on legislation that relates to the committee’s purpose, such as agriculture, transportation, or education. The number of bills introduced in any given session varies. Some state legislatures have more restrictive rules concerning the number of bills any one member can sponsor. Legislators get ideas for bills from lobbyists of various types of interest groups, ranging from corporate groups to labor unions to advocacy organizations. Ideas for bills also come from laws passed in other state legislatures, from policy that diffuses from the federal government, from constituents or citizens in the officeholder’s district who approach them with problems they would like to see addressed with new laws, and from their own personal policy agenda, which they brought to office with them. Finally, as we explored previously, legislators also work with the governor’s agenda in the course of each legislative session, and they must pass a budget for their state either every year or every two years.

[.my2]
所有州众议员和参议员都需在相关委员会任职，这些委员会负责审查、研究、调查并投票表决与委员会宗旨相关的立法，例如农业、交通或教育等领域。每届会议提出的法案数量不尽相同。一些州议会对每位议员可提出的法案数量有更严格的规定。议员们从各类利益集团的游说者那里获得法案灵感，这些利益集团包括企业集团、工会和倡导组织等。法案灵感还来源于其他州议会通过的法律、联邦政府的政策、选区内选民或公民提出的、希望通过新法律解决的问题，以及议员自身上任时就已制定的政策议程。最后，正如我们之前探讨过的，议员们在每个立法会议期间还要配合州长的议程，并且必须每年或每两年通过本州的预算。

Most bills die in committee and never receive a second or third reading on the floor of the legislature. Lawmaking requires frequent consensus, not just among the legislators in a given house but also between the two chambers. In order for a bill to become law, it must pass through both the state house and the state senate in identical form before going to the governor’s desk for final signature.

[.my2]
大多数法案在委员会阶段就夭折了，从未在立法机构全体会议上进行二读或三读。立法过程需要频繁达成共识，不仅在同一院的议员之间，而且在两院之间也需要达成共识。一项法案要想成为法律，必须以完全相同的形式分别经州众议院和州参议院通过，然后才能提交州长签署生效。

Besides generating public policy, state legislatures try to represent the interests of their constituents. Edmund Burke was a political philosopher who theorized that representatives are either delegates or trustees.59 A delegate legislator represents the will of those who elected the legislator to office and acts in their expressed interest, even when it goes against personal belief about what is ultimately in the constituency’s best interest. On the other hand, trustees believe they were elected to exercise their own judgment and know best because they have the time and expertise to study and understand an issue. Thus, a trustee will be willing to vote against the desire of the constituency so long as the trustee believes it is in the people’s best interest. A trustee will also be more likely to vote by conscience on issues that are personal to the trustee, such as on same-sex marriage or abortion rights.

[.my2]
除了制定公共政策外，州议会还努力代表选民的利益。政治哲学家埃德蒙·伯克提出，代表要么是委托人，要么是受托人。 59 委托人代表选民的意愿，并按照选民的意愿行事，即使这与选民的最终最佳利益相悖。另一方面， 受托人认为自己当选是为了运用自己的判断力，并且因为他们有时间和专业知识来研究和理解某个问题，所以他们最了解情况。因此，只要受托人认为这样做符合人民的最佳利益，他们就愿意投票反对选民的意愿。受托人也更有可能在与自身相关的问题上凭良心投票，例如同性婚姻或堕胎权。

Regardless of whether representatives adopt a delegate or a trustee mentality, they will all see it as their duty to address the concerns and needs of the people they represent. Typically, this will entail helping members in the district who need assistance or have problems with the government they want addressed. For instance, a constituent may write an elected official asking for help dealing with the bureaucracy such as in a decision made by tax commission, requesting a letter of recommendation for acceptance into a military academy, or proposing a piece of legislation the member can help turn into a law.

[.my2]
无论代表们采取的是委托人心态还是受托人心态，他们都会将解决其所代表人民的诉求和需求视为己任。通常，这意味着帮助选区内需要帮助或希望解决政府相关问题的选民。例如，选民可能会写信给民选官员，请求其协助处理税务委员会的决策等繁琐的行政事务；请求其提供申请入读军校的推荐信；或者提出一项议员可以协助其最终通过的立法提案。

Legislators also try to bring particularized benefits back to their district. These benefits might include money that can be spent on infrastructure improvements or grants for research. Finally, members will accept requests from local government officials or other constituents to attend parades, ribbon-cutting ceremonies, or other celebratory events within their district (Figure 14.13). They will also work with teachers and faculty to visit classes or meet with students on field trips to the state capitol.

[.my2]
立法者们也努力为各自选区争取具体的利益。这些利益可能包括用于基础设施改善的资金或科研经费。此外，议员们还会接受地方政府官员或其他选民的邀请，参加选区内的游行、剪彩仪式或其他庆祝活动（ 图 14.13 ）。他们还会与教师和教职员工合作，走进课堂或在学生前往州议会大厦的实地考察中与他们会面。

The last primary function of state legislators is to oversee the bureaucracy’s implementation of public policy, ensuring it occurs in the manner the legislature intended. State legislatures may request that agency heads provide testimony about spending in hearings, or they may investigate particular bureaucratic agencies to ensure that funds are being disbursed as desired.60 Since legislators have many other responsibilities and some meet for only a few months each year, they may wait to investigate until a constituent or lobbyist brings a problem to their attention.

[.my2]
州议员的最后一个主要职能是监督官僚机构执行公共政策，确保政策按照立法机关的意图执行。州议会可以要求各机构负责人出席听证会，就支出情况作证，也可以对特定官僚机构进行调查，以确保资金按预期拨付。由于议员们身兼多职，而且有些议员每年只开会几个月，他们可能会等到选民或游说者提出问题后才展开调查。

THE COMPOSITION OF STATE LEGISLATURES
州立法机构的组成
In most states, the legislative function is divided between two bodies: a state house and a state senate. The only exception is Nebraska, which has a unicameral state senate of forty-nine members. State legislatures vary a great deal in terms of the number of legislators in the house and senate, the range of diversity across the membership, the partisan composition of the chamber relative to the governor’s affiliation, and the degree of legislative professionalism. This variation can lead to differences in the type of policies passed and the amount of power legislatures wield relative to that of the governor.

[.my2]
在大多数州，立法职能由州众议院和州参议院两个机构分担。唯一的例外是内布拉斯加州，该州设有由49名议员组成的一院制州参议院。各州立法机构在众议院和参议院的议员人数、议员构成多样性、议院党派构成与州长党派的对比以及立法机构的专业化程度等方面差异很大。这种差异会导致各州通过的政策类型以及立法机构相对于州长所拥有的权力大小有所不同。

According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, at forty members, Alaska’s is the smallest state (or lower) house, while New Hampshire’s is the largest at four hundred. State senates range in size from twenty members in Alaska to sixty-seven members in Minnesota. The size of the institution can have consequences for the number of citizens each member represents; larger bodies have a smaller legislator-to-constituent ratio (assuming even populations). Larger institutions can also complicate legislative business because reaching consensus is more difficult with more participants.61
根据全国州议会联合会的数据，阿拉斯加州议会（或称下议院）是规模最小的州议会，仅有 40 名议员；而新罕布什尔州议会规模最大，有 400 名议员。各州参议院的议员人数从阿拉斯加州的 20 人到明尼苏达州的 67 人不等。机构规模会影响每位议员所代表的选民人数；规模较大的机构，其议员与选民的比例较小（假设人口数量相等）。此外，规模较大的机构也会使立法工作更加复杂，因为参与者越多，达成共识就越困难。 61

The term length in the state house is frequently two years, while in the state senate it is more commonly four years. These differences have consequences, too, because representatives in the state house, with the next election always right around the corner, will need to focus on their reelection campaigns more frequently than senators. On the other hand, state senators may have more time to focus on public policy and become policy generalists because they each must serve on multiple committees due to their smaller numbers.

[.my2]
州众议院议员的任期通常为两年，而州参议院议员的任期则更为常见，为四年。这些差异也会带来一些影响，因为州众议院议员由于下一次选举总是近在眼前，需要比参议员更频繁地投入到竞选连任的活动中。另一方面，由于参议员人数较少，他们每人必须在多个委员会任职，因此可能有更多时间专注于公共政策，成为政策通才。

各州议员人数和任期长短不一。

In 2025, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, women made up 32.43 percent, or nearly one-third, of the nation’s state legislators. However, the number varies a great deal across states (Figure 14.14). For instance, in Arizona and Vermont, women account for around 42 percent of the state legislative membership. However, they make up less than 20 percent of the legislatures in Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia.62
根据全国州议会联合会的数据，到 2025 年，女性占全国州议员总数的 32.43%，接近三分之一。然而，各州之间的比例差异很大（ 图 14.14 ）。例如，在亚利桑那州和佛蒙特州，女性约占州议员总数的 42%。但在阿拉巴马州、阿肯色州、密西西比州、南卡罗来纳州、田纳西州和西弗吉尼亚州，女性议员的比例不到 20%。 62

Data on minority representatives is more difficult to obtain, but 2019 estimates from Emory University professor Beth Reingold paired with census estimates from 2019 show that African Americans and Latinos are both underrepresented in state government relative to their percentage of the population. In 2009, African Americans made up 9.3 percent of state legislators, compared to the 13.4 percent of the population they constitute nationwide. On the other hand, Latino representatives made up 4.4 percent of state legislators, despite accounting for 18.5 percent of the total population in the United States.63 , 64 The proportion of Latinos in the legislature is highest in Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas, while the proportion of African Americans is highest in Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi.

[.my2]
少数族裔代表的数据更难获取，但埃默里大学教授贝丝·雷戈尔德 (Beth Reingold) 2019 年的估算数据，结合 2019 年的人口普查数据，显示非裔美国人和拉丁裔在州政府中的代表性均低于其人口比例。2009 年，非裔美国人在州议员中占比 9.3%，而他们在全国人口中的占比为 13.4%。另一方面，拉丁裔代表在州议员中占比仅为 4.4%，尽管他们占美国总人口的 18.5%。 63 , 64 拉丁裔在州议会中的比例在亚利桑那州、加利福尼亚州、新墨西哥州和德克萨斯州最高，而非裔美国人的比例在阿拉巴马州、佐治亚州和密西西比州最高。

Scholars in political science have spent a great deal of time researching the impact of women and minorities on the legislative process and on voter participation and trust. Some research demonstrates that female and minority representatives are more likely to advocate for policies that are of interest to or will benefit minorities, women, and children.65 Other research suggests that the presence of African American and Latino representatives increases voter turnout by these groups.66 Thus, increased diversity in state legislatures can have consequences for voter engagement and for the type of legislation pursued and passed within these bodies.

[.my2]
政治学学者花费大量时间研究女性和少数族裔对立法程序、选民参与度和信任度的影响。一些研究表明，女性和少数族裔代表更有可能倡导那些对少数族裔、妇女和儿童有益或具有利益意义的政策。 65 另一些研究则表明，非裔美国人和拉丁裔代表的存在会提高这些群体的投票率。 66 因此， 州立法机构多元化程度的提高会对选民参与度以及这些机构所推行和通过的立法类型产生影响。

As of early February 2025, twenty-eight had Republican majorities in the state house and senate, while in eighteen states Democratic majorities were the norm. In three states, Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania, party control was split so that the Democratic Party maintained control of one house while the Republican Party maintained control of the other.67 Figure 14.15 illustrates the partisan composition across the United States. Note that states in New England and the West Coast are more likely to be unified behind the Democratic Party, while Republicans control legislatures throughout the South and in large parts of the Midwest. This alignment largely reflects differing political ideologies, with the more liberal, urban areas of the country leaning Democratic while the more conservative, rural areas are Republican.

[.my2]
截至 2025 年 2 月初，28 个州的州议会（众议院和参议院）均由共和党控制，而 18 个州则由民主党控制。在密歇根州、明尼苏达州和宾夕法尼亚州这三个州，两党控制权分散，民主党控制着一院，而共和党控制着另一院。 图 14.15 展示了美国各州的党派构成。值得注意的是，新英格兰和西海岸各州更倾向于团结在民主党周围，而共和党则控制着南部各州和中西部大部分地区的立法机构。这种党派分布很大程度上反映了不同的政治意识形态：较为自由的城市地区倾向于民主党，而较为保守的农村地区则倾向于共和党。

Like diversity, party composition has consequences for policymaking. Governors who are not from the same party as the one controlling the legislature can find it more difficult to achieve their agenda. This governing circumstance is popularly referred to as divided government. In a time of divided government, a governor may have to work harder to build relationships and to broker consensus. In addition, when state party control is divided between the legislative and executive branches, the governor may find that legislators are more likely to muster the numbers to overturn at least some of their vetoes. In contrast, when the governor’s own party controls the legislature—a situation known as unified government—conventional wisdom suggests that they will have a smoother and more productive relationship with the legislature.

[.my2]
与多元化一样，政党构成也会对政策制定产生影响。如果州长与控制立法机构的政党并非同一政党，那么州长实现其施政目标可能会更加困难。这种执政状况通常被称为 “分权政府” 。在分权政府时期，州长可能需要付出更多努力来建立关系并促成共识。此外，当州政党在立法和行政部门之间分属不同部门时，州长可能会发现立法者更有可能获得足够的票数来推翻其部分否决。相反，如果州长所属政党控制立法机构——这种情况被称为 “统一政府” ——通常认为，州长与立法机构的关系会更加顺畅高效。

Party composition also matters for the overall legislative agenda. The party in power will elect party members to the top leadership posts in the state house and senate, and it will determine who sits on each of the committees. Committees are chaired by members of the majority party, and the composition of these committees is skewed toward members affiliated with the party in power. This gives the majority party an advantage in meeting its policy objectives and relegates the minority party to the position of obstructionists. In addition, while Republicans and Democrats are both concerned about education, health care, transportation, and other major policy areas, the two parties have different philosophies about what is in the best interest of their citizens and where funds should be allocated to meet those needs. The result is vastly different approaches to handling pressing public policy problems across the states.

[.my2]
政党构成对整体立法议程也至关重要。执政党将选举本党成员担任州议会和参议院的最高领导职位，并决定各委员会的成员构成。委员会主席由多数党成员担任，而这些委员会的组成往往偏向于与执政党有关联的成员。这使得多数党在实现其政策目标方面占据优势，并将少数党置于阻挠者的位置。此外，尽管共和党和民主党都关注教育、医疗保健、交通和其他重大政策领域，但两党对于何为公民的最佳利益以及如何分配资金以满足这些需求有着不同的理念。其结果是，各州在处理紧迫的公共政策问题时采取了截然不同的方法。

As a whole, state legislatures have become progressively more professional. Political scientist Peverill Squire, at several points throughout his career, has measured the degree of state legislative professionalism with a ranking across the fifty states.68 Legislative professionalism is assessed according to three key factors: state legislators’ salary, the length of time they are in session, and the number of staff at their disposal. Members of professional or full-time legislatures tend to consider legislative service their full-time occupation, and they are paid enough not to require a second occupation. They also have larger staffs to assist with their work, and they tend to be in session for much of the year. On the other end of the spectrum are citizen, or part-time, legislatures. Representatives and senators in these legislatures do not enjoy the same perks as their counterparts in professional legislatures. Generally, salary is much lower and so is staff assistance. Members typically need to seek outside employment to supplement their income from legislative work, and the legislature will meet for only a brief period of time during the year.

[.my2]
总体而言，各州立法机构的专业化程度日益提高。政治学家佩弗里尔· 斯奎尔在其职业生涯中曾多次对美国五十个州的立法机构专业化程度进行排名。 68 立法机构的专业化程度主要根据三个关键因素进行评估：州议员的薪酬、会期长短以及可支配的工作人员数量。专业化或全职立法机构的成员通常将立法工作视为全职职业，他们的薪酬足以维持生计，无需从事其他工作。他们也拥有更多的工作人员协助其工作，并且往往一年中的大部分时间都在会期中。与此相反的是公民立法机构或兼职立法机构。这些机构的众议员和参议员无法享受与专业化立法机构的同行相同的待遇。通常情况下，他们的薪酬和工作人员数量都少得多。议员们通常需要寻找外部工作来补贴立法工作的收入，而且立法机构每年只会召开很短一段时间的会议。

Between these two extremes are hybrid legislatures. Their members are compensated at a higher rate than in citizen legislatures, but they are still likely to need outside employment to make an income equal to what they were making prior to taking office. These representatives and senators will have some staff assistance but not as much as in a professional legislature. Finally, members in hybrid legislatures will not consider their service to constitute a full-time occupation, but they will spend more than part of their time conducting legislative business. As Figure 14.16 shows, California, New York, and Pennsylvania are home to some of the most professional legislatures in the country. On the other hand, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Wyoming, and South Dakota are among the states that rank lowest on legislative professionalism.69
介于这两种极端情况之间的是混合型立法机构。这类机构的成员薪酬高于公民立法机构，但他们仍然可能需要兼职才能维持就职前的收入水平。这些众议员和参议员会获得一些工作人员的协助，但不如职业立法机构那样全面。最后，混合型立法机构的成员不会将他们的服务视为全职工作，但他们会花费相当一部分时间处理立法事务。 如图 14.16 所示，加利福尼亚州、纽约州和宾夕法尼亚州拥有全国最专业的立法机构。另一方面，新罕布什尔州、北达科他州、怀俄明州和南达科他州则是立法专业化程度最低的州之一。 69

A map of the United States titled “Level of Professionalism Within State Legislatures, 2008”. California, Pennsylvania, and New York are marked “Full-time, high salary, large staff”. Alaska, Florida, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, and Massachusetts, are marked “Full-time, moderately high salary, moderately large staff”. Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginal, DC, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Hawaii are marked “Hybrid”. Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Kansas, Mississippi, Georgia, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Maine are marked “Part-time, moderately low salary, moderately small staff”. Montana, Wyoming, Utah, North Dakota, South Dakota, and New Hampshire are marked “Part-time, low salary, low staff”.

[.my2]
Figure 14.16 This map illustrates the degree of professionalism within state legislatures. States in purple and green tend to meet full-time and have larger staff and salaries, while the opposite conditions exist in states colored in orange and red. States in blue fall somewhere in the middle of these conditions.

[.my2]
图 14.16 这张地图展示了各州立法机构的专业化程度。紫色和绿色区域的州往往实行全职运作，拥有更多工作人员和更高薪资；橙色和红色区域的州则相反；蓝色区域的州则介于两者之间。
Like the other indicators discussed above, legislative professionalism also affects the business of state legislatures. In professional legislatures, elections tend to be more competitive, and the cost of running for a seat is higher because the benefits of being elected are greater. This makes these seats more attractive, and candidates will tend not to run unless they perceive themselves as well qualified. Since the benefits are more generous, elected officials will tend to stay in office longer and develop more policy expertise as a result. This experience can give professional legislatures an edge when dealing with the governor, because they are likely to be in session for about the same amount of time per year as the governor and have the necessary staff to assist them with researching and writing public policy.70
与上文讨论的其他指标一样，立法机构的专业化程度也会影响州议会的运作。在专业化的立法机构中，选举往往更具竞争性，竞选席位的成本也更高，因为当选的收益更大。这使得这些席位更具吸引力，候选人往往只有在认为自己完全胜任的情况下才会参选。由于收益更为丰厚，当选官员往往会任职更长时间，从而积累更丰富的政策经验。这种经验可以使专业化的立法机构在与州长打交道时更具优势，因为他们每年的会期可能与州长大致相同，并且拥有必要的幕僚人员协助他们进行公共政策的研究和撰写 。70
