== 释义





Many people criticize the huge amounts of money spent in politics. Some argue that interest groups have too much influence on who wins elections, while others suggest influence is also problematic when interests try to sway politicians in office. There is little doubt that interest groups often try to achieve their objectives by influencing elections and politicians, but discovering whether they have succeeded in changing minds is actually challenging because they tend to support those who already agree with them.

许多人批评政治领域巨额资金的投入。有人认为利益集团对选举结果的影响力过大，也有人指出，当利益集团试图左右在任政客的决策时，这种影响同样存在问题。毫无疑问，利益集团常常试图通过影响选举和政客来实现自身目标，但要判断他们是否成功改变了人们的观念却并非易事，因为他们往往更倾向于支持那些原本就认同他们观点的人。

INFLUENCE IN ELECTIONS  选举中的影响力
Interest groups support candidates who are sympathetic to their views in hopes of gaining access to them once they are in office.65 For example, an organization like the NRA will back candidates who support Second Amendment rights. Both the NRA and the Brady: United Against Gun Violence (an interest group that favors background checks for firearm purchases) have grading systems that evaluate candidates and states based on their records of supporting these organizations.66 To garner the support of the NRA, candidates must receive an A+ rating for the group. In much the same way, Americans for Democratic Action, a liberal interest group, and the American Conservative Union, a conservative interest group, both rate politicians based on their voting records on issues these organizations view as important.67
利益集团支持那些与他们观点相近的候选人，希望在他们上任后能够获得他们的支持。例如，像美国步枪协会（ NRA ）这样的组织会支持那些支持宪法第二修正案权利的候选人。NRA 和“布雷迪：联合反对枪支暴力”（一个支持对枪支购买进行背景调查的利益集团）都设有评分系统，根据候选人和各州对这些组织的支持记录对其进行评估。为了获得 NRA 的支持，候选人必须获得该组织的 A+评级。同样，自由派利益集团“美国民主行动”和保守派利益集团“美国保守联盟”也都会根据政治人物在这些组织认为重要的议题上的投票记录对其进行评级。

These ratings, and those of many other groups, are useful for interests and the public in deciding which candidates to support and which to oppose. Incumbents have electoral advantages in terms of name recognition, experience, and fundraising abilities, and they often receive support because interest groups want access to the candidate who is likely to win. Some interest groups will offer support to the challenger, particularly if the challenger better aligns with the interest’s views or the incumbent is vulnerable. Sometimes, interest groups even hedge their bets and give to both major party candidates for a particular office in the hopes of having access regardless of who wins.

[.my2]
这些评级，以及许多其他团体的评级，对于利益集团和公众决定支持哪些候选人、反对哪些候选人都很有用。现任官员在知名度、经验和筹款能力方面具有选举优势，他们往往能获得支持，因为利益集团希望接触到最有可能获胜的候选人。一些利益集团也会支持挑战者，尤其是在挑战者的观点更符合利益集团的利益，或者现任官员面临挑战的情况下。有时，利益集团甚至会采取对冲策略，同时向同一职位的两个主要政党候选人捐款，希望无论谁最终获胜都能获得支持。

Some interests groups form political action committees (PACs), groups that collect funds from donors and distribute them to candidates who support their issues. As Figure 10.13 makes apparent, many large corporations like Honeywell International, AT&T, and Lockheed Martin form PACs to distribute money to candidates.68 Other PACs are either politically or ideologically oriented. For example, the MoveOn.org PAC is a progressive group that formed following the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, whereas GOPAC is a Republican PAC that promotes state and local candidates of that party. PACs are limited in the amount of money that they can contribute to individual candidates or to national party organizations; they can contribute no more than $5,000 per candidate per election and no more than $15,000 a year to a national political party. Individual contributions to PACs are also limited to $5,000 a year.

[.my2]
一些利益集团会成立政治行动委员会（PAC） ，这些组织从捐赠者那里筹集资金，并将其分配给支持其主张的候选人。如图 10.13 所示，许多大型企业，例如霍尼韦尔国际公司、AT&T 和洛克希德·马丁公司，都成立了 PAC 来向候选人捐款。 68 其他 PAC 则具有政治或意识形态倾向。例如，MoveOn.org PAC 是一个进步团体，成立于比尔·克林顿总统弹劾审判之后；而 GOPAC 则是一个共和党 PAC，旨在支持该党的州和地方候选人。PAC 对可以捐赠给单个候选人或全国性政党组织的金额有限制；每次选举中，每个候选人最多只能捐赠 5,000 美元，每年向全国性政党捐赠的金额最多为 15,000 美元。个人对 PAC 的捐款也限制在每年 5,000 美元以内。

From left to right, the rows read “American Assn for Justice $2,147,500, 96.83% Democrat, 2.33% Republican”, “Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers $2,160,000, 44.70% Democrat, 55.30% Republican”, “Air Line Pilots Assn $2,200,000, 62.02% Democrat, 37.18% Republican”, “Trump 47 Cmte $2,220,530, 0% Democrat, 100.0% Republican”, “National Air Traffic Controllers Assn $2,232,000, 68.01% Democrat, 31.43% Republican”, “American Council of Engineering Cos $2,249,900, 52.27% Democrat, 47.11% Republican”, “Laborers Union $2,253,300, 88.44% Democrat, 10.52% Republican”, “American Federation of State/Cnty/Munic Employees $2,310,500, 98.49% Democrat, 0.43% Republican”, “Machinists/Aerospace Workers Union $2,361,000, 97.20% Democrat, 1.31% Republican”, “Sheet Metal, Air, Rail & Transportation Union $2,462,600, 94.42% Democrat, 5.06% Republican”, “American Bankers Assn $2,470,516, 34.17% Democrat, 65.23% Republican”, “National Auto Dealers Assn $2,552,500, 30.85% Democrat, 68.93% Republican.” At the bottom of the table, a source reads “Center for Responsive Politics. “Top 20 PACs to Candidates, 2023-2024.”.”

PACs through which corporations and unions can spend virtually unlimited amounts of money on behalf of political candidates are called super PACs.69 As a result of a 2010 Supreme Court decision, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, there is no limit to how much money unions or corporations can donate to super PACs. Unlike PACs, however, super PACs cannot contribute money directly to individual candidates. If the 2014 elections were any indication, super PACs will continue to spend large sums of money in an attempt to influence future election results.

[.my2]
企业和工会可以通过政治行动委员会（PAC）向政治候选人投入几乎无限量的资金，这种组织被称为超级政治行动委员会（Super PAC）。 69 由于 2010 年最高法院在“公民联合诉联邦选举委员会案”（Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission） 中的裁决，工会或企业向超级政治行动委员会捐款的金额没有上限。然而，与政治行动委员会不同的是，超级政治行动委员会不能直接向个别候选人捐款。如果 2014 年的选举结果可以作为参考，那么超级政治行动委员会将继续投入巨资，试图影响未来的选举结果。

INFLUENCING GOVERNMENTAL POLICY
影响政府政策
Interest groups support candidates in order to have access to lawmakers once they are in office. Lawmakers, for their part, lack the time and resources to pursue every issue; they are policy generalists. Therefore, they (and their staff members) rely on interest groups and lobbyists to provide them with information about the technical details of policy proposals, as well as about fellow lawmakers’ stands and constituents’ perceptions. These voting cues give lawmakers an indication of how to vote on issues, particularly those with which they are unfamiliar. But lawmakers also rely on lobbyists for information about ideas they can champion and that will benefit them when they run for reelection.70 While voting cues on legislation remain an important pathway of influence, interest groups and their lobbyists can be especially effective in legislative agenda-setting, namely in drafting legislation for lawmakers. While the practice of bill outlines being provided to legislators by interest group lobbyists is a longstanding practice, a 2019 investigation by USA Today, The Arizona Republic, and the Center for Public Integrity showed a trend of entire sections of bills written word-for-word based on lobbyist materials.71
利益集团支持候选人，是为了在他们就职后能够接触到立法者。而立法者本身缺乏时间和资源来处理所有问题；他们是政策通才。因此，他们（及其工作人员）依赖利益集团和游说者提供政策提案的技术细节信息，以及其他立法者的立场和选民的看法。这些投票线索能够帮助立法者了解在哪些问题上应该如何投票，尤其是在他们不熟悉的问题上。但立法者也依赖游说者提供信息，了解哪些理念可以得到他们的支持，并在竞选连任时对他们有利 。尽管立法投票线索仍然是施加影响的重要途径，但利益集团及其游说者在立法议程设置方面尤其有效，尤其是在为立法者起草法案方面。尽管利益集团游说者向立法者提供法案大纲的做法由来已久，但 《今日美国》、《亚利桑那共和报》 和公共诚信中心在 2019 年的一项调查显示，法案中某些章节逐字逐句地照搬游说者提供的材料，这种趋势愈演愈烈 。71

Interest groups likely cannot target all 535 lawmakers in both the House and the Senate, nor would they wish to do so. There is little reason for the Brady: United Against Gun Violence to lobby members of Congress who vehemently oppose any restrictions on gun access. Instead, the organization will often contact lawmakers who are amenable to some restrictions on access to firearms. Thus, interest groups first target lawmakers they think will consider introducing or sponsoring legislation.

[.my2]
利益集团不太可能游说众议院和参议院的全部535名议员，他们也不愿意这样做。“布雷迪：联合反对枪支暴力”组织几乎没有理由去游说那些强烈反对任何枪支管制措施的国会议员。相反，该组织通常会联系那些愿意对枪支获取进行一些限制的议员。因此，利益集团首先会锁定那些他们认为会考虑提出或支持相关立法的议员。

Second, they target members of relevant committees.72 If a company that makes weapons systems wants to influence a defense bill, it will lobby members of the Armed Services Committees in the House and the Senate or the House and Senate appropriations committees if the bill requires new funding. Many members of these committees represent congressional districts with military bases, so they often sponsor or champion bills that allow them to promote policies popular with their districts or state. Interest groups attempt to use this to their advantage. But they also conduct strategic targeting because legislatures function by respectfully considering fellow lawmakers’ positions. Since lawmakers cannot possess expertise on every issue, they defer to their trusted colleagues on issues with which they are unfamiliar. So targeting committee members also allows the lobbyist to inform other lawmakers indirectly.

[.my2]
其次，他们会瞄准相关委员会的成员。 72 如果一家武器系统制造商想要影响一项国防法案，它就会游说众议院和参议院的军事委员会成员，或者如果该法案需要新的资金，则会游说众议院和参议院的拨款委员会成员。这些委员会的许多成员都代表着设有军事基地的国会选区，因此他们经常发起或支持那些能够让他们在其选区或州内推行受欢迎的政策的法案。利益集团试图利用这一点来谋取自身利益。但他们也会进行战略性的目标锁定，因为立法机构的运作方式是尊重地考虑其他议员的立场。由于议员不可能精通所有问题，因此在他们不熟悉的问题上，他们会听取值得信赖的同事的意见。因此，瞄准委员会成员也使游说者能够间接地向其他议员传递信息。

Third, interest groups target lawmakers when legislation is on the floor of the House and/or Senate, but again, they rely on the fact that many members will defer to their colleagues who are more familiar with a given issue. Finally, since legislation must past both chambers in identical form, interest groups may target members of the conference committees whose job it is to iron out differences across the chambers. At this negotiation stage, a 1 percent difference in, say, the corporate income tax rate could mean millions of dollars in increased or decreased revenue or taxation for various interests.

[.my2]
第三，利益集团会在众议院和/或参议院审议法案时向议员施压，但他们同样依赖于这样一个事实：许多议员会听从更熟悉特定议题的同事的意见。最后，由于法案必须以完全相同的形式在两院获得通过，利益集团可能会将目标对准负责协调两院分歧的联席会议委员会成员。在这个谈判阶段，例如，企业所得税税率1%的差异就可能意味着不同利益集团数百万美元的收入或税收增减。

Interest groups also target the budgetary process in order to maximize benefits to their group. In some cases, their aim is to influence the portion of the budget allocated to a given policy, program, or policy area. For example, interests for groups that represent the poor may lobby for additional appropriations for various welfare programs; those interests opposed to government assistance to the poor may lobby for reduced funding to certain programs. It is likely that the legislative liaison for your university or college spends time trying to advocate for budgetary allocations in your state.

[.my2]
利益集团也会将目标对准预算流程，以最大限度地维护自身利益。在某些情况下，他们的目标是影响分配给特定政策、项目或政策领域的预算比例。例如，代表贫困人口的利益集团可能会游说增加对各项福利项目的拨款；而反对政府援助贫困人口的利益集团则可能游说减少某些项目的资金。您所在大学或学院的立法联络员很可能也会花费时间在您所在的州内游说，争取预算拨款。

Interest groups also try to defeat legislation that may be detrimental to their views. For example, when Congress considers legislation to improve air quality, it is not unusual for some industries to oppose it if it requires additional regulations on factory emissions. In some cases, proposed legislation may serve as a disturbance, resulting in group formation or mobilization to help defeat the bill. For example, a proposed tax increase may result in the formation or mobilization of anti-tax groups that will lobby the legislature and try to encourage the public to oppose the proposed legislation. Prior to the election in 2012, political activist Grover Norquist, the founder of Americans for Tax Reform (ATR), asked all Republican members of Congress to sign a “Taxpayer Protection Pledge” that they would fight efforts to raise taxes or to eliminate any deductions that were not accompanied by tax cuts. Ninety-five percent of the Republicans in Congress signed the pledge.73 Some interests arise solely to defeat legislation and go dormant after they achieve their immediate objectives.

[.my2]
利益集团也会试图阻挠可能对其利益不利的立法。例如，当国会审议旨在改善空气质量的法案时，如果该法案要求对工厂排放施加额外监管，一些行业反对该法案的情况并不罕见。在某些情况下，拟议的立法本身就可能成为一种干扰，促使某些团体成立或动员起来，以帮助否决该法案。例如，一项拟议的增税法案可能会导致反税团体的成立或动员，这些团体将游说立法机构，并试图鼓励公众反对该拟议的立法。在 2012 年大选前，政治活动家、美国税制改革协会（ATR）的创始人格罗弗· 诺奎斯特 （Grover Norquist）要求所有共和党国会议员签署一份“纳税人保护承诺书”，承诺他们将反对任何不伴随减税的增税或取消税收抵免的举措。国会中 95%的共和党议员签署了该承诺书。 73 有些利益集团的出现仅仅是为了阻挠立法，并在达到其短期目标后销声匿迹。

Once legislation has been passed, interest groups may target the executive branch of government, whose job is to implement the law. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has some leeway in providing care for military veterans, and interests representing veterans’ needs may pressure this department to address their concerns or issues. Other entities within the executive branch, like the Securities and Exchange Commission, which maintains and regulates financial markets, are not designed to be responsive to the interests they regulate, because to make such a response would be a conflict of interest. Interest groups may lobby the executive branch on executive, judicial, and other appointments that require Senate confirmation. As a result, interest group members may be appointed to positions in which they can influence proposed regulation of the industry of which they are a part.

[.my2]
一旦立法通过，利益集团可能会将目标对准政府行政部门，因为行政部门的职责是执行法律。美国退伍军人事务部在为退伍军人提供医疗保健方面拥有一定的自主权，代表退伍军人利益的团体可能会向该部门施压，要求其解决退伍军人的诉求或问题。行政部门内的其他机构，例如负责维护和监管金融市场的证券交易委员会，其设立目的并非为了回应其监管对象（即相关利益集团）的诉求，因为这样做会构成利益冲突。利益集团可能会就行政、司法和其他需要参议院确认的任命事宜游说行政部门。因此，利益集团成员可能会被任命到能够影响其所属行业监管提案的职位上。

In addition to lobbying the legislative and executive branches of government, many interest groups also lobby the judicial branch. Lobbying the judiciary takes two forms, the first of which was mentioned above. This is lobbying the executive branch about judicial appointments the president makes and lobbying the Senate to confirm these appointments. The second form of lobbying consists of filing amicus briefs, which are also known as “friend of the court” briefs. These documents present legal arguments stating why a given court should take a case and/or why a court should rule a certain way. In Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), the Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, numerous interest groups filed amicus briefs.74 For example, the Human Rights Campaign, shown demonstrating in Figure 10.14, filed a brief arguing that the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process and equal protection clauses required that same-sex couples be afforded the same rights to marry as different-sex couples. In a 5–4 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed.

[.my2]
除了游说立法和行政部门外，许多利益集团还会游说司法部门。游说司法部门有两种形式，第一种形式已在前面提及。这种形式包括游说行政部门反对总统的司法任命，以及游说参议院确认这些任命。第二种游说形式是提交“法庭之友”意见陈述书。这些文件提出法律论据，说明法院为何应该受理某个案件，以及/或者为何应该做出某种判决。在 2015 年最高法院审理的 “奥贝格费尔诉霍奇斯案”（Obergefell v. Hodges ）中，众多利益集团提交了 “ 法庭之友”意见陈述书。该案最终使同性婚姻在全美合法化。例如， 如图 10.14 所示，人权运动组织提交了一份意见陈述书，认为第十四修正案的正当程序和平等保护条款要求赋予同性伴侣与异性伴侣相同的结婚权利。美国最高法院以 5 比 4 的投票结果同意了这一观点。

Measuring the effect of interest groups’ influence is somewhat difficult because lobbyists support lawmakers who would likely have supported them in the first place. Thus, National Right to Life, an anti-abortion interest group, does not generally lobby lawmakers who favor abortion rights; instead, it supports lawmakers and candidates who have professed “pro-life” positions. While some scholars note that lobbyists sometimes try to influence those on the fence or even their enemies, most of the time, they support like-minded individuals. Thus, contributions are unlikely to sway lawmakers to change their views; what they do buy is access, including time with lawmakers. The problem for those trying to assess whether interest groups influence lawmakers, then, is that we are uncertain what would happen in the absence of interest group contributions. For example, we can only speculate what the ACA might have looked like had lobbyists from a host of interests not lobbied on the issue.

[.my2]
衡量利益集团的影响力颇为困难，因为游说者支持的立法者原本就可能支持他们。例如，反堕胎利益集团“全国生命权组织”（National Right to Life）通常不会游说支持堕胎权的立法者；相反，它支持那些公开宣称“支持生命权”的立法者和候选人。虽然一些学者指出，游说者有时会试图影响那些立场摇摆不定的人，甚至是他们的敌人，但大多数情况下，他们支持的是与自己观点相近的人。因此，捐款不太可能改变立法者的观点；他们真正购买的是接触机会，包括与立法者会面的时间。那么，对于那些试图评估利益集团是否影响立法者的人来说，问题在于我们无法确定如果没有利益集团的捐款会发生什么。例如，我们只能推测，如果没有来自各种利益集团的游说者就此问题进行游说，《平价医疗法案》（ACA）最终会是什么样子。
