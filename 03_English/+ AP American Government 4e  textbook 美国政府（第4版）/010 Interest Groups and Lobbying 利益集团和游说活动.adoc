== 释义


The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, represented a substantial overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system.1 Given its potential impact, interest group representatives (lobbyists) from the insurance industry, hospitals, medical device manufacturers, and organizations representing doctors, patients, and employers all tried to influence what the law would look like and the way it would operate. Ordinary people took to the streets to voice their opinion (Figure 10.1). Some state governors sued to prevent a requirement in the law that their states expand Medicaid coverage. A number of interest groups challenged the law in court, where two Supreme Court decisions have left it largely intact.

2010 年的 《患者保护与平价医疗法案 》（ACA），又称奥巴马医改 ，标志着美国医疗保健体系的重大改革。鉴于其潜在影响，来自保险业、医院、医疗器械制造商以及代表医生、患者和雇主的组织的利益集团代表（游说者）都试图影响该法案的最终内容和运作方式。 普通民众也走上街头表达意见（ 图 10.1 ）。一些州长提起诉讼，试图阻止该法案中要求本州扩大医疗补助覆盖范围的条款生效。许多利益集团在法庭上对该法案提出质疑，但最高法院的两项裁决基本维持了该法案的完整性。

Interest groups like those for and against the ACA play a fundamental role in representing individuals, corporate interests, and the public before the government. They help inform the public and lawmakers about issues, monitor government actions, and promote policies that benefit their interests, using all three branches of government at the federal, state, and local levels.

像支持和反对《平价医疗法案》（ACA）的利益集团这样的团体，在代表个人、企业和公众向政府发声方面发挥着至关重要的作用。它们利用联邦、州和地方三个层级的政府部门，帮助公众和立法者了解相关议题，监督政府行为，并推动有利于自身利益的政策。

In this chapter, we answer several key questions about interest groups. What are they, and why and how do they form? How do they provide avenues for political participation? Why are some groups advantaged by the lobbying of government representatives, while others are disadvantaged? Finally, how do interest groups try to achieve their objectives, and how are they regulated?
本章我们将解答关于利益集团的几个关键问题。利益集团是什么？它们为何形成？又是如何形成的？它们如何为政治参与提供途径？为什么有些利益集团能够通过游说政府代表而获益，而另一些利益集团却处于不利地位？最后，利益集团如何努力实现其目标？它们又是如何受到监管的？

Sebelius, in which the Court eventually upheld most provisions of the law. (credit left: modification of work by “Fibonacci Blue”/Flickr; credit right: modification of work by LaDawna Howard)
