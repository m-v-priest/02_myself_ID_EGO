== 释义




The courts are the least covered and least publicly known of the three branches of government. The inner workings of the Supreme Court and its day-to-day operations certainly do not get as much public attention as its rulings, and only a very small number of its announced decisions are enthusiastically discussed and debated. The Court’s 2015 decision on same-sex marriage was the exception, not the rule, since most court opinions are filed away quietly in the United States Reports, sought out mostly by judges, lawyers, researchers, and others with a particular interest in reading or studying them.

[.my2]
在政府三大分支中，法院的报道最少，公众对其了解也最少。最高法院的内部运作和日常运作远不如其判决那样引人注目，只有极少数已公布的判决会引发热烈的讨论和辩论。最高法院 2015 年关于同性婚姻的裁决是个例外，而非普遍现象，因为大多数法院判决都静静地归档在 《美国判例汇编》 中，只有法官、律师、研究人员以及其他对此特别感兴趣的人士才会查阅。

Thus, we sometimes envision the justices formally robed and cloistered away in their chambers, unaffected by the world around them, but the reality is that they are not that isolated, and a number of outside factors influence their decisions. Though they lack their own mechanism for enforcement of their rulings and their power remains checked and balanced by the other branches, the effect of the justices’ opinions on the workings of government, politics, and society in the United States is much more significant than the attention they attract might indicate.

[.my2]
因此，我们有时会想象大法官们身着法袍，隐居在各自的办公室里，与世隔绝，不受外界影响。但事实上，他们并非如此孤立，许多外部因素都会影响他们的判决。尽管他们没有自己的判决执行机制，其权力也受到其他部门的制约，但大法官们的意见对美国政府、政治和社会运作的影响，远比他们所受到的关注程度要大得多。

JUDICIAL OPINIONS  司法意见
Every Court opinion sets precedent for the future. The Supreme Court’s decisions are not always unanimous, however; the published majority opinion, or explanation of the justices’ decision, is the one with which a majority of the nine justices agree. It can represent a vote as narrow as five in favor to four against. A tied vote is rare but can occur at a time of vacancy, absence, or abstention from a case, perhaps where there is a conflict of interest. In the event of a tied vote, the decision of the lower court stands.

[.my2]
每一份最高法院的判决都会为未来树立先例。然而， 最高法院的判决并非总是全票通过；已公布的多数意见 ，即大法官们对判决的解释，是指九位大法官中多数人同意的意见。这种多数意见的票数差距可能小到五票赞成、四票反对。平局的情况很少见，但可能会在大法官空缺、缺席或弃权的情况下发生，也可能在存在利益冲突的情况下发生。如果出现平局，则维持下级法院的判决。

Most typically, though, the Court will put forward a majority opinion. If in the majority, the chief justice decides who will write the opinion. If not, then the most senior justice ruling with the majority chooses the writer. Likewise, the most senior justice in the dissenting group can assign a member of that group to write the dissenting opinion; however, any justice who disagrees with the majority may write a separate dissenting opinion. If a justice agrees with the outcome of the case but not with the majority’s reasoning in it, that justice may write a concurring opinion.

[.my2]
通常情况下，法院会提出多数意见。如果是多数意见，则由首席大法官决定由谁撰写。如果不是，则由与多数意见一致的资深大法官选择撰写人。同样，持异议的法官中资历最深的法官可以指定一名成员撰写异议意见 ；但是，任何不同意多数意见的大法官都可以单独撰写异议意见。如果大法官同意案件结果但不同意多数意见的理由，则可以撰写赞同意见 。

Court decisions are released at different times throughout the Court’s term, but all opinions are announced publicly before the Court adjourns for the summer. Some of the most controversial and hotly debated rulings are released near or on the last day of the term and thus are avidly anticipated (Figure 13.12).

[.my2]
法院判决的公布时间在法院任期内不固定，但所有判决意见都会在法院夏季休庭前公开宣布。一些最具争议和最受关注的判决会在任期临近结束或当天公布，因此备受期待（ 图 13.12 ）。

INFLUENCES ON THE COURT
对法院的影响
Many of the same players who influence whether the Court will grant cert. in a case, discussed earlier in this chapter, also play a role in its decision-making, including law clerks, the solicitor general, interest groups, and the mass media. But additional legal, personal, ideological, and political influences weigh on the Supreme Court and its decision-making process. On the legal side, courts, including the Supreme Court, cannot make a ruling unless they have a case before them, and even with a case, courts must rule on its facts. Although the courts’ role is interpretive, judges and justices are still constrained by the facts of the case, the Constitution, the relevant laws, and the courts’ own precedent.

[.my2]
本章前文讨论过，许多影响最高法院是否受理案件的因素，也同样参与了最高法院的决策过程，包括法官助理、司法部长、利益集团和大众媒体。此外，还有其他法律、个人、意识形态和政治因素影响着最高法院及其决策过程。在法律层面，包括最高法院在内的各级法院，只有在收到案件后才能作出裁决；即使收到案件，法院也必须根据案件事实作出裁决。尽管法院的角色是解释性的，但法官和大法官仍然受到案件事实、宪法、相关法律以及法院自身判例的约束。

Justices’ decisions are influenced by how they define their role as a jurist, with some justices believing strongly in judicial activism, or the need to defend individual rights and liberties, and they aim to stop actions and laws by other branches of government that they see as infringing on these rights. A judge or justice who views the role with an activist lens is more likely to use judicial power to broaden personal liberty, justice, and equality. Still others believe in judicial restraint, which leads them to defer decisions (and thus policymaking) to the elected branches of government and stay focused on a narrower interpretation of the Bill of Rights. These justices are less likely to strike down actions or laws as unconstitutional and are less likely to focus on the expansion of individual liberties. While it is typically the case that liberal actions are described as unnecessarily activist, conservative decisions can be activist as well.

[.my2]
大法官的判决受到他们如何定义自身作为法学家的角色的影响。一些大法官坚信司法能动主义 ，即捍卫个人权利和自由的必要性，他们的目标是阻止其他政府部门实施他们认为侵犯这些权利的行为和法律。以能动主义视角看待自身角色的法官更有可能运用司法权力来扩大个人自由、正义和平等。另一些大法官则信奉司法克制 ，这使他们将决策（以及政策制定）权交给民选的政府部门，并专注于对《权利法案》进行更为狭义的解释。这些大法官不太可能以违宪为由驳回某些行为或法律，也不太可能致力于扩大个人自由。虽然自由派的行动通常被认为是不必要的能动主义，但保守派的判决也可能具有能动性。

Critics of the judiciary often deride activist courts for involving themselves too heavily in matters they believe are better left to the elected legislative and executive branches. However, as Justice Anthony Kennedy has said, “An activist court is a court that makes a decision you don’t like.”63
司法批评者经常嘲讽那些过于干预司法事务的法院，认为这些事务最好留给民选的立法和行政部门处理。然而，正如安东尼· 肯尼迪大法官所说，“激进法院就是做出你不喜欢的判决的法院。” 63

Justices’ personal beliefs and political attitudes also matter in their decision-making. Although we may prefer to believe a justice can leave political ideology or party identification outside the doors of the courtroom, the reality is that a more liberal-thinking judge may tend to make more liberal decisions and a more conservative-leaning judge may tend toward more conservative ones. Although this is not true 100 percent of the time, and an individual’s decisions are sometimes a cause for surprise, the influence of ideology is real, and at a minimum, it often guides presidents to aim for nominees who mirror their own political or ideological image. It is likely not possible to find a potential justice who is completely apolitical.

[.my2]
大法官的个人信仰和政治态度也会影响他们的决策。尽管我们可能更愿意相信大法官能够将政治意识形态或党派认同抛诸脑后，但现实情况是，思想更自由的法官可能倾向于做出更自由的判决，而思想更保守的法官则可能倾向于做出更保守的判决。虽然这种情况并非绝对，而且个人的判决有时也令人意外，但意识形态的影响是真实存在的，至少它常常会引导总统提名与自身政治或意识形态形象相符的人选。找到一位完全不涉政治的潜在大法官几乎是不可能的。

And the courts themselves are affected by another “court”—the court of public opinion. Though somewhat isolated from politics and the volatility of the electorate, justices may still be swayed by special-interest pressure, the leverage of elected or other public officials, the mass media, and the general public. As times change and the opinions of the population change, the court’s interpretation is likely to keep up with those changes, lest the courts face the danger of losing their own relevance.

[.my2]
法院本身也会受到另一个“法庭”——舆论法庭的影响。尽管法官们在某种程度上与政治和选民的情绪波动保持距离，但他们仍然可能受到特殊利益集团的压力、民选官员或其他公职人员的影响力、大众媒体以及公众舆论的影响。随着时代变迁和民意变化，法院的解释也可能需要与时俱进，否则法院将面临失去其自身意义的风险。

Take, for example, rulings on sodomy laws: In 1986, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the State of Georgia’s ban on sodomy,64 but it reversed its decision seventeen years later, invalidating sodomy laws in Texas and thirteen other states.65 No doubt the Court considered what had been happening nationwide: In the 1960s, sodomy was banned in all the states. By 1986, that number had been reduced by about half. By 2002, thirty-six states had repealed their sodomy laws, and most states were only selectively enforcing them. Changes in state laws, along with an emerging LGBTQ movement, no doubt swayed the Court and led it to the reversal of its earlier ruling with the 2003 decision, Lawrence v. Texas (Figure 13.13).66 This decision was an especially important one because it meant all prior and existing laws that formally made same-sex relationships illegal were null and void.

[.my2]
以鸡奸法的裁决为例：1986 年，最高法院维持了佐治亚州禁止鸡奸的合宪性 64 ，但 17 年后，最高法院推翻了这一裁决，宣布德克萨斯州和其他 13 个州的鸡奸法无效 65 。毫无疑问，最高法院考虑了全国范围内的变化：20 世纪 60 年代，所有州都禁止鸡奸。到 1986 年，禁止鸡奸的州减少了约一半。到 2002 年，已有 36 个州废除了鸡奸法，而且大多数州只是选择性地执行这些法律。各州法律的变化，以及 LGBTQ 运动的兴起，无疑影响了最高法院，并最终导致其在 2003 年的 “劳伦斯诉德克萨斯州案”（ 图 13.13 ）中推翻了之前的裁决。 66 这项决定尤其重要，因为它意味着所有先前和现有的正式将同性关系定为非法的法律都无效了。

[.my2]
Figure 13.13 The Supreme Court’s 2003 decision in Lawrence v. Texas that overturned an earlier ruling on sodomy made national headlines and shows that Court rulings can change with the times.

[.my2]
图 13.13 最高法院在 2003 年劳伦斯诉德克萨斯州一案中推翻了之前关于鸡奸的裁决，这一裁决引起了全国关注，也表明法院的裁决会随着时代而改变。
Heralded by advocates of gay rights as important progress toward greater equality, the ruling in Lawrence v. Texas illustrates that the Court is willing to reflect upon what is going on in the world. Even with their heavy reliance on precedent and reluctance to throw out past decisions, justices are not completely inflexible and do tend to change and evolve with the times.

[.my2]
劳伦斯诉德克萨斯州案的裁决被同性恋权利倡导者誉为迈向更大平等的重要一步，它表明最高法院愿意反思世界正在发生的事情。尽管大法官们非常依赖先例，并且不愿推翻过去的判决，但他们并非完全僵化，而是会随着时代而改变和发展。

The Importance of Jury Duty
陪审义务的重要性
Since judges and justices are not elected, we sometimes consider the courts removed from the public; however, this is not always the case, and there are times when average citizens may get involved with the courts firsthand as part of their decision-making process at either the state or federal levels. At some point, if you haven’t already been called, you may receive a summons for jury duty from your local court system. You may be asked to serve on federal jury duty, such as U.S. district court duty or federal grand jury duty, but service at the local level, in the state court system, is much more common.

[.my2]
由于法官并非民选产生，我们有时会认为法院与公众隔绝；然而，情况并非总是如此，普通公民有时也会直接参与到州或联邦层面的决策过程中。如果您尚未收到传票，您可能会在某个时候收到当地法院系统的陪审团传票。您可能会被要求履行联邦陪审义务 ，例如美国地区法院或联邦大陪审团的陪审义务，但在州法院系统的地方层面履行陪审义务则更为常见。

While your first reaction may be to start planning a way to get out of it, participating in jury service is vital to the operation of the judicial system, because it provides individuals in court the chance to be heard and to be tried fairly by a group of their peers. And jury duty has benefits for those who serve as well. You will no doubt come away better informed about how the judicial system works and ready to share your experiences with others. Who knows? You might even get an unexpected surprise, as some citizens in Dallas, Texas did recently when former President George W. Bush showed up to serve jury duty with them.

[.my2]
你或许会第一时间想方设法逃避陪审义务，但参与陪审团服务对司法系统的运作至关重要，因为它让法庭上的每个人有机会陈述案情，并由同侪组成的陪审团进行公正审判。而且，陪审义务对参与者自身也有益处。毫无疑问，你会对司法系统的运作方式有更深入的了解，并乐于与他人分享你的经历。谁知道呢？你甚至可能会收获意想不到的惊喜，就像最近德克萨斯州达拉斯市的一些市民那样，前总统乔治·W·布什突然现身，与他们一同履行陪审义务。

Have you ever been called to jury duty? Describe your experience. What did you learn about the judicial process? What advice would you give to someone called to jury duty for the first time? If you’ve never been called to jury duty, what questions do you have for those who have?
你是否曾被传唤担任陪审员？请描述一下你的经历。你对司法程序有哪些了解？你会给第一次被传唤担任陪审员的人什么建议？如果你从未被传唤担任过陪审员，你有什么问题想问那些被传唤担任过陪审员的人？

THE COURTS AND THE OTHER BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT
法院和政府其他部门
Both the executive and legislative branches check and balance the judiciary in many different ways. The president can leave a lasting imprint on the bench through nominations, even long after leaving office. The president may also influence the Court through the solicitor general’s involvement or through the submission of amicus briefs in cases in which the United States is not a party.

[.my2]
行政和立法部门通过多种方式对司法部门进行制衡。总统可以通过提名对法官席位产生深远影响，即便卸任多年后亦是如此。总统还可以通过司法部长参与案件或在并非美国当事方的案件中提交法庭之友意见陈述来影响最高法院。

President Franklin D. Roosevelt even attempted to stack the odds in his favor in 1937, with a “court-packing scheme” in which he tried to get a bill passed through Congress that would have reorganized the judiciary and enabled him to appoint up to six additional judges to the high court (Figure 13.14). The bill never passed, but other presidents have also been accused of trying similar moves at different courts in the federal system.

[.my2]
1937 年，富兰克林· 罗斯福总统甚至试图通过一项“扩充最高法院法官人数”的计划来增加胜算。他试图让国会通过一项法案，重组司法机构，使他能够向最高法院增派至多六名法官（ 图 13.14 ）。该法案最终未能通过，但其他总统也被指控在联邦法院系统中试图采取类似行动。

Letters across all of the robes read “Packed Court”. A speech bubble above the five people in robes reads “Yes, Yes, we all vote yes!”.

图 13.14 1937 年的一幅漫画讽刺了富兰克林·罗斯福总统（图中右侧人物）的“扩充最高法院”计划。罗斯福未能成功增加最高法院大法官人数，最高法院大法官人数至今仍为九人。
Likewise, Congress has checks on the judiciary. It retains the power to modify the federal court structure and its appellate jurisdiction, and the Senate may accept or reject presidential nominees to the federal courts. Faced with a court ruling that overturns one of its laws, Congress may rewrite the law or even begin a constitutional amendment process.

[.my2]
同样，国会也对司法部门拥有制衡。国会保留修改联邦法院结构及其上诉管辖权的权力，参议院可以接受或否决总统对联邦法院法官的提名。如果法院裁决推翻了国会制定的法律，国会可以重写该法律，甚至启动宪法修正程序。

But the most significant check on the Supreme Court is executive and legislative leverage over the implementation and enforcement of its rulings. This process is called judicial implementation. While it is true that courts play a major role in policymaking, they have no mechanism to make their rulings a reality. Remember it was Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 78 who remarked that the courts had “neither force nor will, but merely judgment.” And even years later, when the 1832 Supreme Court ruled the State of Georgia’s seizing of Native American lands unconstitutional,67 President Andrew Jackson is reported to have said, “John Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it,” and the Court’s ruling was basically ignored.68 Abraham Lincoln, too, famously ignored Chief Justice Roger B. Taney’s order finding unconstitutional Lincoln’s suspension of habeas corpus rights in 1861, early in the Civil War. Thus, court rulings matter only to the extent they are heeded and followed.

[.my2]
但对最高法院最重要的制约在于行政和立法部门对其裁决的执行和落实所施加的影响。这一过程被称为司法执行 。诚然，法院在政策制定中扮演着重要角色，但它们却没有机制将裁决付诸实施。请记住，亚历山大· 汉密尔顿在 《联邦党人文集 》第 78 篇中曾指出，法院“既无强制力，也无意志，而只有判断力”。即便多年以后，当 1832 年最高法院裁定佐治亚州没收美洲原住民土地违宪时，据报道，安德鲁· 杰克逊总统曾说：“约翰· 马歇尔已经做出了决定，现在就让他去执行吧。”而法院的裁决基本上被置之不理。 同样 ，亚伯拉罕 ·林肯也曾无视首席大法官罗杰·B· 托尼关于林肯在 1861 年内战初期暂停人身保护令违宪的命令。因此，法院的裁决只有在被重视和执行时才具有意义。

The Court relies on the executive to implement or enforce its decisions and on the legislative branch to fund them. As the Jackson and Lincoln stories indicate, presidents may simply ignore decisions of the Court, and Congress may withhold funding needed for implementation and enforcement. Fortunately for the courts, these situations rarely happen, and the other branches tend to provide support rather than opposition. In general, presidents have tended to see it as their duty to both obey and enforce Court rulings, and Congress seldom takes away the funding needed for the president to do so.

[.my2]
法院依靠行政部门执行其裁决，也依靠立法部门提供资金。正如杰克逊和林肯的例子所示，总统可能直接无视法院的裁决，国会也可能扣留执行裁决所需的资金。幸运的是，这种情况很少发生，其他部门往往给予支持而非反对。总的来说，总统通常认为遵守和执行法院裁决是他们的职责，而国会也很少削减总统执行裁决所需的资金。

For example, in 1957, President Dwight D. Eisenhower called out the military by executive order to enforce the Supreme Court’s order to racially integrate the public schools in Little Rock, Arkansas. Eisenhower told the nation: “Whenever normal agencies prove inadequate to the task and it becomes necessary for the executive branch of the federal government to use its powers and authority to uphold federal courts, the president’s responsibility is inescapable.”69 Executive Order 10730 nationalized the Arkansas National Guard to enforce desegregation because the governor refused to use the state National Guard troops to protect the Black students trying to enter the school (Figure 13.15).

[.my2]
例如，1957 年，德怀特·D· 艾森豪威尔总统签署行政命令，调动军队执行最高法院关于阿肯色州小石城公立学校种族融合的裁决。艾森豪威尔向全国宣布：“当常规机构无法胜任任务，联邦政府行政部门必须动用其权力和权威来维护联邦法院的裁决时，总统的责任是不可推卸的。” 69 第 10730 号行政命令将阿肯色州国民警卫队收归国有，以强制执行种族融合，因为州长拒绝动用州国民警卫队保护试图进入学校的黑人学生（ 图 13.15 ）。

Figure 13.15 President Eisenhower sent federal troops to escort nine Black students (the “Little Rock Nine”) into an Arkansas high school in 1957 to enforce the Supreme Court’s order outlawing racial segregation in public schools.

图 13.15 1957 年，艾森豪威尔总统派遣联邦军队护送九名黑人学生（“小石城九人”）进入阿肯色州的一所高中，以执行最高法院关于公立学校种族隔离违法的命令。
So what becomes of court decisions is largely due to their credibility, their viability, and the assistance given by the other branches of government. It is also somewhat a matter of tradition and the way the United States has gone about its judicial business for more than two centuries. Although not everyone agrees with the decisions made by the Court, rulings are generally accepted and followed, and the Court is respected as the key interpreter of the laws and the Constitution. Over time, its rulings have become yet another way policy is legitimately made and justice more adequately served in the United States.

[.my2]
因此，法院判决的最终结果很大程度上取决于其公信力、可行性以及其他政府部门的协助。这在某种程度上也与传统以及美国两百多年来的司法运作方式有关。尽管并非所有人都认同法院的判决，但判决通常被接受和执行，法院也因其作为法律和宪法主要解释者的地位而备受尊重。随着时间的推移，法院的判决已成为美国合法制定政策和更充分地伸张正义的又一途径。
