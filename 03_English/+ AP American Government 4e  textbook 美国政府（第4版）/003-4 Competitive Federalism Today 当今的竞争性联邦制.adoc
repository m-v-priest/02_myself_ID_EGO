== 释义



Certain functions clearly belong to the federal government, the state governments, and local governments. National security is a federal matter, the issuance of licenses is a state matter, and garbage collection is a local matter. One aspect of competitive federalism today is that some policy issues, such as immigration and the marital rights of LGBTQ people, have been redefined as the roles that states and the federal government play in them have changed. Another aspect of competitive federalism is that interest groups seeking to change the status quo can take a policy issue up to the federal government or down to the states if they feel it is to their advantage. Interest groups have used this strategy to promote their views on such issues as abortion, gun control, and the legal drinking age.

某些职能显然属于联邦政府、州政府和地方政府的管辖范围。"国家安全"属于联邦事务，许可证发放属于州政府事务，垃圾收集属于地方政府事务。如今"竞争性联邦制"的一个特点是，随着各州和联邦政府在这些议题中扮演的角色发生变化，一些政策议题，例如移民, 和 LGBTQ 人群的婚姻权利，已被重新定义。"竞争性联邦制"的另一个特点是，寻求改变现状的利益集团, 可以根据自身利益，将政策议题提交给联邦政府或州政府。利益集团曾利用这种策略来宣传其在堕胎、枪支管制, 和法定饮酒年龄等问题上的观点。

=== CONTENDING ISSUES

[.my2]
争议问题


Immigration and marriage equality have not been the subject of much contention between states and the federal government until recent decades. Before that, it was understood that the federal government handled immigration and states determined the legality of marriage, whether between people of different races or the same sex. This understanding of exclusive responsibilities has changed; today both levels of government play roles in these two policy areas.

[.my2]
**直到近几十年，移民和婚姻平等问题, 才开始在州政府和联邦政府之间引发激烈争论。在此之前，人们普遍认为联邦政府负责"移民事务"，而各州则负责决定"婚姻的合法性"，无论婚姻是跨种族还是同性。**这种职责划分的观念已经改变；*如今，联邦和州政府都在这两个政策领域发挥作用。*

Immigration federalism describes the gradual movement of states into the immigration policy domain. Since the late 1990s, states have asserted a right to make immigration policy on the grounds that they are enforcing, not supplanting, the nation’s immigration laws, and they are exercising their jurisdictional authority by restricting undocumented immigrants’ access to education, health care, and welfare benefits, areas that fall under the states’ responsibilities. In 2005, twenty-five states had enacted a total of thirty-nine laws related to immigration; by 2014, forty-three states and Washington, DC, had passed a total of 288 immigration-related laws and resolutions. In 2020, thirty-two different states enacted a total of 206 new measures, including many related to COVID-19.

[.my2]
移民联邦制, 描述了各州逐步介入移民政策领域的过程。  **自 20 世纪 90 年代末以来，各州声称有权制定移民政策，理由是它们在"执行"而非"取代"国家移民法，并且它们正在通过限制"无证移民"获得教育、医疗保健和福利等属于州管辖范围的领域, 来行使管辖权。**2005 年，25 个州共颁布了 39 项与移民相关的法律；到 2014 年，43 个州和华盛顿特区, 共通过了 288 项与移民相关的法律和决议。  2020 年，32 个州共颁布了 206 项新措施，其中许多与新冠疫情相关。

Arizona has been one of the states at the forefront of immigration federalism. In 2010, it passed Senate Bill 1070, which sought to make it so difficult for undocumented immigrants to live in the state that they would return to their native country, a strategy referred to as “attrition by enforcement.” The federal government filed suit to block the Arizona law, contending that it conflicted with federal immigration laws. Arizona’s law has also divided society, because some groups have supported its tough stance on immigrants, while other groups have opposed it for humanitarian and human-rights reasons (Figure 3.15). According to a poll of Latino voters in the state by Arizona State University researchers, 81 percent opposed this bill.

[.my2]
**亚利桑那州一直是"移民联邦主义"的先锋州之一。2010 年，该州通过了参议院第 1070 号法案 ，旨在通过严苛的移民政策, 迫使"无证移民"返回原籍国，**这一策略被称为“执法消耗”。  **联邦政府提起诉讼，试图阻止亚利桑那州的这项法律生效，理由是该法律与"联邦移民法"相冲突。**亚利桑那州的这项法律, 也引发了社会分裂，一些团体支持其对移民的强硬立场，而另一些团体则出于人道主义和人权原因, 反对该法律（ 图 3.15 ）。亚利桑那州立大学的研究人员, 对该州拉丁裔选民进行的一项民意调查显示，81%的受访者反对这项法案。


In 2012, in Arizona v. United States, the Supreme Court affirmed federal supremacy on immigration. The court struck down three of the four central provisions of the Arizona law—namely, those allowing police officers to arrest an undocumented immigrant without a warrant if they had probable cause to think the immigrant had committed a crime that could lead to deportation, making it a crime to seek a job without proper immigration documentation, and making it a crime to be in Arizona without valid immigration papers. The court upheld the “show me your papers” provision, which authorizes police officers to check the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest who they suspect is an undocumented immigrant. However, in letting this provision stand, the court warned Arizona and other states with similar laws that they could face civil rights lawsuits if police officers applied it based on racial profiling. All in all, Justice Anthony Kennedy’s opinion embraced an expansive view of the U.S. government’s authority to regulate immigration, describing it as broad and undoubted. That authority derived from the legislative power of Congress to “establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization,” enumerated in the Constitution. During the COVID-19 pandemic, California moved in the opposite direction. The California Immigrant Resilience Fund led to the provision of $75 million for undocumented Californians not eligible for other COVID-19 programs.

[.my2]
2012 年，*在 “亚利桑那州诉美国案” 中，最高法院确认了"联邦政府在移民问题上的至高权力"。*  法院推翻了亚利桑那法律 四项核心条款中的三项——即允许警察在有合理理由怀疑"无证移民"犯有可能导致被驱逐出境的罪行时，无需逮捕令, 即可逮捕该移民；将无"合法移民证件"的求职, 定为犯罪；以及将无"合法移民证件"而滞留在亚利桑那州, 定为犯罪。**法院维持了“出示证件”条款，该条款授权警察检查任何被他们拦截或逮捕的、怀疑是"无证移民"的人的移民身份。  然而，在维持该条款效力的同时，**法院警告亚利桑那州, 和其他拥有类似法律的州，**如果警察基于种族歧视, 而适用该条款，则可能面临"民权诉讼"。 ** 总而言之，安东尼· 肯尼迪大法官的意见, 对美国政府监管移民的权力, 持宽泛的看法，称其权力广泛且毋庸置疑。这项权力源于国会赋予的立法权，即“制定统一的入籍规则 ”，该权力已在宪法中列明。然而，在新冠疫情期间，加利福尼亚州却采取了截然相反的做法。加州移民复原基金, 为不符合其他新冠疫情援助项目资格的无证加州居民, 提供了 7500 万美元的援助。

亚利桑那州参议院第 1070 号法案, 引发了激烈的辩论。请阅读支持者和反对者的观点 。

LGBTQ marital rights have also significantly changed in recent years. By passing the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 1996, the federal government stepped into this policy issue. Not only did DOMA allow states to choose whether to recognize same-sex marriages, it also defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman, which meant that same-sex couples were denied various federal provisions and benefits—such as the right to file joint tax returns and receive Social Security survivor benefits. In 1997, more than half the states in the union had passed some form of legislation banning same-sex marriage. By 2006, two years after Massachusetts became the first state to recognize marriage equality, twenty-seven states had passed constitutional bans on same-sex marriage. In United States v. Windsor, the Supreme Court changed the dynamic established by DOMA by ruling that the federal government had no authority to define marriage. The Court held that states possess the “historic and essential authority to define the marital relation,” and that the federal government’s involvement in this area “departs from this history and tradition of reliance on state law to define marriage.”

[.my2]
近年来，LGBTQ 群体的婚姻权利, 也发生了显著变化。1996 年，联邦政府通过 《婚姻保护法案 》（DOMA），介入了这一政策问题。DOMA 不仅允许各州自行决定是否承认同性婚姻，还将婚姻定义为一男一女的结合，这意味着同性伴侣, 被剥夺了多项联邦条款和福利，例如"联合报税"和"领取社会保障遗属抚恤金"的权利。1997 年，超过半数的州, 通过了某种形式的立法, 禁止同性婚姻。到 2006 年，也就是马萨诸塞州成为第一个承认婚姻平等的州两年后，已有 27 个州通过了宪法修正案, 禁止同性婚姻。在 “美国诉温莎案” 中，**最高法院裁定, 联邦政府无权定义婚姻，**从而改变了 DOMA 所造成的局面。法院认为，各州拥有“定义婚姻关系的历史性和根本性权力”，联邦政府介入这一领域, “背离了依赖州法律定义婚姻的历史和传统” 。

Edith Windsor: Icon of the Marriage Equality Movement

[.my2]
伊迪丝·温莎：婚姻平权运动的标志性人物


Edith Windsor, the plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case United States v. Windsor, became an icon of the marriage equality movement for her successful effort to force repeal the DOMA provision that denied married same-sex couples a host of federal provisions and protections. In 2007, after having lived together since the late 1960s, Windsor and her partner Thea Spyer were married in Canada, where same-sex marriage was legal. After Spyer died in 2009, Windsor received a $363,053 federal tax bill on the estate Spyer had left her. Because her marriage was not valid under federal law, her request for the estate-tax exemption that applies to surviving spouses was denied. With the counsel of her lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, Windsor sued the federal government and won (Figure 3.16).

[.my2]
伊迪丝· 温莎 （Edith Windsor）是美国最高法院里程碑式案件“美国诉温莎案 ”（United States v. Windsor） 的原告，她因成功迫使废除《婚姻保护法案》（DOMA）中剥夺"已婚同性伴侣"诸多联邦权利和保护的条款, 而成为"婚姻平权运动"的标志性人物。2007 年，温莎和她的伴侣西娅 ·斯派尔 （Thea Spyer）在加拿大结婚，此前她们已于 20 世纪 60 年代末开始共同生活。**加拿大"同性婚姻"合法。**2009 年斯派尔去世后，温莎收到了一张 363,053 美元的联邦税单，该税单是针对"斯派尔留给她的遗产"征收的。由于她的婚姻在联邦法律下无效，她申请的适用于遗孀的"遗产税豁免"被驳回。在她的律师罗伯塔·卡普兰（Roberta Kaplan）的帮助下，温莎起诉了联邦政府, 并胜诉（ 图 3.16 ）。



Because of the Windsor decision, federal laws could no longer discriminate against same-sex married couples. What is more, marriage equality became a reality in a growing number of states as federal court after federal court overturned state constitutional bans on same-sex marriage. The Windsor case gave federal judges the moment of clarity from the U.S. Supreme Court that they needed. James Esseks, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s (ACLU) Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender & AIDS Project, summarizes the significance of the case as follows: “Part of what’s gotten us to this exciting moment in American culture is not just Edie’s lawsuit but the story of her life. The love at the core of that story, as well as the injustice at its end, is part of what has moved America on this issue so profoundly.” In the final analysis, same-sex marriage is a protected constitutional right as decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, which took up the issue again when it heard Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015.

[.my2]
由于温莎案的判决，联邦法律不再能够歧视"同性婚姻伴侣"。更重要的是，随着**联邦法院接连推翻各州宪法中对同性婚姻的禁令，**婚姻平等在越来越多的州成为现实。 "温莎案"为联邦法官们提供了他们亟需的来自美国最高法院的明确指示。 美国公民自由联盟 （ACLU）女同性恋、男同性恋、双性恋、跨性别者和艾滋病项目主任詹姆斯·埃塞克斯（James Esseks）, 总结了此案的意义：“美国文化之所以能走到今天这一激动人心的时刻，部分原因不仅在于艾迪的诉讼，更在于她的人生故事。故事核心的爱，以及最终的不公，正是深深触动美国社会，促使人们在这个问题上做出如此深刻的反思。”  归根结底，同性婚姻是一项受宪法保护的权利，正如美国最高法院所裁定的那样。最高法院在 2015 年审理奥贝格费尔诉霍奇斯案时, 再次审议了这个问题。

What role do you feel the story of Edith Windsor played in reframing the debate over same-sex marriage? How do you think it changed the federal government’s view of its role in legislation regarding same-sex marriage relative to the role of the states?

[.my2]
您认为伊迪丝·温莎的故事, 在重塑关于同性婚姻的辩论中, 发挥了怎样的作用？您认为它如何改变了联邦政府对自身在同性婚姻立法中的角色（相对于各州的角色）的看法？

Following the Windsor decision, the number of states that recognized same-sex marriages increased rapidly, as illustrated in Figure 3.17. In 2015, marriage equality was recognized in thirty-six states plus Washington, DC, up from seventeen in 2013. The diffusion of marriage equality across states was driven in large part by federal district and appeals courts, which have used the rationale underpinning the Windsor case (i.e., laws cannot discriminate between same-sex and different-sex couples based on the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment) to invalidate state bans on same-sex marriage. The 2014 court decision not to hear a collection of cases from four different states essentially affirmed same-sex marriage in thirty states. And in 2015 the Supreme Court gave same-sex marriage a constitutional basis of right nationwide in Obergefell v. Hodges. In sum, as the immigration and marriage equality examples illustrate, constitutional disputes have arisen as states and the federal government have sought to reposition themselves on certain policy issues, disputes that the federal courts have had to sort out.

[.my2]
**温莎案判决后，承认同性婚姻的州数量迅速增加，**如图 3.17 所示。2015 年，包括华盛顿特区在内的 36 个州, 承认了婚姻平等，而 2013 年这一数字仅为 17 个州。婚姻平等在各州的普及, 很大程度上得益于联邦地区法院和上诉法院，它们援引温莎案的判决理由（即，根据第十四修正案的平等保护条款，法律不得歧视同性伴侣和异性伴侣）来推翻各州对同性婚姻的禁令。2014 年，法院决定不审理来自四个不同州的一系列案件，这实际上确认了 30 个州的同性婚姻合法化。2015 年，最高法院在"奥贝格费尔诉霍奇斯案"中，赋予了同性婚姻在全国范围内的宪法权利基础。总之，正如移民和婚姻平等的例子所表明的那样，当各州和联邦政府试图在某些政策问题上重新定位自己时，就会出现宪法争议，而联邦法院不得不解决这些争议。

=== STRATEGIZING ABOUT NEW ISSUES

[.my2]
针对新问题制定策略

Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) was established in 1980 by a woman whose thirteen-year-old daughter had been killed by a drunk driver. The organization lobbied state legislators to raise the drinking age and impose tougher penalties, but without success. States with lower drinking ages had an economic interest in maintaining them because they lured youths from neighboring states with restricted consumption laws. So MADD decided to redirect its lobbying efforts at Congress, hoping to find sympathetic representatives willing to take action. In 1984, the federal government passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act (NMDAA), a crosscutting mandate that gradually reduced federal highway grant money to any state that failed to increase the legal age for alcohol purchase and possession to twenty-one. After losing a legal battle against the NMDAA, all states were in compliance by 1988.


[.my2]
“反对酒后驾车母亲协会 ”（MADD）由一位母亲于 1980 年创立，她的 13 岁女儿被一名酒驾司机撞死。该组织游说各州立法者, 提高饮酒年龄, 并加重处罚，但均未成功。**饮酒年龄较低的州, 出于经济利益考虑，倾向于维持较低的饮酒年龄，因为这会吸引邻近州（这些州对饮酒有严格的限制）的青少年前来消费。**因此，**MADD 决定将游说重点转向国会，希望找到愿意采取行动的同情他们的议员。**1984 年，联邦政府通过了《 国家最低饮酒年龄法案》 （NMDAA），这是一项具有全面性的强制性规定，逐步减少任何未能"将购买和持有酒精饮料的法定年龄, 提高到 21 岁"的州的"联邦公路拨款"。在与 NMDAA 的法律诉讼失败后，所有州在 1988 年都遵守了该法案。

By creating two institutional access points—the federal and state governments—the U.S. federal system enables interest groups such as MADD to strategize about how best to achieve their policy objectives. The term venue shopping refers to a strategy in which interest groups select the level and branch of government (legislature, judiciary, or executive) they calculate will be most advantageous for them. If one institutional venue proves unreceptive to an advocacy group’s policy goal, as state legislators were to MADD, the group will attempt to steer its issue to a more responsive venue.

[.my2]
美国联邦体制, 通过设立联邦政府和州政府这两个机构入口，使像 MADD 这样的利益集团能够制定策略，以最佳方式实现其政策目标。所谓“ 选择诉求渠道”， 指的是利益集团选择他们认为最有利于自身的政府层级和部门（立法、司法或行政部门）的一种策略。  *如果某个机构渠道, 对倡导团体的政策目标不予回应，例如州议员对 MADD 的态度，该团体就会尝试将议题转移到更愿意回应的渠道。*

The strategy anti-abortion advocates have used in recent years is another example of venue shopping. In their attempts to limit abortion rights in the wake of the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision making abortion legal nationwide, anti-abortion advocates initially targeted Congress in hopes of obtaining restrictive legislation. Lack of progress at the national level prompted them to shift their focus to state legislators, where their advocacy efforts have been more successful. By 2015, for example, thirty-eight states required some form of parental involvement in a minor’s decision to have an abortion, forty-six states allowed individual health-care providers to refuse to participate in abortions, and thirty-two states prohibited the use of public funds to carry out an abortion except when the pregnant person’s life is in danger or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. The 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, in which the Supreme Court ruled that abortion is not a right, did not stop venue shopping regarding abortion. For example, anti-abortion groups sought a ban on abortion medications by selecting a district that they (correctly) believed would rule in their favor. The court's action prompted a U.S. Representative to introduce legislation limiting the practice of venue shopping at the federal level. (Several states have passed or considered similar legislation.)

[.my2]
近年来，反堕胎倡导者所采用的策略, 是“选择诉讼地点”的又一例证。1973 年，最高法院在 “罗诉韦德案” 中裁定堕胎在全美合法化，此后， **反堕胎倡导者试图"限制堕胎权"，最初的目标是国会，希望通过立法限制堕胎。 由于在国家层面进展缓慢，他们转而将目标转向州议员，并在州议员层面取得了更大的成功。**例如，到 2015 年，已有 38 个州要求, 未成年人堕胎的决定必须有父母参与，46 个州允许个别医疗机构拒绝参与堕胎手术，32 个州禁止使用公共资金进行堕胎，除非孕妇生命受到威胁, 或怀孕是强奸或乱伦的结果。2022 年，最高法院在 “多布斯诉杰克逊妇女健康组织案”中裁定, 堕胎并非一项权利，但这并未阻止反堕胎倡导者在堕胎问题上“选择诉讼地点”的做法。例如，**反堕胎团体为了寻求禁止堕胎药物，选择了他们（正确地）认为会做出有利于他们的判决的地区法院。法院的这一举动, 促使一位美国众议员提出立法，限制联邦层面的“选择审判地”做法。**（一些州已经通过或正在考虑类似的立法。）
