== 释义


What does the word “bureaucracy” conjure in your mind? For many, it evokes inefficiency, corruption, red tape, and government overreach (Figure 15.1). For others, it triggers very different images—of professionalism, helpful and responsive service, and government management. Your experience with bureaucrats and the administration of government probably informs your response to the term. The ability of bureaucracy to inspire both revulsion and admiration is one of several features that make it a fascinating object of study.

“官僚机构”这个词会让你联想到什么？对许多人来说，它让人联想到低效、腐败、繁文缛节和政府权力过度扩张（ 图 15.1 ）。而对另一些人来说，它则会引发截然不同的印象——专业精神、高效便捷的服务和良好的政府管理。你与官僚机构以及政府行政部门的接触经历很可能影响你对这个词的感受。官僚机构既能激起人们的反感，又能令人钦佩，这正是它引人入胜的研究对象的原因之一。

More than that, the many arms of the federal bureaucracy, often considered the fourth branch of government, are valuable components of the federal system. Without this administrative structure, staffed by nonelected workers who possess particular expertise to carry out their jobs, government could not function the way citizens need it to. That does not mean, however, that bureaucracies are perfect. For example, after President Donald Trump was inaugurated for a second, non-consecutive term of office in January 2025, he made shrinking and politicizing the bureaucracy a major part of his agenda.

不仅如此，联邦官僚机构的众多分支机构（通常被视为政府的第四分支）也是联邦体制的重要组成部分。如果没有这个由拥有特定专业知识的非民选工作人员组成的行政机构，政府就无法按照公民的需求正常运作。但这并不意味着官僚机构完美无缺。例如，唐纳德·特朗普总统在2025年1月就任第二个非连续任期后，便将精简官僚机构和使其政治化作为其施政纲领的重要组成部分。

What roles do professional government employees carry out? Who are they, and how and why do they acquire their jobs? How do they run the programs of government enacted by elected leaders? Who makes the rules of a bureaucracy? This chapter uncovers the answers to these questions and many more.

Figure 15.1 This 1885 cartoon reflects the disappointment of office seekers who were turned away from bureaucratic positions they believed their political commitments had earned them. It was published just as the U.S. bureaucracy was being transformed from the spoils system to the merit system primarily in use today.
