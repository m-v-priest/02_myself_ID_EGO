== 释义




One of the cornerstones of a vibrant democracy is citizens’ ability to influence government through voting. In order for that influence to be meaningful, citizens must send clear signals to their leaders about what they wish the government to do. It only makes sense, then, that a democracy will benefit if voters have several clearly differentiated options available to them at the polls on Election Day. Having these options means voters can select a candidate who more closely represents their own preferences on the important issues of the day. It also gives individuals who are considering voting a reason to participate. After all, you are more likely to vote if you care about who wins and who loses. The existence of two major parties, especially in our present era of strong parties, leads to sharp distinctions between the candidates and between the party organizations.

[.my2]
充满活力的民主制度的基石之一是公民通过投票影响政府的能力。为了使这种影响切实有效，公民必须向领导人发出明确的信号，表明他们希望政府做什么。因此，如果选民在选举日当天能在投票站拥有几个清晰明确的选项，那么民主制度自然会从中受益。这些选项意味着选民可以选择一位更能代表他们在重要议题上偏好的候选人。这也为那些正在考虑投票的人提供了参与的理由。毕竟，如果你关心谁胜谁负，你就更有可能去投票。尤其是在我们这个政党势力强大的时代，两大政党的存在会导致候选人之间以及政党组织之间出现明显的差异。

Why do we have two parties? The two-party system came into being because the structure of U.S. elections, with one seat tied to a geographic district, tends to lead to dominance by two major political parties. Even when there are other options on the ballot, most voters understand that minor parties have no real chance of winning even a single office. Hence, they vote for candidates of the two major parties in order to support a potential winner. Of the 535 members of the House and Senate, only a handful identify as something other than Republican or Democrat. Third parties have fared no better in presidential elections. No third-party candidate has ever won the presidency. Some historians or political scientists might consider Abraham Lincoln to have been such a candidate, but in 1860, the Republicans were a major party that had subsumed members of earlier parties, such as the Whig Party, and they were the only major party other than the Democratic Party.

为什么会有两党制？ 两党制的形成是因为美国选举的结构——每个席位与一个选区挂钩——往往导致两大政党占据主导地位。即使选票上还有其他选项，大多数选民也明白小党几乎没有机会赢得任何席位。因此，他们投票给两大党的候选人，以支持可能获胜的候选人。在众议院和参议院的 535 名议员中，只有极少数人认同共和党或民主党以外的党派。第三党在总统选举中的表现也好不到哪里去。历史上从未有第三党候选人赢得过总统大选。一些历史学家或政治学家可能会认为亚伯拉罕·林肯算得上是一位第三党候选人，但在 1860 年，共和党是一个主要政党，它吸收了辉格党等早期政党的成员，而且是除民主党之外唯一的主要政党。

ELECTION RULES AND THE TWO-PARTY SYSTEM
选举规则和两党制
A number of reasons have been suggested to explain why the structure of U.S. elections has resulted in a two-party system. Most of the blame has been placed on the process used to select its representatives. First, most elections at the state and national levels are winner-take-all: The candidate who receives the greatest overall number of votes wins. Winner-take-all elections with one representative elected for one geographic district allow voters to develop a personal relationship with “their” representative to the government. They know exactly whom to blame, or thank, for the actions of that government. But these elections also tend to limit the number of people who run for office. Otherwise-qualified candidates might not stand for election if they feel the incumbent or another candidate has an early advantage in the race. And since voters do not like to waste votes, third parties must convince voters they have a real chance of winning races before voters will take them seriously. This is a tall order given the vast resources and mobilization tools available to the existing parties, especially if an incumbent is one of the competitors. In turn, the likelihood that third-party challengers will lose an election bid makes it more difficult to raise funds to support later attempts.16
人们提出了许多解释，试图说明为什么美国的选举结构最终导致了两党制。其中，大部分责任都归咎于代表的选举过程。首先，大多数州级和国家级选举都采用赢者通吃的制度：得票最多的候选人获胜。这种赢者通吃的选举方式，每个选区只选出一名代表，使得选民能够与“自己”的政府代表建立起个人联系。他们清楚地知道该对政府的哪些行为负责，该感谢谁，该责怪谁。但这种选举方式也往往会限制参选人数。一些原本合格的候选人，如果觉得现任议员或其他候选人在竞选初期占据优势，可能就不会参选。而且，由于选民不愿浪费选票，第三方政党必须让选民相信他们有真正的胜算，才能获得选民的重视。考虑到现有政党拥有的庞大资源和动员工具，这无疑是一项艰巨的任务，尤其是在现任议员也是竞争对手的情况下。反过来，第三方挑战者竞选失败的可能性越大，筹集资金支持后续竞选就越困难 。16

Winner-take-all systems of electing candidates to office, which exist in several countries other than the United States, require that the winner receive either the majority of votes or a plurality of the votes. U.S. elections are based on plurality voting. Plurality voting, commonly referred to as first-past-the-post, is based on the principle that the individual candidate with the most votes wins, whether or not they gain a majority (51 percent or greater) of the total votes cast. For instance, Abraham Lincoln won the presidency in 1860 even though he clearly lacked majority support given the number of candidates in the race. In 1860, four candidates competed for the presidency: Lincoln, a Republican; two Democrats, one from the northern wing of the party and one from the southern wing; and a member of the newly formed Constitutional Union Party, a southern party that wished to prevent the nation from dividing over the issue of slavery. Votes were split among all four parties, and Lincoln became president with only 40 percent of the vote, not a majority of votes cast but more than any of the other three candidates had received, and enough to give him a majority in the Electoral College, the body that ultimately decides presidential elections. Plurality voting has been justified as the simplest and most cost-effective method for identifying a victor in a democracy. A single election can be held on a single day, and the victor of the competition is easily selected. On the other hand, systems in which people vote for a single candidate in an individual district often cost more money because drawing district lines and registering voters according to district is often expensive and cumbersome.17
除美国以外，其他一些国家采用赢者通吃的选举制度，即候选人必须获得多数选票或相对多数选票才能当选。而美国选举采用的是相对多数制 。相对多数制，通常被称为 “简单多数制” ，其原则是得票最多的候选人当选，无论其是否获得过半数（51%或以上）的选票。例如，亚伯拉罕 ·林肯在 1860 年当选总统，尽管考虑到当时的候选人数量，他显然没有获得多数支持。1860 年，共有四位候选人角逐总统宝座：共和党人林肯；两位民主党人，一位来自该党的北方派，一位来自南方派；以及一位来自新成立的宪法联盟党的成员，该党是一个南方政党，旨在防止国家因奴隶制问题而分裂。选票分散在四个政党之间，林肯最终以 40%的得票率当选总统。虽然他并未获得过半数选票，但比其他三位候选人的得票率都高，足以让他赢得选举人团的多数票。选举人团是最终决定总统选举结果的机构。多数制投票被认为是民主制度下确定胜者的最简单、最经济的方法。只需一天即可完成一次选举，胜者便可轻松选出。另一方面，在选区内只投票给一位候选人的制度往往成本更高，因为划分选区和按选区登记选民通常既费钱又费力。17

In a system in which individual candidates compete for individual seats representing unique geographic districts, a candidate must receive a fairly large number of votes in order to win. A political party that appeals to only a small percentage of voters will always lose to a party that is more popular.18 Because second-place (or lower) finishers will receive no reward for their efforts, those parties that do not attract enough supporters to finish first at least some of the time will eventually disappear because their supporters realize they have no hope of achieving success at the polls.19 The failure of third parties to win and the possibility that they will draw votes away from the party the voter had favored before—resulting in a win for the party the voter liked least—makes people hesitant to vote for the third party’s candidates a second time. This has been the fate of all U.S. third parties—the Populist Party, the Progressives, the Dixiecrats, the Reform Party, and others.

[.my2]
在候选人各自竞选代表不同地理选区的席位的制度下，候选人必须获得相当多的选票才能获胜。一个只吸引一小部分选民的政党总是会输给更受欢迎的政党。 18 由于排名第二（或更低）的候选人无法获得任何回报，那些无法吸引足够支持者至少在某些时候获得第一名的政党最终会消失，因为他们的支持者意识到他们没有希望在选举中获胜。 19 第三党未能获胜，以及它们可能会从选民之前支持的政党那里分走选票——最终导致选民最不喜欢的政党获胜——使得人们不愿再次投票给第三党的候选人。这正是美国所有第三党——民粹党、进步党、南方民主党、改革党等等——的命运。

In a proportional electoral system, however, parties advertise who is on their candidate list and voters pick a party. Then, legislative seats are doled out to the parties based on the proportion of support each party receives. While the Green Party in the United States might not win a single congressional seat in some years thanks to plurality voting, in a proportional system, it stands a chance to get a few seats in the legislature regardless. For example, assume the Green Party gets 7 percent of the vote. In the United States, 7 percent will never be enough to win a single seat, shutting the Green candidates out of Congress entirely, whereas in a proportional system, the Green Party will get 7 percent of the total number of legislative seats available. Hence, it could get a foothold for its issues and perhaps increase its support over time. But with plurality voting, it doesn’t stand a chance.

[.my2]
然而，在比例代表制选举制度下，各政党会公布其候选人名单，选民则选择支持哪个政党。然后，立法机构的席位会根据各政党获得的支持比例分配给相应的政党。在美国，由于多数制投票制度， 绿党有时可能一个国会席位都赢不了；但在比例代表制下，绿党无论如何都有机会在立法机构中获得几个席位。例如，假设绿党获得 7%的选票。在美国，7%的得票率永远不足以赢得一个席位，绿党候选人将彻底无缘国会；但在比例代表制下，绿党将获得 7%的立法机构席位。因此，绿党有机会为其议题争取支持，并可能随着时间的推移增加其支持率。但在多数制投票制度下，绿党毫无胜算。

Third parties, often born of frustration with the current system, attract supporters from one or both of the existing parties during an election but fail to attract enough votes to win. After the election is over, supporters experience remorse when their least-favorite candidate wins instead. For example, in the 2000 election, Ralph Nader ran for president as the candidate of the Green Party. Nader, a longtime consumer activist concerned with environmental issues and social justice, attracted many votes from people who usually voted for Democratic candidates. This has caused some to claim that Democratic nominee Al Gore lost the 2000 election to Republican George W. Bush, because Nader won Democratic votes in Florida that might otherwise have gone to Gore (Figure 9.5).20
第三党派往往源于对现有体制的不满，它们在选举期间会吸引现有两党中一个或两个政党的支持者，但最终却无法获得足够的选票赢得选举。选举结束后，当这些支持者发现自己最不喜欢的候选人反而获胜时，他们会感到懊悔。例如，在 2000 年的总统大选中，拉尔夫· 纳德作为绿党候选人参选。纳德是一位长期关注环境问题和社会正义的消费者权益活动家，他吸引了许多通常投票给民主党候选人的选民。这导致一些人声称，民主党候选人阿尔·戈尔之所以在 2000 年大选中败给共和党候选人乔治·W·布什，是因为纳德在佛罗里达州赢得了原本可能投给戈尔的民主党选票（ 图 9.5 ）。 20

However, in 2000, he ran for the presidency as the Green Party candidate.

Abandoning plurality voting, even if the winner-take-all election were kept, would almost certainly increase the number of parties from which voters could choose. The easiest switch would be to a majoritarian voting scheme, in which a candidate wins only if they enjoy the support of a majority of voters. If no candidate wins a majority in the first round of voting, a run-off election is held among the top contenders. Some states conduct their primary elections within the two major political parties in this way.

[.my2]
即使保留赢者通吃的选举制度，放弃简单多数制也几乎肯定会增加选民可选择的政党数量。最简便的改革是采用多数制投票机制，即候选人只有获得多数选民的支持才能当选。如果在第一轮投票中没有候选人获得多数票，则在得票最高的候选人之间举行决选。一些州在两大政党内部就采用这种方式进行初选。

A second way to increase the number of parties in the U.S. system is to abandon the winner-take-all approach. Rather than allowing voters to pick their representatives directly, many democracies have chosen to have voters pick their preferred party and allow the party to select the individuals who serve in government. The argument for this method is that it is ultimately the party and not the individual who will influence policy. Under this model of proportional representation, legislative seats are allocated to competing parties based on the total share of votes they receive in the election. As a result, any given election can have multiple winners, and voters who might prefer a smaller party over a major one have a chance to be represented in government (Figure 9.6).

[.my2]
增加美国政党数量的第二种方法是放弃赢者通吃的模式。许多民主国家不再允许选民直接选举代表，而是选择让选民选择自己支持的政党，再由该政党挑选政府官员。这种方法的论点是，最终影响政策的是政党而非个人。在这种比例代表制模式下，立法席位根据各政党在选举中获得的选票总数进行分配。因此，任何一次选举都可能出现多个获胜者，而那些可能更倾向于小党而非大党的选民也有机会在政府中获得代表（ 图 9.6 ）。

One possible way to implement proportional representation in the United States is to allocate legislative seats based on the national level of support for each party’s presidential candidate, rather than on the results of individual races. If this method had been used in the 1996 elections, 8 percent of the seats in Congress would have gone to Ross Perot’s Reform Party because he won 8 percent of the votes cast. Even though Perot himself lost, his supporters would have been rewarded for their efforts with representatives who had a real voice in government. And Perot’s party’s chances of survival would have greatly increased.

[.my2]
在美国实施比例代表制的一种可能方法是，根据各党总统候选人在全国范围内的支持率，而不是根据个别选举的结果来分配立法席位。如果1996年大选采用这种方法，罗斯·佩罗领导的改革党将获得国会8%的席位，因为他赢得了8%的选票。尽管佩罗本人落败，但他的支持者将因其努力而获得回报，拥有真正能在政府中拥有话语权的代表。而佩罗的政党生存的几率也将大大提高。

Electoral rules are probably not the only reason the United States has a two-party system. We need only look at the number of parties in the British or Canadian systems, both of which are winner-take-all plurality systems like that in the United States, to see that it is possible to have more than two parties while still directly electing representatives. The two-party system is also rooted in U.S. history. The first parties, the Federalists and the Jeffersonian Republicans, disagreed about how much power should be given to the federal government, and differences over other important issues further strengthened this divide. Over time, these parties evolved into others by inheriting, for the most part, the general ideological positions and constituents of their predecessors, but no more than two major parties ever formed. Instead of parties arising based on region or ethnicity, various regions and ethnic groups sought a place in one of the two major parties.

[.my2]
选举规则或许并非美国实行两党制的唯一原因。我们只需看看英国或加拿大的政党数量，这两个国家都和美国一样采用赢者通吃的多数制，就能明白在直接选举代表的情况下，存在两个以上的政党也是可能的。两党制也根植于美国历史。最早的两党——联邦党人和杰斐逊共和党人——在联邦政府的权力分配问题上存在分歧，而其他重要议题上的分歧进一步加剧了这种分裂。随着时间的推移，这些政党大多继承了前人的意识形态立场和选民基础，并演变成其他政党，但始终没有形成超过两大政党。政党的形成并非基于地域或族裔，而是各个地区和族裔群体寻求加入两大政党之一。

Scholars of voting behavior have also suggested at least three other characteristics of the U.S. system that are likely to influence party outcomes: the Electoral College, demobilized ethnicity, and campaign and election laws. First, the United States has a presidential system in which the winner is selected not directly by the popular vote but indirectly by a group of electors known collectively as the Electoral College. The winner-take-all system also applies in the Electoral College. In all but two states (Maine and Nebraska), the total of the state’s electoral votes go to the candidate who wins the plurality of the popular vote in that state. Even if a new, third party is able to win the support of a lot of voters, it must be able to do so in several states in order to win enough electoral votes to have a chance of winning the presidency.21
研究投票行为的学者还指出，美国政治制度至少还有三个其他特征可能影响政党选举结果： 选举人团制度 、族裔政治动员程度降低以及竞选和选举法。首先，美国的总统制并非由普选直接产生，而是由一群被称为选举人团的选举人间接选出。选举人团也实行赢者通吃的制度。除缅因州和内布拉斯加州外，该州所有选举人票都投给在该州获得普选票最多的候选人。即使一个新成立的第三党能够赢得大量选民的支持，也必须在多个州获得支持，才能赢得足够的选举人票，从而有机会赢得总统职位。 21

Besides the existence of the Electoral College, political scientist Gary W. Cox has also suggested that the relative prosperity of the United States and the relative unity of its citizens have prevented the formation of “large dissenting groups” that might give support to third parties.22 This is similar to the argument that the United States does not have viable third parties, because none of its regions is dominated by mobilized ethnic minorities that have created political parties in order to defend and to address concerns solely of interest to that ethnic group. Such parties are common in other countries.

[.my2]
除了选举人团制度的存在，政治学家加里·W· 考克斯还指出，美国的相对繁荣和公民的相对团结阻碍了可能支持第三党的“大型异议群体”的形成。 22 这与美国不存在真正意义上的第三党的论点类似，因为美国没有任何一个地区是由动员起来的少数族裔主导，这些少数族裔为了维护和解决自身族群的利益而组建政党。而这类政党在其他国家很常见。

Finally, party success is strongly influenced by local election laws. Someone has to write the rules that govern elections, and those rules help to determine outcomes. In the United States, such rules have been written to make it easy for existing parties to secure a spot for their candidates in future elections. But some states create significant burdens for candidates who wish to run as independents or who choose to represent new parties. For example, one common practice is to require a candidate who does not have the support of a major party to ask registered voters to sign a petition. Sometimes, thousands of signatures are required before a candidate’s name can be placed on the ballot (Figure 9.7), but a small third party that does have large numbers of supporters in some states may not be able to secure enough signatures for this to happen.23
最后，政党的成功很大程度上受到地方选举法的影响。选举规则需要有人制定，而这些规则又会影响选举结果。在美国，这些规则的制定旨在方便现有政党在未来的选举中为其候选人争取席位。但一些州对希望以独立候选人身份参选或选择代表新政党的候选人设置了诸多障碍。例如，一种常见的做法是要求未获得主要政党支持的候选人必须征求已登记选民的签名。有时，候选人需要获得数千个签名才能被列入选票（ 图 9.7 ），但一些州的小型第三党即使拥有大量支持者，也可能无法获得足够的签名。 23

Given the obstacles to the formation of third parties, it is unlikely that serious challenges to the U.S. two-party system will emerge. But this does not mean that we should view it as entirely stable either. The U.S. party system is technically a loose organization of fifty different state parties and has undergone several considerable changes since its initial consolidation after the Civil War. Third-party movements may have played a role in some of these changes, but all resulted in a shifting of party loyalties among the U.S. electorate.

[.my2]
鉴于组建第三党面临重重阻碍，美国两党制不太可能出现重大挑战。但这并不意味着我们应该认为它完全稳定。从技术层面讲，美国的政党体系是由五十个不同的州级政党组成的松散组织，自内战后最初巩固以来，经历了数次重大变革。第三党运动或许在某些变革中发挥了作用，但所有这些变革都导致了美国选民政党忠诚度的转移。

CRITICAL ELECTIONS AND REALIGNMENT
关键选举与权力重组
Political parties exist for the purpose of winning elections in order to influence public policy. This requires them to build coalitions across a wide range of voters who share similar preferences. Since most U.S. voters identify as moderates,24 the historical tendency has been for the two parties to compete for “the middle” while also trying to mobilize their more loyal bases. If voters’ preferences remained stable for long periods of time, and if both parties did a good job of competing for their votes, we could expect Republicans and Democrats to be reasonably competitive in any given election. Election outcomes would probably be based on the way voters compared the parties on the most important events of the day rather than on electoral strategy.

[.my2]
政党存在的目的是赢得选举，从而影响公共政策。这就要求它们在具有相似偏好的广大选民中建立联盟。由于大多数美国选民都认同温和派立场， 因此历史上两党往往在争夺“中间选民”的同时，也努力动员各自的忠实支持者。如果选民的偏好长期保持稳定，并且两党都能有效地争取选票，那么我们可以预期共和党和民主党在任何一次选举中都会势均力敌。选举结果可能更多地取决于选民如何比较两党在当天最重要事件上的表现，而不是取决于选举策略。

There are many reasons we would be wrong in these expectations, however. First, the electorate isn’t entirely stable. Each generation of voters has been a bit different from the last. Over time, the United States has become more socially liberal, especially on topics related to race and gender, and Millennials—those born between 1981 and 1996 are more liberal than members of older generations.25 The electorate’s economic preferences have changed, and different social groups are likely to become more engaged in politics now than they did in the past. Surveys conducted in 2016, for example, revealed that candidates’ religion is less important to voters than it once was. Also, as young Latinos reach voting age, they seem more inclined to vote than do their parents, which may raise the traditionally low voting rates among this ethnic group.26 Internal population shifts and displacements have also occurred, as various regions have taken their turn experiencing economic growth or stagnation, and as new waves of immigrants have come to U.S. shores.

[.my2]
然而，我们有很多理由认为这些预期是错误的。首先，选民群体并非完全稳定。每一代选民都与上一代略有不同。随着时间的推移，美国的社会风气变得更加自由化，尤其是在种族和性别议题上，而千禧一代（1981 年至 1996 年出生）比老一代人更加自由。 25 选民的经济偏好也发生了变化，不同的社会群体现在比过去更可能积极参与政治。例如，2016 年的调查显示，候选人的宗教信仰对选民的重要性不如以往。此外，随着年轻的拉丁裔选民达到投票年龄，他们似乎比他们的父母更倾向于投票，这可能会提高该族裔群体历来较低的投票率。 26 随着各个地区经历经济增长或停滞，以及新一波移民涌入美国，美国国内的人口流动和迁移也随之发生。

Additionally, the major parties have not always been unified in their approach to contesting elections. While we think of both Congress and the presidency as national offices, the reality is that congressional elections are sometimes more like local elections. Voters may reflect on their preferences for national policy when deciding whom to send to the Senate or the House of Representatives, but they are very likely to view national policy in the context of its effects on their area, their family, or themselves, not based on what is happening to the country as a whole. For example, while many voters want to reduce the federal budget, those over sixty-five are particularly concerned that no cuts to the Medicare program be made.27 One-third of those polled reported that “senior’s issues” were most important to them when voting for national officeholders.28 If they hope to keep their jobs, elected officials must thus be sensitive to preferences in their home constituencies as well as the preferences of their national party.

[.my2]
此外，各大政党在竞选策略上并非始终保持一致。虽然我们通常将国会和总统视为国家级职位，但实际上，国会选举有时更像是地方选举。选民在决定将谁送入参议院或众议院时，可能会考虑他们对国家政策的偏好，但他们很可能更多地从国家政策对其所在地区、家庭或自身的影响来看待这些政策，而不是从国家整体的走向来评判。例如，虽然许多选民希望削减联邦预算，但 65 岁以上的选民尤其担心医疗保险计划（Medicare）的经费会被削减。27 三分之一的受访者表示，在投票选举国家级官员时，“老年人问题”对他们来说最为重要 。28 因此，如果当选官员希望保住职位，就必须既关注选区选民的偏好，也关注其所在政党的偏好。

Finally, it sometimes happens that over a series of elections, parties may be unable or unwilling to adapt their positions to broader socio-demographic or economic forces. Parties need to be aware when society changes. If leaders refuse to recognize that public opinion has changed, the party is unlikely to win in the next election. For example, people who describe themselves as evangelical Christians are an important Republican constituency; they are also strongly opposed to abortion.29 Thus, even though the majority of U.S. adults believe abortion should be legal in at least some instances, such as when a pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or threatens the life of the mother, the position of many Republican presidential candidates in 2016 was to oppose abortion in all cases.30 As a result, many women view the Republican Party as unsympathetic to their interests and are more likely to support Democratic candidates.31 Similarly (or simultaneously), groups that have felt that the party has served their causes in the past may decide to look elsewhere if they feel their needs are no longer being met. Either way, the party system will be upended as a result of a party realignment, or a shifting of party allegiances within the electorate (Table 9.1).32
最后，有时在多次选举中，政党可能无法或不愿调整其立场以适应更广泛的社会人口或经济力量。政党需要意识到社会的变化。如果领导人拒绝承认公众舆论已经改变，那么该党不太可能在下次选举中获胜。例如，自称福音派基督徒的人是共和党的重要选民群体；他们也强烈反对堕胎。 29 因此，尽管大多数美国成年人认为堕胎至少在某些情况下应该合法，例如怀孕是强奸或乱伦的结果，或危及母亲生命时，但 2016 年许多共和党总统候选人的立场是反对一切情况下的堕胎。 30 结果，许多女性认为共和党不关心她们的利益，更倾向于支持民主党候选人。 31 同样地（或同时），那些过去认为该党为其事业服务的群体，如果感到自身需求不再得到满足，可能会选择寻找其他政党。无论哪种方式，政党体系都将因政党重组或选民内部政党忠诚度的转变而发生颠覆（ 表 9.1 ）。 32

Table 9.1 There have been six distinctive periods in U.S. history when new political parties have emerged, control of the presidency has shifted from one party to another, or significant changes in a party’s makeup have occurred.

表 9.1 美国历史上曾出现过六个不同的时期，在这些时期中，新的政党出现，总统职位从一个政党转移到另一个政党，或者一个政党的组成发生了重大变化。
One of the best-known party realignments occurred when Democrats moved to include African Americans and other minorities into their national coalition during the Great Depression. After the Civil War, Republicans, the party of Lincoln, were viewed as the party that had freed the enslaved. Their efforts to provide Black people with greater legal rights earned them the support of African Americans in both the South, where they were newly enfranchised, and the Northeast. When the Democrats, the party of the Confederacy, lost control of the South after the Civil War, Republicans ruled the region. However, the Democrats regained control of the South after the removal of the Union army in 1877. Democrats had largely supported slavery before the Civil War, and they opposed postwar efforts to integrate African Americans into society after they were liberated. In addition, Democrats in the North and Midwest drew their greatest support from labor union members and immigrants who viewed African Americans as competitors for jobs and government resources, and who thus tended to oppose the extension of rights to African Americans as much as their southern counterparts did.33
最著名的政党重组之一发生在经济大萧条时期，当时民主党开始将非裔美国人和其他少数族裔纳入其全国联盟。 内战结束后，林肯所在的共和党被视为解放奴隶的政党。他们为黑人争取更多法律权利的努力赢得了南方（黑人刚刚获得选举权）和东北部非裔美国人的支持。内战结束后，作为南方邦联政党的民主党失去了对南方的控制权，共和党统治了该地区。然而，1877 年联邦军队撤离后，民主党重新夺回了对南方的控制权。内战前，民主党在很大程度上支持奴隶制，并且在战后反对将获得解放的非裔美国人融入社会的努力。此外，北方和中西部的民主党人主要依靠工会成员和移民的支持，这些人将非裔美国人视为工作和政府资源的竞争对手，因此他们和南方民主党人一样，反对扩大非裔美国人的权利 。33

While the Democrats’ opposition to civil rights may have provided regional advantages in southern or urban elections, it was largely disastrous for national politics. From 1868 to 1931, Democratic candidates won just four of sixteen presidential elections. Two of these victories can be explained as a result of the spoiler effect of the Progressive Party in 1912 and then Woodrow Wilson’s reelection during World War I in 1916. This rather-dismal success rate suggested that a change in the governing coalition would be needed if the party were to have a chance at once again becoming a player on the national level.

尽管民主党反对民权运动可能在南方或城市选举中为其带来地区优势，但对全国政治而言，这却造成了灾难性的后果。从1868年到1931年，民主党候选人在16次总统选举中仅赢得4次。其中两次胜利可归因于1912年进步党的“搅局效应”，以及1916年伍德罗·威尔逊在第一次世界大战期间的连任。如此惨淡的胜率表明，如果民主党想要重回全国政治舞台，就必须改变其执政联盟。

That change began with the 1932 presidential campaign of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. FDR determined that his best path toward victory was to create a new coalition based not on region or ethnicity, but on the suffering of those hurt the most during the Great Depression. This alignment sought to bring African American voters in as a means of shoring up support in major urban areas and the Midwest, where many southern Black people had migrated in the decades after the Civil War in search of jobs and better education for their children, as well as to avoid many of the legal restrictions placed on them in the South. Roosevelt accomplished this realignment by promising assistance to those hurt most by the Depression, including African Americans.

这一转变始于 1932 年富兰克林·德拉诺 ·罗斯福的总统竞选。罗斯福认为，他赢得胜利的最佳途径是建立一个全新的联盟，这个联盟的基石并非地域或种族，而是那些在大萧条中遭受重创的人们。这一联盟旨在争取非裔美国选民的支持，以此巩固其在主要城市地区和中西部地区的影响力。内战结束后几十年间，许多南方黑人为了寻找工作、为子女提供更好的教育，以及规避南方对他们的诸多法律限制，迁徙到了中西部地区。罗斯福承诺向受大萧条影响最严重的人们，包括非裔美国人，提供援助，从而实现了这一联盟的重组。

The strategy worked. Roosevelt won the election with almost 58 percent of the popular vote and 472 Electoral College votes, compared to incumbent Herbert Hoover’s 59. The 1932 election is considered an example of a critical election, one that represents a sudden, clear, and long-term shift in voter allegiances. After this election, the political parties were largely identified as being divided by differences in their members’ socio-economic status. Those who favor stability of the current political and economic system tend to vote Republican, whereas those who would most benefit from changing the system usually favor Democratic candidates. Based on this alignment, the Democratic Party won the next five consecutive presidential elections and was able to build a political machine that dominated Congress into the 1990s, including holding an uninterrupted majority in the House of Representatives from 1954 until 1994.

这一策略奏效了。罗斯福以近 58%的普选票和 472 张选举人票赢得了大选，而时任总统赫伯特·胡佛仅获得 59 张。1932 年的总统选举被认为是一次关键性选举 ，它代表了选民忠诚度的突然、清晰且长期的转变。选举之后，各政党之间的分歧主要体现在其成员的社会经济地位差异上。那些倾向于维持现有政治经济体制稳定的选民往往投票给共和党，而那些最希望体制变革的选民则通常支持民主党候选人。基于这种选民结构，民主党赢得了接下来的五届总统大选，并建立了一个强大的政治机器，在 20 世纪 90 年代之前一直主导着国会，包括从 1954 年到 1994 年在众议院保持不间断的多数席位。

The realignment of the parties did have consequences for Democrats. African Americans became an increasingly important part of the Democratic coalition in the 1940s through the 1960s, as the party took steps to support civil rights.34 Most changes were limited to the state level at first, but as civil rights reform moved to the national stage, rifts between northern and southern Democrats began to emerge.35 Southern Democrats became increasingly convinced that national efforts to provide social welfare and encourage racial integration were violating state sovereignty and social norms. By the 1970s, many had begun to shift their allegiance to the Republican Party, whose pro-business wing shared their opposition to the growing encroachment of the national government into what they viewed as state and local matters.36
政党重组确实对民主党产生了影响。从 20 世纪 40 年代到 60 年代，随着民主党采取措施支持民权运动，非裔美国人在民主党联盟中的地位日益重要。 34 起初，大多数变革仅限于州一级，但随着民权改革上升到国家层面，南北民主党人之间的分歧开始显现。 35 南方民主党人越来越相信，国家层面提供社会福利和促进种族融合的努力侵犯了州主权和社会规范。到了 20 世纪 70 年代，许多人开始转而支持共和党，因为共和党亲商派与他们一样反对联邦政府日益干预他们认为属于州和地方事务的事务。 36

Almost fifty years after it had begun, the realignment of the two political parties resulted in the flipping of post-Civil War allegiances, with urban areas and the Northeast now solidly Democratic, and the South and rural areas overwhelmingly voting Republican. The result today is a political system that provides Republicans with considerable advantages in rural areas and most parts of the Deep South.37 Democrats dominate urban politics and those parts of the South, known as the Black Belt, where the majority of residents are African American.

近五十年后，两党重组导致内战后政治格局发生逆转：城市地区和东北部如今牢牢掌握在民主党手中，而南部和农村地区则绝大多数支持共和党。如今的政治格局使得共和党在农村地区和南部腹地的大部分地区拥有显著优势。 民主党则主导着城市政治以及南部被称为“黑带”的地区，这些地区的大部分居民为非裔美国人。
