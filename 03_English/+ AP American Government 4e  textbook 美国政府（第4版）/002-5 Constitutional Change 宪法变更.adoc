== 释义



A major problem with the Articles of Confederation had been the nation’s inability to change them without the unanimous consent of all the states. The framers learned this lesson well. One of the strengths they built into the Constitution was the ability to amend it to meet the nation’s needs, reflect the changing times, and address concerns or structural elements they had not anticipated.

《邦联条例》 的一个主要问题是，未经所有州一致同意，国家无法对其进行修改。制宪者们吸取了这一教训。他们在宪法中建立的优势之一，就是允许根据国家需要、时代变迁, 以及他们未曾预料到的问题, 或结构性缺陷, 进行修正。

=== THE AMENDMENT PROCESS

[.my2]
修订程序

Since ratification in 1789, the Constitution has been amended only twenty-seven times. The first ten amendments were added in 1791. Responding to charges by Anti-Federalists that the Constitution made the national government too powerful and provided no protections for the rights of individuals, the newly elected federal government tackled the issue of guaranteeing liberties for American citizens. James Madison, a member of Congress from Virginia, took the lead in drafting nineteen potential changes to the Constitution.

[.my2]
自 1789 年批准以来，美国宪法仅被修正过 27 次。前十条修正案于 1791 年通过。当时，"反联邦主义者"指责宪法赋予联邦政府过大的权力，且未能保障个人权利。为了回应这些指责，新当选的联邦政府, 着手解决保障美国公民自由的问题。弗吉尼亚州国会议员詹姆斯 ·麦迪逊牵头起草了 19 项宪法修正案。

Madison followed the procedure outlined in Article V that says amendments can originate from one of two sources. First, they can be proposed by Congress. Then, they must be approved by a two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate before being sent to the states for potential ratification. States have two ways to ratify or defeat a proposed amendment. First, if three-quarters of state legislatures vote to approve an amendment, it becomes part of the Constitution. Second, if three-quarters of state-ratifying conventions support the amendment, it is ratified. A second method of proposal of an amendment allows for the petitioning of Congress by the states: Upon receiving such petitions from two-thirds of the states, Congress must call a convention for the purpose of proposing amendments, which would then be forwarded to the states for ratification by the required three-quarters. All the current constitutional amendments were created using the first method of proposal (via Congress).

[.my2]
麦迪逊遵循了宪法第五条规定的程序，该条规定, **修正案的来源有两种。首先，可以由国会提出。然后，修正案必须经众议院和参议院三分之二多数通过，才能送交各州批准。**各州有两种方式批准或否决一项修正案。第一种方式是，如果四分之三的"州议会"投票通过一项修正案，该修正案就成为宪法的一部分。第二种方式是，如果四分之三的州议会批准该修正案，该修正案即获得批准。第二种提出修正案的方式, 是允许各州向国会请愿：国会收到三分之二州的请愿后，必须召开"制宪会议"，提出修正案，然后将修正案提交各州，由四分之三的州批准。所有现行的"宪法修正案", 都是通过第一种方式（通过国会）制定的。

Having drafted nineteen proposed amendments, Madison submitted them to Congress. Only twelve were approved by two-thirds of both the Senate and the House of Representatives and sent to the states for ratification. Of these, only ten were accepted by three-quarters of the state legislatures. In 1791, these first ten amendments were added to the Constitution and became known as the Bill of Rights.

[.my2]
麦迪逊起草了十九条修正案草案，并提交给国会。其中只有十二条, 获得参众两院三分之二的多数票通过，送交各州批准。*最终，只有十条, 获得四分之三州议会的批准。1791 年，这最初的十条修正案,被加入宪法，成为著名的《 权利法案》 。*

The ability to change the Constitution has made it a flexible, living document that can respond to the nation’s changing needs and has helped it remain in effect for more than 225 years. At the same time, the framers made amending the document sufficiently difficult that it has not been changed repeatedly; only seventeen amendments have been added since the ratification of the first ten (one of these, the Twenty-Seventh Amendment, was among Madison’s rejected nine proposals). Recent conversations about needed amendments have related to women's rights, flag burning, and reforming the Electoral College. To date, none of these has advanced.

[.my2]
宪法的修改能力, 使其成为一份灵活的、与时俱进的文件，能够应对国家不断变化的需求，并使其得以持续生效超过225年。与此同时，宪法的制定者们也设置了足够的障碍，使得宪法并未被频繁修改；自最初十条修正案获得批准以来，仅新增了十七条修正案（其中第二十七条修正案, 曾是麦迪逊提出的九项被否决的提案之一）。近期关于需要修改宪法的讨论, 涉及妇女权利、焚烧国旗, 以及"选举人团制度改革"等议题。迄今为止，这些议题均未取得任何进展。

=== KEY CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES

[.my2]
关键的宪法变革

The Bill of Rights was intended to quiet the fears of Anti-Federalists that the Constitution did not adequately protect individual liberties and thus encourage their support of the new national government. Many of these first ten amendments were based on provisions of the English Bill of Rights and the Virginia Declaration of Rights. For example, the right to bear arms for protection (Second Amendment), the right not to have to provide shelter and provision for soldiers in peacetime (Third Amendment), the right to a trial by jury (Sixth and Seventh Amendments), and protection from excessive fines and from cruel and unusual punishment (Eighth Amendment) are taken from the English Bill of Rights. The Fifth Amendment, which requires among other things that people cannot be deprived of their life, liberty, or property except by a legal proceeding, was also greatly influenced by English law as well as the protections granted to Virginians in the Virginia Declaration of Rights.

[.my2]
《 权利法案》 旨在消除反联邦主义者对"宪法未能充分保护个人自由"的担忧，从而鼓励他们支持新成立的联邦政府。**前十条修正案中的许多条款, 都源自英国《权利法案》 和《 弗吉尼亚权利宣言 》。**例如，为自卫而持有武器的权利（ 第二修正案 ）、和平时期无需为士兵提供住所和给养的权利（ 第三修正案 ）、"由陪审团审判"的权利（第六和第七修正案）, 以及"免受过重罚款和残酷、不寻常惩罚"的权利（ 第八修正案 ）均来自英国《权利法案》。 第五修正案规定，除其他事项外，任何人不得被剥夺生命、自由或财产，除非经过法律程序，这一条款也深受英国法律, 以及《弗吉尼亚权利宣言》赋予弗吉尼亚人的保护条款的影响。

Other liberties, however, do not derive from British precedents. The protections for religion, speech, the press, and assembly that are granted by the First Amendment did not exist under English law. (The right to petition the government did, however.) The prohibition in the First Amendment against the establishment of an official church by the federal government differed significantly from both English precedent and the practice of several states that had official churches. The Fourth Amendment, which protects Americans from unwarranted search and seizure of their property, was also new.
[.my2]

#*然而，其他一些自由并非源自英国先例。 第一修正案赋予的宗教、言论、出版和集会自由的保护，在英国法律中并不存在。（但"向政府请愿的权利"是存在的。）第一修正案"禁止联邦政府设立官方教会"，这与英国先例, 以及一些设有官方教会的州的做法, 都大相径庭。保护美国公民免受无端搜查和扣押财产的第四修正案, 也是一项新规定。*#

The Ninth and Tenth Amendments were intended to provide yet another assurance that people’s rights would be protected and that the federal government would not become too powerful. The Ninth Amendment guarantees that liberties extend beyond those described in the preceding documents. This was an important acknowledgment that the protected rights were extensive, and the government should not attempt to interfere with them. The Supreme Court, for example, has held that the Ninth Amendment protects the right to privacy even though none of the preceding amendments explicitly mentions this right. The Tenth Amendment, one of the first submitted to the states for ratification, ensures that states possess all powers not explicitly assigned to the federal government by the Constitution. This guarantee protects states’ reserved powers to regulate such things as marriage, divorce, and intrastate transportation and commerce, and to pass laws affecting education and public health and safety.


[.my2]
第九修正案和第十修正案, 旨在进一步保障人民的权利受到保护，并确保联邦政府权力不会过大。 第九修正案保障的自由范围, 超越了前述修正案所描述的范围。这重要地承认了受保护权利的广泛性，并表明政府不应干涉这些权利。例如，最高法院裁定，第九修正案保护隐私权，尽管前述修正案均未明确提及此项权利。 第十修正案是最早提交各州批准的修正案之一，它**确保"各州拥有宪法未明确授予联邦政府的所有权力"。**这项保障保护了各州保留的权力，例如监管婚姻、离婚、州内交通和商业，以及制定影响教育、公共卫生和安全的法律。

Of the later amendments only one, the Twenty-First, repealed another amendment, the Eighteenth, which had prohibited the manufacture, import, export, distribution, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages. Other amendments rectify problems that have arisen over the years or that reflect changing times. For example, the Seventeenth Amendment, ratified in 1913, gave voters the right to directly elect U.S. senators. The Twentieth Amendment, which was ratified in 1933 during the Great Depression, moved the date of the presidential inauguration from March to January. In a time of crisis, like a severe economic depression, the president needed to take office almost immediately after being elected, and modern transportation allowed the new president to travel to the nation’s capital quicker than before. The Twenty-Second Amendment, added in 1955, limits the president to two terms in office, and the Twenty-Seventh Amendment, first submitted for ratification in 1789, regulates the implementation of laws regarding salary increases or decreases for members of Congress.

[.my2]
在后来的修正案中，只有第二十一条废除了第十八条修正案。第十八条修正案禁止制造、进口、出口、分销、运输和销售酒精饮料。其他修正案则纠正了多年来出现的问题，或反映了时代变迁。例如，1913 年批准的**第十七条修正案, 赋予选民直接选举美国"参议员"的权利。**1933 年大萧条时期批准的第二十条修正案, 将总统就职典礼的日期, 从 3 月提前到 1 月。在危机时期，例如严重的经济萧条，总统需要在当选后尽快就职，而现代交通的便利, 使得新总统能够比以往更快地抵达首都。 1955 年新增的第二十二修正案, 限制总统任期为两届；而 1789 年首次提交批准的第二十七修正案, 则规范了有关国会议员加薪或减薪的法律的实施。

Of the remaining amendments, four are of especially great significance. The Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments are the result of long-fought campaigns by supporters of abolition and the expansion of voting rights to all citizens regardless of gender or race. These campaigns gathered momentum during the Reconstruction Era, when prominent abolitionist Frederick Douglass argued that African American men had earned the right to vote by their service during the Civil War and women’s rights leaders such as Susan B. Anthony and Ida B. Wells organized to promote voting rights for women.


[.my2]
在其余修正案中，有四条尤为重要。第十三、十四、十五和十九修正案, 是"废奴主义者"和"争取所有公民（无论性别或种族）享有投票权"的倡导者们, 长期斗争的成果。这些运动在"重建时期"蓬勃发展，当时著名的废奴主义者弗雷德里克·道格拉斯认为，**非裔美国男性因其在内战中的服役, 而赢得了投票权；**而苏珊·B·安东尼和艾达·B·威尔斯等女权领袖则组织起来，积极推动妇女的投票权。

废奴主义者和妇女参政论者 夏洛特·福顿·格里姆格

More than a century before Amanda Gorman wowed the country with her inspirational poem at the 2021 inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, another African American woman poet was making a difference in Washington, DC.

[.my2]
一个多世纪前，阿曼达· 戈尔曼在 2021 年乔·拜登总统和卡马拉·哈里斯副总统就职典礼上, 朗诵了鼓舞人心的诗歌，震惊了全国，而在此之前，另一位非裔美国女诗人, 已经在华盛顿特区发挥着重要作用。


Charlotte Forten was born in Philadelphia in 1837 to a prominent family of abolitionists. She later became a teacher and writer, and, in her work, advanced the causes of women's suffrage and the abolition of slavery. During the Civil War, she taught newly freed enslaved people in South Carolina and later moved to Washington, DC, where she taught secondary school, wrote poetry, and participated in social movements related to race and gender, including helping establish the National Association of Colored Women and fighting for a woman’s right to vote. In 1878, she married Francis J. Grimké, the nephew of famed abolitionists Sarah and Angelina Grimké. Today, her longtime home in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington is on the National Register of Historic Places.19

夏洛特·福滕于 1837 年出生于费城一个著名的废奴主义者家庭。她后来成为一名教师和作家，并致力于"推动妇女选举权", 和"废除奴隶制"的事业。内战期间，她在南卡罗来纳州, 教导新近获得自由的奴隶，之后移居华盛顿特区，在那里她从事中学教学、诗歌创作，并积极参与与"种族和性别相关"的社会运动，包括协助建立"全国有色妇女协会", 和争取妇女选举权。1878 年，她与著名废奴主义者莎拉·格里姆克, 和安吉丽娜·格里姆克的侄子弗朗西斯·J·格里姆克结婚。 如今 ，她位于华盛顿杜邦环岛附近的故居, 已被列入国家史迹名录。

Among her many publications is the inspirational poem “Wordsworth,” written in honor of Romantic poet William Wordsworth, one of her favorite authors.

[.my2]
在她众多的出版物中，有一首鼓舞人心的诗歌《华兹华斯》，这首诗是为了纪念她最喜欢的作家之一——浪漫主义诗人威廉·华兹华斯而作。

Poet of the serene and thoughtful lay!
In youth’s fair dawn, when the soul, still untried,
Longs for life’s conflict, and seeks restlessly
Food for its cravings in the stirring songs,
The thrilling strains of more impassioned bards;
Or, eager for fresh joys, culls with delight
The flowers that bloom in fancy’s fairy realm —
We may not prize the mild and steadfast ray
That streams from thy pure soul in tranquil song
But, in our riper years, when through the heat
And burden of the day we struggle on,
Breasting the stream upon whose shores we dreamed,
Weary of all the turmoil and the din
Which drowns the finer voices of the soul;
We turn to thee, true priest of Nature’s fane,
And find the rest our fainting spirits need, —
The calm, more ardent singers cannot give;
As in the glare intense of tropic days,
Gladly we turn from the sun’s radiant beams,
And grateful hail fair Luna’s tender light.


[.my2]
Poet of the serene and thoughtful lay! 宁静而深思之歌的诗人啊！In youth’s fair dawn, when the soul, still untried, 在青春美好的黎明，当灵魂尚未经受磨练， Longs for life’s conflict, and seeks restlessly 渴望着人生的搏斗，并在躁动中寻觅， Food for its cravings in the stirring songs, 在那些动人心魄的歌谣里，寻找喂养渴望的食粮， The thrilling strains of more impassioned bards; 那是更为激情澎湃的诗人所谱出的震撼旋律； Or, eager for fresh joys, culls with delight 或者，因渴求新鲜的欢愉，而欣然采撷 The flowers that bloom in fancy’s fairy realm — 那些盛开在幻想仙境中的花朵—— We may not prize the mild and steadfast ray 那时，我们或许并不珍视那温和而坚定的光芒， That streams from thy pure soul in tranquil song 它从你纯洁的灵魂中流淌，化作恬静的歌唱。But, in our riper years, when through the heat 但在我们成熟的岁月中，当穿过白昼的 And burden of the day we struggle on, 酷暑与重负，我们艰难前行， Breasting the stream upon whose shores we dreamed, 在曾经梦想过的岸边，逆着激流搏击， Weary of all the turmoil and the din 厌倦了所有的喧嚣与嘈杂—— Which drowns the finer voices of the soul; 它们淹没了灵魂深处更为纤细的声音； We turn to thee, true priest of Nature’s fane, 我们转向你，自然神殿里真正的祭司， And find the rest our fainting spirits need, — 找到了我们疲惫精神所需的安息，—— The calm, more ardent singers cannot give; 那是更热烈的歌手们所无法给予的宁静；As in the glare intense of tropic days, 正如在热带白昼强烈的眩目中， Gladly we turn from the sun’s radiant beams, 我们欣喜地避开太阳灿烂的光芒， And grateful hail fair Luna’s tender light. 心怀感激地欢呼月亮女神那温柔的清辉。

Charlotte Forten Grimké 和 Amanda Gorman 都用诗歌的声音, 在充满挑战的时代给国家带来了希望。美国还面临过哪些挑战？

The Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments, ratified at the end of the Civil War, changed the lives of African Americans who had been held in slavery. The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery in the United States. The Fourteenth Amendment granted citizenship to African Americans and equal protection under the law regardless of race or color. It also prohibited states from depriving their residents of life, liberty, or property without a legal proceeding. Over the years, the Fourteenth Amendment has been used to require states to protect most of the same federal freedoms granted by the Bill of Rights.

[.my2]
内战结束后批准的第十三、十四和十五修正案, 改变了曾被奴役的非裔美国人的命运。 第十三修正案废除了美国的奴隶制。 第十四修正案赋予非裔美国人公民权，并规定无论种族或肤色，都享有"法律面前人人平等"的保护。该修正案还禁止各州未经法律程序 剥夺其居民的生命、自由或财产。多年来，第十四修正案一直被用来要求各州保护《权利法案》所赋予的大部分联邦自由。

The Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments extended the right to vote. The Constitution had given states the power to set voting requirements, but the states had used this authority to deny women the right to vote. Most states before the 1830s had also used this authority to deny suffrage to property-less men and often to African American men as well. When states began to change property requirements for voters in the 1830s, many that had allowed free, property-owning African American men to vote restricted the suffrage to White men. The Fifteenth Amendment gave men the right to vote regardless of race or color, but women were still prohibited from voting in most states. After many years of campaigns for suffrage, as shown in Figure 2.16, the Nineteenth Amendment finally gave women the right to vote in 1920.

[.my2]
第十五和第十九修正案扩大了投票权。**宪法赋予各州"制定投票资格"的权力，但各州却利用这一权力, 剥夺了妇女的投票权。**在 19 世纪 30 年代之前，大多数州还利用这一权力, 剥夺了无财产男性，以及通常也包括非裔美国男性的选举权。19 世纪 30 年代，当各州开始修改"投票的财产资格要求"时，许多原本允许"拥有财产的'自由非裔美国男性'来投票"的州，却将选举权限制在了白人男性身上。 第十五修正案赋予了男性不分种族或肤色的投票权，但大多数州仍然禁止妇女投票。经过多年的"争取选举权"的运动（ 如图 2.16 所示）， 第十九修正案最终在 *1920 年赋予了妇女投票权。*

Subsequent amendments further extended the suffrage. The Twenty-Third Amendment (1961) allowed residents of Washington, DC to vote for the president. The Twenty-Fourth Amendment (1964) abolished the use of poll taxes. Many southern states had used a poll tax, a tax placed on voting, to prevent poor African Americans from voting. Thus, the states could circumvent the Fifteenth Amendment; they argued that they were denying African American men and women the right to vote not because of their race but because of their inability to pay the tax. The last great extension of the suffrage occurred in 1971 in the midst of the Vietnam War. The Twenty-Sixth Amendment reduced the voting age from twenty-one to eighteen. Many people had complained that the young men who were fighting in Vietnam should have the right to vote for or against those making decisions that might literally mean life or death for them. Many other amendments have been proposed over the years, including an amendment to guarantee equal rights to women, but all have failed.

[.my2]
随后的修正案进一步扩大了选举权。 第二十三修正案 （1961 年）允许华盛顿特区的居民,投票选举总统。 第二十四修正案 （1964 年）废除了人头税。**许多南方州曾征收人头税，即"对投票权征税"，以此阻止贫困的非裔美国人投票。**因此，这些州可以规避第十五修正案；**他们辩称，剥夺非裔美国男女的投票权, 并非因为他们的种族，而是因为他们无力缴纳税款。**选举权的最后一次重大扩展, 发生在 1971 年越南战争期间。 第二十六修正案**将投票年龄从 21 岁降低到 18 岁。**许多人抱怨说，那些在越南作战的年轻人, 应该有权投票支持或反对"那些可能关乎他们生死存亡的决策者"。多年来，人们提出了许多其他修正案，包括"保障妇女平等权利"的修正案，但所有这些修正案都未获通过。

Figure 2.16 Suffragists encourage Ohio men to support votes for women. Before the Nineteenth Amendment was added to the Constitution in 1920, there were only a few western states such as Wyoming in which women had the right to vote.
