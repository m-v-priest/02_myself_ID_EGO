== 释义





We have discussed the two major political parties in the United States, how they formed, and some of the smaller parties that have challenged their dominance over time. However, what exactly do political parties do? If the purpose of political parties is to work together to create and implement policies by winning elections, how do they accomplish this task, and who actually participates in the process?
我们已经讨论了美国的两大政党、它们的形成过程，以及一些挑战其主导地位的小党派。然而，政党究竟是做什么的？如果政党的目的是通过赢得选举来共同制定和实施政策，那么它们是如何完成这项任务的？又有哪些人真正参与到这个过程中来？

The answer was fairly straightforward in the early days of the republic when parties were little more than electoral coalitions of like-minded, elite politicians. But improvements in strategy and changes in the electorate forced the parties to become far more complex organizations that operate on several levels in the U.S. political arena. Modern political parties consist of three components identified by political scientist V. O. Key: the party in the electorate (the voters); the party organization (which helps to coordinate everything the party does in its quest for office); and the party in office (the office holders). To understand how these various elements work together, we begin by thinking about a key first step in influencing policy in any democracy: winning elections.

[.my2]
在共和国早期，政党不过是志同道合的精英政治家组成的选举联盟，答案相当简单明了。但随着策略的改进和选民结构的变化，政党被迫发展成为更为复杂的组织，在美国政治舞台上多层次运作。政治学家 V.O. Key 指出，现代政党由三个部分组成：选民群体（选民）；政党组织（负责协调政党在竞选过程中的一切行动）；以及执政党（官员）。为了理解这些要素如何协同运作，我们首先要思考在任何民主政体中影响政策的关键第一步：赢得选举。

THE PARTY-IN-THE-ELECTORATE
政党在选民中
A key fact about the U.S. political party system is that it’s all about the votes. If voters do not show up to vote for a party’s candidates on Election Day, the party has no chance of gaining office and implementing its preferred policies. As we have seen, for much of their history, the two parties have been adapting to changes in the size, composition, and preferences of the U.S. electorate. It only makes sense, then, that parties have found it in their interest to build a permanent and stable presence among the voters. By fostering a sense of loyalty, a party can insulate itself from changes in the system and improve its odds of winning elections. The party-in-the-electorate are those members of the voting public who consider themselves to be part of a political party and/or who consistently prefer the candidates of one party over the other.

[.my2]
美国政党制度的一个关键事实是，一切都取决于选票。如果选民在选举日不出来投票支持某个政党的候选人，该政党就没有任何机会赢得执政权，也无法推行其推行的政策。正如我们所见，在很长一段时间里，两大政党都在不断适应美国选民规模、构成和偏好的变化。因此，政党寻求在选民中建立长期稳定的影响力也就不足为奇了。通过培养选民的忠诚度，政党可以抵御制度变化的影响，并提高其赢得选举的几率。 选民中的“政党拥护者”指的是那些认为自己属于某个政党，或者始终倾向于支持某一政党候选人的选民。

What it means to be part of a party depends on where a voter lives and how much they choose to participate in politics. At its most basic level, being a member of the party-in-the-electorate simply means a voter is more likely to voice support for a party. These voters are often called party identifiers, since they usually represent themselves in public as being members of a party, and they may attend some party events or functions. Party identifiers are also more likely to provide financial support for the candidates of their party during election season. This does not mean self-identified Democrats will support all the party’s positions or candidates, but it does mean that, on the whole, they feel their wants or needs are more likely to be met if the Democratic Party is successful.

[.my2]
加入某个政党意味着什么，取决于选民的居住地以及他们参与政治的程度。最基本的层面来说，成为选区内某个政党的成员仅仅意味着选民更有可能公开支持该政党。这些选民通常被称为 “政党认同者” ，因为他们通常会在公开场合表明自己是某个政党的成员，并且可能会参加一些政党活动。政党认同者也更有可能在选举季为本党候选人提供经济支持。这并不意味着自认为是民主党人的人会支持该党的所有立场或候选人，但这确实意味着，总体而言，他们认为如果民主党获胜，他们的愿望或需求更有可能得到满足。

Party identifiers make up the majority of the voting public. Gallup, the polling agency, has been collecting data on voter preferences for the past several decades. Its research suggests that historically, over half of American adults have called themselves “Republican” or “Democrat” when asked how they identify themselves politically (Figure 9.8). Even among self-proclaimed independents, the overwhelming majority claim to lean in the direction of one party or the other, suggesting they behave as if they identified with a party during elections even if they preferred not to publicly pick a side. Partisan support is so strong that, in a poll conducted from August 5 to August 9, 2015, about 88 percent of respondents said they either identified with or, if they were independents, at least leaned toward one of the major political parties.38 Thus, in a poll conducted in January 2016, even though about 42 percent of respondents said they were independent, this does not mean that they are not, in fact, more likely to favor one party over the other.39
政党认同者构成了选民的大多数。民调机构盖洛普在过去几十年里一直在收集选民偏好数据。其研究表明，历史上，超过半数的美国成年人在被问及政治立场时，会称自己为“共和党人”或“民主党人”（ 图 9.8 ）。即使在自称独立人士的人群中，绝大多数人也表示倾向于某个政党，这表明他们在选举期间的行为就像认同某个政党一样，即使他们不愿公开表明立场。党派支持如此强烈，以至于在 2015 年 8 月 5 日至 9 日进行的一项民意调查中，约 88%的受访者表示他们认同某个主要政党，或者如果他们是独立人士，至少倾向于某个主要政党。 38 因此，在 2016 年 1 月进行的一项民意调查中，尽管约 42%的受访者表示自己是独立人士，但这并不意味着他们实际上不会更倾向于某个政党。 39

A series of four graphs titled “Party Identification by Generation, 2004-2014”. The x-axis of all graphs starts at the year 2004 and ends at the year 2016. The y-axis of all graphs starts at 30% and ends at 60%. For the graph labeled “Silent”, a line labeled “Leaning Republican” begins at 43% in 2004, decreases to 40% in 2006, decreases to 38% in 2008, increases to 47% in 2012, and decreases then increases to 47% in 2014, and increases to 52% in 2016. A line labeled “Leaning Democrat” begins at 48% in 2004, increases slightly then decreases slightly back to 48% in 2008, decreases to 45% in 2010, decreases to 43% in 2012, increases slightly then decreases to 42% in 2014, then decreases to 41% in 2016. For the graph labeled “Boomer”, a line labeled “Leaning Republican” begins at 40% in 2004, decreases to 38% in 2008, increases to 41% in 2010, decreases to 40% in 2012, increases then decreases to 40% in 2014, and increases to 48% in 2016. A line labeled “Leaning Democrat” begins at 47% in 2004, increases slightly to 49% in 2008, decreases to 45% in 2010, increases to 47% in 2012, decreases to 46% in 2014, and decreases to 45% in 2016. For the graph labeled “Gen X”, a line labeled “Leaning Republican” begins at 42% in 2004, decreases to 35% in 2008, increases to 40% in 2010, decreases to 39% in 2012, increases then decreases to 38% in 2014, then increases to 43% in 2016. A line labeled “Leaning Democrat” begins at 45% in 2004, increases to 50% in 2008, decreases to 45% in 2010, increases to 49% in 2014, and decreases to 48% in 2016. For the graph labeled “Millennial”, a line labeled “Leaning Republican” begins at 37% in 2004, decreases to 30% in 2008, increases to 34% in 2010, increases then decreases to 34% in 2012, maintains 34% in 2014, and increases to 35% in 2016. A line labeled “Leaning Democrat” begins at 50% in 2004, increases to 55% in 2008, decreases to 51% in 2010, increases to 52% in 2012, decreases to 50% in 2014, and increases to 57% in 2016. At the bottom of the graphs, a source is listed: “Pew Research Center. “Party Identification Trends, 1992-2017.” March 20, 2018”.”
Figure 9.8 As the chart reveals, generation affects party identification. Millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) are more likely to identify as or lean towards the Democratic Party and less likely to favor Republicans than are their Baby Boomer parents and grandparents (born between 1946 and 1964). Gen Z (those born from 1997 onward) continue this trend, while also having a larger proportion than other generations of independents.40
图 9.8 显示了世代对党派认同的影响。千禧一代（1981 年至 1996 年出生）比他们的婴儿潮一代父母和祖父母（1946 年至 1964 年出生）更倾向于认同民主党或支持民主党，而不太可能支持共和党。Z 世代（1997 年及以后出生）延续了这一趋势，同时，与其他世代相比，他们的独立人士比例也更高。 40
Strictly speaking, party identification is not quite the same thing as party membership. People may call themselves Republicans or Democrats without being registered as a member of the party, and the Republican and Democratic parties do not require individuals to join their formal organization in the same way that parties in some other countries do. Many states require voters to declare a party affiliation before participating in primaries, but primary participation is irregular and infrequent, and a voter may change identities long before changing party registration. For most voters, party identification is informal at best and often matters only in the weeks before an election. It does matter, however, because party identification guides some voters, who may know little about a particular issue or candidate, in casting their ballots. If, for example, someone thinks of themself as a Republican and always votes Republican, they will not be confused when faced with a candidate, perhaps in a local or county election, whose name is unfamiliar. If the candidate is a Republican, the voter will likely cast a ballot for that candidate.

[.my2]
严格来说，党派认同与党员身份并不完全相同。人们可以自称共和党人或民主党人，而无需注册成为该党成员。共和党和民主党也不像某些国家的政党那样，要求个人加入其正式组织。许多州要求选民在参加初选前声明党派归属，但初选参与并不普遍，选民可能在更改党派登记之前很久就改变身份。对大多数选民而言，党派认同充其量只是非正式的，通常只在选举前几周才重要。然而，党派认同确实重要，因为它可以引导一些对特定议题或候选人知之甚少的选民投票。例如，如果有人认为自己是共和党人，并且总是投票给共和党人，那么当他们在地方或县级选举中遇到一位名字陌生的候选人时，就不会感到困惑。如果这位候选人是共和党人，那么这位选民很可能会投票给这位候选人。

Party ties can manifest in other ways as well. The actual act of registering to vote and selecting a party reinforces party loyalty. Moreover, while pundits and scholars often deride voters who blindly vote their party, the selection of a party in the first place can be based on issue positions and ideology. In that regard, voting your party on Election Day is not a blind act—it is a shortcut based on issue positions.

[.my2]
党派关系还可以通过其他方式体现。实际的选民登记和选择政党的行为本身就能强化党派忠诚度。此外，尽管评论员和学者经常嘲讽那些盲目投票给党派的选民，但最初选择政党可能正是基于其政策立场和意识形态。从这个角度来看，在选举日投票给本党并非盲目之举，而是一种基于政策立场的捷径。

THE PARTY ORGANIZATION  党组织
A significant subset of American voters views their party identification as something far beyond simply a shortcut to voting. These individuals get more energized by the political process and have chosen to become more active in the life of political parties. They are part of what is known as the party organization. The party organization is the formal structure of the political party, and its active members are responsible for coordinating party behavior and supporting party candidates. It is a vital component of any successful party because it bears most of the responsibility for building and maintaining the party “brand.” It also plays a key role in helping select, and elect, candidates for public office.

[.my2]
相当一部分美国选民认为，他们的党派认同远不止是投票的捷径。这些人对政治进程充满热情，并选择更积极地参与政党活动。他们是所谓的政党组织的一部分。 政党组织是政党的正式架构，其活跃成员负责协调党内行为并支持党内候选人。它是任何成功政党不可或缺的组成部分，因为它承担着建立和维护政党“品牌”的大部分责任。它在帮助遴选和选举公职候选人方面也发挥着关键作用。

Local Organizations  地方组织
Since winning elections is the first goal of the political party, it makes sense that the formal party organization mirrors the local-state-federal structure of the U.S. political system. While the lowest level of party organization is technically the precinct, many of the operational responsibilities for local elections fall upon the county-level organization. The county-level organization is in many ways the workhorse of the party system, especially around election time. This level of organization frequently takes on many of the most basic responsibilities of a democratic system, including identifying and mobilizing potential voters and donors, identifying and training potential candidates for public office, and recruiting new members for the party. County organizations are also often responsible for finding rank and file members to serve as volunteers on Election Day, either as officials responsible for operating the polls or as monitors responsible for ensuring that elections are conducted honestly and fairly. They may also hold regular meetings to provide members the opportunity to meet potential candidates and coordinate strategy (Figure 9.9). Of course, all this is voluntary and relies on dedicated party members being willing to pitch in to run the party.

[.my2]
赢得选举是政党的首要目标，因此，政党的正式组织结构与美国政治体系的地方-州-联邦结构相呼应也就不足为奇了。虽然从技术上讲，政党组织的最低层级是选区 ，但许多地方选举的运作职责都落在了县级组织身上。县级组织在很多方面都是政党体系的中坚力量，尤其是在选举期间。这一层级的组织通常承担着民主制度中许多最基本的职责，包括识别和动员潜在选民和捐助者、识别和培训潜在的公职候选人以及招募新党员。县级组织通常还负责寻找普通党员在选举日担任志愿者，他们或是负责运营投票站的官员，或是负责确保选举公正公平进行的监督员。他们也可能定期召开会议，让党员有机会与潜在候选人会面并协调策略（ 图 9.9 ）。当然，所有这些都是自愿的，并且依赖于忠诚的党员愿意为政党的运作贡献力量。

State Organizations  国家组织
Most of the county organizations’ formal efforts are devoted to supporting party candidates running for county and city offices. But a fair amount of political power is held by individuals in statewide office or in state-level legislative or judicial bodies. While the county-level offices may be active in these local competitions, most of the coordination for them will take place in the state-level organizations. Like their more local counterparts, state-level organizations are responsible for key party functions, such as statewide candidate recruitment and campaign mobilization. Most of their efforts focus on electing high-ranking officials such as the governor or occupants of other statewide offices (e.g., the state’s treasurer or attorney general) as well as candidates to represent the state and its residents in the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives. The greater value of state- and national-level offices requires state organizations to take on several key responsibilities in the life of the party.

[.my2]
县级组织的大部分正式工作都致力于支持竞选县级和市级公职的党内候选人。但相当一部分政治权力掌握在州级官员或州级立法机构、司法机构的官员手中。虽然县级组织可能积极参与这些地方选举，但大部分协调工作将在州级组织中进行。与地方组织一样，州级组织负责关键的党务职能，例如全州范围内的候选人招募和竞选动员。他们的大部分精力都集中在选举高级官员，例如州长或其他州级官员（例如州财政部长或州检察长），以及代表本州及其居民进入美国参议院和众议院的候选人。州级和国家级职位的重要性要求州级组织在党的运作中承担若干关键职责。

First, state-level organizations usually accept greater fundraising responsibilities than do their local counterparts. Statewide races and races for national office have become increasingly expensive in recent years. The average cost of a successful House campaign was $2.4 million in 2020; for Senate races, it was $27.2 million.41 While individual candidates are responsible for funding and running their own races, it is typically up to the state-level organization to coordinate giving across multiple races and to develop the staffing expertise that these candidates will draw upon at election time.

[.my2]
首先，州级组织通常比地方组织承担更大的筹款责任。近年来，州级和全国性公职竞选的成本日益高昂。2020 年，一场成功的众议院竞选平均花费为 240 万美元；参议院竞选则高达 2720 万美元。 41 虽然候选人个人负责筹集和开展竞选活动，但通常情况下，州级组织需要协调多场竞选的捐款，并培养候选人在选举时所需的专业人才。

State organizations are also responsible for creating a sense of unity among members of the state party. Building unity can be very important as the party transitions from sometimes-contentious nomination battles to the all-important general election. The state organization uses several key tools to get its members working together towards a common goal. First, it helps the party’s candidates prepare for state primary elections or caucuses that allow voters to choose a nominee to run for public office at either the state or national level. Caucuses are a form of town hall meeting at which voters in a precinct get together to voice their preferences, rather than voting individually throughout the day (Figure 9.10).

[.my2]
州级组织还负责在州党成员中营造团结感。在党从有时充满争议的提名战过渡到至关重要的大选之际，建立团结至关重要。州级组织运用多种关键工具，促使其成员朝着共同目标努力。首先，它帮助党内候选人准备州初选或党团会议，选民可以通过这些会议选出代表该候选人竞选州级或国家级公职。党团会议是一种市政厅式的会议，同一选区的选民聚集在一起表达他们的意愿，而不是像往常那样在一天中单独投票（ 图 9.10 ）。

Second, the state organization is also responsible for drafting a state platform that serves as a policy guide for partisans who are eventually selected to public office. These platforms are usually the result of a negotiation between the various coalitions within the party and are designed to ensure that everyone in the party will receive some benefits if their candidates win the election. Finally, state organizations hold a statewide convention at which delegates from the various county organizations come together to discuss the needs of their areas. The state conventions are also responsible for selecting delegates to the national convention.

[.my2]
其次，州级组织还负责起草州级纲领 ，作为最终当选公职人员的党员的政策指导。这些纲领通常是党内各联盟协商的结果，旨在确保如果其候选人赢得选举，党内所有成员都能从中受益。最后，州级组织会召开全州代表大会，各县级组织的代表齐聚一堂，讨论各自地区的需求。州级代表大会还负责选出参加全国代表大会的代表。

National Party Organization
全国党组织
The local and state-level party organizations are the workhorses of the political process. They take on most of the responsibility for party activities and are easily the most active participants in the party formation and electoral processes. They are also largely invisible to most voters. The average citizen knows very little of the local party’s behavior unless there is a phone call or a knock on the door in the days or weeks before an election. The same is largely true of the activities of the state-level party. Typically, the only people who notice are those who are already actively engaged in politics or are being targeted for donations.

[.my2]
地方和州级政党组织是政治进程的中坚力量。它们承担着大部分党务活动的责任，并且无疑是政党组建和选举过程中最积极的参与者。然而，对于大多数选民来说，它们却几乎不为人知。除非在选举前几天或几周接到电话或有人上门拜访，否则普通民众对地方政党的活动知之甚少。州级政党的活动也大致如此。通常情况下，只有那些已经积极参与政治或成为捐款目标的人才会注意到这些活动。

But most people are aware of the presence and activity of the national party organizations for several reasons. First, many Americans, especially young people, are more interested in the topics discussed at the national level than at the state or local level. According to John Green of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics, “Local elections tend to be about things like sewers, and roads and police protection—which are not as dramatic an issue as same-sex marriage or global warming or international affairs.”42 Presidential elections and the behavior of the U.S. Congress are also far more likely to make the news broadcasts than the activities of county commissioners, and the national-level party organization is mostly responsible for coordinating the activities of participants at this level. The national party is a fundraising army for presidential candidates and also serves a key role in trying to coordinate and direct the efforts of the House and Senate. For this reason, its leadership is far more likely to become visible to media consumers, whether they intend to vote or not.

[.my2]
但大多数人之所以了解全国性政党组织的存在和活动，原因有几个。首先，许多美国人，尤其是年轻人，对国家层面的议题比对州或地方层面的议题更感兴趣。雷·C·布利斯应用政治研究所的约翰 ·格林指出：“地方选举往往围绕下水道、道路和警务等问题展开——这些问题远不如同性婚姻、全球变暖或国际事务那样引人注目。” 42 总统选举和美国国会的行为也比县政委员的活动更容易出现在新闻报道中，而全国性政党组织主要负责协调这一层级的活动。全国性政党是总统候选人的筹款大军，并在协调和指导众议院和参议院的工作方面发挥着关键作用。因此，无论媒体受众是否打算投票，他们的领导层都更容易被媒体关注。

A second reason for the prominence of the national organization is that it usually coordinates the grandest spectacles in the life of a political party. Most voters are never aware of the numerous county-level meetings or coordinating activities. Primary elections, one of the most important events to take place at the state level, have a much lower turnout than the nationwide general election. In 2012, for example, only one-third of the eligible voters in New Hampshire voted in the state’s primary, one of the earliest and thus most important in the nation; however, 70 percent of eligible voters in the state voted in the general election in November 2012.43 People may see or read an occasional story about the meetings of the state committees or convention but pay little attention. But the national conventions, organized and sponsored by the national-level party, can dominate the national discussion for several weeks in late summer, a time when the major media outlets are often searching for news. These conventions are the definition of a media circus at which high-ranking politicians, party elites, and sometimes celebrities, such as actor/director Clint Eastwood (Figure 9.11), along with individuals many consider to be the future leaders of the party are brought before the public so the party can make its best case for being the one to direct the future of the country.44 National party conventions culminate in the formal nomination of the party nominees for the offices of president and vice president, and they mark the official beginning of the presidential competition between the two parties.

[.my2]
全国性组织之所以如此重要，第二个原因是它通常负责协调政党生活中最盛大的活动。大多数选民根本不了解众多县级会议或协调活动。初选是州一级最重要的活动之一，但其投票率远低于全国大选。例如，2012 年，新罕布什尔州只有三分之一的合格选民参加了该州的初选，而该州的初选是全国最早、最重要的初选之一；然而，在 2012 年 11 月的大选中，该州 70 %的合格选民都参与了投票。人们或许偶尔会看到或读到一些关于州委员会会议或代表大会的报道，但往往并不在意。然而，由全国性政党组织和主办的全国代表大会 ，却能在夏末的几周内主导全国舆论，而此时各大媒体往往都在寻找新闻素材。这些党代会堪称媒体的盛宴，高级政客、党内精英，有时还有像演员/导演克林特·伊斯特伍德（ 图 9.11 ）这样的名人，以及许多人眼中未来的党内领袖，都会被带到公众面前，以便该党能够充分阐述其作为国家未来领导人的主张。44 全国党代会的最终环节是正式提名总统和副总统候选人，这也标志着两党总统候选人提名之争的正式开始。

In the past, national conventions were often the sites of high drama and political intrigue. As late as 1968, the identities of the presidential and/or vice-presidential nominees were still unknown to the general public when the convention opened. It was also common for groups protesting key events and issues of the day to try to raise their profile by using the conventions to gain the media spotlight. National media outlets would provide “gavel to gavel” coverage of the conventions, and the relatively limited number of national broadcast channels meant most viewers were essentially forced to choose between following the conventions or checking out of the media altogether. Much has changed since the 1960s, however, and between 1960 and 2004, viewership of both the Democratic National Convention and the Republican National Convention had declined by half.45
过去，全国代表大会往往是充满戏剧性和政治阴谋的场所。直到 1968 年，大会开幕时，总统和/或副总统候选人的身份仍然不为公众所知。抗议时事热点和议题的团体也常常试图利用大会来提升自身影响力，博取媒体关注。全国性媒体会对大会进行全程报道，而当时全国性广播频道数量相对有限，这意味着大多数观众实际上只能在观看大会和完全放弃媒体之间做出选择。然而，自 20 世纪 60 年代以来，情况发生了很大变化。1960 年至 2004 年间，民主党全国代表大会和共和党全国代表大会的收视率均下降了一半。 45

National conventions are not the spectacles they once were, and this fact is almost certainly having an impact on the profile of the national party organization. Both parties have come to recognize the value of the convention as a medium through which they can communicate to the average viewer. To ensure that they are viewed in the best possible light, the parties have worked hard to turn the public face of the convention into a highly sanitized, highly orchestrated media event. Speakers are often required to have their speeches prescreened to ensure that they do not deviate from the party line or run the risk of embarrassing the eventual nominee—whose name has often been known by all for several months. And while protests still happen, party organizations have becoming increasingly adept at keeping protesters away from the convention sites, arguing that safety and security are more important than First Amendment rights to speech and peaceable assembly. For example, protestors were kept behind concrete barriers and fences at the Democratic National Convention in 2004.46
全国代表大会已不再像过去那样盛大，这一事实几乎肯定会对全国性政党组织的形象产生影响。两党都已意识到大会作为与普通民众沟通的媒介的价值。为了确保自身形象达到最佳，两党都竭力将大会的公众形象打造成一场经过精心包装和周密安排的媒体活动。演讲者通常需要事先审查演讲稿，以确保其内容不偏离党派路线，或可能令最终的候选人难堪——而这位候选人的名字往往几个月前就已经人尽皆知。尽管抗议活动依然存在，但政党组织越来越擅长将抗议者拒之门外，并声称安全保障比宪法第一修正案赋予的言论自由和和平集会权利更为重要。例如，在 2004 年民主党全国代表大会上，抗议者就被隔离在混凝土路障和围栏之后。 46

With the advent of cable TV news and the growth of internet blogging, the major news outlets have found it unnecessary to provide the same level of coverage they once did. Between 1976 and 1996, ABC and CBS cut their coverage of the nominating conventions from more than fifty hours to only five. NBC cut its coverage to fewer than five hours.47 One reason may be that the outcome of nominating conventions are also typically known in advance, meaning there is no drama. Today, the nominee’s acceptance speech is expected to be no longer than an hour, so it will not take up more than one block of prime-time TV programming.

随着有线电视新闻的出现和网络博客的兴起，主流新闻媒体发现没有必要像以前那样提供同样多的报道。1976 年至 1996 年间，ABC 和 CBS 将提名大会的报道时长从 50 多个小时削减到仅 5 个小时。NBC 的报道时长也缩减到不足 5 个小时。 47 其中一个原因可能是，提名大会的结果通常提前已知，这意味着缺乏戏剧性。如今，候选人的接受提名演讲预计不会超过一个小时，因此不会占用超过一个黄金时段的电视节目。

This is not to say the national conventions are no longer important, or that the national party organizations are becoming less relevant. The conventions, and the organizations that run them, still contribute heavily to a wide range of key decisions in the life of both parties. The national party platform is formally adopted at the convention, as are the key elements of the strategy for contesting the national campaign. And even though the media is paying less attention, key insiders and major donors often use the convention as a way of gauging the strength of the party and its ability to effectively organize and coordinate its members. They are also paying close attention to the rising stars who are given time at the convention’s podium, to see which are able to connect with the party faithful. Most observers credit Barack Obama’s speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention with bringing him to national prominence.48
这并非意味着全国代表大会不再重要，或者全国性政党组织的重要性正在下降。全国代表大会及其组织仍然对两党的诸多关键决策产生重大影响。全国党纲在大会上正式通过，全国竞选战略的关键要素也在此确定。尽管媒体关注度有所下降，但关键的内部人士和主要捐助者常常利用全国代表大会来评估党的实力及其有效组织和协调党员的能力。他们也密切关注那些在大会讲台上崭露头角的政坛新星，观察他们能否与党内忠实拥护者建立联系。大多数观察家认为，巴拉克·奥巴马在 2004 年民主党全国代表大会上的演讲是他走向全国瞩目的关键。 48

While both political parties use conventions to help win the current elections, they also use them as a way of elevating local politicians to the national spotlight. This has been particularly true for the Democratic Party. In 1988, the Democrats tapped Arkansas governor Bill Clinton to introduce their nominee Michael Dukakis at the convention. Clinton’s speech was lampooned for its length and lack of focus, but it served to get his name in front of Democratic voters. Four years later, Clinton was able to leverage this national exposure to help his own presidential campaign. The pattern was repeated when Illinois state senator Barack Obama gave the keynote address at the 2004 convention. Although he was only a candidate for the U.S. Senate at the time, his address caught the attention of the Democratic establishment and ultimately led to his emergence as a viable presidential candidate just four years later.

虽然两党都利用党代会来赢得当前的选举，但他们也将其作为提升地方政治人物在全国范围内知名度的途径。这一点在民主党身上尤为突出。1988 年，民主党邀请阿肯色州州长比尔· 克林顿在党代会上介绍他们的总统候选人迈克尔·杜卡基斯。克林顿的演讲因冗长和缺乏重点而遭到嘲讽，但却成功地让民主党选民记住了他的名字。四年后，克林顿利用这次全国性的曝光度，助力了自己的总统竞选。类似的模式在 2004 年党代会上再次出现，当时伊利诺伊州参议员巴拉克·奥巴马发表了主旨演讲。尽管他当时只是美国参议员的候选人，但他的演讲引起了民主党建制派的关注，并最终促成了他在四年后成为一位有竞争力的总统候选人。

THE PARTY-IN-GOVERNMENT  执政党
One of the first challenges facing the party-in-government, or the party identifiers who have been elected or appointed to hold public office, is to achieve their policy goals. The means to do this is chosen in meetings of the two major parties; Republican meetings are called party conferences and Democrat meetings are called party caucuses. Members of each party meet in these closed sessions and discuss what items to place on the legislative agenda and make decisions about which party members should serve on the committees that draft proposed laws. Party members also elect the leaders of their respective parties in the House and the Senate, and their party whips. Leaders serve as party managers and are the highest-ranking members of the party in each chamber of Congress. The party whip ensures that members are present when a piece of legislation is to be voted on and directs them how to vote. The whip is the second-highest ranking member of the party in each chamber. Thus, both the Republicans and the Democrats have a leader and a whip in the House, and a leader and a whip in the Senate. The leader and whip of the party that holds the majority of seats in each house are known as the majority leader and the majority whip. The leader and whip of the party with fewer seats are called the minority leader and the minority whip. The party that controls the majority of seats in the House of Representatives also elects someone to serve as Speaker of the House. People elected to Congress as independents (that is, not members of either the Republican or Democratic parties) must choose a party to conference or caucus with. For example, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who originally ran for Senate as an independent candidate, caucuses with the Democrats and ran for the presidency as a Democrat. He returned to the Senate in 2017 as an independent.49
执政党 ，或者说那些当选或被任命担任公职的政党代表，面临的首要挑战之一就是实现其政策目标。实现这一目标的途径由两大政党在会议上决定；共和党的会议称为党代会，民主党的会议称为党团会议。两党成员在这些闭门会议中讨论立法议程上的议题，并决定哪些党员应该进入起草法案的委员会。党员们还会选举各自党派在众议院和参议院的领袖以及党鞭。领袖是党的管理者，也是各自党派在国会两院中级别最高的成员。党鞭确保议员们在法案投票表决时出席，并指导他们的投票。党鞭是各自党派在两院中级别第二高的成员。因此，共和党和民主党在众议院都有领袖和党鞭，在参议院也各有一位领袖和一位党鞭。在参众两院中，拥有多数席位的政党的领袖和党鞭分别被称为多数党领袖和多数党党鞭。席位较少的政党的领袖和党鞭则分别被称为少数党领袖和少数党党鞭。在众议院拥有多数席位的政党还会选举一人担任众议院议长。以独立人士身份当选国会议员（即非共和党或民主党成员）的议员必须选择一个政党加入其党团会议或党团会议。 例如，佛蒙特州参议员伯尼·桑德斯最初以独立候选人身份竞选参议员，后来加入民主党党团会议，并以民主党人身份竞选总统。2017年，他以独立候选人身份重返参议院。49

The political parties in government must represent their parties and the entire country at the same time. One way they do this is by creating separate governing and party structures in the legislature, even though these are run by the same people. Check out some of the more important leadership organizations and their partisan counterparts in the House of Representatives and the Senate leadership.

执政的政党必须同时代表本党和整个国家。他们实现这一目标的方式之一是在立法机构中建立独立的执政机构和政党结构，尽管这些机构和结构是由同一批人运作的。不妨了解一下众议院和参议院中一些重要的领导机构及其对应的党派机构。

One problem facing the party-in-government relates to the design of the country’s political system. The U.S. government is based on a complex principle of separation of powers, with power divided among the executive, legislative, and judiciary branches. The system is further complicated by federalism, which relegates some powers to the states, which also have separation of powers. This complexity creates a number of problems for maintaining party unity. The biggest is that each level and unit of government has different constituencies that the office holder must satisfy. The person elected to the White House is more beholden to the national party organization than are members of the House or Senate, because members of Congress must be reelected by voters in very different states, each with its own state-level and county-level parties.

执政党面临的一个问题与美国政治体制的设计有关。美国政府基于复杂的三权分立原则，权力分散在行政、立法和司法三个部门之间。联邦制进一步加剧了这一体系的复杂性，它将部分权力下放给各州，而各州也实行三权分立。这种复杂性给维护党内团结带来了诸多难题。其中最大的难题在于，各级政府部门的选民群体各不相同，官员必须满足这些选民的需求。与众议院或参议院议员相比，当选总统的人更需要对全国性党组织负责，因为国会议员必须由来自不同州的选民连任，而每个州都有自己的州级和县级政党。

Some of this complexity is eased for the party that holds the executive branch of government. Executive offices are typically more visible to the voters than the legislature, in no small part because a single person holds the office. Voters are more likely to show up at the polls and vote if they feel strongly about the candidate running for president or governor, but they are also more likely to hold that person accountable for the government’s failures.50
对于掌控行政部门的政党而言，某些复杂性会得到缓解。行政部门通常比立法部门更容易被选民关注，这在很大程度上是因为行政部门由一人担任。如果选民对竞选总统或州长的候选人有强烈的支持，他们就更有可能前往投票站投票，同时也更有可能追究该候选人对政府失职的责任 。50

Members of the legislature from the executive’s party are under a great deal of pressure to make the executive look good, because a popular president or governor may be able to help other party members win office, or may support the primary opponent of an incumbent office holder. This incentive is likely why early in President Donald Trump’s second term of office, in 2025, that House and Senate Republicans chose not to challenge or protest the president’s aggressive moves, which started by challenging the judiciary, but eventually moved into areas of traditionally congressional power, including taxation, removing officials from independent regulatory commissions, and making personnel moves in institutions such as the Library of Congress.51
来自行政部门所在政党的立法机构成员面临着巨大的压力，他们必须维护行政部门的形象，因为一位受欢迎的总统或州长或许能够帮助其他党内成员赢得选举，或者支持现任官员的党内初选对手。这种动机很可能是导致唐纳德·特朗普总统第二个任期初期（2025 年）众议院和参议院的共和党人选择不对总统的激进举措提出质疑或抗议的原因。这些举措最初挑战司法部门，但最终蔓延到传统上属于国会权力的领域，包括税收、撤换独立监管委员会的官员以及对国会图书馆等机构的人事进行调整。 51

A second challenge is that each house of the legislature has its own leadership and committee structure, and those leaders may not be in total harmony with the president. Key benefits like committee appointments, leadership positions, and money for important projects in their home district may hinge on legislators following the lead of the party. These pressures are particularly acute for the majority party, so named because it controls more than half the seats in one of the two chambers. The Speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader, the majority party’s congressional leaders, have significant tools at their disposal to punish party members who defect on a particular vote. And, yet, when majority control is narrow, and the leaders need all members to unify, that puts individual members or coalitions of members in a strong position. We saw this dynamic emerge in the House between the Freedom Caucus of far-right Republicans and two House speakers–Kevin McCarthy and Mike Johnson. Speaker McCarthy was ousted from his position and Speaker Johnson continues to face challenges in unifying his party to the degree needed to pass budgets and legislation.52
第二个挑战是，立法机构的两院都有各自的领导层和委员会结构，而这些领导人可能与总统并非完全一致。诸如委员会任命、领导职位以及选区重要项目的资金等关键利益，可能取决于议员是否遵循党派的领导。这些压力对于多数党而言尤为突出，多数党之所以被称为多数党，是因为它控制着两院之一的半数以上席位。众议院议长和参议院多数党领袖，即多数党的国会领导人，拥有强大的权力来惩罚在特定投票中倒戈的党员。然而，当多数党的权力较为薄弱，而领导人需要所有成员团结一致时，这就使得个别议员或议员联盟处于有利地位。我们在众议院就看到了这种动态，极右翼共和党人组成的自由党团与两位众议院议长——凯文·麦卡锡和迈克·约翰逊——之间就存在这种动态。麦卡锡议长被罢免，而约翰逊议长在团结党内成员以通过预算和立法方面仍然面临挑战 。52
