On August 4, 2016, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe sued the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers seeking an injunction on the construction of a 1200-mile-long oil pipeline running through four states from North Dakota to Illinois. The tribe argued that building the pipeline near federally governed waters would harm important tribal cultural sites. Protests ensued, which grew in size and effectively blocked the pipeline company from completing its work. The company countersued the tribe. Numerous other actors became involved, including multiple federal judges, two presidents (Obama and Trump), and the governor, who called in the National Guard. While the initial outcome was that the pipeline was halted by the Obama administration, officials in the Trump administration quickly reactivated the project in early 2017. It was completed and is currently in operation. This scenario illustrates well the complexity of public policymaking as it actually occurs and how particular instances of policy can cut across many different domains, including, in this case, the environment, energy policy, tribal sovereignty, and transportation issues.

2016年8月4日，斯坦丁罗克苏族部落起诉美国陆军工程兵团，要求禁止修建一条长达1200英里、横跨四个州、从北达科他州延伸至伊利诺伊州的输油管道。该部落认为，在联邦管辖水域附近修建管道会破坏重要的部落文化遗址。随后爆发了抗议活动，规模不断扩大，最终有效地阻止了管道公司完成施工。该公司随后对部落提起反诉。众多其他各方也介入其中，包括多位联邦法官、两位总统（奥巴马和特朗普）以及州长（他甚至调动了国民警卫队）。虽然最初的结果是奥巴马政府叫停了该管道项目，但特朗普政府官员在2017年初迅速重启了该项目。最终，该管道建成并投入运营。这种情况很好地说明了公共政策制定在实际发生时的复杂性，以及具体的政策实例如何跨越许多不同的领域，包括本例中的环境、能源政策、部落主权和交通问题。

Each of the individual actors and institutions in the U.S. political system, such as the president, Congress, the courts, interest groups, and the media, gives us an idea of the component parts of the system and their functions. But in the study of public policy, we look at the larger picture and see all the parts working together to produce policy outcomes that ultimately affect citizens and their communities.

美国政治体系中的每个个体参与者和机构，例如总统、国会、法院、利益集团和媒体，都让我们对体系的组成部分及其功能有所了解。但在公共政策研究中，我们着眼于更宏观的层面，观察所有组成部分如何协同运作，最终产生影响公民及其社区的政策结果。

What is public policy? How do different areas of policy differ, and what roles do policy analysts and advocates play? What programs does the national government currently provide? And how do budgetary policy and politics operate? This chapter answers these questions and more.
