Figure D1 The number of Electoral College votes granted to each state equals the total number of representatives and senators that state has in the U.S. Congress or, in the case of Washington, DC, as many electors as it would have if it were a state. The number of representatives may fluctuate based on state population, which is determined every ten years by the U.S. Census, mandated by Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution. The most recent census was conducted in 2020.

图 D1 各州获得的选举人票数等于该州在美国国会的众议员和参议员总数；如果是华盛顿特区，则等于其作为州时所拥有的选举人票数。众议员人数可能根据各州人口数量而波动，人口数量由美国每十年一次的人口普查确定，这是美国宪法第一条第二款规定的。最近一次人口普查于 2020 年进行。
