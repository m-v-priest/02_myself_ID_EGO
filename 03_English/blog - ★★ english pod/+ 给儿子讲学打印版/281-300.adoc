Mr. Ford: Now, as we have already discussed there is a huge untapped market out there both in Asia, in other developing markets, and in the more mature markets for us to push into. Now of course, this represents an enormous challenge with enormous rewards for the winners, but for any new product we need a great marketing message and marketing campaign Mr. Ford: It needs to be directed and focused at our target consumer, and needs to be pitched at exactly the right level. The question we must first address is of course, who is our target consumer and secondly what do they expect from the next generation Alpha lap-top?  +
Mr. Ford: Let’s first of all tackle the first question. Our target consumer for the x420 is the middle class, white collar worker with an above average income. However, as we mentioned before the total number of computer owners is expanding rapidly and we need to broaden our audience for this product.  +
Mr. Ford: For example, the x420 is also ideally suited to the younger student sector, who might use laptops both for study and gaming. There is no doubt that. Audience Member: Mr. Ford, if I could just interrupt a moment. You say that the computer is suitable for students, but don’t you think the price of the x420 is just too much for most students? Mr Ford: Well, that’s a fair point. If you don’t mind I’d like to tackle your question a little bit later in the Q and A section. Is that okay? Audience Member: Yes sure. Mr Ford: Okay, so as I was saying we have an exciting campaign planned for the x420. Firstly, we will have a nationwide television campaign, as well as advertising on radio and also in many computer publications. We also intend to. Audience Member: I’m sorry to stop you Mr. Ford, but do you really think that a television campaign is cost effective. I mean, how much is that going to cost? Mr Ford: Well I don’t have the figures to hand, but I’d be happy to discuss those figures with you after the presentation. Okay let me just go on to talk a little more about the exciting campaign we have in store.  +

okay?

[.my2]
这是一个合理的观点。如果您不介意，我想稍后在问答环节再回答您的问题。这样可以吗？

Audience Member: Yes sure.

Mr Ford: Okay, so as I was saying we have
an exciting campaign planned for the x420.
Firstly, we will have a nationwide television
campaign, as well as advertising on radio

also intend 打算，想要 to...

[.my2]
正如我刚才所说，我们为x420策划了一个激动人心的营销活动。首先，我们将开展全国性的电视广告活动，同时在广播和许多计算机出版物上投放广告。我们还打算……

Audience Member: I’m sorry to stop you
Mr. Ford, but do you really think that a
television campaign is *cost effective* 有成本效益的；划算的. I mean,
how much is that going to cost?

[.my2]
但您真的认为电视广告具有"成本效益"吗？我的意思是，这会花费多少钱？

Mr Ford: Well I don’t have the figures 数据 to

A: We usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers.  +
B: Why? I mean, what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often?  +
A: First of all, we change the motor oil and oil filter. If you don’t do this, it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves.  +
B: I see. What else?  +
A: We also check your spark plugs, fuel filter, and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid. We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones.  +

-  tune up : /tuːn ʌp/ n. a series of adjustments made to a car’s engine to ensure it runs smoothly (调校).
====

B: Not that long ago 没那么久, I think it was four
months ago.

A: We usually recommend that you *bring*
your car *in* every five thousand kilometers.

B: Why? I mean, **what exactly do you do** to a
car that you need to check it so often?

A: First of all, we change the _motor oil_ 机油 and
_oil filter_ 油滤器. If you don’t do this, it can cause
your engine to wear (v.)磨损；消耗；用旧 faster and that means
you would probably have to change the
pistons 活塞 and _intake 摄入，吸入 valves_ (阀门；[解剖]瓣膜) 进气阀.

[.my2]
我们会更换"发动机油", 和"机油滤清器"。如果不这样做，可能会导致"发动机"磨损加快，这意味着您可能不得不更换"活塞"和"进气阀"。


[.my1]
.案例
====
- oil filter :  n. a device that removes impurities 杂质 from the engine oil (机油滤清器). 油滤器：一种设计用于**去除**发动机油、变速器油、润滑油, 或液压油中的**杂质**的过滤器

.intake valves
  /ˈɪn.teɪk vælvz/ n. components that control the flow of air and fuel into the engine (进气阀). +
进气门：内燃机中的一种阀门，用于控制空气和燃料混合物进入燃烧室。 +

image:../img/intake valves.jpg[,15%]

image:../img/diesel-engine-sequence-fuel-intake-valve-cycle.webp[,80%]

进气门，也就是intake valves，是发动机内部非常关键的小部件。想象一下，发动机就像一个不断重复呼吸的强力机器。进气门就是这个机器的“鼻孔”或“嘴”，负责在发动机运行时“吸气”。

当发动机启动后，每个气缸都会经历一系列的步骤，其中一个是“进气行程”。在这个时候，进气门会按照精确的时间打开，允许空气（在汽油发动机中，通常是空气和汽油混合物）进入气缸。这个过程就像是你深呼吸时鼻子和嘴巴张开，让新鲜空气进入肺部一样。

进气门的大小、开启和关闭的时机（这通常由凸轮轴控制）对发动机的性能至关重要。它们确保在正确的时间有足够的混合气进入，从而让发动机能够高效地做工，推动汽车前进。一旦气缸完成了做工，进气门会关闭，准备下一次的进气，整个过程循环往复，让发动机持续运转。所以，可以说进气门是发动机高效工作的起点。

====

B: I see. What else?

A: We also check your _spark plugs_ 火花塞, fuel filter 燃油滤清器,
and other oil levels such as *hydraulic （通过水管等）液压的，水力的 fluid* 液压油.
We also check the clutch  离合器踏板 and brakes to
determine when you will need new ones.

[.my2]
我们还会检查火花塞、燃油滤清器, 以及其他油液，比如液压油。我们还会检查离合器和刹车，以确定您何时需要更换新的。

Hello everyone my name is Laurie and I want to welcome you to this course. We will learn all about one of the oldest yet most delicious foods on this planet; cheese! Let’s get started!  +
 +
A:  +
Cheese is usually categorized intofour types: soft, semi-soft semi-hard and hard. The designation refers to the amount of moisture in the cheese, which directly affects its texture. Making cheese is an ancient practice, dating back thousands of years, and the home cheese maker can usually find recipes for cheese that falls into any of the four categories.  +
 +
A:  +
Soft cheese includes cottage cheese, cream cheese, ricotta, brie, bleu, roquefort, mozzarella, meunster and similar cheeses. These cheeses generally pair well with fruit or meats, or can be used as breakfast cheeses in an omelette Nor as pasta fillings. They are usually mildly flavored and very high in moisture.  +
 +
A:  +
American, Colby, co-jack and similar cheeses are inthe semi-soft category. These are slightly stronger in flavor and cover a  +
 +
 +
wide range of uses. Co-jack cheese, a blend of Colby and Monterrey jack is one of the most popular. This allows the sharper flavor of Colby to be combined with the milder jack cheese, and also melts better than plain Colby. Grilled cheese sandwiches often use American cheese, and Mexican cheeses such as Asadero and Queso Fresco are becoming more popular.  +
A: Hard cheeses include Parmesan, Romano, Asiago, Swiss, Gruyere and others. Parmesan and Romano are most familiar as the grated powder used to top spaghetti, but they are also used as accompaniments for fruit, wine, nuts and other appetizer items. Swiss is a popular sandwich cheese and melts well, unlike some other hard cheeses.  +

A：大家好，我叫劳里，欢迎参加本课程。我们将学习地球上最古老且最美味的食物之一——奶酪！让我们开始吧！ +
A：奶酪通常分为四类：软奶酪、半软奶酪、半硬奶酪和硬奶酪。这种分类是根据奶酪中的水分含量来划分的，水分直接影响奶酪的质地。制作奶酪是一种古老的实践，可以追溯到几千年前，家庭奶酪制作者通常可以找到适用于这四类奶酪的食谱。 +
A：软奶酪包括乡村奶酪、奶油奶酪、意大利乳清干酪、布里奶酪、蓝纹奶酪、罗克福尔奶酪、马苏里拉奶酪、明斯特奶酪等。这些奶酪通常与水果或肉类搭配得很好，或者可以作为早餐奶酪用于煎蛋卷或意大利面馅料。它们通常味道温和，水分含量很高。 +
A：美国奶酪、科尔比奶酪、科尔比杰克奶酪等属于半软奶酪。这些奶酪味道稍浓，用途广泛。科尔比杰克奶酪是科尔比奶酪和蒙特雷杰克奶酪的混合，是最受欢迎的奶酪之一。它将科尔比奶酪更浓烈的味道与较温和的杰克奶酪结合在一起，而且比纯科尔比奶酪更容易融化。烤奶酪三明治通常使用美国奶酪，而墨西哥奶酪如阿萨德罗奶酪和新鲜奶酪也越来越受欢迎。 +
A：硬奶酪包括帕尔马干酪、罗马诺奶酪、阿齐亚戈奶酪、瑞士奶酪、格鲁耶尔奶酪等。帕尔马干酪和罗马诺奶酪最常见的用途是作为磨碎的粉末撒在意大利面上，但它们也可以作为水果、葡萄酒、坚果和其他开胃菜的配菜。瑞士奶酪是一种流行的三明治奶酪，而且容易融化，不像其他一些硬奶酪。 +

Mr. Ford: Right everyone. I apologize that I can’t show you the marketing campaign today, but next week you will all have the opportunity to see if for yourselves, and I have no doubt that you will be impressed. Let me wrap up the presentation by summarising my key points.  +
 +
Mr. Ford: As I mentioned at the outset, 2010 represents a key year for Alpha computers. The recession is hopefully behind us. It is clear to everyone in the computer industry that demand is booming, especially in the developing markets.  +
Mr. Ford: If we are to succeed in this ultracompetitive field then we really need to push forward and offer our customers products that meet their needs on all levels. As I hope I have illustrated, the x420 represents the kind of computer that can really satisfy those needs.  +
Mr. Ford: I gave you an idea of the kind of revenue we expect to hit in 2010 with the new x420 range, and believe me, this is really just the beginning. Once we establish the x420 in the market we have plans to continue to expand our range with ever more revolutionary and impressive products. Mr. Ford: Alpha computers is dedicated to innovation and improvement. I really see no limit to our potential as long as we stick to the principles I stressed earlier: quality, excellence and service. Mr. Ford: Before we move on to the Q and A section I’d really like to leave you with a quote that really sums up everything that we’ve discussed today, and hopefully it will provide you with the same inspiration that it gives me. Mr. Ford: As the great Henry Ford once said ” Quality means doing it right, when no one is looking” Well, in fact our customers are looking; they are looking for us to lead the way and to give them the quality that our competitors cannot. We cannot let them down!  +

Mr. Ford: As the great Henry Ford once said, “Quality means (v.) doing it right, when no one is looking 注意.” Well, in fact our customers are looking; they are looking for us to  lead (v.) the way 引领方向 /and to give them the quality that our  competitors 竞争对手 cannot. We cannot  *let them down* 让他们失望!

福特先生：Alpha电脑致力于创新和改进。只要我们坚持我之前强调的原则——质量、卓越和服务，我认为我们的潜力是无限的。 +
