A: I called this meeting today in order to discuss our manufacturing plan. As I’m sure you’re all aware, with the credit crunch, and the global financial crisis, we’re obligated to look for more cost efficient ways of producing our goods. We don’t want to have to be looking at redundancies. So, we’ve outlined a brief plan to implement the just-in-time philosophy.  +
B: We have two basic points that we want to focus on. First of all, we want to reduce our lead time.  +
C: Why would want to do that? I think this is not an area that really needs to be worked on.  +
B: Well, we want to reduce production and delivery lead timesfor better overall efficiency.  +
A: Right, production lead times can be reduced by moving work stations closer together, reducing queue length, like for example, reducing the number of jobs waiting to be processed at a given machine, and improving the coordination and cooperation between successive processes. Delivery lead times can be reduced through close cooperation with suppliers, possibly by inducing suppliers to locate closer to the factory or working with a faster shipping company.  +
C: I see& That makes sense.  +
B: The second point is that we want to require supplier quality assurance and implement a zero defects quality program. We currently have far too many errors that lead to defective items and therefore, they must be eliminated. A quality control at the source program must be implemented to give workers the personal responsibility for the quality of the work they do, and the authority to stop production when something goes wrong.  +
C: I’m with you on this one. It’s essential that we reduce these errors; we’ve got to force our suppliers to reduce their mistakes.  +
A: Exactly. Well, let’s look at how we’re going to put this plan into action. First...(fade out)  +

.We don’t want to have to *be looking at* redundancies.
进行时态（"be looking at"）突出了动作正在进行, 或者可能**"在未来某一段时间持续进行"的可能性。**在这个上下文中，"be looking at redundancies" 表示他们不希望进入“不得不认真考虑裁员”的状态，强调一种不愿进入的长期情境或过程。

如果改成
"We don’t want to have to *look at* redundancies": +
"look at redundancies" 会显得更为果断，强调"**立即需要**进行裁员"的可能性。 +
“我们不希望不得不考虑裁员。”
这听起来更明确，可能让语气显得更为严肃和紧迫。

总结: +

"be looking at"	更柔和，强调一种可能会持续的状态或情境，适合表示希望避免进入这种阶段。 +
"look at"	更直接，强调裁员这个动作本身，语气更果断，听起来更紧迫。

B: #We have two _basic points_ that we want to
focus on.# First of all, we want to reduce our
_lead time_ 订货交付时间.

[.my2]
我们有两个基本点要重点关注。首先，我们想缩短交货时间。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Lead Time
前置时间（Lead time）是供应链管理中的一个术语，*是指从"采购方"开始下单订购, 到"供应商"交货, 所间隔的时间*，通常以天数或小时计算。

image:../img/Customer-Lead-Time.png[,100%]
====


C: #Why would want to do that# 为什么要这么做? I think this is
not an area that really needs *to be worked on* 努力改善（或完成）.

B: Well, we want to reduce (v.) _production and
delivery_ _lead times_ 前置时间 for better overall
efficiency 效率，效能.

[.my1]
.案例
====
.lead times

N-COUNTLead time is the time *between* the original design or idea for a particular product *and* its actual production. 从最初设计到投产的时间 +
N-COUNTLead time is the period of time that it takes for goods to be delivered after someone has ordered them. 从订货到交货的时间

**前置时间：指的是一个过程, 从"发起"到"执行完毕"之间, 间隔的时间。**比方说，一辆新汽车从"下订单", 到"生产完毕, 开始运送"之间, 需要花费的"前置时间", 无论如何都大概需要两周到六个月时间。在制造业，缩短前置时间, 是精益生产中较为重要的一环。

image:img/lead times.webp[,80%]

image:img/lead times 2.webp[,60%]


====

[.my2]
我们想缩短生产和交货时间，以提高整体效率。

A: Right, production _lead times_ can be
reduced by *moving* work stations *closer
together*, reducing queue （人、汽车等的）队，行列 length, like for
example, reducing the number of jobs
waiting to be processed at a given machine,
and improving _the coordination 协作；协调；配合 and
cooperation_ 合作；协作 between _successive (a.)连续的；接连的；相继的 processes_. +
Delivery _lead times_ can be reduced ① through
_close cooperation_ 密切合作 with suppliers, ② possibly by
inducing (v.)劝说，诱使 suppliers *to locate (v.) closer to* the
factory /or *working with* a faster shipping
company.

[.my2]
是的，生产提前期可以通过将工作站移得更近，减少队列长度，例如，减少在给定机器上等待处理的工作数量，以及改善连续过程之间的协调和合作来缩短。交货提前期可以通过与供应商的密切合作来缩短，可能是通过诱导供应商靠近工厂, 或与更快的运输公司合作。



C: I see 我明白了 & That makes sense 有意义;讲得通；有道理.

B: The second point is that we want to
require (v.)需要；要求做（某事），规定 supplier _quality assurance_ 质量保证 /and
implement (v.) a _zero defects 缺点，缺陷，毛病 quality program_.
#We currently have _far too many_ errors# that
*lead to* defective (a.)有缺点的；有缺陷的；有毛病的 items /and therefore, they
must be eliminated 被淘汰；消除；排除. A _quality control_ at _the
source program_ must be implemented /① to
give workers _the personal responsibility_ for
the quality of the work they do, ② and _the
authority 权；职权 to stop production_ when something
goes wrong.

[.my2]
第二点是, 我们希望要求供应商提供"质量保证", 并实施"零缺陷质量计划"。我们目前有太多的错误导致有缺陷的产品，因此，它们必须被消除。必须实施源程序的质量控制，使工人对他们所做的工作的质量负责，并在出现问题时, 有权停止生产。

C: #I’m with you /on this one.# #It’s essential 必不可少的，非常重要的
that# we reduce these errors; #we’ve got to 不得不，必须
force# (v.) our suppliers to reduce their mistakes.

[.my2]
这一点我同意你的看法。我们必须减少这些错误；我们必须迫使我们的供应商减少错误。

A: Exactly. Well, let’s look at how we’re going
to put this plan into action. First...(fade out)

[.my2]
没错。好吧，让我们来看看我们将如何把这个计划付诸实施。首先……（淡出）

这种重复强调, 常用于日常对话中，当对方可能没有完全接受你的第一次的拒绝时，你可以通过 "No really" 来更坚定地说明情况，这能通常带有一种礼貌或友好的语气，不至于显得生硬或冷淡。
