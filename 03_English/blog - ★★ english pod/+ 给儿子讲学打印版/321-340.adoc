.案例
====
- "*Speak again soon* I hope" 并不是倒装句。在这里，“I hope”是一个插入语，用来表达说话者的愿望或期待。正常语序也可以表达为 "I hope we can speak again soon." 但日常口语中，人们可能会把这种表达方式稍微调整，使其听起来更加自然或非正式。这种用法更贴近于口语的流畅性和情感的直接表达，而不是语法上的倒装结构。

这里发生了以下变化： +
省略了 "that"： 在正式的英语中，"I hope (that) we..."，但口语中 "that" 经常被省略。 +
语序颠倒： "Speak again soon" 被提前，"I hope" 放在了后面。

虽然它不是严格意义上的语法倒装（如疑问句中的倒装），但它确实改变了正常的语序，以达到特定的表达效果。它是一种口语中常见的表达方式，带有希望的语气。
====

Michelle: For sure. Take care.

== ■(337) Global View - The Night Before Christmas (C0337)  +
It was the night before Christmas, when all through the house Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse; The stockings were hung bythe chimney with care, In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there; The children were nestled all snug in their beds,  +
 +
And mama in her ’kerchief, and I in my cap,  +
Had just settled down for a long winter’s nap,  +
When out on the lawn there arose such a  +
clatter, I sprang from the bed to see what  +
was the matter.  +
Away to the window I flew like a flash, Tore  +
open the shutters and threw up the sash.  +
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen  +
snow  +
Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below,  +
When, what to my wondering eyes should  +
appear,  +
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny  +
reindeer,  +
With a little old driver, so lively and quick,  +
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.  +
More rapid than eagles his coursers they  +
came,  +
And he whistled, and shouted, and called  +
them by name;  +
” Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer  +
and Vixen!  +
On, Comet! on Cupid! on, Donder and  +
Blitzen!  +
To the top of the porch! to the top of the  +
wall!  +
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!  +
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane  +
fly,  +
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to  +
the sky, So up to the house-top the coursers  +
they flew,  +
With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas  +
too.  +
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof.  +
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.  +
As I drew in my head, and was turning  +
around,  +
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a  +
bound.  +
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to  +
his foot,  +
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes  +
and soot;  +
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,  +
And he looked like a peddler just opening his  +
pack.  +
His eyes – how they twinkled! his dimples  +
 +
how merry!  +
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a  +
cherry!  +
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a  +
bow,  +
Andthe beard of his chin was as white as the  +
snow;  +
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his  +
teeth,  +
Andthe smoke it encircled his head like a  +
wreath;  +
He had a broad face and a little round belly,  +
That shook, when he laughed like a bowlful  +
of jelly.  +
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old  +
elf,  +
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of  +
myself;  +
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,  +
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to  +
dread;  +
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his  +
work,  +
And filled allthe thestockings; then turned  +
with a jerk,  +
And laying his finger aside of his nose,  +
And giving a nod, upthe chimney he rose;  +
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a  +
whistle,  +
And away they all flew like the down of a  +
thistle.  +
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of  +
sight,  +
” Christmas to all, and to all a good-night.  +
 +
 +

这是《圣诞前夜》（A Visit from St. Nicholas）的经典诗歌，以下是它的中文翻译：

圣诞前夜，万籁俱寂， +
屋里屋外，悄无声息； +
长袜高悬，炉火旁， +
盼望圣尼古，降临此方； +
孩子们安睡，梦正酣， +
妈妈头巾裹，我帽遮颜， +
冬夜长眠，刚入梦乡， +
院中忽闻，声响异常。 +
我急忙起身，探头张望， +
飞身窗前，如电光， +
推开百叶，掀起窗框。 +
新雪映月，银光闪亮， +
地上万物，如白昼晃荡， +
我惊奇地，睁大眼眶， +
一辆小雪橇，八只驯鹿降， +
驾车老翁，敏捷又欢畅， +
瞬间明了，圣尼古降临此方。 +
骏马疾驰，胜过雄鹰翱翔， +
他吹口哨，高声呼唤， +
“驾，猛冲！驾，舞者！驾，跳跃和妖狐！ +
驾，彗星！驾，丘比特！驾，雷霆和闪电！ +
冲上门廊顶！冲上墙头！ +
冲啊！冲啊！冲啊！全都冲啊！” +
如狂风卷落叶，腾空而上， +
遇阻碍物，直冲云霄， +
骏马飞跃，直达屋顶， +
雪橇满载玩具，圣尼古同临。 +
转瞬之间，屋顶声响， +
小蹄哒哒，踏步轻扬。 +
我缩回脑袋，转身张望， +
圣尼古，从烟囱纵身下降。 +
他身披皮裘，从头到脚， +
衣衫沾满，灰烬与煤焦； +
玩具一包，背上斜靠， +
宛如小贩，刚把包打开。 +
双眼闪烁，酒窝欢笑！ +
脸颊如玫瑰，鼻头似樱桃！ +
嘴角微翘，如弓弦， +
胡须洁白，如雪团。 +
烟斗紧咬，齿缝间， +
烟雾缭绕，头顶光环； +
脸庞宽阔，肚腩圆， +
笑声震颤，如一碗果冻颤。 +
他矮胖可爱，真是老顽童， +
我忍俊不禁，笑出声容； +
他眨眨眼，歪歪头， +
让我明白，无需担忧； +
他一言不发，径直工作， +
长袜装满，转身利落， +
手指轻点，鼻旁一靠， +
点头示意，烟囱里升。 +
他跃上雪橇，口哨一啸， +
驯鹿飞驰，如蓟草轻飘。 +
他高声喊道，消失在远方， +
“圣诞快乐，祝大家晚安！” +
