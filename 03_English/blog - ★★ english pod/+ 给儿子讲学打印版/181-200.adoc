==== ◆(181) Elementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ Christmas Day (C0181)


A: Dad, dad, dad! Wake up! It’s Christmas!

B: Timmy. It’s too early for this. Look, it’s six
in the morning! Go back to bed!

[.my1]
.案例
====
- too early for this (phrase) 太早做某事。
====

A: No way 绝不,才不要! Santa already came and left all
our presents! Can we go open them 我们能去打开它们吗？? Please!
Please!

C: Of course we can honey 亲爱的. Bill, come on, get
dressed 穿上衣服.

[.my1]
.案例
====
- honey (n.) （昵称）亲爱的，用于家庭成员之间。
====


B: Fine! Not like Santa brought me any gifts!

[.my2]
好吧！反正圣诞老人也没给我带什么礼物！

[.my1]
.案例
====
在“Fine! *Not like* Santa brought me any gifts!”这句话中，*“not like”表达的是一种轻蔑或讽刺的语气*，大致可以理解为：
“又不是说”,
“好像”,
“*才不是*”,
“并不是”,
具体来说，这句话的意思是：

说话者感到不满或失望，因为他们没有收到礼物。
他们用讽刺的语气说，好像（或才不是）圣诞老人给他们带来了任何礼物。

因此，这句话的整体情绪是： +
一种被忽视或被遗忘的感觉。 +
一种带有讽刺意味的抱怨。 +

因此，根据语境，这句话的更贴切的中文翻译可以为： +
“好吧！又不是说圣诞老人给我带了什么礼物！” +
“哼！好像圣诞老人给我送过礼物似的！” +
“切！并不是圣诞老人给我送礼物了！”

"not like" 这个短语在英语口语中比较常见，用来表达轻蔑、讽刺、惊讶等语气。以下是一些例子，以及它们的解释：

[.my3]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|Header 1 |Header 2

|1.表示“又不是说”、“好像”：
|- "*Not like* I care." (又不是说我在乎。)
这句话表达了说话者明明在乎，却故意装作不在乎的讽刺语气。
- "*Not like* you'd understand." (好像你能理解似的。)
这句话表示说话者认为对方无法理解自己，带有轻蔑的意味。
- "Not like I asked for your opinion." (又不是说我征求你的意见。)
这句话用于反驳对方的意见，表示对方多管闲事。

|2.表示“不像”、“不是”：
|- "It's not like him to be late." (他不像会迟到的人。)
这句话表示某人的行为与平时不同，感到惊讶或疑惑。
- "*It's not like* we have a choice." (又不是说我们有选择。)
表示没有选择的，无奈的心情。

|3.表示“才不是”：
|- “*Not like* that's going to happen.”（才不会发生那样的事。）
表示不相信某件事会发生。
|===


总结：
*"not like" 的用法比较灵活，可以根据语境表达不同的语气。
它通常带有一定的负面情绪，如不满、讽刺、轻蔑等。*
在口语中使用较多，正式场合较少使用。

需要注意的是：
*"not like" 的具体含义需要结合上下文来判断。
在不同的语境中，它的语气可能会有所不同。*

第一句 表示 “这是你能给中国炒菜最严重的侮辱”（形容炒菜做得很糟糕）。 +
第二句 是一个感叹句，意思是 “这对她用的锅来说，简直是种耻辱！”（暗示菜做得太差，连锅都蒙羞了）。
