Good evening, my fellow Americans. Three days from now, after a half-century of service of our country, I shall lay down the responsibilities of office as, in a traditional and solemn ceremony, the authority of the Presidency is vested in my successor. This evening I come to you with a message of leave-taking and farewell, and to share a few final thoughts with you, my countrymen.  +

Like every other citizen, I wish the new President, and all who will labor with him, Godspeed. I pray that the coming years will be blessed with peace and prosperity for all.  +

Our people expect their President and the Congress to find essential agreement on questions of great importance, the wise resolution of which will better shape the future of our great nation. My own relations with Congress began on a remote and tenuous basis when, long ago, a member of the Senate appointed me to West Point. I then had the pleasure of building more intimate relationship with Congress during the war and immediate post-war period. Finally, we have progressed to the mutually interdependent relationship we’ve had during these past eight years.  +

|A: Good evening, my fellow (a.)同类的，同伴的 Americans.
Three days from now, after a half-century of
service of our country, I shall *lay down* 放下 the
responsibilities of office #as# 当……的时候(这里用 "as" 表示"卸任的时刻"与"权力交接仪式"同时发生), in a traditional
and solemn (a.)（仪式）庄严的，隆重的 ceremony, #the authority# 当局；官方；当权者 of the
Presidency is vested (v.)授予，赋予，给予（权利或责任） in my successor. This

|晚上好，我的美国同胞们。三天后，在为国效力半个世纪之际，我将在传统而庄严的仪式中, 将总统职权移交给继任者，卸下公职责任。今晚，我带着告别信息来到你们面前，向你们——我的同胞们——分享最后的几点感想。

- leave-taking：正式告别（文学用语，比 goodbye 更庄重）
- countrymen：同胞（现多改用 fellow citizens 以体现性别中立）

|A: Like every other citizen, I wish the new
President, and all who will labor (v.)劳动；努力；苦干 with him,
Godspeed (n.)祝成功. I pray that the coming years will
*be blessed (v.)求上帝降福于；祝福 with* 赋有（能力等）；享有（幸福等） _peace_ and _prosperity_ for all.

|如同所有公民一样，我祝愿新总统及所有与他共事者, 诸事顺遂。我祈祷未来岁月, 将赐予所有人和平与繁荣。

- 刻意强调"like every other citizen"，凸显卸任后回归平民身份

|A: Our people expect their President and the
Congress  国会 to find _essential agreement_ on
questions of great importance, `主` the wise
resolution of which `谓` will better shape (v.) the
future of our great nation.

`主` My own relations
with Congress `谓` began (v.) on _a remote and
tenuous 脆弱的；微弱的；缥缈的;纤细的；薄的；易断的 basis_ 原因；缘由;基础；要素；基点 when, long ago, a member of

the war and immediate post-war period.
Finally, we have progressed (v.)进步；改进；进展 to the mutually
_interdependent 相互依赖的；互助的 relationship_ we’ve had during
these past eight years.

|我们的人民期待总统与国会在重大问题上达成基本共识，这些问题的明智解决, 将更好地塑造我们伟大国家的未来。 +
我本人与国会的关系始于遥远而脆弱的起点——很久以前，一位参议员任命我进入西点军校。后来在战争期间及战后初期，我有幸与国会建立了更紧密的关系。最终，在过去的八年里，我们发展出了相互依存的关系。

A: Okay, next question. If Eric *asked you out* 约某人出去（特指约会邀请）
on a date 约会，幽会, what would you say?

B: Duh 表明显易见（俚语，带轻微不耐烦，如“这还用问？”）! I would say yes! Eric is the most
popular kid in school! Okay, my turn. What
would you do if you won the lottery 抽彩给奖法;中彩票（虚拟语气标志词，实际可能性极低）?

[.my2]
好，下一题。如果埃里克约你出去，你会怎么说？ +
废话！当然答应！埃里克可是全校风云人物！该我了，你要是中彩票会干嘛？



A: Let’s see.... If I won the lottery, I would
buy two tickets for a trip around the world.

B: If you buy me a ticket I will go with you
for sure!

[.my2]
我想想……要是中奖了，我会买两张环球旅行的票。 +
要是你给我买票，我绝对跟你去！

[.my1]
.案例
====
- If I #won# the lottery, I #would# buy two tickets for a trip around the world.  +
虚拟语气一致性：从句（won）与主句（would buy）时态匹配
====

A: My dad will *freak （使）吃惊，不安，恼怒 out* 抓狂,暴怒 if I even mention a
trip like that!


B: Alright this is _a good one_ 劲爆问题（指难以回答或敏感话题）. What would
your mom say if you told her you are going
to get married?


[.my2]
我光是提这种旅行，我爸就得抓狂！ +
来个猛的——要是告诉你妈你要结婚，她会咋说？

[.my1]
.案例
====
- What #would#
your mom say #if# you #told# her you are going
to get married? +
虚拟语气混合：从句用过去式（told），主句用would say，但内嵌现在进行时（are going to）体现即时性
====

A: If I told her that, she would faint (v.)昏厥 and
have me committed （下令）把（某人）送进（医院或监狱等）!

[.my2]
她得当场晕倒，然后把我送进精神病院！

[.my1]
.案例
====
- commit :
(v.) [ often passive]**~ sb to sth** : to order sb to be sent to a hospital, prison, etc.（下令）把（某人）送进（医院或监狱等） +
-She was committed to a psychiatric hospital.她被送进了精神病院。

- have me committed：强制送入精神病院（commit的被动语态，口语中夸张用法）. +
用极端后果（进精神病院）表达母亲会认为结婚想法荒唐. +
这里的 “have me committed” 是一个口语表达，意思是“把我送进精神病院”, 或者“让我接受精神病治疗”。说话者用这种夸张的说法，表示如果他告诉母亲他要结婚，母亲会极度震惊，甚至觉得他精神有问题，需要被送进医院接受治疗。

which will be good for our business!

[.my2]
听说了吗？州政府正考虑在我们城市将赌博合法化！很快我们就会有超棒的酒店和赌场，这对我们的生意有利！


B: Are you serious? Gambling is a vice （与性或毒品有关的）罪行

B: Well, *to begin with* 首先（列举论点常用短语）, Gambling is addictive 使人成瘾的,

addicted *it is very difficult* to stop. People

[.my2]
首先，赌博具有成瘾性，会毁掉婚姻、破坏家庭、使社区破产。一旦上瘾就很难戒除。有人因此失去房子车子，上瘾后流落街头。 +
其次，它的剥削性体现在：男性常因刺激和风险上瘾，女性为逃避现实赌博，老年人为了社交开始赌博。未成年赌徒常从和朋友体育赌博开始，然后找非法庄家。

- "the action" 这里指赌博带来的刺激（特定语境义）
- "illegal bookies" 非法庄家（bookie=bookmaker的俚语）

Although 但是，然而, I have been to Las Vegas, and I
didn’t become addicted or anything like that.

天！这么一说，合法化赌博可能不是好主意！不过我去过拉斯维加斯也没上瘾啊。

Man: Hi, I made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle. The name is Jimmy Fox. Agent: I’m sorry, we have no mid-size available at the moment. Man: I don’t understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation? Agent: Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of cars. Man: But the reservation keeps the car here. That’s why you have the reservation. Agent: I know why we have reservations. Man: I don’t think you do. If you did, I’d have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don’t know how to hold the reservation and that’s really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them. Agent: But we do have a compact or an SUV if you’d like. Man: Fine. I’ll take the compact. Agent: Alright. We have a blue Ford Focus for you Mr. Fox. Would you like insurance? Man: Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car.  +

Daddy: Bobby! Come here, look what I got you! Bobby: What is that? Daddy: A chess board! Daddy is going to teach you how to play! Bobby: Cool! Daddy: Ok, each player gets 16 pieces. You can be the white ones and I’ll play with the black pieces. Now in the front, you set up the pawns. Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward. When you are about to capture another piece, it can move one space diagonally. Bobby: What about all these other pieces? Daddy: See this one that looks like a tower? It’s called the rook. The one with the tall hat is called the bishop. See this little horsey? This is called the knight, it’s a very important piece so it’s best to not let your opponent capture it. Bobby: And these two? They are husband and wife? Daddy: That’s right! That’s the queen and that’s the king. If the other player captures your king, he will say ”Check Mate” and the game is over! Doesn’t this sound fun? Bobby: Nah! This is boring! I’m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation!  +
