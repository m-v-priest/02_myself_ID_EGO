==== ◆(221) Elementary ‐Daily Life ‐ Car Trouble 汽车故障 (C0221)

A: Car trouble center. How may I help you?

B: My car won’t start! Stupid old car!

A: Hold on, before you kick your car let’s *go
through* 检查 some possible problems.

B: Fine.

A: Ok, first of all, can you turn the key in the
ignition  着火，点燃；点火装置，点火开关?

[.my2]
您能转动点火开关的钥匙吗？

B: Yeah! I am here with my friend and he
thinks it may be the _spark 火花，火星 plug_ 火花塞 or the _starter
motor_ 启动马达.

[.my2]
他认为可能是火花塞或启动马达的问题。

[.my1]

A: Those are possible problems, but tell me,
when you turn the key, do you hear the
_starter motor_ 启动马达  crank  (v.)转动（内燃机的）曲轴?

B: Yeah, it sounds like it usually does when I
start the car, but nothing else happens. The
engine won’t start. Should I maybe press (v.) the
accelerator 油门；催化剂；[机] 加速装置?

[.my2]
能，听起来就像平时启动车时的声音，但其他什么也没发生。发动机就是发动不了。我是不是该踩油门？

A: No. If you step on the _accelerator pedal_ 油门踏板
you can flood the carburetor 汽化器；化油器 and your car will
never start.

[.my2]
不要。如果您踩油门，可能会淹没化油器，您的车就永远发动不了了。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.carburetor
-> 来自词根carb, 碳。-ure, 名词后缀。-etor, 名词后缀。

化油器(Carburetor)是一種把燃料混入空氣的裝置。

為什麼引擎要在燃燒前, 把"燃料"和"空氣"預先混合好呢？**要燃料完全在氣缸中燃燒，就必須想辦法加大表面積。如果可以把燃料化作霧氣一般，每一小滴的燃料四週, 就會有非常充足的空氣, 可以提供燃燒時需要的氧氣，有接近無限大的表面積。**那么有沒有方法可以不間斷地將燃料化為霧氣？"化油器"就可以做到.

B: So what do you think it is?

A: I know this may seem like a silly 愚蠢的，傻的 question,
but does your car have gasoline 汽油?

B: Umm. yeah! Right! I got the car started 我把车发动起来了!
Thanks for your help! I told you to fill the
tank!

.案例

.mothball
樟脑丸的英文名字。其实，它叫mothball[ˋmɔθbɔl]。Moth这个词原本是“蛾”的意思，因为樟脑丸主要是用来防衣蛾的，所以在英文中用了这个字。不过，这里的樟脑是指从樟树中提取的物质。原本的樟脑丸应该是用天然樟树提取物制成的，但现在大部分便宜的樟脑丸都是化学合成的。

樟脑丸（英语：Mothball），又称卫生球、卫生丸、防蛀球、臭蛋、臭丸，*是一类用作杀虫剂、除臭剂的球状固体，主要用于防治衣物中的虫害（主要是衣蛾）和防霉。* 樟脑丸得名自"樟树"树干中含有的"樟脑"。

过去的卫生球使用易燃的"萘"(nài) 与"萘酚"，因此又称为萘丸；现在则大部分被对"二氯苯"所取代。

- 成人食入2克"樟脑"即可引发严重中毒，食入4克可致命。 +
- "萘"的致死剂量估计在1-2克左右。
- 对"二氯苯"的毒性较萘低，成人可以承受20克的口服剂量。美国卫生及公共服务部认为，*对"二氯苯"可以“合理推定为致癌物质”。*

image:../img/mothball.jpg[,15%]

另外，由于现在使用樟脑丸的人不多，这个词也被用来指那些已经收起来不用的东西。用法是bemothballed 或 be put into mothballs。


- The smell of mothballs is very pungent. (樟脑丸的味道很刺鼻。)
- The expensive blender （美）搅拌机；掺和者；混合物 I bought three years ago `谓` has been mothballed. (我三年前买的昂贵果汁机, 已经被束之高阁。)

.This here
这个：指代离说话者较近的某个物体或事物。

.slammer
-> 俚语，来自 slam,关门，猛关，猛摔。

A: Oh, George, what a beautiful day 美好的一天 it is today! The sun is hot  and there are just a few clouds  scattered 散落 here and there! What a perfect day to be at the beach 海滩! The kids are going to have so much fun 玩得开心! And we’ll be able to relax 放松 in the sun while they’re playing.

B: It does seem like the perfect day! I’m glad we chose to get out of the city 离开城市 and enjoy the nice weather 好天气! This *looks like* the perfect spot 地点! Ok kids, put on your sunscreen 防晒霜 while your mom and I set up camp 搭帐篷. Here, Mary, help me *lay down* 铺设 these beach towels 沙滩毛巾.

A: There we go 好了，就这样，就这么办. Can you help me with the umbrella 遮阳伞? Perfect.

B: Ok kids, here’s a beach ball 沙滩球 and a Frisbee 飞盘, a pail 桶 and a shovel 铲子. I want to see an impressive sandcastle 沙堡 by the time we leave. Don’t stray (v.)迷路；偏离；走失 too far 别走太远. Wait! Leave your sandals 凉鞋 here /or put on your _wet shoes_ 水鞋,湿鞋.

A: And stay in the shallow area 浅水区. I don’t want to see you go any farther *than* that sandbar 沙洲；沙堤! It’s too deep 深 out there /and we didn’t bring your floaties 浮水圈.

.It’s too deep out there
这个句子中，*"out" 用来表示方向或距离，强调“那片远一点的区域”比说话人所在的地方更远。*

比较 "It’s too deep out there" 和 "It’s too deep there"

[.my3]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|It’s too deep out there.|It’s too deep there.

|"out there" 表示远离说话人的某个地方，通常指水域、野外、开放空间等。 +
在这里，**"out" **让听者更清楚地知道危险的水域**是在远处，而不是当前站立的地方。** +
例如，你站在浅水区，指着**远处的**沙洲后面说：“那边水太深了。”
|*"there" 只是一个一般性的地点指示词，没有明确的方向或距离感。* +
听起来更像是“那里很深”，*但不一定强调它在远处。* +
|===

总结 +
- "It’s too deep out there." → 强调“远处”水太深，不要游过去（更自然、更符合语境）。 +
- "It’s too deep there." → 只是陈述某个地方很深，没有强调它在远处。
====

B: You’re back already? The water was too cold, huh? I’ll tell you a secret 秘密. Do you see that small _pool of water_ 水池 over there? It’ll be warmer in there. Go see if you can find some seashells 贝壳 or catch some minnows 小鱼；鲰.

A: 乔治，今天天气真好！阳光明媚，只有几朵云散落各处！去海滩再合适不过了！孩子们会玩得很开心！我们也能在他们玩耍时晒太阳放松。 +
B: 确实是个完美日子！很高兴我们离开城市来享受好天气！这地方真不错！孩子们，涂好防晒霜，我和妈妈搭帐篷。玛丽，帮我铺沙滩毛巾。 +
A: 好了，帮我弄下遮阳伞？完美。 +
B: 孩子们，这是沙滩球、飞盘、桶和铲子，走之前我要看到一座漂亮的沙堡！别走太远！等等！把凉鞋留这儿或穿上湿鞋。 +
A: 待在浅水区，别越过沙洲！那边水太深，我们没带浮水圈。 +
B: 这么快就回来了？水太冷了吧？告诉你个秘密，看到那边的小水池了吗？那里更暖和，去找贝壳或抓小鱼吧。 +
A: 那是什么？水母？杰里米，快放下！它会蜇你！ +
B: 啊！别蜇我！嗷！ +

[.my1]
.案例
====
这段对话最后, 为什么Alex 要说 Well, there’s that too.  ?

C试图轻松地解决Alex的睡眠问题，认为只是短暂的失眠，并建议使用褪黑素。
为了淡化问题的严重性，C说：“It’s not something freakish like if he was a sleepwalker.”（这不像他梦游那样怪异。）C用梦游来举例，说明Alex的问题不是什么严重的，怪异的，难以解决的问题。

Alex的回答“Well, there’s that too.”（嗯，还有那个。）是对C刚刚提到的梦游的回应。
这句话的隐含意思是：Alex实际上也有梦游的情况。
通过说“that too”，Alex承认梦游也是他睡眠问题的一部分。
这个"that"指代的就是C刚刚所说的 sleepwalker 梦游者.

Stephanie: It’s a skill. What can I say? I don’t know why, I just have a long routine. Jacob: Please explain because it makes no sense to me. How can a girl’s routine be so complicated? You get up, you shower, you get dressed , you brush your teeth, you’re out the door. Half an hour, tops.  +
Stephanie: Jacob, you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling. I don’t. I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings. Every day, I wake up and head straight for the shower. Every second day, I wash my hair. If it’s a hair-washing day, I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily. Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too. Because my hair is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes. Afterwards, I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew. I take a long time to get dressed in the morning. Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning. In all, getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair. From time to time I’ll put my hair up, but oftentimes I blowdry it straight. And then, because of the texture of my hair, I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing. That’s another twenty minutes or so. After that, I have my daily makeup routine. Jacob: True, I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on, even when you show up to class in sweatpants. Tell me, how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning?  +

“to flatiron”作为一个动词，表示“用电夹板拉直（头发）”。

虽然“flatiron”主要指用于头发的工具，但“flatiron”这个词本身也指“熨斗”。所以需要根据语境来判断。 +
“flatiron”也指，美国纽约市的“熨斗大厦”，因为建筑外形和熨斗很像。

Charles: Hi Cody, how did practicing go this
week?

[.my2]
这周的练习怎么样？

Cody: Well I had several tests and _an oral
presentation_ 陈述，报告，说明 this week /so I didn’t get a
chance to memorize (v.)记住，熟记 the second page, but I
think I mastered 精通，掌握 the tricky 难对付的，棘手的；狡猾的，诡计多端的 section.

[.my2]
我这周有好几场考试和一个口头报告，所以没机会背第二页，但我觉得我掌握了那个困难的部分。

Charles: Great! Warm up 热身 with some scales 音阶
and arpeggios  琶音，琶音和弦 first. Good, good. This week,
*work on* 努力改善（或完成） keep**ing** the rhythm 节奏，韵律，节拍 steady when
you play the last part with the sixteenth note 十六分音符
. Now let’s *take a look at* this tricky (a.)难对付的，棘手的；狡猾的，诡计多端的 section.

[.my2]
很好！先用一些音阶和琶音热身。很好，很好。这周，你在演奏最后部分时, 要努力保持节奏稳定，尤其是十六分音符的部分。现在让我们看看这个困难的部分。

[.my1]
.案例
====
- arpeggio : ( music 音)the notes of a chord played quickly one after the other琶音，琶音和弦（快速连续弹出和弦的音符） +
-> 来自意大利语。arp, 同harp, 竖琴。词根eg, 同ag, 做，弹奏。
====

Cody: Charles? Before I start /I was
wondering if it was ok /if I put a small
crescendo (n.)声音渐增;渐强 in here /*and then* decrescendo (n.)渐弱；渐弱音
*back to* pianissimo (a.)极轻柔的;极弱 *again* over here?

[.my2]
在我开始之前，我想知道如果我在这个地方加一个小小的渐强，然后在这里再渐弱回到极弱，可以吗？

[.my1]
.案例
====
- crescendo -> 来自PIE*ker , 创造，生长，词源同create。-esce, 表起始。用做音乐术语。
- pianissimo -> 来自pianus,弱的，异化自planus,平的，词源同plan,plain.-im,最高级后缀，词源同
====

Charles: It might work. I’ll have to hear it .
Show me what you’ve done. Not bad , not
bad .

[.my2]
可能行得通。我得听听看。给我看看你做了什么。不错，不错。

Cody: It was horrible! I played it much
better at home!

[.my2]
糟透了！我在家弹得好多了！

Charles: It’s just nerves.
Just play the _right hand_ 右手 for now. One two
three four five six, ta ti tri-ple-ti. Good, good.
Don’t forget the accidentals 临时变音记号；次要方面，非主要的特性! The _key
signature_ 音调符号 says that note 音，音符 should be a G-sharp (G升)
but now it’s a G-natural  (还原G). Now add the _bass (a.)低音的，低声调的
clef_ 谱号. You’re going too fast. Remember the
tempo （运动或活动的）速度，节奏 for *this piece （成套物品的）部件，部分；（艺术、音乐、戏剧、文学的）一部作品 is andante* (n.)行板；行板乐曲；徐缓调.

[.my2]
只是紧张而已。现在只弹右手。一二三四五六，嗒 嘀 嘀-嘀-嘀。很好，很好。别忘了临时变音记号！调号显示那个音应该是升G，但现在是还原G。现在加上低音谱号。你弹得太快了。记住这首曲子的速度是行板。

[.my1]
.案例
====
- clef
image:../img/clef.avif[,49%]


- andante : ( music 音) a piece of music to be played fairly slowly行板（速度稍缓）
====

Cody: Is that better?

[.my2]
这样好点了吗？

Charles: Yes, much better. Watch where you
*lift* (v.)提起，举起；抬起（身体某一部位） your foot *off* the pedal. What was that?

[.my2]
注意你抬脚离开踏板的位置。刚才那是什么？


Cody: Sorry! The stretch for that octave 八度音阶；八行诗 is
always hard to make.

[.my2]
那个八度的跨度, 总是很难弹到。

Charles: That’s ok, keep going, you’re
*moving ahead* 前进、取得进展 by _leaps  猛冲，突然而迅速地移动；剧增，猛涨 and bounds_ (跳跃；弹回) 巨大的改进或显著的进步. Watch
your dynamics 动力学，力学；动力；（乐曲的）力度变化! Keep your elbows  肘；弯头 lifted.
Remember (v.) to stroke the keys, don’t pound 连续重击，猛打.
That’s better! Remember that as a pianist or
any other musician 音乐家, your technique will be
_what *separates* (v.) you *from* the pack_ 一捆，一包（尤指适于携带的东西）;群；帮；团伙;（统称）竞赛中的落后者 just *as
much or more so as* 和…一样多或更多 your musicianship 音乐才能.

[.my2]
没关系，继续弹，你进步得很快。注意你的力度变化！保持肘部抬起。记住要轻触琴键，不要重击。这样好多了！记住，作为钢琴家或任何其他音乐家，你的技巧将是你脱颖而出的关键，甚至比你的音乐才能更重要。

 +
A:  +
Let’s start with the basics :bread. Bread is an important ingredient here. You need to remember one thing -choose the bread according to the following criteria :freshness, crumb and color. If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven, or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.  +

A:  +
Now that our bread is ready, let’s talk  +
 +
 +
 +
about the ingredients ! Of course, each person’s palate is different, but I’m going to give you a few tips that you’ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich. I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich.  +
A:  +
Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light. The best choices here are evident-cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper pepper or chilli, lettuce and, of course, herbs-you can’t go wrong with them. As for aubergines, mushrooms and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.  +
 +

.Sweet Pepper or Chili Pepper? Different Taste, Same Plant
甜椒还是辣椒？ 味道不同，但植物相同

even if most sweet peppers in the Western world have large cubic fruits (bell peppers) and most chili peppers, small conical ones, in fact, either can have fruits large or small, rounded, elongated, conical, cubic or completely irregular. Both too can come in a wide range of colors.

尽管西方世界的大多数甜椒都有大立方体果实（灯笼椒），而大多数辣椒都有小圆锥形果实，但**事实上，它们的果实既可以大也可以小，可以是圆形、细长形、圆锥形、立方体或完全不规则形。它们的颜色也多种多样。**


The real difference between chili and sweet peppers is therefore 因此，所以 found entirely in the taste: chili peppers contain (v.) capsaicin 辣椒素, a pungent 辛辣的；刺激性的 component that burns (v.) *not only* the tongue, *but even* the fingers (you have to wear (v.) latex (n.)乳胶；乳液 gloves when harvesting (v.) very hot peppers). Their burning taste is so overwhelming few people notice (v.) their underlying (a.) flavors.  +
Sweet peppers, on the other hand, contains (v.) no capsaicin or very, very little of it, so _richer, sweeter flavors_ *come to* the forefront 重要位置，最前沿；（思考、关注的）重心.

To measure the effect of capsaicin, _Scoville units_ are used. Sweet peppers usually contain (v.) 0 SHU (Scoville _heat units_ 热（量）单位), _banana peppers_ a bit more (100 to 500 SHU) while _Habanero peppers_, said to taste (v.) “very hot,” from 100,000 to 350,000 SHU …and pure capsaicin contains (v.) an incredible 16 million SHU!

因此，**"辣椒"和"甜椒"的真正区别完全在于味道： +
-> 辣椒含有"辣椒素"，这种辛辣成分不仅会灼伤舌头，甚至会灼伤手指（采摘非常辣的辣椒时必须戴上乳胶手套）。**它们的灼伤味非常强烈，以至于很少有人注意到它们的潜在味道。 +
-> 另一方面，**甜椒不含或含极少量辣椒素，因此更浓郁、更甜的味道会凸显出来。**为了衡量辣椒素的效果，使用斯科维尔单位。甜椒通常含有 0 SHU（"斯科维尔"辣度单位），香蕉椒的辣度稍高一些（100 至 500 SHU），而哈瓦那辣椒据称味道“非常辣”，辣度为 100,000 至 350,000 SHU……而纯辣椒素含有令人难以置信的 1600 万 SHU！

Peppers are tropical plants and therefore only in very mild climates could you consider sowing them directly outdoors. Elsewhere the growing season simply isn’t long enough or warm enough. Most of us will have to start ours indoors, normally about 9 weeks before the last frost date. You can sow peppers in plastic pots or cell packs, but since the roots are a bit fragile, peat pots are preferable.

**辣椒是热带植物，因此只有在气候非常温和的地方, 才可以考虑直接在"户外"播种。在其他地方，生长季节不够长，温度也不够高。我们大多数人必须在"室内"开始种植，**通常是在最后一次霜冻日期前 9 周左右。你可以在塑料盆或蜂窝袋中, 播种辣椒，但由于根部有点脆弱，泥炭盆是更好的选择。

.lettuce +
-> lettuce（莴苣）是一种十分常见的蔬菜，其茎部称为“莴笋”，叶子称为“生菜”。单词lettuce来自拉丁语lactuca，源自lactis（乳汁），同源词有lactate（分泌乳汁、喂奶）。莴苣之所以得此名，是因为莴苣茎部切开后，能分泌状如乳汁的白色汁液。 +

We can be subtle 巧妙的 and just add (a.) a touch of 一点点 salt 盐 and pepper 胡椒, or we can combine 结合 _mustard 芥末酱；芥末黄，深黄色 sauce_ 芥末酱, mayonnaise 蛋黄酱, ketchup 番茄酱 or even caviar 鱼子酱 to achieve (v.)达到 a stronger flavor 味道! It’s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles 三角形 or manageable 方便食用的 pieces 块 /to avoid 避免 all your ingredients *falling out* 掉落；脱落 and staining (v.)弄脏,沾染 your shirt!

A：让我们从基础知识开始：面包。面包是这里的重要配料。您需要记住一件事——根据以下标准选择面包：新鲜度、面包屑和颜色。如果您想要一个封闭的三明治，我建议您先在烤面包机或烤箱中烤面包，或者稍微烤一下，直到它变成浅棕色。 +

A：不要低估它们，因为它们在形成味道方面起着重要作用，并且会使三明治更加令人神清气爽和清淡。这里最好的选择是显而易见的——黄瓜、西红柿、洋葱、甜椒或辣椒、生菜，当然还有香草——您不会出错的。至于茄子、蘑菇和芦笋，我建议您先用少量橄榄油稍微烤一下。 +
A：最后但并非最不重要的一点是，我们可以为我们完美的三明治添加各种各样的调味品。我们可以巧妙地只添加一点盐和胡椒，或者我们可以结合芥末酱、蛋黄酱、番茄酱甚至鱼子酱，以达到更浓郁的味道！将您的三明治切成三角形或方便食用的块，以避免所有配料掉出来并弄脏您的衬衫，这始终是一个好主意！ +

 +
 +
 +
seriously, sexual education is very important and I want you to ask as many questions as you can think of. Remember, there are no stupid questions here.  +
B: Miss Carlton? What exactly is sexual education? Are you going to teach us like Kama sutra stuff like that?  +
A: No Jason, that’s not exactly what sex ed is. Basically, we will talk about sexually transmitted diseases, contraceptives and how the male and female bodies work.  +
B: My older sister is in college and she takes what she and her friends call the pill. I never really understood what that is, but I know it has to do with sex or something.  +
A: Good point Jason! This will be the topic of our first class, contraceptives. As you mentioned, the pill is one of the many that exist. The birth control pill is taken daily by a woman in order to prevent unwanted pregnancy, but it does not protect her from contracting STD’s from an infected person. Another popular method is using condoms. This is probably the best method if you have sex, since it not only prevents a woman from getting pregnant but also protects both from STD’s. Yes Jason?  +
B: What are condoms made out of? How exactly is it that a woman gets pregnant?  +

A: Now I want everyone to take this class seriously 认真对待, sexual education is very important /and I want you to ask *as many questions as you can think of*. Remember, there are no stupid questions here.

B: Miss Carlton? What exactly is sexual education? Are you going to teach us like _Kama sutra 卡玛苏特拉(关于性欲及其它主题的印度古书) stuff_ like that?

.案例

.Kama sutra
它既不是专门的性爱手册，也不是主要讲解性体位的性爱手册， 而是一本关于幸福生活艺术、爱的本质、寻找伴侣、维持性生活以及其他与享乐主义相关的方面的指南。 它是一部佛经体裁的经文.

Kamasutra acknowledges (v.)承认 the Hindu concept 概念，观念 of purusharthas, /and *lists* (v.) desire, sexuality 性征，性欲，性行为；性取向, and emotional fulfillment 履行；实行；满足（感） *as* one of the proper goals of life.  +
It discussed (v.) methods for courtship 求爱；求婚；求爱期, training in the arts to be socially engaging 善于社交的, finding a partner, flirting 打情骂俏；调情,玩弄；摆动, *maintaining (v.) power* in a married life, when and how *to commit (v.)做出（错或非法的事）；犯（罪或错等） adultery* 通奸(指已婚者与非配偶者发生性关系), sexual positions, and other topics.  +
The text majorly *dealt with* the philosophy and theory of love, what *triggers (v.) desire*, what *sustains (v.) it*, and how and when it is good or bad.

《爱经》承认印度教的“purusharthas”概念，并将欲望、性和情感满足, 列为人生的正确目标之一。它讨论了求爱的方法、社交技巧的训练、寻找伴侣、调情、在婚姻生活中保持权力、何时以及如何通奸、性姿势等话题。文本主要涉及爱情的哲学和理论，什么引发了欲望，什么维持了欲望，以及欲望如何以及何时是好是坏。

A: No Jason, that’s not exactly what sex ed is. Basically, we will talk about _sexually transmitted diseases_ 性传播疾病, contraceptives 避孕措施 and how the male and female bodies work (v.).

B: My older sister is in college /and she takes what she and her friends call the pill （女用）口服避孕药. I never really understood what that is, but I know /it has to do with sex or something.

A: Good point 好的观点、意见或信息 Jason! This will be the topic of our first class, contraceptives 避孕药. As you mentioned, the pill is one of the many that exist. The birth control pill 避孕药 is taken daily by a woman /*in order to* prevent unwanted pregnancy 意外怀孕, but it does not protect her from contracting (v.)感染（疾病） STD’s 感染性传播疾病 from an infected (a.)（身体部位或伤口）受感染的 person. Another popular method is using (v.) condoms 避孕套. This is probably the best method if you have sex, since it *not only* prevents a woman from getting pregnant /*but also* protects both from STD’s. Yes Jason?

B: What are condoms *made out of* 由……制成? How exactly is it that a woman gets pregnant?

A: Condoms *are* usually *made out of* an elastic 有弹性的；灵活的 material called Latex 乳胶. *As for* 关于、就……而言 your other question 至于你的另一个问题, that’s a whole new class.

A: 好了，大家安静。作为学校课程的一部分，我们这周将学习性教育。 +
A: 现在我希望每个人都能认真对待这门课，性教育非常重要，我希望你们能提出尽可能多的问题。记住，这里没有愚蠢的问题。 +
B: 卡尔顿老师？性教育到底是什么？您会教我们像卡玛苏特拉那样的东西吗？ +
A: 不，杰森，性教育不是那样的。基本上，我们会讨论性传播疾病、避孕措施以及男性和女性的身体是如何工作的。 +
B: 我姐姐在大学里，她和朋友们都服用所谓的避孕药。我从来不明白那是什么，但我知道它与性有关。 +
A: 说得好，杰森！这将是我们第一节课的主题——避孕措施。正如你提到的，避孕药是其中一种方法。避孕药是女性每天服用的，以防止意外怀孕，但它不能保护她免受性传播疾病的感染。另一种流行的方法是使用避孕套。如果你有性生活，这可能是最好的方法，因为它不仅能防止女性怀孕，还能保护双方免受性传播疾病的侵害。怎么了，杰森？ +
B: 避孕套是用什么做的？女性到底是怎么怀孕的？ +
A: 避孕套通常是用一种叫乳胶的弹性材料制成的。至于你的另一个问题，那是一门全新的课程。 +

A: Continuing with our class, today we are going to study briefly the miracle of life. Many of you may think you already know how babies come to be, but I am sure that some of the things that we will be talking about today may surprise you. Billy can you turn on the projector please? Thanks. Ok, does anyone know what this is?  +
 +
B: Looks like a goat head to me!  +
A: Nice try, but this is a woman’s womb which contains her uterus and ovaries. The ovaries are packed with eggs and each month during the middle of the menstrual cycle, the ripest one will be sucked up by one of the fallopian tubes. This is called ovulation and the exact time of ovulation depends on the length of your cycle. In an average 28 day cycle, ovulation will most likely happen between the 12th and 15th days, counting day 1 as the first day of your last period.  +
B: That’s amazing! So each month, the woman produces these eggs and then waits for them to be fertilized?  +
A: Actually, every woman is already born with over four hundred thousand eggs! Some will start dying off immediately and others released during her fertile period.  +
B: What about the guys? I know they produce sperm and stuff.  +
A: That’s right! The man’s body has a tiny factory that produces sperm twenty four hours a day! Each ejaculation will release about a hundred million sperm so the factory is always pretty busy. The sole purpose of a sperm’s life is to fertilize the woman’s egg.  +
B: So, then we basically need to put one-and-one together so we can have babies right?  +
A: Yes, the man will have an orgasm during intercourse and ejaculate sperm and semen. Now this is where the race begins and all those millions of sperm will race and swim from the cervix, through the uterus to the fallopian tubes. This could take anywhere from forty five minutes to twelve hours! Not all of them make it, since some go the wrong way and get lost or simply die. Many will actually reach the egg but only one will penetrate it and fertilize it. Once this happens, the egg instantly changes and creates a protective shield once the sperm is safely inside.  +
B: And then? That’s it?  +
A: Well, the egg will be fertilized within about 24 hours of its release. The genetic material from the sperm combines with the genetic material in the egg to create a new cell that will rapidly start dividing. The woman is not actually pregnant until that bundle of new cells, known as the embryo, travels the rest of the way down the fallopian tube and attaches itself to the wall of her uterus. Any other questions? Then let’s move on.  +

B: 看起来像山羊头！ +
A: 不错，但这是一个女人的子宫，里面包含她的子宫和卵巢。卵巢里充满了卵子，每个月在月经周期的中期，最成熟的卵子会被输卵管吸入。这被称为排卵，排卵的确切时间取决于你的周期长度。在一个平均28天的周期中，排卵很可能在第12到第15天之间发生，第1天是你上次月经的第一天。 +
B: 太神奇了！所以每个月，女性都会产生这些卵子，然后等待它们受精吗？ +
A: 实际上，每个女性出生时就已经有超过四十万个卵子！有些会立即开始死亡，而其他卵子会在她的生育期释放。 +
B: 那男性呢？我知道他们产生精子之类的东西。 +
A: 没错！男性的身体有一个小小的工厂，每天24小时生产精子！每次射精会释放大约一亿个精子，所以工厂总是很忙。精子生命的唯一目的就是使女性的卵子受精。 +
B: 所以，我们基本上需要把两者结合起来才能有宝宝，对吧？ +
A: 是的，男性在性交过程中会达到性高潮并射出精子和精液。现在比赛开始了，数百万个精子将从宫颈穿过子宫游向输卵管。这可能需要45分钟到12小时！并非所有精子都能成功，因为有些会走错路而迷路或死亡。许多精子实际上会到达卵子，但只有一个会穿透它并使其受精。一旦发生这种情况，卵子会立即发生变化，并在精子安全进入后形成保护屏障。 +
B: 然后呢？就这样了吗？ +
A: 嗯，卵子将在释放后约24小时内受精。精子的遗传物质与卵子中的遗传物质结合，形成一个新细胞，并迅速开始分裂。女性实际上并未怀孕，直到那团新细胞（称为胚胎）沿着输卵管移动并附着在子宫壁上。还有其他问题吗？那我们继续吧。 +

在足球比赛中，free kick（任意球） 和 penalty kick（点球） 都是对犯规或违规行为的处罚方式，但它们的规则和执行方式有所不同。

[.my3]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a,1a,1a"]
|===
| |Direct Free Kick 直接任意球|Indirect Free Kick 间接任意球|Penalty Kick 点球

|犯规时的所在场地
|是在"场地任意位置"因犯规判罚的
|
|只能发生在"禁区内"的严重犯规

|通常因以下犯规被判:
|- 故意手球（非守门员）
- 拉拽、推搡对手
- 踢人、绊倒或跳向对方球员
- 恶意冲撞
- 用手或身体阻挡对方进攻
|- 守门员违规（如持球超过6秒、不当接回传球）
- 非恶意犯规（如危险动作、干扰比赛、越位等）
|- 当防守方在本方禁区内犯规（如拉人、踢人、手球等）时，裁判会判给进攻方点球。

|对对方的补偿:
|进攻方可以直接射门得分，无需传球。 +
执行时，防守方球员必须与球保持至少**9.15米（10码）**的距离。
|进攻方不能直接射门得分，必须至少由另一名球员碰触后才能射门。
|执行时：

- 球放在点球点（距球门11米），只允许一名球员主罚。
- 只有守门员可以防守，其他球员必须站在禁区外。
- 主罚球员在裁判鸣哨后射门，守门员不能提前移动离开球门线。
- 只要球在门柱内范围且越过球门线，就算进球。

A shotgun 霰弹枪 (also known as a scattergun 散弹枪, peppergun 胡椒枪, or historically as a fowling 捕猎（野禽） piece 猎鸟枪) is a long-barreled 长枪管的 firearm 枪支 designed to shoot 射击 a straight-walled cartridge (弹壳，弹药筒) 直壁弹壳 known as a shotshell 霰弹壳, which discharges (v.)发射 numerous (a.)众多的，许多的 small spherical 球形的 projectiles 弹丸 called (v.) shot 霰弹, or a single solid projectile （武器发射的）投射物；枪弹；炮弹 called a slug 子弹;独头弹. Shotguns are most commonly used as smoothbore 滑膛的 firearms 火器，枪炮, meaning that their gun barrels 枪管 have no rifling 膛线 on the inner wall, but rifled barrels 线膛枪管 for shooting sabot slugs 独头弹 (slug barrels) are also available.


霰弹枪（也称为散弹枪、胡椒枪，或历史上称为猎鸟枪）是一种长枪管的枪支，设计用于射击一种称为霰弹壳的直壁弹壳，**这种弹壳发射大量称为霰弹的小球形弹丸，**或一种称为独头弹的单一固体弹丸。霰弹枪通常用作滑膛枪，这意味着它们的枪管内壁没有膛线，但也有用于射击独头弹的线膛枪管（独头弹枪管）。

The shot pellets 弹丸 from a shotshell are propelled (v.)推动 indirectly  间接地 through a wadding 填塞物 inside the shell 壳 /and scatter (v.)散射;撒，播撒；（使）散开 upon leaving the barrel, which is usually choked (v.)使窒息;收口 at the _muzzle  枪口，炮口 end_ 枪口端 /to control the projectile scatter. This means /each shotgun discharge (n.)发射 will produce (v.) a cluster 群 of impact points 撞击点 *instead of* a single point of impact like other firearms.

Having multiple projectiles also means `主` the muzzle energy 枪口能量 `谓` is divided among the pellets 小球；（军）小子弹（枪用）, *leaving* each individual projectile *with* less penetrative (a.)穿透的 _kinetic  (a.)[力] 运动的；活跃的 energy_ 动能.

`主` The lack of _spin stabilization_ 旋转稳定 and _the generally suboptimal (a.)次优的 aerodynamic 空气动力的 shape_ of the shot pellets `谓` also make them less accurate 准确的 /and decelerate (v.)减速 quite quickly in flight (n.) *due to* drag 阻力, giving shotguns _short effective ranges_ 有效射程.

In a hunting 狩猎 context, this makes shotguns useful (a.) primarily 主要地，首要地，根本地 for hunting (v.) fast-flying birds and other agile 敏捷的 small/medium-sized game 中小型猎物 /without risking (v.) overpenetration 过度穿透 and _stray (a.)（动物）走失的，流浪的；离散的，零落的；（物理量）杂散的 shots_ 误射 to distant (a.)遥远的，久远的 bystanders 旁观者 and objects.


霰弹壳中的弹丸, 通过壳内的填塞物间接推动，并**在离开枪管时散射，枪口端通常收口, 以控制弹丸的散射。这意味着每次霰弹枪发射都会产生一群撞击点，而不是像其他枪支那样产生单一的撞击点。拥有多个弹丸也意味着枪口能量被分配到各个弹丸上，使得每个单独的弹丸具有较少的穿透动能。缺乏旋转稳定性, 和弹丸通常次优的空气动力学形状, 也使它们不太准确，并且在飞行中由于阻力迅速减速，这使霰弹枪的"有效射程"较短。在狩猎背景下，这使得霰弹枪主要用于狩猎快速飞行的鸟类, 和其他敏捷的中小型猎物，而不会冒险过度穿透, 或对远处的旁观者和物体造成流弹。**
