A: Can you help me write a newspaper ad?

me around the house.

我想雇人帮我做家务。

B: Oh, #you want to get a maid# 女仆，女佣?

A: Well, I think it’s better if you call her a
_cleaning lady_ 清洁女工 or _domestic help_ 家政助理.

[.my2]
我觉得你称她为清洁女工, 或家庭佣工比较好。

B: Ok, so what do you want her to do?

A: Well, let’s see. I want her to come in three
times a week for a couple of hours /to clean
the kitchen 厨房, bathroom /and maybe do some
cooking.

B: Got it. And how much do you offer per
month?

A: I would pay her hourly, I don’t know _what
the *going rate* 当前的标准 is_ though 不过，可是，然而.

[.my2]
我会按小时付她工资，不过我不知道现在的工资是多少。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.going rate
the amount of money that something costs at the present time: +
- the going rate for sth The going rate for a skilled architect in India is about $50,000 per year.

通行价格：某物品或服务的平均或通常价格。

====

B: I know _for sure_ it’s more than _minimum
wage_ 最低工资 /but maybe #you should just 仅仅做...就好,不必复杂化 negotiate (v.)（尤指在商业或政治上）谈判，磋商
with the person# that answers (v.) the ad.

[.my2]
我知道这肯定比最低工资高，但也许, 你应该和回复广告的人谈判。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.you should *just* negotiate with ...
在这里，“just”是一个副词，它的作用是： +
强调建议的**直接性和简单性。** 说话者希望对方**直接**与发布广告的人协商，*不要想太多或犹豫。* +
#*缓和语气。 尽管给出了建议，但“just”也起到了一种缓和语气的作用，使建议听起来不那么强硬或命令式。*# +
*表明“仅仅”协商就好。 意思是，你不用做其他的事情，仅仅协商就好。*

如果没有just, 两者的区别是: +
“you should negotiate with”和“you should *just* negotiate with”的区别

- “you should negotiate with”：这是一个直接的建议，表示“你应该与……协商”。语气相对直接，可能显得稍微正式或强硬。
- “you should *just* negotiate with”：这个表达方式增加了“just”，使建议听起来更轻松、更随和。它强调了协商的简单性和直接性，并缓和了语气。

因此，两者在基本意思上相同，但“just”的加入使语气更加柔和，并强调了协商的直接性。

A: Great! Thanks for your help!
