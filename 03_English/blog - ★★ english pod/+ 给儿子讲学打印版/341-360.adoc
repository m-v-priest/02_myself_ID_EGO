顺便提一下，英语人体解剖学用语vagina（阴道）就是直接借自拉丁语的这个词的。它开初只是作为戏称用于此义，因其亦属鞘状物。

.'All Set': A Phrase Beyond "Ready"

While all set commonly means "ready," it has developed a set of idiomatic uses (n.) that could confuse (v.) non-native speakers.  +
For example, "*are you all set*?" is often used to mean "*are you finished?*"  +
"*The bill is all set*" means that *the bill has been taken care of.*  +

And perhaps at a store you might hear "*do you need help or are you all set?*" implying that "all set" `谓` means *one needs no help*.

虽然“all set ”通常意味着“准备好”，但它已经形成了一套可能会让非母语人士感到困惑的惯用用法。例如，“你都准备好了吗？”通常用来表示“你完成了吗？” “账单已全部确定”意味着账单已经处理完毕。也许在商店里您可能会听到“您需要帮助吗？或者您都准备好了吗？”暗示“一切就绪”意味着不需要帮助。

Salesperson: Hello there, welcome to WineWorld. Let me know if I can help you out at all. Customer: Um, yes, please, I could really use some help. I’m going over to my boss’ house for dinner tonight and don’t know what kind of wine I should bring. Salesperson: OK, do you know what kind of food will be served? Customer: Well, his wife is Japanese. He said she makes really good sushi. Salesperson: Hmm, that’s a bit of a challenge. Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine. Well, let’s see. have to be a white wine, of course. Customer: Why? Wouldn’t a red wine go well with sushi? Salesperson: No, I don’t think so. Sushi is a very delicately flavored food, and red wine would be a jarring contrast. You need a white wine, which has more subtle flavors, to complement the fish. Customer: I see. So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay? That’s a white wine, right? Salesperson: Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I’m not sure it’d be your best bet. Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites, and tends to be a bit oaky. I’d suggest that you go for something brighter, like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand. Customer: Sauvignon Blanc? What’s that? Salesperson: That’s another varietal, or type of grape, just like Chardonnay. Customer: Let’s see. The label says it’s got ”attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp, mineral flavors and a bonedry finish. Serve chilled.” Oh, no, how long will it take to chill the wine? I’m on my way to the dinner now. Salesperson: It’s OK, don’t worry, we’ll just choose a wine from the cooler. We don’t have quite as extensive a selection over here, but...this Rhone Valley white would be lovely.  +
Customer: All right. What varietal is that? Salesperson: Well, this is a French wine, so they don’t always specify the varietal on the label. The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine. This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier, I’d guess. Customer: And you think this is a good wine? Salesperson: Yes, this is one of our best-sellers. It’s not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier, which means it’s more approachable. It’s light and crisp, with a bit of a vanilla aroma. Customer: Perfect! I’ll take it!  +

Customer: I see. So should I get a bottle of
Chardonnay 夏敦埃酒（一种类似夏布利酒的无甜味白葡萄酒）? That’s a white wine, right?

Salesperson: Yes, Chardonnay is a white
wine, but
I’m not sure it’d be _your best bet_ (打赌；赌注)最好的办法.
Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied 浓郁型
whites, and tends to be a bit oaky 橡木味的；橡木桶味的. I’d
suggest that you go for something
brighter, like this _Sauvignon Blanc_ from New
Zealand.

[.my2]
但我不确定这是你最好的选择。霞多丽是酒体较为浓郁的白葡萄酒之一，往往带有一点橡木味。我建议你喝点亮色的，比如这瓶来自新西兰的长相思。

Customer: Sauvignon Blanc? What’s that?

Salesperson: That’s another varietal 用葡萄名字命名的葡萄酒, or type
of grape, just like Chardonnay.

[.my2]
或者葡萄的种类，就像霞多丽一样。

Customer: Let’s see. The label says it’s got
”attractive 吸引人的，有吸引力的 citrus (n.a.)柑橘类果实 and grassy 长满草的；被草覆盖的 aromas (食品)芳香 that

- extensive（形容词）：修饰 selection，表示“广泛的”。
- a selection（名词短语）：表示“一个选择”或“品种”。这里是倒装结构，正常语序应为 a quite as extensive selection，但英语中"形容词+名词"的比较结构, 常采用这种倒装方式，即 as + adj. + a/an + noun （例如 as _good a book_ as...）。

状语（Adverbial）：over here +
over here（在这边）是地点状语，表示相较于其他地方，这里的选择不够多。

总结：
完整句子结构是 主语 + 谓语 + 宾语 + 状语，其中宾语 quite as extensive a selection 是一个包含比较级倒装的名词短语。

Customer: All right. What varietal （用单一特定品种酿制的）品种葡萄酒 is that?

[.my2]
好吧，这是什么葡萄品种？

Salesperson: Well, this is a French wine, so
they don’t always specify (v.)明确指出；具体说明 the varietal on the
label.
The French believe that the soil _a grape is
grown in_ is one of the most important factors
in the final flavor of the wine.
This wine is probably a blend （不同类型东西的）混合品，混合物 of a few
different types of grapes, mostly Viognier 维欧尼（葡萄品种名）,
I’d guess.

[.my2]
这是法国葡萄酒，所以酒标上不一定会标明具体的葡萄品种。法国人认为，葡萄生长的土壤是影响葡萄酒最终风味的重要因素之一。这款酒可能是几种葡萄的混合，以维欧尼（Viognier）为主，我猜。

Customer: And you think this is a good wine?


Salesperson: Yes, this is one of our bestsellers.
It’s not quite as dry as the Sauvignon
Blanc we were looking at earlier, which
means it’s more approachable 亲切友善的；易理解的；可接近的. It’s light and
crisp 凉爽的；清新的；干燥寒冷让人舒畅的, with a bit of a vanilla 香草精，香子兰精 aroma 芳香，浓香；（喻）气氛.

这款是我们的畅销酒之一。它不像我们之前看的长相思（Sauvignon Blanc）那么干，因此更容易入口。酒体轻盈清爽，还带有一丝香草的香气。

see!

B: Oh, hey, no kidding! I haven’t seen you
since orientation 新生入学指导;（任职等前的）培训，训练；迎新会 three months ago! So
how’ve you been 你最近怎么样?
*Settling into* 逐渐适应 college life OK?

A: Yeah, I think so! I pledged 宣誓加入(美国大学生联谊会) _Phi Iota Alpha_,
so I’m living at the _frat 兄弟会 house_ now.

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Phi Iota Alpha
一种美国大学生联谊会，成立于1931年，旨在促进拉丁美洲文化的传播和交流。

.frat
= fraternity

Greek Life指的是「fraternities (兄弟会)」和「sororities (妇女俱乐部；女学生联谊会)」等大學社團組織。 +
Greek Life 希腊生活：指美国大学校园中的兄弟会和姐妹会组织，通常以希腊字母命名，成员们参与各种社交活动、慈善事业和校园活动。

[.my3]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|组织
|- Frat (=fraternity) 兄弟会(男性加入)
- sorority 姐妹会(女性加入)

|存在目的
|- Greek Life 組織, 讓大學生能找到興趣相投的朋友。
- 成員可以決定要住在frat或sorority的房子，這樣一來就能夠跟其他Greek Life的家庭成員有更多相處的時間。

|在決定加入Greek Life之前，必須考慮以下幾點
|- 一般來說，一所大學有許多 fraternities 和 sororities，基於不同的價值觀，文化身份，學術和職涯發展，慈善事業或宗教信仰等。

- 成本：加入fraternity 或 sorority 的費用可能會很昂貴，例如：會費、舞會、校外旅行等活動的支出。
- 時間：Greek Life的活動需要投入很多時間，像是參加每週的會議、各種各樣的活動。如果你是跟組織成員一起住在frat或sorority房子中，*社交活動很容易會使你分心。維持良好學習成績也是很重要的。*
- Hazing： 有時候在Greek Life裡也會發生欺凌的事件， 尤其是在「pledge」期間，「hazing」指的是要參與一些有危險性活動的社會壓力，例如：強迫喝酒、至始至終滿足哥哥或姐姐的要求等等。然而，校方也有對此立下規範、幫助呈報事件，且譴責之。
