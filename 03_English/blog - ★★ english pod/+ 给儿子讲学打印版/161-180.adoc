B: For sure! I didn’t really understand some
of the technical jargon 行话，黑话 they used in the film
when they talked about social security in the

[.my2]
当然！我不太理解他们在电影中谈论美国的 social security（社会保障）时使用的一些 technical jargon（技术术语）。

A: Like what?

B: Well, they mentioned how people *put
away money* 把钱存起来 in something called a 401K?

[.my2]
他们提到人们把钱存进一个叫 401K 的东西里？

A: Yeah, I know it sounds weird 奇怪的，不寻常的, but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement 退休. Through a 401k, you can authorize (v.)批准，许可；授权 your employer to deduct 减去，扣除 a certain amount of money from your paycheck 付薪水的支票，薪水 and invest it in the plan. Everyone tries to contribute *as much as possible* so that when you retire, you can rest 休息，歇息 peacefully on your _nest  窝，巢 egg_ 储备金 .

[.my2]
是的，我知道这听起来很奇怪，但 401k 是一种 retirement plan（退休计划），允许员工为自己的退休储蓄和投资。通过 401k，你可以授权你的 employer（雇主）从你的 paycheck（工资）中 deduct（扣除）一定金额，并将其 invest（投资）到计划中。每个人都尽量 contribute（贡献）尽可能多的钱，这样当你退休时，你可以安享你的 nest egg（积蓄）。


B: That’s interesting and logical I guess. In my country, we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund 基金，专款, but most people don’t really trust it so they just invest in properties 房屋及周围的土地 or things like that.

[.my2]
这很有趣也很 logical（合理），我猜。在我的国家，我们也必须 contribute（贡献）到一个 government-run retirement fund（政府运营的退休基金），但大多数人并不真正信任它，所以他们只是 invest（投资）在 properties（房产）或类似的东西上。

A: That seems a bit unstable 不稳定的；动荡的；易变的 don’t you
think?

B: Yeah, but corrupt governments in the past
have created distrust 不信任，怀疑 among banks and
_financial institutions_ 金融机构, so now people prefer to
have money hidden in a jar 玻璃罐，广口瓶 or a _piggy bank_ 储蓄罐.

A:  +
You came into my life at a time when I needed you the most. We talked about so many things that I started to realize my heart and my soul could actually feel something other than hurt. You placed comfort where there was fear, confidence where there was doubt, a shoulder where tears could fall and completeness where there was emptiness.

Somehow I needed you to be a part of my life. The only problem was that I was willing to jeopardize everything to get that done.  +

亲爱的 Mary，我今天以这种方式来到这里，是因为我需要向你道歉。我让你失望了。虽然我没有用言语欺骗你，但我用不属于我的面孔欺骗了你。我从未想过要毁掉这段对我意义重大的友谊。你对我意义重大，现在我请求你的原谅。如果你心里觉得无法原谅我，那么我会理解并从这次经历中学习。

[.my2]
你在我最需要你的时候进入了我的生活。我们谈论了那么多事情，我开始意识到我的 heart（心）和 soul（灵魂）真的可以感受到除了 hurt（伤害）之外的东西。你在有 fear（恐惧）的地方放置了 comfort（安慰），在有 doubt（怀疑）的地方放置了 confidence（信心），在有 tears（泪水）的地方放置了 shoulder（肩膀），在有 emptiness（空虚）的地方放置了 completeness（完整）。 +
我如此迫切地想抓住这一切，以至于我做了任何能让你注意到的事情。我没有意识到的是，我可能会失去我的 entire being（整个自我），我所有的存在和我所有放在你身上的东西。

there when you needed to talk. I wanted to
be _the comfort for your soul_ 安慰你灵魂的人 when the world

realizing that I was destroying myself and
you. Somehow 不知怎么地 I needed you to be a part of
my life. The only problem was that I was
willing to jeopardize (v.)危及，损害 everything to get that
done.

[.my2]
我想成为那个在你需要倾诉时会在你身边的人。我想成为那个在世界难以承受时安慰你灵魂的人。我想成为那个在一切似乎不可能时为你坚强的人。我想以你应得的方式爱你，从未意识到我正在毁灭自己和你。不知何故，我需要你成为我生活的一部分。唯一的问题是，我愿意 jeopardize（牺牲）一切来实现这一点。


A: All the things _that I told you about how I

我告诉你的关于我的感受以及你让我感受到的一切都是真的。除了听到你快乐时声音中的笑声之外，其他一切对我来说都不重要。你让我的日子变得容易度过，让我的夜晚变得平静；你帮助我期待新的一天。即使距离将我们分开，只是存在就足够了。

A: I’m sorry for hurting you and if I had to
do all *over again* 重新，再一次 I would have been 100%
with you. Forgive me please.

我很抱歉伤害了你，如果我能重来一次，我会 100% 与你在一起。请原谅我。
