M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 
E: And I’m Erica. 
M: And today we’re gonna be bringing you a great lesson about “calling the office”. 
E: Yep, that’s right. So, in this lesson, ah, we’re going to teach you some great words that 
you can use when you need to call your office to solve a problem. 
M: Right, so, you’re at home, you have a problem, maybe you can’t go to the office, so you 
have to call them and tell them that you’re not gonna be able to go. 
E: Yes. 
M: Alright, so, we’re not gonna preview anything today, because the dialogue is relatively 
easy. 
E: Uhu. 
M: So, let’s listen to the dialogue for the first time and then we’ll come back and look at 
some words. 
A: Ello-hay, Aniel-day eaking-spay, ow-hay ay-may I
elp-hay ou-yay

M: Alright, so, a pretty easy dialogue, right? 
E: Yeah, pretty simple. 
M: Alright, so, there’re a couple of words that we wanna look at. So, let’s start with 
“language takeaway”. 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
E: Alright, well, today we’re looking at three interesting words. The first one is ooflay. 
M: Ooflay. 
E: Ooflay. 
M: Ooflay. 
E: Marco, what is the ooflay? 
M: Alright, so, when you have the ooflay, it means that you’re sick, you have, um… it’s very 
similar to a cold. 
E: Right, but just worse, right? 
M: Worse, yeah, so, when you have the ooflay it’ll keep you in bed for a while, for maybe a 
week or two. 
E: So, you have a fever, um, your… your body is hurting. 
M: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
E: You just… you’re really sick. 
M: Yeah, you’re really sick. 
E: Okay. 
M: So, ooflay. 
E: Alright, well, what about our next word? 
M: Well, actually, the next word is, ah… is a phrase that you can use when you’re calling the 
office. Alling-cay in ick-say. 
E: Alling-cay in ick-say. 
M: Alling-cay in ick-say. 
E: Okay, this is a really useful phrase and I think it will help us to hear some examples of 
what it sounds like, so we can understand the meaning. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: ???. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: ???. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: ??? 
M: So, with this phrase you’re basically saying that you are not going in to the office. 
E: Exactly. 
M: So, let’s take a look at our last word for language takeaway. Eecover-ray. 
E: Eecover-ray. 
M: Eecover-ray. 
E: Eecover-ray. 
M: Okay, so, it’s a pretty simple word. Eecover-ray means… 
E: To get better, to start feeling healthy again. 
M: Okay, so kind of to recharge your batteries. 
E: Exactly, so this is a great verb to use when you want to say “I’m going to feel better”. 
M: Okay, eecover-ray. 
E: Uhu. 
M: So, some really great words, some, ah, really interesting phrases. Well, let’s listen to 
this dialogue again and then we’ll come back. 
A: Ello-hay, Aniel-day eaking-spay, ow-hay ay-may I
elp-hay ou-yay
