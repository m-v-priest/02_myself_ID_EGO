M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 
E: And I’m Erica. 
M: And today we’re bringing you again the great series I’m sorry I love you, Part Six. 
E: The newest installment in the EnglishPod soap opera. 
M: Hehe. Drama, romance… 
E: Love, tragedy. 
M: Hehe. All of it here at EnglishPod and… and in our series. So, today we have a really 
great dialogue. 
E: I… I… I just can’t believe what’s happening here. 
M: Hehe. 
E: But before we get into it, we need to preview one word. 
M: That’s right, so let’s take a look at it in “vocabulary preview”. 
Voice: Vocabulary preview. 
E: Well, we’re gonna preview this word, sleeping with. 
M: Sleeping with. 
E: Sleeping with someone. 
M: Sleeping with him. 
E: Yes. 
M: So, it seems pretty easy, I mean sleeping with, that just sounds like you are in bed with 
somebody. 
E: Yeah, but you are doing a little bit more… 
M: Hehe.  
E: Than sleeping. 
M: Alright, so… so in English this phrase actually means that you are involved with 
someone and have an intimate sexual relationship, right? 
E: Yes, you are in a relationship with someone and you are having sex. 
M: Exactly, so be careful how you use it, because I know that sometimes you wanna 
translate and just say, well, they’re in the same bed together, but it’s not that they’re 
having sex. 
E: Right, so most of the time in English the phrase sleeping with means sex. 
M: Right, okay, sleeping with, be careful. 
E: Okay, well, let’s find out why are we talking about sleeping with? 
M: Hehe. Well, obviously, somebody is sleeping with somebody, so let’s listen to the 
dialogue and then we’ll come back and talk about [it]. 
A: This is ridiculous! I can’t believe you’ve been
sleeping with someone else! How could you do
this! You know what? I’m out of here!
B: Wait! Doctor how is this possible? I haven’t
cheated on my boyfriend!
C: I have something to confess... I’m sorry Veronica,
I lied.
B: Wait... what? What do do you mean?
C: I lied. You aren’t even pregnant; there’s no bun in
the oven. I was just so overwhelmed with jealousy
that I couldn’t help myself. Veronica I love you!
B: What are you talking about!!! Who are you?
C: It’s me! Daniel, don’t you remember me? From
high school. I sat behind you every day in class! I
used to go to every football game and watch you
in the cheerleading squad!
B: You are insane! We never even spoke! Why did
you lie like that to my boyfriend?
C: Because Veronica... It’s not fair! I love you; I have
since the first day we met! Everything was going
fine until that jerk came into the picture and ruined
everything! I went to med school and became a
doctor for you! You always said how you wanted
to marry a doctor! You will be mine now... one
way or another...
A: I heard everything, you lying bastard! Get your
hands off her!
 
M: Scandal, again. 
E: Oh, these… poor Veronica and Steven, I just… I don’t know how their relationship could 
get more complicated. 
M: It’s amazing they’re having an amazing, ah, adventure in their love life. 
E: I’m sure glad my love life looks nothing like this. 
M: Hehe. Alright, so, we saw some really great words, so let’s take a look at them in 
“language takeaway”. 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
E: The words we’re looking at now are about feelings. 
M: Uhu. 
E: And, so let’s take a look at the first one, confess. 
M: Okay, confess. 
E: To confess. 
M: To confess. So, confess, what does that mean? 
E: When you confess something, you… you tell a secret that you’ve been hiding. 
M: Okay, so, that’s pretty easy. So, you have a secret and you wanna tell it to someone, so 
you are confessing. 
E: Yeah, and it’s usually something negative. 
M: Negative… 
E: Uhu. 
M: Oh, Okay. 
E: So, Marco, I confess that I stole five dollars from you. 
M: Oh, you did? 
E: Yeah, sorry. 
M: Ah, okay… no wonder my wallet was lighter. 
E: Hehe. Yeah. 
M: Alright, so, confess. 
E: Uh. 
M: I shall not forgive you for this. 
E: Hehe. Oh, no. 
M: Alright, let’s take a look at our next word, overwhelmed. 
E: Overwhelmed. 
M: I’m overwhelmed. 
E: So, when I am overwhelmed, I am filled with emotion. 
M: Okay, with emotion. 
E: Uhu. 
M: It can be good emotions and bad emotions, right? 
E: Yeah, but you just… you feel too much. That’s like you’re… you’re… you’re going to 
explode. 
M: Okay, I’m overwhelmed with joy. 
E: Yes, or I’m overwhelmed with work. 
M: And I’m overwhelmed with jealousy. 
E: Like this guy. 
M: Right, and that’s our third word. 
E: Jealousy. 
M: Jealousy. So, this is interesting because jealousy is the noun. 
E: That’s right, it’s the feeling… 
M: Of being jealous. 
E: Wh… which is the adjective. 
M: Which is the adjective. So, what does it mean when you are jealous? 
E: It means that you… you see somebody and you want what they have. 
M: Okay, you want what they have. 
E: Yeah, so in this case the doctor is jealous of Veronica’s boyfriend, sh… because the 
doctor wants Veronica. 
M: Okay, jealous. 
E: Uhu. 
M: So… so, Erica, are you a… are you a jealous wife? 
E: Um, I don’t know, maybe a little bit. 
M: A little bit. 
E: But I’ve never gone to the extent of telling someone that they’re pregnant, when 
they’re not. 
M: Hehe. Alright, jealousy. Okay, and let’s take a look at our next two words which are 
actually kind of insult, right? 
E: Yeah, they’re not very kind words at all. 
M: Okay, but you gotta learn them anyways. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Okay, let’s take a look at this one, jerk. 
E: Jerk. 
M: He is a jerk. 
E: J-E-R-K, jerk. 
M: Jerk. So, what does it mean if someone is a jerk? 
E: A stupid and mean person. 
M: Hehe. As plain and simple as that. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Stupid and mean. So, can a woman be a jerk? 
E: It’s mostly male, but now it’s becoming more common to… to use with women as well. 
M: Okay, so, I can say he is a jerk or she is a jerk. 
E: Yeah, but it is more common for men. 
M: Okay, and now let’s take a look at our last word, you lying bastard! 
E: Bastard. 
M: Bastard. 
E: Bastard. 
M: Wow, this is pretty strong as well. 
E: Yeah, you gotta be careful about this one. 
M: Okay. 
E: This one is almost a swearword. 
M: Hehe. Almost. 
E: Yeah. 
M: It sounds like on the line. [NOTE: meaning on the line between being a swearword and 
not being a swearword] 
E: Yeah. 
M: So, what does it mean if you call someone a bastard. 
E: Well, literally it means your mother and father were not married when you… when you 
were born. 
M: When you were born. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Exactly. So, it is a pretty big insult. 
E: Yes. 
M: A little bit, I guess… 
E: But… but it doesn’t really really mean that your mother and father… 
M: Right. 
E: Weren’t married. 
M: Right. 
E: It just… 
M: But you’re… 
E: It means that you are a jerk. 
M: You’re a jerk, you’re really… 
E: You’re mean. 
M: Big jerk. 
E: You’re mean person, a really mean person. 
M: So, jerk isn’t as strong as a bastard. 
E: Yes. 
M: Right? 
E: Bastard is stronger. 
M: Okay, so, you gotta be careful when you throw that word in there or how you would use 
it and again it’s for men, right? Not for women. 
E: Yeah, you can’t use this word with women. 
M: Okay, that’s… 
E: There’s another one out there, but that will have to wait for another EnglishPod. 
M: Hehe. Well, apparently all of these words are just for men, what did we do wrong? 
E: I… Marco, I can't begin to tell you. 
M: Hehe. Okay. Okay, so let’s listen to our dialogue again and then we’ll come back and 
look at some great phrases. 
A: This is ridiculous! I can’t believe you’ve been
sleeping with someone else! How could you do
this! You know what? I’m out of here!
B: Wait! Doctor how is this possible? I haven’t
cheated on my boyfriend!
C: I have something to confess... I’m sorry Veronica,
I lied.
B: Wait... what? What do do you mean?
C: I lied. You aren’t even pregnant; there’s no bun in
the oven. I was just so overwhelmed with jealousy
that I couldn’t help myself. Veronica I love you!
B: What are you talking about!!! Who are you?
C: It’s me! Daniel, don’t you remember me? From
high school. I sat behind you every day in class! I
used to go to every football game and watch you
in the cheerleading squad!
B: You are insane! We never even spoke! Why did
you lie like that to my boyfriend?
C: Because Veronica... It’s not fair! I love you; I have
since the first day we met! Everything was going
fine until that jerk came into the picture and ruined
everything! I went to med school and became a
doctor for you! You always said how you wanted
to marry a doctor! You will be mine now... one
way or another...
A: I heard everything, you lying bastard! Get your
hands off her!
 
M: Alright, so, great stuff, jerk, bastard, all that good words going around. 
E: But we’ve got… also got some amazing phrases, so why don’t we take a look at those 
now in “fluency builder”. 
Voice: Fluency builder. 
M: Alright, so in fluency builder today we have three great phrases, let’s take a look at the 
first one. Bun in the oven. 
E: A bun in the oven. 
M: A bun in the oven. 
E: Okay, this is obviously an idiomatic phrase, right? 
M: Right. Well, it could be literal as well, right? 
E: Like you could actually have a piece of bread in your oven. 
M: Right, bun is a piece of bread. 
E: Yeah. 
M: In the oven, but in this context we’re not using it. 
E: No, um, it means you’re pregnant. 
M: You’re pregnant, so the baby is the bun. 
E: Yeah, and the oven is your stomach. 
M: Right, so, you say "She has a bun in the oven". 
E: Yes, she’s pregnant. 
M: She’s pregnant, okay. It could be difficult to understand if you don’t really, ah, have the 
explanation, right? 
E: Yes. 
M: You wouldn’t… you would say "What? She has bread in the oven?" 
E: What? Yeah, a bun in the oven. 
M: Okay, now let’s take a look at our second one. Couldn’t help myself. [NOTE: another 
one - can’t help but; for example, we can find this phrase in President Obama’s 
Inauguration Speech: “we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday 
pass”] 
E: I couldn’t help myself. 
M: I couldn’t help myself. 
E: So, when you can’t help yourself, you can’t control yourself. 
M: Right, you… you did something, be… but you couldn’t control it. 
E: You couldn’t stop it. 
M: You couldn’t stop it. Okay, so let’s listen to some examples of how you would use I 
couldn’t help myself, because i… it’s a phrase that you can use in many different ways, 
right? 
E: That’s right, let’s listen. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: I just couldn’t help myself when I saw your car I just had to buy it! 
Voice: Example two. 
B: I’m sorry I couldn’t help myself, I just started laughing. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: The cake was so good I couldn’t help myself I ate it all. 
M: Alright, perfect, couldn’t help myself, easy. 
E: Now, the doctor, he couldn’t help himself from lying to Veronica. 
M: Uhu. 
E: Because he was angry that her boyfriend Steven came into the picture. 
M: Came into the picture. 
E: To come into the picture. 
M: Okay, so, what does it mean when somebody comes into the picture? 
E: Well, basically, you appear in somebody’s life, you come into somebody’s life. 
M: So imagine that, your life is a picture… 
E: Aha. 
M: And somebody all of a sudden comes into it, so… 
E: They come into the picture. 
M: Come in… 
E: They come into your life. 
M: Come into your life. 
E: Yes. 
M: So, he’s angry that Steven appeared into Veronica’s life and they’re in love and all that 
stuff, right? 
E: Yeah, alright, well, these are some great phases and why don’t we listen to them again in 
context, so let’s listen to the dialogue. 
A: This is ridiculous! I can’t believe you’ve been
sleeping with someone else! How could you do
this! You know what? I’m out of here!
B: Wait! Doctor how is this possible? I haven’t
cheated on my boyfriend!
C: I have something to confess... I’m sorry Veronica,
I lied.
B: Wait... what? What do do you mean?
C: I lied. You aren’t even pregnant; there’s no bun in
the oven. I was just so overwhelmed with jealousy
that I couldn’t help myself. Veronica I love you!
B: What are you talking about!!! Who are you?
C: It’s me! Daniel, don’t you remember me? From
high school. I sat behind you every day in class! I
used to go to every football game and watch you
in the cheerleading squad!
B: You are insane! We never even spoke! Why did
you lie like that to my boyfriend?
C: Because Veronica... It’s not fair! I love you; I have
since the first day we met! Everything was going
fine until that jerk came into the picture and ruined
everything! I went to med school and became a
doctor for you! You always said how you wanted
to marry a doctor! You will be mine now... one
way or another...
A: I heard everything, you lying bastard! Get your
hands off her!
 
M: Okay, so, Veronica’s not pregnant, that was a close one. 
E: Yeah.  
M: Okay. 
E: Phewh, hoo. 
M: A… actually they’re not married, so this is a very controversial topic, right? 
E: Yeah. 
M: Being knocked up. 
E: Yes, nice phrase. 
M: Nice phrase. 
E: So… there’s a lot of interesting phrases and, um, an… and ways you can talk about 
pregnancy, so if you’re knocked up, you are pregnant. 
M: Right, so, you could hear that in movies. It’s not really… 
E: Yeah. 
M: I would say, a proper way of saying. 
E: No, it’s not that polite. 
M: Right. 
E: Because it… it… it gives you the idea that it was a mistake. 
M: Right. 
E: Uh. 
M: So, you would say she got knocked up. 
E: Yes, another common phrase is, um, pregers. 
M: Pregers.  
E: Yeah. 
M: I heard this is, ah, more Australian, right? 
E: Uh, she’s pregrous, so she’s pregnant. 
M: Aha. So, it’s actually a pretty interesting topic, I know that, for example, in Latin 
America if a girl that’s maybe in her early twenties… 
E: Uhu. 
M: Gets pregnant accidentally by her boyfriend… 
E: Aha. 
M: Usually the family is expected them to get married. 
E: Really? 
M: Yeah, so, it’s kind of like should they get married, should they not… 
E: So, there’s a lot of pressure. 
M: A lot of pressure, but it’s different in other countries, right? 
E: Yeah. So, I d… I don’t know for you guys, wha… what’s it like in… in your country, 
where… where you live. Is there pressure on the… the guy and the girl to get married? I 
mean should Steven and Veronica get married in this situation?  
M: Or what about just living together? 
E: Yeah. 
M: Or as they say living in sin, right? [NOTE: Living in sin = Living together without 
official marriage] 
E: Living in sin. 
M: Hehe. Living together, living in sin. 
E: Yep. 
M: So, is it okay to just live together with your… girlfriend or should you get married 
before? 
E: Uhu. 
M: This is the controversial topic, so we’ll have a lot of different opinions, but it should be 
interesting. 
E: Yes, so visit our website and tell us what you think, englishpod.com. 
M: Alright guys, we’ll see you there.
