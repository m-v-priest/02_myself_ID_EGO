M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 
E: And I’m Erica. 
M: And today we’re bringing you another sci-fi lesson for all of those fans out there of Star 
Trek and Star Wars. 
E: That’s right. And today we’re gonna focus on, uh, some phrases. We’re not gonna do any 
vocabulary today. We just gonna learn some phrases that you’ll find relating to science 
fiction. 
M: Okay, very good. So, why don’t we listen to our dialogue for the first time? And we’ll 
come back and look at all these phrases. 
A: Captain, we’re under attack by an unidentified
ship.
B: Damage report.
A: We’ve sustained heavy damage to the engines.
We’ve lost our warp drive.
B: We’ll have to attempt to make contact. This is
Captain Picard of the Starship Enterprise. We
don’t wish to engage. What is the nature of this
attack?
C: I am Captain Kor of the ship Klothos. Your ship
attacked our search party...
B: No! You’re not doing it right! Kor doesn’t sound
like that. His voice is deeper!
C: I am Captain Kor of the ship Klothos. Your sh...
B: No! If you can’t do a Klingon voice, I’ll have to find
a more serious Star Trek fan actor who actually
can, OK?
C: But... but... I already bought the Klingon suit! And
the wig...
M: Alright, very good. Star Trek fans, apparently they were trying to act out one of the 
famous episodes, where the Klingon’s attack the Enterprise. 
E: My goodness! Hehe. 
M: Hehe. 
E: I don’t know a lot about, um, Star Trek, but I do know a lot about language. And we’ve 
got some great stuff here that will help you understand, um, sci-fi movies and TV shows in 
English a little bit better. So, why don’t we go now to “fluency builder”? 
Voice: Fluency builder. 
M: Alright, so, the first phrase that we have today on fluency builder – unidentified ship. 
E: An unidentified ship. 
M: Unidentified ship. 
E: Unidentified ship. 
M: If we break it down and look at the first word – unidentified. 
E: You don’t know which one it is. 
M: Okay, you don’t know the identity. 
E: Yep. 
M: And a ship, I guess that’s short for… 
E: A rocket ship. 
M: A rocket ship. 
E: Or a spaceship. 
M: Okay. 
E: So, we’re not talking boats here. 
M: Alright. 
E: Yeah. 
M: We’re not talking about boats. Very good. Now, moving on to our second phrase: the 
Enterprise lost its warp drive. 
E: Warp drive. 
M: Warp drive. 
E: Warp drive. 
M: So, the warp drive of the Enterprise is actually something like an engine. 
E: Uhu. 
M: That allows it to go faster than the speed of light. 
E: So, superfast. 
M: Superfast. 
E: But why warp? 
M: Alright, well, if we take a look at the word warp that actually means to bend. 
E: Yep, so, like when you warp wood, it… it bends. 
M: Exactly. 
E: Yeah. 
M: You bend wood or you warp metal. 
E: Uhu. 
M: And, well, that’s kind of the theory behind it is that they’re going so fast, that they bend 
or warp time. 
E: Okay, so, warp drive. I think it… a very sci-fi specific phrase here. 
M: Right. Alright and for our third phrase today – search party. 
E: Search party. 
M: A search party. 
E: A search party. 
M: Okay, so, wh… what is this? Are we having a party? Wh… what’s going on? 
E: Well, when somebody gets lost… 
M: Uhu. 
E: Um, you know, maybe in the woods or something, you send out a search party to find 
them. 
M: So, a party would be a group of people. 
E: Exactly. 
M: So, that also happens in restaurants, I think, right? 
E: Right, sometimes you might say “how many people in your party?” 
M: In your party. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Very good. So, party – group of people. 
E: Alright, so, in the dialogue we saw that actually these were not real Star Trek characters, 
but they’re just acting. But it didn’t sound quite right, right? 
M: Yeah, he said that his voice is deeper. 
E: So, a deep voice. 
M: Deep voice. 
E: A deep voice. 
M: Alright, we’re gonna hear an example of what a deep voice sounds like. 
Example of deep voice. 
M: That is a deep voice. 
E: Now, because his voice wasn’t deep enough, he didn’t sound authentic. 
M: Authentic. 
E: Authentic. 
M: Alright, so, authentic, very easy word. 
E: Real, true-to-life. 
M: Real. 
E: Yeah. 
M: True-to-life, right? 
E: Uhu. 
M: Not fake. 
E: Exactly. So, um, Marco, is that an authentic Rolex? 
M: No, it’s not. Hehe. 
E: Hehe. 
M: But thank you for noticing. Alright, so, authentic. And our last word for today. 
E: A wig. 
M: A wig. 
E: A wig. 
M: Wig, W-I-G, wig. 
E: So, a wig is pretend hair, right? [NOTE: pretend might be also used as an adjective] 
M: Right, fake hair. 
E: So, the hair is not authentic. 
M: Ha, very good. Alright, so, a wig. 
E: Alright, we’ve got some great language here. And why don’t we listen to it one more 
time, slow down a little bit in the dialogue. 
A: Captain, we’re under attack by an unidentified
ship.
B: Damage report.
A: We’ve sustained heavy damage to the engines.
We’ve lost our warp drive.
B: We’ll have to attempt to make contact. This is
Captain Picard of the Starship Enterprise. We
don’t wish to engage. What is the nature of this
attack?
C: I am Captain Kor of the ship Klothos. Your ship
attacked our search party...
B: No! You’re not doing it right! Kor doesn’t sound
like that. His voice is deeper!
C: I am Captain Kor of the ship Klothos. Your sh...
B: No! If you can’t do a Klingon voice, I’ll have to find
a more serious Star Trek fan actor who actually
can, OK?
C: But... but... I already bought the Klingon suit! And
the wig...
M: Alright, now, it’s time for us to take a look at more phrases today in “fluency builder”. 
Voice: Fluency builder. 
E: Alright, so, we’ve got some phrases here that you can use together with a number of 
different words, right? 
M: Exactly. 
E: So, the first one: we heard that Data said “we’re under attack”. 
M: We’re under attack. 
E: Under attack. 
M: Alright, so, if we’re under attack, it means that we are being… 
E: Attacked. 
M: Attacked. 
E: Someone is shooting guns at you or trying to hurt you or something like that. 
M: Okay, so, we are under attack. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Very popular phrase that you would hear in war movies or something. 
E: Definitely. Now, you can change this by changing the last word: we are under fire. 
M: Under fire, which m… basically means the same thing. 
E: Yeah, excepting… when you are under fire, um, there’re guns involved. 
M: Okay, so, they’re shooting at you. 
E: Yep. 
M: Alright, we’re under attack; we’re under fire. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Alright, moving on to our second phrase: we’ve sustained heavy damage. 
E: Sustain heavy damage. So, when you sustain something, you receive it or you undergo 
this thing. 
M: So, usually, it’s related to injury or to receiving some type of… 
E: Of negative thing. 
M: Okay, so, why don’t we listen to some examples of how we could use sustain in context. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: John had a car accident and sustained a fatal injury. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: The boxer sustained a severe neck injury in the Championship fight. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: Luckily the warship didn’t sustain any serious damage. 
E: Alright, so, you see we… we typically sustain something like an injury, um… uh, or 
damage, that is negative. 
M: Very good. 
E: Uhu. 
M: And the last phrase for today: what is the nature of this attack? 
E: What is the nature of. 
M: What is the nature of. 
E: Okay, so, basically he’s just asking “why are you doing this?” 
M: Right, why… what is the reason? 
E: Yeah. 
M: What is the purpose? 
E: Uhu. 
M: So, again, we have some more examples of how you could use what is the nature of 
in different situations. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: What is the nature of your visit to the United States?  
Voice: Example two. 
B: What is the nature of the threat against our country? 
Voice: Example three. 
C: The nature of my visit is personal. 
E: Okay, so, a great phrase you can use, um, not only when you’re talking sci-fi, but in 
everyday life. 
M: Exactly. So, why don’t we listen now to the dialogue for the last time and then we’ll 
come back and talk a little bit more. 
A: Captain, we’re under attack by an unidentified
ship.
B: Damage report.
A: We’ve sustained heavy damage to the engines.
We’ve lost our warp drive.
B: We’ll have to attempt to make contact. This is
Captain Picard of the Starship Enterprise. We
don’t wish to engage. What is the nature of this
attack?
C: I am Captain Kor of the ship Klothos. Your ship
attacked our search party...
B: No! You’re not doing it right! Kor doesn’t sound
like that. His voice is deeper!
C: I am Captain Kor of the ship Klothos. Your sh...
B: No! If you can’t do a Klingon voice, I’ll have to find
a more serious Star Trek fan actor who actually
can, OK?
C: But... but... I already bought the Klingon suit! And
the wig...
E: Oh, Marco, I already admitted that I’m not much of a sci-fi fan. I don’t really know 
anything about Star Trek or Star Wars. 
M: Hehe. Well, it is a very popular show. I think it started around the Sixties of Seventies; 
the… 
E: Yep. 
M: The first version of Star Trek. And, well, many, many people follow it now. They dress 
up; they know the secret language that is used on the show; they know the spaceships. It’s 
a big culture. 
E: That’s true. And, speaking of culture, I think we’ve got, um, a Star Trek movie coming 
out pretty soon. So, some of this language can help you guys understand it a little bit 
better. 
M: Very good. Yeah, so, if you have any other questions or comments related to… not only 
to science fiction, but anything in general, please come to the website englishpod.com and

E: Well, thanks for downloading you guys and until next time… Good bye!
