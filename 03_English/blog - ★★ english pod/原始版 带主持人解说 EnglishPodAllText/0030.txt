M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco.  
E: And I’m Erica. 
M: Today we’re bringing you Part II of another great lesson that we had. 
E: Yes! New Guy In Town. 
M: The Ney Guy In Town. 
E: Part Two. 
M: Part Two. 
E: Aha. 
M: Kind of a creepy story. 
E: Yes. 
M: Yeah, and this one is also a little bit strange, a little bit weird. 
E: Yeah, unusual outcome, unusual ending. 
M: But it has to do a lot with invitations. 
E: That’s right, so, an invitation is when you ask somebody to do something with you. 
M: Right. 
E: Uhu. 
M: A dinner invitation. 
E: So, we’re gonna be talking about invitations and inviting people to do things. 
M: Okay. 
E: Well, with that, let’s listen to the dialogue for the first time. 
A: Oh, Armand, thank you for such a thoughtful invi-
tation! It’s really very nice of you to invite us over
for dinner, don’t you think so, Ellen?
B: Oh, yes of course! We’d love to come over. Can I
bring anything?
C: No, don’t worry about it; I’ll take care of every-
thing. I’ll see you tonight. Come with an appetite...
I know I will!
B: I don’t want go over to his place for dinner! He
gives me the creeps! Why on earth did you ac-
cept?
A: Oh come on Ellen, it will be nice to get to know
him. Besides, he’s new to the neighborhood, and
it would be rude to decline his invitation.
B: I guess so... You always rope me into things like
this!
C: Ladies! Thank you for coming! You look deli-
cious... I mean beautiful. Please come in.
A: Oh Oh Armand! You are too kind!
B: How did I get myself into this...
 
M: Wow! I’m really anxious to see what happens in… in this dinner party. 
E: Yeah, I guess we’ll have to stay tuned and find out… 
M: For Part Three. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Alright, well, we have some really great vocabulary, so, I guess we can start with 
“language takeaway”. 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
M: Alright, on language takeaway today we have three great words, uh, Erica, why don’t 
you start it soft with the first one? 
E: The first word is thoughtful. 
M: Thoughtful. 
E: Thoughtful. 
M: Thoughtful. 
E: So, when you’re thoughtful, you’re… kind, right? 
M: You’re kind, you’re considerate… 
E: Yes, you… 
M: To other people. 
E: You think about what the other person would like. 
M: Right. 
E: And you do that thing. 
M: It’s so thoughtful of you. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Our second phrase – give me the creeps. 
E: Give me the creeps. 
M: Give me the creeps. 
E: This is kind of a funny phrase, but I think if we listen to some examples, we’ll understand 
the meaning. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: Horror movies give me the creeps. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: Stop it! You’re giving me the creeps. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: I saw this really scary clown; he gave me the creeps. 
E: So, I can see this one means to make me feel uncomfortable. 
M: Right, it makes me feel… 
E: Like strange… 
M: Scared… 
E: Yeah, scared. 
M: Also. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Gives me the creeps. 
E: Uhu. 
M: And our last phrase for language takeaway – rope me into. 
E: Rope me into something. 
M: Rope me into something. 
E: Uhu. 
M: So, if you rope me into something, it’s… 
E: It’s like you convince me to do something that I don’t really wanna do. 
M: Right, so, I roped you into landing me your car. 
E: Yes, it was a bad idea. 
M: That was a bad idea. 
E: And you roped me into going out for beers after work. 
M: Yeah, that was a great idea. 
E: Mmm. 
M: Hehe. Alright, so, rope me into. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Convince. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Alright, so, I guess we could listen to our dialogue again. 
E: This time a little bit slower and you’ll be able to understand the language a little bit more 
clearly. 
A: Oh, Armand, thank you for such a thoughtful invi-
tation! It’s really very nice of you to invite us over
for dinner, don’t you think so, Ellen?
B: Oh, yes of course! We’d love to come over. Can I
bring anything?
C: No, don’t worry about it; I’ll take care of every-
thing. I’ll see you tonight. Come with an appetite...
I know I will!
B: I don’t want go over to his place for dinner! He
gives me the creeps! Why on earth did you ac-
cept?
A: Oh come on Ellen, it will be nice to get to know
him. Besides, he’s new to the neighborhood, and
it would be rude to decline his invitation.
B: I guess so... You always rope me into things like
this!
C: Ladies! Thank you for coming! You look deli-
cious... I mean beautiful. Please come in.
A: Oh Oh Armand! You are too kind!
B: How did I get myself into this...
 
M: Well, I guess that’s a lot more clearer and with that we can start “putting it together” 
today. 
Voice: Putting it together. 
E: Today we’ve got three words and phrases that we wanna show you how you can put 
together and use differently. 
M: Uhu. 
E: The first one is appetite. 
M: Appetite. 
E: Appetite. 
M: Appetite. 
E: So, appetite is like, ah, a strong desire for food, right? 
M: Right, an appetite. 
E: We’ve got some examples that show you how to use this phrase; let’s listen. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: Mmm, dinner smells so good; it’s giving me an appetite. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: You’re sure eating a lot; you must have a big appetite. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: I’m getting sick; I have a fever and I’ve lost my appetite. 
M: Okay, so, we saw some great examples of appetite. 
E: Uhu. 
M: You can lose your appetite. 
E: That’s right. 
M: You have a big appetite. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Small appetite. 
E: A healthy appetite. 
M: Right, so, it just means… 
E: A desire for food. 
M: Desire for foods. 
E: A hunger for food. Yeah. 
M: Okay. Great, what’s our second phrase for today? 
E: Get to know someone. 
M: Get to know. 
E: Get to know. 
M: So, when you get to know someone is you talk to them and you find out what they do. 
E: Yeah, you get more familiar with them. 
M: More familiar, right. 
E: Uhu. 
M: For example, we can say “I got to know her in Spanish class and she’s a really nice 
person”. 
E: Yeah, or you can say “Armand, Ellen and Doris got to know each other at a dinner party”. 
M: Right, or you can say “if you get to know me, you’ll see that I’m not a bad guy”. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Hehe. 
E: That’s true. 
M: Okay, get to know. 
E: And our third phrase is why on earth. 
M: Why on earth. 
E: Why on earth. 
M: Why on earth. This is the… uh, this is like a saying… 
E: Yeah. 
M: ??? expression. 
E: And you can use it in a lot of different ways, so, we’ve got some examples for you; let’s 
listen. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: Where on earth is my phone? 
Voice: Example two. 
B: How on earth did you learn English in one month? 
Voice: Example three. 
C: What on earth is it? 
E: So, when you ask a question with on earth - so, why on earth, how on earth, what 
on earth – it’s like you’re showing a lot of surprise. 
M: Okay, great stuff! So, let’s just listen to our dialogue a third time. 
A: Oh, Armand, thank you for such a thoughtful invi-
tation! It’s really very nice of you to invite us over
for dinner, don’t you think so, Ellen?
B: Oh, yes of course! We’d love to come over. Can I
bring anything?
C: No, don’t worry about it; I’ll take care of every-
thing. I’ll see you tonight. Come with an appetite...
I know I will!
B: I don’t want go over to his place for dinner! He
gives me the creeps! Why on earth did you ac-
cept?
A: Oh come on Ellen, it will be nice to get to know
him. Besides, he’s new to the neighborhood, and
it would be rude to decline his invitation.
B: I guess so... You always rope me into things like
this!
C: Ladies! Thank you for coming! You look deli-
cious... I mean beautiful. Please come in.
A: Oh Oh Armand! You are too kind!
B: How did I get myself into this...
 
M: We want to know what you think happens next. 
E: Yes, what happens in this dialogue next? 
M: So, we want you to send us your idea of what happens next and we’re going to choose 
the best one. 
E: That’s right, Marco and I will choose the best continuation of this story and we’ll use that 
in Part Three of the New Guy In Town. 
M: That’s right. 
E: Aha. 
M: So, you can give it any direction you want. 
E: That’s right. 
M: And, of course, we’ll publish the name of the author. 
E: Uhu. 
M: With the lesson. 
E: Yes. 
M: I’m really anxious to see what ideas come up and how we can end this dialogue. 
E: I know we’ve got a lot of really creative users out there, so, I’m really looking forward 
to this. 
M: That’s right, that’s right, so, be sure to send us your ideas either a private message or 
you can post it on the comment section of… 
E: That’s right. 
M: This lesson and any other questions or doubts. Go to englishpod.com and you can

E: Yes! Marco and I are always happy to answer your questions.
