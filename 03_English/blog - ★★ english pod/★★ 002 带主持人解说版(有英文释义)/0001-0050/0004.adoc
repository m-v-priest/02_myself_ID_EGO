M: Hello everyone /and welcome to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. +
A: I’m Amira. +
M: Hey, Amira, how are you today? +
A: I’m doing great! What about you? +
M: I’m doing pretty good! I’m excited about _this_, uh, _lesson_ 后定说明 that you have for us today. +
A: Yes, it’s actually a very, very useful lesson. It’s about _someone asking his boss for an
assistant_. +
M: Oh, okay, an assistant. +
A: Yes. +
M: What’s an assistant? +
A: Well, it’s someone /who helps you with your work around the office. +
M: Okay, great, so, let’s listen to this, uh, dialogue /and when we come back /we’ll take a
look at all the interesting and useful vocabulary that you’ll find. +

|A: ...like I told you before, we just don’t have the re-
sources to hire you an assistant. +
B: I understand that, but the fact is we’re under-
staffed  (a.)人员不足；人手太少. +
A: The timing is just not right. The economy is bad,
and it’s too risky *to take on* 雇佣 new staff. +
B: Yeah, I guess you’re right.... here’s an idea, what
if we hire an intern 实习生? She would take some of the
weight off my shoulders. +
A: She? +
B: Yeah, you know, a recent graduate 大学毕业生. She could
give me a hand 帮我一把 with some of these projects /and
we could keep our costs down 控制成本. +
A: That sounds reasonable... let me see _what I can
do_. +
A: Tony, I’d like to introduce you to your new assis-
tant. +
B: OK, great! Let’s meet her! +
C: Hi, I’m Adam. +
B: Oh... hi... I’m Tony...

A: And we’re back. Tony? Hehe. He’s surprised, ha? +
M: Yeah, he’s, uh… I don’t know *why though* he’s surprised. I think we should talk about
that a little bit later. +

.案例
====
.I don’t know why though he’s surprised.
这句话的语序在非常流利的口语中很常见，但更标准的语序应该是：
​​"I don’t know why he’s surprised, though."​


- Why​​: 表示“为什么”，用于提问原因。 +
- Though​​: 表示“然而”、“不过”、“但是”，用于引入一个相反的论点或表示转折。 +
- 当这两个词组合在一起时，​​"though"​​ 的语气被弱化了，它不再表示强烈的转折，而是为问题增加了一种​​委婉的质疑、好奇或思考​​的色彩。


主要陈述​​: "I don’t know why he’s surprised." (我不知道他为什么惊讶。) +
添加的语气 ("though")​​: 这个 though 为整个句子增添了一层含义，相当于在说： +
•“...*不过，他的这种惊讶, 让我觉得有点没道理/难以理解。*” +
•“...*但说实话，我觉得他根本没必要惊讶。*” +
•“...*但在我看来，这事并不令人意外啊。*” +

说话者用 though 来表达自己的观点：​​我认为他的惊讶, 是出乎我意料的（或者是不应该的）​​。

"why though"​​ 通常用在非正式的口语中，带有以下一种或多种语气：

|1.真诚的困惑：
|A: Mike hates chocolate. (Mike讨厌巧克力。) +
B: *Why though*​​? It's so good! ( ​​为啥啊​​？巧克力这么好吃！)

|2.委婉的质疑或反驳​​（就像你的例句）
|He said he's quitting his job. ​​*I don't know why though*​​, he just got a promotion. (他说他要辞职。​​我真不明白为啥​​，他刚升了职啊。) -> 言下之意：我觉得他这个决定很傻。

|3.深入探讨​​：
|The movie was successful. ​​*Why though​​?* Let's analyze its marketing strategy. (电影很卖座。​​不过原因是啥呢​​？我们来分析一下它的营销策略吧。)

A: Yes, for now 目前；暂时 let’s look at some interesting vocabulary and phrases here. Marco, I know
you’ve chosen one for us. +
M: Yeah, the first one /that I wanna take a look at /is resources. +
A: Resources. +
M: Resources. +
A: Resources. +
M: And _that means_, in this text, basically, _money_. +
A: Right. +
M: So, the office doesn’t have enough money. +

A: Okay, I’ve chosen another interesting word for you /and that’s understaffed (a.)人手不足的；人员不足的. +
M: Understaffed. +
A: Understaffed. +
M: Understaffed. +
A: Now, understaffed means that /they don’t have enough people working there. +
M: They don’t have enough workers. +
A: Right, they don’t have enough employees. +

M: Perfect! Okay, um, the next one is _timing is just not right_ 时机不对. +
A: The timing is just not right. +
M: The timing is just not right. +
A: The timing is just not right. +
M: Okay, let’s listen to /how we can use this entire phrase in a different situation, so then
we can understand what it means. Let’s listen.

Example one. +
A: I was gonna sell my house, but the timing is just not right.

Example two. +
B: Honey, I think we should have a baby. +
C: The timing is just not right. +

M: Okay, great, I guess _that makes it_, uh, _clear_. +
A: Yes, actually, it’s very obvious 明显的，显然的 /that *it means that* it’s just not a good time. +
M: Right, perfect! +
A: Yeah, I have another interesting phrase for you, which is _weight off my shoulders_ 解脱,放下肩头重担. +
M: Weight off my shoulders. +
A: Weight off my shoulders. +
M: Weight off my shoulders. +
A: So, _to take weight off my shoulders_ 卸下我肩上的重担 is another way of saying “to help me with my
work” or “to take some of my work away from me”. +
M: If you have a lot of things to do /and I come and help you /that means that _I *took* some of
the weight *off* your shoulders_. +
A: Yes. +

M: Let’s look at _the next_, uh, _phrase_ /that we have here /and it’s _give me a hand_. +
A: Give me a hand. +
M: Give me a hand. +
A: Give me a hand. +
M: Okay, now, this is not literal, it’s not that /I’m gonna give you somebody’s hand, right?
Let’s listen to some examples /and then we can come back and explain what it means.

Example one. +
A: Can you give me a hand with these boxes?

Example two. +
B: Neil, I’ll need you to give me a hand with this sales report 销售报告.

Example three. +
C: Here, let me give you a hand with your suitcase (（旅行用的）手提箱，衣箱) 我来帮你提箱子吧. +

A: Alright,__ give me a hand__ is another way of saying “help” or “to help out 帮助”. +
M: Exactly, to help out. +
A: Right. +
M: Perfect. +

A: Now, `主` the last phrase we’re going to look at here in this dialogue `系` is _keep our costs
down_. +
M: Keep our costs down. +
A: Keep our costs down. +
M: Keep our costs down. +
A: So, _to keep our costs down_ means to try and not spent (v.) so much money. +
M: Exactly, many companies, for example, now, uh, control (v.) how much printing you do 你的打印量. +
A: Yes. +
M: Right? +
A: Yes. +
M: To keep the costs down of paper. 降低或控制纸张的成本 (=*To keep* the cost of paper *down*) +
A: Yeah, so, in other words /they do not want to have unnecessary spending. +
M: Perfect! Okay, I think it’s time for us to listen to this dialogue one more time, but I want
everyone to listen and see /why Tony is surprised _at the end_ /when he meets (v.) his intern,
when he meets his assistant. +

C: Hi, I’m Adam. +
B: Oh... hi... I’m Tony...

A: Well, you know, Marco, I think that /Tony was really surprised, because he was kind of
hoping to have a female intern? +
M: Yeah, I think /that’s exactly what he was expecting. Maybe this guy is a little bit sexist (a.)（尤指对女性）性别歧视者的,
he thought that /an intern 实习生 should be a girl, but instead he was surprised. +
A: Instead _he got Adam_ 结果他得到了亚当! Hehe. +
M: Exactly, and it looks like Adam is really big and really tall, because he’s got that deep 
voice. +
A: Right, an intern, Marco, do you wanna elaborate (v.)详细说明，详尽阐述 on that? 你想详细说明一下吗？ +

M: Working at a company, uh, with a very low salary /or sometimes no salary at all, but
_what you’re gaining_ is experience 经验，阅历 /and you’re, um, learning (v.) a lot of things. Everyone /`主` who
_has, um, been an intern_ or _has had an intern_ `谓` knows that 每个“当过实习生的人”和“带过实习生的人”都知道 /sometimes , um, they are not treated (v.)
all that well 他们并没有得到那么好的待遇, sometimes they just serve (v.) coffee or… or they have to do paperwork 文书工作, so… +
A: Or like photocopying (v.)影印；复制；复印 things 或者像复印东西 and…  +
M: Exactly. +
A: Yeah. +
M: But some internships are really, really cool /and some are really good experiences for,
uh, learning. +
A: Yes, definitely, um… actually, I… I know friend of mine, she used to 曾经 work (v.) as an intern /in
one of those really big companies /and she told me that /she has gained (v.) so much experience
doing that. +
M: Yeah, I mean /_even if_ you don’t get paid, `主` the experience that you get `系` is really good and,
um, that just *opens doors for* maybe getting another job /or sometimes `主` the interns `谓` *get hired* 获得被雇佣
by the company to stay, because they do such a good job. +

[.my2]
嗯，这可能会为获得另一份工作打开机会之门，有时实习生也会被公司录用留下来，因为他们工作表现非常出色。

A: Yeah, I think _that’s mostly the case_ 大多数情况下都是这样, ha? +
M: Yeah, that happened to me once, I started working as an intern /and after three months /I
was hired by the company, so, it does happen, believe me. +
A: So, you did a good job. +
M: Uh, yeah, of course. +
A: Hehe. +

M: Alright, folks, we’re out of time today. I hope that /you enjoyed our lesson /and, uh, we’ll
be back tomorrow with another really cool and really interesting lesson from EnglishPod.
Don’t forget to come to our website at englishpod.com /where you’ll find some really great
and interesting resources /to help you learn and improve your English even more. +
A: Yes, you should definitely do that. And Marco and I would love to receive your comments 
and suggestions /that you can leave (v.) on our community forum, but for now, it’s time for us to
say… +
M: Bye! +
A: Bye!
