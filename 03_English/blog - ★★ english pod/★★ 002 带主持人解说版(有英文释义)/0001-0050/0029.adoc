M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. +
E: And I’m Erica. +
M: We’re bringing you an advanced lesson today. +
E: That’s right, an advanced lesson where we talk about investing in emerging markets. +
M: Right, so, it’s kind of a business topic, it’s kind of a world topic as well. +
E: Yes. +
M: And it’s pretty difficult. +
E: Yeah, it is really hard. +
M: Right, so, if you’re listening and you don’t understand everything, please don’t get 
discouraged, don’t, uh, worry about, because we are here to learn. +
E: Yes, and we’re here to help you. +
M: Right. +
E: Uhu. +
M: So, let’s get started with this. I’m really excited about this lesson. +
E: Yeah, okay, well, Marco, maybe you can tell us a little bit what is an emerging market? +
M: An emerging market is a market that is starting to develop. +
E: Okay. +
M: And it’s growing rapidly. +
E: So, you can maybe give some examples of… emerging market? +
M: Well, for example, China is an emerging market. +
E: Yeah. +
M: In the last years it’s been growing rapidly. +
E: More and more people are… are moving to the middle class and have money to spend. +
M: Right, exactly. +
E: Uhu. +
M: So, China’s like a really great example of an emerging market. +
E: Alright, well, with that let’s listen to the dialogue for the first time. +
A: Dad, I’d like to borrow some money. +
B: Sure, Johnny, how much do you need? five 
bucks? +
A: Come on, Dad, I need thirty thousand. I wanna 
get into the market. You know, I’m tired of hearing
all this news about the economic downturn, the
inevitable recession, people stuffing their money
in their mattresses. I look at this as an opportunity.
This is a chance for me to get a jump start on
building my nest egg. +
B: I don’t know about that; with all the uncertainty in 
the markets right now, it would be a very unwise
decision to invest. I don’t know if you’re aware
son, but there has been a lot of turmoil in the mar-
kets recently. There have already been half a mil-
lion layoffs in the last few months, and we have
no idea how the proposed stimulus package will
impact the economy. There’s just too much insta-
bility. I wouldn’t feel comfortable investing in this
climate. +
A: But look at it this way, every challenge is an oppor- 
tunity. And anyway, I’m not talking about investing
in the domestic market. There are emerging mar-
kets that promise great returns. Look at China, for
example; they have 1.4 billion people, half a billion
of whom have recently entered the middle class.
Here alone, the aggregate demand for consumer
goods represents an amazing wealth generating
opportunity. +
B: Come on, son, you’re looking at this too naively, 
the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of
instability, and their currency has been devalued
by almost a whole percentage point. +
A: Fine, then! If that’s the way you feel, so be it. But 
you’re losing out on a great opportunity here. I’m
going to go hit up Mum for the cash.
 
M: Well, it sounds like the dad has missed out on a really big investment opportunity, 
hey? +
M: Yeah, his… and his son is pretty smart. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Hehe. Pretty smart little boy. +
E: Aha. +
M: Okay, so, we have, uh, some great words that we wanna look at here. +
E: Uhu. +
M: Why don’t we start with the first one – turmoil. +
E: Turmoil. +
M: Turmoil. +
E: Turmoil. +
M: So, we have some great examples of… how turmoil is used in different sentences, so… +
E: Uhu. +
M: Let’s listen. +
Voice: Example one. +
A: With the civil war, a famine and inflation the country has been in turmoil for ten years. +
Voice: Example two. +
B: There’s been a lot of turmoil in my life recently: I’ve moved to new city, I’ve change my 
job, I broke up with my girlfriend. +
Voice: Example three. +
C: The devaluation of the dollar caused the great deal of turmoil in the markets. +
M: So, turmoil is a state of… +
E: Of uncertainty, of change, of difficult times. +
M: A little bit of chaos… +
E: Yeah. +
M: Some sort of, yeah. +
E: Yeah, yeah. So, for example when there’s a lot of turmoil in the market that means stock 
prices are changing drastically from day to day. +
M: Right, or the economy is in turmoil, it… there’s a lot of problems going on. +
E: Yeah, uncertainty. +
M: Uncertainty. Okay. +
E: Uhu. +
M: Good word. Alright, and we also saw something really interesting in the dialogue… +
E: Yes. +
M: About a proposed stimulus package. +
E: A proposed stimulus package. +
M: So, a proposed stimulus package is something that’s going on now. +
E: Yes, let’s break this phrase down. +
M: Uhu. +
E: So, we’ve got stimulus package. +
M: A stimulus package, uh, something to stimulate the economy, right? +
E: Right. So, money from the government to get the economy moving. +
M: To get it moving. +
E: Aha. +
M: Stimulus package. +
E: Proposed. +
M: It means that it hasn’t been approved yet. +
E: Right, it’s suggested. +
M: It’s suggested. +
E: Uhu. +
M: It’s an idea. +
E: Uhu. +
M: So, the proposed stimulus package for the US economy, for example, is a hundred and 
fifty billion dollars. +
E: Right, it’s a hundred and fifty billion dollars of American taxpayers money that the 
government wants to put into the economy to keep it moving. +
M: To keep it moving, right. So, if it works or not, that’s still a debate, but… +
E: Yeah. +
M: Hehe. It’s a proposed stimulus package. +
E: Let’s move to our third phrase - aggregate demand. +
M: Aggregate demand. +
E: Aggregate demand. +
M: Aggregate demand. +
E: So, demand is pretty clear, but this word aggregate, what’s that about? +
M: Aggregate is like, uh, combined, added. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Right? +
E: Yeah. +
M: Aggregate demand. For example, in a country like China… +
E: Uhu. +
M: Where cities like in… Shanghai or cities like Beijing… +
E: Yeah. +
M: Where more and more people are accumulating wealth… +
E: Uhu. +
M: The aggregate demand is increasing. +
E: Right. Right, the combined demand for consumer goods is growing. +
M: Right. +
E: Uhu. +
M: More people more… have more money, so they’re spending more. +
E: Yes. +
M: Okay. +
E: You know, Marco, there’s a ton of excellent language in this dialogue, isn’t there? +
M: Yeah, a lot of good stuff here. +
E: Yeah, and we wanna listen to the dialogue one more time, but before we do, we have 
three words for you that we want you to listen for. +
M: Yeah, pay attention to these words: nest egg. +
E: Nets egg. +
M: Inevitable. +
E: Inevitable. +
M: And hit up. +
E: Hit up. +
M: So, from the context of the dialogue try and see if you can figure out what they mean, 
but after listening to it we’ll come back and explain it anyways. +
A: Dad, I’d like to borrow some money. +
B: Sure, Johnny, how much do you need? five 
bucks? +
A: Come on, Dad, I need thirty thousand. I wanna 
get into the market. You know, I’m tired of hearing
all this news about the economic downturn, the
inevitable recession, people stuffing their money
in their mattresses. I look at this as an opportunity.
This is a chance for me to get a jump start on
building my nest egg. +
B: I don’t know about that; with all the uncertainty in 
the markets right now, it would be a very unwise
decision to invest. I don’t know if you’re aware
son, but there has been a lot of turmoil in the mar-
kets recently. There have already been half a mil-
lion layoffs in the last few months, and we have
no idea how the proposed stimulus package will
impact the economy. There’s just too much insta-
bility. I wouldn’t feel comfortable investing in this
climate. +
A: But look at it this way, every challenge is an oppor- 
tunity. And anyway, I’m not talking about investing
in the domestic market. There are emerging mar-
kets that promise great returns. Look at China, for
example; they have 1.4 billion people, half a billion
of whom have recently entered the middle class.
Here alone, the aggregate demand for consumer
goods represents an amazing wealth generating
opportunity. +
B: Come on, son, you’re looking at this too naively, 
the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of
instability, and their currency has been devalued
by almost a whole percentage point. +
A: Fine, then! If that’s the way you feel, so be it. But 
you’re losing out on a great opportunity here. I’m
going to go hit up Mum for the cash.
 
M: So, the kid wants to invest, because he wants to set up his nest egg. +
E: That’s right, so, basically, he wants to get a bunch of cash together, so that he can buy a 
house or get married or… +
M: Uh. +
E: Whatever. It’s that… it’s the money you need to start your life, right? +
M: To start your life; your nest egg. +
E: Uhu. +
M: It’s kind of a weird way of referring to this money, right? +
E: I guess it is kind of funny. +
M: Hehe. And also the little boy talked about an inevitable recession. +
E: Yes, inevitable. +
M: Inevitable. +
E: Inevitable basically means, uh, unavoidable. +
M: Right. +
E: So, this guy thinks that the recession is unavoidable. +
M: It’s gonna happen. +
E: Yes, inevitable. You know, this word inevitable. If you apply the root word, you can get 
a noun, an adjective or an adverb, right? +
M: Right. +
E: So, we’ve got some examples where you can see this word in action. +
Voice: Example one. +
A: Jason knew he was going to get laid off, but he was trying to delay the inevitable. +
Voice: Example two. +
B: As a new manager, it’s inevitable that you’re going to make mistakes. +
Voice: Example three. +
C: Inevitably, we’ll all die at the end of our lives. +
M: So, as you can see, the noun and adjective form are the same. +
E: Yes, inevitable. +
M: Inevitable. When we use it as an adverb though, we add the “-ly” to it. +
E: Inevitably. +
M: Inevitably. +
E: Yes. +
M: So, yeah, as you can see, we could use it in many different ways depending on what we 
wanna say. +
E: Right, well, inevitably, we have to move on to our third word. +
M: Hit up. +
E: Hit up. +
M: So, he says he’s going to hit up Mom for the cash. +
E: Ask his Mom. +
M: Yeah, hit up. +
E: Yeah, this is kind of a slangy term, isn’t it? +
M: Yeah, it’s a… it’s more informal… +
E: Yeah. +
M: Uh, a l… a lot more slangy, yeah. +
E: We… we wouldn’t really use it with your boss, would you? +
M: No, you’re not gonna go up to your boss and say “hey, I need to hit you up for some 
cash”. +
E: No. +
M: Hehe. +
E: So, Marco, I think this word is only applying to money, right? +
M: Well, you wouldn’t go up to your boss and say “oh, I need to hit you up for… some 
vacation time”. +
E: No, it’s typically used like… +
M: For money. +
E: For money. +
M: In this context, yeah. +
E: Yeah, yeah. +
M: Hit ’em up. +
E: We’ve got some examples of the phrase hit up. Let’s listen. +
Voice: Example one. +
A: I’m gonna hit up the boss for a raise. +
Voice: Example two. +
B: Are you trying to hit me up for money? +
Voice: Example three. +
C: Oh, I don’t have any cash. Have you tried hitting up Sophie? She’s rich. +
M: Okay, so, this is our first Advanced lesson. I hope you enjoyed it. It is a lot more 
challenging, I think. +
E: Yes. +
M: Especially, because it’s said in a business context, so, ??? So, we have a lot of specific 
words and a lot of technical vocabulary. +
E: That’s right. Marco, you’re exactly right and I think that our users are gonna have a lot 
questions about the language in this… in this lesson. So, I’d like to invite you guys to come
to our website at englishpod.com. +
M: Exactly, where you can leave all your questions and comments and we’ll be there to 
answer them. +
E: Yes. +
M: But until then it’s… +
E: Good bye! +
M: Bye!
