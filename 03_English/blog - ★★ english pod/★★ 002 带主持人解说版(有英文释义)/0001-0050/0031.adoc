M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. +
E: And I’m Erica. +
M: And today we’re bringing you another great lesson about appointments. +
E: That’s right. We’ve got an elementary lesson about canceling an appointment. +
M: It’s a really common situation… +
E: Uhu. +
M: Sometimes you have an appointment at the doctor’s or something. +
E: Or at work. +
M: And you have to cancel it. +
E: Yes, so we’re gonna learn some great language to help you cancel appointments today. 
Let’s go straight to the dialogue then. We’re going to be listening as Samantha and Angela
have a phone conversation and Angela is trying to cancel an appointment. +
M: And it’s gonna be a little bit fast in the beginning, but when we come back, we will 
explain all the great vocabulary. +
A: Hello, Samantha speaking. +
B: Hi Samantha. This is Angela calling. +
A: Oh, hi Angela, what’s up? +
B: I’m just calling about our meeting today. I wonder, 
is it possible to reschedule our appointment in the
afternoon? I have a bit of an emergency that I
need to take care of. +
A: Let me see, it shouldn’t be too much of a prob- 
lem... +
B: I’m really sorry, I hope it doesn’t inconvenience 
you too much, it’s just this thing came up, and ... +
A: Angela, you know what, I can’t make it to our 
meeting, either. Why don’t we postpone it to to-
morrow afternoon at the same time? +
B: Sounds great. See you tomorrow. +
C: Angela..Angela, look up! See that lady over there 
who is trying on a red leather jacket? Isn’t that
Samantha? +
B: What? No wonder she told me she couldn’t make 
it to the meeting, oh, no, I think she saw me...
 
M: Okay, we have some really interesting words that you’ve probably listened to in this 
dialogue, so… +
E: Uhu. +
M: Let’s start with “language takeaway”. +
Voice: Language takeaway. +
M: Today on language takeaway we’re brining you three words. Ah, Erica, what’s the first 
one? +
E: The first word is reschedule. +
M: Reschedule. +
E: Reschedule. +
M: Reschedule. +
E: When you reschedule an appointment, you… +
M: Change it for another day or time. +
E: Exactly. +
M: Great, the second word that we have is inconvenience. +
E: Inconvenience. +
M: Inconvenience. +
E: Inconvenience. +
M: So, to inconvenience someone is to… +
E: To make things not convenient for that person. +
M: Hehe. Alright. So, to make things a little bit difficult… +
E: Yeah. +
M: Or to make things a little bit, uh… +
E: Uncomfortable. +
M: Uncomfortable. +
E: Uhu. +
M: Inconvenience. +
E: And our third word is… +
M: Postpone. +
E: Postpone. +
M: Postpone. +
E: Postpone. We have some examples of the word postpone that will help you to understand 
its meaning a little bit better. Let’s listen. +
Voice: Example one. +
A: Since Robert is late again, we have to postpone the meeting. +
Voice: Example two. +
B: I’m sorry Simon, but your vacation has been postponed until next month. +
Voice: Example three. +
C: Unfortunately, the flight will be postponed. +
M: Okay, so, basically, postpone is to delay. +
E: That’s right. Make it at a latter time. +
M: At a latter time. +
E: Uhu. +
M: Okay, some great words there and, ah, we can listen to our dialogue a second time at a 
slower speed. +
A: Hello, Samantha speaking. +
B: Hi Samantha. This is Angela calling. +
A: Oh, hi Angela, what’s up? +
B: I’m just calling about our meeting today. I wonder, 
is it possible to reschedule our appointment in the
afternoon? I have a bit of an emergency that I
need to take care of. +
A: Let me see, it shouldn’t be too much of a prob- 
lem... +
B: I’m really sorry, I hope it doesn’t inconvenience 
you too much, it’s just this thing came up, and ... +
A: Angela, you know what, I can’t make it to our 
meeting, either. Why don’t we postpone it to to-
morrow afternoon at the same time? +
B: Sounds great. See you tomorrow. +
C: Angela..Angela, look up! See that lady over there 
who is trying on a red leather jacket? Isn’t that
Samantha? +
B: What? No wonder she told me she couldn’t make 
it to the meeting, oh, no, I think she saw me...
 
E: Alright, so, in this dialogue we had some really great phrases that we should look at in 
“fluency builder”. +
Voice: Fluency builder. +
E: We have three phrases for you today in fluency builder and the first one is so common, 
it’s a great phrase – what’s up? +
M: What’s up? +
E: What’s up! +
M: Hehe. So, this is a very common way of saying “hi”. +
E: Yeah. +
M: What’s up? +
E: How’s it going? What’s going on? +
M: Right, and now the interesting thing is it… th… many people don’t know how to answer 
this phrase. +
E: Yes, I see this all the time with my students. +
M: So, if you say “what’s up”, you should say… +
E: Not much. +
M: Not much. +
E: Nothing. +
M: Nothing. So, what’s up? +
E: Not much. Hehe. +
M: Not much. Hehe. Alright, so the next time someone’s tell you “what’s up”, now you know 
what to answer. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Okay, our second phrase is can’t make it. +
E: Can’t make it. +
M: I can’t make it. +
E: We use this phrase when we want to say “I cannot attend”, I… +
M: I cannot make it. +
E: Yeah, I can’t come. +
M: Right, so, if you’re having a party today, I say “oh, I’m sorry, I can’t make it”. +
E: Uhu. +
M: Ah, it means I can’t go. +
E: Exactly. Maybe one more example: so, Marco, we’ve got a meeting today at three 
o’clock. +
M: I can’t make it, I’m recording today. +
E: Oh, okay. +
M: Hehe. So, can’t make it. +
E: Uhu. +
M: Our last word for fluency builder – this thing came up. +
E: This thing came up. +
M: This thing came up. +
E: This is a great way of giving an excuse for why you can’t make it… +
M: Right. +
E: ???. +
M: So… +
E: Uhu. +
M: I can’t make today, because this thing came up. Like something… +
E: Something happened. +
M: Something happened. +
E: Yeah. Let’s listen to a few examples of this phrase, so we can see how it’s used in the 
wild. +
Voice: Example one. +
A: I’m sorry that I’m late, this thing came up at work and I had to stay to take care of it. +
Voice: Example two. +
B: I can’t talk right now, something came up. +
Voice: Example three. +
C: Sorry I missed the meeting, something came up. +
M: Okay, great examples and I guess it’s perfectly clear now. +
E: Yes. +
M: So, let’s listen to our dialogue a third time and now we’re ready to understand 
everything. +
A: Hello, Samantha speaking. +
B: Hi Samantha. This is Angela calling. +
A: Oh, hi Angela, what’s up? +
B: I’m just calling about our meeting today. I wonder, 
is it possible to reschedule our appointment in the
afternoon? I have a bit of an emergency that I
need to take care of. +
A: Let me see, it shouldn’t be too much of a prob- 
lem... +
B: I’m really sorry, I hope it doesn’t inconvenience 
you too much, it’s just this thing came up, and ... +
A: Angela, you know what, I can’t make it to our 
meeting, either. Why don’t we postpone it to to-
morrow afternoon at the same time? +
B: Sounds great. See you tomorrow. +
C: Angela..Angela, look up! See that lady over there 
who is trying on a red leather jacket? Isn’t that
Samantha? +
B: What? No wonder she told me she couldn’t make 
it to the meeting, oh, no, I think she saw me...
 
M: So, Erica, have you ever canceled an appointment like this, uh, under false pretenses? 
[NOTE: or by false pretenses; doing something under/by false pretences means making
sort of an intentional misrepresentation in order to obtain anything] +
E: So, for… for fake reasons? +
M: For a fake reason… to shopping. +
E: Um, well, I may not have… you know, told my boss “oh, I can’t make it to a meeting, 
because this thing came up” and then I really was going shopping… +
M: Uhu. +
E: I… I’ve never done that. +
M: Hm. +
E: But how about you, Marco? +
M: Well, you know in Ecuador soccer’s a really big thing. +
E: Right. +
M: So, um, when we were playing in the World Cup… Ecuador was playing and… +
E: Not you, but… +
M: Well, no like… +
E: Yeah. +
M: The… the Ecuadorian soccer team. +
E: Aha. +
M: I canceled an appointment, because I was gonna go watch the game. +
E: Really… +
M: Yeah +
E: A business appointment? +
M: A business appointment. +
E: Well, I guess that’s okay. +
M: Yeah, I mean it was like the first time we were ever in the World Cup and, you know, my 
boss didn’t really put up much of a fight, because I guess he also wanted to go watch the
game. +
E: So, very similar to the… events in this dialogue. +
M: Very similar. +
E: Uhu. +
M: I guess that’s kind of the inspiration behind it. +
E: Alright, guys, I hope you found some these phrases helpful and useful. And remember if 
you have any questions about anything you heard in today’s lesson, please visit our website
at englishpod.com. +
M: Right, there you’ll be able to find more resources and also a large community to interact 
with. +
E: Yes, including me and Marco. +
M: Right. +
E: Uhu. +
M: So, we’ll see you there, until then it’s… +
E: Good bye! +
M: Bye!
