M: Hello English learners! And welcome to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. +
A: I’m Amira. +
M: Alright, Amira is here today 阿米拉今天也在这里 /and she’s going to tell us about the wonderful lesson she has
prepared this time. +
A: Well, thank you, Marco. Well, today we have a very interesting lesson prepared for you. 
It’s about someone _cutting in line_ 插队. +
M: Cutting in line, okay. +
A: Yeah, it happens all the time /and we all get very upset 心烦的；沮丧的；不安的 about it, but you know, it
happens. +
M: Right, right. Well, I imagine that /everyone is wondering what _cutting in line_ is. Why don’t
we just listen to the dialogue one time /and then when we come back, Amira and I will gladly
explain all the vocabulary in this dialogue. +
A: Let’s listen. +

|A: I can’t believe /it took us two hours to get here. The
traffic in New York is unbelievable 难以置信的；惊人的. +
B: Yeah, but just relax (v.) honey, we’re here /and we’re
going on vacation 去度假. In a few hours /we’ll be in
Hawaii, and you’ll be on the golf course 高尔夫球场. +
A: Oh no! Look at that line! It must be a mile long 它一定有一英里长!
There’s no way I’m waiting for another two hours. +
B: Honey... don’t... +
C: Hey man, the end of the line is over there 队伍的尽头在那边. +
A: Yeah... +
C: No seriously, I was here first, and you can’t _cut in
line_ like this. +
A: Says who? +
C: I do! +
A: So sue (v.)起诉，控告 me! （表挑衅，认为对方无法奈何自己） +
C: Alright...that’s it....
|===


 
A: Whoa, I think there’s punching 用拳猛击；殴打. +
M: Yeah. Yeah, I guess this guy was as just _a crazy_… I don’t know, _impatient man_, ha? +
A: Yes, yes, but we don’t wanna talk about this now, but for now 目前；暂时 we will treat 探讨；处理 some of the
vocabulary and very useful phrases in the dialogue, so… +
M: Great. +
A: Marco, do you wanna start? +
M: Yes, let’s take a look at our first word, it would be _unbelievable_. +
A: Unbelievable. 难以置信的；惊人的 +
M: Unbelievable. +
A: Unbelievable. +
M: Exactly, and _just how you say it_ 正如你（刚才）说的那样,就跟你说的完全一样, it’s something incredible, something amazing. +
A: Yeah, but I would like to point out that /unbelievable was used here /to describe the man’s
frustration 沮丧；懊恼. He’s not happy about the traffic in New York. +

M: Exactly, perfect 完全正确的，极其准确的. Okay, in the next part /the woman, she’s trying to calm and relax her
husband /and she says that they, um… they’ll be in Hawaii in a few hours and, um… you’ll
be on the golf course. +
A: Right, so, we’ll be in Hawaii /and you’ll be on the golf course. +
M: Yes, we’ll be in Hawaii /and you’ll be on the golf course. +
A: So, this is a great way of talking about your physical location 物理位置;实际位置；实体位置 in the future. +
M: Right, so, for example, Amira, tomorrow where will you be? +
A: Don’t worry, Marco, I’ll be in the office tomorrow. +
M: Perfect. Right, that’s where I need you to be. 正是那里,我需要你去的地方  +
A: Yes. +

M: Okay, s… +
A: Alright, well, I have another interesting phrase here /for you 我这里有另一个有趣的短语 – must be _a mile long_. +
M: A mile long 一英里长（常表夸张）. +
A: A mile long. +
M: A mile long. +
A: Now, that’s basically not a mile, it’s not a kilometer long, but it’s another way of saying 
that /this line is really, really long. +

M: Right, it’s just an exaggeration 夸张；夸大. Um, now let’s li… take a look at _there’s no way_. +
A: There’s no way 不可能；没门儿. +
M: There’s no way. +
A: There’s no way. +
M: Perfect, let’s, uh, listen to some other examples on how, uh, we use _there’s no way_ in
a different situation /and then we can come back /and talk about it a little bit more.

Example one. +
A: _There’s no way_ I can *have* those reports *finished* today. 我今天不可能完成那些报告。

Example two. +
B: The stadium is *so* crowded /*that* _there’s now way_ we’ll find a seat.

Example three. +
C: Do you think /Michael’s gonna buy that house? +
D: _There’s no way_ he has enough money to buy it. +

A: Alright everyone, so, _there’s no way_ is another way of saying “It is impossible”. +
M: Exactly, _there’s no way_ you should miss this podcast 你绝对不可能错过这个播客, right? +

A: Yes. Well, I have another phrase for you as well – cut in line 插队；加塞. +
M: Cut in line. +
A: Cut in line. +
M: Cut in line. +
A: Cut in line. +
M: So, again, we have some really good examples on how you could use this phrase in 
different situations. Let’s listen to the examples /and then we can come back /and talk about
it some more.

Example one. +
A: Excuse me, I’m really late. Can I *cut in line*, please?

Example two. +
B: I hate it /when people *cut in line* at the bank. It’s so rude. +
C: I think it’s okay /when a pregnant woman *cuts in line*. +

A: Alright, everyone, cut in line. +
M: Right, so, from the examples /we can understand that /it means (v.) /when you are standing in
line /somewhere and somebody gets in front of you. +

A: Right. I have another phrase for you here – sue (v.) me. +
M: Sue me. +
A: Sue me. +
M: Sue me. +
A: Okay, now, _sue me_ is not a nice phrase. If you hear that /you know you’re in trouble. +
M: Yeah, it’s, uh… it’s kind of rude _I guess_ /to say “Sue me”. 我觉得说“告我”有点粗鲁 +
A: Right. Well, it actually means like /taking someone to court 起诉某人，把……告上法庭 and asking for money,
because someone has harmed you _in a way_ 以某种方式. I think that /we should listen to the dialogue
one more time /and try to figure out /why he used that phrase /and if he’s really going to take
him to court. +

|A: I can’t believe it took us two hours to get here. The
traffic in New York is unbelievable. +
B: Yeah, but just relax honey, we’re here and we’re
going on vacation. In a few hours we’ll be in
Hawaii, and you’ll be on the golf course. +
A: Oh no! Look at that line! It must be a mile long!
There’s no way I’m waiting for another two hours. +
B: Honey... don’t... +
C: Hey man, the end of the line is over there. +
A: Yeah... +
C: No seriously, I was here first, and you can’t cut in
line like this. +
A: Says who? +
C: I do! +
A: So sue me! +
C: Alright...that’s it....

M: Alright, we’re back. Now, this guy /when he says “Sue me” /he’s just being rude, I mean
he’s just being, uh, kind of… 有点儿；稍微 +
A: Impolite 不礼貌的；粗鲁的. +
M: Impolite and telling him “I don’t care”. +
A: Right. +
M: Right. +
A: Exactly, like… +
M: Do… like you can’t do anything about it 你对此无能为力. +
A: Yeah, yeah. +

M: Okay, today in the studio /we have a guest. Uh, her name is Sarah /and she’s form
England. +
S: Hi there. +
A: Hello. +
M: Alright, so, um, we’re gonna be asking her a couple of questions /and she’ll be a frequent
guest 常客 on our shows, so, you can expect to hear from her a lot. +
A: Well, she didn’t know that. +
S: It’s a… Yes, it’s a surprise, but… +
M: She knows now. +

A: Well, Sarah, uh, our topic today is about _jumping the queue_ 插队；加塞（英式英语）. +
M: Okay, Amira, wait. What is this, uh, jump the queue? +
A: It’s the same as _cut in line_ 插队；加塞（美式英语）, but in British English. +
M: Uh, okay. +
S: Yes, queuing <英>排队（等候） is very important in England. We’re very proud of our queues <英>（人、汽车等的）队，行列. +
M: Hehe. +
A: Hehe. +
S: It’s true, it’s true. +
A: So… so, what would be the reaction of people /if they like, you know, cut in line? +
S: I think /we… do take it very seriously, I’m laughing now, but it’s… it’s quite… it’s quite
serious, so, you don’t *jump the queue*. If people, you know, uh, jump in front of you /it’s…
uh, you’ll get a little tuts 啧啧声（表不满或不耐烦） “Oh”, you know, “Shouldn’t… shouldn’t be doing that” /and then…
then we make it very obvious 把它表现得很明显；让别人清楚地看出 and… +
A: So, you *say it out loud* 你大声说出来. +
S: We… we would, uh, you know, perhaps say something. And we have systems, you know, 
in London on the, um, on the metro 地铁（美式英语，英式英语常用 underground）, um, on… on the underground. You have to stand  (v.)  on
the… the escalators 自动扶梯 on the right and… and queue… /and you can’t jump in front, you have to
walk on the left /and queue (v.)排队（等候） on the right. +
M: Wow! +
S: It's all very serious /as those rules and regulations. 这一切都非常严肃，就像那些规章制度一样。 +
M: Hehe. +
A: Hehe. Wow. +
M: Is there like a queue handbook 排队手册（虚构的指导排队规则的手册）? +
S: Well… +
M: You have to read in high school and kind of 在某种程度上；更或少地 take a test 参加考试 on? 你必须在高中时阅读，然后参加测试 +
S: Perhaps that should be, that should be, yeah. +
M: Wow. +

A: What about New York, Marco? +
M: Well, no, definitely 肯定地，当然, I guess _this_, um, _dialogue is similar to_, ah, _reality_ of New York. If
somebody gets in front 走到… 前面；插队到… 前面  of you, cuts the line, somebody’s gonna say something /and probably
*end up 最终陷入；以… 告终 in* a fight… +
A: Oh-oh. +
M: If the guy is rude. Yeah. +
A: Oh my God. +

M: Yeah. Well, ah, Sarah, why don’t you tell us /is there _a line or a queue_ for _almost
everything_ in England?

[.my2]
你能不能跟我们说说，在英国是不是几乎干什么都要排队？ +

S: It seems like /*we do… just like* to form (v.) a queue. 看起来我们只是喜欢排队。 +
M: Hehe. +
A: Yeah, so, um… you know… +
M: Can you think of some other examples of where *you would…* /normally *you wouldn’t
queue* (v.), but you do? +

[.my2]
你能想到其他一些通常不需要排队、但（在英国）却需要排队的例子吗？

S: Oh, gosh… um, things like /in the supermarket when you’re trying to find some
vegetables 蔬菜 or something… I’d never push… I’d never… *reach around* 伸手绕过（某人 / 某物） (一种动作，通常指从一个人的背后伸手去够另一个人或物) or… +

[.my2]
哦，天啊…… 嗯，比如在超市里，当你想买些蔬菜之类的东西时…… 我从来不会推别人…… 也从来不会…… 伸手绕过别人去拿东西，或者…… +

M: Oh really? +
S: I’d just wait /until that person had finished picking out my stuff /and then… and then go in. +

[.my2]
我只会等着，直到那个人挑完他的东西，然后…… 然后我再过去挑。

M: Uh. +
S: So, it’s just… just trying… 只是尽量 +
M: So, if like five people want to buy oranges at the supermarket, then you have _a little
mini queue_ of five people. +

[.my2]
所以，比如要是有五个人想在超市买橙子，那你们就会形成一个小小的、只有五个人的队伍？

S: Maybe, maybe, a little bit, just… +

[.my2]
可能吧，会有一点这种情况，只是…

M: Waiting. 等着（别人挑完）  +
S: There’s no… there’s no sort 种类；类型… just *shoving 猛推；乱挤；推撞 through* 挤过去；推搡着通过 to the front, you just don’t do that. +

[.my2]
没有…… 没有那种…… 就是直接挤到前面去的情况，你肯定不会那么做。


A: You don’t *stick your hand out* 伸出手；把手伸出来 and grab the… like a tomato. +
S: Well, if you do, again, you would *make sure* that person knows “Oh, I’m sorry, um, you
know, just… I’m… uh… in a hurry…" or so. But, yeah, it’s just `主` letting someone go before you
`系` is ??? I think… +

[.my2]
嗯，要是你真的那么做了，那你肯定要让对方知道 “哦，不好意思，嗯，你懂的，就是…… 我…… 呃…… 有点赶时间……” 之类的话。不过，是啊，我觉得…… 让别人先做（这件事）这种事本身就…… +

M: Okay. +
S: It’s quite important to us. +
M: Alright. +
A: Right 没错. +
M: Great stuff 说得好. +

A: Thank you so much, Sarah. +
S: It was a pleasure 这是一件令人愉快的事,不客气. +
M: Yeah, we’ll *have you back* very soon 我们很快会再邀请你过来的, so… +
S: Ouh. +
M: Alright, we’re out of time, but we’ll be back tomorrow with another lesson /and be sure to
visit our website. Don’t forget that englishpod.com has _many, many resources_ and also 此外，而且；也，同样  _a
community of users and teachers_ /that can help you, answer questions and interact with
you. +
A: Yes, and you should definitely view suggestions 你们绝对应该看看建议, but _for now_ I wish you all well and… Bye! +
M: Bye! +
S: Bye!
