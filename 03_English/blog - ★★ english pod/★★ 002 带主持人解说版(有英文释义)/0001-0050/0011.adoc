== 中文释义



M: Hello everyone! And welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. +
E: And I’m Erica. +
M: And today with Erica /we have an upper intermediate 中高级的；中级以上水平的 lesson. +
E: That’s right, an upper intermediate lesson that’s a little bit strange. +

[.my2]
这节中高级课程内容会有点特别。

M: It’s a little bit strange, but it’s a real English lesson, because that’s what we give you here at EnglishPod. +

[.my2]
是有点特别，但它是一节实用英语课，因为这正是我们《英语播客》想带给大家的内容。

E: So, in today’s lesson /we’ve got a lot of really great language for you, we’ve got language to help you to gossip (v.)闲聊，说长道短；传播流言蜚语 better. +
M: Gossip! Why don’t you, ah, explain (v.) it a little bit _just in case_ 以防万一? +

[.my2]
要不你还是稍微解释一下，以防有人不清楚？

E: Okay, so, if I gossip (v.), I maybe *share* news or information about other people *with* my friends. Like /I might say something like “Marco, did you see what happened in ChinesePod today? You’ll never guess what I saw!” +
M: Exactly, that’s gossip /and we also have language today to describe 描述；形容 things. +
E: To describe strange things. +
M: Strange things. Alright, so, let’s take a look at our “vocabulary preview”. +

Voice: Vocabulary preview. +
E: So, on our vocabulary preview /we’ll look at a few important words that will help you to understand the dialogue a little bit better. +
M: Exactly, and the first word is weird 奇怪的；怪异的；反常的. +
E: Weird. +
M: Weird. +
E: Weird. +
M: Now, this is a common word you probably hear all the time in a lot of different situations 情况；形势；场合，so, we wanna to explain it today. +
E: Yeah, uh, this word just means strange. +
M: It’s strange. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Weird person is a strange person. +
E: Exactly, but `主` the thing about this word `系` is /if you are a young person, let’s say 比如说 under the age of thirty five (35), you’ll probably use it about a hundred times a day. +
M: Hehe. Weird. +
E: Yeah. +
M: It’s just such a good sounding 听起来不错 word 这个词读起来就很顺口 –- weird. +
E: It is. +
M: Okay, but the thing is that /_even though_ that it’s probably more commonly used (v.) in American English, it’s still widely used  (v.) for British English as well. +

[.my2]
不过要说明的是，虽然这个词在美式英语里更常用，但在英式英语里也很普及。


E: Yeah, that’s true. +
M: So, but maybe in British English /you would say something like… +
E: Odd 奇怪的；反常的. +
M: It’s odd. +
E: Yeah. +

M: That’s more common. Okay, let’s look at our second word – housewarming (n.)乔迁庆宴 gift 乔迁礼物（搬家后为庆祝新居送的礼物）. +
E: Housewarming gift. +
M: Housewarming gift. +
E: Housewarming gift. +
M: Now, this is a cultural thing 文化习俗, it’s really common in North America /to give a _housewarming gift_ to someone. +

E: Yeah. +
M: I’ve never gotten one of those…   我还从来没收到过呢 +
E: Really? +
M: Cause I don’t have a home. +
E: Oh… +
M: Hehe. +
E: Where do you live? On a street? +
M: Well, I don’t have a… uh, my own home, so, I have never gotten one of those. +

|A: Oh, I don’t know if you heard 不知道你听说了没有, but someone moved into that old house _down 在下方，在低处；在南部，向南方 the road_. +
B: Yeah, I know. I met the owner 主人；所有者 of the house yesterday /as he was moving in. His name is Armand. +
A: Really? What’s he like? You have to *fill me in* 向我详细说明；把情况告诉我. +
B: Actually, he’s a bit strange. I don’t know... I’ve got a bad feeling 不祥的预感 about him. +
A: Really? Why? +
B: Well, yesterday I brought over a _housewarming gift_, but Armand started acting really weird, and then he practically *kicked me out* 把我赶出去；撵我走! I tried to, sort of, peek (v.)偷看；窥视 into his house, but everything was *so* dark inside /*that* I couldn’t really get a good look. +
A: Well, you’ll never guess what I saw this morning. A delivery truck 送货卡车 pulled into 到达,驶入 his driveway （住宅前的）车道, and it *dropped off* 放下；卸下 a long, rectangular 长方形的；矩形的 box. It almost looked like a coffin 棺材! +
B: You see! Why would he...  你看吧！他怎么会  +

E: Ooh, that guy seems kind of weird. +
M: Hehe. You can hear /his voice is like a weird guy, right? +
E: Yeah. +
M: Hehe. Alright, let’s take a look at our “language takeaway”. +

Voice: Language takeaway. +
E: So, our language takeaway *focuses on* several words from the dialogue /that we feel are really important for you to know. +
M: Exactly /and we have four of them for you today. Why don’t we look at the first one? +
E: Okay, so, the first word is _a bad feeling_ 不祥的预感. +
M: Bad feeling. +
E: A bad feeling. +
M: A bad feeling. +
E: So, we’ve got a few examples /that will help you to understand how this phrase works. +

Voice: Example one. +
A: I don’t like Kelly’s new boyfriend. I’ve got a bad feeling about him. +

Voice: Example two. +
B: It’s so dark. We shouldn’t be _up here_. I’ve got a bad feeling about this. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.We shouldn’t be up here.
这里的 ​​“up”​​ 不是一个简单的方位介词，它承载了丰富的​​空间和心理含义​​。

在这个句子中，​​*“up”​​ 的核心功能是​​表示“在（一个更高、更偏远、更危险或更不该在的）地方”​​。 +
它传达的不仅仅是一个位置，更是一种​​不适宜、不安全或不该在此的感觉​​。*

在恐怖、惊悚的语境中（从“天这么黑”、“我有种不祥的预感”可以推断），​​“up”​​ 传递了更深层次的不安感：​​与世隔绝/孤立无援​​：高处往往与“孤立”、“远离安全区（如地面、房屋、人群）”联系在一起。*up here 暗示他们离开了安全的“下面”，到了一个孤立无援的境地。*

为了更好地理解，可以对比一下： +
•​​“be up here”​​ (在【上面】这里) -> 身处高点，常伴有负面情绪（危险、孤立）。 +
•​​“be down here”​​ (在【下面】这里) -> 可能身处低点、地下室或安全区内，也可能有被困的感觉。 +
•​​“be out here”​​ (在【外面】这里) -> 强调在户外、野外，可能远离庇护所。 +
•​​“be in here”​​ (在【里面】这里) -> 强调在室内，可能有受困或受保护的感觉。 +
====

Voice: Example three. +
C: I’ve got a bad feeling about this trip. I feel like _something is going to happen_. Maybe we shouldn’t go. +

M: Okay, so, basically /you think something bad is gonna happen. +
E: Yeah, you have a… sort of uncomfortable 不舒服的；不安的 feeling. +
M: Okay, that makes sense. I have a bad feeling about something. +
E: Exactly. +

M: Okay, let’s look at our second word now – kicked me out. +
E: Kicked me out. +
M: Kicked me out. +
E: Kicked me out. +
M: So, when someone kicks you out, it’s they force 强迫；迫使 you to leave. You don’t want to leave, but they force you to leave. +
E: Yeah, Marco, have you ever kicked someone out of your class? +
M: Um, yes, I have, I’ve kicked… +
E: Really? +
M: Yeah, if you misbehave (v.)行为不端；举止失礼 in my class, you’re kicked out. +
E: You’re pretty strict 严格的；严厉的, ha? +
M: Hehe. Sometimes I am. +
E: Okay. +
M: Um, okay also maybe you’ve kicked your husband out of bed. +
E: Mm, I might *have done that*… once or twice or more. +
M: We’ll have to ask him, I’m sure he has. Alright, so, that’s what it means, you force someone to leave the house, leave the class, leave the bed. +
E: So, kicked out of a class, kicked out of the house, kicked out of bed. +

M: Exactly, great! Let’s look at our third word now – _creeped (v.)爬行；蔓延；慢慢地移动；起鸡皮疙瘩 me out_ 使我毛骨悚然；让我感到害怕. +
E: Creeped me out. +
M: Creeped me out. +
E: Creeped me out. +
M: Now, this is a really common phrase. +
E: I like this phrase a lot 我非常喜欢这个短语 /and we’ve got some examples for you to listen to, to help you understand this word a little bit better. +

Voice: Example one. +
A: Schhh, did you hear that? I think I saw something. +
B: Stop it! You are really creeping me out! +

Voice: Example two. +
C: This place really creeps me out. Let’s get out of here! +

M: Alright, well, I have a confession 坦白；供认 to make – I’m kind of creeped out by clowns 小丑. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.clown
-> 可能来自clod,大块，笨拙。
====

E: You are?  真的吗？ +
M: Yes! I don’t know, they’re just creepy 令人毛骨悚然的；吓人的, they’re… they scare me, I don’t know. +
E: Really? +
M: Yeah, so… +
E: *What is it* about clowns *that* scare you so much? +

[.my2]
小丑哪点让你这么害怕呀？

M: I don’t know /they’re just… white faces and weird paint (油漆，涂料；绘画颜料)奇怪的妆容… I don’t know /it’s just creepy… And the way they laugh 笑；发笑, oh, I don’t know, no… +
E: Maybe, you had a bad experience with clowns as a child. +
M: Probably, I watched a scary movie about clowns or something. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Alright. +
E: So, _creeped me out_ basically means “made me feel uncomfortable”. +
M: Yes, it scares you. +

E: Yeah, well, speaking of 说起，提到 _being scared_, we have our final word for language takeaway /and it is _scared the heck out of me_. +
M: You scared the heck out of me. 把我吓得够呛；吓死我了 +
E: Scared the heck out of me. +
M: You got really scared. +
E: Yeah, I think this is a quite common way of saying “You really, really scared me!” +
M: Yeah, okay, we’re ready to listen to our dialogue again. Now, try and see if you can catch all these phrases that we just talked about. +

\... +
\... +
\... +

E: You know, `主` one of the things I really like about this dialogue `系` is /there’s a lot of great phrases that will help you to gossip. +
M: That’s a good observation 观察；发现, so, I think it’s time for “fluency builder”. +

Voice: Fluency builder. +
E: In fluency builder /we take a simple phrase or a simple word you already know /and show you how to express the same idea a little bit more naturally. +
M: Okay, great, so, let’s take a look at our first item for fluency builder. +
E: So, when you gossip with somebody, you often tell them news or information that they don’t know already. And you might start by saying “Did you know that”. +
M: Or you can say “Did you hear”. +
E: Yeah, both of those phrases are perfectly fine, but if you wanna sound a little bit more native-like /when you’re gossiping, you might try out this phrase from the dialogue…

Phrase 1: I don’t know if you’ve heard… I don’t know if you’ve heard… +
M: Yeah, that’s a really good phrase. You’re saying exactly the same thing, but in a really natural way. +
E: It’s a great one for gossiping, so, Marco, I don’t know if you’ve heard, but ChinesePod is *up to* 正在忙于（做某事）,正在搞（某事）,正打算做（某事） some pretty crazy things.  +

[.my2]
但是ChinesePod做了一些非常疯狂的事情。 +
《中文播客》最近在搞些挺有意思的活动呢。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.up to
这里的 ​​“up to”​​ 是一个​​动词短语（phrasal verb）​​，意思是：
​​“正在忙于（做某事）”；“正在搞（某事）”；“正打算做（某事）”​​ +
它通常带有一种​​秘密、神秘、可疑或令人惊讶​​的意味，*暗示所做的事情可能不寻常、有点出格或非常有趣。*

“up to” 的其他常见用法和含义 +
这个短语的具体含义需要根据上下文来判断：

[.my3]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a,1a"]

|含义|例句|上下文与情感

|忙于（做），搞（什么事）​​ （​​即你句子中的用法​​）
|What are you ​​*up to*​​?​​ （你​​在搞​​什么名堂呢？）
|中性或略带怀疑，常用问候语

为什么用“up to”？
====

M: Hehe. See, that’s exactly how you would use that phrase. So, now let’s take a look at our second item. Now, when you’re gossiping, you want information. +
E: That’s right, so, you might say “Oh, tell me about it”. +
M: Or something like “Give me the details 细节；详情”. +
E: Yeah, and again both of these examples are perfectly fine, but when you’re gossiping, you might wanna try something like this…

Phrase 2: #You have to fill me in#. 你得跟我详细说说. You have to fill me in. +
M: Fill me in 跟我详细说, yeah, that’s… that’s what I would say “Fill me in”, you know, give me the details. Fill me in. +
E: *Fill me in* on today’s gossip. +

M: Okay, so, let’s take a look at our third item. Now, if you have some juicy 多汁的，有趣的；刺激的（尤指涉及他人隐私的） gossiping news… +
E: And you wanna *start up* a conversation, you might use this phrase here… +

Phrase 3: Well, you’ll never guess /what I saw this morning. Well, you’ll never guess what I saw this morning.  +
M: That’s a really good phrase. You can change it a little bit. You can say _you’ll never guess who I saw_. +
E: Or _you’ll never guess what I heard_. +
M: Exactly, and… +
E: Very excellent gossip phrases. +
M: Hehe. We’re teaching you how to gossip, because that’s real English. +
E: People really do it. See, you got another language  for it. +
M: Hehe. +
E: Alright, so, enough of our gossip 闲话说够了. I think it’s time for us to listen to the dialogue one last time. +

\... +
\... +
\... +

E: Okay, Marco, I have a true story for you. +
M: Is it _kind of like_ 有点像，有几分相似 a creepy story? 是不是有点像恐怖故事？ +
E: It is a creepy story indeed. +
M: Is it a true story? +
E: No, it’s really true. +
M: Okay. +
E: So, when I was young /I used to live in a countryside 农村；乡下. +
M: Uhu. +
E: And, you know, in a countryside /all of the neighbors know each other. It’s a small community 社区；社群, so, everyone knows what’s happening all the time. +
M: Okay. +
E: And there was some gossip going  on _in our community_ about a guy who lived at the end of the road. +
M: Uhu. +
E: And he was the owner of a _car wrecking 破坏，毁灭 yard_ (（某种用途的）区域，场地) 汽车拆解厂（专门回收报废汽车并拆解零件出售的场所）, so, a place where you take _old broken-down 故障的；衰弱的 cars_ /and *take* the parts *apart* /to sell (v.) 把零件拆开卖. +
M: Right… +
E: And anyway… 然后呢 +
M: A _scrap （纸、布等的）碎片，小块；丝毫，一丁点；废品，废弃材料 yard_ 废品场；废料场. +

[.my2]
也就是废品场是吧

E: Yeah, a scrap yard. +
M: Alright. +
E: Okay, so, you know, he had a wife and a couple of kids, um, and suddenly his wife disappeared 消失；不见. +
M: Wow. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Hehe. +
E: And no one knew what happened or anything /and, so, several years  passed /and suddenly the police start coming in /and start investigating this guy /and start digging up 挖掘；挖开（地面等） all of the land around his property 房产；地产. And I guess… I don’t know what they’re doing, but I think they were looking for the wife’s body 尸体. +
M: Wow, and did they find it? +
E: I don’t know, I moved away. +
M: Hehe. Oh, such a great story, but we don’t know how it ends. +
E: Yeah, well, um… +
M: But we could *leave it up 交由某人决定或处理 to* the imagination 想象；想象力 of our listeners. +
E: Exactly. +
M: Maybe they were looking for an old car. +
E: An old car very underground 在地下；埋在地下. I don’t think so. +

[.my2]
找一辆埋在地下很深的旧汽车？我觉得不太可能。

M: Hehe. Alright, that’s a true story, real English, real stories ??? +
E: You heard it first here /on EnglishPod. +

M: Here. Alright, so, we wanna hear your comments 评论；意见 and suggestions about this topic. I bet 我敢打赌  /a lot of our listeners also have creepy stories, maybe good stories, maybe… I don’t know, different types of, uh, weird stories, so, you guys should definitely log on 登录（网站、系统等） to EnglishPod /and share them with us. +
E: That’s right, go to englishpod.com /and in the comment section 评论区 of the website /tell us your creepy stories. +
M: And we’re gonna *pick out* 挑选；选出 the best story *as* the story of the week. +

[.my2]
我们会选出最精彩的故事，评为 “本周最佳故事”。

E: We’ll announce 宣布；公布 it /in our _This Just In_ 刚刚收到的消息,突发快讯 podcast. +

[.my2]
我们会在《突发快讯》（This Just In）播客节目里公布结果。

M: Yes, so, we wanna hear all your juicy stories /and gossip maybe as well +

[.my1]
.案例
====
....and gossip maybe as well
这句话的结构可以理解为：​​“...and (maybe) gossip as well”​​ +
意思是：​​“……以及（或许）还有一些八卦。”​
====

E: Yes. +
M: Hehe. +
E: Hehe. +
M: Alright, well, it’s time for us to go, so, be sure to listen to us next time, but until then it’s… +
E: Bye-bye! +
M: Bye! +

M: Hello everyone! And welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. +
E: And I’m Erica. +
M: And today with Erica we have an upper intermediate lesson. +
E: That’s right, an upper intermediate lesson that’s a little bit strange. +
M: It’s a little bit strange, but it’s a real English lesson, because that’s what we give you 
here at EnglishPod. +
E: So, in today’s lesson we’ve got a lot of really great language for you, we’ve got language 
to help you to gossip better. +
M: Gossip! Why don’t you, ah, explain it a little bit just in case? +
E: Okay, so, if I gossip, I maybe share news or information about other people with my 
friends. Like I might say something like “Marco, did you see what happened in ChinesePod
today? You’ll never guess what I saw!” +
M: Exactly, that’s gossip and we also have language today to describe things. +
E: To describe strange things. +
M: Strange things. Alright, so, let’s take a look at our “vocabulary preview”. +
Voice: Vocabulary preview. +
E: So, on our vocabulary preview we’ll look at a few important words that will help you to 
understand the dialogue a little bit better. +
M: Exactly, and the first word is weird. +
E: Weird. +
M: Weird. +
E: Weird. +
M: Now, this is a common word you probably hear all the time in a lot of different 
satiations, so, we wanna to explain it today. +
E: Yeah, uh, this word just means strange. +
M: It’s strange. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Weird person is a strange person. +
E: Exactly, but the thing about this word is if you are a young person, let’s say under the 
age of thirty five (35), you’ll probably use it about a hundred times a day. +
M: Hehe. Weird. +
E: Yeah. +
M: It’s just such a good sounding word – weird. +
E: It is. +
M: Okay, but the thing is that even though that it’s probably more commonly used in 
American English, it’s still widely used for British English as well. +
E: Yeah, that’s true. +
M: So, but maybe in British English you would say something like… +
E: Odd. +
M: It’s odd. +
E: Yeah. +
M: That’s more common. Okay, let’s look at our second word – housewarming gift. +
E: Housewarming gift. +
M: Housewarming gift. +
E: Housewarming gift. +
M: Now, this is a cultural thing, it’s really common in North America to give a housewarming 
gift to someone. +
E: Yeah, if I move into a new house, maybe some of my friends or a family will bring a gift 
over to make my house a little bit more beautiful. +
M: So, something like a photo frame or… +
E: Or maybe a plant or sometimes even like maybe a basket of pastries or something. +
M: Okay, well… +
E: Yeah. +
M: I’ve never gotten one of those… +
E: Really? +
M: Cause I don’t have a home. +
E: Oh… +
M: Hehe. +
E: Where do you live? On a street? +
M: Well, I don’t have a… uh, my own home, so, I have never gotten one of those. +
E: Okay. +
M: Okay, so, we’re ready now to listen to our dialogue. +
E: So, we’ve got two housewives who are gossiping about what’s going on in a 
neighborhood and let’s listen to what happens. +
A: Oh, I don’t know if you heard, but someone moved
into that old house down the road. +
B: Yeah, I know. I met the owner of the house yes-
terday as he was moving in. His name is Armand. +
A: Really? What’s he like? You have to fill me in. +
B: Actually, he’s a bit strange. I don’t know... I’ve got
a bad feeling about him. +
A: Really? Why? +
B: Well, yesterday I brought over a housewarming
gift, but Armand started acting really weird, and
then he practically kicked me out! I tried to, sort of,
peek into his house, but everything was so dark
inside that I couldn’t really get a good look. +
A: Well, you’ll never guess what I saw this morn-
ing. A delivery truck pulled into his driveway, and
it dropped off a long, rectangular box. It almost
looked like a coffin! +
B: You see! Why would he... +
C: Hello ladies... +
B: Ah, Armand! You scared the heck out of me! This
is my friend Doris. +
C: A pleasure to meet you...If you are not doing any-
thing tonight, I would like to have you both for din-
ner. I mean...I would like to have you both over for
dinner.
 
E: Ooh, that guy seems kind of weird. +
M: Hehe. You can hear his voice is like a weird guy, right? +
E: Yeah. +
M: Hehe. Alright, let’s take a look at our “language takeaway” and look at some of these 
great words. +
Voice: Language takeaway. +
E: So, our language takeaway focuses on several words from the dialogue that we feel are 
really important for you to know. +
M: Exactly and we have four of them for you today. Why don’t we look at the first one? +
E: Okay, so, the first word is a bad feeling. +
M: Bad feeling. +
E: A bad feeling. +
M: A bad feeling. +
E: So, we’ve got a few examples that will you to understand how this phrase works. +
Voice: Example one. +
A: I don’t like Kelly’s new boyfriend. I’ve got a bad feeling about him. +
Voice: Example two. +
B: It’s so dark. We shouldn’t be up here. I’ve got a bad feeling about this. +
Voice: Example three. +
C: I’ve got a bad feeling about this trip. I feel like something is going to happen. Maybe we 
shouldn’t go. +
M: Okay, so, basically you think something bad is gonna happen. +
E: Yeah, you have a… soft of uncomfortable feeling. +
M: Okay, that makes sense. I have a bad feeling about something. +
E: Exactly. +
M: Okay, let’s look at our second word now – kicked me out. +
E: Kicked me out. +
M: Kicked m out. +
E: Kicked me out. +
M: So, when someone kicks you out, it’s they force you to leave. You don’t want to leave, 
but they force you to leave. +
E: Yeah, Marco, have you ever kicked someone out of you class? +
M: Um, yes, I have, I’ve kicked… +
E: Really? +
M: Yeah, if you misbehave in my class, you’re kicked out. +
E: It’s you’re pretty strict, ha? +
M: Hehe. Sometimes I am. +
E: Okay. +
M: Um, okay also maybe you’ve kicked your husband out of bed. +
E: Mm, I might have done that… once or twice or more. +
M: We’ll have to ask him, I’m sure he has. Alright, so, that’s what it means, you force 
someone to leave the house, leave the class, leave the bed. +
E: So, kicked out of a class, kicked out of the house, kicked out of bed. +
M: Exactly, great! Let’s look at our third word now – creeped me out. +
E: Creeped me out. +
M: Creeped me out. +
E: Creeped me out. +
M: Now, this is a really common phrase. +
E: I like this phrase a lot and we’ve got some examples for you to listen to, to help you 
understand this word a little bit better. +
Voice: Example one. +
A: Schhh, did you hear that? I think I saw something. +
B: Stop it! You are really creeping me out! +
Voice: Example two. +
C: This place really creeps me out. Let’s get out of here! +
M: Alright, well, I have a confession to make – I’m kind of creeped out by clowns. +
E: You are? +
M: Yes! I don’t know, they’re just creepy, they’re… they scare me, I don’t know. +
E: Really? +
M: Yeah, so… +
E: What is it about clowns that scare you so much? +
M: I don’t know there’re just… white faces and weird paint… I don’t know it’s just creepy… 
And the way the laugh, oh, I don’t know, no… +
E: Maybe, you had a bad experience with clowns as a child. +
M: Probably, I watched a scary movie about clowns or something. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Alright. +
E: So, creeped me out basically means “made me feel uncomfortable”. +
M: Yes, it scares you. +
E: Yeah, well, speaking of being scared, we have our final word for language takeaway and 
it is scared the heck out of me. +
M: You scared the heck out of me. +
E: Scared the heck out of me. +
M: You got really scared. +
E: Yeah, I think this is a quite common way of saying “You really, really scared me!” +
M: Yeah, okay, we’re ready to listen to our dialogue again. Now, try and see if you can 
catch all these phrases that we just talked about. +
A: Oh, I don’t know if you heard, but someone moved 
into that old house down the road. +
B: Yeah, I know. I met the owner of the house yes- 
terday as he was moving in. His name is Armand. +
A: Really? What’s he like? You have to fill me in. +
B: Actually, he’s a bit strange. I don’t know... I’ve got 
a bad feeling about him. +
A: Really? Why? +
B: Well, yesterday I brought over a housewarming 
gift, but Armand started acting really weird, and
then he practically kicked me out! I tried to, sort of,
peek into his house, but everything was so dark
inside that I couldn’t really get a good look. +
A: Well, you’ll never guess what I saw this morn- 
ing. A delivery truck pulled into his driveway, and
it dropped off a long, rectangular box. It almost
looked like a coffin! +
B: You see! Why would he... +
C: Hello ladies... +
B: Ah, Armand! You scared the heck out of me! This 
is my friend Doris. +
C: A pleasure to meet you...If you are not doing any- 
thing tonight, I would like to have you both for din-
ner. I mean...I would like to have you both over for
dinner.
 
E: You know, one of the things I really like about this dialogue is there’s a lot of great 
phrases that will help you to gossip. +
M: That’s a good observation, so, I think it’s time for “fluency builder”. +
Voice: Fluency builder. +
E: In fluency builder we take a simple phrase or a simple word you already know and show 
you how to express the same idea a little bit more naturally. +
M: Okay, great, so, let’s take a look at our first item for fluency builder. +
E: So, when you gossip with somebody, you often tell them news or information that they 
don’t know already. And you might start by saying “Did you know that”. +
M: Or you can say “Did you hear”. +
E: Yeah, both of those phrases are perfectly fine, but if you wanna sound a little bit more 
native-like when you’re gossiping, you might try out this phrase from the dialogue…
Phrase 1: I don’t know if you’ve heard… I don’t know if you’ve heard… +
M: Yeah, that’s a really good phrase. You’re saying exactly the same thing, but in a really 
natural way. +
E: It’s a great one for gossiping, so, Marco, I don’t know if you’ve heard, but 
ChinesePod is up to some pretty crazy things. +
M: Hehe. See, that’s exactly how you would use that phrase. So, now let’s take a look at 
our second item. Now, when you’re gossiping, you want information. +
E: That’s right, so, you might say “Oh, tell me about it”. +
M: Or something like “Give me the details”. +
E: Yeah, and again both of these examples are perfectly fine, but when you’re gossiping, 
you might wanna try something like this…
Phrase 2: You have to fill me in. You have to fill me in. +
M: Fill me in, yeah, that’s… that’s what I would say “Fill me in”, you know, give me the 
details. Fill me in. +
E: Fill me in on today’s gossip. +
M: Okay, so, let’s take a look at our third item. Now, if you have some juicy gossiping 
news… +
E: And you wanna start up a conversation, you might use this phrase here… 
Phrase 2: Well, you’ll never guess what I saw this morning. Well, you’ll never guess what I
saw this morning. +
M: That’s a really good phrase. You can change it a little bit. You can say you’ll never 
guess who I saw. +
E: Or you’ll never guess what I heard. +
M: Exactly, and… +
E: Very excellent gossip phrases. +
M: Hehe. We’re teaching you how to gossip, because that’s real English. +
E: People really do it. See, you got another langue for it. +
M: Hehe. +
E: Alright, so, enough of our gossip. I think it’s time for us to listen to the dialogue one last 
time. +
A: Oh, I don’t know if you heard, but someone moved 
into that old house down the road. +
B: Yeah, I know. I met the owner of the house yes- 
terday as he was moving in. His name is Armand. +
A: Really? What’s he like? You have to fill me in. +
B: Actually, he’s a bit strange. I don’t know... I’ve got 
a bad feeling about him. +
A: Really? Why? +
B: Well, yesterday I brought over a housewarming 
gift, but Armand started acting really weird, and
then he practically kicked me out! I tried to, sort of,
peek into his house, but everything was so dark
inside that I couldn’t really get a good look. +
A: Well, you’ll never guess what I saw this morn- 
ing. A delivery truck pulled into his driveway, and
it dropped off a long, rectangular box. It almost
looked like a coffin! +
B: You see! Why would he... +
C: Hello ladies... +
B: Ah, Armand! You scared the heck out of me! This 
is my friend Doris. +
C: A pleasure to meet you...If you are not doing any- 
thing tonight, I would like to have you both for din-
ner. I mean...I would like to have you both over for
dinner.
 
E: Okay, Marco, I have a true story for you. +
M: Is it kind like a creepy story? +
E: It is a creepy story indeed. +
M: Is it a true story? +
E: No, it’s really true. +
M: Okay. +
E: So, when I was young I used to live in a country. +
M: Uhu. +
E: And, you know, in a country all of the neighbors know each other. It’s a small 
community, so, everyone knows what’s happening all the time. +
M: Okay. +
E: And there was some gossip going on in our community about a guy who lived at the end 
of the road. +
M: Uhu. +
E: And he was the owner of a car wrecking yard, so, a place where you take old broken- 
down cars and take the parts apart to sell. +
M: Right… +
E: And anyway… +
M: A scrap yard. +
E: Yeah, a scrap yard. +
M: Alright. +
E: Okay, so, you know, he had a wife and a couple of kids, um, and suddenly his wife 
disappeared. +
M: Wow. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Hehe. +
E: And no one knew what happened or anything and, so, several passed and suddenly the 
police start coming in and start investigating this guy and start digging up all of the land
around his property. And I guess… I don’t know what they’re doing, but I think they were
looking for the wife’s body. +
M: Wow, and did they find it? +
E: I don’t know, I moved away. +
M: Hehe. Oh, such a great story, but we don’t know how it ends. +
E: Yeah, well, um… +
M: But we could leave it up to the imagination of our listeners. +
E: Exactly. +
M: Maybe they were looking for an old car. +
E: An old car very underground. I don’t think so. +
M: Hehe. Alright, that’s a true story, real English, real stories ??? +
E: You heard it first here on EnglishPod. +
