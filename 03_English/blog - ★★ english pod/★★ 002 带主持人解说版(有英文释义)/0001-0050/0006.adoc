M: Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. +
E: And I’m Erica. +
M: How are you, Erica? +
E: Marco, I’m doing really well 我挺好的! How about you? +
M: I’m doing great 我非常好! I’m really excited, because today we’re talking about travel. +
E: That’s right, we’re gonna give you some real English 地道的英语表达 to talk about travel.

[.my2]
我们会教大家一些谈论旅行时能用到的 “实用英语”。 +

M: Exactly, English that you would use in everyday life, that you hear in movies, in TV
shows. +
E: English people actually use. +
M: Exactly, so, why don’t you tell us a little bit about this lesson for today? +
E: Okay, so, today we are going to listen `主` as a husband and wife `谓` get ready to go on a trip. +
M: Alright, that sounds a little bit complicated. +

[.my2]
Marco 是在用一种​​幽默、调侃​​的语气指出“夫妻共同准备旅行”这件事可能不会那么顺利，会有些“麻烦”或“复杂”的情况发生。

E: Aha. +
M: Hehe. +
E: Well, let’s look at our two preview words 预习词汇. +
Voice: Vocabulary preview. +
M: Okay, so, the first word that we have is _road trip_ 公路旅行. +
E: Road trip. +
M: Road trip. +
E: Road trip. +
M: Okay, so, road trips are really fun and interesting, right? +
E: Road trips are great. You *get to* 获得机会,享有特权 get in a car with your family /and drive on a vacation 开车去度假. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.You get to get in a car...
​​*get to*​​ 是一个非常重要的口语表达，**它传递了一种​​“获得机会”或“享有特权”​​的积极含义，**而不仅仅是字面上的“得到”。 +
“You get to get in a car...”​​ 的意思是：
​​“你（有幸）可以和家人一起坐上车……”​​ 或 ​​“你得到了一个（和家人一起开车度假的）机会”​​。

- I ​​get to​​ travel to Paris for work. (我​​有幸能​​去巴黎出差。) -> 这是一件美差。

为什么这里用“get to”？​​
说话者想表达的是，公路旅行不仅仅是一个动作，更是一种​​独特的体验和享受​​：
它意味着​​冒险、自由和家庭时光​​。
====


M: Yeah, that was a really fun /and they’re really popular in North America. +
E: Really popular. I’ve been on a million road trips 我自驾游过无数次了,我已经去过无数次公路旅行了. +

M: Hehe, Alright, we’ll talk about that /a little bit later on, but now let’s *take a look at* our
second word /and it’s the car’s packed 车装满了. +
E: The car is packed 挤满人的，非常拥挤的；充满的，装满的；收拾妥当的. +
M: The car’s packed. +
E: The car is packed. +
M: So, when your car is packed /it means that… +
E: Everything you need is inside the car. +
M: Alright, so, your bags, your food, everything that you need for your trip. +
E: Exactly. +
M: Perfect! Okay, so, those were our two preview words /and now we are ready to listen to
the dialogue for the first time. +
E: Okay, this dialogue will be at normal speed, it will be fast, but don’t worry if you don’t 
understand everything. +

[.my2]
这段对话会用正常语速播放，速度会比较快，

M: After ten minutes /we promise 承诺，保证 you will understand everything in this lesson. +

|A: So, are we all ready to go? +
B: Yup, I think so. The car’s packed; we have
munchies 小点心 and music, and the map’s in the car. +
A: Did you get the camera? +
B: Got it! Did you fill up the tank? +
A: Yup, it’s all set 都准备好了. +
B: You’re sure we’re not forgetting anything? +
A: I’m sure... we’ve got all our bases covered. +


[.my1]
.案例
====
.All our bases covered
是一个惯用表达，意思是“我们已经面面俱到”或“所有方面都考虑到了”。它源自棒球术语，指的是确保所有垒位都被防守到位，以防对手得分。
====

B: Well… let’s get going then! I love road trips! +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.let’s get going then!
“*get going*”是一个短语动词，表示“*开始行动；出发*”。

*不能去掉get,* 因为“let’s going then!”在语法上是不正确的。**“let's”是一个固定短语，其后需要动词原形。**而不是动词的进行时态。因此, 你只能说成 “let’s go then!”或者“let’s get going then!”。

两者的区别是:
虽然“let’s *go* then!”和“let’s *get going* then!”在意思上非常接近，都表示“让我们出发吧”。 但是:

- “let’s *get going* then!”在语气上可能**稍微##更加强调“开始行动”的动态感，##更具有一种推动力。**
- “let's *go*” *只是单纯的走，出发。*

即 “let's get going” 更加强调"开始行动"的这个过程。
====

B: Um... do you think we can make a _pit stop_ （旅途中的）加油、进食、休息或使用洗手间的停留；暂时偏离直接或通常路线的停留? +
A: But we’ve only been on the road for ten minutes. +
B: I know, but I forgot to go to the bathroom 室，盥洗室；<美>卫生间，厕所 before
we left.

[.my2]
我出发前忘了上厕所了
|===


 
E: Well, she forgot to go to the bathroom. +
M: Yeah, I hate it /when this happens. +
E: This happens to me /on almost every road trip. +
M: Hehe. Okay, great, so, now it’s time for our “language takeaway 外卖；带走的东西”. We have three
words for our _language takeaway_ today. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Language takeaway
“Language takeaway”​​ 是英语教学节目（尤其是播客或视频）中一个非常常见的环节名称。它的意思不能直接从字面理解，而是一个​​比喻​​。 +

*Takeaway (外卖；带走的东西)​. 在这里，它比喻： +
•​​就像你从餐厅打包带走的食物一样​​，这个环节是为你精心准备的、可以让你“打包带走”的知识。* +
•
这些是你学完这节课后，​​最应该记住、最能在未来使用的“干货”​​。

所以，​​“Language Takeaway”​​ = ​​可以“打包带走”的语言干货​​。 +
“Language takeaway”​​ 指的是：
​​“本课的语言要点”​​ 或 ​​“今天要带你掌握的核心语言知识”​​。

你可以把这些表达理解为“Language Takeaway”的同义词或解释： +
•​​Key Vocabulary​​ （核心词汇） +
•​​Vocabulary Builder​​ （词汇构建） +
•​​Words to Learn​​ （待学单词） +
•​​Today’s Key Terms​​ （今日关键术语） +
====

Voice: Language takeaway. +
E: And the first word is munchies 小点心. +
M: Munchies. +
E: Munchies. +
M: So, munchies are… +
E: Snacks 小吃；快餐；零嘴. +
M: Snacks, food. +
E: Food, chips. +
M: Chips, cookies. +
E: Chocolate bars. +
M: All that good stuff. +
E: I love munchies. +
M: Hehe. And they’re really good /when you’re taking a road trip. +
E: Indeed. +

M: Okay, so, let’s take a look at our second _language takeaway word_ for today /and it is _fill
up the tank_ 给油箱加满油. +
E: Fill up the tank. +
M: Fill up the tank. +
E: Fill up the tank. So, this is to… +
M: Put gas in your car. +
E: Put gas in the gas tank. +
M: In the gas tank, exactly. +

E: Alright, our last _language takeaway_ today is… +
M: Pit stop （长途旅行中的）短暂休息，歇脚;停车加油（或修理等）. +
E: Pit stop. +
M: Pit stop. +
E: Make a pit stop. +
M: It’s a quick stop /for you to get some gas, food, go to the bathroom. +
E: Yeah, a pit stop, a quick stop 短暂停留一下. +

M: Great, so, now it’s time for “Putting it together” 把它组合起来. +
Voice: Putting it together. +
M: Okay, so, we have two great phrases for you today. Let’s take a look at the first one. +
E: We’ve got all our bases 基地 covered 我们已经把所有该准备的,都准备好了. +
M: We’ve got all our bases covered. +
E: We’ve got all our bases covered. +
M: This is a really great phrase /and it’s really useful, right? +
E: Yeah, let’s listen to a couple of examples. +

Voice: Example one. +
A: We’ve got all our bases covered /in case the hurricane (n.)飓风；爆发 hits 飓风袭击. +

Voice: Example two. +
B: Okay, I have my keys, wallet and passport. *Looks like* I have all my bases covered. +

M: Okay, it’s clear now, but you can use this /in a lot of different situations, right? +
E: You can use this /in many situations. If I’m at work /I could say “Alright, we’ve got _a really
good marketing plan_, we’ve got all our bases covered”. +

[.my2]
我们有一个非常棒的营销计划（marketing plan），所有细节都考虑到了.

M: Exactly, you have everything ready. +
E: You’re all prepared. +
M: Perfect! Alright, now let’s take a look at our second phrase /and it’s _let’s get going_ 我们出发吧; 我们开始吧. +
E: Let’s get going. +
M: Let’s get going. +
E: Let’s get going. +
M: Alright, so, when you say “Let’s get going” /it just means… +
E: Let’s start. +
M: Let’s start, let’s go. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Okay, but the interesting thing about this phrase is /you can change (v.) it a little bit /and it
means something different. +
E: Aha, let’s listen to a couple of examples. +

Voice: Example one. +
A: I have the chicken 鸡；鸡肉, so, let’s get cooking. +

[.my2]
我把鸡肉准备好了，那我们开始做饭吧。


Voice: Example two. +
B: This house is really scary 真得吓人. Let’s get out of here! +

Voice: Example three. +
C: I have another meeting in twenty minutes, so, let’s *get down to business* 开始认真做事;开始谈正事 . +

E: So, let’s get down to business, Marco. +
M: Let’s get down to business, let’s listen to the dialogue one more time, but this time… +
E: It’ll be a little bit slower /and you’ll understand much better. +

A: But we’ve only been on the road for ten minutes. +
B: I know, but I forgot to go to the bathroom before

E: So, that was a little more clear this time, wasn’t it? +
M: Yeah, you can definitely understand better about… /what we’ve been talking about. +
E: Yep. +
M: Okay, so, now it’s time to look at “fluency builder 流利度构建环节,提升表达流畅度的练习,流利表达训练”. Erica, why don’t you explain what
fluency builder is? +

[.my2]
你给大家解释一下什么是 “流利表达训练” 吧？

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Fluency Builder
指的是：
​​“流利度构建环节”​​ 或 ​​“提升表达流畅度的练习”​​。
这个环节的​​目的不是​​教你新的单词（那是 ​​“Language Takeaway”​​ 环节的任务），而是教你​​如何将已知的词汇和语法组合成更地道、更自然、更流畅的短语和句子​​，从而让你听起来更像母语者。


Fluency (流利度)​​ +
Builder (构建者/构建器)​​：这里意为 ​​“帮助你构建…的工具/环节”​​。 +
所以 ​​Fluency Builder​​ = ​​帮助你构建语言流利度的工具/环节​​。
====

E: In fluency builder /we give you some great useful phrases /to help you express your ideas
clearly. +
M: Okay, great, so, let’s look at fluency builder. +
Voice: Fluency builder. +
E: Alright, so, we all know /how to ask the question “Are we ready to go?” +
M: That’s right, you can say “#Can we go now?#” +
E: Or you can say “#Are we ready to go?#” +
M: Exactly, but there’s another way that we can say this /and we heard it in our dialogue,
so, let’s listen.

Phrase 1: #So, are we all ready to go?# So, are we all ready to go? +

E: Wow! That sounds really good, it sounds a lot more fluent 听起来流利多了. +
M: Fluent, exactly. +
E: Yeah. Okay, so, `主` another simple phrase _that we all know how to say_ 还有一个我们都知道怎么说的简单短语 `系` is “#It is ready# 准备好了”. +
M: It is prepared. +
E: It is ready. +
M: Right. +
E: So, these examples are fine, they’re right. 这些表达都没问题，是正确的。 +
M: Uhu. Yeah, they’re correct English, no problem. +
E: But there’s another way to say this /that we heard in the dialogue /and it sounds a lot
more fluent.

Phrase 1: #Yep, it’s all set# （嗯，都准备好了。）. Yep, it’s all set. +

E: It’s all set, that sounds much better. +
M: Yes, and *we’re all set* 都准备好了 to listen to this dialogue for a third time /and this time it’s gonna be
at its normal speed. +

M: So, Erica, you said you’ve been on a million road trips, what was that all about 具体是怎么回事呀? Where
have you been? +
E: Okay, well, maybe not a million road trips. 其实可能没 “无数次” 那么多啦。 +
M: Hehe. +
E: But many road trips 但确实去过很多次. Every summer /I used *to go on a road trip* with my family /and we
would drive many many hours, probably eight hours in one day /*up to* Northern Canada 一直开到加拿大北部. +
M: Oh, wow! Nice. +
E: Yeah, and then we would go camping 去露营 /and we would sleep outside /and we would have a
campfire at night, it was great. +
M: Oh, family road trip. +
E: Yeah, but maybe eight hours in a car is a little too long. +
M: Well, yeah. Well, I’ve been on a different kind of road trip /with _some_, uh, _buddies of
mine_, some friends. We would drive to Las Vegas. +
E: Really? +
M: Yeah, so, that’s really fun – a bunch of crazy guys in a car /going to Las Vegas /and then
just having fun 享受自己；体验愉快的活动,玩得开心 /and talking about everything, so, that’s a much different experience *than* a
family road trip. +
E: Maybe that sounds (v.) a little bit more fun.

[.my2]
听起来好像更有意思一点呢。 +

M: Hehe. Yeah, eight hours in a car is not really that boring (v.) /with all your friends. Alright,
folks, we’re out of time for today, but be sure to visit our website at englishpod.com /and
leave all your questions and comments. +

[.my2]
是啊，和朋友们一起的话，即使在车里待八个小时也不会觉得无聊。

E: Okay, well, thanks for listening /and *until next time* 下次再见,直到下一次… Good bye! +
M: Bye! +
