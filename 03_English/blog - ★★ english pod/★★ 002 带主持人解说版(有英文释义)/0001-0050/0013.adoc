== 中文释义

E: Hello everyone! And welcome to EnglishPod! My name’s Erica. +
M: And I’m Marco. +
E: So, Marco, how’re you doing today? +
M: I’m great! I’m really happy to be back, ready to deliver 提供；交付 another great podcast for all our listeners. +
E: That’s right! And we’ve got an intermediate 中级的；中等水平的 lesson today about _spending money_. +
M: Yeah, specifically 具体地；专门地, spending money in a company. +
E: That’s right, we’re going to be listening to a business meeting 商务会议 /as a company describes (v.) how they’re spending money. +
M: Right, and they’re actually looking at their _profit and loss statement_ 损益表, so… +
E: Okay. +
M: That’s kind of interesting. +

E: Well, Marco, can you tell us a little bit about a _profit and loss statement_? +
M: Uh, yeah, sure! Well, all companies *come out with* 推出；发布;出版;供应，把……投入市场 a _profit and loss statement_ every year or every three months /and it’s basically a document that shows all the money _that the company is spending_ /and all the money _that the company is earning_ 赚取；获得. +
E: So, it’s a document that outlines (v.)概述；列出 /how much money the company makes /and how much it… it spends. +
M: Right, so, in the end 最终, basically, it’ll tell you we’re making money /or we’re losing money 亏损. +
E: Okay, so, we’re gonna be listening to, uh, some people discuss (v.) a _profit and loss statement_ in just a moment 马上. But before we do that, it’s time for “vocabulary preview 词汇预习”. +

Voice: Vocabulary preview. +
M: Okay, great! So, today on our vocabulary preview /we have two words for you, so, let’s take a look at the first one. +
E: Expenses 开销；花费. +
M: Expenses. +
E: Expenses. +
M: Expenses. +
E: So, expenses are things /that you have to spend money on regularly 定期地；经常. +
M: Right, so, for example, in a company /regular company expenses 公司日常开支 are salaries 薪水；工资 or office supplies 办公用品 or the phone bills 电话费, internet bills 网费. +
E: Okay, and maybe in a household 家庭 or a family /`主` your expenses 开支；花费；费用 `系` *might be* your food, perhaps your transportation 交通；出行(费用) or your rent 租金 or your _heating bills_ 取暖费, so, these are all things you *spend money* on regularly. They’re expenses. +

M: Expenses, great! Let’s take a look at our second word – through the roof (极高的；飙升的) 直线上升. +
E: Through the roof. +
M: Through the roof. +
E: Through the roof. +
M: So, when something is _through the roof_, it’s… +
E: Really, really, really, really high. +
M: Really high. Hehe. So, for example, we can talk about gas prices 汽油价格 are _through the roof_ lately. +
E: Yeah, that’s totally true. Gas prices have gone really high /in the past couple of months. +
M: So, when we talk about _through the roof_, it means that /the number  is really high. +
E: That’s right, we typically use this word with numbers. It also gives you the idea /that the number has risen really quickly. +
M: Yeah, exactly! Hehe. +
E: Okay, so, through the roof. +
M: Through the roof. +

E: Alright, Marco, do you think it’s time for the dialogue ? +
M: Yup, let’s listen to the dialogue. As always 像往常一样 /the first dialogue is gonna be a little bit fast, so, it might be a little bit difficult, but… +
E: Don’t worry /if you don’t understand everything, because we will explain all the key language _in a minute_ 在很短的时间内；很快. +

|A: OK, so now /the last point on our agenda 议程. Jill, let’s *go over* 仔细查看；检查;复习 the _profit and loss statement_. +
B: Great. Well, the main issue 问题 here, as you can see, is that /our expenses are _through the roof_. +
A: Let’s see... These numbers are _off the charts_ (图表；排行榜)超出预期;极高的；超出正常范围的! What’s going on 发生什么事了 here! +
B: Well, um, sir, `主` the company expenditures 支出；花费 on entertainment 娱乐 and travel `系` are out of control. Look at these bills for example. Just this month /we’ve paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges 旅馆费! +
A: OK, thank you. I’ll *look into* 调查，研究 it. +
B: The list *goes on and on* 持续不断；没完没了. Here, this is a bill for five thousand dollars for spa treatments 水疗服务! +
A: Thank you; that will be all 这就是全部,就这些了. I’ll take care of 处理，办理 it. +
B: Look at this one /sir, eight thousand dollars were spent in one night at a place called ”Wild Things 狂野事物”?! +
A: OK, I get it 明白了!! Thank you for your very thorough 彻底的；详尽的 analysis!

E: Okay, so, this accountant 会计，会计师, she is, uh, pretty thorough 相当彻底, hey? +
M: Hehe. She’s really persistent (a.)坚持的；执着的 about her job /and the manager apparently is a little bit embarrassed. +
E: Hm, I wonder why that could be. 我想知道为什么会这样 +
M: Hehe. Well, we’ll talk about that _in a little while_ 不久，很快，立刻，马上. Why don’t we take a look at our language takeaway for today? +

Voice: Language takeaway. +
E: In today’s language takeaway /we’re going to look at three words /and the first word is _expenditures_ 开支，[会计]支出. +
M: Expenditures. +
E: Expenditures. +
M: Expenditures. +
E: So, expenditures sounds (v.) pretty close to expenses, right? +
M: It’s pretty similar, but it has a little bit of a difference, so, why don’t we listen to some examples  /and see if we can understand? +

Voice: Example one. +
A: ??? to president (总统，国家主席；总裁；董事长)向总裁汇报 /I will increase (v.) expenditures on health  and education  by twelve per cent (12%). +

Voice: Example two 第二个例子. +
B: We really need to control our travel expenditures 旅游支出. From now on 从现在开始 /all managers will fly (v.)  economy class 经济舱. +

Voice: Example three 第三个例子. +
C: Because of the rise  in oil prices /expenditures on food  are higher than they have ever been. +

E: So, expenditures is the total amount of money /that you’re spending on something. +
M: Right, that’s the total amount of money /versus 与……相对，与……相比 `主` *expenses `系` is the things* that you spend money on. +

[.my2]
它强调的是 “总钱数”，而 “expenses” 指的是 “具体要花钱的项目”。

E: Okay, that’s really clear. +
M: Uhu. +

E: Our next word is _out of control_. +
M: Out of control. +
E: Out of control. +
M: So, when something is out of control, it’s… +
E: It’s crazy. +
M: Crazy, you can’t control it. +
E: Exactly, you can’t stop it. +
M: You can’t stop it, right. +
E: Out of control. +

M: Okay, great! Now, let’s take a look at our last word for today – go over 查看，检查. +
E: Go over. +
M: Go over. +
E: Go over. +
M: So, go over is a pretty simple word. Why don’t we listen to some examples, so we can understand go over? +

Voice: Example one. +
A: I need *to go over this report* one last time 最后一次 to make sure there’re no mistakes. +

Voice: Example two. +
B: Can you help me *go over* my presentation 陈述，报告;演示文稿；展示? I want to make sure it’s perfect. +

Voice: Example three. +
C: Let’s *go over* these numbers one more time /and make sure there’re no mistakes. +

E: Yeah, this is a really common  word /and it basically means “look at carefully”. +
M: Yeah, or review 复习；回顾. +
E: In English /we often find simple little words, they fit together 组合；搭配 really well /and you think “Oh, they’re so easy”. Like the word go, over. So easy. +
M: Hehe. Yeah. +
E: But 强调句 *it’s the way* that they interact with each other 相互作用 *that* makes them… +

[.my2]
但正是这些词的搭配(互动)方式，让它们…

M: Or it makes you sound 听起来 much better. +
E: Exactly, so, *go over* in this case 在此情况下, we might say, um “Let’s go over the lesson”. +
M: Let’s go over the lesson, yeah. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Or… +
E: That sounds great. +
M: Yeah, that’s… and that’s more, uh, natural way of saying something like that. +
E: Okay, so, we’*ve taken look at* our _language takeaways_ for today. I think it’s time to listen to the dialogue one more time. +
M: And this time /the dialogue will be slower, so we can understand and listen to all the words we just talked about. +

\... +
\... +
\... +

E: Okay, so, I got it 我明白了. +
M: Yeah, it’s clear now. +
E: Yeah, and you know, I heard a lot of really great phrases in this dialogue /that I’d like to _at now_ in “fluency builder 流利表达训练”. +

[.my2]
现在咱们就进入 “流利表达训练” 环节

Voice: Fluency builder. +
M: Great, so, today on fluency builder /we have three words for you. Let’s start by looking at the first one – off the charts 超过正常水平,超出预期. +
E: Off the charts. +
M: Off the charts. +
E: Off the charts. +
M: So, this word is very similar to _through the roof_. +
E: Exactly, it also means really high. +
M: Right, so, let’s listen to some examples of how we can use _off the charts_ in a different situation. +

Voice: Example one. +
A: Oil prices have gone up 上涨 /and our costs _are off the charts_. +

Voice: Example two. +
B: Excellent 出色的 job Susan! Your sales 销售额 are _off the charts_ this year. +

Voice: Example three. +
C: Our losses 亏损 are _off the charts_! That’s it! No bonuses 奖金 for anyone! +

E: So, Marco, do you think I can change _off the charts_ for _through the roof_ in these examples? +
M: Yeah, you can. Definitely 肯定地, you can use _off the charts_ or _through the roof_, both of them mean (v.) the same thing. +
E: Okay, so, two ways of saying _really, really, really high_. +
M: Really high. But they’re very commonly used (v.) in a business setting 商务场合. +

E: Yeah, that’s true. Okay, so, this next word is a phrase /that you can use if you want to tell somebody that /you’ll check 查看 something or you’ll investigate something. +
M: Right, and we heard it in our dialogue, so, let’s listen to the clip 片段.

Phrase 1: I’ll *look into* 调查，研究,关注，关心 it. I’ll look into it. +

E: So, look into that /that means I’ll check something. +
M: Yeah, I’ll see what’s happening. +
E: Yeah, does that mean you’re gonna take action 采取行动? +
M: No, it doesn’t. +
E: Okay, so, I think we’ve got another word /that does mean you’re going to take action.

[.my2]
那咱们还有一个短语，它的意思就是 “会采取行动”。

Phrase 2: I’ll *take care of* 处理，办理 it. I’ll take care of it. +
M: So, this word means that /you’re going to do something about it. +
E: I’ll take care of it. I will take responsibility 承担责任. +
M: Exactly, so, I will do something about it. +
E: Yeah. +
M: I will investigate /and I’ll do it. +
E: Yeah, ex… again, two great phrases – I’ll look into it; I’ll take care of it. +

M: Okay, so, now let’s listen to the dialogue a third time. It’s gonna be at its normal speed, but now you have all the tools 后定说明 you need to understand it a lot better. +

[.my2]
但现在你有了更好地理解它所需的所有工具。

\... +
\... +
\... +

E: Well, Marco, I guess one of `主` #the benefits# 福利；好处 of being an executive 高管,主管，经理；行政部门，执行委员会 in a company, especially a large company, `系` #is# you get a lot of amazing 惊人的；出色的 benefits 利益，好处；福利政策；救济金；福利. +
M: Yes, when you are a manger or a CEO of one of these big companies, you get a lot of great things 你会得到很多好东西 like… I don’t know, a private jet 私人飞机, maybe… +
E: Wow, that’s… that’s nice, hey? +
M: Hehe. Or, um, they… um, the company often pays for 支付 your house… +
E: Yeah. +
M: Or for your car, they’ll give you a company car 公司配车. +
E: Uhu. +
M: Um, they’ll pay for your kids or your children’s, uh, tuition 学费 for high school. +
E: So, there’re school fees 学费. +
M: Yeah, yeah. +
E: Okay. +
M: And also I’ve heard about entertainment bonuses 娱乐补贴. +
E: Yeah, so, you can go out to a restaurant 餐厅, get the receipt  发票，收据 and *claim (v.)要求（拥有）；索取；认领;报销 the expenses* 费用,业务费用 at work 工作中. +

[.my2]
就是你去餐厅吃饭，拿了收据之后，可以在公司报销这笔费用。

M: Hah, those are some great benefits, right? +
E: So, Marco, I’m curious 好奇的 to know /what our listeners’ expenses are. +

[.my2]
我很好奇咱们听众的开销都是什么样的。

M: Yes, we definitely want to know what crazy 离谱的 expenses you have, for example… +
E: Well, let’s see, my spending on _coke zero_ 零度可乐 *has gone through the roof* since we started this podcast. +
M: Hehe. Yes, you spend a lot of money on _coke zeros_ every week, right? +
E: Uh, yeah, I probably have, uh… I don’t know, ten a week. 一周可能要喝十瓶  +
M: Well, for examples, I *spend*, uh, a lot *on* DVDs 数字激光视盘 each week. I usually buy two or three movies. +
E: That is _off the charts_. +
M: Hehe. That is _off the charts_ for DVD spending. +
E: Okay. +
M: So, we want to know what you spend your money on, *be sure* to l… go into 访问 our community website  /and tell us what you spend money on. +
E: That’s right, you can find us at englishpod.com /and Marco and I are always there to respond  (v.) your questions  and comments. +
M: Great, so, we’ll see you there /and until then it’s… +
E: Good bye! +
M: Bye!

What’s going on here! +

tertainment and travel are out of control. Look at
these bills for example. Just this month we’ve paid
over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges! +
A: OK, thank you. I’ll look into it. +
