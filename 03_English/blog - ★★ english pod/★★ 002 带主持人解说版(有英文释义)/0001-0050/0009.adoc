M: Hello English learners! And welcome to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. +
E: And I’m Erica. +
M: Erica, today we are really excited, right? +
E: Yeah. We’ve got a great lesson today all about real English. +
M: Exactly, English that you hear in movies and TV shows. +
E: Yeah, speaking of movies, today’s podcast 播客 takes place 发生在某地 at the movies. +
M: Exactly. And that’s why _it’s so fun_ today. +
E: Aha. +
M: Okay, great. So, before we listen to our dialogue /let’s take a look at our “vocabulary preview”. +

Voice: Vocabulary preview. +
E: In today’s vocabulary preview /we have two words. And the first word is _inconsiderate_ 轻率的；不顾及他人感受的；不体贴的. +
M: Inconsiderate. +
E: Inconsiderate. +
M: So, Erica, what is it /when someone is inconsiderate? +
E: If someone’s inconsiderate, they’re not thinking about the feelings of other people. +
M: Right. So, for example, yesterday I was on the subway 地铁 /and it was full. +
E: Right. +
M: And an old lady was standing there /and no one *got up* 起身 to give her their seat. +
E: That was pretty inconsiderate. +

M: Yeah, great. So, now let’s take a look at our second word. And it’s _keep it down_ 小声点；别吵. +
E: Keep it down. +
M: Keep it down. +
E: Keep it down. +
M: So, why don’t we listen to some examples /on how we use _keep it down_, so we can understand? +

Voice: Example one. +
A: Excuse me, do you mind keeping it down? It’s after midnight 午夜；子夜. +
B: Okay, I’m sorry. +

Voice: Example two. +
C: I’m trying 努力 study 我正在努力学习呢! Do you mind keeping it down? +

Voice: Example three. +
D: Do you mind keeping it down? I’m trying to watch the game.  我想看比赛 +

E: So, that means (v.) be quiet. +
M: Yes, don’t make so much noise 噪音；声响. +
E: I used to hear this one _all the time_ from my mother. +
M: Hehe. I think we all did /when we were children.  我觉得我们小时候都听过吧。 +
E: Yeah. +
M: Okay. So, now let’s listen to the dialogue /for a first time. It’s gonna be kind of fast. +
E: But don’t worry about it /if you can’t understand everything. By the end of today’s lesson /you will understand this dialogue. +

|Header 1

|A: Those people in front of us `谓` are making so much noise. It’s so inconsiderate! +
B: Don’t worry about it; it’s not such a big deal. +
A: Oh... I can’t hear a thing! Excuse me, can you keep it down? +
C: Sure, sorry ’bout that! +
A: Someone’s phone is ringing! +
B: Honey, I think it’s your phone. Did you forget to switch it off? +
A: Oh, no! You’re right. That’s so embarrassing 令人尴尬的；使人难堪的！+
C: Do you mind keeping it down 保持安静? I’m trying to watch a movie here! +
|===


E: Well, I hate it /when people’s phones ring /when I’m watching a movie. +
M: Hehe. I think everyone… gets kind of, uh, angry, but we’re gonna talk about this _a little bit later_. Why don’t we take a look now at our “language takeaway”? +

Voice: Language takeaway. +
E: So, the language takeaway is our most important words for today’s lesson. And our first word today is _not such a big deal_ 没什么大不了的；不是什么大事. +
M: Not such a big deal. +
E: Not such a big deal. +
M: So, when something is not a big deal /it’s… +
E: Not a big problem. +
M: It’s not important, right? +
E: Exactly. +
M: Okay, let’s listen to some examples. +

Voice: Example one. +
A: I can’t get these files 文件；档案 后定说明 _due (a.)到期的 by tomorrow_ 明天截止. +

[.my2]
明天要交的这些文件, 我还没弄好。

B: It’s Okay. It’s not such a big deal. +

Voice: Example two. +
C: Uh, I’m really sorry, I’m gonna be _ten minutes late_ for the meeting. +
D: It’s not such a big deal; Peter and ??? are late too. +

M: Now let’s look at our second word. And it’s _switch it off_ 关掉；关闭（电器等）. +
E: Switch it off. +
M: Switch it off. +
E: Switch it off. +
M: So, this word means _to turn it off_. +
E: To turn something off. +
M: Now, we can use it /in three different ways. +
E: Yeah, this one… it’s a little bit complicated 复杂的；难懂的，because it changes a little bit /depending on how you use it. So, Marco, I think you’ve got some examples for us. +

[.my2]
这个短语有点复杂，因为用法不同，表达形式会稍微有变化。

M: Right, so, for example, I can say “did you *switch off* your phone?” +
E: Or you could say “did you switch your phone off?” +
M: Right, or simply you can ask “did you switch it off?” +
E: I think this one is a little bit hard; let’s look at a couple more examples. +

M: Okay, so, I can say, for example, “Switch off the TV”. +
E: Switch the TV off. +
M: Or switch it off. +
E: Yeah, I think that’s a little bit more clear. +
M: Yeah. +

E: But, you know what? We even 平等的，公平的 had trouble 遇到麻烦 with  that one, didn’t we? +

M: Hehe. Yeah, we had to do it /a couple of times. Okay, now let’s look at our last word and it’s _can’t hear a thing_ 什么都听不见；完全听不见. +
E: Can’t hear a thing. +
M: I can’t hear a thing. +
E: Can’t hear a thing. +
M: Okay, we have some examples for this phrase, so let’s listen. +

Voice: Example one. +
A: What’s going on in there? 里面发生什么事了？ +
B: I don’t know; I can’t hear a thing. +

Voice: Example two. +
C: What? I’m sorry, this music is too loud; I can’t hear a thing. +


E: So, that’s like saying “I can’t hear”. +
M: Exactly. I can’t hear anything. +
E: It’s too loud. +
M: Right, so now we are ready to listen to our dialogue a second time. It’s gonna be slower. +
E: This time listen for some of _the key 关键的；核心的 words_ we were explaining. +

[.my2]
这次注意听我们刚才讲解过的重点词汇。

... +
... +
... +

M: Okay, great, now with the dialogue slower /it’s really understandable 可理解的；能明白的. +
E: Yeah, I think you could catch 捕捉到；听出 those key words a lot better. +
M: Perfect, so now we are ready to look at “putting it together”. +

Voice: Putting it together. +
E: So, in putting it together /we help you use a great phrase in different ways. And today’s phrase is _do you mind_ 你介意吗（用于礼貌请求）. +
M: Do you mind. +
E: Do you mind. +
M: Okay, so, let’s listen to some examples /on how you can use this phrase in different situations 情况；场景. +

Voice: Example one. +
A: Do you mind *holding my coat* 拿着我的外套 for me? +

[.my2]
你介意帮我拿一下外套吗？

Voice: Example two. +
B: Oh, I forgot my wallet 钱包. Do you mind paying for dinner? +

Voice: Example three. +
C: Do you mind turning off your phone? +

E: So, this phrase is usually pretty polite 有礼貌的；客气的. I could say to you, Marco, “do you mind holding my coat for me?” +
M: And that’s really polite. +
E: Yeah, so, would you mind, _do you mind_ are very polite phrases. +

M: But depending on your voice /and how you use your tone 语气；语调，it could be a little bit sarcastic 讽刺的；挖苦的，right? +
E: Yeah, it could be a little bit rude 粗鲁的；无礼的，if you say “would you mind keeping it down?” 你介意小点声吗 +
M: Exactly, like we heard in our dialogue. +
E: Yeah, so, that’s not so polite. +
M: Yeah, exactly, I mean in English /you have to be careful, because your tone of voice tells the other person /how you’re feeling; if you’re angry, sad or… *just like* in any other language. 这和其他语言是一样的。 +
E: Yeah, that’s true. So, I mean, uh, using a phrase like _do you mind_ is a great phrase, but make sure you *keep up* 坚持，维持 positive 积极的；正面的 tone in your voice. +
M: Hehe. Exactly. So *now that* 既然，由于 we’ve talked about all these great things /`主` we `谓` can listen to the dialogue _a third time_, but it’ll be at its normal 正常的；平常的 speed. +

[.my2]
那既然我们把所有重点都讲完了，再来第三遍听对话吧

... +
... +
... +

E: So, I know that /in different countries /there’re different habits 习惯；习俗 about watching movies. +
M: Yeah, that’s definitely 肯定地；毫无疑问地 true. Erica, *what’s it like* in Canada? +
E: Well, in Canada /it’s really common 常见的；普遍的 to eat popcorn 爆米花 and candy 糖果 and, uh, maybe chips 薯片 /while you’re watching a movie, but if your phone rings in the movie theater 电影院 /this is a big problem. +
M: Hehe. I imagine 想象；设想 it is. I mean /I would be upset 沮丧的；生气的 also. +

E: What about in Ecuador 厄瓜多尔（南美洲国家，专有名词）? +
M: Well, in Ecuador and in South America 南美洲（专有名词）/usually people can *bring in* food from the outside. +
E: Really? +
M: Yeah, so, it’s not really uncommon 不常见的；罕见的 *depending on* the city, um, to find people *bringing in* chicken 鸡肉 or some sort of like really smelly 有臭味的；难闻的 food. +

[.my2]
所以，​​根据城市（的不同）​​，发现有人带鸡肉或某种气味很重的食物（进去）并不是什么稀奇事。


E: No way 不会吧. +
M: Hehe. So, you get *either* really hungry 饥饿的 *or* really upset 使心烦意乱，使生气, but that’s what happens. +

E: You know, I used to live in Switzerland 瑞士（欧洲国家，专有名词） /and in Switzerland you would have to eat /before you watch the movie. There was no popcorn 爆米花，爆玉米花, no soda 苏打水；汽水，no candy 糖果，巧克力 inside the movie theater. Can you imagine that? +
M: I could not live with 无法忍受 that, because `主` the whole purpose 目的；意图 of going to the movies `系` is to have some popcorn and relax 放松；休息 and have a good time. +

[.my2]
我可受不了那样，因为去电影院的意义不就是吃点爆米花、放松一下，好好享受嘛。

E: You can’t have a movie without popcorn. +
M: Exactly. +

E: Okay, so, we’ve talked a lot about _how to ask someone to be quiet_ today. And I hope that you’ll go out /and try a few of these phrases in your daily 日常的；每日的 life. +
M: Yes, and I hope also that /you visit our website 网站 at englishpod.com /and leave all your questions and comments 评论；意见. +
E: Marco and I are there everyday, so, we’ll be happy to answer your questions, but until next time… +
M: Bye! +
E: Good bye!
