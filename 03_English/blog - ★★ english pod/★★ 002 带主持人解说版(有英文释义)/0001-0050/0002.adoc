M: Hello English learners! Welcome to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. +
E: And I’m Erica. +
M: And today we’re gonna be bringing you a very useful lesson about being sick 生病. +
E: Yeah, um, we’re going to learn, um, how to tell your boss that you can’t go to work, 
because you’re sick. +
M: Exactly! This is really important, because we all get sick /and sometimes you just can’t go
to work. +
E: Yes! Or maybe sometimes you just don’t want to go to work. +
M: You just… exactly, maybe you’re lying. +
E: Yeah. +
M: But we’re gonna be teaching you _how to do it_ anyway 但无论如何我们都会教你怎么做, so, before we start with our
dialogue, let’s *take a look at* “vocabulary preview”. +


[.my1]
.案例
====
.But we’*re gonna be teaching* you how to do it anyway.
这是 ​​将来进行时 (Future Progressive/Future Continuous Tense)​​ 的一种非正式口语表达。

#将来进行时# (will be doing 或 be going to be doing) 并不只是简单地表示将来会发生的事。它在这里传递了以下几种细微的含义： +

- 强调动作的持续性和过程性​​：**#它强调“教学”这个动作不是瞬间完成的，而是在未来的一段时间内会持续进行。暗示这是一个过程，#**你会在这个过程中学到东西。 +
•对比: We will teach you... (单纯陈述将来会发生的事) +
•对比: We are going to teach you... (陈述将来的计划或意图) +
•本句: We are going to be teaching you... (强调在整个课程/节目期间，*#我们“将会一直在教你”#*) +

- 一种礼貌和温和的表达​​：听起来比直接说 “We will teach you” 或 “We are going to teach you” 更柔和、更不那么强硬。它暗示这是一种自然的、已安排好的进程，而不是一个突兀的命令。

- **表示既定的安排或计划​​：通常用于描述已经决定或计划好的未来事件，尤其是在不久的将来。**在这里，它暗示“教你”是这个节目或课程计划好的一部分内容。


gonna 是 going to 在​​非正式口语​​中的极度常见的缩略形式。它在这个句子中取代了更正式的 will，来表达将来的概念。

所以，​​"We're gonna be teaching you..."​​ 最地道的理解是： +
​​“我们（在接下来的课程中）会教你……”​​ 或 ​​“我们将会一直在教你……”​

Voice: Vocabulary preview. +
E: In this vocabulary preview /we have two words for you. Uh, the first one is _quite ill_. +
M: Quite ill. (指某人生病的程度比较严重，需要得到医疗治疗) +
E: Quite ill. +
M: So, quite ill… +
E: Very sick. +
M: Very sick. +
E: Uhu. +
M: Quite is a synonym 同义词 of very. (Quite是very的同义词) +
E: Exactly! +
M: Okay. +
E: Yeah. +
M: And ill… +
E: Sick. +
M: Sick. +
E: Yeah. +
M: So, they both mean (v.) the same thing, no difference. +
E: No difference at all. I just think, uh, ill is more common in British English. +

M: Uh, exactly. Alright, let’s take a look at our second word – flu. +
E: The flu. +
M: The flu. +
E: The flu. +
M: So, the flu is a virus. +
E: Yeah, it’s a sickness 疾病；呕吐；弊病. +
M: Okay, and, uh… +
E: Uhu. +
M: It’s very similar to a cold 感冒，伤风. +
E: Yes, but just a lot worse. +
M: A lot worse, so, it’s stronger. +
E: Yeah, yeah. Um, it’s also called influenza 流行性感冒. +
M: Influenza. +
E: Aha. +
M: Exactly. So, the flu. +
E: Uhu. +

M: Okay, so, let’s listen to our dialogue. What’s gonna happen here today? +
E: Well, we’re going to listen /as Julie calls her boss to tell him she’s sick. +
M: Alright, but is she really sick? +
E: I don’t know. Let’s find out. +

|A: Hello, Daniel speaking, how may I help you? +
B: Hi, Daniel, Julie here. +
A: Hi, Julie, how are you? +
B: Actually, I’m feeling _quite ill_ today. +
A: I’m sorry to hear that. What’s wrong? +
B: I think I’m *coming down with* 染上（疾病） the flu. I have a
headache, a sore throat /a runny nose /and I’m
feeling slightly feverish (a.)发烧的，发热的. +
A: I see... so you’re calling in sick? 你打电话请病假 +
B: Yes, I was hoping *to take the day off* 请假一天 to recover. +
A: OK, then. Try and get some rest. 
|===


M: Alright, so, Julie didn’t really seem to be sick, ha? +
E: Yeah, I… I don’t know /th… that cough was just a little too much 咳得太厉害了. +
M: It seemed like /she was acting. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Alright, so, let’s take a look at some of this vocabulary in “language takeaway 外卖食品”. +
Voice: Language takeaway. +
E: We have five words for you here /and these are all great words to describe a sickness,
right? +
M: Uhu. +
E: Alright, the first one – headache. +
M: Headache. +
E: Headache. +
M: Headache. +
E: So, when you have a headache, you have a sore （发炎）疼痛的，酸痛的 head, right? +
M: Right, your head hurts 指（身体部位）感到疼痛、（某一动作）引起疼痛. +
E: Uhu. +
M: So, it’s pretty simple. +
E: Yep. +
M: You have a headache. +
E: It’s the way /you feel _after, um, being at a bar too late_. 就是你在酒吧待得太晚后的感觉。 +
M: Yeah… +
E: Yeah. +
M: When you drink too much… +
E: Yeah. +
M: You get a headache. +
E: Yeah. +

M: Alright, let’s take a look at our next word – sore throat 喉咙痛. +
E: Sore throat. +
M: Sore throat. +
E: Sore throat. +
M: So, basically, we have two words here, let’s look at the first one – sore. +
E: Hurting. +
M: It hurts 使疼痛, right? +
E: Yeah. +
M: And your throat is… +
E: Well, it… you know /it’s the part _right here_, at the back… oh, you can’t see me. +
[Comment: Erica *points at* her throat, but realizes _right away_ 立刻,马上 that /we can’t see her 马上意识到我们看不到她的动作,
because it’s a podcast, not a videocast.] +
M: Hehe. +
E: Well, it’s the part, um, at the back of your mouth /that goes down to your stomach 胃；腹部. +
M: Alright, that’s your throat. +
E: Yeah. +
M: So, you use (v.) your throat to swallow 你用喉咙吞咽. +
E: Uhu. +
M: Okay. Now, we can use the word sore /with different body parts 我们可以在身体的不同部位,使用酸痛这个词, right? +
E: Yeah, like, um, a sore back 背部疼痛. +
M: A sore back, right? Or maybe you were playing tennis all weekend, so you have a sore arm 酸痛的胳膊. +
E: Aha, or even a sore neck 颈部疼痛. +
M: Right. +
E: Uhu. +

M: So, the word sore. Let’s take a look at our third word – running (a.) nose 流鼻涕. +
E: Running nose. +
M: Running nose. +
E: Running nose. +
M: This is a very strange word. +
E: I know. +
M: But it doesn’t mean that /your nose is running, right? +
E: No, but… okay, um, it… no, but when you have a running nose, um, there’s lots of water 
coming out of your nose, right? +
M: Right. +
E: So, it’s interesting though, because when you run, you go fast, right?

[.my2]
当你跑步时，你移动得很快. (这里其实是在玩一个​​文字游戏​​，用来解释为什么“流鼻涕”会被称为 ​​“running nose”​​。) +

M: Hehe. So, a lot of water is… +
E: Coming fast out of your nose. +
M: Out of your nose. Running nose. +
E: Yeah. +

M: Okay, our forth word today – slightly feverish (发烧的，发热的) 低烧. +
E: Slightly feverish. +
M: Slightly feverish. +
E: Slightly feverish. +
M: So, again, slightly is… +
E: A little bit. +
M: A little bit… +
E: Uhu. +
M: Right? A little bit. And feverish? +
E: Well, let’s break this word down 让我们分解一下这个单词. Um, we know fever, right? +
M: Uhu. +
E: Um, so, when you’re… when your body is very, very hot… +
M: Right. +
E: Because you’re sick. So, feverish is the feeling or your body being very, very hot. +
M: Uhu. Okay, so, you have a high temperature. +
E: It’s not that you have a high temperature, but you feel like you have a high temperature. +
M: Okay, so, slightly feverish. +
E: Uhu. +

M: And our last word – to recover. +
E: Recover. +
M: Recover. +
E: Recover. +
M: So, this means to get better, right? +
E: Exactly. +
M: Can you only use it /when you’re sick? 你只能在生病的时候用吗？ +
E: So, when you recover, you get better and you rest (v.)休息，歇息, so, maybe you can say, um, “I was
so busy this week, I need to recover at this weekend”. +
M: Okay, so, yeah, if you feel tired… +
E: Yeah. +
M: Or you feel sick, you can recover. +
E: Uhu. +

M: Okay, let’s listen to our dialogue again /and we can listen to these words that we’ve just
talked about. +

|A: Hello, Daniel speaking, how may I help you? +
B: Hi, Daniel, Julie here. +
A: Hi, Julie, how are you? +
B: Actually, I’m feeling quite ill today. +
A: I’m sorry to hear that. What’s wrong? +
B: I think I’m coming down with the flu. I have a
headache, a sore throat a runny nose and I’m

M: In this dialogue /we listened to some really interesting phrases /of how you can tell your
boss that _you’re feeling sick_, right? +
E: Yeah, some great phrases, so, let’s look at these /in “fluency （说话）流利 builder 流利的建设者”. +
Voice: Fluency builder. +
M: Okay, let’s take a look at our first phrase /on fluency builder – I’m *coming down with* 染上（疾病）. +
E: I’m coming down with. +
M: I’m coming down with. +
E: I’m coming down with. +
M: Alright, so, let’s listen to some examples /and then we’ll come back and explain this
interesting phrase. +


Voice: Example one. +
A: My throat really hurts. I think *I’m coming down with* a cold. +

Voice: Example two. +
B: You have a running nose. *Are you coming down with* the flu? +

Voice: Example three. +
C: I don’t feel well. I think *I’m coming down with* something. +

M: Okay, so, basically, coming down with means… +
E: Starting to get sick. +
M: Uh… um, beginning to feel sick. +
E: Yes. +
M: Okay, so, you can use it /with “I’m coming down with the flu”. +
E: Aha, I’m coming down with a cold. +
M: Uhu. Or I’m coming down with a cough. +
E: Yeah, or I’m coming down with something. +
M: With something, you don’t know what it is. +
E: Exactly. +


M: Okay, let’s take a look at our second phrase – calling in sick 打电话请病假. +
E: Calling in sick. +
M: Okay, calling in sick. +
E: So, this phrase is great! You know, when you say “I’m calling in sick”… +
M: Uhu. +
E: You’re saying “hey I’m not going to come to work today, because I’m sick”. +
M: Okay, so, literally, it means that you call your office… +
E: Yeah. +
M: And you say /you’re not going to work. +
E: Yes, um, but it’s great, cause it’s three words /that show such a long idea. +
M: Right, because otherwise /you would have to say “I’m calling, because I don’t feel well,
so, I’m not gonna go to work”. +
E: Yes! +
M: But if you say “I’m calling in sick”, everyone knows… +
E: Everyone understands. +
M: That you’re not gonna go to work. +
E: Yep. +

M: Okay, now, let’s take a look at our last phrase – take the day off 请假一天. +
E: Take the day off. +
M: Take the day off. +
E: Take the day off. +
M: Now, this is a great phrase! _To take the day off_ is to… +
E: Not go to work. +
M: On that day. +
E: Yes! +
M: Now, you can say “take the… week off”. +
E: Uhu, take the month off 休一个月假. +
M: Take the month off or… +
E: Yeah. +
M: Take the year off. +
E: Yeah, if you’re so lucky. +
M: Hehe. Alright, so, _take the day off_ means to not go to work on that day. +
E: Uhu. +
M: Alright, let’s listen to our dialogue again now /and then we’ll come back and talk a little
bit more. +

E: Well, Marco, um, have you ever done _what Julie did_? Did you ever call your boss /to say
you’re sick to… when you’re not really? +
M: Yeah, of course! I mean, sometimes /you just don’t feel very well, but you’re not really
sick 你并不是真的病了, you just don’t *feel like* going to work 你只是不想去上班. +
E: Yes. +
M: Or sometimes you have something to do. +

M: Hehe. We used to do 过去常常做某事 that a lot 我们以前经常这么做, because, for example, soccer games are such a big deal. +
E: Oh, yeah! +
M: And, you know, sometimes you would have, ah, a soccer match between, I don’t know, 
Brazil… and it would be maybe at 10 a.m. 午前；早上 or 11 a.m., so, everyone would *call in sick* on that
day. +
E: Yeah, so, the boss at least could plan that /he would have an empty office. +
M: Yeah, or sometimes you would take half the day off. +
E: Uh. +
M: So, you would just go… you say “well, I’m not gonna make it /in the morning, but I’ll
come /in the afternoon”. +
E: So, you would recover… +
M: A l… +
E: Very quickly. +
M: Yeah, I’m feeling a little bit sick, but I’m going to be better in the afternoon. +
E: Yeah. +
