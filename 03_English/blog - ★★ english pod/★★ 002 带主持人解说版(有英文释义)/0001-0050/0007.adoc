M: Hello English learners and welcome to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. +
E: And I’m Erica. +
M: Hey Erica, how are you today? +
E: Marco, I’m doing really well /and I’m really looking forward to today’s lesson. +
M: Well, so am I, because here at EnglishPod /we’re giving you real English. +
E: Everyday English. +
M: Exactly, English that you hear in movies or in TV-shows 电视节目. +
E: This is English /people actually use. +
M: So, Erica, what is our topic for today? +
E: Well, today we’re talking about computer viruses 电脑病毒. +
M: Perfect! So, I think it’s time for us to take a look at our preview 预习内容. +

Voice: Vocabulary preview. +
E: Okay, today we’ve got two words to preview. The first word is virus. +
M: Virus. +
E: Virus. +
M: Virus. +
E: So, if your computer has a computer virus, it means your computer is sick, right? +
M: Actually, a computer virus is a program that is designed to harm or to damage your 
computer. +
E: Oh, I see, okay… +
M: And… +
E: Well, thank you for being so technical 技术的；专业的. 谢谢你给出这么专业的解释 +

M: Hehe. That’s the technical explanation. Okay, let’s take a look at our second word for our
preview today /and that would be _froze_ 卡住、死机. +
E: Froze. +
M: Froze. +
E: Froze. +
M: So, if your computer froze, it means that… +
E: Your computer stopped working. +
M: Your applications or your programs stop working /and you just can’t do anything. +
E: Your computer’s broken  损坏的. +
M: Okay, great, so, let’s listen to our dialogue. It’s gonna be a little bit fast, but… +
E: Don’t worry if you don’t understand everything. At the end of this podcast /you’ll
understand everything. +
M: Perfect! Let’s listen. +

|A: Oh great! This stupid computer froze (v.) again!
That’s the third time today! Hey Samuel, can
you come take a look at my PC? It’s acting up 功能失常，出毛病
again. It must have a virus or something. +
B: Just give me a second; I’ll be right up 我马上就上去,立刻就到. +
B: I ran a virus scan on your computer, and it turns
out that /you have a lot of infected files! +
A: But I’m quite careful /when I’m browsing the
internet, I have no idea how I could have picked
up （偶然）得到，听到，学会;得；感染 a virus. +
B: Well, you have to make sure /that your anti-virus
software is updated regularly; yours wasn’t up to
date, that’s probably what was causing your prob-
lems. +
A: Ok. Anything else? +
B: Yeah, try not to kick or hit the computer! +
A: Um yeah… Sorry about that.

M: Well, I completely understand this guy. When my computer freezes /I kick it and punch it
and do everything to it. +
E: Well, I hope you don’t punch it too hard, Marco. +
M: Well, it’s still working, so it’s alright. +
E: Okay. +
M: Alright, let’s take look at our “language takeaway”. +
Voice: Language takeaway. +
E: In today’s language takeaway /we have two words. The first word for today is infected
file. +
M: Infected file. +
E: Infected file. +
M: Infected file. And what is an infected file? +
E: An infected file is a file in your computer /that has a virus in it. +

M: Uh, perfect, that’s really clear! What is our second word for the language takeaway
today? +
E: Our second word is _not **up to date**_ (最新的) 未更新到最新版本、过时的. +
M: Not *up to date*. +
E: Note up to date. +
M: And what is it /when something is _not up to date_? +
E: It means it doesn’t have all the most recent information. +
M: Okay, perfect! Now, let’s listen to some examples. +

Voice: Example one. +
A: I need to buy a new computer, because mine isn’t _up to date_. +

Voice: Example two. +
B: I can’t find this street. Are you sure this map is up to date? +

Voice: Example three. +
C: Sarah has just finished the report /and all the information is up to date. +

E: Okay, that was pretty clear. You know, you can also use this phrase positively. You can 
say up to date. +
M: Okay, for example, we can say “this is a new map, this the most _up to date_ map”. +
E: Exactly, or if I bought a new computer, I could say “I just got a new computer, all my 
software is up to date”. +

M: Okay, great! So, now let’s take a look at some phrases. +
E: And it’s time for “*putting it all together*”. (将所有东西放在一起; 理解，掌握) 接下来到 “学以致用” 环节啦。 +
Voice: Putting it together. +
E: Okay, so, Samuel said a really great phrase. He said _I’ll be right up_. +

[.my2]
塞缪尔（Samuel）说了一个特别好的短语。他说 “I’ll be right up”（我马上就上来）。

M: I’ll be right up. +
E: I’ll be right up. +
M: I’ll be right up. Now, we can use this phrase in a lot of different situations, so, let’s listen 
to some examples. +

Voice: Example one. +
A: Can you help me with my computer? +

B: #I’ll be right there.# 我马上就到 +

Voice: Example two. +
C: Come downstairs. Dinner is ready. +
D: #I’ll be right down#! 我马上就下来 +

Voice: Example three. +
E: Hurry up! I need to use the bathroom! 我要上厕所 +
F: #I’ll be right out!# 我马上就出来 +

M: Okay, really great and clear examples, right? +
E: Yeah, you know that phrase “I’ll be right out”? I used to hear this all the time /when I was
young. +
M: Really? _How come_? 怎么回事,为什么呀? +
E: Well, I have two sisters /and we were always fighting for the bathroom, so, someone was
always saying “Just a minute! I’ll be right out!” 等一下！我马上就出来 +

M: Uh, yes, that’s common 确实很常见. I had that too /when I was young. Okay, now our second phrase
is _it turns out that_. +
E: It turns out that. +
M: It turns out that. +
E: It turns out that. This is a great phrase, you can use it in many different satiations. 
Marco, can you give us an example? +
M: Sure! For example, I can say “Frank didn’t come to work today /and it turns out that he
was sick”. +
E: Yep! Or I could say “Oh, I’ve been feeling really sick recently /and it…” +
M: Why? +
E: “It turns out that /I’m pregnant”. +
M: Oh, my God! Are you really pregnant? +
E: No, I’m not, Marco, I’m just kidding. +
M: Alright, because… Okay, so, it’s time for us to listen to our dialogue again, but this time 
it’ll be… +
E: A little bit slower. +
M: Alright. +

E: Okay, that was a lot more clear this time. +
M: Definitely, yeah, I understood a lot more. Okay, so, now it’s time to look at “fluency 
builder”. Erica, why don’t you explain what fluency builder is? +
E: In fluency builder /we give you some great useful phrases /to help you express your ideas
clearly. +
M: Okay, great, so, let’s look at fluency builder. +
Voice: Fluency builder. +
E: Okay, so, in this dialogue /we know his computer wasn’t working. +
M: Right, so, many students would probably say “His computer was acting strangely”. +
E: “His computer isn’t working properly”. +
M: Exactly, and that’s perfect /and that’s fine. +
E: Yeah, but there’s a really great way to say it /that we heard in the dialogue.

Phrase 1: #It’s *acting up* 功能失常，出毛病;恶化，加重  again#. It’s acting up again. +

M: It sounds really natural. Okay, we’re ready to listen to our dialogue a third time, but this 
time… +
E: It’ll be at the normal speed. Try and see if you can hear these keywords. +

E: So, Marco, I really think that /my computer actually has a virus now. +
M: Really? How come 怎么回事? +
E: Because I have been turning on my computer /and then suddenly it *turns off* 关闭 by itself. +

[.my2]
因为我一打开电脑，它就会突然自己关机

M: Uhu. +
E: It shuts down by itself. +
M: Yeah, that sounds like a virus. +
E: But I ran a virus scan /and there was no problem. +
M: Hm, well, maybe your antivirus software isn’t up to date. +
E: Yeah, I guess /I’d better call Samuel. +
M: Yeah! Yeah, you can call Samuel to fix it. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Alright, folks, we’re out of time now, but be sure to go to our website at
