M: Great, so, why don't we take a look at our “vocabulary preview” for today? +

Voice: Vocabulary preview. +
E: So, our 'vocabulary preview' is a part of our lesson /when we teach you some really important words /that will help you to understand the dialogue better. +
M: Okay, great, so, that is _what vocabulary preview is_ 什么是词汇预习. We have two words for you today /and we can *start off* 以…开始 by looking at the first one. +

E: Our first word today is _drive (v.) sales_ 推动销售；提高销量. +
M: Drive (v.) sales. +
E: Drive sales. +
M: To drive sales, and that means… +
E: To increase sales. +
M: Right, to sell more. +
E: Exactly, so, to drive sales. +

M: Okay, so, now let's look at our second word /and it's an interesting one, it's promotion 促销活动；推广（此处指商业促销，非职位晋升）. +
E: Promotion. +
M: Promotion. +
E: Promotion. +
M: So, Erica, what is a promotion exactly? +
E: Okay, so here, we're not really talking about getting a better job, right? +
M: Okay, uh, not like a job promotion. +
E: No, we're talking about a marketing strategy. +
M: Okay, so, I can give you an example. *Suppose that* 假设，假定 I wanna buy shampoo 洗发剂；香波. +
E: Aha. +
M: And, if I go to the supermarket 超级市场；超市 and I see “Buy one and get one free”… +
E: So, that's a two-for-one 买一送一的；两件只算一件价格的. +
M: That's a two-for-one promotion, yeah? +
E: Yeah, okay. +
M: That's a sales promotion. Or… +
E: Perhaps the shampoo in the supermarket is less expensive 便宜一点 than usual. +
M: Okay, so… +
E: Maybe… yeah, usually, maybe it costs (v.) five dollars, but today it costs four dollars, that's a sales promotion. +
M: Great, so, that's a really good marketing strategy. +
E: Exactly, and we'll hear this word in our dialogue today. +

M: Great, so, we are ready to listen to our dialogue. It's gonna be pretty fast, so it might be a little bit difficult to understand. +
E: But don't worry if you don't understand everything, because later in this lesson /we're gonna explain all the important words and phrases. +

|Header 1

|A: All right, people. We’re holding this meeting today /because we’ve got to do something about our sales, and we need to do it NOW! I want concrete 具体的；切实的 solutions. How do you intend to drive (v.) sales... Roger? +
B: Well, in fact, we’re the most expensive in the market, so maybe we need to lower (v.) our prices /to match the competitors 与竞争对手持平（价格、水平等）；对标竞争对手? +
A: Lower (v.) our prices? Not very creative 有创造力的；创新性的. It’ll never fly (被认可，被接受)行不通；不会被接受；不可能成功 with Swan. What kind of thinking is that 这是什么想法啊? Geez 天啊. Anybody else have a better plan? Natalie? +

C: Um, perhaps, um, a sales promotion. Maybe a two-for-one offer (特价；优惠（商品或服务）)买一送一优惠, or something like that! +
A: What? That’s the same thing. Bad idea. Really bad idea. Dammit people come on! Think! The CEO 首席执行官（全写为 Chief Executive Officer） will be here any minute. +

D: Do we have any ideas yet? +
C: Yes Mr. Swan, we were kind of considering 考虑；斟酌 a two-for-one offer 买一送一优惠 to get more competitive 有竞争力的；竞争能力强的. +
D: A two-for-one promotion? Hmm. I kind of 有点儿,有几分 like the sound 声音，声响 of that. It *sounds like* something we should consider. +
A: Yeah, exactly. Just what I was thinking! In fact, that’s a brilliant 极好的；绝妙的；才华横溢的 idea! I’m glad we *thought of* that 真高兴我们能想到这个办法. Very creative.

M: Okay, so, an interesting manager, right? +
E: I don't know about interesting, maybe I would think bad manager. +

[.my2]
我不知道他是否有趣，或许我会认为他是一个糟糕的经理。

M: Hehe. We're gonna talk about him _later on_ 稍后 in the show, but now let's take a look at our “language takeaway”. +

Voice: Language takeaway. +
E: Okay, so, 'language takeaway' is the part of our lesson /where we teach you the most important words from the dialogue. All these words that we are going to focus on /can be found in today's dialogue. +
M: Exactly, so, we have three words for you today, let's look at the first one -– match (v.) the competitors 匹配竞争对手. +
E: Match the competitors. 与竞争对手持平（价格、水平等）；对标竞争对手 +
M: Match the competitors. +
E: Match the competitors. +
M: Great, so, we have some examples for you, so you can listen /and try and see if you can figure out 弄明白；搞清楚 what _match the competitors_ really means. +

Voice: Example one. +
A: We guarantee 保证；担保 that /we can match the competitors’ lowest price. +

[.my2]
我们 “guarantee”（保证；担保）能做到与竞争对手的最低价格持平。

Voice: Example two. +
B: It’s impossible 不可能的；办不到的 for us /to match the competitors. Our costs 成本；费用 are just too high. +

Voice: Example three. +
C: Do you think /we can match our competitors’ prices /and still keep our quality 质量；品质 high? +

E: Uh, okay, so, I see 我明白了 /that _match the competitors_ means (v.) `宾` to be *as good as* or *better than* other companies /in the same industry 行业；产业. +
M: Exactly, match the competitors. +

E: Alright, so, let's *move to* our second word today for language takeaways /and it is _in the market_ 在行业内；在市场上. +
M: In the market. +
E: In the market. +
M: In the market. +
E: We heard this phrase in the dialogue /and it means _in the industry_ 在这个行业里,在行业中. +
M: Exactly, I can say, for example, “EnglishPod is the best language pod 播客（全写为 podcast） in the market”. +
E: So, of all the podcasts 播客（一种音频节目） that teach English EnglishPod is the best. +

[.my2]
在所有教英语的 “podcasts”（播客，一种音频节目）里，EnglishPod 是最好的。

M: Of course. +
E: Yeah. +
M: No doubt about it. 毫无疑问 +
E: I totally agree. +

M: Right, or I can give you another example “iPods are the most popular mp3-players (MP3播放器) in the market”. +
E: So, of all the mp3 players in the world /iPods are the most popular. So, let's move to our final word for today /and it is… +
M: It’ll never fly 行不通；不会被接受；不可能成功. +
E: It'll never fly. +
M: It'll never fly. +
E: It will never fly. +
M: So, this phrase sounds (v.) a little bit strange. +
E: I know, fly? Are we talking about an airplane 飞机 here? What's going on? +
M: Hehe. Exactly, but we're not, so… so, we're gonna give you some examples /and try and guess what _it’ll never fly_ really means. +

Voice: Example one. +
A: This marketing plan will never fly 行不通. It’s just too expensive. +

Voice: Example two. +
B: What? You want to sell (v.) bikinis 比基尼泳装 in Alaska? That’ll never fly. +

Voice: Example three. +
C: Brad told me _his idea for film script_ 电影剧本, but the story will never fly. It’s not interesting enough. +

E: So, it means _it won't work_. +
M: It won't work, it's not a good idea. +
E: They'll never agree. +
M: Exactly. Great, so, now we've seen a lot of useful phrases /and we are ready to listen to our dialogue a second time, but this time /it's gonna be slow. +
E: So, you'll be able to understand a little bit better /and you'll be able to hear the words and phrases /we were just talking about. +

\... +
\... +
\... +
 
M: Okay, great, I hope everyone understands a lot better now. +
E: And I hope everyone could *listen out 留心听,专注地听某个期望的声音 for* some of those key words. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.listen (ˈout) for sth
to be prepared /to hear (v.) a particular sound 留心听（某种声音） +
•Can you *listen out /for* the doorbell? 你能留心听着门铃吗？


====


M: Right, so, now it's time for us to take a look at “fluency builder”. +
Voice: Fluency builder. +
E: So, with 'fluency builder' /we try to help you increase your fluency （语言的）流利度；流畅度. We take a word or phrase that you already know /and show you how to say it *_a little bit more naturally_, _a little bit more_ like* a native English speaker. +
M: Right, and we have three of these words for you today. +
E: Yeah. +

M: Let's start with the first one. Okay, so, often /students will say something like… +
E: “I'll be here soon”. 我很快就到这儿了 +
M: Or… +
E: “I will arrive soon”. 我很快就到了 +
M: Right, and these sentences are correct. +
E: They're totally fine, but I think there's a better way to say this. +
M: Right, and we heard it in the dialogue, so, let's listen to what the person in the dialogue said.

Phrase 1: The CEO *will be here any minute* 随时；马上. The CEO will be here any minute. +
M: Okay, so, #be here any minute#, he'll be here any minute. It just sounds a little bit more natural. +
E: Yeah, I think I use this phrase quite often, he’ll be here any minute. +
M: He'll be here soon. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Great. Okay, so, let's *move on to* our second phrase for fluency builder. +
E: So, this phrase will help you to learn how to say “I'm thinking about something 我正在考虑某件事” *in a better sounding (a.)听起来…的方式,表达方式 way* (用一种听起来更好的表达方式,更自然地表达). +
M: Right, so, you can say something like “We are thinking about a sales strategy”. +
E: Or “That sounds like something we should *think about*”. +

[.my2]
这似乎是个我们应该考虑的事情。

M: Right, and it's perfectly correct. +
E: Yeah, there's no problem with this. +
M: But in the dialogue we heard something a little bit different, so, let's listen to it.

Phrase 2: It sounds like something we should *consider*. It sounds like something we should consider. +
M: So, _consider_ *sounds like* a pretty natural way of saying it, right? +
E: Yeah, and you know what, I think /it sounds (v.) really kind of smart 聪明的，明智的. +
M: Yeah, it sounds (v.) more formal 正式的；礼节性的 even, at times. +

[.my2]
有时候听起来还更 “formal”（正式的；礼节性的）一些。

E: A little more professional 专业的；职业的. +
M: Yeah. +
E: Yeah. +
M: It's a good word. +
E: Yeah. +

M: Okay, brilliant! So, let's move on to our third word. +
E: Marco you already said our third word. +

[.my2]
你刚才已经说出第三个词了哦。

M: Hehe. Oh, yeah, I actually did. _Brilliant_, um, that's a great word right there. +

[.my2]
哦，对，我确实说了。“Brilliant”（极好的；绝妙的），这个词本身就很棒。

E: Yeah. A lot of people might say “That's a great idea!” or “Great!”, but in the dialogue /we heard another way of saying this same idea.

Phrase 3: #That’s a brilliant idea#. That’s a brilliant idea. +
M: Okay, so, this is great, but I would have to say that /it's a little bit more British English. +
E: Yeah, I'd agree with you there, but I also think / `主` it `谓` sort of *gives* (v.) more power *to* _this idea /同位 that it's a good idea_. Brilliant idea! +

[.my2]
但我觉得它还能更强烈地表达 “这是个好主意” 的意思。

M: That _it's a really, really good idea_. +

[.my2]
就是 “这是个非常非常好的主意”。

E: Yeah, yeah. +
M: And I like that word. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Okay, so, we're ready to listen to our dialogue again, a third time, but at its normal speed. +

\... +
\... +
\... +
 
M: Alright, so, `主` listening to this dialogue `谓` makes you think about this boss. I'm pretty sure /everyone has had a manager 经理；管理者 or a… supervisor 主管；督导员 that's similar to this guy. +
E: Yeah, this boss - a clerk 职员；办事员（此处语境中可理解为“职位不高却摆架子的管理者”）. I would have to say /he sounds like a terrible person to work for. +
M: Hehe. Yeah, that's true. If you're a manager, you want to motivate 激励；激发（某人的积极性） your employees 雇员；员工. +
E: I think it's `主` the most important thing 后定说明 a manager does `系` is to encourage (v.)鼓励；激励 his or her employees /and to help support them to grow /and to be better people in the job /and this guy is totally not doing this. +
M: And you can tell, because they are a little bit scared (a.)惊恐的，恐惧的；担心的，焦虑的 of talking /and he *cuts them off* 打断（某人的话） with saying “Oh, it's a bad idea, give me a better idea” and stuff 后定说明 like that 等等类似的东西. +
E: Yeah, I could never work for 为……工作 a guy like this. +
M: Hehe. +

E: You know, my first boss that I had /when I first entered the workforce 劳动力；就业人口（此处指“职场”）, um, I was in a very junior position 初级职位；基层岗位 /and I was working for a large company /and the General Manager 总经理（缩写为 GM） of the company, he was amazing 惊人的，了不起的, he was so encouraging 特别会鼓励人. He knew every single employee's name, first name, and he would, you know, make an effort 努力；尽力 to stop /and say “Hello” /and ask them _how things were going_. 他还会特意停下来跟你打招呼，问你近况怎么样。 And, you know what, this left me with such a good feeling about the company /that I really want *to work hard for* this company /and try my best. And I think that /I've never… met such a great boss as 如同 this guy. 我觉得我再也没遇到过这么好的老板了。 +

M: No, I think that's true. Definitely, if you have a boss that's encouraging and motivating like that, it makes you work (v.) harder /and makes you feel part of a really special team 团队；工作组 /and that's something we can all agree on /and I'm sure `主` all our managers _out there_ 在（某个范围）之外的,广大的,所有的 谓` do the same. Well, you know what, I hope some of our listeners *log on 登录（电脑系统、网站等） to* our website /and maybe they can tell us some experiences 经历；体验 with bad managers or good managers /or if they are managers, how they handle 处理；应对 things. +

[.my2]
是啊，你说得太对了。如果有这样一位会鼓励人、能激发员工积极性的老板，你肯定会更努力工作，也会觉得自己是这个特别棒的 “team”（团队；工作组）的一员 —— 这一点大家肯定都同意，而且我相信所有管理者都会这么做。

[.my1]

M: Welcome back English learners! My name is Marco and I'm joined by… +
E: Erica. +
M: How are you Erica? +
E: I'm doing great, Marco, and you? +
M: Excellent, I'm doing really well and I'm really excited about our lesson for today. +
E: That's right, we've got an intermediate lesson today and we're gonna study some real 
English. +
M: English that you use everyday, right? +
E: That's right, English that native speakers really use. +
M: Exactly, and today as Erica mentioned we have an intermediate lesson and not only is an 
intermediate, but it's a business lesson. +
E: Yeah, so, today we're listening in to a sales meeting and we're going to learn some 
great useful English to talk about sales strategies. So, we're gonna learn English for sales
strategies, for making suggestions and for responding to suggestions. +
M: Great, so, why don't we take a look at our “vocabulary preview” for today? +
Voice: Vocabulary preview. +
E: So, our 'vocabulary preview' is a part of our lesson when we teach you some really 
important words that will help you to understand the dialogue better. +
M: Okay, great, so, that is what vocabulary preview is. We have two words for you today 
and we can start off by looking at the first one. +
E: Our first word today is drive sales. +
M: Drive sales. +
E: Drive sales. +
M: To drive sales, and that means… +
E: To increase sales. +
M: Right, to sell more. +
E: Exactly, so, to drive sales. +
M: Okay, so, now let's look at our second word and it's an interesting one, it's promotion. +
E: Promotion. +
M: Promotion. +
E: Promotion. +
M: So, Erica, what is a promotion exactly? +
E: Okay, so here, we're not really talking about getting a better job, right? +
M: Okay, uh, not like a job promotion. +
E: No, we're talking about a marketing strategy. +
M: Okay, so, I can give you an example. Suppose that I wanna buy shampoo. +
E: Aha. +
M: And, if I go to the supermarket and I see “Buy one and get one free”… +
E: So, that's a two-for-one. +
M: That's a two-for-one promotion, yeah? +
E: Yeah, okay. +
M: That's a sales promotion. Or… +
E: Perhaps the shampoo in the supermarket is less expensive than usual. +
M: Okay, so… +
E: Maybe… yeah, usually, maybe it costs five dollars, but today it costs four dollars, that's a 
sales promotion. +
M: Great, so, that's a really good marketing strategy. +
E: Exactly, and we'll hear this word in our dialogue today. +
M: Great, so, we are ready to listen to tour dialogue. It's gonna be pretty fast, so it might 
be a little bit difficult to understand. +
E: But don't worry if you don't understand everything, because later in this lesson we're 
gonna explain all the important words and phrases. +

A: All right, people. We’re holding this meeting to- 
day because we’ve got to do something about our
sales, and we need to do it NOW! I want concrete
solutions. How do you intend to drive sales...
Roger? +
B: Well, in fact, we’re the most expensive in the mar- 
ket, so maybe we need to lower our prices to
match the competitors? +
A: Lower our prices? Not very creative. It’ll never fly 
with Swan. What kind of thinking is that? Geez.
Anybody else have a better plan? Natalie? +
C: Um, perhaps, um, a sales promotion. Maybe a 
two-for-one offer, or something like that! +
A: What? That’s the same thing. Bad idea. Really 
bad idea. Dammit people come on! Think! The
CEO will be here any minute. +
D: Do we have any ideas yet? +
C: Yes Mr. Swan, we were kind of considering a two- 
for-one offer to get more competitive. +
D: A two-for-one promotion? Hmm. I kind of like the 
sound of that. It sounds like something we should
consider. +
A: Yeah, exactly. Just what I was thinking! In fact, 
that’s a brilliant idea! I’m glad we thought of that.
Very creative.
 
M: Okay, so, an interesting manager, right? +
E: I don't know about interesting, maybe I would think bad manager. +
M: Hehe. We're gonna talk about him later on in the show, but now let's take a look at our 
“language takeaway”. +
Voice: Language takeaway. +
E: Okay, so, 'language takeaway' is the part of our lesson where we tech you the most 
important words from the dialogue. All these words that we are going to focus on can be
found in today's dialogue. +
M: Exactly, so, we have three words for you today, let's look at the first one – match the 
competitors. +
E: Match the competitors. +
M: Match the competitors. +
E: Match the competitors. +
M: Great, so, we have some examples for you, so you can listen and try and see if you can 
figure out what match the competitors really means. +
Voice: Example one. +
A: We guarantee that we can match the competitors’ lowest price. +
Voice: Example two. +
B: It’s impossible for us to match the competitors. Our costs are just too high. +
Voice: Example three. +
C: Do you think we can match our competitors’ prices and still keep our quality high? +
E: Uh, okay, so, I see that match the competitors means to be as good as or better than 
other companies in the same industry. +
M: Exactly, match the competitors. +
E: Alright, so, let's move to our second word today for language takeaways and it is in the 
market. +
M: In the market. +
E: In the market. +
M: In the market. +
E: We heard this phrase in the dialogue and it means in the industry. +
M: Exactly, I can say, for example, “EnglishPod is the best language pod in the market”. +
E: So, of all the podcasts that teach English EnglishPod is the best. +
M: Of course. +
E: Yeah. +
M: No doubt about it. +
E: I totally agree. +
M: Right, or I can give you anther example “iPods are the most popular mp3-players in the 
market”. +
E: So, of all the mp3 players in the world iPods are the most popular. So, let's move to our 
final word for today and it is… +
M: It’ll never fly. +
E: It'll never fly. +
M: It'll never fly. +
E: It will never fly. +
M: So, this phrase sounds a little bit strange. +
E: I know, fly? Are we talking about an airplane here? What's going on? +
M: Hehe. Exactly, but we're not, so… so, we're gonna give you some examples and try and 
guess what it’ll never fly really means. +
Voice: Example one. +
A: This marketing plan will never fly. It’s just too expensive. +
Voice: Example two. +
B: What? You want to sell bikinis in Alaska? That’ll never fly. +
Voice: Example three. +
C: Brad told me his idea for film script, but the story will never fly. It’s not interesting 
enough. +
E: So, it means it won't work. +
M: It won't work, it's not a good idea. +
E: They'll never agree. +
M: Exactly. Great, so, now we've seen a lot of useful phrases and we are ready to listen to 
our dialogue a second tine, but this time it's gonna be slow. +
E: So, you'll be able to understand a little bit better and you'll be able to hear the ph… 
words and phrases we were just talking about. +

\... +
\... +
\... +
 
M: Okay, great, I hope everyone understands a lot better now. +
E: And I hope everyone could listen out for some of those key words. +
M: Right, so, now it's time for us to take a look at “fluency builder”. +
Voice: Fluency builder. +
E: So, with 'fluency builder' we try to help you increase your fluency. We take a ph… word 
or phrase that you already know and show you how to say it a little bit more naturally, a
little bit more like a native English speaker. +
M: Right, and we have three of these words for you today. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Let's start with the first one. Okay, so, often students will say something like… +
E: “I'll be here soon”. +
M: Or… +
E: “I will arrive soon”. +
M: Right, and these sentences are correct. +
E: They're totally fine, but I think there's a better way to say this. +
M: Right, and we heard it in the dialogue, so, let's listen to what the person in the dialogue 
said.
Phrase 1: The CEO will be here any minute. The CEO will be here any minute. +
M: Okay, so, be here any minute, he'll be here any minute. It just sounds a little bit more 
natural. +
E: Yeah, I think I use this phrase quite often, he’ll be here any minute. +
M: He'll be here soon. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Great. Okay, so, let's move on to our second phrase for fluency builder. +
E: So, this phrase will help you to learn how to say “I'm thinking about something” in a 
better sounding way. +
M: Right, so, you can say something like “We are thinking about a sales strategy”. +
E: Or “That sounds like something we should think about”. +
M: Right, and it's perfectly correct. +
E: Yeah, there's no problem with this. +
M: But in the dialogue we heard something a little bit different, so, let's listen to it. 
Phrase 2: It sounds like something we should consider. It sounds like something we should
consider. +
M: So, consider sounds like a pretty natural way of saying it, right? +
E: Yeah, and you know what, I think it sounds really kind of smart. +
M: Yeah, it sounds more formal even, at times. +
E: A little more professional. +
M: Yeah. +
E: Yeah. +
M: It's a good word. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Okay, brilliant! So, let's move on to our third word. +
E: Marco you already said our third word. +
M: Hehe. Oh, yeah, I actually did. Brilliant, um, that's a great word right there. +
E: Yeah. A lot of people might say “That's a great idea!” or “Great!”, but in the dialogue we 
heard another way of saying this same idea.
Phrase 2: That’s a brilliant idea. That’s a brilliant idea. +
M: Okay, so, this is great, but I would have to say that it's a little bit more British English. +
E: Yeah, I'd agree with you there, but I also think it sort of gives more power to this idea 
that it's a good idea. Brilliant idea! +
M: That it's a really, really good idea. +
E: Yeah, yeah. +
M: And I like that word. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Okay, so, we're ready to listen to our dialogue again, a third time, but at its normal 
speed. +

M: Alright, so, listening to this dialogue makes you think about this boss. I'm pretty sure 
everyone has had a manger or a… supervisor that's similar to this guy. +
E: Yeah, this boss - a clerk. I would have to say he sounds like a terrible person to work for. +
M: Hehe. Yeah, that's true. If you're a manager, you want to motivate your employees. +
E: I think it's the most important thing a manger does is to encourage his or her employees 
and to help support them to grow and to be better people in the job and this guys is totally
not doing this. +
M: And you can tell, because they are a little bit scared of talking and he cuts them off 
with saying “Oh, it's a bad idea, give me a better idea” and stuff like that. +
E: Yeah, I could never work for guy like this. +
M: Hehe. +
E: You know, my first boss that I had when I first entered the workforce, um, I was in a 
very junior position and I was working for a large company and the General Manger of the
company, he was amazing, he was so encouraging. He knew every single employee's name,
first name, and he would, you know, make an effort to stop and say “Hello” and ask them
how things were going. And, you know what, this left me with such a good feeling about the
company that I really wants to work hard for this company and try my best. And I think that
I've never… met such a great boss as this guy. +
M: No, I think that's true. Definitely, if you have a boss that's encouraging and motivating 
like that, it makes you work harder and makes you feel part of a really special team and
that's something we can all agree on and I'm sure all our managers out there do the same.
Well, you know what, I hope some of our listeners log on to our website and maybe they
can tell us some experiences with bad managers or good managers or if they are managers,
how they handle things. +
E: Yeah, and hopefully they can use some of these great phrases that we talked about 
today. +
M: Great, so, be sure everyone to visit our website at englishpod.com and… where you 
can find a lot of other information and really good resources to continue improving your
English. +
E: That's right, so, thanks for listening today everyone, and until next time, this is… Good 
bye! +
M: Bye! +
