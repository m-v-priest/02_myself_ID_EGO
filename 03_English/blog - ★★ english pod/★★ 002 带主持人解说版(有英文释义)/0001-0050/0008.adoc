Hello English learners and welcome back to EnglishPod. +
My name is Marco. +
And I'm Erica. +
How are you, Erica? +
Marco, I'm doing really well today. +
You're excited? +
Uh-huh. +
We've got a great lesson for everyone. +
Yes, we have a really common situation /where we're going to use real English, right? +
Yep. +
Everyday English. +
English that people really use. +
And that's what we want you to learn. +
What are we talking about today specifically (特意，专门地；明确地，具体地；具体来说，确切地说)? 我们今天具体要聊什么呀？ +
Today we have a really common situation /that is a little bit embarrassing. +

[.my2]
今天要讲的是一个非常常见，但有点让人尴尬的场景。

Alright, an embarrassing situation. +
So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time /and it's going to be kind of fast. +
Yeah, but don't worry if you don't understand everything /because after 10 minutes you'll understand everything. +
Perfect. +
Alright, let's listen. +

|Nick, how's it going? +
Oh, hey. +
What are you doing in this neighborhood? 你在这附近（neighborhood）干什么呢？  +
Do you live around here? +
Actually, my office is right around the corner 在拐角处. +
It was great /to meet you last week at the conference 会议，研讨会. +
I really enjoyed our conversation /about foreign investment. +
Yeah, yeah, it was really interesting. +
You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry 我现在有点赶时间 /but here's my card 名片. +
We should definitely meet up 相约见面 again /and continue our discussion. +
Sure, you still have my contact details, right? +
You know what? +
This is really embarrassing /but your name has just slipped my mind 我记不起来了. +
Can you remind me? +
Sure. +
My name is Anna Faris. +
Don't worry about it. +
It happens to me all the time. +
I'm terrible with 不擅长 names too. +
|===



Wow, Nick forgot her name. +
Yeah, that's happened to me a couple of times /and I'm going to tell you about it /a little bit later. +
Okay, alright, well let's start with our three _language takeaways_. +
So our first word on our language takeaway is _in a bit of a hurry_ 我有点着急,我有点赶时间. +
In a bit of a hurry. +
In a bit of a hurry. +
In a bit of a hurry. +
So Nick was in a hurry. +
Yeah, that's right. +
This is a great phrase. +
So let's listen to three examples of how you can use this phrase. +

Example one. +
Can you drive faster? +
I'm in a bit of a hurry. +

Example two. +
I can't talk  right now. 我现在没法跟你聊 +
I'm in a bit of a hurry. +

Example three. +
I'm in a bit of a hurry /so I'll check 检查，核对；查看，查询 these files later. +

Okay, so it's clear now. +
Basically it means that /you don't have time.
You're moving really quickly. 你得赶紧行动(离开)  +
Okay, perfect. +
Now let's look at our second _language takeaway_ word /and it's _contact details_ 联系方式. +
Contact details. +
Contact details. +
Contact details. +
So what are your contact details? +
Basically, this is the information you can find on your business card. +
Alright, so we have /like 就像,如同 our name, our telephone number. +
Your email address, perhaps your mobile phone number. +
So all the useful information /so people can *get in touch with* 与……取得联系 you. +
Yep, so people can phone (v.) you or email you. +
Okay, so _contact details_. 这就是 “contact details”（联系方式）。 +
Great. +

Okay, so our third word is _slipped my mind_ （某事）被我忘了、我想不起（某事）了. +
Slipped my mind. +
Slipped my mind. +
Slipped my mind. +
So this is a funny phrase. +
It's kind of strange, right? +
Yeah, slipped my mind. +
It sounds very weird. +
Exactly. +
Okay, so now we're going to listen to two examples of this phrase. +
Try and see /if you can figure out what it means. +

Example one. +
I'm sorry /I forgot to respond to your email. +
It just *slipped my mind*. +

Example two. +
Don't you know /what day it is today? +
Oh, it's your birthday. +
It completely slipped my mind. +

Ah, so _slipped my mind_ is like I forgot. +
You forgot something. +
Uh-huh, so... +
Accidentally  意外地，偶然地； 意外失误地. +
Right. +

Okay, great.
Now it's time for putting it together. +
Alright, Erica, why don't you tell our listeners /what _putting it together_ is? +
Well, putting it together helps you put language together. +
It helps you be more fluent /by knowing (v.) _how words **fit together**_ 组合在一起. +

[.my2]
通过了解词汇该如何搭配，能让大家的表达更流利。

Great, so let's look at our first phrase today. +
And it's #around here# 在这附近. +
Around here. +
Around here. +
Around here. +
So this is like _close by_ 在附近,在旁边. +
Close by, right. +
I can say, for example, is there a bank _around here_? +
Yeah, yeah. +
So that's /*is there* a bank _close to here_? +
Exactly. +
Exactly.  +

Now, this phrase, around here, we can change it a little bit /and it means something a little bit different. +
Right. +
I could say, Marco, there's a great restaurant #right around the corner# 就在转角处. +
Right, and that would mean /there is a great restaurant on the other street. +
Yep. +
Around the corner. +
Yep. +
Great. +

Or we have another example. +
We can say #_around there_#. +
Around there. +
Right. +
So, for example, I can say, Los Angeles is a great city. +
I used to live (v.) around there (在那周围). 我以前住在那附近 +
So you used to live near Los Angeles. +
Exactly. +
Alright. +
It's a really good phrase and it's really common. +
Yep. +
Now our next phrase and putting it together is _terrible with_ 不擅长. +
Terrible with. +
Terrible with. +
Terrible with. +
So we have a couple of examples /that will show you how this phrase works. +

Example one. +
You're terrible with numbers.
You can't even remember your own telephone number. +

Example two. +
I'm terrible with directions 方向；方位. I'm always getting lost. +

[.my2]
我记路（directions）特别差（terrible with directions）。


Example three. +
I'm terrible with faces 我不擅长认脸. I can never remember what people look like. +

Wow, I understand that. +
I'm also terrible with numbers.
I can barely add two plus two. 我连二加二都快算不出来了 +
Well, yeah, I guess not everyone is _a numbers person_ ​一个擅长与数字打交道的人；数学好的人；对数字敏感的人. +
I'm terrible with faces.
I sometimes forget what people look like. +
Really? +
Yeah.  +
So I think /it's time now for us to listen to our dialogue a second time. +
Okay, this time the dialogue will be a little bit slower. +
Right. +
So try and listen 试着听听看 for some of the words /we've just talked about. +

\... +
\... +
\... +

So it's more clear now. +
You can understand a lot better, right? +
Yeah, that's true. +
Great. +

So now it's time for us to take a look at Fluency Builder. +
Fluency Builder. +
So with Fluency Builder, we take some very simple phrases /and show you how you can be more fluent or how you can... +
Sound more native. +
Yeah. +
Great. +
In the beginning of the dialogue, Anna said, Nick, #how's it going#? 最近怎么样呀, 怎么样；还好吗 +
Yeah, this is a great phrase. +
It sounds (v.) really, really natural. +
You know, sometimes I hear students say, #how are you#? +
Or #how are you doing?# +
Those are two great phrases, but this one sounds really, really natural. +
It just sounds more casual. 而且更随意 +
Yeah, let's listen again to that phrase /from the dialogue. +
How's it going? +
How's it going? +
Great. +
So next time /that you find a friend on the street, you can just say, hey, how's it going 怎么样；还好吗? +
Yeah. +
So Marco, have you ever forgotten someone's name? +
Yeah, it's happened to me a couple of times. +
And actually, the most embarrassing situation was that /I forgot a family member's name. +
No 不会吧, a family member's name. +
We had _like_ 算是,好像,那个 a family reunion 重聚；团聚 /and there were a lot of aunts and uncles and cousins /that I hadn't seen _in a while_ 一段时间.  +

[.my1]
.title
====
.We had _like_ a family reunion
*这里的 ​​like​​ 不是动词“喜欢”的意思，而是英语口语中常见的一个​​语气词或填充词​​。*

它的作用主要有以下几点：

1.​​*表示不确定或模糊化*​​：**说话者并不是在精确地描述一个正式的家庭“重聚”，可能只是一个比较随意的、像重聚一样的家庭聚会。**用 like来软化语气，使其听起来不那么绝对。

对比： +
•We had a family reunion.(我们举办了一次家庭聚会。) —— 肯定、正式。 +
•We had, like, a family reunion.(我们办了个，嗯，算是家庭聚会吧。) —— 随意、不精确。

2.​​**作为填充词，用于思考或停顿​​：类似于中文里的“呃”、“那个”、“嘛”。**说话者在组织语言时，用 like来占据短暂的停顿，让话语不那么生硬。 +
•例如：And I was... like... uh oh...(然后我就…那个…哎呀…)

3.​​举例或引述内容​​（在这个具体句子里不是主要功能，但也是like的常见用法）：有时会用来引出后面要说的具体例子或想法。

所以，整句话 We had like a family reunion...地道的翻译可以处理为：​​ +
•​​“我们办了个​​ ​​算是​​ ​​家庭聚会吧…”​​ +
•​​“我们搞了个​​ ​​类似​​ ​​家庭聚会的活动…”​​ +
•​​“我们​​ ​​嘛​​ ​​，就是聚了一下…”​ +

And I just forgot one of my uncle's names.  +
And I was...  +
Uh oh, that's pretty embarrassing 令人尴尬的；难堪的.  +
So what did you do?  +
Well, I had to ask one of my other cousins.  +
I'm like, hey, who is that guy?  +
He's like, oh, that's Uncle John.  +
I'm like, oh, man, I totally forgot.  +
Yeah, so it was really embarrassing /because I didn't know _what to call him_ 怎么称呼他.  +
So I just called him Uncle /because I didn't know his name.  +
Hi, Uncle.  +
Yeah.  +
Oh, yeah.  +
So /when that happens to me, when I'm in a business setting 场合；环境, sometimes `主` what I do `系` is _I *ask for* someone's card_.  +

[.my2]
所以当我遇到这种情况，在商务场合时，我有时会问对方要名片。

Yeah, that's a good technique 技巧；方法.  +
Yeah.  +
Or sometimes /I might ask them to write down their email /because usually their full name *is spelled 拼写 out* 用字母拼写;详细解释 on their email address.  +

[.my2]
因为通常邮箱地址会显示他们的全名。

So that's my trick 窍门；诀窍 /when I've forgotten someone's name.  +
That's a good trick.  +

And I guess a lot of our listeners can take your advice on that.  +
OK, so I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue one more time, this time at natural speed.  +


\... +
