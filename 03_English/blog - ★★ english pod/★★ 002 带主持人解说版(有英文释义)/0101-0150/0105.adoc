M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name isMarco. +
E: And I’m Erica. +
M: Today we’re bringing you a lesson about the office, so, something related to business, 
right? +
E: That’s right, and in this lesson we’re learning, um, language you can use to tell someone 
they did a good job. +
M: Okay, so, a job well done. +
E: Uhu. +
M: You want to praise somebody. +
E: That’s right, so, we’re gonna listen in as a manager praises his employee on a 
presentation. +
M: Okay, so, before we listen to the dialogue, let’s take a look very quickly at “vocabulary 
preview”. +
Voice: Vocabulary preview. +
E: Well, we’re gonna hear both of these words in the dialogue and the first one is a wiz. +
M: Wiz. +
E: To be a wiz. +
M: Okay, so, it’s an adjective – somebody is a wiz. [NOTE: might be an adjective, but 
here, actually, it’s a noun] +
E: That’s right and wiz comes from the word wizard. +
M: Okay, so, kind of like a… like a witch, but a guy-witch. +
E: Yeah, man-witch, um, but, so, a wiz is someone who is really good at something. +
M: Okay, so, I can say “David is a computer wiz”. +
E: Or “Anthony is a math wiz”. +
M: Okay, so, he is really good at computers or he is really good at math or he knows a lot 
about math. +
E: Exactly. +
M: Okay, and, uh, our second word. +
E: Well, we’re gonna hear about slides. +
M: Slides. +
E: PowerPoint slides. +
M: PowerPoint slides, okay, so, everyone knows PowerPoint, right? +
E: Uhu, a computer program. +
M: A computer program that you use to make presentations. +
E: And a slide is one page in that presentation. +
M: Okay, so, if you have ten pages in your PowerPoint presentation, you basically have ten 
slides. +
E: Exactly. +
M: Very good, so, now let’s listen to the dialogue for the first time and we’re gonna see 
what’s happening in this business meeting. +
A: And so, that concludes my outline for our market- 
ing strategy next year. Thank you very much for
your time. +
B: Hey, that was quite the presentation! Honestly, I 
was completely blown away by your strategy out-
line. I’ve gotta say, Alex, you really wowed me
today. +
A: Aw, come on; it was nothing. I’m just doing my 
job. +
B: No, I think you deserve some recognition here; I 
mean, if I look back on your previous presenta-
tions, this is a huge improvement. +
A: Well, Kristin did give me a hand with the slides. 
She’s a real wiz on PowerPoint. +
B: And I saw that you took on board my feedback 
about pricing strategies. I really appreciate you
taking the time to think though my suggestions. +
A: Yeah, well, that was some good advice. You made 
some really good points. +
B: Well, I just wanted to say well done. Really you 
did a great job. +
E: Alright, well, it sounds like the employee is a little bit, mm, shy or… or embarrassed by 
receiving all of these compliments. +
M: Yeah, I guess he is kind of, uh, being humble about it. +
E: Uhu, exactly! So, why don’t we move on to the language now? There’re so many really 
useful phrases in this dialogue, um, that I think we’re just gonna focus on those today, so,
let’s get started with “fluency builder”. +
Voice: Fluency builder. +
M: Okay, so, today on fluency builder let’s start with our first phrase. The boss was so 
impressed with the presentation that he said “I wascompletely blown away” [NOTE:
actually, the boss was a woman, so… she said] +
E: To be completely blown away. +
M: Okay, so, to be completely blown away. +
E: Or to be blown away. +
M: Alright, so, what does that mean to be blown away? +
E: To be surprised, um, and amazed, but in a very positive way. +
M: Okay, so, I can say “I’m surprised”, “I’m amazed”, uh, but I’m still not very clear on this. 
Why don’t we listen to a couple of examples of how we could use this phrase? +
Voice: Example one. +
A: Karl blew me away with his knowledge of political science. +
Voice: Example two. +
B: I was blown away when I heard that Jennie and Rick had gotten married. They have 
known each other for less than a month. +
Voice: Example three. +
C: My parents were blown away when they found out I had a tattoo. +
E: Okay, so, I think that’s a little bit clearer now and this is a wonderful way to give your 
praise to someone when they do something really amazing. +
M: Okay, so, completely blown away. You… +
E: Uhu. +
M: Blew me away. +
E: That’s right. +
M: Now, what about our second word? +
E: Well, it’s quite similar. Um, the boss said that you really wowed me. +
M: You wowed me. +
E: To wow someone. +
M: Okay, so, it’s spelled W-O-W, wow. +
E: So, when you wow someone, you make that person go wow. +
M: Okay, so, you impress somebody. +
E: Yep. +
M: To wow someone. I can use it as a verb. +
E: Yeah. +
M: You wowed me; I wanna wow you. +
E: Well, I want you wow me. +
M: Okay, so, uh, wow! Now, let’s take a look at our third phrase. The guy, he’s a little bit 
shy, he’s trying to be a little bit humble about, you know, receiving so many compliments,
so, he says “Oh, it was nothing”. +
E: It was nothing. +
M: Really, it was nothing. +
E: It was nothing. +
M: So, that’s a way of saying “It wasn’t hard” or “It’s not a big deal”. +
E: It’s not that important. +
M: Exactly, so, if somebody’s saying “Wow! Thank you so much for lending me your car”, 
don’t worry about it. +
E: It was nothing. +
M: It was nothing. +
E: Yeah, uhu. +
M: Alright. +
E: It’s k… it’s a polite way, actually, to respond to a nice compliment. +
M: Very good, so, before we move on to our next phrase, let’s listen to a couple of 
examples with it was nothing. +
Voice: Example one. +
A: Thanks for lending me your car this week. I really appreciate it. +
B: It’s okay really, it was nothing. +
Voice: Example two. +
C: I can’t believe you organized the surprised birthday party. Thank you so much. +
D: Don’t worry about it, it was nothing. +
E: Okay, so, I think that’s petty clear. Now, our final phrase here for fluency builder. Um, 
the… the employee said that Kirsten gave him a hand. +
M: Okay, so, to give someone a hand. +
E: Give me a hand. +
M: Give me a hand. +
E: Basically, to help someone. +
M: Help me or… +
E: Yeah. +
M: Assist me. +
E: Uhu. +
M: Okay, so, to help someone… “give me a hand” or “let me give you a hand”. +
E: That’s right. +
M: Alright, very good, so, great phrases in fluency builder today. I think it’s time for us to 
listen to the dialogue for the second time. Uh, we’re gonna slow it down a little bit, so, we
can catch all these phrases and then we’ll come back. +
A: And so, that concludes my outline for our market- 
ing strategy next year. Thank you very much for
your time. +
B: Hey, that was quite the presentation! Honestly, I 
was completely blown away by your strategy out-
line. I’ve gotta say, Alex, you really wowed me
today. +
A: Aw, come on; it was nothing. I’m just doing my 
job. +
B: No, I think you deserve some recognition here; I 
mean, if I look back on your previous presenta-
tions, this is a huge improvement. +
A: Well, Kristin did give me a hand with the slides. 
She’s a real wiz on PowerPoint. +
B: And I saw that you took on board my feedback 
about pricing strategies. I really appreciate you
taking the time to think though my suggestions. +
A: Yeah, well, that was some good advice. You made 
some really good points. +
B: Well, I just wanted to say well done. Really you 
did a great job. +
E: Okay, so, like we said before there’s a… a lot of really helpful phrases in here, um, and 
we’re gonna look at a few more of these in “putting it together”. +
Voice: Putting it together. +
M: Okay, so, let’s start with the first phrase. Uh, the boss was quite impressed with him and 
he said “That was quite the presentation”. +
E: That was quite the presentation! +
M: Alright, quite the presentation. +
E: So, this phrase quite the presentation, it means “it was good”, right? +
M: Uhu. +
E: It was… it was special. +
M: It was… it was very good. +
E: Yep, now, we can shake the noun presentation out and replace it with any 
other noun. [NOTE: shake out = throw away; put aside] +
M: Alright, so, I can say “Bob is quite the basketball player”. +
E: Uhu. Why don’t we listen now for a few more examples? 
 Voice: Example one. +
A: I heard you’re quite the dancer. Can you teach me some moves? +
Voice: Example two. +
B: Karl is quite the ladies man. He is very good when it comes to talking to girls. +
Voice: Example three. +
C: Nancy is quite gifted at math. She can solve any math problem you give her. +
M: So, you’re saying in a… in a very good way that something is very good. +
E: Or special. +
M: Very special. +
E: Yep, uhu. +
M: Alright, so, the boss was very impressed with the employee and he said “And I saw that 
you took on board my feedback”. +
E: To take on board my feedback. +
M: Okay, so, take on board something. +
E: Uhu. So, here my feedback is, uh, my suggestions, right? +
M: Uhu. +
E: And when you take on board my feedback, you accept my feedback and you use it. +
M: Okay, so, I can say, for example, uh, “I want you to take on board my ideas”. +
E: Uhu, or “Jenny took on board a few of my suggestions, I was really happy”. +
M: Okay, very good, so, to take on board – to accept and use. +
E: Alright, so, take on board feedback, take on board suggestion[s], take on board ideas. +
M: Okay, very good. And we have one more phrase on putting it together today – to think 
something through. +
E: To think it through. +
M: Okay, so, think it through. +
E: So, here the boss said that he took the time to think through my suggestions. +
M: Uhu, so, think through. What does that mean? +
E: Um, to think carefully about all of the details of something. +
M: Okay, so, to take into consideration all the aspects. +
E: Right, so, why don’t we give an example? +
M: Uhu. +
E: Um, if you’re thinking through a plan, right, you don’t just think about the end. +
M: Uhu. +
E: The outcome. +
M: Okay. +
E: You wanna think about all of the small details, the steps in that plan. +
M: Okay, so, maybe I wanna buy a new car, but… +
E: Yeah. +
M: It’s a lot of money, so… +
E: Yeah. +
M: I really have to think it though. +
E: So, you have to think carefully about everything that is involved in buying the new car. +
M: Right. +
E: All the money you’re gonna have to, you know, not spend on parties and… +
M: Exactly, you have to think it through, you have to analyze it very carefully. +
E: That’s right, so, let’s give a few examples of how we can use this phrase. “Hey, Marco, 
have you thought through my suggestions?” +
M: I can say “You guys are very young, I think you should think it through before you get 
married”. +
E: Hm, good advise. +
M: Okay, so, to think it through. +
E: Okay, so, um, three great phrases and why don’t we hear them one more time in our 
dialogue? +
A: And so, that concludes my outline for our market- 
ing strategy next year. Thank you very much for
your time. +
B: Hey, that was quite the presentation! Honestly, I 
was completely blown away by your strategy out-
line. I’ve gotta say, Alex, you really wowed me
today. +
A: Aw, come on; it was nothing. I’m just doing my 
job. +
B: No, I think you deserve some recognition here; I 
mean, if I look back on your previous presenta-
tions, this is a huge improvement. +
A: Well, Kristin did give me a hand with the slides. 
She’s a real wiz on PowerPoint. +
B: And I saw that you took on board my feedback 
about pricing strategies. I really appreciate you
taking the time to think though my suggestions. +
A: Yeah, well, that was some good advice. You made 
some really good points. +
B: Well, I just wanted to say well done. Really you 
did a great job. +
M: Okay, great dialogue and, uh, some interesting phrases for giving praise, right? That’s I 
think very important in the workplace. +
E: Yeah, and, you know what, I read recently that something like 6 out of every 10 
employees don’t get regular praise from their boss. +
M: Hm, yeah, it’s very important and in some cultures, well, it’s not very common to praise 
or to give positive feedback to their employees. +
E: Yeah, but I think, um, for… for western employees, actually, it’s really important and it 
helps them work harder, the more… +
M: Uhu. +
E: The more, um, times they hear “Job well done!” +
M: Yeah, very good. So, now you have the tools that maybe you can use with your 
employees or… +
E: With your friends. +
M: With your friends. +
E: Yep. +
M: Okay, so, if you have any questions, comments or doubts, please come to our 
website englishpod.com. +
E: Yep, Marco and I are always around to help you out, so, um, until next time, thanks for 
listening and… Good bye! +
M: Bye!
