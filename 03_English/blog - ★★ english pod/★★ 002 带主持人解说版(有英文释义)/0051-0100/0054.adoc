M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. +
E: And I’m Erica. +
M: And we’re gonna be looking at our fifth episode （电视、广播的）一集；片段 of our famous love story. +

[.my2]
今天我们要继续讲解经典爱情故事的第五集。

E: Yes, I’m sorry I love you. +

[.my2]
没错，就是《对不起，我爱你》。

M: I’m sorry I love you. +
E: Part five. +
M: Okay. Hehe. Part five. So if you haven’t listened to the first four /I suggest 建议；提议 you go do that first, because… +
E: You’re gonna be a little bit lost 困惑的；迷失的. +
M: But it’s getting really good. 不过剧情现在越来越精彩了 +
E: Yeah, and so /*so* good *that* I don’t think we can even say what… +

[.my2]
精彩到我们都没法提前透露...

M: What’s gonna happen next. Hehe.  没法透露接下来会发生什么。+
E: No, we can’t say /what the key 关键的；核心的 language is. +

[.my2]
对，我们没法提前说重点语言点是什么。

M: Oh, yeah, we can’t preview 预习；预先查看 anything /because it’s… we want to surprise 使惊讶；使惊喜 you. +
E: Yes. +
M: But we can tell you this, wha… what’s *going on* 进行，发生? 上次讲到哪儿了 +
E: Last time /we saw Veronica and Steven, um, they broke up 分手，结束关系，right? +
M: Right. +
E: And Veronica was with her friend /and feeling really terrible 糟糕的；难受的 /and then Steven suddenly came to sing a beautiful song. +
M: So this is continuing on that. +

[.my2]
今天的剧情就接着上次的讲。

E: Right. +
M: Okay. So let’s listen to the dialogue /and then we’ll come back and talk about some of the difficult vocabulary 词汇 you might find. +

|A: Honey, of course I forgive 原谅；宽恕 you! I love you so much! I’ve really missed 想念；思念 you. I was wrong /*to get upset* 感到心烦意乱 over nothing. 我不该无缘无故地生气 +
B: I’m sorry I haven’t called or anything, but right after you decided you wanted a break （关系的）暂时中断；休息，I was called up 召集；召唤 north /to put out 扑灭；熄灭 some major 重大的；主要的 forest fires! I was in the middle of nowhere 不存在的地方，荒芜的地区, working day and night, trying to prevent 预防；阻止 the blaze 火焰；烈火 from spreading 扩散；蔓延！It was pretty intense 紧张的；激烈的. +

[.my2]
抱歉我一直没给你打电话，其实你说想暂时分开之后，我就被派去北部扑灭大型森林火灾了！我待在荒无人烟的地方，没日没夜地工作，就为了阻止火势蔓延！那场面太紧张了。

A: Oh, honey, I’m glad you’re okay! But I have some exciting news... I think I’m pregnant 怀孕的！+
B: Really? Wow, that’s amazing 令人惊奇的；了不起的！This is great news! I’ve always wanted to be a father! We’ll go to the doctor /first thing in the morning!   我们明天一早就去看医生 +
C: We have your test results 结果；成绩 back 我们已经收到了您的测试结果,你们的检查结果出来了 /and, indeed 确实；实在，you are pregnant. Let’s see here... everything seems to be in order. Your approximate 大约的；近似的 _due date_ 预产期（孕妇预计分娩的日期） is October twenty-seventh _two thousand and nine_ (2009 年 10 月 27 日), so that means that /the baby was conceived 受孕；构思  on February third, two thousand and nine. +
B: Are you sure? Are these things accurate 准确的；精确的？+
C: Well, yes sir, they are. +
A: What’s wrong? Why are you asking these questions? +
B: This baby isn’t mine! I was away /the first week of February /at a training seminar 研讨会；培训会;讲习会！+

[.my2]
2月的第一周, 我正在参加一个培训研讨会，根本不在这儿！

A: I... I... no, it can’t be...

M: Alright, so more drama 戏剧性事件；情节 in our love story. +
E: Oh my god. +
M: Things were going well /and now more bad news. +

[.my2]
之前事情明明进展得很顺利，现在又出了坏消息。

E: Yeah, or good news. +
M: Or good news. +
E: I… +
M: We’re not sure yet. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Okay, let’s take a look at the vocabulary first /in “language takeaway”. +

Voice: Language takeaway. +
E: Well, we’re gonna look （此处修正原文 “looking” 为 “look”，与情态动词 “gonna” 搭配需用动词原形）at four words now, um, the first one, blaze. +
M: Blaze 火焰；烈火. +
E: Blaze. +
M: Blaze. +
E: So this noun 名词 is, um, another word for a fire, right? +
M: For a big fire. +
E: A really big fire. +
M: Uhu, the blaze. +
E: Uhu. +
M: So basically it’s like a flame 火焰 of the fire. +

[.my2]
所以本质上它指的就是火的火焰。

E: Yes, this one is a little bit difficult, so I think /we can use some examples to show us /how to use this word. +

Voice: Example one. +
A: The blaze is spreading quickly, we need to evacuate 疏散；撤离 these people. +

Voice: Example two. +
B: We have to go in there /and save those people from the blaze. +

M: Okay, so, it’s clear now, blaze. +
E: Uhu. +

M: Let’s look at our next word, conceived. +
E: Conceived 受孕；构思. +
M: The past participle  过去分词 of conceive. +
E: Right, conceive. +
M: Conceive is a nice fancy 复杂的；精致的;昂贵的；奢华的 word. +
E: Yes, and what does it mean, Marco? +
M: To create 创造；创作. +
E: Oh, like how you side-stepped (v.)回避；绕开;；横跨一步躲避 it. +

[.my2]
哦，你这解释还挺委婉的。

M: So, it means to create. You can conceive a baby. +
E: Yes. +
M: You can conceive an idea. +
E: Yes. +
M: So, it basically means to create. +
E: Yes, um, most commonly 通常；一般 with the baby, okay. +

[.my2]
不过最常用的场景还是和 “怀孕” 相关

M: Yeah, yeah, conceive. So, after the baby was conceived. +
E: Yep. +

M: We have a due date. +
E: Yes. +
M: We all know that /it’s nine months later. +
E: Yes. +
M: Approximately  大约，大概. +
E: Yep, due date. +
M: So, the _due date_ is the date of birth 出生，basically. +
E: It’s the doctor’s guess 猜测；推测 /when the birth 出生，诞生 would be. +
M: Would be. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Okay. +
E: When you go to the doctor and say "when will my baby be born", he’ll… he’ll say "well, your _due date_ is… bla-bla-bla". +
M: Nine months later. +
E: Yeah. +

M: Okay. And our last word in _language takeaway_, accurate. +
E: Accurate. +
M: Accurate. +
E: Accurate. +
M: Now, the due dates aren’t accurate. +
E: Right. +
M: That means /they’re not one hundred percent sure. +
E: Uhu. +
M: Or precise 精确的；准确的. +
E: Yes. So, when something is accurate /it’s absolutely 绝对地；完全地 certain 确定的；肯定的. +
M: Absolutely precise. +
E: Yes. +
M: One hundred percent. Okay, so, accurate. Let’s listen to some more examples of _how we can use accurate_. +

Voice: Example one. +
A: A blood test 血液检测 is the most accurate way /of finding out if you’re pregnant. +

Voice: Example two. +
B: These reports 报告 are not accurate, John. We checked 检查；核对 and discovered a lot of mistakes 错误；失误. +

Voice: Example three. +
C: This new software helps us calculate 计算；核算 costs 成本；费用 in a very accurate way. +

M: With those examples /I think we’re ready to listen to this dialogue again. This time /we’re gonna slow it down, right? +
E: Yeah, in case 以防；万一 you, um, were *#so#* (如此...以至于) shocked 震惊的；惊愕的 by what happened /*#that#* you couldn’t follow 理解；跟上. +

[.my2]
免得大家因为剧情太震惊, 而跟不上对话内容。

\... +
\... +
\... +

M: Alright, so *continuing on* without drama 抛开戏剧性的剧情, let’s take a look at some interesting phrases 短语 in “fluency builder”. +

Voice: Fluency builder. +
E: Well, we’ve got three phrases for you, um, the first one is _the middle of nowhere_ (不存在的地方，荒芜的地区) 荒郊野外;偏远地区；荒无人烟的地方. +
M: Middle of nowhere. +
E: Middle of nowhere. +
M: Middle of nowhere. +
E: This is, ah, kind of a funny one 这个短语还挺有意思的, but, um, I think /if we listen to some examples, it will help us to understand the meaning of this phrase. +

Voice: Example one. +
A: We are in the middle of nowhere. How can we find our way *back home* 回家? +

Voice: Example two. +
B: I was in the middle of nowhere, so I couldn’t even use my mobile phone 手机. +

Voice: Example three. +
C: It takes me two hours /to drive to your house. It’s in the middle of nowhere! +

M: Alright, so middle of nowhere, it means that /you’re lost. +
E: Yeah, you’re in a… in a place /with no cities or people or anything nearby 附近的；邻近的. +
M: Okay, so… just imagine (v.)想象；设想 yourself in the desert 沙漠. That would be _the middle of nowhere_. +
E: Yes, or, ah, in Canada. +
M: In Canada. Hehe. +
E: That would be the middle of nowhere. +
M: Alright, let’s take a look at our next phrase, #first thing in the morning# 一大早；清晨. +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.First thing in the morning 意思是"很早"还是"早上第一件事"? 也就是说, 它的意思是指时间, 还是指早上要做的事情?

答案是：两者兼有，但更侧重于“时间”，并用“事件”来指代时间。​​ +
*它的字面意思是“早上第一件事”，但其​​核心功能是用来指一个“非常早的时间点”​​。*

First thing in the morning​虽然可以是​“早上要做的第一件事”, 但**#在绝大多数情况下，这个短语是作为一个​​固定的时间状语​​来使用的，意思是：​​“一大清早”、“清晨时分”、“早晨一开始的时候”.#​​它强调的是​​一天中最早开始活动的那段时间​​，而不是具体指某一件“事”。**

- #*如果指“事件”*# (做主语或宾语)​​：
它通常是句子的核心，#*前面会有my, the, this等限定词。*# +
•例句：​​_##*The*## first thing in the morning_​​ is always the hardest. (早上的第一件事总是最难的。)

- #*如果指“时间”*# (做时间状语)​​：它通常位于句首或句尾，修饰整个句子，表示动作发生的时间。#*前面​​没有​​my, the等限定词。*# +
•例句：I'll call you ​​__first thing in the morning__​​. (我​​明天一大清早​​就给你打电话。)
====

E: First thing in the morning. +
M: First thing in the morning. +
E: First thing in the morning. +
M: So, when we talk about the _first thing_ /it means… +
E: Really really early 早的；早期的 in the morning. +
M: Really early. +
E: Yep. +
M: So. I can change it a little bit /and say, _first thing in the afternoon_ 下午一开头. +
E: Early in the afternoon. +
M: Or _first thing tomorrow morning_ 明天一大早. +
E: Right. +
M: Right? +
E: So, really early tomorrow. +
M: Okay. So, it’s a very common way of *referring to* 提到；谈及；说起 "very early". +
E: Yeah, it’s not like… /`主` _first thing in the morning_ `系` is like six o’clock in the morning, right? +
M: Right. +
E: But if you say "okay, I’ll *take care of* 处理；负责 that _first thing in the morning_" 我明天一早就处理这件事, you’ll do it right away 立刻；马上 in the morning. +
M: Right away. +
E: Uhu. +
M: Right /when you get to the office ???. +
E: Right. +

M: Okay. Let’s look at our last phrase, _seems (v.) to be in order_ 似乎没问题; 情况正常；井然有序. +
E: Seems to be in order. +
M: Everything seems to be in order. +
E: Uhu, so, everything is okay, everything’s normal 正常的；平常的. +
M: Everything seems to be normal. +
E: Yep. +
M: Everything looks okay. +
E: Yes. +
M: So, this is a very common phrase /when… people check your documents 文件；证件… +
E: Aha, yeah, that’s true. +
M: Or the reports. +
E: Yep. +
M: Ah, they’ll say "okay, all the papers 文件；票据 seem to be in order 看起来一切正常,没问题". +
E: Uhu. +
M: Very common. +
E: Yes, _good news_ when you’re pregnant /_that_ everything seems to be in order. +
M: Exactly. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Everything is normal. Alright, so let’s listen to this dramatic 戏剧性的；激动人心的 dialogue one more time /and we’ll come back and talk some more. +

... +
... +
... +

E: Well, Marco, um, what do you think about the situation 情况；形势？Wha… what would you do /if you were this guy? +
M: It’s complicated 复杂的；难懂的. +
E: I know. +
M: Ah, I don’t know what I would do. It seems like something, ah, very typical 典型的；有代表性的 of _soap operas_ 肥皂剧（以家庭纠纷、情感 drama 为主要内容的电视连续剧）. +

[.my2]
我也不知道该怎么做。这情节感觉就像肥皂剧里的经典桥段。

E: Yes. +
M: Hehe. Well, I don’t know /because she didn’t really deny 否认；否定 it… +
E: Uhu. +
M: In the end. She *didn’t say*, no, *right away*. +

[.my2]
她没立刻说 “不是这样的”。

E: Yeah, and… but she didn’t say like… oh. +
M: Yeah, she didn’t really accept 接受；承认 it. +
E: Yeah. +
M: So, it’s still a little bit difficult /to see _if maybe_ she cheated (v.)欺骗，哄骗 on 对… 不忠；背叛 him. +

[.my2]
目前还是有点难以判断, 她是否（可能）欺骗了他。

[.my1]
.案例
====
.if maybe
从严格的​​标准书面语法​​来看，​​“if maybe” 的连用是不规范、冗余的​​。因为 if（是否）和 maybe（可能）都表示不确定性，只需用一个即可。

更规范的写法​​： +
•...to see /if she cheated on him.（看看她​​是否​​欺骗了他。） +
•...to see /maybe she cheated on him.（看看她​​可能​​欺骗了他。）-- 这种用法在口语中常见，但书面语中不如 if正式。

尽管不规范，但在​​日常口语​​中，“if maybe” 的连用​​非常普遍​​。这是一种​​强调不确定性​​的语言习惯。

这种为了强调语气而“冗余”的现象在口语中很常见。 +
•​​“I don't know /_if perhaps_ you've heard...”​​ (我不知道你是否也许已经听说了……) +
•​​“Let's see /_whether maybe_ we can find it.”​​ (咱们看看是否也许能找到它。)

在书面语中，我们通常会删掉“perhaps”或“maybe”，但在口语中，它们的存在让语气更婉转、更不确定。

gemini: 在日常口语中，为了表达一种犹豫或不确定的语气，人们经常会自然地将 "if" 和 "maybe" 连用。
====

E: Yes. +
M: Or something.  或者是不是有别的情况。 +
E: Hey, guys, what do you think? Do you think Veronica cheated on Steven? +
M: Do you think it’s his baby? Maybe it’s not. Maybe the doctor is wrong. +
E: Maybe it’s the doctor’s baby. +
M: Maybe it’s… Hehe. +
E: Hehe. +
M: Anything could happen here /at EnglishPod, so send us your ideas 想法；观点 /and tell us what you think happens next… 告诉我们你们觉得接下来会发生什么  Ah, come to englishpod.com /where you can leave your questions, your comments 评论；意见. +
E: Yeah, and Marco and I are always around to, ah, answer your questions, respond to your comments. +
M: Exactly 正是如此，一点不错 /and we want to know _what you think will happen next_. +
E: Yes. +
M: Alright guys, so until next time… Bye! +
E: Bye!
