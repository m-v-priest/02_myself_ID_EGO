M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name isMarco. 
C: And my name is Catherine, so what are we talking about today, Marco? 
M: Well, we’re talking about one of my favorite topics, which arecomputers. 
C: Yes, you’re a little bit of a nerd. 
M: Uh, a little bit. 
C: Hehe. 
M: I love computers and technology and everything that’s related to it, so, uh, that’s what 
we’re gonna be looking at today; maybe we’re buying a new computer. 
C: Well, I anticipate learning something from this, because there’re a lot of those fancy big 
words that I don’t know that have to do with processors, and giga-fingle-tingle things. 
M: Hehe. 
C: So, uh, that’s gonna be coming up in a minute here, but, uh, first let’s just jump right in 
and take a listen to today’s dialogue. 
Customer: So can you fix it?
Sales Clerk: I’m sorry sir. This computer is not
broken or damaged. It’s simply
just too old! That’s why your pro-
grams and applications are run-
ning slow. There really isn’t much
I can do.
Customer: What do you mean? I bought this
computer just three years ago!
Sales Clerk: Yes, but technology is ever chang-
ing and technology is becoming
obsolete faster and faster!
Customer: Ok, I know where this is going.
How much will it cost me to get a
new computer?
Sales Clerk: Well, this desktop over here is our
latest model. It has a four gi-
gahertz processor with sixteen gi-
gabytes in RAM and a hard disk
with one terabyte. Of course, it
includes a mouse, keyboard and
desk speakers.
Customer: I have no idea what you are talk-
ing about. I just want to know if
it’s good and if I will be able to
play solitaire without the computer
crashing or freezing all the time!
Sales Clerk: This PC is top of the line and I
guarantee it will never freeze! If
it does, we’ll give you your money
back!
M: Alright, we’re back. Uh, I think it’s a very typical case. You’re going to get something 
fixed and they say: “We can’t fix it, you need a new one”. 
C: Yes and not only a new one, but a bigger and better and faster one. 
M: And more expensive, obviously. 
C: Obviously. 
M: Hehe. 
C: It’s called the upsell. 
M: The upsell, yeah. 
C: Hehe. Yeah. 
M: Alright, so there were some very difficult words, I think, because they’re very specific, 
related to technology and computers. So, uh, why don’t we look at those now in “language 
takeaway”? 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
M: Alright, so the first word we have today is when something is no longer in use. 
C: Okay, so this word is obsolete. 
M: It’s obsolete. 
C: Obsolete. We’re not just talking about like “oh, I haven’t touched that pen in like ten 
years”. We’re talking about a piece of technology that is no longer useful, because there’s 
something else that can do a better job. 
M: Right, and actually not only with, uh, technology. We also have words that are obsolete, 
right? 
C: Uhu, exactly, like thy or thine. 
M: Hehe. 
C: You or yours. 
M: Classical English. We don’t use “thy” anymore. 
C: No. 
M: But… 
C: Thou art very summery today, Marco. 
M: Hehe. But we don’t use that anymore. That’s obsolete English, right? 
C: Uhu. 
M: Or obsolete words. 
C: Exactly, so obsolete means it’s no longer of use. We have better and newer things in… in 
its place. 
M: Alright, and now moving on, when the salesman was describing the characteristics of the 
computer, uh, he had… he used some prefixesthat were a little bit strange, right? Like for 
example, giga-. 
C: Giga what? 
M: Giga. Hehe. 
C: Alright, so these are actually prefixes that have to do with numbers and so, this is not 
just a computer thing, this is a math thing or a science thing, so… 
M: Uhu. 
C: Okay, so we’ve got three different prefixes. A prefix is something we tack on at the 
beginning of a word. So we’ve had… we have, uh,hertz, uh, or byte, right? These are little 
bits of a computer – byte. 
M: Right, so you have like megabytes. 
C: Megabytes, we’ve all heard before, that’s the smallest here. Uh, we’ve got megabytes, 
but bigger than mega, we’ve got gigabytes. 
M: A giga… yeah, so now, for example, the… the hard drives are two hundred and fifty 
gigabytes. 
C: You might even hear someone say gigs. We’ve got a… 
M: Gigs, yeah. 
C: Two hundred fifty gig hard drive. 
M: Yeah. 
C: But, uh, what’s bigger than giga? 
M: Now it’s the terabyte. 
C: Ooh, tera sounds like boom-boom-boom-boom… 
M: Yeah. 
C: Huge! 
M: I actually wondered what would happen after, uh, gigabyte, cause so much information 
already and now it’s the terabyte, so it’s like one thousand gigabytes. 
C: So that’s like two hundred movies. 
M: That’s probably more than that. It’s amazing… 
C: Yeah. 
M: The amount of storage you can have and how small it actually is. 
C: So mega, giga, terra. 
M: Right. 
C: Going from littlest to biggest. 
M: Alright, uh, and well, he described a four gigahertz processor. 
C: Mm, okay, so the processor is our next word and this is actually something that, um… 
that determines how fast your computer is gonna run. 
M: So it comes from the word to process, right? 
C: Right. 
M: To like calculate or to think… 
C: Do, even. 
M: Uhu. 
C: Uhu. 
M: To do. So you have different examples like a word processor. 
C: Right, so that’s like Microsoft Word, it’s allows you to make Word documents. 
M: Uhu. 
C: You can also say to process, uh, data. You’re trying to calculate it. 
M: Uhu, but in this case a processor is like a little brain that’s the center of the computer 
and that’s where all the information gets processed. 
C: Yeah, so it’s the brain of the computer, essentially. 
M: Uhu. 
C: And the bigger it is, the faster it can go. 
M: Exactly. And, well, if you don’t have a very good processor, your computer is bound 
to freeze. 
C: Ooh, okay, so freezing is another keyword, especially when we talk about computers this 
one drives me nuts. Uh, to freeze, uh, it means to stop moving. 
M: Right. 
C: Right, so, uh, well, it has a couple of different meanings. You might have heard it about 
ice before, but… 
M: Uhu. 
C: To freeze here we're talking about stopping moving, so we have a… a game 
called freeze tag. 
M: Mm. 
C: If I touch you, you have to stop running. 
M: Right. 
C: Uh, but here we’re talking about computer freezing. I’m moving my mouse and I’m 
typing and all of a sudden… 
M: It doesn’t work anymore. 
C: My… my mouse doesn’t move. I can’t close or open or do anything and it’s really 
frustrating. 
M: It’s very… especially if you’re doing something and you didn’t save your work, it’s gone. 
C: Huh-huh. 
M: Hehe. Right, so if your computer freezes, then usually you have to restart it… 
C: Yeah. 
M: Or turn it off and on. 
C: So that is, uh, about it for those words, but let’s take another listen and slow the 
dialogue down this time, so you can catch some of those big words. 
Customer: So can you fix it?
Sales Clerk: I’m sorry sir. This computer is not
broken or damaged. It’s simply
just too old! That’s why your pro-
grams and applications are run-
ning slow. There really isn’t much
I can do.
Customer: What do you mean? I bought this
computer just three years ago!
Sales Clerk: Yes, but technology is ever chang-
ing and technology is becoming
obsolete faster and faster!
Customer: Ok, I know where this is going.
How much will it cost me to get a
new computer?
Sales Clerk: Well, this desktop over here is our
latest model. It has a four gi-
gahertz processor with sixteen gi-
gabytes in RAM and a hard disk
with one terabyte. Of course, it
includes a mouse, keyboard and
desk speakers.
Customer: I have no idea what you are talk-

it’s good and if I will be able to
play solitaire without the computer
crashing or freezing all the time!
Sales Clerk: This PC is top of the line and I
guarantee it will never freeze! If
it does, we’ll give you your money
back!
C: Great, so we are back, so now let’s jump into today’s “fluency builder”. 
Voice: Fluency builder. 
M: Alright, so on fluency builder we’re gonna take a look at three different phrases. For 
example, the salesman was describing technology and sad that it’s ever-changing. 
C: Mm, okay, so this is, um, so a little poetic line here. 
M: Yeah. 
C: So, uh, ever-changing means always changing. 
M: Uhu, always. 
C: Always changing. And so we can say that the ocean is ever-changing. 
M: Hehe. 
C: You know… 
M: Hehe. Right. 
C: The waves are always changing and… 
M: Hehe. 
C: Um, but in this case he’s saying that technology is always changing, it’s always 
progressing into something new and so… 
M: Exactly. 
C: Uh, that is a key selling point for this guy. 
M: Right, so, uh, this is actually a very interesting word. We can use it like in your example 
beyond technology like the way… like the sea is ever-changing, so why don’t we listen to a 
couple of other examples? 
Voice: Example one. 
A: There’s always something new in this ever-changing world. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: Times are ever-changing and we must prepare ourselves better everyday. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: The flu is an ever-changing virus that continues to claim many lives. 
M: Alright, we’re back, so now we understand ever-changing. 
C: So the man who’s trying to buy this computer or at least get his computer fixed, really 
starts to get frustrated with the salesman and he says: “Okay I know where this is 
going”. 
M: Uhu. 
C: So he hears the sales pitch. He’s hear… he hears this guy trying toloosen him up a 
little bit, he says “I know where this is going”. So what does this mean this where 
something is going? 
M: So basically what direction a conversation or a topic or a situation is taking. 
C: Okay, so he’s saying “I know why you’re telling me these things”. 
M: Right. 
C: I know your motive. 
M: Or I know what’s happening, I know what you’re going to say. 
C: Okay, so he’s essentially saying “I know you’re going to try and sell me a computer”. 
M: Right. 
C: Alright. 
M: So, uh, you can use it in other circum… circumstances, right? For example, a 
relationship. 
C: I don’t know where this is going. 
M: Right, what… what is going? 
C: Classic break up line. 
M: Hehe. 
C: I just don’t think I know where this is going anymore. 
M: Hehe. So in reference to the relationship, right? 
C: Yeah, so… 
M: We don’t know what’s happening. Are we serious? Are we maybe gonna get married? I 
don’t know anymore. 
C: I can’t tell where this movie is going, it’s so like… ooh, let here and there 
and boring and… 
M: Yeah, you don’t know the plot. 
C: Yeah. 
M: Hehe. Alright. So it’s a very common phrase and it sounds very natural when you say it, 
right? 
C: It does. That's why in fluency builder it really helps you sound like a more native English 
speaker… 
M: Uhu. 
C: When you use this kind of phrases. 
M: And the next one is also very, very good when he describes the… the condition of the 
computer, he says it’s top of the line. 
C: Top of the line. Now, what line we’re talking about I do not know, but this is… 
M: Like above average line. 
C: Right, so this is the best of the best. This is the top model or the top computer and, uh… 
M: Uhu. 
C: You can definitely imagine a car salesman using this. 
M: Yeah. 
C: Yes, this BMW is top of the line. 
M: Hehe. 
C: The best money can buy. 
M: Yeah, that’s another good one. So, basically, top of the line is the best of the best, the… 
above average, right? 
C: More than above average. It’s really… it’s the best you can do and so… 
M: The best you can buy. 
C: The guy is saying: “Listen, this is our best computer, really, you should buy it”. And 
obviously… 
M: Usually… 
C: Top of the line. Usually it costs a lot of money. 
M: Yeah. It’s usually for… for something that costs money, right? For things. You wouldn’t 
really use it for a person, right? He is top of the line. 
C: No, no, no, no, no. 
M: Hehe. 
C: Uh, top of the line, I think generally refers to electronics and cars. 
M: Yeah. 
C: Or like motorcycles and so, you often hear top of the line stereo, top of the line TV. 
M: Uhu. 
C: Um, top of the line car. 
M: Uhu. 
C: But you wouldn’t say this about food or… 
M: Yeah. 
C: People or art. Hehe. 
M: Yeah, you wouldn’t say this… this painting is top of the line. 
C: No, no. 
M: Hehe. 
C: Not about like very unique things. 
M: Right. 
C: You’d say this about kind of manufactured things. 
M: Uhu. 
C: Uhu. 
M: Very good, so we’ve taken a look at a lot of great phrases. Why don’t we listen to our 
dialogue for the last time and then we’ll come back. 
Customer: So can you fix it?
Sales Clerk: I’m sorry sir. This computer is not
broken or damaged. It’s simply
just too old! That’s why your pro-
grams and applications are run-
ning slow. There really isn’t much
I can do.
Customer: What do you mean? I bought this
computer just three years ago!
Sales Clerk: Yes, but technology is ever chang-
ing and technology is becoming

crashing or freezing all the time!
Sales Clerk: This PC is top of the line and I
guarantee it will never freeze! If
it does, we’ll give you your money
back!
M: Alright, we are back, so, uh, computers. Catherine, I know you recently got a nice 
Macintosh. 
C: Yeah, yeah, I did. 
M: It’s one of those big screen ones, right? 
C: Yeah, it is. It’s a desktop, right… 
M: Uhu. 
C: So it’s not a laptop and, uh, it’s got a very fast processor, because Macs started using 
Intel processors… 
M: Uhu. 
C: Couple of years ago and that made them much faster. 
M: Wow, and it has… this processor actually has two cores, right? 
C: Uhu. 
M: So basically it can has two different brains almost within one processor. 
C: Which gives it really bad headaches. 
M: Hehe. 
C: She complains to me often. 
M: Are you a big, uh, Mac fan or PC fan? 
C: I’m a Mac fan. 
M: Really? 
C: I’ve been converted. My roommate in college my sophomore year had a Mac and ever 
since then I’ve really gotten into them, so… 
M: Really? 
C: Yeah, I went Mac and didn’t turn back. 
M: I’ve… I still honestly cannot really use a Mac. I get confused, I’m looking for the s… for 
the start button and I’m looking for where my documents are. 
C: It’s really hard to change over, right? 
M: Yeah. 
C: But once you do is… you don’t wanna change back, because everything is so much easier 
on a Mac. 
M: Really? 
C: But if you’re really into PC gaming, uh, then you should probablystick with it… stick 
with the PCs, because the games just don’t really compare on Macs. 
M: But I’ve heard that also Macs don’t really suffer from viruses, right? 
C: No, they don’t, which is great, cause I always used to get these viruses that would slow 
down my computer… 
M: Hehe. 
C: Cause, you know, you open some e-mail and all of a sudden… 
M: Yeah. 
C: There’s nastiness on your desktop. 
M: Hehe. 
C: Well, now I don’t really have that problem and, um, and also there’s really wonderful 
photo editing software and video editing software. 
M: Right. 
C: So everything is just really easy to find and easy to use. 
M: Mm, what about you listeners? Do you prefer the Mac? Do you prefer the PC? Or maybe 
some of our listeners don’t really even like computers. 
C: Well, let us know either way. We are very curious to hear, you have to say. And, or 
course, writing on our comments section is great practice for your English. 
M: Right, so we’ll see you guys there and until next time… 
C: Bye everyone! 
M: Bye!
