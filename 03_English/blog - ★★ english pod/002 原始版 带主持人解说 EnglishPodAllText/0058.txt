  
M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 
E: And I’m Erica. 
M: And today we have a great lesson for all our upper intermediate students. 
E: That’s right. We’re talking about airplane travel today. 
M: Airplane travel. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Right. So, we’re gonna be in an airplane, basically. 
E: Yes, and we’re gonna be listening, um, to some of the common things you might hear 
on, ah, an announcement in the airplane. 
M: Yeah, usually the flight attendant or the captain will come on and say something and, 
well, usually it’s in English, so we gotta understand what they’re saying. 
E: That’s right, and we’ll also learn some great phrases that you can use when  you wanna 
describe flights to your friends… 
M: Right. 
E: When you’re talking to them. 
M: Yeah, that always happens you arrive somewhere and people are like, hey, how was 
you flight? Now you know how to answer it, right? 
E: Exactly. 
M: Okay. So, why don’t we take a look at our “vocabulary preview”? 
Voice: Vocabulary preview. 
E: We’ve got three words for you here in vocabulary preview all about flying. 
M: Okay, so what’s our first one?  
E: Turbulence. 
M: Turbulence. 
E: Turbulence. 
M: Turbulence. 
E: So, turbulence. How can we describe this? 
M: Well, turbulence, when you’re in an airplane, basically is air that is moving in all 
directions really fast. 
E: Okay, so what happens? 
M: So, the airplane will start to shake. 
E: Okay. 
M: Right?  
E: Yep. 
M: It’s the same thing if you’re flying a kite and maybe some turbulence is in the air your 
kite will maybe fall to the ground. 
E: Ouh, ex… 
M: Yeah. So it’s… air that’s moving in all directions that’s really turbulent. 
E: Alright, well, we’ll hear how this word is used in the dialogue, um… 
M: Uhu. 
E: But another airplane word we hear a lot, um, crew. 
M: Crew. 
E: Crew. 
M: Flight crew. 
E: Yes. C-R-E-W, crew. 
M: Uhu. So, the flight crew is basically the team. 
E: Yes. 
M: Right? 
E: Yep. 
M: It’s, ah, all the people that are in the airplane. So, it’s basically the captain or in… the 
co-pilot and all the flight attendants, right? 
E: Exactly, yeah. 
M: That’s the flight crew. 
E: Yes. 
M: Okay, and what about out last word?  
E: Bumpy ride.  
M: Bumpy ride. 
E: A bumpy ride. 
M: Bumpy. 
E: Not smooth. 
M: Not smooth. 
E: Yeah. 
M: So, what would be an example of a bumpy ride? 
E: Okay, imagine if you’re driving in your car, um… 
M: Uhu. 
E: And you you’re driving on a dirt road… 
M: Uhu. 
E: Like with many holes in it and everything. 
M: And rocks and everything. 
E: Yes, you’re driving on that route and that would be really really bumpy. 
M: Right, so your car will be moving a lot. 
E: And shaking, yeah… 
M: Exactly. 
E: Yeah. So a bumpy ride is, um, a trip where you move and shake a lot, so… kind of 
uncomfortable. 
M: So you can say, that is a bumpy road. 
E: Aha. 
M: Okay. 
E: Or it was a bumpy ride. 
M: Or it was a bumpy ride. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Okay, so now let’s listen to our dialogue, we’re gonna be listening to these people on an 
airplane and the captain is gonna give some instructions. 
A: And the next thing you know, we’re running to-
wards the... Oh...did you feel that?
B: Yeah, don’t worry about it; we’re just going
through a bit of turbulence.
C: Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speak-
ing. It looks like we’ve hit a patch of rough air, so
we’re going to have a bit of a bumpy ride for the
next several minutes, and...
A: This why I hate flying... Oh!
C: At this time, I’d like to remind all of our passen-
gers to fasten their seat beltsand remain seated
until the fasten seat belt sign is turned off. Please
ensure that all cabin baggageis carefully stowed
under the seat in front of you. I’ll be back back to
update you in a minute.
A: Did you hear that? Brent!
B: Don’t worry about it. This is totally normal. It hap-
pens all the
C: Ah, ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain
again. We’ve got quite a large patch of rough air
ahead of us, so for your safety, we will be sus-
pending in-flight service. I would ask all in-flight
crew to return to their seats at this time. I would
also like to ask that all our passengers refrain from
using the lavatory until the seat belt sign has been
switched off We can expect...
 
E: Well, here we are with another dramatic dialogue, another explosion in EnglishPod. 
What’s happening? 
M: Um, I don’t know, a lot of adventure’s going on. 
E: Yeah. 
M: So, we will see what happens, um, but I’m sure they’re alright. Don’t worry everyone, 
I’m sure… 
E: Well, I hope so. It’s kind of making me nervous for my next flight. 
M: Hehe. Alright, so let’s take a look at some of the words that the captain used in 
“language takeaway”. 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
E: Alright, all of these words you’ll hear really really often when you’re flying, um, and the 
first one we have for you is fasten. 
M: Fasten. 
E: Fasten. 
M: Fasten you seatbelt. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Now, this is a great word, fasten means to… 
E: Do up. 
M: Do up or put on or… 
E: Connect. 
M: Connect, right? 
E: Yeah. 
M: So, usually it’ll be with a seatbelt or a belt or something like that. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Right? 
E: Yeah. Now, the pronunciation here is interesting. 
M: Yes. 
E: It’s spelled F-A-S-T-E-N. 
M: Right, so it would be FAST EN. 
E: No. 
M: No, right? Hehe. 
E: Fasen. 
M: Fasen. The T… 
E: Fasen. 
M: Kind of become silent. 
E: Uhu. 
M: So, it’s fasen. 
E: Yep. 
M: Okay, let’s look at our next word, lavatory. 
E: Lavatory. 
M: Lavatory. 
E: Lavatory. 
M: Okay, so what is a lavatory exactly? Cause I’m always confused what’s the difference 
between bathroom, restroom, washroom, WC, lavatory. 
E: I know, so many words for bathroom, um, a lavatory is a room with a toilet and sink 
only. 
M: Only a toilet and sink. 
E: Yes. 
M: So no bath-tub.  
E: No. 
M: So it’s… 
E: No shower either. 
M: No shower. So it’s very very common to find a lavatory in boats… 
E: Aha. 
M: Airplanes. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Or in trains. 
E: Yeah, but never in your house. 
M: Never in your house, right. 
E: Even if your room in your house is only a sink and a toilet it’s don’t let a lavatory. 
M: Yeah, it’s, ah, a bathroom. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Okay. 
E: I don’t know why, that’s just the way it is in English. 
M: And something interesting that you told me today… 
E: Aha. 
M: WC. 
E: Aha. 
M: Right? That’s a common thing that you’ll see on a bathroom. 
E: Yep. 
M: What does that stand for? 
E: Water closet. 
M: Water closet. 
E: Yep. 
M: Wow, I didn’t know that. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Water closet. Okay, anyways. Let’s take a look at our next word, stow. 
E: Stow. 
M: To stow. 
E: Yes, stow your luggage. 
M: Stow your luggage. 
E: Uhu. 
M: So if I stow my luggage it means… 
E: You put it in a place where you can get it easily, but it is very safe. 
M: Maybe it’s not even visible, right? 
E: Yeah, so you put it away in a safe spot. 
M: Okay, so usually in airplanes they will tell you to stow your luggage under your seat… 
E: Yes, or stow your luggage in the overhead bin. 
M: Overhead bin or overhead compartment.  
E: Yes. 
M: Okay, and our last word. 
E: Refrain. 
M: Refrain. 
E: Refrain. 
M: Refrain from doing something. 
E: Uhu, so this is a verb, um, meaning avoid doing. 
M: Avoid doing. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Do not do. 
E: Exactly. 
M: Something interesting about this grammar wise is… it’s usually followed by from. 
E: Yep. 
M: Refrain from, and the verb that follows is always gerund, right? 
E: Yeah, so refrain from –ing. 
M: Right, refrain from using the lavatory. 
E: Yes, refrain from smoking. 
M: Refrain from smoking, okay. 
E: Uhu. 
M: So, refrain from. 
E: Yep. 
M: Alright, so some really great examples in language takeaway. 
E: Yep. 
M: And, ah, well, now let’s take a look at “fluency builder” and see some of these great 
phrases. 
Voice: Fluency builder. 
E: Alright, three phrases we have for you here, um, the first one, remain seated. 
M: Remain seated. 
E: Remain seated. 
M: Remain seated. So, to remain seated. 
E: Really simple, to stay sitting. 
M: To stay on your seat, don’t stand up. 
E: Yes. 
M: This is really important in airplanes, right? 
E: Yeah, because otherwise if there’s turbulence you could, you know, end up flying around 
the airplane. 
M: Hehe. Or fall, exactly… 
E: Yeah. 
M: And hurt yourself. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Remain seated. 
E: Now, one of the reasons they had to remain seated was because they were going to go 
through a patch of rough air. 
M: Patch of rough air. 
E: Uhu, so patch. 
M: No, interesting, okay, so patch is a small area, right? 
E: Yeah, yeah, so a small are of turbulence. 
M: A small area of turbulence, now… 
E: Yeah. 
M: What would be another example of patch? 
E: Um, maybe, ah, patch of strawberries. 
M: So, it’s like a little strawberry garden, right? 
E: Yes, or a patch of grass. 
M: Patch of grass. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Usually in front of your house you have a little patch of grass. 
E: Yep. 
M: Okay, so patch of and now our last phrase, suspend. 
E: Suspend. 
M: Suspend in flight service. 
E: Yeah, so stop for a short time. 
M: Stop for a short time. So you could suspend your work. 
E: Yeah, and if you’re going on vacation you could suspend your subscription to the 
newspaper. 
M: Uhu. Okay, so suspend, to temporarily stop. 
E: Yes. 
M: Okay, so we’ve covered a lot of vocabulary and some great phases. 
E: Uhu. 
M: So, why don’t we listen to our dialogue one more time and we’ll come back and talk 
about flying. 
A: And the next thing you know, we’re running to-
wards the... Oh...did you feel that?
B: Yeah, don’t worry about it; we’re just going
through a bit of turbulence.
C: Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speak-
ing. It looks like we’ve hit a patch of rough air, so
we’re going to have a bit of a bumpy ride for the
next several minutes, and...
A: This why I hate flying... Oh!

crew to return to their seats at this time. I would
also like to ask that all our passengers refrain from

M: Erica, have you ever had a turbulent flight like this? 
E: No… no never this bad, a little bit of turbulence, actually I kind of like turbulent flights. 
M: Why? 
E: It’s sort of like… I don’t know it’s kind of fun, you get shaken around, you… like stomach 
moves up and down and it’s like… 
M: You don’t get nervous? 
E: No, I get… I get a little excited. 
M: Well, it is true that flying is actually very very safe, right? 
E: Yeah, um, I know we all hear that like more people are killed in car accidents, than, ah, 
flight accidents. 
M: Uhu. 
E: So, it’s very very safe. So, yeah, I don’t worry about the turbulence. 
M: Yeah, yeah. 
E: Knock on wood. [NOTE: knock on wood is an idiom that means to avoid something 
bad happening or to continue something good happening; it is usually said while actually 
knocking on something made of wood] 
M: Hehe. Yeah, so flying is really safe and, you know, as long as you… remain seated, you 
fasten you seatbelt and you, you know, you follow the instructions you shouldn’t have any 
problems, right? 
E: Yeah, yeah, actually that’s a really good point cause actually when I was reading about 
flight turbulence for this dialogue… 
M: Uhu. 
E: I kept reading all these stories about these people who, you know, when they got into 
some turbulent air were, you know, knocked over or they ended up like actually literally 
flying through the cabin and getting really badly hurt, so… 
M: Yeah, yeah. 
E: Everyone, you gotta fasten you seatbelt. 
M: Yes, remain seated. 
E: Yeah, flying tips here at EnglishPod. 
M: Flying tips at EnglishPod, we don’t want you to get hurt and we know that you travel a 
lot, so be safe, right?
