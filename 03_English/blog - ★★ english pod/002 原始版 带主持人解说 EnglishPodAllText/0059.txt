M: Exactly, you asked for a lesson about job interviews and well, here we are, we’re 
bringing you the first of three parts of the job interview series. 
E: Alright, so, Marco, you said it is the first of three parts, um… 
M: Right. 
E: So, tell me what are these three parts?   
M: Okay, in this lesson we’re gonna be looking at preparing for a job interview. 
E: Okay. 
M: So, everything you gotta do before the job interview. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Part two will be talking about your education, your background, your work experience. 
E: Okay. 
M: And in part three we’ll take a look at some of the common questions that are asked at a 
job interview. 
E: And so we’ll talk about some great ways to answer these questions. 
M: Exactly. 
E: Alright, these three lessons will be conning out over the next month or so. 
M: Exactly, so we’re gonna be looking at part one today, so let’s take a look at some 
vocabulary preview. 
Voice: Vocabulary preview. 
E: We have three words here in vocabulary preview, that you’ll hear in the dialogue in a 
moment. And the first one is, actually, not really a word, but an acronym. 
M: Right, CRM. 
E: CRM. 
M: CRM. 
E: So, Marco, you are our marketing guy, tell us, what is a CRM? 
M: Well, it’s really common in marketing. 
E: Uhu. 
M: It stands for customer relationship management. 
E: Okay. 
M: Or customer relation management, what basically it’s the relationship that the company 
has with its customers.  
E: Okay. 
M: So, CRM basically has parts like feedback or customer support, ah, problems that 
they might have and also information about habits and likes and dislikes from their 
customers or users. 
E: Okay, but I… I… I commonly hear this word, ah, used as a noun, so something like, can 
you check in the CRM. 
M: Right, there’s some software out there, that… that’s called the CRM, so… 
E: Uhu. 
M: Sugar CRM or many different softwares, which basically manages your database of 
customers, basically software that… that englobes this whole thing. 
E: Okay, got it, right, our next phrase in vocabulary preview, custom designed.  
M: Custom designed. 
E: Custom designed. 
M: Custom designed. 
E: So, when something is custom designed… 
M: It means it’s a special design just for you. 
E: So, it’s unique. 
M: Right, that’s would the word custom means. 
E: Unique, like made especially for one person. 
M: Right. So you have custom designed or also custom made. 
E: Uhu. 
M: You see it a lot, for example, in cars, right? A custom made car. 
E: Yes, or maybe a custom built house. 
M: A custom built house. 
E: Yep. 
M: With your specific likes and dislikes, ??? 
E: Yeah, your requirements, yep. 
M: Uhu. Okay, and our last word, core values. 
E: Core values. 
M: Core values. 
E: Core values. 
M: So, the core values of a company… what a… what does the core mean, actually? 
E: The center. 
M: The center, right? 
E: Yep. So, and here I think it’s like the center or the most important. 
M: The most important things that company believes in, right? 
E: Right, so maybe, ah, respect for the environment. 
M: Okay, or developing their employees. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Okay, so the core values… 
E: Yep. 
M: Main things that the company believes in. 
E: A great phrase for job interviews. 
M: Oh yes, very good phrase. Okay, so why don’t we listen to our dialogue? Erica, what 
exactly is happening? 
E: Alright, we’re… we’re gonna be listening to two friends, um, and this guy is getting ready 
to go on a job interview, so his friend is helping him to prepare. 
M: Okay. 
A: Okay, so let’s go over everything one more time. I
really want you to get this job!
B: I know! It’s an amazing growth opportunity!
They’re true industry leaders, and it would be so
interesting to be part of an organization that is the
undisputed leader in business process platform
development.
A: So, let’s see, you did your research on the com-
pany, right?
B: Well, I visited their website and read up on what
they do. They’re an IT service company that of-
fers comprehensive business solutions for large
corporations. They provide services such as
CRM development, and they also offer custom-
designed applications.
A: So what would your role in the company?
B: Well, the position is for an account manager. That
basically means that I would be the link between
our and our development team.
A: Sounds good, and so, why do you want to work
with them?
B: Well, as I said they’re the industry leaders, they
have a really great growth strategy, amazing de-
velopment opportunities for employees, and it
seems like they have strong corporate gover-
nance. They’re all about helping companies grow
and unleashing potential. I guess their core val-
ues and mission really resonated with me. Oh,
and they offer six weeks’ vacation, stock options
and bonuses... I’m totally going to cash in on that.
A: You idiot! Don’t say that! Do you want this job, or
not?
 
M: Alright, so he was doing great, but… in the end he said something he shouldn’t, right? 
E: Yeah, I don’t think talking about money as your primary motivation for a coming on to 
new company is… 
M: Yeah, exactly. 
E: Really the way to go. 
M: Yeah, and we’re gonna talk about that a little bit later, but let’s take a look real quick at 
some language takeaway. 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
E: Alright, in this lesson we have five key words for you from the dialogue, um, which, we 
hope, that you will remember. 
M: Uhu. Let’s take a look at the first one, undisputed. 
E: Undisputed. 
M: Undisputed. 
E: Undisputed. 
M: So, this is kind of a strange word, let’s listen to some examples before we explain it. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: It’s undisputed, that she’s the best person for the job. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: The undisputed truth is that unemployment is rising, no one doubts that. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: He’s the undisputed champion of the world. 
E: Well, can I understand from these examples that it means, um, there’s no doubt.  
M: There’s no doubt, exactly. 
E: There’s no question. 
M: Okay, now let’s take a look our second word, growth opportunity. 
E: Growth opportunity. 
M: It’s a great growth opportunity. 
E: Uhu, so it’s an excellent chance to improve, right? 
M: To improve, professionally and also on a personal side, right? 
E: Yeah, so talking about growth opportunities we can also use the phrase a development 
opportunity. 
M: Uhu, And it’s the same thing, right? 
E: Yep. 
M: To develop, to grow. 
E: To improve yourself. 
M: Okay, now let’s take a look at our third word, read up. 
E: Read up. 
M: Read up. 
E: Read up. 
M: So when you read up on something… 
E: Well, obviously you read it, right? 
M: Right. 
E: But you’re reading it specifically for some information, so you can know more about the 
subject. 
M: So, it’s kind of similar to study, right? 
E: Kind of, but really what the idea that you’re trying to… improve your knowledge about a 
particular field. 
M: Okay, now for our forth word, unleash potential. 
E: Unleash potential. 
M: Unleash potential. 
E: Unleash potential. 
M: Okay, so to unleash. 
E: Alright, well, I’m gonna paint a picture for you. 
M: Alright. 
E: Um, so imagine you have your dog, right? 
M: Uhu. 
E: And your dog is walking on a leash, like it has a string or rope attached to it. 
M: Right. 
E: So then when you undo the leash, you unleash the dog and then what happens? 
M: It goes around and it’s running and… 
E: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it’s going everywhere. 
M: Aha. 
E: So, if you unleash potential, you release it and let it go and help it…  
M: Grow and become bigger. 
E: Yes, yeah, exactly. 
M: So you give it freedom. 
E: Aha. 
M: So, potential is the capabilities or abilities that the person has, right?  
E: Yes. 
M: To do something great. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Okay, unleash potential. 
E: This, I think, is an excellent word to use in a job interview. I think it is really descriptive 
and really powerful. 
M: Yeah, it is. 
E: Yeah. 
M: That’s a good word. Ah, okay, so let’s take a look at our last one now, resonate with. 
E: Resonate with. 
M: Resonate with. 
E: Resonate with. 
M: So, he mentioned, this really resonated with me, so what does he mean by 
resonated? 
E: I guess, he means it connected to him, right? 
M: Uhu. 
E: It touched him. 
M: So, he agrees with this idea or he feels that he can relate to it. 
E: Yeah, exactly, you know what, I think this one needs a few examples to really show its 
meaning. 
M: Okay, let’s listen. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: The candidate speech really resonated with the voters. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: Their music doesn’t really resonate with me. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: Your commitment to fight global warming resonates with me. 
M: Alright, so it’s clear now to resonate with. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Right? Okay, so why don’t we go and listen to our dialogue for the last time and then 
we’ll come back and give you some great pointers about preparing for a job interview. 
A: Okay, so let’s go over everything one more time. I
really want you to get this job!
B: I know! It’s an amazing growth opportunity!
They’re true industry leaders, and it would be so
interesting to be part of an organization that is the
undisputed leader in business process platform
development.

ues and mission really resonated with me. Oh,
and they offer six weeks’ vacation, stock options
and bonuses... I’m totally going to cash in on that.
A: You idiot! Don’t say that! Do you want this job, or
not?
 
M: Okay, so, preparing for a job interview is really important, right? 
E: Yes, yep. 
M: Um, and we’re gonna give you some really basic tips about how you can prepare for a 
job interview. 
E: Yep, I gotta confess something to you, Marco. 
M: What? 
E: I love job interviews. 
M: Really? 
E: Yeah. I know it’s really weird, most people hate them, but I love them. 
M: So you love being the interviewer or going to job interviews. 
E: Both. 
M: Really? 
E: Yeah, I… 
M: Ouh. 
E: I like everything about them, so I feel like I have a lot of passion to share with you about 
this. 
M: Hehe. Alright, so let’s take a look at the first, ah… point or the first tip, that you can help 
us out with. So, before you go to a job interview, you should do a little bit of research, 
right? 
E: Right, and that’s our first point, um, it’s really important to know as much as you can 
about the company, their history, their product, their… management style… just as much 
information as you can find out about how they work… and what they do. 
M: Aha, and why do you think this is important? 
E: Well, basically, um, you’ll be asked about it in the interview. 
M: Right. 
E: And, so if you show that you haven’t prepared, you haven’t done any research, you show 
that you don’t care. 
M: One of the best ways that you can impress in the job interview is to show that you know 
about the company and… 
E: Uhu. 
M: Important things like you know what kind of products they offer or what’s their largest 
market. 
E: Yeah. 
M: And I guess, that really impresses the interviewer… 
E: Yeah. 
M: Because it shows that you’re interested in this company and that you’re really want the 
job. 
E: And that you’re willing to do the extra work it takes to prepare yourself. 
M: Uhu. 
E: Cause I think that’ll show the interviewer that later on, when you’re working for them 
you’ll do that extra work on the job. 
M: Exactly, that’s a really good point. So, that’s our first point, our first tip, to do some 
research.  
E: Yes. 
M: Now, you’ve done your research, you know everything about the company, what else 
should you do? 
E: Once you’ve read up on the company, you’ve gotta spent some time thinking about 
yourself.  
M: Uhu. 
E: You’ve gotta prepare to sell yourself to the company. 
M: Okay. So to sell yourself, to really demonstrate them why you’re the perfect person for 
the job. 
E: Right, because a lot of people think about why they want to work for the company, right? 
M: Uhu. 
E: Because they feel like they’re aligned with the core values or, um, the message of the 
company resonates with them. 
M: Uhu. 
E: But what the interviewer really wants to hear is how you, the interviewee, is going to 
benefit the company, what’re you gonna bring to the company? 
M: Right, and this is the most important part is to know what are your skills, right? 
E: Yes. 
M: And, it’s not enough to just say, well, I’m a great leader. 
E: Yep. 
M: Right? So, if you are a great leader, you should be ready to give an example of how you 
have demonstrated to be a great leader, right? 
E: Yes, alright, so maybe like an example like I’m a really strong leader because in my 
previous job I’d the best JDpower ratings for employees’ satisfaction.  
M: Uhu, okay, so you’re actually showing with numbers… 
E: Yes. 
M: Or with facts, that you are a great leader. 
E: Yeah, so, the… the key thing here, I think, is identify what your strength and skills are, 
think of specific examples, if you can give numbers and show how you can bring this skill, 
um, and your… your experiences to the new company. 
M: And now, well, you’re ready to sell yourself, you've done your research, now you have all 
of these things in your mind. 
E: Uhu. 
M: You have to practice. 
E: Yes. 
M: Right? 
E: A m… A much overlooked stage in the preparation. 
M: Yeah, a… a lot of people think it through they… they write things down, but don’t really 
practice.  
E: Yeah, so I know you have a few tips about how you can practice interviewing effectively. 
M: Uhu, okay, well, the first thing that you should do is… use your friends. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Right? 
E: They gotta be good for something. 
M: Exactly, and, well, probably your friends are also working at a company… 
E: Yeah. 
M: Maybe they’re managers or maybe they’ve interviewed someone before already, so you 
can set up a mini interview and have them pretend that they’re the interviewer. 
E: Uhu. 
M: And ask you these questions and you try to answer seriously and I’m sure, that your 
friends can give you some great feedback, maybe… 
E: Yeah. 
M: What you did right, maybe what you did wrong, um, so, that’s a really good way. And 
another thing is also you can record yourself. 
E: Yes. 
M: Right? 
E: Yeah, um, if you have a video camera or even a web, I mean many people have a 
webcam like right in you laptop. 
M: Uhu. 
E: Um, record yourself actually doing the practice interview with your friend. 
M: And this is really useful, because you can later see what you recorded… 
E: Uhu. 
M: And detect some of the things that maybe aren’t really useful or good, you know, for 
example, posture is a really important aspect. 
E: So, what do mean, posture? 
M: So, the way that you you’re sitting down in your seat… 
E: Yep. 
M: And how you’re expressing yourself with your hands… 
E: Yep. 
M: Some people, you know, they move a lot… 
E: Uhu. 
M: During the in… because, of course, you’re nervous, so… 
E: Yeah. 
M: Maybe they’re moving from side to side or playing with their feet or playing with 
something on the table or moving their… hands in an awkward way, so those are the things 
that you have to watch out for. 
E: Yes. So, it… I guess, it’s really important to sit up straight and to show that you are 
powerful in… in control. 
M: And another really great thing is eye-contact, right? 
E: Yeah, yeah, we were talking about this earlier. 
M: Uhu, and eye… why is eye-contact so important? 
E: If an interviewee maintains eye-contact with me for like most of the interview, I feel like 
they have really good people skills.  
M: Uhu. In my opinion I would say they have a lot of self-confidence. 
E: Yeah, I’d agree. 
M: Right? 
E: Yeah. 
M: Because if a person is looking down or not looking directly at you, it’s either of two 
things, in my opinion… 
E: Uhu. 
M: It’s either they’re not confident enough with themselves or they’re lying to you.  
E: Yes. 
M: Right? 
E: Yeah. 
M: So… 
E: Or… or also they… just they don’t have good people skills. 
M: Yeah. 
E: Yeah, which is a problem in… in today's sort of knowledge-based economy. 
M: Exactly. 
E: Uhu. 
M: So, it’s really important to maintain eye-contact and one other really important thing 
related to eye-contact posture…    
E: Yeah. 
M: Is the handshake.  
E: Uhu. 
M: When you get to the interview it’s really really important to give a firm good handshake. 
E: So, what qualifies as a firm good handshake? 
M: Well, you don’t have to prove that you are ultra strong, right? So, you don’t have to 
squeeze the other person’s hand really hard. 
E: And like break their hand. 
M: Exactly. 
E: Yeah. 
M: It’s not like a… strength contest. 
E: No. 
M: A good firm handshake is squeezing normally, not too tight, not too loose… 
E: Yeah. 
M: But your entire palm, your entire hand has to be in contact with the other person’s palm 
or hand. 
E: Yes. 
M: Don’t give them the fingers, you know, like… 
E: Yeah. 
M: Some people give you only four fingers or a half of their hand. 
E: Yeah, I hate that. 
M: I hate that too and this goes for men and for women… 
E: Yeah. 
M: Because a lot of women do this. 
E: Yep, I call this the 'dead fish' handshake. 
M: The dead… hehe. It is kind of like a dead fish of the dead hand handshake. 
E: Yeah, yeah, I’d… I absolutely agree with you on this one, so, nice firm handshake. 
M: Yeah, firm handshake and, well, these are our tips for preparing for the interview and 
everything you have to do before it. I’m sure there’re a lot more things out there. 
E: Uhu. 
M: So, and I’m sure our users have some insight on this as well. 
E: Yeah, I’d love to hear it, cause like I told you I love job interviews.
