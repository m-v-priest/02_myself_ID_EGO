M: Hello everyone! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 
E: And I'm Erica. 
M: And today we're bringing you the second part of Christmas Chronicles. 
E: Another Christmas lesson to get you in the Christmas spirit. 
M: Hehe. Christmas and useful language for all our listeners today. 
E: That's right, in today's lesson we'll be learning some great Christmas vocabulary. 
M: And police related vocabulary as well. 
E: Now, Christmas-police vocabulary, how exactly does that fit together? 
M: Hehe. Well, they don't. 
E: Hehe. 
M: But here at EnglishPod we can make anything happen, so, that's why we have done this. 
E: To be creative. 
M: To be creative. So, let's take a look at our “vocabulary preview” for this lesson. 
Voice: Vocabulary preview. 
E: In today's vocabulary preview we've got two words from our dialogue that you will need to 
know to understand this dialogue. 
M: Uhu, the first one is elves. 
E: Elves. 
M: Elves. 
E: Elves, and this is the plural of the word elf. 
M: Elf, right. 
E: So, elves are… 
M: Little people. Hehe. 
E: Little people with pointy hats. 
M: With pointy hats; Santa's helpers. 
E: Okay, so, elves. 
M: Elves. 
E: Our next word is candy cane. 
M: Candy cane. 
E: Candy cane. 
M: Candy cane. 
E: So, a candy cane is a traditional Christmas candy, right? 
M: Yes, it's red and white. 
E: And it's kind of shaped like a… like a 'J'. 
M: Like a 'J', yeah. 
E: Okay, so, it… 
M: It's very traditional. 
E: Yeah, you… you hang them on a tree and you eat them at Christmas time. 
M: Yes. 
E: Taste like peppermint. 
M: Okay, well, I guess we're ready to listen to our dialogue for the first time, uh, and it's gonna 
be kind of fast, but… 
E: Don't worry if you don't understand everything, because we'll come back and talk about 
some of the language later. 
A: Really, gentlemen, you can’t take me to jail! Don’t
you know who I am? Kris Kringle, you know, Papa
Noel, Pere Noel, Babbo Natale, sheng dan lao
ren!
B: Yeah, Yeah, we’ve heard that one before, haven’t
we Joe?
C: Yeah, last week we booked this guy who claimed
to be the tooth fairy! Can you believe that?
A: It’s Christmas Eve and I have all these presents to
deliver! Where is your Christmas spirit? What will
happen when all the children wake up tomorrow
and don’t find any gifts in their stockings?
B: Sorry buddy, you were parked in a no-parking
zone, you were speeding, and you have no ID!
C: Besides that, even if we let you go now, your
sleigh has been impounded and those reindeer
were taken to the city zoo.
A: What! This is unbelievable! What’s this world
coming to? Christmas is ruined!
C: What’s that up ahead? It looks like... elves!!
Elves!! Whoa, they’re shooting candy canes!
Mayday, Mayday, we are under heavy attack! We
need backup!
M: Okay, so, Santa has escaped from the police car, hey? 
E: Thank God! 
M: It's like a war over there. They were really firing everything. 
E: I know, I mean those elves are… 
M: Aggressive. 
E: Very aggressive. 
M: Hehe. Okay, well, we can take a look at some great vocabulary from this dialogue. Why 
don't we start with our “language takeaway” for today? 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
E: In today's language takeaway we have five really important words that we hope you will take 
away from the lesson. 
M: Exactly, and the first word that we have today is booked. 
E: Booked. 
M: Booked. 
E: Booked. 
M: Booked is another way of saying… 
E: Arrested. 
M: Arrested. 
E: Yeah, it's a slang word, hey? 
M: It's kind of slangy, yeah. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Yeah, it's a slang word – booked. 
E: Okay, next word – speeding. 
M: Speeding. 
E: Speeding. 
M: Speeding. 
E: So, Santa was speeding, because he was… 
M: Going too fast. 
E: Driving too fast, yeah. 
M: Right… 
E: Okay. 
M: Going over the speed limit. 
E: Exactly. 
M: Uhu. 
E: Third word today is… 
M: Impounded. 
E: Impounded. 
M: Impounded… 
E: Hm. 
M: That's when your car gets arrested. 
E: Your car gets arrested? 
M: Hehe. Yeah, they take your car to 'car jail'. 
E: Okay, so, my car is in 'car jail'. 
M: It's… 
E: I think I understand. 
M: It's impounded. 
E: Okay, so, the police take my car and I have to… 
M: Pay to get it out. 
E: Okay. 
M: Uhu. 
E: Let's move to our next word – ruined. 
M: Ruined. 
E: Ruined. 
M: Ruined. 
E: We have a few examples for us to listen to, to understand the meaning of this word. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: It’s been raining for five days. Our vacation is ruined. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: Look at this hole! You’ve ruined my favorite pair of jeans. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: Sam, you’ve been caught steeling from the company, your chances for a promotion are 
ruined. 
M: Okay, great examples and basically ruined means… 
E: Destroyed. 
M: Destroyed. 
E: Yeah, messed up. 
M: Messed up, okay. Now for our last word – back up. Backup. 
E: Oh, yeah… 
M: So, now for our last word… Okay, so, now for our last word on language takeaway – backup. 
E: Backup. 
M: Backup. 
E: Backup. 
M: So, backup is… 
E: Help. 
M: Help. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Right? 
E: So, when you call for backup, you call for help. 
M: Call for help. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Yeah, you see it all the time in war movies, police “Call for backup!” 
E: Yeah. 
M: Right? 
E: I think though it's important to point out that here the pronunciation and stress of this phrase 
is really important, hey? 
M: Uhu, yes, yes. 
E: You have to say backup. 
M: Backup. 
E: Backup. 
M: Yeah. 
E: So, both words are stressed at about the same level, hey? 
M: Uhu, backup. 
E: Cause if you were to say back up… 
M: That means to move back. 
E: Exactly. 
M: Yeah, it's different, so, backup, back up. 
E: Yes. 
M: Uhu. 
E: The stress is important. 
M: The stress ??? 
E: Alright, well, you know what? I think with those words in mind it's time for us to listen to the 
dialogue a second time. 
A: Really, gentlemen, you can’t take me to jail! Don’t
you know who I am? Kris Kringle, you know, Papa
Noel, Pere Noel, Babbo Natale, sheng dan lao
ren!
B: Yeah, Yeah, we’ve heard that one before, haven’t
we Joe?
C: Yeah, last week we booked this guy who claimed
to be the tooth fairy! Can you believe that?
A: It’s Christmas Eve and I have all these presents to
deliver! Where is your Christmas spirit? What will
happen when all the children wake up tomorrow
and don’t find any gifts in their stockings?
B: Sorry buddy, you were parked in a no-parking
zone, you were speeding, and you have no ID!
C: Besides that, even if we let you go now, your
sleigh has been impounded and those reindeer
were taken to the city zoo.
A: What! This is unbelievable! What’s this world
coming to? Christmas is ruined!
C: What’s that up ahead? It looks like... elves!!
Elves!! Whoa, they’re shooting candy canes!
Mayday, Mayday, we are under heavy attack! We
need backup!
M: Okay, so, without the sound effects and without any noise I think it's much more clear now, 
right? 
E: A little less dramatic. 
M: Less dramatic, but good language. 
E: Yes, speaking of good language, there're some great phrases I wanna look at in this dialogue 
and, so, let's do that in “putting it together”. 
Voice: Putting it together. 
E: We have two phrases in putting it together that we want to show you how you can use in 
many different situations. In the dialogue we heard this… 
Phrase: Last week we booked this guy who claimed to be the tooth fairy. Last week we booked 
this guy who claimed to be the tooth fairy. 
E: So, when you claim to be something, you're saying that you are something, but it might not be 
true, right? 
M: Right, so, for example, you can say “This woman claimed to be your wife”. 
E: But she's not. 
M: Bu she's not. 
E: Okay, we have a few other examples of how you can use the phrase claim to. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: Daniel claimed to be the son of a Government Minister, but later we found out that he was 
lying. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: The criminals claimed to have a gun! 
Voice: Example three. 
C: This man here, he’s claiming to know your father. 
E: That's such a great phrase, just by putting it together with another verb means something 
different, but still expresses that same idea. 
M: Right, claim to have… She claimed to have a baby or something. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Okay. 
E: Okay, so, let's move to our next phrase… 
M: Under heavy. 
E: Under heavy. 
M: Under heavy. 
E: So, in the dialogue they said “we're under heavy attack”. 
M: Right. 
E: You can also use this phrase in a couple of other ways. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: We’re under heavy attack! 
Voice: Example two. 
B: We’re under heavy fire! 
Voice: Example three. 
C: The Prime Minister is under heavy security. 
E: So, if you're under heavy fire… 
M: Means that there's a lot of fire. 
E: Like gun fire. 
M: Gun fire, yeah. 
E: Yean, and not like fire fire. 
M: Yeah. 
E: Okay, and if you're under heavy security… 
M: It means that you have a lot of security, a lot of bodyguards or a lot of… 
E: Right, like a Prime Minister, a President would be under heavy security. 
M: Exactly. 
E: Okay. 
M: Uhu. 
E: Couple of great phrases. 
M: Really good phrases and with this we can listen to our dialogue a third time. 
A: Really, gentlemen, you can’t take me to jail! Don’t
you know who I am? Kris Kringle, you know, Papa
Noel, Pere Noel, Babbo Natale, sheng dan lao
ren!
B: Yeah, Yeah, we’ve heard that one before, haven’t
we Joe?
C: Yeah, last week we booked this guy who claimed
to be the tooth fairy! Can you believe that?
A: It’s Christmas Eve and I have all these presents to
deliver! Where is your Christmas spirit? What will
happen when all the children wake up tomorrow
and don’t find any gifts in their stockings?
B: Sorry buddy, you were parked in a no-parking
zone, you were speeding, and you have no ID!
C: Besides that, even if we let you go now, your
sleigh has been impounded and those reindeer
were taken to the city zoo.
A: What! This is unbelievable! What’s this world
coming to? Christmas is ruined!
C: What’s that up ahead? It looks like... elves!!
Elves!! Whoa, they’re shooting candy canes!
Mayday, Mayday, we are under heavy attack! We
need backup!
E: So, Marco, the police mentioned something about the Tooth Fairy. 
M: The Tooth Fairy. 
E: I don't know, maybe some of our listeners don't know the story about the Tooth Fairy, so, 
um… Can I go ahead and say it? 
M: Yes, go ahead. 
E: Okay, well, when you're small and you lose a tooth. 
M: Your baby teeth. 
E: Yeah, you put it underneath your pillow. 
M: Aha. 
E: And then you go to sleep. 
M: Uhu. 
E: And then in the night the Tooth Fairy comes into the house… flies into the house, snicks 
under your pillow, takes the tooth and puts money there. 
M: Uh, I see.  
E: So, this is the story that parents tell their kids about what happens to their baby teeth. 
M: And they get money in exchange for it. 
E: Right, so, I guess it takes away the sadness of losing that tooth. 
M: Yeah, yeah. But in South America, for example, we have the tooth mouse. 
E: The tooth mouse. 
M: Yes… 
E: Okay. 
M: The tooth mouse. 
E: What… what is… how is it called in… in Spanish? 
M: Oh, well, some… in some places it's called Ratoncito Pérez. 
E: Aha. 
M: Like, it has a last name Pérez. 
E: Oh, really? 
M: Uh, in other places it's just called Ratoncito, Raton, which means mouse. 
E: Okay, so, it would be like Tooth Fairy Smith. 
M: To… yeah, Tooth Fairy Smith. And it's the same thing, it's a little mouse, it comes in and 
steels the little tooth from you and leaves money in exchange. 
E: Cool! Very cool! 
M: Yeah, yeah. 
E: So, we go from Santa Clause, uh, to guns and wars, to the Tooth Fairy. 
M: Only at EnglishPod. 
E: Exactly. 
M: Hehe.
