M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name isMarco. 
E: And I’m Erica. 
M: And today we are going back in time again and this time we’re gonna be in the nineteen 
sixties (1960’s). 
E: That’s right! We’re going to learn some, uh, phrases and some slang that were really 
popular back in nineteen sixty four… 
M: Exactly! And most of these phrases and words we still use today, so, it’s very interesting 
and very good to know. 
E: That’s right! I’m looking forward to, uh, this trip back in time, so, why don’t we get 
started with the dialogue? 
A: Hey man... I really like your pad. Those lava
lamps are far out! Thanks for letting me crash
here tonight.
B: It’s no problem, brother! I wanted a pad where
people could come, listen to music and just hang
loose, you dig what I’m saying?
A: I dig it man! We could throw a bash here and
make it a really happening scene!
B: Yeah man, that would be groovy! Hey, I gotta split
for a while, are you OK here by yourself?
A: Don’t worry about me brother... You go take care
of business.
B: Alright, peace out.
M: Alright, so, great dialogue - very popular in the sixties - the music, the mood… 
E: Uhu. 
M: And the words, right? 
E: That’s right! 
M: So, why don’t we get down to business and look at the vocabulary that we saw in this 
dialogue in “language takeaway”? 
Voice: Language takeaway. 
E: Well, the dialogue opened and we heard this guy say “hey man, I really like your pad”. 
M: I really like your pad. 
E: Pad. 
M: Okay, so, pad – a very informal way of saying… 
E: Your apartment. 
M: Your apartment, right? 
E: Uhu. 
M: And now, it’s… you can still use it today. 
E: Yeah, that’s right, we often hear the expression bachelor pad. 
M: Okay, a bachelor pad. 
E: So, that’s an apartment where a single man lives. 
M: Okay, so, a bachelor pad. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Usually, it’s very nicely decorated and really… a nice apartment, right? 
E: Or maybe it has empty pizza boxes all over the floor, Marco. 
M: Also a bachelor pad. 
E: Yeah. 
M: But, so, that’s what pad means – an apartment. 
E: Yeah. 
M: They were talking about the apartment and he said “the lava lamps are far out”. 
E: Far out. 
M: Okay, it’s far out. 
E: So, that’s really cool or amazing. 
M: Right, and now, lava lamps, those are those, ah, strange calm-looking lamps, right? 
E: Kind of a light with like some liquid moving inside it. 
M: Moving inside. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Very popular in the sixties. 
E: Yeah. 
M: So… 
E: We’ll post some pictures of that. 
M: Yeah, and the lamps are far out, so, now you can use that with other things, right? Like 
you are really far out. 
E: Yeah, or this music is really far out. 
M: Okay. 
E: It kind of gives you the feeling like it sort of spacey. 
M: Hehe. Spacey. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Alright, so, the pad is really far out, the lava lamps are great and he was saying “Thanks 
for letting me crash here tonight”. 
E: To crash. 
M: So, to crash at, uh, someone’s place. 
E: Right, so, we’re not talking about like a car crash here. 
M: No, no, no. 
E: But, so, when you crash somewhere, what do you do? 
M: Well, you are staying there, then… you’re gonna stay there. 
E: So, you’re guest… 
M: As a guest. 
E: Yeah, so, like sleep, right? 
M: Aha. 
E: Yep, and for free. 
M: For free, yes. 
E: Yes. 
M: So, if, for example, you’re going to New York and you’re gonna visit a friend, you might 
crash at your friend’s house. 
E: That’s right, so, interesting word, um, and it is quite commonly used now. So, why don’t 
we hear some examples of how we can use it? 
Voice: Example one. 
A: Hey man, can I crash at your place tonight? 
Voice: Example two. 
B: I lost my keys, so, I’m crashing at my girlfriend’s house. 
Voice: Example three. 
C: No, you’ve been sleeping on my coach for a month, you're not gonna crash here tonight! 
M: Alright, perfect, so, to crash, right? It’s still commonly used today. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Now, for the forth word – groovy. 
E: Groovy. 
M: That would be groovy. 
E: So, again, this means like great or cool or really nice. 
M: Yeah, this is… I think this is one of the main words of the nineteen sixties. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Something was groovy. 
E: Yes, I agree, so, it kind of gives you the sense that it’s sort of really cool, but in a relaxed 
way. 
M: Yeah, it’s groovy. 
E: Uhu. 
M: This music is really groovy. 
E: That’s right! 
M: And finally, his friend, he said “hey, I gotta split for a while”. 
E: To split. 
M: Okay, so, if I say “I have to split”. 
E: You have to leave. 
M: I have to leave. 
E: Yeah. 
M: Very colloquial. 
E: Uhu. 
M: And it means I have to leave for a little bit. 
E: Yep. 
M: Split for a while. 
E: That’s right! You may not have heard this one before, so, why don’t we hear some 
examples to help you understand how it’s used? 
Voice: Example one. 
A: Hurry up! We’ve gotta split before the police get here. 
Voice: Example two. 
B: This party is boring; let’s split! 
Voice: Example three. 
C: I have to wake up early tomorrow, so, we’re going to split. 
M: Okay, very good, so, split. Now also, I think you can use it for relationships, right? Me 
and him… 
E: Oh, yeah! 
M: Me and her… 
E: Yeah. 
M: Me and her split up. [NOTE: This is what was said, but it isn't correct English; one could 
say "we split up" or "she and I split up"] 
E: That’s right, so, you ended your relationship. 
M: Yeah, split. Okay, so, we s… we saw five, ah, really common phrases from the nineteen 
sixties. Let’s listen to the dialogue again, a little bit slower, and then we’ll come back and 
look at some phrases from the sixties. 
A: Hey man... I really like your pad. Those lava
lamps are far out! Thanks for letting me crash
here tonight.
B: It’s no problem, brother! I wanted a pad where
people could come, listen to music and just hang
loose, you dig what I’m saying?
A: I dig it man! We could throw a bash here and
make it a really happening scene!
B: Yeah man, that would be groovy! Hey, I gotta split
for a while, are you OK here by yourself?
A: Don’t worry about me brother... You go take care
of business.
B: Alright, peace out.
E: Alright, well, I wanna get started at looking at these, uh, nineteen sixties slang phrases, 
so, let’s go now with “putting it together”. 
Voice: Putting it together. 
M: Alright, on putting it together today let’s start with the first part – he talked about 
“you dig what I’m saying?” 
E: “I dig it, man”. 
M: You dig what I’m saying? 
E: To dig it. 
M: Alright, so, we know the verb dig, which means to make a hole, right? 
E: Yeah. 
M: But now, he’s talking about understand. 
E: Yeah, basically, um, you dig what I’m saying - do you understand what I’m saying? 
M: And when he says “I dig it”, he says “I understand”. 
E: Yep. 
M: Okay, now, there’s also another meaning to this, right? Apart fromunderstand. 
E: Yeah, it can also mean “I like it”. 
M: Okay, so, I really dig this type of music. 
E: Or I really dig this restaurant. 
M: Okay, so, it’s kind of “I like it”. 
E: Uhu. 
M: Alright, now, moving on… he said “we could throw a bash here”. 
E: Alright, throw a bash. 
M: To throw a bash. 
E: So, first of all, what is a bash? 
M: A bash is a party. 
E: A really great party. 
M: An amazing party. 
E: Now, I wanna look at this verb to throw something, so, we kn… 
M: Okay. 
E: We… we know that you throw a ball, right? 
M: Right. 
E: But how can you throw a party? 
M: Well, it’s basically saying you organize or you host a party. 
E: Okay, and how can you use this phrase? 
M: Okay, so, I can say, uh, “last week I threw a birthday party in my house”. 
E: Okay, or “let’s throw a bash to celebrate your engagement”. 
M: Okay, or “next week I’m gonna throw a dinner party at my house”. 
E: Okay, so, to throw a party and it’s usually used for… for parties, right? 
M: Right, you wouldn’t throw a… 
E: Throw a meeting. 
M: Alright. 
E: No. 
M: Exactly. 
E: Not. 
M: Hehe. Okay. So now, we heard them use the ph… word man a lot, right? 
E: Yeah. 
M: Hey, man. 
E: Yeah, that’s right! Now, this is so common even in modern English that I think we need 
some examples. 
Voice: Example one. 
A: Hey, man! Watch where you’re going! 
Voice: Example two. 
B: Yeah, man! That’s a great idea! 
Voice: Example three. 
C: Man! That was awesome! 
M: So, man is one of those words that you just use at the end of your sentences. 
E: Or at the beginning or… 
M: Or at the beginning. 
E: Anywhere. 
M: And, so, you say “hey, man” or “yeah, man”. 
E: Yeah, but what about, um, do you have to be a man to use it? Or do you have to be 
talking to a man to use it? 
M: No, not really. Men and women use the word man. 
E: Yeah. 
M: And you can call a girl like “hey, man, how are you?” 
E: Yeah, but that sort of means that she’s a really, really good friend like the same level of 
friend as your guy friends. 
M: Yeah, yeah, exactly. 
E: Okay. 
M: Very good! And now, for the last phrase on putting it together – he said “you go take 
care of business”. 
E: To take care of business. 
M: Okay, so, I have to take care of business. 
E: So, we’re not really talking about business and work here, are we? 
M: No, no, no, no. So, basically, what we’re saying is “go handle your affairs”. 
E: So, do the things you have to do. 
M: Okay, so, or solve your problem. 
E: Uhu. 
M: So, if I say “I have to go to city hall today and take care of some business”. 
E: So, you’re maybe gonna do something like… 
M: Pay my taxes… 
E: Yeah, yeah. 
M: Or something like that. 
E: Yeah. Okay, so, to take care of business. 
M: Uhu. Okay, so, we heard some great phrases, we saw these words, let’s listen to the 
dialogue for the last time and then we’ll come back and talk about this great decade. 
A: Hey man... I really like your pad. Those lava
lamps are far out! Thanks for letting me crash
here tonight.
B: It’s no problem, brother! I wanted a pad where
people could come, listen to music and just hang
loose, you dig what I’m saying?
A: I dig it man! We could throw a bash here and
make it a really happening scene!
B: Yeah man, that would be groovy! Hey, I gotta split
for a while, are you OK here by yourself?
A: Don’t worry about me brother... You go take care
of business.
B: Alright, peace out.
M: Alright, so, nineteen sixties, very famous among rock music, the peace… 
E: Yeah. 
M: And conflicts and all this stuff. 
E: Yeah, that’s right, and I guess in, um… in English or Anglo pop culture we look back at 
this decade, um, very fondly. 
M: Yeah, and also we’re really related to the hippie movement, right? 
E: Yeah, yeah. 
M: People with long hair and baggy clothes and… 
E: Yeah. 
M: You know, living in their cars, going from concert to concert. 
E: Yeah, and I… I mean, speaking of music, I think if we think nineteen sixties, at least in… 
in Anglo world… 
M: Uhu. 
E: In Anglo world, we think of the best music like I think this is the golden age of music in… 
in, um, English speaking countries. 
M: Yes, it was a very good era and, well, what do you guys think? Do you think the sixties 
was the best decade or maybe you are more fond of the seventies? 
E: Yeah. 
M: The disco era. 
E: Or even the nineties, so, there’s some pretty good music in nineteen ninety four. 
M: Exactly, so, come to our website and let us know what you think and also if you have
