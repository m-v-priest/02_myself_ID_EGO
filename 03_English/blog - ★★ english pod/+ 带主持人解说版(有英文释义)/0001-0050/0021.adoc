M: Hello English learners and welcome back to another great lesson with EnglishPod! My 
name is Marco. +
E: And I’m Erica. +
M: And today we’re bringing you a great intermediate lesson with some really useful 
vocabulary. +
E: Some vocabulary you can use to describe your job. +
M: Yes, this is a really common situation when you… someone asks you what you do and 
you have to tell them. +
E: Exactly, so, today’s lesson is all about that. +
M: So, before we jump into our dialogue, let’s start with our “vocabulary preview”. +
Voice: Vocabulary preview. +
E: We have two simple phrases today that you’ll hear in our dialogue for our vocabulary 
preview. The first one is VP. +
M: VP. +
E: VP. +
M: So, the VP of a company is… +
E: The Vice-President. +
M: The Vice-President, exactly. +
E: Yeah, simple little acronym. +
M: Right. +
E: And the next word is Fortune 500 (five hundred) company. +
M: Fortune Five 500 company. +
E: Fortune Five 500 company. +
M: So, a Fortune 500 company is… +
E: I’ll let you explain. +
M: Hehe. Well, Fortune Magazine ranks the five hundred biggest companies in the U.S. +
E: So, a Fortune 500 company basically is… +
M: One of the five hundred biggest companies in the U.S. +
E: Okay, that’s simple. +
M: Yep. +
E: Alright, well, with those words it sounds like we’re going to be talking to some important 
people today. +
M: Yes, we are gonna be talking to some important people, so, let’s listen to our dialogue 
for the first time. Now, it’s gonna be a little bit fast, but you don’t have to worry about it. +
E: Cause we’ll come back and explain all of the important vocabulary. +
A: Oh, look, there’s Veronica and her boyfriend. 
She’s always going on about him at the office. Oh,
great, they saw us. They’re coming this way. +
B: Oh, man... +
C: Jessica! Arthur! Hi! I’d like you to meet my 
boyfriend Greg, he’s the V. P. of quality and safety
for a top Fortune 500 food company. +
A: Nice to meet you. This is my husband, Arthur. +
B: Hey, how’s it going? +
D: Hello. +
A: Veronica talks about you all the time. I guess you 
must be pretty busy at work. +
D: Well, yeah, a V. P. position is not easy, you know! I 
implement policies and procedures nationwide. of
various departments, as well as train junior man-
agers in FDA and EPA regulations. I also have to
oversee daily ope +
B: Wow, yeah... that sounds exciting. +
D: And what about you, Arthur? What do you do for 
a living? +
B: Oh, I’m a Top Gun pilot! 
 
M: Alright, great music for our dialogue again, ha? +
E: Chosen by… +
M: By moi. Hehe. +
E: Of course. +
M: Yeah, Top Gun is one of my old time favorite movies and Top Gun pilot, what a cool 
profession? +
E: An excellent profession, much cooler than being like a VP. +
M: A VP. +
E: Yeah. +
M: How boring is it? +
E: Yeah, anyway, this guy was a bit of a jerk, don’t you think? +
M: Yeah, you can tell a little bit of, uh, the sarcastic tone he had in his voice. +
E: Definitely, but he did use some interesting phrases and we can talk about those now. +
M: Right, so, let’s take a look at “language takeaway”. +
Voice: Language takeaway. +
E: Our first word for language takeaway is implement. +
M: Implement. +
E: Implement. +
M: Implement. +
E: Let’s listen to some examples of this word to help us understand its meaning. +
Voice: Example one. +
A: Our company has to implement this sales strategy. +
Voice: Example two. +
B: Sarah will be responsible for implementing the plan. +
Voice: Example three. +
C: I implemented several new policies. +
M: Okay, great examples, and just in case to implement means to… +
E: Put into action +
M: To put into action, great. +
E: Exactly. +
M: Our second word for language takeaway – policies. +
E: Policies. +
M: Policies. +
E: Policies. +
M: So, policies are basically rules and regulations. +
E: Exactly, formal rules. +
M: For a company or an organization. +
E: Exactly. +
M: Policies, great. +
E: Third word… +
M: Oversee. +
E: Oversee. +
M: Oversee. +
E: Oversee. +
M: So, when you oversee operations, it means… +
E: Like you watch it to make sure it’s okay. +
M: You supervise it. +
E: This is an excellent word to use when you wanna talk about your job responsibilities. +
M: Right. +
E: Oversee. +
M: Uhu, great. And our last word for language takeaway. It’s kind of tricky, so, let’s listen 
to how it was used in our dialogue. +
Example: That alone means I have fifteen hundred employees under me. Hehe. That alone 
means I have fifteen hundred employees under me. Hehe. +
E: So, this guy has fifteen hundred (1500) employees under him meaning he supervises 
fifteen hundred employees. +
M: Right, he manages fifteen hundred employees. +
E: He must be a busy man. +
M: Yes! For fifteen hundred employees… How many employees do you have under you, 
Erica? +
E: Uh, two. +
M: Yeah, not quite as much as fifteen hundred. +
E: Yeah, because I’m not a VP ???… for yet, hey? +
M: Hehe. Not yet, but you will. +
E: Okay. +
M: Alright, so, with this in mind, we are ready to listen to our dialogue for a second time 
and this time it’s gonna be slower. +
A: Oh, look, there’s Veronica and her boyfriend. 
She’s always going on about him at the office. Oh,
great, they saw us. They’re coming this way. +
B: Oh, man... +
C: Jessica! Arthur! Hi! I’d like you to meet my 
boyfriend Greg, he’s the V. P. of quality and safety
for a top Fortune 500 food company. +
A: Nice to meet you. This is my husband, Arthur. +
B: Hey, how’s it going? +
D: Hello. +
A: Veronica talks about you all the time. I guess you 
must be pretty busy at work. +
D: Well, yeah, a V. P. position is not easy, you know! I 
implement policies and procedures nationwide. of
various departments, as well as train junior man-
agers in FDA and EPA regulations. I also have to
oversee daily ope +
B: Wow, yeah... that sounds exciting. +
D: And what about you, Arthur? What do you do for 
a living? +
B: Oh, I’m a Top Gun pilot! 
 
M: Okay, great stuff! With this, now we can start with our “fluency builder” for today. +
Voice: Fluency builder. +
E: We heard some excellent phrases in this dialogue, some phrases that sound really 
natural, hey? +
M: Yes! Especially the first one that we have today is… Whenever someone talks and talks 
and talks and just… and continuously talks without stopping, you would say…
Phrase 1: She’s always going on about him at the office. She’s always going on about
him at the office. +
E: This is a really natural way of saying “keeps talking about”. +
M: Right, keeps talking about him. +
E: Yep, so, we have a few examples of how this phrase works. Let’s listen. +
Voice: Example one. +
A: My boss is always going on about how we need to save money; it’s all he talks about. +
Voice: Example two. +
B: Gary is always going on about his kids; he’s always talking about how smart they are. +
Voice: Example three. +
C: My mom is always going on about how I should get married. +
M: Okay, excellent! It’s clear now. +
E: Yes. +
M: Okay, so, let’s move on to our second phrase for today and this is a great one to use 
whenever you meet someone for the first time. +
E: Or when you start to talk to someone for the first time. +
M: Great. 
Phrase 2: Hey, how’s it going? Hello. Hey, how’s it going? Hello. +
E: So, this is a really relaxed and natural way of saying “How are you”. +
M: How are you? +
E: Yeah. +
M: So, yeah, you can just say “Hey, how’s it going?” +
E: Yep! +
M: Great. +
E: Really natural sounding. +
M: Now, our third phrase is the most important one of our dialogue. +
E: Yes! +
M: And it’s a really common situation. +
E: When someone asks you about your job, they might say this. 
Phrase 3: Arthur, what do you do for a living? Arthur, what do you do for a living? +
M: So, this is a really great way of asking “What work do you do?” or “What is your job?” +
E: Yes, and now… I know a lot of students sometimes say “What is your job?” +
M: Yeah, and that is… well, it’s kind of correct, but not really. +
E: It doesn’t sound very natural. +
M: Right. +
E: So, you wanna use “What do you do?” or… +
M: “What do you do for a living?” +
E: Sounds great. +
M: That’s the way you ask someone what is their job. +
E: And that’s how you sound supper natural. +
M: Hehe. Okay, so, we’re ready now to listen to our dialogue a last time and now you are 
ready to understand everything. +
A: Oh, look, there’s Veronica and her boyfriend. 
She’s always going on about him at the office. Oh,
great, they saw us. They’re coming this way. +
B: Oh, man... +
C: Jessica! Arthur! Hi! I’d like you to meet my 
boyfriend Greg, he’s the V. P. of quality and safety
for a top Fortune 500 food company. +
A: Nice to meet you. This is my husband, Arthur. +
B: Hey, how’s it going? +
D: Hello. +
A: Veronica talks about you all the time. I guess you 
must be pretty busy at work. +
D: Well, yeah, a V. P. position is not easy, you know! I 
implement policies and procedures nationwide. of
various departments, as well as train junior man-
agers in FDA and EPA regulations. I also have to
oversee daily ope +
B: Wow, yeah... that sounds exciting. +
D: And what about you, Arthur? What do you do for 
a living? +
B: Oh, I’m a Top Gun pilot! 
 
M: Okay, so, I have a little challenge for our listeners today. I have… +
E: What is it? +
M: Two challenges, actually. +
E: Okay. +
M: The first one – who performs the song that you heard and what is the song called? +
E: Okay, I don’t know the answer, so, I’m looking forward to seeing what users do. +
M: And the second one is what is the number one company in the Fortune 500? +
E: Oh, I also don’t know this answer. +
M: Hehe. Two great questions, so, I expect to see your answers on the comments page, but 
also we want to know about your profession. +
E: Yes! Tell us about your job, tell us what you do and use some of the great phrases you 
learned today to describe your answer. +
