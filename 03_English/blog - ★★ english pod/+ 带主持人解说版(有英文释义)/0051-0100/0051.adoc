M: Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. +
E: And I’m Erica. +
M: And today we’re bringing you another great lesson /and this time we’re gonna be
shopping 这次的主题是购物,我们要去购物. +
E: That’s right. Actually a lot of our users, um, *asked for* some… some lessons about
shopping, right? +
M: Exactly /and I think `主` one of the most important things when you go shopping `系` is to get a
good price. +
E: That’s right. +
M: So, we’re gonna be teaching you /how to bargain. +
E: So, Marco, you just mentioned a really great word, um, let’s look at it /in “vocabulary
preview”. +

Voice: Vocabulary preview. +
M: Alright, so, we’re gonna preview the word _bargain_ 讨价还价，谈判 today. +
E: Bargain. +
M: Bargain. +
E: Bargain. +
M: Now, this is an interesting word /because it’s a verb and a noun. +
E: That’s right, um, so, a bargain is a good price, right? +
M: Okay, so, a bargain is a good price. +
E: Yep, this t-shirt was a bargain, um, I only paid a dollar for it. 我只花了 1 美元就买到了. +
M: Okay, so /that is a bargain. +
E: Yes. +
M: But _to bargain_ as a verb…

[.my2]
而作为动词 “to bargain” 时… +

E: Um, to try and get a good price. +
M: So, it’s very similar to negotiate. +
E: Yeah, so, I would say "uh, it costs a hundred dollars". +
M: And then /I would say maybe "ah, I’ll give you fifty". +
E: "Ah, seventy five". +
M: Um, and I say "sixty". +
E: Etcetera 等等；以及其它, etcetera [NOTE: Etcetera = etc. = _and so on_ 等等，诸如此类, _and so forth_ 等等，诸如此类] +
M: Hehe. And that’s to bargain, right? +
E: Yep. +
M: Okay, so we’re gonna be bargaining 我们要讨价还价, uh, let’s listen to the dialogue for the first time /as
we have a woman bargaining in a store, right? +
E: That’s right. +

|A: Hello. May I help you? +
B: Yeah, this dress is really nice! How much is it? +
A: That one is one hundred and fifty dollars. +
B: One hundred and fifty dollars? What about this
other one over here? +
A: That’s one hundred and forty dollars. +
B: Hmm...that’s a bit out of my price range 价格范围. Can you
give me a better deal 更好的交易? +
A: This is an exclusive design 独家设计 by DaMarco! It’s a
bargain 便宜货，减价品；协议，交易 at that price. +
B: Well, I don’t know. I think I’ll *shop (v.) around* 四处逛逛,去别家看看(寻找最适合的商品或服务，以最低的价格). +
A: Okay, okay, how about one hundred dollars? +
B: That’s still *more than* I wanted to spend. What if I
take both dresses? +
A: Okay, I can give you a _special discount_ 特别折扣, just be-
cause you *seem like* a nice person. One hundred
and ninety dollars for both. +
B: I don’t know... It’s still a bit pricey (a.高价的，过分昂贵的) 还是有点贵.... Thanks any-
way 不过还是谢谢您了. +
A: Okay, my final price! One hundred dollars for
both! That’s two /for the price of one. That’s my
last offer! +

[.my2]
相当于买一送一（two for the price of one）

B: Great! You’ve got a deal 成交!
|===


 
M: Alright, that was some good bargaining skills right there. +
E: Yeah, and, you know what, she used a lot of good language 很多实用的表达 to get, ah, a cheaper price,
didn’t she? +
M: Yeah, yeah, that was good. So, let’s take a look at this language in “language 
takeaway”. +

Voice: Language takeaway. +
M: Okay, the first word we have _in language takeaway_ today -- price range 价格范围、预算. +
E: Price range. +
M: Price range. +
E: Price range. +
M: Price range. What does it mean exactly? +
E: So, _price range_ is, uh, the minimum and the maximum /that you’re willing to spent for a
thing that you wanna buy. +
M: Exactly, so, in the dialogue /we heard _it’s out of my price range_. +
E: It’s more than I can spend. +
M: More than I could spend. +
E: Yeah. +

M: Okay. Okay, let’s look at our next word -- shop around 货比三家、去别家看看. +
E: Shop around. +
M: Shop around. +
E: Shop around. +
M: So, she said "I’ll think… I think I’ll shop around". +
E: Right, um, so she wants to check /in a few other stores /to see if there’s a better price. +
M: If I shop around /I’m going and trying *to compare (v.) prices* maybe. +
E: Exactly, this is a really good, um, shopping technique. +
M: Yeah, it is. +
E: Yeah. +

M: Okay, and let’s look at our last word -- pricy  贵的、偏贵的. +
E: Pricy. +
M: Pricy. +
E: Pricy. +
M: So, something that’s pricy is… +
E: Expensive. +
M: Expensive. +
E: Yep, this is, uh… _a more sort of_ informal way of saying expensive. +

[.my2]
“pricy” 是 “expensive” 的一种更口语化的说法

M: Exactly, so *instead of* saying "Wow! That car is really expensive!" +
E: It’s really pricy. +
M: It’s really pricy. +
E: Yeah. +

M: Okay, let’s listen to our dialogue for the second time /and it’s gonna be slowed down 减缓速度 a bit. +
E: So you’ll understand some of these great words /a little bit better. +

|A: Hello. May I help you? +
B: Yeah, this dress is really nice! How much is it? +
A: That one is one hundred and fifty dollars. +
B: One hundred and fifty dollars? What about this

A: Okay, my final price! One hundred dollars for
both! That’s two for the price of one. That’s my
last offer! +
B: Great! You’ve got a deal!

M: So, we’ve covered the language in this dialogue, now let’s take a look at some of the 
phrases /in “putting it together”. +
Voice: Putting it together. +
E: So, Marco, in this dialogue /there’s a lot of really useful phrases, um, to help you get a
better price /when you shop, right? +
M: Exactly. +
E: So, the first one we have is _can you give me a better deal_? +
M: Can you give me a better deal? +
E: Can you give me a better deal? +
M: So, if I’m shopping /and something is too expensive… +
E: Yeah. +
M: I would use this sentence with the shopkeeper （通常指小商店的）店主. +

[.my2]
我会对店主说这句话.

E: Yeah, so you might say, um, "hey, this is out of my price range, could you give me a 
better deal?" +
M: Can you give me a better deal? +
E: Yep. +
M: Okay, we have some examples of _can you give me a better deal_, let’s listen. +

Voice: Example one. +
A: I really like this shirt, but it’s too expensive. Can you give me a better deal? +

Voice: Example two. +
B: Can you give me a better price /on this car? I really don’t have that much money. +

E: So, you can see here that /you can say "can you give me a better deal" or "can you give
me a better price". +

M: Alright, let’s take a look at our next phrase -- _that’s still more than I wanted to spend_. +
E: That’s still more than I wanted to spend. +
M: That’s still more than I wanted to spend. +
E: So, if the seller suggests (v.) a really high price /you can say… +
M: That’s still more than I wanted to spend. So basically /you’re telling the shopkeeper… +
E: Still too expensive. +
M: It’s still too expensive. +
E: Yeah. +
M: You still don’t want to spend that much. +
E: Uhu. +

M: Alright, let’s take a look at our last phrase. +
E: That’s my last offer 这是我最后的报价了. +
M: That’s my last offer. +
E: That’s my last offer. +
M: Now, this could work (v.) both ways. It could be the shopkeeper /that's telling you that.   +

[.my2]
这句话双方都能用。可能是店主跟你说…

E: That’s my lowest price. +
M: Right. Or you could say /that’s my last offer. +
E: That’s my highest price, if you are buying it. +
M: Right, because sometimes /when you're bargaining /the shopkeeper will say "alright,
_what’s your best offer_ 那你最多能出多少钱, how much will you pay?" +
E: "Hundred dollars, that’s my final offer". +
M: Exactly. +
E: Uhu. +

M: Alright, so, we’ve looked at _a lot of_ great phrases and words /and now you’re ready to
bargain /and also listen to this dialog for the third time /and then we’ll come back and talk
some more. +

M: Alright, so I know that /in Canada /it’s not really common to bargain 砍价其实不太常见, right? +
E: No, it… it really isn’t /like even when you go to the market to buy fruits and vegetables,
uh, it’s very very rare /to bargain with the shopkeeper. +

[.my2]
确实不常见。就算是去市场买水果蔬菜，也很少会跟摊主砍价。

M: Uhu, uhu. +
E: How about in Ecuador 厄瓜多尔（位于拉丁美洲）? +
M: No, in Ecuador /you definitely bargain 你肯定会讨价还价. +
E: Really? +
M: Well, if you go to the mall, for example… +
E: Yep. +
M: Or if you go to a supermarket, of course you wouldn’t really bargain. 去超市，那肯定不用砍价 +
E: Yeah. +
M: Unless maybe you go to a small store /or you go to one of the local markets. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Then it’s more common to bargain. +
E: Yeah. +
M: #And you have to, because people expect (v.) you to barging.# +

[.my2]
而且你必须砍价，因为卖家都默认你会砍价。

E: Really? +
M: Yeah, yeah, in many countries in the world /bargaining is almost like an art. +
E: Yeah, that’s true. Actually, Marco, you are an excellent bargainer 交易者；讨价还价的人, aren’t you? +
M: Hehe. Yeah, I’ve… I’ve been known (v.) *to bargain with* the shopkeepers /in… ah… I’ve been
known to bargain _a little bit_ 稍微地,有那么一点 with… with the shopkeepers /and helping out 帮忙. +

[.my2]
我确实有过跟店主砍价的经历，而且有时候还能帮别人砍到好价格。 +
熟悉我的人都知道，我（在购物时）会​​​​稍微​​​​跟店主讲一下价，帮（自己/大家）省点钱。

E: A little bit? I mean /you’ve got better prices *than* I can even imagine (v.) getting. +

[.my2]
我记得你砍到的价格，比我能想到的最低价还低呢！

M: Hehe. Yeah, that’s… that’s a good story /maybe we’ll get JP to… *to go to* our comments section 评论部分,评论区 /and tell you about that, ah… +
E: Yeah. +

M: So, we want to know about your countries. _Is it common_ to bargain? Do you really do it?
Is it okay? Or when is it okay? +
E: Yes, tell us. Visit our website at englishpod.com, tell us about, um, you country’s 
_bargaining customs_ 砍价习俗 and, um, also leave your questions there for us. +
M: Exactly, we’ll be there to answer them, but _until then_ 直到那时 we gotta go, so… Bye! +
E: Good bye!
