M: Hello everyone! Welcome back to another great lesson here with us at EnglishPod! My 
name is Marco. +
E: And I’m Erica. +
M: And today we’re gonna be getting money. +
E: That’s right. We’re going to have a lesson about the ATM. +
M: The ATM or… +
E: Automatic Teller Machine. +
M: Okay, that’s what it stands for, ATM. +
E: Uhu. +
M: So, we’re gonna be looking at the language that you’ll probably find in an ATM maybe in 
the United States or in an English speaking country. +
E: That’s right. Um, but before we begin, why don’t we look at some vocabulary that we’ll 
hear in the dialogue? +
Voice: Vocabulary preview. +
M: As we mentioned, the ATM or automatic teller machine is the machine where you get 
your money, right? +
E: Exactly. +
M: And also, well, some people or in different places they may call it the bank machine. +
E: Yeah, or maybe the cash machine. +
M: Uhu. +
E: Uhu. +
M: Or just a money machine or something. Alright… +
E: So, ATM. +
M: ATM. And now, let’s take a look at our next word. +
E: Local authorities. +
M: The local authorities. +
E: The local authorities. +
M: So, what are the local authorities? +
E: Well, basically, it’s the police. +
M: The police. +
E: Uhu. +
M: Why do you say local authorities? +
E: Okay, well, authority is, uh, the person in charge, right? +
M: Uhu. +
E: The boss. +
M: Uhu. +
E: So, the local authorities are basically people who are the boss of this place. +
M: In that area. +
E: Yeah, so… +
M: Okay. +
E: The police. +
M: The local authorities. +
E: Uhu. +
M: So, why don’t we start now with our dialogue? Why are we talking about local authorities 
and ATM machines? +
E: I don’t know. We gotta listen to find out. +
A: Stupid girl, making me spend so much money, 
now I have to get it from the ATM... +
B: Hello, welcome to Universal Bank. Please insert 
your card into the slot. +
A: I know where to put my card! Stupid machine, 
talking to me like I’m an idiot... +
B: Please input your 6 digit PIN code followed by the 
pound key. Thank you. Please select an option.
Thank you. You have selected withdrawal. +
A: Yeah, yeah, I know what I selected. Just gimme 
my money! +
B: Please type the amount you would like to with- 
draw. Thank you, you want to transfer 10000 USD
to the World Wildlife Foundation. If this is correct
please press 1. +
A: No, no! Stupid machine, what are you doing! No! +
B: Confirmed. Thank you for using our bank! Please 
remove your card from the slot. Goodbye! +
C: Danger, danger! The exits have been sealed and 
the doors will remain locked in until the local au-
thorities arrive. Thank you for using our bank.
Have a nice day. +
A: No! 
 
M: Alright, so, it’s not his day today. I think he was very, uh, unlucky and I… maybe he’s 
gonna be in trouble. +
E: I know and he was on a date. This is probably one of the worst things that can happen to 
a guy when he’s on a date. +
M: Alright, yeah, so, well, we saw some of, ah, language that was related to an ATM, money 
and banking. +
E: Uhu. +
M: So, why don’t we take a look at that now in “language takeaway”? +
Voice: Language takeaway. +
E: Alright, so, the guy had to insert his card into the slot. +
M: Okay, so, slot. +
E: Slot. +
M: Alright, slot. And that is an opening, right? Or a type of hole, maybe. +
E: Yeah, it’s a hole that is usually long. +
M: Long and… it’s like a rectangular hole. +
E: Yeah, it.. a slot is never a circle. +
M: Okay, so, for example, when you get mail… +
E: Uhu. +
M: The mailman will put into your mailbox through the slot. +
E: That’s right. +
M: Okay. Now, well… and now that he put his card into the slot, he had to input a six-digit 
PIN code. +
E: Wanna just do both together? Digit and PIN code. +
M: Yeah. +
E: Okay, so, a six-digit PIN code. +
M: Alright, now, we have two words here that are new. Digit. +
E: Digit is basically a number between zero and nine. +
M: Okay, so, any number between zero and nine is considered a digit. +
E: Yes, so, one hundred (100) is made up of three digits. +
M: Three digits, okay. +
E: Uhu. +
M: And what about PIN code? [NOTE: PIN is the acronym that stands for a personal 
identification number] +
E: A PIN code is your secret number that you use to take money out. +
M: Now, why wouldn’t we say password? +
E: Password is usually letters. +
M: Okay, and PIN code is numbers. +
E: Exactly. +
M: Alright. He had to input his six-digit PIN code and then, after that, he had to press the 
pound key. +
E: Pound key. +
M: Now, this is strange, a pound key, what is that? +
E: Well, you know on a phone… +
M: Uhu. +
E: On the bottom right… +
M: Aha. +
E: There’s a key, um, th… or a button that looks like a number sign. +
M: Number sign, so, kind of like two vertical lines and two horizontal lines. +
E: Yeah, two lines going up and down, two lines going across. +
M: Okay, so, that’s called the pound key. +
E: Uhu. +
M: Alright, what about the other one? +
E: It’s called the star. +
M: The star. +
E: Star key. +
M: The star key, alright. So, after the PIN code, after the pound key, now he’s ready to 
withdraw money. +
E: Uhu. So, we heard withdrawal. +
M: Okay, so, withdrawal is… +
E: Is a noun; it’s the action of taking money out. +
M: Okay a withdrawal. +
E: A withdrawal. +
M: Okay, and to withdraw. +
E: To withdraw is just the verb. +
M: To take out money, right? +
E: Exactly. +
M: So, we have the noun and the verb. The only difference is an –al at the end. +
E: Yes, so withdrawal – noun, and withdraw – verb. +
M: Okay, and, well, he wanted to withdraw money, but something happened with the ATM 
and it turned out that he was gonna transfer money. [NOTE: we have here the future in
the past; please check this link and listen to this lesson for more information about this
grammar topic] +
E: Oh-oh. +
M: Hehe. So, transfer. +
E: Transfer. +
M: Transfer. +
E: When you transfer money, you take it from one place and put it in another. +
M: Okay, and usually in banking when you transfer money, you don’t really see it, right? +
E: Exactly. +
M: It’s all electronic… +
E: Uhu. +
M: So, you just put it from one bank account to another, but you never actually see this 
money. +
E: Exactly, so, transfer money. +
M: Transfer. +
E: And now, this one also has a verb and a noun, right? +
M: Right, a transfer. +
E: And to transfer. +
M: Same word. +
E: Uh, yep. +
M: Easy. Alright, so, why don’t we listen to our dialogue for the second time? It’s gonna be 
slowed down a little bit and then we’ll come back and look at some phrases. +
A: Stupid girl, making me spend so much money, 
now I have to get it from the ATM... +
B: Hello, welcome to Universal Bank. Please insert 
your card into the slot. +
A: I know where to put my card! Stupid machine, 
talking to me like I’m an idiot... +
B: Please input your 6 digit PIN code followed by the 
pound key. Thank you. Please select an option.
Thank you. You have selected withdrawal. +
A: Yeah, yeah, I know what I selected. Just gimme 
my money! +
B: Please type the amount you would like to with- 
draw. Thank you, you want to transfer 10000 USD
to the World Wildlife Foundation. If this is correct
please press 1. +
A: No, no! Stupid machine, what are you doing! No! +
B: Confirmed. Thank you for using our bank! Please 
remove your card from the slot. Goodbye! +
C: Danger, danger! The exits have been sealed and 
the doors will remain locked in until the local au-
thorities arrive. Thank you for using our bank.
Have a nice day. +
A: No! 
 
E: Okay, so, that was a little easier to understand, um… +
M: Uhu. +
E: But, Marco, there’re some interesting phrases here, some instructions that you 
commonly, um, read or hear when you’re using a bank machine. +
M: So, why don’t we take a look at these phrases in “fluency builder”? +
Voice: Fluency builder. +
E: Well, the bank machine told this guy to insert your card. +
M: Insert your card. +
E: Insert your card. +
M: So, this verb - to insert. +
E: Uhu. +
M: To place inside. +
E: Exactly, so, what else can we insert? +
M: Well, for example, commonly you insert a disc. +
E: Yeah, in your computer. +
M: In your computer, right? +
E: Yeah, or maybe insert a CD into your CD-player. +
M: Or DVD into your DVD-player. +
E: Yep. +
M: Alright, so, to insert something - to put inside. +
E: Yes. +
M: So, he had to insert his card into the slot. +
E: And then the bank machine asked him to select an option. +
M: Select an option. +
E: Select an option. +
M: Now, this is a very common, ah, phrase that you will… not only see in ATMs, but 
basically everywhere, right? +
E: Like in… computers or the Internet or many… many things where you’re dealing with 
machines. +
M: Uhu. So, it’s a… it’s an order that says “well, select one of these choices that you have”. +
E: Make a choice. +
M: Make a choice. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Select an option. Alright, so… two simple phrases, but very useful and also very high 
frequency, right? +
E: Yeah, and you know what? When you use phrases like these two, it sounds quite 
professional, doesn’t it? +
M: Yeah, a… a little bit formal. +
E: Uhu. +
M: Okay. So, why don’t we listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we’ll come back 
and talk a little bit more. +
A: Stupid girl, making me spend so much money, 
now I have to get it from the ATM... +
B: Hello, welcome to Universal Bank. Please insert 
your card into the slot. +
A: I know where to put my card! Stupid machine, 
talking to me like I’m an idiot... +
B: Please input your 6 digit PIN code followed by the 
pound key. Thank you. Please select an option.
Thank you. You have selected withdrawal. +
A: Yeah, yeah, I know what I selected. Just gimme 
my money! +
B: Please type the amount you would like to with- 
draw. Thank you, you want to transfer 10000 USD
to the World Wildlife Foundation. If this is correct
please press 1. +
A: No, no! Stupid machine, what are you doing! No! +
B: Confirmed. Thank you for using our bank! Please 
remove your card from the slot. Goodbye! +
C: Danger, danger! The exits have been sealed and 
the doors will remain locked in until the local au-
thorities arrive. Thank you for using our bank.
Have a nice day. +
A: No! 
 
M: Alright, Erica, so, what about you? Have you ever had any problems with the ATM? +
E: I’ve had more problems than I can count. +
M: Hehe. What happened? +
E: Well, I think in the last two years I’ve probably lost about seven bank cards in an ATM. +
M: Really? +
E: Yeah. +
M: You forget it… +
E: Yes. +
M: In the slot. +
E: Yeah, I leave it in the slot and then walk away from the bank machine and… no bank 
cards. +
M: Well, I think now the ATMs, because this is the common problem… +
E: Yeah. +
M: Um, now they have like a little alarm that when you take out your money and 
everything, it just starts beeping and beeping until you take out your card. +
E: Yes and I like the bank machines that actually give you your card first… +
M: Uhu. +
E: And then give you your money. +
M: Ah. +
E: Cause if they give me my money first, that’s all I want, right? +
M: Hehe. +
E: So, I run away with my money and leave my card in the bank machine. +
M: Hehe. Right, I think that’s a good idea. I’ve… I’ve never seen that before, though. +
E: In Switzerland they have them like that. +
M: In Switzerland. +
E: Yeah. +
M: Or what about the ATMs that you only have to swipe your card? [NOTE: in this context 
swipe means to pass your card through a special machine/device that “reads” the
information encoded in a magnetic strip of the card] +
E: Oh, yeah, I’ve done that as well and also ruined a bank card with that. +
M: Hehe. +
E: I swiped it too many times, put in a wrong PIN code and… +
M: It blocked your card. +
E: Yeah, terrible. +
M: Hehe. Well, what about you guys? I su… I’m sure everyone has some experience or 
some inconvenience with ATM machines. So, why don’t you come to our website and tell us
all about it? +
E: You can also find lots more resources on our website, uh, to help your learn English, so 
check it out and until next time… +
M: Good bye! +
E: Bye!
