M: Hello English learners! Welcome to EnglishPod! My name is Marco.  +
E: And I’m Erica.  +
M: And today we’re back /bringing you another great lesson, ah, an intermediate 中级的；中等水平的 lesson.  +
E: That’s right, about one of my favorite subjects.  主题还是我最受喜爱的领域之一  +
M: We’re talking about food.  +
E: Exactly.  +
M: Hehe. So, on this occasion 场合；时机 /we’re gonna （即 going to） be talking about food, so, let’s preview (v.) some words on “vocabulary preview”.  +

Voice: Vocabulary preview.  +
E: Alright, we have three words for you today. Um, and the first word is _head chef_ (厨师，主厨) 主厨（厨房负责人）.  +
M: Head chef.  +
E: Head chef.  +
M: So, what is a head chef?  +
E: Well, in a professional 专业的；职业的 kitchen, um, this is _the boss of the kitchen_ or _the leader of the kitchen_.  +
M: Okay, so, the _head chef_ is the… the main cook (厨师，炊事员) 主要的厨师…  +
E: Yes, but…  +
M: Sort of saying. 差不多是这个意思  +
E: He doesn’t cook  (v.)煮，烧；烹饪 +
M: He… but he doesn’t cook.  +
E: Okay.  +
M: Alright, so if he doesn’t cook (v.), who’s the one /that… does the cooking?  +

E: Um, that brings us to our second word, _sous (a.)担任助理的 chef_ 副主厨（主厨助手）.  +
M: Sous chef.  +
E: Sous chef.  +
M: Sous chef.  +
E: S-O-U-S.  +
M: So, the S is silent 不发音的.  +

[.my2]
所以最后一个字母 “S” 在这里是不发音的。

E: Uhu.  +
M: Because it’s like a French 法语的；法国的 word.  +
E: Yeah, something like that 类似这样的,差不多是这样.  +
M: Okay. So, the _sous chef_ is _the second_ in line 排在第二位的；仅次于的 _to_ the head chef.  +

[.my2]
所以副主厨就是仅次于主厨的第二负责人。

E: Yea, he’s the number two.  +
M: Number two.  +
E: Uhu.  +
M: So, he’s basically the one /that’s doing some of the work.  +

[.my2]
所以基本上厨房里的实际烹饪工作, 是由副主厨来承担一部分

E: Yeah.  +
M: In the kitchen.  +
E: Yep.  +

M: Now, let’s take a look at our last word, cuisine 烹饪，风味；饭菜，菜肴;烹饪法；菜肴（尤指某国或某地区的）.  +

M: French cuisine, which includes all the food.  +

[.my2]
“法国菜（French cuisine）” 就包含了法国所有的特色食物。

M: To become a chef 厨师.  +
E: Yep.  +

E: Well, um, we’re in a restaurant, um, and it’s a really busy night /and so, we’re going to listen to what is happening in the kitchen.  +

M: Yeah. Hehe. Yeah, you can… you can tell _in his voice_ that /he’s really *stressed out* 焦虑不安的；压力大的.  +

M: Alright, now let’s take a look at our next word, chop.  +
E: Chop 切；剁碎.  +
M: Chop.  +
E: Chop.  +
M: So, again another verb and it means to…  +
E: It means to cut food into pieces 小块；碎片.  +

E: Uhu.  +
M: To stir (v.) is very similar to 与…… 相似 mix.  +
E: Yes.  +

M: Move the food around.  +
E: Yep.  +

M: Okay, our next word, butchered 屠宰；处理肉类.  +
E: Again the past participle （语法）分词 of the word butcher 屠宰.  +
M: Okay, butcher.  +
E: Butcher.  +
M: Now, this is a verb to butcher something.  +
E: Uhu.  +
M: It’s when you remove all the bones 骨头 and all the organs 器官 from the meat 肉.  +
E: Exactly, so you cut up 切碎 the meat.  +
M: And this is interesting /because that’s also a noun.  +
E: Right, a butcher 屠夫；肉店；刽子手 is the person /who cuts up meat.  +
M: Okay, so… so it’s really easy, a butcher butchers (v.) meat.  +

M: Uhu.  +

M: Okay.  +

M: Okay.  +
E: Simple.  +
M: So, to put butter on something.  +
E: Yep.  +
M: So you can butter (v.) a piece of bread 面包.  +
E: Exactly.  +
M: Or in this case /the fish is being buttered.  +
E: Uhu.  +
M: Sounds (v.) delicious 美味的；可口的.  +
E: Yes.  +
M: Okay, now we’re ready to listen to our dialogue for the second time, we’re gonna slow it down a little bit /so it’s easier to understand.  +
  +

\...  +
\...  +
\...  +

M: Okay, so that seems (v.) to be a little bit better.  +
E: Uhu. And, hey, I noticed that /there’s a lot of really great kitchen words 非常棒的厨房用语 in here /like words that you commonly 通常；常常 hear in a professional kitchen.  +
M: Okay. So let’s take a look at these kitchen words /in “fluency builder”.  +

Voice: Fluency builder.  +
E: Alright, we’ve got three phrases, ah, and the first one is _in the weeds_ (野草，杂草) 陷入细节或复杂性中;忙得不可开交.  +
M: In the weeds.  +
E: In the weeds.  +
M: In the weeds.  +
E: So, when you _in the weeds_, you’re so so busy /and you can’t do all the work you need to do _on time_ 按时；准时.  +
M: Okay, so, _in the weeds_, it means that /you’re really busy.  +
E: Yes.  +
M: And…  +
E: You can’t finish 完成；结束 everything.  +
M: And you can’t… you have too much to do.  +
E: Yep.  +
M: Okay, in the weeds.  +
E: Uhu.  +

M: Okay, our next word, running low on 快用完；快耗尽.  +
E: Running low on.  +
M: Running low on.  +
E: Running low on.  +
M: Okay, so before we get into explaining 解释；说明 what _running lo（此处应为 “low”） on_ means, let’s listen to some examples.  +

Voice: Example one.  +
A: You’d better *look for* a gas station 加油站，we’re _running low /on_ fuel 燃料；燃油.  +

Voice: Example two.  +
B: We’re _running low /on_ beers. Can you go out /and get some?  +

Voice: Example three.  +
C: My flashlight 手电筒 is running low /on battery 电池，hurry up 快点；赶紧 before gets dark 变黑；变暗.  +

M: So basically _running low_ means…  +
E: Um, you don’t have much of this left 剩余；剩下.  +
M: You don’t have much of something left.  +
E: Yep, so here they’re *running low* on wine, so basically…  +
M: There’s no（此处应为 “not”） much wine left.  +
E: Right.  +
M: So as we’ve heard in the examples /you could also be *running low* on fuel, for example.  +

[.my2]
就像例子里提到的，也可以说 “running low on fuel（燃油快用完）”。

E: Uhu.  +
M: On your car…  +
E: Yep.  +

M: Etcetera 等等；诸如此类. Running low on. Alright /and now *let’s take a look at* our last word. Doing really well.  +
E: Doing really well 进展顺利；情况好.  +
M: We are doing really well.  +
E: Doing really well. So, *that seems to be like* a pretty simple structure 结构，I mean /we know all this words, right?  +

[.my2]
这个短语结构看起来挺简单的，里面的词我们应该都认识，对吧？

M: Uhu.  +
E: So, why is it special?  +
M: Well, basically, if you say _I’m doing really well_, maybe it sounds (v.) a little bit difficult to understand, what are you doing really well?  +

[.my2]
如果只说 “我进展得很顺利（I’m doing really well）”，可能别人会有点困惑 —— 你到底哪方面顺利呀？

E: Uh.  +
M: So, this is a great way of answering a question /when somebody says "how are you?" or "how are you doing?" you can say "oh, I’m doing really well".  +

[.my2]
所以这个短语很适合用来回答别人的问候，比如有人问 “你好吗？（how are you?）” 或者 “你最近怎么样？（how are you doing?）”，你就可以说 “哦，我挺好的（oh, I’m doing really well）”。

E: So…  +
M: Or "I’m doing well 我挺好的".  +
E: In your life /everything is good.  +
M: In your life /things are good /and you’re happy basically.  +
E: Yeah, but in this situation 情况；情形，in the dialogue, what’s doing really well?  +

[.my2]
但在对话的场景里，“doing really well” 指的是什么呢？

M: Well, the restaurant is doing really well, the business 生意；商业 is doing really well.  +
E: So when he says /we’re doing really well, um, business is…  +
M: Good.  +
E: Good, they’re making lots of money 钱.  +
M: Exactly.  +
E: Uhu.  +
M: So you can use it with people, you can use it with businesses, you can say "oh, I’m doing really well in my new job 工作".  +
E: Yep.  +
M: Or "my son is doing really well in school 学校".  +
E: Yep.  +
M: Okay, so, you can use /in… in those different ways.  +
E: Alright, well, let’s listen to the dialogue, ah, one last time /and we’ll be able to hear all of these great words and phrases /we’ve just talked about.  +
  +
...  +
...  +
...  +
  +

E: So, Marco, do you think /this chef had a rat 老鼠 under his hat?  +

[.my2]
你觉得这个厨师是不是像《美食总动员》里那样，帽子底下藏了一只老鼠呀？

M: Hehe. That was a really good movie 电影.  +
E: Yeah.  +
M: Ratatouille  (n.蔬菜杂烩；炖菜) 《料理鼠王》（迪士尼・皮克斯动画电影）.  +

[.my1]
.title
====
.Ratatouille
-> 来自法语ratatouille,蔬菜杂烩，一道法国原尼斯和普罗旺斯地区传统名菜。rata-,词义不详，可能来自##tat-,表小词，词源可能同tit,，touiller,搅拌，##来自拉丁语tudiculo,搅拌器，来自PIE*tud,击，打，词源同obtuse,obtund.+
这道菜与老鼠(rat)没有任何关系，后迪斯尼动画电影《Ratatouille》故事对此进行艺术化改造，讲述一只有天赋的小老鼠经过自身努力成为一代大厨的追梦故事，使得该菜名扬世界，故汉语翻译为《料理鼠王》。
====

E: Yeah.  +
M: Disney-Pixar.  +
E: Uh.  +
M: Where the rat is a cook 厨师.  +
E: Yes.  +
M: It’s interesting /I love to cook /but I’m not very good at cooking.  +
E: Really?  +
M: But it’s good /because _for me_… it helps me relieve (v.) stress 缓解压力（relieve 意为 “减轻；缓解”，stress 意为 “压力”）.  +
E: Me too, actually, you know, if I’m in a bad mood 心情；情绪 /I go home and cook (v.) something to eat /and… the world seems a happier place.  +
M: Hehe. And people don’t understand /because they think cooking is work 工作；活计.  +

[.my2]
（笑）可别人都不理解，觉得做饭是件麻烦事。

E: Yep.  +
M: But, you know, for some people /it’s fun 有趣的；使人快乐的.  +
E: Yeah.  +

M: So what about you guys? What did（此处应为 “do”） you like to cook? Do you have any particular 特定的；特别的 dish 菜肴 /that you prepare 准备；制作 very well?  +
E: And if you do, please send us the recipes 食谱；烹饪法.  +
M: Hehe. Exactly, because we know that /we have listeners from all over the world and, of course, we want to know /what type of food you prefer 更喜欢；偏爱.  +

M: Alright guys, we’re out of time 没时间了 /but we’ll see you next time.  +
E: Until then… good bye!  +
M: Bye! +
