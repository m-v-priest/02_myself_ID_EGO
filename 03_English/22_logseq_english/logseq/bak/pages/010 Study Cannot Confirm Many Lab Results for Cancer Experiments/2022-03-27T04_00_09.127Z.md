- # 010 Study Cannot Confirm Many Lab Results for Cancer Experiments
- pure text
  collapsed:: true
	- Eight years ago, a team of researchers launched a project to carefully repeat early and influential lab experiments in cancer research. The Reproducibility Project as it is called recreated 50 experiments. Now, it reports that about half of the experiments did not produce the results reported originally.
	- The reproducibility of experiments and confirmation of results is central to wide acceptance of scientific claims.
	- “The truth is we fool ourselves. Most of what we claim is novel or significant is no such thing,” said Dr. Vinay Prasad. He is a cancer doctor and researcher at the University of California, San Francisco and was not involved in the project.
	- Most scientists believe that the strongest findings come from experiments that can be repeated with similar results.
	- But there is little reason for researchers to share methods and data so others can confirm the work, said Marcia McNutt. She is president of the National Academy of Sciences. Researchers lose respect in the scientific community if their results do not hold up to careful study, she added.
	- For the project, the researchers tried to repeat experiments from cancer biology papers. The papers had appeared in major scientific publications, including Nature and Cell, from 2010 to 2012.
	- Overall, 54 percent of the original findings failed to meet conditions set by the Reproducibility Project. The team’s study appears in the journal eLife. The nonprofit eLife receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which also supports The Associated Press Health and Science Department.
	- Among the studies that did not hold up was one that claimed a link between a stomach bacteria and colon cancer. Another claimed a drug had shrunk tumors in mice. And, a third was a mouse study of a possible prostate cancer drug.
	- This is the second major study by the Reproducibility Project. In 2015, they found similar problems when they tried to repeat experiments in psychology.
	- Study co-writer Brian Nosek of the Center for Open Science said it can be wasteful to move forward without first doing the work to repeat findings.
	- The researchers tried to limit differences in how the cancer experiments were carried out. Often, they could not get help from the scientists who did the original work. They could not get answers to questions such as which kinds of mice to use or where to find specially engineered tumor cells.
	- Michael Lauer is a deputy director of research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). He said, “I wasn’t surprised, but it is concerning that about a third of scientists were not helpful, and, in some cases, were beyond not helpful.”
	- Lauer added that the NIH plans to require data-sharing among organizations to which it provides support in 2023.
	- Dr. Glenn Begley is a bio-technology advisor and former head of cancer research at drugmaker Amgen. Ten years ago, he and other scientists at Amgen reported even lower rates of confirmation when they tried to repeat published cancer experiments.
	- Cancer research is difficult, Begley said. He added that “it is very easy for researchers to be attracted to results that look exciting and provocative, results that appear to further support their favorite idea as to how cancer should work, but that are just wrong.”

	- Eight years ago, a team of researchers /launched a project /to carefully repeat(v.) early and influential **lab experiments** in cancer research. The Reproducibility Project **as it is called** recreated 50 experiments. Now, **it reports(v.) that** /about half of the experiments /did not produce the results /reported originally.
		- > ▶ reproducibility  n. [自] 再现性, 复现性
		- > ▶ recreate (v.)[ VN ] to make sth that existed in the past exist or seem to exist again 再现；再创造
		- 八年前，一组研究人员启动了一个项目，仔细地去重复(v.)早期那些有影响力的, 在癌症研究实验室中所做的实验。重现项目 -- 也就是所谓的"再现50个实验"。现在，它报告说，大约一半的实验, 没有产生出最初报告的结果。
	- **The reproducibility of experiments** and **confirmation of results** /**is central(a.) to** wide acceptance of **scientific claims**.
		- > ▶ central (a.)most important 最重要的；首要的；主要的
		  -> Reducing inflation is central(a.) to (= is an important part of) the government's economic policy. 减少通货膨胀是政府经济政策最重要的组成部分。
		- > ▶ claim (v.)(n.)[ C ] **~ (that...)** a statement that sth is true although it has not been proved and other people may not agree with or believe it 声明；宣称；断言
		  /**~ (on/to sth)** a right that sb believes they have to sth, especially property, land, etc. （尤指对财产、土地等要求拥有的）所有权
		- 实验的可重复性, 和对结果的确认, 对于科学主张要被广泛接受, 是非常重要的。

	- “The truth is /we fool(v.) ourselves. `主` Most of **what we claim is novel or significant** `谓` is no such thing,” said Dr. Vinay Prasad. He is a cancer doctor and researcher /at the University of California, San Francisco /and was not involved in the project.
		- > ▶ novel (a.)( often approving ) different from anything known before; new, interesting and often seeming slightly strange 新颖的；与众不同的；珍奇的
		- > ▶ significant (a.)large or important enough to have an effect or to be noticed 有重大意义的；显著的 /having a particular meaning 有某种意义的
		  -> a significant look/smile 意味深长的眼神╱微笑
		  => sign,标记，记号，-fic,做，使，词源同 fact,efficient.引申比喻词义重要的，有意义的等。
		- 事实是, 我们在欺骗自己。我们所说的大多数新奇或重要的东西, 其实都不存在。....他没有参与这个项目。
		-
	- Most scientists believe that /the strongest findings(n.) **come from** experiments /that can be repeated with similar results.
		- 最有力的发现, 来自于能被复现的实验.
	- But **there is little reason** for researchers to share(v.) methods and data /so others can confirm the work, said Marcia McNutt. She is president of _the National Academy of Sciences_. Researchers **lose respect in** the scientific community /if their results **do not hold up to** careful study, she added.
		- 研究人员几乎没有理由来分享研究方法和数据. ... 如果研究人员的研究结果, 经不起仔细的研究，他们就会失去科学界的尊重。
	- For the project, the researchers tried to repeat experiments /from **cancer biology papers**. The papers had appeared /in **major scientific publications**, including Nature and Cell, from 2010 to 2012.
		- > ▶ cancer biology  癌症生物学, 肿瘤生物学

		- 在那些不被证实成立的研究中，有一项是声称"胃部细菌和结肠癌之间存在联系"。另一项是声称"一种药物能缩小老鼠体内的肿瘤"。第三项是在老鼠身上进行的, 对一种可能作为"前列腺癌药物"的研究。
		-
	- This is the second major study /by **the Reproducibility Project**. In 2015, they found similar problems /when they tried to repeat experiments in psychology.

	- `主`  Study co-writer _Brian Nosek_ of the Center for **Open Science** `谓` said /**it can be wasteful** to move forward /without first doing the work /to repeat findings.
		- 在不先做"复现工作"之前就继续前进，就可能是一种浪费。
	- The researchers **tried to limit(v.) differences /in** how the cancer experiments were carried out. Often, they could not get help from the scientists /who did the original work.

		- > ▶ engineer (v.)[ usually passive ] to design and build sth 设计制造 /to change the genetic structure of sth 改变…的基因（或遗传）结构
		  -> genetically engineered crops 转基因农作物
		- 研究人员试图限制住 实验方式的差异。通常情况下，他们无法从最初的科学家那里得到帮助。他们无法得到答案, 诸如最开始使用的是哪一种老鼠? 或在哪里找到经过改造过的肿瘤细胞。
	- Michael Lauer is **a deputy director** of research at _the National **Institutes of Health**_ (NIH). He said, “I wasn’t surprised, but it is concerning that /about a third of scientists were not helpful, and, in some cases, were beyond not helpful.”
