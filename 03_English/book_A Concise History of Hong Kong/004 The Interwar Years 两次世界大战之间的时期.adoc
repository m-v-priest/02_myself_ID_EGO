The Interwar Years  两次世界大战之间的时期
Interwar Hong Kong is sometimes characterized as a sleepy colonial backwater, particularly when compared with Shanghai, the “Paris of the Orient.” This image overlooks how during the 1920s and 1930s Hong Kong was drawn more tightly than ever into the orbits of Chinese, British imperial, and world history.  +
The revolutionary nationalism in China ushered in an era of strikes and boycotts, both in China and in Hong Kong.  +
Struggles for political unity in China were accompanied by increasing vocal calls for abolishing the unequal treaties, extraterritoriality, and foreign concessions.  +
Such sentiments never led to any serious anticolonial movements in Hong Kong, but they helped make the 1920s considerably more politically charged than any other time in Hong Kong’s history.  +
With the rise of Socialism and the ascendancy of the Labour Party, colonialism and imperialism came increasingly under fire in Britain.  +
Although the British Empire reached the peak of its territorial expansion after World War I by inheriting some of the former Ottoman and German colonies and dependencies, the British share of industrial production and world trade declined, while the Washington Treaty of 1922 restricted Britain’s military power to protect its commercial interests in Asia.
两次世界大战之间的香港有时被描述为一个沉睡的殖民地边陲之地，尤其与“东方巴黎”上海相比更是如此。这种印象忽略了20世纪20年代和30年代香港比以往任何时候都更加紧密地卷入了中国、英国帝国和世界历史的漩涡之中。中国的革命民族主义开启了罢工和抵制运动的时代，中国内地和香港都出现了罢工和抵制运动。在中国争取政治统一的斗争中，要求废除不平等条约、治外法权和外国租界的呼声日益高涨。这些情绪虽然没有在香港引发任何严重的反殖民运动，但却使得20世纪20年代的政治氛围比香港历史上任何其他时期都更加紧张。随着社会主义的兴起和工党的崛起，殖民主义和帝国主义在英国也日益受到抨击。虽然大英帝国在第一次世界大战后通过继承一些前奥斯曼帝国和德国的殖民地和附属地达到了领土扩张的顶峰，但英国在工业生产和世界贸易中的份额却有所下降，而1922年的华盛顿条约限制了英国的军事力量，以保护其在亚洲的商业利益。 +



Because of the various interparty and provincial rivalries in China, Hong Kong was more affected than ever by events on the mainland—especially by the turbulent developments in neighboring Guangdong.  +
Not only was the city of Canton ruled by several successive regimes, but it also became a center for Chinese Communism.  +
The strife in Guangdong boosted Hong Kong’s population significantly: in 1921 the population was around 600,000; by 1931 it had risen to almost 850,000.  +
Furthermore, the crime encouraged by the political chaos in Guangdong often spilled over into Hong Kong.  +
In the 1920s, for example, piracy occurred weekly in Hong Kong waters.  +
In an especially notorious case in 1924, pirates seized a ferry from the island of Cheung Chau en route to Hong Kong.  +
After taking the passengers to a mainland lair, the pirates sent three of the victims’ ears to their relatives in demand for a ransom.
由于中国各党派和省份之间的纷争，香港比以往任何时候都更容易受到大陆局势的影响，尤其是邻近广东的动荡局势。广州不仅经历了数个政权的更迭，还成为了中国共产主义的中心。广东的动荡极大地促进了香港人口的增长：1921年香港人口约为60万，到1931年已增至近85万。此外，广东政治混乱滋生的犯罪活动也常常蔓延至香港。例如，在20世纪20年代，香港水域几乎每周都会发生海盗袭击事件。1924年发生了一起臭名昭著的案件：海盗劫持了一艘从长洲岛驶往香港的渡轮。他们将乘客带到大陆的藏身之处后，将其中三名受害者的耳朵送给他们的亲属索要赎金。 +



In the absence of a strong central government, some Hong Kong merchants tried to influence Chinese politics in order to protect their business interests on the mainland.  +
As historian Stephanie Chung writes, these men thus “developed a national orientation in politics outside the colony.”1 On the other hand, contrasting the stability of Hong Kong with the turbulence in China led many local Chinese, especially wealthier residents whose fortunes depended on Hong Kong’s colonial status, to identify increasingly with Hong Kong—witnessed by the way in which they collaborated with the colonial government to end the strikes of the 1920s.  +
A Western political scientist who visited Hong Kong on the eve of World War II observed that “one factor which has played a part in creating a class of Chinese who regard Hong Kong as their home is the insecurity which prevailed for many years in China.”2 This sense of belonging deepened as the colonial government became more willing to incorporate Chinese opinion, especially after the general strike of 1925–1926.
由于缺乏强有力的中央政府，一些香港商人试图影响中国政治，以保护他们在大陆的商业利益。正如历史学家斯蒂芬妮·钟所写，这些人因此“在殖民地之外的政治中形成了民族主义倾向”。 另一方面 ，香港的稳定与中国的动荡形成鲜明对比，使得许多香港本地华人，尤其是那些财富依赖于香港殖民地地位的富裕居民，越来越认同香港——他们与殖民政府合作结束 20 世纪 20 年代罢工的方式便是最好的证明。一位在二战前夕访问香港的西方政治学家指出，“中国多年来普遍存在的不安全感，是造成一批华人将香港视为家园的原因之一。 ” 随着殖民政府越来越愿意吸纳华人的意见，尤其是在 1925-1926 年大罢工之后，这种归属感进一步加深。 +



Advances in communications and transportation helped connect Hong Kong to the rest of the world and make the colony a popular tourist destination.  +
A 1920 guide for British tourists described Hong Kong as “the most interesting Port of Call for Visitors to the Far East, as it is also the most important commercial and shipping centre in this part of the world.”3 The prominent Chinese scholar and reformer Hu Shi recalled a trip to Hong Kong in the late 1920s, insisting that the city’s night skyline was among the world’s best.  +
An airfield opened in 1928 at Kai Tak, in Kowloon, and by 1936 Imperial Airways offered a flight from Hong Kong to Penang (in Malaya), from which passengers could eventually reach Britain.  +
Pan American Airways operated a flight to Manila, linking Hong Kong to San Francisco, while China National Airways Corporation connected the colony with the mainland.
通讯和交通的进步使香港与世界其他地区连接起来，并使这片殖民地成为热门旅游目的地。1920 年的一本英国旅游指南将香港描述为“远东游客最有趣的停靠港，因为它也是该地区最重要的商业和航运中心。” ³ 中国著名学者和改革家胡适回忆起 20 世纪 20 年代末的一次香港之旅，并坚称香港的夜景是世界上最美的之一。1928 年，九龙启德机场启用。到 1936 年，帝国航空开通了从香港飞往槟城（马来亚）的航班，乘客最终可以从槟城前往英国。泛美航空运营着飞往马尼拉的航班，将香港与旧金山连接起来，而中国航空公司则将香港与中国大陆连接起来。 +



Hong Kong was also attracting British writers fascinated by the colony “as an outpost of empire, a minute enclave enveloped by the vastness of China, an exotic entrepôt pulsating with life and adventure, yet paradoxically a speck of normality on the brink of a forbidding continent.”4 In The Painted Veil (1924), renowned novelist Somerset Maugham presented Hong Kong’s European community as a den of passion and scandal.  +
So scathing that colonial officials protested and the leading characters won a libel suit against Maugham, the novel later became a Hollywood film starring Greta Garbo.  +
In 1930, Putnam Weale, a less well-known but prolific author on China and Asia, wrote The Port of Fragrance, a fictional work that focused on the general strike of 1925–1926 but also dealt with the unhappy lives of bored European women in Hong Kong.  +
Stella Benson, who was married to a British official, wrote several books based on her experience in Hong Kong: The Poor Man (1923), The Little World (1925), and Mundos (1935).  +
Benson spent the last years of her life fighting child prostitution in Hong Kong by writing reports for the League of Nations.
香港也吸引着众多英国作家，他们被这片殖民地深深吸引：“它既是帝国的边陲，又是被广袤的中国包围的一小块飞地，既是充满活力和冒险的异域贸易中心，又是在令人望而生畏的大陆边缘的一抹寻常的宁静。” ⁴ 在著名小说家萨默塞特·毛姆的 《面纱》 （1924）中，他将香港的欧洲社群描绘成一个充满激情和丑闻的巢穴。这部小说笔锋犀利，引发了殖民官员的抗议，小说中的主人公甚至赢得了针对毛姆的诽谤诉讼。后来，这部小说被改编成好莱坞电影，由葛丽泰·嘉宝主演。1930 年，另一位著作颇丰的中国及亚洲作家普特南·威尔创作了小说《香港》 。这部小说以 1925-1926 年的香港大罢工为背景，同时也描写了在香港百无聊赖的欧洲女性的悲惨生活。嫁给英国官员的斯特拉·本森根据她在香港的经历写了好几本书： 《穷人》 （1923 年）、 《小世界》 （1925 年）和 《世界》 （1935 年）。本森晚年致力于打击香港的儿童卖淫问题，为国际联盟撰写报告。 +

CHINESE INDUSTRY AND BANKS
中国工业和银行业
Thanks to World War I and developments on the mainland, Chinese businessmen played an increasingly large role in Hong Kong’s modern economy during this period.  +
The war had diverted European business from Asia, allowing smaller Chinese firms to move in, while the chaos after the 1911 revolution in China brought an influx of wealthy Chinese entrepreneurs—especially during the general instability of the early 1920s, when Sun Yat-sen’s Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) in Canton was receiving help from Soviet advisors.  +
Chinese came from Guangdong in large numbers yearly until the Japan invasion in 1941.  +
The rising social and economic status of Hong Kong’s Chinese population was reflected in the number of Chinese moving to residential areas previously dominated by Europeans and in the growth of Chinese department stores, restaurants, and teahouses.
得益于第一次世界大战和中国大陆的发展，在此期间，中国商人在香港的现代经济中扮演着日益重要的角色。战争使欧洲的商业活动从亚洲转移，使得规模较小的中国企业得以迁入香港；而1911年辛亥革命后的混乱局面也带来了大量富裕的中国企业家涌入——尤其是在20世纪20年代初的整体动荡时期，当时孙中山领导的国民党在广州接受苏联顾问的援助。直到1941年日本入侵香港之前，每年都有大量华人从广东来到香港。香港华人社会和经济地位的提升体现在：越来越多的华人迁入此前以欧洲人为主的居住区，以及华人百货商店、餐馆和茶馆的蓬勃发展。 +



Most scholars have assumed that Hong Hong’s industrialization did not take off until the late 1940s, when entrepreneurs came from China to escape civil war and Communist rule.  +
In the late 1970s, however, scholar Frank Leeming argued that Hong Kong’s industry “did not arise transformed within a year or two in the late forties, but was already geared to transformation before the Second World War, on the basis of an industrial inheritance of expertise in labour and capital going back for a century.”5 Whereas colonial reports as late as the 1940s consistently underestimated the number of Chinese-owned factories in Hong Kong, reports by Chinese business groups showed that Hong Kong’s Chinese industry was much larger and more modernized.  +
The idea of Hong Kong having little industry persisted in colonial government publications until the 1960s, by which time Hong Kong had become well known for its industry.
大多数学者认为，香港的工业化直到 20 世纪 40 年代末才开始腾飞，当时许多企业家为了逃避内战和共产党的统治而从中国大陆来到香港。然而，在 20 世纪 70 年代末，学者弗兰克·利明（Frank Leeming）提出，香港的工业“并非在 40 年代末的一两年内突然转型，而是在二战前就已经具备了转型的条件，这得益于其一个世纪以来在劳动力和资本方面积累的工业经验。” ⁵ 尽管直到 20 世纪 40 年代，殖民地政府的报告仍然持续低估香港华人工厂的数量，但华人商业团体的报告显示，香港的华人工业规模更大，也更加现代化。直到 20 世纪 60 年代，香港工业薄弱的观念仍然在殖民地政府的出版物中流传，而此时香港的工业已经闻名遐迩。 +



There is much evidence to support Leeming’s claim.  +
In 1881, Governor John Hennessy reported a wide range of industries run by local Chinese, including boat building, glass-making, and rope-making.  +
In the early 1900s, Chinese entrepreneurs tried vigorously to compete with foreign industries.  +
The Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company had a factory in Hong Kong that produced cigarettes to compete with the British American Tobacco Company.  +
In 1912, a group of Chinese businessmen opened the Kwong Sang Hong, which produced cosmetics, perfumes, and soaps.  +
After World War I, Chinese capitalists began to turn parts of Kowloon into factories for producing flashlights, batteries, and underwear.  +
Hong Kong’s industries were so developed that by the 1930s local exports were holding their own in the international market.  +
Goods of all kinds—from automobile parts to salt, hemp, and burlap—were exported to China and across Southeast Asia.  +
Pharmaceutical factories founded in the late 1910s and early 1920s exported their products to China and worldwide.  +
Other important industries included dyeing, knitting, and fireworks.  +
In 1939, Labour Officer H.  +
R.  +
Butters noted that while most of the heavy industry such as docks and cement works were owned and managed by Europeans, most of the recently founded companies and factories were “purely Chinese.”6
有大量证据支持李明的说法。1881 年，总督约翰·亨尼西报告称，当地华人经营着众多产业，包括造船、玻璃制造和绳索制造。20 世纪初，华人企业家积极与外国产业竞争。南洋兄弟烟草公司在香港设有工厂，生产香烟，与英美烟草公司展开竞争。1912 年，一群华人商人创办了广生行，生产化妆品、香水和肥皂。第一次世界大战后，华人资本家开始将九龙部分地区改造成工厂，生产手电筒、电池和内衣。香港的工业发展如此迅速，以至于到了 20 世纪 30 年代，本地出口产品在国际市场上占据了一席之地。从汽车零件到盐、麻和粗麻布，各种商品都出口到中国和东南亚各地。 1910 年代末至 1920 年代初建立的制药厂将其产品出口到中国和世界各地。其他重要产业包括染色、针织和烟花。1939 年，劳工官员 H.R.  +
Butters 指出，虽然大多数重工业，例如码头和水泥厂，都由欧洲人拥有和管理，但大多数新成立的公司和工厂都是“纯粹的中国人”。 6 +
The reason that the colonial government consistently played down Hong Kong’s industry says much about Hong Kong’s historical purpose in the British Empire.  +
As political scientist Tak-Wing Ngo argues, the official colonial account of Hong Kong’s industry as not beginning until after 1949 ignores any “activities not sanctioned by the ruling authorities,” such as industrial development by Chinese entrepreneurs, while focusing on the China trade under British merchants.7 Fearing that colonial imports would compete with British goods, until the 1930s the British government discouraged colonial governments from promoting industry.  +
Large British firms, which had little interest in industry, enjoyed considerable influence in Hong Kong’s legislative and executive councils as well as in the British Parliament.  +
Thus, even though Hong Kong’s industries were highly developed before 1949 and Chinese industry was the largest employer in the colony, the colonial government maintained that Hong Kong’s economic success was due to the China trade.  +
An economic commission formed in 1934 by Governor William Peel (and including representatives from all the major British firms) to study the local effects of the Great Depression concluded that Hong Kong’s economy still depended primarily on the China trade rather than on industry.  +
Yet by this time Hong Kong-made goods such as cosmetics and leatherware had replaced imports, while locally made flashlights took over the Southeast Asian market that had previously been dominated by British and Japanese firms.  +
British officials complained about cheap imports from Hong Kong, prompting the British and Canadian governments to impose tariffs.
殖民政府一再淡化香港工业的重要性，这在很大程度上反映了香港在英国殖民帝国中的历史地位。正如政治学家吴德荣所言，官方殖民政府将香港工业的兴起归结为 1949 年之后才开始，这种说法忽略了所有“未经统治当局批准的活动”，例如中国企业家的工业发展，而只关注英国商人主导的对华贸易。 7 由于担心殖民地进口商品会与英国商品竞争，英国政府直到 20 世纪 30 年代都一直阻止殖民地政府发展工业。对工业兴趣寥寥的英国大型企业在香港立法会、行政会议以及英国议会中都拥有相当大的影响力。因此，尽管香港的工业在 1949 年之前就已经高度发达，而且中国企业是殖民地最大的雇主，但殖民政府仍然坚持认为香港的经济成功归功于对华贸易。 1934 年，港督威廉·皮尔成立了一个经济委员会（成员包括所有英国主要公司的代表），旨在研究大萧条对香港的影响。该委员会得出结论，香港经济仍然主要依赖对华贸易，而非工业。然而，此时香港制造的商品，例如化妆品和皮革制品，已经取代了进口商品，而本地制造的手电筒则占据了此前由英国和日本公司主导的东南亚市场。英国官员抱怨香港的廉价进口商品，促使英国和加拿大政府征收关税。 +



The steady growth of Chinese industry both helped and benefited from the growth of Chinese banks in Hong Kong.  +
Before 1919, the colony had two main types of banks: large Western banks and smaller Chinese banks.  +
For most Chinese in Hong Kong, writes Elizabeth Sinn, “foreign banks were irrelevant.” The main source of credit was the small banks in the Western District, the center of Chinese business.  +
While these banks were much more in touch with the needs of local business, they were risky ventures based mainly on the reputation of the proprietor or a few partners.  +
Interest rates were high, loan periods short.  +
The banks could not meet many of the demands for modern business, such as checking accounts, bills of exchange, or letters of credit.  +
By the early twentieth century, there was a “gaping chasm between modern foreign banks and native Chinese banks.” Astute Chinese entrepreneurs saw that the “market was ripe for banks which could offer all the modern facilities and, at the same time, be attuned to Chinese business culture.”8 The Bank of East Asia, established in 1919, was the first public Chinese-capitalized bank traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  +
The bank’s directors were among the most influential Chinese men in Hong Kong, with huge commercial interests in China, Japan, Indonesia, Indochina, and elsewhere in East Asia.
中国工业的稳步发展既促进了香港华人银行业的发展，也从中受益。1919 年以前，香港主要有两种类型的银行：大型西方银行和小型华人银行。伊丽莎白·辛恩写道，对大多数在港华人来说，“外国银行无关紧要”。主要的信贷来源是位于华人商业中心西区的小型银行。虽然这些银行更了解本地企业的需求，但它们风险很高，主要依赖于所有者或少数合伙人的声誉。利率高，贷款期限短。这些银行无法满足现代商业的许多需求，例如支票账户、汇票或信用证。到 20 世纪初，“现代外国银行和本土华人银行之间出现了巨大的鸿沟”。精明的华人企业家意识到，“市场需要能够提供所有现代化设施，同时又能适应中国商业文化的银行。” 8.  +
东亚银行成立于 1919 年，是第一家在香港联合交易所上市的华人资本银行。该银行的董事是当时香港最有影响力的华人人士，他们在中国、日本、印度尼西亚、印度支那以及东亚其他地区拥有巨大的商业利益。 +

CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
宪法发展
The rise of Chinese commercial power and influence helps explain some of the constitutional developments of the interwar period.  +
In the 1910s and early 1920s, demands arose for political representation and more control over the colony’s finances.  +
None of these movements, orchestrated mainly by Europeans, succeeded.  +
The Colonial Office rejected a petition for constitutional reform in 1916, and little resulted from the short-lived Constitutional Reform Association, founded in May 1917 and dismissed by Governor Reginald Stubbs in 1920 as a “farcical body.”9 In 1919 a group of residents, mainly British and some of them unofficial members of the Legislative Council, pushed for more representation.  +
Neither Governor Francis May nor the home government approved of the demands.  +
Another political organization, the Kowloon Residents’ Association formed by a group of Europeans in 1921, pressed for more roads and public works in Kowloon as well as for a European reserve similar to that on Victoria Peak.  +
In 1922, Governor Stubbs rejected another petition for representation as coming from “a numerically insignificant transitory European population.”10
中国商业实力和影响力的崛起有助于解释两次世界大战期间的一些宪政发展。在 20 世纪 10 年代和 20 年代初，人们要求获得政治代表权和更多对殖民地财政的控制权。这些主要由欧洲人策划的运动均未成功。殖民地事务部于 1916 年驳回了一项宪政改革请愿，而成立于 1917 年 5 月的宪政改革协会也昙花一现，于 1920 年被总督雷金纳德·斯塔布斯斥为“滑稽的机构”。 1919 年，一群居民（主要是英国人，其中一些是立法会的非正式成员）推动增加代表权。总督弗朗西斯·梅和英国政府均未批准这些要求。另一个政治组织——由一群欧洲人于 1921 年成立的九龙居民协会——则要求在九龙修建更多道路和公共工程，并建立一个类似于太平山顶的欧洲人保留地。 1922 年，斯塔布斯州长驳回了另一份要求获得代表权的请愿书，理由是该请愿书来自“人数微不足道的欧洲过境人口”。 10 +
As earlier, the Colonial Office resisted demands for constitutional reform because it distrusted the local European business community.  +
The Colonial Office also feared that giving in to such demands would encourage wealthy Chinese to make similar demands.  +
In 1923, Stubbs explained that giving voting rights to Europeans or Eurasians would lead to demands for the same from the Chinese in Hong Kong.  +
The British government opposed constitutional reform in Hong Kong for another reason.  +
The colony, explains historian John Darwin, was “merely one square on the larger chessboard of Anglo-Chinese relations.”11 In the 1920s, the British government became even more insistent on this policy.  +
For example, in 1922 the Foreign Office criticized Stubbs for trying to forge better relations with the left-wing government in Canton, arguing that Stubbs had violated the official British policy of encouraging Chinese unity.  +
Similarly, in the late 1920s the Foreign Office rejected Governor Cecil Clementi’s proposal to formally convert the leased New Territories, maintaining that it violated British policy of conciliating Chinese nationalism.
与以往一样，殖民地事务部抵制宪政改革的要求，因为它不信任当地的欧洲商界。殖民地事务部还担心，如果屈服于这些要求，会鼓励富裕的华人提出类似的要求。1923 年，司徒生解释说，赋予欧洲人或欧亚混血儿投票权会导致香港华人提出同样的要求。英国政府反对香港宪政改革还有另一个原因。历史学家约翰·达尔文解释说，这片殖民地“只不过是英中关系这盘大棋盘上的一格棋子”。 11 到了 20 世纪 20 年代，英国政府更加坚持这一政策。例如，1922 年，外交部批评司徒生试图与广州左翼政府建立更好的关系，认为司徒生违反了英国鼓励中国统一的官方政策。同样，在 20 世纪 20 年代末，外交部拒绝了总督塞西尔·克莱门蒂正式将租借的新界改为英国领土的提议，认为这违反了英国安抚中国民族主义的政策。 +



Several significant constitutional reforms did, however, take place during the interwar period.  +
In May 1926, Clementi shocked the Colonial Office by proposing to nominate a Chinese, Chow Shouson, to the Executive Council.  +
Chow, a prominent merchant and community leader who had attended Columbia University in the 1870s as one of the first Chinese to study in the West and subsequently distinguished himself in the Qing government, remained on the council until 1936, when he was replaced by Robert Kotewall, a Eurasian businessman.  +
In 1928, the Colonial Office accepted Clementi’s proposal to expand the Legislative Council by two official and two nonofficial members.  +
However, Clementi dashed the British businessmen’s hopes for increased representation by selecting a Chinese physician, Tso Seen Wan, and a Portuguese merchant, Jose Pedro Braga, the first Portuguese appointed to the council.
然而，两次世界大战期间也进行了一些重要的宪政改革。1926年5月，克莱门蒂提议提名华人周寿顺进入行政会议，此举震惊了殖民地事务部。周寿顺是一位杰出的商人和社区领袖，他于19世纪70年代就读于哥伦比亚大学，是最早赴西方留学的华人之一，之后在清政府中崭露头角。他一直担任行政会议成员至1936年，之后由欧亚混血商人罗伯特·科特沃尔接任。1928年，殖民地事务部接受了克莱门蒂的提议，将立法会议的席位增加两名官方成员和两名非官方成员。然而，克莱门蒂却让英国商人希望增加代表权的愿望落空，他选择了华人医生曹善婉和葡萄牙商人何塞·佩德罗·布拉加，后者是首位被任命为立法会议成员的葡萄牙人。 +



STRIKES AND BOYCOTTS  罢工和抵制
More than anything else, interwar Hong Kong was characterized by strikes and boycotts.  +
Although World War I had not greatly affected Hong Kong, the aftermath of the war did.  +
Having sent more than two hundred thousand laborers to Europe during the war, China hoped to regain control of the German concessions in Shandong.  +
Instead, the victorious Allied powers gave the German concessions to Japan as part of a secret deal made during the war.  +
The Treaty of Versailles had been inspired by American president Woodrow Wilson’s calls for open diplomacy and self-determination, but the settlement convinced many Chinese that such talk was a sham.  +
When news of the settlement reached Beijing, university students held a mass demonstration in Tiananmen Square on May 4, 1919.  +
Part of what became known as the May Fourth Movement, the demonstrations in Beijing spread like wildfire to other cities and led to a massive boycott of Japanese goods.  +
In Hong Kong, students and journalists organized anti-Japanese demonstrations, while merchants led a boycott of Japanese goods and urged local Chinese to buy only Chinese goods.  +
World War I showed the barbarism of the West and led colonized people around the world to question the legitimacy of colonialism, while the Treaty of Versailles ending the war and prompting the May Fourth demonstrations stimulated the growth of revolutionary nationalism.  +
Influenced by the rise of Chinese nationalism and by workers’ movements in China and around the globe, labor consciousness in Hong Kong soared.
两次世界大战之间的香港，罢工和抵制活动比任何其他事件都更为显著。尽管第一次世界大战本身对香港的影响并不大，但战后的局势却影响深远。战争期间，中国向欧洲输送了超过20万劳工，并希望能够重新夺回德租界山东的控制权。然而，战胜的协约国却将这些租界割让给了日本，作为战时秘密协议的一部分。凡尔赛条约的签订源于美国总统伍德罗·威尔逊关于公开外交和民族自决的呼吁，但这一安排却让许多中国人相信，这些言论不过是空谈。当这一消息传到北京后，大学生们于1919年5月4日在天安门广场举行了大规模示威游行。这场后来被称为“五四运动”的示威活动迅速蔓延到其他城市，并引发了大规模的抵制日货运动。在香港，学生和记者组织了反日示威游行，而商人们则带头抵制日货，并呼吁当地华人只购买中国商品。第一次世界大战暴露了西方的野蛮行径，促使世界各地的被殖民人民质疑殖民主义的合法性；而结束战争的《凡尔赛条约》以及由此引发的五四运动，则刺激了革命民族主义的发展。受中国民族主义兴起以及中国乃至全球工人运动的影响，香港的劳工意识也随之高涨。 +



The Mechanics’ Strike of 1920
1920年的机械工人罢工
The mechanics’ strike of spring 1920 was the first strike in Hong Kong organized by a labor union, the Chinese Mechanics Institute.  +
The union demanded a 40 percent increase in wages.  +
Although the Hong Kong dollar had depreciated by 50 percent since the outbreak of World War I and prices had risen significantly, Chinese workers’ wages were no higher than before the war.  +
(European workers, who already enjoyed higher wages than Chinese workers, had received increases of around 15 percent.) Rice had been sent to Europe in 1919 to relieve food shortages there, leading to such severe shortages and price increases in Hong Kong that the government had to impose price limits.  +
To support their demands, the Chinese Mechanics Institute enlisted the services of Lo Man Kam, a prominent Eurasian lawyer.  +
After employers—mainly the dockyards, electric companies, and the government itself—turned down four requests, the workers went on strike on March 31.  +
Within a week, almost ten thousand workers were on strike, bringing Hong Kong’s economy to a standstill.  +
Many of the strikers went to Canton, where they were supported by Sun Yat-sen’s government and local labor unions.  +
Although most people in Hong Kong, including many Europeans, considered the workers’ demands justified, the employers refused to yield.  +
The strike lasted for more than three weeks, and only after pressure from Secretary for Chinese Affairs E.  +
R.  +
Hallifax did the employers eventually concede to a 32.5 percent pay increase for the workers.
1920年春季的技工罢工是香港历史上首次由工会——中国技工学会——组织的罢工。该工会要求加薪40%。尽管自第一次世界大战爆发以来港元贬值了50%，物价也大幅上涨，但中国工人的工资却与战前持平。（欧洲工人的工资本来就高于中国工人，战后又获得了约15%的涨幅。）1919年，为了缓解欧洲的粮食短缺，香港曾向欧洲运送大米，导致当地粮食严重短缺，价格飞涨，政府不得不实施价格限制。为了支持他们的诉求，中国技工学会聘请了著名的欧亚混血律师罗文锦。在雇主——主要是船坞、电力公司以及政府本身——四次拒绝了他们的要求后，工人们于3月31日开始罢工。短短一周内，近万名工人加入罢工，香港经济陷入瘫痪。许多罢工者前往广州，在那里他们得到了孙中山政府和当地工会的支持。尽管包括许多欧洲人在内的大多数香港人都认为工人的要求是合理的，但雇主拒绝让步。罢工持续了三个多星期，最终在国务卿贺力法施压下，雇主才同意给工人加薪32.5%。 +



The 1920 strike was mainly economic, but it had important ramifications beyond the economic realm.  +
A victory for organized labor, the strike showed how workers had learned the importance of organizing—more than one hundred unions were formed in 1920 alone—and how to use strikes for collective bargaining.  +
The strike also revealed how organizations such as the Tung Wah Hospital were no longer able to mediate between the Chinese working classes and the colonial government.  +
By this time, organized workers had the power to deal directly with their employers.  +
The government, which had been completely unprepared for a labor union to gain so much power, subsequently took a more proactive role in managing Chinese guilds, unions, and other associations.  +
The Societies Ordinance of 1920 prohibited any society having “unlawful purposes or purposes incompatible with the peace and good order of the Colony.” While the ordinance banned triad groups, it also banned a dozen considerably less controversial groups—including the Hotel Boys and Cook Guild, the Knitters’ Union, the Christian Youth Groups, and the Barbers’ Union.  +
Finally, the strike affected workers in neighboring Canton, who subsequently went on their own strike and obtained better wages.  +
In 1921 alone, workers there organized successful strikes in every major industry.
1920年的罢工主要是一场经济运动，但其影响远不止于经济领域。这场罢工是劳工组织的胜利，它表明工人们已经认识到组织起来的重要性——仅1920年一年就成立了一百多个工会——以及如何利用罢工进行集体谈判。罢工也揭示了像东华医院这样的组织已无法再在华工阶级和殖民政府之间进行调解。此时，有组织的工人已经拥有了直接与雇主谈判的权力。政府对工会获得如此大的权力毫无准备，随后开始更加积极地管理华人行会、工会和其他社团。1920年的《社团条例》禁止任何“目的非法或与殖民地和平与良好秩序不符”的社团成立。虽然该法令取缔了三合会组织，但也取缔了十几个争议较小的团体，包括酒店男工和厨师协会、针织工会、基督教青年团体以及理发师工会。最终，罢工波及到邻近的坎顿市，当地工人随后也举行了罢工，并争取到了更高的工资。仅在1921年，坎顿市的工人就在各大行业组织了多次成功的罢工。 +



The Seamen’s Strike of 1922
1922年海员罢工
Organized by the Chinese Seamen’s Union, the seamen’s strike of January-March 1922 began as a strike by about fifteen hundred workers.  +
Under the leadership of three seamen—Su Zhaozheng, Lin Weimin, and Chen Bingsheng—the strikers demanded wage increases of 30–40 percent to match the rises in the cost of living and that seamen be hired through the union rather than through compradors.  +
By the end of January, more than ten thousand seamen had left for Canton, where the cost of living was lower and where they were welcomed by the mayor, Sun Fo, son of Sun Yat-sen.  +
Although Chinese merchants asked the Tung Wah Hospital and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to mediate, the negotiations soon broke down.
由中国海员联合会组织的1922年1月至3月海员大罢​​工，最初约有1500名工人参与。在苏兆正、林维民和陈炳生三位海员的领导下，罢工者要求工资上涨30%至40%，以应对生活成本的上涨，并要求通过工会而非买办雇佣海员。到1月底，超过1万名海员前往生活成本较低的广州，并受到时任广州市长孙中山之子孙佛的欢迎。尽管中国商人请求东华医院和中华总商会进行调解，但谈判很快破裂。 +



Lasting more than fifty days, the seamen’s strike was the “first real demonstration in Hong Kong of the strength of the Chinese worker.”12 When servants, clerks, waiters, and tram conductors all left their jobs, the privileged European and Chinese communities found themselves helpless.  +
Although any initial sympathy for the strikers eventually evaporated, for many Europeans the strike was a sobering experience.  +
“It will have done some good,” an English-language newspaper argued, “if it teaches us that we are living in a wholly different world from that which existed before the war.”13 The colonial government enlisted the support of Chinese and Eurasian community leaders such as Chow Shouson, Lau Chu Pak, Robert Ho Tung, and Robert Kotewall, but these elites seemed more concerned about preventing labor unions from taking over their leadership of the Chinese community than with mediating.  +
Lau Chu Pak and Chow Shouson, the two Chinese unofficial members of the Legislative Council, insisted that the strike was political rather than economic and was inspired by “Bolshevism.” The two denounced the strikers as selfish and ignorant, insisting that the colonial government ban all unions and not “retreat one inch.”14
这场持续五十多天的海员罢工是“香港第一次真正展现中国工人力量的行动”。 12 当仆人、职员、服务员和电车售票员纷纷辞职时，享有特权的欧洲人和华人社区发现自己束手无策。尽管最初对罢工者的同情最终消散殆尽，但对许多欧洲人来说，这次罢工是一次令人警醒的经历。“如果它能让我们意识到，我们生活在一个与战前截然不同的世界，”一家英文报纸评论道，“那它就起到了一定的作用。” 13 殖民政府争取到了周寿臣、刘竹柏、何东和罗伯特·科特沃尔等华人及欧亚裔社区领袖的支持，但这些精英似乎更关心的是阻止工会接管他们对华人社区的领导权，而不是进行调解。刘竹柏和周寿臣这两位立法会的华人非正式议员坚称，这次罢工是政治性的而非经济性的，并且受到了“布尔什维克主义”的启发。两人谴责罢工者自私无知，坚持要求殖民政府取缔所有工会，并且“寸步不让”。 14 +
Colonial authorities, Chinese elites, and the European community blamed the strike on left-wing agitators in China, who have historically taken credit for this “first angry wave” of labor struggles.  +
But the seamen always insisted that the strike was economic and not political (although this was a common justification for strikes, in Hong Kong and elsewhere, and Su Zhaozheng and Lin Weimin later joined the Chinese Communist Party).  +
Governor Stubbs mismanaged the strike by overreacting and insisting that it was political and led by agitators in Canton.  +
When the seamen’s union posted armed pickets along the coast and seized food from trains on the Canton-Kowloon Railway, on February 1 Stubbs banned the union as “an unlawful society” that was being “used for purposes incompatible with the peace and good order of the Colony.” After colonial police arrested some of the union leaders, closed down the union headquarters, and pulled down its signboard, written in the calligraphy of Sun Yat-sen, the union responded by beckoning all workers in Hong Kong to strike and leave for Canton.  +
More than one hundred thousand additional workers heeded the call, including the entire staff at Government House.  +
The Legislative Council retaliated by passing the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, which prohibited posters and public gatherings and authorized wide police powers for censoring mail and conducting random body searches.  +
After Stubbs stopped train service to Canton, on March 4 colonial police shot dead five workers and wounded eight more trying to leave on foot through Sha Tin, in the New Territories.
殖民当局、中国精英和欧洲社会将罢工归咎于中国左翼煽动者，历史上，这些人一直声称对这场“第一波愤怒浪潮”的劳工斗争负有责任。但海员们始终坚称罢工是经济性的，而非政治性的（尽管在香港和其他地方，这都是罢工的常见理由，苏兆正和林维民后来也加入了中国共产党）。总督司徒勃对罢工处理不当，反应过度，并坚持认为罢工是政治性的，是由广州的煽动者领导的。当海员工会在沿海地区设立武装纠察队，并在广九铁路上扣押火车上的食物时，司徒勃于2月1日以“非法社团”的名义取缔了该工会，称其“被用于与殖民地和平与良好秩序不符的目的”。殖民地警察逮捕了一些工会领袖，关闭了工会总部，并拆除了用孙中山先生书法书写的工会招牌。工会随即号召香港所有工人罢工并前往广州。超过十万名工人响应了这一号召，其中包括政府大厦的全体工作人员。立法会随即通过了《紧急规例条例》，禁止张贴海报和举行公众集会，并授权警方拥有广泛的权力，可以审查邮件和进行随机搜查。司徒拔下火车后，3月4日，殖民地警察在沙田枪杀了五名试图步行离开香港的工人，并打伤了八名工人。 +



As historian Ming Chan argues, the colonial government’s measures helped to transform the strike “from an economic strike into an all-out political confrontation between British colonial might and Chinese patriotic pride and national interests.”15 Following extensive negotiations among the seamen, the shipping companies, and the Canton and Hong Kong governments, the workers won a settlement close to what they had demanded.  +
The colonial government agreed to lift the ban on the Seamen’s Union, release the arrested leaders, and pay compensation to the victims of the shootings in the New Territories.  +
The end of the strike on March 7 resulted “in a total victory for the Chinese seamen but complete capitulation of the British establishment, with its dignity and prestige in shambles.”16 As part of the strike settlement, Stubbs had to rescind his ban on the Seamen’s Union, while the same policeman who had pulled down the union’s signboard had to put it back up.  +
The strike also showed that the Chinese workers had become a class of their own, no longer relying on the Chinese merchant elite for support.  +
More strikes occurred in 1922, although few were as successful as the seamen’s strike.
正如历史学家陈明所论证的那样，殖民政府的措施促使罢工“从一场经济罢工演变为英国殖民强权与中国爱国主义和国家利益之间的全面政治对抗”。 15 经过海员、航运公司以及广州和香港政府的广泛谈判，工人们最终达成了一项接近他们要求的协议。殖民政府同意解除对海员联合会的禁令，释放被捕的领导人，并向新界枪击事件的受害者支付赔偿金。3 月 7 日罢工的结束“对中国海员来说是一场彻底的胜利，但对英国统治集团来说却是彻底的投降，其尊严和威望荡然无存”。 16 作为罢工协议的一部分，司徒勃不得不撤销对海员联合会的禁令，而之前扯下联合会标牌的警察也必须将其重新竖起。这次罢工也表明，中国工人已经形成了一个独立的阶级，不再依赖中国商人精英的支持。1922 年还发生了更多罢工，但鲜有像海员罢工那样成功的。 +



The Strike-Boycott of 1925–1926
1925-1926年的罢工抵制运动
The most significant event of the interwar period was the strike-boycott of 1925–1926, which showed how the revolutionary nationalist movements in China could affect Hong Kong.  +
On May 30, 1925, Sikh police under British command opened fire on a crowd of Chinese demonstrators in the International Settlement of Shanghai.  +
At least 9 demonstrators were killed, and many others were wounded.  +
News of this so-called May Thirtieth Incident spread like wildfire, prompting protests all across China but especially in the two cities where British interests were most heavily concentrated, Shanghai and Canton.  +
On June 23, during a particularly heated demonstration in Shamian (known to Europeans as Shameen), the British and French concession in Canton, troops under foreign command killed more than 50 Chinese protesters and wounded almost 120 more.  +
As news of the massacre spread, labor and union leaders in Canton called for a general strike in southern China—especially in Hong Kong, the most visible example of British imperialism.  +
Kuomintang leaders and their Soviet advisors even considered attacking the International Settlement in Shamian.  +
Anti-British pamphlets and placards in Hong Kong implored Chinese to rise up and drive out the British colonialists and their Chinese “hunting dogs.” Strike leaders in Canton called on all Chinese to leave Hong Kong, spreading rumors that the colonial government planned to poison the colony’s water supplies and offering free passage to Canton by train or steamer.
两次世界大战之间最重要的事件是1925-1926年的罢工抵制运动，它展现了中国革命民族主义运动如何影响香港。1925年5月30日，受英国指挥的锡克教警察在上海公共租界向一群中国示威者开枪。至少9名示威者被杀，多人受伤。这一被称为“五三十事件”的消息迅速传开，引发了中国各地的抗议活动，尤其是在英国利益最为集中的两个城市——上海和广州。6月23日，在广州沙面（欧洲人称之为沙敏）——英法租界——的一次特别激烈的示威活动中，外国军队杀害了50多名中国示威者，并造成近120人受伤。随着屠杀事件的蔓延，广州的劳工和工会领袖呼吁在华南地区——尤其是在英国帝国主义最显眼的香港——举行总罢工。国民党领导人及其苏联顾问甚至考虑过袭击沙面公共租界。香港的反英传单和标语呼吁中国人奋起反抗，驱逐英国殖民者及其中国“猎犬”。广州的罢工领袖号召所有中国人离开香港，散布谣言称殖民政府计划毒害香港的水源，并承诺提供免费的火车或轮船前往广州。 +



In the first two weeks after the massacre in Shamian, more than 50,000 Chinese left Hong Kong in protest.  +
Food prices soared, prompting a run on banks.  +
Hong Kong’s economy nearly came to a halt, and by early July the colony was “like a ghost town.”17 Pickets in Canton prevented strikers from returning to Hong Kong.  +
On July 10, Stubbs wrote that “all regular trades are practically at a standstill.” The police had been deporting vagabonds and other “undesirables.”18 By the end of July, some 250,000 Chinese had left for Canton.  +
On September 18, Stubbs described the colony’s financial situation as “most serious.”19 One prominent Chinese bank had already gone into liquidation, other firms were on the verge of bankruptcy, and Stubbs feared that more would follow suit.  +
The Chinese Chamber of Commerce had asked for a trade loan from the British government.  +
Although the worst was over by early 1926, the strike lasted for more than a year, and the British government had to provide a trade loan of three million pounds to prevent the colony’s economy from collapsing.  +
And even after the strike itself ended, the accompanying boycott against British goods, which helped make the strike so devastating, lasted for several more months.
沙面惨案发生后的头两周，超过五万名中国人离开香港以示抗议。食品价格飙升，引发银行挤兑。香港经济几乎停滞，到七月初，这座殖民地“宛如一座鬼城”。 17 广州的纠察队阻止了罢工者返回香港。7 月 10 日，斯塔布斯写道：“所有正规行业实际上都处于停滞状态。” 警察一直在驱逐流浪汉和其他“不受欢迎的人”。18 到 7 月底 ，约有 25 万华人前往广州。9 月 18 日，斯塔布斯形容香港的财政状况“极其严峻”。19 一家著名的华人银行已经破产清算，其他公司也濒临破产，斯塔布斯担心会有更多公司步其后尘。中华总商会已向英国政府申请贸易贷款。尽管最糟糕的时期在 1926 年初已经过去，但罢工持续了一年多，英国政府不得不提供 300 万英镑的贸易贷款，以防止香港经济崩溃。即使罢工本身结束后，随之而来的抵制英国商品的运动（这使得罢工造成了如此巨大的破坏）又持续了几个月。 +



Governor Stubbs and his successor, Clementi, were adamant that the strike was directed by Bolshevik agitators in Canton and their Soviet advisors and had nothing to do with economic or political conditions in the colony.  +
Stubbs in particular has often been criticized for not understanding the political situation in China and for failing to differentiate between Chinese nationalism and Communism, but he was not necessarily exaggerating the extent of these influences from Canton.  +
Even before the strike, left-wing intellectuals and union organizers had tried to encourage nationalist sympathies in Hong Kong by distributing handbills urging workers to strike.  +
Nor were Stubbs and Clementi exaggerating the importance of funding from outside the colony.  +
The bulk of the financial support came from the revolutionary Kuomintang government in Canton, with other funds coming from overseas Chinese, Russian workers, and an anonymous British trade union.  +
And the colonial government had another reason to convince the British government that the strike had nothing to do with conditions in Hong Kong or with the Chinese business community: many people in Britain believed that the strike represented a just revolt of workers against conditions that had long been abolished in England and were unsympathetic toward the European expatriates in Hong Kong.
总督司徒志及其继任者金文泰坚称，罢工是由广州的布尔什维克煽动者及其苏联顾问策划的，与香港的经济或政治状况毫无关系。司徒志尤其常因不了解中国的政治局势，以及未能区分中国民族主义和共产主义而受到批评，但他未必夸大了广州的影响程度。早在罢工之前，左翼知识分子和工会组织者就已试图通过散发传单，敦促工人罢工，从而在香港煽动民族主义情绪。司徒志和金文泰也并未夸大来自殖民地以外资金的重要性。大部分资金来自广州的国民党革命政府，其他资金则来自海外华人、俄国工人以及一个匿名的英国工会。殖民政府还有另一个理由来说服英国政府，罢工与香港的状况或中国商界无关：许多英国人认为，罢工代表着工人对英国早已废除的、对在香港的欧洲侨民缺乏同情心的状况的正义反抗。 +



Why did the strike become so powerful? Although it was sparked by events in China, the strike derived part of its local force from genuine economic concerns and from the popular feeling against the privileged status of foreigners.  +
This was apparent from the demands of the strike commission, which apart from standard issues—such as an eight-hour workday, the abolition of contract and child labor, freedom of speech and press, the right to organize, and reductions in rent—also had a strong local component: that labor unions be allowed to vote for a Chinese member on the Legislative Council and that Chinese be treated as the equal of Europeans and be able to live on the Peak.  +
Second, although many Chinese left Hong Kong for Canton to show their nationalism and patriotism, others left because they were pressured to do so, while those who tried to return to Hong Kong could not.  +
In early February 1926, Clementi reported that the strike pickets had intensified their aggression against Hong Kong.  +
They were shooting at Indian troops on the Hong Kong side of the border and at police launches in the Shenzhen River between Hong Kong and China, blocking trains to and from China, and preventing villagers from crossing back into Hong Kong.  +
And in Guangdong, the general strike was limited mainly to the city of Canton and its environs.  +
Although many of the rural counties along the Guangdong-Hong Kong border supported the strike-boycott, peasants often resisted the boycott and its restrictions against selling crops and fish to Hong Kong.
这场罢工为何如此声势浩大？尽管其导火索是中国发生的事件，但其在香港的影响力部分源于民众对经济的切实关切以及对外国人特权的强烈不满。这一点从罢工委员会的诉求中可见一斑。除了八小时工作制、废除契约劳工和童工、言论和出版自由、组织权以及降低租金等常规诉求外，这些诉求还包含强烈的本地化内容：允许工会投票选举一名华人议员进入立法会，以及华人应享有与欧洲人平等的待遇，并获准居住在太平山顶。其次，虽然许多华人离开香港前往广州是为了表达他们的民族主义和爱国情怀，但也有一些人是迫于压力离开的，而那些试图返回香港的人则无法返回。1926年2月初，克莱门蒂报告称，罢工纠察队加大了对香港的攻击力度。他们向香港一侧的印度军队开火，并向香港与中国大陆之间深圳河上的警察巡逻艇开火，封锁往返中国大陆的火车，阻止村民返回香港。在广东，总罢工主要局限于广州市及其周边地区。尽管粤港边境的许多农村县都支持罢工抵制，但农民们往往抵制抵制及其对向香港出售农作物和鱼类的限制。 +



Having anticipated such a strike ever since the seamen’s strike of 1922, the colonial government had taken precautions by increasing the garrison, improving intelligence gathering, and building supply depots for coal.  +
Although Stubbs inflamed local tensions by overreacting rather than trying to understand the cause of the strike, the emergency measures that he passed may have prevented the strike from expanding.  +
Under the Peace Preservation Ordinance and the Emergency Ordinance that had been enacted during the 1922 strike, Stubbs declared a state of emergency, mobilizing volunteers and prohibiting the export of foodstuffs and money.  +
Stubbs also granted Chinese bankers their request for a moratorium on Chinese banks.  +
He limited the amount of currency that could be taken out of the colony, dispatched policemen to guard water supplies, sent troops to operate the Star Ferry and patrol the streets, closed schools early for summer vacation, and imposed a curfew.  +
He also ordered the main Chinese and European department stores to remain open for at least four hours per day.  +
In July, he authorized all Chinese mail and telegrams to be censored.  +
He also ordered the secretary for Chinese affairs to examine and censor all Chinese newspapers.  +
Three workers in shifts from dawn to dusk worked to remove any seditious or prostrike material, and no group related to the strike was allowed to place advertisements in the newspapers.  +
Stubbs also tried to use public and private funds to assist Chinese antirevolutionary forces in Canton and to persuade the Foreign Office to bribe the Beijing government into wiping out the revolutionary government in Canton.
自1922年海员罢工以来，殖民政府就预料到会发生类似的罢工，并采取了预防措施，包括增加驻军、加强情报收集以及修建煤炭供应站。尽管斯塔布斯反应过度，没有试图了解罢工的起因，反而加剧了当地的紧张局势，但他颁布的紧急措施或许阻止了罢工的蔓延。根据1922年罢工期间颁布的《维护和平条例》和《紧急状态条例》，斯塔布斯宣布进入紧急状态，动员志愿者并禁止食品和货币出口。斯塔布斯还批准了华人银行家提出的暂停营业的请求。他限制了可以带出殖民地的货币数量，派遣警察守卫供水系统，派兵运营天星小轮并巡逻街道，提前放暑假，并实施宵禁。他还命令主要的华人百货商店和欧洲百货商店每天至少营业四个小时。 7月，他下令审查所有中国邮件和电报。他还命令中国事务秘书审查所有中文报纸。三名工人从早到晚轮班工作，清除任何煽动性或支持罢工的材料，任何与罢工有关的团体都不得在报纸上刊登广告。斯塔布斯还试图利用公共和私人资金援助广州的中国反革命势力，并试图说服外交部贿赂北京政府，以铲除广州革命政府。 +



The Chinese and foreign communities assisted the government during the strike.  +
Volunteers worked at hospitals and drove the trams.  +
Tung Wah Hospital Committee members operated food stalls and sold food at low prices, while many Chinese and Eurasians joined the Volunteers, the Special Police Reserve, and the St.  +
John’s Ambulance Service.  +
Tso Seen Wan coordinated the Chinese Labour Office, recruiting volunteers to fill the empty jobs.  +
Only three days after the strike broke out, Tso had assembled more than 500 Chinese volunteers; three weeks later, he had 3,000 volunteers, much to the European community’s surprise.  +
Other loyal Chinese helped the government censor cables, mail, and newspapers.  +
Many Chinese joined the volunteer fire brigade and formed street committees and street guards to patrol their neighborhoods.  +
The District Watch Force helped maintain order, mediate, and prevent intimidation.  +
A group of Chinese business leaders founded the Commerce Protection Bureau, using their connections to import food from Macau, Shanghai, Saigon, Singapore, and Penang.  +
Many government employees resisted the call to strike.  +
By September 1925, only 1 of the 105 Chinese clerks, telephone operators, and interpreters working for the colonial government had left his post, while only 7 of the 335 policemen had deserted.  +
Similar performances were reported among the Water Police and the Chinese detectives stationed along the border in the New Territories.
罢工期间，华人社群和外籍人士积极协助政府。志愿者们在医院工作，驾驶电车。东华医院委员会成员经营小吃摊，低价售卖食品，许多华裔和欧亚裔人士加入了义勇军、特警后备队和圣约翰救伤队。曹善云负责协调华人劳工处，招募志愿者填补空缺职位。罢工爆发仅三天后，曹善云就召集了500多名华人志愿者；三周后，志愿者人数达到3000人，令欧洲社群大吃一惊。其他忠诚的华人协助政府审查电报、邮件和报纸。许多华人加入志愿消防队，并组建街道委员会和街头卫队巡逻社区。区治队协助维护秩序、调解纠纷，并防止恐吓行为。一群华人商界领袖成立了商业保护局，利用其人脉关系从澳门、上海、西贡、新加坡和槟城进口食品。许多政府雇员抵制了罢工的号召。到1925年9月，在殖民地政府工作的105名华人职员、电话接线员和翻译中，只有1人离职；335名警察中，也只有7人擅离职守。据报道，水警和驻守新界边境的华人侦探也出现了类似的情况。 +



The colonial government especially benefited from the help of two of the unofficial members of the Legislative Council, Chow Shouson and Robert Kotewall, the latter of whom, although Eurasian, held one of the two positions on the council reserved for Chinese and was generally considered a representative of the Chinese community.  +
Although they received anonymous letters threatening violence and murder and although rewards for their heads were posted in Canton, Chow and Kotewall orchestrated an intensive propaganda campaign to fight the strike.  +
They formed the CounterPropaganda Bureau, which plastered posters and distributed leaflets encouraging the population to resist the strikers.  +
The two also established the Commercial Press, a counterpropaganda newspaper circulated widely in Hong Kong and among overseas Chinese in the United States and Australia who had been supporting the strikers.  +
Chow and Kotewall also recommended that the governor order routine military marches and demonstrations as a show of strength.  +
They persuaded the government to establish the Labour Protection Bureau, a secret bureau to protect laborers from intimidators and to launch a counterattack against such intimidators.  +
Led by a retired Chinese pirate and general, the Labour Protection Bureau hired thugs and former pirates to protect workers who stayed at their jobs and to intimidate anyone who encouraged the strikers.  +
Officials in London expressed some concern about the bureau’s staff members and their previous experience, but Kotewall and Chow were unconcerned.
殖民政府尤其受益于立法会两位非正式成员——周寿燮和罗伯特·科特沃尔的帮助。科特沃尔虽是欧亚混血，却占据了立法会中为华人保留的两个席位之一，并被普遍视为华人社区的代表。尽管他们收到了匿名信，威胁要对他们施以暴力和谋杀，广州也悬赏捉拿他们，周寿燮和科特沃尔仍然精心策划了一场声势浩大的宣传运动来对抗罢工。他们成立了反宣传局，张贴海报、散发传单，鼓励民众抵制罢工者。两人还创办了《 商务印书报》， 这份反宣传报纸在香港以及支持罢工者的美国和澳大利亚华人中广泛发行。周寿燮和科特沃尔还建议总督下令举行例行军事游行和示威活动，以展示实力。他们说服政府成立了劳工保护局，这是一个秘密机构，旨在保护劳工免受恐吓，并对这些恐吓者发起反击。劳工保护局由一位退休的中国海盗兼将军领导，雇佣了暴徒和前海盗来保护坚守岗位的工人，并恐吓任何鼓励罢工的人。伦敦的官员对该局工作人员及其过往经历表示了一些担忧，但科特瓦尔和周却毫不在意。 +



For supporting the colonial government during the strike, Chow and Kotewall were branded in Canton as “running dogs” of the British imperialists.  +
Like other Chinese and Eurasian businessmen in Hong Kong, one reason the two helped the government end the strike was of course to protect their own interests.  +
However, this was more than an issue of protecting class interests: the two saw the strike as an ideological and economic war launched by Canton against Hong Kong.  +
Fighting the strike meant protecting the colony that they had helped fashion from the fabled barren rock and preserving a new way of life that they had helped shape.  +
Nor did these men see collaborating with the British as betraying China.  +
Because they viewed the Canton government as radical leftists, they considered working with the colonial government to stop the strike as a sign both of their loyalty to Hong Kong and of their patriotism to China.
周永康和郭德华因在罢工期间支持殖民政府，在广州被贴上了英国帝国主义“走狗”的标签。与其他在港的华裔和欧亚裔商人一样，他们二人帮助政府结束罢工的原因之一当然是为了维护自身利益。然而，这不仅仅是维护阶级利益的问题：他们将罢工视为广州对香港发动的一场意识形态和经济战争。参与罢工意味着保护他们从传说中的贫瘠岩石中一手缔造的殖民地，并维护他们参与塑造的新生活方式。他们也不认为与英国合作是背叛中国。因为他们视广州政府为激进左派，所以他们认为与殖民政府合作结束罢工既是对香港的忠诚，也是对中国的爱国之举。 +



After various attempts at negotiations by Governor Clementi—as well as threats of military force—and after a series of negotiations and political swings in Canton, in October 1926 the Canton government finally ended the strike.  +
Although Hong Kong’s economy eventually recovered, relations with Canton remained tense.  +
In the confusion leading up to Chiang Kai-shek’s attempt to unify China during the Northern Expedition of 1926–1927, Hong Kong was again the target of anti-British attacks.  +
In March 1927, Clementi reported that gunmen from Canton had been sent to assassinate him, Hallifax, Chow, Kotewall, and other loyal Chinese.  +
Better relations with Canton eventually developed, however, especially after Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang brutally purged the Communists in 1927.  +
Realizing that the strike had shown the power of Chinese nationalism and had also shown that Hong Kong and Canton society, politics, and economics could not be separated, Clementi and subsequent governors made sure to stay on good terms with the Canton government.
在金文泰总督多次尝试谈判以及动用武力威胁之后，经过广州一系列的谈判和政治风云变幻，1926年10月，广州政府最终结束了罢工。尽管香港经济最终复苏，但与广州的关系依然紧张。在蒋介石于1926-1927年北伐战争前夕，香港再次成为反英袭击的目标。1927年3月，金文泰报告称，广州派枪手前来刺杀他、哈利法克斯、周永康、科特沃尔以及其他忠于英国的华人。然而，香港与广州的关系最终有所改善，尤其是在蒋介石的国民党于 1927 年残酷清洗共产党之后。克莱门蒂和后来的几任总督意识到，这次罢工展现了中国民族主义的力量，也表明香港和广州的社会、政治和经济密不可分，因此他们确保与广州政府保持良好关系。 +



The general strike did not have a long-term impact on Hong Kong’s political or economic stability, but it had several important effects, not just on Hong Kong but also on Britain’s position in China.  +
The colonial government made it harder to express antigovernment views by requiring newspapers to pay a security fee.  +
In 1927 the Printers and Publishers Ordinance was revamped to prevent attacks against the colonial administration.  +
The Illegal Strike and Lockout Ordinance of 1927 made strikes illegal if they tried to coerce the government or had any objective beyond a dispute within a certain industry.  +
The government also banned all unions that had been involved in the strike and all politically motivated strikes.  +
Union funds could not be used for political purposes outside of Hong Kong, and no branch of any union in China could be formed in Hong Kong.
这次大罢工并未对香港的政治或经济稳定造成长期影响，但它产生了若干重要后果，不仅对香港，也对英国在中国的地位产生了影响。殖民政府要求报社缴纳保安费，从而加大了表达反政府观点的难度。1927年，《印刷及出版条例》进行了修订，以防止针对殖民政府的袭击。1927年的《非法罢工及停工条例》规定，任何试图胁迫政府或目的超出特定行业内部纠纷的罢工均为非法。政府还取缔了所有参与罢工的工会以及所有出于政治动机的罢工。工会资金不得用于香港以外的政治目的，任何中国工会的分支机构都不得在香港成立。 +



Well after the strike had ended, groups involved in anti-imperialist movements were forbidden to place advertisements in local newspapers, while news stories from abroad that dealt with imperialism, Communism, or Socialism were edited.  +
The government was so successful in harassing the Hong Kong branch of the Chinese Communist Party that this discouraged local residents from joining the party (although Hong Kong was where Ho Chi Minh founded the Vietnamese Communist Party in 1930).  +
Whereas in the 1920s Hong Kong had been an important base for Communist activities in Guangdong, after Chiang Kai-shek’s White Terror in 1927 the Hong Kong government worked hard to suppress Communist activities in the colony.  +
Often acting on tips from Guangdong authorities, the government arrested Communists and deported them to Guangdong, where they were executed.  +
The combination of Chiang’s suppression of Communism and the Hong Kong government’s “determination to crush any such movement” inhibited the growth of labor unionism in Hong Kong for twenty years.20
罢工结束后很久，参与反帝运动的团体仍被禁止在当地报纸上刊登广告，而涉及帝国主义、共产主义或社会主义的海外新闻报道也遭到删改。政府对中国共产党香港支部的打压如此成功，以至于当地居民都不愿加入共产党（尽管胡志明于 1930 年在香港创立了越南共产党）。20 世纪 20 年代，香港曾是广东共产党活动的重要基地，但在 1927 年蒋介石发动白色恐怖之后，香港政府竭力镇压殖民地内的共产党活动。政府经常根据广东当局提供的线索，逮捕共产党人并将他们遣送回广东处决。蒋介石对共产主义的镇压以及香港政府“决心粉碎任何此类运动”的双重打击，使得香港工会运动的发展停滞了二十年之久。 +



The colonial government also tried to use education to curb the growth of radical nationalism in Hong Kong.  +
During the general strike, Kotewall recommended that more emphasis in schools be placed on Confucianism as an antidote to the revolutionary nationalism engulfing China.  +
In 1927, Clementi encouraged some of the most distinguished Chinese scholars in Hong Kong—most of whom had left China after the 1911 revolution and during the May Fourth Movement—to promote traditional Chinese culture and morality in Hong Kong, promising to provide government support for a Chinese Department at the University of Hong Kong to train teachers for local schools.  +
By patronizing these scholars, Clementi tried to provide a cultural, moral, and political alternative to the revolutionary nationalism that had inspired the strikers.
殖民政府也试图利用教育来遏制香港激进民族主义的蔓延。在大罢工期间，科特瓦尔建议学校应更加重视儒家教育，以此对抗席卷中国的革命民族主义。1927年，金文泰鼓励香港一些最杰出的中国学者——他们大多在1911年辛亥革命和五四运动后离开中国——在香港弘扬中国传统文化和道德，并承诺政府资助香港大学设立中文系，为本地学校培养教师。通过扶持这些学者，金文泰试图为罢工者提供一种文化、道德和政治上的替代方案，以对抗激发罢工者的革命民族主义。 +



The strike failed to change the political status of Chinese in Hong Kong, but it showed the government that its Chinese subjects were to be taken seriously.  +
The government realized that it could no longer take workers for granted and that it needed to work more closely with leaders of the Chinese community.  +
Thus, in May 1926 Clementi appointed Chow Shouson as the first Chinese member of the Executive Council.  +
A strategic move designed to show strikers in Hong Kong and Canton that the government was willing to compromise, the appointment also represented a major shift in local colonial policy.  +
The important role that Canton had played as a sanctuary for strikers who returned “home” demonstrated to the colonial government that Chinese nationalism could not be taken lightly.  +
Clementi paid a visit to Canton in 1927, “symbolically inaugurating an era of rapprochement between China and the British colony.”21
这次罢工未能改变香港华人的政治地位，但它向政府表明，必须认真对待其华人臣民。政府意识到，它不能再将工人的意愿视为理所当然，需要与华人社区的领袖们更紧密地合作。因此，1926 年 5 月，金文泰任命周寿顺为行政会议的首位华人议员。这一战略举措旨在向香港和广州的罢工者表明政府愿意妥协，同时也标志着当地殖民政策的重大转变。广州作为罢工者返回“家园”的避难所所发挥的重要作用，向殖民政府表明，不能轻视华人民族主义。1927 年，金文泰访问广州，“象征性地开启了中国与英国殖民地关系缓和的新时代”。 21 +
Finally, the strike showed how Chinese nationalism could provoke enough of a crisis in Hong Kong to affect British policy toward China.  +
The strike hurt Hong Kong’s economy enough to convince the Foreign Office of the need to make concessions to China, which it did by surrendering the concessions at Hankou and Jiujiang in 1927–28 and Weihaiwei in 1930.  +
The Foreign Office became more convinced that working with the Kuomintang was the best way to protect British interests in China.  +
However, this strained relations among the British consul general at Canton, the British legation in Beijing, and the Hong Kong government, which feared that the others might sacrifice Hong Kong to improve Britain’s political and commercial position in China.  +
On several occasions during the interwar period, British officials suggested surrendering Hong Kong as a gesture of British goodwill in the face of rising Chinese nationalism, arguing that Britain no longer needed a colony to maintain its trading interests in China.  +
Exacerbating these tensions was the fact that although the Hong Kong government logically had to deal directly with Canton, the British diplomatic corps was in Beijing and insisted on being the only diplomatic channel for dealing with China.  +
The Foreign Office often criticized Hong Kong governors for trying to interfere with Canton politics, dismissing them as being out of touch with broader British goals in China and with China’s political situation.
最终，罢工表明，中国民族主义如何在香港引发足以影响英国对华政策的危机。罢工重创香港经济，使英国外交部意识到必须对中国做出让步，并于1927-28年放弃了汉口和九江租界，1930年又放弃了威海卫租界。英国外交部更加确信，与国民党合作是维护英国在华利益的最佳途径。然而，这导致英国驻广州总领事馆、英国驻北京公使馆和香港特区政府之间的关系紧张，他们担心其他各方可能会为了提升英国在中国的政治和商业地位而牺牲香港。在两次世界大战期间，英国官员曾多次建议放弃香港，以此作为英国在面对日益高涨的中国民族主义时展现善意的姿态，并辩称英国不再需要殖民地来维持其在华贸易利益。加剧这些紧张局势的是，尽管香港特区政府理应直接与广州方面交涉，但英国外交使团却驻扎在北京，并坚持认为英国是与中国打交道的唯一外交渠道。英国外交部经常批评香港特区长试图干预广州政治，认为他们脱离了英国在华的总体目标以及中国的政治局势。 +



SEPARATE WORLDS, SEPARATE LIVES
不同的世界，不同的生活
The strike-boycott of 1925–1926 showed that outside influences were never fully able to transform Chinese nationalism in Hong Kong into anticolonialism.  +
Many Chinese remained loyal to the colonial government, and Canton politics were too divided and volatile to create and sustain any serious anticolonial feelings.  +
On the contrary, the strike strengthened many Hong Kong people’s appreciation for the colony’s political and economic stability—especially in contrast to the political turbulence in neighboring Guangdong—and reaffirmed their sense of belonging and commitment to Hong Kong.  +
As sociologist Henry Lethbridge explains, “Hong Kong had come of age in 1925: it was no longer simply a congeries of various groups, composed of acquisitive, rootless, transient individuals, but was beginning to coalesce into a community and, if all racial divisions are included, into a plural society, its members bound together, as it were, in a network of contractual arrangements.  +
It had begun to acquire an identity.”22
1925-1926 年的罢工和抵制表明，外部影响始终未能将香港的中国民族主义完全转化为反殖民主义。许多中国人仍然效忠殖民政府，而广州的政治局势过于分裂和动荡，无法形成和维持任何严肃的反殖民情绪。相反，罢工增强了许多香港人对殖民地政治和经济稳定的欣赏——尤其与邻近广东的政治动荡形成鲜明对比——并重申了他们对香港的归属感和承诺。正如社会学家亨利·莱斯布里奇（Henry Lethbridge）所解释的那样，“香港在 1925 年已经成熟：它不再仅仅是由贪婪、无根、漂泊不定的个体组成的各种群体的集合体，而是开始凝聚成一个共同体，如果将所有种族差异都考虑在内，则是一个多元社会，其成员仿佛被束缚在一个契约网络中。它开始形成自己的身份认同。” 22 +
Even though they could come together to combat strikes, the Chinese and British communities lived largely separate lives.  +
Often blaming the failure to mix with Chinese on the latter’s preference for not mixing with foreigners, the British created an extensive social world that revolved around clubs, music, parties, formal dinners, and the annual St.  +
George’s and St.  +
Andrew’s balls.  +
British men who worked for firms such as the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank were expected to participate in bank-sponsored sports such as cricket that were seen as vital for both physical and mental health and for meeting European colleagues in other firms.  +
Chinese were generally excluded from most of these activities, as were most Eurasians (as late as the 1940s, for example, Chinese and Eurasians could not join the Cricket Club).  +
In both the colonial government and the European firms, there was a level that Chinese simply could not rise above.  +
European firms hired Chinese staffs, but almost never at the upper levels.  +
The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank had a policy of not having any Chinese on its board.  +
This often provoked resentment among the Chinese who had been educated at English schools and universities.
尽管华人社区和英国人社区可以联合起来对抗罢工，但他们的生活方式却基本各自独立。英国人常常将与华人社区难以融合的原因归咎于华人不愿与外国人交往，并构建了一个庞大的社交圈，围绕着俱乐部、音乐、派对、正式晚宴以及一年一度的圣乔治舞会和圣安德鲁舞会展开。在香港上海汇丰银行等公司工作的英国男性被要求参加银行赞助的体育活动，例如板球，这些活动被认为对身心健康至关重要，也是结识其他公司欧洲同事的绝佳机会。华人通常被排除在这些活动之外，大多数欧亚混血儿也同样如此（例如，直到20世纪40年代，华人和欧亚混血儿都不能加入板球俱乐部）。在殖民政府和欧洲公司中，华人似乎都无法晋升到更高的职位。欧洲公司会雇用华人员工，但几乎从不在高层任职。香港上海汇丰银行的政策是不让任何华人进入董事会。这常常引起在英国学校和大学接受过教育的中国人的不满。 +



Foreign firms generally had strict, though often unwritten, rules about their employees becoming involved with Chinese women.  +
European officers of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank were discouraged from marrying non-British women; until World War II no bank officer had married a Chinese.  +
Although marriage between European civil servants and non-European women was not legally forbidden, it was discouraged.  +
Some members of the Public Works Department had to sign an agreement that if they married Chinese women or took Chinese concubines they could be dismissed; those who married Chinese or Eurasians were not allowed to live in government quarters.  +
A few higher-ranking officers did marry Chinese, but this was frowned upon and ruined their chances for being promoted to another position in a different colony.  +
European policemen who married Chinese or Eurasians were not allowed to reenlist after their contracts expired.
外国公司通常对员工与中国女性交往有严格的规定，尽管这些规定往往不成文。香港上海汇丰银行的欧洲籍官员被劝阻不要与非英国籍女性结婚；直到二战前，还没有银行官员娶过中国人。虽然法律上并不禁止欧洲公务员与非欧洲籍女性结婚，但这种行为并不被鼓励。公共工程部的一些成员必须签署协议，承诺如果他们与中国女性结婚或纳中国妾，将被解雇；与中国人或欧亚混血儿结婚的人不得居住在政府宿舍。少数高级官员确实娶了中国人，但这受到谴责，并断送了他们在其他殖民地晋升的机会。与中国人或欧亚混血儿结婚的欧洲警察，在合同到期后不得续签服役合同。 +

The general feeling among Europeans was that Hong Kong was not a healthy place for European children to grow up.  +
These children were sent to schools in England or in China, where the weather was better and it was easier to get to Hong Kong for the holidays.  +
Those who stayed in Hong Kong generally attended one of the special schools for Europeans.  +
Eurasians usually went to Diocesan Boys’School or Diocesan Girls’School, while Chinese attended one of the government schools, such as Queen’s College or King’s College.  +
Many expatriates lived in constant fear that the Chinese would rise against them.  +
In June 1934, five young European children were allegedly thrown into a ditch by a Chinese man.  +
One child was killed, his body later found in the sea.
欧洲人普遍认为香港不适合欧洲儿童成长。这些孩子被送往英国或中国上学，那里气候宜人，假期也更容易回香港。留在香港的孩子通常就读于专门为欧洲人设立的学校。欧亚混血儿通常就读于拔萃男书院或拔萃女书院，而华裔则就读于政府学校，例如皇后书院或英皇书院。许多外籍人士生活在恐惧之中，担心华人会起来反抗他们。1934年6月，据称一名华人男子将五名欧洲幼童扔进沟渠。其中一名儿童溺亡，尸体后来在海中被发现。 +



Some Chinese and Eurasian leaders tried to curb the racial discrimination that permeated Hong Kong society.  +
In 1921 leaders of the various communities—including Jose Pedro Braga, later the first Portuguese appointed to the Legislative Council, and Lo Man Kam, the prominent Eurasian solicitor—formed the League of Fellowship, whose goal was to eliminate “racial disabilities” and to “promote good fellowship within the Colony, irrespective of race, class and creed.” For the most part, however, the various communities continued to keep their distance from each other—almost comfortably.  +
The political scientist who visited Hong Kong on the eve of World War II explained that “the racial bitterness which has caused so much trouble in India is not found in Hong Kong, although British and Chinese have separate clubs and, on the whole, social intercourse between the races is limited.  +
Many individuals however are on friendly terms; and perhaps also one may hazard the guess that the Chinese is too content with the society of those of his own race to trouble himself with his exclusion from European circles.  +
He has a robust sense of his own superiority, and has none of the hypersensitiveness and inferiority complex which make so many Indians, for example, bitterly resent their exclusion from Western society.”23
一些华裔和欧亚裔领袖试图遏制当时香港社会普遍存在的种族歧视。1921 年，包括后来成为首位进入立法会的葡萄牙裔人士何塞·佩德罗·布拉加（Jose Pedro Braga）和著名欧亚裔律师卢文锦（Lo Man Kam）在内的各族领袖成立了“同胞联盟”，其目标是消除“种族歧视”，并“促进殖民地内各族人民的友好情谊，不分种族、阶级和信仰”。然而，在大多数情况下，各族群之间仍然保持着一定的距离——这种距离感几乎是人之常情。二战前夕访问香港的政治学家解释说：“在印度造成诸多问题的种族仇恨在香港并不存在，尽管英国人和中国人各自拥有俱乐部，而且总体而言，不同种族之间的社交往来有限。然而，许多人关系友好；或许我们还可以大胆猜测，中国人过于满足于与同族人交往，以至于不会在意自己被排除在欧洲人圈子之外。他们有着强烈的优越感，不像许多印度人那样，对被西方社会排斥感到愤恨，并表现出过度敏感和自卑情结。” 23 +
PUBLIC WORKS AND SOCIAL WELFARE
公共工程和社会福利
The interwar period saw a greater interest in public works and in social legislation and welfare, both because of similar developments in Britain—where laissez-faire economics was losing popularity to the welfare state ideal—and because of the colonial government’s determination to limit the growth of Chinese nationalism and labor consciousness.  +
Completed in 1937 and named in honor of King George V, the Jubilee Reservoir in the New Territories boasted the tallest dam in the British Empire.  +
New roads were built, and land reclamation projects occurred on both sides of the harbor.  +
Medical and sanitary services also expanded, the Malaria Bureau was established in 1930, and the Urban Council replaced the Sanitary Board in 1936.  +
The government Kowloon Hospital opened in 1926; begun in the late 1920s, the Queen Mary Hospital opened in Pokfulam on Hong Kong Island in 1937.  +
The Building Ordinance of 1935 set standards for lighting and ventilation, although overcrowding continued because of the influx of refugees from China.  +
More schools were built, both for Chinese and Europeans, as were several teachers’ training colleges.
两次世界大战之间的时期，人们对公共工程、社会立法和福利的关注度显著提高，这既是因为英国也出现了类似的趋势——自由放任的经济政策逐渐被福利国家理念所取代——也是因为殖民政府决心限制中国民族主义和劳工意识的蔓延。1937年竣工并以乔治五世国王命名的银禧水库位于新界，拥有当时大英帝国最高的堤坝。新的道路修建起来，海港两岸也开展了填海造地工程。医疗卫生服务也得到了扩展，疟疾防治局于1930年成立，市政局于1936年取代了卫生局。政府运营的九龙医院于1926年开业。玛丽医院始建于20世纪20年代末，于1937年在香港岛薄扶林正式开业。1935年的《建筑物条例》规定了照明和通风标准，但由于大量来自中国的难民涌入，医院仍然人满为患。此外，还兴建了更多学校，包括面向华人和欧洲人的学校，以及数所师范学院。 +



As in Britain and the rest of the empire, there was more interest in social welfare.  +
Social protection in Hong Kong before the British arrived had traditionally come from family, clan, and lineage organizations.  +
Although European missionaries ran orphanages and other charitable institutions, until the 1920s social welfare was largely confined to Chinese organizations such as the Tung Wah Hospital and the Po Leung Kuk and to rich residents such as Clara Ho Tung, wife of Robert Ho Tung and a devout Buddhist who established temples and free schools for poor children in Hong Kong and Macau.  +
In the 1920s, however, the government began to take a more active role in providing social welfare.  +
This was a gradual process shaped by developments in Britain, China, and Hong Kong.  +
The idea of trusteeship rather than colonialism was becoming the norm, while new social legislation in Britain due mainly to the rise of the Labour Party, trade unions, and Socialists made the welfare state a popular alternative to the nineteenth-century ideal of laissez-faire individualism.  +
The flow of refugees from China soon exceeded the capacity of voluntary organizations to provide social welfare.  +
And although workers in Hong Kong were less politically conscious than those in Canton, partly because they (especially those working for European employers, who usually paid more than Chinese employers) were generally paid better than in Canton, the government hoped to limit the growth of labor consciousness by marginally improving working and living conditions.
与英国及其殖民地其他地区一样，香港对社会福利的关注度也更高。在英国人到来之前，香港的社会保障主要来自家族、宗族和世袭组织。尽管欧洲传教士开办了孤儿院和其他慈善机构，但在20世纪20年代之前，社会福利主要由东华医院、保良局等华人机构以及像何东夫人这样的富裕居民提供。何东夫人是何东的妻子，是一位虔诚的佛教徒，她在香港和澳门为贫困儿童创办了寺庙和免费学校。然而，到了20世纪20年代，政府开始在提供社会福利方面发挥更积极的作用。这是一个渐进的过程，受到英国、中国和香港发展的影响。托管而非殖民主义的理念逐渐成为主流，而英国新的社会立法（主要由于工党、工会和社会主义者的崛起）使得福利国家成为19世纪自由放任个人主义理想的一种受欢迎的替代方案。来自中国的难民涌入很快超过了志愿组织提供社会福利的能力。尽管香港工人的政治意识不如广州工人强烈（部分原因是他们的收入普遍高于广州工人，尤其是那些为欧洲雇主工作、通常欧洲雇主支付更高工资的工人），但政府希望通过略微改善工作和生活条件来限制劳工意识的觉醒。 +



Social welfare and legislation in Hong Kong were relatively progressive, at least in theory and when compared to other colonies such as Singapore or other Chinese cities such as Shanghai.  +
The Industrial Employment of Children Ordinance of 1922, the first in East Asia, prohibited the employment of children under age ten in factories or under age twelve in “dangerous trades” such as carrying coal, building materials, or debris; by the 1930s, child labor in factories had been largely eliminated.  +
The Factory Ordinance of 1927 appointed factory inspectors.  +
The same year, a labor division was established within the Secretary for Chinese Affairs.  +
The Industrial Employment of Women, Young Persons and Children Amendment Ordinance of 1929 regulated the employment of women in certain industries.  +
The Factories and Workshops Ordinance of 1932 kept children under age sixteen and women out of dangerous trades such as fireworks, glass-making, lead processing, and vermilion-making.  +
In 1938 the government appointed a labor officer to deal with unions, labor conditions, and trade disputes.
香港的社会福利和立法相对进步，至少在理论上如此，与其他殖民地（如新加坡）或中国其他城市（如上海）相比更是如此。1922年颁布的《工业童工雇佣条例》（东亚首例）禁止雇用10岁以下儿童在工厂工作，或12岁以下儿童从事“危险行业”（如搬运煤炭、建筑材料或垃圾）；到20世纪30年代，工厂童工现象已基本消除。1927年颁布的《工厂条例》设立了工厂督察员。同年，在中华总局内部设立了劳工处。1929年颁布的《工业妇女、青年及儿童雇佣条例修正》规范了妇女在某些行业的雇佣。1932年颁布的《工厂及作坊条例》禁止16岁以下儿童和妇女从事烟火、玻璃制造、铅加工和朱砂制作等危险行业。1938年，政府任命了一名劳工官员，负责处理工会、劳工状况和劳资纠纷。 +



Still, the colonial government always tried not to spend too much on social welfare, worrying that more immigrants would pour in from China if conditions in Hong Kong were too good.  +
“Even at its mightiest,” writes historian David Faure, “Britain had no social policy on Hong Kong as such.”24 In 1935 the government conceded that the “struggle for existence” in Hong Kong was “very severe” and that it would soon have to provide some sort of subsidized housing.25 Corpses were frequently abandoned in the streets, the families too poor to arrange for proper burials; the government reported more than thirteen hundred such corpses in 1937 alone.  +
Although colonial governors were encouraged to apply innovations from other colonies, they were rarely under great pressure from the Colonial Office to make any dramatic changes in their respective colonies.  +
Twice during the interwar period, for example, the Hong Kong government declined to pass legislation for compulsory workers’ compensation, even though it had been urged to do so.  +
Although in 1938 Governor Geoffrey Northcote argued that the government must increase taxation to keep from reducing social services, neither government nor management paid much attention to the welfare of workers.  +
A handful of companies—usually European—provided their workers with decent housing and working conditions, but most workplaces were dangerous and overcrowded.  +
In 1939, Labour Officer Butters reported that a tailoring establishment was “so overcrowded that one male worker engaged in ironing was found suspended from the roof on a beam with his ironing board suspended in front of him.”26
尽管如此，殖民政府始终尽量避免在社会福利方面投入过多资金，担心如果香港的条件过于优越，会有更多的移民从中国涌入。历史学家大卫·福尔写道：“即使在其鼎盛时期，英国也没有针对香港制定任何社会政策。” 1935 年，政府承认香港的“生存困境”十分严峻，并表示很快必须提供某种形式的补贴房屋。 尸体经常被遗弃在街头，家属贫困无力安排体面的葬礼； 仅 1937 年一年，政府就报告了超过 1300 具这样的尸体。尽管殖民地总督被鼓励借鉴其他殖民地的创新做法，但殖民地事务部很少向他们施加巨大压力，要求他们在各自的殖民地进行任何重大改革。例如，在两次世界大战期间，香港政府曾两次拒绝通过强制性工人赔偿法，尽管有人敦促其这样做。尽管 1938 年总督杰弗里·诺斯科特辩称，政府必须增加税收以避免削减社会服务，但政府和管理层都对工人的福利关注甚少。少数公司——通常是欧洲公司——为工人提供体面的住房和工作条件，但大多数工作场所危险且过度拥挤。1939 年，劳工官员巴特斯报告说，一家裁缝店“拥挤不堪，以至于一名正在熨衣服的男工人被发现悬挂在屋顶的横梁上，熨衣板也悬在他面前。” 26 +
PROSTITUTION AND MUI-TSAI
卖淫与梅子
The increased interest in social welfare and British reformers’ stronger interest in Hong Kong led to the revival of debates about prostitution and mui-tsai in the 1920s and 1930s.  +
Although the colonial government had been ordered by the Colonial Office to abolish licensed prostitution in Hong Kong at the turn of the century, by the 1920s it had devised a complex and extralegal system of regulating prostitution, using the various discretionary powers of the governor to close down any brothel that failed to comply with these regulations.  +
The secretary for Chinese affairs classified brothels into those dealing with Europeans, Indians, and Chinese.  +
As in the 1800s, the controls on prostitutes dealing with Europeans were much stricter.  +
The result was that venereal disease was kept under control among the European population but much less so in the Chinese population.  +
In the early 1920s, 30–40 percent of Chinese men were estimated to suffer from venereal diseases.
20 世纪 20 年代和 30 年代，人们对​​社会福利的日益关注以及英国改革者对香港的日益重视，导致关于卖淫和妓女的辩论再次兴起。尽管殖民地政府在世纪之交就奉殖民地事务部之命废除香港的持牌卖淫，但到了 20 世纪 20 年代，它却制定了一套复杂且游离于法律之外的卖淫管制体系，利用总督的各种自由裁量权关闭任何不遵守规定的妓院。中华事务局局长将妓院分为服务于欧洲人、印度人和中国人的三类。与 19 世纪一样，对服务于欧洲人的妓女的管制更为严格。结果是，性病在欧洲人群体中得到了有效控制，但在中国人群体中却远未得到控制。据估计，在 20 世纪 20 年代初期，30%至 40%的中国男性患有性病。 +



The pressure to end licensed prostitution came from three main sources: reformers in Britain, the League of Nations, and a group of local European women.  +
The latter group included Penelope Clementi, wife of Governor Clementi; Mrs.  +
Wolfe, wife of the inspector general of police; Mrs.  +
Tratman, wife of Secretary for Chinese Affairs D.  +
W.  +
Tratman; and Bella Woolf Southorn, wife of the colonial secretary, Wilfred Southorn.  +
Licensed brothels were gradually closed down in Hong Kong from 1931 to 1935, with predictable results: more soliciting on the streets, higher incidence of venereal disease among European soldiers and sailors, and an increased number of so-called sly brothels disguised as massage parlors, saunas, and bathhouses.  +
The Japanese instituted a system of regulated and inspected brothels when they took over in 1941, but these were closed down after the British returned in 1945.
结束合法卖淫的压力主要来自三个方面：英国的改革者、国际联盟以及一群当地的欧洲女性。后者包括总督克莱门蒂的妻子佩内洛普·克莱门蒂、警察总监的妻子沃尔夫夫人、中华事务局局长特拉特曼的妻子特拉特曼夫人以及殖民地大臣威尔弗雷德·索索恩的妻子贝拉·伍尔夫·索索恩。从1931年到1935年，香港的合法妓院逐渐被关闭，其后果可想而知：街头拉客现象增多，欧洲士兵和水手的性病发病率上升，以及伪装成按摩院、桑拿浴室和澡堂的所谓“黑店”数量增加。1941年日本接管香港后，建立了一套规范和检查妓院的制度，但这些制度在1945年英国返回后也被关闭。 +



The mui-tsai issue had drawn quite a bit of local publicity in 1917 during a legal case involving two mui-tsai who had allegedly been kidnapped.  +
A British member of Parliament who happened to be passing through town took the case to the Colonial Office, asking how slavery could not only be tolerated but could even be protected by law in the British Empire.  +
The Colonial Office was terribly embarrassed and seemed unaware that the system had been discussed back in the 1880s.  +
In August 1918, Governor May explained that although slavery was illegal in Hong Kong, the mui-tsai system was not slavery and was so prevalent that almost every family that could afford a mui-tsai had at least one.  +
Because the Colonial Office agreed that it could not interfere too much with local customs, it recommended that the issue be allowed to drop.  +
In 1921 the secretary of Chinese affairs reported that half of all Chinese families in Hong Kong had mui-tsai.
1917 年，一起涉及两名据称被绑架的梅菜的案件引起了当地不少关注。一位恰巧路过香港的英国议员将此案提交给殖民地事务部，质问为何在英帝国境内， 奴隶制不仅被容忍，甚至还能得到法律保护。殖民地事务部对此感到非常尴尬，似乎并不知晓早在 19 世纪 80 年代就有人讨论过这一制度。1918 年 8 月，梅总督解释说，虽然奴隶制在香港是非法的，但梅菜制度并非奴隶制，而且非常普遍，几乎每个有能力养梅菜的家庭都至少养了一个。由于殖民地事务部也认为不宜过多干预当地习俗，因此建议此事就此作罢。1921 年，中华事务司司长报告称，香港半数华人家庭都养有梅菜。 +



One of the most intense and protracted British colonial policy disputes in the interwar period, the anti-mui-tsai campaign had three main differences from that in the 1880s.  +
It focused more on the system itself rather than on the prostitution aspect.  +
This time, the campaign had help from all sorts of places: British women in Hong Kong, a small group of local Chinese, members of Parliament in Britain, religious leaders (including the archbishops of York and Canterbury), and international women’s groups.  +
And since the system had been banned in China after the 1911 revolution (although the ban had never been effectively enforced), no one in Hong Kong could claim that it should be allowed simply because it was a Chinese tradition.
两次世界大战期间，英国殖民政策中最激烈、持续时间最长的争端之一——反娼运动，与 19 世纪 80 年代的娼妓运动有三大主要区别。首先，它更关注娼妓制度本身，而非娼妓行为。其次，这次运动得到了各方支持：在港的英国女性、一小群当地华人、英国议会议员、宗教领袖（包括约克大主教和坎特伯雷大主教）以及国际妇女团体。此外，由于娼妓制度在 1911 年革命后在中国已被取缔（尽管禁令从未得到有效执行），因此香港没有人能够仅仅因为娼妓是中国传统就主张其在香港合法存在。 +



A key mover in the anti-mui-tsai campaign was Clara Haslewood, wife of a commander in the Royal Navy stationed in Hong Kong.  +
After a barrage of critical letters to the press offended leaders of the Chinese community, Governor Stubbs asked the Admiralty to transfer Haslewood’s husband.  +
But the two spent their retirement in Britain rallying against the mui-tsai system by writing the press and members of Parliament.  +
Soon the Colonial Office was receiving complaints from groups such as the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Protection Society, the Fabian Society, the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, and the League of Nations Union.  +
As the campaign gained steam in Britain, the Hong Kong Anti-Mui Tsai Society was founded in 1921, its organizing committee almost all Chinese.  +
The two Chinese members of the Legislative Council responded by establishing the Society for the Protection of Mui Tsai to help regulate the system instead of ending it.  +
The Anti-Mui Tsai Society, which also received backing from local groups such as the Young Women’s Christian Association, established in 1920, was able to win over many of the labor unions and to gain support from the foreign community, especially since its English secretary, C.  +
G.  +
Anderson, wrote regularly to the newspapers in Hong Kong and Britain.  +
But the Society for the Protection of Mui Tsai had the Tung Wah Hospital Committee, the District Watch Committee, and the Po Leung Kuk on its side.
反梅傩运动的关键人物之一是克拉拉·哈斯伍德，她是驻港皇家海军一位指挥官的妻子。她向报刊发表了一系列批评梅傩制度的信件，激怒了华人社区的领袖，以至于总督斯塔布斯要求海军部将哈斯伍德的丈夫调离香港。然而，这对夫妇退休后留在英国，继续通过写信给报刊和议员来反对梅傩制度。很快，殖民地事务部就收到了来自反奴隶制和原住民保护协会、费边社、国际妇女参政联盟以及国际联盟等团体的投诉。随着这场运动在英国愈演愈烈，香港反梅傩协会于 1921 年成立，其组织委员会几乎全部由华人组成。立法会的两位华人议员则成立了保梅傩协会，旨在规范梅傩制度，而不是废除它。反梅娼会也得到了包括基督教女青年会（成立于 1920 年）在内的本地团体的支持，成功争取到了许多工会的支持，并获得了海外社群的支持，尤其得益于其英文秘书 CG Anderson 定期向香港和英国的报纸投稿。但护梅娼会则得到了东华医院委员会、区监察委员会和保良局的支持。 +



In February 1922, Secretary for the Colonies Winston Churchill, who had previously defended the system, argued to the House of Commons that the system should be abolished.  +
Although Governor Stubbs argued that the timing was bad—the colony was still recovering from the seamen’s strike—and the Chinese bourgeoisie opposed abolishing the system, Churchill promised the House of Commons that the system would be ended within a year.  +
The leaders of the Chinese community insisted that the system benefited the girls and their parents and prevented infanticide, and Stubbs warned the Colonial Office that interfering too much in local customs might even turn the Chinese against their British rulers.  +
Still, the Female Domestic Service Ordinance was passed in 1923, although Stubbs distanced himself from the ordinance by insisting that the well-meaning reformers in Britain simply did not understand the system or Chinese customs.  +
(As in the late 1800s, there was no single Chinese view toward the practice, but the colonial government dismissed to the British government as not representative the Chinese who opposed the mui-tsai system.) And the bill ended up doing very little, except mainly to prohibit any new mui-tsai transactions and domestic service for girls under ten years of age.  +
But after Stubbs reported in 1924 that no new mui-tsai had been engaged and that the number of mui-tsai had dropped considerably, the Colonial Office let the issue go.  +
Although reports in the mid-1930s suggested that the number of mui-tsai had probably increased after 1923, the bill temporarily ended all agitation in Britain.
1922 年 2 月，曾为该制度辩护的殖民地事务大臣温斯顿·丘吉尔在下议院提出废除该制度的动议。尽管总督斯塔布斯认为时机不佳——殖民地仍在从海员罢工中恢复——而且华人资产阶级也反对废除该制度，丘吉尔仍向下议院承诺一年内废除该制度。华人社区领袖坚持认为该制度有利于女孩及其父母，并能防止杀婴，斯塔布斯警告殖民地事务部，过度干预当地习俗甚至可能使华人反抗英国统治者。尽管如此，《女佣家政服务条例》还是在 1923 年获得通过，但斯塔布斯却与该条例划清界限，坚称英国那些好心的改革者根本不了解该制度或中国习俗。 （如同 19 世纪末一样，华人对这种做法并没有统一的看法，但殖民政府却以华人反对 “卖身契” 制度不具代表性为由，拒绝向英国政府提出异议。）最终，这项法案收效甚微，主要内容是禁止任何新的 “卖身契” 交易以及为十岁以下女孩提供家政服务。但 1924 年，斯塔布斯报告称，没有新增 “卖身契”的案例，而且 “卖身契” 的数量也大幅下降，殖民地事务部便不再追究此事。尽管 20 世纪 30 年代中期的报道显示， “卖身契” 的数量在 1923 年后可能有所增加，但这项法案暂时平息了英国国内的所有抗议活动。 +



The mui-tsai issue reemerged, however, after the Canton government abolished all forms of slavery in March 1927 and canceled the deeds for the transfer of mui-tsai.  +
In October 1928, the newly revived Anti-Mui Tsai Society declared that conditions had become even worse since 1923 and sent details to groups in Britain.  +
When the secretary of the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Protection Society learned about the situation, he wrote a letter to the liberal Manchester Guardian that was soon published in a widely circulated pamphlet.  +
The Colonial Office was in a spot: it had failed to fulfill Churchill’s promise to Parliament, and now the new governor, Clementi, was defending the system.  +
Clementi argued that there was no evidence that the number of mui-tsai had increased and that the system could not be abolished any faster without alienating the Chinese population, especially as long as the system continued to exist in China, where the laws against it were not being enforced.  +
Convinced that reforming or abolishing the system would be more harmful than useful, Clementi may have been right: the number of abandoned dead babies and children was 1,851 in 1929, some 300 more than in 1928 and about 700 more than in 1927.
然而，1927 年 3 月广州政府废除一切形式的奴隶制并取消了奴役契约后， 奴役问题再次浮出水面。1928 年 10 月，新近复兴的反奴役协会宣称，自 1923 年以来，奴役状况甚至更加恶化，并将详情发送给了英国的团体。反奴隶制和原住民保护协会的秘书得知此事后，致信自由派报纸《曼彻斯特卫报》 ，该信很快被印成小册子广泛传播。殖民地事务部陷入困境：它未能兑现丘吉尔对议会的承诺，而新任总督克莱门蒂却在为奴役制度辩护。克莱门蒂辩称，没有证据表明奴役人数有所增加，而且如果不疏远华人，就无法更快地废除奴役制度，尤其是在中国，由于相关法律并未得到执行，奴役制度仍然存在。克莱门蒂确信改革或废除该制度弊大于利，他的看法或许是对的：1929 年被遗弃的死婴和死儿童的数量为 1851 人，比 1928 年增加了约 300 人，比 1927 年增加了约 700 人。 +



Many of the Britons who had been involved in the campaign in the early 1920s now resurfaced, distributing articles with such inflammatory titles as “Little Yellow Slaves under the Union Jack.” As historian Susan Pedersen argues, the issue was “not only about the definition of‘slavery,’ but also about the wider character and the obligations of British rule.”27 Part of a maternalist trend in Britain and throughout the British Empire, the campaign showed how British women were beginning to play an activist role in the expansion of social services in their empire.  +
But there was also more than a hint of racism, for many of the British reformers were convinced that only British women, not any Chinese groups, could care for the freed mui-tsai.
许多曾在 20 世纪 20 年代初参与这场运动的英国人如今再次出现，散发着诸如《英国国旗下的小黄奴》等煽动性标题的文章。正如历史学家苏珊·佩德森所言，这个问题“不仅关乎‘奴隶制’的定义，还关乎英国统治的更广泛的性质和义务”。 27 作为英国乃至整个大英帝国母性主义思潮的一部分，这场运动表明英国女性开始在帝国社会服务的扩展中发挥积极作用。但其中也隐隐透露出种族主义的意味，因为许多英国改革者坚信，只有英国女性，而非任何华人团体，才有资格照顾获释的梅菜。 +



In response to so much pressure, in 1929 the Legislative Council passed an amendment stipulating that mui-tsai were to be registered and paid wages.  +
Although registration eventually increased and the Colonial Office was generally satisfied, the 1929 amendments did not please everyone.  +
Legislative Council member Tso Seen Wan argued that far from being a slave, a mui-tsai was treated as a foster daughter.  +
As such, she might be asked to “do such service as a natural daughter might be called upon to at any time.”28 Many Chinese resented the amendment for stigmatizing having a mui-tsai.  +
The Anti-Mui Tsai Society claimed that fewer than half of the mui-tsai were actually registered.  +
After more pressure from societies in Britain, in July 1931 the government added a police inspector and two Chinese female inspectors to help register mui-tsai.  +
Finally, in response to increased pressure in Britain and a colonial inquiry (the Woods Commission) prompted by the League of Nations’ Permanent Advisory Committee of Experts on Slavery, in April 1938 the Legislative Council passed legislation making it compulsory to register all adopted girls with the secretary for Chinese affairs.  +
However, this affected only girls who were actually registered (of which there were still more than one thousand) and did little to end the large number of girls being sold into prostitution.  +
The mui-tsni system lasted beyond the end of World War II, with cases being reported even into the 1970s.
迫于各方压力，立法会于 1929 年通过一项修正案，规定女佣必须登记并领取工资。尽管登记人数最终有所增加，殖民地事务部也基本满意，但 1929 年的修正案并非人人赞同。立法会议员曹善婉认为， 女佣并非奴隶，而是被视为养女。因此，她随时可能被要求“像亲生女儿一样服侍他人”。 28 许多华人对此修正案感到不满，认为它给拥有女佣的行为蒙上了污名。 反女佣协会声称，实际登记的女佣不足一半。在英国各社团的进一步施压下，政府于 1931 年 7 月增派一名警督和两名华裔女督察，协助女佣登记工作。 最终，在英国日益增长的压力以及国际联盟奴隶制问题常设专家咨询委员会促成的殖民地调查（伍兹委员会）的推动下，立法会于 1938 年 4 月通过立法，强制所有被收养的女孩在中华事务局局长处登记。然而，这项立法仅对实际登记的女孩有效（当时仍有超过一千名女孩），对阻止大量女孩被贩卖卖淫几乎毫无作用。 “卖淫嫖娼” 制度一直延续到二战结束之后，甚至在 20 世纪 70 年代仍有相关案例报道。 +



RERRENCHMENT  裁员
Partly because it benefited from the Imperial Preferences system instituted after the Imperial Economic Conference of 1932 in Ottawa, Hong Kong was not seriously hurt by the Great Depression.  +
Still, officials in Britain and in Hong Kong grew concerned about the colony’s expenditures and began to demand retrenchment in the civil service by appointing more non-Europeans.  +
Although governors frequently drew attention to the large number of Europeans in the public sector compared to other British colonies, until 1930 there was no local demand to replace Europeans with local Chinese civil servants.  +
On the contrary, in 1914 the European unofficial members of the Legislative Council requested that the government hire more European nurses at the government civil hospital, even though the hospital already had more Europeans than in similar hospitals in the British Empire.  +
In 1921, there were more than 180 Europeans in the police force, compared with 40 in Singapore and 23 in Ceylon (whose population was more than six times that of Hong Kong).  +
Not only was this an issue of racial discrimination, it was also very costly.  +
In 1914 a European police constable received more than seven times the pay of a local Chinese or Indian constable, while in 1939, the lowest-ranking European policeman received almost eight times the pay of a Chinese of the same rank.
部分原因是得益于1932年渥太华帝国经济会议后设立的帝国特惠制，香港并未受到大萧条的严重冲击。尽管如此，英国和香港的官员仍对殖民地的开支感到担忧，并开始要求通过任命更多非欧洲裔人士来精简公务员队伍。虽然总督经常强调香港公共部门的欧洲裔人士数量远超其他英国殖民地，但直到1930年，香港本地并没有要求用华裔公务员取代欧洲裔人士。相反，1914年，立法会的欧洲裔非官方议员要求政府在公立医院增聘欧洲裔护士，尽管当时该医院的欧洲裔护士人数已经超过了英属殖民地其他同类医院。1921年，香港警队中有超过180名欧洲裔人士，而新加坡只有40名，锡兰（人口是香港的六倍多）也只有23名。这不仅是种族歧视问题，而且代价高昂。1914年，一名欧洲裔警察的薪水是当地华裔或印度裔警察的七倍多；而到了1939年，级别最低的欧洲裔警察的薪水几乎是同级别华裔警察的八倍。 +



Colonial officials and European residents often justified the large numbers of Europeans in government service by arguing that they were less corrupt and more trustworthy and efficient than Chinese as well as more loyal to Britain.  +
Fearing that Cantonese policemen would be neither able nor willing to control their fellow Cantonese, the government recruited policemen from Britain, India, or Weihaiwei.  +
Only on the eve of World War II were Chinese police admitted at the rank of subinspector, and even then they were under the control of more junior British officers.  +
Many clerical positions held by Europeans were subsequently filled by their sons.  +
(Some of these Europeans were in fact more connected to Hong Kong than most Chinese residents were.  +
According to the 1931 census, Europeans in Hong Kong were slightly less migratory than urban Chinese, for 8.5 percent of them had been in Hong Kong for more than thirty years, compared to 6.4 percent for the urban Chinese.) Neither the European nor the Chinese unofficial members of the Legislative Council urged the government to hire more local residents.  +
Although the Colonial Office preferred more local appointments as a way to lower salaries, it rarely tried to pressure the Hong Kong government into doing so.
殖民官员和欧洲居民常常辩称，政府部门大量聘用欧洲人，是因为欧洲人比中国人更廉洁、更值得信赖、效率更高，也更忠于英国。由于担心广东警察既无力也无意管束同胞，政府从英国、印度或威海卫招募警察。直到二战前夕，中国警察才被允许担任副督察一职，即便如此，他们也受制于级别更低的英国警官。许多欧洲人担任的文职职位后来都由他们的儿子接任。（事实上，一些欧洲人与香港的联系比大多数中国居民更为紧密。根据1931年的人口普查，香港的欧洲人比城市中国人的迁徙程度略低，其中8.5%的欧洲人在香港居住超过30年，而城市中国人的这一比例为6.4%。）立法会的欧洲和中国非官方议员都没有敦促政府雇用更多本地居民。虽然殖民地事务部更倾向于更多地聘用本地人以降低工资，但它很少试图向香港政府施压，迫使其这样做。 +



After 1930, when a report on government salaries led to a public uproar, governors and the Chinese, Eurasian, and Portuguese members of the Legislative Council increasingly called for more local hires.  +
Lo Man Kam, the Eurasian lawyer and one of the “Chinese” unofficial members of the Legislative Council, vigorously supported this policy, which was accepted by Governor Andrew Caldecott in 1935.  +
In 1936 the government agreed, in principle, that before vacancies were advertised in Britain, qualified local candidates would be considered.  +
Progress was slow, however, not just because of the entrenched vested interests of the European community but also because the low salaries compared to those for Europeans discouraged qualified Chinese candidates from applying.  +
Although differences in pay actually increased during the 1930s because of the depreciation of the Hong Kong dollar, the Chinese and Eurasian unofficial members of the Legislative Council never insisted that Chinese should draw the same salaries as Europeans.  +
Chinese did not serve in large numbers until after World War II, and even though in 1946 Britain’s Labour government ordered that civil service positions throughout the empire should be opened to local recruits, up to 1966 only a handful of Chinese had been appointed to senior government positions.  +
“Until localization was the order of the day, in the 1980s,” concludes David Faure, “no Hong Kong Chinese, however well educated and however well established in his or her own profession, could reasonably have seen that he or she could have gone very far in government service.”29
1930 年，一份关于政府薪俸的报告引发公众强烈抗议后，港督和立法会的华裔、欧亚裔及葡裔议员日益呼吁更多地雇用本地人。欧亚裔律师罗文锦是立法会“华裔”非正式议员之一，他大力支持这项政策，并于 1935 年被港督嘉德阁采纳。1936 年，政府原则上同意，在英国刊登职位空缺广告之前，会优先考虑符合条件的本地候选人。然而，进展缓慢，这不仅是因为欧洲共同体根深蒂固的既得利益，也是因为与欧洲人相比，香港的薪俸较低，令符合条件的华裔候选人望而却步。尽管由于港元贬值，20 世纪 30 年代华裔和欧裔之间的薪俸差距实际上有所扩大，但立法会的华裔和欧裔非正式议员从未坚持要求华裔应与欧洲人领取同等薪俸。二战后，华人才开始大量服役。尽管 1946 年英国工党政府下令，整个帝国的公务员职位都应向本地人开放，但直到 1966 年，也只有极少数华人被任命为政府高级职位。戴维·福尔总结道：“直到 20 世纪 80 年代本地化成为主流政策之前，任何香港华人，无论受过多么良好的教育，无论在各自的专业领域多么成功，都很难想象自己能在政府部门获得很高的晋升机会。” 29 +
