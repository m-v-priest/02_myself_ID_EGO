The Countdown to 1997  1997年的倒计时
By the late 1980s, most people in Hong Kong had reluctantly accepted the inevitability of Hong Kong’s reversion to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.  +
According to a 1988 poll, more than half of the respondents believed that reversion to Chinese rule would hurt civil rights and individual liberty.  +
Almost half said that they trusted the Hong Kong government, about 30 percent said that they trusted the British government, but only about 20 percent said that they trusted the Chinese government.  +
More than 70 percent wanted the Hong Kong government to be democratic (although only 25 percent supported the creation of political parties).  +
The events in Beijing during the spring of 1989, however, caused many people in Hong Kong to lose all faith in the Chinese government and to “consciously ...  +
reevaluate their identities and their options for the future.”1
到了 20 世纪 80 年代末，香港的大多数民众虽然不情愿，但也接受了香港将于 1997 年回归中国这一不可避免的事实。根据 1988 年的一项民意调查，超过半数的受访者认为回归中国会损害公民权利和个人自由。近半数受访者表示信任香港政府，约 30%表示信任英国政府，但只有约 20%表示信任中国政府。超过 70%的受访者希望香港政府实行民主制度（尽管只有 25%支持成立政党）。然而，1989 年春季北京发生的事件，导致许多香港民众对中国政府彻底失去信心，并“有意识地……重新评估自身的身份认同和未来的选择” 。¹ +
After the death on April 15, 1989, of former Chinese Communist Party (CCP) general secretary Hu Yaobang, who had been sacked for failing to end student demonstrations in 1986, university students in Beijing organized a series of prodemocracy demonstrations.  +
By May 4, the seventieth anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, the demonstrations had attracted the world’s attention.  +
On May 13, the students occupied Tiananmen Square, where they began a hunger strike protesting government corruption and demanding democratic reforms.  +
In Hong Kong, the demonstrations in Beijing were hopeful signs that China was on the verge of becoming more democratic.  +
However, when Premier Li Peng imposed martial law on May 20, more than five hundred thousand Hong Kong people braved a typhoon and marched in the streets to show their support for the demonstrators.
1989年4月15日，中共前总书记胡耀邦逝世。胡耀邦因未能平息1986年的学生运动而被免职。此后，北京的大学生组织了一系列支持民主的示威活动。到5月4日，即五四运动七十周年纪念日，这些示威活动已引起全世界的关注。5月13日，学生们占领了天安门广场，开始绝食抗议政府腐败，要求进行民主改革。在香港，北京的示威活动被视为中国即将走向更加民主的希望之兆。然而，5月20日，李鹏总理宣布戒严令后，超过五十万香港市民冒着台风走上街头，声援示威者。 +



Some marched to show their Chinese patriotism.  +
Others were frustrated that Hong Kong people had been left out of the Sino-British negotiations and the Joint Declaration.  +
Leaders of the local democracy movement organized the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China, which quickly raised money, mainly through a huge pop concert, to send blankets, sleeping bags, and tents for the students in Beijing.  +
The demonstrations in Beijing also convinced many people of the need to accelerate Hong Kong’s own democratization.  +
On May 24, the official members of the Executive and Legislative Councils unanimously agreed that 50 percent of Hong Kong’s legislature should be directly elected by 1995 and 100 percent by 2003.  +
Even conservative businesspeople who had normally opposed the introduction of democracy in Hong Kong started to express their support for the students and to hope that political reform in China might accelerate democratization in Hong Kong.
一些人游行示威，表达对中国的爱国情怀。另一些人则对香港人被排除在中英谈判和《联合声明》之外感到不满。香港民主运动的领袖们组织了“香港支持中国爱国民主运动联盟”，该联盟迅速筹款，主要通过一场大型流行音乐会，为北京的学生送去毯子、睡袋和帐篷。北京的示威活动也让许多人意识到加快香港自身民主化的必要性。5月24日，行政会议和立法会的正式成员一致同意，到1995年香港立法会50%的席位应由直接选举产生，到2003年应实现100%直接选举。就连通常反对香港民主化的保守派商界人士也开始表达对学生的支持，并希望中国的政治改革能够加速香港的民主化进程。 +



TIANANMEN SQUARE: REACTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
天安门广场：各方反应及影响
The Tiananmen Square Massacre on June 4 “sent the whole colony into mourning.”2 Like the millions of people across the world who saw images of the massacre on television, people in Hong Kong were shocked, disgusted, and horrified.  +
They also worried that something similar could happen in Hong Kong after 1997.  +
In the largest public demonstration in Hong Kong’s history, almost one million people—many of them dressed in the traditional Chinese mourning colors of black and white or wearing black armbands—marched in the streets to support the fallen demonstrators and to condemn the PRC leadership.  +
The protests brought out all elements of Hong Kong’s population, including otherwise apolitical businesspeople, pro-Beijing trade unionists, and employees of the Bank of China and pro-Beijing newspapers.  +
The cenotaph in Central District honoring Hong Kong’s war dead was covered with flowers and black flags.  +
Many people donated blood.  +
Others tried to force a run on local PRC banks by withdrawing all their deposits.  +
The Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China received more than thirty million Hong Kong dollars in donations to support prodemocracy activities in the PRC.
6 月 4 日天安门广场大屠杀“让整个殖民地陷入了悲痛之中”。 2 与全世界数百万通过电视看到屠杀画面的人们一样，香港民众感到震惊、愤慨和恐惧。他们也担心 1997 年后类似的悲剧会在香港重演。在香港历史上规模最大的公众示威活动中，近百万人——其中许多人身着黑白两色的传统中国丧服或佩戴黑色臂章——走上街头，声援遇难的示威者，并谴责中华人民共和国领导层。抗议活动吸引了香港各界人士参与，包括平时不关心政治的商人、亲北京的工会成员以及中国银行和亲北京报社的员工。位于中环的香港战争死难者纪念碑上摆满了鲜花和黑旗。许多人献血。还有一些人试图通过提取所有存款来制造香港本地银行的挤兑。支持中国爱国民主运动联盟收到超过三千万港元的捐款，用于支持中华人民共和国的民主活动。 +



Tiananmen Square changed local attitudes toward the 1997 transition and the Chinese government.  +
Older Chinese who had left the mainland before or after the Communists took over in 1949 had often kept their negative views of the PRC.  +
But many younger people had been convinced that the Chinese government had changed, especially after Deng Xiaoping’s reforms in the late 1970s.  +
Tiananmen Square, however, caused many Hong Kong people to lose all faith in the PRC government and in Hong Kong’s future.  +
This was reflected in how the stock market dropped by 25 percent and property values sank while applications for immigration visas soared, and in surveys later that year that showed how confidence in the PRC not to make changes after 1997 had plummeted.  +
Democratic Party leader Martin Lee compared handing over Hong Kong people to China with surrendering Jews to Adolf Hitler’s Germany.  +
Lydia Dunn, a prominent businesswoman and member of the Executive Council, asked how the British could in good conscience surrender “British citizens to a regime that did not hesitate to use its tanks and forces on its own people.”
天安门事件改变了香港本地人对1997年政权更迭和中国政府的态度。在1949年共产党执政前后离开大陆的老一辈中国人，往往对中华人民共和国抱有负面看法。但许多年轻人，尤其是在邓小平20世纪70年代末推行改革之后，一直坚信中国政府已经改变。然而，天安门事件却让许多香港人彻底丧失了对中国政府和香港未来的信心。这体现在股市暴跌25%，房地产价格暴跌，而移民签证申请却激增；也体现在当年晚些时候的调查中，调查显示，人们对中华人民共和国在1997年后不会做出改变的信心急剧下降。民主党领袖李柱铭甚至将香港人移交给中国比作将犹太人交给希特勒的德国。著名女商人、行政委员会成员莉迪亚·邓恩质问道，英国人怎么能昧着良心将“英国公民拱手让给一个毫不犹豫地用坦克和军队对付自己人民的政权”呢？ +
The initial British reaction to the Tiananmen Square Massacre was shock.  +
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher expressed “utter revulsion and outrage” at the killings, promising to help assuage the concerns of Hong Kong people by relaxing British immigration laws.  +
In July 1989, the British government unilaterally suspended the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group meetings scheduled for that summer.  +
Nevertheless, the British insisted that the 1984 Joint Declaration remained in force and that Beijing had pledged to keep Hong Kong autonomous for fifty years.  +
And there was little the British government could do.  +
When Thatcher raised the Hong Kong situation that summer at several international forums, the People’s Daily accused the British of trying to use international support to keep China from recovering Hong Kong.  +
The British did, however, take several measures designed to appease the international community and to restore confidence in Hong Kong: a nationality plan that would encourage people to stay in Hong Kong, the acceleration of representative government, and a Bill of Rights that would continue after 1997.
英国对天安门事件的最初反应是震惊。首相玛格丽特·撒切尔对屠杀事件表示“极度厌恶和愤慨”，并承诺通过放宽英国移民法来缓解香港民众的担忧。1989 年 7 月，英国政府单方面暂停了原定于当年夏季举行的中英联合联络小组会议。尽管如此，英国方面仍然坚持 1984 年《中英联合声明》仍然有效，北京方面也承诺香港将保持 50 年的自治。而英国政府对此也几乎无能为力。那年夏天，当撒切尔在多个国际论坛上提及香港局势时， 《人民日报》 指责英国试图利用国际支持阻止中国收回香港。然而，英国也采取了一些旨在安抚国际社会并恢复国际社会对香港信心的措施：一项旨在鼓励人们留在香港的国籍计划、加快代议制政府的建设，以及一项将在 1997 年后继续生效的《人权法案》。 +



British officials, Hong Kong government officials, and local business leaders realized that a sudden exodus from Hong Kong could have catastrophic results.  +
The Legislative and Executive Councils thus launched the “Hong Kong is Our Home” campaign, asking the British government to give full British citizenship, with right of abode, to the 3.25 million British subjects in Hong Kong and to help the rest find homes elsewhere, the idea being to keep people in Hong Kong by giving them the option to leave if conditions soured after 1997.  +
Not surprising given the rising unemployment rate in Britain, Thatcher’s government rejected this request, which the Chinese government would have considered an insult to its guarantees in the Joint Declaration.  +
In July 1989, Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe visited Hong Kong, where he discounted the possibility of granting full citizenship.  +
Instead, the British government reluctantly agreed to Governor David Wilson’s request to grant British citizenship to fifty thousand qualified people in important positions and their direct dependents for up to a total 225,000 Hong Kong residents.
英国官员、香港政府官员和当地商界领袖意识到，香港居民突然大规模外流可能会造成灾难性后果。因此，立法会和行政会议发起了“香港是我们的家”运动，要求英国政府给予在港325万英国公民完全的英国公民身份和居留权，并帮助其余居民在其他地方找到住所。其目的是为了让香港居民留在香港，并允许他们在1997年后局势恶化时选择离开。鉴于英国不断上升的失业率，撒切尔政府拒绝了这一请求，这并不令人意外。中国政府认为这是对《中英联合声明》中承诺的侮辱。1989年7月，外交大臣豪威访问香港，他否定了给予香港居民完全公民身份的可能性。最终，英国政府勉强同意了总督戴维·威尔逊的请求，给予五万名身居要职的合格人士及其直系亲属英国公民身份，总计最多可使22.5万香港居民获得英国公民身份。 +



Announced in December 1989, the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act offered full British nationality to fifty thousand such people and their families.  +
(With two-thirds from the private sector and one-third from the public sector, the number of people to be granted British citizenship was a compromise between the Foreign Office, which wanted as many as possible, and the Home Office, which wanted as few as possible.) The Chinese government accused the British of violating the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, insisting that it would not recognize these people as British citizens after 1997.  +
As it turned out, the nationality package drew considerably fewer applicants than the British and Hong Kong governments had expected, mainly because most people realized that the scheme was devised to convince them to stay in Hong Kong and because the PRC insisted that it would not honor the consular protection rights of the new passports.
1989年12月公布的《英国国籍（香港）法》向五万名香港居民及其家属授予英国国籍。（获准入籍的人数三分之二来自私营部门，三分之一来自公共部门，这是外交部（希望尽可能多的人入籍）和内政部（希望尽可能少的人入籍）之间达成的妥协。）中国政府指责英国违反了《中英联合声明》和《基本法》，并坚持1997年后不再承认这些人的英国公民身份。结果，该入籍计划的申请人数远低于英国和香港政府的预期，主要原因是大多数人意识到该计划旨在劝说他们留在香港，以及中国政府坚持不承认新护照持有者的领事保护权。 +



The Bill of Rights, enacted in June 1991, was another part of the British government’s attempt to restore confidence in Hong Kong.  +
The Chinese government opposed the bill from the outset, insisting that it violated the law and the spirit of the Joint Declaration and that the Basic Law already provided sufficient protection.  +
Local jurists disagreed, however, and in October 1989 Governor Wilson announced that the government would introduce a new Bill of Rights that would enshrine the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights; and the International Labour Conventions.  +
The Chinese understandably took the bill as an insult.  +
Not only did it question the sincerity of their promise to maintain Hong Kong’s existing economic and political systems, but the British had waited until the last decade of their rule in Hong Kong to introduce such a bill.  +
PRC officials now claimed the right to review and repeal all Hong Kong laws (including the Bill of Rights) that violated the Basic Law.
1991年6月颁布的《人权法案》是英国政府试图恢复香港民众信心的又一举措。中国政府从一开始就反对该法案，坚称其违反了《中英联合声明》的法律和精神，并认为《基本法》已提供了足够的保护。然而，香港本地法学家对此持不同意见。1989年10月，时任港督威尔逊宣布，政府将推出一部新的《人权法案》，将《公民权利和政治权利国际公约》、《经济、社会及文化权利国际公约》以及《国际劳工公约》的条款纳入其中。中国方面自然认为该法案是一种侮辱。这不仅质疑了英国政府维护香港现有经济和政治制度的承诺是否真诚，而且英国政府竟然在统治香港的最后十年才推出这样一部法案。如今，中国政府声称有权审查并废除所有违反《基本法》的香港法律（包括《人权法案》）。 +



Although the Chinese government was eager to restore confidence in Hong Kong after the Tiananmen Square Massacre and reiterated its promise that Hong Kong would not change after 1997, it condemned Hong Kong people for sending money to the striking students and accused them of helping the students try to overthrow the Chinese government.  +
Some PRC officials even referred to the Tiananmen Square demonstrations as a joint U.S.-Hong Kong plot.  +
The Chinese government also purged several local Communist groups that had supported the demonstrators and had participated in the Hong Kong protests.  +
On July 11, 1989, new CCP general secretary Jiang Zemin cautioned that “the well water does not interfere with the river water,” implying that since China would not try to introduce Socialism into Hong Kong after 1997, Hong Kong should not try to force democracy and capitalism into China, and warning Hong Kong people not to interfere in mainland politics.  +
On July 21, the People’s Daily condemned Martin Lee and Szeto Wah, the two founders of the Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China, for directing “subversive activities” against the Chinese government.  +
The Chinese government excluded Lee and Szeto from the Basic Law Drafting Committee (although this gave the two men even more support in Hong Kong) and urged the Hong Kong government to ban the alliance.  +
Although the Hong Kong government argued that such alliances were perfectly legal in Hong Kong, on October 23 William Ehrman, Hong Kong’s political advisor, assured Ji Shaoxiang, head of the New China News Agency Hong Kong branch’s foreign affairs department, that the Hong Kong government had “no intention of allowing Hong Kong to be used as a base for subversive activities” against China.
尽管中国政府在天安门事件后急于恢复香港民众的信心，并重申香港在 1997 年后不会改变，但它谴责香港民众向罢课学生捐款，并指责他们帮助学生试图推翻中国政府。一些中国官员甚至将天安门示威活动称为美港合谋。中国政府还清洗了几个支持示威者并参与香港抗议活动的本地共产党团体。1989 年 7 月 11 日，新任中共中央总书记江泽民告诫说，“井水不扰河水”，言下之意是，既然中国在 1997 年后不会试图在香港推行社会主义，香港也不应试图将民主和资本主义强加于中国，并警告香港民众不要干涉内地政治。 7 月 21 日， 《人民日报》 谴责“支持中国爱国民主运动联盟”的两位创始人李柱铭和司徒华，指责他们从事针对中国政府的“颠覆活动”。中国政府将李柱铭和司徒华排除在基本法起草委员会之外（尽管这反而使二人在香港获得了更多支持），并敦促香港政府取缔该联盟。尽管香港政府辩称此类联盟在香港完全合法，但 10 月 23 日，香港政务顾问威廉·埃尔曼向新华社香港分社外事部主任季绍祥保证，香港政府“绝不会允许香港被用作颠覆中国的基地”。 +



THE AIRPORT CONTROVERSY  机场争议
The Tiananmen Square Massacre undermined the already tenuous trust between the British and Chinese governments and harmed Sino-British relations for the next few years.  +
It also created an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion between the Hong Kong and Chinese governments.  +
In the fall of 1989, for example, a dispute arose over the case of Yang Yang, a Chinese swimmer who had sought asylum in Hong Kong and claimed to be a member of a prodemocracy organization in China.  +
When the Hong Kong government refused the Chinese government’s demand to repatriate Yang, the Chinese government refused to accept Chinese illegal immigrants arrested in Hong Kong.  +
This caused great anxiety in both Hong Kong, where many people feared that the news would encourage an influx of illegal immigrants, and in Guangdong, where officials worried that their province would be overrun by unemployed people from all over China en route to Hong Kong.
天安门事件破坏了英中两国政府间本已脆弱的信任，并在接下来的几年里损害了中英关系。它也加剧了香港与中国政府之间的不信任和猜忌。例如，1989年秋季，中国游泳运动员杨洋在香港寻求庇护，并声称自己是中国民主组织的成员，此事引发了争议。香港政府拒绝了中国政府遣返杨洋的要求，中国政府随即拒绝接收在香港被捕的中国非法移民。这在香港和广东都引起了极大的焦虑。香港民众担心这一消息会刺激非法移民涌入，而广东官员则担心来自全国各地前往香港的失业人员会涌入广东省。 +



The Yang incident faded from importance by late October, but tensions between the Hong Kong and Chinese governments were inflamed that month when Governor Wilson announced a plan to build a new airport and container port at Chek Lap Kok, off of Lantau Island.  +
The existing airport at Kai Tak in Kowloon could not be expanded, and Hong Kong had recently passed Rotterdam to become the world’s busiest container port.  +
The Port and Airport Development Strategy (PADS) project would cost almost HK$130 billion and would take until 2006 to complete, although the first stage (the airport) would be completed by 1997.  +
Wilson later denied such assertions, but many observers saw the project as an attempt to restore public confidence in Hong Kong’s future, especially since Wilson announced the project the same month that he initiated the process for drafting the Bill of Rights.
杨氏事件在十月下旬逐渐淡出人们的视线，但香港与中国政府之间的紧张关系却在当月因港督威尔逊宣布在香港大屿山附近的赤鱲角兴建新机场和集装箱港口而加剧。九龙启德机场已无法扩建，而香港近期超越鹿特丹，成为全球最繁忙的集装箱港口。港口及机场发展策略（PADS）项目耗资近 1300 亿港元，预计要到 2006 年才能完工，尽管第一阶段（机场）将于 1997 年竣工。威尔逊后来否认了这些说法，但许多观察人士认为，该项目旨在重塑公众对香港未来的信心，尤其是在他启动《人权法案》起草程序的同一个月，威尔逊就宣布了该项目。 +



In the wake of the Tiananmen Square Massacre, the PADS project almost immediately became a source of contention between Britain and China.  +
Insisting that it was supposed to be consulted on all policies that would affect post-1997 Hong Kong, the Chinese government saw the project as a clever scheme to make it pay for any construction not completed by 1997.  +
As Jiang Zemin put it, “You invite the guests, but I pay the bill.” On April 27, 1990, Guo Fengmin, the new Chinese head of the Joint Liaison Group, insisted that China be consulted on all major decisions.  +
In August Ji Pengfei, director of the Chinese State Council’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, asked Britain to send a delegation to Beijing to discuss the airport project.  +
The British government, which saw the airport as an internal economic issue that required no approval from either the British or the Chinese governments, accused China of withholding support as a way to force Britain to curb democratization in Hong Kong.  +
Still, in September 1990 Lord Caithness, British minister for Hong Kong, suddenly visited Hong Kong and declared that Beijing should be consulted on the airport project and ordered the Hong Kong government to provide information about the project to Chinese officials.
天安门事件后，港澳大桥机场项目几乎立即成为中英两国争论的焦点。中国政府坚持认为，所有影响1997年后香港的政策都必须征求其意见，并认为该项目是英国政府精心设计的阴谋，旨在让英国承担1997年之前未能完工的任何工程费用。正如江泽民所说，“你请客，我付账”。1990年4月27日，中英联委会新任中方负责人郭峰民坚持要求所有重大决策都必须征求中国的意见。同年8月，国务院港澳事务办公室主任季鹏飞要求英国派遣代表团前往北京，讨论港澳大桥机场项目。英国政府则认为港澳大桥机场项目属于英国国内经济事务，无需中英两国政府批准，并指责中国拒绝支持港澳大桥项目，以此迫使英国限制香港的民主化进程。然而，1990 年 9 月，英国香港事务大臣凯斯内斯勋爵突然访问香港，宣布应就机场项目咨询北京的意见，并命令香港政府向中国官员提供有关该项目的信息。 +



Even before the PRC airport delegation arrived, however, in October the Hong Kong government announced that the first stage of the project, the construction of the Lantau Bridge, would proceed as scheduled with public money.  +
After the Chinese government refused to endorse the project, Governor Wilson visited Beijing in January 1991 to discuss the airport project.  +
Wilson now stressed that the Hong Kong government was ready to be flexible and agreed on the need to consult China on any such projects transcending July 1997.  +
In April, British foreign secretary Douglas Hurd—the most senior British official to visit China after the Tiananmen Square Massacre—went to Beijing to discuss the airport project.  +
Finally, in June, Percy Cradock, foreign policy advisor to Prime Minister John Major, led a secret mission to Beijing to discuss the airport issue.  +
Meanwhile, Governor Wilson visited London, where he met with Major and other senior British officials.
然而，早在中华人民共和国机场代表团抵达之前，香港特区政府就于10月宣布，该项目的第一阶段——大屿山大桥的建设——将按计划使用公款进行。在中国政府拒绝批准该项目后，威尔逊总督于1991年1月访问北京，商讨机场项目。威尔逊强调，香港特区政府愿意保持灵活，并同意任何此类项目，凡在1997年7月之后进行的，均需与中国协商。4月，英国外交大臣道格拉斯·赫德——天安门事件后访问中国的最高级别英国官员——前往北京，商讨机场项目。最终，6月，英国首相约翰·梅杰的外交政策顾问珀西·克拉多克率领秘密代表团访问北京，商讨机场问题。与此同时，威尔逊总督访问伦敦，会见了梅杰和其他英国高级官员。 +



After more than a year and a half, an elaborate compromise was finally reached.  +
On June 30, 1991, Cradock initialed a memorandum of understanding with the Chinese, and on July 4 Wilson announced a Sino-British accord on the airport project: Hong Kong would pay for the first part of the project, a PRC official would participate in the planning and construction, British and Chinese foreign ministers would meet twice a year, and Prime Minister Major would visit China as a gesture of respect (making him the first major Western leader to visit China after the Tiananmen Square Massacre).  +
On September 3, 1991, Major went to Beijing, where he signed the Memorandum of Understanding with Premier Li Peng.  +
Although the memorandum eased tensions between Britain and China, many people in Hong Kong considered it an unnecessary concession that would give China excessive influence over Hong Kong’s finances before 1997.
经过一年半多的时间，双方最终达成了一项精心设计的妥协方案。1991年6月30日，克拉多克与中方草签了一份谅解备忘录；7月4日，威尔逊宣布了中英就机场项目达成的协议：香港将承担项目第一阶段的费用；一名中国官员将参与规划和建设；英中两国外长每年会晤两次；英国首相梅杰将访问中国以示尊重（这使他成为天安门事件后首位访问中国的西方主要领导人）。1991年9月3日，梅杰前往北京，与李鹏总理签署了谅解备忘录。尽管该备忘录缓和了英中之间的紧张关系，但许多香港人认为这是一项不必要的让步，会使中国在1997年之前对香港的财政拥有过大的影响力。 +



COPING WITH 1997  应对1997年
The people of Hong Kong had no say in the compromises between Britain and China following the Tiananmen Square Massacre.  +
One proposal, which the PRC government would have never accepted but which revealed the sense of frustration and helplessness in Hong Kong, called for urging China to lease the region to the United Nations for one hundred years.  +
Some observers even posited a connection between this sense of malaise and Hong Kong’s rising divorce rate, which doubled from 1983 to 1992.  +
And even if they did not worry about a brutal crackdown such as that at Tiananmen Square, many people justifiably worried that PRC officials simply did not understand Hong Kong well enough.  +
In 1988, Xu Jiatun, then sitting director of the Hong Kong branch of the New China News Agency, admitted that had he not lived and worked in Hong Kong for four years, he would have had the same ignorant views of capitalism as his comrades on the mainland.  +
In March 1995, Li Ruihan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese Politburo, admitted that Chinese leaders lacked an understanding of what had made Hong Kong so successful.  +
Li compared the recovery of Hong Kong with a story about a woman who had agreed to sell a hundred-year-old teapot that was famous for the tea it dispensed.  +
Not realizing that the tea’s flavor derived from the residue that had built up inside, she scrubbed and polished the teapot.  +
When the purchaser came to claim his teapot, he declared it worthless.  +
As Li explained, “if you don’t understand something, you are unaware of what makes it valuable and it will be difficult to keep it intact.”3
在天安门事件后，中英两国达成的妥协中，香港民众毫无发言权。其中一项提议——中国政府绝不会接受，却也暴露了香港民众的沮丧和无助——呼吁中国将香港租借给联合国一百年。一些观察人士甚至认为，这种不安情绪与香港不断攀升的离婚率有关，1983 年至 1992 年间，香港的离婚率翻了一番。即便他们并不担心会再次发生像天安门事件那样残酷的镇压，许多人也理所当然地担忧，中国官员对香港的了解还远远不够。1988 年，时任新华社香港分社社长的徐家屯承认，如果他没有在香港生活工作过四年，他对资本主义的看法也会像大陆的同僚一样无知。 1995 年 3 月，中共中央政治局常委李瑞涵承认，中国领导人对香港成功的原因缺乏了解。李瑞涵将香港的复兴比作一个故事：一位妇人同意出售一个百年老茶壶，这把茶壶因其盛出的茶汤而闻名。她并不知道茶汤的香味来自壶内积聚的沉淀物，于是她仔细地擦洗抛光了茶壶。当买家前来认领茶壶时，却说它一文不值。正如李瑞涵所解释的，“如果你不了解某样东西，你就不知道它的价值所在，也就很难好好保存它。” ³ +
The crackdown at Tiananmen Square and the uncertainty surrounding 1997 created such a panic that many Hong Kong people responded with two main strategies: by voting with their feet and by voting with the ballot.  +
Emigration was part of a longer-term pattern rather than just a reaction to the Tiananmen Square Massacre, but the number of emigrants rose dramatically from 40,000 in 1989 to 65,000 in 1990, cresting at 66,000 in 1992.  +
From 1984 to the eve of the transition, around 10 percent of Hong Kong’s population left—mainly for Australia, Canada, and the United States but also to Britain, New Zealand, and Singapore.  +
(When the Singapore government announced after the Tiananmen Square Massacre that it would allow 25,000 Hong Kong families to immigrate over the next five to eight years, more than 10,000 people showed up the next day at the Singapore consulate.) By the early 1990s, there were approximately 58,000 Hong Kong-born people in Australia, 500,000 in Canada, and 147,000 in the United States—mostly concentrated in large cities such as Sydney, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Vancouver, and Toronto.  +
And even though various British immigration acts from the 1960s to the 1980s slowed immigration to Britain, by the mid-1990s Chinese comprised the third-largest ethnic group in Britain.
天安门事件和1997年香港局势的动荡引发了恐慌，许多香港人采取了两种主要应对策略：用脚投票和用选票投票。移民潮并非仅仅是对天安门事件的反应，而是长期趋势的一部分，但移民人数从1989年的4万人急剧上升到1990年的6.5万人，并在1992年达到6.6万人的峰值。从1984年到过渡时期前夕，约有10%的香港人口离开香港——主要前往澳大利亚、加拿大和美国，也有部分前往英国、新西兰和新加坡。 （天安门事件后，新加坡政府宣布将在未来五到八年内允许25,000个香港家庭移民，第二天就有超过10,000人涌向新加坡领事馆。）到20世纪90年代初，澳大利亚约有58,000名香港出生的人，加拿大约有500,000名，美国约有147,000名——他们大多集中在悉尼、旧金山、洛杉矶、纽约、温哥华和多伦多等大城市。尽管从20世纪60年代到80年代，英国的各项移民法案减缓了移民英国的速度，但到20世纪90年代中期，华人已成为英国第三大族裔群体。 +



Although many emigrants returned after obtaining foreign citizenship, this mass emigration both expanded Hong Kong communities overseas and created two new types of family structures: astronaut households and parachute kids.  +
Also a Cantonese pun meaning a man with an absentee wife, the term “astronauts” refers to fathers who have moved their families but who continue to shuttle back and forth for business between Hong Kong and their new adoptive countries; parachute kids are the offspring of parents who have returned to Hong Kong but who leave their children overseas for safety.  +
Scholars have suggested that both arrangements complicate the idea of where home actually lies and demonstrate a reluctance to sever completely all ties with Hong Kong.  +
Perhaps the economic factor is even more important: these families quickly learned that they could not make as much money in their new adoptive countries as they could in Hong Kong.
尽管许多移民在获得外国国籍后返回香港，但这场大规模移民潮既扩大了香港海外社群的规模，也催生了两种新型家庭结构：宇航员家庭和空降子女。“宇航员”一词源于粤语双关，意指妻子不在身边的丈夫，指的是那些举家迁徙，但仍需往返于香港和新定居国之间经商的父亲；而“空降子女”则是指那些已返回香港，但为了子女安全而将他们留在海外的父母的孩子。学者们认为，这两种情况都模糊了“家”的概念，也体现了他们不愿与香港彻底断绝联系的意愿。或许经济因素更为重要：这些家庭很快意识到，他们在新的定居国的收入远不及在香港。 +



Even while the Tiananmen Square Massacre drove many people out of Hong Kong, it created a political awakening by bringing more people into local politics.  +
Although this new interest in politics was based on concern for the crackdown in Beijing, it also reflected fears about what the PRC authorities could do in Hong Kong after 1997.  +
According to a poll in February 1994, 58 percent of respondents were satisfied with the performance of the Hong Kong government, but only 29 percent were satisfied with the performance of the PRC government in China.  +
As sociologist Alvin So explains, the Tiananmen Square Massacre “led to an explosion in Hong Kong’s civil society.” All sorts of new civic organizations were founded, and student movements were revived.  +
After the Tiananmen Square Massacre, “the terms democracy and democrats became hegemonic in Hong Kong’s political discourse,” as even conservative businesspeople and pro-Beijing leftists changed their minds about democratization.4 The Tiananmen Square Massacre also helped strengthen the existing sense of Hong Kong identity.  +
It reminded many people that although they were ethnically Chinese, they did not identify with the Communist government of China.  +
“Hong Kong people,” argue political scientists Lynn White and Li Cheng, “became more fully Chinese in that year, even while their disaffection with the Chinese government soared and while they looked internationally for safe havens they might later need.”5
尽管天安门事件迫使许多人离开香港，但它也引发了一场政治觉醒，促使更多人参与到本地政治中来。虽然这种新的政治兴趣源于对北京镇压的担忧，但也反映了人们对 1997 年后中华人民共和国当局在香港可能采取的行动的恐惧。根据 1994 年 2 月的一项民意调查，58%的受访者对香港政府的表现感到满意，但只有 29%的受访者对中华人民共和国政府在中国大陆的表现感到满意。正如社会学家苏伟强（Alvin So）所解释的那样，天安门事件“引发了香港公民社会的爆发”。各种新的公民组织纷纷成立，学生运动也重新兴起。天安门事件之后，“ 民主” 和“ 民主人士 ”这两个词在香港的政治话语中占据主导地位，甚至连保守的商人和亲北京的左翼人士也改变了他们对民主化的看法。天安门事件也有助于强化香港原有的认同感。这让许多人意识到，尽管他们是华裔，但他们并不认同中国共产党政府。政治学家林恩·怀特和李成认为，“香港人在那一年更加彻底地认同了中国身份，即便他们对中国政府的不满情绪高涨，并且也在国际上寻找他们日后可能需要的安全避难所。” ⁵ +
After the Tiananmen Square Massacre, the British were under great local and international pressure to speed up Hong Kong’s democratization.  +
But China opposed the recommendation by the official members of the Executive and Legislative Councils for 50 percent of Hong Kong’s legislature to be directly elected by 1995 and 100 percent by 2003.  +
In January 1990, Governor Wilson convinced Premier Li Peng and other Chinese officials in Beijing that not increasing the number of directly elected Legislative Council members in 1991 would undermine public confidence in both the Hong Kong government and in Beijing’s post-1997 political plans.  +
As a compromise, the British agreed to allow eighteen directly elected Legislative Council seats in 1991, while China would allow twenty directly elected seats in the HKSAR council in 1997, twenty-four in 1999, and thirty by 2003.  +
In March 1991, more than 424,000 (32.5 percent of the electorate) voted in the District Board elections.  +
In May, more than 393,000 (23 percent of the electorate) voted in the Urban Council and Regional Council elections.  +
Although less than 40 percent (some 750,000 people) of registered voters turned out, the first direct elections to the Legislative Council, held in September 1991, showed many Hong Kong people’s feelings toward the PRC government.  +
The most important issue was the candidates’ reaction to the Tiananmen Square Massacre.  +
Prodemocracy candidates won as handily as all the pro-Beijing candidates lost.  +
The United Democrats—formed in 1990 and led by Martin Lee, Szeto Wah, Yeung Sum (a professor of social work), Ng Sung-man (a doctor), Lee Wing-tat (a teacher), Siu Yin-ying (a union leader), and Ng Ming-yum (an educator)—won twelve of the eighteen seats.
天安门事件后，英国面临着来自国内外的巨大压力，要求加快香港的民主化进程。但中国反对行政会议和立法会议正式成员提出的建议，即到1995年香港立法会50%的席位由直选产生，到2003年实现100%直选。1990年1月，港督威尔逊说服了国务院总理李鹏和其他北京官员，认为1991年不增加立法会直选议员的人数，将会削弱公众对香港政府以及北京1997年后政治计划的信心。作为妥协，英国同意在1991年设立18个立法会直选席位，而中国则同意在1997年设立20个香港特区议会直选席位，1999年增至24个，到2003年达到30个。1991年3月，超过42.4万人（占选民总数的32.5%）参加了区议会选举。同年5月，超过39.3万人（占选民总数的23%）参加了市议会和区域议会选举。尽管投票率不足40%（约75万人），但1991年9月举行的首次立法会直选反映了许多香港市民对中华人民共和国政府的看法。其中最重要的议题是候选人对天安门事件的反应。民主派候选人轻松获胜，而所有亲北京候选人则全部落败。成立于 1990 年的联合民主党由李柱铭、司徒华、杨森（社会工作教授）、吴松文（医生）、李永达（教师）、萧银英（工会领袖）和吴明郁（教育家）领导，赢得了 18 个席位中的 12 个。 +



The September 1991 elections were so humiliating to China that Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the PRC State Council, warned Governor Wilson not to appoint Martin Lee or Szeto Wah to the Executive Council.  +
Adding insult to injury, on October 1, the PRC’s National Day, most of the directly elected legislative councilors protested against China’s treatment of political prisoners.  +
Although in March 1992 Lu Ping encouraged Hong Kong people to become involved in local party politics, in June Guo Fengmin, the Chinese head of the Joint Liaison Group, opposed the possibility of Martin Lee being appointed to the Executive Council.  +
Wilson insisted that such appointments were the prerogative of the governor alone, but in deference to China none of the United Democrat leaders was invited to join the Executive Council.
1991年9月的选举对中国而言极其屈辱，以至于国务院港澳事务办公室主任陆平警告港督威尔逊不要任命李柱铭或司徒华进入行政会议。雪上加霜的是，10月1日，即中华人民共和国国庆日，大多数直选的立法会议员抗议中国对待政治犯的方式。尽管陆平在1992年3月鼓励香港市民积极参与本地政党政治，但同年6月，中共中央联络小组组长郭峰民反对任命李柱铭进入行政会议。威尔逊坚持认为此类任命是港督的专属权力，但出于对中国的尊重，没有邀请任何一位联合民主党领导人加入行政会议。 +



THE LAST IMPERIALIST: CHRIS PATTEN’S REFORMS
最后的帝国主义者：克里斯·帕滕的改革
Into this politically and emotionally charged atmosphere stepped the last colonial governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten.  +
Nicknamed “the last imperialist” because he had been sent to manage Britain’s withdrawal from its final major colony, Patten, when he arrived in the summer of 1992, made it clear from the start that he would be a different governor.  +
Not only did he dispense with the traditional governor’s uniform and regalia, but he was also the first Hong Kong governor to be a political appointee, having been given the post of governor by his friend John Major for helping the Conservative Party win the 1992 elections as chairman of the party (although he had lost his own seat in the House of Commons).
在这样充满政治和情感张力的氛围中，香港最后一任总督彭定康走马上任。由于他被派往香港管理英国从其最后一个主要殖民地撤离的事宜，因此被戏称为“最后的帝国主义者”。1992年夏天，彭定康抵达香港后，从一开始就表明他将是一位与众不同的总督。他不仅摒弃了传统的总督制服和徽章，而且还是首位由政治任命的香港总督。他的好友约翰·梅杰为了感谢他作为保守党主席帮助该党赢得1992年大选（尽管他本人在下议院失去了席位），将总督一职授予了他。 +



As a political appointee, Patten had more political clout than earlier governors.  +
In early October 1992 he announced a range of proposals for political reforms in 1994/1995 that would widen the electoral base of the functional constituencies and strengthen representation in the Legislative Council.  +
The reforms would include raising the number of directly elected Legislative Council seats from eighteen to twenty (in accordance with the Basic Law), eliminating all appointed seats to the Municipal Councils and District Boards, widening the electoral base of the twenty-one functional constituencies by replacing corporate voting with individual voting and adding nine new functional constituencies, combining multiple-seat geographic constituencies into single-seat constituencies, and reducing the voting age from twenty-one to eighteen (as in Britain and China).
作为政治委任官员，彭定康比以往的几位总督拥有更大的政治影响力。1992年10月初，他宣布了一系列将于1994/1995年度进行的政治改革方案，旨在扩大功能界别的选民基础，并加强立法会的代表性。这些改革包括：根据《基本法》，将立法会直选议席从18席增加到20席；取消市议会和区议会的所有委任议席；通过以个人投票取代团体投票并新增9个功能界别来扩大21个功能界别的选民基础；将多席位地理界别合并为单席位界别；以及将投票年龄从21岁降低到18岁（与英国和中国的做法相同）。 +



Given how long and hard the British had argued against political reform in Hong Kong, many critics—and not just in the PRC government—argued that Patten arrived in Hong Kong with a mandate from the British government to engineer an honorable withdrawal from Hong Kong, to curb anti-British feeling stemming from the uncertainty after the Tiananmen Square Massacre, and to help maintain British influence after 1997.  +
But Patten’s proposed reforms also reflected the desires of many liberal politicians in Hong Kong.  +
In May 1992, Martin Lee and Yeung Sum, chairman and vice chairman of the United Democrats, went to Britain, where they met with John Major and governor-designate Patten to discuss the possibility of increasing the number of directly elected seats in the 1995 election.  +
As Patten put it, he was trying to work within the “grey areas” in the Basic Law, giving Hong Kong people as much control over their own affairs as possible while ensuring certainty about Hong Kong’s post-1997 future.  +
“The reality,” argues Leo Goodstadt, “was that, by the late 1990s, it was obvious that without an expansion of the public’s participation in the process of government, the credibility of Hong Kong’s political institutions could not be maintained and there would be a crisis of governability.”6
鉴于英国长期以来极力反对香港政治改革，许多批评人士——不仅仅是中国政府内部人士——认为彭定康是受英国政府委托来到香港的，目的是促成英国体面地撤出香港，平息天安门事件后香港局势动荡引发的反英情绪，并帮助英国在 1997 年后维持其影响力。但彭定康提出的改革方案也反映了香港许多自由派政治家的愿望。1992 年 5 月，联合民主党主席李柱铭和副主席杨森前往英国，与英国首相约翰·梅杰和候任总督彭定康会面，讨论在 1995 年选举中增加直选议席的可能性。正如彭定康所说，他试图在《基本法》的“灰色地带”内开展工作，尽可能赋予香港市民对其自身事务的控制权，同时确保香港在 1997 年后的未来走向稳定。利奥·古德斯塔特认为，“现实情况是，到了 20 世纪 90 年代末，很明显，如果不扩大公众参与政府运作的程度，香港政治机构的公信力就无法维持，并将出现治理危机。” 6 +
Patten’s reforms were not as radical as he made them seem, for less than one-third of the Legislative Council would be elected directly.  +
But the reforms exceeded what China had in mind and broke with the (albeit rather new) practice of consulting with China over any political arrangements that would affect post-1997 Hong Kong.  +
The Chinese government, which distrusted Patten from the start, claimed that his proposals violated the Joint Declaration, the Basic Law, and the understanding between the British foreign secretary and the Chinese foreign minister in 1990.  +
Patten’s reforms made him very popular in Hong Kong, however, especially among ordinary people.  +
Although Beijing demanded that Patten be replaced, the British knew that doing so would hurt their prestige, not just in Hong Kong but also among the international community.  +
In March 1993, China agreed to negotiate with Britain over electoral arrangements for the 1994/1995 elections.  +
The Chinese were willing to lower the voting age but not to end the practice of appointing members to the Municipal Councils and District Boards, insisting that this should be a matter for the post-1997 government to decide.  +
The Chinese also wanted the continuation of corporate voting, since they wanted business and financial interests to be represented in the Legislative Council.  +
The Chinese accepted proposals for a single-seat, single-vote for the Municipal Councils and the District Boards, but they wanted to postpone plans for the Legislative Council.
彭定康的改革并不像他自己宣称的那样激进，因为立法会中只有不到三分之一的席位是直接选举产生的。但这些改革超出了中国的预期，并且打破了（尽管是相对较新的）就任何影响1997年后香港的政治安排与中国协商的惯例。中国政府从一开始就对彭定康抱有不信任，声称他的提议违反了《中英联合声明》、《基本法》以及1990年英国外交大臣和中国外交部长之间的谅解。然而，彭定康的改革使他在香港，尤其是在普通民众中，获得了极高的人气。尽管北京要求撤换彭定康，但英国方面知道，这样做不仅会损害其在香港的声誉，也会损害其在国际社会的声誉。1993年3月，中国同意与英国就1994/1995年选举的安排进行谈判。华人愿意降低选举年龄，但不愿取消委任市议会和区议会成员的做法，坚持认为这应由1997年后的政府决定。华人还希望继续实行企业投票，因为他们希望商业和金融利益在立法会中得到代表。华人接受了市议会和区议会实行一席一票制的提议，但希望推迟立法会的改革计划。 +



Despite seventeen rounds of negotiations, the two sides failed to reach an agreement.  +
After publishing the negotiations in a parliamentary white paper and insisting that their proposals were what Hong Kong people wanted, in November 1993 the British pushed through a modified version of Patten’s proposal, giving the PRC only a few days’ notice while hoping to continue the negotiations.  +
The PRC ended the negotiations and announced its “second stove” (the Chinese terms for setting up a new household) policy, insisting that all of Patten’s reforms would be replaced by new institutions after 1997.  +
The PRC also preemptively formed the Preliminary Working Committee to look into appointing the HKSAR Preparatory Committee to handle arrangements for Hong Kong after July 1, 1997.  +
Led by Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, all fifty-seven members of the Preliminary Working Committee either were from the PRC political machinery or were Hong Kong residents known for opposing Patten’s proposals.  +
The Chinese charged the British with being insincere and violating the Sino-British agreements and understandings, blaming them for the collapse of the negotiations.  +
With the support of the Legislative Council, which voted 32 to 24 in late June 1994 in favor of his proposals, Patten then decided to proceed unilaterally with his proposals for District Board and Municipal Council elections in 1994 and elections for the Legislative Council in 1995.  +
Beijing responded by declaring that the last Legislative Council elected under Patten’s reforms would be dissolved after the 1997 transition and replaced by the Provisional Legislative Council appointed by a four hundred-member selection committee.  +
This dashed any hopes for a through train of legislators who would serve through the transition until mid-1999.
尽管经过十七轮谈判，双方仍未能达成协议。英国在议会白皮书中公布了谈判结果，并坚称其方案符合香港人民的意愿。1993年11月，英国强行通过了彭定康方案的修改版，仅提前数日通知中华人民共和国，同时仍希望继续谈判。中华人民共和国终止了谈判，并宣布了“二炉”（中国术语，指建立新的家庭）政策，坚持彭定康的所有改革措施将在1997年后被新的机构取代。中华人民共和国还先发制人地成立了预备工作委员会，负责筹备香港特别行政区筹备委员会，以处理1997年7月1日之后香港的各项安排。该预备工作委员会由副总理兼外交部长钱其琛领导，其57名成员要么来自中华人民共和国的政治机器，要么是因反对彭定康方案而闻名的香港居民。中方指责英方缺乏诚意，违反了中英协议和谅解，并认为英方是导致谈判破裂的罪魁祸首。在立法会的支持下（1994年6月下旬，立法会以32票赞成、24票反对通过了彭定康的提案），彭定康决定单方面推进其提案，即1994年举行区议会和市议会选举，1995年举行立法会选举。北京方面则回应称，彭定康改革后产生的最后一届立法会将在1997年政权更迭后解散，取而代之的是由一个四百人遴选委员会任命的临时立法会。 这粉碎了任何希望，即通过立法者队伍的持续服务，直至 1999 年中期完成过渡。 +



Overlooking the earlier tensions after the Tiananmen Square Massacre and over the airport project, many critics blamed Patten for ending a decade of Sino-British understanding.  +
Patten’s supporters, however, insisted that Beijing was simply using his reforms to enhance its control over Hong Kong before the transition.  +
Both sides underestimated the complexity of Patten’s dilemma: he wanted to make the British look good and obtain the support of Hong Kong people by introducing democracy and to come off better than Wilson (who was seen by many in Hong Kong and Britain as having been too willing to give in to the PRC), all while trying to keep on good terms with the PRC government, which refused to believe that Patten could be sincere about political reform.  +
To make things worse for Patten, London suddenly tried to patch things up with Beijing in 1995 by withdrawing support for his reforms.
许多批评人士忽略了天安门事件后以及机场项目引发的早期紧张局势，将长达十年的中英友好关系终结归咎于彭定康。然而，彭定康的支持者则坚称，北京只是利用他的改革来加强对香港的控制，为过渡期做准备。双方都低估了彭定康所面临的困境：他既想通过引入民主来提升英国的形象，赢得香港人民的支持，又想比威尔逊（在香港和英国，许多人认为威尔逊过于轻易地向中华人民共和国妥协）做得更好；同时，他还试图与中国政府保持良好关系，而中国政府却始终不相信彭定康会真心实意地进行政治改革。更糟糕的是，伦敦在1995年突然试图通过撤回对彭定康改革的支持来修复与北京的关系。 +



Regardless, Patten’s proposals led to years of friction and mistrust between Beijing and London, with each side insisting that it had adhered to both the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.  +
Because Beijing was afraid that the Hong Kong democracy movement would revive the democracy movement on the mainland, it took a much stronger stance against Hong Kong’s democratic reforms than it had before the Tiananmen Square demonstrations.  +
Some Chinese officials saw Patten’s proposal not only as a violation of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law but also as an attempt to maintain British influence and even to help destabilize China by introducing democratization.  +
China also accused Britain of violating certain secret agreements that the British claimed they had never made.  +
Beijing came up with an anti-imperialist discourse not seen since the days of the Cultural Revolution, including colorful names for Patten—such as “liar,” “serpent,” “prostitute,” “two-headed snake,” “sinner of the millennium,” and “tango dancer”—for introducing democracy only after 150 years of colonialism and for violating the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.  +
It also supported the Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong, a local grassroots political group that had been established soon after Patten arrived in Hong Kong in 1992.
尽管如此，彭定康的提议导致北京和伦敦之间长达数年的摩擦和不信任，双方都坚称自己遵守了《中英联合声明》和《基本法》。由于北京担心香港的民主运动会重燃中国大陆的民主浪潮，因此对香港民主改革的立场比天安门事件前强硬得多。一些中国官员认为彭定康的提议不仅违反了《中英联合声明》和《基本法》，而且是英国试图通过推行民主化来维持自身影响力，甚至破坏中国稳定的举措。中国还指责英国违反了某些秘密协议，而英国则声称从未签署过这些协议。北京炮制出一套自文化大革命以来前所未见的反帝话语，给彭定康贴上了“骗子”、“毒蛇”、“妓女”、“双头蛇”、“千年罪人”、“探戈舞者”等各种侮辱性标签，指责他推行民主制度时距离香港结束150年的殖民统治仅一步之遥，并且违反了《中英联合声明》和《基本法》。北京还支持香港民主复兴联盟，这是一个在彭定康1992年抵达香港后不久成立的本地基层政治团体。 +



Although Sino-British relations improved somewhat after 1995, with agreements on the Court of Final Appeal and the new airport project, they were far from smooth.  +
After Qian Qichen visited Britain in October 1995, the British and Chinese foreign ministers agreed to work together on matters dealing with Hong Kong.  +
Patten pledged to help the Preparatory Committee and whoever was appointed to be the HKSAR’s chief executive.  +
Lu Ping, director of the PRC’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, visited Hong Kong in March 1996, while Anson Chan, Hong Kong’s chief secretary, went to Beijing the following month.  +
However, the two sides could not agree on arrangements for the handover ceremony in July 1997.  +
The Hong Kong government was reluctant to transfer certain information about government departments to the PRC.  +
It also steadfastly opposed the establishment of the provisional legislature, insisting that Hog Kong could not have two legislative bodies at once.
尽管1995年后中英关系有所改善，双方就终审法院和新机场项目达成协议，但进展远非一帆风顺。1995年10月钱其琛访问英国后，英中两国外交部长同意在香港事务上开展合作。彭定康承诺协助筹备委员会和新任香港特区行政长官。1996年3月，中华人民共和国国务院港澳事务办公室主任陆平访问香港，香港政务司司长陈方安生于次月访问北京。然而，双方未能就1997年7月的交接仪式安排达成一致。香港特区政府不愿向中华人民共和国移交某些政府部门信息，并坚决反对设立临时立法机构，坚持认为香港不能同时存在两个立法机构。 +



When Beijing and London began working together directly to plan for the 1997 transition, Chris Patten became gradually marginalized.  +
(Percy Cradock called this the “spectacle of the incredible shrinking governor.”) Nevertheless, his reforms had several important effects in Hong Kong.  +
They benefited the prodemocracy forces since the Democrats controlled almost half of the Legislative Council seats after 1995.  +
Patten’s proposals led to conflict between Britain and China, but they also represented the desires of many Hong Kong people, which could be seen in the results of the Legislative Council elections of 1995.  +
In September, 36 percent of Hong Kong’s registered voters turned out, many of them voting against candidates seen as being pro-Beijing, such as the Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong.  +
Pro-Beijing candidates won only sixteen out of sixty seats.  +
Martin Lee’s Democratic Party, despite its electoral successes, did not win power, but prodemocracy candidates such as Lee, Szeto Wah, Lau Chin-shek, and Emily Lau became the most popular members of the Legislative Council.
当北京和伦敦开始直接合作规划1997年的过渡时，克里斯·帕滕逐渐被边缘化。（珀西·克拉多克称之为“总督地位急剧下降的奇观”。）尽管如此，他的改革对香港产生了若干重要影响。这些改革使民主派受益，因为民主党在1995年后控制了立法会近一半的席位。帕滕的提议引发了英国和中国之间的冲突，但也代表了许多香港人的愿望，这在1995年的立法会选举结果中可见一斑。9月，香港登记选民的投票率为36%，其中许多人投票反对被视为亲北京的候选人，例如香港民建联。亲北京候选人在60个席位中仅赢得16个。尽管李柱铭领导的民主党在选举中取得了成功，但并未赢得政权，而李柱铭、司徒华、刘进石和刘慧玲等民主派候选人则成为立法会中最受欢迎的成员。 +



On the one hand, Patten’s reforms increased political participation through regular channels so dramatically that “voting had become a socially acceptable behavior.”7 On the other hand, the reforms promoted a contested democracy since Beijing, irate at Patten for violating the Joint Declaration, appointed prominent businesspeople as local advisors to the Preliminary Working Committee.  +
In late January 1996, Beijing established the Hong Kong Preparatory Committee, as stipulated in the Basic Law.  +
Led by Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, the committee consisted of 150 members (56 from the mainland and 94 from Hong Kong).  +
Many of the Hong Kong members were businessmen known for being pro-Beijing; 28 came from political parties or political groups such as the New Hong Kong Alliance, the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance, the Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong, the Liberal Democratic Foundation, and the Association for Democracy and People’s Livelihood.  +
Most of the Hong Kong people were members of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (the PRC’s main political advisory board) and the National People’s Congress.  +
The most glaring absence was that of the Democratic Party, even though it was the largest political party in the Legislative Council: Martin Lee’s criticism of Beijing and support for Patten’s reforms led Beijing to exclude his party from the committee.
一方面，彭定康的改革极大地提高了民众通过正规渠道参与政治的程度，以至于“投票成为一种社会认可的行为”。 7 另一方面，由于北京方面对彭定康违反《中港联合声明》感到愤怒，并任命知名商界人士担任香港筹备工作委员会的本地顾问，这些改革也助长了一种充满争议的民主。1996 年 1 月下旬，北京根据《基本法》的规定成立了香港筹备委员会。该委员会由国务院副总理兼外交部长钱其琛领导，共有 150 名成员（56 名来自内地，94 名来自香港）。许多香港成员是亲北京的商界人士；28 名成员来自政党或政治团体，例如新香港联盟、香港进步联盟、香港民主复兴联、自由民主基金会和民主民生协会。大多数香港人都是中国人民政治协商会议（中华人民共和国的主要政治咨询机构）和全国人民代表大会的成员。最引人注目的是民主党的缺席，尽管它是立法会最大的政党：马丁·李对北京的批评以及对彭定康改革的支持导致北京将他的政党排除在委员会之外。 +



In November 1996, the Preparatory Committee formed a four hundred-member Selection Committee to pick the HKSAR’s first chief executive and the Provisional Legislative Council.  +
This committee was also overwhelmingly big business (including heavyweights such as Li Ka-shing, Walter Kwok, Gordon Wu, Stanley Ho, and Lee Shau-kee).  +
In December, the Selection Committee created an unelected provisional legislature for after June 30, 1997, drawing protests from both the Hong Kong and British governments.  +
The Preparatory Committee tried to make this provisional body look like a Hong Kong Legislative Council: more than half of the sixty members were on the pre-existing Legislative Council (four members of the Association for Democracy and People’s Livelihood were included, although no one from Martin Lee’s Democratic Party was).  +
However, ten of the defeated pro-PRC candidates from the 1995 elections were appointed to the provisional council, while 85 percent of the appointees were on the Selection Committee.  +
When a Hong Kong member of the Preparatory Committee voted against establishing the provisional legislature, Chinese officials declared that he would be barred from that committee as well as from the committee for selecting the chief executive of post-1997 Hong Kong.
1996年11月，筹备委员会成立了一个由400名成员组成的遴选委员会，负责遴选香港特别行政区首任行政长官和临时立法会。该委员会成员几乎全部来自商界（包括李嘉诚、郭台铭、吴钊燮、何鸿燊和李兆基等重量级人物）。同年12月，遴选委员会设立了一个未经选举产生的临时立法机构，任期自1997年6月30日起，此举引发了香港和英国政府的抗议。筹备委员会试图将这个临时机构打造成香港立法会：60名成员中超过半数来自原立法会（包括四名民主民生协会成员，但李柱铭领导的民主党成员却无人入选）。然而，1995年选举中落败的亲中候选人中有十人被任命为临时立法会议员，而85%的被任命者进入了遴选委员会。当一名香港籍筹备委员会成员投票反对设立临时立法会时，中国官员宣布，他将被禁止进入筹备委员会以及遴选1997年后香港行政长官的委员会。 +



Patten’s reforms may have also prompted Beijing to take a tougher approach to Hong Kong and to show that it would not tolerate criticism and dissent.  +
In August 1994, the Chinese government closed down the Beijing branch of Giordano, a chain of clothing stores owned by colorful Hong Kong entrepreneur Jimmy Lai.  +
Also the founder of Next Magazine, Hong Kong’s best-selling weekly, Lai had routinely criticized the PRC leadership, even calling Premier Li Peng “a turtle’s egg with a zero IQ” and “a national shame.” The reforms also fueled the general sense of uncertainty that pervaded Hong Kong in the mid-1990s.  +
There was a serious concern about whether upper-level civil servants would be able to keep their posts after 1997, especially those who had supported Patten’s proposals.  +
And rather than helping Britain make an honorable withdrawal from Hong Kong, the reforms drew attention to its historical failures.  +
In October 1996, for example, Lee Cheuk-yan, a Legislative Council member known for his anti-Beijing views, criticized the British for waiting so long to introduce democracy.
彭定康的改革或许也促使北京对香港采取更强硬的立场，表明其不容忍批评和异议。1994 年 8 月，中国政府关闭了佐丹奴（Giordano）在北京的分店。佐丹奴是一家连锁服装店，由香港著名企业家黎智英（Jimmy Lai）所有。黎智英同时也是香港最畅销周刊《壹周刊 》的创办人，他经常批评中华人民共和国领导层，甚至称李鹏总理是“智商为零的龟蛋”和“国耻”。这些改革也加剧了 20 世纪 90 年代中期弥漫在香港的普遍不确定感。人们严重担忧，1997 年后，高级公务员能否保住职位，尤其是那些支持彭定康改革方案的人。而且，这些改革非但没有帮助英国体面地撤出香港，反而凸显了英国历史上的失败。例如，1996 年 10 月，以反北京立场著称的立法会议员李卓人批评英国迟迟不引入民主制度。 +



THE RACE FOR HKSAR CHIEF EXECUTIVE
香港特区行政长官竞选
With the Provisional legislative Council selected, in December 1996 Premier Li Peng appointed Tung Chee-hwa, a former shipping magnate, as the chief executive who would run Hong Kong after the transition.  +
The selection process for chief executive had not been democratic, but it was designed to involve the entire Hong Kong community, with the candidates meeting all the main political parties and interest groups.  +
Interviews with the Selection Committee were broadcast on television and viewed widely.  +
The campaign also showed how many of the same elites who had previously urged the British to try to hold on to Hong Kong changed their allegiance after the Joint Declaration in 1984.  +
T.  +
S.  +
Lo (son of Eurasian lawyer Lo Man Kam), who started going by his Chinese name, Lo Tak-shing, took a PRC passport in the early 1990s and gave up his British citizenship and his title of Commander of the British Empire.  +
When Lo, whose popularity rating was only around 1 percent, withdrew, Simon Li, former justice and director of the Bank of East Asia (and nephew of Li Tse-fong, whom we met in chapter 5), entered the race.  +
Li supported the Provisional Legislative Council and tightening public security to maintain Hong Kong’s stability and prosperity.  +
Chief Justice Ti-liang Yang, who gave up his British knighthood, warned against challenging the PRC’s supremacy.  +
Peter Woo, son-in-law of late shipping tycoon Y.  +
K.  +
Pao, checked with Beijing before announcing his intention to run.
1996年12月，临时立法会选出后，李鹏总理任命前航运巨头董建华为香港特首，负责过渡后香港的治理。特首的遴选过程并非民主，但旨在让整个香港社会参与其中，候选人需与所有主要政党和利益集团会面。遴选委员会的面试过程通过电视播出，广为人知。此次选举也揭示了许多曾敦促英国试图留住香港的精英人士，在1984年《中英联合声明》发表后改变了立场。卢德胜（欧亚混血律师卢文锦之子），在20世纪90年代初开始使用中文名卢德胜，并申请了中华人民共和国护照，放弃了英国国籍和大英帝国司令勋章。卢惠珍（支持率仅约1%）退出竞选后，前法官、东亚银行董事李思远（我们在第五章中提到的李泽頓的侄子）接替了他的位置。李思远支持临时立法会，并主张加强公共安全以维护香港的稳定与繁荣。放弃英国爵位的首席大法官杨体良警告不要挑战中华人民共和国的至高无上地位。已故航运巨头包玉刚的女婿胡锦涛在宣布参选意向前，曾与北京方面进行过沟通。 +



The selection of Tung, who won 80 percent of the votes, surprised no one.  +
Many pundits had considered his selection a done deal when Chinese president and CCP general secretary Jiang Zemin singled him out for an exceptionally cordial handshake at an earlier meeting in Beijing.  +
While many critics, particularly in the Western media, scoffed at Tung’s lack of political experience and dismissed him as a Beijing lackey, some Chinese leaders and pro-Beijing forces in Hong Kong were concerned about his political reliability (he had old family connections with Taiwan).  +
The American press in particular dismissed him as Beijing’s man, but, as local journalist Frank Ching argued on the eve of the handover, all colonial governors had been appointed by London, without any consultation with Hong Kong people; at least Tung’s appointment involved some consultation with Hong Kong people.8
董建华以 80%的得票率当选，这并不令人意外。许多评论人士认为，早在之前北京的一次会晤中，中国国家主席兼中共中央总书记江泽民就曾与董建华进行了格外友好的握手，因此董建华的当选已成定局。尽管许多批评人士，尤其是西方媒体，嘲笑董建华缺乏政治经验，并斥责他是北京的走狗，但一些中国领导人和香港亲北京势力却对他的政治可靠性表示担忧（他与台湾有着家族渊源）。美国媒体尤其认为他是北京的傀儡，但正如香港记者程峰在香港回归前夕所指出的那样，所有殖民地总督都是由伦敦任命的，并未与香港人民进行任何协商； 至少董建华的任命还与香港人民进行了一些磋商。 +



Born in Shanghai, Tung was educated there and in Hong Kong and Britain and worked in the United States in the 1960s.  +
Although his father had been driven out of China after the 1949 revolution and went to Hong Kong, where he built a shipping empire that his son would inherit, he sent his son to a pro-Beijing school in Hong Kong.  +
The younger Tung had old ties to the PRC government, for the Bank of China had helped rescue his firm, Orient Overseas, from bankruptcy in the 1980s.  +
He had been a member of the Consultative Committee for the Basic Law Drafting Committee and had been nominated to the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Committee by the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and by the New China News Agency local branch.  +
He also had considerable business and political experience in Hong Kong.  +
Although he was not widely known until the campaign in late 1996, he was among the first group of Hong Kong advisors chosen by Beijing in 1992 and became a member of Patten’s Executive Council the same year after the PRC government recommended Tung indirectly (although he ultimately resigned from this position to avoid any conflict of interest with his position on the Preparatory Committee).
董建华出生于上海，先后在上海、香港和英国接受教育，并于20世纪60年代在美国工作。尽管他的父亲在1949年辛亥革命后被迫离开中国，前往香港并建立起庞大的航运帝国（后由其子继承），但他仍将儿子送入香港一所亲北京的学校就读。董建华与中国政府有着长期的联系，因为中国银行曾在20世纪80年代帮助他旗下的东方海外公司摆脱破产危机。他曾是《基本法》起草委员会咨询委员会成员，并由香港事务办公室和新华社香港分社提名进入中国人民政治协商会议。此外，他在香港也拥有丰富的商业和政治经验。虽然直到 1996 年底的竞选活动他才广为人知，但他是 1992 年北京挑选的第一批香港顾问之一，同年在中华人民共和国政府间接推荐董建华后成为彭定康行政会议成员（尽管他最终辞去了这一职务，以避免与他在筹备委员会的职位产生任何利益冲突）。 +



Shortly after his selection as chief executive and while Patten was still governor, Tung appointed his Executive Council designed to satisfy both Hong Kong people and PRC interests, partly by retaining two members of Patten’s Executive Council.  +
By not including any of the Democrats on his council, however, Tung prompted complaints that the new Executive Council was no different from the old colonial one.  +
He also drew fire for supporting Chinese proposals to limit political expression in Hong Kong.  +
Frequently emphasizing social order when talking about civil liberties, Tung consistently defended his attitudes toward public demonstrations and protests in Hong Kong by invoking his memories of protests in the United States, where he “saw what happened with the slow erosion of authority” as “society became less orderly than is desirable.” Throughout his campaign for chief executive, he had insisted that Hong Kong people cared more about housing and education than about politics and protests.  +
He had warned that freedom of expression might have to be sacrificed in order to prevent international forces from interfering in the handover.  +
He was also criticized for opposing foreign donations to local political parties, even though he had donated heavily to the British Conservative Party in the 1992 general election.
董建华当选行政长官后不久，在彭定康仍担任港督期间，便组建了行政委员会，旨在兼顾香港市民和中华人民共和国的利益，其中一项举措是保留了彭定康行政委员会的两名成员。然而，董建华的行政委员会中没有民主党成员，这引发了外界的批评，认为新行政委员会与旧殖民地行政委员会并无二致。他还因支持中国限制香港政治表达的提议而饱受诟病。董建华在谈及公民自由时，经常强调社会秩序，并始终援引他在美国的经历来为自己对待香港公众示威和抗议的态度辩护。他声称，在美国，“随着权威的逐渐瓦解”，社会秩序变得不如预期。在竞选行政长官期间，他一直坚称香港市民更关心住房和教育，而非政治和抗议。他还警告说，为了防止国际势力干预香港回归，言论自由可能不得不做出牺牲。他还因反对外国向地方政党捐款而受到批评，尽管他在 1992 年大选中曾向英国保守党捐赠了大量资金。 +



THE COUNTDOWN ENDS  倒计时结束
At 8:00 P.M.  +
on June 30, 1997, the most expensive fireworks display in all of history exploded over Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbour.  +
Shortly afterward, as four thousand guests sat down to an elegant banquet at the newly built harbor-front Convention Centre in Wanchai, troops of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) crossed the border to assume their positions in the Hong Kong garrison.  +
Led by Charles, Prince of Wales and heir to the British throne, the British delegation to the handover ceremony included Prime Minister Tony Blair, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, Governor Chris Patten, and General Charles Guthrie, chief of the British General Staff.  +
On the Chinese side sat President Jiang Zemin (Deng Xiaoping had died earlier that year), Premier Li Peng, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, PLA chief and vice chairman of the Central Military Commission General Zhang Wannian, and Tung Chee-hwa.  +
Among the guests were representatives from all over the world.  +
In what a Guangzhou newspaper described as “the battle of the century for the Chinese and foreign media,” thousands of journalists came to cover this historic occasion and the festivities surrounding it.  +
Accompanied by renowned French-born, Chinese American cellist Yo-Yo Ma and a children’s choir from the mainland, the Hong Kong Philharmonic played Symphony 1997, written specially for the handover by mainland composer Tan Dun.
1997年6月30日晚8点，历史上最昂贵的烟火表演在香港维多利亚港上空绽放。不久之后，四千名宾客在湾仔新建的海滨会展中心就座，享用盛大的宴会。与此同时，中国人民解放军部队越过边境，进驻香港。由英国王位继承人威尔士亲王查尔斯率领的英国代表团出席了交接仪式，成员包括首相托尼·布莱尔、外交大臣罗宾·库克、总督克里斯·帕滕以及英国总参谋长查尔斯·格思里将军。中方出席的有国家主席江泽民（邓小平于当年早些时候逝世）、国务院总理李鹏、国务院副总理兼外交部长钱其琛、解放军总司令兼中央军委副主席张万年上将以及董建华。出席仪式的宾客中还有来自世界各地的代表。广州一家报纸称之为“中外媒体世纪之战”，数千名记者前来报道这一历史性时刻及其相关庆祝活动。香港管弦乐团携手著名法裔美籍华裔大提琴家马友友和来自中国大陆的童声合唱团，演奏了由中国大陆作曲家谭盾专门为回归创作的《1997交响曲》。 +



After the colonial Hong Kong flag was lowered at 11:30 P.M., Prince Charles began his speech, much of which dealt with the guarantees enshrined in the 1984 Sino-British Declaration.  +
The prince explained that Hong Kong’s “dynamism and stability” had made its economy “the envy of the world” and had shown how “East and West can live and work together.” The “solemn pledges made before the world in the 1984 Joint Declaration,” declared Prince Charles, would “guarantee the continuity of Hong Kong’s way of life.” He promised that Britain would “maintain its unwavering support for the Joint Declaration.” As midnight and the end of British rule drew near, the prince promised the people of Hong Kong that “we shall not forget you, and we shall watch with the closest interest as you embark on this new era of your remarkable history.”9
晚上 11 点 30 分，香港殖民地旗帜降下后，查尔斯王子开始了他的演讲，演讲内容主要围绕 1984 年《中英联合声明》中所载的各项保证展开。王子解释说，香港的“活力与稳定”使其经济“令世界艳羡”，并展现了“东西方如何和谐共处、携手合作”。查尔斯王子宣称，1984 年《联合声明》中向世界作出的“庄严承诺”将“保障香港生活方式的延续”。他承诺英国将“坚定不移地支持《联合声明》” 。 午夜将至，英国统治即将结束，王子向香港人民承诺：“我们不会忘记你们，我们将密切关注你们开启这段非凡历史的新篇章。” +
At midnight, July 1, the British flag was lowered and the Chinese flag raised, accompanied by the new flag of the Hong Kong SAR, emblazoned with a bauhinia flower, the official symbol of the new SAR.  +
Approximately half a mile away, the camp commander of the British Forces headquarters in Hong Kong turned over the building to the PLA.  +
President Jiang Zemin, the first PRC leader to visit Hong Kong, declared that July 1, 1997, would “go down in the annals of history as a day that merits eternal memory.” Jiang explained that the “return of Hong Kong to the motherland after going through a century of vicissitudes indicates that from now on, the Hong Kong compatriots have become true masters of this Chinese land and that Hong Kong has now entered a new era of development.” He promised that the PRC government would “unswervingly” abide by the one country, two systems concept.10
7 月 1 日午夜，英国国旗降下，中国国旗升起，同时升起的还有香港特别行政区的新旗帜，旗帜上绘有紫荆花，这是新特区的官方象征。大约半英里外，驻港英军司令部营地指挥官将大楼移交给中国人民解放军。首位访问香港的中华人民共和国主席江泽民宣布，1997 年 7 月 1 日将“作为值得永远铭记的历史性一天”。江泽民解释说，“香港历经百年沧桑回归祖国，标志着香港同胞从此成为这片中国土地的真正主人，香港也从此进入了发展的新时代。”他承诺，中华人民共和国政府将“坚定不移”地坚持“ 一国两制 ”方针。 +



In his inaugural speech, Tung Chee-hwa, the first Chinese to administer Hong Kong in more than 150 years, declared that “for the first time in history, we, the people of Hong Kong, will be master of our own destiny.” Stressing how “Hong Kong and China are whole again,” Tung reassured his new constituency and the world that “we value this empowerment and we will exercise our powers prudently and responsibly.”11 Shortly after the handover ceremony, the British delegation left the former colony on the Royal Yacht Britannia and on HMS Chatham.  +
As Patten and his family waved farewell to the crowds assembled at the dock, the Royal Marines band played “Rule Britannia” and “Land of Hope and Glory.” In a display of military might not seen since the celebrations for Queen Elizabeth’s coronation in 1953, early in the morning of July 1 four thousand troops and twenty personnel carriers of the PLA crossed the border.  +
Other troops arrived by helicopters and naval ships.
在就职演说中，150 多年来首位执掌香港的华人董建华宣布：“历史上第一次，我们香港人民将掌​​握自己的命运。”他强调“香港与中国再次统一”，并向他的新选民和全世界保证，“我们珍视这一权力，并将审慎负责地行使权力。” 11 交接仪式结束后不久，英国代表团乘坐皇家游艇“不列颠尼亚”号和“查塔姆”号军舰离开这片前殖民地 。 彭定康及其家人向聚集在码头的民众挥手告别时，皇家海军陆战队乐队奏响了《统治吧，不列颠尼亚》和《希望与荣耀的土地》。7 月 1 日清晨，解放军四千名士兵和二十辆装甲运兵车越过边境，展现了自 1953 年伊丽莎白女王加冕庆典以来最壮观的军事实力。其他部队乘坐直升机和海军舰艇抵达。 +



Like any historical event, the handover meant something different to the various parties involved.  +
For Britain, it marked the end of what had once been the world’s greatest empire, by now limited mainly to Gibraltar and a dozen or so small islands scattered across the oceans of the world.  +
“Under menacing monsoon skies,” the BBC television news reported on June 30, “Hong Kong woke up to its final day of British rule and to an appointment with uncertain destiny.”12 In a rain-drenched, emotional ceremony held on June 30 at the former British naval base, Patten declared the day a “cause for celebration not for sorrow.” Emphasizing Hong Kong’s “promise” and “unshakeable destiny,” he insisted that “the story of this great city is about the years before this night and the years of success that will surely follow it.”13 Royal Marines bandsmen in white tropical uniforms lined up with kilted pipers from the Black Watch and the Scottish Division and with musicians from the Gurkhas and the Scots Guards for one final tattoo.  +
Thousands of spectators watched members of the British Army, the Royal Air Force, and the Royal Navy march before Prince Charles, Patten, and other British representatives.  +
As the rain came down, the Union Jack was lowered.  +
Conspicuously missing from this ceremony was Tung Chee-hwa, who was greeting President Jiang Zemin.  +
Tung had insisted before the ceremony that his absence should not be considered a slight to the British, but it nonetheless symbolized Hong Kong’s new political status.  +
And instead of driving three times round the driveway of Government House—an old tradition signifying that a colonial governor would return—this time Patten’s limousine did not make a third circuit.
如同任何历史事件一样，香港回归对各方而言意义各不相同。对英国而言，这标志着曾经的世界最大帝国的终结，如今其疆域主要局限于直布罗陀和散布在世界各大洋上的十几个小岛。“在季风暴雨的阴云下，”英国广播公司（BBC）电视新闻在 6 月 30 日报道，“香港迎来了英国统治的最后一天，也迎来了充满未知命运的一天。” 12 在 6 月 30 日于前英国海军基地举行的雨中动情仪式上，彭定康宣布这一天“值得庆祝，而非悲伤”。他强调香港的“希望”和“不可动摇的命运”，并坚称“这座伟大城市的故事，不仅在于今晚之前的岁月，更在于今晚之后必将到来的辉煌岁月。” 13 名身着白色热带制服的皇家海军陆战队乐队成员与身着苏格兰裙的黑卫队和苏格兰师风笛手，以及廓尔喀人和苏格兰卫队的乐手们列队，进行最后的致敬仪式。数千名观众观看英国陆军、皇家空军和皇家海军的成员在查尔斯王子、彭定康和其他英国代表面前列队行进。随着雨水落下，英国国旗缓缓降下。值得注意的是，董建华并未出席此次仪式，他原本是去迎接江泽民主席的。董建华在仪式前曾强调，他的缺席并非对英国的怠慢，但这仍然象征着香港新的政治地位。此外，彭定康的座驾也没有像往常那样绕行政府大楼车道三圈——这是殖民地总督即将返回的古老传统——这次也没有进行第三圈。 +



Yet the handover had also brought Britain a new sense of prestige and respect.  +
In the years counting down to 1997, the British, who had not introduced political representation until late in their rule in Hong Kong, were magically transformed—particularly in the Western media—into stalwarts of democratic reform, especially compared to the PRC regime.  +
Any concerns about the colonial government’s history of racial discrimination and lack of political representation were lost in the self-congratulatory assurances that had Hong Kong not become such a prosperous place under the British, the PRC might never have wanted it back in the first place.  +
The BBC report praised Hong Kong as “Britain’s legacy, a free market low-tax paradise, the perfect marriage of Chinese energy and benign British administration.”14 Mike Chinoy, Hong Kong bureau chief for news network CNN, noted that American news coverage of the PLA troops marching into Hong Kong “really gave the impression that the butchers of Beijing were arriving,” ignoring the “thousands of happy residents in the New Territories who welcomed the PLA.”15
然而，香港回归也为英国带来了新的声望和尊重。在 1997 年回归前的几年里，英国——直到其统治香港后期才引入政治代表权——神奇地摇身一变，尤其是在西方媒体的宣传中，成为民主改革的坚定拥护者，尤其与中华人民共和国政权相比更是如此。任何关于殖民政府种族歧视历史和缺乏政治代表权的担忧，都被英国自鸣得意的保证所掩盖：如果香港在英国统治下没有发展得如此繁荣，中华人民共和国或许根本就不会想要收回香港。英国广播公司（BBC）的报道盛赞香港是“英国的遗产，一个自由市场、低税收的天堂，是中国活力与英国仁慈管理的完美结合”。 14 美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）香港分社社长迈克·奇诺伊指出，美国媒体对解放军开进香港的报道“给人一种北京的刽子手到来的印象”，却忽略了“新界成千上万欢迎解放军的居民” 。15 +

A huge diplomatic, national, and psychological victory over the unequal treaties imposed by the Western powers in the mid-1800s, the recovery of Hong Kong was a major event in modern Chinese history.  +
Newspapers and posters throughout China celebrated the end of “a century of shame.” The front page of the July 1 edition of the China Daily, the PRC’s official international English-language newspaper, read “Home at Last,” with the handover photo cropped so that it centered on the Chinese delegation and omitted Patten.  +
In a ninety-seven-page special issue that the Guangzhou Daily promised would become a collector’s item, the newspaper declared that the handover was “time for the Chinese nation to wash away one hundred years of shame and feel proud and elated!” The newspaper predicted that July 1 would “draw attention from all over the world, and be inscribed in history books forever.”
香港的回归是中国近代史上的一件大事，它不仅是对西方列强在 19 世纪中期强加于中国的不平等条约的巨大外交、民族和心理胜利。全国各地的报纸和海报都在庆祝“百年耻辱”的终结。《 中国日报 》是中华人民共和国官方英文报纸，其 7 月 1 日的头版标题为“终于回家了”，交接照片经过裁剪，以中国代表团为中心，而彭定康则被省略。《 广州日报 》在其长达 97 页的特刊中宣称，香港回归是“中华民族洗刷百年耻辱、感到自豪和喜悦的时刻！”该报预测，7 月 1 日将“吸引全世界的目光，并永远载入史册”。 +



The historic nature and political urgency of the transition was inscribed in the Hong Kong Clock, a gigantic clock installed by the PRC government in 1994 at the entrance to the Museum of Revolutionary History, in the middle of Tiananmen Square, to count down the days, hours, minutes, and seconds to the return of Hong Kong.  +
This placement of the clock, argued China scholar Michael Yahuda in 1996, “was done as a public reminder to the people of Hong Kong that they were due to be embraced by the motherland under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party before too long.” Yet the clock was also ticking for Beijing, for by placing the clock in “a place of such symbolic meaning,” the PRC government “elevated the significance of the transfer to a matter of national pride and significance.” Not only was the clock a warning to the people of Hong Kong that their time under colonial rule was almost up, it became “a graphic reminder that the resumption of sovereignty and taking this new step towards national reunification involved matters of the highest prestige that the new leaders would have to manage well and manage soon.”16 As art historian Wu Hung wrote in spring 1997, the clock was “a political statement as well as Beijing’s threatening gesture to Hong Kong.” A “political timer,” the clock warned people in Hong Kong against using democracy as a pretext for trying to subvert Communism in China and “sharply demarcated” Hong Kong’s “two alternative identities”—a “foreign colony” or an “integral part of the socialist motherland”—denying it the possibility of a third, alternative identity of its own.17
香港回归的历史意义和政治紧迫性在香港大钟上得到了充分体现。这座巨大的时钟由中华人民共和国政府于 1994 年安装在天安门广场中央的革命历史博物馆入口处，用于倒计时香港回归的日、时、分、秒。中国问题专家迈克尔·亚胡达在 1996 年指出，此举“旨在公开提醒香港人民，他们即将回归祖国，在中国共产党的领导下。”然而，对北京而言，时间同样紧迫。通过将时钟放置在“这样一个具有象征意义的地方”，中国政府“将香港回归的意义提升到了国家自豪和重大事件的高度”。这口钟不仅是对香港人民的警告，提醒他们殖民统治的时代即将结束，它也“生动地提醒人们，恢复主权和迈向国家统一的新一步，事关重大，新领导人必须妥善处理，并且尽快处理。” 16 正如艺术史学家吴鸿在 1997 年春季所写，这口钟“既是政治宣言，也是北京对香港的威胁姿态”。作为“政治计时器”，这口钟警告香港人民不要以​​民主为借口颠覆中国的共产主义，并“清晰地划分”了香港的“两种身份”——“外国殖民地”或“社会主义祖国不可分割的一部分”——否定了香港拥有第三种自身身份的可能性。 17 +
Although most people in China had not paid much attention to Hong Kong until then, the final countdown to 1997 was observed with great enthusiasm, including with multiepisodic television documentaries on Hong Kong.  +
In Beijing, more than twelve hundred miles away, some one hundred thousand carefully chosen guests watched President Jiang’s handover speech on gigantic television screens in Tiananmen Square.  +
As the Hong Kong Clock counted down to zero, crowds cheered and fireworks exploded over the square, accompanied by patriotic songs and a traditional lion dance.  +
A poster printed for the occasion showed a smiling Deng Xiaoping, architect of the one country, two systems concept, flanked by the Great Wall of China and Tiananmen Square as he hovered approvingly above Hong Kong’s spectacular harbor and skyline.  +
Another poster showed a mainland Chinese mother clasping her small son, who in turn held up the flag of the new Hong Kong SAR.  +
In the background were representatives of China’s various ethnic minority groups, all joining together to welcome Hong Kong and to celebrate its new political status.
尽管此前中国大部分民众对香港关注不多，但1997年香港回归的最后倒计时却引发了极大的热情，电视上播放了多集香港专题纪录片。在远隔一千二百多英里的北京，约十万名精心挑选的嘉宾在天安门广场通过巨型电视屏幕观看了江泽民主席的交接讲话。随着香港时钟倒计时归零，广场上欢呼雀跃，烟花绽放，爱国歌曲和传统的舞狮表演也随之响起。一张为此次活动印制的海报上，面带微笑的邓小平——“一国两制”的缔造者——站在长城和天安门广场的映衬下，俯瞰着香港壮丽的海港和天际线。另一张海报上，一位中国大陆的母亲抱着她的小儿子，小儿子则高举着香港特区的旗帜。背景中，中国各少数民族的代表齐聚一堂，共同欢迎香港的回归，庆祝其新的政治地位。 +



For Hong Kong people, the handover represented a mixture of pride, apprehension, and nostalgia.  +
As the impending transition to Chinese sovereignty approached, many local artists became more concerned with expressing their local identity and their concern with Hong Kong’s uncertain future.  +
One artist, Ho Siu Kee, produced a video performance of a man trying to walk on two balls, suggesting the difficulty of maintaining a balance under the one country, two systems.  +
Another artist, Phoebe Man, produced a satirical mixed-media piece consisting of large Chinese characters repeating the sentence “I am very excited about the ’97 return of Hong Kong.” For many other artists, the handover prompted a sense of nostalgia and retrospection, captured in their depictions of certain historical places or moments.  +
Particularly in the immediate months leading up to the transition, this sense of nostalgia extended beyond the artistic community.  +
In March 1997, the Hong Kong government issued its last set of stamps bearing the portrait of Queen Elizabeth.  +
More than eleven thousand stamp collectors, many of whom had waited overnight, descended on the General Post Office; an elderly collector collapsed and died in the frenzy.  +
During the weekend of March 8–9—the last weekend during which the grounds of Government House, the governor’s official residence, were opened to the public—some one hundred thousand visitors took advantage of this historic occasion.
对香港人而言，回归既代表着自豪，也代表着忧虑，还夹杂着怀旧之情。随着回归中国的日子临近，许多本地艺术家更加关注如何表达他们的本土身份认同，以及他们对香港不确定未来的担忧。艺术家何兆基创作了一段视频表演，视频中一个男人试图在两个球上行走，以此暗示在“一国两制”下维持平衡的难度。另一位艺术家文佩琪创作了一件讽刺性的混合媒介作品，作品由巨大的汉字组成，重复着“我对97年香港回归感到非常兴奋”这句话。对许多其他艺术家而言，回归引发了一种怀旧和回顾之情，这种情感体现在他们对某些历史地点或时刻的描绘中。尤其是在回归前的几个月里，这种怀旧之情甚至蔓延到了艺术界之外。1997年3月，香港政府发行了最后一套印有伊丽莎白女王肖像的邮票。超过一万一千名集邮爱好者涌入邮政总局，其中许多人彻夜等候；一位年长的集邮爱好者在狂热的人群中晕倒身亡。3月8日至9日的周末——总督府（总督官邸）向公众开放的最后一个周末——约有十万名游客前来参观，见证了这一历史性时刻。 +



The different attitudes toward the handover were also manifested in feelings toward emigration, which were shaped by both culture and class.  +
Two years after the handover, sociologist Wong Siu-lun identified four main sets of attitudes toward the reversion to Chinese sovereignty.  +
“Loyalists,” who were born in China and came to Hong Kong later in life and who generally hailed from the lower classes, saw the reversion as good for Hong Kong’s and China’s economies and as a means of reuniting families that had been divided since the 1949 revolution.  +
Born to lower- and working-class families and raised in Hong Kong, “locals” were younger people who had few family ties to China.  +
Politically neutral but attached to the Hong Kong lifestyle of personal freedom and self-expression, they were “firmly attached to Hong Kong” and prepared to “accept the changeover without fanfare.” Mostly from working classes, “waverers,” who wanted to emigrate but were unable to find countries to accept them, preferred British rule to Chinese rule but were waiting to see what would happen.  +
“Cosmopolitans,” usually born in Hong Kong to upper- or middle-class political refugee families that had left China after 1949 and who opposed reunification and preferred British rule, had been planning for 1997 years in advance and already had family ties in the West.18
人们对回归的不同态度也体现在他们对移民的态度上，而这种态度又受到文化和阶级的双重影响。回归两年后，社会学家黄小伦总结出四种主要的回归态度。“保皇派”出生于中国大陆，后移居香港，通常出身于社会底层，他们认为回归有利于香港和中国大陆的经济，也是让自 1949 年革命以来被迫分离的家庭团聚的一种方式。“本地人”出生于香港的底层或工人阶级家庭，在香港长大，他们是与中国大陆联系较少的年轻人。他们政治上保持中立，但认同香港的自由和自我表达的生活方式，他们“牢牢地依恋香港”，并准备“平静地接受回归”。这些人大多来自工人阶级，被称为“摇摆者”，他们想移民却找不到愿意接纳他们的国家，他们更倾向于英国统治而非中国统治，但都在观望事态发展。“世界公民”通常出生于香港，其家庭属于 1949 年后离开中国的中上层政治难民家庭，他们反对统一，更倾向于英国统治，他们早在 1997 年之前就开始筹划，并且在西方已经建立了家族关系 。18 +
In March 1996, many people had seized one last opportunity to secure their post-1997 future by lining up outside the Hong Kong Immigration Department to apply for naturalization as British Dependent Territory Citizens.  +
Although this Dependent Territory citizenship would expire on June 30, 1997, naturalization would qualify them for a British National (Overseas) passport.  +
These passports do not grant their holders the right to live in Britain, but they enable them to travel without visas to many countries.  +
In 1990 more than three million Hong Kong people held such passports.  +
The Hong Kong government had announced in 1993 that no more applications for naturalization would be accepted after March 31, 1996, and although few people initially accepted the government’s offer, by late March so many applicants lined up outside the Immigration Department that the department had to stay open twenty-four hours a day.  +
When the department closed at one minute before midnight on March 31, more than fifty-four thousand people had applied for naturalization.  +
This last day became a public spectacle, especially when a group of rowdy young men had the misfortune of cutting in front of an elderly man who happened to be an expert in martial arts.
1996年3月，许多人抓住最后的机会，在香港入境事务处外排起长队，申请入籍成为英国属地公民，以确保他们在1997年后的未来。尽管这种属地公民身份将于1997年6月30日到期，但入籍后他们可以获得英国国民（海外）护照。这种护照不赋予持有人在英国居住的权利，但允许他们免签前往许多国家。1990年，超过三百万香港人持有此类护照。香港政府于1993年宣布，1996年3月31日之后将不再接受入籍申请。虽然最初接受政府提议的人不多，但到了3月底，申请者蜂拥至入境事务处外，以至于该处不得不24小时开放。3月31日午夜前一分钟，入境事务处关闭时，已有超过五万四千人提交了入籍申请。最后一天变成了一场公开的闹剧，尤其是一群吵闹的年轻人不幸插队到一位恰好是武术专家的老人前面。 +



By early 1997, however, confidence in Hong Kong’s future had increased dramatically.  +
A February survey conducted by the Hong Kong Transition Project at Hong Kong Baptist University found that more than 60 percent of respondents were “optimistic” or “very optimistic” about Hong Kong’s future, compared with only 6 percent who were “pessimistic.” Moreover, more than 60 percent (as opposed to around 40 percent in February 1993) preferred reunification with China rather than remaining a British colony or becoming independent.  +
Satisfaction with the Chinese government had risen to its highest level (38 percent), although this was only slightly greater than half of the approval rating of the Hong Kong government (73 percent).  +
A survey taken in February 1997 by the Ming Pao, a prominent Chinese-language newspaper, showed that the public confidence indicator was as high as it had been before the Tiananmen Square Massacre.  +
Whereas a government survey of November 1994 showed that only 56 percent of the respondents had confidence in Hong Kong’s post-1997 future, a similar survey in April 1997 showed that almost 75 percent of the respondents believed that Hong Kong would remain stable and prosperous after the transition.
然而，到了 1997 年初，人们对香港未来的信心显著提升。香港浸会大学香港转型计划在 2 月份进行的一项调查显示，超过 60%的受访者对香港的未来持“乐观”或“非常乐观”的态度，而持“悲观”态度的仅占 6%。此外，超过 60%的受访者（相比之下，1993 年 2 月这一比例约为 40%）倾向于与中国统一，而不是继续作为英国殖民地或独立。民众对中国政府的满意度也达到了历史最高水平（38%），尽管这一比例仅略高于香港政府支持率（73%）的一半。1997 年 2 月 ，香港著名中文报纸《明报》 进行的一项调查显示，公众信心指数已达到天安门事件发生前的水平。 1994 年 11 月的一项政府调查显示，只有 56% 的受访者对香港 1997 年以后的未来有信心；而 1997 年 4 月的一项类似调查显示，近 75% 的受访者认为香港在过渡后将保持稳定和繁荣。 +



Much of this (albeit guarded) confidence and optimism stemmed from Hong Kong and China’s growing economic interdependence and from China’s economic development, which by the late 1980s had helped make Hong Kong the world’s third-largest financial center (after London and New York).  +
According to government reports, in 1996 every day more than 26,000 cars, 20 trains, 72 airplanes, and 800 ships traveled between Hong Kong and China.  +
Whereas only 362 Chinese oceangoing ships had arrived in Hong Kong in 1979, almost 20,000 such ships arrived in the first half of 1997.  +
Encouraged by the PRC government after the Tiananmen Square Massacre, in the early 1990s Hong Kong manufacturers relocated even more of their production to Guangdong (in 1979 Hong Kong had almost 900,000 manufacturing employees; by 1997 this number had dropped to around 380,000).  +
Large Hong Kong firms invested in mainland real estate and infrastructure, starting in the Pearl River Delta region but soon spreading throughout China.  +
On the eve of the transition, more than 97,000 Hong Kong residents were working in China.
这种（尽管谨慎的）信心和乐观情绪很大程度上源于香港与中国日益增长的经济相互依存以及中国的经济发展。到20世纪80年代末，中国的经济发展已使香港成为继伦敦和纽约之后的世界第三大金融中心。据政府报告显示，1996年，每天有超过26000辆汽车、20列火车、72架飞机和800艘轮船往返于香港和中国之间。 1979年仅有362艘中国远洋船舶抵达香港，而1997年上半年，此类船舶抵达香港的数量接近2万艘。在天安门事件后中国政府的鼓励下，20世纪90年代初，香港制造商将更多生产转移到广东（1979年香港制造业从业人员近90万人；到1997年，这一数字下降到约38万人）。香港大型企业开始投资内地房地产和基础设施，最初集中在珠江三角洲地区，但很快扩展到整个中国。在转型前夕，超过9.7万名香港居民在内地工作。 +



The largest investor in China, Hong Kong now handled half of China’s exports and almost 60 percent of its total foreign investment and provided one-third of its foreign exchange reserves.  +
And whereas in 1986 China was the third-largest investor in Hong Kong (after the United States and Japan), by 1994 it was investing more than twice as much as the United States and Japan combined.  +
More than seventeen hundred Chinese companies were registered in Hong Kong, where Chinese enterprises hired more than fifty thousand people.  +
The increasing commercial importance of China was also reflected in Hong Kong’s shifting physical landscape.  +
In March 1990, the Bank of China moved to its new headquarters, a seventy-story aluminum-and-glass tower in the Central District designed by renowned Chinese American architect I.  +
M.  +
Pei.  +
Not only did the Bank of China building, then the world’s fifth-tallest building, tower over Hong Kong’s main colonial bank, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, but it also cost half as much to build.
香港是中国最大的投资来源地，如今中国一半的出口都来自香港，近60%的外国投资都来自香港，外汇储备的三分之一也来自香港。1986年，中国是香港第三大投资来源地（仅次于美国和日本），而到了1994年，中国在香港的投资额已超过美国和日本总和的两倍。超过1700家中国公司在香港注册，雇佣了超过5万名员工。中国日益增长的商业重要性也体现在香港不断变化的城市面貌上。1990年3月，中国银行迁入位于中环的新总部大楼——一座由著名美籍华裔建筑师贝聿铭设计的70层铝玻璃结构大厦。这座当时的世界第五高楼——中国银行大厦，不仅比香港的主要殖民时期银行——香港上海汇丰银行——高耸入云，而且建造费用仅为后者的一半。 +



Whereas Hong Kong people still harbored reservations about China and its lack of political change, as has so often been the case in modern Chinese history there was nothing like the threat of Japanese nationalism to inspire a sense of Chinese nationalism and patriotism.  +
In the summer of 1996, a Japanese right-wing group placed a lighthouse and a Japanese flag on two of the contested Diaoyutai (Senkaku) Islands.  +
When the local Chinese press declared that the Diaoyutai Islands had fallen, Hong Kong people organized marches and demonstrations and protested outside the Japanese consulate.  +
A group from Hong Kong and Taiwan sent two expeditions to the islands.  +
The first expedition ended tragically on September 26 when its leader, the colorful Hong Kong activist David Chan, drowned while trying to swim ashore, but the second expedition managed to evade a Japanese naval blockade and plant the PRC and Taiwan flags on one of the islands.  +
Whereas some observers saw this “Defend the Diaoyutai” campaign simply as a media attempt to stir up anti-Japanese feelings, others saw it as a way for Hong Kong people to show their Chineseness.
尽管香港民众对中国及其政治变革的停滞仍抱有疑虑，但这在中国近代史上屡见不鲜。然而，没有什么比日本民族主义的威胁更能激发中国民族主义和爱国主义的意识了。1996年夏天，一个日本右翼团体在两座争议岛屿——钓鱼岛（尖阁诸岛）上竖起了一座灯塔并插上了日本国旗。当香港本地媒体宣布钓鱼岛沦陷后，香港民众组织了游行示威，并在日本领事馆外举行抗议活动。香港和台湾的团体派出了两支探险队前往钓鱼岛。第一支探险队于9月26日不幸遇难，其领队、香港著名活动家陈志远在试图游上岸时溺水身亡。但第二支探险队成功突破了日本的海上封锁，并在其中一座岛屿上插上了中华人民共和国和台湾的国旗。一些观察人士认为这场“保卫钓鱼台”运动只是媒体煽动反日情绪的伎俩，而另一些人则认为这是香港人展现中国精神的一种方式。 +



What had not changed significantly was the concern among many parts of the Hong Kong population that the PRC government would try to interfere in Hong Kong affairs after 1997.  +
In January 1997, the Preparatory Committee chose the new provisional legislature, apportioning approximately half the seats to existing Legislative Council members and some of the remaining half to pro-PRC candidates who had lost in the 1995 Legislative Council elections.  +
In the same month, the legal subgroup of the Preparatory Committee proposed to repeal or amend more than 10 percent of Hong Kong’s 240 existing laws.  +
The February 1997 survey conducted by the Hong Kong Transition Project found that many people were still worried about losing their personal freedom after 1997.  +
In April 1997, the legal subgroup of the Preparatory Committee announced two new post-handover HKSAR ordinances, one requiring demonstrations to have police approval, another requiring local groups to obtain permission for associating with foreign organizations.  +
These measures were widely seen as Beijing’s attempts to limit Hong Kong’s freedoms.  +
Only half an hour after the handover, members of the Democratic Party, realizing that they would lose access to the building at midnight, staged a peaceful demonstration and an appeal for democracy at the Legislative Council building that put them in the international media.  +
Party leader Martin Lee delivered his own handover speech, calling for the “freedom we are entitled to under the Joint Declaration” and warning that “if there is no democracy there will be no rule of law; if there is no freedom, human rights will not be respected.”
1997年后，香港民众普遍担忧中国政府会干预香港事务，这种担忧并未发生显著变化。1997年1月，筹备委员会选出了新的临时立法会，将约一半席位分配给了现任立法会议员，其余席位则分配给了在1995年立法会选举中落败的亲中共候选人。同月，筹备委员会的法律小组提议废除或修订香港现行240项法律中的10%以上。香港过渡项目于1997年2月进行的一项调查发现，许多人仍然担心1997年后会失去个人自由。1997年4月，筹备委员会的法律小组宣布了两项新的香港回归后特别行政区条例，一项要求示威游行必须获得警方批准，另一项要求本地团体与外国组织交往必须获得许可。这些措施被广泛视为北京试图限制香港自由的举措。回归仅半小时后，民主党成员意识到午夜后将无法进入立法会大楼，便在立法会大楼前举行和平示威，呼吁民主，此事引起了国际媒体的关注。民主党领袖李柱铭发表了回归演说，呼吁“我们根据《中英联合声明》享有的自由”，并警告说“没有民主就没有法治；没有自由就没有人权”。 +

The handover had an international impact that stretched far beyond Hong Kong.  +
While many Chinese all over the world celebrated, many others, especially those in cities with large Hong Kong Chinese communities, watched in anxiety as the British flag was lowered.  +
Depending on their views toward reunification with the mainland, for people in Taiwan the handover was either a source of inspiration or a chilling warning of what could happen to them next.  +
In East and Southeast Asia, the handover represented the end of colonialism.  +
Even as their own nations’ relations with China improved, many people in these regions saw Hong Kong’s transition to Chinese sovereignty as an ominous sign of China’s expanding power and a potential threat to their own security.  +
Others feared that Chinese rule would make doing business in Hong Kong more difficult by increasing corruption and curtailing political freedoms.  +
The handover was also watched closely by many Japanese, for whom Hong Kong was the most popular tourist destination; they also worried that Hong Kong was to be surrendered to an authoritarian state and were concerned about China’s growing wealth and power in Asia.  +
This explains why on the eve of the handover there were twice as many Japanese journalists as mainland Chinese or British journalists in Hong Kong and why only the local media was larger than the Japanese press corps.
香港回归的国际影响远远超出香港本身。世界各地的许多华人为此欢庆，而另一些人，特别是那些居住在香港华人聚居城市的华人，则忧心忡忡地注视着英国国旗的降下。对于台湾民众而言，回归的意义取决于他们对与大陆统一的看法，有人将其视为鼓舞人心的源泉，也有人将其视为对未来可能遭遇的不寒而栗的警示。在东亚和东南亚，回归标志着殖民主义的终结。即便这些国家与中国的关系有所改善，但这些地区的许多人仍将香港回归中国视为中国势力扩张的不祥之兆，并认为这可能威胁到他们自身的安全。另一些人则担心，中国的统治会加剧腐败、限制政治自由，从而使在香港经商更加困难。许多日本人也密切关注着回归，因为香港是他们最喜爱的旅游目的地；他们也担心香港会落入一个专制国家之手，并对中国在亚洲日益增长的财富和影响力感到担忧。这就解释了为什么在香港回归前夕，在港的日本记者人数是中国大陆或英国记者人数的两倍，以及为什么只有本地媒体的规模大于日本记者团。 +



The handover also had important implications for relations between China and the United States.  +
In 1992 the U.S.  +
Congress enacted the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act, which stipulates that the United States would continue to treat Hong Kong as a separate territory after 1997 as long as the president considers Hong Kong “sufficiently autonomous.” Also known as the McConnell Act after its author, Republican senator Mitch McConnell from Kentucky, the act called for bilateral ties with Hong Kong and for the American secretary of state to make regular reports, which in the early 1990s expressed support for democratic reform and freedom of expression.  +
While Washington frequently reminded Beijing of its promise to uphold the one country, two systems concept after 1997, Beijing just as frequently reminded Washington that Hong Kong’s status was a Chinese matter.
香港回归也对中美关系产生了重要影响。1992年，美国国会通过了《美国-香港政策法案》，该法案规定，只要美国总统认为香港“享有足够的自治权”，美国在1997年后将继续把香港视为一个独立的领土。该法案也因其起草者——来自肯塔基州的共和党参议员米奇·麦康奈尔——而被称为《麦康奈尔法案》。该法案要求与香港建立双边关系，并要求美国国务卿定期提交报告。在20世纪90年代初期，这些报告表达了对香港民主改革和言论自由的支持。尽管华盛顿经常提醒北京，其在1997年后将继续坚持“一国两制”原则，但北京也同样频繁地提醒华盛顿，香港的地位是中国内部事务。 +



Given all the suspicions and mistrust, why did the transfer of sovereignty proceed as smoothly as it did? At the most basic level, Britain was a lame duck and in no position to try to keep Hong Kong, the Chinese government realized that Hong Kong needed to remain prosperous and knew that the handover was being watched all over the world, and the people of Hong Kong could do little to change the course of history.  +
Even as 1997 represented the end of what PRC leaders frequently referred to as China’s “century of humiliation,” it represented a new beginning for the PRC as the nation entered an era of rapid economic development, less social control, and improved relations with the rest of the world.  +
The handover was a chance to prove to the world, especially to Taiwan, that China was sincere about the one country, two systems model.  +
The situation was more complicated, however, and involved changing conditions and attitudes in both China and Hong Kong.
鉴于种种猜忌和不信任，为何主权移交如此顺利？最根本的原因在于，英国当时已是跛脚鸭，无力挽留香港；中国政府意识到香港需要保持繁荣，也明白此次移交受到全世界的关注；香港人民也无力改变历史进程。1997年标志着中华人民共和国领导人常说的“百年屈辱”的结束，同时也标志着中华人民共和国的新起点，国家进入了经济快速发展、社会管控放松、与世界其他地区关系改善的新时代。此次移交是向世界，尤其是向台湾，证明中国对“一国两制”模式诚意的一次机会。然而，实际情况更为复杂，涉及中国大陆和香港两地不断变化的情况和态度。 +



Beijing had adopted a new, more conciliatory policy as the handover approached.  +
Hong Kong people’s confidence in China was so low in late 1995 that Larry Yung, son of Chinese vice president Rong Yiren, warned that attempts by mainland officials to interfere in Hong Kong’s affairs after 1997 could “kill Hong Kong.” Subsequently, the PRC government began to take a more reassuring stance.  +
The vice director of the New China News Agency local branch compared Hong Kong’s economy to a big cake, insisting that Chinese enterprises were in Hong Kong “not to divide the cake” but to make it “bigger and bigger, sweeter and sweeter.” Both Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, and Premier Li Peng, reviled by so many in Hong Kong for his role in the crackdown in Tiananmen Square, declared that the CCP would not send a party secretary to supervise Hong Kong’s chief executive.  +
In April 1996, the PRC government invited Anson Chan, who in November 1993 had become the first ethnic Chinese and first female chief secretary of Hong Kong, to Beijing, where Vice Premier Qian Qichen praised Hong Kong’s civil servants and urged them to stay in Hong Kong after 1997.  +
Nor did Chinese officials criticize the large number of Hong Kong people applying for British Dependent Territory Citizenship who, if accepted for naturalization, would have to swear allegiance to Queen Elizabeth.  +
The Chinese insisted that the elections for Hong Kong’s first chief executive would be open and fair and that the candidate had to be someone acceptable to the people of Hong Kong.
随着香港回归临近，北京采取了更为温和的新政策。1995年底，香港民众对中国的信心跌至谷底，以至于中国国家副主席荣义仁之子容国强警告说，1997年后大陆官员若试图干预香港事务，可能会“扼杀香港”。随后，中国政府开始采取更为安抚人心的姿态。新华社香港分社副社长将香港经济比作一块大蛋糕，强调中国企业在香港“不是为了瓜分蛋糕”，而是为了让它“越做越大，越做越甜”。国港澳事务办公室主任陆平以及因参与天安门事件而备受香港民众诟病的国务院总理李鹏都宣布，中共不会派遣党委书记监督香港特首。 1996年4月，中国政府邀请陈方安生访问北京。陈方安生于1993年11月成为香港首位华裔、首位女性政务司司长。国务院副总理钱其琛在北京会见了陈方安生，赞扬了香港公务员，并敦促他们在1997年后继续留在香港。中国官员也没有批评大量香港人申请英国属地公民身份，这些人如果入籍成功，就必须宣誓效忠英国女王伊丽莎白二世。中国政府坚持认为，香港首任行政长官的选举将公开、公平，候选人必须是香港市民能够接受的人选。 +



In what Alvin So calls an “antagonistic alliance,” Beijing, the new HKSAR government, and the Democratic Party reached a “democratic compromise” just before July 1, even as they continued to disagree on ideological and policy issues.19 This understanding was based on an agreement to include all the major parties in the post-1997 elections and on a consensus on the need for continued economic prosperity and political stability.  +
On the eve of the 1997 transition, the three biggest political parties in Hong Kong were the Democratic Party, the Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong, and the Liberal Party.  +
Headed by Martin Lee, the Democratic Party was prodemocratic and anti-Communist but not opposed to reunification with China (its early slogan was “democratic reunification”).  +
Its leaders were mostly middle-class professionals critical of the crackdown in Tiananmen Square, but the party also enjoyed strong support from lower classes because of its welfare policies.  +
Led by Tsang Yok Sing, principal of a pro-Chinese patriotic school, the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong had strong connections to working-class unions.  +
Despite their different political attitudes toward China, the Democratic Party and the Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong were for the most part in agreement regarding policies toward education, housing, health care, education, labor, and welfare.  +
The Liberal Party consisted mainly of businesspeople and professionals.  +
Whereas it had maintained a good relationship with Patten even while maintaining its commitment to reunification with China, it shifted its allegiance toward Beijing as 1997 approached.
在苏伟伦所称的“对抗联盟”中，北京、新成立的香港特区政府和民主党在 7 月 1 日之前达成了一项“民主妥协”，尽管他们在意识形态和政策问题上仍然存在分歧。 19 这一谅解基于一项协议，即所有主要政党都应参与 1997 年后的选举，以及对持续经济繁荣和政治稳定的必要性达成共识。在 1997 年过渡期前夕，香港三大政党分别是民主党、民建联和自由党。民主党由李柱铭领导，主张民主和反共，但并不反对与中国统一（其早期口号是“民主统一”）。该党领导人大多是中产阶级专业人士，他们对天安门事件的镇压持批评态度，但由于其福利政策，该党也享有下层阶级的强大支持。在亲中爱国学校校长曾耀声的领导下，亲北京的香港民主复兴联与工人阶级工会关系密切。尽管民主党和香港民主复兴联对中国的政治态度不同，但在教育、住房、医疗、劳工和福利等政策方面，两党立场基本一致。自由党主要由商界人士和专业人士组成。尽管自由党在坚持统一的同时，也与彭定康保持着良好的关系，但随着 1997 年的临近，其立场逐渐转向北京。 +



1997 IN WORLD HISTORY  1997年世界历史
Several features made Hong Kong’s transition to Chinese rule in 1997 so distinctive in world history.  +
Not only was it the last significant British colony to decolonize, it was also the most economically successful of British colonies.  +
As Goodstadt writes, Hong Kong’s “record of sustained and self-generated growth seemed to redeem the reputation of both colonialism and capitalism.  +
The last remnant of the British Empire in Asia had made itself the equal of First World cities against considerable political and economic odds.”20 The transition was prearranged in a way that distinguished it, for example, from the independence of India in 1947 or the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.  +
Nor would the handover lead to independence, as it did in most other European colonies in the decades after World War II.  +
Indeed, to some observers Hong Kong was not being decolonized; rather, it was being recolonized, with the metropole simply shifting from London to Beijing.  +
The most pressing question for the majority of the people in Hong Kong, however, was not how this transition figured in world history but instead whether Hong Kong would indeed be able to keep its distinctive way of life after 1997 under the one country, two systems model.
1997 年香港回归中国，其诸多特点使其在世界历史上独树一帜。它不仅是最后一个实现非殖民化的英国殖民地，也是英国殖民地中经济最成功的。正如古德斯塔特所写，香港“持续的、自主增长的记录似乎洗刷了殖民主义和资本主义的恶名。作为英国在亚洲的最后残余，香港克服了巨大的政治和经济劣势，跻身世界一流城市之列。” 20 此次回归是事先安排好的，这与 1947 年印度的独立或 1989 年柏林墙的倒塌截然不同。香港的回归也不会像二战后几十年里大多数其他欧洲殖民地那样，最终走向独立。事实上，在一些观察家看来，香港并非非殖民化，而是重新殖民化，其中心只是从伦敦转移到了北京。然而，对香港的大多数民众来说，最紧迫的问题不是这一转变在世界历史上的意义，而是香港在 1997 年后能否在一国两制模式下保持其独特的生活方式。 +
