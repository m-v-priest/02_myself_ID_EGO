On January 25, 1841, a British naval party landed and raised the British flag on the northern shore of Hong Kong, a small island located in the Pearl River Delta in southern China. The next day, the commander of the British expeditionary force took formal possession of the island in the name of the British Crown. Except for three and a half years during World War II when Hong Kong was part of the short-lived Japanese Empire, the British occupation would last until midnight on July 1, 1997, whereupon Hong Kong became a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China. As newspapers throughout China proudly declared, Hong Kong was “home at last.” +
1841年1月25日，一支英国海军舰队登陆香港，并在香港北岸升起了英国国旗。香港位于中国南部珠江三角洲，是一座小岛。次日，英国远征军指挥官以英国王室的名义正式占领了香港。除二战期间香港曾短暂沦为日本帝国的三年半时间外，英国对香港的占领一直持续到1997年7月1日午夜，香港正式成为中华人民共和国的特别行政区。正如中国各地报纸所自豪地宣称的那样，香港“终于回家了”。

Technically speaking, the name “Hong Kong” (which means “Fragrant Harbor” in Chinese) refers to Hong Kong Island, ceded by the Qing dynasty to Great Britain “in perpetuity” in 1842 under the Treaty of Nanking. Located about 80 miles southeast of the city of Canton (known today as Guangzhou), this tiny island is only 11 miles from east to west and 2 to 5 miles from north to south. The name “Hong Kong,” however, is generally used to cover a larger area with three main parts: Hong Kong Island; Kowloon Peninsula, consisting of 8 square miles and ceded to Britain in 1860 under the Convention of Peking; and the New Territories, an area of 365 square miles leased to Britain for ninety-nine years in 1898 that includes approximately 230 outlying islands. Although Hong Kong has no natural resources to speak of, its harbor, deep and sheltered by steep granite hills, is one of the best in the world. With a population of around seven million and very little good land for building, Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated places on earth. Hot and humid for much of the year, it is hardly surprising that some early British colonists wondered why their government ever took Hong Kong Island in the first place. +
严格来说，“香港”（中文意为“香港”）指的是香港岛，清朝于1842年根据《南京条约》将香港岛“永久”割让给英国。这座小岛位于广州（今广州市）东南约80英里处，东西长仅11英里，南北宽2至5英里。然而，“香港”一词通常指代更大的区域，该区域主要由三部分组成：香港岛；九龙半岛，面积8平方英里，于1860年根据《北京条约》割让给英国；以及新界，面积365平方英里，于1898年租借给英国99年，其中包括约230个离岛。尽管香港本身并无丰富的自然资源，但其海港深邃，四周环绕着陡峭的花岗岩山丘，是世界上最好的海港之一。香港人口约七百万，而适宜建造房屋的土地却寥寥无几，是世界上人口密度最高的地区之一。香港一年中大部分时间气候炎热潮湿，难怪一些早期的英国殖民者会质疑英国政府当初为何要占领香港岛。

Over time, Hong Kong would become a booming port and thriving metropolis. Until recently, however, historians paid little attention to Hong Kong. Scholars of British colonialism concentrated mainly on Africa and India, while a handful of locally based British historians focused primarily on Hong Kong’s colonial administration—especially the roles played by various British governors and civil servants—practically overlooking the Chinese who comprised around 98 percent of the colony’s population. And until the years leading up to the transfer to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, mainland Chinese historians all but ignored Hong Kong. Only one university in China had a research institute dedicated to studying Hong Kong. Even for the few scholars on the mainland who studied Hong Kong, the colony had little intrinsic importance beyond its significance as the fruit of British imperialism and colonialism and as a base for the Western imperialists’ invasion of China in the 1800s. +
随着时间的推移，香港发展成为一个繁荣的港口和繁华的大都市。然而，直到最近，历史学家对香港的关注仍然寥寥无几。研究英国殖民主义的学者主要集中于非洲和印度，而少数在香港的英国历史学家则主要关注香港的殖民统治——尤其是历任英国总督和公务员所扮演的角色——几乎完全忽略了占香港人口约98%的华人。在1997年香港回归中国之前的几年里，中国大陆的历史学家也几乎完全忽视了香港。当时，中国只有一所大学设有专门研究香港的研究所。即使对于少数研究香港的大陆学者而言，除了作为英国帝国主义和殖民主义的产物, 以及19世纪西方帝国主义入侵中国的基地之外，香港本身并没有太多内在价值。

In the past twenty years, scholars —mostly based in Hong Kong— have reconstructed a much more complex and nuanced 微妙的；有细微差别的 history that considers (v.)（尤指为作出决定而）仔细考虑，细想 *both* Hong Kong’s colonial 殖民的 features *and* the _contributions_ of local Chinese `后定说明` _to_ its historical development. +
Why have historians outside of Hong Kong `谓` taken so long *to take Hong Kong seriously* 認真考慮；鄭重對待? The answer says #*less*# 与其说……不如说 about Hong Kong than #*about*# the way historians approach (v.)着手处理；对待 their subjects. +
In the United States, `主` the call (n.)要求；请求；呼吁 for a China-centered history of China `谓` has led to a tendency 趋势；倾向 to downplay (v.)贬低；低估；对……轻描淡写 the international aspects 方面 of China’s history. +
In China, `主` one reason for this neglect 忽视；忽略 `系` is the bias 偏见；偏心 against *acknowledging (v.)承认；认可 foreign influences*, except for negative ones 除了负面影响之外. +
Another reason is the shame of colonization 殖民统治；殖民化 and Hong Kong’s commercial success 商业成功: like Taiwan, capitalist 资本主义的 Hong Kong until recently *served as* an embarrassing 令人尴尬的；使人难堪的 counterpoint 对比；对照物；对立面 to Communist 共产主义的 China. The traditional Chinese disdain (v.)鄙视；蔑视 for emigrants 移民；侨民, who were often seen as *either* criminals  罪犯 *or* unfilial 不孝的 scoundrels 恶棍；无赖；流氓 for *leaving the motherland* and *abandoning 抛弃；遗弃 their families*, is another reason. +
Finally, people in northern China, where political power has traditionally been centered (集中；居中) 在传统上政治权力集中的地方, have often *looked down on* 轻视；看不起 southern China and its inhabitants 居民；住户。 +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.The traditional Chinese disdain (v.)鄙视；蔑视 for emigrants +
disdain :
[ VN] to think that sb/sth is not good enough to deserve your respect 鄙视；蔑视；鄙弃 +
-> dis-, 不，非，使相反。-dain, 同-dign, 尊贵，词源同dignity, decent.即使不尊贵，蔑视。 +

.who were often seen as *either* criminals  *or* unfilial 不孝的 scoundrels +
filial:
(a.) [ usually before noun] ( formal ) connected with the way children behave towards their parents 子女（对父母）的 +
-> 来自拉丁语filius, 儿子，filia, 女儿，##来自拉丁词根fe, 吮吸，喂奶，##词源同fetal, fecund. +

.The answer says *less* about Hong Kong *than* about the way historians approach (v.) their subjects. +
less than​ 是一个常见的比较结构，用来强调“与其说……不如说……”或“……少，……多”。 +
#*Less about A than about B：意思是“关于A的内容少，关于B的内容多”。*# +
翻译过来就是：“#*与其说是关于A，不如说是关于B*#”。 +
直译：这个答案"关于香港的内容"，比"关于历史学家研究方式的内容"要少。 +
意译：这个答案, 与其说是关于香港的，不如说是关于历史学家如何研究他们的课题的。 +

例：

- He is *less* a teacher​ *than* a friend.
（与其说他是老师，不如说他是朋友。）
- It was *less* a meeting​ *than* a party.
（与其说那是个会议，不如说那是个派对。）

In the past twenty years, scholars—mostly based in Hong Kong—have reconstructed a much more complex and nuanced history that considers both Hong Kong’s colonial features and the contributions of local Chinese to its historical development. Why have historians outside of Hong Kong taken so long to take Hong Kong seriously? "The answer says less about Hong Kong than about the way historians approach their subjects. "In the United States, the call for a China-centered history of China has led to a tendency to downplay the international aspects of China’s history. In China, one reason for this neglect is the bias against acknowledging foreign influences, except for negative ones. Another reason is the shame of colonization and Hong Kong’s commercial success: like Taiwan, capitalist Hong Kong until recently served as an embarrassing counterpoint to Communist China. The traditional Chinese disdain for emigrants, who were often seen as either criminals or unfilial scoundrels for leaving the motherland and abandoning their families, is another reason. Finally, people in northern China, where political power has traditionally been centered, have often looked down on southern China and its inhabitants. +
过去二十年间，学者们——其中大部分身处香港——重构了一部更为复杂细致的历史，既考察了香港的殖民特征，也关注了本土华人对其历史发展的贡献。为何香港以外的历史学家迟迟未能认真对待香港？答案与其说是香港本身的问题，不如说是历史学家研究课题的方式的问题。在美国，"以中国为中心的中国史研究方法"导致了一种倾向，即淡化中国历史的国际层面。在中国，造成这种忽视的原因之一是人们倾向于不承认外国影响，除非是负面影响。另一个原因是殖民历史的耻辱感以及香港的商业成功：与台湾一样，资本主义的香港直到最近都被视为共产主义中国的尴尬对立面。此外，中国人传统上对移民的蔑视——他们往往被视为罪犯或不孝之徒，因为他们背井离乡，抛弃了家人——也是造成这种现象的原因之一。最后，政治权力历来集中在中国北方的人们，常常瞧不起中国南方及其居民。

Compared to cities such as Beijing, China’s capital, Hong Kong may seem politically peripheral (a.)边缘的；次要的；外围的. +

[.my1]

====
.peripheral +
(n.) the outer edge of a particular area 边缘；周围；外围 +
(n.) the less important part of sth, for example of a particular activity or of a social or political group次要部分；次要活动；边缘 +

-> peri-,在周围，-pher,带来，词源同 bring,pheromone.引申词义外围，边缘。 +
##前缀peri表“周围，环绕”，可以用同前缀单词 period（周期）助记，“周期”就是环绕一圈的时间嘛；##词根 pher，体会它的发音和词根 fer 相同，它们是一个词根，表“拿、带”。所以整个单词的字面意思是“传到周围”。可以和 circumference 类比串记。

[ + adv./prep.] to become unsteady and fall down; to make sth do this（使）失去平衡而坠落，倒塌，倒下 +
[ VN] to make sb lose their position of power or authority 打倒；推翻；颠覆 +

-> 来自 top,顶端，头部，-le,表反复。特殊用法或比喻用法，引申词义从顶部摔下，倒塌等。

.Wu Ting-fang
伍廷芳 （ 1842 年 7 月 30 日－1922 年 6 月 23 日）是一位中国外交家、律师、政治家和作家，在中华民国初期, 曾担任外交部长, 和短暂的代理总理 。他也被称为伍才或伍阿才.

Compared to cities such as Shanghai, the bustling metropolis once considered the “Paris of the Orient,” Hong Kong may seem commercially peripheral. +
Hong Kong was arguably the most important place in China for more than 150 years, however, precisely because it was not politically part of China. +
Sun Yat-sen, the man who led the revolution that toppled the last Chinese dynasty in 1911, was educated in colonial Hong Kong. +
The father of modern Chinese law, Wu Tingfang, was raised and educated in Hong Kong, where he was better known as Ng Choy. +
From its early colonial days, Hong Kong served as a haven for Chinese refugees: during the Taiping Rebellion (1851–1864), after the republican revolution of 1911 and throughout the turbulent 1920s, after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, and after the Communist revolution of 1949. +
与中国首都北京等城市相比，香港在政治上似乎处于边缘地位。与曾被誉为“东方巴黎”的繁华大都市上海相比，香港在商业上似乎也处于边缘地位。然而，香港在长达150多年的时间里，恰恰因为其政治地位并非中国的一部分，而成为中国最重要的地区之一。领导辛亥革命推翻1911年中国最后一个王朝的孙中山先生，正是在殖民地时期的香港接受教育。中国现代法学之父吴廷瑈也在香港长大并接受教育，当时他更为人熟知的名字是吴财。从早期的殖民时期起，香港就一直是中国难民的避难所：在太平天国运动（1851-1864 年）期间，在 1911 年的共和革命之后和整个动荡的 20 世纪 20 年代，在 1937 年的中日战争爆发之后，以及在 1949 年的共产党革命之后。 +

▶ gemini: +
Kerosene（煤油） 是一种透明、略带淡黄色的液体燃料，它是从石油中提炼出来的“中间分子”。 +
如果你把石油想象成一棵大树，汽油就像是顶端轻盈的小树枝，柴油是接近底部的粗壮树根，而煤油则是中间那段树干。

它们最本质的区别在于分子的重量（碳链长度）和挥发性。我们可以用**“火焰的性格”**来比喻：

[.my3]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a,1a,1a"]
|===
|特性|汽油 (Gasoline)|煤油 (Kerosene)|柴油 (Diesel)

|性格比喻|急性子：见火就着，极其活跃|稳重派：燃烧平稳，不易爆炸|慢性子：性格沉稳，力气巨大
|挥发性|极高（哪怕在低温下也容易变气体）|中等（挥发较慢，相对安全）|低（很难自然挥发）
|主要用途|家用轿车、割草机|航空燃料（喷气飞机）、取暖|卡车、轮船、重型机械
|点火方式|火花塞点火（一碰就燃）|雾化喷射燃烧|压燃（靠高压挤压产生的热量）
|===

在原油精炼的过程中，它们是按沸点被“分家”的： +
原油加热 → 汽油（最先气化飘走） → 煤油（中间层） → 柴油（较重的一层） → 沥青（剩下的渣子）

- 汽油就像“酒精”： *你还没靠近，就能闻到浓浓的味道。##它非常敏感，哪怕一个小火花，它就会瞬间“嘭”地炸开。##所以它适合需要快速反应、轻便灵活的小汽车。*

- 煤油就像“蜡烛”： 你把火柴靠近液态蜡，它不会立刻爆燃，但如果你给它一根灯芯（或者把它喷成雾状），它就能提供非常持久、稳定的火焰。这就是为什么飞机发动机（喷气发动机）偏爱煤油，因为它在高空低温下依然性能稳定，且不像汽油那样容易在高压下提前“乱炸”。 +
**现在煤油最主要的舞台, 不是在厨房的灯笼里，而是在万米高空。**现代喷气式飞机使用的 Jet A-1 燃料，本质上就是经过高度提纯的煤油。因为**它在极低温度下（高空 -40°C 甚至更低）不容易结冰，**且能量密度高，能支撑飞机长途飞行。

- 柴油就像“粗木头”： 你很难用火柴直接点燃一根粗木头。但一旦你用巨大的压力把它“压”到极热，它释放出的能量比细枝末节大得多。所以重型卡车和坦克这种“干重活”的家伙都选柴油。

Until recent decades, about 90 percent of all Chinese emigrants went through Hong Kong. +
From the 1960s until the 1980s, Hong Kong exported goods throughout the world. +
More recently, it has attained worldwide acclaim for its innovative cinema. +
To people in China, Hong Kong is even more significant for its imports. +
The Chinese who returned to China from North America or Southeast Asia almost always came through Hong Kong. +
Money from overseas Chinese was remitted through Hong Kong. +
After the Communist revolution of 1949, capitalist Hong Kong played an important and ironic role in building China’s Socialist economy: as a window to the outside world, as a center for remittances from overseas Chinese that provided valuable foreign exchange, and as a base for importing goods that China could not produce. +
Hong Kong was of particular use to the Chinese during the Korean War, as scarce goods such as gas, kerosene, and penicillin were smuggled in during the American and United Nations embargoes. +
Hong Kong investors were also partly responsible for China’s dramatic economic transformation that began in the late 1970s and continues to this day. +
自丝绸之路和蒙古帝国以来，香港一直是连接中国与世界其他地区最重要的纽带。直到近几十年，约90%的中国移民都经由香港。从20世纪60年代到80年代，香港向世界各地出口商品。近年来，香港凭借其创新电影享誉全球。对中国民众而言，香港的进口意义更为重大。从北美或东南亚返回中国的华人几乎都经由香港。海外华人的汇款也通过香港汇回国内。1949年共产党革命后，资本主义的香港在建设中国社会主义经济的过程中扮演了重要而又讽刺的角色：它既是通往外部世界的窗口，又是海外华人汇款的中心，提供了宝贵的外汇，同时也是进口中国无法生产的商品的基地。在朝鲜战争期间，香港对中国来说尤为重要，因为在美方和联合国实施禁运期间，汽油、煤油和青霉素等稀缺物资都是通过香港走私进入中国的。香港投资者也对始于20世纪70年代末并延续至今的中国经济转型做出了部分贡献。 +

Especially because Hong Kong has reverted recently to Chinese sovereignty, scholars today usually emphasize the Chineseness of Hong Kong. +
To be sure, Hong Kong’s geographical location meant that its history was affected primarily by events in China, especially in Guangdong province just across the border. +
Hong Kong’s population was always overwhelmingly Chinese, while the proximity to China meant that Chinese affairs mattered more than British affairs to most residents. +
But Hong Kong had a particularly complex relationship with mainland China. +
As a popular Chinese saying went, “when there’s trouble in Hong Kong, go to China; when there’s trouble in China, go back to Hong Kong.” For most of Hong Kong’s colonial history, however, the trouble was almost always in China, which meant that Hong Kong was often at the receiving end of a massive wave of immigrants from China. +
Hong Kong depended on these immigrants for their labor and capital, yet colonial Hong Kong contributed so much to China’s nation-building that many observers in the early 1990s predicted that Hong Kong would continue to change China after the handover in 1997, rather than vice versa. +
尤其因为香港近期回归中国，学者们如今通常强调香港的“中国性”。诚然，香港的地理位置决定了其历史主要受中国大陆，特别是毗邻的广东省的事件影响。香港人口始终以华人为主，而与中国大陆的地理位置也意味着，对大多数居民而言，中国事务比英国事务更为重要。但香港与中国大陆的关系却异常复杂。正如一句中国谚语所说：“港内有事，回中；中内有事，回港。”然而，在香港的大部分殖民历史时期，麻烦几乎总是发生在中国大陆，这意味着香港经常成为来自中国大陆的大规模移民潮的接收地。香港依靠这些移民的劳动力和资本，但殖民时期的香港对中国的建国做出了巨大贡献，以至于 20 世纪 90 年代初许多观察家预测，香港在 1997 年回归后将继续改变中国，而不是反过来。 +

Not only is Hong Kong an important part of modern Chinese history, it is also part of British colonial history. +
Despite Hong Kong’s Chinese influences, we should not underestimate the effect of British colonial rule. +
Colonialism transformed Hong Kong’s historical development, shaped the form of the encounters between the Chinese and British, and determined power relations between them. +
Simply put, Hong Kong would not have become the place it did had it not been a British colony for over 150 years. +
Chinese criminals were often transported to other British colonies, such as the Straits Settlements in Malaya and the island of Labuan off the coast of Borneo. +
British colonists always kept abreast of affairs in other colonies, particularly in India where many had family ties or business relations. +
Especially in the mid-1800s, Hong Kong was tightly connected to India—through trade, primarily cotton and opium, and by a regular passenger ship service between the two colonies. +
In the early days, troops in the British garrison were paid in rupees, which were widely used in the colony until the 1860s. +
Until the establishment of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank in 1864, most of the Western banks in Hong Kong and China were branch offices of Anglo-Indian banks. +
Indigenous Chinese architecture was the norm in rural areas of the region until the twentieth century, but the ubiquitous “Chinese” architectural style that characterized early urban Hong Kong—the shop with living quarters upstairs and a verandah—was imported to Hong Kong from another British colony, Singapore, which in turn was affected by older colonial cities in India, such as Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras. +
香港不仅是中国近代史的重要组成部分，也是英国殖民史的一部分。尽管香港深受中国文化影响，但我们不应低估英国殖民统治的影响。殖民主义改变了香港的历史发展，塑造了中英关系的模式，并决定了双方的权力关系。简而言之，如果没有长达150多年的英国殖民统治，香港就不会成为今天的样子。中国罪犯经常被流放到其他英国殖民地，例如马来亚的海峡殖民地和婆罗洲沿岸的纳闽岛。英国殖民者始终密切关注其他殖民地的动态，尤其是在印度，因为许多人与印度有着家族或商业联系。尤其是在19世纪中期，香港与印度的联系非常紧密——主要通过棉花和鸦片等贸易，以及往返于两地之间的定期客运服务。早期，驻港英军的薪饷以卢比支付，卢比在殖民地广泛流通至19世纪60年代。1864年香港上海汇丰银行成立之前，香港和中国的大多数西方银行都是英印银行的分支机构。20世纪之前，中国本土建筑风格在香港农村地区盛行，但早期香港城市普遍存在的“中国式”建筑风格——楼上是店铺，楼下是起居室，楼上是走廊——是从另一个英国殖民地新加坡传入香港的，而新加坡的建筑风格又受到印度一些更古老的殖民城市（如孟买、加尔各答和马德拉斯）的影响。 +

Hong Kong’s history was also greatly influenced by its colonial 殖民的 administrators 管理者；行政官员. +
Until the early 1970s, governors 主管，机构负责人;总督；州长 were selected from the British colonial service 殖民机构 and had served 任职；服务 in other colonies 殖民地 before coming to Hong Kong. +
Alexander Grantham, governor from 1947 to 1957, had worked for the Hong Kong government in the 1920s and 1930s and had served in Bermuda 百慕大群岛, Jamaica, Nigeria, Fiji, and the South Pacific before returning to Hong Kong. +
These governors’ experiences in other colonies often shaped 塑造；影响 their attitudes  toward Hong Kong. +
In the 1950s and 1960s, Hong Kong received a group of _colonial “retreads,”_ ( 翻新轮胎, (非正式)培训后再就业者，重服兵役者) 经改编后再用的人；调任的资深官员 second-generation 第二代的 colonial servants （公司或机构的）雇员，职员 transferred 调任；转移 from the recently _independent British colonies and dependencies_ 附属地；属地 in Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East. +
From top to bottom 从上到下；彻头彻尾, Hong Kong’s government was a colonial one. +
For example, as late as 直到；晚至 the 1960s, the Hong Kong police force 警察部队；警方 was organized along _traditional colonial lines_ (（行进的）方向，路线;方法；方式) 按照传统殖民模式. +

For example, as late as the 1960s, the Hong Kong police force was organized along traditional colonial lines. +
Most of its senior officers were expatriate veterans from Africa, Malaya, and Palestine, while junior officers were generally Chinese. +
香港的历史也深受其殖民地官员的影响。直到20世纪70年代初，香港总督均从英国殖民地官员中选拔，他们此前曾在其他殖民地任职。1947年至1957年担任香港总督的亚历山大·格兰瑟姆，曾在20世纪20年代和30年代为香港政府效力，并在返回香港之前先后在百慕大、牙买加、尼日利亚、斐济和南太平洋地区任职。这些总督在其他殖民地的经历往往影响了他们对香港的态度。20世纪50年代和60年代，香港迎来了一批“殖民地老手”，他们是第二代殖民地官员，从非洲、南亚和中东等新近独立的英国殖民地和属地调任而来。从上到下，香港政府都带有浓厚的殖民地色彩。例如，直到20世纪60年代，香港警队的组织架构仍然沿袭着传统的殖民地模式。该部队的大多数高级军官是来自非洲、马来亚和巴勒斯坦的退伍老兵，而初级军官则多为中国人。 +

Hong Kong is also important for understanding comparative colonial history. +
Many scholars argue that much of the world is still colonial, or neo-colonial, in that the Euro-American nations have historically derived much of their wealth and power at the expense of the less fortunate African, Asian, and Latin American nations. +
Much of Africa, carved up by the European powers in the late 1800s, remains impoverished and torn by ethnic violence. +
India, once Britain’s “Jewel in the Crown” and now second in population only to China, is also plagued by poverty and by religious and ethnic violence. +
But any generalizations about colonialism must consider how Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States—all formerly British settler colonies—enjoy a higher standard of living than Britain (although living standards for much of these nations’ indigenous populations remain very low). +
Living standards in Hong Kong and Singapore, also once a British colony, are also generally higher than in Britain, just as living conditions in Taiwan and South Korea, both formerly Japanese colonies, are also very high. +
Indian, Pakistani, and West Indian teams frequently beat the British at cricket, a sport bequeathed to them by the British, while Australians, New Zealanders, and South Africans often defeat them in rugby, another British legacy. +
香港对于理解比较殖民史也至关重要。许多学者认为，世界大部分地区至今仍处于殖民或新殖民状态，因为欧美国家历史上大多以牺牲非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲等弱势国家的利益为代价，攫取了其财富和权力。19世纪末被欧洲列强瓜分的非洲大部分地区至今仍贫困不堪，饱受种族冲突的蹂躏。印度曾是英国的“皇冠上的明珠”，如今人口仅次于中国，同样饱受贫困以及宗教和种族暴力的困扰。然而，任何关于殖民主义的概括都必须考虑到，澳大利亚、加拿大、新西兰和美国——这些曾经的英国殖民地——的生活水平普遍高于英国（尽管这些国家的大部分原住民的生活水平仍然很低）。香港和新加坡——同样曾是英国殖民地——的生活水平也普遍高于英国，正如台湾和韩国——这两个曾经的日本殖民地——的生活水平也很高一样。印度、巴基斯坦和西印度群岛的球队经常在板球比赛中击败英国队，板球是英国人留给他们的运动；而澳大利亚人、新西兰人和南非人经常在橄榄球比赛中击败他们，橄榄球也是英国人留下的另一项遗产。 +

Repressive and racist as it was, colonialism in Hong Kong was not always confusing or disruptive for the local Chinese population. +
Mutual fear of the chaos that engulfed China for much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as well as shared commitment to economic freedom and political stability often provided an idiom that both the British colonialists and their Chinese subjects could understand. +
Colonialism in Hong Kong was thus based as much on similarities and affinities as on otherness and difference. +
历史学家过去主要关注殖民主义的利弊，而如今他们则提出了更为细致入微的观点。例如，我们意识到，前殖民时期的社会并非总是像反殖民民族主义者经常描绘的那样和平和谐。我们理解，殖民主义的实现离不开当地人民的合作，香港的殖民历史便是如此。殖民主义曾被视为原住民的创伤性经历，而如今人们更多地将其理解为一系列相互接触的过程，其中一些基于困惑，另一些则基于相互理解。尽管香港的殖民主义充满压迫和种族歧视，但它并非总是令当地华人感到困惑或动荡。对十九世纪和二十世纪席卷中国的动荡局势的共同恐惧，以及对经济自由和政治稳定的共同追求，常常构成了一种英国殖民者和其中国臣民都能理解的语言。因此，香港的殖民主义既建立在相似性和亲缘性之上，也建立在差异性和不一致性之上。 +

Chamber of Commerce in 1969 demonstrated America’s increasing involvement in Hong Kong’s economy, and by the late 1970s the number of Americans in Hong Kong had begun to surpass the number of British expatriates. +
Even though the economic reforms in mainland China have enabled American firms to expand their operations there, many of these firms still have a large presence in Hong Kong, while the American government is determined to ensure that the Chinese government keeps its promise to abide by the one country, two systems model that has governed Hong Kong since its reversion to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. +
Hong Kong’s reputation as a free port with low taxes and minimal government intervention in its economy has also drawn the praise of free-market economists and conservatives such as noted economist Milton Friedman. +
历史学家很少关注香港史或美国史的这一方面，但自19世纪初以来，美国就对香港抱有特殊的兴趣。早期殖民地时期，美国鸦片商人在香港拥有举足轻重的地位，而香港在19世纪和20世纪是美国跨太平洋贸易的重要枢纽，进口人参、面粉、木材和煤油等商品，出口丝绸、茶叶、藤条和劳动力等。尽管许多美国人，尤其是在二战期间及战后，对帝国主义持反感态度，但在冷战时期，随着殖民主义似乎比共产主义的扩张更具吸引力，他们对帝国主义的批判态度有所减弱。因此，香港对美国而言变得至关重要，它既是美国监听中国动向的据点，也是反共宣传的基地，更是朝鲜战争和越南战争期间美国军人休养的热门目的地。朝鲜战争后，香港向美国消费市场供应服装、塑料花、假发等制成品，其中许多产自美国资本投资的工厂。1969年美国商会的成立标志着美国对香港经济的参与度日益提高，到20世纪70年代末，在港美国人的数量已开始超过英国侨民的数量。 尽管中国大陆的经济改革使美国公司得以扩大在中国大陆的业务，但其中许多公司仍然在香港拥有大量业务，而美国政府决心确保中国政府信守承诺，遵守自1997年香港回归中国以来一直沿用的“一国两制”模式。香港作为自由港，税收低廉，政府对经济干预极少，其声誉也赢得了自由市场经济学家和保守派人士（如著名经济学家米尔顿·弗里德曼）的赞誉。 +

Lying at the strategic intersection of Chinese and British imperial history, Hong Kong also has its own history and identity, replete with contradictions, problems, and idiosyncrasies that have shaped its present. +
Some of the contradictions and problems are endemic to any capitalist society. +
For example, although Hong Kong has some extraordinarily rich people, they make up a tiny percentage of the population. +
Other contradictions are legacies of colonialism. +
Despite a relatively high degree of personal freedom, for example, until the late 1980s and early 1990s Hong Kong had no political representation or political parties. +
Some of the idiosyncrasies result from Hong Kong as an encounter between China and Britain, creating what is arguably the most cosmopolitan city in Asia. +
(Some would say that the honor goes to Shanghai, as it would have in the 1920s and 1930s.) Small Chinese shops sit comfortably on streets named after British royalty and colonial administrators, while British law, Christianity, and modern Western medicine coexist happily with traditional Chinese medicine, several hundred Chinese temples, a plethora of religious festivals and ceremonies, and a fervent belief in feng shui (geomancy, or the balance between humans and nature) applied in even the most modern Western-style buildings and in the new Disneyland that opened in 2005. +
Especially noticeable in a region with so little open space is another British legacy and Hong Kong’s most popular pastime: horse racing in Happy Valley on Hong Kong Island and Sha Tin in the New Territories, eagerly embraced by the local population and protected under the one country, two systems model. +
香港地处中英帝国历史的战略交汇点，拥有其独特的历史和身份认同，其中充满了矛盾、问题和特质，塑造了其今日的面貌。有些矛盾和问题是任何资本主义社会都固有的。例如，尽管香港有一些极其富有的人，但他们只占总人口的一小部分。另一些矛盾则是殖民主义的遗留产物。例如，尽管香港享有相对较高的个人自由，但在20世纪80年代末90年代初之前，香港一直没有政治代表或政党。香港的一些特质源于其作为中英两国交汇点的历史，造就了这座堪称亚洲最具国际化都市的城市。 （有人会说，这份殊荣应该属于上海，就像它在20世纪二三十年代那样。）小小的中国商店舒适地坐落在以英国皇室成员和殖民地官员命名的街道上，而英国法律、基督教和现代西医与传统中医、数百座中国寺庙、众多宗教节日和仪式以及对风水（风水学，即人与自然之间的平衡）的虔诚信仰和谐共存。风水甚至被应用于最现代的西式建筑以及2005年开业的新迪士尼乐园中。在这个开放空间如此稀少的地区，另一项英国遗产——香港最受欢迎的消遣活动——尤为引人注目："香港岛跑马地"和"新界沙田"的赛马，深受当地居民的喜爱，并受到“一国两制”模式的保护。 +

Hong Kong’s historical relationship with China and Britain also has its human legacies. +
This relationship produced a community of Chinese residents who have often distinguished themselves as a special group of Chinese and as different from their counterparts on the mainland. +
Although many scholars have seen this sense of Hong Kong identity as a relatively recent phenomenon, it took root in the late 1800s when the Chinese in Hong Kong contrasted the order and prosperity there against the political chaos and economic backwardness of China. +
The Chinese and expatriate communities of Hong Kong still live largely separate lives as they have for more than 150 years, with most expatriates rarely bothering to learn how to speak Chinese. +
All expatriates come into frequent contact with Chinese people at work, but it is still not uncommon for Chinese to have never met any Westerners, to whom they frequently refer as “foreign devils.” +
香港与中国和英国的历史关系也留下了人文遗产。这种关系造就了一个华人居民群体，他们常常将自己视为一个特殊的群体，与大陆的华人有所区别。尽管许多学者认为这种香港身份认同感是相对较新的现象，但它实际上早在19世纪末就已形成。当时，香港的华人将香港的秩序和繁荣与中国大陆的政治混乱和经济落后进行了对比。150多年来，香港的华人社区和外籍人士社区仍然过着相对独立的生活方式，大多数外籍人士很少费心学习中文。所有外籍人士在工作中都会频繁接触到华人，但华人从未见过任何西方人的情况仍然并不少见，他们常常称西方人为“外国魔鬼”。 +

- feat：名词，意为 "功绩、壮举、技艺"。

所以，直译是："绝非平庸的功绩"。即, "并非易事" 或 "绝非轻而易举的事"。

这个短语用 双重否定 (no+ 带负面意义的 mean)​ 来构成强烈的肯定，强调某事 非常困难、需要高超技能或巨大努力才能完成，是一项了不起的成就。

- Building a company from scratch is *no mean feat*.（白手起家创建一家公司, 绝非易事。）

Just as Hog Kong’s history between China and Britain had its own unique characteristics, so did its decolonization in 1997. +
Hardly a colonial embarrassment, the region had become more economically advanced than most independent countries. +
Apart from being a major financial center, by the end of British rule Hong Kong held the world’s seventh-largest foreign reserves and was the world’s third-largest exporter of clothing—no mean feat given the region’s small size. +
It had the second-highest per capita gross domestic product in Asia (after Japan), having passed that of Australia, Britain, and Canada. +
Rather than being granted independence, Hong Kong was turned over to a considerably more authoritarian government than the colonial one that had ruled for so long, a point that became glaringly obvious after the brutal crackdown in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in June 1989. +
Nor did the Communist government of China, dedicated though it was to ending imperialism around the globe, ever try to liberate Hong Kong. +
The main cause for the termination of colonial rule was also very different than in most colonies. +
The impetus was neither internal demand (far from it, for most Hong Kong residents preferred British colonial rule to Chinese rule) nor international pressure. +
Rather, the decision came from the Chinese government, which in 1972 had declared Hong Kong’s future a purely internal Chinese matter to be resolved when the government decided the time was right. +
By the time the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong’s future was signed in 1984, the British Empire, over which the sun never set, had long faded into the imperial sunset. +
China, however, was on its way to becoming a world power. +
正如香港与中国和英国的历史有着其独特的特征一样，其1997年的非殖民化也同样如此。香港并非殖民时代的耻辱，其经济发展水平甚至超过了大多数独立国家。除了是重要的金融中心之外，到英国统治结束时，香港拥有世界第七大外汇储备，并且是世界第三大服装出口地——考虑到香港的面积，这绝非易事。香港的人均国内生产总值在亚洲排名第二（仅次于日本），超过了澳大利亚、英国和加拿大。然而，香港并没有获得独立，而是被移交给了一个比长期统治香港的殖民政府更加专制的政府，这一点在1989年6月北京天安门广场的残酷镇压之后变得尤为明显。尽管中国共产党政府致力于在全球范围内结束帝国主义，但它从未试图解放香港。香港结束殖民统治的主要原因也与大多数殖民地截然不同。推动香港摆脱殖民统治的既非内部诉求（恰恰相反，大多数香港居民更倾向于英国殖民统治而非中国统治），也非国际压力。相反，这一决定来自中国政府。早在1972年，中国政府就宣布香港的未来纯属中国内政，待时机成熟时再行解决。到1984年《中英香港联合声明》签署之时，曾经的“日不落帝国”——大英帝国——早已落下帷幕。而中国，则正朝着世界强国的方向迈进。
