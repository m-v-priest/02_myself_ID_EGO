|Pax​
|这里的 Pax​ 源于拉丁语，本意为“和平、秩序、安定”，是古罗马时期常用的政治术语（如 Pax Romana​ 指“罗马治下的和平”）。

|Mongolica
|Mongolica​ 是拉丁语形容词形式，意为“蒙古的”或“与蒙古有关的”，属于专业历史术语的拉丁化构词。

|Pax Mongolica
|Pax Mongolica​ 是一个拉丁文历史专有名词，直译为“蒙古治下的和平”，特指13至14世纪蒙古帝国建立庞大统治后，在其控制区域内形成的相对和平、交通与贸易畅通的时期。

类似构造的术语还有 Pax Americana（美国治下的和平）、Pax Britannica（英国治下的和平）等。

英国在中国的崛起，最终导致香港的殖民统治，这只是始于15世纪末、持续到第一次世界大战后的欧洲扩张史的一部分。唐代（618-907年）和元代，欧洲商人经由丝绸之路——连接中国西北边疆与中东的陆路贸易路线——来到中国。在蒙古统治时期（即“蒙古治世”），中国和亚洲大部分地区被蒙古人统治，许多欧洲人到访中国进行贸易，其中一些人甚至为元朝政府效力。然而，14世纪中期元朝灭亡后，中国与欧洲的联系就很少了。 +

.Matteo Ricci

Matteo Ricci 马泰奥·里奇 (利玛窦) :(1552 年 10 月 6 日－1610 年 5 月 11 日）是一位意大利耶稣会神父 ，也是耶稣会中国传教事业的创始人之一。他创作了《 坤宇万国全图》 ，这是一幅用汉字书写的 1602 年世界地图。

利玛窦于 1582 年抵达葡萄牙殖民地澳门， 并在那里开始了他在中国的传教工作。

1601 年，他应万历皇帝之邀进入北京紫禁城 ，成为首位进入紫禁城的欧洲人。 +

他强调天主教与儒家思想的相似之处，但反对佛教 。他使多位中国显要官员皈依天主教。他还与徐光启等中国精英合作，首次将欧几里得的《几何原本》 翻译成中文，并将儒家经典翻译成拉丁文 。

Western merchants reentered the Chinese scene in the early 1500s when the Portuguese began trading along the southern China coast, a commercial region with a long tradition of overseas and intra-Chinese trade.  +
Partly as a reward for their help in suppressing piracy and partly as a way to confine them to a specific locale, the Ming government allowed the Portuguese in 1557 to establish a permanent settlement at Macau (now written Macao), a small peninsula to the southwest of Hong Kong.  +
Although the Qing banned overseas trade, Macau soon became the center of a “hemispheric exchange of commodities.”4 Chinese goods such as silk, tea, and porcelain made their way from Macau to Europe in Portuguese galleons in exchange for silver from mines in Japan and the Americas.  +
Through the efforts of European missionaries such as Matteo Ricci, Macau also became a base for the introduction of Christianity and Western learning to China.
16 世纪初，随着葡萄牙人开始在中国南部沿海地区进行贸易，西方商人重新进入中国市场。该地区拥有悠久的海外及中国内陆贸易传统。为了感谢葡萄牙人协助打击海盗，同时也为了限制他们的活动范围，明政府于 1557 年允许葡萄牙人在澳门（今澳门）建立永久定居点。澳门位于香港西南，是一个狭长的半岛。尽管清政府禁止海外贸易，澳门很快成为“半球商品交换”的中心。丝绸、茶叶和瓷器等中国商品经由葡萄牙大帆船从澳门运往欧洲，换取来自日本和美洲矿山的白银。在利玛窦等欧洲传教士的努力下，澳门也成为基督教和西方学术传入中国的基地。 +

到了 17 世纪，英国开始挑战葡萄牙和荷兰，成为亚洲主要的欧洲贸易强国。随着英国船只最终驶入中国水域，1654 年，葡萄牙允许英国东印度公司（EIC）在澳门登陆。1684 年清政府解除海外贸易禁令后，英国商人以澳门为总部，在黄埔港进行贸易。黄埔是位于中国南方最重要的海港广州以南约十英里的一座河中岛屿，欧洲人称之为黄埔。1771 年，东印度公司获准在广州设立商站。1759 年，清政府宣布广州为中国唯一合法的海外贸易港口。 +

Under what became known as the Canton System, or the Cohong System, China’s international trade was conducted through a group of Chinese hongs, or merchant houses, specially authorized and licensed by the Qing government.  +
(The word “cohong” comes from gonghang, meaning “officially authorized firms.”) Western merchants traded in Canton from October to March, confined to factories, or manufactories, rented from the Chinese hongs.  +
Named after similar centers in British India where the EIC’s agents or factors operated, these were the warehouses and residences along the riverfront outside Canton.  +
During the off-season, from April to September, the merchants returned to trade in Macau.  +
Although the foreigners frequently complained about the restrictions and conditions in Canton, these inconveniences were minor compared to the fortunes that could be made in silk, porcelain, tea, and, later, opium.  +
Even though several British diplomatic missions in the late 1700s and early 1800s failed to secure greater trading concessions and diplomatic rights from the Qing government, by the early 1840s almost one hundred foreign trading firms were trading on the southern China coast.
在后来被称为“广州制度”或“商行制度”的体系下，中国的国际贸易是通过一群由清政府特别授权和许可的商行（或称“商行”）进行的。（“商行”一词源于 “公行”， 意为“官方授权的商铺”。）西方商人每年 10 月至次年 3 月在广州进行贸易，他们被限制在从商行租用的商铺或作坊内。这些商铺或作坊的名称源于英属印度东印度公司代理人或代理商所在的类似中心，它们位于广州城外的江边，既是仓库，也是商铺。在淡季，即 4 月至 9 月，商人们则返回澳门进行贸易。尽管外国人经常抱怨广州的种种限制和条件，但与丝绸、瓷器、茶叶以及后来的鸦片贸易所能带来的巨额财富相比，这些不便显得微不足道。尽管 18 世纪末 19 世纪初英国的几个外交使团未能从清政府获得更大的贸易特权和外交权利，但到 19 世纪 40 年代初，已有近百家外国贸易公司在中国南方沿海地区进行贸易。 +

British historians have often stressed how the acquisition of Hong Kong, like much of the expansion of the British Empire, was almost an accident.  +
Britain, so the standard argument goes, took Hong Kong not to obtain more territory but rather to promote and protect its commercial interests in China.  +
Hong Kong, explained Secretary for the Colonies Lord Stanley in 1843, was “occupied not with a view to colonization, but for diplomatic, commercial and military purposes.” +
G.B.Endacott, until the 1970s the foremost historian of Hong Kong, wrote, “A healthy trade demanded settled conditions, suppression of robbery, guarantee of contract and of impartial justice.  +
Since the Chinese were thought to be unable to provide these conditions, the British had to provide them.  +
This is fundamental to understanding any history of Hong Kong.”
英国历史学家经常强调，英国​​吞并香港，如同大英帝国扩张的大部分历程一样，几乎是一次偶然事件。通常的论点是，英国占领香港并非为了获取更多领土，而是为了促进和保护其在中国的商业利益。殖民地事务大臣史丹利勋爵在 1843 年解释说，占领香港“并非出于殖民目的，而是出于外交、商业和军事目的”。 5 直到 20 世纪 70 年代，香港史研究的权威学者 G.B.恩达科特写道：“健康的贸易需要稳定的环境、杜绝抢劫、保障合同以及公正的司法。由于人们认为中国人无法提供这些条件，英国不得不提供。这对于理解香港史至关重要。” 6 +

Hong Kong was indeed founded primarily as an imperial outpost rather than to civilize or Christianize its Chinese residents.  +
After the British first occupied Hong Kong in 1839 during the First Opium War with China, few British officials considered seriously the idea of Hong Kong as a permanent colony.  +
(It would not formally become a colony until June 26, 1843.) Even after the British took formal control of Hong Kong in 1841 under the short-lived Convention of Chuenpi (which both sides considered so unsatisfactory that some scholars wonder if the treaty was even signed), British officials held differing and often conflicting views about Hong Kong’s potential.  +
Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston did not think the island worthwhile, while his successor, Lord Aberdeen, believed that keeping Hong Kong would be too expensive and would harm Britain’s relations with China and other European countries.  +
However, Charles Elliot, British superintendent of trade in China and first administrator of colonial Hong Kong, was convinced that Hong Kong would be the perfect base for British commercial, military, and political operations in China.  +
Henry Pottinger, Elliot’s successor and the first governor of Hong Kong, was also convinced that Britain needed a base on the China coast.  +
Although he was initially skeptical, Pottinger eventually agreed with Elliot on Hong Kong’s commercial and military value.  +
In general, officials in London were much less enthusiastic about Hong Kong’s worth than were those based in Hong Kong and southern China.
香港的建立初衷并非为了教化或基督教化其华人居民，而主要是为了作为帝国的前哨。1839年，英国在第一次鸦片战争期间占领香港后，鲜有英国官员认真考虑过将香港作为永久殖民地的想法。（直到1843年6月26日，香港才正式成为英国殖民地。）即使在1841年英国根据短暂的《全庇条约》（双方都认为该条约极其不尽如人意，以至于一些学者怀疑该条约是否真的签署过）正式控制香港之后，英国官员对香港的潜力仍然持有不同甚至相互矛盾的看法。外交大臣帕默斯顿勋爵认为香港不值得保留，而他的继任者阿伯丁勋爵则认为，保留香港代价过高，而且会损害英国与中国和其他欧洲国家的关系。然而，英国驻华贸易总监兼香港首任行政长官查尔斯·艾略特坚信，香港将是英国在中国开展商业、军事和政治活动的理想基地。艾略特的继任者、香港首任总督亨利·波廷格也认为英国需要在中国沿海地区设立基地。尽管波廷格最初持怀疑态度，但他最终还是认同了艾略特关于香港商业和军事价值的看法。总的来说，伦敦官员对香港的价值远不如香港和华南地区的官员们那么热情。 +

The British acquisition of Hong Kong, however, was no accident; it was “the outcome of a long crusade by British free traders to promote trade with China.”7 British interest in a reliable trading base on the China coast dated back almost as far as the British presence in Asia.  +
Unlike the other European maritime empires of Holland, Portugal, and Spain that had bases in Batavia (today’s Jakarta), Macau, and Manila, respectively, Britain had no significant territory in Asia outside of India.  +

James Matheson, head of Jardine and Matheson, the largest British firm operating in the region, urged the British government to establish a base for protecting British trading interests in southern China.
然而，英国对香港的占领并非偶然；它是“英国自由贸易商长期致力于促进与中国贸易的结果”。 7 英国对在中国沿海建立可靠贸易基地的兴趣几乎与英国在亚洲的存在一样久远。与其他分别在巴达维亚（今雅加达）、澳门和马尼拉设有基地的欧洲海上帝国——荷兰、葡萄牙和西班牙不同，英国在印度以外没有在亚洲拥有重要的领土。1815 年，一位东印度公司驻广州的官员呼吁英国在尽可能靠近首都北京的地方建立一个基地。1821 年，广州当局将非法鸦片贸易从黄埔驱逐出去后，英国商人开始在包括香港在内的几个沿海岛屿上设立贸易站。1834 年 8 月，英国驻华贸易总监纳皮尔勋爵提议派遣一支小规模的英国军队占领香港岛，以确保欧洲在中国的贸易权。在华南地区运营的英国最大公司怡和集团的负责人詹姆斯·马西森敦促英国政府建立一个基地，以保护英国在华南的贸易利益。 +

尽管包括台湾（大多数外国人称之为福尔摩沙）在内的其他几个岛屿通常被认为更具吸引力，但广州的英国商人更青睐香港的深水港。香港港免受台风侵袭，且与中国大陆和公海交通便利。英国植物学家兼探险家罗伯特·福琼曾于 1843 年和 1845 年到访香港，他总结了香港港的优点：“香港湾是我见过的最美的海湾之一：长约八到十英里，宽度不规则；有的地方宽两英里，有的地方宽六英里，整个海湾都拥有绝佳的锚地，而且完全没有隐患。它南面完全被香港的山脉所环绕，对岸则被中国大陆的山脉所保护；实际上，它四面都是内陆；因此，船只可以安然无恙地度过最猛烈的风暴。” 8 +
