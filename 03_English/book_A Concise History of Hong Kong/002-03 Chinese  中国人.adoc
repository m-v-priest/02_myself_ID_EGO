这些人违反了广东当局禁止与外国人一起工作的命令，这既表明了中国的恶劣环境，也表明了英国殖民统治提供的机会。

.That these people violated (v.) _orders_ from authorities in Canton _against working with foreigners_

这是一个由 That引导的主语从句，充当整个句子的主语。
其核心是 these people violated orders。 +

- from authorities in Canton是 orders的后置定语。
- a gainst working with foreigners是 orders的另一个后置定语，解释命令的内容是“反对/禁止与外国人合作”。

.against + doing 表示 “反对 / 禁止做某事”

- against working with foreigners 禁止与外国人合作
- He is against smoking. 他反对吸烟。
- The rule is against driving after drinking. 这条规定,禁止酒后驾车。

Even after the influx (n.)大量涌入；流入 of wealthy Chinese families during the Taiping Rebellion, `主` most Chinese in Hong Kong `系` were men who left their families in China.  +
In the mid-1850s, only one-fourth to one-third of Hong Kong’s population was female.  +

Given 考虑到 the colonial government’s concerns (n.) about *maintaining (v.) order* among its Chinese subjects 国民；臣民, we have a better idea of how Chinese society in early Hong Kong was organized, and these organizations *in turn* shed (v.) light on 阐明；使……清楚地显出 the opportunities and problems facing the Chinese population.  +

鉴于殖民政府担心在其华人臣民中维持秩序，我们便能更好地了解早期香港华人社会的组织方式，而这些组织反过来 又揭示了华人群体所面临的机遇与问题。

One important feature of the Chinese social structure in early Hong Kong `系` was temples 寺庙；神殿 such as the _Man Mo Temple_ 文武庙, which was dedicated to 致力于；专门用于 the worship (n.)崇拜；礼拜 of the gods of literature 文学 and war.  +

Another early temple, the _Kwong Fook 广福 Yee Chee_ 义祠, was a place where Chinese could worship (v.)崇拜；祭拜 their ancestors.

.Kwong Fook 广福 Yee Chee​ 义祠
DeepSeek: “义祠”​ 特指一种慈善性质的祠堂，其主要功能并非供奉特定神祇，而是为那些在海外去世后无人祭拜、或无亲无故的华人先侨提供集体灵位，进行祭祀，使其灵魂有所归依，不至成为孤魂野鬼。

gemini: “义”指义务、公益；“祠”指祠堂或供奉先人的地方。合起来就是由社会公义集资兴建、专门供奉无后,或客死异乡者灵位的祠堂。

这座建筑位于上环太平山街（Tai Ping Shan Street），它在 19 世纪的香港扮演了三个令人唏嘘的角色：

- 供奉祖先的家庙：*早年来港谋生的华人, 大多是单身男性，如果死在香港且没有后人祭奠，灵魂就会变成“孤魂野鬼”。"广福义祠"允许他们在这里安放灵位（神主牌），让同乡代为祭祀。*
- 病人的终点站：由于当时华人居住区极度拥挤且缺乏医疗，**许多身患重病（如肺结核或瘟疫）的华工会被赶出宿舍。广福义祠成了他们的临时收容所(临终关怀医院)。许多人在祠堂阴暗的角落里躺着等死，**因此它在当时也被称为“百姓庙”。
- 东华医院的起源：1869年，*港英政府官员和欧洲居民发现"广福义祠"内尸体与病人混杂、卫生条件极其恐怖（震惊了当时的英国社区）。这一丑闻直接促使了华人领袖集资兴建了##香港第一所现代中医医院——东华医院（Tung Wah Hospital）。##*

東華三院"廣福祠"正式列作法定古蹟
——傳承歷史文脈，彰顯慈善精神

廣福祠約於1856年落成，**#原為供奉"客死香港的華人"靈位，其後逐漸成為病重者暫居之所。1869年，該祠的衛生情況引起政府關注，從而促成了"東華醫院"的創立，#**成為香港華人慈善醫療服務的重要起點。自東華三院成立以來，廣福祠一直由該院負責管理及修繕，並於2024年獲評為一級歷史建築。

Most of the Chinese who came to Hong Kong in the early years were from the lower classes, such as laborers, artisans, Tanka outcasts, prostitutes, wanderers, and smugglers.  +
That these people violated orders from authorities in Canton against working with foreigners suggests both the dismal conditions in China and the opportunities that British colonial rule offered.  +
Even after the influx of wealthy Chinese families during the Taiping Rebellion, most Chinese in Hong Kong were men who left their families in China.  +
In the mid-1850s, only one-fourth to one-third of Hong Kong’s population was female.  +
Given the colonial government’s concerns about maintaining order among its Chinese subjects, we have a better idea of how Chinese society in early Hong Kong was organized, and these organizations in turn shed light on the opportunities and problems facing the Chinese population.  +
One important feature of the Chinese social structure in early Hong Kong was temples such as the Man Mo Temple, which was dedicated to the worship of the gods of literature and war.  +
Another early temple, the Kwong Fook Yee Chee, was a place where Chinese could worship their ancestors.
由于我们对中国工人阶级和中产阶级的了解大多来自殖民时期的记录，即使是对早期香港社会最深入的研究也难以揭示太多信息，例如家庭生活或物质文化。早期来到香港的华人大多来自社会底层，例如劳工、工匠、弃儿、妓女、流浪者和走私者。这些人违反广州当局禁止与外国人共事的命令，既反映了当时中国的社会状况十分糟糕，也体现了英国殖民统治所带来的机遇。即使在太平天国运动期间大量富裕华人家庭涌入之后，香港的华人也大多是男性，他们把家人留在了中国。19世纪50年代中期，香港人口中只有四分之一到三分之一是女性。鉴于殖民政府对维护其华人臣民秩序的重视，我们对早期香港华人社会的组织结构有了更清晰的认识，而这些组织结构反过来又揭示了华人所面临的机遇和挑战。早期香港华人社会结构的一个重要特征是寺庙，例如文武庙，它供奉着文武神。另一座早期寺庙广福益池寺，则是华人祭祀祖先的地方。 +

Hong Kong’s early history is replete (a.)充满的；遍布的 with examples of how working-class Chinese learned (v.) to organize to protect their interests.  +
Workers, artisans 工匠；手艺人, and shopkeepers 店主，店铺老板 often *went on strike* 举行罢工 to protest (v.)（公开）反对，抗议 ordinances 法令；条例 `后定说明` to regulate (v.) or license 给……发许可证；批准 their trades.  +

[.my2]
工人、工匠和店主经常举行罢工，抗议"对他们的行业进行管理,或颁发许可证"的法令。

Although these strikes rarely achieved (v.) their goals, they are evidence of _a growing sense_ of collective 集体的；共同的 action.  +

In 1891, for example, carpenters 木匠 *went on strike* for better wages, while _rattan (n.)藤；藤条 chair makers_ *struck* (v.) for _shorter work hours_.  +

The coopers’ 制桶工人 guild 行会；同业公会 *went on strike* four times from 1894 to 1895 /after some of its members were dismissed 解雇；免职 and replaced by outsiders.  +

`主` Whether these examples of collective action `谓` were motivated 激励；激发；使产生动机 by _hatred (n.)憎恨；憎恶；仇恨 for the British_ or by _economic concern_ `系` is hard to determine 确定；查明；判定.  +

Some historians have tried to demonstrate 证明；证实；论证 that /these actions were *either* examples of a nascent (a.)新生的；萌芽的 Chinese patriotism 爱国主义；爱国精神 *or* acts of economic self-interest, but *realities 现实 are never so neat* 简单的；整洁的；有条不紊的.  +

While some strikes had anti-British overtones (n.)暗示；弦外之音；言外之意, others *were based primarily 主要地；首要地 on* protecting livelihoods 生计；谋生手段, and still others `系` were mainly resistance (n.)抵抗；反抗；反对 to British efforts to control (v.) and regulate (v.) the Chinese population.

香港早期历史充满了华人劳动阶级组织起来维护自身利益的例子。工人、工匠和店主经常举行罢工，抗议旨在规范或颁发执照的行业法令。尽管这些罢工鲜少达成目标，但它们体现了日益增强的集体行动意识。例如，1891年，木匠为争取更高的工资而罢工，藤椅工匠则为缩短工时而罢工。1894年至1895年间，由于部分成员被解雇并由外来人员取代，制桶匠行会四次举行罢工。这些集体行动的动机究竟是出于对英国的仇恨还是经济考量，难以断定。一些历史学家试图证明，这些行动要么是萌芽中的华人爱国主义的体现，要么是出于经济利益的考量，但事实远比这复杂得多。虽然有些罢工带有反英色彩，但另一些罢工主要是为了保护生计，还有一些罢工主要是为了抵抗英国控制和规范华人人口的努力。 +

回顾1884年的反法运动。19世纪50年代末至60年代初，法国以保护天主教传教士及其信徒为名，向越南派遣军队。1874年，法国强迫越南签署条约后，越南（历史上曾是中国的属地）请求中国帮助抵抗法国的入侵。到了19世纪80年代初，中法军队在中越边境地区爆发零星冲突。1884年8月，法军进攻台湾和沿海城市浦州，中国南方民众随即袭击欧洲人并焚毁教堂。在香港，中文报刊刊登有关中法冲突以及台湾和福州遭袭的新闻，从而增强了民众的民族意识。1884年9月中旬，紧张局势进一步升级，殖民政府无视中国商人的请愿，允许法国海军舰艇使用香港港口进行补给和维修。 +

Although the anti-French strike was partly based on Chinese nationalism, it was considerably more complex.  +
Officials in Beijing were anxious that the situation not get out of control.  +
They relied on loans from Hong Kong banks to finance the war and depended on weapons and munitions imported through the colony, and they did not want to risk Britain teaming up with France.  +
But authorities in Canton had issued proclamations forbidding Chinese to work for the French, offering rewards of official titles to anyone who killed French troops or destroyed French munitions and threatening to execute traitors and to punish their relatives.  +
The strike shows that although the Chinese workforce was often divided, it could come together when threatened by outsiders.  +
However, the strike also shows that labor solidarity and nationalism were limited, for activists often had to use force to coerce reluctant workers to participate in the strike.  +
When Chinese authorities tried to get triads and secret societies involved by offering them monetary rewards, these groups helped lead the riots and intimidated workers who did not strike.  +
Striking workers, many of whom were afraid of recrimination against their relatives in Guangdong, coerced others into joining the strike.
尽管反法罢工部分源于中国民族主义，但其背景远比这复杂得多。北京官员担心局势失控。他们依靠香港银行的贷款来资助战争，依赖经由香港进口的武器弹药，不愿冒英国与法国结盟的风险。然而，广州当局却颁布公告，禁止中国人为法国人工作，并悬赏官职奖励任何杀害法军或摧毁法军弹药的人，同时威胁要处决叛徒并惩罚其亲属。这次罢工表明，尽管中国工人阶级内部常常存在分歧，但在受到外来威胁时，他们也能团结起来。然而，罢工也暴露出劳工团结和民族主义的局限性，因为活动人士常常不得不使用武力来胁迫不愿参与罢工的工人。当中国当局试图通过提供金钱奖励来拉拢黑社会和秘密社团时，这些组织反而助长了骚乱，并恐吓那些没有参与罢工的工人。许多罢工工人担心广东的亲属会遭到报复，于是强迫其他人加入罢工。 +

|With a government  determined (a.) to run its colony...   +
#我问: 这里的 determined 是做谓语, 还是做后置定语 ?#
|这是一个由 with 引导的独立主格结构，表示伴随状况或原因.

在这个句子中，determined​是形容词, 意思是“坚决的，下定决心的，有决心的”。

为什么是 determined 而不是 determining？

- ##**determined (adj.)：表示“已经下定决心的”，强调一种既定的、坚决的状态。**##政府已经做出了“低成本运营”的决定，并且态度坚决。
- ##**determining (v-ing)：表示“正在做决定”，强调动作正在进行。**##如果这里用 determining，意思就变成了“一个正在做决定的政府”，这显然不符合逻辑，因为原文强调的是政府“已经决定”并“坚持”这种政策。

determined​ 在这里是形容词，作后置定语，修饰前面的名词 government。它描述的是“政府”所具有的“坚决的、铁了心的”状态，而不是一个被动的动作。

|#我继续问: 如果determined做后置定语, government 就没有谓语存在了呀?#
|▶ DeepSeek:
government 确实没有谓语动词。#*因为 With 引导的是独立主格结构.*#

整个句子主干是：
These people​ (主语) had to rely​ (谓语动词) on themselves...

而 “With a government determined to run...”​ 这一整部分，并不是一个完整的句子，而是一个由介词 With​ 引导的独立主格结构（或称为“介词复合结构”）。

- 功能：##**这种结构在句子中充当状语，用于说明主句动作发生的背景、原因或伴随状况。它本身不包含谓语动词，**##其核心是一个“名词/代词 + 修饰成分”的组合。
- #*公式：With + 名词 + 修饰成分（分词、形容词、介词短语等）*#

government并不是这个状语结构的主语，它只是介词 With的宾语。##**这个结构的目的是把“一个决心以最低成本运行其殖民地的政府”这个名词性概念, 作为背景信息引入，而不是陈述“政府做了某事”这个动作。**##主句的主语和谓语 (These people had to rely) 才是句子的核心。


如果 government需要谓语，句子会怎么写？ +
如果想让 government 做主语并拥有谓语，原句需要彻底改写，例如：

The government *was determined*​(v.) to run its colony as cheaply as possible, so these people​ had to rely on themselves...  +
（政府决心...，因此这些人不得不...）

- 写成定语从句：
With a government `后定说明` _that was determined​(v.) to run its colony..._, these people had to rely... +
（一个决心...的政府）

'''

▶ gemini 回答:

determined 在这里是后置定语（形容词化的过去分词），表状态，而非被动动作。

*这是一个由 With 引导的伴随状语（或原因状语）开头的句子。*

状语部分： With a government [determined to...] and [taking...] +
主句主语： these people +
主句谓语： had to rely

#*所以，government 在这里并不是主句的主语，它只是介词 with 的宾语。 既然它不是主语，那么跟在它后面的 determined 自然就不可能是谓语了。*#

为什么用 determined 而不是 determining？ +
这涉及到了“动作”与“状态”的区别。

- *#Determining (正在决定/起决定作用的)：  现在分词 (Active) , 强调“动作正在进行”或“主动导致某结果”。#*
- *#Determined (下定决心的/坚决的)： 过去分词/形容词 (State) , 强调“已经下定决心”，描述主语的心理状态或性质。#*

在这个句子里，政府不是“正在做决定”，而是“抱有一种坚决的初衷/态度”去统治殖民地。所以，determined 在这里几乎已经变成了一个形容词，意思是“意志坚定的”、“下定决心的”。

- 如果你用了 determining： 听起来像是这个政府**正在做“运行殖民地”这个实验，**或者它正在起到某种决定性作用。
- 使用了 determined： 刻画的是一个“顽固、铁了心要省钱”的政府形象。


"A man *determin##ed##* to win." (一个志在必得的人) → *强调他##内心的坚决##。* +
"A man *determin##ing##* the winner." (一个决定胜负的人) → *强调他在行使权力的##动作##。*

在英语中，很多描写心理状态的词，习惯用过去分词形式来表达**“处于某种状态中”**。
例如：

- interested (感兴趣的) → 不是被别人感兴趣，而是自己处于“感兴趣”的状态。
- worried (担心的) → 处于“担心”的状态。
- determined (下定决心的) → 处于“决心已定”的状态。

#*我们可以套用一个简单的公式来理解这种 With 复合结构：   +
With + 宾语 (n.) + 宾语补足语 (adj./participle)*#


在这个句子中：
宾语是 a government。
它有两个补足语：

- determined to run... (形容词短语，#*表心态/性质*#)
- taking so little interest... (现在分词短语，#*表伴随动作/行为*#)

##**这里作者用了一个 ed 和一个 ing，**##其实非常高级：

- 用 determin##**ed 交代政府的执政方针（状态）。**##
- 用 tak##**ing 描写政府的具体表现（动作）。**##

我问: 这里为什么用了 had preferred, 而不是直接用 preferred ?

▶ DeepSeek:

这里使用 had preferred（过去完成时）而不是 preferred（一般过去时），#*是为了在时间线上进行“过去的过去”的对比，强调这种“偏好”是在“香港商人扮演角色”这一历史事件发生之前, 就已经长期存在的传统。*#

image:/img/svg 001.svg[,100%]

用 had preferred：清晰地表明“中国内地的历史偏好”是先于“后来不得不在香港扮演...”存在的。

**如果用 preferred：会让人误以为“中国民众的偏好”和“香港商人的扮演”是同时发生的，这不符合历史事实。**因为香港没有科举, 逼得商人不得不去模仿早已存在的旧有模式。

Although these organizations were similar to those found in China and among overseas Chinese communities, they were also particular to Hong Kong’s geographical and political situation.  +
With a government determined to run its colony as cheaply as possible and taking so little interest in its Chinese subjects, these people had to rely on themselves and personal networks and to foster their own leadership to represent their needs and interests.  +
Whereas in China the avenue to social success was through the civil service examination, no such system existed in Hong Kong.  +
Chinese businessmen thus had to find other ways of transferring their wealth and prestige among the local Chinese community.  +
This they did by assuming the role traditionally played by the local gentry in China, where historically people had preferred to rely on extralegal authorities such as village elders or local elites to resolve disputes.  +
Finally, Hong Kong’s close proximity to China meant that the turbulent conditions in China could benefit merchants in Hong Kong.
尽管这些组织与中国大陆及海外华人社区的组织类似，但它们也具有香港特有的地理和政治特点。由于政府决心尽可能降低殖民地的运营成本，且对香港华人漠不关心，这些人不得不依靠自身的力量和人脉关系，并培养自己的领导力量来代表他们的需求和利益。在中国，科举制度是通往社会成功的途径，但在香港却并不存在。因此，华人商人必须另辟蹊径，在当地华人社区中传播财富和声望。他们通过扮演传统上由中国地方士绅扮演的角色来实现这一点。历史上，人们更倾向于依靠村中长老或地方精英等法外权威来解决纠纷。最后，香港与中国大陆的地理位置接近，这意味着中国大陆的动荡局势反而可能使香港的商人受益。 +

这些华人志愿组织中最早的是文武庙，由卢亚奎和林亚翠（我们在第一章中提到过）于1847年创立。虽然其表面上的目的是祭祀文武之神和宗教节日，但文武庙还承担着其他重要职能。它很快成为香港华人的主要社交中心，无论他们来自哪个地区或从事何种职业。文武庙也逐渐发展成为华人社区的非正式自治机构，商户们选举委员会来处理纠纷。因此，在文武庙和较小的邻里委员会的共同作用下，华人社区很快发展出管理自身事务的机制。尽管欧洲殖民者常常怀疑文武庙暗中控制着“本地事务”，但殖民政府却乐见其成，因为这符合政府以低成本统治华人的政策。 +

- ...as the group #*was to be funded*#...  因为这个团体**#（按计划/按规定）是要#**由华人社区资助的（#*强调一种预设的安排和性质*#）。

作者使用 was to be funded 是为了强调：“资助这笔钱”这件事，从一开始就是作为一种“制度安排”或“共同意向”定下来的。 正是因为有了这个“必须由华人自己出钱”的前提，政府才由此推断出：这证明了华人富商们有了更强的“公民责任感”。

|#*使用 -ing 形式, 能给读者一种身临其境的画面感。它像是一张现场快照，捕捉到了调查人员推开门那一刻看到的视觉景象。*#

- 如果是用 lying： 强调的是当时的状态和情景。读者的脑海里会浮现出尸体和病人横七竖八躺在那里的惨状。
- *如果用定语从句 who lay： 听起来更像是在陈述一个枯燥的历史事实，而不是在描述一个震撼的现场。*

想象你是一个摄影师，revealed ... lying 就是你按下一瞬间快门得到的照片；而普通的谓语动词更像是事后写的文字记录。

|3.“Lie” 的特殊性质：只有主动，没有被动
|你可能会想：尸体是被放在那里的，为什么不用被动形式（过去分词）？

*因为Lie (躺) 是一个不及物动词，它本身没有"被动语态"。无论是一个活人躺着，还是一个物体（或尸体）位于某处，在英语语境中，这都被视为一种“自动”的状态。* +
即使是尸体，在描述其“躺在某处”这一位置状态时，英语也习惯用主动的 lying。

The founding of the hospital says much about the abilities and resources of the Chinese elite, the history of medicine in Hong Kong, and the government’s and European community’s attitudes toward the local Chinese population.  +
Although disease had plagued Hong Kong from its early days, the colonial government was concerned primarily about the health of Hong Kong’s European population and of the European and Indian troops in the colonial garrison.  +
The Chinese population’s prejudice against Western medicine meant that very few Chinese sought treatment from the government’s limited medical facilities.  +

香港最重要的华人志愿组织是成立于1869年的东华医院。医院的创立充分体现了当时华人精英的能力和资源、香港的医学发展史，以及政府和欧洲社群对当地华人的态度。尽管疾病自香港建城之初就一直困扰着这里，但殖民政府主要关注的是香港的欧洲居民以及驻扎在殖民地的欧洲和印度士兵的健康。由于华人对西医的偏见，很少有华人会去政府有限的医疗机构就诊。1869年4月，一项调查揭露了广福益池祠堂内尸体和垂死病人并排躺着的景象。殖民政府和华人领袖都感到尴尬，并急于控制局面。不到两个月后，一群华人商人提出兴建一家华人医院，一个由约二十位颇具影响力的华人居民组成的医院委员会便成立了。委员会主席是何亚植；另一名买办梁安也发挥了积极作用。 +

As historian Elizabeth Sinn writes, however, “its work pervaded so many aspects of society that it became inevitably caught up in the most mundane as well as the most sensational matters”: caring for the destitute, sending corpses and remains back to China for proper burial, repatriating kidnapped laborers and women, and running an insane asylum.4 Equally important as the hospital’s medical, social, and charitable services were its community services.  +

东华医院于 1872 年正式成立，其主要目的是提供中医服务。然而，正如历史学家伊丽莎白·辛恩所写，“它的工作渗透到社会的方方面面，不可避免地卷入了最平凡也最轰动的事件”：照顾穷人、将尸体和遗骸送回中国妥善安葬、遣返被绑架的劳工和妇女，以及运营精神病院。 4.  +
与医院的医疗、社会和慈善服务同等重要的是其社区服务。医院成为华人社区的文化和社会中心，是华人聚集庆祝宗教节日的场所。由于不愿面对陌生的英国法律及其法院和腐败的办事员，许多华人更倾向于由医院委员会解决民事纠纷。此外，医院还为殖民政府提供了宝贵的服务，尤其是在 19 世纪中期广东华人移民人数激增的情况下，医院负责管理华人人口。 +
