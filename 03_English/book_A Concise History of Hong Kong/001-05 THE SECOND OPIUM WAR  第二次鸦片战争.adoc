.案例
====
In the midst of this uncertainty and insecurity, Hong Kong became embroiled in another war between Britain and China.  +
Most historians have focused on the Second Opium War primarily as yet another Sino-British conflict or on the war’s effects on Hong Kong.  +
However, both the war and its local repercussions were shaped not only by developments in Hong Kong and China but also by global events that affected the British Empire.  +
The underlying cause of the war was that the Treaty of Nanking had not given the British all that they wanted, whereas from the Qing point of view it had conceded too much.  +
Britain hoped the treaty would lead to more treaties that would eventually open China to foreign trade, primarily for the benefit of Britain but also for China and the world.  +
For the Qing, the treaty was simply a way to keep the foreigners at bay.  +
The treaty had not produced the boom in trade that the British had expected and had left too many issues unresolved.  +
Throughout the 1850s, Sino-British relations were plagued by the Canton question: the English text of the treaty gave the British the right to enter the city of Canton, but the Chinese text restricted them to its port.  +
Not only did the treaty not grant the British diplomatic residence in the capital at Beijing, but British officials did not have direct access to Chinese officials in Canton.
在这样动荡不安的局势下，香港卷入了英中之间的另一场战争。大多数历史学家将第二次鸦片战争主要视为又一场中英冲突，或侧重于战争对香港的影响。然而，这场战争及其在香港的余波，不仅受到香港和中国局势发展的影响，也受到影响大英帝国的全球事件的影响。战争的根本原因在于，《南京条约》未能满足英国的所有要求，而清政府则认为该条约让步过多。英国希望该条约能够促成更多条约的签订，最终打开中国对外贸易的大门，这主要有利于英国自身，但也惠及中国乃至世界。对清政府而言，该条约仅仅是阻止外国势力入侵的一种手段。该条约并未带来英国预期的贸易繁荣，反而遗留了诸多悬而未决的问题。整个19世纪50年代，中英关系都受到广州问题的困扰：条约的英文文本赋予英国人进入广州城的权利，而中文文本则将他们限制在广州港。该条约不仅没有赋予英国在首都北京设立外交机构的权利，而且英国官员也无法直接接触广州的中国官员。 +

Although it is not true, as it is often claimed, that the treaty 条约 did not even mention opium —Article 4 stipulated (v.)规定；约定 that /the “Emperor of China agrees to pay the sum 金额，款项 of Six Million Dollars as the value of Opium which *was delivered 递送；传送；交付；运载 up* 交出；交付；移交 at Canton in the month of March 1839” —the treaty did not discuss the opium trade or its legality 合法性；法律地位. +

Furthermore, the treaty made no provision 规定；条款 for future revisions 修订；修改. +
Because `主` the Treaty of Wanghia 望厦条约 `后定说明` signed between the United States and China in 1844 `谓` included _provision for revisions_ in twelve years, the British hoped that /they might use (v.) _the most-favored-nation clause_ 最惠国条款 in the Treaty of Nanking *to push for* 反复要求某事物,奋力争取 revisions. +

Most important, Britain’s global position *depended on* opium: Britain used the revenue 财政收入；收益 from the opium trade *to buy* tea and silk from China /and *to support* the occupation 占领；占据 of India, Chinese merchants 商人；批发商 used (v.) the profits 利润；收益 from tea and silk *to buy opium* from British traders, Indian producers used (v.) revenues from opium to buy British goods, and British merchants used (v.) the profits from selling British goods *to buy cotton* from the United States. +

The sale of _Indian opium_ to China, writes (v.) historian J.Y.Wong, ”was _a great link_ （链状物的）环，节 in the chain of commerce 商业；贸易 with which Britain had surrounded (v.)围绕；包围 the world.“ +

[.my2]
历史学家 J.Y. Wong写道，向中国出售印度鸦片,“是英国环绕全球的贸易链条中的重要一环”。

Thus, in 1854 the British requested more concessions 让步；特许权, including the legalization 合法化 of the opium trade, the freedom *to sail (v.) and trade* (v.) on the Yangzi River, and the right to _diplomatic representation_ 外交代表；外交使节 in Beijing.

.案例

Although it is not true, as it is often claimed, that the treaty did not even mention opium—Article 4 stipulated that the “Emperor of China agrees to pay the sum of Six Million Dollars as the value of Opium which was delivered up at Canton in the month of March 1839”—the treaty did not discuss the opium trade or its legality.  +
Furthermore, the treaty made no provision for future revisions.  +
Because the Treaty of Wanghia signed between the United States and China in 1844 included provision for revisions in twelve years, the British hoped that they might use the most-favored-nation clause in the Treaty of Nanking to push for revisions.  +
Most important, Britain’s global position depended on opium: Britain used the revenue from the opium trade to buy tea and silk from China and to support the occupation of India, Chinese merchants used the profits from tea and silk to buy opium from British traders, Indian producers used revenues from opium to buy British goods, and British merchants used the profits from selling British goods to buy cotton from the United States.  +
The sale of Indian opium to China, writes historian J.Y.Wong, ”was a great link in the chain of commerce with which Britain had surrounded the world.“20 Thus, in 1854 the British requested more concessions, including the legalization of the opium trade, the freedom to sail and trade on the Yangzi River, and the right to diplomatic representation in Beijing.
尽管并非如常人所言，该条约完全没有提及鸦片——第四条规定“中国皇帝同意支付六百万美元，作为 1839 年 3 月在广州交付的鸦片的价值”——但该条约确实没有讨论鸦片贸易及其合法性。此外，该条约也没有规定未来修订的条款。由于 1844 年美国与中国签订的《望家条约》规定了十二年后的修订条款，英国希望能够利用《南京条约》中的最惠国条款来推动条约的修订。最重要的是，英国的全球地位依赖于鸦片：英国利用鸦片贸易的收入从中国购买茶叶和丝绸，并支持其对印度的占领；中国商人利用茶叶和丝绸的利润从英国商人手中购买鸦片；印度生产者利用鸦片的收入购买英国商品；英国商人则利用出售英国商品的利润从美国购买棉花。历史学家黄俊耀（JY Wong）写道，印度鸦片对中国的出口“是英国环绕世界的贸易链条中的重要一环”。 20 因此，在 1854 年，英国要求获得更多让步，包括鸦片贸易合法化、在长江上航行和贸易的自由，以及在北京设立外交代表机构的权利。 +

.consul
a government official who is the representative of his or her country in a foreign city 领事

[.my3]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a,1a"]
|===
| 职位 | 核心身份 | 主要任务

| Consul (领事) | 派驻在某个城市的“事务官”。
| 照顾本国侨民、发签证、处理贸易杂事。

#*Consul 通常不驻扎在首都，而是在主要的商埠或大城市*#（比如 19 世纪的广州、厦门）。

职能： ##**他不负责两国的政治博弈，主要管的是“民生”和“生意”。**##比如：如果你在国外丢了护照，或者本国商船在码头被扣了，你就去找领事。

通俗比喻： 领事就像是“驻外办事处主任”。他是个管家，解决具体麻烦的。

| Ambassador (大使) | 国家元首派往另一国首都的“全权代表”。
| 负责国家间的高层政治关系、传话。

#*Ambassador (大使) —— “元首的传声筒”*# +
Ambassador 的级别非常高。在古代，大使被视为国王的化身，他的一言一行代表着国家元首。

职能： #*驻扎在对方首都，负责维护两国之间的整体关系。他要向对方的政府递交国书，参加国宴。*#

通俗比喻： 大使就像是**“元首的替身”**。他主要是去“刷脸”和“搞社交”的，维持两家人的面子和交情。

| Plenipotentiary (全权代表) | 拥有“代笔签名权”的特殊代理人。
| 负责谈大事（如签条约、定国界），权力极大。

Plenipotentiary (全权代表) —— “带着空白支票的人” +
这个词源自拉丁语，pleni（满的）+ potent（权力）。在 19 世纪的远东史中，你经常会看到这个词（比如签订《南京条约》时）。

职能： #*他不仅仅是去传话的。政府给了他一项特殊的特权：在不需要反复请示国内的情况下，现场拍板做决定。 只要他在条约上签字，就等同于他背后的国家承认了。*#

通俗比喻： 他就像是**“钦差大臣”。皇帝给了他一把“尚方宝剑”，还给了他一张已经盖好章的空白支票**。他说怎么签，就怎么签。
|===

具体的例子：鸦片战争时期的角色 +
为了让你看清这三者的互动，我们假设一个场景：

- Consul (领事)： 驻广州的英国领事发现英国商人的鸦片被没收了，他跑去跟两广总督吵架，要求还钱。他管的是具体的纠纷。
- Ambassador (大使)： 英国政府觉得领事搞不定，想派一个大使去北京见皇上，谈谈两国长期共处的大计。他代表的是国家的面子。
- Plenipotentiary (全权代表)： 仗打完了，英国政府派来一个 Plenipotentiary（比如亨利·璞鼎查）。他带着军队来，直接跟清朝代表说：“这五条要求，你们必须签，我也准备好签了。” 他负责的是决定命运的谈判。

在 19 世纪，由于没有电报，从伦敦到香港来回要几个月，所以派往远东的高级官员, 通常都被赋予了 Plenipotentiary 的头衔，否则凡事都要写信回伦敦请示，仗都打完了信还没寄到。

当谓语动词由助动词（如 had, have, is, will）和主要动词（如 been, done, gone）组成时，频度副词或时间副词, 通常习惯于**“插在中间”**。


为什么不写成 earlier had been？
虽然 earlier had been 在语法上并不算绝对错误，但它听起来非常别扭且不自然。

*在英语中，当句子包含助动词（如 had, have, will等）和实义动词（如 been, done, gone等）时，副词通常不放在助动词之前，而是插在助动词与实义动词之间。*

- He *has always been*​ a reliable friend. 他 一直​ 是个可靠的朋友。 +
- She *will never forget*​ that day. 她 永远不会​ 忘记那一天。 +
- The project *has recently been​ completed*. 这个项目 最近​ 已经完成了。 +

Hong Kong was intricately linked to this second war between Britain and China.  +
Governor Bowring, who was also British plenipotentiary and superintendent of trade in China, requested an official meeting with Governor-General Ye Mingchen in Canton, but the two could not agree on a suitable meeting place.  +
Bowring had come to Hong Kong in 1854 convinced that another conflict with China was on the horizon.  +
With his interest in Chinese culture, Bowring was determined to patch up Anglo-Chinese relations even though his predecessors had failed.  +
But Bowring’s four years in Canton as British consul left him convinced that Britain needed a more vigorous policy toward China and that only through force could China be brought to its senses.  +
A Unitarian and a friend and admirer of liberal philosophers Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, Bowring was an ardent believer in free trade.  +
Convinced that no nation could resist this “great tide of tendency” that would eventually change the world, he once said that “Jesus Christ is Free Trade and Free Trade is Jesus Christ.”21 Bowring had earlier been president of the Peace Society, which advocated the abolition of war and the peaceful resolution of international disputes through conciliation (in 1855 he became the first Westerner to make a treaty with Siam), and he wanted more humane policies for the Chinese in Hong Kong (in 1846, as a member of Parliament, he had condemned the routine use of flogging in Hong Kong for minor offenses).  +
Nonetheless, he helped cause another war between China and Britain.
香港与第二次中英战争有着千丝万缕的联系。时任香港总督兼英国驻华全权代表和贸易总监的鲍林曾请求与广州总督叶明臣举行正式会晤，但双方未能就合适的会晤地点达成一致。鲍林于 1854 年来到香港，深信与中国的另一场冲突即将爆发。他对中国文化颇感兴趣，决心修复英中关系，尽管他的前任们都未能成功。然而，在广州担任英国领事的四年经历让他确信，英国需要对华采取更为强硬的政策，只有通过武力才能使中国清醒过来。鲍林是一位一神论者，也是自由主义哲学家杰里米·边沁和约翰·斯图亚特·密尔的朋友和仰慕者，他坚定地拥护自由贸易。他坚信没有任何国家能够抵挡这股最终将改变世界的“大潮流”，他曾说过：“耶稣基督就是自由贸易，自由贸易就是耶稣基督。” 鲍林早年曾任和平协会会长，该协会倡导废除战争，并通过调解和平解决国际争端（1855 年，他成为首位与暹罗缔结条约的西方人）。他还希望香港华人能享受更人道的待遇（1846 年，作为国会议员，他曾谴责香港对轻微罪行普遍使用鞭刑）。然而，他却促成了中英之间的另一场战争。 +

|主动|被动


|▶ 过去完成时 – had done

*过去完成时，该时态表示的是，##某个行为动作, 在过去某个时间点之前已经结束/完成。它讲的是"过去的过去"，强调的是与“过去”的关系。##是处在“过去”的某个时间，对此之前发生的一个或多个动作陈述。#必须要有"过去的时间或动作"来比较。*#

- The plane *#had already taken of#* /when she *arrived* at the airport. +
她到达机场的时候，这家飞机已经起飞了。 +
从时间轴我们可以看到，在“she arrived”之前，这架飞机已经“took off”，也就是说，飞机起飞这个事情发生在她到达之前，飞机起飞发生在"过去的过去"。

|▶ Had been done 过去完成时+被动语态

"Had been done" is the _past perfect passive_ voice, used to describe an action that was completed before _a specific point_ or _another action_ in the past. It emphasizes that /the action was finalized 完成，敲定，最终确定, often focusing on the result or the object receiving 遭受，经受（特定待遇）；对……作出反应 the action rather than the doer 行为者.

Had been done 过去完成时被动语态，*用于描述##在过去某个特定时间点之前 完成的动作##或另一个动作。 它强调行动已经完成，##通常关注"结果"或"行动的接受者"，##而不是"行动者"。*

"过去完成时"的被动语态表示，某件事情或动作, 在过去的某个时间点之前已经完成。常与 by，before等引导的时间状语连用。

- The classroom *had been cleaned* before the teacher *came*. +
老师来之前，课时已经（被）打扫过了。

**从时间轴我们看到，这场雪在过去的某个时间点开始, 并持续下了三天“was snowing for three days”，但是雪在我们到达这个地方“we arrived”之前已经停了。**下雪开始于过去, 也停雪于过去。

两个时间点past1和past2都在过去。下雪是在过去某个时间段里持续发生的事情，但没有持续到现在。而我们站在过去（在这个句子中是“we arrived(here)”）这个时间点对“it was snowing for three days”这个事情陈述，就可以说是“it had been snowing for three days.”。

.Both Canton authorities and the boat’s crew later *denied that* the flag had been flying *at all* when the Chinese police boarded.


- 这里的 "at all" 是关键，它通常用于否定句或疑问句中表示“压根、根本”。 (denied ... at all)
- Flying：在这里指旗帜“悬挂着”或“飘扬着”。
- Had been flying：使用过去完成时, 是因为这个动作发生在“登船（boarded）”这个过去动作之前。表示在警察登船那个时间点之前，旗帜一直处于飘扬状态。

中方官员和船员表达的意思是：“我们不承认‘旗子当时在飘’这种说法。” +
所以，中方官员是在说：“我们上船的时候，那根杆子上光秃秃的，根本（at all）没见什么英国旗，更别提把它扯下来了！”

.Harry Parkes, British consul at Canton, demanded that /Chinese authorities *both* release the crew *and* apologize for defacing the British flag.  +

"demand"（要求）属于表示命令、建议、要求的动词，其后的宾语从句, 通常使用虚拟语气，即 "should + 动词原形"​ 或直接省略 "should"​ 使用动词原形。

Hoping to foster a sense of colonial loyalty, in 1855 Bowring allowed Chinese who leased land in Hong Kong to register their vessels under the British flag, which many did to protect themselves from piracy in the surrounding waters and from rapacious officials in Chinese ports.  +
On October 8, 1856, Chinese police in Canton boarded the Arrow, a Chinese-owned vessel registered in Hong Kong, and arrested a dozen Chinese crewmen suspected of being involved in piracy and smuggling.  +

为了培养殖民地人民的忠诚，鲍林于 1855 年允许在香港租地的中国人将船只注册在英国国旗下。许多人这样做是为了保护自己免受周边海域海盗的袭击以及中国港口贪婪官员的剥削。1856 年 10 月 8 日，广州的中国警察登上了一艘在香港注册的中国人所有的船只 “箭号” ，逮捕了十几名涉嫌参与海盗和走私的中国船员。尽管事件的细节模糊不清，但该船的注册已经过期，其英国船长声称英国国旗是在冲突中被扯下的。（广州当局和船员后来都否认中国警察登船时船上悬挂过英国国旗。）英国驻广州领事哈里·帕克斯要求中国当局释放船员并为玷污英国国旗道歉。中国当局释放了船员，但拒绝道歉，帕克斯于是请求英国皇家海军炮轰叶家在广州的住所。清政府的回应是焚毁了广州的欧洲工厂。 +

Although many British officials did not want another war over such a minor incident, the issue became a matter of national honor.  +

尽管许多英国官员不愿因这样一件小事再次发动战争，但此事最终演变成关乎国家荣誉的问题。当中国拒绝向帕克斯道歉时，鲍林集结军队进攻广州。对鲍林而言，“ 箭矢事件”是解决第一次鸦片战争遗留问题、修改《南京条约》使其更有利于英国的绝佳借口。英国派遣了一支惩罚性远征军，法国也派出远征军，名义上是为了惩罚中国在广西杀害一名天主教传教士。在美军的协助下，英法联军最终于 1857 年 12 月攻占广州，俘虏了总督叶锦（并将其流放到加尔各答），并在帕克斯的领导下建立了临时政府。 +

Stonecutters Island (石匠岛) 昂船洲 是香港维多利亚港内的一个旧岛屿 。 填海造陆后，它现在与九龙半岛相连。

image:/img/Stonecutters Island.jpg[,%]

The island *was ceded* by the Qing dynasty *to* the United Kingdom of _Great Britain and Ireland_ 爱尔兰 *along with* Kowloon in 1860 /through the Convention of Peking. It was initially used for quarrying (v.n.)采石 by the British, hence the English name for the island. In the 1850s it was the site of a prison.[1]

1860 年， 清朝根据 《北京条约》 将该岛连同九龙割让给大不列颠及爱尔兰联合王国 。最初，英国人将该岛用作采石场，因此该岛得名 “Stonecutters Island ”。19 世纪 50 年代，该岛曾是监狱所在地。

Stonecutters Island 这个名字的由来, 是因为英国人最初在那里采石。

A supplementary treaty in October imposed a tariff on the importation of opium, effectively legalizing the opium trade.  +
The war continued, however, with the Anglo-French forces occupying Beijing, burning the Summer Palace, and forcing the Xianfeng emperor into exile.  +
The Convention of Peking, accepted in 1860 by the emperor’s younger brother, Prince Gong, raised the indemnities, reaffirmed the British right to diplomatic residence in Beijing, and ceded to Britain the Kowloon Peninsula along with Stonecutters Island, a small island to the west of Hong Kong Island.
1858年6月，中国、英国、法国、俄国和美国签署了《天津条约》。该条约规定了更高的赔款额度、在北京设立外交机构、开放十个中国港口进行对外贸易，以及西方传教士和商人进入中国腹地的权利。同年10月签署的补充条约对鸦片进口征收关税，实际上使鸦片贸易合法化。然而，战争仍在继续，英法联军占领北京，焚毁颐和园，迫使咸丰皇帝流亡。1860年，咸丰皇帝的弟弟恭亲王接受了《北京条约》。该条约提高了赔款额度，重申了英国在北京设立外交机构的权利，并将九龙半岛以及香港岛西侧的小岛昂船洲割让给英国。 +

across the harbor：字面意思是“横跨港湾”，即“在港湾的对岸”。 +
from Hong Kong Island：表示“从香港岛出发”或“相对于香港岛而言”。 +

这个 harbor, 就是香港岛与九龙半岛之间隔着维多利亚港（Victoria Harbour）。

#*这里的 harbor（港湾）指的是维多利亚港（Victoria Harbour），它既不属于香港岛，也不属于九龙地区，而是位于两者之间，是分隔香港岛和九龙半岛的天然水域。它本身是一片水域，不属于任何一方的陆地。*#

“Across”的含义：短语 across the harbor from Hong Kong Island 描述的是从香港岛出发，越过港湾，到达对岸。因此，这个短语所指的目的地（即九龙城）位于九龙地区。

- Harbor（港湾/海港）：指天然的或人工的水域，用于船只停泊和避风。它是一个地理概念。 +

鲍林因挑起与中国的另一场战争而受到英国国内的广泛批评，但他却得到了当时已是首相的帕默斯顿勋爵的大力支持。香港的欧洲人更是给予鲍林极大的鼓励。1854年他抵达香港时，欧洲社群已处于焦虑不安的状态。对香港现状普遍感到失望之情弥漫在空气中。19世纪40年代末，中欧之间的紧张关系尤为突出，特别是1847年，在香港外国人遭到袭击后，总督戴维斯派遣惩罚性远征军炮击广州。1848年7月，一些香港华人试图毒害皇家炮兵部队成员。同年12月，一名纵火犯试图焚毁中央市场。1849年2月，一群中国海盗杀害了两名英国军官，原因是这两名军官对一名村姑进行了性骚扰。 1849年8月，澳门葡萄牙总督遇刺后，香港传出谣言，称广东当局悬赏捉拿澳门总督乔治·邦汉。尽管太平天国运动最终促成了香港的转型，但它也时常威胁到香港。1854年秋，太平天国军队与清军争夺九龙城的控制权，九龙城与香港岛隔海相望。太平军不时进驻香港街头，他们的一些领导人与伦敦传教会的詹姆斯·莱格等英国传教士关系密切。 +

[.my1]
.案例

.这里为什么用了 had been 而不是 was?
这里使用 "had been"（过去完成时）而不是简单的 "was"（一般过去时），主要是为了在时间线上建立**“过去之中的过去”这种层次感，并强调事件的持续影响, 或定性**。

*had been (过去完成时)：像是在拍一部电影，导演先带你站在1860年代的香港，然后回过头去看更早发生的巴拉克拉瓦战役（1854年）。*

通过使用 had been，作者在暗示：当 1860 年代的英国人感到焦虑时，这场已经发生的、惨烈的战役（1854年）已经成了他们记忆中一个既定的、沉重的伤疤。 +

为什么 Balaklava 如此 Tragic？ +
文中所指的这场战役中，发生了著名的“轻骑兵冲锋” (Charge of the Light Brigade)。由于指挥官传达命令失误，英国精锐轻骑兵直接冲向了俄军密集的炮火阵地。 +

- 结果：短短几十分钟，六百多人冲锋，死伤过半，几乎全军覆没。 +
- 意义：这件事在当时被视为英军指挥极度无能的象征。这也是为什么作者要用 had been，因为在随后的十年里，这种“无能导致的惨剧”一直是英国精英阶层挥之不去的心病。

香港欧洲社群的这些担忧和恐惧反映了 19 世纪 50 年代中期至 60 年代中期大英帝国所处的危机和焦虑时期。从 1853 年末到 1856 年初，英国、法国和奥斯曼土耳其与俄罗斯在黑海的克里米亚半岛交战。尽管英国及其盟国最终取得了胜利，但双方的作战都极其糟糕，这场战争共造成约 50 万人丧生。对英国而言，1854 年 10 月的巴拉克拉瓦战役尤其惨痛。这场战役被英国诗人阿尔弗雷德·丁尼生勋爵写进了诗作《轻骑兵的冲锋》中，成为一段传奇。战役中，轻骑兵几乎损失了一半的兵力。克里米亚战争重新引发了人们对保卫英属印度的担忧，随后是 1856 年至 1857 年的波斯战争。在东南亚，1854 年新加坡华人暴动之后，槟城华人从 1857 年至 1867 年每年都发生暴动。1857 年，沙捞越也爆发了类似的华人暴动，1859 年至 1860 年，当地伊班族人发动了起义。1857 年，南非科萨族人发起了一场大规模的千禧年抗议活动，旨在将白人驱逐出该地区。许多英国政客和军方官员都对美国日益增长的实力感到担忧。 （尽管没有必要，香港殖民地财政大臣还是担心美国内战期间美国军舰的威胁，并要求增派驻军以保护殖民地。）一位历史学家认为，英国未能打开中国和拉丁美洲市场，甚至加剧了 1865 年牙买加莫兰特湾起义的残酷镇压，这一事件证实了英国种植园主对黑人起义由来已久的恐惧 。22 +

No event during this decade would shake the British Empire more than the Indian Rebellion (or the Great Mutiny as it was known to Britons).  +
Although the rebellion was eventually suppressed with help from loyal Indian troops, it rattled the very foundations of British imperialism.  +
Newspapers throughout the empire had a field day with a rebel massacre in July 1857 at Cawnpore (also written as Kanpur), with reports of sexually violated white women and English babies thrown by the rebels onto bayonets.  +
The British punished the rebels in Cawnpore by making them clean up the blood of the murdered Europeans (with their tongues, if they refused) before hanging them.  +

在这十年间，没有哪件事比印度起义（英国人称之为“大兵变”）更能撼动大英帝国。尽管在忠诚的印度军队的帮助下，起义最终被镇压，但它动摇了英国帝国主义的根基。1857年7月，坎普尔（也作坎普尔）发生了一起起义者屠杀事件，整个帝国的报纸都对此大肆报道，称起义者性侵了白人妇女，并将英国婴儿扔到刺刀上。英国人惩罚坎普尔的起义者，让他们用舌头舔干净被杀害的欧洲人的血迹（如果他们拒绝），然后绞死他们。起义领袖被绑在大炮前炸死，这种做法是英国人从印度莫卧儿王朝统治者那里继承来的。 +

|Satan had rebelled 撒旦造反
|在基督教传统中，撒旦原是上帝身边最美丽、最有权力的天使（路西法），但他因为傲慢而背叛了上帝，最终坠入地狱。

英国人一直把自己比作“文明的传播者”和“上帝的代理人”，而把印度人看作是受他们保护和恩惠的臣民。英国人看来，印度人的反抗不是“起义”，而是背叛。

|_The mark of a black skin_ was the mark of Cain 黑皮肤是该隐的烙印
|The Mark of Cain：在《圣经·创世纪》中，亚当的长子该隐, 因为嫉妒 杀死了弟弟亚伯。上帝在改隐额头上落下一个“烙印”，作为他杀亲罪行的标记，让他永远流浪。

这里将“黑色的皮肤”直接等同于圣经里罪犯该隐的“烙印”。 +

它传达了一种偏见——只要你皮肤是黑色的（指印度人），你生来就是卑鄙、残忍、注定会背叛的罪人。 +
这是一种**“贴标签”**的行为。英国人通过这个比喻告诉自己：“别再天真了，他们的肤色就是他们邪恶本质的证明，他们生来就是杀人犯。”

While there had been much enthusiasm in Britain for the Crimean War, the reaction toward the Indian uprising was one of shock and terror.  +
Some Britons denounced the barbaric execution of the rebels, but the rebellion seemed to disprove the naive yet widely held notion that British rule would keep imperial subjects content and obedient.  +
“To the British,” writes historian Ronald Hyam, “it seemed that Satan had rebelled and the mark of a black skin was the mark of Cain....  +
There had been one universal belief that no danger could ever approach the British in India, and that God was on the side of the empire and that everybody loved the British.”23 That Indian civilians had also been involved made things even worse.  +
A mutiny had expanded into a general rebellion, convincing many Britons that the Indians were no longer harmless and docile heathens but rather were treacherous and sinister savages.  +
Formerly loyal Indian friends and servants had suddenly—and seemingly inexplicably—become spies and murderers.
尽管英国对克里米亚战争热情高涨，但对印度起义的反应却是震惊和恐惧。一些英国人谴责对叛乱者的野蛮处决，但这场起义似乎推翻了英国统治能够使帝国臣民保持安宁顺从这一天真却又广为流传的观念。历史学家罗纳德·海厄姆写道：“对英国人来说，这仿佛是撒旦的叛乱，黑皮肤的印记就是该隐的印记……此前，人们普遍认为英国在印度永远不会面临任何危险，上帝站在帝国一边，人人都爱戴英国人。” 23 印度平民的参与更是雪上加霜。一场小规模兵变演变成一场全面叛乱，使许多英国人确信，印度人不再是温顺无害的异教徒，而是阴险狡诈的野蛮人。以前忠诚的印度朋友和仆人突然——而且似乎毫无缘由地——变成了间谍和杀人犯。 +

在这种氛围下，许多在港的欧洲人将1857年1月15日的面包中毒事件视为叶家明号召香港华人反抗英国殖民者的直接回应。当天早上，包括总督夫人鲍林夫人在内的数百名欧洲人食用了义胜面包店烘焙的面包后，立即出现剧烈呕吐。很快，毒物被确定为砒霜。由于砒霜含量极高，大多数欧洲人在消化掉大部分毒素之前就已呕吐。但由于义胜面包店是当时香港仅存的西式面包店，欧洲人认为这起事件是企图消灭他们整个社群的阴谋。他们的担忧似乎得到了证实，因为面包店老板张亚霖（一位买办）当天早上就带着家人前往澳门，而此时欧洲人正准备享用早餐。张亚霖被捕后押回香港受审，他声称自己和家人也是因为吃了同样的面包而中毒。 +

*Small wonder* 难怪；不足为奇, then, that the Times 泰晤士报 complained 抱怨；投诉 in March 1859 how “Hongkong *is always connected with*  some fatal pestilence 瘟疫；疫病, some doubtful 可疑的；不确定的 war, or some _discreditable 不光彩的；丢脸的 internal 内部的 squabble_ 争吵；口角, *so much 如此多 so that* 如此之甚以至于,以至于；因而, in popular language, `主` #the name# of _this noisy 喧闹的, bustling 繁忙的；熙熙攘攘的, quarrelsome (a.)好争吵的；爱吵架的, disconnected 分裂的；不连贯的 little Island_ `系` #may _not inaptly_ (笨拙地；不适当地；不合宜地) 即恰当地；适宜地 be used as# _a euphemistic 委婉的；婉转的 synonym_ 同义词 for a place `后定说明` not mentionable 值得提及的 to _ears polite_ 有教养的耳朵；体面人.”

难怪，《泰晤士报》在1859年3月曾抱怨说：“香港总是与某些致命的瘟疫、某场令人疑虑的战争，或某些不光彩的内部争吵联系在一起，以至于在流行语中，这个喧闹、繁忙、好争吵、脱节的小岛的名字，可以被不恰当地用作一个不宜在雅言中提及的地方的委婉同义词。”

|Small wonder, then
|难怪/不足为奇。表示基于前面提到的投毒、内斗等乱象，得出下面的结论是理所当然的。

|Fatal pestilence | 致命的瘟疫。指当时香港卫生极差，疟疾、瘟疫横行。
| Doubtful war | 前途未卜/名不正言不顺的战争。指第二次鸦片战争，当时英国国内也有很多反对声音。
| Discreditable internal squabble | 丢脸的内部内讧。指文中所说的报社编辑、官员之间互相起诉的丑闻。

|so much so that
|以至于到了这种地步。 +
so much so that，用于引导一个表示程度或结果的从句，意为“到这样的程度以至于…”。

|the name of this noisy, bustling, quarrelsome, disconnected little Island
|四个并列的形容词，描绘香港的负面形象。 +
disconnected此处不指物理断开，而指“与社会主流脱节的、孤立的”。

|may not inaptly be used as
|not inaptly **是双重否定，字面是“并非不恰当地”，实际是委婉的肯定，意为“可以被非常贴切地使用。”，**保留了原文略带讽刺的语气。

|a euphemous synonym
|意思是: "一个委婉的同义词". +
euphemous 是 euphemistic 的错拼或变体，意为“委婉的”。

|for a place not mentionable to ears polite.
|在斯文人耳中不便提及的地方。 +
##**ears polite是古雅表达，相当于 polite ears（高雅的、有教养的耳朵），指“在体面场合/雅言中”。**## +
整部分意为“一个不适宜在体面场合提及的地方（的委婉说法）”，暗指地狱或类似的不详之地。

ears polite： 这是一个Transferred Epithet（移位修饰）​ 或Hypallage的修辞格。##**形容词polite本应修饰“人”或“言语”，但被转移来修饰“耳朵”，意指“在体面人听来”或“在高雅的言谈中”。**##翻译为“不宜在雅言中提及”妥善处理了这个修辞，将其意译出来。 +
*place not mentionable... 则是用含蓄的说法暗指不祥之地，如地狱。*

在 19 世纪，上流社会（斯文人/Ears polite）是非常避讳说某些词的，最典型的就是 "Hell"（地狱）。

逻辑链条：
香港充满了瘟疫、战争和内斗。
香港简直就像地狱。
但斯文人不能直接说“地狱”这个词。
所以，大家干脆用“香港”来代替“地狱”。

翻译成现代白话：
“难怪《泰晤士报》在 1859 年 3 月抱怨说，香港总是和致命瘟疫、不明不道的战争或者是丢人的内讧扯在一起。搞得大家现在私下里都觉得，‘香港’这个吵闹、喧嚣、充满了争吵和混乱的小岛名字，简直可以被当作‘地狱’的委婉代称了。”

这段话体现了当时英国主流舆论对香港的极端厌恶。在他们眼里，这个新拿下的殖民地不仅没带来多少财富，反而成了麻烦、丑闻和死亡的聚集地。

Insufficient evidence exists of how this incident played out among the Chinese community of Hong Kong.  +
But all sorts of conflicting theories and questions arose among the European community.  +
Although a local English newspaper later suggested that the flour in the bread might have been contaminated on board a ship carrying arsenopyrite, there was good reason to believe that the poisoning had been deliberate, for some Chinese servants had warned their European employers about the plan.  +
Regardless, the case had revealed the tensions and suspicions in Hong Kong not just between the Chinese and Europeans but within the European community as well.  +
William Tarrant, a newspaper editor and former colonial official whose frequent attacks on the colonial government led to libel, fines, and even his imprisonment, sued Cheong for damages.  +
Although Tarrant was successful, Cheong left town again without paying up.  +
When Tarrant then accused the acting colonial secretary of letting Cheong escape, the acting colonial secretary in turn sued Tarrant for libel.  +
Tarrant lost, but his sympathizers came up with the compensation.  +
Small wonder, then, that the Times complained in March 1859 how “Hongkong is always connected with some fatal pestilence, some doubtful war, or some discreditable internal squabble, so much so that, in popular language, the name of this noisy, bustling, quarrelsome, disconnected little Island may not inaptly be used as a euphemous synonym for a place not mentionable to ears polite.”
关于这起事件在香港华人社区内部的后续发展，目前尚无充分证据。但在欧洲人社区中，各种相互矛盾的理论和疑问层出不穷。尽管一家当地英文报纸后来提出，面包中的面粉可能是在一艘载有毒砂的船上被污染的，但人们有充分的理由相信投毒是蓄意的，因为一些中国佣人曾警告过他们的欧洲雇主这一计划。无论如何，这起事件揭示了香港的紧张局势和猜忌，不仅存在于华人与欧洲人之间，也存在于欧洲人社区内部。威廉·塔兰特是一位报纸编辑，也是一位前殖民地官员，他经常抨击殖民地政府，因此遭到诽谤、罚款甚至监禁。他起诉张某，要求赔偿损失。尽管塔兰特胜诉，但张某再次逃亡，并未支付赔偿金。之后，塔兰特指责代理殖民地大臣放走了张某，代理殖民地大臣反过来起诉塔兰特诽谤。塔兰特败诉，但他的支持者筹集了赔偿金。因此，难怪《泰晤士报》在 1859 年 3 月抱怨说：“香港总是与某种致命的瘟疫、某种来历不明的战争或某种不光彩的内部纷争联系在一起，以至于在通俗语言中，这个喧闹、熙攘、争吵不断、与世隔绝的小岛的名字，或许可以不恰当地用作一个不雅之物的委婉说法。” 24 +

.Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee

**Diamond Jubilee **在英语中是一个专有名词，*特指君主登基60周年的盛大庆典。* +
在文中，它指的是维多利亚女王（Queen Victoria）登基60周年的钻禧大庆。


英国皇室对君主在位周年的称呼有一套类似“结婚周年”的金属/宝石体系：

| Golden Jubilee  金禧 | 50周年

| Platinum Jubilee  金刚石/白金禧 | 70周年
|===

文中提到：香港针对华人的“宵禁令”直到 1897 年才为了庆祝 Diamond Jubilee 而取消。这背后有几个层面的含义：

- 大赦与恩赐：1897 年是维多利亚女王登基 60 周年。当时大英帝国正处于鼎盛时期，为了彰显女王的“仁慈”和“天下大同”的帝国胸怀，港英政府决定送出一份“大礼”给香港华人。不过, 文中最后提到 "the governor retained the right to reinstate the curfew"（总督保留了恢复宵禁的权利）。这说明这种“善意”的实际权力依然攥在香港总督手里。
- 政治台阶：当时华人和欧亚混血领袖已经抗议了两年。政府正好借着“钻禧大庆”这个喜庆的借口，顺水推舟取消了带有种族歧视色彩的宵禁，既给了华人面子，又维持了政府的威严（显得是恩赐，而不是被迫让步）。

漫长的压迫：从 1850 年代第二次鸦片战争开始，到 1897 年才取消，这意味着香港华人在自己家门口被限制“夜晚出门”长达 40年 之久。

这场“充满争议的战争”最终实现了英国的愿望：在北京获得外交承认，开放十个中国港口进行国际贸易，以及鸦片合法化。战争也对香港产生了诸多重要影响。殖民政府颁布了一系列紧急措施，实际上将香港的华人居民置于戒严状态，包括宵禁、驱逐出境以及悬赏缉拿告密者。政府还赋予了欧洲人一些自卫权，例如设置路障、夜间锁住华人佣人，以及允许夜间哨兵或巡逻人员对任何形迹可疑的华人开枪。尽管许多措施后来被废除，但有些措施在战后仍然有效。例如，华人宵禁直到1897年才被取消，此前一些华裔和欧亚裔领袖在1895年提出抗议，作为维多利亚女王登基六十周年庆典的友好姿态。即便如此，总督仍然保留着恢复宵禁的权力。 +

|为什么不能写为 was
|- 句子开头有 #*appears​ (似乎，看来)，表达的是一种推测, 因此，不能用一个表示确定事实的 was来搭配一个表示推测的 appears。*#
- appears to be 是现在推测，但事件是过去的，所以需要将 be 变成完成体 have been，构成 appears to have been。

|为什么不能写为  had been
|#*had been(过去完成时)表示“过去的过去”， 它需要挂钩到一个"过去的时间点"来作为参照点.*# 即在一个过去的参照时间点之前, 已经完成或存在的状态。

如果写成 The exodus... had been a response... 意思就会是: “到（某个过去时间点）为止，那次离去, 早已是一种反应了”。 +
但本段中, 这个句子是直接叙述1858年7月的事件，没有提供另一个更晚(更后面发生)的过去时间点(比如1860年),来作为“那次离去是其反应”的参照。#*had been会让人疑惑：“是在哪个过去时间点之前？” 这里缺乏那个必要的参照点。*#

Although they must have reinforced the Chinese community’s resentment of colonial rule, the effects of the Second Opium War and the emergency measures taken during the war on Hong Kong’s Chinese community are somewhat harder to characterize.  +
Partly in response to Governor-General Ye’s order to leave the colony, in early 1857 some five thousand Chinese left Hong Kong.  +
After Anglo-French forces occupied Canton in December 1857, many Chinese left Hong Kong from January 1858 through October 1861.  +
In July 1858 alone, some twenty thousand artisans, builders, laborers, and tailors left Hong Kong.  +
As historian Jung-fang Tsai has argued, however, antiforeignism “did not necessarily entail Chinese national consciousness.”25 Any attempts to attribute these mass departures to a sense of Chinese patriotism or loyalty to the Qing government are also complicated by the fact that the departures were not always voluntary.  +
For example, the exodus in July 1858 appears to have been partly a response to threats by magistrates in nearby Chinese villages who declared that if the Chinese in Hong Kong did not leave, their relatives in China would be punished as rebels.  +
Even in China, Ye’s prohibitions against food being exported to Hong Kong were rarely obeyed.  +
And the British encountered no significant resistance when they took over Kowloon Peninsula in January 1861.
尽管第二次鸦片战争及其期间采取的紧急措施无疑加剧了香港华人对殖民统治的不满，但这些措施对香港华人社区的影响却难以概括。部分原因是响应总督叶骊清下令离开殖民地，1857 年初，约有五千名华人离开香港。1857 年 12 月英法联军占领广州后，从 1858 年 1 月到 1861 年 10 月，又有许多华人离开香港。仅在 1858 年 7 月，就有约两万名工匠、建筑工人、劳工和裁缝离开香港。然而，正如历史学家蔡荣芳所论证的那样，排外情绪“并不一定意味着中国民族意识”。 25 此外，由于这些离开并非总是出于自愿，因此试图将这些大规模的离境归因于中国爱国主义或对清政府的忠诚也变得复杂起来。例如，1858 年 7 月的大规模迁徙似乎部分是由于附近中国村庄的官员威胁所致。这些官员宣称，如果香港的华人不离开，他们在中国的亲属将被当作叛乱分子惩罚。即使在中国，叶氏禁止向香港出口食品的禁令也鲜有人遵守。1861 年 1 月，英国占领九龙半岛时，也未遇到任何重大抵抗。 +
