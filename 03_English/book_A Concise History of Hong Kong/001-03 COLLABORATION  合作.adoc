[.my2]
使英国在《南京条约》中占上风的军事胜利，不仅得益于英国的军事优势，还得益于中国的通敌者。

The military victory that gave the British the upper hand in the Treaty of Nanking was made possible not just by British military superiority but also by Chinese collaborators.  +
The British received help from the Chinese before and during the First Opium War and in the building of their new colony.  +
Even though authorities in Canton ordered the Chinese in Hong Kong to resist the “barbarians,” the British encountered practically no resistance when they first occupied Hong Kong Island.  +
A British military surgeon wrote that the inhabitants of Hong Kong “appear to be industrious and obliging....  +
From all accounts they seem in general to have been very peaceably disposed; nor did they exhibit any marked approbation or disapprobation, on their transfer to the British sway.”12 In the early 1900s, Chow Shouson, a wealthy businessman and the first Chinese member of the colonial Executive Council, used to boast how his ancestors, who had lived on the island before the British arrived, had helped the British post Elliot’s proclamation that Hong Kong would be a free port.
英国在《南京条约》中取得的军事胜利，不仅得益于英国的军事优势，也离不开中国合作者的帮助。在第一次鸦片战争前后以及建立新殖民地的过程中，英国都得到了中国人的援助。尽管广州当局命令香港的中国人抵抗“蛮夷”，但英国人最初占领香港岛时几乎没有遇到任何抵抗。一位英国军医写道，香港居民“看起来勤劳且乐于助人……据各方记载，他们普遍性情温和；对于被置于英国统治之下，他们既没有表现出明显的赞同，也没有表现出明显的反对。” 12 20 世纪初，富商周寿生是殖民地行政委员会的首位华人议员，他常常吹嘘自己的祖先在英国人到来之前就居住在香港，并在埃利奥特宣布香港成为自由港后为英国提供了帮助。 +

没有单一的原因能够充分解释为何一些中国人如此热衷于帮助英国人。在第一次鸦片战争期间，英国人也并非在所有地方都能找到中国合作者。例如，战争初期，英国人获取补给十分困难，尤其是在他们短暂且失败地占领舟山（外国人称之为舟山）期间。舟山是位于中国沿海上海附近的一个小岛，当地中国人拒绝合作。一些合作者以对满清的怨恨为由，为自己的行为辩解。另一些人则来自长期以来与欧洲人在华南沿海海域合作的少数民族。然而，对于大多数合作者而言，与英国人合作主要还是出于财富和权力的考量。 +

.案例

One colorful collaborator was Loo Aqui, who rose to prominence through piracy and provisioning foreign vessels.  +
Loo was a Tanka, one of the minority ethnic groups that lived along the southern China coast.  +
Ostracized by other Chinese, these so-called egg families lived in communities of small boats, making their livelihood from fishing, shipping, and provisioning.  +
Like many other fishing communities, they often resorted to piracy, especially when economic conditions were rough.  +
From the earliest days of the foreign presence in Canton, ‘Iankas had traded with foreign merchants and served as middlemen, even though the Qing government prohibited this on pain of death.  +
During the war, some Tankas provided British naval and merchant vessels with supplies.  +
Loo was later rewarded for provisioning the British forces with a large plot of valuable land in the Lower Bazaar, where much of the Chinese population of Hong Kong would eventually settle.  +
He soon became one of the colony’s wealthiest and most powerful Chinese residents.
其中一位颇具传奇色彩的合作者是卢阿奎，他靠海盗活动和为外国船只提供补给而声名鹊起。卢阿奎是羌族人，羌族是居住在中国南方沿海的少数民族之一。这些被称为“蛋形家庭”的羌族人被其他华人排斥，他们居住在由小船组成的社区里，以捕鱼、航运和补给为生。像许多其他渔民一样，他们经常从事海盗活动，尤其是在经济困难时期。早在清政府明令禁止外族人进入广州之前，羌族人就与外国商人进行贸易，并充当中间人。战争期间，一些羌族人为英国海军和商船提供补给。卢阿奎后来因向英军提供补给而获得下巴刹的一大片肥沃土地，香港的许多华人最终都定居于此。他很快成为香港殖民地最富有、最有权势的华人居民之一。 +

Kwok Acheong was another Tanka boatman 船夫 who supplied (v.) provisions 饮食供应；（尤指旅途中的）粮食;补给品；食物和必需品 to the British forces during the First Opium War.  +

He joined _the Peninsular 半岛的 and Oriental 东方人的；东方的 (P&O) Steam 蒸汽 Navigation 航行，航海；航运 Company_ in 1845 and soon became its comprador 买办（旧时中外贸易中,替西方商人管理业务的华人代理人）.  +

.pidgin English
洋泾浜英语（英语：Chinese Pidgin English），是皮钦语的一种。因Pidgin发音与Pigeon（白鸽）相同，所以被不谙英语者误译为白鸽英语（Pigeon English。

洋泾浜英语是19世纪中外商人使用的混杂语言，**只有口头形式，没有统一的书面形式，变体很多。它是英语与上海话结合的产物，**并且在一定程度上受宁波话与粤语的影响。**其语法不符合英语习惯，**语音受汉语影响。*该语言流行于当时的上海洋泾浜周边地区，故由此得名。* 洋泾浜是上海的一条小河流，与黄浦江相连.

洋泾浜英语是各种“中式英语”中较为知名的一个，它只是各种“中式英语”中的一种。

After the British takeover of Hong Kong, Kwok settled in the colony.  +
He joined the Peninsular and Oriental (P&O) Steam Navigation Company in 1845 and soon became its comprador.  +
(Named after the Portuguese word for “buyer,” the comprador system originated in the late Ming dynasty but came to prominence after the Canton System was abolished in 1842 and compradors replaced the hong merchants as the main intermediaries between Chinese and Western traders.) In the 1860s Kwok started a fleet of steamships that competed with the European-owned Hong Kong, Canton and Macao Steamboat Company.  +

郭亚昌是另一位在第一次鸦片战争期间为英军提供补给的爻子船夫。英国接管香港后，郭亚昌定居于此。1845 年，他加入半岛东方轮船公司（P&O），并很快成为该公司的买办。（买办制度源于葡萄牙语“买手”，起源于明末，但在 1842 年广州制度废除后开始盛行，买办取代了商贩，成为中西方贸易的主要中间人。）19 世纪 60 年代，郭亚昌组建了一支轮船队，与欧洲人拥有的港广澳门轮船公司展开竞争。1876 年，他成为香港第三大纳税人。到 1877 年，他已拥有 13 艘轮船，不仅是一位成功的本地华人商人，更是一位区域航运巨头。尽管郭荣铮只会说洋泾浜英语，但他以善于与外国人相处而闻名，并且经常担任殖民政府的顾问。 +

Hong Kong’s physical development was also made possible by Chinese builders, contractors, merchants, and laborers.  +
European colonialism was not only an encounter between different cultures, it was also a process of physical construction that ranged from government, residential, and commercial buildings to entire cities and towns.  +
As in many other Asian colonies, in Hong Kong this construction was completed by Chinese workers and contractors, many of whom had prior experience working for Europeans.  +
Tam Achoy, the most successful of these contractors, was one of the most prominent members of the Chinese community in early colonial Hong Kong.  +
Originally from Kaiping, a county in Guangdong province known for sending emigrants to Southeast Asia and, later, to California, Tam came to Hong Kong in 1841 from the British colony of Singapore, where he had been a foreman in the colonial government dockyards.  +

香港的城市发展也离不开华人建筑工人、承包商、商人和劳工的辛勤付出。欧洲殖民主义不仅是不同文化的碰撞，也是一个大规模的城市建设过程，涵盖了政府、住宅、商业建筑乃至整个城镇。如同许多其他亚洲殖民地一样，香港的建设也主要由华人工人和承包商完成，其中许多人此前就曾为欧洲人工作过。谭阿祖是这些承包商中最成功的一位，也是早期殖民时期香港华人社区的杰出人物。谭阿祖原籍广东省开平县，该县曾向东南亚（后又向加利福尼亚）输送移民。1841 年，谭阿祖从英国殖民地新加坡来到香港，此前他曾在新加坡殖民地政府的船坞担任工头。他建造了殖民地一些最重要的建筑，包括 P&O 大厦以及后来被政府购入用作殖民地第一座最高法院的建筑。谭德塞因在香港和新加坡为英国效力，获封下巴扎的土地。 +

[.my2]
一个复杂的垄断体系，通常通过"公开拍卖"的方式出售专营权，对鸦片、盐、酒和烟草等商品进行管制。

英国人还提供了另一项强有力的合作奖励：利润丰厚的垄断权。历史学家经常强调自由贸易在香港经济发展中的作用。然而，在香港经济发展的早期，它既不繁荣也不自由。一套复杂的垄断体系，通常通过公开拍卖出售，控制着鸦片、食盐、酒类和烟草等商品。具有讽刺意味的是，正是通过这些类型的管制和垄断，英国人曾坚信第一次鸦片战争和“自由贸易帝国主义”能够解放中国。这些垄断权占政府年收入的10%至25%，几乎都由当地的华人商人或承包商持有。其中规模最大、持续时间最长的垄断是鸦片垄断，在19世纪，鸦片垄断的收入几乎占到政府年收入的四分之一。 +

虽然这无法解释这些华人为何在第一次鸦片战争期间帮助英国，但殖民地时期的香港也使卢、郭和谭等人获得了在中国无法企及的社会地位。作为羌家出身的弃儿，卢和郭在中国被禁止担任任何士绅职务。谭在新加坡为英国人工作，违反了清政府禁止海外移民的禁令。然而，在英属香港，这些禁令形同虚设。谭成为三座当地华人庙宇的理事，并是一位知名的慈善家。1847 年，一家英国当地报纸称他“可能是殖民地中同阶层人士中最受人尊敬和最有智慧的人”。1856 年，他协助组建了一支华人消防队，并配备了一台美国制造的消防车。在这种新的殖民地环境下，出身不明的卢也成为了华人社区的杰出成员。人们普遍认为他与三合会和海盗有牵连，并怂恿警察队伍腐败。但他在城里也以乐于助人而闻名，据说他帮助过“那些身处困境、负债累累或心怀不满的人”。 13 +
