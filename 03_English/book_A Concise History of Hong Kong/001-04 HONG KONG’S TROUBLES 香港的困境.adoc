The British occupation made Hong Kong into a boomtown.  +
Hong Kong in the early 1840s had all the rugged excitement of a frontier town, not unlike the gold rush towns in the American West or in Australia and New Zealand.  +
When the British took control of Hong Kong in January 1841, the northern shore of the island was for the most part unoccupied, and the rest of the island consisted mainly of small farming and fishing villages.  +
The island’s total population was probably between five thousand and seven thousand.  +
However, Hong Kong soon drew Chinese of all walks of life from Guangdong and European merchants and missionaries from Macau.  +
By early 1842, Hong Kong was a bustling town with between fifteen thousand and twenty thousand inhabitants, complete with official buildings such as a magistrate’s office, post office, land and record office, and jail.  +
A few rough roads linked these buildings with commercial facilities such as wharves, piers, warehouses, shops, brothels, gambling houses, tailors’ shops, and a marketplace.  +
By 1845, European visitors frequently commented on Hong Kong’s palatial government buildings and opulent merchants’ residences.
英国的占领使香港迅速发展成为一座繁荣的城市。19世纪40年代初的香港充满了边疆小镇的粗犷活力，与美国西部或澳大利亚、新西兰的淘金热时期城镇颇为相似。1841年1月英国接管香港时，岛屿北岸大部分地区无人居住，其余地区则主要由小型农渔村组成。当时全岛总人口可能在五千到七千之间。然而，香港很快吸引了来自广东的各行各业的华人以及来自澳门的欧洲商人和传教士。到1842年初，香港已发展成为一座拥有1.5万到2万居民的繁华城镇，并拥有包括地方官署、邮局、土地登记处和监狱在内的各种官方建筑。几条崎岖的道路将这些建筑与码头、栈桥、仓库、商店、妓院、赌场、裁缝店和市场等商业设施连接起来。到 1845 年，欧洲游客经常对香港富丽堂皇的政府大楼和富丽堂皇的商人住宅赞叹不已。 +

Colonialism 殖民主义 created (v.) tremendous 巨大的；极大的 opportunities 机遇 for wealth, but it also meant (v.) crime, tension 紧张关系；矛盾, and confusion 困惑；混乱.  +

_The new wealth_ in Hong Kong (especially compared with 与……相比较 the poverty 贫困 in the surrounding areas on the mainland), _the easy access_ from China, and _the large number_ of European adventurers 冒险家 all led to crime on land /and piracy 海盗行为 in the surrounding waters.  +

Scholars who celebrate Hong Kong’s political stability and economic success as a capitalist paradise often forget that the colony’s early history was a rocky one.  +
Colonialism created tremendous opportunities for wealth, but it also meant crime, tension, and confusion.  +
The new wealth in Hong Kong (especially compared with the poverty in the surrounding areas on the mainland), the easy access from China, and the large number of European adventurers all led to crime on land and piracy in the surrounding waters.  +
The large and sudden influx of both Chinese and European newcomers meant land shortages and the end of traditional land rights.  +
Some villagers found themselves paying rent not only to the colonial government but also to the Tang family, which had owned most of the land in Hong Kong, or to the Chinese authorities in Guangdong.  +
Unresolved issues about jurisdiction over Hong Kong’s Chinese residents meant that officials in Guangdong often refused to recognize British jurisdiction in Hong Kong, leading to constant tensions between Britain and China that affected relations between the Chinese and European residents of Hog Kong.
那些将香港的政治稳定和经济成功誉为资本主义天堂的学者，往往忽略了这片殖民地早期历史的坎坷。殖民主义创造了巨大的财富机遇，但也带来了犯罪、紧张局势和混乱。香港的新兴财富（尤其与周边大陆地区的贫困相比）、与中国内地便捷的交通以及大量欧洲冒险家的涌入，都导致了陆地犯罪和周边水域的海盗活动。大量中国和欧洲新移民的突然涌入造成了土地短缺和传统土地权的终结。一些村民发现自己不仅要向殖民政府缴纳租金，还要向拥有香港大部分土地的唐氏家族或广东的中国当局缴纳租金。由于对香港中国居民的管辖权问题悬而未决，广东官员常常拒绝承认英国在香港的管辖权，导致英国和中国之间持续的紧张关系，进而影响了香港中国居民和欧洲居民之间的关系。 +

[.my1]
.案例
====
.Little more than
*“略多于”, 意為“僅僅”、“只不過是”或“略多於”*，通常用於強調數量少、程度低或不值一提。它帶有否定意味，暗示與預期相比，實際情況更接近“僅僅”的狀態。

- He is *little 无非、只是、仅仅 more than* a child. (他無非就是個孩子。)
- It cost *a little 略多於、剛超過 more than* $100. (價格略高於100美元。)

[.my2]
1842年7月，《广州周报》哀叹，早期的土地销售 和糟糕的贸易状况, 使得中国买家“一贫如洗，他们的钱都用来建房了，这里为数不多的欧洲居民也是如此；他们都在卖东西，没人买东西。”

尽管香港前景光明，但它并未立即成为其殖民创建者所设想的“东方大都会”。转口贸易发展缓慢，香港最终沦为殖民地前哨和鸦片中心。1842 年 7 月，《广州报》哀叹，早期的土地买卖和糟糕的贸易状况使中国买家“穷得像老鼠一样，他们仅有的几块钱都用来盖房子了，少数居住在此的欧洲人也一样；他们全是卖家，没有买家。” 14 疾病肆虐。1843 年 5 月，近四分之一的英国驻军死于疟疾。海盗猖獗，陆地上的犯罪——尤其是盗窃和入室盗窃——同样猖獗。就连总督府——总督的办公室和官邸——也在 1843 年 4 月 26 日遭到入室盗窃，两天后，两家大型英国公司也相继被盗。 +

在这句话中，“ever”​ 的意思是“在任何时候、从来、永远”，用于加强否定的语气，表示“在任何情况下都永远不会”。

*ever 的加入，将时间维度扩展到“永远、从古至今乃至未来”，极大地强化了这种“绝无可能”的断言语气。它排除了现在、未来任何时间点发生此事的可能性。*

- Nothing will _ever_ change.(什么都永远不会改变。)
- Will he _ever_ come back? (他到底还会不会回来？)

.You may go to Hong Kong for me.
这句话之所以在伦敦的音乐厅（Music Halls）流行，并不是在夸奖香港，而是在“咒人死”或者“叫人滚开”。

当时的香港被称为“白人的坟墓”（The White Man's Grave）。由于疟疾、黄热病、瘟疫（Plague）横行，加上湿热难耐的气候，派往香港的英国士兵和商人,死亡率极高。

想象一下，如果现在有一个地方核辐射超标、充满了致命病毒，环境极差。
当一个人让你不爽时，你对他说：“祝你全家移民到那个核废墟去。”
你不是在祝他移民成功，你是在诅咒他。

In July 1844 Robert Montgomery Martin, the colonial treasurer, reported that the climate, landscape, and trade conditions of Hong Kong were so bad that the British government should abandon the island.  +
The island’s commercial prospects were extremely bleak: “There does not appear to be the slightest probability that, under any circumstances, Hong Kong will ever become a place of trade.” Even the colony’s famously deep harbor was not worth the expense and trouble: “I can see no justification for the British Government spending one shilling on Hong Kong.”15 History would prove Martin wrong, but many contemporary observers shared similar sentiments.  +
The botanist Robert Fortune predicted that “viewed as a place of trade, I fear Hong-kong will be a failure.”16 Alexander Matheson, head of Jardine and Matheson, told the British House of Commons in May 1847 that had they not already invested so much money in land and buildings, most English firms would have already withdrawn from Hong Kong years earlier.  +
After a plague in the fall of 1850 exacerbated already bad health and sanitary conditions, a popular song in London music halls rang “You may go to Hong Kong for me.”
1844 年 7 月，殖民地财政大臣罗伯特·蒙哥马利·马丁报告称，香港的气候、地形和贸易条件极其恶劣，英国政府应该放弃这座岛屿。该岛的商业前景极其黯淡：“无论在任何情况下，香港都不可能成为贸易中心。” 即使是殖民地著名的深水港也不值得投入如此巨大的成本和精力：“我看不出英国政府有任何理由在香港花费一分钱。” 15 历史最终证明马丁的判断是错误的，但许多当时的观察家也持有类似的观点。植物学家罗伯特·福琼预言：“从贸易中心的角度来看，我担心香港将会失败。” 16 怡和洋行总裁亚历山大·马西森于 1847 年 5 月在英国下议院表示，如果不是已经在土地和建筑上投入了如此多的资金，大多数英国公司几年前就已经撤离香港了。 1850 年秋季的一场瘟疫加剧了原本就糟糕的卫生状况，伦敦音乐厅里流行起一首歌曲：“你可以替我去香港。” +

.freighted a ship
freighted：是动词 freight 的过去式。freight的核心意思是 “运输货物”​ 或 “装载货物”。

freight a ship这个动宾结构，其确切含义需要根据主语（发出动作的人）来判断。常见的理解有两种，在本句的语境下第二种更可能：

- 字面/技术操作：为这艘船装上货物。（强调“装货”这个动作本身）
- 商业行为：（作为货主）租用这艘船来运送自己的货物。（强调“租用并利用船只进行运输”的整个商业安排）这是19世纪商人，尤其是鸦片贸易商，的常见做法。

为什么不译为“拥有一艘船”？ +
**Freight这个词本身不包含“拥有”船只产权的意思，它强调的是“使用船只运输”这一功能。**他可能是租用 (charter) 了别人的船，也可能是为自己拥有的船装货，但动词本身不指明产权。从历史语境看，大贸易商通常租用或委托船运公司，而非必然自己拥有船舶。

British officials had hoped that the colony would attract Chinese merchants from Macau and Canton, transforming it into the trading center of southern China, but this did not happen.  +
Part of the problem lay in the Treaty of Nanking, which ceded Hong Kong to Britain but also opened five Chinese ports, thereby diverting trade from Hong Kong.  +
Because trading at the treaty ports was cheaper, British merchants preferred to buy directly from China.  +
Chinese merchants preferred to use British ships for importing and exporting goods to and from Southeast Asia because they were faster, safer, and cheaper than their own junks.  +
Although this benefited British shipping companies, their ships bypassed Hong Kong.  +
Martin lamented how “after three years and a half’s uninterrupted settlement there is not one respectable Chinese inhabitant on the island.” One wealthy opium trader had built a house and freighted a ship in Hong Kong, but he soon returned to Canton, where he died of a fever and cold contracted in the colony.
英国官员曾希望这片殖民地能吸引来自澳门和广州的中国商人，将其打造成为中国南方的贸易中心，但事与愿违。部分原因在于《南京条约》，该条约将香港割让给英国，但也开放了五个中国港口，从而转移了原本流向香港的贸易。由于在这些通商口岸进行贸易成本更低，英国商人更倾向于直接从中国采购。而中国商人则更喜欢使用英国船只往返东南亚进行货物进出口，因为英国船只比他们自己的帆船速度更快、更安全、更便宜。尽管这有利于英国航运公司，但他们的船只却绕过了香港。马丁感叹道：“经过三年半不间断的定居，岛上竟然没有一个像样的华人居民。”一位富有的鸦片商人曾在香港建房并装载货物，但他很快就返回了广州，并在那里因在殖民地感染的疾病和感冒而去世。 17 +

- 驱逐 Vagrants (贫民)： 把穷人塞给香港，是为了增加香港的社会福利负担，让港英政府不仅赚不到钱，还要花钱治理贫民窟和瘟疫。

香港未能吸引大型中国商人的原因之一是，广州的中国当局采取各种限制措施，阻止富有的中国商人前来殖民地。一些殖民地官员确信，广东的中国当局故意将流浪汉、游民和盗贼流放到香港，既是为了清除犯罪分子，也是为了破坏殖民地的稳定。但香港的欧洲居民中也不乏形形色色的不良分子。在英国，香港已成为欧洲不法之徒、逃兵、鲁莽冒险家和投机者的避风港。《 经济学人》 在 1846 年 8 月指出，“香港如今不过是少数鸦片走私犯、士兵、军官和军人的小分队。”美国游客奥斯瓦尔德·蒂芙尼回忆道：“来自伦敦郊区的替罪羊和恶棍，那些侥幸逃过植物湾之劫的家伙，聚集在维多利亚镇，凌驾于当地居民之上。而这些当地居民中，许多人比以往任何时候都更加体面，也更受人尊敬。” 18 +

中国商人不愿来港的主要原因是殖民政府无法提供安全的营商环境。1844年6月，150名海盗洗劫了一处海滨仓库。1845年，总督约翰·戴维斯报告称，由于海盗船封锁了通往港口的东、西两条航道，香港与中国的贸易“几乎瘫痪”。1854年夏季，大规模海盗袭击的威胁使整个香港岛进入紧急警戒状态。同年10月，一群在香港经商的中国船长联名请愿，要求殖民政府派遣轮船镇压海盗，他们声称海盗活动严重损害了他们的生意。同月，一位富有的中国商人雇佣武装船只护送他的船只，将家人和贵重物品运往香港。他的船只在大部分航程中幸存下来，但在进入香港水域时遭到海盗袭击。 1855 年 9 月，总督约翰·鲍林得出结论，困扰殖民地的海盗活动“严重干扰了殖民地的舒适生活和繁荣发展”。 +

如果没有中国政府的帮助，殖民政府无法镇压海盗。然而，殖民政府对香港本地的犯罪活动却束手无策。罗伯特·福琼声称，香港“盗匪横行”。 19 殖民政府也无法向中国商人保证其会继续保有香港。与一些在港的欧洲人一样，许多中国人担心香港会被归还中国。这种担忧并非毫无道理，即使在 1843 年清朝使节启英颁布赦免曾为英军效力的中国人的法令之后，这种担忧依然存在。1844 年 7 月，一名在舟山为英国军需处工作的中国商人被当地官员绑架并斩首。同年 11 月，一张反英标语呼吁所有中国居民离开香港，并希望中国驱逐英国“蛮夷”。虽然齐英在 1845 年 4 月禁止广州和香港的中国人骚扰外国人，但反英标语仍然不断出现。 +
