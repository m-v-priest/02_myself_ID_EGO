War and Revolution  战争与革命
In July 1937, Japan launched a full-scale invasion of China.  +
Despite resistance from Nationalist Chinese troops under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, Japanese troops soon occupied most of China’s major cities.  +
In October 1938, Chiang retreated to Chongqing, in Sichuan province, which became the capital of Free China.  +
Some thirty thousand Japanese troops landed that same month at Daya (Bias) Bay, only thirty miles northeast of Hong Kong, taking the city of Canton within two weeks.  +
Almost overnight, Hong Kong assumed a new importance for China.  +
The colony became a haven for refugees fleeing the Japanese invasion—some five hundred thousand came in 1938 alone—and a crucial source of arms for the Chinese war effort.  +
Until the Japanese took Canton in October 1938, more than fifty tons of munitions and supplies purchased overseas entered China per month via the Kowloon-Canton Railway.  +
Even after the fall of Canton, strategic materials were smuggled into China over land and by boat.  +
Many Chinese newspapers moved to Hong Kong, while local organizations such as the Chinese Merchants’ Relief Association, the Chinese Women’s Relief Association, and the Hong Kong Chinese Women’s Club helped raise money for the war effort.
1937年7月，日本全面入侵中国。尽管蒋介石领导的国民党军队进行了顽强抵抗，日军很快占领了中国的大部分主要城市。1938年10月，蒋介石退守四川重庆，重庆成为自由中国的首都。同月，约三万日军在距离香港东北仅30英里的大亚湾登陆，并在两周内攻占了广州。几乎一夜之间，香港对中国的重要性与日俱增。这片殖民地成为逃离日军入侵的难民的避难所——仅1938年一年就有约50万人涌入——同时也成为中国战争的重要武器来源地。在1938年10月日军攻占广州之前，每月有超过50吨的海外采购的军火和物资经由九广铁路运入中国。即使在广州陷落后，战略物资仍然通过陆路和水路走私进入中国。许多中文报纸迁往香港，而中国商人救济会、中国妇女救济会和香港中国妇女俱乐部等当地组织也帮助筹集资金用于战争。 +
The Sino-Japanese War had a dramatic effect on Hong Kong’s economy.  +
After the Japanese blockaded Shanghai and other Chinese ports, by early 1938 half of China’s foreign trade was diverted through Hong Kong.  +
Banks such as the Bank of China and the Communications Bank moved their headquarters to Hong Kong, making it the exchange banking center for all of China.  +
The massive influx of refugees from China exacerbated the colony’s already crowded housing conditions and strained its resources, but it also created a boom in land sales that boosted government revenues.  +
Chinese entrepreneurs not only brought capital but also transplanted entire factories, some of which produced military equipment for the Chinese war effort.  +
This helped build an industrial base that would greatly assist Hong Kong’s economic recovery after the war.
抗日战争对香港经济产生了巨大影响。日军封锁上海及其他中国港口后，到1938年初，中国一半的对外贸易都不得不经由香港进行。中国银行、交通银行等银行纷纷将总部迁至香港，使香港成为全中国的金融中心。大量来自中国的难民涌入加剧了香港本已拥挤的住房状况，也使香港的资源捉襟见肘，但同时也带动了土地买卖的繁荣，增加了政府收入。中国企业家不仅带来了资金，还移植了整座工厂，其中一些工厂生产军需品支援中国的战争。这为香港战后经济复苏奠定了坚实的工业基础。 +
The Hong Kong government’s policy toward the war in China was both shaped and constrained by the concerns of British defense policy.  +
Although the British military leadership had expected another world war and a conflict with Japan, it was eager to prevent any action against Japan that might drive Germany and Italy toward war in Europe.  +
The colonial government could not afford to provoke the Japanese government, especially when Hong Kong was declared a neutral zone in September 1938.  +
(The colonial government had been embarrassed in 1931 after the Japanese invasion of Manchuria provoked a rash of riots in which angry crowds looted Japanese shops, attacked Japanese residents, and murdered a Japanese family.  +
The hostilities continued for five days, and the army had to be called in to help the police keep order.) Thus, the Hong Kong government rejected the Chinese government’s pleas to arm local Chinese for helping the war effort on the mainland.  +
Similarly, the colonial government turned down requests by the Chinese unofficial members of the Legislative Council to send relief money to China.  +
The Hong Kong Red Cross Society was forbidden to send workers into the war zone.
香港政府对中国战争的政策既受到英国国防政策的影响，也受到其制约。尽管英国军方领导层预料到会再次爆发世界大战，并与日本发生冲突，但他们急于阻止任何可能将德国和意大利拖入欧洲战争的针对日本的行动。殖民政府无法承受激怒日本政府的后果，尤其是在1938年9月香港被宣布为中立区之后。（1931年，日本入侵满洲引发了一系列骚乱，愤怒的民众抢劫日本商店，袭击日本居民，并杀害了一个日本家庭，这令殖民政府颜面尽失。骚乱持续了五天，最终不得不调动军队协助警方维持秩序。）因此，香港政府拒绝了中国政府要求武装本地华人以支援大陆战争的请求。同样，殖民政府也拒绝了立法会中非官方议员提出的向中国提供救济金的请求。香港红十字会被禁止向战区派遣工作人员。 +
Yet the colonial government sympathized with China and was reluctant to alienate its Chinese subjects by clamping down on activities supporting the Chinese resistance.  +
It thus turned a blind eye to efforts by both the Chinese Nationalists and the Communists to funnel resources and draw international support for China’s war effort.  +
For the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), Hong Kong was a link to the outside world.  +
In January 1938, the colonial government allowed the CCP to establish a local office (disguised as a tea company in order not to violate British neutrality laws) of the Eighth Route Army, which raised donations of medicine and money from overseas Chinese.  +
The CCP also opened the Hong Kong News College and the China News Agency to train reporters and promote the Chinese war effort.  +
The Hong Kong branch of the Chinese National Anti-Japanese Literary Association and the Defend China League, headed by Song Qingling, widow of Sun Yat-sen, drummed up support for the Chinese cause.  +
Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist party, the Kuomintang, also had a strong presence in Hong Kong, where it published newspapers and continued its propaganda war.  +
Wang Jingwei and his faction, who later collaborated with the Japanese from Nanjing, broadcast their own propaganda through the South China Daily.
然而，殖民政府同情中国，不愿因镇压支持中国抗日活动而疏远其华人臣民。因此，它对国民党和共产党为中国抗战争取资源和国际社会支持的努力视而不见。对中国共产党而言，香港是其与外界联系的桥梁。1938 年 1 月，殖民政府允许中共在香港设立八路军办事处（为不违反英国中立法，该办事处伪装成一家茶叶公司），负责向海外华人募集药品和资金。中共还开办了香港新闻学院和中国新闻社，以培训记者并宣传中国抗日事业。由孙中山先生遗孀宋庆龄领导的中国抗日文人会香港分会和保卫中国同盟也积极为中国事业奔走呼吁。蒋介石的国民党在香港也拥有强大的影响力，它在那里出版报纸并继续进行宣传战。汪精卫及其派系后来与南京的日本人合作，通过 《南华日报》传播他们的宣传。 +
DEFENDING THE INDEFENSIBLE
为不可辩护之事辩护
While some British military officials had doubted that the Japanese were capable of challenging the mighty British Empire, more farsighted leaders realized as soon as full-scale war broke out with Germany in 1940 that Hong Kong could not be defended.  +
But they also stressed the need to hold on to the colony to maintain face and to prevent the harbor from falling into enemy hands.  +
Prime Minister Winston Churchill decided against reducing the local garrison, which would weaken both the prestige of the empire and the morale in China.  +
Yet the Hong Kong government was in a weak position to prepare for an invasion.  +
The huge number of refugees from China drained resources (by early 1941, the colony’s population was well over 1.5 million), while the colony’s status as a free port, coupled with its open border with China, made controlling immigration—not to mention the movement of Japanese agents and sympathizers—impossible.
尽管一些英国军方官员曾怀疑日本人是否有能力挑战强大的大英帝国，但更具远见的领导人在1940年与德国全面开战后立即意识到，香港已无力守住。然而，他们也强调必须坚守这片殖民地，以维护英国的颜面，并防止港口落入敌手。首相温斯顿·丘吉尔决定不削减驻港部队，因为这会削弱帝国的威望和打击中国的士气。然而，香港政府在应对入侵方面却处于弱势地位。大量来自中国的难民涌入耗尽了资源（到1941年初，香港人口已超过150万），而香港作为自由港的地位，加上与中国接壤的开放边界，使得控制移民——更不用说控制日本特工和同情者的流动——变得不可能。 +
The colonial government was thus in the unenviable position of preparing to defend a colony that could not be defended, even while maintaining its neutrality.  +
In September 1938 the government reinstated the Emergency Powers Ordinance of 1922, which allowed the police to deport anyone not employed; prohibit public meetings and organizations; censor Chinese newspapers, pamphlets, and placards; and call up a special force of constables.  +
They also allowed the government to control food prices, intern Chinese and Japanese soldiers taking refuge in Hong Kong, and prohibit repairing and provisioning Japanese or Chinese vessels involved in the hostilities.
因此，殖民政府陷入了进退两难的境地：一方面要准备保卫一个根本无法保卫的殖民地，另一方面又要维持中立。1938年9月，政府恢复了1922年的《紧急权力条例》，该条例授权警方驱逐所有无业人员；禁止公共集会和组织；审查中文报纸、小册子和标语；并征召一支特别警队。此外，该条例还允许政府控制食品价格，拘禁在香港避难的中国和日本士兵，并禁止维修和补给参与战争的日本或中国船只。 +
Even as the government was professing Hong Kong’s neutrality, it was preparing to defend the colony against a Japanese invasion.  +
In July 1939, all British male subjects of European origin between the ages of eighteen and fifty-five were made liable for compulsory service in the Defence Reserve.  +
After criticism from the local press and Chinese unofficial members of the Legislative Council, in summer 1940 the government began a program of air-raid tunnels.  +
In 1940, the colonial government evacuated a number of British women and children to Australia.  +
Among the evacuees were Eurasians holding British passports, who because of the Australian government’s White Australia policy were dropped off in Manila.  +
This provoked an outcry from Eurasian and Chinese leaders in Hong Kong.  +
In July 1941, Japanese assets in Hong Kong were frozen (as they were in Britain and the United States), although barter trading continued for a while.
尽管政府宣称香港保持中立，但实际上却在为抵御日本入侵做准备。1939年7月，所有年龄在18至55岁之间的欧洲裔英国男性公民都被强制征召入伍，加入国防预备役。在遭到本地媒体和立法会华人非官方议员的批评后，政府于1940年夏季开始修建防空隧道。同年，殖民地政府将一些英国妇女儿童撤离到澳大利亚。撤离者中包括一些持有英国护照的欧亚裔人士，由于澳大利亚政府的“白澳政策”，他们被直接送往马尼拉。这引起了香港欧亚裔和华裔领袖的强烈抗议。1941年7月，日本在香港的资产被冻结（如同在英国和美国一样），但易货贸易在一段时间内仍在继续。 +
Like all British colonies, Hong Kong became part of the British war effort once Britain declared war on Germany for invading Poland in September 1939.  +
Hong Kong had already been part of the Chinese war effort, its formally neutral status notwithstanding, but the fact that both China and Britain were now at war joined the Chinese and the British communities in common cause.  +
In April 1940 the colony contributed to the British war effort through new taxes and several gifts of cash.  +
The South China Morning Post organized a Bomber Fund, while both Chinese and expatriates contributed to campaigns such as the British Prisoners of War Fund, the British War Organization Fund, the Chinese Relief Association, and the Hong Kong and South China Branch of the British Fund for the Relief of Distress in China.  +
Under the Chinese Defence League’s “Bowl of Rice” campaign, donors ordered meals at participating restaurants but ate only a bowl of steamed rice, donating the price of the meal to the Chinese war effort.  +
Robert Ho Tung, the Eurasian tycoon, donated a vessel to the Hong Kong Naval Volunteer Force.
与所有英国殖民地一样，1939 年 9 月英国因德国入侵波兰而对德宣战后，香港也加入了英国的战争行动。尽管香港名义上保持中立，但此前它已参与了中国的战争行动。然而，中英两国同时参战的事实，使得香港的华人社群和英国侨民团结在了同一阵线。1940 年 4 月，香港通过增税和捐款等方式为英国的战争行动做出了贡献。 《南华早报》 组织了轰炸机基金，华人及侨民也纷纷捐款，支持英国战俘基金、英国战争组织基金、华人救济会以及英国救济中国灾民基金会香港及华南分会等机构。在中华民国防卫同盟发起的“一碗饭”活动中，捐款者在参与活动的餐厅点餐，但只吃一碗米饭，并将餐费捐给中国抗战。欧亚混血富豪何东向香港海军志愿部队捐赠了一艘船。 +
Despite the Chinese community’s generous contributions to both war efforts, the colonial government doubted that it could rely on the Chinese to help defend the colony.  +
The official view was that because most Chinese considered Hong Kong a temporary home, they were incapable of making any sacrifice for Hong Kong.  +
Yet the government had done little over the previous century to evince the type of loyalty that it now sought from its Chinese subjects.  +
Nor had the government shown that it trusted the Chinese enough to enlist them to defend the colony.  +
Only in May 1938 was a Chinese company added to the Volunteer Defence Corps, founded in 1855 before the Second Opium War.  +
And only after the Chinese members of the Legislative Council had assured the governor of Chinese support were British subjects of Chinese extraction allowed to register for the Defence Reserve.  +
Although the British War Office finally agreed to accept Chinese infantry forces in October 1941, the minimum height and weight restrictions kept many of them out: of the six hundred who applied, only thirty-five were accepted.
尽管华人社群对两次战争都做出了慷慨的贡献，但殖民政府仍然怀疑能否依靠华人保卫殖民地。官方观点认为，由于大多数华人将香港视为暂时的居所，他们无法为香港做出任何牺牲。然而，在过去一个世纪里，政府几乎没有展现出如今所寻求的那种华人忠诚。政府也从未表现出对华人的足够信任，以至于可以征召他们保卫殖民地。直到1938年5月，一支华人连队才被纳入成立于1855年、第二次鸦片战争之前的志愿防卫队。而且，只有在立法会华人议员向总督保证华人的支持后，拥有华人血统的英国公民才被允许登记加入国防预备队。尽管英国陆军部最终在1941年10月同意接收华人步兵部队，但最低身高和体重限制将许多人拒之门外：在600名申请者中，只有35人被录取。 +
THE FALL OF HONG KONG
香港陷落
On December 8, 1941, Hong Kong time, Japanese bombers attacked Hong Kong, Malaya, Pearl Harbor, and the Philippines.  +
Within as many minutes, five Royal Air Force aircraft at Kai Tak airfield in Kowloon had been destroyed.  +
As Japanese troops moved swiftly across the New Territories and into Kowloon, propaganda leaflets declaring “Asia for the Asians” called on Chinese and Indians in the colony to rise up and drive out their British exploiters.  +
Within seventeen days, the Japanese took Hong Kong Island, occupying the entire colony until August 30, 1945.  +
On Christmas Day, one week after the Japanese launched a three-pronged attack on Hong Kong Island, Governor Mark Young, who had arrived in the colony in September from Barbados, surrendered unconditionally to Lieutenant General Sakai Takashi.  +
By February 1942, after the fall of Malaya and Singapore, the sun had set over Britain’s empire in East Asia.
1941年12月8日（香港时间），日军轰炸机袭击了香港、马来亚、珍珠港和菲律宾。短短几分钟内，九龙启德机场的五架英国皇家空军飞机便被摧毁。随着日军迅速推进至新界并进入九龙，印有“亚洲人的亚洲”字样的宣传单号呼吁殖民地内的华人和印度人奋起反抗，驱逐英国剥削者。短短十七天内，日军占领了香港岛，并一直占领整个殖民地直至1945年8月30日。圣诞节当天，也就是日军对香港岛发动三路进攻一周后，于9月从巴巴多斯抵达香港的总督杨明向酒井隆中将无条件投降。到1942年2月，随着马来亚和新加坡的陷落，英国在东亚的帝国也走向了终结。 +
Why did the British resistance fall apart so quickly? A better question might be, given the overwhelming strength of the Japanese forces, why did Hong Kong not fall even earlier? Although critics later complained that the British should have put up a stiffer resistance, both regular troops and volunteers followed Churchill’s orders to fight to the end.  +
When Governor Young finally surrendered, he did so after rejecting three earlier offers of surrender and partly to prevent the Japanese invaders from committing the kind of atrocities they had inflicted on the city of Nanjing in 1938.  +
On the eve of the invasion, the Hong Kong side, led by Major General Christopher Maltby, had approximately ten thousand forces—including two British battalions, the Hong Kong Volunteers, two Indian infantry battalions, and two battalions of infantry offered by the Canadian government—and a small number of airplanes and ships, with no chances of any naval reinforcements.  +
A false announcement by the British military on December 20 that some sixty thousand Chinese troops were on their way may have raised morale, but it could not alter the fact that the Japanese side enjoyed clear superiority at sea, on land, and in the air.  +
The Japanese had more than twenty thousand troops as well as more and better planes and ships and could always count on reinforcements from within China.  +
By the time three of Chiang Kai-shek’s divisions arrived in Canton to attack the Japanese forces there, Hong Kong had already fallen.  +
As the title of Tony Banham’s recent study of the invasion suggests, the colony had “not the slightest chance.”1
英国的抵抗为何如此迅速地瓦解？或许更恰当的问题应该是，鉴于日军的绝对优势，香港为何没有更早陷落？尽管后来有批评人士抱怨英国本应进行更顽强的抵抗，但正规军和志愿军都遵照丘吉尔的命令战斗到了最后一刻。杨总督最终投降之前，曾三次拒绝投降提议，部分原因是为了阻止日军侵略者重蹈 1938 年南京大屠杀的覆辙。在入侵前夕，由克里斯托弗·马尔特比少将指挥的香港方面拥有约一万人的兵力——包括两个英国营、香港志愿军、两个印度步兵营和加拿大政府提供的两个步兵营——以及少量飞机和舰船，而且没有任何海上增援的希望。 12 月 20 日，英国军方谎称约有六万中国军队正在赶来，这或许提振了士气，但却无法改变日军在海陆空三方面都占据绝对优势的事实。日军拥有两万多兵力，以及更多更先进的飞机和舰船，而且随时可以从中国境内获得增援。当蒋介石的三个师抵达广州准备进攻日军时，香港已经沦陷。正如托尼·班纳姆（Tony Banham）近期出版的关于这场入侵的著作标题所示，香港“毫无胜算” 。 +
Whereas the British commanders were almost all new to Hong Kong (Maltby had arrived only in August) and the two battalions of Canadian infantry were still being trained, the Japanese had several years of experience fighting in China, and many of their troops had been training together for the assault on Hong Kong.  +
British defense plans changed late in 1941 from defending only Hong Kong Island to holding down the Japanese at the Gin Drinkers’ Line—a series of pillboxes running eleven miles from Gin Drinkers’ Bay in western Hong Kong to Port Shelter in the eastern region—and then retreating to defend Hong Kong Island.  +
This did not leave enough time for effective planning and training.  +
The British also failed to use the local Chinese effectively; the some 450 who volunteered were used primarily in service positions.  +
The British, who moved mainly by road, were hamstrung when their military transport system fell apart.  +
Helped by spies along the way, the fit, organized, and well-equipped Japanese moved quickly by foot, often at night.
尽管英军指挥官几乎都是初来乍到（马尔特比八月才抵达香港），两个加拿大步兵营也仍在接受训练，但日军却在中国战场上拥有数年的作战经验，而且许多部队都曾为进攻香港进行过联合训练。1941年末，英军的防御计划发生了改变，从仅守卫香港岛转变为在“饮酒者防线”（一条从香港西部的饮酒者湾延伸至东部避风港的碉堡群，全长11英里）阻击日军，然后撤退至香港岛进行防御。这样的改变使得英军没有足够的时间进行有效的计划和训练。此外，英军也未能有效地利用当地华人；约450名志愿兵主要被安排在后勤岗位。英军主要依靠陆路推进，但其军事运输系统崩溃后，行动举步维艰。在沿途间谍的帮助下，体格健壮、组织严密、装备精良的日军迅速徒步推进，而且经常在夜间行动。 +
The British had weak, outdated, and insufficient artillery and ammunition.  +
Their persistently weak intelligence underestimated the size and quality of the Japanese forces.  +
The Japanese had much better intelligence, obtained over several years by placing agents throughout Hong Kong in various civilian positions.  +
(Several Japanese residents suddenly appeared in Japanese military uniforms shortly after the surrender.) Large numbers of Japanese merchants had been in Hong Kong since the 1930s, and almost one hundred Japanese remained in Hong Kong in late 1941.  +
A Japanese intelligence map, now housed in the Harvard University Map Collection, shows just how well the Japanese knew their target.  +
Based on British maps, this meticulously detailed map includes administrative boundaries, railway tracks, roads and paths, telephone and telegraph lines, wireless transmitters and underwater cables, police stations and post offices, telegraph and telephone offices, schools, hospitals, churches, temples, pagodas, cemeteries, wells, orchards, marshes and wetlands, uncultivated and barren areas, and both deciduous and coniferous forests.
英国的火炮和弹药薄弱、陈旧且不足。他们长期以来情报能力不足，低估了日军的规模和素质。日军的情报则要好得多，这是他们多年来通过在香港各处安插特工，渗透到各个平民岗位而获得的。（投降后不久，一些日本居民突然身着日军制服出现在香港。）自20世纪30年代以来，大量日本商人就已在香港定居，到1941年末，仍有近百名日本人留在香港。现藏于哈佛大学地图收藏馆的一幅日本情报地图，清晰地展现了日军对目标的了解程度。这张根据英国地图绘制的精细地图包含了行政边界、铁路轨道、道路和小径、电话和电报线路、无线电发射机和海底电缆、警察局和邮局、电报局和电话局、学校、医院、教堂、寺庙、宝塔、墓地、水井、果园、沼泽和湿地、未开垦和荒地，以及落叶林和针叶林。 +
The human costs of the invasion are unclear.  +
British sources estimated 2,311 troops killed or missing and around the same number wounded, but a recent study places the number closer to 1,560 dead or missing.  +
Japanese figures are less reliable, ranging from initial reports of only 675 killed or missing and 2,079 wounded to the equally dubious report by Tokyo later of 7,000 killed and 20,000 wounded; a more realistic estimate is around 2,000 killed and between 5,000 and 6,000 wounded.  +
As in most wars, it is impossible to tell how many civilians were killed in the invasion.  +
One estimate places the dead at 4,000 and the wounded at 3,000, but the actual numbers were probably much higher.2
入侵造成的人员伤亡尚不明确。英国方面估计有 2311 名士兵阵亡或失踪，受伤人数也大致相同，但最近的一项研究认为死亡或失踪人数更接近 1560 人。日方的数据则不太可靠，最初报告的死亡或失踪人数仅为 675 人，受伤人数为 2079 人，而东京方面后来发布的同样存疑的报告则称有 7000 人阵亡，20000 人受伤；更为合理的估计是约 2000 人阵亡，5000 至 6000 人受伤 。 与大多数战争一样，无法确定入侵中有多少平民丧生。一种估计认为死亡人数为 4000 人，受伤人数为 3000 人，但实际数字可能远高于此。 +
THE JAPANESE OCCUPATION  日本占领时期
Thus began the three years and eight months of “The Captured Territory of Hong Kong,” which although touted as part of Japan’s “Great East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere” was little more than Japanese colonialism.  +
Despite their anticolonial rhetoric, the Japanese quickly transformed Hong Kong from a British colony into a Japanese one.  +
Statues of British royalty were removed, while street and place names were replaced with Japanese names (Queen’s Road, for example, became Meiji Road).  +
Even the racehorses at Happy Valley were bestowed with Japanese names.  +
The new rulers also Japanized the landscape with various monuments and a cemetery in Causeway Bay for the Japanese horses killed during the invasion, to which Chinese residents were forced to bow.  +
Replacing the Gregorian calendar with the Japanese calendar (based on the contemporary emperor’s reign), the Japanese introduced their own holidays, such as the emperor’s birthday, the Yasukuni Festival for Japanese war dead, and Empire Day or National Foundation Day.  +
In May 1943, the new authorities established the East Asia Academy to introduce potential government servants, teachers, and businessmen to Japanese morals and customs.  +
As an official Japanese publication explained, since Hong Kong was now a “Hong Kong for the East Asians,” it was time for the “poisonous remains of British cultural leftovers” to be “thoroughly eradicated.”3
于是，长达三年零八个月的“香港占领区”开始了。尽管日本将其标榜为“大东亚共荣圈”的一部分，但实际上却沦为日本殖民统治的温床。尽管日本人高喊反殖民口号，但他们迅速将香港从英国殖民地变成了日本殖民地。英国皇室的雕像被移除，街道和地名也被替换成日语名称（例如，皇后大道变成了明治道）。就连跑马地的赛马也被赋予了日语名字。新的统治者还通过各种纪念碑和铜锣湾的马匹墓地来“日本化”香港的景观，这些纪念碑和墓地是为了安葬在入侵中被杀死的日本战马，中国居民被迫向这些纪念碑鞠躬。日本人用日本历（以当时的日本天皇在位年为准）取代了公历，并引入了自己的节日，例如天皇诞辰、为纪念日本战争死难者的靖国神社以及帝国日或建国日。 1943 年 5 月，新当局成立了东亚学院，旨在向未来的政府官员、教师和商人介绍日本的道德和习俗。正如一份日本官方出版物所解释的那样，既然香港现在是“东亚人的香港”，就应该“彻底清除”英国文化残余的“毒害” 。³ +
Although they portrayed their invasion as liberation from colonialism, as elsewhere in their new empire the Japanese in Hong Kong soon showed that they could be far more brutal than the British had ever been.  +
On January 4, 1942, all of Hong Kong’s British, American, and Dutch residents were arrested.  +
The Japanese displayed their victory over the British for Hong Kong’s non-European population to see, parading prisoners of war through the streets and forcing Allied captives to bow to Chinese, pull rickshaws, and clean the streets.  +
Most of the British civilians were imprisoned in Stanley, on the south side of Hong Kong Island, while the military prisoners were held at a former British camp at Sham Shui Po in Kowloon.  +
Although most of the Americans were repatriated, the head of the Stanley internment camp, Frank Gimson, who had arrived as colonial secretary the day before the Japanese invasion, insisted that the British civilians remain in Hong Kong as a show of force.  +
Many civilian and military prisoners were executed; others died of disease and malnourishment.  +
But even though Prime Minister Tojo Hideki ordered that the European prisoners have only the barest of rations, the British in Hong Kong had it better than their counterparts in some of the Japanese camps in Southeast Asia.  +
In Hong Kong, writes historian Philip Snow, “the keynote of their treatment was humiliation rather than brutality for the sake of it.” Still, the “combined shock of the defeat and internment” undermined the “entire pre-war edifice of British supremacy in Hong Kong.”4
尽管他们将入侵描绘成摆脱殖民统治的解放，但正如他们在新帝国的其他地方一样，日军在香港很快就展现出比英国人更加残暴的一面。1942 年 1 月 4 日，所有在香港的英国、美国和荷兰居民都被逮捕。日军向香港的非欧洲裔居民展示他们战胜英国的“胜利”，押着战俘游街示众，强迫盟军俘虏向中国人鞠躬、拉人力车、打扫街道。大多数英国平民被关押在香港岛南侧的赤柱，而军事俘虏则被关押在九龙深水埗的一处前英国战俘营。虽然大多数美国人被遣返回国，但赤柱战俘营的负责人弗兰克·吉姆森（Frank Gimson）——他在日军入侵前一天刚刚以殖民地大臣的身份抵达香港——坚持要求英国平民留在香港，以示武力。许多平民和军事俘虏被处决；其他人则死于疾病和营养不良。尽管东条英机首相下令只给欧洲战俘提供最基本的口粮，但香港的英国战俘的境遇却比东南亚一些日军战俘营中的战俘要好。历史学家菲利普·斯诺写道，在香港，“他们所受待遇的重点是羞辱，而非单纯的残暴”。然而，“战败和拘禁的双重打击”动摇了“战前英国在香港的统治根基” 。⁴ +

Those who suffered the most, both in the invasion and during the occupation, were the same people the Japanese repeatedly insisted were not their enemies: the Chinese.  +
The Japanese authorities tried to reduce Hong Kong’s population by repatriating the refugees who had come from China in the years leading up to the invasion.  +
In early January 1942, they announced that anyone without residence or employment would have to leave.  +
Although the Japanese had a hard time enforcing this policy, within a year Hong Kong’s population had dropped from more than 1.5 million to 1 million.  +
By the end of the occupation in August 1945, it was under six hundred thousand.  +
In three and a half years, at least ten thousand Hong Kong civilians were executed, while many others were tortured, raped, or mutilated.  +
Army officers were even more vicious than their men, but the most systematically brutal were the Kempeitai, the notorious Japanese military police who routinely performed executions by beheading at King’s Park in Kowloon and used Chinese for shooting or bayonet practice.  +
Dorothy Lee, a social worker, recalled how everyone lived “in fear of the ‘midnight knock.’ The Japanese might come to your door at any time to take over your house or flat and, in the early days, they came into rape.” Lee saw one Japanese corporal known as “the killer” personally behead twelve civilians within several minutes.5
在入侵和占领期间遭受苦难最深的，恰恰是日本人反复强调并非敌人的群体：中国人。日本当局试图通过遣返在入侵前几年从中国大陆涌入的难民来减少香港人口。1942 年 1 月初，他们宣布所有无居留权或无业人员必须离开。尽管日本人难以执行这项政策，但一年之内，香港人口就从 150 多万锐减至 100 万。到 1945 年 8 月占领结束时，香港人口已不足 60 万。在三年半的时间里，至少有一万名香港平民被处决，另有许多人遭受酷刑、强奸或残害。军官比士兵更加残暴，但最残暴的当属宪兵队，这支臭名昭著的日本宪兵队经常在九龙京士柏执行斩首处决，并强迫中国人进行射击或刺刀练习。社会工作者多萝西·李回忆说，当时每个人都生活在“午夜敲门”的恐惧之中。“日本人随时可能敲门，占领你的房子或公寓，在早期，他们还会强奸。”李亲眼目睹一名被称为“杀手”的日本下士在几分钟内斩首了十二名平民 。5 +
Although the Japanese created countless atrocities throughout their empire, Hong Kong’s unique situation may have encouraged the scope and intensity of this brutality.  +
As they did in Malaya, Indochina, and Indonesia, many Japanese administrators and soldiers resented the Chinese of Hong Kong for supposedly having served their European overlords so willingly.  +
Unlike the colonies of Southeast Asia, however, Hong Kong lacked the natural resources to make conquest worthwhile.  +
Although the new regime introduced a program for reopening factories to produce goods such as shoes made with rubber from Indochina and Malaya, the Japanese economic record was disastrous.  +
Shortages and price increases were exacerbated by orders from Tokyo to confiscate anything of value and send it to Japan.  +
By late 1942, when the war was going badly for Japan, the governor tried even more vigorously to restrict Hong Kong’s scarce resources for the Japanese troops.  +
In January 1943, the Kempeitai set two German shepherds on a group of Chinese women who had been gathering grass for fuel.  +
Only after the dogs had chewed pieces of flesh out of them were the women released.  +
As the colony’s overseas trade suffered, by mid-1943 the food shortage became even more unbearable.  +
Several hundred corpses—some with parts of their thighs and buttocks removed for food—littered the streets every day, and many residents survived only by eating rats.  +
The weakening of central government control and the expansion of corruption that accompanied Japan’s failing war effort made conditions even worse and “opened the way to an orgy of private greed.” Uncontrolled and free to do as it pleased, the Kempeitai in Hong Kong created an “empire unmatched by the Kempeitai branches in any other Japanese-occupied zone” and “waxed fat on the narcotics trade.”6
尽管日本在其帝国境内犯下了无数暴行，但香港的特殊情况或许助长了这种暴行的规模和强度。如同在马来亚、印度支那和印度尼西亚一样，许多日本官员和士兵对香港华人心怀怨恨，认为他们心甘情愿地为欧洲统治者效力。然而，与东南亚殖民地不同，香港缺乏足以支撑日本征服的自然资源。尽管新政权推行了一项计划，重开工厂生产诸如用来自印度支那和马来亚的橡胶制成的鞋子等商品，但日本的经济记录却惨不忍睹。东京下令没收一切值钱的东西运回日本，加剧了物资短缺和物价上涨的局面。到1942年末，随着战争形势对日本不利，港督更加肆无忌惮地限制香港本就稀缺的资源，以供应日军。1943年1月，宪兵队放出两只德国牧羊犬，袭击了一群正在采集草料作为燃料的中国妇女。只有当恶犬从她们身上啃噬掉肉块后，这些妇女才被释放。随着殖民地海外贸易的衰落，到1943年中期，粮食短缺变得更加难以忍受。每天都有数百具尸体——有些尸体的大腿和臀部被割去食用——横尸街头，许多居民只能靠吃老鼠勉强生存。中央政府控制力的削弱以及伴随日本战争失败而来的腐败蔓延，使情况雪上加霜，“为私人贪婪的狂欢打开了方便之门”。“不受控制且为所欲为的香港宪兵队建立了一个‘其他任何日本占领区的宪兵队分支机构都无法比拟的帝国’，并且‘靠毒品交易发了财’。6 +
Despite some provisions under the Japanese for educating Hong Kong’s poor, the education system practically fell apart.  +
Whereas more than one hundred thousand children were enrolled in school before the war, by the end of the war this number had plummeted to around three thousand.  +
Yet any account of the Japanese occupation must also include some of the more positive changes.  +
Snow argues that the Japanese brought more Chinese into the “central administration of the colony than the British had ever done.”7 The Japanese practice of delegating tasks gave Chinese a larger role than under the British, while the Japanese also created a network of district bureaus, which the British never had.  +
Unlike the British, the Japanese went to great lengths to publicize and explain their policies to the Chinese.  +
The Japanese also made some positive changes in public health and agriculture.  +
With “something close to a mania” for preserving public health—mainly to protect the health of Japanese soldiers—they kept outbreaks of smallpox and cholera minor compared with the prewar years.8
尽管日军时期曾为香港贫困儿童提供一些教育，但教育体系实际上已经崩溃。战前，香港有超过十万名儿童入学，而到战争结束时，入学人数骤降至三千人左右。然而，任何对日占时期的描述都必须包含一些较为积极的改变。斯诺认为，日军让更多华人进入“殖民地中央行政机构”，其程度远超英国时期。 7 日军的委派制度赋予华人比英国时期更大的权力，同时，日军还建立了英国从未有过的地区局网络。与英国不同，日军不遗余力地向华人宣传和解释其政策。日军在公共卫生和农业方面也取得了一些积极进展。他们近乎狂热地维护公共卫生——主要是为了保护日本士兵的健康——使得天花和霍乱的爆发与战前相比大大减少。 8 +
Collaboration took different forms and assumed various levels of intensity.  +
As soon as the Japanese flag was raised in Central District on December 27, Japanese flags appeared all over the area, and Hong Kong’s new rulers had no trouble finding recruits for their administration.  +
Some Chinese may have believed in Japan’s rhetoric of “Asia for the Asians,” but most people in Hong Kong, relieved that the invasion was over, collaborated simply to get by.  +
For the Eurasians who were recruited for the same kinds of clerical and secretarial posts that they had held under the British and had nowhere else to go, collaboration must have seemed a rather logical choice.  +
The writers for the Hong Kong News, which had been published before the war by Japanese businessmen and was revived by the occupation authorities, were mainly Eurasians and Indians.  +
Many Eurasians and Portuguese became brokers between the Japanese administration and the Chinese population, running various black or gray markets.  +
The Japanese also tried hard to win over the Indian population, promising to help them drive the British out of India.  +
Some Britons also worked with the Japanese; for example, high-level bankers chose to collaborate to ensure some level of financial stability.  +
Similarly, P.  +
S.  +
Selwyn-Clarke, the former director of medical services, worked with the Japanese for the sake of the Chinese community and the interned Europeans and prisoners of war.
合作的形式多种多样，强度也各不相同。12 月 27 日，日本国旗在香港中环升起后，日本国旗随即出现在香港各处，新统治者也毫不费力地招募人员加入其行政机构。一些中国人或许认同日本“亚洲人的亚洲”的口号，但大多数香港人，在侵略结束的喜悦中，为了生存而选择合作。对于那些被招募从事与英国统治时期相同文秘工作的欧亚混血儿来说，他们别无选择，只能继续从事文秘工作，因此合作似乎是一个合乎逻辑的选择。 《香港新闻》的撰稿人主要由欧亚混血儿和印度人组成， 该报战前由日本商人创办，后被占领当局恢复发行。许多欧亚混血儿和葡萄牙人成为日本政府与中国民众之间的中间人，经营着各种黑市或灰色市场。日本人还竭力拉拢印度民众，承诺帮助他们将英国人赶出印度。一些英国人也与日本人合作；例如，一些高级银行家选择与日本人合作，以确保一定程度的金融稳定。同样，前医疗服务主管塞尔温-克拉克也为了华人社区以及被拘禁的欧洲人和战俘的利益而与日本人合作。 +
To consolidate their rule, the Japanese tried to recruit the same community leaders who had worked with the British.  +
On January 10, 1942, two weeks after the British surrender, Lieutenant General Sakai invited some 130 of the leading Chinese and Eurasians to a formal luncheon at the Peninsula Hotel in Kowloon.  +
Sakai insisted that the war in Hong Kong was against Britain, not China, and that the Chinese and Japanese should work together for the prosperity of all the races of Greater East Asia.  +
Lieutenant General Isogai Rensuke, who became governor later that month, established two councils consisting of Chinese and Eurasian leaders for managing the Chinese population.  +
On the Chinese Representative Council were Robert Kotewall, the chair; Lau Tit-shing, manager of the Communications Bank and chairman of the Chinese Bankers’ Association; Li Tse-fong, manager of the Bank of East Asia (which had maintained extensive contacts with Japanese firms before the war) and former unofficial member of the Legislative Council; and Chan Lim-pak, who had once been comprador to the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank in Canton.  +
The Chinese Cooperative Council, whose 22 members were selected by the Chinese Representative Council from the leading professionals, was chaired by Chow Shouson.
为了巩固统治，日本人试图招募那些曾与英国人合作过的社区领袖。1942年1月10日，英国投降两周后，酒井中将邀请约130位华裔和欧亚裔领袖在九龙半岛酒店举行正式午宴。酒井强调，香港战争是针对英国而非中国，华裔和日裔应该携手合作，为大东亚各族人民的繁荣而努力。当月晚些时候就任香港总督的矶贝廉介中将成立了两个由华裔和欧亚裔领袖组成的委员会，负责管理华裔居民。华裔代表委员会成员包括：主席罗伯特·科特沃尔；交通银行经理兼华人银行家协会主席刘铁成；东亚银行经理（该银行在战前与日本企业保持着广泛的联系）兼前立法会非正式成员李泽峰；还有曾任香港上海汇丰银行广州买办的陈林柏。中国合作社理事会由中国代表理事会从业内顶尖专业人士中选出的22名成员组成，主席是周寿臣。 +
Some Chinese leaders were enthusiastic about working with the Japanese.  +
Lau Tit-shing, for example, was president of the Chinese-Japanese Returned-Students Association and, according to sociologist Henry Lethbridge, was “very pro-Japanese,” having been “thoroughly brainwashed by his early education in Japan.”9 When Lau died in April 1945, he was honored by the Japanese governor.  +
Chan Lim-pak had been arrested by the British during the Japanese invasion on charges of “defeatist talk” and aiding the enemy.  +
He was killed in 1944 by an American bomber while en route to Japan.  +
But most Chinese and Eurasian leaders probably collaborated with the Japanese in the same way the majority of Hong Kong’s population did: “with reluctance and misgiving, and as a matter of physical survival.”10 Fear and pragmatism were no doubt strong reasons for collaborating, as was preserving their own class interests.  +
And many collaborated with the Japanese to help the local community.  +
Indeed, three colonial officers testified after the war that they had met secretly with Chow Shouson and Robert Kotewall shortly before the fall of Hong Kong and requested that they cooperate with the Japanese to protect the interests of the Chinese community.  +
That there was so little Chinese resentment toward the two Chinese councils during the occupation suggests that most Chinese understood that the Chinese and Eurasian leaders had to cooperate.
一些华人领袖热衷于与日本人合作。例如，刘铁成是中日归国学生会会长，据社会学家亨利·莱斯布里奇（Henry Lethbridge）称，他“非常亲日”，因为他“在日本接受的早期教育彻底洗脑”。 9 刘铁成于 1945 年 4 月去世时，受到日本总督的追悼。陈林柏在日本入侵期间被英国人以“宣战言论”和“援助敌人”的罪名逮捕。1944 年，他在前往日本的途中被美国轰炸机击毙。但大多数华人及欧亚混血领袖与日本人的合作方式，可能与香港的大多数民众一样：“出于不情愿和疑虑，以及为了生存而合作”。 10 恐惧和实用主义无疑是他们合作的重要原因，维护自身阶级利益也是如此。许多人与日本人合作也是为了帮助当地社区。事实上，战后有三名殖民地官员作证称，他们在香港沦陷前不久曾与周寿締和罗伯特·科特沃尔秘密会面，请求他们与日军合作，以保护华人社区的利益。在日占时期，华人对这两个华人委员会几乎没有怨恨，这表明大多数华人都明白，华人与欧亚领导人必须合作。 +
Just as collaboration during the Japanese occupation took many forms, so did resistance.  +
As they had under the British, many Chinese simply ignored the regulations and proclamations issued by the Japanese authorities.  +
Chinese staff in the governor’s office often failed to show up for their mandatory Japanese classes; clerks at Chinese-run department stores refused to sell goods to Japanese, pretending that they were out of stock; and entire schools moved to unoccupied parts of the mainland rather than comply with the new curriculum.  +
By summer 1943, people in Hong Kong realized that the war no longer favored the Japanese.  +
By 1944, Chinese and Eurasian leaders started to avoid their duties on the two Chinese councils.
正如日占时期合作的形式多种多样，抵抗的形式也同样如此。如同在英国统治时期一样，许多华人干脆无视日本当局颁布的规章制度和公告。总督府的华人工作人员经常缺席强制性的日语课程；华人经营的百货商店的店员拒绝向日本人出售商品，谎称缺货；甚至有整所学校为了不遵守新的课程安排，迁往大陆未被占领的地区。到了1943年夏天，香港民众意识到战争的局势已不再对日本有利。到了1944年，华人及欧亚领导人开始逃避他们在两个华人委员会的职责。 +
Given Hong Kong’s urban nature, most organized resistance occurred in the rural New Territories, especially along the Chinese border.  +
Led by Lindsay Ride, a professor at the University of Hong Kong and a member of the Volunteer Defence Corps who had escaped from the Sham Shui Po prison camp, and with help from local Chinese such as Paul Tsui, a recent graduate of the University of Hong Kong, the British Army Aid Group (BAAG) helped European and Chinese residents escape from Hong Kong, gathered intelligence, and rescued Allied airmen shot down by the Japanese.  +
Based in Guilin in southern China, the BAAG was technically a noncombat unit of the Indian Army.  +
By late 1942, the Chinese Nationalists had revived an underground movement, while the Communist guerrillas of the East River Column were active in the New Territories and in the urban areas of Hong Kong.  +
Despite the mutual suspicions among the British, Nationalists, Communists, and their respective agendas, this joint resistance helped to break down racial divisions between Britons and Chinese and to create a “camaraderie unimaginable in the pre-war years.”11
鉴于香港的城市特性，大多数有组织的抵抗运动都发生在新界乡村地区，尤其是在与中国接壤的地区。由香港大学教授、曾从深水埗战俘营逃脱的义勇军成员林赛·赖德领导，并得到香港大学应届毕业生徐保罗等当地华人协助，英国陆军援助团（BAAG）帮助欧洲和中国居民逃离香港，收集情报，并营救被日军击落的盟军飞行员。英国陆军援助团总部设在中国南方桂林，名义上是印度陆军的非战斗部队。到 1942 年末，国民党已恢复地下抵抗运动，而东江纵队的共产党游击队则在新界和香港市区活动。尽管英国人、国民党人和共产党人之间存在着相互猜忌，并且各自怀有不同的政治目的，但这种联合抵抗有助于打破英国人和中国人之间的种族隔阂，并创造了一种“战前难以想象的友谊”。 11 +
WARTIME PLANNING AND THE RACE TO RECOVER HONG KONG
战时计划与香港的收复竞赛
British planning for postwar Hong Kong began almost immediately after the fall to Japan, which, compounded by the loss of Singapore and Malaya, was a terrible blow to British morale.  +
As the Colonial Office began to reassess the British failure to defend Hong Kong, one of the conclusions was that the British should have relied more on local Chinese and accepted help from Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist forces.  +
Some wartime planners argued that the invasion might even be a chance for the British to start afresh in Hong Kong after the war by building a better sense of community between the British and the Chinese, including by opening higher-level government positions to local Chinese.  +
They were especially eager to prevent the type of anticolonial nationalism that had erupted in India and would eventually lead to independence in 1947.
英国战后对香港的规划几乎在香港沦陷后立即启动。新加坡和马来亚的失守，加上香港的沦陷，对英国士气造成了沉重打击。随着殖民地事务部开始重新评估英国在保卫香港方面的失败，其中一个结论是，英国本应更多地依靠当地华人，并接受蒋介石国民党军队的援助。一些战时规划者认为，入侵香港或许是英国战后在香港重建的契机，可以通过加强英籍华人之间的社群意识，包括向当地华人开放高级政府职位，来促进香港的重建。他们尤其渴望阻止像印度那样爆发的反殖民民族主义浪潮，这种浪潮最终导致了1947年的独立。 +
The British plans for recovering Hong Kong, however, faced opposition from both China and the United States.  +
With help from American president Franklin Delano Roosevelt (whose grandfather had been a partner in the American firm of Russell and whose mother had once lived in Hong Kong), in January 1942 Chiang Kai-shek became the supreme allied commander of the China-Burma-India Theater.  +
Chiang hoped to use the war to recover Hong Kong and to end the embarrassing unequal treaties.  +
Supported by the United States, in mid-1942 Chiang’s Nationalists approached Britain to give up Hong Kong, or at least the New Territories.  +
In late 1942, Sino-British negotiations began for abolishing extraterritoriality in China and revising the status of the New Territories after the war.  +
At the Cairo Conference of November 1943, Roosevelt promised to help Chiang recover Hong Kong if he agreed to help the Chinese Communists fight the Japanese.
然而，英国收复香港的计划遭到了中国和美国的反对。在美国总统富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福（其祖父曾是美国罗素公司的合伙人，其母也曾在香港居住）的帮助下，蒋介石于1942年1月成为中缅印战区盟军最高统帅。蒋介石希望利用这场战争收复香港，并废除那些令中英难堪的不平等条约。在美国的支持下，蒋介石的国民党于1942年中期向英国施压，要求其放弃香港，或至少放弃新界。1942年末，中英双方开始就废除中国治外法权和战后修订新界地位进行谈判。在1943年11月的开罗会议上，罗斯福承诺，如果蒋介石同意帮助中国共产党抗击日本，美国将帮助蒋介石收复香港。 +
Even while wartime planners in Britain were committed to restoring Hong Kong to British rule after the war, they also realized that the Chinese Nationalists’ demands would have to be taken seriously and that conditions in postwar Hong Kong would have to be different.  +
Although the Nationalists suddenly aborted their campaign to recover the New Territories—content for the time being with the agreement that China would reserve the right to raise the issue at a later time—some British officials believed that Hong Kong might have to be surrendered for Britain to focus on its other possessions, especially India and Egypt.  +
Realizing that many American officials supported China, some British officials even suggested giving up Hong Kong before the United States applied pressure on Britain to do so.  +
In mid-1942, the Colonial Office conceded that Hong Kong might have to be surrendered after the war.  +
Even in late 1945, George Kitson, head of the China Department at the Foreign Office, suggested that Britain return Hong Kong for both symbolic and practical purposes: as a token of gratitude for China’s help in defeating Japan, as a gesture of friendship in a new postwar world, as proof that British colonialism was entering a new phase, and as a preemptive move to prevent possible confrontation with China over the region.
尽管英国战时规划者致力于战后将香港归还英国统治，但他们也意识到必须认真对待中国国民党的要求，战后香港的状况必须有所不同。虽然国民党突然中止了收复新界的行动——暂时满足于中国保留日后提出该问题的权利——但一些英国官员认为，为了让英国集中精力发展其他殖民地，特别是印度和埃及，香港可能不得不被割让。由于意识到许多美国官员支持中国，一些英国官员甚至建议在美国向英国施压之前就放弃香港。1942年年中，殖民地事务部承认，战后香港可能不得不被割让。即使到了 1945 年末，外交部中国司司长乔治·基特森仍然建议英国归还香港，这既有象征意义，也有实际意义：作为对中国在击败日本方面所提供帮助的感激之情，作为战后新世界中友谊的姿态，作为英国殖民主义进入新阶段的证明，以及作为防止与中国在该地区发生可能冲突的先发制人措施。 +
As the war turned against Japan’s favor, however, by early 1943 the Colonial Office resolved to retain Hong Kong after the war.  +
The Colonial Office became particularly optimistic in February 1944 when Li Shu-fan, a prominent Chinese surgeon who had made his way to London, assured the Colonial Office and the Foreign Office that most members of the Chinese upper classes would prefer British rule to Chinese rule after the war.  +
That summer, the Hong Kong Planning Unit was established under Frank Smith, the former colonial secretary.  +
After 1944 the unit was led by David MacDougall, a Hong Kong cadet who had escaped during the Japanese occupation.  +
By mid-1945, Winston Churchill realized that Chiang Kai-shek could not try to recover Hong Kong without support from the United States, which now considered the continuation of the British Empire vital to its own interests in the postwar world.  +
As victory became imminent, in the summer of 1945 the Hong Kong Planning Unit and the China Association, a powerful lobby representing British business interests in China, began to consider various proposals for constitutional reform, among them giving a greater role to local Chinese.  +
Churchill now declared that Hong Kong would be removed from the British Empire “over my dead body.”
然而，随着战局对日本不利，到1943年初，英国殖民部决定战后保留香港。1944年2月，一位前往伦敦的著名华人外科医生李树帆向殖民部和外交部保证，战后大多数华人上层阶级成员会更倾向于英国统治而非中国统治，这令殖民部尤为乐观。同年夏天，在原殖民大臣弗兰克·史密斯的领导下，香港规划组成立。1944年后，该组由在日占时期逃脱的香港学员大卫·麦克杜格尔领导。到1945年中期，温斯顿·丘吉尔意识到，蒋介石若没有美国的支持，根本无法收复香港。此时的美国认为，大英帝国的延续对其自身在战后世界的利益至关重要。随着胜利在望，1945年夏天，香港规划组和代表英国在华商业利益的强大游说团体——中国协会开始考虑各种宪政改革方案，其中包括赋予香港本地华人更大的权力。丘吉尔此时宣称，除非我死了，否则香港绝不会脱离大英帝国。 +
As the British planned for recovering Hong Kong, the problem of what to do with the old business and professional elite arose.  +
The British needed a local support base, but some of the Europeans interned during the war had criticized leaders such as Robert Kotewall and Chow Shouson for being too compliant with the Japanese.  +
Yet the returning colonial government would have great difficulty finding anyone to replace these old leaders.  +
Furthermore, there was the problem of convincing the local Chinese population that Britain, rather than Nationalist China, deserved to rule Hong Kong after the war.  +
This explains both why the British, who could not afford to lose the people they had depended on for so long, decided to keep the old leaders and why these leaders worked so hard to restore British rule.  +
The Colonial Office eventually decided that Chow and Kotewall had been acting in the colony’s best interest.
随着英国人筹划收复香港，如何处置原有的商业和专业精英阶层成了一个难题。英国需要一个本地支持基础，但一些在战争期间被拘禁的欧洲人曾批评罗伯特·科特沃尔和周寿祯等领导人对日本人过于顺从。然而，复辟的殖民政府很难找到人来取代这些老领导人。此外，如何说服当地华人相信英国而非国民党统治下的中国才配在战后统治香港，也是一个难题。这既解释了为什么英国人——他们无法承受失去长期以来赖以生存的民众——决定保留这些老领导人，也解释了为什么这些领导人如此努力地维护英国的统治。最终，殖民部认定周寿祯和科特沃尔的行为符合殖民地的最佳利益。 +
Just as victory against Japan became certain, a more immediate challenge arose.  +
Japan surrendered on August 14, earlier than most British military planners had predicted.  +
American and Nationalist Chinese troops were making progress in China, getting closer by the day to Canton.  +
Knowing that Roosevelt wanted Chiang Kai-shek to accept the Japanese surrender as supreme commander in almost all of the China Theater, the British feared that Chiang’s troops would try to accept the surrender in Hong Kong.  +
Although Chiang assured them that he would not try to retake Hong Kong after accepting the surrender, the British dispatched Rear Admiral Cecil Harcourt from Sydney with a fleet to reach Hong Kong first.  +
When Britain and China asked the United States to help them resolve the matter, Chiang proposed delegating surrender authority to a British official in Hong Kong, but only if Britain agreed not to accept the Japanese surrender until after Chiang had formally accepted the surrender for the China Theater.  +
Britain agreed, and on September 16 Harcourt accepted the Japanese surrender on behalf of Britain and China in the presence of a Chinese and an American official.
正当对日胜利已成定局之际，一个更为紧迫的挑战出现了。日本于8月14日投降，比大多数英国军事策划者的预期都要早。美军和国民党军队在中国境内节节推进，日益逼近广州。英国人知道罗斯福希望蒋介石作为几乎整个中国战区的最高统帅接受日本投降，因此担心蒋介石的部队会在香港试图接受投降。尽管蒋介石向他们保证，接受投降后不会试图夺回香港，但英国还是派遣塞西尔·哈考特海军少将率领舰队从悉尼率军前往香港。当英国和中国请求美国协助解决此事时，蒋介石提议将投降权委托给一位驻港的英国官员，但前提是英国同意在蒋介石正式接受中国战区投降之前，不接受日本的投降。英国同意了，9 月 16 日，哈考特在一名中国官员和一名美国官员的见证下，代表英国和中国接受了日本的投降。 +
This arrangement briefly soured Sino-British relations, but it was as pragmatic as it was symbolic.  +
It also helps explain why Hong Kong remained a British colony after the war.  +
Although there were loud calls in China for recovering Hong Kong and although he had almost sixty thousand troops within three hundred miles of Hong Kong when the Japanese surrendered, Chiang realized that Britain would not give up Hong Kong easily and that a failure to recover Hong Kong would discredit him in China.  +
Furthermore, he needed the support of both the United States and Britain to be a major player in the new world order.  +
Preoccupied with recovering northern China and keeping Chinese Communist troops from recapturing Japanese-held territory, he did not want to provoke the Communists into entering the race for Hong Kong, especially since their East River Column was closer to Hong Kong than were his own troops.  +
Concerned about the postwar order, the United States had now softened its stance toward colonialism.  +
Harry Truman, who became president after Roosevelt died in April 1945, was less committed than his predecessor to restoring Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty, while General Douglas MacArthur, commander of the Allied forces in the Southwest Pacific, supported outright the continuation of the British Empire in East Asia.  +
The British realized that they could not prevent Chiang’s troops from recapturing Hong Kong and that the United States, regardless of its new attitudes toward colonialism, would not help the British resist such an attempt.  +
They also realized that such an arrangement would play out better among the Chinese population of Hong Kong, some of whom, proud of China’s new status, thought that this might be a chance to get rid of the British.
这一安排一度令中英关系恶化，但其务实性和象征意义并存。这也解释了为何战后香港仍是英国殖民地。尽管中国国内要求收复香港的呼声高涨，而且在日本投降时，蒋介石在香港方圆三百英里内驻扎了近六万兵力，但他深知英国不会轻易放弃香港，而若未能收复香港，将使他在中国声望受损。此外，他需要美国和英国的支持才能在新世界秩序中扮演重要角色。蒋介石当时正忙于收复中国北方，并阻止中国共产党军队重新夺回日占领土，因此他不想激怒共产党，使其卷入香港争夺战，尤其考虑到共产党的东江纵队比他的军队更靠近香港。出于对战后秩序的担忧，美国此时已软化了其对殖民主义的立场。哈里·杜鲁门在罗斯福于1945年4月去世后继任总统，他对恢复香港主权的决心远不及前任。而西南太平洋盟军总司令道格拉斯·麦克阿瑟将军则公开支持大英帝国在东亚的延续。英国人意识到他们无法阻止蒋介石的军队重新夺回香港，而且美国即便对殖民主义的态度有所转变，也不会帮助英国抵抗这种企图。他们也意识到，这样的安排或许更有利于香港华人，因为一些华人对中国的新地位感到自豪，认为这或许是摆脱英国统治的机会。 +
REBUILDING HONG KONG  重建香港
Postwar Hong Kong was plagued by the problems that face all societies reeling from the ravages of war: inflation, unemployment, looting, poor health and sanitary conditions, and shortages in currency, housing, personnel, and food (some 80 percent of the population suffered from malnutrition).  +
Compounding these problems was the task of imprisoning and repatriating thousands of Japanese soldiers and civilians.  +
Recovery was not easy, but David MacDougall’s interim military administration, which managed the colony for eight months, did a remarkable job of restoring order by setting price controls, providing emergency food supplies, and restoring the fishing industry.  +
Anne Sorby, who came to work in the interim military administration from the mainland, where she had been stationed with the British Special Operations Executive unit, recalled that “there was a real team spirit between the military, naval and civil....  +
It was all very inspiring.  +
We were determined to make it work, and it did.”12
战后香港饱受战争蹂躏后所有社会都会面临的问题困扰：通货膨胀、失业、抢劫、恶劣的卫生条件以及货币、住房、人员和食品短缺（约 80%的人口营养不良）。雪上加霜的是，还要监禁和遣返数千名日本士兵和平民。重建之路并非坦途，但戴维·麦克杜格尔领导的临时军事行政机构管理香港长达八个月，通过实施价格管制、提供紧急食品供应和恢复渔业，出色地恢复了秩序。安妮·索比曾在英国特别行动执行处驻扎于大陆，之后来到香港加入临时军事行政机构。她回忆说：“军方、海军和文职人员之间有着真正的团队精神……这一切都非常鼓舞人心。我们决心要成功，而我们也做到了。” 12 +
Hong Kong’s recovery could not have been accomplished, however, without an enterprising and resourceful population that, having endured the Japanese occupation for more than three years, was ready to help rebuild Hong Kong.  +
By November 1945, the economy had recovered so well that government controls were lifted and free markets restored.  +
By early 1946 the population had returned to around one million, although this had as much to do with the chaotic conditions in China, which provided a steady influx of immigrants, as with the efforts of the interim government.  +
Trade had returned to almost 60 percent of its prewar level.  +
During the same year, Hong Kong got its own airline, Cathay Pacific, a predominantly British corporation.  +
The economy recovered so quickly that the government enjoyed a budget surplus for the 1947–1948 financial year.  +
Hong Kong’s economy also benefited greatly from the Chinese civil war between the Nationalists and the Communists.  +
Although Hong Kong’s industry had already been reasonably well developed before the war, it was rejuvenated by Chinese entrepreneurs escaping the war.  +
The colonial government later estimated that the infusion of Shanghai capital and business experience gave the colony a ten- to fifteen-year head start over the rest of East Asia.
然而，如果没有香港人民的进取精神和创造力，香港的复苏是不可能实现的。在经历了三年多的日本占领之后，他们随时准备帮助重建香港。到1945年11月，香港经济复苏势头良好，政府解除管制，恢复自由市场。到1946年初，香港人口已回升至约一百万，这既得益于中国当时的混乱局势（持续涌入移民），也得益于过渡政府的努力。贸易额已恢复到战前水平的近60%。同年，香港拥有了自己的航空公司——国泰航空，这是一家以英国人为主的公司。经济复苏如此迅速，以至于政府在1947-1948财政年度实现了财政盈余。香港经济也从国民党和共产党之间的中国内战中获益匪浅。尽管香港的工业在战前已经相当发达，但逃离战火的中国企业家的涌入使其重焕生机。殖民政府后来估计，上海的资本和商业经验的注入，使该殖民地比东亚其他地区领先了 10 到 15 年。 +
When Rear Admiral Harcourt landed at Hong Kong on August 30, observers noted that for every British flag that welcomed him, there were about four Nationalist Chinese flags.  +
Yet even though pro-Chinese sentiment was strong, there was very little overt anti-British sentiment, let alone the type of anticolonial nationalism that developed after the war in other European colonies.  +
The speed of Hong Kong’s postwar recovery helped restore confidence in British rule, especially compared with the suffering during the Japanese occupation and with the political and financial instability in postwar China.  +
Still, many Chinese—and even some Europeans—agreed that some of the old racial barriers had to be removed.  +
Criticism of the many failures of prewar British rule began to proliferate in the local press, as did new and vocal demands for the end of European privilege: the end of discrimination in the workplace, more government positions for non-Europeans, more Chinese representation in government, and the abolition of prohibitions against Chinese living on Victoria Peak and joining the Hong Kong Club.
8月30日，哈考特海军少将抵达香港时，观察人士注意到，迎接他的英国国旗与国民党旗帜的数量几乎相等。尽管亲华情绪高涨，但公开的反英情绪却寥寥无几，更遑论像其他欧洲殖民地战后兴起的那种反殖民民族主义。香港战后迅速复苏，有助于恢复人们对英国统治的信心，尤其与日本占领时期的苦难以及战后中国的政治和经济动荡相比更是如此。尽管如此，许多中国人——甚至一些欧洲人——都认为必须消除一些旧有的种族壁垒。对战前英国统治诸多弊端的批评开始在当地媒体上广泛传播，同时，要求结束欧洲特权的呼声也日益高涨：结束职场歧视，为非欧洲人提供更多政府职位，增加华人在政府中的代表人数，以及取消禁止华人居住在太平山顶和加入香港俱乐部的禁令。 +
Although Hong Kong people naturally demanded retribution against their Japanese abusers and the Chinese and Eurasians who had helped them, Hong Kong’s wartime experience never led to the type of bitter recrimination against collaborators that occurred in China and in Europe.  +
For helping the Japanese, some Indian police and prison wardens were sent back to India, and Sikhs were never again recruited for the police force.  +
For the most part, however, the British again found themselves relying on the same people they had counted on before the war.  +
In October 1945, Robert Kotewall was asked to withdraw from public life until his wartime record could be fully cleared.  +
When the colonial civil government was restored the following May, he had to resign his seat on the Executive Council.  +
Kotewall was never allowed to return to public life, Chow Shouson never completely returned, and Li Tse-fong was not reappointed to the Legislative Council.  +
However, the Eurasian Lo Man Kam was able to return to public life because the British believed that he had worked with the Japanese only with great reluctance.  +
(In contrast to his years on the colonial Legislative Council, Lo generally remained silent on the wartime councils.  +
One of the only occasions he spoke was when, asked by the Japanese authorities how they might improve relations between Chinese and Japanese, he replied that the Japanese troops might take the initiative by not relieving themselves in public.) Lo was appointed in 1946 to the Executive Council, where he played a large role, and was subsequently knighted in 1948 for helping to rebuild Hong Kong.  +
Chau Tsun Nin, a prominent lawyer and businessman who had avoided collaborating by taking refuge in neutral Macau, was also appointed to the Legislative and Executive Councils and was made Commander of the British Empire.
尽管香港民众自然要求对日本侵略者以及曾帮助他们的华裔和欧亚裔人士进行报复，但香港的战时经历并未像中国和欧洲那样，引发对合作者的强烈谴责。一些印度裔警察和狱卒因协助日军而被遣返回印度，锡克教徒也再未被招募加入警队。然而，在很大程度上，英国人发现自己仍然依赖于战前就已倚重的那些人。1945年10月，罗伯特·科特沃尔被要求退出政坛，直至其战时记录完全洗清。次年5月殖民地民政政府复辟后，他被迫辞去行政会议议员的职务。科特沃尔此后一直未能重返政坛，周寿璠也未能完全恢复政治生涯，李泽峰也未能再次被任命为立法会议员。然而，欧亚混血的罗文锦得以重返政坛，是因为英国人认为他与日本人合作是极不情愿的。（与他在殖民地立法会任职期间不同，罗文锦在战时议会中通常保持沉默。他为数不多的发言之一是，当日本当局询问他如何改善中日关系时，他回答说，日本军队可以主动采取措施，例如不在公共场所小便。）1946年，罗文锦被任命为行政会议成员，并在其中发挥了重要作用，随后于1948年因协助重建香港而被授予爵士头衔。 周俊年是一位杰出的律师和商人，他通过躲在中立的澳门避免与当局合作，也被任命为立法会和行政会议员，并被授予大英帝国司令勋章。 +
Nor did Hong Kong witness the spectacle and trauma associated with the war crimes trials conducted in Europe and in other parts of Asia.  +
Only 21 of the 129 Japanese accused of war crimes and tried in Hong Kong were executed.  +
Lieutenant General Sakai, who had led the invasion in December 1941, was captured in mainland China and executed in Nanjing.  +
Lieutenant General Tanaka Hisakazu, governor of Hong Kong in 1945, was also captured on the mainland and was then tried and executed in Canton.  +
But Governor Isogai Rensuke, who was also tried in Nanjing, served only five years of his life sentence.  +
Nor did the Japanese occupation create the kind of anti-Japanese sentiments that persist to this day in mainland China.  +
Indeed, Japanese businessmen returned quite quickly in the late 1940s, although under the control of American occupation forces.
香港也没有像欧洲和亚洲其他地区那样，经历战争罪行审判带来的惨烈场面和创伤。在香港受审的129名被控犯有战争罪行的日本人中，只有21人被处决。1941年12月入侵香港的日本中将酒井中将，在中国大陆被捕后于南京被处决。1945年担任香港总督的田中久和中将，也在中国大陆被捕，随后在广州受审并被处决。而同样在南京受审的香港总督矶贝廉介，仅服刑五年便获释。日本占领时期也没有在中国大陆造成至今仍然存在的反日情绪。事实上，尽管当时处于美军占领之下，日本商人还是在20世纪40年代末期迅速返回香港。 +
POSTWAR CHANGES AND THE YOUNG PLAN
战后变革与青年计划
The return of Governor Mark Young on May 1, 1946, to the colony that he had surrendered in December 1941 was a symbolic move, designed to emphasize that the Japanese occupation had been only a temporary disruption.  +
But Young quickly showed that he had no desire to set back the clock.  +
Instead, he proposed the most radical constitutional reforms in Hong Kong’s history.  +
Young believed that the Chinese of Hong Kong needed more political representation to increase their desire to remain under British rule.  +
Convinced that Hong Kong might eventually become a city-state within the British Empire and Commonwealth, Young called for greater Chinese membership in the Legislative and Executive Councils.  +
He proposed a municipal council, of which two-thirds would be elected mainly by Chinese voters, while letting the colonial government retain control of finance and defense.  +
Young also called for more localization by replacing European government officials with Chinese.  +
Although Young based his plan on the recent constitutional reforms elsewhere in the empire, he was also drawing on an old lesson that the British had learned from the American Revolution and applied to their white subjects in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa: cultivate an imperial identity by giving colonial subjects more of a say in government.
1946年5月1日，杨明哲总督重返他于1941年12月交出的殖民地，这一举动具有象征意义，旨在强调日本的占领只是暂时的干扰。但杨明哲很快表明，他无意让历史倒退。相反，他提出了香港历史上最激进的宪政改革。杨明哲认为，香港华人需要更多的政治代表权，以增强他们留在英国统治下的意愿。他坚信香港最终可能成为大英帝国和英联邦内的一个城邦，因此呼吁增加华人在立法会和行政会中的席位。他提议设立一个市政委员会，其中三分之二的席位主要由华人选民选举产生，同时保留殖民地政府对财政和国防的控制权。杨明哲还呼吁通过用华人取代欧洲政府官员来实现更多本土化。尽管杨格的计划是基于帝国其他地区最近的宪政改革，但他同时也借鉴了英国从美国革命中吸取的一个古老教训，并将其应用于他们在澳大利亚、加拿大、新西兰和南非的白人臣民：通过赋予殖民地臣民更多政府发言权来培养帝国认同感。 +
Although in July 1947 the British government publicly approved the Young plan in principle, the reforms were doomed from the start.  +
The British government soon sent Alexander Grantham to replace Young, whom it worried was too closely associated with the surrender to the Japanese.  +
Unlike Young, Grantham, who had been in Hong Kong as a cadet during the strike-boycott of 1925–1926, believed that the colony’s proximity to China meant that local Chinese could never be molded into loyal British subjects.  +
Grantham agreed that the Legislative Council could be made slightly more representative, but he doubted that Hong Kong could ever have the kind of system that had developed during his governorship in Jamaica, Nigeria, and Fiji.  +
“Hong Kong is different from other colonies,” he later wrote, “for Hong Kong can never become independent.  +
Either it remains a British colony, or it is re-absorbed into China as part of the province of Kwangtung [Guangdong].” 13 Nor, Grantham insisted, were Young’s reforms even necessary.  +
Grantham, who enjoyed good relations with the British and Chinese merchants of Hong Kong as well as with prominent military and political officials in China, believed that the majority of Hong Kong Chinese preferred British rule and that the British could prevent the Nationalists from trying to recover Hong Kong.  +
He was less optimistic that the British could do the same if the Communists took control of China, but he felt certain that the Communists would not bother Hong Kong as long as they were convinced of the colony’s value to them.
尽管英国政府在 1947 年 7 月公开原则上批准了杨氏改革方案，但这些改革从一开始就注定失败。英国政府很快派遣亚历山大·格兰瑟姆接替杨氏，因为他们担心杨氏与向日本投降的关系过于密切。与杨氏不同，格兰瑟姆曾在 1925-1926 年的罢工抵制运动期间以学员身份在香港待过，他认为香港与中国大陆的地理位置意味着当地华人永远无法被塑造成忠诚的英国臣民。格兰瑟姆同意立法会可以略微提高代表性，但他怀疑香港是否能够建立起像他在牙买加、尼日利亚和斐济担任总督期间所建立的那种制度。“香港与其他殖民地不同，”他后来写道，“因为香港永远不可能独立。它要么继续作为英国殖民地，要么作为广东省的一部分重新并入中国。” 13 格兰瑟姆还坚持认为，杨氏的改革根本没有必要。格兰瑟姆与香港的英国和中国商人以及中国的一些重要军政官员都保持着良好的关系。他认为，大多数香港华人更倾向于英国的统治，而且英国能够阻止国民党试图收复香港。如果共产党控制了中国，他不太乐观英国能否做到这一点，但他确信，只要共产党确信香港对他们有价值，他们就不会干涉香港事务。 +
The failure of the Young plan cannot, however, be blamed solely on Grantham.  +
Although the new governor was greatly responsible for killing the reforms, they were also hurt by a lack of support from the British government and from Hong Kong’s Chinese and expatriate business communities as well as by the changing political situation in China.  +
While the Colonial Office generally supported Young’s plan, the Foreign Office worried that introducing democracy would provoke the Chinese government (whether Nationalist or Communist), as would any plans to keep Hong Kong in the British Empire and Commonwealth.  +
Some Hong Kong officials saw the reforms as a threat to their executive authority.  +
Both British and Chinese civil servants and business leaders were afraid that the reforms would enable Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalists to influence local municipal politics.  +
The influx of refugees during the civil war also hurt the plans, because these refugees were more concerned about their immediate livelihood than about constitutional reform.  +
Eager to escape Communist rule, the wave of Chinese refugees who came after the 1949 revolution had even fewer grudges against the colonial government.
然而，杨氏改革计划的失败不能完全归咎于格兰瑟姆。尽管这位新任总督对改革的失败负有主要责任，但英国政府、香港华人及外籍商界人士缺乏支持，以及中国政治局势的变化，也对改革造成了不利影响。殖民地事务部总体上支持杨氏的计划，但外交部担心，引入民主制度会激怒中国政府（无论是国民党还是共产党），任何将香港留在英联邦的计划也会如此。一些香港官员将改革视为对其行政权力的威胁。英国和中国的公务员及商界领袖都担心，改革会使蒋介石的国民党能够影响地方政治。内战期间涌入的难民也对改革计划造成了阻碍，因为这些难民更关心的是眼前的生计，而不是宪政改革。1949年革命后涌入的中国难民急于逃离共产党的统治，他们对殖民地政府的怨恨甚至更少。 +
The British government’s earlier concerns about placating any demands for reform in Hong Kong soon subsided.  +
In December 1948 and again in August 1949, the Labour government, which earlier had declared its commitment to decolonizing the British Empire, affirmed its intention to keep Hong Kong.  +
In June 1949 the predominantly expatriate Hong Kong Reform Club and Kowloon Chamber of Commerce petitioned Grantham for a directly elected Legislative Council, and in July almost 150 Chinese groups, including the Chinese Manufacturers’ Union, the Hong Kong Chinese Reform Association, and the Kowloon Chinese Chamber of Commerce, petitioned Grantham for constitutional reforms at the central and municipal levels.  +
After the Communist victory in 1949 and China’s subsequent entry into the Korean War in 1950, however, the Foreign Office feared that political reforms would provoke China (as a similar proposal for reform in Gibraltar had provoked Spain).
英国政府早先对安抚香港任何改革诉求的担忧很快消散。1948年12月和1949年8月，此前曾宣布致力于英国殖民帝国非殖民化的工党政府重申了保留香港的意图。1949年6月，主要由外籍人士组成的香港改革俱乐部和九龙商会向格兰瑟姆请愿，要求设立直选立法会；同年7月，包括中国制造业联合会、香港华人改革协会和九龙中华商会在内的近150个华人团体向格兰瑟姆请愿，要求在中央和地方层面进行宪政改革。然而，在1949年共产党取得胜利以及中国随后于1950年卷入朝鲜战争之后，英国外交部担心政治改革会激怒中国（正如在直布罗陀提出的类似改革方案激怒了西班牙一样）。 +
The Foreign Office approved Grantham’s less radical reforms in May 1952, but unofficial members of the legislative and executive councils suddenly opposed any reforms.  +
Four months later, the British cabinet agreed to scrap plans for constitutional reform in Hong Kong.  +
In October, Secretary for the Colonies Oliver Lyttelton told the House of Commons that any constitutional reforms would be confined to the Urban Council and that any significant reform would be “inopportune.” Robert Black, who succeeded Grantham as governor in 1958, was also convinced that any political reforms would provoke China.  +
Although historian Steve Tsang has found that none of the declassified British documents for the 1950s and 1960s indicate that leaders of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) ever warned the Hong Kong government against any political reforms, British officials frequently used the argument that any democratic reforms would not be tolerated by China to justify Hong Kong’s lack of democratization.14 Thus, writes Leo Goodstadt, who has spent several decades working in and writing on Hong Kong, “an expatriate colonial administration, in collusion with a largely Chinese business elite, frustrated the modest reforms proposed for the territory and ensured the survival of colonial political institutions inherited from the previous century.”15
1952 年 5 月，英国外交部批准了格兰瑟姆较为温和的改革方案，但立法会和行政会的非正式成员突然反对任何改革。四个月后，英国政府同意放弃香港宪政改革计划。同年 10 月，殖民地事务大臣利特尔顿在下议院表示，任何宪政改革都将仅限于市政委员会，任何重大改革都“不合时宜”。1958 年接替格兰瑟姆出任香港总督的罗伯特·布莱克也坚信，任何政治改革都会激怒中国。尽管历史学家曾志伟发现，在 20 世纪 50 年代和 60 年代解密的英国文件中，没有任何证据表明中华人民共和国领导人曾警告香港政府不要进行任何政治改革，但英国官员经常以中国不会容忍任何民主改革为由，为香港缺乏民主化进程辩护。 14 因此，正如在香港工作和写作数十年的利奥·古德斯塔特所写，“一个外籍殖民政府与主要由华人组成的商业精英勾结，阻挠了为香港提出的温和改革方案，并确保了从上个世纪继承而来的殖民政治制度的延续。” 15 +
The early postwar years nevertheless saw some important changes.  +
Ironically, part of the impulse for these changes came from the Japanese, who in their wartime propaganda had drawn unflattering attention to Hong Kong’s problems, most prominently its racial discrimination and legalized opium smoking.  +
“The conquest of December 1941,” writes Snow, “had given the old colonial rulers a sort of enforced sabbatical in which to sit back and take stock of their pre-war deficiencies.”16 While some of the old colonials did not necessarily share what became known as “the 1946 outlook,” both British government officials and local colonial administrators realized that Hong Kong needed at least minor constitutional changes and that the colony could not return to the prewar days of racial discrimination.  +
Some of these sentiments came from administrators who, like MacDougall and Young, saw British colonialism as an important step toward self-rule.  +
The impulse for change also had a strong pragmatic basis: the British realized that they needed to win over the local Chinese to legitimize and maintain their continued rule in Hong Kong.
尽管如此，战后初期还是出现了一些重要的变化。具有讽刺意味的是，这些变化的部分推动力来自日本人。他们在战时宣传中对香港的问题进行了毫不留情的抨击，其中最突出的是种族歧视和鸦片合法化。斯诺写道：“1941 年 12 月的征服给了昔日的殖民统治者一段被迫的休整期，让他们得以反思战前的种种不足。” 16 虽然一些昔日的殖民者未必认同后来被称为“1946 年展望”的观点，但英国政府官员和当地殖民地官员都意识到，香港至少需要进行一些小的宪政改革，而且殖民地不能再回到战前种族歧视的时代。其中一些观点来自像麦克杜格尔和杨这样的官员，他们将英国的殖民统治视为迈向自治的重要一步。变革的动力也源于强烈的务实考量：英国人意识到，他们需要赢得当地华人的支持，才能使其在香港的统治合法化并维持下去。 +
In late July 1946, shortly after Young’s return, the colonial government repealed the 1904 and 1918 Peak ordinances as well as the ordinance that had reserved part of the island of Cheung Chau for Europeans.  +
Soon wealthy Chinese were moving to the Peak.  +
Racial discrimination was suddenly seen as being out of step with the times.  +
Grantham observed a “marked decline in social snobbishness” and a “greater mixing of the races” compared to when he had been in Hong Kong during the 1920s and 1930s.17 Whereas visitors from other colonies before the war had frequently commented on the width of the racial divide in Hong Kong, visitors after the war were often surprised to see both Chinese and foreigners using buses and trams.  +
In October, Paul Tsui, the University of Hong Kong graduate who had worked for the BAAG during the war, became the first Chinese cadet officer.  +
The government also banned opium smoking and tripled the minimum daily wage.  +
The Executive Council was expanded to include an equal number of Chinese and European unofficial members.
1946 年 7 月下旬，杨荣文回国后不久，殖民地政府废除了 1904 年和 1918 年的山顶法令，以及将长洲岛部分地区划为欧洲人居住地的法令。很快，富裕的华人开始迁往山顶。种族歧视突然被视为与时代格格不入。格兰瑟姆观察到，与他 20 世纪 20 年代和 30 年代在香港时相比，“社会势利眼现象显著减少”，“种族融合程度更高”。 17 战前，来自其他殖民地的游客经常评论香港种族隔离的严重程度，而战后，游客常常惊讶地发现华人和外国人都在乘坐公共汽车和电车。10 月，曾在战时为英国陆军总参谋部工作的香港大学毕业生徐保罗成为首位华人学员军官。政府还禁止吸食鸦片，并将最低日工资提高到原来的三倍。执行委员会扩大了成员规模，中国和欧洲的非正式成员人数相等。 +
Yet the magnitude of these changes should not be exaggerated.  +
Many elite clubs remained closed to Chinese and Europeans until the late 1950s.  +
The most important government and commercial positions were still held by Europeans, and the expatriate-dominated Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce did not get a Chinese chair until the 1980s.  +
The plans for localization made little headway.  +
Instead, government positions were filled with “retreads,” expatriate colonial officers brought in from other British colonies.  +
Although many of these new officers were more liberal than the old colonials, the temporary solidarity that had been forged during the war slipped away.  +
Expatriate officials enjoyed higher wages and better terms of employment and promotion as well as superior housing and medical care.  +
Many colonial officials had always doubted the loyalty of the Hong Kong Chinese, but these doubts intensified after the Chinese revolution of 1949, when, writes Goodstadt, “Chinese were viewed as more susceptible to ideological conversion than the English (despite the Soviet spy scandals in the British Foreign Office).”18 As Chinese refugees flooded in while the civil war escalated, the local demands for reform subsided.  +
Thus, the British could afford to become more confident in retaining Hong Kong without making any significant changes.
然而，这些变化的程度不应被夸大。许多精英俱乐部直到 20 世纪 50 年代末才对华人和欧洲人开放。最重要的政府和商业职位仍然由欧洲人把持，而由外籍人士主导的香港总商会直到 20 世纪 80 年代才设立华人主席。本土化计划进展甚微。相反，政府职位被大量“老兵”填补，这些“老兵”是从其他英国殖民地调来的外籍殖民官员。尽管许多新官员比老殖民者更加开明，但战争期间建立的临时团结却逐渐消逝。外籍官员享有更高的工资、更好的工作和晋升条件，以及更优越的住房和医疗条件。许多殖民官员一直怀疑香港华人的忠诚度，但这种怀疑在 1949 年中国革命后加剧。正如古德斯塔特所写，“华人被认为比英国人更容易接受意识形态转变（尽管英国外交部曾爆出苏联间谍丑闻）。” 18 随着内战升级，大量中国难民涌入，当地民众对改革的呼声逐渐减弱。因此，英国人得以更加自信地维持对香港的控制，而无需做出任何重大改变。 +
In the end, the greatest significance of World War II for Hong Kong was probably economic rather than social or political.  +
On the one hand, the British never regained their prewar hold on Hong Kong’s economy.  +
It was the Chinese who, for example, literally rebuilt Hong Kong: in 1946 all of the contractors used by the Public Works Department to rebuild the colony were Chinese.  +
It was also the Chinese who rebuilt the light-industry base they had established before the war.  +
From 1947 to 1949, almost all major firms in Shanghai moved their operations to Hong Kong, which gave the colony larger and more sophisticated factories.  +
Together, local industrialists and these “emigrant entrepreneurs” from Shanghai, as sociologist Wong Siu-lun calls them, built on Hong Kong’s earlier industrial base, which had been established in the early 1900s and expanded in the late 1930s when Chinese industrialists had moved to Hong Kong after the Japanese invasion of China.19
最终，二战对香港最大的影响或许在于经济层面，而非社会或政治层面。一方面，英国再也无法恢复战前对香港经济的控制。例如，正是中国人重建了香港：1946 年，公​​共工程署所有负责重建香港的承包商都是中国人。同样，也是中国人重建了他们在战前建立的轻工业基地。1947 年至 1949 年间，上海几乎所有大型企业都将业务迁至香港，这使得香港拥有了规模更大、技术更先进的工厂。正如社会学家黄兆伦所言，本地实业家和这些来自上海的“移民企业家”共同巩固了香港早期的工业基础。香港的工业基础建立于 20 世纪初，并在 20 世纪 30 年代末日本侵华后，随着中国实业家迁往香港而得到扩展。 +
On the other hand, whereas some British leaders had doubted Hong Kong’s economic value, the war helped make Hong Kong an even more important part of the shrinking British Empire.  +
Because the abolition of the foreign concessions in China following the war threatened the economic security that foreigners had enjoyed for so long, many foreign firms soon moved their headquarters from China to Hong Kong.  +
Hong Kong thus became of greater strategic importance than before as the center of British commercial operations in China.  +
With an insurgency in Malaya led by Chinese Communists and the impending Communist victory in China, holding on to Hong Kong also became of great psychological importance.  +
Losing the colony would hurt British prestige and undermine the struggle against Communism in Thailand, Burma, and Malaya.  +
This strategic usefulness was enhanced by the fact that the cost of retaining Hong Kong was extremely low.  +
After 1948, Hong Kong did not require any financial assistance from Britain, although Britain continued to pay for most of the local garrison.
另一方面，尽管一些英国领导人曾对香港的经济价值持怀疑态度，但战争却使香港在日渐萎缩的大英帝国中扮演了更为重要的角色。由于战后中国取消外国租界威胁到外国人长期以来享有的经济安全，许多外国公司很快将总部从中国大陆迁至香港。因此，香港作为英国在华商业活动的中心，其战略重要性比以往任何时候都更加凸显。随着中国共产党在马来亚发动叛乱，以及共产党即将在中国取得胜利，守住香港也具有重要的心理意义。失去这片殖民地将损害英国的威望，并削弱其在泰国、缅甸和马来亚的反共斗争。而维持香港统治的成本极低，更凸显了香港的战略价值。1948年后，香港不再需要英国的任何财政援助，尽管英国仍然承担着大部分驻港部队的费用。 +
HONG KONG AND THE CHINESE REVOLUTION OF 1949
香港与1949年中国革命
The reactions in Britain and Hong Kong to the establishment of the PRC in October 1949 were a mixture of anxiety and relief.  +
Most Chinese in Hong Kong were simply glad for the civil war to be over.  +
Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang regime, which reestablished the Republic of China on the island of Taiwan, had lost all credibility (although pro-Chiang newspapers in Hong Kong now called for the colony to be restored to the Republic of China).  +
The new PRC government did not seem to directly threaten British commercial interests in China, nor had the Chinese Communists ever cared about recovering Hong Kong.  +
Chairman Mao Zedong, who once referred to Hong Kong as “that wasteland of an island,” reportedly told a British journalist in 1946 that neither he nor the CCP was interested in Hong Kong and that as long as the British did not mistreat Chinese in Hong Kong, he would not let the status of Hong Kong harm Sino-British relations.  +
In November 1948, Qiao Mu, head of the local branch of the CCP’s New China News Agency, assured the Hong Kong government that a new Communist government would not bother Hong Kong and that it would even allow the colonial government to provide refuge to Nationalist leaders.
1949年10月中华人民共和国成立后，英国和香港的反应既焦虑又如释重负。香港的大多数华人只是庆幸内战终于结束。蒋介石的国民党政权在台湾岛重建了中华民国，但其信誉已荡然无存（尽管香港亲蒋报纸当时呼吁将香港归还中华民国）。新成立的中华民国政府似乎并未直接威胁到英国在中国的商业利益，而中国共产党也从未真正关心过香港的收复。毛泽东主席曾称香港为“那座荒岛”，据报道，他在1946年告诉一位英国记者，他和中国共产党都对香港不感兴趣，只要英国不虐待香港华人，他就不会让香港的地位损害中英关系。 1948年11月，中共新华社香港分社社长乔木向香港政府保证，新的共产党政府不会骚扰香港，甚至会允许殖民政府为国民党领导人提供庇护。 +
Still, the months leading up to the Communist victory had been tense for Sino-British relations and for both the government and the population of Hong Kong.  +
In April 1949, Communist batteries in the lower reaches of the Yangzi River shelled a British warship, HMS Amethyst, killing the ship’s captain.  +
The Amethyst escaped to Hong Kong, where the British community greeted its crew members as heroes and the British press portrayed the escape in gallant terms, but the incident humiliated both the Royal Navy and Britain.  +
Although they doubted that the Communists would try to attack Hong Kong, the British government began to reinforce Hong Kong’s garrison, while the Hong Kong government cracked down on local Communist activities by detaining left-wing journalists and breaking up Communist-run groups.  +
In August 1949, the Legislative Council passed special public security legislation that gave the governor wide powers of censorship and included measures reminiscent of those passed during the Second Opium War: requiring identification cards for all residents over twelve years of age and granting the police wide powers to search private residences and to arrest and deport “undesirables.” Although Communist troops stopped at the Hong Kong border on October 17, 1949, after arriving in Canton two days earlier, to many in Hong Kong it had seemed a very close call.
尽管如此，在共产党取得胜利前的几个月里，中英关系以及香港政府和民众都处于紧张状态。1949 年 4 月，长江下游的共产党炮兵炮击了英国军舰“ 紫水晶 ”号，舰长阵亡。 “紫水晶”号逃往香港，英国侨民将船员们奉为英雄，英国媒体也对这次逃亡进行了英勇的报道，但这一事件令英国皇家海军和英国蒙羞。尽管英国政府怀疑共产党不会进攻香港，但他们还是开始加强香港的驻军，而香港政府则通过拘留左翼记者和解散共产党控制的团体来镇压当地的共产党活动。 1949 年 8 月，立法会通过了特别的公共安全法，赋予总督广泛的审查权，其中包括一些与第二次鸦片战争期间通过的法案类似的措施：要求所有 12 岁以上的居民佩戴身份证，并赋予警方广泛的权力，可以搜查私人住宅，逮捕并驱逐“不受欢迎的人”。尽管共产党军队在 1949 年 10 月 17 日抵达香港边境后，于两天前抵达广州，但对许多香港人来说，这似乎是一次非常惊险的局面。 +
Given that the Communist government of China was dedicated to ending colonialism and imperialism worldwide, why did it tolerate British colonialism in its own backyard? Especially compared with the dramatic and often cataclysmic changes that characterized the first decades of the PRC, the new government’s policy toward Hong Kong remained consistently levelheaded and sophisticated.  +
Hong Kong had in fact been an important base for the Communist movement throughout the Chinese civil war.  +
In 1947, the CCP established its Central Hong Kong Bureau (renamed the Central South China Bureau in early 1949).  +
Through the New China News Agency, the CCP spread propaganda within Hong Kong, in China, and among overseas Chinese communities.  +
The CCP trained cadres in the safety of colonial Hong Kong and made an “organized and consistent effort” to recruit members from local schools and factories.20 When the Communists marched toward victory in 1949, they were more concerned with gaining control of northern China.  +
The Communists reassured the British that they would not try to recover Hong Kong after they took power and ordered their troops not to cause too much trouble as they approached the Hong Kong border.
鉴于中国共产党政府致力于在全球范围内终结殖民主义和帝国主义，为何却容忍英国在其后院的殖民统治？尤其与中华人民共和国成立初期几十年间剧烈且往往是灾难性的变革相比，新政府对香港的政策始终保持着冷静和老练。事实上，在整个中国内战期间，香港一直是共产党运动的重要基地。1947 年，中共设立了香港中央局（1949 年初更名为华南中央局）。中共通过新华社在香港、中国大陆以及海外华人社区传播宣传。中共在殖民地香港的安全环境下训练干部，并“有组织、持续地”从当地学校和工厂招募党员 。20 当共产党在 1949 年走向胜利时，他们更关注的是控制中国北方。共产党人向英国人保证，他们夺取政权后不会试图收复香港，并命令军队在接近香港边境时不要制造太多麻烦。 +
The Communists’ policy toward Hong Kong after their victory in the civil war was equally pragmatic.  +
As Steve Tsang puts it, for the PRC government the Hong Kong issue was “somewhere between foreign policy and domestic policy.”21 Because the British had obtained Hong Kong through the first of the unequal treaties (which the PRC government quickly renounced), Hong Kong was an internal Chinese matter that would eventually be resolved peacefully through diplomacy.  +
Encouraging nationalism in a colony full of anti-Communist refugees would be at best futile and at worst foolhardy, perhaps even pushing local Chinese toward Chiang Kai-shek’s regime on Taiwan.  +
(Governor Grantham recalled that the PRC government had a hard time agitating Chinese refugees in Hong Kong, “for the refugees had fled from the communist paradise, and had no love for the government of China.”)22 Even more dangerous, other powers—and the United Nations—might intervene if the Communists tried to foment any anticolonial struggles in Hong Kong.  +
The colony could be of great use to China, just as it had been for more than a century, as a window to the outside world.  +
Remittances from overseas Chinese would provide valuable foreign exchange to help rebuild China’s war-torn economy, while the colony would be a base for importing goods that China could not produce.
共产党在内战胜利后对香港的政策同样务实。正如曾志伟所言，对中华人民共和国政府而言，香港问题“介于外交政策和内政政策之间”。 21 由于英国是通过第一份不平等条约（中华人民共和国政府很快便废除了该条约）获得香港的，因此香港问题属于中国内政，最终将通过外交途径和平解决。在一个充斥着反共难民的殖民地煽动民族主义，充其量是徒劳的，最坏的情况则是愚蠢的，甚至可能将当地华人推向蒋介石在台湾的政权。（格兰瑟姆总督回忆说，中华人民共和国政府很难煽动香港的中国难民，“因为这些难民逃离了共产主义的天堂，对中国政府毫无好感。”） 22 更危险的是，如果共产党试图在香港煽动任何反殖民斗争，其他列强——以及联合国——都可能介入。这片殖民地对中国来说可能大有裨益，就像过去一个多世纪以来一样，它一直是中国了解外部世界的窗口。海外华人的汇款将为中国重建饱受战争蹂躏的经济提供宝贵的外汇，同时，这片殖民地还可以成为进口中国无法生产的商品的基地。 +
The Chinese government also realized that Hong Kong might be used to push Britain and the United States apart from each other vis-à-vis their policy in East Asia.  +
Shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War, Premier Zhou Enlai ordered Huang Zuomei, head of the New China News Agency in Hong Kong, to obey the CCP’s policy of leaving Hong Kong alone, reminding Huang of Hong Kong’s use in overcoming the U.S.  +
and United Nations embargoes and dividing Britain and the United States in their China policies.  +
In 1951, Politburo member Peng Zhen explained that taking Hong Kong would be too difficult and would cause problems in China’s international relations.  +
Instead, Peng argued, it would be better to maintain Hong Kong’s status quo and to use the colony for rebuilding China’s economy.  +
It would be “unwise for us to deal with the problem of Hong Kong rashly and without preparation.”23
中国政府也意识到，香港问题可能被用来离间英国和美国在东亚政策上的立场。朝鲜战争爆发后不久，周恩来总理命令新华社驻香港社长黄作梅遵守中共关于香港不干涉的政策，并提醒黄作梅，香港曾被用来突破美国和联合国的禁运，以及在对华政策上离间英美两国。1951 年，政治局委员彭真解释说，吞并香港难度太大，会给中国的国际关系带来问题。彭真认为，最好维持香港现状，利用这片殖民地重建中国经济。“贸然、不加准备地处理香港问题是不明智的。” 23 +
This does not, however, mean that the relationship between Hong Kong and the new China was always a smooth one.  +
Shortly after closing the border with Hong Kong, Guangdong authorities placed loudspeakers at Lo Wu and Man Kam To (the two main crossing points), blasting criticism at the British and Hong Kong governments.  +
PRC border guards taunted their Hong Kong counterparts, threatening to harm their families once the PRC liberated Hong Kong.  +
Colonial authorities worried that the pro-Beijing schools were training students for subversive activities.  +
Formed in the 1950s as part of the Hong Kong police force, the Special Branch kept a close watch on subversive elements in Hong Kong.  +
A failed tramway strike in Hong Kong during December 1949, provoked by authorities in Canton, showed that the new PRC was a force to reckon with.  +
After a fire in November 1951 left some ten thousand people homeless, in March 1952 a violent confrontation occurred between the colonial police and protesting crowds after a comfort mission from Canton was stopped at the border.  +
One protester was shot dead, more than one hundred were arrested, and twelve were deported.  +
After local left-wing newspapers tried to stir up anti-British feelings and some ten thousand sympathizers protested the shooting, the government shut down for six months the pro-Beijing newspaper Ta Kung Pao, which had reprinted an article from the People’s Daily (the CCP’s main national newspaper) criticizing the Hong Kong government.  +
In September 1953, Chinese shore batteries fired on a Royal Navy launch on antismuggling patrol in international waters, killing seven and wounding five servicemen.
然而，这并不意味着香港与新中国的关系始终一帆风顺。广东当局在关闭香港边境后不久，便在罗湖和文锦渡（两个主要过境点）架设高音喇叭，猛烈抨击英国和香港政府。中华人民共和国边防人员嘲讽香港同行，威胁说一旦中华人民共和国解放香港，就要伤害他们的家人。殖民当局担心亲北京的学校会训练学生从事颠覆活动。成立于 20 世纪 50 年代的香港警队特别部门密切监视着香港的颠覆分子。1949 年 12 月，由广州当局挑起的香港电车罢工失败，表明新中华人民共和国是一股不可忽视的力量。 1951 年 11 月的一场大火导致约一万人无家可归。1952 年 3 月，一支来自广州的慰安妇在边境被拦截，殖民地警察与抗议人群发生激烈冲突。一名抗议者被枪杀，一百多人被捕，十二人被驱逐出境。当地左翼报纸试图煽动反英情绪，约一万名同情者抗议枪击事件后，政府查封了亲北京的 《大公报》六个月。《大公报》 曾转载了《 人民日报》 （中共主要全国性报纸）一篇批评香港政府的文章。1953 年 9 月，中国岸炮向一艘在国际水域执行反走私巡逻任务的英国皇家海军舰艇开火，造成七名军人死亡，五人受伤。 +
Such heated incidents, however, were relatively rare.  +
Because Hong Kong depended on PRC goodwill, not to mention food and water from China (the Guangdong government had originally offered to supply Hong Kong with water for free, but the colonial government, worried that it might be used for propaganda, declined the offer), to survive, the colonial government learned to forge a working relationship with the new government across the border.  +
In December 1948, the British Foreign Office had warned that if the Communists won the civil war, Hong Kong would be like “living on the edge of a volcano.”24 Grantham recalled a rather less alarming image of Hong Kong’s position at the edge of the PRC.  +
“The attitude of the Chinese authorities towards Hong Kong was a combination of passive hostility with occasional outbursts of active unfriendliness: rather like a pot on the kitchen stove; the pot being Hong Kong.  +
Normally the pot would be kept at the back of the stove gently simmering, but every now and then the cook—the Chinese government—would bring it to the front of the stove when it would boil fiercely.  +
After a while he would move it to the back of the stove again.  +
We never knew when the pot was going to be brought to the boil.”25
然而，此类激烈冲突相对罕见。由于香港的生存依赖于中华人民共和国的善意，更不用说来自中国的粮食和水源（广东省政府最初曾提出免费向香港供水，但殖民政府担心这会被用于宣传，因此拒绝了这一提议），殖民政府学会了与邻国的新政府建立工作关系。1948 年 12 月，英国外交部曾警告说，如果共产党赢得内战，香港将如同“生活在火山边缘”。 24 格兰瑟姆回忆起一幅香港位于中华人民共和国边缘的景象，与此相比，则显得不那么令人担忧。 “中国当局对香港的态度是消极敌对与偶尔爆发的敌意相结合：就像厨房炉灶上的一口锅，而这口锅就是香港。通常情况下，这口锅会放在炉灶后方，小火慢炖；但偶尔，厨师——也就是中国政府——会把它放到炉灶前方，让它沸腾起来。过一会儿，他又会把它放回炉灶后方。我们永远不知道这口锅什么时候会沸腾。” 25 +
