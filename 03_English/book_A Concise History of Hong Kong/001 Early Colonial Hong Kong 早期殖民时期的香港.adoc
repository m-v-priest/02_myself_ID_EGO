-> From French plutonique ‎(“of or pertaining to #Pluto#(冥王星；冥王), the underworld, interior of the Earth”)

.a “borrowed place living on borrowed time”
“A borrowed place living on borrowed time” 这句话常被用来形容香港在殖民时期的特殊地位，其含义可从两个层面理解：

- **“借来的地方”：指香港（尤指香港岛）是英国通过《南京条约》（1842年）从清政府手中“借用”或割占的领土，**其统治权并非基于历史或自然延续，而是依托殖民条约建立的临时性安排。
- **“借来的时间”：暗指这种殖民统治的“临时性”——英国对香港的治理, 始终面临"主权归属"的不确定性，**尤其是20世纪后半叶随着中国实力增强、国际局势变化，香港的未来注定需要重新协商，殖民统治的“倒计时”早已开始。

这句话精准捕捉了香港在殖民时期的矛盾性：一方面，英国在此建立了繁荣的贸易枢纽和都市体系（“发明了香港”）；另一方面，其存在始终笼罩在主权未定的阴影下，直至1997年归还中国。记者理查德·休斯引用此说法，亦反映了国际社会对香港前途的普遍认知。

The Chinese government’s official position toward Hong Kong’s history is spelled out succinctly in The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, the miniconstitution that has governed Hong Kong since its reversion to Chinese sovereignty in July 1997: “Hong Kong has been part of the territory of China since ancient times; it was occupied by Britain after the Opium War in 1840.” Whereas Chinese historians often stress how Hong Kong has played a vital role in Chinese history since time memorial, until recently British sources generally dismissed the idea of Hong Kong as having any real history until the British arrived.  +
A guidebook written in 1893 by a local British resident insisted that until 1841 Hong Kong “existed only as a plutonic island of uninviting sterility, apparently capable only of supporting the lowest form of organisms.”1 Many years later, journalist Richard Hughes, who popularized the idea of Hong Kong as a “borrowed place living on borrowed time,” wrote that “Hong Kong did not exist, so it was necessary to invent it.”
中国政府对香港历史的官方立场在《中华人民共和国香港特别行政区基本法》中得到了简洁明了的阐述。这部自 1997 年 7 月香港回归中国以来一直作为香港的“小宪法”进行治理：“香港自古以来就是中国领土的一部分；1840 年鸦片战争后被英国占领。” 尽管中国历史学家经常强调香港自古以来在中国历史上扮演着至关重要的角色，但直到最近，英国方面的资料普遍否认香港在英国到来之前拥有任何真正的历史。一位英国当地居民在 1893 年撰写的一本指南中坚称，直到 1841 年，香港“仅仅是一个荒凉贫瘠的孤岛，似乎只能维持最低等生物的生存”。 1 多年后，记者理查德·休斯（Richard Hughes）——他曾将香港比作“借来的地方，生活在借来的时间里”——写道：“香港并不存在，所以有必要把它创造出来。”  +

波利尼西亚, 是大洋洲的一个次区域 ，由散布在中太平洋和南太平洋的 1000 多个岛屿组成。居住在波利尼西亚岛屿上的土著居民, 被称为波利尼西亚人 。他们有很多共同之处，包括语言关系 、 文化习俗和传统信仰 。

By tradition, the islands located in the southern Pacific have also often been called the South Sea Islands,[2] and their inhabitants have been called South Sea Islanders. The Hawaiian Islands have often been considered to be part of the South Sea Islands because of their relative proximity to the southern Pacific islands, even though they are in fact located in the North Pacific. Another term in use, which avoids this inconsistency, is "the Polynesian Triangle" (from the shape created by the layout of the islands in the Pacific Ocean). This term makes clear that the grouping includes the Hawaiian Islands, which are located at the northern vertex of the referenced "triangle".

按照传统，位于南太平洋的岛屿也常被称为南海群岛 [ 2 ] ，其居民则被称为南海岛民 。 夏威夷群岛由于与南太平洋岛屿相对接近，常被认为是南海群岛的一部分，尽管它们实际上位于北太平洋 。另一个避免这种不一致的说法是**“ 波利尼西亚三角 ”（源于太平洋岛屿的布局所形成的形状）。**这个说法明确指出，*该区域包含了位于该“三角” 北端的夏威夷群岛。*

**波利尼西亚的特点是陆地面积小，却横跨太平洋中部和南部的大片海域。**其陆地面积约为 30 万至 31 万平方公里（11.7 万至 11.8 万平方英里），其中超过 27 万平方公里（ 10.3 万平方英里）位于新西兰境内。夏威夷群岛则占据了剩余面积的大约一半。

Precolonial Hong Kong was not the “barren island” or “barren rock” that British historians, colonial officials, and journalists have often described.  +
Archaeological findings from the Hong Kong region date back almost six thousand years, to the Neolithic period.  +
According to Chinese historical records, southern China was settled by the Hundred Yue tribes, who were more closely related to Malays, Vietnamese, or Polynesians than to Han Chinese, the ethnic majority of China, and who are believed to have made the rock carvings still preserved in several local sites.  +
The Southern Yue Kingdom ruled Hong Kong until 111 BCE, when it fell to the army of Wu Di, emperor of the Han dynasty.  +
A tomb uncovered at Lei Cheng Uk, Kowloon, in 1955 is believed to be from the Han period.  +
Over the next millennium, partly because of the warfare and disunity that characterized much of that period and partly because of the economic opportunities in southern China, Chinese increasingly moved from north to south, including to Kowloon, the peninsula across the harbor from Hong Kong Island.  +
Chinese historical records frequently mention Kowloon as the place where the emperor of the Southern Song dynasty sought refuge after China fell to the Mongols.
前殖民时期的香港并非英国历史学家、殖民官员和记者常描述的“荒岛”或“贫瘠岩石”。香港地区的考古发现可以追溯到近六千年前的新石器时代。据中国史料记载，中国南方曾居住着百越部落，他们与马来人、越南人或波利尼西亚人的血缘关系比与中国主体民族汉族更为密切，据信他们创作了至今仍保存在当地多处遗址的岩刻。南越王国统治香港直至公元前111年，最终被汉武帝的军队攻陷。1955年在九龙利城屋发现的一座墓葬据信属于汉代。在接下来的一千年里，部分原因是战乱和分裂充斥着这一时期，部分原因是中国南方蕴藏着巨大的经济机遇，中国人越来越多地从北向南迁徙，其中包括九龙——位于香港岛对岸的半岛。中国史籍多次提及九龙，称南宋皇帝在蒙古人入侵后曾到此避难。

During the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1276–1368), Hong Kong was inhabited mainly by farmers, fisherfolk, and pirates, some of them Song loyalists.  +
By the end of the Yuan dynasty, the Hong Kong region had been settled mainly by seven large families who owned much of the land.  +
Throughout the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), settlers from Guangdong and Fujian, the two prominent coastal provinces of southeastern China, migrated to Kowloon.  +
Some of these settlers moved across the harbor to Hong Kong Island, but the island remained lightly populated, with only a few villages scattered along its southern coast.  +
During the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), when China was ruled by the Manchus, Hong Kong became more closely integrated with the rest of China.  +
Fishing boats from other parts of southern China used the local harbors.  +
The island was part of Xin’an county, and an assistant magistrate from Kowloon visited the island occasionally to collect land taxes and register fishing vessels, leaving local headmen or village elders in charge of local government.  +
In the early 1800s, the island was the stronghold of the infamous pirate Zhang Baozai, who used the island’s peak as a lookout for his buccaneering exploits.

在元朝（1276-1368年）时期，香港主要居住着农民、渔民和海盗，其中一些人是宋朝的拥护者。元朝末年，香港地区主要由七个拥有大量土地的大家族定居。明朝（1368-1644年）时期，来自中国东南沿海两大省份广东和福建的移民涌入九龙。其中一些人迁往香港岛，但当时香港岛人口稀少，只有零星几个村庄散布在南部沿海。清朝（1644-1911年）时期，中国由满族统治，香港与中国其他地区的联系日益紧密。来自中国南方其他地区的渔船也开始使用香港的港口。该岛隶属于新安县，九龙的县令偶尔会到岛上征收地税、登记渔船，地方政务则由当地村长或长者负责。19世纪初，该岛是臭名昭著的海盗张宝载的据点，他曾利用岛上的山峰作为瞭望哨，监视其海盗行径。 +

.home ports for _a permanent boat population_ and _visiting craft_
（这些较大的沿海村庄）是永久性船民群体的‘家港’，也是往来船只的停靠港。

- home ports：不单指“港口”，更强调是船民群体的居住基地与生活中心。船民（疍家人等）常以船为家，但需要沿岸的村庄进行交易、补給、社交等活动。
- permanent boat population：指长期生活在船上的居民（即水上人家/疍民），他们在该区域定居，形成稳定的水上社区。
- visiting craft：指外来的、临时到访的船只（如商船、渔船等），这些村庄为其提供停泊、交易或休整的场所。

.a permanent boat population (常年以船为家的水上居民) 为何前面要有个 a?

为什么必须有 a？ +
population 在这里不是 “人口”，而是 “一群人、一类群体”，是可数名词。 +

- a population = 某一类人群、某一群人
- a permanent boat population = 一个常年以船为家的群体 / 水上常住居民群体

它强调的是：这是一类特定的人，不是整个岛的总人口。

类似用法： +
- a homeless population 无家可归者群体 +
- a rural population 农村人口群体 +
- a floating population 流动人口 +

a permanent boat population

这句话使用了部分倒装。

- 原句结构：
Hong Kong’s temples alone, argues Hayes, prove that...
- 正常语序应为：
Hayes argues that /Hong Kong’s temples alone​ *prove that*...

这里使用倒装主要是出于以下原因:

- 强调主语​: +
倒装后，句子真正的主语 “Hong Kong’s temples alone”​ 被移到了动词 “proves”​ 之前，并且**放在了句首最突出的位置。这强调了是“香港的庙宇本身”​ 提供了关键证据，**而不是其他材料或观点，突出了“物证”的客观性。

- 衔接与流畅性​: +
*在上下文中，前文可能一直在描述香港岛的早期社会状况，将“Hong Kong’s temples”放在句首，可以与上文内容形成更紧密的话题衔接，使论述自然过渡到海耶斯的观点。#如果把“Hayes argues”放在句首，则会打断对“物证”的连续性讨论，将读者的注意力先转移到“学者”身上。#*

- 文体风格​ : +
这种“名词短语 + 插入的引述动词 + 主要动词”（例如："…," argues Hayes, "…"或 "…," he writes, "…"）**是英语学术写作和历史著作中, 引证他人观点时的经典句式。**它既指明了观点来源，又保持了论述的客观性和流畅性，*#避免让“某人说”这类表达显得过于突兀或主观。#*

倒装的效果：

- 客观性：句式暗示观点是由证据本身（庙宇）引出的，而学者（Hayes）只是发现并陈述这一事实的人，增强了论证的说服力。
- 节奏感：将较长的名词主语提前，插入短小的“argues Hayes”，再接谓语（prove），使句子节奏更有变化，更符合书面语的韵律。

Not only was Hong Kong hardly a “barren island” when the British arrived in the late 1830s, but Hong Kong’s people were far from the “handful of fishermen and pirates” they have often been described as.  +
As historian and former colonial official James Hayes explains, farming was the “principle occupation.” The island had “several villages of some size, as well as hamlets, and a few larger coastal villages which served as market towns for the villages and as home ports for a permanent boat population and visiting craft.” Hayes concludes that “long before 1841,” the inhabitants of Hong Kong Island had “settled into the routine of a settled life.  +
Tied to their fields and houses, and to their businesses and daily occupations, they had established institutions of the kind that is usual in Chinese communities, including the shrines and temples that were the object of periodic and special rites through the calendar year.” Hong Kong’s temples alone, argues Hayes, prove that “the island was certainly well-established in settled communities long before 1841.”
19 世纪 30 年代末英国人抵达香港时，这里绝非“荒岛”，香港居民也远非人们常说的“寥寥几位渔民和海盗”。正如历史学家、前殖民地官员詹姆斯·海耶斯所解释的那样，农业是“主要职业”。岛上有“几个规模较大的村庄，以及一些小村落，还有一些较大的沿海村庄，这些村庄既是周边村庄的集镇，也是常住居民和来往船只的母港”。海耶斯总结道，“早在 1841 年之前”，香港岛的居民就已经“安顿下来，过上了规律的生活。他们耕耘田地，操持家务，从事各种生意和日常工作，建立了华人社区常见的各种机构，包括寺庙和祠堂，这些场所会在一年中的不同时期举行各种祭祀仪式。”海耶斯认为，仅香港的寺庙就足以证明“早在 1841 年之前，香港岛就已存在成熟的定居社区” 。³ +

== THE TAIPING REBELLION AND CHINESE EMIGRATION
太平天国运动与华人移民

Not only did many Chinese show their affiliation with Hong Kong by disobeying orders from Canton to return to China during the Second Opium War, but the local Chinese population also greatly expanded during this period.  +
And even though racial antagonisms and mutual suspicions between the Chinese and European populations increased during the war, the expansion of the Chinese community would eventually help make Hong Kong a major trading center.  +
This expansion occurred not because of the colonial government’s attempt to attract wealthier Chinese to Hong Kong but because of the combination of Chinese domestic turmoil and the worldwide rise of Western capitalism and imperialism, which encouraged Chinese emigration in two ways.
在第二次鸦片战争期间，许多华人不仅违抗广州的命令返回中国，以此表达他们对香港的认同，而且香港华人人口也在此期间大幅增长。尽管战争期间华人与欧洲人之间的种族敌对和相互猜忌加剧，但华人社区的扩张最终使香港成为重要的贸易中心。这种扩张并非殖民政府试图吸引富裕华人移居香港的结果，而是中国国内动荡局势与西方资本主义和帝国主义在全球范围内的崛起共同作用的结果，这从两个方面促进了华人移民。 +
The opening of Canton and other treaty ports by the Treaty of Nanking disrupted local economies.  +
Imports such as British cotton now competed with Chinese products in the markets of Canton, while Chinese junks lost out to larger, faster foreign vessels.  +
By the late 1840s and early 1850s, Canton had lost its hold on both tea and silk trades, causing unemployment throughout Guangdong.  +
Almost simultaneously, the abandonment of slavery by England, France, and some parts of the United States encouraged a demand for cheap, forced labor in Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and the West and East Indies.  +
In 1849 after gold was discovered in California, the first shipload of Chinese laborers came through Hong Kong, en route to the United States.  +
By December 1850, two thousand Chinese had left China for California.  +
Between January and June 1850, some ten thousand tons of shipping were loaded or partly loaded in Hong Kong and shipped to the western coast of the United States.  +
With this growth of overseas trade also came new Chinese labor and talent.  +
In 1850, Governor Bonham reported an increase in the Chinese population, mainly artisans from Canton working in the California trade.  +
Three years later he noted that the colony’s “commercial prospects are slowly but certainly extending and assuming a character of greater permanency.”
《南京条约》开放广州及其他通商口岸，扰乱了当地经济。英国棉花等进口商品开始与中国产品在广州市场展开竞争，而中国帆船则败给了更大、更快的外国船只。到19世纪40年代末50年代初，广州失去了对茶叶和丝绸贸易的控制权，导致广东各地失业率居高不下。几乎与此同时，英国、法国和美国部分地区废除奴隶制，刺激了加拿大、美国、澳大利亚、新西兰以及西印度群岛和东印度群岛对廉价强迫劳动力的需求。1849年加利福尼亚发现金矿后，第一批中国劳工经香港前往美国。到1850年12月，已有两千名中国人离开中国前往加利福尼亚。1850年1月至6月间，约一万吨货物在香港装船或部分装船，运往美国西海岸。随着海外贸易的增长，也带来了新的中国劳动力和人才。 1850年，邦纳姆总督报告说，华人人口有所增加，主要是来自广州的工匠，他们在加利福尼亚从事贸易。三年后，他指出，该殖民地的“商业前景正在缓慢但稳步地扩展，并呈现出更加持久的特征”。 +
Hong Kong’s economic recovery began in the early 1850s, when many Chinese merchants came to Hong Kong to escape the Taiping Rebellion.  +
In 1837, Hong Xiuquan, a Chinese from Guangdong who had failed the civil service examination, had a nervous breakdown.  +
Years later, after failing the examination a fourth time and reading Christian tracts produced by Protestant missionaries, he became convinced that he was the second son of Jehovah and the younger brother of Jesus Christ.  +
He had been ordered to oust the Manchu “imps and demons” from China and to establish the Taiping Kingdom, or “Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace.” When Hong and his Society of God Worshippers started proselytizing in Guangxi province, an area outside of government control and teeming with secret societies that claimed their loyalty to the Ming dynasty, their crusade gained a political edge.  +
Armed with an ideology based on quasi-Christian beliefs, the abolition of private property and the institution of a communal land system, the segregation of men and women, and strict prohibitions against liquor, tobacco, and opium, Hong’s rebels moved northeast from Guangxi and through the middle Yangzi Valley.  +
In 1853 they captured Nanjing, renaming the city the “Heavenly Capital” and making it their capital for more than ten years.  +
The rebellion might have ended the Qing dynasty were it not eventually suppressed in 1864 by provincial armies led by Chinese commanders, along with help from Western munitions and mercenaries.
香港的经济复苏始于19世纪50年代初，当时许多中国商人为了躲避太平天国运动而来到香港。1837年，一位名叫洪秀全的广东人，因科举落榜而精神崩溃。多年后，他第四次科举落榜，并阅读了基督教传教士制作的小册子，深信自己是耶和华的次子，耶稣基督的弟弟。他奉命将满清的“妖魔鬼怪”驱逐出中国，建立太平天国，即“天国大和平”。当洪秀全和他的“神敬会”开始在广西传教时，由于广西当时处于政府控制之外，且充斥着许多自称效忠明朝的秘密社团，他们的传教活动逐渐获得了政治意义。洪氏起义军以准基督教信仰为基础，主张废除私有财产，建立公有土地制度，实行男女隔离，并严格禁止酒、烟、鸦片等消费。他们从广西出发，向东北方向进发，途经长江中游。1853年，他们攻占南京，将这座城市改名为“天都”，并以此为都城长达十余年。若非最终在1864年被中国将领率领的地方军队，以及西方军火和雇佣兵的援助镇压，这场起义或许会终结清朝的统治。 +
The Taiping Rebellion and its suppression cost at least twenty million lives, devastated parts of the Chinese countryside, and wiped out entire cities.  +
Those who could afford to do so fled to the safety of the treaty ports, especially to Shanghai, protected by its large Western settlement.  +
Although the rebellion fueled tensions in Hong Kong, it also helped pull the colony out of its economic slump.  +
From 1853 to 1859 the Chinese population of Hong Kong rose from approximately forty thousand to around eighty-five thousand, even with the mass departures during the Second Opium War.  +
Officials and visitors often commented on how the turbulent conditions in China had brought new traders to the colony and improved living standards.  +
When journalist Wang Tao first arrived in Hong Kong, “merchants generally wore short jackets and put on a cotton overcoat when the weather got cold.  +
The women paid little attention to their dress.” But he later observed that “drastic changes are now taking place in the way of life in Hong Kong.  +
People are beginning to pursue luxury....  +
Bright lamps burn through the night, and loud music is heard until the small hours.  +
Hong Kong’s prosperity now exceeds that of Canton, and it is all the result of fate and chance.”26
太平天国运动及其镇压造成至少两千万人丧生，摧毁了中国部分乡村，并夷平了整座城市。有能力的人纷纷逃往通商口岸寻求庇护，尤其是受西部商站保护的上海。尽管太平天国运动加剧了香港的紧张局势，但也帮助香港摆脱了经济衰退。1853 年至 1859 年间，香港的华人人口从约四万人增长到约八万五千人，即便是在第二次鸦片战争期间经历了大规模人口外流之后，这一数字依然保持稳定。官员和来访者经常提到，中国动荡的局势为香港带来了新的商人，并提高了当地居民的生活水平。记者王涛初到香港时，“商人们通常穿着短袄，天气转凉时才穿上棉袄。妇女们则不太注重穿着打扮。”但他后来观察到，“香港的生活方式正在发生剧烈的变化。人们开始追求奢华……灯火通明，音乐声响彻夜空。香港的繁荣程度如今超过了广州，而这一切都是命运和机遇的结果。” 26 +
The combination of the Taiping Rebellion, Chinese emigration, and the growth of overseas Chinese communities had three important effects on Hong Kong’s economy.  +
It transformed Hong Kong from a colonial outpost into the center of a transnational overseas Chinese trade network stretching from the China coast to Southeast Asia and all the way to Australia and the Americas.  +
The rebellion and the rise of overseas Chinese communities also created a new class of wealthy Chinese in Hong Kong, where they became settlers rather than sojourners.  +
Among these new immigrants were wealthy Chinese who brought their families, capital, entrepreneurial skills, and business connections.  +
Examples include the Li brothers, who came from Guangdong during the early 1850s.  +
In 1857 the brothers became the largest brokers of immigrant labor and charterers of immigrant ships.  +
By the mid-1860s, their family holdings included insurance, real estate, and interests in the opium monopoly.  +
As head of this successful family, Li Sing became one of the colony’s most prominent merchants.  +
With the arrival of such men, a new Chinese business elite had emerged in Hong Kong colony by the late 1850s.
太平天国运动、华人移民潮以及海外华人社区的壮大，对香港经济产生了三大重要影响。首先，它将香港从一个殖民地前哨转变为一个跨国华人贸易网络的中心，该网络从中国沿海延伸至东南亚，甚至远至澳大利亚和美洲。其次，太平天国运动和海外华人社区的兴起，也催生了香港一个新的富裕阶层，他们不再是过客，而是定居者。这些新移民中不乏富裕的华人，他们带来了家人、资本、商业技能和人脉。例如，李氏兄弟于19世纪50年代初从广东来到香港。1857年，他们成为最大的劳工中介和移民船承租人。到19世纪60年代中期，他们的家族产业涵盖保险、房地产以及鸦片垄断。作为这个成功家族的掌门人，李星成为香港最杰出的商人之一。随着这些人的到来，到 19 世纪 50 年代末，香港殖民地出现了一个新的华人商业精英阶层。 +
Finally, Hong Kong’s economic growth benefited local European merchants and attracted new foreign investment.  +
Several new European banks were opened in the late 1850s and early 1860s.  +
American and Portuguese firms moved from Canton and Macau.  +
In 1857 Douglas Lapraik, a Scot who had begun his Hong Kong career as a watchmaker’s apprentice, cofounded Hong Kong’s first dry dock.  +
By the time of his death in 1869, he owned a fleet of seven steamships.  +
Shipping between Hong Kong and Canton and the United States and Australia also increased.  +
The clearest indicator of foreign investors’ new confidence in the colony’s economy can be seen in the founding of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank in July 1864.  +
Until then, local banking services for foreign merchants had been provided by larger European hongs.  +
Most of the Western banks in Hong Kong and China were branch offices of Anglo-Indian banks such as the Oriental Bank and the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China—exchange banks controlled from India or England.  +
The founding of the new bank was heralded as a sign of the colony’s prosperity.  +
Chinese capital was important from the start, and the bank would become the leading bank on the China coast.  +
In the absence of any formal central bank, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank would act as Hong Kong’s central bank until the last years of the colonial era.  +
By the late twentieth century, it had become one of the largest financial institutions in the world.
最终，香港的经济增长惠及了当地的欧洲商人，并吸引了新的外国投资。19 世纪 50 年代末至 60 年代初，多家新的欧洲银行相继成立。美国和葡萄牙公司也从广州和澳门迁至香港。1857 年，苏格兰人道格拉斯·拉普雷克（Douglas Lapraik）在香港以钟表匠学徒的身份起家，后来与人合伙创办了香港第一家干船坞。到 1869 年去世时，他已拥有七艘蒸汽船。香港与广州、美国和澳大利亚之间的航运也日益繁忙。1864 年 7 月香港上海汇丰银行的成立，最能体现外国投资者对香港经济信心的增强。在此之前，香港的银行业务主要由规模较大的欧洲银行提供。当时，香港和中国的大多数西方银行都是英印银行的分支机构，例如东方银行和印度、澳大利亚和中国特许银行——这些汇兑银行由印度或英国控制。新银行的成立被视为殖民地繁荣的标志。中国资本从一开始就至关重要，这家银行也很快发展成为中国沿海地区首屈一指的银行。由于当时香港没有正式的中央银行，香港上海汇丰银行在殖民时代的最后几年里一直扮演着香港中央银行的角色。到 20 世纪末，它已成为世界上最大的金融机构之一。 +
