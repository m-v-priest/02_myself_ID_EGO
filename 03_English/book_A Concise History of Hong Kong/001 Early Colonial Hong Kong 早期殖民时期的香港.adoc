== 1 Early Colonial Hong Kong  早期殖民时期的香港


`主` The Chinese government’s official position 姿势，观点，立场 toward Hong Kong’s history `系` is spelled out 用字母拼写,解释明白；讲清楚 succinctly 简洁地；简要地 in _The Basic Law_ of _the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region_ 行政区 of _the People’s Republic of China_, the miniconstitution 迷你宪法 that has governed Hong Kong since its reversion 回归；归还 to Chinese sovereignty 主权 in July 1997: “Hong Kong has been part of the territory 领土；版图 of China since ancient times; it was occupied 占据；侵占 by Britain after the Opium War 鸦片战争 in 1840.”  +
#Whereas# 然而；尽管 Chinese historians often stress 强调 how Hong Kong *has played a vital 至关重要的；生死攸关的 role* in Chinese history _since time memorial_ (a.纪念的；悼念的) 自纪念时间以来, 自古以来；远古以来, until recently British sources (信息来源；原始资料)  英国方面资料,英国史学界 generally #*dismissed*# 不予考虑；摒弃；驳回 the idea of Hong Kong #*as*# 把 A 当作 B 而否定,不予理会 having any real history until the British arrived.

但直到最近，英国方面的资料普遍否定 “香港在英国到来之前, 拥有任何真正历史” 这一观点。

Many years later, journalist Richard Hughes, who popularized (v.)使普及；使流行；推广 the idea of Hong Kong as _a “borrowed place_ living on 依靠，以……为生 _borrowed time_ 苟延残喘；借时度日；在借来的时光中生存,” wrote that “Hong Kong did not exist, so it was necessary to invent 创造；虚构；发明 it.”

-> From French plutonique ‎(“of or pertaining to #Pluto#(冥王星；冥王), the underworld, interior of the Earth”)

.a “borrowed place living on borrowed time”
“A borrowed place living on borrowed time” 这句话常被用来形容香港在殖民时期的特殊地位，其含义可从两个层面理解：

- **“借来的地方”：指香港（尤指香港岛）是英国通过《南京条约》（1842年）从清政府手中“借用”或割占的领土，**其统治权并非基于历史或自然延续，而是依托殖民条约建立的临时性安排。
- **“借来的时间”：暗指这种殖民统治的“临时性”——英国对香港的治理, 始终面临"主权归属"的不确定性，**尤其是20世纪后半叶随着中国实力增强、国际局势变化，香港的未来注定需要重新协商，殖民统治的“倒计时”早已开始。

这句话精准捕捉了香港在殖民时期的矛盾性：一方面，英国在此建立了繁荣的贸易枢纽和都市体系（“发明了香港”）；另一方面，其存在始终笼罩在主权未定的阴影下，直至1997年归还中国。记者理查德·休斯引用此说法，亦反映了国际社会对香港前途的普遍认知。

The Chinese government’s official position toward Hong Kong’s history is spelled out succinctly in The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, the miniconstitution that has governed Hong Kong since its reversion to Chinese sovereignty in July 1997: “Hong Kong has been part of the territory of China since ancient times; it was occupied by Britain after the Opium War in 1840.” Whereas Chinese historians often stress how Hong Kong has played a vital role in Chinese history since time memorial, until recently British sources generally dismissed the idea of Hong Kong as having any real history until the British arrived.  +
A guidebook written in 1893 by a local British resident insisted that until 1841 Hong Kong “existed only as a plutonic island of uninviting sterility, apparently capable only of supporting the lowest form of organisms.”1 Many years later, journalist Richard Hughes, who popularized the idea of Hong Kong as a “borrowed place living on borrowed time,” wrote that “Hong Kong did not exist, so it was necessary to invent it.”
中国政府对香港历史的官方立场在《中华人民共和国香港特别行政区基本法》中得到了简洁明了的阐述。这部自 1997 年 7 月香港回归中国以来一直作为香港的“小宪法”进行治理：“香港自古以来就是中国领土的一部分；1840 年鸦片战争后被英国占领。” 尽管中国历史学家经常强调香港自古以来在中国历史上扮演着至关重要的角色，但直到最近，英国方面的资料普遍否认香港在英国到来之前拥有任何真正的历史。一位英国当地居民在 1893 年撰写的一本指南中坚称，直到 1841 年，香港“仅仅是一个荒凉贫瘠的孤岛，似乎只能维持最低等生物的生存”。 1 多年后，记者理查德·休斯（Richard Hughes）——他曾将香港比作“借来的地方，生活在借来的时间里”——写道：“香港并不存在，所以有必要把它创造出来。”  +

波利尼西亚, 是大洋洲的一个次区域 ，由散布在中太平洋和南太平洋的 1000 多个岛屿组成。居住在波利尼西亚岛屿上的土著居民, 被称为波利尼西亚人 。他们有很多共同之处，包括语言关系 、 文化习俗和传统信仰 。

By tradition, the islands located in the southern Pacific have also often been called the South Sea Islands,[2] and their inhabitants have been called South Sea Islanders. The Hawaiian Islands have often been considered to be part of the South Sea Islands because of their relative proximity to the southern Pacific islands, even though they are in fact located in the North Pacific. Another term in use, which avoids this inconsistency, is "the Polynesian Triangle" (from the shape created by the layout of the islands in the Pacific Ocean). This term makes clear that the grouping includes the Hawaiian Islands, which are located at the northern vertex of the referenced "triangle".

按照传统，位于南太平洋的岛屿也常被称为南海群岛 [ 2 ] ，其居民则被称为南海岛民 。 夏威夷群岛由于与南太平洋岛屿相对接近，常被认为是南海群岛的一部分，尽管它们实际上位于北太平洋 。另一个避免这种不一致的说法是**“ 波利尼西亚三角 ”（源于太平洋岛屿的布局所形成的形状）。**这个说法明确指出，*该区域包含了位于该“三角” 北端的夏威夷群岛。*

**波利尼西亚的特点是陆地面积小，却横跨太平洋中部和南部的大片海域。**其陆地面积约为 30 万至 31 万平方公里（11.7 万至 11.8 万平方英里），其中超过 27 万平方公里（ 10.3 万平方英里）位于新西兰境内。夏威夷群岛则占据了剩余面积的大约一半。

Precolonial Hong Kong was not the “barren island” or “barren rock” that British historians, colonial officials, and journalists have often described.  +
Archaeological findings from the Hong Kong region date back almost six thousand years, to the Neolithic period.  +
According to Chinese historical records, southern China was settled by the Hundred Yue tribes, who were more closely related to Malays, Vietnamese, or Polynesians than to Han Chinese, the ethnic majority of China, and who are believed to have made the rock carvings still preserved in several local sites.  +
The Southern Yue Kingdom ruled Hong Kong until 111 BCE, when it fell to the army of Wu Di, emperor of the Han dynasty.  +
A tomb uncovered at Lei Cheng Uk, Kowloon, in 1955 is believed to be from the Han period.  +
Over the next millennium, partly because of the warfare and disunity that characterized much of that period and partly because of the economic opportunities in southern China, Chinese increasingly moved from north to south, including to Kowloon, the peninsula across the harbor from Hong Kong Island.  +
Chinese historical records frequently mention Kowloon as the place where the emperor of the Southern Song dynasty sought refuge after China fell to the Mongols.
前殖民时期的香港并非英国历史学家、殖民官员和记者常描述的“荒岛”或“贫瘠岩石”。香港地区的考古发现可以追溯到近六千年前的新石器时代。据中国史料记载，中国南方曾居住着百越部落，他们与马来人、越南人或波利尼西亚人的血缘关系比与中国主体民族汉族更为密切，据信他们创作了至今仍保存在当地多处遗址的岩刻。南越王国统治香港直至公元前111年，最终被汉武帝的军队攻陷。1955年在九龙利城屋发现的一座墓葬据信属于汉代。在接下来的一千年里，部分原因是战乱和分裂充斥着这一时期，部分原因是中国南方蕴藏着巨大的经济机遇，中国人越来越多地从北向南迁徙，其中包括九龙——位于香港岛对岸的半岛。中国史籍多次提及九龙，称南宋皇帝在蒙古人入侵后曾到此避难。

During the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1276–1368), Hong Kong was inhabited mainly by farmers, fisherfolk, and pirates, some of them Song loyalists.  +
By the end of the Yuan dynasty, the Hong Kong region had been settled mainly by seven large families who owned much of the land.  +
Throughout the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), settlers from Guangdong and Fujian, the two prominent coastal provinces of southeastern China, migrated to Kowloon.  +
Some of these settlers moved across the harbor to Hong Kong Island, but the island remained lightly populated, with only a few villages scattered along its southern coast.  +
During the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), when China was ruled by the Manchus, Hong Kong became more closely integrated with the rest of China.  +
Fishing boats from other parts of southern China used the local harbors.  +
The island was part of Xin’an county, and an assistant magistrate from Kowloon visited the island occasionally to collect land taxes and register fishing vessels, leaving local headmen or village elders in charge of local government.  +
In the early 1800s, the island was the stronghold of the infamous pirate Zhang Baozai, who used the island’s peak as a lookout for his buccaneering exploits.

在元朝（1276-1368年）时期，香港主要居住着农民、渔民和海盗，其中一些人是宋朝的拥护者。元朝末年，香港地区主要由七个拥有大量土地的大家族定居。明朝（1368-1644年）时期，来自中国东南沿海两大省份广东和福建的移民涌入九龙。其中一些人迁往香港岛，但当时香港岛人口稀少，只有零星几个村庄散布在南部沿海。清朝（1644-1911年）时期，中国由满族统治，香港与中国其他地区的联系日益紧密。来自中国南方其他地区的渔船也开始使用香港的港口。该岛隶属于新安县，九龙的县令偶尔会到岛上征收地税、登记渔船，地方政务则由当地村长或长者负责。19世纪初，该岛是臭名昭著的海盗张宝载的据点，他曾利用岛上的山峰作为瞭望哨，监视其海盗行径。 +

*As* 正如 historian 历史学家 and former colonial 殖民的 official 官员 James Hayes *explains*, farming was the “principal 主要的 occupation 职业；工作.”  +

.home ports for _a permanent boat population_ and _visiting craft_
（这些较大的沿海村庄）是永久性船民群体的‘家港’，也是往来船只的停靠港。

- home ports：不单指“港口”，更强调是船民群体的居住基地与生活中心。船民（疍家人等）常以船为家，但需要沿岸的村庄进行交易、补給、社交等活动。
- permanent boat population：指长期生活在船上的居民（即水上人家/疍民），他们在该区域定居，形成稳定的水上社区。
- visiting craft：指外来的、临时到访的船只（如商船、渔船等），这些村庄为其提供停泊、交易或休整的场所。

.a permanent boat population (常年以船为家的水上居民) 为何前面要有个 a?

为什么必须有 a？ +
population 在这里不是 “人口”，而是 “一群人、一类群体”，是可数名词。 +

- a population = 某一类人群、某一群人
- a permanent boat population = 一个常年以船为家的群体 / 水上常住居民群体

它强调的是：这是一类特定的人，不是整个岛的总人口。

类似用法： +
- a homeless population 无家可归者群体 +
- a rural population 农村人口群体 +
- a floating population 流动人口 +

a permanent boat population
= 一类常年住在船上的人（可数群体 → 必须加 a）

这句话使用了部分倒装。

- 原句结构：
Hong Kong’s temples alone, argues Hayes, prove that...
- 正常语序应为：
Hayes argues that /Hong Kong’s temples alone​ *prove that*...

这里使用倒装主要是出于以下原因:

- 强调主语​: +
倒装后，句子真正的主语 “Hong Kong’s temples alone”​ 被移到了动词 “proves”​ 之前，并且**放在了句首最突出的位置。这强调了是“香港的庙宇本身”​ 提供了关键证据，**而不是其他材料或观点，突出了“物证”的客观性。

- 衔接与流畅性​: +
*在上下文中，前文可能一直在描述香港岛的早期社会状况，将“Hong Kong’s temples”放在句首，可以与上文内容形成更紧密的话题衔接，使论述自然过渡到海耶斯的观点。#如果把“Hayes argues”放在句首，则会打断对“物证”的连续性讨论，将读者的注意力先转移到“学者”身上。#*

- 文体风格​ : +
这种“名词短语 + 插入的引述动词 + 主要动词”（例如："…," argues Hayes, "…"或 "…," he writes, "…"）**是英语学术写作和历史著作中, 引证他人观点时的经典句式。**它既指明了观点来源，又保持了论述的客观性和流畅性，*#避免让“某人说”这类表达显得过于突兀或主观。#*

倒装的效果：

- 客观性：句式暗示观点是由证据本身（庙宇）引出的，而学者（Hayes）只是发现并陈述这一事实的人，增强了论证的说服力。
- 节奏感：将较长的名词主语提前，插入短小的“argues Hayes”，再接谓语（prove），使句子节奏更有变化，更符合书面语的韵律。

Not only was Hong Kong hardly a “barren island” when the British arrived in the late 1830s, but Hong Kong’s people were far from the “handful of fishermen and pirates” they have often been described as.  +
As historian and former colonial official James Hayes explains, farming was the “principle occupation.” The island had “several villages of some size, as well as hamlets, and a few larger coastal villages which served as market towns for the villages and as home ports for a permanent boat population and visiting craft.” Hayes concludes that “long before 1841,” the inhabitants of Hong Kong Island had “settled into the routine of a settled life.  +
Tied to their fields and houses, and to their businesses and daily occupations, they had established institutions of the kind that is usual in Chinese communities, including the shrines and temples that were the object of periodic and special rites through the calendar year.” Hong Kong’s temples alone, argues Hayes, prove that “the island was certainly well-established in settled communities long before 1841.”
19 世纪 30 年代末英国人抵达香港时，这里绝非“荒岛”，香港居民也远非人们常说的“寥寥几位渔民和海盗”。正如历史学家、前殖民地官员詹姆斯·海耶斯所解释的那样，农业是“主要职业”。岛上有“几个规模较大的村庄，以及一些小村落，还有一些较大的沿海村庄，这些村庄既是周边村庄的集镇，也是常住居民和来往船只的母港”。海耶斯总结道，“早在 1841 年之前”，香港岛的居民就已经“安顿下来，过上了规律的生活。他们耕耘田地，操持家务，从事各种生意和日常工作，建立了华人社区常见的各种机构，包括寺庙和祠堂，这些场所会在一年中的不同时期举行各种祭祀仪式。”海耶斯认为，仅香港的寺庙就足以证明“早在 1841 年之前，香港岛就已存在成熟的定居社区” 。³ +

In the midst of this uncertainty and insecurity, Hong Kong became embroiled in another war between Britain and China.  +
Most historians have focused on the Second Opium War primarily as yet another Sino-British conflict or on the war’s effects on Hong Kong.  +
However, both the war and its local repercussions were shaped not only by developments in Hong Kong and China but also by global events that affected the British Empire.  +
The underlying cause of the war was that the Treaty of Nanking had not given the British all that they wanted, whereas from the Qing point of view it had conceded too much.  +
Britain hoped the treaty would lead to more treaties that would eventually open China to foreign trade, primarily for the benefit of Britain but also for China and the world.  +
For the Qing, the treaty was simply a way to keep the foreigners at bay.  +
The treaty had not produced the boom in trade that the British had expected and had left too many issues unresolved.  +
Throughout the 1850s, Sino-British relations were plagued by the Canton question: the English text of the treaty gave the British the right to enter the city of Canton, but the Chinese text restricted them to its port.  +
Not only did the treaty not grant the British diplomatic residence in the capital at Beijing, but British officials did not have direct access to Chinese officials in Canton.
在这样动荡不安的局势下，香港卷入了英中之间的另一场战争。大多数历史学家将第二次鸦片战争主要视为又一场中英冲突，或侧重于战争对香港的影响。然而，这场战争及其在香港的余波，不仅受到香港和中国局势发展的影响，也受到影响大英帝国的全球事件的影响。战争的根本原因在于，《南京条约》未能满足英国的所有要求，而清政府则认为该条约让步过多。英国希望该条约能够促成更多条约的签订，最终打开中国对外贸易的大门，这主要有利于英国自身，但也惠及中国乃至世界。对清政府而言，该条约仅仅是阻止外国势力入侵的一种手段。该条约并未带来英国预期的贸易繁荣，反而遗留了诸多悬而未决的问题。整个19世纪50年代，中英关系都受到广州问题的困扰：条约的英文文本赋予英国人进入广州城的权利，而中文文本则将他们限制在广州港。该条约不仅没有赋予英国在首都北京设立外交机构的权利，而且英国官员也无法直接接触广州的中国官员。 +

Although it is not true, as it is often claimed, that the treaty 条约 did not even mention opium —Article 4 stipulated (v.)规定；约定 that /the “Emperor of China agrees to pay the sum 金额，款项 of Six Million Dollars as the value of Opium which *was delivered 递送；传送；交付；运载 up* 交出；交付；移交 at Canton in the month of March 1839” —the treaty did not discuss the opium trade or its legality 合法性；法律地位. +

.案例
====
Although it is not true, as it is often claimed, that the treaty did not even mention opium—Article 4 stipulated that the “Emperor of China agrees to pay the sum of Six Million Dollars as the value of Opium which was delivered up at Canton in the month of March 1839”—the treaty did not discuss the opium trade or its legality.  +
Furthermore, the treaty made no provision for future revisions.  +
Because the Treaty of Wanghia signed between the United States and China in 1844 included provision for revisions in twelve years, the British hoped that they might use the most-favored-nation clause in the Treaty of Nanking to push for revisions.  +
Most important, Britain’s global position depended on opium: Britain used the revenue from the opium trade to buy tea and silk from China and to support the occupation of India, Chinese merchants used the profits from tea and silk to buy opium from British traders, Indian producers used revenues from opium to buy British goods, and British merchants used the profits from selling British goods to buy cotton from the United States.  +
The sale of Indian opium to China, writes historian J.Y.Wong, ”was a great link in the chain of commerce with which Britain had surrounded the world.“20 Thus, in 1854 the British requested more concessions, including the legalization of the opium trade, the freedom to sail and trade on the Yangzi River, and the right to diplomatic representation in Beijing.
尽管并非如常人所言，该条约完全没有提及鸦片——第四条规定“中国皇帝同意支付六百万美元，作为 1839 年 3 月在广州交付的鸦片的价值”——但该条约确实没有讨论鸦片贸易及其合法性。此外，该条约也没有规定未来修订的条款。由于 1844 年美国与中国签订的《望家条约》规定了十二年后的修订条款，英国希望能够利用《南京条约》中的最惠国条款来推动条约的修订。最重要的是，英国的全球地位依赖于鸦片：英国利用鸦片贸易的收入从中国购买茶叶和丝绸，并支持其对印度的占领；中国商人利用茶叶和丝绸的利润从英国商人手中购买鸦片；印度生产者利用鸦片的收入购买英国商品；英国商人则利用出售英国商品的利润从美国购买棉花。历史学家黄俊耀（JY Wong）写道，印度鸦片对中国的出口“是英国环绕世界的贸易链条中的重要一环”。 20 因此，在 1854 年，英国要求获得更多让步，包括鸦片贸易合法化、在长江上航行和贸易的自由，以及在北京设立外交代表机构的权利。 +

.consul
a government official who is the representative of his or her country in a foreign city 领事

[.my3]
[options="autowidth" cols="1a,1a,1a"]
|===
| 职位 | 核心身份 | 主要任务

| Consul (领事) | 派驻在某个城市的“事务官”。
| 照顾本国侨民、发签证、处理贸易杂事。

#*Consul 通常不驻扎在首都，而是在主要的商埠或大城市*#（比如 19 世纪的广州、厦门）。

职能： ##**他不负责两国的政治博弈，主要管的是“民生”和“生意”。**##比如：如果你在国外丢了护照，或者本国商船在码头被扣了，你就去找领事。

通俗比喻： 领事就像是“驻外办事处主任”。他是个管家，解决具体麻烦的。

| Ambassador (大使) | 国家元首派往另一国首都的“全权代表”。
| 负责国家间的高层政治关系、传话。

#*Ambassador (大使) —— “元首的传声筒”*# +
Ambassador 的级别非常高。在古代，大使被视为国王的化身，他的一言一行代表着国家元首。

职能： #*驻扎在对方首都，负责维护两国之间的整体关系。他要向对方的政府递交国书，参加国宴。*#

通俗比喻： 大使就像是**“元首的替身”**。他主要是去“刷脸”和“搞社交”的，维持两家人的面子和交情。

| Plenipotentiary (全权代表) | 拥有“代笔签名权”的特殊代理人。
| 负责谈大事（如签条约、定国界），权力极大。

Plenipotentiary (全权代表) —— “带着空白支票的人” +
这个词源自拉丁语，pleni（满的）+ potent（权力）。在 19 世纪的远东史中，你经常会看到这个词（比如签订《南京条约》时）。

职能： #*他不仅仅是去传话的。政府给了他一项特殊的特权：在不需要反复请示国内的情况下，现场拍板做决定。 只要他在条约上签字，就等同于他背后的国家承认了。*#

通俗比喻： 他就像是**“钦差大臣”。皇帝给了他一把“尚方宝剑”，还给了他一张已经盖好章的空白支票**。他说怎么签，就怎么签。
|===

具体的例子：鸦片战争时期的角色 +
为了让你看清这三者的互动，我们假设一个场景：

- Consul (领事)： 驻广州的英国领事发现英国商人的鸦片被没收了，他跑去跟两广总督吵架，要求还钱。他管的是具体的纠纷。
- Ambassador (大使)： 英国政府觉得领事搞不定，想派一个大使去北京见皇上，谈谈两国长期共处的大计。他代表的是国家的面子。
- Plenipotentiary (全权代表)： 仗打完了，英国政府派来一个 Plenipotentiary（比如亨利·璞鼎查）。他带着军队来，直接跟清朝代表说：“这五条要求，你们必须签，我也准备好签了。” 他负责的是决定命运的谈判。

在 19 世纪，由于没有电报，从伦敦到香港来回要几个月，所以派往远东的高级官员, 通常都被赋予了 Plenipotentiary 的头衔，否则凡事都要写信回伦敦请示，仗都打完了信还没寄到。

当谓语动词由助动词（如 had, have, is, will）和主要动词（如 been, done, gone）组成时，频度副词或时间副词, 通常习惯于**“插在中间”**。


为什么不写成 earlier had been？
虽然 earlier had been 在语法上并不算绝对错误，但它听起来非常别扭且不自然。

*在英语中，当句子包含助动词（如 had, have, will等）和实义动词（如 been, done, gone等）时，副词通常不放在助动词之前，而是插在助动词与实义动词之间。*

香港与第二次中英战争有着千丝万缕的联系。时任香港总督兼英国驻华全权代表和贸易总监的鲍林曾请求与广州总督叶明臣举行正式会晤，但双方未能就合适的会晤地点达成一致。鲍林于 1854 年来到香港，深信与中国的另一场冲突即将爆发。他对中国文化颇感兴趣，决心修复英中关系，尽管他的前任们都未能成功。然而，在广州担任英国领事的四年经历让他确信，英国需要对华采取更为强硬的政策，只有通过武力才能使中国清醒过来。鲍林是一位一神论者，也是自由主义哲学家杰里米·边沁和约翰·斯图亚特·密尔的朋友和仰慕者，他坚定地拥护自由贸易。他坚信没有任何国家能够抵挡这股最终将改变世界的“大潮流”，他曾说过：“耶稣基督就是自由贸易，自由贸易就是耶稣基督。” 鲍林早年曾任和平协会会长，该协会倡导废除战争，并通过调解和平解决国际争端（1855 年，他成为首位与暹罗缔结条约的西方人）。他还希望香港华人能享受更人道的待遇（1846 年，作为国会议员，他曾谴责香港对轻微罪行普遍使用鞭刑）。然而，他却促成了中英之间的另一场战争。 +

- Flying：在这里指旗帜“悬挂着”或“飘扬着”。
- Had been flying：使用过去完成时, 是因为这个动作发生在“登船（boarded）”这个过去动作之前。表示在警察登船那个时间点之前，旗帜一直处于飘扬状态。

中方官员和船员表达的意思是：“我们不承认‘旗子当时在飘’这种说法。” +
所以，中方官员是在说：“我们上船的时候，那根杆子上光秃秃的，根本（at all）没见什么英国旗，更别提把它扯下来了！”

1860 年， 清朝根据 《北京条约》 将该岛连同九龙割让给大不列颠及爱尔兰联合王国 。最初，英国人将该岛用作采石场，因此该岛得名 “Stonecutters Island ”。19 世纪 50 年代，该岛曾是监狱所在地。

Stonecutters Island 这个名字的由来, 是因为英国人最初在那里采石。

The Treaty of Tientsin, signed in June 1858 by China, Britain, France, Russia, and the United States, meant more indemnities, diplomatic residence in Beijing, the opening of ten more Chinese ports to foreign trade, and access to China’s hinterland for Western missionaries and traders. +
A supplementary treaty in October imposed a tariff on the importation of opium, effectively legalizing the opium trade.  +
The war continued, however, with the Anglo-French forces occupying Beijing, burning the Summer Palace, and forcing the Xianfeng emperor into exile.  +
The Convention of Peking, accepted in 1860 by the emperor’s younger brother, Prince Gong, raised the indemnities, reaffirmed the British right to diplomatic residence in Beijing, and ceded to Britain the Kowloon Peninsula along with Stonecutters Island, a small island to the west of Hong Kong Island.
1858年6月，中国、英国、法国、俄国和美国签署了《天津条约》。该条约规定了更高的赔款额度、在北京设立外交机构、开放十个中国港口进行对外贸易，以及西方传教士和商人进入中国腹地的权利。同年10月签署的补充条约对鸦片进口征收关税，实际上使鸦片贸易合法化。然而，战争仍在继续，英法联军占领北京，焚毁颐和园，迫使咸丰皇帝流亡。1860年，咸丰皇帝的弟弟恭亲王接受了《北京条约》。该条约提高了赔款额度，重申了英国在北京设立外交机构的权利，并将九龙半岛以及香港岛西侧的小岛昂船洲割让给英国。 +

across the harbor：字面意思是“横跨港湾”，即“在港湾的对岸”。 +
from Hong Kong Island：表示“从香港岛出发”或“相对于香港岛而言”。 +

这个 harbor, 就是香港岛与九龙半岛之间隔着维多利亚港（Victoria Harbour）。

#*这里的 harbor（港湾）指的是维多利亚港（Victoria Harbour），它既不属于香港岛，也不属于九龙地区，而是位于两者之间，是分隔香港岛和九龙半岛的天然水域。它本身是一片水域，不属于任何一方的陆地。*#

“Across”的含义：短语 across the harbor from Hong Kong Island 描述的是从香港岛出发，越过港湾，到达对岸。因此，这个短语所指的目的地（即九龙城）位于九龙地区。

.案例

.这里为什么用了 had been 而不是 was?
这里使用 "had been"（过去完成时）而不是简单的 "was"（一般过去时），主要是为了在时间线上建立**“过去之中的过去”这种层次感，并强调事件的持续影响, 或定性**。

*had been (过去完成时)：像是在拍一部电影，导演先带你站在1860年代的香港，然后回过头去看更早发生的巴拉克拉瓦战役（1854年）。*

通过使用 had been，作者在暗示：当 1860 年代的英国人感到焦虑时，这场已经发生的、惨烈的战役（1854年）已经成了他们记忆中一个既定的、沉重的伤疤。 +

为什么 Balaklava 如此 Tragic？ +
文中所指的这场战役中，发生了著名的“轻骑兵冲锋” (Charge of the Light Brigade)。由于指挥官传达命令失误，英国精锐轻骑兵直接冲向了俄军密集的炮火阵地。 +

- 结果：短短几十分钟，六百多人冲锋，死伤过半，几乎全军覆没。 +
- 意义：这件事在当时被视为英军指挥极度无能的象征。这也是为什么作者要用 had been，因为在随后的十年里，这种“无能导致的惨剧”一直是英国精英阶层挥之不去的心病。

香港欧洲社群的这些担忧和恐惧反映了 19 世纪 50 年代中期至 60 年代中期大英帝国所处的危机和焦虑时期。从 1853 年末到 1856 年初，英国、法国和奥斯曼土耳其与俄罗斯在黑海的克里米亚半岛交战。尽管英国及其盟国最终取得了胜利，但双方的作战都极其糟糕，这场战争共造成约 50 万人丧生。对英国而言，1854 年 10 月的巴拉克拉瓦战役尤其惨痛。这场战役被英国诗人阿尔弗雷德·丁尼生勋爵写进了诗作《轻骑兵的冲锋》中，成为一段传奇。战役中，轻骑兵几乎损失了一半的兵力。克里米亚战争重新引发了人们对保卫英属印度的担忧，随后是 1856 年至 1857 年的波斯战争。在东南亚，1854 年新加坡华人暴动之后，槟城华人从 1857 年至 1867 年每年都发生暴动。1857 年，沙捞越也爆发了类似的华人暴动，1859 年至 1860 年，当地伊班族人发动了起义。1857 年，南非科萨族人发起了一场大规模的千禧年抗议活动，旨在将白人驱逐出该地区。许多英国政客和军方官员都对美国日益增长的实力感到担忧。 （尽管没有必要，香港殖民地财政大臣还是担心美国内战期间美国军舰的威胁，并要求增派驻军以保护殖民地。）一位历史学家认为，英国未能打开中国和拉丁美洲市场，甚至加剧了 1865 年牙买加莫兰特湾起义的残酷镇压，这一事件证实了英国种植园主对黑人起义由来已久的恐惧 。22 +

|在基督教传统中，撒旦原是上帝身边最美丽、最有权力的天使（路西法），但他因为傲慢而背叛了上帝，最终坠入地狱。

英国人一直把自己比作“文明的传播者”和“上帝的代理人”，而把印度人看作是受他们保护和恩惠的臣民。英国人看来，印度人的反抗不是“起义”，而是背叛。

|_The mark of a black skin_ was the mark of Cain 黑皮肤是该隐的烙印
|The Mark of Cain：在《圣经·创世纪》中，亚当的长子该隐, 因为嫉妒 杀死了弟弟亚伯。上帝在改隐额头上落下一个“烙印”，作为他杀亲罪行的标记，让他永远流浪。

这里将“黑色的皮肤”直接等同于圣经里罪犯该隐的“烙印”。 +

它传达了一种偏见——只要你皮肤是黑色的（指印度人），你生来就是卑鄙、残忍、注定会背叛的罪人。 +
这是一种**“贴标签”**的行为。英国人通过这个比喻告诉自己：“别再天真了，他们的肤色就是他们邪恶本质的证明，他们生来就是杀人犯。”

While there had been much enthusiasm in Britain for the Crimean War, the reaction toward the Indian uprising was one of shock and terror.  +
Some Britons denounced the barbaric execution of the rebels, but the rebellion seemed to disprove the naive yet widely held notion that British rule would keep imperial subjects content and obedient.  +
“To the British,” writes historian Ronald Hyam, “it seemed that Satan had rebelled and the mark of a black skin was the mark of Cain....  +
There had been one universal belief that no danger could ever approach the British in India, and that God was on the side of the empire and that everybody loved the British.”23 That Indian civilians had also been involved made things even worse.  +
A mutiny had expanded into a general rebellion, convincing many Britons that the Indians were no longer harmless and docile heathens but rather were treacherous and sinister savages.  +
Formerly loyal Indian friends and servants had suddenly—and seemingly inexplicably—become spies and murderers.
尽管英国对克里米亚战争热情高涨，但对印度起义的反应却是震惊和恐惧。一些英国人谴责对叛乱者的野蛮处决，但这场起义似乎推翻了英国统治能够使帝国臣民保持安宁顺从这一天真却又广为流传的观念。历史学家罗纳德·海厄姆写道：“对英国人来说，这仿佛是撒旦的叛乱，黑皮肤的印记就是该隐的印记……此前，人们普遍认为英国在印度永远不会面临任何危险，上帝站在帝国一边，人人都爱戴英国人。” 23 印度平民的参与更是雪上加霜。一场小规模兵变演变成一场全面叛乱，使许多英国人确信，印度人不再是温顺无害的异教徒，而是阴险狡诈的野蛮人。以前忠诚的印度朋友和仆人突然——而且似乎毫无缘由地——变成了间谍和杀人犯。 +

Understanding these events elsewhere in the world and the British Empire helps explain the tension and insecurity in Hong Kong throughout the 1850s and 1860s, especially during the Second Opium War and in late 1857 and early 1858 in particular.  +
Governor-General Ye ordered the Chinese of Hong Kong and Canton not to cooperate, offering rewards in silver for each English head delivered to him.  +
Placards on street corners throughout Canton and Hong Kong called on all loyal Chinese to rise up against the English barbarians by poisoning or stabbing them or by burning their property.  +
European factories in Canton were burned down; several European steamships were captured in Chinese waters, their passengers murdered; and in Hong Kong the buildings of several European firms were attacked, and a government official was strangled by one of his servants.
了解世界其他地区以及大英帝国境内发生的这些事件，有助于解释19世纪50年代和60年代香港的紧张局势和不安全局势，尤其是在第二次鸦片战争期间以及1857年末和1858年初。总督叶锦峰下令香港和广州的华人不得合作，并悬赏银子，奖励每人一人将其人头交给他。广州和香港街头巷尾的告示牌号召所有忠于英国的华人起来反抗英国蛮夷，可以通过毒杀、刺杀或焚烧他们的财产等方式进行报复。广州的欧洲商馆被烧毁；数艘欧洲轮船在中国水域被扣押，船上乘客惨遭杀害；在香港，数家欧洲公司的办公楼遭到袭击，一名政府官员被其仆人勒死。 +

In such an atmosphere, many Europeans in Hong Kong saw the bread-poisoning incident of January 15, 1857, as a direct response to Ye’s calls for Chinese in Hong Kong to attack their British colonizers.  +
That morning, several hundred Europeans, including the governor’s wife, Lady Bowring, had eaten bread baked by the E Sing Bakery and had become violently ill.  +
The offending ingredient was quickly determined to be arsenic.  +
As the amount of arsenic was so large, most of the Europeans had vomited it before digesting much of the poison.  +
But because the bakery was the only Western-style one remaining in the colony, Europeans saw the incident as a plot to wipe out their entire community.  +
Their fears appeared to be confirmed as the owner of the bakery, a comprador named Cheong Ah Lum, had left for Macau that morning with his family just before the Europeans had their breakfast.  +
Arrested and brought back for trial to Hong Kong, Cheong claimed that he and his family had also been poisoned after eating the same bread.
在这种氛围下，许多在港的欧洲人将1857年1月15日的面包中毒事件视为叶家明号召香港华人反抗英国殖民者的直接回应。当天早上，包括总督夫人鲍林夫人在内的数百名欧洲人食用了义胜面包店烘焙的面包后，立即出现剧烈呕吐。很快，毒物被确定为砒霜。由于砒霜含量极高，大多数欧洲人在消化掉大部分毒素之前就已呕吐。但由于义胜面包店是当时香港仅存的西式面包店，欧洲人认为这起事件是企图消灭他们整个社群的阴谋。他们的担忧似乎得到了证实，因为面包店老板张亚霖（一位买办）当天早上就带着家人前往澳门，而此时欧洲人正准备享用早餐。张亚霖被捕后押回香港受审，他声称自己和家人也是因为吃了同样的面包而中毒。 +
Although the bread-poisoning case is often held up as a shining example of impartial British justice, it was more of a test of British justice.  +
Some Europeans believed that there was not enough evidence to convict Cheong, but others wanted to lynch him and his employees.  +
Even the attorney general insisted that it would be “better to hang the wrong man than confess that British sagacity and activity have failed to discover the real criminals,” although Chief Justice John Walter Hulme, who had also been poisoned, warned that “hanging the wrong man will not further the ends of justice.” Represented by a British lawyer, Cheong was acquitted on lack of sufficient evidence, but 52 of his employees were imprisoned for four days in a small room, nicknamed the “Black Hole of Hong Kong” (after the “Black Hole of Calcutta,” a dungeon where 123 European prisoners had allegedly died in 1756).  +
Although 10 of the employees were tried, the remaining 42 were detained in the room for more than twenty days.  +
Only after protests from the European and Chinese communities were they released, on the condition that they leave Hong Kong.  +
Hundreds more Chinese were subsequently arrested and deported.
尽管面包中毒案常被视为英国公正司法的典范，但它更像是对英国司法的一次考验。一些欧洲人认为证据不足以定罪张，而另一些人则想将他和他的雇员处以私刑。就连总检察长也坚持认为，“与其承认英国的智慧和行动未能发现真正的罪犯，不如绞死无辜的人”，尽管同样中毒的首席大法官约翰·沃尔特·休姆警告说，“绞死无辜的人并不能伸张正义”。在英国律师的辩护下，张因证据不足而被判无罪，但他的52名雇员却被关押在一间狭小的房间里长达四天，这间房间被称为“香港黑洞”（仿照“加尔各答黑洞”，据称1756年有123名欧洲囚犯死于该地牢）。虽然有10名员工接受了审判，但其余42人被关押在房间里超过20天。在欧洲人和华人社区的抗议下，他们才被释放，但条件是离开香港。随后，又有数百名华人被捕并被驱逐出境。 +
Insufficient evidence exists of how this incident played out among the Chinese community of Hong Kong.  +
But all sorts of conflicting theories and questions arose among the European community.  +
Although a local English newspaper later suggested that the flour in the bread might have been contaminated on board a ship carrying arsenopyrite, there was good reason to believe that the poisoning had been deliberate, for some Chinese servants had warned their European employers about the plan.  +
Regardless, the case had revealed the tensions and suspicions in Hong Kong not just between the Chinese and Europeans but within the European community as well.  +
William Tarrant, a newspaper editor and former colonial official whose frequent attacks on the colonial government led to libel, fines, and even his imprisonment, sued Cheong for damages.  +
Although Tarrant was successful, Cheong left town again without paying up.  +
When Tarrant then accused the acting colonial secretary of letting Cheong escape, the acting colonial secretary in turn sued Tarrant for libel.  +
Tarrant lost, but his sympathizers came up with the compensation.  +
Small wonder, then, that the Times complained in March 1859 how “Hongkong is always connected with some fatal pestilence, some doubtful war, or some discreditable internal squabble, so much so that, in popular language, the name of this noisy, bustling, quarrelsome, disconnected little Island may not inaptly be used as a euphemous synonym for a place not mentionable to ears polite.”24
关于这起事件在香港华人社区内部的后续发展，目前尚无充分证据。但在欧洲人社区中，各种相互矛盾的理论和疑问层出不穷。尽管一家当地英文报纸后来提出，面包中的面粉可能是在一艘载有毒砂的船上被污染的，但人们有充分的理由相信投毒是蓄意的，因为一些中国佣人曾警告过他们的欧洲雇主这一计划。无论如何，这起事件揭示了香港的紧张局势和猜忌，不仅存在于华人与欧洲人之间，也存在于欧洲人社区内部。威廉·塔兰特是一位报纸编辑，也是一位前殖民地官员，他经常抨击殖民地政府，因此遭到诽谤、罚款甚至监禁。他起诉张某，要求赔偿损失。尽管塔兰特胜诉，但张某再次逃亡，并未支付赔偿金。之后，塔兰特指责代理殖民地大臣放走了张某，代理殖民地大臣反过来起诉塔兰特诽谤。塔兰特败诉，但他的支持者筹集了赔偿金。因此，难怪《泰晤士报》在 1859 年 3 月抱怨说：“香港总是与某种致命的瘟疫、某种来历不明的战争或某种不光彩的内部纷争联系在一起，以至于在通俗语言中，这个喧闹、熙攘、争吵不断、与世隔绝的小岛的名字，或许可以不恰当地用作一个不雅之物的委婉说法。” 24 +
This “doubtful war” achieved what the British had wanted: diplomatic recognition in Beijing, the opening of ten additional Chinese ports to international trade, and the legalization of opium.  +
The war also had several important effects on Hong Kong.  +
The colonial government issued a mass of emergency measures that practically put the colony’s Chinese residents under martial law, including curfews, deportations, and rewards for informants.  +
The government also granted the European community self-defense measures, such as erecting barricades, locking up Chinese servants at night, and allowing night sentries or patrolmen to shoot on sight any suspicious-looking Chinese.  +
Although many of these measures were later rescinded, some stayed on the books long after the war had ended.  +
For example, the night curfew for Chinese was not suspended until 1897, after protests in 1895 from some Chinese and Eurasian leaders, as a gesture of goodwill in honor of Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee.  +
Even then, the governor retained the right to reinstate the curfew.
这场“充满争议的战争”最终实现了英国的愿望：在北京获得外交承认，开放十个中国港口进行国际贸易，以及鸦片合法化。战争也对香港产生了诸多重要影响。殖民政府颁布了一系列紧急措施，实际上将香港的华人居民置于戒严状态，包括宵禁、驱逐出境以及悬赏缉拿告密者。政府还赋予了欧洲人一些自卫权，例如设置路障、夜间锁住华人佣人，以及允许夜间哨兵或巡逻人员对任何形迹可疑的华人开枪。尽管许多措施后来被废除，但有些措施在战后仍然有效。例如，华人宵禁直到1897年才被取消，此前一些华裔和欧亚裔领袖在1895年提出抗议，作为维多利亚女王登基六十周年庆典的友好姿态。即便如此，总督仍然保留着恢复宵禁的权力。 +
The war and the local tensions it provoked or exacerbated drew the European community together by making all Chinese in Hong Kong potential enemies.  +
As in many colonies, Europeans in Hong Kong had always worried about some sort of mass treachery through poisoning or uprising, although in Hong Kong they often convinced themselves that the number of Chinese who came to Hong Kong proved that colonial rule there was different than in other colonies.  +
Wang Tao, a Chinese scholar and journalist who came to Hong Kong during the Taiping Rebellion, noted with surprise how the colony’s reservoir was guarded by sentries to prevent its water supply from being poisoned.
战争及其引发或加剧的当地紧张局势，使得香港所有华人都成了潜在的敌人，从而将欧洲社群团结起来。如同许多殖民地一样，在香港的欧洲人始终担忧会发生某种大规模的阴谋，例如投毒或起义。尽管在香港，他们常常自欺欺人地认为，大量华人涌入香港证明，这里的殖民统治与其他殖民地有所不同。太平天国运动期间来到香港的中国学者兼记者王涛惊讶地发现，殖民地的水库竟然有哨兵把守，以防止水源被投毒。 +
Although they must have reinforced the Chinese community’s resentment of colonial rule, the effects of the Second Opium War and the emergency measures taken during the war on Hong Kong’s Chinese community are somewhat harder to characterize.  +
Partly in response to Governor-General Ye’s order to leave the colony, in early 1857 some five thousand Chinese left Hong Kong.  +
After Anglo-French forces occupied Canton in December 1857, many Chinese left Hong Kong from January 1858 through October 1861.  +
In July 1858 alone, some twenty thousand artisans, builders, laborers, and tailors left Hong Kong.  +
As historian Jung-fang Tsai has argued, however, antiforeignism “did not necessarily entail Chinese national consciousness.”25 Any attempts to attribute these mass departures to a sense of Chinese patriotism or loyalty to the Qing government are also complicated by the fact that the departures were not always voluntary.  +
For example, the exodus in July 1858 appears to have been partly a response to threats by magistrates in nearby Chinese villages who declared that if the Chinese in Hong Kong did not leave, their relatives in China would be punished as rebels.  +
Even in China, Ye’s prohibitions against food being exported to Hong Kong were rarely obeyed.  +
And the British encountered no significant resistance when they took over Kowloon Peninsula in January 1861.
尽管第二次鸦片战争及其期间采取的紧急措施无疑加剧了香港华人对殖民统治的不满，但这些措施对香港华人社区的影响却难以概括。部分原因是响应总督叶骊清下令离开殖民地，1857 年初，约有五千名华人离开香港。1857 年 12 月英法联军占领广州后，从 1858 年 1 月到 1861 年 10 月，又有许多华人离开香港。仅在 1858 年 7 月，就有约两万名工匠、建筑工人、劳工和裁缝离开香港。然而，正如历史学家蔡荣芳所论证的那样，排外情绪“并不一定意味着中国民族意识”。 25 此外，由于这些离开并非总是出于自愿，因此试图将这些大规模的离境归因于中国爱国主义或对清政府的忠诚也变得复杂起来。例如，1858 年 7 月的大规模迁徙似乎部分是由于附近中国村庄的官员威胁所致。这些官员宣称，如果香港的华人不离开，他们在中国的亲属将被当作叛乱分子惩罚。即使在中国，叶氏禁止向香港出口食品的禁令也鲜有人遵守。1861 年 1 月，英国占领九龙半岛时，也未遇到任何重大抵抗。 +
Many Chinese in fact collaborated actively with the British during the war.  +
For example, the wealthy brothers Li Sing and Li Leong, only recently arrived in Hong Kong, quickly sided with the British and French by providing money and porters.  +
For their efforts, the Li family received part of the war indemnity, including some pieces from the Imperial Summer Palace in Beijing.  +
Finally, Bowring, who was partly responsible for the war, enjoyed great popularity among some parts of the Chinese community.  +
When he left the colony in May 1859, the Western community ignored his departure.  +
The Chinese community, however, sent two deputations to see him off and showered him with praise and gifts.
事实上，许多华人在战争期间积极与英国合作。例如，刚到香港不久的富裕兄弟李星和李良，便迅速倒向英法联军，提供资金和搬运工。作为回报，李家获得了部分战争赔款，其中包括一些来自北京颐和园的文物。此外，对战争负有部分责任的鲍林在部分华人社区中享有很高的声望。1859年5月他离开香港时，西方社区对他的离去漠不关心。然而，华人社区却派出两支代表团送别他，并向他献上赞扬和礼物。 +
THE TAIPING REBELLION AND CHINESE EMIGRATION
太平天国运动与华人移民
Not only did many Chinese show their affiliation with Hong Kong by disobeying orders from Canton to return to China during the Second Opium War, but the local Chinese population also greatly expanded during this period.  +
And even though racial antagonisms and mutual suspicions between the Chinese and European populations increased during the war, the expansion of the Chinese community would eventually help make Hong Kong a major trading center.  +
This expansion occurred not because of the colonial government’s attempt to attract wealthier Chinese to Hong Kong but because of the combination of Chinese domestic turmoil and the worldwide rise of Western capitalism and imperialism, which encouraged Chinese emigration in two ways.
在第二次鸦片战争期间，许多华人不仅违抗广州的命令返回中国，以此表达他们对香港的认同，而且香港华人人口也在此期间大幅增长。尽管战争期间华人与欧洲人之间的种族敌对和相互猜忌加剧，但华人社区的扩张最终使香港成为重要的贸易中心。这种扩张并非殖民政府试图吸引富裕华人移居香港的结果，而是中国国内动荡局势与西方资本主义和帝国主义在全球范围内的崛起共同作用的结果，这从两个方面促进了华人移民。 +
The opening of Canton and other treaty ports by the Treaty of Nanking disrupted local economies.  +
Imports such as British cotton now competed with Chinese products in the markets of Canton, while Chinese junks lost out to larger, faster foreign vessels.  +
By the late 1840s and early 1850s, Canton had lost its hold on both tea and silk trades, causing unemployment throughout Guangdong.  +
Almost simultaneously, the abandonment of slavery by England, France, and some parts of the United States encouraged a demand for cheap, forced labor in Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and the West and East Indies.  +
In 1849 after gold was discovered in California, the first shipload of Chinese laborers came through Hong Kong, en route to the United States.  +
By December 1850, two thousand Chinese had left China for California.  +
Between January and June 1850, some ten thousand tons of shipping were loaded or partly loaded in Hong Kong and shipped to the western coast of the United States.  +
With this growth of overseas trade also came new Chinese labor and talent.  +
In 1850, Governor Bonham reported an increase in the Chinese population, mainly artisans from Canton working in the California trade.  +
Three years later he noted that the colony’s “commercial prospects are slowly but certainly extending and assuming a character of greater permanency.”
《南京条约》开放广州及其他通商口岸，扰乱了当地经济。英国棉花等进口商品开始与中国产品在广州市场展开竞争，而中国帆船则败给了更大、更快的外国船只。到19世纪40年代末50年代初，广州失去了对茶叶和丝绸贸易的控制权，导致广东各地失业率居高不下。几乎与此同时，英国、法国和美国部分地区废除奴隶制，刺激了加拿大、美国、澳大利亚、新西兰以及西印度群岛和东印度群岛对廉价强迫劳动力的需求。1849年加利福尼亚发现金矿后，第一批中国劳工经香港前往美国。到1850年12月，已有两千名中国人离开中国前往加利福尼亚。1850年1月至6月间，约一万吨货物在香港装船或部分装船，运往美国西海岸。随着海外贸易的增长，也带来了新的中国劳动力和人才。 1850年，邦纳姆总督报告说，华人人口有所增加，主要是来自广州的工匠，他们在加利福尼亚从事贸易。三年后，他指出，该殖民地的“商业前景正在缓慢但稳步地扩展，并呈现出更加持久的特征”。 +
Hong Kong’s economic recovery began in the early 1850s, when many Chinese merchants came to Hong Kong to escape the Taiping Rebellion.  +
In 1837, Hong Xiuquan, a Chinese from Guangdong who had failed the civil service examination, had a nervous breakdown.  +
Years later, after failing the examination a fourth time and reading Christian tracts produced by Protestant missionaries, he became convinced that he was the second son of Jehovah and the younger brother of Jesus Christ.  +
He had been ordered to oust the Manchu “imps and demons” from China and to establish the Taiping Kingdom, or “Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace.” When Hong and his Society of God Worshippers started proselytizing in Guangxi province, an area outside of government control and teeming with secret societies that claimed their loyalty to the Ming dynasty, their crusade gained a political edge.  +
Armed with an ideology based on quasi-Christian beliefs, the abolition of private property and the institution of a communal land system, the segregation of men and women, and strict prohibitions against liquor, tobacco, and opium, Hong’s rebels moved northeast from Guangxi and through the middle Yangzi Valley.  +
In 1853 they captured Nanjing, renaming the city the “Heavenly Capital” and making it their capital for more than ten years.  +
The rebellion might have ended the Qing dynasty were it not eventually suppressed in 1864 by provincial armies led by Chinese commanders, along with help from Western munitions and mercenaries.
香港的经济复苏始于19世纪50年代初，当时许多中国商人为了躲避太平天国运动而来到香港。1837年，一位名叫洪秀全的广东人，因科举落榜而精神崩溃。多年后，他第四次科举落榜，并阅读了基督教传教士制作的小册子，深信自己是耶和华的次子，耶稣基督的弟弟。他奉命将满清的“妖魔鬼怪”驱逐出中国，建立太平天国，即“天国大和平”。当洪秀全和他的“神敬会”开始在广西传教时，由于广西当时处于政府控制之外，且充斥着许多自称效忠明朝的秘密社团，他们的传教活动逐渐获得了政治意义。洪氏起义军以准基督教信仰为基础，主张废除私有财产，建立公有土地制度，实行男女隔离，并严格禁止酒、烟、鸦片等消费。他们从广西出发，向东北方向进发，途经长江中游。1853年，他们攻占南京，将这座城市改名为“天都”，并以此为都城长达十余年。若非最终在1864年被中国将领率领的地方军队，以及西方军火和雇佣兵的援助镇压，这场起义或许会终结清朝的统治。 +
The Taiping Rebellion and its suppression cost at least twenty million lives, devastated parts of the Chinese countryside, and wiped out entire cities.  +
Those who could afford to do so fled to the safety of the treaty ports, especially to Shanghai, protected by its large Western settlement.  +
Although the rebellion fueled tensions in Hong Kong, it also helped pull the colony out of its economic slump.  +
From 1853 to 1859 the Chinese population of Hong Kong rose from approximately forty thousand to around eighty-five thousand, even with the mass departures during the Second Opium War.  +
Officials and visitors often commented on how the turbulent conditions in China had brought new traders to the colony and improved living standards.  +
When journalist Wang Tao first arrived in Hong Kong, “merchants generally wore short jackets and put on a cotton overcoat when the weather got cold.  +
The women paid little attention to their dress.” But he later observed that “drastic changes are now taking place in the way of life in Hong Kong.  +
People are beginning to pursue luxury....  +
Bright lamps burn through the night, and loud music is heard until the small hours.  +
Hong Kong’s prosperity now exceeds that of Canton, and it is all the result of fate and chance.”26
太平天国运动及其镇压造成至少两千万人丧生，摧毁了中国部分乡村，并夷平了整座城市。有能力的人纷纷逃往通商口岸寻求庇护，尤其是受西部商站保护的上海。尽管太平天国运动加剧了香港的紧张局势，但也帮助香港摆脱了经济衰退。1853 年至 1859 年间，香港的华人人口从约四万人增长到约八万五千人，即便是在第二次鸦片战争期间经历了大规模人口外流之后，这一数字依然保持稳定。官员和来访者经常提到，中国动荡的局势为香港带来了新的商人，并提高了当地居民的生活水平。记者王涛初到香港时，“商人们通常穿着短袄，天气转凉时才穿上棉袄。妇女们则不太注重穿着打扮。”但他后来观察到，“香港的生活方式正在发生剧烈的变化。人们开始追求奢华……灯火通明，音乐声响彻夜空。香港的繁荣程度如今超过了广州，而这一切都是命运和机遇的结果。” 26 +
The combination of the Taiping Rebellion, Chinese emigration, and the growth of overseas Chinese communities had three important effects on Hong Kong’s economy.  +
It transformed Hong Kong from a colonial outpost into the center of a transnational overseas Chinese trade network stretching from the China coast to Southeast Asia and all the way to Australia and the Americas.  +
The rebellion and the rise of overseas Chinese communities also created a new class of wealthy Chinese in Hong Kong, where they became settlers rather than sojourners.  +
Among these new immigrants were wealthy Chinese who brought their families, capital, entrepreneurial skills, and business connections.  +
Examples include the Li brothers, who came from Guangdong during the early 1850s.  +
In 1857 the brothers became the largest brokers of immigrant labor and charterers of immigrant ships.  +
By the mid-1860s, their family holdings included insurance, real estate, and interests in the opium monopoly.  +
As head of this successful family, Li Sing became one of the colony’s most prominent merchants.  +
With the arrival of such men, a new Chinese business elite had emerged in Hong Kong colony by the late 1850s.
太平天国运动、华人移民潮以及海外华人社区的壮大，对香港经济产生了三大重要影响。首先，它将香港从一个殖民地前哨转变为一个跨国华人贸易网络的中心，该网络从中国沿海延伸至东南亚，甚至远至澳大利亚和美洲。其次，太平天国运动和海外华人社区的兴起，也催生了香港一个新的富裕阶层，他们不再是过客，而是定居者。这些新移民中不乏富裕的华人，他们带来了家人、资本、商业技能和人脉。例如，李氏兄弟于19世纪50年代初从广东来到香港。1857年，他们成为最大的劳工中介和移民船承租人。到19世纪60年代中期，他们的家族产业涵盖保险、房地产以及鸦片垄断。作为这个成功家族的掌门人，李星成为香港最杰出的商人之一。随着这些人的到来，到 19 世纪 50 年代末，香港殖民地出现了一个新的华人商业精英阶层。 +
Finally, Hong Kong’s economic growth benefited local European merchants and attracted new foreign investment.  +
Several new European banks were opened in the late 1850s and early 1860s.  +
American and Portuguese firms moved from Canton and Macau.  +
In 1857 Douglas Lapraik, a Scot who had begun his Hong Kong career as a watchmaker’s apprentice, cofounded Hong Kong’s first dry dock.  +
By the time of his death in 1869, he owned a fleet of seven steamships.  +
Shipping between Hong Kong and Canton and the United States and Australia also increased.  +
The clearest indicator of foreign investors’ new confidence in the colony’s economy can be seen in the founding of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank in July 1864.  +
Until then, local banking services for foreign merchants had been provided by larger European hongs.  +
Most of the Western banks in Hong Kong and China were branch offices of Anglo-Indian banks such as the Oriental Bank and the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China—exchange banks controlled from India or England.  +
The founding of the new bank was heralded as a sign of the colony’s prosperity.  +
Chinese capital was important from the start, and the bank would become the leading bank on the China coast.  +
In the absence of any formal central bank, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank would act as Hong Kong’s central bank until the last years of the colonial era.  +
By the late twentieth century, it had become one of the largest financial institutions in the world.
最终，香港的经济增长惠及了当地的欧洲商人，并吸引了新的外国投资。19 世纪 50 年代末至 60 年代初，多家新的欧洲银行相继成立。美国和葡萄牙公司也从广州和澳门迁至香港。1857 年，苏格兰人道格拉斯·拉普雷克（Douglas Lapraik）在香港以钟表匠学徒的身份起家，后来与人合伙创办了香港第一家干船坞。到 1869 年去世时，他已拥有七艘蒸汽船。香港与广州、美国和澳大利亚之间的航运也日益繁忙。1864 年 7 月香港上海汇丰银行的成立，最能体现外国投资者对香港经济信心的增强。在此之前，香港的银行业务主要由规模较大的欧洲银行提供。当时，香港和中国的大多数西方银行都是英印银行的分支机构，例如东方银行和印度、澳大利亚和中国特许银行——这些汇兑银行由印度或英国控制。新银行的成立被视为殖民地繁荣的标志。中国资本从一开始就至关重要，这家银行也很快发展成为中国沿海地区首屈一指的银行。由于当时香港没有正式的中央银行，香港上海汇丰银行在殖民时代的最后几年里一直扮演着香港中央银行的角色。到 20 世纪末，它已成为世界上最大的金融机构之一。 +
