A New Hong Kong  新香港
The establishment of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949 gave Hong Kong new prominence, both in the British Empire and across the globe.  +
Despite the Communists’ insistence that they had no interest in recovering Hong Kong, many British officials assumed that Hong Kong would eventually have to be surrendered to China.  +
Instead, the Communist revolution brought new labor, capital, and energy to Hong Kong.  +
As Wm.  +
Roger Louis, a leading historian of the British Empire, writes, when the Communists took control of Shanghai, China’s economic center, in late 1949, the British realized that “they were witnessing in Hong Kong a demographic as well as an economic revolution that would have profound consequences for the people of the colony and perhaps for the British Empire.”1 From 1946 to the mid-1950s, approximately 1 million people came to Hong Kong from China—an average of almost three hundred people per day.  +
While in May 1950 the colonial government limited the number of Chinese from the mainland, by the end of the year the influx had increased Hong Kong’s population to almost 2 million.  +
And although in February 1951 the Chinese government began to control migration to Guangdong, which in turn lowered immigration to Hong Kong, by 1955 the colony’s population was around 2.5 million.
1949 年中华人民共和国的成立使香港在英帝国乃至全球范围内都获得了新的地位。尽管共产党坚称无意收复香港，但许多英国官员仍认为香港最终必然会归还中国。然而，共产党的革命却为香港带来了新的劳动力、资本和活力。正如英国历史学家威廉·罗杰·路易斯所写，当共产党在 1949 年末控制了中国的经济中心上海时，英国人意识到“他们正在香港见证一场人口和经济的双重革命，这场革命将对殖民地人民乃至整个英帝国产生深远的影响。” ¹ 从 1946 年到 20 世纪 50 年代中期，约有 100 万人从中国大陆来到香港——平均每天近 300 人。 1950 年 5 月，殖民地政府限制了来自中国大陆的移民数量，但到年底，涌入的人口已使香港人口增至近 200 万。1951 年 2 月，中国政府开始控制向广东的移民，这反过来又减少了向香港的移民，但到 1955 年，香港的人口仍约为 250 万。 +



THE KOREAN WAR AND THE COLD WAR
朝鲜战争与冷战
With the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, Hong Kong became a “reluctant Cold Warrior.”2 Needing American help to maintain its world-power status, Britain wanted to show the United States that it was a loyal and reliable ally, but it also had to keep a low profile to avoid provoking the PRC.  +
At the same time, Britain had to protect its interests in China and preserve control over Hong Kong.  +
Britain was less concerned about a direct attack by the PRC than about the prospect of Hong Kong being hurt if hostilities between China and America arose over Indochina, Korea, or Taiwan.  +
The British realized that Hong Kong would be indefensible against an invasion by the PRC—however unlikely—but they were also worried about what they referred to as “the American threat.” The United States needed allies to contain China, and Hong Kong was the ideal place for gathering intelligence, spreading propaganda, and organizing covert action against China.  +
But the British worried that working too closely with the United States and allowing it too much leeway in Hong Kong would provoke the PRC into stirring up trouble in Hong Kong or attacking the colony if war broke out with the United States.
1950 年朝鲜战争爆发后，香港成为了“不情愿的冷战战士”。 2.  +
为了维持其世界强国地位，英国需要美国的帮助。英国希望向美国表明自己是忠诚可靠的盟友，但同时也必须保持低调，避免激怒中华人民共和国。与此同时，英国必须保护其在中国的利益，并维持对香港的控制。英国与其说是担心中华人民共和国直接攻击香港，不如说是担心如果中美因印度支那、朝鲜或台湾问题爆发冲突，香港会受到牵连。英国人意识到，香港几乎无法抵御中华人民共和国的入侵——尽管这种可能性很小——但他们也担忧所谓的“美国威胁”。美国需要盟友来遏制中国，而香港是收集情报、散布宣传和组织针对中国的秘密行动的理想场所。但英国担心，与美国合作过于密切，并给予美国在香港过大的自由裁量权，会激怒中华人民共和国，使其在香港制造事端，或者在与美国开战时攻击香港。 +



Despite America’s historical interest in Hong Kong, by World War II the United States had attached little importance to Hong Kong.  +
American exports to Hong Kong were marginal, and the region appeared to have little military value.  +
The establishment of the PRC and the outbreak of the Korean War, however, forced the United States to reconsider Hong Kong’s strategic value.  +
And with the escalation of the Cold War, America saw the potential of using existing and former colonies to help contain Communism.  +
With its proximity to China, good British facilities (including signals-intelligence posts), and supply of local Chinese talent, Hong Kong was a perfect base for intelligence gathering and China-watching.  +
In late 1949 the Central Intelligence Agency established a listening post attached to the American consulate.  +
When President Harry Truman closed the American embassy and consulates in China during the winter of 1949–1950, consular and reporting work shifted to Hong Kong.  +
Thus, by the 1950s this consulate had a larger staff than any other American consulate in the world.  +
Hong Kong also played an important role in American psychological warfare against China.  +
The U.S.  +
Information Service in Hong Kong produced anti-Communist magazines, such as America Today and Four Seas, and a variety of brochures and pamphlets.  +
The colony was a popular rest and recreation destination for the U.S.  +
Navy, as it would be during the Vietnam War.  +
Governor Alexander Grantham recalled how the Chinese government “constantly used this as a propaganda theme; claiming that it proved that Hong Kong was a base for American imperialism, and that Britain was a stooge of the United States.”3
尽管美国历史上对香港抱有浓厚的兴趣，但在二战期间，美国对香港的重视程度并不高。美国对香港的出口微乎其微，该地区似乎也缺乏军事价值。然而，中华人民共和国的成立和朝鲜战争的爆发迫使美国重新审视香港的战略价值。随着冷战的升级，美国看到了利用现有和前殖民地遏制共产主义的潜力。香港毗邻中国，拥有完善的英国设施（包括信号情报站）以及丰富的本地人才，使其成为情报收集和监视中国的理想基地。1949 年末，中央情报局在美国领事馆设立了一个监听站。1949 年至 1950 年冬季，杜鲁门总统关闭了美国驻华大使馆和领事馆，领事和情报工作转移到了香港。因此，到了 20 世纪 50 年代，香港领事馆的人员规模超过了世界上任何其他美国领事馆。香港在美国对华心理战中也扮演了重要角色。美国驻港新闻处出版了 《今日美国》 和 《四海》等反共杂志， 以及各种宣传册和小册子。香港是美国海军的热门休憩娱乐场所，越战期间亦是如此。总督亚历山大·格兰瑟姆回忆说，中国政府“不断以此为宣传主题，声称这证明香港是美国帝国主义的基地，而英国是美国的傀儡。” ³ +
Ironically, the greatest threat to Hong Kong’s economy in the years after the 1949 revolution came not from the Chinese Communists but rather from the United States—the country most determined to contain the spread of Communism.  +
Although Hong Kong drew some economic benefits from supporting British military operations in Korea, the colony’s economy suffered from two embargoes: the United Nations (UN) embargo on strategic goods, imposed on China for intervening in the Korean War, and the American embargo on any trade with China.  +
The British government also limited exports to China and Hong Kong, but it was the American embargo inspectors who often took to extremes their orders to ensure that no Chinese goods found their way through Hong Kong into the United States.  +
“The classic example,” explained Grantham, “is that of dried ducks.  +
These ducks were processed in Hong Kong and then exported to America.  +
Many of them came from eggs laid in China and brought to Hong Kong to hatch.  +
Were the ducks from these eggs communist ducks or true-blue British ducks? The correspondence on the subject was voluminous before a solution was finally reached.  +
Provided that an inspector was present when the duck was hatched, that he forthwith rubber-stamped the duckling’s foot, and that on reaching maturity a further marking was put on the duck, then the ducks might be slaughtered, dried and admitted into the United States.”4 Shrimps, notes author Frank Welsh, faced a similar predicament.  +
They “might be caught in the admissible waters of Hong Kong, but had the crustaceans begun their lives there, or were they Communist infiltrators? In the absence of unequivocal evidence all shrimps, therefore, were banned.”5
具有讽刺意味的是，1949 年革命后香港经济面临的最大威胁并非来自中国共产党，而是来自美国——这个决心遏制共产主义扩张的国家。尽管香港从支持英国在朝鲜的军事行动中获得了一些经济利益，但这个殖民地的经济却遭受了两项禁运：一是联合国因中国干预朝鲜战争而对中国实施的战略物资禁运；二是美国对中国的一切贸易禁运。英国政府也限制了对中国内地和香港的出口，但正是美国的禁运检查员经常采取极端手段，确保没有中国商品能够通过香港流入美国。格兰瑟姆解释说：“最经典的例子就是鸭干。这些鸭子在香港加工后出口到美国。其中许多鸭蛋产自中国，然后运到香港孵化。这些鸭子究竟是共产主义鸭还是纯正的英国鸭？围绕这个问题，人们进行了大量的通信，最终才找到解决方案。只要鸭子孵化时有检查员在场，检查员立即在鸭子的脚上盖上橡皮图章，并在鸭子长大后再加盖一个标记，这些鸭子就可以被宰杀、晒干并进口到美国。” 4 作家弗兰克·韦尔什指出，虾也面临着类似的困境。它们“可能是在香港的合法水域捕捞的，但这些甲壳类动物是在那里出生的，还是共产主义渗透者？由于缺乏确凿的证据，所有虾都被禁止进口。” 5 +
As the Cold War tensions escalated, Hong Kong became known as the “Berlin of the East.” Created partly by British policymakers to draw international support, this analogy obscured the fact that Hong Kong’s survival depended on working out a good relationship with the PRC (especially the authorities in Guangdong) rather than alienating it.  +
The Hong Kong government adopted a very pragmatic policy regarding the PRC during the Korean War and throughout the Cold War.  +
Like the PRC, it simply ignored the issue of Hong Kong’s political status.  +
Hong Kong proved of great use to the PRC during the Korean War, when scarce goods such as gas, kerosene, and penicillin were smuggled in during the embargoes, as were remittances from overseas Chinese.  +
Many residents in the New Territories benefited from the embargoes by smuggling goods into China.  +
Cheung Yan Lung, a local community leader, recalled how “whatever could be sold in China was smuggled by truck or ship.  +
On a dark, moonless night the beach at Kat O often resembled how I imagine a smugglers’ cove in eighteenth-century England would have looked, with small boats, men with lanterns, and piles of goods!”6
随着冷战局势升级，香港被称为“东方柏林”。这一比喻部分是英国决策者为了争取国际支持而提出的，但它掩盖了一个事实：香港的生存取决于与中华人民共和国（尤其是广东省当局）建立良好关系，而不是疏远它。在朝鲜战争和整个冷战期间，香港政府对中华人民共和国采取了非常务实的政策。与中华人民共和国一样，香港政府也对香港的政治地位问题置之不理。在朝鲜战争期间，香港对中华人民共和国发挥了巨大作用，当时禁运期间，汽油、煤油和青霉素等稀缺物资以及海外华人汇款都被走私到中国。许多新界居民通过向中国走私货物而从禁运中获益。当地社区领袖张彦龙回忆说：“凡是在中国能卖的东西，都会用卡车或船走私过来。在漆黑无月的夜晚，吉澳海滩常常就像我想象中十八世纪英国走私者的藏身之处一样，停泊着小船，提着灯笼的人，还有成堆的货物！” 6 +
Nor did the Berlin of the East analogy necessarily imply agreement between Britain and the United States toward China and Hong Kong.  +
While Britain officially recognized the new PRC on January 6, 1950, America continued to recognize Chiang Kai-shek’s government on Taiwan, the Republic of China.  +
An incident of late 1949 shows how the Hong Kong government found itself having to balance its relations with the governments of Britain, China, and the United States.  +
In December, a dispute arose between Britain and China over Chinese state properties and the assets of the China National Aviation Corporation and the Central Air Transport Incorporation (co-owned by American flying ace Claire Chennault, founder of the legendary Flying Tigers in China during World War II), both of which had been transferred to Hong Kong for safety during the civil war.  +
The Nationalist government asked the Hong Kong government to impound the airplanes so they would not be sent to the PRC, where they might be used to invade Taiwan, but before the British government responded, Nationalist agents in Hong Kong bombed seven of the airplanes.  +
To further complicate matters, the American government asked the British embassy in Washington if the Hong Kong government could keep the remaining planes from falling into the hands of the Chinese Communists.
“东方柏林”的比喻也并不一定意味着英国和美国在对待中国和香港的问题上达成一致。尽管英国于1950年1月6日正式承认中华人民共和国，但美国仍然承认蒋介石在台湾的政权，即中华民国。1949年末发生的一件事表明，香港政府不得不努力平衡与英国、中国和美国三国政府的关系。同年12月，英国和中国就中国国有财产以及中国国家航空公司和中央航空运输公司（由美国飞行王牌克莱尔·陈纳德共同拥有，他是二战期间在中国创建传奇飞虎队的创始人）的资产发生争端。这两家公司在内战期间为了安全起见被转移到了香港。国民党政府要求香港政府扣押这些飞机，以免它们被送往中华人民共和国，用于入侵台湾。但在英国政府做出回应之前，国民党在香港的特工炸毁了其中七架飞机。更复杂的是，美国政府询问英国驻华盛顿大使馆，香港政府能否阻止剩余的飞机落入中国共产党手中。 +



When the Hong Kong chief justice ruled in April 1950 that the airplanes belonged to the new PRC government, the U.S.  +
State Department pressured the British government to intervene.  +
Fully aware of the implications of the issue for Sino-British relations, the British worried that not releasing the airplanes might cause the PRC to organize strikes, riots, and sabotage in Hong Kong or to impose an economic embargo.  +
On the other hand, giving the airplanes to the PRC would hurt relations with the United States.  +
Warning that the airplanes could be used to attack not just Taiwan but Japan and Southeast Asia and accusing Britain of helping the spread of Communism, vocal American senators and congressmen threatened to withhold support for programs that provided economic assistance to Britain.  +
Although the British government tried hard to avoid any appearance of being under American pressure, in June 1952 the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ruled that the airplanes were the legal property of Central Air Transport but should not be transferred to Taiwan.  +
The airplanes were eventually sold as scrap metals and spare parts by their legal owners.
1950年4月，香港首席大法官裁定这些飞机属于新成立的中华人民共和国政府所有。美国国务院随即向英国政府施压，要求其介入此事。英国方面深知此事对中英关系的影响，担心若不归还飞机，中华人民共和国政府可能会在香港组织罢工、暴乱和破坏活动，甚至实施经济封锁。另一方面，将飞机交给中华人民共和国政府又会损害英美关系。一些美国参议员和众议员警告说，这些飞机不仅可能被用来攻击台湾，还可能被用来攻击日本和东南亚，并指责英国助长共产主义的传播。他们威胁要停止对英国提供经济援助的项目的支持。尽管英国政府竭力避免给人留下受到美国施压的印象，但1952年6月，枢密院司法委员会裁定，这些飞机是中央航空运输公司的合法财产，但不应移交给台湾。这些飞机最终被其合法所有者作为废金属和零部件出售。 +



THE POSTWAR ECONOMIC BOOM
战后经济繁荣
To Hong Kong officials, the American and UN embargoes often seemed to be aimed at hurting Hong Kong’s economy, but they were “a boon in disguise.” 7 The embargoes forced Hong Kong to shift from entrepôt trade to manufacturing, without which Hong Kong might never have attained its level of economic prosperity after the war.  +
This new emphasis on light industrialization was not the result of any action taken by the colonial government, which in fact continued to view industry with some skepticism while continuing to stress Hong Kong’s status as a trading port.  +
Rather, the initiative came from local Chinese entrepreneurs, who realized that while smuggling goods into China under the embargoes could be highly lucrative it was risky and unreliable, and from the influx of Chinese entrepreneurs from the mainland.
在香港官员看来，美国和联合国的禁运似乎往往是为了损害香港经济，但实际上却是“因祸得福”。 7.  +
禁运迫使香港从转口贸易转向制造业，否则香港战后或许无法达到如此繁荣的经济水平。这种对轻工业化的新重视并非殖民政府采取的任何行动的结果，事实上，殖民政府在继续强调香港作为贸易港口地位的同时，仍然对工业抱有一定的怀疑态度。相反，这一举措来自本地华人企业家，他们意识到，尽管在禁运期间走私货物到中国内地利润丰厚，但风险极高且不可靠；此外，来自大陆的华人企业家的涌入也起到了推波助澜的作用。 +



The Chinese of Hong Kong, whether long-term residents or recent immigrants, were most responsible for Hong Kong’s post-1949 industrial boom, both as producers and consumers.  +
But Hong Kong’s colonial status also played an important role in this remarkable economic transformation, as did some of the factors that had shaped Hong Kong’s economic development since it became a British colony: its economic and political stability, deep harbor and good port, and steady supply of cheap labor from China.  +
Whereas in 1953 only 30 percent of Hong Kong’s exports were produced locally, by 1959 this proportion had risen to 70 percent, with the colony producing and exporting a wide variety of manufactured goods such as textiles and clothing, plastic toys and flowers, flashlights and batteries, and aluminum, enamel, and rattan ware.  +
Nor could this rapid industrialization have occurred without the trading and banking networks built up over the previous century.  +
Chinese industrialists relied heavily on loans from British banks, which enjoyed the favor of the colonial regime.  +
And whereas historians have generally assumed that Hong Kong’s rise to a regional financial center began in the late 1960s and early 1970s, economic historian Catherine Schenk argues that this rise actually began in the 1950s, when Hong Kong was “profoundly affected” by its position in the international monetary system and by its colonial status.  +
According to Schenk, the colonial monetary system provided currency stability in the increasingly regulated international system that developed in the postwar period.8 Hong Kong’s status as both a British colony and an Asian entrepôt thus laid the foundation for its emergence as an international financial center, while the political instability in other parts of East Asia increased Hong Kong’s economic competitiveness.
香港华人，无论是长期居民还是新移民，都是 1949 年后香港工业繁荣的主要推动者，他们既是生产者也是消费者。但香港的殖民地地位也在这一非凡的经济转型中发挥了重要作用，其他一些因素也同样影响着香港自成为英国殖民地以来的经济发展：经济和政治的稳定、深水良港以及来自中国内地的廉价劳动力供应。1953 年，香港出口产品中只有 30%是本地生产的，而到 1959 年，这一比例上升至 70%，香港生产和出口的制成品种类繁多，包括纺织品和服装、塑料玩具和花卉、手电筒和电池，以及铝制品、搪瓷制品和藤制品。如果没有上个世纪建立起来的贸易和银行网络，这种快速的工业化也不可能发生。中国实业家严重依赖英国银行的贷款，而这些银行也深受殖民政权的青睐。尽管历史学家普遍认为香港崛起为区域金融中心始于 20 世纪 60 年代末 70 年代初，但经济史学家凯瑟琳·申克（Catherine Schenk）认为，这一崛起实际上始于 20 世纪 50 年代，当时香港深受其在国际货币体系中的地位及其殖民地地位的影响。申克指出，在战后时期日益规范化的国际体系中，殖民地货币体系为香港提供了货币稳定性。8 香港作为英国殖民地和亚洲转口港的地位，为其成为国际金融中心奠定了基础，而东亚其他地区的政治不稳定则提高了香港的经济竞争力。 +



COPING IN THE NEW WORLD ORDER
如何在新世界秩序中应对
By the late 1950s, Hong Kong had resumed its stature as one of the busiest ports in the world.  +
Its economy had become even more industrialized.  +
However, Hong Kong had lost any real strategic importance for Britain, whose territorial interests in Asia disappeared with the independence of India, Burma, Malaya, and most of the other former British colonies in the region.  +
The Hong Kong garrison was reduced to a minimal level, and the naval dockyard was closed.  +
In October 1957, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and President Dwight Eisenhower secretly agreed that in return for Britain’s promise—at least for the time being—not to push for China’s admission to the UN, the United States would help defend Hong Kong in case of an attack by China.
到了20世纪50年代末，香港已恢复了其作为世界最繁忙港口之一的地位，经济也更加工业化。然而，随着印度、缅甸、马来亚以及该地区大多数其他前英国殖民地的独立，英国在亚洲的领土利益也随之消失，香港对英国而言已失去了任何真正的战略意义。香港驻军被削减至最低限度，海军船坞也被关闭。1957年10月，英国首相哈罗德·麦克米伦和美国总统德怀特·艾森豪威尔秘密达成协议：作为交换，英国承诺——至少暂时——不推动中国加入联合国，而美国将在香港遭受中国攻击时协助保卫香港。 +



The 1950s were nevertheless critical years for Hong Kong.  +
Many of the refugees from China lived in squatter areas nestled in the hillside, without water or electricity and at the risk of fires and mud slides.  +
Elsie Tu (formerly Elsie Elliot), a British educator, social activist, and former member of the Legislative Council who arrived in Hong Kong in 1951 as a missionary and lived among the squatters, recalls how hard life could be for these refugee families, in which many of the women were embroiderers.  +
Even though they worked “from dawn to dusk,” these women “could not earn enough to feed one person.  +
Father had to work at another job, and the children had to earn their coppers if the family was to eat at all.  +
They used only small oil lamps in those huts and could scarcely work after dark, so they would sit at their doorways to catch the last ray of light, straining their eyes over the fine silk strands.” Some of the women “were near blind at forty years of age.” Even young children “sat for all those hours trying to earn their rice....  +
Most of the children, even the tiniest babies, suffered from enormous boils and skin infections, due to malnutrition and hot, sticky living conditions.”9
然而，20 世纪 50 年代对香港而言却是至关重要的时期。许多来自中国的难民居住在山坡上的棚户区，那里没有水电，还面临着火灾和泥石流的威胁。英国教育家、社会活动家、前立法会议员杜艾尔西（原名艾尔西·艾略特）于 1951 年以传教士的身份来到香港，并与棚户区居民一起生活。她回忆起这些难民家庭的生活有多么艰难，其中许多妇女都是刺绣工。尽管她们“从早到晚”辛勤劳作，却“挣不到足够的钱养活一家人。父亲不得不另谋生路，孩子们也必须挣钱，一家人才能有饭吃。她们在棚屋里只能使用小油灯，天黑后几乎无法继续工作，只能坐在门口，抓住最后一缕光线，眯着眼睛仔细地绣着细密的丝线。”有些妇女“四十岁时几乎失明”。就连年幼的孩子“也得长时间坐着挣钱……大多数孩子，甚至最小的婴儿，都因为营养不良和闷热潮湿的生活环境而患有巨大的疖子和皮肤感染。” 9 +
It has become commonplace to assume that the colonial government did not respond to the problem of these squatter areas until a massive fire on December 24, 1953, in Shek Kip Mei, Kowloon, left homeless more than fifty-eight thousand people and prompted the government to construct multistory “resettlement estates.” As anthropologist Alan Smart argues, however, the government’s response to the Shek Kip Mei disaster did not represent a radical break from earlier policies toward resettlement.  +
Contrary to the “Shek Kip Mei myth,” the colonial government had in fact begun substantial efforts to resettle squatters in 1952, mainly because it feared that Hong Kong’s vulnerable geopolitical position could be disrupted by civil disturbances following squatter fires and because squatter sites not only posed serious health and safety risks but also threatened government land revenues.10 Taking a slightly different approach yet also underscoring the strategic purpose of these resettlement efforts, historian David Faure argues that Shek Kip Mei provided an ideal excuse for the colonial government, which, under pressure from the Colonial Office, had wanted to introduce public housing earlier but faced opposition from the Chinese elite.11 Regardless, the government’s public housing scheme developed into a massive resettlement program run by the new Resettlement Department and accompanied by an expansion of education and medical services.  +
The British, Chinese, and American governments all contributed to the housing scheme, once again showing Hong Kong’s new geopolitical position.
人们普遍认为，直到 1953 年 12 月 24 日九龙石硖尾发生大火，导致超过 5.8 万人无家可归，并促使政府兴建多层“安置屋”之后，殖民政府才开始关注这些棚户区的问题。然而，正如人类学家艾伦·斯马特所论证的那样，政府对石硖尾灾难的应对并非彻底颠覆了其早期的安置政策。与“石硖尾神话”相反，殖民政府实际上早在 1952 年就开始大力安置棚户居民，这主要是因为政府担心棚户区火灾引发的骚乱会破坏香港脆弱的地缘政治地位，而且棚户区不仅存在严重的健康和安全隐患，还会威胁政府的土地收入。 10 历史学家大卫·福尔（David Faure）采取了略有不同的视角，但也强调了这些安置工作的战略目的 。 他认为，石硖尾为殖民地政府提供了一个理想的借口。殖民地政府迫于殖民地事务部的压力，本想更早推行公共房屋，但却遭到了中国精英阶层的反对。11 尽管如此，政府的公共房屋计划最终发展成为一项由新成立的安置署负责的大规模安置项目，并伴随着教育和医疗服务的扩展。英国、中国和美国政府都为这项房屋计划做出了贡献，这再次展现了香港新的地缘政治地位。 +



Although more than 30 percent of Hong Kong’s population lived in government housing by the 1960s, these new resettlement policies revealed how Hong Kong remained well behind the rest of the industrialized world in terms of social welfare.  +
The tiny, overcrowded apartments in the new public housing units were often little better than the squatter huts they were designed to replace.  +
Elsie Tu recalls how the rooms in these “rabbit warrens” averaged only 120 square feet for a family of five and 86 square feet for smaller families.  +
Small children “were counted as half persons” and were allocated only 12 square feet each.  +
“A flat consisted of a square or oblong room, with concrete walls, without decoration, and with neither kitchen nor bathroom.  +
Cooking was usually done on the narrow verandahs that surrounded each block, though that was supposed to be illegal.  +
Communal toilets and bathrooms were situated in the centre of each block of flats, along with a washroom for laundering.  +
With no full-size doors, it became a nightmare for women to use the bathrooms, and they usually had to be accompanied by another person, because of the prevalence of ‘peeping toms.’ The toilets themselves consisted only of a narrow channel that ran through the whole row of toilets.  +
At regular intervals water flowed through the channel to flush it.”12
尽管到 20 世纪 60 年代，香港超过 30%的人口居住在政府公屋中，但这些新的安置政策却暴露出香港在社会福利方面仍然远远落后于其他工业化国家。新建公屋里狭小拥挤的公寓，往往比它们原本要取代的棚户区也好不到哪里去。艾尔西·图回忆说，这些“兔子窝”里的房间，五口之家平均只有 120 平方英尺，小家庭也只有 86 平方英尺。幼儿“被算作半个人”，每人只分配到 12 平方英尺的空间。 “公寓通常由一个方形或长方形的房间组成，墙壁是水泥的，没有任何装饰，既没有厨房也没有浴室。做饭通常在环绕每栋楼的狭窄走廊上进行，尽管这在当时被认为是违法的。公共厕所和浴室位于每栋公寓楼的中心，旁边还有一个洗衣房。由于没有全尺寸的门，女性使用浴室成了噩梦，而且由于偷窥者猖獗，她们通常需要另一个人陪同。厕所本身只有一条贯穿整排厕所的狭窄通道。每隔一段时间，水就会流过通道进行冲洗。” 12 +
The government also continued to rely heavily for social welfare on religious and charitable organizations, such as the Catholic Maryknoll Sisters who, writes historian Cindy Chu, “spearheaded efforts for poor refugee communities”; opened schools, clinics, and youth centers in resettlement estates; and “traveled the hillsides of wooden shacks and cared for the needy.”13 One reason the colonial government did not do more for the refugees from China was that it thought they would return to China once conditions there settled.  +
As G.  +
B.  +
Endacott explained, however, “the unspoken assumption was that Asians, and in particular the Chinese, were not forced to come to Hong Kong, and if they did so that was their own affair and they must accept conditions as they found them.”14 Many colonial officials feared that providing too much social welfare would only attract more refugees from the mainland.  +
Twisted as this logic may seem, it echoed an old concern shared not just by colonial officials and Chinese elites but also by many ordinary Chinese, who often justified conditions in Hong Kong by contrasting them with those on the mainland.
政府在社会福利方面也继续严重依赖宗教和慈善组织，例如天主教玛利诺修女会。历史学家辛迪·朱（Cindy Chu）写道，该修女会“带头帮助贫困的难民群体”；在安置区开设学校、诊所和青年中心；并且“走遍山坡上的木屋，照顾穷人”。 13 殖民政府没有为来自中国的难民提供更多帮助的原因之一是，他们认为一旦中国局势稳定下来，他们就会返回中国。然而，正如 G.B.恩达科特（G.B.  +
Endacott）所解释的那样，“人们心照不宣的假设是，亚洲人，特别是中国人，并非被迫来到香港，如果他们来了，那是他们自己的事，他们必须接受他们所遇到的情况。” 14 许多殖民官员担心，提供过多的社会福利只会吸引更多来自大陆的难民。这种逻辑虽然看似扭曲，但它反映了一种由来已久的担忧，这种担忧不仅存在于殖民官员和中国精英阶层中，也存在于许多普通中国人中，他们经常将香港的状况与大陆的状况进行对比，以此来为香港的状况辩护。 +



On the political front, the Hong Kong government had to learn how to coexist with both the PRC and the Republic of China on Taiwan.  +
In October 1956, for example, clashes between pro-Beijing and pro-Taipei supporters over a Nationalist flag that had been removed from a resettlement block resulted in riots in Kowloon, leading Nationalist sympathizers to loot stores owned by Communist supporters.  +
When pro-Nationalist mobs attacked and killed Communist sympathizers, the Hong Kong police responded by firing on pro-Nationalist rioters.  +
By the end of two weeks, 59 people were dead, and 443 had been hospitalized.
在政治方面，香港政府必须学会如何与中华人民共和国和台湾的中华民国共存。例如，1956年10月，亲北京和亲台北的支持者因一面国民党旗帜被从一处安置楼移除而发生冲突，导致九龙发生骚乱，国民党同情者抢劫了共产党支持者的商店。当亲国民党暴徒袭击并杀害共产党同情者时，香港警方开枪镇压了亲国民党暴徒。两周后，59人死亡，443人住院治疗。 +



Hostilities between China and Taiwan often threatened to undermine Hong Kong’s stability.  +
The three governments frequently disagreed over fishing rights and territorial waters.  +
Throughout the early 1950s, the Nationalists conducted guerrilla raids on Communist-held coastal islands and searched and harassed foreign vessels, including British freighters.  +
The Hong Kong and British governments were concerned that Nationalist blockades, mine-laying, and raids near Hong Kong might convince the PRC that the British were involved in such activities, thus provoking the PRC into attacking Hong Kong.  +
In 1954, Communist Chinese fighter planes shot down a Cathay Pacific airliner, killing eight people.  +
In April 1955, the Kaslmtir Princess, an Indian airliner transporting PRC officials and foreign journalists exploded after taking off for Jakarta from Kai Tak Airport.  +
Blaming the explosion on Taiwan agents, the PRC government demanded that the Hong Kong government capture the agents responsible.  +
In 1956 and 1958, Taiwanese fighter jets landed in Hong Kong after dogfights with Chinese airplanes, causing diplomatic rows involving the governments of China, Taiwan, Britain, and Hong Kong.  +
Although none of these incidents had any long-term effects, they showed the precarious nature of Hong Kong’s new geopolitical status.
中国大陆与台湾之间的敌对行动常常威胁到香港的稳定。三方政府经常在渔业权和领海问题上存在分歧。20 世纪 50 年代初期，国民党对共产党控制的沿海岛屿发动游击战，并搜查和骚扰外国船只，包括英国货轮。香港和英国政府担心，国民党在香港附近的封锁、布雷和袭击可能会让中华人民共和国政府误以为英国参与了这些活动，从而激怒中华人民共和国政府攻击香港。1954 年，中国共产党的战斗机击落了一架国泰航空的客机，造成 8 人死亡。1955 年 4 月，载有中华人民共和国官员和外国记者的印度客机 “卡斯尔姆蒂尔公主号” 从启德机场起飞前往雅加达后发生爆炸。中华人民共和国政府将爆炸事件归咎于台湾特工，并要求香港政府抓捕肇事者。 1956 年和 1958 年，台湾战机与中国战机发生空战后降落在香港，引发了涉及中国、台湾、英国和香港政府的外交争端。尽管这些事件均未造成长期影响，但却暴露出香港新的地缘政治地位的脆弱性。 +

Culturally, the closing of the border between Hong Kong and China created a sense of isolation for many Chinese in Hong Kong, which the colonial government was quick to exploit through its education policies.  +
In 1952 the Hong Kong Education Department appointed a committee to investigate the place of Chinese history, language, and literature in the Hong Kong school curriculum.  +
In November 1953, the committee recommended an emphasis on Chinese culture, against the emphasis on nationalism and patriotism in China and Taiwan.  +
This was not an attempt to return to some sort of cultural traditionalism; rather, argues historian Bernard Luk, it was a scheme “for Chinese culture and British colonialism to survive together in the shadow of the Communist threat.” Thus, after 1949 “generations of Hong Kong Chinese pupils grew up, learning from the Chinese culture subjects to identify themselves as Chinese but relating that Chineseness to neither contemporary China nor the local Hong Kong landscape.  +
It was a Chinese identity in the abstract, a patriotism of the émigré, probably held all the more absolutely because it was not connected to tangible reality.”15 Although this curriculum helped nurture a sense of Chinese heritage and identity, it also shaped a sense of Hong Kong being at the periphery of both the Chinese and the Western worlds.
在文化上，香港与中国大陆边界的关闭给许多香港华人带来了孤立感，殖民政府迅速利用这一点，通过其教育政策加以利用。1952 年，香港教育署委任一个委员会，调查中国历史、语言和文学在香港学校课程中的地位。1953 年 11 月，该委员会建议强调中国文化，以区别于中国大陆和台湾地区强调民族主义和爱国主义的做法。这并非试图回归某种文化传统主义；历史学家陆伯纳认为，这是一种“让中国文化和英国殖民主义在共产主义威胁的阴影下共存”的策略。因此，1949 年以后，“一代又一代的香港华裔学生在学习中国文化课程的过程中，认同自己是中国人，但这种中国身份既没有与当代中国联系起来，也没有与香港本土的现实联系起来。这是一种抽象的中国身份认同，一种移民的爱国主义，或许正是因为它脱离了具体的现实，才显得更加绝对。” 15 虽然这门课程有助于培养中国传统和身份认同感，但也使人觉得香港处于中国和西方世界的边缘。 +



THE 1960s  20世纪60年代
Intrigued by Hong Kong’s peripheral quality, British author Ian Fleming described the colony as “the most vivid and exciting city I have ever seen.” Offering “modern comfort in a theatrically Oriental setting,” Hong Kong was a “gay and splendid colony humming with vitality and progress.” Knowing that “six hundred and fifty million Communist Chinese are a few miles away across the frontier seems only to add zest to the excitement at all levels of life in the colony, and from the Governor down, if there is an underlying tension, there is certainly no dismay.  +
Obviously China could take Hong Kong by a snap of its giant fingers, but China has shown no signs of wishing to do so.” Fleming concluded that “whatever the future holds, there is no sign that a sinister, doom-fraught count-down is in progress.”16
英国作家伊恩·弗莱明被香港的边缘特质所吸引，他将这片殖民地描述为“我所见过的最生动、最令人兴奋的城市”。香港“在充满戏剧性的东方环境中提供现代化的舒适生活”，是一个“充满活力和进步的欢乐而辉煌的殖民地”。他指出，“六亿五千万共产主义中国就在几英里之外的边境另一侧，但这似乎只会为殖民地各阶层的生活增添更多活力。从总督到普通民众，即使存在潜在的紧张气氛，也丝毫没有沮丧之感。显然，中国可以轻而易举地吞并香港，但中国并未表现出任何这样的意愿。”弗莱明总结道，“无论未来如何，都没有任何迹象表明一场不祥的、充满厄运的倒计时正在进行。” 16 +
Fleming had good reason to be optimistic about Hong Kong.  +
By the early 1960s, the colony had earned an international reputation for its light industry, particularly in electronics such as transistor radios.  +
In 1961 the colony became known across the globe as a meeting place of East and West when Richard Mason’s novel The World of Suzie Wong was adapted into a film starring William Holden and Hong Kong’s own Nancy Kwan.  +
Three years later, the Beatles performed two concerts at the Princess Theatre.  +
The completion in 1963 of the colony’s largest reservoir, Shek Pik, on Lantau Island seemed to reaffirm Britain’s commitment to holding on to its last Asian colony.  +
And although in the same year the People’s Daily declared ominously that the question of Hong Kong would be “settled peacefully through negotiations” when conditions were “ripe,” three years later the Chinese foreign minister insisted that recovering Taiwan was a priority but that Hong Kong and Macau were not.
弗莱明有充分的理由对香港抱持乐观态度。到了 20 世纪 60 年代初，香港凭借其轻工业，特别是晶体管收音机等电子产品，赢得了国际声誉。1961 年，理查德·梅森的小说 《苏丝黄的世界》 被改编成电影，由威廉·霍尔顿和香港本土演员关南施主演，香港也因此成为东西方文化交融之地，名扬全球。三年后，披头士乐队在公主剧院举办了两场演唱会。1963 年，香港最大的水库——位于大屿山的石壁水库竣工，似乎再次印证了英国对保住其在亚洲最后一块殖民地的决心。尽管同年， 《人民日报》 发表了意味深长的声明，称香港问题将在“时机成熟”时“通过谈判和平解决”，但三年后，中国外交部长却坚称，收复台湾才是当务之急，香港和澳门则并非首要任务。 +

The Star Ferry Riots of 1966
1966年天星小轮暴动
Beneath this rosy veneer lay serious social tensions.  +
Since 1960, Hong Kong’s population had increased from around four million to almost five million.  +
Most of this increase occurred during the catastrophic Great Leap Forward (1958–1961) in China and the subsequent three years of famine.  +
Some 150,000 refugees were estimated to have come in 1962 alone.  +
In May 1962, with help from Chinese border guards, between 60,000 and 100,000 Chinese crossed the border illegally (although some 60,000 of them were arrested and repatriated within a month).  +
Hong Kong police and troops subsequently built a barbwire fence behind the existing British fence.  +
By 1964, almost 500,000 squatters were living in hillside shacks or rooftop huts.  +
With crowded housing, extreme gaps in wealth, poor working conditions, lack of political representation, and the prevalence of government corruption, especially in the police force, it is not surprising that riots would occur in the spring of 1966.
在这层玫瑰色的表象之下，隐藏着严重的社会矛盾。自1960年以来，香港人口从约400万增至近500万。这一增长主要发生在1958年至1961年中国灾难性的“大跃进”时期以及随后的三年饥荒期间。据估计，仅1962年一年，就有约15万难民涌入香港。1962年5月，在中国边防部队的协助下，约有6万至10万中国人非法越境（尽管其中约6万人在一个月内被捕并遣返）。随后，香港警方和军队在原有的英国围栏后方修建了一道铁丝网。到1964年，近50万棚户居民居住在山坡上的棚屋或屋顶的简易房里。由于住房拥挤、贫富差距极大、工作条件恶劣、缺乏政治代表权以及政府腐败盛行（尤其是在警察部队中），1966 年春季发生骚乱也就不足为奇了。 +



On April 4, a young Chinese man named So Sau-chung protested an increase in fares on the Star Ferry by declaring a hunger strike in front of the Star Ferry piers, first in Central District, and then in Tsim Sha Tsui, the main tourist district.  +
When the police arrested him for obstruction the next day, other youths rioted and stoned the police.  +
One rioter was killed, and by April 8 more than fourteen hundred youths had been arrested.  +
The cause of the riots does not appear to have been economic.  +
Nor, despite the growth of anticolonial movements around the world, was it particularly anti-British.  +
Rather, the rioters were expressing their social discontent, just as their counterparts were doing in Britain, Europe, and other parts of the world.
4月4日，一名名叫苏秀忠的中国青年因不满天星小轮票价上涨，在天星小轮码头前绝食抗议。他先是在中环码头，后又转移到主要旅游区尖沙咀。第二天，警方以妨碍公务罪将其逮捕，随后其他青年参与暴动，向警察投掷石块。一名暴动者被杀，截至4月8日，已有超过1400名青年被捕。这场暴动的起因似乎并非经济问题。尽管世界各地反殖民运动蓬勃发展，但这场暴动也并非特别针对英国。相反，暴动者们表达的是他们对社会的不满，正如英国、欧洲以及世界其他地区的民众所做的那样。 +



After an official inquiry, Elsie Elliot, who was known as an advocate for the poor and for trying to expose police corruption—and whose name the hunger striker had invoked because Elliot had solicited public opinion on whether the fare increases were acceptable—was censured for provoking the demonstrators and making “unsubstantiated” allegations against the police.  +
Although the inquiry commission could offer no other explanation, it insisted that the riots had not been caused by economic, political, or social conditions.  +
Some of the youths admitted to having joined the riots mainly to protest the fare increases, but others claimed to have done so out of the excitement of the moment, for fun, or simply to let off steam.  +
One of the riot leaders later committed suicide; another ended up in a mental hospital.  +
Still, the inquiry commission conceded that overcrowding, the struggle to maintain a living, and “the underlying insecurity of life in the Colony, resulting from international political and economic conditions, create tensions which elsewhere would be more than sufficient cause for frequent disturbances.”17
经过官方调查，以维护穷人权益和揭露警察腐败而闻名的艾尔西·艾略特（Elsie Elliot）——绝食者曾提及她的名字，因为她曾就票价上涨是否可以接受征求公众意见——因煽动示威者和对警方提出“未经证实”的指控而受到谴责。尽管调查委员会无法给出其他解释，但它坚称骚乱并非由经济、政治或社会状况引起。一些年轻人承认参与骚乱主要是为了抗议票价上涨，但其他人则声称是出于一时的兴奋、寻求刺激或仅仅是为了发泄情绪。一名骚乱领袖后来自杀身亡；另一名则被送进了精神病院。尽管如此，调查委员会也承认，过度拥挤、维持生计的困境以及“殖民地因国际政治和经济形势而导致的根本性不安全感，造成了紧张局势，这些紧张局势在其他地方足以引发频繁的骚乱。” 17 +
The Confrontation of 1967
1967年的对抗
Whereas the 1966 riots lasted less than a week, a dispute in May 1967 over wages and working hours quickly escalated into more than six months of violence orchestrated by the local branch of the Chinese Communist Party, the Hong Kong and Macau Work Committee.  +
Inspired by the Cultural Revolution in China, where youths known as the Red Guards were heeding Chairman Mao Zedong’s call to continue the revolutionary struggle, left-wing activists fought with the colonial police.  +
Although a similar situation had occurred in 1966 in Macau, where Portuguese troops fired on rioting pro-Beijing activists, conditions in Hong Kong became much worse.  +
Rioters burned cars and attacked the police, while local left-wing schools encouraged their students to participate with bombs made in the schools’ science laboratories and then planted throughout the colony.  +
By the end of the six months, the official death toll was fifty-one, of which ten were police officers.  +
At least eight hundred people were injured in the riots and more than three hundred others were wounded by bombs.  +
More than five thousand people were arrested and jailed, often without trial, while many others were secretly deported.  +
Sino-British relations reached their lowest point in the history of the new PRC.
1966年的骚乱持续不到一周，而1967年5月，一场关于工资和工时的纠纷迅速升级为长达六个多月的暴力冲突，这场冲突由中国共产党香港澳门工作委员会（港澳联委）策划。受中国文化大革命的启发——当时被称为“红卫兵”的青年响应毛泽东主席的号召，继续进行革命斗争——左翼活动人士与殖民警察发生冲突。尽管1966年澳门也发生过类似事件，葡萄牙军队向亲北京的骚乱者开枪，但香港的情况要糟糕得多。暴徒焚烧汽车，袭击警察，而当地的左翼学校则鼓励学生在学校的科学实验室制造炸弹，然后将其安放在殖民地各地。六个月后，官方公布的死亡人数为51人，其中包括10名警察。至少有800人在骚乱中受伤，另有300多人被炸弹炸伤。超过五千人被捕入狱，其中许多人未经审判就被监禁，另有许多人被秘密驱逐出境。中英关系跌至中华人民共和国历史上的最低点。 +



Hong Kong had never experienced anything like the Confrontation (as colonial officials called it) of 1967, but the disturbances, like the Star Ferry riots the previous year, revealed many of the conditions in Hong Kong that provided a favorable environment for civil unrest.  +
Lower labor costs in Taiwan and South Korea had encouraged fears of unemployment and dislocation, half of the population was under age twenty-one, and only 13 percent of youths fifteen to nineteen years old were in school.  +
Some 12 percent of these students were enrolled in pro-Beijing schools, where they were inspired by the Cultural Revolution and by the anti-imperialist movements around the world.
香港从未经历过类似1967年那场被殖民官员称为“对抗”的事件，但这场骚乱，如同前一年的天星小轮暴动一样，暴露了香港诸多滋生社会动荡的根源。台湾和韩国较低的劳动力成本加剧了人们对失业和流离失所的担忧；香港一半人口年龄在21岁以下；15至19岁的青少年入学率仅为13%。其中约12%的学生就读于亲北京学校，他们深受文化大革命和世界各地反帝运动的影响。 +



On May Day, traditionally a day for workers’ celebrations and demonstrations, three labor strikes began.  +
The disputes had not been resolved by the end of the week, and on May 6 one of the strikes, at the Hong Kong Artificial Flower Works in San Po Kong, Kowloon, turned violent as nonstriking workers and, subsequently, the police were brought in.  +
As John Cooper, a Briton who was living in Hong Kong at the time and wrote one of the most thorough accounts of the disturbances, stated, San Po Kong had “all the natural advantages” for civil unrest.  +
“Street upon street of tall dilapidated buildings vied with each other for the limited space available, hundreds upon hundreds of hostile citizens lived out their lives in human rabbit warrens, plenty of workers were available to start a riot, plenty of workers’ organisations existed to support it and plenty of students would come along to give it political backing.”18
五一劳动节是传统的工人庆祝和示威游行的日子，当天却爆发了三场罢工。到周末，劳资纠纷仍未解决。5 月 6 日，位于九龙新蒲岗香港人造花厂的罢工演变为暴力冲突，非罢工工人随后介入，警方也介入其中。当时居住在香港的英国人约翰·库珀（John Cooper）对这场骚乱做了详尽的记录，他写道，新蒲岗具备了发生社会动荡的“所有天然条件”。“街道两旁林立着破败的高楼大厦，争夺着有限的空间；成百上千的敌对市民生活在如同兔子窝般的拥挤环境中；大量工人随时准备发动暴乱；众多工人组织为其提供支持；还有许多学生会加入其中，为其提供政治声援。” 18 +
In such a conducive environment, by the morning of May 11 the strike in San Po Kong had turned political, with posters condemning the “British authorities of Hong Kong” and workers waving Mao’s “Little Red Book,” chanting revolutionary slogans, and singing revolutionary songs.  +
By afternoon, demonstrators were banging on the factory gates, and the police were called in.  +
That evening, the demonstrators, now joined by crowds of youths, started pelting the police with stones and bottles.  +
The police, who had been trained to handle riots since the 1956 anti-Communist riots and who had sharpened their antiriot training after the 1966 Star Ferry riots and the hostilities in Macau, responded with clubs and tear gas.  +
As the unrest spread to the nearby Tung Tau Resettlement Estate, the entire area was placed under a curfew.  +
The next morning, drivers and conductors for the Kowloon Motor Bus Company were chanting Mao’s sayings at the bus terminal at the Star Ferry in Tsim Sha Tsui and affixing anti-imperialist stickers to their buses.  +
Two youths in Red Guard uniforms, both claiming to be from Canton, were shouting Communist slogans outside a school in Mongkok.  +
The next day, posters were calling “Down with David Trench,” while crowds were building roadblocks and barricades and were setting cars and buses on fire.
在这种有利的环境下，5月11日清晨，新蒲岗的罢工已演变为政治事件，工人们张贴海报谴责“香港英国当局”，挥舞着毛主席语录《毛主席语录》，高喊革命口号，唱着革命歌曲。到了下午，示威者开始猛烈敲打工厂大门，警方随即赶到现场。当晚，示威者中加入了大批青年，他们开始向警察投掷石块和瓶子。警方自1956年反共暴动以来就接受过应对暴乱的训练，并在1966年天星小轮暴动和澳门冲突后进一步加强了防暴训练，他们以警棍和催泪瓦斯还击。随着骚乱蔓延至附近的东头安置邨，整个地区随即实施宵禁。第二天早上，九龙巴士公司的司机和售票员在尖沙咀天星码头的巴士总站高喊毛泽东语录，并在巴士上张贴反帝贴纸。两名身穿红卫兵制服、自称来自广州的青年在旺角一所学校外高喊共产主义口号。第二天，到处张贴着“打倒大卫·特伦奇”的标语，人群设置路障和路障，并纵火焚烧汽车和巴士。 +



By the middle of May, the unrest had spread throughout Kowloon and to Hong Kong Island.  +
Angry demonstrators plastered posters on the gates and walls to Government House demanding to see the governor and also demanding that their arrested comrades be released.  +
The demonstrators marched through Central District, defacing buildings, attacking a BBC television team from Britain, and demanding that the Hilton Hotel take down its British and American flags.  +
With all sorts of rumors flying about—water and electricity were going to be stopped, for example, and there would be a general strike—prices soared.  +
To boost morale, the government had to issue a statement and radio broadcast that the rumors were unfounded.  +
Still, from late May into early June, strikes broke out in transport services, food production, and retail sectors; textile mills; and some government departments.
到五月中旬，动乱已蔓延至九龙和香港岛。愤怒的示威者在政府大楼的大门和墙壁上张贴海报，要求会见总督，并要求释放被捕的同伴。示威者游行穿过中环，损毁建筑物，袭击英国广播公司（BBC）的摄制组，并要求希尔顿酒店撤下英国和美国国旗。各种谣言四起——例如，停水停电，以及即将举行总罢工——导致物价飞涨。为了提振士气，政府不得不发表声明并通过广播澄清谣言不实。尽管如此，从五月下旬到六月初，交通运输、食品生产、零售业、纺织厂以及一些政府部门仍然爆发了罢工。 +

Although many accounts of the 1967 disturbances portray them as being instigated almost solely by local Communists and Red Guards from Guangdong, the Anti-British Struggle Committee enjoyed strong support in China, both—at least in the early stages—from the central government and from the population at large.  +
Like the leftist radicals in Hong Kong, the PRC government insisted that the struggle in Hong Kong was part of the worldwide fight against colonialism and imperialism.  +
In mid-May, the PRC vice minister for foreign affairs, Luo Cuibo, presented Donald Hopson, British charge d’affaires in Beijing, with a formal protest and list of demands: accept all of the workers’ demands, free all arrested people, end all “fascist measures,” apologize to victims and compensate them, and guarantee that there would be no more similar incidents.  +
Luo condemned the British “atrocities” and “sanguinary oppression” as part of the British government’s “collusion with American imperialism against China” and accused the British of letting the United States use Hong Kong as “a base for aggression against Vietnam.” Crowds marched outside Hopson’s office, shouting slogans, waving flags and placards, and burning effigies of Prime Minister Harold Wilson.
尽管许多关于1967年骚乱的记载将其描述为几乎完全由广东的当地共产党人和红卫兵煽动，但抗英斗争委员会在中国却拥有强大的支持，至少在初期阶段，这种支持来自中央政府和广大民众。与香港的左翼激进分子一样，中国政府坚称香港的斗争是全球反殖民主义和反帝国主义斗争的一部分。5月中旬，中华人民共和国外交部副部长罗翠波向英国驻北京临时代办唐纳德·霍普森递交了一份正式抗议书和一系列要求：接受工人的所有诉求，释放所有被捕人员，停止一切“法西斯措施”，向受害者道歉并给予赔偿，并保证不再发生类似事件。罗冠聪谴责英国的“暴行”和“血腥镇压”，称这是英国政府“勾结美国帝国主义对华作恶”的一部分，并指责英国放任美国利用香港作为“侵略越南的基地”。人群聚集在霍普森办公室外，高喊口号，挥舞旗帜和标语牌，焚烧首相哈罗德·威尔逊的肖像。 +



On May 17, one million protesters marched past the British office in Beijing armed with posters demanding that the British leave Hong Kong and vowing to “Hang Wilson.” The PRC state radio declared that the British atrocities in Hong Kong were a carefully orchestrated part of Britain’s collusion with the United States against China.  +
(The United States saw the matter as being between China and Britain and did not interfere, particularly since no American citizens were involved.) A mass rally on May 18 at the sports stadium in Beijing attracted one hundred thousand people.  +
Dignitaries in attendance included Premier Zhou Enlai, Foreign Minister Chen Yi, and Public Security Minister Xie Fuzhi, who accused the Hong Kong government of conspiring with Chiang Kai-shek to destabilize the PRC.  +
In Shanghai, protesters broke into and destroyed the home of Peter Hewitt, the British diplomatic representative.  +
They defaced a picture of Queen Elizabeth and tried to make Hewitt bow before a picture of Mao.  +
When Hewitt refused, the protesters forced him to march around his house, and they harassed his wife and children.
5月17日，一百万名示威者手持标语，游行经过英国驻北京办事处，要求英国撤出香港，并扬言要“绞死威尔逊”。中华人民共和国国家广播电台宣称，英国在香港的暴行是英国与美国勾结反华的精心策划的一部分。（美国认为此事是中英之间的事，并未干预，尤其因为没有美国公民卷入其中。）5月18日，在北京体育场举行的大规模集会吸引了十万人参加。出席集会的政要包括国务院总理周恩来、外交部长陈毅和公安部长谢福之，谢福之指责香港特区政府与蒋介石勾结，企图破坏中华人民共和国的稳定。在上海，示威者闯入并破坏了英国驻港外交代表彼得·休伊特的住所。他们损毁了伊丽莎白女王的画像，并试图强迫休伊特向毛泽东的画像下跪。休伊特拒绝后，抗议者强迫他绕着房子游行，并骚扰他的妻子和孩子。 +



Although the British government had initially declined to comment on Beijing’s list of demands, on May 18 it issued a statement supporting the Hong Kong government for fulfilling its “inescapable duty to maintain law and order as impartially and fairly as possible for the benefit of all in Hong Kong” and insisting that labor and management should be able to resolve the cause of this disturbance—a “comparatively small industrial conflict”—“in reason and goodwill.” The British also sent three officials from the Commonwealth Office and the Foreign Office on a one-week mission to investigate the situation.  +
On June 2, Judith Hart, minister of state for Commonwealth affairs, defended the Hong Kong government in the House of Commons but promised that she would inquire into Hong Kong’s labor laws and mechanisms for resolving labor disputes.  +
Even after a People’s Daily editorial on June 3 beckoned Hong Kong Chinese to “launch a vigorous struggle against the wicked British imperialists,” the British government confirmed that it would still try to help China get a seat in the UN.  +
On June 22, the House of Lords debated the Hong Kong situation, calling for Britain to maintain the security of Hong Kong but to try to improve labor conditions.
尽管英国政府最初拒绝就北京提出的要求清单置评，但在 5 月 18 日发表声明，支持香港特区政府履行其“维护香港法律和秩序，为香港全体人民谋福祉，且不可推卸的职责”，并坚持认为劳资双方应该能够“本着理性与善意”解决此次骚乱的根源——一场“相对较小的劳资冲突”。英国还派遣了三名来自联邦事务部和外交部的官员前往香港进行为期一周的考察。6 月 2 日，负责联邦事务的国务大臣朱迪思·哈特在下议院为香港特区政府辩护，并承诺将调查香港的劳动法和劳资纠纷解决机制。即便在 6 月 3 日 《人民日报》 发表社论，号召香港市民“对邪恶的英国帝国主义者发起一场激烈的斗争”之后，英国政府仍然确认将尽力帮助中国获得联合国席位。 6 月 22 日，上议院就香港局势展开辩论，呼吁英国维护香港安全，但同时努力改善香港的劳动条件。 +



The leftists also had an arsenal of propaganda equipment in Hong Kong: approximately ten left-wing newspapers; the New China News Agency, which directed the propaganda campaign and sent exaggerated reports of local support to newspapers in China; loudspeakers placed outside buildings such as the Bank of China; posters demanding “Blood for Blood,” “Stew the White-Skinned Pig,” “Fry the Yellow Running Dogs,” “Down with British Imperialism,” and “Hang David Trench”; and effigies of the governor and other local British and Chinese leaders, often decorated with real or simulated bombs to discourage the police from removing them.  +
Left-wing newspapers saw the Hong Kong police as trying to protect management from the legitimate complaints and grievances of workers.  +
The New China News Agency denounced Governor Trench for not meeting petitioners and for making Government House “a place to condemn the British paper tiger and a big classroom for the creative study and application of the invincible thoughts of Mao Zedong.” On May 29, the agency accused the British of using the aircraft carrier HMS Bulwark, supposedly in Hong Kong on a routing training exercise, to intimidate the Chinese of Hong Kong.  +
(Trench had in fact requested the British Admiralty to dispatch the vessel as a show of force.)
左翼人士在香港也拥有一套强大的宣传工具：大约十份左翼报纸；新华社，负责指挥宣传活动，并向中国大陆的报纸发送夸大的本地支持率报道；在中国银行等建筑物外设置的扩音器；张贴着“以血还血”、“炖白皮猪”、“炸黄狗”、“打倒英国帝国主义”、“绞死大卫·特伦奇”等标语的海报；以及港督和其他本地英国和中国领导人的画像，这些画像通常装饰着真炸弹或假炸弹，以阻止警方移除。左翼报纸认为香港警方试图保护管理层免受工人的合理投诉和不满。新华社谴责特伦奇总督拒绝接见请愿者，并将港督府变成“谴责英国纸老虎的地方，以及创造性地学习和应用毛泽东不屈思想的大教室”。 5 月 29 日，该机构指责英国利用当时据称正在香港进行例行训练演习的航空母舰“ 布尔沃克 ”号恐吓香港市民。（事实上，特伦奇曾要求英国海军部派遣该舰以示武力。） +
The colonial government responded with its own extensive counterpropaganda campaign, whose organizer, Jimmy McGregor, received frequent death threats and was condemned by the leftists as a “vagabond and a criminal,” the “governor’s jackal,” and a “wolf whining in the night.” Under the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, the police were allowed to detain suspected activists without trial.  +
In mid-May, the colonial government banned loudspeaker broadcasts such as those coming from the Bank of China.  +
Governor Trench appeared on television and encouraged the public to stand tall during the disturbances.  +
On June 1, the government prohibited inflammatory posters and specified punishments for anyone who produced, distributed, or displayed such posters.  +
The PRC government and the local branch of the New China News Agency condemned the ban as a “political provocation” and “fascist decree.”
殖民政府随即展开大规模反宣传运动，其组织者吉米·麦格雷戈(Jimmy McGregor)屡遭死亡威胁，并被左翼人士斥为“流浪汉和罪犯”、“总督的走狗”和“夜半哀嚎的狼”。根据《紧急状态条例》，警方获准未经审判拘留涉嫌活动人士。5 月中旬，殖民政府禁止了包括中国银行在内的各种扩音器广播。总督特伦奇(Trench)出现在电视上，鼓励民众在骚乱中保持镇定。6 月 1 日，政府禁止张贴煽动性海报，并明确规定了对制作、散发或展示此类海报者的处罚。中华人民共和国政府和新华社地方分社谴责该禁令是“政治挑衅”和“法西斯法令”。 +



Having served in other colonies, some British police commanders knew the danger of responding to such movements with force, especially with China so close.  +
The situation was particularly delicate in the New Territories, where the border between Hong Kong and China was often relatively porous.  +
On the morning of July 8, villagers from the Chinese part of Sha Tau Kok, a border village divided into Chinese and British sectors, attacked a police post with stones, bottles, bombs, and, later, automatic weapons.  +
A violent clash had already occurred in the same village on June 24, but five policemen were killed in this second attack.  +
With more than eighty of their policemen holed up in the police post but anxious not to provoke China, Hong Kong authorities had to await approval from London before sending in the military.  +
This clash at Sha Tau Kok, along with reports of several thousand people in uniform moving toward the Man Kam To bridge, a major border-crossing point, sent the colony into panic.  +
From July 9 to July 11, violent clashes occurred between rioters and policemen throughout Hong Kong Island, with one policeman left dead.  +
On July 12, the government imposed curfews in Hong Kong and Kowloon.
曾在其他殖民地任职的英国警官深知，以武力应对此类行动的危险性，尤其是在中国近在咫尺的情况下。新界的情况尤为微妙，因为香港与中国的边界往往相对松散。7月8日清晨，沙头角（一个分为中英两区的边境村庄）中方村民用石块、瓶子、炸弹，以及后来的自动武器袭击了一个警察哨所。6月24日，该村已发生过一次激烈的冲突，但在第二次袭击中，五名警察丧生。由于八十多名警察被困在哨所内，但香港当局担心激怒中国，不得不等待伦敦的批准才能派遣军队。沙头角的冲突，以及数千名身着制服的人正向主要过境点文锦渡桥进发的报道，使整个殖民地陷入恐慌。 7月9日至11日，香港岛各地发生暴徒与警察之间的暴力冲突，一名警察殉职。7月12日，政府在香港和九龙实施宵禁。 +



The deaths of six policemen in one weekend shocked the colony.  +
They also made the police take a much more active, less restrained approach to dealing with the leftists, raiding (often working closely with local military regiments and battalions) suspected centers of Communist activities and seizing weapons, bombs, and Communist literature.  +
As the police changed their tactics in mid-July, so did the leftists, who started bombing police stations and other government buildings.  +
By late July, the targets of the bombings expanded to theaters, parks, markets, and other public places.  +
Buses and taxis were set on fire, and bombs—real or fake—were planted nearly everywhere.  +
On July 20, the government put into effect nine emergency regulations enacted in 1949, most giving the police wider powers of search and arrest.  +
The editors, publishers, and printers of three leftist newspapers were charged and convicted of false reporting.
一个周末内六名警察的殉职震惊了整个殖民地。这也促使警方采取更加积极主动、毫不留情的手段来应对左翼分子，他们突袭（通常与当地军队密切合作）疑似共产主义活动中心，缴获武器、炸弹和共产主义宣传品。7月中旬，随着警方策略的转变，左翼分子也随之改变策略，开始轰炸警察局和其他政府大楼。到7月下旬，轰炸目标扩大到剧院、公园、市场和其他公共场所。公共汽车和出租车被纵火焚烧，炸弹——无论是真炸弹还是假炸弹——几乎随处可见。7月20日，政府实施了1949年颁布的九项紧急法令，其中大部分赋予警方更大的搜查和逮捕权力。三家左翼报纸的编辑、出版商和印刷商被指控并被判犯有虚假报道罪。 +



When in August the leftists shifted from riots to attacking people who opposed them and planting bombs, the police stepped up their crackdowns.  +
The most sensational raid was on August 4, when more than one thousand policemen and soldiers, supported by three helicopters from HMS Hermes, launched an attack from the ground and the air on three leftist strongholds, one of which was booby-trapped and contained bomb-making equipment.  +
The leftists then turned to planting bombs where children could easily find them.  +
In one incident, a bomber’s children—whom the bomber had taken with him while planting bombs—were killed when the bombs exploded prematurely.  +
On August 20, two children in North Point on Hong Kong Island were killed by a bomb planted in a ball.  +
On August 24, the leftists attacked the car of Lam Bun, a popular radio commentator who had criticized their activities.  +
After setting Lam’s car on fire, they poured gasoline on Lam and his cousin and set them on fire.  +
The leftists had already been sending threatening letters to Chinese business and community leaders; now they issued lists of other so-called traitors to be executed.
8 月，左翼分子从暴乱转向袭击反对者并安放炸弹，警方随即加大了镇压力度。其中最引人注目的一次突袭发生在 8 月 4 日，当时一千多名警察和士兵在“ 赫尔墨斯” 号两栖攻击舰三架直升机的支援下，对三个左翼分子据点发动了地面和空中联合攻击，其中一个据点被设置了陷阱，并藏有炸弹制造设备。之后，左翼分子开始在儿童容易发现的地方安放炸弹。在一次事件中，一名炸弹制造者带着自己的孩子一起安放炸弹，结果炸弹提前爆炸，导致两名儿童丧生。8 月 20 日，香港岛北角两名儿童被一个藏在球里的炸弹炸死。8 月 24 日，左翼分子袭击了批评左翼分子活动的知名电台评论员林斌的汽车。他们先是放火烧毁了林斌的汽车，然后向林斌和他的表弟身上泼汽油并点燃。左翼分子此前已向中国商界和社区领袖寄送恐吓信；现在他们又公布了其他所谓“叛徒”的名单，准备处决他们。 +



The PRC government was concerned about the heavy-handed police response to the rioters and was particularly disturbed by signs of military activity in Hong Kong, such as visiting British warships.  +
It was most bothered, however, by the “barbaric” and “fascist” arrest and confinement of left-wing reporters.  +
When the Hong Kong police arrested Xue Ping of the New China News Agency, on July 21 the Chinese government placed Reuter’s correspondent Anthony Grey under house arrest in Beijing.  +
(He was not released until October 1969, well after the disturbances had ended.) When Hong Kong police raided pro-Beijing shops, closed down newspapers, and arrested supporters, on August 22 Red Guards set fire to the British mission in Beijing and physically assaulted Hopson and two women in the mission until Chinese soldiers intervened and escorted the diplomats to safety.  +
After the PRC government prevented British diplomatic and commercial personnel from leaving China, the British and Chinese governments suspended some of each other’s diplomatic privileges.  +
When Chinese diplomats got into a scuffle with British civilians in London on August 29, the police had to intervene.  +
This prompted more angry responses from China.  +
Protesting that the British had instructed their police to beat the Chinese diplomats, the PRC government canceled all exit permits for Britons in China.  +
Red Guards demonstrated again outside the British mission in Beijing.
中国政府对警方镇压暴徒的强硬手段感到担忧，尤其对香港出现的军事活动迹象，例如英国军舰的到访感到不安。然而，最令其恼火的是左翼记者遭到“野蛮”和“法西斯”式的逮捕和监禁。7月21日，香港警方逮捕了新华社记者薛平，随后中国政府将路透社记者安东尼·格雷软禁在北京。（直到1969年10月，骚乱结束后很久，他才被释放。）8月22日，香港警方突袭亲北京商店、查封报刊、逮捕支持者，红卫兵纵火焚烧了英国驻北京使馆，并对霍普森和使馆内的两名女性进行人身攻击，直到中国士兵介入并将外交官们护送至安全地带。在中国政府阻止英国外交和商务人员离境后，英中两国政府暂停了对方的部分外交特权。 8月29日，中国外交官在伦敦与英国民众发生冲突，警方介入制止。这引发了中国的强烈不满。中国政府抗议英国指示其警察殴打中国外交官，并取消了所有在华英国公民的出境许可。随后，红卫兵再次在北京英国使馆外举行示威活动。 +



By September, the local leftists had begun to lose the support of Beijing and seemed to be fighting a lost cause.  +
The police had closed down many of the leftists’ headquarters, and the colonial government agreed to show leniency to strikers who promised not to strike again.  +
The leftists appeared to be divided, with one side preferring less violence and the other wanting to continue the attacks.  +
Relations between China and Britain had improved.  +
Toward the end of September, the British ambassador to the UN reported that despite China’s recent behavior, Britain still believed that it should be admitted to the UN.  +
On October 1, China’s national day, the PRC followed its annual tradition of honoring its agreement to provide water to Hong Kong twenty-four hours a day (the water supply had been reduced during the disturbances).
到了九月，香港左翼人士开始失去北京的支持，似乎陷入了一场注定失败的斗争。警方关闭了许多左翼人士的总部，殖民政府同意对承诺不再罢工的罢工者予以宽大处理。左翼人士内部似乎出现了分歧，一方倾向于减少暴力，另一方则希望继续抗议。中英关系有所改善。九月底，英国驻联合国大使报告称，尽管中国近期的行为令人担忧，但英国仍然认为中国应该被接纳为联合国成员国。10月1日是中国的国庆节，中华人民共和国按照惯例履行了向香港24小时供水的承诺（此前在骚乱期间，香港的供水曾一度减少）。 +



PRC leaders ultimately helped keep the movement from becoming too powerful by rerouting supplies after Red Guards disrupted supplies to Hong Kong and resisting calls from the Red Guards to overthrow Hong Kong’s capitalist and colonial systems.  +
Having monitored events closely from the outset, the PRC government became increasingly critical of the leftists’ tactics.  +
It did not approve of how certain prominent leftists in Hong Kong were known to live extravagantly.  +
(One leading Communist had arrived at the Government House protests in his chauffeur-driven Mercedes-Benz.) The PRC government also became upset when it realized that the Hong Kong leftists were sending inflated or even fabricated accounts of police atrocities and were exaggerating local support for the leftists.  +
One leader of the Anti-British Struggle Committee embarrassed the leftists and the PRC by defecting to Taiwan.  +
Jiang Qing, Chairman Mao’s wife, complained that a cash gift to the committee should have been used instead to promote Red Guard activities in the colony’s schools.  +
A lavish dinner party held by the committee in honor of October 1 also drew widespread criticism from the PRC government and the mainland press.
中华人民共和国领导人最终通过重新分配物资，阻止了红卫兵运动发展壮大。此前，红卫兵曾扰乱香港的物资供应。此外，他们还抵制了红卫兵推翻香港资本主义和殖民制度的号召。中国政府从一开始就密切关注事态发展，并逐渐对左翼的策略提出批评。政府对香港一些知名左翼人士奢靡的生活方式感到不满。（一位共产党领导人曾乘坐专职司机驾驶的奔驰车抵达政府大楼参加抗议活动。）中国政府还发现，香港左翼人士夸大甚至捏造警察暴行，并夸大当地民众对左翼的支持，这令政府感到愤怒。抗英斗争委员会的一位领导人叛逃台湾，令左翼人士和中国政府都感到难堪。毛泽东主席的妻子江青抱怨说，原本应该把给委员会的现金用于在香港学校推广红卫兵的活动。委员会为庆祝10月1日而举办的盛大晚宴也招致了中国政府和大陆媒体的广泛批评。 +



Conflicts still occurred, however, both in the urban areas of Hong Kong and Kowloon and along the Chinese border.  +
In late September, two Hong Kong Chinese police constables were abducted, to be released only in late November in return for five mainlanders arrested by the Hong Kong police.  +
In mid-October a British police officer was abducted, although he managed to escape back into Hong Kong a month later (leading some observers to suspect that he had been released in a prisoner exchange).  +
The arrival on October 13 of Lord Shepherd, British minister of state for Commonwealth affairs, prompted a new wave of violence.  +
Still, bomb reports were down by December, and the unrest had generally fizzled out by January 1968.
然而，冲突依然时有发生，无论是在香港和九龙的城区，还是在中国内地边境。9月下旬，两名香港警员被绑架，直到11月下旬才获释，作为交换，香港警方逮捕了五名内地人。10月中旬，一名英国警员被绑架，但一个月后他成功逃脱并返回香港（一些观察人士怀疑他是在一次换囚行动中获释的）。10月13日，英国联邦事务国务大臣谢泼德勋爵的到来引发了新一轮暴力冲突。不过，到12月，爆炸案报告有所减少，到1968年1月，动乱基本平息。 +



It is not hard to see why the leftists never found widespread local support for their cause, especially among a population that included so many people who had fled the Communist government in China and who viewed the Cultural Revolution with horror and revulsion.  +
Although some young people participated because of the way they had been treated by the police in the 1966 riots, the leftists failed to obtain widespread support from students.  +
The Federation of Students called for an end to the violence, and the University of Hong Kong Students’ Union sent the government a message of support.  +
Many community organizations, professional associations, and schools expressed their support, while scores of local people joined the Hong Kong Auxiliary Police Force.  +
Whereas the left-wing Chinese press supported the disturbances as the natural, heroic, patriotic reactions of an oppressed people, other Chinese newspapers called for people to stay out of the disturbances.  +
Letters to the editor in both Chinese and English newspapers often called for the government to take stronger measures but also appealed for an end to the disturbances and suggested ways of conciliation.  +
The disruption pushed many people to support the colonial government, while the leftists’ violent tactics made the police look like heroes—even when they attacked rioters with tear gas and clubs and arrested and imprisoned teenagers.  +
(The fact that an American television station caught on film a group of young protesters “bloodying” their heads with Mercurochrome just before the police in antiriot gear approached them did not endear the leftists to the population at large.) For its loyal service, in 1969 Queen Elizabeth renamed the police force the Royal Hong Kong Police Force.
不难理解为何左翼人士始终未能获得广泛的本地支持，尤其是在香港这样人口众多、其中不乏逃离中共政权、对文化大革命充满恐惧和厌恶之人的地区。尽管一些年轻人因在1966年骚乱中遭受警察不公对待而参与其中，但左翼人士未能获得学生群体的广泛支持。香港学生联合会呼吁停止暴力，香港大学学生会也向政府表达了支持。许多社区组织、专业协会和学校也表达了支持，同时还有大量本地居民加入了香港辅警部队。尽管左翼中文媒体支持这些骚乱，认为这是受压迫人民的自然、英勇和爱国反应，但其他一些中文报纸则呼吁民众远离骚乱。无论是中文报纸还是英文报纸，读者来信中都常常呼吁政府采取更强硬的措施，但也呼吁停止骚乱，并提出了和解方案。这场骚乱促使许多人支持殖民政府，而左翼分子的暴力手段反而让警察看起来像英雄——即便他们用催泪瓦斯和警棍袭击暴徒，逮捕并监禁青少年。（美国电视台拍到一群年轻示威者在防暴警察靠近前用红汞颜料涂抹头部，这一幕并没有让左翼分子赢得广大民众的好感。）为了表彰其忠诚服务，伊丽莎白女王于1969年将警队更名为皇家香港警队。 +



The 1967 disturbances had several important effects on Hong Kong.  +
Although the local Communist movement did not recover until the 1980s, the government’s treatment of the rioters strengthened the pro-Beijing convictions of people such as Tsang Yok Sing, whose teenage brother and sister had been arrested and imprisoned—he for printing and distributing leaflets, she simply for misbehaving at school.  +
Tsang recalls many of the rioters as being “simple workers who had been oppressed all their lives” and the government as responding to the riots in a “very high-handed, colonial manner.” Tsang was shunned at his university after the riots, but he found “lots of warm friendship, comradeship, and sympathy in the leftist circle.”19 He later became principal at one of Hong Kong’s leftist Chinese schools and in 1992 founded the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong.  +
His brother, Tsang Tak Sing, worked for one of the pro-Beijing daily newspapers in Hong Kong.
1967 年的骚乱对香港产生了诸多重要影响。尽管香港的共产党运动直到 20 世纪 80 年代才得以恢复，但政府对暴乱者的处置却强化了曾耀星等人的亲北京信念。曾耀星的弟弟和妹妹当时都是十几岁的少年，他们被捕入狱——弟弟是因为印发传单，妹妹则仅仅是因为在学校行为不端。曾耀星回忆说，许多暴乱者都是“一生饱受压迫的普通工人”，而政府对骚乱的回应则是“极其专横跋扈、殖民主义式的”。骚乱后，曾耀星在大学里遭到排斥，但他却在左翼圈子里找到了“许多温暖的友谊、同志情谊和同情”。 19 他后来成为香港一所左翼中文学校的校长，并在 1992 年创立了亲北京的香港民主复兴联。他的哥哥曾德星曾在香港一家亲北京的日报社工作。 +



For the majority of Hong Kong people, however, the disturbances gave the government new popularity and legitimacy.  +
The 1967 riots seemed to be proof that life in Hong Kong was better than on the mainland and that the people in Hong Kong had little to gain from any sort of anti-British campaign.  +
David Faure, who was then a student at the University of Hong Kong, writes that “the riots of 1967 were the first taste of open action directed against an established government, but for many, the demonstration, the bombs, and the occasional riot, confirmed what they were learning in the press of the excesses of the Cultural Revolution.”20 Forced to choose between the PRC and Hong Kong, most people in Hong Kong identified with the colonial regime as their government.  +
At the same time, they increasingly saw themselves as members of a special community, separate both from the colonial government and from their compatriots on the mainland.
然而，对大多数香港人来说，这些骚乱反而提升了政府的民意支持率和合法性。1967 年的暴动似乎证明，香港的生活比大陆更好，香港人从任何反英运动中都得不到什么好处。当时就读于香港大学的戴维·福尔写道：“1967 年的暴动是人们首次公开反对既定政府，但对许多人来说，示威、炸弹和零星的骚乱印证了他们从报刊上了解到的文化大革命的种种暴行。” 20 被迫在中华人民共和国和香港之间做出选择，大多数香港人认同殖民政权是他们的政府。与此同时，他们越来越觉得自己是一个特殊群体的成员，既与殖民政府有所区别，也与大陆的同胞有所区别。 +



The disturbances also prompted demands in Britain and Hong Kong for the colonial government to improve labor relations, foster a sense of belonging, improve communication between government and people, and expand education—not in the least so that youths would not be so vulnerable to political indoctrination.  +
The local press expressed concern that the Emergency Regulations might be continued and criticism of the Labour Department for not being able to intervene in labor disputes.  +
Questions arose about how to deal with the arrested leftists: many residents wanted the death penalty for those involved in the bombings, but others argued that many of the activists were young and had been misguided by committee leaders who had walked away scot-free.  +
Some of the convicted defendants received very stiff punishments.  +
For example, a fourteen-year-old boy received four years for carrying a bomb, and a fifty-four-year-old man was given five years for participating in a riot in Sha Tau Kok.
这些骚乱也促使英国和香港民众要求殖民政府改善劳资关系、增强民众归属感、加强政府与民众沟通并扩大教育规模——尤其要避免青少年更容易受到政治灌输的影响。当地媒体担忧《紧急规例》可能会继续实施，并批评劳工处未能介入劳资纠纷。如何处置被捕的左翼人士也引发了争议：许多居民希望对参与爆炸案的人判处死刑，但也有人认为，许多活动人士年纪尚轻，受到了委员会领导人的误导，而这些领导人却逍遥法外。一些被告被判处重刑。例如，一名14岁男孩因携带炸弹被判处4年监禁，一名54岁男子因参与沙头角暴乱被判处5年监禁。 +



Governor Trench’s administration had shown that it would not tolerate such disturbances, but it also realized that it needed to “close the gap” between government and people.  +
This resulted in several administrative changes designed to reduce the political alienation of Hong Kong’s population and to help prevent further disturbances.  +
The City District Officer system, based on the District Officer program used in the New Territories since the early 1900s, appointed district officers to mediate between government and people.  +
These officers were to “assist those suffering from a sense of grievance to present their cases coherently and, when necessary, to act as their advocate.”21 Public relations within government departments were improved and various advisory committees expanded, while unofficial members of the Legislative and Executive Councils were given larger roles.  +
By renaming the position of Secretary for Chinese Affairs as the Secretary for Home Affairs in 1969, the government admitted that the overwhelming majority of Hong Kong’s population could not be treated as a distinct group.  +
The government also made plans for compulsory free public education and more social welfare and labor legislation (for example, in 1970 a mandatory weekly day off was finally introduced).  +
Although many of these reforms would not be implemented until the early 1970s under Trench’s successor, Murray MacLehose, “1967 marked a crucial turning point in the development of the colonial regime’s irreversible awareness of and irrevocable commitment to a more conscientious and responsive social policy with greater care and concern for the grass-roots community.”22 Hong Kong would not experience serious civil unrest again until January 1984, when taxi drivers rioted briefly in Mongkok, in Kowloon.
特伦奇总督的政府已表明其不容忍此类骚乱，但也意识到需要“弥合”政府与民众之间的鸿沟。这促成了一系列旨在减少香港民众政治疏离感并防止进一步骚乱的行政改革。以新界自 20 世纪初以来使用的区长制度为基础，设立了区长制度，任命区长在政府与民众之间进行调解。这些区长“协助心怀不满者清晰地陈述案情，并在必要时为其辩护”。 21 政府部门内部的公共关系得到改善，各类咨询委员会规模扩大，立法会和行政会的非官方成员也被赋予了更大的权力。1969 年，政府将中国事务局局长更名为民政事务局局长，这表明政府承认香港绝大多数民众不能被视为一个独立的群体。政府还制定了义务免费公共教育计划，以及更多社会福利和劳动立法（例如，1970 年终于引入了每周一天的强制性休息日）。尽管其中许多改革直到 20 世纪 70 年代初特伦奇的继任者默里·麦克莱霍斯执政时期才得以实施，但“1967 年标志着殖民政权发展历程中一个关键的转折点，它不可逆转地意识到并坚定地致力于制定一项更加负责任、更贴近基层社区的社会政策。”“ 22 香港直到 1984 年 1 月才再次发生严重的社会动荡，当时旺角的出租车司机发生了短暂的骚乱。在九龙。 +



However, the 1967 disturbances effectively shelved Trench’s plans for constitutional reforms.  +
After talk in Britain about expanding political representation in Hong Kong, in 1964 Trench, who had arrived that year intent on political reform, had established a committee to consider the possibility of an elected Legislative Council.  +
But in 1967 the British government announced that because of Hong Kong’s unique geographic and political status, an elected council would be out of the question, especially given the turbulent conditions in China and the tense Sino-British relations during the Cultural Revolution.  +
The buzzword now was “consultation,” using advisory committees rather than votes to reach a consensus.  +
Justifying Hong Kong’s lack of democracy, Trench argued in 1969 that “there is no one brand of politics, or one line of policies, which is right for all places at all stages of development.”23
然而，1967 年的骚乱实际上搁置了特伦奇的宪政改革计划。1964 年，特伦奇抵达香港，决心进行政治改革。此前，英国曾讨论过扩大香港的政治代表权。同年，他成立了一个委员会，探讨设立民选立法会的可能性。但 1967 年，英国政府宣布，鉴于香港独特的地理和政治地位，设立民选立法会是不可能的，尤其是在当时中国局势动荡、文化大革命期间中英关系紧张的情况下。如今的流行语是“咨询”，即通过咨询委员会而非投票来达成共识。1969 年，特伦奇为香港缺乏民主辩护，他认为“没有一种政治模式或政策路线适用于所有地区和所有发展阶段”。 23 +
Nor should the government’s attempts to “close the gap” be exaggerated.  +
Although proposals were offered for an ombudsman post that would investigate complaints against maladministration, such a post—the commissioner for administrative complaints—would not materialize until 1989.  +
When the government introduced the Official Language Ordinance in 1974 making Chinese an official language, it did so mainly in response to demands from local activists.  +
Government policy papers and internal documents continued to be written completely in English for another twenty years, while laws were not issued in Chinese until 1989.  +
As late as 1995, English was still the only language in the higher courts, and Chinese defendants still received summonses in English.
政府为“缩小差距”所做的努力也不应被夸大。尽管曾有人提议设立监察专员一职，负责调查针对行政不当行为的投诉，但直到1989年，这一职位——行政申诉专员——才得以设立。1974年，政府颁布《官方语言条例》，将中文定为官方语言，这主要是应当地活动人士的要求。此后二十年间，政府政策文件和内部文件仍然全部使用英文撰写，而法律直到1989年才开始以中文颁布。直至1995年，英文仍然是高等法院的唯一语言，中国被告收到的传票也仍然是英文的。 +



BUILDING THE WELFARE STATE
建设福利国家
Until the early 1970s, the Hong Kong government had tried to spend as little as possible on social services.  +
As a 1965 government white paper put it, “The economic well-being of any community demands that as far as possible every resident contributes to, rather than draws upon, its resources.” Contrary to the common view of Hong Kong as a laissez-faire capitalist paradise, however, the government played an increasingly critical role in Hong Kong’s economy in the 1960s and 1970s.  +
The 1967 disturbances convinced senior officials in Britain and Hong Kong that they would have to improve social conditions if they intended to maintain British rule in Hong Kong, especially given the anti-imperialist rhetoric coming from China during the Cultural Revolution, from other British colonies, and even from within Britain.  +
The Star Ferry riots had revealed the discontent generated by social and economic conditions, while the disturbances of 1967 had shown how this discontent could fuel political tensions.
直到20世纪70年代初，香港政府一直试图尽可能减少社会服务方面的支出。正如1965年的一份政府白皮书所言，“任何社区的经济福祉都要求每个居民尽可能地为社区资源做出贡献，而不是消耗资源。”然而，与人们普遍认为香港是自由放任的资本主义天堂的观点相反，在20世纪60年代和70年代，政府在香港经济中扮演着日益重要的角色。1967年的骚乱使英国和香港的高级官员确信，如果他们想要维持英国在香港的统治，就必须改善社会状况，尤其是在文化大革命期间来自中国、其他英国殖民地甚至英国国内的反帝言论甚嚣尘上的情况下。天星小轮骚乱揭示了社会和经济状况引发的不满，而1967年的骚乱则表明，这种不满会如何加剧政治紧张局势。 +



The main engineer of the Hong Kong government’s new “‘positive nonintervention’ policy” was John Cowperthwaite, financial secretary from 1961 to 1971.  +
Unlike his contemporaries in Britain, Cowperthwaite believed that the economy was best left to businessmen and that government should intervene as little as possible.  +
Still, he felt that government had an obligation to provide public works, public education, medical services, and housing to those truly in need.  +
During his tenure, real wages rose by 50 percent, and the percentage of impoverished families dropped from around 50 percent to around 15 percent.  +
Nevertheless, Cowperthwaite helped to delay the offering of free and compulsory primary education and to thwart a plan for expanded welfare reform, including workers’ retirement and insurance.  +
Living conditions in the new resettlement estates could be dismal (with fifty residents sharing one communal bathroom).  +
Although Queen Mary Hospital, opened in 1963, was the largest hospital in the Commonwealth, clinics and hospitals remained overcrowded, with patients sometimes even sharing a bed.  +
Many children had no formal education, and compulsory free education was not introduced until 1971 for the primary level and 1978 for the secondary level.
香港政府新“积极不干预”政策的主要推手是1961年至1971年担任财政司司长的约翰·考珀斯韦特。与英国同时代的官员不同，考珀斯韦特认为经济最好交给商人管理，政府应尽可能少地干预。但他同时认为，政府有义务为真正需要帮助的人提供公共工程、公共教育、医疗服务和住房。在他任职期间，实际工资增长了50%，贫困家庭的比例从约50%下降到约15%。然而，考珀斯韦特却拖延了免费义务小学教育的实施，并阻挠了一项扩大福利改革的计划，其中包括工人退休和保险。新建安置屋区的居住条件可能十分恶劣（五十名居民共用一个公共浴室）。尽管玛丽女王医院于1963年开业，是当时英联邦最大的医院，但诊所和医院仍然人满为患，病人有时甚至需要共用一张床。许多儿童没有接受过正规教育，义务免费教育直到1971年才开始在小学阶段实施，1978年才开始在中学阶段实施。 +



Given the problems and conditions of the 1960s, many people in Hong Kong found the administration of Murray MacLehose “almost too good to be true.”24 The first Hong Kong governor to be chosen from among career diplomats in the Foreign Office rather than from the colonial service, MacLehose had been consul in Hankou after World War II and then ambassador to Saigon and Copenhagen; he had also been political advisor to Governor Robert Black in the early 1960s.  +
MacLehose tried hard to evince a noncolonial image—walking to the Legislative Council chambers from Government House rather than taking the governor’s limousine, meeting and talking to ordinary people, and wearing short-sleeved, open-necked shirts while strolling through local neighborhoods.  +
Elsie Tu recalls MacLehose as a “different kind of Governor, being a diplomat, not a colonial official of the old school that cared little about the rights of the local people in the colonies they ruled.”25
鉴于 20 世纪 60 年代的种种问题和状况，许多香港人觉得麦理浩的执政“好得令人难以置信”。 24 麦理浩是首位从外交部职业外交官而非殖民地官员中选出的香港总督。二战后，他曾任驻汉口领事，后又担任驻西贡和哥本哈根大使；20 世纪 60 年代初，他还曾担任罗伯特·布莱克总督的政治顾问。麦理浩努力展现其非殖民主义形象——他从政府大楼步行前往立法会，而不是乘坐总督的专车；他会见并与普通民众交谈；在社区漫步时，他身穿短袖敞领衬衫。艾尔西·图回忆说，麦理浩是一位“与众不同的总督，他是一位外交官，而不是那种对殖民地人民的权利漠不关心的旧式殖民官员。” 25 +
Unlike his predecessors, MacLehose found the concept of welfare appealing, as long as it was economically feasible and not abused.  +
His administration saw a massive expansion of public housing, free comprehensive primary education, public assistance, transport, labor legislation, and social welfare.  +
MacLehose was a master at publicizing his programs with bold promises.  +
He claimed, for example, that his Ten Years Housing Scheme would end squatter areas and eliminate overcrowding.  +
Ambitious as this claim was, other reforms, especially in education and health, gave his administration a good image.  +
By 1983, more than 40 percent of Hong Kong’s population lived in government housing, mainly large complexes of high-rise blocks.  +
MacLehose’s government also began a complex of new towns, or satellite towns, in the New Territories.  +
Intended to be self-contained communities rather than simply residential units, each town would include schools, shops, restaurants, and recreation areas as well as space for industry.  +
Under MacLehose, the civil service expanded by more than 70 percent, from almost 102,000 in 1973 to almost 174,000 in 1983.  +
Faced with widespread environmental degradation, in 1976 MacLehose’s government established a network of country parks.  +
(Hong Kong’s longest hiking route, the MacLehose Trail, is named after the governor.)
与前任不同，麦理浩认为福利制度很有吸引力，只要它在经济上可行且不被滥用。在他的领导下，公共房屋、免费小学教育、公共援助、交通运输、劳工立法和社会福利都得到了大规模的扩张。麦理浩擅长用大胆的承诺来宣传他的各项计划。例如，他声称他的“十年房屋计划”将消除棚户区和人口拥挤问题。尽管这一承诺雄心勃勃，但其他改革，尤其是在教育和卫生领域的改革，为他的政府赢得了良好的形象。到1983年，超过40%的香港人口居住在政府房屋中，这些房屋主要是大型的高层住宅楼。麦理浩政府还在新界启动了一系列新市镇或卫星市镇的建设。这些市镇旨在成为自给自足的社区，而不仅仅是住宅单元，每个市镇都将包括学校、商店、餐馆、休闲场所和工业用地。在麦理浩执政期间，公务员队伍扩充超过70%，从1973年的近10.2万人增至1983年的近17.4万人。面对普遍存在的环境恶化问题，麦理浩政府于1976年建立了郊野公园网络。（香港最长的远足路线麦理浩径，即以这位总督的名字命名。） +
MacLehose clearly represented a departure from the old colonial-style governor.  +
Many of his reforms, however, had been conceived earlier under Trench, partly as a response to the unrest in 1966 and 1967.  +
MacLehose’s reforms also benefited greatly from Hong Kong’s changing economic and geopolitical status.  +
When he arrived in November 1971, Hong Kong had already recovered from the 1967 disturbances.  +
Prime Minister Harold Wilson’s Labour government was more concerned with social issues and workers’ rights than was the Conservative Party, which had ruled Britain in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  +
Philip Haddon-Cave, who succeeded Cowperthwaite under MacLehose, subtly departed from his predecessor’s conservative economic policy.  +
From 1970 to 1972, government expenditures increased by more than 50 percent, setting a pattern that steadily spiraled upward.  +
In 1970–1971, social welfare spending was HK$40 million; it was more than $2.5 billion in 1986–1987 and more than $15 billion in 1996–1997.
麦理浩显然代表着与旧式殖民地总督截然不同的风格。然而，他的许多改革措施早在特伦奇时期就已构思，部分原因是为了应对1966年和1967年的动乱。麦理浩的改革也得益于香港经济和地缘政治地位的转变。1971年11月他到任时，香港已经从1967年的动乱中恢复过来。与20世纪50年代末和60年代初执政的保守党相比，哈罗德·威尔逊领导的工党政府更加关注社会问题和工人权益。在麦理浩领导下接替考珀斯韦特的菲利普·哈登-凯夫，巧妙地偏离了其前任的保守经济政策。从1970年到1972年，政府支出增长超过50%，并由此开启了持续螺旋式上升的趋势。 1970-1971年，社会福利支出为4000万港元；1986-1987年超过25亿港元；1996-1997年超过150亿港元。 +

MacLehose also happened to be in Hong Kong during a period of remarkable economic growth.  +
By the late 1960s, Hong Kong had all the ingredients for a successful economy: strong trade networks and a solid industrial base, a modern international banking system, good public services, and a relatively educated workforce.  +
Its large population, increased by the number of immigrants from China, meant more producers and consumers.  +
The colony’s gross domestic product grew at an average of 10 percent per year from the 1960s through the 1970s and then by five times from the early 1970s to the early 1980s.  +
Hong Kong’s economy benefited immensely from the growth of real estate development, led mainly by Chinese entrepreneurs such as Li Ka-shing, an immigrant from Guangdong who had begun his career in plastics and property, as well as from a large influx of foreign investment, especially from Japan and the United States.  +
By the late 1970s, Chinese firms had begun to eclipse the old British hongs, and Chinese entrepreneurs had founded three new stock exchanges to compete with the European-dominated Hong Kong Stock Exchange founded in the 1880s (the four stock markets merged in 1986).  +
In 1979, Y.  +
K.  +
Pao, a shipping magnate who had started his business in the 1950s with only one small vessel, bought out the Hong Kong and Kowloon Wharf and Godown Company, a subsidiary of Jardine and Matheson founded in 1889.  +
In 1980, Li Ka-shing acquired Hutchison-Whampoa, a local British giant originally established in the 1870s in docks and shipping.
麦理浩恰好在香港生活期间，正值香港经济蓬勃发展的时期。到了 20 世纪 60 年代末，香港已具备经济成功所需的一切要素：强大的贸易网络​​和稳固的工业基础、现代化的国际银行体系、良好的公共服务以及相对高素质的劳动力。庞大的人口，加上来自中国内地的移民，意味着更多的生产者和消费者。从 20 世纪 60 年代到 70 年代，香港的国内生产总值年均增长 10%，而从 70 年代初到 80 年代初，更是增长了五倍。香港经济受益于房地产开发的巨大发展，这主要得益于像李嘉诚这样的中国企业家。李嘉诚是一位来自广东的移民，他的事业始于塑料和房地产行业。此外，大量外资的涌入，尤其是来自日本和美国的投资，也极大地促进了香港经济的发展。到了 20 世纪 70 年代末，中国企业开始超越老牌英资香港公司，中国企业家也创办了三家新的证券交易所，与 19 世纪 80 年代成立、由欧洲人主导的香港证券交易所展开竞争（这四家证券交易所于 1986 年合并）。1979 年，航运巨头包玉佳（YK Pao）收购了怡和洋行旗下的香港九龙码头仓库公司（该公司成立于 1889 年），包玉佳于 20 世纪 50 年代以一艘小船起家。1980 年，李嘉诚收购了和记黄埔，这家英国本土巨头最初于 19 世纪 70 年代在码头和航运业起家。 +



Furthermore, MacLehose was the first postwar governor who did not have to worry about tensions with China.  +
Britain and China had begun negotiations for normalizing relations during Prime Minister Edward Heath’s administration.  +
Relations between Britain and China became even better after China began its open door policy in the late 1970s and started to play a larger role in Hong Kong’s economy.  +
Whereas in 1972 the United States and Britain were Hong Kong’s first and second most important markets, by 1986 China had become its second-largest market (the United States was still the largest, while Britain had dropped to fourth place).  +
In 1972, Japan and China were Hong Kong’s top two sources of imports; Britain was number four.  +
By 1981, China had overtaken Japan as Hong Kong’s largest source of imports.  +
By 1986, Britain had dropped to Hong Kong’s seventh-largest source of imports.  +
In overall terms, by 1986 Hong Kong was doing more business with China than with any other country.
此外，麦理浩是战后首位无需担忧与中国关系紧张的港督。英国和中国在首相希思执政期间就开始了关系正常化的谈判。20世纪70年代末，中国实行改革开放政策，并在香港经济中扮演越来越重要的角色，此后英中关系进一步改善。1972年，美国和英国分别是香港第一和第二大市场；到1986年，中国已成为香港第二大市场（美国仍是第一大市场，英国则跌至第四位）。1972年，日本和中国是香港前两大进口来源国，英国位列第四。到1981年，中国已超越日本，成为香港最大的进口来源国。到1986年，英国已跌至香港第七大进口来源国。总体而言，到1986年，香港与中国的贸易额超过了与其他任何国家的贸易额。 +



MacLehose has often been criticized—as he was during his tenure—for not introducing political reforms.  +
Indeed, Hong Kong’s constitutional structure saw little change.  +
Until 1981, the Urban Council was the only council that was elected.  +
MacLehose rejected suggestions from senior officials to change the shape of the Legislative Council.  +
Almost half of the members of the Legislative Council were government officials, and the unofficial members represented a tiny portion of the population.  +
The Executive Council consisted mainly of senior government officials and appointees who represented business interests, especially those of the old British firms.  +
As journalist Richard Hughes cheerfully put it, “there is no nonsense about democracy in Hong Kong.  +
Administration and legislation are conducted along unashamed colonial lines.”26 However, during MacLehose’s tenure some Legislative Council members were appointed from the lower classes, while in 1976 he gave the unofficial Legislative Council members a majority simply by not appointing the full quota of official members.  +
The District Administration Scheme, introduced in 1981, aimed to provide an effective forum for public consultation and participation in administration at the district level.  +
Although the District Boards introduced during MacLehose’s tenure were only partly elected and had no authority to pass legislation or make policies, they nevertheless played an advisory role.
麦理浩经常因未推行政治改革而受到批评——正如他在任期间所遭遇的那样。事实上，香港的宪制结构几乎没有改变。直到 1981 年，市政局是唯一由民选产生的议会。麦​​理浩拒绝了高级官员提出的改变立法会组成的建议。立法会成员几乎一半是政府官员，而非官方成员仅代表极少数人口。行政会议主要由高级政府官员和代表商业利益（尤其是老牌英国公司利益）的委任官员组成。正如记者理查德·休斯（Richard Hughes）所言，“香港的民主毫无花招。行政和立法完全是按照毫不掩饰的殖民模式进行的。” 26 然而，在麦理浩任期内，一些立法会议员是从下层阶级中委任的，而在 1976 年，他通过不任命全部名额的官方议员，使非官方立法会成员获得了多数席位。 1981 年推出的地区行政制度旨在为公众在地区层面参与行政事务提供有效的咨询和参与平台。尽管麦理浩任期内设立的地区委员会成员部分由选举产生，且无权立法或制定政策，但它们仍然发挥着咨询作用。 +



MacLehose’s reforms should not, however, overshadow some of the less impressive aspects of his tenure.  +
Despite his efforts to improve relations between government and people, the colonial government frequently spied on reformist and pressure groups such as the Hong Kong Observers, the Education Action Group, the Christian Industrial Committee, and the Society for Community Organisation, and it bugged the telephones of political and social activists, often trying to intimidate them by denouncing them as radical leftists.  +
Expatriates held more than half of the senior posts in the civil service until the mid-1980s, often justifying the reluctance to hire local Chinese on the grounds that they did not have the right character, aptitude, outlook, or interest in public affairs.  +
As Leo Goodstadt writes, the “separation of government from the people was aggravated by the restricted role of local Chinese men and women in the government and the way that the most senior and sensitive posts in the Civil Service were monopolized by expatriates until the final decade of British rule.”27
然而，麦理浩的改革不应掩盖他任期内一些不太光彩的方面。尽管他努力改善政府与民众的关系，殖民政府却经常监视香港观察家、教育行动小组、基督教产业委员会和社区组织协会等改革派团体和压力团体，并窃听政治和社会活动人士的电话，常常试图通过谴责他们是激进左派来恐吓他们。直到 20 世纪 80 年代中期，公务员队伍中超过一半的高级职位都由外籍人士担任，这常常成为不愿雇用本地华人的理由，认为他们缺乏合适的品格、才能、视野或对公共事务的兴趣。正如利奥·古斯塔特所写，“由于本地华人在政府中的角色受到限制，以及公务员队伍中最高级和最敏感的职位在英国统治的最后十年之前一直被外籍人士垄断，政府与人民的分离现象更加严重。” 27 +
Nor should the remarkable improvements in living standards during the 1970s and 1980s obscure some of the tragedies and disappointments.  +
In June 1972, for example, more than 250 people were killed in landslides after some forty inches of rain fell in four days.  +
After the Communist victory and unification of Vietnam in 1975, some 70,000 Vietnamese boat people came to Hong Kong as refugees.  +
Captured brilliantly by local director Ann Hui in a 1982 film, Boat People, their plight drew some sympathy from Hong Kong people, but their presence also provoked resentment and hostility, especially as these refugees strained already tight social services and housing facilities.  +
In July 1982, large numbers of Vietnamese refugees were held in closed camps run by the Correctional Services and designed as deterrents to more refugees.  +
Despite efforts to resettle the refugees in host countries or persuade them to return voluntarily to Vietnam, the camps remained until 1992.  +
Well into the late 1980s, Hong Kong still had many homeless people, not to mention some 400,000 squatters living in huts in the hillsides.  +
During Chinese New Year in the winter of 1986, a huge fire in Chu Ku Tsai village, New Territories, left 2,000 people homeless.
20 世纪 70 年代和 80 年代生活水平的显著提高不应掩盖一些悲剧和令人失望的事件。例如，1972 年 6 月，四天内降雨量达 40 英寸，引发山体滑坡，造成 250 多人死亡。1975 年越南共产党取得胜利并实现统一后，约有 7 万名越南船民作为难民来到香港。香港导演许鞍华在 1982 年拍摄的电影 《船民》出色地展现了他们的困境， 赢得了部分香港市民的同情，但他们的到来也引发了不满和敌意，尤其是在这些难民给本已捉襟见肘的社会服务和住房设施带来更大压力的情况下。1982 年 7 月，大量越南难民被关押在惩教署设立的封闭营地中，这些营地旨在阻止更多难民涌入。尽管当局努力将难民安置到收容国或劝说他们自愿返回越南，但难民营一直持续到 1992 年。直到 20 世纪 80 年代末，香港仍然有很多无家可归的人，更不用说还有大约 40 万棚户区居民居住在山坡上的茅屋里。1986 年冬春之际，新界竹谷寨村发生大火，导致 2000 人无家可归。 +
