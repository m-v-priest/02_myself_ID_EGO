Becoming Hong Kongese  成为香港人
The social, economic, and political changes of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s had important consequences for the growth of a distinctively Hong Kong identity.  +
Most scholars argue that this identity did not emerge until after the Communist revolution of 1949.  +
According to this argument, because most Chinese in Hong Kong before 1949 were sojourners, they identified primarily with China.  +
However, because most people born in Hong Kong after 1950 had little experience of China and were born to parents who had fled from there, they were less likely to identify with the People’s Republic of China (PRC), especially with its Communist government.  +
Governor Alexander Grantham wrote in 1962 that whereas in the past the “majority of Chinese” had “little loyalty to Hong Kong,” the “picture is changing since China went communist, as few Chinese in Hong Kong now intend to return to the country of their birth.  +
They are becoming permanent citizens.”1 Especially during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, Hong Kong people contrasted the political stability and economic freedom in Hong Kong with the repression and chaos in China.  +
Thus, during the 1960s and 1970s more locally born Chinese started to see Hong Kong as their home.
20 世纪 50 年代、60 年代和 70 年代的社会、经济和政治变革对香港独特身份的形成产生了重要影响。大多数学者认为，这种身份认同直到 1949 年共产党革命之后才出现。根据这种观点，由于 1949 年以前在香港的大多数华人都是旅居者，他们主要认同的是中国。然而，由于 1950 年以后在香港出生的大多数人对中国知之甚少，而且他们的父母是从中国逃亡而来，因此他们不太可能认同中华人民共和国，尤其是其共产党政府。港督亚历山大·格兰瑟姆在 1962 年写道，虽然过去“大多数华人”对香港“缺乏忠诚”，但“自从中国实行共产主义以来，情况正在发生变化，因为现在很少有香港华人打算返回他们的出生地。他们正在成为永久居民。” 尤其是在大跃进和文化大革命期间，香港人将香港的政治稳定和经济自由与中国大陆的压迫和混乱进行了对比。因此，在 20 世纪 60 年代和 70 年代，越来越多的本地中国人开始将香港视为自己的家园。 +



A sense of local identity had in fact emerged by the late 1800s, when many wealthy Chinese in Hong Kong came to see themselves as permanent residents and as a special kind of Chinese, separate from their counterparts on the mainland.  +
This sense of belonging became even stronger after the 1911 republican revolution and the revolutionary nationalism of the 1920s, especially during the general strike of 1925–1926.  +
However, it was during the 1960s and 1970s that other parts of the population also began to identify more closely with Hong Kong.  +
This was not a matter of a Hong Kong identity trickling down from the top.  +
Rather, this sense of belonging was shaped by several factors, among them Hong Kong’s rising economic prosperity, its closer ties with China, and the efforts of the colonial government to foster a sense of local identity.  +
Perhaps what most shaped this sense of Hong Kong identity, however, was the realization in the early 1980s that Hong Kong would revert to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
事实上，早在19世纪末，香港就已萌生了本土认同感。当时，许多富裕的香港华人开始将自己视为永久居民，并认为自己是与大陆华人不同的特殊群体。1911年共和革命和20世纪20年代的革命民族主义运动，尤其是1925-1926年的香港大罢工，进一步强化了这种归属感。然而，直到20世纪60年代和70年代，香港其他地区的居民才开始更加紧密地认同香港。这并非香港认同感自上而下形成的。相反，这种归属感是由多种因素共同塑造的，其中包括香港日益繁荣的经济、与中国大陆日益紧密的联系，以及殖民政府为培养本土认同感所做的努力。然而，或许对香港认同感影响最大的，是20世纪80年代初人们意识到香港将于1997年回归中国。 +



ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS
经济、社会和文化发展
This sense of Hong Kong identity had strong economic roots.  +
In 1973, Hong Kong’s gross domestic product (GDP) had risen by 117 percent since 1968.  +
By the 1970s, more people could afford to buy apartments and to invest in Hong Kong’s economy.  +
More money and time for leisure meant new opportunities for traveling abroad, which enabled them to compare Hong Kong with other parts of the world.  +
With the increased economic prosperity came a rising interest in culture, from Cantonese opera to the annual Hong Kong Arts Festival, featuring orchestras from Europe and performing arts from across the globe.  +
In the late 1970s and 1980s, the government spent more on promoting the arts, shown in the establishment of the Arts Centre in 1979, the Academy for the Performing Arts in 1984, and the Hong Kong Museum of Art in 1985.
这种香港认同感有着深厚的经济根基。1973 年，香港的本地生产总值（GDP）较 1968 年增长了 117%。到了 20 世纪 70 年代，更多人有能力购买公寓并投资香港经济。更多的金钱和休闲时间意味着出国旅行的新机遇，使他们能够将香港与世界其他地区进行比较。随着经济的繁荣，人们对文化的兴趣日益浓厚，从粤剧到一年一度的香港艺术节，汇聚了来自欧洲的乐团和世界各地的表演艺术。在 20 世纪 70 年代末和 80 年代，政府加大了对艺术发展的投入，这体现在 1979 年艺术中心、1984 年演艺学院和 1985 年香港艺术馆的成立。 +



Hong Kong’s rapid economic development from the early 1970s to the 1980s also led to the rise of a local popular culture expressed in film, music, and television shows.  +
The year 1974 saw the creation of Canto-pop, sentimental love songs with Cantonese lyrics backed by Western-style pop music.  +
The explosion of the local film industry in the late 1960s and early 1970s led by the Shaw Brothers Studios (established in 1961 by Run Run Shaw, who made his film fortune in Singapore) and Golden Harvest Studios (cofounded by ex-Shaw executive Raymond Chow) was embodied in the short but dynamic career of Bruce Lee, whose 1972 film The Way of the Dragon both popularized kung fu and put Hong Kong on the cinematic map.  +
(Lee died in 1973 from a cerebral hemorrhage.) The first Jackie Chan movie, Snake in the Eagle’s Shadow (1978) was a big hit.  +
In 1983 Tsui Hark’s Zu Warrior from the Magic Mountain became a landmark in special effects for Hong Kong film.  +
In the late 1980s, Wong Kar-wai, who made his directorial debut with As Tears Go By (1988), created a new form of expressionistic, melodramatic cinema, while John Woo’s A Better Tomorrow (1986) pioneered a genre of police-and-gangster cinema that would later inspire Hollywood filmmakers.  +
It also became clear that Hong Kong had some cultural, social, and economic influence on China.  +
In the 1980s, for example, Hong Kong film, pop songs, and radio and television programs became popular in Guangdong, often to the dismay of local authorities who worried about this so-called spiritual pollution.  +
Hong Kong’s Cantonese language had long possessed its own idiosyncrasies, but these differences became even more pronounced in the 1970s and 1980s, as words from Hong Kong Cantonese, such as dih-see (taxi) and see-daw (store), began to creep into the Guangdong vocabulary.
从 20 世纪 70 年代初到 80 年代，香港经济的飞速发展也催生了本土流行文化的兴起，并体现在电影、音乐和电视节目中。1974 年，粤语流行音乐（Canto-pop）诞生，这种音乐以粤语歌词搭配西式流行音乐，创作出充满柔情的爱情歌曲。20 世纪 60 年代末至 70 年代初，在邵氏兄弟电影公司（由在新加坡发迹的邵逸夫于 1961 年创立）和嘉禾电影公司（由前邵氏高管邹文怀联合创办）的引领下，香港电影业蓬勃发展。李小龙短暂而辉煌的演艺生涯正是这一发展历程的缩影。他 1972 年的电影 《猛龙过江》 不仅使功夫电影风靡全球，也让香港电影在世界影坛占据了一席之地。 （李小龙于 1973 年因脑溢血去世。）成龙的首部电影 《蛇形刁手 》（1978）大获成功。1983 年，徐克的 《蜀山传》 成为香港电影特效的里程碑之作。20 世纪 80 年代末，王家卫凭借处女作 《泪痕》 （1988）开创了一种新的表现主义、情节剧式的电影风格，而吴宇森的 《英雄本色 》（1986）则开创了警匪片的先河，这一类型后来启发了好莱坞电影人。香港对中国大陆的文化、社会和经济影响也日益凸显。例如，20 世纪 80 年代，香港电影、流行歌曲以及广播电视节目在广东广受欢迎，这常常令当地政府感到担忧，他们担心这种所谓的“精神污染”。 香港粤语长期以来都有其独特的特点，但到了 20 世纪 70 年代和 80 年代，这些差异变得更加明显，因为香港粤语中的一些词汇，如 dih-see （出租车）和 see-daw （商店），开始渗入广东词汇中。 +



Many local people became proud of Hong Kong’s hybrid status: its blend of Chinese and Western culture and its emphasis on both traditional Chinese values such as family and education and on modern Western values such as economic freedom and the rule of law.  +
With the establishment of Hong Kong Polytechnic and Chinese University (an amalgamation of three separate schools, New Asia College, Chung Chi College, and United College) in the New Territories, Hong Kong’s population was becoming more educated.  +
By the 1970s, many educated people were taking jobs locally instead of going overseas.  +
Hong Kong had also become more cosmopolitan rather than just Chinese and British.  +
American popular culture, which had been introduced mainly during the 1950s, became even more influential during the 1960s and 1970s, partly through the large numbers of American military personnel who came to Hong Kong during the Vietnam War but mostly through the media.  +
Hollywood films had always had a widespread influence on Hong Kong, but in the 1960s and 1970s a generation of Hong Kong people grew up watching American television programs dubbed into Cantonese.  +
The first McDonald’s restaurant opened in 1975 in Causeway Bay on Hong Kong Island; by the late 1990s, Hong Kong would have some one hundred McDonald’s restaurants, including four of the world’s busiest branches.  +
And even while some local activists protested Japan’s claims to the Diaoyutai (Senkaku) Islands, eight uninhabited islands located in the East China Sea and claimed by both China and Japan, from the 1970s on things Japanese became more popular, especially as the younger generation had no memory of World War II.  +
Japanese department stores were popular shopping venues, while children enjoyed watching dubbed Japanese cartoons and science fiction television programs.
许多本地居民为香港的多元文化身份感到自豪：它融合了中西文化，既重视家庭和教育等传统中国价值观，也重视经济自由和法治等现代西方价值观。随着香港理工大学（由新亚书院、崇基书院和联合书院三所学校合并而成）在新界成立，香港人口的教育水平不断提高。到了20世纪70年代，许多受过良好教育的人选择在本地就业，而不是出国发展。香港也变得更加国际化，不再仅仅局限于华人和英国人。美国流行文化主要在20世纪50年代传入香港，并在60年代和70年代的影响力进一步增强，这部分得益于越战期间大量驻港美军，但更主要的原因是媒体的传播。好莱坞电影对香港的影响一直很广泛，但在上世纪六七十年代，一代香港人看着配音成粤语的美国电视节目长大。第一家麦当劳餐厅于1975年在香港岛铜锣湾开业；到上世纪九十年代末，香港已有约一百家麦当劳餐厅，其中包括全球最繁忙的四家分店。尽管一些本地活动人士抗议日本对钓鱼岛（尖阁诸岛）的主权声索——钓鱼岛是位于东海的八个无人居住的岛屿，中日两国均声称拥有主权——但从上世纪七十年代起，日本文化越来越受欢迎，尤其是在年轻一代对二战没有记忆的情况下。 日本百货商店是当时很受欢迎的购物场所。孩子们则喜欢观看配音的日本动画片和科幻电视节目。 +



From the late 1970s on, Hong Kong and Guangdong became increasingly reintegrated in a symbiotic relationship shaped by Guangdong’s inexpensive labor and land and Hong Kong’s capital and extensive international connections.  +
Hong Kong’s business knowledge and connections in the capitalist world helped China’s economic reforms through investment, finance, and trade.  +
Hong Kong investors poured money into Guangdong and began to open factories there, especially in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone established in 1982.  +
By the late 1980s, more than three million mainlanders were working for Hong Kong firms in Guangdong.  +
China’s economic reforms thus helped transform Hong Kong from a manufacturing base for light industrial goods such as electronics into a leading financial and service center.  +
Whereas in the late 1970s the service sector made up less than 65 percent of Hong Kong’s CDP, by the mid-1990s it accounted for almost 85 percent.  +
By the mid-1990s, some 90 percent of Hong Kong factories had moved to China, with manufacturing counting for less than 10 percent of Hong Kong’s GDP.  +
(This transfer of production to China had a significant socioeconomic impact on Hong Kong.  +
The biggest devaluation of skills was for blue-collar women workers, since men were more able to find work as foremen across the border.  +
Coupled with the emphasis on academic credentials for good jobs in the service sector, this increased income inequalities in Hong Kong.)
自 20 世纪 70 年代末以来，香港和广东日益融合，形成了一种互利共生的关系。这种关系的形成得益于广东廉价的劳动力和土地，以及香港的资本和广泛的国际联系。香港的商业知识和在资本主义世界的人脉关系，通过投资、金融和贸易，助力了中国的经济改革。香港投资者大量涌入广东，并在那里开设工厂，尤其是在 1982 年成立的深圳经济特区。到 20 世纪 80 年代末，超过 300 万内地人在广东为香港企业工作。中国的经济改革由此推动香港从电子产品等轻工业产品的制造基地转型为领先的金融和服务中心。20 世纪 70 年代末，服务业在香港人口普查区（CDP）中所占比例不到 65%，而到 20 世纪 90 年代中期，这一比例已接近 85%。到 20 世纪 90 年代中期，香港约 90%的工厂已迁往中国内地，制造业在香港 GDP 中的占比不足 10%。（生产转移至中国内地对香港的社会经济产生了重大影响。技能贬值最严重的是蓝领女工，因为男性更容易在中国内地找到工头的工作。加之服务业对学历的重视，这加剧了香港的收入不平等。） +
As China became more open to the outside world in the late 1970s and early 1980s, visits to the PRC showed Hong Kong people how different Hong Kong was from the mainland.  +
Between 1978 and 1987, Hong Kong residents made more than 30 million trips to Guangdong.  +
Whereas in the past traveling to China meant a long train ride, by the 1980s Hong Kong people could take hydrofoils, direct buses, and airplanes into Guangdong.  +
By 1987, more than 170,000 PRC residents had visited Hong Kong, mainly to see relatives there.  +
Although the new contacts with China made some Hong Kong people feel that they were part of China, they also made many feel that they were a special, even different, kind of Chinese.  +
People came to realize that they could be culturally Chinese without accepting the PRC regime.  +
A 1985 survey showed that three-fifths of Hong Kong’s Chinese population preferred to see themselves as Hong Kongese rather than Chinese.  +
In the 1980s, local academics started to write about Hong Kong’s historical contributions to modern China.
20世纪70年代末80年代初，随着中国对外开放程度的提高，香港人前往中国大陆的旅行让他们意识到香港与大陆的差异。1978年至1987年间，香港居民前往广东的次数超过3000万次。过去前往中国大陆需要乘坐长途火车，而到了80年代，香港人可以乘坐水翼船、直达巴士和飞机前往广东。到1987年，已有超过17万中国大陆居民到访香港，主要目的是探亲访友。虽然与中国大陆的新接触让一些香港人感到自己是中国的一部分，但也让许多人觉得自己是特殊的、甚至是与众不同的中国人。人们逐渐意识到，即使不接受中华人民共和国的政权，他们也可以拥有中国文化。1985年的一项调查显示，五分之三的香港华人更愿意将自己视为香港人而非中国人。上世纪80年代，香港本地学者开始撰写有关香港对现代中国历史贡献的文章。 +



This sense of Hong Kong identity could also be seen in the way activist discourse and campaigns shifted from Chinese nationalism to local community affairs.  +
In the early 1970s, the focus of activism was often on Chinese affairs.  +
For example, college students in Hong Kong started to take a greater interest in Chinese politics and to show their pride in China, which after decades of opposition from the United States had finally been admitted to the United Nations (UN).  +
In 1971, students held an unauthorized demonstration in Victoria Park to protest Japan’s refusal to surrender its claims to the Diaoyutai Islands.  +
University student federations organized trips to China in 1971 and 1972 and a series of “China Week” exhibitions in 1973 and were instrumental in the campaign to make Chinese an official language.  +
As Hong Kong’s economy improved and its population became more educated, however, activist groups such as the People’s Council on Public Housing Policy, the Society for Community Organisation, the Christian Industrial Committee, the Hong Kong Professional Teachers’ Union, and the Hong Kong Social Workers General Union demanded more from the government.  +
Thus, in 1976 they organized protests against rent increases in public housing.  +
In 1977 they demanded more participation in public housing policy.  +
In 1980 they organized a protest against increases in bus fares.  +
Many of these groups were organized by the former student activists who had taken such a strong interest in Chinese affairs.
这种香港身份认同感也体现在活动话语和运动的重心从中国民族主义转向本地社区事务上。20世纪70年代初，活动的核心往往是中国事务。例如，香港大学生开始更加关注中国政治，并表达他们对中国的自豪感。在经历了美国数十年的反对后，中国终于加入了联合国。1971年，学生们在维多利亚公园举行了一场未经批准的示威游行，抗议日本拒绝放弃对钓鱼岛的主权声索。大学学生联合会在1971年和1972年组织了赴华访问，并在1973年举办了一系列“中国周”展览，并在争取汉语成为官方语言的运动中发挥了重要作用。然而，随着香港经济的改善和民众受教育程度的提高，诸如公共房屋政策人民委员会、社区组织协会、基督教产业委员会、香港专业教师联合会和香港社会工作者总工会等维权团体开始向政府提出更多诉求。因此，他们在1976年组织了反对公共房屋租金上涨的抗议活动。1977年，他们要求在公共房屋政策方面拥有更大的参与权。1980年，他们组织了反对巴士票价上涨的抗议活动。这些团体大多由曾经积极参与中国事务的学生运动人士组织成立。 +



Developments in communications and transportation also helped people to think of themselves as being from one place, Hong Kong, rather than from Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, or the New Territories.  +
The opening of the first cross-harbor tunnel in 1972 brought Hong Kong Island and Kowloon much closer together, as did the Mass Transit Railway (MTR), begun in 1975 and completed by the late 1980s.  +
Fast, clean, and efficient, the mostly underground MTR meets with the Kowloon-Canton Railway, linking Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories.  +
Until the 1950s, the New Territories had remained very much its own part of Hong Kong.  +
Society revolved mainly around agriculture and markets, which were both commercial sites and social gatherings.  +
There were few schools or medical facilities.  +
By the end of the 1960s, however, the pace of life was changing rapidly.  +
The shift in the New Territories during the 1950s from agriculture to industry coincided with Britain’s postwar economic regeneration.  +
Because until 1962 anyone born in the British Commonwealth could settle in Britain, New Territories residents began a pattern of chain migration to Britain, leading to the rise of Chinese restaurants and Hong Kong Chinese communities there and stimulating the New Territories economy through money remitted by these emigrants.  +
After the government decided in 1972 to develop the New Territories to relieve overcrowding in Hong Kong and Kowloon, the “new town” projects helped change the character of the New Territories by bringing in residents from other parts of the colony and blurring the line between rural and urban.
通讯和交通的发展也使人们逐渐认同自己来自同一个地方——香港，而不是香港岛、九龙或新界。1972年第一条海底隧道的开通，以及1975年开始建设、20世纪80年代末竣工的港铁，都极大地拉近了香港岛和九龙之间的距离。快速、清洁、高效的港铁线路大多位于地下，并与九广铁路相连，连接香港、九龙和新界。直到20世纪50年代，新界仍然是香港一个相对独立的区域。当时的社会主要围绕农业和市场展开，市场既是商业场所，也是社交聚会的场所。学校和医疗设施很少。然而，到了20世纪60年代末，生活节奏发生了快速变化。20世纪50年代新界从农业向工业的转型，恰逢英国战后经济复苏。由于1962年之前，任何出生于英联邦国家的人都可以在英国定居，新界居民开始形成一种连锁移民模式，将香港华人带到英国，这带动了英国华人餐馆和华人社区的兴起，并通过这些移民的汇款刺激了新界的经济发展。1972年，政府决定开发新界以缓解香港和九龙的人口拥挤问题，“新市镇”项目通过引入殖民地其他地区的居民，模糊了城乡界限，从而改变了新界的面貌。 +



From a colonial perspective, Hong Kong had also become its own place with its own administrative identity, enjoying a wide degree of political and economic autonomy.  +
After the budget surplus of the 1947–1948 fiscal year, Britain surrendered its tight budgetary supervision over Hong Kong.  +
By the early 1950s, the British government had given Hong Kong a considerable level of administrative and financial autonomy.  +
After the British government stopped reviewing Hong Kong’s annual budget in the late 1950s during the tenure of Governor Robert Black, the colony became free to set its own tax policies and forge its own housing and social welfare programs.  +
In the 1960s and 1970s the colonial administration won the right to set its own commercial policies and exchange rate and to handle its own foreign reserves.  +
While this autonomy frequently enabled the colonial government to evade the British government’s orders and guidelines for decolonization and political reform, it enabled Hong Kong to function as its own administrative and economic entity.  +
The colony participated independently in a variety of international organizations and maintained trade development offices in all major cities.  +
(The British government retained the right, however, to overrule in matters such as capital punishment, as it did in 1973 when Murray MacLehose refused to pardon an offender sentenced to death.  +
Hong Kong’s last execution occurred in 1966, although capital punishment remained on the books until 1991.) The British government had historically shown little interest in Hong Kong, and as Britain’s diplomatic and economic relations with China took precedence over its concerns about Hong Kong, colonial officials and British businessmen found themselves increasingly both isolated from the British government and defensive about Hong Kong’s status.
从殖民视角来看，香港也逐渐成为一个拥有独立行政身份的独立地区，享有高度的政治和经济自治权。1947-1948财政年度财政盈余后，英国放弃了对香港严格的预算监管。到20世纪50年代初，英国政府已给予香港相当大的行政和财政自主权。20世纪50年代末，在罗伯特·布莱克担任总督期间，英国政府停止审查香港的年度预算，此后，香港得以自由制定税收政策，并建立自己的住房和社会福利体系。20世纪60年代和70年代，殖民地政府获得了制定商业政策和汇率以及管理外汇储备的权利。虽然这种自治权常常使殖民地政府得以规避英国政府关于非殖民化和政治改革的命令和指导方针，但也使香港得以作为一个独立的行政和经济实体运作。香港殖民地独立参与了多个国际组织，并在所有主要城市设有贸易发展办事处。（然而，英国政府保留了在死刑等问题上否决香港决定的权力，例如1973年麦理浩拒绝赦免一名被判处死刑的罪犯。香港最后一次执行死刑是在1966年，但死刑制度一直保留到1991年。）英国政府历来对香港漠不关心，随着英国与中国的外交和经济关系优先于对香港的关注，殖民地官员和英国商人发现自己越来越被英国政府孤立，并且越来越在意香港的地位。 +



IDENTITY THROUGH CREDIBILITY: THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION
通过信誉建立身份：反腐败斗争
As it had in earlier decades, the colonial government played an important role in shaping this sense of Hong Kong identity.  +
In the 1970s, for example, the government responded to the increased interest in Chinese affairs by trying to cultivate a Hong Kong identity through such events as the Hong Kong Festival and the Keep Hong Kong Clean Campaign and by encouraging consumerism as a contrast to the Socialism in China.  +
This local identity was reinforced by the government’s toughened policies toward Chinese illegal immigrants, often smuggled into Hong Kong by boat owners known as snake heads.  +
In October 1980, Governor MacLehose announced that the government’s “touch base” policy would be ended.  +
Whereas since 1950 the government had allowed illegal immigrants who had joined their families or found gainful employment to stay in Hong Kong, captured illegal immigrants would now be repatriated.  +
The old policy, the governor explained, had become a “tragic charade” in which the illegal immigrants had “little to lose and everything to gain by running the gauntlet of Chinese and Hong Kong forces.” Reflecting popular local sentiments, MacLehose argued that these illegal immigrants strained housing, medical facilities, education, and social welfare and were responsible for crime “out of all proportion to their numbers.”2 These crackdowns on illegal immigrants clearly distinguished Hong Kong Chinese, reminding them that they had special rights and privileges unavailable to Chinese on the mainland.
如同过去几十年一样，殖民政府在塑造香港的身份认同方面发挥了重要作用。例如，在 20 世纪 70 年代，为了回应民众对中国事务日益增长的关注，政府试图通过举办香港节和“保持香港清洁运动”等活动来培育香港身份认同，并鼓励消费主义，以此与中国大陆的社会主义形成对比。政府对非法移民采取的强硬政策进一步强化了这种本土身份认同，这些非法移民通常由被称为“蛇头”的船主偷渡到香港。1980 年 10 月，麦理浩总督宣布政府将终止“接触式”政策。自 1950 年以来，政府允许与家人团聚或找到稳定工作的非法移民留在香港，而现在，被捕的非法移民将被遣返。总督解释说，旧政策已经变成了一场“悲剧性的闹剧”，非法移民“几乎没有什么可失去的，却能通过游走在中国和香港两方势力之间的危险境地而获益”。麦理浩反映了当地民众的普遍看法，他认为这些非法移民给住房、医疗设施、教育和社会福利带来了巨大压力，而且他们犯下的罪行“与其人数不成比例”。 2 这些针对非法移民的打击行动明显区别于其他香港人，提醒他们享有中国大陆人所不享有的特殊权利和特权。 +



The colonial government’s efforts to create a local identity could not have succeeded had it not achieved a remarkable level of political credibility by tackling one of Hong Kong’s most serious problems: corruption.  +
More than any of his other reforms, Governor MacLehose is best known for his fight against government corruption.  +
According to Elsie Tu, who spent decades uncovering government corruption and other abuses, MacLehose “would not close his eyes to corruption as his predecessors had.” Having tried for so long to show how corruption was “making a mockery of the rule of law” but succeeding in gaining “only trouble” for herself, Tu concludes that “without Governor MacLehose it is certain that corruption would have continued, because the law enforcement body, the police, were themselves corrupt, making it impossible to take legal action against that heinous crime that was destroying our community.”3 Leo Goodstadt, who has spent many years working in Hong Kong and writing about the region, is less impressed by MacLehose’s efforts to end corruption.  +
According to Goodstadt, the governor refused to listen to senior police officers who tried to complain about police corruption because he “did not want integrity to become a public issue for fear of tarnishing the new, positive image he was anxious to create for the colonial administration.”4
若非殖民政府通过解决香港最严重的弊端之一——贪污——而赢得非凡的政治公信力，其塑造本土认同的努力便不可能成功。麦理浩总督最广为人知的改革莫过于其反贪污的举措。据艾尔西·杜（Elsie Tu）所述，麦理浩“不像他的前任那样对贪污视而不见”。杜曾花费数十年揭露政府贪污和其他滥用职权的行为，她认为麦理浩“不会像他的前任那样对贪污视而不见”。杜曾长期试图揭露贪污如何“践踏法治”，却“给自己招致了麻烦”。她总结道：“如果没有麦理浩总督，贪污肯定会继续蔓延，因为执法机构——警察——本身就腐败不堪，根本无法对这种摧毁我们社区的滔天罪行采取法律行动。” ³ 长期在香港工作并撰写有关香港文章的利奥·古斯塔特（Leo Goodstadt）对麦理浩根除贪污的努力却不以为然。据古德斯塔特称，总督拒绝听取高级警官们对警察腐败的投诉，因为他“不希望廉洁问题成为公众关注的焦点，以免损害他急于为殖民政府打造的全新正面形象。” 4 +
Despite their differing attitudes toward MacLehose, these two veterans of Hong Kong’s political scene help us understand why corruption was such a problem in Hong Kong and why controlling it ultimately became such a test of the government’s credibility.  +
Colonial officials often blamed the prevalence of corruption on the Chinese community, insisting that corruption was so deeply ingrained in Chinese culture that it could never be curbed, let alone eradicated, and that “the British themselves were largely untainted.”5 But the number of expatriates later convicted of corruption once the government finally tried to tackle the problem proves that there was nothing particularly Chinese about corruption.  +
For Tu, the root of the evil lay in the lack of representation in the legislature, which created “many opportunities for corruption and malpractice in the civil service.”6 Similarly, Goodstadt blames the problem on the “uneasy partnership” between the colonial government and the local British and Chinese business elite, which “created an environment in which the dishonest and the venal found it easy to flourish in both the public and private sectors.”7
尽管他们对麦理浩的态度不尽相同，但这两位香港政坛老将却帮助我们理解了为何腐败在香港如此猖獗，以及为何控制腐败最终成为检验政府公信力的关键。殖民官员常常将腐败的盛行归咎于华人社群，坚称腐败根深蒂固于中国文化，根本无法遏制，更遑论根除，并声称“英国人自身基本上清白无辜” 。⁵ 但政府最终着手解决腐败问题后，大量外籍人士因腐败被定罪，这证明腐败并非华人独有。在杜先生看来，腐败的根源在于立法机构中缺乏代表权，这为“公务员队伍中的腐败和渎职提供了诸多机会”。⁶ 同样 ，古斯塔特也把腐败问题归咎于殖民政府与当地英籍和华籍商业精英之间“不稳定的合作关系”，这种关系“营造了一种环境，使得不诚实和贪婪之徒在公共和私营部门都能轻易地从中牟利”。 7 +
It is somewhat difficult to blame the prevalence of corruption entirely on colonialism and the lack of political representation, for democratic governments can also be corrupt.  +
Regardless, corruption had been a way of life since the founding of colonial Hong Kong but became especially prevalent and highly institutionalized after World War II.  +
Still, most colonial authorities assumed that it was confined mainly to low-ranking Chinese officials and police officers.  +
Despite evidence of extensive corruption in the mid-1950s that led to the formation of the Advisory Committee on Corruption in 1958, Goodstadt argues that Governor Grantham’s measures to tackle the problem were “feeble” and “merely token measures.”8 Corruption became a serious political issue after the Star Ferry riots of 1966.  +
Although the colonial government downplayed the situation in the official published report, senior officials privately were more concerned and sent a mission to Singapore to study how that former British colony had cracked down on corruption.  +
But even though the 1966 riots had raised concerns about corruption in the police force and other parts of government, the police force’s performance in the 1967 disturbances improved its reputation “dramatically” and made the Hong Kong public ready to “overlook conduct that would have been unacceptable in less troubled times.”9
将腐败盛行完全归咎于殖民主义和政治代表性的缺失有些困难，因为民主政府也可能存在腐败。无论如何，自香港殖民地建立以来，腐败就一直存在，但在二战后变得尤为普遍且高度制度化。然而，大多数殖民当局仍然认为腐败主要局限于低级中国官员和警察。尽管 20 世纪 50 年代中期已出现大量腐败证据，并于 1958 年成立了贪污咨询委员会，但古德斯塔特认为，格兰瑟姆总督为解决这一问题所采取的措施“软弱无力”，“仅仅是象征性的”。1966 年天星小轮骚乱后，腐败成为一个严重的政治问题。尽管殖民政府在官方发布的报告中淡化了这一情况， 但高级官员私下里却更为担忧，并派遣代表团前往新加坡考察这个前英国殖民地是如何打击腐败的。尽管 1966 年的暴乱引发了人们对警队和政府其他部门腐败的担忧，但警队在 1967 年骚乱中的表现“显著”改善了其声誉，并使香港公众愿意“对在局势不那么动荡的时期是不可接受的行为予以宽容” 。9 +
By the early 1970s, corruption permeated the Hong Kong government, from senior officials down to police officers who were deeply involved in syndicated corruption and firemen who refused to turn on their hoses until they received their “water money.” But even when the “general public was bitterly resentful about the endless extortion it experienced in its daily contacts with government departments,” writes Goodstadt, colonial officials “dismissed its complaints as malicious or exaggerated.”10 The case of Peter Godber, however, embarrassed the government in such a way that MacLehose could no longer ignore the problem.  +
In April 1973, the commissioner of police learned that Godber, a chief superintendent of police who had been decorated for his courage in the 1967 riots and had been promoted to second-in-command of the Kowloon police in 1971, was sending large sums of money outside of Hong Kong.  +
An investigation by the Anti-Corruption Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department revealed that Godber’s resources were six times his salary from the previous twenty years.  +
But Godber was able to use his government connections to evade security checks at the airport and escape, first to Singapore and then to Britain, where he knew he could not be extradited to Hong Kong.  +
The scandal was widely publicized in the local and British media.  +
Local activists quickly organized a “Fight Corruption, Catch Godber” campaign, which further humiliated the government by holding large public demonstrations against corruption.
到了 20 世纪 70 年代初，腐败已渗透到香港政府的各个角落，从高级官员到深度参与集团贪污的警员，再到拒绝开水枪直到拿到“水费”的消防员，无一幸免。古德斯塔特写道，即便“公众对日常与政府部门接触中不断遭受的敲诈勒索深感愤慨”，殖民官员也“将他们的抱怨斥为恶意或夸大其词”。 10 然而，彼得·戈德伯的案件令政府颜面尽失，以至于麦理浩再也无法忽视这个问题。1973 年 4 月，警务处处长得知，戈德伯——这位曾因在 1967 年骚乱中英勇表现而获得嘉奖、并于 1971 年晋升为九龙警局副局长的警司——正在向香港境外转移大量资金。刑事调查局反贪污科的调查显示，戈德伯的财产相当于他过去二十年薪水的六倍。但他利用其政府关系，躲过了机场安检，先逃往新加坡，后又逃往英国，因为他知道在英国他不会被引渡回香港。这起丑闻在香港本地和英国媒体上广泛曝光。香港的维权人士迅速组织了一场“反贪污，抓捕戈德伯”的运动，通过举行大规模的反贪示威游行，进一步羞辱了政府。 +



After Godber’s highly publicized escape, MacLehose appointed High Court judge Alistair Blair-Kerr to run an inquiry.  +
Blair-Kerr’s report “portrayed a deeply-corrupt police force and a government riddled with dishonesty in almost every department.”11 In 1974, MacLehose established the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) led by Jack Cater, who had first come to Hong Kong right after World War II in the interim military administration and then returned in 1967 as defense secretary, and John Prendergast, an intelligence officer who had previously served in Palestine, the Gold Coast, Egypt, Kenya, Cyprus, and Aden.  +
Cater ”launched a campaign against corruption of almost evangelical fervour.“12 Although the commission was initially greeted with cynicism, its success in extraditing Godber in 1975 showed that it meant business.  +
Godber, notes Tu, ”had given the game away, served a prison term, and unintentionally set the wheels of justice against corruption in motion.“13
在戈德伯越狱事件轰动一时之后，麦理浩任命高等法院法官阿利斯泰尔·布莱尔-克尔负责调查。布莱尔-克尔的报告“揭露了警队腐败不堪，政府几乎每个部门都充斥着不诚实的行为。” 11 1974 年，麦理浩成立了廉政公署（ICAC），由杰克·卡特领导。卡特二战结束后不久便来到香港，在临时军事行政当局任职，后于 1967 年以国防大臣的身份重返香港。另一位成员是约翰·普伦德加斯特，他曾是一名情报官员，先后在巴勒斯坦、黄金海岸、埃及、肯尼亚、塞浦路斯和亚丁等地工作。卡特“发起了一场近乎狂热的反腐运动。” 12 尽管廉政公署最初受到质疑，但其在 1975 年成功引渡戈德伯表明，廉政公署是认真的。涂指出，戈德伯“泄露了秘密，锒铛入狱，却无意中启动了反腐败的司法程序。” 13 +
The ICAC now faced another problem.  +
So many police officers were arrested that police morale plummeted, and lower-ranking officers complained that the ICAC was using convicted policemen and other criminals to obtain evidence.  +
In October 1977, several thousand police officers marched on the police commissioner’s office.  +
Some of the protesting officers then marched on the ICAC headquarters, breaking into the building and injuring several ICAC officers.  +
Fearing that the police might go on strike and plunge the colony into anarchy, on November 5 MacLehose issued a partial amnesty for corruption committed before January 1, 1977, except for extremely grave cases.  +
Although many people were shocked and dismayed that the governor would yield, there would have been no way to replace Hong Kong’s large police force on such short notice without calling in the military.  +
As MacLehose later recalled, “it would have been feasible to go on prosecuting people for offences committed long ago, but the risk of such prosecutions had resulted in an alliance between the formerly corrupt and the presently corrupt which was the heart of the near mutiny of the police.  +
The amnesty split off these two rather different elements and simplified the ICAC’s ability to press on with the prosecution of current corruption.”14
廉政公署此时面临另一个问题。大量警员被捕，导致警队士气低落，低级警员抱怨廉政公署利用已定罪的警员和其他罪犯来获取证据。1977 年 10 月，数千名警员游行至警务处处长办公室。部分抗议警员随后游行至廉政公署总部，闯入大楼并致数名廉政公署人员受伤。麦理浩担心警员可能罢工，使香港陷入无政府状态，于 11 月 5 日颁布了一项部分特赦令，赦免 1977 年 1 月 1 日之前犯下的贪污罪行，但极其严重的案件除外。尽管许多人对总督的妥协感到震惊和失望，但在如此短的时间内，如果不动用军队，根本无法替代香港庞大的警力。正如麦克莱霍斯后来回忆的那样，“继续起诉那些很久以前犯下的罪行是可行的，但这种起诉的风险导致了曾经腐败的人和现在腐败的人结成联盟，而这正是警察几乎发生兵变的根源。大赦将这两个截然不同的群体分开，简化了廉政公署继续起诉当前腐败行为的能力。” 14 +
The 1977 crisis carved a deep rift between the police and the ICAC that would not be bridged until the mid-1980s.  +
The ICAC also lost a considerable degree of face, although it was eventually able to regain public confidence.  +
Other problems remained unresolved.  +
For example, the ICAC often seemed less willing to prosecute British civil servants.  +
It also lacked control over triad gangs, who often served as middlemen for corrupt civil servants, especially among the police force.  +
As Goodstadt argues, “criminal proceedings against police officers and the more flamboyant nature of police corruption distracted public attention from the far more lucrative and better-organized conspiracies in the business world.” Corruption was especially rife in the property and construction businesses.  +
With fire and safety restrictions to be avoided, “scandals in the property sector and the construction industry plagued the rest of British rule and continued under the post-colonial administration.” And although the ICAC exposed “a small number of senior officials and some minor business and professional persons,” some government officials “continued to maintain close social connections with business and professional circles they were supposed to oversee, unintimidated by the ICAC’s public criticisms of such behaviour.”15
1977 年的危机在警方和廉政公署之间造成了深刻的裂痕，直到 20 世纪 80 年代中期才得以弥合。廉政公署也因此颜面尽失，尽管最终得以重获公众信任。其他问题依然悬而未决。例如，廉政公署似乎不太愿意起诉英国公务员。它也缺乏对三合会的控制，这些团伙经常充当腐败公务员（尤其是警队中的腐败分子）的中间人。正如古德斯塔特所言，“针对警官的刑事诉讼以及警察腐败更为张扬的性质，分散了公众对商业界利润更高、组织更严密的阴谋的注意力。” 房地产和建筑行业的腐败尤为猖獗。由于消防和安全限制措施的规避，“房地产和建筑行业的丑闻困扰着英国统治下的其他地区，并在后殖民时代的政府统治下继续蔓延。”尽管廉政公署曝光了“少数高级官员和一些规模较小的商界及专业人士”，但一些政府官员“仍然与他们本应监管的商界和专业人士保持密切的社交联系，丝毫不惧廉政公署对此类行为的公开批评”。 15 +
Given Hong Kong’s deep-rooted and widespread corruption, however, the establishment of the ICAC and the fight against corruption in the 1970s was a remarkable feat.  +
“Almost overnight,” writes Goodstadt, “the principle of honest administration had become part of the civil service culture.  +
The community now looked to a professional organization ...  +
to police the colonial administration and enforce zero tolerance of corruption.” The establishment of the ICAC did more than help the government tackle corruption.  +
As Goodstadt argues, it “generated invaluable political dividends for British rule.” The Hong Kong public “became convinced almost at once that, at last, the British had established an agency to which it could complain, fearlessly and effectively, about abuse of office, dereliction of duty, and the unlawful exactions of officialdom.  +
At a stroke, the ICAC encountered deep-rooted cynicism about the colonial administration and its sense of duty towards the population at large.  +
In a colonial and non-democratic political environment, that change of image was an invaluable source of credibility.”16
然而，鉴于香港根深蒂固且普遍存在的腐败问题，廉政公署的成立以及 20 世纪 70 年代的反腐斗争堪称一项非凡的成就。古德斯塔特写道：“几乎一夜之间，廉洁奉公的原则就融入了公务员文化。社会各界开始寄希望于一个专业的机构……来监督殖民政府，并对腐败采取零容忍态度。”廉政公署的成立不仅帮助政府打击腐败，正如古德斯塔特所言，它“为英国统治带来了宝贵的政治红利”。香港公众“几乎立刻确信，英国终于建立了一个机构，让他们可以无所畏惧、有效地投诉滥用职权、玩忽职守以及官员的非法勒索。廉政公署一举打破了公众对殖民政府及其对广大民众的责任感的根深蒂固的怀疑。在殖民主义和非民主的政治环境下，这种形象的转变是建立公信力的宝贵来源。” 16 +
NEGOTIATING HONG KONG’S FUTURE
谈判香港的未来
Looming over the changes and developments in the 1970s was the question of Hong Kong’s future political status.  +
Since coming to power in 1949, the Chinese government had generally left Hong Kong alone, rarely even discussing its political status.  +
Hong Kong had played an important role in the Chinese economy in the 1960s and 1970s.  +
After the disastrous Great Leap Forward and through the Cultural Revolution, foreign currency acquired through colonial Hong Kong financed much of the PRC’s imports.  +
In the 1960s, the PRC earned almost half of its hard currency from selling food and water to Hong Kong.  +
Journalist Richard Hughes described Hong Kong as “China’s only rewarding bridgehead with the rest of the world and China’s most convenient springboard for export dumping forays into South East Asia.” Through Hong Kong, the PRC was flooding markets with bicycles, canned goods, clothing, radios, and sewing machines that cost half as much as their Japanese equivalents.  +
In Hong Kong, the PRC government ran more than fifty department stores, the Bank of China and eight smaller banks, two insurance companies, three financial syndicates, and “a Maoist flush of shoe stores, publishing houses and restaurants.”17 Whereas Hong Kong was better known as a British and American listening post on China, it served a similar function for Chinese Communist Party cadres and activists, who used the colony to stay in touch with the outside world.  +
Not surprisingly, PRC leaders realized Hong Kong’s economic and political value and were eager to continue the pragmatic relationship with the colonial administration that had been built in the 1950s.
笼罩在 20 世纪 70 年代各种变革和发展之上的，是香港未来政治地位的问题。自 1949 年执政以来，中国政府通常对香港不加干涉，甚至很少讨论其政治地位。在 20 世纪 60 年代和 70 年代，香港在中国经济中扮演着重要角色。在灾难性的大跃进之后，以及文化大革命期间，通过殖民地时期的香港获得的外汇为中华人民共和国的大部分进口提供了资金。在 20 世纪 60 年代，中华人民共和国近一半的外汇收入来自向香港出售食品和水。记者理查德·休斯将香港描述为“中国与世界其他地区之间唯一有利可图的桥头堡，也是中国向东南亚倾销商品的最便捷跳板”。通过香港，中华人民共和国向市场倾销自行车、罐头食品、服装、收音机和缝纫机，这些商品的价格仅为日本同类产品的一半。在香港，中国政府运营着五十多家百货公司、中国银行和八家小型银行、两家保险公司、三家金融集团，以及“毛泽东时代涌现的鞋店、出版社和餐馆”。 17 尽管香港更为人所知的是英美两国监听中国动向的据点，但它对中国共产党干部和积极分子也发挥着类似的作用，他们利用这片殖民地与外界保持联系。不出所料，中国政府领导人意识到了香港的经济和政治价值，并渴望延续上世纪五十年代与殖民地政府建立的务实关系。 +



After the PRC was finally admitted to the UN in November 1971, however, in March 1972 Huang Hua, China’s ambassador to the UN, clarified Hong Kong’s political status as “a Chinese territory under British administration” and asked that Hong Kong and Macau be removed from the UN’s list of colonial territories.  +
Huang insisted that Hong Kong was an internal Chinese matter, to be solved by the Chinese government “in an appropriate way when conditions are ripe.” When on November 2, 1972, the UN General Assembly removed Hong Kong and Macau from its list of colonial territories, Britain, which had not objected to Huang’s declaration, ended its practice of sending annual reports on Hong Kong to the UN secretary-general.  +
In a language shift designed to reflect this change and to suit both the British and the Chinese governments, Hong Kong changed from a Crown Colony to a Dependent Territory (although the word “Colony” remained on banknotes until 1985), while the colonial secretary became the chief secretary.  +
As a gesture of goodwill to the PRC government, in 1973 the British government persuaded the Hong Kong government to release the last of the prisoners from the 1967 riots.
然而，在中华人民共和国于1971年11月最终加入联合国之后，1972年3月，中国常驻联合国代表黄华澄清了香港的政治地位，称其为“受英国管辖的中国领土”，并要求将香港和澳门从联合国殖民地名单中移除。黄华坚持认为，香港是中国内政，应由中国政府“在条件成熟时以适当方式”解决。1972年11月2日，联合国大会将香港和澳门从殖民地名单中移除。此前并未反对黄华声明的英国，停止了向联合国秘书长提交香港年度报告的做法。为了反映这一变化并兼顾英中两国政府的利益，香港的官方称谓也随之改变，从“英国直辖殖民地”改为“属地”（尽管“殖民地”一词在纸币上一直保留到1985年），而“殖民地大臣”则改为“行政秘书”。为了向中华人民共和国政府表达善意，英国政府于 1973 年说服香港政府释放了 1967 年骚乱中最后一批囚犯。 +



Not only had Huang Hua insisted that Hong Kong’s future political status would be determined by China rather than Britain, he had also implied that the people of Hong Kong would not have a role in this process.  +
But many people in Hong Kong took Huang’s declaration as little more than official rhetoric, assuming that the PRC would continue its traditional practice of leaving Hong Kong alone.  +
The economic boom of the 1970s led some people in Hong Kong to hope that China would simply let Hong Kong be, especially since it had so much to gain from the colony’s continued economic prosperity.  +
And when the PRC government turned down Portugal’s offer in 1974 to return Macau, many people in Hong Kong took this as a sign of hope that China might be willing to do the same for Hong Kong.  +
When Queen Elizabeth visited Hong Kong in May 1975 as the first reigning British sovereign to do so, she was welcomed by thousands of well-wishers.  +
In September 1978, a senior official at the Hong Kong branch of the New China News Agency admitted that the 1967 riots were a mistake and that China should learn from Hong Kong and from other industrializing countries.
黄华不仅坚持香港未来的政治地位将由中国而非英国决定，他还暗示香港人民不会参与这一进程。但许多香港人认为黄华的声明不过是官方的说辞，想当然地认为中华人民共和国会继续奉行不干涉香港的传统做法。20世纪70年代的经济繁荣让一些香港人希望中国会放任香港，尤其是在中国能从香港持续的经济繁荣中获益良多的情况下。1974年，当中国政府拒绝葡萄牙归还澳门的提议时，许多香港人将其视为中国或许也愿意对香港采取同样做法的希望之光。1975年5月，伊丽莎白女王访问香港，成为首位访问香港的英国在位君主，受到了数千名民众的热烈欢迎。 1978 年 9 月，新华社香港分社的一位高级官员承认，1967 年的骚乱是一个错误，中国应该向香港和其他工业化国家吸取教训。 +



Some Hong Kong investors, however, grew concerned about taking out new leases since the government could not grant any leases beyond the 1997 deadline.  +
In 1976, Jimmy McGregor, director of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, warned that investors would need assurances from the PRC government before making long-term investments in Hong Kong.  +
When in March 1979 the PRC government invited MacLehose to Beijing on an official visit, the governor saw the first official visit to the PRC by a sitting governor as a chance to discuss the expiration of the New Territories lease.  +
In his meeting with new Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, MacLehose suggested that the Legislative Council unilaterally set aside the 1997 deadline without making any permanent claims to the territory.  +
Although Deng rejected this suggestion, MacLehose returned to Hong Kong relieved and optimistic.  +
Choosing his words carefully, he explained to the Hong Kong public that while Deng had maintained that China would eventually resolve the Hong Kong issue, he had also assured the governor that Hong Kong investors could “set their hearts at ease.” MacLehose did not tell the Hong Kong public that Deng had rejected the proposal to set aside the 1997 deadline.
然而，一些香港投资者开始担忧签订新的租约，因为政府无法在1997年期限之后再授予任何租约。1976年，香港总商会理事长吉米·麦格雷戈警告说，投资者在香港进行长期投资之前，需要中国政府的保证。1979年3月，中国政府邀请麦理浩对北京进行正式访问。麦理浩认为，这是在任香港总督首次正式访问中国，也是讨论新界租约到期问题的良机。在与新任中国领导人邓小平的会晤中，麦理浩建议立法会单方面搁置1997年的租约期限，而不对香港提出任何永久性主张。尽管邓小平拒绝了这一建议，但麦理浩返回香港时仍感到如释重负，充满希望。他斟酌着措辞，向香港公众解释说，邓小平虽然坚持中国最终会解决香港问题，但也向港督保证香港投资者可以“放心”。麦理浩没有告诉香港公众，邓小平拒绝了搁置1997年最后期限的提议。 +



No one knows exactly when the PRC government decided that it would retake Hong Kong.  +
Journalist Kevin Rafferty believes that Deng told MacLehose during his trip to Beijing that China would recover Hong Kong in 1997.  +
Rafferty notes that the passing of the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act of 1981, which demoted more than 2.5 million Hong Kong Chinese entitled to carry British passports to “British Dependent Territory citizens” and excluded them from right of abode in Britain, implies that the British government knew that 1997 would see the end of British Hong Kong.18 Although the unofficial members of the Legislative and Executive Councils had wanted to send a delegation to London to lobby the British Parliament against voting for the bill, MacLehose told them to cancel the trip.  +
(The unofficial members may well have succeeded, for the bill passed by only three votes.)
没有人确切知道中华人民共和国政府何时决定收回香港。记者凯文·拉弗蒂认为，邓小平在麦理浩访问北京期间曾告诉他，中国将在 1997 年收回香港。拉弗蒂指出，1981 年《英国国籍（香港）法》的通过，将超过 250 万有权持有英国护照的香港公民降级为“英国属地公民”，并剥夺了他们在英国的居留权，这表明英国政府当时就知道 1997 年将是英国统治香港的终结。 18 尽管立法会和行政会的非正式成员曾希望派遣代表团前往伦敦游说英国议会反对该法案，但麦理浩让他们取消了行程。（非正式成员的努力很可能奏效，因为该法案最终仅以三票之差获得通过。） +
In any case, MacLehose’s visit to Beijing created a temporary sense of relief in Hong Kong.  +
The stock market and property markets rose, and foreign banks and businesses poured into Hong Kong even while land in Hong Kong became the most expensive in the world.  +
Hong Kong people were impressed by China’s economic modernization and Deng’s policy of opening China to the outside world.  +
This optimism began to wane by 1982.  +
British prime minister Margaret Thatcher was planning a trip to Asia in September that would include China, where she would surely have to broach the subject of Hong Kong.  +
There were other ominous signs.  +
The Chinese National People’s Congress, the PRC’s highest legislative body, had drafted provisions for a Special Administration Region (SAR) the previous year.  +
In January 1982, Chinese premier Zhao Ziyang told British lord privy seal Humphrey Atkins that the PRC had already made provisions for Hong Kong after 1997.  +
In July, senior PRC official Peng Zhen spoke of the reunification of Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan as SARs.  +
Although some scholars believe that Thatcher never actually thought a settlement might be reached for retaining Hong Kong, when the prime minister arrived in Beijing on September 22, fresh from Britain’s victory against Argentina in the Falkland Islands, she at least appeared as if she thought she had a chance to keep Hong Kong because of the treaties ceding Hong Kong and Kowloon.  +
Thatcher insisted that the Sino-British treaties could only be altered, not abrogated, and that Britain had a moral obligation to the people of Hong Kong, but PRC officials declared that the treaties were unequal and had been signed with the long-defunct Qing government.
总之，麦理浩访问北京给香港带来了一丝暂时的喘息之机。股市和房地产市场上涨，外国银行和企业纷纷涌入香港，尽管香港的地价也成为全球最高。香港人对中国的经济现代化和邓小平的对外开放政策印象深刻。然而，这种乐观情绪在 1982 年开始消退。英国首相玛格丽特·撒切尔计划于 9 月访问亚洲，其中就包括中国，届时她必然会谈到香港问题。此外，还有其他不祥之兆。中华人民共和国最高立法机构——全国人民代表大会，在前一年就已起草了设立香港特别行政区（SAR）的条款。1982 年 1 月，中国总理赵紫阳告诉英国掌玺大臣汉弗莱·阿特金斯，中华人民共和国已经为 1997 年后的香港问题做好了安排。同年 7 月，中国高级官员彭真谈到了香港、澳门和台湾以特别行政区形式统一的问题。尽管一些学者认为撒切尔夫人从未真正考虑过能够就保留香港达成协议，但当她于 9 月 22 日抵达北京时，刚刚结束英国在福克兰群岛战胜阿根廷的战役，她至少表面上看起来认为自己有机会保住香港，因为中英两国曾签订过割让香港和九龙的条约。撒切尔夫人坚持认为，中英条约只能修改，不能废除，英国对香港人民负有道义上的责任。但中华人民共和国官员则宣称，这些条约是不平等的，而且是与早已不复存在的清政府签订的。 +



By the time Thatcher left Beijing, it was clear that China would try to recover Hong Kong in 1997.  +
Deng Xiaoping did, however, assure Thatcher that Hong Kong people could rule Hong Kong after China resumed control.  +
Shortly thereafter, prominent Hong Kong people were invited to visit Beijing, where they were welcomed by PRC leaders.  +
Still, public confidence in Hong Kong’s post-1997 future dropped so far that it caused panic in Hong Kong’s financial markets and a collapse in the property market.  +
The sharp decrease in investor confidence led to Hong Kong’s slowest growth in GDP since 1975.  +
In September 1983, the plunging Hong Kong dollar was pegged to the American dollar, which restored some self-assurance.  +
But much of this confidence was undermined in March 1984 when one of the oldest and largest British firms in Hong Kong, Jardine and Matheson, which only one year earlier the PRC government had praised for helping to develop China’s international trade, declared that it would move its legal domicile from Hong Kong to Bermuda in order to protect its ability to function under English law after 1997.
撒切尔夫人离开北京时，中国将在 1997 年试图收回香港的意图已昭然若揭。然而，邓小平向撒切尔夫人保证，中国恢复对香港的控制后，香港人民能够治理香港。此后不久，一些香港知名人士应邀访问北京，受到中国领导人的欢迎。尽管如此，公众对香港 1997 年后的未来信心大幅下降，引发香港金融市场恐慌和房地产市场崩盘。投资者信心的急剧下降导致香港 GDP 增速创下 1975 年以来的最低水平。1983 年 9 月，港元与美元挂钩，这在一定程度上恢复了香港的信心。但这种信心在 1984 年 3 月受到了很大程度的打击。当时，香港历史最悠久、规模最大的英国公司之一怡和集团宣布，为了在 1997 年后继续在英国法律下运营，该公司将把法定住所从香港迁至百慕大。就在一年前，中国政府还曾赞扬怡和集团帮助发展了中国的国际贸易。 +



For China, recovering Hong Kong was a way to end the unequal treaties and to reclaim face and honor.  +
For Deng Xiaoping in particular, who saw Hong Kong as part of a larger reunification that included Taiwan and Macau, it was a way to show Taiwan that the one country, two systems mode!—originally meant to apply to Taiwan rather than Hong Kong—could work.  +
As China’s economy became more open in the late 1980s, it became more plausible to think of Hong Kong as part of China rather than as a source of spiritual pollution.  +
Whereas earlier Chinese leaders had been content to benefit from Hong Kong being under British rule, Deng, who took a deep personal interest and leadership role in the recovery of Hong Kong, now believed that the PRC could have sovereignty over Hong Kong and could benefit from it economically (hence his call for mainland industries to invest in Hong Kong).  +
And the fact that the PRC had tolerated Hong Kong’s colonial status for so long meant that it would inherit a much richer prize in 1997.
对中国而言，收复香港是结束不平等条约、重拾面子和尊严的途径。尤其对邓小平而言，他将香港视为包括台湾和澳门在内的更大统一的一部分，以此向台湾证明“一国两制”模式——最初是针对台湾而非香港——是行之有效的。随着中国经济在20世纪80年代末期更加开放，将香港视为中国的一部分而非精神污染源的观念也变得更加合理。此前的中国领导人满足于香港在英国统治下所享有的利益，而邓小平则对香港的收复倾注了大量心血，并发挥了重要的领导作用。他认为中华人民共和国可以对香港拥有主权，并从中获得经济利益（因此他呼吁内地企业投资香港）。此外，中华人民共和国长期以来容忍香港的殖民地地位，这意味着它在1997年将继承一份更为丰厚的遗产。 +



Could the British have played their cards any differently? The suggestion from some quarters in Britain to return the New Territories but retain Hong Kong Island and Kowloon would have neither worked nor satisfied the Chinese government.  +
The British might have argued that by international law the 1842 and 1860 treaties were still valid.  +
But by now Britain, which had long ceased to be an imperial power, was neither interested in nor capable of defending Hong Kong from China, where it had larger diplomatic and commercial interests to pursue.  +
By the early 1960s, British investment in Hong Kong had dropped to less than half of what it had been in the early 1930s.  +
In 1967 the British Treasury concluded that Hong Kong was no longer an economic asset for Britain.  +
Nor could Britain have resisted China militarily.  +
British planners had realized by the late 1950s that Hong Kong could not be defended from an attack by China.  +
The Naval Dockyard was closed down in 1958, and shortly afterward the local garrison was pared down to the minimum needed for internal security.  +
In 1968 the British government announced that it would withdraw all British troops east of Suez by the end of 1971.  +
In the same year, the Colonial Office became part of the Commonwealth Office, which in 1971 was subsumed by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.  +
From then on, British strategy was simply to hold off for as long as possible any PRC attempts to recover Hong Kong.
英国人还能采取其他策略吗？英国国内一些人提出的归还新界但保留香港岛和九龙的建议，既行不通，也无法让中国政府满意。英国或许会辩称，根据国际法，1842年和1860年的条约仍然有效。但此时的英国早已不再是帝国主义强国，既无力也无意保卫香港免受中国的侵略，因为它在中国有更大的外交和商业利益需要追求。到20世纪60年代初，英国在香港的投资已降至20世纪30年代初的一半以下。1967年，英国财政部得出结论，香港已不再是英国的经济资产。英国也无力在军事上抵抗中国。早在20世纪50年代末，英国的决策者们就已意识到，香港无法抵御中国的进攻。海军船坞于1958年关闭，此后不久，驻港部队也被精简至维持内部安全所需的最低限度。1968年，英国政府宣布将于1971年底前撤出苏伊士运河以东的所有英军。同年，殖民地事务部并入联邦事务部，后者于1971年被外交及联邦事务部合并。此后，英国的战略便是尽可能长时间地阻止中华人民共和国收回香港的任何企图。 +



THE SINO-BRITISH NEGOTIATIONS AND THE JOINT DECLARATION
中英谈判与联合声明
MacLehose’s successor, Edward Youde, arrived in Hong Kong in May 1982 during a period of great anxiety.  +
According to an opinion poll conducted in May and June, the majority of Hong Kong’s population preferred the continuation of British rule, even though the British Nationality Act of 1981 had provoked a sense of betrayal.  +
The British government nevertheless saw in Youde someone who could work out a suitable agreement with the PRC.  +
A career diplomat who had once been ambassador to Beijing and was fluent in Mandarin, Youde had negotiated with the Chinese Communists in 1949 for the release of the HMS Amethyst.
麦理浩的继任者尤德于 1982 年 5 月抵达香港，当时正值香港社会高度焦虑之际。根据 5 月和 6 月进行的民意调查，尽管 1981 年的《英国国籍法》引发了香港民众的背叛感，但大多数香港民众仍然倾向于继续英国统治。然而，英国政府认为尤德能够与中华人民共和国达成合适的协议。尤德是一位资深外交官，曾任英国驻北京大使，精通普通话。1949 年，他曾与中国共产党就释放“ 紫水晶号”军舰一事进行谈判。 +



The Sino-British negotiations on Hong Kong’s future took two years.  +
The first round of negotiations, from October 1982 to June 1983, were conducted mainly between the British ambassador to China, Richard Evans, and the Chinese foreign ministry.  +
The chief bone of contention was China’s demand that the British acknowledge Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong, which Britain refused.  +
Only after Margaret Thatcher conceded that Hong Kong would revert to Chinese sovereignty, on the condition that the people of Hong Kong accept the reversion, did the negotiations move on to the second stage.  +
Another problem was that the two sides had very different views of what the final product would look like.  +
As David Wilson, former political advisor to the Hong Kong government (he had accompanied MacLehose to Bejing in 1979) and member of the British negotiating team, recalled, “We had wanted to write a book—which would have looked rather like the Encyclopaedia Britannica —while the Chinese wanted about two or three sides of A4 paper.”19
中英就香港未来进行的谈判持续了两年。第一轮谈判从 1982 年 10 月到 1983 年 6 月，主要由英国驻华大使理查德·埃文斯和中国外交部进行。双方的主要分歧在于中国要求英国承认中国对香港的主权，而英国拒绝了这一要求。直到玛格丽特·撒切尔同意香港回归中国，但前提是香港人民接受这一回归，谈判才进入第二阶段。另一个问题是，双方对最终结果的设想截然不同。正如香港特区政府前政治顾问、英国谈判团队成员戴维·威尔逊（他曾于 1979 年陪同麦理浩访问北京）回忆的那样：“我们想写一本书——类似于《不列颠百科全书》——而中方只想写两三页 A4 纸。” 19 +
The second phase of negotiations began in July 1983.  +
The Chinese negotiating team was led by Vice Foreign Minister Yao Gang, who was later replaced by Assistant Foreign Minister Zhou Nan.  +
The British side was led by former ambassador to China Percy Cradock, although he was replaced by Ambassador Richard Evans in late 1983.  +
Governor Youde participated in the negotiations, but the Chinese insisted that he be present only as a member of the British delegation; the official PRC line was that the negotiations were solely between Britain and China, which represented the people of Hong Kong.  +
Although public opinion in Hong Kong overwhelmingly opposed a return to Chinese rule (a point that Xu Jiatun, the PRC’s de facto representative in Hong Kong as director of the New China News Agency local branch, realized all too well), Deng Xiaoping believed otherwise.  +
In late 1983, Deng warned that unless the negotiations were completed by October 1 (the PRC’s national day) in 1984, the Chinese would make a unilateral declaration.
第二阶段谈判于 1983 年 7 月开始。中方谈判团队由外交部副部长姚刚率领，后由外交部助理部长周楠接任。英方谈判团队由前驻华大使珀西·克拉多克（Percy Cradock）率领，但于 1983 年底由理查德·埃文斯（Richard Evans）大使接任。尤德总督参与了谈判，但中方坚持他只能作为英国代表团成员出席；中华人民共和国官方的说法是，谈判仅限于英国和中国之间，中国代表香港人民。尽管香港公众舆论普遍反对回归中国（这一点，时任新华社香港分社社长、中华人民共和国在香港的实际代表徐家屯深有体会），但邓小平却不这么认为。1983 年底，邓小平警告说，如果谈判不能在 1984 年 10 月 1 日（中华人民共和国国庆日）前完成，中国将单方面发表声明。 +



The main obstacle to the second phase of negotiations was Britain’s hope to continue administering Hong Kong after 1997, even under Chinese sovereignty.  +
Cradock later claimed that Deng Xiaoping was determined to recover Hong Kong fully, “even if it meant taking it back as a barren rock.”20 As it became clear that the Chinese were insistent on recovering Hong Kong, in late 1983 the British shifted their emphasis to maintaining stability in Hong Kong after the transfer to Chinese sovereignty, and in April 1984 Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe regretfully informed the Legislative Council that it would be unrealistic to continue British rule after 1997.  +
Another obstacle arose when the Chinese suggested appointing a joint commission to manage the transition.  +
Convinced that this arrangement would fail, Governor Youde instead suggested a Sino-British Joint Liaison Group that would be strictly consultative.  +
(This Joint Liaison Group was established in Hong Kong shortly after the end of the negotiations; the British side of the group was led by David Wilson, who would return to Hong Kong as governor in 1987.)
第二阶段谈判的主要障碍在于英国希望在 1997 年后，即便香港主权移交中国，仍继续管理香港。克拉多克后来声称，邓小平决心全面收复香港，“即便这意味着收回香港时，它仍是一片荒芜之地”。 20 随着中国坚持收复香港的立场日益明确，英国在 1983 年末将重点转向在香港主权移交中国后维护香港的稳定。1984 年 4 月，外交大臣豪威遗憾地告知立法会，1997 年后继续由英国统治是不现实的。另一个障碍是，中方提议设立一个联合委员会来管理过渡。尤德总督确信这一安排行不通，因此建议成立一个中英联合联络小组，该小组仅负责协商。 （该联合联络小组在谈判结束后不久在香港成立；小组的英方负责人是戴维·威尔逊，他于 1987 年返回香港担任港督。） +
Signed by Thatcher and Premier Zhao Ziyang on December 19, 1984, and ratified on May 28, 1985, the Sino-British Joint Declaration laid out the main terms of the agreement regarding Hong Kong’s future political status.  +
All of Hong Kong would revert to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997.  +
Britain would administer Hong Kong until then and would help maintain its economic prosperity and social stability; the PRC would cooperate in this process.  +
Hong Kong would become an SAR with a high level of autonomy, except in defense and foreign affairs.  +
Hong Kong’s social and economic systems would remain unchanged, as would most of its current laws.  +
The Hong Kong government would retain control over trade policies and trading agreements.  +
Hong Kong would remain a free port, with no taxes paid to China.  +
The rights and freedoms of speech, assembly, and religion would be preserved.  +
Troops of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army troops stationed in Hong Kong would not interfere in internal SAR affairs.  +
This one country, two systems arrangement—which Thatcher described as “an ingenious idea” and Deng Xiaoping called “a product of dialectical Marxism and historical materialism”—would last for fifty years after 1997.
1984年12月19日，撒切尔夫人和赵紫阳总理签署了《中英联合声明》，该声明于1985年5月28日获得批准。声明阐述了有关香港未来政治地位的主要条款。香港将于1997年7月1日完全回归中国。在此之前，英国将管理香港，并协助维护其经济繁荣和社会稳定；中华人民共和国将在此过程中予以合作。香港将成为高度自治的特别行政区，但国防和外交事务除外。香港的社会和经济制度以及大部分现行法律将保持不变。香港特区政府将继续掌控贸易政策和贸易协定。香港将继续保持自由港地位，无需向中国缴纳任何税款。言论、集会和宗教自由等权利将得到保障。驻港的中国人民解放军部队不得干涉香港特区内部事务。撒切尔称之为“一个巧妙的想法”，邓小平称之为“辩证马克思主义和历史唯物主义的产物”的这一“一国两制”安排，在1997年后持续了50年。 +



Local reactions to the Joint Declaration were mixed.  +
Opinion polls showed that most people preferred that Hong Kong remain a British colony, but most people had come to accept that this was not a reality.  +
Although some feared the prospect of living under Chinese rule, they were glad that a deal had finally been struck.  +
While most Chinese leaders had pushed the British to try to hold on to Hong Kong, they quickly turned their attention to China once the deal was finished.  +
Some took Chinese citizenship and gave up their British awards and titles, but this was not always enough for Beijing.  +
In June 1984, Q.  +
W.  +
Lee, Lydia Dunn, and Sze-yuen Chung—all senior members of the Executive Council—were invited to visit Beijing.  +
The leader of the delegation, Chung, who had been knighted twice by the British and had originally argued for continued British administration of Hong Kong, was chastised by Deng Xiaoping for questioning China’s ability to adhere to the one country, two systems model.
当地民众对《中英联合声明》的反应不一。民意调查显示，大多数人希望香港继续留在英国殖民地，但他们也逐渐接受了这并非现实的事实。尽管有些人担心生活在中国的统治下，但他们也为最终达成协议而感到高兴。虽然大多数中国领导人曾敦促英国努力保住香港，但协议达成后，他们迅速将注意力转向中国。一些人加入了中国国籍，放弃了英国的勋章和头衔，但这并不总是能满足北京的要求。1984年6月，行政会议高级成员李锟、邓丽君和钟思远应邀访问北京。代表团团长钟思远曾两次被英国授予爵位，他最初主张英国继续管辖香港，但邓小平批评他质疑中国能否坚持“一国两制”模式。 +



For the PRC government, the Joint Declaration was a way to prepare Hong Kong for reunification as smoothly as possible and to assure Hong Kong people that their way of life would not change.  +
Still, many people in Hong Kong were frustrated, and they resented the way that the negotiations had been conducted, without their having any say in the process.  +
These feelings were captured brilliantly by Zunzi, a political cartoonist for a leading local Chinese newspaper, in a cartoon depicting Thatcher and Deng Xiaoping as parents and Hong Kong as a girl about to marry a roll of paper held by an anonymous, headless man.  +
The roll of paper represented the Joint Declaration, with the cartoon suggesting that Hong Kong’s return to China was like a traditional Chinese arranged marriage in which the bride had no say.  +
This sense of frustration and resentment helps explain the blossoming of new political groups in the early 1980s, such as the Hong Kong Prospect Institute, the New Hong Kong Society, Meeting Point, the Hong Kong Forum, the Hong Kong Affairs Society, the Hong Kong People’s Association, the Association for Democracy and Justice, and the Hong Kong Policy Viewers.  +
Although they represented a spectrum of political opinions, these groups had several common traits.  +
They were generally organized by former student activists who were now service professionals with strong links to the grassroots through their jobs.  +
Strongly committed to nationalism, democracy, and welfare capitalism, these groups used legal channels such as public seminars, news conferences, and position papers to broadcast their goals.
对中国政府而言，《中港联合声明》旨在尽可能平稳地为香港回归做好准备，并向香港市民保证他们的生活方式不会改变。然而，许多香港市民感到沮丧，他们对谈判的方式感到不满，因为他们完全没有发言权。当地一家主流中文报纸的政治漫画家尊子（Zunzi）的一幅漫画巧妙地捕捉到了这种情绪。漫画中，撒切尔夫人和邓小平被描绘成父母，而香港则被比作即将嫁给一卷纸的女子，这卷纸由一个身份不明、没有头的男子拿着。这卷纸代表《中港联合声明》，漫画暗示香港回归中国就像一场传统的中国包办婚姻，新娘毫无发言权。这种挫败感和怨恨情绪有助于解释 20 世纪 80 年代初新兴政治团体的涌现，例如香港展望研究所、新香港协会、会合点、香港论坛、香港事务协会、香港人民协会、民主与正义协会以及香港政策观察员。尽管这些团体代表了不同的政治观点，但它们也具有一些共同特征。这些团体通常由曾经的学生运动人士组织，他们如今已成为服务行业的专业人士，并通过工作与基层保持着紧密的联系。这些团体坚定地拥护民族主义、民主和福利资本主义，并利用公开研讨会、新闻发布会和立场文件等合法渠道宣传其目标。 +



For the British, the Joint Declaration was an attempt to protect Hong Kong after 1997 and to withdraw with dignity and without appearing as if they had surrendered Hong Kong and betrayed its people.  +
(Cradock called the declaration “as comprehensive protection as could be devised and agreed.”)21 This helps explain why the British made minor and belated attempts to introduce democracy to Hong Kong during the Sino-British negotiations, not only to protect Hong Kong under Chinese rule but also to make the transfer to Chinese rule more palatable to the British Parliament.  +
In July 1984 the Hong Kong government published a consultation green paper on political reform, explaining its intention to “develop progressively a system of government the authority for which is firmly rooted in Hong Kong, which is able to represent authoritatively the views of the people of Hong Kong, and which is more directly accountable to the people of Hong Kong.” The plans for reform included an indirectly elected part of the Legislative Council.  +
Although the government did not commit to direct elections, in November 1984 it published a policy white paper conceding that “the bulk of public response from all sources suggested a cautious approach with a gradual start by introducing a very small number of directly elected members in 1988 and building up to a significant number of directly elected members by 1997.”
对英国而言，《中英联合声明》旨在保护 1997 年后的香港，并力求体面地撤离，避免给人以放弃香港、背叛香港人民的印象。（克拉多克称该声明是“当时所能制定和商定的最全面的保护措施”。） 21 这有助于解释为何在中英谈判期间，英国迟迟才尝试在香港推行民主，其目的不仅在于保护香港在中国的统治下，也是为了让英国议会更容易接受香港移交中国。1984 年 7 月，香港特区政府发布了一份关于政治改革的咨询绿皮书，阐述了其“逐步建立一套权力牢牢扎根于香港、能够权威地代表香港人民意见、并对香港人民更加直接负责的政府体制”的意图。改革方案包括立法会中部分议员由选举产生。尽管政府没有承诺实行直接选举，但在 1984 年 11 月，政府发布了一份政策白皮书，承认“来自各方的大部分公众反馈表明，应采取谨慎的态度，逐步推进，从 1988 年引入极少数直接选举产生的议员，到 1997 年逐步增加直接选举产生的议员人数”。 +



The PRC proceeded with the Joint Declaration without complaint.  +
But in 1985 Xu Jiatun, the PRC’s representative in Hong Kong, accused the British of violating the Joint Declaration and trying to run Hong Kong after 1997.  +
As a compromise, the British agreed on no major reforms until after the promulgation of the Basic Law in 1990.  +
Although in 1985 the Legislative Council was expanded by twenty-four elected members (and then to twenty-six in 1988), elected members still accounted for only 40 percent of the total membership.  +
None were directly elected; rather, half were selected by functional constituencies, while the other half came from twelve electoral colleges whose members were from the lower councils.  +
On September 26, 1985, the first indirect elections were held for twelve functional constituency seats and twelve district seats for the Legislative Council (consisting of fifty-seven seats).  +
Until then, the last significant constitutional development had been in 1896, when two unofficial members were added to the Executive Council.  +
Although both the Legislative Council and the Executive Council had increased in size and Chinese members had been added to each, the overall structure of the government had not changed, nor had the relationships among the governor, the two councils, and the civil service.
中华人民共和国在未提出异议的情况下继续执行了《中英联合声明》。但1985年，中华人民共和国驻香港代表徐家屯指责英国违反《中英联合声明》，并试图在1997年后接管香港。作为妥协，英国同意在1990年《基本法》颁布之前不进行任何重大改革。尽管1985年立法会议员人数增加了24人（1988年增至26人），但民选议员仍仅占总议员人数的40%。所有议员均非直接选举产生；一半由功能区选出，另一半则由12个选举团选出，这些选举团的成员来自下议院。1985年9月26日，立法会举行了首次间接选举，选举产生12个功能区议席和12个区议席（立法会共57个议席）。在此之前，上一次重要的宪政改革是在1896年，当时行政会议增加了两名非正式成员。尽管立法会议和行政会议的规模都有所扩大，并且都增加了华人成员，但政府的整体结构并未改变，总督、立法会议和行政会议以及公务员之间的关系也未发生变化。 +



JITTERY CITY  紧张之城
Designed by renowned British architect Norman Foster, the new headquarters of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank—long a symbol of Hong Kong’s colonial status—was the world’s most expensive building when it was completed in 1985.  +
Bank and government officials hoped that the new building would convey confidence in Hong Kong’s future.  +
And although many foreign firms left Hong Kong in anticipation of the 1997 transition, even more came to take advantage of the economic opportunities provided by Hong Kong’s reintegration with China.  +
The Hong Kong government appeared to have survived the Sino-British negotiations remarkably well.  +
In surveys taken in 1985, less than 32 percent of respondents said that they trusted the PRC government, while more than 73 percent said that they trusted the Hong Kong government.
由英国著名建筑师诺曼·福斯特设计的香港上海汇丰银行新总部大楼，长期以来一直是香港殖民地地位的象征，于1985年竣工时是世界上最昂贵的建筑。银行和政府官员希望这座新大楼能够传递对香港未来的信心。尽管许多外国公司为了迎接1997年的过渡期而离开香港，但更多的公司却选择留在香港，以利用香港回归中国带来的经济机遇。香港政府似乎在中英谈判中表现出色。在1985年的调查中，只有不到32%的受访者表示信任中华人民共和国政府，而超过73%的受访者表示信任香港政府。 +



In May 1986, however, the cover of the locally based Far Eastern Economic Review described Hong Kong as a “jittery city.” After the nuclear catastrophe at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union in April of that year, people in Hong Kong became concerned about China’s plans to build a nuclear power station at Daya (Bias) Bay, about thirty miles northeast of Hong Kong.  +
The site had been chosen in 1982, and while the British, Chinese, and Hong Kong governments all supported the project, which was to be built by a French company, pressure groups such as the Joint Organization for the Concern of Nuclear Energy and the Friends of the Earth lobbied hard against it.  +
After the Chernobyl disaster, surveys showed that 77 percent of Hong Kong people opposed the project.  +
More than one million Hong Kong people signed a petition against it (although most people lost interest once the Chinese government decided to go ahead with the plan).
然而，1986 年 5 月，总部位于香港的《 远东经济评论》 的封面将香港描述为一座“焦虑不安的城市”。同年 4 月，苏联切尔诺贝利核事故发生后，香港民众开始担忧中国计划在距离香港东北约 30 英里的大亚湾（又称比阿斯湾）建造核电站。该选址于 1982 年确定，尽管英国、中国和香港政府都支持该项目（该项目将由一家法国公司承建），但诸如关注核能联合组织和地球之友等压力团体却极力游说反对。切尔诺贝利事故发生后，调查显示 77%的香港民众反对该项目。超过一百万香港民众签署了一份反对请愿书（尽管在中国政府决定继续推进该计划后，大多数人失去了兴趣）。 +



This sense of fear and uncertainty was intensified when on December 5, 1986, Governor Youde died of a heart attack in his sleep at the British embassy in Beijing, becoming the first Hong Kong governor to die in office.  +
When his body was returned to Hong Kong for the funeral and cremation, huge crowds came out to pay their respects to the governor who had fought for Hong Kong in the Sino-British negotiations even while not being allowed to represent Hong Kong officially.  +
The late governor was replaced temporarily by Chief Secretary David Akers-Jones, who served as acting governor from December 1986 until April 1987, when David Wilson, the former political advisor and China scholar, arrived in Hong Kong to take governorship.
1986年12月5日，尤德总督在北京英国大使馆睡梦中突发心脏病去世，成为首位在任期间去世的香港总督，这加剧了当时的恐惧和不安情绪。尤德的遗体被运回香港举行葬礼和火化时，大批民众前来悼念这位曾在中英谈判中为香港争取权益，却因无法正式代表香港而备受争议的总督。尤德去世后，政务司司长戴维·艾克斯-琼斯暂时接任总督一职，自1986年12月至1987年4月担任代理总督。之后，前政治顾问、中国问题专家戴维·威尔逊抵达香港，正式就任总督。 +



While some people in Hong Kong reacted to this uncertainty by taking a stronger interest in local politics, others responded by voting with their feet.  +
People had been emigrating from Hong Kong (mainly to Australia, Britain, Canada, and the United States) before and throughout the Sino-British negotiations, but the scale and intensity of emigration increased dramatically after the Joint Declaration, when Hong Kong saw a “gathering wave of emigration.” 22 Whereas some twenty thousand people left every year from 1980 to 1986, according to government figures the number rose to almost thirty thousand in 1987 and forty thousand in 1989.  +
These figures are even more significant given that they represent only the people who were actually able to find host countries willing to accept them rather than those who wanted or tried to emigrate.  +
Although Governor Wilson denied that Hong Kong was experiencing a brain drain, most of these emigrants were educated, bilingual, middle-class professionals with British passports who, denied the right of abode in Britain after the 1981 British Nationality Act, looked elsewhere for havens before the transition to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
尽管一些香港人对这种不确定性表现出更浓厚的兴趣，更加关注本地政治，但另一些人则选择了用脚投票。在中英谈判之前和谈判期间，香港人就一直在移居海外（主要前往澳大利亚、英国、加拿大和美国），但联合声明发表后，移居的规模和强度急剧增加，香港出现了一股“移民潮”。 22 1980 年至 1986 年间，每年约有两万人离开香港；而据政府统计，1987 年这一数字上升至近三万人，1989 年则达到四万人。考虑到这些数字仅代表那些最终找到愿意接收他们的接收国的人，而非那些想要或试图移民的人，因此更具意义。尽管时任港督威尔逊否认香港存在人才流失，但这些移民大多是受过良好教育、精通双语的中产阶级专业人士，持有英国护照。由于 1981 年《英国国籍法》剥夺了他们在英国的居留权，他们在 1997 年香港回归中国之前，便在其他地方寻求庇护。 +



Desperate to maintain public confidence, in May 1987 the Hong Kong government published a consultation green paper on representative government and established a survey office to track public opinion.  +
The green paper invited the Hong Kong public to choose from four options, including direct elections to the Legislative Council.  +
However, the options were presented in such a way that the issue of direct elections was obscured (the paper did not simply ask whether respondents favored direct elections).  +
When in October the survey office released its findings showing that the majority of the population did not favor direct elections, even though independent surveys showed that the overwhelming majority of people in Hong Kong favored direct elections in 1988, the local reaction was “extremely hostile.”23 Critics accused the government of manipulating the survey to postpone democratic reform.  +
Martin Lee, a lawyer and Legislative Council member, led the Delegation for Democracy and flew to London in January 1988 in an unsuccessful bid to persuade British government officials and members of Parliament to support direct elections.  +
In February 1988, the Hong Kong government published a policy white paper, which explained that because there was no “clear consensus,” direct elections would be postponed until 1991.  +
Instead, indirect elections were held in September 1988 for twenty-six seats in the fifty-seven-member Legislative Council.  +
The Hong Kong and British governments had caved to pressure from the Chinese government not to introduce democratic reforms by claiming that the people of Hong Kong did not want them—and the people of Hong Kong knew it, which made them view all three governments negatively.
为了维护公众信心，香港政府于 1987 年 5 月发布了一份关于代议制政府的咨询绿皮书，并设立了一个民意调查办公室来追踪公众意见。这份绿皮书邀请香港市民从四个选项中做出选择，其中包括立法会议员的直接选举。然而，这些选项的呈现方式却模糊了直接选举的问题（绿皮书并没有直接询问受访者是否支持直接选举）。同年 10 月，民意调查办公室公布了调查结果，显示大多数民众不支持直接选举。尽管独立调查显示，1988 年香港绝大多数民众支持直接选举，但民意调查办公室公布的结果却引发了“极其强烈的反对”。 23 批评人士指责政府操纵民意调查，以拖延民主改革。律师兼立法会议员李柱铭率领民主代表团于 1988 年 1 月飞往伦敦，试图说服英国政府官员和议员支持直接选举，但最终未能成功。 1988 年 2 月，香港特区政府发布政策白皮书，解释说由于没有“明确共识”，直接选举将推迟到 1991 年。取而代之的是，1988 年 9 月举行了间接选举，选出立法会 57 个席位中的 26 个。香港政府和英国政府屈服于中国政府的压力，放弃了推行民主改革，声称香港人民不希望改革——而香港人民也心知肚明，这使得他们对这三个政府都抱有负面看法。 +



THE BASIC LAW  基本法
Almost immediately after the Joint Declaration had been ratified, the Chinese side began to work on drafting the Basic Law.  +
While it was supposed to codify the guarantees made by China in the Joint Declaration, the Basic Law was also a chance to ensure that any political changes in Hong Kong before 1997 would comply with what China had in mind for Hong Kong after 1997.  +
But the drafting of the Basic Law also showed the inherent weaknesses in the Joint Declaration—many of them areas that had been left vague because the Sino-British negotiators had been unable to agree.  +
These vague areas for the most part enabled Britain and China to interpret the terms of the declaration in their own ways.  +
As political scientist James Tang argues, the Joint Declaration did not settle the Sino-British differences; rather, it became “the source of these differences.”24
《中英联合声明》批准后不久，中方便开始着手起草《基本法》。《基本法》旨在将中国在《中英联合声明》中作出的各项保证正式写入法律，同时也旨在确保 1997 年以前香港的任何政治变革都符合中国对 1997 年以后香港的规划。然而，《基本法》的起草过程也暴露了《中英联合声明》本身存在的缺陷——其中许多领域由于中英谈判代表未能达成一致而显得含糊不清。这些模糊之处在很大程度上使得英国和中国可以各自解读声明的条款。正如政治学家詹姆斯·唐所言，《中英联合声明》非但没有解决中英之间的分歧，反而成为了“分歧的根源”。 24 +
The main bone of contention was the pace and scope of institutional change in Hong Kong before 1997.  +
The Joint Declaration specified that the “current” institutions of Hong Kong were to remain unchanged for fifty years, but it gave no definition of “current.” The Chinese government argued that Hong Kong should return to China as it stood in 1984, when the joint agreement was signed, but the British and Hong Kong governments insisted that Hong Kong could not be frozen in time for thirteen years.  +
The Chinese government viewed any efforts to introduce political, institutional, or legislative changes as attempts to maintain a British presence after 1997.  +
Britain and China had agreed that by 1997 the Legislative Council would be “constituted by elections,” but Britain and China interpreted this differently.  +
The Chinese government firmly opposed any suggestions of universal suffrage, especially since the British had waited so long in their rule even to consider this.  +
In 1985 Xu Jiatun declared that “consultation” constituted a form of election.  +
Although the British had insisted that the Joint Declaration should specify that Hong Kong’s legislature would be “constituted by election,” the Chinese later claimed that they were unaware of the ramifications of the British definition of the term “election.” However, the British had proposed modest reforms in 1984, even before the end of the Sino-British negotiations, including indirect elections to the Legislative Council in 1985 (although these elections did not take place).
争论的焦点在于1997年之前香港制度变革的速度和范围。《中英联合声明》规定香港“现有”制度五十年内保持不变，但并未对“现有”一词作出定义。中国政府认为香港应恢复到1984年签署联合声明时的状态，但英国和香港政府坚持认为香港不能被冻结十三年。中国政府将任何试图进行政治、制度或立法改革的努力视为英国在1997年后继续统治香港的企图。英国和中国曾同意立法会到1997年“由选举产生”，但双方对此的理解存在分歧。中国政府坚决反对任何普选提议，尤其考虑到英国在其统治下如此漫长的时间里都未曾考虑过普选。1985年，徐家屯宣称“协商”本身就是一种选举形式。尽管英国方面坚持《中英联合声明》应明确规定香港立法会“由选举产生”，但中方后来声称他们并不了解英国对“选举”一词的定义所带来的影响。然而，早在1984年，甚至在中英谈判结束之前，英国就提出了一些温和的改革方案，包括1985年立法会的间接选举（尽管这些选举最终并未举行）。 +



The Basic Law took almost five years to draft.  +
On July 1, 1985, the National People’s Congress established the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee, which consisted of 59 appointed members (36 from the mainland and 23 from Hong Kong) and held its first plenum that week in Beijing.  +
On September 18, the Basic Law Consultative Committee was established in Hong Kong, consisting of 180 appointed members, all local residents.  +
In early 1986, Timothy Renton, the British Foreign Office minister for Hong Kong, announced his government’s policy of convergence, meaning that Britain would consult with China on all matters pertinent to the 1997 transition and that no political reforms would be made until after the publication of the Basic Law in 1990.  +
In fact, Britain and China had made a secret agreement in late 1985 to delay any major constitutional reforms until 1991.  +
Although Britain later argued that this arrangement forced the Chinese government to agree to more extensive political reforms in 1991 than it would have otherwise allowed, the policy of convergence was seen by many people in Hong Kong as a capitulation to the Chinese government and seriously hurt the Hong Kong government’s image.  +
The policy of convergence received symbolic approval when Queen Elizabeth visited Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and, finally Hong Kong in October 1986.
《基本法》的起草历时近五年。1985年7月1日，全国人民代表大会成立香港基本法起草委员会，由59名委任委员组成（36名来自内地，23名来自香港），并于当周在北京召开第一次全体会议。9月18日，香港成立基本法咨询委员会，由180名委任委员组成，全部为香港居民。 1986年初，英国外交部负责香港事务的国务大臣蒂莫西·伦顿宣布了英国政府的“趋同政策”，这意味着英国将就所有与1997年过渡期相关的事宜与中国进行磋商，并且在1990年《基本法》颁布之前不会进行任何政治改革。事实上，英中两国早在1985年底就达成了一项秘密协议，将任何重大宪政改革推迟到1991年。尽管英国后来辩称，这一安排迫使中国政府在1991年同意进行比其原本允许的更为广泛的政治改革，但许多香港人认为“趋同政策”是对中国政府的屈服，严重损害了香港特区政府的形象。1986年10月，伊丽莎白女王访问北京、上海、广州，最后访问香港，这象征性地认可了“趋同政策”。 +



Released in late April 1988 for a five-month public consultation, the first draft of the Basic Law provoked a storm of criticism in Hong Kong.  +
Almost seventy-five thousand submissions were received over the consultation period.  +
The amended second draft, released in late February 1989, also received a great deal of criticism during the eight-month consultation period, mainly from liberal groups but even from moderate and conservative groups, for not allowing more room for representative government.  +
The drafting process was also disrupted after the student protests in Beijing that culminated in the Tiananmen Square Massacre in June 1989.  +
Two members of the drafting committee—Louis Cha, a publisher, and Peter Kwong, the Anglican bishop—resigned after the PRC government imposed martial law on May 20.  +
The PRC excluded from the drafting committee Martin Lee and Szeto Wah, the two most vocal advocates of democratization on the committee and the founders of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China.
1988年4月下旬公布的《基本法》初稿，在香港引发了轩然大波，征求公众意见长达五个月。征求意见期间，共收到近七万五千份意见书。1989年2月下旬公布的修订版二稿，在为期八个月的征求意见期间也饱受诟病，批评者主要来自自由派团体，但也包括一些温和派和保守派团体，批评其未能赋予香港更多代表制政府的空间。1989年6月，北京爆发学生运动，最终演变为天安门事件，这也干扰了《基本法》的起草进程。5月20日，中国政府实施戒严后，起草委员会的两名成员——出版商查良镛和圣公会主教邝德华——辞职。中国政府还将李柱铭和司徒华排除在起草委员会之外，这两位是委员会中最积极的民主化倡导者，也是香港支持爱国民主运动联盟的创始人。 +



The British government tried to persuade the PRC to modify some of the clauses, including those enabling the PRC to station troops in Hong Kong and to declare a state of emergency, but instead the PRC added a new clause: Article 23, which allowed the future HKSAR to prohibit subversion against the PRC government.  +
After meeting in January to amend the law, in February 1990 the drafting committee held its ninth and final plenum in Beijing, where it adopted its final draft.  +
In accordance with a secret deal made by British and Chinese officials in January-February in Beijing, the new final draft included an amendment calling for eighteen directly elected Legislative Council seats in 1991 and twenty in 1995.  +
The British government later justified this secret deal by insisting that the compromise ensured that the Chinese would allow the new constitutional arrangement to last beyond 1997.  +
On April 4, 1990, the National People’s Congress formally enacted the Basic Law, which was then promulgated by the PRC government.
英国政府曾试图说服中华人民共和国修改部分条款，包括允许中华人民共和国在香港驻军和宣布紧急状态的条款，但中华人民共和国反而增加了一条新条款：第23条，该条款允许未来的香港特别行政区禁止颠覆中华人民共和国政府的行为。1990年1月，起草委员会召开会议修改法律，并于2月在北京举行第九次也是最后一次全体会议，通过了最终草案。根据英中官员在1月至2月间于北京达成的秘密协议，新的最终草案包含一项修正案，规定1991年立法会席位将由18人直接选举产生，1995年将增加到20人。英国政府后来辩称，这项秘密协议的合理性在于，它确保了中国允许新的宪政安排在1997年之后继续有效。1990年4月4日，全国人民代表大会正式通过了《基本法》，随后中华人民共和国政府颁布实施。 +



Most people in Hong Kong understood that while the Basic Law was the PRC government’s attempt to show Hong Kong people that it was sincere about the one country, two systems model, it was also the government’s way to show that it was in charge of Hong Kong’s post-1997 future.  +
As Hong Kong’s miniconstitution, the Basic Law promises a “high level of autonomy.” It makes Beijing responsible for Hong Kong’s foreign policy and defense but allows Hong Kong to participate independently in international organizations such as the World Trade Organization and the Olympics.  +
Although both the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law guarantee that Hong Kong’s legal and judicial systems will not be changed, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress has the ultimate authority to interpret and amend the Basic Law and to revoke any Hong Kong law that it feels violates the Basic Law.
香港大多数人都明白，《基本法》既是中华人民共和国政府向香港人民表明其对“一国两制”模式诚意之举，也是政府展现其对香港1997年后未来走向掌控权的途径。作为香港的“小宪法”，《基本法》承诺给予香港“高度自治”。它规定北京负责香港的外交和国防事务，但允许香港独立参与世界贸易组织和奥林匹克运动会等国际组织。尽管《中共中央与全民联合声明》和《基本法》都保证香港的法律和司法制度不会改变，但全国人大常委会拥有最终解释和修改《基本法》的权力，并有权撤销任何其认为违反《基本法》的香港法律。 +



THE END OF THE KOWLOON WALLED CITY
九龙城寨的终结
The tensions permeating the Sino-British negotiations and the drafting of the Basic Law would escalate after the Tiananmen Square Massacre in June 1989 as Hong Kong’s countdown toward the reversion to Chinese sovereignty drew the attention of the world.  +
Yet given the violence and warfare that often plagued the end of European rule in other colonies, the end of British rule in Hong Kong was a remarkably calm and orderly process.  +
Scarcely noticed outside of Hong Kong, one event neatly characterized the end of British rule in Hong Kong.  +
In January 1987, with the support of the PRC government, the Hong Kong government announced that the Kowloon Walled City would be demolished and turned into a public park before 1997.  +
Excluded from the 1898 lease of the New Territories but subsequently claimed by Britain after Qing troops helped villagers resist British rule in the New Territories, this small area became an independent enclave where the British generally took a hands-off approach.  +
Although the Walled City had almost disappeared by the eve of World War II, it was revived after the war and after the 1949 revolution.  +
As author Jan Morris puts it, the area “felt like an enclave within the city, extra-territorial and even slightly unreal.”25
1989 年 6 月天安门事件后，中英谈判和《基本法》起草过程中弥漫的紧张气氛进一步升级，香港回归中国的进程也吸引了全世界的目光。然而，考虑到其他殖民地结束欧洲统治时往往伴随着暴力和战争，香港的英国统治结束却出奇地平静有序。在香港以外鲜为人知的是，有一件事恰如其分地概括了香港英国统治的终结。1987 年 1 月，在中华人民共和国政府的支持下，香港特区政府宣布将在 1997 年前拆除九龙城寨，并将其改建为公园。九龙城寨原本不在 1898 年新界租约的管辖范围内，但在清军帮助村民抵抗英国在新界的统治后，英国最终将其纳入版图。这片小区域成为一块独立的飞地，英国对其采取了不干涉的态度。尽管九龙城寨在二战前夕几乎消失殆尽，但在战后和 1949 年革命后又得以复兴。正如作家简·莫里斯所说，这片区域“感觉就像城中飞地，超脱于地域之外，甚至有些不真实”。 25 +
By the 1960s, the Walled City had grown into a hodgepodge of ramshackle buildings crammed so closely together that daylight could almost not come through.  +
There was no formal sewage system, and electricity was tapped illegally through a mesh of wires that frequently led to fires.  +
The area, writes Morris, was “a frightful slum.  +
No four-wheeled vehicle could enter it—there were no streets wide enough—and its buildings, rising sometimes to ten or twelve storeys, were so inextricably packed together that they seemed to form one congealed mass of masonry, sealed together by overlapping structures, ladders, walk-ways, pipes and cables, and ventilated only by foetid air-shafts....  +
A maze of dark alleys pierced the mass from one side to the other.  +
Virtually no daylight reached them.  +
Looped electric cables festooned their low ceilings, dripping alarmingly with moisture.”26
到了 20 世纪 60 年代，九龙城寨已发展成一片破败不堪、拥挤不堪的建筑群，阳光几乎无法穿透。这里没有正规的污水处理系统，电力是通过错综复杂的电线非法接入的，经常引发火灾。莫里斯写道，这片区域“简直是人间炼狱。四轮车辆根本无法进入——街道狭窄得可怜——而那些高达十层或十二层的楼房，密密麻麻地挤在一起，仿佛凝固成一团砖石，层层叠叠的结构、梯子、走道、管道和电缆将它们密封在一起，通风也只能依靠散发着恶臭的通风井……迷宫般的黑暗小巷从一端贯穿到另一端。几乎没有阳光能够照射到这些小巷。缠绕的电缆垂挂在低矮的天花板上，滴着令人担忧的水滴。” 26 +
Like Hong Kong itself, the Walled City became a city of contradictions and nuances.  +
An internationally notorious center for drugs, gambling, and prostitution, it was also home to a close-knit community of more than thirty thousand residents with a strong sense of collective identity who lived among the shops, small factories and workshops, brothels, massage parlors, gambling dens, and unlicensed doctors and dentists.  +
Although the Walled City was often managed and policed by powerful triad societies—leading critics to contrast its lawlessness and crime with the law and order in the rest of Hong Kong—by the early 1980s the crime rates appeared to be no higher than in the surrounding region.  +
The PRC government had remained consistently ambivalent about the Walled City, never surrendering its claim to jurisdiction over the area yet never making too much of a commotion about it since that might suggest recognition of British jurisdiction over the rest of the region.  +
Thus, concludes Morris, the Walled City “remained a strange reminder of China’s stage in Hong Kong, and of the subtle, patient, cat-and-mouse way in which the Chinese viewed the progress of the colony.”27
如同香港本身一样，九龙城寨也成为了一个充满矛盾和微妙之处的城市。它曾是国际上臭名昭著的毒品、赌博和卖淫中心，同时也是一个拥有三万多居民的紧密社区，他们有着强烈的集体认同感，生活在商店、小型工厂和作坊、妓院、按摩院、赌场以及无证医生和牙医诊所之间。尽管九龙城寨经常由势力强大的三合会管理和控制——这使得批评者将其无法无天的犯罪状况与香港其他地区的治安状况形成鲜明对比——但到了 20 世纪 80 年代初，其犯罪率似乎并不比周边地区更高。中华人民共和国政府对九龙城寨的态度一直很矛盾，从未放弃对该地区的管辖权，但也从未对此大肆宣扬，因为这可能暗示承认英国对该地区其他地区的管辖权。因此，莫里斯总结道，九龙城寨“仍然是对中国在香港所处阶段的一个奇特提醒，也反映了中国人看待这片殖民地发展进程时所采取的微妙、耐心、猫捉老鼠般的策略。” 27 +
In accordance with the 1987 agreement, in 1994 the Walled City was razed and turned into a classical Chinese garden that was officially opened in December 1995 by Hong Kong’s last colonial governor, Chris Patten.  +
Just as the Joint Declaration put an end to Hong Kong’s uncertain political status, the decision to raze the Walled City signaled that China would regain full sovereignty over the region after 1997.  +
As historian Seth Harter argues, recreating a classical Chinese garden where the Walled City once stood consciously stresses Hong Kong’s original Chineseness rather than the East-West hybridity that has defined much of Hong Kong’s history since the arrival of the British.  +
The style of the garden comes from the early Qing era, the “highpoint” of pre-Opium War Chinese cultural and economic development and territorial integrity, a period in which China was “virtually unmolested by European colonialism” and during which imperial control over Guangdong and the Hong Kong region reached its zenith.  +
Just as the Joint Declaration reunites long-lost Hong Kong with the rest of China, this “purely Chinese” garden unites Hong Kong’s precolonial past with its postcolonial present and future.28
根据 1987 年的协议，九龙城寨于 1994 年被夷为平地，改建为一座古典中式园林，并于 1995 年 12 月由香港末任总督彭定康正式揭幕。正如《中港联合声明》终结了香港不确定的政治地位一样，拆除九龙城寨的决定也标志着中国将在 1997 年后重新获得对香港的完全主权。正如历史学家塞思·哈特所论证的那样，在九龙城寨原址重建一座古典中式园林，旨在强调香港的中国传统，而非自英国殖民统治以来主导香港历史的“东西方融合”风格。这座园林的风格源自清初，即鸦片战争前中国文化经济发展和领土完整的“鼎盛时期”，当时中国“几乎未受欧洲殖民主义侵扰”，英国对广东和香港地区的统治也达到了顶峰。正如《中英联合声明》使失散多年的香港与中国其他地区重新统一一样，这座“纯粹的中国式”花园也将香港的殖民前历史与后殖民时代的现在和未来连接起来 。28 +
