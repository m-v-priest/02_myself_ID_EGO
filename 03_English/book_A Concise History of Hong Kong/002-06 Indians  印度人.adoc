.Parsis
帕西人（Parsi 或 Parsees ， /ˈpɑːrsiz/ ）是印度次大陆的一个琐罗亚斯德教民族。 [ 5 ] 他们的祖先是波斯难民，这些难民在公元 7 世纪阿拉伯-伊斯兰征服伊朗期间及之后, 迁徙到印度次大陆. +
他们在文化、语言和社会方面都与伊朗人（Iranis） 截然不同。

*“帕西”（Parsi ）一词源于波斯语 ，字面意思是 “波斯人”.*

**虽然帕西人最初是来自波斯，但大部分印度帕西人都已失去与波斯的社会或家族联系，与波斯已经没有共通的语言。**在自从第一批祆教徒到达印度后的数百年间，帕西人已经将自己融入印度社会，但同时保持自己独特的风俗和传统。因此帕西人具有特殊的身份 - 他们在国籍、语言和历史方面是印度人，但在血缘、文化、行为和宗教习惯方面不是印度人（只占印度总人口的0.006%）.

鸦片战争以前，已有帕西人到广州经商。据东印度公司保存的资料，1809 年广州有24 家外国私人公司运作，其中只有一家是英国公司，其他多数是帕西商人[4]。

.Zoroastrianism 祆教

**是伊斯兰教诞生之前, 中东和西亚最具影响力的宗教，**古代波斯帝国的国教。[4]*因信徒在火前祷告而又得名为拜火教，又称为火祆教或白头教。*

香港的非华裔人口中也包括许多印度人。其中就包括帕西商人，他们是殖民地时期香港最早的地主之一。与孟买一样，帕西人在香港以其商业头脑、诚实和慈善精神而闻名。尽管帕西社群规模不大，但一些成员通过鸦片贸易积累了巨额财富。尽管他们拥有财富，忠于英国王室，且慷慨大方，帕西人却被欧洲社会所排斥。他们大多自成一派，并于1854年获准拥有自己的墓地。然而，香港的大多数印度人是穆斯林和锡克教徒，他们以商人、士兵和警察的身份来到香港。由于印度人不太可能帮助中国囚犯越狱，因此他们通常被雇用为警察和狱警。从一开始，香港的印度人口就以男性为主。例如，1845年，362名印第安人（不包括驻军中的印第安士兵）中，346名是成年男性，其余为妇女和儿童。由于被欧洲人和中国人排斥，这些印第安人仍然保持着自己的社群。 +
