As in other colonies, colonialism in Hong Kong could be repressive and yet offer opportunities.  +
Until the 1860s, when the British presence in China shifted to Shanghai, Hong Kong provided several economic and diplomatic functions for Britain.  +
It was from Hong Kong, which was the British headquarters for the China trade, that the British plenipotentiary and superintendent of trade administered all British subjects in China.  +
(After John Bowring retired in 1859, the office of Hong Kong governor was separated from that of plenipotentiary and superintendent of trade in China.) The colony was a naval station and the first port of call after Singapore for European travelers.  +
Hong Kong also provided the security and the freedom of movement and residence that the treaty ports did not.  +
These functions all meant that Hong Kong offered a variety of opportunities for Chinese to serve as contractors, laborers, servants, clerks, and interpreters.
与其他殖民地一样，香港的殖民统治既充满压迫，也蕴藏机遇。直到19世纪60年代英国在华的势力转移至上海之前，香港为英国提供了诸多经济和外交职能。香港是英国对华贸易的总部，英国全权代表兼贸易总监在此管理所有在华英国臣民。（1859年鲍林退休后，香港总督一职与英国全权代表兼贸易总监的职位分离。）香港曾是海军基地，也是欧洲旅行者在新加坡之后的首选停靠港。此外，香港还提供了条约港口所不具备的安全保障以及行动和居住的自由。所有这些职能都意味着香港为华人提供了各种各样的机会，他们可以担任承包商、劳工、佣人、文员和翻译等职务。 +

== Europeans  欧洲人

Europeans in early Hong Kong fell into five main groups: colonial officials, merchants, professionals, those in supervisory or low-status jobs, and missionaries for groups such as the London Missionary Society.  +
Working for a firm such as the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank provided a much better lifestyle than British clerks were used to back home.  +
Many Portuguese from old families in Macau, often educated by Catholic missions there and in Hong Kong, worked for the colonial government and for British firms as clerks and interpreters.  +
The European working class consisted mainly of policemen, government inspectors, supervisors and overseers, soldiers, naval and merchant sailors, mechanics, artisans, and prostitutes who came to Hong Kong mainly because the pay was better than in Britain.  +
Although he preferred the Mediterranean feel of Portuguese Macau, George Chinnery, the best known of the China trade painters, spent some time in Hong Kong.  +
The early European population also included a small group of beachcombers, wanderers, and outcasts—usually discharged seamen, deserters, or criminals.  +
Like the Chinese community, the European community in early Hong Kong was overwhelmingly male.  +
Some European women worked as maids or nursemaids, while a few owned their own dress and millinery shops.
早期香港的欧洲人主要分为五大类：殖民官员、商人、专业人士、从事管理或低地位工作的人员，以及为伦敦传教会等团体服务的传教士。在香港上海汇丰银行等公司工作，生活水平远胜于英国本土的职员。许多来自澳门古老家族的葡萄牙人，往往在澳门和香港接受过天主教传教机构的教育，他们为殖民政府和英国公司担任职员和翻译。欧洲工人阶级主要由警察、政府督察、监工和监工、士兵、海军和商船水手、机械师、工匠以及妓女组成，他们来到香港的主要原因是这里的薪水比英国高。尽管乔治·钦纳里（George Chinnery）——中国贸易画家中最著名的一位——更喜欢葡萄牙澳门的地中海风情，但他也在香港生活过一段时间。早期的欧洲人口中还包括一小群拾荒者、流浪者和被社会遗弃者——通常是被开除的海员、逃兵或罪犯。与华人社区一样，早期香港的欧洲社区也以男性为主。一些欧洲女性从事女佣或保姆的工作，少数人则拥有自己的服装和女帽店。 +
Visitors to Hong Kong were frequently struck by the aloofness of the local Europeans, their lack of interest in Chinese culture, and their scorn and disdain for the local Chinese, and noted how they would beat Chinese workers with sticks and umbrellas.  +
In 1877 a visiting Englishman complained that British military officers abused Chinese “as if they were a very inferior kind of animal to themselves.”5 Europeans often treated Chinese rickshaw pullers very poorly and rudely, throwing their coins on the ground instead of handing them to the puller and often even beating them.  +
Yet there was never one single European or British attitude toward the Chinese of Hong Kong any more than there was one type of European.  +
Europeans in Hong Kong could be more accepting of wealthier Chinese, especially those who spoke English and engaged in philanthropic activities.  +
As historian G.  +
B.  +
Endacott writes, the European population of early Hong Kong had its share of both “greedy self-seeking adventurers” and “men of high principle devoted to the public welfare.”6 And although European women could be as racist as men, they often took a great interest in the problems facing the Chinese community.
到访香港的游客常常对当地欧洲人的冷漠、对中国文化的漠不关心以及对当地华人的蔑视和鄙夷感到震惊，他们注意到欧洲人会用棍棒和雨伞殴打中国工人。1877 年，一位到访的英国人抱怨说，英国军官虐待华人，“仿佛他们是比自己低等的动物”。 5 欧洲人常常对中国黄包车夫态度恶劣、粗鲁无礼，他们把硬币扔在地上而不是递给车夫，甚至经常殴打他们。然而，欧洲人或英国人对待香港华人的态度并非千篇一律，正如欧洲人本身也并非只有一种类型一样。在香港的欧洲人可能更容易接受较为富裕的华人，尤其是那些会说英语并热衷于慈善事业的人。正如历史学家 G.B.  +
Endacott 所写，早期香港的欧洲居民中既有“贪婪自私的冒险家”，也有“致力于公共福祉的高尚人士” 。6 虽然欧洲女性有时也会像男性一样抱有种族歧视，但她们通常对华人社区面临的问题非常关心。 +
It would also be unfair to ignore the many problems facing Europeans in early Hong Kong, not the least of which was the high mortality rate mainly from tropical diseases such as malaria.  +
The mortality rate for European women was especially high, particularly for missionaries.  +
One of the first Western women in Hong Kong, Henrietta Shuck, was an American missionary who died from complications after childbirth in November 1844.  +
Mary Legge, wife of the missionary James Legge, died at the age of thirty-six in October 1852.  +
Governor Bowring’s daughter, Emily, who became a Cannosian Sister and helped open several mission schools, died at the age of thirty-seven.
忽视早期欧洲人在香港面临的诸多问题也是不公平的，其中最主要的问题是高死亡率，主要由疟疾等热带疾病引起。欧洲女性的死亡率尤其高，尤其是传教士。最早来到香港的西方女性之一，美国传教士亨丽埃塔·舒克，于1844年11月因产后并发症去世。传教士詹姆斯·莱格的妻子玛丽·莱格于1852年10月去世，年仅36岁。鲍林总督的女儿艾米莉，后来成为嘉诺撒修女，并协助创办了几所教会学校，也于37岁时去世。 +
While most Europeans in Hong Kong saw themselves as members of a special community distinct from the Chinese, Indian, and Eurasian communities, visiting Europeans frequently noticed the many divisions within Hong Kong’s European community.  +
The Portuguese, who were more likely than the British to marry Chinese and to speak Cantonese, appear to have ranked intermediate between other Europeans and Eurasians.  +
They generally lived in Kowloon after it was ceded in 1860, their identity strengthened by their residential separateness.  +
The British were more obsessed than the other communities with social status.  +
Living on Victoria Peak, the highest point on Hong Kong Island and overlooking the main business district, was the pinnacle of social status.  +
The Peak, explained an anonymous writer for a local English-language newspaper, “looks down on everything and everybody”7 Perched high above the rest of the colony, the Peak resembled Simla, the Indian hill station north of Delhi.  +
Geographically and socially isolated, the Peak had all the features of a self-sufficient, quaint English town: English-style homes and villas, clubs, a hotel, a private hospital, an Anglican church, and the Peak Tram, opened in May 1888.  +
Apart from residence, British social status was represented primarily though membership in such elite clubs as the Hong Kong Club, the Cricket Club, the Jockey Club, and the Ladies Recreation Club.  +
None of the major European clubs in Hong Kong admitted Chinese.  +
Founded in 1846, the Hong Kong Club originally excluded “shopkeepers, Chinese, Indians, women and other undesirables.”
虽然大多数在港的欧洲人认为自己属于一个特殊的社群，与华人、印度人和欧亚混血社群截然不同，但到访的欧洲人经常会注意到香港欧洲社群内部的诸多分歧。葡萄牙人比英国人更有可能与华人通婚，也更常说粤语，他们的社会地位似乎介于其他欧洲人和欧亚混血人之间。1860 年九龙割让后，他们大多居住在九龙，居住上的独立性强化了他们的身份认同。英国人比其他社群更看重社会地位。居住在太平山顶——香港岛的最高点，俯瞰主要商业区——是社会地位的巅峰。一位匿名作者在当地一家英文报纸上写道，太平山顶“俯瞰一切，也俯瞰所有人”。7 太平山顶高耸于殖民地其他地区之上，宛如印度德里以北的山城西姆拉。山顶地理位置偏僻，社会环境也相对封闭，却拥有一个自给自足、古朴雅致的英国小镇的所有特征：英式住宅和别墅、俱乐部、酒店、私人医院、圣公会教堂，以及于 1888 年 5 月开通的山顶缆车。除了居住于此，英国人的社会地位主要体现在加入香港俱乐部、板球俱乐部、赛马俱乐部和女子会等精英俱乐部上。香港的主要欧洲俱乐部均不接纳华人。香港俱乐部成立于 1846 年，最初将“店主、华人、印度人、妇女及其他不受欢迎的人”拒之门外。 +

Sociologists have attributed this obsession with social status mainly to how, whatever their claims and pretensions to the contrary, most Britons in Hong Kong actually came from the British middle class.  +
There was no real aristocracy, and unlike in British colonies such as India, British officials and traders in Hong Kong were relatively equal in social status.  +
Even working-class whites generally were foremen or supervisors, so they always had Chinese below them.  +
This obsession with social status within the European community caused the creation of social clubs and interest groups, which strengthened the European community by providing recognized patterns of behavior and determining the means and rules for leadership.  +
Rather than weaken the cohesiveness of the European community, the many social divisions helped that community maintain a sense of unity in an alien and confusing culture.
社会学家认为，这种对社会地位的执着主要源于这样一个事实：尽管香港的英国人声称或标榜自己并非如此，但实际上他们大多来自英国中产阶级。香港并不存在真正的贵族阶层，而且与印度等英国殖民地不同，香港的英国官员和商人的社会地位相对平等。即使是白人工人阶级，通常也只是工头或主管，因此他们的下属总是华人。这种对社会地位的执着促使欧洲人社群内部出现了各种社交俱乐部和利益集团，这些俱乐部和集团通过提供公认的行为模式，并确定领导方式和规则，从而加强了欧洲人社群的凝聚力。众多的社会阶层划分非但没有削弱欧洲人社群的凝聚力，反而帮助该社群在陌生而令人困惑的文化环境中保持了团结感。 +
Eurasians  欧亚人
Early Hong Kong also had a sizable Eurasian population, usually the progeny of relations between European men and Chinese women.  +
Eurasians had a complex and often confusing position in Hong Kong society that defies any rigid categorization.  +
“Neither fish nor fowl,” explains author May Holdsworth, Eurasians “hovered between Caucasians for whom they symbolized shameful liaisons with native women, and the Chinese community which, holding strict ideas about kinship and lineage, scorned anyone who couldn’t emblazon his father’s name on an ancestral tablet.”8
早期香港也拥有相当数量的欧亚混血人口，他们通常是欧洲男性与中国女性结合的后代。欧亚混血儿在香港社会中的地位复杂且常常令人困惑，难以进行任何僵化的分类。正如作家梅·霍尔兹沃斯所解释的那样，“他们既非鱼也非鸟”，欧亚混血儿“徘徊在白人社群和华人社群之间。在白人社群眼中，欧亚混血儿象征着与本地女性的可耻通婚；而在华人社群中，由于其对血缘和世系有着严格的观念，任何无法在祖先牌位上刻上父亲名字的人都会受到鄙视。” 8 +
Given that colonialism was based primarily on racial and class divisions, Eurasians posed a threat to Europeans because of their precarious racial and social status.  +
They were, according to Vicky Lee, “liable to a double distrust, for having a different identity in the first place, but also for not really having an identity at all, being neither one thing nor the other, and consequently sneaky and opportunistic.”9 Unlike the Portuguese in Macau, the British in Hong Kong never saw miscegenation as a positive practice that would promote racial harmony and stability.  +
On the contrary, many Europeans considered Eurasians to resemble the “mean whites of the Southern States of America,” while colonial officials frequently worried that colonial mixing produced a new category of “wavering classes.” John Bowring once expressed concern that the “children of native mothers by foreigners of all classes” were “beginning to ripen into a dangerous element out of the dunghill of neglect.”10
鉴于殖民主义主要建立在种族和阶级分化之上，欧亚混血儿因其岌岌可危的种族和社会地位而对欧洲人构成威胁。正如维姬·李所言，他们“容易受到双重不信任：首先，他们拥有不同的身份；其次，他们根本没有真正的身份，既非此也非彼，因此显得狡猾而投机。” 9 与澳门的葡萄牙人不同，香港的英国人从未将混血视为促进种族和谐与稳定的积极做法。相反，许多欧洲人认为欧亚混血儿类似于“美国南部各州的卑鄙白人”，而殖民官员则经常担心殖民混血会产生一个新的“摇摆阶级”。约翰·鲍林曾表达过这样的担忧：“本地母亲与各阶层外国人所生的孩子”正在“从被忽视的粪堆中滋生出危险分子”。 10 +
As in other European colonies, the growth of the Eurasian population produced all sorts of fears among the local European community about miscegenation, disease, and biological and moral contamination.  +
Yet many Eurasians prospered in Hong Kong.  +
Because Eurasians were locally born residents who usually spoke both English and Chinese, Europeans often considered them more trustworthy, loyal, and reliable than the pure Chinese.  +
As in other Asian colonies, Eurasians in Hong Kong often filled commercial and government clerical posts.  +
Some Eurasians, such as the Ho brothers—Robert Ho Tung, Ho Kam Tong, and Ho Fook—became fabulously wealthy businessmen and leaders of the Chinese business community.  +
Still, they often remained socially ostracized by both Europeans and Chinese.  +
Many thus married into other Eurasian families, creating a distinct Eurasian community with its own cemetery.
如同其他欧洲殖民地一样，欧亚混血人口的增长在当地欧洲社群中引发了各种各样的担忧，包括种族通婚、疾病以及生物和道德上的污染。然而，许多欧亚混血儿在香港取得了成功。由于欧亚混血儿是本地居民，通常能说流利的英语和汉语，欧洲人往往认为他们比纯种中国人更值得信赖、忠诚可靠。与其他亚洲殖民地一样，香港的欧亚混血儿经常担任商业和政府的文职职位。一些欧亚混血儿，例如何氏三兄弟——何东、何锦塘和何福——成为了极其富有的商人，并成为华人商界的领袖。尽管如此，他们仍然常常受到欧洲人和华人的社会排斥。因此，许多人选择与其他欧亚混血家庭通婚，形成了一个独特的欧亚混血社群，并拥有了自己的墓地。 +

Indians  印度人
Hong Kong’s non-Chinese population also included many Indians.  +
Among them were Parsee traders, who were some of the first landowners in colonial Hong Kong.  +
As in Bombay, the Parsees became known in Hong Kong for their business acumen, honesty, and philanthropy.  +
Although the Parsee community was small, some members became very prosperous through the opium trade.  +
Despite their wealth, loyalty to the British Crown, and generosity, the Parsees were excluded from the European social world.  +
For the most part they formed their own community and were granted their own cemetery in 1854.  +
The majority of Hong Kong’s Indians, however, were Muslims and Sikhs who came to Hong Kong as traders, soldiers, and policemen.  +
Indians were often employed as police and prison warders since they would be less likely to help Chinese prisoners escape.  +
From the beginning, the Indian population was overwhelmingly male.  +
In 1845, for example, 346 of the 362 Indians (excluding the Indian troops in the garrison) were adult males, the rest being women and children.  +
Excluded by both Europeans and Chinese, these Indians remained their own community.
香港的非华裔人口中也包括许多印度人。其中就包括帕西商人，他们是殖民地时期香港最早的地主之一。与孟买一样，帕西人在香港以其商业头脑、诚实和慈善精神而闻名。尽管帕西社群规模不大，但一些成员通过鸦片贸易积累了巨额财富。尽管他们拥有财富，忠于英国王室，且慷慨大方，帕西人却被欧洲社会所排斥。他们大多自成一派，并于1854年获准拥有自己的墓地。然而，香港的大多数印度人是穆斯林和锡克教徒，他们以商人、士兵和警察的身份来到香港。由于印度人不太可能帮助中国囚犯越狱，因此他们通常被雇用为警察和狱警。从一开始，香港的印度人口就以男性为主。例如，1845年，362名印第安人（不包括驻军中的印第安士兵）中，346名是成年男性，其余为妇女和儿童。由于被欧洲人和中国人排斥，这些印第安人仍然保持着自己的社群。 +
GOVERNMENT, LAW, AND THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE
政府、法律和司法行政
Many interrelated factors shaped Hong Kong’s early governmental system.  +
Because organizing the early colony went hand in hand with developing the China trade, until 1860 the governor had three distinct jobs: negotiating with Chinese authorities, protecting British trade in China, and regulating Hong Kong’s economy.  +
After the British won diplomatic privileges in the Treaty of Tientsin and the Convention of Peking, the Foreign Office took over the China side, leaving the governor to concentrate on Hong Kong.  +
Because the British government was determined to keep the colony running as cheaply as possible, this meant very little money for social welfare or education.  +
In addition, any concern for the colony’s Chinese residents was limited mainly to keeping them under control and preventing them from harming the interests of the local European community.
香港早期政府体制的形成受到诸多相互关联的因素影响。由于早期殖民地的建设与发展对华贸易密不可分，1860年以前，总督身兼三职：与中国当局谈判、保护英国在华贸易以及监管香港经济。英国在《天津条约》和《北京条约》中赢得外交特权后，外交部接管了对华事务，总督得以专注于香港事务。由于英国政府决心尽可能降低殖民地的运营成本，这意味着社会福利和教育方面的投入非常有限。此外，对殖民地华人居民的关怀也主要局限于控制他们，防止他们损害当地欧洲社群的利益。 +
Constitutional Frameworks
宪法框架
According to Hong Kong’s constitution, laid out in the Letters Patent of April 5, 1843, Hong Kong would be run by a governor appointed by the British Crown.  +
The governor would administer the colony with help from a lieutenant governor, a colonial secretary, an Executive Council, and a Legislative Council.  +
The two councils were each to have both official and nonofficial members appointed by the governor.  +
Often described as the governor’s cabinet, the Executive Council was mainly an advisory body with members drawn primarily from the British business elite.  +
Its members, however, sometimes disagreed with the governor and served to restrain his power.  +
Until the 1880s, members of the Legislative Council were almost all non-Chinese.  +
Although this basic constitutional framework saw minor modifications over the years, it experienced no significant changes until the early 1980s.
根据1843年4月5日颁布的《香港特许状》，香港由英国王室任命的总督管辖。总督在副总督、殖民地秘书、行政会议和立法会议的协助下管理殖民地。行政会议和立法会议均由总督任命的官员和非官员组成。行政会议常被视为总督的内阁，主要是一个咨询机构，其成员主要来自英国商界精英。然而，行政会议成员有时也会与总督意见相左，从而制约总督的权力。直到19世纪80年代，立法会议的成员几乎全部是非华裔。尽管这一基本宪政框架在多年间虽有细微修改，但在20世纪80年代初之前并未发生重大变化。 +
The issue of political representation arose early in Hong Kong’s history.  +
In August 1845, British merchants petitioned Governor John Davis for less taxation and more representation.  +
The Colonial Office, however, agreed with Davis that this would give the British merchants too much power over the majority Chinese.  +
In 1856, Bowring suggested that taxpayers (including Chinese) who owned land worth more than ten British pounds should be given the right to elect one member of the Legislative Council.  +
The Colonial Office rejected Bowring’s proposal on the grounds that representation would enable Chinese interests to dominate and that the Chinese were not ready for representation.  +
Colonial Secretary Henry Labouchere explained that with “perhaps a few honourable exceptions,” the Chinese of Hong Kong, like most members of “the Chinese race,” were “very deficient in the most essential elements of morality.”11
政治代表权问题在香港历史上早期就已出现。1845 年 8 月，英国商人向总督约翰·戴维斯请愿，要求减税并增加代表权。然而，殖民地事务部同意戴维斯的观点，认为这将赋予英国商人对占多数的华人过大的权力。1856 年，鲍林建议，拥有价值超过十英镑土地的纳税人（包括华人）应有权选举一名立法会议员。殖民地事务部以代表权会使华人利益占据主导地位，以及华人尚未做好接受代表权的准备为由，驳回了鲍林的提议。殖民地大臣亨利·拉布谢尔解释说，除了“少数值得尊敬的例外”，香港华人与大多数“中华民族”成员一样，“在最基本的道德方面非常缺乏”。 11 +
After this there were few calls for representation.  +
Although local European merchants wanted some form of municipal government, they were determined that their Chinese counterparts should not be included.  +
These Europeans feared that any such proposals for representation would involve giving too much power to the Chinese of Hong Kong, which not only might harm British interests but might also help the Qing take control of Hong Kong.  +
Nor were there ever any serious demands from the Chinese community.  +
Rather, most calls for constitutional reform came from European merchants who felt that the government needed to protect the interests of the European community and be more like the colonial governments in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
此后，要求代表权的呼声寥寥无几。尽管当地欧洲商人希望建立某种形式的市政机构，但他们坚决反对将华人纳入其中。这些欧洲人担心，任何此类代表权提案都会赋予香港华人过大的权力，这不仅可能损害英国的利益，还可能帮助清政府控制香港。此外，华人社群也从未提出过任何实质性的要求。相反，大多数宪政改革的呼声都来自欧洲商人，他们认为政府需要维护欧洲社群的利益，并更像加拿大、澳大利亚和新西兰的殖民地政府。 +
Law and the Administration of Justice
法律与司法行政
The first legal concern for the British was whether the Chinese in Hong Kong should be governed according to British or Chinese law.  +
This consideration was grounded both in legal theory and practice throughout the empire and in the specific local conditions of Hong Kong.  +
Because the British selectively incorporated the legal traditions of the people they conquered, as more territories were incorporated the empire inherited a web of legal systems that combined English common law, British statutory law, and local customary law.  +
Part of the reason for incorporating local law was practical: the British realized that they could not impose radical changes on areas as large and diverse, for example, as India.  +
But another reason was the belief that non-British peoples could be ruled only through their own native systems.  +
Also, during the negotiations for the Treaty of Nanking, Qing officials had demanded that Chinese in Hong Kong be subject to Chinese legal jurisdiction.  +
The result was some allowance for Chinese law and custom as long as they did not violate British prohibitions against slavery.
英国人首要的法律考量是香港华人应受英国法律还是中国法律管辖。这一考量既基于整个帝国的法律理论和实践，也基于香港的具体情况。由于英国有选择地吸收了被征服民族的法律传统，随着更多领土的并入，帝国继承了一张由英国普通法、英国成文法和当地习惯法交织而成的法律体系网络。吸收当地法律的部分原因是出于实际考虑：英国人意识到，他们无法对像印度这样幅员辽阔、文化多元的地区进行彻底的改革。但另一个原因是，他们认为非英国民族只能通过其自身的本土法律体系进行统治。此外，在《南京条约》的谈判中，清政府官员曾要求香港华人接受中国法律管辖。最终的结果是，只要不违反英国禁止奴隶制的规定，中国法律和习俗就得到了一定的保留。 +
Until recently, historians have generally assumed that this arrangement left the Chinese population of Hong Kong mainly to its own devices.  +
The early British vision of colonial Hong Kong was frequently called “Anglo-China,” which in the words of Christopher Munn meant “a model of British good government, a living exhibition of European civilization, a meeting point between east and west, where the manners, institutions and technologies of both cultures would engage each other in a productive and beneficial way.” Because the colonial government failed to help Hong Kong fulfill this vision and was unable to obtain reliable help from the local Chinese leadership, until the late 1800s both the government and European residents increasingly viewed the majority of Hong Kong’s Chinese population as criminals.  +
Hong Kong had one of the largest police forces in the British Empire, a huge military presence, an elaborate system of monopolies and taxes, and oppressive curfews and registration programs for controlling the majority Chinese population.  +
With a criminal justice system that created new offenses and punishments applicable only to them, the Chinese in Hong Kong “lived under a constantly changing, labyrinthine system of intrusive regulatory laws and policing practices, which increasingly criminalized many daily activities and brought thousands of people into direct contact with the police and the courts.”12
直到最近，历史学家普遍认为，这种安排使得香港华人居民基本上只能自谋生路。早期英国对殖民地香港的设想常被称为“英中”，正如克里斯托弗·蒙恩所言，其含义是“英国良好治理的典范，欧洲文明的鲜活展示，东西方文化的交汇点，两种文化的礼仪、制度和技术在此相互促进，互惠互利”。由于殖民政府未能帮助香港实现这一愿景，也未能从当地华人领袖那里获得可靠的支持，直到 19 世纪末，政府和欧洲居民都日益将香港的大多数华人视为罪犯。香港拥有大英帝国规模最大的警察部队之一，庞大的军队驻扎，一套复杂的垄断和税收体系，以及严苛的宵禁和登记制度，以此来控制占人口多数的华人。由于香港的刑事司法系统不断创设新的罪行和刑罚，且这些罪行和刑罚仅适用于香港华人，香港华人“生活在一个不断变化、错综复杂的侵入性监管法律和警务实践体系之下，该体系日益将许多日常活动定为犯罪，并使成千上万的人与警察和法院直接接触。” 12 +
Hong Kong’s early criminal justice system was supposed to blend the best of the Chinese and English systems.  +
In practice, argues Munn, “the Chinese in the colony got the worst of both worlds.  +
Heavy policing and a mesh of mystifying legislation designed to regulate behaviour that would have been regulated by other means in China brought them into more frequent contact with the authorities than they would have experienced at home.”13 Nor was the administration of justice in Hong Kong in accordance with legal practices in England.  +
Because the chief magistrate was part of the executive branch rather than an independent judiciary, he was often more concerned with fighting crime than administering justice.  +
Early magistrates were very poorly qualified or even unqualified.  +
Instead, the government relied on so-called China experts such as Chief Magistrate William Caine, who was often implicated in corruption and was so well known for his harsh punishments that the British House of Commons expressed concerns.  +
The Hong Kong Supreme Court had no grand jury to determine if prosecutions should go to trial.  +
The attorney general served as the public prosecutor.  +
Juries were small, consisting of six men who were almost all European.
香港早期的刑事司法制度本应融合中英两国制度的优点。然而，正如蒙恩所言，在实践中，“殖民地华人却遭受了两种制度的弊端。严密的警力部署和错综复杂的法律法规，使得他们在香港与当局的接触比在国内更为频繁。” 13 此外，香港的司法行政也不符合英国的法律惯例。由于首席裁判官隶属于行政部门而非独立的司法机构，他往往更关注打击犯罪而非伸张正义。早期的裁判官资质低下，甚至根本不具备资格。政府转而依赖所谓的“中国专家”，例如首席裁判官威廉·凯恩。凯恩经常卷入贪污丑闻，并因其严厉的刑罚而臭名昭著，以至于英国下议院都对此表示担忧。香港最高法院没有大陪审团来决定是否提起公诉。总检察长兼任公诉人。陪审团规模很小，由六名几乎全是欧洲人的男子组成。 +
Colonial officials’ frequent declarations to the contrary, the administration of justice in early Hong Kong law was not impartial.  +
Courts often presumed that Chinese defendants were guilty, and judges such as John Walter Hulme were known for being especially tough on non-European defendants.  +
Unfamiliar with British law, Chinese were less able to appeal unfavorable verdicts.  +
They were often charged and convicted for very minor offenses.  +
Because many Europeans believed that Chinese were undeterred by “easy” British justice, Chinese were usually punished more severely than Europeans.  +
Public flogging was routinely applied to Chinese because many colonists believed that poor Chinese preferred the colonial jail to life on the street.  +
Punishments such as caning and wearing the cangue were applied only to Chinese.  +
In March 1859, after two British nationals were hanged for killing a Chinese boy, Colonial Secretary William Mercer offered the executions as an example of how “under the authority of British law, equal justice is dealt to all persons without regard to nation, to blood, or to any accidental circumstances whatsoever.” Although this execution is said to have impressed Chinese authorities in Kowloon with the quality of British justice, crimes committed by Europeans against Chinese were generally treated more lightly than those committed by Chinese against Europeans.
尽管殖民官员经常宣称司法公正，但早期香港的法律实践并非如此。法庭往往假定华人被告有罪，而像约翰·沃尔特·休姆这样的法官更是以对非欧洲裔被告格外严厉而闻名。由于不熟悉英国法律，华人上诉的能力较弱。他们常常因轻微罪行而被起诉和定罪。因为许多欧洲人认为华人不会被英国“宽松”的司法制度吓倒，所以华人通常比欧洲人受到更严厉的惩罚。公开鞭刑是华人的惯常刑罚，因为许多殖民者认为贫穷的华人宁愿待在殖民地监狱也不愿流落街头。诸如鞭笞和戴头巾之类的刑罚只适用于华人。 1859年3月，两名英国公民因杀害一名中国男孩而被处以绞刑。殖民地大臣威廉·默瑟将此次处决作为例证，说明“在英国法律的权威下，所有人都将受到平等的司法对待，不分国籍、血统或任何偶然因素”。尽管据说这次处决给九龙的中国当局留下了深刻的印象，让他们对英国的司法质量有了更充分的认识，但欧洲人对华人犯下的罪行通常比华人对欧洲人犯下的罪行受到更轻的处罚。 +
The colonial legislature also passed various ordinances applying only to the Chinese population.  +
In October 1842, after a rash of gang robberies, Caine issued a proclamation prohibiting all Chinese, except for watchmen, from walking in the streets after 11:00 p.m.  +
After 1845, the registrar general had the right to enter any house inhabited by Chinese; all Chinese households had to be registered with the government, as did Chinese servants working for Europeans.  +
An ordinance passed in 1857 during the Second Opium War required Chinese to carry night passes issued by the superintendent of police.  +
It also allowed any European “acting as a Sentry or Patrol at any time between the hour of Eight in the Evening and Sunrise” to “fire upon, with intent or effect to kill, any Chinaman whom he shall meet with or discover abroad and whom he shall have reasonable ground to suspect of being so abroad for an improper purpose, and who being challenged by him shall neglect or refuse to make proper answer to his challenge.”14
殖民地立法机构还通过了多项仅适用于华人居民的法令。1842 年 10 月，在发生一系列团伙抢劫案后，凯恩颁布法令，禁止除守夜人外的所有华人于晚上 11 点后在街上行走。1845 年后，登记总署署长有权进入任何华人居住的房屋；所有华人家庭都必须向政府登记，为欧洲人工作的华人佣人也一样。1857 年第二次鸦片战争期间通过的一项法令要求华人必须携带由警察局长签发的夜间通行证。它还允许任何欧洲人在“晚上八点至日出之间的任何时间担任哨兵或巡逻员”时，“向其在国外遇到或发现的任何中国人开火，意图或实际杀死该中国人，只要他有合理理由怀疑该中国人出国目的不正当，且该中国人被他质问后疏忽或拒绝做出适当回应。” 14 +
Although most of the discriminatory measures of the 1857 ordinances were removed in 1858, a wave of other ordinances followed.  +
The Victoria Registration Ordinance of 1866 required Chinese households and Chinese servants working for Europeans to register.  +
Ordinance 14 of 1870 required all Chinese in Victoria to carry lanterns after dark.  +
The Regulation of Chinese Ordinance of 1888 forbade Chinese to hold public meetings, except for religious ceremonies and festivals, without a permit from the governor.  +
The European District Preservation Ordinance of 1888 reserved part of the main town for European-style houses.  +
Although Governor John Hennessy once called these ordinances “a monstrous piece of class legislation,” many colonial officials justified these measures on the grounds that most Chinese in Hong Kong had come there on their own accord and could leave if they wanted to.  +
Yet even this justification was flawed, for the colonial government made no attempt to differentiate between the Chinese who had lived in Hong Kong before the British occupation and the newcomers or between the Chinese who indicated their desire to stay in Hong Kong for the long-term and the sojourners who left their families in China.
尽管1857年法令中的大多数歧视性措施在1858年被废除，但随后又出台了一系列新的法令。1866年的《维多利亚登记法令》要求华人家庭和为欧洲人工作的华人佣人进行登记。1870年的第14号法令要求维多利亚所有华人天黑后必须携带灯笼。1888年的《华人规管法令》禁止华人未经总督许可举行公共集会，宗教仪式和节日除外。1888年的《欧洲人聚居区保护法令》将主要城区的一部分划为欧式房屋用地。尽管总督约翰·亨尼西曾称这些法令是“骇人听闻的阶级立法”，但许多殖民官员辩称，香港的大多数华人都是自愿来到香港的，他们如果想离开也可以。然而，即使是这种理由也有缺陷，因为殖民政府没有试图区分在英国占领之前就居住在香港的中国人与新来者，也没有试图区分表示希望长期留在香港的中国人与把家人留在中国的短期居民。 +
Managing the Chinese  管理中国人
Although much of the colonial government’s legal apparatus was dedicated to controlling the Chinese community, the government made little effort to understand its Chinese subjects, their society, or their customs.  +
Whereas in India learning local languages and cultures was considered essential for controlling Britain’s “Jewel in the Crown,” most British officials in China and Hong Kong did not share this concern.  +
There were, of course, exceptions.  +
Before coming to Hong Kong as governor, Davis had been one of the few East India Company officials to study Chinese.  +
Thomas Wade, a linguist and diplomat who served in Hong Kong as assistant “Chinese” secretary to the superintendent of trade, later became professor of Chinese at the University of Cambridge.  +
Samuel Fearon, the colony’s first registrar general, became professor of Chinese at King’s College, London.  +
But such people were rare in early Hong Kong.  +
Shortly after his arrival in Hong Kong in 1859, some twenty years after the British first occupied the island, Governor Hercules Robinson complained that not a single senior colonial officer in his new administration could read or write Chinese.
尽管殖民政府的大部分法律机构都致力于控制华人社群，但政府却很少努力去了解其华人臣民、他们的社会和习俗。在印度，学习当地语言和文化被视为控制英国“皇冠上的明珠”的关键，但大多数在中国大陆和香港的英国官员却并不认同这种观点。当然，也有例外。戴维斯在担任香港总督之前，是少数几位学习过中文的东印度公司官员之一。曾任香港贸易总监助理“中文”秘书的语言学家兼外交官托马斯·韦德，后来成为剑桥大学的中文教授。殖民地首任注册总长塞缪尔·费伦也成为了伦敦国王学院的中文教授。但在早期的香港，这样的人才寥寥无几。 1859 年，在英国首次占领香港约 20 年后，总督赫拉克勒斯·罗宾逊抵达香港不久，便抱怨说，他新政府中没有一个高级殖民官员会读或写中文。 +
Nor did the early Hong Kong government make any serious attempt to incorporate Chinese opinion.  +
Until the first Chinese was appointed to the Legislative Council in 1880, the only person in charge of the Chinese community’s welfare was the registrar general, a Chinese-speaking European originally appointed by Governor Davis in 1844.  +
Instead, until the 1880s the colonial government relied on a tiny handful of European linguists, often with very poor results.  +
One particularly intriguing and colorful of these so-called China experts was Registrar General Daniel Caldwell, who was married to a Chinese woman.  +
Another was Karl Gutzlaff, a Lutheran missionary who also served as an interpreter for opium traders in exchange for using their boats to spread Christian scriptures.  +
But the colonial government’s narrow reliance on these China experts and on interpreters and intermediaries in general often created a barrier between the government and its subjects that could cause serious problems.  +
Caldwell, who accepted bribes and was suspected of running brothels and associating with pirates, did not speak the Hakka dialect spoken by many of Hong Kong’s Chinese residents.  +
Gutzlaff’s weak command of Chinese led him to mistranslate government proclamations, sometimes resulting in violent, even fatal, altercations between the colonial government and the Chinese community.
早期的香港政府也从未认真尝试吸纳华人意见。直到1880年首位华人议员进入立法会之前，唯一负责华人社区福利的人是登记总署署长，一位会说中文的欧洲人，最初由戴维斯总督于1844年任命。在此之前，直到19世纪80年代，殖民政府都依赖极少数欧洲语言学家，但效果往往不尽如人意。这些所谓的“中国专家”中，有一位颇为引人注目且颇具传奇色彩的人物，那就是登记总署署长丹尼尔·考德威尔，他娶了一位华人女子为妻。另一位是卡尔·古茨拉夫，一位路德教传教士，他同时也是鸦片商人的翻译，以此换取利用他们的船只传播基督教教义。然而，殖民政府对这些“中国专家”以及其他翻译和中间人的过度依赖，常常在政府与其臣民之间筑起一道屏障，从而引发严重的问题。卡德威尔收受贿赂，并被怀疑经营妓院和与海盗勾结，他不会说香港许多华人居民所说的客家话。古兹拉夫的中文水平有限，导致他翻译政府公告时出现错误，有时甚至引发殖民政府与华人社区之间的暴力冲突，造成人员伤亡。 +
Although some colonial officials believed that the Chinese were best governed by their own “natural leaders,” the colonial government had to avoid incurring the resentment of the European community by giving too much power to the Chinese elite.  +
In 1844, Governor Davis introduced an ordinance giving the governor the power to appoint “native Chinese Peace Officers.” When in 1853 Governor George Bonham expanded the system by giving the peace officers the right to settle civil disputes and by making the Chinese community pay for the peace officers, a group of British residents argued that such attempts had failed in India and were even less likely to succeed in Hong Kong: “There are no more corrupt people upon earth than the Chinese, and from the Emperor on the throne to the beggar on the dung-hill, there is not a Chinese who is not prepared to lie and support his lie with an oath.” When Bowring proposed a bill in 1856 allowing Chinese to practice law, a European member of the Legislative Council objected, arguing that the Chinese “are a peculiar race of people, and ...  +
are generally crafty, corrupt, mendacious, and deficient in those qualifications which are needed in a trustworthy legal adviser.”15 Nevertheless, in 1857 the British government allowed Chinese to qualify as lawyers, and in 1858 Bowring introduced an ordinance allowing Chinese to serve on juries and for Chinese-style wills to be valid in court.  +
Partly because of opposition from the European community and partly because the government decided to improve its relationship with the emerging Chinese merchant class, the peace officer schemes were abolished in 1861.
尽管一些殖民官员认为，由华人自己的“天然领袖”来治理才是最佳选择，但殖民政府必须避免因赋予华人精英过多权力而激怒欧洲社会。1844 年，戴维斯总督颁布法令，赋予总督任命“本地华人治安官”的权力。1853 年，乔治·邦汉总督进一步扩大了这一制度，赋予治安官解决民事纠纷的权力，并要求华人社区支付治安官的费用。对此，一些英国居民指出，此类尝试在印度已经失败，在香港更不可能成功：“世上没有比华人更腐败的人了，从皇位上的皇帝到粪堆上的乞丐，没有一个华人不准备撒谎，并且会用誓言来支持自己的谎言。” 1856 年，鲍林提出一项法案，允许华人从事律师职业。一位欧洲裔立法会议员对此表示反对，认为华人“是一个特殊的民族，……通常狡猾、腐败、说谎，缺乏一名值得信赖的法律顾问所需的素质。” 15 然而，1857 年，英国政府允许华人取得律师资格。1858 年，鲍林又提出一项法令，允许华人担任陪审员，并承认中式遗嘱在法庭上的有效性。由于部分原因是来自欧洲社会的反对，部分原因是政府决定改善与新兴华人商人阶层的关系，治安官制度于 1861 年被废除。 +
A larger obstacle to giving the Chinese a greater role in managing themselves was the colonial government’s contradictory policy.  +
To ensure that the local Chinese understood government policy, Robinson, Bowring’s successor, ordered a Chinese edition of the Government Gazette.  +
Yet Robinson made practically no effort to enlist the help of the Chinese elite.  +
Although he frequently talked about the importance of the Chinese in making Hong Kong a successful port, he was also convinced that the Chinese community consisted mainly of criminals.  +
He devised registration plans for Chinese who would be more likely to come into contact with Europeans and their property.  +
To protect European property transported in Chinese cargo boats, in 1860 he introduced an ordinance requiring boat owners and their crews to purchase licenses and giving the police wide powers to search cargo boats without warrants.  +
In 1863 he introduced measures for regulating sedan chairs and carriers.  +
Robinson was the first governor not to receive a formal farewell from the Chinese community when he left in 1865.
让华人更多地参与自治的一大障碍是殖民政府自相矛盾的政策。为了确保本地华人理解政府政策，鲍林的继任者罗宾逊下令出版中文版的《 政府公报》。 然而，罗宾逊几乎没有努力争取华人精英的支持。尽管他经常谈到华人对香港港口繁荣发展的重要性，但他同时也坚信华人社区主要由罪犯组成。他制定了针对华人及其财产的登记制度，要求那些更有可能接触到欧洲人及其财产的华人进行登记。为了保护由华人货船运输的欧洲财产，他在 1860 年颁布了一项法令，要求船主及其船员购买许可证，并赋予警方广泛的权力，无需搜查令即可搜查货船。1863 年，他又出台了管理轿子和轿夫的措施。1865 年离任时，罗宾逊是第一位没有得到华人社区正式欢送的总督。 +
No governor tried to control the Chinese population as vigorously as Robinson’s successor, MacDonnell, who came to Hong Kong with almost twenty years’ experience as colonial governor in the British Empire.  +
Although he claimed to have lowered the crime rate and reduced the number of prisoners in Hong Kong, he did so by expanding the power of the police, strengthening curfews, and increasing the use of flogging, hanging, and deportation—not only for convicted criminals, but also for beggars, lepers, and “dangerous” or “suspicious” characters.  +
In 1866, MacDonnell introduced a solution for relieving Hog Kong’s overcrowded jails: prisoners would volunteer to be branded or tattooed and deported, on the condition that they would be flogged and reimprisoned if they ever returned to Hong Kong.
没有哪位总督像罗宾逊的继任者麦唐奈那样大力控制香港华人。麦唐奈到任香港前，已在英国殖民地担任总督近二十年。尽管他声称降低了香港的犯罪率和囚犯人数，但实际上却是通过扩大警察权力、加强宵禁以及增加鞭笞、绞刑和驱逐出境等刑罚来实现的——这些刑罚不仅针对罪犯，也针对乞丐、麻风病人以及“危险”或“可疑”人物。1866年，麦唐奈提出了一项缓解香港监狱人满为患的方案：囚犯自愿接受烙印或纹身并被驱逐出境，条件是如果他们胆敢返回香港，将被鞭笞并重新监禁。 +
Even more convinced than Robinson that Europeans and Chinese should not be treated equally under the law, MacDonnell introduced a wider registration program for managing the Chinese population.  +
In 1866, he tried to control all Chinese boats entering and leaving the harbor.  +
MacDonnell’s most controversial reform was his short-lived plan to end police corruption by regulating gambling through licensing.  +
Almost all of MacDonnell’s measures led to opposition from the Chinese community of Hong Kong, with mixed results.  +
Some Chinese simply left Hong Kong after the 1866 registration ordinance, while others resisted other ordinances by not paying for the new licenses, but this opposition generally had little effect on government policy.  +
Chinese elites did, however, succeed in forcing MacDonnell to end his scheme for regulating gambling.  +
In 1871 they argued in a petition that the system had increased corruption, bankruptcy, robbery, suicide, and the selling of children into slavery.
麦克唐奈比罗宾逊更加坚信欧洲人和中国人不应在法律面前享有同等待遇，因此他推行了一项范围更广的华人登记制度来管理华人人口。1866年，他试图控制所有进出港口的中国船只。麦克唐奈最具争议的改革是他短暂推行的通过发放许可证来规范赌博以根除警察腐败的计划。麦克唐奈的几乎所有措施都遭到了香港华人社区的反对，但结果却喜忧参半。一些华人在1866年登记条例颁布后直接离开了香港，而另一些人则通过拒缴新许可证费用来抵制其他条例，但这种反对总体上对政府政策影响甚微。然而，华人精英最终成功迫使麦克唐奈放弃了其赌博管制计划。1871年，他们在请愿书中指出，该制度加剧了腐败、破产、抢劫、自杀以及贩卖儿童为奴等现象。 +
Like his predecessors, Hennessy, MacDonnell’s successor, used a broad definition of crime and high rates of prosecution to control the Chinese population.  +
However, convinced that MacDonnell’s programs had been inhumane and a violation of British justice, Hennessy tried to abolish flogging as well as branding and tattooing.  +
Trying to modernize the penal system along contemporary British lines, he introduced longer prison terms instead of branding and deportation.  +
While some Chinese elites also opposed Hennessy’s reforms, the Chinese community generally supported them.  +
Hennessy eventually had his way, and both branding and flogging practices were abolished by the Colonial Office in 1880 (although Hennessy’s successor, George Bowen, approved the flogging of prisoners as young as twelve and for very minor offenses).
与前任一样，麦克唐奈的继任者亨尼西也采用宽泛的犯罪定义和高检控率来控制华人人口。然而，亨尼西认为麦克唐奈的政策不人道，违反了英国的司法原则，因此试图废除鞭刑、烙印和纹身。为了使刑罚制度现代化，使其更符合当时的英国模式，他以更长的刑期取代了烙印和驱逐。虽然一些华人精英也反对亨尼西的改革，但华人社区普遍支持这些改革。亨尼西最终如愿以偿，殖民地事务部于1880年废除了烙印和鞭刑（尽管亨尼西的继任者乔治·鲍文批准对年仅十二岁的囚犯以及轻微罪行处以鞭刑）。 +
Having been favorably impressed by the Chinese in Labuan when he was governor there, Hennessy was also the first governor to make a serious effort to enlist the help and opinion of Chinese in Hong Kong.  +
It was Hennessy who in 1880 appointed the first Chinese, Ng Choy, to the Legislative Council.  +
Although Ng’s appointment was only temporary, it reflected the increasing influence of the Chinese merchant community, which in 1879 had asked for more representation.  +
The only British-educated Chinese barrister in the colony, Ng was born in Singapore (making him a British subject) and in 1877 became the first Chinese called to the British bar.  +
After his short term expired Ng went to China, where, better known as Wu Tingfang, he became a legal advisor to the Qing government and then the first Chinese minister to the United States.  +
Only after 1883, when Governor Bowen convinced the Colonial Office to let him nominate three unofficial Legislative Council members, one of whom would be Chinese, was there always a Chinese member on the Legislative Council.  +
Bowen nominated Wong Shing, a journalist and businessman educated at the Morrison Education Society School and in the United States, where he later served in the Chinese legation in Washington.  +
According to Bowen, Wong was “fully qualified to look at Chinese affairs with English eyes and at English affairs with Chinese eyes.”16
亨尼西在担任纳闽总督期间，对当地华人印象深刻，因此他也是首位认真争取香港华人支持和意见的总督。1880 年，正是亨尼西任命吴财为立法会议员，成为首位华人议员。尽管吴财的任命只是暂时的，但这反映了华人商界日益增长的影响力，他们早在 1879 年就要求增加代表权。吴财是当时香港唯一一位在英国接受教育的华人律师，出生于新加坡（因此是英国公民），并于 1877 年成为首位获得英国律师资格的华人。任期结束后，吴财返回中国，化名吴廷芳，先后担任清政府的法律顾问和首位中国驻美公使。直到 1883 年，鲍文总督说服殖民地事务部允许他提名三名非官方的立法委员会成员，其中一人必须是华人之后，立法委员会才始终有华人成员。鲍文提名了黄星，他是一位记者兼商人，曾在莫里森教育协会学校和美国接受教育，后来在美国的中国使馆任职。鲍文认为，黄星“完全有资格用英国人的视角看待中国事务，也能用中国人的视角看待英国事务”。 16 +
Hennessy also tried to reduce racial discrimination and segregation.  +
In 1877 and 1880 he allowed Chinese to buy land in areas previously reserved for Europeans.  +
In 1880 he helped local Chinese leaders end the discriminatory policy of the City Hall museum and library, where Chinese were allowed only at certain times.  +
Hennessy’s liberal ideas about racial equality had already alienated the British community of Barbados, where he had been governor.  +
In Hong Kong, the European community blamed his “pro-Chinese” policies for increased crime and even for the alleged lack of discipline and respect for Europeans among the Chinese population.  +
He was so disliked by the European community that when he left the colony in early 1882, no members of the British business community went to the pier for the traditional farewell ceremony.  +
Leading members of the Chinese community, however, came to bid the governor farewell, presenting him with gifts and embroidered silk banners.
亨尼西也曾努力减少种族歧视和隔离。1877年和1880年，他允许华人购买此前专供欧洲人居住的土地。1880年，他帮助当地华人领袖终止了市政厅博物馆和图书馆的歧视性政策，此前华人只能在特定时间进入。亨尼西关于种族平等的自由主义思想早已疏远了他曾任总督的巴巴多斯的英国社群。在香港，欧洲社群将犯罪率上升，甚至华人缺乏纪律和对欧洲人的尊重归咎于他的“亲华”政策。他如此不受欧洲社群待见，以至于1882年初他离开香港时，没有一位英国商界人士前往码头参加传统的送别仪式。然而，华人社群的领袖们却前来向总督告别，并向他赠送了礼物和绣花丝绸旗帜。 +
TECHNIQUES OF CONTROL?  控制技术？
Scholars who study how colonial governments managed their subjects generally focus nowadays more on the cultural aspects of colonialism than on its political or economic aspects.  +
For example, they often see colonial education as a potent tool for making students useful in the new colonial hierarchy, producing subordinate citizens, and separating colonizers from colonized while creating a proper colonial elite.  +
Similarly, enforcing Western ideals of gender relations helped European colonialists control their subjects.  +
In India, for example, the British introduced a minimum age for marriage and, against Hindu custom, urged widows to remarry.  +
In 1829 they outlawed suttee, the custom whereby a Hindu widow is willingly cremated on the funeral pyre with her deceased husband as an act of devotion.  +
Although many Indians supported the attempts to end the practice, some scholars have seen outlawing suttee as a way for the British to show their own moral superiority and to justify colonialism.  +
In China, efforts by European women to end the traditional practice of foot binding helped legitimize the semicolonial Western presence there.
如今，研究殖民政府如何管理其臣民的学者通常更关注殖民主义的文化层面，而非其政治或经济层面。例如，他们常常将殖民教育视为一种强有力的工具，旨在使学生在新殖民等级制度中发挥作用，培养顺从的公民，并在建立殖民精英的同时，将殖民者与被殖民者区分开来。同样，推行西方性别关系理念也帮助欧洲殖民者控制其臣民。例如，在印度，英国人规定了最低结婚年龄，并违背印度教习俗，敦促寡妇再婚。1829 年，他们取缔了殉葬（suttee）习俗，即印度教寡妇自愿与亡夫一同火化，以此表达对亡夫的虔诚。尽管许多印度人支持废除殉葬的做法，但一些学者认为，取缔殉葬是英国人彰显自身道德优越感并为殖民主义辩护的一种手段。在中国，欧洲女性为结束缠足这一传统习俗所做的努力，有助于使西方在华半殖民统治合法化。 +
Colonial Education  殖民教育
As in other colonies, in Hong Kong neither the intent nor the result of these cultural projects was ever so clear-cut.  +
For example, although colonial education was designed to train compliant subjects and to help further Sino-British commercial and diplomatic relations, it was shaped by several factors: political conditions and educational developments in China and Britain, Britain’s changing relations with China, and conditions in Hong Kong, including the “social composition and attitude of the local Chinese community.”17
与其他殖民地一样，在香港，这些文化项目的意图和结果都并非那么清晰明确。例如，尽管殖民地教育旨在培养顺从的臣民，并促进中英经贸和外交关系，但它受到多种因素的影响：中国和英国的政治状况和教育发展、英国与中国关系的变化，以及香港的现状，包括“当地华人社区的社会构成和态度”。 17 +
The first schools in colonial Hong Kong were private Chinese schools and those run by Christian missionary organizations, such as the Morrison Education Society School (named after Robert Morrison, the first Protestant missionary to China), which moved to Hong Kong from Macau in 1842, and the London Missionary Society’s Anglo-Chinese College, which came from Malacca in 1843.  +
In 1847, in accordance with similar programs in Britain, the British government allowed the colonial government to provide a limited grant to several Chinese village schools.  +
Although funding Chinese education in Hong Kong represented a break from British colonial policy (in India, the Orientalists, who believed that Western knowledge and values could be spread through Indian languages, lost out to the Anglicists, who were convinced that the government should support only English), from 1850 to 1859 the number of Chinese village schools in Hong Kong increased, while the number of Anglo-Chinese missionary schools decreased.
殖民地时期香港最早的学校是私立华文学校和基督教传教机构开办的学校，例如1842年从澳门迁至香港的摩立生教育会学校（以首位赴华新教传教士罗伯特·摩立生的名字命名），以及1843年从马六甲迁至香港的伦敦传教会英华书院。1847年，效仿英国的类似政策，英国政府允许殖民地政府向一些华人乡村学校提供有限的资助。尽管资助香港的华文教育标志着英国殖民政策的突破（在印度，东方学家认为西方知识和价值观可以通过印度语言传播，但最终败给了坚持政府只支持英语的英国学者），但从1850年到1859年，香港华人乡村学校的数量有所增加，而英华传教士学校的数量则有所减少。 +
Although Christian churches continued to play an important role in Hong Kong’s education system, the government, with the guidance of James Legge, began to take a more active role in education and to stress the teaching of English.  +
(Although he was a missionary, Legge opposed church control of education and compulsory religious education.  +
He also admired Confucianism and saw no need to replace it with Christianity.) This shift was partly shaped by changing attitudes toward education in Britain, where church control of education had fallen out of favor, and by colonial officials’ conviction that teaching English would help improve Sino-British relations.  +
But the shift also reflected the attitudes and demand of a rising Chinese middle class, which increasingly called for English education.  +
The government Central School for boys, founded in 1862, quickly became far more popular with the local Chinese middle class than the village schools.  +
(Wealthier Chinese generally sent their sons to China or hired private tutors; a government school for girls opened in the late 1880s.) Many Chinese boys considered the Central School an avenue to a good job with European firms or the Imperial Chinese Maritime Customs.  +
By the 1870s, graduates were acquiring jobs with local trading houses, in the Chinese treaty ports, in Japan, and in the United States.
尽管基督教教会在香港的教育体系中仍然扮演着重要角色，但在詹姆斯·莱格的指导下，政府开始更加积极地介入教育，并强调英语教学。（莱格虽然是一位传教士，但他反对教会控制教育和强制宗教教育。他也推崇儒家思想，认为没有必要用基督教取代儒家。）这一转变部分源于英国教育观念的转变——在英国，教会控制教育的做法已不再流行；部分源于殖民官员认为教授英语有助于改善中英关系。但这一转变也反映了日益壮大的中国中产阶级的态度和需求，他们越来越需要接受英语教育。政府于1862年创办的中央男校很快便比乡村学校更受当地中国中产阶级的欢迎。 （富裕的中国人通常会将儿子送回中国留学或聘请私人教师；一所女子公立学校于19世纪80年代末开办。）许多中国男孩将中央学校视为进入欧洲公司或清政府海关获得一份好工作的途径。到了19世纪70年代，毕业生们已经在当地商行、中国通商口岸、日本和美国找到了工作。 +
Central School graduates soon became some of the most successful businessmen in the colony, many making their fortunes as compradors to foreign firms or by starting their own businesses.  +
The best known of these graduates were the Eurasian Ho brothers.  +
Robert Ho Tung, who entered the school in 1873, became an internationally known tycoon.  +
At age seventeen he joined the Imperial Chinese Maritime Customs but resigned in 1880 to become comprador of Jardine and Matheson.  +
He was considered to be the wealthiest man in Hong Kong and was associated with practically every large business in the colony.  +
Ho Tung was a renowned philanthropist, both in Hong Kong and in China.  +
His brother Ho Kam Tong was Jardine and Matheson’s assistant comprador, a successful businessman on his own, and a Tung Wah Hospital Committee member.  +
Even more so than his brother, Ho Kam Tong was known in Hong Kong and China for his public service and philanthropy.  +
Another brother, Ho Fook, graduated from the Central School in 1881, later succeeding Robert as head comprador of Jardine and Matheson.
中央学校的毕业生很快成为殖民地最成功的商人，许多人通过为外国公司担任买办或自主创业而发家致富。其中最著名的当属欧亚混血的何氏兄弟。何东于1873年入学，后来成为国际知名的商业巨头。他17岁时加入清朝海关，但于1880年辞职，成为怡和洋行的买办。他被认为是香港首富，几乎与殖民地所有的大型企业都有联系。何东是香港和中国著名的慈善家。他的弟弟何锦堂是怡和洋行的助理买办，也是一位成功的商人，同时还是东华医院委员会的成员。何锦堂比他的哥哥更以其对公共服务和慈善事业而闻名于香港和中国。另一个兄弟何福于 1881 年从中央学校毕业，后来接替罗伯特成为怡和集团的总买办。 +

Policing Prostitution and Contagious Diseases
打击卖淫和传染病
The regulation and licensing of prostitution in Hong Kong has often been seen as another form of control—as a way for the government to intervene in the lives of its colonial subjects, especially Chinese women, and as an example of how the colonial government could choose which local laws and customs to keep or abolish.  +
As with education, here too the situation was considerably more complicated.  +
The colonial government did not always have such a free hand.  +
It had to answer to the Colonial Office and the British Parliament, and it was often bound to comply with legislation in other parts of the empire.  +
Nor could it afford to offend the Chinese community.  +
The colonial government also often had help from Chinese elites who, for example, especially supported the licensing and regulation of prostitution to keep brothels from infiltrating into respectable parts of town.
香港对卖淫活动的监管和许可制度常被视为另一种形式的控制——政府借此干预殖民地臣民（尤其是中国女性）的生活，也以此为例，说明殖民政府如何选择保留或废除哪些地方法律和习俗。与教育一样，这方面的情况也更为复杂。殖民政府并非总能如此自由行事。它必须对殖民地事务部和英国议会负责，而且常常不得不遵守帝国其他地区的法律。它也不能冒犯华人社群。殖民政府也常常得到华人精英的支持，例如，他们尤其支持对卖淫活动进行许可和监管，以防止妓院渗透到体面的城区。 +
Brothels and venereal disease were part of the colony’s history from the start.  +
Because the overwhelming majority of Chinese and Europeans who came after the British occupation were men, Hong Kong’s gender balance was always heavily skewed.  +
The large military presence made the situation even worse.  +
Although the influx of Chinese during the Taiping Rebellion brought more women, according to the first proper census in 1872 the ratio of Chinese men to women was seven to one; the ratio for Europeans was five to one.  +
By the 1850s, Hong Kong was known as a center for prostitution and venereal disease, especially syphilis.  +
According to the 1876 census, five-sixths of the almost twenty-five thousand Chinese women in Hong Kong were prostitutes.  +
In 1877 the police magistrate estimated that only one out of every six Chinese women in Hong Kong were either married or concubines, the rest being prostitutes.
妓院和性病自香港殖民地建立之初便如影随形。由于英国占领后涌入的华人和欧洲人绝大多数是男性，香港的性别比例一直严重失衡。庞大的军队驻扎更是雪上加霜。尽管太平天国运动期间大量华人涌入带来了更多女性，但根据1872年首次正式人口普查，华人男女比例为七比一，欧洲人男女比例为五比一。到了19世纪50年代，香港已成为卖淫和性病（尤其是梅毒）的​​重灾区。1876年的人口普查显示，香港近两万五千名华人女性中，有六分之五是妓女。1877年，地方法官估计，香港每六名华人女性中只有一人是已婚或妾室，其余均为妓女。 +
This assumption that Chinese women who were either not married or concubines must necessarily have been prostitutes says more about European attitudes toward the Chinese community than about the actual number of prostitutes.  +
Because Europeans in Hong Kong often considered Chinese women to be sexual and moral hazards, from 1857 to 1890 prostitution was licensed and regulated, with brothels strictly confined to separate areas depending on whether they catered to Western or Chinese clients.  +
Similar to ordinances passed that year in Malta and the Ionian Islands (both British possessions), Hong Kong’s first contagious disease ordinance, passed in 1857, called for the licensing of brothels by the registrar general, compulsory weekly medical inspections of prostitutes, punishment of prostitutes (and the brothel keepers) who transmitted venereal diseases to clients, and the detainment of infected prostitutes in a lock hospital.  +
After the British Parliament passed the Contagious Diseases Acts of 1866 in England and Wales, the 1857 ordinance was replaced in Hong Kong by the Contagious Diseases Ordinance of 1867.  +
The colonial government now had even more power to regulate prostitution, for the new ordinance gave the registrar general and the police superintendent the right to enter suspected brothels without a warrant.  +
This, explains historian Philippa Levine, justified “a greater invasiveness into colonial lives, especially those of Chinese women.”18
这种认为未婚或妾室的中国女性必然是妓女的假设，更多地反映了欧洲人对华人社群的态度，而非妓女的实际数量。由于在港的欧洲人常常将中国女性视为性与道德上的隐患，因此从 1857 年到 1890 年，卖淫活动实行许可和监管，妓院根据服务对象是西方人还是中国人，被严格限制在不同的地段。与同年马耳他和爱奥尼亚群岛（均为英国属地）通过的法令类似，香港于 1857 年通过的第一部传染病条例规定，妓院由登记总署署长颁发许可证，妓女必须接受每周一次的强制性体检，将性病传染给嫖客的妓女（以及妓院经营者）绳之以法，并将感染性病的妓女关押在封闭式医院。英国议会于 1866 年在英格兰和威尔士通过《传染病法》后，香港也以 1867 年《传染病条例》取代了 1857 年的旧条例。殖民政府因此拥有了更大的权力来监管卖淫活动，因为新条例赋予了登记总署署长和警司无需搜查令即可进入疑似妓院的权力。历史学家菲利帕·莱文解释说，这使得“对殖民地人民生活，尤其是对中国妇女的生活，进行更大程度的侵犯成为可能”。 18 +
Colonial officials claimed that these ordinances saved girls and women from brothel slavery and from being exploited by brothel owners and kept prostitution from spreading into the respectable parts of town.  +
However, the ordinances were designed mainly to protect soldiers, sailors, and policemen from venereal diseases by maintaining a supply of disease-free Chinese women.  +
Only prostitutes who serviced Westerners had to be inspected, while in practice only the prostitutes servicing European police and soldiers were regulated.  +
In December 1880, Governor Hennessy explained to the secretary for the colonies that the “real purpose of the brothel legislation” in Hong Kong had not been the protection of prostitutes but rather “the provision of clean Chinese women for the use of the British soldiers and the sailors of the Royal Navy in this Colony.” Here the legislation had been successful.  +
However, “far from checking this odious species of slavery,” the ordinances had “undoubtedly intensified it.”19 In June 1881, Hennessy explained how “women are bought and sold in nearly every brothel in the place.”20 Although the Colonial Office did not support Hennessy’s plans to overhaul the ordinances, it approved minor amendments to them.
殖民官员声称，这些法令使女孩和妇女免于沦为妓院奴隶，免遭妓院老板的剥削，并阻止卖淫蔓延到城镇的体面区域。然而，这些法令的主要目的是通过维持无病中国女性的供应，来保护士兵、水手和警察免受性病的侵害。只有为西方人服务的妓女才需要接受检查，而实际上，只有为欧洲警察和士兵服务的妓女才受到监管。1880 年 12 月，总督轩尼诗向殖民地事务大臣解释说，香港“妓院立法的真正目的”并非保护妓女，而是“为本殖民地的英国士兵和皇家海军水手提供干净的中国女性”。在这一方面，立法取得了成功。然而，这些法令“非但没有遏制这种可憎的奴役形式”，反而“无疑加剧了这种现象”。 19 1881 年 6 月，亨尼西解释说，“当地几乎每家妓院都存在买卖妇女的情况。” 20 虽然殖民地事务部不支持亨尼西对法令进行全面改革的计划，但它批准了一些小的修改。 +
When the Colonial Office ordered colonial governments to end their contagious diseases laws after the British Parliament repealed the Contagious Diseases Acts in 1886, Governor William Des Voeux tried desperately to maintain the status quo.  +
Des Voeux argued that the colony’s security depended on the health of its soldiers and police and that the system was the only way to keep girls from being sold into prostitution, check the spread of venereal diseases, and keep brothels from spreading into the more respectable parts of town.  +
Finally, in 1889, the Legislative Council passed the Women and Girl’s Protection Ordinance, which repealed the Contagious Diseases Ordinance of 1867 but then reinstated almost all of the provisions for licensing and registering brothels.  +
Although this ordinance was repealed in 1890 because it violated the orders of the secretary for the colonies, its repeal seems to have had little effect because the same prostitutes who had heeded or ignored the earlier laws continued to do the same.
1886年，英国议会废除了《传染病法》，殖民地事务部随即命令各殖民地政府终止其传染病相关法律。当时的殖民地总督威廉·德·沃竭力维持现状。德·沃辩称，殖民地的安全取决于士兵和警察的健康，而这套制度是防止女孩被贩卖为妓女、遏制性病传播以及防止妓院蔓延至城镇较为体面区域的唯一途径。最终，在1889年，立法委员会通过了《妇女和女孩保护条例》，该条例废除了1867年的《传染病条例》，但几乎恢复了所有关于妓院许可和登记的规定。虽然这项法令因违反殖民地事务大臣的命令而在 1890 年被废除，但废除该法令似乎并没有产生多大影响，因为那些曾经遵守或无视先前法律的妓女们继续做着同样的事情。 +
While it did little to prevent brothel slavery or the exploitation of prostitutes, the licensing and regulation of prostitution met its main goal of helping to prevent the transmission of venereal diseases among soldiers and sailors and keeping brothels from spreading into more respectable areas of town (which appears to have been the main concern of the Chinese elite).  +
In 1893, however, fiery speeches in Parliament and pressure from groups in Britain forced the colonial government to stop all registration and inspection schemes.  +
Unlike in 1890, this time the change was dramatic.  +
Prostitutes stopped going for their medical inspections, new brothels opened in areas where they had not been before, and by 1897 about half of the soldiers in Hong Kong were being treated for venereal diseases (compared to about 15 percent a decade earlier).
尽管卖淫许可证制度对阻止妓院奴役或剥削妓女收效甚微，但它确实达到了其主要目标，即帮助防止性病在士兵和水手之间传播，并阻止妓院蔓延到城里更体面的地区（这似乎是中国精英阶层的主要担忧）。然而，1893年，议会中激烈的演讲以及来自英国各团体的压力迫使殖民政府停止了所有登记和检查制度。与1890年不同，这一次的变化是剧烈的。妓女不再接受体检，新的妓院在以前从未涉足的地区开业，到1897年，香港约有一半的士兵正在接受性病治疗（而十年前这一比例约为15%）。 +
What do we know about the prostitutes themselves? Many of the Chinese prostitutes were either kidnapped and sold into prostitution or sold by their impoverished parents.  +
Contemporary reports mention how young girls in Hong Kong often disguised themselves as boys in public to avoid being kidnapped.  +
Other prostitutes came from the already well-developed sex trades in Canton and Macau.  +
Most of the European prostitutes had been prostitutes before they came to Hong Kong, but some resorted to prostitution after falling on hard times.  +
Toward the end of the nineteenth century, among the European prostitutes were a large number of Jews who had fled the pogroms in Russia.  +
Shunned by other European women, these prostitutes lived mainly on the margins of the European parts of town or in the predominantly Chinese sections such as Wanchai.  +
The life of European prostitutes was not always one of humiliation and despair, however, for some rose high enough in society to retire comfortably in Europe or America.
我们对妓女本身了解多少？许多中国妓女要么是被绑架贩卖，要么是被贫困的父母卖掉。当时的记载提到，香港的年轻女孩经常女扮男装，以避免被绑架。其他妓女则来自广州和澳门，那里的性交易已经相当成熟。大多数欧洲妓女在来香港之前就已经是妓女，但也有一些人是因为生活困顿而被迫卖淫。十九世纪末，欧洲妓女中有很多是逃离俄罗斯大屠杀的犹太人。由于被其他欧洲女性排斥，这些妓女主要生活在欧洲人聚居区的边缘地带，或者像湾仔这样的华人聚居区。然而，欧洲妓女的生活并非总是充满屈辱和绝望，因为有些人最终在社会上取得了相当的地位，得以在欧洲或美国安享晚年。 +
In a group of their own were so-called protected women—Chinese women who served as mistresses to European men, especially before European women came in larger numbers later in the nineteenth century.  +
Many of these women were Tankas, some having been purchased by their European masters from brothels in Canton and Hong Kong.  +
Known to the Chinese as saltwater maids, these women lived in a marginal area of Hong Kong that was nestled between the European business and residential sections of town and was inhabited by a mixed group of European prostitutes, Indian merchants and shopkeepers, Portuguese, and Chinese prostitutes who serviced European and middle- and upper-class Chinese clients.  +
Although some of these protected women did well for themselves, the status of their protection could be very fragile.  +
Most European men eventually returned home, leaving their Chinese mistresses in Hong Kong, where they were often despised by the mainstream of the Chinese community.  +
The children of these women formed the beginnings of the Eurasian community.
在她们之中，还有一群被称为“受保护女性”的群体——她们是为欧洲男性提供性服务的中国女性，尤其是在 19 世纪后期欧洲女性大量涌入香港之前。这些女性大多是“浪娼”（Tanka），其中一些是被她们的欧洲主人从广州和香港的妓院买来的。这些女性被中国人称为“海女”，她们居住在香港一个边缘地带，夹在欧洲人的商业区和住宅区之间，居住着形形色色的人，包括欧洲妓女、印度商人、店主、葡萄牙人和中国妓女，她们服务于欧洲人和中国中上层阶级的客户。尽管有些受保护女性生活富裕，但她们的保护地位却非常脆弱。大多数欧洲男性最终返回家乡，留下她们的中国情妇在香港，这些情妇往往受到主流华人社区的鄙视。这些女性的后代构成了欧亚混血社区的雏形。 +
Mui-Tsai  梅蔡
Many of the girls and women in Hong Kong were mui-tsai (“little sisters”) who had been sold to wealthier families through an intermediary known as a pocket mother.  +
Found throughout China under a variety of names, this arrangement helped poor families find better homes for their daughters, while providing domestic help for wealthier families.  +
Although Hong Kong’s first ordinance, passed in 1844, banned slavery, neither the colonial government nor the majority of the Chinese population considered this to include the mui-tsai.  +
Despite some sporadic criticism, mainly from missionaries in Hong Kong and officials in Britain, the legal status of the system did not come into question until the late 1870s.
香港许多女孩和妇女都是“ 小妹 ”，她们通过被称为“口袋妈妈”的中间人被卖给富裕家庭。这种制度在中国各地都有，名称各异，它既帮助贫困家庭为女儿找到更好的归宿，又为富裕家庭提供家政服务。尽管香港于 1844 年颁布的第一部法令禁止奴隶制，但殖民政府和大多数中国民众都认为该法令并不包括 “小妹”制度。 尽管偶尔会有一些批评的声音，主要来自香港的传教士和英国官员，但直到 19 世纪 70 年代末，这一制度的合法性才受到质疑。 +

The reason that the mui-tsai issue became so controversial had much to do with timing.  +
By the late 1870s, an extensive network of kidnapping had developed to feed the need for prostitutes and servants in Hong Kong.  +
Girls were kidnapped from their native villages in China and then sold in Hong Kong.  +
With the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, the colony was becoming a popular destination for European and American tourists, many of whom were shocked that such a practice could be tolerated in a British colony.  +
The Victorian traveler Isabella Bird described the mui-tsai system as a “peculiar hateful form of slavery which is recognised by Chinese custom, and which has attained gigantic proportions in Victoria.”21 The issue had also attracted the attention of reformist groups in Britain, such as the Anti-Slavery Society and the Society for the Protection of Aborigines.  +
In California, American politicians used evidence of the mui-tsai to support restricting Chinese immigration to the United States.  +
Furthermore, local Chinese elites had become strong enough to protect a time-honored Chinese custom from which they benefited.  +
In November 1878, four prominent Chinese merchants—including Fung Ming Shan, a founder of the Nam Pak Hong Kung So—petitioned Governor Hennessy for permission to form an agency to stop the kidnapping of children from Dongguan, the four merchants’ native district in Guangdong.
梅妾问题之所以引发如此大的争议，很大程度上与时机有关。到了 19 世纪 70 年代末，为了满足香港对妓女和佣人的需求，一个庞大的绑架网络已经形成。女孩们从中国农村被绑架，然后被贩卖到香港。随着 1869 年苏伊士运河的开通，香港逐渐成为欧美游客的热门目的地，许多游客震惊于这种做法竟然会在英国殖民地被容忍。维多利亚时代的旅行家伊莎贝拉·伯德将梅妾制度描述为“一种奇特的、令人憎恶的奴隶制形式，它被中国习俗所认可，并在维多利亚州达到了惊人的规模。” 21 这个问题也引起了英国改革派团体的关注，例如反奴隶制协会和原住民保护协会。在美国加利福尼亚州，一些政客利用梅妾的证据来支持限制华人移民美国的政策。此外，当地华人精英势力日益强大，足以维护一项他们从中获益的古老习俗。1878 年 11 月，包括南白鸿公社创始人之一冯明山在内的四位华人商人向总督轩尼诗请愿，请求成立一个机构，制止从东莞（这四位商人的故乡）拐卖儿童的现象。 +
In October 1879, Chief Justice John Smale condemned the mui-tsai practice for violating British and Hong Kong laws prohibiting slavery.  +
Smale estimated that between ten thousand and twenty thousand girls were enslaved in Hong Kong.  +
“The more I penetrate below the polished surface of our civilization,” he declared, “the more convinced am I that the broad under-current of life here is more like that in the Southern States of the America when slavery was dominant, than it resembles the all-pervading civilization of England.”22 Smale’s attack caused a stir among the Chinese community, and less than two weeks later a group of Chinese merchants petitioned Governor Hennessy for permission to form an association to protect kidnapped women and children.  +
After reminding Hennessy of Charles Elliot’s proclamation of February 1841 guaranteeing Chinese in Hong Kong the right to practice their traditional customs, the petitioners went to great lengths to explain the difference between kidnapping and the mui-tsai system.  +
They also warned that banning the system would lead even more poor families in Guangdong to practice another traditional Chinese custom: drowning unwanted female babies at birth.
1879 年 10 月，首席大法官约翰·斯梅尔谴责 “梅仔” 制度违反了英国和香港禁止奴隶制的法律。斯梅尔估计，当时香港有 1 万至 2 万名女孩被奴役。他宣称：“我越深入了解我们文明光鲜亮丽的表象之下，就越确信，这里生活的暗流更像是奴隶制盛行时期的美国南部各州，而不是无处不在的英国文明。” 22 斯梅尔的抨击在华人社区引起了轩然大波。不到两周后，一群华人商人向总督轩尼诗请愿，请求成立一个协会，以保护被绑架的妇女儿童。请愿者们提醒轩尼诗，查尔斯·艾略特曾于 1841 年 2 月颁布公告，保障香港华人享有传统习俗的权利。随后，他们竭力解释绑架和 “梅仔” 制度之间的区别。他们还警告说，禁止这种制度会导致广东更多贫困家庭实行另一种中国传统习俗：溺死刚出生的女婴。 +
Many people in Hong Kong felt that Smale had unnecessarily condemned a perfectly acceptable, time-honored Chinese custom.  +
Complicating matters was the ambiguous status of the mui-tsai within the adoptive household—half servant, half family member—with some mui-tsai even eventually becoming concubines and inheriting their husbands’ wealth.  +
And one of the cardinal rules of British colonial administration was that tampering too much with native customs could be risky.  +
But critics considered the system a form of slavery that often encouraged sexual abuse.  +
Defenders, however, insisted that the girls were treated as family members and that the system saved girls from prostitution.
许多香港人认为 ，斯梅尔对一项完全合理且历史悠久的中国习俗进行了不必要的谴责。更复杂的是，梅菜在养父母家中的地位模糊不清——既是仆人，又是家庭成员——有些梅菜甚至最终成为妾室，继承丈夫的财产。英国殖民统治的一条重要原则就是，过度干预当地习俗可能会带来风险。但批评者认为，这种制度是一种奴隶制，常常助长性虐待。然而，支持者则坚称，这些女孩被视为家庭成员，而且这种制度使她们免于沦为娼妓。 +
By asking for permission to form a society to stop kidnapping, the Chinese elites were trying to distinguish between kidnapping and the mui-tsai system, thus attempting to preserve a custom in which they were so heavily invested.  +
Their petition was also a declaration that the Chinese elites had the wherewithal to handle the situation.  +
After a series of studies on whether the system constituted slavery, the matter went to the British House of Lords, which agreed that the colonial government should not interfere with customs that were so deeply ingrained in Chinese society.  +
In 1880 Hennessy approved the Chinese merchants’ plan, and the Po Leung Kuk (Society for the Protection of Women and Children) was officially opened in August 1882.  +
The Colonial Office eventually decided that the only thing necessary was to ensure that the mui-tsai were not being sold into prostitution, passing an ordinance to this effect in 1887.
通过请求成立一个制止拐卖的社团，中国精英试图区分拐卖和嫔妃制度，从而维护他们深耕多年的传统习俗。他们的请愿也表明，中国精英有能力处理此事。在对嫔妃制度是否构成奴隶制进行了一系列研究之后，此事提交至英国上议院。上议院一致认为，殖民政府不应干预根深蒂固于中国社会的习俗。1880 年，亨尼西批准了中国商人的计划，保良局（妇女儿童保护协会）于 1882 年 8 月正式成立。殖民地事务部最终认定，唯一需要做的就是确保嫔妃不被卖入妓院，并于 1887 年颁布了相关法令。 +
Especially compared to the movement to end the mui-tsai system after World War I, the debate in the late 1870s and the early 1880s was short-lived and confined mainly within Hong Kong.  +
Nor did the debate and the subsequent establishment of the Po Leung Kuk lead to any significant changes to the mui-tsai system.  +
Although Hennessy hoped that the Po Leung Kuk would end the practice, some critics considered the society a clever scheme for ensuring that wealthy Chinese families always had a steady supply of young servants and that wealthy Chinese men had a pool of potential concubines.  +
As Elizabeth Sinn argues, the Chinese merchants’ “triumph had long-term consequences.” Despite its many commendable charitable and philanthropic activities, the Po Leung Kuk upheld a “peculiarly Chinese form of patriarchy at a critical point of its development in Hong Kong.” Once the controversy had subsided, “official inertia set in again,” and the mui-tsai system was left “unquestioned” until 1917.23 Sociologist Henry Lethbridge concluded that instead of ending the system, the Po Leung Kuk “helped, indirectly, to maintain in servitude numbers of Chinese girls until long after the First World War.”24
与一战后废除嫔妃制度的运动相比，19 世纪 70 年代末 80 年代初的这场辩论持续时间很短，且主要局限于香港。这场辩论以及随后保良局的成立，也并未对嫔妃制度带来任何实质性的改变。尽管轩尼诗希望保良局能够终结这一陋习，但一些批评人士认为，保良局不过是确保富裕华人家庭始终拥有源源不断的年轻仆人，以及富裕华人男性拥有众多潜在妾室的巧妙手段。正如伊丽莎白·辛恩所言，华人商人的“胜利产生了深远的影响”。尽管保良局开展了许多值得称道的慈善活动，但它在香港发展的关键时期，却维护了一种“独特的中国式父权制”。争议平息后，“官方惯性再次出现”， 女傩制度一直“未受质疑”地延续到 1917 年。 23 社会学家亨利·莱斯布里奇得出结论，保良局非但没有废除这一制度，反而“间接地帮助维持了大量中国女孩的奴役状态，直至第一次世界大战后很长一段时间”。 24 +
