As in other colonies, colonialism in Hong Kong could be repressive and yet offer opportunities.  +
Until the 1860s, when the British presence in China shifted to Shanghai, Hong Kong provided several economic and diplomatic functions for Britain.  +
It was from Hong Kong, which was the British headquarters for the China trade, that the British plenipotentiary and superintendent of trade administered all British subjects in China.  +
(After John Bowring retired in 1859, the office of Hong Kong governor was separated from that of plenipotentiary and superintendent of trade in China.) The colony was a naval station and the first port of call after Singapore for European travelers.  +
Hong Kong also provided the security and the freedom of movement and residence that the treaty ports did not.  +
These functions all meant that Hong Kong offered a variety of opportunities for Chinese to serve as contractors, laborers, servants, clerks, and interpreters.
与其他殖民地一样，香港的殖民统治既充满压迫，也蕴藏机遇。直到19世纪60年代英国在华的势力转移至上海之前，香港为英国提供了诸多经济和外交职能。香港是英国对华贸易的总部，英国全权代表兼贸易总监在此管理所有在华英国臣民。（1859年鲍林退休后，香港总督一职与英国全权代表兼贸易总监的职位分离。）香港曾是海军基地，也是欧洲旅行者在新加坡之后的首选停靠港。此外，香港还提供了条约港口所不具备的安全保障以及行动和居住的自由。所有这些职能都意味着香港为华人提供了各种各样的机会，他们可以担任承包商、劳工、佣人、文员和翻译等职务。 +

尽管殖民政府的大部分法律机构都致力于控制华人社群，但政府却很少努力去了解其华人臣民、他们的社会和习俗。在印度，学习当地语言和文化被视为控制英国“皇冠上的明珠”的关键，但大多数在中国大陆和香港的英国官员却并不认同这种观点。当然，也有例外。戴维斯在担任香港总督之前，是少数几位学习过中文的东印度公司官员之一。曾任香港贸易总监助理“中文”秘书的语言学家兼外交官托马斯·韦德，后来成为剑桥大学的中文教授。殖民地首任注册总长塞缪尔·费伦也成为了伦敦国王学院的中文教授。但在早期的香港，这样的人才寥寥无几。 1859 年，在英国首次占领香港约 20 年后，总督赫拉克勒斯·罗宾逊抵达香港不久，便抱怨说，他新政府中没有一个高级殖民官员会读或写中文。 +

Nor did the early Hong Kong government make any serious attempt to incorporate 吸收；使并入；纳入 Chinese opinion.  +

Gutzlaff’s weak command of Chinese led him to mistranslate government proclamations, sometimes resulting in violent, even fatal, altercations between the colonial government and the Chinese community.
早期的香港政府也从未认真尝试吸纳华人意见。直到1880年首位华人议员进入立法会之前，唯一负责华人社区福利的人是登记总署署长，一位会说中文的欧洲人，最初由戴维斯总督于1844年任命。在此之前，直到19世纪80年代，殖民政府都依赖极少数欧洲语言学家，但效果往往不尽如人意。这些所谓的“中国专家”中，有一位颇为引人注目且颇具传奇色彩的人物，那就是登记总署署长丹尼尔·考德威尔，他娶了一位华人女子为妻。另一位是卡尔·古茨拉夫，一位路德教传教士，他同时也是鸦片商人的翻译，以此换取利用他们的船只传播基督教教义。然而，殖民政府对这些“中国专家”以及其他翻译和中间人的过度依赖，常常在政府与其臣民之间筑起一道屏障，从而引发严重的问题。卡德威尔收受贿赂，并被怀疑经营妓院和与海盗勾结，他不会说香港许多华人居民所说的客家话。古兹拉夫的中文水平有限，导致他翻译政府公告时出现错误，有时甚至引发殖民政府与华人社区之间的暴力冲突，造成人员伤亡。 +

Although some colonial 殖民的 officials 官员 believed that the Chinese were best governed by their own “natural leaders,” the colonial government had to avoid incurring 招致；引起 the resentment 愤恨；怨恨 of the European community by giving too much power to the Chinese elite 精英；上层人士. +
In 1844, Governor 总督 Davis introduced an ordinance 法令；条例 giving the governor the power to appoint 任命；委派 “native Chinese Peace Officers.” When in 1853 Governor George Bonham expanded 扩大；扩展 the system by giving the peace officers the right to settle 解决；处理 civil 民事的 disputes 争端；纠纷 and by making the Chinese community pay for the peace officers, a group of British residents argued that such attempts 尝试；企图 had failed in India and were even less likely to succeed in Hong Kong: “There are no more corrupt 腐败的；贪污的 people upon earth than the Chinese, and from the Emperor 皇帝 on the throne 王座；君主地位 to the beggar 乞丐 on the dung-hill, there is not a Chinese who is not prepared to lie and support his lie with an oath 誓言；宣誓.” When Bowring proposed 提议；提出 a bill 法案；议案 in 1856 allowing Chinese to practice 从事；执业 law, a European member of the Legislative 立法的 Council 委员会；理事会 objected 反对；不赞成, arguing that the Chinese “are a peculiar 独特的；怪异的 race 种族 of people, and ... +
are generally crafty 狡猾的；狡诈的, corrupt, mendacious 撒谎的；不诚实的, and deficient 缺乏的；不足的 in those qualifications 资格；条件 which are needed in a trustworthy 可靠的；值得信赖的 legal 法律的 adviser 顾问.”15 Nevertheless 然而；尽管如此, in 1857 the British government allowed Chinese to qualify 取得资格；合格 as lawyers, and in 1858 Bowring introduced an ordinance allowing Chinese to serve 担任；服务 on juries 陪审团 and for Chinese-style wills 遗嘱 to be valid 有效的；合法的 in court. +
Partly because of opposition 反对；反抗 from the European community and partly because the government decided to improve its relationship with the emerging 新兴的；崭露头角的 Chinese merchant 商人；批发商 class, the peace officer schemes 计划；方案 were abolished 废除；废止 in 1861.

are generally crafty, corrupt, mendacious, and deficient in those qualifications which are needed in a trustworthy legal adviser.”15 Nevertheless, in 1857 the British government allowed Chinese to qualify as lawyers, and in 1858 Bowring introduced an ordinance allowing Chinese to serve on juries and for Chinese-style wills to be valid in court.  +
Partly because of opposition from the European community and partly because the government decided to improve its relationship with the emerging Chinese merchant class, the peace officer schemes were abolished in 1861.
尽管一些殖民官员认为，由华人自己的“天然领袖”来治理才是最佳选择，但殖民政府必须避免因赋予华人精英过多权力而激怒欧洲社会。1844 年，戴维斯总督颁布法令，赋予总督任命“本地华人治安官”的权力。1853 年，乔治·邦汉总督进一步扩大了这一制度，赋予治安官解决民事纠纷的权力，并要求华人社区支付治安官的费用。对此，一些英国居民指出，此类尝试在印度已经失败，在香港更不可能成功：“世上没有比华人更腐败的人了，从皇位上的皇帝到粪堆上的乞丐，没有一个华人不准备撒谎，并且会用誓言来支持自己的谎言。” 1856 年，鲍林提出一项法案，允许华人从事律师职业。一位欧洲裔立法会议员对此表示反对，认为华人“是一个特殊的民族，……通常狡猾、腐败、说谎，缺乏一名值得信赖的法律顾问所需的素质。” 15 然而，1857 年，英国政府允许华人取得律师资格。1858 年，鲍林又提出一项法令，允许华人担任陪审员，并承认中式遗嘱在法庭上的有效性。由于部分原因是来自欧洲社会的反对，部分原因是政府决定改善与新兴华人商人阶层的关系，治安官制度于 1861 年被废除。 +

In 1863 he introduced measures 措施；办法 for regulating 管理；控制 sedan chairs 轿子 and carriers 搬运工.  +

Robinson was the first governor not to receive a formal farewell from the Chinese community when he left in 1865.
让华人更多地参与自治的一大障碍是殖民政府自相矛盾的政策。为了确保本地华人理解政府政策，鲍林的继任者罗宾逊下令出版中文版的《 政府公报》。 然而，罗宾逊几乎没有努力争取华人精英的支持。尽管他经常谈到华人对香港港口繁荣发展的重要性，但他同时也坚信华人社区主要由罪犯组成。他制定了针对华人及其财产的登记制度，要求那些更有可能接触到欧洲人及其财产的华人进行登记。为了保护由华人货船运输的欧洲财产，他在 1860 年颁布了一项法令，要求船主及其船员购买许可证，并赋予警方广泛的权力，无需搜查令即可搜查货船。1863 年，他又出台了管理轿子和轿夫的措施。1865 年离任时，罗宾逊是第一位没有得到华人社区正式欢送的总督。 +

In 1866, MacDonnell introduced a solution for relieving Hog Kong’s overcrowded jails: prisoners would volunteer to be branded or tattooed and deported, on the condition that they would be flogged and reimprisoned if they ever returned to Hong Kong.
没有哪位总督像罗宾逊的继任者麦唐奈那样大力控制香港华人。麦唐奈到任香港前，已在英国殖民地担任总督近二十年。尽管他声称降低了香港的犯罪率和囚犯人数，但实际上却是通过扩大警察权力、加强宵禁以及增加鞭笞、绞刑和驱逐出境等刑罚来实现的——这些刑罚不仅针对罪犯，也针对乞丐、麻风病人以及“危险”或“可疑”人物。1866年，麦唐奈提出了一项缓解香港监狱人满为患的方案：囚犯自愿接受烙印或纹身并被驱逐出境，条件是如果他们胆敢返回香港，将被鞭笞并重新监禁。 +

MacDonnell’s most controversial reform was his short-lived plan to end police corruption by regulating gambling through licensing.  +

麦克唐奈比罗宾逊更加坚信欧洲人和中国人不应在法律面前享有同等待遇，因此他推行了一项范围更广的华人登记制度来管理华人人口。1866年，他试图控制所有进出港口的中国船只。麦克唐奈最具争议的改革是他短暂推行的通过发放许可证来规范赌博以根除警察腐败的计划。麦克唐奈的几乎所有措施都遭到了香港华人社区的反对，但结果却喜忧参半。一些华人在1866年登记条例颁布后直接离开了香港，而另一些人则通过拒缴新许可证费用来抵制其他条例，但这种反对总体上对政府政策影响甚微。然而，华人精英最终成功迫使麦克唐奈放弃了其赌博管制计划。1871年，他们在请愿书中指出，该制度加剧了腐败、破产、抢劫、自杀以及贩卖儿童为奴等现象。 +

Hennessy eventually had his way, and both branding and flogging practices were abolished by the Colonial Office in 1880 (although Hennessy’s successor, George Bowen, approved the flogging of prisoners as young as twelve and for very minor offenses).
与前任一样，麦克唐奈的继任者亨尼西也采用宽泛的犯罪定义和高检控率来控制华人人口。然而，亨尼西认为麦克唐奈的政策不人道，违反了英国的司法原则，因此试图废除鞭刑、烙印和纹身。为了使刑罚制度现代化，使其更符合当时的英国模式，他以更长的刑期取代了烙印和驱逐。虽然一些华人精英也反对亨尼西的改革，但华人社区普遍支持这些改革。亨尼西最终如愿以偿，殖民地事务部于1880年废除了烙印和鞭刑（尽管亨尼西的继任者乔治·鲍文批准对年仅十二岁的囚犯以及轻微罪行处以鞭刑）。 +

亨尼西在担任纳闽总督期间，对当地华人印象深刻，因此他也是首位认真争取香港华人支持和意见的总督。1880 年，正是亨尼西任命吴财为立法会议员，成为首位华人议员。尽管吴财的任命只是暂时的，但这反映了华人商界日益增长的影响力，他们早在 1879 年就要求增加代表权。吴财是当时香港唯一一位在英国接受教育的华人律师，出生于新加坡（因此是英国公民），并于 1877 年成为首位获得英国律师资格的华人。任期结束后，吴财返回中国，化名吴廷芳，先后担任清政府的法律顾问和首位中国驻美公使。直到 1883 年，鲍文总督说服殖民地事务部允许他提名三名非官方的立法委员会成员，其中一人必须是华人之后，立法委员会才始终有华人成员。鲍文提名了黄星，他是一位记者兼商人，曾在莫里森教育协会学校和美国接受教育，后来在美国的中国使馆任职。鲍文认为，黄星“完全有资格用英国人的视角看待中国事务，也能用中国人的视角看待英国事务”。 16 +

亨尼西也曾努力减少种族歧视和隔离。1877年和1880年，他允许华人购买此前专供欧洲人居住的土地。1880年，他帮助当地华人领袖终止了市政厅博物馆和图书馆的歧视性政策，此前华人只能在特定时间进入。亨尼西关于种族平等的自由主义思想早已疏远了他曾任总督的巴巴多斯的英国社群。在香港，欧洲社群将犯罪率上升，甚至华人缺乏纪律和对欧洲人的尊重归咎于他的“亲华”政策。他如此不受欧洲社群待见，以至于1882年初他离开香港时，没有一位英国商界人士前往码头参加传统的送别仪式。然而，华人社群的领袖们却前来向总督告别，并向他赠送了礼物和绣花丝绸旗帜。 +

如今，研究殖民政府如何管理其臣民的学者通常更关注殖民主义的文化层面，而非其政治或经济层面。例如，他们常常将殖民教育视为一种强有力的工具，旨在使学生在新殖民等级制度中发挥作用，培养顺从的公民，并在建立殖民精英的同时，将殖民者与被殖民者区分开来。同样，推行西方性别关系理念也帮助欧洲殖民者控制其臣民。例如，在印度，英国人规定了最低结婚年龄，并违背印度教习俗，敦促寡妇再婚。1829 年，他们取缔了殉葬（suttee）习俗，即印度教寡妇自愿与亡夫一同火化，以此表达对亡夫的虔诚。尽管许多印度人支持废除殉葬的做法，但一些学者认为，取缔殉葬是英国人彰显自身道德优越感并为殖民主义辩护的一种手段。在中国，欧洲女性为结束缠足这一传统习俗所做的努力，有助于使西方在华半殖民统治合法化。 +

尽管基督教教会在香港的教育体系中仍然扮演着重要角色，但在詹姆斯·莱格的指导下，政府开始更加积极地介入教育，并强调英语教学。（莱格虽然是一位传教士，但他反对教会控制教育和强制宗教教育。他也推崇儒家思想，认为没有必要用基督教取代儒家。）这一转变部分源于英国教育观念的转变——在英国，教会控制教育的做法已不再流行；部分源于殖民官员认为教授英语有助于改善中英关系。但这一转变也反映了日益壮大的中国中产阶级的态度和需求，他们越来越需要接受英语教育。政府于1862年创办的中央男校很快便比乡村学校更受当地中国中产阶级的欢迎。 （富裕的中国人通常会将儿子送回中国留学或聘请私人教师；一所女子公立学校于19世纪80年代末开办。）许多中国男孩将中央学校视为进入欧洲公司或清政府海关获得一份好工作的途径。到了19世纪70年代，毕业生们已经在当地商行、中国通商口岸、日本和美国找到了工作。 +

In 1877 the police magistrate estimated that only one out of every six Chinese women in Hong Kong were either married or concubines, the rest being prostitutes.
妓院和性病自香港殖民地建立之初便如影随形。由于英国占领后涌入的华人和欧洲人绝大多数是男性，香港的性别比例一直严重失衡。庞大的军队驻扎更是雪上加霜。尽管太平天国运动期间大量华人涌入带来了更多女性，但根据1872年首次正式人口普查，华人男女比例为七比一，欧洲人男女比例为五比一。到了19世纪50年代，香港已成为卖淫和性病（尤其是梅毒）的​​重灾区。1876年的人口普查显示，香港近两万五千名华人女性中，有六分之五是妓女。1877年，地方法官估计，香港每六名华人女性中只有一人是已婚或妾室，其余均为妓女。 +
====



This assumption that Chinese women who were either not married or concubines must necessarily have been prostitutes says more about European attitudes toward the Chinese community than about the actual number of prostitutes.  +
Because Europeans in Hong Kong often considered Chinese women to be sexual and moral hazards, from 1857 to 1890 prostitution was licensed and regulated, with brothels strictly confined to separate areas depending on whether they catered to Western or Chinese clients.  +
Similar to ordinances passed that year in Malta and the Ionian Islands (both British possessions), Hong Kong’s first contagious disease ordinance, passed in 1857, called for the licensing of brothels by the registrar general, compulsory weekly medical inspections of prostitutes, punishment of prostitutes (and the brothel keepers) who transmitted venereal diseases to clients, and the detainment of infected prostitutes in a lock hospital.  +
After the British Parliament passed the Contagious Diseases Acts of 1866 in England and Wales, the 1857 ordinance was replaced in Hong Kong by the Contagious Diseases Ordinance of 1867.  +
The colonial government now had even more power to regulate prostitution, for the new ordinance gave the registrar general and the police superintendent the right to enter suspected brothels without a warrant.  +
This, explains historian Philippa Levine, justified “a greater invasiveness into colonial lives, especially those of Chinese women.”18
这种认为未婚或妾室的中国女性必然是妓女的假设，更多地反映了欧洲人对华人社群的态度，而非妓女的实际数量。由于在港的欧洲人常常将中国女性视为性与道德上的隐患，因此从 1857 年到 1890 年，卖淫活动实行许可和监管，妓院根据服务对象是西方人还是中国人，被严格限制在不同的地段。与同年马耳他和爱奥尼亚群岛（均为英国属地）通过的法令类似，香港于 1857 年通过的第一部传染病条例规定，妓院由登记总署署长颁发许可证，妓女必须接受每周一次的强制性体检，将性病传染给嫖客的妓女（以及妓院经营者）绳之以法，并将感染性病的妓女关押在封闭式医院。英国议会于 1866 年在英格兰和威尔士通过《传染病法》后，香港也以 1867 年《传染病条例》取代了 1857 年的旧条例。殖民政府因此拥有了更大的权力来监管卖淫活动，因为新条例赋予了登记总署署长和警司无需搜查令即可进入疑似妓院的权力。历史学家菲利帕·莱文解释说，这使得“对殖民地人民生活，尤其是对中国妇女的生活，进行更大程度的侵犯成为可能”。 18 +
Colonial officials claimed that these ordinances saved girls and women from brothel slavery and from being exploited by brothel owners and kept prostitution from spreading into the respectable parts of town.  +
However, the ordinances were designed mainly to protect soldiers, sailors, and policemen from venereal diseases by maintaining a supply of disease-free Chinese women.  +
Only prostitutes who serviced Westerners had to be inspected, while in practice only the prostitutes servicing European police and soldiers were regulated.  +
In December 1880, Governor Hennessy explained to the secretary for the colonies that the “real purpose of the brothel legislation” in Hong Kong had not been the protection of prostitutes but rather “the provision of clean Chinese women for the use of the British soldiers and the sailors of the Royal Navy in this Colony.” Here the legislation had been successful.  +
However, “far from checking this odious species of slavery,” the ordinances had “undoubtedly intensified it.”19 In June 1881, Hennessy explained how “women are bought and sold in nearly every brothel in the place.”20 Although the Colonial Office did not support Hennessy’s plans to overhaul the ordinances, it approved minor amendments to them.
殖民官员声称，这些法令使女孩和妇女免于沦为妓院奴隶，免遭妓院老板的剥削，并阻止卖淫蔓延到城镇的体面区域。然而，这些法令的主要目的是通过维持无病中国女性的供应，来保护士兵、水手和警察免受性病的侵害。只有为西方人服务的妓女才需要接受检查，而实际上，只有为欧洲警察和士兵服务的妓女才受到监管。1880 年 12 月，总督轩尼诗向殖民地事务大臣解释说，香港“妓院立法的真正目的”并非保护妓女，而是“为本殖民地的英国士兵和皇家海军水手提供干净的中国女性”。在这一方面，立法取得了成功。然而，这些法令“非但没有遏制这种可憎的奴役形式”，反而“无疑加剧了这种现象”。 19 1881 年 6 月，亨尼西解释说，“当地几乎每家妓院都存在买卖妇女的情况。” 20 虽然殖民地事务部不支持亨尼西对法令进行全面改革的计划，但它批准了一些小的修改。 +
When the Colonial Office ordered colonial governments to end their contagious diseases laws after the British Parliament repealed the Contagious Diseases Acts in 1886, Governor William Des Voeux tried desperately to maintain the status quo.  +
Des Voeux argued that the colony’s security depended on the health of its soldiers and police and that the system was the only way to keep girls from being sold into prostitution, check the spread of venereal diseases, and keep brothels from spreading into the more respectable parts of town.  +
Finally, in 1889, the Legislative Council passed the Women and Girl’s Protection Ordinance, which repealed the Contagious Diseases Ordinance of 1867 but then reinstated almost all of the provisions for licensing and registering brothels.  +
Although this ordinance was repealed in 1890 because it violated the orders of the secretary for the colonies, its repeal seems to have had little effect because the same prostitutes who had heeded or ignored the earlier laws continued to do the same.
1886年，英国议会废除了《传染病法》，殖民地事务部随即命令各殖民地政府终止其传染病相关法律。当时的殖民地总督威廉·德·沃竭力维持现状。德·沃辩称，殖民地的安全取决于士兵和警察的健康，而这套制度是防止女孩被贩卖为妓女、遏制性病传播以及防止妓院蔓延至城镇较为体面区域的唯一途径。最终，在1889年，立法委员会通过了《妇女和女孩保护条例》，该条例废除了1867年的《传染病条例》，但几乎恢复了所有关于妓院许可和登记的规定。虽然这项法令因违反殖民地事务大臣的命令而在 1890 年被废除，但废除该法令似乎并没有产生多大影响，因为那些曾经遵守或无视先前法律的妓女们继续做着同样的事情。 +
While it did little to prevent brothel slavery or the exploitation of prostitutes, the licensing and regulation of prostitution met its main goal of helping to prevent the transmission of venereal diseases among soldiers and sailors and keeping brothels from spreading into more respectable areas of town (which appears to have been the main concern of the Chinese elite).  +
In 1893, however, fiery speeches in Parliament and pressure from groups in Britain forced the colonial government to stop all registration and inspection schemes.  +
Unlike in 1890, this time the change was dramatic.  +
Prostitutes stopped going for their medical inspections, new brothels opened in areas where they had not been before, and by 1897 about half of the soldiers in Hong Kong were being treated for venereal diseases (compared to about 15 percent a decade earlier).
尽管卖淫许可证制度对阻止妓院奴役或剥削妓女收效甚微，但它确实达到了其主要目标，即帮助防止性病在士兵和水手之间传播，并阻止妓院蔓延到城里更体面的地区（这似乎是中国精英阶层的主要担忧）。然而，1893年，议会中激烈的演讲以及来自英国各团体的压力迫使殖民政府停止了所有登记和检查制度。与1890年不同，这一次的变化是剧烈的。妓女不再接受体检，新的妓院在以前从未涉足的地区开业，到1897年，香港约有一半的士兵正在接受性病治疗（而十年前这一比例约为15%）。 +
What do we know about the prostitutes themselves? Many of the Chinese prostitutes were either kidnapped and sold into prostitution or sold by their impoverished parents.  +
Contemporary reports mention how young girls in Hong Kong often disguised themselves as boys in public to avoid being kidnapped.  +
Other prostitutes came from the already well-developed sex trades in Canton and Macau.  +
Most of the European prostitutes had been prostitutes before they came to Hong Kong, but some resorted to prostitution after falling on hard times.  +
Toward the end of the nineteenth century, among the European prostitutes were a large number of Jews who had fled the pogroms in Russia.  +
Shunned by other European women, these prostitutes lived mainly on the margins of the European parts of town or in the predominantly Chinese sections such as Wanchai.  +
The life of European prostitutes was not always one of humiliation and despair, however, for some rose high enough in society to retire comfortably in Europe or America.
我们对妓女本身了解多少？许多中国妓女要么是被绑架贩卖，要么是被贫困的父母卖掉。当时的记载提到，香港的年轻女孩经常女扮男装，以避免被绑架。其他妓女则来自广州和澳门，那里的性交易已经相当成熟。大多数欧洲妓女在来香港之前就已经是妓女，但也有一些人是因为生活困顿而被迫卖淫。十九世纪末，欧洲妓女中有很多是逃离俄罗斯大屠杀的犹太人。由于被其他欧洲女性排斥，这些妓女主要生活在欧洲人聚居区的边缘地带，或者像湾仔这样的华人聚居区。然而，欧洲妓女的生活并非总是充满屈辱和绝望，因为有些人最终在社会上取得了相当的地位，得以在欧洲或美国安享晚年。 +
In a group of their own were so-called protected women—Chinese women who served as mistresses to European men, especially before European women came in larger numbers later in the nineteenth century.  +
Many of these women were Tankas, some having been purchased by their European masters from brothels in Canton and Hong Kong.  +
Known to the Chinese as saltwater maids, these women lived in a marginal area of Hong Kong that was nestled between the European business and residential sections of town and was inhabited by a mixed group of European prostitutes, Indian merchants and shopkeepers, Portuguese, and Chinese prostitutes who serviced European and middle- and upper-class Chinese clients.  +
Although some of these protected women did well for themselves, the status of their protection could be very fragile.  +
Most European men eventually returned home, leaving their Chinese mistresses in Hong Kong, where they were often despised by the mainstream of the Chinese community.  +
The children of these women formed the beginnings of the Eurasian community.
在她们之中，还有一群被称为“受保护女性”的群体——她们是为欧洲男性提供性服务的中国女性，尤其是在 19 世纪后期欧洲女性大量涌入香港之前。这些女性大多是“浪娼”（Tanka），其中一些是被她们的欧洲主人从广州和香港的妓院买来的。这些女性被中国人称为“海女”，她们居住在香港一个边缘地带，夹在欧洲人的商业区和住宅区之间，居住着形形色色的人，包括欧洲妓女、印度商人、店主、葡萄牙人和中国妓女，她们服务于欧洲人和中国中上层阶级的客户。尽管有些受保护女性生活富裕，但她们的保护地位却非常脆弱。大多数欧洲男性最终返回家乡，留下她们的中国情妇在香港，这些情妇往往受到主流华人社区的鄙视。这些女性的后代构成了欧亚混血社区的雏形。 +
Mui-Tsai  梅蔡
Many of the girls and women in Hong Kong were mui-tsai (“little sisters”) who had been sold to wealthier families through an intermediary known as a pocket mother.  +
Found throughout China under a variety of names, this arrangement helped poor families find better homes for their daughters, while providing domestic help for wealthier families.  +
Although Hong Kong’s first ordinance, passed in 1844, banned slavery, neither the colonial government nor the majority of the Chinese population considered this to include the mui-tsai.  +
Despite some sporadic criticism, mainly from missionaries in Hong Kong and officials in Britain, the legal status of the system did not come into question until the late 1870s.
香港许多女孩和妇女都是“ 小妹 ”，她们通过被称为“口袋妈妈”的中间人被卖给富裕家庭。这种制度在中国各地都有，名称各异，它既帮助贫困家庭为女儿找到更好的归宿，又为富裕家庭提供家政服务。尽管香港于 1844 年颁布的第一部法令禁止奴隶制，但殖民政府和大多数中国民众都认为该法令并不包括 “小妹”制度。 尽管偶尔会有一些批评的声音，主要来自香港的传教士和英国官员，但直到 19 世纪 70 年代末，这一制度的合法性才受到质疑。 +

The reason that the mui-tsai issue became so controversial had much to do with timing.  +
By the late 1870s, an extensive network of kidnapping had developed to feed the need for prostitutes and servants in Hong Kong.  +
Girls were kidnapped from their native villages in China and then sold in Hong Kong.  +
With the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, the colony was becoming a popular destination for European and American tourists, many of whom were shocked that such a practice could be tolerated in a British colony.  +
The Victorian traveler Isabella Bird described the mui-tsai system as a “peculiar hateful form of slavery which is recognised by Chinese custom, and which has attained gigantic proportions in Victoria.”21 The issue had also attracted the attention of reformist groups in Britain, such as the Anti-Slavery Society and the Society for the Protection of Aborigines.  +
In California, American politicians used evidence of the mui-tsai to support restricting Chinese immigration to the United States.  +
Furthermore, local Chinese elites had become strong enough to protect a time-honored Chinese custom from which they benefited.  +
In November 1878, four prominent Chinese merchants—including Fung Ming Shan, a founder of the Nam Pak Hong Kung So—petitioned Governor Hennessy for permission to form an agency to stop the kidnapping of children from Dongguan, the four merchants’ native district in Guangdong.
梅妾问题之所以引发如此大的争议，很大程度上与时机有关。到了 19 世纪 70 年代末，为了满足香港对妓女和佣人的需求，一个庞大的绑架网络已经形成。女孩们从中国农村被绑架，然后被贩卖到香港。随着 1869 年苏伊士运河的开通，香港逐渐成为欧美游客的热门目的地，许多游客震惊于这种做法竟然会在英国殖民地被容忍。维多利亚时代的旅行家伊莎贝拉·伯德将梅妾制度描述为“一种奇特的、令人憎恶的奴隶制形式，它被中国习俗所认可，并在维多利亚州达到了惊人的规模。” 21 这个问题也引起了英国改革派团体的关注，例如反奴隶制协会和原住民保护协会。在美国加利福尼亚州，一些政客利用梅妾的证据来支持限制华人移民美国的政策。此外，当地华人精英势力日益强大，足以维护一项他们从中获益的古老习俗。1878 年 11 月，包括南白鸿公社创始人之一冯明山在内的四位华人商人向总督轩尼诗请愿，请求成立一个机构，制止从东莞（这四位商人的故乡）拐卖儿童的现象。 +
In October 1879, Chief Justice John Smale condemned the mui-tsai practice for violating British and Hong Kong laws prohibiting slavery.  +
Smale estimated that between ten thousand and twenty thousand girls were enslaved in Hong Kong.  +
“The more I penetrate below the polished surface of our civilization,” he declared, “the more convinced am I that the broad under-current of life here is more like that in the Southern States of the America when slavery was dominant, than it resembles the all-pervading civilization of England.”22 Smale’s attack caused a stir among the Chinese community, and less than two weeks later a group of Chinese merchants petitioned Governor Hennessy for permission to form an association to protect kidnapped women and children.  +
After reminding Hennessy of Charles Elliot’s proclamation of February 1841 guaranteeing Chinese in Hong Kong the right to practice their traditional customs, the petitioners went to great lengths to explain the difference between kidnapping and the mui-tsai system.  +
They also warned that banning the system would lead even more poor families in Guangdong to practice another traditional Chinese custom: drowning unwanted female babies at birth.
1879 年 10 月，首席大法官约翰·斯梅尔谴责 “梅仔” 制度违反了英国和香港禁止奴隶制的法律。斯梅尔估计，当时香港有 1 万至 2 万名女孩被奴役。他宣称：“我越深入了解我们文明光鲜亮丽的表象之下，就越确信，这里生活的暗流更像是奴隶制盛行时期的美国南部各州，而不是无处不在的英国文明。” 22 斯梅尔的抨击在华人社区引起了轩然大波。不到两周后，一群华人商人向总督轩尼诗请愿，请求成立一个协会，以保护被绑架的妇女儿童。请愿者们提醒轩尼诗，查尔斯·艾略特曾于 1841 年 2 月颁布公告，保障香港华人享有传统习俗的权利。随后，他们竭力解释绑架和 “梅仔” 制度之间的区别。他们还警告说，禁止这种制度会导致广东更多贫困家庭实行另一种中国传统习俗：溺死刚出生的女婴。 +
Many people in Hong Kong felt that Smale had unnecessarily condemned a perfectly acceptable, time-honored Chinese custom.  +
Complicating matters was the ambiguous status of the mui-tsai within the adoptive household—half servant, half family member—with some mui-tsai even eventually becoming concubines and inheriting their husbands’ wealth.  +
And one of the cardinal rules of British colonial administration was that tampering too much with native customs could be risky.  +
But critics considered the system a form of slavery that often encouraged sexual abuse.  +
Defenders, however, insisted that the girls were treated as family members and that the system saved girls from prostitution.
许多香港人认为 ，斯梅尔对一项完全合理且历史悠久的中国习俗进行了不必要的谴责。更复杂的是，梅菜在养父母家中的地位模糊不清——既是仆人，又是家庭成员——有些梅菜甚至最终成为妾室，继承丈夫的财产。英国殖民统治的一条重要原则就是，过度干预当地习俗可能会带来风险。但批评者认为，这种制度是一种奴隶制，常常助长性虐待。然而，支持者则坚称，这些女孩被视为家庭成员，而且这种制度使她们免于沦为娼妓。 +
By asking for permission to form a society to stop kidnapping, the Chinese elites were trying to distinguish between kidnapping and the mui-tsai system, thus attempting to preserve a custom in which they were so heavily invested.  +
Their petition was also a declaration that the Chinese elites had the wherewithal to handle the situation.  +
After a series of studies on whether the system constituted slavery, the matter went to the British House of Lords, which agreed that the colonial government should not interfere with customs that were so deeply ingrained in Chinese society.  +
In 1880 Hennessy approved the Chinese merchants’ plan, and the Po Leung Kuk (Society for the Protection of Women and Children) was officially opened in August 1882.  +
The Colonial Office eventually decided that the only thing necessary was to ensure that the mui-tsai were not being sold into prostitution, passing an ordinance to this effect in 1887.
通过请求成立一个制止拐卖的社团，中国精英试图区分拐卖和嫔妃制度，从而维护他们深耕多年的传统习俗。他们的请愿也表明，中国精英有能力处理此事。在对嫔妃制度是否构成奴隶制进行了一系列研究之后，此事提交至英国上议院。上议院一致认为，殖民政府不应干预根深蒂固于中国社会的习俗。1880 年，亨尼西批准了中国商人的计划，保良局（妇女儿童保护协会）于 1882 年 8 月正式成立。殖民地事务部最终认定，唯一需要做的就是确保嫔妃不被卖入妓院，并于 1887 年颁布了相关法令。 +
Especially compared to the movement to end the mui-tsai system after World War I, the debate in the late 1870s and the early 1880s was short-lived and confined mainly within Hong Kong.  +
Nor did the debate and the subsequent establishment of the Po Leung Kuk lead to any significant changes to the mui-tsai system.  +
Although Hennessy hoped that the Po Leung Kuk would end the practice, some critics considered the society a clever scheme for ensuring that wealthy Chinese families always had a steady supply of young servants and that wealthy Chinese men had a pool of potential concubines.  +
As Elizabeth Sinn argues, the Chinese merchants’ “triumph had long-term consequences.” Despite its many commendable charitable and philanthropic activities, the Po Leung Kuk upheld a “peculiarly Chinese form of patriarchy at a critical point of its development in Hong Kong.” Once the controversy had subsided, “official inertia set in again,” and the mui-tsai system was left “unquestioned” until 1917.23 Sociologist Henry Lethbridge concluded that instead of ending the system, the Po Leung Kuk “helped, indirectly, to maintain in servitude numbers of Chinese girls until long after the First World War.”24
与一战后废除嫔妃制度的运动相比，19 世纪 70 年代末 80 年代初的这场辩论持续时间很短，且主要局限于香港。这场辩论以及随后保良局的成立，也并未对嫔妃制度带来任何实质性的改变。尽管轩尼诗希望保良局能够终结这一陋习，但一些批评人士认为，保良局不过是确保富裕华人家庭始终拥有源源不断的年轻仆人，以及富裕华人男性拥有众多潜在妾室的巧妙手段。正如伊丽莎白·辛恩所言，华人商人的“胜利产生了深远的影响”。尽管保良局开展了许多值得称道的慈善活动，但它在香港发展的关键时期，却维护了一种“独特的中国式父权制”。争议平息后，“官方惯性再次出现”， 女傩制度一直“未受质疑”地延续到 1917 年。 23 社会学家亨利·莱斯布里奇得出结论，保良局非但没有废除这一制度，反而“间接地帮助维持了大量中国女孩的奴役状态，直至第一次世界大战后很长一段时间”。 24 +
