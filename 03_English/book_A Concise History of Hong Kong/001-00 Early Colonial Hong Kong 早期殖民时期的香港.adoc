`主` The Chinese government’s official position 姿势，观点，立场 toward Hong Kong’s history `系` is spelled out 用字母拼写,解释明白；讲清楚 succinctly 简洁地；简要地 in _The Basic Law_ of _the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region_ 行政区 of _the People’s Republic of China_, the miniconstitution 迷你宪法 that has governed Hong Kong since its reversion 回归；归还 to Chinese sovereignty 主权 in July 1997: “Hong Kong has been part of the territory 领土；版图 of China since ancient times; it was occupied 占据；侵占 by Britain after the Opium War 鸦片战争 in 1840.”  +
#Whereas# 然而；尽管 Chinese historians often stress 强调 how Hong Kong *has played a vital 至关重要的；生死攸关的 role* in Chinese history _since time memorial_ (a.纪念的；悼念的) 自纪念时间以来, 自古以来；远古以来, until recently British sources (信息来源；原始资料)  英国方面资料,英国史学界 generally #*dismissed*# 不予考虑；摒弃；驳回 the idea of Hong Kong #*as*# 把 A 当作 B 而否定,不予理会 having any real history until the British arrived.

但直到最近，英国方面的资料普遍否定 “香港在英国到来之前, 拥有任何真正历史” 这一观点。

`主` A guidebook written in 1893 by a local British resident `谓` insisted 坚持,坚称 that /until 1841 Hong Kong “existed (v.) only as _a plutonic  （火成岩）深成的；火成的 island_ of uninviting 无魅力的,令人不快的；无吸引力的 sterility 贫瘠；不毛,不孕, apparently *capable 能够的；有能力的 only of* supporting _the lowest form_ of organisms 生物；有机体.”  +
Many years later, journalist Richard Hughes, who popularized (v.)使普及；使流行；推广 the idea of Hong Kong as _a “borrowed place_ living on 依靠，以……为生 _borrowed time_ 苟延残喘；借时度日；在借来的时光中生存,” wrote that “Hong Kong did not exist, so it was necessary to invent 创造；虚构；发明 it.”

-> From French plutonique ‎(“of or pertaining to #Pluto#(冥王星；冥王), the underworld, interior of the Earth”)

.a “borrowed place living on borrowed time”
“A borrowed place living on borrowed time” 这句话常被用来形容香港在殖民时期的特殊地位，其含义可从两个层面理解：

- **“借来的地方”：指香港（尤指香港岛）是英国通过《南京条约》（1842年）从清政府手中“借用”或割占的领土，**其统治权并非基于历史或自然延续，而是依托殖民条约建立的临时性安排。
- **“借来的时间”：暗指这种殖民统治的“临时性”——英国对香港的治理, 始终面临"主权归属"的不确定性，**尤其是20世纪后半叶随着中国实力增强、国际局势变化，香港的未来注定需要重新协商，殖民统治的“倒计时”早已开始。

这句话精准捕捉了香港在殖民时期的矛盾性：一方面，英国在此建立了繁荣的贸易枢纽和都市体系（“发明了香港”）；另一方面，其存在始终笼罩在主权未定的阴影下，直至1997年归还中国。记者理查德·休斯引用此说法，亦反映了国际社会对香港前途的普遍认知。

The Chinese government’s official position toward Hong Kong’s history is spelled out succinctly in The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, the miniconstitution that has governed Hong Kong since its reversion to Chinese sovereignty in July 1997: “Hong Kong has been part of the territory of China since ancient times; it was occupied by Britain after the Opium War in 1840.” Whereas Chinese historians often stress how Hong Kong has played a vital role in Chinese history since time memorial, until recently British sources generally dismissed the idea of Hong Kong as having any real history until the British arrived.  +
A guidebook written in 1893 by a local British resident insisted that until 1841 Hong Kong “existed only as a plutonic island of uninviting sterility, apparently capable only of supporting the lowest form of organisms.”1 Many years later, journalist Richard Hughes, who popularized the idea of Hong Kong as a “borrowed place living on borrowed time,” wrote that “Hong Kong did not exist, so it was necessary to invent it.”
中国政府对香港历史的官方立场在《中华人民共和国香港特别行政区基本法》中得到了简洁明了的阐述。这部自 1997 年 7 月香港回归中国以来一直作为香港的“小宪法”进行治理：“香港自古以来就是中国领土的一部分；1840 年鸦片战争后被英国占领。” 尽管中国历史学家经常强调香港自古以来在中国历史上扮演着至关重要的角色，但直到最近，英国方面的资料普遍否认香港在英国到来之前拥有任何真正的历史。一位英国当地居民在 1893 年撰写的一本指南中坚称，直到 1841 年，香港“仅仅是一个荒凉贫瘠的孤岛，似乎只能维持最低等生物的生存”。 1 多年后，记者理查德·休斯（Richard Hughes）——他曾将香港比作“借来的地方，生活在借来的时间里”——写道：“香港并不存在，所以有必要把它创造出来。”  +

波利尼西亚, 是大洋洲的一个次区域 ，由散布在中太平洋和南太平洋的 1000 多个岛屿组成。居住在波利尼西亚岛屿上的土著居民, 被称为波利尼西亚人 。他们有很多共同之处，包括语言关系 、 文化习俗和传统信仰 。

By tradition, the islands located in the southern Pacific have also often been called the South Sea Islands,[2] and their inhabitants have been called South Sea Islanders. The Hawaiian Islands have often been considered to be part of the South Sea Islands because of their relative proximity to the southern Pacific islands, even though they are in fact located in the North Pacific. Another term in use, which avoids this inconsistency, is "the Polynesian Triangle" (from the shape created by the layout of the islands in the Pacific Ocean). This term makes clear that the grouping includes the Hawaiian Islands, which are located at the northern vertex of the referenced "triangle".

按照传统，位于南太平洋的岛屿也常被称为南海群岛 [ 2 ] ，其居民则被称为南海岛民 。 夏威夷群岛由于与南太平洋岛屿相对接近，常被认为是南海群岛的一部分，尽管它们实际上位于北太平洋 。另一个避免这种不一致的说法是**“ 波利尼西亚三角 ”（源于太平洋岛屿的布局所形成的形状）。**这个说法明确指出，*该区域包含了位于该“三角” 北端的夏威夷群岛。*

**波利尼西亚的特点是陆地面积小，却横跨太平洋中部和南部的大片海域。**其陆地面积约为 30 万至 31 万平方公里（11.7 万至 11.8 万平方英里），其中超过 27 万平方公里（ 10.3 万平方英里）位于新西兰境内。夏威夷群岛则占据了剩余面积的大约一半。

Precolonial Hong Kong was not the “barren island” or “barren rock” that British historians, colonial officials, and journalists have often described.  +
Archaeological findings from the Hong Kong region date back almost six thousand years, to the Neolithic period.  +
According to Chinese historical records, southern China was settled by the Hundred Yue tribes, who were more closely related to Malays, Vietnamese, or Polynesians than to Han Chinese, the ethnic majority of China, and who are believed to have made the rock carvings still preserved in several local sites.  +
The Southern Yue Kingdom ruled Hong Kong until 111 BCE, when it fell to the army of Wu Di, emperor of the Han dynasty.  +
A tomb uncovered at Lei Cheng Uk, Kowloon, in 1955 is believed to be from the Han period.  +
Over the next millennium, partly because of the warfare and disunity that characterized much of that period and partly because of the economic opportunities in southern China, Chinese increasingly moved from north to south, including to Kowloon, the peninsula across the harbor from Hong Kong Island.  +
Chinese historical records frequently mention Kowloon as the place where the emperor of the Southern Song dynasty sought refuge after China fell to the Mongols.
前殖民时期的香港并非英国历史学家、殖民官员和记者常描述的“荒岛”或“贫瘠岩石”。香港地区的考古发现可以追溯到近六千年前的新石器时代。据中国史料记载，中国南方曾居住着百越部落，他们与马来人、越南人或波利尼西亚人的血缘关系比与中国主体民族汉族更为密切，据信他们创作了至今仍保存在当地多处遗址的岩刻。南越王国统治香港直至公元前111年，最终被汉武帝的军队攻陷。1955年在九龙利城屋发现的一座墓葬据信属于汉代。在接下来的一千年里，部分原因是战乱和分裂充斥着这一时期，部分原因是中国南方蕴藏着巨大的经济机遇，中国人越来越多地从北向南迁徙，其中包括九龙——位于香港岛对岸的半岛。中国史籍多次提及九龙，称南宋皇帝在蒙古人入侵后曾到此避难。

During the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1276–1368), Hong Kong was inhabited mainly by farmers, fisherfolk, and pirates, some of them Song loyalists.  +
By the end of the Yuan dynasty, the Hong Kong region had been settled mainly by seven large families who owned much of the land.  +
Throughout the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), settlers from Guangdong and Fujian, the two prominent coastal provinces of southeastern China, migrated to Kowloon.  +
Some of these settlers moved across the harbor to Hong Kong Island, but the island remained lightly populated, with only a few villages scattered along its southern coast.  +
During the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), when China was ruled by the Manchus, Hong Kong became more closely integrated with the rest of China.  +
Fishing boats from other parts of southern China used the local harbors.  +
The island was part of Xin’an county, and an assistant magistrate from Kowloon visited the island occasionally to collect land taxes and register fishing vessels, leaving local headmen or village elders in charge of local government.  +
In the early 1800s, the island was the stronghold of the infamous pirate Zhang Baozai, who used the island’s peak as a lookout for his buccaneering exploits.

在元朝（1276-1368年）时期，香港主要居住着农民、渔民和海盗，其中一些人是宋朝的拥护者。元朝末年，香港地区主要由七个拥有大量土地的大家族定居。明朝（1368-1644年）时期，来自中国东南沿海两大省份广东和福建的移民涌入九龙。其中一些人迁往香港岛，但当时香港岛人口稀少，只有零星几个村庄散布在南部沿海。清朝（1644-1911年）时期，中国由满族统治，香港与中国其他地区的联系日益紧密。来自中国南方其他地区的渔船也开始使用香港的港口。该岛隶属于新安县，九龙的县令偶尔会到岛上征收地税、登记渔船，地方政务则由当地村长或长者负责。19世纪初，该岛是臭名昭著的海盗张宝载的据点，他曾利用岛上的山峰作为瞭望哨，监视其海盗行径。 +

#Not only# was Hong Kong hardly 几乎不，几乎没有 a “barren 贫瘠的；不毛的 island” when the British arrived in the late 1830s, #but# Hong Kong’s people were far from 远离，远非 the “handful 少数；少量 of fishermen and pirates 海盗” they have often been described as.
*As* 正如 historian 历史学家 and former colonial 殖民的 official 官员 James Hayes *explains*, farming was the “principal 主要的 occupation 职业；工作.”  +
The island had “several villages of some size, as well as hamlets 小村庄, and a few _larger coastal 沿海的 villages_ which *served as* 充当；作为 market towns 集镇 for the villages *and as* home ports 母港 for a _permanent 永久的；常驻的 boat population_ 指长期生活在船上的居民（即水上人家/疍民） and _visiting craft_ (船只；船舶) 指外来的、临时到访的船只（如商船、渔船等）.”  +

.hamlet
a very small village 小村庄 +
-> ham-,#即 home,家，家园，村庄，#-let,小词后缀。见Beckham.

.home ports for _a permanent boat population_ and _visiting craft_
（这些较大的沿海村庄）是永久性船民群体的‘家港’，也是往来船只的停靠港。

- home ports：不单指“港口”，更强调是船民群体的居住基地与生活中心。船民（疍家人等）常以船为家，但需要沿岸的村庄进行交易、补給、社交等活动。
- permanent boat population：指长期生活在船上的居民（即水上人家/疍民），他们在该区域定居，形成稳定的水上社区。
- visiting craft：指外来的、临时到访的船只（如商船、渔船等），这些村庄为其提供停泊、交易或休整的场所。

.a permanent boat population (常年以船为家的水上居民) 为何前面要有个 a?

为什么必须有 a？ +
population 在这里不是 “人口”，而是 “一群人、一类群体”，是可数名词。 +

- a population = 某一类人群、某一群人
- a permanent boat population = 一个常年以船为家的群体 / 水上常住居民群体

它强调的是：这是一类特定的人，不是整个岛的总人口。

类似用法： +
- a homeless population 无家可归者群体 +
- a rural population 农村人口群体 +
- a floating population 流动人口 +

a permanent boat population
= 一类常年住在船上的人（可数群体 → 必须加 a）

Hong Kong’s temples alone, argues 主张；认为 Hayes, prove that “the island was certainly well-established 稳固建立的；成熟的 in settled communities long before 1841.”

[.my1]

这句话使用了部分倒装。

- 原句结构：
Hong Kong’s temples alone, argues Hayes, prove that...
- 正常语序应为：
Hayes argues that /Hong Kong’s temples alone​ *prove that*...

这里使用倒装主要是出于以下原因:

- 强调主语​: +
倒装后，句子真正的主语 “Hong Kong’s temples alone”​ 被移到了动词 “proves”​ 之前，并且**放在了句首最突出的位置。这强调了是“香港的庙宇本身”​ 提供了关键证据，**而不是其他材料或观点，突出了“物证”的客观性。

- 衔接与流畅性​: +
*在上下文中，前文可能一直在描述香港岛的早期社会状况，将“Hong Kong’s temples”放在句首，可以与上文内容形成更紧密的话题衔接，使论述自然过渡到海耶斯的观点。#如果把“Hayes argues”放在句首，则会打断对“物证”的连续性讨论，将读者的注意力先转移到“学者”身上。#*

- 文体风格​ : +
这种“名词短语 + 插入的引述动词 + 主要动词”（例如："…," argues Hayes, "…"或 "…," he writes, "…"）**是英语学术写作和历史著作中, 引证他人观点时的经典句式。**它既指明了观点来源，又保持了论述的客观性和流畅性，*#避免让“某人说”这类表达显得过于突兀或主观。#*

倒装的效果：

- 客观性：句式暗示观点是由证据本身（庙宇）引出的，而学者（Hayes）只是发现并陈述这一事实的人，增强了论证的说服力。
- 节奏感：将较长的名词主语提前，插入短小的“argues Hayes”，再接谓语（prove），使句子节奏更有变化，更符合书面语的韵律。

Not only was Hong Kong hardly a “barren island” when the British arrived in the late 1830s, but Hong Kong’s people were far from the “handful of fishermen and pirates” they have often been described as.  +
As historian and former colonial official James Hayes explains, farming was the “principle occupation.” The island had “several villages of some size, as well as hamlets, and a few larger coastal villages which served as market towns for the villages and as home ports for a permanent boat population and visiting craft.” Hayes concludes that “long before 1841,” the inhabitants of Hong Kong Island had “settled into the routine of a settled life.  +
Tied to their fields and houses, and to their businesses and daily occupations, they had established institutions of the kind that is usual in Chinese communities, including the shrines and temples that were the object of periodic and special rites through the calendar year.” Hong Kong’s temples alone, argues Hayes, prove that “the island was certainly well-established in settled communities long before 1841.”
19 世纪 30 年代末英国人抵达香港时，这里绝非“荒岛”，香港居民也远非人们常说的“寥寥几位渔民和海盗”。正如历史学家、前殖民地官员詹姆斯·海耶斯所解释的那样，农业是“主要职业”。岛上有“几个规模较大的村庄，以及一些小村落，还有一些较大的沿海村庄，这些村庄既是周边村庄的集镇，也是常住居民和来往船只的母港”。海耶斯总结道，“早在 1841 年之前”，香港岛的居民就已经“安顿下来，过上了规律的生活。他们耕耘田地，操持家务，从事各种生意和日常工作，建立了华人社区常见的各种机构，包括寺庙和祠堂，这些场所会在一年中的不同时期举行各种祭祀仪式。”海耶斯认为，仅香港的寺庙就足以证明“早在 1841 年之前，香港岛就已存在成熟的定居社区” 。³ +
