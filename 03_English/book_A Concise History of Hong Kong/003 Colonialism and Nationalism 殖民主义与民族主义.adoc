Colonialism and Nationalism
殖民主义与民族主义
In 1891, Hong Kong observed its fiftieth anniversary under British rule with a celebration truly befitting of a proper British jubilee: ships decorated with lights, church services at the Anglican and Catholic cathedrals, a royal salute fired from ships in the harbor, a review of military forces at the horse racing course in Happy Valley, sporting contests, and a public ball at City Hall.  +
Although the jubilee reiterated the familiar, self-congratulating themes of British colonialism, it was truly a collaborative affair, for local European, Chinese, Eurasian, and Indian leaders all helped organize the festivities.  +
This collaboration was reflected in the jubilee rhetoric, which emphasized Hong Kong as a meeting point of East and West: “a curious commentary on the relative characteristics of Western and Oriental enterprise.”
1891年，香港庆祝其在英国统治五十周年，其庆典盛况空前，堪称一场名副其实的英国庆典：船只灯火辉煌，圣公会和天主教堂举行礼拜仪式，港口船只鸣放皇家礼炮，在跑马地赛马场检阅军队，举办体育比赛，并在市政厅举行公众舞会。尽管庆典重申了英国殖民主义惯用的自夸主题，但它确实是一场合作盛会，因为当地的欧洲、中国、欧亚混血和印度裔领袖都参与了庆典的组织工作。这种合作精神也体现在庆典的宣传语中，强调香港是东西方文化的交汇点：“这巧妙地诠释了东西方企业各自的特点。” +
Jubilees and other commemorations create idealized representations of societies and their histories.  +
What the 1891 jubilee rhetoric did not explain was that the segregated Chinese and European communities often remained highly suspicious of each other, as would become evident during the bubonic plague of 1894.  +
Many disgruntled Europeans wanted more political representation and a larger role in managing the colony they had helped to build.  +
Alarmed by the rise of Chinese nationalism and the potential threats from other powers in the late 1800s, these Europeans also became increasingly worried about the colony’s defense, a fear partly assuaged by Britain’s acquisition of the New Territories in 1898.  +
And even as they became more concerned about the fate of their ancestral homeland, many Hong Kong Chinese—especially among the rising bourgeoisie—began to see themselves as a special group of Chinese.
周年庆典和其他纪念活动往往会塑造社会及其历史的理想化形象。1891年的周年庆典言辞未能解释的是，当时隔离的华人社区和欧洲人社区之间常常存在着高度的猜忌，这一点在1894年的黑死病疫情中暴露无遗。许多心怀不满的欧洲人渴望获得更多的政治代表权，并在他们曾参与建设的殖民地管理中扮演更重要的角色。随着19世纪末中国民族主义的兴起以及其他列强潜在威胁的出现，这些欧洲人也日益担忧殖民地的防御，而英国在1898年对新界的收购在一定程度上缓解了他们的这种担忧。即便他们越来越关注祖籍国的命运，许多香港华人——尤其是新兴资产阶级——也开始将自己视为一个特殊的华人群体。 +
THE PIAGUE OF 1894  1894年的皮雅格
In May 1894, Hong Kong was stricken with bubonic plague believed to have originated in Canton, where some one hundred thousand people died.  +
The known death toll in the colony over the next five months was more than twenty-five hundred, mainly among the Chinese lower classes.  +
Governor William Robinson reported on May 17 that the plague was “entirely confined to the poorer classes of Chinese.”1 The colonial government responded by conducting house-to-house searches for infected people and quarantining victims on board the Hygeia, a hospital ship supervised by European doctors.  +
These plague measures met with great resistance from much of the Chinese community.  +
Many Chinese distrusted Western medicine, with its emphasis on disinfection and surgery.  +
Resenting house-to-house searches by male inspectors, which they considered a violation of women’s privacy, some residents hid their sick relatives from the inspectors.  +
Approximately eighty thousand people left Hong Kong during the epidemic.  +
All sorts of rumors spread: doctors were cutting open pregnant women and gouging out their babies’ eyes to make medicine; the government was planning to select children from local schools and surgically remove their livers to obtain bile, the only known cure, and to send any child with the slightest pimple or boil to the Hygeia.  +
Placards in Canton warned people against going to Hong Kong, where Western doctors were allegedly cutting up Chinese women and children.  +
The colonial government issued its own proclamations, warning inhabitants not to believe such “wild and baseless rumours.”2 The Tung Wah Hospital Committee was divided.  +
Some committee members resisted the government’s plague measures; others openly supported the government and criticized the Chinese for not complying.
1894 年 5 月，香港爆发鼠疫，据信起源于广州，造成约十万人死亡。在接下来的五个月里，香港已知的死亡人数超过两千五百人，主要集中在华人下层阶级。总督威廉·罗宾逊于 5 月 17 日报告称，鼠疫“完全局限于华人贫苦阶层”。 殖民政府的应对措施是挨家挨户搜查感染者，并将患者隔离在由欧洲医生监管的医院船 “海吉亚号” 上。这些防疫措施遭到了华人社区的强烈抵制。 许多华人不信任西医，因为西医强调消毒和手术。一些居民对男性检查员挨家挨户的搜查感到不满，认为这是对女性隐私的侵犯，因此将患病的亲属藏匿起来，不让检查员发现。疫情期间，约有八万人离开香港。各种谣言四起：医生剖开孕妇的肚子，挖出婴儿的眼睛来制药；政府计划从当地学校挑选儿童，切除他们的肝脏以获取胆汁——当时唯一已知的治疗方法——并将任何长了小疙瘩或疖子的孩子送到 “海吉亚号”上。 广州的告示牌警告人们不要去香港，因为据说西方医生在那里对中国妇女和儿童进行手术。殖民政府发布公告，警告居民不要相信这种“毫无根据的谣言”。2 东华医院委员会内部出现分歧。 一些委员会成员抵制政府的防疫措施；另一些人则公开支持政府，并批评中国不遵守规定。 +
Europeans generally dismissed this resistance to the government’s plague measures as xenophobia, superstition, and hostility toward Western medicine, but the situation was considerably more complex.  +
Like most colonial governments, the Hong Kong government had never taken such an interventionist role in colonial medicine and public health.  +
Until the mid-1800s, colonial medicine had been concerned mainly with protecting Europeans from the harmful effects of their tropical environments.  +
Only after the bacteriological revolution of the late 1800s was disease associated with contagious persons rather than with unhealthy tropical environments.  +
In response to an 1882 report by Osbert Chadwick, an engineer sent by the British government to examine health and sanitary conditions in Hong Kong, in 1883 the colonial government established the Sanitary Board, which was given the power to inspect and disinfect private homes and to quarantine contagious persons in hospitals.  +
However, the board was unable to carry out most of these measures.  +
It was opposed mainly by landlords and merchants, who worried that measures to reduce overcrowding and improve sanitation would be too expensive and who often justified their arguments by pointing to the colonial government’s historical promise to let the Chinese keep their own customs.
欧洲人普遍认为，香港民众对政府防疫措施的抵制是仇外心理、迷信和对西方医学的敌视，但实际情况远比这复杂得多。与大多数殖民地政府一样，香港政府此前从未在殖民地医学和公共卫生领域扮演过如此积极的干预角色。直到 19 世纪中期，殖民地医学主要关注的是保护欧洲人免受热带环境的有害影响。直到 19 世纪末细菌学革命之后，人们才开始将疾病与传染源联系起来，而非与不健康的热带环境联系起来。1882 年，英国政府派遣工程师奥斯伯特·查德威克（Osbert Chadwick）对香港的卫生状况进行了考察，并提交了一份报告。1883 年，殖民地政府根据这份报告成立了卫生局，该局被赋予了检查和消毒私人住宅以及在医院隔离传染病患者的权力。然而，卫生局却无力执行这些措施中的大多数。反对这项措施的主要人士是地主和商人，他们担心减少人口过密和改善卫生条件的措施成本太高，他们经常以殖民政府曾承诺让华人保留自己的习俗为由，来为自己的观点辩护。 +

Furthermore, there was no reason for the Chinese population to necessarily accept the validity of the government’s plague measures.  +
To Europeans, the plague seemed to prove the latest theories about disease, for it appeared to be confined to the poorer and more crowded Chinese parts of town.  +
Although some colonial officials derided the Chinese for believing that the plague emanated from the ground after long periods of hot, dry weather, Western medical theory had not yet established that plague was transmitted by rats; most medical officials believed that it was caused primarily by poor hygiene and overcrowding.  +
Thus, the government’s an-tiplague policies focused mainly on controlling and isolating the contagions of the disease: the Chinese population (the death rate for infected Europeans was substantially lower than for Chinese).  +
The Sanitary Board, now given more power, ordered troops to search homes, remove and burn corpses, and isolate plague victims in the Hygeia.  +
Many houses were burned down, leading to massive dislocation.  +
As the Chinese were responding to what they saw as the government’s intrusive policies, their resistance was both rational and remarkably similar to responses in other colonial and noncolonial societies.
此外，中国民众没有理由必然接受政府的防疫措施。对欧洲人来说，这场瘟疫似乎印证了当时最新的疾病理论，因为它似乎只局限于华人居住的贫困拥挤的地区。尽管一些殖民官员嘲笑中国人认为瘟疫是在长期炎热干燥的天气后从地底滋生的，但当时的西方医学理论尚未证实瘟疫是由老鼠传播的；大多数医学官员认为，瘟疫主要是由卫生条件差和人口过度拥挤造成的。因此，政府的防疫政策主要集中在控制和隔离疾病的传染源：华人（欧洲感染者的死亡率远低于华人）。卫生委员会权力扩大后，下令军队搜查民宅，移走并焚烧尸体，并将瘟疫患者隔离在 “海吉亚”（Hygeia ）隔离区。许多房屋被烧毁，导致大规模的流离失所。中国人对政府的干涉性政策做出了回应，他们的抵抗既理性，又与其他殖民地和非殖民地社会的回应惊人地相似。 +
The plague of 1894 had several important effects on Hong Kong society.  +
Although some Chinese leaders had helped distribute medicine, many colonial officials and European residents criticized both Chinese medicine and the Tung Wah Hospital.  +
In 1896, medical officials demanded that the hospital be abolished.  +
This prompted an inquiry commission, which recommended that the hospital be supervised by the Medical Department, that Western medicine be offered on a voluntary basis, and that a Chinese resident surgeon trained in Western medicine be appointed.  +
In 1897, the government appointed a Chinese steward to oversee the sanitation of the hospital.  +
As the resistance to the government’s plague measures seemed to prove how little the Chinese population understood Western ideas of health and sanitation, Europeans and some Chinese elites demanded more English in schools.  +
The plague also reaffirmed many Europeans’ conviction that they needed to stay as far away as possible from the Chinese.
1894年的鼠疫对香港社会产生了诸多重要影响。尽管一些华人领袖曾协助分发药品，但许多殖民地官员和欧洲居民却对中医和东华医院都持批评态度。1896年，一些医疗官员要求解散东华医院。这促使当局成立调查委员会，该委员会建议由卫生部门监管东华医院，西医治疗应以自愿为原则，并任命一位接受过西医培训的华人驻院外科医生。1897年，政府任命了一位华人管事负责医院的卫生工作。由于民众对政府防疫措施的抵制似乎表明华人对西方健康和卫生理念的理解十分匮乏，欧洲人和一些华人精英要求学校增加英语课程。这场鼠疫也更加坚定了许多欧洲人的信念，即他们需要尽可能远离华人。 +
Still, the suppression of the plague was not a victory for either the colonial government or Western medicine.  +
Although local colonial medical officials criticized the Tung Wah Hospital for continuing to offer Chinese medicine, which was dismissed as empiricism and quackery, the Colonial Office opposed any attempts to close the hospital.  +
And even though by the end of the nineteenth century half of the patients at the Tung Wah Hospital were choosing Western medicine, the fatality rate for these patients was initially higher than for those who chose Chinese medicine.  +
The Hong Kong plague was also probably responsible for the one that afflicted India in 1896–1900.  +
As in Hong Kong, part of the Western-educated Indian middle class was critical of the way that hospitalization and segregation were carried out.  +
As in Hong Kong, all kinds of rumors spread, although in India they were compounded by rumors of general catastrophe and the collapse of British rule: inoculation brought instant death, hospitals were poisoning victims and cutting up bodies to extract their momiai (vital oil), and even healthy people were being hospitalized and would never leave alive.  +
Only after widespread resistance from the Indian population did the colonial government agree to end or modify some of the more coercive plague measures.
然而，灭鼠行动对殖民政府和西方医学而言都并非胜利。尽管当地殖民医疗官员批评东华医院继续提供中医治疗，认为中医是经验主义和庸医，但殖民地事务部却反对任何关闭该医院的企图。即便到 19 世纪末，东华医院一半的病人选择了西医，但这些病人的死亡率最初仍高于选择中医的病人。香港的鼠疫很可能也是 1896 年至 1900 年印度鼠疫的源头。与香港的情况类似，部分受过西方教育的印度中产阶级对当时的住院治疗和隔离措施持批评态度。与香港一样，各种谣言四起，但在印度，谣言更加甚嚣尘上，充斥着关于灾难降临和英国统治崩溃的种种传言：接种疫苗会导致立即死亡，医院毒害受害者并肢解尸体以提取其“生命之油”（ momiai ），甚至连健康人也被送进医院，而且永远无法活着离开。只有在印度民众的广泛抵抗之后，殖民政府才同意停止或修改一些更具强制性的瘟疫防控措施。 +
THE REFORM MOVEMENT OF 1894
1894年的改革运动
By the end of the nineteenth century, Hong Kong was the only British colony with such a limited form of self-government.  +
Although the Chinese community rarely questioned this system, many Europeans believed that they deserved a larger role in running the colony they had helped build.  +
In 1894, the Constitutional Reform Association petitioned for the right to elect British nationals as unofficial members in the Legislative Council and for more control over the colony’s finances.  +
The British government, however, rejected this as a poorly disguised attempt to gain power for Europeans.  +
Secretary for the Colonies Lord Ripon, formerly the viceroy of India, argued that because Hong Kong had “become a Chinese rather than a British community” and Chinese settlement formed the “one main element in its prosperity,” he could not sanction any representation that would exclude the Chinese.3 The Colonial Office also feared that giving in to any European demands would encourage the Chinese to make similar requests.  +
Although he raised the possibility of appointing a Chinese to the Executive Council, Lord Ripon warned that granting representation to Europeans would mean giving more representation to the Chinese.
到十九世纪末，香港是唯一一个自治权如此有限的英国殖民地。尽管华人社群很少质疑这一制度，但许多欧洲人认为，他们理应在自己参与建设的殖民地管理中扮演更重要的角色。1894 年，宪政改革协会请愿，要求选举英国国民作为非官方成员进入立法会，并要求对殖民地财政拥有更大的控制权。然而，英国政府驳回了这一请愿，认为这是欧洲人企图攫取权力的拙劣伎俩。曾任印度总督的殖民地事务大臣里彭勋爵辩称，由于香港“已成为华人而非英国人聚居地”，华人定居是“香港繁荣的主要因素”，因此他不能批准任何排除华人参与的代表权。殖民地事务部也担心，如果对任何欧洲人的要求做出让步，都会鼓励华人提出类似的要求。尽管里彭勋爵提出了任命一名中国人进入行政委员会的可能性，但他警告说，给予欧洲人代表权就意味着给予中国人更多的代表权。 +
Ironically, the 1894 petition for constitutional reform ended up benefiting the Chinese community more than the European community.  +
The Legislative Council was increased by one official and one unofficial member, but the latter was Wei Yuk, a comprador and entrepreneur appointed in 1896.  +
In May 1896, Lord Ripon’s successor, Joseph Chamberlain, ordered that two unofficial members be added to the Executive Council.  +
They were to be selected “at the discretion of the Governor” from the unofficial members of the Legislative Council and “by consideration of personal merit” and with “no reference to the particular class or race.”4 A Chinese was not appointed to the Executive Council until 1926, but given how the 1894 movement for reform inadvertently benefited the Chinese community, the European community did not seriously mention constitutional reform again until after World War I.
具有讽刺意味的是，1894 年的宪政改革请愿最终使华人社区比欧洲社区受益更多。立法委员会增加了一名官方成员和一名非官方成员，但后者是魏玉，一位买办和企业家，于 1896 年被任命。1896 年 5 月，里彭勋爵的继任者约瑟夫·张伯伦下令在行政委员会中增加两名非官方成员。这两名成员将“由总督酌情决定”从立法委员会的非官方成员中选出，“以个人功绩为准”，且“不考虑特定阶级或种族”。直到 1926 年，才有一位华人被任命为行政委员会成员。但鉴于 1894 年的改革运动无意中使华人社区受益，欧洲社区直到第一次世界大战后才再次认真讨论宪政改革。 +
THE ACQUISITION OF THE NEW TERRITORIES
新界的取得
In June 1898, according to the Convention of Peking and “for the proper defence and protection of the Colony,” Britain leased the predominantly rural area between Kowloon and the Shenzhen River from China for ninety-nine years.  +
Around 365 square miles—approximately ten times the size of Hong Kong and Kowloon combined—these New Territories also included some 230 outlying islands, one of them (Lantau) considerably larger than Hong Kong Island.  +
More than eighty thousand people lived in the region.
1898年6月，根据《北京条约》，为了“妥善保卫殖民地”，英国从中国租借了九龙至深圳河之间以乡村为主的地区，租期99年。这片新界面积约365平方英里，大约是香港和九龙总面积的十倍，还包括约230个离岛，其中一个（大屿山）的面积远大于香港岛。当时，该地区居住着超过8万人。 +
Colonial officials and British merchants in Hong Kong had advanced various arguments for taking the New Territories throughout the second half of the nineteenth century.  +
The area would be a buffer zone with China and would provide land for real estate and for housing and training troops.  +
The British government had resisted such calls.  +
Even though proponents of expansion continued to harbor designs of making China into another India, the government had decided by the 1860s against more territorial expansion in China.  +
Most British leaders were convinced that the “China hands” had exaggerated China’s economic potential (by the late 1800s, less than 2 percent of Britain’s exports were to China) or that this potential did not warrant territorial control because goods such as silk and tea could be obtained easily enough without territorial control (more than half of China’s foreign trade was already with Britain).  +
Making China into another India could overstretch British imperial power, and further expansion might lead to China’s being carved up like Africa, which would only hurt free trade.  +
Territorial expansion in China risked provoking other European powers into doing the same—perhaps even into war—and drawing resistance from the United States, which was actively involved in trade and missionary work in China.
在十九世纪下半叶，香港的殖民官员和英国商人提出了各种吞并新界的理由。他们认为，新界可以作为与中国接壤的缓冲区，并提供土地用于房地产开发、驻扎和训练军队。英国政府一直抵制这些呼吁。尽管扩张的支持者仍然怀揣着将中国变成另一个印度的野心，但到了19世纪60年代，英国政府已经决定不再在中国进行领土扩张。大多数英国领导人认为，“中国通”夸大了中国的经济潜力（到19世纪末，英国对中国的出口额不到2%），或者认为这种潜力不足以支撑领土控制，因为丝绸和茶叶等商品即使不控制领土也能轻易获得（中国超过一半的对外贸易已经与英国进行）。将中国变成另一个印度可能会使英国的帝国权力过度扩张，而进一步的扩张可能会导致中国像非洲一样被瓜分，这只会损害自由贸易。在中国的领土扩张可能会激起其他欧洲列强效仿，甚至可能引发战争，并招致美国的抵制，因为美国当时正积极参与在中国的贸易和传教活动。 +
The change in British policy toward the New Territories in the late 1890s reflected growing concerns about the defense of Hong Kong, not so much from China but from the other powers that were now challenging Britain’s supremacy in China.  +
Russia, having expanded rapidly westward in the second part of the nineteenth century, had a stretch of coastal territory in northeastern China.  +
Despite earlier reservations about the value of empire, Germany had also become a colonial power and longed for a port along the Chinese coast.  +
France, which enjoyed considerable influence in southern China after its victory in the Sino-French War (1884–1885), had signed an alliance with Russia in 1893.  +
Although relations with the United States were generally good, the U.S.  +
Navy used Mirs Bay—less than twenty miles northeast of Hong Kong—to conduct its operations in the Philippines during the Spanish-American War.  +
(Mirs Bay was included in the lease of the New Territories, as was Deep Bay, northwest of Hong Kong.)
19世纪90年代末英国对新界政策的转变，反映出其对香港防务日益增长的担忧，这种担忧并非主要来自中国，而是来自其他挑战英国在华霸权的列强。俄国在19世纪下半叶迅速西扩张，在中国东北拥有一片沿海领土。尽管此前对帝国价值有所保留，德国也已成为殖民强国，并渴望在中国沿海获得一个港口。法国在中法战争（1884-1885）胜利后，在中国南方拥有相当大的影响力，并于1893年与俄国结盟。尽管与美国的关系总体良好，但在美西战争期间，美国海军利用位于香港东北不到20英里的米尔斯湾在菲律宾开展军事行动。（米尔斯湾和香港西北部的深湾都包含在租借新界的范围内。） +
Even more important for the change in British policy was the rise of a new Asian power.  +
This was Japan, which emerged victorious from the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895.  +
The Treaty of Shimonoseki showed how much Japan had learned from the Western imperialists.  +
Apart from awarding Japan an indemnity, opening four Chinese ports, and granting Japanese citizens the right to trade and manufacture in China, the treaty gave Japan control of the Liaodong Peninsula in northeastern China (although Germany, France, and Russia forced Japan to return it in exchange for higher reparations), the Pescadores (Penghu) Islands, and the island of Taiwan.
对英国政策转变而言，更为重要的是一个新兴亚洲强国的崛起。这个强国就是日本，它在1894-1895年的甲午战争中取得了胜利。《马关条约》表明日本从西方帝国主义那里学到了多少东西。除了向日本支付赔款、开放四个中国港口、赋予日本公民在中国进行贸易和生产的权利外，该条约还使日本获得了中国东北部的辽东半岛（尽管德国、法国和俄罗斯迫使日本以更高的赔款为条件归还了辽东半岛）、澎湖列岛和台湾岛的控制权。 +
Apart from showing Japan’s new power, the Sino-Japanese War led to the Scramble for Concessions from 1897 to 1899.  +
Although Britain and the United States urged the other powers to maintain an open door and not take more territory in China, in late 1897 Germany occupied Jiaozhou, on the southern part of the Shandong Peninsula in northeastern China, after two German missionaries were killed there.  +
The following year, the Germans leased Jiaozhou for ninety-nine years.  +
In December 1897, Russia occupied Port Arthur and Dalian on the Liaodong Peninsula; the following spring Russia leased the two ports for twenty-five years.  +
Eager not to be left out of the scramble, Britain leased the port of Weihaiwei on the northern part of the Shandong Peninsula.  +
When the French leased Guangzhouwan, near Hainan Island and only two hundred miles from Hong Kong, for ninety-nine years, the British made their move on the New Territories.
除了展现日本的新兴实力外，甲午战争还引发了1897年至1899年的瓜分租界大战。尽管英国和美国敦促列强保持门户开放，不要在中国扩张领土，但在1897年末，两名德国传教士在胶州遇害后，德国占领了位于中国东北山东半岛南部的胶州。次年，德国租借胶州99年。1897年12月，俄国占领了辽东半岛的旅顺和大连；次年春天，俄国租借了这两个港口25年。英国也不甘落后，租借了位于山东半岛北部的威海卫港。当法国租借了位于海南岛附近、距香港仅200英里的广州湾99年后，英国开始在新界扩张势力。 +
Compared with the earlier treaties between Britain and China, the negotiations for the Convention of Peking were remarkably smooth.  +
Although the British hoped for a permanent cession, their chief negotiator and minister in Beijing, Claude MacDonald, assumed that a ninety-nine-year lease would in fact be permanent.  +
The Qing government had been reluctant to lease the region but, like the British government, hoped that conceding a relatively small area so quickly and without fanfare would prevent the other powers from using the British acquisition of the region as a pretext for demanding more concessions.  +
Led by the seasoned statesman and reformer Li Hongzhang, the Qing negotiators had at one point demanded that the British pay rent for leasing the area, but they soon decided against this because it might prove the increasingly loud charges by Chinese nationalists that the Manchus and their Chinese helpers were literally selling out the country.  +
Britain thus got what it had demanded, free of charge and without harming relations with China or the other powers.
与以往英中条约相比，《北京条约》的谈判异常顺利。尽管英国希望永久割让这片土地，但其首席谈判代表兼驻北京公使克劳德·麦克唐纳却认为九十九年的租约实际上就是永久租约。清政府原本不愿租借这片土地，但与英国政府一样，希望如此迅速且低调地割让相对较小的区域，能够防止列强以此为借口，要求更多让步。在经验丰富的政治家和改革家李鸿章的带领下，清方谈判代表一度要求英国支付租约租金，但他们很快放弃了这一要求，因为这可能会印证中国民族主义者日益高涨的指责——满清及其中国盟友实际上是在出卖国家。就这样，英国如愿以偿，既没有付出任何代价，也没有损害与中国或其他列强的关系。 +
Unlike when the British took control of Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, the occupation of the rural New Territories provoked widespread resistance from both sides of the new border, perhaps encouraged by Guangdong authorities.  +
Villagers promptly burned down temporary structures erected by the new colonial administration.  +
In October 1898, the residents of Kam Tin, a village in the northwest, raised a fund to resist the British if they tried to interfere with traditional practices of land ownership.  +
After British troops fired on the village walls, village elders presented the wall gates as a sign of their submission.  +
(Governor Henry Blake quickly had the gates sent back to his home in Ireland, where they remained until 1925.) In the spring of 1899, placards called on villagers to resist the invaders.  +
Although the British had not expected such fervent and well-organized resistance, they had no trouble defeating the several thousand villagers who rose up throughout the region.  +
British forces proceeded to arrest resistance leaders, confiscate weapons, and destroy the gates to village walls.
与英国占领香港岛和九龙时不同，新界农村地区的占领引发了新边界两侧村民的广泛抵抗，这或许是受到广东当局的煽动。村民们迅速烧毁了新殖民政府搭建的临时建筑。1898年10月，西北部锦田村的村民筹集资金，以防英国人干涉传统的土地所有权制度。英军炮击村墙后，村里的长老们将城门献上，以示臣服。（总督亨利·布莱克迅速将城门送回他在爱尔兰的家中，这些城门一直留在那里，直到1925年。）1899年春天，村民们张贴标语，号召他们抵抗侵略者。尽管英国人没有预料到如此热烈且组织严密的抵抗，但他们轻而易举地镇压了该地区数千名起义的村民。英军随后逮捕了抵抗领袖，没收了武器，并摧毁了村墙的城门。 +
Some of this resistance was organized by local leaders who worried that the British regime would threaten the power that their families had enjoyed for several centuries.  +
Other concerns were similar to those that inspired resistance against colonial expansion elsewhere.  +
Villagers feared that the British invaders would impose new taxes, confiscate land, interfere with traditional customs, and disrupt feng shui.  +
Rumors spread that women would be raped.  +
Although the Convention of Peking stipulated that there would be “no expropriation or expulsion of the inhabitants of the district included within the extension” and that any land required for official purposes would be purchased at “a fair price,” the villagers had good reason to believe otherwise.  +
To persuade villagers to sell their land cheaply, the two Chinese members of the Legislative Council, Ho Kai and Wei Yuk—along with other Chinese businessmen—had spread rumors that the British were going to seize all land.  +
Robert Ho Tung, the Eurasian tycoon, had helped the colonial authorities gather information on the region for the takeover.  +
A local investment company had dispatched representatives to purchase land deeds in hopes that the value of the land would increase under British occupation.
部分抵抗是由当地领袖组织的，他们担心英国政权会威胁到他们家族几个世纪以来享有的权力。其他一些担忧则与其他地方反抗殖民扩张的担忧类似。村民们害怕英国侵略者会征收新税、没收土地、干涉传统习俗，甚至破坏风水。谣言四起，说妇女会遭到强奸。尽管《北京条约》规定“不得征用或驱逐扩张区域内的居民”，并且任何用于官方目的的土地都将以“公平的价格”购买，但村民们却有充分的理由相信并非如此。为了说服村民低价出售土地，立法会的两位华人议员何恺明和魏玉以及其他华人商人散布谣言，说英国人将没收所有土地。欧亚大亨何东曾帮助殖民当局收集有关该地区的情报，以便进行占领。当地一家投资公司派出代表购买土地契约，希望在英国占领下土地价值能够上涨。 +
Most of the resistance subsided once the British showed that they had little intention of interfering radically in local life, and the British occupation of the New Territories formally began on April 16, 1899.  +
Here the British applied a form of indirect rule similar to that in other parts of the British Empire, such as West Africa.  +
Governor Blake, who had been governor of the Bahamas, Newfoundland, and Jamaica before arriving in Hong Kong in late 1898, believed that the New Territories could not be governed in the same way as the more urbanized areas of Hong Kong Island and Kowloon.  +
Instead, he intended to run the region as Chinese officials had: by interfering as little as possible except for collecting taxes and relying instead on village elders whenever possible.  +
Blake divided the region into districts and subdistricts, each managed by a committee of village elders charged with maintaining order.  +
The entire area was administered by a British district officer who was in actuality the chief police officer, magistrate, and chief administrative officer.  +
After 1909, the area was divided into two districts, each with its own district officer.  +
Over time, the district officer system expanded, with officers in charge of various parts of the region.  +
This system lasted until after World War II.
随着英国人表明他们无意对当地生活进行大刀阔斧的干预，大部分抵抗逐渐平息。1899年4月16日，英国正式开始占领新界。在这里，英国实行了一种类似于其在西非等其他英属殖民地实行的间接统治方式。布莱克总督在1898年末抵达香港之前，曾任巴哈马、纽芬兰和牙买加的总督。他认为，新界的治理方式与香港岛和九龙等较为城市化的地区截然不同。因此，他打算效仿中国官员的治理方式：除了征税之外，尽可能少地干预当地事务，并尽可能依靠村中长老。布莱克将新界划分为若干区和街道，每个区都由一个负责维护秩序的村中长老委员会管理。整个新界由一名英国地方官员统领，他实际上身兼警务处长、地方法官和行政长官三职。 1909年后，该地区被划分为两个区，每个区都设有一名区长。随着时间的推移，区长制度不断扩展，区长们负责该地区的各个部分。这一制度一直沿用至二战后。 +
Still, the colonial government retained considerable power over the New Territories.  +
For example, the Summoning of Chinese Ordinance of 1899 allowed the registrar general to “enquire into and report as to any matter which is connected with the New Territories...  +
if such matter exclusively concerns persons of Chinese race.” The registrar general could also summon any Chinese person to appear before him for questioning.  +
Despite some reservations, the two Chinese members of the Legislative Council did not oppose the ordinance.  +
Ho Kai explained how he was “quite prepared to sacrifice a certain amount of our liberty with the object of helping the Government to carry out their policy for the good of the Chinese inhabitants of the New Territory.”5 Although a European Legislative Council member argued strongly that the bill gave too much power to the registrar general, Ho demanded only that the ordinance be administered tactfully and discretely and that it be used only temporarily.
尽管如此，殖民政府仍然对新界保留着相当大的权力。例如，1899 年的《传唤华人条例》授权登记总署署长“调查并报告任何与新界有关的事项……如果该事项仅涉及华人”。登记总署署长还可以传唤任何华人到他面前接受讯问。尽管有所保留，立法会的两位华人议员并未反对该条例。何启解释说，他“完全愿意牺牲一定程度的自由，以帮助政府为新界华人谋福祉” 。⁵ 虽然一位欧洲裔立法会议员强烈认为该法案赋予登记总署署长过大的权力，但何启只要求该条例的执行要谨慎周密，并且只能暂时使用。 +
In theory and in practice, most of the New Territories ended up being administered differently from the rest of Hong Kong—not from the benevolence of the colonial government but mainly because the region had been so tightly integrated with the rest of Guangdong province for so long.  +
The region produced numerous administrative hassles for the colonial government, which, confounded by confusing and inconsistent patterns of land ownership, set about resurveying the land.  +
Much of the land was not very fertile (as now, most food in Hong Kong came from China).  +
In the first year or so, the colonial government spent over thirty times more money administering the region than it received in revenue.  +
From the beginning of the British occupation, the region was exempt from many ordinances that applied to Hong Kong, including some dealing with abattoirs and markets, public health, opium, licensing, and registration.  +
Over time, the New Territories came to play an increasingly vital role in Hong Kong’s economy.  +
Nevertheless, many traditional Chinese customs that had begun to fade away in urban Hong Kong and in mainland China—especially after the Communist revolution of 1949—persisted in the rural New Territories well into the 1970s.  +
For example, the practice preventing women from inheriting land remained legal until the 1990s, long after it was abolished on the mainland and on Taiwan.  +
Alexander Grantham, governor from 1947 to 1957, described the New Territories as “almost more Chinese than China itself.”6
无论从理论上还是实践中，新界的大部分地区最终都与香港其他地区有着不同的行政管理方式——这并非出于殖民政府的仁慈，而主要是因为该地区长期以来与广东省其他地区紧密相连。新界给殖民政府带来了诸多行政难题，由于土地所有权混乱且不一致，殖民政府不得不重新勘测土地。当时，新界的大部分土地并不肥沃（正如现在一样，香港的大部分食物都来自中国内地）。在最初的一年左右，殖民政府在新界的行政支出是其收入的三十多倍。从英国占领之初，新界就不受适用于香港的许多法令的约束，其中包括一些关于屠宰场和市场、公共卫生、鸦片、执照和登记等方面的法令。随着时间的推移，新界在香港经济中扮演的角色日益重要。然而，许多在香港城市和中国大陆（尤其是在 1949 年共产党革命之后）开始逐渐消失的传统中国习俗，在新界农村地区却一直延续到 20 世纪 70 年代。例如，禁止女性继承土地的习俗在新界一直合法到 20 世纪 90 年代，远早于大陆和台湾废除该习俗的时间。1947 年至 1957 年担任香港总督的亚历山大·格兰瑟姆曾形容新界“几乎比中国大陆更像中国”。 6 +
A peculiar feature of the Convention of Peking was the exclusion of a Chinese walled garrison that the Qing had expanded substantially after the British occupation of Hong Kong Island and after the cession of Kowloon.  +
According to the convention, the area would remain under Chinese administration “except so far as may be inconsistent with the military requirements for the defence of Hong Kong.” When Qing imperial troops helped villagers resist British rule in the New Territories in 1899, however, the British unilaterally declared the area no longer under Chinese jurisdiction.  +
The area would later become a source of contention between the British and Chinese governments.  +
When the British tried in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1960s to clear the area for sanitary reasons and to resettle the residents, local residents appealed to the respective Chinese governments, which reminded the British that the area was still technically under Chinese jurisdiction.  +
Indeed, the Walled City became such a powerful symbol of Chinese sovereignty in British Hong Kong that patriotic protesters torched the British consulate in Canton in 1948 after the colonial government tried to destroy the city and build a park in its place.  +
Thus, explains writer Jan Morris, the old garrison eventually evolved into “a sort of no man’s land, known simply as the Walled City.  +
The Chinese objected whenever the British proposed to pull the place down; the British never applied to it all their usual municipal regulations, and as late as the 1970s it was said that its only real administration was provided by the Triads.”7
《北京条约》的一个特殊之处在于，它将清政府在英国占领香港岛和割让九龙后大幅扩建的中国围墙驻军排除在外。根据该条约，该地区将继续由中国管辖，“除非与保卫香港的军事需要相冲突”。然而，1899 年，当清军帮助村民抵抗英国在新界的统治时，英国单方面宣布该地区不再属于中国管辖。此后，该地区成为英中两国政府争论的焦点。20 世纪 30 年代、40 年代和 60 年代，英国试图以卫生为由清理该地区并重新安置居民，但当地居民向中国政府提出申诉，中国政府则提醒英国，该地区在法律上仍然属于中国管辖。事实上，九龙城寨在英属香港时期已成为中国主权的有力象征，以至于 1948 年，在殖民政府试图拆除城寨并在此建造公园后，爱国示威者焚毁了英国驻广州领事馆。作家简·莫里斯解释说，因此，这片旧驻军区最终演变成“一片无人区，简称为九龙城寨”。每当英国人提出拆除城寨的计划时，中国人都会提出反对；英国人从未将他们通常的市政法规应用于城寨，甚至到了 20 世纪 70 年代，据说城寨的唯一真正管理权仍然掌握在三合会手中。 7 +
In the long run, the Convention of Peking that leased the New Territories to the British was, in the word of historian Steve Tsang, “a major blunder for British diplomacy.”8 The convention left unresolved issues that would eventually hurt the same colony it was designed to protect.  +
Although the convention leased the region to Britain, the permission to extend British jurisdiction came from the Royal Order in Council of October 20, 1898, according to which the New Territories formally became part of the colony of Hong Kong.  +
Because the order stipulated that British jurisdiction last only as long as the ninety-nine-year lease, British jurisdiction would expire on June 30, 1997.  +
The region became more closely linked with the rest of Hong Kong, especially after the Communist revolution of 1949, by which time Britain was no longer in a position to seek any revisions to the convention.  +
By signing the convention, the British had not ensured the future of Hong Kong; rather, they had made “an appointment with China.” Eighty years later, they would have to keep this appointment by beginning negotiations with a new, much more powerful Chinese government.  +
This time, they would not be successful.
从长远来看，将新界租借给英国的《北京条约》，正如历史学家曾志伟所言，是“英国外交的一大败笔”。 8 该条约遗留了一些悬而未决的问题，最终损害了它原本旨在保护的殖民地。尽管该条约将新界租借给了英国，但英国扩大管辖权的许可却来自 1898 年 10 月 20 日的枢密院令，根据该令，新界正式成为香港殖民地的一部分。由于该令规定英国的管辖权仅限于 99 年的租期，因此英国的管辖权将于 1997 年 6 月 30 日到期。新界与香港其他地区的联系日益紧密，尤其是在 1949 年共产党革命之后，此时英国已无力再对该条约进行任何修改。英国签署该条约，并非确保了香港的未来；相反，他们只是与中国“约定”了未来。八十年后，他们不得不再次履行承诺，与一个实力远胜于现在的中国政府展开谈判。但这一次，他们不会成功了。 +
THE RISE OF THE HONG KONG CHINESE BOURGEOISIE
香港华人资产阶级的崛起
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, a new class of Chinese businessmen and professionals began to emerge in Hong Kong, which had become the center of a Chinese capitalist expansion that ranged from China to Southeast Asia.  +
Apart from controlling trade with China and Southeast Asia, Chinese began to dominate the industrial sector of Hong Kong’s economy.  +
In the late 1880s and 1890s the colony received a new group of immigrants in the form of overseas Chinese from Australia, Canada, and the United States—the result of restrictive immigration laws introduced by the British Dominions and by the American Exclusion Acts of 1887.  +
Political instability in China supplied a steady influx of wealthy Chinese immigrants, who brought with them new capital, entrepreneurial skills, and valuable business connections.  +
By the early 1900s, Chinese also owned the most real estate in Hong Kong.  +
The completion of the Kowloon-Canton Railway in 1910 linked Hong Kong with Chinese and international markets, helping local industrialists import and export raw materials and manufactured goods.
19世纪末20世纪初，香港涌现出一批新的华人商人和专业人士。当时，香港已成为中国资本主义扩张的中心，其版图从中国大陆延伸至东南亚。除了掌控与中国大陆和东南亚的贸易外，华人也开始主导香港经济的工业部门。19世纪80年代末90年代，由于英国自治领地实施的限制性移民法以及1887年美国《排华法案》的影响，香港迎来了一批新的移民群体，他们主要来自澳大利亚、加拿大和美国。中国的政治动荡也促使大量富裕的华人移民涌入香港，他们带来了新的资本、创业技能和宝贵的商业人脉。到20世纪初，华人已拥有香港最多的房地产。1910年九广铁路的建成通车，将香港与中国大陆及国际市场连接起来，极大地促进了本地实业家进出口原材料和制成品。 +
The rising economic status of the Chinese bourgeoisie was also evident in the growth of consumer culture and conspicuous consumption.  +
Department stores such as the Sincere Company, founded in 1900 by Ma Ying Piu, a Chinese who had made his fortune in Australia, and the Wing On Department Store, founded in 1907 by the Kwok brothers, who had also made their money in Australia, signaled the growth of a bourgeois Chinese commercial culture.  +
Here, Chinese shoppers could purchase almost anything they desired—Cuban cigars, Italian felt hats, American razors, French champagne, Swiss chocolate, American gramophones, Japanese robes made from Chinese silk, and English suits, shoes, and cigarettes.  +
With the improved economic status came an increase in cohesiveness and organization, enhanced by the emergence of a new group of retailers, bankers, and industrialists in the early years of the twentieth century.  +
New organizations represented the interests of the Chinese business community, such as the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, founded in 1896 by prominent merchants and compradors.
中国资产阶级经济地位的提升也体现在消费文化和炫耀性消费的兴起上。例如，由在澳大利亚发迹的华人马英彪于1900年创立的信安百货公司，以及由同样在澳大利亚积累财富的郭氏兄弟于1907年创立的永安百货公司，都标志着中国资产阶级商业文化的兴起。在这些百货公司里，华人顾客几乎可以买到任何他们想要的东西——古巴雪茄、意大利毡帽、美国剃须刀、法国香槟、瑞士巧克力、美国留声机、用中国丝绸制成的日本和服，以及英国西装、皮鞋和香烟。随着经济地位的提高，社会凝聚力和组织性也随之增强，而20世纪初新兴的零售商、银行家和实业家群体则进一步强化了这一趋势。新的组织代表了华人商业界的利益，例如中华总商会，它由著名商人和买办于 1896 年创立。 +

Despite their status and wealth, the members of the Chinese bourgeoisie, like all Chinese in Hong Kong, continued to face racial discrimination at every turn.  +
Racial segregation was enforced both legally and informally.  +
In 1901 a group of Europeans petitioned the colonial government for a separate school for Europeans, arguing that integrated education harmed the morality and character of European children.  +
Although one Chinese resident complained in the local press that “to exclude Chinese from certain schools means to go against the law of nature and to aggravate the hatred between Chinese and foreigners”9 and Secretary for the Colonies Chamberlain condemned the proposal, it enjoyed great support among European parents and the colonial government.  +
Ironically, the new school, the Kowloon British School, had originally been built and presented to the colonial government by the Eurasian Robert Ho Tung as a school for all races.  +
Ho Tung now reluctantly agreed, regretting a decision “so opposed to the spirit which prompted my offer of the school to the Colony.”10 Chinese were barred from the Hong Kong Club and the Hong Kong Jockey Club, and in some hotels Chinese guests could stay only in certain rooms or could not stay overnight.
尽管地位显赫、家境富裕，但香港的中国资产阶级成员，如同所有华人一样，处处遭受种族歧视。种族隔离既有法律层面的，也有非正式的。1901 年，一群欧洲人向殖民地政府请愿，要求设立一所专门为欧洲人设立的学校，他们认为融合教育会损害欧洲儿童的道德和品格。尽管一位华人居民在当地报刊上抱怨说，“将华人排除在某些学校之外，违背了自然规律，加剧了华人与外国人之间的仇恨”，殖民地事务大臣张伯伦也谴责了这一提议，但它却得到了欧洲家长和殖民地政府的大力支持。具有讽刺意味的是，这所新学校——九龙英国学校——最初是由欧亚混血儿何东捐建并赠予殖民地政府的，当时的设想是一所面向所有种族的学校。何东如今勉强同意了，并对这一决定感到后悔，称其“与我当初向殖民地捐赠这所学校的初衷背道而驰”。 10 名中国人被禁止进入香港俱乐部和香港赛马会，一些酒店的中国客人只能入住特定房间或不能过夜。 +
A particularly visible example of this government-enforced racial divide was Victoria Peak, the exclusive hill district on Hong Kong Island where no Chinese, except for the servants, cooks, houseboys, and drivers working for Europeans, were to live.  +
In 1902 this residential segregation became law when the Colonial Office allowed the Peak to be used solely by residents approved by the governor.  +
Subsequent ordinances passed in 1904 and 1918 explicitly barred Chinese and Eurasians from living on the Peak.  +
As in India and other British colonies, Europeans in Hong Kong worried that close contact with Chinese posed serious physiological and moral risks.  +
Most Europeans in Hong Kong believed that the fate of the colony depended on the health of its European population.  +
Amid the fears of increased contact with Chinese and rising economic competition from the Chinese bourgeoisie, these restriction movements were attempts to preserve the status and social structure of the elite European community of Hong Kong.
政府强制推行种族隔离的一个显著例子是太平山顶。这座位于香港岛的专属山地住宅区，除了为欧洲人工作的仆人、厨师、男仆和司机外，任何华人都不得居住于此。1902年，殖民地事务部允许只有总督批准的居民才能使用太平山顶，这一居住隔离制度由此正式生效。随后，1904年和1918年颁布的法令明确禁止华人和欧亚混血儿居住在太平山顶。如同在印度和其他英国殖民地一样，香港的欧洲人担心与华人密切接触会带来严重的生理和道德风险。大多数在港欧洲人认为，殖民地的命运取决于其欧洲居民的健康状况。在担忧与华人接触增多以及来自中国资产阶级日益激烈的经济竞争的背景下，这些限制措施旨在维护香港欧洲精英阶层的地位和社会结构。 +
How did Chinese and Eurasians in Hong Kong respond to the racial discrimination that was so prevalent in Hong Kong? Irene Cheng, Robert Ho Tung’s daughter, insisted that the Peak District Bill of 1918, which prohibited non-Europeans from living on the Peak, was “bitterly resented by the Chinese and other Asian residents of Hong Kong.”11 But the Chinese members of the Legislative Council did not oppose the Peak ordinance, and only during the general strike of 1925–1926 was there a demand that Chinese be allowed to live on the Peak.  +
And even this demand came from the strike organizers, who could hardly have afforded to live on the Peak even had they been allowed to do so.  +
In 1919, a similar ordinance reserved part of the island of Cheung Chau as a vacation reserve for British and American missionaries.  +
This time, however, the Chinese members of the Legislative Council objected.  +
Lau Chu Pak expressed his surprise and disappointment that even missionaries could behave in such a manner, while Ho Fook, Robert Ho Tung’s brother, condemned the bill as little more than “racial legislation.” A few Chinese were permitted by the Executive Council to live on that section of the island in the 1930s, but the Peak and Cheung Chau ordinances were not repealed until 1946.
在香港，华人和其他亚裔居民如何应对当时普遍存在的种族歧视？何东的女儿郑若骅坚称，1918 年的《山顶条例》禁止非欧洲人居住在太平山顶，这“令香港华人和其他亚裔居民深感愤慨”。 11 但立法会的华人议员并未反对这项山顶条例，直到 1925-1926 年的大罢工期间，才有人要求允许华人居住在太平山顶。而即便这一要求也来自罢工组织者，他们即便获准居住在太平山顶，也难以负担得起那里的生活。1919 年，一项类似的条例将长洲岛的一部分划为英国和美国传教士的度假区。然而，这一次，立法会的华人议员提出了反对意见。刘柱柏对传教士竟有如此行径表示震惊和失望，而何福（何东的兄弟）则谴责该法案不过是“种族立法”。20 世纪 30 年代，行政会议允许少数华人居住在岛上的这一区域，但山顶和长洲的法令直到 1946 年才被废除。 +

For the most part, wealthy Chinese and Eurasians responded to racial discrimination by creating their own exclusive social world.  +
These leaders often considered themselves members of a special class, distinct from the rest of the local Chinese population and from their counterparts in China.  +
In March 1901, for example, a group of Chinese elites asked Governor Blake to establish a special school exclusively for their own children.  +
The signatures on the petition belonged to some of Hong Kong’s most prominent Chinese residents.  +
Ho Kai was a barrister, physician, financier, and unofficial member of the Legislative Council.  +
Wei Yuk, a close friend of Ho Kai and one of the first Chinese to study in Britain, was an unofficial Legislative Council member, comprador to the Mercantile Bank of India, and former chairman of the Tung Wah Hospital.  +
Tso Seen Wan was a prominent solicitor educated in England.  +
The petitioners argued that “the indiscriminate and intimate mingling of children from families of the most various social and moral standing” rendered the existing government schools “absolutely undesirable as well as unsuitable for the sons and daughters of respectable Chinese families.” Although some members of the Chinese community objected, the new school was built the next year.
大多数情况下，富裕的华人和欧亚混血儿通过建立自己的专属社交圈来应对种族歧视。这些领袖人物往往认为自己属于一个特殊的阶层，与当地其他华人以及中国大陆的华人截然不同。例如，1901年3月，一群华人精英请求布莱克总督为他们的孩子设立一所专门的学校。请愿书上的签名者包括一些香港最杰出的华人居民。何佳是一位大律师、医生、金融家，也是立法会的非正式成员。魏玉是何佳的密友，也是最早赴英留学的华人之一，他曾是立法会的非正式成员、印度商业银行的买办，以及东华医院的前任主席。曹善云是一位在英国接受教育的著名律师。请愿者认为，“来自社会和道德地位迥异的家庭的孩子们不加区分地混杂在一起”，使得现有的公立学校“对于体面的华人家庭的子女来说，既不理想也不合适”。尽管一些华人社区成员表示反对，但新学校还是在第二年建成。 +
The leaders of the Hong Kong Chinese bourgeoisie also established several exclusive clubs and associations to enhance and perpetuate their elite status.  +
Barred from the Hong Kong Club, several prominent Chinese and Eurasians formed their own club in 1899: the Chinese Club.  +
Among the founders were the Eurasian brothers Robert Ho Tung and Ho Kam Tong.  +
Another founder, Kwan Sun Yin, was one of the first Chinese practitioners of Western medicine in Hong Kong.  +
Membership and directorship were restricted to some of the most prominent Chinese and Eurasian businessmen and professionals in Hong Kong.  +
Another elite club was the Chinese Recreation Club, founded in 1912 by Ho Kai, Wei Yuk, and several other prominent Chinese.  +
Apart from enjoying such British sports and games as cricket, tennis, and billiards, members could practice Chinese martial arts or play mah-jongg.  +
Even more important than the sports were the institutions and functions surrounding them.  +
As in the British clubs, the Chinese Recreation Club’s screening process was rigorous, and membership fees were high.  +
Club rules were strict, and proper cricket and tennis whites were required.  +
The club’s directors and members were some of the best-known Chinese and Eurasian men of the colony.
香港华人资产阶级领袖还建立了一些精英俱乐部和协会，以提升和巩固其精英地位。由于被香港俱乐部拒之门外，几位杰出的华裔和欧亚裔人士于1899年成立了自己的俱乐部：华人俱乐部。创始人包括欧亚裔兄弟何东和何锦堂。另一位创始人关顺贤是香港最早的西医从业者之一。俱乐部的会员资格和董事职位仅限于香港一些最杰出的华裔和欧亚裔商人和专业人士。另一个精英俱乐部是华人娱乐俱乐部，由何佳、魏玉和其他几位华人于1912年创立。除了享受板球、网球和台球等英国体育运动外，会员还可以练习中国武术或打麻将。比体育运动本身更重要的是围绕这些运动而建立的机构和活动。与英国俱乐部一样，华人娱乐俱乐部的筛选程序非常严格，会员费也很高。俱乐部规章制度十分严格，要求穿着标​​准的板球和网球白色服装。俱乐部的董事和成员都是当时殖民地最知名的华裔和欧亚混血人士。 +
HONG KONG AND CHINESE NATIONALISM
香港与中国民族主义
Historians have often stressed Hong Kong’s contributions to China’s nation-building in the late 1800s and early 1900s.  +
Graduates of local schools such as the Central School served widely in the Chinese Civil Service and the Imperial Chinese Maritime Customs.  +
Other Hong Kong-educated Chinese ended up working in China as teachers, doctors, scientists, and engineers.  +
Local entrepreneurs invested heavily in commercial and industrial activities in southern China and donated to charitable, educational, public works, and medical projects in their native districts.  +
Hong Kong was also the main remittance center for southern China, handling more than 50 percent of the money remitted to China by overseas Chinese.
历史学家经常强调香港在19世纪末20世纪初对中国建国的贡献。中央学校等本地学校的毕业生广泛服务于中国公务员系统和海关。其他在香港接受教育的华人最终在中国从事教师、医生、科学家和工程师等职业。本地企业家大力投资中国南方的商业和工业活动，并向家乡的慈善、教育、公共工程和医疗项目捐款。香港也是中国南方的主要汇款中心，处理了海外华人汇往中国的资金的50%以上。 +
Many Chinese in Hong Kong also participated in nationalist boycotts such as the Anti-American Boycott of 1905–1906.  +
Throughout the 1880s and early 1890s, the American government issued a series of exclusion acts prohibiting Chinese workers from entering the United States, but other Chinese in America were also the targets of discrimination and violence.  +
In July 1905, a Chinese who had been arrested without a warrant by immigration officers in Boston committed suicide in front of the American consulate in Shanghai.  +
This led to a massive boycott of American goods in China.  +
Although many local Chinese business leaders opposed the boycott on the grounds that it would hurt Hong Kong’s economy, teachers, students, journalists, and merchants kept it going.  +
Some stores refused to carry American goods.  +
Chinese newspapers publicized the progress of the boycott, refused to take advertisements for American goods, and listed the names of merchants who sold American goods.  +
Sedan-chair carriers and rickshaw pullers refused to carry visiting American Secretary of War William Taft (who, weighing more than three hundred pounds, would have been a very heavy load indeed) and his entourage.  +
A group of wealthy Chinese merchants, including Li Yuk Tong, who had started his career in California, formed the Society to Oppose the American Exclusion Treaties Against Chinese Laborers.
许多在港华人也参与了民族主义抵制运动，例如1905-1906年的反美抵制运动。19世纪80年代和90年代初，美国政府颁布了一系列排华法案，禁止中国劳工进入美国，而身处美国的华人也遭受歧视和暴力。1905年7月，一名在波士顿被移民官员无逮捕令逮捕的华人，在上海美国领事馆前自杀身亡。这引发了中国大规模的抵制美国商品运动。尽管许多香港华人商界领袖反对抵制，认为这会损害香港经济，但教师、学生、记者和商户仍然坚持不懈地进行抵制。一些商店拒绝销售美国商品。中文报纸报道了抵制运动的进展，拒绝刊登美国商品的广告，并公布了销售美国商品的商家名单。轿夫和人力车夫拒绝运送来访的美国陆军部长威廉·塔夫脱（他体重超过三百磅，确实是个不小的负担）及其随行人员。一群富有的华人商人，包括早年在加利福尼亚创业的李玉堂，成立了反对美国排华条约协会。 +
A similar display of Chinese nationalism was the Anti-Japanese Boycott, which lasted from March to December 1908.  +
After the Japanese government forced the Chinese government to apologize for seizing the Tatsu Maru II, a Japanese freighter that had been smuggling arms and munitions into Guangdong, Chinese in Canton protested this national humiliation by boycotting Japanese goods.  +
Organized mainly by local merchants, the Hong Kong boycott was even more extensive than the one in Canton.  +
Merchants who violated the boycott faced fines, while the Dare to Die Society threatened to kill and slice off the ears of Chinese merchants who broke the boycott.  +
In early November, rioters attacked shops that sold Japanese goods.  +
Although the boycotters did not attack any Japanese companies, the colonial government had to protect Japanese firms.  +
After the colonial police shot two Chinese rioters, arrested at least one hundred more, and banished the boycott leaders without trial, Chinese firms protested by stopping business for two weeks; others withdrew large sums from the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank.  +
Worried that the crackdown would hurt trade by panicking the Chinese population, the European business community persuaded the government to ease up on the arrests.  +
When Japanese exports to Hong Kong dropped by more than one-quarter, the Japanese vice-consul tried to patch up relations with the Chinese business leaders.  +
The boycott ended by January 1909, although it was revived later that year in protest against the expansion of Japanese influence in northeastern China.
类似的中国民族主义体现是 1908 年 3 月至 12 月的抗日运动。日本政府强迫中国政府就扣押“ 辰丸二号”—— 一艘向广东走私武器弹药的日本货轮——一事道歉后，广州的华人以抵制日货的方式抗议这一民族耻辱。香港的抵制运动主要由当地商人组织，规模甚至比广州的还要大。违反抵制令的商人面临罚款，而“敢死队”则威胁要杀害并割掉违反抵制令的中国商人的耳朵。11 月初，暴徒袭击了销售日货的商店。尽管抵制者没有袭击任何日本公司，但殖民政府不得不保护日本企业。殖民警察枪杀了两名中国暴徒，逮捕了至少一百多人，并将抵制运动的领导人未经审判就驱逐出境后，中国企业以停业两周的方式进行抗议；另一些企业则从香港上海汇丰银行提取了大量资金。由于担心镇压行动会引发中国民众恐慌，从而损害贸易，欧洲商界人士劝说政府放松逮捕力度。当日本对香港的出口下降超过四分之一时，日本副领事试图修复与中国商界领袖的关系。抵制行动于 1909 年 1 月结束，但同年晚些时候，由于抗议日本势力在中国东北地区的扩张，抵制行动再次兴起。 +
Hong Kong’s colonial situation also enabled it to play an important role in the 1911 revolution, which toppled the Qing dynasty and established the Republic of China.  +
Sun Yat-sen, who is celebrated throughout the Chinese world as the “father of the nation,” was educated partly in Hong Kong, first at the Central School and later at the College of Medicine.  +
Although the government was eager to prevent Hong Kong from becoming a center for subversion, the colony served as a base for recruiting and training Chinese revolutionaries.  +
Here Sun established a local branch of the Revive China Society, which he had founded earlier as a student in Honolulu.  +
The United League, a revolutionary group founded by Sun in Tokyo in 1905, was also active in Hong Kong.  +
In a free port with easy access to arms and munitions from Japan and the West, Sun and his revolutionaries were able to organize a range of clandestine activities.  +
The first revolutionary uprising in Canton in 1895 was orchestrated from Hong Kong, as was the second uprising, which occurred in 1900 in Huizhou—only ten miles from the New Territories.  +
An aborted uprising scheduled for January 1903 outside Canton was also partly planned in Hong Kong.  +
The colony was home to a host of local organizations that supported the revolutionaries, while local Chinese businessmen offered financial support for the movement.
香港的殖民地地位也使其在1911年推翻清朝、建立中华民国的辛亥革命中发挥了重要作用。被誉为“国父”的孙中山先生曾在香港接受教育，先是在中央学校，后进入香港医学院。尽管政府极力阻止香港成为颠覆中心，但香港仍成为招募和训练中国革命者的基地。孙中山先生在此建立了复兴中国协会的香港分会，该协会是他早年在檀香山求学时创立的。孙中山先生于1905年在东京创立的革命组织“联合同盟”也在香港积极活动。香港作为自由港，武器弹药可以便捷地从日本和西方获得，这使得孙中山先生及其革命者得以组织一系列秘密活动。 1895年广州的第一次革命起义是由香港策划的，1900年发生在徽州（距新界仅十英里）的第二次起义也是如此。原定于1​​903年1月在广州郊外爆发的一次起义，部分策划工作也在香港完成。香港拥有众多支持革命者的本地组织，而当地的华人商人也为这场运动提供了资金支持。 +
Given Hong Kong’s relatively wide freedom of the press, revolutionary newspapers such as the China Daily—published in Hong Kong and distributed to overseas Chinese communities—could not only debate more conservative newspapers advocating less radical reforms for China but could even openly call for revolution.  +
Hong Kong also served as a sanctuary for Chinese reformers and revolutionaries.  +
Sun Yat-sen took refuge there after the failed 1895 uprising.  +
When the moderate reformer Kang Youwei fled to Hong Kong with help from British authorities after the aborted Hundred Days of Reform in the summer of 1898, he was initially protected by the colonial government.  +
Yang Quyun, a leader of the Revive China Association, was allowed to take refuge in Hong Kong after the 1900 uprising.  +
Embarrassed and outraged when Qing agents assassinated Yang in 1901, colonial authorities provided police protection to Chen Shaobai, another revolutionary, and gave him a permit to carry a gun for self-defense.
鉴于香港相对宽松的新闻自由，像《 中国日报》 这样的革命报纸——在香港出版并发行到海外华人社区——不仅可以与主张对中国进行较为温和改革的保守报纸展开辩论，甚至可以公开呼吁革命。香港也成为了中国改革派和革命者的避难所。孙中山在 1895 年起义失败后曾在此避难。1898 年夏天，温和派改革家康有为在百日改革失败后，在英国当局的帮助下逃往香港，最初受到殖民政府的保护。1900 年起义后，复兴中国协会的领导人杨屈云获准在香港避难。1901 年，清政府官员刺杀杨屈云，令殖民当局感到羞愧和愤怒，于是为另一位革命者陈少白提供警察保护，并允许他持枪自卫。 +
Like colonial governments elsewhere, the Hong Kong government inadvertently helped to encourage the growth of Chinese nationalism.  +
Eager not to encourage anti-Manchu or revolutionary feelings, the government did not include recent Chinese history in local schools.  +
By including topics such as parliamentary government, however, the colonial educational curriculum encouraged students to think about politics in ways that helped shape their political consciousness.  +
Furthermore, students in schools such as the Central School were exposed to teachers and students of different nationalities and backgrounds, and the school library had works from all over the world.  +
In a speech at the University of Hong Kong in 1923, Sun Yat-sen declared that he had developed his revolutionary ideas “entirely in Hong Kong.” The extreme contrast between the peace and order in Hong Kong and the disorder and corruption in China, Sun explained, had made him a revolutionary.  +
“I began to wonder how it was that foreigners, that Englishmen, could do such things as they had done, for example, with the barren rock of Hong Kong, within 70 or 80 years, while China, in 4,000 years, had no places like Hong Kong.” (Sun did not mention this part, but, having observed the anti-French strikes of 1884, he knew that Hong Kong would provide a favorable environment for his revolutionary activities.)
与其他地方的殖民政府一样，香港政府无意中助长了中国民族主义的兴起。为了避免激起反满或革命情绪，政府并未在当地学校教授近代中国历史。然而，通过引入议会制政府等主题，殖民时期的教育课程鼓励学生以独特的视角思考政治，从而塑造了他们的政治意识。此外，像中央学校这样的学校的学生有机会接触到来自不同国家和背景的师生，学校图书馆也藏书丰富，涵盖世界各地。1923年，孙中山在香港大学的演讲中宣称，他的革命思想“完全是在香港形成的”。孙中山解释说，香港的和平与秩序与中国大陆的混乱与腐败形成了鲜明的对比，正是这种对比促使他走上了革命之路。 “我开始纳闷，为什么外国人，尤其是英国人，能在短短七八十年内，把香港这片贫瘠的土地变成现在这样的地方，而中国四千年来却从未有过像香港这样的地方。”（孙中山没有提及这一点，但他目睹了1884年的反法罢工，知道香港将为他的革命活动提供有利的环境。） +
Although the official government policy toward the Chinese revolutionaries was one of neutrality, the colonial government had to walk a very narrow tightrope.  +
Like most Chinese in Hong Kong, it supported political change in China.  +
The colonial government was under orders from the British government not to let Hong Kong become a base for subversion, but it could not afford to alienate its Chinese subjects by clamping down on revolutionary activities (although in 1907 it passed the Chinese Publications Ordinance, aimed at preventing Hong Kong from becoming a bastion of anti-Qing sentiment).  +
Thus, in March 1896 Governor Robinson rejected a request by Canton authorities to extradite one of Sun’s followers.  +
Nor did the government try to close down revolutionary groups such as the Revive China Association.  +
In March 1896, however, Robinson ordered that Sun, en route from a fund-raising trip in Hawaii, be banished from Hong Kong for five years.  +
Robinson insisted that the Hong Kong government would not allow the colony “to be used as an Asylum for persons engaged in plots and dangerous conspiracies against a friendly neighbouring Empire.”12
尽管香港政府对中国革命者的官方政策是中立的，但殖民政府必须小心翼翼地走钢丝。和大多数在港华人一样，他们支持中国的政治变革。殖民政府奉英国政府之命，不得让香港成为颠覆活动的基地，但又不能因镇压革命活动而疏远其华人臣民（尽管 1907 年通过了《中国出版物条例》，旨在防止香港成为反清情绪的堡垒）。因此，1896 年 3 月，总督罗宾逊拒绝了广州当局引渡孙中山追随者的请求。政府也没有试图取缔诸如兴中华会之类的革命团体。然而，1896 年 3 月，罗宾逊下令将孙中山驱逐出香港五年，当时他正结束在夏威夷的筹款之旅返回香港。罗宾逊坚称，香港政府绝不会允许该殖民地“被用作从事阴谋和危险阴谋活动、危害友好邻邦帝国的人员的庇护所”。 12 +
Sun’s banishment became an embarrassment to both the Hong Kong and British governments in 1897, when Qing agents kidnapped him in London and temporarily imprisoned him in the Chinese legation.  +
He was saved only after a friend from Hong Kong, James Cantlie, who had been dean of medicine at the College of Medicine, intervened with the Foreign Office on his behalf.  +
After a British soldier leaked the banishment case to the local press, the press and British politicians demanded to know why Sun was a political refugee in Britain yet did not enjoy the same rights in a British colony.  +
In the end, Chamberlain ruled that because Sun had left before the banishment order was issued, the order could remain in effect.  +
When moderate Kang Youwei returned to Hong Kong in October 1899, the Qing government demanded that he be expelled for plotting against the Qing government.  +
As Governor Blake explained that Kang had not been causing any trouble, the British Foreign Office rejected the Qing government’s request.  +
By December of the same year, however, the Foreign Office had decided that allowing Kang to remain in Hong Kong might lead other powers to accuse Britain of encouraging rebellion in China.  +
The Foreign Office diplomatically suggested that Kang go to Singapore, on the grounds that he would be safer there.
1897 年，孙中山被清政府特工在伦敦绑架，并被暂时囚禁于香港使馆，此事令香港和英国政府都感到尴尬。幸亏一位香港朋友，曾任香港医学院院长的詹姆斯·坎特利（James Cantlie）出面向英国外交部求情，孙中山才得以获救。一名英国士兵将孙中山的流放事件泄露给香港当地媒体后，英国媒体和政界人士纷纷质问，为何孙中山在英国是政治难民，却在英国殖民地无法享有同等权利。最终，张伯伦裁定，由于孙中山是在流放令颁布前离开香港的，因此该命令仍然有效。1899 年 10 月，温和派人士康有为返回香港后，清政府要求将其驱逐出境，理由是他密谋反对清政府。由于布莱克总督解释说康有为并未制造任何麻烦，英国外交部驳回了清政府的请求。然而，到了同年 12 月，外交部认为允许康德荣留在香港可能会导致其他国家指责英国支持中国境内的叛乱。外交部以外交辞令建议康德荣前往新加坡，理由是他在那里会更安全。 +
There are, however, good reasons not to overemphasize the role of Hong Kong in the growth of Chinese nationalism.  +
As historian Chan Lau Kit-ching argues, concern with events in China was “lukewarm” at best.13 Revolutionary publications were all very short-lived, and the activities of the Hong Kong branch of the United League were neither as extensive nor as effective as they are often described in revolutionary accounts that portray Hong Kong as a breeding ground for revolution.  +
Nor was Hong Kong involved in organizing the 1911 revolution itself.  +
The influence of newspapers such as the China Daily was also quite small.  +
And the Revive China Association lost much of its vigor after the failed uprisings of 1895 and 1900.  +
Rather, what appears to have evolved in Hong Kong was a kind of conservative Chinese nationalism that was shaped by Hong Kong’s status as a British colony.
然而，我们有充分的理由不去过分强调香港在中国民族主义发展中的作用。正如历史学家陈刘洁清所言，当时香港人对中国局势的关注充其量只能算是“不冷不热”。 13 革命刊物都昙花一现，香港联合同盟的活动也远没有革命史中描述的那样广泛和有效，这些革命史往往将香港描绘成革命的温床。香港本身也没有参与组织 1911 年革命。像《 中国日报》 这样的报纸的影响力也相当有限。而复兴中国协会在 1895 年和 1900 年的起义失败后也失去了活力。相反，在香港发展起来的似乎是一种受其英国殖民地地位影响的保守的中国民族主义。 +
Consider the experience of Ho Kai, who was part of a small group of reformers that arose in Hong Kong and the treaty ports and is credited with influencing the political ideas of Sun Yat-sen.  +
On the one hand, men like Ho Kai—born and educated in Hong Kong—saw themselves as members of a privileged group, in not only Hong Kong but also the greater Chinese world and the British Empire.  +
Yet, like many Chinese inside and outside of China, they became increasingly concerned about the fate of their ancestral homeland.  +
The son of a Protestant minister, land speculator, and merchant, Ho embodied a nationalism that was inseparable from the colonial situation in which he lived.  +
He was educated entirely in British schools, both in Hong Kong and in Britain.  +
He received his early education at the Central School, and then went to Britain for training in both medicine and law.
何佳的经历值得我们思考。他是香港及通商口岸涌现的一小群改革者之一，对孙中山的政治思想产生了影响。一方面，像何佳这样在香港出生和接受教育的人，认为自己属于特权阶层，不仅在香港，而且在整个华人世界和英帝国都是如此。然而，与许多身处中国境内外的华人一样，他们也越来越关注祖籍国的命运。何佳的父亲是一位基督教牧师、土地投机商和商人，他身上体现的民族主义与他所处的殖民地环境密不可分。他完全接受的是英式教育，无论是在香港还是在英国。他早年在中央学校接受教育，之后前往英国学习医学和法律。 +
Ho returned in 1882 to Hong Kong, where after running a short-lived medical practice, he began his career as barrister at law and, like his father, invested in real estate and local businesses.  +
He also developed a distinguished career in public service.  +
In 1890 he was appointed as the Chinese unofficial member of the Legislative Council.  +
He was the main founder of the Alice Memorial Hospital (named after his deceased wife, Alice Walkden, whom he had married while in England) and of the College of Medicine, where he taught physiology and medical jurisprudence.  +
He was also a member of the advisory committees of the Po Leung Kuk and the Tung Wah Hospital, meaning that he was a government appointee and not elected by the Chinese themselves.  +
For his services to the colony and the British Crown, he was made a Companion of the Order of St.  +
Michael and St.  +
George in 1892 and was knighted in 1912.
何鸿燊于1882年返回香港，短暂行医后，开始了他的律师生涯，并像他的父亲一样投资房地产和本地商贸。他还在公共服务领域取得了卓越的成就。1890年，他被任命为立法会华人非官议员。他是爱丽丝纪念医院（以其在英国期间结婚的已故妻子爱丽丝·沃克登的名字命名）和医学院的主要创办人，并在医学院教授生理学和法医学。他还是保良局和东华医院顾问委员会的成员，这意味着他是政府委任的，而非由华人选举产生。由于他对殖民地和英国王室的贡献，他于1892年被授予圣米迦勒及圣乔治勋章，并于1912年被册封为爵士。 +
Inspired by liberal thinkers such as John Locke, Adam Smith, Jeremy Bentham, and John Stuart Mill, Ho saw British rule as liberating rather than oppressive.  +
He believed that Hong Kong could be a commercial and political model for China and that, like Britain, China should be a constitutional monarchy with people’s rights.  +
He was proud of Hong Kong, which he considered more prosperous and politically stable than any Chinese city, its government less corrupt and repressive and its education and civil service systems better than anything China had to offer.  +
Hong Kong represented the best of two worlds: Chinese entrepreneurship encouraged and protected by British free trade and liberal government.  +
Just as commerce had made Hong Kong more prosperous and stable than China, the cure for China would also be commerce, supported by British liberalism and parliamentary government.  +
With his friend Hu Liyuan, Ho expressed this belief in a series of political treatises that were later published in 1900 in a six-volume work called the True Meaning of New Government.
受约翰·洛克、亚当·斯密、杰里米·边沁和约翰·斯图亚特·密尔等自由主义思想家的启发，何鸿燊认为英国的统治是解放而非压迫。他相信香港可以成为中国的商业和政治典范，并且像英国一样，中国应该是一个拥有人民权利的君主立宪制国家。他为香港感到自豪，认为香港比中国任何城市都更加繁荣、政治稳定，其政府更加廉洁、镇压更少，其教育和公务员制度也优于中国的任何制度。香港代表着两个世界的优势：既有英国自由贸易和自由政府鼓励和保护的中国企业家精神。正如商业使香港比中国更加繁荣稳定一样，中国也应依靠商业，并辅以英国的自由主义和议会制政府。何鸿燊与好友胡立元共同撰写了一系列政治论著，阐述了这一信念。这些论著后来于 1900 年出版，共六卷，名为 《新政府的真谛》。 +
Ho was involved with the revolutionary movement at the turn of the century and played an important role in the history of the Revive China Society.  +
Along with several other local Chinese merchants, he helped finance the society’s newspaper, the China Daily.  +
He also helped organize the aborted 1895 uprising in Canton.  +
During the planning of the Huizhou uprising in 1900, he tried to use his connections with the Hong Kong English press on behalf of Sun Yat-sen’s rebels to obtain British aid or at least ensure a friendly Hong Kong government (under pressure from the Foreign Office, the colonial government allowed Qing troops to pass through Hong Kong territory to suppress the uprising).  +
Although Ho’s involvement with the revolutionary movement declined greatly after the 1900 uprising, as did his attempts to act as a middleman between the Chinese revolutionaries and the Hong Kong government, his concern for Chinese affairs was not diminished.  +
Rather, Ho, who believed that China should be a constitutional monarchy like England instead of a republic, had come to believe that the republican ideas of Sun and his revolutionaries were too radical.  +
Still, Ho would remain committed to the welfare of China for the rest of his life.  +
He is still regarded as an influential reformer.  +
One historian has called his writings “a symbolic turning point” in the Chinese reform movement.14
何鸿燊在世纪之交积极参与革命运动，并在兴中华会的历史上扮演了重要角色。他与其他几位香港华商共同资助了该会的报纸《 中国日报》 。他还参与组织了 1895 年广州起义，但最终以失败告终。1900 年徽州起义期间，何鸿燊试图利用其在香港英文报刊的人脉，为孙中山的起义者争取英国援助，或至少确保香港政府对他们友好（在英国外交部的压力下，殖民政府允许清军经香港镇压起义）。尽管 1900 年起义后，何鸿燊参与革命运动的程度大幅下降，他作为中国革命者和香港政府之间中间人的努力也随之减少，但他对中国事务的关注却丝毫未减。相反，何鸿燊认为中国应该像英国一样实行君主立宪制，而不是共和制，因此他认为孙中山及其革命者的共和思想过于激进。尽管如此，何鸿燊终其一生都致力于中国的福祉。他至今仍被视为一位极具影响力的改革家。一位历史学家称他的著作是中国改革运动的“象征性转折点”。 14 +
THE 1911 REVOLUTION AND ITS EFFECTS ON HONG KONG
1911年革命及其对香港的影响
On October 10, 1911, units of the Qing government’s New Army based in the city of Wuchang seized the local munitions depot.  +
After similar mutinies in two other neighboring cities, Wuchang declared itself independent of the Qing dynasty.  +
This sparked a rash of defections, with ten provinces declaring their independence in two weeks and others seceding one after another from the Qing.  +
The rebels established the Chinese Republic on January 1, 1912, with the capital at Nanjing and Sun Yat-sen as provisional president.
1911年10月10日，驻扎在武昌的清政府新军部队占领了当地的军火库。随后，邻近的两座城市也相继发生类似起义，武昌宣布脱离清朝独立。这引发了一波叛乱浪潮，两周内有十个省份宣布独立，其他省份也相继脱离清朝。1912年1月1日，起义军建立了中华民国，定都南京，孙中山先生为临时总统。 +
The 1911 revolution aroused Chinese of all classes in Hong Kong.  +
Governor Frederick Lugard wrote that the news of the revolution was received with “the most amazing outburst which has ever been seen and heard in the history of the Colony....  +
The entire Chinese populace appeared to have been temporarily demented with joy.”15 On October 18, 1911, four hundred people marched on the local offices of the Bank of China and a promonar-chy newspaper, forcing both to remove the Qing imperial flag.  +
Businessmen such as Ma Ying Piu and Li Yuk Tong formed the East Canton Red Cross Society to provide medicine and personnel for those wounded in the revolution.  +
The Tung Wah Hospital collected food for war refugees.  +
Students and merchants raised money to support the rebels.  +
Barbers cut queues (the Manchu hairstyle imposed on all men within the empire) for free, while patriotic prostitutes announced that they would donate half of their profits to the revolutionary cause.  +
Hong Kong also became a haven for former Qing officials after the revolution.  +
Here these officials and their families became a sort of displaced aristocracy, building Chinese-style villas, listening to music, composing poetry, and playing mah-jongg.
1911 年的革命唤醒了香港各阶层的华人。总督弗雷德里克·卢加德写道，革命的消息传来时，出现了“殖民地历史上前所未见的惊人爆发……全体华人似乎都欣喜若狂，一时失去了理智。” 1911 年 10 月 18 日， 四百人游行至中国银行香港分行和一家君主制报社，迫使两家机构撤下清朝旗帜。马英彪、李玉堂等商人成立了东粤红十字会，为革命伤员提供药品和人员。东华医院为战争难民募集食物。学生和商贩筹款支持起义军。理发师免费为清朝男子理发（清朝强制所有男子留的满族发型），爱国妓女宣布将捐出一半收入用于革命事业。革命后，香港也成为清朝前官员的避难所。这些官员及其家属在这里形成了一种流亡贵族的氛围，他们建造中式别墅，听音乐，作诗，打麻将。 +
Although the revolutionaries, eager to keep the foreign powers neutral, discouraged antiforeign sentiments, many Chinese in Hong Kong felt that since the Manchus had been driven out of China, the British should be next.  +
Colonial authorities discovered factories for making bombs, and civil unrest erupted throughout the colony.  +
Crowds looted shops, threw stones at the police and at the governor when he appeared in public, and tried to rescue prisoners in jail.  +
Europeans rushed to purchase firearms after some were attacked on the streets.  +
The police made so many arrests that the prison authorities had to release some prisoners before they had finished their terms.  +
In July 1912, a young Chinese man tried to assassinate the new governor, Francis May.  +
While the assassination attempt does not appear to have been connected with any political plot, it nevertheless revealed the tensions that the revolution had provoked in Hong Kong.
尽管革命者为了保持外国列强的中立，竭力压制反外情绪，但许多香港华人认为，既然满清已被逐出中国，英国人也应该被赶走。殖民当局发现了制造炸弹的工厂，整个殖民地爆发了骚乱。民众抢劫商店，向警察和公开露面的总督投掷石块，并试图营救狱中的囚犯。一些欧洲人在街头遭到袭击后，纷纷抢购枪支。警方逮捕了许多人，以至于监狱当局不得不提前释放一些囚犯。1912年7月，一名年轻的华人试图刺杀新任总督弗朗西斯·梅。虽然这次刺杀未遂事件似乎与任何政治阴谋无关，但它仍然揭示了革命在香港引发的紧张局势。 +
Partly because it was confined mainly to the lower classes of Hong Kong and partly because the new Canton government publicly disapproved of it, this civil unrest was short-lived.  +
Although they supported the revolution, the Chinese elites of Hong Kong were determined not to let it harm Hong Kong’s economic and political stability.  +
Shortly after the revolution, Ho Kai and Wei Yuk, the two Chinese unofficial members of the Legislative Council, voted for an amendment to the Peace Preservation Ordinance authorizing the flogging of rabble-rousers in the local jail.  +
In 1912 the registrar general reported that although the “excitement bred of the Revolution” in China and an “unintelligent passion for politics” had posed an “element of danger” and “opportunity for the unscrupulous,” the “unostentatious work of the gentlemen” on the District Watch Committee “helped in no small degree the observance of the Colony’s regulations and the keeping of the peace.”16 Still, the wake of the revolution left the colonial government anxious about revolutionary activities in China and Hong Kong.  +
In 1913, Governor May pushed through his Education Bill, which required all private schools to register with the government.  +
Although May claimed that his intention was to improve the standard of education in these schools, his correspondence with the Colonial Office shows that he was trying to keep schools from becoming centers for anti-British propaganda.  +
The Seditious Publications Ordinance of 1914 was aimed at any publications that might undermine the stability of Hong Kong or China.
这场骚乱部分原因是其主要局限于香港的下层阶级，部分原因是新成立的广州政府公开反对，因此持续时间很短。尽管香港的华人精英支持革命，但他们决心不让革命损害香港的经济和政治稳定。革命后不久，立法会两位华人非官方议员何佳和魏玉投票赞成修改《治安条例》，授权在当地监狱鞭打煽动者。1912 年，总登记官报告称，尽管中国“革命带来的激动情绪”和“对政治的盲目热情”构成了“危险因素”和“不法之徒的可乘之机”，但地区治安委员会“各位先生的默默工作”“在很大程度上促进了殖民地规章的遵守和治安的维护”。 16 然而，革命的余波令殖民政府对中国内地和香港的革命活动感到担忧。1913 年，梅总督强行通过了《教育条例》，要求所有私立学校向政府登记。尽管梅声称其目的是为了提高这些学校的教育水平，但他与殖民地事务部的往来信件表明，他试图阻止学校成为反英宣传的中心。1914 年的《煽动性出版物条例》旨在禁止任何可能破坏香港或中国稳定的出版物。 +
The 1911 revolution is known throughout the Chinese world as a glorious page in the annals of Chinese history.  +
Like most revolutions, however, it caused as many problems as it solved.  +
Yuan Shikai, the army commander who replaced Sun as president in March 1912, was unable to hold the young republic together.  +
Although Yuan was committed to preserving order and unity and to modernizing China, he was equally committed to maintaining his own power.  +
In 1913 he assassinated the leader of the Nationalist Party and suppressed a second republican revolution led by Sun in five breakaway provinces.  +
The following year Yuan abolished the provincial assemblies.  +
In 1915 he declared himself emperor of the Chinese Empire after being convinced by an American political scientist that China was not ready for democracy.  +
Even before Yuan died in 1916, power in China had begun to flow outward into the hands of warlords or military leaders, who emerged as the new power brokers.  +
China remained politically fragmented until the late 1920s.
1911年辛亥革命被整个华人世界视为中国历史上光辉的一页。然而，如同大多数革命一样，它带来的问题与解决的问题一样多。1912年3月接替孙中山担任国家主席的袁世凯，这位陆军统帅却无力维系这个年轻的共和国。尽管袁世凯致力于维护秩序和统一，并推动中国现代化，但他同样也致力于巩固自身权力。1913年，他刺杀了国民党领袖，并镇压了孙中山在五个分离省份领导的第二次共和革命。次年，袁世凯废除了省议会。1915年，在一位美国政治学家的劝说下，袁世凯认为中国尚未做好接受民主的准备，于是宣布自己为中华帝国皇帝。甚至在袁世凯1916年去世之前，中国的权力就已经开始向军阀或军事领导人手中转移，他们成为了新的权力掮客。中国的政治分裂局面一直持续到20世纪20年代末。 +
The failure of the 1911 revolution to make China a stable republic had two important effects for Hong Kong.  +
By 1913, many Chinese in Hong Kong had lost their enthusiasm for Sun Yat-sen, who was largely ignored when he visited in June that year.  +
Indeed, both the Hong Kong government and the local Chinese elites welcomed Yuan Shikai’s suppression of Sun’s second revolution.  +
The 1911 revolution had simply caused too much trouble: refugees poured in from China by the day, and by 1914 the population had reached half a million.  +
The revolution also radically changed Hong Kong’s political relations with China.  +
Because the government in Beijing ruled China only in name, the Hong Kong government had to deal directly with a succession of regimes in Canton, several of which tried to undermine Hong Kong’s political and economic stability.  +
Yet because the British Foreign Office continued to recognize whoever was in charge of Beijing as the rightful government of China, this often led to friction between the Foreign Office and the Hong Kong government.
1911年辛亥革命未能使中国成为一个稳定的共和国，这对香港产生了两个重要影响。到1913年，许多香港华人对孙中山失去了热情，他在当年6月访问香港时也几乎无人理睬。事实上，香港政府和当地华人精英都对袁世凯镇压孙中山的第二次辛亥革命表示欢迎。辛亥革命造成的麻烦实在太多：每天都有难民从中国大陆涌入，到1914年，香港人口已达50万。辛亥革命也从根本上改变了香港与中国的政治关系。由于北京政府名义上统治中国，香港政府不得不直接与广州的多个政权打交道，其中一些政权试图破坏香港的政治和经济稳定。然而，由于英国外交部仍然承认北京的执政者是中国的合法政府，这常常导致英国外交部与香港政府之间的摩擦。 +
THE TRAM BOYCOTT OF 1912–1913
1912-1913年的电车抵制运动
The Tram Boycott of 1912–1913 showed how dramatically the political changes in revolutionary China could affect Hong Kong.  +
In April 1912, the Hong Kong government banned the circulation of Chinese coins.  +
The economies of Canton and Hong Kong had been intertwined since the early days of the colony, and Chinese coins had been used in Hong Kong since then.  +
As conditions in Guangdong deteriorated after the 1911 revolution, however, the colonial government became worried about the effects of an influx of depreciated Chinese coins from Guangdong.  +
Many Chinese in Hong Kong took the ban as an insult to the new Chinese republic.  +
In November of the same year, Governor May encouraged the Star Ferry Company and the colony’s two tramways to stop accepting Chinese coins.  +
This caused even more resentment among the Chinese population because the shortage of Hong Kong coinage in comparison to Chinese left local residents with less money for their tram fare.  +
When a colony-wide boycott broke out, its organizers used various means to intimidate those who violated the boycott.
1912-1913年的电车抵制运动展现了革命时期中国的政治变革对香港产生的巨大影响。1912年4月，香港政府禁止流通中国硬币。自香港建国初期，广州和香港的经济就紧密相连，香港也一直使用中国硬币。然而，随着1911年辛亥革命后广东局势的恶化，殖民政府开始担忧大量贬值的中国硬币从广东涌入香港会带来不利影响。许多香港华人将这项禁令视为对新成立的中华民国的侮辱。同年11月，梅总督鼓励天星小轮公司和香港的两条电车线路停止接受中国硬币。这进一步激起了华人民众的不满，因为香港硬币的短缺导致当地居民支付电车车费的钱财减少。当全港范围内的抵制运动爆发时，组织者采取了各种手段恐吓违反抵制的人。 +
In December 1912, May encouraged prominent Chinese to help end the boycott.  +
He insisted that the tram companies’ decision not to accept Chinese currency was purely an economic move and was not intended to insult China and that the boycott would only hurt both Hong Kong and China since so much Chinese capital was invested in the tram companies.  +
On December 20, during a meeting at the Chinese Commercial Union, Ho Kai and Wei Yuk, both unofficial Legislative Council members, defended the tram companies and condemned the boycott for harming the economies of both Hong Kong and Guangdong.  +
A weakened Hong Kong economy, they argued, would mean that Hong Kong residents would have less money to help their kin in Guangdong.  +
With help from local Chinese merchants, the boycott ended by early February 1913.  +
Although several of the Chinese who collaborated with the government to end the boycott received threatening letters, May was disappointed by the lack of influence that the more prominent Chinese now seemed to have over the Chinese population.  +
He was particularly annoyed that Ho Kai and Wei Yuk had waited so long to help end the boycott.  +
Indeed, Ho’s failure to help the government earlier was part of the reason he was not reappointed to a fifth term on the Legislative Council.  +
Nevertheless, the defeat of the boycott boosted the government’s authority.
1912年12月，梅鼓励一些华人名流协助结束抵制活动。他坚称，电车公司拒绝接受人民币纯粹是出于经济考量，并非意在侮辱中国，而且由于大量中国资本投资于电车公司，抵制只会损害香港和中国。12月20日，在中华商会的一次会议上，何佳和魏玉两位立法会非官方议员为电车公司辩护，并谴责抵制活动损害了香港和广东的经济。他们认为，香港经济疲软意味着香港居民将无力资助在广东的亲属。在当地华人商人的帮助下，抵制活动于1913年2月初结束。尽管一些与政府合作结束抵制活动的华人收到了恐吓信，但梅对华人名流如今似乎对华人民众缺乏影响力感到失望。他尤其恼火何恺明和魏玉迟迟不肯出手相助结束抵制运动。事实上，何恺明未能早些协助政府，正是他未能连任立法会议员第五届的原因之一。尽管如此，抵制运动的失败还是提升了政府的权威。 +
THE UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG
香港大学
It was shortly after the 1911 revolution that the first university was established in Hong Kong.  +
The driving force behind the university was Lugard, governor from 1907 to 1912.  +
Best known in British imperial history for his system of indirect rule in Africa, whereby indigenous rulers retained power under the supervision of a British resident, Lugard came up with the idea of a university only five months after arriving in Hong Kong.  +
The only tertiary school at the time was the Hong Kong College of Medicine, established in 1887.
1911年革命后不久，香港第一所大学成立。推动这所大学建立的是1907年至1912年担任香港总督的卢加德。卢加德在英国殖民史上最广为人知的，是他推行的非洲间接统治制度——即当地统治者在英国驻港官员的监督下保留权力。卢加德抵达香港仅五个月后，便萌生了建立一所大学的想法。当时香港唯一的高等学府是成立于1887年的香港医学院。 +
Getting the money for the new university was no small feat and reveals concerns about radicalism and higher education in Hong Kong, both locally and in Britain.  +
Hormusjee Mody, a Parsee merchant who was later knighted for his generosity and his service to the British Crown, offered almost eighteen thousand pounds to start the building and a generous endowment.  +
Already reluctant to contribute to an institution in which they would have no supervisory role, however, many Chinese elites were concerned that students who attended universities abroad often returned to Hong Kong imbued with radical ideas.  +
The local British business community was even more hesitant, dismissing Lugard’s plan to establish “the Oxford and Cambridge of the Far East” as simply another example of “the university fad” that was so strong in Britain and the colonies.  +
As Lugard wrote to his wife Lady Lugard (a prominent journalist named Flora Shaw), “the money-grabbing traders fear that if we educate the Chinaman he may become a serious rival.”17 The Colonial Office called the idea of a university “Sir Frederick’s pet lamb,” and some officials in London feared that providing purely secular education would promote antiforeignism and radicalism.
为这所新大学筹集资金绝非易事，这也反映出香港本地和英国对激进主义和高等教育的担忧。一位名叫霍姆斯吉·莫迪（Hormusjee Mody）的帕西族商人，因其慷慨解囊和对英国王室的贡献而被授予爵位，他捐赠了近 18000 英镑用于启动建设，并提供了一笔丰厚的捐赠基金。然而，许多华人精英原本就不愿资助一所他们无法参与管理的机构，他们担心在海外求学的学生往往会带着激进思想回到香港。香港本地的英国商界人士则更加犹豫不决，他们认为卢加德建立“远东的牛津剑桥”的计划不过是英国及其殖民地盛行的“大学热潮”的又一例证。正如卢加德写给妻子卢加德夫人（一位名叫弗洛拉·肖的著名记者）的信中所说：“那些唯利是图的商人担心，如果我们教育华人，他们可能会成为我们强大的竞争对手。” 17 殖民地事务部称建立大学的想法是“弗雷德里克爵士的宠儿”，伦敦的一些官员担心，提供纯粹的世俗教育会助长反外主义和激进主义。 +
Eventually the necessary funds were raised.  +
Ng Li Hing, a local Chinese merchant, donated money for the anatomy building.  +
A Chinese merchant from the Straits Settlements contributed to the arts faculty.  +
The Eurasian Robert Ho Tung later endowed a chair in surgery.  +
Only after Lady Lugard began to canvass their London headquarters, however, did the local British merchant community agree to contribute.  +
Butterfield and Swire made a large donation of forty thousand pounds, mainly to prevent a boycott of their company after one of their ticket collectors had been accused of kicking an elderly Chinese to death.  +
Whereas the Beijing and Canton governments each sent twenty-five thousand pounds, the British government was especially stingy, sending a paltry three hundred pounds to be used for the King Edward VII Scholarships.
最终，所需的资金筹集到位。当地华人商人吴立兴捐款修建了解剖学大楼。一位来自海峡殖民地的华人商人为文学院捐款。欧亚混血儿何东后来捐赠设立了外科教席。然而，直到卢加德夫人开始游说伦敦总部，当地英国商界才同意捐款。巴特菲尔德和太古集团捐赠了四万英镑，主要是为了避免因一名检票员被指控将一位华人老人踢死而遭到抵制。北京和广州政府分别捐赠了两万五千英镑，而英国政府却格外吝啬，只捐赠了区区三百英镑，用于设立爱德华七世国王奖学金。 +
The University of Hong Kong officially opened on March 11, 1912, with approximately seventy students from Hong Kong, Canton, and the other treaty ports and as far as the Straits Settlements (women were not admitted until 1921, and only after a struggle).  +
In 1917 the editor of a local English-language newspaper wrote that “commercially, industrially, and educationally the colony of Hongkong, a mere spot on the map, is keeping the lamp of British traditions and high standards burning in far-off East Asia, and is also passing on the light.” However, Lugard’s dream of the University of Hong Kong becoming the Oxford and Cambridge of East Asia never quite materialized.  +
Despite hopes that the university would attract students from the mainland, Japanese universities and those run by American missionaries in China remained far more popular.  +
Only after World War II would the university truly fulfill its potential.
香港大学于1912年3月11日正式开学，当时约有70名学生，他们来自香港、广州和其他通商口岸，甚至远至海峡殖民地（直到1921年才开始招收女生，而且过程颇为曲折）。1917年，一家本地英文报纸的编辑写道：“香港这片地图上微不足道的殖民地，在商业、工业和教育领域，都在遥远的东亚地区传承着英国的传统和高标准，并将之传递下去。”然而，卢加德希望香港大学成为东亚的牛津和剑桥的梦想最终未能实现。尽管人们曾寄希望于香港大学能够吸引来自中国大陆的学生，但日本大学和美国传教士在中国开办的大学仍然更受欢迎。直到二战之后，香港大学才真正发挥出其应有的潜力。 +
HONG KONG AND WORLD WAR I
香港与第一次世界大战
Hong Kong was not directly involved in the hostilities of World War I, and there was no real military threat at any point, although between sixty thousand and one hundred thousand Chinese residents sought temporary refuge in Guangdong out of fear that the colony might be attacked.  +
Nor, with the exception of inflation and restrictions on certain goods, did the war pose a serious economic threat.  +
The deflection of European trade from Asia helped local Chinese firms.  +
Chinese entrepreneurs benefited from the departure of approximately one-quarter of the colony’s European men for the war front, moving into businesses dominated by Europeans such as banking and shipping.  +
Older and smaller Chinese industries, such as camphor wood, preserved ginger, rattan, soap, soy sauce, tobacco, and vermilion, continued to develop, but they no longer remained the primary focus for Chinese industrialists.  +
The most serious problems during the war were not even related to the war: a disastrous fire at the Happy Valley race track in February 1918 left more than six hundred dead and four hundred wounded, and an outbreak of cerebrospinal meningitis in the crowded Chinese tenements later that year killed more than one thousand people.  +
The war did, however, affect the European community significantly, for all German women and children were repatriated, the men interned until the end of the war.
香港并未直接卷入第一次世界大战的战事，也从未面临真正的军事威胁。尽管有六万至十万中国居民因担心殖民地可能遭到攻击而暂时迁往广东避难。除了通货膨胀和某些商品的管制外，战争并未对香港的经济构成严重威胁。欧洲贸易从亚洲转移，反而有利于香港本地华人企业的发展。约四分之一的香港欧洲男性奔赴前线，华人企业家从中受益，纷纷进入此前由欧洲人主导的行业，例如银行业和航运业。樟木、姜片、藤条、肥皂、酱油、烟草和朱砂等传统规模较小的中国产业仍在发展，但已不再是华人实业家的主要关注点。战争期间最严重的问题甚至与战争本身无关：1918年2月，跑马地赛马场发生灾难性火灾，造成六百多人死亡，四百多人受伤；同年晚些时候，拥挤的华人公寓爆发脑脊髓膜炎，导致一千多人死亡。然而，战争确实对欧洲社会产生了重大影响，所有德国妇女儿童都被遣返回国，而男性则被拘禁至战争结束。 +
Like the rest of the empire, Hong Kong played a role in the British war effort.  +
Almost 25 percent of British males volunteered for war service, and a large number of Chinese workers served in the Chinese Labour Corps in France.  +
Both the Chinese and European communities raised money by subscribing to war charities.  +
Chinese property owners agreed to an additional rate assessment of 7 percent, which raised more than two million Hong Kong dollars in the last two years of the war.  +
Robert Ho Tung, the Eurasian tycoon, donated the cost of two airplanes and several ambulances to the British government.  +
Chau Siu Ki, a Chinese insurance and shipping magnate and real estate developer, served on the War Charities Committee.
与英帝国其他地区一样，香港也为英国的战争努力做出了贡献。近四分之一的英国男性志愿参军，大量华人劳工在法国的中国劳工队服役。华人社区和欧洲社区都通过捐款支持战争慈善事业。华人业主同意额外缴纳7%的物业税，在战争的最后两年筹集了超过两百万港元。欧亚混血富豪何东向英国政府捐赠了两架飞机和数辆救护车的费用。华人保险、航运巨头兼房地产开发商周兆基也曾担任战争慈善委员会委员。 +
The formal end of World War I in July 1919 brought the entire Hong Kong community together in celebration, marked with fireworks, motorcades and parades, lanterns, and Allied flags.  +
A mile-long parade organized by the Chinese business community went from Happy Valley to Central District, with lanterns shaped like various forms of animals and culminating with a great dragon at the end.  +
So many people came from Guangdong to watch the festivities that the trams had to be suspended.  +
One week after the victory celebrations, however, rice riots broke out—the first such activities that the colony had seen for many years.  +
Although the riots ended soon, they nevertheless foreshadowed some of the events that would affect Hong Kong in the 1920s.
1919年7月，第一次世界大战正式结束，整个香港举国欢庆，燃放烟花，举行车队游行，悬挂灯笼和盟军旗帜。由华人商界组织的游行队伍绵延一英里，从跑马地一路行至中环，沿途灯笼造型各异，最后以一条巨龙的造型收尾。由于大量民众从广东赶来观看庆祝活动，电车不得不暂停运营。然而，胜利庆典一周后，香港爆发了稻米暴动——这是多年来香港首次发生此类事件。尽管暴动很快平息，但它预示着20世纪20年代将对香港产生重大影响的一些事件。 +
