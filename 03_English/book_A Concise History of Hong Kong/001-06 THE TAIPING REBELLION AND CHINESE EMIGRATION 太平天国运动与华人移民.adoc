Not only did many Chinese show their affiliation with Hong Kong by disobeying orders from Canton to return to China during the Second Opium War, but the local Chinese population also greatly expanded during this period.  +
And even though racial antagonisms and mutual suspicions between the Chinese and European populations increased during the war, the expansion of the Chinese community would eventually help make Hong Kong a major trading center.  +
This expansion occurred not because of the colonial government’s attempt to attract wealthier Chinese to Hong Kong but because of the combination of Chinese domestic turmoil and the worldwide rise of Western capitalism and imperialism, which encouraged Chinese emigration in two ways.
在第二次鸦片战争期间，许多华人不仅违抗广州的命令返回中国，以此表达他们对香港的认同，而且香港华人人口也在此期间大幅增长。尽管战争期间华人与欧洲人之间的种族敌对和相互猜忌加剧，但华人社区的扩张最终使香港成为重要的贸易中心。这种扩张并非殖民政府试图吸引富裕华人移居香港的结果，而是中国国内动荡局势与西方资本主义和帝国主义在全球范围内的崛起共同作用的结果，这从两个方面促进了华人移民。 +

《南京条约》开放广州及其他通商口岸，扰乱了当地经济。英国棉花等进口商品开始与中国产品在广州市场展开竞争，而中国帆船则败给了更大、更快的外国船只。到19世纪40年代末50年代初，广州失去了对茶叶和丝绸贸易的控制权，导致广东各地失业率居高不下。几乎与此同时，英国、法国和美国部分地区废除奴隶制，刺激了加拿大、美国、澳大利亚、新西兰以及西印度群岛和东印度群岛对廉价强迫劳动力的需求。1849年加利福尼亚发现金矿后，第一批中国劳工经香港前往美国。到1850年12月，已有两千名中国人离开中国前往加利福尼亚。1850年1月至6月间，约一万吨货物在香港装船或部分装船，运往美国西海岸。随着海外贸易的增长，也带来了新的中国劳动力和人才。 1850年，邦纳姆总督报告说，华人人口有所增加，主要是来自广州的工匠，他们在加利福尼亚从事贸易。三年后，他指出，该殖民地的“商业前景正在缓慢但稳步地扩展，并呈现出更加持久的特征”。 +

Hong Kong’s economic recovery began in the early 1850s, when many Chinese merchants came to Hong Kong to escape the Taiping Rebellion.  +
In 1837, Hong Xiuquan, a Chinese from Guangdong who had failed the civil service examination, had a nervous breakdown.  +
Years later, after failing the examination a fourth time and reading Christian tracts produced by Protestant missionaries, he became convinced that he was the second son of Jehovah and the younger brother of Jesus Christ.  +
He had been ordered to oust the Manchu “imps and demons” from China and to establish the Taiping Kingdom, or “Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace.” When Hong and his Society of God Worshippers started proselytizing in Guangxi province, an area outside of government control and teeming with secret societies that claimed their loyalty to the Ming dynasty, their crusade gained a political edge.  +
Armed with an ideology based on quasi-Christian beliefs, the abolition of private property and the institution of a communal land system, the segregation of men and women, and strict prohibitions against liquor, tobacco, and opium, Hong’s rebels moved northeast from Guangxi and through the middle Yangzi Valley.  +
In 1853 they captured Nanjing, renaming the city the “Heavenly Capital” and making it their capital for more than ten years.  +
The rebellion might have ended the Qing dynasty were it not eventually suppressed in 1864 by provincial armies led by Chinese commanders, along with help from Western munitions and mercenaries.
香港的经济复苏始于19世纪50年代初，当时许多中国商人为了躲避太平天国运动而来到香港。1837年，一位名叫洪秀全的广东人，因科举落榜而精神崩溃。多年后，他第四次科举落榜，并阅读了基督教传教士制作的小册子，深信自己是耶和华的次子，耶稣基督的弟弟。他奉命将满清的“妖魔鬼怪”驱逐出中国，建立太平天国，即“天国大和平”。当洪秀全和他的“神敬会”开始在广西传教时，由于广西当时处于政府控制之外，且充斥着许多自称效忠明朝的秘密社团，他们的传教活动逐渐获得了政治意义。洪氏起义军以准基督教信仰为基础，主张废除私有财产，建立公有土地制度，实行男女隔离，并严格禁止酒、烟、鸦片等消费。他们从广西出发，向东北方向进发，途经长江中游。1853年，他们攻占南京，将这座城市改名为“天都”，并以此为都城长达十余年。若非最终在1864年被中国将领率领的地方军队，以及西方军火和雇佣兵的援助镇压，这场起义或许会终结清朝的统治。 +

The Taiping Rebellion   and its suppression 镇压；平定 cost (v.) at least twenty million lives, devastated 彻底破坏；摧毁 parts of the Chinese countryside, and wiped out (v.) entire cities.  +

`主` Those _who could afford (v.) to do so_ `谓` *fled 逃离；逃跑 to* the safety of the treaty ports 通商口岸, especially to Shanghai, protected by its large Western settlement 租界；定居点.  +

The Taiping Rebellion and its suppression cost at least twenty million lives, devastated parts of the Chinese countryside, and wiped out entire cities.  +
Those who could afford to do so fled to the safety of the treaty ports, especially to Shanghai, protected by its large Western settlement.  +
Although the rebellion fueled tensions in Hong Kong, it also helped pull the colony out of its economic slump.  +
From 1853 to 1859 the Chinese population of Hong Kong rose from approximately forty thousand to around eighty-five thousand, even with the mass departures during the Second Opium War.  +

When journalist Wang Tao first arrived in Hong Kong, “merchants generally wore short jackets and put on a cotton overcoat when the weather got cold.  +

People are beginning to pursue luxury....  +
Bright lamps burn through the night, and loud music is heard until the small hours.  +
Hong Kong’s prosperity now exceeds that of Canton, and it is all the result of fate and chance.”
太平天国运动及其镇压造成至少两千万人丧生，摧毁了中国部分乡村，并夷平了整座城市。有能力的人纷纷逃往通商口岸寻求庇护，尤其是受西部商站保护的上海。尽管太平天国运动加剧了香港的紧张局势，但也帮助香港摆脱了经济衰退。1853 年至 1859 年间，香港的华人人口从约四万人增长到约八万五千人，即便是在第二次鸦片战争期间经历了大规模人口外流之后，这一数字依然保持稳定。官员和来访者经常提到，中国动荡的局势为香港带来了新的商人，并提高了当地居民的生活水平。记者王涛初到香港时，“商人们通常穿着短袄，天气转凉时才穿上棉袄。妇女们则不太注重穿着打扮。”但他后来观察到，“香港的生活方式正在发生剧烈的变化。人们开始追求奢华……灯火通明，音乐声响彻夜空。香港的繁荣程度如今超过了广州，而这一切都是命运和机遇的结果。” 26 +

The combination of the Taiping Rebellion, Chinese emigration, and the growth of overseas Chinese communities 海外华人社群 had three important effects on Hong Kong’s economy.  +

太平天国运动、华人移民潮以及海外华人社区的壮大，对香港经济产生了三大重要影响。首先，它将香港从一个殖民地前哨转变为一个跨国华人贸易网络的中心，该网络从中国沿海延伸至东南亚，甚至远至澳大利亚和美洲。其次，太平天国运动和海外华人社区的兴起，也催生了香港一个新的富裕阶层，他们不再是过客，而是定居者。这些新移民中不乏富裕的华人，他们带来了家人、资本、商业技能和人脉。例如，李氏兄弟于19世纪50年代初从广东来到香港。1857年，他们成为最大的劳工中介和移民船承租人。到19世纪60年代中期，他们的家族产业涵盖保险、房地产以及鸦片垄断。作为这个成功家族的掌门人，李星成为香港最杰出的商人之一。随着这些人的到来，到 19 世纪 50 年代末，香港殖民地出现了一个新的华人商业精英阶层。 +

最终，香港的经济增长惠及了当地的欧洲商人，并吸引了新的外国投资。19 世纪 50 年代末至 60 年代初，多家新的欧洲银行相继成立。美国和葡萄牙公司也从广州和澳门迁至香港。1857 年，苏格兰人道格拉斯·拉普雷克（Douglas Lapraik）在香港以钟表匠学徒的身份起家，后来与人合伙创办了香港第一家干船坞。到 1869 年去世时，他已拥有七艘蒸汽船。香港与广州、美国和澳大利亚之间的航运也日益繁忙。1864 年 7 月香港上海汇丰银行的成立，最能体现外国投资者对香港经济信心的增强。在此之前，香港的银行业务主要由规模较大的欧洲银行提供。当时，香港和中国的大多数西方银行都是英印银行的分支机构，例如东方银行和印度、澳大利亚和中国特许银行——这些汇兑银行由印度或英国控制。新银行的成立被视为殖民地繁荣的标志。中国资本从一开始就至关重要，这家银行也很快发展成为中国沿海地区首屈一指的银行。由于当时香港没有正式的中央银行，香港上海汇丰银行在殖民时代的最后几年里一直扮演着香港中央银行的角色。到 20 世纪末，它已成为世界上最大的金融机构之一。 +
