Although Hong Kong was a British colony and a predominantly Chinese city, like the treaty ports that dotted the coast and waterways of China and like most cities in the British Empire it was multiethnic from the start.  +
In addition to the British and the Chinese, there were Eurasians, Indians, Portuguese from Macau, Jews from Bombay, other Europeans, Armenians, and Americans.  +
As in most colonial dual cities, these communities lived in two main areas from the earliest days, with European businesses and residences claiming the better land and Chinese settling mainly in small huts along the beach and on the overlooking hillsides.  +
Governor Bowring lamented in September 1858 that “the separation of the native population from the European is nearly absolute; social intercourse between the races is wholly unknown.”
尽管香港是英国殖民地，且以华人为主，但如同中国沿海和水道沿岸的通商口岸以及大英帝国的大多数城市一样，它从一开始就是一个多种族城市。除了英国人和华人之外，还有欧亚混血儿、印度人、来自澳门的葡萄牙人、来自孟买的犹太人、其他欧洲人、亚美尼亚人和美国人。如同大多数殖民地双子城一样，这些族群从一开始就居住在两个主要区域：欧洲人占据了较好的土地，而华人则主要居住在海滩边和山坡上的小棚屋里。鲍林总督在 1858 年 9 月感叹道：“本地居民与欧洲人几乎完全隔绝；种族间的社交往来完全不存在。” ² +

This does not mean that /the Chinese and European communities had no contact with each other.  +
All Europeans in Hong Kong, writes Christopher Munn, had “a range of daily contacts 日常交往 with Chinese inhabitants 居民, and a substantial 大量的；多的；重大的 population of Chinese existed in the colony to serve (v.) European or colonial needs.” +
Rather, #a mixed society# evolved (v.)演变；逐步发展；逐渐形成 `后定说明` #that# *was* _from the beginning_ *determined* (v.) by the political dominance 统治；支配；优势 of the British /and the economic importance of the Chinese.  +

相反，一个混合社会逐渐形成，它从一开始就由英国人的政治主导地位, 和华人的经济重要性所决定。

Colonialism 殖民主义 brought Chinese and Europeans into both collaboration and conflict.  +
*Even more so 比……更加如此 than* in other colonies, given 考虑到 the island’s small size and limited (a.) land for building, `主` space in Hong Kong `系` could be highly contested 争夺；竞争；争辩.  +

考虑到香港面积小、建筑用地有限，与其他殖民地相比，香港的空间竞争可能会非常激烈。

Sources 信息来源；原始资料 do not *reveal 揭示；显示；透露 much about* how the Chinese viewed (v.) the Europeans, but Europeans often complained about _the smells and sounds_ from the Chinese community: _open-air   markets_ and _incense_ (n.)香；焚香, _musical instruments_  and _firecrackers_ 鞭炮；爆竹 from religious ceremonies 宗教仪式, and _the cries_ of hawkers 小商贩；叫卖小贩；饲鹰者 and peddlers 小贩；摊贩.  +

.houses of disreputable women 妓院

在维多利亚时代，受过教育的欧洲人（即文中提到的 "ears polite"）在书面语中非常忌讳直接使用生肉直白的词汇，因此会使用一系列委婉语。

- 基督教规：周日（Sabbath 安息日）应该是安静祈祷、去教堂的日子，不能娱乐和工作。
- 冲突：华人并没有这个习俗，周日照样看戏（theatrical performances）、开店。在欧洲人看来，周日听到隔壁华人妓院或戏院里锣鼓喧天，简直是对上帝的亵渎。

不过, 虽然英国人嘴上批评这些场所“名声狼藉”，但实际上，当时港英政府为了增加税收，是对妓院实行**持牌管理（Licensed brothels）**的，甚至还专门设有“性病检查”制度。

.profane
(v.)[ VN] ( formal ) *to treat* (v.) sth holy *with* a lack of respect 亵渎神灵；亵圣

-> 来自拉丁语profanus,世俗的，不敬神的，##来自pro,在前面，fano,庙宇，神庙，词源同 festival (节日，节庆),theist.字面意思即在庙前面的，##引申词义过庙不拜的人或不允许进庙的人。后用于动词词义亵渎神灵，亵渎等。

This does not mean that the Chinese and European communities had no contact with each other.  +
All Europeans in Hong Kong, writes Christopher Munn, had “a range of daily contacts with Chinese inhabitants, and a substantial population of Chinese existed in the colony to serve European or colonial needs.”3 Rather, a mixed society evolved that was from the beginning determined by the political dominance of the British and the economic importance of the Chinese.  +
Colonialism brought Chinese and Europeans into both collaboration and conflict.  +
Even more so than in other colonies, given the island’s small size and limited land for building, space in Hong Kong could be highly contested.  +
Sources do not reveal much about how the Chinese viewed the Europeans, but Europeans often complained about the smells and sounds from the Chinese community: open-air markets and incense, musical instruments and firecrackers from religious ceremonies, and the cries of hawkers and peddlers.  +
European residents also frequently criticized the government for allowing Chinese residents to run “houses of disreputable women” in or near European neighborhoods and to profane the Christian Sabbath by holding theatrical performances on Sunday.  +
Both European residents and colonial officials often complained that the Chinese built flimsy wood structures that were too close together, increasing the risk of fire and the spread of disease.  +
This contact between Chinese and British led to racism on both sides, but it particularly made many Europeans think of themselves as members of a special community.
这并非意味着华人社群和欧洲人社群之间毫无联系。克里斯托弗·蒙恩写道，所有在港的欧洲人都“与华人居民有着各种各样的日常接触，而且殖民地中也存在着相当数量的华人，为欧洲人或殖民地的需求服务。” ³ 相反，一种混合​​社会逐渐形成，其从一开始就受到英国政治主导地位和华人经济重要性的制约。殖民主义使华人和欧洲人既有合作也有冲突。鉴于香港岛面积狭小，土地资源有限，空间争夺尤为激烈，这种情况比其他殖民地更为突出。史料并未过多揭示华人如何看待欧洲人，但欧洲人经常抱怨华人社群的气味和声音：露天市场和香火的气息、宗教仪式中的乐器和鞭炮声，以及小贩的叫卖声。欧洲居民也经常批评政府允许华人在欧洲人聚居区内或附近经营“妓院”，并在周日举行戏剧表演，亵渎基督教安息日。欧洲居民和殖民官员都抱怨华人建造的木结构房屋过于简陋，而且彼此过于密集，增加了火灾和疾病传播的风险。这种华人与英国人之间的接触导致了双方的种族歧视，尤其使许多欧洲人觉得自己是某个特殊群体的一员。 +
