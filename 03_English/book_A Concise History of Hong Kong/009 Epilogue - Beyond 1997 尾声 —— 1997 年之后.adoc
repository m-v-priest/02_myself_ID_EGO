Epilogue  结语
Beyond 1997  1997 年之后
The burning question surrounding Hong Kong’s reversion to Chinese sovereignty has been how this former British colony will survive under the one country, two systems arrangement.  +
“Time of Certainty Begins: Will Beijing Honor Vows?” asked the front page of the New York Times on July 1, 1997.  +
Two years later, political scientist James Hsiung noted that most predictions about Hong Kong’s future after the handover had been “dismal and downright pessimistic.  +
The worst scenario saw Beijing meddling in Hong Kong’s politics and economic life, and trampling upon its freedoms, including freedom of the press, judicial freedom, academic freedom, and free elections.  +
There would be corruption, nepotism, cronyism, and related plagues, brought in by the Mainland Chinese.”1
香港回归中国后，最引人关注的问题莫过于这片前英国殖民地如何在“一国两制”框架下生存。1997 年 7 月 1 日，《纽约时报》头版刊登了题为“确定性时代开启：北京会信守承诺吗？”的文章。两年后，政治学家熊建明指出，大多数关于香港回归后未来的预测都“令人沮丧，甚至可以说是悲观”。最糟糕的情况是，北京干预香港的政治和经济生活，践踏香港的各项自由，包括新闻自由、司法自由、学术自由和自由选举。腐败、裙带关系、任人唯亲以及其他种种弊病，都将由中国大陆带入香港。 +
As journalist Frank Ching argued in 1999, these doom-and-gloom predictions overlook how People’s Republic of China (PRC) policy toward Hong Kong has always been “dictated by self-interest.” China could have recovered Hong Kong much earlier if it had wanted to—in 1949 when People’s Liberation Army troops stopped at the Hong Kong border, or during the Cultural Revolution when the central government stopped the Red Guards from crossing into Hong Kong—but the PRC government had good reasons for not wanting to bother Hong Kong.  +
The colony served as a window to the outside world and a base for trade with non-Communist countries, provided a supply of smuggled goods during the American and United Nations embargoes in the 1950s, and aided the PRC’s economic development in the 1970s.  +
Still, Ching acknowledged concerns that the PRC government might interfere in Hong Kong to protect its monopoly on power: “China’s promise not to interfere in Hong Kong’s internal affairs is similar to a left-handed person promising only to use his right hand.  +
The promise may very well be sincere but, in the absence of restraints, the left-handed person will sooner or later forget and, without even realizing it, start using his left hand.”2
正如记者弗兰克·程在 1999 年所指出的，这些悲观的预测忽略了中华人民共和国对香港的政策始终“以自身利益为导向”。如果中国愿意，它本可以更早地收回香港——例如 1949 年解放军在香港边境停止进攻时，或者在文化大革命期间中央政府阻止红卫兵进入香港时——但中国政府有充分的理由不愿为香港操心。香港曾是通往外部世界的窗口，也是与非共产主义国家进行贸易的基地；在 20 世纪 50 年代美国和联合国实施禁运期间，香港提供了走私货物的渠道；并在 20 世纪 70 年代助力了中华人民共和国的经济发展。尽管如此，程先生也承认，中国政府可能会干预香港事务以维护其权力垄断地位，这令人担忧：“中国承诺不干涉香港内部事务，就好比一个左撇子承诺只用右手 。 这个承诺或许是真诚的，但如果没有约束，这个左撇子迟早会忘记，甚至在不知不觉中就开始使用左手。” +
The most pressing challenges to the new Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) had little to do with the reversion to Chinese sovereignty.  +
From early 1997 to early 1998, for example, the chicken flu (the H5N1 bird flu virus) killed six people and prompted the HKSAR government to order the slaughter of almost 1.5 million chickens.  +
The Asian financial crisis, caused by currency devaluation in Thailand only one day after the end of British rule in Hong Kong, precipitated a decline in the Hong Kong stock market and property values, unemployment, and a recession from which the HKSAR did not fully recover until 2004.  +
In March 2003, Hong Kong was hit by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), an extremely contagious and potentially deadly form of pneumonia.  +
When the disease was finally controlled in June, some eighteen hundred people had been diagnosed with SARS, almost three hundred of whom died.  +
Hong Kong’s tourist industry suffered, which further harmed the region’s economy.  +
The HKSAR government has also faced the problem of keeping Hong Kong economically competitive in a rapidly globalizing world and in the face of increased competition from mainland China, especially since China’s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001 has diminished Hong Kong’s traditional position as a doorway to China.
新成立的香港特别行政区面临的最紧迫挑战与回归中国主权关系不大。例如，1997 年初至 1998 年初，鸡流感（H5N1 禽流感病毒）导致 6 人死亡，并促使香港特区政府下令扑杀近 150 万只鸡。香港脱离英国统治仅一天后，泰国货币贬值引发亚洲金融危机，导致香港股市和房地产价值下跌，失业率上升，经济陷入衰退，香港特区直到 2004 年才完全恢复。2003 年 3 月，香港遭受严重急性呼吸综合征（SARS）的侵袭，这是一种传染性极强且可能致命的肺炎。疫情最终在 6 月得到控制时，约有 1800 人确诊感染 SARS，其中近 300 人死亡。香港旅游业遭受重创，进一步损害了该地区的经济。香港特区政府还面临着如何在快速全球化的世界中保持香港经济竞争力，以及面对来自中国大陆日益激烈的竞争的问题，尤其是在中国于 2001 年加入世界贸易组织之后，香港作为通往中国门户的传统地位有所削弱。 +
Hong Kong has not only survived the reversion to Chinese sovereignty, but observers also frequently express surprise at how little the region seems to have changed since 1997.  +
Many senior government officials have remained in place.  +
English continues to be the language of success in business and government.  +
Hong Kong’s expatriate community still comprises 2-3 percent of Hong Kong’s population.  +
Most Western expatriates never learn Chinese, still live in better housing and have higher salaries than most local Chinese, and do not plan to stay in Hong Kong for long.  +
British expatriates, some with family ties to Hong Kong dating back to the late 1800s, continue to make more money than they ever could in Britain.  +
Although in 1996 the British government granted the seven thousand South Asians (mostly Indians) in Hong Kong the right of entry and abode in Britain, there is still a sizable Indian community.  +
The Gurkhas, the Nepalese warriors who once fought so proudly for the British Army, no longer serve their colonial masters, but they are now seen throughout Hong Kong as security guards at apartment complexes, office buildings, and shopping malls.  +
(The majority of expatriates, however, have no historical connections to British colonialism: they are the Filipino and Thai women who work as domestic servants for middle- and upper-class Chinese and expatriate families.) Horse racing, protected under the one country, two systems arrangement, enjoys a fanatical popularity almost inexplicable to visitors.  +
The main leisure activities in Hong Kong are still eating and shopping, with restaurants and shopping malls galore.  +
“Despite the change of guards, and of the emblems,” James Hsiung concluded in 1999, “little seemed to have changed for the people in the street.”3
香港不仅在回归中国后依然屹立不倒，而且观察人士常常惊讶于自1997年以来，该地区似乎变化甚微。许多高级政府官员仍然留任。英语仍然是商业和政府领域成功的通用语言。香港的外籍人士仍然占香港人口的2%至3%。大多数西方外籍人士从未学习过中文，他们的住房条件和收入仍然优于大多数本地华人，而且他们并不打算在香港长期居住。一些与香港有着可追溯至19世纪末的家族渊源的英国外籍人士，在香港的收入仍然比他们在英国时要高得多。尽管英国政府在1996年给予了在港的七千名南亚裔人士（主要是印度人）在英国的入境和居留权，但香港仍然保留着相当规模的印度社群。廓尔喀人，这些曾经为英国军队英勇作战的尼泊尔战士，如今已不再为殖民统治者效力，但在香港，他们却以保安的身份出现在公寓、办公楼和购物中心。（然而，大多数外籍人士与英国殖民主义并无历史渊源：她们是为中产阶级和上层阶级的华人及外籍人士家庭提供家政服务的菲律宾和泰国女性。）在“一国两制”的保护下，赛马运动依然享有狂热的盛行，令游客们几乎难以理解。香港的主要休闲活动依然是餐饮和购物，餐厅和购物中心比比皆是。“尽管卫兵和徽章都换了，”詹姆斯·熊在1999年总结道，“但对于街上的人们来说，似乎并没有发生什么变化。”3 +
Even while drawing attention to Hong Kong’s uncertain future, the reversion to Chinese sovereignty put the region in the international spotlight in a way that further enhanced its global reputation as a vibrant, cosmopolitan society.  +
In July 2004, a record number of almost two million tourists came to Hong Kong, more than half of them from the mainland.  +
Western tourists also come to Hong Kong in large numbers, although their purpose for coming has changed.  +
Whereas Europeans and Americans used to travel to Hong Kong to catch a glimpse of Communist China across the border, they also came to see traditional China, preserved in the New Territories and seemingly unchanged by the Communist revolution across the border.  +
Now, Western newspapers and magazines brim with articles about Hong Kong, its efforts to promote its heritage, and the dynamic, hybrid flair reflected in its cinema, cuisine, and architecture.  +
The common view of Hong Kong—held mainly by local expatriates—as a cultural desert is not true.  +
Orchestras visit from all over the world (especially during the annual Hong Kong Arts Festival), and Hong Kong has its own orchestra, philharmonic, and dance companies as well as a plethora of new museums.  +
Organizations such as the Hong Kong Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, founded in 1847 by Governor John Davis, continue to promote interest in Hong Kong’s history and culture.
尽管香港回归中国引发了人们对其未来不确定性的关注，但这一事件也使香港成为国际瞩目的焦点，进一步提升了其作为充满活力、国际化都市的全球声誉。2004年7月，近两百万游客涌入香港，创下历史新高，其中超过一半来自中国大陆。西方游客也大量涌入香港，尽管他们的来访目的已然改变。过去，欧美游客前往香港是为了一窥邻国的共产主义中国，而如今，他们也想一睹新界保留的传统中国风貌，这些风貌似乎并未受到邻国共产主义革命的影响。如今，西方报刊杂志上充斥着关于香港的文章，报道香港为推广其文化遗产所做的努力，以及其电影、美食和建筑中所体现的活力与多元融合的独特魅力。那种认为香港是文化沙漠的观点——主要由本地外籍人士持有——并不属实。来自世界各地的乐团都会到访香港（尤其是在一年一度的香港艺术节期间），香港也拥有自己的交响乐团、交响乐团和舞蹈团，以及众多新建的博物馆。诸如成立于1847年由总督约翰·戴维斯创立的皇家亚洲学会香港分会等机构，持续致力于推广香港的历史和文化。 +
Compared with many other former colonies, Hong Kong’s postcolonial experience has been remarkably successful.  +
Still, many people in Hong Kong have been disappointed by the region’s brief post-1997 history.  +
Prodemocracy activists and legislators frequently criticize Beijing for slowing Hong Kong’s road to democratization.  +
Some scholars fault Chris Patten’s last-minute reforms that, however well intentioned, appointed a bureaucratic elite that was committed to promoting democracy but unable to handle Hong Kong’s transition from colony to HKSAR.  +
Others blame Hong Kong’s colonial legacies for its current problems.  +
All former colonies have suffered from adjustment problems, but Hong Kong’s unique status—decolonization without independence—has made it a particularly difficult place to manage.  +
Unlike Hong Kong’s colonial administrators, who by the 1960s enjoyed considerable autonomy from the British government and until then generally paid little attention to public opinion, the HKSAR’s new rulers have the unenviable challenge of satisfying not only the central government in Beijing but also the powerful business interests and the local population within Hong Kong, which, partly because of the changes in the years leading up to 1997, now expect and demand more of their government.
与其他许多前殖民地相比，香港的后殖民转型之路可谓相当成功。然而，许多香港人对1997年后的短暂历史感到失望。民主派人士和立法会议员经常批评北京拖慢香港的民主化进程。一些学者批评彭定康在最后时刻推行的改革，尽管初衷良好，但却任命了一批致力于推动民主的官僚精英，而这些精英却无力应对香港从殖民地向特别行政区的过渡。另一些人则将香港目前的困境归咎于其殖民历史遗留问题。所有前殖民地都经历过转型期，但香港的特殊地位——非殖民化但未获得独立——使其成为一个管理尤为棘手的地方。与香港的殖民统治者不同，后者在 20 世纪 60 年代享有相当大的自治权，脱离英国政府的控制，并且在此之前通常很少关注民意；香港特区的新统治者面临着一个令人羡慕的挑战，他们不仅要满足北京中央政府的要求，还要满足香港强大的商业利益集团和当地民众的要求。由于 1997 年之前的几年里发生的变化，香港民众现在对政府有更高的期望和要求。 +
DISSATISFACTION WITH THE HKSAR GOVERNMENT
对香港特区政府的不满
In the summer of 2002, the HKSAR celebrated its fifth anniversary.  +
Sponsored by the Leisure and Culture Services Department, the celebrations included the Reunification Cup, a series of soccer matches among teams from Hong Kong, Scotland, South Africa, and Turkey.  +
The fireworks display over Victoria Harbour was said to be even more expensive than the one in 1997, which had been the most expensive in history.  +
At “The Music of the Dragons,” a concert at Hong Kong Coliseum, more than ten thousand young people from Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, and Macau set a Guinness World Record for the largest percussion performance.  +
A rock concert at Queen Elizabeth Stadium featured bands from Hong Kong, mainland China, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia.  +
The visiting military band of the People’s Liberation Army provided a dance, musical, and marching performance.
2002年夏季，香港特别行政区庆祝成立五周年。在康乐及文化事务署的赞助下，庆祝活动包括“统一杯”足球赛，参赛队伍包括来自香港、苏格兰、南非和土耳其的球队。维多利亚港的烟花表演据说比1997年的烟花表演更加昂贵，而1997年的烟花表演曾是历史上最昂贵的。在香港体育馆举行的“龙之乐章”音乐会上，来自香港、中国内地、台湾和澳门的一万多名年轻人创造了吉尼斯世界纪录，成为规模最大的打击乐表演。在伊利沙伯体育馆举行的摇滚音乐会上，来自香港、中国内地、台湾、日本和澳大利亚的乐队轮番登台献艺。中国人民解放军军乐队也带来了精彩的舞蹈、音乐和行进表演。 +
Rather than a celebration, for many Hong Kong people the anniversary of the reversion to Chinese sovereignty has been a yearly occasion to express their dissatisfaction with the HKSAR government.  +
On June 30, 1999, the eve of the second anniversary of the reversion, some two hundred people held a candlelight vigil to commemorate the so-called dark days under the HKSAR.  +
Legislative Council member and union leader Lee Cheuk-yan argued that Hong Kong needed a new chief executive.  +
Members of The Frontier, a prodemocracy party, criticized the “hegemony” of the new administration.  +
On July 1, political groups and the Hong Kong Federation of Students staged a march to government headquarters in Central District.  +
Wearing black armbands that symbolized “the demise of the rule of law” in Hong Kong and bearing pictures of Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung, and Security Secretary Regina Ip, the protesters accused the government of “betraying Hong Kong people” and “ruining the rule of law.” Lau Ka-yee of Democracy 2000, another prodemocracy group, called the one country, two systems concept “a lie.” The protesters ended their march by reading a list of the government’s numerous “sins.” Democratic Party chairman Martin Lee explained in a press conference that “the honeymoon is over and the “two systems’ are being blurred.” Lee accused Elsie Leung of “leading the water of mainland law into the common-law well water” and “assaulting the common-law system and the rule of law.” On July 1, 2001, the fourth anniversary of the handover, thousands of prodemocracy activists in several different demonstrations protested against the erosion of democracy since 1997.  +
One group of protesters carried a mock tomb symbolizing “the death of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law” in Hong Kong.  +
Another group demanded direct elections for the chief executive, chanting “one person, one vote.”
对许多香港市民而言，回归中国周年纪念日并非庆祝之日，而是每年表达对香港特区政府不满的契机。1999年6月30日，即回归两周年纪念日前夕，约两百人举行烛光守夜活动，纪念香港特区统治下的所谓“黑暗时期”。立法会议员兼工会领袖李卓人呼吁香港需要一位新的行政长官。民主派政党“前线”的成员批评新政府的“霸权主义”。7月1日，各政治团体和香港学生联会举行游行，前往位于中环的政府总部。示威者佩戴象征香港“法治崩溃”的黑色臂章，臂章上印有行政长官董建华、律政司司长梁咏琪和保安局局长叶贞的照片，他们指责政府“背叛香港人民”和“破坏法治”。另一个民主派团体“民主2000”的刘家仪称“一国两制”是“谎言”。示威者在游行结束时宣读了一份列举政府诸多“罪行”的清单。民主党主席李柱铭在记者会上解释说，“蜜月期已经结束，‘两制’的界限正在模糊”。李柱铭指责梁咏琪“将内地法律引入普通法井水”，“攻击普通法制度和法治”。2001年7月1日，香港回归四周年之际，数千名民主派人士在多处举行示威活动，抗议自1997年以来香港民主的衰落。 一群抗议者抬着一座模拟坟墓，象征着香港“民主、人权和法治的死亡”。另一群抗议者要求直接选举行政长官，并高喊“一人一票”。“ +
Some expatriate former colonial officials have been frustrated with the direction that Hong Kong has taken since the late 1990s.  +
Patrick Hase, who started working in Hong Kong in 1972 and retired as assistant director for social welfare in 1996, believes that morale in the civil service is “very poor” and that the ideal of cooperation between government and people “is disappearing or has perhaps already gone.” Hase contrasts this with the 1970s and early 1980s, which he considers “by far the best administered period in Hong Kong’s history, one where the actions of Government were closer to the real wishes of the people than at any date before or since.” The government was “in closer contact with the real public opinion then than either before or after.” Morale was high and relations between government and people were “excellent,” while among the government “the ideals of dedication to an efficient, honest, intelligent and hardworking service imbued with a genuine commitment to the people of Hong Kong were real and keenly felt.”4 James Hayes, who retired as regional secretary of the New Territories in 1987, laments a “retreat from innocence” that began in the 1970s as government expanded and become more specialized.  +
Hayes is particularly critical of how the interests of the traditional family and lineage in the New Territories have been increasingly under siege since 1997.  +
Whereas the British policy of governing through a few officials meant that many customary practices were recognized and even protected, the Sino-British Joint Agreement and the Basic Law threaten customary law and the rights and privileges of indigenous residents.5
一些曾任殖民地官员的外籍人士对香港自上世纪 90 年代末以来的发展方向感到失望。帕特里克·哈斯（Patrick Hase）于 1972 年开始在香港工作，并于 1996 年以社会福利助理署长的身份退休。他认为，公务员队伍的士气“非常低落”，政府与民众合作的理想“正在消失，或许已经不复存在”。哈斯将此与上世纪 70 年代和 80 年代初进行了对比，他认为那是“香港历史上治理最为良好的时期，政府的行动比以往任何时期都更贴近民众的真实意愿”。当时的政府“比以往任何时期都更能与真实的民意保持联系”。士气高昂，政府与民众的关系“非常融洽”，而政府内部“致力于打造高效、廉洁、智慧、勤勉的服务体系，并对香港市民怀有真挚的承诺，这种理念真实而深刻地体现在每个人的心中”。 4 詹姆斯·海耶斯于 1987 年卸任新界区司司长一职，他感叹自 20 世纪 70 年代以来，随着政府规模的扩大和职能的日益专业化，新界“背离了纯真”。海耶斯尤其批评自 1997 年以来，新界传统家族和世系的利益日益受到威胁。英国政府实行少数官员治理政策，这意味着许多习俗得到承认甚至保护，而《中英联合协议》和《基本法》却威胁到习惯法以及原住民的权利和特权 。5 +
Criticizing new postcolonial regimes is a common pattern among former colonial servants (many ex-colonials still insist that India was better off under the British), but some of the same prodemocracy leaders who campaigned for political reforms under the British have also compared the HKSAR government unfavorably with the colonial government.  +
In an interview on July 1, 1999, the second anniversary of the handover, Martin Lee argued that whereas “when the British were here it was a society under the rule of law, now it is the rule of man.” Emily Lau of The Frontier noted that many Hong Kong people believed that Governor Patten had done a better job than Tung Chee-hwa.  +
And even if they do not compare it with the colonial government, people from all walks of life have regularly expressed their dissatisfaction with the new government.  +
Surveys in the first few years of the HKSAR showed that many people felt that Tung was more interested in helping big business and ingratiating himself than in providing the medical services, care and housing for the elderly, and better housing for the general population that he had promised.  +
On July 1, 1999, a delegation of senior citizens petitioned Tung to honor the vows he had made during his campaign in 1996 to provide better services for the elderly.  +
An opinion poll conducted to mark the anniversary of the reversion found that even while public perceptions of the PRC government had improved, one-third of respondents felt either “quite negative” or “very negative” about Tung’s government.  +
Less than 20 percent were “quite positive” or “very positive,” while less than 8 percent felt “positive” about the anniversary.
批评后殖民时代的新政权是前殖民统治者的一种常见做法（许多前殖民者仍然坚持认为印度在英国统治下更好），但一些曾在英国统治下为政治改革奔走的民主派领袖也对香港特区政府进行了与殖民政府的比较，认为后者逊色不少。在1999年7月1日，即香港回归两周年之际，李柱铭在接受采访时表示，“英国统治时期，香港是一个法治社会；而现在，这里是人治社会。”《前沿》杂志的刘慧玲指出，许多香港人认为彭定康总督比董建华做得更好。即使不将新政府与殖民政府进行比较，各界人士也经常表达对新政府的不满。香港特别行政区成立初期几年的民调显示，许多人认为董建华更热衷于帮助大企业和讨好民众，而非履行其承诺，为老年人提供医疗服务、照护和住房，以及改善普通民众的住房条件。1999年7月1日，一群老年人向董建华请愿，要求他履行1996年竞选时作出的改善老年人服务的承诺。为纪念香港回归而进行的民意调查发现，尽管公众对中华人民共和国政府的看法有所改善，但仍有三分之一的受访者对董建华政府持“相当负面”或“非常负面”的态度。持“相当正面”或“非常正面”态度的受访者不足20%，而对回归周年纪念持“正面”态度的受访者不足8%。 +
THE ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS CONCEPT AND HONG KONG’S AUTONOMY
一国两制理念与香港自治
Under the one country, two systems arrangement, the PRC government has promised Hong Kong a “high degree of autonomy” for fifty years.  +
Surveys in 1998, a year after the handover, showed that a rising public confidence in the HKSAR’s political future, even with the economic recession, was based on satisfaction with Beijing’s noninterference in HKSAR affairs.  +
Even observers in the United States and Taiwan, the two countries that had predicted the bleakest future for Hong Kong, conceded that Beijing had stayed out of Hong Kong affairs.
在“一国两制”框架下，中国政府承诺给予香港五十年的“高度自治”。1998年，即香港回归一年后的民调显示，尽管经济衰退，公众对香港特区政治前景的信心却在不断增强，这主要源于他们对北京不干预香港事务的满意。就连曾对香港前景最为悲观的美国和台湾的观察人士也承认，北京确实没有干预香港事务。 +
Both PRC and HKSAR leaders understand that mishandling Hong Kong’s reintegration with the mainland could have disastrous local and international results.  +
It could lead to mass emigration from the HKSAR, which would hurt international investment.  +
Hong Kong is vital to the PRC’s economic development and political stability.  +
Having played up the recovery of Hong Kong into an event of huge national importance, Beijing can hardly afford to ruin it.  +
Not only would a failed Hong Kong be an international embarrassment, but it could even hurt the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) itself (although some scholars have suggested that the end of colonial Hong Kong also threatens the CCP’s legitimacy since the party is now no longer a vanguard in the struggle against imperialism and oppression).  +
Botching Hong Kong’s reversion would also harm the PRC’s relations with Britain, the United States, Japan, and other Asian nations.  +
Considering that the one country, two systems model was originally designed for Taiwan, ensuring a smooth reversion is also crucial for reunification with Taiwan: a failed reversion would both hurt economic relations with Taiwan and lead to stronger demands for independence there.
中华人民共和国和香港特区领导人都明白，处理香港回归内地不当，可能造成灾难性的本地和国际后果。这可能导致香港特区出现大规模人口外流，从而损害国际投资。香港对中华人民共和国的经济发展和政治稳定至关重要。北京已将香港回归渲染成一件具有重大国家意义的大事，因此绝不能搞砸。香港回归失败不仅会令国际社会蒙羞，甚至可能损害中国共产党自身（尽管一些学者认为，香港殖民地的终结也威胁到中共的合法性，因为中共如今已不再是反帝反抗压迫斗争的先锋）。香港回归失败还会损害中华人民共和国与英国、美国、日本和其他亚洲国家的关系。考虑到一国两制模式最初是为台湾设计的，确保平稳回归对于与台湾的统一也至关重要：回归失败既会损害与台湾的经济关系，也会导致台湾方面更强烈的独立诉求。 +
Many Hong Kong people, however, believe that the PRC government has intervened far too regularly in the HKSAR’s political affairs.  +
A major concern is Hong Kong’s legal and political autonomy under the one country, two systems arrangement.  +
The Basic Law stipulates that Hong Kong residents of Chinese descent qualify for right of abode (permanent residency) in Hong Kong, provided that at the time of birth at least one parent was a Chinese citizen holding Hong Kong right-of-abode status.  +
In 1997, however, the Provisional Legislative Council passed ordinances restricting the procedures for proving right of abode, which led to court challenges.  +
When the Court of Final Appeal supported the legal challenges in January 1999, the HKSAR government warned that the court’s ruling would extend right-of-abode eligibility to some 1.67 million potential new Chinese immigrants and strain Hong Kong’s resources.  +
(The government claimed that housing and educating the new immigrants would cost more than HK$710 billion, equivalent to around US$91 billion.) The HKSAR government then took its case to the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (NPC), prompting an outcry from the Hong Kong legal establishment.  +
Martin Lee accused the government of “giving away” Hong Kong’s autonomy.  +
On June 30, the eve of the HKSAR’s third anniversary, six hundred lawyers dressed in black held a silent protest against the interpretation.
然而，许多香港市民认为，中国政府过于频繁地干预香港特区的政治事务。其中一个主要担忧是香港在“一国两制”安排下的法律和政治自治权。《基本法》规定，凡出生时父母一方为持有香港居留权的中国公民，即有资格获得香港居留权（永久居留权）。然而，1997年，临时立法会通过条例限制了居留权的认定程序，引发了法律诉讼。1999年1月，终审法院支持了这些法律诉讼，香港特区政府警告称，法院的裁决将使约167万潜在的新中国移民获得居留权资格，并给香港的财政资源带来压力。 （政府声称安置和教育新移民将耗资超过7100亿港元，约合910亿美元。）香港特区政府随后将此案提交全国人大常委会，引发香港法律界的强烈抗议。李柱铭指责政府“出卖”香港的自治权。6月30日，香港特区成立三周年前夕，六百名身着黑衣的律师举行静默抗议，反对这一解释。 +
The NPC Standing Committee, which is empowered to interpret the Basic Law, sided with the HKSAR government.  +
This led to a massive legal challenge on behalf of more than five thousand applicants for right-of-abode status, who argued that the NPC decision deprived them of the benefits of the Court of Final Appeal ruling.  +
Critics accused the HKSAR.  +
government of manipulating figures and exaggerating strains on housing, employment, and public health to create a climate of fear and encourage public sentiment against immigrants.  +
Pro-Beijing newspapers supported the Standing Committee’s decision, however, insisting that the Court of Final Appeal had made a mistake.  +
The chairman of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong, Tsang Yok Sing, argued that the HKSAR government should find the “best possible way” to keep the 1.67 million potential immigrants from coming to Hong Kong.  +
Furthermore, although opinion polls after the Standing Committee’s interpretation showed a drop in confidence in the government, they also showed that more than 80 percent of the respondents—concerned about increasing immigration from the mainland—were critical of the court’s decision, while 65 percent supported government action to keep immigrants out.  +
The overwhelming majority, it seemed, preferred the overall welfare of society to the preservation of the law.  +
Accepting the ultimate authority of the Standing Committee to interpret the Basic Law, in January 2002 the Court of Final Appeal reversed its earlier decision by ruling against some claimants on the right-of-abode issue.
全国人大常委会作为基本法的解释机构，支持了香港特区政府的裁决。这引发了五千多名申请居留权人士的大规模法律挑战，他们认为全国人大常委会的决定剥夺了他们根据终审法院裁决所享有的权益。批评人士指责香港特区政府操纵数据，夸大住房、就业和公共卫生方面的压力，以制造恐慌气氛，煽动公众对移民的敌意。然而，亲北京的报纸支持全国人大常委会的决定，坚称终审法院的裁决有误。亲北京的香港民建联主席曾耀声则认为，香港特区政府应该找到“最佳方案”，阻止167万潜在移民涌入香港。此外，尽管常委解释基本法后进行的民意调查显示民众对政府的信任度有所下降，但调查也显示，超过80%的受访者——他们对来自大陆的移民人数增加感到担忧——批评了法院的裁决，而65%的受访者支持政府采取措施阻止移民入境。绝大多数人似乎更看重社会整体福祉，而非维护法律本身。终审法院承认常委对基本法的最终解释权，于2002年1月推翻了其先前的裁决，驳回了部分关于居留权的诉讼请求。 +
In another case that appeared to test Hong Kong’s legal autonomy, in July 2001 the I-IKSAR government allowed Li Shaomin, a Chinese American professor at Hong Kong’s City University, to return after being detained for five months in China.  +
Although Li insisted that he had only been conducting research, he had been convicted in a secret trial for harming China’s national security and spying for Taiwan and had then been expelled from China.  +
Many observers saw Li’s case as part of a wider politically motivated crackdown on academics with connections to the United States, especially since a Chinese scholar based in the United States had been similarly detained.  +
Li’s father, an advisor to CCP leader Hu Yaobang, had been imprisoned for sympathizing with the students after the Tiananmen Square Massacre in 1989.  +
Although the Hong Kong immigration chief denied having consulted Beijing before making his decision, it was apparent that the HKSAR government had allowed Li to return to Hong Kong because Beijing had let it do so.  +
President George W.  +
Bush and American congressional leaders had urged the Chinese government to release Li, and Secretary of State Colin Powell had just visited Beijing.  +
As Martin Lee put it, “whoever made the decision knew it was important for Hong Kong and that the whole world was watching.” While the case suggested proof of the HKSAR’s legal autonomy, some critics cited it as yet another example of Beijing‘s—and Hong Kong’s—willingness to use legal decisions as political bargaining chips.
在另一起似乎考验香港法律自主权的案件中，2001 年 7 月，香港特区政府允许在香港城市大学任教的美籍华裔教授李少民返回香港。此前，他已被中国大陆拘留五个月。尽管李少民坚称自己只是在进行研究，但他却在一次秘密审判中被控危害中国国家安全和为台湾从事间谍活动，随后被驱逐出境。许多观察人士认为，李少民的案件是针对与美国有联系的学者进行更广泛政治打压的一部分，尤其是在一位旅美中国学者也遭到类似拘留的情况下。李少民的父亲是中共领导人胡耀邦的顾问，曾因在 1989 年天安门事件后声援学生而被监禁。尽管香港入境事务处处长否认在做出决定前咨询过北京，但显然，香港特区政府允许李少民返回香港是因为得到了北京的许可。美国总统乔治·W·布什和美国国会领导人曾敦促中国政府释放李某，国务卿科林·鲍威尔也刚刚访问过北京。正如马丁·李所说，“做出决定的人知道这对香港至关重要，全世界都在关注。”尽管此案似乎证明了香港特区的法律自主权，但一些批评人士认为，这又一次表明北京——以及香港——愿意将法律判决作为政治筹码。 +
Another concern is the future of freedom of expression in Hong Kong.  +
So far, Hong Kong continues to enjoy relatively wide freedom of expression.  +
In March 1999, the Court of Final Appeal overturned the conviction of two men who had been found guilty of desecrating the Chinese national and HKSAR flags.  +
The court argued that their conviction violated the freedom of expression covered by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which under the Basic Law applies to Hong Kong.  +
People in Hong Kong have also been relatively free to criticize the PRC government.  +
When demonstrators protested President Jiang Zemin’s visit on July 1, 1998, the HKSAR police responded simply by playing classical music to drown out the noise.  +
On July 1, 1999, some sixty prodemocracy activists chanting “Down with Li Peng” and “Democracy for China” interrupted Vice President Hu Jintao’s speech at the unveiling ceremony for a monument commemorating Hong Kong’s reunification with China.  +
On each anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre, protesters have held peaceful demonstrations and vigils.  +
On June 4, 2004, tens of thousands of people, among them many mainlanders, attended a rally commemorating the fifteenth anniversary of the massacre.
另一个令人担忧的问题是香港言论自由的未来。迄今为止，香港仍然享有相对广泛的言论自由。1999年3月，终审法院推翻了两名男子亵渎中国国旗和香港特区旗帜的定罪。法院认为，他们的定罪违反了《公民权利和政治权利国际公约》所保障的言论自由，而该公约根据《基本法》适用于香港。香港民众也相对可以自由地批评中华人民共和国政府。1998年7月1日，当示威者抗议江泽民主席访问香港时，香港特区警方只是播放古典音乐来掩盖噪音。1999年7月1日，约60名民主派人士高喊“打倒李鹏”和“民主属于中国”，打断了胡锦涛副主席在香港回归中国纪念碑揭幕仪式上的讲话。每年的天安门事件周年纪念日，抗议者都会举行和平示威和守夜活动。2004年6月4日，数万人参加了纪念天安门事件十五周年的集会，其中许多是大陆居民。 +
Although freedom of the press is guaranteed by the Basic Law, the PRC government has shown since the years leading up to the handover that it has its own view of what this freedom meant.  +
In May 1996, Lu Ping, director of the Chinese State Council’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, told American news network CNN that news articles supporting “two Chinas” or independence for Hong Kong or Taiwan would “absolutely not” be allowed.  +
In October of the same year, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen promised that the Hong Kong media would enjoy complete freedom and could publish “criticism,” but he warned that the media would not be allowed to publish “rumors or lies” or personal attacks on Chinese leaders.  +
These and earlier warnings appear to have created an atmosphere of self-censorship.  +
In January 1994, local television station TVB decided not to broadcast a BBC documentary of Mao Zedong that the PRC government had criticized as being biased.  +
A 1996 survey by Chinese University Hong Kong’s Department of Journalism and Communication found that many journalists were reluctant to criticize the PRC government.  +
In 1997 the Hong Kong Journalists Association predicted that self-censorship, rather than direct government intervention, would be more likely to undermine freedom of expression in Hong Kong.6
尽管《基本法》保障新闻自由，但自香港回归前夕以来，中国政府对新闻自由的理解却截然不同。1996 年 5 月，国务院港澳事务办公室主任鲁平告诉美国有线电视新闻网（CNN），支持“两个中国”或香港、台湾独立的新闻报道“绝对不允许”发表。同年 10 月，国务院副总理兼外交部长钱其琛承诺，香港媒体将享有完全的新闻自由，可以发表“批评性”文章，但他同时警告说，媒体不得发布“谣言或谎言”，也不得对中国领导人进行人身攻击。这些以及此前的警告似乎营造了一种自我审查的氛围。1994 年 1 月，香港无线电视台（TVB）决定不播出 BBC 制作的毛泽东纪录片，中国政府曾批评该纪录片带有偏见。香港中文大学新闻及传播学系 1996 年的一项调查发现，许多记者不愿批评中华人民共和国政府。1997 年，香港记者协会预测，自我审查而非政府直接干预，更有可能损害香港的言论自由。 6 +
Still, freedom of the press remains greater in Hong Kong than in many Asian societies, certainly more so than on the mainland.  +
At the NPC annual session in Beijing in spring 1998, Xu Simin, a Hong Kong member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, criticized government-run broadcaster RTHK for broadcasting programs critical of the Chinese and Hong Kong governments.  +
But Jiang Zemin warned Hong Kong members of the NPC to stay out of Hong Kong government affairs.  +
And even though Tung Chee-hwa said that while freedom of the press was important, the HKSAR government should be presented favorably, Chief Secretary Anson Chan insisted that RTHK should have its editorial freedom and that this was a local affair.  +
Frank Ching concluded in 1999 that “freedom of the press continues to thrive, despite prophesies of gloom and doom from both the Western and local media before 1997, most of which continued to look at China through the lens of 1989 events at Tiananmen Square.”7
尽管如此，香港的新闻自由仍然高于许多亚洲社会，当然也高于中国大陆。1998 年春季在北京举行的全国人大年会上，香港籍政协委员徐思敏批评香港电台播出批评中国和香港政府的节目。但江泽民警告全国人大委员不要干涉香港政府事务。尽管董建华表示，新闻自由固然重要，但香港特区政府的形象也应该得到正面展现，但政务司司长陈方安生坚持认为香港电台应该享有编辑自由，这是香港特区内部事务。1999 年，程峰（Frank Ching）总结道：“尽管在 1997 年之前，西方和本地媒体都曾对香港新闻自由发出悲观预言，其中大多数媒体仍然以 1989 年天安门事件的视角看待中国，但新闻自由依然蓬勃发展。” 7 +
The problem is that no one is sure how long this press freedom will last or how far its boundaries extend.  +
In August 1999, Xu Simin and Wang Rudeng, assistant director of the New China News Agency local branch, criticized RTHK for giving a representative of the Taiwan regime airtime to argue that China and Taiwan were separate states.  +
Two leaders of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong criticized RTHK for violating the one-China policy enshrined in the Basic Law.  +
Vice Premier Qian Qichen later insisted that support for interstate relations between Taiwan and China violated the one-China principle.  +
In October 2000, President Jiang chided Hong Kong journalists for asking questions about his support for Tung’s reelection in 2002.  +
And after Chen Shui-bian of the proindependence Democratic Progressive Party was elected president of Taiwan in spring 2000, Wang Fengchao, deputy director of the Beijing liaison office in Hong Kong, warned the Hong Kong media not to report on proindependence activities in Taiwan.  +
Although PRC authorities have not specified how they will deal with news groups that violate these prohibitions, there has been a distinct trend toward self-censorship in the local media.  +
(Not all media professionals are as concerned about press freedom: the Hong Kong Federation of Journalists was founded in 1996 by journalists working in the left-wing press to counter the influence of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, which has taken a leading role in defending press freedom.)
问题在于，没有人能确定这种新闻自由能持续多久，它的边界又延伸到哪里。1999年8月，徐思敏和新华社香港分社助理社长王如登批评香港电台允许台湾政权代表发表言论，声称中国和台湾是两个不同的国家。香港亲北京的民建联两位领导人批评香港电台违反了《基本法》规定的一个中国原则。时任国务院副总理钱其琛后来坚称，支持台湾与中国建立国家关系违反了一个中国原则。2000年10月，江泽民总统斥责香港记者询问他支持董建华2002年连任一事。2000年春季，民进党候选人陈水扁当选台湾地区领导人后，北京驻港联络办公室副主任王凤超警告香港媒体不要报道台湾的独立活动。尽管中国政府尚未明确规定将如何处理违反这些禁令的新闻机构，但本地媒体已呈现出明显的自我审查趋势。（并非所有媒体从业人员都同样关注新闻自由：香港记者联会成立于1996年，由左翼媒体记者组成，旨在对抗香港记者协会的影响，后者在捍卫新闻自由方面发挥了主导作用。） +
A particularly sensitive issue has been the PRC and HKSAR governments’ concerns about seditious and subversive activities in Hong Kong.  +
Beijing has insisted that Hong Kong must not become a base for subversive activities against China, and in early 2001 Security Secretary Regina Ip declared that her government was keeping a “close eye” on the Falun Gong (Practice of the Wheel of Law).  +
A quasi-religious organization that combines Buddhist meditation with traditional Chinese qigong (breathing and movement exercise) techniques, the Falun Gong has been banned in mainland China since 1999 as an “evil cult.” But the Falun Gong is legal in Hong Kong, where it is registered with the Societies Ordinance and its members often hold peaceful demonstrations against the widespread suppression of the movement on the mainland.  +
Over the course of 2001, Tung Chee-hwa shifted from calling the Falun Gong “more or less” to “without a doubt” an “evil cult.” Executive Council member Nellie Fong encouraged the government to pass an antisedition law to monitor the Falun Gong.  +
In May 2001, the HKSAR government formally announced its intention to draft an anticult law, the presumed target being the Falun Gong.  +
The announcement provoked a controversy in the local media.  +
In late June, Chief Secretary Donald Tsang (who had recently replaced Anson Chan) abruptly withdrew the anticult proposal, insisting that the HKSAR administration would pursue the matter in “the Hong Kong way.”
一个特别敏感的问题是中华人民共和国政府和香港特区政府对香港境内煽动和颠覆活动的担忧。北京方面坚持认为，香港绝不能成为颠覆中国的基地。2001 年初，保安局局长叶贞表示，政府正在“密切关注”法轮功。法轮功是一个结合佛教冥想和中国传统气功 （呼吸和运动锻炼）的准宗教组织，自 1999 年起在中国大陆被认定为“邪教”并予以取缔。但在香港，法轮功是合法的，它已根据《社团条例》注册，其成员经常举行和平示威，抗议大陆对该运动的广泛镇压。2001 年期间，董建华对法轮功的称谓从“或多或少”转变为“毫无疑问”是“邪教”。行政会议成员方丽玲曾敦促政府通过反煽动法来监控法轮功。2001 年 5 月，香港特区政府正式宣布拟起草反邪教法，其目标被认为是法轮功。此举在本地媒体引发争议。6 月下旬，政务司司长曾荫权（此前接替陈方安生）突然撤回了反邪教提案，并坚称香港特区政府将以“香港的方式”处理此事。 +
In March 2002, eight Falun Gong followers were arrested in a March demonstration outside the PRC central government’s local liaison office; the eight were later convicted for assaulting and obstructing police.  +
In September, during his second term, Tung Chee-hwa tried to introduce an antisedition and antisubversion bill, at the insistence of Beijing and as stipulated in Article 23 of the Basic Law, which gives the HKSAR government the right to “prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the Central People’s Government” and to prohibit local political organizations from having any contact with foreign political organizations.  +
As the colonial government had in the late 1980s, the HKSAR government published a public consultation paper listing the main provisions of the proposed legislation.  +
One provision allowed the government to ban any organizations that were illegal on the mainland (such as the Falun Gong).  +
After large public demonstrations both for and against the proposed legislation, in early 2003 the HKSAR government announced that the Legislative Council would vote on the bill in July before the current legislative session ended.
2002年3月，八名法轮功学员在中央政府驻港联络办公室外的示威活动中被捕；这八人后来因袭警和妨碍公务罪被判刑。同年9月，董建华在其第二个任期内，在北京的坚持下，试图根据《基本法》第二十三条的规定，提出一项反煽动和反颠覆法案。该条款赋予香港特区政府“禁止任何叛国、分裂国家、煽动叛乱、颠覆中央人民政府的行为”，并禁止本地政治组织与外国政治组织接触的权力。如同上世纪80年代末的殖民政府一样，香港特区政府发布了一份公众咨询文件，列出了拟议法案的主要条款。其中一项条款允许政府取缔任何在大陆被视为非法的组织（例如法轮功）。在民众就该法案举行了大规模的示威游行（支持和反对的都有）之后，2003年初，香港特区政府宣布立法会将在本届立法会期结束前的7月对该法案进行投票表决。 +
In the meantime, in March 2003 Hong Kong was struck by SARS.  +
Even while facing a barrage of criticism for not recognizing the disease earlier and for downplaying reports that the infection was coming from the mainland, the HKSAR government decided to go ahead with the controversial security bill.  +
With confidence in the government plummeting, the timing for reintroducing the bill could not have been worse.  +
On July 1, the sixth anniversary of Hong Kong’s transition to Chinese sovereignty, more than five hundred thousand people staged the largest public demonstration in the young HKSAR’s history.  +
Even more embarrassing for the government, new premier Wen Jiabao was in town for the anniversary and to witness the signing of a new free trade agreement between China and Hong Kong.
与此同时，2003年3月，香港爆发了非典疫情。尽管香港特区政府因未能及早识别疫情以及淡化病毒源自内地的报道而饱受批评，但仍决定推进备受争议的国安法。随着民众对政府的信任度急剧下降，此时重新提出该法案的时机可谓糟糕透顶。7月1日，香港回归中国六周年纪念日，超过五十万人举行了香港历史上规模最大的公众示威游行。更令政府尴尬的是，新任行政院长温家宝当时正在香港出席周年纪念活动，并见证中港自由贸易协定的签署。 +
Although Tung agreed to withdraw the provision enabling the HKSAR government to ban organizations that were illegal on the mainland, he stuck to his guns on the rest of the security bill.  +
When critics of the bill called for his resignation, Tung agreed to defer the vote.  +
After a meeting in Beijing with Wen Jiabao, new president and CCP general secretary Hu Jintao, and Vice President Zeng Qinghong in Beijing, in August Tung announced that the government would reintroduce a modified version of the security bill for public consultation.  +
However, after pressure from critics of the bill and even from his own supporters, Tung withdrew the bill in early September.  +
The fallout from the security bill controversy also affected the November 2003 District Council elections.  +
Although the mainland and local pro-Beijing media condemned them as unpatriotic, many prodemocracy candidates won election, and candidates supportive of the security bill were defeated.
尽管董建华同意撤回赋予香港特区政府取缔在内地属于非法组织的条款，但他对国安法的其他部分仍坚持己见。当批评人士要求他辞职时，董建华同意推迟投票。8月，董建华在北京会见了温家宝、新任国家主席兼中共中央总书记胡锦涛以及国家副主席曾庆红后，宣布政府将重新提出修改后的国安法，征求公众意见。然而，在来自批评人士甚至其支持者的压力下，董建华于9月初撤回了该法案。国安法争议的余波也影响了2003年11月的区议会选举。尽管内地和香港亲北京媒体谴责他们不爱国，但许多民主派候选人赢得了选举，而支持国安法的候选人则落败。 +
In early May 2005, the Court of Final Appeal overturned criminal convictions against the eight Falun Gong followers accused of assaulting and obstructing police in the 2002 protest.  +
In its summary, the court declared that “the freedom to demonstrate peacefully is a constitutional right” and that freedom of expression is “at the heart of Hong Kong’s system and the courts should give them a generous interpretation.” Still, local human rights advocates worry that Hong Kong’s judicial system is being undercut by the PRC government’s power to interpret the Basic Law in ways that might preempt decisions by Hong Kong courts (as it did, for example, by blocking rapid democratic reforms and limiting eligibility for right of abode).  +
Law Yuk-kai, director of the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor, warned after the May 2005 ruling that Hong Kong’s courts could be “completely sidelined.” And many people worry that the Falung Gong case will cause Beijing to take a tougher stance toward less subversive activities in Hong Kong.
2005年5月初，终审法院推翻了对八名法轮功学员的刑事定罪，他们被控在2002年的抗议活动中袭击和妨碍警察执法。终审法院在判决摘要中指出，“和平示威的自由是一项宪法权利”，言论自由“是香港制度的核心，法院应当对其进行宽泛的解释”。然而，香港本地人权倡导者担心，中国政府对《基本法》的解释权正在削弱香港的司法体系，其解释方式可能会凌驾于香港法院的判决之上（例如，中国政府曾阻挠香港的快速民主改革，并限制公民的居留权）。香港人权观察组织主任罗毓佳在2005年5月终审法院判决后警告说，香港法院可能会“完全被边缘化”。许多人担心，法轮功案会促使北京对香港其他非颠覆性活动采取更强硬的立场。 +
Despite its promise of a “high degree of autonomy,” the Beijing government has already taken several measures to limit the growth of democracy in Hong Kong.  +
In late 2003, President Hu Jintao warned Tung Chee-hwa that the issue of electoral reforms could not move ahead without prior consultation with Beijing.  +
On April 6, 2004, the Standing Committee of the NPC ruled that any local attempts to modify election laws would require approval from Beijing, that the Hong Kong chief executive could not introduce any electoral reforms bills without approval from the Standing Committee, and that the Legislative Council could not introduce electoral reform legislation.  +
After local opposition parties condemned the ruling as a violation of the one country, two systems model, on April 26 the Standing Committee declared that direct elections for chief executive or the Legislative Council violated the Basic Law, thus ruling out the possibility of popular elections for chief executive in 2007 and for expanded elections for the legislature in 2008.
尽管北京政府承诺给予香港“高度自治”，但实际上已采取多项措施限制香港民主的发展。2003年底，胡锦涛主席警告董建华，选举改革必须事先与北京协商才能推进。2004年4月6日，全国人大常委会裁定，任何修改选举法的本地尝试均须经北京批准；香港行政长官未经全国人大常委会批准不得提出任何选举改革法案；立法会也不得提出选举改革法案。香港反对党谴责该裁定违反“一国两制”模式后，4月26日，全国人大常委会宣布，行政长官和立法会议员的直接选举违反《基本法》，从而排除了2007年举行行政长官普选和2008年举行立法会扩大选举的可能性。 +
Most people in Hong Kong appear to have resigned themselves to the fact that the Chinese government has ultimate authority over Hong Kong’s constitutional reform.  +
On July 1, 2004, the seventh anniversary of the transition, hundreds of thousands of people protested the PRC government’s decision to prohibit general elections.  +
A survey in the spring of 2004 found that public dissatisfaction with the Hong Kong government’s handling of relations with the central authorities in Beijing was at its highest level since the 1997 handover.  +
But it is difficult to tell how much the demand for political reform reflects popular opinion in Hong Kong.  +
In the first post-handover elections for the Legislative Council in September 1998, approximately 53 percent of registered voters turned out.  +
In the second elections in September 2000, only around 44 percent of voters turned out; the Democratic Party lost quite a bit of support.  +
An opinion poll in May 2004 showed that the support for universal suffrage in the 2007 and 2008 elections had declined steeply since July 2003.
香港大多数民众似乎已经接受了中国政府对香港宪政改革拥有最终决定权这一事实。2004年7月1日，即香港回归七周年之际，数十万人走上街头，抗议中国政府禁止举行大选的决定。2004年春季的一项调查显示，公众对香港政府处理与北京中央政府关系的不满程度达到了自1997年回归以来的最高水平。然而，很难判断这种对政治改革的需求在多大程度上反映了香港的民意。在1998年9月回归后的首次立法会选举中，约有53%的登记选民参与了投票。而在2000年9月的第二次选举中，投票率仅为44%左右；民主党的支持率大幅下降。 2004 年 5 月的一项民意调查显示，自 2003 年 7 月以来，2007 年和 2008 年选举中对普选的支持率急剧下降。 +
COLONIALISM AND ITS LEGACIES
殖民主义及其遗留问题
How did being a British colony for more than 150 years affect Hong Kong’s history? What are the legacies of colonialism? Despite its rocky start, Hong Kong’s status as a British colony and free port helped make it into a thriving commercial center.  +
The rule of law and political stability encouraged both Chinese and foreign investment, while Hong Kong’s colonial status protected it from many of the troubles that plagued China in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  +
Although the Hong Kong government had more than its share of corruption, its generally efficient and nonpolitical civil service frequently drew praise from the various regimes on the mainland.  +
Under British rule, Hong Kong also achieved a high standard of living for many of its inhabitants.  +
By the early 1990s, Hong Kong’s per capita income had surpassed Britain’s.  +
The region enjoys one of the world’s lowest infant mortality rates and has extremely high life expectancy rates.
长达150多年的英国殖民地生涯对香港的历史产生了怎样的影响？殖民主义留下了哪些遗产？尽管开局坎坷，但香港作为英国殖民地和自由港的地位使其发展成为繁荣的商业中心。法治和政治稳定吸引了中外投资，而香港的殖民地地位也使其免受十九世纪和二十世纪困扰中国的诸多动荡。尽管香港政府也存在腐败问题，但其高效且不涉政治的公务员队伍经常受到大陆各政权的赞扬。在英国统治下，香港许多居民的生活水平也很高。到20世纪90年代初，香港的人均收入已经超过了英国。该地区拥有世界上最低的婴儿死亡率之一，预期寿命也极高。 +
During the countdown to 1997, the Western media depicted Hong Kong as a bastion of democracy, free expression, and prosperity, often ignoring how for so long Hong Kong had been a colony with little democracy or freedom of expression.  +
But any assessment of the British colonial legacy must consider the entire colonial period rather than only the last decade or so of British rule, when the British introduced last-minute political reforms.  +
Although colonial Hong Kong was theoretically based on the rule of law, some jurists and legal scholars argue that common law has never taken root in Hong Kong, mainly because it is so different from the traditional Chinese legal system, while others suggest that most people in colonial Hong Kong had only a superficial knowledge of common law because the language of the law was English (trials are often still held in English, as many judges are expatriates and most counsels received their legal training in English).  +
Furthermore, the government enacted a wave of anti-Chinese legislation from the earliest years, passed various emergency and discriminatory ordinances, and often censored the Chinese press.  +
The 1951 Control of Publications Ordinance, which made it an offense to publish anything that might incite people to commit sedition or treason, was not repealed until 1987.  +
As journalist C.  +
K.  +
Lau argues, Hong Kong’s “supposedly high degree of press freedom” should be “better understood as allowing the press great latitude to comment on Chinese politics, but not on the legitimacy of British rule.”8
在 1997 年大选倒计时期间，西方媒体将香港描绘成民主、言论自由和繁荣的堡垒，却往往忽略了香港长期以来作为殖民地，缺乏民主和言论自由的事实。然而，任何对英国殖民遗产的评估都必须考虑整个殖民时期，而不仅仅是英国统治的最后十年左右——当时英国匆忙推行了一些政治改革。尽管殖民时期的香港在理论上以法治为基础，但一些法学家和法律学者认为，普通法从未在香港扎根，主要是因为它与传统的中国法律体系截然不同；另一些人则认为，殖民时期香港的大多数人对普通法只有肤浅的了解，因为法律语言是英语（审判通常仍然用英语进行，因为许多法官是外籍人士，大多数律师也接受过英语法律培训）。此外，政府从建国之初就颁布了一系列反华法律，通过了各种紧急法令和歧视性条例，并经常审查中文媒体。 1951 年的《出版物管制条例》规定，出版任何可能煽动他人煽动叛乱或叛国的书籍均属违法行为，该条例直到 1987 年才被废除。正如记者刘建国所言，香港“所谓的高度新闻自由”更应被理解为“允许媒体在评论中国政治方面拥有很大的自由度，但不能评论英国统治的合法性”。 8 +
Hong Kong’s colonial civil service was generally efficient and politically neutral, but until the last years Europeans dominated senior positions on the grounds that Chinese were not qualified or trustworthy enough.  +
Political power, writes Leo Goodstadt, “was controlled by colonial officials, alien in both language and culture who, with the other members of this European minority, enjoyed superior status and influence solely on account of their race.” Because they were so isolated from the Chinese community, “expatriates were in no position to identify the frustrations and the aspirations of their constituents, their fears as well as their hopes.” Because these expatriates had little knowledge of life in public housing estates, for example, standards of housing and social services “fell well below what Hong Kong could afford even after its prosperity was assured by its export triumphs.”9 Similarly, James Hsiung argues that because they were not problems facing expatriates, the colonial government had little concern about Hong Kong’s inordinate income-distribution inequities, “the very problem of abject poverty amidst affluence”; the “scandalous” condition of the elderly living in poverty; and the lack of unemployment insurance, which the government believed would only encourage laziness.  +
“The sad thing,” laments Hsiung, “is that this lack of compassion perpetuated by colonial policy as such has rubbed off on the British-educated local elite even into the postcolonial era.”10
香港的殖民地公务员队伍总体上高效且政治中立，但直到最后几年，高级职位仍由欧洲人把持，理由是中国人不够胜任或值得信赖。正如利奥·古德斯塔特所写，政治权力“掌握在殖民官员手中，他们语言和文化都与华人格格不入，与其他欧洲少数族裔成员一样，仅仅因为种族就享有优越的地位和影响力。” 由于他们与华人社区如此隔绝，“这些外籍人士根本无法了解选民的挫折和愿望，他们的恐惧和希望。” 例如，由于这些外籍人士对公共屋邨的生活知之甚少，住房和社会服务的标准“远低于香港在出口繁荣之后所能承受的水平。” 9 同样，詹姆斯·熊认为，由于这些问题并非外籍人士所面临的，殖民政府对香港收入分配极度不公——“富裕之中却存在赤贫”——漠不关心。老年人生活在贫困中的“骇人听闻”的境况；以及政府认为只会助长懒惰而缺乏的失业保险。“令人悲哀的是，”熊感叹道，“这种殖民政策遗留下来的缺乏同情心的风气，甚至在后殖民时代也影响到了受过英国教育的当地精英阶层。” 10 +
Hong Kong has often been described as a capitalist’s paradise and as one of the world’s freest and most competitive economies.  +
But this economy historically depended on political patronage and discriminatory monopolies that favored large British firms.  +
Directors of large British firms such as Jardine and Matheson, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, and the Swire Group regularly held seats on the Executive Council and the Legislative Council.  +
Cable and Wireless, a British corporation, had the telephone monopoly until very recently.  +
Well after World War II, the colonial government refrained from encouraging industrialization because it violated official colonial policy of stressing trade and commerce.  +
The overrepresentation of business and professional classes in the colonial power structure also restricted competition in the property market.  +
As historian Ming Chan puts it, free trade and free enterprise “did not always mean fair trade and equal opportunity.”11
香港常被誉为资本主义的天堂，也是世界上最自由、最具竞争力的经济体之一。然而，历史上，香港经济依赖于政治庇护和歧视性垄断，这些垄断往往偏袒大型英国企业。怡和集团、香港上海汇丰银行和太古集团等大型英国企业的董事经常在行政会议和立法会中占据席位。英国公司电讯公司（Cable and Wireless）直到不久前还垄断着香港的电话业务。二战后，殖民政府一直不鼓励工业化，因为这违背了强调贸易和商业的官方殖民政策。商业和专业人士阶层在殖民权力结构中的过度代表也限制了房地产市场的竞争。正如历史学家陈明所言，自由贸易和自由企业“并不总是意味着公平贸易和机会均等”。 11 +
Free-market economists frequently praise Hong Kong’s laissez-faire system, but this commitment to laissez-faire enabled the colonial government to shirk many of its responsibilities.  +
Compulsory and free primary education was not guaranteed until 1971, and three years of compulsory and free secondary education was not guaranteed until 1978.  +
Nor did the colonial administration have a shining record in higher education.  +
Until the mid-1980s—the last decade of British rule—less than 5 percent of high school graduates could attend degree-granting institutions.  +
(By 1997 the number had risen to 18 percent after the number of degree-granting institutions increased by four times.) And even though by the 1990s more than 40 percent of Hong Kong’s population owned their apartments, at least three hundred thousand people were still living in squatter huts.  +
Although the colonial government frequently justified its low social welfare spending on budgetary grounds, in the postwar period the government faced only a handful of budget deficits.  +
By the end of British rule, writes Goodstadt, “most of the adult population had been reared, educated and spent much of their working lives in an environment disadvantaged and even impoverished by the failure to upgrade the social infrastructure in line with economic growth.” The colonial government was so successful in “making laissez faire and minimal economic and social intervention an integral part of the Hong Kong outlook,” Goodstadt argues, “that not a single serious political party in Hong Kong sought to challenge the legitimacy of this old-fashioned set of doctrines or their primacy in economic management before 1997.”12
自由市场经济学家经常赞扬香港的自由放任体制，但正是这种自由放任的政策使得殖民政府得以逃避诸多责任。义务免费小学教育直到 1971 年才得以保障，三年义务免费中学教育直到 1978 年才得以保障。殖民政府在高等教育方面也并非成绩斐然。直到 20 世纪 80 年代中期——英国统治的最后十年——只有不到 5%的高中毕业生能够进入授予学位的院校深造。（到 1997 年，随着授予学位的院校数量增长四倍，这一比例上升至 18%。）即便到了 20 世纪 90 年代，香港超过 40%的人口拥有自己的公寓，但仍有至少 30 万人居住在棚户区。尽管殖民政府经常以预算为由为其低廉的社会福利支出辩护，但在战后时期，政府仅面临过几次预算赤字。古德斯塔特写道，到英国统治结束时，“大多数成年人口在成长、教育和工作生涯的大部分时间里，都生活在一个因社会基础设施未能与经济增长同步升级而处于不利甚至贫困的环境中。”古德斯塔特认为，殖民政府成功地“将自由放任和最小限度的经济和社会干预融入香港的理念之中”，以至于“在 1997 年之前，香港没有任何一个严肃的政党试图挑战这套老旧教条的合法性或其在经济管理中的主导地位。” 12 +
The British will be remembered for their many contributions to Hong Kong, but they will also be remembered for their many failures.  +
Anna Wu, a lawyer who in 1975 helped found the Hong Kong Observers, a pressure group dedicated to discussing contemporary issues, and who was appointed by Patten to the Legislative Council in 1992, argues that Murray MacLehose’s refusal to introduce elections to the Legislation Council during his tenure was “disastrous” for Hong Kong.  +
Such reforms would have given Hong Kong a “much more stable and more mature alternative” to colonial rule and would have prepared Hong Kong much better for the post-1997 HKSAR government.  +
Politics, Wu maintains, would have “been part of our lives and culture, not a new concept.” By not introducing democracy until the 1990s, the colonial government actually legitimized the PRC government’s opposition to political changes.13 Thus, it is not only Beijing that is to blame for the HKSAR’s problems.  +
Rather, argues Ming Chan, “the inadequate foundation, unhealthy political culture, flawed legal-administrative framework and questionable bureaucratic practices inherited from the British—together with the inability of the Hong Kong people to stand firmly to defend their much cherished freedom, democracy and high degree of autonomy because of their colonial deprivation—ought to be blamed as well.”14
英国人对香港的诸多贡献将被铭记，但他们的诸多失败也同样令人诟病。律师吴安娜（Anna Wu）于 1975 年协助创立了香港观察家（Hong Kong Observations），这是一个致力于讨论当代问题的压力团体。她于 1992 年被彭定康委任为立法会议员。吴安娜认为，麦理浩在其任期内拒绝在立法会引入选举制度，对香港而言是“灾难性的”。她认为，此类改革本可以为香港提供一个“更加稳定和成熟的替代方案”，以取代殖民统治，并使香港更好地适应 1997 年后的香港特区政府。吴安娜坚持认为，政治本应“成为我们生活和文化的一部分，而不是一个新概念 ” 。由于殖民政府直到 20 世纪 90 年代才引入民主，实际上使中华人民共和国政府反对政治变革的立场合法化。因此，香港特区的问题并非仅仅是北京的责任。陈明认为，“香港根基不稳、政治文化不健康、法律行政框架存在缺陷以及官僚作风令人质疑，这些都是从英国继承下来的，再加上香港人民由于殖民时期遭受的剥夺而无力坚定捍卫他们珍视的自由、民主和高度自治，这些也应受到谴责。” 14 +
Colonial officials often blamed Hong Kong’s retarded political culture on its Chinese residents, their traditional culture, and their refugee mentality.  +
Historian David Faure disagrees: “Confucianism no more dictates the evolution of the economy or the evolution of politics in Hong Kong or anywhere else in East Asia than Christianity may be said to be the driving force of such in Europe and America.” Rather, Faure argues, “the failure to widen the franchise in the late 1940s and early ‘50s deprived all of Hong Kong of any effective channel of politicking.” Realizing that there was no room for them in Hong Kong’s administrative structure, Hong Kong people exerted their power in the few arenas where they could, such as business and the professions, thereby creating “the impression that Hong Kong people were apolitical.”15 Similarly, Leo Goodstadt rejects as “blaming the victims” the standard argument that Chinese political apathy was a legitimate reason for not introducing political reforms.  +
“A more accurate explanation of why Hong Kong had no directly-elected members of its legislature until the final decade of British rule was to be found in a colonial culture that combined self-satisfied complacency with mistrust of the local population.” Because the British “lacked the confidence to allow the public to participate directly in the political process,” Goodstadt argues, Hong Kong “remained a constitutional anachronism whose political arrangements remained virtually unchanged from the previous century until the final decade of the colonial era.”16
殖民官员常常将香港政治文化的落后归咎于香港的华人居民、他们的传统文化以及他们的难民心态。历史学家大卫·福尔对此持不同意见：“儒家思想对香港乃至整个东亚地区的经济或政治发展的影响，正如基督教对欧美经济和政治发展的影响一样微乎其微。”福尔认为，“20 世纪 40 年代末 50 年代初未能扩大选举权，使香港失去了任何有效的政治渠道。”由于意识到在香港的行政结构中没有他们的容身之地，香港人只能在少数几个领域，例如商业和专业领域，发挥自己的影响力，从而造成了“香港人不关心政治”的印象。 15 同样，利奥·古德斯塔特也驳斥了那种认为华人政治冷漠是推行政治改革的合理理由的常见论点，认为这是“责怪受害者”。 “要更准确地解释为何香港直到英国统治的最后十年才出现立法会直选议员，应该从殖民文化中寻找答案，这种文化既体现了自满的自满，又体现了对当地民众的不信任。”古德斯塔特认为，由于英国人“缺乏让公众直接参与政治进程的信心”，香港“在宪政上一直处于一种过时的状态，其政治安排从上个世纪到殖民时代的最后十年几乎没有改变。” 16 +
To claim, however, as some observers have, that the interest in politics in the 1980s and 1990s entirely disproves the common image of Hong Kong people as historically being politically apathetic is anachronistic.  +
Demands for reform in the 1980s and 1990s were shaped by Hong Kong’s changing social, economic, and political conditions, in particular the rise of a local identity, the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and the local reactions to the Tiananmen Square Massacre.  +
By this time, Hong Kong was a different place, its citizens a different people.  +
Furthermore, if Hong Kong people deserve much of the credit for Hong Kong’s economic prosperity and political stability, they must also bear some of the blame for its poor housing conditions and social services, repressive education system, and weak political culture.  +
If the Hong Kong public was indeed as resentful of the colonial administration’s poor record in terms of social services and political reform as critics sometimes charge, it could have demanded more from its government.  +
Political and social activists in the 1970s often encountered resentment and resistance from all classes of the Chinese community who, insisting that conditions in Hong Kong were already much better than in China, warned against becoming involved in politics and causing trouble for the government.
然而，一些观察家声称，20世纪80年代和90年代香港民众对政治的关注完全推翻了香港人历来政治冷漠的普遍印象，这种说法是时代错置的。20世纪80年代和90年代的改革呼声受到香港社会、经济和政治环境变化的影响，特别是本土认同的兴起、《中英联合声明》的签署以及香港民众对天安门事件的反应。此时的香港已与以往大不相同，香港人也已发生了变化。此外，如果香港民众对香港的经济繁荣和政治稳定功不可没，那么他们也必须为香港糟糕的住房条件和社会服务、压抑的教育体制以及薄弱的政治文化承担部分责任。如果香港公众真的像批评者有时指责的那样，对殖民政府在社会服务和政治改革方面的糟糕表现感到愤慨，那么他们本可以向政府提出更高的要求。 20 世纪 70 年代的政治和社会活动家经常遭到华人社会各阶层的怨恨和抵制，他们坚持认为香港的情况已经比中国大陆好得多，并警告不要参与政治，以免给政府带来麻烦。 +
The end of British rule did not give Hong Kong a fresh start.  +
On the contrary, Beijing is committed to keeping Hong Kong’s political structure in the form it had assumed by the last years of the colonial era, especially the functional constituency model for the new Legislative Council because legislators from these constituencies consistently vote against any measures to promote democratic reforms, civil liberties, or political accountability.  +
In his July 1, 1997, speech celebrating the establishment of the HKSAR, Tung Chee-hwa explained that the Basic Law “reaffirms the implementation of a different system within one country” and “protects the rights and lifestyle of Hong Kong people and delineates our obligations.”17 But some critics argue that the Basic Law prevents the HKSAR from modifying or expanding its welfare and economic policies to fit the needs of changing times and that it has expanded the role of the business elite, especially from the property sector, in Hong Kong’s power structure.  +
According to Goodstadt, the Basic Law has made it hard for the HKSAR government to break from the old laissez-faire doctrine, guaranteeing that Hong Kong’s economy “should be managed along the most conservative lines.”18
英国统治的结束并未给香港带来新的开始。相反，北京致力于维持香港在殖民时代末期形成的政治结构，尤其是立法会的功能选区制，因为这些选区的议员一贯反对任何旨在促进民主改革、公民自由或政治问责的措施。董建华在 1997 年 7 月 1 日庆祝香港特别行政区成立的讲话中解释说，《基本法》“重申一国之内实行不同制度”，并“保护香港市民的权利和生活方式，明确我们的义务”。 17 但一些批评人士认为，《基本法》阻碍了香港特别行政区根据时代变迁调整或扩展其福利和经济政策，并扩大了商业精英，特别是房地产精英在香港权力结构中的作用。古德斯塔特认为，《基本法》使得香港特区政府难以摆脱旧的自由放任主义原则，从而保证了香港经济“应以最保守的方式进行管理”。 18 +
One considerably less controversial legacy of colonialism in Hong Kong is the English language, which continues to be important in government, business, and the professions and which according to the Basic Law will remain an official language in the HKSAR.  +
Despite controversial and not entirely successful efforts by the government to promote the study of Mandarin (or Putonghua), there is little doubt that English will survive in Hong Kong.  +
Unlike some postcolonial societies, there have been no attempts in Hong Kong to eradicate English for nationalist or political reasons.  +
Far from being condemned as the language of the colonial oppressor, English is widely regarded as crucial for maintaining Hong Kong’s status as a regional headquarters to multinational companies (even while many of these companies have opened offices in mainland China) and as the language of success in the business, financial, and professional communities.  +
When the Hong Kong government decreed shortly before the handover that Chinese would be the language of instruction for most schools after 1998, many schools and parents opposed the decree.  +
And while learning Mandarin is becoming increasingly important for doing business with the mainland, a command of English will always be an important asset for another valuable prize: emigrating to English-speaking countries.
香港殖民主义遗留的诸多影响中，英语的影响力相对较小，争议也相对较少。英语在政府、商业和专业领域仍然扮演着重要角色，并且根据《基本法》，英语将继续作为香港特别行政区的官方语言之一。尽管政府曾努力推广普通话（或称汉语普通话）学习，但效果并不理想，也引发了一些争议。然而，英语在香港的生存发展毋庸置疑。与一些后殖民社会不同，香港从未出于民族主义或政治原因试图根除英语。英语不仅没有被视为殖民压迫者的语言而受到谴责，反而被广泛认为是维持香港作为跨国公司区域总部地位的关键（即便许多跨国公司已在中国大陆设立办事处），也是商业、金融和专业领域成功人士的必备语言。1998年香港回归前不久，香港政府颁布法令，规定大部分学校的教学语言为中文，这一法令遭到了许多学校和家长的反对。虽然学习普通话对于与中国大陆开展业务变得越来越重要，但掌握英语始终是一项重要的资产，因为它可以带来另一项宝贵的收获：移民到英语国家。 +
While the role of English as the language of the colonial administration helped make Hong Kong an international city, the weak command of English in Hong Kong is also a legacy of colonial rule.  +
Some educators and employers have noted a decline in the quality of English since 1997, but longtime observers realize that the level of English in Hong Kong has always been low.  +
It is not only poorly trained teachers employing ineffective and outdated teaching methods who are to blame; the weak command of English is also a result of Hong Kong’s divided colonial social structure.  +
As C.  +
K.  +
Lau argues, “the English-speaking community and the Chinese-speaking community have always lived parallel but largely separate lives.” Thus, there are “virtually no opportunities for most Hong Kong Chinese to use the English they learn at school in real life.” Unlike in Singapore, where the postcolonial government has promoted the use of English both to strengthen Singapore’s status as a shipping and trading center and to achieve racial harmony among that city-state’s multiethnic population, “English is not a language that the average Hong Kong Chinese use spontaneously as a means of communication.”19
英语作为殖民时期的官方语言，虽然助力香港成为国际化都市，但香港人英语水平低下也是殖民统治的遗留问题。一些教育工作者和雇主注意到，自 1997 年以来，香港英语水平有所下降，但长期观察人士认为，香港的英语水平一直不高。这不仅是由于教师培训不足、教学方法陈旧过时造成的，也是香港殖民时期社会结构分裂的结果。正如刘家辉所言，“英语社群和华语社群一直过着平行但又相对独立的生活方式。” 因此，“大多数香港华人几乎没有机会在现实生活中运用他们在学校学到的英语。”与新加坡不同，新加坡后殖民时代的政府大力推广英语，既是为了巩固其作为航运和贸易中心的地位，也是为了促进这个城邦国家多元种族人口之间的种族和谐，“英语并不是香港普通华人自发使用的交流语言。” 19 +
THE LEADERSHIP PROBLEM  领导力问题
One of the most serious weaknesses of Hong Kong’s post-1997 political system is also a legacy from the colonial period.  +
This weakness, in the words of Lau, is the HKSAR’s “failure to produce political leadership.”20 In January 2001, Anson Chan, Hong Kong’s highly popular chief secretary, suddenly announced that she would resign in May, a year before her contract expired.  +
Known for disagreeing with Tung Chee-hwa about the pace of democratic reforms and for defending press freedom in Hong Kong, Chan had earlier declared that she would resign before approving policies that would compromise her principles.  +
In July 2003, two of the most unpopular members of Tung’s cabinet resigned.  +
On July 16, 2003, Security Secretary Regina Ip resigned after the July 1 demonstration against her proposed National Security Bill.  +
Hours later, Financial Secretary Antony Leung, who was already under fire for failing to reduce Hong Kong’s high unemployment rate and to restore consumer confidence in the economy, stepped down.  +
Leung had been criticized for purchasing a luxury Lexus automobile just before delivering the 2003 budget, which included increasing the tax rate on new cars.  +
Although Leung insisted that he had decided to increase the tax, which would have cost him HK$50,000 (US$6,400), only after purchasing his new car, the case embarrassed the HKSAR government and hurt its credibility, especially when the government seemed so unwilling to investigate the case, which became known as “Lexusgate.” In July 2004, two top health officials stepped down after a Legislative Council report on the SARS epidemic of 2003 found that the government had been slow in trying to contain the contamination from SARS.
香港 1997 年后的政治体制最严重的缺陷之一，也是殖民时期遗留下来的。用刘的话来说，这个缺陷就是香港特区“未能产生政治领导人”。 2001 年 1 月，香港政务司司长陈方安生突然宣布将于 5 月辞职，比其任期届满提前一年。陈方安生因在民主改革的步伐上与董建华意见相左，以及捍卫香港新闻自由而闻名。此前，她曾表示，在批准任何有损其原则的政策之前，她都会辞职。2003 年 7 月，董建华内阁中两位最不受欢迎的成员相继辞职。2003 年 7 月 16 日，保安司司长叶贞在 7 月 1 日爆发反对其提出的《国家安全法》的示威游行后辞职。数小时后，财政司司长梁振英也辞职了。此前，梁振英因未能降低香港高失业率和恢复消费者对经济的信心而备受指责。梁振英还因在公布 2003 年财政预算案（其中包括提高新车税率）前购买了一辆豪华雷克萨斯汽车而受到批评。尽管梁振英坚称他是在购买新车后才决定增加税款（这将使他损失 5 万港元，约合 6400 美元），但此事令香港特区政府难堪，损害了其公信力，尤其是在政府似乎不愿调查此案的情况下，该案后来被称为“雷克萨斯门”。2004 年 7 月，立法会一份关于 2003 年非典疫情的报告指出，政府在控制非典疫情蔓延方面行动迟缓，随后两名高级卫生官员辞职。 +
The premature resignation of Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong’s first postcolonial head of government, is only the most celebrated example of this leadership problem.  +
Although Tung insisted that he was stepping down for health reasons, his resignation in March 2005, during the second half of his second five-year term, was widely seen as proof that he had failed to please the PRC government.  +
Tung had lost his main backer in Beijing, former president Jiang Zemin, while new president Hu Jintao, faced with complaints from Hong Kong’s business tycoons about Tung’s performance, felt no obligation to retain him.  +
In December 2004, Hu had publicly criticized Tung after legal challenges prevented the HKSAR government from making a major sale of government-owned land.  +
As Hong Kong-based editor Hugo Restall explains, Tung was also losing “even the small semblance of control he once enjoyed over his cabinet.” Tung resigned just in time for the Selection Committee, whose term was to expire in mid-July 2005, to pick his successor.  +
Had he waited any later to resign, argues Restall, Beijing would have had to form a new selection committee, drawing unwanted attention to the undemocratic nature of the selection process.21
香港首位后殖民时代特首董建华的提前辞职，只是这一领导困境中最引人注目的一个例子。尽管董建华坚称辞职是出于健康原因，但他在 2005 年 3 月，也就是其第二个五年任期的后半段辞职，被普遍视为他未能取悦中国政府的证据。董建华失去了他在北京的主要支持者——前国家主席江泽民，而新任国家主席胡锦涛面对香港商界巨头对其政绩的抱怨，也觉得没有义务留用他。2004 年 12 月，胡锦涛曾公开批评董建华，此前香港特区政府因法律诉讼而无法出售大量国有土地。正如常驻香港的编辑雨果·雷斯托尔（Hugo Restall）所解释的那样，董建华也正在失去“他曾经对内阁拥有的微弱控制力”。董建华及时辞职，赶在遴选委员会选出继任者之前完成了工作，该委员会的任期将于 2005 年 7 月中旬届满。雷斯托尔认为，如果他再晚些辞职，北京就不得不组建一个新的遴选委员会，这将使遴选过程的不民主性质受到不必要的关注 。21 +
If Tung Chee-hwa had a hard time as chief executive of Hong Kong, his successor, former chief secretary Donald Tsang, also has his work cut out for him.  +
Tsang, who in 1995 had been the first Chinese to become financial secretary, had the greatest public approval of any member of Tung’s cabinet.  +
Tsang also enjoys the support of the business magnates who urged Beijing to remove Tung.  +
Like the PRC leaders, these tycoons oppose greater democratic reform in Hong Kong.  +
The PRC leaders fear that democratization in Hong Kong might fuel demands for the same on the mainland, while both PRC leaders and the local business moguls worry that democratization would result in higher taxes and in demands for more government spending.  +
Thus, Tsang will have to perform a very careful balancing act: not alienating his business supporters, proving his loyalty to China after so many years of dedicated service to the British (for which he was knighted in 1997), and satisfying the ordinary people who, writes Restall, “are fed up with government and business elites colluding to determine Hong Kong’s future without popular input.”22 If the experience of the Tung administration is any lesson, it is the people of Hong Kong who will be shortchanged in this delicate balancing act.
如果说董建华担任香港特首期间处境艰难，那么他的继任者、前政务司司长曾荫权也面临着艰巨的挑战。曾荫权于 1995 年成为首位担任财政司司长的中国人，也是董建华内阁成员中民意支持率最高的人。曾荫权还得到了那些曾敦促北京撤换董建华的商界巨头的支持。与中国大陆领导人一样，这些商界巨头也反对香港进行更深入的民主改革。中国大陆领导人担心香港的民主化进程可能会引发内地民众对民主化的呼声，而中国大陆领导人和香港商界巨头都担心民主化会导致税收增加，并促使民众要求政府增加支出。因此，曾荫权必须小心翼翼地权衡各方利益：既要避免疏远他的商业支持者，又要证明自己在多年效忠英国（并因此于 1997 年被授予爵士头衔）之后对中国的忠诚，还要满足普通民众的诉求。正如雷斯托尔所写，普通民众“已经厌倦了政府和商业精英勾结，在没有民众参与的情况下决定香港的未来”。 22 如果董建华政府的经验可以作为借鉴，那么在这场微妙的平衡博弈中，最终受损的将是香港民众。 +
In November 2005, Tsang announced that he had appointed 153 members of the public, including prodemocracy legislators such as Democratic Party leader Lee Wing-tat, to join the Commission on Strategic Development, the HKSAR advisory group that is studying how to expand democratic reforms in Hong Kong.  +
Only three weeks earlier, Tsang had been criticized and ridiculed by prodemocracy lawmakers for comparing Hong Kong’s slow progress toward universal suffrage with the United States, where women did not gain the right to vote until well more than a century after the United States won its independence.  +
Surely, critics such as barrister and legislator Ronny Tong asked, Tsang was not suggesting that it might take Hong Kong another century to achieve universal suffrage.  +
Prodemocracy critics have also rejected any assertions that Hong Kong is not ready for democracy, and Tsang’s insistence that democratization in Hong Kong must be a gradual process that cannot take place without the approval of the authorities in Beijing, noting that other former colonies and Communist countries have had democracy for years.  +
Other critics have complained that Tsang, despite his own humble origins and professed interest in democratization, has continued his predecessor’s habit of appointing mainly older businessmen and bankers to his cabinet.
2005年11月，曾荫权宣布委任153名市民代表，其中包括民主党领袖李永达等民主派立法会议员，加入香港特区战略发展委员会。该委员会是香港特区政府的咨询机构，负责研究如何扩大香港的民主改革。就在三周前，曾荫权因将香港在普选进程中的缓慢进展与美国相提并论而遭到民主派立法会议员的批评和嘲讽。在美国，女性获得选举权的时间比美国独立一个多世纪后才到来。批评人士，例如大律师兼立法会议员唐荣，质疑曾荫权是否暗示香港可能还需要一个世纪才能实现普选。支持民主的批评人士也驳斥了香港尚未做好民主准备的说法，以及曾荫权坚持认为香港民主化必须是一个渐进的过程，必须得到北京当局的批准才能进行的观点。他们指出，其他前殖民地和共产主义国家已经实行民主多年。另一些批评人士则抱怨说，曾荫权虽然出身卑微，也声称对民主化感兴趣，但他仍然延续了前任的做法，任命年长的商人和银行家担任内阁成员。 +
HONG KONG AND MAINLAND CHINA
香港和中国大陆
Eclipsed by the concerns and speculations about Hong Kong’s new status, a less frequently asked question is what Hong Kong’s reversion to Chinese sovereignty has meant for people in China.  +
On the eve of the 1997 reversion, many observers predicted that because the PRC would have to tolerate some autonomy for Hong Kong, this would lead other areas of China to copy what has made Hong Kong so successful.  +
But China itself is changing so quickly that Hong Kong’s reversion is unlikely to have much of an effect on the mainland.  +
Although the official mainland media covered the countdown to the handover with special television shows and documentaries about Hong Kong, it now rarely even comments on the anniversary of Hong Kong’s return.  +
Indeed, having reverted to Chinese sovereignty, Hong Kong has lost much of its distinctive quality, a distinctiveness that becomes less prominent every year as mainland cities become more developed.  +
At the same time, Hong Kong remains a foreign place to many mainlanders.  +
Until the signing of the Closer Economic Partnership Agreement between Hong Kong and Guangdong in 2003 and the “individual tourism” scheme introduced in autumn 2003 for mainland visitors from Guangdong, other neighboring provinces, and various major Chinese cities, obtaining an entry permit to Hong Kong could be harder than to many overseas countries.  +
Flights to Hong Kong usually depart from the international section of mainland airports, and Hong Kong companies still enjoy tax breaks and other benefits reserved for foreign investors.
在对香港新地位的种种担忧和猜测之下，一个较少被提及的问题是：香港回归中国主权对中国大陆人民意味着什么？在1997年回归前夕，许多观察家预测，由于中华人民共和国必须容忍香港享有一定程度的自治权，这将促使中国其他地区效仿香港的成功经验。然而，中国自身也在快速变化，香港回归不太可能对中国大陆产生太大影响。尽管中国大陆官方媒体曾以特别电视节目和纪录片报道回归倒计时，但如今却鲜少提及香港回归周年纪念日。事实上，回归中国主权后，香港已失去了许多独特的特质，随着中国大陆城市的日益发展，这种独特性也逐年减弱。与此同时，对许多大陆居民而言，香港仍然是一个陌生的地方。在2003年香港与广东签署《加强经济合作协定》以及同年秋季针对广东、周边省份及中国内地主要城市游客推出“个人旅游”计划之前，获得香港入境许可可能比前往许多其他国家更为困难。飞往香港的航班通常从内地机场的国际航站楼起飞，而香港企业仍然享有专为外国投资者提供的税收优惠和其他福利。 +
In the past decade, Hong Kong and Guangdong have become more closely integrated than at any time since the 1949 revolution in China, so much so that anthropologist Gregory Guldin has predicted the emergence of a giant “Pearl River megalopolis” that includes Guangzhou, Macau, Hong Kong, and some smaller mainland cities.23 More people than ever before travel across the border between Hong Kong and Guangdong, especially to Shenzhen, while intermarriage—mainly between Hong Kong men and mainland wives—has helped change the texture of Hong Kong society.  +
Although mainlanders in Hong Kong are still sometimes treated as bumpkins who cut in line at bus stops and fast food restaurants and are often blamed for Hong Kong’s rising crime rates, they also comprise the majority of Hong Kong’s tourists and are the new big spenders in the region’s department stores.
在过去的十年里，香港和广东的融合程度比 1949 年中国革命以来的任何时期都更加紧密，以至于人类学家格雷戈里·古尔丁预测，一个巨大的“珠江大都会”将会出现，其中包括广州、澳门、香港和一些较小的内地城市。 23 如今，往返香港和广东的人数比以往任何时候都多，尤其是前往深圳的人数。与此同时，跨地婚姻——主要是香港男性与内地女性的通婚——也改变了香港社会的面貌。尽管在港内地人有时仍被视为在公交车站和快餐店插队、甚至被指责为香港犯罪率上升的罪魁祸首，但他们也构成了香港游客的主体，并且是香港百货商店的新消费主力军。 +
These changes are reflected in how Hong Kong people view mainlanders and themselves.  +
Surveys in the early 1990s found that Hong Kong Chinese considered mainlanders poor, lazy, unfriendly, superstitious, coarse, uncultured, and unintelligent, while mainlanders found Hong Kong people arrogant, hypocritical, and unfriendly.  +
The surveys also found that these negative impressions increased the more often the two groups came into contact with each other.  +
Such feelings appear to have been particularly strong among Hong Kong’s youth.  +
Polls in January and May 1996 showed that only one-fifth of the young people surveyed considered mainlanders to be reliable, and more than three-quarters identified themselves first as Hong Kongese rather than Chinese.  +
With China’s rising profile in the international arena and the emphasis on patriotic education and propaganda, however, Chinese nationalist and patriotic feelings have become pronounced in Hong Kong.
这些变化体现在香港人对内地人和自身的认知上。20世纪90年代初的调查发现，香港人认为内地人贫穷、懒惰、不友好、迷信、粗俗、缺乏教养且愚钝，而内地人则认为香港人傲慢、虚伪且不友好。调查还发现，两地人接触越多，这种负面印象就越强烈。这种情绪在香港青年中似乎尤为强烈。1996年1月和5月的民意调查显示，只有五分之一的受访青年认为内地人可靠，超过四分之三的人首先认同自己是香港人而非中国人。然而，随着中国在国际舞台上地位的提升以及爱国主义教育和宣传的加强，中国民族主义和爱国主义情绪在香港也日益凸显。 +
Even as more and more Hong Kong people are beginning to identify themselves primarily as Chinese rather than as Hong Kong Chinese or Hong Kongers, they often see themselves, and Hong Kong, as being culturally and politically distinct.  +
Unlike people in mainland China (or in the United States), most Hong Kong people have not grown up with various forms of political indoctrination, such as singing national anthems or pledging allegiance to flags.  +
Thus, they sometimes have a hard time identifying politically with China, especially with its Communist regime.  +
The right-of-abode controversy was ostensibly about the autonomy of the Hong Kong judicial system under a new government, but it was also about who qualified as Hong Kong Chinese: many local residents insisted that the mainlanders had no right to settle in Hong Kong.  +
In May 2005, the HKSAR government announced that it intended to raise public hospital charges to deter mainland women from trying to obtain residency for their children by giving birth there.  +
Mainland women, the government explained, accounted for more than 30 percent of births in public hospitals, and the government was determined not to subsidize medical services for nonresidents at the expense of local residents.
尽管越来越多的香港人开始主要认同自己是中国人，而非香港华人或香港人，但他们往往认为自己和香港在文化和政治上都独树一帜。与中国大陆（或美国）的人们不同，大多数香港人并没有从小接受各种形式的政治灌输，例如唱国歌或向国旗宣誓效忠。因此，他们有时很难在政治上认同中国，尤其是其共产党政权。居留权之争表面上是关于新政府领导下香港司法系统的自治权，但实际上也关乎谁有资格被称为香港华人：许多本地居民坚持认为大陆人无权在香港定居。2005年5月，香港特区政府宣布计划提高公立医院的收费，以阻止大陆妇女通过在香港生育来为子女获取居留权。政府解释说，内地妇女占公立医院分娩总数的30%以上，政府决心不以牺牲本地居民的利益为代价来补贴非居民的医疗服务。 +
HISTORY IN HONG KONG  香港历史
Hong Kong’s history did not, of course, end with the colonial period any more than it began with the colonial period.  +
History has in fact become a crucial and ongoing theme in how the new government has tried to smooth Hong Kong’s reunification with China.  +
But this has opened up a host of complicated questions.  +
How, for example, can reunification with mainland China be reconciled with Hong Kong’s status as a place whose history was shaped for more than 150 years by not being politically part of China? How are some of the more turbulent events in PRC history to be treated, especially when they have been viewed with such abhorrence by so many people in Hong Kong, not to mention having caused so many people in the PRC to seek refuge in Hong Kong? The answer has been a curious blend of promoting Chinese nationalism by revising, glossing over, or downplaying much of PRC history while emphasizing Hong Kong’s historical distinctiveness.
当然，香港的历史并非止于殖民时期，正如它并非始于殖民时期一样。事实上，历史已成为新政府努力推动香港回归中国进程中一个至关重要且持续存在的主题。但这同时也引发了一系列复杂的问题。例如，如何才能将与中国大陆的统一与香港的特殊地位相协调？香港在过去150多年里，其历史的形成并非源于政治上属于中国的一部分。又该如何处理中华人民共和国历史上一些较为动荡的事件，尤其是当这些事件令众多香港民众深恶痛绝，甚至导致众多中国内地民众涌入香港寻求庇护时？最终的答案是一种奇特的混合策略：一方面通过修正、粉饰或淡化大量中华人民共和国历史来宣扬中国民族主义，另一方面又强调香港独特的历史地位。 +
When school began in September 1997, the Chinese history textbooks in Hong Kong were noticeably thinner than in previous years.  +
In late 1995, Beijing had called for general changes in Hong Kong textbooks, but in early 1997 Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen declared that history textbooks should be rewritten “to suit the changes after 1997.” Responding to appeals from Beijing, local publishers deleted or reduced topics that might be offensive or controversial: for example, Taiwan and Tibet history, the famine caused by the Great Leap Forward, and the democracy movements in China during the late 1970s and in 1989.  +
The Tiananmen Square Massacre was rephrased as merely an “incident” rather than a “crackdown.” The new textbooks devoted considerably more space to the Opium Wars, which in pre-1997 textbooks had often been described as little more than a trade conflict, and to the Cultural Revolution, which had affected several of China’s leaders.
1997年9月开学时，香港的中国历史教科书明显比往年薄了很多。1995年底，北京曾要求对香港教科书进行全面改革，但到了1997年初，时任副总理兼外交部长钱其琛宣布，历史教科书应该“根据1997年后的变化”进行重写。为了响应北京的呼吁，本地出版社删除或缩减了一些可能引起冒犯或争议的内容，例如台湾和西藏的历史、大跃进造成的饥荒，以及20世纪70年代末和1989年中国的民主运动。天安门事件也被改写为“事件”，而非“镇压”。新版教科书用了更多篇幅来描述鸦片战争（在1997年之前的教科书中，鸦片战争通常被描述为一场贸易冲突）和文化大革命（这场革命影响了多位中国领导人）。 +
The HKSAR government has tried to put aside turbulent parts of Hong Kong’s history that are linked to the PRC.  +
Shortly after the reversion to Chinese sovereignty, Tung Chee-hwa invited several elderly leftists involved in the 1967 riots to a tea reception at Government House, where he commended them for their “outstanding contributions to Hong Kong society.” Some of the men had worked for pro-Beijing newspapers in Hong Kong; others had been members of the famous East River Column during World War II.  +
In July 1999, the government awarded Lee Chark-tim, who in 1967 had been president of the pro-Beijing Federation of Trade Unions and a member of the Anti-British Struggle Committee, the I-IICSAR’s top honor: the Grand Bauhinia Medal.  +
One of Lee’s comrades, Wong Kin-lap, received the Golden Bauhinia Star.  +
In July 2000, Liu Yat-yuen, who had also been a member of the Anti-British Struggle Committee, was awarded the Silver Bauhinia Star.  +
In July 2001, the Hong Kong Security Bureau rescinded deportation orders against several people who had been deported in the 1950s and 1960s as radical leftists.  +
Lo Tong, then principal at a pro-Beijing, patriotic middle school, had been deported in 1950 for raising the PRC flag and singing the national anthem at his school.  +
Tsang Chiu-for, the highest-ranking Chinese police officer in Hong Kong at the time, had been deported in 1961 on suspicion of being a Communist spy.  +
The government also awarded the Grand Bauhinia Medal to Yeung Kwong who, as chairman of the pro-Beijing Federation of Trade Unions and nominal head of the Anti-British Struggle Committee, had led a group of protesters in chanting anti-British slogans outside Government House.  +
The awards were widely criticized by the public and the press as an attempt to vindicate the riots as a legitimate anti-British movement and appease pro-Beijing forces in Hong Kong.  +
Pro-Beijing newspapers and legislators defended the awards, however, arguing that the radical leftists’ role in the 1967 disturbances should not overshadow their subsequent contributions to Hong Kong.
香港特区政府一直试图淡化香港历史上与中华人民共和国相关的动荡时期。香港回归中国后不久，董建华邀请几位参与1967年骚乱的左翼人士到政府大厦喝茶，赞扬他们“对香港社会的杰出贡献”。这些人中，有些曾在香港亲北京的报社工作；有些则是二战期间著名的东江纵队成员。1999年7月，政府授予李泽添（1967年时任亲北京的香港总工会会长及抗英斗争委员会成员）香港特区政府最高荣誉——大紫荆勋章。李泽添的同志黄建立则获颁金紫荆星章。 2000年7月，曾是抗英斗争委员会成员的刘逸源被授予银紫荆星章。2001年7月，香港保安局撤销了对几位在20世纪50年代和60年代因被认定为激进左翼人士而被驱逐出境的人士的驱逐令。罗东，时任一所亲北京爱国中学的校长，因在学校升起中华人民共和国国旗并唱国歌，于1950年被驱逐出境。曾朝福，时任香港最高级别华人警官，因被怀疑是共产党间谍，于1961年被驱逐出境。政府还向杨光颁发了紫荆花勋章，杨光作为亲北京的工会联合会主席和名义上的反英斗争委员会主席，曾带领一群抗议者在总理府外高喊反英口号。 这些奖项受到了公众和媒体的广泛批评，认为这是试图将骚乱合理化为一场合法的反英运动，并安抚香港亲北京势力。 然而，亲北京的报纸和立法委员为这些奖项辩护。认为激进左派在 1967 年骚乱中的作用不应掩盖他们后来对香港的贡献。 +
For the historian, perhaps the most interesting way in which history figures in the ongoing process of Hong Kong’s reunification with China is the HKSAR government’s effort to use history and heritage preservation to promote a sense of Hong Kong localness and belonging within a larger sense of Chinese nationalism.  +
Since 1997, several new museums have been devoted to Hong Kong’s history, all run by the government’s Leisure and Cultural Services Department.  +
The main exhibit at one of these new museums, “The Hong Kong Story” at the Hong Kong Museum of History, introduces Hong Kong’s natural and cultural heritage since prehistoric times with dioramas, reconstructed street scenes, films, and interactive exhibits.  +
Here visitors can learn about Hong Kong’s rich history through a variety of exhibits: boarding a fishing boat that rocks gently to the sounds of straining ropes, strolling through a traditional Cantonese village, or witnessing the horror and suffering during the Japanese occupation.  +
Visitors can also help commemorate the reversion to Chinese sovereignty in an exhibit that includes an excerpt from Jiang Zemin’s handover speech and ends with the handover fireworks display, with Hong Kong’s trademark night skyline in the background.  +
As the last caption in this “Hong Kong Story” notes, even though the museum exhibit ends with the reversion to Chinese sovereignty, “the Hong Kong story will continue to be written.”
对历史学家而言，香港回归中国的进程中，历史最引人入胜的体现或许在于香港特区政府如何利用历史和文化遗产保护，在更广泛的中国民族主义框架下，强化香港的本土认同感和归属感。自1997年以来，香港新建了数座博物馆，均由政府康乐及文化事务署运营，致力于展现香港的历史。其中一座新博物馆——香港历史博物馆的“香港故事”展览，以立体模型、街景复原、影片和互动展品等形式，介绍了香港自史前时代以来的自然和文化遗产。参观者可以通过各种展览了解香港丰富的历史：登上渔船，聆听绳索拉扯的声音；漫步于传统的粤式村落；或亲历日据时期香港人民遭受的苦难与恐怖。参观者还可以通过展览共同纪念香港回归中国，展览包括江泽民回归中国讲话的节选，并以回归烟火表演作为结尾，香港标志性的夜景在背景中熠熠生辉。正如这篇“香港故事”的最后一段文字所言，尽管博物馆的展览以香港回归中国结束，“香港的故事还将继续书写”。 +
