Lesson17


Two of the American hostages being held in Lebanon appeared in a videotape released today, appealing to the Reagan Administration to work as hard for their release as it did to get Nicholas Daniloff out of the Soviet Union.  +
Hostage David Jacobsen: "Don't we also deserve the recognition, the respect and the honorable treatment by the United States government? Don't we deserve the same attention and protection that you gave Daniloff?" Jacobsen, who works for the American University Hospital in Beirut, has been held for sixteen months.  +
Also appearing on the videotape was the Associated Press correspondent Terry Anderson, the first time he's been seen since his capture eighteen months ago.  +
Anderson and Jacobsen had said they were also speaking on behalf of hostage Thomas Sutherland.  +
And they spoke of the death of William Buckley whom Islamic Jihad has claimed to have killed.  +
Sutherland blamed President Reagan for Buckley's murder.  +
"President Reagan made his first mistake in the hostage crisis and Buckley died.  +
Mr.  +
President, are you going to make another mistake at the cost of our lives?" President Reagan today defended his efforts to gain the hostages' release.  +
Speaking to reporters as he left for Camp David, Mr.  +
Reagan said there has never been a day that the administration has not been trying every channel.  +
But he said there was no comparison between the case of Nicholas Daniloff and the hostages in Lebanon "because he was held by a government and we don't know who's holding the hostages." Daniloff himself commented on the hostages' appeal, saying his heart goes out to them and they will not be forgotten.
The White House today gave its view of the upcoming meeting between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Iceland.  +
And officials made it clear that the US intends to pursue a much broader agenda than the Soviets are proposing.  +
NPR's Jim Angle reports.  +
"White House spokesman Larry Speakes emphasized today the US does not see the Iceland meeting as a discussion primarily about arms control.  +
'That issue is important to both nations and the world, ' he said, 'and the US will be diligent in its efforts to seek common ground that could be the basis for progress in arms talks.' Speakes emphasized, however, that the US agenda will be broader than that, even though Soviet statements about the meeting have focused largely on arms control.  +
Speakes says the US will raise all the issues as it usually does, including regional conflicts and tensions in Afghanistan, Africa, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.  +
Speakes said that the US will also raise its concern over human rights issues.  +
Speakes' statement on the Iceland meeting today sought to keep expectation to its minimum.  +
The President's goal, he said, is that both sides gain a better understanding of each other's position at this time and move forward toward a summit in the United States.  +
But Speakes said that the US will be satisfied with the meeting if we accomplish better understanding.  +
If no date is set for a summit in the US, he said, that could be done later.  +
I'm Jim Angle at the White House." From Beirut today, the tired voices of two American hostages, a crudely made videotape of journalist Terry Anderson and American University employee David Jacobsen was released this morning by their captor, the Islamic Jihad.  +
The two men read from texts that seemed to have been written by the captors.  +
They sounded bitter as they assailed what they called the Reagan Administration's refusal to act to secure their release.  +
And Anderson confirmed the death of his fellow hostage, American diplomat, William Buckley.  +
Islamic Jihad claims it murdered Buckley in October of last year, but no conclusive proof of his death has ever been found.  +
From Beirut, the BBC's Jim Muir reports.  +
"This was the first time since he was kidnapped by gunmen in March last year that Terry Anderson, the Beirut Bureau Chief of the Associated Press, has been seen on video.  +
He looked fit but thinner and paler than when he was abducted.  +
He bitterly accused the Reagan Administration of ignoring the plight of the American hosetages in Beirut while surrendering to the Russians over the Daniloff case." "'How can any official justify the interest, and attention and action given that case and the inattention given ours? Do the American people know why we are in captivity? Why the marines and others were killed in bombings at Beirut Airport and the Embassy building? Why they can't roam freely about the Middle East but are always in danger? All this is the result of Reagan's policy, a policy against the people of the Middle East.  +
Our captivity is one part of the result of this policy.  +
William Buckley's murder and the killings of many, many others are another part.  +
Your lack of freedom to travel is another result of that policy.  +
We are not surprised that Mr.
Reagan is not paying attention to our case.  +
More than four hundred Americans have been killed in Beirut without causing him to feel any responsibility or to change that policy.  +
We are surprised that the American government has put pressure on some of the European governments not to negotiate in such cases as ours and has surrendered itself in the Daniloff case, releasing a Russian spy, Zakharov, who was working against our people.  +
We are more surprised that the American people still listen to what Reagan says.  +
How long must we stay in captivity? How long will the American government not pay attention?' The same message was put across strongly by one of Mr.  +
Anderson's fellow captives, Mr.  +
David Jacobsen, Director of the American University Hospital in Beirut, who was kidnapped in May last year.  +
He said that the conditions of the hostages were very bad and had worsened over the past two months.  +
But he said the worst pain came from being ignored by his government.  +
The Islamic Jihad is demanding the release of a group of Moslem extremists jailed for bomb attacks in Kuwait.  +
But both Washington and Kuwait itself have refused to negotiate over their release." From Beirut, the BBC's Jim Muir.  +
Embo has been a controversial leader charged with mismanaging UNESCO while taking the agency in an anti-Western direction.  +
The Reagan Administration cited those reasons when pulling the US out of UNESCO in 1984.  +
Last year, the same charges were behind Britain and Singapore's decision to withdraw.  +
Those three defections forced UNESCO to cut its budget by thirty percent and intensified the crisis around Embo's leadership.  +
Jean Gerard, now US Ambassador to Luxembourg, is the former US delegate to UNESCO.  +
Gerard recommended the US withdraw, because she felt UNESCO's programs were moving away from international cooperation toward confrontation.  +
"Take, for example, the New World Information Order, where in their documents they say that the press should be an instrument of the state.  +
Now this, of course, is totally contrary to our concept of a free press.  +
There are more and more programs which emphasize statist type of solutions to problems.  +
In education, for example, in the teacher-training program in Afghanistan, it's run solely by Soviet teachers with a Soviet coordinator.  +
So, in essence, we were paying for the indoctrination of the Afghan people, which again is not my idea of what an international organization ought to be doing." "To what extent do you think Embo is responsible for the directions that you disproved of in UNESCO?" "I think some of them, of course, were already there, but I think they have been very much accentuated under his tenure.  +
And instead of taking the opportunity to reform the organization, to make it work more efficiently and in a more unbiased way, when we gave our notice of withdrawal, there was a great clamor that there was no crisis and initially very little need for reform aside from some cosmetic reform, and a general resentment of the idea." "Can you describe Embo as a leader, what his personality was like, what his
characteristics were as a leader?" "I would say he's certainly very dynamic.  +
He has a great deal of charm, he has a very personal type of management style, and, I think, he tended to take criticism personally.  +
When we had discussions with him about the budget, the Assistant Secretary of State and myself in 1983, since we pointed out that his figures were very different from the figures that we had under discussion, he then said that the United States, in essence, was behaving in a racist manner, that we had deep psychological problems." "Do you think his resignation is a sign that UNESCO wants the United States and England back?" "It's not, as I understand it, a resignation.  +
It was a statement saying that he would not seek a third term.  +
That does not preclude, of course, some countries from urging him to be the candidate, and the Executive Board nominates the candidate to the general conference." "Do you know if there was any direct pressure on Embo to not seek a third term?" "I know quite a few countries in their governments have been saying that they do not favor his having a third term.  +
That includes the Nordics, who went and informed him of that a few months ago.  +
That includes Japan.  +
And so if you call that pressure, there certainly were several countries that indicated that they were not in favor of his having a third term." "Does Embo's decision to not seek a third term represent a success for the US's decision to pull out of UNESCO?" "I wouldn't say it in those words frankly.  +
I think it's a pity he didn't take the opportunity to be the champion of reform.  +
On the other hand, that's his decision." "What would it take for you to recommend to the United States that this country rejoin UNESCO?" "I think to have a good Director General, to see a serious constructive reform take place both in the management and in the programs.  +
I think that's the kind of thing that would influence many people to take another look at it." From Luxembourg, Ambassador Jean Gerard, former US delegate to UNESCO



今天发布的一盘录像带中出现了两名在黎巴嫩被扣押的美国人质，呼吁里根政府像努力让尼古拉斯·达尼洛夫离开苏联一样努力释放他们。人质大卫·雅各布森：“我们难道不应该得到美国政府的认可、尊重和光荣待遇吗？难道我们不应该得到你们给予丹尼洛夫的同样的关注和保护吗？”在贝鲁特美国大学医院工作的雅各布森已被关押了十六个月。出现在录像带上的还有美联社记者特里·安德森（Terry Anderson），这是自十八个月前被捕以来第一次见到他。安德森和雅各布森曾表示，他们也代表人质托马斯·萨瑟兰发言。他们还谈到了伊斯兰圣战组织声称杀害的威廉·巴克利的死。萨瑟兰指责里根总统谋杀了巴克利。 “里根总统在人质危机中犯了他的第一个错误，巴克利死了。总统先生，你会以我们的生命为代价再犯另一个错误吗？”里根总统今天为他为人质获释所做的努力进行了辩护。里根在前往戴维营时对记者表示，政府没有一天没有尝试过每一个渠道。但他表示，尼古拉斯·达尼洛夫的案件与黎巴嫩的人质事件没有可比性，“因为他是被政府扣押的，而我们不知道是谁扣押了人质。”达尼洛夫本人对人质的呼吁发表了评论，称他的心与他们同在，他们不会被忘记。白宫今天对里根总统和苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫即将在冰岛举行的会议发表了看法。 官员们明确表示，美国打算推行比苏联提议的更广泛的议程。 NPR 的吉姆·安格尔报道。白宫发言人拉里·斯皮克斯今天强调，美国并不认为冰岛会议主要是关于军备控制的讨论。“这个问题对两国和世界都很重要，”他说，“美国将勤奋努力”寻求共同点，这可能成为军备谈判取得进展的基础。”然而，斯皮克斯强调，美国的议程将比这更广泛，尽管苏联关于这次会议的声明主要集中在军备控制上。斯皮克斯表示，美国将像往常一样提出所有问题，包括地区冲突和阿富汗紧张局势、非洲、加勒比、中东和东南亚。斯皮克斯表示，美国也会提出对人权问题的关注。今天斯皮克斯在冰岛会议上的声明试图将期望降到最低。总统的目标，他斯皮克斯表示，双方此时应该更好地了解彼此的立场，并朝着在美国举行峰会的方向迈进。但斯皮克斯表示，如果我们能够更好地了解，美国将对这次会面感到满意。如果没有具体日期他说，峰会定于在美国举行，这可以稍后举行。我是白宫的吉姆·安格。今天从贝鲁特传来两名美国人质疲惫的声音，绑架者伊斯兰圣战组织今天早上发布了记者特里·安德森和美利坚大学雇员大卫·雅各布森的粗制滥造的录像带。两人朗读的文字似乎是绑架者写的。他们指责里根政府拒绝采取行动确保他们获释，语气中充满了痛苦。 安德森证实了他的人质同伴、美国外交官威廉·巴克利的死亡。伊斯兰圣战组织声称去年 10 月谋杀了巴克利，但尚未找到确凿的死亡证据。 BBC 的吉姆·缪尔在贝鲁特报道。 “自去年3月被枪手绑架以来，这是美联社贝鲁特分社社长特里·安德森首次出现在视频中。他看起来很健康，但比被绑架时更瘦、更苍白。他痛苦地说道。指责里根政府无视美国在贝鲁特的困境，同时就丹尼洛夫案向俄罗斯投降。” “‘鉴于该案件以及我们的疏忽，任何官员如何能够证明这种兴趣、关注和行动是合理的？美国人民知道我们为什么被囚禁吗？为什么海军陆战队员和其他人在贝鲁特机场和大使馆大楼的爆炸中丧生“为什么他们不能在中东自由漫游，却总是处于危险之中？这一切都是里根政策的结果，这是一项针对中东人民的政策。我们的被囚禁就是这一政策结果的一部分。威廉巴克利被谋杀以及许多其他人被杀是另一部分。你们缺乏旅行自由是该政策的另一个结果。里根先生不关注我们的案件，我们并不感到惊讶。四百多名美国人已被杀害。在贝鲁特被杀，却没有让他感到任何责任或改变政策。我们感到惊讶的是，美国政府向一些欧洲政府施加压力，要求他们不要在我们这样的案件中进行谈判，并在达尼洛夫案中投降，释放了俄罗斯间谍扎哈罗夫，他正在反对我们的人民。 更令我们惊讶的是，美国民众仍然听里根的话。我们必须被囚禁多久？美国政府还要不关注多久？安德森的一名战友、贝鲁特美国大学医院院长戴维·雅各布森 (David Jacobsen) 也强烈传达了同样的信息，他于去年 5 月被绑架。他说，人质的状况非常糟糕，并且在过去两个月里情况进一步恶化。但他表示，最严重的痛苦来自于被政府忽视。伊斯兰圣战组织要求释放因科威特炸弹袭击而被监禁的一群穆斯林极端分子。但华盛顿和科威特本身都拒绝就释放他们进行谈判。” 来自贝鲁特的 BBC 记者吉姆·缪尔 (Jim Muir) 表示。恩博一直是一位备受争议的领导人，被指控对联合国教科文组织管理不善，同时将该机构引向反西方的方向。里根政府引用了这些原因1984 年美国退出联合国教科文组织时。去年，英国和新加坡决定退出时也受到同样的指控。这三人的叛逃迫使联合国教科文组织削减了 30% 的预算，并加剧了围绕恩博领导层的危机。让·杰拉德 (Jean Gerard)，现为美国驻卢森堡大使是前美国驻联合国教科文组织代表。杰拉德建议美国退出，因为她认为联合国教科文组织的计划正在从国际合作走向对抗。“以世界信息新秩序为例，他们在文件中说媒体应该成为国家的工具。当然，这完全违背了我们新闻自由的理念。越来越多的项目强调国家主义类型的问题解决方案。 例如，在教育领域，阿富汗的教师培训项目完全由苏联教师和苏联协调员负责。因此，从本质上讲，我们是在为阿富汗人民的思想灌输付出代价，这又不是我所认为的国际组织应该做的事情。”“你认为 Embo 在多大程度上对你所驳斥的方向负有责任？教科文组织？” “当然，我认为其中一些已经存在，但我认为它们在他的任期内得到了非常重视。当我们发出退出通知时，我们并没有抓住机会改革该组织，使其更有效、更公正地运作，反而出现了强烈的抗议，称不存在危机，而且最初很少需要改革。一些表面性的改革，以及对这个想法的普遍不满。” “你能描述一下恩博作为一个领导者，他的个性是什么样的，他作为一个领导者的特点是什么？” “我想说他确实非常有活力。他很有魅力，有非常个人化的管理风格，而且我认为他倾向于将批评视为针对个人。 1983年，当我们与他、助理国务卿和我本人讨论预算时，由于我们指出他的数字与我们正在讨论的数字有很大不同，他接着说，美国本质上，他的行为带有种族主义色彩，我们有很深的心理问题。” “你认为他的辞职是联合国教科文组织希望美国和英国回归的标志吗？” “据我了解，这不是辞职。这是一份声明，称他不会寻求第三个任期。 当然，这并不排除一些国家敦促他成为候选人，由执行委员会向大会提名候选人。”“你知道恩博是否受到任何直接压力，要求他不再寻求第三个任期吗？ ” “我知道不少国家政府一直表示不赞成他连任。其中包括北欧人，几个月前他们就去通知了他。其中包括日本。所以如果你称之为压力的话，肯定有几个国家表示不赞成他连任。”联合国教科文组织？” “坦白地说，我不会这么说。我认为他没有抓住机会成为改革的拥护者，这是一个遗憾。另一方面，这就是他的决定。” “你需要什么才能向美国建议这个国家重新加入联合国教科文组织？” “我认为要有一个好的总干事，才能看到在两个国家都进行认真的建设性改革。管理和计划中。我认为这种事情会影响很多人重新审视它。” 来自卢森堡的前美国驻联合国教科文组织代表 Jean Gerard 大使
