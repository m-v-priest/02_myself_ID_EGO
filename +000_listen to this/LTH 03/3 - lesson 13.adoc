"I think there is a global goal, which is *looked after* 照顾; 照管, and that is to punish France for its involvement in Middle-Eastern affairs, either Lebanon or the war between Iran and Iraq.  +

And France is, at the same time, more visible than any other European actors 演员, in Lebanon and in the Gulf." According to Moazi, the long French tradition of *granting 同意，准予 political asylum* (n.)(给予通常因政治原因不能回国的人的) 避难许可  has made France more open and accessible to terrorist activities.  +

美国参议院情报委员会今日公布了一份报告，呼吁美国安全政策及反情报行动, 进行全面变革，这是首个关于最近发生间谍案的分类评估。 委员会说，所造成的损失达数十亿美元，给美国带来了前所未有的安全威胁。

NPR's David Malthus has the story.  +

The report states (v.) that `主` damage done from espionage 间谍活动 and lax security `系`  is worse than anyone *in the government has yet acknowledged  承认（属实） publicly*.  +

尽管过去两年，里根政府加强了安全防范，辞令也更加强硬，但报告也得出结论，里根政府加强安全的具体措施不足。项目因缺乏资源而成效甚微。 +

情报委员会主席明尼苏达州共和党人Dave Durenberger以此概括了当前局势：
“太多的秘密，太多的盗密，太多的间谍，而保护我们国家机密的责任感少之又少，
在打击间谍对我们国家安全构成的真正威胁方面, 付出的努力太少.” +

Senator Durenberger said the Committee found *some progress has been made* in toughening (v.)加强，强化（法律、规定等）;使更坚强；使坚韧 up *security clearances* (n.)（录用或准许接触机密等以前的）审查许可，审核批准 for personnel 全体人员，职员, and some additional resources have been devoted 把…用于 to countering 抵制；抵消;反驳；驳斥 technical espionage 间谍活动, but he said **much more needs to be done** and he *described* the current security system *as* one "paralyzed 瘫痪的，不能活动的 by bureaucratic inertia (n.)惯性;缺乏活力；惰性；保守."

参议员Durenberger说，委员会在加强人员安全保障方面, 取得了一些进展，同时还调用了一些额外的资源，打击技术间谍活动，但他说，还有更多的工作要做. 他将当前的安全体系, 描述为“官僚主义惯性瘫痪”。 +



The Committee makes ninety-five specific recommendations 正式建议；提议, including *greater emphasis (n.)强调；重视；重要性  on* re-investigations of cleared personnel, a streamlined 流线型的；改进的；最新型的 classification 分类；归类；分级 system, *more money for* counter-intelligence elements of the FBI, CIA and the military services, and *tighter controls on* foreign diplomats from hostile countries.  +

And according to the FBI, 30% of them are professional intelligence officers.  +

It says approximately 大概；大约 eight hundred Soviets work for UN agencies, three hundred of them in New York, and one fourth of those are working for the KGB or the Soviet military intelligence, the GRU.  +

Next week, the Reagan Administration is to deliver 递送；传送 to the Congress its classified  机密的；保密的 report on counter-intelligence.  +
