There was mixed reaction at home and abroad on the lack of a concrete agreement from the meetings in Iceland.

[.my2]
对于冰岛会议未能达成具体协议，国内外反应不一。

On Capitol Hill, reaction broke down along party lines, with Democrats criticizing the President for missing a golden opportunity; Republicans praised him for not caving in to the Soviets.

[.my2]
在国会山，各党派的反应各不相同，民主党人批评总统错过了一个黄金机会；共和党人称赞他没有向苏联屈服。

America’s NATO allies were disappointed that promising arms reduction initiatives never materialized.

[.my2]
美国的北约盟国对承诺的军备削减计划从未兑现感到失望。

They especially regretted the lack of an agreement to eliminate medium-range US and Soviet missiles from Europe.

[.my2]
他们尤其对未能达成从欧洲消除美国和苏联中程导弹的协议感到遗憾。

But Kenneth Adelman, Director of the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, says too much criticism is unfounded.

[.my2]
但美国军控与裁军署署长肯尼思·阿德尔曼表示，过多的批评是没有根据的。

He says the meetings did yield two proposals which have moved the arms control process far beyond where it was before the meetings in Iceland.

[.my2]
他说，会议确实产生了两项提案，使军备控制进程远远超出了冰岛会议之前的水平。

"I think the prospects are better now because the Soviets have agreed to particular numbers on their 50% proposal for reductions of strategic weapons, and agreed to only, to have only a hundred warheads worldwide in the INF, or intermediate-range nuclear force.

[.my2]
“我认为现在的前景更好，因为苏联已经同意削减战略武器 50% 的具体数字，并且只同意在全球范围内仅拥有 100 枚中程核弹头。

Soviet negotiators cannot now say the Soviets need five hundred and thirteen warheads in Asia as they did last week if their leader says, no, they only need a hundred in Asia." Adelman says arms negotiators in Geneva can now pick up where the talks left off in Reykjavik.

[.my2]
如果苏联领导人说，不，他们在亚洲只需要一百枚弹头，那么苏联谈判代表现在就不能像上周那样说苏联在亚洲需要 513 枚弹头。”阿德尔曼表示，日内瓦的武器谈判代表现在可以继续谈判剩下的工作雷克雅未克出发。

Flood waters began to recede today in Alaska after three days of rain caused heavy damage, damage expected to reach into the millions of dollars.

[.my2]
经过三天的降雨造成严重损失后，阿拉斯加的洪水今天开始消退，预计损​​失将达到数百万美元。

"It’s getting better," said one emergency worker.

[.my2]
“情况正在好转，”一名急救人员说。

"Things are actually starting to look up." Alaska Governor Bill Sheffield planned to fly over the flood-stricken areas north and south of Anchorage.

[.my2]
“事情实际上开始好转。”阿拉斯加州州长比尔·谢菲尔德计划飞越安克雷奇北部和南部的洪水灾区。

So far, there are no reports of injuries.

[.my2]
到目前为止，还没有人员受伤的报告。

Many people have been evacuated from their homes. All the high schools and middle schools in South Africa in the black township of Soweto were shut down today as students staged a massive walkout.

[.my2]
许多人已从家中撤离。南非黑人小镇索韦托的所有高中和初中今天因学生举行大规模罢工而关闭。

Thousands of students reported to classes, but walked out in mid-morning as part of a protest.

[.my2]
数千名学生到校报到，但在上午中旬离开学校进行抗议。

Hundreds of people are homeless and thousands more stranded, after severe rain and windstorm lasting three days slammed portions of South Central Alaska.

[.my2]
持续三天的大雨和风暴袭击了阿拉斯加中南部部分地区，数百人无家可归，数千人被困。

Flooding that washed away bridges and roads and destroyed at least fifteen homes continues in many areas, and persistent bad weather is hampering rescue and damage assessment efforts.

[.my2]
在许多地区，洪水冲毁了桥梁和道路，并摧毁了至少 15 所房屋，持续的恶劣天气阻碍了救援和损失评估工作。

Tim Wolston, of member station KSKA in Anchorage.

[.my2]
蒂姆·沃尔斯顿 (Tim Wolston)，安克雷奇 KSKA 会员站的成员。

The worst deluge of rain in at least a decade began pelting South Central Alaska last Thursday night.

[.my2]
上周四晚，阿拉斯加中南部开始遭遇至少十年来最严重的降雨。

Sixty and seventy-mile-an-hour winds helped the rain wash away two bridges and the railroad line north of Anchorage, and completely cut off the town of Seward, southeast of here, from the outside.

[.my2]
时速六十到七十英里的大风帮助雨水冲毁了安克雷奇以北的两座桥梁和铁路线，并完全切断了东南部的苏厄德镇与外界的联系。

Seward Mayor Harry Giesler says very conservative estimate of fifteen million dollars in damage has been done so far.

[.my2]
苏厄德市市长哈里·吉斯勒表示，目前非常保守的估计损失为 1500 万美元。

"We’re looking at extensive road repair and rebuilding on all the arterial roads and even the main road coming into town.

[.my2]
“我们正在考虑对所有主干道甚至进城的主要道路进行广泛的道路维修和重建。

And the railroad, pardon the expression, caught h, e, double toothpicks.

[.my2]
铁路，请原谅我这样说，抓住了双牙签。

Heavy fog and continuing rain are hampering efforts to assess the damage and get supplies to those who need them.

[.my2]
大雾和持续降雨阻碍了评估损失和为需要的人提供物资的工作。

But Giesler says those that needed to be evacuated have been, while others are trying to ride out the storm.

[.my2]
但吉斯勒表示，那些需要撤离的人已经撤离，而其他人正在努力安然度过风暴。

"You know Alaskans are a very hearty bunch, and especially people that have things like dog teams and animals.

[.my2]
“你知道阿拉斯加人是一群非常热情的人，尤其是那些拥有狗队和动物之类的人。

They are very, very reluctant to leave their home as long as it’s even there.

[.my2]
只要家还在，他们就非常非常不愿意离开。

So we’re going, trying to get back and check on people, make sure they’re all right and that they have food and water and things like that." The water is still rising in spots, and Seward is expecting at least another twenty-four hours of rain.

[.my2]
所以我们要回去检查人们的情况，确保他们一切都好，有食物和水之类的东西。”有些地方的水位仍在上涨，苏厄德预计至少还会有另一场水灾。二十四小时的雨。

North of Anchorage, the damage is just as severe.

[.my2]
安克雷奇以北的损失同样严重。

Lieutenant Mike Holler of the state Division of the Emergency Services says several hundred homes in the valley north of Anchorage have been damaged.

[.my2]
州紧急服务部门的迈克·霍勒中尉表示，安克雷奇北部山谷中的数百所房屋遭到破坏。

"It remains to be seen, as people literally walk out of the woods or find dry ground and are evacuated, as to just what extent the damage will get total." Lieutenant Holler says two major bridges north of Anchorage were totally washed away by the raging waters, and tracks belonging to the Alaska Railroad, which provides a major form of transportation between Anchorage and Fairbanks, were destroyed.

[.my2]
“当人们真正走出树林或找到干燥的地面并被疏散时，损失的总体程度还有待观察。”霍勒中尉说，安克雷奇以北的两座主要桥梁被汹涌的海水完全冲毁，阿拉斯加铁路的轨道被摧毁，该铁路是安克雷奇和费尔班克斯之间的主要交通方式。

"Now, as far as the goods, shipment of goods and materials to sustain life in the interior of Alaska, that particular transportation avenue has been totally shut off, along with the highway as far as using overland trucking and so forth." Emergency shelters have been set up for those left homeless by the flooding.

[.my2]
“现在，就阿拉斯加内陆地区维持生命的货物、货物和材料的运输而言，这条特定的运输通道已经完全关闭，高速公路以及使用陆路卡车运输等都已被完全关闭。”已经为那些因洪水而无家可归的人设立了紧急避难所。

Alaska Governor Bill Sheffield has issued disaster declarations in order to free up state relief funds, and the state is hoping for federal aid.

[.my2]
阿拉斯加州州长比尔·谢菲尔德已发布灾难声明，以释放州救援资金，该州希望获得联邦援助。

Officials say because of the remoteness of many of the communities involved, it may be several days before the damage is fully assessed, and that’s if threatening clouds don’t release more rain.

[.my2]
官员们表示，由于许多受影响社区地处偏远，可能需要几天时间才能对损失进行全面评估，而且前提是威胁性的云层不会释放更多降雨。

For National Public Radio, this is Tim Wolston in Anchorage, Alaska. The conflict between Arab and Jew in Israel and the occupied territories is fought with bombs and jet fighter attacks and with high level political posturing.

[.my2]
我是国家公共广播电台的蒂姆·沃尔斯顿，来自阿拉斯加安克雷奇。以色列和被占领土上的阿拉伯人和犹太人之间的冲突是通过炸弹和喷气式战斗机袭击以及高层政治姿态进行的。

But there’s also a psychological struggle between the two.

[.my2]
但两人之间也存在心理斗争。

New York Times Correspondent David Shipler has written a book called Arab and Jew, which explores the stereotypes and myths that Israelis learn about Arabs, and that Arabs learn about Israelis.

[.my2]
《纽约时报》记者大卫·希普勒 (David Shipler) 写了一本名为《阿拉伯与犹太人》的书，探讨了以色列人对阿拉伯人以及阿拉伯人对以色列人的刻板印象和神话。

"These myths," said Shipler, "stem from and help perpetuate the political and military conflicts.

[.my2]
“这些神话，”希普勒说，“源于并助长了政治和军事冲突。

"Shipler says the two cultures teach their children to hate in the schools.

[.my2]
“希普勒说，这两种文化在学校里教导孩子们仇恨。

"Increasingly, Israeli Jews are beginning to realize that the battlefield is not only on the frontiers of their country ,but also in the minds of their children, that what happens in classrooms, how the Arab is portrayed in text-books, how the teachers talk about Arabs, how Arab children see Jews as they grow up—all of these elements are important in shaping the future, because the prejudices are very deep and are reinforced so thoroughly everyday that it’s hard to see a way out of them .There is textbook called The Arabs and Islam that’s used …​

[.my2]
“越来越多的以色列犹太人开始意识到，战场不仅在他们国家的边境，而且也在他们孩子的心中，教室里发生了什么，教科书上如何描绘阿拉伯人，老师们如何谈论阿拉伯人，阿拉伯儿童在成长过程中如何看待犹太人——所有这些因素对于塑造未来都很重要，因为偏见非常根深蒂固，而且每天都在强化，以至于很难找到摆脱它们的出路。名为《阿拉伯人和伊斯兰教》的教科书使用了……​

it’s published by the Israeli Ministry of Education and Culture and used in religious Jewish schools for seventh and eighth graders.

[.my2]
它由以色列教育和文化部出版，并在宗教犹太学校七年级和八年级学生中使用。

And that textbook portrays the Arab as essentially primitive and violent.

[.my2]
那本教科书将阿拉伯人描绘成本质上原始且暴力的人。

These two concepts go together in the sense that the Arab affection for violence and battle and warfare and robbery is highlighted.

[.my2]
这两个概念结合在一起，突出了阿拉伯人对暴力、战斗、战争和抢劫的喜爱。

And you don’t get any sense at all of the Arab as a modern, urban professional.

[.my2]
作为现代城市专业人士，你根本无法理解阿拉伯人。

The Arab is a desert warrior essentially, whose children grow up playing games.

[.my2]
阿拉伯人本质上是沙漠战士，他们的孩子是在游戏中长大的。

+

For example, there’s a passage that says the Bedouin man is proud to engage in robbery and so educates his children.

[.my2]
例如，有一段话说贝都因人以抢劫为荣，因此教育他的孩子。

Bedouin children like the game 'Hassu' —robbery raids.

[.my2]
贝都因儿童喜欢“Hassu”游戏——抢劫袭击。

They compete in running and wrestling and learn to use weapons at a very young age.

[.my2]
他们在很小的时候就参加跑步和摔跤比赛，并学习使用武器。

In another section, there’s a phrase that says, 'the women who lose their sons or husbands in the battle receive the hard news without weeping or cries.' In other words, the Arab doesn’t value human life somehow.

[.my2]
另一节中有这样一句话：“在战斗中失去儿子或丈夫的妇女们在收到这个沉重的消息时没有哭泣或哭泣。”换句话说，阿拉伯人并不重视人的生命。

Now that stereotype is fairly common to many cultures." "We heard that during the Vietnam War about the Vietnamese :they don’t value human life like we Westerners." "Exactly.

[.my2]
现在，这种刻板印象在许多文化中相当普遍。”“我们在越南战争期间听说越南人：他们不像我们西方人那样重视人的生命。”“没错。

During the Korean War about the Koreans, during World War II about the Japanese.

[.my2]
朝鲜战争期间关于朝鲜人，第二次世界大战期间关于日本人。

It’s a fairly common one.

[.my2]
这是一种相当常见的情况。

Of course, what it does is dehumanize the Arab in the eyes of Jewish children who are raised with these textbooks." "Now what happens when you go to schools of Arabs inside Israeli occupied territory? How did they portray the Jews, the Israelis?" "The textbooks that are used surreptitiously in Arab schools on the West Bank, for example, are published by Jordan." "You say, surreptitiously." "Yes, because the Israeli procedure is to take those Jordanian textbooks, expurgate the offensive passages and republish them.

[.my2]
当然，它的作用是在那些用这些教科书长大的犹太孩子眼中使阿拉伯人失去人性。”“现在，当你去以色列占领区内的阿拉伯人学校时会发生什么？他们如何描绘犹太人、以色列人？” “例如，约旦河西岸的阿拉伯学校偷偷使用的教科书就是约旦出版的。” “你说，偷偷地。” “是的，因为以色列的程序是拿走那些约旦教科书，删除冒犯性的段落并重新出版。

But in fact they have only three inspectors for a thousand schools to check to make sure that Arab teachers are not using the Jordanian versions.

[.my2]
但事实上，他们只有三名督察员对一千所学校进行检查，以确保阿拉伯教师没有使用约旦版本。

So they really can’t check up very thoroughly.

[.my2]
所以他们确实无法查得很彻底。

And the Jordanian versions do creep into the classrooms.

[.my2]
约旦版本也确实走进了教室。

What happens in those textbooks is that Jews are portrayed as violent and are hardly seen at all except in the context of the Arab-Israeli conflict.

[.my2]
这些教科书中发生的情况是，犹太人被描绘成暴力的人，除了在阿以冲突的背景下之外，几乎很少看到犹太人。

One of the interesting companion stereotypes to the Jew as violent that you see in Arab textbooks is the Jew as a coward.

[.my2]
你在阿拉伯教科书中看到的关于犹太人暴力的有趣的刻板印象之一是犹太人是胆小鬼。

This idea is quite pervasive.

[.my2]
这种想法相当普遍。

The Jew is strong because he has advanced weapons, but in his soul, in his heart he’s a coward, and so he hides behind these weapons." "Is there any way to gauge whether these stereotypes, whether the school’s socialization process is really working? In other words, can you somehow measure if the …​

[.my2]
犹太人很强大，因为他拥有先进的武器，但在他的灵魂里，在他的内心里，他是一个胆小鬼，所以他躲在这些武器后面。”“有没有办法衡量这些刻板印象，学校的社会化进程是否真正发挥作用？换句话说，你能以某种方式衡量...​

how these teachings of the schools are affecting the way Arab and Israeli children interact with each other, that it makes them hostile toward each other?" "In the first place Arab and Israeli children hardly ever have contact and rarely have an opportunity to interact, because they live separately, they go to separate schools, and what not.

[.my2]
学校的这些教义如何影响阿拉伯和以色列儿童彼此互动的方式，使他们彼此敌视？” “首先，阿拉伯和以色列儿童几乎没有接触，也很少有互动的机会，因为他们分开住，上不同的学校，等等。

But I think there’s no question that the school setting on both sides encourages bigotry.

[.my2]
但我认为，毫无疑问，双方的学校环境都鼓励偏见。

There was one example that brought it home to me of an Israeli girl who was ten years old, who came home from school one day after an attack on Arab mayors on the West Bank, and she said, 'Mommy, are we glad or not glad that it happened?'" "She didn’t know." "Her mother said, 'We’re absolutely not glad.

[.my2]
有一个让我印象深刻的例子，一位十岁的以色列女孩在约旦河西岸的阿拉伯市长遭到袭击后一天放学回家，她说：‘妈妈，我们高兴还是不高兴？很高兴这件事发生了？’” “她不知道。” “她妈妈说，‘我们绝对不高兴。

Violence is never the way.' And the next day she came home from school, and she said, 'Mommy, you’re wrong.

[.my2]
暴力永远不是出路。第二天她放学回家，她说：‘妈妈，你错了。

We are glad it happened.' I don’t know where she picked it up, whether from other children or from a teacher.

[.my2]
我们很高兴这件事发生了。我不知道她是从哪里学来的，是从其他孩子那里学来的，还是从老师那里学来的。

But there are some schools, and in especially religious schools in Israel devoted to teaching children of right-wing ultranationalists, where the instruction is quite ideological in terms of rejecting the Arab as an alien who really doesn’t belong in this land except as a subordinate to the Jew.

[.my2]
但也有一些学校，特别是以色列的宗教学校，致力于教育右翼极端民族主义者的孩子，这些学校的教学相当意识形态化，拒绝将阿拉伯人视为外国人，除了作为阿拉伯人之外，实际上不属于这片土地。从属于犹太人。

Young people have told me that they’re taught that the Arab is Amalek, the ancient enemy of the Jews in the Bible who is to be exterminated." "You have been talking a lot about school textbooks, for instance, what’s taught in the schools as a way of perpetuating these stereotypes.

[.my2]
年轻人告诉我，他们被教导说，阿拉伯人是亚玛力人，是圣经中犹太人的远古敌人，应该被消灭。”学校作为延续这些陈规定型观念的一种方式。

In our own country, of course, there’s been a big effort in the past ten-twenty years to purge textbooks in the classrooms of the sort of stereotypes we have had of blacks, for instance, or Indians.

[.my2]
当然，在我们自己的国家，过去十二十年里我们付出了巨大的努力，清除课堂教科书中对黑人或印度人的刻板印象。

Is there anybody in Israel who is trying to do a similar thing with the Israeli textbooks?" "Yes, there is an entire effort being conducted by the Vanier Foundation with the Ministry of Education’s cooperation to take these stereotypes out of text books, to write new ones, to revise the curriculum from top to bottom, beginning in the youngest grades in an effort to sensitize Israeli Jewish children to the richness and diversity of Arab culture and to portray Arabs as more than just enemies, but also as fellow citizens and neighbors." "And this is something the government condones?" "Well, half-heartedly.

[.my2]
以色列是否有人试图对以色列教科书做类似的事情？” “是的，瓦尼尔基金会正在与教育部合作进行全面的努力，以消除教科书中的这些刻板印象，编写新课程，从最低年级开始，从上到下修改课程，努力让以色列犹太儿童了解阿拉伯文化的丰富性和多样性，并将阿拉伯人描绘成不仅仅是敌人，而且是同胞和邻居” “这是政府纵容的事情吗？” “嗯，半心半意的。

There is a support for it officially in the Education Ministry, but the religious schools are reluctant to do it.

[.my2]
教育部对此表示正式支持，但宗教学校不愿意这样做。

And there’s been some resistance on the part of some educators at the level of school principal or teacher.

[.my2]
一些校长或教师级别的教育工作者也存在一些阻力。

So it’s a mixed picture.

[.my2]
所以这是一个复杂的情况。

It’s gone to the point where quite a few eleventh grade classes now are following an elective curriculum in which they begin the first day by writing down all the words that come to mind when they think of Arabs.

[.my2]
现在，相当多的十一年级班级都在遵循选修课程，他们在第一天开始时写下他们想到阿拉伯人时想到的所有单词。

The teacher then puts them up on the blackboard, and the kids have to sit there and stare at their own prejudices.

[.my2]
然后老师把它们放在黑板上，孩子们必须坐在那里盯着自己的偏见。

And that’s the beginning of a process of dealing with the stereotypes they’ve grown up with." David Shipler.

[.my2]
这是处理他们成长过程中的刻板印象过程的开始。”大卫·希普勒。

His new book is called Arab and Jews : Wounded Spirits in A Promised Land .

[.my2]
他的新书名为《阿拉伯和犹太人：应许之地中受伤的灵魂》。
