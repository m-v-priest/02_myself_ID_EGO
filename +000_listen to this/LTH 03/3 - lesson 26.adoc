Virginia State authorities and agents from five federal law enforcement organizations
raided the Leesburg, Virginia headquarters of independent presidential candidate, Lyndon LaRouche, this morning.  +

NPR's Frank Browning reports.  +

"Three key members of the LaRouche organization were arrested this morning as scores of law enforcement agents swept in for a 6:45 am raid.  +

Jeffrey and Michelle Steinberg were arrested on federal charges of credit card fraud and tax evasion.  +

And another member of LaRouche's inner circle was also charged with obstruction of justice.  +

A federal grand jury in Boston has been investigating the LaRouche organization for several months in relation to charges that it has been involved in a variety of financial frauds of unsuspecting supporters.  +

Ten of LaRouche's followers have been charged with fraud so far.  +

The criminal scheme, allegedly involved some 200,000 unauthorized credit card charges totaling more than $1,000,000.  +

The Internal Revenue Service and Virginia authorities are also investigating a variety of other criminal charges.  +

I'm Frank Browning reporting." The Supreme Court began its 1986-87 term today under new Chief Justice William Rehnquist.  +

The court agreed to decide whether government-run airports may prohibit the distribution of literature inside terminals.  +

The Justices will also consider the right of ethnic and religious minorities to file racial discrimination suits.  +

Japan has lowered its prime lending rate in a move designed to stimulate its economy and improve demand for US imports.  +

The cut from 3.5% to 3% is part of a sweeping agreement reached today between the United States and Japan.  +

In addition to cutting its prime rate, Japan has agreed to coordinate its foreign exchange policy with the US Today is the first Monday in October, and that means the opening day of the new Supreme Court term.  +

NPR's legal affairs correspondent, Nina Totenberg was at the court this morning when the gavel went down.  +

Nina: "Well, as you know, by now, Terry, this was a rather special beginning with a new Chief Justice, William Rehnquist at the helm, and a new Justice, Antonin Scalia, in the junior Justice's chair." "So what was it like?" "Well, I gotta tell you.  +

To someone who had never been at the court before, it may have looked quite normal.  +

But to me, it was really quite strange.  +

Very weird, in fact.  +

For fifteen years, we watched this Court with Chief Justice Burger in the center of the bench.  +

And now the whole Court has played a kind of musical chairs, with justice Rehnquist, who used to sit at the far right, moving to the center to run the Court.  +

Chief Justice Burger is gone.  +

Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who I used to look across the room at and used to look rather placid to me across the room, is now sitting just over my shoulder above me.  +

Chief Justice Rehnquist seemed a tad nervous as he opened the term this morning.  +

As far as the new Justice, Antonin Scalia, he waited
only about ten minutes during the first case argued this morning before he joined in peppering the lawyers with questions.  +

Actually he started to ask a question even earlier, but was cut off by Justice O'Connor, and sort of hung back while a couple of other Justices asked questions.  +

And then, Justice Seebans, who sits next to Justice Scalia, looked at Scalia as if to say 'Okay Kid, your turn now.' "Well, I can report to you, in general, that the Justices looked well rested and rather pleased at the look of the new Court.  +

This morning's session was spirited with all of the Justices asking questions and a couple of them smiling rather broadly at the sight of Justice Scalia tearing into the attorneys arguing their cases." "Okay.  +

What about the upcoming term? What cases can we look forward to?" "Well, you know, Alexis de Tocqueville once wrote that, in the United States, almost every pressing social question eventually reaches the Supreme Court.  +

And while last term was an unusual blockbuster of a year, this term is no slouch either." "Later this month, the Court will hear what is probably the last broad based challenge to the death penalty.  +

The Court must decide if capital punishment should be invalidated if statistics show that it's imposed disproportionately more often on blacks than on whites, or more often on the killers of whites than on the killers of blacks.  +

The decision in this case, will have an enormous impact on the more than 1,700 men and women currently on death row." "Last year, the Court issued major decisions in the affirmative action area.  +

What about this year?" "Well, last year, the Court ruled than affirmative action is generally acceptable in hiring, but not in lay-offs.  +

This year, the Court will focus its attention on affirmative action in promotions and when that kind of affirmative action, if ever, is permissible.  +

The Court will also hear a major sex discrimination case involving pregnancy.  +

At issue is a California law that requires all employers to provide women up to four months disability leave for pregnancy.  +

A California bank is challenging the law, claiming that it discriminates against men who do not get that kind of disability leave when they are ill.  +

The bank claims that the California law violates a federal law which bans any sort of discrimination based on pregnancy.  +

Then, there's another case that involves the federal law banning discrimination against the handicapped in employment.  +

The question in this case is whether people who have a communicable disease, like AIDS or tuberculosis, can be denied jobs because of their disease.  +

In this case, a school system fired a teacher who had tuberculosis." "What about the area of separation of Church and State, cases involving religion?" "There are a whole slew of these cases again this year, but two stand out as particularly interesting.  +

One case pits the evangelical Christian community against the nation's educators.  +

Louisiana passed a law that requires all schools that teach the theory of evolution to teach creationism alongside it as an alternative theory: creationism being the theory that God created man whole without any evolution.  +

When this law was passed in Louisiana, it was challenged in court by the Quasi-independent state school board, which argued that creationism has no scientific basis, only a religious basis.  +

A federal court struck down the law ruling that it, in effect, amounted to an endorsement of religion, and Louisiana's governor
appealed to the Supreme Court." "In a second religion case, the Court will decide if religious and political groups have the right to distribute literature inside government run airport terminals.  +

Sound familiar? When Los Angeles tried to ban the distribution of such literature, a minister from Jews for Jesus challenged the ban in court.  +

The lower courts ruled that airports are public forums much like parks and sidewalks, and that the government could not can the distribution of political or religious literature there.  +

Los Angeles appealed to the Supreme Court, and today the High Court agreed to review the case.  +

There'll be lots of other fascinating cases this year on questions as diverse as gambling on Indian preservations to presidential versus congressional powers.  +

Today, as I said, was just the beginning." "Thank you, NPR's legal affairs correspondent, Nina Totenberg." Scientists at the National Cancer Institute said they have found a new method for treating cancers of the lung, liver and colon in test animals.  +

The scientists report the method cured cancer of the liver and colon in mice.  +

NPR's Lori Garrett has details.  +

Doctor Steven Rosenberg has done it again.  +

Last year, Rosenberg stunned the medical community with word he had successfully treated some human cancer patients with a revolutionary type of therapy.  +

But some of the patients suffered serious side effects from the treatment.  +

One died as a result.  +

So Rosenberg has been busy working on improvements.  +

Today, in Science magazine, Rosenberg reports studies in mice show he may have found the right treatment.  +

Rosenberg is working on ways to trick the body's immune system into successfully attacking tumor cells.  +

The immune system is complicated.  +

Any successful attack on cancer cells involves a vast army of special immune chemicals and cells.  +

A key chemical is Interleukin-2.  +

It stimulates cells of the immune system to do their jobs and kill enemy targets such as cancer cells.  +

Interleukin-2 is now readily available, cheaply manufactured because it can be made through genetic engineering techniques.  +

Rosenberg and his colleagues initially tried to grow human white blood cells in the laboratory in dishes full of Interleukin-2.  +

The idea was to stimulate those white blood cells, make them good fighters, and then inject them back into the cancer patients where they would tackle the enemy tumor cells.  +

It worked, but the doses of Interleukin-2 that were required were toxic, even deadly.  +

Now, Rosenberg is trying something new on mice.  +

Instead of withdrawing white blood cells and treating them in the laboratory, Rosenberg removes pieces of the actual tumors.  +

He then grows those tumor cells in the lab in dishes full of Interleukin-2.  +

In a few days, the tumor cells die, leaving only a handful of lymphocytes.  +

These are cells that were attached to the tumors, but were previously unable to kill them.  +

Now, activated by their incubation with Interleukin-2, these lymphocytes are ready to fight.  +

Rosenberg injects these specially primed lymphocytes into the mice.  +

He also injects more Interleukin-2, but in small enough doses that no side effects are noticed.  +

And he injects one more thing: a chemical that
suppresses the rest of the immune system so that nothing will interfere with the work of the primed killer cells.  +

The results are nothing short of astonishing.  +

Now remember this is mice, but for all mice with advanced cancers of the colon, this treatment eliminated 100% of the tumors.  +

Half of the mice with lung cancer were cured.  +

All of the mice with cancer of the liver were cured.  +

Now, Rosenberg's laboratory is growing similar killer cells for human beings, and the National Cancer Institute plans to begin human experimental treatment soon.  +

Although this study appears quite hopeful, it must be remembered that this work so far only involves mice.  +

Whether results will be as dramatic in human beings remains to be seen.  +

I'm Gorrett reporting.


弗吉尼亚州当局和五个联邦执法组织的特工今天早上突袭了独立总统候选人林登·拉鲁什位于弗吉尼亚州利斯堡的总部。 NPR 的弗兰克·勃朗宁报道。 “今天早上，数十名执法人员在早上 6 点 45 分进行突袭，拉鲁什组织的三名主要成员被捕。杰弗里·斯坦伯格和米歇尔·斯坦伯格因联邦指控信用卡欺诈和逃税而被捕。拉鲁什组织的另一名成员核心圈子还被指控妨碍司法公正。波士顿的一个联邦大陪审团已经对拉鲁什组织进行了几个月的调查，指控该组织参与了对毫无戒心的支持者的各种财务欺诈。拉鲁什的十名追随者已被到目前为止，该犯罪计划被指控欺诈。据称，该犯罪计划涉及约 200,000 笔未经授权的信用卡收费，总金额超过 1,000,000 美元。国税局和弗吉尼亚当局还在调查各种其他刑事指控。我是弗兰克·布朗宁报道。最高法院今天在新任首席大法官威廉·伦奎斯特 (William Rehnquist) 的领导下开始了 1986-87 年任期。法院同意决定政府运营的机场是否可以禁止在航站楼内分发文献。大法官还将考虑种族和宗教少数群体提起种族歧视诉讼的权利。日本降低了最优惠贷款利率，此举旨在刺激经济并改善对美国进口产品的需求。从 3.5% 削减至 3% 是美国和日本今天达成的全面协议的一部分。 除了下调最优惠利率外，日本还同意与美国协调外汇政策。今天是10月的第一个星期一，这意味着最高法院新任期的开始。今天早上，当木槌落下时，NPR 法律事务记者 Nina Totenberg 正在法庭上。尼娜：“好吧，正如你所知，特里，现在这是一个相当特别的开始，新任首席大法官威廉·伦奎斯特掌舵，新任大法官安东尼·斯卡利亚担任初级大法官。” “那么那是什么样子的呢？” “好吧，我得告诉你。对于以前从未去过法庭的人来说，这可能看起来很正常。但对我来说，这真的很奇怪。事实上，非常奇怪。十五年来，我们一直看着这个法庭首席大法官伯格坐在法官席中央。现在整个法院就像抢椅子一样，原来坐在最右边的大法官伦奎斯特搬到了中间主持法院。首席大法官伯格是走了。法官桑德拉·戴·奥康纳（Sandra Day O'Connor），我过去常常看着房间的另一边，在房间另一边对我来说看起来相当平静，现在就坐在我的肩膀上方。首席大法官伦奎斯特（Rehnquist）在开口时似乎有点紧张今天早上的这个词。至于新任大法官安东尼·斯卡利亚（Antonin Scalia），在今天早上的第一个案件辩论中，他只等了大约十分钟，就开始向律师们提问。实际上他更早开始提问，但被被奥康纳法官打断，在其他几位法官提问时有点犹豫。然后，坐在斯卡利亚法官旁边的西班斯法官看着斯卡利亚，好像在说：“好吧，孩子，现在轮到你了。”” “好吧，我可以向你报告，总的来说，法官们看起来休息得很好，对新法院的面貌相当满意。今天早上的会议气氛热烈，所有法官都提出了问题，其中一些法官笑得很开心。看到斯卡利亚法官撕扯正在辩论的律师们。” “好的。接下来的学期呢？有哪些案例值得我们期待呢？” “嗯，你知道，亚历克西斯·德·托克维尔曾经写道，在美国，几乎所有紧迫的社会问题最终都会到达最高法院。虽然上一届任期是一年中不同寻常的重磅炸弹，但这一届也毫不逊色。” “本月晚些时候，法院将听取可能是对死刑的最后一次广泛质疑。如果统计数据显示死刑适用于黑人的次数多于白人，或者更多，法院必须决定是否应废除死刑。” “针对杀害白人的凶手，而不是针对杀害黑人的凶手。本案的判决将对目前被关押在死囚牢房的 1,700 多名男女产生巨大影响。” “去年，法院在平权行动领域做出了重大裁决。今年呢？” “好吧，去年，法院裁定平权行动在招聘方面普遍可以接受，但在裁员方面则不然。今年，法院将把注意力集中在晋升方面的平权行动，以及当这种平权行动（如果有的话）是允许的。法院还将审理一起涉及怀孕的重大性别歧视案件。争议焦点是加利福尼亚州的一项法律，该法律要求所有雇主为女性提供最多四个月的怀孕伤残假。 加州一家银行正在对该法律提出质疑，声称该法律歧视那些生病时无法享受伤残假的男性。该银行声称，加州的法律违反了禁止基于怀孕的任何形式歧视的联邦法律。然后，还有一个案件涉及联邦法律禁止就业歧视残疾人。本案的问题是，患有艾滋病或肺结核等传染病的人是否会因为疾病而被拒绝工作。在这起案件中，学校系统解雇了一名患有肺结核的教师。” “政教分离领域，涉及宗教的案件怎么样？” “今年又出现了大量此类案件，但有两起案件最为突出，特别有趣。其中一个案例使福音派基督教团体与国家教育工作者对立起来。路易斯安那州通过了一项法律，要求所有教授进化论的学校同时教授神创论作为替代理论：神创论是上帝在没有任何进化的情况下创造了整个人类的理论。当这项法律在路易斯安那州通过时，它在法庭上受到准独立州立学校董事会的质疑，该董事会认为神创论没有科学基础，只有宗教基础。联邦法院驳回了该法律的裁决，认为该法律实际上相当于对宗教的认可，路易斯安那州州长向最高法院提出上诉。”“在第二个宗教案件中，法院将决定宗教和政治团体是否有权利在政府运营的机场航站楼内分发宣传品。听起来有点熟？当洛杉矶试图禁止分发此类文学作品时，一位支持耶稣的犹太人牧师在法庭上对这一禁令提出质疑。 下级法院裁定，机场是公共场所，就像公园和人行道一样，政府不能在那里分发政治或宗教文献。洛杉矶向最高法院提出上诉，今天高等法院同意复审此案。今年还会出现许多其他引人入胜的案例，涉及的问题多种多样，从对印第安人保留地的赌博到总统与国会权力的博弈。正如我所说，今天只是一个开始。”“谢谢你，NPR 法律事务记者 Nina Totenberg。”美国国家癌症研究所的科学家表示，他们在测试中发现了一种治疗肺癌、肝癌和结肠癌的新方法动物。科学家们报告了这种方法治愈了小鼠的肝癌和结肠癌。NPR 的洛里·加勒特 (Lori Garrett) 提供了详细信息。史蒂文·罗森伯格 (Steven Rosenberg) 医生再次做到了这一点。去年，罗森伯格用他成功治疗了一些人类癌症患者的消息震惊了医学界一种革命性的疗法。但是一些患者因治疗而出现了严重的副作用。其中一人因此死亡。因此罗森伯格一直忙于改进。今天，在《科学》杂志上，罗森伯格报道了对小鼠的研究表明他可能已经发现正确的治疗方法。罗森伯格正在研究欺骗人体免疫系统成功攻击肿瘤细胞的方法。免疫系统很复杂。对癌细胞的任何成功攻击都涉及大量特殊的免疫化学物质和细胞。一种关键化学物质是白细胞介素-2 (Interleukin-2)。它刺激免疫系统细胞发挥作用并杀死癌细胞等敌人目标。 Interleukin-2 现在很容易获得，且制造成本低廉，因为它可以通过基因工程技术制造。 Rosenberg 和他的同事最初尝试在实验室里装满 Interleukin-2 的培养皿中培养人类白细胞。这个想法是刺激这些白细胞，使它们成为优秀的战士，然后将它们注射回癌症患者体内，在那里它们可以对抗敌人的肿瘤细胞。它确实有效，但所需剂量的白细胞介素 2 是有毒的，甚至是致命的。现在，罗森伯格正在老鼠身上尝试一些新的东西。罗森伯格没有抽取白细胞并在实验室中对其进行治疗，而是切除了实际肿瘤的碎片。然后，他在实验室里装满白细胞介素 2 的培养皿中培养这些肿瘤细胞。几天后，肿瘤细胞死亡，只留下少量淋巴细胞。这些细胞附着在肿瘤上，但之前无法杀死它们。现在，这些淋巴细胞通过与 Interleukin-2 一起孵育而被激活，准备好战斗。罗森伯格将这些经过特殊处理的淋巴细胞注射到小鼠体内。他还注射了更多的 Interleukin-2，但剂量足够小，没有注意到任何副作用。他还注射了另一种东西：一种抑制免疫系统其余部分的化学物质，这样就不会干扰已启动的杀伤细胞的工作。结果简直令人惊讶。现在请记住，这是小鼠，但对于所有患有晚期结肠癌的小鼠，这种治疗消除了 100% 的肿瘤。一半患有肺癌的老鼠被治愈了。所有患有肝癌的小鼠都被治愈了。现在，罗森伯格的实验室正在为人类培养类似的杀伤细胞，国家癌症研究所计划很快开始人体实验治疗。尽管这项研究看起来很有希望，但必须记住，迄今为止这项工作仅涉及小鼠。 人类的结果是否会如此引人注目还有待观察。我是戈勒特报道。
