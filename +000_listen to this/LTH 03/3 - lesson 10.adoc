Lesson10


President Reagan said today he will veto a defense spending bill if it is approved, as expected, by the House.  +

Speaking to a private group in Washington today, the President said he was concerned about provisions in the bill that would ban nuclear testing and cut funding for his Star Wars defense system.  +

The President also charged that the Soviet-backed ban on nuclear testing is "a backdoor to a nuclear freeze." And he accused the Soviets of a major propaganda campaign on the testing issue.  +

Israeli warplanes bombed suspected Palestinian guerrilla bases in Southeast Beirut today.  +

Police said the bomb set at least four targets on fire.  +

There are reports that two people were wounded in the attacks.
At a news conference in Pretoria today, South African Foreign Minister Pic Botha called international sanctions against his country "a mad perverse action" that will put many blacks out of work.  +

But Botha said the South African government "accepts the challenge to overcome the effect of sanctions." White House spokesman Larry Speakes said today President Reagan will veto on Friday a sanctions bill passed by Congress, but he admitted it will be tough to sustain the veto.  +

On Wall Street today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up four and a half points, closing at 1797.81.  +

Trading was moderate, one hundred thirty-two million shares.  +

Israeli warplanes today bombed four suspected Palestinian guerrilla bases in Lebanon.  +

Reports from Beirut say at least two people were wounded and a number of fires started in the four villages.  +

From Jerusalem, Jerry Cheslow filed this report which was subject to censorship by Israeli authorities.  +

According to the Israeli army spokesman, the targets were bases belonging to two pro-Syrian Palestinian guerrilla organizations.  +

Israeli military sources say one of the targets was a staging base for raids against northern Israel.  +

Lebanese radio stations reported that at least two people were wounded in the attack south of Beirut and that Beirut International Airport was closed for half an hour.  +

Israeli military sources stress that the air raid had nothing to do with this week's tensions along Israel's border with Lebanon.  +

They were between the Shi'ite Muslim Hizbullah (Party of God) Militia and the Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army Militia.  +

Over the past two weeks, large Hizbullah forces stormed dozens of South Lebanese Army positions.  +

Israeli military sources say that at least fifteen South Lebanese Army men and some fifty members of Hizbullah were killed.  +

According to the sources the attacks also badly damaged the morale of the South Lebanese Army, and this led Israel to deploy a large force along its border with Lebanon.  +

The force included troops, armor and artillery, and according to knowledgeable observers it was equipped for offensive action against Hizbullah.  +

Senior Israeli defense sources say that Hizbullah was trying to take over all of southern Lebanon.  +

Hizbullah has also been attacking Unifil, the UN force in Southern Lebanon.  +

Over the past six weeks, four French Unifil troops were killed by Hizbullah, and just this morning a French UN base was rocketed in Southern Lebanon.  +

There were no casualty, but some of its soldiers were blown off their seats.  +

And the sources said that Hizbullah's domination of Southern Lebanon would be a direct threat to Israel.  +

Some of its men who were killed were wearing kerchiefs with the words "Onward to Jerusalem" printed on them.  +

But since the Israeli troops deployed along the border three days ago, there have been no Hizbullah attacks on the South
Lebanese Army.  +

By nightfall here in the Middle East, the Israeli troops had returned to their bases.  +

This week, Californian wine workers vote on a contract proposal from winery owners.  +

The workers have now been on strike for six weeks.  +

The contract proposal calls for cuts in wages and cuts in benefits.  +

The prospects for rank and file approval seem slim.  +

A central issue of the strike is the economic well-being of the California wine industry.  +

William Drummond reports.  +

A gondola containing tons of freshly picked Chardenay grapes is dumped into a hopper as the process begins for bottling the 1986 vintage.  +

The harvest has continued despite the fact that more than two thousand winery workers have struck twelve of the biggest wineries in Northern and Central California.  +

Relying on automated plants and non-union labor, members of the Winery Owners' Association have succeeded in carrying on what looks like business is usual.  +

But out on the picket line, union worker Pat Scoley is anything but pleased.  +

"I guess they're doing all right.  +

If they aren't, they want us to think they are.  +

I hope to hell they aren't, between you and me." The union contract expired at the end of July, which is the beginning of the harvest, the time when wine makers usually need all the help they can get.  +

But many plants are like the Charles Krug Winery, which has been completely automated.  +

Owner Peter Mondaby says the strike has no effect on producing the product.  +

"We feel that we can go on indefinitely, because there's a lot of people who want to work.  +

And it's only a question of training these people and, of course, with the system that we have, very well computerized, that they can fit in with a reasonable amount of training, that they can fit in.  +

So, I mean, we're not concerned about it." Actually, the heavy rainfall several days ago in the Napa Valley seemed to disturb the owners more than the strike.  +

Mondaby produces around a million cases a year, super premium brands under the Charles Krug label, mid-range premium wines and jug wines.  +

Mondaby says the industry took a beating during the last several years because of cheap wine imports from Europe.  +

Even though Americans today are drinking more wine chiefly in the form of wine coolers, wine makers say there's not that much profit in the coolers, and they're still in a financial pinch.  +

"I feel that the industry has hit its low point and now in on the uptrend.  +

Of course, it's not an uptrend that you will see overnight, but it is a healthy uptrend in a gradual growth manner now.  +

But I wouldn't necessarily say a greater profitability because the profit is very, very marginal.  +

The volume is there, it's true, but the profit is very, very marginal.  +

Mondaby's marginal profit argument does not win much support among striking workers, like Hannah Stockton, who works in the bottling plant at Christian Brothers.  +

"I don't believe it, 'because I read the paper every day, and I listen to the news.  +

I mean, there has been increase in sale.  +

I mean, ...  +

I believe three or four years back, we had a slump in the industry.  +

But wine is coming back.  +

Now they are coming out with wine coolers; they are making money.  +

We don't want a raise; we just want to
keep what we've got." Wages for workers in the winery industry range from around eight dollars to fifteen dollars an hour.  +

The union was willing to give up a slight reduction in wages, but refused to accept cuts in the pension and health benefits.  +

The employers reportedly want a twenty percent reduction in the wages and benefits package.  +

Winery owners say the union has to recognize that overall costs have increased.  +

"Not only is your gross down; the competition has forced us to increase marketing and advertising, which is further eroding whatever margin was there." David Spualding is general manager of a winery in Calistoga.  +

Spaulding Vineyards is tiny compared to Charles Krug and Gallo, and Spaulding Vineyards is not on strike, but David Spaulding says he faces the same market forces as the big guys.  +

"I think the big problem is the same problem that faces agriculture all over this country; and that is surplus.  +

You know we are producing more and producing it more efficiently, and we have a production that exceeds the demand in the market." Spaulding says wine coolers have taken up some of the over-production, but not all of it.  +

As for the union leaders, they don't think it's good idea to give back wages and benefits when the demand for the product is on the increase.  +

Winery workers are voting all this week on the wages and benefits cuts proposed by management.  +

Jerry Davis is an official of the union.  +

"From the people I talked to today and what the negotiating committee is stating, we ask a NO vote on this proposal." The results are expected to be known by Thursday.  +

里根总统今天表示，如果国防支出法案如预期获得众议院批准，他将否决该法案。总统今天在华盛顿对一个私人团体发表讲话时表示，他对该法案中禁止核试验并削减星球大战防御系统资金的条款感到担忧。总统还指责苏联支持的核试验禁令是“核冻结的后门”。他还指责苏联在测试问题上开展了大规模的宣传活动。今天，以色列战机轰炸了贝鲁特东南部疑似巴勒斯坦游击队基地。警方称，炸弹至少导致四个目标着火。有报道称，袭击中有两人受伤。今天在比勒陀利亚举行的新闻发布会上，南非外交部长皮克·博塔称针对南非的国际制裁是“疯狂的反常行动”，这将使许多黑人失业。但博塔表示，南非政府“接受克服制裁影响的挑战”。白宫发言人拉里·斯皮克斯今天表示，里根总统将于周五否决国会通过的一项制裁法案，但他承认维持否决将很困难。今天在华尔街，道琼斯工业平均指数上涨四个半点，收于 1797.81 点。交易量温和，为一亿三千二百万股。以色列战机今天轰炸了黎巴嫩境内四个疑似巴勒斯坦游击队基地。来自贝鲁特的报道称，至少两人受伤，四个村庄发生多起火灾。杰里·切斯洛在耶路撒冷提交了这份报告，该报告受到以色列当局的审查。据以色列军方发言人称，袭击目标是两个亲叙利亚的巴勒斯坦游击队组织的基地。 以色列军方消息人士称，其中一个目标是袭击以色列北部的一个集结基地。黎巴嫩广播电台报道称，贝鲁特以南的袭击事件造成至少两人受伤，贝鲁特国际机场关闭半小时。以色列军方消息人士强调，此次空袭与本周以色列与黎巴嫩边境的紧张局势无关。他们是什叶派穆斯林真主党（真主党）民兵和以色列支持的南黎巴嫩陆军民兵之间的成员。过去两周，真主党大军袭击了南黎巴嫩军队的数十个阵地。以色列军方消息称，至少有 15 名南黎巴嫩军人和约 50 名真主党成员被杀。消息人士称，这些袭击还严重打击了南黎巴嫩军队的士气，导致以色列在黎巴嫩边境部署了大批部队。这支部队包括部队、装甲车和大炮，据知情人士称，这支部队的装备是针对真主党的进攻行动。以色列高级国防消息人士称，真主党正试图占领整个黎巴嫩南部。真主党还一直在攻击驻黎巴嫩南部的联合国部队联黎部队。在过去的六周里，四名法国联黎部队士兵被真主党杀害，就在今天早上，黎巴嫩南部的一个法国联合国基地也遭到火箭弹袭击。没有人员伤亡，但一些士兵被炸飞了。消息人士称，真主党对黎巴嫩南部的统治将对以色列构成直接威胁。一些被杀的人戴着印有“前往耶路撒冷”字样的头巾。 但自从三天前以色列军队在边境部署以来，真主党还没有对南黎巴嫩军队发动袭击。中东地区夜幕降临时，以色列军队已返回基地。我是国家公共广播电台的杰里·切斯洛，在耶路撒冷。本周，加州葡萄酒工人对酒庄主的合同提案进行投票。工人们现在已经罢工六周了。合同提案要求削减工资和福利。获得普通民众批准的前景似乎很渺茫。罢工的一个核心问题是加州葡萄酒行业的经济福祉。威廉·德拉蒙德报道。当 1986 年份葡萄酒装瓶的过程开始时，装有大量新鲜采摘的霞多丽葡萄的贡多拉被倒入料斗中。尽管两千多名酿酒厂工人罢工了加州北部和中部十二个最大的酿酒厂，但收获仍在继续。依靠自动化工厂和非工会劳动力，酒庄业主协会的成员成功地开展了看似平常的生意。但在纠察线上，工会工人帕特·斯考利却一点也不高兴。 “我想他们做得很好。如果他们做得不好，他们希望我们认为他们做得很好。我希望他们做得很好，我和你保密。”工会合同于七月底到期，此时正是收获的开始，此时酿酒师通常需要他们能得到的所有帮助。但很多工厂就像查尔斯·克鲁格酒厂一样，已经完全自动化了。店主彼得·蒙达比 (Peter Mondaby) 表示，罢工对产品生产没有影响。 “我们觉得我们可以无限期地继续下去，因为有很多人想要工作。 这只是培训这些人的问题，当然，借助我们拥有的计算机化程度很高的系统，他们可以通过合理数量的培训来适应。所以，我的意思是，我们'事实上，几天前纳帕谷的大雨似乎比罢工更让业主们烦恼。Mondaby 每年生产约 100 万箱，属于 Charles Krug 品牌的超优质品牌，中档优质葡萄酒和罐装葡萄酒。蒙达比表示，由于从欧洲进口廉价葡萄酒，该行业在过去几年中遭受重创。尽管如今美国人主要以酒柜形式饮用更多的葡萄酒，但酿酒商表示，利润并不多“我觉得这个行业已经跌入低谷，现在正处于上升趋势。”当然，这不是一夜之间就能看到的上升趋势，但现在是一个逐步增长的健康上升趋势。但我不一定会说更高的盈利能力，因为利润非常非常微薄。确实，销量是有的，但利润却非常非常微薄。蒙达比的边际利润论点并没有赢得罢工工人的太多支持，比如在基督教兄弟装瓶厂工作的汉娜·斯托克顿(Hannah Stockton)。 “我不相信，因为我每天读报纸，听新闻。我的意思是，销售额有所增加。我的意思是，……我相信三四年前，我们有一个“行业不景气。但葡萄酒正在卷土重来。现在他们推出了酒柜；他们正在赚钱。我们不想加薪；我们只想保留我们现有的东西。”酿酒业工人的工资从每小时八美元到十五美元不等。 工会愿意放弃工资的小幅削减，但拒绝接受养老金和医疗福利的削减。据报道，雇主希望工资和福利待遇减少百分之二十。酒厂老板表示，工会必须认识到总体成本已经增加。 “不仅毛利率下降了，竞争还迫使我们增加营销和广告，这进一步侵蚀了原本的利润。” David Spualding 是卡利斯托加一家酒庄的总经理。与查尔斯·克鲁格（Charles Krug）和加洛（Gallo）相比，斯波尔丁葡萄园规模很小，而且斯波尔丁葡萄园没有罢工，但大卫·斯波尔丁（David Spaulding）表示，他面临着与大公司相同的市场力量。 “我认为最大的问题与全国农业面临的问题相同；那就是过剩。你知道我们的产量越来越多，生产效率也越来越高，而且我们的产量超过了市场需求。”斯波尔丁表示，酒柜已经解决了部分过剩生产，但不是全部。至于工会领导人，他们认为当产品需求增加时返还工资和福利不是好主意。酿酒厂工人本周一直在就管理层提议的工资和福利削减进行投票。杰里·戴维斯是工会的一名官员。 “根据我今天交谈过的人以及谈判委员会的说法，我们要求对这项提案投反对票。”结果预计将于周四公布。我是威廉·德拉蒙德，为国家公共广播电台报道。
