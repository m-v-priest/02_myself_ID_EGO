Lesson18


Much of the flood-plagued Midwest got more rain today.  +

Flood waters have forced more than 2,000 families out of their homes.  +

Illinois has suffered heavily with 4 deaths and $ 30,000 damage blamed on flooding.  +

There are also reports that one man was killed today in Oklahoma when his car was swept off a bridge.  +

A partially-ruptured dam was in Wisconsin and remains standing but leaking, and officials are fearful more rain could cause it to burst.  +

A French television cameramen reported kidnapped in Lebanon on Sunday has been freed according to the French Foreign Ministry.  +

A spokesman says Jean Marc Srucie
was released today in the southern suburbs of Beirut and has returned to the Christian east sector of the city.  +

No group claimed responsibility for his kidnapping and the Foreign Ministry did not provide any details about his captivity or his return.  +

President Reagan paid tribute today to former president Jimmy Carter during dedication ceremonies for Mr.  +

Carter's presidential library near Atlanta.  +

President Reagan, who soundly defeated Carter in the 1980 election, said there was no need to downplay differences between the two men: "Our very differences attest to the greatness of our nation, for I can think of no other country on earth where two political leaders could disagree so widely, yet come together in mutual respect." Mr.  +

Reagan went on to say former President Carter graced the White House with his passion, intellect and commitment.  +

The library was dedicated on Mr.  +

Carter's sixty-second birthday.  +

And President Reagan advised his predecessor that life begins at seventy.  +

There was more rain in the Midwest today, where several states are facing rising flood waters.  +

Thousands of people in Illinois and Wisconsin have been forced from their homes.  +

And in Oklahoma, the State National Guard was called upon to rescue stranded homeowners who had been cut off and trapped.  +

In northeastern Illinois, the floods follow 5 straight days of heavy rain.  +

Cheryl Coralie of member station, WBEZ, reports that the governor of Illinois was on the scene with a promise for the people: "They're coming.  +

They're coming.  +

They're on the way." During his tour of the damaged areas, Illinois governor, James Thompson, tried to buoy the spirits of weary residents, alerting them that much coveted sandbags were on the way.  +

Three northern and western counties near Chicago, hard hit by storms, have seen the burgeoning Foy and Desplaines Rivers spill into their streets, their garages and, ultimately, their homes.  +

Residents and authorities had been pinning their hopes on sandbagging.  +

Public works trucks line up to load sand onto their flatbeds.  +

The US Army Corps of Engineers with state officials today are distributing a quarter million of the bags to communities stricken or threatened by ever expanding flood waters.  +

But for some residents, even the sandbags have failed.  +

"The water, from flowing this way, went through and by the pressure finally knocked the sandbags over.  +

And, within a matter of a minute, every wall came down, and I was standing in water this deep." State emergency officials say the state could suffer $ 30,000,000 in damages and what is one of Illinois' worst flooding disasters.  +

Most residents have been trying to tough it out, but rescue worker, Dave Besh, says that's changing: "I know there's people calling up now that refused evacuation yesterday, that are calling here now, getting hold of our trucks verbally because their phones are out, that want to be evacuated now and they're trying to get the boats to get them out of
there." The floods have driven more than 2,000 people from their homes.  +

They have also forced road closures and businesses and schools to shut down.  +

In Gurney, Illinois, the elementary school classrooms sit under 5 feet of water and Gurney Deputy Fire Chief, Tim McGrath, says there's little that can be done.  +

"We know we're going to displace.  +

We know that we're going to sustain more loss.  +

There's no way of confining the river, of course, there's no controlling the river." Today, Governor Thompson declared a number of additional community state disaster areas, setting up the first step for Federal help.  +

The rainy weather forecast is not of much comfort, and some weary workers and homeowners say the only thing left to do now is wait until the flooding passes and put everything back together again.  +

Fast food restaurants have made some Americans rich.  +

It's been more than 30 years since the first McDonald's opened, and this nation's eating habits have been transformed by fast food.  +

Today, we spend over $50,000,000,000 a year on Whopper's Big Macs and the Colonel's Fried Chicken.  +

The key is convenience.  +

The ignored factor is nutrition.  +

That's something Michael Jacobson cares about.  +

He's written a Fast Food Guide to tell consumers what's under the bun.  +

As far as hamburgers go, Jacobson says one chain's burger is as good nutritional as the next.  +

"Each chain has a variety of hamburgers: singles, doubles, triples; in some restaurants, cheeseburger, baconburger, mushroom burgers, and generally, when they start gussying up the hamburger with the toppings, you're going to get more fat, more salt, and less nutritious product." "So you think you shouldn't be so concerned with which chain it is you're eating at as far as the burger, but rather whether you're getting the simple, naked burger, or the burger with all the fillings on it.  +

That's where a lot of the fat comes in." "For instance, at Wendy's, you can just get a regular little hamburger, which has about 4 teaspoons of fat, or you can get then triple cheeseburger with 15 teaspoons of fat, and that's a tremendous difference.  +

I think the message for hamburgers and many other fast foods is to keep it simple, keep it small." "Is the meat that's used in most of these chains fattier than what I'd buy if I went to the butcher and bought meat?" "We actually had these meats analyzed, and we found they were pretty average.  +

It was an ordinary grade hamburger meat for most of the chains.  +

You can get much leaner meat at the grocery store, or if you get ground round.  +

If you want red meat and you want to eat at a fast food restaurant, I recommend going for the roast beef.  +

All roast beef was leaner than all hamburger meat in the tests we conducted." "Now this does differ from chain to chain because, for instance, the Roy Roger's roast beef, you have listed as having 2% fat whereas Arby's roast beef, 13%." "The differences in roast beef are really remarkable.  +

Arby's and Hardy's have 7 times as much fat as Roy Roger's.  +

Also, Roy Roger's had real roast beef, whereas Arby's has
kind of a composite roast beef, where the beef is chipped and scrunched together with sodium phosphate and other chemicals." "It is impossible now to watch TV without seeing commercials for chicken nuggets from one chain or another.  +

What are chicken nuggets made out of?" "Chicken McNuggets at McDonald's, probably the original chicken nuggets, are not whole pieces of chicken.  +

Rather it's composite chicken made with ground-up chicken skin held together with sodium phosphate and salt.  +

It's a relatively fatty product, about 5 teaspoons of fat for a small order of McNuggets.  +

The competition at, say, Burger King, which makes chicken tenders, uses real chicken.  +

And the fat content, partly because it doesn't have ground up chicken skin in it, is much lower, about 2 teaspoons for a small order of chicken tenders." "Chicken is a food that is highly recommended by people who are very calorie conscious and are very fat conscious, because it's a food low in fat.  +

But once you get the chicken and you deep fry it, as they do at all the fast food chains, is it still a nutritionally good food?" "Well, chicken products tend to have less fat than beef products partly because the fat stays on the outside.  +

If you're getting fried chicken, you ought to take off the skin, take off the breading.  +

That's where most of the fat, most of the sodium are.  +

So you can turn kind of a mediocre product into really quite a nutritious product." "If the fast food industry came to you for advice about how they could nutritionally improve their menus, what would you tell them?" "Fresh fruit, low-fat diary products, low-fat or skim milk, keep up those salad bars, baked fish, baked chicken, and that lean roast beef.  +

It is possible to offer nutritious tasty foods at a fast food restaurant, and I hope that the chains are moving in the right direction with the proliferation of salad, salad bars, and the like." In Washington, Michael Jacobson, Director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.



受洪水困扰的中西部大部分地区今天降雨较多。洪水迫使2000多个家庭逃离家园。伊利诺伊州因洪水遭受重创，造成 4 人死亡，损失达 30,000 美元。还有报道称，今天在俄克拉荷马州，一名男子因汽车被冲下桥而丧生。威斯康星州一座部分破裂的大坝仍然矗立，但正在泄漏，官员们担心更多的降雨可能会导致大坝决堤。据法国外交部称，周日在黎巴嫩被绑架的一名法国电视摄影师已被释放。一位发言人表示，吉恩·马克·斯鲁西今天在贝鲁特南郊获释，并已返回该市的基督教东区。没有任何组织声称对他的绑架负责，外交部也没有提供有关他被囚禁或返回的任何细节。今天，里根总统在亚特兰大附近的卡特总统图书馆落成仪式上向前总统吉米·卡特致敬。在 1980 年大选中彻底击败卡特的里根总统表示，没有必要淡化两人之间的差异：“我们之间的差异本身就证明了我们国家的伟大，因为我想不出世界上还有哪个国家可以同时拥有两个政治国家。”领导人可以有如此广泛的分歧，但却可以相互尊重地走到一起。”里根先生接着表示，前总统卡特以他的热情、智慧和奉献精神为白宫增光添彩。该图书馆是在卡特先生六十二岁生日之际举行的落成典礼。里根总统告诉他的前任，生命从七十岁开始。今天中西部地区降雨较多，部分州面临洪水上涨的威胁。伊利诺伊州和威斯康星州的数千人被迫离开家园。 在俄克拉荷马州，州国民警卫队被要求营救被困的受困房主。在伊利诺伊州东北部，连续五天的大雨引发了洪水。 WBEZ 会员站的谢丽尔·科拉莉 (Cheryl Coralie) 报道说，伊利诺伊州州长在现场向人民做出承诺：“他们来了。他们来了。他们正在路上。”伊利诺伊州州长詹姆斯·汤普森在视察受损地区期间，试图振奋疲惫居民的精神，提醒他们，令人垂涎的沙袋即将到来。芝加哥附近的三个北部和西部县遭受暴风雨的严重袭击，汹涌的福伊河和德斯普兰河涌入了他们的街道、车库，并最终侵入了他们的家园。居民和当局一直把希望寄托在沙袋上。公共工程卡车排队将沙子装载到平板上。今天，美国陆军工程兵团和州政府官员正在向遭受不断扩大的洪水袭击或威胁的社区分发 25 万个袋子。但对于一些居民来说，连沙袋都失效了。 “水从这里流过，最后在压力的作用下把沙袋撞倒了。不到一分钟的时间，每一堵墙都倒塌了，我站在这么深的水里。”州紧急事务官员表示，该州可能遭受 3000 万美元的损失，这是伊利诺伊州最严重的洪水灾害之一。大多数居民一直在努力渡过难关，但救援人员戴夫·贝什 (Dave Besh) 表示，这种情况正在发生变化：“我知道有些人昨天拒绝疏散，现在打电话来，口头要求我们的卡车，因为他们的电话没电。那些想要撤离的人现在正试图让船只将他们带离那里。” 洪水已导致 2,000 多人逃离家园。洪水还迫使道路封闭，企业和学校关闭。在伊利诺伊州格尼，小学教室位于 5 英尺深的水下，格尼副消防队长蒂姆·麦格拉思 (Tim McGrath) ，说几乎无能为力。“我们知道我们会被取代。我们知道我们将承受更多的损失。没有办法限制河流，当然，也无法控制河流。”今天，汤普森州长宣布了一些额外的社区州灾区，为联邦援助迈出了第一步。阴雨天气的天气预报并没有带来多少安慰。 ，一些疲惫的工人和房主说，现在唯一要做的就是等到洪水过去，然后把一切重新组装起来。我是国家公共广播电台的芝加哥谢丽尔·科拉莉。快餐店让一些美国人变得富有。第一家麦当劳开业已经30多年了，快餐改变了这个国家的饮食习惯。今天，我们每年在皇堡巨无霸和上校炸鸡上的花费超过500亿美元。关键是方便。被忽视的因素是营养。这是迈克尔·雅各布森关心的事情。他写了一本快餐指南，告诉消费者面包里面有什么。就汉堡包而言，雅各布森说，一家连锁店的汉堡和下一家的汉堡一样有营养。 “每家连锁店都有各种各样的汉堡包：单人汉堡、双人汉堡、三人汉堡；在一些餐馆，有芝士汉堡、培根汉堡、蘑菇汉堡，一般来说，当他们开始用配料装饰汉堡时，你会变得更多脂肪，更多盐，以及营养价值较低的产品。” “所以你认为你不应该那么关心你在哪家连锁店吃汉堡，而应该关心你吃的是简单的裸汉堡还是带有所有馅料的汉堡。这就是大量脂肪的来源。”“例如，在 Wendy’s，你可以买一个普通的小汉堡，其中含有大约 4 茶匙的脂肪，或者你可以买一个含有 15 茶匙脂肪的三重芝士汉堡，那就是巨大的差异。我认为汉堡包和许多其他快餐的信息是保持简单，保持小。”“大多数连锁店使用的肉比我去肉店买的肉更肥吗？ ” “我们实际上对这些肉类进行了分析，发现它们的质量相当一般。对于大多数连锁店来说，这是普通等级的汉堡肉。你可以在杂货店或者磨碎的肉店买到更瘦的肉。如果您想要红肉并且想在快餐店吃东西，我建议您去吃烤牛肉。在我们进行的测试中，所有烤牛肉都比所有汉堡包肉瘦。” “现在，这确实因连锁店而异，因为例如，Roy Roger's 烤牛肉，您列出的脂肪含量为 2%，而 Arby's 烤牛肉，脂肪含量为 13% %。” “烤牛肉的差异确实很显着。阿比和哈迪的脂肪含量是罗伊·罗杰的 7 倍。此外，罗伊·罗杰 (Roy Roger) 餐厅有真正的烤牛肉，而阿比 (Arby’s) 则有一种复合烤牛肉，牛肉是用磷酸钠和其他化学物质切碎并揉碎的。”“现在看电视不可能不看到鸡块的广告。一条链或另一条链。鸡块是用什么做的？” “麦当劳的麦乐鸡，可能是最原始的鸡块，并不是整块鸡肉。 相反，它是用磨碎的鸡皮与磷酸钠和盐粘合在一起制成的复合鸡肉。这是一种脂肪含量相对较高的产品，一小份麦乐鸡大约需要 5 茶匙脂肪。例如，生产鸡柳的汉堡王的竞争使用的是真正的鸡肉。而且脂肪含量也低很多，部分是因为里面没有磨碎的鸡皮，一小份鸡柳大约需要两茶匙。” “鸡肉是高热量人群强烈推荐的食物。有意识并且非常注重脂肪，因为它是低脂肪食物。但是，一旦你拿到鸡肉，然后将其油炸，就像所有快餐连锁店所做的那样，它仍然是一种营养良好的食物吗？”“嗯，鸡肉产品往往比牛肉产品含有更少的脂肪，部分原因是脂肪留在上面外。如果你要吃炸鸡，你应该把皮去掉，去掉面包屑。那是大部分脂肪、大部分钠所在的地方。这样你就可以把一种平庸的产品变成一种真正营养丰富的产品。”“如果快餐行业向你寻求如何在营养上改进菜单的建议，你会告诉他们什么？”“新鲜水果，低-脂肪乳制品、低脂或脱脂牛奶，保留那些沙拉吧、烤鱼、烤鸡肉和瘦烤牛肉。在快餐店提供营养美味的食物是可能的，我希望随着沙拉、沙拉吧等的普及，连锁店能朝着正确的方向发展。”在华盛顿，中心主任迈克尔·雅各布森 (Michael Jacobson)为了公共利益的科学。
