The Senate has voted to override President Reagan's veto of sanctions against South Africa by a decisive seventy-eight to twenty-one.  +

As the House has already voted to override, the sanctions now become law.  +

NPR's Linda Wertheimer reports.  +

"American civil rights leaders, including Mrs.  +

Caretta Scott King, watched the Senate debate from the Senate family gallery as members argued not so much about sanctions and the efficacy of sanctions, more about the choice between affirming the bill already passed by congress or supporting the President." American food aid to southern African countries could be cut off if South Africa carries out its threat to ban imports of US grain.  +

Foreign Minister Pic Botha said if US sanctions were imposed, his government would stop imports and would not allow its transport service to carry US grain to neighboring countries.  +

The White House today denied that it planted misleading stories in the American news media as part of a plan to topple Libyan leader Muammar Quddafi.  +

The Washington Post reported this morning that stories were leaked this summer alleging
Quddafi was resuming his support for terrorist activities, even though National Security Adviser John Poindexter knew otherwise.  +

Today, White House spokesman Larry Speakes said Poindexter denied the administration had involved the media in an anti-Quddafi campaign but Speakes left open the possibility a disinformation campaign was conducted in other countries.  +

The question in Washington today is this: Did the federal government try to scare Libya's Colonel Muammar Quddafi in August by way of a disinformation campaign in the American media? The Washington Post Bob Woodward reports today that there was an elaborate disinformation program set up by the White House to convince Quddafi that the United States was about to attack again, or that he might be ousted in a coup.  +

The White House today denies that officials tried to mislead Quddafi by using the American media.  +

NPR's Bill Busenburg has our first report on the controversy.  +

The story starts on August 25th when the Wall Street Journal ran a front page story saying that Libya and the United States were once again on a collision course.  +

Quoting multiple official sources, the paper said Quddafi was plotting new terrorist attacks and the Reagan Administration was preparing to teach him another lesson.  +

The Journal reported that the Pentagon was completing plans for a new and wider bombing of Libya in case the President ordered it.  +

That story caused a flurry of press attention.  +

Officials in Washington and at the western White House in California were asked if it was true.  +

"The story was authoritative," said the White House spokesman Larry Speakes.  +

Based on that official confirmation, other news organizations, including the New York Times , the Washington Post , NPR and the major TV networks, all ran stories suggesting Libya should watch out.  +

US naval maneuvers then taking place in the Mediterranean might be used as a cover for more attacks on Libya as in the past.  +

Today's Washington Post , however, quotes from an August 14th secret White House plan, adopted eleven days before the Wall Street Journal story.  +

It was outlined in a memo written by the President's National Security Advisor John Poindexter.  +

That plan called for a strategy of real and illusory events, using a disinformation program to make Quddafi think the United States was about to move against him militarily.  +

Here are some examples the Post cites, suggesting disinformation was used domestically: Number one, while some US officials told the press Quddafi was stepping up his terrorist plans, President Reagan was being told in a memo that Quddafi was temporarily quiescent, in other words, that he wasn't active.  +

Number two, while some officials were telling the press of internal infighting in Libya to oust Quddafi, US officials really believed he was firmly in power and that CIA's efforts to oust him were not working.  +

Number three, while officials were telling the press the Pentagon was planning new attacks, in fact nothing new was being done.  +

Existing contingency plans were several months old, and the naval maneuvers were just maneuvers.  +

The Post says this policy of deception was approved at a National Security Planning Group meeting chaired by President Reagan and his top aides.
Two new studies were published today on the links between television coverage of suicide and subsequent teenage suicide rates.  +

The New England Journal of Medicine reports that both studies suggest that some teenagers might be more likely to take their own lives after seeing TV programs dealing with suicide.  +

NPR's Lorie Garrett reports.  +

The first suicide study, done by a team from the University of California in San Diego, examines television news coverage of suicides.  +

David Philips and Lundy Carseson looked at forty-five suicide stories carried on network news-casts between 1973 and '79.  +

The researchers then compared the incidence of teen suicides in those years to the dates of broadcast of these stories.  +

David Philips says news coverage of suicides definitely prompted an increase in the number of teens in America who took their lives.  +

"The more TV programs that carry a story, the greater they increase in teen suicides just afterwards." The suicide increase among teens was compared by Philips to adult suicide trends.  +

"The teen suicides go up by about 2.91 teen suicides per story.  +

And adult suicides go up by, I think, around two adult suicides per story.  +

The increase for teens, the percentage increase for teens is very, very much larger than the percentage increase for adults.  +

It's about, I think, fourteen or fifteen times as big a response for teens percentagewise as it is for adults." The TV news coverage appears to have prompted a greater increase than is seen around other well-known periods of adolescent depression, such as holidays, personal birthdays, the start of school and winter.  +

Philips could not find any specific types of stories that seem to trigger a greater response among depressed teens.  +

Philips says it seems to simply be the word "suicide" and the knowledge that somebody actively executed the act that pushes buttons in depressed teenagers.  +

Psychiatrists call this "imitative behavior." "What my study showed was that there seems to be imitation not only of relatively bland behavior like dress, dressing or hairstyles, but there seems to be imitation of really quite deviant behavior as well.  +

The teenagers imitate apparently across the board, not just suicides, but everything else as well." In a separate study, Madeline Gould and David Shaeffer of Columbia University found that made-for-television movies about suicide also stimulated imitative behavior.  +

Even though the movies were intended to portray the problem of teen suicide and offered, in some cases, suicide hot line numbers and advice on counselling, the team believes the four network movies prompted eighty teen suicides.  +

One of the made-for-TV movies examined by the Columbia University team was a CBS production.  +

George Schweitzer, a CBS's Vice President, is well aware of this research.  +

He says, "It is terribly unfortunate that any teens took their lives after the broadcast, but if they had it to do over," says Schweitzer, "CBS would still run the movie." "Studies like these do not measure the most, what we think is the most important thing, which I don't think can be measured, and that is the hundreds and hundreds
and probably thousands of teenagers who were positively moved by these kinds of broadcasts." Moved to call suicide hot lines, moved to seek counseling, and moved to discuss their depressions with family members.  +

Schweitzer does not dispute today's studies: some teens may moved to suicide.  +

"But ignoring the issue for fear of that, I think, would be far more disastrous than addressing important social issues to help create awareness and again to have a positive effect." But researcher David Philips suggests the media could decrease the teen suicide problem by avoiding some suicide stories all together and changing the way the others are covered.  +

For example, says Philips, "Don't make suicide seem heroic." He cites the story of a young Czechoslovakian dissident who set himself on fire.  +

But the dissident action was taken to draw attention to government repression in Czechoslovakia.  +

Should the news media really have ignored such a story? "I think it's a really difficult question.  +

There are all these goods on all sides of the issue.  +

And thank God, I don't have to be the one to disentangle that issue." One prominent expert in this field said the young people moved to take their lives, following a news story or movie, are particularly vulnerable, suicidal individuals.  +

In the absence of television stories, some other events in their lives might well have triggered their actions.  +

So while most psychiatrists agree there is an imitative component to teenage suicides, that tendency, they say, should not lead society to repress information.  +

On the contrary, some say we are now facing a major epidemic of adolescent suicide in America.  +

We must publicize and confront the problem.  +

Last year some fifty-five hundred adolescents between fifteen and twenty-four years of age took their lives.  +

At least ten times that tried.  +

Some estimates are that 275 thousand teens attempted suicide last year.  +

The rate of teenage suicide in America has tripled since 1955.



参议院以 78 比 21 的决定性投票结果推翻了里根总统对南非制裁的否决。由于众议院已经投票推翻，制裁现已成为法律。 NPR 的琳达·韦特海默报道。 “包括卡雷塔·斯科特·金夫人在内的美国民权领袖在参议院家庭旁听席上观看了参议院的辩论，议员们的争论与其说是关于制裁和制裁的效力，不如说是关于在肯定国会已经通过的法案还是支持之间做出选择。总统。”如果南非兑现其禁止进口美国谷物的威胁，美国对南部非洲国家的粮食援助可能会被切断。外交部长皮克·博塔表示，如果美国实施制裁，他的政府将停止进口，并不允许其运输服务将美国粮食运往邻国。白宫今天否认在美国新闻媒体上植入误导性报道，作为推翻利比亚领导人穆阿迈尔·库扎菲计划的一部分。 《华盛顿邮报》今天早上报道称，今年夏天有报道称库达菲重新支持恐怖活动，尽管国家安全顾问约翰·波因德克斯特并不知情。今天，白宫发言人拉里·斯皮克斯表示，波因德克斯特否认政府让媒体参与了反库扎菲运动，但斯皮克斯保留了在其他国家开展虚假信息运动的可能性。今天华盛顿的问题是：联邦政府是否试图在八月份通过美国媒体的虚假信息宣传来恐吓利比亚的穆阿迈尔·库达菲上校？ 《华盛顿邮报》鲍勃·伍德沃德今天报道称，白宫制定了一个精心设计的虚假信息计划，目的是让库扎菲相信美国即将再次发动袭击，或者他可能会在政变中被赶下台。白宫今天否认官员试图利用美国媒体误导库达菲。美国国家公共广播电台 (NPR) 的比尔·布森伯格 (Bill Busenburg) 为我们带来了关于这一争议的第一份报道。故事要从8月25日《华尔街日报》的头版报道说起，利比亚和美国再次陷入冲突。该报援引多个官方消息称，库达菲正在策划新的恐怖袭击，里根政府正准备再给他一个教训。据《华尔街日报》报道，五角大楼正在完成对利比亚进行新的、更广泛的轰炸的计划，以防总统下令。这个故事引起了媒体的广泛关注。华盛顿和加州西部白宫的官员被问及这是否属实。 “这个故事具有权威性，”白宫发言人拉里·斯皮克斯说。根据这一官方确认，其他新闻机构，包括《纽约时报》、《华盛顿邮报》、NPR 和主要电视网络，都发表了建议利比亚应该警惕的报道。美国当时在地中海进行的海军演习可能会像过去一样，成为对利比亚发动更多袭击的掩护。然而，今天的《华盛顿邮报》引用了 8 月 14 日白宫秘密计划的内容，该计划是在《华尔街日报》报道前 11 天通过的。总统国家安全顾问约翰·波因德克斯特撰写的一份备忘录对此进行了概述。 该计划要求采取真实和虚幻事件的策略，利用虚假信息计划让库扎菲认为美国即将对他采取军事行动。以下是《华盛顿邮报》引用的一些例子，表明国内使用了虚假信息：第一，当一些美国官员告诉媒体库扎菲正在加强他的恐怖计划时，里根总统在一份备忘录中被告知库扎菲暂时处于静止状态，换句话说，他不活跃。第二，虽然一些官员向媒体讲述利比亚的内讧，以推翻库扎菲，但美国官员确实相信他牢牢掌握权力，中央情报局驱逐他的努力没有奏效。第三，虽然官员们告诉媒体五角大楼正在计划新的袭击，但事实上并没有采取任何新的行动。现有的应急计划已经制定了几个月，海军演习也只是演习。 《华盛顿邮报》称，这一欺骗政策是在里根总统及其高级助手主持的国家安全规划小组会议上批准的。今天发表了两项关于电视自杀报道与随后的青少年自杀率之间联系的新研究。 《新英格兰医学杂志》报道称，这两项研究都表明，一些青少年在观看有关自杀的电视节目后可能更有可能自杀。 NPR 的洛里·加勒特报道。第一项自杀研究由圣地亚哥加利福尼亚大学的一个团队进行，调查了电视新闻对自杀的报道。大卫·菲利普斯 (David Philips) 和伦迪·卡森 (Lundy Carseson) 研究了 1973 年至 79 年间网络新闻广播中报道的 45 个自杀故事。研究人员随后将这些年青少年自杀的发生率与这些故事的播出日期进行了比较。 大卫·菲利普斯表示，有关自杀的新闻报道无疑导致了美国自杀青少年人数的增加。 “报道故事的电视节目越多，随后青少年自杀的人数就越多。”飞利浦将青少年自杀率的上升趋势与成人自杀趋势进行了比较。 “每个故事的青少年自杀人数增加了约 2.91 人。我认为，每个故事的成人自杀人数增加了大约 2 人。青少年的增加，青少年的百分比增加比百分比要大得多。成年人的比例有所增加。我认为，青少年的反应比例大约是成年人的十四或十五倍。”电视新闻报道似乎比其他众所周知的青少年抑郁时期（例如假期、个人生日、开学和冬季）导致的青少年抑郁症增加幅度更大。飞利浦找不到任何特定类型的故事似乎能在抑郁的青少年中引发更大的反应。飞利浦表示，这似乎只是“自杀”这个词，以及知道有人主动执行了对抑郁青少年进行按钮的行为。精神病学家称之为“模仿行为”。 “我的研究表明，人们似乎不仅模仿衣着、打扮或发型等相对平淡的行为，而且似乎也模仿非常不正常的行为。青少年显然是全面模仿，而不仅仅是自杀。” ，但其他一切也是如此。”在另一项研究中，哥伦比亚大学的马德琳·古尔德和大卫·谢弗发现，有关自杀的电视电影也会刺激模仿行为。 尽管这些电影的目的是描绘青少年自杀问题，并在某些情况下提供自杀热线电话号码和咨询建议，但研究小组认为，这四部网络电影导致了 80 起青少年自杀事件。哥伦比亚大学团队检查的其中一部电视电影是哥伦比亚广播公司制作的。哥伦比亚广播公司副总裁乔治·施韦策 (George Schweitzer) 非常了解这项研究。他说，“非常不幸的是，任何青少年在播出后自杀，但如果他们能重来一次，”施韦策说，“哥伦比亚广播公司仍然会播放这部电影。” “像这样的研究并没有衡量最多的，我们认为最重要的事情，我认为无法衡量，那就是成百上千甚至可能成千上万的青少年被此类广播所积极感动”。拨打自杀热线，寻求咨询，并与家人讨论他们的抑郁症。施韦策对当今的研究没有异议：一些青少年可能会走向自杀。 “但我认为，因为担心这个问题而忽视这个问题，比解决重要的社会问题以帮助提高认识并再次产生积极影响更具灾难性。”但研究人员大卫·菲利普斯认为，媒体可以通过避免某些自杀故事并改变报道其他故事的方式来减少青少年自杀问题。例如，飞利浦说，“不要让自杀看起来很英雄。”他引用了一位年轻的捷克斯洛伐克持不同政见者自焚的故事。但持不同政见者采取的行动是为了引起人们对捷克斯洛伐克政府镇压的关注。新闻媒体真的应该忽视这样的故事吗？ “我认为这是一个非常困难的问题。问题的各个方面都有所有这些商品。 感谢上帝，我不必成为解决这个问题的人。”该领域的一位著名专家表示，这些年轻人在看到新闻报道或电影后自杀，是特别脆弱、有自杀倾向的人。由于没有电视故事，他们生活中的其他一些事件很可能引发了他们的行为。因此，尽管大多数精神病学家都认为青少年自杀存在模仿成分，但他们表示，这种倾向不应导致社会压制信息。相反，有人说我们现在在美国面临着青少年自杀的严重流行。我们必须宣传并正视这个问题。去年，大约有 5500 名 15 至 24 岁的青少年自杀了。至少是这个数字的十倍。据估计，去年有 27.5 万名青少年试图自杀。自 1955 年以来，美国青少年自杀率增加了两倍。
