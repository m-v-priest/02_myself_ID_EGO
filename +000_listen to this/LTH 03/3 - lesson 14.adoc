Lesson14


State Department spokesman Bernard Kalb resigned today because of the Reagan Administration's alleged disinformation campaign against Libya.  +

The Washington Post reported last week that the administration planted false information about Libya in an effort to destabilize the government of Muammar Quddafi.  +

Kalb today did not confirm or deny that such a campaign took place, but he said reports about it had damaged the credibility of the US.  +

The State Department would not comment on Kalb's resignation.  +

The State Department today criticized the Nicarguan government for allegedly
refusing to grant US officials access to Eugene Hasenfus.  +

He's the survivor of Sunday's plane crash inside Nicaragua.  +

State Department spokesman Charles Redmond.  +

"Our representative was not received by the Nicaraguan government.  +

And we view this with the utmost seriousness.  +

The rendering of consular services is an essential part of the function of an embassy.  +

The Sandinista government has once again taken action to make that function difficult and has raised the question of whether, indeed, a US embassy can function normally within Nicaragua.  +

We frankly cannot accept the delay in granting consular access since the Sandinista government has apparently gone to some lengths to parade Mr.  +

Hasenfus before the press, and considering the fact that a government spokesman stated clearly last night on American television that access would be granted." Meanwhile President Reagan today denied that the downed plane allegedly carrying arms to Contra rebels was operating under official US orders.  +

He also acknowledged that the government has been aware that private American groups and citizens have been helping the anti-government forces in Nicaragua.  +

Last week the Washington Post reported that top-level officials had approved a plan to generate real and illusionary events to make Libya's Colonel Muammar Quddafi think the United States might once again attack.  +

Bernard Kalb's resignation is the first in protest of that policy.  +

A similar resignation occurred at the White House in 1983 when a deputy quit to protest misleading statements given to the press shortly before the American invasion of Grenada.  +

NPR's Bill Busenberg has more on today's announcement.  +

Bernard Kalb had been a veteran diplomatic correspondent for CBS and NBC before being picked two years ago by Secretary of State George Shultz to be the Department's chief spokesman, officially an Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs.  +

His brother, Marvin Kalb, is still with NBC.  +

Today, Bernard Kalb surprised his former colleagues in the news media by quitting over the issue of the administration's disinformaton program.  +

Kalb would not confirm that there was such a program, but he said he faced a choice of remaining silent or registering his dissent.  +

And even though the issue appeared to be fading from the news, Kalb grappled with it privately and decided he had to act.  +

"The controversy may vanish, but when you are sitting alone, it does not go away.  +

And so I've taken the step of stepping down." The State Department has reportedly been involved in the disinformation issue, but Kalb said his guidelines have always been not to lie or mislead the press, and he has not done so.  +

Kalb went out of his way today to praise Secretary Shultz, a man, he said, of such overwhelming integrity that he allows other people to have their own integrity.  +

"In taking this action, I want to emphasize that I am not dissenting from Secretary Shultz, a man of credibility, rather I am dissenting from the reported disinformation program." Kalb's comments suggested Shultz perhaps did not go along with the disinformation program, but in public, the Secretary of State has defended the administration's
policies against Libya, saying in New York last week: "I don't have any problems with the little psychological warfare against Quddafi." He also quoted Winstion Churchill as saying, "In time of war truth is so precious, it must be attended by a bodyguard of lies." Shultz was asked about the disinformation effort last Sunday on ABC.  +

"I don't lie.  +

I've never taken part in any meeting in which it was proposed that we go out and lie to the news media for some effect.  +

And if somebody did that, he was doing it against policy.  +

Now having said that, one of the results of our action against Libya, from all the intelligence we've received, was quite a period of disorientation on the part of Quddafi.  +

So, to the extent we can keep Quddafi off balance by one means or another, including the possibility that we might make another attack, I think that's good." In a sometimes emotional session with reporters today, Bernard Kalb said that neither he personally nor the nation as a whole can stand any policy of disinformation.  +

"I'm concerned about the impact of any such program on the credibility of the United States.  +

Faith, faith in the word of America, is the pulse beat of our democracy.  +

Anything that hurts America's credibility hurts America.  +

And then on a much, much, much lower level, there's question of my own credibility, both as a spokesman and a journalist, a spokesman for a couple of years, a journalist for more years than I want to remember.  +

In fact, I sometimes privately thought of myself as a journalist masquerading as a spokesman.  +

In any case, I do not want my own credibility to be caught up, to be subsumed in this controversy." The timing of Kalb's action today is likely to add to the controversy over government deception.  +

And it comes at an awkward moment for the Reagan Administration, just days before an important pre-summit meeting with the Soviets in Iceland and in the wake of official denials about a downed guerrilla resupply plane in Nicaragua.  +

One American was captured and others were killed in that action, but officials have said the flight was in no way connected with the US government.  +

Kalb said his resignation today had nothing to do with any other incident.  +

I'm Bill Busenberg in Washington.  +

The history of Jews in Poland is not always thoroughly told in the country.  +

And the story of the World War II freedom fighters in the Jewish ghetto of Warsaw is one of the saddest chapters.  +

The Nazis took hundreds of thousands of Jews to their deaths, and seven thousand more died defending the area when the Germans invaded.  +

Dr.  +

Merrick Adelman is one of the very few who survived.  +

A book called Shielding the Flame is his story.  +

It was written in Poland ten years age by Hannah Kroll.  +

It is now available in this country in English.  +

Yohannes Toshimska is one of the translators.  +

She says that Merrick Adelman's view of the ghetto uprising is regarded as unconventional.  +

"He doesn't use the language or even he doesn't have the attitude people usually have to the holocaust and to the ghetto uprisings.  +

One thing he's consistently talking about is the fact that people thought was the arms in the ghetto.  +

It wasn't heroic; it was easier than to die going to the train cars.  +

And that people who participated in
the ghetto uprising were actually, in a sense, lucky.  +

They had arms; they could do something about what was going on while those hundreds of thousands who were led to the train cars were equally heroic, but their death was much more difficult." "Dr.  +

Adelman was stationed ...  +

he was working in a clinic; he was not a doctor then; but he was working in a clinic that was nearby the train station where the Jews were taken to go off to the concentration camps." "Yes.  +

He had an amazing position.  +

He was standing at the gate to the Hmflat Platz, which was the place from where the Jews were taken into the train cars.  +

He was a member of the underground in the ghetto, and he was choosing the people who were needed by the underground.  +

They were perhaps one or two in many thousands of them led every day to the cars.  +

And he would pick these people up, and then young girls who were students at the nurses' school would disabilitate these people.  +

He describes in the book, it's a very powerful scene, how these girls, who were wearing beautiful clean white uniforms of nurse students, would take two pieces of wood and with these two pieces of wood would break legs of the people who were supposed to be saved for the Jewish underground.  +

But the Germans, to the last moment, wanted to maintain the fiction that people who were taken to the trains were being taken for work.  +

And obviously a person with a broken leg couldn't work.  +

So breaking a leg would temporarily save that person from being taken into gas." "So he saw in all, I believe he says four hundred thousand people, go aboard the train." "Yes.  +

He stood there from the very beginning of the extermination action to the end." "With regard to what you were saying earlier, there's a dialogue that develops in the book between an American professor who comes to visit the doctor many years later, and is critical of what happened.  +

He says of the Jews, 'You were going like sheep to your deaths.' The professor had been in World War II; he'd landed on a French beach, and he said that 'Men should run, men should shoot.  +

You were going like sheep.' And Adelman explains this, and let me quote him.  +

'It is a horrendous thing when one is going so quietly to one's death.  +

It is infinitely more difficult than to go out shooting.  +

After all, it is much easier to die firing.  +

For us, it was much easier to die than it was for someone who first boarded a train car, then rode the train, then dug a hole, then undressed naked.' That's difficult to understand, but then Hannah Kroll says that she understands it because it's easier for people who are watching this to understand, when the people are dying shooting." "It is something probably easier to comprehend because the kind of death most of the people from the ghetto encountered is just beyond comprehension." "Explain the context of the title for Shielding the Flame ; it comes up a bit later on.  +

It has to do with the reason that Dr.  +

Adelman becomes a physician, a cardiologist, after the War, is that he wants this opportunity to deal with people who are in a life-or-death situation." "He says at some point that what he was doing at Hmflat Platz and what he was doing later on as a doctor is like to shield the flame from God who wants to blow this little tiny flame and kill the person, that what he was doing during the War and after
the War was, in a way, doing God's work or doing something against God, even if the God existed." "Do you think this book is going to be accessible to the Western reader reading it in English? It is a bit free in form and in style.  +

It lacks a chronology; certain details are not there or are pre-supposed that one knows." "This book is a little bit like a conversation of two people who aren't that much aware of the fact that someone else is listening to it.  +

And they don't care about this other person who might be listening to it.  +

They don't help this person to follow it.  +

I had a hard time even when I read it for the first time in Polish.  +

However, for me, it has magnetic power and, despite the confusion, I always wanted to go back and to go on." Yahannes Tashimska, the translator, along with Lawrence Weshler, of Shielding the Flame by Hannah Kroll.


美国国务院发言人伯纳德·卡尔布今天因里根政府涉嫌针对利比亚的虚假信息活动而辞职。 《华盛顿邮报》上周报道称，政府散布有关利比亚的虚假信息，试图破坏穆阿迈尔·库扎菲政府的稳定。卡尔布今天没有证实或否认发生过这样的活动，但他表示有关此事的报道损害了美国的信誉。美国国务院不会对卡尔布的辞职发表评论。美国国务院今天批评尼加瓜政府据称拒绝允许美国官员会见尤金·哈森福斯。他是周日尼加拉瓜境内飞机失事的幸存者。美国国务院发言人查尔斯·雷德蒙德。 “我们的代表没有受到尼加拉瓜政府的接待。我们以最严肃的态度看待这一问题。提供领事服务是大使馆职能的重要组成部分。桑地诺政府再次采取行动，使这一职能变得困难和困难。”提出了美国大使馆能否在尼加拉瓜境内正常运作的问题。坦率地说，我们不能接受推迟给予领事探访权，因为桑地诺政府显然已经不遗余力地在媒体面前炫耀哈森福斯先生，并考虑到事实上，政府发言人昨晚在美国电视上明确表示将授予访问权限。”与此同时，里根总统今天否认这架据称向反叛分子运送武器的被击落飞机是根据美国官方命令执行任务的。他还承认，政府已经意识到美国私人团体和公民一直在帮助尼加拉瓜的反政府力量。 上周《华盛顿邮报》报道称，高层官员已批准一项计划，旨在制造真实和虚幻的事件，让利比亚上校穆阿迈尔·库达菲认为美国可能会再次发动袭击。伯纳德·卡尔布的辞职是第一个抗议这一政策的人。 1983年，白宫也发生过类似的辞职事件，当时一名副手辞职是为了抗议美国入侵格林纳达前不久向媒体发表的误导性言论。 NPR 的比尔·布森伯格 (Bill Busenberg) 对今天的公告有更多报道。伯纳德·卡尔布曾是哥伦比亚广播公司和全国广播公司的资深外交记者，两年前被国务卿乔治·舒尔茨选为国务院首席发言人，正式担任公共事务助理国务卿。他的兄弟马文·卡尔布 (Marvin Kalb) 仍在 NBC 工作。今天，伯纳德·卡尔布因政府虚假信息计划问题辞职，令他在新闻媒体的前同事感到惊讶。卡尔布不愿证实是否有这样的计划，但他表示，他面临着保持沉默或表达异议的选择。尽管这个问题似乎已经从新闻中消失，卡尔布私下里还是在努力解决这个问题，并决定他必须采取行动。 “争议可能会消失，但当你独自一人坐着时，它不会消失。所以我采取了下台的步骤。”据报道，国务院已介入虚假信息问题，但卡尔布表示，他的指导方针一直是不撒谎或误导媒体，而且他也没有这样做。卡尔布今天特意赞扬了舒尔茨国务卿，他说，他是一个非常正直的人，他允许其他人拥有自己的正直。 “在采取这一行动时，我想强调，我并不是反对国务卿舒尔茨，他是一个有信誉的人，而是反对所报道的虚假信息计划。”卡尔布的评论表明舒尔茨可能不同意虚假信息计划，但在公开场合，国务卿上周在纽约为政府针对利比亚的政策辩护：“我对小小的心理战没有任何问题反对库达菲。”他还引用了温斯蒂安·丘吉尔的话：“在战争时期，真相是如此珍贵，必须有谎言的保镖守护。”舒尔茨被问及上周日美国广播公司的虚假信息活动。 “我不撒谎。我从来没有参加过任何会议，其中有人提议我们出去向新闻媒体撒谎以达到某种效果。如果有人这样做，他就是违反政策的。现在说，从我们收到的所有情报来看，我们对利比亚采取行动的结果之一是库扎菲在一段时间内迷失了方向。因此，在某种程度上，我们可以通过某种方式让库扎菲失去平衡，包括我们可能再次发动攻击的可能性，我认为这很好。”在今天与记者的一次有时情绪激动的会议上，伯纳德·卡尔布表示，他个人和整个国家都无法忍受任何虚假信息政策。 “我担心任何此类计划对美国信誉的影响。信仰，对美国话语的信仰，是我们民主的脉搏。任何损害美国信誉的事情都会伤害美国。然后在很大程度上，低得多的水平，我自己的可信度存在问题，无论是作为发言人还是记者，担任了几年的发言人，担任记者的时间比我想记得的还要长。 事实上，我有时私下里认为自己是一名伪装成发言人的记者。无论如何，我不希望自己的信誉被卷入这场争议之中。”卡尔布今天采取行动的时机可能会加剧有关政府欺骗的争议。对于里根政府，就在几天前与苏联在冰岛举行重要的峰会前会议，以及官方否认一架游击队补给飞机在尼加拉瓜被击落之后。在那次行动中，一名美国人被俘，其他人被杀，但官员们表示，航班与美国政府没有任何关系。卡尔布说他今天的辞职与任何其他事件无关。我是华盛顿的比尔·布森伯格。波兰犹太人的历史并不总是在这个国家被彻底讲述。二战期间华沙犹太区自由战士的故事是最悲伤的篇章之一。纳粹杀害了数十万犹太人，德国入侵时，还有七千人为保卫该地区而牺牲。梅里克·阿德尔曼博士是极少数幸存者之一。一本名为《屏蔽火焰》的书就是他的故事。这是汉娜·克罗尔十岁时在波兰写成的。现在该国家/地区有英文版。约翰内斯·托希姆斯卡 (Yohannes Toshimska) 是其中一位译者。她说，梅里克·阿德尔曼对贫民窟起义的看法被认为是非传统的。 “他不使用这种语言，甚至他没有人们通常对大屠杀和贫民窟起义的态度。他一直在谈论的一件事是，人们认为是贫民窟里的武器。这不是什么英雄事；这比死在火车车厢里还要容易。 从某种意义上说，参与贫民窟起义的人们实际上是幸运的。他们有武器；他们可以对正在发生的事情做点什么，而那些被带到火车车厢的数十万人同样英勇，但他们的死要困难得多。”阿德尔曼被派驻……他在一家诊所工作；那时他还不是医生；但他在火车站附近的一家诊所工作，犹太人被带到那里去集中营。” “是的。他的地位非常惊人。他站在赫姆弗拉特广场的门口，犹太人就是从这里被带上火车车厢的。他是贫民窟地下组织的成员，他正在选择地下组织需要的人。他们可能只是每天被带到汽车前的数千人中的一两个。他会把这些人接起来，然后护士学校的年轻女孩会让这些人失去行动能力。他在书中描述，这是一个非常震撼的场景，这些穿着漂亮干净的白色护士学生制服的女孩如何拿两块木头，用这两块木头打断那些本来应该打断的人的腿。为犹太地下组织而保存。但德国人直到最后一刻都想维持这样的假象：被带上火车的人是被带去上班的。显然，腿断了的人无法工作。所以打断一条腿可以暂时避免那个人被毒气熏死。” “所以他总共看到了，我相信他说四十万人，上火车。” “是的。从灭杀行动开始到结束，他都站在那里。” “关于你之前所说的，书中有一段对话发生在一位多年后来看医生的美国教授之间，并对所发生的事情提出了批评。他谈到犹太人时说：“你们就像羊一样走向死亡。”这位教授曾参加过第二次世界大战；他降落在法国海滩上，他说‘男人应该逃跑，男人应该开枪。你就像绵羊一样。阿德尔曼解释了这一点，让我引用他的话。 “当一个人如此安静地走向死亡时，这是一件可怕的事情。这比出去拍摄要困难无数倍。毕竟，射击死要容易得多。对我们来说，死比那些先登上火车车厢，然后乘坐火车，然后挖洞，然后赤身裸体的人要容易得多。这很难理解，但汉娜·克罗尔说她能理解这一点，因为当人们在枪击中死去时，观看此视频的人更容易理解。”来自贫民区的人们所遇到的事情简直令人无法理解。” “解释一下《屏蔽火焰》标题的背景；稍后会出现。这与阿德尔曼博士在战后成为一名医生、心脏病专家的原因有关，因为他希望有机会与那些处于生死攸关的人打交道。”“他在某个时候说。他在 Hmflat Platz 所做的事情以及他后来作为一名医生所做的事情就像是保护火焰免受上帝的侵害，而上帝想要吹灭这个小小的火焰并杀死人，他在战争期间和战后所做的事情在某种程度上，战争是在做上帝的工作，或者做一些反对上帝的事情，即使上帝存在。” “你认为西方读者可以用英文阅读这本书吗？它在形式和风格上有点自由。它缺乏年代顺序；某些细节不存在或预先假设人们知道。”“这本书有点像两个人的对话，他们不太意识到其他人正在听它。他们并不关心可能正在听的其他人。他们不会帮助这个人遵循它。即使我第一次读到波兰语版的这本书，我也感到很困难。然而，对我来说，它具有磁力，尽管令人困惑，我总是想回去并继续下去。”汉娜·克罗尔（Hannah Kroll）的《屏蔽火焰》（Shielding the Flame）的译者雅汉内斯·塔希姆斯卡（Yahannes Tashimska）与劳伦斯·韦什勒（Lawrence Weshler）一起翻译。
