[.my2]
它要求在足球赛季期间进行两次突击测试，但卡舍尔表示，罗泽尔缺乏在不经过集体谈判程序的情况下实施该计划的权力。美国宇航局今天公布了其改造航天飞机助推火箭的最新进展。

托马斯承认，如果美国宇航局遵循国家研究委员会独立工程师的建议，测试可能需要更长时间。

Those engineers suggested additional tests beyond what NASA has planned.

[.my2]
这些工程师建议进行超出美国宇航局计划的额外测试。

But Thomas said NASA might run some of those tests after the first shuttle flight.

[.my2]
但托马斯表示，美国宇航局可能会在第一次航天飞机飞行后进行一些测试。

For example, NASA might delay tests for unusually hot or cold launch conditions.

[.my2]
例如，美国宇航局可能会推迟针对异常炎热或寒冷的发射条件的测试。

He said NASA would just make sure the weather was mild at lift-off until those tests were completed.

The narrow cobblestoned streets and the pink toned medieval churches of Assisi were the backdrop today of one of the most colorful and spectacular events organized by Pope John Paul II since he assumed the Papacy eight years ago.

[.my2]

[.my2]

[.my2]

[.my2]
教宗随后发表演讲，强调世界宗教尽管存在差异，但仍有共同点。

"Besides, we also make the world looking at us through the media, moreover, of the responsibilities of religion regarding problems of war and peace." The ceremony ended with the release of hundreds of doves as the choir sang "Saint Francis Canticle to Father Sun and Sister Moon." As the ceremony was coming to a close, the Vatican announced that the Pope's appeal for a truce of all conflicts raging throughout the world had been widely respected.

[.my2]
“此外，我们还通过媒体让世界关注我们宗教在战争与和平问题上的责任。”仪式以数百只鸽子被释放而结束，唱诗班唱着“圣弗朗西斯颂歌给太阳父亲和月亮姐妹”。仪式即将结束时，梵蒂冈宣布教皇关于世界各地所有冲突停战的呼吁已得到广泛尊重。

For National Public Radio, this is Sylvisa Perjoli in Assisi.

[.my2]
我是国家公共广播电台的西尔维萨·佩尔乔利 (Sylvisa Perjoli)，来自阿西西。

The "American Century" has become the "American Crisis," and that happened in just twenty-five years.

[.my2]
“美国世纪”已经变成了“美国危机”，而这仅仅发生了二十五年。

That's the theme of David Halberstam's latest book called The Reckoning .

[.my2]
这是大卫·哈尔伯斯坦最新著作《清算》的主题。

It's the story of the Ford Motor Company and the story of Nissan, a Japanese car maker since the late 1930s.

[.my2]
这是福特汽车公司和 20 世纪 30 年代末以来的日本汽车制造商日产汽车的故事。

It is now a very successful importer to the US.

[.my2]
它现在是美国非常成功的进口商。

Basically Halberstam believes the American automobile industry, Detroit since the Second World War, became a shared de facto monopoly failing to listen to congress, failing to notice Japan, and mostly failing, he says, because the car companies came under the control of the financial people rather than the car people.

[.my2]
哈尔伯斯坦基本上认为，自第二次世界大战以来，底特律的美国汽车工业成为了事实上的共同垄断，没有听取国会的意见，没有注意到日本，而且大部分都失败了，他说，因为汽车公司受到了金融机构的控制。人而不是车人。

David Halberstam talks with us now about one very important year in auto biz, 1964, and about several important people, beginning with Yutaca Catayama of Nissan.

[.my2]
David Halberstam 现在与我们谈论汽车行业非常重要的一年，即 1964 年，以及几位重要人物，首先是日产汽车公司的 Yutaca Catayama。

"Catayama, who is a kind of exuberant, somewhat aristocratic man, was very frustrated.

[.my2]
“卡塔山是一个精力充沛、有点贵族气质的人，他非常沮丧。

At home in Tokyo, there seemed to be no place for him in the company.

[.my2]
在东京的家里，公司里似乎没有他的位置。

He loved making cars.

[.my2]
他喜欢制造汽车。

He was on the wrong side politically, and that's a very political company.

[.my2]
他在政治上站在了错误的一边，而那是一家非常政治化的公司。

And so he was almost exiled to America on the assumption that selling cars in America would be a sure place: if you wanted someone to fail, that's what you would do.

[.my2]
因此，他几乎被流放到美国，因为他认为在美国销售汽车将是一个确定的地方：如果你希望某人失败，那就是你会做的。

And he came here, and he loved America.

[.my2]
他来到这里，他热爱美国。

I mean, he was more at home, oddly enough, in America than he was in Japan.

[.my2]
我的意思是，奇怪的是，他在美国比在日本更自在。

In the beginning he would almost, I mean, sell cars hand by hand.

[.my2]
我的意思是，一开始他几乎会手工销售汽车。

He would go to the Japanese gardeners in Los Angeles and sell these little pick-up trucks and he found these, you know, almost used car dealers whom he convinced to be Nissan dealers, and he would hand …​

[.my2]
他会去洛杉矶的日本园丁那里卖掉这些小皮卡车，他找到了这些，你知道的，几乎是二手车经销商，他说服他们是日产经销商，然后他会把……​

he'd drive the cars down to their lots, and he got to know the business, and just it began to surface in '64.

[.my2]
他会把车开到他们的停车场，他开始了解这项业务，直到 64 年才开始浮出水面。

That's a very important demarcation point, 1964." "You mention the pick-up trucks they were trying to sell on the west coast.

[.my2]
那是一个非常重要的分界点，1964 年。” “你提到了他们试图在西海岸销售的皮卡车。

It is funny the correspondence back and forth between the west coast and Tokyo that the Japanese in Tokyo don't believe that Americans should be riding in pick-up trucks as passenger vehicles and refuse to accommodate some design changes." "Well, factories in those days were not very technologically advanced.

[.my2]
有趣的是，西海岸和东京之间的来回通信，东京的日本人不相信美国人应该乘坐皮卡车作为客车，并且拒绝适应一些设计变更。”那个时代技术还不是很先进。

I mean, they have this wonderful work force, and they have this enormous ambition and this willingness as to pay a high price.

[.my2]
我的意思是，他们拥有出色的劳动力，他们有巨大的野心，也愿意付出高昂的代价。

But their cars were very primitive really, like American cars in the '30s.

[.my2]
但他们的汽车确实非常原始，就像 30 年代的美国汽车一样。

But the truck they were building was like a small tank and was very inexpensive, and they were started selling on the west coast.

[.my2]
但他们制造的卡车就像一辆小坦克，而且非常便宜，他们开始在西海岸销售。

And for the first couple years, the little truck was what carried the company.

[.my2]
在最初的几年里，小卡车是公司的承载者。

I mean that's where they made their inroads.

[.my2]
我的意思是，这就是他们取得进展的地方。

And Catayama kept saying, 'You know, you don't under …​' to the home-office.

[.my2]
卡塔亚马一直对总部说：“你知道，你不……”。

'You don't understand Americans.

[.my2]
“你不了解美国人。

They drive the truck, I mean, pick-up truck.

[.my2]
他们开卡车，我是说，皮卡车。

That's a car for them, I mean, they'll work in it, and they'll play in it; they'll go to the bank in it; they'll go to a drive-in movie in it.

[.my2]
我的意思是，这对他们来说是一辆汽车，他们会在里面工作，他们会在里面玩耍；他们会在里面工作。他们会穿着它去银行；他们会去里面看一场免下车电影。

Can we put some air conditioner? Can we make it more comfortable? Can we put in a radio?' And Tokyo kept saying, you know, 'No, no, no, no.

[.my2]
可以加点空调吗？我们可以让它变得更舒服吗？我们可以安装收音机吗？东京一直说，你知道，‘不，不，不，不。

It should not be used for those things.

[.my2]
它不应该用于那些事情。

We want the Americans just to drive it as a truck.' You know Catayama just had a feeling that they were losing all these sales.

[.my2]
我们希望美国人把它当作卡车来驾驶。”你知道卡塔山只是有一种感觉，他们正在失去所有这些销售。

He mostly did not win the battle on the truck, but he won a lot other battles." "Talking about '64, just about the time the Japanese car workers had begun to be able to afford the Japanese car and much earlier in your book, writing about the original Henry Ford, you talk about the time that Ford decided to pay his employees five dollars a day, as been an incredibly revolutionary time in American labor history." "I think that he revolutionized the economy and the idea of the worker as the consumer.

[.my2]
他大多没有赢得卡车上的战斗，但他赢得了很多其他战斗。”“谈到 64 年，就在日本汽车工人开始能够买得起日本汽车的时候，而且在你的书中更早的时候在写关于最初的亨利·福特的文章时，你谈到了福特决定每天向员工支付五美元的时间，这是美国劳工史上令人难以置信的革命性时刻。”“我认为他彻底改变了经济和劳动观念。工人作为消费者。

I mean if there is a thing called the "American Century,' it is also a thing called the 'Oil Century.' The two are the same, and the coming of the first Henry Ford with the Model T at the very beginning of the century, at the very same time when you have these huge oil gushers down in the Southwest—its spindle top which supplies the inexpensive energy—you begin to get the oil culture.

[.my2]
我的意思是，如果有一个叫做“美国世纪”的东西，那么它也是一个叫做“石油世纪”的东西。两者是相同的，第一辆亨利·福特和 T 型车在本世纪初问世，就在同一时间，西南地区有这些巨大的石油喷井——它的主轴顶部提供廉价的石油。能源——你开始了解石油文化。

And then very quickly you have small gas engines, and you have items which are consumer items.

[.my2]
然后很快你就有了小型燃气发动机，并且你有了消费品。

What Henry ford did was bring mass production and finally create a cycle in which, for the first time, in the industrial would, the worker was also a consumer.

[.my2]
亨利·福特所做的是带来大规模生产，并最终创造出一个循环，在工业中，工人第一次也是消费者。

And when he paid for the first time five dollars a day, everybody else in the industrial sector jumped on his back, you know, and said, 'he was ruining us.' This would, you know cause all kinds of social chaos, that workers couldn't handle that much money.

[.my2]
当他第一次支付每天五美元的费用时，工业部门的其他人都跳到了他的背上，你知道，并说，“他正在毁掉我们。”你知道，这会导致各种社会混乱，工人们无法处理那么多钱。

But he was very skillfully creating this cycle, and he knew that he could build this many cars, but there's no sense in building them if people couldn't buy them.

[.my2]
但他非常熟练地创造了这个循环，他知道他可以制造这么多汽车，但如果人们买不到它们，那么制造它们就没有意义。

And the worker became the consumer." "Let me ask you for an explanation of this man.

[.my2]
然后工人就变成了消费者。” “让我请你解释一下这个人。

His name is Kadsundo Kohamu.

[.my2]
他的名字叫卡松多·科哈穆。

This is a Japanese name given …​

[.my2]
这是一个日本名字……​

taken by an American." "Yes, his name …​

[.my2]
被美国人带走了。”“是的，他的名字……​

well, that means William the Conqueror, I believe, in rough translation.

[.my2]
好吧，我相信，粗略地翻译，这意味着征服者威廉。

His real name—he was born, I suppose, well, in the other century—is a man named William Reagan Gorham.

[.my2]
他的真名——我想，嗯，他出生在另一个世纪——是一个名叫威廉·里根·戈勒姆的人。

And he was a wonderful tinker that the kind that we were producing in the very beginning of the twentieth century, men who just loved this moment of explosion of machinery.

[.my2]
他是一位出色的修补匠，正是我们在二十世纪初培养的那种人，他们只是喜欢机械爆炸的时刻。

He was like a Henry Ford, who came along a few years after Ford.

[.my2]
他就像亨利·福特，比福特晚了几年。

In fact, the original Henry Ford was his God.

[.my2]
事实上，原来的亨利·福特就是他的上帝。

And he was trying to …​

[.my2]
他试图……​

and he invented everything; he could do almost everything.

[.my2]
他发明了一切；他几乎可以做任何事情。

And frustrated in America, because there seemed to be no place for him, he went over to Japan to …​

[.my2]
在美国感到沮丧，因为似乎没有他的位置，他去了日本……​

originally to design airplanes during World War I.

[.my2]
最初是在第一次世界大战期间设计飞机。

Loved it there.

[.my2]
喜欢那里。

Became kind of a sort of industrial or mechanical missionary there.

[.my2]
在那里成为某种工业或机械传教士。

And he would invent motorized little vehicles.

[.my2]
他还发明了小型机动车辆。

He invented the diesel engines, airplanes, and finally, he really was, in all respects, the inventor of the first Datsun car.

[.my2]
他发明了柴油发动机、飞机，最后，从各方面来看，他确实是第一辆 Datsun 汽车的发明者。

I mean, the intriguing thing that this American, because the Japanese are so good at absorbing other people' knowledge, he invented the first Datsun.

[.my2]
我的意思是，有趣的是，这个美国人，因为日本人非常善于吸收别人的知识，所以他发明了第一个 Datsun。

He came to love Japan.

[.my2]
他开始爱上日本。

I mean, for him, it was a country loved many of the values, systems of the respect for work, the cleanliness, whatever the country.

[.my2]
我的意思是，对他来说，这是一个热爱许多价值观、尊重工作、清洁的制度的国家，无论是哪个国家。

And he was honored there.

[.my2]
他在那里受到了荣誉。

He was never interested in making very much money.

[.my2]
他从来没有对赚很多钱感兴趣。

As Would War II began to approach, he became very melancholy, because he saw his adopted country and his native country about to do go war.

[.my2]
随着第二次世界大战的临近，他变得非常忧郁，因为他看到他的移居国和他的祖国即将开战。

He argued, without very much success, on both sides to …​

[.my2]
他双方都主张……，但没有取得很大成功。

in ways that would sort of cut off the growing confrontation.

[.my2]
以某种方式切断日益加剧的对抗。

And on the very eve, he took up Japanese citizenship, this name and told his then colleague sons to go back to America before it was too late.

[.my2]
就在前夕，他获得了日本公民身份（这个名字），并告诉他当时同事的儿子们在为时已晚之前回到美国。

And he is buried there.

[.my2]
他被埋在那里。

It is an extraordinary life.

[.my2]
这是一个非凡的人生。
