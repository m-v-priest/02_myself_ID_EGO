Lesson28


President Reagan addresses the nation in about three hours to explain what happened during his meetings this weekend with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.  +
The meetings did not produce any arms control agreements, nor did they produce a date for another summit between the two leaders.  +
America's NATO allies were disappointed at the lack of an agreement, especially the failure to rid Europe of medium-range US and Soviet missiles.  +
But they urged the two Superpowers to keep talking.  +
And British Foreign Office Minister Timothy Renton said he was surprised that the two leaders had made as much progress as they did, and said he didn't agree that the meetings had ended in failure.  +
"I would regard what has happened in Iceland as by no manner of means the end of the play, but rather as one act in this extremely important, in this extremely important series of discussions.  +
There is now an interval between the acts.  +
We hope that it will be a short interval and that the parties involved will resume and take up the next act very quickly." The next act will likely be in Geneva where Renton said he presumes that the material introduced in Iceland will be worked on and developed.  +
Some seventy thousand government workers in San Salvador returned to their jobs today just three days after an earthquake hit the city.  +
El Salvador's President Jose Napoleon Duarte said nearly nine hundred people were killed in the quake and more than two hundred thousand left homeless.  +
Duarte ordered civil servants back to work, although he said almost all public buildings suffered some kind of damage.  +
Duarte estimates the earthquake caused two billion dollars worth of damage.  +
Damage is expected to total into the tens of millions of dollars after several days of
flooding in south central Alaska.  +
But it's believed no one has been hurt.  +
Tim Wolston, of member station KSKA in Anchorage reports.  +
"As many as fifteen homes have been destroyed and hundreds more damaged in the town of Seward, southeast of Anchorage.  +
The main road leading into Seward has been washed away, cutting off the town from outside.  +
Mayor Harry Giesler says hundreds have been evacuated; others prefer to wait it out.  +
'You know, Alaskans are a very hearty bunch, and especially people that have things like dog teams and animals.  +
They are very, very reluctant to leave their home as long as it's even there.' Rain is forecast to continue for at least another day in Seward.  +
Meanwhile, north of Anchorage, two bridges have been washed away, and the Alaska Railroad, a major form of transportation between Anchorage and Fairbanks has been cut off, making it very difficult for residents in interior Alaska to get to Five.  +
The governor has issued disaster declarations to free up state fund for emergency relief.  +
The state is hoping for federal assistance as well.  +
For National Public Radio, this is Tim Wolston in Anchorage, Alaska." Today was a day for sorting out the summit in Iceland.  +
How did it happen that the two most powerful men of earth stepped to the threshold of a dramatic arms control accord and then stepped back? The talks foundered on the President's Strategic Defense Initiative, or SDI.  +
"While both sides seek reduction in the number of nuclear missiles and war heads threatening the world, the Soviet Union insisted that we sign an agreement that would deny to me and to future presidents for ten years the right to develop, test, and deploy a defense against nuclear missiles for the people of the free world.  +
This we could not and will not do." "The President insisted, until the end, on retaining for the United States the right to test, to have experiments and to test things relating to SDI not only in the laboratories but also out of laboratories, including in space.  +
So who was going to accept that? It would have taken a madman to accept that." The translated remarks yesterday by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and remarks by President Reagan.  +
We'll hear defenders and critics of SDI later in tonight's program, but first NPR's Jim Angle, just back from Iceland, joins us to discuss what the two leaders almost achieved.  +
"It is really amazing when you look at what the two Superpowers were able to do really in a period of twenty-four hours beginning with the experts meetings on Saturday night.  +
In that twenty-four-hour-period, the two sides agreed to the most sweeping arms control proposals in the history of negotiations between the US and the Soviet Union.  +
They agreed to fifty percent cuts in all offensive weapons, all offensive strategic weapons over five years, then went beyond that later on, in a proposal from President Reagan, to eliminate all offensive ballistic missiles at the end of a ten-year period.  +
They also agreed on INF, or intermediate-range nuclear weapons, which are now both in Europe and in Asia.  +
In the Soviet case, they agreed to eliminate all intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe and to reduce those in Asia by eighty-five percent to one hundred warheads, leaving the US with one
hundred warheads as well.  +
These were the kind of cuts in nuclear weapons that no one anticipated when they came to Iceland.  +
At first the US did not expect the negotiations to be that detailed, nor did anyone anticipate that two sides would actually start moving that quickly on something that they had been talking about for so long and been unable to do." "Tell us more about what the mood was like in Hofdi House during the negotiations." "The arms control experts met all night.  +
They began at 8 p.m., quit at 6:30 the next morning.  +
The two leaders were briefed by their respective groups somewhere around 9 o'clock that morning and began meeting again at 10.  +
Then they started moving very quickly on the negotiations.  +
The Soviets came back, for instance, and quickly resolved the medium-range missiles issue after some argument for quite a while.  +
At this point, the negotiators, the advisors on the US side, some of them said that what was happening was really breathtaking because they were beginning to sense that these things were falling together, that there was this enormous movement between the two sides, movement in both their positions, that no one had anticipated when they arrived in Iceland.  +
At that point, even President Reagan apparently asked some of his advisors whether or not they were moving too fast, whether or not they were going too far.  +
And they would re-examine positions to make sure that things weren't moving so quickly that they didn't realize the implications of what they were doing.  +
In fact, one advisor said on one particular issue President Reagan said, 'No.  +
That is too far.  +
We will not go with that opposition.' At the very end, the advisors did not know what was happening; in fact at one point, when the first meeting broke up on Sunday—it was supposed to be the last meeting—they were out in the motorcade in the cars until they found out President Reagan had told the media that they were meeting again.  +
They got out of cars, went back into Hofdi House.  +
At the very end, they did not know what was happening in the talks.  +
They got word that the two leaders were finished, that they were going out of the building.  +
They went down the stairs, looked over the stairwell, had no idea at this point what the result of the discussions had been.  +
And then officials in the back asked one official in the front who could see the two leaders, 'What did their faces look like?' That official said, 'They're not smiling.' And at that point, they knew that nothing had been agreed to and they had come so close to such a major agreement and they had failed." "Well, everything fell apart at the last meeting because of the Strategic Defensive Initiative.  +
What were the points of disagreement?" "Well, there were basically two.  +
The Soviets wanted to restrict SDI work to the laboratory which the US says is a more restrictive interpretation of the ABM Treaty, the Anti-Ballistic Missiles Treaty, than anyone has ever proposed.  +
Also that at the end of ten years, the Soviets wanted to begin discussions about deployment; the Americans wanted, insisted that they had the right to deploy at the end of ten years.  +
Throughout three drafts of language on this, the Soviets continued to insist on limiting SDI to the laboratory; the Americans hoped that they would eventually drop it, as they do sometimes in negotiations.  +
But they did not.  +
The interesting thing here is that the Soviets had sweetened the deal to such an extent, had laid out this
amazing agreement between the two, that the two powers had come so close to this major agreement that this was, they hoped, the bait that would get President Reagan to adopt what people in the United States have called 'the grand compromise', which was to trade SDI for deproductions in offensive missies.  +
At the end, the President rejected that.  +
And American official think that they have not lost that deal.  +
And the question now is what will happen next.  +
What will US and the US and the Soviet Union agree to or fail to agree to in the Geneva arms talks?" "OK.  +
Thank you.  +
NPR's Jim Angle." For the next ninety minutes we will be questioning the candidates for president of the United States, following a format designed and agreed to by representatives of the two candidates.  +
The candidates are Vice-President George Bush, the Republican nominee, Governor Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee.  +
Our questions this evening will be about equally divided between foreign and domestic policy matters.  +
The first question by agreement between the two candidates goes to Vice-president Bush.  +
It is a domestic question.  +
You have two minutes for an answer, Sir.  +
The polls say the number one domestic issue to majority of voters is drugs.  +
What is there about these times that drives or draws so many Americans to use drugs? "I think we've seen a deterioration of values.  +
I think for a while as a nation we condoned those, those things we should have condemned for a while, as I recall, it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing, eh, or decriminalizing, eh, marijuana and other drugs.  +
And I think that's all wrong.  +
So we've seen a deterioration in values.  +
And one of the things that I think we should do about it, in terms of cause, is to instill values into the young people in our schools.  +
We've got away.  +
We've got this feeling that the value-free education was a thing.  +
And I don't believe it at all.  +
I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as youth.  +
And of course, as far as the ...  +
how we make it better.  +
Yes, we can do better on interdiction.  +
But we've got to do a lot better on inter-...  +
and we've got to do a lot better on education.  +
And we have to do ...  +
be tougher on those who commit crimes.  +
We've got to get after the users more.  +
We have to change this whole culture.  +
You know, I saw a movie, Crocodile Dundee .  +
And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as though this was a humorous little incident.  +
It's bad.  +
Everybody ought to be in this thing, entertainment industry, people involved in the school's education.  +
And it isn't a Republican or a Democrat or liberal problem.  +
But we have got to instill values in these young people.  +
And ...  +
ah, I have put forward a ...  +
many point drug program the includes what I would do as president of the United States in Terms of doing better on interdiction, in terms of doing better in the neighborhoods.  +
But I think we are all in this together.  +
And my plead to the American people is values in the schools." Governor, you have one minute to respond.  +
"I agree with Mr.  +
Bush that values are important.  +
But it's important that our leaders demonstrate those values form the top.  +
That means those of us who are elected to
positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves.  +
Here we are with a government that's been dealing with the drug running petty dictator.  +
We've been dealing with him.  +
He's been dealing drugs to our kids.  +
Governors like me and others have been trying to do with the consequences.  +
I remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing something we called 'the Governors' Alliance against Drugs', and a young sixteen-year-old girl coming up to me, desperate, addicted, dependent, saying, 'Governor, I need help,' We are providing that young woman with help.  +
But I want to be a President of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with the drug running petty dictator, that we never again funnel aid to the 'contras' and the convicted drug dealers.  +
Values begin at the top, in the White House.  +
Those are the values I want to be ...  +
bring to Presidency and White House beginning January 1989." Governor, a follow-up question.  +
You have two minutes to answer it.  +
Are you suggesting, sir, that President Reagan is one of causes of the drug problem in this country? "I'm saying that those of us who are elected to the position of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs and I have outlined and detailed a very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education of prevention.  +
And Mr.  +
Bush is right.  +
The two go hand in hand.  +
But if our government itself is doing business itself with people who, we know, are engaged in drug profiteering an drug trafficking, if we don't understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, and it's a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and young people like her all over the country and say to them, 'We want to help you." "Now, I've outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemisphere's summit.  +
Soon after the twentieth of January, we'll bring out democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together.  +
We also have to take demands seriously.  +
You know we have 5% of the world's population in this country.  +
We're consuming 50% of the world's cocaine.  +
And in my state, I'm proud to say we've organized a drug education prevention program which the Federal drug enforcement administration says is a model of the country.  +
We are helping youngsters.  +
We're reaching out to them.  +
And we're beginning drug education, prevention, beginning in the early elementary grades and every elementary school in ...  +
eh ...  +
in our ...  +
eh ...  +
our state.  +
And that's the kind of help we need in every elementary school in the United States of America.  +
And we've got to begin early in the first, second and third grade before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances.  +
I guess the question I would ask of Mr.  +
Bush is, how we instill those values? How we create this environment for the drug-free schools that we want of this country? If he or representatives of the administration...ah...are either dealing with and involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or don't pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over this country."
A minute to ...  +
eh ...  +
rebut, Mr.  +
Vice-President.  +
"On the other day my opponent was given a briefing by the CIA.  +
I asked for and received the same briefing.  +
I'm very careful in public life about dealing with classified information.  +
And what I'm about to say is unclassified.  +
Seven administrations are dealing with Mr.  +
Noriega.  +
It was the Reagan-Buch Administration that brought this man to justice.  +
And as the governor of Massachusetts knows there was no evidence that governor ...  +
that ...  +
that eh ...  +
Mr.  +
Noriega was involved in drugs, no hard evidence until we indicted him.  +
And so I think it's about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective.  +
Panama is a friendly country.  +
I went down there and talked to the President of Panama about cleaning up their mon...  +
money laundering.  +
And Mr.  +
Noriega was there.  +
But there was no evidence at that time.  +
And when the evidence was there, we indicted him and we want to bring him to justice and so call up for those pickets-up there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations."




里根总统在大约三个小时内向全国发表讲话，解释他本周末与苏联领导人米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫会面时发生的情况。会议没有达成任何军控协议，也没有确定两国领导人再次举行峰会的日期。美国的北约盟国对未能达成协议感到失望，尤其是未能让欧洲摆脱美国和苏联的中程导弹。但他们敦促两个超级大国继续对话。英国外交部长蒂莫西·伦顿表示，他对两位领导人取得如此大的进展感到惊讶，并表示他不同意会议以失败告终。 “我认为冰岛发生的事情绝不是戏剧的结束，而是这一极其重要的一系列讨论中的一个动作。现在，各幕之间有一个间隔。我们希望这将是一个很短的间隔，有关各方将很快恢复并采取下一步行动。”下一幕可能会在日内瓦举行，伦顿表示，他认为在冰岛引入的材料将得到研究和开发。圣萨尔瓦多大约七万名政府工作人员今天在地震袭击该市三天后返回工作岗位。萨尔瓦多总统何塞·拿破仑·杜阿尔特表示，近九百人在地震中丧生，逾二十万人无家可归。杜阿尔特命令公务员重返工作岗位，尽管他表示几乎所有公共建筑都遭受了某种程度的损坏。杜阿尔特估计地震造成了价值 20 亿美元的损失。阿拉斯加中南部发生几天的洪水后，预计损失总额将达到数千万美元。 但据信没有人受伤。安克雷奇 KSKA 会员站蒂姆·沃尔斯顿 (Tim Wolston) 报道。 “安克雷奇东南部的苏厄德镇有多达 15 所房屋被毁，数百人受损。通往苏厄德的主要道路已被冲毁，该镇与外界隔绝。市长哈里·吉斯勒表示，数百人已被疏散； “你知道，阿拉斯加人是一群非常热情的人，尤其是那些拥有狗队和动物之类的人。只要家还在，他们就非常非常不愿意离开家。”苏厄德预计降雨至少还会持续一天。同时，安克雷奇以北的两座桥梁被冲毁，安克雷奇和费尔班克斯之间的主要交通阿拉斯加铁路也被切断，这使得人们出行非常困难。 “阿拉斯加内陆地区的居民将到达五号。州长已发布灾难声明，以腾出州资金用于紧急救援。该州也希望得到联邦援助。国家公共广播电台的记者是阿拉斯加州安克雷奇的蒂姆·沃尔斯顿。”今天是整理冰岛峰会的日子。地球上最有权势的两个人是如何一步步迈出戏剧性军控协议的门槛，然后又退缩的呢？会谈因总统战略防御计划（SDI）而失败。 “虽然双方都寻求减少威胁世界的核导弹和核弹头的数量，但苏联坚持要求我们签署一项协议，该协议将在十年内剥夺我和未来总统开发、测试和部署核导弹的权利。为自由世界人民防御核导弹。这是我们不能也不会做的。” “总统坚持到最后，保留美国进行与 SDI 相关的测试、实验和测试的权利，不仅在实验室，而且在实验室外，包括在太空。那么谁会接受呢？ ” 昨天翻译的苏联领导人米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫的言论和里根总统的言论。我们将在今晚的节目稍后听到 SDI 的捍卫者和批评者，但首先是刚从冰岛回来的 NPR 的吉姆·安格尔。 ，与我们一起讨论两位领导人几乎取得的成就。“当你看到这两个超级大国在周六晚上的专家会议开始的二十四小时内真正能够做到的事情时，真是令人惊奇。在那二十四小时内，双方同意了美苏谈判史上最全面的军控建议。他们同意在五年内削减所有进攻性武器和所有进攻性战略武器百分之五十，然后在里根总统的提议中进一步削减，在十年期结束时消除所有进攻性弹道导弹。他们还就 INF（中程核武器）达成一致，这些武器目前已部署在欧洲和亚洲。就苏联而言，他们同意消除欧洲的所有中程核武器，并将亚洲的中程核武器减少百分之八十五至一百枚弹头，从而使美国也拥有一百枚弹头。当来到冰岛时，没有人预料到会出现这样的核武器削减。 起初美国并没有预料到谈判会如此详细，也没有人预料到双方会如此迅速地就他们已经谈论了很长时间但无法做到的事情开始采取行动。”谈判期间霍夫迪宫的气氛如何。” “军控专家开会了一整夜。他们晚上8点开始，第二天早上6点30分结束。当天上午 9 点左右，两位领导人听取了各自小组的通报，并于 10 点再次开始会面。然后他们开始快速推进谈判。比如，苏联人回来后，经过一番争论，很快就解决了中程导弹问题。此时，谈判代表、美方顾问，他们中的一些人说，所发生的事情真是令人震惊，因为他们开始感觉到这些事情正在一起落到一起，双方之间发生了巨大的运动，运动他们的立场是，当他们到达冰岛时，没有人预料到。在这一点上，甚至连里根总统也明显问过他的一些顾问，他们的行动是否太快，是否走得太远。他们会重新审视立场，以确保事情进展不会太快，以至于他们没有意识到自己所做的事情的影响。事实上，一位顾问说，在一个特定问题上，里根总统说：“不。那太远了。我们不会同意这种反对意见。’到最后，顾问们都不知道发生了什么；事实上，当周日第一次会议结束时——这应该是最后一次会议——他们曾在汽车车队中出去，直到他们发现里根总统告诉媒体他们将再次开会。他们下了车，回到霍夫迪宅邸。到最后，他们也不知道会谈发生了什么。他们得到消息说两位领导人已经结束了，他们要离开大楼。他们下了楼梯，看了看楼梯间，此时还不知道讨论的结果是什么。然后后面的官员问前面一位可以看到两位领导人的官员，“他们的脸是什么样子？”那位官员说：“他们没有微笑。”那时，他们知道没有达成任何协议，他们如此接近达成如此重大的协议，但他们失败了。”“好吧，由于战略防御倡议，一切在上次会议上都崩溃了。分歧点是什么？” “嗯，基本上有两个。苏联希望将 SDI 工作限制在实验室内，美国称这是对《反弹道导弹条约》和《反弹道导弹条约》的更严格的解释，比任何人提出的建议都要严格。此外，在十年结束时，苏联人想开始讨论部署问题；美国人想要并坚持认为他们有权在十年结束时进行部署。在这方面的三份草案中，苏联继续坚持将 SDI 限制在实验室范围内。美国人希望他们最终会放弃它，就像他们在谈判中有时所做的那样。但他们没有。 有趣的是，苏联已经把协议甜化到了如此程度，在两国之间达成了这一令人惊奇的协议，以至于两个大国如此接近达成了这一重大协议，以至于他们希望这是诱饵让里根总统采取美国人所说的“大妥协”，即用战略防御计划换取进攻性导弹的减产。最终，总统拒绝了这一说法。美国官员认为他们并没有失去这笔交易。现在的问题是接下来会发生什么。美国和美国、苏联在日内瓦军备谈判中会同意或不同意什么？” “好的。谢谢。 NPR 的吉姆·安格。”在接下来的九十分钟里，我们将按照两位候选人代表设计并同意的格式询问美国总统候选人。候选人是副总统乔治·布什，共和党候选人，州长迈克尔·杜卡基斯，民主党候选人。今晚我们的问题将大致分为外交和国内政策问题。两位候选人一致同意的第一个问题将由布什副总统提出。这是一个国内问题。你们有两分钟时间先生，请寻求答案。民意调查显示，对大多数选民来说，首要的国内问题是毒品。在这个时代，是什么驱使或吸引这么多美国人吸毒？“我认为我们已经看到了价值观的恶化。我认为，作为一个国家，我们曾一度纵容这些事情，那些我们应该谴责一段时间的事情，我记得，在我看来，甚至有人在谈论大麻和其他毒品的合法化，呃，或非刑事化，呃。我认为这都是错误的。所以我们看到了价值观的恶化。 就事业而言，我认为我们应该做的事情之一就是向我们学校的年轻人灌输价值观。我们已经离开了。我们有这样的感觉：价值中立的教育是一回事。我根本不相信。我确实相信，对于年轻人而言，存在基本的对错。当然，至于……我们如何让它变得更好。是的，我们可以在拦截方面做得更好。但我们必须在国际比赛方面做得更好……​并且我们必须在教育方面做得更好。我们必须……对犯罪者更加严厉。我们必须更多地关注用户。我们必须改变整个文化。你知道，我看过一部电影，《鳄鱼邓迪》。我看到可卡因的场景被幽默地处理，仿佛这是一个幽默的小事件。这不好。每个人都应该从事娱乐行业，参与学校教育。这不是共和党、民主党或自由派的问题。但我们必须向这些年轻人灌输价值观。而且……啊，我提出了……多点毒品计划，其中包括我作为美国总统将在拦截方面做得更好、在社区方面做得更好方面要做的事情。但我认为我们都在一起。我向美国人民恳求的是学校的价值观。”州长，你有一分钟​​的时间回应。“我同意布什先生的观点，价值观很重要。但重要的是，我们的领导者必须展示来自高层的这些价值观。这意味着我们这些当选政治领导职位的人必须自己反映这些价值观。我们面对的是一个一直在与贩毒小独裁者打交道的政府。我们一直在和他打交道。他一直在向我们的孩子贩卖毒品。 像我和其他人这样的州长一直在努力应对后果。我记得当时在我所在州的一所高中，当时我们正在组织一个名为“州长反毒品联盟”的活动，一个十六岁的年轻女孩走到我面前，绝望、上瘾、依赖，说：“州长，我需要帮助。”我们正在为那位年轻女士提供帮助。但我想成为一名美国总统，确保我们不再与贩毒的小独裁者做生意，我们不再向“反派”和被定罪的毒贩提供援助。价值观始于白宫高层。这些是我想成为的价值观……从 1989 年 1 月开始带入总统和白宫。”州长，后续问题。你有两分钟的时间回答。先生，你是否在暗示里根总统是原因之一“我是说，我们这些当选政治领导职位的人，吉姆，负有特殊的责任，不仅要制定计划，而且我已经概述和详细说明了一个非常重要的计划，非常强有力的执行计划以及预防毒品教育。布什先生是对的。两者齐头并进。但是，如果我们的政府本身正在与那些我们知道从事毒品牟利和贩毒的人做生意，如果我们不明白这会向我们的年轻人发出一个非常非常糟糕的信息，这有点我很难理解我们如何才能接触到我谈到的那个年轻人以及全国各地像她这样的年轻人，并对他们说，‘我们想帮助你。” “现在，我已经详细概述了一项在国内外加强执法的计划，将缉毒人员的数量增加一倍，并举行西半球峰会。一月二十号过后不久，我们将在这个半球召集民主邻国和盟友，一起去工作。我们也必须认真对待要求。你知道我们国家有世界人口的 5%。我们消耗了世界上 50% 的可卡因。在我所在的州，我很自豪地说我们已经组织了一项毒品教育预防计划，联邦缉毒局称其为国家典范。我们正在帮助年轻人。我们正在联系他们。我们正在开始毒品教育和预防，从小学早期和我们州的每所小学开始。这就是我们美国每所小学都需要的帮助。在我们的孩子开始尝试这些非常非常危险的物质之前，我们必须从一年级、二年级和三年级开始。我想我要问布什先生的问题是，我们如何灌输这些价值观？我们如何为这个国家创造我们想要的无毒品学校的环境？如果他或政府代表……啊……要么与像诺列加这样的人打交道并将其纳入我们的外交政策，要么不以一种使我们有可能切断这种联系并成为一个人的方式来寻求这种联系。给我们全国的孩子们树立榜样。” 副总统先生，请花一分钟时间进行反驳。“前几天，中央情报局向我的对手做了简报。我要求并得到了同样的简报。在公共生活中，我对处理机密信息非常谨慎。 我要说的内容是非机密的。七届政府正在与诺列加先生打交道。正是里根-布赫政府将这个人绳之以法。正如马萨诸塞州州长所知，没有证据表明州长......诺列加先生参与毒品交易，在我们起诉他之前没有确凿的证据。所以我认为现在是我们正确看待诺列加问题的时候了。巴拿马是一个友好的国家。我去那里与巴拿马总统讨论了清理他们的日常洗钱活动。诺列加先生也在场。但当时没有任何证据。当证据到位时，我们起诉了他，我们想将他绳之以法，因此呼吁那些试图推翻七个不同政府的纠察队。”
