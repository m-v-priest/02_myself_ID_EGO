== 航空公司收购

image:../img/0009.svg[]

Texas Air Corporation today announced that it has agreed to buy People Express Airlines for one hundred twenty-five million dollars in securities 有价证券,抵押品.  +

Texas Air already owns Continental 大洲的；大陆的 Airlines and New York Air.  +

It is *in the process of* acquiring 购得；获得；得到 Eastern Airlines.  /目前它正在收购东方航空。 +

People Express, one of the first no-frills  （产品或服务）只包括基本元素的；无装饰的, low-fare air carriers, has been in financial trouble lately 最近；新近；近来.  +

It was forced to shut down its subsidiary 附属公司；子公司, Frontier 国界；边界；边境 Airlines.  +

Texas Air now says it will acquire Frontier's assets *as part of* its deal with People Express.  +
德克萨斯航空现在表示，它将收购边境航空资产，作为与人民航空达成协议的一部分。 +


Joining us now from New York, NPR's business reporter Barbara Mantel.  +


"Barbara, it is said this is a very attractive low price, this one hundred twenty-five million dollars in securities.  +

Besides that, why does Texas Air want People Express?" "Well, Frank Lorenzo, who is Chairman of Texas Air, will *get* airplanes *from* People Express, which he might need.  +

He will get the lowest cost work-force in the industry at People Express.  +

He will get a new terminal  航空站；航空终点站 at Newark, New Jersey 后定 that People Express is building.  /他将在新泽西州的纽瓦克, 得到"人民快递公司正在建设的"一个新航站楼。 +

He'll get flights to London, and he will get control (n.) over competition.  +

People Express *competes (v.)竞争；对抗 heavily*, especially in the northeast corridor 走廊，过道，通道;空中走廊, *with* Texas Air." /人民航空公司与德克萨斯航空公司竞争激烈，特别是在东北走廊。

"`主` *This issue of competition* `谓` has been *a sticking point* 分歧点；症结 before /for *the Department of Transportation* 运输业 /when two airlines wanted to get together.  +
此前，当两家航空公司想要合并时，竞争问题一直是交通部的症结所在。 +


How will Texas Air *get around 解决,避开 (规章或法律) it* this time?" "Well, they might not, Texas Air *wanted to acquire* East ..., or wants to acquire, Eastern Airline, and the Department of Transportation said, 'No, not unless 除非…否则不… you *sell* more landing slots, more slots in the northeast corridor *to* Pan Am *so that* we'll have some competition there.' And Texas Air *agreed to that* just last week.  +

这一次德克萨斯航空公司会如何回避这个问题呢？” “嗯，也许他们不会回避。德克萨斯航空公司想要收购东方航空，交通部却说，‘不行，除非……你们将在东北走廊的更多降落点、更多降落槽位出售给泛美航空，这样我们在那里就会有一些竞争。’而德克萨斯航空公司在上周同意了这个条件。”


That may happen again here.  +

The Department of Transportation may require 使做（某事）；使拥有（某物）；（尤指根据法规）规定 that Texas Air *sell* some slots or some gates  登机门；登机口 *to* another airline to ensure that there is still competition in the northeast part of the marketplace.  +

But Texas Air has some leverage 影响力; 杠杆作用；杠杆效力 here with the Department of Transportation because People Express is a failing 衰退的，衰弱的；衰老的;失败 company.  +

And the Department of Transportation may feel, 'Well, we'll let them buy People Express and keep it running, *rather than* 而不是 let it fail and lose all those jobs." "Mm hm.  +

Now, if the deal is approved by the Department of Transportation, *what is it likely to mean* for consumers? If there's less competition *the fares could possibly go up*." "Well, yes.  +

You would think that when you move *from* two competitors in a market *to* just one airliner that prices would just have to go up.  +

But *I want you to keep in mind that* unrestricted fares of the kind 后定 People Express offered (v.), you know, `主` wholesale 大规模的;批发的；趸售的 unrestricted fares, `谓` were being eliminated  (v.)（比赛中）淘汰 and *phased out* 逐步废除 anyway, because they were not profitable.  +
但我要你记住，人民航空所提供的无限制票价，你知道，大规模不受限制的票价，不管怎样，正在遭到淘汰，因为他们盈利性低。 +


And the Department of Transportation theory here is that if you allow mergers to *take place* 发生、举行, or many mergers to take place, you might create more efficiencies and low costs, *leading possibly to* lower fares. /从而可能降低票价 +

And also the Department of Transportation believes that there's a lot of potential competition in *the marketplace* 市场竞争.  +

Airlines can *move planes around* and buy gates, and so that if `主` an airline in a particular market segment `谓` was making a lot of money and raising prices excessively 过分地，过量地；极度, other airlines would move in and prices would be brought down through competition.  +
航空公司可以调动飞机，购买登机口，因此，如果某一特定细分市场的航空公司赚了很多钱，并过度提高价格，其他航空公司就会进入，通过竞争，价格就会降低。 +

So that it's a nice theory, the theory of potential competition *keeping* prices *in line* 使（某人）就范; 使（某人）听从吩咐, but it's sort  种类；类别；品种 of a new idea and *it's not clear that* that's really the way it would work."
这是一个很好的理论，潜在竞争理论使价格保持一致，但这是一个新想法，是否真的会以这样的方式发挥作用尚未明确。” +

"Thanks." From New York, NPR's Barbara Mantel.  +

与其说是现在里面的东西，不如说是外面的东西——一张在伍尔沃斯商店前面的你正面的照片，我猜是在得克萨斯州或田纳西州的某个地方，还有……”“得克萨斯州休斯顿。” +


"In Houston, Texas? Is it *the Woolworth store* 后定 that has the *hardwood floor* still /and the parakeets 长尾鹦鹉 in the back /and that *sort of thing*?" +
在得克萨斯州休斯顿？是那家仍然铺着硬木地板、后面养着长尾小鹦鹉之类的伍尔沃斯商店吗？ +

这是一座两层楼的楼房，里面有自动扶梯，每隔几分钟就会发出轻微的乒乓声 +

And it takes up a whole city block." "But, why a cover photo 封面照片 in front of Woolworth's?" "Well, that comes from the song 'Love at the Five and Dime （美国、加拿大的）十分硬币，十分钱,' which was a song that Cathy Mattea also cut this year /and had my first, you know, top five country hit 风行一时的流行歌曲（或唱片） with.  +

它占据了整个街区。 +
但是，为什么要在伍尔沃斯的门前放一张封面照片呢？  +
嗯，这首歌来自歌曲 Love at the Five and Dme，这首歌也是凯西·马特亚今年演唱的，你知道，这首歌是我在五大乡村歌曲中的第一首热门歌曲 +

And it deals with the Woolworth store." "There is, on the cover, you are holding a book, and you can't really see.  +

And *any time* I have the opportunity to influence the young person to pick up a book and read it, I would try to do that."

"When you hear these lyrics 歌词;抒情的 (诗歌), when the words come to you, are you hearing the stanzas （诗的）节，段 as poetry or as music?" /你是把这些小节当作诗歌还是音乐？ +
