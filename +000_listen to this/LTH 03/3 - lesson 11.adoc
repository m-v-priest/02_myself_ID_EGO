Lesson11


Texas Air announced today that it will buy the troubled People Express Airlines for about a hundred and twenty-five million dollars.  +
The proposed deal would allow most People Express employees to keep their jobs, although the company will eventually lose its identity and become part of Texas Air.  +
Federal officials must approve the merger.  +
Texas Air is also trying to buy Eastern Airlines.  +
A rally on Wall Street today after six consecutive losing sessions, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day up nearly nine points, to close at seventeen sixty-seven point fifty-eight.  +
What's being called a "Freedom Flight" of seventy former Cuban Political prisoners landed in Miami today to an ecstatic reception by thousands of relatives and well-wishers.  +
The plane also carried forty-one relatives of former prisoners.  +
The flight culminated nearly two years of negotiations with the Castro regime.
Texas Air Corporation today announced that it has agreed to buy People Express Airlines for one hundred twenty-five million dollars in securities.  +
Texas Air already owns Continental Airlines and New York Air.  +
It is in the process of acquiring Eastern Airlines.  +
People Express, one of the first no-frills, low-fare air carriers, has been in financial trouble lately.  +
It was forced to shut down its subsidiary, Frontier Airlines.  +
Texas Air now says it will acquire Frontier's assets as part of its deal with People Express.  +
Joining us now from New York, NPR's business reporter Barbara Mantel.  +
"Barbara, it is said this is a very attractive low price, this one hundred twenty-five million dollars in securities.  +
Besides that, why does Texas Air want People Express?" "Well, Frank Lorenzo, who is Chairman of Texas Air, will get airplanes from People Express, which he might need.  +
He will get the lowest cost work-force in the industry at People Express.  +
He will get a new terminal at Newark, New Jersey that People Express is building.  +
He'll get flights to London, and he will get control over competition.  +
People Express competes heavily, especially in the northeast corridor, with Texas Air." "This issue of competition has been a sticking point before for the Department of Transportation when two airlines wanted to get together.  +
How will Texas Air get around it this time?" "Well, they might not, Texas Air wanted to acquire East ..., or wants to acquire, Eastern Airline, and the Department of Transportation said, 'No, not unless you sell more landing slots, more slots in the northeast corridor to Pan Am so that we'll have some competition there.' And Texas Air agreed to that just last week.  +
That may happen again here.  +
The Department of Transportation may require that Texas Air sell some slots or some gates to another airline to ensure that there is still competition in the northeast part of the marketplace.  +
But Texas Air has some leverage here with the Department of Transportation because People Express is a failing company.  +
And the Department of Transportation may feel, 'Well, we'll let them buy People Express and keep it running, rather than let it fail and lose all those jobs." "Mm hm.  +
Now, if the deal is approved by the Department of Transportation, what is it likely to mean for consumers? If there's less competition the fares could possibly go up." "Well, yes.  +
You would think that when you move from two competitors in a market to just one airliner that prices would just have to go up.  +
But I want you to keep in mind that unrestricted fares of the kind People Express offered, you know, wholesale unrestricted fares, were being eliminated and phased out anyway, because they were not profitable.  +
And the Department of Transportation theory here is that if you allow mergers to take place, or many mergers to take place, you might create more efficiencies and low costs, leading possibly to lower fares.  +
And also the Department of Transportation believes that there's a lot of potential competition in the marketplace.  +
Airlines can move planes around and buy gates, and so that if an airline in a particular market segment was making a lot of money and raising prices excessively, other airlines would move in and prices would be brought down through competition.  +
So that it's a nice theory, the theory of potential competition keeping
prices in line, but it's sort of a new idea and it's not clear that that's really the way it would work." "Thanks." From New York, NPR's Barbara Mantel.  +
"My audiences have been very devoted over the years throughout the country.  +
And they've expanded and grown and the country audience has been just as kind and as supportive as the folk audience has been." "I was thinking though, nonetheless, when I put on this album, 'The Last of the True Believers,' especially the title cut, that I heard more country there than I'd perhaps heard before." "Well, I guess it has ...  +
I've moved in that direction, mainly because I am playing with the band more.  +
My natural roots are there in country and hillbilly music.  +
And so I think that just comes out more when you put the band with it." "I want to ask you some questions, please, about this album, about the ...  +
not so much what's on the inside right now, but what's on the outside—a picture on the front of you in front of a Woolworth store, someplace, I guess, in Texas or Tennessee, and ..." "Houston, Texas." "In Houston, Texas? Is it the Woolworth store that has the hardwood floor still and the parakeets in the back and that sort of thing?" "Well, this one that we shot this in front of in Houston Texas is one of the largest ones in the country.  +
It's a two-storey and it's got the escalator that does a little pinging noise every couple of minutes.  +
And it takes up a whole city block." "But, why a cover photo in front of Woolworth's?" "Well, that comes from the song 'Love at the Five and Dime,' which was a song that Cathy Mattea also cut this year and had my first, you know, top five country hit with.  +
And it deals with the Woolworth store." "There is, on the cover, you are holding a book, and you can't really see.  +
...  +
What is the name of the book on the cover you're holding?" "In the Kindness of Strangers, the latest Tennessee Williams' biography." "And on the back is Larry McMurtrie's book about a cattle drive around the turn of the century, Lonesome Dove ." "He's my main prose hero." "Now, why? Why would you do that? Why would you pose with a book?" "Well, I have, my audience consists of a lot of young people between the ages of, maybe you know, fourteen and twenty-five.  +
And I read a lot, and I also write short stories and have written a novel.  +
And I just feel like young people are missing out because they don't read books.  +
And any time I have the opportunity to influence the young person to pick up a book and read it, I would try to do that." "When you hear these lyrics, when the words come to you, are you hearing the stanzas as poetry or as music?" "Well, I'm hearing them as music.  +
Lyrics usually come to me, and songs come to me as a total picture.  +
And the music and the lyrics come at the same time.  +
Sometimes
they shoot me straight up in bed, you know, in the middle of the night.  +
The Wing and the Wheel' is a very special song to me.  +
It's probably my favorite song that I've ever written.  +
And that song was inspired at the Vancouver Folk Festival by two people who are from Managua, Nicaragua.  +
They have a duo call Duo Guar Buranco.  +
And just about four o'clock in the morning, I was sitting in my hotel room and listening to them sing in the room next door, and looking out the window at this little fingernail moon hanging out over the Vancouver Bay, and that song just came flowing, you know, and was inspired by those two people." "Now, that sounds easy." "Well, it IS easy.  +
If you listen to yourself and you listen to the inspiration that's bringing on that particular song, it's easy.  +
It's just a matter of getting up and writing it down." Nancy Griffith, talking with us in WPLN in Nashville.  +
She is continuing her national tour with the Everly Brothers.  +
Her latest album is called "The Last of the True Believers."


德克萨斯航空今天宣布将以约 1.25 亿美元收购陷入困境的人民快捷航空。拟议的交易将使大多数 People Express 员工保住工作，尽管该公司最终将失去其身份并成为德克萨斯航空的一部分。联邦官员必须批准合并。德克萨斯航空还试图收购东方航空。华尔街在连续六个交易日下跌后今日反弹，道琼斯工业平均指数当天收盘上涨近九点，收于十七六十七点五十八分。七十名前古巴政治犯组成的所谓“自由航班”今天抵达迈阿密，受到数千名亲属和祝福者的热烈欢迎。这架飞机还载有四十一名前囚犯的亲属。这次逃亡使与卡斯特罗政权近两年的谈判达到了高潮。德克萨斯航空公司 (Texas Air Corporation) 今天宣布，它已同意以 1.25 亿美元的证券收购人民快运航空公司 (People Express Airlines)。德克萨斯航空已经拥有大陆航空和纽约航空。它正在收购东方航空公司。人民快运是最早的廉价廉价航空公司之一，最近陷入了财务困境。它被迫关闭其子公司边疆航空。德克萨斯航空现在表示，作为与 People Express 交易的一部分，它将收购 Frontier 的资产。 NPR 商业记者芭芭拉·曼特尔 (Barbara Mantel) 现在从纽约加入我们。 “芭芭拉，据说这是一个非常有吸引力的低价，这一亿两千五百万美元的证券。除此之外，德克萨斯航空为什么要找人民快运？” “嗯，德克萨斯航空公司董事长弗兰克·洛伦佐将从人民快运公司获得他可能需要的飞机。 他将在 People Express 获得业内成本最低的劳动力。他将获得人民快运公司正在新泽西州纽瓦克建造的一个新航站楼。他将获得飞往伦敦的航班，他将掌控竞争。 People Express 与德克萨斯航空的竞争非常激烈，尤其是在东北走廊。” “当两家航空公司想要合并时，这种竞争问题一直是交通部的一个症结所在。德州航空这次将如何解决这个问题？”“好吧，他们可能不会，德州航空想要收购东方航空......，或者想要收购东方航空，而交通部说，‘不，除非你卖得更多起落架，在通往泛美航空的东北走廊上有更多起落架，以便我们在那里进行一些竞争。德克萨斯航空上周同意了这一点。这里可能会再次发生这种情况。交通部可能会要求德克萨斯航空将一些时刻或一些登机口出售给另一家航空公司，以确保东北部市场仍然存在竞争。但德克萨斯航空在运输部方面拥有一定的影响力，因为人民快递是一家失败的公司。交通部可能会觉得，‘好吧，我们会让他们购买人民快车并让它继续运行，而不是让它失败并失去所有这些工作。’”现在，如果该交易获得交通部批准，对消费者来说可能意味着什么？如果竞争减少，票价可能会上涨。” “嗯，是的。您可能会认为，当您从市场上的两个竞争对手转向只有一架客机时，价格只会上涨。 但我希望你们记住，人民快运提供的那种无限制票价，你知道，批发无限制票价，无论如何都会被取消和逐步淘汰，因为它们不盈利。交通部的理论是，如果允许进行合并或进行多次合并，则可能会提高效率并降低成本，从而可能降低票价。交通部还认为市场上存在很多潜在的竞争。航空公司可以调动飞机并购买登机口，因此，如果某家航空公司在特定细分市场赚了很多钱并过度提高价格，其他航空公司就会进入，并通过竞争压低价格。所以这是一个很好的理论，潜在竞争使价格保持一致的理论，但它是一个新想法，目前还不清楚它是否真的会起作用。” “谢谢。” 来自纽约，NPR 的芭芭拉·曼特尔 (Barbara Mantel)。 “多年来，全国各地的观众一直非常忠诚。他们已经扩大和成长，乡村听众和民间听众一样友善和支持。”“尽管如此，当我推出这张专辑《最后的真正信徒》时，我在想， ’尤其是标题剪辑，我在那里听到的乡村音乐比我以前听到的要多。”“嗯，我想它已经……我已经朝这个方向前进，主要是因为我更多地与乐队一起演奏。我天生就植根于乡村音乐和乡巴佬音乐。所以我认为当你把乐队放在一起时，这种感觉就会更加明显。” “我想问你一些问题，关于这张专辑，关于......与其说是现在里面的东西，不如说是外面的东西——一张在伍尔沃斯商店前面的你正面的照片，我猜是在得克萨斯州或田纳西州的某个地方，还有……”“得克萨斯州休斯顿。”“在得克萨斯州休斯顿？是那家仍然铺着硬木地板、后面养着长尾小鹦鹉之类的伍尔沃斯商店吗？”“嗯，我们在得克萨斯州休斯顿前面拍摄的这家商店是全国最大的商店之一。这是一栋两层楼的建筑，自动扶梯每隔几分钟就会发出一点叮当声。它占据了整个街区。” “但是，为什么封面照片要在 Woolworth's 前面呢？” “嗯，那是来自歌曲《Love at the Five and Dime》，这首歌也是 Cathy Mattea 也剪过的。那一年，我第一次进入了前五名的国家。它与伍尔沃斯商店有关。” “在封面上，你拿着一本书，但你实际上看不到。 ......你手里拿着的封面上的书叫什么名字？”“《陌生人的善意》，田纳西·威廉姆斯最新的传记。”“背面是拉里·麦克默特里的书，讲述了在 2010 年 10 月 19 日赶牛的故事。世纪，孤独的鸽子。” “他是我的主要散文英雄。” “现在，为什么？为什么要这么做？你为什么要拿着一本书摆姿势？” “嗯，我有，我的观众包括很多年龄在，也许你知道，十四岁到二十五岁之间的年轻人。我读书很多，也写短篇小说，还写过长篇小说。我只是觉得年轻人因为不读书而错过了机会。每当我有机会影响年轻人拿起一本书并阅读时，我都会尝试这样做。” “当你听到这些歌词时，当这些词出现在你脑海中时，你是把这些诗节当作诗歌还是音乐来听？” “嗯，我把它们当作音乐来听。我通常会想到歌词，而我通常会以整体画面的形式想到歌曲。音乐和歌词是同时出现的。有时他们会在半夜把我直接射到床上。 《The Wing and the Wheel》对我来说是一首非常特别的歌曲。这可能是我写过的最喜欢的歌曲。这首歌的灵感来自于温哥华民谣节，来自尼加拉瓜马那瓜的两个人。他们有一个叫 Duo Guar Buranco 的二人组。凌晨四点左右，我坐在酒店房间里，听着他们在隔壁房间唱歌，看着窗外悬在温哥华湾上空的小指甲月亮，那首歌就像你知道，我的灵感源源不断，并且受到了这两个人的启发。” “现在，这听起来很容易。” “嗯，这很容易。如果你倾听自己的声音，倾听那首特定歌曲的灵感，那就很容易了。这只是站起来写下来的问题。”南希·格里菲斯 (Nancy Griffith) 在纳什维尔的 WPLN 中与我们交谈。她正在继续与 Everly Brothers 一起进行全国巡演。她的最新专辑名为“The Last of the True Believers”。”
