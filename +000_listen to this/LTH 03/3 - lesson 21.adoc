A committee of scientists is calling on President Reagan to launch a billion-dollar information campaign to keep the AIDS epidemic from spreading to catastrophic proportions.
一个科学家委员会呼吁里根总统发起一项耗资十亿美元的宣传活动，以防止艾滋病流行蔓延至灾难性的程度。

The National Academy of Sciences convened the panel which says education efforts must be used because effective treatment and a vaccine appear to be years away.
美国国家科学院召集了一个小组，表示必须采取教育措施，因为有效的治疗方法和疫苗似乎还需要数年时间。

The report urges the establishment of a new federal office to head a nationwide education effort as well as an advisory commission for research and education.
该报告敦促建立一个新的联邦办公室来领导全国教育工作以及一个研究和教育咨询委员会。

The scientists say the White House should lead an action campaign the way it has led a new crackdown on illegal drugs.
科学家们表示，白宫应该像领导新一轮打击非法毒品的方式一样领导一场行动。

Jam Demjanjuk is in jail in Israel after being extradited and maintains his is a case of mistaken identity.

The BBC’s Paul Reynolds has more in this report from Jerusalem.
BBC 的保罗·雷诺兹在这篇来自耶路撒冷的报道中提供了更多信息。

"The indictment charges Demjanjuk with crimes against the Jewish people, against humanity, and with war crimes.
“起诉书指控德米扬鲁克犯有反犹太人罪、反人类罪和战争罪。

He’s said to have been responsible for herding Jews into the gas chambers and often stabbed or whipped flesh from them as they went in.
据说他负责将犹太人赶进毒气室，并经常在他们进入毒气室时刺伤或鞭打他们的肉。

The state of Israel will be calling eight former Treblinka inmates and an SS guard who will identify Demjanjuk as "Ivan the Terrible".
以色列国将传唤八名前特雷布林卡囚犯和一名党卫军警卫，他们将指称德米扬鲁克为“伊凡雷帝”。

Demjanjuk’s defense, though, will be quite simple.
不过，德米扬鲁克的防守非常简单。

He’ll say he’s somebody else.
他会说他是别人。

His American lawyer has been seeking out other camp survivors who can’t support the identification, and the whole trial will resolve around this question.

Demjanjuk’s trial is expected to begin at the end of the year and could take as long as six months.
德米扬鲁克的审判预计将于今年年底开始，可能需要长达六个月的时间。

Today, a panel of the nation’s leading scientists and physicians issued a major review of the government’s response to the AIDS epidemic.
今天，一个由美国顶尖科学家和医生组成的小组对政府应对艾滋病流行的措施进行了重大审查。

The panel was convened by the National Academy of Sciences.
该小组由美国国家科学院召集。

The scientists called for massive increases in funding for AIDS research and education.
科学家们呼吁大幅增加艾滋病研究和教育的资金。

They also urged President Reagan to lead the fight against disease.
他们还敦促里根总统领导抗击疾病的斗争。

NPR’s Richard Harris has the story: Six months ago, the Academy decided that AIDS was so serious a problem that they needed to review that nation’s fight against the disease.
NPR 的理查德·哈里斯 (Richard Harris) 讲述了这样一个故事：六个月前，学院认为艾滋病是一个非常严重的问题，因此他们需要审查该国与该疾病的斗争。

They chose Nobel laureate, David Baltimore to head their panel and enlisted the cooperative of leading health researchers.
他们选择诺贝尔奖获得者大卫·巴尔的摩来领导他们的小组，并招募了领先的健康研究人员合作。

The Academy has no control over the federal budget, but they have considerable prestige.
该学院无法控制联邦预算，但拥有相当高的威望。

And they banked on that prestige today when they called for a billion dollars a year for AIDS research by 1990.
今天，他们依靠这种声望呼吁到 1990 年每年为艾滋病研究提供 10 亿美元。

That translates into a four-fold increase in funding over the next three years.
这意味着未来三年的资金将增加四倍。

Today, Chairman David Baltimore said the country should spend another billion dollars a year for AIDS education.
今天，主席戴维·巴尔的摩表示，国家每年应该再花费十亿美元用于艾滋病教育。

"We are saying that a program that is at all responsive to the needs of the situation will cost billion dollars.
“我们是说，一个完全满足形势需要的计划将花费数十亿美元。

And we are not specifying where that billion dollars should come from because it’s made up of whole lot of little pieces," pieces that should be shared by local government and private industry.
我们没有具体说明这十亿美元应该从哪里来，因为它是由很多小块组成的，”这些小块应该由地方政府和私营企业共享。

The panel said education efforts so far have been, as they put it, "woefully inadequate", inadequate because officials have spent 1/8 as much money as they should have, and inadequate, they said, because health officials have been too squeamish to talk about sex or to promote the use of condoms.
该小组表示，正如他们所说，到目前为止，教育工作“严重不足”，不足是因为官员们只花了应有资金的 1/8，而且不足是因为卫生官员过于拘谨，谈论性或提倡使用安全套。

Baltimore said these attitudes must change now, because the AIDS epidemic is at critical point.
巴尔的摩表示，这些态度现在必须改变，因为艾滋病流行正处于关键时刻。

"The virus has now spread widely as far as we know outside of the high-risk groups.
“据我们所知，该病毒现在已在高危人群之外广泛传播。

We are afraid, in fact there is perfectly good evidence, that such spread is possible, and are calling for people to take precautions in situations where they may not have though they were at risk." Baltimore said that anyone who has sexual relations with more than one partner should take precautions against exposure to the AIDS virus.
事实上，我们担心，有充分的证据表明这种传播是可能的，并呼吁人们在可能没有接触过的情况下采取预防措施，尽管他们面临危险。”巴尔的摩说，任何与更多人发生性关系的人不止一个伴侣应该采取预防措施，避免接触艾滋病病毒。

The panel said condoms are one way to avoid infection.
该小组表示，避孕套是避免感染的一种方法。

The report does not predict that AIDS will spread rapidly by heterosexual contact in the next five years, but recurring theme in the report is that now is the time to prevent the epidemic from becoming even worse.
报告并未预测艾滋病将在未来五年内通过异性接触迅速传播，但报告中反复出现的主题是，现在是防止疫情进一步恶化的时候了。

Already more than 25,000 Americans have been diagnosed with AIDS.
已有超过 25,000 名美国人被诊断出患有艾滋病。

Baltimore called on President Reagan to declare war on AIDS the way he declared war on illegal drugs.
巴尔的摩呼吁里根总统像向非法毒品宣战一样向艾滋病宣战。

"We are talking about President taking that form of leadership, and it’s clear that when the President speaks out on an issue in such forceful terms, that the whole nation sees it in the different way." The National Academy report, like the Surgeon General’s recommendations last week, gives the president a convenient way to take on AIDS as an issue.
“我们正在谈论总统采取这种形式的领导，很明显，当总统以如此强有力的措辞就一个问题发表讲话时，整个国家都会以不同的方式看待它。”国家科学院的报告，就像卫生局局长上周的建议一样，为总统提供了一种便捷的方式来解决艾滋病问题。

Both reports stress that AIDS is not just a disease that can infect gay men and drug abusers.
这两份报告都强调，艾滋病不仅仅是一种可以感染男同性恋者和吸毒者的疾病。

They say now AIDS is a sexually transmitted disease that can affect anyone.
他们说现在艾滋病是一种性传播疾病，可以影响任何人。

In Washington this is Richard Harris.
我是华盛顿的理查德·哈里斯。

Hard Choices is a low-budget film that has been well received by many critics this past summer, but that does not make it a runaway hit.
《艰难的选择》是一部低成本电影，去年夏天受到了许多影评人的好评，但这并不意味着它会大受欢迎。

In fact, its thirty-four-year-old producer, Robert Michaelson, has been found at the film’s openings passing out fliers in front of the theaters.
事实上，人们发现该片 34 岁的制片人罗伯特·迈克尔森 (Robert Michaelson) 在影片开场时在影院前散发传单。

Critic Bob Mondello says he shouldn’t have to do that.
评论家鲍勃蒙德罗说他不应该这样做。

In a perfect world, little movies about Tennessee kids who get caught on the wrong side of the law would get the publicity they need, and film companies would stop hyping pre-sold blockbusters about psychotic cops.
在一个完美的世界里，关于田纳西州孩子触犯法律的小电影将得到他们所需要的宣传，电影公司也将停止大肆宣传关于精神病警察的预售大片。

This is not, however, a perfect world.
然而，这并不是一个完美的世界。

And I don’t want to imply that Hard Choices is a perfect movie, either.
我也不想暗示《艰难的选择》是一部完美的电影。

But it’s so much more involving and suspenseful and just plain interesting than most of the junk Hollywood putsout that it makes you want to do hand flips.
但它比大多数好莱坞的垃圾片更引人入胜、更有悬念，而且更有趣，让你想翻手。

It’s the story of a rural sixteen-year-old, named Bobby, played winningly by new comer Gary McCleary, who goes along for the ride one evening with his hell-raising older brothers.
这是一个十六岁乡村男孩鲍比的故事，由新人加里·麦克利里出色地饰演，一天晚上，鲍比和他那些调皮捣蛋的哥哥们一起去兜风。

When they decide to rob a local pharmacy, Bobby stays out in the truck, and that’s where he is when one of his brothers panics and kills a policeman.
当他们决定抢劫当地一家药店时，鲍比呆在卡车里，当他的一个兄弟惊慌失措并杀死了一名警察时，他就在卡车里。

Bobby’s soon on the run with his brothers, and soon in jail.
鲍比很快就和他的兄弟们一起逃亡，并很快入狱。

Now, up to this point, this could be any of a dozen rebel-rousing teen movies, but Bobby’s not your average teen protagonist.
现在，到目前为止，这可能是十几部激发叛逆的青少年电影中的任何一部，但鲍比并不是普通的青少年主角。

He’s a sweet kid, so innocent in fact, that he can’t even lie to his mother, who’s a bit innocent herself.
他是个可爱的孩子，事实上很天真，他甚至不能对他的母亲撒谎，而他的母亲本身也有点天真。

"Bobby, how come everybody says you boys took drugs? I know you wasn’t sick." "Cause it’s true.
“鲍比，为什么每个人都说你们这些男孩吸毒了？我知道你们没有生病。” “因为这是真的。

We did." Now, talking about the innocence of a kid who takes drugs may seem a little odd, but what made Hard Choices such a compelling movie is that it doesn’t settle for easy answers.
我们做到了。”现在，谈论一个吸毒孩子的纯真似乎有点奇怪，但《艰难的选择》之所以成为一部如此引人注目的电影，是因为它不满足于简单的答案。

Having Bobby sit in jail is clearly not in anyone’s best interests.
让鲍比入狱显然不符合任何人的最佳利益。

So when his case is taken by Laura, a young social worker played by Margaret Clenk, you’re mightily relieved.
因此，当玛格丽特·克伦克（Margaret Clenk）饰演的年轻社会工作者劳拉（Laura）接手他的案子时，你会松一口气。

Unfortunately this kid isn’t very lucky in the folks who take a shine to him.
不幸的是，这个孩子在那些喜欢他的人中并不是很幸运。

Clenk, who’s probably best known as Edwena Louis in the soap opera "One Life to Live", makes Laura a tired activist who’s so won over by Bobby’s lopsided grin and optimism, she’s soon doing something supremely dumb: pointing pistol at the Sheriff.
克伦克最出名的角色可能是肥皂剧《一生一世》中的埃德温娜·路易斯，她让劳拉成为一名疲惫的活动家，她被鲍比歪着的笑容和乐观主义所征服，很快她就做出了一件极其愚蠢的事情：用手枪指着警长。

Woman: Do you have a gun, Bobby? Bobby: It’s on the wall.
女人：鲍比，你有枪吗？鲍比：在墙上。

Woman: Go get it.
女：去拿吧。

Bobby: Wait a minute.
鲍比：等一下。

Woman: Go get the gun! Man: Bobby, don’t do it.
女：去拿枪！男人：鲍比，别这么做。

You’re making a big mistake.
你犯了一个大错误。

I’m going to have to come and get you.
我得过来接你。

Woman: Don’t you want to be free? Since he’s being tried as an adult, that is a hard choice.
女：你不想自由吗？由于他是作为成年人接受审判，这是一个艰难的选择。

Now, this may remind you of a real life story recently in which a lawyer in Tennessee fell in love with her client and helped him escape, or it may just generally remind you of real life.
现在，这可能会让您想起最近的一个现实生活故事，田纳西州的一位律师爱上了她的委托人并帮助他逃跑，或者它可能只是一般地让您想起了现实生活。

One of the best things about Hard Choices is that everything in it seems so utterly natural.
《艰难选择》最好的事情之一就是其中的一切看起来都那么自然。

The supporting cast, for instance, which includes Secaucus Seven director, John Sales.
例如，配角包括《锡考克斯七号》导演约翰·赛尔斯。

It’s generally terrific, which you could also say about Rick King’s casually suspenseful direction.
总的来说，它非常棒，你也可以说瑞克·金随意悬疑的导演。

He keeps you just a little off balance, which is wonderful.
他让你有点失去平衡，这太棒了。

Unfortunately, his movie seems to have its Hollywood’s sponsors a little off balance, too.
不幸的是，他的电影似乎也让好莱坞的赞助商有点失衡。

Despite reviews that called the sleeper of the summer, Lorimar Pictures can’t seem to get handle on how to sell it.
尽管有评论称其为夏季卧铺片，但洛里玛影业似乎不知道如何出售它。

And frankly, with major media advertising costing what it does, if a film can’t be described in a phrase of six words or less, like "crime is the disease, cobra’s the cure".
坦率地说，由于主要媒体的广告成本很高，如果一部电影不能用六个字或更少的短语来描述，比如“犯罪是疾病，眼镜蛇是治疗方法”。

Tuisel Town often has to throw up its hands.
图伊塞尔镇常常不得不举手投降。

The thing is that Hard Choices is just what Hollywood needs right now.
问题是《艰难的选择》正是好莱坞现在所需要的。

With idiotic fantasies about talking ducks costing as much as $40,000,000, this is practically the definitive small movie, made for what most Hollywood epics spend on catering.
这部关于会说话的鸭子的愚蠢幻想成本高达 40,000,000 美元，这实际上是一部权威的小电影，是为大多数好莱坞史诗片的餐饮费用而制作的。

I don’t want to oversell it.
我不想过度推销它。

It’s certainly not perfect.
这当然不完美。

But it sure makes the adrenaline flow.
但它确实会让肾上腺素激增。

And when you take its budget into account, it’s nothing less than amazing.
当你考虑到它的预算时，你会发现它简直令人惊叹。

If the studios can’t figure out how to make a picture like this work, they deserve disasters like Howard the Duck .
如果制片厂不知道如何制作出这样的作品，他们就应该遭遇像《霍华德鸭子》那样的灾难。

The problem is, if you want to see it, you may have to search for Hard Choices because it’s not being released all at once.
问题是，如果你想看它，你可能必须搜索“艰难的选择”，因为它不会立即全部发布。

There are only a few prints.
只有几张印刷品。

But it’s worth asking your local theater owner to book.
但值得请当地剧院老板预订。

With summer hold-overs as the alternative, it makes your September movie going an easy choice.
有了夏季保留作为替代方案，它使您的九月电影成为一个简单的选择。

Hard Choices opens tomorrow in Chicago and Minneapolis.
《艰难选择》明天将在芝加哥和明尼阿波利斯开幕。

Next weekend in San Francisco and at the Boston Film Festival.
下周末在旧金山和波士顿电影节。

Bob Mondello was the film critic for "All Things Considered".
鲍勃·蒙德罗是《考虑到一切》的影评人。
