Iran's official news agency said today former US National Security Advisor Robert McFarlane and four other Americans were jailed in Tehran for five days recently after they arrived on a secret diplomatic mission.  + 
 The report quoted the speaker of Iran's parliament as saying President Reagan sent the group to Tehran posing as aircraft crewmen.  + 
 He said they carried with them a Bible signed by the President and a cake.  + 

He said the presents were designed to improve relations between the two countries.  + 
 Neither the Reagan Administration nor McFarlane had any comment on the report.  + 
 There were published reports in the Middle East that hostage David Jacobsen was freed as a result of negotiations between the United States and Iran.  + 
 Asked about that today, Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite said that he didn't want to comment on the political dynamics.  + 
 But Waite said he may know within the next twenty-four hours from his contacts if he will be returning to Beirut to negotiate the release of more hostages.  + 
 Jacobsen was reunited with his family today, but again said his joy could not be complete until the other hostages are freed.  + 
 He appeared on the hospital balcony with his family and talked with reporters.  + 
 Hospital director Colonel Charles Moffitt says Jacobsen needs to communicate with people now.  + 
 "He likes to talk, whether that be to a group of press or to individual physicians.  + 
 Once you get him started on a subject, he wants to talk because he hasn't been able to do that.  + 
" Moffitt says Jacobsen is in good health and will not need followup medical care.  + 
 A low to moderate turnout is reported across the nation so far on this election day.  + 
 Voters are choosing members of the one hundredth Congress, thirty-four senators and all four hundred thirty-five members of the US House of Representatives.  + 
 One of the big questions is which Party will control the Senate after today's voting.  + 
 President Reagan's former National Security Advisor, Robert McFarlane, and four other Americans may have visited Tehran recently on a secret diplomatic mission.  + 
 Today, on the seventh anniversary of the seizure of the US embassy in Tehran, Iran Speaker of the Parliament said the visiting Americans were held for five days before being expelled from the country.  + 
 NPR was unable to reach Mr.  + 
 McFarlane today for comment and the White House says that it can neither confirm nor deny the story.  + 
 NPR's Elizabeth Colton reports.  +


伊朗官方通讯社今天称，前美国国家安全顾问罗伯特·麦克法兰, 和其他四名美国人, 最近抵达德黑兰执行秘密外交任务后, 被监禁五天。报道援引伊朗议会议长的话说，里根总统派这群人, 冒充机组人员前往德黑兰。他说他们随身携带了一本由总统签名的圣经, 和一个蛋糕。他说，这些礼物旨在改善两国关系。里根政府和麦克法兰, 都没有对该报告发表任何评论。中东有报道称，人质大卫·雅各布森, 因美国和伊朗之间的谈判而获释。今天被问及此事时，英国圣公会特使特里·韦特表示，他不想对政治动态发表评论。但韦特表示，他可能会在接下来的二十四小时内, 从联系人那里得知, 他是否会返回贝鲁特，就释放更多人质进行谈判。雅各布森今天与家人团聚，但他再次表示，在其他人质获释之前，他的喜悦之情无法完全表达。他与家人一起出现在医院阳台上, 并接受记者采访。医院院长查尔斯·莫菲特上校表示，雅各布森现在需要与人们沟通。 “他喜欢说话，无论是对一群媒体, 还是对个别医生。一旦你让他开始谈论某个话题，他就会想说话，因为他一直无法做到这一点。”莫菲特说雅各布森身体状况良好，不需要后续医疗护理。据报道，本次选举日迄今为止，全国各地的投票率较低, 至中等。 选民正在选举第一百名国会议员、三十四名参议员, 和美国众议院全部四百三十五名议员。最大的问题之一是, 今天投票后, 哪个党将控制参议院。里根总统的前国家安全顾问罗伯特·麦克法兰, 和其他四名美国人, 最近可能访问了德黑兰, 执行秘密外交任务。今天，在美国驻德黑兰大使馆被占领七周年之际，伊朗议会议长表示，来访的美国人被拘留了五天，然后被驱逐出境。 NPR 今天无法联系到麦克法兰请其置评，白宫表示既不能证实, 也不能否认这个故事。 NPR 的伊丽莎白·科尔顿报道。

Today in Tehran, Speaker of the Parliament, Hashami Rafsanjani took the occasion to tell a rally that President Reagan had recently sent personal envoys to Iran, calling for improvement of relations.  +

 In response to the American overtures, Rafsanjani announced that Iran will advise its friends in Lebanon, in other words the hostage takers, to free US and French hostages if Israel frees Lebanese prisoners, and if the American and French governments end their hostility to the revolutionary government of Iran.  + 
 Rafsanjani then reportedly described for the tens of thousands outside his parliament, the visit of the five American emissaries.  + 
 The Iranian said they flew in, posing as the flight crew of a plane bringing American military spare parts to Iran from Europe.  + 
 The US envoys reportedly carried Irish passports, now said to be
held by Iranian officials.  + 
 And one of the men called himself McFarlane.  + 
 And according to Rafsanjani, he looked exactly like President Reagan's former National Security Advisor.  + 
 Rafsanjani claimed that Iranian security officials also have a tape of telephone conversations between the American President and his envoys, The Iranian cleric, Rafsanjani, said the five men were confined to a hotel for five days and later deported after Ayatollah Khomeini advised Iranian officials not to meet them or receive their message.  + 
 Rafsanjani said the Americans had brought a Bible signed by President Reagan and a key-shaped cake which they said was the symbol of the hope of reopening US-Iran relations.  + 
 In Tehran today, at the ceremony marking the anniversary of the seizure of the American embassy, Parliamentary Speaker Rafsanjani described the visit by the American emissaries as a sign of Washington's helplessness.  + 
 The White House said it would neither confirm nor deny the reports, because according to the press office, there are certain matters pertaining to efforts to try to release the hostages, and comments might jeopardize them.  + 
 Robert McFarlane, who was also a frequent political commentator for NPR's morning edition, has been unavailable for comment.  + 
 I am Elizabeth Colton in Washington.  +

Over the last few years and around the country, the number of fundamentalist religious groups is said to be growing.  +

 Some are called "ultra-fundamentalist" groups.  + 
 The estimates varied greatly.  + 
 The number could be as high as two thousand.  + 
 These organizations have different purposes and beliefs, but usually have one thing in common—strong leadership, quite often one person.  + 
 Four years ago in October at a fundamentalist Christian commune in West Virginia, a young boy died after a paddling session that lasted for two hours.  + 
 The child was spanked by his parents.  + 
 He had hit another child and refused to say he was sorry.  + 
 We reported the story of that paddling—the story of the Stonegate Community in November of 1982.  + 
 Since that time, Stonegate leader has been tried and convicted, one of the first times a leader of a religious group has been held responsible for the actions of a member.  + 
 Also in that time the parents of the child have served jail terms, and now they have agreed to tell their story.  + 
 The Stonegate Commune was near Charleston, West Virginia, in the northeast corner of the state.  + 
 It's mostly farming country.  + 
 The Stonegate members lived outside of town in an old white Victorian house, overlooking the Shenandoah River, eight young families living and working together.  + 
 They did some farming, some construction work and for a time ran a restaurant in Charleston.  + 
 It was their intention to become less of a commune and more of a community, with the families living in separate houses on the property.  + 
 We went to Stonegate on a Sunday evening in November of 1982.  + 
 We were reluctantly welcomed.  + 
 Less than a month before, two Stonegate members had been indicted for involuntary manslaughter.  + 
 They were the parents of Joseph Green, who was two years old when he died.  + 
 On this night many of the Stonegate people were defensive, almost angry.  + 
 That was four years ago.  + 
 The parents, Stewart and Leslie Green, were convicted of involuntary manslaughter and both spent a year in jail.  + 
 First Stewart, then Leslie.  + 

Then in a separate legal action, the leader of the Stonegate commune, Dorothy McLellan was also indicted.  + 
 McLellan did not take part in the paddling but she was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy in the death of Joey Green.  + 
 Stewart Green, the father, testified against Dorothy McLellan.  + 
 Green now believes that his son died because of McLellan's teachings and influence.  + 
 He explained in court that the Stonegate members were taught that a paddling session should continue until the child apologizes.  + 
 Green also testified that a four-hour spanking of Dorothy McLellan's grandson, Danny, had occurred two weeks before Joey Green's death.  + 
 He also said the Stonegate members, when Joey died, joined in a pledge of secrecy: the circumstances would be covered up; the death would be called an accident.  + 
 They were afraid all the Stonegate children would be taken away.  + 
 Joey's parents at first agreed to this.  + 
 It was later that they spoke out against what they called then a conspiracy of silence.  + 
 Both Stewart and Leslie Green grew up and married within the Stonegate community.  + 
 Leslie was only fifteen when she came to the Stonegate.  + 
 They lived with several other teenagers in the home of Dorothy and John McLellan.  + 
 The McLellans had been taking in young people who were having trouble, usually with drugs.  + 
 They wanted to use their marriage as an example of Christian family life.  + 
 John McLellan worked for an accounting firm, traveling during the week, Dot McLellan staying at home, taking care of more and more teenagers.  + 
 The Greens are now living in their first real home together, an apartment in Baltimore.  + 
 Stewart left the Stonegate, and Leslie joined him as soon as she got out of jail.  + 
 The Greens have now agreed to talk about their lives at Stonegate and about the paddling of their son.  + 


在过去的几年里，在全国各地，原教旨主义宗教团体的数量据说正在增长。
其中一些被称为“极端原教旨主义”团体。
估计值差异很大。
这个数字可能高达两千。
这些组织有不同的目的和信仰，但通常有一个共同点——强大的领导力，通常是一个人。
四年前十月，在西弗吉尼亚州的一个原教旨主义基督徒社区，一名小男孩在持续了两个小时的划桨活动后死亡。
孩子被父母打了屁股。
他打了另一个孩子，却拒绝道歉。
我们报道了那次划船的故事——1982年11月石门社区的故事。
自那时起，Stonegate的领导人就被审判并定罪，这是宗教团体领导人首次被追究对其成员行为的责任。
在这段时间里，孩子的父母也入狱服刑，现在他们同意讲述他们的故事。
石门公社位于西弗吉尼亚州东北角的查尔斯顿附近。
这里主要是农业国家。
石门成员住在城外一座古老的维多利亚式白色房子里，俯瞰着谢南多厄河，八个年轻家庭一起生活和工作。
他们做了一些农活，一些建筑工作，并在查尔斯顿开了一家餐馆。
他们的意图是减少公社，增加社区，让家庭住在财产上单独的房子里。
1982年11月的一个星期天晚上，我们去了石门。
我们被不情愿地欢迎了。
不到一个月前，两名石门成员因过失杀人罪被起诉。
他们是约瑟夫·格林的父母，他去世时才两岁。
今晚，许多石门镇的人都很警惕，甚至有点愤怒。
那是四年前的事了。

父母斯图尔特·格林, 和莱斯利·格林, 被判犯有过失杀人罪，双双入狱一年。首先是斯图尔特，然后是莱斯利。随后，在另一项法律诉讼中，斯通盖特公社的领导人多萝西·麦克莱伦, 也被起诉。麦克莱伦没有参加划船活动，但她被判犯有过失杀人罪, 和串谋杀害乔伊·格林罪。父亲斯图尔特·格林出庭作证, 指控多萝西·麦克莱伦。格林现在相信他的儿子, 是因为麦克莱伦的教导和影响而死的。 他在法庭上解释说，石门成员被教导应该继续划船，直到孩子道歉为止。格林还作证说，在乔伊·格林去世前两周，多萝西·麦克莱伦的孙子丹尼, 被打了四个小时。他还说，当乔伊去世时，石门成员加入了保密承诺：情况将被掩盖；死亡将被称为意外事故。他们担心所有的石门孩子都会被带走。乔伊的父母起初同意了这一点。后来，他们公开反对他们所谓的“沉默阴谋”。斯图尔特和莱斯利·格林都是在斯通盖特社区长大, 并结婚的。莱斯利来到石门时, 才十五岁。他们与其他几名青少年, 住在多萝西·麦克莱伦和约翰·麦克莱伦的家里。麦克莱伦夫妇一直收留有问题的年轻人，通常是因为毒品。他们想用自己的婚姻作, 为基督徒家庭生活的典范。约翰·麦克莱伦 (John McLellan) 在一家会计师事务所工作，每周都在出差，多特·麦克莱伦 (Dot McLellan) 则呆在家里，照顾越来越多的青少年。绿党现在一起住在他们的第一个真正的家，位于巴尔的摩的一套公寓。斯图尔特离开了石门，莱斯利一出狱就加入了他。绿党现在同意谈论他们在斯通盖特的生活, 以及他们儿子的划船经历。
