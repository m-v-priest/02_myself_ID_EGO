Lesson8


Two years of sensitive negotiations paid off today as seventy former Cuban political prisoners arrived in the United States.  +

All of the prisoners had served least ten years in Cuban jails, and some had been in prison since Fidel Castro came to power in 1959.  +

The release was arranged in part by French underwater explorer, Jacques Cousteau, and a delegation of American Roman Catholic bishops.  +

President Reagan today unveiled plans for nine hundred million dollar plan to reduce drug abuse in the United States.  +

It includes half a billion dollars for stepping up drug enforcement along US borders, especially in the southwest.  +

The plan also calls for mandatory drug testing for some federal workers.  +

NPR's Brenda Wilson reports.  +

"As part of his national crusade against drugs, President Reagan signed an executive order today requiring federal workers in sensitive positions to undergo drug tests.  +

The order covers employees who have access to classified information, presidentially appointed officials, law enforcement officials, and any federal worker engaged in activities which affect public health and safety or national security.  +

But heads of government agencies may order additional workers to take the test.  +

Federal employees who are found to have continued to use illegal drugs after a second test will be automatically fired.  +

The overall rug testing program is expected to cost fifty-six million dollars, but administration officials could not get even a ballpark figure of how many workers may be included in the mandatory program.  +

I'm Brenda Wilson." Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres is in Washington for talks with US leaders, including President Reagan.  +

Earlier Peres met with Secretary of State George Shultz.  +

Afterwards, the two told reporters that the Soviet Union will have no role in Middle East peace talks, because it has no diplomatic ties with Israel and does not permit free emigration of Soviet Jews.  +

Israel's Prime Minister Shimon Peres is in Washington D.  +

C.  +

this week to confer with high-level US officials.  +

His visit follows his summit with Egyptian President Mubarak last week.  +

This afternoon, the Israeli leader and President Reagan met at the White House.  +

NPR's Elizabeth Colton reports.  +

Israel's Peres comes to Washington only weeks before he is scheduled to step down from the Prime Minister's post and exchange roles with the current Foreign Minister, Yitzhak Shamir.  +

This rotation was arranged two years ago as part of Israel's coalition
national unity government.  +

But what was expected to be little more than a farewell visit for Prime Minister Peres has now taken on a new importance because of Peres' recent achievements towards bringing peace between Israelis and Arabs.  +

At the White House this afternoon President Reagan said that the Middle East peace process was the major topic for discussion.  +

And he praised Prime Minister Peres' efforts in that direction.  +

"We noted favorable trends in the Middle East, not just the longing for peace by the Israeli and Arab peoples, but constructive actions taken by leaders in the region to breathe new life into the peace process.  +

No one has done more than Prime Minister Peres to that end.  +

His vision, his statesmanship, and his tenacity are greatly appreciated here." President Reagan said that other items on the agenda of his meeting with Prime Minister Peres were American economic aid to Israel, international terrorism, and Soviet Jewry.  +

The President assured the Israeli leader that the plight of Soviet Jewry will remain an important topic in all the talks between the US and the Soviets.  +

A chapbook arrived in the mail a while back from the Northeastern Ohio University's College of Medicine.  +

The chapbook, a small pamphlet of collected poetry, contains works by students, part of the school's "Human Values in Medicine" program.  +

NPR's Susan Stanberg leafed through the poems.  +

The selected works by finalists in the "William Carlos Williams Poetry Competition," named for America's great poet-physician, the New Jersey country doctor who used to scroll drafts of poems on pages of his prescription pads.  +

William Carlos Williams wrote short, sometimes, and to the quick.  +

This is just to say I have eaten the plums That were in the ice box, And which you were probably saving for breakfast.  +

Forgive me; they were delicious, So sweet and so cold.  +

"Let me read it again." And he did.  +

William Carlos Williams, who died in 1963, has been an inspiration to patients and physicians.  +

So, it's fitting that the Northeastern Ohio University's College of Medicine should name its poetry competition for him.  +

Now, at the beginning of its fifth year, the competition is open to all medical students in this country, but just one percent of them, a few hundred or so, entered the competition.  +

"I'm sure a lot more are closet poets and aren't willing yet to submit.  +

We hope they do." Martin Cohn, director of the Human Values in Medicine's program at the College of Medicine, says that students' poetry centers around several themes.  +

"I guess it falls into categories that all poets write about, including lovers and friends and sorrowful kinds of situations, but then there is also the experience that they're most intimate with, which is medical school itself, which is also a theme, and also relationships with patients." Poetry by ten medical students is presented in the chapbook, accompanied by
biographical notes on each of the poets.  +

Kurt Beal, at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, describes himself this way.  +

"I write to remember, to find, to uncover, to unfold.  +

I have learned that poetry is music.  +

And I write because I cannot sing." Martin Cohn has some samples of poems from the chapbook.  +

P.C.  +

Bowman of the Medical College of Virginia School of Medicine wrote "Cartographer about his Wife." When I watch you watching yourselves in the mirror, Undress not with caution but with care, Peeling the swimsuit from shoulders and breasts, Exposing the belly flat from its vortex to the ribs, Ordered as architecture.  +

The hip swell That breaks my geometer's heart.  +

It is a map of some impossible country, Whose turns widen to vistas and stations So sudden that I cannot breathe or comprehend How I have wandered there and kept my life.  +

"Wonderful poem." "Ya." "But he doesn't have to be a doctor to have written it." "No.  +

That's true." "Give us one that could only be written by a doctor." "OK.  +

There is a poem, another one on anatomy, that was written by Diane Roston, who, as the other poets, has a very interesting background.  +

She danced for a number of years in a regional company and also had taken courses in journalism.  +

And she writes of an experience with a cadaver, and the life of this cadaver.  +

And she ends the poem with the following verse.  +

Now student to anatomy.  +

Cleave and mark this slab Of thirty-one-year-old caucasian female flesh, Limbs, thorax, cranium, muscle by rigid muscle.  +

Disassemble this motorcycle victim's every part, As if so gray a matter never wore a flashing ruby dress.  +

"I notice there's so much of that in this poetry by the medical students, the reminders to themselves of humanity here.  +

It's not just arteries; it's not just anatomy.  +

There are humans." "That's right.  +

And we feel we're just trying to do our part to encourage them to remember.  +

Many students shuck off we arts and humanities when they enter medical school, and even if we can keep them involved, even if it's a thread of involvement, or vicarious involvement by reading, not necessarily writing—that's what we are trying to do." At the Northeastern Ohio University's College of Medicine, Martin Cohn says there's no evidence that the making of poetry produces better medicine, but he has to believe it helps the students understand themselves and their patients better.  +

And so the William Carlos Williams Poetry Competition continues.  +

I'm Susan Stanberg.
This is just to say I have eaten the plums That were in the ice box And which you were probably saving for breakfast.  +

Forgive me; they were delicious, So sweet and so cold.


两年的敏感谈判今天得到了回报，七十名前古巴政治犯抵达美国。所有囚犯都已在古巴监狱服刑至少十年，其中一些自菲德尔·卡斯特罗 1959 年上台以来一直在监狱中。此次释放的部分安排是由法国水下探险家雅克·库斯托和美国罗马天主教主教代表团组成的。里根总统今天公布了一项耗资九亿美元的计划，旨在减少美国的药物滥用。其中包括 5 亿美元用于加强美国边境地区的禁毒执法，特别是在西南部。该计划还要求对一些联邦工作人员进行强制药物检测。 NPR 的布伦达·威尔逊报道。 “作为全国反毒品运动的一部分，里根总统今天签署了一项行政命令，要求担任敏感职位的联邦工作人员接受药物测试。该命令涵盖有权接触机密信息的雇员、总统任命的官员、执法官员和任何联邦官员。”从事影响公共健康和安全或国家安全活动的工作人员。但政府机构负责人可以命令额外的工作人员接受测试。在第二次测试后发现继续使用非法药物的联邦雇员将被自动解雇。整个地毯测试计划预计将花费 5600 万美元，但政府官员甚至无法获得强制计划中可能包含多少工人的大概数字。我是布伦达·威尔逊。以色列总理西蒙·佩雷斯正在华盛顿与包括里根总统在内的美国领导人举行会谈。早些时候，佩雷斯会见了国务卿乔治·舒尔茨。 随后，两人对记者表示，苏联不会在中东和谈中扮演任何角色，因为它与以色列没有外交关系，也不允许苏联犹太人自由移民。以色列总理西蒙·佩雷斯本周在华盛顿特区与美国高级官员举行会议。他的访问是在上周与埃及总统穆巴拉克举行峰会之后进行的。今天下午，以色列领导人与里根总统在白宫会面。 NPR 的伊丽莎白·科尔顿报道。以色列佩雷斯抵达华盛顿仅几周，他就计划辞去总理职务并与现任外交部长伊扎克·沙米尔交换角色。这次轮换是两年前安排的，是以色列联合民族团结政府的一部分。但由于佩雷斯最近在实现以色列人和阿拉伯人之间的和平方面取得的成就，原本对佩雷斯总理的一次告别访问现在变得具有新的重要性。里根总统今天下午在白宫表示，中东和平进程是讨论的主要议题。他赞扬佩雷斯总理在这方面所做的努力。 “我们注意到中东的有利趋势，不仅是以色列和阿拉伯人民对和平的渴望，而且是该地区领导人为给和平进程注入新活力而采取的建设性行动。没有人比佩雷斯总理做得更多。”为此。他的远见、他的政治才能和他的坚韧在这里受到高度赞赏。”里根总统表示，他与佩雷斯总理会晤议程上的其他议题包括美国对以色列的经济援助、国际恐怖主义和苏联犹太人问题。 总统向以色列领导人保证，苏联犹太人的困境将仍然是美国和苏联之间所有谈判的一个重要话题。我是华盛顿的伊丽莎白·科尔顿。不久前，东北俄亥俄大学医学院寄来了一本小册子。这本小册子是一本诗集小册子，包含学生的作品，是学校“医学中的人类价值观”项目的一部分。 NPR 的苏珊·斯坦伯格翻阅了这些诗。 “威廉·卡洛斯·威廉姆斯诗歌比赛”决赛入围者的精选作品，该比赛以美国伟大的诗人兼医生、新泽西州乡村医生的名字命名，他过去常常在处方簿上滚动诗稿。威廉·卡洛斯·威廉姆斯有时写得简短而迅速。这只是说我已经吃掉了冰箱里的李子，而你可能会把它们留作早餐。对不起;它们很好吃，又甜又冷。 “让我再读一遍。”他做到了。威廉·卡洛斯·威廉姆斯 (William Carlos Williams) 于 1963 年去世，他一直激励着患者和医生。因此，东北俄亥俄大学医学院以他的名字命名诗歌比赛是很合适的。现在，在第五个年头开始时，这项比赛向全国所有医学生开放，但只有百分之一（大约几百人）参加了比赛。 “我确信还有更多的人是秘密诗人，但还不愿意屈服。我们希望他们这样做。”医学院人类医学价值项目主任马丁·科恩表示，学生的诗歌围绕几个主题。 “我想它属于所有诗人所写的类别，包括恋人、朋友和悲伤的情况，但也有他们最亲密的经历，那就是医学院本身，这也是一个主题，以及与患者的关系。”小册子中收录了十位医学生的诗歌，并附有每位诗人的传记。休斯顿德克萨斯大学健康科学中心的库尔特·比尔这样描述自己。 “我写作是为了记住、寻找、发现、展开。我知道诗歌就是音乐。我写作是因为我不会唱歌。”马丁·科恩（Martin Cohn）有这本小册子中的一些诗歌样本。个人电脑。弗吉尼亚医学院的鲍曼写了《关于他妻子的制图师》。当我看着你们在镜子里看着自己时，脱下衣服不是小心翼翼，而是小心翼翼，从肩膀和胸部剥下泳衣，从涡流到肋骨露出平坦的腹部，作为建筑而有序。臀部的肿胀让我的几何学家心碎。这是一张关于某个不可能的国家的地图，它的转弯扩大到远景和车站，如此突然，我无法呼吸或理解我如何徘徊在那里并维持我的生活。 “美妙的诗。” “是啊。” “但他不一定是一名医生才能写出这本书。” “不。确实如此。” “给我们一份只有医生才能写的。” “好吧。有一首诗，另一首是关于解剖学的，是黛安·罗斯顿写的，她和其他诗人一样，有一个非常有趣的背景。她在一家地区公司跳舞了很多年，也参加过舞蹈课程。新闻。她写了关于尸体的经历，以及这具尸体的生活。她用下面的诗句结束了这首诗。现在是解剖学的学生。 将这块三十一岁白人女性的肉体、四肢、胸部、颅骨、肌肉逐个僵硬的肌肉切开并标记。拆开这个摩托车受害者的每一个部分，仿佛如此灰色的物体从未穿着过闪亮的红宝石连衣裙。 “我注意到医学生的诗中有很多这样的内容，提醒自己这里的人性。这不仅仅是动脉；这不仅仅是解剖学。还有人类。” “没错。我们觉得我们只是尽力鼓励他们记住。许多学生在进入医学院时就抛弃了我们的艺术和人文学科，即使我们可以让他们参与进来，即使这是一条线索参与，或者通过阅读替代参与，不一定是写作——这就是我们正在努力做的。”东北俄亥俄大学医学院的马丁·科恩表示，没有证据表明诗歌创作可以带来更好的医学，但他必须相信这有助于学生更好地了解自己和患者。威廉·卡洛斯·威廉姆斯诗歌比赛继续进行。我是苏珊·斯坦伯格。这只是说我已经吃掉了冰箱里的李子，而你可能会把它们留作早餐。对不起;它们很好吃，又甜又冷。
