Lesson7


Both House and Senate negotiators today approved sweeping immigration legislation that could grant amnesty to millions of illegal aliens who entered the country before 1982. The bill, as worked out in five hours of closed-door negotiations, would establish a system of fines against employers who hire illegal immigrants. It would also make those who came to the US illegally but have established roots in this country eligible for amnesty. The Supreme Court today agreed to decide if Illinois can require minors wanting abortions to notify their parents or obtain judicial consent. The justices will review the decision striking down a 1983 law, which required some girls to wait twenty-four hours after telling their parents they wanted an abortion.
It was announced today that the winner of this year's Noble Peace Prize is Elie Wiesel. He has written twenty-five books on his experiences in a Nazi prison of war camp and on the Holocaust. And he's been a human rights activist for thirty years. NPR's Mike Shuster reports. "Wiesel was sleeping in his Manhattan apartment when he received the word at five o'clock this morning from the Nobel Committee in Oslo, Norway. Wiesel said he was flabbergasted at the news, and later at a press conference, he said he would dedicate his Prize to the survivors of the Holocaust and their children. "The honor is not mine alone. It belongs to all the survivors who have tried to do something with their pain, with their memory, with their silence, with their life." Wiesel, fifty-eight, is a native of Rumania. As a teenager, he and his family were sent to a Nazi death camp. He and two sisters survived; his mother, father, and younger sister did not. After the War, Wiesel went first to France, then to the United States. He is credited with the first use of the word 'Holocaust' to describe the Nazi extermination of the Jews." A House-Senate Conference Committee has agreed to an immigration reform bill. The measure, which had died in the final days of the last two Congresses, now looks as though it will become law. NPR's Cokie Roberts reports. One of the chief advocates of the immigration bill, New York Democrat Charles Schumer, says that this year immigration became a white hat issue, that the forces fighting against the measures finally had a force on the opposite side of equal rate public opinion. The opponents of immigration reform have always been many: Hispanics in Congress and in the country have opposed the part of the bill most lawmakers consider key—punishment for employers who knowingly hire illegals. The measure, passed at a conference today, would provide civil penalties and criminal penalties for those who repeatedly hire illegal aliens. Hispanics worry the employer sanctions would cause discrimination against anyone with an accent or Spanish name, whether legal or not. The new bill includes strong anti-discrimination language for employers who do refuse to hire any Hispanics while still allowing someone to hire a citizen before an alien. To appease Hispanics and others, the immigration bill includes amnesty for aliens who have been in this country for five years. Many border state representatives fought against the legalization provisions, saying that millions of people could eventually become citizens and bring their relatives to this country. All those people could bankrupt the state's social services, said the representatives, but the idea of deporting all of those people seemed impractical as well as inhumane to most members of Congress. And aliens who came to this country before 1982 will be able to apply for legalization. The other major controversial area of the immigration bill is the farm worker program. Agricultural interests wanted to be able to bring workers into this country to harvest crops without being subjected to employer sanctions, but the trade unions opposed this section of the bill. Finally, a compromise was reached where up to three hundred and fifty thousand farm workers could come into this country, but their rights would be protected and they would also be able to
apply for legalization if they met certain conditions. The elements of the final immigration package have been there all along, but this year, say the key lawmakers around this legislation, the Congress was ready to act on them. The combination of horror stories about people coming over the borders and editorials about congressional inability to act made members of Congress decide the time had come to enact immigration reform. But supporters of reform warn the end is not here yet. The conference report must still pass both houses of Congress, and a Senate filibuster is always a possibility. I'm Cokie Roberts at the Capitol. Many photography shops are quite busy this time of the year. People back from vacation are dropping off rolls of film and hoping for the best. But commentator Tom Baudet learned a long time ago he was better off not hoping. I've been told that I take lousy pictures. It's not that my shots aren't technically OK; it's just that my pictures seem to bring out the worst in people. I hope that's not a sign of something. I usually end up throwing half the pictures I take. It's not that they're deceiving. Not at all; they're just too honest. It's true what they say that a camera never lies, but you certainly can lie to a camera. We do it all the time; at least we exaggerate a little to a lens. The first thing you'll usually hear when you point a camera at someone is, "Wait, I'm not ready." Well, so you wait while they brush the crumbs off their chin, put out a cigarette, or throw an arm around the person next to them like they've been standing that way all day. Well, you get your picture, but it's blown all out of proportion. Everybody's having a little more fun than they really were and liking each other more than they actually do. We're all guilty of this one time or another. You're with your sweetheart travelling somewhere. You've been walking and complaining about the price of the room, the blister on your heel and the rude waitress at the cafe. But then, you stop somebody on the street, hand them your camera, and put on your very best having-a-wonderful-time smile. Well, ten years later you'll look at that picture in a scrapbook and remember what a great trip it was, whether it was or not. For it's natural thing to do: plant little seeds of contentment in our lives in case we doubt we ever had any. Well, it's good practice to take an opportunity to mug up to a camera. There never seems to be a camera around for the real special times: that make-up embrace after a long and dangerous discussion, the look on your face as you hold the phone and hear you got that promotion, the quiet ride home from the hospital after learning those suspicious lumps were benign and something to watch but not worry about. Those are the memories that should be preserved, to be remembered and relied upon when harder times take hold. Those times when a photographer like me will catch you at a party with a loneliness on your face that you didn't think would show or bitterness tugging at your lips during a conversation you didn't intend to be overheard. Well, we all slip up like this sometimes, and sooner or later we get caught with our guards down. I think that's why I end up with pictures like that, I like it when people leave their guards down. We all know our best sides, and it's nice to keep that face forward whenever we can. But I don't mind having pictures of the other sides. Either way
they all look just like people to me. Writer Tom Baudet. He lives in Homer, Alaska.



众议院和参议院谈判代表今天批准了全面的移民立法，该立法可以对 1982 年之前进入美国的数百万非法外国人给予特赦。该法案经过五个小时的闭门谈判，将建立一个针对雇主的罚款制度雇用非法移民。它还将使那些非法来到美国但在这个国家扎根的人有资格获得特赦。最高法院今天同意决定伊利诺伊州是否可以要求想要堕胎的未成年人通知其父母或获得司法同意。法官们将审查废除 1983 年一项法律的决定，该法律要求一些女孩在告诉父母她们想要堕胎后必须等待 24 小时。今天宣布，今年诺贝尔和平奖的获得者是埃利·维塞尔。他已经写了二十五本书，讲述他在纳粹战俘营和大屠杀中的经历。三十年来，他一直是一名人权活动家。 NPR 的迈克·舒斯特报道。 “今天早上五点，威塞尔正在曼哈顿的公寓里睡觉，他收到了来自挪威奥斯陆诺贝尔委员会的消息。威塞尔说，他对这个消息感到震惊，后来在新闻发布会上，他说他将致力于他把这个奖颁给了大屠杀的幸存者和他们的孩子。“这个荣誉不只是我一个人的。它属于所有试图用自己的痛苦、记忆、沉默和生命做点什么的幸存者。”58 岁的威塞尔是罗马尼亚人。青少年时期，他和他的家人被送往纳粹死亡集中营。他和两个姐妹幸存下来；他的母亲、父亲和妹妹却没有。战后，威塞尔先去了法国，然后去了美国。 他被认为是第一个使用“大屠杀”一词来描述纳粹对犹太人的灭绝的人。美国国家公共广播电台 (NPR) 的科基·罗伯茨 (Cokie Roberts) 报道，移民法案的主要倡导者之一、纽约州民主党人查尔斯·舒默 (Charles Schumer) 表示，今年移民问题已成为白帽问题，反对移民的力量将在两届国会上通过，现在看起来似乎将成为法律。移民改革的反对者一直有很多：国会和国内的拉美裔人都反对该法案中大多数立法者认为关键的部分——对故意雇用雇主的惩罚非法移民。今天在一次会议上通过的这项措施将对那些屡次雇用非法外国人的人处以民事处罚和刑事处罚。西班牙裔担心雇主制裁将导致对任何有口音或西班牙名字的人的歧视，无论是否合法。新法案对那些拒绝雇用任何拉美裔但仍然允许某人在雇用外国人之前雇用公民的雇主使用了强有力的反歧视语言。为了安抚西班牙裔和其他人，移民法案包括对在这个国家居住五年的外国人进行特赦。许多边境州代表反对合法化条款，称数百万人最终可以成为公民并将他们的亲属带到这个国家。代表们表示，所有这些人都可能使该州的社会服务破产，但驱逐所有这些人的想法对于大多数国会议员来说似乎不切实际，也不人道。 1982年之前来到这个国家的外国人将可以申请合法化。移民法案的另一个主要争议领域是农场工人计划。农业利益集团希望能够在不受雇主制裁的情况下让工人进入这个国家收割庄稼，但工会反对该法案的这一部分。最后达成妥协，允许多达三十五万名农场工人进入这个国家，但他们的权利将受到保护，如果他们满足一定的条件，他们也可以申请合法化。最终移民计划的要素一直存在，但今年，围绕这项立法的主要立法者表示，国会已准备好对这些要素采取行动。关于人们越过边境的恐怖故事和关于国会无力采取行动的社论相结合，使国会议员决定是时候实施移民改革了。但改革的支持者警告说，改革的终点还没有到来。会议报告仍须通过国会参众两院，而参议院阻挠议事的可能性始终存在。我是国会大厦的科基·罗伯茨。每年这个时候，很多摄影店都非常繁忙。度假归来的人们纷纷寄出一卷胶卷，期盼着能有最好的结果。但评论员汤姆·鲍德特很久以前就知道，他最好不要抱希望。有人告诉我我拍的照片很糟糕。并不是说我的投篮技术不行；而是我的投篮技术不行。只是我的照片似乎暴露了人们最坏的一面。我希望这不是某种迹象。我通常会扔掉一半的照片。这并不是说他们在欺骗。一点也不;他们太诚实了。 人们确实说相机永远不会说谎，但你当然可以对相机撒谎。我们一直这样做；至少我们对镜头夸大了一点。当您将相机对准某人时，您通常听到的第一句话是“等等，我还没准备好。”好吧，所以你等着他们掸掉下巴上的面包屑，熄灭一支香烟，或者用手臂搂住旁边的人，就像他们已经这样站了一整天一样。好吧，你得到了你的照片，但它被放大得不成比例。每个人都比实际更有趣，并且比实际更喜欢彼此。我们都曾经犯过这样或那样的罪。你和你的爱人一起去某个地方旅行。你一边走一边抱怨房间的价格、脚跟上的水泡以及咖啡馆里粗鲁的女服务员。但随后，你在街上拦住某人，把你的相机递给他们，然后露出你最开心的微笑。好吧，十年后，你会在剪贴簿上看到那张照片，并记得那是一次多么伟大的旅行，无论它是否是一次。因为这是很自然的事情：在我们的生活中种下小小的满足的种子，以防我们怀疑自己曾经拥有过什么。嗯，抓住机会对着镜头恶搞是个好习惯。真正的特殊时刻似乎从来没有摄像机在身边：在漫长而危险的讨论之后化妆的拥抱，当你拿着电话听到你得到晋升时脸上的表情，从医院回家的安静旅程在得知这些可疑肿块是良性的、值得关注但不必担心的事情后。这些是在困难时期应该被保留、被铭记和依赖的记忆。 那些时候，像我这样的摄影师会在聚会上捕捉到你脸上挂着你认为不会表现出来的孤独，或者在一场你不希望被偷听的谈话中痛苦地拉扯你的嘴唇。好吧，我们有时都会犯这样的错误，迟早我们会因为放松警惕而被抓住。我想这就是为什么我最终会拍出这样的照片，我喜欢人们放松警惕。我们都知道自己最好的一面，只要有可能，就能保持自己最好的一面，这很好。但我不介意有另一面的照片。不管怎样，对我来说，他们看起来都像人一样。作家汤姆·鲍德。他住在阿拉斯加荷马。
