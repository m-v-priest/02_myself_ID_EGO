The indictment does not specify (v.)具体说明；明确规定；详述；详列 his presence, but there’s no question about it, issuing responsibility to him, I mean, just to sum up the indictment, and I’ll read: "On the basis of all that has been set forth, the state commission confirms that Lieutenant Kurt Waldheim is a war criminal responsible for the war crimes described and assessed above." Throughout his campaign last spring for the Austrian Presidency, Waldheim maintained that he was only a supply officer and an interpreter in his unit in the Balkans. +
起诉书没有具体说明他的存在，但毫无疑问，向他发出责任，我的意思是，只是为了总结起诉书，我将读到：“根据所有已提出的内容，国家委员会确认库尔特·瓦尔德海姆中尉是一名战争罪犯，对上述和评估的战争罪行负有责任。”在去年春天竞选奥地利总统期间，瓦尔德海姆坚称自己只是巴尔干部队的一名补给官和一名翻译。



But yesterday through a spokesman, Waldheim admitted that he was connected with a unit that carried out a massacre in Yugoslavia in 1942. +
但昨天瓦尔德海姆通过发言人承认，他与1942年在南斯拉夫实施大屠杀的一支部队有关。

The spokesman did not address the allegations in the indictment made public today. +
发言人没有回应今天公布的起诉书中的指控。

The Washington Post reported today that the Yugoslav and Soviet governments may have used the indictment and the investigative file it was based on to blackmail Waldheim into becoming a communist agent. +
《华盛顿邮报》今天报道称，南斯拉夫和苏联政府可能利用起诉书及其所依据的调查档案来勒索瓦尔德海姆，使其成为一名共产主义特工。

The Post quotes former Yugoslav intelligence and government officials as saying they were involved in an effort to blackmail Waldheim in 1948. +
《华盛顿邮报》援引前南斯拉夫情报和政府官员的话说，他们参与了 1948 年勒索瓦尔德海姆的活动。

One former official, according to the Post , says that Moscow informed the Yugoslav government in 1948 that Waldheim had been recruited. +
据《华盛顿邮报》报道，一名前官员称，莫斯科于 1948 年通知南斯拉夫政府，瓦尔德海姆已被招募。

The Post report also suggests that the dossier, an indictment of Waldheim, might have been complied with the sole aim of comprising him, not prosecuting him.
《华盛顿邮报》的报道还表明，这份卷宗是对瓦尔德海姆的起诉书，其唯一目的可能是遏制他，而不是起诉他。

Waldheim was never tried for war crimes.
瓦尔德海姆从未因战争罪受审。

A spokesman for Waldheim denied that he had ever been reproached for communist recruitment.
瓦尔德海姆的发言人否认他曾因招募共产党员而受到指责。

Under some pressure from Congress, there has been a review of the Waldheim case at the Justice Department for several months.
在国会的一些压力下，司法部对瓦尔德海姆案的审查已经持续了几个月。

Today, Attorney General Meese said that if Waldheim were to express a desire to visit the US, the details of his case that emerged today would be additional facts in the government’s review of the whole matter.
今天，司法部长米斯表示，如果瓦尔德海姆表达了访问美国的愿望，那么今天公布的他案件的细节将成为政府审查整个事件的额外事实。

There’s been yet another merger in the airline industry.
航空业又发生了一次合并。

The Delta, the sixth largest carrier in the United States, will join wings with Western, which ranks ninth.
美国第六大航空公司达美航空将与排名第九的西方航空公司联手。

By one standard, that will create the nation’s third largest airline.
按照一个标准，这将创建美国第三大航空公司。

The merger, agreed to by Western yesterday, makes sense, according to Con Hitchcock of the Aviation Consumer Action Project.
航空消费者行动项目的康·希区柯克 (Con Hitchcock) 表示，西部航空昨天同意的合并是有意义的。

"The reason that the merger makes sense for a company like Delta is that Delta’s based primarily in eastern United States, with a hub in Atlanta and some in Cincinnati and Dallas and Fort Worth.
“此次合并对于达美航空这样的公司有意义，因为达美航空的总部主要位于美国东部，枢纽位于亚特兰大，部分中心位于辛辛那提、达拉斯和沃斯堡。

But it doesn’t really have a western presence.
但它实际上并没有西方的存在。

Western is based in Salt Lake City and has also got a lot of presence in Los Angeles.
Western 总部位于盐湖城，在洛杉矶也有很多业务。

And if you can merge the two together successfully, there’s the chance you’ll have a successful large carrier that can compete with United and American and other companies that are bigger than Delta." "What about the urge to merge? We’ve had an incredibly large number of mergers just in the last six months or so." "There’s feeling in some sectors of the airline industry that if you want to be a survivor, if you want to be around, you have to get bigger.
如果你能成功地将两者合并在一起，你就有机会拥有一家成功的大型航空公司，可以与美联航、美国航空以及其他比达美航空规模更大的公司竞争。”“合并的冲动怎么样？仅在过去六个月左右的时间里，我们就进行了数量惊人的合并。”“航空业的某些部门有一种感觉，如果你想成为幸存者，如果你想生存下去，你就必须获得大。

You have to get into a number of markets, and the easy way to do that is to buy off your competitors rather than try to expand from within.
你必须进入多个市场，而做到这一点的简单方法就是收买你的竞争对手，而不是尝试从内部扩张。

And in some senses, it is easier to go out and raise the money rather than do things like try to get into the congested airports.
从某种意义上说，出去筹集资金比尝试进入拥挤的机场更容易。

You’ve got airports like Chicago and Denver and Los Angeles that are fairly crowded, that it’s just difficult to go in a big way and establish yourself and attract a lot of customers.
像芝加哥、丹佛和洛杉矶这样的机场相当拥挤，很难大范围发展并建立自己的地位并吸引大量客户。

And it’s easier to go out and buy a company with an established market position than try to work your way up from ground zero." "What about a time factor? Is there any reason we’re seeing all these merges now? Deregulation’s been with us since 1978.
出去收购一家已确立市场地位的公司比从零开始努力更容易。”“时间因素怎么样？我们现在看到所有这些合并有什么原因吗？自 1978 年以来，我们一直在放松管制。

Why now?" "I think there are a couple of reasons why there are so many airline merges now.
为什么是现在？” “我认为现在有如此多的航空公司合并有几个原因。

First of all, there’s sort of a herd mentality.
首先，有一种从众心理。

When United picked up Pan Am’s Pacific routes earlier this year, that set off a ripple effect.
当美联航今年早些时候开通泛美航空的太平洋航线时，引发了连锁反应。

Northwest said, well, we’re going to buy Republic in order to get bigger and compete, TWA Ozark, etc.
西北航空说，好吧，我们将收购共和航空、环球航空奥扎克航空等，以扩大规模并参与竞争。

etc." There really is a wave.
等等。”确实有一股浪潮。

Secondly, there’s the perception in the industry that the Department of Transportation which has to approve airline mergers, is more lenient than the Justice Department would be.
其次，业内普遍认为，必须批准航空公司合并的交通部比司法部更为宽松。

But D.O.T.  但是 D.O.T.

only has that authority for another two years.
该权力的有效期只有两年。

And there’s concern that if you don’t do it now, the Justice Department may stop you if you try a couple years from now.
有人担心，如果你现在不这样做，几年后你再尝试，司法部可能会阻止你。

The third reason is related to the tax bill.
第三个原因与税单有关。

The tax bill that’s pending in Congress will take away some of the benefits that make mergers easy to finance, staring on January 1st.
国会待决的税收法案将从 1 月 1 日起取消一些使合并易于融资的好处。

So I think you’re going to see a number of mergers in a lot of other industries as well between now and December 31st.
因此，我认为从现在到 12 月 31 日，许多其他行业也会出现大量合并。

"When deregulation came into being, there was a lot of talk that what would happen is, you would have four or five major airlines, a number of very successful regional airlines and the commuters.
“当放松管制出现时，有很多人说，将会发生的情况是，将会有四到五家主要航空公司、一些非常成功的支线航空公司和通勤者。

It seems as though that trend is here." "We seem to be headed in that direction, and it’s unfortunate.
似乎这种趋势就在这里。”“我们似乎正在朝这个方向前进，这是不幸的。

I mean, deregulation was supposed to be more airlines competing for consumers' business, not fewer.
我的意思是，放松管制应该让更多的航空公司争夺消费者的业务，而不是更少。

There is inevitably …" "Well, there are more." "There are more, but the big ones are getting bigger.
不可避免的是……” “嗯，还有更多。” “还有更多，但是大的越来越大。

And there are some advantages in the sense that you can travel from one city to another on a singer airline without having to change lines and that sort of thing.
从某种意义上说，它有一些优势，您可以乘坐歌手航空公司从一个城市飞往另一个城市，而无需换乘线路之类的事情。

But the drawback is the industry shrinks, is that you have fewer mavericks, or fewer airlines that might say, 'Gee, let’s start a price war to raise some more traffic.' It can get very comfortable very quickly, and I’m not sure that’s in the consumer’s interest in the long term." "Thanks very much.
但缺点是行业萎缩，特立独行的人越来越少，或者说“哎呀，让我们开始价格战以增加更多客流量”的航空公司越来越少。它很快就会变得非常舒适，我不确定从长远来看这是否符合消费者的利益。”“非常感谢。
