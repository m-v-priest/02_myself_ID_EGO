A bomb exploded early today in a mid-town Manhattan abortion clinic, slightly injuring two passers-by, but it did not stop those at the center from performing abortions later in the day.  +
The bombing caused about $10,000 in damage.  +
Police say
several phone calls to the bomb squad warned of the attack, but no one has claimed responsibility.  +
America's trade deficit grew at a slower pace again last month.  +
The gap between imports and exports expanded by $12,500,000,000 in September, $2,000,000,000 less than the August deficit increase.  +
It's the second straight monthly decline in the growth of the trade deficit.  +
Commerce Department says the figure showed that the administration's policy of lowering the dollar may be paying off.  +
The administration has also tried with mixed success, to persuade allies with big trade surpluses to stimulate their economies to expand export markets for US goods.  +
There are new details today on Austrian President Kurt Waldheim's involvement in the German army during WWII.  +
The full text of the 1947 Yugoslav indictment of Waldheim for war crimes was made public.  +
NPR's Mike Shuster has details.  +
"The indictment charges Waldheim with participating in the planning of German reprisals against Yugoslavian citizens in 1944 and 1945.  +
At the time, Waldheim was a lieutenant in a German Intelligence unit, and the indictment says Waldheim helped plan attacks that resulted in the burning of at least twenty villages and the execution of hundreds of Yugoslavian citizens.  +
It has been known that Waldheim had been indicted in Yugoslavia almost forty years ago.  +
But the specifics of the indictment were not known until today.  +
Yesterday, Waldheim, through a spokesman, admitted that he had been part of a unit that carried out a massacre in Yugoslavia in 1942.  +
But Waldheim denied a Washington Post report today that the Yugoslav and Soviet governments had used the file on Waldheim to blackmail him into becoming a communist agent.  +
The Post quotes intelligence sources in Yugoslavia as saying the blackmail had been successful.  +
This is Mike Shuster in New York." More important details emerged today about the case of Austrian President Kurt Waldheim's involvement it the German army during WWII.  +
In 1947, the former United Nations Secretary General was indicted in Yugoslavia for war crimes.  +
Today, the full text of that indictment became available.  +
Also today, reports that Yugoslavia and that Soviet Union may have blackmailed Waldheim during his diplomatic career.  +
NPR's Mike Shuster has a report.  +
Until now, it has been known that Yugoslavia indicted Waldheim forty years ago for war crimes, for murder and massacres in the shooting of hostages.  +
But until today, the specific crimes Waldheim was accused of were not known, nor was it known what these accusations were based on.  +
The indictment, a translation of which was released today by the Simon Wiesenfeld Center in the United States, specifies at least a score of villages in Yugoslavia that were targeted by the German army for reprisals in 1944 and 1945.  +
The indictment, according to Mark Weitzman, a spokesman for the Wiesenfeld Center, charges that Waldheim actually participated in the planning for
those reprisals.  +
"They lay a list of twenty-one villages and towns directly there.  +
And I'll quote.  +
Many more similar crimes can be cited: May 1944, village was burned; Macednia, September-October '44, shot civilians in many villages.  +
Even more detailed: village of Smola where four persons were shot; Garbervo, twenty-four houses burned, two people shot." In 1944 and 45, the German army undertook a series of reprisals in the Yugoslav regions of Basnia, Mecedonia and Montenegro in retaliation for partisan attacks on German army units.  +
The reprisals usually involved the execution of local civilians: ten Yugoslavians for each German killed and the torching of villages.  +
The indictment of Waldheim makes the argument that Hitler ordered the policy of reprisal in the Balkans, but that all the details—the quota of hostages taken, the specific arrests and executions, the specific villages burned—were for the local German army intelligence units to work out.  +
Waldheim was a lieutenant in one of those units.  +
The indictment does not specify his presence, but there's no question about it, issuing responsibility to him, I mean, just to sum up the indictment, and I'll read: "On the basis of all that has been set forth, the state commission confirms that Lieutenant Kurt Waldheim is a war criminal responsible for the war crimes described and assessed above." Throughout his campaign last spring for the Austrian Presidency, Waldheim maintained that he was only a supply officer and an interpreter in his unit in the Balkans.  +
But yesterday through a spokesman, Waldheim admitted that he was connected with a unit that carried out a massacre in Yugoslavia in 1942.  +
The spokesman did not address the allegations in the indictment made public today.  +
The Washington Post reported today that the Yugoslav and Soviet governments may have used the indictment and the investigative file it was based on to blackmail Waldheim into becoming a communist agent.  +
The Post quotes former Yugoslav intelligence and government officials as saying they were involved in an effort to blackmail Waldheim in 1948.  +
One former official, according to the Post , says that Moscow informed the Yugoslav government in 1948 that Waldheim had been recruited.  +
The Post report also suggests that the dossier, an indictment of Waldheim, might have been complied with the sole aim of comprising him, not prosecuting him.  +
Waldheim was never tried for war crimes.  +
A spokesman for Waldheim denied that he had ever been reproached for communist recruitment.  +
Under some pressure from Congress, there has been a review of the Waldheim case at the Justice Department for several months.  +
Today, Attorney General Meese said that if Waldheim were to express a desire to visit the US, the details of his case that emerged today would be additional facts in the government's review of the whole matter.  +

There's been yet another merger in the airline industry.  +
The Delta, the sixth largest carrier in the United States, will join wings with Western, which ranks ninth.  +
By one standard, that will create the nation's third largest airline.  +
The merger, agreed to by
Western yesterday, makes sense, according to Con Hitchcock of the Aviation Consumer Action Project.  +
"The reason that the merger makes sense for a company like Delta is that Delta's based primarily in eastern United States, with a hub in Atlanta and some in Cincinnati and Dallas and Fort Worth.  +
But it doesn't really have a western presence.  +
Western is based in Salt Lake City and has also got a lot of presence in Los Angeles.  +
And if you can merge the two together successfully, there's the chance you'll have a successful large carrier that can compete with United and American and other companies that are bigger than Delta." "What about the urge to merge? We've had an incredibly large number of mergers just in the last six months or so." "There's feeling in some sectors of the airline industry that if you want to be a survivor, if you want to be around, you have to get bigger.  +
You have to get into a number of markets, and the easy way to do that is to buy off your competitors rather than try to expand from within.  +
And in some senses, it is easier to go out and raise the money rather than do things like try to get into the congested airports.  +
You've got airports like Chicago and Denver and Los Angeles that are fairly crowded, that it's just difficult to go in a big way and establish yourself and attract a lot of customers.  +
And it's easier to go out and buy a company with an established market position than try to work your way up from ground zero." "What about a time factor? Is there any reason we're seeing all these merges now? Deregulation's been with us since 1978.  +
Why now?" "I think there are a couple of reasons why there are so many airline merges now.  +
First of all, there's sort of a herd mentality.  +
When United picked up Pan Am's Pacific routes earlier this year, that set off a ripple effect.  +
Northwest said, well, we're going to buy Republic in order to get bigger and compete, TWA Ozark, etc.  +
etc." There really is a wave.  +
Secondly, there's the perception in the industry that the Department of Transportation which has to approve airline mergers, is more lenient than the Justice Department would be.  +
But D.O.T.  +
only has that authority for another two years.  +
And there's concern that if you don't do it now, the Justice Department may stop you if you try a couple years from now.  +
The third reason is related to the tax bill.  +
The tax bill that's pending in Congress will take away some of the benefits that make mergers easy to finance, staring on January 1st.  +
So I think you're going to see a number of mergers in a lot of other industries as well between now and December 31st.  +
"When deregulation came into being, there was a lot of talk that what would happen is, you would have four or five major airlines, a number of very successful regional airlines and the commuters.  +
It seems as though that trend is here." "We seem to be headed in that direction, and it's unfortunate.  +
I mean, deregulation was supposed to be more airlines competing for consumers' business, not fewer.  +
There is inevitably …" "Well, there are more." "There are more, but the big ones are getting bigger.  +
And there are some advantages in the sense that you can travel from one city to another on a singer airline without having to change lines and that sort of thing.  +
But the drawback is the industry shrinks,
is that you have fewer mavericks, or fewer airlines that might say, 'Gee, let's start a price war to raise some more traffic.' It can get very comfortable very quickly, and I'm not sure that's in the consumer's interest in the long term." "Thanks very much.  +

今天早些时候，一枚炸弹在曼哈顿市中心的一家堕胎诊所爆炸，两名路人受轻伤，但这并没有阻止中心人员在当天晚些时候进行堕胎手术。爆炸造成约 10,000 美元的损失。警方称，拆弹小组多次接到电话警告这起袭击事件，但没有人声称对此负责。上个月美国贸易逆差增速再次放缓。 9月份进出口逆差扩大125亿美元，比8月份逆差增幅收窄20亿美元。这是贸易逆差增幅连续第二个月下降。美国商务部表示，该数据表明政府压低美元汇率的政策可能正在取得成效。政府还试图说服拥有巨额贸易顺差的盟友刺激其经济，扩大美国商品的出口市场，但效果参差不齐。今天有关于奥地利总统库尔特·瓦尔德海姆在二战期间参与德国军队的新细节。 1947 年南斯拉夫对瓦尔德海姆战争罪的起诉书全文被公开。 NPR 的迈克·舒斯特 (Mike Shuster) 提供了详细信息。 “起诉书指控瓦尔德海姆参与策划了 1944 年和 1945 年德国对南斯拉夫公民的报复。当时，瓦尔德海姆是德国情报部门的中尉，起诉书称瓦尔德海姆帮助策划了袭击，导致烧毁了至少二十个村庄和数百名南斯拉夫公民被处决。据了解，瓦尔德海姆大约四十年前就在南斯拉夫被起诉。但起诉书的具体内容直到今天才为人所知。昨天，瓦尔德海姆通过发言人承认，他曾是 1942 年在南斯拉夫实施大屠杀的部队的一员。 但瓦尔德海姆今天否认了《华盛顿邮报》的报道，即南斯拉夫和苏联政府利用瓦尔德海姆的档案来勒索他成为共产主义特工。 《华盛顿邮报》援引南斯拉夫情报来源的话说，勒索已经成功。我是纽约的迈克·舒斯特。”今天，有关奥地利总统库尔特·瓦尔德海姆在二战期间参与德国军队一案的更多重要细节浮出水面。1947 年，这位前联合国秘书长在南斯拉夫因战争罪被起诉。今天，该起诉书的全文已经公布。同样在今天，有报道称南斯拉夫和苏联可能在瓦尔德海姆的外交生涯中勒索他。NPR 的迈克·舒斯特有一份报告。到目前为止，人们都知道南斯拉夫在四十年前因战争而起诉了瓦尔德海姆罪行，谋杀和枪杀人质中的屠杀。但直到今天，瓦尔德海姆被指控的具体罪行尚不清楚，也不知道这些指控的依据是什么。起诉书的翻译今天由美国西蒙·维森菲尔德中心指定了至少 20 个南斯拉夫村庄，这些村庄在 1944 年和 1945 年成为德国军队报复的目标。维森菲尔德中心发言人马克·韦茨曼表示，起诉书指控瓦尔德海姆实际上参与了这些报复的策划。 “他们直接在那里列出了 21 个村庄和城镇的名单。我会引用。还可以引用更多类似的罪行：1944 年 5 月，村庄被烧毁；马其顿，44 年 9 月至 10 月，枪杀了许多村庄的平民。更详细的是：斯莫拉村有四人被枪杀；加伯沃村有二十四间房屋被烧毁，两人被枪杀。1944年和45年，德国军队在南斯拉夫的巴斯尼亚、麦其顿和黑山地区进行了一系列报复行动，以报复游击队对德国军队的袭击。这些报复行动通常涉及处决当地平民：每杀一个德国人，就有十个南斯拉夫人被处决。瓦尔德海姆的起诉书认为，希特勒下令在巴尔干地区采取报复政策，但所有细节——劫持人质的配额、具体的逮捕和处决、烧毁的具体村庄——都是为了当地的德国陆军情报单位需要解决。瓦尔德海姆是其中一个单位的中尉。起诉书没有具体说明他的存在，但毫无疑问，向他追究责任，我的意思是，只是为了总结起诉书，并且我将读到：“根据所有陈述，国家委员会确认库尔特·瓦尔德海姆中尉是一名战犯，对上述所描述和评估的战争罪行负有责任。”在他去年春天竞选奥地利总统期间，瓦尔德海姆坚称，他在巴尔干地区的部队中只是一名补给官和一名翻译。但昨天，瓦尔德海姆通过发言人承认，他与1942年在南斯拉夫实施大屠杀的一支部队有关。发言人没有回应今天公布的起诉书中的指控。 《华盛顿邮报》今天报道称，南斯拉夫和苏联政府可能利用起诉书及其所依据的调查档案来勒索瓦尔德海姆，使其成为一名共产主义特工。 《华盛顿邮报》援引前南斯拉夫情报和政府官员的话说，他们参与了 1948 年勒索瓦尔德海姆的活动。 据《华盛顿邮报》报道，一名前官员称，莫斯科于 1948 年通知南斯拉夫政府，瓦尔德海姆已被招募。 《华盛顿邮报》的报道还表明，这份卷宗是对瓦尔德海姆的起诉书，其唯一目的可能是遏制他，而不是起诉他。瓦尔德海姆从未因战争罪受审。瓦尔德海姆的发言人否认他曾因招募共产党员而受到指责。在国会的一些压力下，司法部对瓦尔德海姆案的审查已经持续了几个月。今天，司法部长米斯表示，如果瓦尔德海姆表达了访问美国的愿望，那么今天公布的他案件的细节将成为政府审查整个事件的额外事实。我是纽约的迈克·舒斯特。航空业又发生了一次合并。美国第六大航空公司达美航空将与排名第九的西方航空公司联手。按照一个标准，这将创建美国第三大航空公司。航空消费者行动项目的康·希区柯克 (Con Hitchcock) 表示，西部航空昨天同意的合并是有意义的。 “此次合并对于达美航空这样的公司有意义，因为达美航空的总部主要位于美国东部，枢纽位于亚特兰大，部分地区位于辛辛那提、达拉斯和沃斯堡。但它在西部并没有真正的业务。西部总部位于盐湖城，在洛杉矶也有很多业务。如果你能成功地将两者合并在一起，你就有机会拥有一家成功的大型航空公司，可以与联合航空、美国航空和其他公司竞争比达美航空还要大。” “合并的冲动怎么样？ 仅在过去六个月左右的时间里，我们就进行了数量惊人的合并。”“航空业的某些部门有一种感觉，如果你想成为幸存者，如果你想生存下去，你就必须获得大。你必须进入多个市场，而做到这一点的简单方法就是收买你的竞争对手，而不是尝试从内部扩张。从某种意义上说，出去筹集资金比尝试进入拥挤的机场更容易。像芝加哥、丹佛和洛杉矶这样的机场相当拥挤，很难大范围发展并建立自己的地位并吸引大量客户。出去收购一家已确立市场地位的公司比从零开始努力更容易。”“时间因素怎么样？我们现在看到所有这些合并有什么原因吗？自 1978 年以来，我们一直在放松管制。为什么是现在？” “我认为现在出现如此多的航空公司合并有几个原因。首先，有一种从众心理。当美联航今年早些时候开通泛美航空的太平洋航线时，引发了连锁反应。西北航空说，好吧，我们将收购共和航空、环球航空奥索卡航空等公司，以便变得更大并参与竞争。批准航空公司合并，比司法部更宽松。但交通部的授权期限只有两年。而且有人担心，如果你现在不这样做，如果你尝试几年，司法部可能会阻止你从现在来看，第三个原因与税单有关。 国会待决的税收法案将从 1 月 1 日起取消一些使合并易于融资的好处。因此，我认为从现在到 12 月 31 日，许多其他行业也会出现大量合并。 “当放松管制出现时，有很多人说将会发生的事情是，将会有四到五家主要航空公司，一些非常成功的支线航空公司和通勤者。似乎这种趋势就在这里。” “我们似乎正在朝这个方向前进，这是不幸的。我的意思是，放松管制应该让更多的航空公司争夺消费者的业务，而不是更少。不可避免地……”“嗯，还有更多。” “还有更多，但大的越来越大。从某种意义上说，有一些优势，你可以乘坐歌手航空公司从一个城市飞往另一个城市，而无需换线之类的事情。但缺点是行业萎缩的一个原因是，特立独行者越来越少，或者说“哎呀，让我们开始一场价格战来提高客流量”的航空公司越来越少。它很快就会变得非常舒适，我不确定从长远来看这是否符合消费者的利益。” “非常感谢。航空消费者行动项目的康希区柯克。”
