This much is clear tonight: an American held in Lebanon for almost a year and a half is free.  +

David Jacobsen is recuperating in a hospital in Wiesbaden, West Germany.  +

Twenty-four hours earlier, Jacobsen was released in Beirut by Islamic Jihad.  +

But this remains a mystery: what precisely led to his freedom? Jacobsen will spend the next several days in the US air force facility in Wiesbaden for a medical examination.  +

Diedre Barber reports.  +

After preliminary medical checkups today, David Jacobsen's doctor said he was tired but physically in very good condition.  +

US air force hospital commander, Charles Moffitt, said in a medical briefing this afternoon that Jacobsen had lost little weight and seemed extremely fit.  +

He joked that he would not like to take up Jacobsen's challenge to reporters earlier in the day to a six-mile jog around the airport.  +

Despite
his obvious fatigue, Jacobsen spent the afternoon being examined by hospital doctors.  +

He was also seen by a member of the special stress-management team sent from Washington.  +

Colonel Moffitt said that after an initial evaluation it seems as if Jacobsen coped extremely well with the stresses of his captivity.  +

He said there was also no evidence at this point that the fifty-five-year-old hospital director had been tortured or physically abused.  +

Jacobsen seemed very alert, asking detailed questions about the facilities of the Wiesbaden medical complex, according to Moffitt.  +

So far, Jacobsen has refused to answer questions about his five hundred and twenty-four days as a hostage.  +

Speaking briefly to reports after his arrival in Wiesbaden this morning, he said his joy at being free was somewhat diminished by his concern for the other hostages left behind.  +

He thanked the US government and President Ronald Reagan for helping to secure his release.  +

Jacobsen also gave special thanks to Terry Waite, an envoy of the Archbishop of Canterbury, for his help in the negotiation.  +

Waite who accompanied Jacobsen from Beirut to Wiesbaden today, said he might be going to Beirut in several days.  +

There are still seven American hostages being held in Lebanon by different political groups.  +

Jacobsen will be joined in Wiesbaden tomorrow by his family.  +

Hospital officials said they still do not know how many days Jacobsen will remain for tests and debriefing sessions before returning to the United States with his family.  +

For National Public Radio, this is Diedre Barber, Wiesbaden.

The leader of Chinese revolution, Mao Tsetong, died ten years ago today.  +

During his lifetime, Mao became a cult figure, but the current government has tried to change that.  +

Now his tomb and embalmed body in Beijing are just another tourist attraction.  +

And no longer do millions of Chinese study or wave aloft the famous "Little Red Book" of Quotations from Chairman Mao.  +

Along with the political writing, Mao wrote poetry as well—poems about the revolution, the Red Army, poems about nature.  +

Willis Barnstone has translated some of Mao's work and considers him an original master, one of China's most important poets.  +

"Had he not been a revolutionary, perhaps his poetry would not have been as interesting because his personal poetry was the history of China.  +

At the same time because he was a famous revolutionary and leader, it has prejudiced most people, almost correctly, to dismiss his poetry as simply the work of a man who achieved fame elsewhere." "But his work was not dismissed within China though?" "Well, now it's almost consciously forgotten.  +

But when I was there in '72, you could see his poems on every dining room wall, engraved on peach-pits ...  +

During lunch hours, workers would study his poems.  +

They were every place." "Is there, though, a revisionist thinking within literary circles? Are people saying Mao wasn't any good as a poet either?" "No.  +

Well, at least in my conversations in the year I recently spent in Peking teaching at the university there, I found very few people who didn't think he was a very good poet.  +

But they did feel that his suggestions which were that people not write in the
classical style, that they write in what he called the modern style, was very repressive.  +

And as a result, of course, the restriction of publication during the ten years of the Cultural Revolution, poetry was abysmal." "When you say the modern style, would that be, for example, free verse?" "It would be free verse as opposed to classical rhymes or classical forms." "You write in the introduction to one of your translations of poems of Mao Tsetong that people ...  +

you explain that leaders in China, and indeed in the a East, are expected to be accomplished poets." "Yes, I think that's true.  +

The night that Tojo ...  before Tojo died, he, ...  in Japan, he wrote some poems.  +

Ho Chi Minh was a poet.  +

It was common.  +

In fact, I think until early in the twentieth century, even to pass a bureaucratic exam, one had to know a huge number of classical forms.  +

And especially, a leader should at least be a poet." "There is one poem which is political in nature which has to do with a parasitic disease in China." "Yes.  +

Mao wrote some poems, two poems actually, about getting rid of a disease that was a plague for the country.  +

And it's called 'Saying goodbye to the God of Disease.' And the poem needs annotation.  +

In that sense, it's typical of classical Chinese poetry; he makes references to earlier emperors and places.  +

Saying Goodbye to the God of Disease Mauve waters and green mountains are nothing When the great ancient doctor Hua Tuo Could not defeat a tiny worm.  +

A thousand villages collapsed, were choked with weeds, Men were lost arrows, ghosts sang In the doorway of a few desolate houses.  +

Yet now in a day, we leap around the earth, Or explore a thousand milky ways.  +

And if the cowherd who loves on a star Asks about the God of plagues, Tell him, happy or sad, "The God is gone, Washed away in the waters." A poem by Mao Tsetong read by Willis Barnstone, Professor of Comparative Literature at Indiana University in Bloomington.  +

He talked with us from WFIU.


中国革命领袖毛泽东逝世十年前的今天。毛泽东在世时, 就成为了一个崇拜的人物，但现任政府试图改变这一点。现在，他在北京的坟墓和防腐尸体, 只是另一个旅游景点。数以百万计的中国人, 不再学习或高举著名的毛主席语录“红宝书”。除了政治写作之外，毛泽东还写诗——关于革命、红军、关于自然的诗。威利斯·巴恩斯通翻译了毛泽东的一些作品，并认为他是一位原创大师，也是中国最重要的诗人之一。 “如果他不是革命者，也许他的诗就不会那么有趣，因为他个人的诗就是中国的历史。 同时，由于他是一位著名的革命家和领袖，大多数人都会带着偏见，认为他的诗歌, 仅仅是一个在其他地方成名的人的作品，这几乎是正确的。”“但他的作品在中国并没有被忽视？ ” “好吧，现在已经快有意识地忘记了。但72年我在那里的时候，你可以在每个餐厅的墙上看到他的诗，刻在桃核上……​午餐时间，工人们会研究他的诗。到处都是。” “文学界有修正主义思想吗？人们是否也说, 毛泽东也不是一个优秀的诗人？” “没有。嗯，至少在我最近在北京大学任教的那一年的谈话中，我发现很少有人不认为他是一位非常好的诗人。但他们确实觉得, 他的建议是非常压抑的，即人们不要以古典风格写作，而应以他所谓的现代风格写作。当然，结果是文革十年期间限制出版，诗歌很糟糕。” “你说的现代风格，是不是就是自由诗？” “是自由诗吗？”诗句，而不是古典韵律或古典形式。”“您在您翻译的毛泽东诗歌之一的序言中写道，人们……​您解释说，中国乃至东方的领导人, 都应该取得成就诗人。” “是的，我认为这是真的。东条的那个晚上……东条去世前，他……在日本写了一些诗。胡志明是一位诗人。这很常见。事实上，我认为直到二十世纪初，即使是为了通过官僚考试，也必须了解大量的古典形式。尤其是，领导者至少应该是一位诗人。” “有一首诗具有政治性质，与中国的一种寄生虫病有关。” “是的。毛泽东写了一些诗，实际上是两首诗，内容是关于消除给国家带来瘟疫的疾病。它的名字叫“告别病神”(绿水青山枉自多，华佗无奈小虫何！千村薜荔人遗矢，万户萧疏鬼唱歌。坐地日行八万里，巡天遥看一千河。牛郎欲问瘟神事，一样悲欢逐逝波。)。这首诗还需要注释。从这个意义上说，它是典型的中国古典诗歌；他提到了早期的皇帝和地方。辞别病神，紫水青山算不得什么，古代大医华佗也敌不过一条小虫。千村倒塌，杂草丛生，人失箭，鬼在几间荒宅门口歌唱。然而现在一天之内，我们就绕地球一圈，或者探索一千条银河系。如果爱在星星上的牛郎询问瘟疫之神，无论高兴还是悲伤，都告诉他：“上帝走了，被水冲走了。”印第安纳大学布卢明顿分校, 比较文学教授 威利斯·巴恩斯通, 朗读了毛泽东的一首诗。他从 WFIU 与我们进行了交谈。
