Lesson15


American reporter Nicholas Daniloff arrived back in the United States today, and accused Soviet spy, Gennadi Zakharov, left for the Soviet Union.  +
Administration officials insisted that there is no connection between the two as they announce plans for a meeting in Iceland, October 11th and 12th, between President Reagan and Soviet leader Gorbachev.  +
We have two reports on today's developments.  +
First, NPR's Jim Angle at the White House.  +
"The preparatory meeting in Iceland was proposed by Secretary Gorbachev in a letter to President Reagan September 19.  +
Secretary Shultz said, today, the meeting will give the two leaders an opportunity to give a special push to preparations for a full-fledged summit later this year in the United States.  +
President Reagan made clear his agreement to the meeting came after an agreement between the two nations on how to resolve the Daniloff affair.  +
'The release of Daniloff made the meeting possible.  +
I could not have accepted and held that meeting if he was still being held.' But the President and others insisted that Daniloff's release without trial had no connection with Gennadi Zakharov, the accused Soviet spy who was allowed to plead no contest to espionage charges today and ordered out of the country.  +
Secretary Shultz tied Zakharov's departure to the Soviet agreement to release human rights' activist, Yuri Orlov, and allow him and his wife to emigrate.  +
I'm Jim Angle, at the White House." The Vatican today denounced all homosexual activity as morally evil and said homosexuals should be taught that their sexual practices are unacceptable to the Catholic church.  +
The document was relayed to Catholic bishops and restates the church's position that homosexual tendencies are not sinful but activity is.  +
This is NPR in Washington.
University of Maryland basketball coach Lefty Dresell resigned today, another victim of the cocaine-induced death of basketball star Len Bias.  +
Paul Guggenheimer reports.  +
"Dresell's resignation came as no surprise today.  +
In recent weeks, advisors to Maryland Chancellor John Slaughter and some members of the Board of Regents were pushing for Dresell's removal.  +
This morning, at Maryland's Cole Field House, Dresell made it official.  +
'I want to announce that I am stepping down as the head basketball coach at Maryland.  +
I will remain at Maryland in the position of Assistant Athletic Director.  +
The University has agreed to honor the financial terms of my contract, which has 8 years remaining.' Dresell coached basketball at Maryland for 17 years, but following Bias's death, Dresell told a Grand Jury that he ordered an assistant to remove evidence of drug use from Bias's room, and subsequent revelations that his players were having academic problems proved to be Dresell's undoing.  +
For National Public Radio, I'm Paul Guggenheimer in Washington." American journalist, Nicholas Daniloff, returned to the United Stated today, a free man.  +
He walked off a plane at Dulles Airport outside Washington late this afternoon after a month's detention in the Soviet Union.  +
Daniloff had these words for members of his family and journalists at the airport: "There is always a silver lining in every cloud.  +
In Russian, Nyet Kuda bisdabra.  +
And I believe that the cloud that hung over Soviet-American affairs is dissipating.  +
I understand that the President is going to meet with Mr.  +
Gorbachev shortly in Iceland, and this to me, is a wonderful thing.  +
In my case, the investigation into the charges against me was concluded.  +
There was no trial, and I left as an ordinary, free American citizen.  +
In Zakharov's case, there was a trial, and he received a sentence.  +
I'm sorry I don't remember the exact terms of the sentence, and he left.  +
I do not believe that these two things are in any way equivalent." NPR's Richard Gonzalez is at Dulles Airport now.  +
"Richard, what was the mood of Daniloff and his family when he arrived?" "Well, the Daniloffs enjoyed a rather emotional reunion here at Dulles Airport.  +
Daniloff was cheerfully greeted by his daughter Miranda and his son, Caleb.  +
They celebrated his arrival with a bottle of champagne.  +
And they bought a dozen of yellow roses for their father.  +
Caleb presented his father with a T-shirt that had been printed to say "Free Nick Daniloff" and now had been amended to say "Freed Nick Daniloff", which Daniloff displayed with obvious relish to the cameramen and photographers who were gathered there." "What seemed most on Daniloff's mind when he spoke with reporters today?" "Well, as you heard him say, Daniloff seemed very, very relieved that his own personal honor and integrity as a journalist had been preserved in the negotiations that had freed him.  +
And he repeated once or twice that that he felt that he had not been traded for Zakharov as a spy." "Is there any chance Daniloff who is completing a second tour as a journalist in Moscow will return to the Soviet Union?" "Well, Daniloff told us that he left the Soviet Union with his passport and just as
importantly with his multiple-entry visa, 'which is still valid,' he said.  +
And he ended his news conference by telling reporters that yesterday in Moscow, feeling that he might be leaving the Soviet Union soon, he had placed new flowers on the grave of his great grandfather who was buried in Moscow.  +
And he said, 'I'm hopeful that I'll be able to do that again, some time.'" "But who knows what will happen? What else can you tell us about what the scene looked like there?" "Well, I can tell you that there were throngs of reporters here too, some of whom wanted to greet Mr.  +
Daniloff with applause, and that it took a while for Daniloff to get their attention so that he could tell them what they wanted to hear.  +
I think that the most obvious thing is that he had a lot of friends here, among the press corps, that were very happy to see him, and I think that he really … he had a sparkle in his eye that said, 'Well, I'm finally home.'" "So he seemed a lot more rested perhaps than in Frankfurt?" "Rested, relieved, and I'd have to say well scrubbed." "(Laugh).  +
NPR's Richard Gonzalez talking with us from Dulles Airport." Today, Van Gordon Sauter, the President of CBS News resigned from his job.  +
This resignation, the latest move in a CBS shake-up, which yesterday brought the ouster of CBS Chief Executive Officer Thomas Wyman.  +
He was replaced by Laurence Tisch, the company's leading stockholder.  +
Also, yesterday, the 82-year-old founder of CBS, William Paley, came out of retirement to become the company's Chairman.  +
Writer Ken Aleter says the CBS Board probably put the changes into motion even before the Board meeting yesterday.  +
"There was a regularly scheduled Board dinner, an informal dinner the night before, which is normal for a monthly Board meeting.  +
And Wyman cancelled it, feeling that the Board was so polarized in the battle between Laurence Tisch and Paley on one side, and Thomas Wyman and some of the Board members who are supporters of his on the other.  +
But the Board decided to meet anyway without Tisch or Paley or Wyman, and they apparently met till quite late, which would be Tuesday night.  +
Then at the meeting yesterday, Mr.  +
Wyman presented a budget as planned, and apparently, the Board unanimously was dissatisfied with that budget presentation.  +
And then it was learned that, in fact, there had been, at least I'm informed, that there were overtures made by Wyman and by others aligned with him to try and sell the company, try and find a white knight to stave off Laurence Tisch and Bill Paley." "Last minute scrambling by Wyman?" "Yes, and in the end, the Board asked Tisch and Paley to leave, and then they asked Wyman to leave.  +
So the 3 principle actors in this drama were out of the room when the Board discussed it, and I'm told, unanimously reached the judgment that it was time for a change.  +
" "So it's not really fair to say that Laurence Tisch came rolling into that meeting and just took it over."
"Well, apparently the Board took it over.  +
What happened was, as of late last week, this Board was ready to support Tom Wyman.  +
Something happened in the last several days to turn this Board around.  +
And I think, in part, that something that happened was a growing sense of dissatisfaction with Wyman.  +
And I suspect also, a sense that the Board probably had that the continued blood-letting in the press, would only continue if Wyman remained the helm, and they had to stop it." "Yeah.  +
Let me ask you for a very simplistic answer to a complicated question here.  +
CBS got into this sort of trouble because of problems endemic to the television industry now, or because of mismanagement of CBS?" "Both.  +
Clearly, same thing is happening in all the networks.  +
They're facing a future, at least the immediate future, where revenues no longer grow at the same rate they used to, which is 10, 12, 14 percent a year.  +
Revenues are declining at all three networks.  +
Advertisers are finding other outlets for their money, more efficient outlets, cheaper outlets for their money.  +
There's new competition from the 4th network, from technology, from cable.  +
Second, there was a feeling that, Wyman, though he was a good manager on paper and had a good strong managerial background, was not a people manager.  +
Television is populated by a lot of famous people, who have rather large egos.  +
They're also rather large talents.  +
But in any case, those egos require some stroking.  +
Tom Wyman was not was not a stroker.  +
He was a go-by-the-book kind of manager.  +
So he was a stranger, for instance, to the most important division of CBS, not the division that produces the most money, but the one that produces the most prestige, and that's the news division.  +
" "The CBS News people, as you mention, have been disenchanted of late, and they're probably encouraged by this move, but specifically, what were they fussing about? How have they been mismanaged? Can anyone say?" "Well, I think there are probably a thousand different stories.  +
One story that's received a lot of prominence in the last week is Bill Moyer's story, which is a feeling that the entertainment values at CBS have been enshrined at the expense of news values.  +
That, however, is probably also a little simplistic if you go back to Edward R.  +
Morrow, the late sainted Edward R.  +
Morrow, who's a wonderful journalist, but who was also a journalist who sometimes enshrined entertainment values, for instance, if you go back and look at person-to-person interviews that he did on a program called 'Person to Person', it was a kind of a 'Gee, whiz, oh gosh, it's so nice to be invited into your home' kind of an atmosphere, and hardly hard news.  +
But I think Moyers' complaint suggests how polarized the situation at CBS is." "Ken Aleter.  +
He's the author of the book, Greed and Glory on Wall Street , talking with us in n New York."



美国记者尼古拉斯·达尼洛夫今天回到美国，指责苏联间谍根纳季·扎哈罗夫前往苏联。政府官员在宣布里根总统和苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫计划于 10 月 11 日至 12 日在冰岛举行会议时坚称两者之间没有联系。我们有两份关于当今事态发展的报告。首先是美国国家公共广播电台 (NPR) 的吉姆·安格 (Jim Angle) 在白宫。 “在冰岛举行筹备会议是戈尔巴乔夫国务卿在9月19日致里根总统的信中提议的。舒尔茨国务卿表示，今天的会议将为两国领导人提供一个机会，特别推动今年晚些时候举行的正式峰会的准备工作。里根总统明确表示，在两国就如何解决达尼洛夫事件达成一致之后，他同意举行这次会议。“达尼洛夫的释放使这次会议成为可能。我不可能接受并举行这次会议如果他还被关押的话。但总统和其他人坚持认为，达尼洛夫未经审判即被释放与被指控的苏联间谍根纳季·扎哈罗夫没有任何关系，扎哈罗夫今天被允许对间谍指控进行无异议的辩护，并被勒令离开该国。国务卿舒尔茨将扎哈罗夫的离开与苏联的协议联系在一起释放人权活动家尤里·奥尔洛夫，并允许他和他的妻子移民。我是白宫的吉姆·安格。”梵蒂冈今天谴责所有同性恋活动在道德上是邪恶的，并表示应该教导同性恋者，他们的性行为是天主教会不可接受的。该文件被转发给天主教主教，并重申了教会的立场，即同性恋倾向不是有罪的，但同性恋活动才是有罪的。这是华盛顿的 NPR。 马里兰大学篮球教练左夫蒂·德雷塞尔 (Lefty Dresell) 今天辞职，他是篮球明星伦·比亚斯 (Len Bias) 可卡因致死的另一受害者。保罗·古根海默报道。 “德雷塞尔今天的辞职并不令人意外。最近几周，马里兰州财政大臣约翰·斯劳特的顾问和董事会的一些成员一直在推动德雷塞尔的免职。今天早上，在马里兰州的科尔球场，德雷塞尔正式宣布了这一决定。‘我希望“我宣布辞去马里兰州篮球主教练的职务。我将继续留在马里兰州，担任助理体育总监。学校已同意履行我合同中的财务条款，合同还剩 8 年。”德雷塞尔在马里兰州执教了 17 年篮球队，但在比亚斯去世后，德雷塞尔告诉大陪审团，他命令一名助手从比亚斯的房间里清除吸毒的证据，随后他的球员出现学业问题的消息被揭露，这导致了德雷塞尔的失败。对于国家公共广播电台，我是华盛顿的保罗·古根海默。”美国记者尼古拉斯·达尼洛夫今天以自由身返回美国。在苏联被拘留一个月后，他于今天下午晚些时候在华盛顿郊外的杜勒斯机场走下飞机。达尼洛夫在机场对他的家人和记者说：“每片乌云中总有一线希望。俄语的意思是 Nyet Kuda bisdabra。我相信笼罩在苏美事务上的乌云正在消散。我我知道总统不久将在冰岛会见戈尔巴乔夫先生，这对我来说是一件美妙的事情。就我而言，对我的指控的调查已经结束。没有进行审判，我作为一名普通、自由的美国公民。 扎哈罗夫的案件经过审判，他被判刑。抱歉，我不记得这句话的具体内容了，然后他就离开了。我不认为这两件事是等同的。” NPR 的理查德·冈萨雷斯现在在杜勒斯机场。“理查德，到达时丹尼洛夫和他的家人的心情如何？”在杜勒斯机场重聚。丹尼洛夫受到女儿米兰达和儿子迦勒的热情欢迎。他们用一瓶香槟庆祝他的到来。他们还给父亲买了一打黄玫瑰。迦勒送给他父亲一件 T 恤，上面印着“释放尼克·丹尼洛夫”，现在被修改为“释放尼克·丹尼洛夫”，丹尼洛夫向聚集在那里的摄影师和摄影师展示了这件 T 恤，这显然很有趣。 “丹尼洛夫今天与记者交谈时，他脑子里最想的是什么？” 。他一两次重复说，他觉得自己没有被当作间谍交换给扎哈罗夫。” “正在莫斯科完成第二次记者之旅的达尼洛夫有没有可能返回苏联？” “好吧。丹尼洛夫告诉我们，他带着护照离开了苏联，同样重要的是，他带着多次入境签证离开了苏联，“签证仍然有效”，他说。他在新闻发布会结束时告诉记者，昨天在莫斯科，他感觉自己可能很快就会离开苏联，在埋葬在莫斯科的曾祖父的坟墓上献上了新花。他说，‘我希望有一天我能再次做到这一点。’” “但是谁知道会发生什么？你还能告诉我们那里的场景吗？” “好吧，我可以告诉你，这里也有成群结队的记者，其中一些人想用掌声向达尼洛夫先生致意，过了一段时间才开始。丹尼洛夫想引起他们的注意，这样他就可以告诉他们他们想听的话。我认为最明显的事情是，他在这里有很多朋友，在记者团中，他们很高兴见到他，我认为他真的……他的眼睛里闪烁着光芒，说，‘好吧，我终于到家了。’” “所以他看起来可能比在法兰克福休息多了？” “休息了，松了口气，而且我不得不说擦洗得很好。” “（笑）。 NPR 的理查德·冈萨雷斯 (Richard Gonzalez) 在杜勒斯机场与我们交谈。”今天，哥伦比亚广播公司 (CBS) 新闻总裁范戈登·索特 (Van Gordon Sauter) 辞职。这一辞职是哥伦比亚广播公司 (CBS) 改组的最新举措，昨天，哥伦比亚广播公司 (CBS) 首席执行官被罢免。托马斯·怀曼（Thomas Wyman）。他被公司主要股东劳伦斯·蒂施（Laurence Tisch）取代。此外，昨天，82 岁的哥伦比亚广播公司创始人威廉·佩利（William Paley）复出，成为公司董事长。作家肯·阿莱特（Ken Aleter）表示，哥伦比亚广播公司董事会可能会昨天甚至在董事会会议之前就将这些变化付诸实施。“董事会定期举行晚宴，前一天晚上举行非正式晚宴，这对于每月一次的董事会会议来说是正常的。怀曼取消了它，因为他觉得董事会在劳伦斯·蒂施和佩利之间的斗争中两极分化，一方面是托马斯·怀曼和他的支持者托马斯·怀曼和一些董事会成员。但董事会还是决定在没有蒂施、佩利或怀曼的情况下召开会议，而且他们显然开会到很晚，也就是周二晚上。然后在昨天的会议上， 怀曼按计划提交了一份预算，显然，董事会一致对该预算提交不满意。后来人们了解到，事实上，至少我是被告知，怀曼和其他与他结盟的人曾提出过试图出售公司的提议，试图找到一位白衣骑士来阻止劳伦斯·蒂施和比尔·佩利。” “怀曼在最后一刻扰乱？” “是的，最后，董事会要求蒂施和佩利离开，然后他们又要求怀曼离开。因此，当董事会进行讨论时，这部剧的三位主要演员都离开了房间，据我所知，一致认为是时候做出改变了。 ” “所以说劳伦斯·蒂施参加了那次会议并接管了会议，这不太公平。” “嗯，显然是董事会接管了会议。截至上周晚些时候，董事会已准备好支持汤姆·怀曼。过去几天发生的一些事情扭转了董事会的局面。我认为，部分原因是人们对怀曼的不满情绪日益强烈。我还怀疑，董事会可能认为，只有怀曼继续掌舵，媒体上持续的流血事件才会继续，他们必须阻止它。” “是的。让我在这里向您询问一个复杂问题的非常简单的答案。哥伦比亚广播公司陷入这样的麻烦是因为现在电视行业普遍存在的问题，还是因为哥伦比亚广播公司管理不善？” “两者都有。显然，所有网络都在发生同样的事情。他们面临着一个未来，至少是在不久的将来，收入不再以以前的速度增长，即每年 10%、12%、14%。所有三个网络的收入都在下降。 广告商正在寻找其他的渠道，更高效的渠道，更便宜的渠道。来自第四网络、技术和有线电视的新竞争。其次，人们有一种感觉，尽管怀曼在纸面上是一位优秀的经理，并且拥有良好的强大管理背景，但他并不是一位职能经理。电视上充斥着许多自负的名人。他们也是相当大的人才。但无论如何，这些自负需要一些抚慰。汤姆·怀曼不是一名击球手。他是一位循规蹈矩的经理。例如，他对哥伦比亚广播公司最重要的部门很陌生，不是产生最多金钱的部门，而是产生最大声望的部门，那就是新闻部门。 ” “正如你提到的，哥伦比亚广播公司新闻部的人最近已经不再抱有幻想了，他们可能会受到这一举动的鼓舞，但具体来说，他们在烦恼什么？他们是如何管理不善的？谁能告诉我？” “嗯，我想可能有一千个不同的故事。上周备受关注的一个故事是比尔·莫耶 (Bill Moyer) 的故事，它让人感觉哥伦比亚广播公司 (CBS) 的娱乐价值被奉为圭臬，而牺牲了新闻价值。然而，如果你回到爱德华·R·莫罗（Edward R.  +
Morrow），已故的圣人爱德华·R·莫罗（Edward R.  +
Morrow），他是一位出色的记者，但他也是一位有时奉行娱乐价值观的记者，例如，如果你回去看看他在一个名为“个人对个人”的节目中所做的个人对个人的采访，这是一种“哎呀，奇才，哦天哪，被邀请到你家真是太好了”之类的气氛，几乎没有什么硬新闻。 但我认为莫耶斯的抱怨表明哥伦比亚广播公司的情况是多么两极分化。”“肯·阿莱特。他是《华尔街的贪婪与荣耀》一书的作者，在纽约与我们交谈。”
