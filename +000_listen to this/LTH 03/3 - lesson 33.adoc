Lesson33


Britain apparently failed today in its efforts to persuade its European allies to take joint action against Syria for its alleged role in sponsoring international terrorism. But the US government insisted it was continuing to assess the situation and considering further actions. NPR's Elizabeth Colton reports." Here in Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman emphasized that the American action of withdrawing its Ambassador from Damascus represented a strong signal and was not at all a routine or normal procedure as the Syrian Foreign Minister described it yesterday. 'To define what we did, withdrawing one's ambassador is, in diplomatic terms, an extremely serious measure, a sign of great displeasure with a country's policies.' But Redman skirted the issue of why the US had not taken stronger action against Syria now as the American military did against Libya last April. 'We've often said in the past that we're not on some sort of automatic pilot in the case of any of these questions. And finally, that we're in the process of consulting with the British and our allies on what other steps may now be appropriate.' The State Department has sent the head of its anti-terrorism office, Ambassador Paul Bremmer, to London to coordinate any further Western action against Syria. I'm Elizabeth Colton in Washington." In Nicaragua today, former US Attorney General Griffin Bell proposed a prisoner swap to free American Eugene Hasenfus. Hasenfua is on trial in a people's tribunal for allegedly shipping supplies to contra rebel forces. Bell suggested trading Hasenfus for nineteen Nicaraguans held in US jails. All but one of the Nicaraguans is imprisoned on drug charges. Bell says he isn't sure the US or Nicaragua will accept the proposed deal. A former air force enlisted man has been arrested for allegedly trying to sell information to the Soviets. The Justice Department said today that Allen John Davies was arrested in San Francisco while trying to deliver the plans of an air force reconnaissance project to men he thought were Soviets. Davies faces up to life in jail if convicted. Today in Luxembourg, Britain pushed for sanctions against Syria. At a meeting of the European community, British Foreign Minister Sir Jeffrey Howe called for a collective response against Syria which Britain accuses of involvement in an attempted airline
bombing in London. From Luxembourg, the BBC's Clifford Smith reports. Sir Jeffrey Howe is not asking his European partners to do exactly as Britain did, for instance, to break off diplomatic relations with Syria. He is asking, however, for what he calls a clear collective response, something that will tell Syria that its behavior is unacceptable to all twelve. On this point, he seems to have found reluctance among at least some ministers. But he also seems to have been taking a very firm line. At one moment, he pointedly reminded the meeting that only last month he had called an emergency meeting of the twelve Ministers of the Interior at French request and that that meeting had not only declared solidarity with France against the terrorist bomb attacks in Paris, but had produced what he called 'useful and practical results.' Sir Jeffrey's implication was clear. France, he thinks, should not now be hanging back, but should help in getting similar results from this meeting in Luxembourg. The certain ideas which are said to be at the forefront of discussion here among the twelve have not yet been officially revealed. But there are indications they may include the banning or restriction of flights to or from Damascus and the reduction of embassy staffs. Against this, some Ministers are clearly putting the point that it would not be good for the prospects of Middle East peace to isolate Syria too much. Since everyone here agrees that Syria has a necessary role in that process. The BBC's Clifford Smith reporting from Luxembourg. News analyst Daniel Shore says that Britain's evidence linking Syria to the attempted bombing places the Reagan Administration in an uncomfortable situation. The Reagan Administration has been aware for months of the solid evidence that Syrian air force and intelligence organized Nezar Hindawi's attempt to blow up an El Al airliner with two hundred Americans among its three hundred and seventy-five passengers, apparently in revenge for Israel's forcing down of a Syrian plane in a search for terrorists. The case against Syria also includes the bombing of an Arab-German Friendship Club in Berlin and probable complicity in the Beirut bombing that killed two hundred and forty-one American marines. That case is at least as strong as the evidence of Colonel Quddafi's involvement in the Berlin Discotheque bombing last April, which led President Reagan to order a retaliatory bombing raid on Libya. The President, having said he would take similar action against Syria if a similar smoking gun were produced, faces the dilemma now that Britain has produced a smoking gun of how to orchestrate a response short of an attack on Syria that he has no intention of ordering. Syria raises problems that Libya did not. A sign from President Assad's ambiguous contribution to gaining freedom for hostages and his dubious role in the stagnant Middle East peace process: any use of force against Syrian territory would probably trigger a response from the Soviet Union under a treaty commitment. And an attack on a Syrian controlled Bekaa Valley, terrorist staging area in Lebanon, might jeopardize American hostages who are believed to be held in that area. And so, the administration seeks to divert attention from President Reagan's rhetoric of swift retribution, by allowing the issue to be framed by the European community in terms of verbal, diplomatic and, as an ultimate recourse, economic sanctions against Syria. The European controversy arrays Britain which provided bases for the American attack on Libya, against France,
which denied overflight rights. And yet the Reagan Administration has not even joined Britain in breaking relations with Syria, let alone pressing Europe for more vigorous action as it did in the case of Libya. The loud-mouthed Colonel Quddafi may talk more provocatively than the wily President Assad, but officials know that Syria has cost a lot more American lives. And yet, Syria is a different ball game offering America fewer safe options. But President Reagan might wish he had not made such unqualified promises of anti-terrorist reprisal. News analyst Daniel Shore. In London Jury deliberations begin tomorrow in the case of alleged Arab terrorist Nezar Hindawi. Today the judge gave his instructions to the jury. Hindawi, a Jordanian, has denied that he tried to blow up an Israeli airliner in April by planting explosives in his pregnant girl friend's luggage. Vera Frankle has a report. "During three days on the witness stand, Hindawi insisted that he believed the bag he gave Anne Murphy contained not explosives, but cocaine or heroin given him by the head of a drug syndicate in Syria. Hindawi told the jury the bag produced in court was not the one he gave his girlfriend, and he suggested the bag had been switched at the El Al check-in at Heathrow as part of a plot by Massad, the Israeli secret service to discredit Syria. Hindawi came across as an affable kind of man, often smiling and gesticulating as he gave his account. But what he said must have come as something of a surprise to the jury. They'd been told by the prosecution on the opening day of the trial that Hindawi had confessed to police that he'd come to London specifically to blow up the El Al plane on the instructions of senior intelligence officers he'd met in Damascus. In court, Hindawi said the confession was a fabrication. But the prosecution urged the jurors to look at the facts, and not to let any possible political repercussions of the case cloud their judgment. Hindawi carried a Syrian passport of a kind usually reserved for government officials. It was in a false name. He traveled to London from Damascus with a Syrian Arab airlines crew and planned to return to Syria with them hours after parting from Anne Murphy at Heathrow. He'd gone to the Syrian Embassy in London and met the Ambassador as soon as he heard the bomb had been found. Hindawi didn't dispute any of these facts, but he stuck firmly to the drug story. It didn't appear to cut much ice with the judge, however. In his summation, he drew the jury's attention to a list of names of contacts allegedly drawn up by Hindawi in custody. Among them was that of General Mohammed Alcooly, head of Syrian Air Force Intelligence who's described by sources in London as President Assad's closest advisor and head of Syria's National Security Council. How, the judge asked the jury, did those names get on that piece of paper? No doubt about it, that's his handwriting. The judge recalled the prosecution's point that if the El Al jumbo had blown up in mid-air, there would have been no evidence of Syrian involvement, or Hindawi's involvement either. It might have all worked out smoothly if Hindawi hadn't panicked when the explosives were found and fled to the Syrian Embassy. He would have been back in Syria within hours. The judge urged the jury not to rush their decision. Clearly, if the jury returns a verdict of 'guilty,' the British government will have to provide a speedy answer to the question that's been on
many minds throughout the three-week trial; what to do about Syria. Strong diplomatic action will be inevitable, because as one British commentator put it, 'Syria will stand more conclusively convicted of terrorism than Colonel Quddafi has ever been.'

今天，英国未能说服其欧洲盟友针对叙利亚涉嫌支持国际恐怖主义采取联合行动。但美国政府坚称正在继续评估局势并考虑采取进一步行动。美国国家公共广播电台的伊丽莎白·科尔顿报道。“在华盛顿，美国国务院发言人查尔斯·雷德曼强调，美国从大马士革撤回大使的行动代表了一个强烈的信号，根本不像叙利亚外长昨天所描述的那样是例行程序或正常程序。”定义我们所做的事情，从外交角度来说，撤回大使是一项极其严重的措施，是对一个国家的政策非常不满的表现。”但雷德曼回避了为什么美国现在没有像去年四月美国军方对利比亚采取的那样对叙利亚采取更强有力的行动。 “任何这些问题。最后，我们正在与英国和我们的盟友协商现在可能采取的其他适当措施。”美国国务院已派反恐办公室主任保罗·布雷默大使前往伦敦，协调西方针对叙利亚采取的进一步行动。我是华盛顿的伊丽莎白·科尔顿。今天在尼加拉瓜，美国前司法部长格里芬·贝尔提议进行囚犯交换，以释放美国人尤金·哈森福斯。哈森富阿因涉嫌向反叛军运送物资而在人民法庭接受审判。贝尔建议用哈森福斯交换被关押在美国监狱的十九名尼加拉瓜人。除一名尼加拉瓜人外，其他人均因毒品指控入狱。贝尔表示，他不确定美国或尼加拉瓜是否会接受拟议的协议。 一名前空军士兵因涉嫌试图向苏联出售信息而被捕。美国司法部今天表示，艾伦·约翰·戴维斯 (Allen John Davies) 在旧金山被捕，当时他试图向他认为是苏联人的人提供空军侦察项目的计划。如果罪名成立，戴维斯将面临终身监禁。今天在卢森堡，英国推动对叙利亚实施制裁。在欧洲共同体的一次会议上，英国外交大臣杰弗里·豪爵士呼吁对叙利亚采取集体反应，英国指责叙利亚参与了伦敦未遂的航空爆炸事件。英国广播公司 (BBC) 的克利福德·史密斯 (Clifford Smith) 在卢森堡报道。杰弗里·豪爵士并没有要求他的欧洲伙伴完全像英国那样，例如断绝与叙利亚的外交关系。然而，他要求做出他所谓的明确的集体反应，这将告诉叙利亚，其行为是所有十二国都无法接受的。在这一点上，他似乎发现至少有一些部长不太情愿。但他似乎也采取了非常坚定的立场。有一次，他尖锐地提醒会议，就在上个月，他才应法国的要求召开了十二位内政部长的紧急会议，这次会议不仅宣布声援法国反对巴黎恐怖爆炸袭击事件，而且产生了他所说的“有用且实际的结果”。杰弗里爵士的含义很明确。他认为，法国现在不应该犹豫不决，而应该帮助卢森堡这次会议取得类似的结果。据说这十二个人中处于讨论前沿的某些想法尚未正式透露。 但有迹象表明，这些措施可能包括禁止或限制往返大马士革的航班以及减少大使馆工作人员。对此，一些部长明确指出，过度孤立叙利亚不利于中东和平前景。因为这里的每个人都同意叙利亚在这一进程中发挥必要的作用。英国广播公司 (BBC) 克利福德·史密斯 (Clifford Smith) 来自卢森堡的报道。新闻分析师丹尼尔·肖尔表示，英国将叙利亚与未遂爆炸事件联系起来的证据让里根政府陷入了尴尬的境地。几个月来，里根政府一直知道有确凿的证据表明，叙利亚空军和情报部门组织内扎尔·欣达维 (Nezar Hindawi) 试图炸毁一架以色列航空公司客机，机上 375 名乘客中有 200 名美国人，显然是为了报复以色列强行击落飞机。一架叙利亚飞机正在搜寻恐怖分子。针对叙利亚的案件还包括柏林阿拉伯-德国友谊俱乐部的爆炸事件，以及可能参与造成 241 名美国海军陆战队员死亡的贝鲁特爆炸事件的同谋。该案至少与去年四月库扎菲上校参与柏林迪斯科舞厅爆炸事件的证据一样有力，这导致里根总统下令对利比亚进行报复性轰炸。总统曾表示，如果制造出类似的确凿证据，他将对叙利亚采取类似的行动，但现在英国已经制造出了确凿的证据，他面临着一个困境，即如何在不攻击叙利亚的情况下策划回应，而他无意下令攻击叙利亚。叙利亚提出了利比亚没有提出的问题。 阿萨德总统对人质获释做出的模糊贡献以及他在停滞不前的中东和平进程中扮演的可疑角色表明：对叙利亚领土使用任何武力都可能引发苏联根据条约承诺作出反应。对叙利亚控制的贝卡谷地（黎巴嫩的恐怖分子集结地）的袭击可能会危及据信被关押在该地区的美国人质。因此，美国政府试图转移人们对里根总统迅速报复言论的注意力，允许欧洲社会对叙利亚进行口头、外交以及作为最终手段的经济制裁来解决这个问题。欧洲的争议让英国为美国袭击利比亚提供了基地，而法国则拒绝拥有飞越权。然而，里根政府甚至没有与英国一起断绝与叙利亚的关系，更不用说像在利比亚问题上那样敦促欧洲采取更积极的行动了。大声喧哗的库扎菲上校的言论可能比狡猾的阿萨德总统更具挑衅性，但官员们知道，叙利亚造成的美国人伤亡要多得多。然而，叙利亚是一场不同的比赛，为美国提供的安全选择较少。但里根总统可能希望他没有做出如此无条件的反恐报复承诺。新闻分析师丹尼尔·肖尔。伦敦陪审团将于明天开始审议阿拉伯恐怖分子内扎尔·欣达维 (Nezar Hindawi) 案件。今天法官向陪审团发出了指示。约旦人欣达维否认自己四月份曾在怀孕女友的行李中放置炸药，试图炸毁一架以色列客机。维拉·弗兰克尔有一份报告。 “在证人席上的三天里，辛达维坚称他相信他给安妮·墨菲的袋子里没有炸药，而是叙利亚一个贩毒集团头目给他的可卡因或海洛因。辛达维告诉陪审团，法庭上出示的袋子是不是他送给女朋友的那个，他暗示这个包是在希思罗机场办理登机手续时被调换的，这是以色列特勤局马萨德阴谋的一部分，目的是抹黑叙利亚。辛达维给人的印象是一位和蔼可亲的人，在陈述自己的情况时经常微笑着并打手势。但他所说的话一定让陪审团感到惊讶。在审判开始当天，检方告诉他们，辛达维已向警方承认，他辛达维按照他在大马士革会见的高级情报官员的指示，专门来到伦敦炸毁以色列航空公司的飞机。欣达维在法庭上表示，这一供词是捏造的。但检方敦促陪审员审视事实，并且不要让该案任何可能的政治影响影响他们的判断。辛达维持有一本通常为政府官员保留的叙利亚护照。这是用假名。他与叙利亚阿拉伯航空公司的机组人员一起从大马士革飞往伦敦，并计划在希思罗机场与安妮·墨菲分手几小时后与他们一起返回叙利亚。当他听说炸弹被发现后，他立即前往叙利亚驻伦敦大使馆并会见了大使。辛达维没有对这些事实提出异议，但他坚定地坚持毒品的故事。然而，这似乎并没有与法官产生太大的分歧。在总结中，他提请陪审团注意一份据称由辛达维在押期间起草的联系人名单。 其中包括叙利亚空军情报局局长穆罕默德·阿尔库利将军，伦敦消息人士称他是阿萨德总统最亲密的顾问兼叙利亚国家安全委员会主席。法官问陪审团，这些名字是怎么写到那张纸上的？毫无疑问，那是他的笔迹。法官回顾了检方的观点，即如果埃尔阿尔巨型飞机在半空中爆炸，就不会有叙利亚参与的证据，也不会有辛达维参与的证据。如果辛达维没有在爆炸物被发现时惊慌失措并逃往叙利亚大使馆，事情可能会顺利进行。他将在几个小时内返回叙利亚。法官敦促陪审团不要仓促做出决定。显然，如果陪审团做出“有罪”判决，英国政府将必须迅速回答在为期三周的审判中许多人一直在思考的问题；叙利亚该怎么办。强有力的外交行动将是不可避免的，因为正如一位英国评论员所说，“叙利亚将比库扎菲上校更确凿地被判犯有恐怖主义罪。”我是国家公共广播电台的维拉·弗兰克尔，在伦敦。”
