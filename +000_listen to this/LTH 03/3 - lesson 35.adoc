He made a mistake.

[.my2]
他犯了一个错误。

Further, that `主` _the federal prosecutors_ 公诉人；检察官 /who *brought* the case *against* him /`谓` *were engaged in* a vendetta 积怨；宿怨；长期不和;家族世仇；团伙仇杀 /*to remove* (v.) the judge *from* the bench.

(Editor's note: There seems to be a mistake in the first news item.

[.my2]
（编者注：第一条新闻似乎有错误。

"More than half a decade" in the first sentence should be "more than half a century." Please compare "Section Two" and "Supplementary Reading.") The first impeachment proceeding in the United States Senate in fifty years began today, the trial of Federal Judge Harry E.

[.my2]
第一句中的“半个多世纪”应该是“半个多世纪”。请比较“第二节”和“补充阅读”。）美国参议院五十年来的首次弹劾程序今天开始，对联邦法官哈里·E·肯尼迪的审判。

Claiborne of Nevada.

[.my2]
内华达州的克莱伯恩。

Judge Claiborne is a convicted felon, now serving a prison term for income tax evasion.

[.my2]
克莱伯恩法官是一名被定罪的重罪犯，目前因逃税而正在监狱服刑。

He has refused to resign from the bench and has demanded a trial in the Senate, the only constitutional means of removing a federal judge from office.

[.my2]
他拒绝辞去法官职务，并要求在参议院进行审判，这是罢免联邦法官的唯一宪法手段。

NPR's Linda Wertheimer is following that trial.

[.my2]
NPR 的 Linda Wertheimer 正在关注该审判。

Early this morning, the presiding officer of the Senate, who was at that time Senator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa, summoned Senators to a historic occasion, a trial in the Senate.

[.my2]
今天清晨，参议院议长、当时的爱荷华州共和党参议员查尔斯·格拉斯利召集参议员参加一个历史性的时刻，即参议院的审判。

The Senate will now proceed, he said, as a court of impeachment.

[.my2]
他说，参议院现在将作为弹劾法庭进行审理。

"The Sergeant at Arms will make the proclamation." "All persons are commanded to keep silence, on pain of imprisonment while the House of Representatives is exhibiting the Senate of the United States articles of impeachment against Judge harry E.

[.my2]
“武装中士将宣布这一消息。” “在众议院向参议院展示针对哈里·E·肯尼迪法官的弹劾条款时，所有人都被要求保持沉默，否则将被监禁。

Claiborne." That was the Sergeant at Arms, Ernest Garcia, who then rang the bells for the Senators to appear for a live quorum.

[.my2]
克莱伯恩。” 那是武装中士欧内斯特·加西亚，他随后敲响了参议员们出席现场法定人数的钟声。

At least fifty-one members of the Senate must be present during this trial.

[.my2]
审判期间至少有五十一名参议院议员必须出席。

As the Senators filed in, they saw sitting at long tables in the well of the Senate the prosecution and the defense.

[.my2]
当参议员们鱼贯而入时，他们看到检方和辩方坐在参议院中间的长桌旁。

The prosecutors are members of the House who exhibit in the constitutional term the articles of impeachment to the Senate.

[.my2]
检察官是众议院议员，他们在宪法期限内向参议院展示弹劾条款。

The defense, Judge Claiborne and his attorneys, including a former Senator, Howard Cannon of Nevada.

[.my2]
辩方、克莱伯恩法官和他的律师，包括前参议员、内华达州的霍华德·坎农。

The two tables face the one hundred desks of the Senators who will serve as judge and jury in this trial.

[.my2]
这两张桌子面向将在本次审判中担任法官和陪审团的参议员的一百张桌子。

The attorney for the defense led off with some prefatory remarks.

[.my2]
辩护律师首先发表了一些序言。

Oscar Goodman told the Senate that Judge Claiborne insisted on this trial because he believes that he is innocent.

[.my2]
奥斯卡·古德曼告诉参议院，克莱伯恩法官坚持进行这次审判，因为他相信自己是无辜的。

But the center of the argument made by Judge Claiborne's attorney is that the judge was rail-roaded into prison by over enthusiastic prosecution.

[.my2]
但克莱伯恩法官的律师提出的论点的核心是，这位法官是因过度热情的起诉而入狱的。

"He has been caught in the vortex of a constitutional crisis, a situation that has to affect every member of this body, because, God forbid, it could happen to them where Judge Claiborne became victimized as a result of a vendetta of the Justice Department, and the strike force, and a special agent in charge of the FBI who came to the Nevada desert to bury the American flag there." Attorney Goodman's charge was answered in prefatory remarks again by Congressman Henry Hide of Illinois, a member of the House, in effect acting for the prosecution.

[.my2]
“他陷入了宪法危机的漩涡，这种情况必须影响到这个机构的每个成员，因为，上帝禁止，克莱伯恩法官因司法部的仇杀而成为受害者的情况可能发生在他们身上，还有突击队，还有一名负责联邦调查局的特工，他们来到内华达沙漠埋葬美国国旗。”众议院议员、伊利诺伊州众议员亨利·海德（Henry Hide）在序言中再次回应了古德曼律师的指控，他实际上代表检方。

"Judge Claiborne isn't here because of any alleged misconduct by the government.

[.my2]
“克莱伯恩法官因政府涉嫌不当行为而缺席。

He's here because he was tried and convicted beyond a reasonable doubt given the presumption of innocence by a jury of twelve people.

[.my2]
他来这里是因为考虑到十二人陪审团推定无罪，他受到了毫无合理怀疑的审判和定罪。

His motion for a new trial was denied, his appeal to the ninth circuit was denied, his motion for rehearing and ban was denied, and his Writ of Certiorari to the Supreme Court was denied.

[.my2]
他要求重新审判的动议被驳回，他向第九巡回法院提出的上诉被驳回，他的重审和禁令动议被驳回，他向最高法院提交的调卷令状也被驳回。

That's why he's here." Judge Claiborne was convicted of income tax evasion, willfully filing false returns which failed to report hundreds of thousands of dollars of income.

[.my2]
这就是他来这里的原因。”克莱伯恩法官被判犯有逃税罪，故意提交虚假申报表，未报告数十万美元的收入。

Claiborne's defense is that he make a mistake but did not commit a crime, and further the prosecutors pursued of a vendetta against him.

[.my2]
克莱伯恩的辩护是，他犯了错误，但没有犯罪，并进一步追究检察官对他的仇杀。

Members of the House argued that whatever the prosecutors' conduct, it is Claiborne who is on trial in the Senate.

[.my2]
众议院议员辩称，无论检察官的行为如何，克莱伯恩在参议院接受审判。

Congressman Peter Rodino, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee argued that Judge Claiborne's contention that he made a mistake is simply not credible.

[.my2]
众议院司法委员会主席、国会议员彼得·罗迪诺认为，克莱伯恩法官关于他犯了错误的说法根本不可信。

"According to Judge Claiborne, an individual can hire the most incompetent tax preparer, participate in the most irresponsible treatment of basic tax concepts, create sales of assets that do not exist, fail even to bother to read the return, enjoy a refund of thousands of dollars, and simply wait for an audit." Late in the day, Judge Claiborne spoke in his own defense.

[.my2]
“根据克莱伯恩法官的说法，个人可以雇用最无能的报税员，参与对基本税务概念最不负责任的处理，出售不存在的资产，甚至懒得阅读申报表，享受数千美元的退款美元，只需等待审计即可。”当天晚些时候，克莱伯恩法官为自己辩护。

"I wanted to talk to you." He said to the Senators.

[.my2]
“我想和你谈谈。”他对参议员们说。

"I wanted you to see me.

[.my2]
“我想让你见我。

I feel," he said, "like a piece of meat torn between two dogs." "I want to be honest with every member of this body.

[.my2]
我感觉，”他说，“就像一块肉在两只狗之间撕扯。”“我想对这个机构的每个成员诚实。

I would much rather, right today, be almost any place than here.

[.my2]
今天，我宁愿去任何一个地方，而不是在这里。

But I knew when I was convicted that this was the place that I had to come." Claiborne told the Senate that young Turks in the Justice Department are head hunters looking for prosecutions which will gain them the most publicity.

[.my2]
但当我被定罪时，我知道这是我必须来的地方。”克莱伯恩告诉参议院，司法部的年轻土耳其人是猎头者，他们正在寻找起诉，这将为他们赢得最大的知名度。

The Senate is deciding now in closed session what to do about the articles of impeachment against Judge Claiborne.

[.my2]
参议院现在正在闭门会议上决定如何处理针对克莱伯恩法官的弹劾条款。

Impeachment requires a two-thirds votes of the members present.

[.my2]
弹劾需要出席议员三分之二票通过。

I'm Linda Wertheimer at the Capitol.

[.my2]
我是国会大厦的琳达·韦特海默。

Most information on the movement of nuclear weapons in this country is classified for reasons of security.

[.my2]
出于安全原因，有关该国核武器流动的大多数信息都是保密的。

But some new details are becoming public that suggest that the transporting of nuclear weapons for maintenance and production is much more frequent than is generally known.

[.my2]
但一些新的细节正在公开，表明用于维护和生产的核武器的运输比人们普遍知道的要频繁得多。

NPR's David Malthus reports that on any given day, it is likely that US nuclear weapons are being transported on the nation's highways, in the air, and at sea.

[.my2]
美国国家公共广播电台的大卫·马尔萨斯报道说，在任何一天，美国的核武器都可能在国家的高速公路、空中和海上运输。

America's nuclear arsenal is constantly in flux.

[.my2]
美国的核武库不断变化。

Older warheads are retired and dismantled as new ones are built.

[.my2]
旧弹头随着新弹头的建造而退役和拆除。

Some elements of nuclear bombs, like radio active tritium becomes stale over time and must be refurbished.

[.my2]
核弹的某些元素，如放射性氚，随着时间的推移会变得陈旧，必须翻新。

There are changes in storage sites, quality control checks.

[.my2]
储存地点、质量控制检查都有变化。

This routine maintenance and production requires frequent movement of nuclear weapons and components.

[.my2]
这种日常维护和生产需要核武器及其部件的频繁移动。

It is accomplished through a large transportation network that includes specially designated cargo planes of the Air Force, freighters under the control of the Navy, and a fleet of highway tractor trailer rigs operated by the Department of Energy.

[.my2]
它是通过大型运输网络来实现的，其中包括空军专门指定的货机、海军控制下的货机以及能源部运营的公路牵引车拖车车队。

DOE, which oversees the production, assembly, and testing of nuclear weapons, has forty-five custom-built trucks to transport the weapons to more than one hundred military installations in twenty-two states.

[.my2]
美国能源部负责监督核武器的生产、组装和测试，拥有 45 辆定制卡车，用于将武器运输到 22 个州的 100 多个军事设施。

Headquarters for the transport operations is Albuquerque, New Mexico.

[.my2]
运输业务总部位于新墨西哥州阿尔伯克基。

Department spokesman Ben McCarty says the truck fleet logs over four million miles a year hauling their special cargo.

[.my2]
该部门发言人本·麦卡蒂表示，卡车车队每年运输特殊货物的里程超过四百万英里。

"They'll be carrying nuclear weapons, special nuclear materials, such as plutonium or highly enriched uranium and classified non-nuclear components of nuclear weapons." Once delivered to military storage facilities, the weapons often are then transported by air or ship to bases around the world.

[.my2]
“它们将携带核武器、特殊核材料，例如钚或高浓缩铀以及核武器的机密非核部件。”一旦运送到军事储存设施，这些武器通常会通过空运或海运运往世界各地的基地。

The military, following standard practice, refuses to discuss its nuclear transportation operations.

[.my2]
按照标准做法，军方拒绝讨论其核运输业务。

However, the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal research group based in Washington, has used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain military documents on those operations.

[.my2]
然而，总部位于华盛顿的自由主义研究团体政策研究所已利用《信息自由法》获取有关这些行动的军事文件。

They were made available to NPR.

[.my2]
它们已向 NPR 公开。

Air Force Memoranda state that nuclear weapons are transported, "almost on a daily basis." The military airlift command refers to these missions as "the bully beef express." The Air Force documents show that last year the bully beef crews flew more than a thousand nuclear weapons flights.

[.my2]
空军备忘录指出，核武器的运输“几乎每天都有”。军事空运司令部将这些任务称为“霸道牛肉快递”。空军文件显示，去年霸牛航空机组人员进行了一千多次核武器飞行。

Recently, the Navy revealed, perhaps inadvertently, in public documents, information that indicates some of its nuclear weapons are ferried across the Atlantic in commercial cargo ships operated by civilians.

[.my2]
最近，美国海军可能无意地在公开文件中披露了一些信息，表明其一些核武器是通过民用商业货船运送到大西洋彼岸的。

The ships reportedly carry a small contingent of Navy personnel for security and communications, but it appears that the freighters rely heavily on their anonymity for security.

[.my2]
据报道，这些船只载有一小队海军人员用于安全和通信，但货船似乎严重依赖他们的匿名性来保证安全。

William Arkin of the Institute for Policy Studies has done intensive research on the transportation of nuclear weapons.

[.my2]
政策研究所的威廉·阿金对核武器的运输进行了深入研究。

"We live with the illusion that nuclear weapons are safely secured away, all in underground missile silos in South Dakota and Montana and Wyoming.

[.my2]
“我们抱有这样的幻想：核武器被安全地存放在南达科他州、蒙大拿州和怀俄明州的地下导弹发射井中。

And instead, we see a system which requires constant care and feeding, repair, constant movement, which comes into contact with the soldiers and civilian technicians on a daily basis." Arkin points out that each year, several thousand military and civilian personnel handling nuclear weapons are permanently disqualified for such duty because of alcohol abuse, use of illegal drugs, and other personal problems.

[.my2]
相反，我们看到的是一个需要不断护理、供给、维修、不断移动的系统，它每天都会与士兵和文职技术人员接触。”阿尔金指出，每年都有数千名军事和文职人员处理核问题。由于酗酒、使用非法药物和其他个人问题，武器永久丧失履行此类职责的资格。

But defense officials say this is a sign of the military's diligence, not danger.

[.my2]
但国防官员表示，这是军方勤奋的表现，而不是危险。

Of the one hundred thousand nuclear weapons handlers, about thirty-three hundred lost their clearances last year.

[.my2]
去年，在十万名核武器处理者中，约有三千三百人失去了许可。

The most disqualified in any recent year has been five thousand.

[.my2]
近年来被取消资格最多的有五千人。

But human and mechanical failures have caused serious problems in the past.

[.my2]
但过去，人为和机械故障曾造成严重问题。

The Defense Department says there have been thirty-two accidents involving nuclear weapons, the last one in 1980.

[.my2]
国防部表示，已发生 32 起涉及核武器的事故，最后一次发生在 1980 年。

At least ten caused leakage of radioactive materials.

[.my2]
至少有十起造成放射性物质泄漏。

None has caused a nuclear explosion.

[.my2]
没有一次引起核爆炸。

Spokesman Ben McCarty of the Department of Energy says nuclear weapons trucks have been involved in eleven accidents over the years, mainly from icy roads which caused the trucks to flip over.

[.my2]
美国能源部发言人本·麦卡蒂表示，多年来，核武器卡车已发生 11 起事故，主要是由于道路结冰导致卡车翻车。

But he says there's never been any danger to the public.

[.my2]
但他表示，公众从未遇到过任何危险。

"We have never had an accident that resulted in a release of radio-activity from one of these trucks or in any damage to the cargo in these trucks." Air Force documents show that pilots transporting nuclear weapons today are told to avoid flying over heavily populated areas to the maximum extent possible.

[.my2]
“我们从未发生过导致其中一辆卡车释放放射性或对这些卡车中的货物造成任何损坏的事故。”空军文件显示，如今运输核武器的飞行员被告知要尽可能避免飞越人口稠密的地区。

General D.H.  D.H.将军

Cassidy of the Military Airlift Command praised the "bully beef express" for its outstanding safety record in an internal memo last year.

[.my2]
军事空运司令部的卡西迪在去年的一份内部备忘录中赞扬了“霸王牛肉快递”出色的安全记录。

But he also warned the crews about complacency after Air Force personnel mentioned on a non-secure telephone the nature of the cargo on two nuclear weapons flight.

[.my2]
但他也警告机组人员不要自满，因为空军人员在非安全电话中提到了两架核武器航班上货物的性质。

Military Airlift Command Regulation No.

[.my2]
军事空运指挥条例第 1 号

55-141 tells the crews how to respond to a hijacking attempt.

[.my2]
55-141 告诉机组人员如何应对劫机企图。

"Never allow a hostile force to capture or control a nuclear weapon," it says, "even if it means risking the lives of any hostages that might have been taken." The regulation instructs the crews on when to use CDS—the command disable system, which is attached to some nuclear weapons.

[.my2]
报告称：“绝不允许敌对势力夺取或控制核武器，即使这意味着冒着可能被劫持的人质生命危险。”该规定指导机组人员何时使用 CDS——一些核武器上附带的命令禁用系统。

"CDS," the regulation says, "internally destroys the capability of a weapon to achieve a significant nuclear yield." "As a last resort," the regulation says, "nuclear weapons must be destroyed even if it means loss of the aircraft.

[.my2]
该法规称，“CDS 从内部摧毁了武器实现显着核当量的能力。”该规定称：“作为最后的手段，核武器必须被销毁，即使这意味着飞机的损失。”

The department of Energy says it too takes great precautions against accidents or terrorist attacks.

[.my2]
能源部表示，它也采取了严格的预防措施来防止事故或恐怖袭击。

Spokesman Ben McCarty says the trucks that haul nuclear weapons across the country have armor-plated cabs.

[.my2]
发言人本·麦卡蒂表示，在全国范围内运输核武器的卡车都配有装甲驾驶室。

The drivers are trained and equipped with a number of firearms, and the trucks are escorted by additional armed guards in cars.

[.my2]
司机经过培训并配备了多种枪支，卡车上还有额外的武装警卫护送。

Ben McMarty, "We know where all the trucks are at all times, and we have both voice and data links to them.

[.my2]
Ben McMarty，“我们随时知道所有卡车的位置，并且我们有与它们的语音和数据链接。

And should anything happen to the shipments, the escort vehicles are able to communicate immediately with local or state law enforcement people and the full force of the military establishment should it be required." While the Department of Energy tries to keep these shipments secret, peace groups have penetrated that secrecy repeatedly.

[.my2]
如果货物发生任何情况，护送车辆能够立即与当地或州执法人员以及军事机构的全部力量进行联系（如果需要）。”虽然能源部试图对这些货物保密，但和平一些团体已多次突破这一秘密。

One group, Nuke Watch, has followed the nuclear trucks thousands of miles over the last two years.

[.my2]
Nuke Watch 组织在过去两年里追踪了核卡车数千英里。

Other anti-nuke activists line the roadsides and wave banners, alerting highway travellers that nuclear weapons are on the way.

[.my2]
其他反核武器活动人士在路边排列并挥舞横幅，警告公路旅行者核武器即将来临。

Sam Day, the founder of Nuke Watch says the trucks are not difficult to spot even though they are unmarked, with no warning of hazardous cargo.

[.my2]
Nuke Watch 的创始人 Sam Day 表示，这些卡车并不难被发现，尽管它们没有标记，也没有危险货物的警告。

"The trucks are eighteen wheel semi-trailers.

[.my2]
“这些卡车是十八轮半挂车。

They look a lot like the hundreds of thousands of other semis on the road.

[.my2]
它们看起来很像路上的数十万其他半挂车。

The trailers are metal colored.

[.my2]
拖车是金属色的。

They have peculiar radio antenna above the cab, which is the main way that you recognize them as H-bomb trucks." "When they spot you, do they take evasive action, try to lose you?" "They used to, yes.

[.my2]
他们的驾驶室上方有特殊的无线电天线，这是你认出他们是氢弹卡车的主要方式。” “当他们发现你时，他们会采取回避行动，试图失去你吗？” “他们曾经这样做过，是的。

They used to speed up to eighty-five miles an hour, make hairpin turns and generally play cowboy with us." Sam Day says now that the Energy Department knows who they are, the truck drivers no longer go out of their way to evade the Nuke Watch shadow.

[.my2]
他们过去常常加速到每小时八十五英里，急转弯，通常和我们一起玩牛仔。”萨姆·戴说，现在能源部知道他们是谁，卡车司机不再特意躲避核弹手表的影子。

The Department's Ben McMarty says Nuke Watch is more of a nuisance than anything else.

[.my2]
该部门的本·麦克马蒂 (Ben McMarty) 表示，Nuke Watch 比其他任何东西都更令人讨厌。

"The job of driving these rigs and protecting these rigs is in itself somewhat stressful.

[.my2]
“驾驶这些钻机和保护这些钻机的工作本身就有些压力。

These guys have to really, you know, at all times be on the lookout for anything unusual or any suspicious vehicles coming up on them, or things like this.

[.my2]
你知道，这些人必须时刻警惕任何异常情况或任何可疑车辆出现在他们身上，或者类似的事情。

And it adds to their stress load." The peace groups say they are not out to harass the truck convoys.

[.my2]
这增加了他们的压力。”和平组织表示，他们并不是要骚扰卡车车队。

Their purpose is to emotionalize the arms control issue.

[.my2]
他们的目的是使军备控制问题情绪化。

Says Nuke Watch Sam Day, "We want to bring home to people the fact that nuclear weapons are rolling through the streets and towns of America regularly." I'm David Malthus in Washington.

[.my2]
Nuke Watch Sam Day 表示：“我们希望让人们了解核武器经常在美国的街道和城镇中滚过的事实。”我是华盛顿的大卫·马尔萨斯。
