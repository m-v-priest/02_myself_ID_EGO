The House began debate today on a three-year bill to combat trafficking and use of illegal drugs.  +
The measure has the support of most representatives and House Speaker Thomas O'Neill says he expects it to pass by tomorrow.  +
Among other things, the bill would increase penalties for violators, provide money to increase drug enforcement and coast guard personnel, and require drug producing countries to establish eradication programs as a condition of US support for development loans.  +
A cultural exchange between the US and the Soviet Union may face an American boycott unless US News and World Report correspondent, Nicholas Daniloff, is freed from a Moscow jail.  +
An American style town meeting is scheduled to take place in Latvia next week, but the two hundred seventy Americans due to take part say they won't go if Daniloff remains in jail.  +
They add the decision is a personal one and is not being made by the Reagan Administration in retaliation for the Daniloff detention.  +
Egyptian and Israeli negotiators have reached agreement on resolving the Taba border dispute, clearing the way for a summit between the two countries to begin tomorrow.  +
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres will meet in Alexandria.  +
Details of the Taba agreement have not been made available.  +
The United States House of Representatives is debating an omnibus drug bill and expects to pass the measure tomorrow.  +
Though the bill has attracted strong bipartisan support, NPR's Cokey Roberts reports the debate on the issue points up the differences between political parties.  +
When Congress returned from the Fourth of July recess, House Speaker Tip O'Neill
said there was only one thing members were talking about in the cloak-room: drugs.  +
The Democrats quickly pulled together chairmen from twelve different committees to draft a drug package.  +
Then, stung by criticism that they were acting in a partisan fashion, the Democratic leaders invited the Republicans to join them in the newly declared war on drugs.  +
So, when the bill came to the House floor today, the party leaders led off debate.  +
Texas Democrat Jim Wright.  +
"It's time to declare an all-out war, to mobilize our forces, public and private, national and local, in a total coordinated assault upon this menace, which is draining our economy of some two hundred and thirty billion dollars this year, slowly rotting away the fabric of our society, seducing and killing our young.  +
That it will take money is hardly debatable.  +
We can't fight artillery with spitballs." The question of just how much money this measure will cost has not been answered to the satisfaction of all members.  +
Democrats say it's one and half billion dollars over three years, with almost seven hundred thousand for next year.  +
Republicans claim the price tag will run higher and are trying to emphasize other aspects of the drug battle, aspects which they think play better in Republican campaigns.  +
Minority leader Robert Michel.  +
"The ultimate cure for the drug epidemic must come from within the heart of each individual faced with the temptation of taking drugs.  +
It is ultimately a problem of character, of will power, of family and community, and concern, and personal pride." Among other items, the bill before the House increases penalties for most drug related crimes, sets the minimum jail term of twenty years for drug trafficking and manufacturing, authorizes money for the drug enforcement administration and prison construction, beefs up the ability of the coast guard and customs service to stop drugs coming into this country, and creates programs for drug education.  +
The various sections of the measure give House members ample opportunity to speak on an issue where they want their voices heard.  +
Maryland Democratic Barbara McCulsky was nominated for the Senate yesterday.  +
Today, she spoke to the part of the bill which funds drug eradication programs in foreign countries.  +
"When we fought yellow fever, we didn't go at it one mosquito at a time.  +
We went right to the swamp.  +
That's what the Foreign Affairs section of this legislation will do.  +
It will go to the swamps, or where cocaine is either grown, refined, or manufactured." Republican Henson Moore is running for the Senate in Louisiana.  +
He spoke to the part of the drug bill which changes the trade laws for countries which deal in drugs.  +
"We're moving to stop something; it's absolutely idiotic.  +
It needs to be stopped: this situation of where a country can sell legally to us on the one hand and illegally to us under the table, selling drugs in this country poisoning our young people and our population." Today in China, in Nanjing, balloons, firecrackers and lion dancers mark the dedication of the Johns Hopkins University—Nanjing University Center for Chinese and American Studies.  +
For the first time since World War II, Chinese and American
students will attend a graduate institution in China that is administered jointly by academic organizations that are worlds apart figuratively and literally.  +
NPR's Susan Stanberg reports.  +
Cross-cultural encounters can be extremely enriching; cross-cultural encounters can be utterly absurd.  +
"Let's see.  +
That would be eighty-seven.  +
So, ...  +
ba-shi-qi-nian-qian, ...  +
let's see, ...  +
equal ...  +
proposition equal, ..." Here's what that American was trying to say in Chinese.  +
"Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation ...  +
a new nation conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal." Now you don't have to be dealing with classic American oratory to run into problems.  +
In planning for the Center for Chinese and American Studies, there was much debate as to whether the new auditorium on the Nanjing campus should have a flat or sloped floor.  +
If the floor were flat, the auditorium could be used for dances, for parties, but a sloped floor would be better for listening, for viewing films and slides.  +
"The argument finally won out that for practical reasons a flat floor would be best because it ...  +
it really would make it a multi-purpose room.  +
You wouldn't have to fix the furniture." Stephen Muller is President of Johns Hopkins University, the US end of this Sino-American joint venture in learning.  +
"So, a flat floor was built.  +
Only the Chinese in building it finally ended up with a flat floor but at two different levels, one higher than the other.  +
So, if you want to use it for dances, you either have to have very short women with very tall men or vice versa." Twenty-four Americans and thirty-six Chinese of mixed heights are the first students at the Hopkins-Nanjing Center.  +
Nanjing used to be Nanking, by the way, back in the days when Beijing was Peking.  +
The Americans will take classes in Chinese history, economics, trade, politics, all from Chinese faculty.  +
The Chinese will study the US with American university professors.  +
Johns Hopkins President Stephen Muller says this is advanced study work.  +
All the Chinese students are proficient in English; all the Americans have master's degrees plus fluency in Chinese.  +
"The twenty-four Americans come from about eighteen colleges and universities.  +
No one institution in this country produces that many people of this character; so that's a beginning.  +
Nanjing is not the place; the Center is not the place to go, if you want a doctorate in Chinese history or Chinese language or Chinese literature or whatever.  +
This is a pre-professional program." Which means the men and women who spend the year at the Nanjing Center will end up as diplomats or business people in one another's country.  +
"Our hope is that the Americans, to speak about those, who are going to be incidentally rooming with Chinese roommates, which is a very interesting thing the Chinese agree to, that the Americans will not only bring a year of living in China, a year of having studied with Chinese faculty and hearing the Chinese view of Chinese foreign policy in economics and so on, that they will also have the kind of friends
among Chinese roughly their age who are going to be dealing with the United States.  +
That will slowly, over the years, create a real network, if you will, if people who, because they've had this common experience, can deal with each other very easily and, you know, be kind of a rallying point—an old boy, old girl network, as it were." Hopkins President Muller admits that a simple exchange program—Chinese students coming to the US, and American students going to China—would involve far fewer headaches than running jointly an academic institution on foreign soil.  +
Plus the success of the Hopkins-Nanjing Center depends on undependables, like continuing sweet Sino-American relations and being able to attract funding.  +
And there's this wrinkle." "Some of the people who will study there, without any question, will probably come from or afterwards enter the intelligence community.  +
That it's really desirable that people who do that have that kind of background.  +
We're very honest about that, but it's so easy to denounce the whole thing as an espionage center, or something.  +
You know, there's a lot of fragility in this thing." Stephen Muller is President of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.  +
The Hopkins-Nanjing University Center for Chinese and American Studies was dedicated today in China.  +
I'm Susan Stanberg.  +
"How do you say good luck in Chinese?" "Don't know.  +
I don't know Chinese." "You'd better learn." "That's a phrase I should know.  +
Yes."



众议院今天开始辩论一项为期三年的法案，以打击贩运和使用非法毒品。该措施得到了大多数代表的支持，众议院议长托马斯·奥尼尔表示，他预计该措施将于明天通过。除其他外，该法案将加大对违法者的处罚力度，提供资金增加禁毒执法和海岸警卫队人员，并要求毒品生产国制定根除计划，作为美国支持发展贷款的条件。除非《美国新闻与世界报道》记者尼古拉斯·达尼洛夫从莫斯科监狱获释，否则美国和苏联之间的文化交流可能会面临美国的抵制。一场美国式的城镇会议定于下周在拉脱维亚举行，但预定参加的 270 名美国人表示，如果达尼洛夫仍被关在监狱里，他们就不会参加。他们补充说，这一决定是个人决定，并不是里根政府为了报复丹尼洛夫被拘留而做出的。埃及和以色列谈判代表就解决塔巴边界争端达成协议，为明天两国举行峰会扫清了道路。埃及总统穆巴拉克和以色列总理西蒙·佩雷斯将在亚历山大举行会晤。塔巴协议的细节尚未公布。美国众议院正在讨论一项综合药物法案，预计将于明天通过该法案。尽管该法案吸引了两党的大力支持，但美国国家公共广播电台 (NPR) 的科基·罗伯茨 (Cokey Roberts) 报道称，有关该问题的辩论凸显了政党之间的分歧。当国会从国庆节休会回来时，众议院议长蒂普·奥尼尔表示，议员们在衣帽间里只讨论一件事：毒品。 民主党迅速召集了十二个不同委员会的主席起草一份药品方案。然后，由于批评他们的党派行为，民主党领导人邀请共和党加入他们新发起的禁毒战争。因此，当该法案今天提交众议院时，党派领导人引发了辩论。德克萨斯州民主党人吉姆·赖特。 “现在是宣战的时候了，动员我们的公共和私人、国家和地方力量，对这种威胁进行全面协调的攻击，这种威胁今年正在缓慢地消耗我们约 2300 亿美元的经济。腐烂我们社会的结构，引诱和杀害我们的年轻人。这需要金钱几乎是无可争议的。我们不能用纸团来对抗大炮。”这项措施到底要花多少钱的问题尚未得到令所有成员满意的答案。民主党人表示，三年内将投入 1.5 亿美元，明年将投入近 70 万美元。共和党人声称价格标签将会更高，并试图强调毒品斗争的其他方面，他们认为这些方面在共和党竞选中发挥得更好。少数党领袖罗伯特·米歇尔。 “毒品泛滥的最终治愈方法必须来自于每个面临吸毒诱惑的人的内心。这最终是一个性格、意志力、家庭和社区、关心和个人自豪感的问题。除其他事项外，众议院提交的法案增加了对大多数与毒品有关的犯罪的处罚，规定贩毒和制造毒品的最低刑期为二十年，授权为缉毒管理和监狱建设提供资金，增强沿海地区的能力警卫和海关部门阻止毒品进入这个国家，并制定毒品教育计划。该措施的各个部分为众议院议员提供了充分的机会就他们希望听到自己声音的问题发表意见。马里兰州民主党人芭芭拉·麦库斯基被提名为参议院昨天。今天，她就该法案中资助外国根除毒品计划的部分发表了讲话。“当我们抗击黄热病时，我们并没有一次只对付一只蚊子。”我们径直走到沼泽地。这就是该立法的外交部分将要做的事情。 ” 共和党人汉森摩尔正在路易斯安那州竞选参议员。他谈到了毒品法案中改变毒品交易国家贸易法的部分。 “我们正在采取行动阻止某些事情；这绝对是愚蠢的。这种情况需要制止：一个国家一方面可以合法地向我们出售毒品，另一方面可以在私底下非法向我们出售毒品，在这个国家出售毒品，毒害我们的年轻人和人民。”今天在中国，在南京，气球、鞭炮和舞狮标志着约翰·霍普金斯大学—南京大学中美研究中心的落成。这些组织在象征意义上和字面意义上是截然不同的。 NPR 的苏珊·斯坦伯格报道。跨文化的接触可以极其丰富；跨文化的遭遇可能是完全荒谬的。 “让我们看看。那就是八十七。所以，...​八十七年-钱，...​让我们看看，...​等于...​命题等于，...​”这就是那个美国人想说的中国人。 “二十七年前，我们的父辈在这片大陆上建立了一个新国家……一个在自由中孕育的新国家，致力于人人生而平等的主张。”现在，您不必处理经典的美国演讲也会遇到问题。在中美研究中心的规划过程中，关于南京校区的新礼堂应该采用平坦还是倾斜的地板存在很多争论。如果地板是平的，礼堂可以用来跳舞、聚会，但倾斜的地板更适合聆听、观看电影和幻灯片。 “这场争论最终胜出，出于实际原因，平坦的地板是最好的，因为它……​它真的可以使它成为一个多功能房间。你不必修理家具。”斯蒂芬·穆勒是美国约翰·霍普金斯大学校长，曾在这家中美合资企业学习。 “所以，建造了一个平坦的地板。只有中国人最终建造了一个平坦的地板，但有两个不同的高度，一个比另一个高。所以，如果你想用它来跳舞，你要么必须有非常矮的女性和非常高的男性，反之亦然。”霍普金斯南京中心的第一批学生是二十四名美国人和三十六名不同身高的中国人。顺便说一下，南京曾经是南京，早在北京还是北平的时候。美国人将学习中国历史、经济、贸易、政治等课程，所有课程均由中国教师授课。 中国人将与美国大学教授一起学习美国。约翰·霍普金斯大学校长斯蒂芬·穆勒表示，这是一项高级研究工作。所有中国学生都精通英语；所有美国人都拥有硕士学位并且中文流利。 “这二十四名美国人来自大约十八所学院和大学。这个国家没有任何一个机构能培养出这么多这种性格的人；所以这只是一个开始。南京不是那个地方；中心也不是你该去的地方，如果你想要获得中国历史、中国语言、中国文学等方面的博士学位。这是一个专业预科课程。”这意味着在南京中心度过一年的男男女女最终将成为彼此国家的外交官或商人。 “我们希望美国人，谈到那些偶然与中国室友同住的人，这是中国人同意的一件非常有趣的事情，美国人不仅会带来在中国生活的一年，在与中国教师一起学习并听取了中国人对中国在经济等方面的外交政策的看法之后，他们也将在与他们年龄相仿的中国人中拥有那种将要与美国打交道的朋友。多年来，创建一个真正的网络，如果你愿意的话，如果人们因为有这种共同的经历，可以很容易地彼此打交道，并且，你知道，成为一个集结点——一个老男孩，可以说是老女孩网络。”霍普金斯大学校长穆勒承认，一个简单的交换项目——中国学生来美国，美国学生去中国——比在外国土地上联合运营一个学术机构要少得多。 此外，霍普金斯大学南京中心的成功取决于一些不可靠的因素，比如持续良好的中美关系和吸引资金的能力。这就是一个问题。” “毫无疑问，一些在那里学习的人可能来自情报界或后来进入情报界。这样做的人有这样的背景是非常可取的。我们对此很诚实，但很容易将整个事件谴责为间谍中心或其他什么。你知道，这件事有很多脆弱性。”斯蒂芬·穆勒是巴尔的摩约翰·霍普金斯大学校长。霍普金斯-南京大学中美研究中心今天在中国落成。我是苏珊·斯坦伯格。“你用中文说祝你好运？” “不知道。我不懂中文。” “你最好学学。” “这是我应该知道的一句话。是的。”
