Lesson31


Mozambique's President Samora Machel has been killed in a plane crash on South Africa's eastern border.  +

Machel and twenty-eight others died in the crash during a thunderstorm last night.  +

Ten survived.  +

They were returning home from a weekend summit of African leaders in Zambia.  +

Machel was fifty-three.  +

He led Mozambique to independence and had been President since 1975.  +

General Motors announced today it is selling its assets in South Africa.  +

G.M.  +

Chairman Roger Smith said the recession in South Africa and a lack of progress in ending apartheid has created what he called an increasingly difficult business environment.  +

Smith said GM South African operations had been losing money for several years.  +

GM's Opel and Isuzu subsidiaries will be sold to a group headed by local South African management.  +

The Reagan Administration today reacted angrily to the Soviet expulsion of five American diplomats from the Soviet Union yesterday.  +

NPR's Jim Angle has details.  +

"White Home spokesman Larry Speakes called it an unjustified action based on unfounded allegations.  +

'We are upset, outraged, and chagrined,' he said.  +

At the State Department, spokesman Charles Redman said the US has made its views of the expulsions clear to Soviet officials in Moscow.  +

'We did protest that action.  +

In doing so, we made the point that this action is totally without justification and cannot help but have a detrimental effect on our relations.' Administration officials said the expulsion was clearly a retaliation for the US expulsion of twenty-five diplomats at the Soviet mission to the UN.  +

That was part of a three-year reduction in the Soviet UN staff demanded by the administration.  +

Officials would not comment on whether the five Americans were intelligence officers, but insist that they had done nothing improper, meaning they were not caught in any act of espionage.  +

Some administration officials believe this is a test of wills between the US and the Soviet Union over what kind of intelligence presence each side will allow.  +

'In any case,' said one official, 'the Soviet action is illegitimate and shouldn't go without a response.' I'm Jim Angle in
Washington." The citizens of the troubled African nation of Mozambique are in shock tonight and waiting to hear who will be leading their country in the coming months.  +

The leader of that southern African country Samora Machel died last night as his plane apparently attempted a crash landing inside South Africa just half a mile from the Mozambican border.  +

Twenty-eight others also died in the crash.  +

The death of Machel and the location of the crash have raised serious questions about South Africa's possible role in the crash, and about the future stability of the region.  +

NPR's John Madison has more from Johannesburg.  +

President Machel died within a few minutes drive from the place that he and South African President P.W.  +

Botha made famous, Nkomati, the village that gave its name to a historic nonaggression pact between the white minority government and its black Marxist neighbor in 1984.  +

twenty-eight people are believed to have died in the crash last night.  +

Only ten survived; all but one are in serious condition.  +

Bodies were strewn around the plateau on which the President's jet appears to have tried to make a forced landing.  +

In the wreckage, only the tail of the fuselage is identifiable as the remains of an airplane.  +

Most of the dead were senior members of Machel's government, and one was Zaire's Ambassador to Mozambique.  +

With news of the crash, suspicion was immediately cast on South Africa.  +

The war of words between the two has escalated in recent weeks bringing relations to an all-time low since the Nkomati Accord was signed two years ago.  +

The timing of the tragedy could hardly have been worse for regional stability.  +

The past two weeks have seen escalating South Africa charges and threats against Mozambique.  +

On October 6, a land mine exploded in South Africa near the border, injuring six South African soldiers.  +

Two days later South Africa's Defense Minister warned Machel that South Africa would fight with everything at its disposal.  +

He pointedly said Machel held the fate of Nkomati Accord in his hands.  +

Then ten days ago, South Africa announced it was barring Mozambique's sixty-three thousand workers from South Africa, thus cutting off Mozambique's main supply of foreign exchange.  +

South Africa's outlawed African National Congress today blamed South Africa for being directly of indirectly responsible for the crash.  +

They pointed out that South Africa has backed the Mozambique resistance movement of Ronomo, which was currently conducting a military offense against the Mozambique government.  +

They said either South Africa or Renamo caused the crash.  +

Renamo, for its part, denied this responsibility but made no bones about its pleasure at Machel's demise.  +

"The death of President Machel removes the main obstacle to peace," a spokesman for Ronomo in Lisbon said.  +

"And he was personally running a war against us.  +

We are happy to hear of his death." The anti-apartheid United Democratic Party Front spokesman Murphy Moroby said the South African government would have to prove it was not involved.  +

The South African government says international investigators are welcome to assist in the investigation.  +

Whatever caused the crash, leaders in the region are scrambling to understand its consequences.  +

Machel was a charismatic leader, who brought his
country to independence in 1975.  +

And there is no obvious successor.  +

Mozambique is one of the weakest of South Africa's immediate neighbors.  +

And there are questions about whether Machel's ruling party FRELIMO can remain in power without him.  +

In New York City's Lincoln Center this week, applause and just a few boos for this year's New York Film Festival.  +

In its twenty-four year history, the festival has played host to the American premiers of such films as The Last Picture Show , Last Tango in Paris and Chariots of Fire .  +

It has also given an exposure to hundreds of foreign and low-budget movies which might otherwise have gone unnoticed in this country.  +

This year's schedule includes both obscure films and movies which seem destined for commercial success.  +

Film critic Bob Mondello has been in attendance this week and he says, "A more accurate title for the event might have been 'the New York Film Critics' Festival.'" "Critics don't usually travel in packs.  +

There are three hundred of us at this thing, and everybody is watching the film at once.  +

And it's a kind of strange to be hearing them reacting as human beings rather than seeing these things in individuals screenings." "Do the critics then get to talk with the people who actually made the film? Is that the point of the festival?" "Well, that's kind of it.  +

I think the most interesting thing should be those interviews afterwards.  +

But critics are not, by nature, social beings sometimes.  +

And when they're sitting down in a large group, you kind of ...  +

you're torn between wanting to ask some probing questions and ask something really silly.  +

And sometimes the questions they ask are very strange.  +

For instance, David Burn of Talking Heads, the rock group, has made a movie called True Stories .  +

Now, it's his first picture.  +

He might conceivably have some interesting things to say about music and movies.  +

He might conceivable have some interesting things to say about being a newcomer to movie-making.  +

But for some reason, someone asked him about a scene where some of his actors get dipped in chocolate.  +

So he ended up doing a couple of minutes on something that's not really his field, a substance called bentonite." "It has the chemical consistency of chocolate, but it's a lot cheaper and it'll flow without being heated up.  +

So you don't scald yourself when you jump into it.  +

It's a curious liqueur that was ...  +

They use if they pump it down into ...  +

when they drill for oil, and it brings up the loose grave and things, because it's heavier than rock.  +

It's also used to thicken the filling in jelly donuts." "Now, that's probably more than you ever thought you'd want to know about that particular aspect of film-making." "It's nice to have that technical not.  +

David Burn had the film When Talking Had Stopping Making Sense ,the documentary, a couple of years ago.  +

He had a lot to do with the production of that.  +

Does this one, which apparently is a feature film, does it work? What are the reviews?" "Well, I'm not ...  +

the film hasn't actually opened anywhere yet.  +

We're ...  +

the critics saw it the other day.  +

It's pretty good.  +

It's kind of a goofy picture.  +

It's set in a small
town called Burgell, Texas, which doesn't actually exist.  +

And they're having a celebration of specialness.  +

And I think only David Burn would come up with ideas like having a fashion show that features a suit made out of Astroturf which is kind of fun." "How many films at the Festival?" "There are twenty-four and a bunch of shorts.  +

Actually, the only thing I saw that got hissed ...  +

the audience reaction when you're sitting with a lot of critics can be very interesting, and everyone hissed one called Girls in Suits , which was a sort of My Dinner with Andre , I guess you could call it.  +

It was two women talking about their affairs for twenty minutes, and it was excruciating, I thought." "One of the films at the festival I'm looking forward to seeing when it comes around the country is Round Midnight , a film done with saxophone player Dexter Gordon, an American who's been living in Paris for many years." "Yea, and it's likely to be the real toast of the Festival.  +

It's the one thing about which no one can think of anything negative to say.  +

It is a beautiful motion picture.  +

It's made by Bertrand Tavernier, who is just an extraordinary film-maker.  +

And in this particular instance, it's, you know, Dexter Gordon's first film role, his first acting role, really.  +

And he's ...  +

it's very interesting to see him.  +

I mean he hasn't ...  +

You're used to hearing him play the saxophone, but you've almost never heard him speak.  +

Let's just play a clip from it, so that you have some idea.  +

He's a saxophonist who is killing himself with drink.  +

And this is sort of the morning after one of those days.  +

—Never, never again, man.  +

Don't cry for me.  +

Never again, Franz.  +

—What else can I do when you are killing yourself? —I'll stop.  +

—Stop? —I promise.  +

—Al, you never stopped before.  +

—I never promised anybody before.  +

"What's really interesting is seeing him in person too, because while he's talking—he was there at a press conference afterwards—and while he's talking, he moves his fingers in the air as if he were fingering his instrument.  +

It's fascinating thing, because he's clearly improvising his answers, and he also does that sometimes in the film.  +

It's, it's just fascinating to see.  +

I think that's one of the reasons that the Festival is so interesting if you're a critic." "So Round Midnight looks good.  +

Also rare reviews so far for the Kathleen Turner film Peggie Sue Got Married , which will close, I understand the Festival on Sunday.  +

Can you tell us from what you've seen there, are the next few months of American movie-going going to be worthwhile?" "Oh, boy.  +

I wish I could tell from just the films at the Festival.  +

If only ...  +

you see, a lot of these are not terribly commercial pictures.  +

The ones that are, like Peggie Sue Got Married —I think that's going to be a hit in the same sort of way that The Big Chill , which opened the festival a couple of years ago, was.  +

And there are a few others like that, like Menage by Bertrand Blier which looks to be a big foreign film, and Sid and Nancy has a commercial chance.  +

That's about Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols.  +

So there's a possibility.  +

It's really hard to judge from a film festival, though.  +

These are not, for
the most part, which you call mainstream films.  +

As a matter of fact, that's the point of having them in the festival—to try and give them a chance with the public and get the awareness up." "But a few great winners to see, anyway.  +

Thanks, Bob Mondello, talking with us in New York."



莫桑比克总统萨莫拉·马谢尔在南非东部边境的一次飞机失事中丧生。马歇尔和其他二十八人在昨晚的雷暴雨事故中丧生。十人幸存。他们刚刚结束在赞比亚举行的非洲领导人周末峰会回国。马谢尔五十三岁。他领导莫桑比克获得独立，并自 1975 年起担任总统。通用汽车今天宣布将出售其在南非的资产。总经理董事长罗杰·史密斯表示，南非的经济衰退和结束种族隔离方面缺乏进展造成了他所说的日益困难的商业环境。史密斯表示，通用汽车南非业务多年来一直亏损。通用汽车的欧宝和五十铃子公司将出售给由南非当地管理层领导的集团。里根政府今天对苏联昨天驱逐五名美国外交官表示愤怒。 NPR 的 Jim Angle 提供了详细信息。 “白宫发言人拉里·斯皮克斯 (Larry Speakes) 称这是基于毫无根据的指控的不公正行动。他说，‘我们感到不安、愤怒和懊恼。’国务院发言人查尔斯·雷德曼 (Charles Redman) 表示，美国已向他们明确表达了对驱逐行动的看法。莫斯科的苏联官员说：“我们确实对这一行动提出了抗议。在这样做时，我们表明这一行动完全没有道理，而且只能对我们的关系产生有害影响。”政府官员表示，此次驱逐显然是对美国驱逐苏联驻联合国代表团25名外交官的报复。这是政府要求的三年削减苏联联合国工作人员的一部分。 官员们不愿评论这五名美国人是否是情报人员，但坚称他们没有任何不当行为，这意味着他们没有被抓到任何间谍活动。一些政府官员认为，这是美国和苏联之间对双方允许何种情报存在的意愿考验。一位官员表示，“无论如何，苏联的行动都是非法的，不应该没有回应。”我是华盛顿的吉姆·安格尔。”陷入困境的非洲国家莫桑比克的公民今晚感到震惊，等待着谁将在未来几个月领导他们的国家。这个南部非洲国家的领导人萨莫拉·马谢尔昨晚去世了。他的飞机显然试图在距莫桑比克边境仅半英里的南非境内迫降。另外 28 人也在坠机事件中丧生。马谢尔的死亡和坠机地点引发了人们对南非在这场危机中可能扮演的角色的严重质疑。事故以及该地区未来的稳定。美国国家公共广播电台 (NPR) 的约翰·麦迪逊 (John Madison) 报道了约翰内斯堡的更多情况。马谢尔 (Machel) 总统在距离他和南非总统 P.W.  +

博塔 (P.W.  +

Botha) 扬名的地方恩科马蒂 (Nkomati) 几分钟车程内去世，恩科马蒂 (Nkomati) 村由此得名。 1984 年，白人少数政府与其黑人马克思主义邻国签订了历史性的互不侵犯条约。据信，昨晚的空难中有 28 人死亡。只有 10 人幸存；除一人外，所有人均情况危急。总统专机似乎试图迫降的高原周围散布着尸体。残骸中，仅机身尾部可辨认为飞机残骸。 大多数死者是马谢尔政府的高级成员，其中一名是扎伊尔驻莫桑比克大使。坠机事件的消息传出后，南非立即受到怀疑。最近几周，两国之间的口水战不断升级，使两国关系跌至两年前签署《恩科马蒂协议》以来的历史最低点。对于地区稳定来说，这场悲剧发生的时机再糟糕不过了。过去两周，南非对莫桑比克的指控和威胁不断升级。 10月6日，南非边境附近一枚地雷爆炸，造成6名南非士兵受伤。两天后，南非国防部长警告马谢尔，南非将竭尽全力进行战斗。他尖锐地表示，马谢尔掌握着恩科马蒂协议的命运。十天前，南非又宣布禁止莫桑比克的六万三千名工人进入南非，从而切断了莫桑比克的主要外汇供应。南非被取缔的非洲人国民大会今天指责南非对这起事故负有直接或间接责任。他们指出，南非支持莫桑比克罗诺莫抵抗运动，该运动目前正在对莫桑比克政府进行军事进攻。他们说南非或抵抗运动造成了这次坠机。抵抗运动则否认了这一责任，但毫不掩饰对马谢尔的去世感到高兴。 “马谢尔总统的去世消除了和平的主要障碍，”罗诺莫在里斯本的发言人说。 “他亲自对我们发动战争。我们很高兴听到他的死讯。”反种族隔离联合民主党阵线发言人墨菲·莫罗比表示，南非政府必须证明自己没有参与其中。 南非政府表示欢迎国际调查人员协助调查。无论坠机原因是什么，该地区领导人都在努力了解其后果。马谢尔是一位富有魅力的领导人，他于 1975 年带领国家走向独立。而且没有明显的继任者。莫桑比克是南非近邻中最弱的国家之一。人们还质疑马谢尔领导的执政党解阵能否在没有他的情况下继续执政。我是约翰内斯堡的约翰·麦迪逊。本周，在纽约市的林肯中心，今年的纽约电影节响起了掌声和几声嘘声。在其二十四年的历史中，该电影节曾举办过《最后一场电影秀》、《巴黎最后的探戈》和《烈火战车》等电影的美国首映式。它还让数百部外国和低成本电影得以曝光，否则这些电影在这个国家可能会被忽视。今年的片单既有不起眼的电影，也有似乎注定会取得商业成功的电影。影评人鲍勃·蒙德罗本周出席了活动，他说：“该活动更准确的名称可能是‘纽约影评人节’。”“影评人通常不会成群结队地旅行。有三百名影评人“我们所有人都在看这部电影，每个人都在同时观看这部电影。听到他们像人类一样做出反应，而不是在个人放映中看到这些东西，这有点奇怪。” “然后影评人会与真正制作这部电影的人交谈吗？这就是电影节的意义吗？” “嗯，就是这样。我想最有趣的应该是事后的那些采访。但批评家有时本质上并不是社会人。 当他们坐在一大群人中时，你会有点……你在想问一些探究性问题和问一些非常愚蠢的问题之间左右为难。有时他们问的问题很奇怪。例如，摇滚乐队 Talking Heads 的 David Burn 制作了一部名为《真实故事》的电影。现在，这是他的第一张照片。可以想象，他可能有一些关于音乐和电影的有趣的事情要说。作为一个电影制作新手，他可能会说一些有趣的话。但出于某种原因，有人向他询问了他的一些演员浸入巧克力的场景。所以他最后花了几分钟研究了一种不属于他的领域的东西，一种叫做膨润土的物质。”“它具有巧克力的化学稠度，但它便宜得多，而且无需加热即可流动。这样你跳进去的时候就不会烫伤自己。这是一种奇怪的利口酒，...​当他们钻探石油时，如果他们将其泵入...​，它会带来松散的坟墓之类的东西，因为它比岩石重。它还可以用来使果冻甜甜圈的馅料变稠。”“现在，这可能比你想象的更想了解电影制作的这个特定方面。”“没有这种技术真是太好了。几年前，大卫·伯恩拍摄了一部纪录片《当谈话不再有意义时》。他与这部作品的制作有很大关系。这显然是一部故事片，它有效吗？评论是什么？”“嗯，我不是……这部电影实际上还没有在任何地方上映。我们……评论家前几天看到了它。这个很不错。这是一幅愚蠢的画面。故事发生在德克萨斯州一个名叫布尔格尔的小镇，但实际上这个小镇并不存在。他们正在庆祝特殊性。 我想只有 David Burn 才会想出这样的主意，比如举办一场时装秀，展示一套由 Astroturf 制成的套装，这很有趣。” “电影节有多少部电影？” “有二十四部，还有一堆。短裤。事实上，我看到的唯一一件事是发出嘶嘶声……当你和很多评论家坐在一起时，观众的反应可能非常有趣，每个人都对一部叫做《穿西装的女孩》发出嘶嘶声，这是一种《我与安德烈的晚餐》，我我猜你可以这么称呼它。两个女人谈论她们的风流韵事长达二十分钟，我想这太令人痛苦了。”“电影节上我期待在全国上映的电影之一是《午夜午夜》，一部萨克斯管演奏家德克斯特·戈登 (Dexter Gordon)，一位在巴黎生活多年的美国人。” “是的，这可能是音乐节真正的祝酒词。这是一件没有人能想到可以说任何负面的话的事情。这是一部美丽的电影。它的制作者是伯特兰·塔维尼尔 (Bertrand Tavernier)，他是一位非凡的电影制作人。在这个特殊的例子中，这是，你知道，德克斯特·戈登的第一个电影角色，他的第一个表演角色，真的。他……看到他很有趣。我的意思是他没有……​你习惯听他吹萨克斯管，但你几乎从未听过他说话。让我们播放其中的一个片段，以便您有所了解。他是一名萨克斯管演奏家，正在酗酒自杀。这是那些日子过后的第二天早上。 ——再也不会，再也不会了，伙计。别为我哭泣。再也不会了，弗兰茨。 ——当你自杀的时候我还能做什么？ ——我会停下来。 -停止？ -我保证。 ——艾尔，你以前从来没有停止过。 ——我以前从未向任何人承诺过。 “真正有趣的是亲自见到他，因为当他说话时——他后来参加了新闻发布会——当他说话时，他在空中移动手指，就像在弹奏他的乐器一样。这是一件很有趣的事情，因为“他显然是在即兴创作自己的答案，有时在电影中他也会这样做。这真是令人着迷。我认为，如果你是一名评论家，这就是电影节如此有趣的原因之一。” “午夜之夜看起来不错。到目前为止，凯瑟琳·特纳的电影《佩吉·苏结婚了》的评论也很少见，该片即将闭幕，我知道周日的电影节。你能从你在那里看到的情况告诉我们，接下来的几个月是怎样的吗？”去美国看电影值得吗？” “哦，天哪。我希望我能从电影节上的电影中看出这一点。如果……​你看，其中很多都不是非常商业化的电影。那些像《佩吉·苏结婚了》这样的电影——我认为这会发生像几年前为电影节开幕的《大寒》一样大受欢迎。还有其他几部类似的影片，比如 Bertrand Blier 的《Menage》，看起来像是一部大型外国电影， 《席德和南希》有商业机会。这就是性手枪乐队的《席德·维瑟斯》。所以有这种可能性。不过，从电影节上来判断真的很难。在大多数情况下，这些电影都不是所谓的主流电影。事实上，这就是让他们参加音乐节的目的——尝试给他们一个与公众接触的机会，并提高人们的认识。” “但无论如何，还是有一些伟大的获胜者值得一看。谢谢鲍勃·蒙德罗，在纽约与我们交谈。”
