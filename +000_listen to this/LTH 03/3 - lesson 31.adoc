[.my2]
在此过程中，我们表明这一行为毫无道理，只能对我们的关系产生有害影响。政府官员表示，此次驱逐显然是对美国驱逐苏联驻联合国代表团 25 名外交官的报复。

In New York City’s Lincoln Center this week, applause and just a few boos for this year’s New York Film Festival.

[.my2]
本周，在纽约市的林肯中心，今年的纽约电影节响起了掌声和几声嘘声。

In its twenty-four year history, the festival has played host to the American premiers of such films as The Last Picture Show , Last Tango in Paris and Chariots of Fire .

[.my2]
在其二十四年的历史中，该电影节曾举办过《最后一场电影秀》、《巴黎最后的探戈》和《烈火战车》等电影的美国首映式。

It has also given an exposure to hundreds of foreign and low-budget movies which might otherwise have gone unnoticed in this country.

[.my2]
它还让数百部外国和低成本电影得以曝光，否则这些电影在这个国家可能会被忽视。

This year’s schedule includes both obscure films and movies which seem destined for commercial success.

[.my2]
今年的片单既有不起眼的电影，也有似乎注定会取得商业成功的电影。

Film critic Bob Mondello has been in attendance this week and he says, "A more accurate title for the event might have been 'the New York Film Critics' Festival.'" "Critics don’t usually travel in packs.

[.my2]
电影评论家鲍勃·蒙德罗本周出席了活动，他说：“更准确的活动名称可能是‘纽约影评人节’。”“影评人通常不会成群结队地旅行。

There are three hundred of us at this thing, and everybody is watching the film at once.

[.my2]
我们有三百人参加这个活动，每个人都在同时观看这部电影。

And it’s a kind of strange to be hearing them reacting as human beings rather than seeing these things in individuals screenings." "Do the critics then get to talk with the people who actually made the film? Is that the point of the festival?" "Well, that’s kind of it.

[.my2]
听到他们像人类一样做出反应，而不是在个人放映中看到这些东西，这有点奇怪。”“评论家会和真正制作这部电影的人交谈吗？这就是节日的意义吗？” “嗯，就是这样。

I think the most interesting thing should be those interviews afterwards.

[.my2]
我想最有趣的应该是事后的那些采访。

But critics are not, by nature, social beings sometimes.

[.my2]
但批评者有时本质上并不是社会人。

And when they’re sitting down in a large group, you kind of …​

[.my2]
当他们坐在一大群人中时，你有点……​

you’re torn between wanting to ask some probing questions and ask something really silly.

[.my2]
你在想问一些探究性问题和问一些非常愚蠢的问题之间左右为难。

And sometimes the questions they ask are very strange.

[.my2]
有时他们问的问题很奇怪。

For instance, David Burn of Talking Heads, the rock group, has made a movie called True Stories .

[.my2]
例如，摇滚乐队 Talking Heads 的 David Burn 制作了一部名为《真实故事》的电影。

Now, it’s his first picture.

[.my2]
现在，这是他的第一张照片。

He might conceivably have some interesting things to say about music and movies.

[.my2]
可以想象，他可能有一些关于音乐和电影的有趣的事情要说。

He might conceivable have some interesting things to say about being a newcomer to movie-making.

[.my2]
作为一个电影制作新手，他可能会说一些有趣的话。

But for some reason, someone asked him about a scene where some of his actors get dipped in chocolate.

[.my2]
但出于某种原因，有人向他询问了他的一些演员浸入巧克力的场景。

So he ended up doing a couple of minutes on something that’s not really his field, a substance called bentonite." "It has the chemical consistency of chocolate, but it’s a lot cheaper and it’ll flow without being heated up.

[.my2]
所以他最后花了几分钟研究了一种不属于他的领域的东西，一种叫做膨润土的物质。”“它具有巧克力的化学稠度，但它便宜得多，而且无需加热即可流动。

So you don’t scald yourself when you jump into it.

[.my2]
这样你跳进去的时候就不会烫伤自己。

It’s a curious liqueur that was …​

[.my2]
这是一种奇怪的利口酒……​

They use if they pump it down into …​

[.my2]
如果他们将其泵入……​

when they drill for oil, and it brings up the loose grave and things, because it’s heavier than rock.

[.my2]
当他们钻探石油时，它会带来松散的坟墓之类的东西，因为它比岩石重。

It’s also used to thicken the filling in jelly donuts." "Now, that’s probably more than you ever thought you’d want to know about that particular aspect of film-making." "It’s nice to have that technical not.

[.my2]
它还可以用来使果冻甜甜圈的馅料变稠。”“现在，这可能比你想象的更想了解电影制作的这个特定方面。”“没有这种技术真是太好了。

David Burn had the film When Talking Had Stopping Making Sense ,the documentary, a couple of years ago.

[.my2]
几年前，大卫·伯恩拍摄了一部纪录片《当谈话不再有意义时》。

He had a lot to do with the production of that.

[.my2]
他与这部作品的制作有很大关系。

Does this one, which apparently is a feature film, does it work? What are the reviews?" "Well, I’m not …​

[.my2]
这显然是一部故事片，它有效吗？评论是什么？”“嗯，我不是……​

the film hasn’t actually opened anywhere yet.

[.my2]
这部电影实际上还没有在任何地方上映。

We’re …​

[.my2]
我们是……​

the critics saw it the other day.

[.my2]
批评家前几天看到了这一点。

It’s pretty good.

[.my2]
这个很不错。

It’s kind of a goofy picture.

[.my2]
这是一幅愚蠢的画面。

It’s set in a small town called Burgell, Texas, which doesn’t actually exist.

[.my2]
故事发生在德克萨斯州一个名叫布尔格尔的小镇，但实际上这个小镇并不存在。

And they’re having a celebration of specialness.

[.my2]
他们正在庆祝特殊性。

And I think only David Burn would come up with ideas like having a fashion show that features a suit made out of Astroturf which is kind of fun." "How many films at the Festival?" "There are twenty-four and a bunch of shorts.

[.my2]
我想只有 David Burn 才会想出这样的主意，比如举办一场时装秀，展示一套由 Astroturf 制成的套装，这很有趣。” “电影节有多少部电影？” “有二十四部，还有一堆。短裤。

Actually, the only thing I saw that got hissed …​

[.my2]
事实上，我看到的唯一一个发出嘶嘶声的东西......​

the audience reaction when you’re sitting with a lot of critics can be very interesting, and everyone hissed one called Girls in Suits , which was a sort of My Dinner with Andre , I guess you could call it.

[.my2]
当你和很多评论家坐在一起时，观众的反应可能会非常有趣，每个人都对《穿西装的女孩》发出嘶嘶声，这有点像《我与安德烈的晚餐》，我想你可以称之为它。

It was two women talking about their affairs for twenty minutes, and it was excruciating, I thought." "One of the films at the festival I’m looking forward to seeing when it comes around the country is Round Midnight , a film done with saxophone player Dexter Gordon, an American who’s been living in Paris for many years." "Yea, and it’s likely to be the real toast of the Festival.

[.my2]
两个女人谈论她们的风流韵事长达二十分钟，我想这太令人痛苦了。”“电影节上我期待在全国上映的电影之一是《午夜午夜》，一部萨克斯管演奏家德克斯特·戈登 (Dexter Gordon)，一位在巴黎生活多年的美国人。” “是的，这可能是音乐节真正的祝酒词。

It’s the one thing about which no one can think of anything negative to say.

[.my2]
这是一件没有人能想到可以说任何负面的话的事情。

It is a beautiful motion picture.

[.my2]
这是一部美丽的电影。

It’s made by Bertrand Tavernier, who is just an extraordinary film-maker.

[.my2]
它的制作者是伯特兰·塔维尼尔 (Bertrand Tavernier)，他是一位非凡的电影制作人。

And in this particular instance, it’s, you know, Dexter Gordon’s first film role, his first acting role, really.

[.my2]
在这个特殊的例子中，这是，你知道，德克斯特·戈登的第一个电影角色，他的第一个表演角色，真的。

And he’s …​

[.my2]
他是……​

it’s very interesting to see him.

[.my2]
见到他很有趣。

I mean he hasn’t …​

[.my2]
我的意思是他没有……​

You’re used to hearing him play the saxophone, but you’ve almost never heard him speak.

[.my2]
你习惯听他吹萨克斯，但你几乎从未听过他说话。

Let’s just play a clip from it, so that you have some idea.

[.my2]
让我们播放其中的一个片段，以便您有所了解。

He’s a saxophonist who is killing himself with drink.

[.my2]
他是一名萨克斯管演奏家，正在酗酒自杀。

And this is sort of the morning after one of those days.

[.my2]
这是那些日子过后的第二天早上。

—Never, never again, man.

[.my2]
——再也不会，再也不会了，伙计。

Don’t cry for me.

[.my2]
别为我哭泣。

Never again, Franz.

[.my2]
再也不会了，弗兰茨。

—What else can I do when you are killing yourself? —I’ll stop.

[.my2]
——当你自杀的时候我还能做什么？ ——我会停下来。

—Stop? —I promise.

[.my2]
-停止？ -我保证。

—Al, you never stopped before.

[.my2]
——艾尔，你以前从来没有停止过。

—I never promised anybody before.

[.my2]
——我以前从未向任何人承诺过。

"What’s really interesting is seeing him in person too, because while he’s talking—he was there at a press conference afterwards—and while he’s talking, he moves his fingers in the air as if he were fingering his instrument.

[.my2]
“真正有趣的是亲自见到他，因为当他说话时——他后来参加了新闻发布会——当他说话时，他在空中移动手指，就像在弹奏他的乐器一样。

It’s fascinating thing, because he’s clearly improvising his answers, and he also does that sometimes in the film.

[.my2]
这是一件很有趣的事情，因为他显然是在即兴创作他的答案，而且他有时在电影中也会这样做。

It’s, it’s just fascinating to see.

[.my2]
是的，这真是令人着迷。

I think that’s one of the reasons that the Festival is so interesting if you’re a critic." "So Round Midnight looks good.

[.my2]
如果你是一名评论家，我认为这就是音乐节如此有趣的原因之一。”“所以《午夜午夜》看起来不错。

Also rare reviews so far for the Kathleen Turner film Peggie Sue Got Married , which will close, I understand the Festival on Sunday.

[.my2]
迄今为止，凯瑟琳·特纳的电影《佩吉·苏结婚了》的评论也很少见，该片即将结束，我知道周日的电影节。

Can you tell us from what you’ve seen there, are the next few months of American movie-going going to be worthwhile?" "Oh, boy.

[.my2]
你能从你在那里看到的情况告诉我们，接下来几个月的美国电影值得吗？”“哦，孩子。

I wish I could tell from just the films at the Festival.

[.my2]
我希望我能从电影节上的电影中看出这一点。

If only …​

[.my2]
如果只是……​

you see, a lot of these are not terribly commercial pictures.

[.my2]
你看，其中很多都不是非常商业化的图片。

The ones that are, like Peggie Sue Got Married —I think that’s going to be a hit in the same sort of way that The Big Chill , which opened the festival a couple of years ago, was.

[.my2]
像《佩吉·苏结婚了》这样的电影，我认为它会像几年前为电影节开幕的《大寒》一样大受欢迎。

And there are a few others like that, like Menage by Bertrand Blier which looks to be a big foreign film, and Sid and Nancy has a commercial chance.

[.my2]
还有其他几部类似的影片，比如 Bertrand Blier 的《Menage》，看起来是一部大型外国电影，《席德和南希》有商业机会。

That’s about Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols.

[.my2]
这就是性手枪乐队的席德·维瑟斯 (Sid Vicious) 的故事。

So there’s a possibility.

[.my2]
所以有这样的可能性。

It’s really hard to judge from a film festival, though.

[.my2]
不过，从电影节的角度来判断确实很难。

These are not, for the most part, which you call mainstream films.

[.my2]
这些电影在很大程度上并不是所谓的主流电影。

As a matter of fact, that’s the point of having them in the festival—to try and give them a chance with the public and get the awareness up." "But a few great winners to see, anyway.

[.my2]
事实上，这就是让他们参加电影节的目的——尝试给他们一个与公众接触的机会并提高人们的认识。”“但无论如何，还是有一些伟大的获奖者值得一看。

Thanks, Bob Mondello, talking with us in New York."

[.my2]
谢谢鲍勃·蒙德罗在纽约与我们交谈。”
