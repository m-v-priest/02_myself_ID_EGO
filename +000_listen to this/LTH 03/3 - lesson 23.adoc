Soviet officials have confirmed that a crippled nuclear submarine sank in the Atlantic early today.
苏联官员证实，一艘受损的核潜艇今天早些时候在大西洋沉没。

US officials believe the sub carried at least sixteen nuclear missiles.
美国官员相信该潜艇至少携带十六枚核导弹。

Explosion and fire on the vessel last Friday killed three crewmen.
上周五船上发生爆炸和火灾，导致三名船员死亡。

The rest of the crew was successfully evacuated before the vessel sank.
其余船员在船只沉没前成功撤离。

Soviet officials say no radiation leaked in the air or the ocean.
苏联官员表示，没有辐射泄漏到空气或海洋中。

It’s unclear what may have caused the explosion that led to the sinking. A news agency in Beirut released a videotape today with pleas from three Frenchmen held for more than a year by the Islamic Jihad.
目前还不清楚是什么原因导致了爆炸并导致沉没。贝鲁特一家新闻机构今天发布了一段录像带，其中收录了被伊斯兰圣战组织关押一年多的三名法国人的请求。

Each hostage called on the French government to change its policy in the Middle East.
每名人质都呼吁法国政府改变其中东政策。

Melody Walker reports from Paris.
梅洛迪·沃克从巴黎报道。

"During the twenty-eight-minute recording, the three hostages criticized the French government for failing to gain their release, and said they had the impression they were being forgotten.
“在二十八分钟的录音中，三名人质批评法国政府未能释放他们，并表示他们有一种被遗忘的感觉。

Taking turns reading prepared texts, the two diplomats and one journalist looked physically exhausted and emaciated.
两名外交官和一名记者轮流朗读准备好的文本，看上去疲惫不堪、憔悴不堪。

Declaring that he was at the end of his rope, one of the hostages said that the government forgot about the remaining hostages after the release of two Frenchmen in June.
其中一名人质宣称自己已经束手无策，他说政府在六月释放两名法国人后就忘记了剩下的人质。

A total of seven French citizens are currently held hostage in Lebanon.
目前共有七名法国公民在黎巴嫩被扣为人质。

A communiqué from the Islamic Jihad which accompanied the video cassette calls on France to negotiate the release of seventeen Shi’ite prisoners jailed in Kuwait.
录像带随附的伊斯兰圣战组织公报呼吁法国就释放被关押在科威特的 17 名什叶派囚犯进行谈判。

The French Minister for Foreign Affairs did not comment on the content of the video cassette or the demands, but said tonight that the government was doing everything possible to free the hostages.
法国外交部长没有对录像带的内容或要求发表评论，但今晚表示政府正在尽一切努力释放人质。

For National Public Radio, this is Melody Walker in Paris." Skies are clearing over Oklahoma where heavy rains have produced what’s being called "the worst flooding in the history of that state." Thousands of people began returning to their homes and officials began the task of assessing the damage.
国家公共广播电台报道，我是巴黎的梅洛迪·沃克。”俄克拉荷马州的天空正在放晴，那里的大雨引发了所谓的“该州历史上最严重的洪水”。评估损失的任务。

Floods have caused millions of dollars in damage, but specific estimates may not come until tomorrow when clean-up operations are expected to start.
洪水已造成数百万美元的损失，但具体的估计可能要到明天清理工作开始时才能得出。

Tonight, a Soviet nuclear submarine is on the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, damaged three days ago by a fire on board.
今晚，一艘苏联核潜艇停泊在大西洋海底，三天前因船上起火而受损。

Officials in Washington and Moscow confirmed this morning’s sinking.
华盛顿和莫斯科的官员今天上午证实了沉船事件。

Officials in both countries also said the loss of the vessel presents no atomic threat despite the presence of both nuclear missiles and a nuclear power reactor on the submarine.
两国官员还表示，尽管潜艇上装有核导弹和核动力反应堆，但该船的损失并不构成原子威胁。

NPR’s Daivd Malthus has a report: Pentagon officials say the crippled Soviet submarine, which normally carries sixteen nuclear missiles, each with two warheads, went down just before dawn six hundred and eighty miles northeast of Bermuda.
NPR 的戴夫德·马尔萨斯 (Daivd Malthus) 有一篇报道：五角大楼官员称，这艘受损的苏联潜艇通常携带 16 枚核导弹，每枚核导弹各有两枚弹头，在黎明前夕在百慕大东北六百八十英里处沉没。

The Soviets put the precise time of sinking at 4:03 am eastern time, and Moscow says there was no further loss of life aside from the three crewmen killed when a fire broke out Friday.
苏联人将沉没的准确时间定为东部时间凌晨 4 点 03 分，莫斯科表示，除了周五发生火灾时丧生的三名船员外，没有其他人丧生。

American surveillance planes observed that towing efforts were halted shortly after midnight.
美国侦察机观察到，拖曳工作在午夜过后不久就停止了。

About three hours later, the remaining crew members were observed abandoning ship in an orderly and planned fashion, according to American officials.
据美国官员称，大约三小时后，剩下的船员被发现有秩序、有计划地弃船。

The crew was rescued from life rafts by five Soviet surface ships in the area.
船员们被该地区的五艘苏联水面舰艇从救生筏上救起。

Pentagon officials say a US ocean-going tugboat was nearby and ready to assist, but the Soviets refused any help.
五角大楼官员表示，一艘美国远洋拖船就在附近并准备提供援助，但苏联拒绝提供任何帮助。

Pentagon sources do not rule out the possibility that the Soviets scuttled their sub once it became clear that leaks could not be controlled.
五角大楼的消息来源并不排除一旦发现泄漏无法控制，苏联就会凿沉潜艇的可能性。

The Soviets have not explained the cause of the damage to the ship, but Pentagon officials say there was an explosion in one of the missile tubes that blew a big hole in the deck.
苏联尚未解释这艘船受损的原因，但五角大楼官员表示，其中一根导弹管发生爆炸，在甲板上炸出了一个大洞。

Vice Admiral Powell Carter describes the damage this way: "You’re talking about a structure that’s enormously strong up there.
鲍威尔·卡特中将这样描述损坏情况：“你谈论的是那里的一个非常坚固的结构。

It’s like, each of those missile tube doors that shuts is just like a safe vault.
就像，每一扇关闭的导弹发射管门都像一个安全的金库。

And then it shuts and locks with a big rotating ring, and that’s been torn completely loose and bent like a pretzel back.
然后它会关闭并用一个大旋转环锁定，然后它就被完全撕开并像椒盐卷饼一样弯曲。

So the force of the explosion was enormous." While Pentagon officials say they don’t know what caused the missile tube explosion, they point out that Soviet missiles use highly volatile liquid fuel, and a fuel leak could have caused the eruption.
所以爆炸的威力是巨大的。”虽然五角大楼官员表示，他们不知道是什么原因导致了导弹管爆炸，但他们指出，苏联导弹使用高挥发性液体燃料，燃料泄漏可能导致爆炸。

Again, Admiral Carter: "These liquid fuel systems are very, very dangerous; they’re very unstable.
卡特海军上将再次强调：“这些液体燃料系统非常非常危险；它们非常不稳定。

That’s why, very early in our missile program as pushing a leading edge of technology, we moved to solid fuel missiles, early on just for that fact, because liquid fuel is extremely dangerous." Admiral Carter said it was possible the nuclear warheads on top of the missile burned in the fire, or were thrown out into the water and sunk to the bottom 18,000 feet below.
这就是为什么，在我们的导弹计划的早期，为了推动技术的前沿，我们很早就转向了固体燃料导弹，只是为了这个事实，因为液体燃料极其危险。”卡特海军上将表示，顶部可能装有核弹头导弹在火中燃烧，或者被抛入水中并沉入 18,000 英尺以下的海底。

He said the other missiles and warheads might have been damaged by pressure as the sub sank, but there was no chance of a nuclear detonation or serious radiation leakage.
他说，潜艇沉没时，其他导弹和弹头可能因压力而损坏，但不存在核爆炸或严重辐射泄漏的可能性。

The submarine’s nuclear reactors, officials say, are self-contained in what amounts to rust-proof metal vaults, and the Soviet say the reactors were shut down prior to sinking.
官员称，这艘潜艇的核反应堆是独立的，位于防锈金属拱顶内，苏联表示，这些反应堆在沉没前已关闭。

US officials say preliminary tests of the air and sea in the area have produced no signs of radioactive release.
美国官员表示，对该地区空气和海洋的初步测试没有发现放射性物质释放的迹象。

Pentagon officials say the US will not make any attempt to recover the Soviet sub.
五角大楼官员表示，美国不会尝试打捞这艘苏联潜艇。

"It’s Soviet property," says the Navy.
“这是苏联的财产，”海军说。

Retired submarine Captain James Bush of the Center for Defense Information says a salvage effort just isn’t warranted in this case with the submarine that was designed in the 1960s.
国防信息中心的退役潜艇艇长詹姆斯·布什表示​​，对于这艘 20 世纪 60 年代设计的潜艇来说，没有必要进行打捞工作。

"It’s an old submarine with old missiles.
“这是一艘装有旧导弹的旧潜艇。

I don’t know that we would consider it worthwhile to have them to look at for the amount of money involved.
我不知道我们是否会认为值得让他们考虑所涉及的金额。

Now, it would probably be worthwhile if we could, get their communications equipment and their coding equipment, their key lists, and things like that to decode messages.
现在，如果我们能够获得他们的通信设备、编码设备、密钥列表以及诸如此类的东西来解码消息，那可能是值得的。

But I’m sure that the Soviets, with the time that they had prior to the submarine sinking, should have gotten all of that material off." Pentagon officials say the sub loss should not be a serious setback for the Soviets, but some analysts disagree.
但我确信苏联人在潜艇沉没之前的时间里应该已经把所有这些材料都拿走了。”五角大楼官员表示，潜艇的损失对苏联来说不会是一个严重的挫折，但一些分析人士认为不同意。

Pentagon consultant Norman Freedman says the Soviets have to be worried about liquid fueled missiles on other subs.
五角大楼顾问诺曼·弗里德曼表示，苏联必须担心其他潜艇上的液体燃料导弹。

"These things are time bombs," Freeman says.
“这些东西都是定时炸弹，”弗里曼说。

"They should all be called in and checked out." I’m David Malthus in Washington.
“他们都应该被叫进来并检查一下。”我是华盛顿的大卫·马尔萨斯。

"We think that we have solved this most venerable and grand of geographic mysteries." With those words, Joseph Judge of National Geographic magazine announced a major discovery in American history—the true spot where Christopher Columbus first landed in the new world.
“我们认为我们已经解决了这个最古老、最伟大的地理之谜。”国家地理杂志的约瑟夫·贾奇用这句话宣布了美国历史上的一项重大发现——克里斯托弗·哥伦布首次登陆新大陆的真正地点。

And the Geographic 's declaration upsets the orthodox assertions of nearly every American history textbook.
《地理》杂志的声明颠覆了几乎所有美国历史教科书的正统主张。

NPR’s Frank Browning has this story.
NPR 的弗兰克·布朗宁有这样的故事。

The orthodox explanation of where Columbus first landed was carved in textbook stone more than forty years ago by the dean of Columbus historians, Samuel Elliot Morrison.
四十多年前，哥伦布历史学家泰斗塞缪尔·埃利奥特·莫里森在教科书上刻下了关于哥伦布首次登陆地点的正统解释。

Morrison declared incontrovertible the evidence that Columbus first set foot on Watling Island in the eastern Bahamas.
莫里森宣称哥伦布首次踏上巴哈马东部沃特林岛的证据无可争议。

But if the question were closed for Professor Morrison, now dead, it was not for numerous other students on nautical history.
但如果这个问题对于现已去世的莫里森教授来说已经结束了，那么对于许多其他航海史学生来说却不是这样。

For the last five years, the National Geographic 's Joseph Judge, has dispatched teams of historians, oceanographers, archaeologists and translators to find the true location and thereby to set straight the first footsteps of the American saga.
在过去的五年里，《国家地理》杂志的约瑟夫·贾奇派遣了由历史学家、海洋学家、考古学家和翻译人员组成的团队去寻找真正的地点，从而踏上美国传奇的第一步。

"The famous fleet of Columbus—the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria—made its first landfall and its landing in the new world in 1492 at a small island in the eastern Bahamas, named today, Samana Cay." The basic problem in identifying Columbus' landing point, which he named San Salvador in 1492, is that he left no clear markings.
“哥伦布著名的舰队——尼娜号、平塔号和圣玛丽亚号——于 1492 年在巴哈马群岛东部的一个小岛首次登陆并登陆新世界，该岛今天命名为萨马纳岛。”哥伦布于 1492 年将登陆点命名为圣萨尔瓦多，识别登陆点的基本问题是他没有留下明显的标记。

Moreover, the log of Columbus' voyage now exists only in a transcription made by the Spaniard Bartolomay de las Casas, and many of the descriptions are either vague or use archaic terminology.
此外，哥伦布航海日志现在只存在于西班牙人巴托洛梅·德拉斯·卡萨斯的抄本中，许多描述要么含糊不清，要么使用古老的术语。

Professor Morrison had based has conclusions on a straightforward reading of the log.
莫里森教授是根据对日志的直接阅读得出的结论。

But he took no account of how Columbus' route would have been affected by constant ocean currents and winds.
但他没有考虑到哥伦布的路线会如何受到持续洋流和风的影响。

When the Geographic team took the same data and then adjusted them for the effect of wind and current, they arrived at Samana Cay, to the southeast of Watling Island.
当地理团队获取相同的数据并根据风和海流的影响进行调整时，他们到达了沃特林岛东南部的萨马纳礁。

Then to collaborate their findings, they went to points further down on Columbus' voyage, then backtracked according to the log notations, and again found that they landed not on Professor Morrison’s Watling Island, but on Samana Cay.
然后，为了配合他们的发现，他们去了哥伦布航行的更远的地方，然后根据航海记录符号回溯，再次发现他们登陆的不是莫里森教授的沃特林岛，而是萨马纳岛。

Once on Samana, the team then returned to Columbus' log, to compare what they saw to Columbus' own visual description, recounted here by writer Judge in a film clip: "You need sediments on a ridge behind the beach.
到达萨马纳后，研究小组返回哥伦布的航海日志，将他们所看到的内容与哥伦布自己的视觉描述进行比较，作家贾奇在电影剪辑中对此进行了描述：“你需要海滩后面的山脊上的沉积物。

Here is the beach, right here.
这里是海滩，就在这里。

You need a lagoon with a very narrow entrance and that you have there.
你需要一个入口非常狭窄的泻湖，而且你已经在那里了。

You need a piece of land shaped like an island that is not, and that you have there.
你需要一块形状像岛屿的土地，但你已经在那里了。

In other words, every piece of geography that you’re seeing before your eyes in this island is described in the Columbus' log." Moreover, Judge’s team found archaeological traces of a settlement Columbus had mentioned finding on the actual island.
换句话说，你在这个岛上看到的每一片地理都在哥伦布的航海日志中描述过。”此外，贾奇的团队还发现了哥伦布提到的在实际岛屿上发现的定居点的考古痕迹。

So far, it is too early to know how the Geographic 's discoveries will affect the literature of professional history.
到目前为止，要知道《地理学》的发现将如何影响专业历史文献还为时过早。

But for those who worry about what may become of the site in an age of overnight historical theme parks, Bahamian Minister of Education, Paul Adderly, who attended the press conference, assured questioners that the island will be safe.
但对于那些担心在历史主题公园一夜之间该岛会变成什么样子的人来说，出席新闻发布会的巴哈马教育部长保罗·阿德利向提问者保证，该岛将是安全的。

In Washington, I’m Frank Browning reporting.
我是弗兰克·勃朗宁，在华盛顿报道。
