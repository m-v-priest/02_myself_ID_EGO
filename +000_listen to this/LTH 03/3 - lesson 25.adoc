Lesson 25


US officials are denying any official American connection with a plane Nicaragua says it shot down over the weekend.

[.my2]
美国官员否认美国与尼加拉瓜称其在周末被击落的飞机有任何官方联系。

The Sandinista government says three Americans were killed and a fourth, identified as Eugene Hasenfus of Marinette, Wisconsin, was captured.

[.my2]
桑地诺政府表示，三名美国人被杀，第四名美国人被抓获，他的身份是来自威斯康星州马里内特的尤金·哈森福斯。

Nicaragua says Hasenfus identified himself as a US military advisor.

[.my2]
尼加拉瓜称哈森福斯自称是美国军事顾问。

But Secretary of State George Shultz said the transport which allegedly was carrying weapons to contra rebels was sponsored by a private American group, and that none of the people on board the plane were with US military intelligence operations.

[.my2]
但国务卿乔治·舒尔茨表示，这架据称为反叛分子运送武器的运输机是由美国私人团体赞助的，飞机上没有人参与美国军事情报部门的工作。

A spokesman for Austrian President Kurt Waldheim says Waldheim now says he was in Cozara, Yugoslavia during the 1942 Nazi massacre.

[.my2]
奥地利总统库尔特·瓦尔德海姆的发言人表示，瓦尔德海姆现在表示 1942 年纳粹大屠杀期间他就在南斯拉夫科扎拉。

But this does not in any way make him a war criminal.

[.my2]
但这绝不能使他成为战犯。

Gerald Christian was responding to a story in the Washington Post today in which he was quoted as saying that after additional research, Waldheim had determined that he served as a supply officer in Coraza.

[.my2]
杰拉尔德·克里斯蒂安今天回应《华盛顿邮报》的一篇报道，报道援引他的话称，经过进一步研究，瓦尔德海姆确定他曾在科拉萨担任补给官。

Christian says that Waldheim was not a combatant in the pacification campaign, which resulted in the death of thousands of people.

[.my2]
克里斯蒂安说，瓦尔德海姆并不是平定运动的战斗人员，平定运动导致数千人死亡。

Reacting to the latest disclosure, Attorney General Edward Meese said this will be additional information that we will consider in making a decision on whether to bar Waldheim from the United States.

[.my2]
针对最新披露，司法部长爱德华·米斯表示，这将是我们在决定是否禁止瓦尔德海姆进入美国时考虑的额外信息。

South Africa reacted today to allegations that it is to blame for the plane crash that killed Mozambique President, Samora Machel.

[.my2]
南非今天对莫桑比克总统萨莫拉·马谢尔遇难的空难负有责任的指控作出反应。

Defense Minister, Magnis Balong said South Africa is not involved in the accident in any way.

[.my2]
国防部长马格尼斯·巴隆表示，南非与这起事故没有任何关系。

He said African leaders like Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, are spreading propaganda, and Balong warned that they are playing what he called "a dangerous game".

[.my2]
他说，赞比亚总统肯尼思·卡翁达等非洲领导人正在散布宣传，巴隆警告说，他们正在玩他所谓的“危险游戏”。

Not our plane, not our advisor.

[.my2]
不是我们的飞机，不是我们的顾问。

Denials in Washington today about an American and his aircraft shot down this weekend in Nicaragua.

[.my2]
今天华盛顿否认一名美国人及其飞机本周末在尼加拉瓜被击落。

The Sandinistas said yesterday their government troops shot down a transport plane, killing three Americans and capturing a fourth.

[.my2]
桑地诺民族解放阵线昨天表示，他们的政府军击落了一架运输机，造成三名美国人死亡，并俘获了第四名美国人。

The Nicaraguans charge that the plane was on CIA mission.

[.my2]
尼加拉瓜人指控这架飞机正在执行中央情报局的任务。

They say the aircraft was to ferry supplies to US-backed contra rebels in southern Nicaragua.

[.my2]
他们说，这架飞机是为了向尼加拉瓜南部美国支持的反叛分子运送物资。

Today, Reagan Administration officials denied the plane was an American military aircraft, or that the survivor was a US military advisor.

[.my2]
今天，里根政府官员否认这架飞机是美国军用飞机，也否认幸存者是美国军事顾问。

NPR's Richard Gonzalez reports.
NPR 的理查德·冈萨雷斯报道。

The Nicaraguan government identified the surviving crew member as Eugene Hasenfus, and said the man had identified himself as a US military advisor in nearby El Salvador.

[.my2]
尼加拉瓜政府确认幸存船员为尤金·哈森福斯，并表示该男子自称是驻萨尔瓦多附近的美国军事顾问。

But relatives in Wisconsin said the man's name is Eugene Hasenfus, and that he is an ex-marine who had been working for a Florida air freight company since this summer.

[.my2]
但威斯康星州的亲戚称，这名男子名叫尤金·哈森福斯，是一名前海军陆战队员，自今年夏天以来一直在佛罗里达州的一家航空货运公司工作。

Hasenfus' wife, Sally, was contacted, but she declined to say whether she had been notified by US officials and would not say anything more about her husband's activities.

[.my2]
我们联系了哈森福斯的妻子莎莉，但她拒绝透露是否已收到美国官员的通知，也不愿透露更多有关她丈夫的活动的信息。

Secretary of State George Shultz said today the plane had been hired by private citizens who had no connection to the US government.

[.my2]
美国国务卿乔治·舒尔茨今天表示，这架飞机是由与美国政府没有关系的私人公民租用的。

"The people involved were not from our military, not from any US government agency, and CIA included.

[.my2]
“涉案人员不是来自我们的军队，也不是来自任何美国政府机构，包括中央情报局。

So it's …​  所以这是……​

these are private citizens, and it's not a governmental operation." Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, there were cautious reactions to the reports of the downed aircraft.

[.my2]
这些都是普通公民，这不是政府行动。”与此同时，在国会山，人们对飞机被击落的报道做出了谨慎的反应。

Republican Senator David Durenberger of Minnesota, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the CIA had assured him that the plane, its pilots and cargo had no connection to US government efforts to support the contras.

[.my2]
参议院情报委员会主席、明尼苏达州共和党参议员戴维·杜伦伯格表示，中央情报局已向他保证，这架飞机、机上飞行员和货物与美国政府支持反政府武装的努力没有任何关系。

But Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont said he doubts the administration is telling everything it knows about the plane.

[.my2]
但佛蒙特州民主党参议员帕特里克·莱希表示，他怀疑政府是否会透露有关这架飞机的一切信息。

"If Americans are down there, it stretches credulity for anybody to think that they could be operating out of either Costa Rica or Honduras without the knowledge of US authorities." There are several private groups who have raised funds to send supplies and military trainers to the contras.

[.my2]
“如果美国人在那里，任何人都难以相信他们可能在美国当局不知情的情况下在哥斯达黎加或洪都拉斯开展业务。”有几个私人团体筹集资金向反政府武装运送物资和军事训练员。

One of the most active groups, Civilian Material Assistance, which has been involved in supply flights to the contras in the past, denied any connection to this latest incident.

[.my2]
最活跃的团体之一，民间物资援助组织，过去曾参与向反政府武装提供补给的航班，但否认与这起最新事件有任何联系。

Another group, the US Council for World Freedom led by retired General John Singlaub has sent the contras boats, clothing and weapons.

[.my2]
另一个组织，即由退役将军约翰·辛劳布领导的美国世界自由委员会，已经发送了反政府武装船只、衣物和武器。

Singlaub could not be reached for comment today.

[.my2]
今天未能联系到辛劳布发表评论。

US citizens working with the contras commonly refer to themselves as US advisors.

[.my2]
与反政府武装合作的美国公民通常称自己为美国顾问。

Congress has approved $100,000,000 in military and non-lethal aid to the contras, but barred direct US military support, including the presence of US advisors on Nicaragua soil.

[.my2]
国会已批准向反政府武装提供 1 亿美元的军事和非致命援助，但禁止美国直接提供军事支持，包括在尼加拉瓜领土上派驻美国顾问。

Here in Washington, a spokesman for the Nicaraguan Embassy, Francisco Cambbe, said his government sees no difference between congressionally approved aid to the contras and privately funded assistance.

[.my2]
在华盛顿，尼加拉瓜大使馆发言人弗朗西斯科·坎贝表示，尼加拉瓜政府认为国会批准的对反政府武装的援助与私人资助的援助没有区别。

"The administration of the United States is actively involved in promoting and encouraging North American citizens to become involved in this dirty war against Nicaragua.

[.my2]
“美国政府积极推动和鼓励北美公民参与这场针对尼加拉瓜的肮脏战争。

This past Sunday General Singlaub on '60 Minutes' stated clearly that his so-called private operation was being carried out with the support and encouragement of the White House.

[.my2]
上周日辛劳布将军在《60分钟》节目中明确表示，他的所谓私人行动是在白宫的支持和鼓励下进行的。

So, therefore, there is no distinction whatsoever." At a news conference today for four Americans engaged in a fast and protest of the administration's support for the contras, Democratic Senator John Carry of Massachusetts said, many questions about the downed plane still remain unanswered. "If it's an American plane, with Americans on board, with an American military advisor, carrying weapons and war supplies that originated in this country, which is somehow over Nicaraguan air space, to the degree that it landed in Nicaraguan space, that ought to be of serious concern to the people of this country." Carry said more information is needed to determine whether the plane was a privately-funded effort, and to what degree such activities violate international law.

[.my2]
所以，因此，没有任何区别。” 马萨诸塞州民主党参议员约翰·凯利在今天举行的新闻发布会上，四名美国人参加了一场快速抗议政府支持反政府武装的活动，他说，有关坠落飞机的许多问题仍未得到解答“如果这是一架美国飞机，机上有美国人，有美国军事顾问，载有源自这个国家的武器和战争物资，不知何故在尼加拉瓜领空上空，就其降落在尼加拉瓜领空而言，应该凯利表示，需要更多信息来确定这架飞机是否是私人资助的，以及此类活动违反国际法的程度。

小妖精、鬼魂、王子和公主。

This is the way many people are dressing this Halloween.

[.my2]
这是今年万圣节许多人的着装方式。

But in some places, Halloween revellers are decked out more aggressively, arming themselves with what pass for the guns of modern warfare.

[.my2]
但在一些地方，万圣节狂欢者的打扮更加激进，用现代战争的枪支武装自己。

Just outside Baltimore on Harford Road, there's a gun shop that's doing a booming business this Halloween.

[.my2]
就在巴尔的摩郊外的哈福德路上，有一家枪店，今年万圣节生意兴隆。

They've got uzzies, M-16s, Thompson submachine guns, all made from plastic.

[.my2]
他们有乌兹枪、M-16 步枪、汤普森冲锋枪，全部由塑料制成。

Replicas, which police say, are so accurately crafted that on a dark night they easily pass for the real thing.

[.my2]
警方称，这些复制品制作得非常精确，在漆黑的夜晚它们很容易被误认为是真品。

Patrick Lauchlin, who works at the shop and also sells real guns, says they've been hot items for tonight's festivities.

[.my2]
帕特里克·劳克林（Patrick Lauchlin）在这家商店工作，也销售真枪，他说这些枪是今晚庆祝活动的热门商品。

"This year, assault rifles, in the Rambo mode, like, especially the M-16 Colt, you know, and of course the Thompson's a classic for the Bonnie and Clyde, in, you know, twenties era, and I just rented three of the western rigs with the western type of single action army Colt revolver for a car dealer who's dressing his people up for a sales promotion." One especially favored replica is of a Walther P-38, that Pat Lauchlin wears in his holster.

[.my2]
“今年，突击步枪，兰博模式，尤其是 M-16 Colt，你知道，当然，汤普森是二十年代邦妮和克莱德的经典之作，我刚刚租了三把为一位汽车经销商配备了西方类型的单动军用柯尔特左轮手枪，该经销商正在为促销活动打扮他的员工。”其中一款特别受欢迎的复制品是 Walther P-38，帕特·劳克林 (Pat Lauchlin) 就将其放在皮套中。

Lauchlin says he's had relatively few children asking for them for trick-or-treating, though there was one, but he doesn't think it's a good idea for ten-year-olds to carry replica weapons that look as real as these.

[.my2]
劳克林说，他的孩子相对较少要求他们玩“不给糖就捣蛋”的游戏，尽管有一个，但他认为让十岁的孩子携带看起来像这样真实的复制武器不是一个好主意。

"They are totally realistic looking.

[.my2]
“它们看起来完全现实。

They basically function and disassemble like a real gun world.

[.my2]
它们的功能和拆卸基本上就像真实的枪支世界一样。

But they're made primarily out of pop metal and some plastic and cannot be made to fire in any way." But even though these guns are fake, they're not cheap.

[.my2]
但它们主要由流行金属和一些塑料制成，不能以任何方式发射。”但即使这些枪是假的，它们也不便宜。

P-38 Walthers with gun powder caps start at $79, and the Thompsons run some 250.

[.my2]
带火药帽的 P-38 Walthers 起价为 79 美元，Thomsons 的售价约为 250 美元。

Beyond Baltimore, though, the gun replicas have also been hot sellers in many fancy adult toy stores, notably for the Sharper Image Chain.

[.my2]
不过，除了巴尔的摩之外，这些枪支复制品在许多高档成人玩具店也很畅销，尤其是 Sharper Image Chain。

Lisa Bouche is spokesperson for Sharper Image at its San Francisco headquarters.
Lisa Bouche 是 Sharper Image 旧金山总部的发言人。

"We, of course, see a surge in a lot of sales around this time of year with the holidays coming up, and I would imagine a lot of people probably …​

[.my2]
“当然，随着假期的临近，我们会看到每年这个时候销量激增，我想很多人可能......​

even though they are in the high end in price, our customer generally does have quite a bit of money to spend.

[.my2]
尽管它们的价格较高，但我们的客户通常确实有很多钱可以花。

So I could definitely foresee them buying it for that purpose." Lest anyone misperceive, who it is that is looking for the guns, Bouche is quick to note that the average income of the store's shoppers is $91,000.

[.my2]
所以我绝对可以预见他们会出于这个目的而购买它。”为了避免有人误会是谁在寻找枪支，布什很快指出，商店购物者的平均收入为 91,000 美元。

* * In World War II, many Air Force pilots would convince that mechanical and electronic problems were caused by gremlins.
** 在第二次世界大战中，许多空军飞行员相信机械和电子问题是由小精灵引起的。

According to Mike Waters, gremlins are small creatures rarely noticed by humans anymore.

[.my2]
据迈克·沃特斯介绍，小魔怪是人类很少注意到的小生物。

But he says they are still among us.

[.my2]
但他说他们仍然在我们中间。

Gremlins, like almost all creatures, like to have recognition.

[.my2]
小魔怪，就像几乎所有的生物一样，喜欢得到认可。

There was a time when the mischievous works of gremlins were almost legend.

[.my2]
曾经有一段时间，小妖怪的恶作剧几乎成了传奇。

But now people talk about bugs in the equipment.

[.my2]
但现在人们谈论的是设备中的错误。

It's not bugs.  这不是错误。

It's the gremlins.  这是小魔怪。

There is one night, one night every year, when some gremlins are acknowledged, and that night is Halloween.

[.my2]
每年都有一个晚上，一些小妖怪会被承认，而那天晚上就是万圣节。

I know a gremlin who, on Halloween night, goes skipping down a street until it sees a lighted porch.

[.my2]
我认识一个小妖精，它在万圣节之夜沿着街道蹦蹦跳跳，直到看到一个亮着灯的门廊。

It will climb the stairs, reach up, press the doorbell, and wait for the lady of the house to come, who invariably will say something like, "You're a little gremlin, aren't you?" The gremlin will nod.

[.my2]
它会爬上楼梯，伸手按门铃，然后等待女主人到来，女主人总是会说“你是个小妖精，不是吗？”小妖精会点头。

And she will say, "Would you like some taffy?" And the gremlin would say, "No." "You have a deep voice." The gremlin would nod.

[.my2]
她会说：“你想要一些太妃糖吗？”小妖精会说：“不。” “你的声音很深沉。”小妖精会点头。

"What's your name, child?" "Inkey." "Do you live in this neighborhood, child?" "No." "What's your last name, child?" "Gall." "Inkey Gall.

[.my2]
“孩子，你叫什么名字？” “因基。” “孩子，你住在这附近吗？” “不。” “孩子，你姓什么？” “瘿。” “因基·加尔。

Would you like some Tootsie Rolls, Inkey Gall?" "No.

[.my2]
你想吃点Tootsie Rolls吗，Inkey Gall？” “不。

" "What would you like?" "I'd like to mess up your TV." "Is your mother out there on the sidewalk?" "No." "John, John, would you come in here, please?" "Barbara, the TV's gone funny.

[.my2]
” “你想要什么？” “我想弄乱你的电视。” “你妈妈在人行道上吗？” “没有。” “约翰，约翰，请进来一下好吗？”芭芭拉，电视变得很有趣。

I have to fix it." "Inkey Gall, I think your mother wants you.

[.my2]
我必须解决这个问题。” “Inkey Gall，我想你妈妈想要你。

I think you should go home right away." The gremlin smiled, or grimaced, which is the way a gremlin smiles.

[.my2]
我想你应该马上回家。” 小妖怪微笑着，或者做鬼脸，这就是小妖怪微笑的方式。

And as it moved across the porch, it turned and said, "I've messed up every drop of milk in your refrigerator." And the woman knew that all the milk in the refrigerator was sour.

[.my2]
当它穿过门廊时，它转身说：“我把你冰箱里的每一滴牛奶都弄脏了。”而女人知道冰箱里的牛奶全都是酸的。

Inkey Gall turned, bounced down the steps and skipped down the street, looking for another house, where the porch lights were lit.

[.my2]
英基·加尔转身，跳下台阶，跳到街上，寻找另一栋门廊灯亮着的房子。

Now, there's no such thing as insurance against gremlins.

[.my2]
现在，没有针对小妖精的保险。

So if you answer your door on Halloween, you should know, not everyone that looks like a gremlin is a child, and not everyone is interested in treats.

[.my2]
所以，如果你在万圣节开门，你应该知道，并不是每个看起来像小妖精的人都是孩子，也不是每个人都对零食感兴趣。
