Lesson27



The Soviet news agency TASS reports that an American cancer researcher has defected to the Soviet Union. According to TASS, Arnold Loskin, his wife and three children arrived in Moscow today after being granted political asylum. TASS said Loskin has defected after being fired from his job, because he opposed US foreign policy. The upcoming summit is having an impact on the budget debate on Capitol Hill. President Reagan accused Congress of helping Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev by attaching arms control demands to the spending bill. The House wants the President to continue to abide by the terms of the ungratified SALT II Treaty, among other things. House leaders say the President is threatening to shut down the government unless he gets his way on arms issues. The House today approved a compromise anti-drug bill that would institute the death penalty for drug related murders. A provision threatened a filibuster to keep it from passing. Representatives dropped the provision from the original bill that would require the use of the military to patrol the border against drug smuggling. It hasn't rained until ... since Saturday in Eastern Missouri, but flooding problems continue to intensify along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers north of St. Louis. Thousands have been forced to leave their homes as flood waters continue to rise. Jim Dryden of member station KWMU in St. Louis reports. "In St. Charles Counry just to the north of St. Louis, flooding is worse now than at any time in recent history. All of the levees along the Missouri River have broken, and the towns of Portage Des Sioux and Westalton, which sit at the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, have been completely isolated by water. Ray Camp of the St. Charles County Office of Emergency Management says levees and dikes north of the confluence of the two rivers are causing those rivers to seek out new channels. Westalton is now
under the water of one such new channel. That town is being evacuated this evening after desperate attempts to sandbag it failed. Almost the entire peninsula which sits at the confluence of the two rivers is under as much as fifteen feet of water, and is now accessible only by boat. And even though the Missouri River reached its crest this morning and the Mississippi is expected to crest tomorrow, emergency management officials say it will be quite some time before residents of the flooded area will be able to return home. For National Public Radio, I'm Jim Dryden in St. Louis." As President Reagan gets ready for this weekend's meeting with Soviet leader Gorbachev, commentator Cal Thomas thinks that House Democrats are depriving the President of the most important thing he could take to Iceland—a clear control over US foreign policy. House majority leader Jim Wright isn't even Speaker of the House yet, and already he is acting as if he were President. Wright has offered President Reagan a deal. He says he and House Democrats will delay a showdown with the White House over arms control until next year if the President will agree to terms for future consideration of constraints on strategic weapons and other House arms control strategies. These would include abiding by weapons limits in the unratified SALT II Treaty, which the Soviets have repeatedly violated. This type of behavior on the eve of a meeting in Iceland between the President and Mikhail Gorbachev would be unseemly enough for any member of Congress. But for major Democratic leader it is unconscionable. Why should Gorbachev feel any need to negotiate with the President if House Democrats led by Jim Wright are doing his job for him? Gorbachev, of course, is under no such pressure since members of the Politburo in one-party Russia compete only for the privilege of being the loudest ratifier of Gorbachev policies. Wright, who was a co-signer of a 1984 "Dear Commandant" letter to Nicaragua's Marxist dictator Daniel Ortega, in which, among other things, he deplored his own country's policies against the Central American nation, apparently believes that cutting a deal with the Soviets in which we all will live in a safer world is like a mating game. One must make the right moves before the other party shows any interest. The Soviets are pressing ahead on all fronts, offensive and defensive weapons and laser technology, even while they denounce the United States for conducting research on its own strategic defense initiative. Will they be impressed by the good will Congressman Wright thinks he is displaying by trying to tie the President's hands before Iceland? Hardly. Gorbachev will try to tie the President's feet as well. The history of this country before the Vietnam War was that the President of the United States set American foreign policy. The Congress advised and debated, but in the end it was the President who prevailed if differences arose. Now it is the Congress that is making foreign policy: on South Africa, on Central America, and, on the most dangerous level of all, with our chief adversary, the Soviet Union. There is no room for mistakes in dealing with the Soviets, but Jim Wright and the House Democrats are making them. Gorbachev will arrive in Reykjavik well rested, knowing that much of his work will
have already been done for him by Jim Wright. No wonder he's bringing his wife. There will be plenty of spare time for socializing. Cal Thomas is a columnist for the Los Angeles Times Syndicate. The Superpower leaders left Iceland this weekend without moving their nations noticeably closer to peace. But at the same time another interaction between Americans and Soviet citizens was just getting started in the USSR. It is a meeting of Northern people, an Arctic attempt at understanding. From Anchorage, reporter Joanna Urick has more on the Alaska Performing Arts for Peace. Before Leaving for the Soviet Union, sixty Alaskans from throughout the state gathered in a log cabin on a lake outside of Anchorage to rehearse. "I see people from Moscow. I see people from Leningrad." As John Pingyer, a Upic Eskimo reads his lines, he's thinking about an ancient Upic ceremony called "the Bladder Festival," in which people from different villages gather together. At the end of the week-long rituals they take the bladders from seals their hunters have taken during the past year and inflate them so they'll float. Then they return the seal bladders to the ocean. "There's a lot of symbolism behind the ceremony. And one of the strongest symbolism that we're using in this Bladder Festival is ... togetherness of people, as one part of one big village or a community, and then we use it to portray the closeness of people, which is the peace." The Bladder Festival forms the dramatic framework for a show involving more than sixty people from Alaska. The Alaska Performing Arts for Peace will take their show through a succession of cities, towns and villages in the Soviet Union, culminating in the reunification of Siberian Upic Eskimos, people who have lived along the coast of the Bering Sea, until the Cold War moving freely back and forth between the continents. At times, they can see one another hunting on the ice, but actual contact has been forbidden since the coming of military installations following World War II. The Alaska villages of Wonga on St. Lawrence Island is actually closer to Siberia than to the US mainland. Seventy-year-old Aura Gologrogin, who accompanies the Wonga comedy players on the tour, remembers the last time she visited friends and relatives on the Siberian coast. She's looking forward to meeting them again. "Yeh, it is like a big family reunion. I was thinking if I could meet some of the people that I know long time ago, since I have been there when I was younger. In 1940 I go over and stay there for nine days and they were so nice people. And I want to meet them again." This tour is not just an Eskimo reunion. Along with some thirty Eskimos are chorus, cloggers, fiddlers and black gospel singers. "Each culture has something unique to offer, and that's what we have here. Each culture has something unique to offer, and that uniqueness will be pulled together as one. And that one body is what we are sharing with the Soviet Union." Shirley Staten is one of five gospel singers from Anchorage looking forward to another reunion with the small group of Russians, descendants of Black Americans
who emigrated to Moscow during the Depression. "And we're going to sit around and sing gospel music, and I am just ... I mean that's the highlight of the trip." "We are going to sing in chorus. Then we can start together in Russian. It seems like that's the way it's going to work." Organizer Digby Belger says it's taken two difficult years to make the tour of the Alaska Performing Artists for Peace a reality. And in that time, there have been dramatic ups and downs in US-Soviet relations. "In some way, this might be a nice time to go. And you know, if ... I really feel that the more tension between us, the more that we really need to communicate. And people to people exchange is a very good way to do that." The Alaska Performing Artists for Peace's month-long tour will take them from Moscow in the west to the Chukchi Peninsula in the east coast of Siberia. They'll return to the United States November 2nd. In Anchorage, this is Joanna Urich.


苏联通讯社塔斯社报道称，一名美国癌症研究人员叛逃到苏联。据塔斯社报道，阿诺德·洛斯金、他的妻子和三个孩子在获得政治庇护后于今天抵达莫斯科。塔斯社称，洛斯金因反对美国外交政策而被解雇后叛逃。即将举行的峰会将对国会山的预算辩论产生影响。里根总统指责国会通过将军备控制要求附加到支出法案中来帮助苏联领导人米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫。除其他事项外，众议院希望总统继续遵守尚未履行的 SALT II 条约的条款。众议院领导人表示，总统威胁要关闭政府，除非他在武器问题上如愿以偿。众议院今天批准了一项妥协的反毒品法案，将对与毒品有关的谋杀案判处死刑。一项条款威胁要进行阻挠以阻止其通过。代表们删除了最初法案中要求使用军队巡逻边境打击毒品走私的条款。密苏里州东部自周六以来一直没有下雨，但圣路易斯以北的密苏里河和密西西比河沿线的洪水问题继续加剧。由于洪水继续上涨，数千人被迫离开家园。圣路易斯 KWMU 会员站吉姆·德莱登 (Jim Dryden) 报道。 “在圣路易斯以北的圣查尔斯县，洪水现在比近代历史上任何时候都严重。密苏里河沿岸的所有堤坝都已决堤，位于波蒂奇德苏镇和韦斯塔尔顿的城镇位于密苏里河和密西西比河交汇处，已完全被水隔离。 查尔斯县应急管理办公室表示，两条河流交汇处以北的堤坝和堤坝正在导致这些河流寻找新的渠道。威斯塔尔顿现在就在这样一条新航道的水下。在拼命用沙袋包裹该城镇失败后，该镇将于今晚被疏散。位于两条河流交汇处的几乎整个半岛都在深达十五英尺的水下，现在只能乘船到达。尽管密苏里河今天早上达到了水位，密西西比河预计明天也会达到水位，但应急管理官员表示，洪水地区的居民需要相当长的时间才能返回家园。国家公共广播电台，我是圣路易斯的吉姆·德莱顿。”当里根总统准备本周末与苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫会面时，评论员卡尔·托马斯认为众议院民主党人正在剥夺总统可以采取的最重要的行动。冰岛——对美国外交政策的明确控制。众议院多数党领袖吉姆·赖特甚至还不是众议院议长，但他的表现就好像他是总统一样。赖特已向里根总统提出一项协议。他说他和众议院民主党人如果总统同意未来考虑限制战略武器和其他众议院军备控制战略的条款，将把与白宫就军备控制问题的摊牌推迟到明年。其中包括遵守未经批准的《限制战略武器条约》中的武器限制，苏联一再违反了这一规定。在总统和米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫在冰岛会晤前夕，这种行为对于任何国会议员来说都是不体面的。但对于民主党主要领导人来说，这是不合理的。 如果吉姆·赖特领导的众议院民主党人正在为戈尔巴乔夫做他的工作，为什么戈尔巴乔夫会觉得有必要与总统谈判呢？当然，戈尔巴乔夫并没有面临这样的压力，因为一党制俄罗斯的政治局成员只是为了成为戈尔巴乔夫政策最响亮的批准者的特权而竞争。赖特是 1984 年致尼加拉瓜马克思主义独裁者丹尼尔·奥尔特加的一封“亲爱的指挥官”信的共同签署人，他在信中除其他外，对自己国家针对中美洲国家的政策表示遗憾，他显然认为与尼加拉瓜达成协议我们所有人都将生活在一个更安全的世界中的苏联就像一场交配游戏。在对方表现出兴趣之前，一方必须采取正确的行动。苏联在进攻性和防御性武器以及激光技术等各个方面都在推进，尽管他们谴责美国对其自己的战略防御计划进行研究。他们会对赖特议员认为他试图在冰岛面前束缚总统的手脚所表现出的善意印象深刻吗？几乎不。戈尔巴乔夫也会试图绑住总统的脚。越南战争之前这个国家的历史是美国总统制定美国的外交政策。国会提出建议并进行辩论，但如果出现分歧，最终总统获胜。现在，国会正在制定外交政策：针对南非、针对中美洲，以及在最危险的层面上针对我们的主要对手苏联。与苏联打交道时不允许犯错误，但吉姆·赖特和众议院民主党人却犯了错误。戈尔巴乔夫将在休息良好的情况下抵达雷克雅未克，因为他知道吉姆·赖特已经为他完成了大部分工作。 难怪他会带上他的妻子。将会有充足的空闲时间进行社交。卡尔·托马斯是《洛杉矶时报辛迪加》的专栏作家。超级大国领导人本周末离开了冰岛，但并没有让他们的国家明显更接近和平。但与此同时，美国人和苏联公民之间的另一场互动才刚刚在苏联开始。这是北方人民的一次聚会，是一次北极理解的尝试。来自安克雷奇的记者乔安娜·尤里克 (Joanna Urick) 报道了有关阿拉斯加和平表演艺术的更多信息。在前往苏联之前，来自全州的 60 名阿拉斯加人聚集在安克雷奇郊外湖边的一间小木屋里进行排练。 “我看到来自莫斯科的人。我看到来自列宁格勒的人。”当乌匹克爱斯基摩人约翰·平耶 (John Pingyer) 朗读台词时，他想到了一种名为“膀胱节”的古老乌匹克仪式，来自不同村庄的人们聚集在一起。在为期一周的仪式结束时，他们会从猎人在过去一年中捕获的海豹身上取出膀胱，然后给它们充气，这样它们就能漂浮起来。然后他们将海豹膀胱放回海洋。 “仪式背后有很多象征意义。我们在这个膀胱节中使用的最强烈的象征意义之一是……人们团结一致，作为一个大村庄或一个社区的一部分，然后我们用它来描绘人与人之间的距离很近，这就是和平。”膀胱节为一场由来自阿拉斯加的 60 多人参与的表演搭建了戏剧性的框架。 阿拉斯加和平表演艺术将在苏联的一系列城市、城镇和村庄进行演出，最终使西伯利亚乌皮克爱斯基摩人重新统一，这些人一直生活在白令海沿岸，直到冷战结束。在各大洲之间自由来回。有时，他们可以看到彼此在冰上狩猎，但自从二战后军事设施出现以来，实际接触就被禁止了。圣劳伦斯岛的阿拉斯加旺加村庄实际上距离西伯利亚比距离美国大陆更近。 70 岁的奥拉·戈洛罗金 (Aura Gologrogin) 陪同旺加 (Wonga) 喜剧演员进行巡演，她还记得上次去西伯利亚海岸拜访朋友和亲戚的情景。她期待着再次见到他们。 “是啊，就像一个大家庭聚会。我在想是否可以见见一些我很久以前就认识的人，因为我年轻的时候就去过那里。1940年我过去在那里呆了九天他们都是非常好的人。我想再次见到他们。”这次旅行不仅仅是爱斯基摩人的聚会。除了大约三十名爱斯基摩人之外，还有合唱团、木鞋匠、小提琴手和黑人福音歌手。 “每种文化都有独特的东西可以提供，这就是我们在这里所拥有的。每种文化都有独特的东西可以提供，而这种独特性将被整合在一起。而这个整体就是我们与苏联共享的。”雪莉·史坦顿 (Shirley Staten) 是来自安克雷奇的五位福音歌手之一，他们期待与一小群俄罗斯人再次团聚，这些俄罗斯人是大萧条期间移民到莫斯科的美国黑人的后裔。 “我们将坐下来唱福音音乐，我只是……我的意思是这是这次旅行的亮点。” “我们要合唱。 然后我们就可以一起用俄语开始。组织者 Digby Belger 表示，阿拉斯加和平表演艺术家的巡回演出花了两年的时间才成为现实。在那段时间里，美国发生了戏剧性的起伏——与苏联的关系。“从某种程度上来说，这可能是一个很好的时机。你知道，如果……​我真的觉得我们之间越紧张，我们就越需要沟通。民间交流是一个很好的方式。”阿拉斯加和平表演艺术团为期一个月的巡演将从西部的莫斯科前往西伯利亚东海岸的楚科奇半岛。美国 11 月 2 日，在安克雷奇，我是乔安娜·尤里希 (Joanna Urich)。
