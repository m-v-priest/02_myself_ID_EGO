Louis." As President Reagan gets ready for this weekend's meeting with Soviet leader Gorbachev, commentator Cal Thomas thinks that House Democrats are depriving the President of the most important thing he could take to Iceland—a clear control over US foreign policy.

[.my2]
当里根总统准备本周末与苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫会面时，评论员卡尔·托马斯认为众议院民主党人正在剥夺总统可以给冰岛带来的最重要的东西——对美国外交政策的明确控制。

House majority leader Jim Wright isn't even Speaker of the House yet, and already he is acting as if he were President.

[.my2]
众议院多数党领袖吉姆·赖特甚至还不是众议院议长，但他的表现就好像他是总统一样。

Wright has offered President Reagan a deal.

[.my2]
赖特已向里根总统提出一项协议。

He says he and House Democrats will delay a showdown with the White House over arms control until next year if the President will agree to terms for future consideration of constraints on strategic weapons and other House arms control strategies.

[.my2]
他表示，如果总统同意未来考虑限制战略武器和其他众议院军备控制战略的条款，他和众议院民主党人将把与白宫在军备控制问题上的摊牌推迟到明年。

These would include abiding by weapons limits in the unratified SALT II Treaty, which the Soviets have repeatedly violated.

[.my2]
其中包括遵守未经批准的《第二阶段限制战略武器条约》中的武器限制，而苏联已多次违反该条约。

This type of behavior on the eve of a meeting in Iceland between the President and Mikhail Gorbachev would be unseemly enough for any member of Congress.

[.my2]
总统和米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫在冰岛会晤前夕的这种行为对于任何国会议员来说都是不体面的。

But for major Democratic leader it is unconscionable.

[.my2]
但对于民主党主要领导人来说，这是不合理的。

Why should Gorbachev feel any need to negotiate with the President if House Democrats led by Jim Wright are doing his job for him? Gorbachev, of course, is under no such pressure since members of the Politburo in one-party Russia compete only for the privilege of being the loudest ratifier of Gorbachev policies.

[.my2]
如果吉姆·赖特领导的众议院民主党人正在为戈尔巴乔夫做他的工作，为什么戈尔巴乔夫会觉得有必要与总统谈判呢？当然，戈尔巴乔夫并没有面临这样的压力，因为一党制俄罗斯的政治局成员只是为了成为戈尔巴乔夫政策最响亮的批准者的特权而竞争。

Wright, who was a co-signer of a 1984 "Dear Commandant" letter to Nicaragua's Marxist dictator Daniel Ortega, in which, among other things, he deplored his own country's policies against the Central American nation, apparently believes that cutting a deal with the Soviets in which we all will live in a safer world is like a mating game.

[.my2]
赖特是 1984 年致尼加拉瓜马克思主义独裁者丹尼尔·奥尔特加的一封“亲爱的指挥官”信的共同签署人，他在信中除其他外，对自己国家针对中美洲国家的政策表示遗憾，他显然认为与尼加拉瓜达成协议我们所有人都将生活在一个更安全的世界中的苏联就像一场交配游戏。

One must make the right moves before the other party shows any interest.

[.my2]
在对方表现出兴趣之前，一方必须采取正确的行动。

The Soviets are pressing ahead on all fronts, offensive and defensive weapons and laser technology, even while they denounce the United States for conducting research on its own strategic defense initiative.

[.my2]
苏联在进攻性和防御性武器以及激光技术等各个方面都在推进，尽管他们谴责美国对其自己的战略防御计划进行研究。

Will they be impressed by the good will Congressman Wright thinks he is displaying by trying to tie the President's hands before Iceland? Hardly.

[.my2]
他们会对赖特议员认为他试图在冰岛面前束缚总统的手脚所表现出的善意印象深刻吗？几乎不。

Gorbachev will try to tie the President's feet as well.

[.my2]
戈尔巴乔夫也会试图绑住总统的脚。

The history of this country before the Vietnam War was that the President of the United States set American foreign policy.

[.my2]
越南战争之前这个国家的历史是美国总统制定美国的外交政策。

The Congress advised and debated, but in the end it was the President who prevailed if differences arose.

[.my2]
国会提出建议并进行辩论，但如果出现分歧，最终总统获胜。

Now it is the Congress that is making foreign policy: on South Africa, on Central America, and, on the most dangerous level of all, with our chief adversary, the Soviet Union.

[.my2]
现在，国会正在制定外交政策：针对南非、针对中美洲，以及在最危险的层面上针对我们的主要对手苏联。

There is no room for mistakes in dealing with the Soviets, but Jim Wright and the House Democrats are making them.

[.my2]
与苏联打交道时不允许犯错误，但吉姆·赖特和众议院民主党人却犯了错误。

Gorbachev will arrive in Reykjavik well rested, knowing that much of his work will have already been done for him by Jim Wright.

[.my2]
戈尔巴乔夫将在休息良好的情况下抵达雷克雅未克，因为他知道吉姆·赖特已经为他完成了大部分工作。

No wonder he's bringing his wife.

[.my2]
难怪他会带上他的妻子。

There will be plenty of spare time for socializing.

[.my2]
将会有充足的空闲时间进行社交。

The Superpower leaders left Iceland this weekend without moving their nations noticeably closer to peace.

[.my2]
超级大国领导人本周末离开了冰岛，但并没有让他们的国家明显更接近和平。

But at the same time another interaction between Americans and Soviet citizens was just getting started in the USSR.

[.my2]
但与此同时，美国人和苏联公民之间的另一场互动才刚刚在苏联开始。

It is a meeting of Northern people, an Arctic attempt at understanding.

[.my2]
这是北方人民的一次聚会，是一次北极理解的尝试。

From Anchorage, reporter Joanna Urick has more on the Alaska Performing Arts for Peace.

[.my2]
来自安克雷奇的记者乔安娜·尤里克 (Joanna Urick) 报道了有关阿拉斯加和平表演艺术的更多信息。

Before Leaving for the Soviet Union, sixty Alaskans from throughout the state gathered in a log cabin on a lake outside of Anchorage to rehearse.

[.my2]
在前往苏联之前，来自全州的 60 名阿拉斯加人聚集在安克雷奇郊外湖边的一间小木屋里进行排练。

"I see people from Moscow.

[.my2]
“我看到来自莫斯科的人。

I see people from Leningrad." As John Pingyer, a Upic Eskimo reads his lines, he's thinking about an ancient Upic ceremony called "the Bladder Festival," in which people from different villages gather together.

[.my2]
我看到了来自列宁格勒的人。”当乌匹克爱斯基摩人约翰·平耶（John Pingyer）念出他的台词时，他想到了一种古老的乌匹克仪式，称为“膀胱节”，来自不同村庄的人们聚集在一起。

At the end of the week-long rituals they take the bladders from seals their hunters have taken during the past year and inflate them so they'll float.

[.my2]
在为期一周的仪式结束时，他们会从猎人在过去一年中捕获的海豹身上取出膀胱，然后给它们充气，这样它们就能漂浮起来。

Then they return the seal bladders to the ocean.

[.my2]
然后他们将海豹膀胱放回海洋。

"There's a lot of symbolism behind the ceremony.

[.my2]
“仪式背后有很多象征意义。

And one of the strongest symbolism that we're using in this Bladder Festival is …​
我们在这个膀胱节中使用的最强烈的象征意义之一是……​

togetherness of people, as one part of one big village or a community, and then we use it to portray the closeness of people, which is the peace." The Bladder Festival forms the dramatic framework for a show involving more than sixty people from Alaska.

[.my2]
人们团结在一起，作为一个大村庄或一个社区的一部分，然后我们用它来描绘人们的亲密关系，这就是和平。”膀胱节为一场由来自阿拉斯加的 60 多人参与的表演提供了戏剧性的框架。

The Alaska Performing Arts for Peace will take their show through a succession of cities, towns and villages in the Soviet Union, culminating in the reunification of Siberian Upic Eskimos, people who have lived along the coast of the Bering Sea, until the Cold War moving freely back and forth between the continents.

[.my2]
阿拉斯加和平表演艺术将在苏联的一系列城市、城镇和村庄进行演出，最终使西伯利亚乌皮克爱斯基摩人重新统一，这些人一直生活在白令海沿岸，直到冷战结束。在各大洲之间自由来回。

At times, they can see one another hunting on the ice, but actual contact has been forbidden since the coming of military installations following World War II.

[.my2]
有时，他们可以看到彼此在冰上狩猎，但自从二战后军事设施出现以来，实际接触就被禁止了。

[.my2]
阿拉斯加圣路易斯旺加村

Lawrence Island is actually closer to Siberia than to the US mainland.

[.my2]
劳伦斯岛实际上距离西伯利亚比距离美国大陆更近。

Seventy-year-old Aura Gologrogin, who accompanies the Wonga comedy players on the tour, remembers the last time she visited friends and relatives on the Siberian coast.
70 岁的奥拉·戈洛罗金 (Aura Gologrogin) 陪同旺加 (Wonga) 喜剧演员进行巡演，她还记得上次去西伯利亚海岸拜访朋友和亲戚的情景。

She's looking forward to meeting them again.

[.my2]
她期待着再次见到他们。

"Yeh, it is like a big family reunion.

[.my2]
“是的，这就像一个大家庭聚会。

I was thinking if I could meet some of the people that I know long time ago, since I have been there when I was younger.

[.my2]
我在想我是否可以见到一些我很久以前就认识的人，因为我年轻时就去过那里。

In 1940 I go over and stay there for nine days and they were so nice people.
1940 年，我去那里呆了九天，他们都是非常好的人。

And I want to meet them again." This tour is not just an Eskimo reunion.

[.my2]
我想再次见到他们。”这次旅行不仅仅是爱斯基摩人的聚会。

Along with some thirty Eskimos are chorus, cloggers, fiddlers and black gospel singers.

[.my2]
除了大约三十名爱斯基摩人之外，还有合唱团、木鞋匠、小提琴手和黑人福音歌手。

"Each culture has something unique to offer, and that's what we have here.

[.my2]
“每种文化都有其独特之处，而这正是我们这里所拥有的。

Each culture has something unique to offer, and that uniqueness will be pulled together as one.

[.my2]
每种文化都有其独特之处，而这种独特性将被整合为一个整体。

And that one body is what we are sharing with the Soviet Union." Shirley Staten is one of five gospel singers from Anchorage looking forward to another reunion with the small group of Russians, descendants of Black Americans who emigrated to Moscow during the Depression.

[.my2]
而这个身体就是我们与苏联分享的。”雪莉·斯塔顿是来自安克雷奇的五位福音歌手之一，他们期待着与一小群俄罗斯人再次团聚，这些俄罗斯人是在大萧条期间移民到莫斯科的美国黑人的后裔。

"And we're going to sit around and sing gospel music, and I am just …​
“我们会围坐在一起唱福音音乐，而我只是……​

I mean that's the highlight of the trip." "We are going to sing in chorus.

[.my2]
我的意思是，这是这次旅行的亮点。” “我们要合唱。

Then we can start together in Russian.

[.my2]
然后我们就可以一起用俄语开始。

It seems like that's the way it's going to work." Organizer Digby Belger says it's taken two difficult years to make the tour of the Alaska Performing Artists for Peace a reality.

[.my2]
看来这就是它的运作方式。”组织者迪格比·贝尔格表示，阿拉斯加和平表演艺术家的巡演花了两年的时间才成为现实。

And in that time, there have been dramatic ups and downs in US-Soviet relations.

[.my2]
在那段时间，美苏关系经历了剧烈的起伏。

"In some way, this might be a nice time to go.

[.my2]
“从某种程度上来说，这可能是一个很好的时机。

And you know, if …​
你知道，如果……​

I really feel that the more tension between us, the more that we really need to communicate.

[.my2]
我真的觉得我们之间越紧张，我们就越需要沟通。

And people to people exchange is a very good way to do that." The Alaska Performing Artists for Peace's month-long tour will take them from Moscow in the west to the Chukchi Peninsula in the east coast of Siberia.

[.my2]
人与人之间的交流是一个很好的方式。”阿拉斯加和平表演艺术家为期一个月的巡演将把他们从西部的莫斯科带到西伯利亚东海岸的楚科奇半岛。

They'll return to the United States November 2nd.

[.my2]
他们将于11月2日返回美国。

In Anchorage, this is Joanna Urich.

[.my2]
我是安克雷奇的乔安娜·乌里希。
