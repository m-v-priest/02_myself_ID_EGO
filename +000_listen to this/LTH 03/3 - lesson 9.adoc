Lesson9


There was an assassination attempt against Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi today.  +
A man fired several shots at Gandhi and other Indian leaders participating in an open-air prayer meeting.  +
Gandhi was not injured.  +
Six people received minor wounds when the gunman burst from the brushes where he had apparently hidden prior to the ceremony to avoid security checks.  +
He surrendered when guards surrounded him.  +
Those in charge of Gandhi's security have been suspended, and an investigation is under way.  +
Jess Moore, NASA's top official in charge of the shuttle program when Challenger exploded, announced today he's leaving his new post as Director of the Johnson Space Center.  +
Moore will take a leave of absence and then be reassigned to NASA headquarters in Washington.  +
NPR's Daniel Zwerdling reports.  +
"The obvious question, of course, is this: Is Jess Moore leaving his job and taking a year off work because of the Challenger accident? Moore came under quite a bit of pressure before a congressional committee early this summer when his former assistant testified that he told Moore in detail almost a year ago that there were serious problems with the shuttle rocket's O-rings, the same O-rings that eventually caused the Challenger accident.  +
That testimony flatly contradicted what Moore's been saying all along: that he did not know the O-ring problems were serious until after the Challenger exploded.  +
Congressional sources who've interviewed Moore told me that they have no way of knowing just Who's telling the truth, Moore, or Moore's former assistant.  +
But one top congressional aide who met with Morre recently says the NASA veteran's been depressed since the Challenger blew up.  +
He says, 'Moore doesn't have the edge he used to.  +
He's hollow inside, just like a lot of guys at NASA who worked on the shuttle.' 'Jess Moore,' the aide says, 'is not the man he was before the accident, and he needs a rest.' I'm Daniel Zwerdling in Washington." Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi survived an assassination attempt in New Delhi today.  +
The assailant fired a succession of shots at Gandhi, who was attending a Hindu prayer service with his wife and Indian President Zail Singh.  +
Official sources have called the incident a major security lapse.  +
Witnesses say Gandhi told security guards two times he had heard gun shots; the security forces reportedly dismissed the noise as motorcycle backfire.  +
It was over half an hour later that police finally surrounded
and captured the gunman.  +
Six people were injured during the arrest.  +
The BBC's Humphrey Hoxley reports.  +
An official statement from the Home Ministry said that those police officials who were directly responsible for the security arrangements for Mr.  +
Gandhi have been suspended from duty.  +
Senior officials in the Ministry say that a top-level investigation is under way to determine why the security around the Prime Minister, who's meant to be one of the most closely protected government leaders in the world, collapsed and how a gunman armed with an illegally manufactured revolver broke through the security cordon undetected to get within a few feet of the Prime Minister.  +
Police say the gunman who's in his twenties may even have fired at Mr.  +
Gandhi and his party as they were approaching the area to commemorate the birthday of the independence leader Mohandas Gandhi, who is cremated there.  +
The area was searched immediately; but security men failed to spot the gunman, who was hiding on top of a concrete shelter hidden among thick green vines.  +
The man opened fire again when Mr.  +
Gandhi was leaving half an hour later.  +
But when he was spotted, eyewitnesses say, he threw up his arms and shouted in Hindi, "I surrender." Police say he's not connected with any terrorist organization; nor is he part of the Sikh movement which murdered Mr.  +
Gandhi's mother, Indira, two years ago.  +

It is not just the weather with which farmers contend; there are higher costs for growing food and lower prices when selling it.  +
And these combined to make farming an increasingly difficult life, especially for small family farms.  +
In New York, a new organization called "Farm Hands" is trying to help struggling farms in the region by linking city dwellers with farmers.  +
As John Kailish reports, the scheme seems to benefit both.  +
Last week, two actors, a housewife, a tour guide, a dog walker and an unemployed social worker, all from the New York metropolitan area, spent a day working on Hall Gibson's fruit and vegetable farm located in the Upstate New York town of Brewster.  +
The contingent also included two four-year-olds.  +
The group listened attentively as Gibson gave the lengthy orientation talk complete with aerial photographs of his 125-acre farm.  +
"This area was called part of the New York milk shed.  +
One of the big incentives to producing milk in this area was the founding of the Borden plant." After the orientation talk the group walked to a five-acre field that was lined with rows of tomatoes and turnips, eggplants and cabbage.  +
Gibson gave some brief picking instructions to two women who were going to harvest cherry tomatoes.  +
"If they are split like this, throw them away or eat them." "OK." The transplanted urbanites picked six bushels of tomatoes and sixty pints of raspberries over the course of several hours.  +
The farmhands were perfect strangers when they left Manhattan, but out in the field in Putnam County, they had no trouble striking up conversations that included such heady topics as romance in television.  +
Laura Moore, a housewife and part-time teacher from Brooklyn, has made four trips to area farms with her daughter Jessie.  +
She was picking yellow low-acid tomatoes as she explained why she enjoys the Farm Hands program.
"It's therapeutic, mentally, physically, and it's exhilarating.  +
This is my way of getting out, escaping the city life for a while.  +
I love the city.  +
But in the fresh air, you get a feeling that you are really living." In addition to the one-day farm outings, Farm Hands also places individuals on farms for periods ranging from a week to several months.  +
In exchange for their labor, Participants get a minimum wage, room and board, or produce to take back with them to the city.  +
In its first year of operation, Farm Hands has placed twenty people on farms for a period of two months or longer.  +
More than two hundred people have gone on the one-day work intensives or the field trips that are often more play than work.  +
Hall Gibson has had four long term farm-hands this summer.  +
At the moment, he's benefiting from the hard work of a twenty-eight-year-old New York City painter named Debby Fisher.  +
Because Gibson's farm is organic, weeds are a major problem.  +
Farmer Gibson says that when Debby Fisher clears weeds from the fields, she works like a demon.  +
"She's been just driven to rescue crops and she's rescued a number of crops.  +
My bok choy crop-the best I've ever had-was rescued by her.  +
Debby is a gem." The Farm Hands program was founded by twenty-seven-year-old Wendy Dubid, an enthusiastic advocate of linking farms and cities.  +
In an interview at a farmers' market in New York city, Dubid said Farm Hands may mean cheap labors for farmers, but she maintains he program has a broader impact.  +
"It's not just the labor that helps those farmers; it's the appreciative consumers.  +
They suddenly realize after an hour of picking raspberries and scratching their own arms on the bramble, they understand the farm reality and the value of food, and may become valuable consumers and customers for those farmers." Dubid says there was only one Farm Hand placement that did not work out this year, a fifteen-year-old football player who antagonized his host family in Upstate New York.  +
Farmhands are currently working in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey.  +
Plans are already under way to expand the Farm Hands program to Maryland, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Vermont.



今天，印度总理拉吉夫·甘地遭到暗杀。一名男子向参加露天祈祷会的甘地和其他印度领导人开了几枪。甘地没有受伤。枪手从灌木丛中冲出来，造成六人受轻伤，他在仪式前显然是为了躲避安全检查而躲藏在灌木丛中的。当警卫包围他时，他投降了。负责甘地安全的人员已被停职，调查正在进行中。挑战者号爆炸时负责航天飞机计划的美国宇航局高级官员杰西·摩尔今天宣布，他将辞去约翰逊航天中心主任的新职务。摩尔将休假，然后被重新分配到位于华盛顿的美国宇航局总部。 NPR 的 Daniel Zwerdling 报道。 “当然，显而易见的问题是：杰西·摩尔是否会因为挑战者号事故而离职并请假一年？今年夏初，摩尔在国会委员会面前承受了相当大的压力，当时他的前助理作证说：大约一年前，他详细地告诉摩尔，航天飞机火箭的 O 形圈存在严重问题，正是这个 O 形圈最终导致了挑战者号事故。这一证词完全与摩尔一直所说的相矛盾：他不知道在挑战者号爆炸之前，O 形圈问题一直很严重。采访过摩尔的国会消息人士告诉我，他们无法知道摩尔或摩尔的前助手谁说的是实话。但一位与摩尔会面的高级国会助手莫尔最近表示，自从挑战者号爆炸以来，这位美国宇航局资深人士一直很沮丧。他说，“摩尔不再像以前那样有优势了。” 他内心空虚，就像美国宇航局许多在航天飞机上工作的人一样。” “杰西·摩尔，”助手说，“他已经不再是事故发生前的那个人了，他需要休息。”印度总理拉吉夫·甘地今天在新德里遭遇暗杀，袭击者连续向甘地连开几枪，当时甘地正在与妻子和印度总统扎伊尔·辛格一起参加印度教祈祷活动。消息人士称这起事件是重大安全漏洞。目击者称甘地两次告诉保安他听到枪声；据报道，安全部队将这种声音视为摩托车回火。半个多小时后，警察终于包围并抓获了枪手逮捕过程中有六人受伤。BBC 的汉弗莱·霍克斯利报道。内政部的一份正式声明称，那些直接负责甘地先生安全安排的警察已被停职。内政部高级官员表示正在进行一项高层调查，以确定为什么总理（他本应是世界上受到最严密保护的政府领导人之一）周围的安全崩溃，以及一名手持非法制造的左轮手枪的枪手如何闯入警察局。安全警戒线未被发现，距离总理只有几英尺。警方称，这名二十多岁的枪手甚至可能向甘地先生和他的政党开枪，当时他们正在接近该地区，纪念独立领袖莫罕达斯·甘地的生日，甘地的生日在那里被火化。立即对该地区进行了搜查；但保安人员未能发现枪手，他躲在茂密的绿色藤蔓中的混凝土掩体顶上。 半小时后，当甘地先生离开时，该男子再次开枪。但目击者称，当他被发现时，他举起双臂，用印地语大喊“我投降”。警方称他与任何恐怖组织没有联系；他也不是两年前谋杀甘地先生母亲英迪拉的锡克教运动的成员。汉弗莱·霍克斯利，BBC，德里。农民们面临的不仅仅是天气问题，还有。种植粮食的成本较高，销售价格较低。这些因素加在一起使农业生活变得越来越困难，特别是对于小型家庭农场来说。在纽约，一个名为“农场帮手”的新组织正试图通过将城市居民与农民联系起来来帮助该地区陷入困境的农场。正如约翰·凯利什报道的那样，该计划似乎对双方都有利。上周，来自纽约都会区的两名演员、一名家庭主妇、一名导游、一名遛狗者和一名失业的社会工作者，在霍尔·吉布森位于纽约州北部布鲁斯特镇的水果和蔬菜农场工作了一天。这支队伍还包括两名四岁的孩子。一行人聚精会神地聆听吉布森发表冗长的情况介绍，并附上他 125 英亩农场的航拍照片。 “这个地区被称为纽约奶棚的一部分。在这个地区生产牛奶的一大动力是博登工厂的建立。”迎新讲座结束后，一行人走到一块五英亩的田地里，田里种着一排排西红柿、萝卜、茄子和卷心菜。吉布森向两名即将采摘樱桃番茄的妇女提供了一些简短的采摘指示。 “如果像这样裂开，要么扔掉，要么吃掉。” “好的。”移居的城市居民在几个小时内采摘了六蒲式耳西红柿和六十品脱覆盆子。 当农场工人离开曼哈顿时，他们完全是陌生人，但在普特南县的田野里，他们毫不费力地展开对话，其中包括电视中的浪漫等令人兴奋的话题。来自布鲁克林的家庭主妇兼兼职教师劳拉·摩尔 (Laura Moore) 和女儿杰西 (Jessie) 曾四次前往当地农场。她正在采摘黄色的低酸西红柿，同时解释了她为什么喜欢农场帮手计划。 “这在精神上、身体上都有治疗作用，而且令人兴奋。这是我暂时逃离城市生活的方式。我喜欢这座城市。但在新鲜的空气中，你会感觉自己真正在生活。”除了一日农场郊游外，农场帮手还安排个人在农场呆一周到几个月不等。作为劳动的交换，参与者可以获得最低工资、食宿或农产品带回城市。在运营的第一年，Farm Hands 已安排 20 名员工在农场工作两个月或更长时间。超过 200 人参加了为期一天的密集工作或实地考察，这些活动通常更多的是娱乐而不是工作。霍尔·吉布森今年夏天有四名长期农场工人。目前，他正受益于一位二十八岁的纽约市画家黛比·费舍尔 (Debby Fisher) 的辛勤工作。由于吉布森的农场是有机农场，杂草是一个主要问题。农夫吉布森说，当黛比·费舍尔清除地里的杂草时，她的工作就像一个恶魔。 “她刚刚被驱赶去拯救农作物，她拯救了许多农作物。我的白菜作物——我吃过的最好的——是她拯救的。黛比是一颗宝石。”农场帮手计划由 27 岁的温迪·杜比德 (Wendy Dubid) 创立，她是连接农场和城市的热情倡导者。 在纽约市的一个农贸市场接受采访时，杜比德表示，“农场帮手”可能对农民来说意味着廉价劳动力，但她坚称该计划具有更广泛的影响。 “帮助这些农民的不仅仅是劳动力，还有有鉴赏力的消费者。他们在采摘覆盆子、在荆棘上挠自己的手臂一个小时后突然意识到，他们了解了农场的现实和食物的价值，并可能成为有价值的消费者以及这些农民的客户。”杜比德说，今年只有一个农场工人的安置没有成功，他是一名 15 岁的橄榄球运动员，他与纽约州北部的寄宿家庭发生了冲突。农场工人目前在纽约、康涅狄格州和新泽西州工作。将农场帮手计划扩展到马里兰州、宾夕法尼亚州、马萨诸塞州和佛蒙特州的计划已经在进行中。
