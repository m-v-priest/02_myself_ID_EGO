== 从太空中心离职

Jess Moore, NASA's top official *in charge of* the shuttle  航天飞机 program when Challenger exploded, announced today he's leaving his new post as Director of the Johnson Space Center.  +

Moore will *take a leave 假期；休假 of absence* 请假 and then *be reassigned 重新委派，再次指派（任务、职位、责任等） to* NASA headquarters in Washington.  +

NPR's Daniel Zwerdling reports.  +

"The obvious question, of course, is this: Is Jess Moore leaving his job and *taking a year off work* 不工作，即不在工作状态 because of the Challenger accident? Moore came *under quite a bit of pressure* before a congressional committee early this summer when his former assistant *testified (v.) that* he *told* Moore in detail almost a year ago *that* there were serious problems with *the shuttle rocket's* O-rings, the same O-rings that eventually caused the Challenger accident.  +

当然，显而易见的问题是：
杰斯·穆尔离开他的工作岗位，休假一年，是因为挑战者号事故吗？
今年夏初，在国会委员会的重重压力面前，更多详情暴露出来，
他的前助手作证说，他几乎一年前就详细告知穆尔，航天飞机的O形环存在严重问题。
而最终导致挑战者号发生事故的正是那几个O形环。 +

That testimony 证词；证言；口供 *flatly  断然；斩钉截铁地 contradicted* 反驳；驳斥；批驳;相抵触；相矛盾；相反 what Moore's been saying *all along* 自始至终，一直: that he did not know the O-ring problems were serious until after the Challenger exploded.  +

`主` Congressional sources 来源；出处;信息来源；原始资料 who've interviewed Moore `谓` told me that they *have no way 没有办法 of* knowing just Who's telling the truth, Moore, or Moore's former assistant.  +
国会人士已经采访过穆尔，并告诉我，他们无法获知谁说的是真话，
穆尔，还是穆尔以前的助手。 +

But `主` one *top congressional aide* （尤指从政者的）助手 who *met with* Morre recently `谓` says the NASA veteran's been depressed since the Challenger *blew up*.  +
但是最近与穆尔会面的一位国会高级助手
说自从挑战者号爆炸以来，NASA的老员工们一直很沮丧。 +

He says, 'Moore doesn't have the edge （微弱的）优势 he used to.  +
说自从挑战者号爆炸以来，NASA的老员工们一直很沮丧。 +

He's hollow 中空的；空心的 inside, just like a lot of guys at NASA who worked on the shuttle.' 'Jess Moore,' the aide says, 'is not the man *he was before the accident*, and he needs a rest.'

I'm Daniel Zwerdling in Washington."

Senior officials in the Ministry say that a top-level investigation *is under way* to determine why the security around the Prime Minister, who'*s meant (v.)被普遍认为是 to be* one of the most closely 仔细地，严密地 protected government leaders in the world, collapsed and how a gunman armed with an illegally manufactured revolver 左轮手枪 *broke through* the security cordon （由警察、士兵等组成的）警戒线，封锁线 undetected 未被发现的；未检测到的; 未被注意的 to get within a few feet of the Prime Minister.  +

The area was searched immediately; but security men failed to spot the gunman, who was hiding *on top of* a concrete shelter （尤指用以躲避风雨或攻击的）遮蔽物，庇护处，避难处 *hidden among* thick green vines 葡萄属植物.  +
该区域立即受到搜查；但是保安人员并没有发现持枪歹徒，
持枪歹徒当时藏匿在混凝土掩体顶部，躲在厚厚的绿色藤蔓之中。 +

The man opened fire again when Mr. Gandhi was leaving half an hour later.  +

But when he was spotted, eyewitnesses 目击者 say, he *threw up* 使显眼；使引起注意 his arms and shouted in Hindi, "I surrender." Police say he's *not connected with* any terrorist organization; nor *is* he *part of* the Sikh movement which murdered Mr. Gandhi's mother, Indira, two years ago.  +

但目击者说，当他被发现时，他举起双臂用印地语喊着：“我投降。”
警方说他与恐怖组织没有任何瓜葛；
也不是锡克教运动成员，而后者在两年前杀害了甘地的母亲，英迪拉. +
