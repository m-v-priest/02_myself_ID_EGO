Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said today that some Soviet troops will begin pulling out of Afghanistan within a few days.  +
The remarks came during a news conference held in Ottawa.  +
Shevardnadze told reporters, "We would like to see our boys back home as soon as possible." Shevardnadze is now in Mexico where he will meet with top government officials over the weekend.  +
The next space shuttle mission is planned for lift-off on February 18th, 1988.  +
Today NASA announced its schedule of launches for the next 7 years.  +
NPR's Daniel Zwerding reports: "The new launch schedule is pretty much what NASA's been predicting since shortly after the challenger exploded, NASA administrator James Fletcher said the agency will shoot for only five shuttle launches the first year, 1988, and that's less
than half the number that NASA had been planning for this year until the accident happened.  +
Fletcher said NASA will slowly work its way up to 16 launches a year in the early 1990s.  +
And as administration officials have been predicting, those shuttles will carry a much different mix of cargoes than the shuttles of the past.  +
For at least the first three years, military projects will fill more than half the flight.  +
The Pentagon is way behind launching secret Star Wars tests and military communication satellites.  +
NASA space exploration projects will get next priority, such as the Galileo and Ulysses satellites to study Jupiter and the sun.  +
And commercial business satellites, which were originally supposed to be the financial backbone of the shuttle program, will get only a small fraction of the space in the shuttle cargo bays.  +
I'm Daniel Zwerdling in Washington." There are reports today that John Zaccaro, husband of former presidential candidate, Geraldine Ferarro, has been indicted by a local grand jury in Queens, New York.  +
The Associated Press and United Press International quote a source close to a criminal investigation of Zaccaro, saying the indictment is the result of a probe of bribery allegations in the awarding of cable television contracts.  +
The grand jury has been investigating the activities of Zaccaro and Michael Nussbaum, Campaign Manager of the late Queens Borough President, Donald Mannis.  +
If you want to watch the next space shuttle take-off, mark your calendar for February 18th, 1988.  +
That is according to NASA's official new 7-year space shuttle schedule announced today.  +
NPR's Daniel Zwerdling reports: "During the first year, 1988, the agency plans to launch only 5 shuttles, less than half the number they'd been planning to launch this year until the Challenger accident happened.  +
In 1989, they'll launch 10 shuttles, and then slowly work their way up to 16 flights a year in the early '90s.  +
By then, the Agency officials said today, they'll have built the new 4th safer shuttle although they don't know yet exactly where they'll get the money and they'll start building a permanent space station.  +
The new shuttle program looks a lot more sober than the previous one did.  +
"No," said NASA administrator James Fletcher, "there are no specific plans to send up another teacher or journalist.  +
Until the Challenger exploded, of course, NASA was holding a widely publicized competition to send a reporter into space." "There's a lot of opposition from some quarters to flying any so-called civilians in space, but my bias is, that yes, in time, civilians will be flying again back in space, but certainly not in the first year.  +
I think we want to get our act together first before we start taking a risk of that sort.  +
And as administrative officials have been predicting, the shuttles will carry a much different mix of cargoes than NASA had been planning until the accident.  +
The military will be much more prominent than ever before.  +
For at least the first two years, the Pentagon will fill more than half the shuttle flights with secret Star Wars tests and military communication satellites.  +
NASA space exploration projects will get next priority, such as the Hubble Telescope, which will see closer to
the edges of the universe than any telescope in the past.  +
As for commercial business satellites, which were originally supposed to be the financial backbone of the program, most of them will be bumped for lack of space.  +
Under President Reagan's orders, all commercial space cargo launched in the US will eventually have to fly on private industries' own rockets.  +
I'm Daniel Zwerdling in Washington." Forbes magazine yesterday published its annual list of the 400 wealthiest people in America.  +
Sam Moore Walton, founder of the Wal-Mart Department Store chain heads the list for the second year in a row with a total worth of 4.5 billion dollars.  +
Other familiar names on the list include chicken producer Frank Perdue; fashion designer Ralph Lauren, and TV producers Merv Griffin and Dick Clark, each worth more than the minimum $180,000,000 needed to get on the list.  +
That minimum figure was up from 150,000,000 last year.  +
Also the number of billionaires jumped from 14 to 26.  +
We asked Forbes' Editor Harry Seneker to help us interpret those figures.  +
"Well, it shows that the rich do get richer, and it also shows that we've been doing a little more of our homework each year.  +
It's quite a lot of work to refine your estimates of what people's assets are worth when they are not very eager to co-operate with you.  +
And each year we get a little better.  +
Each year we find a few new ones that we'd missed before." "And some people are left off this list because they don't co-operate, Malcolm Forbes, for one." "Oh no, he's in there.  +
It's just that we wouldn't for the life of us, say exactly where." "You started this list about 5 years ago.  +
Why did it start? Why do you continue to do it?" "Why? Well, it started … the short answer for why it started is that Malcolm Forbes thought that people would be interested in it and insisted on us doing it and doing it right." "But he didn't want to cooperate himself." "Well, you run into certain problems with the IRS and inheritance taxes if you put a number on yourself.  +
You want to negotiate that figure, or your heirs do." "Is there any commonality to how these people have achieved such wealth? Did they earn it the old-fashioned way?" "Well, at some point, everybody, every fortune had to be earned the old-fashioned way.  +
And the old-fashioned way is, you set up a business that can be multiplied indefinitely beyond the limitations of your own personal efforts.  +
It can be an oil business, like John D.  +
Rockefeller did with the Standard Oil Trust.  +
It could be, you know, an organization that can produce dozens of game shows like Merv Griffin." "But of most of them that are on the list, say, this year, are they new to the list, new wealth, or is this mostly inherited fortunes?" "There's a mix of both.  +
You know, the new arrivals are mostly new wealth.  +
Every once in a while, we find a branch of an old family that we really should have included.  +
And this year we found a few Melons out there in Pittsburgh."
"Who's the youngest on the list this year?" "One of those.  +
His name is Michael Carrier.  +
But, you know, he goes back to the Melons on his mother's side." "And he is how old?" "He's twenty-five." "And how much is he worth?" "On the order of a couple of hundred million dollars.  +
You should understand with people like the Melons, it is enormously hard to get a sense of just how much is out there.  +
We think we're being conservative with that figure." "What about the oldest? Who's the oldest on the list?" "The oldest is a lady named Dorothy Stimson Bullit.  +
And she's known out in the Washington State.  +
She has some radio stations and real estate out there.  +
The lady is ninety-four." "Do you get any mail response from this? People write in and have comments about it?" "We get people writing in saying, 'Gee, you missed so-and-so.' Once in a while, we get somebody who writes in and says, 'You missed me.' He's usually exaggerating." Harry Seneker, Senior Editor of Forbes magazine.


苏联外交部长爱德华·谢瓦尔德纳泽今天表示，部分苏联军队将在几天内开始从阿富汗撤军。上述言论是在渥太华举行的新闻发布会上发表的。谢瓦尔德纳泽告诉记者：“我们希望尽快看到我们的孩子们回家。”谢瓦尔德纳泽目前正在墨西哥，他将在周末与政府高级官员会面。下一次航天飞机任务计划于 1988 年 2 月 18 日升空。今天，美国宇航局 (NASA) 宣布了未来 7 年的发射时间表。 NPR 的 Daniel Zwerding 报道称：“新的发射时间表与 NASA 自挑战者号爆炸后不久就开始预测的差不多，NASA 局长詹姆斯·弗莱彻 (James Fletcher) 表示，该机构将在第一年（即 1988 年）只进行五次航天飞机发射，这还不到 1988 年的一半。”直到事故发生之前，NASA 一直在计划今年的发射次数。弗莱彻表示，在 20 世纪 90 年代初，NASA 将慢慢将发射次数增加到每年 16 次。正如政府官员一直预测的那样，这些航天飞机将携带多种不同的货物比过去的航天飞机。至少在前三年，军事项目将占据一半以上的航班。五角大楼远远落后于发射秘密星球大战测试和军事通信卫星。美国宇航局太空探索项目将成为下一个优先事项，例如用于研究木星和太阳的伽利略卫星和尤利西斯卫星。而原本被认为是航天飞机计划的财务支柱的商业卫星将只占据航天飞机货舱的一小部分空间。我是华盛顿的 Daniel Zwerdling。今天有报道称，前总统候选人杰拉尔丁·费拉罗的丈夫约翰·扎卡罗已被纽约皇后区当地大陪审团起诉。美联社和合众社国际社援引一位接近扎卡罗刑事调查的消息人士的话称，称起诉书是对有线电视合同授予中的贿赂指控进行调查的结果。大陪审团一直在调查扎卡罗和已故皇后区主席唐纳德·曼尼斯的竞选经理迈克尔·努斯鲍姆的活动。如果你想观看下一次航天飞机的起飞，将你的日历标记为 1988 年 2 月 18 日。这是根据 NASA 今天宣布的官方新的 7 年航天飞机时间表。NPR 的 Daniel Zwerdling 报道：“在第一年，即 1988 年，该机构计划只发射 5 架航天飞机，不到挑战者号事故发生前他们今年计划发射的航天飞机数量的一半。 1989 年，他们将发射 10 架航天飞机，然后在 90 年代初慢慢增加到每年 16 架次。该机构官员今天表示，到那时，他们将建造第四艘更安全的新航天飞机，尽管他们还不知道具体从哪里获得资金，并且他们将开始建造一个永久性空间站。新的航天飞机计划看起来比之前的要清醒得多。 “不，”美国宇航局局长詹姆斯·弗莱彻说，“目前还没有派遣另一名教师或记者的具体计划。当然，在挑战者号爆炸之前，美国宇航局一直在举办一场广泛宣传的竞赛，以将一名记者送入太空。” “某些方面对任何所谓的平民飞入太空有很多反对意见，但我的偏见是，是的，随着时间的推移，平民将再次飞回太空，但肯定不是在第一年。 我认为，在我们开始承担此类风险之前，我们首先要齐心协力。正如行政官员所预测的那样，航天飞机将运载的货物组合与美国宇航局在事故发生前的计划截然不同。军队将比以往任何时候都更加突出。至少在前两年，五角大楼将在超过一半的航天飞机飞行中进行秘密星球大战测试和军事通信卫星。美国宇航局的太空探索项目将得到下一个优先考虑，例如哈勃望远镜，它将比过去的任何望远镜都更接近宇宙的边缘。至于商业卫星，原本是该计划的财务支柱，但大多数都将因空间不足而被搁置。根据里根总统的命令，所有在美国发射的商业太空货物最终都必须使用私营企业自己的火箭飞行。昨天，《福布斯》杂志公布了美国 400 名最富有人士的年度排行榜。沃尔玛连锁店创始人山姆·摩尔·沃尔顿 (Sam Moore Walton) 连续第二年位居榜首，总财富价值 45 亿美元。名单上其他熟悉的名字包括鸡肉生产商 Frank Perdue、时装设计师 Ralph Lauren、电视制作人 Merv Griffin 和 Dick Clark，每个人的身价都超过了上榜所需的最低 1.8 亿美元。这个最低数字是从去年的 1.5 亿增加到了亿万富翁的数量，亿万富翁的数量也从 14 人跃升至 26 人。我们请《福布斯》编辑哈里·塞内克 (Harry Seneker) 帮助我们解读这些数字。每年我们都会多做一点作业。 当人们不太愿意与你合作时，要完善你对他们资产价值的估计需要做大量的工作。每年我们都会变得更好一点。每年我们都会发现一些以前错过的新内容。” “有些人被排除在这个名单之外是因为他们不合作，马尔科姆·福布斯就是其中之一。” “哦不，他就在那里。只是我们一辈子都不愿意说出具体地点。” “你大约 5 年前开始列出这个清单。为什么开始呢？你为什么还要继续这样做？” “为什么？嗯，它开始了……对于它开始的原因的简短回答是，马尔科姆·福布斯认为人们会对它感兴趣，并坚持要求我们这样做，并且做得正确。” “但他自己不想合作。” “好吧，如果你给自己加上一个数字，你会遇到国税局和遗产税的某些问题。你想要协商这个数字，或者你的继承人想要协商。” “这些人如何获得如此财富有什么共同点吗？他们是用老式的方式赚来的吗？” “嗯，在某个时刻，每个人、每一份财富都必须用老式的方式来赚取。老式的方式是，你建立了一家可以无限倍增的企业，超越你个人努力的限制。它可以是一项石油业务，就像约翰·D·洛克菲勒对标准石油信托公司所做的那样。你知道，它可能是一个可以制作几十个像梅尔夫·格里芬那样的游戏节目的组织。”这主要是继承的财富？” “两者都有。要知道，新来的大多是新富。每隔一段时间，我们就会发现一个我们确实应该包括在内的古老家族的分支。今年我们在匹兹堡发现了一些甜瓜。” “今年名单上最年轻的是谁？” “其中一个。他的名字叫迈克尔·开利。但是，你知道，他回到了他母亲那一边。” “他多大了？” “他二十五岁了。” “他值多少钱？” “大约几百块钱。百万美元。你应该明白，对于像 Melons 这样的人来说，要了解外面到底有多少东西是非常困难的。我们认为我们对这个数字比较保守。” “那最年长的呢？名单上最年长的是谁？” “最年长的是一位名叫多萝西·史汀生·布利特 (Dorothy Stimson Bullit) 的女士。她在华盛顿州很有名。她在那里有一些广播电台和房地产。这位女士九十四岁了。” “你收到邮件回复了吗？人们写信并对此发表评论？”“我们收到人们写信说，‘哎呀，你错过了某某。’偶尔，我们会收到有人写信说：“你想念我。”他通常很夸张。”哈里·塞内克，《福布斯》杂志高级编辑。
