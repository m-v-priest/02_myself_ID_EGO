President Reagan announced today that he and Soviet leader Gobachev will meet in Iceland October 11th and 12th to prepare for a summit between the two leaders in the United States later this year.  +
The announcement came after the release yesterday
from Moscow of American reporter Nicholas Daniloff and a court appearance in New York this morning by accused Soviet spy Gennadi Zakharov, who pleaded no contest to espionage charges and was told to leave the United States within twenty-four hours.  +
Zakharov is now on his way back to the Soviet Union and Daniloff has arrived back in the United States.  +
The movement of Daniloff and Zakharov and plans for the meeting in Iceland were also announced today in Moscow.  +
The BBC's Peter Ruff reports.  +
"The announcement makes it clear that this was at Mr.  +
Gorbachev's invitation, and it's also pointed out that this is simply a preparatory meeting to a possible summit.  +
It's pointed out here that it will enable the Soviet Union to focus on arms issues, particularly the Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars program, President Reagan's refusal to join a test moratorium, and a possible arms deal involving medium-range missiles in Europe.  +
In a separate announcement, the official news agency Tass revealed that Gennadi Zakharov had, as they put it, been released from custody and was returning home.  +
It made no mention of the fact that he'd pleaded no contest in a court in New York.  +
Then came the first official confirmation from the Soviet Union that the American reporter Nicholas Daniloff had been expelled.  +
The news item did not refer to him as a spy but as someone who'd been engaged in inadmissible activity." BBC correspondent Peter Ruff in Moscow.  +
There was no mention in the Soviet press today that prominent Soviet dissident Yuri Orlov and his wife will be allowed to leave for the United States by October 7th.  +
Secretary of State Shultz made that announcement in Washington saying Orlov was the driving force behind the Helsinki Monitoring Group of Civil Rights Activists.  +
In 1978, Orlov was sentenced to seven years in a prison camp to be followed by five more years in internal exile.  +
Shultz said Orlov's release was in exchange for that Zakharov and had nothing to do with Daniloff's freedom.  +
In just eleven days President Reagan and Soviet leader Gorbachev will meet in Iceland for what is described by the two sides as an interim summit or a preparatory summit.  +
The announcement was made at the White House this morning at a news conference held by President Reagen and Secretary of State George Shultz called to discuss the Iceland meeting and the negotiations which had led up to the release of Nicholas Daniloff yesterday.  +
Negotiations for the release of Daniloff went on for over a month.  +
Today, at the same time that the White House news conference was going on, Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze met with the press in New York.  +
NPR's Jim Angle was at the White House, and Mike Shuster was with the Soviet Foreign Minister.  +
"Jim, since Daniloff was only released yesterday, and the details of the negotiations leading up to his release were not known yesterday, didn't announcement of a summit announced before any discussion of the Daniloff affair come as a surprise?" "What was a surprise is that we did not know it was coming.  +
It is not a surprise if you look at the overall context of preparations for a summit and the discussions so far.  +
Of
course, the US had said it would not attend a summit until the Daniloff case was resolved, and the President said today that he could not have accepted this pre-summit preparatory meeting if Daniloff were still being held.  +
Today the matter was resolved.  +
At least we heard that the other details of the matter's resolution, including the fact that Gennadi Zakharov, the accused Soviet spy, was allowed to plead no contest in a New York court and allowed to leave the United States.  +
The resolution of that matter cleared the way for summit preparations.  +
The meeting, of course, this pre-summit meeting, was proposed by Secretary Gorbachev, in a letter delivered to President Reagan by Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze on September 19th.  +
The announcement of this meeting today at the same time as the resolution of Zakharov's status is a way of both sides saying that they consider the Daniloff matter resolved with the exception of one or two details and that no obstacles now exist in the preparations for summit later this year in the US." "At the news conference this morning both President Reagan and Secretary of State Shultz stress that there had been no trade for Nicholas Daniloff.  +
Jim, was this a trade?" "Well, clearly, Daniloff's release, Zakharov's quick trial and departure, and the release of the Soviet dissident were all part of one package.  +
But to the extent that definitions are important, especially in the diplomatic world and in terms of principles and precedents, the US has insisted that there was no trade involved here.  +
They say Daniloff was released without a trial, an implicit acknowledgement, if you will, by the Soviet, that he is not a spy.  +
Zakharov, on the other hand, in pleading no contest to espionage charges, allows, in a sense, the US assertion that he was a spy to stand.  +
President Reagan sought to emphasize today in his remark at the White House that these were separate matters.  +
"There is no connection between these two releases.  +
And I don't know just what you have said so far about this.  +
But there were other arrangements with regard to Zakharov that resulted in his being freed." Margo, the President's referring there to what the US sees as the only trade involved in this whole package, and that is the Soviet agreement to allow Soviet human rights activist Yuri Orlov and his wife to leave the Soviet Union by October 7th." Today in the Supreme Court of the United States, a case involving maternity leave: at issue whether states may require employers to guarantee that pregnant workers are able to return to their jobs after a limited period of unpaid disability leave.  +
NPR's Nina Totenberg reports.  +
Nice states already have laws or regulations that require all employers to protect the jobs of workers who are disabled by pregnancy or childbirth.  +
Depending on what the Supreme Court rules in the case it heard today, those laws will either die or flourish.  +
The test case is from California.  +
It began with Lillian Garland, the receptionist at California Federal Savings and Loan.  +
In 1982, she returned to work after having a child and found she had no job.  +
"After working for California Federal for over three and a half years, I was told at that time they no longer had a position available for me.  +
My question was, 'Well, what
about the job that I've had for so many years?' And they said, 'We hired the person that you trained in your place.' I was in shock." Officials at California Federal say Garland should not have been surprised, that she'd been told at the time she took pregnancy leave that her job was not guaranteed.  +
But the fact is that California law requires all employers in the state to provide up to four months' disability leave for pregnant workers.  +
The leave time is unpaid, and it is only a available to women who, because of pregnancy or childbirth, are physically unable to work.  +
The law does require that such workers get back the same job unless business necessity makes that impossible.  +
So when Lillian Garland was told she couldn't have her old job back, she filed discrimination charges against the bank.  +
The bank then challenged the California pregnancy disability law in court, claiming that the state law amounted to illegal sex discrimination.  +
The bank's reasoning went like this: Federal law bans discrimination in employment based on pregnancy, but the state law mandates disability leave to women for pregnancy while denying the same leave time to men who are disabled by other ailments, such as heart attacks and strokes.  +
California counters that the state law does not discriminate between men and women, that it treats them both the same as to all ailments, but grants disability leave only to pregnant workers.  +
Moreover, California argues that the state law in fact equalizes the situation between man and woman, allowing them both to have children without losing their jobs.  +
The pregnancy disability case has produced some strange bedfellows.  +
The Reagan Administration is siding with the California business community in arguing that federal law requires no special treatment for pregnancy.  +
Many of the major national women's organizations agree, but argue that the way to cure the problem is to give everybody unpaid disability leave in case of illness.  +
Other women's organizations, particularly in California, argue that singling out pregnancy for special treatment is not sex discrimination.  +
Feminist Betty Friedan defends the California law.  +
"It's not discrimination against men to do something about the fact that women give birth to children.  +
It's a fact of life.  +
If men could carry the baby, if men could go through the nine months, if men could have the labor pain, you know, they also should have coverage for pregnancy.  +
You're not discriminating against men; you're recognizing a fact of life: that women are different than men." On the other side, the lawyer for the bank, Ted Olson, argues that special treatment for pregnancy is obviously discrimination, and that California companies risk being sued by one group of people if they follow federal law and by another group of people if they follow state law.  +
"The California law requires special treatment of pregnancy; the federal law requires equal treatment of pregnancy.  +
An employer is entitled to know which law it must follow." The fact is, though, that much of the California business community objects, most of all, to being told that it has to provide any disability leave.  +
Here is Don Butler, President of the Merchants and Manufacturers Association, which is a party to this law suit.  +
"What we have to get back to, though, is who's going to set the disability leave
policies.  +
Is the federal government, is the state of California, or are we, the employers, going to set? You, the employee, have the choice of working for our company under the following conditions or working for another company under other conditions.  +
And I believe that that was what built this country to be a great free enterprise system.  +
And if we're going to legislate it, then we're going to destroy a lot of the incentives to ..." "But basically you don't want to be told to have a disability policy at all." "Right." In the Supreme Court this morning, perhaps the pivotal question was asked by Justice Louis Powell, who posed a hypothetical situation to California Deputy Attorney General Marion Johnston.  +
"Let assume, " said Jusstice Powell, "that a man and a woman in the same company leave their jobs on the same day: he, because he is ill; she, because she's about to have a child.  +
And they return on the same day, but under the California law she gets her job back and he does not.  +
Is that fair?" asks Justice Powell.  +
Lawyer Johnston responded, "It may not be fair, but it's legal.  +
California law," she said, "simply requires that employers treat all their employees, men and women, in the same way with respect to pregnancy.  +
But, since men don't get pregnant, they don't get the time off." A decision in the California case is not expected until next year.  +

里根总统今天宣布，他和苏联领导人戈巴乔夫将于10月11日至12日在冰岛会面，为今年晚些时候两国领导人在美国举行的峰会做准备。昨天，美国记者尼古拉斯·达尼洛夫从莫斯科被释放，被指控的苏联间谍根纳迪·扎哈罗夫今天早上在纽约出庭，他对间谍指控不予抗辩，并被告知在二十四小时内离开美国。 。扎哈罗夫目前正在返回苏联的途中，达尼洛夫已返回美国。今天在莫斯科还宣布了达尼洛夫和扎哈罗夫的动向以及冰岛会议的计划。 BBC 的彼得·拉夫报道。 “声明明确表明这是应戈尔巴乔夫先生的邀请，并指出这只是一次可能举行的峰会的筹备会议。这里指出，这将使苏联能够集中精力处理武器问题，特别是军备问题。” ”说，已被释放并正在回国。它没有提到他在纽约法庭上没有提出抗辩的事实。然后来自苏联的第一个官方确认，美国记者尼古拉斯·达尼洛夫（Nicholas Daniloff）被驱逐了。新闻报道并没有称他为间谍，而是称他为从事不可接受活动的人。” BBC 驻莫斯科记者彼得·拉夫。 今天的苏联媒体没有提到著名的苏联异见人士尤里·奥尔洛夫和他的妻子将被允许在 10 月 7 日之前前往美国。国务卿舒尔茨在华盛顿宣布这一消息，称奥尔洛夫是赫尔辛基民权活动人士监测小组的幕后推动者。 1978 年，奥尔洛夫被判处七年监禁，随后又被判处五年国内流放。舒尔茨表示，奥尔洛夫的获释是换取扎哈罗夫的条件，与达尼洛夫的自由无关。短短十一天后，里根总统和苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫将在冰岛会面，双方称这是一次临时峰会或预备峰会。今天上午，里根总统和国务卿乔治·舒尔茨在白宫举行的新闻发布会上宣布了这一消息，会议讨论了冰岛会议以及导致尼古拉斯·达尼洛夫昨天获释的谈判。释放达尼洛夫的谈判持续了一个多月。今天，在白宫举行新闻发布会的同时，苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽在纽约会见了记者。 NPR 的吉姆·安格尔 (Jim Angle) 在白宫，迈克·舒斯特 (Mike Shuster) 则与苏联外交部长在一起。 “吉姆，由于达尼洛夫昨天才被释放，昨天还不知道导致他获释的谈判细节，在讨论达尼洛夫事件之前就宣布举行峰会，这难道不让人感到意外吗？” “令人惊讶的是，我们并不知道它会到来。如果你看看峰会准备工作和迄今为止讨论的整体背景，那就不足为奇了。 当然，美方曾表示，在达尼洛夫案得到解决之前不会参加峰会，而总统今天表示，如果达尼洛夫案仍然被关押，他就不可能接受这次峰会前的准备会议。今天，事情得到了解决。至少我们听说了该案解决的其他细节，包括被指控的苏联间谍根纳季·扎哈罗夫被允许在纽约法院不提出异议并被允许离开美国。该问题的解决为峰会筹备工作扫清了道路。当然，这次会议，即峰会前的会议，是由戈尔巴乔夫国务卿在苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽9月19日致里根总统的信中提议的。今天在解决扎哈罗夫地位问题的同时宣布举行这次会晤，是双方表示认为丹尼洛夫问题除一两个细节外已得到解决，并且目前为后续峰会的准备工作不存在任何障碍的一种方式。今年在美国。” “在今天早上的新闻发布会上，里根总统和国务卿舒尔茨都强调，尼古拉斯·达尼洛夫没有被交易。吉姆，这是一笔交易吗？” “嗯，很明显，达尼洛夫的释放、扎哈罗夫的快速审判和离开，以及苏联持不同政见者的释放都是一揽子计划的一部分。但就定义的重要性而言，尤其是在外交领域以及原则和先例方面，美国坚称这里不涉及贸易。他们说，达尼洛夫未经审判就被释放，如果你愿意的话，苏联就含蓄地承认他不是间谍。 另一方面，扎哈罗夫对间谍指控不提出抗辩，从某种意义上说，允许美国关于他是间谍的说法成立。里根总统今天在白宫发表讲话时试图强调，这些是不同的问题。 “这两次释放之间没有联系。我不知道你到目前为止对此说了些什么。但是关于扎哈罗夫还有其他安排导致他被释放。”马戈，总统在这里提到了美国认为整个一揽子计划中涉及的唯一贸易，那就是苏联同意允许苏联人权活动人士尤里·奥尔洛夫和他的妻子在 10 月 7 日之前离开苏联。”美国最高法院，涉及产假的案件：各州是否可以要求雇主保证怀孕工人能够在一段有限的无薪伤残假后重返工作岗位的问题。NPR 的 Nina Totenberg 报道。尼斯州已经制定法律或法规，要求所有雇主保护因怀孕或分娩而致残的工人的工作。根据最高法院今天审理的案件的裁决，这些法律要么消亡，要么蓬勃发展。测试案例来自加利福尼亚州事情要从加州联邦储蓄贷款银行的接待员莉莲·加兰说起。1982年，她生完孩子后重返工作岗位，却发现自己没有工作。“在加州联邦储蓄贷款银行工作了三年半多后，我当时告诉我他们不再有空缺的职位了。我的问题是，“那么，我从事了这么多年的工作呢？”他们说，“我们雇佣了你在你的位置上培训的人。”我很震惊。加州联邦官员表示，加兰不应该感到惊讶，因为她在休产假时被告知她的工作没有保障。但事实是，加州法律要求该州所有雇主提供最多怀孕工人可以享受四个月的伤残假。该休假时间是无薪的，并且仅适用于因怀孕或分娩而身体无法工作的妇女。法律确实要求此类工人返回原来的工作，除非商业需要使得这成为不可能。因此，当莉莲·加兰被告知她无法恢复原来的工作时，她向该银行提出了歧视指控。该银行随后在法庭上对加州怀孕残疾法提出质疑，声称该州法律相当于非法性别歧视。该银行的理由是这样的：联邦法律禁止基于怀孕的就业歧视，但州法律规定女性怀孕期间可以休伤残假，而患有心脏病等其他疾病的男性却无法享受同样的休假时间和笔画。加州反驳说，该州法律不歧视男性和女性，对所有疾病都一视同仁，但只给予怀孕工人伤残假。此外，加利福尼亚州认为，该州法律实际上平等了男女之间的地位，允许他们在不失业的情况下生孩子。怀孕残疾事件产生了一些奇怪的伙伴。里根政府站在加州商界一边，认为联邦法律不要求对怀孕给予特殊待遇。 许多主要的全国性妇女组织都同意这一观点，但认为解决这个问题的方法是让每个人在生病时都可以享受无薪伤残假。其他妇女组织，尤其是加利福尼亚州的妇女组织，认为将怀孕作为特殊待遇并不是性别歧视。女权主义者贝蒂·弗里丹捍卫加州法律。 “针对女性生孩子的事实采取行动并不是对男性的歧视。这是生活的事实。如果男人可以怀孩子，如果男人可以度过九个月，如果男人可以承受分娩的痛苦，你要知道，他们也应该有怀孕保险。你不是在歧视男性；你是在认识到一个生活事实：女性与男性不同。”另一方面，该银行的律师泰德·奥尔森（Ted Olson）认为，对怀孕的特殊待遇显然是歧视，加州的公司如果遵守联邦法律，就有可能被一群人起诉，如果遵守联邦法律，就有可能被另一群人起诉。国家法律。 “加州法律要求对怀孕给予特殊待遇；联邦法律要求对怀孕给予平等待遇。雇主有权知道必须遵守哪条法律。”但事实是，加州商界的大部分人都反对被告知必须提供伤残假。以下是商人和​​制造商协会主席唐·巴特勒的报道，该协会是这起诉讼的当事人。 “不过，我们必须回到谁来制定伤残假政策。是联邦政府、加利福尼亚州，还是我们（雇主）来制定？你，雇员，有权力制定？”符合以下条件可选择在本公司工作或在其他条件下选择在其他公司工作。 我相信这就是让这个国家成为一个伟大的自由企业制度的原因。如果我们要立法，那么我们就会破坏很多激励措施......”“但基本上你根本不想被告知要制定残疾人政策。”“对。”今天早上在最高法院，也许关键问题是由路易斯·鲍威尔法官提出的，他向加州副总检察长马里恩·约翰斯顿提出了一个假设的情况。“让我们假设，”鲍威尔法官说，“一个男人和一个女人在同一个地方公司当天下岗：他，因为生病了；她，因为她快要生孩子了。他们在同一天返回，但根据加州法律，她恢复了工作，而他却没有。这公平吗？”鲍威尔法官问道。约翰斯顿律师回答说：“这可能不公平，但这是合法的。加州法律，”她说，“只是要求雇主在怀孕方面以同样的方式对待所有雇员，无论男女。但是，由于男性不会怀孕，所以他们没有休息时间。”加州案件预计要到明年才会做出决定。我是华盛顿的尼娜·托滕伯格。
