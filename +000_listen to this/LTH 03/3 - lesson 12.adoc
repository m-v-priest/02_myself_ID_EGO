I was arrested without an arrest warrant 执行令；授权令.  +

[.my2]
整件事情完全捏造，其目的就是为扎哈罗夫的纽约案件施加政治影响力，这就是苏联狭隘的政治目的。 +


The KGB did not punish me; the KGB punished itself.  +

I cannot tell you anything about any other arrangements.  +

*All I know is that* I am free in the West, very grateful, delighted to see you." Nicholas Daniloff.  +

When Daniloff left the Soviet Union today he had been detained there for thirty-one days, facing a possible trial （法院的）审讯，审理，审判 on espionage 间谍活动 charges.  +

到目前为止，关于丹尼洛夫一事谈判的具体协议，白宫和国务院均未有任何观点发表。 +

[.my1]
====
.So far though ...
这里的 "though" 在原句中的作用是引入对比或让步，表示**尽管**到目前为止还没有公开谈论具体的协议.
====


And lacking any fuller explanation from the government, many questions remain.  +

First, *what will happen to* the Russian scientist Gennadi Zakharov `主` whose arrest last month in New York for spying `谓` *led to* Daniloff's detention? *No date has been set* for Zakharov's trial in Brooklyn, and `主` *a representative of the Justice Department* in Brooklyn `谓` said today *the US attorney* there *was waiting for instructions* on the handling of Zakharov's case.  +
[.my2]
首先，俄罗斯科学家根纳季·扎哈罗夫的命运,  将如何走向？根纳季·扎哈罗夫上个月在纽约, 因间谍活动遭到逮捕，导致了丹尼洛夫扣押。扎哈罗夫在布鲁克林区的审判日期, 还没有确定，而布鲁克林区司法代表, 今天表示，美国律师正在等待对扎哈罗夫案件的处理指示。 +




*There have been suggestions that* Zakharov might be returned to the Soviet Union *at a later date* in exchange for one or more jailed Soviet dissidents.  +
[.my2]
有人建议，扎哈罗夫可能会在晚些时候被送回苏联，以换取一名或多名被监禁的苏联持不同政见者。 +



*There is also the question of* the American decision *to expel* (v.)把…开除（或除名） twenty-five Soviet personnel （组织或军队中的）全体人员，职员 *from* their United Nations Mission 使团；代表团；执行任务的地点 here.  +
[.my2]
这还涉及一个问题，即美国决定从他们的联合国特派团中, 驱逐二十五名苏联人员。 +


Several have already left New York /and the deadline for **the expulsion  驱逐；逐出 of the rest** is Wednesday.  +

The Soviets *have threatened to retaliate* (v.)报复；反击；复仇 if the order is not rescinded (v.)废除；取消；撤销.  +

*There is no word* 信息；消息 `主` whether the agreement that freed Daniloff `谓` includes anything on the twenty-five Soviets, which naturally leads to the final question: `主` Has Daniloff's release today `谓` *brought* the United States and the Soviet Union *any closer to a summit meeting*? Secretary Shultz has said that /a summit *could not take place* /without Daniloff *gaining his freedom*.  +

[.my2]
释放丹尼洛夫的协议, 是否提到了25名苏联人, 还不得而知，这自然引出了最后一个问题：
丹尼洛夫今日的释放, 会不会让美苏首脑会议更近一步？
国务卿舒尔茨说，如果丹尼洛夫未能获释，峰会绝无可能。 +


*That has now been removed* as an impediment 妨碍；阻碍；障碍 to a summit, but the Soviets `谓` have called *the Zakharov case* and the matter of the twenty-five Soviet diplomats  宾补 *obstacles (n.)障碍；阻碍；绊脚石 to a summit* as well.  +

[.my2]
这一障碍现在已经被移除，但苏联称, 扎哈罗夫案和25名苏联外交官的问题, 也是峰会的障碍。 +

[.my1]
====
.这句话中,  the matter of 后面是不是少了个谓语?
chatGpt:  +
确实在这个句子中，“the matter of” 后面似乎缺少一个谓语。如果加上合适的谓语，句子会更完整。一种可能的修正方式是： +
"but the Soviets have called the Zakharov case and the matter of the twenty-five Soviet diplomats *to be* obstacles to a summit as well."

在这里，加入 "to be" 可以使句子更流畅，表达清晰。修正后的句子意思是: 苏联方面认为扎哈罗夫案和二十五名苏联外交官的问题, 也是峰会的障碍。
====

Until the details *are made public* of the agreement 后定 Shultz and Shevardnadze *worked out*, *it will not be known* /what `主` the prospects 可能性；希望;前景 for a summit `系`  *truly are*.  +

[.my2]
在舒尔茨和谢瓦尔德纳泽达成的协议的细节, 公之于众之前，峰会的前景究竟如何, 还不得而知。 +

[.my1]
====
.Until *the details* are made public (*of* the agreement (Shultz and Shevardnadze *worked out*))

"the details are made public": 这是主句，表达一个动作或状态。在这里，"details" 是主语，"are made" 是谓语动词，表示"被公开"，即"细节被公开"。 +
"of the agreement *Shultz and Shevardnadze worked out*": 这是对 "details" 的限定，说明是哪个协议的细节。"Shultz and Shevardnadze worked out" 是一个定语从句，修饰 "agreement"，表示这个协议是由 Shultz 和 Shevardnadze 共同努力制定的。
