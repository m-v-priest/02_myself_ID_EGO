Lesson12


American reporter Nicholas Daniloff is in Frankfurt, West Germany, on his way home from Moscow after being detained for a month on espionage charges. President Reagan in Kansas City on a campaign swing announced Daniloff's release, denying that any trade had been agreed to in order to win his freedom. Asked by reporters if he blinked in staring down Soviet leader Gorbachev over the Daniloff affair, the President said they blinked. The agreement to release Daniloff came after a three-hour meeting last night in New York between Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. No details of the agreement have been released, and it is not known if Daniloff's freedom is the first step in a trade involving accused Soviet spy Gennadi Zakharov. When he arrived in Frankfurt, Daniloff thanked President Reagan, Secretary of State Shultz, and other US officials for "dotting all the i's and crossing the t's" that permitted him to be in Frankfurt tonight. The House of Representatives is expected to vote soon to override President Reagan's veto of a bill imposing economic sanctions against South Africa. NPR's Cokie Roberts reports that the President has promised to expand economic sanctions on his own in hopes of getting Congress to sustain his veto. "Both houses of Congress passed the economic sanctions against South Africa by wide enough margins to override a presidential veto. And it's expected the House will easily garner the two-thirds vote necessary for override. So it's in the Senate the President is concentrating his efforts. Today President Reagan sent a long letter to majority leader Robert Dole, restating his opposition to 'punitive sanctions that harm the victims of apartheid.' The letter went on to outline an executive order the President plans to
sign which would impose some but not all of the sanctions passed by Congress. For example, there'd be a ban on some new investments in South Africa, but not all and a ban on some imports from South Africa, but not as many as called for by Congress. The President hopes the executive order will win over the fourteen additional senators he needs to sustain his veto. The Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said today that Congress would simply come back next year with tougher sanctions if the veto is sustained. I'm Cokie Roberts at the Capitol." American reporter Nicholas Daniloff was freed today in Moscow. He flew into Frankfurt, West Germany this afternoon and spoke with reporters gathered at the airport. "It's wonderful to be back in the West. I think it's obvious to everybody what has happened over this last month. I was arrested without an arrest warrant. A case was fabricated against me with a narrow political purpose of giving the Soviet Union some political leverage over the case of Gennadi Zakharov in New York. The KGB did not punish me; the KGB punished itself. I cannot tell you anything about any other arrangements. All I know is that I am free in the West, very grateful, delighted to see you." Nicholas Daniloff. When Daniloff left the Soviet Union today he had been detained there for thirty-one days, facing a possible trial on espionage charges. Daniloff left Moscow only hours after Secretary of State Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze met last night in New York in the latest of four negotiating sessions concerning the fate of the American journalist. But so far no details have emerged about the arrangements that brought Daniloff his freedom. NPR's Mike Shuster has more from New York. Reporters in Moscow who had been staking out the American Embassy there first got wind this morning that Daniloff might be released, after he left the Embassy in a car and flashed the "V for Victory" sign. Apparently Daniloff was simply informed that he could leave, and his passport was returned to him. He was then taken to the airport along with his wife, and soon thereafter boarded a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt, West Germany. The official American announcement of his release came from President Reagan mid-day today as he was campaigning in Kansas City, Missouri. "I have something of a news announcement I would like to make, that in case you haven't heard it already, that at twelve o'clock, twelve o'clock Central time, a Lufthansa Airliner, left Moscow bound for Frankfurt West Germany, and on board are Mr. and Mrs. Nicholas Daniloff." So far though neither the White House nor the State Department has said anything about the specific agreements that ended the negotiations on Daniloff. And lacking any fuller explanation from the government, many questions remain. First, what will happen to the Russian scientist Gennadi Zakharov whose arrest last month in New York for spying led to Daniloff's detention? No date has been set for Zakharov's trial in Brooklyn, and a representative of the Justice Department in Brooklyn said today the US attorney there was waiting for instructions on the handling of Zakharov's case. There have been suggestions that Zakharov might be returned to the Soviet Union at
a later date in exchange for one or more jailed Soviet dissidents. There is also the question of the American decision to expel twenty-five Soviet personnel from their United Nations Mission here. Several have already left New York and the deadline for the expulsion of the rest is Wednesday. The Soviets have threatened to retaliate if the order is not rescinded. There is no word whether the agreement that freed Daniloff includes anything on the twenty-five Soviets, which naturally leads to the final question: Has Daniloff's release today brought the United States and the Soviet Union any closer to a summit meeting? Secretaqry Shultz has said that a summit could not take place without Daniloff gaining his freedom. That has now been removed as an impediment to a summit, but the Soviets have called the Zakharov case and the matter of the twenty-five Soviet diplomats obstacles to a summit as well. Until the details are made public of the agreement Shultz and Shevardnadze worked out, it will not be known what the prospects for a summit truly are. This is Mike Shuster in New York. One year ago this month, a powerful earthquake in Mexico City killed more than nine thousand people. Tens of thousands of people lost their jobs because of the massive damage. Among those hardest hit by the quake were women garment workers, who worked in sweatshops concentrated in the heart of Mexico City. One year after the earthquake, Lucie Conger reports that some of the forty thousand seamstresses who lost their jobs are changing their attitudes about work. On the fifth floor of a small office building in the heart of downtown, some thirty garment workers are back at work. Just as before the earthquake they're working on an assembly line. Each woman is specialized in one operation, like sewing cuffs or putting buttonholes on a fancy cocktail dress. But there the similarities with their past work end. The women here on Uruguay Street are running their own cooperative with machines they got from their former employer in a settlement when he closed his factory which was damaged by the earthquake. About fifteen groups of women have former cooperatives, setting up shop with equipment they received instead of an indemnification when factory owners shut down their former places of work. Running their own business has meant big changes for these women. All thirty-five women in this cooperative agree that they prefer working without a boss looking over their shoulder. For Juana Arias, who used to cut patterns for dresses, not having a boss has given her the chance to develop new skills. "Well, sometimes it's my job to solve some problems. I decide when to buy things. For example, when we run out of thread and needles, that's my job to decide on things that are needed." At the same time, since they set up the cooperative five months ago, the women have had the chance to realize that the old system of working for the patron or boss man had its good points. At the cooperative, the women only get paid when they complete a factory order. Last Friday came and went without a pay-check. Their income is low now, because they're assembling dresses instead of earning more by producing ready-made dresses of their own design. There are other concerns as well.
While the seamstresses are grateful for the loans and technical assistance that they're getting from a Catholic church foundation, they worry about repaying the loans and keeping up with operation expenses like rent and phone bills. And leaving behind the tradition of having a boss is a difficult transition for Mexican women who are accustomed from childhood to responding to male authority figures. Paula Socer, a leader at another seamstresses' cooperative. "They don't like us to tell them what to do. Since we are all owners, they think that we each can do what we want." Other garment workers are still working under the patron. But after the earthquake, many of the women began to question their position at work when they saw some factory owners moving more quickly to salvage machinery and cash boxes than to rescue trapped workers. Dramatic events like these moved some four thousand seamstresses to join the September 19th Garment Worker's Union. The women blocked traffic and marched to the presidential palace before getting official recognition as an independent union not forced to affiliate with the ruling party. Through the union, the seamstresses are demanding that factory owners respect the law by giving overtime pay for extra work, allowing workers to take vacation, and providing standard benefits. So far, nine factory owners have signed agreements with the union to guarantee workers' rights. But the union continues to face hurdles. Maria Hernandez worked in an illegal, clandestine sweatshop before the earthquake and is now press chief for the union. "The bosses and the soldout unions are always pressuring the women who work here, threatening them, saying that they're going to close down the business, but that if they continue to organize, one day something is going to happen to their family. And then they start firing people. They offer them money to turn in the ones who are organizing, to tell them who the leaders are." Manuela Purras is a seamstress who was fired in May for organizing the thirty-five women at the factory where she had worked for thirteen years. Today she's operating a small business on the edge of the empty paved lot where the union has its offices in temporary quarters provided by the municipal government. Here, alongside a busy thoroughfare, Manuela spends her days cooking tacos and selling them to passers-by to make a living until she can go back to work. The union is fighting to get Manuela and her co-workers reinstated in their jobs. Manuela Purras: "We've joined the union mostly because we want to see improvements in our working conditions. I think that it will help us. Well, economically it is helping us, and legally too, because at least until now it's not one of those soldout unions." The garment workers still have an uphill battle to fight, to secure a decent living for themselves and their children. In the year since the earthquake, they've made important strides in assuring that they get a fair shake. University students, lawyers and feminists have joined the seamstresses in their fight to set new terms at the work place. The creation of new organizations, like cooperatives and unions, and the forging of new alliances between educated elites and popular groups may be the most lasting legacy wrought from the devastation left by the earthquake.

美国记者尼古拉斯·达尼洛夫因间谍罪被拘留一个月后，正在从莫斯科回国的西德法兰克福途中。里根总统在堪萨斯城竞选期间宣布释放达尼洛夫，并否认曾同意任何交易以赢得他的自由。当记者问他是否因丹尼洛夫事件而瞪视苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫时，总统说他们眨了眨眼。国务卿乔治·舒尔茨和苏联外交部长爱德华·谢瓦尔德纳泽昨晚在纽约举行了三个小时的会议后达成了释放达尼洛夫的协议。该协议的细节尚未公布，也不知道达尼洛夫的自由是否是涉及被指控的苏联间谍根纳季·扎哈罗夫的交易的第一步。抵达法兰克福后，达尼洛夫感谢里根总统、国务卿舒尔茨和其他美国官员的“周密安排”，让他今晚能够来到法兰克福。预计众议院将很快投票推翻里根总统对南非经济制裁法案的否决。美国国家公共广播电台 (NPR) 的科基·罗伯茨 (Cokie Roberts) 报道称，总统已承诺自行扩大经济制裁，希望国会维持他的否决权。 “国会两院以足够大的优势通过了对南非的经济制裁，足以推翻总统的否决。预计众议院将轻松获得推翻总统否决所需的三分之二票数。因此，总统正在参议院集中精力今天，里根总统向多数党领袖罗伯特·多尔发出了一封长信，重申他反对“伤害种族隔离受害者的惩罚性制裁”。这封信接着概述了总统计划签署的一项行政命令，该命令将实施国会通过的部分但不是全部制裁。例如，将禁止在南非进行一些新投资，但不是全部；禁止从南非进口一些产品，但数量不会达到国会要求的那么多。总统希望该行政命令能够赢得他维持否决权所需的另外 14 名参议员的支持。众议院外交事务委员会主席今天表示，如果否决权得以维持，国会明年将采取更严厉的制裁措施。我是国会大厦的科基·罗伯茨。”美国记者尼古拉斯·达尼洛夫今天在莫斯科获释。他今天下午飞往西德法兰克福，与聚集在机场的记者交谈。“回到西方真是太好了。我想每个人都很清楚上个月发生的事情。我在没有逮捕令的情况下被捕。有人捏造了一个针对我的案件，其政治目的是为了让苏联在纽约的根纳季·扎哈罗夫案上获得一些政治影响力。克格勃没有惩罚我；克格勃惩罚了自己。我无法告诉你任何其他安排。我只知道我在西方自由了，非常感激，很高兴见到你。” 尼古拉斯·丹尼洛夫。当丹尼洛夫今天离开苏联时，他已经在那里被拘留了三十一天，可能面临间谍罪的审判。国务卿舒尔茨和苏联外交部长谢瓦尔德纳泽昨晚在纽约会面，这是有关美国记者命运的四次谈判中的最新一次，就在达尼洛夫离开莫斯科几小时后。自由。 NPR 的迈克·舒斯特 (Mike Shuster) 有更多来自纽约的报道。一直在莫斯科监视美国大使馆的记者今天早上首先得到消息称，达尼洛夫可能会被释放，当时他乘车离开大使馆，并亮出“V”代表胜利的标志。显然，达尼洛夫只是被告知他可以离开，并且他的护照也被归还给了他。随后，他与妻子一起被送往机场，不久后登上汉莎航空飞往西德法兰克福的航班。今天中午，美国官方宣布释放他，当时里根总统正在密苏里州堪萨斯城进行竞选活动。 “我想宣布一则新闻，以防万一你还没有听说过，中部时间十二点，一架汉莎航空公司的客机从莫斯科飞往西德法兰克福，船上有尼古拉斯·丹尼洛夫先生和夫人。”但到目前为止，白宫和国务院都没有就结束达尼洛夫谈判的具体协议发表任何言论。由于政府缺乏任何更全面的解释，许多问题仍然存在。首先，俄罗斯科学家根纳季·扎哈罗夫(Gennadi Zakharov)上个月因间谍罪在纽约被捕，导致达尼洛夫被拘留，他会怎样？扎哈罗夫在布鲁克林的审判日期尚未确定，布鲁克林司法部的一名代表今天表示，那里的美国检察官正在等待处理扎哈罗夫案件的指示。有人建议扎哈罗夫可能会在晚些时候返回苏联，以换取一名或多名被监禁的苏联异见人士。还有一个问题是美国决定将 25 名苏联人员驱逐出驻扎在这里的联合国代表团。 一些人已经离开纽约，驱逐其余人的最后期限是周三。苏联威胁称，如果不撤销该命令，将进行报复。目前尚不清楚释放达尼洛夫的协议是否包括有关二十五个苏联人的任何内容，这自然引出了最后一个问题：今天丹尼洛夫的释放是否使美国和苏联更接近峰会？国务卿舒尔茨表示，如果达尼洛夫没有获得自由，峰会就不可能举行。现在，这一问题已被排除为峰会的障碍，但苏联称扎哈罗夫案和二十五名苏联外交官的问题也成为峰会的障碍。在舒尔茨和谢瓦尔德纳泽达成的协议细节公布之前，我们无法得知峰会的真正前景。我是纽约的迈克·舒斯特。一年前的这个月，墨西哥城发生了一场强烈地震，造成九千多人死亡。由于巨大的破坏，数万人失去了工作。受地震影响最严重的是女服装工人，她们在集中在墨西哥城市中心的血汗工厂工作。地震一年后，露西·康格 (Lucie Conger) 报告说，四万名失业女裁缝中的一些人正在改变对工作的态度。在市中心一座小型办公楼的五楼，大约三十名制衣工人重返工作岗位。就像地震前一样，他们正在装配线上工作。每个女人都专门从事一项操作，例如缝制袖口或在精美的鸡尾酒礼服上打扣眼。但与他们过去的工作有相似之处。 乌拉圭街上的妇女们正在经营自己的合作社，使用的机器是她们从前雇主那里得到的机器，当时前雇主关闭了因地震受损的工厂。大约十五组妇女拥有前合作社，用她们收到的设备开设商店，而不是工厂主关闭她们以前的工作场所时获得的赔偿。经营自己的生意对这些女性来说意味着巨大的变化。这个合作社的所有 35 名女性都同意，她们更喜欢在没有老板监视的情况下工作。对于过去为服装裁剪图案的胡安娜·阿里亚斯来说，没有老板给了她发展新技能的机会。 “嗯，有时候解决一些问题是我的工作。我决定什么时候买东西。例如，当我们用完线和针时，我的工作就是决定需要什么。”与此同时，自从五个月前成立合作社以来，妇女们有机会认识到为赞助人或老板工作的旧制度有其优点。在合作社，妇女们只有在完成工厂订单后才能获得报酬。上周五来了又去，没有收到工资。他们现在的收入很低，因为他们正在组装衣服，而不是通过生产自己设计的现成衣服来赚取更多收入。还有其他问题。虽然女裁缝们很感激天主教会基金会提供的贷款和技术援助，但她们担心偿还贷款和支付租金和电话费等运营费用。对于从小就习惯于回应男性权威人物的墨西哥女性来说，抛弃有老板的传统是一个艰难的转变。 保拉·索瑟（Paula Socer）是另一家裁缝合作社的领导。 “他们不喜欢我们告诉他们该做什么。由于我们都是所有者，他们认为我们每个人都可以做我们想做的事。”其他服装工人仍在赞助人的指导下工作。但地震发生后，当许多妇女看到一些工厂主抢救机器和钱箱的速度比营救被困工人的速度更快时，许多妇女开始质疑自己的工作地位。诸如此类的戏剧性事件促使大约 4000 名裁缝加入了 9 月 19 日服装工人工会。这些妇女堵塞交通并游行到总统府，然后获得官方承认为独立工会，不被迫隶属于执政党。女裁缝们通过工会要求工厂主遵守法律，给予加班费、允许工人休假并提供标准福利。到目前为止，已有九家工厂主与工会签署了保障工人权利的协议。但工会仍然面临障碍。玛丽亚·埃尔南德斯在地震前曾在一家非法的秘密血汗工厂工作，现在是工会的新闻负责人。 “老板和精疲力尽的工会总是向在这里工作的女性施压，威胁她们，说她们要关闭企业，但如果她们继续组织起来，有一天她们的家人就会出事。然后他们开始解雇人员。他们给钱让他们交出那些正在组织的人，告诉他们谁是领导人。”曼努埃拉·普拉斯 (Manuela Purras) 是一名裁缝，她在 5 月份被解雇，原因是她在工厂工作了 13 年，负责组织 35 名妇女。 如今，她在空地边缘经营一家小企业，工会在市政府提供的临时宿舍内设有办公室。在这里，在一条繁忙的大道旁，曼努埃拉每天都在煮玉米饼并将其卖给路人以维持生计，直到她可以回去工作。工会正在努力让曼努埃拉和她的同事恢复工作。 Manuela Purras：“我们加入工会主要是因为我们希望看到工作条件的改善。我认为这会对我们有所帮助。嗯，在经济上它正在帮助我们，在法律上也是如此，因为至少到目前为止它还不是一个那些精疲力竭的工会。”为了让自己和孩子过上体面的生活，制衣工人仍然面临着一场艰苦的战斗。地震发生后的一年里，他们在确保获得公平待遇方面取得了重要进展。大学生、律师和女权主义者加入了女裁缝的行列，为工作场所制定新的条款而奋斗。合作社和工会等新组织的创建，以及受过教育的精英和大众群体之间建立新的联盟，可能是地震造成的破坏所留下的最持久的遗产。我是国家公共广播电台的露西·康格 (Lucie Conger)，来自墨西哥城。
