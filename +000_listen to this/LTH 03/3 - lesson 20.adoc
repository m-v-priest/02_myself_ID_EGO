The Pentagon today called on the highly publicized withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan a sham.  +

Moscow announced earlier this month that it would complete the withdrawal of 6,000 men from Afghanistan by the end of October.  +

NPR's Allen Burlow has the story.  +

"The head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lieutenant General Leonard Perutz said the Pentagon has developed clear and convincing evidence that the Soviet troop withdrawals are a deception.  +

Perutz said the Soviets deliberately inserted additional tank and rifle regiments into Afghanistan for no reason other than to withdraw them.  +

'What the Soviets have done is to remove some unneeded units and to substitute others, so that the number of military useful troops in Afghanistan is basically unchanged.' Perutz said half of the Soviet units withdrawn were for air defense.  +

Since the Afghani Mujahidin rebels have no air force, Perutz said, the Soviet withdrawals have no military significance.  +

Perutz said the withdrawals were designed to enhance General Secretary Gorbachev's image at home and abroad.  +

He said about 116,000 Soviet troops remain in Afghanistan.  +

Workers in other industries also participated in the symbolic action.  +

Nigel Rench reports from Johannesburg.  +

"More than a quarter of a million black
miners were on strike to protest their colleagues' deaths, about half the country's total of 600,000 gold and coal miners, costing the mining industry an estimated $4,000,000.  +

The stay-away was total at the Kinross gold mine where last month's disaster occurred.  +

Black miners stayed inside their barrack-like hostels.  +

Reporters were barred from the mine.  +

In central Johannesburg, a protest meeting was held by the Black National Union of Mineworkers which called the strike action.  +

A union spokesman said miners had gathered not to mourn, but to commit themselves to liberation from apartheid and economic exploitation.  +

White church leader, Bayers Nordea, told the crowd, 'The accident at Kinross need never have occurred, and the one hundred and seventy-seven men need not have died.' For National Public Radio, this is Nigel Rench in Johannesburg." The King of Saudi Arabia has removed Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani as Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister.  +

Yamani had held the job for twenty-four years.  +

Although it's been rumored for a few years that Yamani was out of favor with the King, his firing shocked the oil market.  +

Yamani's replacement, Hicham Niza, is Saudi Arabia's Planning Minister.  +

NPR's Barbara Mantell has details.  +

"Oil traders here in New York on the mercantile exchange said they had no idea that Yamani was about to be fired, but they took it as a sign that world oil prices would start to rise.  +

Yamani had been leading OPEC in a price war over the past ten months.  +

Saudi Arabia, the largest producer in the cartel, had raised its production and created an oil glut.  +

That lowered the price of oil by 50%.  +

Analysts say Saudi Arabia's King Fahd's supposedly had enough of the price war and of Yamani.  +

King Fahd has said that he would like to see the price of oil rise to about $18 a barrel.  +

And at noon today, New York time, when Saudi Arabia's new Oil Minister called for an emergency OPEC meeting, traders at the mercantile exchange frantically bid up oil prices.  +

They were betting that King Fahd and his new Minister were going to try to set a new policy of higher prices in motion.  +

I'm Barbara Mantell in New York." Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani is generally regarded as the mastermind behind the Arab oil strategy of the 1970s.  +

The man who introduced the word "petro-dollars" into our vocabulary, and who helped bring about one of the most dramatic shifts of international economic and political power in this century.  +

NPR's Elizabeth Coulton has a report: Yamani was appointed to the post of Saudi Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources in 1962, and it was then he began leading the campaign to wrest control of Arab oil resources from foreign-owned companies.  +

He was only thirty-two years old when he took over his country's oil ministry.  +

But he was then among the few Saudis to have had higher western education, including, in his case, legal training at Harvard.  +

Although Yamani was only a commoner in the Kingdom, some members of the royal family had begun to recognize the contribution such a technocrat could make to the Saudi government.  +

Then crown prince Faisal, later the King, championed young
Yamani and gave him a clear mandate to do whatever necessary to keep his country's oil benefits home in Saudi Arabia.  +

A natural diplomat, Yamani quickly became the unproclaimed leader of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries as well as the global cartel, OPEC.  +

In November and December of 1973, Sheik Yamani toured western capitals to explain OPEC's radical policies, including why oil prices were going to go up by 70%.  +

His announcement shocked the world and his name became an international household word.  +

In London, one journalist wrote at the time that Sheik Yamani of Saudi Arabia was the most formidable eastern emissary to arrive in Europe since the Tartars swept into Russia or the Muslim hordes reached the walls of Vienna in the Middle Ages.  +

In 1975, Yamani was the target when terrorists seized OPEC headquarters in Vienna and took the ministers hostage for several days.  +

Ever since, then, Yamani surrounded himself with tough British bodyguards, and he kept his movements secret.  +

Whenever he was seen abroad, he appeared as a superstar with his entourage.  +

At home, in the royal kingdom however, his position was somewhat different.  +

He remained a commoner and, consequently, always an outsider, useful to the monarchy only as a technocrat who could manage Saudi wealth for the true owners, the royal family.  +

Sometimes, at OPEC meetings, he would have to fly back home to consult with the King before proceeding with negotiations.  +

At such times, ministers from revolutionary member states, like Iran, would criticize Yamani for being only a lackey with no power to make decisions on his own.  +

At the same time, many observers believe that Yamani's ouster yesterday was caused by King Fahd's irritation with Yamani's power base outside the kingdom.  +

OPEC specialist, Yousef Ibrahim of the Wall Street Journal , say Yamani got caught between demands.  +

Yamani is also said to be an extremely sensitive and religious man.  +

He has been concerned that peoples of the world should try to understand each other.  +

For example, in a conversation once with this reporter, Sheik Yamani said he believed all world leaders, like himself, should have at least an introductory course in social anthropology in order to be tolerant of other cultures.  +

The cosmopolitan Sheik Yamani will be remembered as not only a wizard of oil economics, but perhaps more as a leading diplomat who brought the Arab world into the fore again, and changed the course of late twentieth century history.  +

This week in the United States, the Senate voted to reject the $200,000,000 in additional aid to the Philippines.  +

That money was approved by the House after President Corazon Aquion delivered an emotional address to a joint session of Congress during her visit a few weeks ago.  +

In that speech, Aquion thanked those law-makers who, she said, had balanced US strategic interests against human concerns and turned US policy against Ferdinand Marcos.  +

However, the conflict between strategic US defense interests and the everyday human needs of Filipinos remains at the heart of US-Philippine relations.  +

It was a major issue in the Senate debate over increased economic aid when concerns were
raised about the Philippines' commitment to retaining two major US military bases.  +

Nowhere is this conflict more tangible but in Philippine base towns themselves.  +

NPR's Allen Burlow has a report: The frightening roar and fearful symmetry of an F-4 Phantom Fighter plane racing down the runway of Subic Bay Naval Station, are quickly lost in wonder as the 23-ton Phantom arches gracefully into the blue morning sky and disappears among the clouds of the South China Sea.  +

The exact nature of today's mission is unknown.  +

Perhaps it is a routine exercise, or training hours for a young pilot on one of the more than 200 daily flights from Subic Bay.  +

It is impossible to say what thoughts occupy this pilot's mind, whether they pertain to the endless briefings on the strategic importance of Subic Bay, to the threat of communism, to the issues of nuclear war, or to the theoretical battles of superpower strategists who have him racing through the heavens away from the city of Olongapo.  +

Olongapo, located about 50 miles northwest of Manila, is the city just outside the Sublic Bay Naval Station.  +

Olongapo is where the Filipinos live and where the Americans come to play.  +

In a way, Olongapo is a microcosm of the tensions in US-Philippine relations.  +

Before the Subic Bay installation was built, Olongapo was little more than a fishing village.  +

Today, the local economy benefits from tens of millions of dollars spent there annually.  +

At the same time, the extraordinary and pervasive influence of Sbic Bay on the economy and culture of Olongapo and the Philippines as a whole has led many Filipinos to question whether the base should be allowed to stay.  +

On any given day, there are 10,000 Americans at Subic Bay.  +

They deal with the big issues like nuclear war and communism.  +

But Philippine President Corazon Aquino must deal with more mundane matters, like the economic crisis her country faces in places like Olongapo and places like Pergasa.  +

Pergasa is the barrel where the city of Olongapo dumps its garbage.  +

It is also home for the city's most destitute.  +

While Pergasa is separated from the Subic Bay Naval Station by only a few yards, a moat of raw sewage, and a fence of barbed wire, the concerns of its residents could not be more distant.  +

Verhilio Fransi has lived here almost 10 years.  +

He, his wife, and 8 children, occupy a one-room scrapwood shack.  +

They live off the dump, collecting bottles and plastic cartons.  +

"In one day, we get almost forty-five, fifty pesos, in one day." "And who does the work, you or all your children?" "All of us." "All of you together.  +

You make forty-five pesos." "All of us in one day." "And do you also find food here or not?" "We got ...  +

we found food, but it's canned foods." "Can you eat that food?" "Sometimes, but when it tastes no good, we throw it." Fransi says some days his children go hungry.  +

The earnings he mentioned for his family of ten come to about $2 a day.  +

In the local dialect, Pergasa means hope.  +

Last
year, Verhilio Fransi found a solid gold bracelet in the dump.  +

He sold it for about $10.  +

In Pergasa, you breathe the unmistakable acrid smoke of smouldering garbage coughed up by fires that never go out.  +

In Pergasa, there are thick clouds of flies, millions of flies humming their monotonous song of decay as they swarm about the mountains of garbage rising ten, fifteen, thirty feet into the air.  +

Catolino Trancy, his wife and nine children live off the dump.  +

Near the entrance to their mud-floor shack, there is a pan with eight pigs and an oil drum filled above its rim with blood-stained bones.  +

I asked Mr.  +

Trancy why he collected these.  +

"There is a ...  +

that skulls and bones." "And how much money do you get for skulls and bones?" "About seventy-five centavos a kilo." There is a dumpster in front of Trancy's house that says "Donated to Olongapo city by the US navy".  +

Another sign bears one of the slogans of a former mayor.  +

It reads, "It's forbidden to be lazy in this city." Some two hundred families live here in Pergasa.  +

Chickens and dogs and rats can be seen running about.  +

A little girl walks through the flattened cans and the bottle caps, dragging a plastic bag on a string or a sort of kite.  +

She falls into the broken glass and ashes and doesn't cry.  +

In the Pergasa, the houses are of wood, tin and cardboard boxes that say things like "This side up" or "Fragile".  +

There's a house with a faded green "Merry Christmas" sign, another that says "God bless you".  +

There is irony here for journalists, but there is no electricity or basic services.  +

The US navy is in Olongapo because it is one of the best naturally protected harbors in the world.  +

It is there because the Pentagon thinks Subic Bay is essential to protecting US security interests in Asia, the Pacific and the Indian Ocean.  +

But whether the US will be allowed to remain in Olongapo will eventually be decided by Filipinos.  +

In a national referendum promised by President Aquino, they will be asking what kind of friend the US had been, if the bases serve Philippines' security interests as well as very real human needs of their country, if the income from the base offsets the damage done to the structure of Philippine society and to Philippine sovereignty.  +

As this debate heats up, the United States faces a difficult task in convincing people that its concerns extend beyond global issues of security down to the very real everyday problems faced by ordinary Filipinos.  +

五角大楼今天呼吁大肆宣传的苏联军队从阿富汗撤军是一场骗局。莫斯科本月早些时候宣布，将在10月底之前完成从阿富汗撤出6000人的任务。 NPR 的艾伦·伯洛 (Allen Burlow) 讲述了这个故事。 “国防情报局局长伦纳德·佩鲁茨中将表示，五角大楼已经掌握了明确且令人信服的证据，证明苏联撤军是一种欺骗。佩鲁茨表示，苏联故意向阿富汗派遣更多坦克和步枪团，没有任何理由，只是为了“苏联所做的就是撤掉一些不需要的部队，并用其他的替代，这样阿富汗的军事有用部队数量就基本没有变化。”佩鲁茨表示，苏联撤军一半用于防空。由于阿富汗圣战者组织没有空军，因此苏联撤军没有军事意义。佩鲁茨表示，撤军是为了提升戈尔巴乔夫总书记在国内外的形象。 ……他说大约有 116,000 名苏联士兵留在阿富汗。我是华盛顿的艾伦·伯洛。”南非黑人矿工举行了为期一天的罢工，悼念上个月在金罗斯金矿火灾中丧生的 177 名同事。其他行业的工人也参加了这一象征性行动。奈杰尔·雷奇从约翰内斯堡报道。 “超过 25 万黑人矿工举行罢工，抗议同事的死亡，约占全国 60 万名金矿和煤矿工人的一半，采矿业损失估计达 400 万美元。Kinross 黄金矿场全部缺席。上个月发生灾难的矿井。 黑人矿工住在营房般的宿舍里。记者被禁止进入矿井。在约翰内斯堡市中心，全国黑人矿工联盟举行抗议会议，号召罢工行动。一位工会发言人表示，矿工们聚集在一起并不是为了哀悼，而是为了致力于摆脱种族隔离和经济剥削。白人教会领袖拜尔斯·诺迪亚 (Bayers Nordea) 告诉人群，“金罗斯的事故本来就不会发生，一百七十七人也不一定会死。”国家公共广播电台，我是约翰内斯堡的奈杰尔·伦奇。”沙特阿拉伯国王已解除谢赫·艾哈迈德·扎基·亚马尼的沙特阿拉伯石油部长职务。亚马尼已担任该职位二十四年。尽管几年来一直有传言说，亚马尼失去了国王的青睐，他的解雇震惊了石油市场。亚马尼的继任者希查姆·尼扎是沙特阿拉伯的计划部长。NPR 的芭芭拉·曼特尔有详细信息。“纽约商业交易所的石油交易员表示，他们不知道亚马尼即将被解雇，但他们认为这是世界石油价格将开始上涨的迹象。过去十个月，亚马尼在价格战中一直领先欧佩克。该卡特尔中最大的生产国沙特阿拉伯提高了产量并造成了石油过剩。这使得石油价格下降了 50%。分析人士称，沙特阿拉伯法赫德国王应该已经受够了价格战和亚马尼。法赫德国王曾表示，他希望看到油价升至每桶 18 美元左右。纽约时间今天中午，当沙特阿拉伯新任石油部长呼吁召开欧佩克紧急会议时，商品交易所的交易员疯狂抬高油价。 他们押注法赫德国王和他的新部长将尝试制定一项提高价格的新政策。我是纽约的芭芭拉·曼特尔。” 谢赫·艾哈迈德·扎基·亚马尼 (Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani) 通常被认为是 20 世纪 70 年代阿拉伯石油战略的幕后策划者。他将“石油美元”一词引入了我们的词汇，并帮助实现了石油美元。美国国家公共广播电台 (NPR) 的伊丽莎白·库尔顿 (Elizabeth Coulton) 有一篇报道称，亚马尼于 1962 年被任命为沙特石油和矿产资源部部长，并从那时起开始领导夺取石油和矿产资源的运动。他从外资公司手中控制了阿拉伯石油资源。他接手国家石油部时只有 32 岁。但他是当时少数受过西方高等教育的沙特人之一，在他的例子中，他还包括法律教育尽管亚马尼在沙特只是一个平民，但一些王室成员已经开始认识到这样一个技术官僚可以为沙特政府做出的贡献。当时的王储费萨尔，后来的国王，非常支持年轻的亚马尼，并给予了他很多帮助。明确授权他采取一切必要措施将其国家的石油利益留在沙特阿拉伯。作为一名天生的外交官，亚马尼很快成为阿拉伯石油输出国组织以及全球卡特尔 OPEC 的秘密领导人。 1973 年 11 月和 12 月，谢赫·亚马尼 (Sheik Yamani) 访问西方国家首都，解释 OPEC 的激进政策，包括为什么油价将上涨 70%。他的宣布震惊了世界，他的名字也成为国际家喻户晓的词。 在伦敦，一名记者当时写道，自中世纪鞑靼人入侵俄罗斯或穆斯林游牧部落攻入维也纳城墙以来，沙特阿拉伯的谢赫·亚马尼是到达欧洲的最强大的东方使者。 1975年，恐怖分子占领了维也纳欧佩克总部，并将部长们扣为人质几天，亚马尼成为目标。从那时起，亚马尼就被强硬的英国保镖包围着，他对自己的行踪保密。每当他在国外露面时，他都会以超级巨星的姿态与随行人员一起出现。但在国内，在王国，他的地位却有些不同。他仍然是一个平民，因此始终是一个局外人，只有作为一个技术官僚才能对君主制有用，他可以为真正的所有者王室管理沙特的财富。有时，在欧佩克会议上，他必须飞回国内与国王协商，然后再进行谈判。在这种时候，伊朗等革命成员国的部长们就会批评亚马尼只是一个没有权力自己做决定的走狗。与此同时，许多观察家认为，亚马尼昨天被罢黜是因为法赫德国王对亚马尼在王国之外的权力基础感到恼火。欧佩克专家、《华尔街日报》的优素福·易卜拉欣表示，亚马尼陷入了各种要求之间。据说亚马尼也是一位极其敏感和虔诚的人。他一直担心世界各国人民应该努力相互理解。例如，谢赫·亚马尼在接受本报记者采访时表示，他认为所有世界领导人都像他自己一样，至少应该学习社会人类学入门课程，以便能够包容其他文化。 国际化大都会谢赫·亚马尼不仅会被人们铭记为一位石油经济奇才，或许更会被视为一位杰出的外交家，他再次将阿拉伯世界推向前台，并改变了二十世纪后期的历史进程。我是华盛顿的伊丽莎白·库尔顿。本周，美国参议院投票否决了向菲律宾提供的 2 亿美元额外援助。几周前，总统科拉松·阿奎翁访问期间，在国会联席会议上发表了激动人心的讲话后，这笔资金获得了众议院的批准。在那次演讲中，阿奎昂感谢那些立法者，她说，他们平衡了美国的战略利益和人类关切，并将美国的政策转向了费迪南德·马科斯。然而，美国的战略国防利益与菲律宾人的日常需求之间的冲突仍然是美菲关系的核心。当人们对菲律宾保留美国两个主要军事基地的承诺表示担忧时，这是参议院关于增加经济援助辩论的一个主要问题。除了菲律宾的基地城镇本身之外，这种冲突在任何地方都最为明显。 NPR 的艾伦·伯洛 (Allen Burlow) 发表了一篇报道：一架 F-4 幻影战斗机在苏比克湾海军基地跑道上飞驰，其令人恐惧的轰鸣声和可怕的对称性很快就被人们所惊叹，因为这架 23 吨重的幻影战斗机在清晨的蓝色天空中优雅地拱起，消失在南海的云层之中。今天任务的确切性质尚不清楚。也许这是一次例行演习，或者是一名年轻飞行员在每天从苏比克湾起飞的 200 多个航班中的一个的训练时间。 不可能说清楚这位飞行员脑子里在想什么，无论是关于苏比克湾战略重要性的无休止的简报、共产主义的威胁、核战争问题，还是超级大国战略家的理论斗争。他飞驰而过，远离奥隆阿波市。奥隆阿波位于马尼拉西北约 50 英里处，是苏布利克湾海军基地外的城市。奥隆阿波是菲律宾人居住的地方，也是美国人来玩耍的地方。某种程度上，奥隆阿波事件是美菲关系紧张的一个缩影。在苏比克湾设施建成之前，奥隆阿波只不过是一个渔村。如今，当地经济每年受益于数千万美元的支出。与此同时，Sbic湾对奥隆阿波乃至整个菲律宾的经济和文化产生了非凡而普遍的影响，这让许多菲律宾人质疑是否应该允许该基地留下来。每一天，苏比克湾都有一万名美国人。他们处理核战争和共产主义等重大问题。但菲律宾总统科拉松·阿基诺必须处理更平凡的事务，比如菲律宾在奥隆阿波和佩尔加萨等地面临的经济危机。 Pergasa 是奥隆阿波市倾倒垃圾的桶。它也是该市最贫困人口的家园。虽然佩尔加萨与苏比克湾海军基地仅相隔几码，有一条未处理污水的护城河和铁丝网围栏，但居民的担忧却离我们再远不过了。 Verhilio Fransi 在这里住了近 10 年。他、他的妻子和 8 个孩子住在一间只有一间房间的废木棚屋里。他们靠垃圾场为生，收集瓶子和塑料纸盒。 “一天之内，我们几乎赚了四十五、五十比索。” “谁来做这项工作，你还是你所有的孩子？” “我们所有人。” “你们大家一起。你们赚了四十五比索。” “我们所有人都在一天之内。” “那你还在这里找到食物吗？” “我们……我们找到了食物，但它是罐头食品。” “那个食物你能吃吗？” “有时，但当味道不好时，我们就会把它扔掉。”弗兰西说，有时他的孩子们会挨饿。他提到他一家十口人的收入约为每天 2 美元。在当地方言中，Pergasa 的意思是希望。去年，Verhilio Fransi 在垃圾场发现了一条纯金手镯。他以大约 10 美元的价格出售了它。在佩尔加萨，你会呼吸到由永不熄灭的大火所产生的阴燃垃圾所带来的明显辛辣烟雾。在佩尔加萨，有厚厚的苍蝇云，数以百万计的苍蝇在高十、十五、三十英尺高的垃圾山上蜂拥而至，嗡嗡着单调的腐烂之歌。卡托利诺·特兰西、他的妻子和九个孩子住在垃圾场附近。在他们泥地小屋的入口附近，有一个平底锅，里面有八头猪，还有一个油桶，桶沿上装满了血迹斑斑的骨头。我问特兰西先生为什么收集这些。 “有一个……有头骨和骨头。” “头骨和骨头能卖多少钱？” “一公斤大约七十五分。”特兰西家门前有一个垃圾箱，上面写着“美国海军捐赠给奥隆阿波市”。另一个标牌上写着一位前市长的口号。上面写着：“这座城市禁止偷懒。”大约有 200 个家庭居住在佩尔加萨。可以看到鸡、狗和老鼠到处乱跑。一个小女孩拖着一个挂在绳子上的塑料袋或一种风筝，走过压扁的罐头和瓶盖。 她掉进碎玻璃和灰烬里，但没有哭。在佩尔加萨，房子是用木头、锡和纸板箱建造的，上面写着“此面朝上”或“易碎”等字样。有一座房子挂着褪了色的绿色“圣诞快乐”牌子，另一座房子上写着“上帝保佑你”。对于记者来说，这里很讽刺，但这里没有电力或基本服务。美国海军驻扎在奥隆阿波，因为它是世界上自然保护最好的港口之一。之所以在那里，是因为五角大楼认为苏比克湾对于保护美国在亚洲、太平洋和印度洋的安全利益至关重要。但美国是否被允许留在奥隆阿波最终将由菲律宾人决定。在阿基诺总统承诺的全民公投中，他们将询问美国曾经是一个什么样的朋友，这些基地是否服务于菲律宾的安全利益以及该国真正的人类需求，该基地的收入是否抵消了损害这对菲律宾社会结构和菲律宾主权造成了影响。随着这场辩论的升温，美国面临着一项艰巨的任务，即让人们相信，它的担忧不仅限于全球安全问题，还涉及普通菲律宾人面临的非常现实的日常问题。我是艾伦·伯洛报道。
