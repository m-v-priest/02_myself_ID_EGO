Lesson4


Another American has been kidnapped in West Beirut. Fifty-three-year-old Frank Reed was abducted by four gunmen this morning. Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility, accusing Reed of being a spy. The pro-Iranian group already holds at least three other Americans and three Frenchmen. Reed is the Director of the Lebanese International School. He is a native of Malden, Massachusetts and has lived in Lebanon for eight years. A federal jury in Brooklyn, New York today indicted a Soviet UN employee on charges of spying. Gennadi Zakharov is being held without bond, Pending trial on the charges. John Kailish has more from New York. "The thirty-nine-year-old Soviet physicist worked at the UN Center for Science and Technology until August 23rd when he was arrested on a Queens Subway platform for allegedly buying military secrets from a college student. It turned out that the student worked for the FBI and was known by the code name 'Berg.' According to today's indictment, Zakharov agreed to pay Berg for information involving the national defense of the United States. Berg, in turn, agreed to work for the Soviet Union for a period of ten years. The two met a total of four times, from April 1983 to August of 1986. At their final meeting, Zakharov allegedly gave Berg a thousand dollars. Zakharov is currently being held in a federal jail in Manhattan. He faces life in prison if convicted on the espionage charges."
The foreign editor of a news magazine recently banned in Chile has been found shot dead near a cemetery in Santiago. The family of Jose Carrasco says he was taken from his home by armed men who claimed to be police. Carrasco's magazine, Analisis , has been banned under the new state of siege imposed in Chile after an attempt this weekend to assassinate President Augusto Pinochet. Since the attempt, police have been rounding up opposition leaders although they deny they arrested Carrasco. In Chile, the military government held a rally today in support of President Augusto Pinochet, who escaped an assassination attempt two days ago. A crackdown on opponents of his government continued in response to that attack. A journalist for an opposition magazine was found dead. His family and colleagues charge he had been kidnapped yesterday by police. Tim Fosca reports now from Santiago. Several thousand people gathered in front of La Moneda, the presidential palace, for a rally in support General Augusto Pinochet this afternoon. Heavily armed soldiers were stationed along major downtown streets for the demonstration, which is celebrating the thirteenth anniversary this week of the military takeover. Hundreds of members of women's charity groups passed in review before General Pinochet and his wife Lucia. The head of state appeared physically unaffected by his close call Sunday when he narrowly escaped assassination. Hours before the rally, Jose Carrasco, a thirty-eight-year-old editor at the opposition magazine Analisis was found dead in a Santiago cemetery. He had been shot ten times. Carrasco's wife said he was roused from bed early Monday morning by men claiming to be police. But authorities officially denied his arrest. Carrasco, a member of MIR, the revolutionary left movement, had been back in Chile only two years after eight years in exile. The bodies of at least two more murdered victims were also found today, but their identities have not yet been established. Arrests continued in the second day of the state of siege. More leftist political figures were rounded up, bringing the total number of detentions to twenty. The government has issued arrest orders for a number others, some of whom are in hiding. On the list is at least one member of the Chilean Human Rights Commission. A spokesman said the homes of Commission members in the provincial city of San Fernando were also raided, but no members were at home. All opposition magazines were ordered closed yesterday, including the Christian democratic weekly, Hoy . Under the last state of siege in 1984 and 85, Hoy was allowed to continue publishing. The situation of five foreign priests and one local lay worker detained yesterday remains unresolved. The clergymen were accused of attacking police officers and carrying instructions on how to make home-made bombs. General Pinochet warned yesterday that human rights advocates would have to be expelled. For National Public Radio, this is Tim Fosca in Santiago. Fifty years ago, Henry Ford and his son Edsel, placed a modest amount of their vast
wealth into a charitable foundation. That was the common practice then and is now for wealthy Americans. The once modest foundation has grown into the largest general purpose charitable organization in the world. The Ford Foundation has given away more than six billion dollars. Its money has touched every aspect of American life, touched the arts, science and even public radio. Warren Kozak has this report. A symphony orchestra in the Midwest, an inner-city building project, Africa's chronic food shortages. These varied activities have one thing in common: all have received money from the Ford Foundation. Just off New York's Forty-second Street, in the shadow of the United Nations, a modern building with a huge glass wall serves as the world headquarters of the Ford Foundation. Besides giving away money, the Foundation has always attracted some of the country's best minds. "Well, I should tell you that I do not join any organization, including Ford Foundation, unless it can satisfy two criteria." Former Secretary of Defense, World Bank President, and Ford Board member, Robert McNamara. "One, I insist that it be an organization I feel some capability of contributing to. And, secondly, I insist it be an organization that can contribute to me, that can stimulate my interest, enlarge my understanding of the world. I should say that it has been, I think the most interesting association of my life." At the Foundation's headquarters, a staff of more than three hundred people studies data from all over the world, spots trends and writes recommendations. In the large board room, the directors argue the merits of individual requests and eventually decide who will get what part of the one hundred and twenty-five million dollars that goes out every year. If you think giving away that kind of money is easy, you're wrong. There is no question that today's Ford Foundation with a four and a half billion-dollar endowment is a force of its own. But is wasn't always that way. You see, back in 1936, there were just a few large foundations when Henry and Edsel started their small project. Their original contribution was only twenty-five thousand dollars and its main function was to help local charities in Michigan. Then in 1943, son Edsel died unexpectedly, followed four years later by his father. And the family lawyers had a huge problem on their hands. At the time of their deaths, the Ford Motor Company was not a public corporation. These two men owned most of the stock and, for tax reasons, a great deal of it had to be disposed of and quickly. There was only one logical recipient of the windfall. So, in the late forties, the sleepy Michigan charity became, almost overnight, the largest foundation in the world. The Third World development programs also continue to take a lot of heat from time to time. Millions of dollars have been poured into what seems to be a bottomless pit. Some problems have been solved only to find new ones taking their place. Robert McNamara defends Ford's involvement there. He thinks Foundations offer something that no one else is able to do, because without their research the government's foreign aid would be wasted. "It's insane to put as much money, invest as much money, per year with as inadequate an intellectual foundation of how to maximize the efficiency of those investments. And Africa is a perfect illustration of the problem. Tens of billions of
dollars are being invested in Africa today. They need more. But, despite that investment, the GNP growth per capita in the countries of sub-Saharian Africa has been negative, on average, for a decade. The food production per capita has been negative, per capita, for over a decade. Why? Who knows? Nobody knows. And governments are too large; they're too rigid; they're too inflexible; they're too insensitive, really, unable to move as rapidly, and in some ways, as radically as is necessary to find the answer to that question." This year the Ford Foundation will receive about nine thousand formal requests for money. All of the letters and forms will be looked at; some will be studied more closely; and about twelve hundred lucky projects will receive anywhere from a thousand dollars to several million to help them along the way.

另一名美国人在贝鲁特西部被绑架。五十三岁的弗兰克·里德今天早上被四名枪手绑架。伊斯兰圣战组织声称对此负责，并指控里德是间谍。这个亲伊朗组织已经控制了至少三名美国人和三名法国人。里德是黎巴嫩国际学校的校长。他是马萨诸塞州马尔登人，在黎巴嫩生活了八年。纽约布鲁克林的一个联邦陪审团今天以间谍罪起诉一名苏联联合国雇员。根纳季·扎哈罗夫 (Gennadi Zakharov) 被关押，不得保释，正在等待有关指控的审判。约翰·凯利什 (John Kailish) 有更多来自纽约的信息。这位三十九岁的苏联物理学家在联合国科学技术中心工作，直到8月23日，他因涉嫌从一名大学生那里购买军事机密而在皇后区地铁站被捕。原来，该学生为FBI 的代号为“Berg”。根据今天的起诉书，扎哈罗夫同意向伯格支付涉及美国国防信息的费用，而伯格则同意为苏联工作十年。两人总共会面四次，从1983年4月至1986年8月。据称，在他们最后一次会面时，扎哈罗夫给了伯格一千美元。扎哈罗夫目前被关押在曼哈顿的联邦监狱中。如果因间谍罪被定罪，他将面临终身监禁。最近在智利被禁的一家新闻杂志的外籍编辑被发现在圣地亚哥的一个墓地附近被枪杀。何塞·卡拉斯科的家人称，他被自称是警察的武装人员从家中带走。 卡拉斯科的杂志《Analisis》在智利上周末企图刺杀奥古斯托·皮诺切特总统后实施的新戒严状态下被禁。自这次企图以来，警方一直在围捕反对派领导人，尽管他们否认逮捕了卡拉斯科。在智利，军政府今天举行集会，支持两天前逃脱暗杀企图的总统奥古斯托·皮诺切特。针对那次袭击，针对其政府反对者的镇压仍在继续。一家反对派杂志的一名记者被发现死亡。他的家人和同事指控他昨天被警方绑架。蒂姆·福斯卡现在从圣地亚哥报道。今天下午，数千人聚集在总统府拉莫内达前举行集会，支持奥古斯托·皮诺切特将军。全副武装的士兵驻扎在市中心的主要街道上进行示威，本周庆祝军事接管十三周年。数百名妇女慈善团体的成员通过了皮诺切特将军和他的妻子露西娅的审查。周日，这位国家元首险些被暗杀，但他的身体似乎没有受到这次千钧一发的影响。集会前几个小时，反对派杂志《分析》(Analisis) 38 岁的编辑何塞·卡拉斯科 (Jose Carrasco) 被发现死于圣地亚哥公墓。他被枪杀了十次。卡拉斯科的妻子表示，周一清晨，他被自称是警察的男子从床上叫醒。但当局正式否认逮捕他。卡拉斯科是革命左翼运动“MIR”的成员，在流亡八年之后仅两年就回到了智利。今天还发现了至少两名被谋杀受害者的尸体，但他们的身份尚未确定。 戒严状态的第二天，逮捕行动仍在继续。更多左翼政治人物被围捕，使拘留总数达到二十人。政府已对其他一些人发出逮捕令，其中一些人目前正躲藏起来。名单上至少有一名智利人权委员会成员。一位发言人表示，省城圣费尔南多的委员会成员的住所也遭到搜查，但没有成员在家。昨天，所有反对派杂志都被勒令关闭，其中包括基督教民主周刊《Hoy》。在 1984 年和 85 年的最后一次围困期间，霍伊被允许继续出版。昨天被拘留的五名外籍神父和一名当地平信徒的情况仍未解决。这些神职人员被指控袭击警察并携带如何制造自制炸弹的说明。皮诺切特将军昨天警告说，人权倡导者必须被驱逐。我是圣地亚哥的蒂姆·福斯卡，来自国家公共广播电台。五十年前，亨利·福特和他的儿子埃德塞尔将他们巨额财富中的一小部分捐献给了一个慈善基金会。这是当时的常见做法，现在对于富有的美国人来说也是如此。这个曾经不起眼的基金会现已发展成为世界上最大的通用慈善组织。福特基金会已捐赠超过 60 亿美元。它的资金已经触及美国生活的方方面面，触及艺术、科学甚至公共广播。沃伦·科扎克有这份报告。中西部的交响乐团、市中心的建筑项目、非洲长期的粮食短缺。这些不同的活动有一个共同点：所有活动都收到了福特基金会的资助。 就在纽约四十二街附近，在联合国的阴影下，一座拥有巨大玻璃墙的现代化建筑是福特基金会的全球总部。除了捐赠资金外，该基金会还一直吸引着该国一些最优秀的人才。 “好吧，我应该告诉你，我不会加入任何组织，包括福特基金会，除非它能满足两个标准。”前国防部长、世界银行行长和福特董事会成员罗伯特·麦克纳马拉。 “第一，我坚持这是一个我觉得有能力为之做出贡献的组织。第二，我坚持这是一个能够为我做出贡献的组织，能够激发我的兴趣，扩大我对世界的理解。我应该说我认为这是我一生中最有趣的交往。”在基金会总部，三百多名员工研究来自世界各地的数据、发现趋势并提出建议。在宽敞的董事会会议室中，董事们就个人请求的优点进行争论，并最终决定谁将获得每年支出的 1.25 亿美元中的哪一部分。如果你认为捐出这笔钱很容易，那你就错了。毫无疑问，今天拥有 45 亿美元捐赠资金的福特基金会本身就是一股力量。但情况并非总是如此。你看，早在 1936 年，当亨利和埃德塞尔开始他们的小项目时，只有几个大型基金会。他们最初的捐款只有两万五千美元，主要作用是帮助密歇根当地的慈善机构。 1943 年，儿子埃德塞尔意外去世，四年后，他的父亲也去世了。家庭律师面临着一个巨大的问题。 在他们去世时，福特汽车公司还不是一家上市公司。这两个人拥有大部分股票，由于税收原因，其中很大一部分必须迅速处置。这笔意外之财只有一个合乎逻辑的接受者。因此，在四十年代末，沉睡的密歇根慈善机构几乎一夜之间成为世界上最大的基金会。第三世界的发展计划也不时地继续受到很大的关注。数百万美元被投入到一个看似无底洞的地方。有些问题解决了，却又发现了新的问题。罗伯特·麦克纳马拉为福特的参与辩护。他认为基金会提供了其他人无法做到的事情，因为如果没有他们的研究，政府的对外援助就会被浪费。 “每年投入尽可能多的资金，投资尽可能多的资金，而对于如何最大限度地提高这些投资的效率的知识基础却不充分，这是疯狂的。非洲就是这个问题的完美例证。数百亿美元正在投资今天的非洲。他们需要更多。但是，尽管有这些投资，十年来撒哈拉以南非洲国家的人均国民生产总值平均增长率一直为负。人均粮食产量一直为负，十多年来。为什么？谁知道？没人知道。而且政府太大了；他们太僵化了；他们太不灵活了；他们太麻木不仁了，真的，无法迅速行动，在某些方面，尽可能彻底地找到这个问题的答案。”今年，福特基金会将收到约九千笔正式捐款申请。 所有字母和表格都会被检查；有些将被更仔细地研究；大约 1200 个幸运项目将获得数千美元到数百万美元的资助。我是华盛顿的沃伦·科扎克。
