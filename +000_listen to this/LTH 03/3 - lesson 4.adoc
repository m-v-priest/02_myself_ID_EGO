由于黎巴嫩扼守亚非欧战略要道，所以不少民族都曾经占领过黎巴嫩。1975年4月，黎巴嫩基督教和伊斯兰教两方爆发内战。叙利亚自1976年10月起，在黎巴嫩驻军，並扶植國內的真主黨游擊隊(伊斯兰)；而以色列亦控制過南黎巴嫩一段時期作報復。2006年7月12日，以色列与黎真主党爆发冲突.

.is being held without bond
表示Gennadi Zakharov被拘留而没有获得保释。在美国的司法系统中，如果被告被判定有可能逃跑、危害社会或可能逃避审判，法庭可能会决定不给予保释，并让被告在等待审判期间保持监禁状态。 +
**"bond"指的是保释金（bail）。**保释金是法庭要求被告支付的一笔款项，目的是确保被告在等待审判期间履行出庭义务。如果被告支付了保释金，他们将被释放，并在接下来的审判过程中需要履行一些条件，如不离开指定区域、遵守禁止令等。

John Kailish has more from New York.  +

"The thirty-nine-year-old Soviet physicist worked at the UN Center for Science and Technology until August 23rd when he was arrested on a Queens Subway platform for allegedly buying military secrets from a college student.  +

It turned out that the student worked for the FBI and was known by the code name 'Berg.' According to today's indictment, Zakharov agreed to pay Berg for information involving the national defense of the United States.  +

Berg, in turn, agreed to work for the Soviet Union for a period of ten years.  +

The two met a total of four times, from April 1983 to August of 1986.  +

At their final meeting, Zakharov allegedly gave Berg a thousand dollars.  +

Zakharov is currently being held in a federal jail in Manhattan.  +

He faces life in prison if convicted on the espionage charges."
The foreign editor of a news magazine recently banned in Chile has been found shot dead near a cemetery in Santiago.  +

The family of Jose Carrasco says he was taken from his home by armed men who claimed to be police.  +

Carrasco's magazine, Analisis , has been banned under the new state of siege imposed in Chile after an attempt this weekend to assassinate President Augusto Pinochet.  +

Since the attempt, police have been rounding up opposition leaders although they deny they arrested Carrasco.  +

In Chile, the military government held a rally today in support of President Augusto Pinochet, who escaped an assassination attempt two days ago.  +

A crackdown on opponents of his government continued in response to that attack.  +

A journalist for an opposition magazine was found dead.  +

His family and colleagues charge he had been kidnapped yesterday by police.  +

Tim Fosca reports now from Santiago.  +

Several thousand people gathered in front of La Moneda, the presidential palace, for a rally in support General Augusto Pinochet this afternoon.  +

Heavily armed soldiers were stationed along major downtown streets for the demonstration, which is celebrating the thirteenth anniversary this week of the military takeover.  +

Hundreds of members of women's charity groups passed in review before General Pinochet and his wife Lucia.  +

The head of state appeared physically unaffected by his close call Sunday when he narrowly escaped assassination.  +

Hours before the rally, Jose Carrasco, a thirty-eight-year-old editor at the opposition magazine Analisis was found dead in a Santiago cemetery.  +

He had been shot ten times.  +

Carrasco's wife said he was roused from bed early Monday morning by men claiming to be police.  +

But authorities officially denied his arrest.  +

Carrasco, a member of MIR, the revolutionary left movement, had been back in Chile only two years after eight years in exile.  +

The bodies of at least two more murdered victims were also found today, but their identities have not yet been established.  +

Arrests continued in the second day of the state of siege.  +

More leftist political figures were rounded up, bringing the total number of detentions to twenty.  +

The government has issued arrest orders for a number others, some of whom are in hiding.  +

On the list is at least one member of the Chilean Human Rights Commission.  +

A spokesman said the homes of Commission members in the provincial city of San Fernando were also raided, but no members were at home.  +

All opposition magazines were ordered closed yesterday, including the Christian democratic weekly, Hoy .  +

Under the last state of siege in 1984 and 85, Hoy was allowed to continue publishing.  +

The situation of five foreign priests and one local lay worker detained yesterday remains unresolved.  +

The clergymen were accused of attacking police officers and carrying instructions on how to make home-made bombs.  +

General Pinochet warned yesterday that human rights advocates would have to be expelled.  +

For National Public Radio, this is Tim Fosca in Santiago.  +



约翰·凯利什 (John Kailish) 有更多来自纽约的信息。这位三十九岁的苏联物理学家, 在联合国科学技术中心工作，直到8月23日，他因涉嫌从一名大学生那里购买军事机密, 而在皇后区地铁站被捕。原来，该学生为FBI 的代号为“Berg”。根据今天的起诉书，扎哈罗夫同意, 向伯格支付涉及美国国防信息的费用，而伯格则同意为苏联工作十年。两人总共会面四次，从1983年4月, 至1986年8月。据称，在他们最后一次会面时，扎哈罗夫给了伯格一千美元。扎哈罗夫目前被关押在曼哈顿的联邦监狱中。如果因间谍罪被定罪，他将面临终身监禁。

Fifty years ago, Henry Ford and his son Edsel, placed a modest amount of their vast
wealth into a charitable foundation.  +

That was the common practice then and is now for wealthy Americans.  +

The once modest foundation has grown into the largest general purpose charitable organization in the world.  +

The Ford Foundation has given away more than six billion dollars.  +

Its money has touched every aspect of American life, touched the arts, science and even public radio.  +

Warren Kozak has this report.  +

A symphony orchestra in the Midwest, an inner-city building project, Africa's chronic food shortages.  +

These varied activities have one thing in common: all have received money from the Ford Foundation.  +

Just off New York's Forty-second Street, in the shadow of the United Nations, a modern building with a huge glass wall serves as the world headquarters of the Ford Foundation.  +

Besides giving away money, the Foundation has always attracted some of the country's best minds.  +

"Well, I should tell you that I do not join any organization, including Ford Foundation, unless it can satisfy two criteria." Former Secretary of Defense, World Bank President, and Ford Board member, Robert McNamara.  +

"One, I insist that it be an organization I feel some capability of contributing to.  +

And, secondly, I insist it be an organization that can contribute to me, that can stimulate my interest, enlarge my understanding of the world.  +

I should say that it has been, I think the most interesting association of my life." At the Foundation's headquarters, a staff of more than three hundred people studies data from all over the world, spots trends and writes recommendations.  +

In the large board room, the directors argue the merits of individual requests and eventually decide who will get what part of the one hundred and twenty-five million dollars that goes out every year.  +

If you think giving away that kind of money is easy, you're wrong.  +

There is no question that today's Ford Foundation with a four and a half billion-dollar endowment is a force of its own.  +

But is wasn't always that way.  +

You see, back in 1936, there were just a few large foundations when Henry and Edsel started their small project.  +

Their original contribution was only twenty-five thousand dollars and its main function was to help local charities in Michigan.  +

Then in 1943, son Edsel died unexpectedly, followed four years later by his father.  +

And the family lawyers had a huge problem on their hands.  +

At the time of their deaths, the Ford Motor Company was not a public corporation.  +

These two men owned most of the stock and, for tax reasons, a great deal of it had to be disposed of and quickly.  +

There was only one logical recipient of the windfall.  +

So, in the late forties, the sleepy Michigan charity became, almost overnight, the largest foundation in the world.  +

The Third World development programs also continue to take a lot of heat from time to time.  +

Millions of dollars have been poured into what seems to be a bottomless pit.  +

Some problems have been solved only to find new ones taking their place.  +

Robert McNamara defends Ford's involvement there.  +

He thinks Foundations offer something that no one else is able to do, because without their research the government's foreign aid would be wasted.  +

"It's insane to put as much money, invest as much money, per year with as inadequate an intellectual foundation of how to maximize the efficiency of those investments.  +

And Africa is a perfect illustration of the problem.  +

Tens of billions of
dollars are being invested in Africa today.  +

They need more.  +

But, despite that investment, the GNP growth per capita in the countries of sub-Saharian Africa has been negative, on average, for a decade.  +

The food production per capita has been negative, per capita, for over a decade.  +

Why? Who knows? Nobody knows.  +

And governments are too large; they're too rigid; they're too inflexible; they're too insensitive, really, unable to move as rapidly, and in some ways, as radically as is necessary to find the answer to that question." This year the Ford Foundation will receive about nine thousand formal requests for money.  +

All of the letters and forms will be looked at; some will be studied more closely; and about twelve hundred lucky projects will receive anywhere from a thousand dollars to several million to help them along the way.  +

五十年前，亨利·福特, 和他的儿子埃德塞尔, 将他们巨额财富中的一小部分, 捐献给了一个慈善基金会。这是当时的常见做法，现在对于富有的美国人来说也是如此。这个曾经不起眼的基金会, 现已发展成为世界上最大的通用慈善组织。福特基金会已捐赠超过 60 亿美元。它的资金已经触及美国生活的方方面面，触及艺术、科学, 甚至公共广播。沃伦·科扎克有这份报告。中西部的交响乐团、市中心的建筑项目、非洲长期的粮食短缺。这些不同的活动有一个共同点：所有活动都收到了福特基金会的资助。

就在纽约四十二街附近，在联合国的阴影下，一座拥有巨大玻璃墙的现代化建筑, 是福特基金会的全球总部。除了捐赠资金外，该基金会还一直吸引着该国一些最优秀的人才。 “好吧，我应该告诉你，我不会加入任何组织，包括福特基金会，除非它能满足两个标准。”前国防部长、世界银行行长和福特董事会成员, 罗伯特·麦克纳马拉。 “第一，我坚持这是一个我觉得有能力为之做出贡献的组织。第二，我坚持这是一个能够为我做出贡献的组织，能够激发我的兴趣，扩大我对世界的理解。我应该说我认为这是我一生中最有趣的交往。”

在基金会总部，三百多名员工研究来自世界各地的数据、发现趋势并提出建议。在宽敞的董事会会议室中，董事们就个人请求的优点进行争论，并最终决定谁将获得每年支出的 1.25 亿美元中的哪一部分。如果你认为捐出这笔钱很容易，那你就错了。毫无疑问，今天拥有 45 亿美元捐赠资金的福特基金会, 本身就是一股力量。但情况并非总是如此。你看，早在 1936 年，当亨利和埃德塞尔开始他们的小项目时，只有几个大型基金会。他们最初的捐款只有两万五千美元，主要作用是帮助密歇根当地的慈善机构。 1943 年，儿子埃德塞尔意外去世，四年后，他的父亲也去世了。家庭律师面临着一个巨大的问题。 在他们去世时，福特汽车公司还不是一家上市公司。这两个人拥有大部分股票，由于税收原因，其中很大一部分必须迅速处置。这笔意外之财只有一个合乎逻辑的接受者。因此，在四十年代末，沉睡的密歇根慈善机构, 几乎一夜之间成为世界上最大的基金会。

第三世界的发展计划, 也不时地继续受到很大的关注。数百万美元被投入到一个看似无底洞的地方。有些问题解决了，却又发现了新的问题。罗伯特·麦克纳马拉为福特的参与辩护。他认为, 基金会提供了其他人无法做到的事情，因为如果没有他们的研究，政府的对外援助就会被浪费。 “每年投入尽可能多的资金，投资尽可能多的资金，而对于如何最大限度地提高这些投资的效率的知识基础, 却不充分，这是疯狂的。非洲就是这个问题的完美例证。数百亿美元正在投资今天的非洲。他们需要更多。但是，尽管有这些投资，十年来撒哈拉以南非洲国家的人均国民生产总值平均增长率, 一直为负。人均粮食产量一直为负，十多年来。为什么？谁知道？没人知道。而且政府太大了；他们太僵化了；他们太不灵活了；他们太麻木不仁了，真的，无法迅速行动，在某些方面，尽可能彻底地找到这个问题的答案。”

今年，福特基金会将收到约九千笔正式捐款申请。 所有字母和表格都会被检查；有些将被更仔细地研究；大约 1200 个幸运项目将获得数千美元到数百万美元的资助。我是华盛顿的沃伦·科扎克。

== The Difference Between Bail and Bond
保释和保证金之间的区别

https://www.savannahlawyers.com/article/bail-or-bond-is-there-a-difference/


Attorneys often use the word *bail* and *bond* interchangeably 可交换地 so sometimes it can be confusing. Technically, *bail* is the money or property required in the form of a *security deposit* 押金; 交易保证金 and is given to ensure that you will return and appear for your *court date* 开庭日期 if you are released. By paying the bail amount, you are using that act to symbolize (v.)象征；是…的象征；代表 your seriousness in promising to return if you are let out.  If you do not keep that promise, you forfeit (v.)（因犯错）丧失，被没收 the bail.

律师经常互换使用“保释”和“保证金”两个词，因此有时可能会造成混淆。从技术上讲，保释是以保证金形式提供的金钱或财产，目的是确保您在被释放后能够返回并出庭出庭。通过支付保释金，您用这一行为来象征您认真承诺如果您被释放就会返回。如果您不遵守该承诺，您将丧失保释资格。

Sometimes you may not have the financial resources to pay, or you are unable to get the money quickly. This is where a bondsman 保证人 or bonding company *steps in* 干预. They assure the court that they will pay the bail amount on your behalf in exchange for you paying them a fee. This financial pledge 保证；诺言；誓约 from the bonding company is called a *bond*.

有时您可能没有财力支付，或者无法快速拿到钱。这就是担保人或担保公司介入的地方。他们向法庭保证，他们将代表您支付保释金，以换取您向他们支付费用。*担保公司的这种财务承诺称为 bond。*

A *bail bond* is a contract between you and the bonding company. It is called a bail bond to be more specific 明确的；具体的 **as to** 关于，就……而言  what the bond is for.  *In exchange for* paying the bondsman, the bondsman agrees to *post your bail* so you can go home.

保释保证金是您与保证金公司之间的合同。它被称为保释保证金，更具体地说明保证金的用途。作为支付担保人费用的交换条件，担保人同意保释你，这样你就可以回家了。

Bonding companies or bail bondsmen do not do this for free. The cost to you *depends on* the bonding company. Some companies charge 15% of the bail amount while others charge 10%. For example, if your bail is set at $25,000 /then 10% of $25,000 would be $2,500 /and that is what you would need to **come up with** 找到（答案）；拿出（一笔钱等） to pay your bondsman.

担保公司或保释担保人不会免费这样做。您的费用取决于担保公司。有些公司收取保释金的 15%，而另一些公司则收取 10%。例如，如果您的保释金定为 25,000 美元，那么 25,000 美元的 10% 就是 2,500 美元，这就是您需要支付担保人费用的金额。

Some companies require the full amount /while others may allow a *down payment*  （分期付款的）首期付款；预付金；定金 upfront (a.)预付的；预交的 /and the balance  余额 to be *paid off* 还清. If you personally were able to *pay* the full amount of the bail *to* the court, then you will *get* all or some of that money *back* when the case is over.  If you pay a bonding company their fee to post your bail, you will not get that fee back.

有些公司要求全额付款，而另一些公司则可能允许预先支付首付款，然后还清余额。如果您个人能够向法院支付全额保释金，那么当案件结束时，您将获得全部或部分保释金。如果您向担保公司支付保释费，您将无法取回该费用。
