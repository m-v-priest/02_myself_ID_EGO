Dictation 1:

My grandfather lives with us. He is seventy years old and I like talking to him. Every day I go for a walk with him in the park. My grandfather has a dog. The dog's name is Nelson. Nelson is old and he has very short legs and bad eyes. But my grandfather likes him very much.

I have a small black and white television and I can get a good picture. But my brother has got a color television. It is bigger, heavier and more complicated than mine. My brother gets a better picture on his television than I do on mine. So when there is something very good on TV, I usually go and see my brother.
