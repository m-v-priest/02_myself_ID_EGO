thought it was the flu, you see. +
Woman: So what happened then? +
James: Well, I slowly realized that it wasn't me feeling dizzy(a.) and the noises weren't in my head. I heard the people upstairs screaming. The wooden floor started moving up and
down, the doors and windows started rattling(v.) and banging, all the kitchen cupboards were
thrown open and cups and saucers came crashing to the floor, the kitchen clock fell from
the wall ... +

Woman: So why didn't you? +

== Section 3

==== A. Who Needs Friends Like This?


Martin, Robert and Jean are being interviewed on the subject of friendship.


Interviewer: How important are friends to you, Martin? +
Martin: I've never had a lot of friends. I've never regarded them as particularly important.
Perhaps that's because I come from a big family. Two brothers and three sisters. And lots
of cousins. And that's what's really important to me. My family. The different members of
my family. If you really need help, you get it from your family, don't you? Well, at least
that's what I've always found. +

[.my1]
====
- Well, at least that’s what I’ve always found. 至少我一直都是这么认为的。
====



Interviewer: What about you, Jean? +
Jean: To me, friendship ... having friends ... people I know I can really *count on* ... to me
that's the most important thing in life. It's more important even than love. If you love
someone, you can always *fall out of love* again, and that can lead to a lot of hurt feelings,
bitterness, and so on. But a good friend is a friend for life. +
Interviewer: And what exactly do you mean by a friend? +
Jean: Well, I've already said, someone you know you can count on. I suppose what I really mean is ... let's see, how am I going to put this ... it's someone who will help you if you need help, who'll listen to you when you talk about your problems ... someone you can trust. +

-> She put it very tactfully. 她的话说得很巧妙。 +
-> Put simply , we accept their offer or go bankrupt. 简单地说吧，我们要么接受他们的条件，要么破产。
====




Interviewer: What do you mean by a friend, Robert?
Robert: Someone who likes the same things that you do, who you can *argue with* and not lose your temper, even if you don't always agree about things. I mean someone who you don't have to talk to all the time but can be silent with, perhaps. That's important, too. You can just sit together and not say very much sometimes. Just relax. I don't like people who talk all the time. +

Interviewer: Are you very good at *keeping in touch with* your friends if you don't see them regularly?
Robert: No, not always. I've lived in lots of places, and, to be honest, once I move away, I often do drift *out of touch with* my friends. And I'm not a very good letter writer, either. Never have been. But I know that if I saw those friends again, if I ever moved back to the same place, or for some other reason we *got back into* close contact again, I'm sure the
friendship would be just as strong as it was before. +

- drift (v.)无意间发生；无目的地转变；顺其自然地做 +
-> The conversation drifted onto politics. 谈话不知不觉就转到政治方面来了

- And I'm not a very good letter writer, either. Never have been. 我也不太会写信。从来都不是。
====





Jean: Several of my friends have moved away, got married, things like that. One of my friends has had a baby recently, and I’ll admit I don’t see her or hear from her *as much as I used to* .... She lives in another neighborhood and when I phone her, she always seems busy.  +
But that’s an exception. I write a lot of letters to my friends and get a lot of letters from them. I have a friend I went to school with and ten years ago she emigrated to Canada, but she still writes to me every month, and I write to her just as often.

[.my1]
====

answered the door. +

Susan: Oh, Mr. Thompson! Hello ... how are you? +
Mr. Thompson: Fine, thanks, Susan. I've just come to see Bill. How is he? +
Susan: He doesn't look very well. I wanted him to see the doctor. +
Mr. Thompson: I'll go in and see him ... Hello, Bill! +
Bill: Oh ... hello ... hello, Mr. Thompson ... er ... er ... +
Mr. Thompson: I've brought some fruit for you, Bill. +
Bill: Thank you very much, Mr. Thompson. +
Mr. Thompson: Well, ... I had to pass your house anyway. How's your throat? +

the crowd. Mr. Thompson's smile disappeared and he looked very angry. Bill Walker's
face, in close-up(n.), was there on the screen. He didn't look ill, and he didn't sound ill. He was smiling happily and cheering wildly!
