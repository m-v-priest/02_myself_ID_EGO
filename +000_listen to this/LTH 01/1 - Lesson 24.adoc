==== E. Mr. Pollard and the Solicitor.


People think that all solicitors are rich and prosperous(a.). In any town there are, of
course, rich and prosperous solicitors, but there are also solicitors like me. I am neither
rich nor prosperous.

I have an office over a fish and chip shop, for which I pay an
exorbitant rent, and two rather inefficient secretaries. +
I suppose it is because my premises(n.) are in the less fashionable part of the town, but
my clients always seem to have enormous problems and miserable incomes.

Mr. Pollard
was exactly that sort of client. He was a small, untidy little man, with a large head and
round, old-fashioned spectacles. +
"I have a problem," he began nervously, "I bought this house, you see. I got a
mortgage from the building society, but then I lost my job, so I got behind with the
payments." He gave me the details. It appeared that he owed eleven payments of fifty
pounds, and had no job and no money. Not surprisingly the building society had written to
say they intended to take possession of the house; sell it, and thus get back their money. +

[.my2]
我从房屋互助协会拿到了一笔抵押贷款，但后来我丢了工作，所以就拖欠了贷款。”他告诉了我细节。看来他欠了十一次还款，一共五十英镑，他既没有工作，也没有钱。毫不奇怪，房屋互助协会写信说，他们打算占有这所房子;卖掉它，然后拿回他们的钱。

"What would happen if they sold it for less than I paid?" he asked. "Would I get back
any money?" +
"Probably not," I replied. +
"Would you mind telephoning the building society?" he pleaded, "and see if they
could possibly give me a little more time?" +
"If you're not earning any money, how will more time help?" I asked. He looked at me
hopelessly. +
In the end the house was sold. The building society debt was paid off and Mr. Pollard
got sixty pounds.

[.my2]
“如果他们以低于我支付的价格出售，会发生什么?” +
最后房子卖了。他欠房屋互助协会的债务还清了，波拉德先生得到了60英镑。

==== F. Monologue.


Everybody agrees I’m just ordinary. My face is ordinary, my voice is ordinary, my clothes are ordinary. Everything about me is ordinary. 'What’s Frank like?' they say. 'Frank? Oh — you know, ordinary.' they say.


[.my1]
====
- ordinary  普通的；平常的；一般的；平凡的 /平庸的；平淡无奇的
====


Now look at that man two rows in front. He’s not ordinary. In fact I can’t see anybody apart from me who is. Even this fellow next to me. Quite ordinary on the whole, I suppose. But there’s something a bit ... something a bit odd about his mouth. Mustn’t catch his eye. Might start a conversation. Don’t want that. Interesting that he was just in front of me in the queue.

They looked in his bag, they looked in his pockets —made him take his shoes off even.

[.my2]
现在看看前面两排的那个人。他不平凡。事实上，除了我之外，我看不到任何人。即使是我旁边的这个家伙。我想，总体来说相当普通。但有些事有点...。他的嘴巴有点奇怪。千万不要引起他的注意。可能会引发一场对话。我不想这样。有趣的是，他在排队的时候正好排在我的前面。 +
他们翻了翻他的包，翻了翻他的口袋--甚至让他把鞋子都脱了。

- tray  盘；托盘；碟
- press （被）压，挤，推，施加压力

Mm —they’ve nearly finished with the food —though she didn’t take my glass when she collected my tray. Ah —she’s pressed her button again.

Probably wants another gin and tonic. Had four already. Or is it five? Not bad, though. At least not in this light.


Good —some of them are getting their blankets down now. I reckon that in about half an hour it’ll all be quiet.

And then ... Of course they looked in my briefcase too. Didn’t look here, though, did they? Oh, no. Hah! Though they think otherwise, I know very well who those two in the back row are. Noticed them when I went to the toilet. But they won’t shoot. Not as long as I have this in my hand, they won’t.

[.my2]
嗯--他们快要吃完了--尽管她拿我托盘的时候没有拿我的杯子。啊-她又按下按钮了。 +
可能要再来一杯杜松子酒和奎宁水。已经喝了四杯了。或者是五个？不过，还不错。至少在这种情况下不会。 +
很好，他们中的一些人现在正在把毯子拿下来。我估计大约半小时后一切就会安静下来。 +
然后是…。当然，他们也看了我的公文包。不过，他们没有看这里，是吗？哦，不。哈哈！虽然他们不这么想，但我很清楚坐在后排的那两个人是谁。我上厕所的时候注意到了。但他们不会开枪。只要我手里还拿着这个他们就不会。

[.my1]
====
- as/so long as :  only if 只要
====

And it’s so small. Marvellous what they can do these days. Just about now, if I were sitting in funny mouth’s seat and not by the aisle —just about now, I could probably look down and see the mountains gleaming in the moonlight. I like that. Mm. Well, now I must go over my speech again. Mustn’t forget what my demands are, must I?

[.my2]
而且它太小了。这些天他们能做的事真是令人惊叹。就在现在，如果我坐在滑稽嘴巴的座位上，而不是靠过道的位置-就在现在，我可能会向下看，看到群山在月光下闪闪发光。我喜欢那样。嗯。好了，现在我必须把我的演讲稿再复习一遍。别忘了我的要求是什么，对吗？

[.my1]
====
- mar·vel·lous 极好的；非凡的

== Section 3

==== Dictation.

Well, I think that this problem of teenagers getting into trouble with the law is mainly
caused by unemployment. You see, because of the high level of unemployment, so many
teenagers nowadays leave school and find that they have no chance of getting a job, and
this obviously makes them feel bored and frustrated(a.). And as a result of this, they're much
more likely to get drunk and so on. Another thing of course is that you get groups of
unemployed teenagers wandering around the streets with nothing to do, which can easily
lead to trouble of one sort or another.



[.my1]

- frus·trated (a.)~ (at/with sth): feeling annoyed and impatient because you cannot do or achieve what you want 懊丧；懊恼；沮丧 /失意的；不得志的 /性欲没有得到满足的
