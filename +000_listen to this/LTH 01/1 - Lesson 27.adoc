==== A. Changes.

...Well, you know there have been a lot of changes over the last few years. In fact, since 1978 the population has increased to about a quarter of a million. Unemployment is much better than in some cities. Now it's about five and a half per cent. Yes, but in 1978 it was only about three per cent. It's not bad, as I said.

But there have been changes at the airport since we found oil. Since 1978 the number of aeroplane passengers has increased from 980,000 to 1,400,000.  +
And over these last few years, from 1978 until now, the number of helicopter passengers has also increased enormously. It was 220,000 in 1978, but since then it's increased to 600,000.

==== B. Bus Conductor Wins Fortune on Pools.

This time last week Roy Woods, a bus conductor from Streatham, in South London, was worried about money. He owed twenty pounds to his landlady in rent. Today he is rich, for last Saturday he won 120,000 pounds on the football pools. Last night he was interviewed on television by reporter Stan Edwards.

Edwards: Well, Mr. Woods, what are you going to do now? Are you going to give up your
job on the buses? +
Woods: Yes, I'm going to finish at the end of the week. +
Edwards: And what other plans have you got? +

going to have driving lessons!

you have to put a film cartridge in the compartment. Close it carefully. After that you have
to push the lever until you see number 1 in the counter window. And then all you have to
do is this look through the viewfinder and press the button. It's very easy. +

==== E. Monologue.

Yes, I agree. Lovely breakfast. Very nice. Excellent coffee, especially, don't you think? Anyway, as I was telling you, it happens to me every time I go to a new place: I always *end up* paying twice or three times as much as I should for the first ride.

But last night was the worst ever. The train got in at about eleven, so I felt lucky to get one —though it looked a bit old and battered(a.).

But he was so polite —and you don't get much of that these days: 'Let me take your bags,' he says. 'No trouble,' he says. 'It's a hot, sticky night,' he says, 'but don't worry, madam, it's air-conditioned,' —and it was, surprisingly — 'just relax and I'll get you there in no time.'

So we went for miles down this road and that road and he pointed out all sorts of buildings and other sights that he said I'd appreciate when I could see them properly in the morning.

And he told me that though this was one of the few cities in the world where a woman could go [at that time of night] [on her own] and nothing to fear, even so, it was a good thing I'd taken a registered vehicle, because you never knew, did you?

Though I couldn't see any special *registration number* of anything, and I didn't think to make a note of his *licence plate* —and it wouldn't have made any difference, I don't suppose.

So here I am. And as you can see, if you look out of the window, that's the station! Just across the road! Anyway. Well, it's a lovely hotel, isn't it? Are you on holiday too?

是的,我同意。可爱的早餐。很好。尤其是咖啡，你不觉得吗?不管怎样，就像我告诉你的那样，每次我去一个新地方都会遇到这种情况:我总是要为第一次旅行付两到三倍的钱。但昨晚是最糟糕的一晚。火车大约在11点进站，所以我觉得很幸运能坐到一辆——尽管它看起来有点旧又破旧。

但他很有礼貌，他说，让我帮你拿包，这在如今已经不常见了。他说:“不麻烦。”“今天晚上又热又粘，”他说，“但别担心，夫人，有空调。”——令人惊讶的是，确实有空调——“放松点，我很快就会把你送到那儿的。”所以我们沿着这条路和那条路走了好几英里，他指给我看了各种各样的建筑和其他景点，他说，如果我能在早上好好看看，我会很感激的。和他告诉我,尽管这是世界上为数不多的城市,一个女人可能会在那个时候晚上自己和无所畏惧,即便如此,这是一件好事我注册的车辆,因为你永远不知道,你呢?虽然我看不出任何特殊的车牌号码，我也没想记下他的车牌——我想这也不会有什么区别。所以我来了。正如你所看到的，如果你往窗外看，那就是车站!就在马路对面!无论如何。这家酒店很不错，不是吗?你也在度假吗?

== Section 3

==== Dictation.

My problem is with my mother, who is now well(adv.) over seventy and a widow and becoming very fragile, and she really needs my help. But where she lives, in the country, there's no work available for me —I'm a designer —and she can't come and live with me because she says she doesn't like the climate because it's too bad for her rheumatism, which is actually true —it's very cold here. And if I go and work there *as* something else where she lives, perhaps *as* a secretary, it means we have to take drastic drop in salary. So I don't really know what to do.

[.my1]
====
- well :(adv.) to a great extent or degree 很；相当；大大地；远远地 +
-> He was driving at well(adv.) over the speed limit. 他当时开车的速度远远超过了限制。 +

-> He's over sixty. 他六十多岁了。

- rheuma·tism : /ˈruːmətɪzəm/ [ U ] a disease that makes the muscles and joints painful, stiff and swollen 风湿（病） +
=> 古人认为人体内含有大量体液，在希腊语中将其称为rheum，来自动词rhein（流动）(想想 river 河流)。古人认为风湿病是因为太多体液流入关节，导致关节内韧带被拉 伸，所以古希腊人将风湿病称为rheumatismos，字面意思就是“rheum造成的毛病”。该词经由拉丁语后进入英语，拼写演变为 rheumatism。 +
=> 风湿病是一组侵犯关节、骨骼、肌肉、血管及有关软组织或结缔组织为主的疾病，其中多数为自身免疫性疾病。发病多较隐蔽而缓慢，病程较长，且大多具有遗传倾向。

- And if I go and work there *as* something else where she lives, perhaps *as* a secretary, it means we have to take drastic drop in salary. 如果我去她住的地方做别的工作，比如做秘书，那就意味着我们的薪水会大幅下降。
