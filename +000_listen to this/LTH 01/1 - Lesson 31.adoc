== Section 2

==== A. Probability.

—No luck then, John? +
—Afraid not, sir. Not yet, anyhow. We're still checking on stolen cars. +
—Mm. +
—Where do you think he'll *head for*, sir? +
—Well, he definitely won't try to leave the country yet. He may try to get a passport, and
he'll certainly need clothes and money. He'll probably *get in touch with* Cornfield for those,
so I expect he'll *make for* Birmingham. +
—Right. I'll put some men on the house. +

—What about his wife? +
—Mm. I shouldn't think he'll go anywhere near her —though he might get her to join him
after he's left the country. And when he does leave, he probably won't use a major airport,
either. So you'd better alert the coastguard, and keep an eye on the private airfields. +

—Right, sir. I'd better get his description circulated. +
—Yes. He may change his appearance, of course, but I don't expect he'll be able to do much about the tattoos ... And John —be careful. He could be armed. And if I know Hammond, he certainly won't *give himself up* without a fight.

==== B. Job Hunting.

A lot of young people today find it difficult to get a job, especially in the first few months after they leave school. This is *much more* of a problem now *than* it has ever been in the past. In some parts of the country/ `主` sixty or even seventy per cent of young people in the last years of school `谓` will be without a job for a whole year after leaving school.

====
- job hunting 求职找工作
====


Our Jobs Information Service has been *in touch with* thousands of young people over the last two or three years, talking to them about their hopes and their fears, and we have in fact been able to give a lot of help and advice to young people who have just left school.

Are you recently out of school and still without a job? Or are you still at school and worried about getting a job when you leave? We have found that many people don't know who to talk to and sometimes don't know what questions to ask. That is why our experience at Jobs Information Service is so important. It will cost you nothing —just a phone call. If you would like to talk to us —and we are here to talk to you —then please phone 24987 any day between 9:00 and 5:30.

Man: I want to do something tonight for a change, let's go out. +

Woman: Yes, that sounds a better idea. The outdoor movies are so uncomfortable. +

Woman: Oh nothing, it's just that we've seen them all half a dozen times. +
Brian: But that's why they're classics. They're worth seeing again and again. +
Man: You've got a point there, Brian. My main objection to outdoor movies is that you can never hear properly. You hear all the traffic from outside. +
Brian: Well, we can find a foreign film with subtitles, then you don't need to hear the sound. +
Woman: Supposing it's a musical. +

That was an expensive evening out. +
Man: Well, we won't go and see a horror film, darling, and take-away meals don't melt.

== Section 3

==== A. A Little Crime.


`主` A psychiatrist who has studied the legend of Bonnie and Clyde `谓` compares the
characters of the two. +
Interviewer: So in your book why do you focus *more* on Bonnie *than* you have on Clyde? +
Shivel: Bonnie had something which Clyde completely lacked. Style. And she was also far
more intelligent than he was. Without her, there never would have a legend. He was just a
rather stupid hoodlum who got into difficult situations almost by accident and then started
shooting wildly. She was a much warmer, more generous person. +

====
- psychiatrist 精神病学家；精神科医生
- 一位研究过 Bonnie and Clyde 传说的精神病医生, 对这两个人物进行了比较。

====


Interviewer: But she could be very ruthless(a.), couldn't she? I mean what about that
policeman she shot in Grapevine, Texas? Didn't she laugh about it? +
Shivel: Well, first of all, we don't know if that's what actually happened. A farmer says he
saw her shoot the second policeman and then laugh. That's the only evidence we have
that she actually did that. But even if the story is true, the whole incident illustrates(v.) *this
warmer, almost motherly(a.), side* to her character. +

====
- ruthless (a.)残酷无情的；残忍的
- That's the only evidence we have
that she actually did that. 这是我们掌握的唯一证据证明她真的这么做了。 +
- motherly (a.)慈母般的；母亲的
但即使这个故事是真的，整个事件也显示出了她性格中更温暖、更像母亲的一面。
====


Interviewer: Motherly? How does the incident of shooting a policeman illustrate that she
was motherly? +
Shivel: Well ... uh ... just let me finish. You see, the day before the shooting, Bonnie and
Clyde were driving about with a pet rabbit in the car. Bonnie's pet rabbit. Clyde started
complaining because the rabbit stank(v.). So they stopped and washed the rabbit in a stream.
The rabbit almost died because of the shock of the very cold water. Bonnie got very
worried, and wrapped the rabbit in a blanket and held it close to her as they drove on.
Then, the next morning, when the rabbit still wasn't any better, she made Clyde stop and
build a fire. She was sitting in front of that fire, trying to get the rabbit warm when the two
policemen drove up and got out. Probably the policemen had no idea who was there.


====
- about  在…到处；在…各处 /在…四处 +
-> We wandered about the town for an hour or so. 我们在城里到处游逛了一个小时左右

- stink (v.)有臭味；有难闻的气味 /to seem very bad, unpleasant or dishonest 让人觉得很糟糕；令人厌恶；似乎有不正当行为 +
=> stink的同源词是stench（臭气），这就很像drink（喝）和drench（浸湿）同源一样。 它音似单词sting（刺），臭味是一种刺激性的气味。 +
-> It stinks(v.) of smoke in here. 这儿有股烟味。 +
-> The whole business stank of corruption. 这件事从头到尾都有腐败嫌疑。  +
-> ‘What do you think of the idea?’ ‘*I think it stinks* .’ “你觉得这个主意怎么样？”“我觉得是个馊主意。”

- stream 小河；溪
- 那只兔子差点被冰冷的水吓死。邦妮非常担心，用毯子把兔子裹了起来，紧紧地抱在怀里，继续赶路。
- drove up  开车赶到
====


They just wanted to see who was burning a fire and why. A moment later, as we know,
they were both dead. All because of that pet rabbit which Bonnie wanted to mother(v.).
And ...uh ... perhaps ... in a strange way, Clyde was something like a pet rabbit, too. She
was attracted to him /because he was weaker than she was /and needed someone to mother him. It’s strange, you know, but strong, intelligent women are often attracted to such men ... weaker than they are ... men who are like children, or pet rabbits.

====
- mother (v.)to care for sb/sth because you are their mother, or as if you were their mother 给以母亲的关爱；像母亲般地照顾
-
