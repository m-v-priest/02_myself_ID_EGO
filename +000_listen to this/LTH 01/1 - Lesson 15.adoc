==== D. Why can't I do what I like?


I hope I never grow old! My grandfather lives with us and he's making my life a misery.

When I was small he was kind and cheerful. But now he's always complaining and
criticising. I mustn't interrupt when he's talking. It's rude.

He doesn't like my clothes. 'Nice girls don't dress like that.' I shouldn't wear make-up. 'Natural beauty is best.'

-> She never wears make-up . 她从来不化妆。

Sometimes he interferes(v.) with my homework. 'When I was young we used to do maths differently,' he says. Honestly, he's so old he doesn't know anything. But that doesn't stop him criticising me.

He doesn't like my friends or my favorite records. 'You're making too much noise,' he calls. 'I can't get to sleep.'

When he's not complaining he's asking questions. 'Where are you going? Where have you been? Why aren't you helping your mother?' He thinks I'm six, not sixteen.

Anyway, why can't I do what I like? It's my life, not his.
