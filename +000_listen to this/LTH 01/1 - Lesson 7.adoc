==== B. Monologue.

John Haslam is talking about his garden.

You know, I don't really like the country. It's too quiet. There's not enough movement,
not enough action, not enough to do. But I'm like most other people: I need some peace
and quiet sometimes, and this little garden is my peace and quiet. It's big enough for me.

During the summer I may spend three or four hours out here. But even in the winter I may
come out here for an hour or two at the weekends, if the weather's good. It's a good place to sit with my typewriter. And it's a good place to sit with a book and a drink. And do you know something? I spend *as much* time out of the house now *as* I did when I lived in the country. Funny, isn't it?
