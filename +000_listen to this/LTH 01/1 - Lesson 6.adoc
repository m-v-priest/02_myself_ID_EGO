== Section 3

==== Dictation.

Dictation 1:

I am not going out with George again. Last week he invited me to go to a football
match. I do not like football, so *it was silly 愚蠢的；不明事理的；没头脑的；傻的 of me* to say yes. We did not have seats, so we
had to stand for two hours in the rain. I was cold and wet and I could not see a thing. So I
asked George to take me home. He got very angry and said some very unpleasant things.

Dictation 2:

Last week *the sun shone*(v.) (shine 的过去式) 发光；反光；照耀 and it got quite hot. I decided to put on my light grey
summer trousers. But I got a shock. I could not put them on. They were too small. It is possible that they got smaller during the winter, but I do not think so. I am afraid I got bigger. So I am going to eat less and I am going to take more exercise. I am definitely going to lose some weight.
