Eddie: Can you remember when you were most frightened? +
Tom: That isn't difficult. +
Eddie: What happened? +
Tom: Well, we used to have a favorite (a.)特别受喜爱的 picnic 野餐 place beside a lake. We had a boat there. I was there with some friends and I decided to swim to a little island. It didn't look far and I
started swimming ... but half way across I realised it was a lot further than I thought. I was getting very tired. I shouted. Luckily my friends heard me and brought （bring的过去分词） the boat. I thought I
was going to drown (v.)（使）淹死，溺死. I've never been more frightened in my life

==== B. Forum.

Should school children take part-time jobs?
This is a discussion which will appear in a magazine.

Editor: This month our panel 专家咨询组；（广播、电视上的）讨论小组 looks at part-time jobs. Are they good for school children or
not?





Headmaster: Definitely not. The children have got two full-time jobs already: growing up
and going to school. Part-time jobs make them so tired they *fall asleep* 入睡, 睡着了 in class.




Mrs. Barnes: I agree. I know school hours are short, but there's homework as well. And
children need a lot of sleep.

Mr. Barnes: Young children perhaps, but some boys stay at school until they're eighteen
or nineteen. A part-time job can't harm them. In fact, it's good for them. They earn their
pocket-money instead of asking their parents for it. And they see something of the world
outside school.

Businessman: You're absolutely right. Boys learn a lot from a part-time job. And we
mustn't forget that some families need the extra money. If the pupils didn't take part-time
jobs they couldn't stay at school.

Editor: Well, we seem to be equally divided: two for 支持；拥护, and two against. What do our readers
think?
