==== A. Preferences.

Woman: Which do you prefer: driving a car yourself or being a passenger?
Man: Well —that depends. I enjoy driving, especially on long empty roads where I can go
nice and fast. But I'm not very fond of sitting in traffic jams waiting for lights to change, and
things like that. I suppose I don't mind being a passenger, but only if I'm sure that the other
person really can drive properly.
Woman: So you don't really like being in other people's cars, then?
Man: Well, as I say, it's all right with a good driver. Then I can relax, sit back and enjoy the
scenery. But yes, you're right —on the whole I certainly *prefer* driving *to* being a
passenger.

==== C. Old Arthur.



Everyone knows him as Old Arthur. He lives in a little hut in the middle of a small
wood, about a mile from the village. He visits the village store twice a week to buy food
and paraffin, and occasionally he collects letters and his pension from the post office. A few weeks ago, a reporter from the local newspaper interviewed him. This is what he said:

I get up every morning with the birds. There is a stream near my hut and I fetch water
from there. It's good, clear, fresh water, better than you get in the city. Occasionally, in the
winter, I have to break the ice. I cook simple food on my old paraffin stove, mostly stews(n.)
and things like that. Sometimes I go to the pub and have a drink, but I don't see many
people. I don't feel lonely. I know this wood very well, you see. I know all the little birds and
animals that live here and they know me. I don't have much money, but I don't need much.
I think I'm a lucky man.

==== D. The Man Who Missed the Plane.

James was invited to go to New York to help with the production. He lived in Dulwich,
which is an hour's journey away from Heathrow. The flight was due to leave at 8:30 am, so
he had to be at the airport about 7:30 in the morning. He ordered a mini-cab for 6:30, set
his alarm for 5:45, and went to sleep. Unfortunately he forgot to wind the clock, and it stopped shortly after midnight. Also the driver of the mini-cab had to work very late that night and overslept(v.).

James woke with that awful feeling that something was wrong. He looked at his alarm
