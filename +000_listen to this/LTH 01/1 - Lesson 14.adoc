- There isn’t much food, but it will *do* for the three of us. 食物不多，但够我们三个人吃的。 +

A famous 85-year-old millionaire once gave a lecture （通常指大学里的）讲座，讲课，演讲 at an American university. "I'm going to tell you how to live a long, healthy life and how to get very rich at the same time," he announced. "The secret is very simple. All you have to do is avoid bad habits like drinking and smoking. But you have to get up early every morning, work at least 10 hours a day and save every penny, as well," he said.

A young man in the audience stood up. "My father did all those things and yet he died a very poor man at the age of only 39. How do you explain that?" he asked.

The millionaire thought for a moment. "It's very simple. He didn't do them for long enough," he answered.
