==== B. Dreams.

Three people are describing their dreams. +

(1.) I knew that the brakes 刹车；制动器；车闸 of my car needed repairing, but I did nothing about it, until one
night I dreamt I was driving my car along a familiar road. Suddenly I had to brake because
I was driving towards a wall. However, when I put my foot on the brake nothing happened
and I crashed into the wall. +


[.my1]
====
.the brakes of my car *needed repairing*
*当 need, want, require, worth(adj.)后面接doing, 也可以表示被动，相当于to be done。* +
- Your hair wants cutting. 你的头发该理了。  +
- The floor requires washing. 地板需要冲洗。  +
- The book is worth reading. 这本书值得一读。
====


(2.) I was walking down an unfamiliar road when I reached a dark and miserable 使难受的；使不舒服的；令人不快的 house.
Grey clouds covered the sky, and so I went inside the house where I found a poor,
pathetic 可怜的；可悲的；令人怜惜的;无力的；不成功的 person, wearing clothes similar to those my wife wore. I didn't recognize her and
felt sorry for her. There was nothing else in the dream but when I woke the next morning, I
felt the misery(n.)痛苦；悲惨 and unhappiness of it all day. +

[.my1]
====
.pathetic

to feel sympathy for someone because they are in a difficult or unpleasant situation +
- I feel sorry for the guys who have to work dou

====

(3.) One day I was sitting in my office, listening to a group of colleagues 同事；同僚；同人 whispering (v.)悄声说出; 悄声说 and talking about me. I couldn’t hear what they were saying but it worried me.  +
That night I dreamt exactly the same sequence again, except that in my dream I saw something I’d missed during the day. While they were whispering/ they were all looking down at something.  +
The next morning when I woke up I realized exactly why they’d been whispering and talking about me. That day was my birthday. *Wasn’t it possible that* 难道不是...吗 they’d been looking down at a birthday card? My dream was right. I did get a card from my colleagues, whom I’d suspected of talking about me.

==== C. Faults.

Woman: The trouble with education in Britain, I think, lies with the teachers. I don't think
teachers get nearly enough training *in* actually how to teach *rather than* the subject.  +

[.my2]
我认为教师在如何教学方面，而不是在学科方面，没有得到足够的培训。

I think
they're too serious, too academic; they're not imaginative enough. And that means that
there's not enough excitement in the classroom for children to get interested(a.)  in the
subject. +

Man: Yes, I agree. I think there's too much theoretical 理论上的 teaching given and not enough
*practical education* 实践教育;实习教育, with the result that pupils are far *#too#* busy studying for exams *#to#* have
time to learn about life itself and how to, how to live in the world. +

Woman: Mm. I think all teachers should be at least twenty-five before they start teaching. I
think they should be forced to live in the outside world, rather than go from the classroom
to the university and back to the classroom again.

[.my2]
嗯，我认为所有的老师都应该在至少25岁后才开始教书。我认为他们应该被迫在外面的社会上生活一段时间，而不是从教室到大学，之后再直接回到教室教书。

==== D. A Japanese Girl.

I had *a working 有工作的；有职业的 mother* 在职母亲 when I was a young girl. She went back to work when I was ten and my brother was fourteen. She taught at a school of dress design.

I studied English at university. Then I got a job with an advertising agency as an assistant. I studied English so I could get a good job with a good company.

In 1980 I went abroad with a friend. We spent a month in California. Then I worked for a company which sold *cassette 磁带盒；盒式磁带 tapes* 盒式磁带, 录影带 and books for English conversation.

I was still single at twenty-five, then my parents started to worry because their daughter wasn’t married. Our neighbors and relations were asking when I would marry and they began to talk about an *arranged marriage* 包办婚姻. In Japan they don’t force you to marry someone, but they may give you a chance to meet someone.

I am very interested in jazz and I met my husband in a Jazz club. My parents didn’t want their daughter to marry a foreigner. They didn’t want me to come to England, but now I work in London for a Japanese newspaper. +

== Section 3

==== A. The Appointment.

Once upon a time, there was a rich Caliph 哈里发（尤为旧时伊斯兰国家统治者的称号） in Baghdad. He was very famous because
he was wise and kind. One morning he sent his servant, Abdul, to the market to buy some
fruit. As Abdul was walking through the market, he suddenly felt very cold. He knew that
somebody was behind him. He *turned round* 转过身来, 掉头 and saw a tall man, dressed in black. He
couldn't see the man's face, only his eyes. The man was staring(v.)凝视；盯着看 at him, and Abdul began
to shiver(v.)颤抖，哆嗦（因寒冷、恐惧、激动等）. +





"Who are you? What do you want?" Abdul asked.
The man in black didn't reply. +
"What's your name?" Abdul asked nervously. +
"I ... am ... Death," the stranger replied coldly and turned away. +

[.my2]
陌生人冷冷地回答，转身走开了。

Abdul dropped his basket and ran *all the way* back to the Caliph's house. He rushed
into the Caliph's room. +
"Excuse me, master. I have to leave Baghdad immediately," Abdul said. +
"But why? What's happened?" the Caliph asked. +
"I've just met Death in the market," Abdul replied. +
"Are you certain?" said the Caliph. +
"Yes, I'm certain. He was dressed in black, and he stared at me. I'm going to my
father's house in Samarra. If I go at once, I'll be there before sunset."





The Caliph could see that Abdul was terrified and gave him permission to go to
Samarra. +
The Caliph was puzzled. He was fond of Abdul and he was angry because Abdul had
been badly frightened by the stranger in the market. He decided to go to the market and
investigate. When he found the man in black, he spoke to him angrily. +
"Why did you frighten my servant?" +
"Who is your servant?" the stranger replied. +
"His name is Abdul," answered the Caliph. +
"I didn't want to frighten him. I was just surprised to see him in Baghdad." +
"Why were you surprised?" the Caliph asked. +
"I was surprised because I've got an appointment 约会；预约；约定 with him ... tonight ... in Samarra!"

==== B. Legal Advice 法律咨询, 法律意见.



Dennis: You've been seeing Steve again, haven't you? +
Cynthia: What are you talking about? +
Dennis: You know as well as I do. One of my friends saw you together in a restaurant
yesterday evening. +
Cynthia: Listen, Dennis. Look, I'm sorry. I was going to tell you. I really was. +
Dennis: Well, why didn't you? Why did you ... Why did you lie to me? +
Cynthia: But I didn't lie! How can you say that? +
Dennis: Yes, you did! You told me that your relationship with him was all over. +
Cynthia: But it is, darling! It ended more than a year ago. +

Dennis: Did it? Then why did you go out with him yesterday? +
Cynthia: Because he phoned me and said he had some business to discuss with me.
What's wrong with that! +
Dennis: Nothing. But if that's true, why did you tell me you were going to have dinner with
your mother yesterday evening? +
Cynthia: Because ... because I thought you'd be terribly jealous(a.)吃醋的；妒忌的 if I told you I was going to
see Steve. And you are. +
Dennis: I'm not. I simply can't understand why you lied to me. +
Cynthia: I've already told you. But you just won't believe me. +



Dennis: That all you did was discuss business together? Of course, I can't believe that! +
Cynthia: Well, that's exactly what we did! And it isn't true that I lied to you about my mother.
When I told you that, I intended to see her. But then Steve rang and said he needed my
advice about something. +
Dennis: About what? +
Cynthia: A legal matter. +

Dennis: A legal matter? Why should he ask your advice about a legal matter? You aren't a lawyer. +
Cynthia: No, but you are! And that's what he wanted to talk to me about. Somebody *recommended (v.)推荐；举荐；介绍 to* him. But before he contacted you, he wanted to know if I thought you'd be willing to help him. I said I didn't know. +
Dennis: Help your ... ex-boyfriend? Give him legal advice? I'm not going to do that. +
Cynthia: That's what I thought you'd say. I knew it.
