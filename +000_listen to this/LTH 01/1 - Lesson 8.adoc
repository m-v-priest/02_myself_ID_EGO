== Section 3

Dictation.

Dictation 1: +
I have a watch. It is a Swiss watch. It is not new and my friends are sometimes a little
rude about it. They tell me to buy a new one. But I do not want a new one. I am very happy
with my old watch. Last week it stopped. So I took it to the shop. I did not ask for an estimate （对数量、成本等的）估计；估价. Today I went to get it. Do you know how much I had to pay? Five pounds. Five
pounds just for cleaning(v.) a watch.




Dictation 2: +
Have you ever thought(v.) what it is like to be one of those beautiful girls that you see on
the front of fashion magazines? They meet interesting people, they travel to exciting
places, and sometimes they make a lot of money. But they have to work hard. They often
have to get up very early in the morning, and of course they have to be very careful about
what they eat.
