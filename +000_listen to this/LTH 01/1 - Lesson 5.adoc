Instructor 教练；导师 ;（大学）讲师: Listen to these people. They are all taking things to be repaired. Of course, they want to know /how much it will cost /and how long it will take. Listen to their questions and write the answers you hear. Here is an example.

Woman: That's not bad. But how long will it take? +

I walk to work every morning. I don't work on Saturday afternoon or Sunday and I have a
three-week holiday in the summer.


Instructor: Regine was seventeen then. Now she's twenty-two. Her life is very different.
Listen to this television interview.

and you are only twenty-two. From seventeen to twenty-two. Five years to success. Can
you tell us? The secret of your success?

Regine: The 'secret', as you call it, is work. When I was seventeen, I lived at home. I
walked to the shop every morning. I saved my money and I went to evening classes. I worked in a good department and I sold *so* much *that* I got a good commission 佣金；回扣. I really
wanted to be a success. Now I'm the manager.

Interviewer: Congratulations, Regine. But please tell us ... do you like your job? Are you happier?

Regine: You are asking me two questions. The first answer is 'yes' and the second answer
is definitely 'no'.

Dictation 2:

On my first day in London I felt hungry, so I went into a restaurant and sat down at a table. I waited for ten minutes, but nobody came to serve me. Then I saw that there were no waiters. The customers stood in a queue （人、汽车等的）队，行列 and got their food themselves. That was my first experience of a self-service restaurant.
