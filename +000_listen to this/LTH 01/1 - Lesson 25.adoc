== Section 2

==== A. Memories.

Well, we met at a party in London. You see, I’d just moved to London because of my job and I didn’t really know anybody, and one of the people at work had invited me to this party and so there I was.

But it was one of those boring parties, you know everybody was just sitting in small groups talking to people they knew already, and I was feeling really bored with the whole thing.

And then I noticed this rather attractive girl sitting at the edge of one of the groups, and she was looking bored too, just about as bored as I was. And so we started, um, we started looking at each other, and then I went across and we started talking. And as it turned out she’d only just arrived in London herself so we had quite a bit in common —and well that’s how it all started really.

—What do you mean? We're talking now, aren't we? +
—Oh, yes, but we used to do so much together. +
—We still go to the cinema together, don't we? +
—Yes, but we used to go out for walks together. Remember? +
—Oh, I can remember. It's getting wet in the rain. +
—And we used to do silly things, like running bare foot through the park. +
—Yes. I remember. I used(v.) to catch terrible colds. Honestly, you are being totally
ridiculous. +
—But we never used to argue. You used to think I was wonderful. Once ... (sound of the
door opening) Where are you going? +
—Back to live with my parents. That's something else we used to do before we were
married. Remember?

==== C. Superstitions.

Not long ago I was invited out to dinner by a girl called Sally. I had only met Sally twice, and she was very, very beautiful. I was flattered. "She likes me," I thought. But I *was in for* a disappointment.

"I’m so sorry we asked you *at such short notice*," she said when I arrived, "but we suddenly realised there were going to be thirteen people at the table, so we just had to find somebody else."

A superstition. Thirteen. The unlucky number.

Recently I *came upon* a little group of worried people, gathered round a man lying on the pavement beside a busy London road.

They were waiting for an ambulance, because the man had been knocked down by a passing taxi. Apparently he had stepped off the pavement and into the street, to avoid walking under a ladder.

They say this superstition goes back to the days when the gallows were built on a platform. To get up on to the platform you had to climb a ladder. To pass under the shadow of that ladder was very unlucky …

- 他们说这种迷信, 要追溯到绞刑架建在平台上的时代。要到平台上去，你得爬梯子。从那梯子的阴影下走过, 是非常不吉利的…
====



Other superstitions are not so easily explained. To see a black cat in England is lucky. But if you see a black cat in India, it is considered very unlucky.

There too, if you are about to set out on a long journey, and someone sneezes(v.), you shouldn’t go.

Break a mirror —you will have seven years' bad luck. Find a four-leafed clover, you will have good luck. Just crazy superstitions, of course.

I have an African friend. One day he said to me: "If ever an African says to you that he is not superstitious, that man is a liar." Perhaps that is true of all of us.

==== D. Ghost.


This is Lethbridge’s description of a ghost near Hole House. One of the first incidents happened near to our home in Devon.

One Sunday morning my wife and I were standing on the hill and looking at Hole Mill, which belongs to Mrs. N. I sat down and admired the view.

After a time I heard a motorbicycle start up and I saw the paperman riding off and, as I watched, I saw Mrs. N come out from behind the Mill. She was dressed in a bright blue sweater and had on dark blue tartan trousers and a scarf over her head. She looked up, saw me and waved. I waved back.

At this moment a second figure appeared behind Mrs. N and perhaps a meter from her. She stood looking up at me. Mrs. N went back behind the Mill and the other woman followed.

I did not know her. She looked about sixty-five to seventy years old, was taller than Mrs. N and rather thin. Her face appeared to be tanned(a.) and she had a pointed chin. She was dressed in a dark tweed(a.) coat and skirt and had something which looked like a light grey cardigan beneath her coat.

Her skirt was long. She had a flat-crowned and wide-brimmed round hat on her head. The hat was black and had white flowers around it. She was, in fact, dressed as my aunts used(v.) to dress before the First World War.

She didn’t look like the sort of person who was likely to be staying at Hole Mill today. Later we were leaning over a gate, admiring some calves, when we saw Mrs. N alone. 'Oh,' said my wife, disappointed. 'We were expecting to see two of you.' 'How is that?' asked Mrs. N. 'I have only seen you and the paperman all morning.'

==== E. A Strange Story.

A journalist has a strange story to tell.

I've never been a superstitious person ... never believed in ghosts or things like that.
But, two years ago, something happened which changed my attitude. I still can't explain
it ... somehow I don't think I ever will be able to.

I was living in Frankfurt ... in Germany ... where I was a financial journalist. A very
good friend ... one of my closest friends... we'd been at university together ... was *coming
over* from England by car to see me. He was supposed to get there around six in the
evening ... Saturday evening.


[.my1]
====
- come over 过来；顺便来访
- He was supposed to get there around six in the
evening ... Saturday evening. 他应该在晚上六点左右到那里，周六晚上。
====


I was at home in my flat all that afternoon. At about three in the afternoon, the phone
rang. But ... but when I answered it, there was nobody there ... on the other end, I mean.
Nobody. The phone rang again just a few minutes later. Again, nobody was there ... I
couldn't understand it.



Just a few minutes later, there was a knock at the door. I was in the
kitchen, making some coffee. I remember I was just pouring the boiling water through the
filter when I heard the knock.

I opened the door and there was my friend ... Roger, that
was his name. Roger. He looked a bit ... strange ... pale ... and I said something like
'Roger, how did you get here so early?' He didn't answer ... he just smiled slightly ... he
was a bit like that. He didn't say very much ... I mean, even when I'd known him before, he
often came into my flat without saying very much.



[.my1]
====
- filter (n.)a device containing paper, sand, chemicals, etc. that a liquid or gas is passed through in order to remove any materials that are not wanted 滤器；过滤器 +
-> an air/oil filter 空气过滤器；滤油器 +
image:../img/filter.jpg[,10%]
====




And ... well ... anyway, I said 'Come in'
and went back to the kitchen to finish pouring the coffee. I spoke to him from the kitchen,
but he didn't answer ... didn't say a word ... and I thought that was a bit ... strange ... even
for Roger.

So I *looked round* the door, into the next room, where I thought he was sitting ...
and ... and he wasn't there. The door was still open. I thought for a moment that he'd gone
down to the car to get his luggage ... and then I began to wonder where his girlfriend was.
She was coming with him, you see, from England.


[.my1]
====
- look round = look around : PHRASAL VERB If you look around or look round a building or place, you walk round it and look at the different parts of it. 游览 / 朝四周看, 环顾四周, 环顾

====



Well, then the phone rang again. This time there was somebody there. It was Roger's
girlfriend, and she sounded ... hysterical(a.) ... At first I couldn't understand her. She was still
in Belgium, several hundred kilometers away ... and she told me that she was in a
hospital ... she and Roger had been involved in a car crash, and ... and Roger had just
died ... on the operating table ... just a few minutes before.

- hysterical (a.) in a state of extreme excitement, and crying, laughing, etc. in an uncontrolled way 歇斯底里的；情绪狂暴不可抑止的 /( informal ) extremely funny 极其可笑的

==== Dictation.

It was early afternoon, and the beach was almost empty. It was getting hot now.

Most of the tourists were still finishing their lunch back at the hotel, or taking their afternoon siesta(n.) in the air-conditioned comfort(n.) of their rooms. One or two Englishmen were still lying stretched out on the sand, determined to go home with a good suntan, and a few local children were splashing around in the clear shallow water.

There was a large yacht
moving slowly across the bay. The girl was on board. She was standing at the back of the
boat, getting ready to dive. Jason put on his sunglasses and casually wandered down
towards the sandy(a.) beach.
