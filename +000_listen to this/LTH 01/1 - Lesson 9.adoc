==== C. Monologues:

1.
I hate the stairs. Sometimes the lift 电梯；升降机 isn't working and you have to use the stairs. I can't
get up the stairs by myself; it's my back, you see. Jane, my friend, lives on the *ground floor* 底层，底楼，一楼（建筑物与外面地面相平的一层）,
that's much easier. Nearly every morning I stop there for a cup of tea before I come back
up here.

[.my1]
.案例
====

- lift 电梯；升降机 +
- escalator 自动扶梯；电动楼梯；滚梯

2.
I don't mind living in a tall building. I don't mind the stairs. I quite like the exercise. Of
course, it's difficult for older people but I don't mind if you live on the top floor, like Mrs.
Green, it's not easy. And I don't like the ground floor; I don't think it's safe. But I like my
place. I've got three floors below me and three above, I feel very safe. My Mum lives here
too, on the ground floor.

---

3.
Alice comes every morning. Well, nearly every morning. She's not young any more, you
see, she's seventy-eight next birthday, and it's difficult for her to walk up 登上, 向上走 to the top floor. I
can't go up; I can't move. It's my leg; I've got a bad leg. Carol comes to see me sometimes.
She lives here too, you know, in another flat. She's my daughter.

Dictation 2:

People often ask me for my telephone number. But I have not got a telephone, so I tell them to ring me *at work* 在上班. Why don't I have a telephone? I think the telephone is expensive and I prefer to write a letter. There aren't many people I want to speak to in the evening and I do not want to speak to anybody at breakfast time. When I want to use the telephone in the evening, I can always use the box 小亭；岗亭 at the end of the road.
