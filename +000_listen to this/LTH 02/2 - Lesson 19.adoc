Lesson 19

==  part 1. 部分

Presenter: This week’s financial talk /will be given by our property expert, James Milligan, who is here /to tell us about some surprising new developments /in the London area.

[.my2]
主持人：本周的金融演讲, 将由我们的房地产专家詹姆斯·米利根（James Milligan）主讲，他将向我们介绍伦敦地区一些令人惊讶的新开发项目。

James Milligan: Good afternoon. Not so very long ago /it would have been really unusual /to pay ￡1 million for a house. Unfortunately this is no longer so. `主` Decline in the real value of money /over the past few years /`谓` has made property values rocket (v.)快速增长；猛增. The cheap house is a thing of the past. Now, the sale of a ￡1 million house /no longer causes surprise, nor *is it likely to be* the subject 主题；题目；话题；题材；问题 of a newspaper article.

[.my2]
詹姆斯·米利根：下午好。不久前，花 100 万英镑买一套房子还是很不寻常的。不幸的是，现在情况已不再如此。过去几年货币实际价值的下降导致房地产价值飙升。便宜的房子已经成为过去。现在，出售价值 100 万英镑的房屋不再令人惊讶，也不太可能成为报纸文章的主题。

What exactly can we expect /to get for ￡1 million today? Well, first of all, space, of course. Living in large cities /has made us all tired (v.) of *living in* those cramped (a.)狭窄的；狭小的 little houses and flats /后定 built just after the war.  We now want space; space to live (v.) and relax in, preferably (ad.)更合意地，最好是 with a garden. And this, of course, is what puts the price up.  +
Another reason for needing space is the fact /that we have larger families 后定 growing up under one roof /and even *quite 颇；相当 small children* demand (v.)their own room these days, while teenagers may demand an extra room /where they can entertain (v.)（尤指在自己家中）招待，款待 their friends privately.  +
Also `主` the trend of going out to eat `谓` is dying (v.) out 灭绝 /*due to* rising prices of restaurant and transport 交通运输系统, so people are once more beginning to entertain (v.) and dine (v.)进餐；用饭 at home, which requires a larger dining room. There are numerous new developments in London *at the moment* 现在，当前时间 /which can provide all this and more — if you have the money!

[.my2]
今天我们用 100 万英镑到底能得到什么？嗯，首先当然是空间。生活在大城市让我们都厌倦了住在战后建的那些狭窄的小房子和公寓里。我们现在需要空间；居住和放松的空间，最好有花园。当然，这就是价格上涨的原因。需要空间的另一个原因是，我们有更多的家庭在同一个屋檐下长大，甚至很小的孩子现在也需要自己的房间，而青少年可能需要一个额外的房间，以便他们可以私人招待朋友。此外，由于餐馆和交通价格的上涨，外出就餐的趋势正在消失，因此人们再次开始在家中娱乐和用餐，这需要更大的餐厅。目前伦敦有许多新开发项目可以提供这一切以及更多 - 如果您有钱的话！

At the moment /the most fashionable (a.)流行的；时兴的；时髦的 places seem to be the Barbican, St John’s Wood, Morgan’s Walk in Battersea 地名. +
`主` #People# 后定 wanting quiet (n.)宁静；寂静；平静；安静 in the evening /`谓` #tend# to prefer (v.) the Barbican /后定 situated in the business heart of the city /and therefore *fairly 一定地；相当地 free (a.) of traffic* in the evenings, although several theatres 剧院，戏院 have opened there lately.  +
The Barbican is also for those /后定 who like living high up 在高处, accommodation 住宿；膳宿 *being situated* mostly in tower blocks 高层塔式公寓楼.  +
St John’s Wood, on the other hand, is favoured 较喜欢；选择;优惠；特别照顾；偏袒 mostly by upper-middle class 中上阶层 families /who prefer a detached (a.)单独的；独立的；不连接的 house 后定 surrounded by a walled 有城墙的 garden, thus ensuring their privacy.  +
Gardens *of course* tend to raise (v.) the price of a property. `主` Those not *interested in* gardening `谓` can choose from the grand mansions (公馆；宅第)豪宅 in Battersea where you get a wonderful view of the Thames and are still only a few minutes away from London’s theatres and shops.

[.my2]
目前最时尚的地方似乎是巴比肯、圣约翰伍德、巴特西的摩根步行街。想要晚上安静的人往往更喜欢位于城市商业中心的巴比肯中心，因此晚上的交通相当畅通，尽管最近有几家剧院在那里开业。巴比肯也适合那些喜欢住在高处的人，住宿大多位于塔楼内。另一方面，圣约翰伍德主要受到中上阶层家庭的青睐，他们更喜欢被围墙花园包围的独立住宅，从而确保他们的隐私。花园当然会提高房产的价格。对园艺不感兴趣的人可以选择巴特西的宏伟豪宅，在那里您可以欣赏泰晤士河的美景，并且距离伦敦的剧院和商店仅几分钟路程。

Look around and take your pick. Oh …​ just make sure that you have that million pounds first! Interviewer: Now you’re the First Lady of Jazz; probably the greatest blues singer the world has ever known. Just what is it that makes you sing as you do?

[.my2]
环顾四周并做出选择。哦……​只要确保你先有那一百万英镑就可以了！采访者：现在您是爵士乐第一夫人；可能是世界上最伟大的蓝调歌手。是什么让你如此歌唱？

Singer: I don’t know; one night it’s a little bit slower, the next night it’s a little bit lighter. It’s all according to how I feel. I never feel the same way twice. The blues is a mixed up sort of thing. There’s two kinds of blues; there’s happy blues and there’s sad blues. I don’t think I ever sing the same way twice.

[.my2]
歌手：我不知道；一个晚上它会慢一点，第二天晚上它会轻一点。一切都根据我的感觉。我从来没有两次有同样的感觉。布鲁斯是一种混合的东西。布鲁斯有两种：有快乐的忧郁，也有悲伤的忧郁。我想我从来没有以同样的方式唱过两次。

'''

== part 2. 部分

Interviewer: And how did you become a jazz singer in the first place?

[.my2]
采访者：您最初是如何成为一名爵士歌手的？

Singer: Well, it was all by accident really. You see, I wanted to be a dancer so I went along to try out, you know, to an audition and I was just a kid, I didn’t know how to dance at all. So I kept doing the two steps I did know over and over until they told me to get off the stage. But I guess the pianist felt sort of sorry for me because he called me back and asked me if I could sing. Huh, 'Course I can sing, man,' I told him; 'I’ve been singing all my life. What the hell use is that?' And then he asked me to sing a blues song, St Louis Blues, I think it was, and I just kept on singing and he just kept on playing, and in the end I had a job. That was on West 42nd Street. Now that was the street for jazz in those days. And slowly I became known; people started coming to see me rather than just to listen to the orchestra, and that’s how it started. I mean, it began like that and it’s just been going on ever since.

[.my2]
歌手：嗯，这确实是偶然的。你看，我想成为一名舞者，所以我去尝试，你知道，参加试镜，我只是个孩子，我根本不知道如何跳舞。所以我一遍又一遍地重复我所知道的两个步骤，直到他们告诉我下台。但我猜那位钢琴家对我感到有点遗憾，因为他给我回了电话，问我是否可以唱歌。嗯，“我当然会唱歌，伙计，”我告诉他； “我一生都在唱歌。那到底有什么用？然后他让我唱一首布鲁斯歌曲，圣路易斯布鲁斯，我想是的，我就继续唱，他就继续演奏，最后我找到了一份工作。那是在西42街。那是当时的爵士乐街。慢慢地我就出名了；人们开始来看我，而不仅仅是为了听管弦乐队的演奏，事情就是这样开始的。我的意思是，事情就是这样开始的，从那以后就一直如此。

Interviewer: You’ve never looked back and you’ve been successful ever since?

[.my2]
采访者：从那以后你就再也没有回头，就一直成功了？

Singer: Well, it wasn’t quite as easy as it sounds. I mean, when I started out I didn’t know anything, I mean like chords and sharps and flats. I just sang. But if you’re going to sing jazz you have to know these things. And people were very nice and kind to me and they slowly taught me what key I had to sing each song in. And that’s how I really became a professional musician. I mean, the beginning was just luck, but if you want to stay at the top you really have to know your job. You have to know what you’re doing and you have to know how to be able to change it to go with the public’s taste; with the changing fashions. Otherwise you find yourself out of work and back on the streets where you started from.

[.my2]
歌手：嗯，这并不像听起来那么容易。我的意思是，当我开始时，我什么都不知道，我的意思是和弦、升号和降号。我刚刚唱歌。但如果你要唱爵士乐，你就必须了解这些事情。人们对我非常友善，他们慢慢地教我唱每首歌必须用什么调。这就是我真正成为一名专业音乐家的方式。我的意思是，一开始只是运气，但如果你想保持领先地位，你真的必须了解你的工作。你必须知道自己在做什么，并且知道如何改变它以符合公众的口味；随着时尚的不断变化。否则你会发现自己失业了，又回到了原来的街道。

Interviewer: But surely, you never needed to go with the fashions? I mean, you’ve always been popular.

[.my2]
采访者：但是当然，你从来不需要追随时尚？我的意思是，你一直很受欢迎。

Singer: Well, that’s true up to a point. And if you’re good enough you can even change the fashions. I’ve never done that. I’ve always sung what I wanted and if they didn’t like it, they didn’t have to buy it. I’ve never made a fortune from my music because I won’t sing just any damn thing. I choose what I want to sing. But anything I do sing is part of my life. So it has to be important to me before I’ll sing it. I think this is why people like my music; they know that whatever I say in my songs I really believe and this means something to them and helps them in their lives. I’m not a rich pop singer and never wanted to be. And there’s been a lot of scandal attached to my life. Some of it’s true; some of it’s not. But at least I’ve always been my true self in my music and I’ll always stay that way. I think a guy called Shakespeare once wrote 'Unto thine own self be true and thou canst not then to any man be false'. Well, that’s how I feel when I’m singing my songs. You may like them, you may hate them, but nobody can say that I’m not singing from deep down inside myself. I won’t ever sing anything I don’t believe in although, as I said, it’s never the same way two nights running: it may be happy one night and sad the next. It’s all according to how I feel. And now I’m feeling the need for a drink of something strong; I’ve got four hours on stage tonight and that really takes it out of you, believe me.

[.my2]
辛格：嗯，在某种程度上确实如此。如果你足够优秀，你甚至可以改变时尚。我从来没有这样做过。我总是唱我想要的歌，如果他们不喜欢，他们也不必买。我从来没有靠音乐发过大财，因为我不会唱任何该死的东西。我选择我想唱的内容。但我唱的任何歌都是我生活的一部分。所以在我唱这首歌之前，它对我来说一定很重要。我想这就是人们喜欢我的音乐的原因；他们知道，无论我在歌曲中说什么，我都深信不疑，这对他们来说意义重大，对他们的生活有帮助。我不是一个富有的流行歌手，也从来不想成为。我的生活中有很多丑闻。有些是真的，有些是真的。有些不是。但至少我在音乐中一直是真实的自己，而且我会永远保持这种状态。我想一个叫莎士比亚的人曾经写道：“对你自己要真实，你就不能对任何人虚假”。嗯，这就是我唱歌时的感受。你可能喜欢他们，你可能讨厌他们，但没有人可以说我不是在内心深处唱歌。我永远不会唱任何我不相信的东西，尽管，正如我所说，连续两个晚上的情况永远不会一样：前一个晚上可能很快乐，下一个晚上就会悲伤。一切都根据我的感觉。现在我觉得需要喝点烈性的东西；今晚我在舞台上待了四个小时，这真的让你精疲力竭，相信我。

Interviewer: Go right ahead and thank you for the interview.

[.my2]
采访者：请继续，谢谢您接受我们的采访。

Singer: That’s OK. Here’s a couple of tickets; come and see the show.

[.my2]
歌手：没关系。这是几张票；来看演出。


== part 3. 部分

Now first we must identify the parts of this home computer system. Before we can set up the system, we must all know what the names of the different parts of the computer are and what they do. So first I’m going to tell you the names of the parts and what they are used for in a home computer system.

[.my2]
现在首先我们必须识别这个家庭计算机系统的各个部分。在我们设置系统之前，我们必须知道计算机不同部分的名称是什么以及它们的作用。首先，我将告诉您各个部件的名称以及它们在家用计算机系统中的用途。

First, and most important of all, is your instruction manual. Can you all see that? The instruction manual is the book of instructions — it tells you how to set up your system and then how to use it. OK?

[.my2]
首先，也是最重要的，是您的说明手册。你们都能看到吗？使用手册是一本说明手册——它告诉您如何设置系统以及如何使用它。好的？

Next, the monitor. The monitor is the part that everyone can recognize immediately because it looks just like a television. The monitor shows you the information you have typed in on the screen. You can change the information, move it around or take it away, while it is on the screen. Right?

[.my2]
接下来是显示器。显示器是每个人都能立即认出的部件，因为它看起来就像一台电视。显示器会显示您在屏幕上输入的信息。当信息显示在屏幕上时，您可以更改信息、移动信息或将其删除。正确的？

Now, when you have finished working with your information and you want a copy of this on paper, then you have to use the printer. The printer prints out on paper what you have on the monitor screen. Then you have a copy of your work on paper.

[.my2]
现在，当您处理完信息并想要将其打印在纸上时，您必须使用打印机。打印机将显示器屏幕上的内容打印在纸上。然后你就有了一份纸质作品的副本。

Now the keyboard. The keyboard contains the actual computer and it looks just like a typewriter. Each piece on the keyboard is called a key. You have keys for letters (a, b, c etc.) and keys for instructions to the computer. You have to be able to type if you want to use a computer properly.

[.my2]
现在是键盘。键盘包含实际的计算机，它看起来就像一台打字机。键盘上的每个部分称为一个键。您有字母键（a、b、c 等）和计算机指令键。如果你想正确使用计算机，你必须能够打字。

Now what have we got left? Ah yes, the 2 floppy discs and the disc drive. The disc drive is quite simple — it’s the part of the system that operates the floppy discs, we say it powers the floppy discs. You put the floppy discs into the disc drive and the disc drive makes them work.

[.my2]
现在我们还剩下什么？啊，是的，两张软盘和光驱。磁盘驱动器非常简单——它是系统中运行软盘的部分，我们说它为软盘提供动力。您将软盘放入光盘驱动器，光盘驱动器即可使它们工作。

So finally, the two floppy discs. You need two because the first one contains the programme — that is, the instructions — and the second is where you type in your information and where the program works on this information. So you really work on the second floppy disc: then, when you are ready to print, the printer takes everything from the second floppy disc and prints out what you have done.

[.my2]
最后，两张软盘。您需要两个，因为第一个包含程序（即说明），第二个是您输入信息以及程序处理此信息的位置。因此，您实际上是在第二张软盘上工作：然后，当您准备打印时，打印机会从第二张软盘中取出所有内容并打印出您所做的事情。

Now, is that clear? Are there any questions?

[.my2]
现在，清楚了吗？有没有问题？

== part 4. 部分

There’s no doubt that the computer has enlarged man’s working capacity as well as his intellectual capacity enormously. Er …​ but it brings with it dangers to match the benefits. Now by this, I mean danger to physical and mental well-being of the people who work at computer terminals, not the dangers to personal privacy or national or industrial security.

[.my2]
毫无疑问，计算机极大地提高了人类的工作能力和智力。呃……​但它带来的危险与好处不相上下。现在，我指的是对计算机终端工作人员身心健康的威胁，而不是对个人隐私或国家或工业安全的威胁。

There’s one very alarming set of statistics which come from a survey done in the UK on 800 pregnant women, who happened to use computer terminals for a major part of their working day. In no less than 36% of the subjects there was some severe abnormality during the pregnancy, enough to make a termination necessary. Now these figures compare significantly with a control group of pregnant women of the same age but who did not work with computer terminals. The incidence of severe abnormalities in their case was only 16%. This survey confirms similar investigations carried out in Denmark, Canada, Australia and the USA. Now, no one yet has a clear idea about the exact connection between working with computer terminals and the problems with pregnancy, but the figures at least suggest that there’s, well, a cause for alarm.

[.my2]
英国对 800 名孕妇进行了一项调查，得出了一组非常令人震惊的统计数据，这些孕妇在工作日的大部分时间里碰巧都在使用电脑终端。不少于 36% 的受试者在怀孕期间出现一些严重异常，足以需要终止妊娠。现在，这些数字与同龄但不使用电脑终端的孕妇对照组相比具有显着性差异。他们的病例中严重异常的发生率仅为 16%。这项调查证实了在丹麦、加拿大、澳大利亚和美国进行的类似调查。现在，还没有人清楚地了解使用计算机终端与怀孕问题之间的确切联系，但数据至少表明，有理由引起警惕。

In more general terms, increased stress and disturbances to vision have been noted in workers exposed for long periods to the video screen, and in many countries trade unions of workers involved with computers have laid down their own guidelines to protect members' health. Erm …​ for instance, rest periods, or a change of activity from time to time are recommended, and the terminal should be placed so that there’s a source of natural light, and something else to look at, erm, no blank walls behind the terminal, in other words, so that the operator has a chance to rest his eyes from time to time.

[.my2]
更一般地说，长期暴露在视频屏幕下的工人会受到更大的压力和视力障碍，并且在许多国家，涉及计算机的工人工会已经制定了自己的指导方针来保护成员的健康。呃……例如，建议休息一段时间，或者不时改变活动，并且终端的放置位置应该有自然光源，并且有其他东西可以看，呃，终端后面没有空白的墙壁换句话说，让操作员有机会时不时地休息一下眼睛。

Ironically, it seems that it’s not only those who work with computers who are at risk. Er …​ there’s perhaps more danger for people who use computers for interest or pleasure in their own homes. Now, it’s obviously not possible to impose in the privacy of people’s homes the sort of safeguards that can be applied in the working environment. Most people get so fascinated by what they are doing that they stay in front of the screen for hours on end; some are real fanatics!

[.my2]
具有讽刺意味的是，似乎不仅仅是那些使用计算机的人面临风险。呃……对于那些在家中出于兴趣或娱乐而使用计算机的人来说，可能存在更多危险。现在，显然不可能在人们家中的隐私中施加可应用于工作环境的那种保护措施。大多数人对自己正在做的事情非常着迷，以至于他们会在屏幕前连续呆上几个小时；有些是真正的狂热分子！

But they’re also using their computers in environments which are not specially designed. Er they may be dusty or hot, and not particularly well-lit on the whole.

[.my2]
但他们也在未经专门设计的环境中使用计算机。呃，它们可能布满灰尘或很热，而且总体来说光线不是特别好。

An English magazine for computer enthusiasts recently ran its own survey. The readers were invited to send in an account of any health problems they felt were connected with the use of their computers. Er, interestingly, a long list emerged of complaints both serious and less serious, ranging from constipation because of the long hours spent in sedentary ac …​ inactivity, and backache due to crouching over an inconveniently positioned keyboard, um, right through to a general sense of fatigue owing to having puzzled over a problem for longer than was sensible.

[.my2]
一本针对计算机爱好者的英文杂志最近进行了自己的调查。邀请读者提交一份他们认为与使用计算机有关的任何健康问题的报告。呃，有趣的是，出现了一长串严重和不太严重的投诉，从由于长时间久坐不动而导致的便秘，以及由于蹲在位置不方便的键盘上而导致的背痛，嗯，一直到一般由于对一个问题困惑的时间超过了合理的时间而产生的疲劳感。

The visual disturbances mentioned above were also very common. Some readers who already suffered from short sight found that the condition had worsened, and a rarer complaint, but still one suffered by a significant number, was an itching of the face, which in some cases became a form of dermatitis. It seems that this is due to the electrostatic field of the video screen attracting dust from the atmosphere, which irritates exposed skin. And …​ this is an example of a complaint which is rare in the work situation because there is usually some form of air-conditioning, and quite simply not so much dust and fluff in the air as in a normal home.

[.my2]
上述视觉障碍也很常见。一些已经患有近视的读者发现，情况变得更糟了，还有一种较为罕见的症状，但仍然有相当多的人患有这种症状，那就是面部瘙痒，在某些情况下，这变成了一种皮炎。这似乎是由于视频屏幕的静电场吸引了大气中的灰尘，从而刺激了裸露的皮肤。而且……这是一个在工作环境中很少见的投诉示例，因为通常有某种形式的空调，而且空气中的灰尘和绒毛并不像普通家庭那样多。

Precautions for both types of terminal users remain essentially the same. So, first of all, make sure that there’s an altermative source of light from that of the screen itself. Secondly, rest your eyes frequently, if possible looking at something in the distance to give them a change from the close focus used on the screen. Thirdly, make sure the screen is properly tuned; a shaky or fuzzy image can cause nausea or headaches. Fourthly, make sure your seat and working area are designed so that you’re sitting in a comfortable position, not er …​ screwed up or bent over. And finally, get up regularly and walk about the room. Better still, go out into the fresh air occasionally. Sitting still for hours on end is the best way to encourage a thrombosis in the legs, as well as not being particularly good for the digestion.

[.my2]
两种类型终端用户的预防措施基本相同。因此，首先，确保有屏幕本身的替代光源。其次，经常让眼睛休息，如果可能的话，看看远处的东西，让眼睛从屏幕上的近距离焦点改变过来。第三，确保屏幕调校正确；晃动或模糊的图像可能会导致恶心或头痛。第四，确保您的座椅和工作区域的设计使您坐在舒适的位置，而不是……​拧紧或弯腰。最后，定期起床并在房间里走动。更好的是，偶尔出去呼吸新鲜空气。连续几个小时静坐是促进腿部血栓形成的最佳方式，而且对消化也不是特别有利。

These are all common-sense precautions, but how many home-computer owners wrapped up in the intricacies of some programing problem, or fascinated by some game, are going to remember to use their common sense? Does a generation of short-sighted, constipated, hunched, migraine sufferers with skin problems and circulatory troubles await us?

[.my2]
这些都是常识性的预防措施，但是有多少家庭计算机拥有者在陷入某些复杂的编程问题或着迷于某些游戏时，会记得使用他们的常识呢？等待我们的是近视、便秘、驼背、偏头痛、皮肤问题和循环系统问题的一代人吗？

== part 5. 部分

Of course, scientists have always had their pet theories, and historically all of the following have been linked as companions to heart disease: first, a high level of fat and cholesterol in the diet; second, cigarette smoking; third, physical inactivity; fourth, being overweight; and fifth, high blood pressure.

[.my2]
当然，科学家们一直都有自己喜欢的理论，历史上以下所有因素都与心脏病有关：首先，饮食中脂肪和胆固醇含量过高；第二，吸烟；第三，缺乏身体活动；第四，体重超标；第五，高血压。

There are some similarities between the two men. Both are married, have grown children, are in their mid-fifties, and have been very successful in their business careers. Both are hard workers and have achieved a position of financial security and responsibility in their jobs. Their professional lives are not easy for either of them. But life for Adam has been full of tension, and hostility, whereas for Bert, life has been much more enjoyable.

[.my2]
这两个人之间有一些相似之处。两人都已婚，孩子都已长大，都已五十多岁，并且在商业生涯中都非常成功。两人都是努力工作的人，并在工作中获得了经济保障和责任感。他们的职业生涯对他们来说都不容易。但亚当的生活充满了紧张和敌意，而伯特的生活却愉快得多。

Adam always seems to be fighting time, trying to do more things in a day than he previously has done. If situations beyond his control cause delays in his schedule, he becomes angry and hostile. He resents people who are not on time or who do not move as quickly as he does. It is very important to him that he fill up every minute with some kind of productive activity.

[.my2]
亚当似乎总是在与时间作斗争，试图在一天内做比以前更多的事情。如果他无法控制的情况导致他的日程延误，他就会变得愤怒和敌对。他讨厌那些不准时或行动不如他快的人。对他来说，让每一分钟都充满某种富有成效的活动是非常重要的。

However, Bert shows an opposite tendency. Once work is behind him for the day, he devotes himself to three or four interesting hobbies. In addition to his regular physical exercise, he is an enthusiastic reader. He prefers history and historical novels. His special interest is the Second World War, and he prizes all the new information which he can gather about that time period. He also enjoys gardening and likes to fix things around the house. He has a very complete tool collection which he uses to improve his house.

[.my2]
然而，Bert却表现出相反的倾向。一旦一天的工作结束，他就会全身心投入三到四个有趣的爱好。除了定期进行体育锻炼外，他还是一位热心的读者。他更喜欢历史和历史小说。他特别感兴趣的是第二次世界大战，并且珍视他能收集到的有关那段时期的所有新信息。他还喜欢园艺，喜欢修理房子周围的东西。他拥有非常完整的工具收藏，用来改善他的房子。
