Lesson 15



== 1

A: Did you hear [on the news] today about that ... uh ... murderer 后定 who was executed (v.)（尤指依法）处决，处死?


B: I can't believe it.


A: Yeah. That's the first time in ten years /that they've used *capital (a.)死刑的 punishment* 死刑；极刑.

[.my1]
.案例
====
.capital
-> 这个词来源于拉丁语caput，意思是“头”。大写字母，在一词之“头”，因此叫capital。另外，一个国家首都，可以说是一个国家的“头脑所在”，“首”就是“头”，因此也叫capital。在建筑上，柱冠、柱顶部分也叫capital，因为它位于“头”部。capital作“资本”讲时，也来源于caput，即“头”与cattle（家畜、牛群）同出一源。在最初的时候，人们的财富，或“资本”，是以他的家畜头数来计算的，即有多少“头”。

.本句中的第二个that, 是否是多余的?
chatgpt说: 实际上，第二个 "that" 在语法上并不是必需的，你可以将其省略以简化句子。修正后的版本是："That’s the first time in ten years they’ve used capital punishment." 意思不变，但句子更为简洁。有时人们在表达中可能选择保留 "that" 以增加语气或强调，但在这个句子中，省略它是常见的做法。
====

B: I just can't *believe in* our society today *that* they would actually kill another human being. Nobody has the right to take another person's life.


A: Oh, I don't agree. Listen, I think capital punishment is — it's about time it came back. I think that's exactly what killers deserve.

[.my2]
我认为死刑是时候恢复了。我觉得这就是杀手应得的报应。


B: No, they don't deserve that. Because once you're killing a killer, you're the killer, too. You become a killer as well.


A: No, listen. You take a life, you have to be willing to give up your own. And also, I think that if you have a death penalty (n.)惩罚；处罚；刑罚 /it will prevent other people from killing. I think it's a good deterrent 威慑因素；遏制力.

[.my2]
你夺走一条生命，你就得愿意放弃自己的生命。而且，我认为如果你有死刑，它会阻止其他人杀人。我认为这是一个很好的威慑。

B: I don't think it's a good deterrent at all. My *goodness gracious* 我的天啊. I mean, first of all, are you sure `主` the person you've convicted (v.)证明…有罪；宣判（某人）有罪 to death `系` is really guilty?

[.my1]
.案例
====
.GOODNESS!| GOODNESS ME! | MY GOODNESS! | GOODNESS GRACIOUS!
( informal ) used to express surprise天哪；啊呀

goodness: (n.) the quality of being good 善良；优良；美德 +
gracious : (a.)~ (to sb)( of God上帝 ) showing kindness and mercy仁慈的；慈悲的；宽大的

====

A: Well, I think that's a very rare  少见的，不常发生的 ... very rare incidence.


B: I don't think it's rare, (I don't think it's ...) with all the cracker jack lawyers we have today, (Well, no ... I ...) and the judicial (a.)法庭的；法官的；审判的；司法的 system the way it is.


A: I think it's a rare incidence, and I think it's more important /to get rid of the ... the bad seed, you know?


B: But you don't get rid of it. You rehabilitate (v.)使（重病患者）康复；使（长期服刑者）恢复正常生活 somebody like that. (Oh ...) You don't eliminate 排除；清除；消除, you rehabilitate.


A: Listen, studies show that /criminals 罪犯 are never really rehabilitated. When they're ... when they come out of prison /they just go back to a life of crime, and they're hardened (v.)（使）更坚定，更强硬;使变得无情；使不被打动 by that crime.


B: Because the rehabilitation 康复，复原；（权利、名誉的）恢复；修复，翻新 process has to be more than 不仅仅是,不只是 just what's in jail. I mean, (Oh ... well.) when you're in jail /you do have to work, but when you're out of jail /there has to be an extensive 广大的；大量的;广泛的；广博的 program. We have to expand on the idea /till it works.

[.my2]
改过自新的过程不仅仅是在监狱里。

[.my1]
.案例
====
more than + 名词(动名词),意思是"不仅仅是","不只是"。 +
- *We need more than money*; we need time, too.  我们不只需要钱,我们也需要时间 +
- My trip to Beijing *is more than sightseeing*.  我去北京不仅仅是观光。
====


A: I don't agree. Listen — and, anyway, the jails and the prisons are already very crowded 拥挤的，塞满的, and we have to pay, the taxpayers. Our money goes to maintaining murderers' (I ...) lives 生存；活着.


B: I agree with you. That's why it's important to look at the problem on a much larger scale. The real problem is a social problem. (What ... no ...) There are other problems that cause people to kill. Look at poverty, drugs, discrimination 歧视，区别对待.


A: Some people are just bad. They're just evil and there's nothing you can do.


B: No, there ... it is ... no, it isn't true. There's rehabilitation. (No.) And they ... we're all responsible it ... for ... to humanity. That's one of the reasons ...


A: Well, but in the meantime you have to take care of the people who have already committed 做出（错或非法的事）；犯（罪或错等）;承诺，保证（做某事、遵守协议或遵从安排等） ...


B: I agree with you there.


A: Preventative 预防疗法；预防物 is different, but ...


B: I agree with you there.

A：你今天在新闻中听说过那个……呃……凶手被处决了吗？

Announcer 广播员；宣告者: On 'TV Magazine' tonight /we're looking at people who have given up regular jobs and high salaries /to start a new way of life. First of all, we have two interviews 访谈；面试；面谈 with people /who decided to leave the 'rat race'. Nicola Burgess spoke to them.

Nicola: This is the Isle 岛 of Skye 岛名. Behind me /you can see the croft （尤指苏格兰的）小农场，小农场上的住宅 belonging to Daniel and Michelle Burns, who gave up their jobs /to come to this remote area of Scotland. Daniel was the sales manager of Hi-Vita, the breakfast cereal 谷类植物,谷类食物 company, and Michelle was a successful advertising executive （公司或机构的）经理，主管领导，管理人员. Michelle, can you tell us /what made you give up everything to come here?

[.my1]
.案例
====
.croft
-> 词源不详。参照电影《古墓丽影》女主角名字 Lara Croft。
====

Michelle: Everything? That's a matter of opinion 这是个见仁见智的问题. A big house and two cars isn't everything! Dan and I both used to work long hours. We had to leave #so# early in the morning /and we came home #so# late at night, #that# we hardly ever saw each other. We should have come here years ago 多年前, but we were earning #such# big salaries 薪金，薪水（尤指按月发放的） #that# we were afraid to leave our jobs. In the end /we had #so# little time together /#that# our marriage was breaking up. So two years ago, we took a week's holiday in the Scottish Highlands. We saw this place /and we both fell in love with it. It was for sale, and we liked it #so# much /#that# we decided to give up our jobs, and here we are!


Nicola: How do you earn a living? If you don't mind me asking.


Michelle: We don't need very much. We keep sheep and goats 山羊, grow our own vegetables. We've got a few chickens. It's a very simple life, and we're not in it for profit 利润，盈利. We're still #so# busy /#that# we work *from* five in the morning *until* eight at night, but we're together. We're happier *than* we're ever been /and we're leading a natural life.


Nicola: There must be some things you miss, surely.


Michelle: I don't know. We knew such a lot of people in London, but they weren't real friends. We see our neighbours occasionally /and there's #such# a lot to do on the farm /#that# we don't have time to feel lonely. At least 至少 we see each other now.


Nicola: The motor-bike I'm sitting on `系`  is a very special one. Special because it's been *all the way* 一直到底，一路上；完全地，彻底地 round the world. It belongs to Luke Saunders, who has just returned to England /after a three year motor-cycle journey. Luke, what led you to leave your job /and make this trip?


Luke: I worked in a car factory /on the *assembly (n.)装配；组装；总成 line* 流水线. All I had to do was *put* four nuts 螺母，螺帽 *on* the bolts 螺栓 /that hold the wheels on. It's done by robots now, and a good thing too! The job was #so# routine #that# I didn't have to think at all. I bought this Triumph 750 cc bike second-hand, fitted two panniers 挂篮，货筐 on the back /and just *set off* 出发，启程 for Australia.

[.my2]
这份工作太常规了，我根本不需要思考。

====

Nicola: What did you do *for* money?


Luke: I had a bit of money to start with, but of course /it didn't last long /and I had to find work where I could. I've done so many different things — picked fruit, washed up, worked as a mechanic.


Nicola: How did people react (v.)起反应；（对…）作出反应；回应 to you? In India, for example.


Luke: Everywhere I went, the people were #so# friendly /#that# problems seemed to solve themselves 问题似乎会自行解决. There was #such# a lot of interest in the bike /#that# it was easy to start a conversation. You know, often you can communicate /without really knowing the language.


Nicola: Did you ever feel like giving up, turning round 转身，转向；归航 and coming home?


Luke: Only once, in Bangladesh 孟加拉国. I became #so# ill with food poisoning /#that# I had to go to hospital. But it didn't last long.


Nicola: You've had #such# an exciting time #that# you'll find it difficult to settle down, won't you?


Luke: I'm not going to 不打算. Next week I'm off again, but this time I'm going in the opposite direction! See you in about three years' time!

播音员：在今晚的“电视杂志”中，我们正在关注那些放弃正常工作和高薪开始新生活方式的人。首先，我们采访了两次决定退出“激烈竞争”的人。尼古拉·伯吉斯与他们交谈。

Cheese  干酪，奶酪 is one of those foods /that we tend *to take for granted* 认为…是理所当然 *as* always having been with us, and #it#'s odd to think /#that# someone somewhere must have discovered the process /that *takes place* /when micro-organisms get into milk /and bring about changes in its physical and biochemical 生物化学的 structure.

[.my2]
奶酪是这样一种食物 -- 我们理所当然地认为"它一直与我们同在", 因此如果某人有下面这种想法, 就会变得奇怪 -- "历史上某个地方的某个人, 他一定会发现了这个现象: 当微生物进入牛奶, 并改变了其物理和生化结构的过程时, 这个(发酵)过程就发生了".

====


[.my2]
早期的奶酪, 可能是相当难吃的东西，所谓的“新鲜奶酪”无味无味，在牛奶凝固后立即食用，而“成熟”奶酪口感粗糙且咸，这是通过在软的新鲜奶酪中加入盐，并允许其他生化过程继续进行，从而产生更强的味道和更坚实的纹理质地。



The ancient Romans changed all that. They were great pioneers in the art of cheese-making, and `主` the different varieties of cheese 后定 they invented /and the techniques for producing them /`谓` *spread* [with them] *to* the countries they invaded. This dissemination 宣传，散播 of new techniques *took place* between about 60 BC and 300 AD. You can still trace their influence in the English word 'cheese', which comes ultimately 最终，最后 from the Latin word 'caseus', that's C-A-S-E-U-S.

[.my2]
在罗马时期之后，各国的奶酪生产商相对安宁地进行着各自特色的发展。令人惊讶的是，基本上采用相同工艺，却能产生如此多样的风味。

*At this stage* in history, people weren't *#aware#* [in a scientific 科学（上）的；关于科学的 way] *#of#* the role of different micro-organisms and enzymes 酶 in producing different types of cheese. But they knew from experience that /if you kept your milk or your 'pre-cheese' mixture /at a certain temperature /or in a certain environment, things would turn out in a certain way. The Roquefort caves in France are an example of a place /that *was used* for centuries *for* the ripening （使）成熟，催熟 of a certain sort of cheese, before people knew exactly *why they produced (v.) the effect* they did.

[.my2]
在历史的这个阶段，人们还没有科学地意识到, 不同的微生物和酶, 在生产不同类型的奶酪中的作用。但他们从经验中知道，如果你把牛奶或“预奶酪”混合物, 放在一定的温度或特定的环境中，事情就会以某种方式发生。法国的罗克福洞穴就是一个例子，几个世纪以来，人们一直用它来熟化某种奶酪，直到人们确切地知道它们为什么会产生这样的效果。



In the nineteenth century, with the increasing knowledge about micro-organisms, there came the next great step forward in cheese-making. Once it was known exactly /which micro-organisms were involved /in the different stages of producing a cheese, and how the presence of different micro-organisms affected the taste, it was possible /to introduce 引进（动物或植物）；传入（疾病）;推行；实施；采用 them deliberately, and to industrialize （使）工业化 the process.

[.my2]
19世纪，随着人们对微生物的了解不断增加，奶酪制作又向前迈出了一大步。一旦确切地知道了哪些微生物参与了奶酪生产的不同阶段，以及不同微生物的存在如何影响奶酪的味道，就有可能有意地引入它们，并使这一过程工业化。




Cheese started *being made* on a large scale in factories, although `主` the small producer 后定 working from his farm dairy `谓` continued to exist and still exist today. Cheese-making *moved* very much /*into* the world of technology and industrial processes, although, because the aim is still to produce something that people like to eat, there's still an important role for human judgement. People still *go round* （常处于某种状态或以某种方式行动）习惯于 tasting the young cheese at different stages /to see how it's *getting on*, and may add a bit of this or that /to improve the final taste. Whatever the scale of production, there is still room for art *alongside 在…旁边；沿着…的边;与…一起；与…同时 the technology*.

[.my2]
奶酪开始在工厂大规模生产，尽管"日常在自己农场工作"的小生产者，今天仍然存在。奶酪制作在很大程度上进入了技术和工业流程的世界，尽管，因为它的目标仍然是生产人们喜欢吃的东西，人类的判断仍然扮演着重要的角色。人们仍然会在不同的阶段品尝新鲜的奶酪，看看它是如何形成的，并可能添加一些这样或那样的东西来改善最终的味道。无论生产规模如何，艺术仍然有发展的空间.

All cultures change, even modern ones. As a matter of fact 事实上,实际上, change occurs most rapidly in modern cultures, since science brings us so many new discoveries every day.
