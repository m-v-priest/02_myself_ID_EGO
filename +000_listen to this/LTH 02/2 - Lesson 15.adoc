Lesson 15



== 1

A: Did you hear [on the news] today about that ... uh ... murderer 后定 who was executed (v.)（尤指依法）处决，处死?


B: I can't believe it.


A: Yeah. That's the first time in ten years /that they've used *capital (a.)死刑的 punishment* 死刑；极刑.

[.my1]
.案例
====
.capital
-> 这个词来源于拉丁语caput，意思是“头”。大写字母，在一词之“头”，因此叫capital。另外，一个国家首都，可以说是一个国家的“头脑所在”，“首”就是“头”，因此也叫capital。在建筑上，柱冠、柱顶部分也叫capital，因为它位于“头”部。capital作“资本”讲时，也来源于caput，即“头”与cattle（家畜、牛群）同出一源。在最初的时候，人们的财富，或“资本”，是以他的家畜头数来计算的，即有多少“头”。

.本句中的第二个that, 是否是多余的?
chatgpt说: 实际上，第二个 "that" 在语法上并不是必需的，你可以将其省略以简化句子。修正后的版本是："That’s the first time in ten years they’ve used capital punishment." 意思不变，但句子更为简洁。有时人们在表达中可能选择保留 "that" 以增加语气或强调，但在这个句子中，省略它是常见的做法。
====

B: I just can't *believe in* our society today *that* they would actually kill another human being. Nobody has the right to take another person's life.


A: Oh, I don't agree. Listen, I think capital punishment is — it's about time it came back. I think that's exactly what killers deserve.

[.my2]
我认为死刑是时候恢复了。我觉得这就是杀手应得的报应。


B: No, they don't deserve that. Because once you're killing a killer, you're the killer, too. You become a killer as well.


A: No, listen. You take a life, you have to be willing to give up your own. And also, I think that if you have a death penalty (n.)惩罚；处罚；刑罚 /it will prevent other people from killing. I think it's a good deterrent 威慑因素；遏制力.

[.my2]
你夺走一条生命，你就得愿意放弃自己的生命。而且，我认为如果你有死刑，它会阻止其他人杀人。我认为这是一个很好的威慑。

B: I don't think it's a good deterrent at all. My *goodness gracious* 我的天啊. I mean, first of all, are you sure `主` the person you've convicted (v.)证明…有罪；宣判（某人）有罪 to death `系` is really guilty?

[.my1]
.案例
====
.GOODNESS!| GOODNESS ME! | MY GOODNESS! | GOODNESS GRACIOUS!
( informal ) used to express surprise天哪；啊呀

goodness: (n.) the quality of being good 善良；优良；美德 +
gracious : (a.)~ (to sb)( of God上帝 ) showing kindness and mercy仁慈的；慈悲的；宽大的

====

A: Well, I think that's a very rare  少见的，不常发生的 ... very rare incidence.


B: I don't think it's rare, (I don't think it's ...) with all the cracker jack lawyers we have today, (Well, no ... I ...) and the judicial (a.)法庭的；法官的；审判的；司法的 system the way it is.


A: I think it's a rare incidence, and I think it's more important /to get rid of the ... the bad seed, you know?


B: But you don't get rid of it. You rehabilitate (v.)使（重病患者）康复；使（长期服刑者）恢复正常生活 somebody like that. (Oh ...) You don't eliminate 排除；清除；消除, you rehabilitate.


A: Listen, studies show that /criminals 罪犯 are never really rehabilitated. When they're ... when they come out of prison /they just go back to a life of crime, and they're hardened (v.)（使）更坚定，更强硬;使变得无情；使不被打动 by that crime.


B: Because the rehabilitation 康复，复原；（权利、名誉的）恢复；修复，翻新 process has to be more than 不仅仅是,不只是 just what's in jail. I mean, (Oh ... well.) when you're in jail /you do have to work, but when you're out of jail /there has to be an extensive 广大的；大量的;广泛的；广博的 program. We have to expand on the idea /till it works.

[.my2]
改过自新的过程不仅仅是在监狱里。

[.my1]
.案例
====
more than + 名词(动名词),意思是"不仅仅是","不只是"。 +
- *We need more than money*; we need time, too.  我们不只需要钱,我们也需要时间 +
- My trip to Beijing *is more than sightseeing*.  我去北京不仅仅是观光。
====


A: I don't agree. Listen — and, anyway, the jails and the prisons are already very crowded 拥挤的，塞满的, and we have to pay, the taxpayers. Our money goes to maintaining murderers' (I ...) lives 生存；活着.


B: I agree with you. That's why it's important to look at the problem on a much larger scale. The real problem is a social problem. (What ... no ...) There are other problems that cause people to kill. Look at poverty, drugs, discrimination 歧视，区别对待.


A: Some people are just bad. They're just evil and there's nothing you can do.


B: No, there ... it is ... no, it isn't true. There's rehabilitation. (No.) And they ... we're all responsible it ... for ... to humanity. That's one of the reasons ...


A: Well, but in the meantime you have to take care of the people who have already committed 做出（错或非法的事）；犯（罪或错等）;承诺，保证（做某事、遵守协议或遵从安排等） ...


B: I agree with you there.


A: Preventative 预防疗法；预防物 is different, but ...


B: I agree with you there.

A：你今天在新闻中听说过那个……呃……凶手被处决了吗？

Daniel was the sales manager of Hi-Vita, the breakfast cereal 谷类植物,谷类食物 company, and Michelle was a successful advertising executive （公司或机构的）经理，主管领导，管理人员. Michelle, can you tell us /what made you give up everything to come here?

[.my1]
.案例

.croft
-> 词源不详。参照电影《古墓丽影》女主角名字 Lara Croft。
====

Michelle: Everything? That's a matter of opinion 这是个见仁见智的问题. A big house and two cars isn't everything! Dan and I both used to work long hours. We had to leave #so# early in the morning /and we came home #so# late at night, #that# we hardly ever saw each other. We should have come here years ago 多年前, but we were earning #such# big salaries 薪金，薪水（尤指按月发放的） #that# we were afraid to leave our jobs. In the end /we had #so# little time together /#that# our marriage was breaking up. So two years ago, we took a week's holiday in the Scottish Highlands. We saw this place /and we both fell in love with it. It was for sale, and we liked it #so# much /#that# we decided to give up our jobs, and here we are!


Nicola: How do you earn a living? If you don't mind me asking.


Michelle: We don't need very much. We keep sheep and goats 山羊, grow our own vegetables. We've got a few chickens. It's a very simple life, and we're not in it for profit 利润，盈利. We're still #so# busy /#that# we work *from* five in the morning *until* eight at night, but we're together. We're happier *than* we're ever been /and we're leading a natural life.


Nicola: There must be some things you miss, surely.


Michelle: I don't know. We knew such a lot of people in London, but they weren't real friends. We see our neighbours occasionally /and there's #such# a lot to do on the farm /#that# we don't have time to feel lonely. At least 至少 we see each other now.


Nicola: The motor-bike I'm sitting on `系`  is a very special one. Special because it's been *all the way* 一直到底，一路上；完全地，彻底地 round the world. It belongs to Luke Saunders, who has just returned to England /after a three year motor-cycle journey. Luke, what led you to leave your job /and make this trip?


Luke: I worked in a car factory /on the *assembly (n.)装配；组装；总成 line* 流水线. All I had to do was *put* four nuts 螺母，螺帽 *on* the bolts 螺栓 /that hold the wheels on. It's done by robots now, and a good thing too! The job was #so# routine #that# I didn't have to think at all. I bought this Triumph 750 cc bike second-hand, fitted two panniers 挂篮，货筐 on the back /and just *set off* 出发，启程 for Australia.

Nicola: What did you do *for* money?


Luke: I had a bit of money to start with, but of course /it didn't last long /and I had to find work where I could. I've done so many different things — picked fruit, washed up, worked as a mechanic.


Nicola: How did people react (v.)起反应；（对…）作出反应；回应 to you? In India, for example.


Luke: Everywhere I went, the people were #so# friendly /#that# problems seemed to solve themselves 问题似乎会自行解决. There was #such# a lot of interest in the bike /#that# it was easy to start a conversation. You know, often you can communicate /without really knowing the language.


Nicola: Did you ever feel like giving up, turning round 转身，转向；归航 and coming home?


Luke: Only once, in Bangladesh 孟加拉国. I became #so# ill with food poisoning /#that# I had to go to hospital. But it didn't last long.


Nicola: You've had #such# an exciting time #that# you'll find it difficult to settle down, won't you?


Luke: I'm not going to 不打算. Next week I'm off again, but this time I'm going in the opposite direction! See you in about three years' time!

At this stage in history, people weren't aware in a scientific way of the role of different micro-organisms and enzymes in producing different types of cheese. But they knew from experience that if you kept your milk or your 'pre-cheese' mixture at a certain temperature or in a certain environment, things would turn out in a certain way. The Roquefort caves in France are an example of a place that was used for centuries for the ripening of a certain sort of cheese, before people knew exactly why they produced the effect they did.





In the nineteenth century, with the increasing knowledge about micro-organisms, there came the next great step forward in cheese-making. Once it was known exactly which micro-organisms were involved in the different stages of producing a cheese, and how the presence of different micro-organisms affected the taste, it was possible to introduce them deliberately, and to industrialize the process.





Cheese started being made on a large scale in factories, although the small producer working from his farm dairy continued to exist and still exist today. Cheese-making moved very much into the world of technology and industrial processes, although, because the aim is still to produce something that people like to eat, there's still an important role for human judgement. People still go round tasting the young cheese at different stages to see how it's getting on, and may add a bit of this or that to improve the final taste. Whatever the scale of production, there is still room for art alongside the technology.

奶酪是我们理所当然地认为一直伴随着我们的食物之一，奇怪的是，认为某个地方的某个人一定已经发现了微生物进入牛奶并导致其物理变化时发生的过程，这很奇怪。和生化结构。


显然，我们不知道是谁发现了这个过程，但人们认为它来自大约 8000 年前的西南亚。


早期的奶酪可能是相当难吃的东西，对于所谓的“新鲜奶酪”来说，它无味且乏味，在牛奶凝固后立即食用，而对于“成熟”奶酪来说，味道粗糙且咸。是通过在柔软的新鲜奶酪中添加盐并让其他生化过程继续进行而制成的，从而产生更浓郁的味道和更坚实的质地。


古罗马人改变了这一切。他们是奶酪制作艺术的伟大先驱，他们发明的不同品种的奶酪及其生产技术随着他们传播到了他们入侵的国家。新技术的传播大约发生在公元前 60 年至公元 300 年之间。您仍然可以在英语单词“cheese”中追踪它们的影响，该单词最终源自拉丁语单词“caseus”，即 C-A-S-E-U-S。


好吧，罗马时期之后，事情进展得很平静，不同国家的奶酪生产商都在开发自己的特色奶酪。令人惊奇的是，您可以通过基本相同的过程获得多种口味。


在历史的这个阶段，人们并没有以科学的方式意识到不同微生物和酶在生产不同类型奶酪中的作用。但他们从经验中知道，如果你将牛奶或“奶酪预制”混合物保持在一定的温度或特定的环境中，事情就会以某种方式发生。法国的羊乳干酪洞穴就是一个例子，在人们确切知道为什么它们会产生这种效果之前，几个世纪以来，这个地方一直被用来催熟某种奶酪。


十九世纪，随着对微生物的了解不断增加，奶酪制作又向前迈出了一大步。一旦确切地知道哪些微生物参与了奶酪生产的不同阶段，以及不同微生物的存在如何影响味道，就可以有意地引入它们，并使该过程工业化。


奶酪开始在工厂大规模生产，尽管在农场乳制品厂工作的小生产商仍然存在，并且至今仍然存在。奶酪制作在很大程度上进入了技术和工业流程的世界，尽管如此，因为目的仍然是生产人们喜欢吃的东西，所以人类的判断仍然发挥着重要作用。人们仍然会在不同阶段品尝新鲜的奶酪，看看它的进展情况，并可能添加一些这样或那样的东西来改善最终的味道。无论生产规模如何，艺术与技术一起仍然有发展的空间。

1. All cultures change, even modern ones. As a matter of fact, change occurs most rapidly in modern cultures, since science brings us so many new discoveries every day. It is rather difficult to follow these changes clearly, since they happen so fast. The civilization that I will discuss today is easier to observe.


2. No formal history was written for these early Indians, but Navajo Indians who came along later found evidence of their great civilization. The Navajos called these prehistoric people 'the Anasazi', which means, 'the Ancient Ones'.


3. Descendants of the Anasazi still live in the Southwest, and many aspects of their culture are similar to ancient times. Today these people are called Pueblo Indians.


4. There are four different time periods in the development of the Anasazi. Scientists have looked for the one most important theme in this story, a kind of unifying idea to organize all the facts. The most critical and influential improvement in their lives was the way they used containers to cook, store, and carry food and water.


5. The most important job of the man in this society was to learn, teach, and perform the religious ceremonies associated with farming. Women worked in the fields and prepared all the food. Women also wove baskets out of yucca fibers.


6. We don't know what the final problem was. It might have been enemy attack, sickness, lack of rain, or over-farmed soil. But in the year 1300 the last of the Anasazi left the cliff dwellings, never to return again. They left behind their beautiful pueblos, which still stand as a monument to them.

所有文化都会发生变化，即使是现代文化。事实上，现代文化中的变化发生得最快，因为科学每天都给我们带来许多新发现。清楚地跟踪这些变化相当困难，因为它们发生得太快了。我今天要讨论的文明更容易观察。


没有为这些早期印第安人写下正式的历史，但后来出现的纳瓦霍印第安人发现了他们伟大文明的证据。纳瓦霍人称这些史前民族为“阿纳萨齐人”，意思是“古代人”。


阿纳萨齐人的后裔仍然生活在西南部，他们的文化的许多方面与古代相似。今天这些人被称为普韦布洛印第安人。


阿纳萨齐的发展经历了四个不同的时期。科学家们一直在寻找这个故事中最重要的主题，即一种组织所有事实的统一思想。他们生活中最关键和最有影响力的改进是他们使用容器来烹饪、储存和携带食物和水的方式。


在这个社会中，男人最重要的工作是学习、教授和执行与农业相关的宗教仪式。妇女们在田里干活并准备所有的食物。妇女还用丝兰纤维编织篮子。


我们不知道最后的问题是什么。可能是敌人的攻击、疾病、缺雨或过度耕种的土壤。但在 1300 年，最后一批阿纳萨齐人离开了悬崖住宅，再也没有回来。他们留下了美丽的普韦布洛，这些普韦布洛至今仍然矗立着，作为他们的纪念碑。

== 独立主格结构 Absolute Construction

==== 说明1

*其实"独立主格"和"非谓语动词"本质上是一回事，区分只是"非谓语动词的逻辑主语"是"整句的主语"还是"独立的主语"的问题。*

*独立主格就是: 当两个主语不同的句子进行合并的时候，就可以把其中一个句子的谓语动词, 阉割成「非谓语动词」，同时保留其主语作为一个"独立于句子主语之外的主语"（主格）*

*验证"独立主格"(里面没有谓语, 只有非谓语动词)用的是否对的方法, 就是把「be」动词(是"谓语",而不是"非谓语动词"的标志)加回去，加上「be」动词之后, 如果是一个完整正确的句子，就是对的，否则就错。*

- His friends *to come* tonight, he is busy preparing the dinner. +
显然，整句的主语是「he」，而「His friends」是独立的主语，非谓语动词「to come」的逻辑主语是「His friends」。 +
独立主格的部分加上be动词，即「His friends are to come tonight」是完整正确的句子，所以这个是对的。 +
如果在前面加上with，也是对的，那么「*with* his friends to come tonight」其实就是一个介宾短语结构，做整个句子的状语。

- The boy *leading* (表进行或主动) the way, we had no trouble getting out of the forest. +
验证：加入be之后, The boy is leading the way正确。

- The test *finished* (表完成或被动), we’ll have our summer vacation. +
验证：The test is finished.正确。


- I received many Christmas gifts, some of them *books* (名词). +
验证：some of them are books.正确。

- He turned to me, his eyes *sleepy* (形容词). +
验证：his eyes are sleepy.正确。

- School *over* (介词短语), we all went home. +
验证：School is over.正确。

注意：

1）在with/ without复合结构中，多数情况下with能省略，但without不能省略，但是可以改为其他否定形式。 +
- *Without* his homework *done*, Peter went out to play.


2）如果意义明确，独立主格中的冠词或代词, 可以省略。 +
- The guard stood by the door, (a) gun *in (his) hand*.


3）独立主格结构中的being, 如下情况不能省略：

There being 时: +
- *There being* no bus, we had to walk home.

逻辑主语是代词时 : +
- *It being* Sunday, all the offices are closed.

'''

==== 说明2

记住3点:

- *独立主格结构, 在句中利用它来作"状语"的作用.  它的外表形式是: n./pron. + a. /ad. /介词短语 /doing /to do 等.  加号前后的两者, 在逻辑上是有"主谓关系"的.*
- *"独立主格结构的逻辑主语", 与"句子的主语"不是同一个对象。*
- *独立主格结构, 一般用逗号与主句分开，与主句之间不用任何连接词。* +
使用分词短语、独立主格结构、with ... 在句子中作"状语"时, 要注意：它们与主句之间不应有从属连词（如when, if, as soon as, as, while等）或并列连词（如and, but, or, so等）。
