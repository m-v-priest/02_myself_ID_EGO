Lesson 26 +


== part


Interest in sport in Britain is widespread, as is indicated by the huge crowds which attend such occasions as the Football Association Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, international rugby matches at Twickenham, Murrayfield or Cardiff Arms Park, the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Championships and so on. Not only do millions watch these matches on television but there is also growing enthusiasm for active participation in sport and recreation in the country as a whole. People find they have more free time on their hands nowadays, so there is a duty on the part of government to make opportunities and facilities available. Apart from the professional side of it, there is increasing enthusiasm for amateur sport, which has led to a growth in interest in climbing, rambling, boating and other water-based sports, as well as keep fit, and movement and dance activities. +

 +

Probably the most popular spectator sport is Association Football, which dates back to the nineteenth century and is controlled by separate football associations in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. There are well over 400 clubs affiliated to the English Football Association or FA and some 37,000 clubs to regional or district associations. The main clubs in England and Wales belong to the Football League, 92 in all, and the 38 Scottish clubs belong to the Scottish League. They play in four divisions in England and three in Scotland. During the football season, attendances total some 27 million. +

 +

Local authorities provide facilities to cater for a wide range of indoor and outdoor activities; these include such things as golf courses, swimming pools and leisure centres. Total expenditure in the country as a whole on sport and outdoor recreation came to well over ￡500 million last year. +

 +

Naturally, publicly maintained schools have to provide by law for the physical education of the pupils, and sometimes these facilities are also extended to the whole community for use out of school hours. +

 +

I'd like now to say a word or two about water-based sports. Activities on canals, rivers, lakes and reservoirs are becoming increasingly popular and for this we must thank the British Waterways Board, which as part of its work maintains 1760 km of cruising waterways for navigation, about 960 km of other waterways and some 90 reservoirs. +

 +

In addition to the facilities which are provided by local authorities, such as the sports centres and golf courses I mentioned earlier, we mustn't forget the local voluntary clubs such as rugby, cricket, tennis, golf and so on. Some clubs are even attached to local businesses and cater for the needs of a firm's employees, and in fact some companies are actively encouraging their staff to take advantage of the facilities provided. I've even heard of employees being given time off in the middle of the working day to do a little sport, a practice which is, I believe, already quite popular in the United States. +

 +

'A healthy mind in a healthy body', as the saying goes, so perhaps this is what is in the minds of these employers. This phrase of course applies very much to the young and, as I said before, all publicly maintained schools must by law provide for the physical education of their pupils. This covers gymnastics, team games, athletics, dancing and swimming. Every school, except those solely for infants, must have a playing field, or the use of one, and most secondary schools have their own gymnasium as well. Some have other amenities such as swimming pools, sports halls and halls designed for dance and movement. Sports and recreation facilities are likewise provided at universities, some of which have their own physical education departments, and there are also so-called 'centres of sporting excellence' at universities and other colleges enabling selected young athletes to develop their talents but which also provide for their educational needs.

英国人对体育运动的兴趣广泛存在，从大量观众观看在温布利体育场举行的足协杯决赛、在特威克纳姆、默里菲尔德或卡迪夫阿姆斯公园举行的国际橄榄球比赛、温布尔登草地网球锦标赛等活动中可以看出这一点。数百万人不仅通过电视观看这些比赛，而且整个国家积极参与体育和娱乐活动的热情也日益高涨。人们发现现在他们有更多的空闲时间，因此政府有责任提供机会和设施。除了专业方面之外，人们对业余运动的热情也日益高涨，这导致人们对攀岩、漫步、划船和其他水上运动以及健身、运动和舞蹈活动的兴趣与日俱增。


最受欢迎的观赏性运动可能是足球协会，它的历史可以追溯到十九世纪，由英格兰、威尔士、苏格兰和北爱尔兰各自的足球协会控制。英国足球协会 (English Football Association) 或英足总 (FA) 旗下有超过 400 个俱乐部，地区协会 (Regional Association) 则有约 37,000 个俱乐部。英格兰和威尔士的主要俱乐部属于足球联盟，共有92个俱乐部，而苏格兰的38个俱乐部属于苏格兰联赛。他们在英格兰的四个分区和苏格兰的三个分区进行比赛。足球赛季期间，观众总数约为 2700 万人。


地方当局提供设施以满足各种室内和室外活动的需要；其中包括高尔夫球场、游泳池和休闲中心等。去年，全国在体育和户外休闲方面的总支出远远超过 5 亿英镑。


当然，公立学校必须依法为学生提供体育教育，有时这些设施也扩展到整个社区供课外使用。


现在我想谈谈水上运动。运河、河流、湖泊和水库上的活动越来越受欢迎，为此我们必须感谢英国水道委员会，作为其工作的一部分，该委员会维护着 1760 公里的巡航水道、约 960 公里的其他水道和约 90 座水库。


除了当地政府提供的设施，例如我之前提到的体育中心和高尔夫球场之外，我们也不能忘记当地的志愿俱乐部，例如橄榄球、板球、网球、高尔夫等。有些俱乐部甚至附属于当地企业，以满足公司员工的需求，事实上，有些公司正在积极鼓励员工利用所提供的设施。我什至听说过员工在工作日中间休息去做一点运动，我相信这种做法在美国已经很流行了。


俗话说“健康的身体蕴藏着健康的思想”，也许这就是这些雇主的想法。这句话当然非常适用于年轻人，正如我之前所说，所有公立学校都必须依法为学生提供体育教育。其中包括体操、团队比赛、田径、舞蹈和游泳。每所学校，除了专门针对婴儿的学校外，都必须拥有或使用一个运动场，大多数中学也有自己的体育馆。有些还设有其他设施，例如游泳池、体育馆以及专为舞蹈和运动而设计的大厅。大学也提供体育和娱乐设施，其中一些大学有自己的体育系，大学和其他学院也有所谓的“卓越体育中心”，使选定的年轻运动员能够发展他们的才能，但也提供以满足他们的教育需求。

Chairperson: Good evening ladies and gentlemen. It's nice to see so many of you here. Well, I'd like to introduce our two guests this evening: Mr. Andrew Frobisher, who has spent many years in Malaysia in the 1950s and 60s and knows the country very well indeed. And, on my right, Dr. Harry Benson who's an agricultural economist. +

Benson: Good evening. +

Frobisher: Good evening. +

Chairperson: Well, erm ... the purpose of this evening is to find out more about that fascinating substance, rubber, and the effects that it has on that fascinating country, Malaysia. Erm erm ... I believe erm ... er Mr. Frobisher, erm ... that Malaysia is at the same time an extremely rich and rather poor country. Erm ... how is this possible? +

Frobisher: Yes, well, that's quite true, Monica. Malaysia's population is by now over 12 million, and er per head o ... on paper the citizens are richer than those of the UK. But ... +

Benson: But of course that wealth is not so evenly distributed. In fact in 1981, it was estimated that 37% of the population were below the poverty line ... +

Frobisher: Yeah, well ... whatever that means ... and anyway shouldn't it be, er, was below the poverty line. +

Benson: Yes, of course. Sorry, Andrew. +

Frobisher: Yes, well, erm ... as I was saying, er ... much of Malaysia's wealth is based on rubber. Now, I remember my planting days ... +

Benson: Yes, yes, yes yes you're quite right there Andrew. Rubber represents about 20% of the Gross National Product and 30% of export earnings. (Er yes I ...) This puts Malaysia in a very good position internationally since rubber is an example of what we might call a 'post-industrial industry'. +

Frobisher: Well, what do you what do you mean by that? I ... +

Chairperson: Er ... excuse me ... yes, what does that mean? +

Frobisher: What is a post-industrial erm ... society? +

Benson: Most manufacturing industries are based on fossil fuels, for example, coal and oil. Now, the problem is that these will not last forever. They are finite. Sooner or late they will run out! Now, rubber is a natural product. The energy source involved in its creation is sunlight. Now sunlight, we hope, will outlast coal and oil, and best of all, sunlight is free. So, it is much cheaper to produce natural rubber which as we all know comes from trees, than to use up all those fossil fuels, both as fuels and as raw materials, in making synthetic rubber in factories. Rubber is one of the world's strategic products, so you can see what a good position Malaysia is in, and it would help if she could produce more ... +

Chairperson: Er ... well, what stands in the way then? +

Frobisher: Ah. Well, well it's the way they go about cultivating it. You see, I remember in my day just after ... +

Benson: Yes, most people have this image of vast estates, centrally run, but that's just not the case, even if almost a quarter of the population is involved, one way and another, with the production of rubber ... +

Frobisher: Yeah well, that's if you count the families ... +

Nenson: Oh yes, yes, yes almost 3 million people are involved, but the picture is a very fragmented one. Do you realize that there are 2 million hectares of land under cultivation for rubber in Malaysia, but that 70% of this area is divided amongst small-holders — half a million of them — who between them produce 60% of the country's rubber? +

Frobisher: Well, there's nothing wrong with that i ... in terms of quality of life, though I remember (yes, quite right ...) just after the war there was ... +

Benson: Yes, quite right. But being a smallholder does present problems. For example, when it comes to replacing old trees — you'll know about this Andrew — and the average useful life of a rubber tree is about 30 years, (yes, yes,) this can cause financial problems for the small farmer. The problem is being tackled, however, by some very enlightened insurance schemes available to the small-holder which can give him help through the difficult years. After all, the new trees take some years to mature and start producing rubber. +

Frobisher: Yes, indeed they do. I ... I ... +

Benson: Look. I've got an overhead projection here, which I think will be useful to make the various problems and their solutions clearer to us all. +

Frobisher: Overhead projection. There wasn't anything wrong with the blackboard in my time, you know ... +

Benson: No, but this is clearer and neater and up-to-date. So, here you see a summary of the position of rubber in Malaysia's economy and here is the first problem, and the solution that has been found through these insurance schemes. +

Chairperson: Hm, yes, I see. That's really very clear. +

Benson: Now for the second and really major problem. +

Frobisher: And may I ask what that is? +

Benson: Boredom and fatigue. +

Frobisher: Boredom and fatigue? What? +

Chairperson: What do you mean by that? +

Benson: Well, as with so many societies, the young people are leaving the land for the cities, leaving no one behind to carry on their parents' business. The root cause seems to be simply, boredom. Rubber is just not that entertaining a product to be involved with. It is labour-intensive in the extreme. Each tree on a plantation has to be tapped, by hand, every other day. +

Chairperson: Tapped? +

Benson: Yes. +

Forbisher: Yes, well, we ... +

Benson: Yes. The trunk is cut and the latex that comes out is collected in a cup. This is collected on the next day. 400 trees per day is the average figure per worker, which means 800 trees under the care of each worker, ten hours a day. Now, as I said previously, the main problem is that of the boredom. The work is not only hard, it is also mind-blowingly tedious.

主席：女士们先生们晚上好。很高兴在这里见到这么多人。那么，我想介绍今晚的两位嘉宾：Andrew Frobisher 先生，他在 20 世纪 50 年代和 60 年代的马来西亚生活了很多年，对这个国家非常了解。在我右边的是农业经济学家哈里·本森博士。
  本森：晚上好。

弗罗比舍：晚上好。

主席：嗯，嗯……今晚的目的是更多地了解橡胶这种迷人的物质，以及它对马来西亚这个迷人的国家的影响。呃呃…​我相信呃…​呃弗罗比舍先生，呃…​马来西亚同时是一个极其富裕而又相当贫穷的国家。呃……​这怎么可能？

弗罗比舍：是的，嗯，确实如此，莫妮卡。马来西亚的人口目前已超过 1200 万，呃，按人均计算，公民比英国人还要富有。但是……​

本森：当然，财富的分配并不是那么均匀。事实上，在 1981 年，据估计 37% 的人口生活在贫困线以下……​

弗罗比舍：是的，嗯……无论这意味着什么……无论如何，不​​应该是，呃，低于贫困线。

本森：是的，当然。对不起，安德鲁。

弗罗比舍：是的，嗯……正如我所说，呃……马来西亚的大部分财富都基于橡胶。现在，我记得我的种植日子......​

本森：是的，是的，是的，你说得很对，安德鲁。橡胶约占国民生产总值的20%和出口收入的30%。 （呃，是的，我……​）这使马来西亚在国际上处于非常有利的地位，因为橡胶是我们所谓的“后工业产业”的一个例子。

弗罗比舍：嗯，你这是什么意思？我……​

主席：呃……请问……是的，这是什么意思？

弗罗比舍：什么是后工业社会？

本森：大多数制造业都以化石燃料为基础，例如煤炭和石油。现在的问题是，这些不会永远持续下去。它们是有限的。迟早他们会用完的！现在，橡胶是一种天然产品。它的创造所涉及的能源是阳光。现在，我们希望阳光比煤炭和石油更持久，而且最重要的是，阳光是免费的。因此，生产天然橡胶（众所周知，天然橡胶来自树木）比在工厂生产合成橡胶时使用所有这些化石燃料（既作为燃料又作为原材料）要便宜得多。橡胶是世界战略产品之一，所以你可以看到马来西亚处于多么有利的地位，如果她能够生产更多......​

主席：呃……那么，到底是什么阻碍了呢？

弗罗比舍：啊。好吧，这就是他们培养它的方式。你看，我记得那天之后……​

本森：是的，大多数人都有这样的印象：巨大的庄园，集中管理，但事实并非如此，即使近四分之一的人口以某种方式参与橡胶生产……​

弗罗比舍：是的，如果你算上家庭的话……​

Nenson：哦，是的，是的，是的，几乎有 300 万人参与其中，但情况非常分散。您是否意识到马来西亚有 200 万公顷的橡胶土地，但其中 70% 的土地都属于小农（其中有 50 万），他们生产了该国 60% 的橡胶？

弗罗比舍：嗯，就生活质量而言，我……没有任何问题，尽管我记得（是的，完全正确……）战后不久就有……​

本森：是的，完全正确。但作为小农确实存在问题。例如，当谈到更换老树时——你会知道这个安德鲁——橡胶树的平均使用寿命约为 30 年，（是的，是的，）这可能会给小农带来经济问题。然而，这个问题正在通过一些非常开明的保险计划得到解决，这些计划可以帮助小农户度过困难的岁月。毕竟，新树需要几年的时间才能成熟并开始生产橡胶。

弗罗比舍：是的，确实如此。我……​我……​

本森：看。我这里有一个俯视图，我认为这有助于让我们所有人更清楚地了解各种问题及其解决方案。

弗罗比舍：头顶投影。在我那个时代，黑板没有任何问题，你知道……​

Benson：不，但是这样更清晰、更简洁并且是最新的。因此，在这里您可以看到橡胶在马来西亚经济中的地位的摘要，这是第一个问题，以及通过这些保险计划找到的解决方案。

主席：嗯，是的，我明白了。这真的非常清楚。

本森：现在来谈谈第二个也是非常主要的问题。

弗罗比舍：我可以问那是什么吗？

本森：无聊和疲劳。

弗罗比舍：无聊和疲劳？什么？

主席：您这话是什么意思？

本森：嗯，就像许多社会一样，年轻人正在离开土地前往城市，没有人留下来继承父母的生意。根本原因似乎很简单，就是无聊。橡胶并不是一种令人感兴趣的产品。这是极端的劳动密集型。种植园里的每棵树都必须每隔一天手工采割一次。
  主席：被攻破了？
  本森：是的。

福尔比舍：是的，好吧，我们……​

本森：是的。树干被切开，流出的乳胶被收集在杯子里。这是第二天收集的。平均每个工人每天 400 棵树，这意味着每个工人每天 10 个小时照顾 800 棵树。现在，正如我之前所说，主要问题是无聊。这项工作不仅辛苦，而且还极其乏味。

Frobisher: So, ha ... have you got any suggestions to make things more interesting for them? +

Benson: Well, not so much me, but the Malaysians are doing some very good work in this field. One idea is to make the work on the plantations more varied, and profitable, by introducing other products which are compatible with continuing to grow rubber trees. +

Chairperson: Yes for example? +

Benson: Well, the most promising line seems to be to encourage small-holders to raise livestock which can live amongst the trees. +

Frobisher: Yes, yes, I, I hear they've started trying raising chickens and turkeys. +

Benson: Yes, yes, indeed. I have another OHP at this point. +

Frobisher: Erm ... OHP? +

Benson: Overhead projection ... +

Frobisher: Ah. +

Benson: Anyway, you can see here the different types of animals that have been tried. At first sight, chickens seemed ideal. After all, they did originate as jungle birds. However, hmm excuse me, so far the profits on chickens have proved disappointing. The turkey seemed an excellent choice, since it could live amongst the tress living very well off the seeds of the rubber trees, which lie scattered all over the forest floors and are put to no other use ... +

Frobisher: Yes, yes ... but, but the turkey, it's hardly an established part of the Malaysian diet! +

Benson: Exactly! So far the most successful candidate has been the sheep. +

Frobisher: Sheep? +

Benson: Now ... Sheep. Sheep will eat the weeds, which will save the cultivator money and work, and they are a source of meat which is acceptable both to Hindus and Muslims. +

Frobisher: Yes, well, that's most important in multicultural Malaysia. +

Benson: Yes, yes, and of course they can also be used for their milk, their wool and their skins. +

Frobisher: Yes, of course ... Mmm. +

Benson: And now, as you can see on my OHP ... +

Chairperson: Well, erm ... thank you both very very much to both our guests ... +

 +

Well, what lies ahead for Malaysia? Can her researchers and scientists continue to find ways of increasing the rubber yield? Can the labor-intensive and tedious life of the rubber plantation be made interesting and varied enough to capture the young people's interest and stop the migration to the cities? Well, I'm sure we've all enjoyed and learned a lot from huh what both our guests have had to say. Huh we look forward to the next meeting in the series 'Other lands, other problems' which will be on Monday next. That's at 8:15 and do please come on time. +

Frobisher: Hmm. Pushy bastard.

弗罗比舍：所以，哈……你有什么建议可以让他们的事情变得更有趣吗？

本森：嗯，不是我，而是马来西亚人在这个领域做了一些非常好的工作。一种想法是通过引入与继续种植橡胶树相兼容的其他产品，使种植园的工作更加多样化、更加有利可图。

主席：例如是吗？

本森：嗯，最有希望的路线似乎是鼓励小农饲养可以生活在树林中的牲畜。

弗罗比舍：是的，是的，我，我听说他们已经开始尝试饲养鸡和火鸡了。

本森：是的，是的，确实如此。此时我还有另一个 OHP。

弗罗比舍：呃……​OHP？

本森：头顶投影……​
  弗罗比舍：啊。

本森：无论如何，你可以在这里看到已经尝试过的不同类型的动物。乍一看，鸡似乎很理想。毕竟，它们确实起源于丛林鸟类。然而，抱歉，到目前为止，鸡肉的利润令人失望。火鸡似乎是一个很好的选择，因为它可以生活在以橡胶树种子为食的树木中，这些种子散布在整个森林地面上，没有其他用途……​

弗罗比舍：是的，是的……​但是，但是火鸡，它几乎不是马来西亚饮食的既定部分！

本森：没错！到目前为止，最成功的候选人是羊。
  弗罗比舍：羊？

本森：现在……羊。羊会吃杂草，这将为耕种者节省金钱和工作，而且它们是印度教徒和穆斯林都可以接受的肉类来源。

弗罗比舍：是的，这对于多元文化的马来西亚来说是最重要的。

本森：是的，是的，当然它们也可以用来生产牛奶、羊毛和毛皮。

弗罗比舍：是的，当然……嗯。

本森：现在，正如你在我的 OHP 上看到的那样……​

主席：嗯，嗯……非常感谢我们的两位嘉宾……​


那么，马来西亚的未来是什么？她的研究人员和科学家能否继续寻找提高橡胶产量的方法？橡胶园劳动密集、乏味的生活能否变得有趣、丰富多彩，以吸引年轻人的兴趣并阻止他们向城市迁移？嗯，我相信我们都喜欢并从我们两位客人所说的话中学到了很多东西。嗯，我们期待下周一举行的“其他土地，其他问题”系列的下一次会议。现在是 8 点 15 分，请准时来。

弗罗比舍：嗯。咄咄逼人的混蛋。

Some of the Problems Facing Learners of English +

 +

Today I'd like to talk about some of the problems that students face when they follow a course of study through the medium of English — if English is not their mother tongue. The purpose is to show that we're aware of students' problems, and that by analysing them perhaps it'll be possible to suggest how some of them may be overcome. +

 +

The problems can be divided into three broad categories: psychological, cultural and linguistic. The first two categories mainly concern those who come to study in Britain. I'll comment only briefly on these first two and then spend most of the time looking at linguistic difficulties which apply to everyone wherever they are learning English. Some of the common psychological problems really involve fear of the unknown: for example, whether one's academic studies will be too difficult, whether one will fail the examinations, etc. All students share these apprehensions. It's probably best for a student not to look too far ahead but to concentrate day-by-day on increasing his knowledge and developing his ability. The overseas student in Britain may also suffer from separation from his family and possible homesickness; enjoyment of his activities in Britain and the passage of time are the only real help here. +

 +

Looking now at the cultural problems, we can see that some of them are of a very practical nature, e.g. arranging satisfactory accommodation: getting used to British money (or the lack of it!). British food and weather (neither is always bad!). Some of the cultural difficulties are less easy to define: they are bound up with the whole range of alien customs, habits and traditions — in other words, the British way of life. Such difficulties include: settling into a strange environment and a new academic routine; learning a new set of social habits, ranging from the times of meals to the meanings of gestures; expressing appropriate greetings; understanding a different kind of humour; and learning how to make friends. Being open-minded and adaptable is the best approach to some of the difficulties listed here. +

 +

The largest category is probably linguistic. Let's look at this in some detail. +

 +

Most students will have learnt English at school, but if they've already been to college or university in their own countries they'll have studied mostly in their own language except, perhaps, for reading some textbooks and journals in English. In other words, they'll have had little everyday opportunity to practise using English. +

 +

When foreign learners first have the opportunity to speak to an English-speaking person they may have a shock: they often have great difficulty in understanding! There are a number of reasons for this. I'll just mention three of them. +

 +

Firstly, it seems to students that English people speak very quickly. Secondly, they speak with a variety of accents. Thirdly, different styles of speech are used in different situations, e.g. everyday spoken English, which is colloquial and idiomatic, is different from the English used for academic purposes. For all of these reasons students will have difficulty, mainly because they lack practice in listening to English people speaking English. Don't forget, by the way, that if students have difficulty in understanding English-speaking people, these people may also have difficulty in understanding the students! +

 +

What can a student do then to overcome these difficulties? Well, obviously, he can benefit from attending English classes and if a language laboratory is available use it as much as possible. He should also listen to programmes in English on the radio and TV. Perhaps most important of all, he should take every available opportunity to meet and speak with native English-speaking people. He should be aware, however, that English people are, by temperament, often reserved and may be unwilling to start a conversation. Nevertheless, if he has the courage to take the initiative, however difficult it may seem to be, most English people will respond. He will need patience and perseverance! +

 +

In addition to these problems regarding listening and understanding, the student probably has difficulty in speaking English fluently. He has the ideas, he knows what to say (in his own language) but he doesn't know how to say it in English. The advice here will seem difficult to follow but it's necessary. Firstly, he must simplify his language so that he can express himself reasonably clearly: for example, short sentences will be better than long ones. Secondly, he must try to think in English, not translate from his mother tongue. This'll only begin to take place when his use of English becomes automatic: using a language laboratory and listening to as much English as possible will help. In general, he should practise speaking as much as possible. He should also notice the kind of English, and its structure, that educated people use, and try to imitate it.

英语学习者面临的一些问题


今天我想谈谈学生在通过英语学习课程时面临的一些问题——如果英语不是他们的母语的话。目的是表明我们意识到学生的问题，并且通过分析这些问题也许可以提出如何克服其中一些问题的建议。


这些问题可以分为三大类：心理、文化和语言。前两类主要涉及来英国留学的人。我将仅简要评论前两个，然后花大部分时间研究语言困难，这些困难适用于每个人，无论他们在哪里学习英语。一些常见的心理问题确实涉及到对未知的恐惧：比如学业会不会太难，考试会不会不及格等等，这些担忧是所有学生都有的。对于学生来说，最好不要看得太远，而是每天集中精力增加知识和发展能力。在英国的留学生也可能会遭受与家人分离和可能的思乡之苦；享受他在英国的活动和时间的流逝是这里唯一真正的帮助。


现在看看文化问题，我们可以看到其中一些问题是非常实际的，例如：安排满意的住宿：习惯英国的金钱（或缺乏它！）。英国的食物和天气（两者都不总是坏的！）。有些文化困难不太容易定义：它们与各种外来风俗、习惯和传统——换句话说，就是英国的生活方式——息息相关。这些困难包括：适应陌生的环境和新的学习习惯；学习一套新的社交习惯，从进餐时间到手势含义；表达适当的问候；理解不同类型的幽默；并学习如何交朋友。思想开放和适应能力强是解决此处列出的一些困难的最佳方法。


最大的类别可能是语言方面的。让我们详细看看这个。


大多数学生会在学校学习英语，但如果他们已经在自己的国家上过学院或大学，那么除了阅读一些英语教科书和期刊之外，他们大部分都会用自己的语言学习。换句话说，他们每天几乎没有机会练习使用英语。


当外国学习者第一次有机会与说英语的人交谈时，他们可能会感到震惊：他们常常很难理解！有许多的原因。我只提其中三个。


首先，在学生看来，英国人说得很快。其次，他们说话有多种口音。第三，不同的场合使用不同的言语风格，例如：日常口语英语是口语和地道的，与学术用途的英语不同。由于所有这些原因，学生会遇到困难，主要是因为他们缺乏听英国人说英语的练习。顺便说一句，不要忘记，如果学生很难理解说英语的人，那么这些人也可能很难理解学生！


那么学生可以做什么来克服这些困难呢？嗯，显然，他可以从参加英语课程中受益，如果有语言实验室，请尽可能使用它。他还应该听广播和电视上的英语节目。也许最重要的是，他应该利用一切可能的机会与以英语为母语的人会面并交谈。然而，他应该意识到，英国人的性格往往比较保守，可能不愿意开始对话。然而，如果他有勇气采取主动，无论看起来多么困难，大多数英国人都会做出回应。他需要耐心和毅力！


除了听力和理解方面的问题外，学生可能在流利地说英语方面也存在困难。他有想法，他知道该说什么（用他自己的语言），但他不知道如何用英语说。这里的建议似乎很难遵循，但却是必要的。首先，他必须简化他的语言，以便他能够合理清晰地表达自己的意思：例如，短句会比长句更好。其次，他必须尝试用英语思考，而不是用母语翻译。只有当他自动使用英语时，这才会开始发生：使用语言实验室并尽可能多地听英语会有帮助。一般来说，他应该尽可能多地练习口语。他还应该注意受过教育的人使用的英语类型及其结构，并尝试模仿它。
