Lesson 36 +

== part


Just before I give a few details about the — er — fun aspect of computers that is, for use at home and for entertainment — I'd like to mention a couple of facts about the outlook for ISDN — that's the integrated services digital network — and it foresees a world-wide telecommunications network which could transmit telex and voice signals and, indeed, full-colour video images and high-speed computer data. Now, can you just imagine having a meeting with your colleagues around the world without even leaving your office? Well, that's what world-wide video teleconferencing can do, and it's on the cards that internal toll-free telephones may be available and also faster computer transmission with a digital network. And how are all these marvellous things achieved? Well, there are satellite relays, and digital packet switching, and laser devices which transmit over fibre-optic cables. But more about that another time. +
 +
And after that slight diversion I'll get back to a totally different aspect of modern technology — home computers, or PCs — that stands for personal computers. First, a bit of background. Some people attribute this growth industry to the recession which led to redundancies and a shorter working week, and this in turn led to more leisure time. So what are people doing with this extra free time that's on their hands? They're indulging in home entertainment, that's what! Hundreds of companies have sprung up to fill this gap, and the sports, DIY and home entertainment industries are achieving phenomenal success. In 1983 in the US, there were four million PCs, and game-playing was the principal use, with educational use a close second; and in third place was the financial function for things like budgeting, balancing cheque books, accounting and forecasting and so on. +
 +
To illustrate this with a few concrete figures, from the States again, in 1983, 52 per cent of the software was for entertainment programs, whereas only 16 percent was educational. Possibly this could be explained by the short life span of computer games, and having teenagers in the home was a decisive factor in the purchase of a personal computer, as households with children in this age-range were 50 per cent more likely to buy them. As far as the interest versus disapproval statistics go, in the 18-19 age-group, 25 per cent expressed interest in PCs and 18 per cent disapproval; and at the other end of the scale, the over-60s showed only 3 per cent interest and a resounding 87 per cent disapproval! +
 +
And this trend towards PCs is likely to continue as users become more knowledgeable and want more expensive machines with all kinds of new things. And there's a wide range in sizes, too, as the portable market expands, and now you can buy a featherweight lap-size model that's less than 2 kg, or something larger at around 12 kg but still portable. Just to digress slightly, I'd like to point out that microtechnology has hit other aspects of the home and leisure industry as well. With more time on our hands it seems we're spending more time keeping fit, and fitness has become a real growth industry, and it seems prone to gadgetry as well! There are all sorts of new things on the market these days. Take, for example, the watches that monitor your pulse rate as you jog or do aerobics, or exercise bicycles with sensors in the handgrips to check your pulse rate and then display it on a screen. And for those of you who remember that famous toy of the early 80s — Rubik's cube, the one with six sides, each composed of nine rotating faces, with 43 quintillion combinations — well, anyway, in a lab in the US they're working on a Cubot — that's a self-contained robot using microprocessors and mechanics — to solve it. But I'm getting off the track again, so back to our home computers with a final warning. +
 +
The technical innovations of the last couple of decades have led to a host of new words in our vocabulary, and one of these is hacker — that's H-A-C-K-E-R — and it simply means an enthusiast who breaks into computers. And, not so long ago in the States, teenagers who were hackers used their home computers to break into supposedly secure government and business computers, for example in banks, labs and research centres. They just tried out different passwords until they found the right one. And as one seventeen-year-old said, 'It was like child's play.' And all that's needed is a home computer and a modem — that's M-O-D-E-M — which is a device that allows computers to transmit data over the phone lines — and, of course, a basic knowledge of how to operate a computer! And this has led to tangled legal and ethical problems — but we won't go into that here. But, as you can see, home computers are indeed a handy thing to have around, not only for entertainment but also for educational value. And no doubt in future ...

就在我详细介绍计算机的——呃——有趣的方面，即用于家庭和娱乐的方面——我想提一下有关 ISDN 前景的几个事实——即综合服务数字网络——它还预见了一个世界范围的电信网络，可以传输电传和语音信号，甚至可以传输全彩色视频图像和高速计算机数据。现在，您能想象足不出户就能与世界各地的同事开会吗？嗯，这就是全球视频电话会议可以做到的，并且可以使用内部免费电话以及通过数字网络进行更快的计算机传输。所有这些奇妙的事情是如何实现的？嗯，有卫星中继、数字分组交换和通过光纤电缆传输的激光设备。但稍后再详细讨论。


在这个小小的转移之后，我将回到现代技术的一个完全不同的方面——家用电脑，或个人电脑——代表个人电脑。首先，介绍一些背景知识。一些人将这一行业的增长归因于经济衰退，经济衰退导致裁员和每周工作时间缩短，而这反过来又带来了更多的休闲时间。那么人们利用这些额外的空闲时间做什么呢？他们沉迷于家庭娱乐，就是这样！数百家公司如雨后春笋般涌现，填补了这一空白，体育、DIY 和家庭娱乐行业正在取得惊人的成功。 1983年，美国有400万台个人电脑，玩游戏是主要用途，教育用途紧随其后；第三位是财务职能，例如预算、平衡支票簿、会计和预测等。


用一些具体的数字来说明这一点，还是从美国来看，1983 年，52% 的软件是用于娱乐程序，而只有 16% 是教育程序。这可能是因为电脑游戏的生命周期较短，而家里有青少年是购买个人电脑的决定性因素，因为有这个年龄段孩子的家庭购买电脑的可能性要高出 50% 。就兴趣与反对统计数据而言，在 18-19 岁年龄组中，25% 的人表示对 PC 感兴趣，18% 的人表示反对；而在天平的另一端，60 岁以上的人只表现出 3% 的兴趣，而 87% 的人强烈反对！


随着用户变得更加了解并想要拥有各种新事物的更昂贵的机器，这种个人电脑的趋势可能会持续下去。随着便携式市场的扩大，尺寸也有很大的变化，现在您可以购买重量小于 2 公斤的轻量级膝上型型号，或者更大的型号（约 12 公斤但仍可携带）。稍微离题一下，我想指出微技术也影响了家居和休闲行业的其他方面。随着我们手上的时间越来越多，我们似乎花更多的时间来保持健康，健身已经成为一个真正的增长行业，而且它似乎也很容易受到小玩意的影响！如今市场上有各种各样的新事物。例如，在慢跑或做有氧运动时监测您的脉搏率的手表，或者在手柄中装有传感器的健身自行车来检查您的脉搏率，然后将其显示在屏幕上。对于那些还记得 80 年代初那个著名玩具的人来说——魔方，有六个面，每个面由九个旋转面组成，有 43 千万种组合——好吧，无论如何，他们正在美国的一个实验室里工作在 Cubot 上——这是一个使用微处理器和机械装置的独立机器人——来解决这个问题。但我又偏离了轨道，所以回到我们的家用电脑并发出最后的警告。


过去几十年的技术创新在我们的词汇中产生了许多新词，其中之一就是黑客，即 H-A-C-K-E-R，它的意思只是闯入计算机的爱好者。而且，不久前在美国，青少年黑客利用他们的家用计算机闯入了所谓安全的政府和商业计算机，例如银行、实验室和研究中心的计算机。他们只是尝试不同的密码，直到找到正确的密码。正如一位 17 岁的年轻人所说：“这就像儿戏一样。”所需要的只是一台家用电脑和一个调制解调器 - 这就是 M-O-D-E-M - 这是一种允许计算机通过电话线传输数据的设备 - 当然，还需要了解如何操作计算机的基本知识！这导致了错综复杂的法律和道德问题——但我们不会在这里讨论这个问题。但是，正如您所看到的，家用计算机确实是一个方便携带的东西，不仅具有娱乐性，而且具有教育价值。毫无疑问，未来……​

Dade County, Florida, which includes the city of Miami, is a dangerous place to be these days, that according to a Miami Herald poll released this week. The survey reports that forty-two percent of people interviewed or their family members have been victims of burglary, robbery or assault in the past five years. Almost one half say they need guns to feel safe in Dade County, although most people won't say whether they do own weapons. The Herald conducted the survey in the wake of a widely publicized booby trap killing, in which a store owner killed a would-be burglar. And now the poll suggests a lot more people want to take law into their own hands. Herald reporter Andre Vicluchee has been covering the story. +
 +
"The one part I think that that was a little surprising was the number of people who feel that it is okay to shoot, to kill an intruder that comes into your house. We found sixty-three percent feel that they should have the right to kill an intruder in their house." +
 +
"Whether or not the person is armed or not only if ..." +
 +
"Whether they know or not if the person is armed. It surprised us; we figured there would be something of a hard-line attitude out there. But this was probably above what we expected." +
 +
"Well, it seems, though, that people are perceiving at least in Dade County that crimes are really in bad situation that they are willing to do something about it with violence." +
 +
"Yes. I went back and questioned more at length another fifteen or twenty responded from the poll. And they all seem to feel that, if they find themselves in a situation in which they have to take some action, even if it means killing somebody, they'll do it." +
 +
"I'll take it that Miami Herald poll and perhaps that a lot of people's feelings about crimes stem in part from this case of the booby trap victim, a store owner booby trapped his variety store raider in a black neighborhood. Tell us about that case." +
 +
"The man's name is Prentice Raschid. He is a black business man who has a small store in a black high-crime area of town. He has been burglarized, I think, seven or eight times over the past few weeks, had asked for help from the police and had not gotton any answer to his satisfaction. So he went ahead and set up an electrical booby trap in the store. About a week and a half ago one morning, they found a young man dead in the booby trap who had been electrocuted while trying to carry out some stuff from the store." +
 +
"In what has the public reaction been then?" +
 +
"The public reaction has been an overwhelming support for Mr Raschid. He has been charged with man slaughter, and with setting up an illegal man trap. But our poll found that seventy-nine percent of the population here feel he should not be prosecuted." +
 +
"Has this case, this booby trap case, led to inspire any other similar instances of citizen store-owners fighting back against burglars?" +
 +
"I don't know if it directly inspired them, but it may have been a coincidence. But in the following week there were another five incidents in which citizens, if you will, turn the tables on assailants. In fact these all six incidents left four people dead, four alleged criminals dead and two others wounded in the hospital." +
 +
"Is there anything about Dade County that is making it a particularly blood thirsty place at the moment, as crime's really on the increase in Dade County . . ." +
 +
"I believe the situation is, we have a city here that has grown a lot in the last few years." +
 +
"In what way? What's been the source of the growth?" +
 +
"Immigration for the most part, and lot of people coming in from Cuba, Cuban refugees, a lot of Haitian refugees, and from all over Latin America. What is interesting about the Raschid case in this context is that, as Mr Raschid has pointed out himself, that although he is a black business man operating in a black area, his support has come from all groups, Hispanic, white and black." +
 +
"Andre, do you carry around a gun when you are doing your reporting?" +
 +
"I don't. But I know some reporters that do." +
 +
Andre Vigluche is a reporter for the Miami Herald.


根据迈阿密先驱报本周发布的一项民意调查，包括迈阿密市在内的佛罗里达州戴德县如今是一个危险的地方。调查报告称，42% 的受访者或其家人在过去五年中遭受过入室盗窃、抢劫或袭击。近一半的人表示，他们需要枪支才能在戴德县感到安全，尽管大多数人不会透露他们是否拥有武器。 《先驱报》在一场广为人知的诱杀装置杀人事件后进行了这项调查，其中一名商店老板杀死了一名潜在的窃贼。现在的民意调查显示，更多的人希望将法律掌握在自己手中。 《先驱报》记者安德烈·维克鲁奇一直在报道此事。


“我认为有点令人惊讶的是，有多少人认为开枪杀死进入你家的入侵者是可以的。我们发现百分之六十三的人认为他们应该有权杀死闯入他们房子的入侵者。”


“无论这个人是否携带武器，只要......”


“无论他们是否知道这个人是否携带武器。这让我们感到惊讶；我们认为那里会有强硬态度。但这可能超出了我们的预期。”


“嗯，不过，至少在戴德县，人们似乎意识到犯罪情况确实很糟糕，他们愿意用暴力来解决这个问题。”


“是的。我回去详细询问了另外十五或二十人的民意调查结果。他们似乎都觉得，如果他们发现自己处于必须采取某种行动的情况，即使这意味着杀人，他们会做到的。”


“我认为《迈阿密先驱报》的民意调查，也许很多人对犯罪的看法部分源于这起诱杀装置受害者的案件，一名商店老板在一个黑人社区将他的杂货店袭击者诱入陷阱。告诉我们这件事吧。案件。”


“这个人的名字叫普伦蒂斯·拉希德（Prentice Raschid）。他是一名黑人商人，在该镇黑人犯罪率高的地区拥有一家小商店。我想，在过去的几周里，他被盗窃了七八次，他要求警方寻求帮助，但没有得到令他满意的答复。于是他继续在店里设置了一个电子诱杀装置。大约一周半前的一天早上，他们发现一名年轻人死在了诱杀装置中。在试图从商店取出一些东西时触电身亡。”


“当时公众的反应是什么？”


“公众的反应是对拉希德先生的压倒性支持。他被指控犯有屠杀罪和设置非法人员陷阱。但我们的民意调查发现，这里百分之七十九的人认为他不应该受到起诉。 ”


“这个案件，这个诱杀装置案件，是否引发了任何其他类似的公民店主反击窃贼的事件？”


“我不知道这是否直接启发了他们，但这可能是一个巧合。但在接下来的一周里，又发生了五起事件，如果你愿意的话，公民们扭转了袭击者的局面。事实上，这所有六起事件造成四人死亡，四名犯罪嫌疑人死亡，另外两人在医院受伤。”


“戴德县目前是否有什么因素使其成为一个特别嗜血的地方，因为戴德县的犯罪确实在增加……”


“我相信情况是，我们这里的城市在过去几年里发展了很多。”


“以什么方式？增长的源泉是什么？”


“大部分是移民，很多人来自古巴、古巴难民、很多海地难民以及整个拉丁美洲。在这种背景下，拉希德案件的有趣之处在于，正如拉希德先生所指出的那样他自己表示，虽然他是一名在黑人地区经营的黑人商人，但他的支持来自所有群体，包括西班牙裔、白人和黑人。”


“安德烈，你做报道的时候带枪吗？”


“我不知道。但我知道有些记者是这样的。”


安德烈·维格鲁什 (Andre Vigluche) 是《迈阿密先驱报》的记者。

== Technology and the Future (III) +

Now I would like to discuss environment, which is very much a function of transportation and communication. But it is also a function of population. As everybody knows, we are now in a population explosion — but probably around the turn of the century this particular explosion will be controlled and the world population may be shrinking again. +
 +
Nevertheless, even with a six billion population there may be more room than is generally imagined today. By the twenty-first century, agriculture will be on the way out. It's a ridiculous process: a whole acre is needed to feed one person, because growing plants are extremely inefficient devices for trapping sunlight. If we could develop a biological system working at a mere five per cent efficiency — today's solar cells can double that — it would require twenty square feet, not one acre, to feed one person. +
 +
Food production is the last major industry to yield to technology. Only now are we doing something about it, probably too little and too late. +
 +
One promising field of research is the production of proteins from petroleum by microbiological conversion, which sounds most unappetizing — but we do use microbes to make wine. This process gives high-quality proteins, some of them better balanced for human consumption than natural vegetable proteins. It would take only three per cent of today's petroleum output to provide the total protein needs of the entire human race. +
 +
With the exception of luxury items — and the Russians, I've heard, have already started to export synthetic caviare — most foods will be factory-made in the next century. This will free vast areas of agricultural land for other purposes — living, parks, recreation, hunting — above all, for wilderness. +
 +
As a source of raw materials, the sea seems inexhaustible. Any element you care to mention is there, in solution or lying on the seabed. We will also be forced to use it for more and more of our water supply, through desalination techniques. +
 +
I'm sorry to leave the sea so hastily, but space is a lot bigger and I must spend more time on that. +
 +
Our current ideas of space and its potentialities are badly distorted by the primitive nature of our techniques. To prove this, here is a statistic that will surprise you. +
 +
The amount of energy needed to lift a man to the Moon is about 1,000 kilowatt-hours and that costs only ten to twenty dollars! The difference of nine zeros between this and the Apollo budget is a measure of our present incompetence. Ultimately, there's no reason why space travel should be, in terms of future incomes, much more expensive than jet flight today. +
 +
Space communities will be established first on the Moon, then on Mars, and later on other worlds. But much closer to the Earth, orbital space stations of many kinds will be in wide use by the year 2000. In May 1967, I was in Dallas to attend the first conference on the commercial uses of space — including tourism. Barron Hilton gave a talk on the Hilton Orbiter Hotel, which he hopes to see in his lifetime. Space tourism is going to be a major industry in the twenty-first century. +
 +
Another tremendously important use of space stations will be for medical research. One paper given at Dallas discussed the engineering problem of a hospital in orbit. +
 +
Which brings a poignant memory to mind. The last letter I ever received from that great scientist professor J B S Haldane was written when he was dying of cancer and in considerable pain from his operations. In it, he said what a boon the weightless environment of a space hospital would be to patients like himself not to mention burn victims, sufferers from heart complaints, and those afflicted with muscle diseases. I am convinced that research in space will open up unguessed regions of medical knowledge and give us a vast range of new therapies. So I get pretty mad when I hear ignorant but well-intentioned people ask, 'Why not spend the space budget on something useful — like cancer research?' When we do find a cancer cure, part of the basic knowledge will have come from space. And ultimately we will find even more important secrets there: perhaps, some day, a cure for death itself ...

科技与未来（三）
现在我想讨论一下环境，它在很大程度上是交通和通讯的功能。但这也是人口的函数。众所周知，我们现在正处于人口爆炸之中——但可能在世纪之交，这种特殊的爆炸将得到控制，世界人口可能会再次萎缩。


然而，即使有 60 亿人口，空间也可能比今天普遍想象的要大。到二十一世纪，农业将走向灭亡。这是一个荒谬的过程：需要一英亩的土地才能养活一个人，因为种植植物吸收阳光的效率极低。如果我们能够开发出一种效率仅为 5% 的生物系统（今天的太阳能电池可以将其提高一倍），那么就需要 20 平方英尺（而不是一英亩）来养活一个人。


食品生产是最后一个屈服于技术的主要行业。直到现在我们才开始采取行动，但可能力度太小而且太晚了。


一个有前途的研究领域是通过微生物转化从石油中生产蛋白质，这听起来最令人倒胃口——但我们确实使用微生物来酿酒。这个过程产生了高质量的蛋白质，其中一些蛋白质比天然植物蛋白更适合人类食用。只需要当今石油产量的百分之三就能满足全人类的蛋白质总需求。


除了奢侈品之外——据我所知，俄罗斯人已经开始出口合成鱼子酱——大多数食品将在下个世纪实现工厂化生产。这将释放大片农田用于其他目的——生活、公园、娱乐、狩猎——最重要的是，用于荒野。


作为原材料的来源，海洋似乎取之不尽，用之不竭。你想提到的任何元素都在那里，在溶液中或躺在海底。我们还将被迫通过海水淡化技术将其用于越来越多的供水。


很抱歉这么匆忙地离开大海，但是太空更大，我必须花更多时间在上面。


我们当前对空间及其潜力的看法因我们技术的原始性质而严重扭曲。为了证明这一点，这里有一个会让你大吃一惊的统计数据。


将人送上月球所需的能量约为 1,000 千瓦时，而成本仅为十到二十美元！这个预算与阿波罗预算之间九个零的差异是我们目前无能的衡量标准。最终，就未来收入而言，太空旅行没有理由比今天的喷气式飞机昂贵得多。


太空社区将首先在月球上建立，然后在火星上，然后在其他星球上建立。但到 2000 年，距离地球更近的多种轨道空间站将得到广泛使用。 1967 年 5 月，我在达拉斯参加了第一届关于太空商业用途（包括旅游业）的会议。巴伦·希尔顿 (Barron Hilton) 发表了关于他希望在有生之年亲眼目睹的希尔顿轨道飞行器酒店 (Hilton Orbiter Hotel) 的演讲。太空旅游将成为二十一世纪的主要产业。


空间站的另一个极其重要的用途是用于医学研究。达拉斯发表的一篇论文讨论了轨道医院的工程问题。


这让我想起一段令人心酸的回忆。我从伟大的科学家 J B S Haldane 教授那里收到的最后一封信是在他因癌症和手术带来的巨大痛苦而濒临死亡时写的。他在文中表示，太空医院的失重环境对于像他这样的患者来说是多么大的福音，更不用说烧伤患者、心脏病患者和肌肉疾病患者了。我相信太空研究将开辟未知的医学知识领域，并为我们提供大量新疗法。因此，当我听到无知但善意的人问“为什么不把空间预算花在有用的事情上——比如癌症研究？”时，我会非常生气。当我们确实找到癌症治疗方法时，部分基础知识将来自太空。最终我们会在那里发现更重要的秘密：也许有一天，可以治愈死亡本身……​
