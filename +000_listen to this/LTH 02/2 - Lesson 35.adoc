Lesson 35



== part 1. 部分

Tom: …​ when I was living …​ in North Africa, and I had a cook, and I’d been there for several years, you see.

[.my2]
汤姆：……当我住在北非时……我有一个厨师，你看，我在那里已经好几年了。

And I was just going to come on leave to England, you see, and obviously it was quite a long leave, you know.

[.my2]
我正要去英国休假，你看，显然这是一个很长的假期，你知道。

I was coming for …​ three months, I think it was.

[.my2]
我要来……三个月，我想是的。

So I had to, I had a house and I had to sort of close the house up, obviously, and, erm, this chap who worked for me, who was a sort of …​ cook, erm, he was …​ obviously going to go off, you know, for three months-there wasn’t any point in him staying there-so it was, I was getting everything ready, anyway.

[.my2]
所以我必须这样做，我有一所房子，显然我必须把房子关起来，而且，呃，这个为我工作的家伙，他是一个……厨师，呃，他……显然要去要离开，你知道，三个月——他留在那里没有任何意义——所以，无论如何，我已经准备好了一切。

And I had a lot of things to fix up, so I’d got rather a lot of cash out of the bank.

[.my2]
而且我还有很多事情要处理，所以我从银行取出了相当多的现金。

You know, I had a lot of bills to pay (Yes) and things to do, and, erm, I had about sixty-five pounds, I think it was.

[.my2]
你知道，我有很多账单要付（是的）和很多事情要做，而且，呃，我有大约六十五英镑，我想是的。

And one particular evening, I was just sort of, you know, clearing up the sitting-room and going to go to bed, I put the sixty-five quid under the papers in the top left-hand drawer of my desk and then I went out of the door on to the veranda and locked the door.

[.my2]
一个特别的晚上，我只是，你知道，清理起居室并准备上床睡觉，我把六十五英镑放在桌子左上方抽屉里的文件下面，然后我出了门，走到阳台上，锁上了门。

And the point was, all the rooms of the house sort of opened on to a veranda, on to a courtyard, if you see what I mean.

[.my2]
重点是，房子的所有房间都通向阳台，通向庭院，如果你明白我的意思的话。

There weren’t passages inside the house.

[.my2]
屋内没有通道。

And, erm, then I went to bed.

[.my2]
然后，呃，然后我就去睡觉了。

So, the next morning I got up, and, erm …​ after I’d had my breakfast, I was going out into the town to do various things for which I needed the money, you see (Yes) and, erm, I went to the drawer to get it …​ and it wasn’t there! I immediately thought, well maybe my cook, Idris, has taken this, because, the thing was, that the rooms were all locked and you couldn’t have got in to the, erm, to the room, or any of the rooms of the house, without showing some sort of sign of entry, if you see what I mean.

[.my2]
所以，第二天早上我起床，嗯……吃完早餐后，我要去城里做各种我需要钱的事情，你看（是的），嗯，我去抽屉里拿……​但它不在那里！我立即想到，也许我的厨师伊德里斯拿走了这个，因为，问题是，房间都锁着，你不可能进入，呃，进入这个房间，或者任何一个房间。房子，没有任何进入的迹象，如果你明白我的意思的话。

(Yes) And, er, he had access to all the keys in the house, you know.

[.my2]
（是的）而且，呃，他可以使用房子里的所有钥匙，你知道。

(Oh, I see.) So, erm, I went to his room.

[.my2]
（哦，我明白了。） 所以，呃，我去了他的房间。

And, erm, he’d gone off already.

[.my2]
而且，呃，他已经走了。

He’d gone shopping, in fact.

[.my2]
事实上，他去购物了。

In fact, his room was locked.

[.my2]
事实上，他的房间是锁着的。

Erm, I got the keys, unlocked it, went in, sort of searched the room, …​ felt rather sort of …​ guilty, you know, at sort of going through his personal possessions in this way.

[.my2]
嗯，我拿到了钥匙，打开了门，进去，搜查了房间，……感觉有点……内疚，你知道，以这种方式翻阅他的个人物品。

But there was nothing there.

[.my2]
但那里什么也没有。

So, you know, I thought, 'Well, hell, what do I do next? I’d better go to the police'.

[.my2]
所以，你知道，我想，‘好吧，见鬼，接下来我该怎么办？我最好去警察局。”

And, erm, my mind was still very much on him, that …​ it must be him.

[.my2]
而且，呃，我的心思仍然在他身上，那……一定是他。

Erm, so I went down to the police station and, erm, said that the money’d been stolen and would the police please come to the house, and investigate.

[.my2]
呃，所以我去了警察局，呃，说钱被偷了，请警察来家里调查一下。

And would they also …​ investigate my cook, whom I suspected.

[.my2]
他们还会……调查我怀疑的我的厨师吗？

And they said, erm, well, they wouldn’t come and search the cook or look round the house unless I made a definite accusation against him.

[.my2]
他们说，呃，好吧，除非我对他提出明确的指控，否则他们不会来搜查厨师或搜查房子。

And if I made a definite accusation against him, they’d come along and, er, take him back to the police station and really sort it out.

[.my2]
如果我对他提出明确的指控，他们就会过来，呃，把他带回警察局，真正解决问题。

Well, I wasn’t very happy about that, because I felt, erm, I didn’t really have any evidence, you know, I was just extremely suspicious of him because of the circumstances.

[.my2]
嗯，我对此不太高兴，因为我觉得，呃，我真的没有任何证据，你知道，我只是因为当时的情况而对他非常怀疑。

So, erm, I said, 'No,' and, but felt pretty desperate about it then.

[.my2]
所以，呃，我说，“不”，但是当时我感到非常绝望。

So I went back to the house …​ Anyway, later in the day, I said to him, 'You know, I had sixty-five pounds, which I put in the desk, and it’s disappeared.' And he sort of said, 'Oh, yeah'.

[.my2]
所以我回到了房子……无论如何，那天晚些时候，我对他说，“你知道，我有六十五英镑，我把它放在桌子上，然后它就消失了。”他有点说，“哦，是的”。

You know, he didn…​ didn’t register anything at all.

[.my2]
你知道，他……根本没有注册任何东西。

Er, so I said, 'Yes, sixty-five pounds has disappeared and nobody seems to have come into the house'.

[.my2]
呃，所以我说，‘是的，六十五磅不见了，而且似乎没有人进过房子’。

And he sort of said, 'Oh yeah, well', (you know).

[.my2]
他有点说，“哦，是的，好吧”，（你知道）。

So I said, 'Yes, I’m going to get the police'.

[.my2]
所以我说，‘是的，我要去报警’。

And he still didn’t sort of register anything, you know.

[.my2]
你知道，他仍然没有登记任何东西。

He just sort of shrugged his shoulders.

[.my2]
他只是耸了耸肩。

So then I thought, 'Well, the only thing to do is that I’ll have to tell him that, erm, that’s it, you know, I don’t want him to work for me any more'.

[.my2]
所以我想，‘好吧，唯一要做的就是我必须告诉他，嗯，就是这样，你知道，我不想让他再为我工作了’。

But, erm, being a coward over these sort of things, I let it drift for about a couple of days, and then, the day I was actually going, erm, I said to him, er, you know, 'Idris, I’m afraid that, er, I don’t want you to come back after the holidays.

[.my2]
但是，呃，作为这类事情上的胆小鬼，我让它漂流了大约几天，然后，在我真正要去的那天，呃，我对他说，呃，你知道，‘伊德里斯，我恐怕，呃，假期结束后我不想让你回来。

I think it’s better if you don’t work for me any more.' And, er, he immediately made a tremendous speech, he said what the hell did I think I was doing, etcetera, etcetera, why, what were my reasons, etcetera, etcetera.

[.my2]
我想你最好不要再为我工作了。”而且，呃，他立即发表了一场精彩的演讲，他说我到底在做什么，等等，等等，为什么，我的理由是什么，等等，等等。

So I said, probably very stupidly, but I said to him, 'Well, you know about that sixty-five pounds that disappeared, well, I’m not saying you took it, but I just think you might’ve taken it, and therefore I don’t feel I can trust you any more and, er, so I just don’t think you can go on working for me.' So, of course, that was it! He absolutely went through the roof at this! And, erm, you know, gave me a sort of tremendous …​ tirade.

[.my2]
所以我说，可能非常愚蠢，但我对他说，‘好吧，你知道那六十五磅消失了，好吧，我不是说你拿走了它，但我只是认为你可能拿走了它，因此我觉得我不能再信任你了，呃，所以我认为你不能继续为我工作。所以，当然，就是这样！他在这件事上绝对是气炸了！而且，呃，你知道，给了我一种巨大的……长篇大论。

Anyway, I’d quite made up my mind, although I’d taken so long to tell him …​ And I said, 'Well, sorry', you know, 'that’s it.' Then, in fact, erm, a friend dropped in, erm, who, who, who was a great friend.

[.my2]
不管怎样，我已经下定决心了，尽管我花了很长时间才告诉他……我说，“好吧，抱歉”，你知道，“就是这样。”然后，事实上，呃，一个朋友过来了，呃，谁，谁，谁是一个很好的朋友。

He, he, he lived there, he was a local person.

[.my2]
他他他住在那里，他是当地人。

And, erm, Osman came in and he sort of …​ started getting involved in the conversation, …​ anyway, I wasn’t going to change my attitude over it.

[.my2]
而且，呃，奥斯曼进来了，他有点……开始参与谈话，……无论如何，我不会改变我对此的态度。

Then Idris got terribly upset and was all sort of sad about it and upset about it and started to cry, said I was ruining his life, etcetera.

[.my2]
然后伊德里斯变得非常沮丧，对此感到非常难过，并开始哭泣，说我毁了他的生活，等等。

But, anyway, I was completely sort of hard-hearted about it and didn’t do anything about it and that was it.

[.my2]
但是，无论如何，我对此完全是铁石心肠，没有采取任何行动，仅此而已。

And he went. 他就去了。

I, er, I mean I …​ paid him, …​ you know, quite a bit of money in lieu of notice and everything but, I mean, he still felt extremely upset, and it was one of those, erm, very kind of unpleasant things, which left one …​ feeling …​ rather …​ upset about it and not knowing…​ I never knew whether I’d done quite the right thing or not.

[.my2]
我，呃，我的意思是我……付给了他，……你知道，一大笔钱代替通知等等，但是，我的意思是，他仍然感到非常沮丧，这是其中之一，呃，非常友善一些不愉快的事情，这让一个人……感觉……更确切地说……感到不安，却不知道……我从来不知道我是否做了正确的事情。

Well, I worked there for a couple of years more and when I was finally leaving after two years I was throwing out lots and lots of things like magazines, books and so on, and this chap, Osman, who’d actually been there the afternoon Idris had finally left amidst all these rows, I gave him some old magazines, including actually, er, an old Encounter and, erm, he came back a few days later and he said, 'You know, I didn’t know whether to actually come and tell you or not, but I was looking through that copy of Encounter you gave me and I found sixty-five pounds (laughter) in the back of the magazine.' Terribly difficult because I was leaving the country, never to come back, you know, in about twenty-four hours after that …​ feeling that one had done something wrong which one couldn’t put right! And I didn’t have any idea what had happened to Idris, in fact.

[.my2]
嗯，我在那里工作了几年，当我最终在两年后离开时，我扔掉了很多很多东西，比如杂志、书籍等等，而这个小伙子奥斯曼，他实际上曾经去过那里下午，伊德里斯终于在这些人群中离开了，我给了他一些旧杂志，实际上包括，呃，一本旧的《邂逅》，呃，几天后他回来了，他说，“你知道，我不知道是否来告诉你或不告诉你，但我正在翻阅你给我的那本《邂逅》，我在杂志背面发现了六十五英镑（笑声）。非常困难，因为我要离开这个国家，再也不会回来，你知道，在那之后大约二十四小时内……感觉自己做了错事，无法纠正！事实上，我根本不知道伊德里斯发生了什么事。

Pretty unfortunate! 相当不幸！

== part 2. 部分

In the summer of 1933, the world’s first drive-in movie theatre opened in Camden, New Jersey. Drive-ins became popular after World War II and in the '50s there were nearly five thousand theatres across the country. But today, less than three thousand remained. Drive-ins are in trouble. Land values near cities are increasing and drive-ins are being torn down to make way for malls. And families are more likely to stay home for an evening of cheap entertainment with their VCRs and cable TV. When one more drive-in closed recently outside Jeffersonville, Indiana, reporter Bob Hanson was there, the last night at the Lakewood Drive-in.

[.my2]
1933 年夏天，世界上第一家汽车电影院在新泽西州卡姆登开业。汽车影院在二战后开始流行，20世纪50年代全国有近5000家影院。但今天，只剩下不到三千人了。汽车电影院有麻烦了。城市附近的土地价值正在上涨，汽车影院正在被拆除，为购物中心让路。家庭更有可能呆在家里，用录像机和有线电视享受一晚的廉价娱乐。最近，印第安纳州杰斐逊维尔郊外又一家汽车影院关闭时，记者鲍勃·汉森 (Bob Hanson) 也在场，那是在莱克伍德汽车影院的最后一晚。

The sun set as the last cars entered the Lakewood Drive-in. At the ticket booth Laura Boyle filled in for her daughter who’s away at college. No money changed hands. The show was on the house.

[.my2]
当最后一辆车驶入莱克伍德汽车影院时，太阳已经落山了。在售票亭，劳拉·博伊尔 (Laura Boyle) 为她在外上大学的女儿补票。没有钱易手。演出在房子里进行。

Thirty years ago John Walley opened the Lakewood Drive-in on his father’s farmland in southern Indiana. Corn fields still surround the theatre. Since 1956 people have driven for miles to get to the drive-in. They came in Studebakers, and Fords, Ramblars, and Corvats. But the '80s haven’t been so kind to the drive-in. And on this night John Walley is closing up.

[.my2]
三十年前，约翰·沃利 (John Walley) 在他父亲位于印第安纳州南部的农田上开设了莱克伍德汽车影院 (Lakewood Drive-in)。剧院周围仍然有玉米地。自 1956 年以来，人们驾车数英里才能到达汽车影院。他们开着斯图贝克（Studebaker）、福特（Ford）、兰布拉（Ramblars）和科尔瓦（Corvats）。但 80 年代对于汽车影院来说就没那么友善了。今晚约翰·沃利要关门了。

Before the show started, parents took their children to a playground in the front of the theatre. Framed by an orange sky and in the humid Mid-western air, they played on swings and slides. Inside the snack bar, the menu was timeless.

[.my2]
演出开始前，家长们带着孩子来到剧院前的游乐场。在橙色的天空和中西部潮湿的空气中，他们玩着秋千和滑梯。小吃店里的菜单是永恒的。

"Forty cents is your change, thank you."
“四十美分是你的零钱，谢谢。”

Thelma Wilson stuffed hotdogs in buns and wrapped them in aluminum foil bags. For twenty-three years Thelma has cooked hotdogs, popped popcorn and filled drinks in the Lakewood Drive-in.

[.my2]
塞尔玛·威尔逊将热狗塞进面包里，然后用铝箔袋包起来。二十三年来，塞尔玛一直在莱克伍德汽车餐厅里煮热狗、爆米花和倒饮料。

In the mid-sixties, five hundred cars would fill the ashfall and dirt theatre. But in the eighties, seventy-five cars was considered a good night. And sometimes the movie’s played to just twenty.

[.my2]
六十年代中期，五百辆汽车填满了火山灰和泥土剧院。但在八十年代，七十五辆汽车就被认为是一个美好的夜晚。有时电影只播放到二十点。

Carlo Crown switched on the thirty-five millimeter projector for the last time. About a hundred seventy-five cars pointed at the crumbling while screen. As word got out that the Lakewood Drive-in was closing up, people came from throughout the area. As the black and white images flickered on the screen, some people found themselves back in time. Like Linda King, who spent her wedding night here twenty-two years ago.

[.my2]
卡洛·克朗最后一次打开了三十五毫米投影仪。大约有一百七十五辆汽车指向摇摇欲坠的屏幕。当莱克伍德汽车电影院即将关闭的消息传出后，人们从整个地区涌来。随着屏幕上黑白图像的闪烁，一些人发现自己回到了过去。就像琳达·金 (Linda King) 一样，二十二年前她在这里度过了新婚之夜。

"There’s a lot of memories here. I’ve brought all my kids here, my grandkids, and they are not going to be here any more. So they aren’t going to bring their children here when they’re grown."

[.my2]
“这里有很多回忆。我把我所有的孩子和孙子都带到了这里，他们不会再来这里了。所以当他们的孩子长大后，他们不会再把他们带到这里了。”

Johnny Buckman and his wife Merilyn watched the movie from their tinted glass window. The two went out on dates here twenty-seven years ago.

[.my2]
约翰尼·巴克曼和他的妻子梅里琳通过有色玻璃窗观看了这部电影。二十七年前，两人曾在这里约会过。

"I have been thinking about, you know, when we were young, and when he put his arms around me and . . . and just a lot of old memories, you know."

[.my2]
“我一直在想，你知道，当我们年轻的时候，当他用双臂搂住我的时候......还有很多旧的回忆，你知道。”

John Walley stood outside the snack bar and talked to old friends and customers. He talked about how hard it was to compete with air-conditioned theatres and couldn’t get first-run movies any more. And most of all he just reminisced.

[.my2]
约翰·沃利站在小吃店外面，与老朋友和顾客交谈。他谈到与空调影院竞争是多么困难，无法再获得首映电影。最重要的是，他只是回忆起来。

"This is nice to go out to the country and watch movies on a big screen. The young people just don’t know what they are missing because there won’t be any drive-ins around in another ten years.

[.my2]
“到乡下看大屏幕电影真是太好了。年轻人只是不知道他们错过了什么，因为再过十年，周围就不会再有汽车影院了。”

Some people watched the movie from the hood of their car. Others sat on lawn chairs. Many just walked around. John Walley plastered auction off the equipment from the drive-in. But in the dark people tried not to think about that. By the way, tonight’s final film — The Last Picture Show. For National Public Radio, I’m Bob Henson in southern Indiana.

[.my2]
有些人在汽车引擎盖上观看了这部电影。其他人则坐在草坪椅上。许多人只是四处走走。约翰·沃利在汽车电影院拍卖了设备。但在黑暗中，人们试图不去想这个。顺便说一下，今晚的最后一部电影——《最后一场电影》。我是国家公共广播电台的鲍勃·汉森，来自印第安纳州南部。

== 3. Technology and the Future (II)

三、科技与未来（二）
Now I would like to say a word about communications. The revolution in communications that has already taken place is still not fully understood. One way of appreciating it is to do a kind of communications strip tease. I would like you to abolish in your minds TV, then radio, then telephones, then the postal service, then the newspapers. In other words, to revert to the Middle Ages. In such a situation, we should feel deaf and blind, like prisoners in solitary confinement. Well, we’ll appear this way to our grandchildren. Don’t forget that a generation has already grown up that never knew a world without TV. One communications revolution has taken place in our lifetime. The next revolution, perhaps the final one, will be the result of satellites and microelectronics, which will enable us to do literally anything we want to in the field of communications and information transfer — including, ultimately, not only sound and vision but all sense impressions.

[.my2]
现在我想谈谈沟通。已经发生的通信革命尚未完全被理解。欣赏它的一种方法是进行一种通讯脱衣舞表演。我希望你们在心中废除电视，然后是广播，然后是电话，然后是邮政服务，然后是报纸。换句话说，就是回到中世纪。在这种情况下，我们应该感到又聋又瞎，就像单独监禁的囚犯一样。好吧，我们会以这样的方式出现在我们的孙子面前。不要忘记，已经长大的一代人永远不知道没有电视的世界。我们一生中发生了一场通信革命。下一场革命，也许是最后一场革命，将是卫星和微电子技术的结果，这将使我们能够在通信和信息传输领域做任何我们想做的事情——最终不仅包括声音和视觉，还包括所有感官印象。

I am particularly interested in TV broadcasting from satellites directly into the home, bypassing today’s ground stations — a proposal I first described twenty-two years ago. This will mean the abolition of all present geographical restrictions to TV; via satellites, any country can broadcast to any other. Direct-broadcast TV will be possible within five years and may be most important to undeveloped countries that have no ground stations, and now may never require any. Africa, China, and South America could be opened up by direct TV broadcast, and whole populations brought into the modern world. I believe that communications satellites may bring about the long-overdue end of the Stone Age.

[.my2]
我对绕过今天的地面站，直接从卫星向家庭发送电视广播特别感兴趣——这是我二十二年前首次描述的提议。这将意味着取消目前对电视的所有地域限制；通过卫星，任何国家都可以向其他国家广播。直播电视将在五年内成为可能，这对于没有地面站的不发达国家来说可能是最重要的，但现在可能永远不需要任何地面站。非洲、中国和南美可以通过电视直播打开大门，把所有人口带入现代世界。我相信通信卫星可能会带来早该结束的石器时代。

They will certainly lead to a global telephone system and end long-distance calls — for all calls will be 'local'! There will be the same flat rate everywhere.

[.my2]
它们肯定会带来全球电话系统并结束长途电话——因为所有电话都将是“本地”的！各地均采用相同的统一费率。

Newspapers will, I think, receive their final body blow from these new communications techniques. How I look forward to the day when I can press a button and get any type of news, editorials, book and theatre reviews, etc., merely by dialing the right channel. Moreover, not only today’s but any newspaper ever published will be available. Some sort of TV-like console connected to a central electronic library, could make available any information ever printed in any form. Electronic 'mail' delivery is another exciting prospect of the very near future. Letters, will be automatically read and flashed from continent to continent and reproduced at receiving stations within a few minutes of transmission.

[.my2]
我认为，这些新的通讯技术将给报纸带来最后的打击。我多么期待有一天，我只需拨打正确的频道，按下一个按钮，就能获得任何类型的新闻、社论、书籍和剧院评论等。此外，不仅是今天的报纸，任何曾经出版过的报纸都可以使用。某种类似电视的控制台连接到中央电子图书馆，可以提供以任何形式印刷的任何信息。电子“邮件”传递是不久的将来另一个令人兴奋的前景。信件将被自动读取并从一个大陆闪到另一个大陆，并在传输后几分钟内在接收站复制。

All these things are associated with information processing, and one-third of the Gross National Product is now spent on this in one form of another — data storage, TV, radio, books, and so forth. This radio is increasing; our society is changing from a goods-producing society to an information-processing one. I have devoted much of one book (Voices from the Sky) to the social consequences of this, and can mention only a few here.

[.my2]
所有这些事情都与信息处理有关，国民生产总值的三分之一现在以一种或另一种形式花费在信息处理上——数据存储、电视、广播、书籍等等。这种广播正在增加；我们的社会正在从商品生产社会转变为信息处理社会。我在一本书（《天空之声》）中用了很多篇幅来讨论这种现象的社会后果，这里只能提及其中的一小部分。

One could be the establishment of English as the world language, through the direct telecast satellites mentioned above. Within the next ten years the future language of mankind will be decided, in a bloodless battle twenty-two thousand miles above the equator.

[.my2]
其中之一可能是通过上面提到的直播卫星将英语确立为世界语言。在接下来的十年内，人类未来的语言将在赤道上空两万两千英里的一场不流血的战斗中决定。

Another very important consequence will be a change in the patterns of transport, for a man and his work need no longer be in the same place. When these new information-and-communications consoles are available, almost anybody who does any kind of mental work can live wherever he pleases. Beyond this, any kind of manipulative skill can also be transferred from one point to another. I can imagine a time when even a brain surgeon can live in one place and operate on patients all over the world, through remote-controlled artificial hands, like those used in atomic energy plants.

[.my2]
另一个非常重要的后果将是交通方式的改变，因为人和他的工作不再需要在同一个地方。当这些新的信息和通信控制台可用时，几乎任何从事任何脑力工作的人都可以住在他喜欢的任何地方。除此之外，任何一种操作技能也可以从一个点转移到另一个点。我可以想象有一天，即使是脑外科医生也可以住在一个地方，通过遥控人造手（就像原子能工厂使用的人造手）为世界各地的患者进行手术。

Yet these developments will not necessarily mean an overall reduction of transport. I see a great reduction of transport for work, but increased transport for pleasure.

[.my2]
然而，这些发展并不一定意味着交通运输总量的减少。我发现工作交通大幅减少，但娱乐交通却增加。

A result of this will be that vast uninhabited areas of the Earth could be opened up, because people will have far greater freedom to choose where they will live.

[.my2]
其结果将是地球上大片无人居住的地区将被开放，因为人们将有更大的自由来选择他们的居住地点。

These trends will inevitably accelerate the disintegration of the cities, whose historical function is now passing. Cities will go on growing, of course, like dinosaurs — for the same reasons, and with the same results.

[.my2]
这些趋势将不可避免地加速城市的解体，而城市的历史功能正在消失。当然，城市会像恐龙一样继续发展——出于同样的原因，也会产生同样的结果。
