Lesson 23



== part

Interviewer: Hello. My name's Hudson. Dick Hudson.


Applicant: I'm Pamela Gable.


Interviewer: Well, take a seat, please. Miss Gable — it is Miss, isn't it? Thought so. Well, let me just check that I've got these particulars right. Your surname is Gable, spelt G-A-B-L-E, and your first names are Pamela Ann ... Fine. You live at 147 Collington Road, Croydon ... your telephone number is 246 8008 ... you were born on July 8th, 1965, and ... that's about it ... OK? Fine ... Let's see ... what are you working with at the moment?


Applicant: I'm the personal assistant to the manager of a modelling agency.


Interviewer: Oh, really? And what does that involve?


Applicant: A bit of everything, really. I have to keep the accounts, write a few letters, answer the telephone, look after bookings and engagements and that sort of thing.


Interviewer: You work with people a lot, do you?


Applicant: Oh yes. I have to look after all the models who work for us, you know, keep them happy, lend an understanding ear to their heartaches, you know.


Interviewer: Have you ever done anything to do with hotels or conferences — hotel management, for instance?


Applicant: No, not really. I did work for a short time as a courier for a tour operator, taking foreigners on guided tours of London. Perhaps that's the sort of thing you mean?


Interviewer: Yes, I think it is. Do you speak any languages?


Applicant: Yes, I do. I speak French and Italian — you see, I spent several years abroad when I was younger.


Interviewer: Oh, did you? That's very interesting. And what about any exams you've taken?


Applicant: Well, I left school at 16. You know, there didn't seem to be any point in staying on somehow; I was sure I could learn much more by getting a job and a bit of experience and independence.


Interviewer: So you have no formal qualifications at all? I see ... Well, I don't suppose it matters.


Applicant: Um ... I was wondering if perhaps you could tell me a bit more about the job? You know, it said in the ad that you wanted a go ahead girl with car and imagination, but that's not very much to go on.


Interviewer: No, it isn't. Well, we run conferences, and your job as conference coordinator would be, well, much the same as the one you have now, I suppose. Meeting people, transporting them from one place to another, making sure they're comfortable, a bit of telephoning, and so on.


Applicant: It sounds like just the sort of thing I want to do.


Interviewer: There is the question of salary, of course.


Applicant: Well, my present salary is 8,000 pounds, so I couldn't accept any less than that. Especially if I have to use my car.


Interviewer: Ah! We have something like 7,500 in mind, plus of course a generous allowance for the car. But look, if I were you, I'd take some time to think about this. Perhaps you'd care to have a quick look round the office here, see if you like the look of the people who work here.


Applicant: What do you think I should do then ...?


采访者：你好。我叫哈德森。迪克·哈德森。

申请人：我是帕梅拉·盖博。

面试官：好的，请坐。盖博小姐——是小姐，不是吗？也这么觉得。好吧，让我检查一下这些细节是否正确。你的姓氏是盖博，拼写为 G-A-B-L-E，你的名字是帕梅拉·安……很好。您住在克罗伊登科林顿路 147 号……您的电话号码是 246 8008……您出生于 1965 年 7 月 8 日，并且……就这样……好吗？好吧……让我们看看……你现在在做什么？

申请人：我是一家模特经纪公司经理的私人助理。

采访者：哦，真的吗？这涉及什么？

申请人：真的，什么都有一点。我必须记账、写几封信、接电话、处理预订和约会之类的事情。

采访者：你经常与人打交道，是吗？

申请人：哦，是的。我必须照顾所有为我们工作的模特，让他们开心，理解他们的心痛，你知道。

采访者：您曾经做过与酒店或会议有关的事情吗？例如酒店管理？

申请人：不，不完全是。我曾在一家旅行社做过短暂的快递员工作，带外国人参观伦敦。也许这就是你的意思？

采访者：是的，我想是的。你会说任何语言吗？

申请人：是的，我愿意。我会说法语和意大利语——你看，我年轻时在国外呆过几年。

采访者：哦，是吗？这很有趣。你参加过的考试怎么样？

申请人：嗯，我 16 岁就离开了学校。你知道，以某种方式留下来似乎没有任何意义；我确信通过找到一份工作、一点经验和独立性，我可以学到更多东西。

采访者：所以你根本就没有正式的资格吗？我明白了……好吧，我认为这并不重要。

求职者：嗯……我想知道你是否可以告诉我更多关于这份工作的信息？你知道，广告里说你想要一个有车、有想象力、勇往直前的女孩，但这并没有什么意义。

采访者：不，不是。好吧，我们举办会议，我想你作为会议协调员的工作将与你现在的工作大致相同。与人会面，将他们从一个地方运送到另一个地方，确保他们感到舒适，打电话等等。

申请人：这听起来正是我想做的事情。

面试官：当然还有工资问题。

应聘者：嗯，我现在的工资是8000英镑，所以我不能接受低于这个数字的工资。特别是如果我必须使用我的车的话。

采访者：啊！我们的预算是 7,500 左右，当然还要加上丰厚的汽车补贴。但是你看，如果我是你，我会花一些时间考虑这个问题。也许您想快速浏览一下这里的办公室，看看您是否喜欢在这里工作的人的外表。

申请人：你认为我应该做什么……​？

Ann: When did you discover that you had this talent for hypnosis, Dr. Parker?


Dr. Parker: When I was a final year medical student, actually. I'd been reading a lot about it and decided to try it myself on a few friends, you know — using certain well-tried techniques.


Ann: And you were successful.


Dr. Parker: Well, yes. I was amazed at how quickly I was able to do it.


Ann: Could you tell me more about these techniques?


Dr. Parker: Certainly. My method has changed very little since I started. To begin with, I get the subject to lie comfortably on a sofa, which helps to relax the body. You see, in order to reach a person's mind, you have to make him forget his body as much as possible. Then I tell him to concentrate on my voice. Some experts claim that the sound of the voice is one of the most powerful tools in hypnosis.


Ann: Do you have an assistant with you?


Dr. Parker: Yes, but only as a secretary. He always sits well in the background, taking notes and looking after the recording equipment. Then I tell the subject not to think about what I'm saying but just to accept it.


Ann: Don't you use a swinging watch or flashing lights?


Dr. Parker: No. At first I used to rely on the ticking of a clock — some say that boring, repetitive sounds help — but now I simply get my patient to stare at some object in the room. At this point I suggest that he's feeling sleepy and that his body's becoming so relaxed that he can hardly feel it.


Ann: Be careful, Dr. Parker, I'm beginning to feel very drowsy myself.


Dr. Parker: Don't worry. I won't make you do anything silly, I promise.


Ann: What you're saying, then, is that you want to control your patient's mind, and that to do this you have first to take care of the body.


Dr. Parker: Yes. You see, the aim of the session is to make the patient remember in great detail an experience which has caused him a lot of pain and suffering, and by doing that to help him to face his problems.


Ann: I've heard a person's memory is far more powerful under hypnosis.


Dr. Parker: Indeed it is. Some of the things that patients are able to remember are just incredible.


Ann: Would you mind giving me an example?


Dr. Parker: Not at all. During a session, it's standard procedure to take a patient back in time slowly, pausing at certain times in his life and asking a few questions.


Ann: To, sort of, set the scene before you go deeper. Is that what you mean?


Dr. Parker: That's it exactly. Well, once, I took a thirty-five-year-old lady back to the age of eight — in fact, I told her it was her eighth birthday and I asked her what day it was. I later checked a calendar for that year and she was right — it was a Tuesday. She even told me who was at her party, their names, what they were wearing and about the presents she received. I mean, can you remember even your last birthday?


Ann: I couldn't even tell you what day my birthday fell on this year.


Dr. Parker: Precisely. And when I asked her to write down her address at that time, the handwriting was in a very immature style. I later compared it to a sample from some old school exercise books her mother had kept and it was identical.


Ann: Dr. Parker, that's an amazing story.


Dr. Parker: I've taken patients back to their first year and a few even further than that ... but that's another story, unless you've got plenty of time ...





安：帕克博士，你什么时候发现自己有催眠天赋的？

帕克博士：实际上，当我还是一名医学院学生的最后一年时。我读了很多关于它的文章，并决定自己在几个朋友身上尝试一下，你知道的——使用某些久经考验的技术。

安：你成功了。

帕克博士：嗯，是的。我对自己能如此快地完成这件事感到惊讶。

安：你能告诉我更多关于这些技术的信息吗？

帕克博士：当然。自从我开始以来，我的方法几乎没有改变。首先，我让拍摄对象舒适地躺在沙发上，这有助于放松身体。你看，要想到达一个人的心灵，就得让他尽可能的忘记自己的身体。然后我告诉他集中注意力在我的声音上。一些专家声称声音是催眠中最强大的工具之一。

安：你有助理吗？

Parker 博士：是的，但只能作为秘书。他总是坐在后台，记笔记并照看录音设备。然后我告诉受试者不要思考我所说的话，而只是接受它。

安：你不使用摆动的手表或闪光灯吗？

帕克博士：不。起初我常常依靠时钟的滴答声——有人说无聊、重复的声音有帮助——但现在我只是让我的病人盯着房间里的某个物体。此时我建议他感到困倦，并且他的身体变得如此放松，以至于他几乎感觉不到。

安：小心点，帕克医生，我自己也开始感到很困了。

帕克博士：别担心。我不会让你做任何傻事，我保证。

安：那么，你的意思是，你想控制病人的思想，而要做到这一点，你首先要照顾好身体。

帕克博士：是的。你看，治疗的目的是让病人详细地记住给他带来很多痛苦和磨难的经历，并通过这样做来帮助他面对他的问题。

安：我听说人在催眠状态下记忆力更强。

帕克博士：确实如此。患者能够记住的一些事情简直令人难以置信。

安：你介意给我举个例子吗？

帕克博士：一点也不。在治疗过程中，标准程序是让病人慢慢回到过去，在他生命中的某些时刻停下来问一些问题。

安：在深入之前，先设置场景。你是这个意思吗？

帕克博士：正是如此。嗯，有一次，我把一位三十五岁的女士带回到八岁——事实上，我告诉她今天是她的八岁生日，然后我问她今天是什么日子。后来我查了那一年的日历，她是对的——那是星期二。她甚至告诉我谁参加了她的聚会，他们的名字，他们穿什么以及她收到的礼物。我的意思是，你还记得你上次的生日吗？

安：我什至无法告诉你今年我的生日是哪一天。

帕克博士：没错。当我让她写下她当时的地址时，字迹非常不成熟。后来我将其与她母亲保留的一些旧学校练习册中的样本进行了比较，结果是相同的。

安：帕克博士，这是一个了不起的故事。

帕克博士：我已经把病人带回到了他们的第一年，还有一些甚至比那更远……但那是另一个故事了，除非你有足够的时间……​

These days it's hard enough to find a suitable job, let alone get as far as an interview. Dozens of people every day scour the Situations Vacant columns of the press, send off their curriculum vitae or application form, and wait hopefully to be summoned for an interview. Now this, apparently, is where a lot of people fall down, because of their inadequacy at completing their application forms, according to Judith Davidson, author of Getting a Job, a book which has recently come on the market. This book, as the title suggests, is crammed full of useful tips on how to set about finding yourself work in these difficult times. Our reporter, Christopher Shields, decided to look into this apparent inability of the British to sell themselves, and he spoke to Judith Davidson about it.


Judith: Very often a job application or a curriculum vitae will contain basic grammatical or careless spelling mistakes, even from university graduates. Then those that do get as far as an interview become inarticulate or clumsy when they try to talk about themselves. It doesn't matter how highly qualified or brilliant you may be, if you come across as tongue-tied and gauche, your chances of getting a job are pretty small.


Christopher: Judith Davidson lectures at a management training college for young men and women, most of whom have just graduated from university and gone there to take a crash course in management techniques. One of the hardest things is, not passing the course examinations successfully, but actually finding employment afterwards, so Judith now concentrates on helping trainees to set about doing just this.


Judith: Some letters are dirty and untidily written, with finger marks all over them and ink blots or even coffee stains. Others arrive on lined or flowered or sometimes scented paper — none of which is likely to make a good impression on the average business-like boss.


Christopher: This apparent inability of many people to make that initial impact with an employer by sending him an application which will stand out from the rest and persuade him you're the right one for the job prompted an enterprising young man, called Mark Ashworth, a recruitment consultant himself, to start writing job applications for other people for a fee, as a sideline. He told me he got the idea in America where it's already big business, and in the last few months alone he's written over 250 c.v.s. He feels that 80 per cent of job applications received by personnel managers are inadequate in some way.


Mark: Many people simply can't cope with grammar and spelling and don't know what to put in, or leave out. Sometimes people condense their work experience so much that a future employer doesn't know enough about them. Then, on the other hand, some people go too far the other way. To give you an example, one c.v. I once received in my recruiting role was getting on for thirty pages long.


Christopher: Mark has an initial interview with all his clients in which he tries to make them think about their motivation and why they've done certain things in the past. He can often exploit these experiences in the c.v. he writes for them, and show that they have been valuable preparation for the job now sought. He also believes that well-prepared job history and a good letter of application are absolutely essential.


Mark: Among the most important aspects of applications are spelling, correct grammar, content and layout. A new boss will probably also be impressed with a good reference or a letter of commendation written by a former employer. The type of c.v. I aim to produce depends largely on the kind of job being applied for. They don't always have to be slick or highly sophisticated, but in certain cases this does help.


Christopher: Judith Davidson thought very much along the same lines as Mark. In her opinion, one of the most important aspects of job applications was that they should be easy to read ...


Judith: ... Many applicants send in letters and forms which are virtually unreadable. The essence of handwritten application is that they should be neat, legible and the spelling should be accurate. I stress handwritten because most employers want a sample of their future employee's writing. Many believe this gives some indication of the character of the person who wrote it. Some people forget vital things like putting their own address or the date. Others fail to do what's required of them by a job advertisement.


Christopher: Judith believes that job seekers should always send an accompanying letter along with their application form stating clearly why their qualifications make them suitable for the vacancy.


Judith: Personal details have no place in letters of application. I well remember hearing about one such letter which stated, quite bluntly, I need more money to pay for my flat. No boss would be impressed by such directness.


Christopher: She added that the art of applying for jobs successfully was having to be learnt by more and more people these days, with the current unemployment situation. With as many as two or three hundred people applying for one vacancy, a boss would want to see only a small fraction of that number in person for an interview, so your application had to really outshine all the others to get you on the short list.

如今，找到一份合适的工作已经很难了，更不用说面试了。每天都有数十人浏览媒体的职位空缺专栏，寄出简历或申请表，满怀希望地等待面试机会。最近上市的《找工作》一书的作者朱迪思·戴维森表示，显然，这是很多人失败的地方，因为他们没有充分填写申请表。正如标题所示，这本书充满了关于如何在这些困难时期为自己找到工作的有用技巧。我们的记者克里斯托弗·希尔兹（Christopher Shields）决定调查英国人明显无法推销自己的情况，他就此与朱迪思·戴维森（Judith Davidson）进行了交谈。

朱迪思：工作申请或简历经常会包含基本的语法或粗心的拼写错误，即使是大学毕业生也是如此。然后，那些真正接受采访的人在试图谈论自己时就会变得口齿不清或笨拙。不管你的资质有多高、有多聪明，如果你给人一种结结巴巴、粗俗的印象，那么你找到工作的机会就很小。

克里斯托弗：朱迪思·戴维森在一所管理培训学院为年轻男女授课，其中大多数人刚刚大学毕业，去那里参加管理技术速成课程。最难的事情之一是，没有成功通过课程考试，而是在之后找到工作，所以Judith现在专注于帮助学员着手做这件事。

朱迪思：有些信写得又脏又乱，上面到处都是指印、墨迹，甚至还有咖啡渍。其他的则用带有线条、花朵或有时带有香味的纸来送达——这些都不太可能给普通的公事老板留下好印象。

克里斯托弗：许多人显然无法通过向雇主发送一份脱颖而出的申请来对雇主产生最初的影响，并说服他你是这份工作的合适人选，这促使一位名叫马克·阿什沃斯 (Mark Ashworth) 的有进取心的年轻人，自己是一名招聘顾问，开始为其他人撰写收费的工作申请，作为副业。他告诉我，他在美国想到了这个想法，在美国，这已经是一门大生意了，仅在过去几个月里，他就写了 250 多份简历。他认为人事经理收到的 80% 的职位申请在某种程度上都是不充分的。

马克：很多人根本无法应对语法和拼写，也不知道该添加或省​​略什么。有时，人们过于浓缩自己的工作经验，以至于未来的雇主对他们不够了解。另一方面，有些人却走得太远了。举个例子，一份简历。我曾经在招聘岗位上收到过长达三十页的信息。

克里斯托弗：马克对他的所有客户进行了初步采访，他试图让他们思考自己的动机以及为什么他们过去做了某些事情。他经常可以在简历中利用这些经验。他为他们写作，并表明他们为现在寻求的工作做了宝贵的准备。他还认为，准备充分的工作经历和一封好的申请信绝对必要。

马克：申请中最重要的方面是拼写、正确的语法、内容和布局。新老板也可能会对前雇主写的好的推荐信或表扬信印象深刻。简历类型我的目标主要取决于所申请的工作类型。它们并不总是需要圆滑或高度复杂，但在某些情况下这确实有帮助。

克里斯托弗：朱迪思·戴维森的想法与马克非常相似。在她看来，工作申请最重要的方面之一是它们应该易于阅读……​

朱迪思：……​许多申请人寄来的信件和表格几乎无法阅读。手写申请的本质是工整、清晰、拼写准确。我强调手写，因为大多数雇主都想要未来员工的写作样本。许多人认为这可以反映出作者的性格。有些人忘记了一些重要的事情，比如写下自己的地址或日期。其他人则未能按照招聘广告的要求行事。

克里斯托弗：朱迪思认为，求职者应该在申请表的同时附上一封附信，清楚地说明为什么他们的资格使他们适合该职位空缺。

朱迪思：申请信中没有个人信息。我清楚地记得听过一封这样的信，信中直言不讳地说，我需要更多的钱来支付我的公寓费用。没有哪个老板会对这种直率印象深刻。

克里斯托弗：她补充说，在当前的失业形势下，越来越多的人必须学习成功申请工作的艺术。有多达两三百人申请一个职位空缺，老板只希望亲自见到其中的一小部分进行面试，因此您的申请必须真正胜过所有其他申请才能让您进入候选名单。

==== 1. (Literature)



We may note in passing that, although Dr Johnson's friend and biographer, Boswell, was a Scotsman, Johnson despised, or pretended to despise, Scotsmen in general. He once said that the best thing a Scotsman ever saw was the high road to England. In his famous dictionary, Johnson defined oats as 'a grain which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland supports the people'. He did not condemn all Scotsmen, however. Once he commented on a distinguished nobleman who had been born in Scotland but educated in England, saying that much could be made of a Scotsman — if he was caught young.



（文学）


我们可以顺便指出，尽管约翰逊博士的朋友兼传记作者博斯韦尔是苏格兰人，但约翰逊总体上鄙视或假装鄙视苏格兰人。他曾经说过，苏格兰人见过的最美好的事物就是通往英格兰的公路。约翰逊在他著名的字典中将燕麦定义为“一种在英格兰通常喂马的谷物，但在苏格兰却供养人民”。然而，他并没有谴责所有苏格兰人。有一次，他评论了一位出生在苏格兰但在英格兰接受教育的杰出贵族，说苏格兰人可以大有作为——如果他年轻的话。


==== 2. (Geography: American Indians)



The first important point to note about the American Indians is that, in spite of their name, they are in no way related to the peoples of India. This confusion arose, as you probably know, because of a mistake on the part of Christopher Columbus. When he landed in America he thought that he had in fact discovered India. This mistake has been perpetrated, that is kept alive, ever since by the name he gave them. If they are related to any Asian group it is to the Mongols of Northern Asia. Many experts believe that the ancestors of the present American Indians emigrated from Northern Asia across the Bering Strait between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago.



（地理：美洲印第安人）


关于美洲印第安人，需要注意的第一个要点是，尽管他们的名字如此，但他们与印度人民没有任何关系。您可能知道，这种混乱的出现是由于克里斯托弗·哥伦布的一个错误。当他抵达美国时，他认为他实际上发现了印度。这个错误一直在犯下，从他给他们起的名字起就一直存在着。如果说他们与任何亚洲群体有联系的话，那就是北亚的蒙古人。许多专家认为，现在的美洲印第安人的祖先在一万至两万年前从北亚跨越白令海峡移民而来。

==== 3. (Science: methods of scientific discovery)



A good illustration of how scientific discoveries may be made accidentally is the discovery of penicillin. Alexander Fleming was a bacteriologist who for fifteen years had tried to solve the problem of how to get rid of the disease — carrying germs or microbes in the human body without causing any dangerous side-effects. Fleming was an untidy worker and often had innumerable small dishes containing microbes all around his laboratory. One day, one of the dishes was contaminated with a mould, due to the window having been left open. Fleming noticed that the mould had killed off the microbes, and it was from similar moulds that the miracle drug penicillin was finally developed. Of course, only a brilliant scientist like Fleming would have been able to take advantage of this stroke of luck, but the fact remains that the solution to his problem was given to him, literally, on a plate.



（科学：科学发现的方法）


青霉素的发现很好地说明了科学发现是如何偶然产生的。亚历山大·弗莱明 (Alexander Fleming) 是一位细菌学家，十五年来一直致力于解决如何消除疾病的问题，即在人体内携带细菌或微生物而不引起任何危险的副作用。弗莱明是一个不爱整洁的工人，他的实验室周围经常有无数含有微生物的小盘子。有一天，由于窗户开着，其中一个盘子被霉菌污染了。弗莱明注意到霉菌杀死了微生物，正是从类似的霉菌中最终研制出了神奇药物青霉素。当然，只有像弗莱明这样杰出的科学家才能利用这种运气，但事实仍然是，他的问题的解决方案实际上是在盘子里的。


==== 4. (Psychology: memory)



What I want to emphasize to you is this: that people remember things which make sense to them or which they can connect with something they already know. Students who try to memorize what they cannot understand are almost certainly wasting their time.

（心理学：记忆）


我想向你们强调的是：人们会记住对他们有意义的事情，或者可以与他们已经知道的事情联系起来的事情。试图记住自己无法理解的内容的学生几乎肯定是在浪费时间。
