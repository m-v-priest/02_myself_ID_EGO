Lesson 25



== part


Mary: On holiday, one summer, we were camping, of course, (Yes, of course) er, and had been to Italy and, er, back into France (Yeah) and, at the border, we had an awful lot of trouble finding the passport and (Mm) the this and the that, (Mm) to move over from Italy to France, erm, so I was rather disappointed a, at the mess we'd made of it and, as we travelled on into France, I spent the rest of that day tidying up the car (Mhm) and I very carefully put into one folder the passports, the tickets, travellers' cheques and all our currency (Yeah) and it was all beautifully packed so that we wouldn't be caught in this position again of not being able to find (Mhm, Mhm) anything. Erm, we eventually decided to stop in a town where we knew there was a campsite and in the town we stopped at a garage, really to ask the way to the campsite, (Mm) but while we were there we thought, well, we'll get some petrol, erm, and, er, ask the question at the same time. (Yeah) Erm ... the man put the petrol in the car and, with all efficiency, I took out the folder (Yeah) with the money in it (Mhm) and paid for the petrol and then we went on our way. The campsite was about two or three miles away. Er, when we got to the campite, we went into the office and one of the things one usually carries as a camper is a little sort of card, erm, a camping ticket, if you like, and, er, I ...


Tom: What's that for?


Mary: Well, one gets reduced rates for being a (Oh, I see) member of a camping club, (Mm) or something like that. Erm, and I went to get it from the folder, properly packed folder, (Mm) and I could not find the folder! (Oh, God!) We had everything out of the car, all over the floor on the grass, erm, and each one of us was sure we, er, had seen it somewhere since the garage. And we finally had to say to these people, 'We are very sorry, we have no money, no card, no nothing' And ...


Tom: How much money was involved?


Mary: Well, all our holiday money, you know. Some hundreds of pounds, in travellers' cheques and some in currency, you see, a few pounds ...


Tom: And passports?


Mary: And passports, and tickets for the boat (God!) Erm, so we said we'd go to the police station. So back we went to the town. And we all went into the police station. Erm, and a very friendly policeman said, 'Well, I can do nothing about it. Your best bet is to see the British Consul, er, in the city.' Erm, well this was on a Saturday afternoon and it was five o'clock and he told us that we would be able to get into the, er, Consul on Monday morning when they opened, which didn't encourage us too much. (Quite!) Then it suddenly struck us that somebody must have taken this money, at the garage, (Ah, of course) so back we went the garage (Mhm) and we thought that as we stood talking to the man asking 'Where do you go to the campsite?', someone else had obviously stolen our folder.


Tom: That was the last time you'd had it ...?


Mary: Yes, indeed, (Mm) you see, erm, that was the last time that we could all agree (Mm) that we must have had it. (Mhm) So, er, John distracted the man's attention and I went into the man's office and went all through his papers on his desk (laughter) looking for it. It was a sort of green-coloured folder (Yeah) which one should have found easily (Yeah) and it wasn't there. And then we saw an old woman across the road, sitting on a window-ledge, and I was sure she was sitting on our folder because something green was sticking out underneath her. And we had to try and work out some way of moving er, to see. And eventually we persuaded her by asking her to give us directions and she stood up to speak to us. But it wasn't our folder at all she was just sitting on a little green mat (Oh) obviously to keep herself clean. Erm ... and we were feeling pretty desperate by now, (I bet you were. Yeah) so back we went to the campsite and we were going to beg, 'Please, may we stay tonight and worry (Mm) about it tomorrow?' (Mm) you see. And when we got back they said, 'There's been a phone call. Would you go to this address? Er, someone has found your folder.' So ...


Tom: How would anybody who'd found your folder (have) phoned, the fact, the campsite?


Mary: Right. Well, this is what we discovered. We were w, worried, because someone might have found it (Mm) and we might get our passports, but what about our money, you know. (Quite, yeah) So we went to the address, (Mhm) and it was a little cycle-repair shop, kept by two brothers. And they told us that they had seen us driving up the road to the campsite. We had swung round a corner (Mm) and the folder had flown off the top of the car! (Cor) We'd obviously left it (Yes) there, at the garage. And it had fallen at their feet. (Good heavens!) They saw the tent and camping stuff (Yeah) on top of the car. (Mm) They saw which way we were going. (Mm) They guessed we were going to the campsite, because it (Mm) was just a country lane (Mm) and they telephoned! Weren't we lucky? And (Gosh!) when we got there they said, er, 'Would we check that everything (Mm) was there.' (Mm) And certainly everything was there, (mm) nothing gone. And we were so pleased, we'd only got one piece of, erm, French currency — it was on large-value (Mm) note (Mm) — a number of pounds. (Mm) Erm, and we knew that we had to live till Monday, (Yeah) so we asked them if they would change this note for us. Erm, and the man sent a small boy to another shop to get change (Yes) and he came back with two equal value notes, (Oh yes) he'd split it in half (Mm) if you like. So we gave them half (Yeah) and we went back to the campsite and put up our tent and installed ourselves and then we went out and spent the other half on a celebration. Erm, and er, of course, we had no money all day Sunday (Yes) and had to spend the day eating bread and si ...


Tom: But you felt rich, because you'd got everything back.


Mary: Indeed, we were so relieved ...


Tom: How terribly lucky, though! What a lucky story!


玛丽：在假期，一个夏天，我们当然在露营，（是的，当然）呃，去过意大利，呃，回到法国（是的），在边境，我们遇到了很多找不到护照和（嗯）这个那个，（嗯）从意大利搬到法国，嗯，所以我相当失望，因为我们把它弄得一团糟，当我们继续前往法国时法国，那天剩下的时间我都在整理车子（嗯），我非常小心地将护照、机票、旅行支票和我们所有的货币放进一个文件夹中（是的），而且它们都包装得很漂亮，这样我们就不会不要再陷入找不到（嗯，嗯）任何东西的境地。嗯，我们最终决定在一个小镇停下来，我们知道那里有一个露营地，在镇上我们在一个车库停下来，实际上是为了询问去露营地的路，（嗯）但当我们在那里时，我们想，好吧，我们我去买点汽油，呃，呃，同时问这个问题。 （是的）呃……那人把汽油放进车里，我高效地拿出了里面有钱的文件夹（是的），付了汽油费，然后我们就上路了。露营地距离大约两三英里。呃，当我们到达露营地时，我们走进办公室，作为露营者通常携带的东西之一是一张小卡片，呃，一张露营票，如果你愿意的话，而且，呃，我……​

汤姆：那是做什么用的？

玛丽：嗯，作为（哦，我明白了）露营俱乐部的会员，（嗯）或类似的会员可以享受折扣。嗯，我去文件夹中取出它，正确打包的文件夹，（嗯）但我找不到该文件夹​​！ （哦，天哪！）我们把所有东西都从车里拿出来，放在草地上的地板上，呃，我们每个人都确信我们，呃，从车库开始就在某个地方见过它。最后我们不得不对这些人说，‘我们非常抱歉，我们没有钱，没有卡，什么都没有’而且……​

汤姆：涉及多少钱？

玛丽：好吧，你知道，我们所有的假期钱。大约几百英镑，用旅行支票，还有一些用货币，你看，几英镑……​
  汤姆：护照呢？

玛丽：还有护照和船票（上帝！）嗯，所以我们说我们要去警察局。于是我们就回城里去了。我们都进了警察局。嗯，一位非常友好的警察说，‘好吧，我对此无能为力。你最好的选择是去见英国领事，呃，在城里。嗯，那是在周六下午，当时是五点钟，他告诉我们，呃，领事馆周一早上开门时我们就可以进去，这并没有给我们太大的鼓励。 （非常！）然后我们突然意识到一定有人在车库拿了这笔钱，（啊，当然）所以我们回到车库（嗯），我们认为当我们站着与那个人说话时问“在哪里”你去露营地吗？”，显然是其他人偷了我们的文件夹。

汤姆：那是你最后一次吃它……​？

玛丽：是的，确实，（嗯）你看，呃，那是我们最后一次同意（嗯）我们一定拥有它。 （嗯）所以，呃，约翰分散了那个人的注意力，我走进那个人的办公室，翻遍了他桌子上的文件（笑声）寻找它。这是一种绿色文件夹（是的），人们应该很容易找到（是的），但它不在那里。然后我们看到马路对面有一位老妇人，坐在窗台上，我确信她坐在我们的文件夹上，因为她下面有一些绿色的东西伸出来。我们必须尝试找出某种移动方式，呃，看看。最终我们请她给我们指路，说服了她，她站起来和我们说话。但这根本不是我们的文件夹，她只是坐在一个小绿色垫子上（哦），显然是为了保持自己的干净。嗯……我们现在感到非常绝望，（我敢打赌你是的。是的）所以我们回到露营地，我们会乞求，‘拜托，我们可以今晚留下来，明天担心（嗯）吗？ ' （嗯）你看。当我们回来时，他们说，‘接到电话了。你会去这个地址吗？呃，有人找到了你的文件夹。”所以……​

汤姆：找到你的文件夹的人会怎么给露营地打电话呢？

玛丽：对。嗯，这就是我们发现的。我们很担心，因为有人可能已经找到了它（嗯），我们可能会拿到护照，但是我们的钱呢，你知道的。 （是的，是的）所以我们去了那个地址，（嗯）那是一家小自行车修理店，由两兄弟经营。他们告诉我们，他们看到我们开车沿着路前往露营地。我们转过一个拐角（嗯），文件夹从车顶飞走了！ （Cor）我们显然把它留在了那里（是的），在车库里。它已经落在了他们的脚下。 （天哪！）他们看到了车顶上的帐篷和露营用品（是的）。 （嗯）他们看到了我们要走的路。 （嗯）他们猜我们要去露营地，因为那（嗯）只是一条乡村小路（嗯）他们打电话了！我们很幸运吗？ （天哪！）当我们到达那里时，他们说，呃，“我们要检查一下所有东西（嗯）都在那里吗？” （嗯）当然一切都在那里，（嗯）什么都没有消失。我们很高兴，我们只得到了一张，呃，法国货币——它是大面额（Mm）纸币（Mm）——几英镑。 （嗯）嗯，我们知道我们必须活到星期一，（是的）所以我们问他们是否愿意为我们更改这张纸条。嗯，那个男人派了一个小男孩去另一家商店找零钱（是的），他带着两张等值的纸币回来，（哦，是的）如果你愿意的话，他会把它分成两半（嗯）。所以我们给了他们一半（是的），然后我们回到露营地搭起帐篷并安顿好自己，然后我们出去庆祝另一半。呃，呃，当然，我们周日一整天都没有钱（是的），不得不花一天的时间吃面包和 si ...​

汤姆：但你感觉很富有，因为你得到了一切。

玛丽：确实，我们松了一口气……​

汤姆：不过，真是太幸运了！多么幸运的故事啊！

Lesley: Oh Jackie, I've had such a terrible day. You just won't believe.


Jackie: You look exhausted. What on earth have you been doing?


Lesley: Oh, I've been such a fool! (Oh) You just wouldn't believe what I've done.


Jackie: I would, I would. Come on ... (You won't) Where've you been?


Lesley: I'm dying to tell someone. I've been down to London (Uh-huh) you see. (Uh-huh) OK, I thought I'd be very sensible, so I'd drive down to the Underground on ... on the outskirts of London, leave the car and go in by Tube. All right? (Er ... what you) Very sensible. (Yes) Yes? (OK) OK. So I drove down to London (Uh-huh) and I parked my car by the Tube station and I got the Tube into London. (Uh-huh) Fine! All right? (Well, sounds like it) so far, so good. (Yes) Right. Came back out of London ... (Uh-huh ... and you er ... forgot the car?) Got out of the Tube. No, no, I didn't forget the car. (Oh) I couldn't find the car, Jackie. (You're joking) It'd gone. (You're kidding) No, no, really, it'd gone. I walked out ... happily out of the Tube, you know, over to where it was (Mm) and I looked and it was a red Mini and mine's green, so (Oh on!) I thought 'Oh no'. So having panicked a bit, I rang the police, you see, and this lovely, new little policeman ... a young one (Yes, all shiny and bright) came out to help. That's it yes ... buttons shining ... (Yes) big, smile ... came down to help, so I said 'I've lost my car. It's been stolen' and I took him to see it and everything and ...


Jackie: You mean where it wasn't.


Lesley: And sure enough, it wasn't ... yes, well, right ... and it wasn't there. And then he coughed a bit and he went very quiet ... (Oh dear) and he took me back into the Tube station (Oh dear) and out the other side into the other car park ... and there was my car, Jackie (Oh Lesley) parked in the other Tube station car park, the other side of the station, because there are two exits, you see, so I walked out of an exit (Yes) not knowing there were two and it was in the other one.


Jackie: Oh Lesley. And was he ever so cross?


Lesley: He was livid, Jackie. (Really) He really ... he went on and on at me and I didn't know what to do. It was (Oh dear) just frightful. I just ... I went red and just shut up and said 'Sorry' all the time.


Jackie: Jumped in your car and (Oh yes) and left.


Lesley: Oh, it was awful. I'm never doing that again ever.


莱斯利：噢，杰基，我今天过得很糟糕。你只是不会相信。

杰基：你看上去很疲惫。你到底在做什么？

莱斯利：哦，我真是个傻瓜！ （哦）你只是不会相信我所做的事。

杰基：我愿意，我愿意。来吧……（你不会）你去哪儿了？

莱斯利：我很想告诉别人。你看，我去过伦敦（嗯哼）。 （嗯哼）好吧，我想我会很明智，所以我会开车去伦敦郊区的地铁，下车然后乘坐地铁进去。好的？ （呃……​你什么）非常明智。 （是的是的？ （好的好的。所以我开车去了伦敦（嗯嗯），我把车停在地铁站旁边，然后乘地铁进入伦敦。 （嗯嗯）好吧！好的？ （嗯，听起来是这样）到目前为止，一切都很好。 （是）对。从伦敦回来......（嗯嗯......你呃......忘记了车？）出了地铁。不，不，我没有忘记车。 （哦）我找不到车，杰基。 （你在开玩笑）它消失了。 （你在开玩笑）不，不，真的，它消失了。我高兴地走出地铁，你知道，到了它所在的地方（嗯），我看了看，那是一辆红色的迷你车，而我的是绿色的，所以（哦！）我想“哦不”。所以有点惊慌之后，我给警察打电话，你看，这个可爱的新小警察……一个年轻的警察（是的，闪闪发亮）出来帮忙。就是这样，是的……按钮闪闪发光……（是的）大，微笑……下来帮忙，所以我说‘我丢了车。它被偷了”，我带他去看了它和所有东西，然后……​

杰基：你的意思是它不存在的地方。

莱斯利：果然，它不……是的，嗯，对……而且它不在那里。然后他咳嗽了一下，然后变得非常安静......（哦天哪）他带我回到地铁站（哦天哪）然后从另一边到另一个停车场......还有我的车，杰基（哦莱斯利）把车停在另一个地铁站停车场，车站的另一边，因为有两个出口，你看，所以我走出一个出口（是的）不知道有两个出口，而且在另一个出口。

杰基：跳进你的车然后（哦，是的）离开了。

莱斯利：哦，太糟糕了。我再也不会这样做了。

Today we're going to look at some aspects of life — or perhaps it would be more correct to say 'death' in Ancient Egypt.





Egypt has always fascinated ordinary people as well as scholars engaged in the serious study of the past. To most of us it's a land of mystery and magic. In particular, the custom of preserving the bodies of important people, especially of kings and queens, has quite a hold on the popular imagination. How many thrillers and horror films are based on the idea of finding a mummy in the secret tomb of a lost king, who in the case of horror movies usually comes to life again!





In earlier times the subject exerted a more sinister fascination — so-called 'mummy dust' — the powdered remains of dead Egyptians — was thought to be an essential ingredient in many magical spells and medical remedies — a case of the cure being worse than the disease?





This of course led to a great demand for mummies both inside and outside Egypt, and even to an industry of making 'false mummies' to sell to unsuspecting foreigners. This continued well into the 19th century. Even when, at that time, tighter controls were exerted by the Egyptian authorities, many mummies were still sold on the Black Market, and even some of the mummies that were acquired for museums for scientific purposes were bought clandestinely.





These days, archaeologists and anthropologists have more moral scruples about the way they treat the dead — even those who have been dead for thousands of years. That's one reason why — even though new techniques of analysis can reveal fascinating information, there is some hesitation about carrying out 'autopsies' on too many mummies in an indiscriminate way. Besides the ethical question, there is the practical one that any analysis must involve at least some degree of destruction.





The studies that have been made in recent years have therefore for the most part been of mummies which were already in poor state of preservation, and the investigators have tried to do the minimum damage possible — taking only tiny samples of tissue for analysis, or using non-destructive means of study such as X-rays.





At the end of each study, it is now customary to restore the mummy to a state of 'decent burial'. In this way, the scientists involved have tried to satisfy both their curiosity and their consciences.





In a moment, I'm going to ask Dr Albert Simons, a noted expert on Egyptian archaeology, to give us an overview of some recent studies and what they have revealed ...

今天我们要看看生命的某些方面——或者也许在古埃及说“死亡”更正确。


埃及一直让普通民众以及认真研究过去的学者着迷。对于我们大多数人来说，这是一片神秘而神奇的土地。特别是，保存重要人物，尤其是国王和王后尸体的习俗，在大众的想象中占有相当大的影响力。有多少惊悚片和恐怖片都是基于在失落国王的秘密坟墓中找到木乃伊的想法，而在恐怖电影中，木乃伊通常会复活！


在早期，这个主题发挥了一种更险恶的魅力——所谓的“木乃伊灰尘”——死去的埃及人的粉末状遗骸——被认为是许多魔法咒语和医疗疗法的重要成分——这种治疗方法比传统方法更糟糕。疾病？


这当然导致了埃及国内外对木乃伊的巨大需求，甚至催生了制作“假木乃伊”并出售给毫无戒心的外国人的行业。这种情况一直持续到 19 世纪。即使当时埃及当局实行更严格的控制，黑市上仍然有许多木乃伊出售，甚至一些博物馆出于科学目的而收购的木乃伊也是秘密购买的。


如今，考古学家和人类学家对他们对待死者的方式有了更多的道德顾虑——即使是那些已经死了数千年的人。这就是为什么——尽管新的分析技术可以揭示令人着迷的信息，但人们对于不加区别地对太多木乃伊进行“尸检”仍有些犹豫。除了道德问题之外，还有一个实际问题，即任何分析都必须至少涉及某种程度的破坏。


因此，近年来进行的研究大部分都是针对保存状况不佳的木乃伊，研究人员试图将损害降到最低——仅采集微小的组织样本进行分析，或者使用非破坏性研究手段，例如 X 射线。


现在，在每次研究结束时，通常都会将木乃伊恢复到“体面的埋葬”状态。通过这种方式，参与其中的科学家们试图满足他们的好奇心和良心。


稍后，我将请埃及考古学著名专家阿尔伯特·西蒙斯博士为我们概述一些最近的研究以及它们所揭示的内容……​

== Burglaries



The figures for burglaries have risen alarmingly over the last few years and are now quite appalling. Let me quote you a few statistics about break-ins.





A house is burgled in Britain now about every two minutes, and over the past three years the number of burglaries reported to the police has risen by approximately 50,000 to well over 400,000 this year. The insurance companies report that last year alone household burglary losses rose by 27 per cent over the previous year to ￡138.2 million, and I believe one or two companies are refusing to provide burglary cover in what we might call high-risk areas.





There are, nevertheless, half a dozen measures which can be taken against burglaries, which I will briefly outline for you. It really only requires some basic common sense and a small outlay, combined with a little knowledge of the way a burglar thinks and operates. You have to put yourself in his position, really. Most burglars are opportunists looking for an easy break-in, so don't make things simple for them. Don't advertise the fact you're out or away, or be careless about security. Even if you're just popping out for a quarter of an hour, don't leave doors and windows open or unlocked. A burglary can take less than ten minutes.





This time element leads me to my second main point, that where a house is hard to get into and will take a long time to do so because you've fitted good locks and bolts on your exterior doors and windows or even burglar alarms, the chances are that the burglar will move on to somewhere easier. There are plenty of these, I can assure you. Milk bottles left on the doorstep, papers by the front door, garage doors wide open, curtains drawn in the daytime or un-drawn at night are all indications. For comparatively little you can buy a programmed time-switch that'll turn on and off a light at appropriate times.





Not all burglaries happen while you are out, of course. You should always be wary of callers at the door who say, for example, that they've come to read the gas meter; always check their credentials, and if in doubt don't let them in. It's also a good idea to keep a record of serial numbers on electrical equipment, radios, TVs and so on, or even to take photographs of valuable jewellery, antiques or pictures.





Any further tips I may not have mentioned can always be got from your local police station, where you should ask to speak to the Crime Prevention Officer.





In the final analysis I think I should say that when it comes to fitting security systems and the like you've really got to strike a balance between the cost of what you spend on installing the system and the value of the property you're trying to protect.

入室盗窃

过去几年，入室盗窃的数字惊人地上升，现在更是令人震惊。让我向您引用一些有关入室盗窃的统计数据。


英国现在大约每两分钟就有一所房屋被盗，过去三年向警方报告的入室盗窃案数量增加了约 50,000 起，今年远远超过 400,000 起。保险公司报告称，仅去年一年，家庭入室盗窃损失就比前一年增加了 27%，达到 1.382 亿英镑，而且我相信有一两家公司拒绝在我们所谓的高风险地区提供入室盗窃保险。


尽管如此，还是可以采取六种措施来防止入室盗窃，我将向您简要概述这些措施。它实际上只需要一些基本常识和少量支出，再加上对窃贼思维和操作方式的一点了解。你必须把自己放在他的位置上，真的。大多数窃贼都是机会主义者，他们想轻易闯入，所以不要让他们的事情变得简单。不要宣传您外出或离开的事实，或者不注意安全。即使您只是出去一刻钟，也不要打开门窗或未上锁。入室盗窃可能需要不到十分钟。


这个时间因素引出了我的第二个要点，即如果房子很难进入并且需要很长时间才能进入，因为你在外门窗上安装了良好的锁和螺栓，甚至防盗警报器，窃贼很可能会转移到更容易的地方。我可以向你保证，这样的东西有很多。留在门口台阶上的牛奶瓶、前门旁的文件、敞开的车库门、白天拉上或晚上没有拉上的窗帘都是迹象。您可以花费相对较少的钱购买一个可编程的时间开关，它可以在适当的时间打开和关闭灯。


当然，并非所有入室盗窃都发生在您外出时。你应该时刻警惕门口的打电话者，他们会说，例如，他们来查煤气表；务必检查他们的证件，如有疑问，请勿让他们进入。记录电气设备、收音机、电视等的序列号，甚至拍摄贵重珠宝、古董或物品的照片也是个好主意。图片。


我可能没有提到的任何进一步提示都可以从您当地的警察局获得，您应该要求与犯罪预防官员交谈。


归根结底，我认为我应该说，在安装安全系统等方面，您确实必须在安装系统的成本与您尝试的财产的价值之间取得平衡保护。
