Lesson 12 +


== 1

Gentleman Jim has *worked out a plan* 制定计划 to rob a bank. He's *telling* his gang, Fingers Jones and Ginger Robertson *about* the plan. Listen to their conversation. +


Fingers: Let's see. You're going to walk up the counter 柜台 and you're going to start writing a cheque. Then you're going to open *the canister （装茶叶、咖啡等有盖的）小罐 of nerve gas*, and everyone will go to sleep instantly. +

====

Jim: That's right. This gas will put anyone to sleep for exactly three minutes. +

Fingers: And while everyone is asleep, you're going to go round to the manager's desk and steal all the money? +

Jim: Exactly. I've *worked it out* 计划；思考 very carefully. There should be about ￡50,000 in used *bank notes* 钞票. +

Ginger: Sounds great. There's only one thing. If you open the gas, you'll go to sleep too, won't you? +

Jim: I have thought of that. I'll wear a motor-cycle 摩托车 helmet, with an oxygen mask inside. If I wear a helmet, no one will be able to recognize me afterwards, either. +

Ginger: I think it's risky. If the bank clerk 职员；簿记员；文书 sees you take out a gas canister, he won't wait. He'll push the alarm button *straight away*. +

Fingers: I've just had an idea. If I came into the bank when you were standing at the counter, no one would even look at me. Then, if I threw the can of nerve gas, they wouldn't guess that we were connected. +

Ginger: Yes, that might be better. Are you going to wear a helmet, too? +

Fingers: No. It would look very suspicious if two people were wearing motor cycle helmets. I'll just open the door, throw in the gas canister, and leave Gentleman Jim to rob the bank. +

Jim: I like that idea. Right, we'll do that. Any other problems that you can see? +


Ginger: What are you going to do with the money? If you walk out with ￡50,000 under your arm, somebody will surely notice you. +

Jim: You'll be sitting in a get-away 离开;外出度假;使逃跑; 逃跑 car, waiting for me outsaid the bank. +

Ginger: But there is a police station just fifty yards away. If I park a car outside the bank, the police would probably come and ask me to move. +

Fingers: Well, what do you suggest? He can't just walk around 四处走动；绕走 the town. He'll be carrying ￡50,000 in bundles of bank notes. +


Jim: Just a minute! I've thought of something. What day is this robbery 盗窃；抢劫；掠夺? +

Fingers: Monday. +

Jim: Monday! You know what happens on Monday, don't you? It's dustbin  （常置于房外的）垃圾桶，垃圾箱 day! +

Ginger: So? +

Jim: So, can you think of a better way of moving the money? If you saw a man pick up ￡50,000 and put it into a car, what would you think? +

Fingers: I'd think he was a thief. +

Jim: Exactly. But if you saw a man pick up a dustbin and put it into a lorry 卡车；货运汽车, what would you think? +

Fingers: I'd think he was a dustman. Hey! That's clever! +

Ginger: And if the ￡50,000 was in the dustbin, I could pick up the money and nobody would notice. That's brilliant 巧妙的；使人印象深的;聪颖的；技艺高的. +

Fingers: Is there a dustbin? +

Jim: Oh yes, several. They put the dustbins out every Monday. They'll be standing there, outside the bank. +

Fingers: But if you put the money in a dustbin, it'll stink (v.)有臭味；有难闻的气味. We'll never be able to spend it if it smells like that. +

Jim: We don't have to put it in a dustbin. We can put it in a black plastic bag. They often have black plastic bags for rubbish nowadays. If I carry one in my pocket, I can *pull it out* after you've thrown the gas. OK? Let's *run through* 快速浏览;过一遍;排练 the plan once more. +


Ginger: You go into the bank with a motor-cycle helmet on, and a black rubbish bag in your pocket. +

Fingers: I come in a few minutes later. I open the door, throw in the open gas canister, and then go ... where? +

Jim: I've hired  租用；租借 a room in the building *right opposite* the bank. *Go up* in the lift *to* the top floor /and *keep a look out* 留意，注意. When you get there, radio (v.)（用无线电）发送，传送 Ginger, and tell him to come. +

Ginger: In the meantime, everyone in the bank has gone to sleep, except you. You take the money, and put it in the plastic bag. +

Jim: I come out, and put the bag with the rubbish, and then go back into the bank. +

Ginger: Go back? +

Jim：Oh yes. If everyone woke up and I wasn't there, they'd know I was one of the thieves. No, I'll go back and pretend to wake up with everyone else. +

Fingers: That's a really clever touch 修饰；润色；装点;作风；风格；手法. +

Ginger: I drive a dustcart and wait in the cul-de-sac 死胡同；死巷 behind the bank until Fingers contacts me. Then I come and pick up the rubbish, including the ￡50,000. +

Jim: I can't think of any problems, can you?


.案例

.touch
a way or style of doing sth 作风；风格；手法 +

吉姆绅士制定了抢劫银行的计划。他正在向他的帮派手指琼斯和金杰·罗伯逊讲述这个计划。听听他们的谈话。 +

手指：让我们看看。您将走到柜台并开始写一张支票。然后你将打开神经毒气罐，每个人都会立即进入睡眠状态。 +

吉姆：没错。这种气体可以让任何人睡足三分钟。 +

Fingers：趁大家都睡了的时候，你要跑到经理办公桌前偷走所有的钱？ +

吉姆：没错。我已经非常仔细地解决了。用过的纸币应该有5万英镑左右。 +

姜：听起来很棒。只有一件事。如果你打开煤气，你也会去睡觉，不是吗？ +

吉姆：我已经想到了。我会戴上摩托车头盔，里面有氧气面罩。如果我戴上头盔，以后也没有人能认出我。 +

姜：我认为这是有风险的。如果银行职员看到你拿出煤气罐，他不会等待。他会立即按下警报按钮。 +

手指：我刚刚有了一个主意。如果当你站在柜台时我走进银行，没有人会看我一眼。然后，如果我扔掉一罐神经毒气，他们就不会猜到我们有联系。 +

金杰：是的，这样可能会更好。你也要戴头盔吗？ +

Fingers：没有。如果两个人都戴着摩托车头盔，就会显得很可疑。我就打开门，扔进煤气罐，然后让吉姆先生去抢劫银行。 +

吉姆：我喜欢这个主意。好的，我们会这么做的。您还可以看到其他问题吗？ +

姜：你打算用这些钱做什么？如果你腋下夹着5万英镑走出去，肯定会有人注意到你。 +

吉姆：你会坐在一辆逃亡车里，在银行外面等我。 +

金杰：但是五十码外就有一个警察局。如果我把车停在银行外面，警察可能会过来叫我走开。 +

手指：嗯，你有什么建议？他不能只是在城里走来走去。他将携带一捆捆价值 5 万英镑的钞票。 +

吉姆：等一下！我想到了一件事。这次抢劫是哪一天？ +

  手指：周一。 +

吉姆：星期一！你知道周一会发生什么，不是吗？今天是垃圾箱日！ +

  姜：所以呢？ +

吉姆：那么，你能想出更好的转移资金的方法吗？如果你看到一个人捡起5万英镑放进车里，你会怎么想？ +

Fingers：我认为他是个小偷。 +

吉姆：没错。但如果你看到一个人捡起一个垃圾箱并将其放入卡车，你会怎么想？ +

手指：我认为他是一名清洁工。嘿！太聪明了！ +

Ginger：如果 50,000 英镑在垃圾箱里，我可以捡起这笔钱，没有人会注意到。太精彩了。 +

手指：有垃圾箱吗？ +

吉姆：哦，是的，有几个。他们每周一都会把垃圾箱倒掉。他们会站在银行外面。 +

手指：但是如果你把钱放进垃圾箱，它就会发臭。如果闻起来像那样的话，我们就永远无法花掉它。 +

吉姆：我们不必把它扔进垃圾箱。我们可以把它放在一个黑色的塑料袋里。现在他们经常用黑色塑料袋装垃圾。如果我口袋里有一个，我可以在你放完汽油后把它拿出来。好的？让我们再次回顾一下这个计划。 +

金杰：你戴着摩托车头盔走进银行，口袋里揣着一个黑色垃圾袋。 +

Fingers：几分钟后我就进来了。我打开门，把打开的煤气罐扔进去，然后去……​哪里？ +

吉姆：我在银行对面的大楼里租了一个房间。乘电梯到顶层并留意观察。当你到达那里时，给金杰发无线电，告诉他来。 +

金杰：与此同时，银行里的每个人都已经睡觉了，除了你。你拿着钱，把它放进塑料袋里。 +

吉姆：我出来，把垃圾放进袋子里，然后回到银行。 +

  姜：回去吗？ +

吉姆：哦，是的。如果每个人都醒来而我不在场，他们就会知道我是小偷之一。不，我要回去假装和其他人一起醒来。 +

手指：这是一个非常聪明的触摸。 +

金杰：我开着一辆垃圾车，在银行后面的死胡同里等着，直到手指联系我。然后我就来捡垃圾，包括那5万英镑。 +

吉姆：我想不出任何问题，你能吗？ +

老板：终于来了！为什么你花了这么长时间？ +

第二个恶棍：我们快到了，老大。不管怎样，我们跑到了第二辆车停的地方，在牛巷的图书馆外面——你知道，我们要在那里换车——然后——你知道，这真是令人难以置信—— +

第一个恶棍：——是的。我们开车沿着教堂巷行驶，但他们正在教堂旁边挖路，所以我们不得不走左边的岔路，一直绕着公园的北侧走。然后，就在伦敦路环岛之前—— +

第二个恶棍：——肯定是有个白痴从火车站驶出，根本没看向右边就撞上了一辆卡车。整条路都被堵住了。 +

1. The American Indians of the Southwest have led an agricultural life since the year 1 A.D., and in some aspects their life is still similar today. +

2. At the beginning of this period, the people farmed on the tops of high, flat, mountain plateaus 高原, called mesas 桌子山，方山（常见于美国西南部）. Mesa is the Spanish word for table. +

4. In their early history, the Anasazi used baskets for all these purposes. Later they developed pottery 陶器（尤指手工制的）. But the change from basketmaking 篮子编织 to pottery was *so* important *that* it began a series of secondary changes 次生变化，继发性变化. +

5. To cook food in a basket, the women first *filled* the basket *with* ground  磨细的；磨碎的 corn （小麦等）谷物；谷粒 mixed with water. They then built a fire. +

6. But many stones could be heated on the fire and then dropped into the basket of food, so it would cook. The stones heated the food quite well, but soon they 指石头 had to be taken out of the food and heated again. +

7. But although the men *brought home* 使某人明白,使某人深刻认识到 the idea of pottery, they did not bring home any instructions on how to make it. Anthropologists 人类学家 have discovered pieces of broken pottery 后定 made according to different formulas. +

8. Because the Anasazi had solved the problem of cooking and storing food, they could now enjoy a more prosperous 繁荣的；成功的；兴旺的, comfortable period of life.

阿纳齐族人是印第安人种族。科罗拉多西南部的维德台地, 是印第安人阿纳萨齐族（Anasazi）人早期的定居点之一，他们于公元6世纪的时来到这里，人们还能看到当时的一些建筑物的遗址。13世纪突然离开。

.bring home
To make perfectly clear: 使…十分清楚： +


- a lecture *that brought home several important points* 清楚地解释了几个要点的讲座

.bring home to sb/sth
- A teacher *should bring home to children* the value and pleasure of reading. 老师应当使儿童懂得读书的重要性和乐趣。
- Its importance *has been brought home to me very strongly*. 我已深刻地认识到它的重要性。

.bring home to sb.
- The story that I heard *that brought home to me the message* 后定 how important psychology is to wellbeing and to success. 那个故事让我明白, 心理学对幸福和成功是多么重要。

====

西南部的美洲印第安人从公元1年起就过着农业生活，在某些方面他们的生活在今天仍然相似。 +

在这个时期的初期，人们在高而平坦的山地高原（称为台地）的顶部耕作。 Mesa 是西班牙语，意为“桌子”。 +

他们居住在台地顶部或悬崖两侧洞穴的保护下。 +

在他们的早期历史中，阿纳萨齐人将篮子用于所有这些目的。后来他们又发展了陶器。但从编篮到陶器的转变是如此重要，以致于它开始了一系列次要的变化。 +

为了在篮子里煮食物，妇女们首先在篮子里装满磨碎的玉米和水。然后他们生了火。 +

但许多石头可以放在火上加热，然后扔进食物篮子里，这样食物就会煮熟。石头很好地加热了食物，但很快就必须将它们从食物中取出并再次加热。 +

然而，尽管这些人带回了陶器的想法，但他们并没有带回任何有关如何制作陶器的说明。人类学家发现了根据不同配方制成的破碎陶器碎片。 +

由于阿纳萨齐人解决了烹饪和储存食物的问题，他们现在可以享受更加繁荣、舒适的生活。 +

The Chinese believe that there are special energy lines through the body and that the body's energy runs through these lines. When a person is ill the energy in his or her body does not run as well as normal, perhaps because it is weaker or it is blocked in some way. The Chinese believe that if you put very fine needles into the energy line, this helps the energy to return to normal. In this way the body can help itself to get better. +

扁桃体炎 +

*由于细菌及分泌物积存于扁桃体窝导致的。致病菌主要为"链球菌"或者"葡萄球菌"。* +

患急性传染病（如猩红热、麻疹、流感、白喉等）后，可引起慢性扁桃体炎，鼻腔有鼻窦感染也可伴发本病。病源菌以链球菌及葡萄球菌等最常见。临床表现为经常咽部不适，异物感，发干、痒，刺激性咳嗽，口臭等症状。

The acupuncturist puts the needles into special places along the energy line and some of these places can be a long way from the place where the body is ill. For example it is possible to treat a bad headache by putting needles into certain places on the foot. *It may surprise you to know that* it does not hurt when the acupuncturist puts the needles into your body. People who have had acupuncture say that they felt nothing or hardly anything. Western doctors at first did not believe that acupuncture could work. Now they see that it not only can work but that it does work. How and why does it work? No one has been able to explain this. It is one of nature's mysteries.


针灸 +

当今西方世界使用多种形式的替代医学。其中最著名的是针灸，这是一种来自中国的非常古老的治疗方法。如今，它在中国仍然被广泛使用，据说可以治愈许多疾病，包括扁桃体炎、关节炎、支气管炎、风湿病和流感。中国人认为，身体有特殊的能量线，身体的能量通过这些线运行。当一个人生病时，他或她体内的能量无法正常运行，可能是因为它较弱或以某种方式被阻塞。中国人相信，如果将非常细的针插入能量线，这有助于能量恢复正常。这样身体就可以帮助自己变得更好。 +

针灸师将针沿着能量线刺入特殊的地方，其中一些地方可能距离身体患病的地方很远。例如，可以通过将针刺入脚的某些部位来治疗严重头痛。您可能会惊讶地发现，当针灸师将针刺入您的身体时，您并不会感到疼痛。接受过针灸治疗的人表示，他们没有任何感觉或几乎没有任何感觉。西方医生起初并不相信针灸有效。现在他们发现它不仅可以发挥作用，而且确实有效。它如何以及为什么起作用？没有人能够解释这一点。这是大自然的奥秘之一。 +
