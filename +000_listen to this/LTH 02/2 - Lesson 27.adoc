Lesson 27



== part



Interviewer: I understand you're interested in holistic medicine. Can you explain what holistic medicine is?


Vivienne: OK. Holistic medicine, um, takes into consideration the whole of the person. Now what this means in, in most holistic systems is regarding the person as a physical entity, a mental or emotional person, and also even their spiritual side of them. Um, it also includes looking at the body as a whole rather than looking at individual parts of the body, and as a way of explaining this, we could look at conventional medicine as producing people who are like a cardiologist, who looks at a heart, um, a brain specialist, a person who deals with bones, er, etc. So what we've tended to do in conventional medicine is break things down to a point where we're actually only looking at one part of the person and we're not actually relating terribly well that part to the rest of the body, whereas holistic medicine insists that if there is a problem, er, with your right foot, that is going to somehow, um, affect your entire body.


Interiewer: Um, your speciality is acupuncture. Er, is that a part of holistic medicine?


Vivienne: Acupuncture is very much a holistic system. Um, traditionally the Chinese regarded the person very much as a whole entity and acupuncture itself works on an energy system basically, and in a very simplified way, it's saying that, er, you have an energy system within your body and when that energy becomes blocked or tainted in some way, then you will manifest certain symptoms and the things that we look at in conventional medicine as things like arthritis or rheumatism are, to the Chinese, merely an imbalance of the energy. So, in this way, they may say to you, well, yes, you have rheumatoid arthritis but we're going to actually look at your energy balance and rebalance you, and, as a result, your symptoms should disappear.


Interviewer: Um, is acupuncture essentially a form of preventative medicine?


Vivienne: Traditionally, it was, very much. Um, in fact, traditionally, in China, people only used to pay the doctor while they were well and they used to go to their doctor fairly regularly on, you know, maybe four or five times a year, and they would only pay the doctor when they were kept well. And if they got sick, they didn't pay the doctor. And the doctor had various methods of which acupuncture was one, diet was another, exercise was another, er, of ensuring that the person lived a right life style and their emphasis was on if you're living a right life style, if you're living in tune with the laws of the universe, going to sleep when it's dark, waking up when it's light, working, resting, doing all these things properly, then you won't get sick. Unfortunately, our way of looking at life in the West is very different in that we tend to struggle on in spite of our headache and not take terribly much notice of our body when things are not quite right and we tend to struggle on until we fall over and we get carted off to hospital in an ambulance. And so, acupuncture in the West, unfortunately, in a way, has come to be not the preventative medicine that it could be because we're not taking responsibility enough for ourselves in going along and making sure that we stay well.


采访者：我知道您对整体医学感兴趣。您能解释一下什么是整体医学吗？

薇薇安：好的。整体医学，嗯，考虑到人的整体。现在，在大多数整体系统中，这意味着将人视为一个物理实体、一个精神或情感的人，甚至是他们的精神层面。嗯，它还包括将身体视为一个整体，而不是观察身体的各个部分，作为解释这一点的一种方式，我们可以将传统医学视为培养像心脏病专家一样的人，他们会观察心脏，嗯，一位大脑专家，一个处理骨骼的人，呃，等等。所以我们在传统医学中倾向于做的是将事情分解到我们实际上只关注人的一个部分并且事实上，我们并没有很好地将该部分与身体的其他部分联系起来，而整体医学坚持认为，如果你的右脚有问题，呃，那会以某种方式，嗯，影响你的整个身体。

Interiewer：嗯，你的专长是针灸。呃，这是整体医学的一部分吗？

Vivienne：针灸在很大程度上是一个整体系统。嗯，传统上中国人将人视为一个整体，而针灸本身基本上是在一个能量系统上起作用，以一种非常简单的方式，它是说，呃，你体内有一个能量系统，当这个能量变成如果受到某种方式的阻塞或污染，那么你就会表现出某些症状，而我们在传统医学中所看到的疾病，如关节炎或风湿病，对中国人来说，只是能量的不平衡。因此，通过这种方式，他们可能会对你说，嗯，是的，你患有类风湿性关节炎，但我们将实际检查你的能量平衡并重新平衡你，结果，你的症状应该消失。

采访者：嗯，针灸本质上是一种预防医学吗？

Vivienne：从传统上来说，确实如此。嗯，事实上，传统上，在中国，人们只在身体健康时才付钱看医生，而且他们过去经常去看医生，你知道，可能一年四到五次，而且他们只会付钱当他们保持良好时医生。如果他们生病了，他们也不付钱给医生。医生有各种各样的方法，其中针灸是一种，饮食是另一种，运动是另一种，呃，以确保人们过上正确的生活方式，他们的重点是如果你过着正确的生活方式，如果你'顺应宇宙法则生活，天黑了就睡觉，天亮了就起床，工作、休息，把这一切都做好，你就不会生病。不幸的是，我们看待西方生活的方式非常不同，因为我们倾向于在头痛的情况下继续奋斗，而当情况不太对劲时，我们倾向于继续奋斗，直到摔倒。结束了，我们被救护车送往医院。因此，不幸的是，在某种程度上，西方的针灸已经不再是一种预防性药物，因为我们没有对自己承担足够的责任来继续前进并确保我们保持健康。

Janice: So you really believe that clothes carry a kind of message for other people and that what we put on is in some way a reflection of what we feel?


Pauline: Oh yes, very much so. People are beginning now to take seriously the idea of a kind of psychology of clothing, to believe that there is not just individual taste in our clothes but also a thinking behind what we wear which is trying to express something we may not even be aware of ourselves.


Janice: But surely this has always been the case. We all dress up when we want to impress someone, such as for a job interview with a prospective employer; we tend to make an effort and put on something smart.


Pauline: True, but that's a conscious act. What I'm talking about is more of a subconscious thing. Take for example the student who is away from home at college or university: if he tends to wrap himself up more than the others, this is because he is probably feeling homesick. Similarly, a general feeling of insecurity can sometimes take the form of over-dressing in warmer clothes than are necessary.


Janice: Can you give any other examples of this kind?


Pauline: Yes. I think people who are sociable and outgoing tend to dress in an extrovert way, preferring brighter or more dazzling colours — yellows, bright reds, and so on. In the same way, what might be seen as a parallel with the animal kingdom, aggressive clothes might indicate an aggressive personality or attitude to life. Think about the threat displays used by animals when they want to warn off opponents.


Janice: Do you think the care — or lack of it — over the way we actually wear our clothes has anything to tell us?


Pauline: Yes, indeed. The length, for example, of a man's trousers speaks volumes about his awareness of his own image. Or, if his trousers are at half-mast, all sort of hanging down, this probably means he's absorbed by other things.


Janice: Really.


Pauline: Or, to give you other examples, often minority groups, who have perhaps failed to persuade with words, tend to express themselves by wearing unconventional, or what some might consider outrageous clothing, as a way of showing their thoughts and feelings are different from the rest, and so they find an outlet in this way.


Janice: That surely spills over into other things as well.


Pauline: Oh yes, indeed. Haircuts, jewellery, kinds of fabric used — these things can all be a form of rebellion. But to get back to clothes, I would like to add that a whole lot about our personality is conveyed in our clothes and the way we look — aggressiveness, rebelliousness, happiness, sadness, and so on. These can all be interpreted. Think of the ageing pop star who may be pushing middle age, he'll keep on dressing up like a rebel to try to prove he's 'with it' still, and in touch with his young fans and current trends.


Janice: Do you think that at work clothes and general appearance have any significance?


Pauline: Definitely. We've already spoken about job interviews a bit, and it's interesting to note that in a recent survey it was suggested that employers prefer young executives to stick to grey, black and dark blue suits if they are men, and classical outfits and dresses in sober colours if they are women, perhaps because they feel this is a reflection of a more responsible and sober attitude to work and will also project this image to customers.


Janice: Do you subscribe to this opinion?


Pauline: I personally think that too much conservatism defeats the object of the clothes industry. They want to create new fashions and colour to sell clothes, so I can't really say that I go along wholeheartedly with it. There should be room for manoeuvre, leaving people scope to express their individuality in what they are wearing.





珍妮丝：所以你真的相信衣服向其他人传达了一种信息，而我们穿的衣服在某种程度上反映了我们的感受？

宝琳：哦，是的，非常如此。人们现在开始认真对待服装心理学的概念，相信我们的衣服不仅有个人品味，而且还有我们穿着背后的思考，它试图表达一些我们甚至可能没有意识到的东西我们自己。

珍妮丝：但确实情况一直如此。当我们想要给某人留下深刻印象时，例如去面试未来的雇主时，我们都会盛装打扮；我们倾向于做出努力并穿上一些聪明的衣服。

Pauline：确实如此，但这是一种有意识的行为。我所说的更多的是潜意识的事情。以离家在外的大学生为例：如果他比其他人更倾向于把自己包裹得更紧，这可能是因为他想家了。同样，普遍的不安全感有时会表现为穿得过多、过分保暖的衣服。

珍妮丝：你还能举出其他类似的例子吗？

宝琳：是的。我认为善于交际、外向的人倾向于外向的着装，喜欢更明亮或更耀眼的颜色——黄色、鲜红色等等。同样，攻击性的衣服可能与动物王国相似，可能表明攻击性的个性或生活态度。想想动物在警告对手时所使用的威胁表现。

珍妮丝：你认为我们对实际穿衣方式的关心（或缺乏关心）能告诉我们什么吗？

宝琳：是的，确实如此。例如，一个男人裤子的长度就足以说明他对自己形象的认识。或者，如果他的裤子下半旗，有点垂下来，这可能意味着他正在忙于其他事情。
 珍妮丝：真的。

Pauline：或者，举个其他例子，少数群体往往无法用语言说服他们，倾向于通过穿着非常规的服装来表达自己，或者一些人可能认为令人难以忍受的服装，以此来表达他们的想法和感受是不同的。与其他人不同，所以他们通过这种方式找到一个出口。

珍妮丝：这肯定也会影响到其他事情。

宝琳：哦，是的，确实如此。发型、珠宝、使用的各种布料——这些东西都可以是叛逆的一种形式。但回到衣服上，我想补充一点，我们的性格很大程度上是通过我们的衣服和我们的外表来传达的——攻击性、叛逆性、快乐、悲伤等等。这些都可以解读。想想那些可能已经步入中年的流行歌星，他会继续打扮得像个叛逆者，试图证明他仍然“坚持下去”，并与他的年轻歌迷和当前的趋势保持联系。

珍妮丝：你认为工作服装和整体仪表有什么意义吗？

宝琳：当然。我们已经谈过一些关于工作面试的问题，有趣的是，在最近的一项调查中，雇主更喜欢年轻管理人员在男性中穿灰色、黑色和深蓝色西装，而穿着古典服装和连衣裙。如果她们是女性，则可能会选择清醒的颜色，也许是因为她们觉得这是一种更负责任、更清醒的工作态度的体现，也会将这种形象投射给顾客。

珍妮丝：你同意这个观点吗？

Pauline：我个人认为，太多的保守主义违背了服装行业的目标。他们想创造新的时尚和颜色来销售衣服，所以我不能说我全心全意地同意。应该有回旋的余地，让人们可以通过穿着表达自己的个性。

We've all seen them on TV commercials, looking out at us from the covers of glossy magazines or showing off the latest creations from Paris, and it must have seemed to us that they have lives which are all glamour. Jeffrey Ingrams has been delving into the world of the fashion model and has come up with some interesting facts.


Denise: The average model can earn roughly the same as a top secretary on the basis, that is, that she's a freelance with an agent who'll send her out for auditions and interviews and get work for her.


Jeffrey: Denise Harper is a model agent. The Central Model Agency, in which she's a partner, is very closely associated with the Metropolitan Academy of Modelling, where dozens of aspiring models have come over the years to pay their money to take a basic course in the techniques of being a model. Just over five years ago, one such aspiring model was eighteen-year-old Margaret Connor, fresh from school.


Margaret: Your mother has told you that you're a pretty girl and you think that you're God's gift. You're not, of course, but the Academy give you the works, how to do make-up, how to walk, how to do your hair, dress sense, the lot.


Jeffrey: Now before we go any further I really ought to give you some idea of what Margaret looks like. She's about 5 feet 8 inches tall, with shoulder-length auburn hair, hazel eyes and a ready smile. Like Margaret, every model has her index card which potential clients can keep in their files to refer to. When not working, Margaret is a rather prettier-than-average girl-next-door, but her photograph alone seemed to show that she can be as versatile and as fashionable as anyone might want. But why did Denise Harper pick her out from the other similar applicants for the modelling course at the Academy?


Denise: I always look for personality, poise, good height and, very important, initiative, all of which Margaret has. You try to find above all a girl who you think will work and is not only in it for the money.


Jeffrey: Naturally, when they've finished the course it doesn't always mean automatically that they are set for stardom. Margaret occasionally gives classes at the Academy and she told me why some girls just pack in the job.


Margaret: Sometimes the work is too hard, sometimes it's too scarce and sometimes you have to push yourself too much. You've got to be a saleswoman to be a model, just sitting back and thinking you're going to be cosseted is no good, you've got to go out there and get work. But once you've got it, OK, fine.


Jeffrey: When work does come along, it could be pretty well anything.


Margaret: Really it's a different job every time — it might be TV advertisements, live advertising promotions, a photo session, anything.


Jeffrey: I asked Margaret to give me some idea of a typical day in her life.


Margaret: This is the fun thing about it, really. You've got no idea what you'll be doing tomorrow, nothing's planned ahead. There's such a variety of ways of spending the day. There's a sort of 'wake-up at 8 o'clock with the phone ringing' day, and next minute you're off abroad somewhere, which is everybody's idea of modelling. Then, other days you have to go round and sell yourself because you've got nothing on at all — seeing photographers, magazines, newspapers, generally getting your face around. On a busy day you've got to dash from job to job, it's all very hectic, but basically you've always got to have everything literally by the phone, be ready to leave at a moment's notice. But there's variety in it. Making TV commercials has in fact now overtaken straightforward fashion as our favourite occupation. It's more fun than photographic work, where one split second decides whether you look nice or not. In a TV commercial there's some acting involved, and you have to keep it up for a while, which is more of a challenge.


Jeffrey: When Margaret said she kept everything by the phone, I wondered what she meant.


Margaret: Definitely your diary, with a pen, waiting for that interview. Then every model has one arm longer than the other (laughs) because of all the things she has to cart around in her bag — spare pairs of shoes, make-up, spare tights, and a book — it can get boring waiting around sometimes. I read such a lot of novels! Umm, everything but the kitchen sink — it all has to be packed in.


Jeffrey: Whatever her motivation, it's quite clear that Margaret enormously enjoys being a model.


Margaret: Yes, I love it! It's fantastic! I just couldn't think of doing anything else. It's always been the glamour that attracted me. To begin with, it's real hard work to get established, but the variety and excitement of not knowing from one day to the next what's going to happen has never ceased to give me a thrill.

我们都在电视广告中见过他们，从光鲜亮丽的杂志封面上看着我们，或者炫耀来自巴黎的最新创作，在我们看来，他们的生活一定充满魅力。杰弗里·英格拉姆斯一直在深入研究时装模特的世界，并得出了一些有趣的事实。

丹尼斯：普通模特的收入与高级秘书大致相同，也就是说，她是一名自由职业者，有经纪人派她出去试镜和面试，并为她找到工作。

杰弗里：丹尼斯·哈珀是一名模特经纪人。她是中央模特经纪公司的合伙人，该机构与大都会模特学院关系密切，多年来，数十名有抱负的模特来到该学院付费参加模特技术的基础课程。就在五年前，十八岁的玛格丽特·康纳 (Margaret Connor) 就是这样一位有抱负的模特，她刚从学校毕业。

玛格丽特：你妈妈告诉过你，你是一个漂亮的女孩，你认为你是上帝的礼物。当然，你不是，但学院给你作品，如何化妆，如何走路，如何做头发，着装品味，等等。

杰弗里：现在，在我们进一步讨论之前，我真的应该让你了解一下玛格丽特的长相。她身高约 5 英尺 8 英寸，留着及肩的赤褐色头发、淡褐色的眼睛和笑容。像玛格丽特一样，每个模特都有她的索引卡，潜在客户可以将其保存在他们的文件中以供参考。不工作时，玛格丽特是一个比一般人漂亮的邻家女孩，但仅凭她的照片似乎就表明她可以像任何人想要的那样多才多艺和时尚。但为什么丹尼斯·哈珀从其他类似的申请者中挑选了她来参加学院的模特课程呢？

丹尼斯：我总是寻找个性、沉着、良好的身高，以及非常重要的主动性，所有这些都是玛格丽特所具备的。最重要的是，你试图找到一个你认为可以工作的女孩，而不仅仅是为了钱。

杰弗里：当然，当他们完成课程时，并不总是意味着他们就注定会成为明星。玛格丽特偶尔会在学院上课，她告诉我为什么有些女孩只是打包这份工作。

玛格丽特：有时工作太辛苦，有时工作太稀缺，有时你不得不给自己太大压力。你必须成为一名女售货员才能成为一名模特，只是坐下来认为自己会受到宠爱是不行的，你必须出去工作。但一旦你得到了它，好吧，好吧。

杰弗里：当工作真的出现时，它可以是任何东西。

玛格丽特：真的，每次都是不同的工作——可能是电视广告、现场广告促销、拍照，等等。

杰弗里：我请玛格丽特给我一些关于她生活中典型的一天的想法。

玛格丽特：这确实是一件有趣的事情。你不知道明天要做什么，没有任何计划。度过这一天的方式有很多种。有一种“八点钟被电话铃声叫醒”的日子，下一分钟你就要去国外某个地方了，这就是每个人对模特的想法。然后，其他时候你必须到处推销自己，因为你什么也没穿——看摄影师、杂志、报纸，通常是到处露面。在忙碌的一天里，你必须从一个工作赶到另一个工作，这一切都非常忙碌，但基本上你总是必须通过电话掌握一切，准备好随时离开。但其中有多样性。事实上，制作电视广告现在已经取代简单的时尚成为我们最喜​​欢的职业。这比摄影工作有趣多了，一瞬间就决定了你好看不好看。电视广告里有一些表演，你得坚持一段时间，这是一个更大的挑战。

杰弗里：当玛格丽特说她把一切都放在电话里时，我想知道她的意思。

玛格丽特：当然是你的日记，带着笔，等待采访。然后，每个模特的一只手臂都比另一只长（笑），因为她的包里必须装满所有东西——备用鞋子、化妆品、备用紧身衣和一本书——有时等待会很无聊。我读了这么多小说！嗯，除了厨房水槽之外的所有东西——都必须装进去。

杰弗里：无论玛格丽特的动机是什么，很明显她非常喜欢当模特。

玛格丽特：是的，我喜欢它！这是梦幻般的！我只是想不出做其他事情。它的魅力一直吸引着我。首先，建立起来确实很辛苦，但是从一天到下一天不知道会发生什么的变化和兴奋从未停止给我带来兴奋。

== Solving Problems



Today I am going to talk about some thoughts that psychologists have had on how people go about solving problems.





The first point I want to make is that there is no one way of solving all problems. If you think about it you will realize the obvious fact that there are many different kinds of problems which have to be solved in different ways. Let us take two very different examples. A student is sitting in his study, trying to solve a problem in Mathematics. After an hour, still unsuccessful, he gives up and goes to bed. The following morning he wakes up and wanders into the study. Suddenly, the solution comes to him.





Now for a very different kind of problem. In the Shakespeare play Hamlet, young Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, discovers that his father has been murdered by his uncle. The evidence is based on the appearance of his father's ghost, urging him to revenge his death by killing his uncle. Should he accept the ghost's evidence, and kill his uncle? This is obviously a very different kind of problem. Such moral or emotional problems might have no real solution, or at any rate no solution that everyone might agree on.





There are many other different types of problems apart from these two. In this talk, I would like to talk about the first kind of problem: the kind that the student of Mathematics was involved with.





The solution to that kind of problem is sometimes called an 'A-ha' solution, because the solution comes suddenly, out of nowhere as it were, and in English people sometimes say 'A-ha' when a good idea comes to them like that. Another, less amusing, name for it is insight. For a long time the student seems to get no where, and then there is a sudden flash of insight and the solution appears.





A classic example of insight is the case of the French mathematician, Poincare. I'll spell it. P-O-I-N-C-A-R-E, POINCARE. For fifteen days Poincare struggled with a mathematical problem and had no success. Then one evening he took black coffee before going to bed (which was not his usual custom). As he lay in bed, he couldn't sleep, and all sorts of ideas came to him. By morning he had solved that problem which had baffled him for over a fortnight.





What do psychologists have to say about this process of problem solving?





A very good and helpful description of the solving process has been made by POLYA, a teacher of Mathematics. I'll spell his name, too. P-O-L-Y-A, POLYA. Remember that Polya is thinking of insight problems, and in particular, mathematics problems, but his ideas should apply in all sorts of areas.





Polya's description has four stages. They are:  Stage one: Understanding the problem: At this stage, the student gathers all the information he needs and asks himself two questions:  The first question is:





What is the unknown? What is my goal? In other words, what do I want to find out?  The second question is:





What are the data and conditions? What is given? In other words: what do I already know?  Stage two: Devising a plan: here the student makes use of his past experience to decide on the method of solution. At this stage he asks himself three questions:  a) Do I know a problem similar to this one?  b) Can I restate the goal in a different way that will make it easier for me to use my past experience? Polya calls restating the goal 'working backwards'.  c) Can I restate what is given in a way that relates to my past experience? Polya calls restating what is given as 'working forward'. The student stays at stage two until he has the flash of insight. If necessary he can put the problem to one side for a while and then come back to it. Eventually he will see how the problem can be done.  Stage three: Carrying out the plan: the student carries out the plan of solution, checking each step.  Stage four: Looking back: the student checks his answer in some way, perhaps by using another method, or whatever. Having done that, he makes it part of his experience by asking himself: 'Can I use this result or method for other problems'?





I will repeat again that not all problems are like the mathematics problems that Polya is thinking about. Not every problem is solvable, and some may even have no satisfactory solution. Nevertheless, it is probably a good idea to do what Polya has done. That is, when you are successful in solving a problem, analyse how you have done it, and remember your method for the next time.


解决问题

今天我要谈谈心理学家对人们如何解决问题的一些想法。


我想说的第一点是，没有一种方法可以解决所有问题。如果您思考一下，您就会意识到一个明显的事实：存在许多不同类型的问题，必须以不同的方式解决。让我们举两个截然不同的例子。一名学生坐在书房里，试图解决数学问题。一个小时后，仍然没有成功，他放弃了，上床睡觉了。第二天早上，他醒来，走进书房。突然，他想到了解决办法。


现在讨论一个非常不同类型的问题。在莎士比亚戏剧《哈姆雷特》中，年轻的丹麦王子哈姆雷特发现他的父亲被叔叔谋杀了。证据是他父亲的鬼魂出现，敦促他杀死叔叔来报仇。他应该接受鬼魂的证据并杀死他的叔叔吗？这显然是一个非常不同的问题。此类道德或情感问题可能没有真正的解决方案，或者至少没有每个人都同意的解决方案。


除了这两个问题之外，还有许多其他不同类型的问题。在这次演讲中，我想谈谈第一类问题：数学学生所涉及的问题。


这类问题的解决方案有时被称为“A-ha”解决方案，因为解决方案突然出现，不知从何而来，在英语中，当一个好主意出现时，人们有时会说“A-ha”，例如那。另一个不那么有趣的名字是洞察力。很长一段时间，学生似乎一无所获，然后突然顿悟，解决方案出现了。


洞察力的一个典型例子是法国数学家庞加莱的例子。我会拼写它。 P-O-I-N-C-A-R-E，庞卡莱。庞加莱花了十五天的时间来解决一个数学问题，但没有成功。然后有一天晚上，他在睡觉前喝了一杯黑咖啡（这不是他平常的习惯）。他躺在床上睡不着，各种想法涌上心头。到早上，他解决了困扰他两个多星期的问题。


对于这个解决问题的过程，心理学家有什么看法？


数学老师 POLYA 对求解过程做了非常好的、有用的描述。我也会拼写他的名字。 P-O-L-Y-A，波利亚。请记住，波利亚正在考虑洞察力问题，特别是数学问题，但他的想法应该适用于各种领域。


波利亚的描述分为四个阶段。它们是： 第一阶段：理解问题：在这个阶段，学生收集他需要的所有信息并问自己两个问题：第一个问题是：


什么是未知的？我的目标是什么？换句话说，我想知道什么？第二个问题是：


有哪些数据和条件？给予什么？换句话说：我已经知道什么？第二阶段：制定计划：在这里，学生利用他过去的经验来决定解决方案的方法。在这一阶段，他问自己三个问题： a) 我是否知道与此类似的问题？ b) 我可以用不同的方式重申目标，以便更容易利用我过去的经验吗？波利亚称重申这一目标是“逆向工作”。 c) 我可以用与我过去的经验相关的方式重述所给出的内容吗？波利亚称重申“继续努力”。学生停留在第二阶段，直到他获得顿悟。如果有必要，他可以把问题暂时放在一边，然后再回来解决。最终他会看到如何解决这个问题。第三阶段：执行计划：学生执行解决方案的计划，检查每一步。第四阶段：回顾：学生以某种方式检查他的答案，也许使用另一种方法，或其他什么。完成此操作后，他问自己：“我可以使用这个结果或方法来解决其他问题”，从而将其作为自己的经验的一部分吗？


我再说一遍，并不是所有的问题都像波利亚正在思考的数学问题。并不是所有的问题都能得到解决，有的甚至可能没有令人满意的解决方案。尽管如此，像波利亚所做的那样可能是个好主意。也就是说，当你成功解决了一个问题后，分析一下你是如何做到的，并记住你的方法，以供下次使用。
