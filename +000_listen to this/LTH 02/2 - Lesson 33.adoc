Lesson 33 +


== part


Angela: Would you like ... to tell me about it? +

Denise: Yes, I think ... it's rather a unique experience, actually. I was in New York, er, er, a few years ago and I wanted to read a particular poem, so I went along to the public library. (I see) Now, the public library is different from any, er, library that I'd ever seen, because you never see a book on a shelf, and, er, I went into the building and I was directed to Room 101, where I had to fill in a form with the author and the title of the book that I wanted. I was handed a disc and directed to another room which looked like a cinema. I sat down in this room and waited for the number on my disc to flash on the screen. I waited and waited and waited and noticed that people who came in after me, er, were leaving (Mhm) and so I went back to the original room to find out what had happened and I was told that, erm, they couldn't read the writing on my form, (oh dear) so I filled in another form and was on my way to, er, th, the cinema-like room when, erm, I saw, er, a woman standing in the ... in the corridor. Now she was obviously trying to attract somebody's attention. She was dressed very poorly and she had what looked like, er, a sor..., some kind of fur hat, a rather mangy fur hat, and on this hat was fixed a ra, a crook-like feather, a very, very long crook-like feather. And, er, this, this attracted, er, my attention I think more than anything, so I stopped and asked her if I could help her and she told me what I thought then was a rather a, an appalling story. She'd come in from the outskirts of New York, erm, to see a sick friend, and just as, as she had been coming out of the underground train, the doors had closed and her handbag had been snatched and her umbrella, er, was caught in the closing door. She managed to wrench the umbrella out and a little bit was chipped off. She showed me where it had been chipped off. (M) She said that she had no money to return home and also she'd had nothing to eat all day. So I forgot about the poetry and we went over the road to a little tea-shop. And I must say it was when we got to the tea-shop and I was getting the tea and had left my bag on the chair that I began just to be a tiny little bit suspicious and I looked back at her but she was sitting quite innocently at the table. (M) Anyway, we had a little conversation — she was quite an interesting woman — and then I sa..., I realized that it was about time I was making my way home. So I said to her, 'Well, erm, I've got two dollars and ten dollars. Er, how much will you need?' And she said, 'Well, the ten dollars will do me fine'. I thought that was little bit much at the time so I said, 'No, I'll give you the two dollars', which I did. And then we, we, we bade each other good-bye and I was just ... going off when she called me back and said, 'May I, er, take your address, so that I can return the two dollars?' which, er, I gave her and then I went off. I had sundry other things to do. I think I went to a book-shop, and I went to buy a scarf or pair of gloves and, er, er, all these things on my way home and when I got home I was still thinking about the two dollars and I opened my purse to, to count my money and I found that I had about fourteen or fifteen dollars when I'd, when I had only had the twelve when I set off originally. (Mm) (Nasty) So somebody along the way had given me the wrong change. I did think about retracing my steps, but it seemed too much trouble, so I didn't. I waited about a week, half expecting my two dollars back but, of course, it didn't come back, so I realized that, er, I'd been conned, I think the word is. (Yes) Well, a month later, I was walking around — it was the end of January — I was walking around, er, in New York and it really was freezing. I couldn't feel my hands or my feet. So I went into the Barbazon Plaza Hotel to warm myself, because all the buildings in New York are centrally heated, and as soon as I'd got into the hotel, I noticed that the foyer was covered with mirrors and, in one corner of the foyer, I saw this old woman. Now the reason why I recognized her was that she was dressed in a Persian lamb coat this time — very, very expensive Persian lamb coat — and she had a Persian lamb hat on her head. But affixed to this Persian lamb hat was the same long crook-like feather! +

Angela: How funny! +

Denise: So I thought to myself, 'Well, it's amazing. I, I, I wonder if I will get the same story if I go over there.' So I went over to the mirror and took out my comb and compact and pretended to set about, er, righting my face, when the lady came up to me and without any ado at all poured out the same story. So I turned to her and looked her straight in the face and I said, 'You and I met a month ago in the public library'. And then I walked off.

安吉拉：你愿意……告诉我这件事吗？

丹尼斯：是的，我认为……实际上，这是一次相当独特的体验。几年前我在纽约，呃，呃，我想读一首特别的诗，所以我就去了公共图书馆。 （我明白了）现在，公共图书馆与我见过的任何，呃，图书馆都不一样，因为你永远不会在书架上看到一本书，而且，呃，我走进大楼，我被引导到 101 室，我必须填写一张表格，其中包含我想要的书的作者和书名。他们递给我一张光盘并引导我到另一个看起来像电影院的房间。我坐在这个房间里，等待光盘上的数字在屏幕上闪烁。我等啊等啊等，发现在我之后进来的人，呃，要离开（嗯），所以我回到原来的房间，想知道发生了什么事，我被告知，呃，他们不能阅读我表格上的文字，（哦天哪）所以我填写了另一张表格，然后在去，呃，那个像电影院一样的房间的路上，当，呃，我看到，呃，一个女人站在……​走廊。现在她显然是想引起别人的注意。她穿得很破烂，戴着看起来像，呃，一个sor…​，某种毛皮帽子，一顶很脏的毛皮帽子，在这顶帽子上固定着一根ra，一根弯曲的羽毛，一根非常非常的东西。长弯曲状的羽毛。而且，呃，这个，这吸引了，呃，我的注意力，我想这比什么都重要，所以我停下来问她是否可以帮助她，她告诉我我当时认为这是一个相当可怕的故事。她从纽约郊区进来，呃，去看望一位生病的朋友，正当她走出地铁时，车门关上了，她的手提包被抢走了，她的雨伞，呃，被夹在正在关上的门里。 她设法把雨伞拔了出来，雨伞被削掉了一点。她给我看了它被削掉的地方。 (M) 她说她没钱回家，而且一整天都没吃东西。于是我忘记了那首诗，我们穿过马路去了一家小茶馆。我必须说，当我们到达茶馆时，我正在喝茶，并将包放在椅子上，我开始有点怀疑，我回头看了她一眼，但她坐得很好无辜地坐在餐桌上。 (M) 不管怎样，我们聊了一会儿——她是一个非常有趣的女人——然后我……​，我意识到是时候回家了。所以我对她说，‘好吧，呃，我有两美元和十美元。呃，你需要多少钱？她说：“好吧，十美元就够了”。我当时觉得这有点多了，所以我说，“不，我给你两美元”，我就这么做了。然后我们，我们，我们互相告别，我正要走，她给我回电话说，“我可以，呃，记下你的地址，这样我就可以退还两美元了？”呃，我把它给了她，然后我就走了。我还有很多其他事情要做。我想我去了一家书店，我去买了一条围巾或一双手套，呃，呃，所有这些东西在我回家的路上，当我回到家时，我还在想那两美元，我打开了我掏出钱包，数了数钱，发现当时我身上有十四、十五块钱，而原来出发时我只有十二块钱。 （嗯）（讨厌）所以一路上有人给了我错误的零钱。我确实想过原路返回，但似乎太麻烦，所以我没有。 我等了大约一个星期，一半期待着我的两美元回来，但当然，它没有回来，所以我意识到，呃，我被骗了，我想这个词是。 （是的）嗯，一个月后，我到处走走——那是一月底——我在纽约走走，呃，天气真的很冷。我感觉不到我的手或脚。于是我就走进巴巴松广场酒店取暖，因为纽约的所有建筑都是集中供暖，一进酒店，我就发现门厅里布满了镜子，在一个角落里，到了门厅，我看到了这个老妇人。现在我之所以认出她，是因为她这次穿着一件波斯羊羔毛大衣——非常非常昂贵的波斯羊羔毛大衣——头上还戴着一顶波斯羊羔毛帽子。但这顶波斯羊羔帽上却贴着同样长长的弯状羽毛！
  安吉拉：真有趣！

丹尼斯：所以我心里想，‘嗯，这太棒了。我，我，我想知道如果我去那里我是否会得到同样的故事。于是我走到镜子前，拿出梳子和粉盒，假装要开始，呃，矫正我的脸，这时那位女士走到我面前，毫不犹豫地讲述了同样的故事。于是我转向她，直视她的脸，说道：“你和我一个月前在公共图书馆见过面”。然后我就走开了。

In this country, today was a day of waiting by voters to learn if their candidate won or lost. That provides more suspense than is typical in elections in Mexico. In that country, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party has not lost a single state or national election since its founding in 1929. Critics of the system in Mexico say it is not truly democratic because the opposition parties had virtually no chance of taking power. But those parties have grown stronger in recent years and there is increasing pressure to change the procedures for elections. Today the Mexican Congress began work on a package of reforms that eventually could give opposition parties a greater voice in politics in Mexico. NPR's Tom Julton reports in Mexico City. +

 +

A week ago Sunday, voters in the Mexican state of Sinaloa elected a new governor. But in a few days, spokesmen for the National Action Party, the opposition, were claiming victory. But yesterday the government announced a different result. The winner, the government said, was the candidate of the ruling party, the PRI, by its initials in Spanish, and by a three-to-one margin. The National Action Party immediately charged that the PRI with the government's help has stolen the election. The accusation has become routine. Opposition parties in Mexico from the left to the right claimed the government here manipulates elections to guarantee that the PRI always wins. Government funds, the opposition says, pay for PRI campaigns, and government employees are forced to support PRI candidates as the price of keeping their jobs. When that is not enough to ensure a PRI victory, opposition leaders say, the government will stuff the ballot boxes, falsify voter registrations or even change the final tally. +

 +

Government officials say the charges are unfair, but they admit to having a credibility problem both at home and abroad. So Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid announced last summer that he would propose sweeping changes in election system. This morning his suggestions were presented to the Mexican Congress. Some of the proposals satisfy long standing demands of the opposition. The most important may be the introduction of the translucent ballot boxes so that official poll watchers can verify that no one has stuffed the boxes beforehand. A new federal elections commission will be established with the power to judge the fairness of the elections and a permanent list of voters would be prepared with the assistance of all political parties. +

 +

The reforms would also give opposition parties more representation in the national Congress. Two hundred out of five hundred congressional seats will be awarded to opposition parties in proportion to the number of votes they receive. It's the most ambitious political reform in recent Mexican history but opposition leaders here are still not satisfied. Sisirial Romaro, a Congress woman from the National Action Party, says no real reform is possible in Mexico until the bond between the government and its official party the PRI is broken. +

 +

Opposition leaders today responded to the President's reform package by offering one of their own. They propose that all the seats in the national Congress be distributed in proportion to party votes. And they want the elections to be overseen by a separate tribunal completely independent of the government. But the opposition's proposals have no chance of being approved since the PRI totally controls the national Congress and enacts virtually everything the government proposes. In Mexico City, I'm Tom Julton.

在这个国家，今天是选民等待了解他们的候选人是否获胜或失败的一天。这比墨西哥选举中的典型选举更具悬念。在该国，执政的革命制度党自 1929 年成立以来从未输过一次州或全国选举。墨西哥这一制度的批评者表示，它不是真正的民主，因为反对党几乎没有夺取权力的机会。但这些政党近年来变得越来越强大，改变选举程序的压力也越来越大。今天，墨西哥国会开始制定一系列改革方案，最终可以让反对党在墨西哥政治中拥有更大的发言权。 NPR 的汤姆·朱尔顿在墨西哥城报道。


一周前的周日，墨西哥锡那罗亚州的选民选举了一位新州长。但几天后，反对党国家行动党的发言人宣布获胜。但昨天政府宣布了不同的结果。政府表示，获胜者是执政党革命制度党（PRI（其西班牙语缩写））的候选人，以三比一的优势获胜。国家行动党立即指责革命制度党在政府的帮助下窃取了选举结果。这种指责已成为常态。墨西哥从左到右的反对党都声称政府操纵选举以保证革命制度党总是获胜。反对派称，政府资金用于支付 PRI 竞选费用，政府雇员被迫支持 PRI 候选人，作为保住工作的代价。反对派领导人表示，如果这还不足以确保革命制度党获胜，政府就会塞满投票箱、伪造选民登记，甚至改变最终计票结果。


政府官员表示这些指控不公平，但他们承认在国内外都存在信誉问题。因此，墨西哥总统米格尔·德拉马德里去年夏天宣布，他将提议对选举制度进行彻底改革。今天早上，他的建议已提交给墨西哥国会。其中一些提案满足了反对派长期以来的要求。最重要的可能是引入半透明投票箱，以便官方投票观察员可以核实没有人事先填充了投票箱。将成立新的联邦选举委员会，有权判断选举的公平性，并在各政党的协助下制定永久选民名单。


这些改革还将赋予反对党在国会中更多的代表权。 500个国会席位中的200个将按照反对党获得的票数比例分配给反对党。这是墨西哥近代史上最雄心勃勃的政治改革，但反对派领导人仍不满意。国家行动党的国会女议员西西里尔·罗马罗表示，在政府与其官方政党革命制度党之间的联系被打破之前，墨西哥不可能进行真正的改革。


今天，反对派领导人提出了自己的改革方案，以回应总统的改革方案。他们提议，全国代表大会的所有席位均按政党得票比例分配。他们希望选举由一个完全独立于政府的独立法庭监督。但反对派的提议没有机会获得批准，因为革命制度党完全控制了国会，并几乎颁布了政府提出的所有提议。在墨西哥城，我是汤姆·朱尔顿。

== What Your Sense of Time Tells about You (II) +


Time line people see time as flowing, too. For them, however, no one situation is important. Rather, life is a carpet, rolling from the past into the present and onward to the future. Any instance is but a footfall on the carpet. +

 +

For the time line people, for whom yesterday, today and tomorrow are an integrated whole, the past is not a past of personal feeling. It is the detached, historical past. Any given event must fit into a larger picture, even if pushed and tugged into place. The desire to put events in historical order enables the time line type to frame hypotheses, to draw conclusions and to make predictions; in short, to be scientific. Naturally, only a few are likely to have true scientific insights but all share the mental process, initial research indicates. +

 +

Before starting any project the time line person examines the whole situation and tries to see it in ideal terms. He wants to make up his mind and arrive at a logical conclusion before he acts. School Principal 2 — a time line type — is probably prepared to deal with a fight before it even occurs, since fights among students are a potential hazard in most schools. +

 +

The desire to envision the whole picture is often seen as a lack of enthusiasm in the time line people. They are often reputed to be cold, detached and uncaring. They are really none of these things. However, they are happiest when they can project their view far forward and far backward in time. +

 +

You say to your time line father, "Let's buy a boat. Joe saw one that's going to be auctioned this afternoon. It looks great." +

 +

An inquisition will follow: "Whose boat was it? Has it ever been in a wreck? Is it fiberglass or wood? How do you know it is seaworthy? Where would you use it? How do you know it won't be bid up to a huge price? Does it have a trailer? Have you shopped enough for boats to know if it is a good one? Where would you store it in the winter?" When the questions are through, you probably wish you had never mentioned the boat in the first place, but you know from past experience that a time line person will always ask lots of questions. +

 +

On the other hand, if you do buy the boat, a time line person is a comfort at the helm. He will have checked all of the safety factors, will know the weather forecast, will have a good liferaft stowed, will have purchased charts of the area, will have seen that extra supplies are available and will know where the best fishing is reported. He will be a competent captain and will know not only his own duties, but the jobs of the crew. +

 +

The third type of person is the present type. He is totally concerned with the immediate and the present, reports the Mann research team. He has the greatest ability to understand the present moment with all of its shadings and ramifications. This total reliance on the present creates most of his strongest traits. For him, life is a happening. Where it is going, where it comes from, is of little interest. He does not integrate past experiences into present activities. +

 +

School Principal 3, the one who knew he could take charge, was a present type person. Dr. Mann and her colleagues theorize that this time type responds without hesitation to the stimulus presented by the object or person before him. No prearranged plan or commitment gets in this type's way, according to Mann's research. +

 +

A present type is superbly equipped to deal with crises and emergencies. He responds to slight cues and acts immediately. He doesn't have to decide between various courses of action. The event itself tells him what to do. +

 +

Your brother, for example, might be a present type. He is happy as a policeman, making quick decisions and acting promptly. Or he is a volunteer Red Cross organizer, quick with answers in a flood disaster area. +

 +

Because he does not feel any future, even a slight delay will annoy a present type. Waiting is the same as denial. He will not wait. He may try to manoeuvre others into his wishes and, if unable to get his own way, is quite likely to dissolve the relationship. +

 +

The fourth type is the person who places faith in the future. He first perceives the future and then works backwards from that vision into, for him, the lesser reality of the present. +

 +

Future types are more concerned with trying to ascertain what is possible rather than what exists now. "For one of this type, the present is a pale shadow, the past a mist, warmth and sunshine, bright lights and excitement are to be found beyond the next bend in the road, on the other side of the mountain. But rounding a bend only leads temporarily to a straight path; there is always another curve," explain the psychologists. All of the life of a future type is spent dashing around the next bend. +

 +

Principal 4 is a future type, happier with his plans for breaking up future fights than the one that has materialized. +

 +

If you are a future type, you might have looked at a course catalogue in college and found you lacked a listed prerequisite for just the course you wanted to take. Chances are you were always a little lost because you didn't have the prescribed background. "Why does it have to be typed letter-perfect?" You've always exclaimed when you handed in a paper. +

 +

You also inspire others with your ideas. If you are active in the local Citizens for Environment, you were the one that dreamed up the biggest fund-raising scheme in years. However, most likely someone else worked out the details because you are terribly impatient with them. +

 +

If the three psychologists are correct, we have a new tool for understanding one another. It will make it easier to get along with those who basically differ from us. Dr. Osmond envisions a time when we could use the theory to aid in selecting the kind of politician best suited for the current problems. "If we are right," he explains, "there is no such thing as a philosopher-king. You either get a philosopher with an interest in ruling or a king who enjoys philosophy, but you will never get a philosopher-king; it doesn't happen."


你的时间观念告诉你什么（II）
时间线人们也认为时间是流动的。然而，对他们来说，没有一种情况是重要的。相反，生活是一张地毯，从过去滚动到现在，再滚动到未来。任何实例都只是地毯上的脚步声。


对于时间线人来说，昨天、今天和明天是一个不可分割的整体，过去不是个人感觉的过去。这是独立的、历史的过去。任何给定的事件都必须适应更大的图景，即使是被推拉到位。将事件按历史顺序排列的愿望使时间线类型能够提出假设、得出结论并做出预测；简而言之，就是要科学。初步研究表明，当然，只有少数人可能拥有真正的科学见解，但所有人都有共同的心理过程。


在开始任何项目之前，时间线人员会检查整个情况并尝试以理想的方式看待它。他想先下定决心，得出一个合乎逻辑的结论，然后再行动。校长 2（时间线类型）可能会在打架发生之前就做好处理的准备，因为学生之间的打架在大多数学校都是潜在的危险。


对时间线的人们来说，想要想象整个画面的愿望常常被视为缺乏热情。他们常常被认为冷漠、冷漠、漠不关心。它们实际上都不是这些东西。然而，当他们能够及时向前和向后投射自己的观点时，他们是最快乐的。


你对你的时间线父亲说：“我们买一艘船吧。乔看到了一艘今天下午要拍卖的船。它看起来很棒。”


随后将进行调查：“这是谁的船？它是否曾遭遇过沉船事故？是玻璃纤维还是木材？你怎么知道它适合航海？你会在哪里使用它？你怎么知道它不会被竞标？ “价格很高吗？它有拖车吗？你买过足够多的船吗？知道它是不是一艘好船？冬天你会把它存放在哪里？”当问题结束时，你可能希望自己一开始就没有提到过那艘船，但从过去的经验中你知道，时间线人总是会问很多问题。


另一方面，如果你买了这艘船，时间安排人员掌舵会让你感到很舒服。他将检查所有的安全因素，了解天气预报，存放好救生筏，购买该地区的图表，查看是否有额外的补给品，并知道报告最佳捕鱼地点的情况。他将成为一名称职的船长，不仅了解自己的职责，而且了解船员的工作。


第三种人是现在的人。曼恩研究小组报告说，他完全关心眼前的事情。他最有能力理解当下的所有阴影和后果。这种对当下的完全依赖造就了他大部分最强大的特质。对他来说，生活就是一场发生。它要去哪里，从哪里来，没人关心。他没有将过去的经验融入现在的活动中。


三号校长是一个知道自己可以负责的人，他是一个爱做事的人。曼恩博士和她的同事推测，这种时间类型会毫不犹豫地对面前的物体或人所呈现的刺激做出反应。根据曼恩的研究，没有预先安排的计划或承诺会妨碍这种类型。


目前的类型具有出色的能力来应对危机和紧急情况。他会对轻微的暗示做出反应并立即采取行动。他不必在各种行动方案之间做出决定。事件本身告诉他该做什么。


例如，你的兄弟可能是现时类型。作为一名警察，他很快乐，能够迅速做出决定并迅速采取行动。或者他是一名红十字志愿者组织者，在洪水灾区快速提供答案。


因为他感觉不到任何未来，即使是轻微的延迟也会让现在的人感到烦恼。等待就等于拒绝。他不会等待。他可能会试图操纵别人按照他的意愿行事，如果不能如愿以偿，很可能会解除这段关系。


第四种是对未来充满信心的人。他首先感知未来，然后从这个愿景回溯到对他来说较小的现实。


未来的类型更关心尝试确定什么是可能的，而不是现在存在的。 “对于这种类型的人来说，现在是苍白的阴影，过去是薄雾，温暖和阳光，明亮的灯光和兴奋可以在路的下一个拐弯处、山的另一边找到。弯曲只能暂时通向一条直线；总会有另一条曲线，”心理学家解释道。未来类型的一生都花在了冲过下一个弯道上。


四号校长是未来型的人，他对自己打破未来打架的计划比已经实现的计划更满意。


如果您是未来类型，您可能查看过大学的课程目录，发现您缺少列出的您想参加的课程的先决条件。很可能你总是有点迷失，因为你没有规定的背景。 “为什么一定要按字母顺序打字呢？”当你交论文时，你总是惊叹不已。


您还用您的想法激励他人。如果您是当地公民环保组织的活跃分子，那么您就是多年来梦想中最大的筹款计划的人。然而，很可能其他人已经解决了细节，因为你对他们非常不耐烦。


如果这三位心理学家是正确的，我们就有了一种相互理解的新工具。与我们本质上不同的人相处会更容易。奥斯蒙德博士设想，有一天我们可以利用该理论来帮助选择最适合当前问题的政治家。 “如果我们是对的，”他解释道，“就不存在哲学家国王这样的东西。你要么得到一个对统治感兴趣的哲学家，要么得到一个享受哲学的国王，但你永远不会得到一个哲学家国王；它不会发生。”
