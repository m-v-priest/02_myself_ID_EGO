Secretary: Well, Monday morning is extremely busy. You've got all the short list interviews.


Principal: Oh goodness. And how long do they go on for?


Secretary: Well, the last one is due at ... to come at 10 o'clock and will probably go on through until 10:30.


Principal: And then?


Secretary: Then you've got your Japanese agent and you did tell him you'd probably take him out to lunch.


Principal: Yes, well can't pass that up ... erm ... what's Tuesday morning look like?


Secretary: Tuesday morning is also very full. You've got a committee meeting, starts at 9:30 probably won't finish until 12:30.


Principal: Huh-Huh. And lunch?


Secretary: Lunch is with your publisher.


Principal: Oh yes. And I do remember that I've got something in the afternoon ... erm ... from the examining board, haven't I? I've got...


Secretary: Yes. At 2:30. You're expecting the chief examiner (Oh) regarding the review report.


Principal: Oh yes. And I've got ... I've got somebody's parents coming.


Secretary: Yes, at 4 o'clock Johan Blun's parents are coming.


Principal: And there ... isn't there a meeting, a principal's meeting after ... anyway he didn't want to be that late ... erm ... well, let's have a look at Monday afternoon. What have we got then?


Secretary: Well the lunch with the Japanese agent is probably likely to last until 2:30. (Mm-Mm) At 2:30 you've got the lawyer regarding the planning permission.


Principal: Oh, I've ... yes ... and?


Secretary: Well at 3:30 there's a tutorial with Maria Rosa ...


Principal: Oh well hang on ... erm ... look what we can do ... you ... if you could give the lawyer a ring and ask him if he can fix it, the appointment, for Wednesday and if he can't make Wednesday, later in the week. It's not absolutely vital that I should do it then. And give Maria Rosa a ring also if you can contact her, otherwise you can tell her when she arrives and ... erm ... I can give I can definitely give her ... I've got Wednesday clear, haven't I? So ... erm ... (Yes) I can give her a tutorial on Wednesday morning (Yes) and that gives us two hours so you could ring the Cultural Council and fix it for then. His name's Mr. Dennis I think, isn't it?


Secretary: Yes. So I'll ring him and tell him you're expecting him at 2:30 on Monday afternoon.


Principal: OK then.


Secretary: Fine. Thank you.




校长：嗯，在我看来，我们似乎必须把他安置在某个地方。周一早上是什么样子的？


秘书：嗯，周一早上非常忙碌。您已经获得了所有的面试候选名单。


校长：哦天啊。他们会持续多久？


秘书：嗯，最后一趟预计于……10 点钟到达，可能会持续到 10:30。


  校长：然后呢？


秘书：那么你有你的日本代理人，你确实告诉他你可能会带他出去吃午饭。


校长：是的，我们不能忽略这一点……呃……周二早上是什么样子？


秘书：周二上午也很充实。你有一个委员会会议，从 9:30 开始，可能要到 12:30 才会结束。


校长：呵呵。午餐呢？


秘书：与你们的出版商共进午餐。

校长：哦，等一下……呃……看看我们能做什么……你……如果你能给律师打电话，问他是否可以解决周三的预约问题，以及他是否无法完成周三，本周晚些时候。那么我是否应该这样做并不是绝对重要的。如果你能联系到玛丽亚·罗莎，也给她打个电话，否则你可以在她到达时告诉她……呃……我可以给我，我绝对可以给她……我星期三已经清楚了，不是吗？所以……嗯……（是的）我可以在周三早上给她一个教程（是的），这给了我们两个小时的时间，这样你就可以给文化委员会打电话并解决这个问题。我想他的名字是丹尼斯先生，不是吗？


秘书：是的。所以我会打电话给他，告诉他你会在周一下午 2:30 等他。


  校长：那好吧。


秘书：好的。谢谢。

At 7:20 pm on May 6th 1937, the world's largest airship, the Hindenburg, floated majestically over Lakehurst airport, New Jersey, after an uneventful crossing from Frankfurt, Germany. There were 97 people on board for the first Atlantic crossing of the season. There were a number of journalists waiting to greet it. Suddenly radio listeners heard the commentator screaming 'Oh, my God! It's broken into flames. It's flashing ... flashing. It's flashing terribly.' 32 seconds later the airship had disintegrated and 35 people were dead. The Age of the Airship was over.





The Hindenburg was the last in a series of airships which had been developed over 40 years in both Europe and the United States. They were designed to carry passengers and cargo over long distances. The Hindenburg could carry 50 passengers accommodated in 25 luxury cabins with all the amenities of a first class hotel. All the cabins had hot and cold water and electric heating. There was a dining-room, a bar and a lounge with a dance floor and a baby grand piano. The Hindenburg had been built to compete with the great luxury transatlantic liners. It was 245 metres long with a diameter of 41 metres. It could cruise at a speed of 125 km/h, and was able to cross the Atlantic in less than half the time of a liner. By 1937 it had carried 1,000 passengers safely and had even transported circus animals and cars. Its sister ship, the Graf Zeppelin, had flown one and a half million kilometres and it had carried 13,100 passengers without incident.





The Hindenburg was filled with hydrogen, which is a highly flammable gas, and every safety precaution had been taken to prevent accidents. It had a smoking room which was pressurized in order to prevent gas from ever entering it. The cigarette lighters were chained to the tables and both passengers and crew were searched for matches before entering the ship. Special materials, which were used in the construction of the airship, had been chosen to minimize the possibility of accidental sparks, which might cause an explosion.





Nobody knows the exact cause of the Hindenburg disaster. Sabotage has been suggested, but experts at the time believed that it was caused by leaking gas which was ignited by static electricity. It had been waiting to land for three hours because of heavy thunderstorms. The explosion happened just as the first mooring rope, which was wet, touched the ground. Observers saw the first flames appear near the tail, and they began to spread quickly along the hull. There were a number of flashes as the hydrogen-filled compartments exploded. The airship sank to the ground. The most surprising thing is that 62 people managed to escape. The fatalities were highest among the crew, many of whom were working deep inside the airship. After the Hindenburg disaster, all airships were grounded and, until recently, they have never been seriously considered as a commercial proposition.


1937 年 5 月 6 日晚上 7 点 20 分，世界上最大的飞艇兴登堡号从德国法兰克福平安无事地飞过新泽西州莱克赫斯特机场。船上共有 97 名乘客，这是本赛季首次横渡大西洋。现场还有不少记者在等候迎接。突然，广播听众听到解说员尖叫道：“哦，天哪！”它已经分解成火焰。它在闪烁……​闪烁。它闪烁得可怕。 32秒后，飞艇解体，造成35人死亡。飞艇的时代结束了。


兴登堡号是欧洲和美国 40 多年来开发的一系列飞艇中的最后一款。它们的设计目的是长距离运送乘客和货物。兴登堡号可容纳 50 名乘客，分布在 25 间豪华客舱内，配备一流酒店的所有设施。所有的小屋都有冷热水和电暖气。这里有餐厅、酒吧和带舞池和小型三角钢琴的休息室。兴登堡号的建造目的是为了与伟大的豪华跨大西洋客轮竞争。它长245米，直径41米。它的巡航速度可达 125 公里/小时，穿越大西洋的时间不到客轮的一半。到 1937 年，它已经安全载运了 1,000 名乘客，甚至还运输了马戏团的动物和汽车。它的姊妹船齐柏林伯爵号已经飞行了 150 万公里，载运了 13,100 名乘客，没有发生任何事故。


兴登堡号充满了氢气，这是一种高度易燃气体，我们已采取一切安全预防措施来防止事故发生。它有一个吸烟室，该吸烟室经过加压，以防止气体进入其中。打火机被拴在桌子上，乘客和船员在上船前都被搜查是否有火柴。飞艇的建造采用了特殊材料，以最大限度地减少意外火花的可能性，从而可能导致爆炸。


没有人知道兴登堡灾难的确切原因。有人提出有人蓄意破坏，但当时的专家认为这是由静电点燃气体泄漏造成的。由于雷暴天气，飞机已经等待着陆三个小时。爆炸发生在第一条潮湿的系泊绳接触地面时。观察者看到第一道火焰出现在尾部附近，并开始沿着船体迅速蔓延。当充满氢气的舱室爆炸时，发出多次闪光。飞艇沉入地面。最令人惊讶的是，有62人成功逃脱。船员中的死亡人数最高，其中许多人在飞艇深处工作。兴登堡灾难后，所有飞艇都被停飞，直到最近，它们从未被认真考虑作为商业提案。

David: Hello Peggy. What are you doing going through all those newspapers?


Peggy: Oh hallo David. I'm trying to find a flat and I've got to go through all these advertisements. I just can't find anything good.


David: Are you wanting to share or do you want a flat on your own?


Peggy: Well, you know Sara and Mary? I'd really like to share with them.


David: Well, I know of an empty flat. I don't know if you'd like it though. It's on the number ten bus route in Woodside Road. Number 10 I think it is.


Peggy: Oh, I know Woodside Road and the ten bus is the one that brings me to work. Would be a marvellous place. How many rooms has it got?


David: Well, it's got a kitchen and a bathroom. Um, apart from that I think it's got two bedrooms and a sitting-room.


Peggy: Two bedrooms. Mm. Well, I suppose two of us could share, or one of us could sleep in the sitting-room. How much is the rent?


David: I think they want ￡21 a week for it.


Peggy: Twenty-one. Oh, that's fine, that would be ￡7 each. I don't really want to spend more than ￡7.


David: No, but you see the trouble is it might be a bit noisy. Woodside Road is really quite busy. It's on the bus route after all. With all that traffic going past I don't know if you'd really like it.


Peggy: Oh, that doesn't matter. We'd be out all day. It'd be marvellous to be on the ten bus route, we wouldn't have to walk at all and we'd get to work so quickly. Oh thanks so much David. I must go and tell Sara and Mary.


David: Well, I hope it's what you want.


Peggy: Oh yes, thanks a lot.


David: That's all right.

大卫：你好，佩吉。你翻那些报纸干什么？


佩吉：哦，大卫，你好。我正在寻找一套公寓，我必须浏览所有这些广告。我就是找不到什么好东西。


大卫：你想要合租还是想要自己一套公寓？


佩吉：嗯，你认识莎拉和玛丽吗？我真的很想与他们分享。


大卫：嗯，我知道有一套空公寓。我不知道你是否愿意。它位于伍德赛德路 (Woodside Road) 的十号巴士路线上。 10号我想是的。


佩吉：哦，我知道伍德赛德路，十路公交车是载我去上班的。将是一个奇妙的地方。它有多少个房间？


大卫：嗯，有厨房和浴室。嗯，除此之外我认为它还有两间卧室和一间客厅。


佩吉：两间卧室。毫米。好吧，我想我们两个人可以共用，或者我们一个人可以睡在客厅里。租金是多少？


大卫：我想他们每周要 21 英镑。


佩吉：二十一岁。哦，没关系，每个 7 英镑。我真的不想花超过 7 英镑。


大卫：不，但你看，问题是它可能有点吵。伍德赛德路确实很繁忙。毕竟是在公交车路线上。由于交通繁忙，我不知道您是否真的喜欢它。


佩吉：哦，那没关系。我们会整天出去。如果能在十路公交车路线上那就太棒了，我们根本不需要步行，而且我们很快就能上班。哦，非常感谢大卫。我必须去告诉萨拉和玛丽。


大卫：嗯，我希望这是你想要的。


佩吉：哦，是的，非常感谢。


大卫：没关系。

Rod: Mm, it's not a bad size room, is it?


Liz: Oh, it's great! It's lovely. Oh, and look at that fireplace! Oh, we can have the two chairs right in front of the fireplace there in the middle of the room and toast our feet.


Rod: The first thing we ought to do is just decide where the bed's going.


Liz: Oh, well ... (So) what about right here next to the door (yes) sort of behind the door as you come in?


Rod: Yes, that's a good idea — just as you come in, just in that corner there.


Liz: Yes. Well now, let's think. What else?


Rod: What else is there? Erm ... well there's that huge wardrobe of yours ... (Mm) that's got to go somewhere.


Liz: What about over here — you know — across from the fireplace there, because then, in that little corner where it ... where the wall goes back ... look, over there. (Mm) That'd do, wouldn't it?


Rod: Ok, well we'll put the wardrobe there then. (Yes) OK? So the wardrobe's opposite the fireplace.


Liz: Er ... (OK) what about your desk? (Er) Where are you going to put that?


Rod: Er ... I need lots of light, so I think in that far corner in between the two windows, OK?


Liz: Oh, I see in the corner there, (Yes) yes. (Erm) Yes, that'd be good.


Rod: So the desk goes there.


Liz: So you'd have your chair with your back to the fireplace? (Yes) Yes, that'll be all right.


Rod: Yes. And there's (yes) the chest of drawers.


Liz: Oh, that'd be nice in between the two windows there, right in the middle. (Yes) It really ... come on, I know you're going to like it. (OK) Come on, let's shove it over there. (I mean) I bet ... I er ...


Rod: I knew you'd ask me to move it.


Liz: Come on. Let's go.


Rod: OK. Let's go then. All right.


Liz: Nearly there! That's got it.


Rod: God, what on earth have you got in there?


Liz: Well, there's nothing much in there. I emptied it ... most of it out.


Rod: Oh God, my back hurts!


Liz: There! Wait a minute. Let me stand back and have a look.


Rod: Yes, it's not bad ... sticks out a bit.


Liz: No, it's fine. (OK) What about the TV? Where are we going to put that?


Rod: Er ... it's really got to go in the opposite corner, hasn't it? (Mm) Opposite the desk, that is.


Liz: Oh, you mean in the corner between the windows and the fireplace? (Yes) Yes.


Rod: And then the stereo, er ... the amplifier underneath the television and then the two speakers one on either side of the fireplace.


Liz: Yes, that'd be good. (Erm) Well lovely! So it'll all fit in beautifully! (Yes) What else ... what else have we got?


Rod: It's the er ... there's the bookcase, isn't there? Erm ...


Liz: Oh Lord ... where'll we put that?


Rod: Well, as you come in the door, er ... immediately on the er ... left-hand side ...


Liz: Oh along that wall there you mean?


Rod: Because that's ... there's just about enough space there. There's about two feet, so it shouldn't stick out too much, no.


Liz: Yes, it's not very wide is it? So you come in the door (Yes) and then the bookcase is right there on the left. (Yes) There's a long way from your desk, though.


Rod: Well, exercise'll do me good, won't it? Er ... table lamp. Well, we can just put that er ...


Liz: On the chest of drawers. (Yes) When it's ... (Mm) Yes. That'd be nice.


Rod: And no matter who wants to use it, you know.


Liz: Yes. Oh this is going to be lovely. When are we going to get it all in? Now?


Rod: Er ... no, not now. Let's just go to the kitchen and er ... sort that out and have a cup of tea, eh.


Liz: Oh, haha, good. (Right) Yes, I haven't seen the kitchen. Come on. 


Rod: Come on then. Let's go.


罗德：嗯，房间大小不错，是吗？


莉兹：噢，太棒了！很可爱。哦，看看那个壁炉！哦，我们可以把两把椅子放在房间中间的壁炉前，然后烤我们的脚。


罗德：我们要做的第一件事就是决定床的位置。


莉兹：哦，好吧……（那么）当你进来时，就在门旁边（是的）在门后面怎么样？


罗德：是的，这是个好主意——就在你进来的时候，就在那个角落里。


莉兹：是的。好吧，现在让我们想一想。还有什么？


罗德：还有什么？嗯……嗯，你的那个巨大的衣柜……（嗯）它必须去某个地方。


莉兹：那这里呢——你知道的——壁炉对面，因为那时，在那个小角落里……墙向后延伸的地方……看，那边。 （嗯）这样就可以了，不是吗？


罗德：好吧，那我们就把衣柜放在那里吧。 （好的？所以衣柜在壁炉对面。


莉兹：呃……（好吧）你的桌子呢？ （呃）你要把它放在哪里？


Rod：呃……​我需要大量的光线，所以我想在两扇窗户之间的那个远角，好吗？


莉兹：哦，我在角落里看到，（是的）是的。 （呃）是的，那就太好了。


罗德：所以桌子就在那里。


莉兹：所以你会把椅子背对着壁炉吗？ （是）是啊，这样就可以了。


罗德：是的。还有（是的）抽屉柜。


莉兹：哦，如果就在两个窗户之间，就在中间，那就太好了。 （是的）真的……来吧，我知道你会喜欢它。 （好）来吧，我们把它推到那边去吧。 （我的意思是）我打赌……我呃……​


罗德：我就知道你会要求我把它搬走。


莉兹：来吧。我们走吧。


罗德：好的。那我们走吧。好的。


莉兹：快到了！就这样了。


Rod：上帝啊，你里面到底装了什么？


莉兹：嗯，里面没什么东西。我清空了它……大部分都被清空了。


罗德：天哪，我的背好痛！


莉兹：那儿！等一下。让我退后看看。


罗德：是的，还不错……有点突出。


莉兹：不，没关系。 （好）电视呢？我们要把它放在哪里？


Rod：呃……它真的必须去对面的角落，不是吗？ （嗯）就是桌子对面。


莉兹：哦，你是说窗户和壁炉之间的角落吗？ （是的是的。


罗德：然后是立体声音响，呃……电视下方的放大器，然后是壁炉两侧的两个扬声器。


莉兹：是的，那就太好了。 （呃）好可爱！所以一切都会很完美！ （是的）还有什么……我们还有什么？


罗德：呃……这是书架，不是吗？嗯……​


莉兹：天哪……我们把它放在哪里？


罗德：嗯，当你进门时，呃……​立即在呃……​左侧……​


丽兹：哦，你是说沿着那堵墙吗？


罗德：因为那是……那里有足够的空间。大约有两英尺，所以它不应该伸出太多，不。


莉兹：是的，不是很宽，是吗？所以你进门了（是的），然后书柜就在左边。 （是的）不过，离你的办公桌很远。


罗德：嗯，锻炼对我有好处，不是吗？呃……​台灯。好吧，我们可以把那个呃……​


莉兹：在抽屉柜上。 （是）当……​（嗯）是的。那太好了。


罗德：无论谁想使用它，你都知道。

罗德：呃……不，不是现在。我们去厨房吧，呃……把事情解决一下，然后喝杯茶，呃。


莉兹：哦，哈哈，很好。 （右）是的，我没有看到厨房。快点。


罗德：那就来吧。我们走吧。

1. Another use for Landsats is to find fresh water. In dry areas such as deserts, Landsat photos may show black areas that indicate water or they may show red areas that indicate healthy plants. People who are trying to find water in these dry areas can save time by looking in the places that are black or red on the Landsat pictures.


2. The fifth use is to warn us of natural disasters, such as the damage done by large forest fires, melting ice near the North and South Poles, and lines in the earth where earthquakes might happen.


3. Many experts believe that we must turn to the sun to solve our energy needs. Solar energy is clean and unlimited. It is estimated that the amount of solar energy falling on the continental United States is 700 times our total energy consumption. It's possible to convert, or change, this energy for our use, but the cost is the major problem. The federal government is spending millions of dollars to find ways to convert, or change, sunshine into economical energy. By the year 2000, solar technology could be supplying about 25 percent of the United States' energy needs.


4. The major expense involved in a solar heating system is the purchase cost of all the parts of the system and the cost of their installation. The approximate cost to buy and put a solar heating system into a three-bedroom house at present varies from $7,000 to $12,000. This is a one-time cost that can be financed over many years. This finance charge may be more expensive than heating with oil at the present prices.


陆地卫星的另一个用途是寻找淡水。在沙漠等干旱地区，陆地卫星照片可能会显示表示有水的黑色区域，或者可能会显示表示健康植物的红色区域。试图在这些干旱地区寻找水源的人们可以通过查看陆地卫星图片上黑色或红色的地方来节省时间。


第五个用途是警告我们自然灾害，例如大型森林火灾、北极和南极附近冰层融化以及地球上可能发生地震的线路造成的破坏。


许多专家认为，我们必须依靠太阳来解决我们的能源需求。太阳能是清洁且取之不尽用之不竭的能源。据估计，落在美国大陆上的太阳能量是我们能源消耗总量的700倍。可以转换或改变这种能源供我们使用，但成本是主要问题。联邦政府正在花费数百万美元寻找将阳光转化为经济能源的方法。到 2000 年，太阳能技术可满足美国约 25% 的能源需求。


太阳能供暖系统的主要费用是系统所有部件的购买成本及其安装成本。目前，购买一套太阳能供暖系统并将其安装到三居室房屋中的费用大约为 7,000 美元至 12,000 美元。这是一项一次性成本，可以在多年内提供资金。按照目前的价格，这笔财务费用可能比用石油取暖还要贵。
