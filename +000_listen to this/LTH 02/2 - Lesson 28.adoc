Lesson 28 +

Robert: Now, one of the biggest hurdles to cross in getting a good job is the interview. There's no getting away from it, because in nearly every case when you apply for a job you will be called for one, or sometimes even two, interviews. It's quite natural that you might also be dreading it; in fact, some people dread them so much they never turn up at all. What I want to try to do today is to take some of the sting out of the interview and get you over what I call 'job interview jitters' to show you how you can make a good impression and even use the interview to your own advantage. I mentioned two interviews earlier because some companies do a kind of screening interview first, where they try to find out what you're like and if you're suitable for the job before you go on to the main interview. This screening interview would probably be with someone from the personnel department, and I'd like now to show you on the video a couple of examples of these screening interviews, which I hope will help to illustrate how to go about it and how not to. In the first, Walter Edwards of the personnel department of a biscuit factory in Southampton is interviewing Anita Jones for a job as a secretary. +

Walter: Come in, I'm Walter Edwards and you're Miss ...? +

Anita: Anita Jones, er, but my friends call me Nita. +

Walter: How do you do, Miss Jones. Do please sit down. Now, your application tells me you were born in these parts. Did you grow up here? +

Anita: Er, um, yes. Well, no. I was born here in Southampton, but my dad, that is my father, works in a bank so we, um, moved up north when I was fairly small, which is where I went to school and, um, then we moved back down here, which is why I live round here now, you see. +

Walter: Quite. And I see you've just completed a one-year secretarial course. Is this your first job application? +

Anita: Yes, er, well, no. I mean, I've had several holiday jobs and part-time jobs but this is, or rather would be my first full-time job. I mean this is the first time I've been looking for one. +

Walter: Do you have any special reason for choosing this company? +

Anita: Oh, not really. I mean, er, yes, I was attracted by the money but that's not the only reason, of course. (Laughs.) +

Walter: I see. And could you tell me about your secretarial skills? +

Robert: Without going any further, I think we can all see that Anita is a very nervous applicant: hesitant and indecisive. It's quite clear that she is petrified by the whole idea of the interview, and her faltering and stammering delivery is even irritating for a Mr. Edwards who has, after all, only a few minutes to find out about Anita and to see if she's the right one for the job. Another important point to raise is appearance, which Anita obviously didn't take much care over. Dress is very important and you should never turn up in jeans and an old sweater if you're after a job in an office or a place of work where you will be meeting people, dealing with clients and that sort of thing. Clean, smart clothes are the order of the day, and try to avoid stage fright, like some nervous actor on the opening night of a new play. Job applicants often look upon the interviewer as some kind of ogre who enjoys making interviewees squirm in their seats, a kind of figure to be looked up to and revered. This negative attitude of mind will not help in any way and will only destroy your self-confidence and ensure failure. +

 +

 +

  Anita also mentioned money straight away, which was bad and made her come across as being mercenary. The one question she did volunteer a lot of information about was her upbringing and that was all highly irrelevant. Before we move on, there's something else I wanted to point out and that was the way Anita moved. As she came into the room she sidled nervously up to the desk and wasn't quite sure whether to shake hands, sit down or what to do and kept looking nervously around her. Throughout the interview she fidgeted about and kept twiddling the strap on her handbag, which she clutched tightly to herself. Furthermore, she sat on the edge of her seat with hunched shoulders and a tense look on her face, all of which indicates to the interviewer she is someone who can't handle pressure and responsibility and who appears indecisive and unsure. You have to remember that you've got about ten or fifteen minutes to show what you're made of, and no matter how good you are normally, it's in these vital minutes that you must project the right image. Now we'll take a look at another interview and see what conclusions can be drawn from that one. In this excerpt, Louise Simpson is being interviewed for a job with a book publishing firm by Audrey Maguire of personnel. +

Louise: I'm Louise Simpson. +

Audrey: Sit down, please, Miss Simpson. I'm Audrey Maguire. +

Louise: How do you do? +

Audrey: When you came in, did you happen to notice all the building work going on? +

Louise: Yes, I did. +

Audrey: Well, that's our new office extension and we're moving there within the month, so that's where you'd be working. +

Loiuise: Yes, I did read about it in the prospectus you sent me about the firm. I'm sure you're looking forward to the move. +

Audrey: Indeed, yes. Now I'd like to ask you one or two questions about your previous experience, if that's all right? +

Louise: Go right ahead. +

Audrey: Have you had any jobs before? +

Louise: Yes, I worked as a secretary in a lawyer's office as a summer job, primarily to earn some money to see me through college, but I also gained some useful work experience into the bargain. While I was there I did secretarial work and also took a turn on the reception desk, to help out, and it was very enjoyable meeting people in this way to vary the routine. +

Audrey: Did you like working in the lawyer's office? +

Louise: From the career point of view it was good to get to know how an office works, but I've always wanted to be in publishing really, which is why I applied for this job. +

Audrey: Now, can you tell me ... +

Robert: I think we've seen enough to make the distinction between Louise and Anita you saw in the previous slip. Louise gives a totally different image, an image of self-confidence without being too cocky, and she was conducting herself in a relaxed and friendly way. She talked to the interviewer in a normal manner, which was fluent and without the terrible 'ums' and 'ers' of Anita. She also gave the impression that she was there to exchange information with the interviewer rather than be interrogated. She wanted to know if the company was going to suit her as much as they wanted to know if she would suit them. Her clothes were sober and neat, without being too frumpy, and she was relaxed and casual without being too laid-back so that it would appear she didn't care. She had also taken the trouble to read the prospectus she'd been sent, which didn't hurt at all. The basic point about an interview is that it shouldn't be a question-and-answer routine, a boss and servant session, but a coming together of two personalities. It's the 'swan technique' which projects the best image in my view, serene on the surface but paddling like mad underneath. And now I'd like to come to the problem of ...

罗伯特：现在，获得一份好工作要跨越的最大障碍之一就是面试。这是不可避免的，因为几乎在所有情况下，当您申请工作时，您都会被要求参加一次，有时甚至两次面试。你可能也会害怕它，这是很自然的。事实上，有些人非常害怕他们，以至于根本不出现。今天我想做的就是消除面试中的一些刺痛，让你克服我所说的“求职面试紧张感”，向你展示如何给人留下好印象，甚至利用面试为自己谋利。 。我之前提到过两次面试，因为有些公司会先进行一种筛选面试，他们会在进行主要面试之前了解你的性格以及你是否适合这份工作。这次筛选面试可能会由人事部门的某个人进行，我现在想在视频中向您展示一些筛选面试的示例，我希望这些示例将有助于说明如何进行以及如何不进行。第一个例子中，南安普敦一家饼干厂人事部的沃尔特·爱德华兹正在面试安妮塔·琼斯，以应聘秘书一职。

沃尔特：请进，我是沃尔特·爱德华兹，你是……小姐？

安妮塔：安妮塔·琼斯，呃，但我的朋友们叫我妮塔。

沃尔特：你好，琼斯小姐。请坐下。现在，你的申请告诉我你出生在这些地方。你是在这里长大的吗？

安妮塔：呃，嗯，是的。嗯，不。我出生在南安普敦，但我的父亲，就是我的父亲，在一家银行工作，所以我们，嗯，在我很小的时候就搬到了北方，那是我上学的地方，嗯，然后我们又搬回来了在这里，这就是我现在住在这里的原因，你看。

沃尔特：确实如此。我看到你刚刚完成了为期一年的秘书课程。这是您的第一份工作申请吗？

安妮塔：是的，呃，好吧，不。我的意思是，我做过几份假期工作和兼职工作，但这是，或者更确切地说，将是我的第一份全职工作。我的意思是这是我第一次寻找一个。

Walter：您选择这家公司有什么特殊原因吗？

安妮塔：哦，不完全是。我的意思是，呃，是的，我被金钱所吸引，但这当然不是唯一的原因。 （笑）

沃尔特：我明白了。您能告诉我您的秘书技能吗？

罗伯特：不用多说，我想我们都可以看到安妮塔是一个非常紧张的申请者：犹豫不决、优柔寡断。很明显，她对整个采访的想法感到震惊，而她结结巴巴、结结巴巴的表达甚至让爱德华兹先生感到恼火，毕竟他只有几分钟的时间来了解安妮塔并看看她是否是那个人。适合这项工作的人。另一个需要提出的重要问题是外表，安妮塔显然不太在意这一点。着装非常重要，如果您在办公室或需要与人会面、与客户打交道的工作场所工作结束后，您绝对不应该穿着牛仔裤和旧毛衣出现。干净、漂亮的衣服是日常必需品，并尽量避免怯场，就像新剧首演之夜的一些紧张的演员一样。求职者常常将面试官视为某种怪物，喜欢让面试者在座位上蠕动，是一种值得尊敬和尊敬的人物。这种消极的心态不会有任何帮助，只会摧毁你的自信并注定失败。



安妮塔还直接提到了金钱，这很糟糕，让她给人留下唯利是图的印象。她自愿提供了大量信息的一个问题是她的成长经历，而这一切都非常无关紧要。在我们继续之前，我想指出一件事，那就是安妮塔的移动方式。当她走进房间时，她紧张地侧身走到办公桌前，不确定是该握手、坐下还是该做什么，并一直紧张地环顾四周。在整个采访过程中，她坐立不安，不停地摆弄手提包上的带子，她紧紧地抓着手提包。而且，她坐在座位边上，肩膀驼背，脸上的表情很紧张，这些都让面试官觉得她是一个无法承受压力和责任的人，显得优柔寡断、没有自信。你必须记住，你有大约十到十五分钟的时间来展示你的才华，无论你平时表现得多么出色，在这至关重要的几分钟里，你都必须展现出正确的形象。现在我们来看看另一次采访，看看可以从中得出什么结论。在这段摘录中，路易丝·辛普森正在接受奥黛丽·马奎尔人事部的一家图书出版公司的工作面试。

路易丝：我是路易丝·辛普森。

奥黛丽：请坐，辛普森小姐。我是奥黛丽·马奎尔。

路易丝：你好吗？

奥黛丽：当你进来的时候，你有没有注意到所有的建筑工程正在进行？

路易丝：是的，我做到了。

奥黛丽：嗯，那是我们新的办公室扩建部分，我们将在一个月内搬到那里，所以这就是你工作的地方。

路易斯：是的，我确实在你发给我的关于该公司的招股说明书中读到了这一点。我确信您很期待这一举动。

奥黛丽：确实，是的。现在我想问你一两个关于你之前经历的问题，可以吗？

路易丝： 往前走。

奥黛丽：你以前有过工作吗？

路易丝：是的，我在一家律师事务所担任秘书作为暑期工作，主要是为了赚一些钱供我完成大学学业，但我也通过讨价还价获得了一些有用的工作经验。当我在那里的时候，我做秘书工作，也轮流在接待台帮忙，以这种方式与人们见面来改变日常生活是非常愉快的。

奥黛丽：你喜欢在律师事务所工作吗？

路易丝：从职业角度来看，了解办公室的运作方式很好，但我一直想真正从事出版业，这就是我申请这份工作的原因。

奥黛丽：现在，你能告诉我……​

罗伯特：我想我们已经看到足够多的内容来区分你在上一张幻灯片中看到的路易丝和安妮塔了。路易丝则给人一种完全不同的形象，自信而不张扬，举止轻松又友善。她以正常的方式与采访者交谈，很流利，没有安妮塔那样可怕的“嗯”和“呃”。她还给人留下这样的印象：她是来与采访者交换信息的，而不是接受审问的。她想知道这家公司是否适合她，就像他们想知道她是否适合他们一样。她的衣着素净利落，没有太俗气，轻松随意，又没有太悠闲，让人觉得她并不在意。她还不厌其烦地阅读了寄给她的招股说明书，这并没有什么坏处。面试的基本点是，它不应该是例行问答、老板和仆人的对话，而是两种性格的聚集。这是“天鹅技巧”，在我看来呈现出最好的形象，表面平静，但内心却疯狂地划动。现在我想谈谈……的问题

== part

It is an election day and the Americans of all fifty states are going to the polls. Election observers have predicted a light to moderate turnout, of about forty percent. But some counties' election officials we talked this afternoon were more optimistic. +

 +

"I'm in Lamar, Colorado. It's raining. It's a very grey day. I think we are going to have a real good turnout if the weather doesn't getting worse." +

 +

"I'm the county auditor in the north-eastern portion of Aberdeen, South Dakota, Brown County, South Dakota. Our turnout in Brown County is absolutely fantastic at this point. The weather is cooperating, is absolutely gorgeous, in South Dakota, sun-shining, crisp beautiful day. Couldn't have ordered anything finer?" +

 +

"We are in Shelby, Montana, the county seat of Toole County. The weather is 59 degrees today, no snow anywhere in our area. It's beautiful. No windy. We expected a very good turnout today." +

 +

And it's a small exemplar there. Thirty-six states will elect governors today, in addition there are hundreds of local contests and battle issues to be decided. But the control in the United States senate remains the major item of national interest. A third of the senate, thirty-four seats, will be decided today. Republicans who have held their slim majority in the senate for the past six years are defending twenty-two of those seats. Democrats need a net gain of four seats to win control. According to the latest pre-election polls, the closest senate races were in these nine states, Washington, Idaho, North and South Dakota, North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, California and Colorado. This would be the most closely watched tonight as county election officials turn their attention from watching the skies to counting the ballots.


今天是选举日，全美五十个州的美国人都将前往投票站。选举观察家预测投票率较低至中等，约为百分之四十。但我们今天下午采访的一些县的选举官员更为乐观。


“我在科罗拉多州拉马尔。正在下雨。这是一个非常灰暗的日子。我想，如果天气不变得更糟，我们的投票率将会很高。”


“我是南达科他州阿伯丁东北部、南达科他州布朗县的县审计员。目前布朗县的投票率绝对棒极了。南达科他州的天气很好，绝对是极好的，阳光明媚，清新美好的一天。难道没有更好的选择吗？


“我们在蒙大拿州谢尔比，图尔县的县城。今天的天气是 59 度，我们地区没有任何地方下雪。天气很美。没有风。我们预计今天的投票率会很高。”


这只是一个小例子。今天将有 36 个州选举州长，此外还有数百个地方竞选和战斗问题有待决定。但美国参议院的控制权仍然是国家利益的主要议题。参议院的三分之一，即三十四个席位，将于今天决定。过去六年在参议院占据微弱多数的共和党人正在捍卫其中的二十二个席位。民主党需要净增加四个席位才能赢得控制权。根据最新的选前民意调查，参议员竞选最接近的州是华盛顿州、爱达荷州、南北达科他州、北卡罗来纳州、佐治亚州、阿拉巴马州、加利福尼亚州和科罗拉多州。这将是今晚最受关注的事件，因为县选举官员将注意力从观察天空转向计票。

== Listening and Understanding +


A student learning English often finds the following problems when he listens to talks or lectures. +

 +

Firstly, he doesn't always identify all the words correctly. I refer here to known words. i.e. words which the student would certainly recognize in print. Let's examine some of the reasons for this particular difficulty. In writing, there are clear spaces between each word; in speech, one word runs into the next. It's very difficult to decide, therefore, where one word finishes and the next one begins. +

 +

In writing, the words consist of letters of the alphabet. These letters have a fixed shape: they're easy to identify. In speech, however, vowel and consonant sounds are often very difficult to identify. Some of these sounds may not exist in the student's native language. Many of them, particularly the vowel sounds, are given different pronunciations by different English speakers. +

 +

Finally, some words in English, words like 'and' or 'there' or 'are' or 'will' are frequently pronounced with their weak or reduced form in speech. This is sometimes so short that non-native speakers, perhaps not accustomed to it, fail to recognize it at all. Many students, for example, don't recognize the normal pronunciation / 5TErE / for the words 'there are' which occur at the beginning of so many English sentences. Furthermore, they encounter a similar problem with unstressed syllables which are part of a longer word. For instance, think of the word 'cotton', which is spelt 'c-o-t-t-o-n'. I'll repeat that: 'c-o-t-t-o-n'. Each letter is the same size; no difference is made between the first syllable 'cot-' and the second syllable '-ton'. In speech, however, the first syllable is stressed, the second is unstressed. The work is not pronounced 'cot-ton' but 'COTn'. The same is true for the word 'carbon', spelt 'c-a-r-b-o-n'; it's not pronounced 'car-bon' but 'CAR bn'. +

 +

But I want now to come on to the second main problem; the difficulty of remembering what's been said. Again, the problem here is much less difficult in the written rather than the spoken form. Words on a page are permanently fixed in space. They don't disappear like words that are spoken. They remain in front of you. You can choose your own speed to read them whereas in listening you've got to follow the speed of the speaker. A difficult word, or sentence, on the printed page can be read again, whereas a word not clearly heard is rarely repeated. The listener, therefore, finds that he has to concentrate so hard on identifying the words correctly and on understanding them that he has little time left to remember. +

 +

In a foreign language his brain simply has too much to do. In his own language, of course, he's able not only to identify and understand the words automatically but also he can often even predict the words which are going to come. His brain, therefore, has much more time to remember. +

 +

Thirdly, I want to deal with a problem that worries most students in a lecture. The problem is this — they can't always follow the argument. This is, of course, partly due to the first two difficulties I've discussed. When you have difficulty in identifying or remembering words and sentences, you obviously won't be able to follow the argument. But even those students who can do these two things perfectly well have problems in following a quite straightforward argument. Why is this? I'll suggest three reasons here. Firstly, students don't always recognize the signals which tell the listener that certain points are important. Some of these signals will be quite different from those employed in writing. Secondly, some students try too hard to understand everything. When they come to a small but difficult point, they waste time trying to work it out, and so they may miss a more important point. Thirdly, students must concentrate very hard on taking notes and therefore may miss developments in the argument. But note-taking is a separate subject which will be dealt with in a later talk. +

 +

There are, however, other problems the student is faced with, which I'd like to mention briefly. +

 +

It's always a surprise to students to discover how much the pronunciation of English changes from one English-speaking country to another, and from region to region. Many lecturers from Britain have a B.B.C. type accent, the type of English associated mainly with the South of England and most commonly taught to non-native speakers. However, other lecturers will speak differently. To give an example / bQs /, / lQv /, / mQm / etc., as spoken in the south, are pronounced in Manchester and many other parts as / bRs /, / lRv / and / mRm /, Southern English / ^rB:s /, / fB:st /, / pB:W / are pronounced in Yorkshire and elsewhere as / ^rAs /, / fAst / and / pAW /. It's worth noticing that it's usually the vowels which have variants, though sometimes it may be the consonants. For instance, a Scotsman will roll his 'r's', whereas a Londoner won't. So a lecturer with a particularly strong regional accent will cause non-native speakers considerable difficulty. +

 +

Whether a student follows a lecture easily or not depends also on the style of English the lecturer uses. By 'style' I mean the type of English chosen to express an idea: at one extreme it may be very formal, at the other colloquial or even slang. Generally speaking, the more formal the style, the easier it is for the student to understand. For example, a lecturer who says, formally, 'This is undoubtedly the writer's central point' will be readily understood. On the other hand if he says, 'That's really what the writer's on about, many students will have difficulty in understanding. +

 +

Other factors, which I haven't the time to discuss in detail, may also be involved. These include the speed at which the lecture is delivered, the rather common use of irony, the peculiarly English sense of humour, references which presuppose a knowledge of British culture, etc. +

 +

All these factors combine to make it a formidable task for students to follow lectures comfortably. It's clearly helpful to be aware of the problems and to get as much practice as possible in listening to and trying to understand spoken English.



倾听和理解

学习英语的学生在听讲座或讲座时经常会发现以下问题。


首先，他并不总是能正确识别所有的单词。我这里指的是已知的单词。即学生在印刷体中肯定会认出的单词。让我们来看看造成这种特殊困难的一些原因。写作时，每个词之间有明显的空格；在言语中，一个词会连到下一个词。因此，很难决定一个词在哪里结束，下一个词在哪里开始。


在书面形式中，单词由字母表中的字母组成。这些字母有固定的形状：它们很容易识别。然而，在语音中，元音和辅音通常很难识别。其中一些声音可能不存在于学生的母语中。其中许多，特别是元音，不同的英语使用者有不同的发音。


最后，英语中的一些单词，如“and”或“there”或“are”或“will”等单词在演讲中经常以其弱形式或简化形式发音。有时，这句话太短了，以至于非母语人士可能不习惯，根本无法识别它。例如，许多学生无法识别出现在许多英语句子开头的单词“there are”的正常发音/5TErE/。此外，他们在较长单词的非重读音节上也遇到了类似的问题。例如，想想“棉花”这个词，拼写为“c-o-t-t-o-n”。我会重复一遍：“c-o-t-t-o-n”。每个字母大小相同；第一个音节“cot-”和第二个音节“-ton”之间没有区别。然而，在言语中，第一个音节是重读音节，第二个音节是非重读音节。该作品的发音不是“cott-ton”，而是“COTn”。 “碳”一词也是如此，拼写为“c-a-r-b-o-n”；它的发音不是“car-bon”，而是“CAR bn”。


但我现在想谈谈第二个主要问题；记住说过的话的困难。同样，这里的问题以书面形式比以口头形式要简单得多。页面上的文字永久固定在空间中。它们不会像说出的话一样消失。他们仍然在你面前。你可以选择自己的阅读速度，而在聆听时你必须跟随说话者的速度。打印页上的困难单词或句子可以再次阅读，而听不清楚的单词很少会重复。因此，听者发现他必须集中精力正确识别单词并理解它们，以至于他几乎没有时间去记忆。


在外语中，他的大脑有太多事情要做。当然，在他自己的语言中，他不仅能够自动识别和理解单词，而且常常甚至可以预测即将出现的单词。因此，他的大脑有更多的时间来记忆。


第三，我想解决一个在讲座中大多数学生担心的问题。问题是——他们不能总是遵循论点。当然，这部分是由于我讨论的前两个困难。当你难以识别或记住单词和句子时，你显然无法理解论点。但即使是那些能够完美地完成这两件事的学生，在遵循相当简单的论证时也会遇到问题。为什么是这样？我在这里提出三个原因。首先，学生并不总是能识别出告诉听众某些要点很重要的信号。其中一些信号与书面中使用的信号有很大不同。其次，有些学生太努力去理解一切。当他们遇到一个小而困难的点时，他们会浪费时间去解决它，因此他们可能会错过更重要的点。第三，学生必须非常专心记笔记，因此可能会错过论证的进展。但记笔记是一个单独的主题，将在稍后的演讲中讨论。


然而，学生还面临着其他问题，我想简要提及一下。


学生们总是会惊讶地发现英语发音从一个英语国家到另一个英语国家、从一个地区到另一个地区有多大的变化。许多英国讲师都有 B.B.C.类型口音，主要与英格兰南部相关的英语类型，最常教授给非母语人士。然而，其他讲师的说法会有所不同。举个例子，南方口语中的/bQs/、/lQv/、/mQm/等，在曼彻斯特等很多地方发音为/bRs/、/lRv/和/mRm/，南方英语/^rB :s /、/fB:st/、/pB:W/ 在约克郡和其他地方发音为 /^rAs/、/fAst/ 和 /pAW/。值得注意的是，通常是元音有变体，尽管有时也可能是辅音。例如，苏格兰人会发出“r”，而伦敦人则不会。因此，一个带有特别浓重的地方口音的讲师会给非母语人士带来相当大的困难。


学生能否轻松听懂讲座还取决于讲师使用的英语风格。我所说的“风格”是指用来表达某种想法的英语类型：在一个极端情况下，它可能非常正式，在另一种情况下，它可能是口语甚至俚语。一般来说，风格越正式，学生越容易理解。例如，一位讲师正式地说“这无疑是作者的中心论点”，这很容易理解。另一方面，如果他说：“这就是作者的真正意思，很多学生就会难以理解。”


可能还涉及其他因素，但我没有时间详细讨论。其中包括演讲的速度、反讽的相当普遍的使用、英国特有的幽默感、以了解英国文化为前提的参考资料等。


所有这些因素结合在一起，使学生轻松地听课成为一项艰巨的任务。意识到这些问题并在聆听和尝试理解英语口语方面进行尽可能多的练习显然是有帮助的。
