Lesley: Ah ... it's such a lovely day. It reminds me of last week, doesn't it you? +
Fiona: Oh don't! I mean that was just so fantastic  极好的；了不起的, that holiday! +
Lesley: I love that city, you know. +
Fiona: I do too. Really, it's got something about it, a certain sort of charm 魅力；魔力；吸引力 ... +
Lesley: Mm, and all that wine and good food ... +
Fiona: And so cheap. Right, I mean, *compared to* here ... +
Lesley: Yes, although the shops are expensive. +
Fiona: Mm, yes. +
Lesley: I mean, really I bought nothing at all. I just ate and ate and drank and drank. +
Fiona: I know. Wasn't that lovely? +
Lesley: Yes, and I, I go there. I like listening to the people talking, sitting outside drinking wine. +
Fiona: Yes. Could you understand what they were saying? When they were speaking quickly, I mean. +
Lesley: Well, it is difficult, of course. And then I liked that tower, too. +
Fiona: You liked that tower? I'm not sure about it, really. (No) It's very unusual, right in the centre of the city. +
Lesley: True, but there's a lovely view from the top. +
Fiona: Oh, you went right up, didn't you? (Mm, yes) Oh no, I didn't. +
Lesley: Of course you didn't. +
Fiona: I remember that day. We weren't together. +
Lesley: No, that's right. (Mm) You went down by the river, didn't you? +
Fiona: That's it. Oh, walking along the river and all the couples (Yes) and it's so romantic ... (Is it true) and the paintings too ... +
Lesley: They do have artists down by the river, do they? (Yes) Oh, how lovely! +
Fiona: Oh, it really is super (a.) 顶好的；超级的；顶呱呱的. +
Lesley: Yes. Oh, I think we ought to go back there again next year, don't you? +
Fiona: I do, yes. (Mm) *If only just to* sample (v.)尝；品尝；尝试；体验 some more of the wine. +
Lesley: It'd be lovely, wouldn't it? +
Fiona: Yes.


莱斯利：啊……这是多么美好的一天。这让我想起了上周，不是吗？ +
菲奥娜：哦，不要！我的意思是，那个假期真是太棒了！ +
莱斯利：我喜欢那个城市，你知道。 +
菲奥娜：我也是。真的，它有它的一些东西，某种魅力……​ +
莱斯利：嗯，还有所有的酒和美食……​ +
菲奥娜：而且这么便宜。是的，我的意思是，与这里相比……​ +
莱斯利：是的，虽然商店里的东西很贵。 +
  菲奥娜：嗯，是的。 +
莱斯利：我的意思是，我真的什么都没买。我只是吃啊吃啊喝啊喝。 +
菲奥娜：我知道。那不是很可爱吗？ +
莱斯利：是的，我，我去那里。我喜欢听人们说话，坐在外面喝酒。 +
菲奥娜：是的。你能听懂他们在说什么吗？我是说，当他们说话很快时。 +
莱斯利：嗯，这当然很困难。然后我也喜欢那座塔。 +
菲奥娜：你喜欢那座塔吗？我真的不确定。 （不）这很不寻常，就在市中心。 +
莱斯利：是的，但是从上面看风景很美。 +
菲奥娜：哦，你就上去了，不是吗？ （嗯，是的）哦不，我没有。 +
莱斯利：你当然没有。 +
菲奥娜：我记得那天。我们没有在一起。 +
莱斯利：不，没错。 （嗯）你是从河边下去的吧？ +
菲奥娜：就是这样。哦，沿着河边散步，还有所有的情侣（是的），真是太浪漫了……​（是真的吗）还有画作……​ +
莱斯利：河边确实有艺术家，是吗？ （是）噢，多么可爱啊！ +
菲奥娜：哦，真的太棒了。 +
莱斯利：是的。哦，我想我们明年应该再去那里，不是吗？ +
菲奥娜：我愿意，是的。 （嗯）如果只是为了多尝一些酒就好了。 +
莱斯利：那会很可爱，不是吗？ +
  菲奥娜：是的。 +

First speaker: I'm a night person. I love the hours, you know? I like going to work at around six at night and then getting home at two or three in the morning. I like being out around people, you know, talking to them, listening to their problems. Some of my regulars are always on the lookout for ways that they can stump me. Like last week, one of them came in and asked for a Ramos gin fizz. He didn't think I knew how to make it. Hah! But I know how to make every drink in the book, and then some. Although some of the nights when I go in I just don't feel like dealing with all the noise. When I get in a big crowd it can be pretty noisy. People talking, the sound system blaring, the pinball machine, the video games. And then at the end of the night you don't always smell so good, either. You smell like cigarettes. But I like the place and I plan on sticking around for a while. +

Second speaker: If I had to sit behind a desk all day, I'd go crazy! I'm really glad I have a job where I can keep moving, you know? My favourite part is picking out the music — I use new music for every ten-week session. For my last class I always use the Beatles — it's a great beat to move to, and everybody loves them. I like to sort of educate people about their bodies, and show them, you know, how to do the exercises and movements safely. Like, it just kills me when I see people trying to do situps with straight legs — it' so bad for your back! And ... let's see ... I — I like to see people make progress — at the end of a session you can really see how people have slimmed down and sort of built up some muscle — it's very gratifying. +
 +

The part I don't like is, well, it's hard to keep coming up with new ideas for classes. I mean, you know, there are just so many ways you can move your body, and it's hard to keep coming up with interesting routines and ... and new exercises. And it's hard on my voice — I have to yell all the time so people can hear me above the music, and like after three classes in one day my voice has had it. Then again, having three classes in one day has its compensations — I can eat just about anything I want and not gain any weight! +

Third speaker: What do I like about my job? Money. M-O-N-E-Y. No, I like the creativity, and I like my studio. All my tools are like toys to me — you know, my watercolours, pen and inks, coloured pencils, drafting table — I love playing with them. and I have lots of different kinds of clients — I do magazines, book covers, album covers, newspaper articles — so there's lots of variety, which I like. You know, sometimes when I start working on a project I could be doing it for hours and have no conception of how much time has gone by — what some people call a flow experience.I don't like the pressure, though, and there's plenty of it in this business. You're always working against a tight deadline. And I don't like the business end of it — you know, contacting clients for work, negotiating contracts, which get long and complicated. +

Fourth speaker: Well, I'll tell you. At first it was fun, because there was so much to learn, and working with figures and money was interesting. But after about two years the thrill was gone, and now it's very routine. I keep the books, do the payroll, pay the taxes, pay the insurance, pay the bills. I hate paying the bills, because there's never enough money to pay them! I also don't like the pressure of having to remember when all the bills and taxes are due. And my job requires a lot of reading that I don't particularly enjoy. I can have to keep up to date on all the latest tax forms, and it's pretty dull. I like it when we're making money, though, because I get to see all of my efforts rewarded.


第一个发言者：我是一个夜猫子。我喜欢这几个小时，你知道吗？我喜欢晚上六点左右上班，然后凌晨两三点回家。我喜欢和人们在一起，你知道，与他们交谈，倾听他们的问题。我的一些常客总是在寻找可以难倒我的方法。就像上周一样，其中一个进来要一杯拉莫斯杜松子酒。他认为我不知道怎么做。哈！但我知道如何制作书中的每一种饮料，而且还不止一些。尽管有些晚上，当我进去时，我只是不想处理所有的噪音。当我进入一大群人时，可能会很吵。人们说话，音响系统轰鸣，弹球机，电子游戏。然后到了晚上，你的气味也不总是那么好闻。你闻起来像香烟。但我喜欢这个地方，我打算在这里待一段时间。 +
第二位发言者：如果我必须整天坐在桌子后面，我会发疯的！我真的很高兴我有一份可以继续前进的工作，你知道吗？我最喜欢的部分是挑选音乐——我每十周的课程都会使用新音乐。在我的最后一堂课上，我总是使用披头士乐队——这是一个很棒的节奏，每个人都喜欢他们。我喜欢教育人们有关他们的身体的知识，并向他们展示如何安全地进行练习和运动。就像，当我看到人们试图用直腿做仰卧起坐时，我简直要死了——这对你的背部太糟糕了！而且……让我们看看……我——我喜欢看到人们取得进步——在训练结束时，你可以真正看到人们如何减肥并增加一些肌肉——这是非常令人欣慰的。 +
我不喜欢的是，很难不断地为课程提出新的想法。我的意思是，你知道，移动身体的方法有很多，而且很难不断想出有趣的例程和……以及新的练习。这对我的声音来说很困难——我必须一直大喊大叫，这样人们才能在音乐声中听到我的声音，就像一天上三节课后，我的声音已经受不了了。话又说回来，一天上三节课也有它的好处——我可以吃任何我想吃的东西，而且体重不会增加！ +
第三位发言者：我喜欢我的工作什么？钱。钱。不，我喜欢创造力，我喜欢我的工作室。我所有的工具对我来说就像玩具——你知道，我的水彩画、钢笔和墨水、彩色铅笔、绘图台——我喜欢玩它们。我有很多不同类型的客户——我做杂志、书籍封面、专辑封面、报纸文章——所以有很多种类，这是我喜欢的。你知道，有时当我开始做一个项目时，我可能会花上几个小时，却不知道已经过去了多少时间——有些人称之为心流体验。不过，我不喜欢这种压力，而且这个行业有很多。你总是在紧迫的期限内工作。我不喜欢它的商业目的——你知道，联系客户进行工作，谈判合同，这些都是漫长而复杂的。 +
第四位发言者：好吧，我告诉你。起初很有趣，因为有很多东西要学，而且与数字和金钱打交道也很有趣。但大约两年后，这种兴奋感就消失了，现在已经很平常了。我记账、处理工资、缴税、缴纳保险、支付账单。我讨厌付账单，因为钱永远不够付！我也不喜欢必须记住所有账单和税款何时到期的压力。我的工作需要大量阅读，但我并不特别喜欢。我必须及时了解所有最新的纳税表格，这非常乏味。不过，我喜欢我们赚钱，因为我看到我所有的努力都得到了回报。 +

TV Interviewer: In this week's edition of 'Up with People' we went out into the streets and asked a number of people a question they just didn't expect. We asked them to be self-critical ... to ask themselves exactly what they thought they lacked or — the other side of the coin — what virtues they had. Here is what we heard. +

Jane Smith: Well ... I ... I don't know really ... it's not the sort of question you ask yourself directly. I know I'm good at my job ... at least my boss calls me hard-working, conscientious, efficient. I'm a secretary by the way. As for when I look at myself in a mirror as it were ... you know ... you sometimes do in the privacy of your own bedroom ... or at your reflection in the ... in the shop windows as you walk up the street ... Well ... then I see someone a bit different. Yes ... I'm different in my private life. And that's probably my main fault I should say ... I'm not exactly — oh how shall I say?  — I suppose I'm, not coherent in my behaviour. My office is always in order...but my flat! Well...you'd have to see it to believe it. +

Chris Bonner: I think the question is irrelevant. You shouldn't be asking what I think of myself ... but what I think of the state of this country. And this country is in a terrible mess. There's only one hope for it — the National Front. It's law and order that we need. I say get rid of these thugs who call themselves Socialist Workers ... get rid of them I say. So don't ask about me. I'm the sort of ordinary decent person who wants to bring law and order back to this country. And if we can't do it by peaceful means then ... +

Tommy Finch: Think of myself? Well I'm an easy-going bloke really ... unless of course you wind me up. Then I'm a bit vicious. You know. I mean you have to live for yourself don't you. And think of your mates. That's what makes a bloke. I ain't got much sympathy like with them what's always thinking of causes ... civil rights and all that. I mean ... this is a free country inning? What do we want to fight for civil rights for? We've got them. +

Charles Dimmak: Well ... I'm retired you know. Used to be an army officer. And ... I think I've kept myself ... yes I've kept myself respectable — that's the word I'd use — respectable and dignified the whole of my life. I've tried to help those who depended on me. I've done my best. Perhaps you might consider me a bit of a fanatic about organization and discipline — self-discipline comes first — and all that sort of thing. But basically I'm a good chap ... not too polemic ... fond of my wife and family ... That's me. +

Arthur Fuller: Well ... when I was young I was very shy. At times I ... I was very unhappy ... especially when I was sent to boarding-school at seven. I didn't make close friends till ... till quite late in life ... till I was about ... what ... fifteen. Then I became quite good at being by myself. I had no one to rely on ... and no one to ask for advice. That made me independent ... and I've always solved my problems myself. My wife and I have two sons. We ... we didn't want an only child because I felt ... well I felt I'd missed a lot of things.


电视采访者：在本周的“与人同行”节目中，我们走上街头，问了一些人一个他们没想到的问题。我们要求他们进行自我批评……​问问自己，他们认为自己缺乏什么，或者——硬币的另一面——他们有什么美德。这是我们听到的。 +
简·史密斯：嗯……我……我真的不知道……这不是你直接问自己的问题。我知道我很擅长我的工作……至少我的老板称我勤奋、认真、高效。顺便说一句，我是一名秘书。至于当我在镜子里看着自己时……你知道……有时你会在自己卧室的私密空间里这样做……或者当你走在街上时，在商店橱窗里看到你的倒影……​嗯……​然后我看到了一个有点不同的人。是的……​我的私生活与众不同。我应该说，这可能是我的主要错误……我不完全是——哦，我该怎么说呢？ ——我想我的行为不连贯。我的办公室总是井然有序……但我的公寓！嗯……你必须亲眼所见才能相信。 +
克里斯·邦纳：我认为这个问题无关紧要。你不应该问我对自己的看法……​而是我对这个国家现状的看法。这个国家陷入了可怕的混乱。只有一个希望——国民阵线。我们需要的是法律和秩序。我说除掉这些自称为社会主义工人的暴徒……我说除掉他们。所以不要问我的事。我是那种普通正派的人，想把法律和秩序带回这个国家。如果我们不能通过和平方式做到这一点，那么……​ +
汤米·芬奇：想想我自己？嗯，我真的是一个随和的人……当然除非你让我生气。那我就有点恶毒了。你知道。我的意思是你必须为自己而活，不是吗？想想你的朋友们。这就是成为一个家伙的原因。我对他们并没有太多的同情，他们总是在思考原因……公民权利等等。我的意思是……​这是一场免费的乡村局？我们为什么要争取公民权利？我们有它们。 +
查尔斯·迪马克：嗯……我已经退休了，你知道。曾经是一名军官。而且……我想我一直保持自己……是的，我一直让自己受人尊敬——这是我会用的词——我一生都受人尊敬和有尊严。我试图帮助那些依赖我的人。我已经尽力了。也许你可能认为我对组织和纪律有点狂热——自律是第一位的——以及诸如此类的事情。但基本上我是一个好人……​不太好争论……​喜欢我的妻子和家人……​这就是我。 +
亚瑟·富勒：嗯……当我年轻的时候，我很害羞。有时我……我非常不开心……尤其是当我七岁时被送到寄宿学校时。我没有交到亲密的朋友，直到……直到生命的晚期……直到我大约……什么……十五岁。然后我就变得很擅长独处了。我没有人可以依靠……​也没有人可以寻求建议。这让我变得独立……​而且我总是自己解决我的问题。我和我的妻子有两个儿子。我们……我们不想要独生子，因为我觉得……好吧，我觉得我错过了很多东西。 +

1. Bert is a natural listener. He can lose himself in conversation with friends or family. Bert has a few very close friends, and he works hard to keep his friendships strong. +
2. One means of contact with friends is the regular exercise that Bert gets. He plays handball and swims with a friend twice every week. Besides that, he tries to stay in shape with morning exercises. Bert enjoys the exercise that he gets for its own sake as well as for the fact that it has kept him healthy all his life. +
3. In general, Adam has very few hobbies. He used to enjoy collecting coins and reading, but now can never find enough time. He has practically no release from his job and usually brings some work home with him. +
4. Like many modern Americans, neither man is very religious. Both belong to a church, but the religious services are not a sustaining part of their lives. But the difference in their spiritual makeup is nonetheless remarkable. +
5. Adam does not enjoy much self-confidence. He has never spent the time to think problems through carefully or to teach himself to think about other things. As a result, he is not a particularly creative problem solver. He spends quite a lot of time in compulsive, repetitive nervous activity which only frustrates him more. +
6. Heart attack victims who have tried to change their behaviour after their first heart attack report that Type B behaviour has given them a new sense of peace, freedom, and happiness. Not for anything in the world would they return to their old lifestyle, which held them trapped like prisoners in an unhappy world of their own making.

伯特是一个天生的倾听者。他可能会在与朋友或家人的交谈中迷失自我。伯特有一些非常亲密的朋友，他努力保持牢固的友谊。 +
伯特与朋友联系的一种方式是定期锻炼。他每周与朋友打两次手球并游泳。除此之外，他还尝试通过晨练来保持体形。伯特享受锻炼本身，也因为锻炼使他一生保持健康。 +
总的来说，亚当的爱好很少。他以前喜欢收集硬币和读书，但现在总是抽不出时间。他几乎没有从工作中解脱出来，通常会把一些工作带回家。 +
和许多现代美国人一样，两人都不太虔诚。两人都属于教堂，但宗教仪式并不是他们生活的维持部分。但他们的精神构成的差异仍然是显着的。 +
亚当不太自信。他从来没有花时间仔细思考问题，或者教会自己思考其他事情。因此，他并不是一个特别有创造力的问题解决者。他花了相当多的时间进行强迫性、重复性的神经活动，这只会让他更加沮丧。 +
第一次心脏病发作后试图改变自己行为的心脏病患者报告说，B 型行为给了他们一种新的平静、自由和幸福感。他们无论如何都不会回到原来的生活方式，这种生活方式让他们像囚犯一样被困在自己创造的不幸世界中。
