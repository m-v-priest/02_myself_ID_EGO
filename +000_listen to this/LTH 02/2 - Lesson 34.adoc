Lesson 34 +

== part


Like most of us, I was pretty skeptical about palmistry, and I still am to some extent, but I have found one or two interesting things which I'd like to mention. There are, in fact, three kinds of hand interpretation which have to be considered. Most people tend to think immediately of chiromancy when they hear about palmistry — the study of the lines on the hand. This suffers from a bad press, really, because of the gypsy fortune-teller associations it has, but I will explain more fully about that later. The second type of hand interpretation is called chirognomy. This is concerned with the shape of the hand, the thickness and form of the palm, length of fingers and thumb, flexibility and so on. Then dermatoglyphics is the name given to the study of the ridges and furrows which make a pattern on our hands. It is this, incidentally, which is the basis for police identification of fingerprints and so on. +
 +
I want to speak briefly today about the first two of these, which is where the bulk of my research was done, and I'll start by saying something about chirognomy. The hand is divided into four areas which I will briefly describe by using this diagram here on the screen. There is, by the way, a connection with astrology. The signs of the Zodiac are, for instance, divided into four distinct groups of three, linked to the four elements, as are modern hand shapes. Now, looking at the diagram, this area here, which includes the little finger, ring finger, half the middle finger and the area below all three, is the inner active area, and this area, area A, relates to close relationships, your love life and your relationship to your partner. Now the second area, B, is called the outer active area around the base of the index finger and the other half of the middle finger, and that relates to our social attitudes, what we might call our relationships to the outside world. Area C is the inner passive area, which lies below the inner active area, and relates to the subconscious part of the mind, and then last of all is the part relating to our energy and our creative potential, area D, which is the outer passive area ... right here, and the area all around the base of the thumb. +
 +
Now I can already hear you asking yourselves why should there be any connection between us — our character, that is — and our hands. Well, the only possible explanation I can give is that there is a large part of the brain concerned with the hand, and there are more nerve endings in the hand than elsewhere in the body, proportional to size, so it just may be — and I stress may be — that the traffic is two-way; that not only does the brain gain information from the hand, but also passes it back again. So, in this way the hand reflects the way the brain operates. +
 +
Now I'd like to say a word about the fingers, and this is where the connection with astrology can also be seen, in the names given to the individual fingers. These are taken from the names of the old Roman gods, just like the planets' names. The index finger is the finger of Jupiter, and in this can be seen the worldly tendencies of a person — ambition, life energy, prospects for success. The finger of Saturn is the name given to the middle finger, which reveals the presence of saturnine qualities, as the name would suggest — brooding, melancholy, that type of thing. The third finger or ring finger is the one with which we move towards inner concerns, and this is the finger of Apollo or the Sun. And finally, the little finger or finger of Mercury reveals a lot about human relationships. Palmists look, too, at the shape of the fingers and their flexibility and general position in relation to the hand. +
 +
Look now, if you will, at my second diagram where I've illustrated five types of fingers and I'll try to explain the characteristics people with these types of fingers are supposed to have. Now, the square shape illustrated here, where the nails and finger ends are squared off, this type reflects a cautious, thoughtful kind of person. Secondly, the spatulate type of finger, which you can see here, shaped like a spoon, narrow before the tip and then getting wider and flatter, these are the fingers of energetic and active people. Then the pointed type of finger with the tapering end; this belongs to the sensitive and artistic kind of person. Finger number three with the smooth joints indicates a quick-thinking and impulsive kind of character, and then finally the rather crooked type of finger with the knotty joints means a deep-thinking, dignified and methodical nature. +
 +
Now I've got another diagram to show you about chirognomy, and that concerns the little bumps we all have on the palm of our hand, which are said to reveal a whole lot about ourselves. Look first, if you will, at the mount of Venus, which is situated at the base of the thumb. This, you may remember, is the area of the hand relating to energy and creativity. Notice, too, the signs used to indicate these bumps: Venus, for example, as in astrology, is shown by the female sign of a circle and a cross underneath it. In the hand where this mount is very flat and under-developed it implies a person with a detached and self-contained nature. Where it is large it implies a person with lots of vitality, and where normal-sized it implies a person who is healthy, warm-hearted and sincere, with plenty of compassion. Moving across to the other side of the hand opposite the mount of Venus but, like it, just above the wrist, is the mount of the Moon. A normal-sized mount of this kind will supposedly be indicative of a sensitive, romantic and imaginative type. If flat, the contrary is indicated, that is, an unimaginative, possibly unstable and even bigoted character. Where it is large, then we can interpret that as being a person who is over-imaginative and introspective. Directly above the mount of the Moon is the upper mount of Mars. It would seem that it's best to have a normal-sized one of these, because if this is the case you are meant to be morally courageous. If it's flat, then you're cowardly, and if it's large you're bad-tempered and cruel. We'll contrast this with the lower mount of Mars on the far side of the hand, above the mount of Venus I spoke about first of all. With this mount, if it's normal size you're meant to be physically brave and not a panicky sort of person; you're violent and argumentative if it's large. and cowardly if it's flat. The other four mounts are at the base of the fingers, the mount of Jupiter lies below the index finger, and next to that the mount of Saturn. Below the ring finger, here, is the mount of Apollo, and then next to that is the mount of Mercury. In the first of these four, the mount of Jupiter, if your mount is flat then that means you are a selfish, lazy individual, and if it's normal that is supposed to indicate enthusiasm, self-confidence and friendliness, whereas if large it would indicate an overbearing and very ambitious nature. The next one right beside it, Saturn, if normal would mean a serious and studious type of personality, and if flat would seem to indicate dullness, and if large a gloomy, reclusive and withdrawn nature, none of which is very promising. The mount of Apollo, when normal, corresponds to a lucky, sunny and pleasant nature, but if flat would indicate a lack of purpose and a philistine nature. Where this mount is large, an extravagant, hedonistic and pleasure-seeking nature would seem to be implied. Finally I'll come to the mount of Mercury, and where this is of normal size it would seem to indicate a lively, persuasive and hard-working character; where flat a gullible and humourless one, and where large a person with a good sense of humour. I'd like now to ...

像我们大多数人一样，我对手相术非常怀疑，在某种程度上我仍然如此，但我发现了一两件有趣的事情我想提一下。事实上，必须考虑三种手牌解释。大多数人一听到手相术（研究手上的纹路）就会立即想到手相术。事实上，由于它与吉普赛算命师的联系，它受到了不好的报道，但我稍后会对此进行更全面的解释。第二种手部解释称为手相学。这与手的形状、手掌的厚度和形状、手指和拇指的长度、灵活性等有关。皮纹学是对我们手上形成图案的脊线和皱纹进行研究的名称。顺便说一句，这也是警方识别指纹等的基础。


今天我想简单谈谈其中的前两个，这是我的大部分研究完成的地方，我将首先谈谈手相学。手分为四个区域，我将使用屏幕上的图表对其进行简要描述。顺便说一下，这与占星学有联系。例如，黄道带的标志被分为四个不同的组，每组三个，与四个元素相关，就像现代的手形一样。现在，看图，这里的这个区域，包括小指、无名指、中指的一半以及这三个手指下方的区域，是内部活动区域，这个区域，A区域，与亲密关系有关，你的热爱生活以及你与伴侣的关系。现在，第二个区域 B 被称为食指根部和中指另一半周围的外部活动区域，这与我们的社会态度有关，我们可以称之为我们与外部世界的关系。 C区是内在被动区，位于内在主动区下方，与心灵的潜意识部分相关，最后是与我们的能量和创造潜力相关的部分，D区，这是外在的区域。被动区域……就在这里，以及拇指根部周围的区域。


现在我已经能听到你们在问自己，为什么我们——我们的性格——和我们的手之间应该有任何联系。好吧，我能给出的唯一可能的解释是，大脑的很大一部分与手有关，而且手上的神经末梢比身体其他部位的神经末梢更多，与大小成正比，所以它可能是——而且我强调的可能是——交通是双向的；大脑不仅能从手上获取信息，还能将其再次传递回来。因此，通过这种方式，手反映了大脑的运作方式。


现在我想谈谈手指，从各个手指的名称中也可以看出与占星学的联系。这些名字取自古罗马众神的名字，就像行星的名字一样。食指是木星的手指，从中可以看出一个人的世俗倾向——野心、生命能量、成功的前景。土星之指是中指的名字，顾名思义，它揭示了土星特质的存在——沉思、忧郁之类的东西。无名指或无名指是我们走向内心关注的一根手指，这是阿波罗或太阳的手指。最后，水星的小指或手指揭示了很多关于人际关系的信息。手相学家也会观察手指的形状、灵活性以及相对于手的一般位置。


现在，如果您愿意的话，请看我的第二张图表，其中我展示了五种类型的手指，我将尝试解释具有这些类型手指的人应该具有的特征。现在，如图所示的方形形状，指甲和指尖呈方形，这种类型反映出谨慎、深思熟虑的人。其次，你可以看到这里的匙形手指，形状像勺子，尖端前窄，然后变宽变平，这些是精力充沛、活跃的人的手指。然后是末端逐渐变细的尖头型手指；这属于敏感且有艺术气质的人。三号手指，关节光滑，代表思维敏捷、冲动，而弯曲手指，关节多节，则代表思考深沉、端庄、有条理。


现在我有另一张图表向您展示手相学，它涉及我们手掌上的小肿块，据说可以揭示我们自己的很多信息。如果你愿意的话，首先看看位于拇指根部的金星丘。您可能还记得，这是与能量和创造力相关的手部区域。还要注意用于指示这些凹凸的标志：例如，在占星学中，金星由圆形的女性符号和其下方的十字表示。如果手上的坐骑非常平坦且不发达，则意味着此人具有超然和自足的性格。如果它大，则意味着这个人精力充沛；如果它正常，则意味着这个人身体健康，热心真诚，富有同情心。移动到手的另一侧，与金星山相对，但与它一样，在手腕上方，是月亮山。这种正常尺寸的坐骑据说代表着敏感、浪漫和富有想象力的类型。如果是扁平的，则表明相反，即缺乏想象力，可能不稳定，甚至偏执的性格。如果它很大，那么我们可以将其解释为一个过度想象力和内省的人。月球山的正上方是火星的上山。似乎最好有一个正常尺寸的，因为如果是这样的话，你就意味着在道德上有勇气。如果它是平的，那么你就是懦弱的人，如果它是大的，那么你就是脾气暴躁、残忍的。我们将把它与手的远端的较低的火星山进行对比，火星山位于我首先提到的金星山的上方。 有了这个坐骑，如果它是正常尺寸，那么你应该是一个勇敢的人，而不是一个惊慌失措的人；如果事情规模很大，你就会变得暴力和好争论。如果是平坦的，那就是懦弱的。其他四个丘在手指根部，木星丘位于食指下方，紧邻土星丘。在无名指下方，这里是阿波罗山，然后旁边是水星山。在这四个中的第一个，木星山，如果你的山是平的，那么意味着你是一个自私、懒惰的人，如果是正常的，则应该表明热情、自信和友善，反之，如果是大的，则表明你是一个自私、懒惰的人。表明性格专横且野心勃勃。旁边的下一个是土星，如果正常，则意味着性格严肃、好学；如果平，则似乎表明迟钝；如果大，则性格阴沉、隐居、孤僻，这些都不是很有前途的。阿波罗山正常时代表幸运、阳光和愉快的性格，但如果平坦则表示缺乏目标和庸俗的性格。坐骑大的地方，似乎就隐含着奢侈、享乐、享乐的本性。最后我会来到水星山，在正常大小的地方，它似乎表明了一个活泼、有说服力和勤奋的性格；扁平的人是容易上当受骗、缺乏幽默感的人，而大的人则是具有良好幽默感的人。 我现在想……​

In the Philippines today, Cardinal Haimi Sung, the influential Archbishop of Manila, endorsed President Corazon Aquino's efforts to negotiate with Communist insurgence of the New People's Army. Leaders of the Philippine military, however, and members of her own cabinet have criticized Aquino's attempts at negotiation. The NPA rebels had proposed a one-hundred-day cease-fire to begin in December. +
 +
A group of civilian negotiators and military advisers will meet tomorrow with rebel leaders to discuss the possible truce. Garis Porter, an assistant professor at the American University's School of International Service, says the rebel proposal is a response to President Aquino's earlier offer for a thirty-day cease-fire. +
 +
"I think they're proposing a hundred-day cease-fire primarily because they want to regain initiative, because they do have to have the appearance of being open to a cease-fire, in fact, being at least as open to cease-fire as the government is. The real question, of course, is what terms the cease-fire will be implemented on. And there is where you are going to find a lot of worms which neither side, I think, is really quite clear on exactly what they're yet ready to settle for." +
 +
"They suggested five talking points. And some of those talking points I would think could meet with some pretty stiff opposition from the Philippine military." +
 +
"Well, there's no question that the military is going to oppose, at least a couple of them very strongly." +
 +
"Such as which one?" +
 +
"The first one, the most important one, I think for both sides at this point is the disposition of the Philippine military, the New Armed Forces of the Philippines, NAFP, during a cease-fire. The Communists have, from the beginning, made it clear that they would insist on the pull back of NAFP units from areas which they claim to control. And the military, on the other hand, has also made equally clear that they reject any terms which would not allow them to claim clear control of all of the countryside. +
 +
"Is President Corazon Aquino being naive, as some of her military officials suggest, and thinking that she can negotiate some kind of cease-fire agreement with the Communists that will not ultimately work to their advantage?" +
 +
"I don't think 'naive' is the term to describe Aquino's policy towards the insurgency. There are two points here. One is that she understands that the intentions of the Communist side are at best unclear in terms of the cease-fire. She understands they have their own interests and cease-fire will fit into those interests in a way that may or may not be an interest to the government. The other point, however, I think this is more important to her and perhaps objectively more important in looking at the situation. She understands that the military on her side is simply not capable of controlling the NPA through military means. And by threatening to unleash the military she may actually be making a threat which does not have much credibility. But I think she would almost do anything possible to put off having to go to primarily military strategy for dealing with the insurgency. So in a sense she is playing for time." +
 +
"If they manage to agree on a cease-fire, then what happens after that? What happens when the hundred days is up?" +
 +
"Nobody wants to be the first one to break the cease-fire once it's put into effect. So I think the agreement to a hundred-day cease-fire is, ... has much longer term and much broader implication, if in fact they could come to that agreement, which at this point I think it is still very much up in the air." +
 +
"If it fails, if it fails, does that mean an escalation in the military complex?" +
 +
"Well, I think the pressures on Aquino for letting the military go back its preferred strategy, attempting to go on the offensive, to carry out major military operations, particularly in Central Luzon and in the Southern Tagalog, that is south of Manila, is very strong. And that she will probably make concession to the military which will allow it to resume the offenses to, at least, try that out." +

今天在菲律宾，颇具影响力的马尼拉大主教海米·宋枢机支持总统科拉松·阿基诺与新人民军的共产党叛乱进行谈判的努力。然而，菲律宾军方领导人和内阁成员批评了阿基诺的谈判尝试。新人民军叛军提议从十二月开始实行一百天停火。


一群文职谈判代表和军事顾问将于明天与叛军领导人会面，讨论可能的停战协议。美利坚大学国际服务学院助理教授加里斯·波特表示，叛军的提议是对阿基诺总统早些时候提出的三十天停火提议的回应。


“我认为他们提出一百天停火主要是因为他们想重新获得主动权，因为他们必须表现出对停火持开放态度，事实上，至少对停火持开放态度——政府正在开火。当然，真正的问题是停火将在什么条件下实施。你会发现很多蠕虫，我认为双方都不太清楚这正是他们尚未准备好接受的。”


“他们提出了五个谈话要点。我认为其中一些谈话要点可能会遭到菲律宾军方的强烈反对。”


“嗯，毫无疑问，军方会反对，至少有一些会非常强烈地反对。”


“比如哪一个？”


“第一个，也是最重要的一个，我认为目前对双方来说，是菲律宾军队、菲律宾新武装部队（NAFP）在停火期间的部署。共产党从一开始就明确表示他们将坚持要求 NAFP 部队从他们声称控制的地区撤出。而另一方面，军方也同样明确表示他们拒绝任何不允许他们声称拥有明确控制权的条款所有乡村的。


“科拉松·阿基诺总统是否像她的一些军事官员所暗示的那样天真，认为她可以与共产党谈判达成某种最终不会对他们有利的停火协议？”


“我不认为‘天真的’这个词可以形容阿基诺对叛乱的政策。这里有两点。一是她明白共产党方面在停火方面的意图充其量是不明确的。她明白他们有自己的利益，停火将以一种可能符合或可能不符合政府利益的方式符合这些利益。然而，我认为这对她来说更重要，也许客观上更重要从目前的情况看，她明白自己这边的军方根本没有能力通过军事手段控制新人民军。而且她威胁要释放军队，实际上可能是在发出没有多大可信度的威胁。但我认为“她几乎会尽一切可能推迟主要采取军事战略来应对叛乱。所以从某种意义上说，她是在争取时间。”


“如果他们设法达成停火协议，那么之后会发生什么？百日结束后会发生什么？”


“一旦停火协议生效，没有人愿意成为第一个打破停火协议的人。因此，我认为百日停火协议......具有更长期和更广泛的影响，如果事实上他们能否达成协议，目前我认为这仍然是一个悬而未决的事情。”


“如果失败了，如果失败了，是否意味着军事综合体的升级？”


“嗯，我认为阿基诺让军队回到其首选战略，试图继续进攻，开展重大军事行动，特别是在吕宋岛中部和马尼拉以南的南他加禄语地区，所面临的压力是非常强烈。而且她可能会向军方做出让步，允许军方恢复进攻，至少尝试一下。”

== Technology and the Future (I) +

The title of my talk is 'Technology and the Future', and it's only fair to start with a couple of warnings. I have never been interested in the near future — only the more distant one. So if you take my predictions too seriously, you'll go broke; but if your children don't take them seriously enough, they'll go broke. I'll deal first with transportation and communication, because they are inextricably linked together and do more than anything else to shape society. For near-earth applications, both communication and transportation may now be approaching their practical limits and may reach them by the turn of the century. +
 +
For terrestrial transportation, I don't see any real need for much advance beyond the currently planned supersonic transports, operating at almost two thousand miles per hour. +
 +
True, one could build pure rocket vehicles to go from pole to pole in about one hour, but I don't think the public will enjoy fifteen minutes of high acceleration and fifteen minutes of high deceleration, separated by half an hour of complete weightlessness. +
 +
Rather more practical, and of much more immediate importance, will be ground-effect vehicles, or hovercraft. I think we'll have them in the thousand-ton and ten-thousand ton class by the end of the century. +
 +
The political effect of such vehicles may be enormous, as they can go over land and sea and can cross most reasonable obstacles as if they aren't there. You could have the great 'ports' of the world at the centre of the continents, if you wanted to. +
 +
That private hovercraft will ever be popular, I rather doubt. They are noisy and have poor efficiency and poor control. (You can't put on the brakes in a hurry if you're riding on a bubble of air.) However, they are splendid for opening up terrain where conventional vehicles cannot travel — such as shallow rivers, swamps, ice fields, coral reefs at low tide, and similar types of fascinating and now inaccessible wilderness. +
 +
I hope to see the automatic car before I die. Personally, I refuse to drive a car — I won't have anything to do with any kind of transport in which I can't read. I can see a time when it's illegal for a human being to drive a car on a main highway. +
 +
More seriously, we'll certainly have to get rid of the petrol engine, and everybody is now waking up to the urgent necessity of this. Apart from the facts of air pollution, we have much more important uses for petroleum than burning it. +
 +
To make non-petrol cars and other vehicles practical, we need some new power source. Fuel cells are already here, but they are only a marginal improvement. I don't know how we're going to do it, but we want something at least a hundred times lighter and more compact than present batteries.



科技与未来（一）
我演讲的标题是“技术与未来”，从一些警告开始是公平的。我对不久的将来从来不感兴趣——只对更遥远的未来感兴趣。所以，如果你太认真地对待我的预测，你就会破产；但如果你的孩子没有足够认真地对待它们，他们就会破产。我将首先讨论交通和通讯，因为它们密不可分地联系在一起，并且对塑造社会的作用比其他任何东西都重要。对于近地应用，通信和运输现在可能已接近其实际极限，并可能在世纪之交达到其实际极限。


对于陆地运输，我认为除了当前计划的超音速运输（每小时运行速度近 2000 英里）之外，没有任何实际需要。


确实，人们可以制造出纯粹的火箭车辆，在大约一小时内从一个极点到达另一个极点，但我不认为公众会享受十五分钟的高加速和十五分钟的高减速，中间间隔半小时的完全失重。


更实用、更直接重要的是地效飞行器或气垫船。我认为到本世纪末我们将拥有千吨级和万吨级。


此类车辆的政治影响可能是巨大的，因为它们可以穿越陆地和海洋，并且可以跨越最合理的障碍，就好像它们不存在一样。如果你愿意的话，你可以在各大洲的中心拥有世界上伟大的“港口”。


我很怀疑私人气垫船是否会流行。它们噪音大、效率低、控制能力差。 （如果你骑在气泡上，你就不能急刹车。）然而，它们非常适合开辟传统车辆无法行驶的地形——例如浅河、沼泽、冰原、珊瑚退潮时的珊瑚礁，以及类似类型的迷人但现在难以进入的荒野。


我希望在死之前能看到自动挡汽车。就我个人而言，我拒绝开车——我不会乘坐任何我无法阅读的交通工具。我可以想象有一天，在主要高速公路上驾驶汽车是违法的。


更严重的是，我们肯定必须摆脱汽油发动机，现在每个人都意识到了这一点的迫切必要性。除了空气污染这一事实之外，石油还有比燃烧更重要的用途。


为了使非汽油汽车和其他车辆实用化，我们需要一些新的动力源。燃料电池已经出现，但它们只是一个微小的改进。我不知道我们将如何做到这一点，但我们想要比现有电池至少轻一百倍、更紧凑的东西。
