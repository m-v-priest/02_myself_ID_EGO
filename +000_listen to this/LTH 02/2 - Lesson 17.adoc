Here is a summary of the news.

Shots are fired in a south London street by escaping bank robbers. Four rock fans die in a stampede at a concert Chicago. And how an Air France Concorde was involved in the closest recorded miss in aviation history?

Shots were fired this morning in the course of an 80 m.p.h. chase along Brixton High Road in London. A police constable was injured by flying glass when a bullet shattered his windscreen as he was pursuing a car containing four men who had earlier raided a branch of Barclays Bank at Stockwell. Police Constable Robert Cranley had been patrolling near the bank when the alarm was given. The raiders made their getaway in a stolen Jaguar which was later found abandoned in Croydon. Officials of the bank later announced that ￡16,000 had been stolen.

Four people were killed and more than fifty injured when fans rushed to get into a stadium in Chicago yesterday where the British pop group Fantasy were giving a concert. The incident occurred when gates were opened to admit a huge crowd of young people waiting outside the stadium for the sale of unreserved seat tickets. People were knocked over in the rush and trampled underfoot as the crowd surged forward. The concert later went ahead as planned with Fantasy unaware of what had happened. A police spokesman said that they had decided to allow the concert to proceed in order to avoid further trouble. There has been criticism of the concert organizers for not ensuring that all the tickets were sold in advance. Roy Thompson, leader of Fantasy, said afterwards that the whole group was 'shattered' when they heard what had happened. They are now considering calling off the rest of their United States tour.

The United States Air Force has admitted that a formation of its fighters and an Air France Concorde recently missed colliding by as little as 10 feet. The Air Force accepts the blame for what was the closest recorded miss in aviation history. According to the Air Force spokesman, when the Concorde was already 70 miles out over the Atlantic, on a scheduled flight to Paris from Dulles International Airport, Washington, four US Air Force F-15s approached at speed from the left. The lead plane missed the underside of Concorde’s nose by 10 feet while another passed only 15 feet in front of the cockpit.

Forest fires in the South of France have claimed the life of another fireman as they continue to rage in the hills between Frejus and Cannes. Fanned by strong westerly winds the flames are now threatening several villages and many holiday homes have had to be abandoned. The French army was called in yesterday to assist the fifteen hundred fire fighters that have so far been unable to contain the spread of the blaze.

A demonstration against race prejudice drew thousands of people to central London this morning. It was organized by the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress under the banner 'United against Racialism'. The march was led by several leading Labour Party and Trades Union officials. It was a column that stretched for over two miles and it took the demonstrators nearly three hours to cover the distance from Speakers' Corner to Trafalgar Square. There were representatives from more than twenty major unions, as well as community workers and various ethnic groups. By the time the march reached Trafalgar Square an estimated fifteen thousand people had joined it.

Heathrow Airport Police are investigating how a mailbag containing nearly ￡750,000 worth of jewels went missing between Geneva and London. The mailbag was believed to be on its way to a London dealer from a jeweller in Geneva five weeks ago, but it was not realized it was missing until the Post Office reported the fact to Scotland Yard two days ago. The mailbag contained a diamond, an emerald and two rubies valued at ￡635,200 plus a number of stones of lesser value, according to a police spokesman at Heathrow.

Football. The draw for the semi-final of the F.A. Cup was made earlier today. Liverpool will play Manchester City while Arsenal will meet Nottingham Forest. And that’s the end of the news.

今天早上，在时速 80 英里的赛道上发生了枪击事件。沿着伦敦布里克斯顿高路追逐。一名警员在追赶一辆载有四名男子的汽车时，一颗子弹打碎了他的挡风玻璃，这名警员被飞溅的玻璃击伤，这辆汽车早些时候袭击了巴克莱银行位于斯托克韦尔的一家分行。警报响起时，警官罗伯特·克兰利正在银行附近巡逻。袭击者驾驶一辆偷来的捷豹汽车逃跑，后来发现这辆汽车被遗弃在克罗伊登。该银行官员随后宣布16,000英镑被盗。 +

昨天，英国流行乐队 Fantasy 正在芝加哥举行音乐会，歌迷们冲进一个体育场，造成四人死亡、五十多人受伤。事件发生时，大门打开，一大群年轻人在体育场外等待出售未预订的座位票。人们在拥挤的人群中被撞倒，被踩在脚下。音乐会随后按计划进行，Fantasy 并不知道发生了什么事。警方发言人表示，他们决定允许音乐会继续进行，以避免进一步的麻烦。有人批评音乐会组织者没有确保所有门票提前售完。幻想乐队的领导人罗伊·汤普森事后表示，当他们听到所发生的事情时，整个乐队都“崩溃了”。他们现在正在考虑取消剩余的美国巡演。 +

美国空军承认，其战斗机编队与法航协和式飞机最近发生了仅 10 英尺的碰撞事故。空军接受了航空历史上有记录的最接近的失误的责任。据空军发言人称，当协和式飞机在从华盛顿杜勒斯国际机场飞往巴黎的定期航班上飞到大西洋上空 70 英里时，四架美国空军 F-15 战斗机从左侧高速接近。主机与协和式飞机机头下方相距 10 英尺，而另一架飞机仅在驾驶舱前方 15 英尺处飞过。 +

法国南部的森林大火在弗雷瑞斯和戛纳之间的山上继续肆虐，导致另一名消防员丧生。在强劲西风的推动下，大火现在威胁着几个村庄，许多度假屋不得不被放弃。昨天，法国军队被召集来协助 1500 名消防员，但迄今为止，他们仍无法控制火势的蔓延。 +

Today I would like to tell you about the effects of old age on health. Actually today a lot of improvements have taken place in the care of old people and old people’s health is not nearly so bad as it used to be.

Probably many of the fears that people have of growing old are greatly exaggerated. Most people, for example, dread becoming senile. But in fact very few people become senile. Perhaps only about 15% of those over 65 become senile. Actually a much more common problem is in fact caused by we doctors ourselves. And that is over-medication. Nearly 80% of people over 65 have at least one serious illness, such as high blood pressure, hearing difficulty or heart disease. And very often to combat these they take a number of drugs and of course sometimes there are interaction among those drugs as well as simply being too many. And this can cause a lot of complications from mental confusions, very commonly, to disturbance of the heart rhythm. So this is a problem that doctors have to watch out for.

Probably the most ignored disorder among old people is depression. Maybe about 15% of older people suffer from this condition. A lot of it is caused by this over-medication which we mentioned.

Although it is better now for old people, we have to admit that the body does change as we grow older. The immune system starts to decline and there are changes in metabolism, lungs, the senses, the brain and the skin.

So what should an old person do to counter-act these changes?

He or she should eat a balanced diet — not too much fat — chicken or fish should be eaten rather than eggs or beef. Eat more high fibre and vitamin rich foods, such as vegetables and fruit.

The old person should give up smoking if he hasn’t already done so. He should also do regular exercise — at least half an hour, three times a week. No section of the population can benefit more from exercise than the elderly.



今天我想向大家介绍一下老年对健康的影响。事实上，现在老年人的护理已经有了很大的进步，老年人的健康状况也不像以前那么糟糕了。 +

也许人们对变老的许多恐惧都被过分夸大了。例如，大多数人都害怕变老。但事实上，很少有人会衰老。 65 岁以上的人中，也许只有约 15% 会衰老。事实上，一个更常见的问题实际上是我们医生自己造成的。这就是过度用药。近 80% 65 岁以上的人患有至少一种严重疾病，例如高血压、听力困难或心脏病。为了对抗这些疾病，他们经常服用多种药物，当然有时这些药物之间会相互作用，甚至药物太多。这可能会导致许多并发症，从精神错乱（很常见）到心律紊乱。所以这是医生必须警惕的问题。 +

老年人中最容易被忽视的疾病可能是抑郁症。也许大约 15% 的老年人患有这种疾病。很多都是我们提到的过度用药造成的。 +

虽然现在老年人好了一些，但我们不得不承认，随着年龄的增长，身体确实会发生变化。免疫系统开始衰退，新陈代谢、肺部、感官、大脑和皮肤都发生变化。 +

那么，老年人应该如何应对这些变化呢？ +

他或她应该均衡饮食——不要吃太多脂肪——应该吃鸡肉或鱼，而不是鸡蛋或牛肉。多吃高纤维和富含维生素的食物，如蔬菜和水果。 +

如果老人还没有戒烟，就应该戒烟。他还应该定期锻炼——至少半小时，每周三次。没有哪个群体比老年人更能从锻炼中受益。 +

Carl: I hope I'm not interrupting your work, Mr. Thornton. You must be very busy at this time of the day. +

Paul: Not at all. Come in, come in, Mr. Finch. I'm just tasting a few of the dishes we'll be serving this morning. +

Carl: That looks interesting. What exactly is it? +

Paul: That one is fish — in a special sauce. One of my new creations, actually. +

Carl: I'm looking forward to trying it. +

Paul: I do hope you've enjoyed your stay with us. +

Carl: Very much, indeed. We both find it very relaxing here. +

Paul: Well, I'm sure there's lots more you'd like to ask, so, please, go ahead. +

Carl: Thanks. I notice that you have a sort of team of helpers. How do you organize who does what? Surely it's difficult with so many talented people? +

Paul: Everyone contributes ideas, of course, and to a certain extent shares in the decision-making. We all have our different specialities and different ways of doing things, but that's a great advantage in a place like this. If there is any disagreement, I have the final word. After all, I own the business and I'm the boss. But it happens very rarely. I'm glad to say. +

Carl: Have you had them with you for long? +

Paul: Not all of them, no. Alan's been with me for about five years. I used to have a restaurant on the east coast. Then I got the offer to do a lecture tour of Australia and New Zealand, you know, with practical demonstrations, so I sold the business, and then Alan and I looked around for two young chefs to take with us. Tom and Martin have been working for me ever since (Laughs.) Chefs are not a problem, but I'm having a lot of trouble at the moment finding good, reliable domestic staff. +

Carl: How long did the tour last? +

Paul: We were away for over two years in the end because more and more organizations wanted to see the show, and one thing led to another. +

Carl: Had you been considering this present venture for long? +

Paul: For some time, yes. During the tour I began to think it might be interesting to combine the show idea with a permanent establishment. And so here we are. +

Carl: And what made you choose this particular spot? +

Paul: Quite a few people have been surprised — you're not the first. It does seem a bit out of the way, I know, but I didn't want to start up in London. There's far too much competition. Then I decided to go for a different type of client altogether — the sort of person who wants to get away from it all; who loves peace and quiet, and beautiful scenery but also appreciates good food. When I saw the farmhouse I couldn't resist it. I was brought up not far from here so everything just fell into place. +

Carl: To go back to the food, Paul. Do you have a large selection of dishes to choose from or are you always looking for new ideas? +

Paul: Both. A lot of the dishes had already been created on the tour, but I encourage my staff to experiment whenever possible. I mean I can't keep serving the same dishes. The people who come here expect something unusual at every course, and some guests, I hope, will want to return. +

Carl: I know two who certainly will. +

Paul: It's very kind of you to say so. Is there anything else you'd like to know? +

Carl: As a matter of fact, there is. Your grapefruit and ginger marmalade tastes delicious. Could you possibly give me the recipe? +

Paul: It isn't really my secret to give. It belongs to Alan, but I'm sure if you ask him he'll be glad to oblige you — as long as you promise not to print it in your magazine!


卡尔：我希望我没有打扰您的工作，桑顿先生。一天中的这个时候你一定很忙。 +

保罗：一点也不。进来，进来，芬奇先生。我只是品尝我们今天早上提供的一些菜肴。 +

卡尔：看起来很有趣。到底是什么？ +

保罗：那是鱼——配上一种特殊的酱汁。实际上，这是我的新创作之一。 +

卡尔：我很期待尝试一下。 +

保罗：我衷心希望您在我们这里过得愉快。 +

卡尔：确实非常喜欢。我们都觉得这里非常放松。 +

保罗：嗯，我确信您还有很多问题想问，所以，请继续。 +

卡尔：谢谢。我注意到你有一个助手团队。你如何组织谁做什么？这么多人才，肯定很难吧？ +

Paul：当然，每个人都贡献想法，并在一定程度上参与决策。我们都有不同的专长和不同的做事方式，但这在这样的地方是一个很大的优势。如果有任何不同意见，我有最终决定权。毕竟，我拥有这家公司，我是老板。但这种情况很少发生。我很高兴地说。 +

卡尔：你带着它们很久了吗？ +

保罗：不是全部，不是。艾伦和我在一起大约五年了。我以前在东海岸有一家餐馆。然后我得到了在澳大利亚和新西兰进行巡回演讲的邀请，你知道，并进行实际演示，所以我卖掉了公司，然后艾伦和我四处寻找两位年轻的厨师可以带我们一起去。从那时起，汤姆和马丁就一直为我工作（笑）。厨师不是问题，但我目前在寻找优秀、可靠的家政人员方面遇到了很多麻烦。 +

卡尔：这次巡演持续了多长时间？ +

Paul：我们最终离开了两年多，因为越来越多的组织想看这个节目，一件事导致了另一件事。 +

卡尔：您考虑目前的这项事业很久了吗？ +

保罗：有一段时间，是的。在参观过程中，我开始认为将展览理念与永久性设施结合起来可能会很有趣。我们就到这里了。 +

卡尔：是什么让你选择了这个特定地点？ +

保罗：很多人都感到惊讶——你不是第一个。我知道，这似乎有点偏僻，但我不想在伦敦创业。竞争太多了。然后我决定去寻找完全不同类型的客户——那种想要摆脱一切的人；喜欢宁静、美丽的风景，也喜欢美食。当我看到农舍时，我无法抗拒。我是在离这里不远的地方长大的，所以一切都很顺利。 +

卡尔：回到食物上来，保罗。您是否有大量菜肴可供选择，或者您总是在寻找新创意？ +

保罗：两者都有。很多菜肴已经在巡演中制作完成，但我鼓励我的员工尽可能进行尝试。我的意思是我不能一直提供同样的菜肴。来到这里的人们期望每道菜都有不同寻常的东西，我希望有些客人会想回来。 +

卡尔：我知道有两个人肯定会的。 +

保罗：你这么说真是太好了。您还有什么想知道的吗？ +

卡尔：事实上，是有的。你的柚子和生姜果酱味道鲜美。你能给我菜谱吗？ +

保罗：奉献并不是我的秘密。它属于艾伦，但我相信如果你问他，他会很乐意满足你——只要你保证不把它印在你的杂志上！ +

Shelagh: Um, it's another one of my adventures as a tourist, um, finding out things you really didn't expect to find out when you went to the place! I went to Pompeii and of course what you go to Pompeii for is, er, the archaeology. +

Liz: To see the ruins. +

Shelagh: To see the ruins. And I was actually seeing the ruins but, um, suddenly my attention was caught by something else. I was just walking round the corner of a ruin, into a group of trees, pine trees, and I was just looking at them, admiring them and suddenly I saw a man halfway up this tree, and I was looking at him so all I could see was his hands and his feet and he was about 20 or 30 feet up. I thought, 'Goodness, what's going on here. Has he got a ladder or hasn't he?' So I walked round to see if he had a ladder. No, he had just gone straight up the tree. +

Liz: He'd shinned up the tree. +

Shelagh: He'd shinned up the tree. Like a monkey, more or less, except he was a rather middle-aged monkey ... He was, er, he was all of 50 and (Oh God), what's going on here? Anyway, I walked a bit further and saw other people either up trees or preparing to go up trees, and then I noticed a man standing there directing them, a sort of foreman, and began to wonder what on earth was going on, and then on the ground I saw there were all these polythene buckets and they were full of pine cones and of course what they were doing was collecting pine cones, and I thought, 'Well, how tidy of them to collect pine cones to stop the ruins being, um, made, um, made untidy with all these things.' Then I saw there was a lorry ... full of pine cones ... This was getting ridiculous ... They were really collecting them in a big way. So I, um, asked the, er, foreman what was going on and he said, 'Well you know, um, pine nuts are extremely sought after and valuable in the food industry in Italy.' +

Liz: For food (Yeah). Not fuel! I thought you were going to say they were going to put (burn) them on a fire. Yes. +

Shelagh: Well, they might burn the, er, cones when they've finished with them but inside these cones are little white things like nuts and, er, I realized that they're used in Italian cooking quite a lot in, er, there's a particular sauce that goes with spaghetti, em, from Genova, I think, called 'pesto' in which these nuts are ground up and of course they come in cakes and sweets and things like that. +

Liz: So it's quite a delicacy. +

Shelagh: It's quite a delicacy. And of course I'd never thought of how they actually got them 'cos you can't imagine having a pine nut farm. So what he said happens is that private firms like his buy a licence off the Italian State for the right to go round places like Pompeii — archaeological sites and things — and systematically collect all the pine cones that come off the trees and similarly in the, in the forests. +

Liz: And of course they have to go up the tree because by the time it's fallen the, the food isn't any good. +

Shelagh: That's right. They're pulling them down and he said they were very good at, um, recognizing which ones were ready and which ones were a bit hard and etc. And each of them had a sort of stick with a hook at the end which they were using to pull the pines off, off the trees but clearly it wasn't enough to sit around and wait till they fell down. You, you had to do something about it. There they were. So that was, er, the end of my looking at the ruins for about half an hour. I was too fascinated by this, er, strange form of er, agriculture. +

Liz: Well, what you don't intend to see is always the most interesting. +

Shelagh: Much more interesting.

Shelagh：嗯，这是我作为一名游客的另一次冒险，嗯，发现了你去那个地方时真正没想到会发现的东西！我去了庞贝城，当然你去庞贝城是为了呃考古。 +

莉兹：去看废墟。 +

Shelagh：去看废墟。我实际上看到了废墟，但是，嗯，突然我的注意力被其他东西吸引了。我正绕着废墟的拐角走，走进一群树，松树，我只是看着它们，欣赏它们，突然我看到一个人在这棵树的半路上，我看着他，所以我可以看到他的手和脚，他大约有 20 或 30 英尺高。我想，‘天哪，这是怎么回事。他有梯子吗？于是我绕过去看看他是否有梯子。不，他刚刚直接爬上了树。 +

莉兹：他已经爬上树了。 +

Shelagh：他已经爬上树了。或多或少像一只猴子，只不过他是一只相当中年的猴子……他，呃，他都 50 岁了，（天哪），这里发生了什么事？不管怎样，我又走了一点，看到其他人要么上树，要么准备上树，然后我注意到一个人站在那里指挥他们，有点像工头，我开始想知道到底发生了什么事，然后我看到地上有很多聚乙烯桶，里面装满了松果，当然他们所做的就是收集松果，我想，‘好吧，他们收集松果以防止废墟被毁，真是太整洁了。 ，嗯，所有这些东西都弄得乱七八糟。然后我看到有一辆卡车…​装满了松果…​这太荒谬了…​他们真的在大规模收集它们。所以我，嗯，问，呃，工头发生了什么事，他说，“嗯，你知道，嗯，松子在意大利的食品工业中非常受欢迎并且很有价值。” +

莉兹：为了食物（是的）。不是燃料！我以为你会说他们要把它们放在火上（烧掉）。是的。 +

Shelagh：嗯，当他们用完圆锥体后，他们可能会烧掉，呃，圆锥体，但这些圆锥体里面有一些白色的小东西，比如坚果，呃，我意识到它们在意大利烹饪中经常使用，呃，我想有一种来自热那亚的特殊酱汁，可以搭配意大利面条，叫做“香蒜酱”，其中将这些坚果磨碎，当然它们也可以用于蛋糕和糖果之类的东西中。 +

莉兹：所以这是一道美味佳肴。 +

Shelagh：这真是一道美味。当然，我从来没有想过他们是如何得到它们的，因为你无法想象有一个松子农场。所以他所说的情况是，像他这样的私营公司从意大利政府那里购买了许可证，有权进入庞贝古城等地方——考古遗址之类的地方——并系统地收集从树上掉下来的所有松果，同样，在森林里。 +

丽兹：当然，他们必须爬上树，因为当树掉下来时，食物就不再好吃了。 +

谢拉：没错。他们正在把它们拉下来，他说他们非常擅长，嗯，识别哪些已经准备好，哪些有点硬等等。每个人都有一根末端有钩子的棍子，它们是人们常常把松树从树上拉下来，但显然，坐等松树倒下是不够的。你，你必须为此做点什么。他们就在那里。就这样，呃，我对废墟看了大约半个小时的时间就结束了。我对这种呃农业的奇怪形式太着迷了。 +

莉兹：嗯，你不打算看到的总是最有趣的。 +

Shelagh：更有趣。 +
