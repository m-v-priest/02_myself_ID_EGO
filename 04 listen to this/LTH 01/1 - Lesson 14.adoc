==== B. Shopping.

Shopkeeper: Yes, Mrs. Davies? What could we do for you today? +
Mrs. Davies: I want to order some foods. +
Shopkeeper: Well, I thought that might be the reason you came here, Mrs. Davies. Ha, ha, +
ha, ha, ha. +
Mrs. Davies: But I want rather a lot, so you'll have to deliver it. +
Shopkeeper: That's perfectly all right. You just order whatever you like and we'll send it +
straight round to your house this afternoon. +
Mrs. Davies: Right. Well, first of all I want two boxes of baked beans. +
Shopkeeper: You mean two tins? +
Mrs. Davies: No, I mean two boxes. Two boxes of tins of baked beans. +
Shopkeeper: But each box contains forty-eight tins. Are you really sure you want so many? +
I mean, it would take a long time to eat so many. +
Mrs. Davies: Who said anything about eating them? I'm saving them. +
Shopkeeper: Saving them? +
Mrs. Davies: Yes, for the war. +
Shopkeeper: War? Are we going to have a war? +
Mrs. Davies: You never know. I'm not taking any chances. I read the papers. You're not +
going to catch me stuck in the house without a thing to eat. So put down two boxes of +
baked beans, will you? And three boxes of rice, five boxes of spaghetti and you'd better +
send me a hundred tins of tomato sauce to go with it. Have you got that? +
Shopkeeper: Yes, two boxes of baked beans, three boxes of rice, five boxes of spaghetti +
and a hundred tins of tomato sauce. But I'm not sure we have all these things in stock. I +
mean not that amount. +
Mrs. Davies: How soon can you get them, then? +
Shopkeeper: Well, within the next few days. I don't suppose you'll be needing them before +
then, will you? +
Mrs. Davies: You never can tell. It's touch and go. I was watching the nice man on the +
television last night. You know, the one with the nice teeth. Lovely smile he's got. And he +
said, 'Well, you never can tell. And that set me thinking, you see. Anyway, you just deliver +
them as soon as you can. I shan't be going out again after today. Now ... now what else? +
Ah yes, tea and sugar. I'd better have a couple of boxes of each of those. No ... no make if +
four of sugar. I've got a sweet tooth. +
Shopkeeper: So two boxes of tea and four boxes of sugar. Anything else? It doesn't sound +
a very interesting diet. How about half a dozen boxes of tinned fish? +
Mrs. Davies: Fish? No, I can't stand fish. Oh, but that reminds me, eight boxes of cat food. +
Shopkeeper: Cat food? +
Mrs. Davies: Yes. Not for me. You don't think I'm going to sit there on my own, do you? +

==== Dictation.

Spot Dictation 1: +

A sailor once went into a pub in a very dark street in Liverpool. He got very drunk +
there and staggered out around 11 pm. Around midnight, one of his friends found him on +
his hands and knees in the gutter. "What are you doing there?" he inquired. "I'm looking +
for my wallet. I think I lost it in that dark street down there," he said. "Well, if you lost it in +
that street, why are you looking for it here?" the friend demanded. The sailor thought for a +
moment." Because the light is better here," he answered. +

Spot Dictation 2: +

A famous 85-year-old millionaire once gave a lecture at an American university. "I'm +
going to tell you how to live a long, healthy life and how to get very rich at the same time," +
he announced. "The secret is very simple. All you have to do is avoid bad habits like +
drinking and smoking. But you have to get up early every morning, work at least 10 hours +
a day and save every penny, as well," he said. A young man in the audience stood up. +
"My father did all those things and yet he died a very poor man at the age of only 39. How +
do you explain that?" he asked. The millionaire thought for a moment. "It's very simple. He +
didn't do them for long enough," he answered.
