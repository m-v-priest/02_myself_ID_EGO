==== A. Interview.

(Elina Malinen was in fact invited for an interview at the "Bon Appetit Restaurant". Here is
part of the interview.) +
Johnson: Good evening, Miss Malinen. Won't you sit down? +
Elina: Good evening. Thank you. +
Johnson: Now, I notice you left the Hotel Scandinavia in l980. What are you now doing in
England? +
Elina: I'm spending a few months brushing up my English and getting to know the country
better. +
Johnson: And you want to work in England too. Why? +
Elina: I'm keen on getting some experience abroad, and I like England and English
people. +
Johnson: Good. Now, I see from the information you sent me that you've worked in your
last employment for nearly four years. Was that a large restaurant? +
Elina: Medium-size for Finland, about forty tables. +
Johnson: I see. Well, you'd find it rather different here. Ours is much smaller, we have only
ten tables. +
Elina: That must be very cosy. +
Johnson: We try to create a warm, intimate atmosphere. Now, as to the job, you would be
expected to look after five tables normally, though we get in extra staff for peak periods. +
Elina: I see. +
Johnson: I'm the Restaurant Manager and Head Waiter, so you'd be working directly
under me. You'd be responsible for bringing in the dishes from the kitchen, serving the
drinks, and if necessary looking after the bills. So you'd be kept pretty busy. +
Elina: I'm used to that. In my last position we were busy most of the time, especially in
summer. +
Johnson: Good. Now, is there anything you'd like to ask about the job? +
Elina: Well, the usual question—what sort of salary were you thinking of paying? +
Johnson: We pay our waiters forty pounds a week, and you would get your evening meal
free. +
Elina: I see. +
Johnson: Now, you may have wondered why I asked you here so late in the day. The fact
is, I would like to see you in action, so to speak. Would you be willing to act as a waitress
here this evening for half-an-hour or so? Our first customer will be coming in, let me see,
in about ten minutes' time. +
Elina: Well, I'm free this evening otherwise. +
Johnson: Good. And in return perhaps you will have dinner with us? Now, let me show
you the kitchen first. This way, please ...

==== B. Discussion.

（sound of kettle whistling） +
Tom: Well, what's the forecast? Are we going to have more snow? And ... is your mother
awake? +
Helen: Hang on, Dad. The first answer is 'yes' and the second is 'no'. Let's have a cup of
tea. +
Tom: That's a good idea. ... Where's Jean? Where's your mother? Jean, how about some
breakfast? +
Helen: Shh. Mother's still asleep, as I've told you. +
Tom: And what about the twins? Where are Peter and Paul? +
Helen: They were sick all night. That's why Mum is so tired today. And ... they're having a
birthday party tomorrow. Remember? +
Tom: Another birthday? Helen, look at the clock. It's 8:45. Let's go. We're going to be late.

==== C. Past Mistakes. +

—Me, officer? You're joking! +
—Come off it, Mulligan. For a start, you spent three days watching the house. You
shouldn't have done that, you know. The neighbors got suspicious and phoned the
police ... +
—But I was only looking, officer. +
—... and on the day of the robbery, you really shouldn't have used your own car. We got
your number. And if you'd worn a mask, you wouldn't have been recognized. +
—I didn't go inside! +
—Ah, there's another thing. You should've worn gloves, Mulligan. If you had, you wouldn't
have left your fingerprints all over the house. We found your fingerprints on the jewels,
too. +
—You mean ... you've found the jewels? +
—Oh yes. Where you ... er ... 'hid' them. Under your mattress. +
—My God! You know everything! I'll tell you something, officer—you shouldn't have joined
the police force. If you'd taken up burglary, you'd have made a fortune!

==== D. Monologue.

Why do people play football? It's a stupid game, and dangerous too. Twenty-two men
fight for two hours to kick a ball into a net. They get more black eyes than goals. On dry,
hard pitches they break their bones. On muddy ones they sprain their muscles.
Footballers must be mad. And why do people watch football? They must be mad too.
They certainly shout and scream like madmen. In fact I'm afraid to go out when there's a
football match. The crowds are so dangerous. I'd rather stay at home and watch TV. But
what happens when I switch on? They're showing a football match. So I turn on the radio.
What do I hear? 'The latest football scores.' And what do I see when I open a newspaper?
Photos of footballers, interviews with footballers, reports of football matches. Footballers
are the heroes of the twentieth century. They're rich and famous. Why? Because they can
kick a ball around. How stupid! Everyone seems to be mad about football, but I'm not.
Down with football, I say.

== Section 3

==== Dictation.
(sound of knocking at door)
Mrs. Brink: Come in. Oh, it's you again, Tom. What have you done this time? +
Tom: I've cut my finger and it's bleeding a lot.
Mrs. Brink: Let me see, Tom ... Hmmm, that is a bad cut. I can clean it and put a plaster on
it, but you'll have to see the doctor.
