==== Dictation. A Letter.

47 Riverside Road, London SE1 4LP. +
10th May, 1989 +

Dear Chris, +
Thanks for your letter. I'm sorry I haven't answered it sooner but writing is difficult at
the moment. I fell off my bike last week and broke my arm. It isn't anything very serious
and I'll be OK in a few weeks.

Your holiday sounds fantastic. I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Someone at work went to Jamaica last year and had a wonderful time. When are you going exactly? I hope you'll have good weather.

There isn't really much more news from here. I'll write a longer letter in a few weeks.
Send me a postcard and give my regards to everyone.

Yours +
Kim
