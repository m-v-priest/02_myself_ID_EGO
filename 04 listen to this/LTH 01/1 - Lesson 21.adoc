== Section 2

==== A. Intentions.

1st Student: Well, first of all, I'm intending to have a good holiday abroad, just traveling
round Europe, and then when I get *tired(a.) of* traveling I'm going to —well, come back and
start looking for a job. I haven't quite decided yet what job, but I'm probably going to try
and get a job in advertising of some kind.

enough money to do that at the moment, of course, so I've decided to get a temporary job
for a year *or so*, and I'm going to work really hard and try and save *as much* money *as possible*. Actually, I'm thinking of working as a waiter, or some job in a restaurant anyway ...

Discussion 1:  +

Jerry: Could I speak to you for a few minutes, Mr. Sherwin?  +
Sherwin: I'm very busy at the moment. Can't it wait until tomorrow?  +
Jerry: Uh, ... well, it's rather urgent. And it won't take long.  +
Sherwin: Oh, all right, then. What is it?  +
Jerry: It's a personal matter. Uh, you see, my wife is ill and has to go into hospital.  +
Sherwin: Sorry to hear that. But why do you want to talk to me about it?  +
Jerry: Because ... because we have a baby and there's nobody to look after her while
she's in hospital.  +
Sherwin: Who? Your wife?  +
Jerry: No, no. My daughter.  +

Sherwin: Oh, I see. But I still don't understand what all this has to do with me.  +
Jerry: But that's what I'm trying to explain. I'd like to stay at home for a few days.  +
Sherwin: But why?  +
Jerry: To look after my daughter, of course.  +
Sherwin: I thought you said she was going to hospital. They'll look after her there, won't
they?  +
Jerry: No, no, no! It's my wife who's going to hospital! Not my daughter.  +

Discussion 2:

Here is an alternative dialogue between Jerry and Mr. Sherwin. Listen.  +
Jerry: Uh ... excuse me, Mr. Sherwin, but I was wondering if I could speak to you for a few minutes.  +
Sherwin: Well, I'm rather busy at the moment, Jerry. Is it urgent?  +
Jerry: Uh, yes, I ... I'm afraid it is. It's a personal matter.  +
Sherwin: Oh, well, then, we'd better discuss it now. Sit down.  +
Jerry: Thank you. Uh ... you see, it's about my wife. She ... uh ... well ... she ...  +
Sherwin: Yes, go on, Jerry. I'm listening.  +

Jerry: She's ill and has to go to hospital tomorrow. But we have a young baby, you know.  +
Sherwin: Yes, I know that, Jerry. You must be rather worried. Is it anything serious? Your
wife's illness, I mean?  +
Jerry: The doctors say it's just a minor operation. But it has to be done as soon as possible.
And ... well ... the problem is my daughter. The baby. That's the problem.  +


Sherwin: In what way, Jerry? I'm not quite sure if I understand.  +
Jerry: Well, as I said, my wife'll be in hospital for several days, so there's nobody to look after her.  +
Sherwin: You mean, nobody to look after your daughter, is that it?  +
Jerry: Yes, exactly. Both our parents live rather far away, and ...and that's why I'd like to have a few days off. From tomorrow.  +

-> A solution is still some way off. 解决办法尚需时日。 +
-> Sarah's off in India somewhere. 萨拉远在印度某地。
====

Sherwin: I see. I think I understand now. You need a few days off to look after your
daughter while your wife is in hospital.  +
Jerry: Yes, yes. That's it. I'm not explaining this very well.  +
Sherwin: No, no. On the contrary. I just want to be sure I understand completely. That's
all.  +


Jerry: Will ... will that be all right?  +
Sherwin: Yes, I'm sure it will, Jerry. All I want to do now is make sure that there's someone to *cover for* you while you're away. Uh ... how long did you say you'll need?  +
Jerry: Just a few days. She ... my wife, I mean ... should be out of hospital by next
Thursday, so I can be back on Friday.  +
Sherwin: Well, perhaps you'd better stay at home on Friday, as well. Just to give your wife a few extra days to rest after the operation.  +
Jerry: That's very kind of you, Mr. Sherwin.  +
Sherwin: Don't mention it.

Student: I see. And is the room fairly quiet?  +

so it's bright and sunny, too. It's very attractive, really. And it's just under the roof, so it's

==== E. Monologue.



Frankly, I've been delighted(a.). As you know, I decided to give it up ten years ago. I put
them all in the attic —all fifty or sixty of them —to gather(v.) dust, and forgot about them.

Then I just happened to meet him one day in a bar, entirely(adv.) by chance, and we *got talking about* this and that, and, well —to cut a long story short —he went to have a look at them, and this
is the result. It's for two weeks. And it's devoted entirely to my work. Doing very well, too, as you can see from the little tickets on about half of them.

- to cut a long story short 长话短说
====


You know, *now that* they're hanging on the wall like this, with all the clever lighting, and glossy(a.) catalogue, and the smart people, they really don't seem anything to do with me. It's a bit like seeing old friends in new circumstances where they fit and you don't.

====

-> a clever little gadget 精巧的小器具 +

Now, you see her? She's already bought three. Heard her saying one day she's 'dying to meet the man'. Afraid she'd be very disappointed if she did. Interesting, though, some of the things you overhear. +
Some know something about it. Others know nothing and admit it. Others know nothing
and don't. By the way, I heard someone say the other day that the 'Portrait of a Woman'
reminded her of you, you know. So you see, you're not only very famous, but —as I keep
on telling you —you haven't changed a bit.

====

== Section 3

==== Dictation.

Ours is a very expensive perfume. When people see it or hear the name we want them to think of luxury. There are many ways to do this. You show a woman in a fur coat, in a silk evening dress, maybe covered in diamonds. You can show an expensive car, an expensive restaurant, or a man in a tuxedo.  +
We decided to do something different. We show a beautiful woman, simply but elegantly dressed, beside a series of paintings(n.) by Leonardo da Vinci, and it works. Because she is wearing the perfume, and because she is next to expensive and beautiful paintings, our perfume must be beautiful and expensive too. It does work.

====

- silk 丝织物；丝绸
- tuxedo :  /tʌkˈsiːdoʊ/  A tuxedo is a suit, usually black, that is worn by men for formal social events. 男式礼服 /男式无尾礼服上装 +
image:../img/tuxedo.jpg[]

- wear perfume 喷香水

- 我们决定做些不同的事情。我们在列奥纳多·达·芬奇(Leonardo da Vinci)的一系列画作旁展示了一位穿着简单而优雅的美丽女子，效果不错。因为她身上喷着香水，因为她旁边是昂贵而美丽的画作，所以我们的香水也一定是美丽而昂贵的。这种做法是生效的。
