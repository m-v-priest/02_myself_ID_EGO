==== E. Monologue 2.


I was born in Scotland. In Glasgow *to be exact*. In the early 1950s and I suppose like everybody else, I went to school. Primary school, then secondary school. The only difference really is that I always went to the same school from when I was aged five, right through until I was aged eighteen. So there wasn’t really much to relate(v.) about that part of my life. I suppose it was much the same as everybody else’s.


- Glasgow 城市名

-> He related the facts of the case to journalists. 他给记者们讲述了这件事的实际情况。


I lived in my hometown, Paisley, all that time. But then aged eighteen, like most British people of my sort of class *and so on*, I left my hometown and moved away to university. A lot of British people don’t go to their local university —they go to another one which is further away. Possibly because they’d rather not stay at home with their parents. So I left my hometown of Paisley and I went to St. Andrews on the east coast of Scotland. There I studied English and then Modern History, and so for four years I studied those subjects and was very happy.


-  and so on 等等；诸如此类
- St. Andrews 英国港市



Later I left St. Andrews with a degree in Modern History, and not really knowing what I wanted to do. I wasn’t sure whether I’d go on to do some research or whether I’d like to be a teacher. So I took a year off to think about it.  +
And then one year later I decided I wanted to be a teacher and I went to Teacher Training College.  +
And this time yet again it was in another part of the country. In Newcastle in the northeast of England, so there I trained to be a teacher and I qualified as a teacher of History and English. And after that year I began work —real work for the first time in my 1ife. I suppose this would be around 1977.

- degree （大学）学位
- take sth off 休假；休息 /取消；停演 / 脱下（衣服）；摘掉 +
-> I've decided to take a few days off next week. 我已决定下星期休息几天。



So then I went to work in a comprehensive school in southeast England outside London in a place called Basildon. And there I taught History, but I found out I really disliked both the place, Basildon, and the school. It was a terrible school.  +
So I thought I don’t want to be stuck here the rest of my life. I want to try something different. So I did something completely different.

-> public school 公学. 已演变成精英教育的贵族学校. +
-> 国际学校: 为非欧盟国家学生服务的学校.



I went to er ...  would you believe, the Sudan. And I ended up in Omdurman which is near the capital city of Khartoum in Sudan. And I taught English, I taught English to foreigners —to, in fact, teachers of English in a Teacher Training College. That went on for a couple of years.  +
And then I returned to Britain where I did my Master’s degree in Applied Linguistics. This time, again, in another part of the country. In Wales, in North Wales, at a place called Bangor. +
After graduating, and getting my master’s, I went and I taught at Lancaster University. I taught Algerian students who were going to come to British universities to study.

- Algerian 阿尔及利亚的, 阿尔及利亚人


Then I went, for quite a long time, to Yugoslavia, to Lubijiana to be exact. And I taught ESP. ESP means English for Special Purposes —in particular I taught Scientific English in a Chemistry Department connected to UNESCO, U-N-E-S-C-O.  +
And so I worked there for five years and then I moved, but still in the same city. I moved to another job, in medical English, in a hospital —which was also connected with UNESCO.  +
After a total of seven years in Yugoslavia, and I left and I ended up here where I am now in China, teaching at Yiwai.
