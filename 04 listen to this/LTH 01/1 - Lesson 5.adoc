1. Listen to the recording and fill in the missing words.

Instructor: Listen to these people. They are all taking things to be repaired. Of course, they want to know how much it will cost and how long it will take. Listen to their questions and write the answers you hear. Here is an example.

Woman: How much will it cost to repair this typewriter? +
Male Assistant: About a pound. +
Woman: That's not bad. But how long will it take? +
Male Assistant: Only about a week.


Instructor: Look at the answers the assistant gives his customer. The first answer is 'about
a pound.' The second answer is 'about a week.' Now listen to these dialogues and write
the missing words in your book.

Man: That's rather a lot. And how long will it take? +
Female Assistant: About a month. +
Man: Thank you. I'd like to think about it. +

Instructor: Listen again to the customer from the typewriter shop. He thinks twenty pounds is rather a lot but he needs a typewriter... Then he remembers his friend, Tony. Tony has several typewriters. Bob, the customer, has an idea. He meets his friends, Tony. Listen to their conversation.

wanted to be a success. Now I'm the manager.

Dictation 2:

On my first day in London I felt hungry, so I went into a restaurant and sat down at a table. I waited for ten minutes, but nobody came to serve me. Then I saw that there were no waiters. The customers stood in a queue and got their food themselves. That was my first experience of a self-service restaurant.
