==== A. Description.

This table shows the number of commuters into central London between 7:00 am and
10:00 am daily. The total number is 1,023,000. Of these, 405,000 travel by
underground—that's 29% of the total, and 28% travel by British Rail—that's 391,000
people daily. 10% use both rail and underground, and 10%, 99,000 people, travel by bus.
That means a total of 788,000 people, 77%, on public transport. The remainder use
private transport. 197,000 come by car and the rest come either by motorbike or bicycle.
This means 4% come by motorbike or bicycle, and 19% by car.

Mrs. Nicholas: The name's Nicholas, and the address is 14 Spring Vale. +

won't you? +
