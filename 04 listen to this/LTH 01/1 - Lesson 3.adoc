Interview: Too Old at Twenty

Do you remember Sally Green, the swimming star? She was the girl who broke all the records at the last Olympics. Where is she now? Last week our reporter, Tom Parker, went to see Sally in her Californian home.

Tom: Is it true that you don't swim at all now? +
Sally: I'm afraid so. I'm too old. +
Tom: But you are only twenty! +
Sally: That's too old for a swimmer. If I swam in an international competition now, I wouldn't win. So I'd rather not swim at all. +
Tom: But don't you enjoy swimming? +
Sally: I used to, when I was small. But if you enter for big competitions you have to work very hard. I used to get up at 6 am to go to the pool. I had to train before school, after school and at weekends. I swam thirty-five miles every week! +
Tom: But you were famous at fifteen. And look at all those cups. +
Sally: Would you like to polish them? It's true that I have some wonderful memories. I enjoyed visiting other countries, and the Olympics were very exciting. But I missed more important things. While other girls were growing up, I was swimming. What can I do now?

==== Section 3

Dictation.

Dictation 1:

There is a small shop at the end of our road. I buy my newspaper there every Sunday. This is the only shop that is open on a Sunday, so it is always very busy. They
sell milk, eggs, biscuits, tea and coffee. You can get aspirins, toothpaste or a writing pad there. It is a nice little shop.

Dictation 2:

This evening I am going to the cinema. I sometimes go with Beatriz, but this evening I am going alone. Beatriz is nice, but she talks a lot and when I go to the cinema I like to watch the film. The film I am going to is an old one, but it is very good. It is a Hitchcock film.
