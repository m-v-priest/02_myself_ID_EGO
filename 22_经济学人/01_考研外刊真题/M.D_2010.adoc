== 2010-1

主 Of all the changes that *have taken place*(`=to happen, especially after previously being arranged or planned`) in English-language newspapers during the past quarter-century, perhaps the most far-reaching(`=likely to have a lot of influence or many effects`) 谓 *has been* the inexorable(`=that cannot be stopped or changed`) decline in the scope(`=the range of things that a subject, an organization, an activity, etc. deals with`) and seriousness of their arts coverage(n.)新闻报道；采访.
====
- inexorable : ADJ You use inexorable to describe *a process that cannot be prevented from continuing or progressing*. 不可阻挡的 +
=> in-,不，非，ex-,向外，-or,说，词源同orator,oracle.即说不动的，不能变更的，不可阻挡的。 +
-> *the inexorable rise* of crime 阻遏不了的犯罪趋势

- scope : N-SING The scope of an activity, topic, or piece of work is *the whole area which it deals with or includes*. (题目、组织、活动等的)范围 +
-> This subject *lies beyond the scope of our investigation*. 这一问题超出了我们的考察范围。 +
-> Our powers *are limited in scope* . 我们的权限不大。
====

在过去的25年英语报纸所发生的变化中，影响最深远的可能就是它们对艺术方面的报道, 在范围上毫无疑问的缩小了，而且这些报道的严肃程度也绝对降低了。

It is difficult *to the point 达到...的程度 of* impossibility for the average(`=ordinary; not special`) reader (under the age of forty) *to imagine* a time when high-quality arts criticism *could be found* in most big-city newspapers.  

Yet 主 a considerable(`=great in amount, size, importance, etc`) number of the most significant(`=large or important enough to have an effect or to be noticed`) collections of criticism 评论 (*published* in the 20th century) 谓 *consisted in*(`=to have sth as the main or only part or feature`) large part of newspaper reviews (对书、电影等的)评论文章;书评;影评. 

*To read* such books today *is* 表 *to marvel(v.) at*(`=to be very surprised or impressed by sth`)  the fact 同位 that their *learned* contents 谓 *were once deemed*(`=to have a particular opinion about sth`) suitable for publication in general-circulation dailies 日报).
====
- significant => sign,标记，记号，-fic,做，使，词源同 fact,efficient.引申比喻词义重要的，有意义的等。
- *CONSIST IN STH* : ( formal ) to have sth as the main or only part or feature 存在于；在于 +
=> con-共同 + -sist-站立 → 站在一起,并存 +
-> True education *does not consist in* simply being taught facts. 真正的教育并不在于简单地讲授事实。

- *marvel (v.)~ (at sth)* : to be very surprised or impressed by sth 感到惊奇；大为赞叹 +
=> 来自古法语marveille,惊讶，惊奇，奇迹，来自拉丁语mirari,感到惊讶和惊奇，词源同mirror,miracle,smile. + 
-> Everyone *marvelled at* his courage. 人人对他的勇气都惊叹不已。
====

对于年龄低于40岁的普通读者来讲，让他们想象一下当年可以在许多大城市报纸上读到精品的文艺评论，简直几乎是天方夜谭。然而，在20世纪出版的最重要的文艺评论集中，人们读到的大部分评论文章都是从报纸上收集而来。现在，如果读到这些集子，人们肯定会惊诧，当年这般渊博深奥的内容，竟然被认为适合发表在大众日报中。

We *are even farther removed from* the unfocused(`=not looking at a particular thing or person; not having been focused`) newspaper reviews *published* in England between the turn 世纪之交/新年伊始 of the 20th century and the eve(`=the day or evening before an event`) of World War II, at a time when ① newsprint(`=the cheap paper that newspapers are printed on`) 谓 *was* dirt-cheap(`=very cheap`) /and ② stylish(`=fashionable; elegant and attractive`) arts criticism 谓 *was considered* an ornament 装饰物 to the publications in which it *appeared*. 

我们离那些20世纪之初和二战前夕之间, 在英国发表的散漫性（unfocused）报纸评论甚至更远了，在那个时代（at a time ），新闻纸非常廉价，时髦的艺术评论, 被认为是给登载这种内容的出版物提供的一种装饰（ornament）。 

In those far-off(`=a long time ago`) days, it *was taken for granted that*(`=to believe sth is true without first making sure that it is`) the critics of major papers *would write* in detail and at length(`=for a long time and in detail`) about the events they covered(v.)采访，报导.  +
Theirs was a serious business, and even those reviewers who *wore*(`=exhibit, show`) their learning [lightly], like George Bernard Shaw and Ernest Newman, could *be trusted to know* what they were about. 

====
- *take it for granted (that...)* : to believe sth is true *without first making sure that it is* 认为…是理所当然 +
-> I just *took it for granted that* he'd always be around. 我还想当然地以为他总能随叫随到呢。

- *take sb/sth for granted* : to be so used to sb/sth that *you do not recognize their true value any more* and *do not show that you are grateful* （因习以为常）对…不予重视；（因视为当然而）不把…当回事 +
-> We *take* having an endless supply of clean water *for granted*. 我们想当然地认为洁净水的供应无穷无尽而不予以珍惜

- *AT LENGTH / AT... LENGTH* : for a long time and in detail 长时间；详尽地 +
-> We have already discussed this matter *at great length*. 我们已经十分详尽地讨论了这个问题。

- who *wore* their learning [lightly]：在此意为“以轻松活泼的方式展现的自己的学识”。*wear意同exhibit, show，与learning搭配，意思即把学识像穿衣服一样，展示在众人面前*，而这种展示方式又是lightly (轻松地，愉快地)，有种举重若轻的意味。整句意思是说，这些学识深广的评论家虽然所撰述的文章风格轻松活泼，但他们深知自己所从事的是严肃的工作，视其为一种使命。 +
在韦氏词典中对wear的解释为exhibit, present，所给的例句为commend the book for *wearing its research so lightly* (因其内容深入浅出而推荐这本书)，lightly在这里表示“轻松地，容易理解地”，根据具体内容翻译为“深入浅出”。
====

在那些遥远的年代，各大报刊的评论家们都会不遗余力地详尽报道他们所报道的事情，这在当时被视为是理所当然的事情。他们的写作是件严肃的事情，人们相信：甚至那些博学低调不喜欢炫耀的评论家，比如George Bernard Shaw和Ernest Newman也知道自己在做什么(即他们的文章会高调出现在报纸上)。

These men *believed in* journalism 新闻业 *as* a calling(`=a profession or career`), and *were* proud *to be published* in the daily press(`=newspapers and magazines`).  

“So(这里是so...that... 如此...以致) few authors *have* brains(`=the ability to learn quickly and think about things in a logical and intelligent way`) enough or literary gift(`=a natural ability`)天赋 enough *to keep* their own *end up* 尽自己的本分;坚持做好自己的本职工作 in journalism,” Newman *wrote*, “that(呼应前面的so, 变成so...that...) I *am tempted* to define ‘journalism’ as ‘a term 术语 of contempt(`=the feeling that sb/sth is without value and deserves no respect at all`) *applied by* writers (who are not read(a.)(`=having knowledge that has been gained from reading books, etc`)) *to* writers (who are).’”
====
- “*So* few authors have brains [enough] or literary gift [enough] to keep their own end up in journalism,” Newman wrote, “*that* I am tempted to define ‘journalism’ as ‘a term of contempt (applied by writers who are not read to writers who are’)”. <- 整个句子其实是一个 so...that... 句法.

- 在 a term of contempt applied by writers (who are not read to writers who are) 中，who引导的定语从句, 修饰的是前面的名词 writers. 

- If you have to *keep your end up*, or to *keep up your end of something*, you have to do something as well as other people, or as well as you are expected to do it. 坚持下去；尽自己的本分;做好自己的本职工作 +
- *keep your end up* : ( BrE informal ) to continue to be cheerful in a difficult situation （在困难面前）不泄气，保持乐观
====

这些批评家们相信报刊评论是一项职业，并且对于他们的文章能够在报纸上发表感到很自豪。“鉴于几乎没有作家能拥有足够的智慧或文学天赋,以保证他们在新闻报纸写作中站稳脚跟”， Newman曾写道，“我倾向于把新闻写作定义为"不受读者欢迎的作家用来嘲讽受读者欢迎的作家"的一个轻蔑之词 ”

Unfortunately, these critics *are virtually(`=almost or very nearly`) forgotten*.  +
主 Neville Cardus, who *wrote for* the Manchester Guardian(`=a person who protects sth`) *from* 1917 *until* shortly before 前不久；在...之前不久 his death in 1975, 谓 *is [now] known solely(`=only; not involving sb/sth else`) as* a writer of essays(`=a short piece of writing on a particular subject`) on the game of cricket 板球. 

During his lifetime, though 尽管;虽然, he *was* also one of England’s foremost(`=the most important or famous; in a position at the front`) classical-music critics, a stylist(`=a writer who takes great care to write or say sth in an elegant or unusual way`) *so* widely admired *that*(如此...以致...) his Autobiography 自传 (1947) *became* a best-seller. 

He *was knighted* 骑士,爵士 in 1967, the first music critic *to be* so honored. Yet only one of his books *is* now in print, and his vast body(`=a large amount or collection of sth`) of writings on music *is* unknown save(`=except sth`) to specialists(`=a person who is an expert in a particular area of work or study`).
====
- save (prep): ( also *save for* ) ( old use ) ( formal ) *except sth* 除了；除…外 +
-> They knew nothing about her *save her name*. 除名字外，他们对她一无所知。
====

不幸的是，这些批评家们现在实际上已被人们遗忘。从1917年开始一直到1975年去世不久前还在为曼彻斯特《卫报》写文章的Neville Cardus，如今仅仅作为一个撰写关于板球比赛文章的作家被人们所知。但是，在他的一生当中，他也是英国首屈一指的古典音乐评论家之一。他也是一位深受读者青睐的文体家，所以1947年他的《自传》一书就成为热销读物。 

1967年他被授予爵士称号，也是第一位获此殊荣的音乐评论家。然而，他的书现在只有一本可以在市面上买到。他大量的音乐批评，除了专门研究音乐评论的人以外，已鲜为人知。

Is there any chance that Cardus’s criticism(`=the act of expressing disapproval of sb/sth and opinions about their faults or bad qualities; a statement showing disapproval`) *will enjoy*(`=to have sth good that is an advantage to you`) a revival(`=becoming or being made popular or fashionable again`)? The prospect(`=the chances of being successful`) *seems* remote(`=far away`). 

Journalistic tastes(`=what a person likes or prefers`) *had changed* [long before his death], and postmodern 后现代派的 readers *have* little use(n.)用途 for the richly(`=has a lot of elaborate and beautiful decoration, patterns, or furniture`) upholstered(`=have a soft covering that makes them comfortable to sit on`) Vicwardian prose(`=writing that is not poetry`)散文 in which he *specialized* 专门研究（或从事）；专攻.  +
Moreover, the amateur tradition in music criticism *has been* 表 in headlong(`=with the head first and the rest of the body following`) retreat(`=a movement away from a place or an enemy because of danger or defeat`).
====
- upholster : 来自 uphold,支持，维护，-ster,人。引申词义布置，维修，为椅子装软垫等。 upkeep 保养，维修
- Vicwardian：Victorian &Edwardian的缩写，维多利亚时代和爱德华七世时代的.
- Vicwardian : 维多-华德时期的（Victorian&Edwardian，维多利亚女王及爱德华七世时期）
- headlong : *without thinking carefully* before doing sth 轻率地 +
-> The government is taking care *not to rush headlong into* another controversy. 政府现在很谨慎，以防不慎陷入另一场争端。

- Is there any chance {that Cardus's criticism  *will enjoy* a revival}? ② The prospect *seems* remote. ③ Journalistic tastes  *had changed* [long before his death], and postmodern readers *have little use for* the richly uphostered Vicwardian prose (in which *he specialized*). ④ Moreover, the amateur tradition in music criticism *has been* in headlong retreat.  
====
Cardus的评论有没有机会重新流行？前景似乎渺茫。在他去世之前，新闻业的品味早已改变很长时间了，而且他所擅长的措词华丽的维多利亚爱德华时期的散文风格，对后现代的读者没有什么用处。何况，由业余爱好者作音乐批评的传统, 早已经成为昨日黄花了。

Over the past decade, thousands of patents 专利权 *have been granted*(`=to agree to give sb what they ask for, especially formal or legal permission to do sth`) for what *are called* business methods. ② Amazon.com *received* one *for* its "one-click" online payment system. ③ Merrill Lynch *got* legal protection for an asset(`=a thing of value, especially property, that a person or company owns, which can be used or sold to pay debts`) allocation(`=the act of giving sth to sb for a particular purpose`) strategy. ④ One inventor *patented*(`=to obtain a patent for an invention or a process`) a technique for lifting a box.
====
- *grant (v.)~ sth (to sb/sth) /~ (sb)* : sth to agree to give sb what they ask for, especially formal or legal permission to do sth （尤指正式地或法律上）同意，准予，允许 +
-> The bank finally *granted a ￡500 loan to me*. 银行终于同意给我贷款500英镑。
====

在过去的十年中，成千上万的商业方法被授予了专利权。亚马逊网站获得的专利是在线“单击”付费系统。美林公司的资产分配方案得到了法律保护。有个发明者的提箱技巧也获得了专利。

Now the nation's top patent court *appears completely ready to scale back*(`=to reduce or make a reduction in the level of activity, extent, numbers, etc`) on business-method patents, which *have been* controversial(a.)(`=causing a lot of angry public discussion and disagreement`) ever since they *were first authorized*(`=to give official permission for sth, or for sb to do sth`) 10 years ago. ② [In a move(n.)(`=you formally suggest it so that everyone present can vote on it`) (that *has* intellectual-property 知识产权 lawyers abuzz(a.)(`=noisy like the sound of a bee`))] the U.S. court of Appeals 上诉法院 for the federal circuit(n.)(`=a regular journey made by a judge to hear court cases in each of the courts of law in a particular area`)（法官的）巡回审判 *said* {it *would use* a particular case *to conduct*(`=to organize and/or do a particular activity`) a broad(`=general; not detailed`) review of business-method patents. ③ In re Bilski, as the case is known , *is* "a very big deal", *says* _Dennis D. Crouch_ of the University of Missouri School of law 法学院. It "*has* the potential *to eliminate*(`=to remove or get rid of sth/sb`) an entire class(`=a group of people, animals or things that have similar characteristics or qualities`) of patents."
====
- *scale back* : V to reduce or make a reduction in the level of activity, extent, numbers, etc 缩减(活动、范围、数量等的等级)
- V-T/V-I At a meeting, if you *move for* something or *move that* something should happen, *you formally suggest it so that everyone present can vote on it*. 提议

- as the case is known , 插入语成分，是定语从句修饰Bilski案，“正如该案例为人所知”.
====

现在，该国最高专利法院似乎完全准备好要缩减商业方法专利，因为商业方法专利自从十年前第一次批准授予以来, 一直有争议。在一项使得知识产权律师们议论纷纷的提议中，美国联邦巡回上诉法院声称，它将利用某个具体案件, 来对商业方法专利进行广泛的复审。密苏里大学法学院Dennis D. Crouch说，“正如人们所知道的那样，Bilski案例是一件非常大的事情”它可能将消除整个专利类别”。

{Curbs(`=something that controls and puts limits on sth`) on business-method claims} *would be* a dramatic about-face(n.)(`=a complete change of attitude or opinion`), because it *was* the federal circuit itself that *introduced* such patents *with* its 1998 decision in the so-called state Street Bank case 州银行案, *approving* a patent *on a way of* *pooling*(`=to collect money, information, etc. from different people so that it can be used by all of them`) mutual-fund 共同基金 assets. ② That ruling *produced* an explosion in business-method patent filings(`=cases filed in a court of law`), initially(`=at the beginning`) by emerging internet companies *trying to stake out*(`=to say or show publicly that you think sth should be yours`) exclusive(a.)(`=is used or owned by only one person or group, and not shared with anyone else`) rights *to* specific(`=connected with one particular thing only`) types of online transactions(`=a piece of business that is done between people, especially an act of buying or selling`). ③ Later, `主` more established(a.)(`=respected or given official status because it has existed or been used for a long time`) companies `谓` *raced to add* such patents *to* their files, [if only *as* a defensive move against rivals] that *might beat* them *to the punch*(`=a hard hit made with the fist`). 
====
- filings : N-PLURAL *Court filings* are cases filed(v.)(`=to present sth so that it can be officially recorded and dealt with 提起（诉讼）；提出（申请）；送交（备案）`) in a court of law. (法院的)立案 +
-> *In court filings*, they argued that {the settlement was inadequate}. 他们在法院的立案中提出, 赔偿金数额不够。

- *stake (out) a/your claim (to/for/on sth)* : to say or show publicly that you think sth should be yours 公开宣布自己（对某物）的所有权；向公众表示某物应属于自己 +
-> Adams *staked his claim for a place in the Olympic team* with his easy win yesterday. 亚当斯昨天轻松获胜，这无异于告诉人们奥运代表队中应有他的位置。

- stake: 桩；标桩；篱笆桩
- stake out 意为“立桩标出(地界等)”，“声称对...有特殊关联或所有权”，本句中意为后者。stake out exclusive rights to sth.“声称对...有独有权”。
- *stake sth out* : (1) *to clearly mark the limits of sth that you claim is yours* 清楚地界定自认为属于自己的东西 (有种比喻的用法, 即"*打桩标出你的势力范围*") +
(2) *to state your opinion, position, etc. on sth very clearly* 明确阐述自己的看法（或立场等） +

-> Detectives *had been staking out the house* for several weeks. 侦探们已对这所房子监视了几个星期

- transaction => tran-,转移，进入，act,做，行为。引申词义交易，买卖等。

对于商业方法诉求的限制, 是个戏剧性的彻底变化，因为正是联邦巡回法院自己引进了这种专利。那是在1998年，对于所谓的美国道富银行的案件中，联邦巡回法院做出了判决，批准了筹集共同基金资产的方法具有专利权。这一裁决使得商业方法专利文件以几何数级增加，起初只是一些新兴的网络公司对于某些特定类型的在线交易系统，试图争取独家专有权。后来，更多的公司竞相添加这样的专利权，希望这样一个防御性的行为可以先下手为强。(之后，更多成熟的公司竞相在自己的领域增加这样的专利，如果只作为一种举措来对抗竞争者，那这确实给力他们重重的一拳。)

In 2005, IBM *noted*(`=to mention sth because it is important or interesting`) [in a court filing] that {it *had been issued*(`=to give sth to sb, especially officially`) more than 300 business-method patents *despite 即使；尽管 the fact that* it *questioned*(`=to have or express doubts or suspicions about sth`) the legal basis 法律依据 for *granting*(`=to agree to give sb what they ask for, especially formal or legal permission to do sth`) them}. ② Similarly, some Wall Street investment films *armed*(`=to provide weapons for yourself/sb in order to fight a battle or a war`) themselves *with* patents for financial products, even as 即使 they *took* positions(`=an opinion on or an attitude towards a particular subject`) in court cases 伴随状 *opposing*(`=to disagree strongly with sb's plan, policy, etc. and try to change it or prevent it from succeeding`) the practice.
====
- even as 引导让步状语从句。
- took positions 是“表明立场”的意思。
====

2005年，IBM公司在一份法院报告中声称：尽管怀疑这种专利授权的法律基础，但它已经申请了300多份商业方法专利。(IBM在一份法院文件中指出，尽管授予他们这些专利的法律基础还是需要质疑的，他们还是已经被签发了超过300个的专利了。) 同样，当一些华尔街投资公司出席某些反对其金融产品的法庭案件时，他们会给其各类金融产品申请专利, 来作为自己的维权武器。(一些华尔街投资机构用金融产品的专利把自己武装起来,尽管他们曾在法庭上反对过这些)

The Bilski case *involves* a claimed patent on a method for hedging risk 套期保值风险,套利风险 in the energy market. ② The Federal circuit *issued* an unusual order(`=a legal instruction stating that something must be done (法院)决议`) *stating*(`=to formally write or say sth, especially in a careful and clear way`) that {`主` the case `谓` *would be heard(`=to listen to and judge a case in court`) by* all 12 of the court's judges, *rather than* a typical panel(`=a group of specialists who give their advice or opinion about sth`) of three}, and that {`主` one issue(`=an important topic that people are discussing or arguing about`) it *wants to evaluate*(`=to form an opinion of the amount, value or quality of sth after thinking about it carefully`) `系` *is* `表` whether it *should "reconsider"*(`= to think about sth again, especially because you might want to change a previous decision or opinion`) its state street Bank ruling}.
====
- hedge 树篱
- V-I If you *hedge against* something unpleasant or unwanted that might affect you, especially losing money, *you do something which will protect you from it*. 防备 (尤指金钱损失)
====

前面提到的Bilski案例,牵扯到一份已申请的方法专利，即关于能源市场的风险规避方法(注：也可译为“套期保值或对冲风险”)。上诉法院罕见地裁定，该案件将不由三位法官听审，而是由全部十二名法官共同进行。另外，上诉法院还宣布，它想探讨的另一件事情是:是否应该“重审”道富银行的裁决。

The Federal Circuit's action *comes [in the wake of]*(`=it happens after the other thing is over, often as a result of it`) a series of recent decisions by the supreme Court that *has narrowed*(`=to become or make sth narrower`) the scope(`=the opportunity or ability to do or achieve sth`) of protections for patent holders(`=someone who owns or has something`). ② Last April, for example the justices *signaled*(`=to make a movement or sound to give sb a message, an order, etc`) that too many patents *were being upheld*(`=to support sth that you think is right and make sure that it continues to exist`) for "inventions" that are obvious.  +
The judges on the Federal circuit *are "reacting to* the anti-patent trend(n.) at the Supreme Court", *says* Harold C. Wegner, a patent attorney(`=a lawyer, especially one who can act for sb in court`) and professor at George Washington University Law School.

- wake ：(航行中的船等留下的)伴流，尾流，航迹
- If one thing follows *in the wake of* another, *it happens after the other thing is over, often as a result of it*. 随着…而来;作为…的结果

联邦巡回法院的这一裁决效仿了最高法院。最高法院最近做出了一系列的判决，缩小了专利持有者的受保范围。例如，去年四月，法官们认定,太多的专利授予了一些显而易见的“发明”。乔治华盛顿大学法律学院的专利法律师Harold C. Wegner教授表示，“联邦巡回法院的法官们正在对最高法院的反专利动态做出反应”。

在《引爆流行》这本书中，作者Malcolm Gladwell认为社会流行潮流在很大程度上是由一小部分特殊个体的行为引起的，这些人就是人们常说的影响者。他们异乎寻常的博闻多识，能言善辩，人脉广泛。从直觉上讲，Malcolm Gladwell的理论似乎很有说服力，但是它没有解释流行观念的实际传播过程。

`主` The supposed importance of influentials(a./n.)(`=having a lot of influence on sb/sth`)有影响力的人物 `谓` *derives(`=to come or develop from sth`) from* a plausible(`=seems likely to be true or valid`) sounding 听上去…的 but largely untested theory *called* the "two step flow of communication": Information *flows(`=to move steadily and continuously in one direction`) from* the media *to* the influentials(n.) and *from* them *to* everyone else. ② Marketers *have embraced* the two-step flow because it *suggests* that {if they *can just find* and *influence* the influentials, those selected(a.) people *will do* most of the work *for* them}. 
====
- -sounding：(与形容词连用)表示“有…声音的”，“听上去…的”。 +
-> Many literary academics simply parrot *a set of impressive-sounding(a.) phrases*. 许多文人只是机械地模仿一套听上去令人印象深刻的说法。
====

The theory also *seems* to explain the sudden and unexpected popularity(`=the state of being liked, enjoyed or supported by a large number of people`) of certain looks(`=a fashion; a style`), brands, or neighborhoods. ② In many such cases, a cursory(a.)(`=done quickly and without giving enough attention to details`) search for causes *finds* that some small group of people *was wearing, promoting(`=to help sell a product, service, etc`), or developing* whatever it is [before anyone else *paid attention*]. ③ `主` Anecdotal(a.)(`=is based on individual accounts, rather than on reliable research or statistics, and so may not be valid`) evidence of this kind `谓` *fits nicely with* the idea (that only certain special people *can drive* trends).
====
- look : n. [ sing. ] a fashion; a style 时尚；式样；风格 +
-> *The punk look*(n.) is back in fashion. 鬅客式装扮又时兴起来了。
- cursory => 来自词根cur, 跑，词源同current, course.
- anecdotal : a. based on anecdotes and possibly not true or accurate 逸事的；趣闻的；传闻的 +
=> 前缀an-, 没有。前缀ec-,同ex-, 向外。词根don，给予，见donate, 捐赠，过去分词dot. anecdote的词根 *dot=dit表“给予”，an否定前缀，ec前缀“向外”，即“未向外给出、未公布的事”。*
====

In their recent work, however, some researchers *have come up with*(`= to find or produce an answer, a sum of money, etc`) the finding that influentials *have* far less impact on social epidemics than *is generally supposed*(`=to think or believe that sth is true or possible (based on the knowledge that you have)`). In fact, they *don't seem to be required* of all.

人们之所以认为影响者很重要，是因为受到了“两级传播”理论的影响，即信息先从媒体流向影响者，然后再从影响者流向其他人。这一理论看似合理，但未经验证。营销人员接受两级传播理论是因为该理论认为，如果他们能够找到影响者，并对他们施加影响，这些精英们就会替他们完成大部分的营销传播工作。
这一理论似乎还可以解释某些装扮、品牌或社区为何会突然受到出乎意料的追捧。对于许多诸如此类的情况，如果只是走马观花地寻找原因，你会发现总是有一小群人开风气之先，率先穿上、宣传和开发人们此前从未留意的东西(在其他人注意到这一潮流之前，一些小群体早就开始了引领或发展潮流的做法)。这种事实证据与该观点正好一拍即合——只有一些特别的人才能引领潮流。

但是，在最近的研究中，一些研究人员发现，影响者对社会流行潮流的影响力远比人们认为的要小。事实上，他们似乎根本就是无关紧要。

The researchers' argument(`=a reason or set of reasons that sb uses to show that sth is true or correct`) *stems from* a simple observing(`=to see or notice sb/sth`) about social influence, with the exception of a few celebrities like Oprah Winfrey —— whose outsize(`=larger than the usual size`) presence(`=the quality of making a strong impression on other people by the way you talk or behave`) *is* primarily(ad.)(`=mainly`) a function of media, *not* interpersonal(`=connected with relationships between people`), influence —— even the most influential members of a population *simply don't interact(`=the two things have an effect on each other`) with* that many others. 

研究者的观点源于对社会影响力的简单观察：除了少数像Oprah Winfrey 这样的名人之外(她强大的人气影响力主要来自媒体影响力，而非她与观众互动的人际影响力)，即使人群中最有影响力的人也无法与那么多的“其他人”互动，从而引领潮流。

Yet it is precisely(`=exactly`) these non-celebrity 非名人 influentials who, *according to* the two-step-flow theory, *are supposed* to drive(v.) social epidemics by *influencing* their friends and colleagues directly. ② For a social epidemic *to occur*, however, `主` each person so affected, `谓` *must then influence* his or her own acquaintances(`=a person that you know but who is not a close friend`), who *must* in turn 转而；轮流，依次 *influence* theirs, and so on; and `主` just how many others *pay attention to* each of these people `谓` *has little to do with* 与…几乎无关 the initial influential. 

If `主` people (in the network) (just two degrees *removed(`= belonging to a different generation 隔代的`) from* the initial influential) `系` *prove* resistant(a.)(`=not affected by sth; able to resist sth`), for example, the cascade 瀑布 of change *won't propagate(`=to spread an idea, a belief or a piece of information among many people`) very far* or *affect* many people.
====
- 韦氏词典中对removed的解释：distant in degree of relationship。也就是说指的是关系疏远. + 
 If people in the network just two degrees removed from the initial influential prove resistant 如果那些在社交网中与最初的影响者关系疏远，隔了两层关系（上文有提到）的人，（对它）进行抵制. +
  people的两个定语主要是从功能和句子整体含义来判断的。 从逻辑上看in the network just two degrees removed from the initial influential 都是修饰名词性成分people的，所以是定语。而且从意思上看也是比较合理。如果谓语是removed from，那么prove resistant没法解释其语法成分，逻辑上也讲不通，整个句子意思混乱。
- propagate => 来自拉丁语propagare,延伸，扩展，繁殖，*来自pro-,向前，-pag,固定，词源同page,compact.* 比喻用法，原指使植物新芽繁殖，扩大种植，引申词义宣传，传播。
====

然而，根据两级传播理论，正是这些非名人影响者直接影响了他们的朋友和同事，从而推动了社会流行潮流。但是，要让一种社会流行潮流真正发生，每个受影响的人还必须影响他的熟人，而他的熟人又必须影响其他熟人，依此类推；但是会有多少人去关注这些熟人中的每个人，与最初的影响者几乎没有关系。
举个例子来说，在这个人际影响的网络中，如果第一个影响者受到两次抵制，那么他的连锁影响范围就不会继续扩大，或者说影响的人不会很多。(例如，倘若社会网络中与有影响力人士隔一个层级的那些人（间接受到有影响力人士影响的人）拒绝接受影响，那么，变化的“瀑布”流则无法长久深远的传递，或影响很多人。)

*Building on* the basic truth (about interpersonal(`=connected with relationships between people`) influence), `主` the researchers `谓` *studied* the dynamics of social influence 方式状 by *conducting*(`=to organize and/or do a particular activity`) thousands of computer simulations(n.)(`=a situation in which a particular set of conditions is created artificially in order to study or experience sth that could exist in reality 模拟；仿真`) of populations, *manipulating*(`=to control or influence sb/sth, often in a dishonest way so that they do not realize it`) a number of variables *relating to* people’s ability *to influence* others and their tendency *to be influenced*.
====
- the basic truth about interpersonal influence 这种人际影响的基本事实
====

Our work *shows* that `主` the principal(`=most important; main`) requirement for what we *call* "global cascades" —— the widespread(a.)(`=existing or happening over a large area or among many people`) propagation(`=the spreading of something (a belief or practice) `) of influence *through*(`=by means of`) networks —— `系` *is* the presence *not* of a few influentials *but*, rather （提出不同或相反的观点）相反，反而，而是, of a critical(`=extremely important because a future situation will be affected by it`) mass of easily influenced people, each of whom adopts, say, a look or a brand after being exposed to a single adopting neighbor. Regardless of how influential an individual is locally, he or she can exert global influence only if this critical mass is available to propagate a chain reaction.
====
- presence 有两个介词短语定语, 一个是 of a few influentials, 还有一个是 of a critical mass of easily influenced people
====

基于这一人际影响力的基本事实，研究者们研究了社会影响的动力机制。我们对不同人群进行了成千上万次计算机模拟，不断调整人们影响他人和受他人影响的各种变量。他们发现，人们所说的“全球连锁反应” —— 影响力通过(人际)网络进行广泛传播 —— 发生的主要前提，并不取决于是否存在着那么几个影响者，而主要取决于易受影响的人们是否达到了临界数量。

台面上，银行家们将他们的麻烦归咎于己身，台面下，他们一直把目标对准他人：会计准则制定者。银行业抱怨会计规则迫使他们报告巨大损失，认为这不公平。规则规定，他们必须以第三方付出价格，来评估部分资产的价值，而非按照管理者和监管者期望该资产能够获得的价格。

Unfortunately, banks' lobbying(`=an organized attempt by a group of people to influence politicians on a particular issue`) now *seems to be working*. ② The details *may be* unknowable, but the independence of standard-setters, *essential(a.) to*(`=completely necessary; extremely important in a particular situation or for a particular activity`) the proper(a.)(`=it is considered socially acceptable and right`) functioning(`=working or operating`) of capital markets, *is being compromised*(`=to give up some of your demands after a disagreement with sb, in order to reach an agreement`). ③ And, unless banks *carry*(`=has it for sale`) toxic assets 有毒资产 at prices that *attract* buyers, *reviving* the banking system *will be* difficult.

不幸的是，银行的游说活动看来已显成效。其中细节可能无法获知，但是准则制定者在独立性方面——这正是资产市场正常运行的关键——已经做出妥协了。银行如果不以能够吸引买家的价格计量有毒资产，银行系统的复苏将会非常困难。

After a bruising(a.)(`=people fight or compete with each other in a very aggressive or determined way`) encounter(`=to experience sth, especially sth unpleasant or difficult`) with Congress, America's Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) 财务会计准则委员会 *rushed*(`=to move or to do sth with great speed, often too fast`) through(`=past a barrier, stage or test`) rule changes. ② These *gave* banks more freedom *to use* models *to value* illiquid(a.)(`=(of an asset) not easily convertible into cash`) assets and more flexibility(`=the quality of being adaptable or variable`) in *recognizing* losses on long-term assets in their income statement 会计损益表.  

Bob Herz, the FASB's chairman, *cried out*(`=to shout sth loudly`) against those who "*question*(v.) our motives." ② Yet bank shares *rose*(=rise) and the changes *enhance*(`= to increase or further improve the good quality, value or status of sb/sth`) what one lobby group *politely calls* "the use of judgment by management."

美国FASB(财务会计准则委员会)在与国会激烈摩擦之后，匆匆通过了规则的修改。这些修改使得银行在使用模型评估非流动资产方面, 拥有更大的自由，同时使得它们确认收益表中长期资产损失时, 更为灵活。FASB主席Bob Herz大声反对那些“怀疑我们的动机”的人们。然而银行股票上涨了，这些修改, 强化了“管理层使用理性判断”的说法，这种说法是一个游说团的客气之言。

European ministers *instantly demanded* that the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) *do* likewise. ② The IASB *says* {it *does not want to act* without overall(`=including all the things or people that are involved in a particular situation; general`) planning, but the pressure *to fold*(`=to close because it is not successful`) [when it *completes* it reconstruction 重建 of rules later this year] *is* strong}. ③ Charlie McCreevy, a European commissioner(`=an official group of people who are responsible for controlling sth or finding out about sth`), *warned* the IASB that {it *did "not live in* a political vacuum 真空" but "in the real word" and that Europe *could yet develop* different rules}.

欧洲的部长们立刻要求国际会计准则委员会(IASB)也这么做。IASB表示，它不想没有完整计划就冒然行动，但它在今年下半年完成规则修订时，必须屈服的压力十分巨大。欧洲委员会委员Charlie McCreevy警告IASB说：它不是“处在政治真空中”而是“在现实世界里”，并表示欧洲可能最终会发展出不同的会计规则。

*It* was banks *that* were on the wrong planet, with accounts that *vastly(ad.)(`=very much`) overvalued*(`=to place its value at too high a level compared with other similar things`) assets. ② Today they *argue* that {market prices *overstate*(`=to say sth in a way that makes it seem more important than it really is`) losses, because they *largely reflect* the temporary illiquidity(n.)非流动性；非现金的；不能立即付现 of markets, not the likely extent(n.)(`=how large, important, serious, etc. sth is`) of bad debts}. ③ The truth *will not be known* for years.  

正是这些银行呆错了星球，它们的账目上充斥着估值过高的资产。现在他们争论道市价高估了损失，因为市价主要反映了市场的暂时性流动性不足，而非坏账的可能范围。几年中没人会知道真相。

But bank's shares *trade below* their book(`=the written records of the financial affairs of a business`) value(公司资产的)账面价值, *suggesting* that investors are skeptical(a.)(`=having doubts that a claim or statement is true or that sth will happen`). ② And dead markets(证券)死市(市场不景气) *partly reflect* the paralysis(n.)(`=a total inability to move, act, function, etc`) of banks which *will not sell* assets *for fear of* booking losses 帐面亏损, yet *are* reluctant(a.)(`=hesitating before doing sth because you do not want to do it /or because you are not sure that it is the right thing to do`) *to buy* all those supposed(a.)误以为的;误信的;所谓的;据说 bargains(`=a thing bought for less than the usual price`).

但是，银行股票以低于账面价值的价格交易，这一点反应了投资者的怀疑。死寂的市场一定程度上反应了瘫痪的银行由于怕账面损失，既不愿出售资产，也不愿意去购买那些看似不错的廉价资产。

*To get* the system *working again*, losses *must be recognized* and *dealt with*. ② America's new plan *to buy up*(`=to buy all or as much as possible of sth`) toxic assets *will not work* unless banks *mark*(v.) assets *to* levels which buyers *find* attractive.  ③ Successful markets *require* independent and even combative(a.)(`=ready and willing to fight or argue`) standard-setters. ④ The FASB and IASB *have been* exactly(`=is correct in every way or in every detail`) that, *cleaning up* rules on stock options(`=a right given to employees to buy shares in their company at a fixed price`) and pensions, for example, *against* hostility(`=unfriendly or aggressive feelings or behaviour`) *from* special interests 特殊利益集团. ⑤ But [by *giving in 屈从；让步 to* critics now] they *are inviting*(`=to make sth, especially sth bad or unpleasant, likely to happen`) pressure *to make* more concessions(`=something that you allow or do, or allow sb to have, in order to end an argument or to make a situation less difficult`).

====
-  *stock option == share option* : a right given to employees to buy shares in their company at a fixed price 股票期权，认股选择权（让员工可按固定价格购买所属公司的股票）
- concession => con-加强意义 + -cess-退让 + -ion名词词尾
====

为了让银行系统重新运转起来，损失必须被确认和处理。美国收购有毒资产的新计划，只有在银行将资产定价在足够吸引买家的水平上才会有效。成熟的市场需要独立的，甚至是好斗的准则制定者。FASB和IASB以往正是这样对抗特殊利益集团的敌意的，例如改进股权和退休金的相关规则。但是现在向批评者妥协是自寻压力，他们会进一步做出让步。
