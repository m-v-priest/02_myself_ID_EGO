== 03. Academic sexism


Academic(a.)(`=involving a lot of reading and studying rather than practical or technical skills 学术的（与实践性、技术性相对）`) sexism(n.)(`= the unfair treatment of people, especially women, because of their sex; the attitude that causes this （尤指对女性的）性别歧视，性别偏见`)


A dispiriting(`=making sb lose their hope or enthusiasm 令人沮丧的；使人气馁的`) survey of women’s lot(n.)(`=a person's luck or situation in life 命运；生活状况`) in university economics

对大学经济学中女性命运的一次令人沮丧的调查

====
- sexism => sex,性别，-ism,主义，思想，词源同 ageism,老年歧视。
- dispirited => dis-, 不，非，使相反。spirited, 有精气神的。

“WHY IS THIS an interesting question?” `主` Éva Nagypál, then a junior(`= ~ (to sb) having a low rank in an organization or a profession 地位（或职位、级别）低下的`) economist *presenting*(`=to show or offer sth for other people to look at or consider 提出；提交; /(~ sth /~ sth/sb/yourself as sth) to show or describe sth/sb in a particular way （以某种方式）展现，显示，表现`) research *at* her first academic conference, `谓` *had barely finished* her opening sentence.

那时还是一名初级经济学家的埃娃·纳吉帕尔(Éva Nagypál), 在她的第一次学术会议上发表研究报告，当她刚刚说完开场白, 就被人发问:"为什么这是一个有趣的问题?"。

She *still remembers* the interruption [many years on](`=You use on when mentioning an event that was followed by another one. 在…之后`).

====
- on : PREP You use *on* when mentioning an event that was followed by another one. 在…之后 +
-> She waited in her hotel to welcome her children *on* their arrival from Vancouver.
她在旅馆等着迎接将从温哥华回来的孩子们。
====

Later she *came to learn that* such rudeness *was* quite normal, and that economists *were capable(`=~ of sth/of doing sth having the ability or qualities necessary for doing sth 有能力；有才能`) of worse*.

As a young woman, she *also experienced* some “inappropriate”(a.)(`=~ (for sb/sth) (to do sth) /~ (to/for sth) : not suitable or appropriate in a particular situation 不适当的；不合适的`) behaviour, but *brushed(`=to rudely ignore sb or refuse to listen to them 不理睬某人；打发;（用刷子）刷净,掸掉`) it off*. “I *could handle it*,” she says.

*Being told* she was “technically good, but not very creative” *was harder to stomach*(v.)(`=to be able to eat sth without feeling ill/sick 能吃；吃得下(进入胃；腹部); /to approve of sth and be able to enjoy it; to enjoy being with a person 欣赏；欣然接受；喜欢和…相处`). She *left academic economics* in 2009.

她多年后仍然记得那次被打断的情景。后来她了解到，这种粗鲁是很正常的，而经济学家有可能做得更糟。作为一名年轻女性，她也经历过一些“不恰当”的行为，但她并不在意。“我可以应付，”她说。但在被告知她“技术很好，但不是很有创造力”则是很难接受的。她在2009年离开了学术经济学的职业。

====
- inappropriate =>  in-不,无 + ap-加强意义 + -propri-适当的,本身所有的 + -ate形容词词尾

- *brush off* : to be removed by brushing 被刷掉；被拂去 +
-> *Mud brushes off easily* when it is dry. 泥巴干了容易刷掉。
- *brush sb off* : to rudely ignore sb or refuse to listen to them 不理睬某人；打发 +
-> She brushed him off impatiently. 她不耐烦地把他打发走了。
- *brush sb/yourself off* : to make sb/yourself tidy, especially after you have fallen, by brushing your clothes, etc. with your hands 掸净某人╱自己，拂去衣服上的灰尘（尤指摔跤后）
====

Economists *have tended to be wary(a.)(`=~ (of sb/sth) /~ (of doing sth) : careful when dealing with sb/sth because you think that there may be a danger or problem （对待人或事物时）小心的，谨慎的，留神的，小心翼翼的`) of* *reading*(v.) too much *into*(`=*read sth (into sth)* : to take information from a disk 读盘；从磁盘提取信息`) anecdotes(`=a short, interesting or amusing story about a real person or event 逸事；趣闻`) like Ms Nagypál’s.

====
- wary => 来自 PIE wer,覆盖，保护，看管，看护，词源同 ward,ware.引申词义谨慎的。
====

A single data point(`= 数据点.因为本文讲的是经济学家么, 所以就用了经济学研究中的"数据点", 来代表本人物案例. 不过point也有另一个意思: a particular detail or fact 具体细节（或事实）`) *does not prove that* women *are picked on*(`= pick on sb/sth : to treat sb unfairly, by blaming, criticizing or punishing them （跟某人）闹别扭；故意刁难挑剔`) or *pushed away*.

Even Ms Nagypál’s departure(n.)(`= ~ (from...) the act of leaving a place; an example of this 离开；起程；出发`) from academia *was complicated*.

She *liked* her colleagues at Northwestern University, but *felt drawn(`=~ sb (to sth) : to attract or interest sb 吸引；招引；使感兴趣`) to* more collaborative(a.)(`=involving, or done by, several people or groups of people working together 合作的；协作的；协力的`), policy-relevant research.

The pull of her family *was* also a factor.

经济学家们倾向于谨慎地看待像Nagypal女士这样的轶事。单凭一个数据事实, 并不能证明女性是被人故意刁难的。即使是Nagypal女士离开学术界的原因也很复杂。她喜欢西北大学(Northwestern University)的同事们，但对更具合作性、与政策相关的研究更感兴趣。家庭的牵引力也是一个因素。


But harder(`= definitely true and based on information that can be proved 确凿的；可证实的；可靠的`) evidence of something amiss(a.)(`=wrong; not as it should be 不对；不正常`) *is building*.

Granted(ad.)（表示肯定属实，然后再作另一番表述）不错，的确, more women *are attaining senior 级别（或地位）高的 positions* in university economics 经济学.

But women *make up*(`= to form sth 形成；构成`) only around 30% of PhD students, and *are* likelier than men *to drop away*(`=to fall or go away gradually 逐渐坠落; 逐渐远去`) as they *climb the career ladder*.

但更确凿的证据正在形成。诚然，越来越多的女性获得了大学经济学的高级职位。但是，女性只占博士生总数的30%左右，而且在职业生涯的阶梯上，女性比男性更有可能中途放弃。

Among a group of 43 leading American universities, the female share 一份 of PhD students *has been essentially  本质上；根本上；基本上 flat* 水平的；平坦的 for two decades (see chart 1).

That of assistant 助理；助手 professors *has fallen* since 2009.

Progress *seems to have been* a little slower *than* in some natural sciences, and economics *remains* far behind other social sciences.

在美国43所顶尖大学中，女性博士生的比例在过去20年里基本持平(见表1)，而助理教授的比例自2009年以来一直在下降。进展似乎比一些自然科学要慢一些，而经济学仍然远远落后于其他社会科学。

`主` *Quantifying*(`=to describe or express sth as an amount or a number 以数量表述；量化`) the effects of *such* fuzzy(a.)(`=confused and not expressed clearly 糊涂的；含混不清的;/（形状或声音）模糊不清的`) notions(`=an idea, a belief or an understanding of sth 观念；信念；理解`) *as*(`=这个as是个前面的such组合成 such as的`) behaviour and culture `系` *is* hard.

But the American Economics Association (AEA), the leading professional body for academic economists, *has attempted to do just that*.

对"行为和文化"这样模糊的概念, 来量化其影响, 是困难的。但美国经济协会(AEA)，学术经济学家的主要专业机构，正试图这样做。

On March 18th the AEA *published* the findings of a survey of its members, *examining* the “professional climate”(`=a general attitude or feeling; an atmosphere or a situation which exists in a particular place 倾向；思潮；风气；环境气氛`).

The survey *reveals many more data points* 数据点 than one, and *finds* plenty of evidence of harassment(n.)(`=Harassment is behaviour which is intended to trouble or annoy someone, for example repeated attacks on them or attempts to cause them problems. 骚扰`) and discrimination(`=~ (against sb)~ (in favour of sb) : the practice of treating sb or a particular group in society less fairly than others 区别对待；歧视；偏袒`).

3月18日，AEA公布了对其成员的调查结果，调查了“职业氛围”。调查揭示了不止一个数据点案例，并发现了大量骚扰和歧视的证据。
====
-  discrimination => dis-分开 + crimin(-cern-)区分 + -ation
====

More than 9,000 economists, or 20% of those eligible 有资格的；合格的；具备条件的, *completed the survey*.

Only two-fifths of respondents 回答问题的人；（尤指）被调查的对象 *reported that* they *felt “valued* within...economics”. But women and non-whites *tended to feel worst*.

They *were more likely to report unfair treatment* when *seeking an academic job* and [in pay and promotion].

Almost half of women *reported* experiencing(v.) discrimination *based on their sex*.

Among non-whites of both sexes, 29% *complained of* discrimination *on the basis(n.)(`=the reason why people take a particular action 原因；缘由`) of* ethnicity.


超过9,000名经济学家(合资格人数的20%)完成了调查。只有五分之二的受访者表示，他们觉得自己“在……经济领域中,受到重视”。 而女性和非白人往往感觉最糟。他们更有可能在寻求学术工作、薪酬和晋升方面, 受到不公平待遇。几乎一半的女性报告说她们受到了性别歧视。在非白人中，29%的人抱怨种族歧视。

It is possible that the sample is biased(a.)有偏见的；倾向性的；片面的, *pushing up* the apparent frequency of discrimination.

The disgruntled(a.)(`=~ (at sb/sth) annoyed or disappointed because sth has happened to upset you 不满的；不高兴的`) *may have been especially keen(`=~ (to do sth) /~ (that...) /~ (on doing sth) : ( especially BrE ) wanting to do sth or wanting sth to happen very much 渴望；热切；热衷于`) to* have their say.

Against that, the survey *may have struggled to reach those* who *had been [so] discouraged(v.)(`= ~ sb (from doing sth) : to make sb feel less confident or enthusiastic about doing sth 使灰心；使泄气；使丧失信心`) by* their experience *[that]* they *had left* the profession altogether.

有可能样本是有偏见的，这就推高了明显歧视的频率。心怀不满的人可能特别渴望表达自己的意见。与此相反，这项调查可能很难接触到那些对自己的经历非常气馁，以至于完全离开了这一职业的人。
====
- disgruntled => dis-, 不，非，极其(不好的感觉)。grunt, 抱怨，咕哝，拟声词。并由于对该词前缀dis-的错误理解回构出gruntle, 使高兴，使满意。
====

In any case 无论如何;不管怎样, the survey *yielded*(`=to produce or provide sth, for example a profit, result or crop 出产（作物）；产生（收益、效益等）；提供`) more than enough reports of sexual harassment(`=Harassment is behaviour which is intended to trouble or annoy someone, for example repeated attacks on them /or attempts to cause them problems. 骚扰`).

Nearly 2,000 respondents *said* they *had been embarrassed or offended by* inappropriate(a.)(`=not suitable or appropriate in a particular situation 不适当的；不合适的`) gestures(`= something that you do or say to show a particular feeling or intention （表明感情或意图的）姿态，表示; / 手势；姿势；示意动作`), remarks or materials *from* other economists.

无论如何，调查得出的性骚扰报告已经足够多了。近2000名受访者表示，他们曾因其他经济学家不当示意姿势、言论或材料而感到尴尬或被冒犯。

Hundreds *reported* experiences of *attempted(a.)(`=( of a crime, etc. 犯罪等 ) that sb has tried to do but without success 未遂的`) or actual sexual assault(n.)(`=~ (on/upon sb) the crime of attacking sb physically 侵犯他人身体（罪）；侵犯人身罪`) by a colleague or student in the past ten years.

And 267 *reported that* they *would ① have been rewarded* [条件状 *had they co-operated with* unwanted sexual attention(`=interest that people show in sb/sth 兴趣；关注; /special care, action or treatment 特别照料（或行动、处理）`)], or ② *threatened with* retaliation(n.)(`=~ (against sb/sth) (for sth) : action that a person takes against sb who has harmed them in some way 报复`) [had they not].

报告说，在过去的十年里，有数百人遭遇过同事或学生的试图或实实在在的性侵犯经历。267人报告说，如果他们在不想要的性关注下合作，他们会得到奖励。或者, 如果他们不合作，就会受到报复的威胁.

====
- retaliate => 来自拉丁语 retaliare,偿还，返还，来自 *re-,向后，往回，talis,同样，同类*，来自 PIE tod,指 示代词，*词源同 this,that.即原样返还的，后用于指报仇*，以眼还眼，以牙还牙。
====


These figures *are* still fairly raw(a.)(`= not yet organized into a form in which it can be easily used or understood 未经处理的；未经分析的；原始的`).

[Later this year] the AEA *will release* further analysis(n.), for example *comparing* the results *with* surveys(n.) from other academic disciplines(`=an area of knowledge; a subject that people study or are taught, especially in a university 知识领域；（尤指大学的）学科，科目`).

However economics *measures up*(`=to measure sb/sth 测量；量度`), abuses of power *are probably widespread*(a.).

A meta-analysis 荟萃分析；元分析 of studies of the prevalence(n.)(`=the fact that something is very common or happens often 流行, 普遍盛行`) of sexual harassment in 2003 *ranked* 把…分等级；属于某等级 academia *second* only to the armed forces.

这些数字还相当原始。今年晚些时候，AEA将发布进一步的分析，例如将结果与其他学科的调查进行比较。不管经济学如何衡量，滥用权力可能是普遍的。2003年时,一项对性骚扰流行情况的荟萃分析显示，学术界仅次于军队。

The Economist 经济学人 *has supplemented*(`=to add sth to sth in order to improve it or make it more complete 增补；补充`) the AEA’s survey *by interviewing* 30 members of the profession, some *speaking* [on condition of anonymity(n.)(`=the state of remaining unknown to most other people 匿名；不知姓名；名字不公开`)], *to understand* {where and why problems *exist*}.

*Most were women* and *at* highly regarded universities. Most *had* tenure(`=the right to stay permanently in your job, especially as a teacher at a university （尤指大学教师的）终身职位，长期聘用`).

Most *reported that* their colleagues *were kind* and *that* they enjoyed academic life. But their experiences *varied widely*. And all of them *said that* the profession *had its problems*.

====
- tenure =>  -ten-握,持有 + -ure名词词尾
====

《经济学人》补充了AEA的调查，采访了30位经济学家，其中一些人被调查者安排为匿名状态述说，目的是为了了解问题的所在和原因。其中大多数是女性，就读于知名大学。大多数人都有终身教职。大多数人表示，他们的同事都很友善，而且他们很享受学术生活。但他们的经历差异很大。他们都说这个职业有它的问题。


One reported *receiving* too many comments on her appearance.

Another *said* a fellow graduate 学士学位获得者 student *had been stalked*(`=to move slowly and quietly towards an animal or a person, in order to kill, catch or harm it or them （非法）跟踪，盯梢;偷偷接近，潜近（猎物或人）`).

Some *spoke of* a set of senior men who *were* notorious(a.)(`=well known for being bad 声名狼藉的；臭名昭著的`) sources of unwanted attention [after a few drinks].

Others *mentioned* an academic who *had been edged out of*(`=to move sb from their position or job gradually, especially when they are not fully aware of what is happening 逐渐将…排挤出`) a university department after several complaints(n.) against him, *including* some (*by* graduate students), of(这里的of是修饰前面的complaints的) unwanted sexual advances(n.)(`=attempts to start a sexual relationship with sb 勾引；求爱；追求`). He *was then promoted*(`= to move sb to a higher rank or more senior job 提升；晋升`) at a different university.

====
- 本句最后一部分的核心骨架是: Others *mentioned* an academic who *had been* ... after *several complaints of* unwanted sexual advances.

- advances [ pl. ] : attempts to start a sexual relationship with sb 勾引；求爱；追求 +
-> He *had made advances(n.) to* one of his students. 他曾追求过他的一个学生。
====


其中一人表示，她的外貌收到了太多评论。另一个人说他的一个研究生同事被人非法跟踪了。一些人提到了一群资深男性，他们在几杯酒下肚后就成了实施骚扰的"不想要的关注"的源头。还有人提到了一位学者，他在几次投诉(包括研究生对他的投诉)后被大学院系开除，其中一些投诉是不受欢迎的性侵犯。然后他在另一所大学获得了晋升。



Our interviewees *found* it much easier *to name* prominent bullies *than* notorious harassers 骚扰者.

A senior professor *said that* she *had seen* a special nastiness 不洁,污秽;肮脏,龌龊 (*reserved(`= If you preserve food, you treat it in order to prevent it from decaying so that you can store it for a long time. 保藏`) for* people *regarded as* 看待为, 视为 vulnerable(`=weak and easily hurt physically or emotionally （身体上或感情上）脆弱的，易受…伤害的`), *including* women.)

Others *claimed*(`=to say that sth is true although it has not been proved and other people may not believe it 宣称；声称；断言`) *only to have seen “assholes”* 屁眼;混蛋,很讨厌的人 who were indiscriminate(a.)(`=an indiscriminate action is done without thought about what the result may be, especially when it causes people to be harmed 随意的；恣意的；不加选择的`) in their aggression(`=a violent attack or threats by one person against another person /or by one country against another country 侵犯；挑衅；侵略`).

我们的受访者发现，比起臭名昭著的骚扰者，说出有名的恶霸要容易得多。一位资深教授说，她发现了一种特别的肮脏，专门保留给并施加在那些被视为脆弱的人身上，包括女性。另一些人则声称, 他们只看到了那些不论对方身份为何人, 都无差别进行骚扰的“混蛋”。
====
- vulnerable => 来自拉丁语 vulnus,伤口，来自 PIE wele,拔，击打，词源同 wool,vulture.引申词义有伤口的， 脆弱的。
- indiscriminate => dis-, 分开，散开。-crim, 区分，词源同crime, crisis. 即区分开，区别对待，歧视。
====

*Uncovering(`=to discover sth that was previously hidden or secret 发现；揭露；揭发`) and fixing* such faults *is* difficult.

Like any profession, economics *is* hierarchical(`=arranged in a hierarchy 按等级划分的；等级制度的`).

*As* in other academic disciplines, success *depends on* peer review. A formal complaint against someone (higher up the ladder) *invites*(`=to make sth, especially sth bad or unpleasant, likely to happen 招致（尤指坏事）`) retaliation 报复.

Your research *may be trashed*(`=to throw away sth that you do not want 丢弃；把…抛弃`).

Your chances 机会，际遇 of promotion *may be blighted*(`=to spoil or damage sth, especially by causing a lot of problems 损害；妨害；贻害`).

If the perpetrator(`=a person who commits a crime or does sth that is wrong or evil 作恶者；行凶者；犯罪者`) *is* at a different university, you *may not even know* who to complain to.

发现和修复这些缺陷是困难的。与任何职业一样，经济学也是分等级的。和其他学科一样，成功取决于同行的评价。对上级的正式投诉会招致报复。你的研究成果可能会付诸东流。你晋升的机会可能会落空。如果犯罪者在另一所大学，你甚至都不知道该向谁投诉。
====
- blight => 词源不详，该词来自于农业用语，*原指植物叶上的斑点，可能同blemish, 斑点。*-ght, 拼写模仿eight, fight, light, night 等。 / vt.使…枯萎vi.枯萎n.枯萎病 词源解释：可能来自古英语blæce，用来表示一种农作物疾病。 助记窍门：blight→谐音“不来”+light（光）→不来阳光→植物枯萎 衍生词：blighted（枯萎的）
====


The potential 可能性；潜在性 for abuse of power *starts early*.

There *is* a growing trend for young economists *to work as* research assistants to leading academics, *as a pathway into* prestigious(`= respected and admired as very important or of very high quality 有威望的；声誉高的`) PhD programmes.

====
- prestige => 它源自praestringere，*由prae（pre，在……前面）+ stringere（捆绑）*，字面意思就是“在人面前假装把自己捆绑起来”。prestige的本意是指高超的魔术师所创造出的令人匪夷所思、叹为观止的幻觉，这种幻觉能使观众如痴如醉，从而对观众产生巨大的影响力，*对魔术师五体投地、敬若神明。* 因此prestige一词也就衍生出“影响力、声望”的含义。
====

If the academic *refuses to write them* a good reference 推荐信；介绍信, their career *may be over* before it *even starts*.

PhD students are just as *reliant(a.)(`= on/upon sb/sth : needing sb/sth in order to survive, be successful, etc. 依赖性的；依靠的`) on* their seniors 级别（或地位）较高者；上级；上司.

Success *requires* letters of recommendation 推荐；介绍, invitations to conferences （通常持续几天的大型正式）会议，研讨会, help(n.) with research ideas and perhaps *joint research*.

[In all these areas] women *were far likelier to report* unfair treatment *than men* in the AEA’s survey (see chart 2). Non-whites *were also more likely to report it* than whites.


滥用权力的可能性很早就开始了。年轻经济学家越来越倾向于担任顶尖学者的研究助理，以此作为进入著名博士项目的途径。如果学术界拒绝给他们写一份好的推荐信，他们的职业生涯可能还没开始就结束了。博士生也同样依赖他们的前辈。成功需要推荐信、会议邀请函、对研究想法的帮助，或许还需要联合研究。在AEA的调查中，在所有这些领域，女性比男性更有可能报告受到不公平的待遇(见表2)。非白人也比白人更有可能报告这一问题。


Unfair treatment *can be unwitting*(a.)(`= not aware of what you are doing or of the situation you are involved in 不知情的；糊里糊涂的；无意的`). Senior professors *may be unconsciously drawn(`=to attract or interest sb 吸引；招引；使感兴趣`) to favour* students who *look like* their younger selves(`=self的复数. 自己`).

They *may like chatting about work* over a drink, which young women *may find uncomfortable*. One PhD student *said* she *felt that* {female students *found it harder* to connect with male professors}. She *suspected* {that *was partly due to* unspoken worries about harassment}.

不公平的待遇, 可能是无意识中造成的。资深教授可能会无意识地偏爱那些看起来像他们年轻时的自己的学生。他们可能喜欢边喝酒边谈工作，这可能会让年轻女性感到不舒服。一位博士生说，她觉得女学生很难与男教授沟通。她怀疑这在一定程度上是由于对骚扰的潜在担忧。

On the job market, too, interviewees(`=the person who answers the questions in an interview 参加面试者；接受采访者`) *detected*(`=to discover or notice sth, especially sth that is not easy to see, hear, etc. 发现；查明；侦察出`) implicit 含蓄的；不直接言明的 bias 偏见；偏心；偏向.

One senior woman *recalled*(`=to remember sth 记起；回忆起；回想起`) hearing(v.) statements(`=something that you say or write that gives information or an opinion 说明；说法；表白；表态`) such as “Her paper is really good -- she works really hard” *alongside those* like “His paper is OK but he’s super-smart.”

在就业市场上，受访者也发现了隐性偏见。一位资深女性回忆说，她听到有人说“她的论文真的很好——她工作真的很努力”，旁边则是 “他的论文虽然一般，但他超聪明”。

Writers of recommendation 推荐；介绍 letters *may not take into account* time off 休假；请假 for child-rearing(`=
the process of caring for children as they grow up, teaching them how to behave as members of society 抚养；养育；培养`).

Women *may be held(`=to keep sb/sth in a particular position 使保持（在某位置）`) to higher standards* in evaluations 评价；[审计] 评估；估价 of their research.

Two recent studies(n.) by Erin Hengel of the University of Liverpool *found that* their papers are more readable(`=that is easy, interesting and enjoyable to read 可读性强的；通俗易懂的`) *than* those written by men /and *cited 引用；援引 more often*, suggesting a higher hurdle （供人或马在赛跑中跨越的）栏架，跨栏;难关；障碍 for publication （书刊等的）出版，发行；出版物.

写推荐信的人可能没有考虑到女性要抚养孩子的休假时间。在对她们的研究进行评价时，妇女可能被要求遵守更高的标准。利物浦大学(University of Liverpool)的艾琳•亨格尔(Erin Hengel)最近的两项研究发现，女性的论文比男性的具有更高的可读性，被引用的频率也更高，这意味着她们发表论文的门槛更高。

Heather Sarsons of the University of Toronto *has found that* women *get a smaller boost* than men in their chances of tenure(`=the right to stay permanently in your job, especially as a teacher at a university （尤指大学教师的）终身职位，长期聘用`) *from* each paper they co-write.

多伦多大学(University of Toronto)的希瑟•萨尔森(Heather Sarsons)发现，女性因合著的每篇论文, 从而获得终身职位的几率, 比男性要小。

Then there is the style of seminars （大学教师带领学生作专题讨论的）研讨课, for which economics *is* notorious.

Interruptions and intense(`=having or showing very strong feelings, opinions or thoughts about sb/sth 有强烈感情（或意见、想法）的；尖锐的；热切的`) questioning *are supposed to weed(`= 除（地面的）杂草`) out(`=weed out : to remove or get rid of people or things from a group because they are not wanted or are less good than the rest 清除，剔除，淘汰（不需要的或较差的人或物）`) errors* and *uncover(`=to discover sth that was previously hidden or secret 发现；揭露；揭发`) sloppy(`=that shows a lack of care, thought or effort 马虎的；凌乱的；草率的`) thinking*.

====
- sloppy => slop,泥浆，-y,形容词后缀。引申比喻义马虎的，草率的。
====
还有一种问题, 是研讨会的风格，经济学在这方面臭名昭著。打断他人发言, 和激烈的提问, 被看做是能排除错误，并发现马虎想法。

And several interviewees *told of* supportive(`=giving help, encouragement or sympathy to sb 给予帮助的；支持的；鼓励的；同情的`) sub-fields and departments, where the primary purpose *was not* to tear down the speaker. But one *said* she *felt like quitting* after *seeing* how a female presenter *was treated*.

Another economist *reported* being asked during a presentation(`=a meeting at which sth, especially a new product or idea, or piece of work, is shown to a group of people 展示会；介绍会；发布会`) whether she *knew* any economics, and *being interrupted incessantly* 不停地，不间断地.

几位受访者谈到了支持性的子领域和部门，那里的主要目的不是诋毁演讲者。但其中一位表示，在看到一位女发言人遭受的待遇后，她想要退出。另一位经济学家报告说，她在一次演讲中被问及是否懂经济学，她的发言也不时被打断。

*Even if* everyone *gets* the same treatment, minority groups (which in economics *includes* women) *may find* such an environment unpleasant.

The PhD students we spoke to *said* they *were put off*(`=to make sb lose interest in or enthusiasm for sth/sb 使失去兴趣（或热情）`) by the seminar （大学教师带领学生作专题讨论的）研讨课 style.

即使每个人都得到了同样的待遇，少数群体(在经济学中, 包括女性)可能会发现这样的环境令人不快。我们采访的博士生说，他们对研讨会的风格感到反感。

Among macroeconomists 宏观经济学, whose field *is both* particularly short of women *and* infamous 臭名远扬的；声名狼藉的 for bare-knuckled 不用拳击手套的 seminars, 40% of those *responding to* the AEA’s survey *felt* “disrespected”(`=a lack of respect for sb/sth 不尊敬；无礼；轻蔑`); among female macroeconomists, 70% did.

宏观经济学家的研究领域尤其缺乏女性，而且以不戴拳击手套的(不留情面的)研讨会而臭名昭著。在接受美国经济学会调查的人中，40%的人感到“不受尊重”；在女性宏观经济学家中，70%的人感到“不受尊重”。

Change *will be* slow. Assessments 评估;评定；核定 of young economists’ potential *will always be* subjective 主观的（非客观的） [to a degree 在某种程度上在一定程度上].

Some senior economists *shudder* （因寒冷、害怕或激动）发抖，打颤，战栗, with justification 正当理由, *at the thought of* sitting through a sloppy  马虎的；凌乱的；草率的 seminar [in silence], and *worry that* a cuddlier(`=cuddly的比较级 : if a person is cuddly , they make you want to cuddle them 令人想拥抱的;/柔软而令人想搂抱的`) environment *will soften* intellectual rigour(n.)(`=the fact of being careful and paying great attention to detail 谨慎；缜密；严谨`).

====
- cuddle => 词源不详，可能来自collar,领口。
====
变化将是缓慢的。对年轻经济学家潜力的评估在一定程度上总是主观的。一些资深经济学家一想到要默默地坐在一个草率的研讨会上，就不寒而栗，这是情有可原的，他们担心更舒适的环境会软化学术上的严谨性。

But experimentation 实验；试验；尝试 *is happening*. Some departments *have begun to try* different seminar styles, for example *insisting that* presenters *should be allowed* a minimum time *to speak* before *being interrupted*.

Some *have circulated*(`=to send goods or information to all the people in a group 传送；传递；传阅`) reminders(n.)(`=something that makes you think about or remember sb/sth, that you have forgotten or would like to forget 引起回忆的事物；提醒人的事物; /a letter or note informing sb that they have not done sth （告知该做某事的）通知单，提示信`) that people *should raise a hand* before *asking a question*, or *be mindful of* the time they *are taking* as they *make their point*.

但新的实验已经正在进行。一些部门已经开始尝试不同以往的研讨会风格，例如, 坚持要求在打断演讲者之前, 允许他们有最低限度的发言时间。有些人还在传阅各种提示，提醒人们在提问之前应该先举手，或者在表达观点的时候,注意自己花了多少时间。

Ideas *are circulating* about ways *to attract and support* junior and female researchers.

The most recent issue(n.)(`=one of a regular series of magazines or newspapers 一期；期号;/the act of supplying or making available things for people to buy or use 发行；分发`) of the Journal of Economic Perspectives(n.)(`=a particular attitude towards sth; a way of thinking about sth 态度；观点；思考方法`) *contained* a collection of papers on the determinants(`=a thing that decides whether or how sth happens 决定因素；决定条件`) of women’s success in PhD programmes /and ways *to “make* economics *work for* women [at every stage]”.

关于如何吸引和支持初级和女性研究人员的想法, 正在流传。最新一期的《经济展望期刊》(Journal of Economic Perspectives)收录了一系列论文, 探讨了女性在博士课程中取得成功的决定因素, 以及“让经济学在每个阶段都为女性服务”的方法。

One, by Leah Boustan and Andrew Langan of Princeton University, *found that* `主` departments *with* better outcomes(`=the result or effect of an action or event 结果；效果`) *for* junior women `谓` *also hired* more female faculty(`=all the teachers in a faculty of a college or university （高等院校中院、系的）全体教师`) members, *provided* “collegial”(`=relating to a college 学院的`) research seminars /and *were more aware of* gender issues.

其中一项是普林斯顿大学的利亚•布斯坦和安德鲁•兰根的研究，他们发现，对初级女性有更好结果的院系, 也会聘用更多的女性教员，并提供“学院式”的研究研讨会，并能更关注性别问题。


Another paper by Mr Langan, *covering*(`=to include sth; to deal with sth 包括；包含；涉及；处理`) accounting 会计, sociology and political science *as well as* 也；和…一样；不但…而且 economics, *found that* when women *become* department chairs, the female share(n.) of graduate students *goes up* with no deterioration(`=to become worse 变坏；恶化；退化`) in candidates’ quality.

Women in those departments also *publish more papers* and *are likelier to get tenure* （尤指大学教师的）终身职位，长期聘用.

The difference *may lie in* female heads of department *sharing out*(`=to divide sth between two or more people 分配；分摊`) non-academic duties [more fairly]. Over 40% of the women in the AEA’s survey *reported* being given(v.) a disproportionate 不成比例的；不相称的；太大（或太小）的 load.

兰根的另一篇论文涵盖了会计学、社会学、政治学以及经济学。该论文发现，当女性担任系主任时，研究生中女性比例上升，而候选人的素质没有下降。这些部门的女性也会发表更多论文，更有可能获得终身职位。造成这种不同后果的原因可能在于，女性的系主任, 更公平地分担了非学术职责。在美国教育协会的调查中，超过40%的女性称, 自己承担了不成比例的工作量。


Young economists *are also speaking out*(`=SPEAK OUT (AGAINST STH) : to state your opinions publicly, especially in opposition to sth and in a way that takes courage 挺身（反对某事物）；公开站出来（反对）`).

Last year the New York Times *reported that* Roland Fryer, a prominent economist at Harvard, *had been found* by the university *to have created* a hostile(a.)(`=very unfriendly or aggressive and ready to argue or fight 敌意的；敌对的; /making it difficult for sth to happen or to be achieved 有阻碍的；不利的`) work environment *for* research assistants in his laboratory, which he *denies*.

年轻的经济学家也在大声疾呼。去年，《纽约时报》(the New York Times)报道称，哈佛大学(Harvard)发现著名经济学家罗兰·弗莱尔(Roland Fryer)在自己的实验室里, 给研究助理创造了一个充满障碍的工作环境，弗莱尔对此予以否认。去年12月，弗莱尔从美国教育协会执行委员会辞职后，来自数十所大学的数百名研究助理和研究生, 在网络杂志Medium上签署了一封公开信，指出, 这种不良现象“在研究生和初级教师中, 常常是公开的秘密”。

Some *have accused* economists *of* being slow *to tackle(`= to make a determined effort to deal with a difficult problem or situation 应付，处理，解决（难题或局面）; / (橄榄球或美式足球)擒抱摔倒；阻截;铲断`) discrimination* in their profession 行业，职业 because of their conviction(n.)(`=the feeling or appearance of believing sth strongly and of being sure about it 深信；坚信；坚定；肯定`) that market forces *would drive it out*(`=drive sb/sth out (of sth) : to make sb/sth disappear or stop doing sth 驱散；消除；使停止`).

一些人指责经济学家在解决职业歧视问题上, 行动迟缓，因为他们坚信，市场力量会将歧视赶走。

“这更像是一种善意的忽视，”美联储前主席、AEA主席,本•伯南克(Ben Bernanke)表示。“没有人说,我们应该阻止女性成为经济学家。但也没有很多人表示，我们应该采取积极肯定的措施，来让更广泛的人群更容易接触到它。”

== 03. Academic sexism 纯净版

A dispiriting survey of women’s lot(n.) in university economics


Mar 21st 2019 | WASHINGTON, DC

“WHY IS THIS an interesting question?” `主` Éva Nagypál, then a junior economist *presenting research* at her first academic conference, `谓` *had barely finished* her opening sentence. She *still remembers* the interruption many years on. Later she *came to learn that* such rudeness *was quite normal*, and that economists *were capable of worse*. As a young woman, she *also experienced* some “inappropriate” behaviour, but *brushed it off*. “I *could handle it*,” she says. *Being told* she was “technically good, but not very creative” *was harder to stomach*. She *left academic economics* in 2009.

Economists *have tended to be wary(a.) of* *reading too much into* anecdotes like Ms Nagypál’s. A single data point *does not prove* that women *are picked on* or *pushed away*. Even Ms Nagypál’s departure from academia *was* complicated. She *liked* her colleagues at Northwestern University, but *felt* drawn to more collaborative, policy-relevant research. The pull of her family *was* also a factor.

But harder evidence of something amiss(a.) *is building*. Granted(ad.), more women *are attaining senior positions* in university economics. But women *make up* only around 30% of PhD students, and *are* likelier than men *to drop away* as they *climb the career ladder*. Among a group of 43 leading American universities, the female share of PhD students *has been essentially flat* for two decades (see chart 1). That of assistant professors *has fallen* since 2009. Progress *seems to have been a little slower* than in some natural sciences, and economics *remains* far behind other social sciences.


*Quantifying* the effects of *such* fuzzy notions *as* behaviour and culture *is* hard. But the American Economics Association (AEA), the leading professional body for academic economists, *has attempted to do* just that. On March 18th the AEA *published the findings of a survey* of its members, *examining* the “professional climate”. The survey *reveals many more data points* than one, and *finds plenty of evidence of* harassment and discrimination.

More than 9,000 economists, or 20% of those eligible, *completed the survey*. Only two-fifths of respondents *reported that* they *felt* “valued within...economics”. But women and non-whites *tended to feel worst*. They *were more likely to report* unfair treatment when *seeking an academic job* and in pay and promotion. Almost half of women *reported* experiencing discrimination based on their sex. Among non-whites of both sexes, 29% *complained of* discrimination *on the basis of* ethnicity.

It is possible that the sample is biased, *pushing up* the apparent frequency of discrimination. The disgruntled *may have been especially keen to* have their say. Against that, the survey *may have struggled* to reach those who *had been [so] discouraged* by their experience [that] they *had left* the profession altogether.

In any case, the survey *yielded* more than enough reports of sexual harassment. Nearly 2,000 respondents *said* they *had been embarrassed or offended by* inappropriate gestures, remarks or materials *from* other economists. Hundreds *reported* experiences of attempted or actual sexual assault by a colleague or student in the past ten years. And 267 *reported that* they *would have been rewarded* [had they *co-operated with* unwanted sexual attention], or *threatened with* retaliation [had they not].

These figures *are* still fairly raw. Later this year the AEA *will release further analysis*, for example *comparing* the results *with* surveys from other academic disciplines. However economics *measures up*, abuses of power *are* probably widespread. A meta-analysis of studies of the prevalence of sexual harassment in 2003 *ranked* academia second *only to* the armed forces.

The Economist *has supplemented* the AEA’s survey by *interviewing* 30 members of the profession, some *speaking* [*on condition of* anonymity], *to understand* where and why problems *exist*. Most *were* women and at highly regarded universities. Most *had* tenure. Most *reported that* their colleagues *were kind* and that they *enjoyed academic life*. But their experiences *varied widely*. And all of them *said that* the profession *had its problems*.

One *reported* receiving too many comments on her appearance. Another *said* a fellow graduate student *had been stalked*. Some *spoke of* a set of senior men who *were* notorious sources of unwanted attention after a few drinks. Others *mentioned* an academic who *had been edged out of a university department* after several complaints against him, *including* some by graduate students, of unwanted sexual advances. He *was then promoted* at a different university.

Our interviewees *found* it much easier *to name* prominent bullies *than* notorious harassers. A senior professor *said that* she *had seen* a special nastiness (*reserved for* people (*regarded as* vulnerable, including women)). Others *claimed* only to have seen “assholes” who *were* indiscriminate in their aggression.

*Uncovering and fixing* such faults *is* difficult. Like any profession, economics *is* hierarchical. *As* in other academic disciplines, success *depends on* peer review. A formal complaint(n.) against someone (higher up the ladder) *invites* retaliation. Your research *may be trashed*. Your chances of promotion *may be blighted*. If the perpetrator *is* at a different university, you *may not even know* who *to complain to*.

The potential for abuse of power *starts early*. There is a growing trend for young economists *to work as* research assistants to leading academics, as a pathway into prestigious PhD programmes. If the academic *refuses to write them* a good reference, their career *may be over* before it *even starts*. PhD students are just as reliant(a.) on their seniors. Success *requires* letters of recommendation, invitations to conferences, help(n.) with research ideas /and perhaps joint research. In all these areas women *were far likelier* to report(v.) unfair treatment than men in the AEA’s survey (see chart 2). Non-whites *were also more likely to report it* than whites.


Unfair treatment *can be* unwitting(a.). Senior professors *may be unconsciously drawn to favour* students who *look like* their younger selves. They *may like* chatting about work over a drink, which young women *may find uncomfortable*. One PhD student *said* she *felt that* female students *found* {it harder *to connect with* male professors}. She *suspected* {that *was partly due to* unspoken worries about harassment}.

On the job market, too, interviewees *detected* implicit bias. One senior woman *recalled* hearing statements such as “Her paper is really good -- she works really hard” *alongside* those like “His paper is OK but he’s super-smart.” Writers of recommendation letters *may not take into account* time off *for* child-rearing. Women *may be held to higher standards* in evaluations of their research. Two recent studies by Erin Hengel of the University of Liverpool *found that* their papers *are more readable* than those written by men /and *cited more often*, *suggesting* a higher hurdle for publication. Heather Sarsons of the University of Toronto *has found that* women *get a smaller boost than men* in their chances of tenure *from* each paper they co-write.

Then *there is* the style of seminars, for which *economics is notorious*. Interruptions and intense questioning *are supposed to weed out errors* and *uncover sloppy thinking*. And several interviewees *told of* supportive sub-fields and departments, where the primary purpose *was not to tear down* the speaker. But one *said* she *felt like quitting* after *seeing* how a female presenter was treated. Another economist *reported* being asked during a presentation whether she knew any economics, and *being interrupted incessantly*.

Even if everyone *gets the same treatment*, minority groups (which in economics *includes women*) *may find* such an environment unpleasant. The PhD students we spoke to *said* they *were put off* by the seminar style. Among macroeconomists, whose field *is both* particularly short of women *and* infamous(a.) for bare-knuckled seminars, 40% of those *responding to* the AEA’s survey *felt* “disrespected”; among female macroeconomists, 70% did.

Change will be slow. Assessments of young economists’ potential *will always be* subjective [to a degree]. Some senior economists *shudder*, with justification, *at the thought of* *sitting through* a sloppy seminar [*in silence*], and *worry that* a cuddlier environment *will soften* intellectual rigour.

But experimentation *is happening*. Some departments *have begun to try* different seminar styles, for example *insisting that* presenters *should be allowed* a minimum time *to speak* before *being interrupted*. Some *have circulated* reminders(n.) that people *should raise a hand* before *asking a question*, or *be mindful of* the time they are taking *as* they make their point.

Ideas *are circulating about* ways *to attract and support* junior and female researchers. The most recent issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives *contained* a collection of papers on the determinants of women’s success in PhD programmes /and ways(n.) *to “make* economics *work for* women at every stage”. One, by Leah Boustan and Andrew Langan of Princeton University, *found that* departments with better outcomes for junior women *also hired* more female faculty members, *provided* “collegial” research seminars and *were more aware of* gender issues.

Another paper by Mr Langan, *covering* accounting, sociology and political science *as well as* economics, *found that* when women *become* department chairs, the female share of graduate students *goes up with* no deterioration in candidates’ quality. Women in those departments *also publish* more papers and *are likelier* to get tenure. The difference *may lie in* female heads of department *sharing out* non-academic duties [more fairly]. Over 40% of the women in the AEA’s survey *reported* being given a disproportionate load.

Young economists *are also speaking out*. Last year the New York Times *reported that* Roland Fryer, a prominent economist at Harvard, *had been found by* the university *to have created* a hostile work environment *for* research assistants in his laboratory, which he *denies*. After Mr Fryer *resigned from* the AEA’s executive committee last December, several hundred research assistants and graduate students from dozens of universities *signed an open letter* in Medium, an online magazine, *pointing out that* bad behaviour *was* “too often an open secret *among* graduate students *and* junior faculty”.

Some *have accused* economists *of* being slow to tackle(v.) discrimination in their profession *because of* their conviction(n.) that market forces *would drive it out*. “It *was more like* benign neglect,” says Ben Bernanke, a former head of the Federal Reserve and the AEA’s president. “Nobody *said* we should prevent women from becoming economists. But there *weren’t* a lot of people *saying* we *should take affirmative steps* to make it more accessible to *a broader range of* people.”

Now the AEA *is taking action*. Mr Bernanke, Olivier Blanchard (his predecessor as president) and Janet Yellen (his successor and another ex-head of the Fed) *announced* several measures with the survey’s findings. The AEA *will pay for* an ombudsman *to hear and record complaints about* harassment and discrimination, and *to provide advice*. Members *will vote on* proposals(n.) *to add teeth to* an expanded code of conduct. Penalties for misbehaviour *include* ejection from the AEA’s activities, termination of membership and a notification to an offender’s employer. Retaliation against anyone (filing a complaint) *can also invite* disciplinary action.

This *amounts to* recognising(v.) that although economists *may like to believe that* their profession is a meritocracy, in which the best *rise to the top*, the reality *is* much murkier. *As things stand*, good work *may be crushed* along with the bad. And change *would*, if nothing else, *make* many economists happier. Ms Nagypál *cannot say* whether she *would have stayed* in a more supportive environment. But she *knows that* “*it* would have been nice *to try*.”
