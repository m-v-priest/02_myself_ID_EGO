“TRUSTING CHINA *is* like trusting pigs can climb trees!” *read*(`=to have sth written on it; to be written in a particular way 写着；写成`) one of the many sardonic(`=showing that you think that you are better than other people and do not take them seriously 轻慢的；轻蔑的；嘲弄的`) placards(`=a large written or printed notice that is put in a public place or carried on a stick in a march 游行时手里举的写有政治口号的牌子, 标语牌；广告牌；招贴；海报`) *held by* protesters.

“相信中国就像相信猪能爬树!” 写在了抗议者举着的许多带有讽刺意味的标语牌上。
====
- read : v.  to have sth written on it; to be written in a particular way 写着；写成 +
-> The sign *read* ‘No admittance’. 告示牌上写着“禁止入内”。

- sardonic => 传说地中海中撒丁岛（sardinia）上有一种毒草，其毒性足以致命。误食者会肌肉抽搐，狂笑不止而死，死的时候脸上依然保持一种古怪的笑容。古希腊诗人荷马将这种笑容称为“撒丁式笑容”，翻译成英语就是sardonic smile，单词sardonic就来自撒丁岛的名字sardinia，现在常常用来表示“冷笑的”、“讥讽的”。
====

Despite a chilly(a.)(`=too cold to be comfortable 寒冷的；阴冷的`) drizzle(`= light fine rain 毛毛细雨`), thousands of Hong Kongers *rallied*(`=*rally : ~ (sb/sth) (around/behind/to sb/sth)* : to come together or bring people together in order to help or support sb/sth 召集；集合`) at the headquarters 总部;总指挥部 of the territory’s(`=land that is under the control of a particular country or ruler 领土；版图；领地; /an area of a town, country, etc. that sb has responsibility for in their work or another activity （某人负责的）地区`) government on March 31st.

3月31日，尽管下着冷雨，成千上万的香港人还是聚集在特区政府总部。许多人高呼口号，谴责香港特首林郑月娥(Carrie Lam)。民主派活动人士发表了振奋人心的演讲。在稍远一点的地方，一群戴着面具的示威者挥舞着要求香港独立的横幅。


The demonstration *was* about a bill that, for the first time since Hong Kong’s return to Chinese rule(`=the government of a country or control of a group of people by a particular person, group or system 统治；管理；支配；控制; 一个国家或一个特定的人、团体或系统对一群人的控制`) in 1997, *would allow* the extradition (罪犯的)引渡;亡命者送还本国 of criminal suspects from the territory to China’s mainland.

====
- extradition => ex-出 + tra-转变,转换 + -dit-给 + -ion名词词尾
====
这次示威是关于一项法案，该法案将允许将犯罪嫌疑人从香港引渡到中国大陆，这是自1997年香港回归中国以来的第一次。

[On April 3rd] a draft *was presented to* Hong Kong’s legislature, which *is* all but(`= *all but* : almost 几乎；差不多`) certain *to approve* it.

By China’s design, pro-establishment(`=*the Establishment* : the people in a society or a profession who have influence and power and who usually do not support change （通常反对变革的）当权派，权势集团；（统称）权威人士`) lawmakers *have* a majority.

====

Under their “one country, two systems” arrangement, Hong Kong and the mainland *are* separate jurisdictions(`= *~ (over sb/sth) /~ (of sb/sth) (to do sth)* : the authority that an official organization has to make legal decisions about sb/sth 司法权；审判权；管辖权; / an area or a country in which a particular system of laws has authority 管辖区域；管辖范围`).

The territory *has concluded*(`=~ sth (with sb) : to arrange and settle an agreement with sb formally and finally 达成，订立，缔结（协定）`) its own extradition 引渡 deals *with* 20 other countries, *including* America, Britain, Canada and Germany.

根据“一国两制”的安排，香港和内地是两个不同的司法管辖区。香港已经与包括美国、英国、加拿大和德国在内的20个国家, 签署了引渡协议。

But Hong Kong’s law on the surrender(`=~ sth/sb (to sb) : ( formal ) to give up sth/sb when you are forced to （被迫）放弃，交出 /投降`) of fugitives(n.)(`=~ (from sb/sth) a person who has escaped or is running away from somewhere and is trying to avoid being caught 逃亡者；逃跑者；亡命者`), which *was passed* [shortly before the handover(n.)(`=the act of moving power or responsibility from one person or group to another; the period during which this is done （权力、责任等的）移交，移交期`)], in effect 事实上, 实际上 *prohibited*(`=to stop sth from being done or used especially by law （尤指以法令）禁止`) the handing over of suspects to the mainland(`=*hand sth over (to sb) /hand over (to sb)*: to give sb else your position of power or the responsibility for sth 把（权力或责任）移交给（某人）;  把某事物╱某人正式交给（某人）`) by *specifying(`=to state sth, especially by giving an exact measurement, time, exact instructions, etc. 具体说明；明确规定；详述；详列`) that* the legislation(`=a law or a set of laws passed by a parliament 法规；法律`) *does not apply to* “any part” (later *amended(`=to change a law, document, statement, etc. slightly in order to correct a mistake or to improve it 修正，修订（法律文件、声明等）`) to* “any other part”) of China.

但在香港回归前不久通过的《香港通缉令》(Hong Kong 's law on the surrender of), 实际上禁止将犯罪嫌疑人移交给内地，规定该法不适用于中国的“任何部分”(后来修改为“任何其他部分”)。
====
- surrender => sur-,在上，向上，render,给回，返还，给予，递交。原指放弃，交出，后引申词义投降，屈 服等，且成为主要词义。词义演变比较 give up.

- fugitive =>  -fug-逃离 + -itive形容词词尾 +

新法案将废除这一排斥的规定。

Johannes 约翰内斯;乔纳斯;葡萄牙18世纪早期制作的金币 Chan of the University of Hong Kong *said* `主` the omission(`= ~ (from sth) the act of not including sb/sth or not doing sth; the fact of not being included/done 省略；删除；免除; /遗漏；疏忽`) of China `谓` *had helped* to reassure(v.)(`=~ sb (about sth) : to say or do sth that makes sb less frightened or worried 使…安心；打消…的疑虑`) countries (*signing* extradition 引渡 deals *with* Hong Kong) *that* people *would not be re-extradited(`=引渡（嫌犯或罪犯）（extradite 的过去式及过去分词）`) to* the mainland.

Countries (that *have done so*) *have been assured that* the new bill *will not be applied retrospectively*(`=intended to take effect from a particular date in the past rather than from the present date 有追溯效力的；溯及既往的; /thinking about or connected with sth that happened in the past 回顾的；涉及以往的`).

====
- retrospective => retro-向后 + -spect-看 + -ive形容词词尾 +
-> *retrospective(a.) legislation* 有追溯效力的立法
====
香港大学(University of Hong Kong)的 Johannes Chan 表示，引渡条约排除中国, 有助于消除已与香港签署引渡协议的那些国家的疑虑，即人们不会被再次引渡到内地。已经这样做(和香港签署引渡条件)的国家已经得到保证，新法案不会有追溯效力。

China *believes that* more than 300 fugitives (通常为避免被警察抓住的) 逃避者 from the mainland *are lying(躺) low*(`=*lie low* : to try not to attract attention to yourself 尽量不引起注意；不露面；不露声色`) in Hong Kong, a former senior Chinese police official(n.)(`=a person who is in a position of authority in a large organization 要员；官员；高级职员`) *recently told* the territory’s public broadcaster, RTHK (=Radio Television Hong Kong).

Most are suspected of economic crimes such as corruption.

中国内地一名前高级警官, 最近对香港公共广播电台 -- 香港电台(RTHK) -- 表示，中国相信有300多名内地逃犯藏在香港。大多数人涉嫌经济犯罪，如腐败。

But some Hong Kongers *worry that* `主` Hong Kong’s government, which often *bows(鞠躬) to*(`=*bow to sth* : to agree unwillingly to do sth because other people want you to 屈从于`) the Communist Party’s demands, `谓` *might use* the bill *to turn over*(`=*turn sb over to sb* : to deliver sb to the control or care of sb else, especially sb in authority 移交，送交（他人看管，尤指当局）`) dissidents(`=a person who strongly disagrees with and criticizes their government, especially in a country where this kind of action is dangerous 持不同政见者`) and other political troublemakers [at the central government’s request].

====
- dissident => dis-, 不，非，使相反。-sid, 坐，词源sit,president. 即分开坐的，引申词义政见不和者。
====
但一些香港人担心，经常屈从于共产党要求的香港政府, 可能会利用该法案，在中央政府的要求下，交出持不同政见者和其他政治麻烦制造者。


Unlike Hong Kong, the mainland *offers* the right *to* a fair trial [only in name(`=a reputation that sb/sth has; the opinion that people have about sb/sth 名誉；名声；名气`)].

The bill *does not cover* political crimes.

Hong Kong *may refuse* an extradition request if a suspect *faces* execution(`=the act of killing sb, especially as a legal punishment 处决`).

But the party 党 *often pursues its enemies* by *accusing them of* non-political offences(`=~ (against sb/sth) an illegal act SYN crime 违法行为；犯罪；罪行`).

与香港不同的是，中国大陆只在名义上提供公平审判的权利。该引渡法案不包括政治犯罪。如果嫌疑人面临处决，香港可以拒绝引渡要求。但共产党经常以非政治罪名来追捕其敌人。

`主` Anxieties about the bill `谓` *have been fuelled*(`=fuel : to increase sth; to make sth stronger 增加；加强；刺激 ;/给（交通工具）加油; 给…提供燃料`) by China’s apparent frustration with the use of Hong Kong as a safe haven(`=a place that is safe and peaceful where people or animals are protected 安全的地方；保护区；避难所`) by those (it *dislikes politically*).

中国政府对那些它在政治上不喜欢的人利用香港作为避风港, 感到明显失望，这加剧了(香港及西方)人们对该引渡法案的担忧。

[In 2017] Xiao Jianhua, `主` a Chinese billionaire 巨富；亿万富翁 with close links to powerful families in China, `谓` *was snatched(`= to take sth quickly and often rudely or roughly 一把抓起；一下夺过`) from Hong Kong* by plainclothes(a.)便衣的（尤指不穿制服的警察）agents and *taken to* the mainland.

2017年，与中国权势家族关系密切的中国亿万富翁肖建华, 被便衣从香港带走，带到内地。


In 2015 five Hong Kong booksellers *mysteriously vanished* （莫名其妙地）突然消失, only *to resurface* 再次浮出，再次露出（水面或地面） on the mainland in custody(n.)(`=the state of being in prison, especially while waiting for trial （尤指在候审时的）拘留，拘押，羁押`).

====
- custody => 来自PIE skeu, 覆盖，遮盖，词源同sky, house, hide. +
-> After the riot, 32 people *were taken into police custody*. 那场暴乱后，有32人被警方拘留。
====

One of them *was abducted*(`=to take sb away illegally, especially using force SYN kidnap 诱拐；劫持；绑架`) from Thailand, another from Hong Kong itself.

Their offence *was* selling(v.) gossipy(a.) (书籍或记录)野史的; 记录轶事的; 随笔闲谈的;/爱说长道短的; 八卦的 books about Chinese leaders.

2015年，五名香港书商神秘失踪，在内地被拘留后又重新露面。其中一人在泰国被绑架，另一人在香港被绑架。他们的过错是出售有关中国领导人的八卦书籍。

`主` One of them, Lam Wing-kee, who *was detained*(`=to keep sb in an official place, such as a police station, a prison or a hospital, and prevent them from leaving 拘留；扣押`) while *crossing* the mainland-Hong Kong border and *released* after months of interrogation 讯问；审问, `系` *was* at the forefront(n.)(`=in or into an important or leading position in a particular group or activity 处于最前列；进入重要地位（或主要地位）`) of the protest against the bill (he *is pictured*, *wearing* a baseball cap).

Mr Lam *says* he *plans to leave Hong Kong* before the bill *is enacted* to avoid *being ensnared*(`=to make sb/sth unable to escape from a difficult situation or from a person who wants to control them 使入陷阱（或圈套、困境）`) by it.

====
- ensnare => en-, 进入，使。snare, 圈套，罗网。
====
其中一个名叫 Lam Wing-kee 的人, 是在穿越中港边境时被拘留的，经过几个月的审讯后获释。Lam Wing-kee 表示，他计划在该法案生效前离开香港，以免落入该法案的圈套。

Perhaps *to avoid* focusing on potentially controversial(a.)(`=causing a lot of angry public discussion and disagreement 引起争论的；有争议的`) extraditions to the mainland, Hong Kong’s government *justifies*(`=justify : to show that sb/sth is right or reasonable 证明…正确（或正当、有理）`) the legal change in a roundabout(a.)(`=not done or said using the shortest, simplest or most direct way possible 迂回的；间接的；兜圈子的`) way.

或许是为了避免将注意力集中在可能引起争议的引渡到大陆的问题上，香港政府用迂回的方式, 来为这项法律变更进行辩护。

[In February last year] a Hong Konger *fled(`=flee`) back to* the territory after allegedly 依其申述；据说，据称 *murdering* his girlfriend in Taiwan.

Officials in Taiwan *want* Hong Kong *to hand him over*(`=*hand sb/sth over (to sb)* : to give sth/sb officially or formally to another person 把某事物╱某人正式交给（某人）`).

But Hong Kong *says* it *is prevented from doing so* by the law’s inapplicability(n.)不适用 to other parts of China.

Hong Kong’s official stance(n.)(`=~ (on sth) the opinions that sb has about sth and expresses publicly （公开表明的）观点，态度，立场`) *is* the same as China’s: that Taiwan *is* part of the People’s Republic.

去年2月，一名香港人在台湾涉嫌谋杀女友后逃回香港。台湾官员希望香港将他移交。但香港表示，由于该引渡法不适用于中国其他地区(涵义就是指香港政府认为台湾是中国的一部分)，它无法这样做。香港的官方立场与中国相同:台湾是中华人民共和国的一部分。

Alvin Yeung 人名, the leader of the pro-democracy Civic Party, *accepts that* there is a strong case for *extraditing* the suspect *to* Taiwan.

But he *says* there *is* no need for a legal revision(`=the act of changing sth, or of examining sth with the intention of changing it 修订，修改（的进行）`) *as big as* the one proposed 被提议的，建议的; `主` the law, he *argues*, `谓` *should merely be tweaked(`=to make slight changes to a machine, system, etc. to improve it 稍稍调整（机器、系统等）; /扭；拧；扯`) to exclude* extraditions to “mainland China.” That *would still allow* suspects *to be sent to* Taiwan.

支持民主的公民党(Civic Party)的领导人杨家诚(Alvin Yeung)承认，将嫌疑人引渡到台湾, 也是有充分理由的。但是他说, 没有必要像香港政府提议那样大动作的来进行法律修订;他认为，这部法律只需要修改一下，把引渡到“中国大陆”的人排除在外. (意思就是说, 将法律修改为, 香港的罪犯可以引渡到台湾, 但不能引渡到大陆. 换句话说, 就是将台湾排除出中国大陆的司法管辖范围之外)。“这仍然允许嫌疑人被送往台湾。

The proposed bill *says that* to be eligible(a.)(`=~ (for sth) /~ (to do sth) : a person who is eligible for sth or to do sth, is able to have or do it because they have the right qualifications, are the right age, etc. 有资格的；合格的；具备条件的`) for extradition, a suspect *must be accused of* committing(v.) *at least* one of 37 offences  违法行为；犯罪；罪行.

They *include* murder, kidnapping and rape. A few *relate to* white-collar crime.

Hong Kong’s government *insists that* adequate(a.)(`=~ (for sth) /~ (to do sth) : enough in quantity, or good enough in quality, for a particular purpose or need 足够的；合格的；合乎需要的`) measures *are* in place 在适当的地方，在恰当的位置 *to guard against* politically motivated 有动机的 extraditions.

====
- adequate =>  ad-来 + -equ-均,等 + -ate形容词词尾 → 与需要的数量相等的 → 刚好够
====
拟议中的法案规定，嫌疑人必须被指控犯有37项罪行中的至少一项，才有被引渡的资格。其中包括谋杀、绑架和强奸。一些与白领犯罪有关。香港政府坚称，已采取适当措施，防范出于政治动机的引渡行为。

Holden Chow 人名, a pro-establishment legislator, *says that* even if the mainland *were* to try to secure(v.)(`=to obtain or achieve sth, especially when this means using a lot of effort （尤指经过努力）获得，取得，实现`) the extradition of a political offender *by accusing* that person *of* a non-political crime, Hong Kong’s courts *would be able to find* the “disguised 假扮的,伪装的 motive” and *refuse* the request.

But Mr Chan, the academic, *says* the burden （义务、责任等的）重担，负担 *is* on the defendant *to prove* political intent(`=what you intend to do SYN intention 意图；意向；目的`), which is hard.

支持当权派的立法会议员霍尔顿•周(Holden Chow)表示，即使内地试图通过指控一名政犯, 犯有非政治性罪行, 来确保将其引渡，香港法院也能够找出其“伪装的动机”，并拒绝这一要求。但学者Mr Chan表示，让被告有责任来证明自己的政治意图，这很难。

After *lobbying by* businessmen, the local government *agreed on* March 26th *that* the bill *would not cover* nine crimes that *are commonly covered by* Hong Kong’s extradition deals(`=an agreement, especially in business, on particular conditions for buying or doing sth 协议；（尤指）交易`).

These *include* tax violations and unlawful use of computers.

经过商界人士的游说，当地政府于3月26日同意，该法案将不包括香港引渡协议通常涵盖的9项罪行, 包括违反税收和非法使用电脑。

The government *also decided that* extraditable offences *should only involve* those punishable(a.)(`= ~ (by/with sth) that can be punished, especially by law 可以惩罚的；可以处罚的；（尤指）应法办的`) by at least three years in prison *instead of* just one.

That was a relief to some Hong Kongers who *feared* being handed over for trivial(a.)(`=not important or serious; not worth considering 不重要的；琐碎的；微不足道的`) reasons.

But many still *worry that* some extraditable offences *are* too sweeping(a.)(`=too general and failing to think about or understand particular examples （过分）笼统的；一概而论的`), such as crimes “*relating to* bribery”.

政府还决定，可引渡的罪行应该只涉及那些可判处至少三年监禁的人，而不是只判处一年监禁的人。这让一些担心被移交的香港人松了一口气。但许多人仍然担心一些可引渡的罪行过于宽泛，比如“与贿赂有关”的罪行。

`主` People in Hong Kong (who *worry about* extraditions to a legal system *[so] lacking* in due(a.)(`= that is suitable or right in the circumstances 适当的；恰当的；合适的`) process) `谓` *have* company(`=a group of people together 在一起的一群人`) elsewhere.

那些香港人 ,他们担心着被引渡到一个如此缺乏正当程序的法律体系中, 他们在其他地方也有同伴。
====
- company : n. a group of people together 在一起的一群人 +
-> She told *the assembled company* what had happened. 她把发生的事告诉了聚会的人。 +
-> It is bad manners *to whisper [in company]* (= in a group of people) . 在众人面前窃窃私语是不礼貌的行为。
====


Only around 40 countries *have ratified*(`=ratify : to make an agreement officially valid by voting for or signing it 正式批准；使正式生效`) extradition treaties(`=treaty的复数 : a formal agreement between two or more countries （国家之间的）条约，协定`) *with* China.

Very few *are* rich democracies (France, Italy, Spain and South Korea are exceptions).

只有大约40个国家批准了与中国的引渡条约。其中很少有富裕的民主国家(法国、意大利、西班牙和韩国是例外)。

China Daily, a mainland government mouthpiece(`=a person, newspaper, etc. that speaks on behalf of another person or group of people 喉舌；代言人；发言人; /（电话的）话筒;/（乐器的）吹口`), *accused* critics 批评家；评论家；评论员 of the bill *of* “scaremongering”(`=If one person or group accuses another person or group of *scaremongering*, they accuse them of deliberately spreading worrying stories to try and frighten people. 散布骇人听闻的消息`) /and *said* the law *would “not be abused*(`=to use power or knowledge unfairly or wrongly 滥用，妄用（权力、所知所闻）`) in any way”.

In a territory where many people *have misgivings(n.)(`=~ about sth/about doing sth : feelings of doubt or anxiety about what might happen, or about whether or not sth is the right thing to do 疑虑；顾虑`) about* Chinese justice(`= the legal system used to punish people who have committed crimes 司法制度；法律制裁；审判; /the fair treatment of people 公平；公正`), *it* will be hard *to instil*(`=~ sth (in/into sb) to gradually make sb feel, think or behave in a particular way over a period of time 逐渐灌输，逐步培养（感受、思想或行为）`) confidence.

中国政府喉舌《中国日报》(China Daily), 指责该法案的批评者是在“危言耸听”，并表示该法案“不会以任何方式被滥用”。但在一个许多人都对中国的公正心存疑虑的地方(指香港)，将很难树立对此的信心。
====
- ratify =>来自 rate,评估，评价，-fy,使。即经过评估的。
- scaremonger => scare,惊吓，恐惧，-monger,贩卖者，词源同 scandalmonger.

- justice : +

== 01. A draft bill would allow Hong Kong to hand suspects to China’s police 纯净版


Could it be used against the Communist Party’s enemies?


Apr 4th 2019 | HONG KONG

“TRUSTING CHINA *is like* trusting pigs can climb trees!” *read* one of the many sardonic placards *held by* protesters. Despite a chilly drizzle, thousands of Hong Kongers *rallied* at the headquarters of the territory’s government on March 31st. Many *chanted* slogans *denouncing* Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive. Pro-democracy activists *delivered* rousing(a.) speeches. A little farther out, a gaggle of masked demonstrators *waved banners* 分词作状语 [*calling for* Hong Kong’s independence].

The demonstration *was* about a bill that, for the first time since Hong Kong’s return to Chinese rule in 1997, *would allow* the extradition of criminal suspects from the territory to China’s mainland. On April 3rd a draft *was presented to* Hong Kong’s legislature, *which is all but certain* to approve it. By China’s design, pro-establishment lawmakers *have a majority*.

Under their “one country, two systems” arrangement, Hong Kong and the mainland *are* separate jurisdictions. The territory has concluded its own extradition deals with 20 other countries, including America, Britain, Canada and Germany. But `主` Hong Kong’s law (on the surrender of fugitives), which was passed [shortly before the handover], `谓` [in effect] *prohibited* the handing over of suspects to the mainland *by specifying that* {the legislation *does not apply to* “any part” (later *amended to* “any other part”) of China}. The new bill *would scrap this exclusion*. Johannes Chan of the University of Hong Kong said `主` the omission of China `谓` *had helped* *to reassure* countries (*signing* extradition deals *with* Hong Kong) *that* {people *would not be re-extradited to* the mainland}. `主` Countries that have done so `谓` *have been assured that* {the new bill *will not be applied retrospectively*}.

China believes that `主` more than 300 fugitives from the mainland `谓` are lying low in Hong Kong, `主` a former senior Chinese police official `谓` recently told the territory’s public broadcaster, RTHK. Most *are suspected of* economic crimes such as corruption. But some Hong Kongers *worry that* `主` Hong Kong’s government, which often *bows to* the Communist Party’s demands, `谓` *might use the bill* to turn over dissidents(n.) and other political troublemakers [at the central government’s request]. Unlike Hong Kong, the mainland *offers* the right *to* a fair trial [only in name]. The bill *does not cover* political crimes. Hong Kong *may refuse an extradition request* if a suspect *faces execution*. But the party *often pursues its enemies* by *accusing them of* non-political offences.

Anxieties about the bill *have been fuelled* by China’s apparent frustration with *the use of* Hong Kong *as* a safe haven(n.) by those (it *dislikes politically*). In 2017 `主` Xiao Jianhua, a Chinese billionaire *with close links to* powerful families in China, `谓` *was snatched from Hong Kong* by plainclothes agents and *taken to* the mainland. In 2015 five Hong Kong booksellers *mysteriously vanished*, only *to resurface* on the mainland in custody. One of them *was abducted from Thailand*, another from Hong Kong itself. Their offence *was* selling gossipy books about Chinese leaders. `主` One of them, Lam Wing-kee, who *was detained* while *crossing* the mainland-Hong Kong border and *released* after months of interrogation, `系` *was* at the forefront of the protest against the bill (he is pictured, wearing a baseball cap). Mr Lam says he plans to leave Hong Kong before the bill *is enacted* to avoid being ensnared(v.) by it.

Perhaps *to avoid* focusing on potentially controversial extraditions to the mainland, Hong Kong’s government *justifies(v.) the legal change [in a roundabout way]*. In February last year a Hong Konger *fled back to the territory* after allegedly *murdering his girlfriend* in Taiwan. Officials in Taiwan *want* Hong Kong *to hand him over*. But Hong Kong *says* it is prevented from doing so by the law’s inapplicability(n.) to other parts of China. Hong Kong’s official stance *is the same as China’s*: that Taiwan is part of the People’s Republic. Alvin Yeung, the leader of the pro-democracy Civic Party, *accepts that* {there is a strong case for *extraditing* the suspect *to* Taiwan}. But he says there is no need for a legal revision as big as the one proposed; the law, he argues, *should merely be tweaked* to exclude(v.) extraditions to “mainland China.” That would still allow suspects to be sent to Taiwan.

The proposed bill *says that* {to be eligible for extradition, a suspect *must be accused of* committing(v.) [at least] one of 37 offences}. They *include* murder, kidnapping and rape. A few *relate to* white-collar crime. Hong Kong’s government *insists that* {adequate measures *are* in place *to guard against* politically motivated extraditions}. Holden Chow, a pro-establishment legislator, says that {even if the mainland *were to try to secure* the extradition of a political offender *by accusing* that person *of* a non-political crime, Hong Kong’s courts would be able to find the “disguised motive” and *refuse the request*}. But Mr Chan, the academic, says {the burden *is* on the defendant *to prove political intent*, which is hard}.

After *lobbying by businessmen*, the local government *agreed on* March 26th *that* {the bill *would not cover* nine crimes that are commonly covered by Hong Kong’s extradition deals}. These include tax violations and unlawful use of computers. The government *also decided that* extraditable offences *should only involve* those punishable(a.) by at least three years in prison *instead of* just one. *That was a relief* to some Hong Kongers who *feared* being handed over for trivial reasons. But many *still worry that* some extraditable offences *are too sweeping*(a.), such as crimes “*relating to* bribery”.

`主` People in Hong Kong *who worry about* extraditions to a legal system *so lacking(v.) in due process* `谓` have company elsewhere. Only around 40 countries *have ratified* extradition treaties *with* China. Very few *are* rich democracies (France, Italy, Spain and South Korea *are* exceptions). China Daily, a mainland government mouthpiece, *accused* critics of the bill *of* “scaremongering” and *said* the law *would “not be abused [in any way]*”. In a territory where many people *have misgivings(n.) about* Chinese justice, *it* will be hard *to instil(v.) confidence*.

Apr 4th 2019 | FORDE AND TLAXCALA

IN AN OLD music classroom in the Culture Palace in Tlaxcala 墨西哥的一个州名, two hours’ drive 驾驶；开车 east of Mexico City, *sits* Alejandra Frausto, Mexico’s culture minister.

She *hopes* her new office’s bare walls *will soon sport*(`=to have or wear sth in a proud way 得意地穿戴；夸示；故意显示`) a screen *for* video-conferencing *with* Mexico City and beyond.

墨西哥文化部长Alejandra Frausto, 坐在特拉斯卡拉文化宫的一间旧音乐教室里。该文化宫距离墨西哥城以东有两小时车程. 她希望她的新办公室光秃秃的墙上, 很快就会出现一个屏幕，用于与墨西哥城及其他城市进行视频会议。
====
- sport : v.  to have or wear sth in a proud way 得意地穿戴；夸示；故意显示 +
=> 缩写自 disport,嬉戏，消遣，玩乐，来自 dis-,离开，-port,承担，担负，词源同 comport,porter. 后词义限定为体育运动。引申比喻义穿戴，炫耀，即抖擞精神。 +
-> *to sport* a beard 故意蓄着大胡子 +
-> She *was sporting* a T-shirt with the company's logo on it. 她穿了一件带有公司徽标的T恤衫，很是得意。
====

Hers *is* one of the first two ministries *to move* under a policy of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, usually *known as* AMLO, *elected* last year.


*Resurrecting*(`=to bring back into use sth, such as a belief, a practice, etc., that had disappeared or been forgotten 重新应用；恢复使用；使复兴`) an idea *first mooted*(`= to suggest an idea for people to discuss SYN propose, SYN put forward 提出…供讨论`) in the 1980s, he *wants to move* a big central-government body *to* each of 30 Mexican states.

====
- "分词"短语是不能用作"目的状语"的，因为"目的状语"是不定式to do的“专属职责”。所以这里的 Resurrecting... 就不是目的状语了. 而是"补充说明"或"伴随"状况, 或者是"原因状"
====

Tlaxcala’s state capital *has* 85,000 people, only eight times *more than* the culture ministry’s staff in Mexico City.

Ms Frausto *dreams(v.) of* one day *having* thousands of workers in the state.

====
- moot => 词源同meet.引申词义大会，讨论会。后作为法学院学生俚语用以指模拟辩论，模拟开庭，并引申讽刺词义无实际意义的。
====
她的部门是在总统AMLO的政策下, 首批采取行动的两个部委之一。AMLO总统于去年当选。为了重振上世纪80年代提出的一个想法，他希望将一个大的中央政府机构, 转移至墨西哥的30个州中的每一个中去。特拉斯卡拉的州首府有8.5万人口，只比墨西哥城文化部的工作人员多8倍。弗劳斯托女士梦想有一天在这个州有成千上万的工人。


Revolutionary [*as* AMLO’s plan *sounds*], it is part of a global trend. Around the world, capital cities *are disgorging*(`=disgorge : to pour sth out in large quantities 大量涌出；倾泄出; /if a vehicle or building disgorges people, they come out of it in large numbers （从交通工具、建筑物里）涌出`) bureaucrats(`= an official working in an organization or a government department, especially one who follows the rules of the department too strictly 官僚主义者；官僚`).

====
- disgorge => dis-, 不，非，使相反。gorge, 喉咙，吞没。
====

In the post-colonial fervour(n.)(`= very strong feelings about sth 热情；热诚；热烈`) of the 20th century, coastal 沿海的；靠近海岸的 capitals *picked by* trade-focused empires *were spurned*(`= to reject or refuse sb/sth, especially in a proud way （尤指傲慢地）拒绝`) for “regionally neutral”(`=not supporting or helping either side in a disagreement, competition, etc. 中立的；持平的；无倾向性的; / 中立者；中立国`) new ones, such as Brasilia (Brazil), Islamabad (Pakistan) and Dodoma (Tanzania); more recently, Kazakhstan *built* Nursultan (née Astana) and Myanmar 缅甸 Naypyidaw.

But decamping(`=~ (from...) (to...) to leave a place suddenly, often secretly 逃亡；潜逃`) wholesale(ad./adj.)(`=happening or done to a very large number of people or things 大规模的`) *is* costly and unpopular; governments these days *prefer* piecemeal(`= done or happening gradually at different times and often in different ways, rather than carefully planned at the beginning 逐渐做成（或发生）的；零敲碎打的；零散的`) dispersal(n.)(`=the process of sending sb/sth in different directions; the process of spreading sth over a wide area 分散；疏散；散布`).

====
- spurn => 唾弃；冷落；一脚踢开. 来自古英语 spurnan,踢开，词源同 spur,马刺，鞭刺。引申比喻义拒绝，回绝。
- Dodoma : 坦桑尼亚中部城市，新首都
- piecemeal => piece,一块，一片，meal,此处来自其古义分配时间，指定时间。引申词义零碎的。
====
在20世纪的后殖民热潮中，以贸易为中心的帝国, 曾选择沿海城市为首都, 但这种趋势正则被摒弃，取而代之的是以“区域中立”的新首都，如巴西利亚(巴西)、伊斯兰堡(巴基斯坦)和多多马(坦桑尼亚); 最近，哈萨克斯坦建造了努尔苏丹(nee Astana), 缅甸建造了内比都(Naypyidaw)。但是，大规模地搬迁成本高昂，而且不受欢迎;如今的政府更倾向于零星地来分散政府功能。

Take Norway, which since 2006 *has shifted*(`=to move, or move sth, from one position or place to another 转移；挪动`) 1,600 civil-service jobs *out of* Oslo 挪威首都.

The competition 竞争；角逐 authority 竞争监管机构;公平竞争委员会 is in Bergen 挪威城市名, the second city.

The polar institute *was packed off(`=pack sb off (to...) :  to send sb somewhere, especially because you do not want them with you 把…打发走`) to a town* not far short of the North Pole.

And [last year] the Norwegian peace corps(`=*Peace Corps* : a US organization that sends young Americans to work in other countries without pay in order to create international friendship 和平队， 和平工作团 （美国机构，送美国青年去其他国家义务工作以建立国际友谊）`), Norec, an agency that *oversees*  监督；监视 programmes in 25 poorer countries, *moved to* Forde, a settlement （尤指拓荒安家的）定居点 of 13,000 people *nestled*(`=to be located in a position that is protected, sheltered or partly hidden 位处，坐落（于安全、隐蔽之处）;/to sit or lie down in a warm or soft place 依偎；舒适地坐（或卧）`) between mountains, rivers and fjords(`=a long narrow strip of sea between high cliffs , especially in Norway （尤指挪威两岸峭壁间的）峡湾`).

====
- fjord => 来自挪威语。来自PIE per, 向前，穿过，语源同ford, firth.
====
以挪威为例，自2006年以来，该国已将1600个公务员岗位迁出奥斯陆。竞争管理机构设在卑尔根，第二大城市。极地研究所被派往离北极不远的一个小镇。去年，挪威和平队(Norec)——一个负责监督25个较贫穷国家的项目的机构——搬到了福德(Forde)，这是一个坐落在群山、河流和峡湾之间的有13000人的定居点。

Mexico and Norway *are* just two of many.

South Korea *has moved* two-thirds of its government agencies *away* from Seoul, many of them *to* the newly built Sejong 世宗 City.

Since 2015 Denmark *has moved* thousands of government jobs *to* scores(`=a set or group of 20 or approximately 20 20个；约20个; / very many 大量；很多`) of cities.

Malaysia *shifted* many of its paper-pushers(`=a person who does unimportant office work as their job 办公室小职员；小文书`) in 1999 *from* Kuala Lumpur *to* a new city called Putrajaya.

Indonesia *is mulling*(`=*MULL STH OVER* : to spend time thinking carefully about a plan or proposal 认真琢磨，反复思考（计划、建议等）`) moving(v.) its capital from Jakarta.

====
- mull => 来自中古英语mullyn,磨粉，来自PIE*mel,磨，锤打，词源同mill,mallet.引申词义认真琢磨， 反复思考。
====
墨西哥和挪威只是众多国家中的两个。韩国已经将三分之二的政府机构迁离首尔，其中许多迁到了新建的世宗市。自2015年以来，丹麦已将数千个政府工作岗位转移到数十个城市。1999年，马来西亚将许多办公文员从吉隆坡转移到一个名为布城的新城市。印度尼西亚正在考虑将首都从雅加达迁出。


The trend *reflects* how the world *has changed*.

In past eras, when information *travelled* [at a snail’s 蜗牛 pace], civil servants *had to cluster(`=~ (together) to come together in a small group or groups 群聚；聚集) together*.

But now desk-workers *can ping*(`=to send an email or text message to sb 发送（电子邮件、手机短信）;/ping命令, 就是用来测试是否连通互联网的`) emails and video-chat around the world.

Travel for face-to-face meetings *may be* unavoidable, but transport links, too, *have improved*.

Forde, Norec’s new base, *is* 400km from Oslo but *offers* five hour-long 一小时长的 flights to the capital a day.

这一趋势反映了世界的变化。在过去，信息传播速度慢如蜗牛，公务员们不得不挤在一起。但现在，办公人员可以在世界各地发送电子邮件和进行视频聊天。面对面会议的旅行可能是不可避免的，但交通联系也得到了改善。Norec的新基地Forde, 距奥斯陆400公里，但每天提供5小时的飞往首都的航班。

`主` Proponents(`=a person who supports an idea or course of action 倡导者；支持者；拥护者`) of *moving* civil servants around `谓` *promise* countless benefits.

====
- proponent => pro-,向前，-pon,放置，词源同position,postpone.引申词义支持者，拥护者。
====

It *disperses*(`=to move apart and go away in different directions; to make sb/sth do this （使）分散，散开；疏散；驱散`) the risk that a terrorist attack or natural disaster *will cripple*(`=to seriously damage or harm sb/sth 严重毁坏（或损害）;/使残废；使跛；使成瘸子`) an entire government.

Wonks 一味苦干的人；书呆子 in the sticks(`=*the sticks* [ pl. ] ( informal ) country areas, a long way from cities 边远乡村地区`) *will be inspired(`= to give sb the idea for sth, especially sth artistic or that shows imagination 赋予灵感；引起联想；启发思考`) by* new ideas that walled-off(`=to separate one place or area from another with a wall 用墙把…隔开`) capitals *cannot conjure(`=to do clever tricks such as making things seem to appear or disappear as if by magic 变魔术；变戏法；使…变戏法般地出现（或消失）`) up*(`=*CONJURE STH UP* : to make sth appear as a picture in your mind 使…呈现于脑际；使想起`).

====
- conjure => con-, 强调。-jur, 发誓，念咒，词源同abjure, jurist.
====
支持对公务员做调动的人, 承诺说, 这将带来数不尽的好处。它分散了恐怖袭击或自然灾害使整个政府瘫痪的风险。住在乡下的书呆子们也会受到新思想的启发，而这些新思想是被隔离的首都所无法带给人的。

Autonomous 自治的；有自治权的 regulators 监管人; 监管机构 *perform(v.) best* far from the pressure and lobbying of the big city.

Some *even hail*(`=to describe sb/sth as being very good or special, especially in newspapers, etc. 赞扬（或称颂）…为…（尤用于报章等）`) a cure(`=~ (for sth) something that will solve a problem, improve a bad situation, etc. （解决问题、改善糟糕情况等的）措施，对策; /药；药物；疗法`) for ascendant(`=being or becoming more powerful or popular （权力、影响等）越来越大；日益受欢迎`) cynicism(`=the belief that people always act selfishly. 人皆自私论; 愤世嫉俗论;犬儒主义`) and populism(`=a type of politics that claims to represent the opinions and wishes of ordinary people 平民政治；民粹主义；民意论`).

The unloved bureaucrats of faraway capitals *will become* as popular as firefighters once they *mix with* regular(`=ordinary; without any special or extra features 普通的；平凡的`) folk.

拥有自治权的监管者, 在远离大城市的压力和游说的情况下表现最好。一些人甚至为正在崛起的犬儒主义和民粹主义欢呼。遥远首都的那些不受欢迎的官僚们一旦与普通民众打成一片，就会变得像消防员一样受欢迎。


Beyond these sunny(`=cheerful and happy 欢乐的；快乐的;/with a lot of bright light from the sun 阳光充足的`) visions, `主` *dispersing* 使分散; 扩散 central-government functions `谓` *usually has* three specific aims: *to improve* the lives of both civil servants and those living in clogged 阻塞的；堵住的 capitals; *to save money*; and *to redress*(`=to correct sth that is unfair or wrong 纠正；矫正；改正`) regional imbalances(`=*redress the ˈbalance* : to make a situation equal or fair again 恢复公平合理的情况；恢复平衡`).

*The trouble is that* these goals *are not always realised* 实现.

====
- redress => re-,再，重新，-dress,拉直，引导，词源同 direct,address,right.
====
除了这些美好的愿景，分散中央政府的职能, 通常有三个具体的目标: 1.改善公务员和那些住在拥堵的首都中的人的生活; 2.为了省钱; 3.并纠正地区失衡。问题是，这些目标并不总是能够实现。


The first aim -- *improving* living conditions -- *has* a long pedigree(`=a person's family history or the background of sth, especially when this is impressive 家谱；门第；世系；起源;/ 动物血统记录；动物纯种系谱`).

====
- pedigree => *词根ped指“脚”，它和单词foot（脚）同源；-gree和单词crane（鹤）同源*，体会其中涉及的g、c音变，再如：act（行动）—agent（代理人），section（部分）—segment（部分；段）；字面义“鹤足”，*家谱的脉络形状像鹤的脚一样，咱们称其“树状图”。*
====

[After the second world war] Britain *moved* thousands of civil servants *to* “agreeable(`=pleasant and easy to like 愉悦的；讨人喜欢的；宜人的`) English country towns” [as London was rebuilt].

But `主` *swapping*(`=*~ sb/sth (for sb/sth) /~ sb/sth (over)* : ( especially BrE ) to replace one person or thing with another 用…替换；把…换成；掉换`) the capital *for* somewhere smaller `系` *is not* always agreeable.

Attrition(`=a process of making sb/sth, especially your enemy, weaker by repeatedly attacking them or creating problems for them （尤指给敌人造成的）削弱，消耗;人员流失`) rates *can exceed* 80%.

Even the footloose(a.)(`=free to go where you like or do what you want because you have no responsibilities 行动无拘无束的；自由自在的`) youngsters(`=a young person or a child 年轻人；少年；儿童`) Norec *tends to employ(`=to use sth such as a skill, method, etc. for a particular purpose 应用；运用；使用`) bridled*(`= to put a bridle on a horse 给（马）套笼头`).

第一个目标——改善生活条件—— 该目标其实由来已久。第二次世界大战后，伦敦重建时，英国把成千上万的公务员迁往“令人愉快的英国乡村小镇”。但是，将首都转移到更小的地方, 并不总是令人愉快的。雇员流失率可以超过80%。即使是对于自由自在的年轻人, Norec地方的管理者, 也倾向于约束他们的离职。
====
- attrition => 前缀at-同ad-. *-tri,同turn, 转，磨。* attuned 适应的 前缀at-同ad-. tune, 曲调。指舞曲一致。

- employ : v. *to use sth such as a skill, method, etc. for a particular purpose* 应用；运用；使用 +
-> He criticized the repressive(a.) methods *employed by the country's government*. 他指责了这个国家政府采取的镇压手段。
-> The police had to *employ force* to enter the building. 警察不得不强行进入大楼。
====

One, Magnhild Bogseth, *recalls* 记起；回忆起；回想起: “When I *moved to* Paraguay or Nicaragua, my friends *never asked*: ‘*Are you sure* you want to do this?’ But when I *came to* Forde, they all said: ‘*Will you really be happy* there? Your social life *will be destroyed*!’” Many locals 当地居民 *also struggle to adjust*.

麦格希尔德•博格塞思(Magnhild Bogseth)回忆道:“当我搬到巴拉圭或尼加拉瓜时，我的朋友从来不会问我:‘你确定你想做这个吗? 但当我去福德时，他们都会说:‘你在那儿真的会感到快乐吗? 你的社交生活将被摧毁!’” 其实, 许多当地人也在努力适应(外地人的到来)。

When a Norec worker *convinced* 说服，劝说（某人做某事） her Colombian boyfriend *to move with her* from Oslo, the town newspaper *reported* his arrival on its front page.

当Norec的一名员工, 说服她的哥伦比亚男友, 和她一起从奥斯陆搬来时，当地报纸在头版报道了他的到来。

As for those (*left* living in the capital), a review(`= an examination of sth, with the intention of changing it if necessary 评审，审查，检查，检讨（以进行必要的修改）;/ a report on a subject or on a series of events 报告；汇报；述评；回顾`) in 1962 in Britain *urged* further dispersal 分散；疏散；散布 *to improve* their “health and welfare.

至于那些留在伦敦的人，1962年英国的一份审查报告, 敦促进一步疏散，以改善他们的“健康和福利”。
====
- review : n. /v. +
-> The case *is subject to judicial review*(`=an examination of sth, with the intention of changing it if necessary 评审，审查，检查，检讨（以进行必要的修改）`) . 这个案子必须接受司法审查。 +
-> a review(`=a report on a subject or on a series of events 报告；汇报；述评；回顾`) of customer complaints 有关消费者投诉的汇报
====

Similarly, the Netherlands *pointed to* congestion(n.)(`=（交通）拥塞；塞车`) and a housing shortage [when *moving government jobs* in the late 1960s].

Egypt’s generals *cite*(`=~ sth (as sth) to mention sth as a reason or an example, or in order to support what you are saying 提及（原因）；举出（示例）；列举`) congestion and pollution in Cairo *to justify*(`=to show that sb/sth is right or reasonable 证明…正确（或正当、有理）`) building(v.) a new, still unnamed capital in the desert.

同样，荷兰在20世纪60年代末转移政府工作岗位时，也提到了交通拥堵和住房短缺。埃及的将军们以开罗的拥堵和污染为理由，证明在沙漠中建造一个新的、仍未命名的首都是合理的。


`主` The second reason *to pack* bureaucrats *off*(`=*pack sb off (to...)* : to send sb somewhere, especially because you do not want them with you 把…打发走`) `系` *is* to save money.

Office space *costs far more* in capitals.

[When London’s property market *stagnated*(`=to stop developing or making progress 停滞；不发展；不进步; /因不流动而变得污浊`) in the late 1970s] the government *lost enthusiasm for* relocation.

`主` Agencies that *are moved elsewhere* `谓` *can often recruit* 吸收（新成员）；征募（新兵） better workers on lower salaries than in capitals, where well-paying multinationals *mop(v.)拖把；墩布 up*(`=*mop sth/sb up* : to remove the liquid from sth using sth that absorbs it 吸干净；吸去…的水分`) talent 有才能的人；人才；天才.

让官僚们搬离老首都的第二个原因, 是为了省钱。在首都，办公空间的成本要高得多。上世纪70年代末，伦敦房地产市场陷入停滞，政府失去了搬迁的热情。搬到其他地方的机构, 通常可以用比在首都更低的薪水来招聘到更好的员工，而在首都，能提供高薪的跨国公司, 会挖走人才(即政府能提供的薪资比不过跨国公司, 也就招不到人才)。

Balancing act

`系` The third reason to shift `系` *is* to rebalance(v.) regional inequality.

[In Mexico] AMLO 墨西哥新总统的名字 *laments*(`=to feel or express great sadness or disappointment about sb/sth 对…感到悲痛；痛惜；对…表示失望`) the “tragedy”(`=a very sad event or situation, especially one that involves death 悲惨的事；不幸；灾难；惨案`) of those who *have to move to* big cities *to make a living*.

The day (the culture ministry *opened* in Tlaxcala), 70 locals *turned up*(`=to arrive 到达；来到；露面`) with their CVs(`=*curriculum vitae* 履历，简历`).

将公务员搬出首都的的第三个目的, 是重新平衡地区之间的不平等。在墨西哥，总统AMLO为那些不得不搬到大城市以寻求工作机会讨生活的人的“悲剧”, 感到悲哀。文化部在特拉斯卡拉开业的那天，就有70名当地人带着他们的简历出现了。


When Britain *moved* 20% of London’s civil servants between 2003 and 2010, it *often picked* areas with high unemployment, such as Newport, a Welsh city *hit by* industrial decline that now *houses*(`=to provide a place for sb to live 给（某人）提供住处; /to be the place where sth is kept or where sth operates from 是（某物）的贮藏处（或安置处）；收藏；安置`) the headquarters of the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

Norway *treats* federal jobs *as* a resource every region *deserves to enjoy*, like profits from oil.

2003年至2010年间，当英国将伦敦20%的公务员迁出时，它经常选择那些失业率高的地区，比如威尔士的纽波特市，该市曾遭受工业衰退的打击，现在则是国家统计局(ONS)的总部所在地。挪威将联邦政府的工作视为是每个地区都应该享有的资源，就像石油带来的利润一样。
====
- house : v. +
-> The government is committed *to housing(v.)(`=to provide a place for sb to live 给（某人）提供住处`) the refugees*. 政府承诺收容难民。 +
-> The gallery *houses*(v.)(`=to be the place where sth is kept or where sth operates from 是（某物）的贮藏处（或安置处）；收藏；安置`) 2000 works of modern art. 美术馆收藏了2000件现代艺术作品。
====

Where government jobs *go*, private ones *follow*.

`主` A study of Berlin after Germany’s federal workforce(`=all the people who work for a particular company, organization, etc. 全体员工`) *was moved from Bonn* in 1999 `谓` *found that* the arrival of 100 government jobs in an area *helped create* 55 private-sector jobs.

`主` A review(`=an examination of sth, with the intention of changing it if necessary 评审，审查，检查，检讨（以进行必要的修改）`) of Britain’s relocations 重新安置 in the 2000s `谓` *found* the same ratio 比率；比例.

The jobs (created) *tend to be* in services, often the law or consultancy 咨询公司.

哪里有政府的工作，哪里就有私人的工作随之而来。1999年, 德国联邦员工们从波恩转移到柏林后，一项对柏林的研究就发现，一个地区100个政府工作岗位的到来, 会帮助私营部门创造出55个工作岗位。一项对21世纪头10年英国迁徙情况的回顾，也发现了同样的比例。创造的就业机会往往在服务业，通常是法律或咨询行业。

[Sometimes] the aim *is* to fulfil(v.)(`=to do or achieve what was hoped for or expected 实现`) the potential of a country’s second-tier 阶层；等级 cities.

有时，这样做的目的是为了发挥一个国家二线城市的潜力。
====
- tier : n. +
-> a wedding cake *with three tiers*(`=a row or layer of sth that has several rows or layers placed one above the other 级；阶；层`). 三层的结婚蛋糕 +
-> We have introduced *an extra tier(`=one of several levels in an organization or a system 阶层；等级`) of administration*. 我们额外增加了一层管理。
====

Unlike poor, remote places, bigger cities *can make* the most of relocated government agencies, *linking* them *to* local universities and businesses and *supplying* a better-educated workforce.

`主` The decision in 1946 *to set up* America’s Centres for Disease Control in Atlanta *rather than* Washington, DC, `谓` *has transformed* the city *into* a hub for health-sector research and business.

与贫穷、偏远的地方不同，大城市可以最大程度地利用搬迁后的政府机构，将它们与当地的大学和企业联系起来，并提供受过更好教育的劳动力。1946年，美国决定在亚特兰大而不是华盛顿特区, 来建立疾病控制中心，这一决定将亚特兰大转变成了一个医疗研究和商业中心。

The dilemma （进退两难的）窘境，困境 *is* obvious.

`主` *Pick* small, poor towns, and areas of high unemployment `谓` *get* new jobs, but *it* is hard *to attract* the most qualified workers;

`主` *opt for*(`=*opt (for/against sth)* : to choose to take or not to take a particular course of action 选择；挑选`) larger cities with infrastructure and better-qualified residents, and(`=as a result （表示结果）结果是；那么；就`) the country’s most deprived(a.)(`=without enough food, education, and all the things that are necessary for people to live a happy and comfortable life 贫穷的；贫困的；穷苦的`) areas `谓` *see* little benefit.

====
- deprive => de-, 夺去，损毁。-priv, 自己的，私人的，词源同private, property.
====
这种两难境地是显而易见的。选择小的，贫穷的城镇，和高失业率的地区, 作为搬迁目的地, 能够为这些地方创造出新的工作岗位，但是却很难吸引最合格的员工; 而选择那些有基础设施和更合格居民的大城市为政府搬迁地，则会使国家中最贫困的地区几乎看不到什么受益。

Whatever the motives, relocations *are* difficult. Norec’s move to Forde *prompted*(`=to make sb decide to do sth; to cause sth to happen 促使；导致；激起`) 34 of its 42 staff *to resign*  辞职 -- and that 20% stayed *was*, *boasts*(`=to talk with too much pride about sth that you have or can do 自夸；自吹自擂`) its director, a record high for Norway.

When the civil-aviation authority 民用航空管理局 *moved to* the Arctic 北极的 Circle, almost all its flight inspectors(`=a person whose job is to visit schools, factories, etc. to check that rules are being obeyed and that standards are acceptable 检查员；视察员；巡视员; /（英国公共汽车或火车上的）查票员`) *quit*. The loss of expertise *took years to replace*.

Similarly, Denmark’s 465-strong environmental protection agency(`=环境保护署（略作EPA）`) *is moving from* Copenhagen *to* Odense, Denmark’s third city. Of its 16 toxicologists 毒理学家, 12 *intend to resign*.

无论动机如何，搬迁都是困难的。Norec搬到Forde后，42名员工中有34人辞职，而留下来的20%，董事夸耀说创下了挪威的最高纪录。当民用航空局进驻北极圈后，几乎所有的飞行检查员都辞职了。而专业技能的流失需要数年时间才能弥补。同样，丹麦的拥有465名成员的环境保护机构, 从哥本哈根迁往丹麦第三大城市欧登塞。在该公司的16名毒理学家中，有12名打算辞职。


Staff disgruntlement 不满;使不高兴 *is not* the only problem.

Forde *scored(`=to gain marks in a test or an exam （在考试中）得分`) worst* on a three-town shortlist  入围名单 for *hosting* Norec.

A local politician *is credited(`=~ A with B /~ B to A : to believe or say that sb is responsible for doing sth, especially sth good 认为是…的功劳；把…归于; /（给银行账户）存入金额；把…记入贷方`) with* swaying(v.)(`=to move slowly from side to side; to move sth in this way （使）摇摆，摇动`) the final call(`=a decision 决定; /a decision made by the umpire （裁判员的）判决`).

员工的不满并不是唯一的问题。地点的选择通常是出于政治原因。Forde在三镇候选名单上, 被评分为最差。但还是选择这个地方, 是源于一位当地政客被认为左右了最后的决定。

[In 2016] Australia’s then deputy(n.)副手；副职；代理 prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, *helped* *move* the pesticides 杀虫剂 and veterinary 兽医的 authority *to* a town in his own constituency(`=a district that elects its own representative to parliament （选举议会议员的）选区`).

另一些人则认为，权力下放会让政府机构变得不那么负责任，从而滋生腐败。埃及的新首都将远离开罗的居民，2011年开罗的抗议推翻了独裁者。美国的一项研究发现，当州首府被孤立时，州政府的腐败情况会更严重—— 常常住在于大城市的记者们，对当权者的警惕也会降低。

但抵抗可能是强大的，搬迁计划往往会流产。工人和工会会反对他们。部长们会为短期内的混乱和不受欢迎而付出代价，但却很少能从更大程度的地区平等中获益(前人栽树, 后人乘凉. 前人背骂名, 后人采摘胜利果子)。2014年，日本首相安倍晋三(Shinzo Abe)提出了一项搬迁计划，以腾出东京的空间, 这一提议遭到了一致反对。

== 02. Why governments move civil servants out of national capitals 纯净版


They want to *unclog(v.) cities*, *save money* and *smooth regional inequality*


Apr 4th 2019 | FORDE AND TLAXCALA

IN AN OLD music classroom in the Culture Palace in Tlaxcala, two hours’ drive east of Mexico City, *sits* Alejandra Frausto, Mexico’s culture minister. She *hopes* her new office’s bare walls *will soon sport(v.) a screen* for video-conferencing with Mexico City and beyond. Hers is one of the first two ministries to move [under a policy of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, usually known as AMLO, *elected* last year]. 伴随状或原因状 *Resurrecting* an idea (first *mooted* in the 1980s), he *wants to move* a big central-government body *to* each of 30 Mexican states. Tlaxcala’s state capital has 85,000 people, only eight times more than the culture ministry’s staff in Mexico City. Ms Frausto *dreams(v.) of* one day *having* thousands of workers in the state.

Revolutionary as AMLO’s plan sounds, it is part of a global trend. Around the world, capital cities *are disgorging* bureaucrats.

In the post-colonial fervour of the 20th century, `主` coastal capitals (*picked by* trade-focused empires) `谓` *were spurned* for “regionally neutral” new ones, such as Brasilia (Brazil), Islamabad (Pakistan) and Dodoma (Tanzania); more recently, Kazakhstan *built* Nursultan (née Astana) and Myanmar Naypyidaw. But decamping wholesale *is* costly and unpopular; governments these days *prefer* piecemeal dispersal(n.).

Take Norway, which since 2006 *has shifted* 1,600 civil-service jobs *out of* Oslo. The competition authority is in Bergen, the second city. The polar institute *was packed off to a town* not far short of the North Pole. And last year `主` the Norwegian peace corps, Norec, an agency that *oversees* programmes in 25 poorer countries, `谓` *moved to* Forde, a settlement of 13,000 people *nestled* between mountains, rivers and fjords.

Mexico and Norway *are* just two of many. South Korea *has moved* two-thirds of its government agencies *away* from Seoul, many of them *to* the newly built Sejong City. Since 2015 Denmark *has moved* thousands of government jobs *to* scores of cities. Malaysia *shifted* many of its paper-pushers in 1999 from Kuala Lumpur *to* a new city called Putrajaya. Indonesia *is mulling* moving(v.) its capital from Jakarta.

The trend *reflects* how the world has changed. In past eras, when information *travelled at a snail’s pace*, civil servants *had to cluster together*. But now desk-workers *can ping* emails and video-chat around the world. Travel for face-to-face meetings *may be unavoidable*, but transport links, too, *have improved*. Forde, Norec’s new base, is 400km from Oslo but *offers* five hour-long flights *to* the capital a day.

`主` Proponents of moving civil servants around `谓` *promise* countless benefits. It *disperses the risk* that a terrorist attack or natural disaster *will cripple* an entire government. Wonks in the sticks *will be inspired by* new ideas that walled-off capitals *cannot conjure up*. Autonomous regulators *perform best* far from the pressure and lobbying of the big city. Some *even hail* a cure for ascendant cynicism and populism. The unloved bureaucrats of faraway capitals *will become as popular as firefighters* once they *mix with* regular folk.

Beyond these sunny visions, `主` *dispersing* central-government functions `谓` *usually has* three specific aims: *to improve* the lives of both civil servants and those *living in* clogged capitals; *to save money*; and *to redress regional imbalances*. *The trouble is that* these goals are not always realised.

The first aim -- *improving* living conditions -- *has* a long pedigree. [After the second world war] Britain *moved* thousands of civil servants *to* “agreeable English country towns” [as London was rebuilt]. But swapping the capital for somewhere smaller *is not* always agreeable. Attrition rates *can exceed* 80%. Even the footloose youngsters Norec *tends to employ bridled*. One, Magnhild Bogseth, *recalls*: “When I *moved to* Paraguay or Nicaragua, my friends never asked: ‘Are you sure you want to do this?’ But when I came to Forde, they all said: ‘Will you really be happy there? Your social life will be destroyed!’” Many locals also *struggle to adjust*. When a Norec worker *convinced* her Colombian boyfriend to move with her from Oslo, the town newspaper *reported* his arrival on its front page.

As for those *left* living in the capital, `主` a review in 1962 in Britain `谓` *urged* further dispersal to improve their “health and welfare. Similarly, the Netherlands *pointed to* congestion and a housing shortage when *moving government jobs* in the late 1960s. Egypt’s generals *cite* congestion and pollution in Cairo *to justify* building a new, still unnamed capital in the desert.

`主` The second reason *to pack* bureaucrats *off* `系` *is* to save money. Office space *costs* far more in capitals. [When London’s property market *stagnated* in the late 1970s] the government *lost enthusiasm* for relocation. `主` Agencies that are moved elsewhere `谓` *can often recruit* better workers on lower salaries than in capitals, where well-paying multinationals *mop up* talent.

Balancing act
The third reason to shift *is* to rebalance regional inequality. [In Mexico] AMLO *laments*(v.) the “tragedy” of those who *have to move to big cities* to make a living. The day the culture ministry *opened* in Tlaxcala, 70 locals *turned up* with their CVs. When Britain moved 20% of London’s civil servants between 2003 and 2010, it often *picked areas* with high unemployment, such as Newport, a Welsh city *hit by industrial decline* that now *houses*(v.) the headquarters of the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Norway *treats* federal jobs *as* a resource (every region *deserves to enjoy*), like profits from oil.

Where government jobs *go*, private ones *follow*. `主` A study of Berlin after Germany’s federal workforce *was moved from Bonn* in 1999 `谓` *found that* the arrival of 100 government jobs in an area *helped create* 55 private-sector jobs. A review of Britain’s relocations in the 2000s *found* the same ratio. The jobs (created) *tend to be* in services, often the law or consultancy.

Sometimes the aim *is* to fulfil the potential of a country’s second-tier cities. Unlike poor, remote places, bigger cities *can make* the most of relocated government agencies, *linking* them *to* local universities and businesses and *supplying* a better-educated workforce. `主` The decision in 1946 *to set up* America’s Centres for Disease Control in Atlanta rather than Washington, DC, `谓` *has transformed* the city *into* a hub for health-sector research and business.

The dilemma is obvious. `主` *Pick* small, poor towns, and areas of high unemployment `谓` *get* new jobs, but *it* is hard *to attract* the most qualified workers; *opt for* larger cities with infrastructure and better-qualified residents, and the country’s most deprived areas *see* little benefit.

Whatever the motives, relocations *are* difficult. `主` Norec’s move to Forde `谓` *prompted* 34 of its 42 staff *to resign* -- and that 20% stayed *was*, *boasts* its director, a record high for Norway. When the civil-aviation authority *moved to* the Arctic Circle, almost all its flight inspectors *quit*. The loss of expertise *took years to replace*. Similarly, Denmark’s 465-strong environmental protection agency *is moving* from Copenhagen to Odense, Denmark’s third city. Of its 16 toxicologists, 12 *intend to resign*.

Staff disgruntlement *is not* the only problem. Places *are often chosen* for political reasons. Forde *scored worst* on a three-town shortlist for *hosting* Norec. A local politician *is credited with* swaying(v.) the final call. In 2016 Australia’s then deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, *helped move* the pesticides and veterinary authority *to* a town in his own constituency. `主` More brazen(a.) still `系` *was* Augusto Pinochet’s displacement of Chile’s congress from Santiago to his hometown of Valparaíso, where it *remains*.

Others *contend that* {decentralisation *begets corruption* by making government agencies less accountable}. Egypt’s new capital *will be* far from the residents of Cairo, whose protests *overthrew* a dictator in 2011. A study in America *found that* state-government corruption *is worse* when the state capital *is isolated* -- journalists, who *tend to live in* the bigger cities, *become less watchful of* those in power.


But resistance *can be formidable* and relocation plans *are often aborted*. Workers and unions *oppose* them. Ministers *incur* the short-term costs of disruption and unpopularity but *rarely reap* the benefits of greater regional equality. In Japan in 2014 Shinzo Abe, the prime minister, *proposed* a relocation drive *to free up space* in Tokyo, which *has faced concerted opposition*.

*Stuck in* the swamp

`主` Washington, DC, a town *designed as* a humble alternative to bigger cities that *has since become* America’s sixth-largest economic area, `系` *is* another stage for this battle. Two cabinet secretaries, Ryan Zinke at Interior (who *resigned* in December) and Sonny Perdue at Agriculture, *proposed* moving(v.) agencies from the capital. Mr Zinke *eventually backed down*. Mr Perdue, who *did not*, *faces* acrimony from his own staff. `主` Three bills that *order* the moving of agencies from the capital `谓` *are stuck in* congressional committees.

Norway once *saw* similar lethargy. `主` Piecemeal proposals *floated* in the 1970s `谓` *were never implemented*. But in the early 2000s politicians, *hoping for* new jobs in their own backyard, *all mobilised*(v.) behind a single policy, says Rune Dahl Fitjar of the University of Stavanger. The government *hid its plans from* public-sector unions, who *had little time to oppose(v.) it* and no right *to strike against it*, says John Leirvaag, a union leader. Most vital *was* political leadership -- a prime minister *determined to make it happen*.

In Mexico AMLO *should [in theory] find* decentralisation less arduous. He *was elected* with a huge mandate on a promise *to fix* the country’s regional disparities, the widest in the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries. But `主` his dream of moving all or even most government workers `系` *is* a long way off, if it is even *to happen at all*. Unlike their Norwegian counterparts, Mexican bureaucrats *have no obligation* to leave the capital. `主` A promise *to move* several offices on his first day `谓` *was dropped*.

The ministers *will show up* once a week. “We *cannot stop* having a base in the capital,” says Victor Manuel Villalobos, whose agriculture ministry *opened an office* in Sonora, in Mexico’s north, last month.

Tlaxcala *offers a reasonably reassuring precedent*. Life there *is* quiet. In 2017 journalists *sardonically reported* the installation of the state’s first escalator. But it *also lacks* the capital’s traffic, pollution and violence, and *boasts* the best corn tortillas in Mexico. One of the few new arrivals *says* she is happier working here. “We *used to live in* an apartment in Mexico City. No flowers, nothing green,” she says. “Now my daughter *has a garden*.”
