== 103. Imagine(v.) the post-pandemic misery of business travel

(eco 2020-5-2 / Business / Bartleby: The road to hell )

The public announcements *could be* worrying, at the least

May 2nd 2020 |


GOVERNMENTS *ARE keen to get employees back to work* in order to limit the economic damage of covid-19. And some companies *will also be eager to send employees out* in search of clients. But a vaccine *is unlikely to be ready for* at least another 12 months. So the next business trip you make *might be* an endurance test. *Imagine*(v.) the public announcements that travellers will hear.

Ding dong. Welcome to the renamed Heathrow Waystation 5. We *decided* the word “terminal” *might be* a little off-putting(a.) to passengers in the current circumstances. Please *check in* your baggage so it can be disinfected(v.): apologies to those whose suitcases *are made out of* genuine leather *as* there *will probably be* stains. But never mind, it *will be* a good excuse *to go shopping* when you get to your destination. After check-in, *head(v.) straight to* security *for* your nasal(a.) swab and temperature check. As everyone *needs to stand* six feet (two metres) apart, the queue *currently snakes* around the building.

When you *make it through security*, *head to* duty-free where you can choose from our extensive selection of hand sanitisers. *Hope you ate(v.) before you arrived* because none of the restaurants is open. Travel safely. Ding dong.

Welcome *aboard* Acme Airlines flight 107 to New York. I am your pilot, Captain Richards. Social-distancing rules *mean* no co-pilot 因为 as there is not enough room in the cockpit for more than one person. But don’t worry; I *brought* a flask of coffee with me and I *haven’t fallen asleep* on a flight yet. If I don’t give you an update every 30 minutes, the cabin crew *will hammer* on the cockpit door.

We *won’t be able to give you* our normal in-flight food and beverage service *but please enjoy* the complimentary(a.) bottle of water, packets(n.) of salted nuts(n.) and crisps(n.), and the empty seat next to you. Just a warning, though, to those of you *who have chosen to sit* by the window. Passengers *must observe*(v.) distancing rules(n.) 因此 so you *won’t be allowed* to squeeze(v.) past the person in the aisle seat if they fall asleep. In any case, only three people *are allowed* in the line for the restroom at any time. You *may want to go easy on* that water. If you *need* anything extra, the cabin crew *will come and help you*. Give them a few minutes 因为 as they *need to don*(v.) a hazmat suit first.

Ladies and gentlemen, you *have arrived at* JFK airport. We have good news and bad news. The good news is that passenger traffic is lower than normal. The bad news is that, given the need to disinfect(v.) the electronic passport reader after each use, the line for immigration *is* still two hours long. And no, you *can’t use* your cell phone *to catch up on calls* while you are in the waiting area. Welcome to the land of the free. Be brave.

*Good afternoon* and *thanks for choosing* Hotel Purgatory(n.) for your stay. Our motto: you *can check in* any time you like but, if we *hear* you coughing, you *can never leave*. Your disinfected room pass *is already available* in a disinfected envelope. Unfortunately, 因为 as only one person *is allowed* in the elevator at a time, the wait time to get to your room *is* 60 minutes. By the way, the same delay *applies* in the morning, so if you *are heading for* meetings, you had better *book*(v.) an early alarm call. There are no baggage porters, so we *hope* you *packed light*.

*To reduce* the risk to staff, the room *will be cleaned* only after you leave, so *make your own bed*. *Feel free(a.) to take home* the shampoo in the shower: no one else *wants to touch* it. The spa, pool and bar *are closed* for obvious reasons, and there is no room service. *Enjoy your stay*.

*Morning(v.) all* and welcome to the 2020 Risk Managers’ Conference. Or *should that be* the Risk Takers’ Conference? Ha ha. *Rest assured* this is a fully sanitised room. This year’s slogan: We *Care About* Your Health Because Your Employer Doesn’t. When it comes to questions, we *won’t be passing round* microphones, so *please speak* as loudly as possible. Panel sessions *are* difficult at the moment, so *will be limited to* two speakers at opposite ends of the stage.

We *are afraid that* a buffet lunch is unavailable 因此 so *take a chance on* one of the street-food carts *outside* the conference centre. Your choice *will sort out* the real risk managers *from* the also-rans. This *wouldn’t be* a conference *without* exhibition *stands in* the foyer. Our sponsors *will be delighted to see you*, but only from a safe distance, and *wearing* a mask. Finally, please *familiarise yourself with* the exits behind me, on the left and right. Obviously they are there in case of a fire but they *could come in handy* if someone has a coughing fit.

== 104. Averting nightmare on Main Street

(eco 2020-5-2 / Finance and economics / Bailing out small businesses: Averting nightmare on Main Street)

Politicians in America and Europe *scramble to help* small firms

But their schemes *are meeting with* mixed success

May 2nd 2020 | WASHINGTON, DC

RANDY HATHCOCK *appeared to be out of options*. The time *had come* for the owner of H&T Truss Mill, a construction company in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, *to decide* how many of his 16 employees *to sack*. The pandemic *had led to* orders drying up. Then a lifeline *appeared*. The Paycheck Protection Programme (PPP), a scheme *administered* by America’s Small Business Administration, *promised* enough *to cover* two-and-a-half months of wages. It was “an answer to our prayers”, says Mr Hathcock. If he *retains* his staff for two years, the $161,200 loan *turns into* a grant.

Voters *abhor*(v.) bail-outs when they *involve* airlines and Wall Street, but *seem* altogether *happier to provide* succour *to* the likes of Mr Hathcock and Main Street. Politicians in America and Europe *have* all the more reason to help: small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) *have been clobbered* by the pandemic, *even more* so *than* their larger peers. `主` Fully 60% of people (who *worked for* businesses with fewer than ten employees in America) [at the start of the year] `谓` *have since been fired*, *according to* one study. In Britain, `主` seven in ten firms *managed* by their owners `谓` *say* they *have lost* over half their revenue.


*Even as* the share prices of listed titans *have perked up* --  the S&P 500 index of large American stocks *is* up by 31% since its nadir on March 23rd -- small firms *are becoming ever more uncertain about* their prospects. Most *have* cash buffers(n.) that *stretch to* weeks, not years. Roughly half of American entrepreneurs *do not expect* business *to recover* within two years, according to a survey by academics at Oxford, Princeton and Yale universities (see chart 1).

Schemes like the PPP *should help*. But `主` rich-country bail-out schemes that *were* put together in a rush `谓` *are experiencing* sharp teething pains. As a result, `主` lifelines that are generous on paper `系` *have been* less so [in practice]. Aid *has not reached* the most distressed firms, and *has been hogged*(v.) by larger SMEs savvy(a.) enough *to navigate*(v.) the bail-out bureaucracy, if not by even bigger businesses (see article).

America and Europe *have adopted* similar strategies *to preserve* the fabric of their economies. First *help* SMEs *cut* cash outgoings *quickly*, for example by *delaying* tax deadlines or even *reversing* past payments. Then *find(v.) ways to lend(v.) or grant(v.) cash* so that companies *make it through the lockdown*.

In Europe, the fastest way for businesses to cut costs *has been* `表` *to lay off* workers temporarily. Britain and all members of the European Union now *have* temporary-unemployment schemes that *allow* firms *to cut* staff hours, sometimes *to* zero. Workers *receive* benefits *in lieu(n.) of* most of their salary. When lockdowns *are lifted*, they *will go back to* their old jobs. That *limits* the disruption to *both* their livelihoods *and* their employers’ prospects.

`主` Such short-time working schemes, which *originated* in Germany and *spread* continent-wide after the global financial crisis, `系` *were* once the purview of big firms, says Stefano Scarpetta of the OECD, a policy adviser to rich countries. Now they *have been opened to* SMEs. The take-up(n.) *has been* rapid. Nearly 11m French workers, or roughly half the salaried workforce, *are temporarily unemployed*. In Germany, more than 700,000 firms *have applied*.

America *has* no such federal scheme (though some states *have* smaller programmes in place). Hence the PPP. But the $349bn *originally allocated to* the programme *ran out* just 13 days after it *was launched* on April 3rd. On April 27th a further $310bn *approved* by Congress *became* available; the demand *crashed* the Small Business Administration’s systems. “It’*s been* all hands on deck *trying to get* the loans approved,” says Darrin Williams, the boss of Southern Bancorp, a Mississippi-delta lender, which *helped* unlock(v.) the PPP riches for Mr Hathcock. Even once firms’ applications *have been approved*, delays(n.) in receiving the cash *are* common.

European countries *have also looked* to direct(v.) cash to small firms -- and *faced* similar delays. In Britain, Germany and Italy, among others, the smallest firms (or self-employed workers) *have received* handouts(n.) reasonably *promptly*. Bigger SMEs *are entitled(v.) to* low-interest loans, typically *covering* three months of payroll. Doling(v.) these out *has proved* tricky.

*To ensure* the money *did not end up going to* businesses *with no hope of paying it back*, bankers *were roped in* to assess(v.) potential recipients. Governments *agreed to shoulder* 70-90% of potential loan losses, *limiting* the downside for banks. Still, lending figures *have underwhelmed*. In Spain [after five weeks] only €13.4bn ($14.6bn) out of €100bn in state guarantees *earmarked for* SMEs *have been tapped*. Britain *managed to allocate* a meagre(a.) £4.1bn ($5.1bn) by April 28th. [From early May] it *will join* Germany *in offering* some loans that *are completely underwritten* by the state. Bankers *can distribute* cash *without having to worry about* the creditworthiness of the borrower.

*There will still be suspicions that* the money *is flowing into* the wrong pockets. A study by researchers at the University of Chicago *finds that* `主` SMEs in the bits of America where activity *had fallen most* `系` *were* only half *as likely* to receive PPP funds *as* those in the least-disrupted places.



In Europe, finding ways to help SMEs *is* economically essential. Nearly half of workers *toil*(v.) in firms with fewer than 50 employees (see chart 2). But many of the most troubled companies *are* in Spain or Italy, which *have been hit especially hard* by covid-19, and where governments *have little fiscal space to fund* large-scale bail-outs. That imbalance *has raised complaints that* firms in the European Union *do not really compete* in a single market.

Given the rush, *it is perhaps not much of a surprise that* [neither] America’s [nor] Europe’s schemes *have achieved* all that policymakers *hoped*.
