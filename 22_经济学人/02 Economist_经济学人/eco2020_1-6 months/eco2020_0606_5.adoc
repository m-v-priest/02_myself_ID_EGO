Yet `主` a less noticed factor that *governed* their responses `系` *is* their differing “business model”. In Silicon Valley this *is* a fuzzier  糊涂的；含混不清的(比较级) concept *than* in the world beyond, *describing* not just how a company *makes money* but the fundamental workings(n.) 基本运作方式 of its economic engine.

At first blush 猛一看，乍看, Twitter and Facebook *look similar*.

*Look closer*, however, and these combinations 结合；联合；混合 of similar attributes *have created* two very different firms, *explains* Dipayan Ghosh, a fellow （学术或专业团体的）会员 at the Harvard Kennedy School and author of “Terms （协议、合同等的）条件，条款 of Disservice” 伤害；帮倒忙的行为, a new book on social media. Twitter *is* essentially 本质上；根本上；基本上 a modern-day 现代的；当代的 “Speakers’ Corner”, where anyone *can hold forth* 喋喋不休；大发议论 and others *can talk back* （尤指对上司）回嘴，顶嘴.

This *makes it easier* to target(v.)面向，把…对准（某群体） ads. Facebook *also benefits from* stronger “network effects”, *meaning that* each additional subscriber *makes* the service *[more useful for others]*, which *attracts* more subscribers, and so on 等等; 诸如此类.

image:../../+ img_单词图片/s/soapbox.jpg[100,100]

- Facebook还受益于更强大的“网络效应”，这意味着每增加一个订阅者, 就会使服务对其他人更有用，从而吸引更多的订阅者，以此类推。而Twitter则不能依赖这样一个涡轮增压般的增长引擎:虽然拥有朋友是人类的一种需求，但即便是对于性格外向者来说，保有一个临时演讲台也不是必需的。


This *goes a long way towards* （对做某事）帮助很大，作用很大 explaining(v.) why in 2019 Facebook *boasted* 有（值得自豪的东西） nine times the users, 21 times the revenue and 12 times the profit of Twitter (see table).

Facebook’s size *has made it* the dominant outlet 出口；排放管;（感情、思想、精力发泄的）出路；表现机会 for political discourse 论文；演讲 in America and elsewhere.

Like Twitter, it *faces* growing pressure *to do more* to fight(v.) illegal content 非法内容, hate speech 仇恨言论 and misinformation (常指故意提供的) 虚假消息 on its platform.

/ [动词 + 名词短语] to be in charge of a discussion or debate and make sure it is fair 主持（讨论、辩论等） +
/ to become or make sth become less extreme, severe, etc. 缓和；使适中 +
-> The television debate *was moderated by* a law professor. 这场电视辩论由一位法学教授主持。

- vulnerable => 来自拉丁语 vulnus,伤口，来自 PIE*wele,拔，击打，词源同 wool,vulture.引申词义有伤口的， 脆弱的。


`主` The company Mr Zuckerberg runs(v.) `谓` also *has to manage* the threat of *becoming the target of* antitrust  反垄断的 investigations, particularly in America. The Trump administration *would probably not hesitate*(v.)（对某事）犹豫，迟疑不决 *to wield that weapon*, 如果 *should* Facebook *take action* that it *might regard as* 将…认为；把…视为；看待 *discriminating(v.) 区别对待；歧视；偏袒 against* what the president calls “conservative views” 保守的观点 -- such as fact-checking 真相核查;核实 his online utterances(n.) 话语；言论 -- especially during this year’s presidential campaign.

- utterance : /ˈʌtərəns/ n. [ C ] something that you say 话语；言论 /[ U ] the act of expressing sth in words 用言语的表达；说话 +
=> 来自utter,说，发出声音。 +
-> one of her few *recorded public utterances* 她仅有的几次公开讲话录音之一 +
-> *to give utterance* to your thoughts 把你的想法说出来

- 扎克伯格经营的公司还必须应对成为反垄断调查目标的威胁，特别是在美国。特朗普政府很可能会毫不犹豫地动用这一武器，如果Facebook采取可能被视为歧视总统所称的“保守观点”的行动-比如对他的网上言论进行事实核查-尤其是在今年的总统竞选期间。


Mr Zuckerberg’s caution(n.) 谨慎；小心；慎重 *is* thus of a piece with his earlier decisions *to not fact-check* political advertisements 政治广告 or *limit* how finely 精致地；精巧地；精确地 such ads *can be targeted*. Twitter, on the other hand, *has banned* political ads *[altogether]*.

Yet the two firms *share* a trait （人的个性的）特征，特性，特点 that *could put them on a similar trajectory* （射体在空中的）轨道，弹道，轨迹. Tech firms, more than other companies, *have to be careful* not to antagonise(v.)使成为敌人; 引起…敌对[对抗] their mostly millennial(a.)一千年的；千禧年的 employees, particularly the best software engineers, who *can easily find work elsewhere* if they are unhappy. Their mostly left-leaning 左倾的 workers *are increasingly upset*(v.)使烦恼；使心烦意乱；使生气 that bosses *are not doing enough* to stop(v.) the spread of misinformation or worse 或者更糟 by politicians and others.

- antagonize : /ænˈtæɡənaɪz/ [ VN ] to do sth to make sb angry with you 使对立；使生气 +
=> 前缀anti-, 相对。词根ag, 做。

If Mr Dorsey *has had a change of heart* 改变态度，改变看法（通常指变得更友好、有益等） and now *allows* tweets like Mr Trump’s *to be flagged*  标示（重要处）, *it is partly because of* constant  连续发生的；不断的；重复的 pressure from employees. Mr Zuckerberg *is now facing* open wrath 盛怒；震怒；怒火 from his troops. On June 1st hundreds of employees *staged* 上演；举办；举行 a “virtual walkout(n.)（突然的）罢工” (by *refusing to work* and *explaining this* in automated 自动化的 email replies) for the first time, in protest against Facebook’s decision *not to take action* against the president’s posts. Perhaps Mr Zuckerberg, like Mr Dorsey, *will end up changing his tune* 曲调；曲子 -- though 虽然，尽管 *he is likely to wait* until he *knows* the outcome of the presidential election in November.

== A tale of two social networks

Twitter and Facebook have differing business models

And that makes for differing attitudes to politics

Jun 4th 2020 | SAN FRANCISCO


BIG EGOS butting heads has been a constant theme of the technology industry. When the personal computer was still young, Microsoft’s Bill Gates, a super-pragmatist, was pitted against Apple’s Steve Jobs, an extreme aesthete. In business software, a later duel was fought between Oracle’s Larry Ellison and SAP’s Hasso Plattner, who locked horns because they were so alike. The latest clash is in social media, between Twitter’s Jack Dorsey and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg—one a hands-off new-ager with a taste for fasting and ice baths, the other an absolutist ruler on a mission to bring the world closer together.

This difference in personality, as well as in their politics, undoubtedly played a role when Mr Dorsey allowed Twitter to flag two recent tweets from President Donald Trump as unacceptable: one for its falsity, the other for glorifying violence. Mr Trump immediately shot back, threatening in a hastily issued executive order to rein in social media, but not before Mr Zuckerberg had appeared on television to protest that he did not want to be the “arbiter of truth” and would never follow Twitter’s lead.

Yet a less noticed factor that governed their responses is their differing “business model”. In Silicon Valley this is a fuzzier concept than in the world beyond, describing not just how a company makes money but the fundamental workings of its economic engine.

At first blush, Twitter and Facebook look similar. Each is a social network, connecting users online and presenting them with content in a “feed”, a never-ending list of posts, pictures and videos of pets. Each makes money by selling advertising, and thus has an interest in using every trick to attract users’ attention. And each employs gobbets of data gleaned from users’ behaviour to allow advertisers to hit targets precisely, for which they pay handsomely.

Look closer, however, and these combinations of similar attributes have created two very different firms, explains Dipayan Ghosh, a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School and author of “Terms of Disservice”, a new book on social media. Twitter is essentially a modern-day “Speakers’ Corner”, where anyone can hold forth and others can talk back. Social-media scholars refer to it as a one-to-many broadcast network. Facebook is at its core a one-to-one or one-to-a-few network, replicating social relationships of the sort between friends, family or colleagues.

The difference may seem subtle, but it has several implications for the two firms’ businesses. For starters, Facebook is able to gather more data about its users because they are more engaged with other users. This makes it easier to target ads. Facebook also benefits from stronger “network effects”, meaning that each additional subscriber makes the service more useful for others, which attracts more subscribers, and so on. Twitter cannot rely on such a turbocharged engine of growth: while having friends is a human need, maintaining a soapbox is non-essential even for the world’s extroverts.

This goes a long way towards explaining why in 2019 Facebook boasted nine times the users, 21 times the revenue and 12 times the profit of Twitter (see table). More importantly, the strong network effects are a prime asset that Facebook has defended vigorously: it has spent vast sums on buying firms it considers likely future competitors, such as Instagram, acquired in 2012 for $1bn, and WhatsApp, for which it paid $19bn in 2014.



Facebook’s size has made it the dominant outlet for political discourse in America and elsewhere. That means it has to be more wary than Twitter when moderating content as it is more vulnerable to accusations of political favouritism and thus to scrutiny by lawmakers. Like Twitter, it faces growing pressure to do more to fight illegal content, hate speech and misinformation on its platform.

The company Mr Zuckerberg runs also has to manage the threat of becoming the target of antitrust investigations, particularly in America. The Trump administration would probably not hesitate to wield that weapon, should Facebook take action that it might regard as discriminating against what the president calls “conservative views”—such as fact-checking his online utterances—especially during this year’s presidential campaign.

Mr Zuckerberg’s caution is thus of a piece with his earlier decisions to not fact-check political advertisements or limit how finely such ads can be targeted. Twitter, on the other hand, has banned political ads altogether.

Yet the two firms share a trait that could put them on a similar trajectory. Tech firms, more than other companies, have to be careful not to antagonise their mostly millennial employees, particularly the best software engineers, who can easily find work elsewhere if they are unhappy. Their mostly left-leaning workers are increasingly upset that bosses are not doing enough to stop the spread of misinformation or worse by politicians and others.

If Mr Dorsey has had a change of heart and now allows tweets like Mr Trump’s to be flagged, it is partly because of constant pressure from employees. Mr Zuckerberg is now facing open wrath from his troops. On June 1st hundreds of employees staged a “virtual walkout” (by refusing to work and explaining this in automated email replies) for the first time, in protest against Facebook’s decision not to take action against the president’s posts. Perhaps Mr Zuckerberg, like Mr Dorsey, will end up changing his tune—though he is likely to wait until he knows the outcome of the presidential election in November.

Google’s removal 除去；消除；清除 of anti-Beijing comments *raises* political eyebrows 扬起眉毛（表示不赞同或惊讶）

The case of the vanishing comments

May 28th 2020 |


ON MAY 26TH Palmer Luckey, an American (best known for *making* virtual-reality headsets （尤指带麦克风的）头戴式受话器，耳机), *alerted* the world *to* an odd phenomenon. YouTube *was deleting* all comments which *mentioned* Wumao 五毛, slang 俚语 for propagandists 宣传者; 传播者 *paid by* the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) *to flood* 大量送至；挤满；拥满 online forums 网络论坛 [*with* pro-CCP views]. “Who at Google [YouTube’s parent  父亲（或母亲）] *decided* to censor(v.)删剪（书籍、电影等中被认为犯忌、违反道德或政治上危险的内容） American comments on American videos *hosted* in America by an American platform *that is already banned* in China?” Mr Luckey *asked* on Twitter.

- headset : a pair of headphones , especially one with a microphone attached to it （尤指带麦克风的）头戴式受话器，耳机 +
image:../../+ img_单词图片/h/headset.jpg[100,100]


Mr Luckey *was not* the first *to notice* this, but his tech heft  (观点、辩论等的)分量; 影响力; 重要性 *drew* an immediate response *from* the right of the political spectrum 谱；光谱, *with which* he *has had connections*. Ted Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas, *called it* “very disturbing(a.)引起烦恼的；令人不安的；引起恐慌的” and *asked* why YouTube *was “censoring* Americans *on behalf of* the CCP”. Jim Banks, a Republican congressman （尤指美国众议院的）国会议员 from Indiana, *fired off* （常指愤怒地）连珠炮似地说，奋笔疾书;开枪；射击 a letter *to* Sundar Pinchai, Google’s boss. One *would expect*, he *wrote*, that the “spirit” of the First Amendment *would be extended into* the American firm’s online platforms.

Google *says* the moderation 评分审核制;适度；适中；合理 of Wumao and other anti-CCP terms *was* an “error”, which *it has fixed*. YouTube’s moderation systems, which *are highly automated*(v.)自动化, *had not taken* “proper 真正的；像样的；名副其实的 context 上下文；语境 *into account* and *incorrectly removed* some comments”.

- moderation : the quality of being reasonable and not being extreme 适度；适中；合理 / (British English) (in education 教育) the process of making sure that the same standards are used by different people in marking exams, etc. 评分审核制 +
-> There was a call for *moderation* on the part of the trade unions. 有人呼吁工会保持克制。


But what context *did* the systems *miss*, and why? Google *will not say*. `主` The conspiratorial 阴谋的；密谋的；似阴谋的 suggestions(n.)使人作（尤其是不好的事情的）推测的理由 (*popular(a.)受喜爱的；受欢迎的；当红的 with* more hyperbolic 夸张的；夸张法的 sectors of the internet commentariat 时事分析评论员) `谓` *do not wash*. `主` The idea that `主` Chinese spies 间谍 who *had infiltrated* （使）悄悄进入，潜入; 渗入；渗透 YouTube `谓` *would risk* *blowing 泄露；暴露 their cover* 掩蔽；遮盖  just *to mess up* 把…弄糟；胡乱地做;使身体受伤；殴打 the moderation system `系` *is* nonsense. So too *is* the suggestion that Google *is somehow being paid off* 用钱封某人的口；买通某人 by the CCP; few issues 重要议题；争论的问题 *cut across* 影响，符合，适用于（分离的不同群体）;抄近路穿过；走近路 the partisan divide 党派分歧 in American politics *more effectively than* the perception  知觉；感知;看法；见解 of a looming threat from China. For Google *knowingly 故意地；蓄意地 to censor* any criticism  批评；批判；责备；指责 of the CCP *would have been* political madness.

- suggestion : [不可数名词, 可数名词, 常用单数形式] *~ of/that* : a reason to think that sth, especially sth bad, is true 使人作（尤其是不好的事情的）推测的理由 +
同义词 hint +
-> A spokesman dismissed *any suggestion of a boardroom rift*.
发言人的话打消了人们关于董事会不和的所有推测。 +
-> *There was no suggestion that* he was doing anything illegal. 说他在从事非法活动无任何根据。

- *cut across sth* : to affect or be true for different groups that usually remain separate 影响，符合，适用于（分离的不同群体） +
-> Opinion on this issue *cuts across* traditional political boundaries. 人们对这个问题的看法超越了传统的政治界限。

- 但是这些系统遗漏了什么上下文背景，为什么呢？谷歌不会透露。那些在互联网评论界更夸张的领域中流行着的阴谋论猜测, 是站不住脚的。认为渗透到YouTube的中国间谍会冒着暴露身份的风险，仅仅是为了扰乱温和体系，这种想法是无稽之谈。谷歌不知何故被中国共产党收买的说法也是如此；几乎没有什么话题, 能比感受到来自中国的迫在眉睫的威胁, 能更有效地跨越美国政治中的党派分歧。如果谷歌在知情的情况下审查对中共的任何批评，那这种做法将会是政治上的疯狂。


More likely, the explanation *lies* in the nature  基本特征；本质；基本性质 of the software Google *uses* to moderate(v.) 审核评分（查看不同阅卷人所打分数是否公平一致） content automatically, which *uses* a set of computer-science techniques *called* machine learning. Such software *can update itself* based on how users *interact 相互影响；相互作用;交流；沟通；合作 with* the website, without any intervention from human programmers. This automated nature, *combined with* the software’s complexity, *make it plausible* 有道理的；可信的 for errors *to arise* in ways that are difficult to understand.

For example, [if YouTube comments(n.) about Wumao and other CCP-critical phrases *are flagged enough times* 次数 by enough users *as* spam(n.)滥发的电邮；垃圾电邮, hate speech or bullying 恃强欺弱的行为], then the system *could start removing them automatically*. This *could be* the result of something *as harmless 无害的;不会引起不快的；无恶意的 as* a furious 激烈的；猛烈的；高速的；盛怒的;狂怒的；暴怒的 comment war between pro- and anti-China factions （大团体中的）派系，派别，小集团, or of a campaign *designed* to influence(v.) the moderation software. Google *says* this *was not* the source of the error, but *would not say* what was.

- spam : /spæm/ ( informal ) advertising material sent by email to people who have not asked for it 滥发的电邮；垃圾电邮 / Spam finely chopped cooked meat that has been pressed together in a container, usually sold in cans and served cold in slices （斯帕姆）午餐肉 +
=> 原为商标名 Spam,命名可能缩写自 spiced ham,香料火腿。由美国 Hormel Foods Corporation 于 1937 年开始生产，二战时声名远扬，成为军队重要供给食品。其在美国的江湖地位类似 +
image:../../+ img_单词图片/s/spam.jpg[100,100]

- faction => 来自词根fact, 做，词源同fact,face. 即做事情的不同人或派别，词义贬义化，指派系等。





*It is* also possible *that* the error *occurred* on Google’s side. Machine-learning systems *need to be given* context *to understand* the material (they are to be used on), and Google *probably contracted out* 订约把…承包出去 the job of *labelling* the Chinese phrases *that are being blocked*. Its supplier 供货商；供货方 *may have labelled* Wumao and other words *as* being in breach(n.)（对法规等的）违背，违犯;突破口；缺口；窟窿 of Google’s community guidelines, without Google *checking its work*. Google *declined* to comment(v.).

Problems with complex systems like this *can be solved*, but they are opaque(a.)不透明的, 难懂；模糊；隐晦；不清楚 *not just* 不仅...还 through Google’s choice, *but* inherently(ad.)固有的；内在的 through their technical design. If YouTube’s comment-moderation systems *were nudged* （朝某方向）轻推，渐渐推动;（用肘）轻推，轻触 into the automated deletion of anti-CCP phrases, despite the application （尤指理论、发现等的）应用，运用 of the highest tech, similar holes *will surely pop up* 突然出现；不意冒出 in future.

The only way for Google *to win* this game of cat-and-mouse `系` *is* to shut down YouTube comments entirely. Or it *could gain an edge* （微弱的）优势 by *spending a lot of money on* humans *to do* the moderating. Neither is likely. Instead, such issues *will probably keep* providing(v.) sticks 枝条；枯枝；柴火棍儿 *with which* Mr Cruz and friends *can beat* the tech giant. *With* the outcome 结果；效果 of a Department of Justice investigation into Google’s monopoly power *looming*, that *may prove* a liability （法律上对某事物的）责任，义务.

- 相反，这样的问题可能会继续提供大棒，克鲁兹先生和他的朋友们可以借此打败这家科技巨头。随着司法部(Department Of Justice)对谷歌垄断权的调查结果的迫近，这可能会被证明是一种责任。

Google’s removal of anti-Beijing comments raises political eyebrows

The case of the vanishing comments

May 28th 2020 |


ON MAY 26TH Palmer Luckey, an American best known for making virtual-reality headsets, alerted the world to an odd phenomenon. YouTube was deleting all comments which mentioned Wumao, slang for propagandists paid by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to flood online forums with pro-CCP views. “Who at Google [YouTube’s parent] decided to censor American comments on American videos hosted in America by an American platform that is already banned in China?” Mr Luckey asked on Twitter.

Mr Luckey was not the first to notice this, but his tech heft drew an immediate response from the right of the political spectrum, with which he has had connections. Ted Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas, called it “very disturbing” and asked why YouTube was “censoring Americans on behalf of the CCP”. Jim Banks, a Republican congressman from Indiana, fired off a letter to Sundar Pinchai, Google’s boss. One would expect, he wrote, that the “spirit” of the First Amendment would be extended into the American firm’s online platforms.

Google says the moderation of Wumao and other anti-CCP terms was an “error”, which it has fixed. YouTube’s moderation systems, which are highly automated, had not taken “proper context into account and incorrectly removed some comments”.

But what context did the systems miss, and why? Google will not say. The conspiratorial suggestions popular with more hyperbolic sectors of the internet commentariat do not wash. The idea that Chinese spies who had infiltrated YouTube would risk blowing their cover just to mess up the moderation system is nonsense. So too is the suggestion that Google is somehow being paid off by the CCP; few issues cut across the partisan divide in American politics more effectively than the perception of a looming threat from China. For Google knowingly to censor any criticism of the CCP would have been political madness.

More likely, the explanation lies in the nature of the software Google uses to moderate content automatically, which uses a set of computer-science techniques called machine learning. Such software can update itself based on how users interact with the website, without any intervention from human programmers. This automated nature, combined with the software’s complexity, make it plausible for errors to arise in ways that are difficult to understand.

For example, if YouTube comments about Wumao and other CCP-critical phrases are flagged enough times by enough users as spam, hate speech or bullying, then the system could start removing them automatically. This could be the result of something as harmless as a furious comment war between pro- and anti-China factions, or of a campaign designed to influence the moderation software. Google says this was not the source of the error, but would not say what was.

It is also possible that the error occurred on Google’s side. Machine-learning systems need to be given context to understand the material they are to be used on, and Google probably contracted out the job of labelling the Chinese phrases that are being blocked. Its supplier may have labelled Wumao and other words as being in breach of Google’s community guidelines, without Google checking its work. Google declined to comment.

Problems with complex systems like this can be solved, but they are opaque not just through Google’s choice, but inherently through their technical design. If YouTube’s comment-moderation systems were nudged into the automated deletion of anti-CCP phrases, despite the application of the highest tech, similar holes will surely pop up in future.

The only way for Google to win this game of cat-and-mouse is to shut down YouTube comments entirely. Or it could gain an edge by spending a lot of money on humans to do the moderating. Neither is likely. Instead, such issues will probably keep providing sticks with which Mr Cruz and friends can beat the tech giant. With the outcome of a Department of Justice investigation into Google’s monopoly power looming, that may prove a liability.
