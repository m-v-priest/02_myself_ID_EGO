- 然而，最近人们开始怀疑, 今天的人工智能技术是否真的像看起来那样能改变世界。它正在遭遇这样或那样的限制，并且未能兑现其支持者的一些更不切实际的承诺。


There is no question that AI -- or, to be precise 确切地说；准确地说, machine learning, one of its sub-fields -- *has made much progress*. Computers *have become dramatically better* at many things they previously struggled with.

Many of the grandest claims made about AI *have once again failed to become reality*

Modern AI technology *has been* far more successful. Billions of people *use it* every day, mostly without noticing, inside their smartphones and internet services. Yet despite this success, the fact *remains* that many of the grandest claims made about AI *have once again failed to become reality*, and confidence *is wavering* as researchers *start to wonder*  想知道；想弄明白；琢磨 whether the technology *has hit a wall*. Self-driving cars *have become* more capable, but *remain* perpetually 永恒地，持久地 on the cusp （两曲线相交的）尖点，会切点，交点 of *being safe enough* to deploy(v.)部署，调度（军队或武器）; 有效地利用；调动 on everyday streets. `主` Efforts *to incorporate* 将…包括在内；包含；吸收；使并入 AI *into* medical diagnosis `谓` *are*, similarly, *taking longer* than expected: despite Dr Hinton’s prediction, there *remains* a global shortage of human radiologists.

-> the implementation(n.) of the new system 新体制的实施

- 心脏病学家、人工智能爱好者埃里克•托波尔(Eric Topol), 在2019年调查了医疗人工智能领域，他写道:“人工智能的炒作程度, 远远超过了人工智能的科学水平，尤其是在涉及患者护理的验证和实施准备方面” 尽管有太多的关于AI如何运用的想法，但在对付covid-19上, 还是用的手头已经有的旧武器上。对接触者进行追踪, 是通过鞋皮和电话进行的。临床试验, 集中在现有药物上。人行道上的塑料屏幕和油漆, 强法治执行了低技术含量的保持距离的建议。


`主` The same consultants 顾问 (who *predict that* AI *will have* a world-altering （使）改变，更改，改动 impact) `谓` also *report that* {real managers in real companies *are finding* AI *hard to implement*}, and *that* {enthusiasm for it *is cooling*}.

- 第二组问题更为深入，与算法本身有关。机器学习使用成千上万的样本来训练软件模型(其结构松散地基于大脑的神经架构)。由此产生的系统可以完成一些任务，比如识别图像或语音，比那些用传统方式用手工制定的规则编程的系统要可靠得多，但它们并不像大多数人理解的那样“智能”。它们是强大的模式识别工具，但缺乏生物大脑天生就具有的许多认知能力。它们艰难地进行逻辑推理; 从自己的发现中概括出规则; 并进行通用多功能的社交行为 -- 由于研究人员缺乏精确到词汇来描述这种任务, 因此就统称为"常识"能力. 结果, ai就只是一个人造的白痴, 它只能精通一个领域的工作, 并且还必须对任务边界界定清楚. 否则, 如果遇到意想不到的数据输入，就会把事情做得很糟糕。

- 如果没有其他突破，这些缺陷就会从根本上限制人工智能能做什么和不能做什么。必须在瞬息万变的世界中行驶的自动驾驶汽车已经被推迟了，而且可能永远不会到来。处理语言的系统，如聊天机器人和个人助理，都是建立在统计方法上的，这些统计方法产生的只是肤浅的理解，而不是真实的理解。这将限制它们的用途。对AI会令放射科医生或卡车司机失业的存在主义式担忧, 看上去言过其实了. -- 更不必说像一些末日论者所说的那样，AI会对人类的生存构成威胁. 认为AI会产生另一个如同中国GDP般巨大的价值, 这种看法现在看来是不可信的.

- overblown : a. that is made to seem larger, more impressive or more important than it really is SYN exaggerated 过分的；夸张的；虚饰过度的 / ( of flowers 花朵 ) past the best, most beautiful stage 残败的；盛期已过的

-> *The wind is picking up* now. 现在风愈刮愈大了。 +
-> *Sales have picked up 14%* this year. 今年销售额增长了14%。

- 今天的“AI之夏”与以往不同。它更明亮、更温暖，因为这项技术已经得到了如此广泛的部署。另一个全面的冬天不太可能到来。但是，秋风正在吹起。

== Artificial intelligence and its limits

An understanding of AI’s limitations is starting to sink in

After years of hype, many people feel AI has failed to deliver, says Tim Cross

Jun 11th 2020 |


IT WILL BE as if the world had created a second China, made not of billions of people and millions of factories, but of algorithms and humming computers. PwC, a professional-services firm, predicts that artificial intelligence (AI) will add $16trn to the global economy by 2030. The total of all activity -- from banks and biotech to shops and construction -- in the world’s second-largest economy was just $13trn in 2018.

PwC’s claim is no outlier. Rival prognosticators at McKinsey put the figure at $13trn. Others go for qualitative drama, rather than quantitative. Sundar Pichai, Google’s boss, has described developments in AI as “more profound than fire or electricity”. Other forecasts see similarly large changes, but less happy ones. Clever computers capable of doing the jobs of radiologists, lorry drivers or warehouse workers might cause a wave of unemployment.

Yet lately doubts have been creeping in about whether today’s AI technology is really as world-changing as it seems. It is running up against limits of one kind or another, and has failed to deliver on some of its proponents’ more grandiose promises.

There is no question that AI -- or, to be precise, machine learning, one of its sub-fields -- has made much progress. Computers have become dramatically better at many things they previously struggled with. The excitement began to build in academia in the early 2010s, when new machine-learning techniques led to rapid improvements in tasks such as recognising pictures and manipulating language. From there it spread to business, starting with the internet giants. With vast computing resources and oceans of data, they were well placed to adopt the technology. Modern AI techniques now power search engines and voice assistants, suggest email replies, power the facial-recognition systems that unlock smartphones and police national borders, and underpin the algorithms that try to identify unwelcome posts on social media.

Perhaps the highest-profile display of the technology’s potential came in 2016, when a system built by DeepMind, a London-based AI firm owned by Alphabet, Google’s corporate parent, beat one of the world’s best players at Go, an ancient Asian board game. The match was watched by tens of millions; the breakthrough came years, even decades, earlier than AI gurus had expected.

As Mr Pichai’s comparison with electricity and fire suggests, machine learning is a general-purpose technology -- one capable of affecting entire economies. It excels at recognising patterns in data, and that is useful everywhere. Ornithologists use it to classify birdsong; astronomers to hunt for planets in glimmers of starlight; banks to assess credit risk and prevent fraud. In the Netherlands, the authorities use it to monitor social-welfare payments. In China AI-powered facial recognition lets customers buy groceries -- and helps run the repressive mass-surveillance system the country has built in Xinjiang, a Muslim-majority region.



AI’s heralds say further transformations are still to come, for better and for worse. In 2016 Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist who has made fundamental contributions to modern AI, remarked that “it’s quite obvious that we should stop training radiologists,” on the grounds that computers will soon be able to do everything they do, only cheaper and faster. Developers of self-driving cars, meanwhile, predict that robotaxis will revolutionise transport. Eric Schmidt, a former chairman of Google (and a former board member of The Economist’s parent company) hopes that AI could accelerate research, helping human scientists keep up with a deluge of papers and data.

In January a group of researchers published a paper in Cell describing an AI system that had predicted antibacterial function from molecular structure. Of 100 candidate molecules selected by the system for further analysis, one proved to be a potent new antibiotic. The covid-19 pandemic has thrust such medical applications firmly into the spotlight. An AI firm called BlueDot claims it spotted signs of a novel virus in reports from Chinese hospitals as early as December. Researchers have been scrambling to try to apply AI to everything from drug discovery to interpreting medical scans and predicting how the virus might evolve.

Dude, where’s my self-driving car?

This is not the first wave of AI-related excitement (see timeline in next article). The field began in the mid-1950s when researchers hoped that building human-level intelligence would take a few years -- a couple of decades at most. That early optimism had fizzled by the 1970s. A second wave began in the 1980s. Once again the field’s grandest promises went unmet. As reality replaced the hype, the booms gave way to painful busts known as “AI winters”. Research funding dried up, and the field’s reputation suffered.

Many of the grandest claims made about AI have once again failed to become reality

Modern AI technology has been far more successful. Billions of people use it every day, mostly without noticing, inside their smartphones and internet services. Yet despite this success, the fact remains that many of the grandest claims made about AI have once again failed to become reality, and confidence is wavering as researchers start to wonder whether the technology has hit a wall. Self-driving cars have become more capable, but remain perpetually on the cusp of being safe enough to deploy on everyday streets. Efforts to incorporate AI into medical diagnosis are, similarly, taking longer than expected: despite Dr Hinton’s prediction, there remains a global shortage of human radiologists.

Surveying the field of medical AI in 2019, Eric Topol, a cardiologist and AI enthusiast, wrote that “the state of AI hype has far exceeded the state of AI science, especially when it pertains to validation and readiness for implementation in patient care”. Despite a plethora of ideas, covid-19 is mostly being fought with old weapons that are already to hand. Contacttracing has been done with shoe leather and telephone calls. Clinical trials focus on existing drugs. Plastic screens and paint on the pavement enforce low-tech distancing advice.

The same consultants who predict that AI will have a world-altering impact also report that real managers in real companies are finding AI hard to implement, and that enthusiasm for it is cooling. Svetlana Sicular of Gartner, a research firm, says that 2020 could be the year AI falls onto the downslope of her firm’s well-publicised “hype cycle”. Investors are beginning to wake up to bandwagon-jumping: a survey of European AI startups by MMC, a venture-capital fund, found that 40% did not seem to be using any AI at all. “I think there’s definitely a strong element of ‘investor marketing’,” says one analyst delicately.

This Technology Quarterly will investigate why enthusiasm is stalling. It will argue that although modern AI techniques are powerful, they are also limited, and they can be troublesome and difficult to deploy. Those hoping to make use of AI’s potential must confront two sets of problems.

The first is practical. The machine-learning revolution has been built on three things: improved algorithms, more powerful computers on which to run them, and -- thanks to the gradual digitisation of society -- more data from which they can learn. Yet data are not always readily available. It is hard to use AI to monitor covid-19 transmission without a comprehensive database of everyone’s movements, for instance. Even when data do exist, they can contain hidden assumptions that can trip the unwary. The newest AI systems’ demand for computing power can be expensive. Large organisations always take time to integrate new technologies: think of electricity in the 20th century or the cloud in the 21st. None of this necessarily reduces AI’s potential, but it has the effect of slowing its adoption.

The second set of problems runs deeper, and concerns the algorithms themselves. Machine learning uses thousands or millions of examples to train a software model (the structure of which is loosely based on the neural architecture of the brain). The resulting systems can do some tasks, such as recognising images or speech, far more reliably than those programmed the traditional way with hand-crafted rules, but they are not “intelligent” in the way that most people understand the term. They are powerful pattern-recognition tools, but lack many cognitive abilities that biological brains take for granted. They struggle with reasoning, generalising from the rules they discover, and with the general-purpose savoir faire that researchers, for want of a more precise description, dub “common sense”. The result is an artificial idiot savant that can excel at well-bounded tasks, but can get things very wrong if faced with unexpected input.

Without another breakthrough, these drawbacks put fundamental limits on what AI can and cannot do. Self-driving cars, which must navigate an ever-changing world, are already delayed, and may never arrive at all. Systems that deal with language, like chatbots and personal assistants, are built on statistical approaches that generate a shallow appearance of understanding, without the reality. That will limit how useful they can become. Existential worries about clever computers making radiologists or lorry drivers obsolete -- let alone, as some doom-mongers suggest, posing a threat to humanity’s survival -- seem overblown. Predictions of a Chinese-economy-worth of extra GDP look implausible.

Today’s “AI summer” is different from previous ones. It is brighter and warmer, because the technology has been so widely deployed. Another full-blown winter is unlikely. But an autumnal breeze is picking up.

The cost of training machines is becoming a problem

Increased complexity and competition are part of it

Jun 11th 2020 |


THE FUNDAMENTAL assumption of the computing industry is that number-crunching gets cheaper all the time. Moore’s law, the industry’s master metronome, predicts that the number of components that can be squeezed onto a microchip of a given size—and thus, loosely, the amount of computational power available at a given cost—doubles every two years.

For many comparatively simple AI applications, that means that the cost of training a computer is falling, says Christopher Manning, the director of Stanford University’s AI Lab. But that is not true everywhere. A combination of ballooning complexity and competition means costs at the cutting edge are rising sharply.

Dr Manning gives the example of BERT, an AI language model built by Google in 2018 and used in the firm’s search engine. It had more than 350m internal parameters and a prodigious appetite for data. It was trained using 3.3bn words of text culled mostly from Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia. These days, says Dr Manning, Wikipedia is not such a large data-set. “If you can train a system on 30bn words it’s going to perform better than one trained on 3bn.” And more data means more computing power to crunch it all.



OpenAI, a research firm based in California, says demand for processing power took off in 2012, as excitement around machine learning was starting to build. It has accelerated sharply. By 2018, the computer power used to train big models had risen 300,000-fold, and was doubling every three and a half months (see chart). It should know—to train its own “OpenAI Five” system, designed to beat humans at “Defense of the Ancients 2”, a popular video game, it scaled machine learning “to unprecedented levels”, running thousands of chips non-stop for more than ten months.

Exact figures on how much this all costs are scarce. But a paper published in 2019 by researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst estimated that training one version of “Transformer”, another big language model, could cost as much as $3m. Jerome Pesenti, Facebook’s head of AI, says that one round of training for the biggest models can cost “millions of dollars” in electricity consumption.

Help from the cloud

Facebook, which turned a profit of $18.5bn in 2019, can afford those bills. Those less flush with cash are feeling the pinch. Andreessen Horowitz, an influential American venture-capital firm, has pointed out that many AI startups rent their processing power from cloud-computing firms like Amazon and Microsoft. The resulting bills—sometimes 25% of revenue or more—are one reason, it says, that AI startups may make for less attractive investments than old-style software companies. In March Dr Manning’s colleagues at Stanford, including Fei-Fei Li, an AI luminary, launched the National Research Cloud, a cloud-computing initiative to help American AI researchers keep up with spiralling bills.

The growing demand for computing power has fuelled a boom in chip design and specialised devices that can perform the calculations used in AI efficiently. The first wave of specialist chips were graphics processing units (GPUs), designed in the 1990s to boost video-game graphics. As luck would have it, GPUs are also fairly well-suited to the sort of mathematics found in AI.

Further specialisation is possible, and companies are piling in to provide it. In December, Intel, a giant chipmaker, bought Habana Labs, an Israeli firm, for $2bn. Graphcore, a British firm founded in 2016, was valued at $2bn in 2019. Incumbents such as Nvidia, the biggest GPU-maker, have reworked their designs to accommodate AI. Google has designed its own “tensor-processing unit” (TPU) chips in-house. Baidu, a Chinese tech giant, has done the same with its own “Kunlun” chips. Alfonso Marone at KPMG reckons the market for specialised AI chips is already worth around $10bn, and could reach $80bn by 2025.

“Computer architectures need to follow the structure of the data they’re processing,” says Nigel Toon, one of Graphcore’s co-founders. The most basic feature of AI workloads is that they are “embarrassingly parallel”, which means they can be cut into thousands of chunks which can all be worked on at the same time. Graphcore’s chips, for instance, have more than 1,200 individual number-crunching “cores”, and can be linked together to provide still more power. Cerebras, a Californian startup, has taken an extreme approach. Chips are usually made in batches, with dozens or hundreds etched onto standard silicon wafers 300mm in diameter. Each of Cerebras’s chips takes up an entire wafer by itself. That lets the firm cram 400,000 cores onto each.

Other optimisations are important, too. Andrew Feldman, one of Cerebras’s founders, points out that AI models spend a lot of their time multiplying numbers by zero. Since those calculations always yield zero, each one is unnecessary, and Cerebras’s chips are designed to avoid performing them. Unlike many tasks, says Mr Toon at Graphcore, ultra-precise calculations are not needed in AI. That means chip designers can save energy by reducing the fidelity of the numbers their creations are juggling. (Exactly how fuzzy the calculations can get remains an open question.)

All that can add up to big gains. Mr Toon reckons that Graphcore’s current chips are anywhere between ten and 50 times more efficient than GPUs. They have already found their way into specialised computers sold by Dell, as well as into Azure, Microsoft’s cloud-computing service. Cerebras has delivered equipment to two big American government laboratories.

“Moore’s law isn’t possible any more”

Such innovations will be increasingly important, for the AIfuelled explosion in demand for computer power comes just as Moore’s law is running out of steam. Shrinking chips is getting harder, and the benefits of doing so are not what they were. Last year Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s founder, opined bluntly that “Moore’s law isn’t possible any more”.

Quantum solutions and neuromantics

Other researchers are therefore looking at more exotic ideas. One is quantum computing, which uses the counter-intuitive properties of quantum mechanics to provide big speed-ups for some sorts of computation. One way to think about machine learning is as an optimisation problem, in which a computer is trying to make trade-offs between millions of variables to arrive at a solution that minimises as many as possible. A quantum-computing technique called Grover’s algorithm offers big potential speed-ups, says Krysta Svore, who leads the Quantum Architectures and Computation Group at Microsoft Research.

Another idea is to take inspiration from biology, which proves that current brute-force approaches are not the only way. Cerebras’s chips consume around 15kW when running flat-out, enough to power dozens of houses (an equivalent number of GPUs consumes many times more). A human brain, by contrast, uses about 20W of energy—about a thousandth as much—and is in many ways cleverer than its silicon counterpart. Firms such as Intel and IBM are therefore investigating “neuromorphic” chips, which contain components designed to mimic more closely the electrical behaviour of the neurons that make up biological brains.

For now, though, all that is far off. Quantum computers are relatively well-understood in theory, but despite billions of dollars in funding from tech giants such as Google, Microsoft and IBM, actually building them remains an engineering challenge. Neuromorphic chips have been built with existing technologies, but their designers are hamstrung by the fact that neuroscientists still do not understand what exactly brains do, or how they do it.

That means that, for the foreseeable future, AI researchers will have to squeeze every drop of performance from existing computing technologies. Mr Toon is bullish, arguing that there are plenty of gains to be had from more specialised hardware and from tweaking existing software to run faster. To quantify the nascent field’s progress, he offers an analogy with video games: “We’re past Pong,” he says. “We’re maybe at Pac-Man by now.” All those without millions to spend will be hoping he is right.
