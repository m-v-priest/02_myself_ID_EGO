A viral(a.)(`=like or caused by a virus 病毒的；病毒性的；病毒引起的`) outbreak(n.) *is no exception*

中国的统治者把每一次危机, 都视为加强控制的机会 +

*Start with* admiration. These construction sites 建筑工地 *are* a fine example of decisive 坚决的；果断的；决断的 Communist Party action.

Work *had been under way*(`=*under way* : having started 已经开始；在进行中`) for two days when Chaguan *visited* the Second People’s Hospital in Changde, a city in the central province of Hunan, 400km from the epidemic’s  传染病；流行病 suspected 有嫌疑的，疑似……的 birthplace 出生地;发源地 in Wuhan.

Half a dozen excavators 挖掘机；挖土机 *roared*(`=roar : 咆哮;呼啸而行；开得飞快`) and *pawed* （不断地）挠，抓 at the rust-red 铁锈红 ground.

A road-roller 压路机 *flattened* （使）变平；把…弄平; 摧毁，推倒，弄倒（建筑物、树木等） a gravel(n.)沙砾；砾石；石子 pad (*on which*, by February 15th, a 200-bed fever 发烧；发热 hospital *is due to stand*).

如果要求一个小说家, 来用一个比喻例子, 来描述世界对现代中国的羡慕和恐惧时，他几乎不可能举出一个例子, 比现在在疾病肆虐的城市中以惊人的速度建立起来的冠状病毒医院, 更出色. 从钦佩开始吧。这些建筑工地是共产党果断行动的一个很好的例子。在茶馆视察位于湖南省常德市的第二人民医院时，相关工作已经进行了两天。常德距离疑似疫情发源地武汉400公里。六辆挖掘机咆哮着，用爪子刨着红锈色的土地。2月15日，一辆压路机压平了一处砂砾地，一所有200个床位的治疗发烧的医院, 将会矗立在那里。

Yet if China’s resolve(n.) *impresses*(v.)使钦佩；使敬仰；给…留下深刻的好印象 outsiders 外人；局外人, the dark side of one-party rule *also stands* 处于（某种状态或情形） exposed.

Changde *must prepare for the worst* in part because the authorities in Wuhan and the surrounding province of Hubei, Hunan’s neighbour, *hid*(`=hide`) the virus’s impact(n.)(`=*~ (of sth) (on sb/sth)* : the powerful effect that sth has on sb/sth 巨大影响；强大作用`) for weeks.

`主` A desire *to earn trust* and *avoid Wuhan’s fate* `谓` *probably explains* {why `主` city-level propaganda(n.) (政治组织的) 宣传 officials in Changde -- when this reporter 记者 *was suddenly handed over to 把某事物╱某人正式交给（某人） them* by jumpy(a.)(`=nervous and anxious, especially because you think that sth bad is going to happen 胆战心惊的；提心吊胆的；紧张不安的`) rural officials and police -- `谓` *granted* （尤指正式地或法律上）同意，准予，允许;（勉强）承认，同意 unusual access to the new hospital}.

然而，如果中国的决心给外界留下了深刻印象，那么一党专政的阴暗面也会暴露出来。常德必须做好最坏的打算，部分原因是, 武汉和邻近湖南的湖北省政府, 将病毒的影响隐瞒了数周。为了赢得信任，避免武汉的命运，这可能解释了为什么当本记者被紧张不安的农村官员和警察, 移交给他们时, 常德市的宣传官员, 不同寻常地允许了本记者, 进入这个新医院进行采访。

The construction site *is overlooked* by an ageing hospital block (which, at the time of writing, *houses* 给（某人）提供住处 62 confirmed cases).

The whole hospital, *emptied of*(`=*empty : ~ sth (out/out of sth); ~ sth (of sth)* : to remove everything that is in a container, etc. 倒空；腾空；掏空`) ordinary patients /and *ringed*(`= *ring : ~ sb/sth (with sth)* : to surround sb/sth 包围；环绕`) by guards(n.) and warning signs, *will soon have room for* between 370 and 850 patients, *depending on* how many *need* strict isolation.

It *will serve* Changde’s roughly 6m residents, who *are divided* between an urban centre and outlying 边远的；偏远的；远离市镇的 rural counties.

Officials *say* they *hope* not to need(v.) all the extra beds.

建筑工地被一座老旧的医院大楼俯视着，在撰写本文时，这栋大楼里有62例确诊病例。整个医院的普通病人已经被清空，周围有警卫和警告标志，根据需要严格隔离的人的数量，很快能够满足从370到850床位的容量。它将为常德市约600万居民服务，这些居民居住在市中心和偏远的农村地区。官员们表示，他们不希望疫情变得需要更多的床位。

China’s pop-up 弹出烤面包片的; 弹起的；有自动起跳装置的 hospitals *do not merely awe* 使敬畏；使惊叹 foreigners. They *have become* a staple(`=a large or important part of sth 主要部分；重要内容`) of domestic propaganda, with state media *pumping out* 大量生产（或制造） tales of building 建筑；建筑业 workers and medics *labouring(v.) to the point of* collapse.

For all that, when *trying to assess* 评估，评定（性质、质量） how this crisis *may affect* the party, *it* is a mistake *to focus narrowly on* top-down （组织或机构中）自上而下的，与高层有关的 actions.

For 因为 the party *is also bent on*(`=*bent on sth/on doing sth* : determined to do sth (usually sth bad) 决心要做，一心想做（通常指坏事）`) a task (that *is less familiar(a.) to outsiders* but *central*(a.)(`=most important 最重要的；首要的；主要的;/having power or control over other parts 起支配作用的；有控制力的`) *to* how China *works* at times of stress): *mobilising* the masses 群众, nationwide(a.)全国性的；遍及全国的；全国范围的.

中国的“速建”医院, 不仅让外国人惊叹。它们已成为中国国内宣传的主要内容，官方媒体大量报道建筑工人和医护人员工作到崩溃的故事。尽管如此，在试图评估这场危机将如何影响共和党时，狭隘地关注自上而下的行动是错误的。因为中共还致力于一项外人不太熟悉、但对中国在压力之下的工作方式至关重要的任务:动员全国的群众。

Some techniques *hark back to*(`=*HARK BACK (TO STH)* 回忆起，重提（过去的事）;使想起；和（过去的事物）相似`) Mao’s time.

Grassroots 基层的；草根的；乡村的 party members *are busy* scolding(v.)训斥，责骂（孩子） and reporting(v.) neighbours who *defy orders* to stay indoors and avoid social gatherings.

[In some regions] `主` village loudspeakers 扬声器,扩音器, which [in the days of collective farms 集体农庄] *blared out* 发出（响亮而刺耳的声音） slogans, patriotic 爱国的 songs and injunctions(`=a warning or an order from sb in authority 警告；指令；命令;/（法院的）强制令，禁制令`) *to work harder*, `谓` *have crackled （像东西在火里燃烧一样）发爆裂声，噼啪作响 back to life* 重获新生;起死回生.

====
- blare => 拟声词。
====

有些技巧可以追溯到毛泽东时代。基层党员正忙着责骂和报告那些不服从命令呆在室内避免社交聚会的邻居。在一些地区，在集体农庄时代的大声呼喊口号、爱国歌曲, 和努力工作的号令的乡村扩音器, 已经恢复了生机。

Public opinion *is hard to gauge* 判定，判断（尤指人的感情或态度）;估计；估算;（用仪器）测量 in authoritarian(a.)威权主义的；专制的 China.

====
- gauge => 来自PIE ghalgh, 杆，棍，词源同gallows. 字母l软化成u. 词义由杆，棍引申为测量，比较canon, 词源同cane.
====

[In Fuqingshan village, *perched*(`=~ (on sth) to be placed on the top or the edge of sth 置于（顶上或边上）;/栖息；停留`) amid 在…中；四周是 strawberry 草莓 farms outside Changde], locals 当地人；本地人 *describe* how they ① *watch for*(`=to look and wait for sb/sth to appear or for sth to happen 观察等待（某人出现或发生某事）`) anyone *arriving from* Hubei and ② *generally “dissuade* 劝（某人）勿做（某事）；劝阻 people *from* wandering(v.)漫游；游荡；闲逛 around”.

Then their party secretary(`=the head of a government department, chosen by the President 部长；大臣;/秘书`) *arrives* [on a moped(`=a motorcycle with a small engine and also pedals 机器脚踏车；摩托自行车`)] *to ban* further interviews, *declaring*: “There is no infectious disease here.”

`主` Elsewhere villagers, of their own volition(`=the power to choose sth freely or to make your own decisions 意志力；自愿选择；自行决断`), `谓` *refer to* virus-control *as* a battle *in which all are enlisted*(`=enlist : *~ (sb) (in/into/for sth); ~ (sb) (as sth)* : to join or to make sb join the armed forces （使）入伍；征募；从军;/ *~ sth/sb (in sth); ~ sb (as sth)* : to persuade sb to help you or to join you in doing sth 争取，谋取（帮助、支持或参与）`): a “people’s war”, *as* the party *now calls it*.

====
- volition => 来自 PIE wel,希望，意愿，词源同 will,voluntary.引申词义意志力。
====

在专制的中国，公众舆论很难衡量。在常德郊外的福清山村(Fuqingshan village)，村民们描述他们如何提防来自湖北的人，并通常“劝阻人们不要到处闲逛”。随后，他们的党委书记开着一辆轻便摩托车来了，禁止进一步采访，并宣称:“这里没有传染病。在其他地方，村民们出于自己的意愿，把控制病毒称为一场所有人都参与的战斗:共产党现在称之为“人民战争”。

[Until January] `主` the pole 柱子；杆子；棍；杖-mounted 安装在电杆上的 loudspeakers that *loom* 赫然耸现；（尤指）令人惊恐地隐现;显得突出；逼近  over Chen Hongxia’s home in Guanyin village `系` *were* mostly quiet, *broadcasting* only a news bulletin （电台或电视台的）新闻简报;公告；布告 each evening.

Now they *blare out*(`=*blare ~ (sth) (out)* to make a loud unpleasant noise 发出（响亮而刺耳的声音）`) hours of virus-control information [from eight each morning].

Ms Chen, 41, *concedes 承认（某事属实、合乎逻辑等） that* the “very noisy”(a.) broadcasts *make it hard* for her son, who is eight, *to study* at home.

*As* she *speaks*, an amplified 扩大 (声音) voice *recites* （尤指对听众）背诵，吟诵，朗诵; （口头）列举；逐一讲述 rules against *hunting or selling* wild animals for meat.

A cancer patient for two years, *wearing* padded （用软材料）填充，覆盖，保护 pink pyjamas （一些亚洲国家男女围腰而系的）宽松裤;（宽大的）睡衣裤 on a brief foray(n.)短途（寻物）；短暂访问（新地方）; 突袭；闪电式袭击 outdoors, Ms Chen *stands out*(`=*stand out (from/against sth)* : to be easily seen; to be noticeable 显眼；突出`) for *not wearing* one of the face masks(n.) that all Chinese *are meant to wear outside*(`=*be meant to be sth* :to be generally considered to be sth 被普遍认为是`), though stocks （商店的）现货，存货，库存 *are running low* 即将用尽, 不够了.

“I *can’t find* anywhere *to buy* a mask. But what should I do? I just *stay at home*,” she explains, as her son *scampers 欢快地奔走；蹦蹦跳跳 up* to join her.

*Asked* whether the state or the masses 群众 *are responsible for* beating(v.) the coronavirus, she *answers*: both. “China *has* a huge population. *If you ask me* who I *should depend on*, I *think* I *need to depend on* myself,” she *ventures* 小心地说，谨慎地做（尤指会使人烦恼或不快的事）;冒着（失去贵重或重要的东西）的危险.

At the same time, she *adds*, the government *has* “a good understanding 理解；领悟；了解 of the big picture(`=the general situation concerning sb/sth 状况；情形；形势`), which individuals *are* incapable(a.) of”(`=*incapable of sth/of doing sth* : not able to do sth 没有能力（做某事）`).

在今年1月之前，观音村的陈洪霞家外的高高的电线杆上的扩音器, 基本上是安静的，每天晚上只播放一则新闻。现在，他们每天早上8点, 就开始大声播送数小时的病毒控制信息。41岁的陈承认，声音“非常恼人”的广播, 让她8岁的儿子很难在家学习。就在她说这些话时，扩大音量的广播, 正转述着禁止捕猎, 或出售野生动物以吃肉的规定。 +
陈患了两年癌症，在一次短暂的户外活动中，她穿着带衬垫的粉色睡衣。她的与众不同之处在于，她没有戴所有中国人都应该在户外戴的口罩，尽管口罩的库存量正在减少。“我找不到买口罩的地方。但是我该怎么做呢? 我只是呆在家里，”她解释道，这时她的儿子蹦蹦跳跳地跑到她身边。当被问及是国家还是群众应对抗击冠状病毒负责时，她谨慎地回答说:都有。“中国人口众多。如果你问我应该依靠谁，我想我需要依靠自己。”她补充道，与此同时，政府“对大局有更好的理解，而个体则很难做到”。

附近的 Luluoping 村, 有3000人, 其中有党员99人. Guo Linlin 就是其中一个党员.  她承认，当地人很害怕，因为“形势正变得越来越严峻”。 她的工作是消除村民的疑虑不安. 包括, 对14名春节期间从湖北工作回来的村民, 进行监督, 以防止他们有客来访, 并对他们每天测两次体温. +
她这个工作, 依赖于"网格化管理"方案. 即, 把村庄一分为二, 把未感染的人, 和疑似感染的人, 分开. 进一步的细分管理, 则由官员和志愿者来负责做. 志愿者中有些老年人, 他们佩戴着红金色疾病控制专用臂章。 +

====

大规模的动员, 在中国有一段黑暗的历史。在一个极易引起争吵的大国, 采取多数派主义, 是一种诱惑，因为它有团结多数人民对抗那些"可疑的"少数派的力量。可耻的是，当地官员一直在容忍对持有湖北身份证件的移民的偏见和义务警戒，即使他们已经几个月没有去过那里(对此的报道和在线视频比比皆是，武汉人被禁止进入酒店，或者被关在自己家中, 门上被杆子或铁链封锁)。


*Blaming* external 外界的；外来的；在外的 foes(`=foe : an enemy 敌人；仇敌`) *is* a temptation, too.

指责外部的敌人也是一种诱惑。中国外交官和官方媒体急切地指责美国不公平地禁止中国游客入境——尽管许多国家也实施了类似的限制。中国的互联网上充斥着关于美国中央情报局制造冠状病毒来压制中国的阴谋论。当中国官员玩弄这种政治把戏时，人们很容易耸耸肩。当然，真正重要的是建造医院和拯救生命?但对中国的统治者来说，政治从来不是游戏。每一次危机都是加强党的控制的机会。病毒也不例外。

== 背景知识: SAT, ACT

加州大学的高管, 提出: 他们认为, SAT和ACT的成绩, 和家庭收入、父母教育和种族, 有强烈的关系，因此用SAT和ACT标准招生是错误的。


|===
|赞同取消SAT和ACT考试的理由: |反对废除SAT和ACT的理由:

|- SAT和ACT考试的成绩受到家庭收入、父母教育和种族的强烈影响 +

- *SAT考试的最高预测价值, 不在于学生在学校的表现如何，而在于他们如何利用备考材料*，而且，获得这些准备材料的机会仍然与家庭收入不成比例地挂钩。 +

- 这两项考试涉嫌“非法歧视残疾人，低收入和少数族裔学生，其违反了加州民权法。 +

- SAT/ACT的公信力和公平一直在不断遭到质疑，并且有歧视非裔、拉丁裔和其他来自贫困家庭的学生，尤其是其高昂的考试费用让不少少数族裔学子望而却步，反而一些有钱人家，家长可以为小孩无限制地刷分和寻求辅导付费。 +
没有足够的考试分数，这些贫困学子就没有办法申请大学，因而导致了大学申请中的不平等，进一步导致大学学生群体多样性的缺乏。

- UC针对标准化考试的研究表明，*尽管SAT和ACT在一定程度上可以预测大学的表现，但"高中成绩"是学生成功的最强单一指标。* +

- 特别是对于那些低收入, 和家庭第一代大学生的申请者，他们可能标化成绩不高，但拥有优异的高中成绩. +

- Brown教务长表示，*他并不反对所有的标准化考试，但反对像SAT和ACT这样的考试。因为这些考试仅用高分和低分来评估一个学生。* 相比之下，他喜欢通过标准化考试来衡量学生掌握了多少规定的学术内容，而不仅是单一的分数。但他更喜欢与加州大学入学要求的课程内容紧密相关的测试。

|- 以公平的名义更多地依赖高中成绩是一种“误导”，因为研究表明，富裕学校的成绩通货膨胀率更高。 +

- 尽管SAT/ACT都不是完美的制度，*但它们并不是导致教育不公平的根源。相反，它们只是只是直观地反映了, 现在高中教育制度和大学招生制度中, 存在的系统不平等现象。* 取消标化考试要求，只是一个简单粗暴的方式，并不能改变不公的本质。

像任何学术性运动的温床一样，加州大学(UC)对理念之争并不陌生。最近，关于在大学入学考试中是否继续使用sat和act的争论, 已经从校园蔓延到了法庭。去年12月，阿拉米达县法院, 受理了一起谴责加州大学使用标准入学考试sat的诉讼。2月3日，审查录取程序的委员会建议加州大学应该抵制放弃考试的呼声。美国有1000多所大学将提交考试成绩作为许多学生的可选项，尽管几乎没有一所大学是完全“考试盲”的。到目前为止，加州大学是考虑放弃它们的最大机构。加州大学的规模(约有22万名本科生)和声望意味着其他人会密切关注它的所作所为。

First administered(v.)(`=administer : to make sure that sth is done fairly and in the correct way 施行；执行`) in 1926, SATs *have faced* criticism for *favouring* 有助于；有利于; 优惠；特别照顾；偏袒 the wealthy since the 1940s -- an irony(n.)（出乎意料的）奇异可笑之处；有讽刺意味的情况, since they *were originally adopted* by Harvard *to expand* its intake(n.)（一定时期内）纳入的人数 beyond the boarding （学生的）寄宿 schools 寄宿学校 of the north-east.

1926年, sat考试被首次执行. 自20世纪40年代以来，它因偏袒富裕家庭而一直饱受批评. 但讽刺的是, 最初采用它的哈佛大学, 其目的正是为了将生源扩大到东北地区寄宿学校以外.  +
尽管负责执行sat考试的美国大学理事会(College Board), 一直在努力消除富裕家庭的孩子拥有的巨大优势——关于桨手和赛艇手的问题已经不复存在 -- 但考试分数与社会经济地位和种族之间的相关性, 一直存在。 +
美国大学理事会承认这些相关性，但认为, 它们只是反映了“由教育和社会地位的不平等, 所导致的穷人和富人孩子的学习水平的差距”，这个问题并不是由考试制度SAT本身所带来的。社会地位的不平等, 肯定会造成任何的大学准备措施都不可能完全公平. 如果不幸地，那些来自贫困家庭的学生成绩更差, 这种现象不足为奇。美国大学理事会(College Board)争辩称，考试分数依然是能帮助大学挑选出那些最有发展潜力的学生的。

关于考试能在多大程度上预测学生在大学的成功，学者们还没有达成共识。大多数人都同意两件事:一是, 高中平均成绩(HSGPA)是预测大学成绩的最佳指标，二是,当高中平均成绩与入学考试相结合时，能使预测更准确。但入学考试要增加到何种程度, 却是有争议的。美国大学理事会(College Board)称，sat考试能够提供更多的预测能力。但许多人对此并不认同。

如果sat考试, 大大降低了那些来自贫困阶层的学生的入学成功率, 则sat即使能够带来更好的大学成绩预测能力, 这一点点的好处, 也不足以证明sat考试就应该存在下去.  大学机构如何权衡这种取舍, 取决于他们自身的使命, 他们所站立的背景, 以及他们想要吸引哪类人进大学.

Three-quarters of the opportunity gap was attributed to factors that preceded admission, most notably failure to complete required courses.

该报告表示，在2019年，加州59%的高中毕业生是少数族裔，而在被录取的新生中，只有37%的加州学生来自这些群体。然而，它得出的结论是，这些测试并不是罪魁祸首。四分之三的机会差距归因于入学前的因素，最明显的是未能完成规定的课程。考试分数被认为在解释剩下的四分之一时起到了一定作用，尽管它们“不是入学的主要障碍”。报告的结论是，加州大学应该“研究开发”一种评估学生的新方法，这可能在9年内实现。

Far from exonerating UC, the report validates the decision to file suit, according to Mr Rosenbaum. He argues that the report merely shifts the blame for the inequalities in the UC system away from the “unlawful use of discriminatory and meaningless tests” and onto the California public school system. Given the sensitivity of the issue, the suit will be controversial and closely followed. It is unlikely to produce a satisfactory outcome. After decades of debate, experts are still unable to agree on either the facts or the morality of the matter. Given this, what hope have the courts?

罗森鲍姆表示，这份报告非但没有为加州大学开脱罪责，反而证明了提起诉讼的决定是正确的。他认为，这份报告只是把加州大学系统不平等的责任从“非法使用歧视性和无意义的测试”转移到了加州公立学校系统。鉴于这个问题的敏感性，这起诉讼将会引起争议，并受到密切关注。不太可能产生令人满意的结果。经过几十年的辩论，专家们仍然无法就这件事的事实或道德达成一致。考虑到这一点，法庭还有什么希望呢?

University of California’s review of its admissions procedures smiles on SATs

Feb 8th 2020 | BERKELEY


LIKE ANY hotbed of scholarly activity, the University of California (UC) is no stranger to rows. Recently a debate over the use of SATs and ACTs, tests used in college admissions, has spilled out from campus and into the courtroom. In December a lawsuit denouncing UC’s use of the tests was filed in the Alameda County court. On February 3rd a commission reviewing admissions procedures recommended that UC should resist calls to abandon tests. More than 1,000 colleges across America have made submitting test scores optional for many students, though hardly any are completely “test blind”. UC is by far the largest institution to consider abandoning them. UC’s size (it has about 220,000 undergraduates) and prestige means others will watch what it does carefully.

First administered in 1926, SATs have faced criticism for favouring the wealthy since the 1940s—an irony, since they were originally adopted by Harvard to expand its intake beyond the boarding schools of the north-east. While the College Board, which owns the SATs, has worked hard to eliminate egregious advantages for children from wealthy families—gone are the questions about oarsmen and regattas—there has been a persistent correlation between test scores and both socioeconomic status and race. The College Board acknowledges these correlations, but argues that they reflect “learning gaps that result from educational and societal inequities”, not bias in the test itself. All measures of college preparedness are affected by societal inequity, and it is unsurprising, if unfortunate, that students from poor backgrounds perform worse. Using test scores, the College Board argues, helps colleges to select those students most likely to thrive.

Academics have reached no consensus on how well the tests predict student success at university. Most agree on two things: that high-school grade point average (HSGPA) is the best predictor of college success and that the tests, when combined with grade averages, make predictions more accurate. How much tests add is disputed. The College Board claims that the additional predictive power offered by the SATs is significant. Many disagree.

Even if the question of predictive power were resolved, another question arises about how good the tests would have to be at predicting college outcomes to justify their use. If they significantly decreased the number of successful applicants from already disadvantaged groups, such a sacrifice would presumably not be justified by a minor gain in predictive power. How institutions judge this trade-off depends on their mission, circumstances and the cohort they want to attract. This goes to the heart of an age-old question. Should universities consider themselves primarily as centres of academic excellence, and therefore strive to accept the students most likely to excel academically? Or should they accept a broader mission to improve society, which could mean sacrificing some academic excellence in the pursuit of a different definition of equality?

The plaintiffs’ arguments imply that no amount of predictive validity justifies the use of the tests in admissions. They allege that UC’s use of tests that are “demonstrably discriminatory” against “talented and qualified students” from poor families, under-represented minorities and students with disabilities is illegal under California law. “Use of the SAT and ACT is not just indefensible policy,” argues Mark Rosenbaum, counsel for the plaintiffs; “it is illegal wealth- and race-discrimination.”

In January 2019, long before the lawsuit, UC commissioned a task-force to review its admissions procedures. It found that the tests are as good as or better than high-school grades at predicting student outcomes. For under-represented minority students, students from poor families and students who were the first in their family to go to college, tests were better predictors of success, as measured by subsequent undergraduate grades, than for other candidates. What is more, because tests and high-school grades are only two of 14 factors used in admissions decisions, students in these less fortunate groups were often admitted at a higher rate for any given test score. Admissions officers took into account factors such as inequality of school resources and access to test preparation, and decided accordingly.

The report expressed concern that whereas 59% of high-school graduates in California were under-represented minorities in 2019, only 37% of Californian students in the admitted freshman class came from these groups. However, it concluded that the tests were not the main culprit. Three-quarters of the opportunity gap was attributed to factors that preceded admission, most notably failure to complete required courses. Test scores were thought to play some role in explaining the remaining quarter, though they were “not the primary barrier to admission”. The report concluded by suggesting that UC should “study the development” for a new approach to assessing students, suggesting that this could be implemented in nine years.

He argues that the report merely shifts the blame for the inequalities in the UC system away from the “unlawful use of discriminatory and meaningless tests” and onto the California public school system. Given the sensitivity of the issue, the suit will be controversial and closely followed. It is unlikely to produce a satisfactory outcome.
