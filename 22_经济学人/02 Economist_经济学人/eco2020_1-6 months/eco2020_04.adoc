== 04. Why so few rapists are convicted

Why so few rapists 强奸犯；强奸者 *are convicted*(`=convict: *~ sb (of sth)* : to decide and state officially in court that sb is guilty of a crime 定罪；宣判…有罪`)

The justice system *is still stacked against*(`=*THE CARDS/ODDS ARE STACKED AGAINST YOU* :you are unlikely to succeed because the conditions are not good for you 形势对你不利; (源自扑克牌游戏中)`) women

为什么很少有强奸犯被定罪 +
司法系统仍然对妇女不利

Jan 2nd 2020

ON JANUARY 6TH a rape trial *will begin* and the world *will hear* all about it.

Harvey Weinstein, a Hollywood mogul(`=a very rich, important and powerful person 大亨；有权势的人;/莫卧儿人`), *will face* five charges of sex crimes.

Dozens of women *have accused him of* using his position *to prey on*(`= *prey on/upon sb/sth* : to hunt and kill another animal for food 捕食；猎获;/to harm sb who is weaker than you, or make use of them in a dishonest way to get what you want 欺凌，坑骗，敲诈（弱者）`) them. In 2017 their testimony 证词；证言；口供 *helped set off*(`=it causes it to start happening. 引发; 激起`) the #MeToo movement.

If *found* guilty, Mr Weinstein, who *denies* all allegations （无证据的）说法，指控 of non-consensual(`=which the people taking part have agreed to （参与者）同意的，赞同的`) sex, *could spend* decades in prison.

====
- mogul => 来自Mongol拼写变体，即蒙古人，于1520年征服印度建立莫卧儿王朝，引申词义大蒙古人，大亨。
- prey => 来自拉丁语praeda,猎物，来自（缩写自）prehendere,抓住，握住，词源同prehensile,predator.引申词义捕食，猎捕等。

1月6日，一场强奸案的审判将开始，全世界都将听到这一切。好莱坞大亨哈维·韦恩斯坦将面临五项性犯罪指控。数十名女性指控他利用职务之便对她们下手。2017年，他们的证词引发了“我也是”运动。如果被判有罪，韦恩斯坦可能会在监狱里呆上几十年。他否认了所有关于非经双方同意的性行为的指控。

`主` The accusations(`= a statement saying that you think a person is guilty of doing sth wrong, especially of committing a crime; the fact of accusing sb 控告；起诉；告发；谴责`) against Mr Weinstein `谓` *set off* such a storm [because so many women *had experienced* something similar].

But in other ways, the case *is wildly unrepresentative*(a.)(`=~ (of sb/sth) not typical of a group of people or things and therefore not useful as a source of information about that group 不典型的；无代表性的`).

Most rape trials *do not involve* a famous defendant 被告人；被告 or multiple(a.)(`=many in number; involving many different people or things 数量多的；多种多样的`) movie stars.

More importantly, most rapes *are not reported* and `主` most that *are reported* `谓` *never come to trial*.

[In England and Wales] `主` only 1.5% of rapes (reported in the year ending March 2019) `谓` *led to charges*(n.)(`=an official claim made by the police that sb has committed a crime 指控；控告;/a statement accusing sb of doing sth wrong or bad 指责；谴责`) (*being filed*)(v.)(`=file : to present sth so that it can be officially recorded and dealt with 提起（诉讼）；提出（申请）；送交（备案）`), *compared with* 7.8% for all crimes and 8.3% for all violent crimes.

对温斯坦的指控引发了一场风暴，因为很多女性都经历过类似的事情。但在其他方面，这一案例极不具有代表性。大多数强奸案的审判, 不涉及著名的被告, 或数量众多的电影明星。更重要的是，大多数强奸案都没有被报道，而且大多数被报道的强奸案, 都没有经过审判。 +
在英格兰和威尔士，截至2019年3月的一年中，只有1.5%的强奸案被起诉，相比之下，所有强奸案的起诉率为7.8%，所有暴力犯罪的起诉率为8.3%。

Rape *is* one of the hardest crimes *to prosecute*(`=*~ (sb) (for sth/doing sth)* : to officially charge sb with a crime in court 起诉；控告；检举`).

After a murder, there is a corpse 尸体；（尤指人的）死尸，尸首.

====
- corpse => 来自词根corp，身体，见corporeal.

After a rape, by contrast 相比之下, there *may be* no physical evidence at all. Often, `主` the only evidence that a crime *has even occurred* `系` *is* the word of the victim 受害者, flatly(ad.)(`=in a way that is very definite and will not be changed 断然；斩钉截铁地`) *contradicted*(`=contradict : to say that sth that sb else has said is wrong, and that the opposite is true 反驳；驳斥；批驳`) by the defendant.

When it *is* essentially 本质上；根本上；基本上 her word against his, it *can be* extremely difficult *to prove* [beyond reasonable doubt 无疑地; 确实地; 排除合理的怀疑;无可置疑] *that* the accuser 原告 *is telling the truth* and the defendant 被告 *is lying*.

It *is* doubly(ad.)(`=more than usual 更加；越发；倍加`) so *when* the general public -- and therefore jurors 陪审员 -- *have deep* misconceptions(`=a belief or an idea that is not based on correct information, or that is not understood by people 错误认识；误解`) about what a typical rape *looks like*, and what a credible(`=that can be believed or trusted 可信的；可靠的`) allegation （无证据的）说法，指控 *sounds like*.

强奸是最难起诉的罪行之一。谋杀之后，会有一具尸体。相比之下，强奸之后可能根本就没有物证。通常，犯罪发生的唯一证据, 就是受害者的话，而被告则断然否认。当她的话与他的相反时，就很难确实地证明, 原告说的是实话，而被告在撒谎。当公众——因而也是陪审员们——对典型的强奸是什么样子，以及可信的指控听起来像是什么样子, 有很深的误解时，情况就更是如此。

As well as *drawing on*(`=*draw on/upon sth* : to use a supply of sth that is available to you 凭借；利用；动用`) the latest research, this article *will use* a fictional(`=not real or true; existing only in stories; connected with fiction 虚构的；小说（中）的`) case study *to illustrate* （用示例、图画等）说明，解释 the difficulty of *weighing*(`=weigh : 称重量，量体重 //*~ sth (up) /~ (up) sth (against sth)* : to consider sth carefully before making a decision 认真考虑；权衡；斟酌`) “he-said-she-said” evidence.

Although our reporters *interviewed* （媒体）采访，访问 numerous(`=many 众多的；许多的`) real-life victims of sexual assault, we *found* it hard *to present*(`=to offer or express sth in speech or writing （口头或书面）表达，表示`) their cases fully and even-handedly(ad.)不偏袒任何一方，以公平公正的方式 without *harming* the individuals involved.

The story of “Jane” and “Joe” *is not* true, but we *have tried to make it typical*(a.)(`=*~ (of sb/sth)* : having the usual qualities or features of a particular type of person, thing or group 典型的；有代表性的`) *of* the vast majority of cases that *never get near* a courtroom(`=a room in which trials or other legal cases are held 法庭；审判室`).

除了引用最新的研究，本文还将使用一个虚构的案例研究, 来说明权衡“他说的与她说的”证据的难度。尽管我们的记者采访了许多真实生活中的性侵的犯受害者，但我们发现, 很难在不伤害当事人的情况下, 全面、公正地介绍他们的案例。“简”和“乔”的故事不是真实的，但我们试图让它成为那些绝大多数的, 典型的, 从未最终进入法庭的案件案例。

Jane is 24 and an office assistant 助理；助手. She *says that* two years ago Joe, a colleague 同事；同僚, *raped* her. They *went for drinks* after work /and she *missed her train home*. They *went back to* his flat. Once they were there, she says, he *held her down*(`=*hold sb down* : to prevent sb from moving, using force 按住某人;/to prevent sb from having their freedom or rights 剥夺某人的自由（或权利）`) and *raped her* despite her *saying* “no” repeatedly. She *did not fight or scream*. They *had kissed* a year *prior to*(`=*prior to* : before sth 在前面的`) the incident, at the office Christmas party.

Joe is a 40-year-old banker. He *says that* on the night in question(`= *in question* : that is being discussed 讨论（或议论）中的`), they *kissed* and then *had consensual(a.)（参与者）同意的，赞同的; 一致同意的 sex*.

The next morning *she left* before he woke. But he *says* they *have stayed on friendly terms*(`=*BE ON GOOD, FRIENDLY, BAD, ETC. TERMS (WITH SB)* : to have a good, friendly, etc. relationship with sb （与某人）关系好（或友好、不好等） /terms :（协议、合同等的）条件，条款`). He *says* it was a classic one-night stand(`=*one-night stand* :  a sexual relationship that lasts for a single night; a person that sb has this relationship with 一夜情缘；露水姻缘；曾与之有一夜情的人`): “she *was totally into* it.” She *is now “clearly lying”*.


简24岁，是办公室助理。她说，两年前，她的同事乔强奸了她。他们下班后去喝酒，她没赶上回家的火车。他们回到他的公寓。她说，他们一到那里，他就把她按住并强奸了她，尽管她一再说“不”。她没有打架，也没有尖叫。事件发生前一年，他们在办公室的圣诞派对上接吻。
乔是一位40岁的银行家。他说，在那个晚上，他们接吻，然后发生了两厢情愿的性行为。第二天早上，她在他醒来之前离开了。但是他说，他们一直保持友好关系。他说这是一个经典的一夜情:“她完全投入其中。她现在“明显在撒谎”。


Many people *faced with* these two accounts(`=a written or spoken description of sth that has happened 描述；叙述；报告;/an explanation or a description of an idea, a theory or a process （思想、理论、过程的）解释，说明，叙述`) *will find* Joe’s more credible(`=that can be believed or trusted 可信的；可靠的`).

People *often think of* rape *as* involving things conspicuously 显著地，明显地 *missing from* Jane’s account: a predatory(a.)(`=using weaker people for their own financial or sexual advantage （在金钱或性关系上）欺负弱小的，压榨他人的;/捕食性的`) stranger, a weapon *used to threaten or hurt*, a secluded(a.)(`=quiet and private; not used or disturbed by other people 僻静的；清静的；不受打扰的`) location and a victim *anxious(a.) to report* the crime [straight away](`=*straight away* : immediately; without delay 立即；马上`).

They are mistaken(a.). “Most common knowledge about sexual assault *is* wrong,” said Barbara Ziv, a forensic(`=法医的;/connected with or used in court 法庭的；与法庭有关的；用于法庭的`) psychiatrist 精神病学家；精神科医生 who *testified*(`=testify : *~ (against/for sb) /~ (to/about sth)* : to make a statement that sth happened or that sth is true, especially as a witness in court （尤指出庭）作证`) *as* an expert 专家 witness 目击者；见证人;证人 in the trial of Bill Cosby, an American comedian 滑稽演员；喜剧演员 *convicted of*(`=*convict sb (of sth)* : to decide and state officially in court that sb is guilty of a crime 定罪；宣判…有罪`) three counts(`=a crime that sb is accused of committing （被指控的）罪状，事项`) of aggravated(a.)(`=an aggravated crime involves further unnecessary violence or unpleasant behaviour （罪行）严重的，加重的`) indecent(a.)(`=thought to be morally offensive, especially because it involves sex or being naked 下流的；有伤风化的；猥亵的`) assault in 2018.


====
- predator => 来自拉丁语praeda,猎物，劫掠，来自prehendere,抓住，抢劫，词源同comprehend,prey.即劫掠者，引申词义捕食者。 +
-> a predatory(`=using weaker people for their own financial or sexual advantage （在金钱或性关系上）欺负弱小的，压榨他人的`) insurance salesman 敛财的保险推销员 +
-> *a predatory look* 色狼般的眼神

- seclude => se-,分开，离开，-clud,关闭，词源同 close,conclude.引申词义隔离，隐居。
- forensic => 来自拉丁语forensis, 集会的，法庭的，词源同forum, 论坛，法庭。
- indecent => in-,不，非，decent,体面的，得体的。即不体面的，引申词义下流的，猥亵的。
====


许多面对这两种说法的人, 会觉得乔的说法更可信。人们通常认为, 强奸会涉及简的描述中明显缺失了的几样东西：在性需求上呈掠食性的陌生人，用于造成威胁或伤害人的武器，一个隐蔽的作案地点，以及一位急于立马报案的受害者。他们的这种认识是错的。法医精神病学家芭芭拉·齐夫(Barbara Ziv), 在2018年美国喜剧演员(黑人)比尔·科斯比(Bill Cosby)被判三项严重猥亵罪的审判中, 作为专家证人作证，她说：“人们的大多数关于性侵犯的常识, 都是错误的。”


[In America] over 127,000 rapes 强奸罪；强奸案 *were reported to police* in 2018; [in England and Wales] 58,947 *were reported* in the year [ending June 2019]. A huge majority of the victims 受害者 *were* women. Many reports *are made long after the event*; `主` more than a quarter of attacks *reported* in England and Wales in 2017 `谓` *took place* over a year before. `主` Some 80% of rapes reported `谓` *are committed 做出（错或非法的事）；犯（罪或错等） by* a person *known to* the victim.

在美国，2018年向警方报告的强奸案超过12.7万起；在英格兰和威尔士，截至2019年6月的一年报告了58，947起强奸案。绝大多数受害者是女性。许多报告都是在事件发生很久之后才发布的；2017年在英格兰和威尔士报告的袭击事件中，有超过四分之一是发生在一年前。被报告的强奸案中, 约有80%, 是受害者所认识的人犯下的。

Sexual assault *typically involves* neither weapons nor visible injuries. The 2017 Crime Survey 对犯罪的调查 for England and Wales *found* the most common location *to be* the victim’s home (39%) and the second most common the offender’s(`=a person who commits a crime 犯罪者；违法者；罪犯`) home (24%).

Just 10% *happen* in a public place such as a park or the street. `主` Nearly a third of people (*claiming to be* the victims of rape) `谓` *said* they *told* no one; over half *told* an acquaintance 认识的人；泛泛之交；熟人; fewer than one in five *told* the police.

When Christine Blasey Ford *claimed*, in testimony(`=a formal written or spoken statement saying what you know to be true, usually in court 证词；证言；口供`) before the United States Senate, *to have been assaulted*(`=*~ (on/upon sb)* : the crime of attacking sb physically 侵犯他人身体（罪）；侵犯人身罪`) decades ago *by* Brett Kavanaugh, then a nominee(`=a person who has been formally suggested for a job, a prize, etc. 被提名人；被任命者`) to the Supreme Court, President Donald Trump *insisted that* `主` anyone who *had experienced* such an assault `谓` *would go straight to* the police. In fact sexual assault 性攻击（指强奸、猥亵） and rape *are* the most underreported 低估；少报（收入等） violent crimes.

性侵犯通常既不涉及武器，也不涉及明显的伤害。2017年, 对英格兰和威尔士的犯罪调查发现，最常见的地点, 是在受害者的家中(39%)，第二常见的地点是在犯罪者的家中(24%)。只有10%发生在公园或街道等公共场所中。在声称是强奸受害者的人中，近三分之一的人说, 他们没有告诉任何人；超过一半的人告诉了熟人；不到五分之一的人告诉了警方。 +
当克里斯汀·布莱西·福特(Christine Blasey Ford)在美国参议院作证时声称，她几十年前遭到当时的最高法院提名人布雷特·卡瓦诺(Brett Kavanaugh)的性攻击（指强奸、猥亵）时，唐纳德·特朗普(Donald Trump)总统坚称，任何经历过此类袭击的人都应该直接向警方报告。事实上，性侵犯和强奸, 是最最被少报的暴力犯罪。

Victims *may not report* their ordeal(`=*~ (of sth/of doing sth)* : a difficult or unpleasant experience 磨难；折磨；煎熬；严酷的考验`) for a number of reasons, such as embarrassment or *thinking* it *will not help*. They *may remain in contact with* their assailant(`=a person who attacks sb, especially physically 攻击者；行凶者`) for work reasons. They *may flirt*(`=~ (with sb) : to behave towards sb as if you find them sexually attractive, without seriously wanting to have a relationship with them 调情`) *with him* or *have sex with him again* as a way *to regain, or establish*, a sense of control over their relationship.

====
- ordeal => 字面意思就是“deal out by gods”（由神灵来施加惩罚）。现在引申为“严峻的考验”。
- flirt => 来自flit, 掠过，轻掠。或直接来自辅音丛bl, fl, 折腾，拍打，拟声词，词源同flap, flabby,flag. 插入字母r, 延长音，模仿调情的声音。
====
受害者可能会因为一些原因, 而不报告他们的苦难经历，比如感到尴尬, 或认为这无济于事。他们可能因为工作原因, 而继续与袭击者保持联系。他们可能会与他调情, 或再次与他发生性关系，以此来重新获得或建立对他们关系的控制感。

Jurors 陪审团成员；陪审员 *can find* this *hard to fathom*(v.)(`=*~ sb/sth (out)* : to understand or find an explanation for sth 理解；彻底了解；弄清真相;/英寻（测量水深单位，合6英尺或1.8米）`).

====
- fathom => 来自PIE pet, 展开，伸展，词源同feather, compete. 用作长度单位法寻，约略等于成人双臂展开长度。引申词义探索，彻底了解。

Defence lawyers *exploit*(`=to treat a person or situation as an opportunity to gain an advantage for yourself 利用（…为自己谋利）;/开发；开采`) their confusion.

[Soon after `主` allegations （无证据的）说法，指控 against Mr Weinstein `谓` *surfaced*(`=to suddenly appear or become obvious after having been hidden for a while （隐藏或被掩盖一段时间后）露面，重新出现，显露，被披露; /升到水面；浮出水面`)] `主` two New York Times reporters 记者 `谓` *revealed* how Mr Weinstein’s then lawyer, Lisa Bloom, *had tried to reassure*(`=~ sb (about sth) : to say or do sth that makes sb less frightened or worried 使…安心；打消…的疑虑`) board members 董事会成员 of his company *by saying* photographs *would soon be published* of “several of the accusers 原告 in very friendly poses with Harvey after his alleged 所谓的；声称的；被断言的 misconduct”(`=unacceptable behaviour, especially by a professional person 失职；处理不当；行为不端`).

When such evidence *reveals* a continued relationship that the accuser *has sought to hide*, it *can be* relevant(`=closely connected with the subject you are discussing or the situation you are thinking about 紧密相关的；切题的; / having ideas that are valuable and useful to people in their lives and work 有价值的；有意义的`).

====
- relevant +
-> Do you have *the relevant*(a.)(`=closely connected with the subject you are discussing or the situation you are thinking about 紧密相关的；切题的`) *experience*? 你有相关的经历吗？ +
-> Her novel *is still relevant*(a.)(`=having ideas that are valuable and useful to people in their lives and work 有价值的；有意义的`) today. 她的小说今天仍有现实意义。
====

The mere fact of a continued relationship, though, *says little*.

陪审员可能会发现这很难理解。辩护律师则会利用他们的这种困惑。在针对温斯坦的指控浮出水面后不久，两名“纽约时报”(New York Times)记者披露，温斯坦当时的律师丽莎·布鲁姆(Lisa Bloom), 曾试图安抚他的公司董事会成员，称一些照片将很快公布, 在这些照片上, “几名原告在指控哈维行为不当后，还摆着非常友好的姿势, 与他在一起”。 +
当一段原告试图想隐瞒的关系, 被这些证据暴露出来后, 这种披露可能是有意义的. 然而，仅仅是受害者与犯罪者拥有这样一段持续的关系, 这一事实本身并不能说明什么。

The absence  不存在；缺乏 of a weapon; missing, imprecise(`=not giving exact details or making sth clear 不确切的；不精确的；不明确的`) or mistaken memories; *delayed* reporting; prior(`=happening or existing before sth else or before a particular time 先前的；较早的；在前的`) acquaintance; claims of consent 同意；准许；允许 -- they all *make* a rape complaint *more likely to be dismissed*(`=to say that a trial or legal case should not continue, usually because there is not enough evidence 驳回；不受理; /不予考虑；摒弃；对…不屑一提`) *by* investigators, even though they are extremely common.

不存在作案工具；作案工具丢失不可寻、不准确或错误的记忆；延迟报告；事先认识犯罪人；声称你情我愿 -- 这些都使得强奸投诉, 更有可能被调查人员驳回，尽管这些投诉非常常见。

[In the past] in the West, and [*to* this day] in such places as Saudi Arabia, a woman’s word *was explicitly(ad.)(`=said, done or shown in an open or direct way, so that you have no doubt about what is happening 直截了当的；不隐晦的；不含糊的 /（说话）清晰的，明确的；直言的；坦率的`) given less weight than* a man’s.

The law *required* a victim’s “prompt(`=done without delay 立即；迅速的；及时的`) outcry”(n.)(`=*~ (at/over/against sth)* a reaction of anger or strong protest shown by people in public 呐喊；怒吼；强烈的抗议`)  and corroboration 确证,确认 of her account “because *ladies lie*”, *as* Morris Ploscowe, a mid-20th-century American legal scholar, *put it*.

从过去的西方，直到今天的诸如沙特阿拉伯等地，女性的话语的被重视程度, 依然很清楚的没有男性那么高。正如20世纪中叶的美国法律学者莫里斯·普洛科夫(Morris Ploscowe)所说，法律要求受害者“立马地大声抗议”，并证实她们说法的真实性, “因为女士常常撒谎”。

Deborah Tuerkheimer, a law professor at Northwestern University in Illinois, *argues*(`=to give reasons why you think that sth is right/wrong, true/not true, etc., especially to persuade people that you are right 论证；说理；争辩`) *that* the American judicial process 司法程序；审判程序 *still systematically discounts*(`=to think or say that sth is not important or not true 认为…不重要；对…不全信；低估; /打折扣；打折出售`) the credibility of accusers 指控者.

The prior conduct and character （人、集体的）品质，性格 of the accuser *routinely 例行地; 常规性地;照例地 come under scrutiny*(n.)(`= careful and thorough examination 仔细检查；认真彻底的审查`).

====
- scrutiny =>  来自拉丁语 scrutinium,检查，搜查，查问，来自 scrutari,检查，搜查，来自 *scruta,碎片，垃圾*，来自 PIE skreu,扩大形式于 PIE sker,砍，切，词源同 shear,shred,scrap.比喻用法，*原义 为从垃圾堆里搜寻有用之物*，引申诸相关词义。

伊利诺伊州西北大学的法学教授黛博拉·图尔克海默(Deborah Tuerkheimer)认为，美国的审判程序, 依然在系统性地看低女性原告的可信度。原告先前的行为和性格特征, 也经常受到审查。

People *who know Jane*, or *think* they know her, *are likely* to find(v.) her story more credible.

“The Weinstein case *is greatly helped by* those (*accusing* him *being* well-known actresses 女演员 [whom] the public *trusts*),” says Elaine Herskowitz, an investigator and consultant 顾问.

And *by the fact that* Mr Weinstein *doesn’t look like* George Clooney, *adds* Bennett Capers, a professor at Brooklyn Law School. [If Joe *is* good-looking] `主` both men and women `系` *are more likely* to believe him *than* if he is not.

认识简的人，或者自认为认识她的人，可能会觉得她的故事更可信。伊莱恩·赫斯科维茨(Elaine Herskowitz)是一名调查员和顾问，她说：“温斯坦一案, 得到了很多人的极大帮助, 这些人指控他对公众们所信任的知名女演员, 进行了性侵犯”. +
布鲁克林法学院(Brooklyn Law School)教授班尼特·卡佩斯(Bennett Capers)补充说，温斯坦看起来长得不像乔治·克鲁尼(George Clooney)那么帅。但如果乔长得很漂亮，世人就会比他长得难看时, 更信任他所说的话。(即, 人们对长得漂亮的人, 会更加迷信的话语的真实性)

*The greater* the power *differential*(n.a.)(`=*~ (between A and B)* : a difference in the amount, value or size of sth, especially the difference in rates of pay for people doing different work in the same industry or profession 差别；差额；差价；（尤指同行业不同工种的）工资级差`) *between* rapist and victim, *the likelier* he *is to get away with*(`=If you *get away with* doing something wrong or risky, you do not suffer any punishment or other bad consequences because of it. 逃脱惩罚`) it, *reckon* criminal-justice(`=justice : the legal system used to punish people who have committed crimes 司法制度；法律制裁；审判`) 刑事审判 scholars.

Jurors *are especially likely to disbelieve* victims if they are sex workers, drug addicts or teenagers.

刑事司法学者认为，强奸犯和受害者之间的权力地位差距越大，他就越有可能逍遥法外。如果受害者本身就是性工作者、吸毒者或青少年，陪审员就特别可能不信任她们的指控。

When a boss harasses(`=harass : to annoy or worry sb by putting pressure on them or saying or doing unpleasant things to them 侵扰；骚扰;/不断攻击（敌人）`) a cleaner 清洁工 who *cannot afford to lose her job*, she *is unlikely to report* him.

And *if she does*, his high social status *may*, in jurors’ minds, *lend credibility 可信性；可靠性 to*(`=*LEND SUPPORT, WEIGHT, CREDENCE, ETC. TO STH* : to make sth seem more likely to be true or genuine 对…提供支持（或强有力的证据、可靠性等使看起来更真实）`) his denial(n.)否认；否定 of wrongdoing(n.)(`=illegal or dishonest behaviour 不法行为；坏事；作恶；欺骗行径`).

当老板骚扰一名不能承受失业的清洁工时，她不太可能举报他。如果她这样做了，这位老板较高的社会地位, 可能会为他在否认他的罪行时所说的话, 在陪审员心中, 提供可信度。
====
- *LEND SUPPORT, WEIGHT, CREDENCE 可信性；真实性, ETC. TO STH* : to make sth seem more likely to be true or genuine 对…提供支持（或强有力的证据、可靠性等使看起来更真实） +
-> This latest evidence *lends support to* her theory. 这一最新的证据, 更加印证了她的理论。

Jeffrey Epstein, a wealthy sex offender who *died* in custody(n.)(`=the state of being in prison, especially while waiting for trial （尤指在候审时的）拘留，拘押，羁押`) in New York, *selected* teenage girls from broken homes *to prey(v.) 猎物;受害者 on*.(`=*prey on/upon sb/sth* : to harm sb who is weaker than you, or make use of them in a dishonest way to get what you want 欺凌，坑骗，敲诈（弱者）;/to hunt and kill another animal for food 捕食；猎获`)

[When Epstein *was first accused*] this *probably made it easier* for his lawyers *to persuade* investigators *that* {his accusers 原告；控告者 *could not be trusted*}.

====
- custody => 来自PIE skeu, 覆盖，遮盖，词源同sky, house, hide.
====

杰弗里·爱泼斯坦(Jeffrey Epstein)是一名富有的性犯罪者, 他在纽约被拘留期间死亡. 他所性侵害的对象, 都是来自破碎家庭关系中十几岁的女孩子。当爱泼斯坦第一次被指控时，他的富有地位, 可能更有利于他的律师来说服调查人员, 使他们相信原告不能被信任。

Jane *goes to* the police. *Asked* why she *didn’t report* the next day, she *says* she *was embarrassed* and *thought* there was no point. She *told* her friend Sally, but nobody else. `主` The only reason why she *is reporting the rape* now, she says, `系` *is that* she *has felt emboldened*(`=to make sb feel braver or more confident 使增加勇气；使更有胆量；使更有信心`) *by* the #MeToo movement.

简去找警察。当被问及为什么她不在受害后的第二天就报案时，她说, 她觉得很尴尬，并认为这没有意义。她把她的受害, 告诉了她的朋友萨利，但没有告诉其他人。她说，她现在愿意报案强奸事件的唯一原因是, #我也是(#MeToo)运动, 给她带来了勇气。

Justice *is hard to get*

正义是很难得到的。

If victims *think* {reporting(v.) assaults *is* pointless(a.)(`=having no purpose; not worth doing 无意义的；无目标的；不值得做的`)}, it *is not* without reason.

In a study recently *released by* America’s National Criminal 刑法的；刑事的 Justice(`=the legal system used to punish people who have committed crimes 司法制度；法律制裁；审判`) Reference Service, researchers *followed(v.) the flow of* reports of rape and attempted(a.)(`=that sb has tried to do but without success 未遂的`) rape in six American jurisdictions(`=an area or a country in which a particular system of laws has authority 管辖区域；管辖范围`) between 2008 and 2012.

[Of 2,887 reports(n.) (by women)] just a fifth *led to* an arrest. Only 1.6% of incidents (reported) *led to* a trial. “Police and prosecutors(`=a public official who charges sb officially with a crime and prosecutes them in court 公诉人；检察官`) *selected* cases *based on* what they *thought* a jury *would believe*,” says Linda Williams, one of the study’s authors 作者.

如果受害者认为, 报告袭击事件是毫无意义的，那也不是没有道理的。在美国国家刑事司法参考服务处, 最近发布的一项研究中，研究人员跟踪了2008至2012年间, 美国六个司法管辖区的强奸和强奸未遂报告的流动情况。在2887起女性举报中，只有五分之一的被告最终被逮捕。在报告的案件中，只有1.6%得到了审判。该研究的作者之一琳达·威廉姆斯(Linda Williams)说，“警方和检察官会选择处理哪一个案件, 是基于他们认为陪审团会信任哪个原告来的。”

Drop-off(n.)(销售或订单等的)下降 rates *seem to be increasing*. In 2018-19 Britain *had* its lowest number of rape prosecutions （被）起诉，检举；诉讼 in a decade, despite the number of police reports(n.) *nearly tripling*(v.)(`=triple : to become, or to make sth, three times as much or as many 成为三倍；使增至三倍`) since 2014.

According to FBI data, in America police *successfully closed* just 33% of rape investigations [in 2018] (including dismissals 驳回（诉讼）；不予受理), the lowest “clearance(n.)(`= the removal of things that are not wanted 清除；排除；清理`) rate 清除率” since the 1960s.

Rape *was second only to* robbery(n.)(`=the crime of stealing money or goods from a bank, shop/store, person, etc., especially using violence or threats 盗窃；抢劫；掠夺`) as the least-solved violent crime.

Lower clearance rates *might be* a sign that police *are keeping* complex cases *open*(`=~ (to sth) not yet finally decided or settled 未决定的；待决定的`) for longer. But it *could equally indicate that* more rapes *are going unsolved*.

起诉数量的下降率(降斜率), 似乎在增加。2018-2019年，英国的强奸起诉数量, 是十年来最低的，尽管警方报告的数量, 自2014年以来几乎增加了两倍。 +
根据联邦调查局的数据，2018年美国警方仅成功结案了33%的强奸案(包括驳回的案件)，这是自20世纪60年代以来的最低值。 +
在破案率最低的那些暴力犯罪中, 强奸案仅次于抢劫案。较低的清案率, 可能反映出了这个迹象, 即: 警方将复杂的案件, 保持在未决状态更久。但也同样能可能反映出另一种可能性, 即更多的强奸案未被处理.


The police *decide to question* Joe. He *accuses* Jane *of* lying. He *says* she is jealous because he *has started* a new relationship. She *is now “crying rape”* for attention, he suggests(`=to state sth indirectly 暗示；言下之意是说 /*~ sth (to sb)* : to put an idea into sb's mind; to make sb think that sth is true 使想到；使认为；表明`).

警察决定审问乔。他指责简撒谎。他说她因为他开始了一段新的恋情, 而产生了嫉妒。他暗示，她如今的“哭喊着她被强奸”，是为了希望获得关注。

Again, Joe’s story *fits with* a public preconception(`=an idea or opinion that is formed before you have enough information or experience 事先形成的观念；先入之见；预想；成见`): the idea that `主` a large proportion of women who *accuse men of* abuse `谓` *are lying*.

According to Ipsos Mori, a pollster 民意测验主办人；民意调查员, 57% of American men and 48% of women *believe that* “`主` false accusations of sexual harassment 骚扰 against men `系` *are* very common.”

In a survey of nearly 900 police officers in America, over half *stated that* 10-50% of sexual-assault complainants 原告 *lie(v.)说谎 about* being attacked. One in ten *said* it was more like 50-100%.

A poll by The Economist *shows that* {in the aftermath 后果；余波 of #MeToo  `主` people *are more worried than before about* false allegations of harassment and rape}.

再一次，乔的故事符合了在公众认识中先入为主的一个观念：即在那些指控遭受了男人性侵的女性中, 有很大一部分人在撒谎。根据民调机构Ipsos Mori的调查，美国人中, 有57%的男性, 和48%的女性认为, “指控男性性骚扰这种事, 非常普遍”。在一项对美国近900名警察的调查中，有超过一半的人表示，有10%-50%的投诉人, 谎称被性侵犯了。有十分之一的人说, 这个比例更像是达到50%-100%。“经济学人”的一项民意调查显示，在#我也是(#MeToo)的运动之后，人们比以前更加担心遭到"骚扰和强奸"的虚假指控。

*It* is impossible *to know* the true rate of false reports. However, in a review of credible(`=that can be believed or trusted 可信的；可靠的`) research, David Lisak, at the time at the University of Massachusetts, *narrowed* the estimate *to* between 2% and 8%.

For those who *are falsely accused*, the process *can be* a nightmare with irreparable(a.)(`= of a loss, injury, etc. 损失、伤害等) too bad or too serious to repair or put right 无法弥补的；不能修复的；不可恢复的`) consequences.

But if police *presume*(`=to accept that sth is true until it is shown not to be true, especially in court 推定；假定`) accusers *are lying*, rape victims *will not come forward*(`=they make themselves known and offer to help. 站出来;主动地响应要求做某事;挺身而出`), and rapists *will rape [with impunity]*(n.)(`=if a person does sth bad with impunity , they do not get punished for what they have done 免于惩罚；不受惩处；逃过惩罚`).

“What you want *is* a system that *treats* both testimonies(`=testimony : 证词；证言；口供`) *[seriously]*, which *is not the same as* automatically believing(v.) all of it,” says John Spencer of Cambridge University.

很难知道虚假控告的真实比率。然而，在一项可信的研究回顾中，当时在马萨诸塞大学的大卫·利萨克(David Lisak), 将这一估计缩小到了2%到8%之间。对于那些被错误指控的人来说，这个过程可能是一场噩梦，并且后果无法挽回。但如果警方认为原告在撒谎，那么强奸受害者将不会站出来报案，强奸犯在犯罪时也不担心自己会受到惩罚。剑桥大学的约翰·斯宾塞(John Spencer)说：“你想要的是这样一个司法体系, 它能认真地为你带来双方的证词，这并不等同于你要自动相信所有的证词。”

False accusations *are much more likely than* real ones (`是False accusations的定语` *to look like* the stereotype of rape (violence, strangers and dark alleys)).

那些含有强奸的刻板印象(暴力、陌生人和黑暗的小巷)的虚假指控, 令人在感觉上, 貌似更像是真实的指控.

A study in 2014 of cases in Los Angeles *found that* of the 4.5% of rape allegations *deemed*(`=to have a particular opinion about sth 认为；视为；相信`) *to be false* by the researchers, over three-quarters *were* for aggravated(a.)(`=an aggravated crime involves further unnecessary violence or unpleasant behaviour （罪行）严重的，加重的`) rape, which *involves* the use of a weapon, multiple suspects 嫌疑犯；嫌疑分子；可疑对象 or collateral(`= connected with sth else, but in addition to it and less important 附属的；附加的；附带的`) injury.

2014年对洛杉矶案件的一项研究发现，有4.5%的强奸指控, 被研究人员认定是虚假的，其中有超过四分之三是严重强奸，涉及使用武器、有多名嫌疑人, 或施加了附带伤害。

====

The investigators *start to dig into* Jane’s accusation. There *are* several gaps(`=a space where sth is missing 缺口；空白；漏洞`) in her story.

She *cannot remember [for sure]* how they *got to* Joe’s flat /*nor* how and when *exactly* she *got home afterwards*. But she *describes* Joe’s sofa [in great detail], *including* the squeaky(a.)(`=making a short, high sound; squeaking 发短促尖叫声的；吱吱叫的；嘎吱作响的`) sound *it made*. Joe’s sofa *does squeak*(v.)(`=to make a short high sound that is not very loud 短促而尖厉地叫；吱吱叫；嘎吱作响`).

调查人员开始深入调查简的指控。她的故事有几处空白。她记不清他们是怎么到乔的公寓的，也记不清她是什么时候怎么回家的。但她非常详细地描述了乔的沙发，包括它发出的吱吱作响的声音。乔的沙发确实吱吱作响。

Neighbours *say* they *heard* no sounds of a struggle; but Jane *does not say* she struggled. She *says* she froze(v.).

There is no physical evidence. Jane *does not claim to have been physically injured*. She *did not go to hospital*. In any case, Joe *does not deny that* they *had sex*.

Phone records *show that* Jane *texted*（用手机给某人）发短信 her friend Sally [the morning after]:

“*need to talk* asap(`=as soon as possible 尽快`) :( call? x”.

Sally’s [diary] *confirms that* Jane *told* her *she had been raped*.

Jane *also sent* two messages *to* Joe [in the weeks after the encounter](`=a meeting, especially one that is sudden, unexpected or violent （意外、突然或暴力的）相遇，邂逅，遭遇，冲突`):

“I’m bored. wassup(`=what is happening? 怎么了？`)) with you? x”.

“you *goin to* the summer party? Hope so”

邻居们说他们没有听到搏斗的声音；但简没有说她挣扎过。她说她冻僵了。

没有物证。简并未声称身体受伤。她没有去医院。无论如何，乔并不否认他们发生过性关系。

电话记录显示，第二天早上简给她的朋友萨莉发了短信：

“需要尽快谈一谈：(打电话？X“。

莎莉的日记证实了, 简告诉她她被强奸了。

在相遇后的几周里，简还给乔发了两条信息：

“我很无聊。你还好吗？X“。

“你要去参加夏令派对吗？”希望如此。“。

Joe *did not reply to* either. On the day that Jane *texted* Sally, he *texted* a friend *about* “*banging*(`=to have sex with a woman 和（女性）性交`)) the babe （对年轻女子或爱人的昵称。男子用以称呼不相识的女子则有冒犯之嫌）宝贝儿，心肝儿 senseless(a.)(`=unconscious 失去知觉`)”.

Beyond testimonial 证明信；介绍信；推荐信 evidence 证明证据; 陈词证据, he-said-she-said inquiries 询问 ; (官方的) 调查 *typically focus on* three things: the victim’s memory, her body and her digital footprints 脚印.

乔没有回复这两个人。简给萨莉发短信的那天，他给一位朋友发了一条短信，内容是“把宝贝干晕了”。

除了证词证据，他说她说的调查通常集中在三件事上：受害者的记忆，她的身体和她的数字足迹。

`主` The ways in which the mind *remembers, and forgets*, assault 侵犯他人身体（罪）；侵犯人身罪 `谓` *can work to* the accuser’s disadvantage(`=disadvantage : something that causes problems and tends to stop sb/sth from succeeding or making progress 不利因素；障碍；不便之处`).

Memory of trauma(`=trauma : a mental condition caused by severe shock, especially when the harmful effects last for a long time 精神创伤;/ an injury 损伤；外伤`) *can record* some particulars 细节; 详情 in excruciating(`=excruciating : extremely painful or bad 极痛苦的；极坏的；糟糕透顶的`) detail [while *leaving* other details hazy(a.)(`= : not clear because of a lack of memory, understanding or detail 记不清的；模糊的;/not clear because of haze 朦胧的；薄雾蒙蒙的`) or forgotten].

大脑对性侵的记忆与遗忘方式, 可能对原告不利。创伤的记忆, 会在记录下一些令人极其痛苦的细节的同时，也会让其他的细节模糊不清或被遗忘。
====
- trauma => 来自希腊语 trauma,创伤，伤害，来自 PIE trau,扩展自 PIE tere,转动，刮擦，词源同 turn,torment. 引申词义精神创伤，痛苦，挫折等。
- excruciating => ex-, 向外。-cruc, 十字，折磨，词源同cross, crucifix. +
-> The pain in my back *was excruciating*(a.). 我的背疼痛难忍。 +
-> *excruciatingly(ad.) uncomfortable* 极不舒服

“[From a survival point(`= : a particular quality or feature that sb/sth has 特点；特性；特征`) of view] *this makes perfect sense*,” says Jim Hopper of Harvard Medical School.

“Our brain *has evolved 逐渐进化 to remember* what to avoid in the future, but *not* what was happening on the other side of the room.”

Alcohol *adds to* the difficulties. In England and Wales over a third of self-reported rape victims *said* they *had drunk alcohol* when they *were attacked*. Heavy drinking *can cause* blackouts(`=blackout : a temporary loss of consciousness , sight or memory 一时性黑蒙；眼前昏黑;/断电；停电`) as well as *removing* the capacity for consent 同意的能力. Even moderate 适度的,温和的；drinking *can blur* the memory of peripheral(a.)(`=peripheral : not as important as the main aim, part, etc. of sth 次要的；附带的;/ connected with the outer edge of a particular area 外围的；周边的`) details.


====
- peripheral => peri-,在周围，-pher,带来，词源同bring,pheromone.引申词义外围，边缘。 +
-> peripheral(a.)(`= : not as important as the main aim, part, etc. of sth 次要的；附带的`) information 辅助信息 +
-> the peripheral(`= : connected with the outer edge of a particular area 外围的；周边的`) nervous system 周围神经系统
====
哈佛医学院的吉姆·霍珀(Jim Hopper)说：“从生存的角度来看，这是完全有意义的。”“我们的大脑已经进化到能够记住将来要避免的事情，而不是房间的另一边正在发生的事情。” 但酒精增加了记忆的困难。在英格兰和威尔士，超过三分之一的自我报案的强奸受害者表示，在受到性侵前, 她们喝过酒。大量饮酒会导致暂时性的失忆，并削弱理性做出同意或拒绝的能力。即使是适度的饮酒, 也会模糊次要细节的记忆。

The body, too, *does not necessarily record* the evidence (people *might expect*).

Non-consensual 未经（参与者）同意的 sex *does not always lead to* injury or physical trauma. One reason *is* “tonic(`=tonic : anything that makes people feel healthier or happier 使精神振奋的东西`) immobility 不动，固定” 强直静止; 紧张性麻痹, a dissociative(a.)(`=dissociative : 游离的；分离的`) response in which the body *goes limp*(`= : not stiff or firm 柔软的；不直挺的`).

- *Tonic immobility* : +
Tonic immobility is a natural state of paralysis that animals enter, often called animal hypnosis. Its function is not certain. It may be related to mating in certain animals like sharks. It may also be a way of avoiding or deterring predators (playing dead is called thanatosis). +
强直性静止是动物进入的一种自然的麻痹状态，常被称为动物催眠。它的功能是不确定的。这可能与某些动物(如鲨鱼)的交配有关。它也可能是一种避免或威慑捕食者的方法(装死被称为假死状态)。

“Victims *are still suspected of lying* if their vulvas(`=vulva : the outer opening of the female sex organs 外阴；女阴`) *aren’t visibly shredded*(`=shred : to cut or tear sth into small pieces 切碎；撕碎`) after a rape,” *writes* Kate Harding, a feminist(n.)(`= : a person who supports the belief that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men 女权主义者；女权运动者`) author, in “*Asking for* It”.

====
- vulva => 来自拉丁语 volvere,转，旋转，词源同 involve,wallet.引申词义包裹，用于解剖学名词外阴。
====
身体产也不一定留下人们期望的证据。非自愿的性行为, 并不总是导致伤害或身体上的创伤。其中一个原因是“强直性静止”症状，这是一种身体变得软弱无力的游离反应。在瑞典的一项研究中，三分之二的强奸案受害者报告说, 她们有“强直性静止”症状。女权主义作家凯特·哈丁在“要求”(asked for It)一书中写道：“如果受害者的外阴在强奸后没有明显地撕裂，那么她们仍然会被怀疑有撒谎的嫌疑。”

Digital records *are* a new source of potential evidence.

When witness statements and other evidence *are* inconclusive(a.)(`= : not leading to a definite decision or result 非决定性的；无定论的；不确定的`), jurors *will struggle to choose* between the accuser’s story and that of the accused.

数字记录是潜在证据的新来源。当从证人的陈述, 和其他的证据上, 无法得出确切的结论时，陪审员将很难在原告和被告之间做出选择。为了增加他们的怀疑，辩护律师还经常试图破坏原告的可信度。在大多数司法管辖区，搜寻任何可疑的过往行为的细节, 已不再被允许。但与被声称的性侵有关系的材料, 仍然是被允许搜寻的。

[In Britain] `主` failures by police and prosecutors  公诉人；检察官 *to investigate* properly(`= in a way that is correct and/or appropriate 正确地；适当地`) accusers’ 原告 phone records /and *disclose*(v.)(`=*disclose sth (to sb)* : to give sb information about sth, especially sth that was previously secret 揭露；透露；泄露`) them *to* the defence(`=*the defence*: 辩护律师`) `谓` *have led to* a number of rape cases *collapsing*(`=: to fail suddenly or completely 突然失败；崩溃；瓦解`).

Such intrusion *is* another reason victims *stop cooperating with* investigations.

====
- peruse => per-,完全的，use,使用。比喻用法。
====
在英国，警方和检察官对原告的电话记录所进行的调查, 方式不适当,  ，并将其电话记录泄露给了辩方律师，这导致了许多强奸案的起诉失败。控方律师担心，作为回应，辩方律师等人对受害人的电话、电子邮件和聊天记录的入侵, 将达到相当于“数字化的脱光衣服搜身”的程度。如果原告还签署了一份名为斯塔福德声明(Stafford Statement)的文书，辩方律师就可以仔细阅读与她相关的大量数字记录，包括来自医生和心理治疗师的记录。这种入侵, 也是受害者对性侵起诉调查, 停止继续配合的另一个原因。

After investigation, the prosecutor *decides* there *is not* enough evidence *to proceed 继续做（或从事、进行） to trial*.

经过调查后，检察官认为没有足够的证据继续进行审判。但简的故事出现在了社交媒体上。看到这篇报道后，另一名女子走上前来，声称乔对她也做了同样的事情。一篇匿名的博客文章声称，20年前，当他(乔)和作者还是实习生的时候，他就“超级令人毛骨悚然”，还“经常谈论他的阴茎”。

据称，2018年7月，阿诺德·科派尔森(Arnold Kopelson)曾对哥伦比亚广播公司(CBS)的董事会成员说:“如果再有30名女性站出来指控这种事情，我不在乎。莱斯是我们的领袖，这不会改变我对他的看法。”

针对该公司首席执行官莱斯•穆恩韦斯(Les Moonves)的行为不端的单一指控，已经变成了一连串. 这么多一连串数量的指控, 意味着，与科普尔森不同的是，公众确实关心他的罪行，而最终, 股东们也开始关心了起来。穆维斯被迫离职; 如果与指控有关的诉讼时效还没有过期，他还可能会被起诉。而穆维斯否认了所有指控。


The retrial 复审；再审 of Mr Cosby *also demonstrated*(`= : to show sth clearly by giving proof or evidence 证明；证实；论证；说明`) the power of numbers.

对考斯比的重审, 也证明了数量能带来力量。针对他的第一起案件于2017年6月开庭审理，最终以陪审团无法得出结论而告终。但在重审时，法官允许另外五名受害者来作证。尽管只有一名正式的原告，但大量的支持性证词, 却帮助了陪审团来判定他有罪。随着时间的推移，一些强奸犯确实会多次实施强奸犯罪-- 这种对强奸这种常见犯罪的罕见例子, 是具有一定真实性的。针对一个被告有多个原告, 能使她们提出的指控更可信，特别是如果他们是各自独立站出来的话。但指控者的数量, 并不一定会让任何一项指控, 在法律上变得更容易被证实被告有罪。

现在已经有了为这项工作构建的在线工具。现在许多大学都在使用Callisto系统，它为那些不愿报告被性侵的人, 提供了两个选择：1.创建记录, 但暂时先不提交报告(以她们将来转而想要提交报告了)，2.或者将肇事者的名字, 输入“匹配”中(只有当多个人同时都输入了相同的名字时，大学当局才会收到通知)。运行该在线工具的非营利组织声称，用户报告被性虐待的可能性是其他人的6倍，而且她们的举报速度, 也比无法使用该在线工具的人快速得多。

在司法机构几十年来都未能认真对待性侵指控之后，#MeToo运动, 展示了社交媒体在传播被性侵的经历故事的巨大力量，并给于原告们一种新的团结感。指控的数量之多, 导致一些刑事案件被立案或重新立案调查。但这反过来也表明，为强奸受害者伸张正义, 或制止性侵犯的袭击者, 是多么困难。

== 04. Why so few rapists are convicted 纯净版

The justice system *is still stacked against* women



Jan 2nd 2020

[ON JANUARY 6TH] a rape trial *will begin* and the world *will hear* all about it. Harvey Weinstein, a Hollywood mogul, *will face* five charges of sex crimes. Dozens of women *have accused him of* using(v.) his position *to prey on* them. In 2017 their testimony *helped* set off the #MeToo movement. If *found guilty*, `主` Mr Weinstein, who *denies* all allegations of non-consensual sex, `谓` *could spend* decades in prison.

The accusations against Mr Weinstein *set off* such a storm because so many women *had experienced* something similar. But in other ways, the case *is wildly unrepresentative*. Most rape trials *do not involve* a famous defendant or multiple movie stars. More importantly, most rapes *are not reported* and `主` most that *are reported* `谓` *never come to trial*. [In England and Wales] only 1.5% of rapes (*reported* in the year *ending* March 2019) *led to charges* (being filed), *compared with* 7.8% for all crimes /and 8.3% for all violent crimes.

Rape *is* one of the hardest crimes *to prosecute*. After a murder, there *is* a corpse. After a rape, by contrast, there *may be* no physical evidence at all. Often, `主` the only evidence that a crime *has even occurred* `系` *is* the word of the victim, *flatly(ad.) contradicted(v.) by* the defendant. When it is essentially her word against his, it *can be* extremely difficult *to prove* [beyond reasonable doubt] *that* the accuser *is telling the truth* and the defendant *is lying*. It is doubly so [when the general public -- and therefore jurors -- *have deep misconceptions about* what a typical rape *looks like*, and what a credible allegation *sounds like*].

As well as *drawing on* the latest research, this article *will use* a fictional case study *to illustrate* the difficulty of *weighing* “he-said-she-said” evidence. Although our reporters *interviewed*(v.) numerous real-life victims of sexual assault, we *found* {it hard *to present* their cases [*fully and even-handedly*] without *harming* the individuals involved}. The story of “Jane” and “Joe” *is not true*, but we *have tried to make it* typical of the vast majority of cases that *never get near a courtroom*.

Jane is 24 and an office assistant. She *says that* two years ago Joe, a colleague, *raped* her. They *went for drinks* after work and she *missed her train home*. They *went back to* his flat. Once they were there, she says, he *held her down* and *raped her* despite her *saying “no” repeatedly*. She *did not fight or scream*. They *had kissed* [a year *prior to* the incident, at the office Christmas party].

Joe is a 40-year-old banker. He *says that* on the night in question, they *kissed* and then *had consensual(a.) sex*. The next morning *she left* before he *woke*. But he *says* they *have stayed [on friendly terms]*. He *says* it was a classic one-night stand: “she *was totally into it*.” She *is now “clearly lying”*.

`主` Many people *faced with* these two accounts `谓` *will find* Joe’s more credible. People *often think of* rape *as* involving things (*conspicuously missing(v.) from Jane’s account)*: a predatory stranger, a weapon *used to threaten or hurt*, a secluded location /and a victim *anxious to report the crime [straight away]*. They *are* mistaken(a.). “Most common knowledge about sexual assault *is* wrong,” said Barbara Ziv, a forensic psychiatrist who *testified as* an expert witness in the trial of Bill Cosby, an American comedian(n.) *convicted of* three counts of aggravated indecent assault in 2018.

[In America] over 127,000 rapes *were reported to police* in 2018; [in England and Wales] 58,947 *were reported* in the year ending June 2019. A huge majority of the victims *were* women. Many reports *are made* [long after the event]; `主` more than a quarter of attacks *reported* in England and Wales in 2017 `谓` *took place* over a year before. `主` Some 80% of rapes (reported) `谓` *are committed by* a person (*known to* the victim).

Sexual assault *typically involves* neither weapons nor visible injuries. The 2017 Crime Survey for England and Wales *found* the most common location *to be* the victim’s home (39%) /and the second most common the offender’s home (24%). Just 10% *happen* in a public place *such as* a park or the street. `主` Nearly a third of people *claiming to be* the victims of rape `谓` *said* {they *told* no one}; over half *told* an acquaintance; fewer than one in five *told* the police. When Christine Blasey Ford *claimed, [in testimony]* before the United States Senate, *to have been assaulted* [decades ago] *by* Brett Kavanaugh, (then a nominee to the Supreme Court), `主` President Donald Trump `谓` *insisted that* `主` anyone who *had experienced* such an assault `谓` *would go straight to the police*. [In fact] sexual assault and rape *are* the most underreported violent crimes.

Victims *may not report* their ordeal *for a number of reasons*, such as embarrassment /or *thinking* it will not help. They *may remain* in contact with their assailant *for work reasons*. They *may flirt with him* or *have sex with him again* as a way *to regain, or establish*, a sense of control over their relationship.

Jurors *can find* this hard *to fathom*. Defence lawyers *exploit* their confusion. [Soon after allegations against Mr Weinstein *surfaced*] `主` two New York Times reporters `谓` *revealed* {how `主` Mr Weinstein’s then lawyer, Lisa Bloom, `谓` *had tried to reassure* board members *of* his company *by saying* `主` photographs `谓` *would soon be published* of “several of the accusers *in very friendly poses with Harvey* after his alleged misconduct”}. When such evidence *reveals* a continued relationship that the accuser *has sought to hide*, it *can be* relevant. `主` The mere fact of a continued relationship, though, `谓` *says little*.

The absence of a weapon; missing, imprecise or mistaken memories; delayed reporting; prior acquaintance; claims of consent -- they all *make* a rape complaint *more likely to be dismissed* by investigators, even though they *are* extremely common.

[In the past] in the West, and [to this day] in *such* places *as* Saudi Arabia, `主` a woman’s word `谓` *was explicitly given less weight* than a man’s. The law *required* a victim’s “prompt(a.) outcry(n.)” and corroboration(n.) of her account [“because ladies *lie*”], *as* Morris Ploscowe, a mid-20th-century American legal scholar, *put it*. `主` Deborah Tuerkheimer, a law professor at Northwestern University in Illinois, `谓` *argues that* the American judicial process *still systematically discounts* the credibility of accusers. `主` The prior conduct and character of the accuser `谓` *routinely come under scrutiny*(n.).

People who *know* Jane, or *think* they know her, *are likely to find* her story *more credible*. “The Weinstein case *is greatly helped by* those *accusing* him *being* well-known actresses [whom] the public *trusts*,” says Elaine Herskowitz, an investigator and consultant. And *by the fact that* `主` Mr Weinstein `谓` *doesn’t look like* George Clooney, *adds* Bennett Capers, a professor at Brooklyn Law School. [If Joe *is* good-looking] both men and women *are more likely to believe him* than *if he is not*.

*The greater* the power differential between rapist and victim, *the likelier* he *is* to get away with it, *reckon* criminal-justice scholars. Jurors *are especially likely to disbelieve* victims *if* they are sex workers, drug addicts or teenagers. When a boss *harasses* a cleaner who *cannot afford to lose her job*, she *is unlikely to report him*. And if she *does*, `主` his high social status `谓` *may*, in jurors’ minds, *lend credibility to* his denial of wrongdoing. `主` Jeffrey Epstein, a wealthy sex offender who *died* in custody in New York, `谓` *selected* teenage girls *from* broken homes *to prey on*. [When Epstein *was first accused*] this probably *made it easier* for his lawyers *to persuade* investigators *that* {his accusers *could not be trusted*}.


Jane *goes to the police*. *Asked* why she *didn’t report* the next day, she *says* she was embarrassed and *thought* there was no point. She *told* her friend Sally, but nobody else. The only reason why she *is reporting* the rape now, she says, *is that* {she *has felt* emboldened(v.) by the #MeToo movement}.

Justice *is hard to get*

If victims *think* {reporting assaults *is* pointless}, it is not without reason. In a study (recently *released by* America’s National Criminal Justice Reference Service), researchers *followed* the flow of reports of rape and attempted rape *in* six American jurisdictions between 2008 and 2012. [Of 2,887 reports(n.) (by women)] just a fifth *led to an arrest*. `主` Only 1.6% of incidents (reported) `谓` *led to a trial*. “Police and prosecutors *selected* cases *based on* what they *thought* a jury *would believe*,” says Linda Williams, one of the study’s authors.

Drop-off rates *seem to be increasing*. [In 2018-19] Britain *had* its lowest number of rape prosecutions in a decade, despite the number of police reports(n.) *nearly tripling* since 2014. According to FBI data, [in America(n.)] police *successfully closed* just 33% of rape investigations in 2018 (including dismissals), the lowest “clearance rate” since the 1960s. Rape *was second only to robbery* as the least-solved violent crime. Lower clearance rates *might be* a sign that police *are keeping* complex cases *open for longer*. But it *could equally indicate that* more rapes *are going unsolved*.

The police *decide to question* Joe. He *accuses* Jane *of* lying. He *says* she is jealous [because he *has started* a new relationship]. She *is now “crying rape”* for attention, he suggests.

Again, Joe’s story *fits with* a public preconception: the idea that `主` a large proportion of women (who *accuse men of* abuse) `谓` *are lying*. According to Ipsos Mori, a pollster, `主` 57% of American men and 48% of women `谓` *believe that* “false accusations of sexual harassment against men *are* very common.” In a survey of nearly 900 police officers in America, over half *stated that* {10-50% of sexual-assault complainants(n.) *lie about* being attacked}. One in ten *said* {it *was* more like 50-100%}. A poll by The Economist *shows that* {[in the aftermath of #MeToo] people *are more worried* than before *about* false allegations of harassment and rape}.

*It* is impossible *to know* the true rate of false reports. However, in a review of credible research, David Lisak, at the time at the University of Massachusetts, *narrowed* the estimate *to* between 2% and 8%. For those (who *are falsely accused*), the process *can be* a nightmare *with irreparable consequences*. But if police *presume* {accusers *are lying*}, rape victims *will not come forward*, and rapists *will rape [with impunity]*. “What you want *is* a system (that *treats* both testimonies *seriously*), which *is not the same as* automatically believing(v.) all of it,” says John Spencer of Cambridge University.

False accusations *are much more likely than* real ones (*to look like* the stereotype of rape (violence, strangers and dark alleys)). A study in 2014 of cases in Los Angeles *found that* {of the 4.5% of rape allegations *deemed* to be false [by the researchers], over three-quarters *were* for aggravated rape, which *involves* the use of a weapon, multiple suspects or collateral injury}.

The investigators *start to dig into* Jane’s accusation. *There are several gaps* in her story. She *cannot remember for sure* {how they *got to Joe’s flat*} nor {how and when exactly *she got home afterwards*}. But she *describes* Joe’s sofa *in great detail*, including the squeaky sound *it made*. Joe’s sofa *does squeak*.

Neighbours *say* they *heard* no sounds of a struggle; but Jane *does not say* she struggled. She says she froze.

There is no physical evidence. Jane *does not claim to have been physically injured*. She *did not go to hospital*. In any case, Joe *does not deny that* they *had sex*.

Phone records *show that* Jane *texted* her friend Sally the morning after:

“need to talk asap :( call? x”.

Sally’s diary *confirms that* Jane told her *she had been raped*.

Jane also *sent* two messages *to* Joe in the weeks after the encounter:

“I’m bored. wassup with you? x”.

“you goin to the summer party? Hope so”

Joe *did not reply to* either. On the day that Jane texted Sally, he *texted* a friend about “*banging* the babe senseless”.

Beyond testimonial evidence, he-said-she-said inquiries(n.) *typically focus on* three things: the victim’s memory, her body and her digital footprints.

`主` The ways in which the mind *remembers, and forgets(v.), assault(n.)* `谓` *can work to* the accuser’s *disadvantage*. Memory of trauma *can record* some particulars [in excruciating detail] while *leaving* other details *hazy or forgotten*. “[From a survival point of view] this *makes* perfect sense,” says Jim Hopper of Harvard Medical School. “Our brain *has evolved to remember* what to avoid in the future, but not what was happening on the other side of the room.” Alcohol *adds to* the difficulties. [In England and Wales] over a third of self-reported rape victims *said* {they *had drunk alcohol* when they *were attacked*}. Heavy drinking *can cause blackouts* as well as *removing the capacity for consent*. Even moderate drinking *can blur* the memory of peripheral details.

The body, too, *does not necessarily record the evidence* people might expect. Non-consensual sex *does not always lead to* injury or physical trauma. One reason *is* “tonic immobility”, a dissociative response in which the body *goes limp*. `主` Two thirds of rape of victims *questioned* in a Swedish study `谓` *reported* symptoms of tonic immobility. “Victims *are still suspected of lying* if their vulvas *aren’t visibly shredded* after a rape,” *writes* Kate Harding, a feminist author, in “*Asking for* It”.

Digital records *are* a new source of potential evidence. When witness statements and other evidence *are inconclusive*, jurors *will struggle to choose* between the accuser’s story and that of the accused. *To increase* their doubts, defence lawyers *often try to demolish* the accuser’s credibility. `主` *Trawling(v.) for* any dodgy-looking detail of prior conduct `系` *is no longer acceptable* in most jurisdictions. But `主` material *relevant to* the relationship (in which an assault *is alleged to have happened*) `谓` *is still allowed*.

[In Britain] `主` failures by police and prosecutors *to investigate properly* accusers’ phone records /and *disclose* them *to* the defence `谓` *have led to* a number of rape cases *collapsing*. Victim advocates *worry that* {[in response] `主` the level of intrusion into phone, email and chat records `谓` *will come to amount to* a “digital strip search”}. [If `主` an accuser `谓` *signs* an instrument *called* a Stafford statement] `主` a wide array of digital records *related to* her `谓` *can be perused*, *including* those from doctors and therapists. Such intrusion *is* another reason victims *stop cooperating with* investigations.

After investigation, the prosecutor *decides* {there *is not* enough evidence *to proceed to trial*}. But Jane’s story *appears on social media*. *Having seen* it, another woman *comes forward* claiming(v.)) Joe *did the same thing to her*. An anonymous blog post(n.) *alleges that* {[when he and the author *were* interns 20 years ago] he *was* “super creepy” /and *would “constantly talk about* his penis”}.

`主` The human resources department at the bank (where Jane and Joe *work*) `谓` *faces* a meltdown; many women, and some men, *say* {they *feel uncomfortable* around Joe}. Joe’s local football club *asks* him *to step down* as coach of its girls’ team. His girlfriend *leaves* him.

Three months later, Jane *resigns from her job*; Joe’s friends at work *make her feel uncomfortable*. Jane *continues to suffer from anxiety*. Joe *has a new girlfriend* and *is working* in a different part of the same bank.

Numbers *matter*

“I *don’t care* if 30 more women *come forward* and *allege this kind of stuff*, *Les is our leader* and *it wouldn’t change my opinion of him*,” Arnold Kopelson [allegedly] *told* fellow members of the board of CBS , a broadcaster, in July 2018. `主` A single accusation of sexual misconduct against the company’s CEO, Les Moonves, `谓` *had become* a spate. But their sheer volume *meant that* {[unlike Mr Kopelson] the public *did care*}, and [in time] the shareholders *came to care*, too. Mr Moonves *was forced out of his job*; he *might have been prosecuted* [had `主` the statute of limitations *relevant to* the allegations `谓` *not expired*]. Mr Moonves *denies* all of the allegations.

The retrial of Mr Cosby *also demonstrated* the power of numbers. `主` The first case against him, which *went to court* in June 2017, `谓` *ended* in mistrial. But [at retrial] the judge *allowed* five additional victims *to testify*. Even though there *was* only one formal complainant, the volume of supportive testimony *helped* the jury *to convict* him. Some rapists *do indeed*, over time, *rape* more than one woman -- a rare example of a commonplace about rape (that *has* some truth). Multiple accusers *make* each other *more credible*, especially if they *come out independently*. But the number of allegations *does not necessarily make* any one *easier to prove* in legal terms.



When legal systems *fail*, people *look elsewhere*. Anonymous early-warning(a.) networks *have existed* for as long as women *have scrawled* the names of dangerous men *on* toilet doors /or *described* colleagues *as* “not safe in taxis”. `主` Shared spreadsheets *such as* the Shitty Media Men list (which *circulated* in New York) /and the Westminster Sex list (*used* in British political circles) `系` *are* digital equivalents.

`主` Online tools *built for* the job `谓` now *exist*. Callisto, a system *now used* in many universities, *gives* those reluctant *to report* assaults 双宾 two options: *create* but *don’t file* a report (in case they *want to file it* in the future) or *enter* their perpetrator *into* “Matching” (college authorities *are only notified* [if several people *enter* the same name]). `主` The non-profit that *runs* it `谓` *claims* {users *are* six times more likely *to report abuse* } and *that* {they do so *much sooner than* people (*without access to* the tool)}.

After decades of institutional failure *to take* allegations *seriously*, `主` #MeToo `谓` *showed* the power of social media *to disseminate* accounts of predation /and *to give* accusers a new sense of solidarity. The sheer volume of allegations *has caused* some criminal cases *to be opened or reopened*. But it *has also shown* {how hard it is *to achieve justice for* rape victims, or *deter* their attackers}.
