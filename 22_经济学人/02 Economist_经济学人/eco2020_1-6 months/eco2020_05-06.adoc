Jan 2nd 2020

THE START of the year *is* traditionally the time *to make resolutions* to change your behaviour. Hardly anyone *keeps* them, of course, but in the spirit of optimism 乐观；乐观主义, here *are* Bartleby’s eight suggestions for what managers *ought to resolve(v.)决心；决定 to do* in 2020.

人们通常在新年伊始, 来制定下新的一年你要改变的行为。当然，很少有人能真正做到它们，但本着乐观的精神，以下是巴特比对经理人在2020年应该决心做些什么, 提出的八条建议。

1-. *Give out* some praise. People *don’t come to work* just for the money. They *like to feel* they are making a valuable contribution. Praise *doesn’t have to happen every day* and it *cannot be generic*(a.)(`=shared by, including or typical of a whole group of things; not specific 一般的；普通的；通用的`).

*Pick* something specific that a worker *has done* which *shows* extra skill or effort /and *single them out*(`=*single sb/sth out (for sth/as sb/sth)* : to choose sb/sth from a group for special attention 单独挑出`); ideally(ad.)(`=perfect; most suitable 完美的；理想的；最合适的`) so that others *can hear* the compliment(`=a remark that expresses praise or admiration of sb 赞扬；称赞`). This is particularly important for the most junior employees, who *will feel anxious about* their status.

给予一些赞美。人们来工作,不只是为了钱。他们喜欢感觉到自己做了有价值的贡献。你不需要每天都给予赞美，但赞美时,也不能泛泛而谈。挑选出某位员工做过的能表现出他们行使了额外技能或努力的事例，将这位员工挑选出来, 表扬他; 最理想的是让别人听到你的赞美。这对初级的员工尤为重要，因为他们一般会对自己的地位, 感到焦虑。

2-. *Remember that* you *set the tone*.

If a manager *is* angry and *swears*(`=to use rude or offensive language, usually because you are angry 咒骂；诅咒；说脏话`) a lot, that *will be seen as* acceptable behaviour.

If bosses *barely communicate*, they *are unlikely to receive* useful feedback.

If they *fail to keep their promises*, workers *will be less likely to co-operate*.

And if a manager *frequently belittles*(`=to make sb or the things that sb does seem unimportant 贬低；小看`) a particular employee, that person *is unlikely to get the respect of* their colleagues.

In contrast, a more relaxed, open boss *is likely to lead to* a relaxed, open workplace.

记住，你定下了基调(即, 你的言行是怎样的, 你部门的文化就是怎样的)。如果一个经理易怒，经常骂人，则这将被你的部属视为可以接受的行为(上梁不正下梁歪)。如果老板很少与员工交流，那他们就不太可能得到员工们对其有用的反馈。如果他们不能兑现自己的承诺，则员工们也不太可能与其合作。如果一个经理经常贬低某个员工，则他(即被贬低的员工)就不太可能得到其他同事的尊重。相比之下，一个更放松、更开放的老板, 才可能会带来一个放松、开放的工作环境。

3-. The buck(`=*the buck* : used in some expressions to refer to the responsibility or blame for sth （用于某些表达方式）责任，过失`) *also stops with you*.

If a team member *makes a mistake*, it *needs to be fixed*. And the manager *is responsible for* making that happen. It *may well*(`=*can/could/may/might well* :  probably 很可能`) *be* `系` that the mistake *stems from* inadequate(`=not enough; not good enough 不充分的；不足的；不够的`) instructions /or *giving the task to* the wrong person. So the manager, *as well as* the staff member, *needs to learn a lesson from* the failure.

责任也止于你。如果一个团队成员犯了错，就需要改正它。经理有责任让这一切发生(即改正属下的任何错误), 因为这很可能是由于你的指令不充分, 或是把任务交给了不合适的人。因此，无论是管理者还是员工, 都需要从失败中吸取教训。
====
- *can/could/may/might well* :  probably 很可能 +
-> You *may well be* right. 你很可能是对的。 +
-> *It may well be that* the train is delayed. 火车很可能晚点了。

- *can/could/may/might well* : with good reason 有充分理由；合理地
-> *I can't very well* leave now. 我现在离开不太合适。 +
-> ‘What are we doing here?’ ‘ *You may well ask* (= I don't really know either) .’ “我们在这儿干什么呢？”“你算问对了（我也不知道）。”
====

4-. *Make* your priorities(`=priority : something that you think is more important than other things and should be dealt with first 优先事项；最重要的事；首要事情`) (for* the next year) *clear*, and *communicate* them *well*. Is the company (or division(`=a large and important unit or section of an organization （机构的）部门`)) *trying to launch a new product*? Or *to boost sales of* existing products? Or *to control costs*? If *you are not sure*, then `主` those who *work for you* `谓` *will have no idea*. That *can lead to* a lot of wasted effort.

明确明年的工作重点，并做好沟通。公司(或部门)正在尝试推出新产品吗? 或者是要促进现有产品的销售? 还是需要控制成本? 如果你不确定明年你的工作重点，那么你的属下人也不会知道。这会导致大量的努力被白费。

5-. To that end(`=an aim or a purpose 目的；目标`) 为了实现那个目标, *cut out*(`= to leave sth out of a piece of writing, etc. 删除；删去;/裁剪`) the jargon  行话；黑话；行业术语；切口.

The use of pretentious(`=trying to appear important, intelligent, etc. in order to impress other people; trying to be sth that you are not, in order to impress 炫耀的；虚夸的；自命不凡的`) phrases and complex acronyms 首字母缩略词 *is generally designed to obfuscate*(v.)(`= to make sth less clear and more difficult to understand, usually deliberately （故意地）混淆，使困惑，使模糊不清`) rather than(`=instead of sb/sth 而不是`) *elucidate*(v.)(`= to make sth clearer by explaining it more fully 阐明；解释；说明`).

In Bartleby’s experience, `主` the reason people *use* unclear language `系` *is that* they *have nothing clear to say*.

If you *are sending* a general memo *to* all the staff, *look carefully through it* and *ask* whether you *would have understood it* on your first day of work. If not, *make it simpler*.

*Remember* George Orwell’s maxim 格言；箴言；座右铭: “*Never use* a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you *can think of* an everyday English equivalent(n.)(`=a thing, amount, word, etc. that is equivalent to sth else 相等的东西；等量；对应词`).” It *applies to* other tongues(`=a particular way of speaking 说话方式; /a language 语言`), too.

====
- obfuscate => ob-,在上，表强调，-fusc,黑的，词源同dusk.即使变黑的，引申词义混淆，模糊。
====

为此，不要使用行话。去使用自命不凡的短语和复杂的缩写词的这种行为, 往往目的是为了故意令人难以理解, 而不是为了阐明清楚。根据巴特比的经验，人们之所以使用含糊不清的语言，是因为他们没有明确的话要说。如果你要给所有的员工发一份备忘录，先仔细看一遍，问问自己在第一天上班时是否就理解它。如果不是，就让这些话语变得更简单。记住乔治•奥威尔(George Orwell)的格言:“如果你能想出一个日常英语中的对等词，就永远不要去使用外国短语、科学词汇或行话。” 它也适用于其他语言。

6-. *Listen to* your staff. They are the people who *are dealing with* customers and suppliers, and *grappling with*(`=*grapple (with sth)* :  to try hard to find a solution to a problem 努力设法解决;/扭打；搏斗`) the bureaucracy(`=the system of official rules and ways of doing things that a government or an organization has, especially when these seem to be too complicated 官僚主义；官僚作风`) of the organisation.

Their feedback *is* essential, *beyond* annual engagement(`=an arrangement to employ sb; the process of employing sb 雇用；聘用;/ fighting between two armies, etc. 战斗；交战`) surveys 敬业度调查.

You *hired* them *for* their skill and expertise(`=expert knowledge or skill in a particular subject, activity or job 专门知识；专门技能；专长`): *learn to rely on it*. If you *don’t trust* their judgment, you *have hired* the wrong people. If you *don’t like* listening to employees, *go* and *set up* as a sole trader(`=A *sole trader* is a person who owns their own business and does not have a partner or any shareholders. 专营商`).

倾听你的员工, 因为他们是直接与客户和供应商打交道的人，同时他们还要与组织中的官僚作风作斗争。因此, 除了年度的敬业度调查之外，他们的反馈对你来说也很重要。你雇佣他们是因为他们的技能和专业知识: 你要学会依赖它。如果你不相信他们的判断，那表明你雇佣错了人。如果你不喜欢听员工的反馈，那你就离开, 并自己创立一个自己独立的公司, 自己做老板吧。

7-. *Keep meetings short*. Ideally 理想地情况下, a meeting *should be* the length of a sitcom(`=情景喜剧situation comedy`) episode （人生的）一段经历；（小说的）片段，插曲; （电视连续剧或无线电广播剧的）一集 *not* a film by Martin Scorsese.

Bartleby’s law *is that* {80% of the time of 80% of the people at meetings *is wasted*}.

If you *doubt* the numbers, *have a think about* the last big meeting you *attended*. *Did* everyone *speak* /or *was* the discussion *dominated by* a small subset(`=a smaller group of people or things formed from the members of a larger group 分组；小组；子集`)?

How many people *were gazing at* their phones? A lot of people attend meetings *out of*(`=*out of sth* : used to show the reason why sth is done （表示原因）因为，出于`) a sense of duty or FOMO (fear of *missing out*)(`=*miss sb/sth out* : (BrE) to fail to include sb/sth in sth 不包括…在内；遗漏; /*miss out (on sth)* : to fail to benefit from sth useful or enjoyable by not taking part in it 错失获利（或取乐等）的机会`) .

And what is the purpose of the meeting? If it is just *to update*(`=*~ sb (on sth) /~ sth* : to give sb the most recent information about sth; to add the most recent information to sth 向…提供最新信息；给…增加最新信息`) people *on* progress, that *can be done* in an email or in a one-to-one conversation (which *has* the added benefit of *allowing* you *to talk to* your staff).

`主` Big meetings *involving* all the staff `谓` *should be reserved*(`=*~ sth (for sb/sth)* : to keep sth for sb/sth, so that it cannot be used by any other person or for any other reason 保留；贮备`) *for* big news(`=new information about sth that has happened recently 消息；音信`) like acquisitions(`= a company, piece of land, etc. bought by sb, especially another company; the act of buying it 购置物；收购的公司；购置的产业；购置；收购`) or lay-offs(`=lay-off : an act of making people unemployed because there is no more work left for them to do （因工作不多的）解雇，裁员`).

缩短会议时间。理想情况下，一次会议应该是情景喜剧一集的长度，而不是马丁·斯科塞斯(Martin Scorsese)的一部电影的长度。巴特比定律认为，80%的人在开会时有80%的时间被浪费了。如果你怀疑这些数字，想想你参加的最后一次大型会议。是每个人都发言了，还是只有一小部分人主导了讨论？有多少人在盯着手机看？ +
很多人参加会议是出于责任感, 或FOMO(害怕错过)。这次会议的目的是什么？如果只是为了让员工了解最新进展，可以通过电子邮件或一对一对话(这样做的另一个好处是可以让您与员工交谈)。所有员工参加的大型会议, 应该留给收购或裁员等重大信息上。

8-. *Drop*(`=to stop doing or discussing sth; to not continue with sth 停止；终止；放弃`) the team-building exercises.

Paintballing(`=paintball : a game in which people shoot balls of paint at each other 彩弹游戏`) in the woods,

*tackling*(`=tackle : to make a determined effort to deal with a difficult problem or situation 应付，处理，解决（难题或局面）;/抢球；抢断；抢截；铲断;/擒抱摔倒；阻截`) an army assault-course(`=An *assault course* is an area of land covered with obstacles such as walls which people, especially soldiers, use to improve their skills and strength. (用以训练士兵等的)设有障碍物的区域; 野战训练场`),

*constructing*(`=*~ sth (from/out of/of sth)* : to build or make sth such as a road, building or machine 建筑；修建；建造`) a model of the Empire State Building *from* matchsticks(`=a single wooden match 火柴杆；火柴棍`) -- no one *wants to do* this stuff.

They *don’t want to go to* an awayday(n.)(`=An *Awayday* is the term used in British business for a meeting, often of a whole department, project or sales team, which takes place off-site and away from the participants' regular office surroundings, usually for a whole day or sometimes a weekend. “会议日”(away day)是英国商务中用来表示会议的一个术语，通常指整个部门、项目或销售团队的会议，开会地点通常是在工作场所之外，远离与会者通常的办公环境，开会时间通常是一整天，有时是周末。`) weekend, either(`=
used to add extra information to a statement （补充时说）而且`); they *would much rather* be at home with their families.

放弃团队建设练习。在树林里玩彩弹游戏，对付军队的突袭，用火柴棍做一个帝国大厦的模型，没有人愿意做这些事情。他们也不想周末被拉出去开一整天的公司场外会议; 他们宁愿呆在家里和家人在一起。

====
- assault-course +

- matchstick +

- either : +
-> You can keep one of the photos. *Either*(`=one or the other of two; it does not matter which （两者中的）任何一个`) of them -- whichever you like. 你可以保留一张照片。两张里任选一张—拣你喜欢的。 +
-> You can park *on either side of the street*. 这条街两边都可停车。 +
-> There's a door *at either(`=each of two （两者中的）每个，各方`) end* of the corridor. 走廊两端各有一道门。 +
-> I know a good Italian restaurant. It's not far from here, *either*(`=used to add extra information to a statement （补充时说）而且`). 我知道一家很好的意大利餐馆，而且离这儿不远。 +
-> Pete can't go *and I can't either*(`=used after negative phrases to state that a feeling or situation is similar to one already mentioned （用于否定词组后）也`). 皮特不能去，我也不能。
====


Why not *build a team* [by *introducing* its members and *explaining* what you *want* each of them *to do*]? It is a lot cheaper. It also *wastes* a lot less of everybody’s valuable time.

为什么不通过这样的方式 -- 介绍成员, 并向他们每个人解释你想让他们做什么 -- 来创建一个团队呢? 便宜多了。它也令每个人的宝贵时间, 更少被浪费。

Will `主` *following* these eight rules `谓` *lead to* instant business success? Of course not. None of this *will work* [if the company *lacks* an attractive product or a decent(a.)(`=of a good enough standard or quality 像样的；相当不错的；尚好的`) business plan]. But these rules *might just make your firm* a more efficient and pleasant place to work. And that *is* a reasonable(`=*~ (to do sth)* : fair, practical and sensible 公平的；合理的；有理由的；明智的`) goal for 2020.


遵循这8条规则, 会让你的事业立即成功? 当然不会。如果公司缺乏有吸引力的产品, 或像样的商业计划，光凭上面的8条建议, 都不会直接就帮助你商业成功。但这些规则有可能让你的公司, 变成一个更有效率、更愉快的工作场所。这是在2020年中可以实施的有价值的目标。

So `主` the manager, *as well as* the staff member, `谓` *needs to learn a lesson from the failure*.

4-. *Make your priorities* (for the next year) *clear*, and *communicate them well*. *Is* the company (or division) *trying to launch a new product*? Or *to boost(v.) sales of existing products*? Or *to control costs*? If you *are not sure*, then `主` those who *work for* you `谓` *will have no idea*. That *can lead to* a lot of wasted effort.

5-. To that end, *cut out* the jargon. `主` The use of pretentious phrases and complex acronyms `谓` *is generally designed* to obfuscate(v.) *rather than* elucidate(v.). In Bartleby’s experience, `主` the reason (people *use* unclear language) `系` *is that* they *have nothing clear to say*.

If it *is* `表` just *to update* people *on* progress, that *can be done* [in an email /or in a one-to-one conversation (which *has* the added benefit of *allowing* you *to talk to* your staff)]. `主` Big meetings *involving* all the staff `谓` *should be reserved for* big news like acquisitions or lay-offs.

- etch => 来自词根ed, 吃，词源同eat, edible.

`主` *Selling* equipment *to* industry giants like Applied Materials 应用材料(公司名) in America `谓` *makes* it a small success for the semiconductor supply chain. Much of the rest of the industry *is not doing so well*.

富创总部位于沈阳，距离北京东北方向5小时车程。富创是全球最重要、最复杂的供应链的最底层:该供应链生产智能手机和服务器上的集成电路或芯片。富创的机器人为设备制造零部件，这些零部件将被安装在台湾和俄勒冈州的工厂里，用于在硅上蚀刻电路和制造芯片。向诸如美国应用材料这样的行业巨头公司, 出售设备，使富创公司在半导体供应链领域中, 取得了小小的成功。但该行业的其它许多企业, 则做得不是很好。

`主` Failure(n.) *to make* cutting-edge 前沿;尖端的 chips `系` *is not* exactly China’s fault. It is a difficult industry *to kick-start*(`=to do sth to help a process or project start more quickly 促使…开始；使（项目）尽快启动; / 用脚踏启动（摩托车）`).

The technology itself *is* even more complex *than* an internal-combustion(燃烧;燃烧过程)  内燃机的；内燃的 engine.

The intellectual property behind cutting-edge processes *is fiercely*(`=(especially of actions or emotions 尤指动作或情感) showing strong feelings or a lot of activity, often in a way that is violent 狂热的；强烈的；猛烈的`) *guarded*.

[In many ways] the manufacturing 制造业 of chips `谓` *represents* the supreme(a.)(`=highest in rank or position （级别或地位）最高的，至高无上的;/very great or the greatest in degree （程度）很大的，最大的`) technological challenge for China, an amalgamation(`=the combination of two or more commercial companies 融合，混合`) of all the other challenges (*presented* in this report).

====
- supreme : a. +
=> super-上,超过 → supreme +
-> *the Supreme(`=highest in rank or position （级别或地位）最高的，至高无上的`) Commander* of the armed forces 武装力量的最高统帅 +
-> *a supreme(`=very great or the greatest in degree （程度）很大的，最大的`) effort* 最大的努力
====

It will have to *call upon*(`=*call on/upon sb* : to ask or demand that sb do sth 请求，要求，要（某人做某事）`) everything it *has learned from* successes and failures like nuclear plants 核电厂 and engines [if it *is* to succeed].


在制造尖端芯片上失败, 并不完全是中国的错。这本身就是一个很难启动的行业。用于生产这种芯片的工厂, 非常昂贵。这项技术本身甚至比内燃机还要复杂。尖端工艺背后的知识产权, 也受到严格保护。在许多方面，制造芯片, 对中国来说是最大的技术挑战，融合了本报告提出的所有其他挑战。如果中国想要取得成功，它就必须从成功和失败中吸取一切教训，如同对从核电站和发动机的研发中吸取教训一样。

The Chinese government *is trying hard* (the country’s biggest chip factory, SMIC, a private firm, *has settled* many suits(n.)(`=to file/bring a suit against sb 起诉；控告某人`) over IP theft).

In October the government *raised*(`=to bring or collect money or people together; to manage to get or form sth 筹募；征集；召集；组建`) 204bn yuan ($29bn) *from* the finance ministry, state-owned firms and local governments *for* its domestic chipmaking efforts. That *followed* 139bn yuan (*raised* in 2014).

The problem *is that* the government’s chip programme *is optimising*(v.)(`=optimize : to make sth as good as it can be; to use sth in the best possible way 使最优化；充分利用`) *for* the wrong thing.

Instead of *trying to stimulate*(`=to make sth develop or become more active; to encourage sth 促进；激发；激励`) a domestic chip industry *to meet* China’s huge market needs, the funds *are being spent on* trying to reach parity(n.)(`=*~ (with sb/sth) /~ (between A and B)* :  (formal) the state of being equal, especially the state of having equal pay or status （尤指薪金或地位）平等，相同，对等`) with chip companies like Intel.

中国政府正在努力(该国最大的芯片工厂中芯国际，一家私营公司，已经解决了许多关于知识产权盗窃的诉讼)。去年10月，政府从财政部、国有企业和地方政府手中, 筹集了2040亿元人民币(合290亿美元)，用于国内芯片研发。这是继2014年人民币1390亿元之后的又一次融资。但问题是, 政府的这个芯片项目, 资金用错了地方。这些钱并没有用在促进国内芯片工业的整体发展上, 以满足中国巨大的市场需求，而是却被用在了试图创建一个同英特尔(Intel)等芯片公司平起平坐的中国巨头上。

Chips *are* a vital product *to* China because they *are fundamental*(a.)(`=~ (to sth) central; forming the necessary basis of sth 基础的；基本的`) *to* any technology-led 以科技为先导的 growth that the country *desires* for its future, as well as *for* making weapons.

PwC, a consultancy 咨询公司, *estimates that* the global market for chips *will grow* by 4.6% a year, *to be* worth(a.) $575bn in 2022, *driven by* the requirements of cars, AI systems and communications networks.

对中国来说, 芯片是一种至关重要的产品，因为它对任何以技术为主导的增长来说, 都是最基础的必备的东西(正如同它对武器制造一样). 而中国正希望它的未来发展, 是以科技为先导的. +

普华永道(PwC)咨询公司估计, 受人们对汽车、人工智能系统, 和通信网络的需求推动的影响, 全球芯片市场, 每年会以4.6%的速度增长，到2022年, 将达到5750亿美元市场价值。


Currently a huge share of that market value *moves* through China, but *is not captured by* it. `主` The 418bn chips the country imported in 2018 `谓` *cost* $312bn, a quarter more than it *spent* importing crude oil. And beyond *grabbing* a larger part of the value chain for itself, `主` *controlling* the production of chips `谓` *would also give* China indirect control over myriad(n.)(`=an extremely large number of sth 无数；大量`) other industries, *from* social networking *to* personal computing.

目前，其中很大一部分市场价值流经中国，但并未被中国掌控。中国2018年时进口了4180亿枚芯片, 价值3120亿美元，比它进口原油所花的钱, 还多出四分之一。除了能自己控制该价值链上的很大一部分外，控制芯片的生产, 还能使中国间接地控制大量的相关行业 -- 从社交网络到个人电脑领域。

Most of the state-led efforts *have failed* so far. SMIC *is* on the verge of *producing* chips at levels of sophistication(n.)(`=the quality of being sophisticated 世故；复杂巧妙；高水平`) *roughly equivalent to* those *reached by* Intel a decade ago.

The firm *has also started shipping*(v.) more complex components *to* its suppliers, *simplifying* what its customers have to do [while *capturing* more of the value of the final product].

迄今为止，大多数由国家主导的努力都以失败告终。中芯国际即将生产出的芯片，其复杂程度大致相当于英特尔(Intel) 10年前达到的水平。其营收(2018年为34亿美元)约为台湾竞争对手台积电的十分之一。中芯国际还没有以其质量和可靠性闻名于世。 +
但Fortune公司则在进步。该公司曾将其金属部件, 运往日本和台湾的第三方合作公司, 来进行清理。但是今天, 它已经不需要这样做了。该公司有了自己的洁净室，在那里，他们将光亮的铝制部件, 打磨成光滑的灰色涂层，然后用厚塑料进行真空包装。该公司还开始向供应商海运更复杂的组件，简化了客户必须做的事情，同时在最终产品上获取到了更多价值。

Even though Alibaba *relied on* TSMC in Taiwan *to fabricate*(`= to make or produce goods, equipment, etc. from various different materials 制造；装配；组装;/编造；捏造`) the chips, AI engineers in the Valley *remarked on* the Hanguang’s performance, *stating that* it *had beaten* all other chips in its class.

尽管中国企业在芯片制造方面仍然落后，但它们最近在为人工智能应用设计芯片方面, 却取得了一些成功。9月下旬，中国科技巨头阿里巴巴(Alibaba), 发布了一款专门用于执行机器学习任务的芯片, “含光800”(Hanguang 800)，这使得硅谷的书呆子们议论纷纷。尽管阿里巴巴依赖于台湾的台积电(TSMC), 才能制造出芯片，但硅谷的人工智能工程师们, 对汉光的表现做出了评价，称其性能击败了同类芯片中的所有其它芯片。这超出了人们的预期，因为人们一直觉得, 中国的水平还远远落后于美国的芯片公司。

Faster, higher, stronger

更快、更高、更强

[On November 6th] the latest results of MLPerf, an industry-standard benchmark(`=something which can be measured and used as a standard that other things can be compared with 基准`) for AI chips, *were published*.

They *showed that* the Hanguang 800 chip *was performing* a standardised(`=standardize : to make objects or activities of the same type have the same features or qualities; to make sth standard 使标准化；使符合标准（或规格）`) machine-learning task *13 times faster than* the chip that Intel *had just released* (see chart).

The comparison *is not* totally fair, as the Alibaba chip *was made* physically larger than the Intel chip, *letting* it *draw* more power /and *perform* more calculations [per second].

But even *compared with* a bigger chip from Nvidia *called* the Titan RTX, the Hanguang 800 *clocked*(v.)(`= to reach a particular time or speed 达到（某时间或速度）`) in four times faster.

11月6日，人工智能芯片行业标准基准MLPerf的最新结果发布。他们发现，含光800芯片执行标准化机器学习任务的速度, 比英特尔刚刚发布的芯片快13倍(见图表)。这种比较并不完全公平，因为阿里巴巴芯片的体积比英特尔芯片大，可以吸收更多的能量，每秒进行更多的计算。但即使与英伟达(Nvidia)生产的更大芯片Titan RTX相比，含光800的速度也快了四倍。

There *are* probably more caveats(n.)(`=caveat : a warning that particular things need to be considered before sth can be done 警告；告诫`). Alibaba *ran* only one out of five tests. Poor performance in the others *would betray* a chip (over-optimised for one task). But [even in the most pessimistic 悲观的；悲观主义的 scenario(`=a description of how things might happen in the future 设想；方案；预测;/（电影或戏剧的）剧情梗概`)] it *is* impressive.

`主` That a Chinese company *has designed* an AI chip which *performs as well as, or better than*, its Western competitors `谓` *should alert*(`=*~ sb to sth* : to make sb aware of sth 使意识到；使认识到`) American politicians and innovators *to* China’s progress in this area.

可能还有更多的警示。阿里巴巴只进行了五项测试中的一项。如果其他芯片表现不佳，就会暴露出这是一个对某一项任务进行了过度优化的芯片。但即使在最悲观的情况下，这种成就也令人印象深刻。一家中国公司设计出了一种性能与西方竞争对手相当, 甚至更好的人工智能芯片，这应该让美国政界人士和创新者注意到, 中国在这一领域正在进步。

Whereas （用以比较或对比两个事实）然而，但是，尽管 `主` Fortune’s more industrial flavour(`=a particular quality or atmosphere 特点；特色；气氛;/（某种）味道`) of success in the manufacturing supply chain `谓` *took* a traditional route for Chinese firms -- *start*(v.) at the bottom /and *work up*(`=*work up to sth* : to develop or move gradually towards sth, usually sth more exciting or extreme 逐步发展到，逐渐达到（更高或更深的程度）`) --  `主` Alibaba’s success in designing a chip `系` *is* more interesting.

It *is rooted in* its wide deployment(`=The deployment of troops, resources, or equipment is the organization and positioning of them so that they are ready for quick action. 部署`) of machine-learning systems *across* its business, *both* in its Taobao online market *and* its Hema shops on the high street(`=*high street* : the main street of a town, where most shops/stores, banks, etc. are 大街（城镇的主要商业街道）`).

The firm *processes* billions of images a day *as part of* its normal operations, and `主` the machine-learning software it *has trained* to do that work `系` *is* now very accurate and powerful.

然而，Fortune公司在制造业供应链方面的成功, 还是更多地体现了中国企业的传统路线——从底层开始，一步步往上爬 —— 但阿里巴巴在芯片设计方面的成功, 却更有趣。该芯片被应用在广泛部署的机器学习系统上, 包括线上的淘宝(Taobao)商城, 和线下的城市大街上的Hema盒马鲜生店中。该公司每天要处理数十亿张图片，这是其企业正常运作的一部分，而它所训练的用于该工作的机器学习软件, 现在已经非常精确和强大。

The Hanguang 800’s designers *spent* a lot of time *sitting next to* the coders 程序员;编码器；编码员 who *built* those algorithms(`=a set of rules that must be followed when solving a particular problem 算法；计算程序`).

Their job *was* to work out how to render(v.)(`= *~ sth (as sth) /~ sth (into sth)* :  to express sth in a different language （用不同的语言）表达；翻译；把…译成`) the algorithms in silicon, so *the more time* they could spend learning from engineers (*writing* high-performance algorithms), *the better*.

“含光800”的设计者们, 花了很多时间坐在编写这些算法的程序员旁边。他们的工作是, 研究如何翻译硅芯片中的程序算法. 因此,他们与写算法的芯片工程师共同呆的时间越长, 他们做的就越好.


By *being close to* the market in which AI *is used*, like Taobao’s and Alibaba’s offline shops, the Hanguang designers *were able to tweak*(`=to make slight changes to a machine, system, etc. to improve it 稍稍调整（机器、系统等）;/to pull or twist sth suddenly 扭；拧；扯`) the design of the chip *to optimise* its performance on those tasks.

Indeed, in many ways, `主` the data-labelling grunt work(`=*grunt work* : 简单的，枯燥乏味的工作`) (that *makes* Alibaba’s machine-learning algorithms *as good as* 和…几乎一样，实际上等于… they are) `谓` *translates directly into* the high performance of its new chip.

====

`主` China’s strength 力量; 实力 in data-labelling at the very bottom of the AI supply chain `谓` *is translating into* design strength at the top.

通过紧密接触那些运用上了AI的市场, 比如淘宝和阿里巴巴的线下商店, 含光芯片的设计者们, 就能够对芯片, 进行设计上的微调, 以优化它的运行. 事实上，在很多方面，让阿里巴巴的机器学习算法变得如此出色的数据标签繁琐工作，能直接转化为其新芯片的高性能。中国的实力, 正在从处于人工智能供应链最底层的数据标签上, 转向顶层的设计能力上。

While Hanguang 800 *is* remarkable, Alibaba’s design work *is* a far less capital-intensive(a.)(`=needing large amounts of money in order to operate well 资本密集的`), less complex process(`=a series of things that are done in order to achieve a particular result （为达到某一目标的）过程；进程`) *than* the physical manufacture of a chip (which, in Hanguang’s case, *was still done* in Taiwan).

在半导体供应链的其他部分，情况就不那么乐观了。几位不愿透露姓名的高管表示，在试图追赶英特尔(Intel)或台湾台积电(TSMC)等西方巨头的过程中，刺激计划走错了地方。这些高管要求不具名批评政府政策。虽然含光800不同凡响，但阿里巴巴的设计工作远没有实际制造芯片那么资金密集，也不那么复杂(在含光的案例中，芯片制造仍然是在台湾完成的)。

If `主` *catching up on* internal-combustion(`=the process of burning 燃烧;/燃烧过程`) engines `系` *was* hard, `主` *doing so* [on traditional semiconductor manufacturing] `系` *will be close to* impossible.

如果说追赶内燃机很难，那么追赶传统半导体制造业几乎是不可能的。芯片市场变化很快。相反，政府应该专注于刺激针对物联网等中端市场和人工智能等新兴领域的, 芯片设计和制造。

In one way 在某点上；从某种意义上来讲, China’s challenge with chips *is* even harder *than* the problem it *faced with* combustion-engine 内燃机 cars. There *is* no completely new technology (`主` *arriving* which `谓` *will free China from* the need *to catch up with* the rest of the world). But China’s chip companies *should still listen to* the market, *not chase* prestige.

在某种程度上，中国在芯片方面面临的挑战, 甚至比它在内燃机汽车方面面临的问题, 还要严峻。世界上不存在一种全新的技术, 可以将中国从追赶世界其他国家的需求中一劳永逸地解放出来。但中国的芯片公司, 仍应倾听市场的声音，而不是追逐声誉。

Getting good at designing is easier than at manufacturing, however



Jan 2nd 2020

THE FORTUNE PRECISION EQUIPMENT COMPANY *makes* chunks of metal. Hulking sheets of it *are cut* [with millimetre accuracy] *using* robot arms (in room-sized enclosures *bearing* the brand of their German or Japanese manufacturers). The white spray of cooling lubricant *makes* the process *look like* an industrial-strength shower for some post-modern Cleopatra.

*Based* in Shenyang, five hours north-east of Beijing by train, Fortune *is* the bottom rung of the most important and complex supply chain on Earth: the one which *produces* the integrated circuits, or chips, *found* in smartphones and servers. Fortune’s robots *make* parts *for* equipment which *will be installed* in factories in Taiwan and Oregon, and *used* to etch(v.) circuitry on silicon /and *make* chips. `主` *Selling* equipment *to* industry giants like Applied Materials in America `谓` *makes* it a small success for the semiconductor supply chain. Much of the rest of the industry *is not doing so well*.

Failure(n.) to make cutting-edge chips *is not* exactly China’s fault. It *is* a difficult industry *to kick-start*. `主` The factories that produce(v.) the chips `系` *are* phenomenally expensive. The technology itself *is* even more complex than an internal-combustion engine. The intellectual property behind cutting-edge processes *is fiercely guarded*. [In many ways] the manufacturing of chips *represents* the supreme technological challenge for China, an amalgamation of all the other challenges (*presented* in this report). It *will have to call upon* everything it has learned from successes and failures like nuclear plants and engines [if it *is* to succeed].

The Chinese government *is trying hard* (the country’s biggest chip factory, SMIC, a private firm, *has settled* many suits over IP theft). In October the government *raised* 204bn yuan ($29bn) *from* the finance ministry, state-owned firms and local governments *for* its domestic chipmaking efforts. That *followed* 139bn yuan raised(v.) in 2014. The problem *is that* the government’s chip programme *is optimising for* the wrong thing.
