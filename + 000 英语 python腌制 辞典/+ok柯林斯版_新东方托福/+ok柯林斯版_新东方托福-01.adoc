.jump:
电影《泰坦尼克号》里的男主角说过一句经典台词：“You jump. I jump. 你跳，我就跳。”这里，动词“jump”**泛指“双脚离地，向空中弹起”**的动作。 +

=> The jaguar jumped onto the back of its prey. 这只美洲豹跳到了其猎物的背上。  +
=> The burglar escaped by jumping out of the window. 入室窃贼跳出窗外逃跑了。 +

.skip:
- skip 指哪种“跳”呢？我们可以通过**想象一个小孩子开心地蹦蹦跳跳的样子**，来理解它所指的具体动作。Skip 通常来描述**“小步地跳，轻快地跳”。**在英式英语中，“跳绳”这项运动就叫“skipping”，而跳绳所用的工具就是“skipping rope”。 +
- skip 做动词还有另一个常见的意思，表示“跳过、省略”. +

=> The kid is skipping down the street with an ice-cream in her hand. 那个孩子手里拿着冰淇淋，在街上一蹦一跳地走着。 +
=> The ticket for the castle was too expensive, so I skipped it and moved on to the next attraction. 参观城堡的门票价格太贵了，所以我就直接去了下一个景点。 +

.hop:
- 名词 hopscotch 是孩子们喜欢玩的“跳房子”，根据游戏规则需要，参与者有时应该**用同一条腿向前跳跃。**日常生活中，我们也能用 hop 来**表示“单腿跳”**。 +
- Hop *还可以指“兔子、鸟等小型动物双足或齐足向前跳”。* +
- 在很多城市中有一种特色的旅游观光车，乘客根据需要可以随时上下车，这种巴士的名称是“*hop-on, hop-off bus*”。这里用“hop”是因为我们在口语中还会使用它来表示**“迅速上下车”**的意思。 +

=> I hurt my ankle, so I had to hop all the way home. 我把脚踝扭伤了，所以只能一路单腿蹦回家。 +
=> The bunny is hopping around in the grass. 这只小兔子正在草丛间蹦蹦跳跳。 +
=> A: Could you give me a ride home?  B: Sure. Hop on!  +

image:img/hop.jpg[,10%]


.leap:
- leap 所指的“跳”和“skip 轻快地跳”和“hop 单腿跳”不同，**leap 形容“纵身一跃，骤然一跳”，这个动作通常需要更大的力量，而且更加突然。 **
- 另外，每四年一度的“*闰年*”在英语里的说法是“*leap year*”，这是一个固定搭配。

=> I leapt to catch the falling vase. 我纵身一跃，想要接住正在倒下的花瓶。 +
=> When the balloon popped, my cat leapt out of my arms and ran upstairs. 气球破了，发出一声巨响，我的猫瞬间从我的臂弯一跃而出，跑上了楼。 +

image:img/leap.jpg[,20%]


.总结:
jump 泛指一切“跳跃”的动作，通常做不及物动词，而在做及物动词时表示“跃过障碍物”； +
skip 的意思是“轻快地小步跳”； +
hop 常用的意思包括“用单腿跳”和“小动物蹦蹦跳跳”，在口语使用中可以指“上下车”； +
leap 用来描述“充满力量的跳跃”这类动作。
